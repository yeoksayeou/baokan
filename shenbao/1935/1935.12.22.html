<h3>英國政治上之大波瀾</h3>
<p>— 華</p>
<p>自從霍爾賴伐爾調解意阿戰爭的方案發表後各方面的反響至爲强烈在英國內部輿論多表示不滿政府中保守黨的左翼亦未能加以諒解反對派方面自然更耍施以不容情的攻擊到了本月十八日霍爾乃突然辭去外相的職位十九日英國會下院開會有鮑爾溫與霍爾的辯解的演說有工黨動議對政府的彈劾案又有張伯倫與戴爾頓等代表政府黨與反對黨的激烈的辯論這是總選舉後新政府成立以來第一個政治上的大波浪霍爾的引退原是鮑爾溫內閣用以保全自己地位的不得已的一著但這一著對於現在保守黨政府的打擊確是很大的關於外相的繼任人選就是一個難題這一個政治波浪對於國際外交上的影響也是很大的英法的合作英意的對立現在正處於極端微妙複雜的關鍵上而這個關鍵也卽是决定歐洲的和戰分配未來的陣容的關鍵我們試就這個政治波浪的各種關係作一簡略的觀察</p>
<p>本年英國的總選舉乃是保守黨政府利用意阿戰爭的時機以一致對外的口號博取內政上的勝利的一種策略意阿戰爭使英帝國傳統的生命綫受到威脅又使歐洲的戰禍迫近了一步在這種危機之下保守黨政府正好表示一種堅强的外交策略從對德海軍妥協對意　糾紛盡力調解對法積極拉攏到最近的堅决擁護國聯盟的發動對意制裁保守黨政府用以炫耀於英國民衆的是力圖避免戰爭保障集體和平衰老了的英帝國主義不像少壯的意帝國主義它所需要的是和平妥協維持現有的國際均勢英國的民衆自然也是愛好和平的這樣保守黨政府便能以和平政策的號召來博取一般民衆的擁護然而如何纔能達到和平的途徑呢這却是英帝國當局所不能解决的難題</p>
<p>在鮑爾溫與霍爾主持下的英帝國外交政策對於意阿戰爭的和平解决是在兩條路徑上徘徊着一條是幾個相關的帝國主義間的秘　談判以半殖民地的阿比西尼亞爲犧牲品而達到它們中間的和平妥協一條是以國際和平機關的國聯爲基體根據堂皇的國聯盟約用公開的調解以至對侵略者的制裁達到和平在本年意阿戰爭爆發之前艾登與霍爾曾經一决决的運用秘密談判的外交希望以阿此西尼亞作單獨的犧牲品解决英意間的對立法國因爲要同時取好於英意兩面所以也是贊成這種分贓式的和平妥協的但意國的慾望很大秘密的分　不得成功意阿戰爭終於爆發了因爲上面的一條路走不通英國就改取後面的一條這是艾登和霍爾接連發表許多堂皇的演說主張擁護集體和平尊重國聯盟的的由來這種堂皇的表示居然博得了國際人土的好評也受到了英國民衆的贊許然而保守黨政府對於國聯盟的和集體和平的擁護與其說是一種誠意不如說是一種策略經濟制裁的發動不過是一種壓力其作用是要使意國讓步依舊接受秘密分贓的辦法而已所謂霍爾賴伐爾的調解方案差不多要把阿國的領土割去一半以饜足意國的慾望就是一個證明然而當慕索里尼　在半推半就之際在阿比西尼亞方面日內瓦方面以至英國的民衆及世界的與論方面已發生了强烈的反響保守黨政府的信譽突然失墜結果霍爾乃不能不掛冠引退</p>
<p>爲了鞏固現政府的地位繼霍爾而爲英外相的必然是保守黨方面一個更有聲望更有手腕的人物大概是張伯倫兄弟中的一個但現在我們不必去預測總之無論如何在最近保守黨政府必定要表示一點對於國聯的更堅决的擁護和對於意國的更强硬的態度以挽回英國民衆的同情相同的在法國方面賴伐爾政府也必然要稍稍收斂其對於秘密外交的傾向以保全他的地位這樣歐洲帝國主義的對立雖然仍舊不能得到緩和但各國民衆對於集體和平制度的擁護却已經表現出更大的力量了</p>

<p>朋友！當你跨上汽輪，離開了廣州，沿着西江南下，約莫經過兩個多鐘頭的光景，你便可以抵達叫做順德的一個縣份。在地理形勢上，順德是位在珠江下游一個三角洲的正中，她的東北接番禺縣，東南接中山縣，而新會縣隣其西南，南海縣隣其西北。境內多平原而略低窪，士壤肥沃，並且河道縱橫，交通非常便利。順德全縣人口據民國十九年的統計，有一百四十二萬六千餘人，分別聚居於二百一十四鄉，人民大都以養蠶爲主要生產事業，的在一百萬人左右</p>
<p>蠶農的住居</p>
<p>到了順德，最先吸着人們的視綫的，恐怕就是蠶農的住居。大概普通的蠶農，是在桑田附近，聚族而居，由三數家乃至數十家，組合而成，組合的方式，有相毘連至數里的，也有聚居於一隅的。他們住房的建造，很是簡單，泥牆草瓦，到處都是一樣，室內自然是泥地，窗牖極少，不透空氣，光錢亦極晦暗。他們的寢室與蠶室大都是混合不分，平日蠶兒與人兒堆在一起，其侷促狀態可想而知。還有一部分遷徙無定的貧苦的蠶農，他們的住居，是散佈於桑田中，建築是他們自己臨時做的，比上述的一類自然來得更形簡陋，遠望過去，祗見茅寮點點，倐隱倐現於桑叢中，使人陡起了太古社會的童景。</p>
<p>蠶農的耕地</p>
<p>順德的蠶農，自己耕有桑基很多，大概是毘連或隣近於自己的居宅。他們所耕的面積大小不等，平均由二畝至二十畝爲最多，據統計報吿，每戶蠶農平均耕有桑基爲七。二二畝，但百之九十二以上的士地，是向地主租來的。每畝的地租由八元至四十元不等，要看魚塘的面積之大小和土地的肥瘠而定。普通計算，魚搪佔桑基面積爲百分之二十九的，每畝年租的二十一元。這裏所謂魚塘與桑基，還得要說個明白，就是廣東的蠶區，因爲地勢低窪，蠶農經營桑基，都是採取「四水六基」制，譬如十畝桑基，其中就應有四畝闢爲魚池。初到順德的人，看見到處都是淸漪的池水，碧綠的桑麻，莫不戚到另有一番田園的風味。</p>
<p>蠶農的作業</p>
<p>他們主要的作業當然是栽桑與育蠶，每年的三月中旬，蠶造便開始，一家大小，都總動員，大概壯年的男女，多任摘桑及飼蠶的工作，老婦穉孩，則從事執蠶，柑繭，及繅絲與佐理家務等事。因爲廣東矢氣溫和，每年蠶事可達六七造之多，最忙的時候，他們竟連睡眠的時間都缺乏。說到這裏，我們不得不一提技術的問題，就是蠶農們雖勤勞，可是他們從育蠶起以至於繅絲及織綢止，在生產技術上都是不合理的，守舊的，非科學的，今後應怎樣改進，實是一個急待解决的問題。除育蠶外，養魚就是他們主要的副業，他們把蠶沙蠶蛹及蠶蛾當做魚的飼料，又可利用塘中泥質以壅培桑地，頗覺合算的一樁生產副業</p>
<p>蠶農的敎育</p>
<p>順德的成年蠶農之曾受過敎育的極少，據調查結果，一百人中，能粗通文字的只有九人，就是學齡兒童之未入學的亦佔百分之六七十。因爲缺乏敎育的綠故，蠶農的行爲常陷於迷信，當他們養蠶的時候，倘若遇到蠶的病害，及其他的損失，他們都諉諸鬼神，信託天命，毫不設法補救。崇拜蠶娘的幾乎家家都是，其他如相契石頭坭偶，以求庇護的，亦復不少。我們到了蠶村所見，無論是街隅巷角，都是纍纍石卵，香烟繚繞，這，就是他們的保佑之神，就是他們靈魂的主宰，又是一個何等嚴重的敎育問題！</p>
<p>蠶農的健康</p>
<p>順德蠶農的健康，就我們從表面上的觀察，當然已知道是不好的現象，據順德蠶絲改良實施區於民國廿二年對於一百零五個家庭健康的調查，統計內有人口四百五十七人，其中不健全者佔一百三十三人，同年，對於一百家兒童夭亡之調查，統計出生之五百八十二個兒童中，夭亡的竟達二百三十四人。又根據該實施區總區對於本年十月份之治療報吿，在一閱月中應診之病人，皮膚病八十八人，耳鼻喉病八十人，內科九十四人，外科一百三十二人，蟲病八人，牙病四人，痧眼及其他病七十五人，留醫二人，統計達三百九十七人，而該總區所轄之人口，亦不過四五千左右。於此，蠶農的健康程度，直可以不言而喩了。</p>
<p>蠶農的經濟收入</p>
<p>在過去，順德原是一個很富的縣份，民國十一年，廣東省生絲的輸出值一億一千餘萬元，大部分就是操在順德人的手裏，那時節，他們是人間的幸運者，他們過的是極度優裕的生活，平日置酒歡呼，酣歌嬉舞，閭巷交閉。可是自從受了世界經濟恐慌，絲價慘跌；及因自己的生產技術太落後，失去了市塲後，全縣的蠶業，已日趨凋零，到了今日，更是陷於破產的狀態，據最近的調查，全縣年內能稍有盈餘之蠶戶，僅佔百分之四，進支差强相抵的亦不過百分之四，而每年須受虧損之累的竟達百分之九十二。結果，輟業的輟業，失業的失業，負債的負債，大家都掙扎到死亡錢上的邊沿了。</p>
<p>順德，整個順德的蠶農的生活，它所展示我們的就是這麼一幀悽惋的，更是水深火熱的畫圖。</p>

<h3>中國鉛筆廠參觀記（續）</h3>
<p>— 黃幼雄</p>
<p>一·國產鉛筆之發軔　二·鉛筆製造原料　三·鉛筆製造要點　四·筆心製造程序　五·筆軸製作程序　六·機械設備　七·其他出品　八·中國鉛筆廠略歷</p>
<p>（五）筆軸製作程序</p>
<p>木料是用椴木，先已裁成簽條一般大小的。每一塊木板，是製筆桿的一半，兩板起槽，以便容納鉛心，拼合起來可得五枝筆桿。但是這部工作，也不容易，因爲取初木板不甚乾燥，須在烘板機中烘乾，的烘四五小時，取出紮牢，以防其起偏歪不平之弊。如是者放置一個月，始送往心槽製造機中起細槽，那槽不消說須十分精密，不能過寬過窄的。有了槽，於是裝上鉛心塗上膠水，把兩板合起來，緊束起來，再加烘燥，這纔可以做鉋圓分枝的工作。</p>
<p>從二板膠合而成的軸板，先鋸去了兩端的不齊處，送至鉋床，則板之一面便鉋成五個半圓之軸桿，反過來再一鉋，那末兩個半圓合成圓形，一支支的圓鉛筆便隨着鉋刀而落下了。這已成了鉛筆，但未曾修飾美觀而已。修飾的方法不消說是把圓形磨光，而後加以油漆，。磨光容易油漆少則七次，多至二十决。而所用顏料又是非先經磨細不可的。此後再用噴漆，使有光輝，再把尾端切除，以增美觀。最後以鉛箔打上製造廠的印字，牌號，包裝，才去到商塲中求售。</p>
<p>（六）機械設備</p>
<p>一枝小小的鉛筆，牠的製作程序，竟是這樣的麻煩，讀者見了以後，總也覺得是意想不到的。但是麻煩雖麻煩，却因爲一切工作都用的是機器，電力只要管理得好，到也不覺得吃力。不但磨搗都借機械之力，就是鉋床的除去木屑，燒心爐的加油送風，都用自動裝置，油漆用機械，打印用機械，處處都是機械，人只要管理着機械，又有什麼困難呢？則以中國鉛筆廠規模雖不算大，每天的出品，目前可以有到五十至一百籮，最多可以出至二百至三百籮。他的牌號，現用飛機牌及鼎牌兩種，飛機牌中又有「小朋友」，「好學生」，「學生國貨年」，「航室救國」等，這裏不必詳細介紹了。</p>
<p>（七）其他出品</p>
<p>以上所說，是專指普通黑鉛心的鉛筆而言，同時中國鉛筆廠還製造種種高級鉛筆，以及色筆和普通鉛筆之不同，即前者是不用筆鉛，而代以膠汁顏科。所用的粘土須格外細密，往往硏磨至七——十天之久。放入顏料後，蒸煮一天，滾壓壓後，其餘與製普通鉛筆相同。</p>
<p>（八）中國鉛筆廠略歷中國鉛筆廠於民國二十二年冬間發起，二十三年七月開始籌備，資本五萬元，其時籌備主任爲央　梅章偉士二君，吳君畢業於日本橫濱高工應用化學科，曾在日本眞崎大和鉛筆株式會社中實習年餘，故對對此業，富有學識經騐。籌備時期雖極其忽促，但以本年三月，各項機器已陸續布置完竣。一面訓練工人，採辦原料，六月底即有出品，以其完全國貨，故頗受社會之歡迎。本年十一月八日該廠正式開幕。此後但希望其出品日精，產量日增，以供國人之採用，以塞國家之漏巵而已。（完）</p>

<h3>申園籃球房客滿　良華大勝麥令　成績五十七比三十三　李震中妙射大受衆賞</h3>
<p>良華籃球隊來滬、昨晚第一戰、以五十七比三十三、大勝麥令斯、李震中射籃之妙、博得采聲不少、全隊合作工夫甚佳、聯絡純熟、將來對付海賊、當更可觀、滬上晚近好籃球不多、故昨晚趨申園觀賽、達二千人之數、偌大之申園籃球房、一時竟宣吿客滿、良華之號召力、可謂不小、</p>
<p>良華風度如昔　今歲之麥令、實力較往年不如甚多、在西靑聯賽、位列甚低、故良華之得勝、本屬意料中之事、後衛軟弱、射籃無方、僅恃祥生之獨手連中耳、良華風度翩翩、一如往昔、李震中之射籃、最受衆賞、劉振元似較進步、唐寳堃則反覺碌碌、兩後衛穩健非凡、張景實更爲可取、惟昨晚犯規過多、則爲美中不足、在進攻之時、每以傳遞周折過多、往往弄巧成拙、反失去機會、</p>
<p>開塲局勢緊張　接觸之後、麥令即取攻勢、祥生在籃下一揮、先開紀錄、劉振元回奉一球、平分秋色、皮雷士之一擲、麥令又佔先、李震中張量實先後得分、麥令亦頗不示弱、兩隊互相上下、以一分相出入、良華苦戰、力謀打開出路、終覺不甚得手、格力芬之一中、麥令叉以十六比十四佔先、幸李震中連擲連中、良華才再以十八比十六超出、形勢之緊張、即此可見、</p>
<p>良華從此轉機　麥令憑其高大之身材、以窘良華、旋見亦殊難得手、此時突以惠愛德入替格力芬、充任中鋒、從此良華、遂得轉機、踏靑雲而扶搖直上、李震中張景實劉振元、三雄結義、分數迭增不已、麥令則依然故我、僅僅罰中一分、上半時之結果、爲二十九比十七、良華佔先十二分、</p>
<p>麥令一蹶不振　擰檬時間後、良華益發揮其威力、水到渠成、頗有隨心所欲之便、麥令一蹶不振、毫無辦法、比數已成五十比二十七、相差達二十三分、張景實尹鴻祥兩後衛、此時先後以四决犯規罰出、然已不能動搖大局、結果爲五十七比二十三、良華大勝、</p>
<h3>西靑籃球　靑光首次獲勝　曁南輕取南星</h3>
<p>西靑籃球昨賽、戰情平淡、毫無可觀、靑光之勝滬江、下半時曾被罰出兩人、以三人支持殘局、猶能保持勝利、結果四十七對三十六、暨南在居高臨下之局勢中、以四十五對二十七殺勝南星、昨賽結果及情形如下、</p>

<p>甲組賽第一幕、靑光與滬江、球藝不相上下、上半時賽　來勢均力敵、比數相差常在數分間、成十九對十五之比、靑光佔先、下半時中、青光絡聯有致、韓仁祥陸大振在角底遙射、連連投中、滬江益形不支、打至三十叫對二十時、童小培四决犯規出塲、因後衛乏人、僅以叫人迎戰、滬江略見活躍、成四十五對三十一後、譚　譁父繼之罰出、是時尙餘二分鐘、靑光以三人支持殘局、結果以四十七對三十六獲勝、</p>
<p>暨南勝南星</p>
<p>曁南絡美妙、投藍準確、南星遠非其敵、局勢相差逾半、曁南獲得十六分時、南星始由鍾士模遠射開紀錄，上半時成三十四對八、下半時暨南以後備軍出塲、局勢始見接近、追成二十對三十七後、曁南正式隊員登塲、南星又形不支、最後結果為四十五對二廿七之比、</p>

<h3>小男兒　（一）（三）（一）</h3>
<p>— Louisa　M.Alcott原著　鄭曉滄譯</p>
<p>『有一次我有一　新鞋子，要想出出風頭；所以，雖然母親盼咐我不可離開那家門口的園庭，我還是跑走了，整天蕩來蕩去。那原是在城裹，我自己也不知道怎麼會沒有給車子輾過。我自已還很以爲得意。起初我在公園裏和幾隻狗玩要，後來在河裏和幾個不相識的童子玩小船，中餐時同一個紅頭毛乞丐姑娘吃些　魚和番薯，最後他們找得我的時候，我卻是熟睡在一家的門階沿上，我的臂膀倒是圍着一隻大狗。這已經是深夜了，我髒得如小猪玀一般，一雙新鞋已不成個校子——我那天走得大多了！』</p>
<p>『多麼有趣！』南恩喊着，看去已凖備要自己去試一番呢。</p>
<p>『第二天郤並不有趣了，』蜀夫人說時，自己在留神不要使她的眼色裏稍露一對於兒時的嬉要，猶存有多少的留戀。</p>
<p>『你母親打了你沒有！』好奇的南恩問題。</p>
<p>『他只打過我一次，就在那一次她還求我寬恕，要不然我想我總不會放過那件事的，因爲這太傷我的感情了。』</p>
<p>『爲什麼她求你寬恕？——我的父親就沒有。』</p>
<p>『因爲她打了我之後，我旋轉身子說道：『你自己的脾氣不好了。你自己也得受打的。』她朝我一看，忽然她的怒氣都已全消，於是她似羞愧地說道，「你不錯，蜀，我是發怒了；我自己先沒有給你一個好榜樣，那末我怎可以罰你發怒？饒恕了我，寶，讓我們看怎樣可以更加好好地互相輔助着。」我從沒忘記這一件事，這給我的好處過於十次的捧打。』</p>

<h3>聖誕節的一件禮物</h3>
<p>— 瘦秋</p>
<p>小朋友們，這一年一次的耶穌聖誕，又降臨了！我知道你們在聖誕節的夜裏，會期望聖誕老人贈給你們的贈品。但這是不可能的。因為聖誕老人决不會降臨到你們的家裏呀！所以你們期望的結果，一定會失望的。</p>
<p>不過，小朋友們，你們不必灰心，現在我來代表聖誕老人，送給你們一件非常名貴的贈品。這贈品是什麽呢？那就是「勤」「儉」兩字。一個人如果能夠勤於讀書：勤於作事，那他的前途，一定是極有希望的。至於「儉」字呢？是指的儉樸，一個人能夠儉樸，對於物價上，就能夠知足，就能夠不生攘奪，貪污之念了！所以古人有「儉以養廉」的名言。</p>
<p>勤儉是富貴的根本，富是由儉字上得來的；貴是由勤字上得來的；所以一家勤儉，則一家富足；一國勤儉，就一國富足；但是勤儉的習慣，是由小時候養成的，所以我很希望小朋友們也從小時候養成勤儉的習慣。</p>
<h3>移賀年費助賑</h3>
<p>— 莎菲</p>
<p>時光過得眞快！二十四年度的一本日歷祗剩得最後的幾頁了。是的，那個專門騙我們金錢的外國老老頭又在巿塲上活動起來了。小朋友！你們大家都知道，這景象該是新的二十五年度快要來的時候哪。</p>
<p>一年一度的常年舊規——寄賀年片，又得在這歲暮的時候開始了，小朋友！在這幾天中也許你們是正在忙著為了賀年片而費去了好多的時間和金錢呢。不錯，這雖然是禮節，但是，我們是得仔細地想一想，在這年頭兒是否允許我們恭賀得起來？</p>
<p>同時我們再得這末的想一想，我們是吃得飽飽的，穿得暖暖的。可是，一般災區裏的受難的同胞呢，他們是飢寒交迫地嗷嗷待哺着正等待着人們的救援呢！當然，我們小朋友也該盡一份義務。得啦，現在我們就把寄賀年片的費用節省下來，去移賑災民吧！這，我想，小朋友們大家都願意做的吧？</p>
<h3>植物的冬天生活</h3>
<p>— 眞</p>
<p>天氣漸漸的冷了，樹上的葉兒一片一片的飄下，於是敏兒的身上已加多了不少的衣服。一天他心中在想着：「天冷了，我們都穿厚衣服了，而樹上的葉子一片一片的飄下來，難道它們不怕冷嗎？」</p>
<p>「哥哥，樹木一到冬天，　要落葉？這是甚麽道理？」</p>
<p>「落葉的樹一到了冬天，因為它們所受的太陽光不足，水濕不够，於是樹葉便漸漸枯黃，而一片一片的落下，因此製造食物的機關沒有了。發散作用，同化作用也就停止，根部的噅收水分的作用也就完全停止，所以生機斷絕，變成了冬眠的狀態。這個現狀，大槪因為冬天日光熱减少，葉身裏的葉綠素不再吸收空氣中的碳養氣，一方面因為水濕减少，根部的吸收作用也漸衰弱，不能補充水分，所以停止發散水分，使樹枝和樹幹內部，不致枯乾，一方面又因為樹葉的生活時期，也有一定的限度，過了限度，就不能生存，所以到了這個時候，葉柄的基部，發生了離層。離層外周圍有一道輪綫。這離懐面的細胞枯死，所以一經風吹了以後，樹葉就飄下來了。」</p>
<p>「哥哥，那麽有些樹，到了冬天，仍不落葉，這又是什麽道理？」</p>
<p>「這不落葉的樹，叫做常綠樹，它們在冬天，能够耐寒，陽光雖然不强，也能生長，所以仍舊照常發育，不過比溫暖的時候生長得慢些。但是它的樹葉，也不是常常留在樹上的，到了一定的期限，也要脫落，不過一方面在脫落　的樹葉，一方面新的樹葉也在長大，所以覺得葉色蒼翠，一年四季不會凋謝的了。」</p>
<h3>値得介紹的兒童玩具</h3>
<p>— 巴玲</p>
<p>誰都知道，兒童的天性，是非常好奇而活動的，所以玩具之於兒童，實在是他們唯一的恩物。每個兒童的歡喜玩具，正和他們的歡喜零食一般的重要，可惜年來外貨玩具的進口，日益激增，使我們中國的金錢，為購置兒童玩具而流出國外的，為數很多，然海關的統計，去年一年中的外貨玩具進口額，竟逹六百萬元之巨，試問這是一個多麽驚人的統計？這是一個多麽駭人聽聞的數目？若不謀所以補救的方法，那末，金錢的外溢，實在是一個非常可怕的危機。</p>
<p>現在好了，我們中國的國貨工廠，也有自製的國貨玩具出世了，創製兒童玩具的工廠，是國內有名的實施科學管理法的康元製罐廠，據我所知，它們已經出品的鵝絨玩具，有象，狗，馬，猴子，鱷魚，蛙…等等十餘種，每種玩具，都有機械裝在裏面，所以機關一動，就能活動如生，煞是好看，而且售價很廉，普通的家庭，都有購買的能力。</p>
<p>當此學生國貨年將要結束的時候，我誠懇的介紹這幾種國貨的活動玩具給諸位可親可愛的兒童們，希望諸位小朋友，從今以後，應當多買國貨的玩具，替國家盡推銷國貨的責任，這樣，才對得起國家，對得起社會，同時，更對得起自己？</p>
<h3>手足要清潔</h3>
<p>— 珮瑜</p>
<p>經騐告訴我們，清潔是一種很有效騐的保護的身體和防禦疾病的方法·我們的身體要清潔，我們的手足也要清潔·因為有許多細菌和微生蟲專門做傳染各種疾病和破壞人類健康的工作。這種東西小得我們的肉眼不能看見，在顯微鏡下就可以看得清清楚楚了。它們見清潔最怕，所以我們就要利用清潔來打倒它們，滅除它們。</p>
<p>第一我們要養成一種簡便的健康習慣，就是清潔我們的手和足。我們在吃東西之前和大小便之後，一定要用肥皂擦清水洗，用藥水肥皂擦洗更好。手指手掌手背和手腕都要洗得乾凈，尤其是指甲；因為在這小小的地位裏，可以藏着千千萬萬的細菌微生蟲和其他污穢的東西。指甲不但要時時清潔，而且要常常剪短，使這種害人生病的壞東西，不容易躱在裏面。</p>
<p>我們的足應該每天晚上臨睡的時候洗一次。洗足的水中可以放少許食鹽，在夏季裏不的溫度不妨比我們的體溫低些。　我們對於趾甲也要像指甲一般的注意，至少每星期修剪一次。在修剪的時候要當心，不可剪去得太多，最好趾甲與趾端平，剪得太多，容易使趾甲嵌入肉裏去，卽使不嵌入肉裏，趾端和鞋襪接觸也要生痛的。至於所穿的襪最好是羊毛或羊毛絨（俗稱開士米）做的，棉做的或絲與棉混合做的襪不大相宜，因為這種襪缺少伸縮性，有碍足的發育。</p>

<h3>梵啞鈴之話</h3>
<p>— 月祺</p>
<p>我的名字叫做梵啞鈴，</p>
<p>我是樂隊中的王后，是「絃樂」貴族中的最響亮者。有時我唱的是最高音，但有時我也充助手。在絃樂中，「第一」多於「第二」。這是和人間生活不同的。</p>
<p>我的家人們誇口說，我是從「射神」愛普羅的銀弓誕生的，但也有人低語說，七絃琴是我的祖先之一！這些都不管，我倒非常忠實：人給予我什麽情緒，我就把它表現出來。</p>
<p>我最早出風頭，是在意大利。時候是在十七世紀，那時候歌劇中需要一種陪襯高音的「最高音拉琴」。　不久就有人發見：我的音調是這麽美麗，至於模擬人聲的偉大音樂沒有我便不成章。我的木頭給仔細地挑選，烘藏；我的絃索給優雅地排置；用最上等的油漆使我的身體發光；那時候，我眞是再快活也沒有了。</p>
<p>於是，在一個樂師的手中，我能够把各式各樣的情緒表現出來——如水銀瀉地一般的流利而連續的旋律，斷斷續續的跳舞樂曲，震動的顫音，華麗的指彈音，使人心跳的擺音，如泣如訴的滑奏，柔和的諧音，及其他給予人們的印象。</p>
<p>不過。為使人的表現逹於至上起見，我必須要有一張精美的弓身。是的，我特別注意我的弓身，正和一個美麗的小姑娘特別注意她的漂亮的服裝相同。</p>

<h3>一張立體的賀年片</h3>
<p>— 董遜</p>
<p>一年過去一年來，舊年過去，中華民國二十五年的新年快又來了！當然地，你的朋友們寄了賀年片給你，你不能不回寄的，可是你若是到店裏去買賀年片，價廉的就不美觀，美觀的價錢又很昂貴，現在我告訴你做一張立體賀年片方法，所費的時候並不多，所耗的費用也很少，式樣旣美觀，又極新穎，若是把它寄給朋友，他們一定是非常歡迎的！</p>
<p>製法：</p>
<p>先以圖畫紙一張，照甲圖剪成「一」「二」兩片（其大小可依比例而定），在「一」上穿一小孔，別剪一烟突「三」插於孔中，然後將「一」，「二」用膠水粘合·「一」可以不施色彩，「二」之墻壁施以黃色或藍色，門上施以較淡之黃色或藍色，窗為白色或挖空而在背面貼以透明之薄紙，好像小的玻璃窗。</p>
<p>別以厚硬圖畫紙，裁成長方形，然後依戊圖上之「四」裁摺而將乙用膠水貼於其上。此外再採取有刺之柏枝三，四枝，插於屋傍，每邊兩校，如戊圖全部。柏枝之下部須長（如丙圖），以便插入圖畫紙中（如丁圖）。</p>
<p>特工程做至戊圖部份後，須另備厚硬的圖畫紙一張，上部墜以天青或淡藍色—白色亦可，並將「恭賀新禧，敬祝進步……某某敬賀。某某鞠躬……」等字據用紅色先行寫好，然後將戊貼於其上，如庚圖；此時候大部工程已完竣，禰剩下一部很重要的了，這部重要工作就是「上雪」，所謂「上雪」就是一面用小刀把粉筆刮成細白的粉末子，一方面把屋子的頂面，小樹之上以及地面上都過塗以膠水（不要太濃厚），然後將粉筆末子散在上面，使之粘住，好條雪花般落在屋上，樹上，地上，不過膠水須塗得均勻否則一滴一滴地，粉筆帕米爾都膠成一塊一塊的了！大紙片庚之後，另以厚硬紙片依己圖而剪一架子，以膠水粘於其上，以便支持而可站立在書桌或其他的東西之上。這樣：工作就完成了！</p>
<p>立體的賀年片做成以後，若是要用郵寄的話，那末另外還須預備一隻立體的盒子，否則就親自送去也可以的。</p>
<p>最後，我還要告訴諸位小朋友幾句話，就是我所講的方法，祇是一個很簡單的，希望小朋友們能以它為啟示，再創造幾張　美麗，更繁複的！同時我更希望在明年的新年，能給諸位做一張活動的賀年片！</p>

<h3>義狗傳（二）</h3>
<p>— 心靑</p>
<p>他們倆都很窮，—非常的窮，往往有好多天沒有東西吃。他們實在沒有吃飽的機會，要是他們能够舒舒服服的吃一飽時，那就立刻好似走進天堂去了。但那老人對於這孩子是很溫和很良善的，而這孩子也是清秀誠實，天性很溫柔的；他們只要得到一些面包屑或幾片菜葉，那就快樂的什麽似的，再也無所求於天地間了。委實說只要柏德希和他們常在一起，苦苦的度日，他們也就心滿意足，萬一沒有了柏德希正不知道該怎麽辦呢？</p>
<p>因為柏德希是他們生命的全部；是他們的寶庫和穀倉；是的金鑛和富源；是他們的國務卿和掙麺包者；是他們的唯一的慰安和好友。柏德希要是死了或離開了他們，那麽他們只得躺下來一同死去。柏德希是他們祖孫二人的手和脚；身體和頭腦；總之，柏得希就是他們的性命，也就是他們的靈魂。</p>
<p>因為老達士是太老了，并且是一個有殘疾的人；南洛又是一個小小的孩子，而柏得希卻是他們的一頭忠義而壯健的狗。</p>
<p>它是一頭法蘭特斯種的狗，—黃色的皮，挺大的頭和四肢，狼一般的豎直着的耳朵，腿和脚很強勁有力，分明是從很多年的苦役中磨練出來的。</p>
<p>柏德希父母，原來兩頭做慣了苦工的狗。一輩子在那法蘭特斯的高低不平的路上往來奔走着做那辛苦疲乏的工作。柏得希生下來時，就受了它父母的遺傳，只知道替人類做着苦工，它受足了咒罵，挨够了鞭打，它一切只能忍耐。爲甚麽呢？因為還是一個耶教國，而它不過是一頭狗罷了。</p>
<p>它自出世以後還沒有長足，先就飽嘗了皮圈和木車的苦味，整日的拉着車子供人奔走·它還沒有長到十三個月，就做了一個金屬物商人的私有物，慣常的從南方跑到北方；從綠海奔上青山。因為它太小之故，人家是賤賣給這個商人的。</p>
<p>這商人是一個醉漢和惡徒柏德希　天天過着地獄中的生活。它的主人刁惡性成，從來不顧它的死活，往往把許多金屬的瓶　罐頭，裝滿了他的車子，給柏德希沒命的拉去，而他目已卻搖擺着他那胖大的身體，懶散地在一旁踱着，口中抽着那黑色的烟斗，一路上每經過一家酒店或咖啡店，就得停下來吃喝。</p>
<p>可是柏得希無論是幸與不幸，它終於是一頭强有力的狗，因為它出身於一個鐵一般堅強的種族，挨得起種種暴虐的待遇；所以它並沒有死，還是在那不斷的打罵飢渴的虐政下掙扎着，延長它那苦痛的生命。</p>

<h3>今後言論界應有的趨向</h3>
<p>— 華林</p>
<p>社會的光明，往往先要靠多數剛正不阿的輿論界中人將其「黑暗面」磨削去了，然後那所謂「光明」才會透出一點消息來，一直到「光徹寰宇」「光芒萬丈」的境界。然而在此舉世物慾薰張的時候，人們大多只能為利己着想？若能不損他人以利自己，已可稱得社會上的淸風亮節之士，什麼大衆福利，固早已少人聞問了。於是世事無是非，黑白常混淆。縱觀今日的政治局面，經濟狀况，人民生活，整個社會的外表與內層，其不健全之所在，其黑暗勢力之籠罩，固凡有識老均能知之，且均能道之。然則誰負擊破「黑暗」，追求「光明」的責任呢？我以為至少言論界應盡」部分的責任，特別是在目前「言論自由」得稍稍「恢復」的時期中，牠的責任更其重大。</p>
<p>誰都知道新聞記者是無冕帝王，輿論的權威，他的力量足以鎭攝黑暗角中的魍魑，然亦惟有眞能「大公無我」，不計「私人利害」，不畏「强力制裁」者，然後可以與談輿論的權威，也惟有像易卜生的名著「國民公敵」裏所吿訴我們的那個永遠不為威力所屈的醫生，才是我們今日建設輿論的時期中所需要的人物。凡當其局者，執迷於一時，其結果固可損害大衆的利益，然輿論若不指示其迷途，則輿論界的罪過實有更甚於當局者。蓋明知之，而故縱之，於個人失責事小，於社會國家的影響則大。</p>
<p>其决，輿論不僅須負「破壞」的責任，同時也須負起「建設」的責任。輿論若為了「建設」而從事於「破壞」，則牠仍然不愧為「建設的輿論」。對於已發生或已發現的事伴加以詳細批判，解說其產生原因，研究其歷史，環境，並推證其結果，固是言論老的本分，然而言論者主要的任務却在先憑其眞知灼見，認淸事件的是非得失，或則運用輿論的威力去壓迫牠，使之防患於「未然」，或則運用輿論的威力去促進牠，使之得見於實現。此種建設性盼獻議，方為建設的輿論之最高目標。</p>

<h3>講武學生</h3>
<p>— 高邦</p>
<p>在十多年以前，我為了想穿一套軍服和掛一條武裝帶，趾高氣揚地做個軍官，曾投入一個講武學校肄業。</p>
<p>「駱駝趙」，便是在那時候做了我們的隊長。他個子長得並不算矮，可是一個癩蝦蟆似的小肚子向前挺着，背脊却又相反地朝天拱起來，這樣，從後面看去，那顆腦袋便像嵌在胸脯上而似的。而「駱駝趙」這個綽號也就因此出名了。</p>
<p>「駱駝」的一張臉，據說從前倒長得有紅有白，煞是漂亮，但後來因為他吃伙食不肯讓人，便不幸得了胃病，所以，我看他的臉簡直是瘦得像猴子似的，兩片嘴唇僅够包住牙齒的一半，說話時嘴唇和牙齒凑合起來活像一隻佛手。因此，每逢上級長官來檢閱時，我們一見他那張佛手似的嘴，就忍不住地要笑了。</p>
<p>「笑什麼？堂堂的一個軍人，愛笑？婦人孩子才愛笑咧！誰再笑？就給他吃板子！」他見了我們笑，便嘮嘮叨叨來上這麼一套；但眞的拿起板子來打，那也是常有的事。</p>
<p>他最喜歡做的事是訓話；但我們一聽到他要訓話，各人的頭就痛起來。他訓起話來，說來說去總是幾句老調。我們祇要翻開値星日記簿上的「隊長訓話記要」來一看，就知道他所說的就祇有這上而的那麼幾條：一，要絕對服從，二，要禮節周到，三，要內務整潔，四，要忍苦耐勞，五要鍛煉身體，六，……</p>
<p>在野外出操的時候，如果見有瞧熱鬧的人在傍邊，那他又非得來一次最嚴厲的訓話不可。他說時是那麼愈說愈有勁，假如你站立的姿式，為鬆懈一點，或是沒有十分注意他的設話，那他是會不客氣地當着許多人面前顯示他隊長的威風，趕到你面前來打兩下，或者用指揮刀在你背脊上敲一刀。</p>
<p>他的一副脾氣好像天生成就是專愛和我們為難的，每一個星期他至少要舉行兩决淸潔檢查和武器檢查。他來檢查時事先是不給人知道的，像貓兒捉老鼠那麼的窺伺着，等我們玩得正自高興的當兒，他就突然地跑了進來。手上帶着一雙白色的手套，一走進來便朝玻璃窗上一摸，瞇着兩隻老鼠眼盯着，如果白手套上有一點灰塵，那便該這房間裏値日的同學倒霉了。他不是把你喊過來，撳着耳朶叫你看，就是把那隻有灰塵的手套向你臉上一凑：</p>
<p>「嘿！擦得這麼乾凈的玻璃？好，「禁足」一星期！」</p>
<p>在檢查武器的時候，如果發現了槍膛裹有點油，或是槍子沒有退空，那他不是揍你幾十板，便是罰跪幾小時。</p>
<p>記得有一個星期裏，我們那一隊幾十個人中間，祇有兩個同學沒有被罰。</p>
<p>我在講武學校裏的住了一年多，以後我應友人之聘，在他那裏担任團長之職，從那時起，便不再聽到關於駱駝趙的消息了。</p>

<p>一說到人與人的關係，我們就很容易想起朋友，親戚，夫婦，兄弟，姊妹等等的表明這關係的名詞。若要問朋友，親戚，夫婦等關係是怎樣發生的，那一般的回答也很簡單：如甲與乙之成為朋友，乃是由於他們是鄰居或是同學同事而發生的，再不然便是由於他們在某一偶然的機緣下相識而結成朋友的；至於親戚，夫婦等關係，當然是以男女的婚姻為媒介而發生的，說得更通俗一點，便是以生殖器為媒介而發生的。但是所謂朋友，親戚，夫婦等關係，乃是人間的表面的關係；而且像上面那樣的對於這些關係之解答也是極表面的，人人都曉得，用不着我們來研究。我們知道，人是羣居的動物，他生活於社會中，所謂人與人的關係，乃是指人與人的社會關係而說的；若人與人沒有這種社會關係，則社會便無由組成，因而人類也就不會存在，所謂朋友，夫婦，親戚等關係便更無從發生了。我們所要在這裏說的，便是人與人的根本關係，即社會關係是怎樣發生的。</p>
<p>布氏會說：「社會是由個人組織而成，這是毫無疑義的。沒有個人便沒有社會——這也不待詳說就已經很明白了。可是應當切記，社會决不是許多個人單純的堆積，人的總數，將張三李四許多人相加起來就是社會。我們已經知道，社會是一個現實的總和，「系統」；我們又知道，在社會裏許多個人與個人之間有極錯綜的千差萬別的相互動作的複雜的大網存在着。這是為什麼呢？這就是說，社會是一個整體，大於各部分相加之總數，即社會並不是由各部分相加起來的總數。不淪生物的機體或死物的機械，凡是各種各式的系統，其內部各分子之間都有相互動作的聯繫。譬如某種機器或一個簡單的錶，我們把牠各種構成部分一件一件的拆開來，再把那些拆開的部分放在一堆，——這就是牠們的總數。但這已經不是機器，不是錶了。為什麼？因為在這裏沒有一定的聯繫，即形成這一機械的各構成部分之間已經失去了一定的相互動作。何以這些構成部分能成為一部機械的總體的各部分呢？因為有共中一定的配置。在社會裏亦是如此。社會是人組織而成的。但是如果這些人在勞動過程中於一定的時間沒有佔得一定的位置，如果這些人之間不曾先有勞動的聯繫，那時社會也就無從存在了。」</p>
<p>在這段話中是表明了人類依勞動的聯繫而組成社會；也就是說人與人的社會關係是依勞動而發生的；勞動是人與人發生社會關係的基本條件。</p>
<p>事實上，不管你願意不願意，只要是你還生活於社會中</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>，你都非要與一切社會人發生或多或少的關係不可。你要穿衣喫飯，就得到要與地主農民織工和紗廠布廠等的老闆乃至運輸販賣的商人發生關係；你要住房子，就要與建築師工人和地產公司等等發生關係；甚至你要大小广，也得與倒馬桶的人發生關係（有抽水馬桶者則是與另外的人發生關係），假使全上海倒馬桶的人都不工作，即倒馬桶的人都忽然不繼續原來與人倒馬桶的關係，你看那要不要命——但所謂務農，作工，經商乃至於倒馬桶，都是勞動，因之上述那些關係即使勞動關係，也是由勞動而產生的人與人的社會關係。</p>
<p>更具體一點說，社會是有嚴密的分工的，所有的社會人都要直接間接參加道社會的勞動的分工才能生存，即是所有的人都必然是生活在這勞動的分工合作的社會關係中的。農民雖然能務農，生產米麥等食物，但他們必須要工人製作農具才能工作，必須要土木石工修築房屋才能有住處，必須要織工織布才有衣穿，必須要商人運輸販賣才能取得一切生活上的必需品；同樣，其他的一切人羣或個人都必須要與社會的另一些人發生勞動關係才能生活。在「孟子」上曾經有位　自耕而食的許行，他牽領門徒到　勝國，好像屹然獨立於人類的勞動關係之外似的，實行自作自食，這看來是多麼的「清高」。但在實際上他也並不是生活在人類社會的勞動的合工關係之　的。請看下面孟　與崇拜許行者的一段有趣的對話吧</p>
<p>「孟子曰：許子必種　而後食乎？曰，然；許子必織布而　衣乎？曰，否許子衣褐；許子　乎？曰，冠；　冠？曰，冠　；曰，　　　　？　，否，以粟易之；曰，許子　為不自織？曰，害於耕；曰，許子以釜　　，以鐵耕乎？曰，然；自為之與？曰，否，以粟易之。．．．．．．」</p>
<p>有此可見無論怎樣「清高」「能幹」的人，都必然是生活於人與人的社會關係中的；而構成這個關係的乃是人類的勞動的分工。</p>
<p>在我們的社會中，因為勞動技術的進步，社會的文明更　等，所以人與人的社會關係是更複雜，更　大了。但這也是從人類的勞動的分工過程中產生出來的。如火車輪船飛機電報的無線電之出現，使所有地球上的國家都可以交換物品，互通消息，使所有地球上的人都發生了密切的關係，但所謂火車輪船等乃是人類勞動的　物，火車輪船等之運輸貨物與　　線電等之傳達意見和消息，也要全靠人類的勞動，所以　　　　　目前世　　　　交通往來，人類關係的範圍之擴大，乃是依靠人類的勞動的。同時，由於勞動技術的進步，人類關係的擴大，不僅是個人不能獨立生活於社會的勞動關係之外，就是一個國家也不能單獨存在於國際關係之外。很顯然的事實，如國聯之對意實行經濟封鎖，就已經夠使意大利喫苦了，最近　要實行對牠封鎖油煤，這更使意人驚惶憤怒；但這還不算，假若世界各國都一齊與牠斷絕一切關係，那意大利這個國家便有不能維持的危險。這是什麽道理呢？最後的答復仍是因為動技術的進步，產業的發展，已經使全世界人發生了密切的關係，已經把世界打成了一片，任何人乃至任何國家都不能獨立存在於這一整個關係之外。</p>
<p>自然，我們不是說除勞動關係之外，其他一切關係都絕對不存在。事實上，如人類因思想的相同而結成同道的關係，因思想性情之能調和而結成朋友的關係，……，都是我們所常見的。但我們依然要堅決地說，這些關係都是勞動關係的附屬物。首先，所謂思想性情的相同並不是天生成的，而是人們的勞動生活的產物。必須要勞動生活或生活環境相類似者，其思想和性情才能類似，因而才能結成同道或朋友；否則便不能。煤油大王與黃包車夫，彼此的勞動關係相衝突，生活環境不相同，他們便不能有類似的思想和性情，從而也不能做同道和朋友。這是誰也無法否認的事實。復次，人類若不勞動，不發生勞動關係，根本就不能生存，人類社會也根本不能存在，因之說明同道關係，朋友關係乃至夫婦關係便都不會發生了。依據這個理由，我們還是要說人與人的關係在最後是由勞動發生的</p>
<p>因為人與人的關係式由勞動發生的，人不能獨立生存於勞動關係之外，所以一切人間的現象都與我們有不可分離的關係，我們都當努力去理解。如美國的收買白銀，意阿開戰，對於中國的金融和工商業以及我們的生活都有極大的關係，我們都當予以深切的注意。此外對於其他一切大小的社會現象也當如此。</p>
<p>言論</p>
<h3>關於「言論自由」</h3>
<p>— 仲魯</p>
<p>在這次六中全會和五全大會中，曾有「恢復言論自由」的決議，這比較起來未「恢復」的時期來，的確要好些。然而我們希望所謂「言論自由」是真正的「言論自由」，不是令人難於猜想的「依法律」和「正當」之下的「言論自由」；同時，這種真正的「言論自由」，還應該馬上兌現，因為這是目前全中國人民急於要求實際解決的問題，不是一個決議案和一紙公文所能了事的。</p>
<p>現在，因為「國難」的日益嚴重，所以朝野上下都充滿了「精誠團結，共赴國難」的呼聲。這裏的「精誠團結」，其意義，不消說是全國人民自上而下或自下至上的「精誠團結」；因為只有全國人民上下一心地團結起來，才能夠抵禦強敵，挽救危亡。但是，要全國人民一致團結起來「共赴國難」，至少總當讓一般國民自由發表其意見，總當讓她們知道目前國內外的一切情形如何，總當讓她們自由討論挽救危亡的辦法，如果一面喊着「精誠團結」，另一面又不讓有意見的國民自由發表其意見，又不讓不知道目前國內外一切情形的人民知道這些，那所謂精誠團結，結果恐怕還是空的。因為我們認為至少在目前「國難」嚴重時期，應讓每一個國民多有機會明白自己的責任，應准許他們自由地放表其意見，貢獻其能力，以共同救國和自救。</p>
<p>同時，真正的「言論自由」的「恢復」，還可以增強我們外交力量，還可以增高我民族在國際上的地位。因為如果我全國人民都能自由地發表意見，那便可以表現出我國民氣的高揚，表現出一般國民的愛國和愛自己的精神，使奸徒們無法偽造民意去做叛逆的勾當，使侵略者也不敢公然向我全國人民進攻。</p>
<p>自然，所謂「言論自由」，應當有相當限制。但我們以為在目前情形下，這個限制是當以國家民族及一般國民的利益為依據。具體言之，即是像殷逆及其同僚和奴才們的荒謬言論，與夫那些向敵人討好獻媚的言論，都當絕對限制，絕對禁止；此外如研究一切新舊學術，新舊思想的言論，稱讚或批評現實社會的言論，與夫對內政外交等等問題發表意見的言論，都應當給與絕對的自由，因為要這樣能顯出全國人民的各種意見究竟誰是誰非，才能促進我們的國家，民族，社會和文化向前發展。我們相信，只要是自己並不以其思想為錯誤的人，只要是自己並不以其必為全國國民所唾棄的人，必然不致反對這種絕對的言論自由，因為真理是不怕絕對自由的討論的。</p>
<p>最近國府已通令切實保障輿論，我們希望如上述那樣的真正絕對的言論自由能馬上實現；為了要使這一希望成為現實，我們更盼望一切出版家，著作家，各書局和各報章雜誌的編輯人，與夫朝野上下的一般國民，在目前都來特別注意這個問題，並以各種有效的辦法來解決這個問題。</p>
<p>常識</p>
<h3>火在人類史上的作用</h3>
<p>— 從魯</p>
<p>火，這是野蠻人類在開始知道利用摩擦生熱的經驗中，逐漸完成的許多偉大發明品之一。中國的故事　有燧人氏鑽木取火，一切原始的野蠻民族也都知道　用以石擊石的方法取火，可見　　　石互相摩擦打擊，使它發生高熱而生活，這是原始人類共同習知了的事情。固然，在那時的人類是盲目的利用着摩擦生熱的物理法則而進　生產，因此他們並不懂得這就是一種科學的原理，也不知道它是科學的發現與科學的生產活動之一。但是，無論如何，火的發現，客觀上是成為人類的物理科學發達中的科學知識之一大的進步，所以火的發現就在自然科學史中不能不佔一個相當的地位。因為它表明這一物理法則已為人類經驗到了，而且已經能夠利用這種法則了。</p>
<p>火的發明，在人類的進化上，它具有極其偉大的意義，這是我們所要特別申述的一點。首先我們就可以看見火的發明對於人類自己的機體進化上發生影響。因為在沒有火以前，人類對於他的食品之享受，由於有許多不易分裂和切碎的食物，是必須要具有易於分裂和切斷食物的利齒，才能將食物吞食得了。這正如肉食動物虎，豹，犬，貓，他們爲了便於裂食肉類起見，便不能不具有銳齒，而食草動物如馬，牛，羊，牠們則為了便於切斷和咀嚼植物起見，也就不能不具有銳齒一樣。但是，自從發明了火以後，一切不易分裂和咀嚼的食物，都可以先行烹熟，使之便於吞食，於是人類的齒的作用便減低了，所以人類並不需要具有肉食動物的銳齒即可以食肉，也不一定要具有食草動物那樣強的磨切咀嚼能力的鈍齒亦可以食植物，人齒和齒　雖都因此退化縮短了，可是它却反因有火的助力而更能食多方面的食物。在另一方面，火未發明以前，人類對於食物的消化也必須具有很強的消化能力，才能消化食物，但自火發明以後，食物預先要用火烹熟，使它成為半消化品，便易於消化了。如此，人類的消化器官也因着火的幫助而減少了牠的作用，具有相當的退化。</p>
<p>火的發明與人類的食物　類之擴張也有很大的關係，因為沒有火則齒與消化器官都得去適應一定的食物而生長，於是反把他們的作用限制了。一定的齒既只能適宜於食一定的食物，則食物的種類也因此受了限制，如像食肉動物不能食植物，便不能以植物為食料，食草動物不能食肉，便不以肉類為食料，都是很顯明的證據。只有人類，他在獲得了火的幫助以後，便能食一切可以營養他的食物，所以他的食料也才特別多而複雜起來，並且因此能夠獲得充分的眾多的養分去營養他，既使人類能日益進化聰明，也使他能有充分繁衍其種類的可能。因為食物的優劣是有關於體質之進步和智愚的，而食物品類之廣狹和多寡，則能影響到種族之生存的便利與否，於是也關係於其能否繁衍的問題了。</p>
<p>火的發明大概是以肉食需要為其最重要的推動力，但火一發明了也就是更加促進了食肉生活的發展，這種發展也同樣推進了漁獵與牧畜生產方式的擴張。所以恩格斯就以肉食生活的獲得出發點，說它「產生兩種大的結果：一為火底使用，以為動物底馴育。有了火就減縮了食物消化的過程，因為食物經過火底作用以後就成為半消化的物質了。有了馴育的動物，就會有經常的食物泉源，同時動物底乳料亦不下於肉底補益。這樣看來，火與馴育的動物不啻為人類打開了一條解放與進步的大道。」</p>
<p>火在烹食上固然有很重要的意義，可是在禦寒取暖上同樣是極其重要的。在冰天雪地裏，特別是在寒帶地域，若沒有火可以取煖，人的生存是比較困難的。所以他的作用縱然嚴格地說來不如衣服的發明更能普通地禦寒，但它亦同樣為寒帶居民家居和過夜的不可少的東西，如果沒有火，在寒帶地方的人類便不易生存與繁殖的。有了火，對於人類生存與居住的地域至少是可以部份地擴大，人類也才以此有自由遷徙和居住於嚴寒地帶的可能。</p>
<p>火的發明對於人類生產的發達盡着最偉大的作用，這也是不可否認的。因為在原始人類最初就是利用火來作為工業生產的重要工具。當金屬用器尚未發明時，石器的掘洞斷物的能力是很有限的，砍伐大樹和造船都非利用火不可。野蠻人即以火燒伐大樹，亦以火稍數成穴製成獨木舟，火可以說是製造原始的交通利器的唯一有力的生產手段。假使我們從生產工具的製造那種工業發達的觀點去看，那麼金屬的用具和農器，非用火來鍛煉金屬不可，用以盛水與糧食　物的精燒陶器，發達，也非用火來燒冶不可，火災這裏成為把石器時代的人類推進到金屬用器時代的人類的動力，而陶器的發達它也居有偉大的作用。</p>
<p>自然，說道由石器時代進到銅器乃至鐵器時代，這在農業的進步上也具有極其偉大的作用，因為農具的本質只有進到以金屬製造它時，才能是農業充分地發達。陶器既然在收藏種子和糧食上有很大的作用。因此陶器的發達也是又助於農業的發展的。然而冶金業與陶業的</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>進步既有關於火的發明，那麼火在農業的進步與發展中也是盡有極重要的作用的，這是很明白的事。</p>
<p>火在它的發明上既要經過很長期的和很困難的經歷與經驗，而它的功用又如此的偉大，所以野蠻人通常都把它視為最寶貴最神聖的東西，還把牠嚴加保管並分出保管它的專門責任者來。因此，這一責任就落到婦女身上，成為男女的原始分工之一。火在原始時代是很稀少而難得的，所以原始的家族聚會起來都以一個火種為中心，保存火的　成為他們集合的中心，而這一聚居的氏族往往以火的興滅為其命運所　，火以此便被當做神聖崇拜，保管火的婦女在神話中也被想像為女神。赫士梯臣在古代就成為護火人的女神之名，在她的廟中火是永遠不滅的，別的廟中火如果滅了，也到得她那裏去取。盜取聖火是罪惡，要受罰，迎取聖火也有一定的宗教典禮。羅馬人的聖火就保存至千年不滅，甚至要選擇望族的貞女去護火而永不出嫁，「聖火不滅，羅馬不亡」已成為他們當時的普遍信條，這也是證明古人是如何重視和崇拜火了。中國人每家都有　神，廟宇中也有所謂火神都是同樣的風俗。火之所以被人崇拜至此，當由於其有推進人類進步的偉大作用啊！</p>
<p>書報介紹</p>
<h3>介紹「世界軍情畫報」</h3>
<p>— 敦如</p>
<p>——圖文出版社發行，每期定價三角——</p>
<p>因為世界形勢的日益緊張，全世界好像到處都可以聞到火藥氣和血腥氣，所以生活於現世界的人，只要不是「飽食終日，無所用心」的糊塗蟲，對於這緊張局勢下的時事都是非常留意的。在這留意中，他們不僅要看關於時事的文字的記載，而且還要想看時事中各種人物的活的　　和各種時事的具體的活的情況。如意阿開火的事件發生時，一般留心時事者自然都要看這事件的一切文字記載，但除此以外，他們還想看看阿比西尼亞的地勢，看看為國家民族獨立而戰得阿軍的陣容，看看慕索里尼，賴伐爾，艾登等人物的真面目，以及意圖飛機轟炸阿比西尼亞的殘酷的情形等等。因此，近來一般政治經濟和文化雜誌以及許多日報，除刊載時事解說的文章外，都特別刊載了一些關於時事的照片，地圖和漫畫。不消說，這對於一般讀者之理解時事，認識目前的緊張着的世界，是又很大幫助的。</p>
<p>最近出版的「世界軍情畫報」，更是特別刊載時事，尤其是軍事的寫真的。我們可以在這中間看到足以真實表現目前的重要時事的圖畫，使我們隊目前的世界變動有更深刻的印象和了解。該刊在其發刊詞中，曾表明了該刊所以發行之理由：</p>
<p>「各國對於軍備刻意求進，新兵器日有發明，軍隊機械化，毒氣死光將為未來大戰中之利器。各國舉行軍事操演，防空演習，已日有所聞。取鑑於人，藉以求進，覘他國攻取之方，謀自身防禦之策，軍人固當觀摩研應討，民眾亦備為常識。因感於文字記載之不易普遍與發生深切印象，　有世界軍情畫報之發刊。」</p>
<p>的確，像我們這樣一切都很落後的國家，像我們這樣半殖民地的人民，在各方面都當「取鑑於人」，以謀自身之進步和最後的出路。「世界軍情畫報」如果真的依據它的宗旨，努力貢獻一些新的科學發明的圖案，世界列強準備殺人的軍備實情，在列強角逐中的各重要地方的地勢，各弱小民族的被壓迫和其反抗精神的寫真等等，那它是必然要為一般讀者所愛護和推重的，用不着我們多說。</p>
<p>這畫報的創刊號是意阿戰爭特輯。在這中間，你可以看到表現意阿糾紛的歷史背景和英意衝突的各種圖畫，慕索里尼遠征東菲的氣概，意軍行動與阿國氣候的關係，也可以看到阿人抗敵的英勇精神，阿比西尼亞的詳細地圖，蘇伊士運河之重要，以及地中海上英意之軍事對立形勢。起重最有意義而且難於見到的，我以為是阿國人民全家從軍抗敵的幾幅寫真。單從這些全家抗敵的阿人的面部表情看來，我們就已經可以了解他們的內心，對於橫暴的侵略者是何等的憤怒，他們燃燒着的為民族獨立犧牲的情緒是何等的熱烈。此外，如關於蘇伊士運河的歷史，條約和現狀之文字與圖畫的解釋，關於阿比西尼亞的地理，歷史，氣候，出產與政治經濟之說明，對不熟悉菲洲情形的中國讀者，當然都是必要的。</p>
<p>自然，「世界軍情畫報」和別的刊物一樣，亦有缺陷。這里主要地我們可以指出兩點來：</p>
<p>第一，這畫報所表白的態度有點欠明白。它在發刊詞中說：「本刊之發刊，係應時勢之需求，有當聲明者：本報純為介紹事實，不參議論；取材皆有所本，文字僅具說明。事涉雙方，絕對居於中立地位；……」其實絕對中立的事情，人間就根本沒有。世界的一切事變之發生，都有其必然的原因和可能的結果，而且都有其現實的重大意義，只要我們要談這些事變，就不能不有一定的立場，否則就無從談起；就是單純的事實的介紹也是有立場的，否則也不能介紹。如意阿戰爭的事實的介紹，由阿比西尼亞介紹的與意大利介紹的就有不同，由英國或法國介紹的也各有其特點：這是為什麽呢？不消說是因為他們各自的立場不同。因此，我們希望「世界軍情畫報」不要幻想絕對中立，要明白站在正大的立場上來介紹一切，批判一切。當然，這正大的立場應該是進步的表同情於弱者的立場，因為如果「表同情於強暴的壓迫者，雖賢者亦會變成愚人」、因為要表同情於弱者才能得到多數人的共鳴，才能獲得多數的讀者。</p>
<p>第二，因為這畫報幻想絕對中立，所以時事解說的文字還覺太少。我以為畫報雖然應以圖畫為主，但也當盡量多刊載一些直接間接與圖畫有關係的文字；最好是有一半文字和一半圖畫。因為圖畫，特別是那些死板的攝影，只能給與我們以事實的印象，而抽象的文字則可充分表現出人對於事物的認識和批判的意見，從而便可使一般讀者對於事實有更明白更深刻的理解。圖畫的功效是在事實上給人以具體深切的印象，而文字的功能則是以抽象的分析給人以對事物的批判的理解。圖畫與文字對於我們都是各有其重要性的。但是，「世界軍情畫報」很少批判和解說時事的文字，有的只是「僅具說明」圖畫的簡短的文字：這不能不說是這畫報是太畫報化了所產生的一個缺點。</p>
<p>然而，不管怎樣，「世界軍情畫報」比起那　專與少奶奶和小姐們講裝飾的畫報來，比起那些印着「標準美人」的半裸體像的畫報來，比起那些幽默取笑的畫報來，總要好得多。所以我們在此仍要向一般讀者介紹：這畫報在目前緊張局面下出版是有其意義的，其內容當然也是值得一看的。</p>
<p>科學叢話</p>
<h3>不用土地的耕種法</h3>
<p>— 史庸</p>
<p>馬爾塞斯（T．R．Malthus）在十八世紀末發表了人口原理論，謂「人口增加速率依　幾何比例率，食物增加却依着算術的比例率」、他最大的論據是：「．．．．．．把世界人類無論拿什麽數目做標準，即如以一千萬為例，每二十五年之後，其數目將增加一倍，如一，二，四，十六，三二，六四，一二八。二五六，五一二等的比例，而同時食物增加的比例為一，三，四，五，六，七，八，九，十，等。所以在二百二十五年之後，人口與食物的比例為五一二與十；在三百年之後，人口與食物的比例為四０九六與十三；在二千年後，雖食物亦將大大的增加，然其與人口相差的區別，差不多是不可以數字計算了。．．．．．．這樣看來，可知人口增加的力量比地球產生人類生活資料的力量超過得多了。」這種理論的確實性雖已經許多學者嚴正的批判過，但那人口增加的趨勢却絕對是真理。自馬爾塞斯的時代至現在，不過經過了一百幾十年的時間，而這種事實却已漸給那原則所證明了，雖沒有馬氏所預期的那樣的嚴重。</p>
<p>人口增加既為事實，於是就引起了一般　　　武者把牠作為侵吞他人土地，劫掠他人食物的口實，且而他們還要這樣巧妙地說：「文明人來保管世界」</p>
<p>其實，人口過剩，是不是只有略取殖民地，以武力掠奪糧食這一條出路呢？不，不，決不！這只是一部分人類所榦出來的愚蠢舉動而已。</p>
<p>人間既有人口增加速率的事實，人類就同時應該想到如何使食物增加去適應人口的增加，去　充土地的使用。</p>
<p>以下接第五版</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>可惜這種科學家的任務又決不是一部分人類所能了解的，近接友人周承源君自東京來函，謂「不用土地也能種植東西」，他說：</p>
<p>『植物的生長祇要具有下列六個條件，　水，　空氣，　溫度，　養分，　光線，　生長有限物的不存在，所以雖是沒有土，我們祇要在這六條件的範圍內去想法子，不用土地種植東西也是可能的。</p>
<p>這個問題很早就有人研究過了，大約在距今二百卅六年前卽有水耕法的發明，所謂水耕法，便是以植物所需的營養成分溶入水中，做成一種人工植物培養液，而將植物種植其中，使其生長之一種方法。但因起初的試騐於經濟，時間，勞力的消耗都很大，也祇能當作一種學理的解釋而已。</p>
<p>最近，日本東京帝國大學助敎春日升新一郎，已將這方法試騐成功了。</p>
<p>春日氏於民國十八年開始進行研究，首先以水稻實騐，其結果與普通在土中種植者殆同，其後更把麥，胡瓜，茄子，烟草，豌豆，蠶豆，甘蔗，番茄，牽牛，菊花，黃瓜，西瓜，荔枝，大豆，大理花，西番蓮，天竺牡丹，南瓜，花生，芋艿等用水耕法培養，結果成績都很好，較之土耕法有過之而無不及，卽以前認為最困難的蘿蔔亦已試騐成功，今後的問題只是在如何應用了。</p>
<p>至於水耕法的施行方法，也很簡單，法以一盆，中置以石礫，將所欲種植的幼植物置於其中，注以人工培養液，此種培養液約三至七日換一次，如是約經十五次卽可結實成熟，不過因所種的植物不同，而所用的培養液亦有異，茲將春日氏試騐所用培養液之一種舉例如下：</p>
<p>蔬菜栽培用人工培養液（井水，自來水或蒸溜水一立升所含之量）</p>
<p>原料藥品　所含養分　分　量</p>
<p>硝酸铔　氮　〇·〇五七五</p>
<p>燐酸鉀　燐鉀·　〇·〇三八三</p>
<p>氯化鉀　氯·鉀·　〇·〇四三〇</p>
<p>硫酸鎂　硫鎂·　〇·〇一四五〇</p>
<p>硝酸鈣　氮·鈣·　〇·〇一一七〇</p>
<p>氮化第二鐵　鐵　〇·〇一—〇·〇四</p>
<p>稀鹽酸少許至該液之PH成五，五至七為止。</p>
<p>此種水耕法，據春日氏之計算，每盆所費之價値如下：</p>
<p>植物　德藥品價　合　日　金　名　（元）　（元）　普通肥料</p>
<p>蔬菜　〇·〇三八　〇·〇一〇　〇·〇二二</p>
<p>水稻　〇·〇一〇　〇·〇〇三　〇·〇〇六</p>
<p>由上表觀之，在經濟上是很便宜的。……」</p>
<p>我們希望春日氏的試騐能擴大其效能，將世間上的幾顆正在暴跳着的殘酷的心，給他鎭定一下，為人類减少一點痛苦，這是科學家普渡眾生的唯一責任。</p>

<p>— 濮漁</p>
<p>『喂！不要裝死像，究竟怎麽辦？』</p>
<p>老頭子遲疑了幾分鐘，纔躬起背兒逼近我面前，哽咽的說：</p>
<p>『柳主任，你還年青，請做點好事，——體念我沒有過錯，』他嘴在說話，手便打拱，『你說的數目，眞要逼死我老命！你看這……』他剛遞過賬簿，又打開錢櫃，『你看：——如果搜出二十元，願罰百倍，千倍！前兒的四百元，目前還在付利息，———五分利呵！嗯，嗯……』</p>
<p>這傢伙眞會裝死，竟吊下眼淚了。但是有什麽效用？這情形我見的太多。老實地說，我的性兒有點古怪：別人愈說窮，我總覺愈有錢。譬如老頭子的賬簿，確沒有幾筆進欵，錢櫃里祗有一堆銅子，可是我疑心那賬簿是假的，錢藏進地窖裏去了。眞的，這很可能，不要受騙！被我扼住了咽喉的人，休想透一口氣！（未完）</p>

<h3>Great Political Turbulence in Britain</h3>
<p>— Hua</p>
<p>Since the publication of the Hoare-Laval Pact to mediate the Italo-Ethiopian War, the reactions from all sides have been extremely strong. Within Britain, public opinion has largely expressed dissatisfaction, and even the left wing of the Conservative Party in the government has failed to understand it. The opposition parties have naturally launched relentless attacks. On the 18th of this month, Hoare suddenly resigned from his position as Foreign Secretary. On the 19th, the British House of Commons held a debate with explanatory speeches from Baldwin and Hoare. The Labour Party moved a motion of no confidence in the government, and Chamberlain and Dalton, representing the government party and the opposition party, respectively, engaged in fierce debates. This is the first major political turbulence since the formation of the new government after the general election. Hoare's resignation was originally a desperate move by the Baldwin cabinet to preserve its own position, but this move has indeed dealt a significant blow to the current Conservative Party government. The selection of a successor for the Foreign Secretary is a difficult problem. This political turbulence also has a significant impact on international diplomacy. The cooperation between Britain and France and the opposition between Britain and Italy are currently at an extremely delicate and complex juncture, and this juncture is also the key to determining the peace or war in Europe and dividing the future alignments. We will try to make a brief observation of the various relationships of this political turbulence.</p>
<p>The British general election this year was a strategy by the Conservative Party government to take advantage of the Italo-Ethiopian War to win domestic political victories under the slogan of unity against foreign aggression. The Italo-Ethiopian War threatened the traditional lifeline of the British Empire and brought the scourge of war in Europe closer. Under this crisis, the Conservative Party government was well-positioned to show a strong diplomatic strategy, from naval compromises with Germany, efforts to mediate the Italo-Ethiopian disputes, active efforts to court France, to the recent firm support for the League of Nations to launch sanctions against Italy. The Conservative Party government used these to flaunt before the British public its efforts to avoid war and ensure collective peace. The aging British imperialism is not like the young Italian imperialism; what it needs is peace, compromise, and the maintenance of the existing international balance of power. The British people naturally also love peace. In this way, the Conservative Party government was able to win the support of the general public by appealing to a policy of peace. However, how can the path to peace be achieved? This is a difficult problem that the British imperial authorities cannot solve.</p>
<p>Under the leadership of Baldwin and Hoare, the foreign policy of the British Empire regarding the peaceful resolution of the Italo-Ethiopian War has been wavering on two paths. One is secret negotiations between several related imperial powers to sacrifice the semi-colonial Abyssinia to achieve peace and compromise among them. The other is to use the League of Nations, the international peace organization, as the base, and to achieve peace through open mediation and even sanctions against aggressors based on the dignified League of Nations Covenant. Before the outbreak of the Italo-Ethiopian War this year, Eden and Hoare had resolutely used secret diplomatic negotiations, hoping to resolve the opposition between Britain and Italy by making Abyssinia a single sacrifice. France, because it wanted to please both Britain and Italy at the same time, also agreed to this kind of peace compromise based on sharing the spoils. However, Italy's desires were very great, and secret sharing did not succeed. The Italo-Ethiopian War finally broke out. Because the first path was impassable, Britain changed to the second path. This is the origin of Eden and Hoare's continuous release of many dignified speeches advocating support for collective peace and respect for the League of Nations Covenant. This dignified expression actually won the praise of international figures and also received the approval of the British public. However, the Conservative Party government's support for the League of Nations and collective peace is less of a sincerity than a strategy. The launch of economic sanctions is just a kind of pressure, and its role is to make Italy compromise and still accept the method of secret division of spoils. The so-called Hoare-Laval Pact, which almost completely carved up half of Abyssinia's territory to satisfy Italy's desires, is proof of this. However, when Mussolini was half pushing and half accepting, strong reactions had already occurred on the Abyssinian side, the Geneva side, and even in the British public and world opinion. The Conservative Party government's credibility suddenly plummeted, and as a result, Hoare could not but resign.</p>
<p>In order to consolidate the position of the current government, the successor to Hoare as the British Foreign Secretary must be a more prestigious and skillful figure from the Conservative Party, probably one of the Chamberlain brothers. But now we don't need to predict. In short, no matter what, the Conservative Party government must show a little more resolute support for the League of Nations and a tougher attitude towards Italy in order to regain the sympathy of the British public. Similarly, on the French side, the Laval government will also have to slightly restrain its tendency towards secret diplomacy in order to preserve its position. In this way, although the opposition of European imperialism still cannot be eased, the support of the people of various countries for the collective peace system has shown greater strength.</p>
<h3>Song Arrives at the Jicha Political Council to Discuss Internal Affairs with the Standing Committee</h3>
<p>Heads of Secretariat and Finance both attend office</p>
<p>North China customs and salt taxes remain unchanged</p>
<p>Procedures for the Hebei East problem are quite complicated</p>
<p>Beiping - Song Zheyuan arrived at the Jicha Political Committee at 8:00 AM on the 21st and discussed internal affairs with the Standing Committee members Gan Yitang and Liu Zhe, among others. Except for Pan Yugui, head of the Political Affairs Department who has not yet attended, the three acting heads of departments, Secretariat and Finance, have all gone to the office. It is reported that most of the staff in each department were transferred from the former military branch and other agencies. According to Guo Zhihan, head of the Finance Department, the Jicha Political Committee was organized according to the Central Government's order. The customs and salt taxes in North China will naturally still be handled according to the old system, without any changes. The Central Government previously subsidized North China's finances with more than one million yuan per month, and will continue to request that the full amount be allocated as before. As for other tax authorities, there will also be no changes. He will return to Chahar within a few days to handle matters in the Finance Department. Chahar Province's income depends on grain tax, but due to the recent poor harvest, the finances are quite difficult. (21st Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

The three acting heads of departments, Ge Dingyuan, Pan Yugui, and Guo Zhihan, all attended the office this morning, following the organizational outline and detailed rules of procedure for personnel deployment. It is expected that all work can be completed next week. Song also attended the office this morning. (21st Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Beiping - Guo Zhihan, head of the Finance Department of the Jicha Political Committee, said that there are no changes in the customs and salt tax system in North China. However, the Central Government has been subsidizing North China's finances by about one million yuan per month. In the future, it is hoped that the Central Government will continue to allocate funds as usual for construction. As for other tax revenues, this question will be how to deal with it. Because I am new to the job, everything is pending planning, and it is difficult to express an opinion. I will return to Chahar within a few days. (21st Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Nanjing - After the Hebei East rebellion, it was claimed that the Hebei East taxes and levies were intercepted. Last week, it was announced that Qinhuangdao and Changlu customs taxes were withheld, and remittances were prohibited. The Ministry of Finance ordered its subordinates to refuse, and ordered that taxes be reported through Tianjin Customs. According to a key official in the Ministry of Finance, customs and salt taxes have not been withheld so far. (21st Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Beiping - The procedures for the Hebei East problem are quite complicated. The authorities will propose opinions and suggest them to the highest authorities. (21st Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Beiping - Qian Xigeng, the special envoy of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stationed in Peiping, hosted a banquet for Song Zheyuan, Chairman of the Hebei Political Council, and all members at the Diplomatic Building the night before last. (21st Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>American Anti-War Association Opposes Bitterman's Defamatory Remarks Against Japan, However, the Government Does Not Wish to Express an Opinion at Present. Japanese Diplomatic Authorities Believe They Do Not Recognize the True Situation</h3>
<p>Washington: Senator Bitterman, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, yesterday withdrew the proposal for retaliatory tariffs. Although he did not criticize the Japanese government in the tariff investigation on the 19th, the American Anti-War Association has already requested the government to disavow the speech, otherwise, it will inevitably arouse opposition from national peace groups. President Roosevelt said that he had not yet read the speech, but Lee Philby, Secretary of the American Anti-War Association, expressed the association's opinion, saying that Senator Bitterman's arrogant speech is enough to endanger the security of the United States. Bitterman now wants to go to war with Japan. If this speech is not disavowed, the rumor that the government may resort to foreign wars to divert the people's attention from the domestic economic panic after winning the election next year will become more clear. If the Democratic Party wants to win the election next year without entering the vortex of the Asian war, it should announce to the country at this time, said Lee Philby. Lee Philby does not believe in the fear of Japanese aggression against the United States and ridiculed Bitterman's claim that Japan plans to conquer the world, and believes that Japan's attitude at the London Conference was sincere. Japan demands freedom of action in Asia but has no intention of attacking the United States. The United States is Japan's largest customer. Without American trade and raw materials, Japan would be isolated and helpless, he said. Lee Philby further warned that if Bitterman's speech is not disavowed, the association will politically oppose the government, because Bitterman is the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, that is, the speaker of the government's foreign policy in the Senate. (20th National Telegram)</p>
<p>Tokyo: Japanese diplomatic authorities dismissed Senator Bitterman, Chairman of the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee's anti-Japanese speech as a fallacy that does not recognize the true state of affairs in East Asia and holds the following view: At a time when the disarmament conference is being held, it is extremely unpleasant for the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee to speak so unrestrainedly in Japan. In short, Bitterman is a powerful member of the silver faction and had this extraordinarily insensible statement to win the favor of voters in silver-producing areas and the people of silver-using countries in China.

<h3>Borah Expresses Willingness to Be a Presidential Candidate, To Enable the Republican Party to Adopt a Broad and Liberal Platform</h3>
<p>Washington: Senator Borah stated today that he is willing to be a Republican presidential candidate. Borah claimed that his main goal is to enable the Republican Party to adopt a broad and liberal platform in the 1936 election. If those who advocate freedom believe that the delegates attending the National Republican Convention will elect him as a presidential candidate, which can be beneficial to liberalism, then he is willing to cooperate fully, he said. Looking at Borah's intention, when the National Republican Convention opens on June 9 next year, the formal remarks he will make about being willing to be a presidential candidate will not be outside of this. According to Borah's biographical history, it is based on independent thought and behavior, so in 1924, he refused to be Coolidge's Vice-Presidential candidate, and refused Harding's Senate Speaker's seat. However, he gladly accepted the position of Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. However, on important issues such as the US's relationship with the World Court, US-Soviet diplomatic relations, and debt clearance, he did not hesitate to fight against the leaders of his party, always maintaining the independence of his thoughts and actions. Borah is now seventy years old, serving in the Senate for nearly thirty years, is a lawyer and talented. His remarks against the League of Nations are most noted by the world. He has always opposed joining the League of Nations and does not approve of joining any alliances. He has recognized Soviet Russia from the beginning and opposes the United States occupying Haiti and Santo Domingo. In domestic affairs, Borah supports labor, advocates thrift, does not approve of high taxes, and does not advocate a large army. He opposes the soldier pension case and usually does not enjoy social life. When free, he reads books or rides horses in the suburbs and has no other habits such as alcohol or coffee.

<h3>Britain's Contact with Mediterranean Countries on Mutual Assistance, Several Countries Declare Will Carry Out</h3>
<p>Paris: According to the diplomatic correspondent of this agency, it was learned from responsible sources that the British government submitted inquiries to the Mediterranean countries, namely Spain, Turkey, Greece, Yugoslavia, and Romania, at the beginning of this month, stating that if the British Navy is attacked by the Italian Navy in the Mediterranean, can these countries assist Britain at sea? How Spain responded is not yet known here, but it is heard that the governments of the other four countries have all quickly replied, clearly stating that they are prepared to implement the mutual assistance measures contained in Article 16, Section 3 of the League of Nations Covenant.

(20th Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>London: The British government did not consider the replies of the countries satisfactory. When the House of Commons discussed foreign policy yesterday, the cabinet members, led by Eden, stated that the British government failed to obtain sufficient assistance to expand the sanctions policy because of this. Political figures believe that it is more convenient for the League of Nations to preside over the naval mutual assistance negotiations. (20th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>London: According to responsible sources, the British government will continue negotiations with the Mediterranean countries so that when the British Navy encounters an attack in the Mediterranean, it can be effectively assisted by these countries. Regarding this level, the British government began negotiations with the governments of Turkey, Greece, Yugoslavia, and Spain on the 8th of this month. The governments of these countries have successively submitted satisfactory replies. As for the purpose of future negotiations, it is to increase the efficiency of mutual assistance methods to resist aggression. As for Romania, although it is not a Mediterranean country, the British government also contacted it because it, Turkey, Greece, and Yugoslavia are all members of the Balkan Entente.

There is no hope of resurrection in the future. I think that all attempts to resolve disputes peacefully have come to an end at this time. Therefore, we must revert to the sanctions policy. If a member state of the League of Nations is attacked because of the implementation of sanctions, I believe that other member states can clearly express that they are ready to jointly assist," and "Therefore, in the next few years, improving national defense to guard against the unexpected is the government's inescapable task."

<h3>Fascist Party Core Cadres Only Express Support for Mussolini, Meeting Still Has No Resolution</h3>
<p>Rome: The core cadres of the Fascist Party met at 10:00 PM last night to discuss the Anglo-French peace plan and adjourned at 12:40 AM this morning without any resolution. Another meeting is set for January 18. Although London and other places regard the peace plan as dead, Rome still treats it as surviving. According to a responsible spokesperson, "We have not received a notice that the plan has been canceled." The plan was originally communicated to Rome through diplomatic channels. The Italian government's reply may be issued in the same way, so there is no need to announce it. A press release was issued after the Fascist Party's core cadre meeting, saying that Italy is determined to intensify its resistance to sanctions, and said, "It is now understood that after studying the Paris peace plan in detail on December 18, Britain now considers it invalid."</p>

A press release was issued afterward, saying, "This meeting discussed the international political situation after the British government abandoned the Laval-Hoare peace plan." It is understood that a motion was passed at the meeting, the general idea being that among the countries implementing sanctions, not only are the opinions mixed, but the phenomenon of going against each other is also more obvious. At this time, the Italian people are still firmly united to defend their due rights. Recently, the people of the country have been of one mind, donating their gold and silver to the country, which is the ironclad proof of the people's determination to resist and win. When this motion was passed, the representatives in the entire stadium cheered loudly. Afterward, it was decided that the soldiers on the front lines and the Blackshirts are the supreme need for Italian civilization, the future of Italy, and the security of Italy. The meeting should send a telegram to them to pay tribute for their hard work in fighting in East Africa. In addition, Volpi, the former Minister of Finance and Chairman of the Italian Industrial Associations, gave a speech, saying that although the sanctions have been implemented for a month, what all agricultural and industrial groups, representing the entire Italian nation, have shown to us is the great spirit of discipline and the firm will to resist. Not only that, Italy can take advantage of this extraordinary situation to promote the development of all domestic production industries, so that it can break away from foreign restraints economically, which is also beneficial to Italy. At this point, the meeting was adjourned until January 18 next year. (21st Havas Telegram)</p>

However, it is rumored that the convoy is heading to the "triangular restricted zone" in northwestern Egypt near Sallum Bay. Since British troops began concentrating on the Libyan border, large numbers of British troops have been transported there. According to reliable sources, there are currently between 85,000 and 120,000 British army and navy personnel in Egypt, as well as 1,000 aircraft, in full wartime deployment. Moreover, according to people arriving from Sallum today, British troops have been actively preparing defenses for several weeks, currently busy digging trenches, installing barbed wire, and concentrating motorized units. Egyptian officials today stated that Egypt will declare its full support for Great Britain. (21st National Telegram)</p>
<h3>Changes in British Cabinet; Foreign Secretary Position Temporarily Held by Baldwin</h3>
<p>London - There will be changes in the British cabinet personnel during the new year. First Lord of the Admiralty Monsell may retire after the naval conference concludes. It is widely expected that the post of Foreign Secretary will be temporarily held by Prime Minister Baldwin. Some say that Austen Chamberlain is hopeful for the position, but he is known for his association with France, which is currently unpopular, and it is doubtful whether he himself is willing to take on this difficult role. Eden's name is also mentioned frequently, and some still hope for Lord Privy Seal Halifax, but he is already a member of the House of Lords, making it inconvenient for him to accept this position again. Currently, Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain is the most favored. During the House of Commons debate on the Anglo-French peace plan on Thursday, Prime Minister Baldwin's speech was unremarkable. It was Chancellor of the Exchequer's quick thinking and debate with the opposition that saved the cabinet from danger and earned him nationwide praise. Therefore, it is widely believed that he would be able to handle the post of Foreign Secretary competently and happily. The House of Commons has been adjourned until February 4th.

<h3>Albanian Army Attacks Italian Outpost; Fierce Fighting in Aksum</h3>
<p>Albania - The Albanian army launched a fierce attack on an Italian outpost this morning, and both sides are still engaged in fierce fighting west of the holy city of Aksum. According to official sources, the Albanian army has retaken two Italian defensive positions, along with ten tanks, eighteen machine guns, and two mortars. According to the latest news from Tass, there was hand-to-hand combat for two hours, and Italian aircraft could not assist due to the proximity of the two armies. According to Albanian war news, the Italian army was defeated, with 550 casualties, including 150 Italian officers and soldiers. This Albanian operation clearly aims to carry out its plan to break through the Italian army's right flank west of the holy city of Aksum. (21st Reuters Telegram)</p>

<h3>US Treasury Advisor Suggests Reopening Silver Conference; Authorities Disagree</h3>

<p>Washington - The Department of Commerce announced today that, according to the first nine months of 1935, Japan's total exports of silver were worth 144,000,000 yen.

Based on what is known about Japan's silver reserves and registered silver imports, it should not be so much. At the same time, the Department of Commerce has received reports of private exports of silver from China being seized. The Department of Commerce also released a report on US-China trade for the first nine months of 1935, stating that US exports totaled $31,667,000, compared to $60,540,000,000 in the same period last year. The Department of Commerce did not criticize the sharp decline in US-China trade but noted that the Chinese authorities believe that China's purchasing power has been reduced due to the US Treasury Department's implementation of the silver purchasing program, which has caused silver prices to rise.

<h3>Naval Conference Status: Japan Isolated Four Against One; British Shipbuilding Declaration Also Stalled; France to Propose Compromise at Next Meeting</h3>
<p>London - Apart from holding a preliminary meeting and a general representatives meeting on December 9th, the Naval Conference has held seven sessions of the First Committee to date. All sessions have been conducted in a friendly atmosphere, focusing on the restriction of naval armaments. The proposals studied so far are: 1) Japan's suggestion to establish a common maximum limit; 2) Britain's suggestion that each country make unilateral and automatic declarations on shipbuilding in the coming years to limit armaments. These two proposals have been thoroughly studied by the public. It is generally agreed that the best way to resolve all issues at the conference is to first review possible solutions, in order to determine the possibility of a fair plan from this analysis. Therefore, judging from the continuous discussions, although the representatives of various countries feel that a qualitative limitation contains great value, a final resolution has not yet been reached on the principles under the alternative methods currently being studied. The committee is scheduled to reconvene on January 6th. (20th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>London - The representatives of Great Britain, Japan and the United States have discussed the Japanese and British proposals in the past two weeks, but the views of the three countries' representatives have not changed from the preliminary talks. Although the Japanese representatives have strived to thoroughly implement the principle of disarmament, their effect has only extended to the superficial breaking of the ratio system, and they have failed to completely convince the representatives of various countries. Although the United States and Great Britain have an attitude of respecting the opinions of the Japanese delegation, there is little doubt that the two countries are cooperating to deal with Japan. As for the representatives of France and Italy, due to the subtle relationship of the European political situation, they expressed sympathy to the British government. Regardless of theoretical disputes, the conference situation shows that Japan is isolated with a ratio of four to one. However, the British shipbuilding declaration case has little hope of success due to Japan's strong opposition. A certain US representative expressed pessimistic opinions on this, saying that after the First Committee adjourns, the shipbuilding declaration case is still an issue, but one cannot expect its proceedings to be satisfactory. From this point of view, because the conflicting views of various countries are clear, the meeting enters adjournment, its function is nothing more than temporarily avoiding the crisis of the meeting encountering a deadlock. According to the opinions of the British and other countries' representatives, if the quantitative limitation case cannot be resolved, they want to resolve the qualitative problem. However, the Japanese representatives insisted on the doctrine that quantity and quality cannot be separated, and decided on a policy that absolutely opposes discussing the qualitative limitation case before the quantitative limitation case is resolved. Therefore, after the meeting reopens, it will inevitably fall into a standstill unless a new proposal appears. (22nd Japan United Press Telegram)</p>
<p>London - Advisors to the delegations of various countries to the Naval Conference are currently planning to re-study the British proposal during the Christmas holidays. It is doubtful whether they can find any beneficial points at that time. Judging from the intensity of Japan's opposition to the British proposal during today's meeting of the General Committee, it is also questionable whether this case has any value for continued discussion. Looking at the Naval Conference for the past ten days, no progress has been made. The only result is that the exact nature of the conflicts between the claims and divergent opinions of various countries is becoming increasingly obvious. A certain US representative said, "Although the British proposal has not been abandoned, I have not seen any progress in the discussion." The situation of the Naval Conference can be seen in this statement. (2nd Havas News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>London - According to what our agency's naval problem reporter knows, the result of today's meeting of the General Committee has sufficiently proved that Japan firmly opposes the quantitative limitation method, even if it wants to maintain the current 5:5:3 ratio in accordance with the plan proposed by Great Britain. When the Naval Conference continues to meet on January 6th of next year, if the common maximum amount system proposed by Japan is not accepted by other countries, and it wants to discuss the issue of qualitative limitation, it is still uncertain whether Japan will accept it. Naval officials predict that if the plans proposed by Great Britain and Japan are not resolved at that time, then the continental countries of Europe, perhaps France, will propose a compromise plan and have it discussed by the Naval Conference.

<p>Wuhan Students Hold Parade and Demonstration</p>
<p>20,000 Students from the Three Towns Participate, Maintaining Excellent Order and Issuing Solemn Declaration</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Since the establishment of the Wuhan Middle School and Above Student National Salvation United Association on the 17th, it has authorized the executive committee to actively prepare for a large-scale parade and demonstration. On the 18th and 19th, meetings were held continuously to discuss, elect representatives from each school, and organize a parade committee, divided into six groups: Command Group (Wuhan University), Arrangement Group (Zhonghua University), Document Group (Girls' High School), Propaganda Group (Huazhong University), Discipline Group (Provincial High School), and Transportation Group (Senior Business School). It was decided that the three towns of Wuhan would hold separate parades on the 20th, with Wuhan University and Huazhong University as the general commanders of Wuchang, Zhonghua University and Municipal No. 1 Boys' High School as the general commanders of Hankou, and Higher Engineering School as the general commander of Hanyang. Each school elected a chief leader. Hearing that the government intended to dissuade them, the action was carried out secretly. Late on the 19th, the provincial government received a document from the Student National Salvation United Association and immediately invited members of the provincial and municipal party committees, the mayor of Hankou, and heads of various departments of the provincial government to the provincial government early on the 20th to jointly convene student representatives for talks and dissuasion. The student representatives also stated the purpose of the parade: To awaken the public; To oppose autonomy in North China; To support the patriotic movement in North China; and to solemnly declare that they would maintain order during the parade. The party and government authorities could no longer object, and the students of each school set out separately.</p>
<p>In Wuchang, students from Wuhan University and Huazhong University gathered at the Pingyue Road for a general assembly. More than 10,000 students from over 40 schools, including Huazhong University, Wuhan University, Zhonghua University, Provincial High School, Union Theological Seminary, Bowen, Yujie, Wenxue, Xiangshi, Zhangchu, Wenhua, Provincial Boys' Vocational School, Provincial Girls' Vocational School, Xilida, Chucai, Zhongda Affiliated High School, Girls' Normal School, Experimental School, No. 12 Middle School, No. 9 Middle School, Dajiang, Dagong, Wenhua No. 2, Wuzhong, Art College, College of Education, Huazhong University Affiliated High School, Sanchu, Senior Business School, Provincial No. 1 Girls' Middle School, No. 2 Girls' Middle School, Linghu, and Jingnan, gathered. After the assembly, a command group meeting was held, and Guo Xiyuan, a representative from Wuhan University, was elected as the general commander, with Xu Shengjie from Wuhan University and Zhu Jiayou from Huazhong University as deputy general commanders. The female students were in the front, and the male students were in the rear. The group marched from Pingyue Road through Pinghu Gate to Hanyang Gate. Wuhan University temporarily proposed crossing the river to Hankou to participate. However, Wuhan shipping had been ordered by the Construction Department to suspend service. Unable to fly across the natural barrier, the general and deputy commanders decided that the entire team would be divided into two parts. One part, led by Huazhong University, would march along the original route. The other part, led by Wuhan University, would temporarily stay at Hanyang Gate, and Guo Xiyuan and Zhu Jiayou would go to the Construction Department to request the resumption of ferry service. The request was denied, so they led the team to the provincial government to petition, but it was still difficult to get permission. They stood for a long time. At 3:00 PM, the leaders of each school decided to temporarily leave the provincial government and continue the parade, which proceeded from the assembly at Pingyue Road, through Pinghu Gate, Hanyang Gate, Chayuanpo, Fuyuan Street, Wuchang Road, Yuema Factory, Dachao Street, Baoanmen Main Street, Lanling Street, Zhizimaling, Nanlou, and disbanded at Simenkou. The students who remained at Hanyang Gate were still waiting for the ferry at night, hoping to fulfill their original intention of crossing the river.</p>
<p>In Hankou, the gathering was at Yiyuan. In addition to the full participation of students from various schools in Hankou, each school in Wuchang was notified by the National Salvation Association to send at least 20 students to participate. Students from Wuhan University and several other schools crossed the Han River on the 19th, but many were blocked in Wuchang due to the suspension of ferries and had to cross by private boats. At 10:00 AM, those assembled at Yiyuan included several thousand students from over 20 schools, including Luoyi Girls' High School, Yixun Girls' High School, Zhonghua University, Wuhan University, Xinmian Girls' High School, Jianghan Middle School, Provincial Rural Normal School, Provincial No. 9 Middle School, Municipal No. 1 Boys' Middle School, Aurora Middle School, Wuhan Girls' Middle School, Hanguang Middle School, Wenhua No. 2, E'nan Middle School, Municipal No. 1 Girls' Middle School, Boxue Middle School, Municipal Vocational School, and Hanjiang Middle School. At 11:00 AM, when other students had not arrived, knowing there were obstacles, the parade committee, led by the general commander of Hankou, You Liangguo, a representative from Zhonghua University, and deputy general commanders Yin Jichuan and Zhou Jueshan, ordered the team to set off. Following the planned route, they passed Xinsheng Road to Jianghan Customs, proceeded west along the river, passed the China Merchants Bureau to Minquan Road, turned into Sanmin Road, entered Zhongshan Road, passed Yiyuan again, and entered Special District 3 and Special District 2 to the YMCA, turned onto Huangpi Road, and then along the riverside of Special District 2 to the Lanling Road intersection, where they disbanded.</p>
<p>In Hanyang, the gathering was outside the Higher Engineering School, and the representative from the Higher Engineering School served as the general commander. Students from the Higher Engineering School, No. 12 Middle School, and Yizhi School participated. The Jin Nu Middle School did not participate due to a ban from the school authorities. The route was from the Higher Engineering School through Chang Street to Qingchuan Pavilion, where they disbanded.</p>
<p>In total, over 20,000 students participated in the parades in the three locations. They held banners, shouted slogans, and were full of energy, creating a tense atmosphere. Traffic control and discipline personnel patrolled left and right, so the order was well maintained. The declaration of the Student National Salvation United Association is as follows: "Fellow compatriots, the establishment of our National Salvation United Association stems from a sincere patriotic fervor and fulfills the due duty of citizens. We feel that China's peril has reached a final juncture. If everyone continues to live in a drunken dream, failing to unite and seek salvation, we will witness our beautiful land being completely destroyed. Although we know that many students in Beiping have already sacrificed for the patriotic movement, slaughtered by our own military and police, this is not enough to intimidate us. We have hot blood, we have heads, we have an indomitable spirit, and we have an innate patriotic ambition. Will we still shrink and fear? With the country in imminent danger, we cannot but cry out to the government, cannot but urge the government to make a decision as soon as possible. The violent aggressor is advancing day by day. If we continue to retreat and tolerate, in the near future, our 400 million compatriots will die without a burial place. For the sake of the nation's preservation, for the sake of world peace, and for the sake of justice and righteousness, we will not hesitate to fight to the death. We ask the government to mobilize immediately. Our country is complete and cannot tolerate the existence of so-called autonomous organizations. Yin Rugeng betrays the country, sells territory, and willingly acts as a traitor, which is intolerable to the people of the whole country. We ask the government to issue an immediate order to suppress him and relieve the suffering of compatriots under his rebellious oppression, preserving the integrity of our territory. We ask the government for open diplomacy and the freedom of speech, association, and assembly for the people, which are already enshrined in the law. We ask the government to earnestly protect this. The patriotic movement of students in Beiping is a true expression of popular will. We ask the government to adopt their opinions and ensure their safety, immediately punish the military and police instigators in Beiping, and comfort the dead and injured classmates. The people of the whole country must quickly awaken and unite to safeguard the integrity of the nation's territory and sovereignty and to overthrow our heinous, treacherous, and venomous aggressors." The slogans and banners were as follows: Punish the rebel Yin Rugeng; Forcibly stop all similar autonomous organizations; [Omitted]; We vow to be the backing of our patriotic compatriots in North China; [Omitted]; Please make government diplomacy open; Please mobilize the whole country; The people of the whole country must unite; Please guarantee the patriotic movement; Safeguard the integrity of the nation's territory and sovereignty.

<h3>Han Fuqu Sends Armored Vehicles to Escort Students Back to Their Hometowns; Military and Police Determined to Disperse Student Meetings</h3>
<p>Heavy Military and Police Guard at the Gates of All Schools</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Since the students of Jinan High School joined forces with middle schools and other schools in the city to form a National Salvation Corps, Education Director He Siyuan, upon the instruction of Provincial Government Chairman Han Fuqu, issued a notice yesterday (the 18th), ordering all middle schools to suspend classes and go on vacation from the 18th. Military and police were also dispatched to guard the gates of each school. On the 18th, representatives from each school held a plenary meeting to discuss the organization of the National Salvation Corps. After gathering at Zhengyi Middle School, the meeting was dispersed by the military and police before it could even begin. The representatives then gathered at Jinan Rural Normal School and were again expelled. As a result, they gathered at Mount Woniu, more than 20 miles from the city, to hold a meeting. Due to the lateness of the hour, specific measures regarding the organization of the National Salvation Corps were not clearly discussed. On the 19th, students from Jinan Girls' High School, Jinan Girls' Normal School, Jinan Girls' Vocational School, Jinan Normal School, and other schools were forced to leave school by the military and police. Han Fuqu also sent armored vehicles to escort them separately. However, students from Jinan High School, Jinan Middle School, and Private Yuying School did not leave school. The military and police guards at the gates of these schools were even tighter. Students without passes were not allowed to pass, and no one from outside the school was allowed to visit. News reporters were also forbidden from visiting. (19th)</p>
<h3>Editor-in-Chief of Hong Kong Kung Sheung Daily News, Lai Kung Chi, Assassinated; Shot in the Abdomen and Leg; Police Detectives Actively Pursuing the Culprit</h3>
<p>Hong Kong Correspondence: Lai Kung Chi, the editor-in-chief of the Kung Sheung Daily News, was shot and assassinated by a thug disguised as a coolie on Li Yuen Street East at 1:00 PM on the 16th, after finishing work. Lai was shot twice and fell to the ground. The assassin calmly escaped afterward. The details are listed below:</p>
<p>Details of the Assassination: The entrance of Li Yuen Street East is diagonally opposite the Kung Sheung Daily News. After finishing work at the newspaper office, Lai walked into the street, intending to go straight to Queen's Road. Unexpectedly, when he reached the front of Chang Sheng Hong at No. 1 Li Yuen Street East, he was shot twice from behind by a thug. Lai immediately fell to the ground after being injured. The newspaper office was alarmed by the news, and several staff members rushed to investigate. At that time, Lai had been helped by people from nearby shops to sit on a wooden stool. When he saw his newspaper colleagues, he said, "I was shot twice, once in the abdomen and once in the foot." At that time, an Indian policeman who heard the alarm arrived and called a Red Cross ambulance to the scene to take him to the National Hospital for treatment. Lai was very conscious in the ambulance. His colleagues comforted him, saying that he would be at the hospital soon. Lai was still able to reply, "I know." When the ambulance arrived at the hospital, the doctor happened to be at lunch. Lai urged someone to ask the doctor to come quickly and asked Tan Jia Shi, the doctor, to give him an injection to relieve the pain, saying, "The bullet hit my abdomen." Tan quickly undressed him to examine him but saw no signs and no bleeding. Later, he saw a bluish bruise on his side and examined Lai's back, where he saw two wounds, one entering from behind the right side to the abdomen and one entering from the right thigh. Both bullets were still inside his body. The doctor told him to move his right foot, but Lai replied, "I can't." The doctor then took his pulse and felt that his pulse was very weak, but Lai was still in good spirits at the time, only groaning slightly. Dr. Tan then asked Lai who had shot him and whether he recognized the assassin. Lai replied, "Because the assassin shot from behind, I don't know what the assassin looks like." He then said to the doctor, "Why ask so many questions? Please save me first." The doctor then used a stretcher to carry him to room No. 2, changed his clothes, and prepared for surgery. At that time, Lai was very conscious and said to his colleagues, "There is a key to my desk in my vest pocket. Give it to a colleague to do my work. I don't think I can return to the office tonight." He then said that there were a hundred yuan in his clothes and pants pockets and asked them to give it to his wife. He also asked for paper and pen to write something. Later, feeling unable to support himself, he said to his colleagues that he was very tired and didn't have much hope. He asked them to tell the Kung Sheung Daily News and Southwest Middle School to ask for some money for his mother so that she could return to her hometown and live out her life. At this time, Deputy Superintendent Jia Lude Luo and Detective Assistant Yi Lushi Dun had arrived at the hospital and asked the injured person for a statement as usual. Lai's answers were the same as what he told the doctor. Finally, the detectives asked if he had any enemies he could think of. Although Lai answered, the case was not very clear and could not be published. When the detectives asked Lai the reason again, Lai did not answer because he was tired.</p>
<p>Treatment Process: After the detectives left, the nurses prepared everything for the surgery. When they wanted to use anesthesia, Lai suddenly refused, saying, "This is anesthesia. I don't want to use it," and "I must use an X-ray to see it before cutting." After speaking, he shouted to a colleague outside the ward. However, he was eventually anesthetized by the doctor and carried into the operating room. Before the surgery, according to Dr. Tan Jia Shi, although Mr. Lai was very conscious, his condition was considered extremely serious due to his weak pulse. Now, surgery was the only way to save him. At this time, it was already 4:00 PM. The surgery was then performed by Dr. Tan and several assistants to remove the bullet from his abdomen. It was found that the bullet was a .32 caliber lead bullet. Because the bullet entered from the back of the side, the small and large intestines in the abdomen were pierced. Afterward, the doctor said that although the intestines had been reconnected, the condition was extremely serious because hot blood had flowed back into the abdomen. It was expected that the patient would not be able to sleep tonight (the 16th) and that the wound in the abdomen would become inflamed tomorrow (the 17th). Lai became conscious again around 6:00 PM after the surgery. He ordered his family to come to his bedside and comfort him. Although Lai was very tired at the time, he was still able to say to his family, "Don't cry. I'm fine now. I'm saying these words to comfort you. Go home."</p>
<p>Police Action: After the case occurred, the police immediately took action and went to the scene of the incident on Li Yuen Street East to search pedestrians and inquire about the details from people in nearby shops. Four people who had witnessed the assassin shooting were taken to the police station. It is said that the assassin was about 27 or 28 years old, disguised as a coolie, wearing an old felt hat and carrying a bamboo pole. He followed Lai and used the felt hat to cover the gun when he shot. Afterward, he wrapped the gun in newspaper, put it back in his chest pocket, took a few steps towards Queen's Road, and then slowly walked towards the Central Market after seeing that no one was chasing him. Although the assassin was barefoot, his flesh was very white and he did not look like a coolie. As the police were taking action, Assistant Superintendent Ma Fei went to Lai's mistress's place on Hennessy Road, Wan Chai, to investigate everything. According to Lai's mistress, Lai was shot at by a thug in Sham Shui Po on the 5th. His head was injured, and his felt hat was also pierced. The wound was triangular. Lai chased the thug half a street away but was eventually escaped. Afterward, Lai told his mistress that he had no enemies and that this must have been a case of mistaken identity. Lai's wife, Mrs. Chen, lives on Pokfulam Road. According to her, Lai's head was injured on the 5th because he was hit with the butt of a gun by an enemy. Because the gun suddenly misfired when the thug pointed it at Lai, he angrily used the butt of the gun to injure him. However, according to a relative of Lai, Mr. So-and-so, Lai had received threatening letters a week before being hit on the head with the butt of a gun, expressing extreme dissatisfaction with his duties at a certain newspaper. At that time, his family advised Lai to take strict precautions, but Lai said that he had already published a notice a month ago resigning from his duties at a certain newspaper and did not think he would be hated by anyone. Unexpectedly, this incident happened soon after, which was very unfortunate. After Lai was shot at by a thug in Sham Shui Po and failed, Lai carried his self-defense pistol with him at all times. If the thug had not shot him from behind on the 16th, he would not have escaped so easily.</p>
<p>Lai Kung Chi's Brief History: Lai Kung Chi, from Ningming County, Guangxi, is 44 years old. In his early years, he graduated from the industrial department of Guangxi Second Middle School and the engineering department of the Guangxi Army Military Academy. When Sun Yat-sen opened his government in Guangzhou, he served as an adjutant in the headquarters. When Ma Junwu was the governor of Guangxi Province, he appointed Lai as the magistrate of Longzhou County. He began his career in journalism at the Xiangjiang Morning Post, which was founded by Sun Yat-sen as a revolutionary organ. The Kung Sheung Daily News was founded by Lai and organized to oppose the Communist Party. It has been over ten years since its establishment. He is currently the editor-in-chief of the Kung Sheung Daily News and also served as the supervisor of the Tam Hoi Teng Pao. He was also a teacher at Southwest Middle School in Hong Kong. Last month, he published a notice resigning from his concurrent position at the Tam Hoi Teng Pao. Lai is usually silent and smiles little. He is kind and approachable to others and is good at calligraphy and painting. He devoted himself to the revolutionary cause in his early years. Now, he has been tragically shot by a thug for unknown reasons, which has caused many to sigh. Lai has an elderly mother, wife, and daughter in Hong Kong. His eldest daughter is currently 16 years old, and his son is 11 years old. However, Lai is usually generous, so he has no long possessions at home. His situation is often that of an empty-handed man. The police are now taking this case very seriously and will arrest the culprit and bring him to justice.</p>
<p>Following Luo's Footsteps: Since Hong Kong has had newspapers for 72 years, the incident of a Chinese newspaper reporter being shot by a thug was last year when Luo Weijiang, the president of Tiannan Daily, was shot at by a thug from behind while walking on Longhua Street. Fortunately, Luo immediately ran into a foreign goods store and was able to escape death. Now, Lai Kung Chi has also been shot, making him the second newspaper reporter to be shot in Hong Kong's history. (17th)</p>
<h3>Chaoshan Unified Anti-Smuggling; Smuggled Goods Dumping Has Been Sanctioned; Japanese Residents in Shantou Discuss Countermeasures</h3>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: Because smuggled goods are rampant in the Chaoshan area, the authorities have implemented unified inspections and divided the Chaoshan area into six inspection zones, all under the jurisdiction of the Chaoshan Land and Water Anti-Smuggling Office. Currently, there are two anti-smuggling platoons in Chaoshan, with 280 soldiers. There are also no fewer than 100 supervisors, special agents, and investigators. In addition, district directors are set up in each county of Chaoyang, Chao'an, Jieyang, Huihe, Raoping Chenghai. Outside the anti-smuggling districts of each county, sub-cards are set up to specialize in the inspection and release of land and water transportation matters. All goods in transit, if there is no special tax certificate attached to the goods or if there is no inspection and release certificate passed by each sub-card, will be considered smuggled goods and punished, confiscated, and the consignor, transporter, and consignee must all be jointly responsible. After this method was implemented, legitimate merchants felt that the procedures were cumbersome, but they believed that following these procedures was tantamount to obtaining protection, and that this method was also a powerful tool to prevent smuggled goods from invading the Chaoshan-Meizhou hinterland and seizing the market, so they were happy to comply. Moreover, the goods of various organized smugglers in Shantou have been piled up like mountains in the bird bridge back warehouses in Shantou since the implementation of this method, making it impossible to transport them to the hinterland. On the 28th of last month, the smugglers sent several sailing ships to dump rice and beans in Chao'an and along the Han River, and two ships were detained under the Xiangzi Bridge. Later, through the intercession of the Republican Foreign Company and a certain foreign rogue, who claimed that the goods were being transported to provide relief to foreign nationals and not for smuggling profits, the anti-smuggling authorities, in order to avoid trouble, agreed to deal with the matter leniently and allowed them to be taken back. Those who usually collude with smugglers have therefore been slightly restrained and dare not continue to transport or sell duty-free smuggled goods on behalf of others. Moreover, legitimate business firms in Chaoshan, after paying taxes on goods transported to the interior according to procedures, are free to buy, sell, and transport through all card ports, so business is beginning to thrive. Because tax-free goods, although cheap, are not as easy to sell as taxed goods, and various grains can be transported in a continuous stream since the unified inspection. The customs is also stepping up anti-smuggling, with the aim of cracking down on the illegal export of silver and the illegal import of goods. Since this month, customs has seized dozens of cases of silver smuggling, worth more than 20,000 yuan, and also seized a large number of smuggled goods on ships and in the city. Yesterday, 66 bags of white sugar and 3 packages of seafood that had been put into the warehouse were seized at the Nanshunfa Commercial Firm on Shangping Road in the city and escorted back to customs. It is reported that the commercial firm is opened by a rogue. Ryuqi Sakamoto, director of the Foreign Affairs Division of the Taiwan Governor-General's Office, arrived in Shantou on the Hai Ning Lun on the morning of the 8th. The Japanese Residents Association, the Taiwan Association, and others immediately convened a meeting to discuss the development of South China's business, the strict anti-smuggling measures in Shantou, and the transportation of goods by trade permits, and made decisions to propose to Sakamoto. This is also a matter that deserves attention.</p>
<h3>Anhui Province Repairs River Embankments: Construction Department Plans Outline of Measures</h3>
<p>Anqing Dispatch: The Anhui Province river embankment repair project was previously surveyed and estimated in sections by personnel dispatched by the Construction Department. The report was submitted to the National Economic Council, which decided, according to the river closure and embankment restoration clauses, that the central government would bear 342,000 yuan of the construction costs. Subsequently, 500,000 yuan of disaster relief public bonds were reallocated. Currently, the Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank are being contacted via telegram to mortgage the public bonds for cash. According to the National Economic Council's allocation list, the amount borne by the central government for this project is half of the construction costs required for the originally estimated primary projects in Anhui Province. The remaining half must be raised by Anhui Province itself. In addition, essential maintenance and repair projects should also be completed by Anhui Province on its own. Given Anhui Province's current financial resources, it is not easy to raise a large sum of money immediately, so it is planned to utilize civilian labor and make proper overall arrangements. According to the dispatched personnel's survey and estimate, the total amount of earthwork required for the construction of river embankments in Anhui Province is more than 7,060,000 cubic meters. Among them, more than 2,500,000 cubic meters are for closing river breaches, restoring embankments, and building long embankments and new embankments set back from the river. More than 4,500,000 cubic meters are for maintenance and repairs. It is planned to provide a subsidy of 5.5 fen per cubic meter for projects such as closing breaches, and a subsidy of 2.7 fen per cubic meter for maintenance and repair projects. In addition, the project costs that should be borne by the Ma Hua Tongren Embankment and other material costs for closing river breaches and restoring embankments, as well as project management fees, should not exceed the total amount of the originally allocated 342,000 yuan. Regarding construction methods, it is planned to follow the precedent of Anhui Province's repair of the main dikes of the Yangtze and Huai Rivers in the 23rd year of the Republic [1934], with personnel dispatched by the province to supervise and guide the work. The relevant county magistrates will conscript labor and dispatch personnel to assist in the process. Regarding the method of providing subsidies, it is planned to refer to the road repair precedent, with the county magistrates managing the funds. Subsidies will be distributed at any time based on the acceptance certificates made by the supervisors, and the expenses will be reported for verification upon completion of the work. A draft outline of measures for repairing the river embankments has been specially formulated and submitted to the provincial government for review and implementation. The outline of measures is recorded below:</p>
<p>This province has established the Anhui River Embankment Repair Works General Office to oversee and guide the implementation of construction matters. It is attached to the Anhui Province Water Conservancy Engineering Office and has a chief engineer and a deputy engineer, concurrently held by the director of the Water Conservancy Engineering Office and the chief of the Water Conservancy Works Section. Below it are the following works offices and supervisory sections: (Zi) Guanzhuang Embankment Works Office, also supervising the embankments along the Yangtze River in Tongling County; (Chou) Liubai Zhang Embankment Works Office; (Yin) Huangsitan Embankment Works Office, also supervising the embankments along the Yangtze River in Wuwei County; (Mao) Ma Hua Embankment Works Office, also supervising the embankments along the Yangtze River in Susong County; (Chen) Guangji Embankment Works Office, also supervising the embankments along the Yangtze River in Huaining County; (Ji) Wangjiang Supervisory Section; (Wu) Guidong Supervisory Section; (Wei) Fanchang Supervisory Section; (Shen) Wuhu Supervisory Section; (You) Dangtu Supervisory Section; (Xu) Hexian Supervisory Section; (Hai) Tongcheng Supervisory Section. The number of engineering affairs personnel to be dispatched to each of the above works offices and supervisory sections will be determined separately.</p>
<p>The repair of the river embankments shall be carried out according to the dike style stipulated by the National Government's Flood Relief Committee in the 20th year of the Republic [1931], with the dike surface one meter higher than the flood level, the dike surface four meters wide, the outer slope at a ratio of 1:3, and the inner slope at a ratio of 1:2 in the upper part and 1:5 in the lower part.</p>
<p>The repair of the river embankments shall be carried out by the works office or supervisory section, together with the relevant county government, conscripting labor for construction, and designating responsible personnel for each section, referring to the precedent of sectionally supervised repair of the Yangtze and Huai River dikes in this province last year. The work must be completed before the end of April of the 25th year of the Republic [1936]. The rules for conscripting and managing labor will be determined separately.</p>
<p>Each works office and supervisory section shall, based on the actual situation, refer to existing charts and diagrams, strictly adhere to the aforementioned stipulated dike style, set stakes, divide sections, and calculate in detail the amount of earthwork and the number of required laborers. A sectional earthwork and labor calculation table shall be prepared and submitted to the works general office for signature and report to the Construction Department, which will verify and forward it to the provincial government, ordering the relevant county government to conscript civilians according to the plan and have them report to work within a specified time limit. The "Construction Guidelines for Restoring Embankments" issued by the Yangtze River Water Conservancy Commission shall be followed to supervise and guide the construction. Acceptance inspections shall be carried out at any time, and acceptance certificates shall be issued so that subsidies can be claimed from the county. The detailed rules for the works office and supervisory office will be determined separately.</p>
<p>The aforementioned subsidies shall be calculated on the basis of the National Economic Council's subsidy to this province for river embankment repair, allocating 10% for various project management fees, as well as the amount to be shared between the Ma Hua and Tongren embankments after consultation with Hubei and Jiangxi provinces. The subsidies shall be divided into the following two categories according to the type of project: Category A: Closing breaches, restoring embankments, and constructing or retreating new embankments: (Zi) Guanzhuang Embankment, (Chou) Liubai Zhang, (Yin) Huangsitan, (Mao) Guangji Embankment Baojia Village, (Chen) Mapu Embankment Luhua Pond. Each cubic meter shall be subsidized by 5.5 fen. Category B: All maintenance and repair projects: Each cubic meter shall be subsidized by 2.7 fen.</p>
<p>The branch dikes connecting each section shall be strictly supervised by the relevant county government in accordance with repeated orders from the provincial government to strengthen and repair the valley embankments. Each works office and supervisory section shall also conduct inspections at any time. If there are any deficiencies, a portion of the acceptance certificate for the river embankment section may be deducted.</p>
<p>The river embankment repair subsidies for each county shall be recalculated by the Construction Department of the provincial government based on the original sectional earthwork calculation tables reported by each works office and supervisory section to determine the amount to be given. The funds shall be allocated to the relevant county governments in batches for management. Payments shall be made to workers based on the acceptance certificates issued by the works office or supervisory section, and receipts shall be collected and reported for reimbursement. The detailed rules for each county's management of subsidies will be determined separately. (December 20th)</p>
<h3>Hubei Province Conscripts Labor to Build People's Embankments and Roads: Projects to be Completed by Specific Deadlines</h3>
<p>Allowances and Miscellaneous Expenses to be Paid from Account Funds</p>
<p>Hankou Dispatch: The provincial government, considering that the people's embankments in various counties have not been repaired and that the water level is now falling during the winter season, urgently needs to seize the opportunity to repair them. Today, special orders were issued to the Flood Relief General Association, the Jianghan Engineering Bureau, and the special commissioners of various districts to have the county governments conscript labor to repair the county, bureau, and people's embankments under their jurisdiction by a specified deadline.

<p>Land Registration to End Next Summer</p>
<p>Except for the salt fields and wasteland in this county, the land has been completely surveyed by Dong Jinzhao, the director of the Land Bureau, who urged his subordinates to complete the work. Subsequently, registration was carried out based on the surveyed mu division. Landowners from various places, in view of the past chaos in land matters, eagerly hoped for reorganization. Therefore, since the start of registration, they have all enthusiastically registered with their old deeds and recent grain receipts. If there are mortgage relationships, the landowners have also jointly applied for registration with the creditors in accordance with the law. In order to protect creditors' rights and other considerations, the bureau requires landowners who present incomplete or completely lost documents to find a reputable guarantor to bear all responsibilities before registering. Land disputes arising from registration are handled by the bureau's committee at any time. Land that has been registered and has title deeds, as well as land that has not been registered after the deadline, will all be sealed. It is also heard that the person in charge of the bureau said that the overall land consolidation in this county is expected to be completed between May and June next year.</p>

<p>Madman Who Stabbed Women Arrested</p>
<p>In the past two months, incidents of thugs stabbing women walking at night have occurred continuously in Daotang Lane, Shangshu Lane, Changchun Lane, Gui Xiang and other places in the city. The perpetrator would strike and leave immediately without robbing any property. The motive for the attacks was difficult to determine.

Before the end of December of this year, each district should report the actual number of Jia head training institutes to be established. The expenses should be handled in accordance with the simplified regulations for Bao head training institutes in various counties.</p>
<p>Each district office should designate an assistant to handle household registration matters exclusively, so as to assign responsibilities and facilitate progress. Resolved: Passed.</p>
<p>This year is the National Labor Service Season. In accordance with the outline of measures, the rivers to be dredged in each district should be more than 50,000 cubic meters.

Resolved: It will be handled in accordance with the regulations of Jiangsu Province for clearing up household registration changes and organizing Baojia.</p>
<p>Changzhou</p>
<p>Chamber of Commerce Petitions Ministry of Finance to Amend Silver Management Rules</p>
<p>The Chairman of the Wujin County Chamber of Commerce, Xu Juxi, submitted a document to the Ministry of Finance on the 20th, stating: "According to a letter from the Chairman Jiang Junjia, Standing Committee Member Zhao Huanzi, and Tang Yuzhang of the Gold and Silver Industry Association, it is reported that Article 2 of the 'Silver Management Rules for Silver Products' promulgated by the Ministry of Finance on November 15 stipulates that the manufacture of silver utensils and ornaments should use chemical silver as raw material. If pure silver must be added, the amount of pure silver must not exceed 30%. This concerns the future of our silversmith industry greatly. Silver utensils, vessels, and ornaments have always contained 80% pure silver. If the pure silver content is reduced, the material will be harder and the color will be difficult to keep white. If the material is hard, it will be difficult to shape. If the color is not white, it will not be welcomed by customers. Even if it is successfully shaped, it will be easily broken upon impact. Intricate work such as figures, flowers, and plants will be impossible to make. Moreover, our country's workers are not familiar with science and adhere to traditional techniques. If the original silver content is changed to 30%, it will be extremely difficult for silversmiths to implement. For the sake of the industry's future, we have no choice but to implore your esteemed association to forward this petition to the Ministry of Finance to amend the silver management rules and allow the old silver content to be maintained without restrictions, so as to maintain the business and benefit industry and commerce." Based on this, after investigation, if silver vessels and ornaments contain too little silver, it will not only be difficult to work with but also easily damaged. The various points stated by the industry to preserve its business are truly based on the actual situation. It is appropriate to forward this petition based on the facts, hoping that your ministry will review and approve the modification and continue to handle it according to the old regulations, so as to maintain the business and comply with commercial sentiment.</p>

According to Shen, the closure project was originally organized by the Shandong Provincial Government. Since the 16th of this month, it has been transferred to the Yellow River Commission to take over. The original plan was to consolidate the remaining dike of Li Sheng Tun and build it into a solid eastern dike base. It has now been largely completed. Then, a new dike will be connected downstream of the Jiangsu dike to serve as the western dike base, and four water diversion dams will be built to divert the main current into the old river channel. Both are in progress.

In mid-May of this year, he received another threatening letter stating that the previous matter was not resolved and a deadline was set for negotiations. Sun dismissed it with a laugh. At around 4:00 PM on the 18th, a person suddenly came to the Nanhu Hotel and asked Sun how the money issue would be resolved. Seeing the situation was not good, Sun shouted loudly asking what money was being referred to. Hearing the sound, the hotel staff knew that the visitor was not a good person and reported it to the Guanyinge Police Station, which ordered the police to arrest the person. He was taken back for questioning and gave his name as Chen Yanqing, 30 years old, from Xiaoshan, living in Hangzhou, a silk merchant. He admitted to knowing Sun and borrowing money, but denied any previous threats. The arrested bandit was sent to the First Branch of the Public Security Bureau.

<h3>Rural Life Miscellany</h3>
<p>— Pan Yiyun</p>
<p>The Life of Silk Farmers in Shunde, Guangdong</p>
<p>General Social Background</p>
<p>Friends! When you board a steamer and leave Guangzhou, heading south along the West River for about two hours, you will arrive at Shunde County. Geographically, Shunde is located in the center of a delta in the lower reaches of the Pearl River. It borders Panyu County to the northeast, Zhongshan County to the southeast, Xinhui County to the southwest, and Nanhai County to the northwest. The area is mostly flat plains and slightly low-lying, with fertile soil, crisscrossed by waterways, making transportation very convenient. According to the statistics of the 19th year of the Republic of China (1930), the total population of Shunde County is over 1,426,000, living in 214 villages. Most of the people rely on silkworm farming as their main production activity, numbering about one million.</p>
<p>The Dwellings of Silk Farmers</p>
<p>Upon arriving in Shunde, what first catches the eye is probably the dwellings of the silk farmers. Generally, ordinary silk farmers live near the mulberry fields, clustered together in clans, ranging from a few families to dozens, in groups that may extend for miles or gather in one corner. The construction of their houses is very simple, with mud walls and thatched roofs everywhere. The interior naturally has a dirt floor, with very few windows, making it poorly ventilated and dimly lit. Their bedrooms and silkworm rearing rooms are mostly mixed and undivided, with silkworms and people crowded together, making their cramped conditions imaginable. There are also some poor silk farmers who migrate constantly, their dwellings scattered among the mulberry fields, built temporarily by themselves, naturally even more simple than the aforementioned type. From a distance, one only sees scattered thatched huts, appearing and disappearing among the mulberry bushes, arousing thoughts of the early days of primitive society.</p>
<p>The Farmland of Silk Farmers</p>
<p>The silk farmers in Shunde cultivate many mulberry fields themselves, usually adjacent to or near their residences. The area they cultivate varies in size, averaging from two to twenty mu at most. According to statistical reports, each silk farming household cultivates an average of 7.22 mu of mulberry fields, but over 92% of the land is rented from landlords. The rent per mu ranges from eight to forty yuan, depending on the size of the fish pond area and the fertility of the land. Commonly calculated, if fish ponds account for 29% of the mulberry field area, the annual rent per mu is twenty-one yuan. Here, the terms "fish pond" and "mulberry field" need to be clarified. Because the terrain in the silkworm-producing areas of Guangdong is low-lying, silk farmers manage mulberry fields using the "four parts water, six parts land" system. For example, in ten mu of mulberry fields, four mu should be used for fish ponds. Those who come to Shunde for the first time, seeing clear pond water and green mulberry fields everywhere, cannot help but feel a unique pastoral charm.</p>
<p>The Work of Silk Farmers</p>
<p>Their main work is naturally planting mulberry trees and raising silkworms. Around mid-March each year, silkworm rearing begins, involving the entire family. Generally, strong men and women are responsible for picking mulberry leaves and feeding silkworms, while elderly women and children engage in picking silkworms, collecting cocoons, reeling silk, and assisting with household chores. Because Guangdong has a mild climate, silkworm rearing can be done six or seven times a year. During the busiest times, they lack even sleep. Speaking of which, we must mention the issue of technology. Although the silk farmers are diligent, their production techniques, from silkworm rearing to silk reeling and silk weaving, are unreasonable, outdated, and unscientific. How to improve them in the future is a problem that urgently needs to be solved. In addition to silkworm rearing, fish farming is their main sideline. They use silkworm excrement, silkworm pupae, and silkworm moths as fish feed and can also use the mud from the ponds to enrich the mulberry fields, making it a quite worthwhile sideline.</p>
<p>The Education of Silk Farmers</p>
<p>Very few adult silk farmers in Shunde have received education. According to survey results, only nine out of one hundred people are literate, and 60-70% of school-age children are not enrolled in school. Because of the lack of education, the behavior of silk farmers often falls into superstition. When they encounter silkworm diseases or other losses during silkworm rearing, they blame ghosts and gods, trusting in fate, without making any efforts to remedy the situation. Almost every family worships the Silkworm Goddess, and many also rely on stone and clay idols for protection. What we see in the silkworm villages, whether in street corners or alleyways, are piles of stone pebbles, surrounded by incense smoke. This is their patron saint, the master of their souls. What a serious education problem this is!</p>
<p>The Health of Silk Farmers</p>
<p>From our superficial observations, we can naturally see that the health of Shunde silk farmers is not good. According to a survey of the health of 105 families in the Shunde Sericulture Improvement Implementation Area in the 22nd year of the Republic of China (1933), the statistics showed a population of 457 people, of whom 133 were unhealthy. In the same year, a survey of infant mortality in 100 families showed that out of 582 children born, 234 died. Furthermore, according to the treatment report for October of this year from the general district of the implementation area, in one month, 88 patients sought treatment for skin diseases, 80 for ear, nose, and throat diseases, 94 for internal medicine, 132 for surgery, 8 for parasitic diseases, 4 for dental diseases, 75 for red eye and other diseases, and 2 were hospitalized, totaling 397 people. The population under the jurisdiction of the general district is only about four to five thousand. Therefore, the health status of silk farmers is self-evident.</p>
<p>The Economic Income of Silk Farmers</p>
<p>In the past, Shunde was a very wealthy county. In the 11th year of the Republic of China (1922), the export value of raw silk from Guangdong Province was over 110 million yuan, most of which was handled by the people of Shunde. At that time, they were the fortunate ones, living a life of extreme affluence, feasting, celebrating, singing, and dancing. But since the world economic crisis, the price of silk has plummeted; and because their production technology is too backward, they have lost the market. The entire silk industry in the county has been declining day by day, and today it is in a state of bankruptcy. According to a recent survey, only 4% of the silk farming households in the county can make a slight profit annually, no more than 4% can barely break even, and as many as 92% suffer losses every year. As a result, those who have dropped out of the business have dropped out, those who have lost their jobs have lost their jobs, and those who are in debt are in debt. Everyone is struggling on the brink of death.</p>
<p>Shunde, the life of the silk farmers of Shunde as a whole, is what is displayed to us, a picture of such sorrow and suffering.</p>

<h3>The Municipal Board of Education's Message to All Students in the City</h3>
<p>The Municipal Board of Education has always been very enthusiastic about guiding students. Regarding the patriotic movement of students in various schools in the city, it has promised to pay attention to it. Yesterday, it specially issued a public notice to students at all levels in the city. The public notice is excerpted below: Students, in recent days, you have been holding on to the enthusiasm of patriotism, braving the wind and dew, and enduring the rain and cold, conducting disciplined activities, arousing the masses, and making petitions with blood and tears, expressing public opinion. It is pitiable and righteous. All of us citizens cannot but agree with you. Now, the responsible authorities have sincerely sympathized. All of you students should restrain your emotions and strive to save the country without forgetting to study. Focus on your studies, work hard to save the country in your own positions, and wait patiently for the government to resolve the situation. That would be fortunate indeed.</p>
<h3>Women Rising Up to Save the Nation Held a General Meeting Yesterday, with Heartfelt Speeches by He Xiangning, Gan Xiaoying, and Others</h3>
<p>According to New Sound News Agency, since the students in Peiping launched the save-the-nation movement, women's cultural organizations in the city have also risen up to prepare for the Shanghai Women's National Salvation Joint Association.

A general meeting was convened at 2:00 PM yesterday, with more than one hundred groups and over one thousand participants. Those who arrived later could not find seats and stood in the back rows in an orderly manner.

<h3>The Passenger Train from Hangzhou to Shanghai Was Delayed Twice Yesterday Due to Students from Hangzhou Boarding the Train to Petition in Beijing. Local Officials Tried Their Best to Persuade Them to Disperse at Noon</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, students from various places, in response to the anti-pseudo-autonomy movement of students in Peiping, petitioned and paraded to local administrative officials. After the authorities earnestly persuaded them, the order was very good. According to news from the two railway bureaus yesterday, students in Hangzhou demanded to take the train to Jinjing to petition, but their request was not approved. They boarded the train one after another to prevent it from departing, causing the express train from Hangzhou to Shanghai at 7:00 AM yesterday and the special express train at 8:55 AM to be unable to depart on time. The railway bureau and local officials tried their best to dissuade them. At 12:30 PM, the students began to disperse, and train operations resumed as usual. However, the first train was delayed by six hours, and the second train was delayed by four and a half hours. As for the trains from Shanghai to Hangzhou, they arrived as usual and were not delayed.</p>
<h3>The Ministry of Finance Plans to Establish Eight Major Banks. In Addition to Reorganizing the Central Bank into a Reserve Bank, Seven More Banks Will Be Established, Including Exchange, Real Estate, and Other Banks</h3>
<p>According to New Sound News Agency, the Ministry of Finance has achieved considerable results since implementing the new currency policy. In addition to reorganizing the Central Bank into the Central Reserve Bank, it also plans to establish seven banks, including exchange, industry, industrial, agricultural, real estate, trust, and savings banks. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Meeting Held Yesterday Afternoon: The Central Bank has decided to reorganize into the Central Reserve Bank, which has been prepared by the bank's board of directors. At the same time, in accordance with Article 7 of the Central Bank Law, 40% of the shares will be raised from businesses, and legal entities in the country's banking industry will be given priority to subscribe. The bank also held a meeting of standing directors at 11:30 AM yesterday. Standing directors Kong Xianxi, Chen Jian'an, Ye Zhuotang, Xu Kan, Tang Shoumin, and others attended. The meeting adjourned at around 12:00 PM. It is reported that the meeting was to prepare for the reorganization and to convene a board of directors meeting before the end of the month to discuss everything. As for the date of the reorganization and establishment, it may have to be postponed until next spring. The saying that it would be implemented on New Year's Day, as reported in the Jing telegram, is not feasible because the preparations cannot be completed in time.</p>
<p>Preparation in Order: In order to help the agricultural, industrial, and commercial sectors, the Ministry of Finance has decided to reorganize the Central Bank into the Central Reserve Bank, which will become a bank for banks, and plans to establish seven banks, including exchange, industry, industrial, agricultural, trust, savings, and real estate banks, making a total of eight banks. In addition to the Bank of China, which was originally a chartered international exchange bank specializing in exchange, and the Bank of Communications, which was originally a chartered bank for developing national industries specializing in industry, other banks such as industrial and agricultural banks will be established in due course.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Advocates Using "Currency" Instead of "Silver Dollar" in Bookkeeping</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce received a letter from Xu Chongdao Guoyaohao inquiring about what character should be used above the numbers recorded in Chinese bookkeeping to represent the term "silver dollar." The Chamber immediately replied in a letter stating, "The term 'silver dollar' has always been a common term and should be reformed. In theory, the two characters 'national currency' should be used instead. As your letter states, the grid in Chinese bookkeeping is short, and the two characters 'national currency' are too inconvenient, then it seems that using only the character 'currency' is also permissible. Since the amount is marked as so many yuan and so many jiao, it is known without asking that it is the national currency and not foreign currency."</p>
<h3>Zou Lu Visited Various Factories Yesterday and Expressed His Opinions on Developing Chinese Industry</h3>
<p>Central Committee member Zou Lu and Hu Wencan were invited by the China Industrial Federation to visit the Zhongxin Yarn Factory, Huacheng Tobacco Company, Commercial Press, and China Machine-Made Shoe Factory yesterday morning. Afterwards, they expressed their opinions on developing Chinese industry, saying that the reason for the underdevelopment of Chinese industry is insufficient capital and too few chips for operation. Therefore, there cannot be significant progress in the improvement of technology and the increase of production. For example, setting up a factory requires a capital of one million yuan. Eight out of ten parts have been used for machine factory buildings. The cash flow that is relied on for the production part is very small. In the past, when China's credit system had not been destroyed, a small amount of capital could be used for a large amount of production, so the strength was abundant and the financial resources were not exhausted. Today is very different from the past. If you want to revitalize Chinese industry, unless you turn the factory buildings, machines, and activities into cash, when there is more capital, there will naturally be more production. As for the fundamental cure, it is still to find a way to make the people have property, so that their purchasing power can be strengthened, and then the entire Chinese production can fundamentally find a way out. When asked about the impressions he got from visiting the factory, he summarized it by saying that the textile industry is beneficial to the people's livelihood and clothing and is deeply related to the national economy. I deeply feel that under any difficult circumstances, the government must maintain the Chinese yarn industry, lighten its burden, and make it prosperous, so that it can establish a position to compete with foreign countries. There are now very large sales of yarn in the Southwest. This time I will return to Guangdong and find ways to expand its market in a short period of time, and all methods cannot be successful without the cooperation of Shanghai and Guangdong. Mr. Rong Zongjing is courageous and persevering in this difficult situation, and his spirit and perseverance are admirable. The Commercial Press was destroyed by the fire of war at the old factory site after the January 28 Incident. Today it is restored, and all scales are gradually restored to their original state. This is the result of the efforts of the factory colleagues. The new factory of Huacheng Tobacco Company is large in scale and well-equipped. The machines used are all recently purchased from abroad, so its products can compete with foreign goods. The products of the China Machine-Made Shoe Factory are completely domestic products and the price is low. In the future, with mass production, the sales will be large. It is indeed a new emerging industry in China. In short, the decline of Chinese industry has reached its extreme, but the general colleagues can still resolutely fight, so I am still optimistic about the future of China.</p>
<h3>Guangxi Province Agricultural Study Group to Japan Returns to the Country Yesterday Morning, Arriving in Shanghai; Ou Yangyi and Others Continue to Investigate Agriculture in Jiangsu and Zhejiang; Liao Douguang and Seven Others Go Directly to Taiwan to Investigate</h3>

The remaining seven people, led by deputy group leader Liao Douguang, went directly from Japan to Taiwan to investigate the planting and sale of sugarcane, taro, and other crops in Taiwan. In the future, they will go directly from Taiwan to Hong Kong and return to Guangxi. A reporter from the New Voice Society learned that the five members of the study group, currently led by group leader Ou Yangyi, plan to continue investigating the agricultural situation in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces domestically, and also plan to visit North China. They have already telegraphed the Guangxi Provincial Government authorities to report their arrival in Shanghai and request instructions on whether to proceed. If the trip to North China does not materialize, then after investigating Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, they may go to Jiangxi to visit various new constructions in the bandit areas before returning to their post. The entire study group will visit new constructions in the city center area of Shanghai and major factories in Shanghai today and tomorrow to make an equivalent comparison after their visit to Japan, it is said. They will stay in Shanghai for three to five days, waiting for the Guangxi Province's reply telegram to arrive in Shanghai, before departing, it is said.</p>

<h3>Municipal Party Headquarters and Other Ten Organizations Hosted a Farewell Banquet for Ambassador Cheng Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Municipal Party Headquarters, Local Association, Banking Association, Municipal Farmers Association, Municipal Education Association, Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, Provisional Municipal Council, Journalists Association, Tongji University, and other organizations held a banquet at the YMCA of Eight Immortals Bridge at 6:15 pm last night to bid farewell to Ambassador to Germany Cheng Tianfang.</p>
<p>Participating Personnel: A total of ten organizations participated in the farewell, with guests and hosts totaling more than fifty people, including Ambassador Cheng, Chen Zehua, Zheng Xigu, Wu Xingya, Pan Gongzhan, Cai Jingjun, Wang Xiaolai, Weng Zhilong, Tong Hangbai, Wu Kaixian, Shen Tianxin, Du Yuesheng, Yu Zuoting, and Zhu Xuefan. Wu Xingya presided over the meeting and delivered a farewell speech on behalf of the organizations. Ambassador Cheng then replied, and Wang Xiaolai and Weng Zhilong also gave speeches. The meeting ended at 9 pm.</p>
<p>Chairman's Speech: Wu Xingya said in his speech that Ambassador Cheng has contributed to the Party and the country, and has worked hard to oppose communism since the 15th year of the Republic of China. Later, he served as the Director of Education in Anhui, Hubei, and other provinces. At this time of national crisis, Ambassador Cheng has assisted the central government in its work to revitalize the nation, which is a great contribution. Now, Ambassador Cheng is about to go to Germany. This trip is not only to promote friendly relations between China and Germany, but also because Germany, after the European War, was a defeated country that was completely destroyed. In just a few years, it has risen again. Although its race is different from ours, its great national spirit and tenacious national character are of great value for our country to learn from. Therefore, I hope that Ambassador Cheng will take responsibility and introduce everything about that country to serve as a mirror for our national revival, and also hope that he will publicize the current situation of our country's efforts to govern and revitalize the country to friendly countries in Europe, and so on.</p>
<p>Ambassador's Reply: Ambassador Cheng replied, saying that he has served in education and party affairs in the past, and is now ordered to be the ambassador to Germany. Because of the lack of experience, he is very apprehensive. I hope that everyone present will give me advice from time to time. Regarding our country's diplomatic policy, President Jiang and Foreign Minister Zhang have repeatedly clarified it. I will do it according to this policy. I would like to offer some opinions as follows. In the past, some people advocated the diplomatic strategy of "using barbarians to control barbarians," but I secretly believe that our country's diplomacy for thousands of years has adhered to the principles of peace and friendship. During the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods, academic thought flourished, and various schools of thought arose. The main schools of thought, such as Confucianism, Taoism, and Mohism, all opposed war, advocated peace, and sought to establish harmonious and friendly relations between countries. This kind of thought, even to this day, is still lurking in the national consciousness and has not changed slightly. Mozi advocated "universal love," which is the best policy for establishing international relations. It is certainly inappropriate to harm others to benefit oneself, and it is impossible in reality to harm oneself to benefit others. If both people and oneself can benefit, it is most appropriate. Therefore, in my opinion, if it can benefit both people and oneself and be applied to international relations, then international peace is promising. Germany's environment after the European War was worse than our country's current situation, but in just over ten years, its national strength has been steadily improving and has almost recovered to its pre-war strength. Its national spirit is great and outstanding, and its hard work and struggle are worthy of our imitation. This time I go, I will introduce the situation in that country in detail, and I will publicize the real situation of our country to friendly countries at any time. Since the German delegation came to China in the 19th year of the Republic of China, the relationship between China and Germany has become closer, and there has been more economic and cultural contact. In terms of economy, this year there is the organization of the Sino-German Trade Association. In terms of culture, Chinese classes have been added to German universities, and the Far East Association has been established. Our country also has the organization of the Sino-German Cultural Association, and many students go to Germany every year. The most fortunate thing is that several German universities will exchange students with Tsinghua University in our country. This is still an initiative, which shows that the relationship between China and Germany is becoming closer. Our country is rich in products and has a long history of culture, while Germany has a brilliant science and developed machinery. If these two countries and nations with their own advantages can work together, then the bright future will be boundless, and so on.</p>
<p>Wang Xiaolai's Speech: Wang Xiaolai said in his speech that the saying "a weak country has no diplomacy" is inappropriate. If a country considers itself weak, then there is no hope. Therefore, diplomats should uphold their indomitable spirit and negotiate diplomatically. Even if diplomacy fails, the individual diplomat will never fail. Weng Zhilong said in his speech that he hoped that Ambassador Cheng would introduce everything about Germany as much as possible and at the same time publicize everything about our country to foreign countries. The guests and hosts enjoyed themselves until 9 pm and then dispersed, it is said.</p>
<p>Ambassador to Germany Cheng Tianfang is about to leave the country to take office. Last night at 9 pm, Minister Kong specially sent Finance Decision Xu Kan as a representative to give him a farewell dinner at the International Hotel, and invited Zhong Wei Tan Zhen, Fu Rulin, Fu Bingchang, Lv Guang, Peng Xuepei, Tang Haian, and Chen Gongbo to accompany him. The host and guests dispersed at 11 pm.</p>

<h3>Postal and Telegraph Agency Offices to Be Established at Major Stations on Both Railways; Ministry Order Approved, to Be Implemented on New Year's Day Next Year</h3>
<p>The Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administration previously received an order from the Ministry of Communications to set up postal and telegraph agency offices at stations. The draft outline of measures proposed by the Ministry has been consulted with the Shanghai Telegraph Bureau and the Shanghai Postal Bureau, and provisional measures for setting up postal and telegraph agency offices at stations on both railways have been formulated. After approval by the Ministry, it is scheduled to be implemented starting on New Year's Day next year. Details are recorded as follows:</p>

To the extent possible, the agency office must have two doorways, one near the ticket office and one next to the platform, so that passengers in the waiting room and on the train can send and receive mail and telegrams at any time. Two wooden signboards will be specially installed at each office, one hanging in a prominent position on the platform and one hanging above the door of the agency office. The size and method of hanging the signs will be designated by the Railway Bureau. The color will be black with white letters. The cost of making and installing the signs will be borne by the Railway Bureau.

<p>Stipulated Duties</p>
<p>The office hours of the agency office are the same as the normal office hours of the station. However, in order to facilitate the sending and receiving of mail and telegrams from the outside, the agency office should make a sign showing the start and end times of receiving and sending various mail and telegrams and hang it at the door. The detailed times will be determined by the Railway Bureau. The duties of each agency office are to sell stamps, receive and send various ordinary registered express airmail items, and seal and dispatch parcels of mail to other places. The decision on the classes for sealing and dispatching parcels of mail at each agency office should be based on the trains with railway post office chiefs. The deadline for opening the mailbox and letterbox is fifteen minutes before the departure of the train. The deadline for sealing and dispatching is so that it can catch the train. When receiving and sending mail, in addition to ordinary mail, other registered express mail, etc., a receipt must be issued at the time of receipt and sent to the sender for safekeeping.

<h3>Measures for the Two Railway Bureaus to Encourage Merchants to Ship Goods Directly</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Railways previously believed that the method of giving rebates to forwarding agents by the railways was inconsistent with the original intention of responsible transportation of goods. The Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Bureaus discussed and drafted provisional measures to encourage merchants to ship goods directly. The draft has been reviewed in detail by the Traffic Department of the Railway Bureaus and reviewed by the Accounting Department, and then submitted by the Railway Bureaus to the Ministry of Railways for approval under No. 1090, to be piloted for one year starting from January 1 next year. The measures are recorded below. Article 1: All merchants who ship goods directly to the Beijing-Shanghai Railway or the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway of this bureau and enjoy the stipulated benefits shall first register with the bureau separately in accordance with the regulations. Article 2: When applying for registration, the name, organization, location, capital manager, and destination should be filled in detail, and a deposit should be submitted separately, 500 yuan in national currency for each railway. Article 3: The registration deposit shall be deposited in the bank by the bureau, and one decision shall be issued annually according to the bank interest rate. When the registration is cancelled, it shall be returned according to the receipt. Article 4: The registration deposit receipt is not allowed to be transferred, rented, or mortgaged. Article 5: Registered merchants whose total freight paid to each railway each year reaches 5,000 yuan in silver shall be given a rebate of 2.5 per mille by the bureau. Article 6: For goods transported under special agreements, the bureau shall give special rebates at its discretion, but the benefits of ordinary rebates shall not be enjoyed. Article 7: If half-price return empty items, the full joint transportation fee transported from other railways, and the other railway part of the joint transportation fee transported from this railway, have already enjoyed the public transportation discount benefits, or if the goods are transported as packages, various miscellaneous fees that are not within the scope of transportation, etc., shall not be rebated. Article 8: The settlement of rebates shall be one year from July 1 to June 30 of the following year.

<h3>Yu-Style Chinese Typewriter Offered as a Contribution to Flood Relief</h3>
<p>The Yu-style Chinese typewriter was invented by Yu Binqi, a mechanical engineer who studied in Japan. It was granted Patent Certificate No. 18 by the Ministry of Industry and has been supported by dignitaries and business tycoons of the National Government. Not only are many domestic institutions, organizations, and firms using it, but also countries such as Britain, the United States, Germany, and Japan are buying it. In the last two years, more than 500 units have been sold. Mr. Yu believes that the floods in various provinces this year are serious, and that it is urgent to provide relief in this severe winter. He specially visited Mayor Wu and Section Chief Li of the Municipal Government yesterday, expressing his willingness to donate 15 yuan in national currency for the invention rights interest and 10 yuan in national currency for the business profit of each Yu-style Chinese typewriter that he personally invented. From today until the end of February next year, during these two months and more, a total of 25 yuan will be extracted from each unit to be used for flood relief in various provinces. The original price of the machine, 300 yuan in national currency, will be reduced to 255 yuan. He hopes that people from all walks of life will make resolute purchases during this period to do good deeds. It is said that the machine is guaranteed for ten years, and can be exchanged for one-third of the original price after the expiration, not for profit.</p>
<h3>The Chinese and Foreign Relief Association Appeals for Winter Relief for Flood Victims</h3>
<p>The Chinese and Foreign Relief Association on Renji Road has already been providing relief for floods. However, the area of ​​the Yellow River flood has expanded, funds are stretched, and time is long. Now that the weather is severe, the disaster is even more tragic. Therefore, winter relief is urgent. Yesterday, an appeal was made to all walks of life, issuing the following circular: "The drought was suffered in the spring, and the service has just ended. In the summer, before the crops were harvested, the floods came again. At first, the Yangtze River flooded, and then the Yellow River repeatedly reported breaches. As the Yangtze River subsided and the Yellow River rose, the disaster area increased and expanded day by day, and the number of starving people increased. The tragic scene occurred one after another, which is heartbreaking. During this time, the association has exhausted its funds due to the spring relief. Whenever it is difficult to advance or retreat, the directors have to take out their pockets to make up for the shortfall. Now that the disaster has been added to the disaster, how can we bear to see the death and not save it. Fortunately, we have received the enthusiasm of kind people at home and abroad, and have indeed received a lot of help, so we can gradually and reluctantly carry out relief matters. The outbreak started in Hubei, and the first shipment was medicine and cotton. Then, we worked with Jishenghui to provide relief in Tianmen, and then jointly with the Red Swastika Society to provide relief in the disaster area along the Yangtze River, so that we could go from Hubei to Hunan. We also gave priority to Hunan, and the association sent Director Lu Bohong to carry funds to choose Yun to investigate and release funds to supplement the insufficient funds. (Northern Jiangsu) Xu Province has always been poor. This time, the Yellow River disaster was repeated, and the tragic scene was repeated. The association sent President Rao Jiaju to personally inspect and observe. The drought relief office in Peixian had not been withdrawn, so we continued to release flood relief. Moreover, we considered that one relief office could not reach all areas, so we specially established a branch association in Yaowan to provide relief to Pizhou and Suqian. The Yellow River flood extended to the coastal area. On one side, we cooperated with Jishenghui to provide relief in Haizhou and Shuyang. (Shandong) The county established a branch association in Jining, and has provided relief to Juancheng, Yuncheng, Juye, Yutai, Heze, Jinxiang, Dongping, and Shouchang counties. (Anhui), Northern Anhui is suffering from a unique drought. Limited to the amount of cotton, it has been allocated to Huoqiu to choose Yun for relief. (Guangdong) Choose Yun for relief in Sihui, Guangning, and other areas. (Fujian) A Sino-Western committee has been established in Quanzhou to carry out relief work. In addition to the clothes and medicines transported by overseas Chinese and donated by all walks of life, they are all transferred to the disaster areas at any time. This year, we have allocated more than 300,000 yuan in relief funds, and 30,000 new cotton clothes have been sent to the disaster areas one after another. However, it is like a drop in the bucket. Agricultural products have long suffered from being out of season, and it is not known when they will be restored. When the water dries up and people return, they have no clothes, food, housing, or utensils. Moreover, the weather is cold again. If winter relief is not prepared quickly, the previous relief will be in vain. People are the foundation of the country, and food is the sky for the people. Planting seeds must be taken into account. Before the matter has been done halfway, those who are in charge have exhausted their strength and are in a dilemma. Therefore, we have no choice but to appeal to kind people, hoping that those who can give money will give money, and those who can do their best will do their best. Let us gather sand into a tower and gather fur into a robe, and jointly participate in the charity to save the countless starving victims. (If you want to ensure that your children and grandchildren will have a long and peaceful life, quickly give money and rice to relieve hunger and cold) Now is the time, and there is no need to beg,"</p>

<h3>A Homicide Case Caused by Idle Talk Concluded; Li Zhou's Death Due to Beating</h3>
<p>Zhou, the wife of Li Laosan, a Suzhou man who lived in Shantong Cemetery Pier and made a living by boating, was chatting with a neighboring boat woman, Lu, at 12 noon on November 2 this year. The conversation involved the affair between Shen Baogen's wife and the monk Ni San, which was overheard by Ni, who questioned them. There was a quarrel, and Ni, in a fit of anger, gathered Zhang Liu, Monk, Pan Amao, and others to brutally beat Li, injuring her abdomen. Since the woman was pregnant, she died on the evening of the 21st after being injured. Li Laosan reported the situation to the Procuratorate of the Local Court, which sent personnel to examine the coffin. The Public Security Bureau detained the three suspects, Monk Ni San, Monk Zhang Liu, and Pan Amao, and sent them to the Local Court for interrogation. A public prosecution was filed for the crime of Article 277, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law. Judge Lu Hongze was appointed to conduct a trial, which was not concluded. Details have been reported in previous reports. It is now known that this case was again tried by Judge Lu at 11 am yesterday morning. Plaintiff Li Laosan appeared in court to testify about the previous situation, requesting that the law be enforced, and pursuing a private prosecution of 500 yuan. The three suspects, Monk Ni San, Monk Zhang Liu, and Pan Amao, who were in custody, were questioned. The interrogating official obtained a confession and invited Prosecutor Lei Binzhang to court. After the prosecutor made his opinion, the interrogating official considered the case to be concluded and scheduled a sentencing date. The defendants were returned to custody.</p>
<h3>Seized on the Songshan Steamer: Three Human Traffickers and Two Abducted Boys Discovered</h3>
<p>Recently, there have been frequent reports of child abduction in Shanghai's Hunan, Zhabei, and other areas. As a result, investigators Chen Shaoting and Lin Yongfang from the Shanghai Relief Association for Women and Children are diligently inspecting outbound ships to prevent human traffickers from escaping. Yesterday at 11:00 AM, the investigators went to the Laobaidu Wharf in Pudong, as usual, and boarded the Songshan Steamer bound for Xiamen and Shantou. There, they discovered human trafficker Zhao Yunfu (48 years old, from Hunan), and female trafficker Sun Zhangshi (28 years old, from Huzhou), who had abducted a two-year-old boy and planned to sell him in Shantou. When questioned by the investigators, Zhao, knowing he could not hide the truth, admitted that there was also an elderly woman, Wang Zhao, who was also bringing a seven-year-old boy to Shantou for sale. However, Wang Zhao had not yet disembarked. The investigators then notified the water police station, which dispatched detectives Liang Shenqing, Yao Guofa, Shen Changshan, and Qu He Kui. They arrested the human traffickers Zhao Yunfu and Sun Zhangshi, along with the child, and took them to the police station. Investigator Chen waited at the wharf. Later, he saw an elderly woman wandering near the wharf and approached her, asking if she was looking for Zhao. The woman said yes. He then asked where the seven-year-old boy was, and she replied that he was in a snack shop. Knowing that the elderly woman was Wang Zhao (44 years old, from Huzhou), the investigator apprehended her, along with the seven-year-old boy, and took them to the police station. In the afternoon, they were transferred to the local court for interrogation and legal proceedings.</p>
<h3>Rickshaw Replenishment Registration: Municipal Council Has Not Yet Approved; Yesterday, Rickshaws Were Inspected in the Hongkou Area; Those Without Armbands Were Detained and Fined</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Special District Rickshaw Association previously stated that among the registered rickshaw pullers in the Special District, over 40,000 were missing more than 20,000, which meant that the rickshaw companies could not rent out all of their vehicles. Therefore, they negotiated with the Municipal Council to allow for replenishment registration. However, two months have passed, and the Municipal Council has not yet approved the replenishment registration. Yesterday, they began inspecting rickshaw pullers' armbands in the Hongkou area. Those without armbands were immediately detained, and registered rickshaw pullers were brought out, and each rickshaw was fined 50 cents. The association has decided to seriously negotiate with the Municipal Council regarding this matter.</p>
<h3>A Cook's Friend Dies in Confusion</h3>
<p>Mr. Mou, the cook employed by Chen Qingping of 37 Yinheli, Fangbanqiao, Min’guo Road, French Concession, had a friend named Liao, 54 years old, from Chaozhou. He was generally referred to as Old Liao. He was destitute and often sought help from Mr. Mou. Liao was quite honest, and considering he was nearing sixty, Chen Qingping, his employer, felt pity for him being old and without support and often allowed him to eat and stay at his home. Yesterday (the 21st) at 4:30 PM, Old Liao suddenly began rolling around on the cook’s bed, groaning incessantly. The servants suspected he was suffering from heatstroke and immediately gave him "Ten Drops Water" and other medications, but they had no effect. They then called the police station, and the Shan Fire Brigade sent an ambulance to rush Liao to Guangci Hospital. However, it was too late. He was already dead upon arrival at the hospital. The police suspected Liao's death was suspicious and had the body transported to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch Hall on Ningbo Road, pending a report to the Second Special District Local Court for a coroner's examination.</p>

<h3>Robbery Case on Xizang Road: Real and Fake Guns All Present; Zhang Jirong Alert but Suffers; Detectives Arrive Too Late</h3>
<p>Chen Jirong, 21 years old, from Ningbo, resides at No. 73, Lane 246 (Yonghe Fang), North Xizang Road. Yesterday at approximately 6:00 PM, six men suddenly went to Zhang's residence and knocked on the door. When the servant opened the door and asked their purpose, they claimed to be public officials who had received a tip and were there to search for drugs. At the time, Zhang Jirong found the situation strange and, unwilling to be falsely accused, asked them to produce proof of authorization and argued with them. Unexpectedly, they were robbers who, realizing their plan was exposed, immediately pulled out three pistols, threatening Zhang. Instantly, they became menacing, placed the entire family under guard, and assigned an armed robber to oversee them. The remaining robbers swarmed upstairs, dividing into the various rooms and searching thoroughly, turning over boxes and cabinets without leaving anything untouched. After about an hour, they began to come downstairs one after another. Although Zhang Jirong was under guard, he paid close attention to the actions of each robber and discovered that the weapons used by the robbers assigned to guard Zhang and others were counterfeit. Therefore, Zhang Jirong grew bolder and, seeing that the robbers were about to leave, followed them, shouting "Catch the robbers!" Zhang's family also joined in the cries for help. The robbers, realizing the situation was dire, panicked and turned around, firing a shot and fleeing with all their might. Unfortunately, the bullet struck Zhang's left leg, causing him to collapse to the ground, bleeding profusely. The robbers took the opportunity to escape in different directions. By the time the precinct police received the news and arrived, it was already too late. They reported the situation to the police station, who dispatched detectives to investigate and transported Zhang Jirong to the hospital for treatment, while also searching for the robbers in all directions.</p>
<h3>Zhong Baoxin Abduction Case: Trafficker Sentenced to Three Years; One Defendant Admits to Finding Customers; One Defendant Acknowledges Receiving Twenty Yuan</h3>
<p>Five-year-old Baoxin, from No. 35, Lane 640, Huade Road, was playing in front of his door at the beginning of this month when he was abducted by a man from Haimen, who conspired with his friends Qiu Sanbao and Xu to sell Baoxin to someone as an adopted son. After Zhong lost his child, he asked people to search everywhere, but there was no news. He reported the incident to the Yangshupu Police Station. The next morning, detectives Liu Changgen and Su Yinggen apprehended Lu and the other three, and rescued the child Baoxin, bringing them all to the police station. The child was returned to his father, and the suspects were sent to the First Special District Court for interrogation and detention. Yesterday morning, Judge Xiao Xie fen presided over a continued hearing in the Third Criminal Court. Mr. Zhang Shizhu, a lawyer for the Municipal Council, stated that there were no other cases pending and requested that the defendants be severely punished according to the law. When questioned, Qiu Sanbao claimed that Lu Yongchang brought Zhong's child, wanting to sell him, and he did not know that he had been abducted. The rest of his testimony was evasive. Xu Asan claimed that he only acted as an intermediary to find customers and did not go when the child was abducted, pleading for leniency. Lu Yongchang's testimony was cunning and deceptive. The court stated that he had already admitted to entrusting Qiu and Xu to sell Zhong's child, and if they succeeded, he would receive twenty yuan, abandoning the rest. He was ordered not to change his story. Lu Yongchang was sentenced to three years in prison, and Qiu Sanbao and Xu Asan were each sentenced to six months.</p>
<h3>Dentist Situ Bo Found Not Guilty in Lawsuit: Deceased Suffered from Septicemia, Not Caused by Tooth Extraction</h3>
<p>Dentist Situ Bo has a considerable history in the dental profession. Two years ago, he established a public dental clinic downstairs in his hospital to facilitate treatment for ordinary people with tooth ailments. He hired another doctor to handle the medical work at the clinic. In May of this year, Mr. Wu's son went to the clinic for dental treatment and was treated by the doctor there, but it was not very effective. He was referred to another hospital for treatment, but it was also ineffective, and he died. Later, Mr. Wu hired a lawyer and filed a criminal lawsuit against Situ Bo in court. The court has now found Situ Bo not guilty, with the following reasoning: The question of whether the defendant should be convicted of negligent homicide depends on whether the plaintiff's son died as a result of the tooth extraction and whether the defendant should be held criminally liable. According to the plaintiff Wu Juncai's statement, his son Lianfang, 11 years old, went to the defendant for treatment of a painful tooth on May 1st of this year. The defendant extracted a baby tooth. On the 7th, he extracted a decayed tooth, and his condition gradually worsened. On the 13th, the defendant referred him to Tongren Hospital for treatment. The hospital stated that he had septicemia. Disinfectant injections were ineffective, and he died on the morning of the 15th. He believed that this was caused by the defendant's negligent surgery. The defendant stated that the plaintiff's son was treated at the affiliated public dental clinic. After my examination, Dr. You Wenzong extracted a tooth. Dr. You was responsible for all subsequent treatments, and I did not see him. The referral to Tongren Hospital on the 13th was also not done by me. Furthermore, the plaintiff's son had a foul odor in his mouth when he first came for treatment and had a history of toothache and eczema, which could have caused septicemia, and the dentist should not be held responsible. According to You Wenzong's statement at the police station, the child was in great pain when he came to the clinic, and his tooth ailment had probably been going on for a long time. I told the child's family that there was a lot of pus inside a molar on the left side, and the child had a large sore. Surgery was very difficult. We extracted two teeth, a molar, and a baby tooth. At the eighth consultation, we extracted the blood tooth because the child was in great pain. I tried my best to treat the child (as seen in the police station's reply to the court). This proves that the plaintiff's son was treated by Dr. You Wenzong at the public clinic, which is consistent with the plaintiff's claim that the first consultation was personally examined by Dean Situ Bo of the defendant's affiliated public dental clinic. The fact that he changed to Tongren Hospital for treatment on May 13th was also on the instructions of You Wenzong, as stated by the plaintiff during the second court session (November 30th). The defendant did not perform the treatment, so there is no possibility of criminal negligence. Furthermore, according to the Tongren Hospital's diagnostic report, the deceased Pengfang had suffered from eczema and had had toothaches several times in the past two years. This corroborates the defendant's statement that he noticed a foul odor and pus in his mouth during the first examination, and You Wenzong's statement at the police station that there was a lot of pus inside the molar on the left side. This clearly shows that the plaintiff's son had a pre-existing dental ailment, and his condition was quite serious when he sought treatment, leaving no room for doubt. Regarding this point, the defense argued that anyone who has suffered from eczema and toothache may have a hematogenous infection that leads to septicemia and death, and submitted dental medical books written by Professor Fukushima of Tokyo Dental College and Director Kanamori of Tokyo Imperial University, as well as health monthly publications as evidence. After careful review, the evidence is admissible. The plaintiff's claim that his son had no pre-existing illness is clearly untrue. Therefore, judging from the illness, it is also sufficient to prove that the plaintiff's son did not die as a result of the tooth extraction, which is credible.</p>
<p>Based on the above conclusions, the prosecution cannot prove the defendant's guilt, so a verdict of not guilty should be pronounced. Therefore, in accordance with Article 293, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law, the judgment is pronounced as in the main text.</p>
<h3>Brothers of the Fan Family Sue; Detectives Obstruct Freedom and Publicly Insult; Caused by Eviction of Tenants Suspected of Drug Trafficking; Result: Handcuffed and Sent to Police Station Halfway</h3>
<p>Fan Tingzhang, 35 years old, from Zhenhai, Ningbo, the owner and manager of the Laosongmao South Goods Store at the intersection of Huade Road and Jingzhou Road in the Public Concession, and Fan Wenzhao, 36 years old, the owner and manager of the Dalai Ink Factory at No. 12 Chongrang Lane, Fuzhou Road, are cousins. Recently, they jointly retained lawyer Sun Zuji to file a complaint with the Criminal Division of the Second Special District Court, accusing Wang Donglin, a detective from the French Police Station, of illegally handcuffing and obstructing freedom and publicly insulting them on the 6th of this month, requesting investigation. According to the complaint, Zhang Fan, Fan Tingzhang's sister and Fan Wenzhao's cousin, lives at No. 8 Youde Lane, Malan Road. In March of this year, their tenant Yu Xisheng was suspected of drug trafficking. After the police station sent detectives to search, they came to search again on the 1st of this month, but no evidence was found. However, the Zhang Fan family was frightened. On the 6th of this month, they evicted Yu Xisheng. Yu refused and instead gathered his mother-in-law, brother-in-law, and Xiang Tianbao and others to make trouble and use force, resulting in the plaintiffs' niece being injured. The case was sent to the police station for a fine. The plaintiffs, out of affection for Zhang Fan as their sister, went to mediate. Yu Xisheng then gathered hooligans to provoke and quarrel with Zhang Fan. Fearing an incident, the plaintiffs reported to the police station. On the way, the defendant suddenly appeared, handcuffed the plaintiffs without explanation, and took them to the police station. After finding no connection, they were released. The defendant illegally obstructed people's freedom and publicly insulted them. According to the complaint, the court, led by Criminal Division Chief Wang Gangxu, issued summons to the plaintiff's side to appear in court yesterday to investigate the plaintiffs. Fan Tingzhang and his lawyer appeared in court. Fan Wenzhao was absent because of a trip to Hankou. Fan Tingzhang stated that my elder sister, Zhang Fan, and brother-in-law, Zhang Weifang, run the Jinfengtai incense and paper shop on Xujiahui Road and live at No. 8 Youde Lane, Malan Road. Because the tenant Yu Xisheng was selling red pills, my sister evicted Yu after the police station searched the premises. On the 6th of this month, my sister asked Yu's wife when they would move. She replied that if they wanted him to move, they would have to say something nice. Otherwise, he would not only not move but would also refuse to pay rent in the future, leading to a dispute. My niece was injured and later went to the police station, where both sides were fined 50 cents. Later, my sister called me, saying that Yu's side was still going to send people to beat me. I went to advise them that afternoon and then went with my cousin Wenzhao. When we arrived at Youde Lane, we saw Yu's mother-in-law and uncle Xiang Tianbao and others fighting again. Fearing a disaster, I ordered my clan member Fan Xingbiao to go outside and call the police. They were taken to the police station. Unexpectedly, as we approached the tiger stove in front of the intersection of Malan Road and Kangti Road, the defendant arrived with ten others in a rickshaw. When they saw me, they got out of the rickshaw and said I was a hooligan from Hongkou pretending to be a detective, and immediately handcuffed my brother and me. I repeatedly stated that I was a businessman and had not committed any crime and presented my business card for inspection. However, the defendant paid no attention and ultimately handcuffed us to the police station. After confirming that we were indeed legitimate businessmen, we were released. The defendant publicly insulted and obstructed our freedom, requesting an investigation. If there is any false accusation, I am willing to accept the punishment. After verifying the testimony, the court ordered that the hearing be rescheduled for 2:00 PM on the 28th of this month. It is noted that the plaintiffs, in addition to running their businesses, also serve as committee members in commercial organizations and are quite wealthy. They feel deeply humiliated by this unprecedented incident. In addition to filing a lawsuit according to law, they have also sent letters to the clan association and the Chinese Ratepayers' Association, requesting assistance in clearing their name.</p>

<h3>News of a Group Wedding at the Lake Society</h3>

<h3>The Lawsuit Against Zhang Ruizhen's Sister for Disputing the Will Has Been Decided</h3>
<p>Ms. Zhang Ruizhen, a native of Minhou who served in the education sector, had considerable savings during her lifetime. In the summer of this year, she was hospitalized for treatment due to illness. Knowing that she would not recover, she invited her classmates to make a will, stipulating that if anything unexpected happened, all of her property would be inherited by her younger brother, Zhang Xifan. However, before ten days had passed, Ms. Zhang passed away, and Zhang Xifan filed a lawsuit in the local court to validate the will. However, Zhang's eldest sister, Zhang Meizhen, and others accused Xifan of forging the will and should lose the right of inheritance. The siblings sued each other, and Judge Pang Shurong repeatedly summoned witnesses and gathered information to reach a final conclusion. The details have been reported in previous newspapers. Now, it is known that Judge Pang has announced the judgment in this case: In the case of Zhang Xifan versus Zhang Meizhen and others regarding the validity of the will and the loss of inheritance, (Main Text) The oral will of the deceased Zhang Ruizhen is valid, except for the part concerning the loss of inheritance rights of the defendants Zhang Meizhen, Lin Zhang Shuzhen, and Li Zhang Wanzhen. The plaintiff's remaining claims and the defendants' counterclaims are dismissed. The plaintiff shall bear one-half of the litigation costs, and the remaining one-half and the counterclaim costs shall be borne equally by the defendants.</p>
<h3>Yi Fangshuo is Unwilling to Buy the Crime of Extortion; Yi Binzhu Requests Compensation for Damages</h3>
<p>Yi Fangshuo, a Hangzhou native who sings comic opera, was detained by the Second Special District Local Court last winter for a case. His cousin, Yi Baozhu, reported to the French Concession police that Fangshuo had committed rape. Later, because Fangshuo agreed to Baozhu's conditions, Baozhu withdrew the charges. However, after Fangshuo was released from prison, he did not fulfill the previous promises. Therefore, Baozhu has now filed a lawsuit in the First Special District Local Court, accusing Fangshuo of rape, which caused great damage to her reputation, and requesting a judgment ordering him to pay compensation, etc. The case has been tried once, as reported in this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Huang Daxi continued the trial. Because Yi Baozhu was still a minor, her cousin-in-law, Yi Hushi, Yi Fangshuo's stepmother, served as Baozhu's guardian. The court found it necessary to investigate, so Yi Hushi was summoned for repeated questioning about Baozhu's past life. According to her statement, Ningzhu was brought by her uncle and aunt when she was three or four years old. Later, the uncle and aunt passed away one after another, so she was raised by her. Now, Baozhu lives with her godfather. Defendant Yi Fangshuo stated that Ningzhu is the adopted daughter of his fourth uncle. My family thinks that I am currently quite wealthy, so they falsely accuse me of raping Baozhu in order to achieve their goal of extortion. This is a family scandal, and it is truly unbearable to speak of. If I give money to Baozhu because of this case, I am really buying the crime of rape, so I absolutely cannot allow it. Judge Huang then adjourned the hearing to a later date.</p>
<h3>Chen Dimin's Family Has Many Problems; His Wives Have Filed for Separate Residence and Alimony One After Another; Wu Luo'e's More Than 5,000 Yuan Has Been Enforced; Tan Kunfan's Case for Separate Residence Has Been Approved for Postponement</h3>
<p>Chen Dimin, a native of Anhui, who used to be a comprador for a foreign firm and owned real estate in Lafei New Village on Lafei Road, is 44 years old this year and currently lives with his father at 379 Baylor Road. He previously married Tan Kunfan (39 years old this year), a woman from Suzhou, and has been married for 20 years, with six children. They used to live together in their own house at No. 15 Lafei New Village. Later, Chen took a prostitute, Wu Luo'e, a woman from Suzhou and the younger sister of the former first Miss China, as a concubine and lived with her in Dazhong Lane on Tongfu Road. Not long after, Chen had another affair and abandoned Wu. Last winter, Wu first sued Chen for abandonment in the Second Special Court and filed a civil lawsuit for 16,800 yuan in alimony. As a result, the criminal lawsuit was dismissed as unfounded. She filed a separate civil lawsuit, and the first instance ruled that Chen should pay 4,000 yuan. Both parties were dissatisfied and appealed to the High Court. Chen lost the case. Finally, the appeal to the Supreme Court resulted in a final judgment that Chen should pay Wu Luo'e 5,500 yuan for living expenses. 4,200 yuan of Chen's property has already been seized for provisional execution. One wave had just subsided, and another rose again. On February 27 of this year, Chen and his wife had a quarrel and fought, injuring Tan's left eye. Because she could no longer bear to live with him, Tan took her six children and returned to her mother's house at No. 11 Dagu Road in Ningbo. She reported to the French police, filed a criminal public prosecution for injury in the Second Special Court, and also applied to the civil court for mediation for separate residence. Chen also requested mediation for cohabitation. As a result, the mediation on both sides failed. In the criminal case, Chen was fined 30 yuan and given a two-year suspended sentence, and he was ordered to compensate Tan 14 yuan for medical expenses. An appeal to the collegial panel was rejected and the original judgment was upheld. Now, Chen Tan Kunfan has returned to Ningbo with her children, and it has been ten months since her husband, Chen Dimin, has abandoned her and has not provided any support. Therefore, she has retained lawyers Jiang Yiping and Wu Baotai to file a lawsuit for separate residence against Chen Dimin in the civil court of the Second Special Court, requesting to recover the 700 yuan per month for living expenses from March 1 to November, a total of 6,300 yuan, and the 700 yuan per month for living expenses from December 1 onwards, as well as the return of the 3,000 taels borrowed for 20 years, totaling 4,195.8 yuan in foreign currency, and the overdue interest at a rate of 5% per annum. She requested that the defendant be ordered to pay all of the above and that provisional execution be granted. According to the complaint, the court summoned the parties to the Civil Court No. 7 at 3:30 p.m. the day before yesterday, with Judge Li Liang presiding. Both parties arrived with their agents, lawyers Wu Bintai and E Sen. First, the plaintiff Chen Tan Kunfan stated the subject matter of the lawsuit and the reasons for requesting a judgment, saying that her lawsuit was purely for the sake of her children. When questioned, the defendant Chen Dimin said that he was currently unemployed and that the property in Lafei New Village had been mortgaged to Hengye Company for 258,000 yuan, and he was really unable to pay the plaintiff's living expenses. He requested that the plaintiff's lawsuit be dismissed and that the plaintiff be ordered to take her children home to live with him. He had asked relatives and friends several times to persuade the plaintiff to return home, but she refused to return, and he had not abandoned her. The plaintiff said that he lied about not having money. He now has two cars and goes to dance halls every night. He also has a mistress and a small house outside. If he has no money, he can transfer half of the house and land to me. The land in Lafei New Village was originally jointly owned by me and him. Because he was doing mortgage, in order to save his face, I let him mortgage it. The defendant's mortgage will expire at the end of this month. If there is any surplus from the sale in the future, he is willing to give them half of it. If there is no surplus, there is no way. I only have one car, and the other is my father's. Although my father has some property, I cannot use it. Other than that, I have no shares. If any of my property is found, I can give it all to them. She is my wife, and I am very willing to reconcile and live together. The court verified the statements and urged the two parties to reconcile, but the plaintiff insisted on not agreeing, saying that if she lived with him again, he would hit her at any moment, and she was afraid that her life would be in danger. The court held that the plaintiff had not set a deadline for her future living expenses from December onwards, nor had she submitted an amount, and had not paid the litigation fees, so it could not rule on the basis of the above. It ordered the plaintiff to submit a deadline and amount and to pay the litigation fees. After thinking for a while, the plaintiff stated to the court that she would not request this part for the time being and asked for a judgment on the previous nine months and the loan. At this point, the two parties' lawyers stated that they, as agents, believed that the plaintiff and defendant had been married for many years and had many children, and they sincerely hoped that they would each make concessions and requested a reasonable period to conduct a reconciliation outside the court. The court approved the request and adjourned the hearing to January 10 for further questioning, and instructed both parties to conduct a reconciliation outside the court during the adjournment and adjourned the court.</p>

<h3>Recent News on Rent Reduction in Sida Lane; The Landlord Has Agreed to Reduce the Rent, But Some People Are Still Obstructing</h3>
<p>The 140 houses in Sida Lane on Shigaota Road were emptied last month due to rumors. Although things have returned to normal recently, most people are afraid to move in because of the proximity to the Japanese Marine Corps. Those who reluctantly live there cannot easily abandon the premises because they have already spent a lot of money on rent and renovation fees. Since joining the Shanghai Rent Reduction Association last month and formally establishing a branch, they have elected 11 representatives, including Hu, Niu, Gao, Lin, Ye, Chen, Huang, and Weng, to carry out all matters. Initially, they requested two items from the landlord, Hengli Company: rent exemption and rent reduction. Landlord Jiang Yanfang, with deep understanding and righteousness, readily agreed. Other company shareholders also believe that if the rent is not reduced, no one will be interested. Therefore, they sent representatives Zhu and Song to contact the tenants. Unexpectedly, someone is obstructing them. It is heard that all the tenants in the lane have signed one by one, and in addition to refusing to pay the rent, they have submitted a request to the Social Affairs Bureau for mediation and are waiting for a legal solution.</p>

It can be called a perfect combination of Chinese and Western, novel and unparalleled.

<h3>Minutes of the Accountants Association Meeting</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Certified Public Accountants Association held its third board meeting yesterday at its clubhouse at No. 59 Hong Kong Road. The directors present were Wang Sifang, Xu Xu, Chen Riping, Wang Haifan, Qin Kai, Li Wenjie, Dong Chunbiao, Cai Yejang, Wan Ping, Bei Zu, Chen Xianmo, Xi Yushu, and Shen Xuejun. Jiang Wanping chaired the meeting, and the following cases were discussed: The Standing Committee of the Board proposed that any accountant who applies for membership must wait until they start their business, but the board meeting is only held once a month, and they cannot obtain membership immediately, which often causes counties to inquire and urge them, which seems inconvenient. It is proposed to consider a convenient method. It was decided to authorize the Standing Committee to conduct a preliminary review and verification and determine that they have obtained membership qualifications, and then submit it to the next board meeting for ratification. Committee Member Li Wenjie of the Preparatory Committee for the Construction of the Clubhouse reported that they had already purchased land in the New Urban Area in accordance with the resolution of the committee at Shanghai Bank and would sign the contract tomorrow. It was proposed to ask the board to nominate a representative of the association to sign the purchase contract. It was decided to appoint Director Wang Haifan to handle the matter together with the representatives of the Construction Committee of the Clubhouse. (Omitted). It was decided that the association should prepare various draft forms for members to apply for "registration" and "change of registration" and cancellation of "registration" so that members can request them at any time. It was decided to pass the resolution that the association's journal is usually published once every three months. Now, due to the slightly busy association affairs and more documents, in addition to publishing this issue in advance, the future publication will be irregular depending on the amount of information. It was decided to pass the resolution, but it should be published at least once every three months. Director Chen Riping proposed that the association should send new members various relevant accounting regulations and uniform styles, as well as laws and regulations concerning judicial treatment, and print them together so that they can follow them. It was also proposed to submit them to the National Association for deliberation and unified implementation. It was decided to pass the resolution and forward it to the association. Member Wu Ruisen inquired in a letter about holding the position of chief accountant of the public funds and public property management office in Changshu County, but it is an honorary appointment for local finance and is unpaid and does not seem to be on the list of civil servants. It was asked whether to apply for withdrawal from the association. It was decided to reply in a letter that since it is an honorary appointment and unpaid, it should not be subject to restrictions on concurrent positions. (Omitted). It was decided to approve the applications for withdrawal from the association by members Gao Zuying, Xu Chengzai, Hong Zhang, and Jiang Rutang. It was decided to approve the applications for membership by accountants Zhang Genglin and Deng Jiazhen.</p>

<h3>A Visit to the China Pencil Factory (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Huang Youxiong</p>
<p>1.  The Dawn of Domestic Pencils 2. Pencil Manufacturing Materials 3. Key Points of Pencil Manufacturing 4. Pencil Lead Manufacturing Process 5. Pencil Shaft Manufacturing Process 6. Machinery and Equipment 7. Other Products 8. Brief History of the China Pencil Factory</p>
<p>(5) Pencil Shaft Manufacturing Process</p>
<p>The wood used is linden wood, which has already been cut into strips of the appropriate size. Each piece of wood makes up half of a pencil shaft, with grooves cut into both pieces to accommodate the pencil lead. When joined together, they form five pencil shafts. However, this work is not easy, as the initial wood is not very dry and needs to be dried in a drying machine for four to five hours. It is then bundled tightly to prevent warping and unevenness. After being stored in this way for a month, it is sent to a core groove manufacturing machine to create fine grooves. These grooves must be very precise, neither too wide nor too narrow. Once the grooves are in place, the pencil lead is inserted, glue is applied, and the two pieces are joined together. They are then tightly bound and further dried before being planed into a round shape and separated into individual pieces.</p>
<p>The shaft boards, made by gluing two pieces together, are first sawn to remove any uneven ends. They are then sent to a planing machine, where one side of the board is planed into five semi-circular shaft rods. The other side is then planed, combining the two semi-circles into a circular shape, and individual round pencils fall from the planing machine. At this point, they are pencils, but they have not yet been finished or made aesthetically pleasing. Finishing involves polishing the round shape and then applying paint. Polishing is easy, but painting requires at least seven coats, and sometimes up to twenty. The pigments used must also be finely ground beforehand. After painting, a lacquer is applied to give a glossy finish. The ends are then cut off to improve appearance. Finally, the manufacturer's name and brand are stamped on with lead foil, and they are packaged for sale in the marketplace.</p>
<p>(6) Machinery and Equipment</p>
<p>A small pencil goes through such a complicated manufacturing process. Readers will surely find this unexpected. However, despite the complexity, it does not feel strenuous because all the work is done by machines. As long as the electricity is well-managed, it is not difficult. Not only is grinding and pounding done by mechanical power, but the removal of wood shavings from the planing machine and the oiling and air supply for the lead core furnace are all done with automatic devices. Painting is done by machine, printing is done by machine. Everywhere, there are machines. People only need to manage the machines, so what difficulty is there? As a result, although the China Pencil Factory is not large in scale, its daily output can currently reach 50 to 100 baskets, and at most, it can produce 200 to 300 baskets. Its brands currently used are "Airplane" and "Ding." Within the "Airplane" brand, there are also "Little Friend," "Good Student," "Student National Products Year," and "Aviation Room Save the Nation," etc. There is no need to introduce these in detail here.</p>
<p>(7) Other Products</p>
<p>The above description refers specifically to ordinary black lead pencils. At the same time, the China Pencil Factory also manufactures various high-grade pencils. The difference between colored pencils and ordinary pencils is that the former does not use lead but instead uses a glue-based color. The clay used must be extremely fine and is often ground for seven to ten days. After adding the pigment, it is steamed for a day and then rolled. The rest of the process is the same as for making ordinary pencils.</p>
<p>(8) Brief History of the China Pencil Factory - The China Pencil Factory was initiated in the winter of 1933 and preparations began in July 1934. The capital was 50,000 yuan. At that time, the directors of preparation were Mr. Yang and Mr. Mei Zhangweishi. Mr. Wu graduated from Yokohama Higher Technical School in Japan with a degree in applied chemistry and had interned for over a year at the Masaki Yamato Pencil Company in Japan. Therefore, he possessed rich knowledge and experience in this industry. Although the preparation period was extremely rushed, by March of this year, the various machines had been installed one after another. Workers were trained and raw materials were purchased. By the end of June, products were being produced. Because they were entirely domestic goods, they were well-received by society. The factory officially opened on November 8 of this year. From now on, it is hoped that its products will become increasingly refined and its production will increase daily to supply the people of the country and to plug the leaks of the nation. (End)</p>

<h3>Shen Garden Basketball Court Sold Out - Lianghua Defeats McLaughlin by a Large Margin - Score 57-33 - Li Zhenzhong's Wonderful Shots Widely Appreciated</h3>
<p>The Lianghua basketball team came to Shanghai, and in their first game last night, they defeated the McLaughlins by a large margin, 57-33. Li Zhenzhong's wonderful shooting earned him much praise. The team's teamwork was excellent, and their coordination was skilled. They are expected to perform even better against the Pirates. Good basketball games have been scarce in Shanghai recently, so last night, nearly 2,000 people went to Shen Garden to watch the game. The large Shen Garden basketball court was temporarily declared sold out. Lianghua's appeal is evident.</p>
<p>Lianghua's Style Remains the Same - This year's McLaughlins team is much weaker than in previous years. They ranked very low in the YMCA league, so Lianghua's victory was expected. Their defense was weak, and their shooting was poor. They relied solely on Xiang Sheng's individual effort. Lianghua's style was as elegant as ever. Li Zhenzhong's shooting was most appreciated. Liu Zhenyuan seemed to have improved, while Tang Baokun seemed ordinary. The two defenders were exceptionally solid, and Zhang Jingshi was even more impressive. However, the excessive number of fouls last night was a flaw. During attacks, their passing was often too complicated, often resulting in mishaps and missed opportunities.</p>
<p>Tense Situation at the Beginning - After the start, the McLaughlins took the offensive. Xiang Sheng scored under the basket, opening the scoring. Liu Zhenyuan responded with a basket, tying the score. With Pierre's shot, the McLaughlins took the lead again. Li Zhenzhong and Zhang Liangshi scored in succession, but the McLaughlins did not show any weakness. The two teams exchanged points, with the score fluctuating by one point. Lianghua struggled to find a way through. With Griffin's score, the McLaughlins took a 16-14 lead. Fortunately, Li Zhenzhong scored repeatedly, and Lianghua took the lead again, 18-16. The tension of the situation was evident.</p>
<p>Lianghua's Turning Point - The McLaughlins tried to use their tall stature to make things difficult for Lianghua, but it was difficult to succeed. At this time, Huiaide was suddenly substituted for Griffin to play center. From then on, Lianghua found a turning point and soared to new heights. Li Zhenzhong, Zhang Jingshi, and Liu Zhenyuan worked together to increase the score continuously. The McLaughlins remained the same, only scoring one point from a free throw. The result of the first half was 29-17, with Lianghua leading by twelve points.</p>
<p>McLaughlin Collapses - After the Lemon Time, Lianghua exerted its power even more, achieving success with ease. McLaughlin collapsed and could not cope, with the score reaching 50-27, a difference of twenty-three points. Zhang Jingshi and Yin Hongxiang, the two defenders, were both ejected for four fouls, but this could not shake the overall situation. The final result was 57-33, a great victory for Lianghua.</p>
<h3>YMCA Basketball - Qingguang Wins for the First Time - Jinan Easily Defeats Nanxing</h3>
<p>The YMCA basketball games yesterday were uneventful and uninteresting. Qingguang's victory over Shanghai Jiang involved being reduced to three players supporting the remaining game after two people were ejected in the second half, yet they still managed to maintain their victory, with a result of 47 against 36. Jinan, in a dominating situation, defeated Nanxing with 45 against 27. The results and circumstances of yesterday's game are as follows:</p>
<p>Results of Yesterday's Game:</p>
<p>Winning Team - Losing Team - Overall Score - Halftime Score</p>
<p>Huzhong defeated Tongwen (B) - 38 to 14 - 14 to 8</p>
<p>Tax Police defeated Moore (B) - 21 to 18 - 8 to 10</p>
<p>McLaughlin defeated Zhonghua (B) - 60 to 12 - 37 to 6</p>
<p>Qingguang defeated Shanghai Jiang (A) - 47 to 36 - 19 to 15</p>
<p>Jinan defeated Nanxing (A) - 45 to 27 - 34 to 8</p>
<p>Qingguang defeated Shanghai Jiang</p>
<p>In the first act of the Group A game, Qingguang and Shanghai Jiang were evenly matched in skill. During the first half, both teams were equally competitive, with the score difference constantly within a few points, resulting in a score of 19 to 15, with Qingguang taking the lead. During the second half, Qingguang's coordination was more seamless. Han Renxiang and Lu Dazhen repeatedly scored with long shots from the corners, and Shanghai Jiang became increasingly unable to support it. When the score reached 34 to 20, Tong Xiaopei was ejected after committing four fouls. Due to the lack of defenders, they could only fight back with four people. Shanghai Jiang became slightly more active, and after the score reached 45 to 31, Tan Huafu was subsequently ejected. At that time, there were still two minutes left, and Qingguang supported the remaining game with three people, eventually winning with 47 against 36.</p>
<p>Jinan defeated Nanxing</p>
<p>Jinan was beautifully coordinated and accurately shot, and Nanxing was far from their opponent. The score difference was more than half. When Jinan scored 16 points, Nanxing was first scored by Zhong Shimo with a long shot. The first half resulted in 34 to 8. In the second half, Jinan sent out substitute troops, and the situation began to approach. After chasing to 20 to 37, the official team of Jinan took the field again, and Nanxing became unable to support them again. The final result was 45 to 27.</p>

<h3>Municipal Stadium No. 1: Report on Yesterday's Industry and Commerce Football Match</h3>
<p>There were three matches yesterday afternoon at the Municipal Stadium No. 1 Industry and Commerce Football Association. The first was between Youheng and Municipal Earthworks of the German group. The skill level of the two teams was about the same, but due to the strong wind and wet ground, the players found it difficult to display their skills. Therefore, the first half was a back-and-forth affair with no progress. In the second half, Youheng's center forward took a long shot from 35 yards out, which surprisingly hit the mark, causing a loud cheer. In an instant, they broke through the defense again from a corner kick opportunity, creating a 2-0 lead. Youheng won. In the second match, Yingguang played Shudong of the Angle group. Within minutes, Yingguang scored from a free kick long shot. The Shudong goalkeeper was careless and missed the save. In the second half, after switching sides, Yingguang had the advantage of the wind, and their momentum increased. First, the right inside forward charged out diagonally and scored a goal. Then, the left inside forward scored two consecutive goals in the thick of the action, making it 4-0. Thus, the light of Yingguang surpassed the dawn of Shudong. In the third match, Takahashi played Double Ten of the ball group. Overall, the game was extremely intense. The individual skills and teamwork of both sides were quite impressive. The official battle resulted in each team scoring one goal within five minutes. The speed of passing and the skill of shooting were equally matched. Subsequently, the battle intensified, with the attackers exhausting their ability to charge and break through, and the defenders creating deep trenches and high barriers. Ultimately, the strength was equal, and neither side could achieve anything. Until the middle of the second half, when the Double Ten rear guard was resisting the enemy's chaos, Takahashi's center forward flew in alone, breaking through the encirclement. The Double Ten goalkeeper was caught off guard and was ultimately defeated. Thus, the tie was broken, and Takahashi won with a score of 2-1.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Education Orders the Allocation of Disaster and Illness Reserve Funds for Overseas Students</h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 21st) The Ministry of Education has instructed various departments to investigate the fact that provinces and cities should allocate reserve funds for government-funded overseas students and store them in the overseas student management agencies in the countries where the students are studying, to be used for unexpected events such as disaster relief and medical treatment. The Ministry's regulations for studying abroad already stipulate this. Recently, the Overseas Student Supervision Office in Japan reported that some provinces and cities have still failed to comply, making it impossible for the office to deal with urgent educational needs of government-funded students on a temporary basis. Please issue a general order requiring the education departments of all provinces and cities with government-funded students to quickly establish reserve funds. The establishment of these reserve funds is indeed necessary. Provinces and cities that have already sent government-funded students should find ways to allocate reserve funds to the overseas student management agencies in the countries where the students are studying to meet emergency needs. Those that have not yet sent government-funded students should also pay special attention to this when sending government-funded students. This order must be complied with.</p>

<p>Children's Educational Novel</p>
<h3>Little Men (1)(3)(1)</h3>
<p>— Original by Louisa M. Alcott, translated by Zheng Xiaocang</p>
<p>"Once I had a new pair of shoes, and I wanted to show them off; so, although my mother told me not to leave the garden outside the door, I ran away and wandered around all day. It was in the city, and I don't know how I didn't get run over by a car. I was very proud of myself. At first I played with some dogs in the park, then I played with some strangers and boats in the river, ate some fish and sweet potatoes with a red-haired beggar girl for lunch, and finally, when they found me, I was fast asleep on the doorstep of a house, with my arms around a big dog. It was late at night, and I was as dirty as a little pig, and my new shoes were completely ruined - I had walked too much that day!"</p>
<p>"How interesting!" Nian shouted, looking ready to try it out for himself.</p>
<p>"The next day was not so interesting," Mrs. Shu said, taking care not to let her eyes show how much she still longed for the playfulness of her childhood.</p>
<p>"Did your mother beat you?" Nian asked curiously.</p>
<p>"She only beat me once, and even then she asked me for forgiveness, or else I don't think I would have let it go, because it hurt my feelings too much."</p>
<p>"Why did she ask you for forgiveness? - My father didn't."</p>
<p>"Because after she hit me, I turned around and said, 'Your temper is bad. You deserve to be beaten too.' She looked at me, and suddenly her anger was gone, and she said shamefully, 'You're right, Shu, I was angry; I didn't set a good example for you myself, so how can I punish you for being angry? Forgive me, dear, let's see how we can help each other better.' I never forgot this, and it did me more good than ten beatings."</p>

<h3>Finance Gold Price Rises to $1,177 Again Yesterday</h3>
<p>Foreign Banks Suffer Losses, Public Anxious and Fearful</p>
<p>Rumors Abound, Rise of $16</p>
<p>Holiday Break for Two Days Starting the 25th</p>
<p>The gold market had previously declined due to a sudden large supply of foreign exchange, but public sentiment turned uncertain. Yesterday, it stabilized initially but then strengthened. Generally, people are concerned about the continuous disastrous fall of foreign banks. In terms of exchange, adjusting funds seems endless, and changes are likely to occur, causing great anxiety. Large investors suddenly reversed from short to long positions, rumors spread, stimulating heavy buying, and the price finally rose to $1,177, a new high since the currency reform. In the morning, overseas silver markets in England and America both fell. The trading floor still said that the United States was buying 8% of the supply. Deferred silver prices in Montreal rose by 1.3 cents and fell by 4.5 cents. Exchange rates were flat. The price of raw gold in London rose by half a penny. Western newspapers reported that the Central Bank shipped a large quantity of silver to the United States last night, worth between $10 million and $16 million, supposedly to stabilize the exchange stabilization fund. The foreign exchange position is expected to be maintained, and public sentiment remains tired. The Central Bank's official rates were announced, with British and American rates unchanged, and the customs gold unit unchanged. The standard gold price was raised to $1,147.60. Off-floor pre-market trading opened, initially bid at $60, but lacked support and fell to $56-57. Dadecheng and Chunyuan Yong took advantage of the low price to buy in, rising to $58-59. After opening, it stabilized initially but then weakened. Citibank and Chase actively sold, causing the price to drop from over $60 to $56. Japanese banks showed good appetite, and buying activity at low prices provided support. HSBC's official rates were announced, with British and American rates unchanged, and public sentiment was extremely uncertain. Although the price rose to above the $60 mark, due to the erratic supply of large investors, it lingered around $60 for quite some time. The announcement of a silver equalization tax reduction of 2.5 cents had little impact. Later, rumors of the Central Bank opening cash again stimulated buying and caused the price to rise, but it still lingered. Afterwards, public sentiment became actively optimistic. Various favorable rumors circulated on the floor, and the price broke through the $70 mark again. At this point, some selling occurred as large investors took profits, causing a temporary decline. However, buyers kept coming, so suppliers gave in, and another round of price increases began, rising to $277. However, the trend was weaker after the noon session, and there was a decline. The total number of contracts increased to over 13,200, with the long side outnumbering the short side by 25. Future prospects are inevitably subject to change.

There were rumors that the customs gold circulating notes would be issued next Monday at a price of $2.50, and that foreign banks were suffering heavy losses. Although the three banks were working hard to adjust foreign exchange, the future was uncertain, and they would inevitably suffer greater sacrifices later. Rumors arose that the standing committee would change the measures.

Dada Yongli Hengyu Dingkang took profits at high prices, falling to $68.50. Yifeng Yong Fuxing Yong Fuyu bought in again to $71.

<p>The closing price, according to the Central Bank's standard gold price, rose to $1,147.60, but the standard gold surged even more. According to the closing price, it was raised by more than $28, more than $16 higher than the previous close. The accounting price for January is $1,167, and for February, $1,176. The morning supplement was $267. The price of pure gold was reduced by $4, to $1,154.30. The spot market was calm. Refined red metal increased by $1, bought by Yingfeng Heng for about 200 taels.

The deferred swap was traded by Qianchang Xiang, who paid Futai Heng 140 contracts, Jingfu 56 contracts at $8.70, and Yuanmao Yong paid Pulong 84 contracts at $8.80.</p>

By the close, the near-term selling price for British exchange was one shilling, two pence, three-seventy-five, and for American exchange, twenty-nine and a half yuan, the same as the previous close. However, with the removal of forward swaps, both British and American rates softened. Chinese merchants bought more than 600,000 yuan in American dollars, and a small amount of shillings. Among the banks, Citibank had the most active buying and selling. The Central Bank of China also sold. Japanese banks and Siwen Foreign Firms all bought.

<h3>Securities Bond Market Gains from Arbitrage</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange, with the vigorous support of the long side and the assistance of some arbitrage transactions, the market was thriving. The situation has turned around, and there is even a tendency to short squeeze. The Disbandment Public Bonds were first affected by the large-scale selling at 69, and the market price fell sharply by nearly one yuan. Afterwards, new long positions became active, and then each sector immediately followed the upward trend. As a result, the market rose by one jiao compared to yesterday's market, and the forward market rebounded by as much as nine jiao. Other bonds also rose by three or five jiao, even one yuan and three jiao. Looking ahead, there is only one trading day left in the current month's trading, which is next Monday, and a fierce squeeze is inevitable. Reviewing yesterday's events: At the beginning of the morning session, a large number of Disbandment Public Bonds were sold off at 69, and the long side was suddenly subject to a fierce squeeze.

<h3>Yarn and Cotton Prices Soar Amid Rumors of Rising Gold</h3>
<p>The situation in the yarn market is exceptionally acute, with prices soaring. Silver is shrinking, gold is rising, and rumors of issuing more Customs Gold Units, all of which are favorable to buyers. As a result, public sentiment has suddenly become frenzied. The banking sector and other industries have come forward to absorb large quantities, and the trading floor is unusually tight with a lack of contracts, causing market prices to rise higher and higher. Spot yarn prices have soared by four yuan or more. The future of the listed yarn price depends on the fluctuations of the gold market.</p>
<p>Yu's Chicken Brand Soars by Three Yuan and Forty-Five Jiao Listed yarn prices at the opening of the morning session. Due to a slight increase in American cotton by ten points, public sentiment was normal with no special characteristics. Tongcheng Company continued to settle and sold a large amount, but Shenji Yongchang bought in. The China Cotton Company is preparing to take delivery of goods this month, so the market is tight. As a result, prices for each month rose by 1, 2, 5, or 6 jiao. At the opening of the afternoon session, the situation changed drastically. The buying spree suddenly became intense, reaching its peak. Because the standard gold closed at a high price in the morning, rumors abounded in the market. Gengfeng Dachang Fangrun Kang Xincheng all came forward to drag in, and the market jumped horizontally. However, Tongcheng Company's long positions continued to offer, and Ruidi's short positions added leverage, and Yichang also sold, still closing at the peak. The following brands were sold: Dafu 3,350 bales, Dada 2,950 bales, Taichang 1,950 bales, Tonghe 650 bales, Hengyi 600 bales, Yukang 600 bales, Jinchang 1,300 bales, Tongfeng Hua 100 bales, Hengde 950 bales, Yuanyi 650 bales, Yichang 1,250 bales, and Jinkang 1,150 bales.

<p>The cotton market is soaring, and the market is extremely lively. The standard gold has reached a new high again. American and Indian cotton markets are firm. Exchange rates are shrinking, and speculators are active. The banking sector and certain interests are vigorously buying in the afternoon, causing market prices to jump horizontally by 4 jiao to 9 and a half jiao.</p>
<p>Zheng Biao Gengfeng Absorbs Large Quantities Listed cotton prices at the opening of the morning session. The current month was weak due to the pressure of actual goods supply, but the forward market was good due to the overseas cotton market, and the long positions in the financial sector never let go. As a result, the near-term market fell by 5 fen, and the forward market rose by 1 and a half jiao. At the opening of the afternoon session, the rising trend suddenly started, and the momentum was exceptionally fierce. Rumors were circulating in the market, and Gengfeng suddenly came to buy a large quantity. Japanese merchants also bought in, and market prices rose again. However, Tongcheng Company continued to offer, and as a result, prices for each month soared by 4.7 jiao to 8.9 jiao compared to the morning closing prices.

<p>Yesterday, American cotton prices opened higher, as the Liverpool market was favorable. Fellow traders and foreign firms bought, and sellers were few. Prices for each month rose by 6 to 8 points. The market was calm, and most in the industry were observing. Few were hedging, and some short positions moved to the later months.

<h3>Grains Buyers Continue to Enter the Standard Flour Market in the Afternoon</h3>
<p>After the opening of the flour market yesterday morning, prices for each month were generally stable. Foreign wheat quotes were slightly better by one jiao in Chicago and slightly worse by eight fen in the far-term. Canadian wheat was slightly worse by one jiao in both the near and far terms. The market was initially shocked by the unexpected slight decline in foreign wheat, causing both domestic and foreign buyers and sellers to come to a standstill, resulting in sluggish trading and little price fluctuation. However, at the opening of the afternoon session, trading became more active, and the market rebounded by two or three fen. Because standard gold firmed again, internal and external buyers continued to absorb supply, leading to gradually improving sentiment. Currently, the market has little connection with actual sales; the focus of attention is entirely on the price of gold.</p>
<h3>Customers Resell Wheat</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the price of wheat futures fluctuated little during both the morning and afternoon sessions, and trading was also not very active. Because the end of the Gregorian calendar year is approaching, contracts both internal and external tended to be consolidated, leading to a weak market with no vitality. However, industry insiders speculate that without the relief of foreign wheat, it will be difficult to loosen things up for a while. Due to customer resales, the spot wheat market saw prices rise by one or two fen. Shandong wheat was quoted at 4.8 yuan, Nanjing wheat at 4.72 yuan, Jiangbei wheat at 4.79 yuan, and Wenzhou wheat at 4.64 yuan, totaling 1,000 bags, which were bought by Fuxin.</p>
<h3>Selling Off-Season Rice at Reduced Prices</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market for off-season rice continued to be sluggish. As the end of the year approaches, shipments of off-season rice from various regions continued to arrive without end. Even more rice from Wenzhou, Taizhou, and Jiangxi arrived. To sell off their stock quickly, sellers had no choice but to continue lowering prices. Yesterday, local merchants were still interested, but prices dropped slightly by two to three cents. Transactions for rice from Wenzhou, Ningbo, and Jiangxi were active, but rice from Taizhou remained unsold, even with price reductions. A total of 1,500 bags of Wenzhou rice, 1,034 bags of Ningbo rice, 750 bags of Jiangxi rice, and 100 bags of Shashi rice were sold, all handled by local merchants. The supply of foreign rice was scarce and prices were maintained. The outlook for off-season rice remains unfavorable.</p>
<p>Soybeans Firm, Sesame Steady</p>
<p>The soybean market remained firm due to demand for soybean cakes from Xiamen, Shantou, Guangzhou, and inland regions, causing cake prices to rise. With limited supply and stock of soybeans, the market remained robust. Yesterday, four truckloads of Bengbu soybeans and 800 bags of Zhengcheng soybeans were sold to factories. Zha soybeans, Du soybeans, and Ningbo soybeans continued to sell well in the local and Fuzhou markets, but market sentiment softened slightly. Sesame imports have recently decreased, with only 200-300 tons traded, making it difficult for prices to rise. The market price remained around twelve yuan. Consequently, the spot price of raw soybeans remained flat.</p>
<p>Difficult for Du Rice Prices to Recover Quickly</p>
<p>(Shanghai South) Yesterday, the number of suppliers remained at just over thirty (with a total of over six thousand dan of goods). Local sales were average. Although the rainy weather stabilized the market, early Japonica rice prices showed no significant change. However, due to continued demand from Tianjin, 3,000 more bags of Yuan rice were sold, enabling prices to increase by five cents. Du Yang and Jian rice followed suit, and Yin Bian Yuan rice also rose similarly.</p>
<p>(Shanghai North) Yesterday, there were forty-three or forty-four suppliers from various regions downstream. High-quality goods were scarce, with mostly mid-grade rice available. Local white Japonica rice sales were brisk, with suppliers actively restocking. Prices rose by several cents to nearly one jiao. Early rice followed closely, rising by several cents. Thin rice had average demand. Demand from Tianjin was quite active, and prices rose further beyond one jiao. Yangbu Jian rice prices remained stable. White Yuan rice sales were active. Demand from breweries was stagnant. The market was stable. Prices for other types of rice showed a slight upward trend.</p>
<h3>Oil Market: Guide Oil Price Rises by $1.40</h3>
<p>Sesame oil sales were sluggish. The local stock of goods from Henan and Jinpu lines was still around six to seven thousand dan. However, with raw materials becoming extraordinarily expensive, sellers were firm. Since the purchase by the Shao gang, Guide oil was also stimulated, the sale was active. Two hundred cans were sold on previous days, with prices rising sharply to twenty-one yuan, a significant increase of one yuan and twenty cents compared to before. However, with the Lunar New Year approaching, large-scale transactions are unlikely.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Coarse White and Fine White Both Rise by One Jiao</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market continued to trend upward, remaining firm. The guild’s trading floor raised the spot price of coarse granulated white sugar by one jiao, to twenty-two yuan and three jiao. Re-export goods were quite scarce, and the price rose another jiao, to seven yuan and one jiao. Dongchi sugar was sold at seventeen yuan, while ordinary sugar sold for sixteen yuan and six jiao, unchanged. No. 8 white sugar rose by one jiao, to twenty-two yuan. Re-exported YT marks sold at seven yuan and five cents, up five cents. No. 9 white TN sugar was sold at twenty-one yuan and eight jiao and three cents, up nearly one jiao. Re-export goods rose by one jiao, to six yuan and eight jiao and a half. The Zhenji No. 1 fine white sugar from the local factory rose by one jiao, to twenty-one yuan and one jiao. No. 1 sugar sold for twenty yuan and nine jiao, No. 3 sugar for seven jiao, No. 4 sugar for five jiao, and No. 5 sugar for three jiao. Xinchao Qing opened with over a hundred bags of Chongti Zhuang sugar, priced at ten yuan and seven jiao to ten yuan and six jiao.</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn Children's Weekly</p>
<h3>### A Christmas Gift</h3>
<p>— Shouqiu</p>
<p>Dear children, the annual celebration of Jesus's birth, Christmas, has arrived once again! I know that on Christmas night, you will all be expecting gifts from Santa Claus. But that is impossible. Because Santa Claus will never come to your houses! Therefore, you will surely be disappointed in the end.</p>
<p>However, dear children, you don't need to lose heart. Now, I will represent Santa Claus and give you a very precious gift. What is this gift? It is the two words, "Diligence" and "Frugality." If a person can be diligent in their studies and diligent in their work, then their future will surely be very promising. As for the word "Frugality," it refers to thriftiness. A person who is thrifty will be content with prices and will not have thoughts of plunder, or corruption! Therefore, the ancients had the saying, "Frugality cultivates integrity."</p>
<p>Diligence and frugality are the foundations of wealth and honor. Wealth comes from frugality, and honor comes from diligence. Therefore, a family that is diligent and frugal will be prosperous, and a country that is diligent and frugal will be wealthy. However, the habits of diligence and frugality are cultivated from childhood, so I hope that you children will also cultivate the habits of diligence and frugality from a young age.</p>
<h3>Donate New Year's Money to Relief Efforts</h3>
<p>— Shafei</p>
<p>How quickly time flies! Only a few pages remain of the calendar for the 24th year. Yes, that old foreign trickster who specializes in swindling our money is active in the market again. Children! You all know that this scene means that the new 25th year is coming soon.</p>
<p>The annual old custom of sending New Year's cards is about to begin again at this year's end. Children! Perhaps these days you are busy spending a lot of time and money on New Year's cards. True, this is a courtesy, but we must think carefully about whether we can afford to congratulate each other in these times?</p>
<p>At the same time, we must think about this: we are eating our fill and staying warm. But what about the suffering compatriots in the disaster areas? They are hungry and cold, waiting to be fed and rescued! Of course, we children should also fulfill our obligations. Let's save the money for sending New Year's cards and donate it to disaster relief! This, I think, is what all the children are willing to do, right?</p>
<h3>Plant Life in Winter</h3>
<p>— Zhen</p>
<p>The weather is gradually getting colder, and the leaves on the trees are falling one by one. As a result, Min'er has added a lot of clothes. One day, he was thinking, "It's getting cold, and we're all wearing thick clothes. But the leaves on the trees are falling one by one. Aren't they cold?"</p>
<p>"Brother, why do trees lose their leaves in winter? What's the reason for this?"</p>
<p>"When deciduous trees enter winter, they don't get enough sunlight and moisture, so the leaves gradually turn yellow and fall off one by one. As a result, the machinery for making food is gone. Transpiration and assimilation also stop, and the roots completely stop absorbing water, so life is cut off and it becomes a dormant state. This situation is probably because the amount of sunlight and heat decreases in winter. The chlorophyll in the leaves no longer absorbs carbon dioxide from the air. On the one hand, because moisture decreases, the absorption function of the roots also weakens and cannot replenish water, so transpiration stops to prevent the branches and trunk from drying out. On the other hand, the life cycle of leaves is also limited. After the limit is passed, they cannot survive, so at this time, a separation layer forms at the base of the petiole. There is a ring around the outside of the separation layer. The cells inside this separation layer die, so after the wind blows, the leaves fall off."</p>
<p>"Brother, then why don't some trees lose their leaves in winter? What's the reason for this?"</p>
<p>"These trees that don't lose their leaves are called evergreens. They can withstand the cold in winter, and even if the sunlight is not strong, they can still grow, so they still develop as usual, but they grow more slowly than in warm weather. However, their leaves don't stay on the tree forever either. They also fall off after a certain period of time, but on the one hand, the leaves are falling off, and on the other hand, new leaves are also growing, so it feels like the leaves are green and won't wither all year round."</p>
<h3>Worth Introducing Children's Toys</h3>
<p>— Baling</p>
<p>Everyone knows that children's nature is very curious and active, so toys are really their only gift. Every child's favorite toy is as important as their favorite snack. Unfortunately, in recent years, the import of foreign toys has been increasing, causing a large amount of our Chinese money to flow abroad to purchase children's toys. According to customs statistics, the import of foreign toys in one year last year reached a huge six million yuan. Just ask, is this not an alarming statistic? Is this not a frightening number? If we don't find a way to remedy this, then the outflow of money will really be a very terrible crisis.</p>
<p>Now it's good, our Chinese domestic factories also have self-made domestic toys coming out. The factory that created children's toys is the well-known Kangyuan Can Factory, which implements scientific management methods. As far as I know, they have already produced plush toys, including elephants, dogs, horses, monkeys, crocodiles, frogs... and more than a dozen others. Each toy has a mechanism inside, so when the mechanism is activated, it can move like a real animal, which is very attractive. And the price is very cheap, so ordinary families can afford to buy them.</p>
<p>As Student Domestic Product Year is about to end, I sincerely recommend these domestic active toys to all the dear and lovely children, hoping that you children will buy more domestic toys from now on, fulfill your responsibility to promote domestic products for the country, so that you can be worthy of the country, be worthy of society, and at the same time, be worthy of yourselves?</p>
<h3>Keep Hands and Feet Clean</h3>
<p>— Peiyu</p>
<p>Experience tells us that cleanliness is a very effective way to protect the body and prevent disease. Our body must be clean, and our hands and feet must also be clean. Because there are many bacteria and microbes that specialize in transmitting various diseases and destroying human health. These things are so small that our naked eyes cannot see them, but they can be seen clearly under a microscope. They are most afraid of cleanliness, so we must use cleanliness to defeat them and eliminate them.</p>
<p>First, we must develop a simple healthy habit, which is to clean our hands and feet. We must wash our hands with soap and clean water before eating and after using the toilet. It is even better to wash with medicated soap. Fingers, palms, backs of hands, and wrists must be washed clean, especially the fingernails; because in this small area, there can be hidden millions of bacteria, microbes, and other dirty things. Fingernails must not only be cleaned at all times, but also be trimmed often to prevent these harmful disease-causing things from hiding inside.</p>
<p>Our feet should be washed once every night before going to bed. A little salt can be added to the water for washing the feet. In summer, the temperature should be lower than our body temperature. We should pay attention to our toenails as we do to our fingernails, and trim them at least once a week. Be careful when trimming them, and don't cut off too much. It is best to keep the toenails level with the tips of the toes. Cutting off too much can easily cause the toenails to embed in the flesh. Even if they don't embed in the flesh, the tips of the toes will hurt when they come into contact with shoes and socks. As for the socks worn, it is best to use wool or cashmere. Socks made of cotton or silk and cotton blends are not very suitable, because these socks lack elasticity and hinder the development of the feet.</p>
<h3>Fishing Diary</h3>
<p>— Written by Mi Wenhuan</p>
<p>This is a real bird. Oh no! It fell into the fish's mouth. I'll catch it. Great! Great! Only some bones left? No bird meat to eat, but there's fish meat to eat.</p>
<h3>The Words of a Violin</h3>
<p>— Yueqi</p>
<p>My name is Violin,</p>
<p>I am the queen of the orchestra, the most brilliant of the "string" aristocracy. Sometimes I sing the highest note, but sometimes I also act as an assistant. In string music, there are more "firsts" than "seconds." This is different from human life.</p>
<p>My family boasts that I was born from the silver bow of the "God of Archery" Apollo, but others whisper that the seven-string lyre is one of my ancestors! Regardless, I am very faithful: I express whatever emotions people give me.</p>
<p>I first became prominent in Italy. The time was in the 17th century, when opera needed a "highest note lyre" to accompany the high notes. Soon someone discovered that my tone was so beautiful that great music that imitates the human voice could not be complete without me. My wood was carefully selected and kiln-dried; my strings were elegantly arranged; the finest varnish was used to make my body shine; at that time, I was truly never happier.</p>
<p>Thus, in the hands of a musician, I can express all kinds of emotions - mercury-like fluid and continuous melodies, intermittent dance music, vibrating tremolos, gorgeous finger-tapping sounds, heart-pounding vibrato, weeping glissandos, soft harmonies, and other impressions given to people.</p>
<p>However, in order for the human expression to reach the highest level, I must have a beautiful bow. Yes, I pay special attention to my bow, just like a beautiful little girl pays special attention to her beautiful clothes.</p>
<h3>The Great Wall</h3>
<p>— Ding Luzhen</p>
<p>Look at the map,</p>
<p>The Great Wall stands majestically in the north.</p>
<p>It once served as a barrier for our nation,</p>
<p>And also showed the glory of our nation.</p>
<p>Now, ah,</p>
<p>I can't see the sounds of the mountains and passes.</p>
<p>I only hear the barbarian flute everywhere,</p>
<p>Our good defense!</p>
<p>Let the foreign tribes graze cattle and sheep,</p>
<p>Don't even think about keeping it!</p>
<h3>A Three-Dimensional New Year's Card</h3>

But if you go to the store to buy New Year's cards, the cheap ones are not beautiful, and the beautiful ones are very expensive. Now I will tell you how to make a three-dimensional New Year's card. It doesn't take much time, and the cost is very low. The style is both beautiful and very novel. If you send it to your friends, they will definitely be very welcome!</p>
<p>Manufacturing method:</p>
<p>First, take a sheet of drawing paper and cut it into two pieces, "one" and "two," according to Figure A (the size can be determined according to the ratio). Punch a small hole in "one" and cut a chimney "three" and insert it into the hole. Then glue "one" and "two" together. "One" can be left uncolored. Color the walls of "two" in yellow or blue, the door in a lighter shade of yellow or blue, and the window in white or cut it out and paste a transparent thin paper on the back, like a small glass window.</p>
<p>Cut a rectangle from thick and hard drawing paper, and then cut and fold "four" according to Figure E and glue B onto it. In addition, take three or four thorny cypress branches, insert them next to the house, two on each side, as shown in Figure E. The lower part of the cypress branches must be long (as shown in Figure C) so that they can be inserted into the drawing paper (as shown in Figure D).</p>
<p>After the special project is done to the part of Figure E, another piece of thick and hard drawing paper must be prepared, with the upper part colored in azure or light blue - white is also acceptable. Write the words "Happy New Year, Wishing You Progress... So-and-so respectfully congratulates you. So-and-so bows..." in red in advance, and then paste E on it, as shown in Figure G; at this time, most of the project is completed, and only a very important part remains, which is "snowing." The so-called "snowing" is to scrape the chalk into fine white powder with a small knife, and then apply glue (not too thick) to the top of the house, on top of the small trees, and on the ground, and then sprinkle the chalk powder on it to make it stick, so that the snowflakes fall on the house, trees, and ground. However, the glue must be applied evenly, otherwise if it is applied drop by drop, the chalk will be glued into lumps! After making the large paper sheet G, cut a frame according to Figure F with another thick and hard paper sheet and glue it on it to support it so that it can stand on a desk or other things. That way: the work is completed!</p>
<p>After the three-dimensional New Year's card is made, if you want to send it by mail, then you need to prepare a three-dimensional box separately, otherwise you can send it yourself.</p>
<p>Finally, I also want to tell you children a few words, that is, the method I have described is just a very simple one. I hope that you children can use it as an inspiration to create more beautiful and more complex ones! At the same time, I hope to make an animated New Year's card for you next year!</p>

<h3>The Tale of the Righteous Dog (II)</h3>
<p>— Xinqing</p>
<p>The two of them were very poor - extremely poor, often going many days without anything to eat. They really did not have the chance to eat their fill, and when they were able to eat comfortably, it would feel like entering Heaven. However, the old man was very gentle and kind to the child, and the child was pure and honest, and gentle by nature; they were happy when they got a few breadcrumbs or some vegetable leaves, and they had nothing else to ask of the world. In truth, as long as Patrasche was with them, bearing the hardships together, they would be satisfied; if they did not have Patrasche, they would not know what to do.</p>
<p>Because Patrasche was their whole life; their treasure and granary; their gold mine and source of wealth; their Secretary of State and breadwinner; their only comfort and good friend. If Patrasche died or left them, then they would have to lie down and die together. Patrasche was the two of them, grandfather and grandson, their hands and feet; their body and mind; in short, Patrasche was their life, which was their soul.</p>
<p>Because old Daas was too old, and a disabled person; Nello was a small child, but Patrasche was their loyal and strong dog.</p>
<p>It was a Flanders dog - yellow fur, a big head and limbs, wolf-like erect ears, legs and feet very strong, clearly honed from many years of hard labor.</p>
<p>Patrasche's parents were both dogs accustomed to hard work. For a lifetime, they went back and forth on the uneven roads of Flanders, doing the hard and tiring work. When Patrasche was born, he inherited from his parents the idea of only doing hard work for humans. He suffered enough abuse and endured enough beatings, and he could only endure everything. Why? Because it was still a Christian country, and he was just a dog.</p>
<p>From the time it was born, it had not yet grown, and it first tasted the bitterness of leather collars and wooden carts, pulling carts all day long for people to travel. Before it was even thirteen months old, it became the private property of a metal merchant, who routinely ran from south to north; from the green sea to the green mountains. Because it was too small, it was sold cheaply to this merchant.</p>
<p>This merchant was a drunkard and a villain. Patrasche lived in hell every day. Its master was wicked and never cared about its life or death. He often filled his cart with many metal bottles and cans, and made Patrasche pull them desperately, while he swayed his fat body and strolled lazily to the side, smoking his black pipe, stopping to eat and drink at every hotel or coffee shop along the way.</p>
<p>But Patrasche, whether fortunate or unfortunate, was eventually a strong dog, because it was born of an iron-strong race, and could withstand all kinds of tyrannical treatment; so it did not die, but struggled to prolong its painful life under the constant beating, abuse, hunger and thirst.</p>

<h3>The Future Trends of the Media</h3>
<p>— Hualin</p>
<p>The brightness of society often relies first on the majority of upright and impartial media professionals to grind away at its "dark side," and then that so-called "brightness" will leak out a little news, until it reaches the realm of "light shining throughout the universe" and "radiance filling the sky." However, in these times when material desires are rampant throughout the world, most people can only think of benefiting themselves? If one can avoid harming others to benefit oneself, one can already be called a person of noble integrity in society, and few people ask about public welfare anymore. As a result, there is no right or wrong in the world, and black and white are often confused. Looking at today's political situation, economic conditions, and people's lives, the unhealthy aspects of the entire society's exterior and interior, and the dark forces that dominate it, are known to all knowledgeable people and can be spoken of by them. But who is responsible for breaking the "darkness" and pursuing "brightness"? I believe that at least the media should fulfill a part of the responsibility, especially in the current period when "freedom of speech" has been slightly "restored," its responsibility is even greater.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that journalists are uncrowned kings, the authority of public opinion, and their power is enough to deter the monsters in the dark corners. However, only those who can truly be "completely impartial and selfless," disregard "personal interests," and not fear "coercive sanctions" can then talk about the authority of public opinion, and only the doctor in Ibsen's famous work "An Enemy of the People" who is never subdued by power is the character we need in today's era of building public opinion. When those in power are obsessed with the moment, the result can harm the interests of the public, but if public opinion does not point out their misguided path, then the media's sin is actually even greater than that of those in power. For knowingly condoning them, personal dereliction of duty is a small matter, but the impact on society and the country is great.</p>
<p>In the end, public opinion must not only bear the responsibility of "destruction," but also bear the responsibility of "construction." If public opinion engages in "destruction" for the sake of "construction," then it is still worthy of being called "constructive public opinion." It is the duty of the media to add detailed criticism to events that have occurred or been discovered, explain their causes, study their history and environment, and deduce their results, but the main task of the media is to first use their true knowledge and insight to clearly recognize the right and wrong of events, or to use the power of public opinion to suppress them, so as to prevent them before they happen, or to use the power of public opinion to promote them, so that they can be realized. This kind of constructive advice is the highest goal of constructive public opinion.</p>

<h3>Students of Military Academies</h3>
<p>— Gao Bang</p>
<p>More than a decade ago, wanting to wear a military uniform and a weapon belt, and strutting around as a military officer, I enrolled in a military academy.</p>
<p>"Camel Zhao" became our squad leader at that time. He wasn't particularly short, but he had a toad-like small belly sticking out, and his back arched upwards in the opposite direction. So, from behind, his head looked like it was embedded in his chest. This is how he earned the nickname "Camel Zhao."</p>
<p>"Camel's" face, it was said, used to be rosy and fair, quite handsome, but later he became ill due to being greedy with the food rations, so I thought his face looked as thin as a monkey's. His lips were barely enough to cover half of his teeth, and when he spoke, his lips and teeth came together, resembling a Buddha's hand. Therefore, whenever senior officers came to inspect, we couldn't help but laugh when we saw his Buddha's hand-like mouth.</p>
<p>"What are you laughing at? A soldier laughing? Only women and children laugh! Who's laughing again? I'll give them a beating with the board!" He would grumble at us like this when he saw us laughing, and actually using the board to beat us was a common occurrence.</p>
<p>His favorite thing to do was to give lectures, but we all got headaches as soon as we heard he was going to give one. When he lectured, he always repeated the same old lines. We only had to open the "Squad Leader's Lecture Summary" in the duty diary to see that what he said was just the same few points on it: one, absolute obedience; two, proper etiquette; three, neat housekeeping; four, endurance of hardship; five, physical training; six, ...</p>
<p>When we were doing field exercises and he saw onlookers nearby, he would have to give us the most severe lecture. He would become more and more energetic as he spoke, and if your posture was a bit relaxed, or if you weren't paying enough attention to his lecture, he would unceremoniously display his squad leader's authority in front of everyone, rushing over to you and hitting you a couple of times, or striking you on the back with his saber.</p>
<p>His temperament seemed to be naturally inclined to make things difficult for us. Every week, he held at least two rounds of cleanliness inspections and weapons inspections. He never gave people advance notice of when he would inspect, like a cat stalking a mouse, waiting for us to be having fun before suddenly barging in. He would be wearing a pair of white gloves, and as soon as he came in, he would feel the windowpane, squinting with his rat-like eyes. If there was a speck of dust on the white glove, then the student on duty in that room was in for some bad luck. He would either call you over, grab your ear and make you look, or rub the dusty glove on your face:</p>
<p>"Hey! Such clean glass? Good, confinement for a week!"</p>
<p>During weapons inspections, if he found a bit of oil in the barrel or that the cartridge hadn't been ejected, he would either beat you dozens of times with the board or make you kneel for hours.</p>
<p>I remember one week when only two students out of the several dozen in our squad weren't punished.</p>
<p>I lived in the military academy for over a year. Later, at the invitation of a friend, I took up the position of regimental commander in his unit. From that time on, I never heard any more news about Camel Zhao.</p>
<p>Social Science Lecture</p>
<h3>How Relationships Between People Arise</h3>
<p>— Qiu Sheng</p>
<p>When we talk about relationships between people, we easily think of terms like friends, relatives, spouses, siblings, etc., which indicate these relationships. If we ask how relationships like friends, relatives, and spouses arise, the usual answer is also very simple: for example, A and B become friends because they are neighbors or classmates or colleagues, or perhaps they become friends through a chance encounter. As for relationships like relatives and spouses, they naturally arise through marriage, or to put it more plainly, through sexual organs. However, relationships like friends, relatives, and spouses are only superficial relationships between people; and the above answers to these relationships are also very superficial. Everyone knows them, and we don't need to study them. We know that humans are social animals, living in society. The so-called relationships between people refer to social relationships between people; if there are no such social relationships between people, then society cannot be formed, and therefore humanity would not exist, and relationships like friends, spouses, and relatives would not arise. What we want to talk about here is the fundamental relationship between people, that is, how social relationships arise.</p>
<p>Bukharin said, "Society is organized by individuals, which is beyond doubt. Without individuals, there is no society – this is also very clear without detailed explanation. But it should be remembered that society is by no means a simple accumulation of many individuals. The total number of people, adding up Zhang San, Li Si, and many others, is not society. We already know that society is a real sum, a 'system'; we also know that in society, there exists a complex network of diverse interactions between many individuals. Why is this? This is because society is a whole, greater than the sum of its parts, that is, society is not the sum of its parts added together. Whether it is a biological organism or a mechanical object, all kinds of systems have interconnected actions between their internal molecules. For example, a certain machine or a simple watch, if we disassemble its various components one by one and then put those disassembled parts in a pile – that is their total number. But this is no longer a machine, no longer a watch. Why? Because there is no fixed connection here, that is, the various components that form this machine have lost a fixed interaction. How can these components become parts of a machine's whole? Because there is a certain configuration in common. The same is true in society. Society is organized by people. But if these people do not occupy a certain position in the labor process at a certain time, if there is no labor connection between these people in advance, then society cannot exist."</p>
<p>In this passage, it is shown that human beings form society through labor connections; that is to say, social relationships between people arise through labor; labor is the basic condition for social relationships between people to occur.</p>
<p>In fact, whether you like it or not, as long as you still live in society,</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>, you cannot avoid having more or less contact with all the people in society. If you want to eat and wear clothes, you have to have contact with landlords, farmers, weavers, and owners of yarn and cloth factories, as well as merchants who transport and sell goods; if you want to live in a house, you have to have contact with architects, workers, and real estate companies, etc.; even if you need to use the toilet, you have to have contact with the people who empty the chamber pots (those with flush toilets have contact with other people). If all the people in Shanghai who empty the chamber pots stopped working, that is, if the people who empty the chamber pots suddenly stopped continuing their relationship with people who need chamber pots emptied, wouldn't that be a disaster? But so-called farming, working, doing business, and even emptying chamber pots are all labor. Therefore, the above-mentioned relationships are labor relationships, and they are also social relationships between people that arise from labor.</p>
<p>To be more specific, society has a strict division of labor, and all people in society must directly or indirectly participate in the social division of labor in order to survive, that is, all people necessarily live in this social relationship of division of labor and cooperation. Although farmers can farm and produce food such as rice and wheat, they must have workers make farm tools in order to work, they must have civil engineers and stone masons build houses in order to have a place to live, they must have weavers weave cloth in order to have clothes to wear, and they must have merchants transport and sell goods in order to obtain all the necessities of life; similarly, all other groups or individuals must have labor relations with other people in society in order to live. In "Mencius," there was once a Xu Xing who tilled his own land and ate, leading his disciples to Teng State, seemingly independent of human labor relations, practicing self-sufficiency. This seemed so "noble." But in reality, he was not living outside of the labor and cooperation relations of human society. Please see the following interesting dialogue between Mencius and a worshiper of Xu Xing:</p>
<p>"Mencius said: Does Master Xu necessarily plant grains before eating? He said, Yes; Does Master Xu necessarily weave cloth before wearing clothes? He said, No, Master Xu wears coarse clothing; Does Master Xu wear a hat? He said, He does; Who makes the hat? He said, It's made by potters; Does he make the pots and pans by himself? He said, No, he exchanges them for grain; Mencius said, Why doesn't Master Xu weave cloth himself? He said, It interferes with farming; Mencius said, Does Master Xu use pots and pans made by others, and cultivate with iron tools? He said, Yes; Does he make them himself? He said, No, he exchanges them for grain..."</p>
<p>From this, it can be seen that no matter how "noble" or "capable" a person is, they are necessarily living in social relationships between people; and what constitutes this relationship is the division of labor among human beings.</p>
<p>In our society, because of the advancement of labor technology, the greater civilization of society, etc., the social relationships between people are more complex and larger. But this also arises from the division of labor process of human beings. The emergence of trains, ships, airplanes, telegraphs, and wireless radios enables all countries on Earth to exchange goods and communicate news with each other, establishing close relationships among all people on Earth. However, trains, ships, etc., are products of human labor, and the transportation of goods by trains and ships and the transmission of opinions and news by wireless radios, etc., all rely on human labor. Therefore, the expansion of the scope of current world transportation and communication and human relationships relies on human labor. At the same time, due to the advancement of labor technology and the expansion of human relationships, not only can individuals not live independently outside of the labor relations of society, but even a country cannot exist independently outside of international relations. A very obvious fact, such as the League of Nations imposing an economic blockade on Italy, was enough to make Italy suffer. Recently, the U.S. is about to implement a blockade of oil and coal on Italy, which makes the Italian people even more frightened and angry; but this is not all, if all countries in the world sever all relations with Italy, then Italy would be in danger of not being able to sustain itself. What is the reason for this? The final answer is still because the advancement of dynamic technology and the development of industry have made the people of the world have close relations, and have turned the world into one piece, and no one, not even any country, can exist independently outside of this entire relationship.</p>
<p>Of course, we are not saying that apart from labor relations, all other relationships do not exist at all. In fact, relationships like those formed by humans due to similar thoughts and becoming like-minded, relationships formed by harmony of thoughts and temperament and becoming friends, etc., are all commonly seen by us. But we still want to firmly say that these relationships are all appendages of labor relations. First of all, the so-called similarity of thoughts and temperament is not innate, but a product of people's labor life. Only those whose labor life or living environment is similar can have similar thoughts and temperaments, and thus be able to form like-mindedness or friendship; otherwise, it will not be possible. The oil tycoon and the rickshaw puller have conflicting labor relations and different living environments, so they cannot have similar thoughts and temperaments, and therefore cannot be like-minded and friends. This is a fact that no one can deny. Furthermore, if humans do not labor and do not have labor relations, they cannot survive at all, and human society cannot exist at all. Therefore, the so-called like-minded relationship, friendship, and even marital relationship would not occur. Based on this reason, we still want to say that the relationship between people is ultimately caused by labor.</p>
<p>Because the relationship between people is generated by labor, and people cannot live independently outside of labor relations, all human phenomena have an inseparable relationship with us, and we should all strive to understand them. For example, the United States' purchase of silver and the war between Italy and Abyssinia have a great relationship with China's finance, industry, and commerce, as well as our lives, and we should all pay close attention to them. In addition, we should do the same for all other social phenomena, large and small.</p>
<p>Opinion</p>
<h3>On "Freedom of Speech"</h3>
<p>— Zhong Lu</p>
<p>In the Sixth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang and the Fifth National Congress, there was a resolution to "restore freedom of speech." Compared to the period before the "restoration," it is indeed better. However, we hope that the so-called "freedom of speech" is true "freedom of speech," and not "freedom of speech" under the hard to guess "according to law" and "proper"; at the same time, this true "freedom of speech" should also be realized immediately, because this is a problem that the people of China are urgently demanding a practical solution to, and it cannot be resolved by a resolution or a piece of official document.</p>
<p>Now, because the "national crisis" is becoming increasingly serious, there are calls for "sincere unity to jointly face the national crisis" from both the government and the people. The meaning of "sincere unity" here, needless to say, is the "sincere unity" of the people of the whole country from top to bottom or from bottom to top; because only when the people of the whole country are united with one heart can we resist a strong enemy and save ourselves from danger. However, to unite the people of the whole country to "jointly face the national crisis," at the very least, the general public should be allowed to freely express their opinions, they should be allowed to know the current situation at home and abroad, and they should be allowed to freely discuss ways to save themselves from danger. If one side is shouting "sincere unity" while the other side does not allow citizens with opinions to freely express them, and does not allow people who do not know the current situation at home and abroad to know these, then the so-called sincere unity will probably still be empty. Because we believe that at least during the current serious period of "national crisis," every citizen should be given more opportunities to understand their responsibilities, and they should be allowed to freely express their opinions and contribute their abilities in order to jointly save the country and themselves.</p>
<p>At the same time, the "restoration" of true "freedom of speech" can also strengthen our diplomatic power and increase the status of our nation in the international arena. Because if the people of our whole country can freely express their opinions, then it can show the high spirit of our people and the patriotism and self-love of the general public, making it impossible for traitors to forge public opinion to carry out rebellious activities, and making it impossible for aggressors to openly attack the people of our whole country.</p>
<p>Of course, the so-called "freedom of speech" should have considerable restrictions. But we believe that in the current situation, this restriction should be based on the interests of the nation and the general public. Specifically, the absurd remarks of Yin Ni and his colleagues and lackeys, and those remarks that please and flatter the enemy, should be absolutely restricted and absolutely prohibited; in addition, remarks that study all new and old academics, new and old thoughts, remarks that praise or criticize the reality of society, and remarks that express opinions on domestic and foreign affairs, etc., should be given absolute freedom, because only in this way can we show who is right and who is wrong among the various opinions of the people of the whole country, and can we promote the development of our country, nation, society, and culture. We believe that as long as someone does not think that their own thoughts are wrong, as long as someone does not think that their own thoughts must be despised by the people of the whole country, they will definitely not oppose this absolute freedom of speech, because the truth is not afraid of absolutely free discussion.</p>
<p>Recently, the National Government has issued an order to effectively protect public opinion. We hope that the true absolute freedom of speech as mentioned above can be realized immediately; in order to make this hope a reality, we also hope that all publishers, writers, editors of bookstores and newspapers and magazines, and the general public from both the government and the people, should pay special attention to this issue at present, and solve this issue with various effective methods.</p>
<p>Common Sense</p>
<h3>The Role of Fire in Human History</h3>
<p>— From Lu</p>
<p>Fire, this is one of the many great inventions that savage humans gradually completed from the experience of learning to use friction to generate heat. Chinese stories mention Suirenshi drilling wood to make fire, and all primitive savage peoples also knew how to use stone-on-stone methods to make fire. It can be seen that striking stones together to generate high heat for survival was a common knowledge of primitive humans. Of course, humans at that time were blindly using the physical laws of friction to generate heat for production. Therefore, they did not understand that this was a scientific principle, nor did they know that it was one of the scientific discoveries and scientific production activities. However, in any case, the discovery of fire objectively became a great step forward in the development of human physical science knowledge. Therefore, the discovery of fire must occupy a considerable position in the history of natural science because it shows that this physical law has been experienced by humans and that they have been able to utilize this law.</p>
<p>The invention of fire has extremely great significance for human evolution. This is a point that we want to particularly emphasize. First, we can see that the invention of fire has influenced the physical evolution of humans themselves. Before fire, humans' enjoyment of food was limited by the fact that many foods were difficult to split and chop, requiring sharp teeth to easily split and cut food in order to swallow it. This is just like carnivorous animals such as tigers, leopards, dogs, and cats, which must have sharp teeth for easy tearing of meat, while herbivorous animals such as horses, cattle, and sheep must have sharp teeth for easy cutting and chewing of plants. However, since the invention of fire, all foods that are difficult to split and chew can be cooked first to make them easier to swallow. Thus, the function of human teeth has been reduced. Therefore, humans do not need to have the sharp teeth of carnivorous animals to eat meat, nor do they need to have the strong grinding and chewing ability of herbivorous animals to eat plants. Although human teeth have degenerated and shortened as a result, they can eat more diverse foods due to the help of fire. On the other hand, before the invention of fire, humans had to have a very strong digestive ability to digest food, but since the invention of fire, food is pre-cooked with fire to make it a semi-digested product, which is easier to digest. Thus, human digestive organs have also reduced their function with the help of fire, resulting in considerable degeneration.</p>
<p>The invention of fire is also greatly related to the expansion of human food types, because without fire, teeth and digestive organs would have to adapt to certain foods and grow accordingly, which would limit their function. Certain teeth can only be suitable for eating certain foods, so the types of food are also limited. For example, carnivorous animals cannot eat plants and therefore cannot use plants as food, and herbivorous animals cannot eat meat and therefore do not use meat as food. These are very obvious examples. Only humans, with the help of fire, can eat all foods that can nourish them, so their food is particularly diverse and complex. As a result, they can obtain sufficient and numerous nutrients to nourish themselves, which enables humans to evolve and become intelligent and also allows them to have the possibility of fully propagating their species. This is because the quality of food is related to the progress of physical fitness and intelligence, while the breadth and quantity of food types can affect the convenience of the survival of the race, and thus also relate to the question of whether it can propagate.</p>
<p>The invention of fire was probably driven most importantly by the need for meat, but once fire was invented, it further promoted the development of meat-eating life. This development also promoted the expansion of fishing, hunting, and animal husbandry production methods. Therefore, Engels took the acquisition of a meat-eating life as a starting point, saying that it "produced two major results: one is the use of fire, and the other is the domestication of animals. With fire, the process of food digestion is reduced because food becomes a semi-digested substance after being processed by fire. With domesticated animals, there will be a constant source of food, and the milk of animals is no less nutritious than meat. From this point of view, fire and domesticated animals have opened up a path to liberation and progress for mankind."</p>
<p>While fire has very important significance for cooking, it is equally important for keeping warm. In snowy and icy conditions, especially in cold regions, it is difficult for people to survive without fire for warmth. Therefore, even though its role is not as generally effective in keeping warm as the invention of clothing, it is still an indispensable item for residents in cold regions for living at home and overnight. Without fire, humans would not easily survive and reproduce in cold regions. With fire, the area of human survival and residence can at least be partially expanded, and humans can thus have the freedom to migrate and live in extremely cold regions.</p>
<p>It is undeniable that the invention of fire has played the greatest role in the development of human production. This is because primitive humans initially used fire as an important tool for industrial production. Before the invention of metal utensils, the ability of stone tools to dig holes and cut objects was very limited, and felling large trees and building boats could not be done without fire. Savages burned down large trees with fire and also used fire to burn holes to make dugout canoes. Fire can be said to be the only powerful means of production for making primitive transportation tools. If we look at it from the perspective of the industrial development of manufacturing production tools, metal utensils and agricultural tools cannot be forged without fire. The development of finely fired pottery, used to hold water and grains, also cannot be fired without fire. Here, fire has become the driving force to advance humans from the Stone Age to the Metal Age, and the development of pottery also plays a great role.</p>
<p>Naturally, the transition from the Stone Age to the Bronze Age and even the Iron Age has also had an extremely great impact on the progress of agriculture, because the essence of agricultural tools can only be fully developed when they are manufactured with metal. Pottery plays a great role in storing seeds and grains. Therefore, the development of pottery also helps the development of agriculture. However, since the progress of metallurgy and pottery is related to the invention of fire, it is clear that fire also plays an extremely important role in the progress and development of agriculture.</p>
<p>Since the invention of fire required a very long and difficult experience, and its usefulness is so great, savages usually regard it as the most precious and sacred thing, and they strictly guard it and assign special persons to be responsible for its safekeeping. Therefore, this responsibility falls on women, becoming one of the original divisions of labor between men and women. Fire was very rare and difficult to obtain in primitive times, so primitive families gathered around a fire as a center, and the preservation of fire became the center of their gathering. The clan that lived together often regarded the rise and fall of the fire as its fate, so fire was regarded as a sacred object of worship, and the women who kept the fire were also imagined as goddesses in mythology. Hestia became the name of the goddess of fire in ancient times, and the fire in her temple was never extinguished. If the fire in other temples went out, they would go to her to get it. Stealing sacred fire was a sin and would be punished, and welcoming sacred fire also had certain religious ceremonies. The Roman sacred fire was preserved for thousands of years without being extinguished, and even virgins from noble families were chosen to protect the fire and never marry. "If the sacred fire is not extinguished, Rome will not perish" became their common belief at the time. This also proves how much the ancients valued and worshiped fire. Every Chinese family has a stove god, and temples also have so-called fire gods. These are all similar customs. The reason why fire is worshiped to this extent should be due to its great role in promoting human progress!</p>

<p>— Dunru</p>
<p>——Published by Tuwen Publishing House, priced at three jiao per issue——</p>
<p>Because the world situation is increasingly tense, it seems that the smell of gunpowder and blood can be smelled everywhere in the world. Therefore, people living in the current world, as long as they are not muddleheaded "well-fed and doing nothing," are very concerned about current events under this tense situation. In this attention, they not only want to see written records about current events, but also want to see living photos of various figures in current events and concrete living situations of various current events. For example, when the Italian-Ethiopian war broke out, those who generally pay attention to current affairs naturally want to see all the written records of this event. But in addition to this, they also want to see the terrain of Ethiopia, the lineup of the Ethiopian army fighting for national independence, the true faces of Mussolini, Laval, Eden, and other figures, and the cruel situation of Italian planes bombing Ethiopia, etc. Therefore, recently, general political, economic, and cultural magazines and many daily newspapers, in addition to publishing articles explaining current events, have specially published some photos, maps, and cartoons about current events. Needless to say, this is of great help to general readers in understanding current events and recognizing the current tense world.</p>
<p>The recently published "World Military Affairs Illustrated" especially publishes current events, especially military photographs. We can see in it pictures that are sufficient to truly represent the important current events, so that we have a more profound impression and understanding of the current world changes. The publication has stated the reason for its publication in its inaugural speech:</p>
<p>"Countries are deliberately seeking progress in military equipment, and new weapons are invented every day. The mechanization of the army and the use of poison gas death rays will be powerful weapons in future wars. Countries are holding military exercises and air defense exercises, which are heard of every day. Taking lessons from others to seek progress, peeking at other countries' offensive methods, and devising self-defense strategies are something that soldiers should observe, study, and discuss, and the public should also prepare as common sense. Feeling that written records are not easy to popularize and create a deep impression, the World Military Affairs Illustrated is published."</p>
<p>Indeed, in a country like ours where everything is very backward, like our semi-colonial people, we should "take lessons from others" in all aspects to seek our own progress and ultimate way out. If "World Military Affairs Illustrated" really contributes some new scientific inventions, the real situation of the world powers preparing to kill, the terrain of important places in the competition between the powers, the photographs of the oppression of various small nations and their spirit of resistance, etc., according to its purpose, then it is bound to be loved and respected by general readers. It goes without saying.</p>
<p>The inaugural issue of this pictorial is a special issue on the Italian-Ethiopian War. In this issue, you can see various pictures showing the historical background of the Italian-Ethiopian dispute and the British-Italian conflict, Mussolini's ambition to expedition to East Africa, the relationship between the Italian army's actions and the Ethiopian climate, and you can also see the heroic spirit of the Ethiopian people resisting the enemy, a detailed map of Ethiopia, the importance of the Suez Canal, and the military confrontation between Britain and Italy in the Mediterranean. What I think is the most meaningful and difficult to see is several photographs of the Ethiopian people fighting the enemy with their entire families. Just from the facial expressions of these Ethiopians fighting the enemy with their entire families, we can already understand their inner feelings, how angry they are at the brutal aggressors, and how enthusiastic their burning emotions are for national independence. In addition, the explanations of the history, treaties, and current situation of the Suez Canal in words and pictures, the explanations of the geography, history, climate, products, and political economy of Ethiopia are of course necessary for Chinese readers who are not familiar with the situation in Africa.</p>
<p>Naturally, "World Military Affairs Illustrated," like other publications, also has shortcomings. Here we can mainly point out two points:</p>
<p>First, the attitude expressed by this pictorial is a bit unclear. It said in its inaugural speech: "The publication of this journal is in response to the needs of the times. What should be stated is that this newspaper is purely for introducing facts and does not participate in discussion; the materials are all based on sources, and the text is only for explanation. When things involve both parties, it is absolutely in a neutral position;..." In fact, there is no such thing as absolute neutrality in the world. The occurrence of all events in the world has its inevitable causes and possible results, and it has its realistic and great significance. As long as we want to talk about these events, we must have a certain position, otherwise we cannot talk about it; even the introduction of pure facts has a position, otherwise it cannot be introduced. For example, the introduction of the facts of the Italian-Ethiopian War is different from what Ethiopia introduces and what Italy introduces, and the introductions from Britain or France also have their own characteristics: why is this? Needless to say, it is because their respective positions are different. Therefore, we hope that "World Military Affairs Illustrated" will not imagine absolute neutrality, but will clearly stand on a just and upright position to introduce everything and criticize everything. Of course, this just and upright position should be a progressive position that sympathizes with the weak, because if "sympathizing with the violent oppressors, even the wise will become fools," because only by sympathizing with the weak can we gain the resonance of the majority and gain the majority of readers.</p>
<p>Second, because this pictorial imagines absolute neutrality, the text of the current affairs commentary is still too little. I think that although the pictorial should focus on pictures, it should also publish as much text as possible that is directly or indirectly related to the pictures; it is best to have half text and half pictures. Because pictures, especially those rigid photographs, can only give us an impression of the facts, while abstract text can fully express people's understanding of things and critical opinions, so that the general reader can have a clearer and deeper understanding of the facts. The effect of pictures is to give people a concrete and deep impression of the facts, while the function of text is to give people a critical understanding of things with abstract analysis. Pictures and text are both important to us. However, "World Military Affairs Illustrated" has very little text that criticizes and explains current events, and all that is available is short text that "only explains" the pictures: this cannot but be said to be a shortcoming produced by the pictorial being too pictorial.</p>
<p>However, in any case, "World Military Affairs Illustrated" is much better than those pictorials that specialize in talking about decorations to young mistresses and young ladies, than those pictorials that print semi-nude images of "standard beauties," and than those humorous and funny pictorials. Therefore, we still want to introduce to the general readers here: the publication of this pictorial under the current tense situation has its significance, and its content is certainly worth reading.</p>

<h3>Soil-less Cultivation Method</h3>
<p>— Shiyong</p>
<p>T. R. Malthus published the principle of population at the end of the 18th century, saying that "the rate of population increase follows a geometric ratio, while the increase in food follows an arithmetic ratio." His biggest argument is: "...Taking any number of humans in the world as a standard, such as 10 million as an example, after every 25 years, the number will double, such as the ratio of 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, etc., while the proportion of food increase is 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, etc. Therefore, after 225 years, the ratio of population to food is 512 to 10; after 300 years, the ratio of population to food is 4096 to 13; after 2000 years, although food will also increase greatly, the difference between it and the population is almost incalculable by numbers... Looking at it this way, we can see that the power of population increase exceeds the power of the earth to produce human living materials too much." Although the certainty of this theory has been severely criticized by many scholars, the trend of population increase is absolutely true. From Malthus's time to the present, only a hundred and several decades have passed, and this fact has gradually been proven by that principle, although not as serious as Malthus expected.</p>
<p>Since population increase is a fact, it has aroused the excuse of a group of militarists to encroach on other people's land and plunder other people's food, and they also have to say so skillfully: "Civilized people come to take care of the world."</p>
<p>In fact, is population surplus the only way out to take colonies and plunder food by force? No, no, definitely not! This is just a foolish act done by a part of mankind.</p>
<p>Since there is a fact of population increase rate in the world, humans should also think about how to increase food to adapt to the increase in population and to make full use of land.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this task of scientists is by no means understood by a part of mankind. Recently, I received a letter from Tokyo from my friend Zhou Chengyuan, saying, "You can grow things without land." He said:</p>
<p>"The growth of plants only requires the following six conditions: water, air, temperature, nutrients, light, and the absence of growth-limiting substances. Therefore, even without soil, we only need to think of ways within the scope of these six conditions, and it is possible to grow things without land.</p>
<p>This issue has been studied a long time ago. About 236 years ago, the hydroponics method was invented. The so-called hydroponics method is to dissolve the nutrients needed by plants in water to form an artificial plant nutrient solution, and plant the plants in it to make them grow. However, because the initial experiments consumed a lot of money, time, and labor, it can only be regarded as an explanation of a theory.</p>
<p>Recently, Shinichiro Kasuga, an assistant professor at the University of Tokyo in Japan, has successfully tested this method.</p>
<p>Mr. Kasuga began to conduct research in 1929. He first experimented with rice, and the results were almost the same as those grown in ordinary soil. Later, he also cultivated wheat, cucumbers, eggplants, tobacco, peas, broad beans, sugarcane, tomatoes, morning glories, chrysanthemums, cucumbers, watermelons, lychees, soybeans, dahlias, passion fruit, impatiens, pumpkins, peanuts, taro, etc. using hydroponics, and the results were very good, even better than soil cultivation. Even the most difficult radish has been successfully tested. The problem now is how to apply it.</p>
<p>As for the implementation method of hydroponics, it is also very simple. Take a pot, put gravel in it, place the young plants you want to plant in it, and inject artificial nutrient solution. This nutrient solution is changed about every three to seven days. After about fifteen times, it can bear fruit and mature. However, because the plants planted are different, the nutrient solution used is also different. Now I will give an example of one of the nutrient solutions used by Mr. Kasuga's experiments:</p>
<p>Artificial nutrient solution for vegetable cultivation (the amount contained in one liter of well water, tap water, or distilled water)</p>
<p>Raw material medicine Nutritional content Amount</p>
<p>Ammonium nitrate Nitrogen 0.0575</p>
<p>Potassium phosphate Phosphorus potassium 0.0383</p>
<p>Potassium chloride Chlorine potassium 0.0430</p>
<p>Magnesium sulfate Sulfur magnesium 0.01450</p>
<p>Calcium nitrate Nitrogen calcium 0.01170</p>
<p>Ferric nitride Iron 0.01-0.04</p>
<p>A little dilute hydrochloric acid until the PH of the liquid becomes five, five to seven.</p>
<p>According to Mr. Kasuga's calculations, the cost of each pot of this hydroponics method is as follows:</p>
<p>Plant Medicine price Total daily Ordinary fertilizer</p>
<p>Vegetables 0.038 0.010 0.022</p>
<p>Rice 0.010 0.003 0.006</p>
<p>From the above table, it is very cheap economically...."</p>
<p>We hope that Mr. Kasuga's experiments can expand its effectiveness, calm down a few of the cruel hearts that are jumping violently in the world, and reduce a little pain for mankind. This is the only responsibility of scientists to save all living beings.</p>

<h3>Raising the Account Book (8)</h3>
<p>— Puyu</p>
<p>"Hey! Don't pretend to be dead, what are you going to do?"</p>
<p>The old man hesitated for a few minutes before bending his back and approaching me, choking and saying:</p>
<p>"Director Liu, you are still young, please do something good, - understand that I have made no mistakes," he said, arching his hands, "The number you said will really force me to death! Look at this..." He just handed over the account book, then opened the money box, "Look: - if you find 20 yuan, I am willing to be fined a hundred times, a thousand times! The 400 yuan the other day is still paying interest, - 5% interest! Well, well..."</p>
<p>This guy really knows how to pretend to be dead, and even shed tears. But what is the use? I have seen this situation too many times. To be honest, my temperament is a bit strange: the more others say they are poor, the more I always feel they have money. For example, the old man's account book does not have many incoming payments, and there is only a pile of copper coins in the money box, but I suspect that the account book is fake and the money is hidden in the cellar. Really, this is very possible, don't be fooled! Whoever has their throat strangled by me should not even think of taking a breath! (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Silver Jottings</h3>
<p>— Zhi Er</p>
<p>A Viceroy, starting today it is being publicly screened at the Central Grand Theatre. Those who haven't seen it, I hope you go and watch it. At least after watching "The Viceroy," you will know the difference between civilized drama and spoken drama.</p>
<p>According to Chen Gexin, besides the spiritual losses, Chen Dabei still owes him over a hundred yuan.</p>
<p>The monster Shen Xiling, it is rumored that he has decided to depart for Guangxi on the 24th. For the monster's departure, it's good for him to change the air and broaden his horizons. However, speaking from the perspective of the impoverished Chinese film industry, it is ultimately a loss.</p>
<p>Reading the "Kaimaila", I learned that Miss Zhang Wen, who has recently become very popular in the newspapers, has been strongly recommended by Professor Hong Shen to take on the lead role in "Flowers and Grasses" at the Tianyi Company. Although Miss Zhang's performance in "Heroes of the Times" was not particularly amazing, it was quite "competent." In "Flowers and Grasses," I hope she can "fully develop her ambitions." I think this hope is not just my own, right?</p>

<h3>Quick Sketches of Characters in "Spring Flower"</h3>
<p>Gao Zhanfei - A young military officer from a blacksmith's background, with a forthright personality, very fitting to Lao Gao's character. He married Yan Yuexian, a famous courtesan, and they have a daughter. After retiring from the military, he lived in poverty. Yan Yuexian, unable to bear this life of poverty, ran away. Then he lived with Huang Naishuang, worked hard and became rich. He was suspected of murder, fled to another place, and his whereabouts are unknown.</p>
<p>Huang Naishuang - Gentle, shrewd, and capable, she deeply sympathizes with the unsuccessful Gao Zhanfei, even sacrificing her fatherly love to marry Gao.</p>
<p>Yan Yuexian - A flirtatious and lascivious singer, good at dressing up. She first met Sun Min, then married Gao Zhanfei. Because Gao was poor, she eloped with Sun Min. Eventually, she ended up as a street prostitute. When she met Gao Zhanfei again, she was ashamed and committed suicide.</p>
<p>Sun Min - Originally a soldier with Gao Zhanfei, he was good at squandering money, quite like a young master with a fortune. He made a fortune by selling smuggled goods, so he retired from the military and became a gentleman living at sea. He lured Yan Yuexian to elope, but Gao Zhanfei discovered it, and they fought. He accidentally fell to his death.</p>
<p>Wang Xianqi - A ruthless merchant who does all kinds of evil, what Shanghainese call a "loafer." He loves to gamble and is a close friend of Sun Min. After Sun's death, he cohabits with Yan Yuexian. The wealth Yan brought with her was completely squandered, but his greed for money did not die. Later, he and his accomplices went to snatch Yan's young daughter, and was imprisoned for it.</p>
<p>Zhu Qiuhen - A movie star who is good at making trouble. Seeing her gives people a headache. She is the protagonist of the "Love Song Not Intended" in the play-within-a-play in "Spring Flower." When Gao Zhanfei fell into acting as an extra, he was mistaken for the male star she loved, causing many jokes.</p>
<p>Xie Yunqing - Huang Naishuang's father, who is blind. He is kind, but ultimately dies a tragic death.</p>
<h3>Prelude to "Triumphant Song"</h3>
<p>Following "Heroes of the Times", the honorable contribution of Yihua Film Company, the full-dialogue sound film "Triumphant Song", will meet you in major theaters both in and out of the city. Here, we sincerely recommend it to you.</p>
<p>"Triumphant Song" is a passionate poem, a tragic lyrical painting, an exciting bugle call, a movie with a soul and backbone, and also the crystallization of Bu Wancang's year of hard work.</p>
<p>The consciousness of "Triumphant Song" is correct. It grasps the reality, clearly showing a correct path to the drought-stricken countryside, exposing the darkness of feudal forces, dissecting the reasons why local tyrants and evil gentry manipulate the countryside to the point of being terminally ill. The director uses sharp techniques and tense moods to stimulate the audience, emphasizing the inviolable power of ten thousand streams converging to form a great tide. Therefore, "Triumphant Song" not only clearly shows that relief from disaster cannot rely on heaven or gods, but only on ourselves, but also implies that at this critical moment of survival, only the unity of the entire nation can save us!</p>
<p>The script itself has serious significance, plus the technical aspects—such as the arrangement of shots, the magnificence of the pictures, the application of techniques, the expressions of the actors, and the sets and sounds—have unexpected and pleasing results, naturally making "Triumphant Song" perfect.</p>
<p>We are confident that this "Triumphant Song" will not only surprise and amaze you after watching it, but especially will stir up a huge wave in this stagnant film industry—and even in this stagnant China.</p>
