<h3 id="c22">暹羅壓迫華僑問題 <a href="#c22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>— 紀</p>
<p>年來我國旅外僑胞。備受各國政府之壓迫。其痛苦之深。情形之慘。有非我人所忍言者。僑胞之哀嗚。爲報紙所記載者。己爲國人所習見常聞。就近時之情形而論。去年十一月美洲紐傑西州基埠。曾演駭人聽聞之販賣華人慘劇。當時僑胞三十八人。其中僅十八人獲救。同年荷屬直洛崙地方。發生某國漁人。唆使其僱員槍殺我閩籍僑胞黃水員全家之慘案。當時全埠僑胞。莫不憤概。具呈駐棉蘭領館。請求伸寃。嗣經我駐棉領館致函當地官廳要求調查眞相。依法懲兇。日本近亦取締華僑。僑胞之被迫歸國者。迄今已有五十餘批之多。至於暹羅。則其政府。自本年以來。竟不顧中暹兩國歷史關係。進行同化我旅暹僑胞之具體方策。限定自四月一日起。將所有華校開辦之强迫班。盡行取消。凡七歲至十四歲之華僑兒童。均須轉入暹羅學校肄業。專讀暹文。同時並限制華僑工商業。凡華僑商店。必須用暹人一名爲雇員。華僑工廠亦必須儘量安揷暹人。他如高徵營業稅及所得稅等。則猶其餘事。此種手段。一則在以教育之方式。同化我固有之民族性。一則限制工商之自由。以控制我旅暹禍胞之產業。較諸僅僅限制華僑入口。自更嚴重。</p>
<p>茲單就遝羅之情形而論。我國旅暹僑胞。爲數約計三百萬。佔暹羅全國人口三分之一。卽其國內之暹羅本族及老撾族。三分之二以上亦均混有漢族之血。以故就血統關係言。遝羅民族不啻一中華民族。之別支也。依其經濟情形論。則在暹之大小商業。均爲我僑胞所經營尤以米業及木材業爲特甚。暹羅爲一純粹農業國家。每年米之輸出。佔其總輸出三分之二。邇來暹米之輸入中國者。爲數至鉅。兩國之商業經濟關係。亦不可謂不密。我僑胞之在暹米業。有大輾米工廠八十所每所。每年出米約二百二十萬噸。小輾米廠約八百所。每所每年出米約一百二十萬噸。投資總額約達二千萬銖（暹幣）左右。華僑在暹既有如許鉅大之經濟勢力。且具有其固有的和平。忍耐。刻苦等優美德性。故向與暹人相安共處。感情融洽。然自一九三二年革命以後。暹羅民黨執政。狹隘的民族思潮瀰漫國內。於是排華運動。遂頻頻發生。一九三三年十月有暹警無理慘殺華僑之事件。一九三四年二月有限制華僑入口之舉。近且進一步更謀根本同化我僑民矣。我國與暹羅素爲無約國。迄今並無商約之訂定。亦無使節交換。外交上有此缺陷。兩國感情。易爲他人所離間。故吾人甚望當局亟謀補救。中暹商約從速訂立。兩國使節設法交換。以漸進之方式。締結兩國正常之外交關係。同時吾人更希望全國上下。一致限制暹米進口。予暹羅以經濟上相當之刺戟。使彼國朝野知中國方面。非無反響。不能不自動改善其對我僑胞之待遇。誠能如此雙方並進。則我三百萬旅暹僑胞之痛苦。庶可逐漸解除也。</p>

<p>三百萬僑胞將淪為異族　深望政府交涉速訂商約</p>
<p>華僑聯合會昨發表暹羅排華之眞相、及其應付方法、其文云、中暹兩國、在文化上、經濟上、甚至血統上、皆有深切之關係、現在旅暹華僑數　三百餘萬、佔全暹人口四分之一以上、在全世界華僑總數計之、亦佔三分之一、乃中暹兩國、至今迄無正式國交、故暹政府對付華僑、祗有單方之行動、絕無雙方之協商、故排斥華僑之事、時有所聞、迨暹新政府成立、鑑華僑勢力之大、乃决定種種排華政策、頒爲律例、此政策果見諸實行、則華僑在暹不出數年、將無立足之餘地矣、茲舉暹政府排華政策之犖犖大者如下、</p>
<p>新移民律　之頒佈、暹羅第一次移民律、頒佈於一九二七、規定僑民人口、徵收入口稅暹幣五錢、連手續費共六錢五千了、並限制患眼痧者、不得入境、一九九三一年修正移民律、增加入口稅爲十錢、連乎續費十二錢五十丁、外復徵居留稅三十錢、僑民離暹者廠繳回暹護照費五錢、限二年內回暹、逾期作新客論、一九三三年第二次修正移民律、居留費增至一百錢、回暹護照費亦增至二十錢、期限改爲年、並限制不識字者不得人境、最近且有變本加厲之消息、</p>
<p>摧殘華僑　工商業、年來所頒商業條例、對於華僑匯兌業、當押業、舊貨業、手車業、或限制經營、或徵收重稅、最近民黨執政、取締益烈、現在內務部第歷已立、曾草定新經濟計劃、雖未完全見諸實行、但去年五月間、暹政府已計劃設立大現民國營火警並擬將全國火警、卽米業收歸國營、（按暹羅火礱　之經營、華僑佔百分之九十、）此外如新頒定之漁業條例、限制非暹人不能營　、使華僑數萬經營漁業之工商人、遂吿失業、（三）實施</p>
<p>同化政策　一九一八年暹政府頒佈民立學校條例、凡華僑創辦學校、除　向暹敎部立案外、校長須有暹立高中二年資格、華僑合格者甚少、故各校校長、皆以暹人充之、敎員則須考試及格、始能任用、一九三二年、頒佈强迫敎育條例、規定七歲至十四歲兒童、（華僑兒童包括在內）、一律應入義務學校、凡屬華校、則須照例、每週授暹文二十五小時、一九三三年、復規定應受强迫敎育之學生、一律應改人暹校、不得再入華校、至對華校敎昌取締益嚴、除規定須先考試暹文及格外、並塡其履歷書、繳證文憑及打十指指膜以上各項、事實上未施於英法美日各肉所辦學校、去年且藉詞　校敎員暹文不及格、及辦理不善</p>
<p>封閉華校　六十餘家、上列三頃、卽可見一暹政府排華政策、誠有所謂面面兼顧、步步進迫、蓋第一頃之新移民律之實施、則華人入境、每人連船費需華幣二百元、又須識字、以華人赴暹者多數爲勞工、旣多不識字、又無能力負担此重費、試問尙有幾人能　南渡乎、故自該移民律頒佈後、華人入口、大見銳减、即其實證、　於第二項、所謂新經濟政策實施後、則受打擊最大者、爲火戰業、　暹羅火礱業百分之九十皆爲華人所經營、亦可謂華商之最大經濟權、在於火礱、倘火壟收歸國營、無異使華僑之經濟地位、完全消滅、至第一項之同化政策、尤爲毒辣、而‘律以各國外僑敎育價例、亦極</p>
<p>荒謬絕倫　蓋國際上對外僑敎育、未有不准其自設學校、課授本國語言文字者、而暹政府此舉、直次使華僑學校完全關閉、而使數十萬華童、習爲暹人、忘却祖國之文化、其酷毒誠無以逾此、暹羅政府之排斥華僑、事實彰明、此次暹羅遠東觀光圍否認有排華之事、而不敢明言其施行各項律例之眞象、殆知理絀也、所可怪者、我國政府對此三百餘萬之華僑、竟膜不關心、自遜淸百數十年以來、竟不與暹羅訂立國交、任令暹政府孤意批行排斥政策、實爲世界上罕有之現象、在政府方面、或以我國雖屬非正式與暹政府提出訂立國交條約、但政府政諸不理、故迄未實行、其實、中暹兩國、不獨對於偌大之</p>
<p>華僑問題　應謀正當之解决、即就兩國貿易論之、最低限度、亦須有商約之訂立、蓋暹羅政府以產米爲大示、佔出口貨總額百分之五十、而輸入我國爲數最鉅、據暹政府商務廳統計報吿、一一九三三年暹米輸入中國及香港佔其總輸出百分之六十强、一九三四年輸入中國及香港亦佔其總額百分之三十四、是暹米實以我國爲最大銷塲、最近荷印馬來及各地提高入口稅、或限制進口後、繼以日本、又將統制外米進口、暹米已受極大打擊、故現在</p>
<p>暹米運銷　不得不以我國爲其尾閭、即暹羅一般輿論及朝野之有識者、亦皆主張與我國訂立商約、是中國倘能就此一點、以要求訂立中暹邦約、亦非不可達到目的、總之、暹政府排華、已至最嚴重之時期、我政府倘猶顢預遷延、則不獨使二百萬華僑、漸次淪爲異族、而其他各國、相繼效尤、其將何以立國於世界、全國同胞其注意、由賑委會許世英報吿</p>

<p>擴大識字敎育宣傳指示工友奮鬥途徑</p>
<p>本市總工會爲紀念五一勞働節、除召開紀念大會外、並由主席委員朱學範於下午四時、在中西電臺播首演講、指示工人奮鬥途徑、並宣傳勞工識字敎育、語多惕勵、茲錄其演詞如下、諸位同胞、諸位同志、全上海工友、全國工友、今天是五月一日是國際勞動節、是紀念一八八六年美國工人發起的「三八」制運動成功的一日、距今五十年前、美國的工人、受盡資本家的壓迫、嘗够資本家的摧殘、後來實在耐不住資本家的壓迫與摧殘、於是在一八八六年、就有勞動節的發起、要求「三八」制、果然美國的勞工是勝利了、從這一年五月一日起、就實行了八小時工作、八小時敎育、八小時休息的「三八」制、我們要知道要求「三八」制的前一年、即一八八五年美國芝加哥有幾個領導運動的工人、被政府處以死刑、在行刑的時候、他們還大聲的無畏的高呼、「我們在墳墓中的沈默、比我們演說更動人的時候快來了」、我們想他們爲着要謀得工人福利、爲着要求取得大衆的幸福、不惜犧牲熱血頭顱、在刑塲就刑的時候、還是這樣勇敢呼號、慷慨就義、這種視死如歸的精神、實在是値得佩服和效法、今日「三八」制得在世界上大多數的國家能够實行、實在是他們努力的結果、全世界的勞工、爲紀念犧牲的先烈、爲紀念「三八」制的成功、乃是這五一勞動節的紀念、這悲壯熱烈偉大的紀念、我們中國、直至民國七年的今日、才有這個紀念日、才有紀念儀式的舉行、我們的孫總理、即爲首先提倡五一勞動節最熱心的一個、總理爲着要替工人求出路、要替工人謀福利、要解除工人的痛苦和壓迫要救濟全中國的勞動者、於是就努力提倡五一節、努力呼號「三八」制、並發動工人運動、因此中國工人運動得賴此種子而發育、以至於今日之長成、中國的工人運動、我們都知道是以上海的工人運動爲最有歷史、最光榮、最偉大、但是、現在又轉入消沉時期了、我們知道上海之有工人運動、自民國八年五四運動以後才開始、那個時期、算是第一階沒、可稱爲萌芽時期、工人的組織與訓練、奮鬥的精神與力量、都是漸次在發展、到民國十四年五卅慘案發生以後、就踏進第一個階段、我們可稱他爲啓發時期、工人為着反抗帝國主義的壓迫、資本家的剝削、於是自動組織起來、用着堅决的精神、大無長的奮鬥犧牲、造成工人運動的基礎、在民國十六年國民革命軍到了上海後、工人運動就進展到第三階段、那時候可算得是黃金時期、工人的組織與訓練、工人的力量與精神、都充分的表現出來、爲上海的勞工運動史上放　　開了一朶燦爛的花、而爲帝國主義資本家一大勁敵、假如能本此精神進行、將來發展、當日益擴大、但是從民國廿年的「九一八」民廿一年的一一二八」以後、工人運動竟消沉下來、工人福利事實、很少發展、工人的勢力、池就一天一天的低落下來、上海的勞工運動、也就像西山洛日一般暮氣消沉、這是上海工人運動的過程的大槪情形、也可說就是全中國工人運動的進展史蹟、現在全中國的工人運動怎樣呢、上海的工人運動怎樣呢、消沉了、一樣的消沉了、我們看上海的工人、現在是不是實行了「三八」制、是不是生活安定了、這我們知道非但沒有實行「三八」制、就是每天情願做十二小時的工作、也沒有人雇用、情願拿最低工資做繁重工作、也沒有人來睬你、至於生活安定、那更談不到了、這是什麽原因呢、這個我們知道、我國受帝國主義經濟的壓迫侵略、農村經濟破產、工商業凋殘、鉅量入超、現銀外流、以致造成今日之經濟危殆的局面、因是工廠關門了工人失業了、整個的民族整個的國家、都陷落在千鈞一髮的時期、要單獨解決勞工問題、眞是難於上靑天、於是工人運動消沉了、工人無聲息的都靜靜地躺下去了、我們看、號稱我們民族工業的申新紡織公司的第二廠第五廠、到現在還沒有開工、第七廠被滙豐銀行的無理拍賣後、到現在也還沒有解决、帝國主義經濟的壓迫、使我民族工業、全受損傷、像申新這樣大廠家、尙且受不住、其他小資本的廠家商店、自然更是無法挽救了、我們看、許多工廠商店不是自動關門、就是被法院封閉、這種現象、眞使我們痛心、中國現在整個的市塲情形是如此、上海工友、全國工友、那裏還能夠實行「三八一制呢、實在的、在中國目前是談不到、中國的入超自同治八年算到民國二十三年、一共有一百零九萬萬零五百九十一萬之流出去、我們想、六十六年中、有這樣大的數目、眞是駭人聽聞、以中國土地如此龐大、物產如此豐富、人口如此衆多、文化如此淵源的國家、而竟一天一天的只管把錢送到外國去、想不出法子收轉來、弄到現在這個殘廢景象、我們能不悲觀嗎、但是悲觀是沒用的我們要認識形成今日的情勢最重要原因、我們要從這原因上作根本救濟、中國裏危的最大的原因是什麽、就是不識字、沒有受敎育、（未完）</p>

<p>— （季誠性）</p>
<p>人生三部曲小時要奶奶，大時要女人，老時要棺材。</p>
<p>各有所長頭光便於鑽，脚大便於登，手快便於偷，心毒便於處世！</p>
<p>得失因果有了金錢，就有了女人；有了女人，就有了愛情。愛情失了，女人跑了，錢袋也空了</p>
<p>勢利凌人有勢利的人，都由無勢利的人培養而成，無勢利的人被有勢利的人所凌辱，無不心甘意願，君不聞，這種無聊的話：「被××打了耳光也光榮！」</p>
<h3 id="c186">戀愛與麵包 <a href="#c186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>— 胡天宇</p>
<p>愛情是生之波浪。有人生就有愛情，好像是有海就有波浪一樣。麵包是生之維繫。有人生就得需要麵包，好像是魚兒需要水一樣</p>
<p>愛情是精神的食糧，而麵包却是物質的培養。</p>
<p>人們不能失去物質的培養，正像魚兒不能離開水而生活一樣的魚兒離開了水，轉瞬間就能喪失其生存；人們失去了物質的培養，轉瞬間也會使强壯如牛的身軀做了十饅頭饀。</p>
<p>但人們有時却不妨失去精神的食糧，正像海有時不妨平靜一樣。海沒有波浪，雖然失掉了它的活躍，它的偉大，但它究竟不失其爲海；人們沒有精神的食糧的滋補，雖然覺得呆笨，枯燥，但他究竟不失其爲人。</p>
<p>所以，人生不妨沒有愛情，却不能沒有麵包！</p>
<p>何况愛情常常是建立在麵包上面的。沒有麵包，連生命都不能保，更何用說愛情。讓我們來唱現在流行的歌曲：「趕快丟開罷，揉了鮮花，丟了鮮花，關了心花，收了愛的花，忘了他，別想他，解開鎖和枷！」可見，愛情只是銷　枷，它沒有麵包那般有滋味。</p>
<p>現在大衆們所需要的，不是愛情，而是麵包！</p>

<p>— 重樓</p>
<p>我不是科學家，但我還有一個不迷信的頭腦，我不相信「鬼」，因爲我從來沒有見過鬼。</p>
<p>可是最近我却常聽見一種　厲地——像談「鬼」的人所述的鬼呌的聲音了！這種聲音是從警車上和救護車上發生出來的，它有時猛然地在空氣中震盪起來，經過沿馬路的窗前，很響地刺入我的耳鼓。</p>
<p>據說這是警車上一種特別的裝置，可以使路人聞之趨避；也許正因爲它那聲音過於奇突的原故，所以我便把它名爲「鬼叫」。</p>
<p>這怎麽不是「鬼叫」呢？當你聽見那種聲音的時候，你便會知道那是發生了一椿盜案，你立刻會聯想到捕盜格鬬，死傷累累的情形；或者那是發生了汽車肇禍的情事，你立刻又會聯想到邪行人被輾在車輪底下，那斷足折腿，腦流血湧的慘狀；雖然你祇聽見那可怕的聲音，然而你却像是目擊了那可怕的一切。</p>
<p>都市是殺人的地方，這種「鬼叫」的聲音不啻是一種報吿，無論這報吿是屬於那一方面。</p>
<p>不知處在都市的人們，對於這種日漸增多的「鬼呌」聲，作何成想？</p>

<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>依消費的價値和用途而論，襪子當然是比鳳鞋更小的一種東西了，而且無論怎樣會考究的人，也不能在襪子上考究出什麽花樣來；所以宮內還不曾另設一項製襪業，而讓那些製鞋的藝工們負責兼辦。雖然如此，太后對於伊自己所穿的襪子，却一般也是非常的注意，挑剔得很厲害；伊每天必須更換一雙新的襪子，換下來以後，便斷乎不要再用了。在伊的心目中看來，一雙襪子眞和一條線一般的不値錢！可是天地良心，伊的襪子委實也是値錢的！它們的原料是上好的純白軟綢，做工更是十分的講究，做得和伊老人家的尊足再適合也沒有，差不多處處是極服貼的，就是現在我們所穿的絲襪要有這樣的成績，也不容易，何况那時候只憑着人的雙手所做出來的東西呢？</p>
<p>每一隻襪子上，必有兩個合縫，一個在前面，一個在後面；這是因爲軟綢製的襪子，究不如現代的線襪或絲襪一般的富有伸縮力，所以必須在襪統上開出這兩個合縫，不然人的脚將怎樣伸進去呢？可是從美觀上着眼，這兩個合縫畢竟不能不算是一樁大缺陷：太后是最愛美觀的人，當然要竭力彌此缺陷的。於是那些善用針線的藝工們，便給伊想出了一個絕好的補救辦法，就是用各種顏色的絲線，在那兩個合縫旁邊紮出一些特別的花樣來，這樣就把那兩個合縫隱藏過了，倒像也是花樣的一部份。（三〇五）</p>

<p>— 田舍翁</p>
<p>這是吃午飯的時候了：街頭的小飯館，就燒起香噴噴滿鑊的「菜飯」來，白白珍珠般的飯，靑靑鮮嫩的菜，拌了猪油去炒，這便呌做「菜飯」。</p>
<p>一碟排骨，一盌蛋花湯，跟菜飯同吃；這呌做「排骨菜飯」。兩塊大肉，一盌鹹菜湯，跟菜飯同吃；這呌做「四喜菜飯」還有甚麼肉絲蛋炒飯，蝦仁蛋炒飯，肫肝蛋炒飯，大肉麵，鱔糊麵，肉絲炒糕，餛飩……，小飯館都是應有盡有，以供落寫字間的朋友去選擇。</p>
<p>餛飩肉麵這類是「點心」，畢竟難以充飢，常常當作午飯吃的。天天上館子，也非寫字間的朋友，所能勝任。價旣便宜，吃了又飽，要算「菜飯」這種東西了</p>
<p>寫字間的朋友，大多數不供膳宿的。亭子間，擱樓，是他們的公館；吃，又要發生問題了。因爲經濟能力的緣故，不得不跟「菜飯」，發生特別的關係。</p>
<p>吃午飯的時候到了，一個個人從寫字間光降到菜飯店來，便是這個理由。</p>
<p>古人說：「菜飯飽，布衣軟。」吃寫字間飯的朋友，在原則上，萬不能够穿布衣，至少要備上一二套西裝呢。至於吃了這種「菜飯，」飽不飽，可也是一個問題！</p>

<p>— 枕綠</p>
<p>但聽本地人駡人「殺骷顱頭」，精明出名的寗波人駡人「斬頭東西」，其他各地人也多數把殺頭作詛咒語，可見殺頭一事，凡屬有頭的人很少不懷厭惡的心理，會受金聖嘆的狂言「殺頭是天下第一痛快事」的迷惑。</p>
<p>我曾想過，古人定這殺頭的罪刑，大概是發揮消滅生命的作用；可是不問犯罪肇禍的實施者屬於人體那一部份，統歸罪於一顆頭顱而敎它承當償抵，未免獨欺頭部，太不公平了。</p>
<p>我國從前執行斬决罪犯的劊子手，非擅練殺人藝術者不能充當，所以率命殺頭的勾當是視爲專業，也有世襲罔替的。民國以來，這班劊子手失業了，即使有一時期軍閥們不忍眞才湮沒，國技淪亡，有意提拔，恐怕也有才難之歎</p>
<p>從前的監斬官在行刑之後，必往城隍廟拈香，名呌脫影，回轉衙門，又須升登公座，由一班差班皂役手執棍板，吆吆喝喝的趕進趕出，名叫排衙；用意是恐怕那個頭顱殺不當殺，或者陰魂不散，立刻會追上監斬官纏擾討命，所以要煩勞同官—那位陰間當局城隍神—替他把那不知趣的陰魂鎖拿或驅逐。殺了他的頭，又怕他的靈魂受寃尋仇，這種色厲內荏的迷信心理，只有從前的官塲做得出。</p>
<p>如今具有文明外貌的國家，都喜歡標榜人道主義，定律保留死刑而廢止斬罪，並且澤及遺蛻，還定有毀壞屍體的罪名，眞是慈悲之極！奈何世亂不止，當政權者也有以爲治刁民須用峻法，於是殺頭的活劇又在被認爲非常狀態中公開演出，——最近俄國更借材異地，把我國的李某請去，接替前任一個發瘋停職的劊子手的任務，德國也有兩個女間諜一個浪漫女子，最近被政府處以殺頭之刑，可見世界斬刑復活的趨勢，——班被視爲刁民者意外得享殺頭滋味，有嗜殺狂的人們也得在二十世紀消受這夢想不到的眼福。</p>
<p>國民政府成立以前，有一次我往蘇州遊覽，坐在人力車上經過某城門，無意中抬頭瞧見，有兩顆面色如生的人頭高高號令在城門頂上。我又驚詫又憎惡，和別有一種說不出的感慨，勝過了那難得逢到的好奇心理，實在不願多看一眼；沒奈何我的身子只得我那兩顆人頭之下經過進城。此後每逢聽到或看到殺頭的話頭字樣，我的腦海裏必定潛泛起那次蘇州城門上兩顆人頭的印象。我要感謝那位主持殺如號令的官長，給與我這樣深刻不可麼滅的印象，雖然我還無福眼見殺頭時的光景！亞們！</p>

<h3 id="c202">再論彈詞小說 <a href="#c202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>— 寒峯</p>
<p>作一彈詞小說論」後，得李伯元「庚子國變彈詞」，其序引之第一段云：「讀長生殿傳奇矣，至李龜年說開天遺事，激昂慷慨，酣暢淋漓。又讀桃花扇傳奇矣，至柳敬亭蘇崑生說揚州兵變，凄楚入骨，悲憤塡胸。由其大書深刻，筆舌互用，故能遙吟俯唱，聲淚相隨一。彈詞小說，由於演技人之高妙，其感人力量之深遠，於此可見。故彈詞小說，其爲川，實不止於一般彈詞作家所說，祇是「排愁逍悶一，而確有其意義。</p>
<p>彈詞與鼓詞，其形式頗有一些相近，大概在北方，其分別是中簡單的，就是節以鼓則爲鼓詞，易以三弦則爲彈詞。南方的彈詞，雖也受鼓詞的影響，究沒有山歌小唱的成分溶入的重。和曲一樣，在彈詞方面，是也有南北調之分的。不僅此也，又可以分作崑腔，高腔，亂彈，梆梆腔，十排腔，一黃腔，弦子腔，絹腔，囉囉腔，肘鼓子腔種種；這分野，當然是由地域的不同而决定。如十排腔之流行於江南，黃之流行於陝西，弦子盛行於直隸，絹腔囉囉腔之繁榮於河南，肘股子腔之在山東，都是因地而異，無法完全列舉出來的。</p>
<p>關於篇章的組織，最繁複的，包括詩，詞，讚，套數，篇子幾種，而以篇子爲主。所謂「篇子一者，就是篇中彈唱的段落，每一段呌做一篇子；每一回應有　篇子，是沒有固定的。詩和詞，大都是爲着每回的開塲，或全書的結束用。一般的作家，大都引前人之作，其間也分切本事與泛引的兩種；前者以創作的爲多，後者不外於舊籍中隨手摭拾。讚與套數，是適應於特殊的部分，根據事實的必要性而增益，如「燕子箋彈詞」篇末之有「秣陵秋」套數是，當然也可以隨時加入其他體制的作品，如「雙玉盃傳」之有小唱，「雙玉燕傳」之有聖諭，「燕子箋」之有檄文，不過這些，是都可以作爲一種例外。篇子每句的字數，大都以七字十字爲主，其餘的字數，可看事實的必要决定，沒有什麽限制。</p>
<p>篇子寫作的技術，自以韻脚押得自然爲主，還有一種最重要的，也就是更足以帮助彈詞成功的，那就是成語，俗語，以得民間流行的隱語的活潑的應用，可以使篇子更生動，更有力量。如一比似您，這吃不了的甜瓜還恐怕滾，可憐他，那吐不出的苦水却怎生吞；」這運用得多麼自然，又多麼的有意趣。其次，幽默語的應用，也是必要的，這可以調劑聽衆疲乏了的精神。再就原則：說，套子的成功，全靠能在「通俗易解，活潑雅韻」八個字上用功夫。</p>
<p>由於體制的自由，韻白的活用，彈詞小說的優點，除「描狀細物瑣情，無微不至」而外，也還有其他的好處。就是這一種體制，能保留韻文的特長，而又能和散文並用，發展的描狀繪物，以繪影繪聲。同時，也實踐的打破了那俗語土白等等不能入文的傳統觀念，證明引用得適當時，不僅無害，反而使文筆更加活潑，更能給讀者聽衆以一種活生生地印象。</p>
<p>附：澹園論說書四大忌六不可少</p>
<p>「一大忌，是座客廣招欽與環。二大忌，是鄕親漫講票和籤。三大忌，是瞎漢何曾上腔板。四大忌，是主人未必懂絲弦。不可少，石砌磚舖的乾凈地。不可少，夏凉冬暖的爽晴天。不可少，止渴生津的大茶碗。不可少，吃烟點火的小香盤。不可少，童子旋將桌子擺。不可少，丁兒先把櫈兒安。隨乎兒，彈得聲聲似雪亮。字眼兒，吐來箇箇比珠圓。」</p>
<h3 id="c203">論詩歌與音樂 <a href="#c203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>— 陳君涵</p>
<p>詩歌與散文不同的地方最重要的就在詩歌應該有音樂的節奏，音樂的旋律，和音樂的情緒；而散文則無。</p>
<p>記得已往我也談到過關於詩歌中的用語的特殊性和適合於詩歌的思想，以及詩歌的內容與形式的一致等問題了。現在再來談談詩歌與音樂之重要性罷。</p>
<p>詩歌中如果缺乏了音樂的成素幾乎不能成其爲詩歌的。</p>
<p>友人葉君常把他的詩作拿給我讀。最近我又讀到他的他自己滿意的逃荒。委實他是一個對詩歌具着絕大的興趣的人，而且他自己願意要成一個詩人。是的，我是抱着頂大的興致去讀他的詩的。不過，讀後的感覺，不可否認地，他只是把鄉村中的難民受苦的慘狀，向城市逃荒的情景，作爲事實的叙述，分行地如詩的形式寫在紙上而已。它直接所給予我的印象，我認識它只是和一篇散文沒有分別。此外更沒有其他的什麽了。並且那詩中還缺乏着感情的成分。</p>
<p>「詩歌是用文字表達感情的音樂。」我說。</p>
<p>如果要拿這作爲詩歌的定義，自然是偏而不全的。不過，拿它跟散文比，詩歌是包含着音樂的重要的成素。</p>
<p>現在容我引一點詩歌與散文不同的例子來述說吧：</p>
<p>「一個木匠向他的推力（铇子）大概可以這樣說：</p>
<p>「推力，現在我好拿你來削木板了。</p>
<p>但卡遜的詩則寫道：</p>
<p>一推力呵，來疾速地刨削，</p>
<p>板台上颯颯地歌唱；</p>
<p>板兒削得如銅梳般發熱，</p>
<p>木屑滾滾流出來。」</p>
<p>木匠的談話跟卡遜的詩有沒有差別呢？</p>
<p>差別很大的，雖然所談的題目都是一樣。</p>
<p>木匠的話只是簡單的邀請推力來工作，而在卡遜的詩中我們便聽到推力削板的聲音，並且卡遜傳達出了勞動的愉快，勞動的詩意，勞動的音樂。</p>
<p>所以詩歌跟散文的區別就在詩是有音樂的節奏，音樂的旋律，音樂的情緒，而且是寫實的。</p>
<p>有的詩每行的語尾都押有韻脚；不過有的詩是沒有韻脚的，可是描寫的辭句仍是有音奏的，和諧的。</p>
<h3 id="c204">瘋女 <a href="#c204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>— 沈聖時</p>
<p>這少女被深痛的悲傷刺傷了心，她瘋了。</p>
<p>一個瘋子是回復到天眞的，她的傷痛的表情多使人難過呵！</p>
<p>暑假開學的時侯，由父母從醫院送她上美術學校來了。</p>
<p>初上課幾天，她那麼溫靜聰明，我們不知道她是瘋子。</p>
<p>兩星期後，她的不幸的病症漸見地現出來了。</p>
<p>一天的中午，我們瞧見她一個人在甬道上跳着狐步，好些同學去瞧她、她一點不懂不好意思</p>
<p>以後她自己不上課了，常是一個人在音樂室內彈着披亞挪，和着叮咚的琴聲，自家兒唱着悲多汶的哀曲，顫着的沙嗓子，把謌聲從紗窗外透到一湖微綠的春水上了。</p>
<p>隔着牆，我們聽到她毫無理由的狂笑，笑得那麽久，那麽酸心，終於我們聽得她伏在琴的鍵排上哭啦！</p>
<p>她是聰明美麗的，她有音樂的天才，能把英語流順地講話。</p>
<p>我們看見她一個人向着牆壁講流利的英語，零外一次她在廊裏樓着粗大的桂子狂吻。</p>
<p>然而我們不明白她起瘋的原因，一直到她給學校退學之後，她的悲劇於是傳遍學校了！</p>
<p>據說她的未婚夫是美國留學生、學成歸國時，像晴天驟然打下一個霹靂似的，突然地在海船上急症死了。</p>
<p>這深重的刺激襲碎了她的心，這不救的病症，是無藥可醫治的呵！</p>
<p>我離開美術學校，已是第三個年頭，一想那麽一段長日子中痛苦掙扎的生活，當年皂泡似的好夢，像一片薄的春霖樣的消滅了，從此我寂寞地讓生活拖在脚上不抬頭的趕路吧</p>
<p>上帝！保佑我那顆鐵的心，不要瘋狂！</p>
<h3 id="c205">霧 <a href="#c205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>— 流冰</p>
<p>赤道上的淸晨是寂靜而溫柔的。然而，差不多每天早晨，我們開窗一望，都發現了我們四週是包圍着迷濛的白霧，在我們眼前是白茫茫一片，什麽也看不淸，眼前的景色宛如一張走了光的照片。</p>
<p>晨霧遮蔽着一切，使赤道上的一切都掩沒了眞像。但是，在這迷濛的氣氛中，我睜開了我的雙眼，我透視過這白茫茫的烟膜。我看見了毫無虛假的眞實：</p>
<p>那排列成行的橡樹，以往，牠是誇耀着牠們的値錢，但是，現在，我看見牠們强作歡笑地支持着重傷的身軀，牠們在幾十年來供給人們的剝削，而今，牠的血液流完了，瓊漿出盡了，如一個病重的老人，一個錢也不値地被人們丟棄了……</p>
<p>我又看見那閃着灼灼的火光的確山，過去，牠是一座黃金的寶庫，許多人靠這裏過着優裕的日子，而今，礦山荒蕪了，半山的起重機，早已無人過問一，空留着鐵的骷髏磷磷。</p>
<p>在都市中，你看見那些駛奔的卡車，裏面載着闊綽的男女，可是，你看淸一點他們的面部，他們的眼睛是矇着灰暗的憂悒之影。他們的笑中藏着瑩瑩的淚珠，他們在悲嘆着自身的沉沒。……</p>
<p>早晨的濃霧把這一切都遮沒了，人們看不見眞實。整個赤道綫（也許全世界）都被蒙蔽在氛霧中，使人昏迷。</p>
<p>我在窗口想像着一切，我望了望東方的天角，陽光的金綫什麽時候才能衝破這濃霧呢？</p>
<h3 id="c206">雲霓 <a href="#c206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>— 豐子愷</p>
<p>這是去年夏天的事。</p>
<p>兩個月不下雨。太陽每天曬十五小時。寒暑表中的水銀每天爬到百度之上。河底處處向天。池塘成爲窪地。野草變作黃色而矗立在灰白色的乾土中。大熱的苦悶和大旱的恐慌充塞了</p>
<p>室內沒有一處地方不熱。坐凳子好像坐在銅火鑪上。按桌子好像按着了烟囱。洋蠟燭從燭台上彎下來，彎成磁鐵的形狀。薄荷錠在桌子上放了一會，旋開來統統溶化而蒸發了。狗子伸着舌頭伏在桌子底下喘息；人們各佔住了一個門口而不息地揮扇。揮的手腕欲斷，汗水楚還不絕地流。汗水雖多，飲水却成問題。遠處挑來的要四角錢一擔，倒在水缸裏好像乳汁。近處挑來的也要十個銅板一擔，沉澱起來的有小半擔是泥。有錢買水的人家，大家省省地用水。洗過面的水留着洗衣服，洗過衣服的水留着洗褲。洗過褲的水再留着澆花。沒有錢買水的人家，小脚的母親和數歲的孩子帶了桶到遠處去扛。每天愁熱愁水，還要愁未來的旱荒。遲耕的地方還沒有種田。田土已硬得同石頭一般。早耕的地方苗秧已長，但都變成枯草了。盡驅全村的男子去踏水。先由大河踏進小河去，再由小河踏進港汶，末由港汶踏進田裏。但一日工作十五小時，人們所踏進來的水，不够一日照臨十五小時太陽的蒸發。今天來個消息，西南角上的田禾全變黃色了：明天又來一個消息，運河岸上的水車增至八百幾十部了。人們相見時，最初徒喚奈何：一只管不下雨怎麽辦呢？」「天公竟把落雨這件事根本忘記了！」但後來得到一個結論，大家一見面就惶恐地相吿：「再過十天不下雨，大荒年來了！」</p>
<p>此後的十天內，大家不暇愁熱，眼巴巴的只望下雨。每天一早醒來，第一件事是問天氣，然而天氣只管是晴，晴，晴……一直晴了十天。第十天以後還是晴，晴，晴……晴到不計其數。有幾個人絕望地說：「即使現在馬上下雨，已經來不及了。」然而有多數人還不絕望：農人依舊拚命踏水，連黃髮垂髫都出來參加。鎭上的人依舊天天仰首看天，希望牠即刻下雨，或者還有萬一的補救。他們所以不絕望者。爲的是十餘日來東南角上掛着幾朶雲霓，牠們忽浮忽沈忽大忽小，忽明忽暗，向人們顯示種種欲雨的現象，維持着他們的一綫希望。有時牠們升起來，大起來，黑起來，似乎義勇地向踏水的和看天的人說：「不要失望！我們帶雨來了！」於是踏水的人增加了勇氣，愈加拚命地踏；看天的人得着了希望，欣欣然有喜色而相與歡呼：「落雨了！落雨了！」年老者搖着雙手阻止他們：「一喊不得，喊不得，要嚇退的啊！」不久那些雲霓果然被嚇退了。牠們在炎陽之下漸漸地沈下去，少起來，淡起來，散開去，終於隱伏在地平綫下。人們空歡喜了一塲，依舊回進大熱的苦悶和大旱的恐慌中。每天有</p>
<p>塲空歡喜，但每天逃不出苦悶和恐怖。原來這些雲霓只是掛着給人看看，空空地給人安慰和勉勵而已。後來人們都看穿了，任牠們五色燦爛記飄遊在天空，只管低着頭和熱與早奮鬥，得過且過地度子，不再上那些虛空的雲霓的當了。</p>
<p>這是去年夏天的事。後來天終於下雨，但已無補於事，大荒年終於出現。現在，農人啖着糠稃，工人閒着工具，商人守着空櫃，都在那裏等候蠶熟和麥熟，不再回憶過去的舊事了。</p>
<p>我現在爲甚麼在這裏重題舊事呢？我在大旱時曾爲這雲霓描一幅畫。現在從大旱以來所作畫中選出民恂生活描寫的六十幅來結集爲一册書，把這幅雲霓冠卷首，就名其書爲雲霓。這也不僅是模仿關睢，葛覃，取首句作篇名而已。因爲我覺得現代的民恂，始終充塞着大熱似的苦悶和大旱似的恐慌，而且也有幾朶雲霓始終掛在我們的眼前，時時用美好的形態來安慰我們，勉勵我們，維持我們生活前途的一綫希望，與去年夏天的狀况無異。就記述這狀况，作爲該書的代序。</p>
<p>記述旣畢，自己起了疑問：我這雲霓能不空空地給人玩賞，空空地爲人慰勉麽？能滿足大早時代的渴望麽？自己知道都不能。因爲這裏所描的雲霓大小了，太少了。僅乎這幾朶怎能沛然下雨呢？恐怕也只是空空地給人玩賞一下，然後消沈到地平綫底下去的吧。</p>

<p>可是有才沒朝他哥哥望一眼，他只是低下頭，把兩隻赤腳在地上揉，停一會那右脚的大趾頭蹺起半寸多高，像兒子那樣的，用力把另一脚的小腿箝了一下。聽有發說完這些話，才招起頭來釘住門口的哥哥說：</p>
<p>「你老是這些話，我聽都聽得厭了！去做奶媽，自然可以賺一點錢，可是到陸大爺那邊，我就不肯，我們要借他的錢，每月出二分利息，爲什麽一定要媳婦去做了奶媽才肯借？他要自己的兒子好，我難道不要自己的兒子好嗎？我一定不肯，我不高興把孩子貼到人家去，變成猴子那樣瘦得可憐！」</p>
<p>「我想也沒有什麽狠心的，他們用的那個奶媽不好，奶水少，你媳婦年紀輕，奶又多，他們自然中意了。正好我們又要向他借錢，怕我們不肯，才這麼要我們先答應的。」有發一雙眼睛」忽兒釘在地上，一忽兒釘在有才臉上，好似也埋怨着自己太多話的樣子。</p>
<p>「你那裏知道？他們的心最狠，他好像二分息還嫌小，故意要爲難我們，我就不服氣！」</p>
<p>有才把聲音也提得高了起來，看見他哥哥不接話，又說道：</p>
<p>「你是一看見陸大爺的影子都怕的，年紀比我大十來歲，膽却只有芝蔴那麽大。怕他們什麽？越怕他們，他們越放肆，我現在是看透的了。」</p>
<p>「看透，我不信你看透，你是聽了胡永良的鬼話才變成這樣的。」哥寄似乎生一點氣，把那雙絡滿紅絲的眼，用力看着有才的臉。好像在問着：你能不能抵賴我這發見？停一會又低了聲音說：「有才，你不要去學胡永良的樣吧，這小子在城裏住了兩年，什麼人都不在他眼裏了，我看他一定沒有好結果，你不要學他。」</p>
<p>有才沒說話，那張給太陽晒成醬色的臉上，兩個顴骨一抽一抽地動着。這時候屋角那柴窠裏的孩子，猛的哭了起來，眼前這憂鬱的沉默，給這淸脆的哭聲衝破了，兩人都鬆了一口氣。隔壁灶間裏一個黑圓臉子的女人走來，抱起孩子又忽忽地走了。</p>
<p>「你答應了吧，有才，快不要說那些負氣的話，我們窮人是不能這樣的。！」有發換了柔和的聲氣，走到桌子前邊拿了隻水烟袋，那樣子要跟有才談上半天似的。</p>
<p>「不要說這些空話，我只對你講，她走了家裏也不行，我們兩個人忙着到田裏做，屋裏燒飯那些事誰去幹？飯那些事誰去幹？去年嫂嫂到城裏去做活，你自己說阿根的娘不能去，家裏留個巴女人是有用的。你現在又這樣說了，眞是——」</p>

<p>— 家為</p>
<p>「修福修壽，多子多孫」，這本是在我們古老的封建社會裏底一句俗語——不，是一句「口頭禪」呢！上至在賀壽道喜時侯的親戚朋家們口里，下而甚至在跟着人求施的乞丐嘴裏，都得用着牠的。</p>
<p>果然，自從「歐風漸東」，尤其是「五四」以來，我們的社會是有點「維新」了。同時，更為着今日年頭的不景氣，社會的不太平吧？許多許多人民的生活都逐漸感到了困難，發生了恐慌，而跑上了飢寒交迫，生死存亡的戰綫上去掙扎，這樣，這句「修福修壽，多子多孫」的「吉利話」。在今日似乎要受到種威脅，而不够再「上下通行」着吧？</p>
<p>至於講到西歐諸「文明國家」，當然要比我們「開化」得多，那末，這種封建念頭的早已剷除，是亳無異議的了？而且，在當前，牠們這羣資本帝國主義國家大家正登上了「恐慌」的極高峰；「獨佔勢力的一天膨脹一天，而失業恐慌與矛盾的衝突一天擴大一天；所以，「多子多孫」之於他們，也正得感受着困難與威脅的吧？</p>
<p>不過，事實却正相反，請前日各報載有國民社羅馬電：「意大利今日成為密月國，蓋有二千對以上之新婚夫婦，由法西斯黨供給費用，共度假日也。新婚夫婦，每對可得五百呂；此係政府獎勵結婚計劃中之一部。」又路透社電有：「昨日羅馬共有二千三百五十三對男女行結婚禮，蓋遵行法西斯「早婚」與「大家庭」之標語也。新夫婦大都年不滿二十五歲，且有若干，年僅十六者。」</p>
<p>看吧！「早婚」，「大家庭」，「年僅十六者」，「二千三百五十三對男女」，真是「浩浩蕩蕩」，「空前絕後」，然為的是——「早生貴子」！</p>
<p>記得在前月的報上，曾讀到過這麽一個統計：「據國社黨種族部統計，一九三四年德國結婚起歡，仍保有各國未有之紀錄，去牟上半年德人結婚，共有三三四·六〇〇起，較一九三三年同時期，增加百分之三十二。生產率亦以德國佔第一位，去年全年共出生五七六·八〇〇人。又據勞工陣綫團機關報「德國人報」評論，謂人口增加之競賽，須繼續舉行，子女眾多之家庭，應予以補助。」</p>
<p>可是。在他們所謂「獎勸結婚」，「人口增加之競賽，須繼續舉行」，却並不為着「修福修壽」的啦！要是我們注意一下今日各國正鼓吹着的「重整軍備」，「增加國防預算」，「添造新艦」，「戰雲日緊，各國屯積小麥」等等消息，那就不難明白：他們這樣的「計劃」，「紀錄」，是有看怎樣的作用——很簡單的呀！加工競造為第二次大屠殺時侯用的「肉彈丸」，罷了！</p>

<p>馬路上，在繁盛底都市中的夜裏的馬路上，熱鬧　　的聲音，　　每一個角落震響着，這在過着豪奢的生活的城市的人們，這種喧擾的聲響，正像是奏着快樂底歌曲，心靈都給它迷住着。但是他，却像是一個被這個世界裏的人們所拋棄似的，對於這些聲響，一點也沒有享受着，因他的聽覺已是麻木已是一個聾子了。聽這音樂樣的都市之聲響他已經是沒一福份的了。</p>
<p>他自己也感到莫明其妙，自從聾了之後，他不知是怎樣的羨慕着聽着音樂而感到快樂的人。在一年前，還是聽覺很靈活時的他，他是如何的討厭這都市裏的喧擾的聲音底襲擊，有時使他那不安的心，更加的感到暴燥。他時時在希望，能够跳出這都市而去在靜息的地方。可是這種想念，在他是無論如何也不能够實現的空想，他離開都市，他就會受到更甚的痛苦的，生活的因壓，是使他不得不在這裏活下來。但是自從他聾了之後，這種態度是完全變了，起初他是羨慕他人，近來却漸漸地成為仇恨了，在他的心中，浮現着一種敵視的觀念，他以為不聾的人，是太不應該，太過於斯凌他這種失去了聽覺的人了。似乎那些不聾的人，在他認為是不應存在這個世界裏的。</p>
<p>為了他的失去了聽覺，他的心也就靜息而感到寂寞了。然而幻雜的念頭，也就在他的心中蠢動得更厲害起來。這種眼前的不堪的境况，在靜思時，令他更感到痛苦。</p>
<p>他，一個四十歲的人，為了聾而失業，這使他的生活更加的陷落在不堪的地步中，雖然沒有妻子也沒孩子，但那一對七十多歲的父母，是好似一擔極重的擔子壓在他的已經失去負擔重量底能力的肩上。一個聾子單獨的在人世間掙扑已是極困難的事了，然而呌他再擔起這據子來，是會把他壓死的。</p>
<p>他往徒想起了在未聾之前的教書生活，雖然那時也並不怎樣的過着豐裕的生活，但是不致失業以後的這樣落魄的窮困。是的，在有職業的時候，他往往對於生活的不滿，而希求有新的發展，可是那種　　是不會實現的，反而現在跌落到這樣的環境中，兩種生活的比較，不然而然的他就感至過去的生活是美滿的。</p>
<p>「教了那末多年的書，現在却失業而變成一個聾子」。</p>
<p>他時時這樣的自嘆着，而且時時生出一種厭世的念頭，他知道他的希望是完了。可是當他從外回來，看見了那一對七十多歲的父母在飢餓綫上掙扎的苦臉，他又浮起着一個報答養育的功勞的觀念，那種輕生的念頭，又在他的心中漸漸地淡薄而消失去了。但擺在眼前的「要如何生活下去」的問題，又使他的心跳動起來。</p>
<p>「要怎樣的生活下去呢」？這一個煩難的問題，好似是有千斤重量的一塊石頭緊壓在他的心上，他這聾了之後而失業的教書匠，終日的給這個問題苦惱着，一切的掙扎，都使他絕望而感到人生的渺茫了。</p>
<h3 id="c210">無言的戀思 <a href="#c210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>— 西蒙</p>
<p>一雙秘藏着少女早熟的熱情感的珠子，南國的特有風咮哪！廣東土產，一想起了，便給那雙熱情感的珠子迷住了心，烏溜溜地，像夏天的龍眼核，射着刺人的赤色的光芒。</p>
<p>我的戀思者的心裏的愛神啊財露西娜</p>
<p>那天是個煩惱的頂易呌人做夢的春天的下午，春天是挺適宜於戀的季候，正準備睏一覺，屋子外猛的有一支女人的尖嗓子在呌着。</p>
<p>便靜靜聽着：怪熟爛的，莫非是露茜娜！</p>
<p>果然露茜娜扮着武裝笑媚媚地出現在門口了。</p>
<p>我真給跳了上來，露茜娜今天挺俏麗的：健康色的嫩紅的肌肉色素，結實的胳膊，豐滿的胸兜子，褲筒子高高地掛到膝裸上，大腿子的曲綫感美妙地凝集在我的眼底。</p>
<p>有熱情感却另有西洋味的嬌健的露茜娜啊！</p>
<p>—露茜娜，有什麽事？</p>
<p>—春天啦，我們到郊外騎馬，消磨個把煩悶的下午。</p>
<p>一下午我的困倦的精神馬上湧了勁兒了。</p>
<p>春天的田野，躺在春天的溫雅的陽光下，靜美地，天是橙藍的，雲也是橙藍的，低低地在腦袋上邊游離着。田野上，綠色的菜花離着白色的菜花，綠色的白花的菜花香混合泥士的味蕩漾在微風裏。</p>
<p>微風吹拂着露蒼娜的捲髪，流海在波動着。</p>
<p>春天真是戀的季候節啊！」一切全是醉人的。我感到自己是幸福的。愉快的。</p>
<p>在大路上，我們坐在馬背上，迎着溫暖的風，徐徐地向前，露茜娜輕輕地吹着一隻時行曲的口哨，我也跟着吹，到了小路的時光，便讓露茜娜跑在前邊，一點也沒恍惚，像一個英勇的女皇似地，可是我的心却是脆弱的。</p>
<p>我有沒有愛着她的份兒呢，忽然那麽暗問着。</p>
<p>穿過一條高高的蘆葦叢的池塘路，露茜娜用手去挪開攔阻着的蘆葦枝子，給銳利葉片刺傷了大拇指那兒淌了點兒血出來，但她好像不欲呌我知道似的，悄悄地掏出一塊小手巾抹着，但是我可看清楚。</p>
<p>—露茜娜，你的手為什麽流血了。</p>
<p>—沒有的，不過給刺痛了一下。</p>
<p>露茜娜回過頭來，倩媚地微笑，而我的心却不禁難過着。</p>
<p>那紅色的血正是戀的象徵，少女火熱的青春情的象徵啊！</p>
<p>挨近傍晚，我們帶點倦意回來。</p>
<p>一個煩惱的春夭的下午。便那麽在溫柔的情調裏過去了。</p>
<p>合露茜娜在一塊兒玩才是第一遭呢。</p>
<p>露茜娜有對秘藏着少女早熟的熱情感的珠子，戀的象徵啊！笑着的時候，像開薔薇花似的，使人想到她有一個燦爛的年輕的身子，以及燦爛的年輕的青春。</p>
<p>幾乎片刻也忘掉不了她，可是我也</p>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>把我年輕的戀思，年輕的無言的惓念，靜靜地沉澱在心底處，不曾吿訴任何人，連露茜娜。可是我知道她是聰明的，懂事的，知道她也有如自己有着一顆年輕的戀思的心，戀思的惓念，靜靜地沉澱在心底處。像自己。—露茜娜什麽時候讓我們兩顆無言的戀思的心結在一起開花呢，你說吧！</p>
<h3 id="c211">又是一年春花落 <a href="#c211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>— 羅伽</p>
<p>我　　　　　　的，縱然，還未曾荒蕉得沒有一朵花：然而，倦縮在牆角的三色菫，寥落地繞着槿樹短籬的　蘿花，處女似的嬌怯的含羞草，以及有着樸野味的十丈紅，它們全是開着一些寂寞的花，連那葉子底綠色，也是寂寞的，如同我底心境一樣地，它們是太把我底園子形容得寂寞了哪！我相信沒有了那些花，我底園子應當還有一點春意呢！</p>
<p>無須（或者是不欲。）忽惶地到圍子里找尋春底行蹤，我這樣打算，我知道自己的現在的」份寂寞，是當年太興奮太熟鬧的一種適宜的懲罰（說得輕些，那末是調劑吧！）而我也安於這一種懲罰，樂意地。</p>
<p>黃昏底烟藹如同霧轂似地，抱着我底夜的園子，夜的園子是會更寂寞了的嗎？於是我拉着古藤的手杖（我是一個年輕的老人哪！）踏進夜的園子，我悄悄的坐下在草坪上，那屬放植物性的淸幽香味，就毫不吝嗇的供給我輕輕地呼吸，我底神經感覺是銳敏一點了，於是，我想睜開眼睛，準備在黃昏的園子里，搜索一點甚麽？不管搜索所得到的，是不是我底心愛的。然而，我能够得到一點甚麽呢？暮色中的花枝舞動的姿態嗎？漾着春底氣息的晚風嗎？</p>
<p>恬淡的思緒中，不希望得到甚麽？也不希望不得到甚麼？我固執着我底昔日的小語：</p>
<p>「得失是動亂了恬淡的思緒，這是殘酷的行為。」</p>
<p>所以，我閉上眼睛，黃昏的園子底寂寞的輕幔里，我有着一潭靜靜的沉思</p>
<p>（我說：我底沉思是浪費的，浪費於重量的記憶中，夢幻似的浮遊着，像一片黃葉，給傷感的風輕輕一吹，掉落到薄愁的海里，而寂寞的黃昏的園子，却會渲染了一層憂鬱的彩色，這顯然是太愚蠢了！太愚蠢了。）</p>
<p>我會自作聰明的，手便伸進口袋里，白衣外套的紙烟啣上了，火柴的微光一閃，却衝破了園子底沉靜，杏樹上棲宿着的一對梅花雀，許是不常經騐到火光，由是便飛鳴起來。這，對於我，是很引以為不安的，同時，這，也等於守園者底逐客令，這樣，我便悄悄地出去了！</p>
<p>慣常地，每個黃昏，我底脚會踏進園子去，我願意這樣做，厭倦是不能奪去我底嗜好的。</p>
<p>今日的黃昏是有着一抹微晦的月光的，當我照舊踏進園子，照舊閉目靜坐，坐够了，睜開眼，預備離開這座園子的時候，我發現了一些零落的花瓣，是寂寞地躺着。於是，我會毫無理由地生了悽愴之感，我的情感是如此脆弱呵！</p>
<p>是的，園子里的花，却更把園子顯得寂寞一點，可是，我是不慣於物態的織動，我喜歡平凡，常態，我不忍看我底園子里，增加了甚麽？同樣地，我不忍看我底園子里，缺少了甚麽？（因為我愛心底寗靜，心底寗靜會被物態的變動所掠奪的。）</p>
<p>為了這，我和我底園子會驟然生疏了！園門口的那條滿積靑苦的石鋪小徑，不復有我底展痕了！我這樣抒定了主意。</p>
<p>明年花開，我還蟄居在這里嗎？我不敢想。</p>

<p>— 雲門</p>
<p>現由南京公映的「蘭因絮果」，原名「梵妮莎情史」，Vanessai　HerLoveStory係時下英國小說名家許華爾浦爾Hrgb　Walpote專寫英倫肯堡蘭Cumberland地之哈萊斯大族Herries歷代掌故，四大傑著之一。當米高梅决定採用他的作品爲劇本後，華氏本人親赴好萊塢監製襄助，在該片攝竣公世，成名之後，他就翩然回祖國去了。</p>
<p>在一蘭因絮果」中，當然漢倫海絲，洛勃蒙高茂萊兩位主角的表演天才，是母庸介紹的；可是漢倫却深恨那種水銀燈下生活，所以她禁止她自己女兒步着她後塵，她將來唯一奢望，是願爲主動的大導演。同時蒙高茂萊他日下野後計劃，却是良田萬頃，過他農夫的歲月呢。而初現銀幕飾蒙高茂萊之妻的愛尼絲安得生，Agnes　Anderson還是一位獲選的標準美人兒。</p>
<p>吾們知道維多利亞后，Oueen　Vectoria爲合併印度第一任加印度皇后。她在一八八七年六月畢行黃金登極典禮，而「蘭因絮果」也有關於這個盛大莊嚴的典禮的演出：尤其難得者，是背景服裝風尚等等之酷肖畢眞。</p>
<p>這裏值得注意的更有幾點：（一）本片攝製者曾貢獻「塊肉餘生」「自由萬歲」「小婦人」「晚宴」等巨片之大衛西耳尼克，DavidO．Selznick（二）導演爲導演「風流案」聞名的惠廉霍華德，W．K．Howard（三）配演明星有梅洛勃遜，魯意史東，奧託克魯淦等，這些可以保證「蘭因絮果」的確是不同凡響之浪漫作品。</p>

<p>攝影塲裏人的臉上都怪驚奇的。</p>
<p>「是在史東山導演的「人之初」裏與王引結過一次婚」。</p>
<p>「哈哈哈哈」攝影塲裏頓時起了一個閧塲大笑。</p>

<p>(Chongqing) The First Route Army recaptured Zitong at noon on the 1st and occupied Zhaohua on the night of the 30th. They are now advancing towards Jiange. The Zhu-Mao bandit remnants are between Pingchang, Zangqu, and near Ge Baishui. They are now fleeing west of Zhanyi. Yang Shangkun, political commissar of the fake Third Army Corps, has been killed by our forces. (2nd, Central News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The 8th Army's Liu Dingjun Brigade recaptured Zhaohua County on the 30th, inflicting heavy casualties on the bandits. On the same day, Li Brigade captured Niu Ba Ping, a key point in front of Weicheng. Also, Xu bandit headquarters have moved to Gongzishan, outside Youcheng. (1st, Central News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) Deng Xihou telegraphed Chongqing at noon on the 1st: (1) Our Baihe Liu Brigade occupied Zhaohua City on the 30th and is dispatching troops to pursue towards Jiange. (2) Our Li Brigade has dispatched troops to occupy Zitong today. (1st, Central News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>(Changsha) According to a telegram from Wang Jialie, Zhenfeng has been completely recovered by our army. Scattered bandits in Xingren and Luodian have also been successively cleared, with no trace of bandits remaining. In the battles of Guanyin Cave, Sanguanying, Lu Shi Ying Old Camp, and Hongbanqiao, the bandits suffered heavy casualties, corpses lying everywhere. The main force has been almost completely destroyed. It will not be difficult to completely eliminate the remaining bandits in the short term. (1st, Central News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>Guiyang: According to recent political circles, the communist bandits in Guizhou Province have been almost completely suppressed, with only a few remnants in the southwest corner, appearing and disappearing with government troops. The communist bandits are currently lingering near Maling (transliteration). Government troops are gradually encircling them. The weather has been fine in recent days, so the government troops' attacks on the communist bandits have been very effective. After recent losses, the number of bandits remaining is difficult to estimate, as they have been forcibly conscripting strong young men from villages along the way. However, it is said that the bandits are running out of bullets and have only six field radios left. The communist bandit re-education center here has seen its numbers increase daily, now approaching four thousand. Chiang Kai-shek received Reuters reporters today. Chiang is in robust health. Chiang's wife visited Yangming Cave, 53 miles northwest of Guiyang, on Sunday and today visited the wounded soldiers in Dongshan. (1st, Reuters dispatch)</p>

I am not used to living in the south, so I came south in the spring to attend the meetings of the Legislative Yuan. There are no other tasks. The Mongolian Political Council's conference was originally scheduled to close on April 30, but because there were many proposals this time, the discussions took a lot of time. It has now been decided to extend the closing date. I have two proposals regarding Mongolian security. I do not know if they will be passed. I have not heard anything in Peiping about Prince Yun and Prince De coming south. Although Prince Yun's illness has improved, he still feels inconvenienced in his movements.

<h3 id="e22">The Problem of Siamese Oppression of Overseas Chinese <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>— Ji</p>
<p>In recent years, our overseas Chinese compatriots have been subjected to oppression by the governments of various countries. Their suffering is deep and their situation is miserable, beyond what we can bear to say. The lamentations of overseas Chinese, recorded in newspapers, have become common knowledge among the Chinese people. Looking at the recent situation, in November of last year, a shocking tragedy of selling Chinese occurred in Keansburg, New Jersey, USA. At that time, 38 Chinese compatriots were involved, of whom only 18 were rescued. In the same year, in the Dutch-owned province of Cilacap, a tragic case occurred in which a fisherman of a certain country instigated his employees to shoot and kill the Huang Shuiyuan family, overseas Chinese from Fujian. At that time, all overseas Chinese in the city were indignant and submitted a complaint to the consulate in Medan, requesting justice. Subsequently, our consulate in Medan sent a letter to the local authorities requesting an investigation of the truth and punishing the murderers according to law. Japan has also recently cracked down on overseas Chinese. The number of overseas Chinese forced to return home has now reached more than fifty batches. As for Siam, its government, since this year, has disregarded the historical relationship between China and Siam and has been implementing concrete measures to assimilate our overseas Chinese compatriots in Siam. Starting from April 1, all forced classes in Chinese schools will be cancelled. All overseas Chinese children aged seven to fourteen must transfer to Siamese schools to study Siamese. At the same time, it also restricts Chinese business and industry. All Chinese shops must employ one Siamese as an employee. Chinese factories must also arrange for as many Siamese as possible. Other measures, such as high business taxes and income taxes, are secondary. This kind of means, on the one hand, uses education to assimilate our inherent national character, and on the other hand, restricts the freedom of industry and commerce to control the property of our overseas Chinese compatriots. This is more serious than simply restricting the entry of overseas Chinese.</p>
<p>Focusing solely on the situation in Siam, the number of our overseas Chinese compatriots in Siam is estimated at about three million, accounting for one-third of the total population of Siam. More than two-thirds of its domestic Siamese and Lao people are also mixed with Han Chinese blood. Therefore, in terms of blood relationship, the Siamese nation is no different from a branch of the Chinese nation. According to its economic situation, the large and small businesses in Siam are operated by our overseas Chinese compatriots, especially the rice and timber industries. Siam is a purely agricultural country. Every year, rice exports account for two-thirds of its total exports. Recently, the number of Siamese rice imported into China has been enormous. The commercial and economic relations between the two countries cannot be said to be not close. The overseas Chinese in the Siamese rice industry have 80 large rice mills, each producing about 2.2 million tons of rice per year. There are about 800 small rice mills, each producing about 1.2 million tons of rice per year. The total investment amounts to about 20 million baht (Siamese currency). Overseas Chinese in Siam have such a huge economic power and have their inherent peaceful, patient, and hardworking virtues, so they have always lived in harmony with the Siamese people and have a harmonious relationship. However, since the revolution of 1932, the Siamese People's Party has been in power, and narrow-minded nationalistic sentiments have spread throughout the country. As a result, anti-Chinese movements have occurred frequently. In October 1933, there was an incident in which Siamese police brutally killed overseas Chinese without reason. In February 1934, there was a restriction on the entry of overseas Chinese. Recently, it has taken a further step to fundamentally assimilate our overseas Chinese. Our country and Siam have always been countries without treaties. So far, no commercial treaty has been signed, and no envoys have been exchanged. This diplomatic deficiency makes it easy for others to alienate the feelings between the two countries. Therefore, we hope that the authorities will seek remedies as soon as possible. The Sino-Siamese Commercial Treaty should be signed as soon as possible. The exchange of envoys between the two countries should be facilitated to gradually establish normal diplomatic relations between the two countries. At the same time, we hope that the entire country will unanimously restrict the import of Siamese rice to give Siam a considerable economic stimulus, so that the government and the people of that country will know that the Chinese side is not without reaction and will have to automatically improve its treatment of our overseas Chinese compatriots. If both sides can move forward in this way, the suffering of our three million overseas Chinese compatriots in Siam can gradually be alleviated.</p>

It is said that the Prime Minister will reiterate the statement made by Lord President of the Council Baldwin last November that Britain would never allow its air force to be inferior to Germany's. However, since that statement, the German situation has changed. Therefore, Britain's air force strength will now be expanded at an accelerated pace. It is said that it will be necessary to propose an additional expenditure of five million pounds. The cabinet held a meeting yesterday to discuss the government's foreign policy and finalized the remarks to be made during today's House of Commons debate. It is expected that Foreign Secretary Simon will provide the House with all available information regarding Germany's rearmament. Churchill and others will deliver passionate speeches, either demanding immediate action against Germany or demanding a large increase in armaments. What can be predicted is that the government's plan will receive almost unanimous support. The Labour Party has indicated that it does not oppose any efforts to maintain world peace, and it is widely believed that the government will advise the public to deal with the newly armed Germany with caution and patience.

<p>(London) Prime Minister MacDonald, speaking in the House of Commons today to begin the debate on imperial defense, said that if an arms agreement had been reached with Germany earlier, the current danger in Europe could have been largely eliminated. The recent London Declaration clearly indicated that we are about to break away from the scope of Versailles and readjust European relations based on free negotiations on security and military strength. It is very regrettable that the German government abruptly announced its intention to implement compulsory military service and create an air force at a time when its announced reasons could have been seen as a good-faith hope for improving Europe. Britain does not wish to attend the Rome Conference to discuss Austrian independence because British authorities do not want to take on any new responsibilities. However, it will send personnel to attend as observers. Britain must now decide whether to abandon the attempt to build general trust or to seek refuge in unity, which can never avoid war. German leader Hitler told British Foreign Secretary Simon that he was willing to negotiate a multilateral non-aggression pact with the countries of Eastern Europe. This proposal must not be allowed to die. MacDonald further said that there is no reason to say that this pact cannot be harmonized with the Franco-Russian mutual assistance treaty.

<p>(London) This afternoon, a meeting was held in the Prime Minister's office in the House of Commons for an hour and a half to informally discuss the current international situation. Those participating in the meeting were Prime Minister MacDonald, Foreign Secretary Simon, Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain, Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs Thomas, Secretary of State for the Colonies Lister, Canadian Prime Minister Bennett, Australian Prime Minister Lyons, and South African Prime Minister Hertzog. Hertzog was accompanied by South African Minister of Mines Duncan. A public statement was issued afterward stating that today's informal talks discussed the current international situation. Prime Minister MacDonald and Foreign Secretary Simon reported on recent talks and meetings with European countries. Simon described the events of the past two or three months, including the Anglo-French talks in February, Germany's declaration of compulsory military service, Simon and Eden's visit to European capitals, the Stresa Conference, and the League of Nations Executive Council meeting. It is said that MacDonald also participated in the talks, briefly outlining the government's policies on the above matters. The talks were entirely limited to international affairs. The Dominion Prime Ministers asked many questions, all of which were answered one by one. The Prime Ministers will meet again to discuss the international situation, but the date has not been set.

<p>(Berlin) Authorities announced today that the compulsory military service decree will be implemented on October 1, 1935. (Reuters, 2nd)</p>
<p>(Berlin) German newspapers are currently paying close attention to international reactions, especially to Britain's reaction to Germany's rearmament. German newspapers are now watching today's House of Commons debate on national defense with great interest. It is said that Hitler and key figures in the German military have differing opinions on the policy of rearmament. It is said that Defense Minister Blomberg does not approve of the German leader's sudden decision to reimpose compulsory military service because the military has not yet fully planned for compulsory military service. Therefore, Hitler's move has disrupted the plans of the national defense forces. Furthermore, whether Germany should adopt a policy of negotiation and cooperation with the great powers is also a point of contention within political circles. (Reuters, 2nd)</p>

<p>(Berlin) German Aviation Minister General Goering told foreign journalists today that the way Germany has built its air force means that the German air force is now prepared to maintain its position to compete with any air force in the world. He also said that German aircraft are not hidden anywhere. Not long ago, Germany had no air force, but today, Germany's air force is very strong and can withstand attacks from any direction. All German fighter planes are the latest models. (Reuters, 2nd)</p>

<p>(London) According to news received here today, in the demilitarized zone of the Rhineland in Germany, at least two cities have already had their police replaced by military forces. However, in the British House of Lords, some people are still defending Germany's violation of the Treaty of Versailles. According to the reliable London Express, Germany has dispatched troops to the demilitarized zone, but it is said that the number is small and cannot be regarded as a hostile act violating the treaty. The government has not yet received any official news, but since the newspaper has this news, the Foreign Office has indicated that it will conduct an investigation. As for the House of Lords debate on Germany's rearmament plan, the person defending Germany was Viscount Astor. Astor said that the sins of Britain and France are insignificant compared to those of Germany. Viscount Cecil said, "I used to think that Germany also had its reasons, but judging from the current situation, it is doing everything in its power to go against the whole world." Naval Minister Monsell also delivered a speech in the House of Commons on Germany's naval construction plan. Monsell said that Germany is vigorously rearming, and its first batch of submarines should be completed within half a year because Germany notified the British government on April 26 that these submarines were ordered last winter. Britain's official protest against Germany's naval plans will probably be delivered to German leader Hitler by Foreign Secretary Simon today. Simon and Monsell consulted with French Naval Minister Pietri for a long time yesterday. The results have not been announced, but observers believe that Britain and France will deal with Germany's violation of the treaty in a unified manner. (National News Agency, 2nd)</p>

Although the details are not yet known, it is said that the addition of two squadrons of aircraft to Singapore is being considered, bringing the total number of squadrons there to five. Whether or not to organize an auxiliary aircraft team is also under consideration. (Reuters, 1st)</p>
<p>(Paris) Foreign Minister Laval received British Ambassador Sir Clerk Kerr yesterday. According to political sources here, the reason for the meeting was to confirm the French government's views on Germany's announced intention to build submarines. Political sources also said that the British Ambassador in Rome also conveyed the views of the Italian government. (National News Agency, 1st)</p>
<p>(London) Naval Minister Sir Bolton Eyres Monsell recently stated in the House of Commons on the issue of Germany's naval rearmament that on April 26, the German government notified the British Embassy in Germany's naval attache that it had ordered twelve 250-ton submarines and all the naval weaponry for those submarines on December of last year. The first submarine will be completed within six months. Opposition Labour Party member Greenwood said that the construction of submarines requires nickel, and 90% of the world's nickel production is controlled by Britain. Moreover, Germany does not produce copper or tin. Therefore, British exporters cannot avoid responsibility for Germany's submarine construction. The Naval Minister did not respond to Greenwood's statement. (Havas, 1st)</p>
<p>(London) The British Cabinet held a meeting this morning to discuss the steps Britain should take after Germany rearmed its navy and air force. It is said that Air Minister Lord Londonderry proposed a plan to strengthen Britain's air defenses at the Cabinet meeting. (Havas, 1st)</p>
<h3 id="e34">Franco-Russian Mutual Assistance Pact Could Be Initialed Any Day <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>(Paris) Foreign Minister Laval is scheduled to meet with Soviet Ambassador to France Potemkin at 7:00 PM today, at which time the Franco-Russian mutual assistance pact may be initialed. The content of the pact, as revealed by Le Petit Parisien, consists of five articles in addition to the protocol. Here is a copy of the articles as published in Le Petit Parisien:</p>
<p>Article 1: When a contracting country is subjected to aggression or the threat of aggression, it shall immediately consult to seek the implementation of the provisions of Article 10 of the League of Nations Covenant (Note: Article 10 of the Covenant states that in the event of aggression or the threat of aggression, the League of Nations Executive Council shall devise methods to fulfill the obligation to guarantee the territorial integrity and political independence of member states).</p>
<p>Article 2: If the Executive Council cannot make a unanimous decision in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 7 of Article 15 of the League of Nations Covenant, then France and Russia shall immediately implement mutual assistance (Note: Paragraph 7 of Article 15 of the Covenant states that if the representatives attending the Executive Council, with the exception of the two parties in the dispute, cannot unanimously pass a report resolving the dispute, then the member states of the League of Nations reserve the right to take actions deemed necessary to maintain fairness and justice).</p>
<p>Article 3: If a contracting country is subjected to aggression without provocation, it shall implement mutual assistance in accordance with the provisions of Article 16 and paragraph 3 of Article 17 of the League of Nations Covenant (Note: Article 16 stipulates financial, economic, and military sanctions against aggressor states, and paragraph 3 of Article 17 stipulates that the provisions of Article 16 may also be applied to non-member states).</p>
<p>Article 4: Stipulates the guarantee of all obligations of the League of Nations Covenant.</p>
<p>Article 5: The obligation of mutual assistance is limited to Europe. (Havas, 2nd)</p>
<p>(Paris) At 9:30 tonight, Soviet Ambassador Potemkin went to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to meet with Foreign Minister Laval. It was originally scheduled to initial the Franco-Russian Mutual Assistance Pact and send a copy of the articles to the governments of friendly nations, and then publish it within 24 hours. Unexpectedly, at 10:50, Potemkin left the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and told reporters that he still needed to seek his government's opinion, so the pact would not be initialed until tomorrow. (Havas, 1st)</p>
<p>(Paris) When Foreign Minister Laval met with Soviet Ambassador Potemkin tonight, the two countries compared their proposed articles for the mutual assistance pact. There were still differences of opinion. Therefore, Potemkin will consult with his government. Once he receives instructions, he will meet with Laval again. People in French and Russian circles here believe that the pact can be initialed tomorrow, and the date of Laval's trip to Russia will also be determined tomorrow. (Havas News Agency, 1st)</p>
<p>(Paris) The details of the proposed Franco-Russian military alliance were initially agreed upon earlier this week. However, there was an abrupt setback at the last minute, and the first signature could not be affixed immediately. The agreement was scheduled to be signed last night, but Soviet Ambassador Potemkin suddenly claimed that it was still necessary to consult the government. Political circles here are not pessimistic about this delay and believe that the agreement can be signed today. (Reuters, 1st)</p>
<p>(Paris) The Cabinet meeting yesterday afternoon rejected the automatic mutual assistance clause in the Franco-Russian military agreement. Foreign Minister Laval immediately continued his talks with Russian Ambassador Potemkin. The Russian ambassador also sought instructions from Moscow via long-distance telephone regarding the French Cabinet's amendments. The French Foreign Minister and the Russian Ambassador are scheduled to meet again today, at which time Moscow's reply should arrive here. (National News Agency, 1st)</p>
<p>(Paris) According to the Daily, although the signing of the Franco-Russian pact has many difficulties, and the French Cabinet is unwilling to extend large loans as requested by the Soviet Union, most industrial engineers have gone to Moscow to discuss plans with Soviet experts to build many new railways to the west. The newspaper also claimed that the Soviet government has indicated that if the French government cannot accept the automatic mutual assistance clause, it will terminate the negotiations. (National News Agency, 1st)</p>
<p>(Paris) The detailed situation of the proposed Franco-Russian military alliance was presented to the House of Representatives for the first time today. Foreign Minister Laval announced that the treaty would be initialed today and formally signed when he visits Moscow in a few weeks. It is said that the military clauses of the agreement will have a very important relationship with the League of Nations when implemented because the agreement stipulates that if France and Russia have a conflict with another country or are attacked by another country, they must first notify the League of Nations. If the League of Nations cannot unanimously pass a solution, then France and Russia will deal with the matter themselves, that is, unite the military forces of the two countries to seek a response. It is said that other countries may join the agreement, and Czechoslovakia has already expressed its willingness to join. At the same time, news from Moscow stated that Soviet Deputy Commissar of War Tukhachevsky made an alarming statement, saying that Germany is currently able to invade France with a force greater than France's entire military in a few hours, while still having the strength to be used for other purposes.

Since Congress may soon adjourn, the German government should agree to it as soon as possible. The existing treaty between the two countries will expire on October 4 this year, and Germany declared its termination last October. This new treaty does not include the most-favored-nation treatment clause. (Reuters, 1st)</p>

<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt today took extraordinary action and ordered the House Armed Services Committee to cease any more public disclosure of Army Department plans. If necessary, he would exercise his authority as Commander-in-Chief of the Army and Navy to prevent the publication of statements which might be regarded as unfriendly to other nations. President Roosevelt's warning was issued in response to two major proposals being made by the committee: one, Air Corps Leader General Andrews's proposal to seize British and French islands near the American coast in an emergency; and two, Deputy Chief of Staff Brigadier General Gilbreath's suggestion to establish a large air force base on the Canadian border under a false name. The above three items were part of the opinions expressed by Army officials during a secret meeting of the House Armed Services Committee. Unexpectedly, the committee printed copies and distributed them to the outside world. President Roosevelt stated in his warning that the opinions of Gilbreath and Andrews do not completely represent the policies of the Commander-in-Chief or the Bureau. If confidential statements are also printed and distributed to the outside world and treated as statements made during public meetings, then he will, as Commander-in-Chief, order that all statements proposed by government personnel to the committee in the future must be reviewed by the President before they can be presented.

<p>(Washington) The authorities of the National Recovery Act advocated an extension of two years, but the Senate Finance Committee disagreed. Today, it voted to extend the Act until April 1936 and decided to prohibit fixed prices. It also decided to limit the application of industrial codes to interstate businesses. President Roosevelt was unwilling to make any criticism to reporters today, but NRA leader Hugh Johnson strongly opposed the temporary extension of the NRA. (Reuters, 1st)</p>
<p>(Washington) At the 23rd annual meeting of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce held here today, President Harriman delivered a speech requesting the authorities to postpone their reform plans for the sake of the country's rapid recovery. His words were euphemistic, but his intention was very firm. He had many disagreements with the major guidelines advocated by the House of Representatives, saying that the new measures wanted to implement many good policies but wanted to achieve too much in too short a period of time. His criticism was both complimentary and critical. Harriman listed four points of the recovery guidelines, saying that if the government could follow them, unemployment could be avoided and employment could be increased: (1) The government should announce that Congress will soon adjourn, and all major reform plans should be postponed until industry truly recovers; (2) Strive for international monetary stability as soon as possible so that foreign trade can flow and reduce risks; (3) Make a clear statement that the continued devaluation of the U.S. dollar will not be used as a way to restore prices; (4) Declare that government spending will be effectively and actively reduced after the current urgent funds have been exhausted. Harriman also said that the National Recovery Administration, the Agricultural Adjustment Administration, and other agencies all have a tendency to help the government interfere in commerce. The national debt is increasing daily, labor laws lack soundness, public works are more destructive than constructive, and the plans for heavily taxing the wealthy are also like madness. All of these are what commerce is afraid of. He approved of the continuation of the NRA, but the President's power to issue industrial codes should be removed. The agricultural program is not entirely unreasonable, but the amendments to the Agricultural Adjustment Act should not be so hasty, and the scope of the Public Utility Holding Company Act should be limited. Appropriate holding companies should still be allowed to exist. Harriman concluded by saying that when he discussed the new policy plans with businessmen, he felt that what people opposed most was not the basic principles of these plans, but their overly hasty implementation. The new measures have forgotten that gradual evolution must follow the evolution of human experience. (Reuters, 30th)</p>

<p>(Moscow) Yesterday's May Day commemoration was the largest demonstration in the 18 years since the founding of Soviet Russia, and it was full of ridicule for capitalist countries, especially Japan and Germany. The Red Army held a parade in Red Square, and 650 large bombers circled in the air. More than one million civilians participated in the parade. The flags and slogans held by the parading masses were all words ridiculing the people of other countries. Soviet Minister of War Voroshilov said in a speech after inspecting the troops, "If anyone forces us to fight, then these people will experience the strength of our army." U.S. Ambassador Bullitt also participated in the parade. A 72-foot-tall giant statue of Stalin was hung on the front of the building in front of the square. During the parade, the people cheered for Stalin. This inspection was sufficient to show the rapid progress of the Soviet army in recent months. (National News Agency, 2nd)</p>
<p>(Berlin) "We are telling the people of all countries in the world that the Germans want nothing from the world. We do not want war, we only want world peace. But the Germans will never give up their honor." This is the National Socialist Party's policy platform proclaimed by German leader Hitler in two speeches to the general public in Berlin yesterday on National Day. Hitler's speech to 600,000 people at Tempelhof Airport was extremely short, lasting only 26 minutes. (National News Agency, 2nd)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Today is Germany's National Labor Day. The weather is cold and snowing. Hundreds of thousands of employers and workers gathered in the snow at the Lustgarten to celebrate. German leader Hitler, suffering from a sore throat, gave only a brief speech, saying that Germany's ambition is for peace. The international political situation is full of thorns, and only by enduring hardship can the struggling German people overcome major difficulties. May 1st is the day our nation makes a decision. We must be determined, united, and inseparable. (Havas, 1st)</p>

Our air security is guaranteed by aircraft squadrons. At this time, those who are in charge of national affairs are no longer weaklings, but brave men. Germany can now rest easy.

<p>(London) Although today is Labor Day in the world's major capitals, most are peaceful and uneventful. However, a bomb exploded in the Austrian capital, seriously injuring four or five people. The authorities are strictly arresting communists and have detained 500 people. Last night, a bomb exploded outside a police station in the suburbs of Vienna, injuring four passersby with shrapnel. They have been sent to the hospital. As a result, the authorities took the major action of arresting communists today. Most capitals have made advance preparations to prevent disturbances. Apart from minor clashes, this Labor Day has passed peacefully. More than one million people gathered at an airfield in Berlin, where Hitler gave a speech, saying, "We do not want war. We want world peace, just as we want to restore domestic peace." In Paris, both the Communist Party and the Socialist Party held meetings in Villette. The authorities did not allow them to hold open-air gatherings. The military police were prepared to defend, and the authorities also used airplanes to patrol various places to see if there were any illegal gatherings. A very large demonstration was held in Moscow, with 650 of the latest aircraft circling in the sky. Enlarged photos of Stalin were hung on the highest buildings in the city, some as long as 72 feet. All over Germany, Labor Day was celebrated, but the weather was uncertain, with sunshine at times and heavy snow at others. Propaganda Minister Goebbels spoke first at the meeting, saying, "We all know that the purpose of the army is to protect our work. This kind of protection is better than the Treaty of Versailles." Hitler only spoke for a few minutes due to a sore throat. In Marseille, all boats and vehicles were stopped today. Ships that were originally scheduled to sail today have been postponed until tomorrow because dockers and sailors have stopped working. Municipal workers have also stopped working.

<p>(Paris) The world is gradually moving away from the threat of May Day. Statistics show that more than ten people died and dozens were injured in various countries, and hundreds were arrested. In Iminovo village, Bulgaria, three policemen and five communists died. According to current news, the area is indeed the most eventful center of May Day. According to unofficial reports, the Communist Party intended to hold a meeting in the village after interfering with dance parties of nearby farmers and merchants, resulting in a conflict. After midnight, a riot broke out in the Bagneux area near Paris, killing one gendarme and seriously injuring 28 civilians. Police and rioters chased each other for an hour. The police initially planned to suppress the crowd peacefully, but after one policeman was killed by communists, they opened fire. The two sides clashed for an hour, and the communists were dispersed. More than 50 handguns and bayonets were seized. New York always experiences riots on May Day. Although there was a large-scale demonstration this time, no incidents occurred. 1,600 policemen in the city were dispatched by order of the mayor to prevent disturbances. A bomb exploded in Breitenlee, Vienna, injuring four people. The entire city was ordered to prevent disturbances, and police rushed to the scene. More than 400 people were arrested, including 150 who resisted the police when they were detained. There was also a group of National Socialists who drove through the working-class district, distributing leaflets, attacking Chancellor Schuschnigg and denouncing his government as dishonorable. A telegram from the capital of Romania stated that 18 communists were arrested for plotting to set up obstacles in the streets and seize public buildings. Although Paris is a nest of communists, no serious incidents occurred, only the assassination of one policeman. A May Day demonstration was held in Tokyo, but there were no signs of instability. The participants were mostly left-wing and right-wing workers in the labor movement. (National Telegram, 2nd)</p>

Foreign diplomats, military attachés, and foreign workers' delegations were also present. After the parade, workers, officials, scientists, and artists from Moscow held a large-scale procession, carrying banners and slogans as they marched through Red Square, showcasing the achievements of various factories, regions, and islands, as well as the successes in various aspects of Soviet life and construction. The streets of Moscow were filled with workers celebrating May Day, and revolutionary songs echoed through the sky, with unparalleled enthusiasm.

<h3 id="e41">U.S. Silver Policy to Have a Surprising Move: Predictions from the U.S. Banking Sector <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>(New York) Wall Street researchers of silver trends now predict that the Treasury Department will make a surprising move when taking the next steps in its silver policy. Since the Treasury Department raised the price of silver, the monetary structure of Mexico has been shaken, and world speculation has followed. In view of this situation, the Treasury Department seems unwilling to act hastily. However, many say that the Treasury Department may be forced by pressure to reduce the value of silver dollars according to the gold standard ratio. This statement does not seem unfounded, because the world's supply of silver is not large, and the United States wants to implement Congress's silver policy, which it cannot do. If the price of silver is fixed at $2.18 per ounce, the problem would be easier to solve. If so, the Treasury Department's existing silver reserves, calculated at $1.29 per ounce, are worth about $145 million. If calculated at a price of $2.18 per ounce, it would be $245 million. In this case, the Treasury Department only needs to buy silver worth $41.5 million to establish a gold-silver ratio of three to one. Since the United States still needs to buy silver worth $41.5 million, it can use this to maintain the world price of silver and fulfill Congress's claims without allowing international speculators to manipulate and profit from it. The Treasury Department has not yet commented on its future plans, but Wall Street does not believe that it plans to gradually increase the price of silver and fill its treasury. This kind of procedure can never achieve the goal of a three-to-one gold-silver ratio, only prolongs the uncertain situation, and makes foreign speculators enjoy its benefits. For this reason, Wall Street predicts that the Treasury Department will change its policy. (Reuters dispatch, 1st)</p>

When the robbers fled to Xixiang Village, the villagers captured them. Two handguns were found, and one was thrown into the river. The stolen money could not be found. The three robbers are currently detained at the Third Branch of the County Public Security Bureau. Their names are: Xu Jinlin, 31 years old, from Jiangyin; You Guojun, from Wuxi, 27 years old; and Wang Xisheng, 35 years old, from Changzhou.

<h3 id="e108">The Remnants of Zhu and Mao's Bandits Fled to the Yunnan Border and Were Surrounded; The Northern Sichuan Campaign Proceeds Smoothly; General Hu's Forces Capture Pingwu; Zhang Xueliang Reports to Chiang Kai-shek on His Trip to Henan <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Zhu and Mao's bandit remnants were fiercely attacked in Guizhou, suffering heavy losses. They then fled south along Baiyan, attempting to invade the Zhubian area. However, the National Army relentlessly pursued and attacked, giving them no respite. They changed their plans again, fleeing west through Qipan Mountain to Guangshun, Ziyun, Zhenfeng, and Xingren counties, which were subsequently recovered by the National Army. The bandits had no foothold in Guizhou Province. One group fled from Xingyi and another from Panxian to the Qujing, Zhan'yi, and Xundian areas of Yunnan Province. The losses along the way were countless. Since the bandits left Guizhou Province, the remaining bandits were quickly suppressed, and local reconstruction was carried out. Li Yunjie's troops arrived in Guiyang, awaiting orders to pursue the bandits. Wang Jialie's and Wu Qiwai's troops advanced west across Ziyun and Xingren, encircling the bandits on three sides. The fighting has been fierce in recent days, with many bandits killed. The bandits' fleeing to Yunnan is both to escape the National Army's pursuit and to attempt to cross the Jinsha River and sneak into western Sichuan, gradually plotting to join forces with Xu Xiangqian's bandits. This plan had previously been attempted and failed, and now they are repeating the same mistake, which shows that they are at the end of their rope. On the northern Sichuan front, fierce battles have also been taking place in recent days. Xu Xiangqian's bandits fiercely attacked Zitong, Zhongba, Jiangyou, and Weicheng in dozens of large and small battles, but were all repelled by Deng Xihou's troops. They then concentrated their forces to attack Jiangyou alone, and built fortifications near Guandu and Jiangcheng, indicating a long siege. Yang Shaixuan's brigade of Deng's troops is also making every effort to resist. The people are supplying the troops with food and supplies, and are united in defense. The bandits cannot succeed. Yang Shuxian's brigade is stationed in Qinggangpu, and Gong's brigade is stationed in Maodong, forming a strategic position with Jiangyou. Chen Dingxun's reinforcements arrived in Mianyang via Yanting and immediately joined the front line. As a result, the morale of the Jiangyou defenders is greatly boosted. Although the bandits are brave and fierce, they cannot cross the Fujiang River. North of Jiangyou, Hu Zongnan's division captured the Motianling position on the 28th of last month and advanced to the Tangjiahe-Qingchuan line, capturing Pingwu County in one day. One part of this division, together with the troops of Commander Diao of Deng's army, captured Wulong Mountain. The National Army also occupies an absolute advantage in the upper reaches of the Fujiang River, and Cangxi on the east bank of the Jialing River has also been recovered by the National Army. The bandits are indeed surrounded on all sides, and it is expected that they can be wiped out between Jiangyou and Zitong in a few days and will no longer be a major threat.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Zhang Xueliang, the Director of the Provisional Headquarters sent by Chiang Kai-shek to inspect the Henan and Shaanxi armies, returned to Hubei from Guiyang on the 17th of last month, flew to Kaifeng on the 23rd, went from Kaifeng to Xi'an on the 24th, and returned to Hankou on the 27th. In addition to the inspection, he also met with Liu Zhi and Yang Hucheng to discuss the suppression of the remaining bandits in the border areas and the bandit suppression issues in Sichuan and Shaanxi. In Hubei, he also handled important official matters of the provisional headquarters. Only on the 1st of this month did he take a Ford aircraft to Guiyang to report to Chiang Kai-shek on the progress of his trip. After staying for a few days, he returned to Hubei to take charge.

<p>Jinan Correspondence: He Yingqin, the Minister of Military Administration and Acting Chairman of the Peiping Military Council, arrived in Jinan by special train from Peiping on the afternoon of the 28th to inspect the situation in Shandong Province. Having received prior notice, Han Fuqu specially sent Liu Shuxiang, the Chief of Staff of the Third Route Army Headquarters, to Dezhou on the evening of the 28th to greet him on the special train. On the morning of the 29th, the whole city was decorated with flags. At around 7:00 am, Han Fuqu led representatives from all sectors of the Party, government, and military to welcome him at the station. Security was tight inside and outside the station. Red welcome passes were temporarily issued by the provincial government, and those without passes were not allowed to enter the station. Temporary additions to the welcoming party included Men Zhizhong, a member of the Military Council; Ge Guangting, Chairman of the Jiaoji Railway; Tang Xiang, Director of the Shandong-Henan Joint Tax Bureau; and representatives from Qingdao Mayor Shen Honglie and the Third Fleet Commander Xie Gangzhe. The welcoming lines on the platform were extremely orderly, with the army in the East Station, followed by the provincial government agencies, then the Party headquarters, and the West Station being for the public organizations. At 8:30 am, He's special train entered the station. The troops presented arms, and other personnel removed their hats to salute. He, wearing a military uniform, got off the train, shook hands with the welcomers, and went to the Jinpu Railway Hotel temporary headquarters to rest. At noon, Han hosted a banquet at Lixia Xu on Daming Lake. After the banquet, He went to visit the Provincial Library, Tie Gong Ancestral Hall, Beiji Pavilion and other scenic spots, and visited the Dongguan Civilian Factory, Military Factory, Renfeng Yarn Factory, and Chengtong Yarn Factory, among other places. The important figures of the provincial government hosted a banquet for He in the East Building of the provincial government in the evening, and performed plays to add to the enjoyment. On the morning of the 30th, He inspected the garrison troops and gave a speech in Xinzhuang. The Provincial Party Headquarters, the Municipal Government, and various public organizations originally planned to host a banquet at Thousand Buddha Mountain on the afternoon of the 30th, but later temporarily changed it to Jinde Society. In the afternoon, He also inspected the ordnance factory. It was decided that he would take a special train to Qingdao at 9:00 pm on the 30th. After arriving in Jinan, He made the following statement: "I have been in Beiping for more than two years and have long wanted to come to Shandong to see the construction situation in Shandong Province, but due to busy affairs, I have not been able to fulfill my wish. Recently, the affairs have been slightly simplified, so I took the time to come to Shandong for inspection, and also to see the troops stationed in Jinan. If time permits, I will also go to Qingdao to inspect the municipal situation. Chairman Han's achievements in governing Shandong are well known far and wide. Mayor Shen has also done a lot of construction for Qingdao. I believe that I will definitely get a very good impression during this trip to Shandong. Chairman Chiang has successively promoted the New Life Movement and the National Economic Construction Movement, both of which are necessary plans for a modern country. Chairman Han has vigorously promoted these two movements. I hope that the officials and people of Shandong Province will work hard to implement these two movements under the leadership of Chairman Han." (30th)</p>
<h3 id="e110">Severe Drought in Shandong Province; Wheat Half Wilts Away — Fortunately, Wheat Prices Are Stable and People's Hearts Are at Peace — <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: This spring, the province is suffering from a severe drought. Water is like gold, and the wheat in the fields is rarely able to avoid wilting. It is already past the season when river water or well water can be used for irrigation. Counties where well digging is not widespread can only watch their crops wither and die. Farmers are worried and sighing. The wheat is now less than a foot tall, and the ears of wheat are particularly small and insignificant. Even if it rains now, the harvest will be no more than 50%. The disaster is already apparent throughout the province. According to past practice, wheat prices should soar, and people's food supply should be in panic. However, this year is an exception. The reasons are: (1) Tight financial conditions mean that grain stores do not buy and store much. (2) Flour sales are sluggish in the market, with each bag only costing two yuan and seventy-odd cents, so flour mills are also unwilling to buy more. (3) Those who store wheat are in urgent need of money and are rushing to sell it. Due to these reasons, wheat prices are still stable. Statistics show that there are 9,280 tons of wheat stored in Jinan. In another forty days, the new wheat will be on the market, which will be sufficient to supply the market, so there is no need to worry about shortages. People's hearts are still at peace. (1st)</p>

<p>Datieqiao Township, outside the South Gate of this city, is four or five li from the city. The previous night (30th) at midday, the family of Yu Asan, a villager in the Seventeenth Tu Township of Xijing, was robbed. He had agreed to sell his land for 320 yuan and was drawing up a contract at home. The broker, Feng Xinglou, was also present. Suddenly, more than a dozen robbers, carrying handguns, iron rulers, wooden sticks, and other weapons, broke in. They forbade anyone from making a sound and forced them to change the contract price. However, according to Songjiang customs, the full price is not paid when drawing up a contract. The robbers' demands were not met, and Feng Xinglou was shot and wounded when he tried to raise the alarm. He was sent to Rongcheng Hospital, where Zhang Shaoxiu used surgical techniques to treat him, and his life is not in danger. Yu Asan's wife, Yu Zhangshi, was burned by the robbers, and his uncle, Yu Youtang, was also beaten and injured. As a result, they were all sent to Rongcheng Hospital for treatment. On the same night, the family of Fa Gu Xiangbao in the same area was also robbed. When Gu saw the robbers coming, he threw a stool at them. The robbers fired a gun, and the bullet hit his scrotum, causing him to die. At around 12:00 am on the same night, seven or eight robbers, armed with wooden shoulder poles and wooden sticks, their heads covered with towels, broke into the home of Gu Xiansheng in the Fourteenth Tu outside the South Gate. They ransacked the house. Gu Xiansheng shouted for the police, and the robbers used weapons to injure his left hand, fracturing the bones and causing him great pain. The township head, Gao Zhongkui, has reported the incident to the district office, stating that robberies are frequent so close to the city, causing the people to lose sleep. He requested that the matter be forwarded to the county government for investigation. It is also reported that the injured Gu Xiangbao has died from his injuries.</p>
<h3 id="e112">Jiading: Bank Theft Occurs Again <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>After a major theft occurred at the Jiading Commercial Savings Bank on South Main Street in the city on March 9th, a reward of 1,000 yuan was offered for information leading to the arrest of the thieves, but the case has not yet been solved. Yesterday (1st) night, another theft occurred at the Jiading Farmers Bank on East Main Street. The bank building is rented from the Education Bureau and a sturdy wall was specially built when the bank was established. That night, a small thief climbed over the wall from the Yi Nong lane behind the bank into the compound of the Baptist Church, then dug through two walls on the east side of the bank belonging to the Dai family. From the Dai family's courtyard, he dug west through the wall next to the bank's east side and entered. In the manager's office, he pried open the iron safe and then pried open three small drawers inside. He used special tools, so the key parts of the lock were destroyed, while the other non-essential parts remained intact. This shows that it was done by a very professional thief. However, the bank's savings were stored in a separate, sturdy vault. The safe that the thief opened only contained important documents, which had been returned to the vault the evening before. However, the Nanshu Tian Fu Collection Office had sent over 76 yuan in collected land tax to be deposited in the county treasury, which was stored in that safe and was stolen. After the theft, the thief exited through the same hole in the wall. This morning at 5:00 am, a bank employee discovered the theft and immediately reported it to the County Public Security Bureau for investigation.</p>

<p>This year, the county is short of spring silkworm eggs. The Canrong Model District has ordered Japanese silkworm eggs to meet the market demand. Now, 10,000 sheets of Japanese silkworm eggs have been shipped to Wuxi. It is scheduled to begin selling them today (3rd). Each villager is limited to buying one sheet. However, the weather has been erratic recently. A few days ago, it was extremely hot, and the early spring silkworms in the villages had already hatched. In recent days, the early spring silkworms have even begun to enter the first sleep stage, and the sudden cold weather has affected their development. Fortunately, the weather is clear and sunny, so there is no major problem. As for the late spring silkworms, they have not yet hatched. It is said that some unscrupulous merchants in the Dongting Town area of the Second District are taking advantage of the shortage of spring silkworm eggs and the villagers' urgent need to manufacture inferior silkworm eggs privately, which have not been inspected by the Model District, and are selling them at high prices to make a profit.</p>

<p>In the Fanghua Temple area of the Eighth Bao, Ninety-eighth Tu in Zhou Tanqiao, Third District of the county, a village woman named Zhu Huangshi had an argument with her neighbor Xu Zixuan over a grave site during the Qingming Festival this year. At the time, Zhu Huangshi was extremely angry. However, on the 26th of last month, Huangshi suddenly disappeared. The next morning, her son, Zhu Hongsheng, searched everywhere, but could not find her. However, at noon the day before yesterday, the body of Zhu Huangshi was suddenly found in a deep pool in the river in front of Xu's house. Her head was resting on the beach, which was a strange sight. The villagers all believe that Xu Zixuan is a major suspect. Yesterday, the bao head, Wang Ruichu, and the deceased's son, Zhu Hongsheng, came to the city to report to the local branch court, requesting that someone be sent to conduct an autopsy. The prosecutor, Shen, led his officials to the countryside to conduct an autopsy and further verify the facts.</p>

<p>After the county suffered from a drought, Magistrate Hou sent Jiang Wenzu, a cooperative advisor, to Zhenjiang to negotiate with the Provincial Farmers Bank to expedite the approval of water conservancy loans because the farmers of the county believe that water conservancy cooperatives are very necessary, so many have started to organize them to avoid having to dig wells only when thirst strikes. There are now more than ten such organizations in place. The Provincial Farmers Bank was asked to instruct the County Farmers Bank to expedite the loans. Advisor Jiang set off for Zhenjiang on the 1st.</p>

<h3 id="e118">Literacy Campaign Promotion Week - Opening Ceremony Held This Morning <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>Education Bureau Director Pan Reports, Chairman Wu Issues Instructions. Yesterday Was Radio Broadcast Promotion Day, Today Is Business Community Promotion.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipality held the opening ceremony for the Literacy Education Promotion Week, as well as the inauguration ceremony for the directors of the various district offices and the heads of the service group branches. This morning at nine o'clock, the event was held at the auditorium of the Municipal Central District Zhengzhong Elementary School. Chairman Wu Tiecheng, Education Bureau Director Pan Gongzhan, the directors of various districts, the heads of various group branches, and all staff of the Literacy Education Association attended. Details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Attendees Those present included Chairman Wu Tiecheng, Deputy Chairman Pan Gongzhan, Committee Members Wu Kaixian, Zeng Shengdian, Chen Gongsu, Jiang Jianbai, Ma Chonggan, Xie Engao, Feng Kui, Li Suixian, Tong Xingbai, General Secretary Tao Baichuan, Directors of District Offices Lu Hairun, Tao Guangchuan, Jiang Wenbao, Chen Banchun, Heads of Service Group Branches Yan Zhenyu, Sheng Zhensheng, Cheng Kuanzheng, Gu Yinqian, Xu Shushen, Guests Zhang Chengzhi of the Songhu Garrison Headquarters, Liu Zhaoxing of the Wusong Municipal Office, Chen Ce of the Security Committee, Zhou Zhicheng of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, Hu Changzhi of the Health Bureau, Shui Xiangyun of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, Zhao Shusheng of the Chinese Labor Association, Wu Chuijiu of the Jiangwan Municipal Committee Office, Chen Jixi of the Land Bureau, Feng Chengqiu of the Public Utilities Bureau, and over four hundred others.</p>
<p>Chairman's Address After the ceremonial proceedings, Chairman Pan Gongzhan delivered the opening remarks, stating, "Today is the first day of the Literacy Promotion Week designated by the Municipal Literacy Committee. The directors of the district offices and the heads of the service group branches will also be jointly sworn in today. Everyone understands the importance and significance of literacy education. It is hoped that the directors and group leaders will be responsible for activities within their respective districts under the command of the General Office, and recognize this work as the most important. From today onward, we must proceed diligently according to the prescribed methods. All municipal and registered private schools should lead their students to help those who are illiterate become literate, and vigorously implement literacy education to achieve completion as scheduled."</p>
<p>Wu's Instructions After the Chairman's report, the swearing-in ceremony was held. Chairman Wu delivered instructions, saying, "Fellow gentlemen and comrades, today is May 1st, Labor Day. The Shanghai Municipal Literacy Education Committee has specifically designated today as the first day of Literacy Education Promotion Week, which is of great significance. Ninety percent of the people in our country are poor laborers. If we want to build the country, we must have the concerted efforts of all the people to succeed. But if we want the concerted efforts of all the people to build our country, we must first educate all the people to recognize characters, have knowledge, know that they have a country and a nation, and be able to work hard for the country and the nation. Among the 450 million people in our country, those engaged in direct production, such as workers and farmers, account for the vast majority. This vast majority of direct producers is the main force in maintaining the survival of our entire nation. But this vast majority of people are illiterate and lack knowledge. How can we enable them to increase production and improve production? Of course, it is impossible. Therefore, it has formed the alarming phenomenon in our country today. Premier Sun, in his Principles of Livelihood, told us that China's import surplus today has reached as much as 400 or 500 million yuan, and in less than ten years, it will reach 1 billion yuan. Now, in less than ten years, the import surplus has reached 700 million yuan. Our current way of life is different from the past, but our production methods are still the same as in the Middle Ages, and the output is even less than before. How do we know this? Because we see from the customs reports that the largest import from foreign countries every year is agricultural products. We Chinese people do not understand modern production methods, but even the greatest skill passed down by our ancestors, the method of farming, is almost lost now. Take Guangdong as an example, Guangdong Province has to take 1 million silver dollars to Siam and Annam to buy rice every year. At the same time, Hunan Province had a lot of rice left over that year, and although the price was cheap, it was not transported due to inconvenient transportation, and it could only be left to rot. Isn't this a very contradictory and strange phenomenon? The origin of this contradictory and dangerous phenomenon is due to the fact that the vast majority of direct producers, the workers and farmers in our country, have no knowledge and are illiterate. Therefore, our urgent task at present is to teach this majority of direct producers to read and improve their knowledge. Therefore, the Shanghai Municipal Government announced that it would implement literacy education on July 10th of this year, and designated today, May 1st, as the opening day of the Literacy Education Promotion Week and the inauguration ceremony for the directors of the district offices and the heads of the literacy education service groups. The significance of this is evident. Among the 450 million compatriots in China, 80% are illiterate. Even in the Shanghai urban area, which has the advantage of being at the forefront of the country and is the cultural and economic center of the country, 30% are illiterate. This is the greatest shame of our nation, the greatest stain on our nation, and the root cause of national humiliation and the most serious national crisis in history. In other words, national humiliation and national crisis are caused and formed by the shame of having 80% of the people illiterate. People across the country, especially patriotic people, are running around and shouting slogans every day to wash away national humiliation and save the country from crisis. But the fundamental plan to wash away national humiliation and save the country is to solve the problem of illiteracy of 80% of the people in the country first, and in Shanghai, to solve the problem of illiteracy of 30% of the people in the city first. If the people of the whole country can make concerted efforts to solve the problem of illiteracy of 80% of the people in the country, then they can wash away national humiliation and save the country. At the same time, we must also be able to make concerted efforts to solve the problem of illiteracy of 30% of the people in Shanghai, so that we can look forward to the prosperity and development of Shanghai. None of us are born literate, and none of us are born with knowledge. But why do some people have the opportunity to receive education, and some people do not have the opportunity to receive education? Why do some people have knowledge, and some people do not have knowledge? Why do some people have food to eat, and some people do not have food to eat? Why do some people sit and have food to eat, and some people have to work all day to have food to eat? This is entirely due to the different circumstances of their families, social environments, and personal experiences, which have led to these differences. We have the opportunity to receive education and have food to eat. Most of these superior opportunities are given to us by society. For example, when comparing Shanghai with the inland areas, the inland areas have more than 80% illiterate people, while Shanghai only has 30%. This is not because the people in the inland areas are less talented than those in Shanghai, but because the people in Shanghai have better opportunities to receive education than those in the inland areas. But we must know that it is meaningless for a small number of people to receive education and become literate. If a small number of people can live a stable life, but the majority of people cannot live a stable life, then the lives of the small number of people will not be stable in the end. Therefore, since a small number of us have these opportunities, we should be aware of them, not fail to live up to them, and cherish them. That is, the small number of literate people must be responsible for teaching the majority of illiterate people, and must make direct and indirect efforts to find ways to stabilize and improve the lives of the majority of people. Shanghai has a relatively concentrated talent pool, relatively abundant financial resources, and relatively complete facilities, and has a variety of superior positions and environments. This time, when we promote literacy education, we must make it a success and never let it fail. Because the success or failure of Shanghai's literacy education is directly related to the success or failure of the national literacy education movement. Shanghai has such a superior position and environment. If the literacy movement cannot succeed and ends in failure, then the literacy education movement in other parts of the country will not only fail to succeed, but also will not be able to be promoted. Therefore, this time, Shanghai's literacy education must be successful. The success or failure of this is related to our entire country and nation. At the same time, whether Shanghai's promotion is effective this time can also test whether our Shanghai intellectual class, especially those in the education sector, can fulfill their natural duty to teach illiterate people, and can also test whether the Shanghai Kuomintang comrades can work hard on the basic task of national rejuvenation, the literacy education movement, and can also test whether the city's civil servants are earnestly promoting it. Therefore, this literacy education movement requires the mobilization of all, whether it is the intellectual class, the education sector, the Kuomintang comrades, or the civil servants, to earnestly take on this responsibility, work hard to promote it, and must promote it effectively. I sincerely follow the intellectual class, the education sector, all the comrades in the city, and all the civil servants in the city to fulfill my personal obligations and fulfill my personal natural duty. I hope that the citizens of the city will unanimously and earnestly promote the literacy movement in order to achieve the complete success of this movement."</p>
<p>Tong's Speech Then, the representative of the Municipal Party Headquarters, Tong Xingbai, delivered a speech, saying, "Everyone, today you are holding the inauguration ceremony. I have a few opinions and contributions. (1) Today, you are all people in the education sector, great people in the education sector, who can give people sufficient knowledge and skills and enable them to survive in the world. However, literacy education is different from ordinary education, because the target of education is different. The difficulty and promotion of literacy education should be known to all. We must break through the difficulties and enable them to read. Its greatness should be even greater than trying our best in ordinary education. Today, in addition to bearing the responsibility of striving for ordinary education, you also bear the mission of promoting literacy education, so you will definitely be able to exert its full greatness in the future. This is what the education sector itself should strive for. (2) Today's society must not be selfish and self-interested. If the country and the nation have one more member and get nothing, then I am no different from weeds and rotten things. We must seek the happiness of the whole society in addition to seeking our own survival. This is the meaning of life, and in the cause of seeking the happiness of the whole society, promoting literacy education is the most urgent task. Because making the illiterate literate and giving the opportunity to those who do not have the opportunity to become literate is the meaning of life that everyone should strive for. Literacy education is one of the seven movements of our party, and it is also the central work of the Water Party. This time, the municipal government has mobilized many talents with great determination. The Municipal Party Headquarters will also do its best for this movement. In addition to assisting the municipal government, the district party headquarters and district branches will establish literacy schools, and various social organizations will also establish schools. If so, there will be more than 2,000 schools in total. This is the Municipal Party Headquarters assisting in promoting the literacy education in this city." After Tong's speech, a group photo was taken and the meeting was adjourned.</p>
<p>Radio Broadcast Promotion Yesterday, the second day, was Radio Broadcast Promotion Day. Starting at nine o'clock in the morning, the Literacy Education Broadcasting Conference was held at the Sino-Western Radio Station. The chairman was Tao Baichuan, the master of ceremonies was Chen Dabei, and the receptionists were Lu Hailan, Ding Shoutang, Xu Gongyi, Cheng Fengxiang, Yuan Zengyu, Sun Yucai, Chen Tingzhen, and Weng Muliang. Literacy slogans were hung high at the entrance of the Sino-Western Radio Station, and Guanshengyuan specially prepared refreshments to entertain the broadcasters.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report The opening ceremony was held at nine o'clock in the morning. Chairman Tao Baichuan gave a report, saying, "Today is the first day of Promotion Week, Radio Broadcast Promotion Day. There are three types of people in society today. The first type of people do not understand the meaning of literacy education and the methods we are promoting. The second type of people are skeptical or opposed to literacy education. The third type of people already understand literacy education, but are unwilling to actively participate. Therefore, we must publicize to make the first type of people understand, the second type of people agree, and the third type of people participate. This is the purpose of this association's publicity. The content of the literacy education we are running includes three types: literacy education, common sense guidance, and civic training. The promotion methods are divided into two types. The first type is to set up 220 literacy schools, each school runs six classes, a total of 1,320 classes, each class enrolls 50 people, graduates in two months, reads one hour a day, and it is estimated that 400,000 illiterate people can become literate in a year. The textbook has been compiled, and the content is simple and interesting. The second type is to organize a literacy education service group. All middle school students and older elementary school students participate, and there will be a total of 10,000 members. After giving them appropriate training, they will go to various places to guide and teach people to read. Each person teaches at least two illiterate people in two months, and can also teach more than 100,000 people in a year. In this way, with both sides proceeding, all illiterate people in Shanghai can be eliminated in one year."</p>

<p>General Assembly Passes Five Important Proposals</p>
<p>On the morning of May 1st, International Labor Day, the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions convened the city's labor community at the auditorium of the new meeting hall in Meijialong, Xiaonanmen, to hold a commemorative meeting. At the same time, the labor community held a literacy movement promotion day, with an unusually enthusiastic and grand occasion. Details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Participating Representatives陸京士 from the Municipal Party Headquarters Executive Committee, Zhu Xuefan, Chairman of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, Standing Committee Member Shao Xubai, Li Mengnan of the Soap and Medicine Workers' Union, Zhou Xuexiang of the Fourth District Cigarette Workers' Union, Zhao Zhenhui of the Pharmaceutical Industry Union, Ding Changyan of the First District Water and Electricity Workers' Union, Long Peiyun of the First District Shipbuilding Workers' Union, and over 300 people from the Garment, Woodworking, Auto Drivers, Winemaking, Tea Making, Silk Reeling, Knitting, Medicine Trade, Fifth District Cotton Spinning, Sixth District Water and Electricity, and other industries, as well as all students from the Labor Movement Training Institute, etc., with Zhu Xuefan, Zhou Xuexiang, and Li Mengnan as the presidium, Zhao Zhenhui as the master of ceremonies, and Fang Rusheng as the recorder.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report After the ceremonial proceedings, Chairman Zhu Xuefan gave a report, stating, "May 1st Labor Day is the day when European and American workers, in order to seek equality and liberation, achieved the realization of the three-eight system after repeated struggles. The status and personality of workers began to be valued. Today, the three-eight system has almost become universal and is recognized as a reasonable principle. This should be attributed to the hard work of the martyrs, which is indelible and forever worthy of our commemoration and praise. Especially in today's China, we should have a true understanding. First, we deeply know that the working class is built on reason. To know reason, we must first be literate, and then we can generate strength. Therefore, we should seek progress in education, cultivation, and health. Second, to relieve workers, in addition to education, cultivation, and health, there must be work to do. Liang Rengong said, 'Education is to teach people to be human, to be modern people.' Although workers are not necessarily standing in front of the times, they should also progress according to the times. Workers themselves should pay attention to the importance of labor education. According to domestic statistics, an average of 80% are illiterate. We should be aware of this and work hard on education in order to consolidate our own position, so as not to lose the original meaning of the commemoration."</p>
<p>Lu and Zhou Speeches Then, Lu Jingshi, a member of the Municipal Party Committee, gave a speech, saying, "May 1st Labor Day originated in 1884. At that time, capitalists in the United States and Europe oppressed and enslaved workers. Therefore, for the sake of livelihood, workers put forward the reasonable demand of eight hours of work, eight hours of rest, and eight hours of education. After a lot of struggle and sacrifice, the brilliant and glorious May 1st Labor Day was created. The target of European and American workers is the capitalists, so resistance is easy. Looking at our country, the difference between labor and capital is only a matter of big poverty and small poverty. There are no so-called capitalists. However, the decline of domestic commerce and the closure of factories occur continuously. The reason is that they are being destroyed and occupied by imperialism, which has led to today's phenomenon. I hope that the workers in our country will stand on the position of labor-capital cooperation, work hard to produce, resist the dumping of foreign goods, in order to save the country and revive the nation." Then, Zhou Xuexiang gave a speech, saying, "To make the labor movement flourish and to stabilize the lives of workers, we must have the spirit of hard work and hard work to cope with the environment with our own strength, move forward, and build a solid workers' organization."</p>
<p>Proposals Passed (1) Telegram congratulating Chairman Chiang Kai-shek on the victory in suppressing bandits, (2) Telegram requesting the soldiers at the front of the bandit suppression to eliminate the red bandits as soon as possible, (3) Telegram requesting the workers across the country to work hard to produce and enrich national strength, (4) Telegram requesting the central government to effectively relieve Chinese industry and commerce, (5) Telegram requesting the central government to order all provinces and cities to implement compulsory education for workers, (6) Telegram requesting the central government to expand workers' organizations.</p>
<p>Slogans and Banners (1) All workers in the city unite as one, (2) Celebrate the heroic and enthusiastic May 1st International Labor Day, (3) Our country must create China's Labor Day, (4) Commemorating May 1st requires promoting literacy education, (5) Commemorating May 1st requires fulfilling military and national training, (6) Commemorating May 1st requires practicing the New Life Movement, (7) Commemorating May 1st requires increasing production and enriching national strength, (8) Long live the Chinese Kuomintang, (9) Long live the Republic of China, (10) Long live the Shanghai Municipal Federation of Trade Unions. In the afternoon, variety shows were performed.</p>

<p>After Shanghai's industrial and commercial sectors settled their debts at the end of the fourth quarter, thanks to the interbank lending handled by the Central, China, and Communications Banks, they safely weathered the storm. Various industries are hoping that the 20 million yuan relief loan will be implemented as soon as possible. The Money Trade Association held the 19th regular meeting of the second session of member representatives yesterday and resolved to join the credit guarantee lending. Details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Attending Representatives Yesterday's member representative meeting of the Money Trade Association was attended by representatives of more than 60 money shops, including Fuyuan, Fukang, Futai, Baofeng, Hongsheng, Hongxiang, Qingda, Shenyuan, Dade, Yida, Hengxun, Yida, Zhicheng, Henglong, Yimao, Shunkang, Yuansheng, Tongrun, Xinfu, Henglai, Wufeng, Ankang, Tongyu, Jintai, Hengxing, Huichang, Tongqing, Xinyu, Yisheng, Yichang, Gengyu, and Jukang, etc., including Qin Runqing, Zheng Bingquan, Li Shoushan, Chen Shengwu, Pei Yunqing, Qian Yuansheng, Liu Wuqiao, Xi Jiming, Gan Huailian, Xiao Shanshan, Shao Yanshan, Zhang Mengzhou, and more than 100 other people.</p>

<p>Resolutions of Various Cases Discussion items: (1) Please make a public decision on the interbank interest rate for April. Resolution: Three yuan. (2) According to the letter from the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, please discuss and decide on how to handle the opening of the Inner Garden for public tours in accordance with the order of the Municipal Government. Resolution: Automatically open every Sunday. (3) According to the order from the Ministry of Finance, recently, there have been frequent cases of money shops going bankrupt and liquidating. After investigating the inside story, it is not purely due to the stagnation of loans. There are often bad managers who abuse and embezzle funds, or engage in private fraud and embezzlement, using bankruptcy and liquidation as a means of covering up robbery. Outsiders do not know the truth and think that the closure of money shops is a sign of financial strain, which shakes people's hearts and affects the market. It is extremely hateful. Please investigate the details of the money shops that have recently gone bankrupt and suspended business. If there are any of the above-mentioned circumstances, report them to the Ministry truthfully so that they can be investigated and dealt with according to law. Resolution: Notify all member money shops to comply, and send a letter to the liquidators of the member money shops that have already closed down to reply to the inquiries. (4) According to the order from the Ministry of Finance, please copy and distribute the ten principles of lending and instruct this association to handle them together. Please discuss and decide on how to handle them. Resolution: Approve joining the credit lending of 250,000 yuan, which will be undertaken by the member money shops on average.</p>

<p>Staying in Shanghai for Three Days Before Going to Hangzhou, Returning to Shanghai to Proceed to Beijing and Various Other Locations</p>
<p>The Guangdong Provincial Government, in order to understand the conditions of civil administration, economy, construction, and education in various provinces and cities across the country, has specially organized a Guangdong Provincial Government Inspection Delegation to visit various provinces and cities for the purpose of learning and drawing lessons. The delegation, led by Li Yupei and comprising eleven members, arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon at 1:00 PM aboard the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's "Haili" ship, docking at Jinliyuan Wharf. Chen Jitang's representative in Beijing, Yang Dezhao, and others welcomed them at the port. After disembarking, the delegation members checked into the New Asia Hotel and plan to stay in Shanghai for three days, visiting the construction of the Greater Shanghai Plan before proceeding to cities such as Beijing and Hangzhou for inspection. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Delegation Members Arriving in Shanghai The delegation consists of thirteen members in total. Those who arrived in Shanghai yesterday include Li Yupei, Li Getian, Zhong Shenglin, Zhang Gangqun, Deng Runkang, Song Dejian, Zeng Guoguang, He Zhongchun, Du Zhanjin, Chen Zonghai, and Wen Kewei, totaling eleven individuals. Li Huaishuang and Ma Pei are still in Guangdong preparing everything. Li and Ma will be traveling to Tibet for inspection, so they are scheduled to go to Hong Kong within days and take a ship to India before entering Tibet for inspection.</p>
<p>Inspection Itinerary After arriving in Shanghai yesterday, the delegation plans to stay in Shanghai for three days to inspect everything. They are also scheduled to visit the central urban area this morning to see the construction plan of Greater Shanghai. After completing the inspection in Shanghai, they will proceed to Hangzhou, and then from Hangzhou, they will go to various counties in Zhejiang Province to inspect the construction of highways and other infrastructure in the province. After completing the inspection in Zhejiang Province, they will take the route through Shanghai to Beijing, and then travel north along the Tianjin-Pukou Railway to Jinan, Qingdao, Tianjin, and Beiping for inspection. After that, they will travel west from Beiping to Taiyuan, Xi'an, and Luoyang, and then south to Hankou, Changsha, and Hunan Province for inspection. After completing the inspection in Hunan, they will travel east along the Yangtze River to Jiujiang and Nanchang, and are scheduled to return to the province from Jiangxi. The inspection period is two months.</p>
<p>Current Situation in Guangdong Province Yesterday, a reporter from the Central News Agency visited the delegation at the New Asia Hotel and inquired about the inspection mission. Delegation member Li Yupei responded as follows: Since the implementation of the three-year plan in Guangdong Province, two and a half years have passed. In order to understand the actual situation of civil administration and construction in various provinces and cities across the country, and to learn from it, the Guangdong Provincial Government Inspection Delegation was organized. The scope of the inspection includes four aspects: finance, civil administration, construction, and education in various provinces and cities. As for rumors that the inspection involves military affairs, those are not confirmed information. The inspection period and itinerary have already been determined as mentioned earlier. Li continued to describe the current status of the three-year construction plan in Guangdong Province, saying that the three-year construction plan in Guangdong Province is now 80% complete. The three-year plan originally planned to establish 24 factories within the three-year period, and 20 have now been established, including three sugar factories, two in Guangzhou and one in Huizhou, and it is also planned to establish two factories each in Chaozhou and Shantou, one fertilizer factory, two cement factories, one ammonium acetate factory, one alcohol factory, one soda factory, and one textile factory. The textile factory is further divided into four factories, including cotton and silk (already established), linen and wool (to be established). Other projects such as steel factories, hydropower plants, etc., are all in the planning stage. In terms of Guangdong's finances, the annual revenue is 100 million, while the expenditure reaches 110 million, with a shortfall of 10 million. This is all due to the establishment of a large number of factories, which is expected to be offset in the future. Guangdong's tax revenue also follows the central government's strict implementation of abolishing excessive taxes and miscellaneous levies, and has now abolished more than 200 types of excessive taxes and miscellaneous levies. As for education funds, they were more than 2 million three years ago, and have now more than doubled. Therefore, production schools and vocational schools in the province are no longer as rare as they used to be. Regarding Guangdong's finances, the authorities, due to insufficient financial revenue and expenditure, and the abolition of excessive taxes and miscellaneous levies, plan to levy a temporary land tax. In terms of construction, more than 37,000 kilometers of highways have been built, and long-distance telephones have reached more than 40,000 li. Other construction projects are also in active progress.</p>
<h3 id="e122">Polish National Day Today <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>Polish Consul General Hosts Reception for All Sectors; Mr. Wei Dentao Went to Beijing the Night Before Last</p>
<p>Today (May 3rd) is the Polish National Day. All Polish expatriates in Shanghai are taking a holiday to celebrate. This morning, a prayer celebration will be held at the church on Avenue Notre Dame. Dr. Gralesinski, Counselor of the Polish Embassy in China and concurrently Consul General in Shanghai, has specifically scheduled a reception at his private residence on Dilaunay Road from 11:30 AM to 12:30 PM today, inviting Chinese and foreign officials to attend. Wu Tiecheng, the Mayor of Shanghai, Zhao Tiezhang and Zhang Mengling, representatives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Shanghai, and consuls of various countries in Shanghai will all attend to offer congratulations. The Polish Expatriate Committee has scheduled a banquet for Polish expatriates in Shanghai at 6:30 PM today. Poland's first constitution was the oldest among all countries in the world, and May 3rd is the anniversary of the promulgation of the first national unified constitution in 1791. After that, Poland fell into difficult circumstances and soon suffered the pain of partition. However, patriotic people rose up to save the country and struggled tirelessly. It was not until the national hero and current Minister of the Army, Piłsudski, came to the fore and led the national salvation work that an independent government was finally established in 1918, and all the Polish people regained their freedom. Under the leadership of Piłsudski, Poland continued to work hard on construction, and its progress has been extremely rapid in recent years. As of today, Poland has become a powerful country in the world in terms of politics and economy. The relationship between China and Poland has always been very friendly, and the commercial relationship between the two countries has also been increasing year by year. The recent arrival of the Polish commercial training ship "Dar Pomorza" and the Polish goods display ship in China further proves the close friendship between the two countries. In addition, the Polish Minister Wei Dentao went to Beijing the night before last and is scheduled to host a reception in Beijing today for President Wang, heads of various ministries and commissions, and ministers of various countries in Beijing to celebrate the country's National Day.</p>

<h3 id="e124">Overseas Chinese Federation Publishes the Truth about the Anti-Chinese Situation in Siam <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>Three Million Overseas Chinese Compatriots Will Become Aliens; It Is Hoped That the Government Will Negotiate and Conclude a Commercial Treaty Quickly</p>
<p>The Overseas Chinese Federation yesterday published the truth about the anti-Chinese situation in Siam and its response methods. The text states: China and Siam have deep relations in terms of culture, economy, and even blood relations. There are now more than 3 million Overseas Chinese in Siam, accounting for more than a quarter of the total population of Siam, and accounting for one-third of the total number of Overseas Chinese in the world. However, China and Siam have not yet established formal diplomatic relations, so the Siamese government only has unilateral actions in dealing with Overseas Chinese, with no bilateral consultations at all. Therefore, matters of excluding Overseas Chinese are often heard. When the new Siamese government was established, it recognized the great power of the Overseas Chinese and decided to implement various anti-Chinese policies and promulgate them as laws and regulations. If these policies are indeed implemented, Overseas Chinese will have no place to stand in Siam within a few years. The most important anti-Chinese policies of the Siamese government are listed below:</p>
<p>Promulgation of the New Immigration Law Siam's first immigration law was promulgated in 1927, stipulating that Overseas Chinese residents pay an entry tax of five Siamese cents, plus a handling fee of six cents and five thousandths, and restricting those suffering from eye diseases from entering the country. The immigration law was revised in 1931, increasing the entry tax to ten cents, plus a handling fee of twelve cents and fifty tenths, and also levying a residence tax of thirty cents. Overseas Chinese leaving Siam had to pay back the Siamese passport fee of five cents, and were limited to returning to Siam within two years, otherwise they would be treated as new immigrants. The second revision of the immigration law in 1933 increased the residence fee to one hundred cents, and the return to Siam passport fee was also increased to twenty cents, and the time limit was changed to one year, and those who were illiterate were restricted from entering the country. Recently, there have been even more intensified news.</p>
<p>Destruction of Overseas Chinese Industry and Commerce In recent years, the commercial regulations promulgated have restricted the operation of Overseas Chinese exchange businesses, pawnshops, second-hand goods businesses, and rickshaw businesses, or levied heavy taxes. Recently, the People's Party has been in power, and the crackdown has been even more severe. The Ministry of Internal Affairs has now been established, and has drafted a new economic plan. Although it has not been fully implemented, in May of last year, the Siamese government planned to establish a large state-run fire brigade and planned to nationalize the fire brigades and rice mills in the country. (According to statistics, Overseas Chinese account for 90% of the operation of Siamese rice mills.) In addition, the newly promulgated fisheries regulations restrict non-Siamese from operating, causing tens of thousands of Overseas Chinese industrial and commercial people engaged in fishing to lose their jobs. (3) Implementation of</p>
<p>Assimilation Policy In 1918, the Siamese government promulgated the Private School Regulations, stipulating that Overseas Chinese-run schools, in addition to registering with the Siamese Ministry of Education, the principal must have a Siamese high school sophomore qualification. There are very few qualified Overseas Chinese, so the principals of each school are all Siamese. Teachers must pass the examination before they can be employed. In 1932, the Compulsory Education Regulations were promulgated, stipulating that children aged seven to fourteen (including Overseas Chinese children) should all enter compulsory schools. All Chinese schools must, as usual, teach Siamese language for 25 hours per week. In 1933, it was further stipulated that students who should receive compulsory education should all be transferred to Siamese schools and should no longer enter Chinese schools. The crackdown on Chinese school teachers has become more and more severe. In addition to stipulating that they must first pass the Siamese language and examination, they must also fill out their resumes, submit certificates and diplomas, and submit fingerprints of all ten fingers. In fact, it has not been applied to schools run by British, French, American, and Japanese personnel. Last year, they even used the excuse that the Siamese language of the school teachers was unqualified and the management was not good.</p>
<p>Closing More Than Sixty Chinese Schools The above three points can be seen that the anti-Chinese policy of the Siamese government is truly all-encompassing and step-by-step. The implementation of the first point of the New Immigration Law means that Chinese entering the country need 200 Chinese currency per person, including boat fare, and must be literate. Because most of the Chinese who go to Siam are laborers, most of them are illiterate and cannot afford this heavy fee. I ask how many people can still go to the South Seas? Therefore, since the promulgation of the immigration law, the number of Chinese entering the country has greatly decreased, which is the actual proof. As for the second item, after the implementation of the so-called new economic policy, the most affected is the fire battle industry. 90% of the rice mill industry in Siam is operated by Chinese, which can also be said to be the largest economic right of Chinese merchants. If the rice mill is nationalized, it is tantamount to completely eliminating the economic status of Overseas Chinese. The assimilation policy in the first item is even more vicious, and the price examples of education for foreign nationals in various countries are also extremely</p>
<p>Absurd and Unparalleled Internationally, there has never been a case where foreign education is not allowed to set up schools and teach their own languages ​​and characters. The Siamese government's move directly closes Chinese schools completely and makes hundreds of thousands of Chinese children learn to be Siamese and forget the culture of their motherland. Its cruelty is truly unparalleled. The Siamese government's exclusion of Overseas Chinese is clearly demonstrated. This time, the Siamese Far East Tourism Corps denied that there was any anti-Chinese matter and dared not explicitly state the truth of its implementation of various laws and regulations. It is probably because they know that the reasoning is weak. What is strange is that our government does not care about these more than 3 million Overseas Chinese. Since the late Qing Dynasty for hundreds of years, it has not established diplomatic relations with Siam, allowing the Siamese government to unilaterally approve and implement the exclusion policy. It is a rare phenomenon in the world. On the government side, or because our country has informally proposed to the Siamese government to conclude a treaty of diplomatic relations, the government ignores it, so it has not been implemented. In fact, China and Siam should not only have such a large</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese Issue Should seek a proper solution, that is, to discuss the trade between the two countries, at a minimum, there must be a commercial treaty concluded, because the Siamese government regards rice production as a major demonstration, accounting for 50% of the total export goods, and the number imported into our country is the largest. According to the statistical report of the Siamese government's Ministry of Commerce, in 1933, Siamese rice imported into China and Hong Kong accounted for more than 60% of its total exports, and in 1934, imports into China and Hong Kong also accounted for 34% of its total exports. Siamese rice actually regards our country as its largest sales market. Recently, the Dutch East Indies, Malaya, and other places have increased import taxes or restricted imports, followed by Japan, which will also control the import of foreign rice. Siamese rice has been greatly hit, so now</p>
<p>Siamese Rice Sales Have to rely on our country as its last resort, that is, the general public opinion in Siam and the insightful people in the government and the opposition also advocate concluding a commercial treaty with our country. If China can use this point to demand the conclusion of a Sino-Siamese treaty, it is not impossible to achieve the goal. In short, the Siamese government's exclusion of Overseas Chinese has reached the most serious period. If our government still delays, it will not only make 2 million Overseas Chinese gradually become aliens, but also make other countries follow suit. How will it be able to stand in the world? All compatriots in the country should pay attention to it. Reported by Xu Shiying of the Relief Committee</p>

Du Yuesheng, the representative of the recipients, gave a thank you speech. Finally, a photo was taken and the ceremony was dismissed.</p>
<p>Xu's Report Xu Shiying, the Chairman of the National Government Relief Affairs Committee, reported that Shiying was ordered by the Central Government to follow the gentlemen of society to manage the relief affairs. In a flash, it has been eight years. I have frequently encountered disasters and deeply feel that my virtue is shallow and my strength is weak, and I cannot provide relief. I am often ashamed and sad. Fortunately, with the efforts and assistance of philanthropists from all walks of life in the country, many people have been saved. Those who are enthusiastic about charity are righteous and courageous, only seeking peace of mind, and do not want to be seen or heard by the world. The government should praise and encourage those who reward good deeds to promote morality. It is recommended that the Shanghai Relief Association review the fundraising and relief funds for the past disasters and report them. According to the report, the former Shanghai Fundraising Association for the Relief of Flood Disasters in Various Provinces, the former Shanghai War Zone Refugee Temporary Relief Association, the former Shanghai Charity Organization Joint Relief Association for Northeastern Refugees, the former Shanghai Fundraising Association for the Temporary Righteous Relief of the Henan, Anhui, and Hubei Disaster Areas, and the former Shanghai Charity Organization Fundraising Association for the Joint Relief of the Yellow River Flood Disaster have repeatedly raised donations from disaster relief donors and opened clear account books. It is requested that preferential awards be given to encourage them. After review and deliberation by the Association, in addition to following the established rules to request awards, gold and silver medals, and plaques, in particular, Mr. Du Yuesheng, Zhang Xiaolin, Huang Jinrong, Han Yungen, Xu Maotang, and Wu Ruiwu, either raised funds for disaster relief and donated more than 200,000 yuan in national currency, or donated more than 50,000 yuan in national currency. The amount was the largest, and it is recommended to request the Jade Award for preferential awards to encourage the world and promote benevolence. Shiying submitted the memorial and requested President Wang of the Executive Yuan to forward it to the National Government for promulgation to show encouragement. President Wang specially approved it and submitted it to the National Government on January 23 of this year. The National Government ordered that Du Yong, Zhang Yin, Huang Jinrong, Han Yungen, and Xu Maotang be awarded the third-class Jade Award, and Wu Ruiwu be awarded the third-class Jade Award. The current help chapter has been issued to Shanghai, and some of it will be held today. A medal awarding ceremony was held in this garden to show the importance. I am very happy that President Wang of the Executive Yuan sent Secretary-General Chu to represent and deliver a speech, and that Mayor Wu Tiecheng and you gentlemen attended the ceremony.</p>
<p>Chairman's Speech Chairman Chu Minyi gave a speech saying that today I am here in Shanghai on behalf of President Wang of the Executive Yuan to participate in the ceremony where you are receiving the awards. I am very honored. In recent years, fires have been prevalent in our country and have spread to almost all provinces. People have been displaced and the situation is extremely tragic. The government has specially established the National Relief Affairs Committee to be responsible for relief. Regarding the raising of relief funds and the handling of distribution, we rely on the joint assistance of people from all walks of life in society. Today, the gentlemen who are receiving the medals have raised more than 200,000 yuan in fundraising during the national drought relief last year. The benefit of relief is very great. Enthusiasm and justice are sufficient to set an example for the country. Now, Chairman Xu has presented a request to the National Government to award medals, sincerely believing that relieving disaster victims is the way to stabilize society, and stabilizing society is the way to defend the country. I hope that you will continue to embody this meaning in the future and strive for various social undertakings. Then the country's commemoration of your achievements will also be endless. I respectfully express a word to congratulate you.</p>
<p>Mayor's Speech Mayor Wu said in his speech, "Today is the day that Du, Zhang, Huang, Han, Xu, and Wu are receiving awards. They have made efforts, so the government is giving them medals to show honor. You are all leaders of Shanghai's society. This award is not only an honor for you, but also an honor for Shanghai. I am fortunate to be the local official of Shanghai and participate in today's award ceremony. I am very touched and comforted. I hope you will continue to work hard and lead all the citizens to serve the society."</p>
<p>Guests' Speeches Guests' representatives Wang Xiaolai and Pan Gongzhan gave speeches one after another. Wang hoped that all wealthy citizens of the city could be as public-spirited and righteous as Du and others, and Pan hoped that Du and others would continue to serve the country and society with the spirit of hard work and good deeds.</p>
<p>Du's Reply At the end, Du Yuesheng, the representative of the recipients, gave a reply. Du first expressed his gratitude for the government's awarding of medals, and then said that this is not the power of us individuals, but the contribution of the enthusiastic support of the entire city.</p>

<p>The city's second group wedding was held at 3:00 PM the day before yesterday (the 1st) in the City Government Auditorium. Mayor Wu Tiecheng delivered a speech, Wu Xingya, the Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, read the marriage certificate, and awarded the marriage certificates and commemorative badges. There were a total of thirty-five new couples. It took one hour to complete the ceremony. The ceremony was simpler and more solemn than the previous one. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>A Glimpse of the Auditorium The interior and exterior of the City Government Auditorium were decorated very luxuriously. A red silk banner was hung at the entrance, with the words "Shanghai's Second Group Wedding Ceremony" inscribed on it. The surrounding stone railings and pillars were decorated with the national emblem and the party-state flag. In the auditorium, steel chairs were arranged in rows for the audience seats. The ceremony table was also decorated with red ribbons, and the tables and chairs were surrounded by embroidered cloths. Red silk drapes were hung on both walls, adorned with golden "囍" characters. In front of the altar, red candles were lit high, and a red carpet was laid in the middle, leading directly to the entrance, and numbered seats were placed for the bride and groom. Before and during the wedding ceremony, the gate was tightly closed and no one was allowed to enter or leave at will.</p>
<p>Crowded Guests Yesterday, many Chinese and foreign guests went to visit. The City Government specially issued viewing tickets. Those with tickets entered through the back door and climbed the stairs from the left. The front gates were guarded by City Government officials and guards. Mayor Wu, Secretary-General Yu, and Wu Xingya, the Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, also personally directed the event. By 3:00 PM, more and more people came, and the seats were full. Many people who came later returned. The empty space in front of the City Government was also surrounded by ropes, and about a thousand people stood and watched.</p>
<p>Newcomers Enter the Seats At about 3:00 PM, the band played the wedding march. The newcomers then came out of the dressing room, men on the left and women on the right, slowly climbing the stairs. Zhang Binghui and his wife led the way, followed by nine boys and nine girls from WanZhu Elementary School, holding brocade boxes, lanterns, palace lanterns, bright horns, incense burners, etc. When they reached the entrance, the gate opened sadly, and the guests stood up to greet them, slowly entered the hall, took their seats and stood.</p>
<p>Wedding Situation During the ceremony, the most respectful salute was first paid to the party-state flag and the portrait of the Premier. Then the bride and groom stood opposite each other to perform the wedding ceremony. Then the names were called one by one to go to the altar to receive the certificate and commemorative badge, and salute the officiant before retiring. Finally, Director Wu read the marriage certificate and the Mayor gave a speech. The wedding ceremony was then completed. All the married people saluted the officiant, and then they walked out of the auditorium shoulder to shoulder. The music started again, mixed with the sound of firecrackers, and they took a photo in front of the empty space and dispersed. It took only about an hour for the wedding ceremony, which was simpler and more solemn than the previous one.</p>

<h3 id="e129">The Public Works Bureau and the Shanghai Gas Company Concluded a Franchise Contract <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>Term of Forty Years</p>
<p>Since 1916, the Shanghai Gas Company has paid the Public Works Bureau 1,000 taels of silver every year. In recent years, gas street lights have almost disappeared, and the use of gas is mainly for household use. The Public Works Bureau has decided that the time has come to regulate the company's business with a franchise contract. Therefore, in March of this year, it concluded a contract with the company, which has been implemented since January 1 of this year. The main terms are that after the company's gross income from gas sales in the Concession and roads outside the Concession, after deducting the annuity payable to the Chinese authorities, 5% should be reported to the Public Works Bureau and paid every six months. The contract is for a term of forty years. Every ten years, the Public Works Bureau may notify the company one year in advance to purchase the company's business and real estate in the Concession. The purchase price will be properly settled by both parties at that time, or publicly assessed by arbitrators. The detailed terms of the contract will be published in today's Public Works Bureau Municipal Gazette.</p>
<h3 id="e130">Pudong Yangjiadu China Merchants Bureau - Barge Owners Scuffle Over Cargo Transportation <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>Zhou Lin's Violent Actions Lead to Major Disaster; Yang Zhanglin's Bones Broken, Life in Critical Condition</p>
<p>Around 9:00 AM on the morning of the day before yesterday, a major case of armed fighting and severe injury occurred in front of the warehouse of the China Merchants Bureau wharf in Yangjiadu, Pudong. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Cause of the Dispute: Zhou Linsheng, the head of a barge fleet, owns over ten barges and contracts for the transportation of soybean and soybean cake for the Changde Oil Factory. This spring, Zhou Qiang wanted the Changde Oil Factory to increase the barge transportation wages, but they were not approved. Therefore, the factory terminated the contract and selected another barge operator, Chen, to take over the contract. Zhou harbored resentment towards Chen for seizing his business and publicly threatened to kill Chen.</p>
<p>Details of the Assault: Around 9:00 AM on the morning of the day before yesterday, Chen, under the orders of the factory, instructed his crew member Yang Zhanglin (55 years old, from Pudong) to go to the China Merchants Bureau warehouse in Yangjiadu, Pudong, to load soybeans. Zhou found out about this and ordered his chief steward, nicknamed "Little Old Third" Jin Sheng, to gather over ten Shandong workers, each armed with iron bars and other weapons. They went to the wharf and held Yang down. They first knocked him to the ground, and then violently struck Yang's chest and back with iron bars, breaking several ribs and back bones. Yang immediately fell to the ground, unconscious. The warehouse clerk urgently blew the police whistle, and the police arrived and arrested "Little Old Third" Jin Sheng. Zhou Linsheng and others managed to escape.</p>
<p>Life in Critical Condition: In addition to detaining and sending the suspect to the Yangjiadu Public Security Bureau, the police sent the injured person to Pudong Hospital. The doctor determined that the injuries were severe and life-threatening and transferred him to the Qu-surname trauma hospital in Puxi for treatment. However, his leg bones were already broken, and he was spitting up blood non-stop. Furthermore, Yang is already in his sixties, and he has fainted several times yesterday, and his life is feared to be in danger.</p>
<p>Transfer to Court: The Chief of the Yangjiadu Public Security Bureau interrogated the suspect "Little Old Third" Jin Sheng. As the matter concerned injury, he immediately prepared a document to transfer the suspect to the District Court. After a preliminary hearing by the duty prosecutor, he ordered the suspect to be detained, pending an examination of Yang's injuries before further legal action. Meanwhile, warrants were issued to apprehend the principal offender and accomplices for thorough investigation.</p>
<h3 id="e131">Over Sixty Organizations Jointly Petition the Public Works Department, Opposing Telephone Price Increase <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>Requesting the Board of Directors to Reconsider, Minimum Requirement is to Postpone Implementation</p>
<p>The Shanghai First and Second Special District Citizens' Federation, along with its district branches, the Chinese National Products Manufacturers Federation, and various hometown associations, totaling over sixty organizations, are concerned that the issue of telephone price increases has not been resolved, causing anxiety among users and hindering commercial development. They have jointly signed a letter to the Board of Directors of the Public Works Department to continue their efforts to oppose the price increase. The letter states: To the Esteemed Board of Directors, regarding the Shanghai Telephone Company of the Public Concession,</p>
<p>Repeated Price Increases: The Chinese and foreign people within the concession have repeatedly expressed their opposition. Our federation and other organizations, as representatives of citizens and various business sectors, have each expressed our firm opposition based on the opinions of our members and the public. However, the matter has not reached a conclusion, causing anxiety among users and preventing them from using telephones as they wish. The effectiveness of telephones has been diminishing invisibly, hindering communication to an extreme. Therefore, we dare to jointly send this letter to your esteemed board, presenting the simple reasons as follows: (1) The current situation in Shanghai has reached a state of extreme decline. Few businesses can barely maintain their operations. Further increasing the burden is unbearable. The Shanghai Telephone Company already has profits to gain and is in a better position than ordinary businesses. It should share the hardships with its users and should not necessarily achieve its budgeted goals by raising prices again. (2) Telephones are a public utility, with the purpose of facilitating the public. Profits should be limited. Regardless of whether it is in China or foreign countries, there is no public utility that must guarantee a certain level of profit. Why does the Shanghai Telephone Company make such a harsh demand, and why does your bureau allow it? Furthermore, a contract has been signed allowing them to repeatedly increase prices. Although we are not aware of the exact wording of the contract, your Director-General stated that "failure to allow the price increase would damage credibility." We believe that the fulfillment of this contract should be subject to the opinions of the majority of users and be changed according to the social environment. It should be treated as an exception to ordinary contracts. (3) Furthermore, how does the Shanghai Telephone Company's</p>
<p>Profit and Loss Actually Look? Before ordinary users have the opportunity to truly understand its actual contents, it is difficult to believe that the company needs to raise prices. (4) The Shanghai Telephone Company has declared that it needs to raise prices due to excessive capital investment and high expenses. However, according to commercial practice, the higher the price, the more difficult it is to sell. It is better to have small profits and quick turnover to promote sales. The company only knows how to spend money on advertising and promotion but cannot see that it can increase profits by reducing prices. This is a clumsy plan. As for expenses, they may not be impossible to reduce. (5) The price increase method, calculated by the number of calls, is even more unlimited. According to our investigation of the actual usage of various users, the cost will exceed the original price by two or three times. Although your bureau has not yet approved it, allowing it to increase by 125 is in fact also unbearable for users. We request your bureau to reconsider. At a minimum, it must be changed to postpone implementation. (6) The so-called</p>
<p>Postponing Implementation: Of course, it means that your bureau should negotiate with the Shanghai Telephone Company to delay the price increase until a certain number of months or years later. In any case, it cannot be approved for the company to retroactively charge the new price, even if your bureau allows the company to approve it on a certain date, it must still retroactively charge the new price from April 1 of this year. In short, the directors of your bureau are indeed talented and wise men, who represent the taxpayers of the concession and govern the municipality. However, the actual situation of the people may not be fully known. We ask the directors to adopt the opinions of the people, weigh the importance of the matter, and not lightly agree to the demands of one company while disregarding the hardships of the majority of users. Otherwise, regardless of whether they are telephone users, all taxpayers in the Public Concession, for the sake of past suffering and future welfare, may have unfortunate events occur that we do not want to mention and that the directors do not want to hear. The harm will not only be limited to the Shanghai Telephone Company alone. We hope you will understand this and make a decisive decision to quickly determine a solution to continue communication and promote public welfare. To the Board of Directors of the Shanghai Public Concession Public Works Department,</p>

<p>Aurora University, located at the intersection of Ningbo Road and Route Tenant de May, in the French Concession, is established by the French Municipal Council to specifically educate Chinese children. About a week ago, the patrolling Annamese police discovered a blazing red light on the roof of the school at night and mistook it for a fire. It seemed to be coming from the back. The police immediately went to De Xing Li behind the school to check and found no fire. For the sake of security, the police reported to the police station, which notified the fire brigade to rush to the scene to check, but there was still nothing unusual. However, the red light was still sometimes bright and sometimes dim, and some busybodies passing by immediately started rumors that red light ghost fire had been discovered on the upper floor of Aurora University, sometimes bright and sometimes dim. As a result, hundreds of passersby have been stopping to watch every night in recent days. The rumors started and grew from sunset to late at night, with the number of viewers increasing. According to the school's faculty and staff, who are all Catholic priests, there are lights on the upper floor. Recently, the wind has been blowing on the red glass windows, and the firelight reflected on the glass, leading to this rumor. The night before last, the French police sent Chinese, Western, and Annamese police to block the section of Ningbo Road from Bali Bridge Road to Route Tenant de May, preventing pedestrians from passing. At the same time, they notified the school to close the windows, and the red light disappeared, and the rumors also subsided.</p>

<p>The day before yesterday afternoon, a tourist from the Netherlands, named Yalfen (transliteration), called the China Travel Service from the International Hotel on Jing'an Temple Road, requesting them to send someone to accompany him to visit various scenic spots in the city. The travel service sent an employee, Ni Guangxun, to meet him. They hired a Liley Company car to tour the city center. Around 4:00 PM, they went to the Baotaiwan in Wusong to sightsee. After resting at the Fuzhi Hotel, they walked to the Wusong Outer Road, intending to take the city ferry back to Shanghai. However, when they reached the vicinity of the Water Patrol Team, he suddenly fell to the ground, injuring his nose. Wu Song, the chief of the police station, Fu Zhenbei, Xinggang, passed by and saw the situation. He immediately ordered a car to take him to the health clinic for treatment. Attempts at artificial respiration proved ineffective, and he died around 5:00 PM. Subsequently, a Dutch passport, a silver cigarette case, a pair of glasses, two gold rings, two leather wallets, a diary, a bunch of keys, nine dollars and ninety cents, and ten cents were found on the deceased. All of these items were taken to the police station. The China Travel Service was notified to report to the Dutch consulate. A local guarantor was ordered to report to the District Court for an examination. Yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, the court sent prosecutor Li Fen to Wusong for an examination. The result confirmed that the death was due to a sudden illness. Subsequently, the Dutch consulate sent a representative with a letter to Wusong Police Station to claim the body. Chief Fu approved the request, and the body was transported to Shanghai for coffining.</p>

<p>The Third Trial Concludes with a Fine of Two Thousand Dollars and a Prison Sentence of One Year and Four Months</p>
<p>Xu Changrong, a local resident nicknamed "Xu Xiao Kai," who lives at 423 Rue Lanville, Tangjiawan, French Concession, and runs a physical store, is 34 years old this year. He was arrested by the French police in the autumn of the 22nd year of the Republic of China for jointly organizing a lottery gambling house and serving as the accountant. He was prosecuted by the Second Special Court and sentenced to one year and six months in prison and fined two thousand dollars. Xu disagreed with the original verdict and appealed. He was detained in the Second Special Court Detention Center. Due to illness, he requested the Third High Branch Court to stop the detention. He was ordered to pay a cash guarantee of four thousand dollars and provide a surety who would be available at any time. After being released on bail, the case was to be enforced, but Xu avoided appearing in court. It was decided to confiscate the guarantee money and issue an arrest warrant, which has been reported in previous newspapers. Separately, the Third High Branch Court issued another arrest warrant and sent police to arrest Xu's guarantor, Yao Gui, and detain him, setting a deadline for Xu to be handed over to the court. At this point, Xu realized that harming others and himself could not be resolved by hiding. Suddenly, yesterday, Xu voluntarily reported to the Third High Branch Court to request execution. The execution court of the High Court, presided over by Judge Pan Peien, opened the court and ordered Xu Changrong to be brought to court. After briefly questioning his age and origin, the court announced the third trial verdict, which was still one year and six months in prison. After deducting the number of days previously detained in the detention center, with two days offsetting one day of imprisonment, he should serve one year, four months, and seventeen days, and must pay the fine of two thousand dollars within a specified period. Xu obeyed the order, and the bailiffs immediately took Xu down and sent him to prison for execution.</p>

<p>Sentenced to Twelve Years in Prison</p>
<p>Yao Guisheng, from Shaoxing, 32 years old, worked as a chauffeur for Wu Gaoyou, the owner of Lao Xiang Shi at 234 Guangxi Road. On the morning of the 13th of last month, around 11:00 AM, Yao drove his car number 3836 to the entrance of the Central China Bank on Hankou Road. A dispute arose with Liu Liangmei, the gatekeeper of the bank, over the parking. They fought each other. Liu, being physically weaker, was unable to defeat Yao. In a moment of anger, he took out a gun and fired two shots at Yao, both hitting vital areas. Medical treatment was ineffective, and Yao died. Liu was arrested on the spot by Chinese police officer number 2967 from the General Patrol Room. He was sent to the Criminal Division One of the District Court of the First Special District for interrogation and detention. The details have been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, the hearing continued. First, Wang Yaotang, the police lawyer, explained that the investigation was in progress. The head of the Criminal Division, Qian Hongye, questioned the defendant briefly. As the facts were clear, he immediately announced the verdict in court: Liu Liangmei was sentenced to twelve years in prison. The attached civil lawsuit will be transferred to the Civil Division for trial.</p>
<h3 id="e136">Shanghai Yearbook Published <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>At the end of last year, the Shanghai Municipal Archives, entrusted by the Municipal Government, edited the "Shanghai Yearbook of the Republic of China, 24th Year" The Museum immediately established the Shanghai Yearbook Committee in January of this year, devoting all its efforts to it. According to the original plan, the book would be published at the end of April, and it has now been realized. The entire book contains 1.8 million words, divided into special reports, major event summaries, regional evolution, population, weather, party affairs, administration, judiciary, foreign affairs, military affairs, finance, public boundaries, French Concession, finance, education, transportation, industry, labor, commerce, agriculture, forestry, fisheries and animal husbandry, academics, religion, social undertakings, current events diary, and a list of celebrities (more than 3,700 people). The entire Shanghai has been dissected vertically and horizontally by the yearbook. The entire book has 1,300 pages and a special price of only two yuan.</p>
<p>Liu's Preface: The book features a handwritten inscription by former Mayor Wu and a preface by Liu Yazi, the director of the museum, which states, "In the third year of my tenure as the director of the Shanghai Municipal Archives, the compilation of the Shanghai Yearbook began. Now that the compilation is complete, my colleagues have asked me for a word. I believe that the books of local chronicles in China are abundant, but few authors are capable of writing them well. The best ones are only comparable to historical materials and are mostly half-baked and unrefined. The worst ones are simply cut and paste from outdated newspapers. The Shanghai Municipal Archives is the first organization to study local historical materials using scientific methods and should be listed as a permanent institution. The members of the editorial department work diligently day and night, racking their brains and dedicating themselves to studying Shanghai as a lifelong career. Looking back four thousand years and across ninety thousand miles, there is hardly any comparison. The draft of the general history is expected to be completed in four or five years. The yearbook started this year, and I privately hope that it will be compiled every year without end, so that people all over the world will know why Shanghai is Shanghai and that it will be beneficial to the progress of world culture. If there are enlightened people in the world who do not dismiss these words as irrelevant,</p>
<p>The Compilation Process: From January 1, 1935 (Republic of China 24th Year), most of the members of the Shanghai Yearbook Committee devoted all their efforts to the compilation, extending their working hours from eight hours to ten hours per day. The compilation rules are as follows: 1. This yearbook takes the unified ten tables as the center and is supplemented by text. This is because statistical tables represent the most recent, true, and difficult-to-misrepresent information. Those who are familiar with statistical tables can usually discern whether the numbers or text are correct and genuine. The statistical tables in this yearbook that require comparison will also list the comparison statistics. All statistical tables strive to be for the Republic of China 23rd year (1934). If the enterprise itself does not yet have statistics for the Republic of China 23rd year (1934), then the most recent statistical tables will be used. 2. Each enterprise briefly describes its evolution in order to show the traces of its development. (The information on this evolution is based on the museum's usual research and may be more accurate.) 3. The sources of all materials must be clearly stated to show the basis of the material and to express our gratitude for using the material. 4. The Gregorian calendar dates are mostly attached below the Chinese calendar dates to facilitate calculation. 5. Foreign names and place names are annotated with their original names, except when it is impossible to ascertain their original names, for verification purposes. 6. The writing style uses simple classical Chinese to save space, and new-style punctuation is used for easy reading. What makes us most happy is that the materials requested from all parties have been delivered continuously, either as tables or as files, which are detailed and accurate. The members of the committee then organized them one by one, and those without statistics were compiled by the committee, and those with statistics were repeatedly proofread. The museum originally published a periodical that was completely given away to all sectors of society. However, the costs of typesetting and printing the Shanghai Yearbook are extremely high, and it is sold at a special price, so it will not be given away except to related institutions.</p>

<h3 id="e140">Shen Yunsheng's Heinous Act - Selling His Cousin as a Prostitute <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>Her Chastity Was Violated En Route; the Pimp Couple Awaits Sentencing</p>
<p>A Yang, from Zhangzhou, and his concubine Xu Amao, ran a private brothel at 514 Fujian Road, specializing in colluding with pimps to induce women from good families to secretly sell themselves. Recently, their prostitute Yang Lianhua (19 years old) was not enough to satisfy the customers, so they planned to solicit more beautiful young women to expand their prostitution business. Their fellow villager Shen Yunsheng, who usually did not engage in honest work, only knew how to profit and did not hesitate to commit heinous acts. On March 2nd of this year, Shen falsely told his aunt Yang in his hometown that his cousin A'e, who was 16 years old, should not sit idle at home. He intended to take her to Shanghai to find a factory job. Once she got a job, she would be able to make a profit. Yang was deceived and ordered her daughter A'e to go to Shanghai with Shen's family. During the journey, Shen was lustful and lingered in the area, temporarily staying in a hostel, and the woman's chastity was violated. Shen's funds were not sufficient. After staying in Shuangling for two days, his travel expenses were running out. After satisfying his lust, he continued with his original plan, brought the woman to Shanghai, and discussed the matter with the pimps Xu Axiang and Amao. They agreed to send A'e to the brothel, stipulating that she would work as a prostitute for four months, and Xu would give Shen a deposit of 20 yuan. From then on, the young woman from a good family became a common prostitute. The pimps only wanted to ensure that they had an income every night, so they supervised A'e to welcome new customers and send off old ones, extremely strictly. If there was an empty night, she would be whipped severely. A weak woman who was not fully developed was subjected to this destruction, not only contracting syphilis but also becoming increasingly frail. The woman was trapped in hell, unable to escape. Recently, she met a customer who happened to be from her hometown. She confided in him about the circumstances of her fall, begging for help. The customer was a chivalrous and righteous person and was related to Su Xiao as a fellow villager. He generously agreed to help and immediately sent a letter to A'e's mother, Yang, urging her to come to Shanghai as soon as possible. The other day, Yang arrived in Shanghai, and the customer arranged for the woman to be taken away from the prostitutes and opened a room at the Zhongshan Hotel on Tianjin Road so that the mother and daughter could meet and confide in each other. They determined that the culprit was Shen Yunsheng. They reported the information to the Xinzha Police Station, which sent detective Wu Changkai to investigate the thousand criminals. When they went to arrest Shen, they learned that he had already fled and was missing. Xu Axiang, Xu Amao, who had privately set up a brothel and forced good women into prostitution, and Yang Lianhua, who had been raised as a private prostitute, were arrested and detained separately. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the District Court of the First Special District. Judge Liu Yugui interrogated them. Police lawyer Qian Jiuchen explained the case. The pimps still tried to deny it, but A'e testified about the various circumstances of being forced into prostitution and frequently being abused. Judge Liu then ordered A'e to be sent to a forensic doctor to determine the condition of her venereal disease. Her mother, Yang, was allowed to take her back, and the defendants were still detained to await a scheduled sentencing.</p>

<p>Shanghai Municipal Police Department Director Cai issued a notice yesterday, stating: "It has been reported that recently, there have been incidents of people impersonating personnel from this bureau, entering shops under the guise of searching for drugs, and taking the opportunity to rob. This is extremely hateful. Investigations of criminal suspects should be conducted with an order from a superior officer and in conjunction with the local police officer.

<p>Exempt from Local Donations</p>
<p>The Traffic Committee of the five provinces and cities of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Beijing, and Shanghai believes that bicycles are economical and convenient and are suitable for short-distance travel. They are particularly effective in connecting transportation in the suburbs of cities. Therefore, the committee feels that it is necessary to promote bicycle transportation. Furthermore, because China's connecting highways are developing and the scope of interconnection is expanding, the committee decided at its ninth regular meeting that "vehicles registered and taxed by vehicle owners in their respective provinces and cities shall be allowed to travel in other provinces and cities without being charged additional transit fees or interconnection donations." It also requested the authorities of the five provinces and cities to announce and implement this decision and to separately propose measures to promote bicycles and their manufacturing to facilitate progress. From now on, bicycles within the scope of the five provinces and cities only need to pay the tax and fees in accordance with the regulations in their place of registration once and can travel without obstruction. In addition, the committee stated that the Shanghai China National Road Construction Association will hold a bicycle driving competition on the 12th of this month, which is in line with the committee's aim to promote bicycle transportation. It has specially made nine silver shields with safety shield designs and nine copies of the meeting minutes, which will be awarded to the top three in each group. The Road Association has already displayed them at the China Underwear Company on South Nanjing Road.</p>

<p>Reopening Scheduled Today, Supported by Various Entertainment Groups</p>
<p>Small World, located on Fuyou Road in the city, has been around for many years. However, due to the recent economic downturn, business has been sluggish, and it has been in a state of decline. Recently, the city's Bureau of Education's Drama Review Committee deemed the Siming Opera performances at the venue to be immoral and ordered the entertainment venue to suspend performances for three days. After receiving the order, the venue convened a shareholders' meeting. Due to the poor market conditions and years of losses, the shareholders were not interested in continuing operations and entrusted lawyer Lu Ruizheng to announce the liquidation on the 24th of last month. This affected the livelihoods of more than 1,000 performers and staff members of the entertainment venue, causing panic. They went to the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau to petition for assistance, which yielded very satisfactory results. They then went to the board of directors and lawyer Lu to request assistance in maintaining their livelihoods. Businesses in the vicinity of the entertainment venue have also found it difficult to stay open after Small World closed. It is now reported that the board of directors of the entertainment venue, in order to maintain the livelihoods of the performers and staff, has decided to temporarily reopen during the liquidation period. Representatives from various entertainment groups will work with lawyer Lu and manager Yu Gengsheng to handle all matters. The interior has been completely renovated, and normal operations will resume as of today (the 3rd).</p>

<p>Yesterday (the 2nd) at around 3:00 PM, six ragged Russian men were seen begging for money along Chenjiabo in western Shanghai. They appeared to be drunk and were walking along the road when one of them suddenly fell into a small river behind the Shenxin Old Factory. The other five were not able to swim and did not dare to enter the water to rescue him, resulting in his immediate drowning. Police Chief Li Xizeng of the local police station, after being informed, rushed to the scene and took the five Russians to the Caojiadu Branch Bureau. Bureau official Liu interrogated them, and the five Russians confessed that their names were Jin Xin, Bielu Xin, Guyin Zhuofu, Ruibao Qingfu, and Ge Keguo Sigen (all transliterated). They had all served in a certain military unit in the Northeast and had many scars on their bodies. They were now living in Shanghai, begging for food. The deceased was named Wan Xiula Gegefu, 38 years old, who died after losing his footing and falling into the river due to excessive drinking. After receiving the confession, Bureau official Liu immediately ordered the local保甲 to report to the local court for an examination. He also sent a message to transfer the five Russians to the Public Security Bureau for interrogation.</p>

<h3 id="e147">Zhu Xuefan: Labor Day Speech <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>Expanding Literacy Education, Indicating the Path of Struggle for Workers</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Labor Union commemorated May Day by holding a memorial meeting. Chairman Zhu Xuefan also delivered a speech at the Central and Western Radio Station at 4:00 PM, outlining the path of struggle for workers and promoting labor literacy education. His words were very encouraging. The transcript of his speech is as follows: Fellow compatriots, comrades, all workers in Shanghai, all workers in the country, today is May 1st, International Labor Day, commemorating the successful "Sanba" (three eights) movement launched by American workers in 1886. Fifty years ago, American workers suffered greatly under the oppression of capitalists. Unable to bear the oppression and destruction of capitalists, they launched the Labor Day movement in 1886, demanding the "Sanba" system. The American workers were indeed victorious. From May 1st of that year, the "Sanba" system of eight hours of work, eight hours of education, and eight hours of rest was implemented. We must know that in the year before the demand for the "Sanba" system, in 1885, several workers who led the movement in Chicago were sentenced to death by the government. At the time of their execution, they shouted loudly and fearlessly, "The time will come when our silence in the grave will be more moving than our speeches." We believe that they sacrificed their blood and heads for the welfare of workers and for the happiness of the masses. When they were executed, they were still so brave and righteous. This spirit of regarding death as returning home is really worthy of admiration and emulation. Today, the "Sanba" system can be implemented in most countries in the world, which is the result of their efforts. Laborers all over the world commemorate the sacrificed martyrs and commemorate the success of the "Sanba" system, which is the commemoration of this May Day. We in China only had this memorial day and the memorial ceremony in the seventh year of the Republic of China. Our President Sun was one of the most enthusiastic advocates of May Day. President Sun worked hard to find a way out for the workers, to seek welfare for the workers, to relieve the suffering and oppression of the workers, and to save the laborers of all of China. Therefore, he worked hard to promote May Day, worked hard to shout for the "Sanba" system, and launched the workers' movement. Therefore, the Chinese workers' movement relied on this seed to develop and grow to this day. We all know that the Chinese workers' movement is most historical, glorious, and great in Shanghai. However, it has now turned into a period of decline. We know that the workers' movement in Shanghai only started after the May Fourth Movement in the eighth year of the Republic of China. That period can be regarded as the first stage, which can be called the germination period. The workers' organization and training, the spirit and strength of struggle, are gradually developing. After the May 30th Massacre in the fourteenth year of the Republic of China, it entered the first stage, which we can call the enlightenment period. In order to resist the oppression of imperialism and the exploitation of capitalists, workers spontaneously organized and used a firm spirit, selfless long struggles, and sacrifices to create the foundation of the workers' movement. After the National Revolutionary Army arrived in Shanghai in the sixteenth year of the Republic of China, the workers' movement entered the third stage, which can be regarded as the golden period. The workers' organization and training, the workers' strength and spirit, were fully expressed, which released a brilliant flower in the history of the labor movement in Shanghai and became a great enemy of imperialist capitalists. If we can carry on this spirit, the future development will be increasingly expanded. However, since the "September 18th Incident" in the twentieth year of the Republic of China and the "January 28th Incident" in the twenty-first year, the workers' movement has declined, the welfare of the workers has rarely developed, and the power of the workers has declined day by day. The labor movement in Shanghai is also like the setting sun on the Western Hills, declining and depressed. This is roughly the process of the labor movement in Shanghai, which can also be said to be the history of the development of the labor movement in the whole of China. What is the workers' movement in the whole of China now? What is the workers' movement in Shanghai now? Declining, the same decline. We see that the workers in Shanghai are now implementing the "Sanba" system, are they living a stable life? We know that not only has the "Sanba" system not been implemented, but no one hires them even if they are willing to work twelve hours a day, and no one pays attention to them even if they are willing to do heavy work for the lowest wages. As for a stable life, that is even more out of the question. What is the reason for this? We know that our country is suffering from the oppression and aggression of imperialist economy, the rural economy is bankrupt, industry and commerce are declining, there is a huge amount of unfavorable balance of trade, and silver is flowing out, resulting in the current economic crisis. Therefore, factories are closing down and workers are unemployed. The entire nation and the entire country are trapped in a critical period. It is really difficult to solve the labor problem alone. Therefore, the workers' movement has declined, and the workers have silently and quietly laid down. We see that the Second Factory and the Fifth Factory of the Shenxin Textile Company, which is known as our national industry, have not yet started work, and the Seventh Factory has not yet been resolved after being unreasonably auctioned off by HSBC. The oppression of the imperialist economy has damaged our national industry. Even large factories like Shenxin cannot withstand it. Other small capital factories and shops are naturally unable to save it. We see that many factories and shops are either closing down automatically or being sealed by the court. This phenomenon really makes us feel sad. The entire market situation in China is now like this. How can the workers in Shanghai and the workers in the whole country implement the "Sanba" system? In reality, it cannot be discussed in China at present. China's unfavorable balance of trade from the eighth year of Tongzhi to the twenty-third year of the Republic of China totaled 1,090,591,000 流 out. We think that in the past 66 years, there has been such a large number, which is really appalling. China has such a vast land, such abundant products, such a large population, and such a profound culture, but it just keeps sending money to foreign countries day by day and cannot think of a way to collect it back. It has been reduced to this disabled scene. Can we not be pessimistic? But pessimism is useless. We must recognize the most important reason for the current situation. We must make fundamental remedies from this reason. What is the biggest reason for the Chinese crisis? That is, illiteracy and lack of education. (To be continued)</p>
<h3 id="e148">Art Exhibition: Preview on the 24th and 25th <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>May 1st was the 24th day of the Shanghai preview of the London International Exhibition of Chinese Art and also International Labor Day. Many agencies and factories were closed, so many people visited the exhibition. The exhibition is scheduled to close on the 5th, as it is also the anniversary of the President's inauguration. However, there will be no further extension. The news obtained on that day is summarized below:</p>
<p>Song's Visit: Song Ziwen, Standing Committee Member of the National Economic Council, arrived at the exhibition at 9:00 AM and visited with his staff. He browsed through the exhibits and carefully appreciated them. He frequently praised the exquisite pieces. He left the exhibition at about 10:00 AM.</p>
<p>Another Opinion: I visited the London Art Exhibition preview once last week. On April 30th, because I got a group discount, I asked to see it again. As soon as I entered the door, I went to the throne room, where it was crowded with people. The throne was surrounded, and some people were standing on tiptoe to look over the heads of others, and some were bending over to look through the gaps in the crowd. It was so uncomfortable to see it. Fortunately, I had seen it once, and I had seen the Forbidden City and the Three Great Halls in Beiping, so it didn't matter if I went to other showrooms first. Therefore, I felt that an old chair that was sat on by an emperor who had been overthrown in the country and was about to disappear in the world, why does it have such a great magic power that can still make people admire it? Then again, the rarer the thing, the more special it is. If everyone is an emperor and every family has a treasure house, then is it worth displaying the exhibition for the price of two oceans of tickets? Thinking about it, I unconsciously entered the calligraphy and painting room. My view this time was different from the previous one. I chose to pay special attention to what I subjectively thought was good, and I just glanced at what I didn't like. In fact, aren't these people who look at the flowers the same way? Because I like Chinese calligraphy and painting, I finished seeing all the other showrooms and turned to the Tang, Song, and Yuan calligraphy and painting room again. The "Peddler's Picture" written by Su Hanchen, a Song person, is indeed a famous painting, but in the dazzling jungle of calligraphy and paintings, it is really impossible to distinguish its special and extraordinary features. A silent man with a scholarly attitude stood in front of this "Peddler's Picture" and stared intently, as if thinking about something. He nodded and shook his head from time to time, standing there for a long time, as if he wanted to buy the goods of the peddler. A receptionist wearing a membership badge smiled and asked, "Does Your Excellency have an interest in this painting?" The man pointed and said, "Look at the gloves on this. We usually think that gloves are imported goods and were invented by foreigners. But from this painting, we can prove that our ancestors knew how to use gloves as early as a thousand years ago, when they had not yet traded with Europe. This is a gratifying thing." Then he said, "The things sold by this peddler, axes, saws, knives, rulers, willow weaving, tools, farm tools, various utensils, and various toys, are almost the same as they are now. That is, this cart for selling goods can be seen everywhere in small cities, which is enough to prove that our social situation and material civilization have not made much progress for thousands of years. How can we catch up with the trend of the world? Alas, everyone, hurry up and work hard." I remember that the old man who published his notes on the newspaper a few days ago boasted that he could taste the taste outside the taste. I think this scholar can observe the social evolution problem from the art with his calm mind and keen eyes. Searching for the taste outside the taste, the old man can't be unique in front of me. (An opinion from a visitor)</p>
<p>Only Three Days Left: Yesterday (the 2nd) was the 25th day of the Shanghai preview of the London International Exhibition of Chinese Art. According to the person in charge of the exhibition yesterday, the antiques will be shipped to England soon. The extension of this preview was entirely in response to requests from all walks of life. There will be no further extension in order to avoid affecting the date of the antiques being shipped to England. There are only three days left for the preview. After three days, it will be closed.</p>

<p>The lease of the Star Film Company's Xibushi Road factory has expired, and the company is eager to find a good place to relocate. After many searches, it was decided to relocate to the bank of Fenglin Bridge on Xuxu Road. In the past half month, the props and other items have been loaded and transported one after another, and most of them have been moved. The grand opening ceremony of the new factory was held at 4:00 PM on the day before yesterday (May 1st). More than 300 staff members and actors of the company gathered at the old site of the company, took cars, and went to the new company in an orderly manner. The sound of firecrackers was deafening for a while. The colleagues entered the auditorium, held the housewarming ceremony, then served refreshments, and dispersed happily. The new factory covers an area of ​​30 acres and has three large bungalows, which is three times larger than the original site on Xibushi Road. The location is close to Longhua, the air is fresh, facing the small river, and the green shade is like a canopy, making it a good environment for making films. It is reported that during the transition period of the company's relocation, it will temporarily rent the Yucheng Company's photography studio to produce new films.

<p>Wenzhou Baihao Condensed Milk has been well-received by people across the country since its introduction to the market. This is because its production method is excellent, and the materials are pure, far surpassing imported goods. Monthly sales have reached thousands of cases. To expand its business, the factory has specially appointed Shanghai's well-reputed Jihua Tang Pharmacy as the national general manager to facilitate expansion and prevent leakage. The price is extremely cheap, with large tins priced at five dimes and small tins at one dime and three cents. Department stores, pharmacies, and other food stores across the country all sell it.</p>

<p>The Jue Lu Ballroom Newly Installed with Air Conditioning After Mr. Zhang Zhiqing took over the Jue Lu Ballroom, he hired experts to design and decorate it, so the interior has been completely renovated and is vastly different from the past. Although it has not been open for long, dance enthusiasts have been extraordinarily crowded every day. The ballroom is centrally located, the dancers are excellent, the music is clear and melodious, and the service is attentive, so it is no wonder that people from all walks of life flock to it. It is now reported that Mr. Zhang, in view of the increasingly hot weather in recent days and for the comfort of the dancers, has spared no expense to install the latest type of air conditioning system. It is currently being installed day and night and should be completed soon.</p>
<p>Longhu Rendan Selling Well In recent years, imports of foreign goods have been excessive. Patriotic people have taken measures to promote domestic goods. Domestic industries have also devoted themselves to research on their products. The Longhu Rendan produced by the Sino-French Pharmacy, with its excellent materials, has long been trusted by all sectors of society. Recently, with the weather getting hotter, sales of this medicine have increased sharply. Various institutions and groups are purchasing it in bulk for distribution as gifts. The Military Medical Department of the Ministry of National Defense recently ordered fifty large boxes. It is said that this is the first batch purchased by the city, and more will be purchased in large quantities in the future to meet the needs of the military. As a result, the pharmaceutical factory on Daxilu Road is adding workers and working day and night to produce it, which shows how popular this domestic product is.</p>
<p>Ma-Style Comedian Snake King Kun Performs in Mingzhu Since its opening, the Pengzhu Grand Theatre on Lao Baizi Road and Fusheng Road has been striving for improvement in all aspects. Recently, at great expense, it hired the famous Cantonese opera Ma-style comedian Snake King Kun from Guangdong to perform in Shanghai. The Ma style refers to the Ma Shizeng style, and Snake King Kun's skills are actually superior to Ma Shizeng's. Every time he appears on stage, he makes the audience burst into laughter. Snake King Kun's humor is not only apparent on the surface, but his underlying humor is even more thought-provoking. Since Cantonese opera was introduced to Shanghai, such a figure has never been seen. Coupled with the collaboration of the famous actress Guan Yinglian, it is even more perfect and difficult to match, so the theater has been sold out every day.</p>

<p>This year's Shanghai Open Doubles Handball Championship has been transferred from Zhu Jue and Hong Yukui last year to Clarke and Bowes. The two groups fought at the Xiqing Club at 6:30 PM on the 1st. The performance of all four was very impressive, and Zhu Kuan was particularly outstanding. Their final defeat was due to the lack of endurance of his assistant, Hong Yukui, who had difficulty coping. Clarke's right hand and Bowes' left hand each showed superb skills, and they also focused on Hong's weaknesses, so they got their wish and won the doubles championship. In the first game, Zhu and Hong won easily with 21 to 13. The second and third games both failed at 19 points. The results of the two games were both 19 to 21, which is extremely regrettable.</p>

East Asia has been working hard to improve its skills before the school is more advanced. Jinan has veteran volleyball players Kuang Yiyao and Yuan Zeqian, so the situation was very tense when the two sides fought. At the beginning of the first game, East Asia's front row used quick spikes, and Jinan could not resist, losing six points in a row. After that, Ma Nan cheered up and tried to stay calm, and also used fierce spikes to pressure East Asia. Fortunately, East Asia's defense was tight and lost few points. In the first game, East Asia won 21 to 14. In the second game, the competition between the two sides became more intense, with many highlights. Xie Yongyuan of East Asia assisted in the killing effectively, Tian Chun's penalty shot was like a bullet, and Lin Zhenxin in the second row was steady and stable in the center. Although Jinan made repeated efforts, it was unable to achieve its wish. As a result, East Asia won again 21 to 12. In the third game, Jinan was unwilling to show weakness, and Kuang Yiyao and Li Jianxin scored one after another. East Asia also relied on effective communication, and the situation became balanced, first 6 to 6 and then 9 to 9. East Asia changed sides with 11 to 2. In the rematch, Jinan made a surprise attack, and it was done in one go, and it had the potential to drive East Asia up. However, everyone in East Asia was called a connection, and the performance was refined, and Jinan was determined not to succeed. The final result was 3 to 0, and East Asia won completely. After the game, East Asia entertained tea and snacks, and the guests and hosts dispersed after three cheers.

<p>Shen Junji, Lin Junkanghou, Wu Junyunzhai, and other directors of the Shanghai Municipal Popular Education Promotion Association, gathered last year to persuade less funding and establish rural elementary schools in many places, to establish a foundation for genuine education and rural relief. After the resolution, they immediately proceeded with strength. The three directors, Lin Wu and Shen, sent letters to Liu Junhuizhi, Fu Junxiaoan, Li Junfusheng, Chen Junduo, Zhu Junzikui, Chen Junzheqing, Ye Junfuxiao, Hu Junbijiang, Chen Junzixin, Pei Junzhenyong, Yu Junzuoting, Xu Junboming, and other giants in Shanghai's banking industry for their strong support. After the decision, they immediately proceeded with strength. The three directors, Lin Wu and Shen, sent letters to Liu Junhuizhi, Fu Junxiaoan, Li Junfusheng, Chen Junduo, Zhu Junzikui, Chen Junzheqing, Ye Junfuxiao, Hu Junbijiang, Chen Junzixin, Pei Junzhenyong, Yu Junzuoting, Xu Junboming, and other giants in Shanghai's banking industry for their strong support. They allocated funds for trial operation. Shen Jun also persuaded Feng Junyixiang, Cai Junjinxiang, Ji Junhaiquan, Du Junyunchu, Chen Junyunting, and doctor Lu Juntingshi, and other giants in Pudong's industrial and commercial circles to agree to designate school cooperation, prepare school equipment, and contribute to annual operating expenses. With the arrangements in order, Shen Jun personally visited the two county heads of Chuansha and Nanhui and the two education leaders, and reported the establishment of the five schools. They all sent personnel to investigate and guide, and subsidized the expenses as appropriate. As a result, Xingdong Elementary School was established in Jijiandangtou near the seadyke, Siwei Elementary School was established in Caijia Village, and Zhirenyong Elementary School was established in Wangyima Bridge near Xinlu South. The above three schools are all within the Chuansha County boundary. Sanyu Elementary School was established in Chenqiao Village, and Zhengmeng Elementary School was established in Longwangmiao Town. The above two schools are all within the Nanhui County boundary. The school buildings and school equipment required by each school were all donated by the directors of the Pudong schools. In the autumn of last year, they began to repair the houses, convert the glass doors and windows, and pave the playground. All were bright and clean, and completely new. With the cooperation of the gentlemen of the China Vocational Education Society, qualified teachers were selected and hired. At the end of January of the 24th year of the Republic of China, all five schools started classes. After three months of reviewing the results, they are still considerable. Mr. Shen believes that the cause of rural improvement must also be carried out gradually. Hongqiao Temple is very popular every year on the 28th day of the third month of the lunar calendar, and there is also a large market for agricultural tools and furniture. Tens of thousands of farmers and women and children go to Hongqiao. Mr. Shen ordered to gather teachers and students from various schools in a house in Hongqiao on that day to hold a lecture meeting and display the academic achievements of the five schools. The meeting was held at 1:00 PM. Thousands of guests, teachers, and students were recorded. First, Mr. Shen Jiyi lectured on the importance of rural education, the reforms that should be made to bad customs, etc., and the general meaning of the Eight Virtues Song of Filial Piety, Brotherly Love, Loyalty, Faith, Propriety, Justice, Integrity, and Shame. Then the teachers distributed the printed materials of the Eight Virtues Song widely. Mr. Shen also showed several new patterns of improved native cloth to the public, urging rural women not to abandon the textile industry, and said that officials are now advocating the use of native cloth, not foreign cloth. All teachers and students must wear native cloth, which saves money and is durable, and money will not flow out. The people of the Popular Education Association are trying to promote native cloth and are trying to promote the sale of native cloth, etc. Next, Mr. Ni Zijia, a teacher at Zhengmeng Elementary School, lectured on the need for rural areas to repair roads and dredge rivers and banks, etc., and the need for people to have a sense of public interest. Next, Mr. Shen Xiazun, a teacher at Xingdong Elementary School, spoke about eliminating superstitions and improving cotton planting and improving the planting of green beans. Then, Mr. Fu Xixing, a teacher at Zhirenyong Elementary School, Mr. Qian Mingqiang, a teacher at Siwei Elementary School, and Mr. Yang Shilin, a teacher at Sanyu Elementary School, either talked about hygiene, or about public morality, or about the way to build a family through diligence and thrift, or about the principle that doing good is the greatest happiness, or about the harm of not being literate. The audience praised them a lot. On this day, Mr. Shen prepared Chinese food and invited the teachers to lunch, and prepared more tea and snacks to entertain the students who attended the meeting.</p>

<p>Jiangxi Senior Vocational School in this port has its own school site of sixteen mu, with more than seventy school buildings. The school property has always been rich, but all equipment costs have increased year by year due to the progress of school affairs, and the factory dormitory needs to be expanded urgently. Xu Suzhong, the principal of the school, went to Nanchang in person a month ago to request Chairman Xiong and Director Cheng of the Education Department of the Jiangxi Provincial Government to subsidize the annual operating expenses of 20,000 yuan to help development. Xu has now returned to Shanghai after completing his official duties yesterday. It is heard that Chairman Xiong has approved his request and will subsidize 20,000 yuan annually starting from the 24th year. Jiangxi's finances have been very difficult due to years of banditry, and Chairman Xiong is still willing to provide special subsidies for private schools outside the province, which shows his enthusiasm for education. According to Xu, education in Jiangxi has made great progress in recent years, and the education expenditure for the next year will be increased to 2.5 million yuan.</p>

<p>The cause and effect of gain and loss: With money, you have women; with women, you have love. When love is lost, women run away, and the money bag is empty.</p>
<p>Snobbishness oppresses people: Snobbish people are cultivated by people without snobbishness. People without snobbishness are oppressed by people with snobbishness, and they are willing to do so. Don't you hear such boring words: "It is an honor to be slapped by ××!"</p>
<h3 id="e186">Love and Bread <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>— Hu Tianyu</p>
<p>Love is the wave of life. Where there is life, there is love, just like where there is the sea, there are waves. Bread is the sustenance of life. Where there is life, there must be bread, just like fish need water.</p>
<p>Love is spiritual food, while bread is material nourishment.</p>
<p>People cannot lose material nourishment, just as fish cannot live without water. Fish leave the water and can lose their lives in an instant; people lose material nourishment and can turn a strong body into steamed buns in an instant.</p>
<p>But sometimes people may as well lose spiritual food, just as the sea may as well be calm sometimes. The sea has no waves, although it loses its activity and its greatness, it is still the sea; people have no spiritual food, although they feel dull and boring, they are still human beings.</p>
<p>Therefore, life may as well be without love, but it cannot be without bread!</p>
<p>What's more, love is often built on bread. Without bread, you can't even protect your life, let alone love. Let us sing the popular song now: "Hurry up and throw it away, knead the fresh flowers, throw away the fresh flowers, close the heart flowers, collect the flowers of love, forget him, don't think about him, unlock the locks and shackles!" It can be seen that love is just to sell the shackles, it is not as tasty as bread.</p>
<p>What the masses need now is not love, but bread!</p>
<h3 id="e187">Ghost Cry <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>— Chonglou</p>
<p>I am not a scientist, but I still have a non-superstitious mind. I don't believe in "ghosts" because I have never seen a ghost.</p>
<p>But recently I have often heard a kind of terrible sound—like the ghost cry described by people who talk about "ghosts"! This sound comes from police cars and ambulances. Sometimes it suddenly vibrates in the air, passes by the windows along the road, and pierces my eardrums very loudly.</p>
<p>It is said that this is a special device on the police car that can make pedestrians avoid it when they hear it; perhaps it is precisely because its sound is too peculiar that I named it "ghost cry".</p>
<p>How is this not a "ghost cry"? When you hear that sound, you will know that a theft has occurred, and you will immediately think of the scene of catching thieves, fighting, and many deaths and injuries; or a car accident has occurred, and you will immediately think of the tragic scene of pedestrians being crushed under the wheels, with broken feet and legs, and blood flowing from the brain; although you only hear the terrible sound, it is as if you witnessed the terrible everything.</p>
<p>The city is a place of murder, and this "ghost cry" is just a report, no matter which aspect the report belongs to.</p>
<p>I wonder what people living in the city think about this increasing "ghost cry" sound?</p>

<p>— By Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 12: Ashamed of Having No Clothes, I Hang Curtains to Avoid Guests; Industrious in Saving Lamp Oil, I Copy Before Dawn</p>
<p>Zhou Yourong said, "The classrooms are all so simple. Of course, other facilities are out of the question." Zhiqian shook his head and said, "Speaking of this, one can truly shed tears for the people of the Northwest. They lack all the tools for studying, to put it simply. How can we talk about any equipment? An hour after my conversation with the principal, that teacher went to the classroom to teach arithmetic. He spent a lot of effort explaining things like how many catties and taels are in a ton, copying it on the blackboard. The students were even busier. Because they didn't have books, everyone was copying from their notebooks. Since the students had to listen to the lecture and also copy the book, they couldn't manage it. Therefore, they had to wait until after the lecture before starting to copy. While the students were copying, the teacher would stop lecturing. In the end, the teacher finished lecturing and dismissed the class. The students, because it was getting late, didn't have time to finish copying, so they closed the classroom, in order to preserve the chalk writing on the blackboard and copy it again tomorrow, so it wouldn't be rubbed off. At that time, I also said goodbye and left, arranging to talk again tomorrow. But my curiosity was strong, so the next day I got up very early and went to see them when their first class started, in order to confirm whether they were attending class on time. Fortunately, there was no gatekeeper there, so as long as the main gate was open, I could enter without hesitation. The people of the Northwest are very good at getting up early, so even though I got up very early to go, they had already opened the gate." (195)</p>
<h3 id="e190">Rectification of Peculiar Surnames <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Hua</p>
<p>The special issue on peculiar surnames in this column on the 27th can be described as diverse and spectacular. However, it seems inappropriate to include the surnames of the Peking opera circle among the peculiar ones in Mr. Yijiao's discussion. This is because, in the Qing Dynasty, Manchus all used their given names as surnames, almost to the point of one person, one surname. If we consider them strange, we couldn't record them all. (For example, Puyi used Pu as his surname, the previous generation used Zai, (Zai Zhen) used Zai as his surname, and the generation before that used Yi, (Yikuang) used Yi as his surname.) After the change of dynasty, many adopted Han surnames. As for Shi Huibao, Gong Dayuan, En Xiaofeng, Rui Debao, De Junru, Ci Ruiquan, Ru Fuhui, etc., I know that they are all Manchus.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Ru Fuhui sings Xiaomian (a type of comedic role), not Qingyi (a leading female role), and together with his brother Fu Lan, who studies Wusheng (male martial role), they both came from the Fu Liancheng opera school and are the sons of the famous Qin player Ru Laiqing, also from a family of performers.</p>

<p>— Originally written by Princess Der Ling of the Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>In terms of consumer value and use, socks are of course a smaller item than phoenix shoes, and no matter how meticulous one is, one cannot find any patterns to be meticulous about on socks. Therefore, the palace had not established a separate sock-making industry but instead let the shoemakers take charge of it concurrently. Even so, the Empress Dowager paid special attention to her own socks and was very picky. She had to change into a new pair of socks every day, and after taking them off, she would never use them again. In her eyes, a pair of socks was really worthless, like a thread! But in all conscience, her socks were indeed valuable! Their raw material was the finest pure white soft silk, and the workmanship was even more exquisite, making them so suitable for Her Old Majesty's honorable feet that they were almost perfectly fitted everywhere. Even the silk stockings we wear now would not easily achieve such results, let alone things made by human hands at that time?</p>
<p>Each sock must have two seams, one in the front and one in the back. This is because socks made of soft silk are not as elastic as modern thread or silk socks, so these two seams must be opened on the sock leg; otherwise, how would people's feet fit in? However, from an aesthetic point of view, these two seams cannot be considered a major defect. The Empress Dowager, who loved beauty the most, would of course try her best to remedy this defect. So, those skilled needleworkers came up with an excellent solution for her: they used silk threads of various colors to tie special patterns around the two seams, thus hiding the two seams and making them look like part of the pattern.

<h3 id="e192">Vegetable Rice <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>— Tian Sheweng</p>
<p>It's lunchtime: small restaurants on the street are cooking fragrant "vegetable rice" in woks. White, pearl-like rice, fresh green vegetables, stir-fried with lard – this is called "vegetable rice."</p>
<p>A plate of spare ribs, a bowl of egg flower soup, eaten with vegetable rice: this is called "spare rib vegetable rice." Two large pieces of meat, a bowl of pickled vegetable soup, eaten with vegetable rice: this is called "four-joy vegetable rice." There's also shredded pork fried rice, shrimp fried rice, gizzard and liver fried rice, large meat noodles, eel noodles, shredded pork fried rice cake, wontons... small restaurants have everything to offer for friends from writing offices to choose from.</p>
<p>Wontons and meat noodles are "snacks" and are not filling enough, so they are often eaten as lunch. Eating at restaurants every day is beyond the means of most writing office friends. Considering the price is cheap and it fills you up, "vegetable rice" is the thing to have.</p>
<p>Most writing office friends don't have room and board provided. Garret rooms and lofts are their residences; eating becomes a problem. Due to economic reasons, they have to have a special relationship with "vegetable rice."</p>
<p>When it's lunchtime, one person after another comes from writing offices to vegetable rice restaurants – this is the reason.</p>
<p>The ancients said: "With full vegetable rice, even coarse clothes feel soft." Friends who eat writing office meals, in principle, absolutely cannot wear coarse clothes; at the very least, they must have one or two sets of Western suits. As for whether this kind of "vegetable rice" is filling or not, that's another question!</p>

<h3 id="e193">Beheading <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>— Zhen Lu</p>
<p>But hearing the locals curse people with "kill your skull," and the notoriously shrewd Ningbo people curse with "chop your head off," and most other people also use beheading as a curse, it can be seen that almost everyone with a head dislikes beheading and would rarely be fooled by Jin Shengtan's wild statement that "beheading is the most enjoyable thing in the world."</p>
<p>I have thought that the ancients established the crime of beheading probably to exert the effect of eliminating life; but regardless of which part of the human body the perpetrator of the crime or trouble belongs to, all the blame is attributed to a head and it is made to bear the burden of compensation. Isn't it too unfair to single out the head for such treatment?</p>
<p>In the past, the executioners who carried out the beheading of criminals in our country could not be employed unless they were skilled in the art of killing, so the job of beheading was regarded as a profession, and some were hereditary. Since the Republic of China, these executioners have become unemployed. Even if the warlords of a certain period could not bear the true talent to be lost and the national art to decline, and intended to promote them, I am afraid there would also be sighs of talent being difficult to find.</p>
<p>In the past, after the supervising executioner carried out the execution, he would definitely go to the City God Temple to burn incense, called "shedding the shadow." After returning to the yamen, he would have to ascend to the official seat, and a group of runners and yamen servants would hold sticks and boards and shout to drive him in and out, called "arranging the yamen." The intention was to fear that the head was killed unjustly, or that the vengeful spirit would not dissipate and would immediately chase after the supervising executioner to harass him for his life, so it was necessary to trouble a colleague—the City God, who was the underworld authority—to lock up or drive away that uninteresting vengeful spirit. After killing his head, they were still afraid that his soul would be wronged and seek revenge. This kind of imposing but timid superstition could only be done by the officials of the past.</p>
<p>Nowadays, countries with a civilized appearance like to promote humanitarianism, legislating to retain the death penalty but abolish beheading, and even extend compassion to the remains, even stipulating the crime of damaging corpses, which is truly the extreme of compassion! But alas, the world is still chaotic, and the authorities also believe that severe laws must be used to govern unruly people, so the farce of beheading is again being publicly staged in what is considered an extraordinary state—recently, Russia even borrowed talent from abroad, inviting a Mr. Li from our country to replace a previous executioner who went insane and was suspended from duty. Germany also had two female spies and a romantic woman recently sentenced to beheading by the government, showing the trend of the revival of beheading in the world—those regarded as unruly people unexpectedly get to enjoy the taste of beheading, and people with a lust for killing also get to enjoy this unexpected spectacle in the 20th century.</p>
<p>Before the establishment of the National Government, I once visited Suzhou and was sitting in a rickshaw passing through a certain city gate when I inadvertently looked up and saw two lifelike human heads hanging high on top of the city gate. I was both surprised and disgusted, and had an indescribable feeling that surpassed the rare curiosity. I really didn't want to look at it any more, but my body had to pass under those two heads to enter the city. Since then, whenever I hear or see the word "beheading," the impression of those two heads on the Suzhou city gate inevitably resurfaces in my mind. I want to thank the official who presided over the killing and ordering for giving me such a deep and indelible impression, even though I have no luck to witness the spectacle of beheading! Amen!</p>

<h3 id="e194">Finance Yesterday, the Market's Gold Standard Supplemented Short Positions Fiercely, Rising by Twenty-Nine Yuan Seven Cents <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>Printing Silver Frequently Contracted, Foreign Exchange Was Extremely Tight, the Future Market Reached 800 Yuan</p>
<p>The Day Before, the Cantonese Syndicate Supplemented Short Positions, and the Exchange Market Was Average, Only at One Yuan</p>
<p>Since the Cantonese Syndicate's short covering the day before, the chips have become narrower, and people are eagerly optimistic. The Jewish merchant Qiao Zhifu secretly covered his short positions very fiercely. The frequent decline in printed silver and the extremely tight foreign exchange market contributed greatly to buying sentiment, rebounding to the 800-yuan mark. In the early morning, due to the decline in overseas silver markets and the reduction in the Montevideo forward silver price by 2.15 to 2.7 cents, and a slight increase in foreign exchange rates, the rise in London raw gold by 4 pence, people were in a cheerful mood. The over-the-counter pre-market trading opened, immediately rising to 74.5 yuan. The chips were even scarcer, rising again to 78.9 yuan. The Central Bank's official exchange rates were announced, with English and American currencies remaining flat. The customs gold unit rose by 3 cents, and the gold standard price rose to 829 yuan. The market opened with a high price, remaining normal after the opening, hovering around 80 yuan. HSBC's official English and American exchange rates remained flat. In addition, the Central Bank and Sassoon continued to hold shillings, leading to a period of weakness. However, with people tending towards optimism and the market being exhausted, it was easy to pull up. Chinese merchants vigorously bought foreign exchange, contributing greatly to buying sentiment, gradually rising. Reuters reported that speculators believed the U.S. government's delay in purchasing silver was extremely unfavorable to speculators and that multiple opinions, such as raising the silver price to $1.29, seemed to indicate a need to reduce the silver coin fineness. This stirred people's hearts. The Cantonese and Dalian syndicates bought up U.S. dollars, gradually breaking through 90 yuan. There were also rumors that the Jewish merchant Qiao Zhifu was buying up U.S. dollars. The foreign exchange market became even tighter, and buying sentiment was even stronger, once rising to 798 yuan. Sassoon and the banks seized the opportunity to sell at high prices, leading to a reversal in the afternoon, but the market remained firm after the close. The future market was boosted by the report of a reduction in printed silver by 26 annas, fueling buying and rising again after opening. However, because the banks fiercely sold at high prices and engaged in hedging activities, the market tended to decline, but did not break the 90-yuan mark. There was continued support at the low price, and the market gradually stabilized after the low. Later, the silver price fell again by 10 annas for the second time, leading to another rebound. Although there were fluctuations after that, there was no apparent oversupply in the market due to Qiao Zhifu's aggressive covering of short positions, and the market once rose to 800 yuan. HSBC dumped shillings, and many people took profits after the high price. Although the market was firm in the end, there was much fluctuation. The day's market was initially flat but then bullish, and the market sentiment was particularly prosperous. The swap price retreated to over 7 yuan yesterday due to the current spot market relationship. Now, the day's market conditions are recorded below:</p>

<h3 id="e195">Silver Price Decline, Exchange Market Tightens <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>Central Bank of China and HSBC All Strive to Manage, but There is Talk of George Chu Secretly Making Aggressive Covering Purchases</p>
<p>According to foreign dispatches yesterday, the London spot and forward rates both narrowed to 18.75. It was said that the closing price was 1.15 lower than the listed price. The New York silver price contracted by 0.75. The forward silver price in Monterrey fell by varying amounts from 0.15 to 0.27 cents. The London price of raw gold rose by four pence. The British pound against the US dollar rose by 0.375, the US dollar against the British pound rose by 0.25, the British pound against the French franc rose by 22 points, and the US dollar against the French franc fell by 0.015. The exchange market opened in the morning with near-term selling prices of 1 shilling, 8 pence, 0.5625, and 0.625 in tandem. The US dollar exchange rate was 41.4375 yuan. Compared to the previous close, the British pound was tighter by 0.03125, and the US dollar was tighter by 0.00625. After the opening, sentiment turned bullish. The Central Bank of China's posted exchange rates were announced, with both British and American rates remaining unchanged. The customs gold unit rose by 0.03 yuan, but the process had already tightened. Banks made slight covering purchases, but because the Central Bank, Sassoon, and China Bank were taking advantage of high prices to sell, anticipating that HSBC would post unchanged British and American rates, Chinese merchants became more confident. As a result, the exchange market showed a sign of demand exceeding supply. Reuters reported that the US government was easing its silver policy, which was unfavorable to speculators. Sentiment suddenly turned bullish, and the process gradually tightened. Some Chinese merchants, such as those from the Guangdong and Dalian regions, made covering purchases, causing the market to tighten to a certain extent. However, because banks like Sassoon were still taking advantage of the high prices to sell, the process gradually hardened. The future market tightened as soon as the Indian silver report showed a contraction of 0.26 anna. Banks took advantage of the high prices to sell, gradually becoming rigid. However, sentiment remained good. Indian silver contracted another 0.1 anna. Rumors circulated that George Chu was secretly making aggressive covering purchases. As a result, although HSBC made a large supply available, the daily absorption was insufficient, and the process gradually tightened. The closing near-term selling prices were 1 shilling, 8 pence, 0.125 for the British pound and 40.375 yuan for the US dollar. Compared to the previous close, the British pound was tighter by 0.005 pence, and the US dollar was tighter by 1.125 yuan. Chinese merchants made covering purchases of approximately 200,000 pounds sterling and over 700,000 yuan in US dollars. HSBC aggressively sold over 400,000 pounds sterling.

<h3 id="e197">Securities: Ministry of Finance Issues Order That 96 Old Bonds Can Also Be Delivered Starting This Month <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>Market Atmosphere Unusually Volatile, Sudden Small Rise of 0.7-0.8 Yuan in Two Days, Transaction Volume Accounts for More Than Half</p>
<p>In the past two days, the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange was completely in an unusually volatile state with the 96 bonds. People were anxious and excited. After the joint meeting on May 3, 1929, decided that the delivery of 96 public bonds would be limited to new bonds, the price of old bonds was only around 4 yuan. Recently, the Ministry of Finance suddenly notified the supervisors and informed the exchange that, starting from May 1, old and new bonds would be universally valid, with the same treatment, and allowed for futures delivery starting in May, treating them equally. A portion of the people were bullish, initially panicking. The day before yesterday, the price had suddenly fallen by 0.6-0.7 yuan because of this, and its trading accounted for more than half of the total, which also shows the fervor of speculation. Generally, people believe that the total number of old bonds is around 10 million, and the market will not be greatly affected. Bullish parties are mostly retail investors and arbitrageurs, and bearish parties are mostly large investors. It is rumored that one firm, No. 48, accounts for several hundred thousand yuan, and it is faintly heard that there is still something going on. It is largely similar to the turmoil of the 23rd Customs bond last time, and caution must be taken. Yesterday, because retail investors continued to buy and No. 4 did not continue to sell, the market price was firm. However, the trend is not small and it is not easy to return to high levels. The turmoil should still be in the back. Other various bonds were once pulled up by the 96 bonds by 0.3-0.4 yuan the day before yesterday, but yesterday they returned to 0.1-0.1 yuan, the 23rd Customs bond was up by 0.35 yuan, and the 96 bonds were only down by 0.05 yuan. The trading volume of the 96 bonds still accounts for the majority. The stronghold is being built higher and higher, and its danger is also increasing. The 96 public bonds will have many incidents from now on. Yesterday's market price results were mostly gains and few losses, high and low from 0.05-0.1 yuan to 0.35 yuan, the 96 bonds were only down by 0.05 yuan. The total transaction volume was 8,889,000 yuan. The results of the gains and losses are compared in the table on the left.

<p>Hsin Feng Yang Hing reported that yesterday (1st) the New York stock market saw mixed gains and losses. Due to the instability of silver stocks and the weakness of wheat, bullish investors closed out their positions. The fall in wheat was the result of dumping by the eastern United States and speculators. The highlight of the day was the strong performance of US government bonds, with many creating new highs. Other bonds saw inconsistent gains and losses. Small exchange stocks were also volatile. The total trading volume for the day was 820,000 shares. The Dow Jones index is listed on the left:</p>

<p>The yarn market is mediocre, and the market condition is becoming increasingly scattered. Since a certain gentleman turned bearish in recent months, most people have been looking down, and the target is concentrated on the May contract. Therefore, it is exceptionally weak. At the same time, the sales of spot yarn have turned cold. The future changes will depend entirely on whether the gentleman delivers or not. Yesterday's market situation was also calm.</p>
<p>Golden Rooster Particularly Scattered</p>
<p>At the opening of the morning market for standard yarn, the prices of each month remained stagnant, and the market atmosphere was particularly scattered. Both bullish and bearish parties adopted a wait-and-see attitude, so the transactions were sparse. The market lacked ups and downs. As a result, each month fell 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4 yuan, 0.04 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price. The market situation slightly showed an upward trend at the opening of the afternoon market. Due to the rise in standard gold, each month rose slightly by 0.1-0.2 yuan, but the May contract was particularly weak. It was heard in the second and third trades that the sales of spot yarn were not smooth, and the market price returned. The May contract was further weakened, falling 0.04 yuan compared to the morning closing price, and the far months rose 0.01 yuan. It was found that Yihua sold 400 bales, Hehsing 450 bales, Changfeng 850 bales, Yukang 400 bales, Dafu 600 bales, Renfeng 450 bales, Yongda 350 bales, and Runkang 200 bales. Dafu bought 600 bales, Tongji 450 bales, Yuda 400 bales, Gengfeng 1,350 bales, Changyu 400 bales, and Dafeng 250 bales. The highest, lowest, and closing prices for the day are as follows: Standard Yarn | Highest Price | Lowest Price | Closing Price | Change from Previous Day | Open Interest</p>

<p>Total | 19,00</p>
<p>Spot Yarn at 0.5 Yuan</p>
<p>The sales of spot yarn are still sluggish. It was found that various gangs bought a total of 699 bales today, and the market price fell by about 0.5 yuan. The transaction volume on the previous day (1st) was 855 bales.</p>
<p>Haizhou: 10 bales, Anqing: 20 bales, Xuzhou: 190 bales</p>
<p>Guangdong: 375 bales, Weihaiwei: 25 bales, Xiamen: 10 bales</p>
<p>Ningbo: 10 bales, Changsha: 20 bales, Nanyang: 15 bales</p>
<p>Inland: 59 bales, Shantou: 15 bales, Wuhu: 5 bales</p>
<p>The cotton market is softer this month, but the forward months are still firm. Because of the lack of new sellers, and the retreat of overseas silver, the cotton industry is becoming weak. However, the rise in standard gold is unusually strong. The market situation in the afternoon was slightly firm. The spot cotton business is particularly dull. Yesterday's cotton market was also ordinary.</p>
<p>Forward Zheng Standard Still Firm</p>
<p>At the opening of the morning market for standard cotton, the market atmosphere in the near months was slightly softened, but the far months were firmer. Because short-sellers covered their positions, and the long positions did not move. As a result, the near months did not move compared to the previous day's closing price, and the far months rose 0.05-0.15 yuan. Suddenly, there was tension at the opening of the afternoon market. Because standard gold broke through 90 yuan, scattered short-sellers covered their positions. But after two or three auctions, it returned to calm. With the spot cotton transactions gloomy, and prices of gold rising, prices of goods will inevitably fall. Therefore, people's hearts are still loose. As a result, the current month fell by 0.05 yuan compared to the morning closing price, and the far months did not move. A part of the new cotton in October tended to sell in large quantities. It was found that Meiji sold 4,300 dan, Hehsing 2,400 dan, Taichang 1,100 dan, Runkang 2,100 dan, Yifeng 2,300 dan, Changyu 800 dan, Shengyuan 1,000 dan, Yongda 1,300 dan, and Yikang 1,600 dan. Tongji bought 1,700 dan, Jinchang 1,000 dan, Shenchang 1,000 dan, Shenji 800 dan, Changfeng 2,600 dan, Shengyuan 3,400 dan, Changhe 4,100 dan, Dachangcheng 2,000 dan, Runkang 1,200 dan, and Jifeng 900 dan. The highest, lowest, and closing prices for the day are as follows: Standard Cotton | Highest Price | Lowest Price | Closing Price | Change | Open Interest</p>
<p>May Contract | 33.50 | 33.35 | 33.40 | Down 0.05 | 145,700</p>

<p>October Contract | 33.50 | 33.45 | 33.45 | 0.05 | 14,600</p>
<p>Total | 687,600</p>
<p>High-Priced Raw Cotton Sales Sluggish</p>
<p>The consumption of spot cotton is unusually quiet. Manufacturers do not handle high-priced raw cotton due to the decline in yarn prices. The source of Tonghua is 278 bales. Shandong American cotton 47.00. Shenxin Factory took delivery of 200 pieces of spot goods and sent them to the factory.</p>
<p>Special Margin Increased for Standard Cotton This Month</p>
<p>For the May contract of standard cotton, the Chinese Merchants Yarn and Cloth Exchange will increase the special margin by 3 yuan per dan for new sales and purchases made from May 1, and charge both deposit accounts.</p>

<p>Calm and Without Characteristics</p>
<p>Tuesday, April 30: At the opening of the US cotton market, each month rose and fell by 1-3 points. The market situation was stagnant. Dealers waited and watched. First, it was firm due to the rise in silver prices in London and Monterrey, and then it returned due to long covering and the weak stock and wheat markets. There were showers in West Texas and Oklahoma. In the afternoon, the Bombay gang bought in, and dealers paid attention to the July contract. Current demand was not good, and there were not many sellers. The ground was still firm. The textile industry was bleak. The closing was flat. The spot price did not move, and the futures rose and fell by 1 point. English spot price rose 3 points, and futures fell 1-2 points. Indian cotton speculators bought in, and European exporters bought in old cotton and sold new cotton, saying that Pingguoer fell flat to Robbie, Aomula rose 1.5-2 Robbie, and Bai Luoxi rose 1.77-3 Robbie.</p>
<p>Wednesday, May 1: At the opening of the US cotton market, it was calm and without characteristics. The transaction volume was not large, and the market price rose and fell by 1-2 points.

<h3 id="e201">Grain: The Weakness of the Flour Futures Market Gradually Subsides <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>After the opening of the flour market in the morning, the prices for each month were initially weak and then stabilized. The quoted prices for imported wheat were lower by 0.4 yuan in Chicago and lower by 0.48 yuan in Canada. At the time of opening, due to the good flour sales the day before, sentiment was strong, and the prices were up by about 0.03 yuan compared to the closing prices at the end of the previous month. However, it was heard that major factories had booked three ships of imported wheat due to its cheapness, with prices rumored to be 4.69 yuan or 4.71 yuan. Therefore, yesterday's market sentiment was affected by this, and the opening prices showed weakness, falling by about 0.01-0.02 yuan compared to the previous day. By the opening of the afternoon market, although the sales to customers in the north were not as strong as at the end of the month, they were still continuing, with an estimated 30,000-40,000 bags. Therefore, sentiment for the current month recovered and stabilized. The far months also showed slight improvement due to the rebound in gold prices. Looking ahead, if there are opportunities to continue booking imported wheat, the market should stabilize temporarily. As a result, the current month was down 0.025 yuan, May was down 0.01 yuan, July was down 0.005 yuan, August was unchanged, September was down 0.025 yuan, and October was up 0.021 yuan.</p>

<h3 id="e202">Further Discussion on Ballad Novels <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>— Hanfeng</p>
<p>After writing "A Discussion on Ballad Novels," I obtained Li Boyuan's "Gengzi National Crisis Ballad." Its preface quotes the first paragraph, saying: "Reading the Legend of the Palace of Eternal Life, when Li Guinian narrates the lost tales of the Kaiyuan era, it is impassioned, generous, and thoroughly vivid. Reading also the Legend of the Peach Blossom Fan, when Liu Jingting and Su Kunshang recount the Yangzhou soldiers' mutiny, it is poignantly heart-wrenching, and filled with sorrow and indignation. Because of their extensive and profound writing, with words and tongue both employed, they could recite and sing from afar, tears accompanying their voices. The power of ballad novels to move people deeply and extensively, through the excellence of performers, is evident here. Therefore, the value of ballad novels truly extends beyond what ordinary ballad writers say, which is merely 'to dispel sorrow and pass the time,' and it certainly has its significance."</p>
<p>Ballads and drum ballads have somewhat similar forms. Generally, in the north, the distinction is simple: if accompanied by drums, it's a drum ballad; if accompanied by the three-stringed lute, it's a ballad. Southern ballads, although influenced by drum ballads, incorporate a greater element of folk songs and tunes. Like opera, ballads also have northern and southern styles. Not only that, but they can also be divided into Kunqu, Gaoqiang, Luan Tan, Bangziqiang, Shipaiqiang, Huangqiang, Xianziqiang, Juanqiang, Luoluoqiang, Zhouguziqiang, and so on. These divisions are naturally determined by regional differences. For example, Shipaiqiang is popular in Jiangnan, Huangqiang in Shaanxi, Xianziqiang is prevalent in Zhili, Juanqiang and Luoluoqiang flourish in Henan, and Zhouguziqiang is found in Shandong. These vary by location and cannot be fully listed.</p>
<p>Regarding the organization of chapters, the most complex include several forms: poetry, lyrics, eulogies, suites, and "pianzi," with "pianzi" being the main component. The so-called "pianzi" refers to the sung sections within the chapter. Each section is called a "pianzi," and the number of "pianzi" in each chapter is not fixed. Poetry and lyrics are mostly used for the opening of each chapter or the ending of the entire book. Most writers typically quote works from predecessors, distinguishing between those directly related to the plot and those of general reference. The former often involves original creations, while the latter is gleaned from readily available old texts. Eulogies and suites are added to specific sections based on factual needs, such as the "Moling Autumn" suite at the end of "The Swallow Letter Ballad." Of course, works of other forms can be added at any time, such as the small songs in "The Tale of the Double Jade Cups," the imperial edict in "The Tale of the Double Jade Swallows," and the proclamation in "The Swallow Letter." However, these can be considered exceptions. The number of characters per line in the "pianzi" is mostly seven or ten, with other lengths determined by the necessities of the content, without much restriction.</p>
<p>The writing technique for "pianzi" prioritizes natural rhymes. Another crucial element that significantly contributes to the success of ballads is the lively application of idioms, slang, and popular vernacular, which can make the "pianzi" more vivid and powerful. For example, "Compared to you, he's afraid the cantaloupe is too sweet to eat. Pity him, how can he swallow the unspeakable bitterness?" This usage is so natural and interesting. Secondly, the application of humor is also necessary, as it can refresh the audience's tired spirits. To summarize the principle: the success of a suite depends entirely on applying effort to the eight words: "accessible and easily understood, lively and elegant."</p>
<p>Due to the freedom of form and the flexible use of rhymed vernacular, ballad novels have advantages beyond "describing fine details of things and trivial emotions with utmost care." This format retains the strengths of verse while incorporating prose, developing descriptive narratives that vividly paint scenes with sound and imagery. At the same time, it practically breaks the traditional notion that vernacular and colloquial language cannot be used in writing, proving that when used appropriately, it not only does no harm but also makes the writing more lively and gives readers and listeners a vivid impression.</p>
<p>Attached: Dan Yuan Discusses Four Taboos and Six Necessities for Storytelling</p>
<p>"The first taboo is to widely invite respected and influential guests. The second taboo is to casually discuss lottery tickets and divination slips with fellow villagers. The third taboo is that a blind man can never sing in tune. The fourth taboo is that the host may not understand the silk strings. The necessities are: a clean ground paved with stone and brick. The necessity is: a refreshing and sunny day, cool in summer and warm in winter. The necessity is: a large teacup to quench thirst and promote saliva. The necessity is: a small incense plate for smoking and lighting fire. The necessity is: a boy quickly setting the table. The necessity is: a servant first securing the benches. And then, the sounds of the lute are as bright as snow. The words are spoken, each one rounder than a pearl."</p>
<h3 id="e203">On Poetry and Music <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Junhan</p>
<p>The most important difference between poetry and prose lies in that poetry should have musical rhythm, musical melody, and musical emotion; whereas prose does not.</p>
<p>I recall having previously discussed the uniqueness of language in poetry and thoughts suitable for poetry, as well as the unity of content and form in poetry. Now, let's further discuss the importance of poetry and music.</p>
<p>If poetry lacks the elements of music, it can hardly be considered poetry.</p>
<p>My friend, Ye Jun, brought his poems for me to read. Recently, I also read "Escaping Famine," which he was pleased with. He is indeed someone with great interest in poetry, and he wishes to become a poet himself. Yes, I read his poems with great enthusiasm. However, after reading, I cannot deny that he merely presented the suffering of refugees in the countryside and their escape to the city as factual narratives, written in lines like a poetic form on paper. The direct impression it gave me was that it was no different from a piece of prose. There was nothing else beyond that. Furthermore, the poem lacked emotional components.</p>
<p>"Poetry is music that expresses emotion through words," I said.</p>
<p>If we were to take this as a definition of poetry, it would naturally be biased and incomplete. However, compared to prose, poetry contains the important element of music.</p>
<p>Now, allow me to cite some examples to illustrate the differences between poetry and prose:</p>
<p>"A carpenter might say to his plane:</p>
<p>'Plane, now I will use you to smooth the wood.'</p>
<p>But Carson's poem writes:</p>
<p>'O plane, shave swiftly,</p>
<p>Singing on the workbench;</p>
<p>The board heats up like a copper comb,</p>
<p>Wood shavings flow in torrents.'</p>
<p>Is there a difference between the carpenter's words and Carson's poem?</p>
<p>The difference is significant, even though the subject matter is the same.</p>
<p>The carpenter's words are simply an invitation for the plane to work, while in Carson's poem, we hear the sound of the plane smoothing the wood, and Carson conveys the joy of labor, the poetic sense of labor, and the music of labor.</p>
<p>Therefore, the difference between poetry and prose lies in the fact that poetry has musical rhythm, musical melody, and musical emotion, and it is realistic."</p>
<p>Some poems have rhymes at the end of each line; however, some poems do not have rhymes, but the descriptive phrases still have musical rhythm and harmony.</p>
<h3 id="e204">Mad Woman <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>— Shen Shengshi</p>
<p>This girl, her heart pierced by deep sorrow, went mad.</p>
<p>A mad person reverts to innocence; her expression of pain is so distressing!</p>
<p>At the beginning of the summer vacation, her parents sent her from the hospital to the art school.</p>
<p>For the first few days of class, she was so gentle and intelligent; we didn't know she was mad.</p>
<p>After two weeks, her unfortunate symptoms gradually began to appear.</p>
<p>One afternoon, we saw her dancing the foxtrot alone on the walkway. Many classmates went to watch her; she showed no embarrassment at all.</p>
<p>After that, she stopped attending classes on her own and often played the piano alone in the music room. Accompanied by the tinkling of the piano, she sang Beethoven's mournful tunes in her trembling, hoarse voice, carrying the songs from the gauze window to a lake of slightly green spring water.</p>
<p>Through the wall, we heard her laughing wildly for no reason, laughing so long and so bitterly. Finally, we heard her collapse onto the keyboard and cry!</p>
<p>She was intelligent and beautiful; she had a talent for music and could speak English fluently.</p>
<p>We saw her speaking fluent English to the wall by herself. On another occasion, she embraced a thick osmanthus tree in the corridor and kissed it wildly.</p>
<p>However, we didn't understand the reason for her madness until after she was expelled from the school. Her tragedy then spread throughout the school!</p>
<p>It was said that her fiancé was an American student. When he returned home after completing his studies, like a bolt from the blue, he suddenly died of an acute illness on the ship.</p>
<p>This profound shock shattered her heart; this incurable disease was beyond medical help!</p>
<p>I left the art school three years ago. When I think about that long period of painful struggle, the good dreams of those days, like a thin spring drizzle, vanished. Since then, I have been lonely, letting life drag on my feet, not looking up as I hurry along.</p>
<p>God! Protect my iron heart; don't let me go mad!</p>
<h3 id="e205">Fog <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>— Liu Bing</p>
<p>The dawn on the equator is silent and gentle. However, almost every morning, when we open the window and look out, we find that we are surrounded by a misty white fog. In front of us is a vast expanse of white; we can't see anything clearly. The scene before our eyes is like an overexposed photograph.</p>
<p>The morning fog obscures everything, masking the true appearance of everything on the equator. However, in this hazy atmosphere, I opened my eyes, and I saw through this misty veil. I saw the unvarnished truth:</p>
<p>The rows of rubber trees, in the past, boasted of their value, but now, I see them forcing a smile as they support their heavily wounded bodies. For decades, they have provided exploitation for people. Now, their blood has run dry, their essence has been exhausted, like a critically ill old man, discarded by people as worthless…</p>
<p>I also saw that mountain shining with fiery light. In the past, it was a treasure trove of gold, and many people lived prosperous lives because of it. But now, the mine is desolate, and the cranes on the hillside have long been unattended, leaving only iron skeletons rusting.</p>
<p>In the city, you see those speeding trucks, carrying wealthy men and women. But if you look closely at their faces, their eyes are covered with a shadowy gloom. Their laughter hides glistening tears; they lament their own decline…</p>
<p>The heavy morning fog obscures all of this; people cannot see the truth. The entire equatorial line (perhaps the whole world) is shrouded in fog, causing people to be in a daze.</p>
<p>I imagine everything at the window. I looked at the eastern horizon. When will the golden threads of sunlight break through this dense fog?</p>
<h3 id="e206">Rainbow Clouds <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>— Feng Zikai</p>
<p>This happened last summer.</p>
<p>It hadn't rained for two months. The sun shone for fifteen hours every day. The mercury in the thermometer climbed above one hundred degrees every day. The bottom of the river was exposed everywhere. Ponds became depressions. Weeds turned yellow and stood erect in the gray-white dry soil. The heat's misery and the drought's panic filled everything.</p>
<p>There was no place in the room that wasn't hot. Sitting on a stool felt like sitting on a copper stove. Touching the table felt like touching a chimney. The wax candles bent down from the candlesticks, curving into the shape of a magnet. Mints, left on the table for a while, twisted open and dissolved completely, evaporating. The dog lay panting under the table with its tongue hanging out; people occupied every doorway and fanned themselves tirelessly. Their wrists ached from fanning, and sweat poured out incessantly. Although there was a lot of sweat, drinking water became a problem. Water carried from afar cost four coppers a load, and poured into the water tank, it looked like milk. Water carried from nearby cost ten copper coins a load, and after settling, half a load was mud. Families that could afford to buy water used it sparingly. Water used to wash faces was saved for washing clothes, water used to wash clothes was saved for washing pants, and water used to wash pants was saved for watering flowers. Families that couldn't afford to buy water had small-footed mothers and children of several years old carrying buckets to fetch water from afar. Every day, they worried about the heat, worried about the water, and worried about the drought to come. Fields that were tilled late hadn't been planted yet. The soil had hardened like stone. Seedlings in fields that were tilled early had grown, but they had all turned into withered grass. The entire village was mobilized to tread water. First, they tread water from the big river into the small river, then from the small river into the port and canals, and finally from the port and canals into the fields. But working fifteen hours a day, the water people treaded in wasn't enough to compensate for the evaporation from the sun shining for fifteen hours a day. Today there was news that the crops in the southwest corner had all turned yellow; tomorrow there would be more news that the waterwheels on the canal banks had increased to eight hundred and some. When people met, they initially did nothing but lament helplessly: "What can we do if it just doesn't rain?" "The heavens have completely forgotten about rain!" But later they reached a conclusion, and everyone anxiously told each other when they met: "If it doesn't rain in ten more days, a great famine is coming!"</p>
<p>In the following ten days, everyone was too busy to worry about the heat, staring intently at the sky, hoping for rain. Every morning when they woke up, the first thing they did was ask about the weather, but the weather was just sunny, sunny, sunny… sunny for ten days straight. After the tenth day, it was still sunny, sunny, sunny… sunny for countless days. Some people said despairingly: "Even if it rains right now, it's already too late." But most people still didn't despair: farmers still desperately treaded water, and even the elderly and children came out to participate. The people in the town still looked up at the sky every day, hoping it would rain immediately, or that there would still be a last-minute remedy. The reason they didn't despair was that for more than ten days, there had been a few rainbow clouds hanging in the southeast corner, floating and sinking, sometimes large, sometimes small, sometimes bright, sometimes dim, showing people all sorts of signs that it was about to rain, maintaining a glimmer of hope for them. Sometimes they rose up, grew bigger, darkened, and seemed to say bravely to the people treading water and watching the sky: "Don't despair! We're bringing rain!" So the people treading water increased their courage and treaded even more desperately; the people watching the sky gained hope, happily showing joy and cheering each other: "It's going to rain! It's going to rain!" The elderly shook their hands to stop them: "Don't shout, don't shout, you'll scare it away!" Soon those rainbow clouds were indeed scared away. They gradually sank under the scorching sun, became smaller, faded, dispersed, and finally hid below the horizon. People were happy for nothing and still returned to the heat's misery and the drought's panic. There was a moment of empty joy every day, but every day they couldn't escape the misery and terror. Originally, these rainbow clouds were just hanging there for people to look at, emptily giving people comfort and encouragement. Later, people saw through them. No matter how colorful and dazzling they were, floating in the sky, they just lowered their heads and struggled with the heat and drought, living day by day, no longer falling for those empty rainbow clouds.</p>
<p>This happened last summer. Eventually, it did rain, but it was no use, and the great famine finally arrived. Now, farmers are eating chaff, workers are idle with their tools, and merchants are guarding empty counters, all waiting for the silkworms to mature and the wheat to ripen, no longer recalling the past.</p>
<p>Why am I bringing up old events here now? I once painted a picture of these rainbow clouds during the drought. Now, I've selected sixty paintings depicting the people's livelihood from the paintings I've made since the drought and compiled them into a book. I've put this painting of the rainbow clouds at the beginning and named the book "Rainbow Clouds." This is not just imitating the "Guan Ju" and "Ge Tan," taking the first line as the title. Because I feel that the people's livelihood today is always filled with the heat's misery and the drought's panic, and there are also a few rainbow clouds always hanging before our eyes, constantly comforting us with beautiful forms, encouraging us, and maintaining a glimmer of hope for our future, no different from the situation last summer. So I'm recording this situation as the preface to this book.</p>
<p>After finishing the record, I began to have doubts: Can these rainbow clouds of mine not just be for people to appreciate emptily, emptily to comfort and encourage people? Can they satisfy the longing of the drought era? I know they can't. Because the rainbow clouds depicted here are too small and too few. How can just these few cause abundant rain? I'm afraid they will just be there for people to appreciate emptily and then sink below the horizon.</p>

<p>— Luo Hong</p>
<p>But Youcai didn't even glance at his brother. He just lowered his head and rubbed his bare feet on the ground. After a while, the big toe on his right foot lifted up more than half an inch, like a son, forcefully clamping the calf of the other foot. Only after Youfa finished speaking did he raise his head and stare at his brother in the doorway, saying:</p>
<p>"You always say these things, I'm tired of hearing them! Being a wet nurse can naturally earn some money, but I won't go to Mr. Lu's. We have to borrow money from him, paying two percent interest per month. Why do we have to have the daughter-in-law be a wet nurse before he's willing to lend it? He wants his own son to be well, don't I want my own son to be well? I definitely won't agree. I don't want to have the child taken to someone else's house, becoming pitifully thin like a monkey!"</p>
<p>"I don't think they're being that heartless. They don't like the wet nurse they're using. Her milk is sparse. Your daughter-in-law is young and has a lot of milk. Of course they like her. We just happen to need to borrow money from them, and they're afraid we won't agree, so they want us to agree first." Youfa's eyes darted, sometimes fixed on the ground, sometimes fixed on Youcai's face, as if regretting that he had said too much.</p>
<p>"What do you know? They're the most ruthless. He seems to think two percent interest is too little, deliberately trying to make things difficult for us. I just won't put up with it!"</p>
<p>Youcai raised his voice, and seeing that his brother didn't respond, he said:</p>
<p>"You're afraid of Mr. Lu's shadow as soon as you see it. You're more than ten years older than me, but you have the courage of a sesame seed. What's there to be afraid of? The more you're afraid of them, the more unrestrained they become. I see through them now."</p>
<p>"See through them? I don't believe you see through them. You've become like this because you listened to Hu Yongliang's nonsense." The older brother seemed a little angry, his eyes, filled with red veins, staring hard at Youcai's face, as if asking: "Can you deny my discovery?" After a moment, he lowered his voice and said, "Youcai, don't go learning from Hu Yongliang. That kid has lived in the city for two years, and he looks down on everyone. I don't think he'll have a good outcome. Don't learn from him."</p>
<p>Youcai didn't speak. On his face, tanned the color of soy sauce by the sun, his cheekbones twitched. At this moment, the child in the firewood corner of the room suddenly cried. This clear cry broke through the melancholy silence, and both men breathed a sigh of relief. A woman with a round, dark face walked over from the stove in the next room, picked up the child, and quickly walked away.</p>
<p>"Agree to it, Youcai. Stop saying those resentful words. We poor people can't be like that!" Youfa changed his tone to a gentler one, walked to the table, and picked up a water pipe, as if he wanted to talk with Youcai for half a day.</p>
<p>"Don't say these empty words. I'm just telling you, it won't work if she leaves the house. With both of us busy working in the fields, who will do the cooking? Last year, Sister-in-law went to the city to work. You yourself said that Agen's mother couldn't go, and it was useful to have a woman at home. Now you're saying this again. It's really—"</p>

<h3 id="e208">Rewarding Marriage and Competitive Childbearing <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>— Jiawei</p>
<p>"Cultivate blessings and longevity, many sons and grandsons," this was originally a common saying—no, a "mantra"—in our ancient feudal society! From the mouths of relatives and friends when offering birthday greetings and congratulations, down to the mouths of beggars begging for alms, they all used it.</p>
<p>Indeed, since "the European wind gradually spread east," especially since the "May Fourth Movement," our society has become somewhat "reformed." At the same time, perhaps because of the poor economic conditions and social unrest of today, the lives of many, many people have gradually become difficult, causing panic and forcing them to struggle on the front lines of hunger, cold, and life and death. Thus, this "auspicious saying" of "cultivate blessings and longevity, many sons and grandsons" seems to be threatened today and is no longer sufficiently "universally applicable," right?</p>
<p>As for the "civilized countries" of Western Europe, they are certainly much more "enlightened" than we are. Therefore, there is no doubt that these feudal ideas have long been eradicated, right? Moreover, at present, this group of capitalist imperialist countries is reaching the extreme peak of "panic"; "the power of monopoly is expanding day by day, and the unemployment panic and conflicting contradictions are expanding day by day." So, "many sons and grandsons" are also facing difficulties and threats for them, right?</p>
<p>However, the reality is quite the opposite. Please see the reports in various newspapers the other day about the National Society of Rome: "Italy has become a honeymoon country today, with more than two thousand newly married couples being provided with expenses by the Fascist Party to enjoy their holidays together. Each newly married couple can receive five hundred lire; this is part of the government's marriage promotion plan." Also, Reuters reported: "Yesterday, a total of two thousand three hundred and fifty-three couples held wedding ceremonies in Rome, following the Fascist slogan of 'early marriage' and 'large families.' Most of the new couples are under twenty-five years old, and some are only sixteen years old."</p>
<p>Look! "Early marriage," "large families," "only sixteen years old," "two thousand three hundred and fifty-three couples," truly "mighty," "unprecedented," but for what purpose—"to have noble sons early"!</p>
<p>I remember reading a statistic in the newspaper last month: "According to statistics from the National Socialist Party's Racial Department, Germany's marriage rate in 1934 still holds the record unmatched by any other country. In the first half of the year, there were 334,600 marriages in Germany, an increase of 32 percent compared to the same period in 1933. Germany also ranks first in terms of fertility. Last year, a total of 576,800 people were born. Furthermore, the labor front's newspaper, the 'German People's Daily,' commented that the competition to increase the population must continue, and families with many children should be subsidized."</p>
<p>However, their so-called "encouragement of marriage" and "the competition to increase the population must continue" is not for the sake of "cultivating blessings and longevity"! If we pay attention to the news that various countries are advocating today, such as "rearming," "increasing the national defense budget," "building new ships," "war clouds are tightening, and countries are hoarding wheat," it is not difficult to understand: what kind of role are these "plans" and "records" playing—very simple! They are being processed and competitively manufactured into "cannon fodder" for the Second Great Massacre!</p>
<h3 id="e209">After Becoming Deaf <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>— Ruomu</p>
<p>The city at night opens its bright eyes, its flickering lights illuminating its malnourished and bloodless face, wrinkled with countless lines, making it weaker and more sallow, like faded yellow paper, dimly lit without a trace of light.</p>
<p>On the road, on the night road in the bustling city, the noisy sounds resonate in every corner. To the people living lavishly in this city, these clamorous sounds are like playing happy songs, captivating their hearts. But he, like someone abandoned by the people of this world, does not enjoy these sounds at all, because his hearing is numb, he is deaf. He no longer has the fortune to hear the musical sounds of the city.</p>
<p>He himself also felt inexplicable. Since becoming deaf, he has been envying those who feel happy listening to music. A year ago, when his hearing was still very sharp, he hated the noisy sounds of the city attacking him, sometimes making his uneasy heart even more agitated. He always hoped to escape this city and go to a quiet place. But this kind of thought was an impossible fantasy for him. If he left the city, he would suffer even more pain. The pressure of life forced him to live here. But since he became deaf, this attitude has completely changed. At first, he envied others, but recently he has gradually become resentful. In his heart, a hostile idea emerged. He thought that those who were not deaf were too undeserving, too overbearing towards those who had lost their hearing. It seemed that those who were not deaf, in his opinion, should not exist in this world.</p>
<p>Because of his loss of hearing, his heart became quiet and lonely. However, chaotic thoughts became even more agitated in his heart. This unbearable situation in front of him made him feel more pain when he thought quietly.</p>
<p>He, a forty-year-old man, lost his job because of his deafness, which made his life even more unbearable. Although he had no wife or children, his parents, who were in their seventies, were like a very heavy burden pressing on his shoulders, which had lost their ability to bear weight. It is extremely difficult for a deaf person to struggle alone in the world, but asking him to take on this burden again would crush him to death.</p>
<p>He couldn't help but think of his teaching life before he became deaf. Although he didn't live a very prosperous life at that time, he didn't fall into such a desolate poverty after losing his job. Yes, when he had a job, he was often dissatisfied with his life and hoped for new developments, but that kind of hope would not be realized. On the contrary, now that he has fallen into such an environment, comparing the two lives, he naturally felt that his past life was happy and fulfilling.</p>
<p>"After teaching for so many years, now I'm unemployed and have become deaf."</p>
<p>He often sighed like this, and often had a thought of being tired of the world. He knew that his hope was over. But when he came back from outside and saw the bitter faces of his parents in their seventies struggling on the line of starvation, he had an idea of repaying their nurturing kindness. That kind of thought of taking his own life gradually faded and disappeared in his heart. But the question of "how to live" in front of him made his heart beat faster.</p>
<p>"How to live?" This difficult question was like a thousand-pound stone pressing tightly on his heart. This deaf and unemployed teacher was troubled by this question all day long. All the struggles made him despair and feel the insignificance of life.</p>

<p>— Simon</p>
<p>A pair of eyes that secretly held the passionate emotions of a precocious girl, a unique taste of the South! A Guangdong product, just thinking about it, my heart was captivated by that pair of passionate eyes, dark and round, like longan seeds in summer, emitting piercing red light.</p>
<p>Oh, Luciana, the goddess of love in the heart of my lover!</p>
<p>That day was a troublesome spring afternoon that easily made people dream. Spring is a very suitable season for love. Just as I was about to take a nap, a woman's sharp voice suddenly called out outside the house.</p>
<p>I listened quietly: strangely familiar, could it be Luciana!</p>
<p>Sure enough, Luciana appeared at the door, dressed up and smiling charmingly.</p>
<p>I really jumped up. Luciana was very pretty today: healthy, fair, and rosy complexion, strong arms, full breasts, and her trousers were rolled up high to her knees. The beauty of her thighs was wonderfully condensed in my eyes.</p>
<p>Oh, Luciana, passionate yet with a Western-style vigor!</p>
<p>—Luciana, what's the matter?</p>
<p>—It's spring, let's go horseback riding in the suburbs and spend a boring afternoon.</p>
<p>My drowsy spirit suddenly burst with energy.</p>
<p>The spring fields lay under the gentle spring sunshine, serenely beautiful. The sky was orange-blue, and the clouds were also orange-blue, drifting low above our heads. In the fields, green rapeseed flowers were interspersed with white rapeseed flowers, and the fragrance of green and white rapeseed flowers mixed with the scent of mud wafted in the breeze.</p>
<p>The breeze caressed Luciana's curly hair, and her bangs fluttered.</p>
<p>Spring is really a season for love! Everything was intoxicating. I felt happy. Joyful.</p>
<p>On the road, we sat on horseback, facing the warm wind, moving forward slowly. Luciana gently whistled a popular tune, and I followed along. When we reached the path, I let Luciana run ahead, without any hesitation, like a brave empress, but my heart was fragile.</p>
<p>Do I have a share of love for her, I suddenly asked myself secretly.</p>
<p>Passing through a pond path with tall reeds, Luciana used her hand to move away the obstructing reed branches, and the sharp leaves pricked her thumb, drawing a little blood, but she seemed not to want me to know, and quietly took out a small handkerchief to wipe it, but I saw it clearly.</p>
<p>—Luciana, why is your hand bleeding?</p>
<p>—Nothing, just a little sting.</p>
<p>Luciana turned her head and smiled charmingly, but my heart couldn't help but feel sad.</p>
<p>That red blood is the symbol of love, the symbol of a young girl's passionate youth!</p>
<p>Towards evening, we returned with a bit of fatigue.</p>
<p>A troublesome spring afternoon passed by in such a gentle mood.</p>
<p>It was the first time I played with Luciana.</p>
<p>Luciana has a pair of eyes that secretly hold the passionate emotions of a precocious girl, a symbol of love! When she smiles, it's like a blooming rose, making one think of her bright young body and her bright young youth.</p>
<p>I can hardly forget her for a moment, but I also</p>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>Quietly sediment my young yearning for love, my young silent tenderness, in the depths of my heart, without telling anyone, not even Luciana. But I know that she is smart and sensible, and I know that she also has a young heart of love and yearning like myself, with silent tenderness sedimented in the depths of her heart. Just like myself.—Luciana, when will you let our two silent hearts of love and longing bloom together, tell me!</p>
<h3 id="e211">Another Year, Spring Flowers Fall <a href="#e211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>— Luo Jia</p>
<p>My garden, even though it hasn't become so barren that there isn't a single flower: nevertheless, the pansies huddled in the corner of the wall, the sparse morning glory vines twining around the hibiscus hedge, the maiden-like shy mimosa, and the rustic ten-foot red, they all bloom with some lonely flowers, even the green of the leaves is lonely, like my own mood. They make my garden seem too lonely! I believe that without those flowers, my garden should still have some spring spirit!</p>
<p>There's no need (or maybe I don't want to) rush around the enclosure looking for traces of spring, I plan like this. I know that my current portion of loneliness is a suitable punishment for the excitement and liveliness of the past (to put it lightly, it's an adjustment!). And I am content with this kind of punishment, gladly.</p>
<p>The hazy twilight, like a misty valley, embraces my night garden. Will the night garden be even more lonely? So I took my wisteria cane (I'm a young old man!), stepped into the night garden, and the faint, botanical fragrance generously provided me with gentle breaths. My nerves were a little sharper, so I wanted to open my eyes and prepare to search for something in the twilight garden? Regardless of whether what I found was what I loved. However, what could I get? The dancing posture of the flower branches in the twilight? The evening breeze rippling with the breath of spring?</p>
<p>In the serene thoughts, I don't hope to get anything? Nor do I hope not to get anything? I stubbornly hold on to my past whisper:</p>
<p>"Gain and loss disturb the serene thoughts, this is a cruel act."</p>
<p>So, I closed my eyes. In the lonely veil of the twilight garden, I had a pool of quiet contemplation.</p>
<p>(I said: My contemplation is wasteful, wasted in the weight of memories, floating like a dream, like a yellow leaf, gently blown by the sentimental wind, falling into the sea of thin sorrow, and the lonely twilight garden will be stained with a layer of melancholic color, this is obviously too stupid! Too stupid.)</p>
<p>I cleverly stretched my hand into my pocket, and a cigarette was placed in my white coat. The faint light of the match flashed, but it broke through the silence of the garden. A pair of plum finches roosting on the apricot tree, perhaps not used to the light, flew up and chirped. This, for me, was very unsettling, and at the same time, it was like the gardener's eviction notice. So, I quietly went out!</p>
<p>As usual, every twilight, my feet will step into the garden. I am willing to do so, and weariness cannot take away my hobby.</p>
<p>Today's twilight had a faint moonlight. When I stepped into the garden as usual, closed my eyes and sat quietly, and when I had sat long enough and opened my eyes, preparing to leave this garden, I found some fallen petals, lying there lonely. So, I felt a sense of sorrow for no reason. My emotions are so fragile!</p>
<p>Yes, the flowers in the garden make the garden seem a little more lonely, but I am not used to the weaving of things. I like the ordinary, the normal. I can't bear to see what has been added to my garden? Likewise, I can't bear to see what is missing from my garden? (Because I love the tranquility of my heart, and the tranquility of my heart will be plundered by the changes in things.)</p>
<p>Because of this, I and my garden will suddenly become estranged! The small stone path in front of the garden gate, full of blue bitterness, no longer has my footprints! I have made up my mind like this.</p>
<p>Next year when the flowers bloom, will I still be living here? I dare not think about it.</p>

<h3 id="e214">Random Notes on "The Constant Nymph" <a href="#e214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>— Yunmen</p>
<p>"The Constant Nymph", currently showing in Nanjing, was originally named "Vanessa Her Love Story". Vanessai Her Love Story is one of the four masterpieces of the famous British novelist Hugh Walpole, who specializes in writing about the Herries family of Cumberland, England. When MGM decided to use his work as a script, Walpole himself went to Hollywood to supervise and assist. After the film was completed and became famous, he returned to his home country.</p>
<p>In "The Constant Nymph", of course, the acting talents of the two leading actors, Helen Hayes and Robert Montgomery, are beyond introduction; but Hayes deeply hates the life under the spotlight, so she forbids her own daughter from following in her footsteps. Her only hope in the future is to be a proactive director. At the same time, Montgomery plans to retire and own thousands of acres of fertile land, living the life of a farmer. Agnes Anderson, who made her screen debut as Montgomery's wife, is also a selected standard beauty.</p>
<p>We know that Queen Victoria was the first Empress of India to merge India. She held her Golden Jubilee ceremony in June 1887, and "The Constant Nymph" also features a performance about this grand and solemn ceremony: what is especially rare is that the background, costumes, fashion, etc., are very similar to the real thing.</p>
<p>Several more points are worth noting here: (1) The producer of this film is David O. Selznick, who has contributed to blockbusters such as "David Copperfield", "Viva Villa!", "Little Women", and "Dinner at Eight"; (2) The director is William K. Howard, famous for directing "The Cat and the Fiddle"; (3) Supporting stars include Myrna Loy, Louis Stone, and Otto Kruger. These can guarantee that "The Constant Nymph" is indeed a romantic work that is extraordinary.</p>

<p>Mingxing Film Company is moving, which is quite busy. It is said that they will all move into the new address on Fenglin Bridge in the next few days.</p>
<p>There is a song called "National Soul Song" in "National Soul", which is very beautiful. Yesterday, Gong Jianong, Zhao Dan, Yan Gongshang, Sun Min, and Li Qing practiced in the Mingxing drama department and sang very enthusiastically.</p>
<p>Shen Xiling will finish his "Boat Girl" in the next few days, so there are his sets on the Mingxing studio every day.</p>
<p>Xu Xinfu's newly compiled "Jade Horse" has passed the preliminary review. On the 30th, the cast was called together in the Mingxing director department to lecture on the plot. The main characters in the film are Wang Zhengxin, Gong Jianong, Yan Yuexian, Zhao Dan, and Gu Lanjun.</p>
<p>The second issue of Mingxing Bi-Monthly has been published on schedule. It is expected that the sales will be more than the first issue because the content is more exciting than the first issue.</p>
<p>The Lianyou Film Association has been quite active since its internal reorganization. The original members who have re-registered and those who have heard the news and went to register are extremely enthusiastic because the association's purpose is pure, so it is very developed.</p>

<p>Most celebrities in the capital live an enjoyable life, but martial arts star Wu Lizhu is different. She does not go to dance halls but likes to ride horses and drive cars. These days, the weather is mild and full of spring, so she drives to Longhua, Zhenru, and Wusong to fully enjoy the natural beauty.</p>
<h3 id="e217">Sky Burial in Tibet <a href="#e217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>Tibet has a strange custom called sky burial, which is that after a person dies, their skin is peeled off, and then the flesh is scraped off, mashed together, and the bones are also crushed, mixed together, and let the divine vulture fly over to eat them. The crew of Yueming Film Company completely captured this tragic scene on camera. According to Wang Hanxiong, after he finished shooting at that time, he couldn't eat anything all day.</p>
<h3 id="e218">Secret Screening of "Mad Marriage" <a href="#e218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>Yueming Film Company's first all-dialogue sound film "Mad Marriage" has now been completed. A secret screening was held at the Central Grand Theatre on Six Horses Road at 11:00 PM the night before. All attendees were company colleagues. It lasted until 1:30 AM. As a result, except for some minor changes to the editing, the photography and sound recording were unanimously considered satisfactory.</p>
<h3 id="e219">Yuan Meiyun Gets Married <a href="#e219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>A reporter visited Yihua Film Company to see Yuan Congmei's sound film "Storm" and saw the lead actress Yuan Meiyun. After some small talk, the reporter asked Yuan if she had ever been married. At that time, everyone in the studio focused their eyes on Yuan Meiyun, secretly guessing that a blush of shyness must appear on her face, but unexpectedly, she did not show any shyness at all and answered very generously, "I am already married." "Already married?" the reporter asked in surprise, "When, where, and to whom did you get married?"</p>
<p>Everyone in the studio looked strangely surprised.</p>
<p>"I got married once with Wang Yin in Shi Dongshan's film 'The Beginning of Man'."</p>
<p>"Hahahaha!" A burst of laughter erupted in the studio.</p>
