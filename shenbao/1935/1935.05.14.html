<p>— 彥</p>
<p>財政部長孔祥熙氏對於截至民國二十三年六月三十日北之既往兩年財政狀况。已撰成詳細報告。於昨日正式發表。（全文見今日本報第三張）該報告之內容。不僅將兩年問之財政狀况。作概括之說明。俾國人了然於過去之國家財政。而於今後政府經濟建設注重之點。及其進行。亦提出綱要如次。</p>
<p>（一）勵行更有效力之預算制度。以控制支出。</p>
<p>（二）淸理愆期債務。</p>
<p>（三）整理鹽稅。施行劃一稅率。撤銷附稅。改良盬質。對於生產運輸。加以嚴密之管理。</p>
<p>（四）整理關稅稅則。務求稅收增加。而不影響於工業用品及一般民衆日需品。至特種輸出物產。在可能範圍內。减輕或全免出口稅。以資鼓勵。</p>
<p>（五）繼續設法調整並減輕省市地方稅。使與中央稅制收內外相維之效。</p>
<p>（六）獎勵並統制國內重要實業。如棉紗棉布生絲等類。</p>
<p>（七）穩定貨幣。並統一輔幣。以鏟除工商業之障礙。</p>
<p>（八）改進交通。尤以發展鐵路及公路爲最要。</p>
<p>（九）救濟立國根本之農業。並謀農村經濟之發展。</p>
<p>以上九項。就我人所知。有已先後實施者。有正在計劃進行者。事實固班班可考。就其巳收成效者觀之。如第二項愆期債務之淸理。只以倫敦市塲外債價格而論。一年以來。已隨英法借欵餘欠全數清償及克利斯浦債券積欠本金償付計劃。而呈空前之飛漲。此所以增高我國對外之信譽也。其次。政府於貨幣政策之努力。亦爲有目共見之事。省銀行或地方銀行兌換劵限制辦法之制定。卽爲安定地方幣制之一端。而一年來我國貨幣上之最大困難。當爲美國白銀政策之威脅。我財政當局能取沉着態度。以爲應付。既以銀出口稅及平衡稅之採用。以制止白銀大量出口。對於最近美國一再提高銀價。復以「紳士協定」之締結。消風浪於無形。凡此種種。所以表示政府於貨幣之穩定之一片苦心也。尤重要者。孔財長之報告。復指出財政極度困難之今日。政府仍注意經濟建設。以爲民族復興之途徑。其所列舉之交通實業建設之各項成績。實中國數十年來所未見者也。故也孔財長之報告。其苦其之精神。躍然可見。殊不能以尋常之政治報告視之也。</p>

<p>先是陳濟棠指朱卓文與第一集團總部諮議袁帶二人、在中山縣地方、組織民軍、私運軍機、圖謀不軌、乃于去月令飭梁公福部、開往該地駐防、嚴重監視、並密令於必要時、將朱袁二人逮捕解省訊辦、嗣於本月一日、特加派仲凱軍艦赴石岐接應一切、並令梁立即拘捕朱袁、梁奉命後一面令飭該團官兵、日夕嚴重佈防、同時派出精幹密探數十名、握守該鎮各處要隘、一面設計誘朱超凡脫俗就範、迨至六日、梁特發出請帖、請朱等于是日下午六時、在石岐張添記酒樓聚讌、同時令飭團副張某率領士兵一連、配備手溜彈輕便機關槍等武器、從南門駐紮地分頭出動、沿途取黃蜂陣勢、紛由各街道包抄前進、及抵達目的地後、即下令士兵配上刺刀、排列通衢、如臨大敵、當時該鎮各馬路街巷行人車輛、臨時一律不准通過、各交通道口、皆設置輕便機關槍數挺、一時居民莫知所以、咸相走避、風聲鶴唳、人心惶惶、同時該鎮各舖戶、以為發生戰事、皆相繼紛紛將閘關閉、繁盛商鎮、頓時寂靜、有如鬼墟、至六時許、朱果帶隨從降士董元應約而至、惟仍未知已中計也、當飲讌時、前縣長梁鴻光任內之財政局長吳志強、公安局長李紹欽、省參議（中山縣代表）李成、該縣第四區區長鄭仲楚、及當地耆紳吳鼎等八人、亦同在席、迨酒過數觥、上至第八菜時、梁公福即下令在門守候之衛隊上樓舉槍侍立、並喝令在席各人起立舉手、隨令衛兵將朱扣留、時朱之隨從衛士董元睹狀、欲拔短槍抵抗、奈被監視衛兵所發覺、即上前將械繳去、並解朱到團部辦公廳、梁遂出陳濟棠之密令與朱看、朱則默默無方、旋該縣前任局長李紹欽吳志強李成及當地耆紳等、聯赴教導師第二團部謁員梁公福、要求保出朱卓文、梁答以係奉到上峯命令辦理、所請實難照准、故各人不得要領而回、朱卓文被捕後、梁公福又派出武裝士兵一連、馳赴該鎮長堤永樂酒店門前、包圍至水洩不通、仍由團副張某曁連長排長等數人、皆擬開槍拒捕、惟袁帶終以從寡懸殊、恐爆火後、盡遭格殺、乃禁令衛兵、暫不放槍、靜待解決、時各官兵見袁等不敢抵抗、遂先將各衛兵掃數繳械、繼將袁帶鎖以鐵鐐、並另獲三人、（姓名未詳）一並解往仲凱軍艦、將袁等押來廣州、越半句鐘後、復加派大隊官兵、重往永樂酒店二樓、細加搜查、似係搜捕餘黨、惟袁之餘黨多已聞風飛遁、無從弋獲矣、</p>
<p>梁公福捕獲朱袁二人後、即於是晚十一時許、標貼佈告文云「現奉第一集團軍總司令部命令內開、現據確報、中山縣建設局長朱卓文、與大部諮議袁帶、在中山地方私運軍械、組織民軍、圖謀不軌、仰該團長設法緝捕、解部　辦為要此令等因、奉此、查該二逆胆敢在中山縣地方私運軍械、組織民軍、危害地方、殊屬不支之極、當於六日將該逆擒獲、並於即日解省歸案、首要旣經獲案、附從概應免治、仰各商民人等、一體知照、毋得驚擾、此佈、」</p>
<p>袁帶押解到廣州後、經由陳濟棠派軍法處長李景熹審訊一過、乃送往憲兵司令部寄押、至朱卓文則仍留在中山縣、由梁團看管、陳濟棠得報、七日、派公安局長何犖赴中山縣審訊、並指朱派人在廣州市惠愛路某金飾店中訂製得圓形細小證章共一萬餘個、第一批訂製數目追究訂製此項證章之由來、朱當否認此證章與彼有關惟是晚三時、梁公福又奉陳濟棠令將朱殺害矣、</p>
<p>據聞朱卓文被扣留後、朱之親信人員即紛紛來省營救、當時西南政務會常務委員鄒魯、以朱氏追隨總理　　革命數十年、實有功於黨國不少、特繕函陳濟棠請予保釋、聞當時陳即復函與鄒、大意謂已照准提省訊辦故一般為朱說情者、以陳允將來朱解省、則此案尙有轉園之餘地、同時各方要人、亦請陳濟棠顧念元勳准予保釋朱氏之電、紛至沓來、有如雪片飛下不知陳濟棠旣具殺朱決心、特令梁團不將朱解省、正所以避各方說情也、（八日）</p>

<h3 id="c104">中華民國二十一年及二十二年兩會計年度財政報告 <a href="#c104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>（一）緒言</p>
<p>二十一年度以前之中央財政報告已由宋前部長編訂提出二十二年十月祥熙奉命繼長財部其時二十一年度方始告終各項報告材料尚未搜集齊全適值交替未及趕辦二十三年一月舉行第四屆四中全會十二月舉行五中全會祥熙曾先後製財政報告送請察閱茲特綜合前兩次報告加以整理　成二十一年及二下二年兩會計年度之詳細報告並附陳二十三年度開始以來之財政概況如左</p>
<p>二十一年度上半期適當一二八事變之後國難嚴重政府同人　勤惕萬及汲不邊軍政各費力求撙節同時國民愛國之忱亦非常熱烈政府得以改訂內債償還辦法减輕國庫負担收支勉可平衡迄二十二年春夏之交贛省剿匪工作方殷而榆熱告急平津戒嚴餉糈支出爲數益鉅及軍事略定戰區救濟需欵復多入秋以後黃河巨浸成災閩省叛變復繼之而起賑欵之籌措軍餉之支給幾於應接不暇故在二十一年度下半期與二十年度上半期中實爲兩會計年度內財政最困難之時代</p>
<p>財政收入向恃關稅爲大宗自二十年後世界經濟恐慌波及我國物價低落銀價增高影響國際貿易關稅收入因之短絀加以東北四省關鹽兩稅全部喪失而外債之由各該省稅收指抵之一部份更須另籌彌補政府債務之負担遂益加重</p>
<p>所幸關稅改用金單位增加進口稅率以及財稅行政之改善故稅欽收入尚未至大量縮减然上項設施其所增加之收入遠不及前項損失之多</p>
<p>基於上述種種原因政府財政不敷之數仍不得不恃債欵收入以爲抵補計二十一年度借債額爲八千六百萬元二十二年度借債額爲一萬四千七百萬元惟同時償還債欵二十一年度約一萬萬元二十二年度約一萬一千五百萬元兩相比較借入之數與償還之數尚能相抵</p>
<p>迥溯二十二年度之初期政府彌補財政之不足尚可籍銷售舊存債券及挪借臨時欵項勉資應付及二十二年十月因需要愈迫羅屈俱窮逐行二十二年關稅庫券一萬萬元以資週轉</p>
<p>祥熙履任之始適值財政萬分竭蹶之時綜計每月收支相抵不敷之數常達一千五六百萬元際此軍事方殷災黎待賑既不能裁减大宗支出貽削足適屢之護有整頓稅收以裕歲計爰就捲菸火柴水泥三種統稅稅率酌予增加並將麥粉煤油汽油及其他少數舶來品關稅稅則酌爲改訂復開微洋米洋麥進口稅一面規畫改革鋻以圖增加收入惟是出入不敷爲數過鉅而稅收增進又非旦夕可期況當變亂初平金融奇緊安定市面亟待籌謀又以中央銀行熱欵過多亦應設法償還因是復發行二十三年關稅庫券一萬萬元以充償還墊欵及安定金融之用</p>
<p>考全部歲出之中軍務費雖仍占第一位計二十一年度軍費支出爲三二一·〇〇〇〇·〇〇〇元二十二年度爲三七三·〇〇〇·〇〇〇元然其數字增益之原因則由於此一年度之收支報告中軍務費所包含之範圍較廣如各部會間之開支屬於軍務費範園者多於此時期中報由本部轉賬以及歷年軍務費在此兩年度內次第轉賬者亦均經列入報告此項補列之欵二十一年度爲五千九百萬元二十二年度爲四千六百萬元此外一部份建設費用如剿匪區域公路之興築農村之救濟亦有由軍務費項下支付者從實際上考之兩年度之軍務費尚未超過以前各年度此蓋由於軍事當局體恤民艱力祟儉約含辛茹苦不肯多所取求故討逆剿共之事前後相乘而軍費之增加爲數尚復有限現在贛省匪集巢業已摧陷廓清流竄川黔之一部份剿辦亦極順利如匪患能早日蕩平則軍費之减低固意中事也</p>
<p>公債市塲之漲落足以覘政府之信用與社會之安危兩年以來內外債價格均有起色自二十一年十二月十五日起至二十四年二月二十五日止一九一三年之善後借欽債票在倫敦市塲已由七七漲至九九·七五又一八九八年借欵債票由九七·五漲至一〇五又一九零八年英法借欵債票由七三漲至九九·七五所有內債情勢雖經兩次發行庫券而市價反見增高蓋因政府整理舊債餒密保管公債基金能使國內外人民信任政府之心日趨於堅定也</p>
<p>惟本時期中全世界經濟恐慌我國亦不能獨免通貨之收縮物價之跌落工商業之衰頽在在皆予財政上以重大之打擊加以國外購買力異常薄弱英美各國復厲行國貨幣政策如金鎊日元美金等幣值均行貶損致我國銀元之金比價日益增高而國際貿易遂更形不振</p>
<p>二十三年秋間國內金融情形緊迫日茶美國國會復於其時通過購銀法令我國國內存銀源源外流出口數目之鉅爲歷年來所僅見政府爲維護國內存銀及遏制國幣價格上漲計乃不得已加增銀出口稅及開微平衡稅籍謀節制數月以來白銀出口逐漸减少市面已路形穩定然貨幣金融仍爲我國當前嚴重問題政府對於整頓金融救濟市面獎勱生產提倡國貨種種措施正在竭力籌畫以圖度過離關而全世界方在驚濤駭浪之中猶不能不慄慄危懼也</p>
<p>（二）收支</p>
<p>二十一年度所有支出均以二十年度預算爲準二十二年度總概算由主計處核編但收支實數仍以財政部帳冊爲憑下表所列卽依據兩年度內接到之各項牧支報告爲編訂之材料並非將應收應支之欵一併計入故表內數字含有屬於以前年度之收支而在本年度內報告者至本年度未據報告之收支亦當遞列於次年度表內</p>
<p>又本部前以中央各機關經管收支欵項應由國庫統一處理曾經擬定辦法提請核準施行自二十二年一月實施後中央各機關之收支欵項一部份已併入下列表內比較以前各年度之收支表較爲詳盡</p>

<p>（三）關稅</p>
<p>關稅稅率之高下與國民生息息相關政府於此自不能不統籌兼顧二十二年五月修訂進口稅則將織品紙張及魚介海產品等稅率略予增加是年冬開征米麥進口稅並提高麥粉進口稅率以維護國內農民之利益旋爲增益稅收計對於煤油汽油稅率亦略予提高至二十二年度將屆終了時復將全部進口稅則斟酌損益重行修訂此項新稅則已於二十三年七月施行</p>
<p>水災附加稅原定按照進出口稅則附片白分之十至二十一年八月一日乃改征百分之五復爲彌補歲計起見另附征百分之五海關附加稅施行期間初定爲一年現已展長至二十四年六月底止</p>
<p>二十二年四月六日開始征收銀錠銀條銀塊等出口稅從價百分之二·二五但中央造幣廠所鑄廠條及銀幣之出口則概予免征查此項百分之二·二五出口稅率適與中央造幣廠鑄造廠條銀幣所取鑄造費相等意在利用稅率使全國銀價得其平衡　於二十三年十月以白銀流出過多逐自十五日起開征廠條及銀幣出口稅百分之七·七五加征大條寶銀及其他銀類出口稅至百分之十又規定如倫敦銀價折合上海匯兌之比價與當日核定匯價相差之數除繳納上述出口稅而仍有不足時則按其不足之數並行加征平衡稅關於以上兩點其詳細情形具載於錢幣一節中</p>
<p>政府原定計劃擬將阻磚國內貿易各種關稅一律廢除如復進口稅子口稅及內地常關稅等自二十年起均已次第裁撤至轉口稅一項擬與上述各稅同時廢除但因財政上驟减鉅量收入不能不先籌抵補之法故暫時保留仍擬在最短期間內毅然裁撤一年以來政府對於運輪國外及國內之出口轉口各稅已經分別减免如花生花生仁花生油曁蛋及蛋製品等項於二十二二十三兩年間先後减征出口稅至米麥等糧食向爲轉口征稅出洋禁止之物品近以價格低落銷路停滯自二十二年一月起弛其禁令免征出口轉口兩稅迨二十三年六月復將全部出口稅則重行修訂大都改用較低稅率其餘完全鐲免者達六十餘種之多本年內擬仍繼續酌量爲多數之减免凡此種種實深鑒於近年出口貿易一落千丈國內農村瀕於破產故不惜犧牲鉅額之稅收以圖挽救也</p>
<p>稅則提高偷漏更所難免故對於緝私設備亦經加意整理以期防範嚴密如添造巡艦增設巡隊創置無綫電等項無不力事擴張一面頒布海關緝私條例並於海陸空入口各處增設關卡以遏私運之來源兩年以來偷運之風雖未盡戢然緝私成續確已大著據海關調查從前有若干種物品多係偷運進口者今均照章繳稅矣</p>
<p>二十二年春廢兩改元實行後出口稅轉口稅所用之關平銀兩同時廢止一律改用銀本位幣海關從量稅所用之度量衡亦於二十三年二月間採用新標準制</p>

<p>（附註一）本表係以關平銀一兩折合銀元一·五五八元計算故與以</p>
<p>前年度報告列數用關平銀一兩合一·五五元計算者微有出入</p>
<p>上表各數內未將帶征各附加稅列入茲再將最近三年份關稅各項收入連同各附加稅一併列表如左</p>
<p>民國二十一年　民國二十二年　二十二十三年</p>
<p>（一九三二）　（一九三三）　（一九三四）</p>

<p>總數　三一·九七五·〇〇〇元　三三九·五二三·〇〇〇元　三三四·六四五·〇〇〇元</p>
<p>海關稅收自二十年以後比較下降泰半由於進口貨物總值之遞减二十二年進出口總值除東北四省不計外僅及二十年三分之二至二十三年之進出口總值則比較二十二年復跌落百分之二十此外因華南華北走私之盛行對於關稅之减收自亦不無影響</p>
<p>關稅减低之另一原因爲東北四省關稅之喪失四省關稅收入包括大連關在內照二十年度計算幾達四千萬元此項稅收旣全數喪失而舊日指定擔保外債之部份亦同歸無着致政府於减少收入外復增加擔負</p>

<p>（四）鹽務</p>
<p>本時期內，鹽稅收數，頗見增益·而鋻務行政亦力求改進，綜其興革之要點，分列如：</p>
<p>（一）裁併機關我國鹽務機關，承襲歷代遺制，又因各地情形不同，組織各別，政府爲集中權力節省經費起見，先後酌予裁併，現在各地鹽務行政，已多併歸稽核所兼管。</p>
<p>（二）革除陋規各區員司，需索陋規，積習相沿，由來已久，尤以揚子各岸爲甚，現已極力革除，務期鹽商成本得以减輕。</p>
<p>（三）整理稅率各區稅率，輕重不同，負擔既不平均偷運之風更盛，政府爲均稅起見，二十一年七月，曾就各產鹽區域，施以初步之整理，二十二年十月，復就銷岸各區酌量增减，爲第二步之整理，又於二十三年一月一日，通令，凡食鹽正附稅總額，爲每担十元至十三元者，一律限制爲十元，另加外債附稅三角，鹽坨建築附稅一角，其在十元以下者，則俟將來察酌各地情形，徐圖改善。</p>
<p>（四）改用標準衡制本部於二十三年一月一日，通令改用新衡制，（每一市擔等於五〇基羅格蘭姆—一一〇，二三磅）以代替習慣各異之本位。</p>
<p>（五）建築倉坨就產地建築鹽坨，以備儲藏，並修築道路，開闢溝港，以便運輸，俾所產之鹽，得迅達儲藏之所，且易於緝私，此項建築工程，淮北長蘆鹽區，已次第完竣，現漸推行於山東淮南兩浙福建廣東等區。</p>
<p>（六）建築堆棧擬逐步建築倉庫於銷鹽中心區域，使各處運來鹽斤胥儲藏其中，庶於集收運銷，及征收鹽稅，各得其便。</p>
<p>（七）改編稅警對於稅警改編，首先裁汰老弱，招募精銳，整頓紀律，兼創立稅警官佐訓練所，施行以來，頗具成績。全國各區鹽稅對於外債本息基金之攤額，除東三省，及口北區，因受特殊影饗外，餘均按期匯解，而對於湖廣鐵路借欵所撥鹽稅且超過原有合同規定應攤之數并敷每年該借欵全部付息之用。</p>
<p>茲將民國二年至二十二年份鹽務稅欵收數列表如左</p>
<p>年份　國幣稅收總數</p>
<p>民國二年　一九，〇四四，二〇〇元</p>
<p>三年　六八，四八三，三〇〇元</p>
<p>四年　八〇，五〇三，四〇〇元</p>
<p>五年　八一，〇六四，八〇〇元</p>
<p>六年　八二，二四五，八〇〇元</p>
<p>七年　八八，三九三，七〇〇元</p>
<p>八年　八七，八二二，五〇〇元</p>
<p>九年　九〇，〇五二，四〇〇元</p>
<p>十年　九四，八八三，一〇〇元</p>
<p>十一年　九八，一〇六，七〇〇元</p>
<p>十二年　九一，四〇六，七〇〇元</p>
<p>十三年　八七，九〇八，六〇〇元</p>
<p>十四年　九一，九三一，六〇〇元</p>
<p>十五年　八六，三一七，二〇〇元</p>
<p>十六年　五九，七五三，三〇〇元</p>
<p>十七年　五四，二七六，六〇〇元</p>
<p>十八年　八五，三七〇，五〇〇元</p>
<p>十九年　二九，六九三，〇〇〇元</p>
<p>二十年　一五五，一一二，六〇〇元</p>
<p>二十一年　一四五，二九二，二〇〇元</p>
<p>二十二年　一五九，一一四七，一〇〇元</p>
<p>二十三年　一七五，九五〇，〇〇〇元</p>
<p>上表所列二十一年份稅收短少原因係由東北稅收全數喪失之故若將以前年分東北數省收數剔除不計則近年鹽稅之增收愈爲顯著（註）</p>
<p>（註）瀋陽事變之前兩年東北四省鹽稅收數每年平均爲二四·六五五·〇〇〇元若將民國十八年至二十三年該四省收數剔除不計則逐年之稅收數目如下</p>
<p>十八年六一，〇七〇，七〇〇元　十九年一〇四，五八一，一〇〇元</p>
<p>二十年一三四，一一二七，六〇〇元　廿一年一四二，一八四，八〇〇元</p>
<p>廿二年一五九，二四七，一〇〇元　廿三年一七五，九五〇，〇〇〇元</p>
<p>（五）稅務</p>
<p>本期內稅務制度漸趨統一卽鑛產稅烟酒稅等亦擬畫入統稅範圍之內以期易於膂理一面遵照第二次財務會議議决案自二十三年度起酌提一部分印花稅收入補助各省市縣經費關於檢查事務卽責成各省市縣政府辦理而各省印花烟酒稅局仍負隨時抽查之責復由財政部派員分往督察以促進行至烟酒牌照稅則完全移歸各省政府以抵補廢除苛捐雜稅之不足</p>
<p>關於捲烟棉紗麥粉水泥火柴等五種統稅在本期內均經積極整理並酌量增加稅率成績漸有可觀統計五種統稅收入總數二十二年分爲八五·〇〇〇·〇〇〇元二十三年分爲一一〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇元若將印花稅烟酒稅收數併入計算二十二年分合計爲一〇〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇元至微收費用則統稅開支較少印花烟酒稅因分機關甚多比較略大茲將統稅及印花烟酒稅微收情形分述於左</p>
<p>捲烟統稅　捲烟統稅推行之始仿照海關稅率定爲七級制十九年十月改爲三級制二十年初因改訂海關進口稅則捲烟稅率亦略有修正二十一年因舶來烟品改歸海關徵收復將國製捲烟改爲二級制稅率略增二十二年十二月再行改訂較高之稅率稅收史有增進茲將歷年捲烟稅收數列左</p>
<p>十七年（十一個月）　國幣一二·〇〇〇·〇〇〇元</p>
<p>十八年　三三·〇〇〇·〇〇〇元</p>
<p>十九年　三五·〇〇〇·〇〇〇元</p>
<p>二十年　五〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇元</p>
<p>二十一年　五五·〇〇〇·〇〇〇元</p>
<p>二十二年　五八·〇〇〇·〇〇〇元</p>
<p>二十三年　七一·〇〇〇·〇〇〇元</p>
<p>麥粉統稅　麥粉稅收二十一年度因受滬變影響頗爲减色　就稽徵方面竭力整頓二十二年每月平均稅收已超過二十一年百分之十五至二十三年稅收更有增進</p>
<p>棉紗統稅　棉紗統稅收數二十一年分超過一千八百萬元二十三年分巳達二千三百萬元惟棉紗市塲極感致落財政部及全國經濟委員曾之棉業統制委員會正在籌議救濟方案　謀國內產棉及紡織業之復與棉紗稅率亦正在審議修改中</p>
<p>火柴水泥統稅　火柴及水泥統稅自推行以來收入已逐漸增加二十二年稅務署爲明瞭商情以便厘定稅率及等級不至隔閡起見關於火柴市塲及各地火柴質地曾作一次詳細之調查是年十二月遂將該兩項稅率同時提高蓋調查之結果察知國內火柴與水泥兩業就現在情形觀之尚能抵抗舶來品之競爭且稅率所增甚微於商情並無妨碍而稅收則可增益至一倍以上</p>
<p>烟酒稅　數年以來烟酒稅制度迭經改善其較著者爲各省十酒定額稅之厘定以及各局卡管理事權之集中此種改革施行未久故尚未能得相當之比較但因管理較嚴稅收額數業見增加而徵收費用亦有减少之希望此項設施其主旨爲去繁就簡畫稅制俾得漸進於統稅制度</p>
<p>啤酒稅　亦仿照統稅制定就廠徵稅並由從價徵收改爲從量徵收以謀稽徵檢查之便利改革以後收數已見增加</p>
<p>洋酒稅於二十一年八月改定由微收海關進口稅時一次徵收比較以前稅收較爲確定且能避免種種糾紛國內機製酒稅亦經逐步整頓力求達到普遍公允之目的</p>
<p>烟葉稅原分土烟葉薰烟葉兩種品質各殊稅率亦異嗣因烟商常將薰烟冒充土烟報稅徵收甚感困難逐將兩種烟葉改徵同一稅率並將海關轉口稅免除稅收數目按年均有增加</p>
<p>印花稅　花稅票巳於二十三年十一月改由各省郵局代售以圖節省徵收費用便利商民購貼並剔除從前包銷攤派之煩苛同時將原有印花稅暫行條例詳加修訂擬就印花稅法草案業已經過立法程序由國府公布但尚未定期施行</p>
<p>（六）第二次全國財政會議</p>
<p>近年以來農村破產百業凋敝財政部爲解除人民痛苦復與農村經濟計曾經擬訂减輕田賦附加廢除苛捐雜稅辦法呈准通令各省次第施行旋以上項辦法與地方預算具有連帶關係不能不統籌兼顧以期通行無阻因於二十三年五月召集第二次全國財政會議集各省市財政當局各關係部會代表及經濟財政專家於一堂經縝密之研討議决要案多伴茲舉其最要者如下</p>
<p>（一）减輕田賦附加　以前所有田賦附加訂定原則分期减除以後則著爲明令永不再加並議定土地陳報鋼要以爲淸丈與淸賦之入手辦法</p>
<p>（二）廢除苛捐雜稅　議定自二十三年七月起至二十三年十二月底化由地方斟酌情形分別先後次第廢除</p>
<p>（三）改善稅制　關於地方大宗收入之營業稅牙稅契稅參酌地方實際情形議定各種章則以期改革　弊增進稅收並及其他稅制之改進經徵制度之畫一均經分別擬具方案籍利推行</p>
<p>（四）確定地方預算辦法　議定畫分省縣地方收入支出之標準及統收統支辦法以期維持省縣收支之平衡而促進地方事業之發展</p>
<p>（五）發展國民經濟　議定提倡生產獎勵貿易遍設農工銀行各案以圖國民經濟之漸次發展</p>
<p>（六）補助地方支出　自下年度起將烟酒牌照稅畫歸地方微收並將中央印花稅收入提撥四成以補助地方廢除苛捐雜稅後之不足</p>
<p>中央財政與地方財政休戚相關必通力合作方能收指臂之效自此次會議之後中央與地方之連瑣關係愈增緊密並賴各地方長官一致努力對於議决各案次第進行據最近統計各省報告廢除之苛捐雜稅約有三千餘種减少人民負担年約二八，〇〇〇，〇〇〇元其成續已略可覩矣</p>
<p>（七）債務</p>
<p>自國難發生各項內國債券改訂償還辦法以後政府厲行緊縮力謀收支適合二十一年度內並未發行公債以充經常費用然其間因收入短絀益以華北軍事供億浩繁需欵益迫除由中央銀行陸續借熱外仍於二十二年二月發行二十二年愛國庫券二千萬元籍供臨時軍費之用至二十二年度則因禦侮及剿匪工作需費基鉅不得已續行舉債以資週轉計截至最近止共發行下列各項債券</p>
<p>發行日期　名稱　數額</p>
<p>二十二年十月　二十二年關稅庫券　國幣　一〇〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇元</p>
<p>二十三年一月　二十三年關稅庫券　一〇〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇元</p>
<p>二十三年一月　上海銀行團意退庚欵借欵　四四·〇〇〇·〇〇〇元</p>
<p>合計　二四四·〇〇〇·〇〇〇元</p>
<p>上列二十三年關稅庫券係指定專充償還中央銀行積熱之用此外於二十二年十月另發行華北戰區救濟短期公債四百萬元指定以長　鹽稅附加及其他種稅收爲基金專供救濟華北戰區災民之用</p>
<p>二十三年內財政部復會同鐵道部發行兩種債券專充鐵道建設資金其一爲玉萍鐵路公債一千二百萬元充完成杭州至南昌及萍鄉鐵路之用又其一爲二十三年六厘英金公債一百五十萬鎊充完成粵漢鐵路之用</p>
<p>本時期內對於愆期債欵之整理亦經循序漸進一九零八年英法借欵之愆期本息業由鹽稅項下分期撥付截至去年十月止已經全數淸償本年一月復頒布淸理克利斯浦借欵愆期本金辦法預計該項借欵之愆期本金至民國二十九年可以一律淸理完竣最近交通部已着手淸理舊債鐵道部亦有整理舊債之計畫至其他無確實担保之內外債尚待整理者均在政府籌慮之中一俟經濟狀况漸趨安定自當繼續進行整理</p>
<p>棉麥借欵二十年政府因救濟水災曾與美國訂立四十五萬噸美麥貨欵是爲棉麥借欵之動機逮二十二年五月宋前部長蒞美與彼邦金融復興公司訂定借欵備充購買美國棉麥之用借欽總額原定爲美金五千萬元至二十三年二月復與金融復與公司商定削减總額爲美金二千萬元其中以一千萬元購美棉六百萬元購美麥四百萬元購美粉</p>

<p>上項全部借欵除减去一切費用及二十四年三月一日到期已償之本金外净數約爲三八·〇〇〇·〇〇〇元內有三·八四四·〇〇〇元爲繳納海關進口稅及附加稅之用綜計此次借欵連同費用平均估　約合年息百分之八·五左右</p>
<p>至於借欵用途之分配悉依照政府决議原則完全用於生產事業截至二十四年二月二十五日止已經分配者計復興江西匪區農村費三百八十萬元救濟四川災荒費三十萬元整理金融欵項一千五百萬元撥充全國經濟委員會建設事業費一千二百六十萬元其用途係依照上年三月二十六日該會全體會議决議以公路開拓衛生設施及江西與西北之建設爲標的並力圖改進全國絲茶棉曁燃料等各項重要物品以期國內交通實業與國外貿易得以同時推進</p>

<p>數月以前國內金融異常緊張殆有岌岌不可終日之勢該行曾竭盡全力協助各業而市面賴以穩定其後復會同各大銀行集合鉅量基金以維持現有之金融組織自二十三年十月十五日政府開征白銀出口平衡稅後該行復讜力安定匯市收效頗宏其裨益工商業爲力實非淺鮮也</p>
<p>該行於國內各埠多已設有分支行或辦事處最近復在江西福建匪區收復各地以及川貴等省先後籌設分支各行藉以協助復興及剿匪等工作</p>

<p>廢兩改元爲我國幣制上一大改革雖從前銀兩早成虛位而社會積習相沿弊端百出自中央造幣廠成立政府認爲統一法幣之時機已至遂於二十二年三月頒布銀本位幣鑄造條例規定銀本位幣總重二六·六九七一公分銀八八銅一二卽合純銀二三，四九三四四八公分旋復頒發廢兩改元之布告如下「……四月六日起所有公私欵項之收付與訂立契約票據及一切交易須一律改用銀幣不得再用銀兩其在是日以前原訂以銀兩爲收付者在上海應以規元銀七錢一分五釐折合銀幣一元爲標準概以銀幣收付如在上海以外各地方應按四月五日申匯行市先行折合規元再以規元七錢一分五釐折合銀幣一元爲標準概以銀幣收付其在是日以後新立契約票據與公私欵項之收付及一切交易而仍用銀兩者在法律上爲無效至持有銀兩者得依照銀本位幣鑄造條例之規定請求中央造幣廠代鑄銀幣或送交就地中央中國交通三銀行兌換銀幣行使以資便利」</p>
<p>上列布告頒布後一切進行甚爲順利市上所存寶銀已經逐漸吸收改鑄新幣及廠條（註一）二十二年四月廢兩改元開始時上海市所存寶銀及大條約一七三，〇〇〇，〇〇兩（內包括美國大條九七〇四）（註二）約折合本位幣二四二，〇〇〇，〇〇〇元是年十二月十五日經本部訂定分期兌換辦法後各中外行商前往中央銀行登記之寶銀共計爲一四六，二〇二，〇三六，九七兩此項寶銀由中央銀行按月比例攤兌以本位幣一百元折合規元七十一兩五錢計算及二十三年十二月二十七日寶銀總數已减至二七，四〇〇，〇〇〇兩（內包括九八〇美國大條）約折合本位幣三八，〇〇〇，〇〇〇元惟是項低减之數有一部份由於行商運銀出口而不全由於兌換改鑄也</p>
<p>截至二十三年十二月三十一日止中央造幣廠所鑄成之新幣總數爲九九·〇一七·三八二元所鑄廠條總值爲五一·八七五·〇〇〇元最近該廠每月鑄量新幣約八百萬元廠條約值四百萬元依此比例計算則經過數月之後市上之寶銀及美國大條均可次第改鑄完竣現在各省市均已禁止鎔鑄竇銀除中央造幣廠外各處造幣廠亦已通飭停鑄寶銀及雜幣之來源既經杜絕貨幣之統一當可預期</p>
<p>各省從前濫鑄輔幣其成色重量及形式龐雜異常自應亟圖整理以杜流弊現已由部設置幣制研究委員會廣集專家詳密規劃擬俟具體方案完成經部核定後呈准實行又取締私發紙幣辦法已於上年第二次全國財政會議時提出討論各省財政負責人員均能明悉利害深表贊同循此以往當可徐收廓淸之效</p>
<p>二十二年夏倫敦世界經濟會議期內我國代表與奧大利亞加拿大印度墨西哥秘魯西班牙及美國等國代表簽定白銀協定其主要條文規定自二十三年一月一日起限期四年印度政府售銀數量平均每年以三五，〇〇〇，〇〇〇純盎斯爲限每一年以五〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇純盎斯爲限西班牙政府售銀量平均每年以五，〇</p>
<h2>Page 11</h2>
<p>〇〇，〇〇〇純盎斯為限每一年以七，〇〇〇，〇〇〇為限澳大利亞加拿大墨西哥秘魯及美國在此時期內不得出售生銀並依照商定之比例每年在其破產之生銀以內統合購買或設法在市面收回三五〇〇〇，〇〇〇純盎斯至中國政府在此期內不將其由鎔毀銀幣所得之生銀出售此項協定現已經各簽約國之政府一致批准。</p>
<p>上述倫敦協定於其序言內曾聲明協定主旨為求銀價之穩定去年二月我國政府考慮批准銀協定時實熙曾非正式照會美國政府提醒注意波及我國之任何銀價計劃若銀價高至脫離世界物價水准則我國國內通貨勢將收縮出口貿易及對外購買力亦將更形低落同時並提及若銀價過高將使大量銀貨外流而於我國國際收付影響益钜故祥熙甚願美國政府為兼顧兩國利害計對於任何設施足以影響銀價涉及我國幣制及匯市者預為彼此之洽商</p>
<p>二十三年三月二十一日我國政府正式批准白銀協定惟聲明保留如下</p>
<p>「中國政府批准此約聲明因銀幣現為中國本位幣倘遇金銀比價發生變動至中國政府認為足以妨害中國國民經濟而與本協定安定銀價之精神不合時得自由采取適當之行動」去年八月國內銀貨外流形勢頗為嚴重政府複向美方抗議以為美國一九三四年六月十日之購銀法令足以影響銀價及我國之利益其情形與從前大量售銀國促成之流弊相同九月國內金融情一菜更趨緊迫我國駐美公使複照會美方認為我國目前所受通貨收縮之影響經濟上之損失以及國際收付平準之失調其原因實由於自一九三一年起外幣下跌銀價上千而尤以最近數月國銀價更高之故該次照會並請美方保證不再有吸引中國白銀過量流出之行動並與我政府合作依照倫敦銀協定之原旨維持銀價之堅定勿令高漲</p>
<p>美國政府於去年十月十二日複文略稱美國購銀法令係國會議定命令行政機關依照執行惟於執行時所取方法行政機關有便宜之權故甚願於實行該項計劃時除仍依照原定之目標進行外盡量避免對中國之級濟及財政發生擾亂等語</p>
<p>世界金融風潮之緊急既如上述本部為限制幣材外流計迭與金融界領袖縝密討論始決定徴收銀出口平衡稅於十月十五日實行更設立外匯平市委員會其任務為核定每日應徴平衡稅之標準阻止外匯極度漲落該會由中央中國交通等三行代表會同組織之</p>
<p>限制銀出口辦法施行後幣材外溢之憂當可稍舒計二十三年份我國銀貨出口淨數為二五七·〇〇〇·〇〇〇元其中六分之五係在美國購銀法令實施後（至十月十四日止）四個月內輸出之數又查上海存銀數量二十三年六月底止本為五四四·〇〇〇·〇〇〇元迨至十二月二十七日則已減至二一七·〇〇〇·〇〇〇元</p>
<p>國外市場銀價之上漲恒速於我國銀於匯價之變動如去年十月十四日以前國外銀块之值超越國內匯價頗多甚至可抵付一切運輸費用而有餘由七月至十月間滬市掛牌銀元匯價比較倫敦銀市平價共相差短絀之數由百分之四強至百分之九·八強我國幣制幾為全部支援是以政府當機立斷實行開徴平衡稅以資控制</p>
<p>更有進行徴收銀出口稅獨防止存銀外流且可抑制匯價上升蓋匯價如過度高漲至脫離世界物價水准之時則我國之國外貿易勢必極端降落而通貨收縮之惡果更將漫無底止即就現在情形觀之大量存銀出口已足使國內銀根奇緊二十三年下半期內一般行莊拆息原為六厘者漲至二分六厘至有出賣遠期外匯以求現金豐時之周轉者而市面短期借款利息仍有超過年息三分之趨勢</p>
<p>國外貿易情形同時亦是險象二十三年下半年比同年上半年減少百分之十三比上年下半年減少百分之十八，斯時國內債券及一般房地產均下跌百分之十至十五左右工商業則倒閉時聞失業人數亦隨之增加</p>
<p>政府鑒於上述種種困難情形迭經令飾中央中國交通等行隨時按照市上需要情形酌量放款救劑一面並設法獎勵生銀入口藉以稍舒金融市場之疲敝此外凡有裨益工商各界之有效方案政府仍將繼續採用之</p>
<p>注一：中央造幣廠所鑄之廠條每條總重及成色適合銀本位幣一千元原為便利銀錢業同業間收解之用以前曾另鑄有甲種廠條一種成色千分之九九九合銀幣一千元共計鑄成約三·六二一·〇〇〇元現已停鑄統計截至二十三年十二月三十一日止所鑄成廠條之總值為四八·二五四·〇〇〇元</p>
<p>注二：美國大條總重為一·〇〇〇至一·一〇〇兩約值規元一·〇〇〇兩</p>
<p>（十）　預算決算</p>
<p>近年稅收淨數，逐年增加，然收支相抵，不敷之數仍钜，茲將十七年度以來收支情形，表列如左。</p>
<p>附注（一）十七年度支出數內借款欵撥充中央銀行資本金二、〇〇〇、〇〇〇元及退選庚子賠欵均未併入計算</p>
<p>上列一表，有應加以說明者，即二十年度內所列之短絀數目，全屬於上半年度之收支不敷，至下半年度，及二十一年度之上半年度內，為軍政費之極度緊縮，收支差可平衡，並無短絀，其後事變繁興，軍政費再事膨漲，故表列二十一年度及二十二年度內之收支，仍屬不敷。</p>
<p>然爾年度內還債之數目尚能抵付借款之數目，計二十一年度內，還債總數為一萬萬元，二十二年度，為一萬一千五百萬元。</p>
<p>各年度內重要之開支，仍為軍務費及債務費兩項，可於下列一表見之。</p>
<p>軍務費債務費與賠欵</p>
<p>附注（一）二十年度內有四九、〇〇〇、〇〇〇元二十一年度內有五九、〇〇〇、〇〇〇元二十年度內有四六、〇〇〇、〇〇〇元均係以前各年度支出之款</p>
<p>上列軍務費之增加，其原因已於上文分別略述，至債務費及賠款減少之原因，一由於二十一年二月內整理內債之結果，一由於英鎊及美金元跌價，償付外債時，需款較少之故，但二十三年度內，因曾發行數種債券，債務費仍有增加·</p>
<p>以前各年度，國家預算，僅二十年度整個成立，而尚有未盡完備之處，至二十三年度編造國家總概算，為力求完備，計凡屬中央收支，羅列無遺，即向歸各省留用者，亦經查明數目，分別編入，欵目分析亦較精祥，計收支總額各為九萬一千八百餘萬元，而收入方面，各項主稅收均較前略增，其所列彌，歲計不足之借款，僅為五千萬元，支出方面，經臨軍費減至三萬三千二百餘萬，教育文化費，增至三千三百餘萬元，各項經濟建設費及營業投資，增至八千六百餘萬元，質量兩方，均有　著之進步，茲將二十三年度國家普通總概算列表如下。</p>

<p>（十一）　總結</p>
<p>祥熙受任之始深知財政與經濟之關系至為密切故一面節省浮費整頓稅收以濟國用一面培養民生增進稅源以固國本適值世界金融風潮遠來侵　國內天災人禍　起交乘勉力支柱渡過難關實屬萬幸以目前情形觀之就支出言則年來剿匪軍事順利內亂漸平軍費之縮小固可預期行政費亦可再謀撙節就收入言如各省秩序安定經濟狀況恢複常態財務行政繼續改善歲入當可漸增國庫收支之平衡尚非甚難之事以後之眼光應注意於社會經濟之發展政府信用之鞏固以完成國民經濟建設為最後之目標故今後財政上之要務有下列各端</p>
<p>（一）勵行更有效力之預算制度以控制支出</p>
<p>（二）清理衍期債務</p>
<p>（三）整理鹽稅施行劃一稅率撤消附稅改良監質對於生產運輸加以嚴密之管理</p>
<p>（四）整理關稅稅則務求稅收增加而不影響於工業用品及一般民眾日用品對於持種出口物產在可能範圍內減輕或全免出口稅以資鼓勵</p>
<p>（五）繼續設法調整並減輕省市地方稅使與中央稅制收內外相維之效</p>
<p>（六）獎勵並統制國內重要實業如棉紗棉布生絲等類</p>
<p>（七）穩定貨幣並統一輔幣以剷除工商業之障礙</p>
<p>（八）改進交通尤以發展鐵路及公路為最要</p>
<p>（九）救濟立國根之農業並謀農村經濟之發展</p>
<p>上述各端粗崖略然政府與人民是能實力合作次第施行則國民經濟當中漸履坦途國家財政自能趨入正軌惟祥熙個人之私願國家前途實利賴之</p>

<p>中央社云、吳市長為推行新生活運動、促進本市社會建設起見、特提倡訂定一日、為定本市節日、昨市政府紀念週、報告擬上海市節、並製上海市歌之意義、辭頗肯切、原詞如下、各位同志、我今天的報告、就是要向上海市民建議、規定一天為上海市節、並製一上海市市歌、一方面先來說明我的意思、一方面還要徵求全市市民的意見、今年上海市政府努力的方向、已定為社會建設、所以今年是上海市政府的社會建設年、我們一方面要全市公務員來此方向去努力、一方面又要喚起全上海市市民來贊助市政府、與市政府合作、以完成我們社會建設年中所擬進行的各種事業、我們要知道社會建設與其他各種建設不同、其他各種建設、大都偏重物質方面、社會建設則尚須注重精神方面、我們上海市全體公務員與全市市民、在努力本市社會建設的行程中、不要忽略了這重要的一點、就是在消極方面、要轉移風俗、在積極方面、要精神建設、我們在國民革命的過程中、在新中國建設以及中華民族復興運動的進程中、我們要如何設法剷除當前妨礙國民革命、妨礙新中建設、妨礙中華民族復興的一切有形無形的障礙、這個工作、是我們目前最緊要的工作、所謂無形的障礙、比較有形的障礙、力量更大、譬如風俗、他是有歷史背景的、是幾千年相傳下來的、在一般人民的心理、有極大的支配力、但是風俗有許多是善良的、有許多是違背時代精神的、善良風俗、我們當然要保存他、不但要保存他、並且要提倡他發揚他、但是那些違背時代精神有礙社會進步的風俗、我們一定要想法改良他、甚至剷除他、這就是我們在新舊交戰的時候、所必須努力奪鬥的重要工作、因為一時代有一時代的精神與需要、我們中國幾千年相傳下來的風俗、有很多已不合現今時代的精神與需要、這種違背時代精神與需要風俗、卽是阻止社會進步、以及新中國建設的無形障礙、我們自當將他改良或剷除、大家要認識、現在是一個科學萬能的時代、現在是一個人力勝天的時代、我們要發揮人的力量來謀生存、這才合於現代的精神、而我們的風俗、很多與現代精神相違背、最顯著的例子、如求神問卜、迎神賽會、燒肉香、發天餉·等種種無意識的舉動、好像前幾個星期、報載嘉定縣羅店的老百姓發天餉、求神消災降福、前幾星期、嘉興舉行迎神賽會、政府禁止、因而罷市、又好像前幾個禮拜浦東與江灣都舉行迎神賽會、雖今年的情形、因市府事前設法禁止、似較往年稍佳、但是這種無意識的舉動、違背時代精神的風俗、至今還盛行着、還有很大的社會潛勢力、我們一定要以政治的力量來禁止他、來領導人民、向一條很合理的合乎時代精神的路上去走、我們新中國的建設運動、巳有了五十餘年、吾黨總理所領導國民革命、也已有了五十餘年之久、但是到了今日、大多數民衆、還是跟隨着舊的勢力、在舊的思想當中過生活、這種舊的勢力與舊的思想、我們如果不去剷毀他、我們有什麼方法來建設新中國、復興中華民族呢、蔣委員長有鍳及此、深知革命非先革心、變政非先變俗不可、所以要提倡新生活運動、因為生活的方式與社會的進步、最有關係、不良的生活方式、當然衹有造成一個惡劣的社會、這是一定的道理、生活方式如果不能改善、則我們的社會也是不能改善的、因此蔣委員長要提倡新生活運動、要責成各地政府·各地黨部·全國的公務員·全國的國民黨同志、以政治的力量、用勸導的方式、來推行新生活運動、我們欲求國民革命的澈底成功、不能不先改造全國人民的生活、我們要改造人民的生活、又不能不先剷除一切不良的違背時代精神的風俗、所以我們推行新生活運動最切要的工作、就是要轉風易俗但是我們要把積重難返和歷史的成訓最深的中國社會移轉過來、除了利用政治力量以外、還要用社會敎育的方式、來因勢利導、而因勢利導的方法、又莫如寓敎於「樂」、因此我們想由上海市政府來提倡、定一天為上海節、使全市幾百萬老百姓、無論士農工商、男女老幼、無分貧富的、每年個個人都能興高彩烈的共同高興快樂一天、就是所謂民衆娛樂、這一天娛樂的方式、我們要有各種意義寓寄於裏面、如勸農·勸學·勸工·勸商·以及提倡勤儉、使全市市民、在上海節那一天、興高彩烈之中、能啟發他們熱烈的情緒、活潑的精神、以及高尚的意義、健全的思想、從而蔚為一市新的氣象、同時我們還想製定一個上海市市歌、這個歌要很通俗的、使全市市民個個都能唱、內容也要帶着勸農勸工勸學勸商以及提倡勤儉的意識、一以消除都市靡靡之音、一以陶冶市民健全的性情、總之、我們想由這個愉快的節和這個歌、將那些違背時代精神的風俗、逐漸轉移過來、同時、還要籍此來造成一種新的風俗、來振起全市市民的高尚志趣和活潑的精神、這是本市社會建設中之重要工作、這種提倡地方節的辦法、并非創舉、各國各地、都有地方節、所謂Cnrnival、我國各地、也各有他的節、我不過按着時代的精神、環境的需要、加以改良而已、我們在上海講上海、上海的善良風俗、我們固要保存他、要發揚他、然而上海的一切違背時代精神的風俗、我們也要設法加以改良、我們看現在上海市民、一年三百五十六天中、簡直沒有一個共同快樂高興的日子、從前在陰曆年的時候、無論男女老幼貧富甚至負債的人、都是快樂的、現在陰曆已　除、改用新暦、可是新曆現在還不能普及、祇是少數人在行着新曆、大多數人還不知採用、因此在新曆新年的時候、那種興高彩烈的快樂的情緒、當然不能有、而星期休假、還是一種新的制度、除了全國行政機關和少數銀行工廠行這星期休假制度以外、其他各處還未普及、就是普及了、也還是不能使民眾同樂、卽是到了國慶變十節時候、也不見得如何高興快樂、我們看看其他國家的國慶、他們的人民是何等的興高彩烈、歡樂若狂、是如何的普及、而我國的國慶、人民都還漠然視之、當然沒有什麼快樂可言、一則是因為時間太短、且其間又經過了種種的變動、二則因為我們現在國難時期、似無心於慶祝國慶、因此我們在上海說上海、我們全上海的市民、實在找不出可使大家共同快樂的一天、更找不出有意識的娛樂的一天、無怪全市多數市民、天天在那裏愁眉不展、在那裏苦悶煩惱、一方面游惰成性的人、却是天天甚至時時刻刻在作不正當的娛樂、在如此情形之下、我們有什麼方法可將市民熱烈的情緒喚起來呢、又有什麼方法、可使市民的活潑的精神、激勵起來呢、若長此以往、那些迎神賽會、燒肉香等等的怪現象怪風俗、惟有天天存在、日日廣大、這樣非惟妨碍了新中國建設、與中華民族復興的進行、同時民氣也還要一天一天的消沉卜去、消沉到將來不可救藥的地步、前途的危險誠不堪設想、所以我們本着新生活運動的宗旨本着革命先革心的宗旨、並本着轉風移俗的宗旨、我們一定要將上海的善良風俗保存而提倡之、而所有一切違背時代精神的風俗、則我們一定要分別輕重緩急、一步一步地轉移他轉移的方法、就是要「寓敎於樂」、領導全市市民作共同的娛樂、規定一個上海節、使全市民、在這一天內、無論男女老幼貧富、大家都來共同娛樂、在娛樂之中、提倡勸農·勸工·勸學·勸商、以及動儉和讀書等精神、使娛樂成為有意義的娛樂、使娛樂民衆化、社會化、敎育化、同時我們還要製上海市市歌、給全上海市市民歌唱、使彌漫都市的靡靡之音、改換過來、使全市市民熟烈的情緒、煥發起來、使消沉苦悶的社會、一變而為活潑快樂的社會、一個都市充滿着這樣熱烈快樂的情緒、才可繁榮發達、推而廣之、如果一個民族充滿着這樣熱烈快樂的情緒、才可改造因循頹廢的國民性、才可發展社會的活動力、增益國民的同情心、這樣自然會有復興的希望云云、</p>

<p>— （顏波光）</p>
<p>去年秋收，因受旱災影響，農田泰半顆粒無收。今春饑民載道，嗷待哺，更有生育繁衍之家，兒女成行，饑餓更厲，不得巳惟有出賣兒女，免成餓殍。茲據調查所得，女子卻比男兒好賣、面目姣好者，尤受買主歡迎。此種女子皆大都市中買去，教歌學舞，不數年，恐又錄芒畢露，或成明星歟。可見女子畢竟比男兒值價。</p>
<p>天氣漸漸的熱起來，人們身上的衣衫也漸漸的單薄了，尤其是娘兒們，早換上了時代的新裝。在上海繁榮的南京路上，儘可見到許多肉感的女子—裸腿，露臂—一般色情狂的男子，誰不歌頌一聲—妙妙—呢？可是在農村裏，也有很健的少婦，跣着雙跌，裸着大腿，捲起衣袖，在田間帮同男子揷秧。又有誰去注意伊們呢？</p>
<h3 id="c185">楊花小語 <a href="#c185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>— 秋子</p>
<p>楊花是怪討厭的東西！楊柳花飛，平白地捲將容去，好一幅雜花生樹羣鶯亂飛的江南麗景，盡被它糟塌得不成樣子。</p>
<p>本來楊花一物，賦性輕浮，秉質纖弱，隨風飄蕩，完全不由自主。有時落在人家書籍上就會變做蛀虫，把書籍咬壞：若是落到靑草池塘裏，也就變做了浮萍，隨波　流值此楊花時節，呢絨皮　，是　萬嗮不得的。所以古人形容輕浮婦女，呌做『水性楊花』，簡直是再恰　也沒有了。</p>
<p>至於『楊花蘿蔔』，是說那小小的又紅又圓的蘿蔔，要在有楊花的時候才有，過了當然沒得了。楊花蘿蔔，羅蔔楊花，　則同來，去則同去，姊妹花呢？難兄弟呢？</p>
<p>古之人有寫寫意意，『閑看兒童捉　花』，大過共有閑階級之生活者矣，又有看見『點點楊花入硯池』，便感到春光不可久留，而埋頭大讀其周易者矣，今者，顚狂柳絮又隨風舞矣，這明明昭示吾們說，『九十春光，又將歸去』。朋友們！從此興奮呢？嘸啥關係呢？</p>
<h3 id="c186">包車 <a href="#c186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>— 顏</p>
<p>在上海地方，坐一輛包車，算不得什麼闊，因爲自有坐汽車朋友壓住他。然而在內地的城市裏，街道狹窄，汽車無用武之地，坐包車的却是惟我、獨尊，威風凛凛了，包車雖遠是上海那樣的包車，可是他們在路上發出呌人讓避之聲，其先聲奪人，猶爲上海汽車所不及。它那揚聲器有兩個，一作咕咕之聲，一作叮叮噹噹之音：咕咕之聲宏壯如獅吼，叮噹之音淸越像金石爭嗚，有時咕咕，有時叮噹，有時咕咕叮噹，相間而奏，眞是氣槪威嚴，足令萬人辟易。安閒地右腿擱在左腿上而斜臥其體在車中，通衢往來，左右顧盼，好不驕傲煞人也麼哥！羨慕煞人也麼哥！</p>
<p>常熟的包車，尤較各地爲闊，他們除有各地包車之所長外，特別還有它晚上的威光。他們的包車，裝置了雪亮的竄燈，少則左右兩燈，多則連後共四燈，和上海紅倌人坐了上差的包車相較，其精美明亮，有過之無不及。一車當街，中坐着公子哥兒，雪樣的光，玉樣的臉，互相輝映，雖不能博得擲果盈車，然而萬人注目，尤其贏得美人之靑睞，亦足自豪矣。車旣這樣精美眩人，車夫自也不能不使之一身整潔，與車相稱。所以車夫也多衣裳楚楚，夏葛冬裘。祁寒時季，車夫奔走時，必把長裘之兩下角提起塞在腰帶下，名爲便於奔跑，實則是故意露其雪白之裘，表示他的豪闊。車夫固足以示其闊，而車中人更覺御此車夫，闊而又闊了。</p>
<p>讀者疑吾言乎？則無錫常熟等地固多佳山水，乘此春光明媚，不妨前去遊覽，而順便賞鑑他們的包車。</p>

<p>浴佛節：人，男男女女，老老少少，掛着黃布袋的善男信女，呼東喚西的攤販們，香烟，燭光，紙錠屑，……這些交織成的一年一度的盛會，雖然是年年都有這番熱鬧，可是，人依然那麼一大堆一大堆］擁進這靜安寺裏去。</p>
<p>信徒們從袋裏摸出雪亮的銀洋角子，在廟門前換了綫香，紅燭，紙錠，走進廟裏去，只是一匐伏的辰光，紙錠化成了灰，綫香和紅燭早給廟祝移去了，信徒們面上浮着絲絲的微笑，又被擠在人業裏。等跨出廟的側門，一位基督信徒授給他一張「不要信奉木偶」的傳單，他把眼一斜，急急地把那張反動的標語狠命地往地上一擲，嘴裏似乎在說：「觸霉頭—觸到印度國！」</p>
<p>寺前有口方井，信徒們有的在寺裏買了烏龜到井裏去放生，但是井水很淺，小販常常等信徒走遠了，仍把那烏龜捉了起來去賣給第二個人，這循環的而又滑稽的放生術，只有在都市巾才會發現的。</p>
<p>寺的周圍，是擠滿着攤基，桌椅，籐器，左面空地上是許多玩意兒的集團：西洋鏡，糖攤，轉盤……各式各樣賺錢的生意眼　市面不景氣，看的人比買的人多，攤販們在大雨淋漓的下面，更皺緊着眉頭了。</p>

<p>他就向二人微笑着道：我大槪在此地不久了，將來回到了江南，第一件事，我就是　此地的困苦情形，向江南人去報告，我不敢說和西北人帮多少忙，至少可以阻止請多鑽官蟲向這裏跑了，所以我願意多得一點報告。程志前笑道：你這話可是小西天的主人翁所不願意聽的。到西北來求官的人，十停有五六停人，是住在大西天的。你攔阻他們不來，這裏裏的生意要大爲减色了。他帶說着話，帶走出了房門，周有容還是戀戀不捨，直跟送到後院子裏來，方始回去。程志前因爲只管和周有容說話，走着路是很緩，就落後了幾步，王北海他太年輕，不知道什麼考量，忽忽的就向程志前屋子裏鑽了進去。他逕直的向裏衝，却不曾理會到眼前，因之當面有人，也不會看到　只覺胸前碰，人幾乎是向後面倒栽出來。趕快手扶門框站定。正是那朱月英姑娘。低了頭向外走，這一腦袋，不偏不斜，撞在北海的胸前。他退後了兩步，向着北海看了一下，然後微鞠着躬。紅了臉，有一句話，想說了出來。可是看到北海身後，還是有人跟着的，他那到了口邊上的兩句話，因之復又忍耐住了。程志前看得淸楚，早就搶上前一步，走進房來了。看看月英之後，才笑道：怎麼樣？你還沒有走嗎？月英手扶了棹子角，低　站住答道：我把程老爺屋子裏弄得　死了，怎敢隨便走開？（二〇三）</p>

<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>這聲高喊之後便馬上起了一陣很大的騷動，狗房裏一面的那些狗，多很快的奔出來了。汪……汪……汪……的亂呌起來，同時還沒命的搖着，它們那一截短短的尾巴，顯然是表示它們在迎接太后的意思。太后見了，不由笑逐臉開，比受了伊的大臣們的參拜更高興。這一軍的中間，太后所最寵愛的那一頭名喚海龍的，—也就是後來隨着我們上奉天去的那一頭—也在共內；這一次，我就初次的認識了它的特長。它見了我們，便把身子直立起來，縮着前腿，做着像作揖的樣子。它的意思彷彿是說。</p>
<p>「瞧啊！這裏還有誰能怎樣的靈巧啊？我要沒有這樣特殊的本領，使別的狗相形見拙，太后怎樣會特別的寵愛我呢」？</p>
<p>不過它這樣直立起來的架子，也不能裝得怎樣久，大約祗裝了四五分鐘模樣，便依舊撲了下來；依我想，多分是那樣的直立，確是很慶力的，所以那畜生不能持久了。</p>
<p>我們漸漸地已走得逼近了那些狗房，於是那一個正輸在班上承值的太監便開始將已走出屋的狗檢默起來，見有落在後面還不曾驚覺的，便再大聲的呼喝；這樣，它們也就一起奔出來了。（三一三）</p>

<p>在下有兩位甲乙朋友：一個是性急的，一個是性慢的。現在把他們的趣事，分列在下面，以博一笑。</p>
<p>甲很喜飲酒：一天，他走過一家酒店，他本來是老主顧。就呌店夥燙了一壼酒，自己提了回去。跑到家裏，他妻子見丈夫提了酒壼回來。便備了杯筷，要代他斟酒。可是酒壺拿在手裏，是空空的。驚問道，咦！怎麼這壼是空得沒有酒的？甲道：我因酒香撲上鼻管來，一時酒癮來了，等不及到家裏。所以，路走，一路喝，跑到了，酒才喝完咧。</p>
<p>乙性很緩：他定了幾份大小報都要在夜裏看的。每張都細細的閱着，不肯遺漏。這樣，他只好將各報，排日細閱。一晚，他拿了一張中報附刋在看。恰有一個朋友跑來，問道：今天報上，可有什麼新開？乙慢慢的道：新閉也許是有的。不過我看報，是要排好日子的。現在所看的報，還是星期之前的。今天的報，還沒有輸着咧。</p>

<p>— 枕綠</p>
<p>「前主人張先生台鑒愚僕高志方拜見現在警界新閘分局服務』</p>
<p>上月裏一天早上，小僮忽然進房喚醒了我，交給我這個墨筆字條，說有一個像警察模樣的人要見我，寫下這字；他說多年不見老東家了，今天特來問候，並將報告一番他的經過；他還呼得出我幾個孩子的名字呢。我瞧那字跡很不高明，也很生分。我詢問過這人的相貌身材口音等後，在過去吃過我飯的上百個人內縣揣，總想不出是誰。大女兒出去偷瞧一下，疾忙回進很興奮地告訴我：「是包車夫阿根呀！眞的，穿了警察的制服，挺新的，抖咧』！於是我敎小僮去約他改日在上午的時候來，可以多談一回。</p>
<p>這高志方是江北人，他服役我處已在六七年前；那時有人知道他的家設定在南市薛家洪一帶，沿黃浦灘搭着高架的破船裏，那處原是一衆江北同鄉的居留地，都把和他同樣的旱船爲家的。他當一名包車夫，先在拉我一家遠親—一個很會賺錢的商人的包車。可是，他嫌這東家太傖俗了，脾氣合不來，倒不在乎靠他容易賺幾個錢。他識得字，一得空閒便取起書報來看，有時還出聲誦讀，居然給人稱爲書獃子，也爲他的主人所不喜，嗔他似乎存心和主人比資格呢。他也一心一意託我一位長親，蘆他到我家來；他的主意，因爲張先生是文人，他願投一個斯文的主子。不久，他果得如願來我處供役了，得空可以任意閱讀現成約警報。這樣，過了一年光景，他因事回鄉，一時不得出來，纔歇了非處的生意。此後，我們沒聽到他的消息，直至最近。</p>
<p>果然，過了幾大，這位前包軍去阿根，現任警務人員高志方，應約又來了。他見了我立刻立正，行舉手禮，使找有些感到不安：他呢，還守着從前主僕的名分，只是站着講話。我聽到了他過去的大略。</p>
<p>那時，他從本鄉重到上海，便改拉黃包車度日，那境况自比拉包軍更差些；幸虧他是內行，跑路又快，又年靑—有過一十一二歲，尚能敷衍生計。</p>

<h3 id="c209">論通俗文 <a href="#c209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>— 夏時</p>
<p>現在，是『通俗』的時代。</p>
<p>但一般人對於「通俗」這個詞，似乎還保存着傳統的觀念，常常有種誤解。比如，拿文學來說吧。一提到通俗文學，就以爲是迎合低級趣味的東西，和學者名流的純文學不同，甚至是對立的。這就是跟漢書藝文志把小說看做「街頭巷語道聽塗說之所造」是同樣的看法。</p>
<p>其實，現在的所謂『通俗』，不應該是這樣的意思。它不是低級趣味的迎合，而是一般讀者趣味的提高。通俗文學跟純文學成爲對立的兩個名詞，原是文學到了被少數人竊持的時候才有的，那些少數文學者，爲要眩耀自己的高深，爲要證明一般人是不配接近文學，於是把那些出自一般人或迎合一般人趣味的作品呌做通俗文學，表示不能歸入文學的正統。然而，一般人生活的向上發展，終於啟發了要求文學的自覺。他們不滿足於低級趣味，他們要衝破那種人爲的障礙踏入「藝術之宮」。那末，由這而產生的通俗文學運動，顯然就跟以前的看法不同，不是另立門戶，而在根本使文學或爲普遍的東西。不然的話，我們爲什麼不呌張恨水不肯生等是通俗文學作家呢？爲什麼不把啼笑因緣江湖奇俠傳認做通俗文學作品呢？</p>
<p>通俗，是指內容和形式兩方面而說的。單在形式上兜圈子，不能算作通俗，離開形式而談內容也不能算作通俗。江湖奇俠傳，在文字上是比較淺顯的，但因爲它所表現的，是一種低級趣味；所以我們不能認它是通俗文學作品。低級趣味和高級趣味的區別，就在低級趣味，是陳腐的沒有生活內容或與生活內容不調和的趣味，高級趣味是從實生活感受到的或者能够加强生活力的趣味。</p>
<p>『通俗』，在內容上，應該要有普遍性，要有積極性，在形式上。應該要簡明要輕快。通俗文學的目的，就在使一般人接受文學這一份產業。所以通俗文學運動，不能單從通俗方面去看，要看做整個文學發展的轉樞。</p>

<p>向南移徙了一千多里，氣候是熱了些，感覺還辨別不出，樹木和小麥却標誌得明明白白。</p>

<p>家鄉在靑靑的天下，葱蘢的平原上，是不通水路的。</p>
<p>這樣的天地間，汽車是唯一的英雄。車額橫一塊牌子：「開往東周」，不曉得是什麼意思。磅過行李，城門上一番盤查，放行了。好像很威風。但在越過鐵路不久，這英雄碰了一個釘子，是一頭抵在橋下的。</p>
<p>『下來，下來……』一個年靑的司機推開車門。</p>
<p>於是大家下來。</p>
<p>『唉，怎麼了的？』</p>
<p>中年婦人從車窗探出半個頭。別人也都不理她。</p>
<p>車輸不知怎的，有一隻自行落水，洗操去了。</p>
<p>於是修理。火油箱，鉗子，旋轉器都搬出來。鄉下人持着飯碗，村童將嘴巴塞得賬着，圍上來，好像觀一匹倒斃在路傍的畜牲。</p>
<p>駕駛人鼓着眼，豎起食指在空中搖着，罵道：</p>
<p>『下三兒孫，滾罷！』</p>
<p>鄕下人互相望着，默然散開去，因爲汽車公司是官辦，車輪又投水了，這不大好惹。</p>
<p>旅行中，我們往往遇見不快的快事，就是辱駡和毆打。人大槪並不像唱的那樣愛好和平，在一直不變的情况下生活着，生理上卽有一種不快，憂鬱或是困頓。有人起了交涉，自然樂得看一看，好在同自己無什麼夾纏。汗毛也不許拔掉一根的。然而，不成，車中或船上，擺拳踢腿，不免受到影響；聽別人吵駡，耳根也難得淸靜。行客常常希望有什麼不平常的事端發生，而又以不防礙自已爲限。</p>
<p>還好，人重又爬進長方形的盒子。共十三個，倒有五名是「咱的人」，不打票。</p>
<p>「眼都要哭瞎了哩，開快。又要馬兒好，又要馬兒不吃草…你的樂子！」</p>
<p>郵差打京話。他有一顆孩童般圓圓的腦袋，豐滿的臉上浮起一抹天眞的笑容。</p>
<p>另一個流氓似的年靑伙伴，不知何故將臉牽得斜着，兩個指頭敲着膝蓋說</p>
<p>「你呢：抱着大腿。」</p>
<p>駕駛人將上體向前一傾，英雄又發氣的抖着，嗚，嗚，嗚！於是大家搖擺起來。郵差多肉的唇下，拖着閃閃的垂液，打起鼾來了。</p>
<p>一路間，爆竹似的吒罵着牛車。</p>
<p>車滿兜着風，盈溢四濺，在淼茫的原上撒野，馳騁於嫩綠欲滴的毡上。</p>
<p>白楊，翠柳，村落，豐饒的原，向後滑行。綠的，綠的，綠的浩瀚的海。抖的一閃，火一般的桃，烟霧似的棠梨，鵝黃的菜田……滑行着。一個顚擺，嬌滴滴的蔭影罩下來……斑駁陸離的布片，張着風，拂拂的倏跳。村孃絞着手，在笑語，笑聲在綠色裏激蕩……噹咚！桶卸下井中去了。雞嫻雅的呌，從路中吃驚的穩進麥田。猪仔擺弄着耳朶，蹣跚的走向池塘。消失了。白楊，翠柳，村落，豐饒的原……</p>
<p>……城樓坍掉了瓦，壁上有一丈大的白色的字：「國貨門」。旅程自然就此告一段落了。</p>

<p>— 子愷</p>
<p>我每次到上海，一貨些糖菓回來分給兒童，藉添家庭的樂趣。兒童們切望我回家的目的，大半就在這「好東西」上。你向來也是這「好東西」的切望者之一人。你曾經和弟妹們賭賽誰是最後吃完；你曾經把五色金銀的錫紙積受起來製成華麗的手工品，使弟妹們艷羨。這會你怎麼一想，肯把自已的一包藏起來，如數分給弟妹們吃呢？我看見你爲他們分均勻了之後，表示非常的歡喜，同從前賭得了最後吃完時一樣，不覺倚在樓窗上獨笑起來。因爲我憶起了你小時候的事：十來年之前，你是我家的一個搗亂份子，每天爲了要求的不滿足而哭幾塲，挨母親打幾頓。你吃蛋只要吃蛋黃，不要蛋白，母親偶然夾一筷蛋白在你的飯碗裏，你便把飯粒和蛋白亂撥在桌子上，同時大喊「要黃！要黃！」你以爲凡物較好者就呌做「黃」。所以有一次要小椅子玩要，母親搬一個小櫈子給你，你也大喊一要黃！要黃！」你看不起那時候兩歲而還只一不會活動的軟軟。吃東西時，杷不好的東西留着給軟軟吃；講故事時，把不幸的角色派給軟軟當。向母親有所要求而不得允許的時候，你就高聲地問：一當錯軟軟麼？當錯軟軟麼？一你的意思以爲：軟軟這個人要不得，其要求可以不允許；而阿寶是一個重要不過的人，其要求豈有不允許之理？今所以不允許者，大概是當錯了軟軟的綠故。所以每次高聲地提醒你母親，務要她認明阿寶正身，尤許一切要求而後已。這個一味「要黃」而專門欺侮弱小的搗亂分子，今天在那裏犧牲自己的幸福來增殖弟妹們的幸福，使我看了覺得可笑，又覺得可悲。你往日的一切雄心和夢想已經宣告失敗，開始在退制自己的要求，忍耐自已的欲望，而謀他人的幸福了；你已將走出惟我獨尊的黃金時代，開始在嘗人類之愛的辛味了。</p>
<p>記得去年有一天，我爲了必要的事，將離家遠行。在以前，每逢我要出門了，你們一定不高興，要阻住我，或者約我早歸。在更早的以前，我出門須得瞞過你們。你弟弟後來尋我不着，須得哭幾塲。我回來了，倘預知時期，你們常到門口或半路上來迎候。我所描的那幅題曰「爸爸鯊不來」的畫，便是以你和你的弟弟的等我歸家爲題材的。囚爲我在過去的十來年中，以你們爲我的生活的慰安者，天天晚上和你們一起談故事，作游戲，吃東西，使你們都覺得家庭生活的溫暖，少不來一個爸爸，所以不肯放我離家。去年這一天我要出鬥了，你的弟妹們照舊爲我惜別，約我早歸。我以爲你也如此，正在約你何日回家和買些甚麼東西來，不意你却勸我早去，又勸我遲歸，說你有種種玩意可以騙住弟妹們的阻止和盼待。原來你已在我和你母親談話中聞知了我此行有早去遲歸的必要，决意爲我分祖生活的辛苦了。我此行感覺輕快，但又感覺悲哀。因爲我家將少却了一個黃金時代的幸福兒。</p>
<p>以上原都是過去的事，但是常常印在我的心頭，使我不能忘却。現在，你已做中學生，不久就要出黃金時代而走向成人的世間去了。我覺得你此行比出嫁更重大。古人送女兒出嫁詩云：「幼爲長所育，兩別泣不休。對此結中腸，義往難復留」。你出黃金時代的「義往」，實比出嫁更「難復留」，我對此安得不「結中腸」？所以現在追述我的所感，寫這篇文章來送你。你此後的去處，就是我這冊畫集里所描寫的世間。我對於你此行很不放心。因爲遭好比把你從慈愛的父母身邊遺嫁到惡姑的家裏去，正如前詩中所說：「自小關內訓，事姑貽我憂。」事姑取甚樣的態度，我難於代你决定。但希望你努力自愛，勿貽我愛而已。</p>
<p>約十年前，我曾作一冊描寫你們的黃金時代的書集。（子愷書集）。其序文（給我的孩子們）中曾經有這樣的話：「我的孩子們！我憧憬於你們的牛活，每天不止一次！我想委曲地說出來，使你們自己曉得。可惜到你們懂得我的話的時候，你們將不復是可以使我憧憬的人了。這是何等可悲哀的事啊！「但是你們的黃金時代有限，現實終於要暴露的。這是我經騐過來的情形，也是大人們誰也經騐過來的情形。我眼看見兒時的伴侶中的英雄，好漢，一個個退縮，順從，妥協，屈服起來，到像綿羊的地步。我自己也是如此。後之視今，亦猶今之視昔，你們不久也要走這條路呢！」寫遺此話時的情景還歷歷在目，而現在你果然已經「懂得我的話」了，果然也要「走這條路」了！無常迅速，念此又安得不結中勝啊！（完）</p>

<p>— 卷葹</p>
<p>又是下了一整天雨。</p>
<p>坐在屋內，沒有一些事情好做，除了看書之外，便只能傾聽那由遠而近而終於沛然淋漓下來的雨聲，當這聲音蜿蜒地爬進這寂寞的屋子中的時候，當牠爬近我身邊而引得我抬起頭來的時候，窗上便緊緊纏住一幅非常憂鬱，非常慘淡的景象，灰的雲非常無聊的樣子把一切緊緊遮住，大的雨點便零亂地投送到本是黯淡的玻璃上來。可是尤其凄凉的是那雨中的汽笛，是光銳的，哀厲的汽笛，從泊在對面小河的汽船中傳出，本是作爲行駛之信號的，却沒想到給另一些不相干的人帶來一種難以抑制的悲感。一聲響過之後，接着再那麼來上一聲，雨的微塵還是朝玻璃窗上撒來；薄寒中看到兩個瑟縮的雀子冲天飛去，一切是那麼缺乏一個春天的明潔，日午的光輝，於是人便顯得格外憂鬱了。</p>
<p>小小的屋子，在陰雲開始瀰漫的時候，便己燃上了燈，一方爲還沒完全退去的白畫微光所侵襲，遂糅和成一種非常黯淡而又非常迷人的景象。呆然無語的傢俱，在平日這個時候，應當早爲太陽的金光所鍍滿，而坐在那上面的人，應當也有和天氣一樣晴朗的心情，悠然地在微笑着了。但，現在代替日光的只有燈光，牠用一雙富有魅力的手指輕輕撫摩到這屋子的每個角落，是柔和，但也是無力，再加上那滿架的圖書，凌亂的包裏，堊白的墻壁，便醒造出非常纏綿的情調。</p>
<p>手裏拿的是一本柴霍甫的戲劇，以倦怠的目光從那字裏行間捕捉着這人的智慧，當他把什麼蘊在心頭的話都傾吐出來時我遂有惘然自失那樣奇怪的感覺。書裏叙述的，是個靑春巳經消逝的人，在他把一生都消磨於愚蠢的努力之後，突然有些艱愛的火星吹熾在他的心底。</p>
<p>因而做着絕望的非分的企求，最後什麼夢想都泡樣地消滅了，生活的絃經了現實而懶懶鬆弛下來。他想自己還是要活下去的，於是再用麻木與無聊來打發一些以後日子。拿着那本沉重的書，我想像這中年人還要在那古老的庭園裏，荒凉的屋子裏度上二十年或三十年，然後毫不抗拒地死去，有一些熱的淚像春雨那樣轉動在我眼眶裏了。</p>
<p>人們不能有理想，有憧憬，那些只是有閑人們的游戲，在年紀輕的時候，也許會做着好夢，做着那圓圓的，如春月般的好夢。做着夢的人永遠是幸福的，隔絕了外界的一切，把精神游移於幻想的蜃樓中，當然這種好夢可以延長十幾年，或是二十年，因爲對於人類這可憐的生物，是應當有一個短短的時期來享受這悲愴的恩惠的。於是他這樣過着，這種幻境漸漸離他而去，如一個永訣的友人，或許漸漸走遠，或許是突然無踪，可是這都一樣。於是這時期在他是結束了，起初應當是掙扎着，但那也是多麼無力的，可憐的掙扎！慢慢便放下手來，靜候命運把他嵌進一個千篇一律的定型裏面，到後來他死了，他那凝視過人生許多面的眼睛閉了下來，他再不掙扎，他安靜了，到那時候，如果死並沒有把他弄得昏迷的話，他心裏或許會引起一個感覺，固然不必人人相同，可是多少也不能十分兩樣，那就是：「我已經生活過了，原不知一生是如此平淡呢！」</p>
<p>環在我的身後，左右，全是這樣灰色幽靈的灰色影子，全是可憫的，無助的，絨默着的一羣，我不能忍受了，什麼時候，能够打開窗戶，沐浴些金黃色的晴光呢，雨點只是不斷地灑下來，灑下來，雨點把我的希望壓扁了。</p>
<p>此人徒有衣冠，只能威嚇鳥雀。</p>
<h3 id="c213">雨（三） <a href="#c213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>— 何爲</p>
<p>雲霧遮住了他的視綫，鎖住了他的心。他的思想彷彿浮蕩在半空，給風吹得零零碎碎的，飄飄忽忽的，不落一點邊際。他感到寒冷和飢餓。整個上午等過去了，整個下午也等過去了，夜色已經瀰漫了整個大地，可是舅父他們還是沒有影踪。</p>
<p>娟子家里的大門緊閉着，自從舅父進去以後，就沒有開過。村子在風雨中沉睡着，只有鷄聲和狗呌。雨老是不停，簌簌簌簌地，眞呌人難受。在看到炊烟從那村子的屋頂上飄起，漸漸地混入雲霧深處的時候，天籬實在不能孤零零地再在凉亭里呆下去了。他看着那座重鬥深鎖的房子，眞是又氣又恨，恨不得一脚路進那個高牆里面的院子中去，不管老太婆怎樣，抱起娟子就走。</p>
<p>他沿着嶺慢慢地走，從傘子底下伸出頭去，望着前面。嶺雖則是用石塊砌成，但年久失修，到處有泥潭水窪，非常難走。他記得以前在年輕時，也曾跟娟子並肩走過這條短嶺。他們戴着同一把傘子，挨得緊緊的。她有時走得很快，搶着雨傘一個子的往前跑，害得他趕着追，淋滿了一身子的雨；有時却又走得很沒，要他像舊戲劇中的旦角裝小脚似地跟住她走。她的脾氣是無常的，往往會得無故站住不肯走，硬得彷彿給凍住的石塊，非得說了很多低聲下氣的好話。一忽兒她會唱歌，聽着她自己的歌聲，和着山谷的回音；一忽兒她又流淚，看着自己的眼淚混人細雨。所以雖則只是經過一段短短的矮嶺，這小姑娘給他的愛嬌和甜蜜，却已婉轉得儘够消受。</p>
<p>「什麼時候才能再跟娟子一塊　起呢？」</p>

<p>律師負保障人權的使命，故人民生命財產，無端受侵害時，律師得根據法律，向法庭請求救濟，故他們的權威，何等偉大，責任，何等重要，地位，何等優越，故他們對於法律上的智識，自然預備得非常充足，如偽造文書詐斯取財等罪，應該依據法律第幾百幾十條處罪，必定是如數家珍，不意近有兩位法政高材生，而發生共同偽造文書，詐欺取材等事，去實地嘗試身蹈法網的滋味，殊堪詫異。</p>
<p>據報上所載載法政大學畢業生袁海光，因須至司法行政部請領律師證書，缺乏資財，乃興同學江元齡商量，終無法想，乃以法政同學會具名之新華銀行支票兩張，向英商文儀洋行，騙購打字機一架，押洋八十八元，分贓化用，這眞是異想天開，斯文掃地，倒盡大學生的霉。</p>
<p>若照事實來講，該兩大學生，旣有能力讀書，讀書而至法大畢業，現在功虧一簣，何至連一二百元的請領律師證書費，都無法可想，卽使自已沒有，或向稍微富裕些親友處借貸，此種極正當的用途，在親友未必絕對的不肯通融，卽使再無辦法，亦只有俟機而動，或再從別種生產上想法，亦何至迫不及待，而竟出此騙詐行爲，並且此事發生的動機，是要去請領律師證書，聞司法行政部請領律師證書，須費二百餘元，試問僅騙八十餘元，亦仍無濟於事，而且八十餘元，又是分贓分用，則請領律師證書之說，亦有疑問。</p>
<p>至於窮，乃現在中華民國人民的通病，不窮不成爲現在良好的國民，但是窮要窮得淸潔，窮得乾脆，總不要人窮志短，不要倒行逆施，仍須在大路上與社會環境，積極奮鬥，繼續努力，方有生路，至於偽造文書，詐欺取財等事，明明是自投法網，自毀人格，所謂門背後撒污，不圖天亮，結果終有水落石出的一天。</p>
<p>試想江某以法政同學會的支票，向文儀洋行騙購打字機一架，在某一時期，文儀洋行雖可瞞過，但該洋行必定要向浙江實業銀行領取現欵，旣係偽造，印鑑自然不符，浙江實業銀行必然不肯付現，該洋行領不到現欵，自必要根究來源，江袁兩生，到底無所逃罪，這種淺顯的事實，排在眼前，而該兩生竟絕不知覺，尚自幸其計之得售，亦眞可笑極矣，此種行爲，雖中小學生，亦不肯爲，也不願爲，而不意大學生，而且是法政大學生而竟出此，我不禁爲大學生前途悲。</p>

<p>— 拓人</p>
<p>在幾年前，這座蒼老了的P縣還是保存着千百年前的形態，一切都是古老的沒有變過新的花樣。近代文明在這裏沒有它的影子，科學的進展，也沒有侵入到這裏而留下一些痕跡，一切在世界上，在都市中已經是飛躍騰達的事業，在這座古老的城廊中，還是一點的火花也沒有殘存在這裏的只是永久沒有變過的面容，人，是那末像過着中古時代的生活着，事物以及一切的現象，都還是中古時代的特色，一切都好像在死水中生存着。</p>
<p>但是，自從幾年前一條公路從這裏築過之後，這座古老了的城廊，也因此而有了變化了，從那條公路上，帶來了一切新鮮的，居留在這城裏的人們從來未有見過的新的事物。他們感到驚異又感到新奇，誰都好似不相信自己的眼睛般的去注視着一切在他們認爲是奇怪的，新鮮的，變想不到的東西，他們更在幻想着的揣度外面的世界是如何的美麗了。當着從來在這蒼老的城裏的人們幻想都不能够出現的汽車從公路上第一次走過這裏的時候，誰也感到一種特異的奇怪，小孩子們是成羣的圍住着車的週圍在探出着驚奇的眼睛觀望，老年人更是彼此的慨嘆起來，他們都是說：</p>
<p>「天地眞在變了，什麼新奇的東西都會出現，像這樣不用牛馬，也不用人的車，眞是夢也夢不到會有的。孔明用了多少心　才能造木馬木車，現在的人，眞比孔明還聰明了」。</p>
<p>漸漸地，從那他們認爲驚奇的車載運來了一切外面的事物。吃的，穿的，用的，是無窮盡的侵入到這座從千百年前到現在還沒有變過樣的城裏，人們的生活，也給那外來的新事物吸引着而在</p>
<p>新的事物是代替了舊的，蒼老了的P縣已有了一點燃着的新生的火焰了。然而古舊的束西的破滅却給了他們一個可怕的幻影，靠着平工業而過着中古時代的生活的這座城廊，一切都在走着破產的路了。</p>
<p>在幾年前他們還認爲是新鮮的事物，他們在極力的歌頌的新的時代，幾年來雖洗刷去了他們的蒼老的心，雖發展到了己是代替了一切的地步，但他們却起了恐怖，他們的一切，他們的生活的養料，都給那在公路上奔馳着的汽車帶走了。於是他們感到了悲哀，對着新的事物起了仇恨的念頭了。</p>
<p>可怖的幻影，像黑夜的森林般的昏暗，它籠罩着這已經是變了樣的城廓的每一個角落，浸淫着每一個生活在這裏的人們的深心。他們起初的羨慕的，警奇的，祈望的，快樂的一切的思念都給恐怖的幻影蒙住了，而重新佔有着他們現在的心思的恰恰己經是相反了。從新浮在出在他們的腦際的是那己經死滅了的生活的復活，那蒼老的城廓，古舊的事物的再現。是的，那些已是在他們認爲不滿足的了，然而那還是好的，那些還比現在的新的能够增加他們的生活的火燄的。於是小孩子們再不去圍看那奇怪的在公路上奔馳的怪物，老年人也不那末驚怪，他們又是慨嘆起來了，這慨嘆是蒙着一層灰色的了，他們說着：</p>
<p>「新的給我們的思惠是死亡，我們一切生命的火已是熄滅了。」</p>
<p>哙！趁得去。</p>

<h3 id="c216">陋巷 <a href="#c216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>— 雅非</p>
<p>十年前，我曾經住過這條巷子裏的，現在想不到巴然會來舊地重臨；然而眼前的巷子已不像十年以前那個樣子了</p>
<p>記得我們住在這兒的時候，外面那個更樓也還好好的；底下還有一個飄泊老人棲宿着。那條巷子裏除了我們的房子是巍然獨存外，還有幾家都已成了敗垣頹頹壁，而且有幾家的墻圈裏已經改了菜園或菓園了。不過，在我們對門的一家壞落御史第中，却還住着一名本街的更夫，那是一位山束老鄉；他已是四十來了，可還沒有一個老婆過，據他自己說，他的父親便是這御史第里的管門者。</p>
<p>這座堂堂的御史第，在當年我想像它是十分顯赫的。不要說別的，單是那個更樓就够威風了，那麼古色古香的建築，在現代恐怕是很少見得到的吧！巷底用整塊的細砂條舖着，在街上巷門口的一段却舖出了一隻「必尼勝」，御史第的門前也用天台石徘成了一副很精緻的平陞三級」，在門樓上也砌了一個「鯉魚跳龍門」，門的左右兩邊分列着一對石馬，這樣子是多麼的莊嚴啊！我曾經聽人說過，在前淸，文官經過這裏要下轎，武官經過這裏是要下馬的，可是在民國成立以後這種田現象就沒有了。</p>
<p>巷子很寬闊，一頂八人轎是可以從容出入的。</p>
<p>在從前，那條巷子原呌「御史巷」，這陋巷的名兒是什麼時候呌出的，却沒有人知道，我想也許是那位御史大人在息影林泉之後，不願再留這御史之名，並且覺得這「陋巷」二字太好聽，太高超雅緻了，所以要呌它——</p>
<p>彷彿我童年的時候，那御史第還沒傾圯得像現在這個樣子；後面園里那株玉蘭花下，便是我和安姊採花撲蝶的地方。那個山東老鄉，人家都喊他老山束的，他雖則是四十來歲的年紀，可是孩子氣却不曾比我們减少。他閒來除了喝酒之外，就是和我們一起玩笑。</p>
<p>童年，我祇要一想起我那已經逝去的，追不回來的童年便要悲哀的，因爲我的童年是灰色的，正如現在一樣，沒有值得我咀嚼的地方，它只像一個灰色的夢，很迅速地就在我的生命中飛逝了</p>
<p>不過童年的灰色夢，終究還留得幾分天眞，所以畢竟覺得還有些可愛；然而現在，現在呢？連這僅有的天眞都不見了：現實所剩下的只是一團灰色的生活！</p>
<p>呵！我要在這里追悼我逝去的童年。</p>
<p>時光是像颶風般的在我生命里吹過：它吹去了我的童年，吹去了我的靑春，吹去了我可愛的伴侶，吹去了我親愛的安姊，吹去了……</p>
<p>爲了安姊的死，我又帶着一腔悲痛，回到別了十年的陋巷里來了；現往舊地重臨，新農更深，感到自己的身世，彷彿似一隻無擊的孤舟，飄泊在大海洋中，而僅有的一絲燈塔之光，如今也完全熄滅了，觸景生情，誠不免於愴然淚下！</p>
<p>陋巷，依舊是十年前的陋巷，然而情形却更顯得比十年以前來得荒凉寒傖了；御史第里那株玉蘭花也已給人攀折成了幾枝禿幹，就是那個老山東，雖然還苟延殘喘的活着，但一副龍鐘老態已非昔日的那麼壯健，生活的可憐，自然也就可想而知的。我同他談起往事，他那乾枯而多皺紋的眼眶里也有些潤濕了。</p>

<p>— 艾荼</p>
<p>帶着浪子的散漫的心情，那麼倥偬地給輸船載着我像浮萍一樣地飄過了海的灣，飄過了汹湧的狂濤——心情實在是沒有繩結束縛着的烏兒一樣呢，懷裏浮盪着一串一串人世的黑暗所給予我的傷瘡，好像每一件事都曾給我不可遺忘的影子似的。</p>
<p>（又是流浪的兒子歸來了。——也許母親是這樣地想着的。然而，母親至少會想到我前一次，大約是兩年多以前的夏天，我回家去的時候，還不曾脫靈了孩子氣。跳呀跳的，雖然也可以說是離朗了家鄕而劃社會上，　籌之濱、、到處地流浪着。不過，那時的經濟能力曾給我根當幸福和充分的愉快的，所以，歸去的時候，母親，可憐的母親曾拭淚地歡迎我：「兒呀！你別這樣壞皮氣吧，好好地聽人家指導，不讀書也得做一點小事兒，你看，十六歲了，再過兩三年就該娶人呢！你從小就聰明的，你不該走錯了路呀！」是的，母親是那麼地懷念着我的。然而現在呢？我流浪得爲麼樣啊？一個病態的憔悴的憂鬱的臉兒，給困苦中旅途壓得喘不過氣來的壞了的身子，一切都變了。一切都變了，也許，我這個樣子，蒼白色的臉兒只能增加了母親無限的傷心和淚珠而已。）</p>
<p>在輪渡上是這樣憂鬱地想着無限的故事來，一些熟識的兄弟朋友跟親戚們的臉孔，微笑着的天眞的小妹妹們的鮮艷的臉兒，可愛的無邪的笑哪，那，那曾把我的童年的生活史上刻下不可消磨的美夢似的影子哩。——想着，想着，流浪的生活里眞有無限的詩意的和可怕的困厄存在，有時愉快得連一點小事兒也覺得是神怪而偉大的，有時却覺得什麼都是可怕的黑魔纏繞着，那時總會咀咒人生簡直是難行的痛苦的路，到處是荊棘的苦味的，——不錯，我雖是這樣的年輕，但是我却懂得許多事兒了。如今，可以說我是帶着懷滿了憂鬱的痛創歸來了。</p>
<p>輪船從狂浪的海面駛進內河釣時分，正是血紅色的晚霞佈滿在西山，令我不能制止了自己的感傷的思潮的黃昏。這時，我可以登上船的甲板上，眼睛瞪着藍色的將黑的天空。從平靜的海面反照着的黃金色的光輝，從葱鬱的岸上的山林間飄出來的聲息，叢密的蘆葦草給黃昏的海風輕輕地飄揚着，宛若一個流落在荒島的可憐的女兒一樣。悲哀的，（黃昏的海面就是這樣地蘊藏着無限的悽愴啊！）</p>
<p>跟着時計的輾轉的旋律似的，輸船不停地滾出白銀色的浪花向兩岸邊展開着。同時，我的腦袋也跟着旋律的輾轉地，像海的波濤一樣的滾動——畢竟是黃昏時分才會意識到流浪的情調，好像一幅看不透的憂鬱的畫圖。</p>
<p>當海面飄着的風漸漸兒帶着凉寒的氣息的時候，又是習慣的地有一個影子來告訴我了——黑夜來臨了，甘竹灘的海石門已到了。同時，我記得輪船渡過了甘竹灘不多久，就該睡暈的時候，讓輸船帶實我們疲惓的身子和黑夜掙扎，到了東方掛出美麗而淸靈的曙光的時候，我的家鄉就出現我的眼前。</p>
<p>船到了甘竹灘的時候除了兩岸上的黯黑的山林的影子像鬼魔地妖惑着跟大空幾粒疏星以外，什麼都聽不見和瞧不見的。這時候就聽到比大海的波濤還要大的巨浪——甘竹灘是一個海石門的地方，海底有幾塊大石矗立着的，動不動就會把船隻翻過來，——實在，這是頂危險的地方哩。</p>
<p>然而，沙沙地，驚心地，渡通了這個地方以後，我不安靜地望着家鄉的歸途。（黑夜帶來憂鬱的懷思啊！）</p>
<h3 id="c218">倦旅人手記 <a href="#c218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>— 吉彖</p>
<p>「人當年齡漸漸地在長大起來，生活的經騐漸漸地在堆積起來的時候，他是會倦於再在用感情的尖石子所砌成的小路上奔走的；那樣，就把他呌做戚情的小路上的倦旅人吧。」</p>
<p>終淤有一次，我放膽地把這這些久已爲我所秘藏着的可怕的語句告訴她了。接着我就很快地旋過了頭—我是怕看她那驚怕的，失望的，强烈地被損害了的臉的；但是一串低沈的獨語却依舊逃不了在我的耳邊飄過：」什麼話哪—你，你還很年靑呢。你—」</p>
<p>是的，也許眞的還很年靑呢；但年靑人是有着二條壯健的腿與一顆大膽的心的，是勇於在感情的狹道上馳驅的啊；而我，却有着一種萎縮的倦旅人的心，而追，又爲什麼帶着那麼多的中年人的夕暮的心情呢？</p>
<p>於是我想到了：縱然我在她底嘴裏是年靑的，而自然的現實却處處地給了我沈落的恐嚇呢。也許她底語句對我僅是一種安神劑，而現實的恐嚇則是一種警告吧？如果眞是這樣的，那末我寗願丟棄她底欺騙，粉飾，與麻醉的安神劑，而將更感謝地去接受自然之現象所給予我的可貴的警告了。因爲前者所安慰我的是一種欺騙；而後者，卽使惠嚇了我，却也是一種十分寶貴的眞實呢。</p>
<p>是的，已經不是年靑的時代了；已經是一個疲於在情感的狹路上奔波的倦旅人了！</p>
<p>翻開深閉在心頭的多少半來在感受的荒區中行旅與探險的冊籍，那些麥一般的記載，已不再能使人神往的了；年靑人是好奇與胃險的，懷着一種更新奇與與奮的心，帶一支行路杖，帶一個糧袋，而有時，也許會帶一隻羅盤與一冊小小的旅行指南，那樣，就孤獨　蘭到人世間之感受的荒區中去了。那兒是有着詩一般的雲花，也有着雷雨前的黑天的。忍耐地跨過一步步的旅程，時代也一步步地在移過去；荒山與深坑經過了，小溪與果樹園也經過了：春天的鳥兒是幸福的，夏天的樹也有着數不完的生氣，可是，現在已經是秋天了啊。感受的荒區要，是不適宜於作秋季旅行的，瞧那無邊的灰黃色的曠漠，與沒有水草的土坵罷。</p>
<p>於是在旅人的遊記所寫上的全是一些可怕如惡夢一般的詩篇，旅人底勇氣是完了，旅人底年靑的好奇也盡了。放下手杖與行囊，他所需要的不再是奇境探尋，無僅是，平平凡凡的，沒有高潮也沒有低落的，閑靜得如一個田舍裏的老人一樣的休息—靜坐在陽光要抽一斗烟，與喘一口氣了。旅人已經不再生靑，也不再有靑色的好奇：旅人是卷了！</p>
<p>已經不值得去追懷與感傷了。情感約荒區中始終不會像花園一般的綺魔的。人生活着，人也在滿鋪着尖石子的情戚的小道上奔跑着。而如今是，人已在不斷的疲勞中倦起來，人需要找一個路徑走向歸來的路去，人要休息！</p>
<p>一切已經過去的任他過去，而一、切要來的也任他來吧！總之，從情感的小路上奔跑着歸來的旅程已經像老牛一般地倦了。不要問我那些惡夢般的遊記，也不要再把我重行牽向崎嶇的情感的路上去—且仔細瞧一瞧倦旅人的僕僕風塵的臉色吧。</p>

<h3 id="c227">公共紀念建築物之設計 <a href="#c227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>— 小昂</p>
<p>這幾年來，我國各地，建築公共紀念物，是風思　　　了，不過這種紀念建築物的特性和精神，必須藉建築的技藝，方能表現出　，所以牠的設計方面，是很值得去研究的，大凡一種建築的設計，必需合乎下列四原則，我現在就根據這四原則，把公共紀念建築物的設計，來申論一下罷。</p>
<p>（一）效用　大槪公共紀念建築物，如中由紀念堂，陣亡將士紀念塔，革命先烈祠等，都有牠特殊的目的和價值，所以位置的選擇和作風的選擇，是一個很重要的問題，如果選擇不良，牠的效用就失去了，紀念建築物，應建於風景宜人，交通便利的地方，地勢宜四周爲高，並宜多留空地，使各方面都可以看到，至若作風方面，許多建築家都說希臘羅馬的建築，是很雄偉精巧的，最適宜於紀念物，我以爲中國式的建築，也是很好的，如果你跑到南京的中山陵和廣州的中山紀念堂，你就覺得建築雄壯，工程浩大，地勢適宜，令人肅然起敬了，倘若再到燉煌石窰，白馬諸寺，你就會想到唐代文物之盛，帝國之威嚴了這些都是中國固有式的建築，但是又不失去牠的效用，較之西洋建築有過之無不及，建築家何妨把中國固有的建築式，來光輝一下呢。</p>
<p>（二）堅固　公共紀念建築物，必須特別堅固，歷千百年而不壞，能抵抗風雪的壓力，人物的摧殘，兩水潮濕的侵蝕，和火災的焚滅，所以建築材料的選擇，又是要特別注意的，石類中的光崗石，是最能經久的材料，大理石比較貴一點，但是漂亮多了，鋼骨混凝土，也是很好的，談到堅固，要較花崗石次一等了，不過便宜的緣故，採用的也很多，木料和銅鐵造成的紀念建築物，是最少的了。</p>
<p>（三）美觀　效用堅固之外，而能充分發揮建築物的精神的，就是從美觀方面着手了建築的形式和材料的色彩，宜當一律，以免散漫，結構方面，應當時起變化，麼看起來，不至於滯呆了，各項建築，都應對稱，表現那莊重的氣槪來，風緻宜奇特，以示幽逸，這些無非是增加美觀，引人入勝而已。</p>
<p>（四）經濟　當這國難環迫，創痛劇增的時候，一切公共建築物築設，不妨簡單一點，節省一點，以收節省儉約之效。</p>
<h3 id="c228">關於建築上「做法」及「算例」的芻議 <a href="#c228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>— 歐陽古</p>
<p>中國關於建築工程「做法」的記載，在淸代工部與內庭，都已有明白的頒定，許多匠家，也都奉他爲程式。但所謂工程上的「做法」一層，大概都在木匠師傳敎授徒弟的時候，互相傳授的口頭工作，在筆墨底下根本是很難說的。所以那時頒定的做法則例，實在就是算法而不是做法，做法須要說明如何動手，如何鋸，如何刨，如何安裝……總之說明「做」，這些都是活的東西，「算例」却須要說明結構部份機能上數量的原則，包括一切尺寸大小地位的關係，譬如瓦匠建造牆基襯脚的勾股弦算法，本來是淺易的平面幾何，假使一經用文字寫出，再加些不淸不爽的歌訣，豈不是反而弄得糊糊塗塗，我們目的旣在建築而不在數學，但也需要一個簡明改革的「算例」方好，如普通對於圓形的求法，最準確的是「按直徑乘三一四一六」，但一般泥水木匠在求紋圈圍長的時侯，卻用「三三加之」的算法，却相差太遠了，這種錯誤，還是淺顯的哩，要是數目大了，「差之亳厘，失之千里」，那才不得了咧。</p>
<p>建築上的變化是無窮的，不論是一個工程師或是泥水木匠，都得明暸舉一反三的秘訣，若是呆板的依據某一建築物放大或縮小一分一寸，那是不可能的事。因爲關於每一建築物上各部份的長寬高的記出，都是獨立與絕對的，不能把牠作爲依據或比例，所以營造術中關於「算例」佔的地位十分重要，而且必須精確，也是爲了這個緣故。</p>
<p>現在以近代觀念來研究建築的人，所注意的重要點，大都在藝術與工程方面，忽略了我國原來向有的「樣房」和「算房」二種方法，這裏也須說明關於這二種方法的專責，樣房是和現代的建築師差不多，主要的職務是設計。「算房」的職責，較似現代的輔助士木工程師，專門管理計算材料的助手，這種算法有許多地方還附帶的解釋關於「樣」的方面，我們現假使也能由算的方法得以推求出「樣」的則例，那才是一件可喜的收獲。</p>
<p>關於建築物各部份的定義和解釋，本刋逐期載有「建築行話」，牠的益處也很大，能使一般對於中國建築還沒有相當認識的人，見了這許多怪名詞，不致十分生疏，總之建築的創造如同一切藝術的創造一般，不應該受各方面的拘束，那些呆板的「算例」與紙上談兵的「做法」，很像立下了圈套來摧殘或束縛那些靑年建築家的創造力，並且同時還須注意「溫故而知新」，藉此增廣知識，使對於建築界上有整個的暸解，以致於在中國建築史上開一個新紀元。</p>

<p>(Chongqing) According to a telegram from Mianyang on the 12th, it is reported that at Shen Shi (3-5 pm) on the 10th, the bandits launched a counterattack with great urgency. Our Chen Regiment led its troops in a fierce assault, leading the charge and killing more than ten bandits who jumped into the caves. After three hours of fierce fighting and several hand-to-hand combats, the bandits were routed, with over two hundred bandits killed. Several bandit flags and dozens of guns were seized. On the morning of the 11th, the bandits attacked again, and after two hours of fierce fighting, they were repelled. Our troops then built fortifications on Huangjia Mountain for defense. At midnight, the bandits launched a fierce attack from Shenlongtang and Caizi'e, but we bombarded them with machine guns and grenades, causing heavy bandit casualties. (Central News Agency telegram, 13th)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) According to a telegram from Ya'an on the 12th, it is reported that from 7 am to 5 pm on the 11th, our army killed many bandits. (Central News Agency telegram, 13th)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) Military News: (1) After our Route Army launched its offensive, progress was made on all fronts. Qushan, Dengjiaqu, Yimiechang, Xiangshuichang, and other places along the Tongkou River were all occupied by our troops. Strong fortifications have now been built to defend strategic locations and await further advance. (2) Most of the bandits in the Beichuan area are in the Da'an Mountain area and are being pursued by our Sun Army. Fierce battles have been fought for several days. The bandits' attempts to invade Anxian and Mianyang have become futile. A portion of them are attempting to detour through Dazhu Mountain and flee towards Jiangyou.

<p>Kunming, the 11th: Chairman Long hosted a banquet for Chairman Chiang at the Bandit Suppression Headquarters on the evening of the 11th. Chairman Long delivered a welcome speech, stating: (A) This visit of the Chairman to Yunnan has broken all previous records of a national leader showing concern. (B) If there are any errors in past facilities, please instruct us to correct them, and we earnestly request your guidance and support. (C) Yunnan will always fight for the country and for justice, obey the will of the Chairman, and carry out all orders. Chairman Chiang then gave an address, stating: Yunnan is the most important revolutionary base, and it has a glorious revolutionary history. I have long wanted to visit, but have been unable to do so. I am very happy to meet with all the comrades, and my emotions are indescribable. The Central Government and Yunnan can be said to be interdependent. Personally, I and Chairman Long share joys and hardships. Since I took responsibility in the Central Government, Chairman Long has also presided over provincial affairs in Yunnan. Chairman Long and I can be said to have jointly assumed the revolutionary responsibilities left by the late Premier at the same time. That evening, the Chairman and Chairman Long were extremely pleased. (Central News Agency telegram, 13th)</p>
<p>Kunming: A lantern festival is being held here tonight to express a warm welcome to Chairman Chiang and his wife. Seven thousand students are participating. Boy Scouts and female students have created lanterns with great ingenuity. There are many types of lanterns, some shaped like tanks, airplanes, and ships.

<h3 id="e3">Central Government and National Government Memorial Weeks Report; Ji Liang: Personality and Career; Qin Zhen: Premier's Experience in Protecting the Constitution <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central Government held its 18th Memorial Week on the morning of the 13th. Central Committee members Ye Chucang, Chen Lifu, Deng Jiayan, Li Zonghuang, Ji Liang, Miao Peicheng, Dai Kuisheng, and all staff members, totaling approximately five hundred people, attended. Chairman Ye Chucang presided. Ji Liang reported on "Personality and Career," stating: Personality is the minimum standard for being a person. Confucius specifically pointed out: "Do not look at what is contrary to propriety, do not listen to what is contrary to propriety, do not speak of what is contrary to propriety, do not move in a manner contrary to propriety." This is the standard for a person. What is a career? It is the actions of those who cultivate good personalities, or efforts that impact society. The Premier specifically said: "The career of fire is the career of saving the country." We should know that first one must have a good personality, and then one's career will also be good. Generally, people misunderstand personality and career as two unrelated things. In fact, the two are inseparable. The Premier said, "Do not aspire to be a high official, aspire to do great things." The so-called great things are the responsibility of saving the country. I hope all comrades will follow the Premier's teachings, cultivate good personalities, and aspire to do great things. The meeting adjourned at 10 am after the speech. (Central News Agency telegram, 13th)</p>

After Chairman Lin led the ceremony, Deputy President Qin of the Judicial Yuan gave a report. He first described in great detail the Premier's experience in protecting the Constitution. He then stated that many people misunderstand the Premier's protection of the Constitution as being about the Provisional Constitution. They do not know that the Premier's greatest goal in protecting the Constitution was to promote the fundamental law of the country, and that the drafting of this law would fully integrate the spirit of the Three Principles of the People and the Five-Power Constitution. Finally, he expressed his opinion that the most important component of a country's constitution is that it should be suitable for the habits of its citizens. (Central News Agency telegram, 13th)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Since the Japanese side intends to upgrade its embassy in China, it has been largely decided. Foreign media have also reported that the Japanese embassy in China has decided to move south. According to sources from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Japanese side has not yet mentioned this matter to us, and the details are unclear. (Special Telegram, 13th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the issue of upgrading diplomatic envoys between China and Japan, it is learned that the matter has been progressing smoothly through negotiations between the two sides recently, and it may be realized in the near future. It is also rumored that the Japanese embassy in China is preparing to move to Nanjing. (Central News Agency telegram, 13th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The issue of the Japanese embassy moving south can only be finalized after the Japanese ambassador to China is upgraded. Whether the Japanese side will establish a consulate general in Beiping after the embassy moves south can be decided after Ariyoshi returns to his post. However, the relevant parties do not deny that the embassy's military attaché office will remain in Beiping. It is rumored that the current military attaché, Takahashi Tan, will be transferred, and that the Japanese military attaché in Shanghai, Isotani, will be transferred to Beiping. (Special Telegram, 13th)</p>
<p>(London) The Japanese ambassador to Britain, Matsudaira, told a Reuters reporter today that Japan had decided to upgrade its embassy in China several years ago. The budget had already stipulated the necessary funding at that time, but it was not implemented because the timing was not yet ripe. Now that China and Japan have a more pleasant understanding, the Japanese government believes that the time is right. As for the rumor that Japan intends to expel Western advisors from China, it is pure nonsense and not worth laughing at. Matsudaira will return to Japan in July, but this is only a short leave, as he still has many things to deal with in Britain. The Japanese ambassadors to various European countries will meet in Paris in June, and Matsudaira will also attend. He claimed today that this kind of meeting is truly an innovation and has no special significance, but he feels that it is beneficial. According to London official sources, there is an agreement among the great powers that any government wishing to upgrade its embassy in China must first notify other countries, but there is no question of obtaining consent before upgrading. Those familiar with Far Eastern affairs believe that the decision to upgrade the Japanese embassy is inevitable in terms of Japan's position in the Far East. (Reuters telegram, 13th)</p>

<p>(Tianjin) Fang Zhiwu and Zheng Shunhua, representatives of the Liujiang Coal Mining Company, arrived in Tianjin on the night of the 12th and went to the Construction Bureau on the morning of the 13th to meet with Director Hu Yuanhui to report on the situation after the company's wharf warehouse in Qinhuangdao was sealed and the railway tracks were demolished. They requested the Construction Bureau to quickly instruct Yuan Tai, the magistrate of Linyu County, to negotiate to avoid excessive losses to the company. In the afternoon of the 13th, Fang and Zheng left Tianjin and returned to Qinhuangdao. Su Yuqi, the chief of the Shanhaiguan Public Security Bureau, telegraphed the Construction Bureau to report on the current situation after the Liujiang wharf warehouse was sealed and the traffic situation after the light railway was destroyed. The Construction Bureau instructed Su Yuqi to carefully guard against accidents and assist Magistrate Yuan in conducting negotiations to resolve the matter as soon as possible. (Special Telegram, 13th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) A person in charge of the Construction Bureau said that the disputed mining area between the Liujiang Mine and the Taiji Mine, Heishanyao, is also known as Heishiyao and covers an area of 1,236 mu. The Taiji Mine covers an area of 4,339 mu. The Heishanyao mining area is a triangle located between the Liujiang and Taiji Mines. When the Taiji Company renewed its license in the sixth year of the Republic (1917), technicians from the Construction Bureau went to survey the area and clearly demarcated the boundaries. The Bureau rejected Taiji's attempt to claim the Heishanyao mining area and added a note to the Liujiang Mine map: "The area east of the mountain belongs to Zhang Dexun's mining rights." Although the Taiji Mine map showed the fourth and ninth boundary lines for the mine pit, it omitted the note "The area west of here belongs to Zhang Dexun's mining rights." However, the map was not colored, and it was immediately clear that it did not belong to it when compared to the Taiji Mine's own area map. The current manager of the Taiji Mine, the Japanese Ishida, is not the original investor. The original company was jointly run with the Chinese Sun Jiwu by Mitani. Later, Mitani withdrew due to losses and transferred it to another Japanese. How Ishida obtained the joint venture rights is unknown. However, the Mining Law stipulates that the mining rights are only confirmed to be owned by Chinese. Regardless of how the investment is raised or with which country it is jointly run, it must comply with Chinese mining laws and regulations. This dispute is a commercial dispute, and the intervention of the Japanese police station is inappropriate. (Special Telegram, 13th)</p>

Two hundred and forty-five Japanese troops stationed in Beiping arrived in Tianjin at 8:30 am on the 13th by a special train of the Beining Railway and entered the Haiguang Temple barracks for troop rotation.

Minister of Finance Kong will take a copy of the original plan to Shanghai for review and incidentally seek opinions from all parties. It is heard that the Ministry of Finance's principle for the tax is to be universal. However, if the household registration law has not yet been properly implemented, public officials have records that can be verified and have no way to evade. Non-public officials are difficult to thoroughly investigate based solely on a one-time survey. If tax bureaus are universally established to collect taxes when the tax is implemented, the tax administration fees will inevitably exceed the tax revenue. Both of these require detailed study.

<p>(Nanjing) Wu Jing, the head of the Customs Policy Section of the Customs Administration, reported on the process of abolishing the transit tax and reducing or exempting export taxes during Memorial Week, stating that the transit tax is similar to likin and should have been abolished after likin. However, due to financial difficulties and the fact that the annual revenue from the tax is around 15 million yuan, it is a small supplement to the government's finances, so it has been delayed until now. This time, the central government, in order to provide overall relief to the country's declining industry and commerce, decided to abolish the transit tax in order to reduce costs, which is a very good intention. The compensation measures are being planned comprehensively and will be decided soon. The reduction and exemption of export taxes is an important measure to encourage exports. The reduction and exemption standards for soybeans, peanut oil, and other items have been set to reduce export taxes. Special local products sold overseas should also be given separate exemptions. Export taxes can still be implemented after legal procedures. (Special Telegram, 13th)</p>

<h3 id="e18">Reading Minister Kong's Financial Report <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>— Yan</p>
<p>Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi has compiled a detailed report on the financial situation of the past two years, ending June 30, 1934. It was officially released yesterday. (Full text can be found on the third page of today's newspaper) The content of the report not only provides a general description of the financial situation of the past two years, allowing the people to understand the past national finances, but also outlines the points of emphasis and their implementation in the government's future economic construction, as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Implementing a more effective budget system to control expenditures.</p>
<p>(2) Clearing overdue debts.</p>
<p>(3) Reorganizing the salt tax, implementing a uniform tax rate, abolishing surcharges, improving salt quality, and implementing strict management of production and transportation.</p>
<p>(4) Reorganizing tariff rates to increase tax revenue without affecting industrial products and daily necessities for the general public. As for special export products, reduce or completely eliminate export taxes within a possible range to encourage them.</p>
<p>(5) Continuing to find ways to adjust and reduce provincial and municipal local taxes to achieve a mutually supportive effect with the central tax system.</p>
<p>(6) Encouraging and controlling important domestic industries, such as cotton yarn, cotton cloth, and raw silk.</p>
<p>(7) Stabilizing the currency and unifying subsidiary coins to remove obstacles to industry and commerce.</p>
<p>(8) Improving transportation, especially developing railways and highways.</p>
<p>(9) Aiding agriculture, the foundation of the country, and seeking the development of the rural economy.</p>
<p>Of the above nine items, as far as we know, some have already been implemented successively, and some are being planned and implemented. The facts are clearly verifiable. Judging from the results achieved, such as the clearance of overdue debts in the second item, taking the price of foreign debt in the London market as an example, it has soared to an unprecedented level since the full repayment of the remaining Anglo-French loans and the payment plan for the principal of the Crisp bonds. This is why it enhances our country's external reputation. Secondly, the government's efforts in monetary policy are also obvious. The formulation of restrictions on the exchange of banknotes by provincial or local banks is one aspect of stabilizing the local currency system. The biggest difficulty in our country's currency in the past year has been the threat of the US silver policy. Our financial authorities have been able to take a calm attitude to respond, using silver export taxes and equalization taxes to prevent large-scale silver exports. Regarding the recent repeated increases in silver prices by the United States, the conclusion of a "gentleman's agreement" has eliminated the storm in its invisible form. All of this shows the government's painstaking efforts in stabilizing the currency. What is particularly important is that Minister Kong's report also points out that in today's extremely difficult financial situation, the government still pays attention to economic construction as a way to national rejuvenation. The various achievements listed in transportation and industrial construction are unprecedented in China for decades. Therefore, in Minister Kong's report, his dedication and spirit are clearly visible and should not be regarded as an ordinary political report.</p>

<p>Warsaw – General Piłsudski, the pillar of Poland, passed away today at the age of sixty-seven. Piłsudski was the de facto dictator of Poland and one of the most famous figures in modern Europe. Piłsudski had been suffering from abdominal cancer for a long time, but he was still able to meet with British Lord Privy Seal Eden when he visited Warsaw. Afterwards, his condition worsened, so he was unable to meet with French Foreign Minister Laval during his visit. According to officials, Piłsudski's condition was quite serious, and it was not expected that he would pass away. The news of his death spread at 9:30 tonight, shocking the entire country and causing immense grief. Piłsudski's name will endure alongside Mussolini, Kemal, Masaryk, Lenin, and Chang. Piłsudski had great ambitions from a young age, taking the restoration of the country as his responsibility. He dedicated his life to this and died before witnessing Poland break free from its shackles, regain its independence, and join the ranks of European powers. He can die in peace. (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<p>The Circumstances of His Death</p>
<p>Warsaw – General Piłsudski, who fell into a coma last night, passed away at 9:30 after five hours. Professors Wenkebuff of Vienna and Stefanowicz, both renowned doctors, determined that the General had been suffering from stomach cancer, which led to his death. Government ministers and army generals were at his bedside when he passed away. Therefore, there are rumors that the General drafted a political will before his death, but this has not been confirmed. (Havas, 12th)</p>
<p>Warsaw – According to General Piłsudski's doctor, Piłsudski's death was due to nephritis. Piłsudski had been suffering from kidney disease for a long time, and his condition worsened in the past two weeks. His wife and two daughters were by his side when he passed away. His eldest daughter, Wanda, is sixteen years old, and his second daughter, Jadwiga, is fourteen years old. Piłsudski's remains are currently displayed in the Belweder Palace. Government officials gathered here on Monday night, and countless mourning citizens stood solemnly in front of the palace. (National Telegraph, 13th)</p>

<p>Warsaw – Today, the entire country of Poland is mourning Piłsudski. In the early morning, Prime Minister Dr. Kościalkowski led cabinet members to the Belweder Palace to pay their respects to Piłsudski. (Reuters, 13th)</p>
<p>When Piłsudski passed away, government officials were all by his bedside. Piłsudski was still lucid and had no pain. The Ministry of War has been temporarily taken over by General Kasprzycki. At the same time, the government ordered all theaters to suspend performances and radio broadcasts to cancel their programming. (Reuters, 13th)</p>
<p>Emergency Cabinet Meeting</p>
<p>Warsaw – After the death of Minister of Military Affairs General Piłsudski, Prime Minister Colonel Sławek convened the cabinet for an emergency meeting. That evening, a bulletin was issued, urging the public to remain calm, and it was decided to appoint General Rydz-Śmigły (a close confidant of Piłsudski) to succeed the late General as Inspector General of the Army. His vacant post as Minister of Military Affairs will be temporarily held by the current Deputy Minister of the Army, Kasprzycki. (Havas, 12th)</p>
<p>Warsaw – Although important Polish affairs of state were always discussed with Piłsudski before decisions were made, Piłsudski's death will not cause any unrest. The current President of Poland, Mościcki, is an old friend of Piłsudski, and his election also relied on Piłsudski's support. The Polish parliament recently passed a new constitution, granting great power to the President, so that the centralist system created by Piłsudski can be maintained permanently, accommodate all classes, and eliminate party strife. Poland's external position is probably more stable than ever today, due to the following three major reasons: (1) A ten-year agreement with Germany; (2) A non-aggression pact with Soviet Russia; (3) The Franco-Polish alliance is still in effect.

<p>President Recalls Achievements</p>
<p>Changsha – This morning, the national radio station broadcast a statement signed by President Mościcki, saying that General Piłsudski worked hard to build a strong country and used his intelligence to revive Poland, truly a great figure unprecedented in our history.

<h3 id="e22">A Brief History of Piłsudski <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>General Piłsudski was born on December 5, 1867, in Zułów, near Vilnius. Piłsudski's family was wealthy. In 1863, because his family participated in demonstrations against the Tsar, most of the family's assets were confiscated by the Russian authorities. Therefore, Piłsudski grew up in a pro-Russian atmosphere. In 1874, Piłsudski's estate was destroyed by fire, and the family moved to Vilnius. At that time, the family property was declining, so life was very simple. Piłsudski studied at the Vilnius High School, where he often violated school rules. He was reprimanded by Russian teachers for speaking Polish in the school square. In 1885, he completed his preparatory work and entered Kharkov University to study medicine. Piłsudski was arrested and imprisoned twice for participating in revolutionary movements. At the age of twenty, he was arrested for plotting to assassinate Tsar Alexander III and exiled to Siberia for five years. From then on, his determination to resist Russia became stronger. At the age of thirty-two, he was imprisoned in the Warsaw Citadel for more than a year. Before long, he escaped from prison and fled to Austria. From then on, he acted more cautiously, and he expected that Austria and Russia would eventually meet on the battlefield. Therefore, he secretly organized Polish battle teams in Austria. In 1905, when Russia and Japan fought in Manchuria, Piłsudski went to Tokyo to join the war, intending to start an uprising behind the Russian army line to disturb it, but the Japanese authorities did not allow it, and his plan failed. In 1914, Piłsudski's opportunity suddenly came. After Piłsudski was released from exile in Siberia, he instilled the idea of ​​raising troops to resist Russia and restore Polish independence in the minds of his compatriots. He fought tirelessly for decades. Piłsudski, in view of the failures of 1830 and 1863, not only sought to resist the powerful Russia, but also worked to eliminate the self-debasement of his compatriots, because those people were afraid of Russia's power and advocated reconciliation with the Russian government. Piłsudski was confident that his cause would eventually succeed, so even if his entire family opposed him, he would not be discouraged. He was also resourceful and good at predicting things. In 1914, Piłsudski predicted that the world war would break out. The Polish Riflemen team he organized in Austria was used to join the Russian army in combat, hoping to make contributions to restore Poland's freedom. Piłsudski personally led the First Brigade of the Polish Foreign Legion, which then</p>

<p>became the backbone of the Polish army. In June 1917, Polish detachments fighting in the Russian, German, and Austrian armies all recognized Piłsudski as their leader. On the night of July 20, 1917, Piłsudski was detained by German officers in the Magdeburg fortress for refusing to swear allegiance to the Central Powers. A year earlier, at the request of the German Supreme Commander, the Central Powers announced their intention to restore Poland's freedom. Piłsudski was summoned from the countryside to organize a provisional government in Warsaw, in which Piłsudski also held a seat. Before long, he had a disagreement with German officers. Piłsudski was imprisoned in the Magdeburg fortress. It was not until the Central Powers failed in November 1918 that he was released. On the 10th of that month, Piłsudski formally entered Warsaw and became a national hero. Two days later, he was elected as the provisional President of Poland. On the 2nd of February 1919, the Polish Republic's parliament formally declared Piłsudski as the head of state. At that time, the constitution had not yet been established, so he was not elected according to law. In 1921, the new constitution was promulgated, and the presidential election was held according to law the following year. In November 1920, the entire Polish army publicly elected General Piłsudski as the first general. In that year, Piłsudski formally visited France and Romania, and the people of both capitals praised him as the savior of Poland. In 1923, Piłsudski resigned from the position of head of state and retired to the countryside to write his autobiography. In 1926, Piłsudski was convinced that the country was gradually showing signs of pre-war chaos and was in danger of bankruptcy, so on May 12, he led several detachments of troops into Warsaw. After three days of street fighting, he overthrew President Wojciechowski and the Witos cabinet. Thereupon, the people all elected Piłsudski to resume the presidency, but Piłsudski strongly refused and elected his old friend Mościcki, who had conspired with him in the revolution, to replace him. Since 1926, Piłsudski has always served as the Inspector General of the Army and Minister of Defense, except for holding the post of Prime Minister twice (once from 1926 to 1928, and once in 1930). Piłsudski married Maria Juszkiewicz in 1894. His wife also participated in the revolution and was once imprisoned. They had two daughters. Piłsudski was the de facto dictator of Poland in his later years. Often, when he held state affairs meetings, if his daughter happened to arrive, he would stop the meeting and listen to his daughter tell about her school affairs. Piłsudski was quick to handle affairs. In November 1918, he arrived in Warsaw from Magdeburg at 8 pm. After meeting with 32 representatives of various political parties, he worked day and night and quickly restored order and prevented the country from falling into chaos. Piłsudski often walked to the Ministry of Defense every day and worked until 3 or 4 pm, then went to bed until 9 am the next morning. Whenever he thought about important matters, he would walk around the room. This habit was probably acquired in Russian prisons, and he smoked countless cigarettes, all specially made for Piłsudski, so they were called "General Cigarettes." Whenever Piłsudski made an important decision, he would first rest for half an hour to recuperate. When he played cards, he always used 13 as his lucky number. (Reuters, 13th)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) – The sudden death of General Piłsudski, the de facto dictator of Poland, was reported by all newspapers here, which recounted his life and achievements and sent condolences to Poland. Japanese Foreign Minister Hirota said in an interview with journalists that he met General Piłsudski thirty years ago during the Russo-Japanese War, when Piłsudski was a political prisoner living in Japan. At that time, he was a university student and served as General Piłsudski's interpreter. (Reuters, 13th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) – General Piłsudski, the Polish dictator who died yesterday, was a Russian revolutionary member during the Russo-Japanese War and stayed in Japan for half a year. Foreign Minister Hirota spoke today as follows: At that time, I was a student and was entrusted by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to serve as an interpreter. General Piłsudski and three others were introduced by General Akashi to visit Yamae Enjiro of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and meet with General Fukushima, requesting to continue the war and destroy the Romanov family. One day, he said he wanted to try Japanese food, so he ate raw carp in a restaurant and even ate the eyes of the raw carp. If it were someone else, he would definitely spit it out, but Piłsudski was always strong and swallowed it with whiskey. He was truly an outstanding figure at that time. (Den Tsushin, 13th)</p>

<p>(Paris) – The news of the death of Polish Minister of Military Affairs General Piłsudski arrived. At the same time, the results of the Paris City Council elections have mostly been announced, so today's newspaper commentary focuses more on this picture, while rarely mentioning diplomatic issues. L'Avenir said, "The sudden death of General Piłsudski is like the passing of a parent to the entire nation of Poland. Piłsudski's life was spent fighting bravely for the independence and liberation of Poland. In recent times, Poland has taken a different path in international politics and adopted novel policies (referring to Poland's pro-German stance). However, we cannot blame the late General for this, because all great figures have temporary shortcomings. In short, Poland's ability to flourish is not possible without the guidance of the late General. Therefore, although there are many objectionable aspects of the late General's dictatorship, people can still forgive him. If those who succeed the late General implement the same dictatorial politics, it is questionable whether they will be approved by the world." Le Figaro published an article written by Taumo Sen, saying, "The late General was a national hero, and his life's achievements are truly amazing. Today's European situation relies on the creation of some outstanding figures, and the late General is one of them." (Havas, 13th)</p>

The current atmosphere in Warsaw seems to want to change course and seek friendship with France. Therefore, after Piłsudski's death, there will be no one to inherit him. It should be known that dictatorial politics cannot be inherited." (Havas, 13th)</p>
<p>(Vienna) – The Neue Wiener Tagblatt commented on the death of the Polish dictator Piłsudski, saying, "Although Lenin, the creator of Bolshevism, has passed away, Bolshevism still exists. Whether Poland's internal and external affairs will change after General Piłsudski's death cannot be predicted at present, although it is too early to do so. However, Poland, which has implemented a dictatorship for nine years, is already much stronger than Russia at the time of Lenin's death." (Havas, 13th)</p>

During the Great War, many Hungarians participated in the Polish Foreign Legion organized by Piłsudski. During Poland's war against Soviet Russia, Hungary also tried to support Poland. In recent years, the friendship between Hungary and Poland has been particularly strong. Hungarian people have always regarded Piłsudski as a symbol of Polish independence and the struggle against Bolshevism. A Catholic newspaper commented that "Piłsudski was a sincere and noble friend of Poland. Thanks to his efforts, the friendship between Hungary and Poland has increased day by day. In the future, the friendship between the two countries will continue unchanged." (Havas, 13th)</p>

<p>(Berlin) According to a Rome dispatch in the Berliner Tageblatt, negotiations between French Aviation Minister Denain and the Italian military authorities are underway. The goal of both parties is to conclude a Franco-Italian sky agreement of a military alliance nature. According to reliable sources, the main points are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The contracting states shall notify each other of the quantity and effectiveness of their air forces at any time. (2) If the air force of one of the contracting states is attacked by a thirteenth country, it must immediately come to the aid of the other party. (3) Once a war breaks out, for the sake of unified command of the air forces of both sides, another agreement should be made to stipulate alternating command or, depending on the actual situation during the war, to be placed under the command of one party. (4) The areas in which the air forces provide mutual assistance should also be determined.</p>
<p>Because of the provisions of these practical clauses, the newspaper believes that the effect of this sky agreement is more practical than the Franco-Russian agreement. At the same time, this kind of mutual assistance is entirely automatic, so once it is launched, the land and naval forces of the two countries will inevitably be mobilized at the same time. Although the governments of the two countries will still have to use the Anglo-French declaration of London as a talisman on the surface, its nature will inevitably be very different from the spirit of the London Declaration.

<p>(London) According to speculation by financial figures, when German leader Hitler makes a statement on foreign policy in the House of Commons on the 16th of this month, he will probably adopt a compromising tone. Hitler intends to obtain a loan of £750,000 from the Bank of England to pay for goods exported from the UK. However, British financial figures do not approve of this loan, because if this loan is given to Germany, Germany will definitely use it to rearm. For this reason, Hitler has to adopt a moderate tone to dispel the fears of British bankers. (Havas, 13th)</p>

<p>(London) The Times newspaper today published an editorial strongly defending Germany, saying that since the European War, the treatment Germany has received in terms of armaments has been unfair. Therefore, all countries should be tolerant of this rearmament. The newspaper also said, "Although it is regrettable that Germany internally promotes aggressive nationalism and externally adopts the same diplomatic strategy as before the war, if Hitler adopts reckless measures to implement the purpose of rearmament, the blame should not be entirely borne by Hitler. All those who have promised Germany equal treatment and then gone back on their word should share the responsibility. Although Germany's rearmament is often inappropriate, the reasons on which it is based are beyond reproach. In short, there are two points that must be noted at present: first, Hitler has never made completely unreasonable demands; second, the international obligations unilaterally violated by Hitler (referring to the military clauses of the Treaty of Versailles) are those that he has always firmly rejected and never voluntarily accepted."

<p>(Washington) Treasury Secretary Morgenthau will make a radio broadcast speech to the country tomorrow, in which he will probably make an extremely important announcement on the US monetary system policy, especially focusing on the silver purchase plan. Financial and business leaders today expect the Treasury Secretary to make this announcement, because the Treasury's cash reserves have been increasing day by day, reaching an unprecedented high of $800 million, making it increasingly difficult to implement Congress's silver purchase order. The Treasury Department today announced that the Treasury Secretary's speech will begin at 11:00 tomorrow night (1:00 AM Shanghai time). The topic of his speech is "The US Dollar." It is said that the Treasury Secretary will review the New Deal's monetary system policy. However, observers believe that the declaration made by the Treasury Secretary this time is very important, and he may also refute those who criticize the government's policy. The speed at which the Treasury's gold reserves have increased has made it difficult to implement the 1934 silver purchase, and that law stipulates that the US monetary reserve must be three parts gold and one part silver. The recent US silver purchases abroad have been greatly reduced, so observers here believe that the Treasury Secretary may announce a plan to resolve the silver issue, and completely end all doubts about silver in the monetary system policy.

The original letter is translated as follows: "Mr. Director Butler, after the previous dispatch of Mr. Bourne and Mr. Bedson from your bureau to China to provide assistance, our country's factory inspection has benefited greatly. This office was established in August of the 22nd year and has formulated implementation plans and procedures in accordance with various relevant labor laws and regulations, and has taken the establishment of a factory inspection foundation" and "promoting factory inspections in various countries" as the policy guidelines. So far, 19 provinces and cities have implemented it according to law. Among these 19 provinces and cities, those that have completed the first phase of work in accordance with the "Factory Inspection Implementation Procedures" formulated by this office include Weihaiwei, Hankou, Beiping, the urban area of Shanghai, and five places in Henan Province. Most of the remaining provinces and cities will be completed in June of this year, which is gratifying. Factory inspections in various provinces and cities have made considerable progress in recent years (see the 23rd China Factory Inspection Annual Report). If this continues, our country's factory inspection can achieve satisfactory results. However, the failure to resolve the Shanghai Concession factory inspection negotiations is not only the most unfortunate event for the future of factory inspection in our country in Shanghai, but also deeply regrettable. In order to maintain the integrity of China's factory inspection administration, at the 18th International Labor Conference, Mr. Li Pingheng, the former director of our country's government delegation, gave a detailed account of the negotiation process. At that time, I was assured that I would communicate with the relevant countries to solve it as soon as possible. After the director of your branch, Cheng Haifeng, tried his best to mediate in a private capacity, the Shanghai Concession authorities had an unclear attitude, which caused this negotiation to remain in a deadlock. Now that this International Labor Conference is about to open, our country's representatives should still make statements in accordance with their original intentions, and I hope that your bureau director will give practical assistance so that the Shanghai Concession factory inspection negotiations can be resolved in a short period of time."

<p>(Taiyuan) After Shanxi Province began to implement the Ten-Year Construction Plan, Yan Xishan instructed several commissioners to hold meetings to study the matter of issuing property securities. This measure has also aroused the attention and questioning of public opinion circles across the country, and the meeting has repeatedly explained to dispel doubts. Recently, according to the final results of the research, Yan made a specific answer when a student asked him during a speech at the Shanxi Local Administrative Personnel Training Institute, saying, "Property securities can be implemented independently by the province in nature, but the province is inconvenient to implement independently in terms of political power, because property securities must be granted the status of legal currency by the central government in accordance with laws and regulations before they can be used as a medium of transaction and a measure of value. Since the province does not have this power, it is inconvenient for the province to implement it independently." According to this statement, this type of securities may only be used as research data and the issuance may be suspended. (Special Dispatch, 13th)</p>

<p>Washington: Washington officials claimed today that the issue of exchanging ambassadors between China and the United States is not being considered at this time. When asked how the United States would respond after China and Japan mutually upgraded their embassies, they replied that Italy had recently taken similar action, but the United States had not followed suit. However, according to well-informed sources, the United States will eventually appoint ambassadors to China, because Sino-American relations are traditionally strong, and since other countries have sent ambassadors, it would be below par for the American envoy to be outranked.

<p>Harbin Correspondence: Harbin's commerce has been in a state of decline for a long time. According to merchants, the reason is that the business is shouldering a heavy burden due to the harsh business taxes imposed by the puppet organization. In addition, the countryside is exhausted and purchasing power is weak. Various trade associations and chambers of commerce have repeatedly sent representatives to appeal to the puppet organization, but the puppet authorities have been whitewashing and delaying commercial relief due to competitive relations between Japan and the puppet organization, so that Japanese businesses can flourish. As a result, Chinese businesses that cannot sustain themselves are closing down daily. According to reliable surveys, in April alone, more than 50 companies under the jurisdiction of the Daowai Chamber of Commerce closed down. Among these 50-odd companies, Fuzengsheng, Qingfaxiang, and Erliang Rice Shops, and Gonghelong Bank are all old merchants in Harbin for many years. Not only do they have strong capital, but they also have close ties with various merchants. From this, it can be seen that the wounds of major merchants are all over their bodies, and the dangerous phenomenon will be fully exposed when the silver root is unusually tight in May. However, although 229 companies were opened in mid-April, these were all unemployed people who are suffering from the difficulty of finding a job due to the depression in the market and oversupply of labor. In order to make a living, they pooled extremely small amounts of capital to temporarily engage in business to meet their current needs. The weakness of their funds can be imagined, and the results will still be closure. (Northeast News Agency)</p>
<h3 id="e99">Financial Report for the Republic of China for the Fiscal Years 21 and 22 <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>(I) Introduction</p>
<p>The central financial report for years before the 21st year was compiled and submitted by former Minister Song. In October of the 22nd year, Xiangxi was ordered to succeed as the head of the Ministry of Finance. At that time, the 21st year had just ended, and the materials for various reports had not yet been collected. Due to the transition, there was not enough time to complete them. In January of the 23rd year, the Fourth Plenary Session of the Fourth Central Committee was held, and in December, the Fifth Plenary Session of the Fourth Central Committee was held. Xiangxi had successively prepared financial reports and submitted them for review. Now, a comprehensive compilation of the previous two reports has been made to form a detailed report for the 21st and 22nd fiscal years, along with a presentation of the general financial situation since the beginning of the 23rd year, as follows:</p>
<p>The first half of the 21st year coincided with the aftermath of the January 28th Incident. The national crisis was severe, and government officials worked diligently and cautiously, striving to economize on military and administrative expenses. At the same time, the people's patriotic fervor was also extremely strong. The government was able to revise the domestic debt repayment method, reduce the burden on the national treasury, and barely balance income and expenditure. By the spring and summer of the 22nd year, the suppression of bandits in Jiangxi Province was in full swing, and the situation in Yuyu and Rehe became critical, with martial law declared in Pingjin, resulting in huge expenditures for military provisions. As the military situation stabilized somewhat, there was a need for substantial relief funds for the war zones. After autumn, the Yellow River suffered a massive inundation, and the rebellion in Fujian Province followed. The raising of relief funds and the payment of military salaries were almost overwhelming. Therefore, the second half of the 21st year and the first half of the 22nd year were truly the most difficult periods for the national finances within the two fiscal years.</p>
<p>Fiscal revenue has always relied heavily on customs duties. Since the 20th year, the world economic panic has affected our country, with falling prices and rising silver prices affecting international trade. Customs revenue has therefore been reduced. In addition, the total loss of customs and salt taxes in the four northeastern provinces, as well as the need to find alternative ways to compensate for the portion of foreign debt originally secured by the tax revenues of those provinces, has further increased the burden of government debt.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the adoption of the gold unit for customs duties, the increase in import tax rates, and the improvement of financial and tax administration have prevented tax revenue from decreasing significantly. However, the increase in revenue from the above measures is far less than the previous losses.</p>
<p>Based on the above reasons, the government's financial deficit still had to be covered by borrowing. The amount borrowed in the 21st year was 86 million yuan, and the amount borrowed in the 22nd year was 147 million yuan. However, at the same time, debt was repaid, approximately 100 million yuan in the 21st year and approximately 115 million yuan in the 22nd year. In comparison, the amount borrowed was roughly offset by the amount repaid.</p>
<p>Looking back to the beginning of the 22nd year, the government could still make do with selling old bonds and borrowing temporary funds to cover the financial shortfall. However, by October of the 22nd year, as the need became more urgent and resources were exhausted, 100 million yuan in customs treasury bonds for the 22nd year were issued to facilitate turnover.</p>
<p>When Xiangxi took office, the finances were in a state of extreme exhaustion. Overall, the monthly deficit was often as high as 15 to 16 million yuan. At a time when military operations were in full swing and disaster victims were awaiting relief, it was impossible to reduce large expenditures and risk undermining the foundation. Therefore, efforts were made to reorganize tax revenues to increase the annual income. The tax rates on tobacco, cigarettes, matches, and cement were appropriately increased, and the customs duties on wheat flour, kerosene, gasoline, and other imported goods were appropriately revised. Import taxes on foreign rice and wheat were also implemented. At the same time, reforms were planned to increase revenue. However, the deficit was too large, and the increase in tax revenue could not be achieved overnight. Moreover, when the turmoil had just subsided, the financial situation was extremely tight, and stability in the market urgently needed to be addressed. In addition, the Central Bank had excessive thermal funds and should also find ways to repay them. Therefore, 100 million yuan in customs treasury bonds for the 23rd year were issued to repay advances and stabilize the financial situation.</p>
<p>Examining the total annual expenditure, military expenditure still accounted for the largest share, amounting to 321,000,000 yuan in the 21st year and 373,000,000 yuan in the 22nd year. However, the reason for the increase in these figures is that the scope of military expenditure included in the income and expenditure reports for this year was broader. For example, expenditures between various ministries and commissions that fell within the scope of military expenditure were mostly reported by this department during this period, and military expenditures from previous years that were gradually transferred during these two years were also included in the report. The amount of these supplementary items was 59 million yuan in the 21st year and 46 million yuan in the 22nd year. In addition, a portion of construction costs, such as the construction of roads in the bandit suppression areas and relief for rural villages, was also paid from the military expenditure item. From a practical perspective, the military expenditure for the two years has not exceeded previous years. This is because the military authorities have been considerate of the people's difficulties and have striven for frugality, enduring hardships and refraining from making excessive demands. Therefore, despite the successive events of suppressing rebellions and combating communism, the increase in military expenditure has been limited. Currently, the bandits' nests in Jiangxi Province have been destroyed and cleared, and the suppression of the part that fled to Sichuan and Guizhou is also progressing smoothly. If the bandit scourge can be eradicated at an early date, the reduction of military expenditure is a matter of course.</p>
<p>The rise and fall of the public debt market is enough to see the credit of the government and the safety of society. In the past two years, the prices of domestic and foreign debts have risen. From December 15th of the 21st year to February 25th of the 24th year, the 1913 Rehabilitation Loan bond in the London market has risen from 77 to 99.75. The 1898 loan bond has risen from 97.5 to 105, and the 1908 British-French loan bond has risen from 73 to 99.75. Although the situation of all domestic debts has been through two issues of treasury bonds, the market price has increased. This is because the government has reorganized old debts and carefully preserved the public debt fund, which has made the people at home and abroad increasingly trust the government.</p>
<p>However, during this period, the world economy was in turmoil, and our country could not be immune to the contraction of currency, the fall of prices, and the decline of industry and commerce, which all had a major impact on finances. In addition, foreign purchasing power was extremely weak, and various countries in the United Kingdom and the United States implemented national currency policies. The values of currencies such as the British pound, Japanese yen, and US dollar have depreciated, resulting in an increasing gold ratio of the Chinese silver dollar, and international trade has become more depressed.</p>
<p>In the autumn of the 23rd year, the domestic financial situation was tight. At that time, the United States Congress passed the Silver Purchase Act, and our country's domestic silver flowed out in a steady stream, and the number of exports was the largest in history. In order to protect domestic silver reserves and curb the rise in the price of national currency, the government had no choice but to increase the silver export tax and implement a balancing tax to regulate the situation. In recent months, silver exports have gradually decreased, and the market has stabilized. However, currency and finance are still serious problems in our country. The government is making every effort to plan various measures to rectify the financial situation, rescue the market, encourage production, and promote domestic goods in order to overcome the difficulties. The world is in the midst of turbulent waves, and we cannot but be terrified.</p>
<p>(II) Income and Expenditure</p>
<p>All expenditures in the 21st year were based on the budget for the 20th year. The general budget for the 22nd year was reviewed and compiled by the Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics, but the actual income and expenditure figures were based on the books of the Ministry of Finance. The following table lists the materials compiled based on the various pastoral expenditure reports received within the two years, and does not include all income and expenditure items that should be received and paid. Therefore, the figures in the table contain income and expenditure that belongs to previous years but was reported in the current year, and income and expenditure that was not reported in the current year will also be listed in the next year's table.</p>
<p>In addition, the Ministry had previously proposed a method for the central government agencies to manage income and expenditure, which should be handled uniformly by the national treasury, and submitted it for approval and implementation. Since its implementation in January of the 22nd year, a portion of the income and expenditure of the central government agencies has been included in the following table, which is more detailed than the income and expenditure table of previous years.</p>

<p>(III) Customs Duties</p>
<p>The level of customs duties is closely related to the livelihood of the people, and the government must take this into account. In May of the 22nd year, the import tariff regulations were revised, and the tax rates on textiles, paper, and fish and seafood products were slightly increased. In the winter of the same year, import taxes on rice and wheat were levied, and the import tax rate on wheat flour was increased to protect the interests of domestic farmers. In order to increase tax revenue, the tax rates on kerosene and gasoline were also slightly increased. By the end of the 22nd year, all import tariff regulations were revised again after considering the gains and losses. These new tariff regulations were implemented in July of the 23rd year.</p>
<p>The disaster relief surtax was originally set at 10% of the import and export tariff regulations. On August 1st of the 21st year, it was changed to 5%. In order to compensate for the annual budget, an additional 5% customs surtax was levied. The implementation period was initially set for one year and has now been extended to the end of June of the 24th year.</p>
<p>On April 6th of the 22nd year, an export tax of 2.25% ad valorem was levied on silver ingots, silver bars, and silver blocks. However, exports of factory bars and silver coins minted by the Central Mint were exempted. The 2.25% export tax rate is equal to the minting fee charged by the Central Mint for minting factory bars and silver coins, and is intended to use the tax rate to balance the national silver price. In October of the 23rd year, due to excessive outflow of silver, an export tax of 7.75% was levied on factory bars and silver coins from the 15th, and an export tax of 10% was levied on large silver bars and other silver categories. It was also stipulated that if the difference between the London silver price converted to the Shanghai exchange rate and the exchange rate determined on that day was insufficient to pay the above export tax, a balancing tax would be levied based on the insufficient amount. The details of the above two points are detailed in the Currency section.</p>
<p>The government originally planned to abolish all customs duties that impede domestic trade, such as re-import taxes, sub-port taxes, and inland regular customs duties. Since the 20th year, these have been gradually abolished. The re-export tax was intended to be abolished at the same time as the above taxes, but due to the sudden reduction of a large amount of revenue in finance, it was necessary to first find a way to compensate for it, so it was temporarily retained. It is still intended to be resolutely abolished in the shortest possible time. In the past year, the government has separately reduced or exempted various export and re-export taxes for goods transported abroad and domestically. For example, export taxes on peanuts, peanut kernels, peanut oil, eggs, and egg products were successively reduced in the 22nd and 23rd years. As for grains such as rice and wheat, which were previously subject to re-export taxes and prohibited from being exported, the ban was lifted from January of the 22nd year due to low prices and stagnant sales, and both export and re-export taxes were exempted. In June of the 23rd year, all export tariff regulations were revised again, mostly using lower tax rates, and more than 60 types were completely exempted. This year, it is planned to continue to appropriately reduce and exempt the majority. All of these are deeply rooted in the fact that export trade has plummeted in recent years, and rural villages in the country are on the verge of bankruptcy. Therefore, no effort has been spared to sacrifice huge amounts of tax revenue in order to save them.</p>
<p>With higher tax rates, tax evasion is even more difficult to avoid. Therefore, customs equipment has also been carefully reorganized to ensure strict prevention. Items such as adding patrol ships, increasing patrol teams, and establishing wireless communications have all been expanded. At the same time, the Customs Anti-Smuggling Regulations were promulgated, and customs posts were added at various land, sea, and air entry points to curb the source of smuggling. Although the trend of smuggling has not been completely suppressed in the past two years, the results of anti-smuggling have indeed been significant. According to customs investigations, some items that were previously mostly smuggled in are now taxed according to regulations.</p>
<p>After the abolition of taels and the adoption of yuan in the spring of the 22nd year, the customs taels used for export and re-export taxes were also abolished and replaced with silver standard currency. The weights and measures used for customs duties ad valorem were also adopted in February of the 23rd year using the new standard system.</p>
<p>The total amount of customs revenue (including import regular tax, export regular tax, re-import tax, inland sub-port tax, and ship tax, but excluding the disaster relief surtax and customs surtax) from the 1st year of the Republic of China to the 23rd year is listed in the table below.</p>
<p>Year Total Tax Revenue (Including Ship Tax)</p>
<p>Republic of China 1st Year National Currency 66,743,000 yuan</p>

<p>22nd Year 311,260,000 yuan</p>
<p>23rd Year 306,186,000 yuan</p>
<p>(Note 1) This table is calculated by converting one customs tael to 1.558 silver yuan, so it is slightly different from the figures listed in previous years' reports, which used 1.55 silver yuan per customs tael.</p>
<p>The above numbers do not include the various surtaxes levied. The following table lists the various customs revenue items for the most recent three years, along with the various surtaxes.</p>
<p>Republic of China 21st Year Republic of China 22nd Year Republic of China 23rd Year</p>
<p>(1932)  (1933)  (1934)</p>
<p>Import Tax 236,291,000 yuan 265,610,000 yuan 160,215,000 yuan</p>
<p>Export Tax 26,778,000 yuan 23,245,000 yuan 24,701,000 yuan</p>

<p>Ship Tax 4,267,000 yuan 4,402,000 yuan 4,302,000 yuan</p>
<p>Subtotal 287,888,000 yuan 311,260,000 yuan 306,286,000 yuan</p>
<p>Disaster Relief Surtax 19,022,000 yuan 14,136,000 yuan 14,242,000 yuan</p>
<p>Additional Tax 5,065,000 yuan 14,127,000 yuan 14,217,000 yuan</p>
<p>Total 31,975,000 yuan 339,523,000 yuan 334,645,000 yuan</p>
<p>The decline in customs revenue since the 20th year is mostly due to the decrease in the total value of imported goods. The total value of imports and exports in the 22nd year, excluding the four northeastern provinces, was only two-thirds of that in the 20th year. The total value of imports and exports in the 23rd year fell by 20% compared to the 22nd year. In addition, the prevalence of smuggling in South China and North China has also had some impact on the reduction of customs duties.</p>
<p>Another reason for the reduction in customs duties is the loss of customs duties in the four northeastern provinces. The customs revenue of the four provinces, including Dalian Customs, was nearly 40 million yuan according to the 20th year. This tax revenue has been completely lost, and the portion originally designated to guarantee foreign debt has also been lost, resulting in the government increasing its burden in addition to reducing revenue.</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>(IV) Salt Administration</p>
<p>During this period, the amount of salt tax revenue has increased significantly, and the administration of the salt administration has also striven to improve. The main points of its reforms are listed as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Merger of Institutions: The salt administration institutions in our country inherited the system of past dynasties, and the organization varied depending on local conditions. In order to concentrate power and save expenses, the government has appropriately merged them. Currently, the salt administration in various places has been mostly merged into the inspectorate for concurrent management.</p>
<p>(2) Elimination of Illegal Levies: Officials in various districts demanded illegal levies, which had been a long-standing practice, especially in the Yangtze River areas. Efforts have been made to eliminate them, so that the cost of salt merchants can be reduced.</p>
<p>(3) Reorganization of Tax Rates: The tax rates in various districts vary, and the burden is not evenly distributed, making smuggling more prevalent. In order to equalize taxes, the government implemented a preliminary reorganization of the salt-producing areas in July of the 21st year, and in October of the 22nd year, the sales areas were appropriately increased or decreased for the second reorganization. On January 1st of the 23rd year, an order was issued that the total amount of regular and additional taxes on salt should be limited to 10 yuan if it was between 10 yuan and 13 yuan, and an additional tax of 3 cents for foreign debt and 1 cent for salt field construction was added. For those below 10 yuan, improvements will be made gradually in the future after observing local conditions.</p>
<p>(4) Adoption of Standard Weights and Measures: On January 1st of the 23rd year, the Ministry ordered the adoption of the new metric system (one market dan equals 50 kilograms—110.23 pounds) to replace the local units that vary according to local customs.</p>
<p>(5) Construction of Warehouses and Fields: Salt fields are built in the producing areas for storage, and roads and ports are built to facilitate transportation, so that the salt produced can be quickly reached the storage area and it is easy to combat smuggling. This construction project has been gradually completed in the Huaibei and Changlu salt areas, and is now gradually being promoted in Shandong, Huainan, Zhejiang, Fujian, Guangdong and other regions.</p>
<p>(6) Construction of Storage Yards: It is planned to gradually build warehouses in the central salt sales areas, so that the salt from various places can be stored in them, so that the collection, transportation, sales, and collection of salt taxes can be facilitated.</p>
<p>(7) Reorganization of Tax Police: For the reorganization of tax police, the first step is to eliminate the old and weak, recruit elite troops, rectify discipline, and establish a tax police officer training school. Since its implementation, it has achieved good results. The salt tax in various districts across the country, except for the three northeastern provinces and the Koubei district, which are affected by special factors, is remitted on schedule for the amortization of foreign debt principal and interest funds. The salt tax allocated for the Hubei-Guangdong Railway loan even exceeds the amount that should be amortized according to the original contract and is sufficient to pay the full interest on the loan each year.</p>
<p>The following table lists the amount of salt tax revenue from the 2nd year of the Republic of China to the 22nd year:</p>

<h3 id="e100">Chen Jitang Detains Zhu Yuan - Zhu Zhuowen Executed in Zhongshan County - Yuan Dai Escorted to Guangzhou Awaiting Punishment <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>Guangzhou Dispatch: Zhu Zhuowen, a veteran member of the Kuomintang, was arrested in Zhongshan County by Liang Gongfu, the head of the Second Regiment of the Military Education Division, acting under the orders of Chen Jitang. The following night, Zhu was executed on the spot. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Earlier, Chen Jitang accused Zhu Zhuowen and Yuan Dai, an advisor to the First Group Army Headquarters, of organizing a militia and smuggling military equipment in Zhongshan County, plotting wrongdoing. Last month, he ordered Liang Gongfu's troops to station themselves in the area for strict surveillance and secretly instructed them to arrest Zhu and Yuan if necessary and send them to the province for interrogation. On the first of this month, he specially dispatched the Zhongkai warship to Shiqi to provide support and ordered Liang to immediately arrest Zhu and Yuan. After receiving the order, Liang ordered the officers and soldiers of the regiment to strengthen defenses day and night while dispatching dozens of capable secret agents to guard key locations in the town. He also devised a plan to lure Zhu into submission. On the sixth, Liang sent out invitations, inviting Zhu and others to a banquet at Zhang Tianji Restaurant in Shiqi at 6:00 PM that afternoon. At the same time, he ordered Deputy Regiment Commander Zhang to lead a company of soldiers, equipped with hand grenades and light machine guns, to set out from their garrison at the South Gate. They advanced along the streets in a "hornet formation", encircling the area. Upon reaching their destination, they ordered the soldiers to fix bayonets and stand guard on the main roads, as if facing a major enemy. At that time, all pedestrians and vehicles on the roads and streets of the town were temporarily forbidden from passing, and several light machine guns were set up at each intersection. The residents were bewildered and fled in panic, creating an atmosphere of fear and anxiety. Simultaneously, the shops in the town, thinking that a battle was about to break out, successively closed their gates. The prosperous commercial town was suddenly silent, like a ghost market. Around 6:00 PM, Zhu, accompanied by his attendant Dong Yuan, arrived as agreed, unaware of the trap. During the banquet, Wu Zhiqiang, the finance director during Liang Hongguang's tenure as county magistrate, Li Shaoqin, the chief of public security, Li Cheng, a provincial councilor (representing Zhongshan County), Zheng Zhongchu, the head of the Fourth District of the county, and Wu Ding and other local elders, totaling eight people, were also present. After several rounds of drinks, as the eighth dish was served, Liang Gongfu ordered the guards waiting at the door to go upstairs, raise their guns, and stand ready. He also ordered everyone at the table to stand up and raise their hands. The guards then detained Zhu. Seeing this, Zhu's attendant Dong Yuan tried to draw a pistol to resist, but he was discovered by the guards, who disarmed him and escorted Zhu to the regiment's office. Liang then showed Zhu Chen Jitang's secret order. Zhu remained silent. Subsequently, Li Shaoqin, Wu Zhiqiang, Li Cheng, former officials of the county, and local elders went to the Second Regiment headquarters to petition Liang Gongfu, requesting the release of Zhu Zhuowen. Liang replied that he was acting under the orders of his superiors and could not comply with their request. They returned empty-handed. After Zhu Zhuowen was arrested, Liang Gongfu sent a company of armed soldiers to the Yongle Hotel on Changdi Street in the town, surrounding it completely. Deputy Regiment Commander Zhang, along with the company commander and platoon leaders, prepared to resist arrest with gunfire. However, Yuan Dai, realizing the overwhelming odds, feared a massacre if they opened fire. He forbade the guards from firing and decided to wait for a resolution. Seeing that Yuan and his men did not resist, the officers and soldiers disarmed all the guards. Yuan Dai was then shackled and, along with three other people (names unknown), was taken to the Zhongkai warship and escorted to Guangzhou. Half an hour later, a large number of soldiers were dispatched to the second floor of the Yongle Hotel for a thorough search, apparently to capture remaining accomplices. However, Yuan's remaining associates had already fled upon hearing the news and could not be found.</p>
<p>After Liang Gongfu captured Zhu and Yuan, he posted a public notice around 11:00 PM that evening, stating: "By order of the Commander-in-Chief of the First Group Army: It has been reliably reported that Zhu Zhuowen, Director of the Construction Bureau of Zhongshan County, and Yuan Dai, Advisor to the Headquarters, are smuggling military equipment and organizing a militia in Zhongshan, plotting wrongdoing. The Regiment Commander is ordered to arrest them and send them to the Headquarters for disposition. Upon receipt of this order, it was found that the two rebels dared to smuggle military equipment and organize a militia in Zhongshan, endangering the local area, which is extremely unsupportable. The rebels were captured on the sixth and will be sent to the province for trial today. Since the ringleaders have been apprehended, the followers should be spared. All merchants and residents are hereby notified not to be alarmed. This notice."</p>
<p>After Yuan Dai was escorted to Guangzhou, he was interrogated by Li Jingxi, the chief of the military law department appointed by Chen Jitang, and then sent to the headquarters of the military police for detention. Zhu Zhuowen remained in Zhongshan County under the guard of Liang's regiment. Upon receiving the report, Chen Jitang sent He Luo, the chief of the public security bureau, to Zhongshan County on the seventh to interrogate Zhu, accusing him of ordering over ten thousand small, circular badges from a jewelry store on Hui'ai Road in Guangzhou. The first batch of the ordered badges were being investigated to determine their origin. Zhu denied any connection with the badges. However, at 3:00 AM that evening, Liang Gongfu, acting on Chen Jitang's orders, executed Zhu.</p>
<p>It is reported that after Zhu Zhuowen was detained, Zhu's confidants rushed to the province to seek his release. Zou Lu, a standing committee member of the Southwest Political Affairs Council, believed that Zhu had followed Sun Yat-sen in the revolution for decades and had contributed significantly to the party and the country. He sent a letter to Chen Jitang, requesting his release. Chen reportedly replied to Zou, stating that he had approved the request to transfer Zhu to the province for interrogation. Therefore, those who spoke for Zhu believed that if Chen allowed Zhu to be transferred to the province, there might be room for maneuver in the case. At the same time, influential figures also sent telegrams to Chen Jitang, asking him to consider Zhu's past contributions and grant his release. The telegrams arrived like snowflakes. However, Chen Jitang had already made up his mind to kill Zhu and specifically ordered Liang's regiment not to transfer Zhu to the province, precisely to avoid pleas from various parties.

<p>Li Yinfang, the magistrate of Jingjiang County, arrested Liu Jianfan, the editor of the Jingjiang Daily, because the newspaper published a short story titled "Injection," which he believed alluded to an affair between the magistrate and Ms. Zou Jinyong, the director of the obstetrics department of the smoking cessation hospital. Liu was detained in the local prison, subjected to illegal torture, and sentenced to one year and eight months of imprisonment. The newspaper was also forcibly ordered to cease publication. The newspaper has telegraphed various sectors for unanimous support. It is learned that Liu Zhengmin and 30 other fellow townsmen of Jingjiang traveling together, believe that the aforementioned report did not contain transgressive language, and that the magistrate had illegally arrested the reporter and ordered the paper to cease publication, abusing his authority. Such trampling on human rights and suppressing public opinion is extremely unlawful. Yesterday, they jointly telegraphed Chen Guofu, chairman of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, Yu Jingtang, director of the Department of Civil Affairs, and the Provincial Party Headquarters, requesting that they be severely punished according to the law to uphold public opinion and protect human rights.</p>

<p>Zheng Yitong, the administrative inspector of the Nantong District, stated that two sessions of the training class for township heads of the six counties under the district, including Tong, Ru, Chong, Hai, Jing, and Qi, have already been held. He has now found that there are still people who are required to receive training according to the regulations and will continue to open the third session. Classes will begin on the 20th, with each person required to pay 30 yuan. If they continue to refuse under false pretenses, the county government will enforce it.</p>

<p>The home of Wu Zhongying, an executive committee member of the County Party Committee, located in Dongjing Town, Third District, was robbed by more than 20 bandits around 3:00 AM the night before. They traveled for an hour to reach Wu's home and began the robbery. They bound Wu's uncle, Xiaotao, and other village officials with bedding before plundering the house. As a result, more than 50 silver dollars were stolen. They then went to the lower room to find the family of Wu's father. Wu's father was lucky enough to escape early and was not harmed, but all important valuables were looted. At the same time, the home of farmer Dai Shijin in Xiangjing, about seven or eight miles away, was also robbed. Dai was stabbed twice and seriously injured in the waist. Reports have been filed with the Public Security Bureau for arrest.</p>
<h3 id="e104">Jiashan: Citywide Strike Calmed <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>The strike by merchants and residents in the urban and rural areas of this county due to the county government's moving of puppets late at night has been reported in various newspapers, but none have been detailed. It has been learned that the county government issued a seal on all temples in the city on the 3rd of this month and announced martial law on the 5th, with a complete police cordon and armed defense. However, there were still rumors of a temple fair on the 11th. The county government secretly ordered police officers, patrol teams, and the security corps to hire several large boats in the middle of the night on the 11th and transport all 13 puppets from the city to the Yasheng Temple. In addition to sealing the temple doors, police were stationed to guard it. The next morning, residents outside the East Gate heard the news and convened an emergency meeting. Starting from the Jiashan Oil Factory near the Sunjiaqiao bridge, thousands of people went door-to-door to spread the word of a strike. Within an hour, all shops in the city had completely closed. The Public Security Bureau, upon hearing the news, sent the section chief and inspectors to dissuade the crowd together with the head of the security corps, but to no avail. The county government immediately convened an emergency meeting to discuss countermeasures. Police officers with live ammunition were stationed in front of the county government, the Public Security Bureau, and the headquarters of the security corps. The streets were crowded with pedestrians, and the atmosphere was extremely tense. Shen Jiren, a standing committee member of the County Party Committee, feared that the situation would escalate and decided to resolve it peacefully. He persuaded both sides not to push for a break. The heads of each community then ordered each village to guide the people into the city and return the idols one by one. They agreed to allow each temple to operate, as a condition for mediation. Therefore, all shops in the city have resumed business today. However, whether or not the temple fair will be held is still undecided.</p>

<p>The Shenshi News Agency reports that Feng Rui, director of the Department of Agriculture and Forestry of Guangdong Province, arrived in Shanghai at 10:30 AM yesterday aboard the President McKinley to establish a water conservancy and reclamation company. A reporter from the Shenshi News Agency interviewed Mr. Feng at his residence and learned the following details:</p>
<p>The Four Banks Invest in the Water Conservancy Company</p>
<p>In order to revitalize the rural areas and promote development, Guangdong Province plans to establish a water conservancy and reclamation company. The government will subscribe to 3 million yuan of shares. While in Guangdong, I repeatedly telegraphed the Shanghai banking community to discuss the matter. I also consulted with the various branches of Shanghai banks in Guangdong. Yang Zhuo'an, director of the Department of Industry and Commerce of Guangxi Province, came to Shanghai and was specifically instructed to meet with the banks in Shanghai. Therefore, the matter is largely settled. The investing banks are the Central Bank, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Shanghai Bank. My purpose in coming here is to discuss the distribution of the funds in detail and sign a contract.</p>
<p>Proceeding with Loan for Guangdong's Sugar Industry</p>
<p>The water conservancy company will have nine directors, five from the banking sector and four from the government. The directors appointed by the government will be approved by the banking sector. Therefore, the company is primarily controlled by the banking sector. The 3 million yuan to be borne by the Guangdong Provincial Government has already been raised. Once the investment contract is signed with the banking sector, the company can be established. In addition, Guangdong's sugar production has recently seen considerable development, and sugar factories are also thriving. However, to compete with foreign sugar, it is still necessary to invest a large amount of capital and strive for production. I will also take this opportunity to discuss the sugar industry with the Shanghai banking community. I plan to visit the leaders of the four banks tomorrow (today) and go to Nanjing within a few days to make a presentation to the central government, he said.</p>
<h3 id="e108">Mayor Wu Advocates Combining Education and Entertainment - Plans to Establish Shanghai City Day and Create City Song - Reports Significance at Municipal Government Memorial Week Yesterday - Promoting New Movement to Advance Municipal Social Construction <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>The Central News Agency reports that in order to promote the New Life Movement and advance municipal social construction, Mayor Wu has advocated establishing a day as the municipal festival and creating a Shanghai city song. He reported the significance of the proposed Shanghai City Day and the creation of a Shanghai city song at the Municipal Government Memorial Week yesterday. His words were quite earnest. The original text is as follows: Fellow comrades, the purpose of my report today is to suggest to the citizens of Shanghai that we establish a day as Shanghai City Day and create a Shanghai city song. On the one hand, I want to explain my ideas, and on the other hand, I want to solicit the opinions of all citizens. The direction of the Shanghai Municipal Government's efforts this year has been determined as social construction. Therefore, this year is the Shanghai Municipal Government's Social Construction Year. On the one hand, we want all municipal government employees to work in this direction, and on the other hand, we want to awaken all citizens of Shanghai to support the municipal government and cooperate with the municipal government to complete the various undertakings planned for our Social Construction Year. We must know that social construction is different from other types of construction. Other types of construction mostly focus on material aspects, while social construction must also focus on spiritual aspects. All municipal government employees and citizens of Shanghai should not overlook this important point in the course of our efforts in municipal social construction. On the negative side, we must transform customs, and on the positive side, we must build our spirit. In the process of national revolution, in the construction of a new China, and in the progress of the Chinese national revival movement, we must find ways to eliminate all obstacles, both tangible and intangible, that currently hinder the national revolution, hinder the construction of a new China, and hinder the revival of the Chinese nation. This work is our most urgent task at present. The so-called intangible obstacles are more powerful than tangible obstacles. For example, customs have a historical background and have been passed down for thousands of years. They have a great controlling power over the psychology of the general public. However, many customs are good, and many violate the spirit of the times. We must of course preserve good customs. We must not only preserve them but also promote and develop them. However, we must find ways to improve or even eliminate those customs that violate the spirit of the times and hinder social progress. This is an important work that we must strive to fight for when the old and new clash. Because each era has its own spirit and needs, many of the customs passed down in China for thousands of years are no longer in line with the spirit and needs of the current era. These customs that violate the spirit and needs of the times are intangible obstacles that hinder social progress and the construction of a new China. We should improve or eliminate them. Everyone must recognize that now is an era of scientific omnipotence, now is an era of human power over nature. We must exert human power to survive, which is in line with the modern spirit. However, many of our customs are contrary to the modern spirit. The most obvious examples are seeking divine guidance, temple fairs, burning incense, and dispensing free meals to the gods, etc., all kinds of unconscious actions. For example, a few weeks ago, it was reported that the people of Luodian in Jiading County dispensed free meals to the gods, praying for divine blessings and disaster relief. A few weeks ago, a temple fair was held in Jiaxing. The government prohibited it, resulting in a strike. Also, a few weeks ago, temple fairs were held in Pudong and Jiangwan. Although the situation this year was slightly better than in previous years due to the city government's efforts to prohibit them in advance, these unconscious actions and customs that violate the spirit of the times are still prevalent and still have great social potential. We must use political power to prohibit them and lead the people to take a very rational path that is in line with the spirit of the times. The construction movement of our new China has been underway for more than 50 years, and the national revolution led by our party's founder has also been underway for more than 50 years. However, to this day, most people still follow the old forces and live in the old thinking. If we do not destroy these old forces and old thinking, what methods can we use to build a new China and revive the Chinese nation? Chiang Kai-shek, in view of this, deeply knows that revolution must first revolutionize the heart, and change must first change customs. Therefore, he wants to promote the New Life Movement, because the way of life is most closely related to social progress. A bad way of life will of course only create a bad society. This is a certain truth. If the way of life cannot be improved, then our society cannot be improved. Therefore, Chiang Kai-shek wants to promote the New Life Movement and instruct local governments, local party departments, national civil servants, and national Kuomintang comrades to use political power and persuasive methods to promote the New Life Movement. If we want the national revolution to succeed thoroughly, we must first transform the lives of the people throughout the country. If we want to transform the lives of the people, we must first eliminate all bad customs that violate the spirit of the times. Therefore, the most important task of our New Life Movement is to transform customs. However, to transform the Chinese society, which is deeply rooted and has the deepest historical teachings, in addition to using political power, we must also use social education methods to guide the situation. And the best way to guide the situation is to combine education and entertainment. Therefore, we want the Shanghai Municipal Government to advocate that a day be set as Shanghai City Day, so that millions of people in the city, regardless of social status, men and women, old and young, rich and poor, can all enjoy a day of common joy and happiness every year, which is the so-called public entertainment. We must have various meanings and messages incorporated into the forms of entertainment on this day, such as encouraging agriculture, encouraging learning, encouraging industry, encouraging commerce, and promoting diligence and thrift, so that citizens throughout the city can stimulate their passionate emotions, lively spirits, and noble meanings and sound thinking in the midst of the excitement of Shanghai City Day, thereby creating a new atmosphere in the city. At the same time, we also want to create a Shanghai city song. This song should be very popular so that everyone in the city can sing it. The content should also carry the consciousness of encouraging agriculture, encouraging industry, encouraging learning, encouraging commerce, and promoting diligence and thrift, in order to eliminate the decadent music of the city and cultivate the healthy temperament of citizens. In short, we want to gradually transform those customs that violate the spirit of the times through this joyful festival and this song. At the same time, we also want to take this opportunity to create a new custom to inspire the noble aspirations and lively spirits of the citizens throughout the city. This is an important work in the social construction of the city. This method of advocating local festivals is not an innovation. All countries and regions have local festivals, the so-called Carnival. Various regions of our country also have their own festivals. I am only improving them according to the spirit of the times and the needs of the environment. When we talk about Shanghai in Shanghai, we must preserve and promote the good customs of Shanghai. However, we must also find ways to improve all customs in Shanghai that violate the spirit of the times. We see that the citizens of Shanghai today simply do not have a day of common joy and happiness in the 365 days of the year. In the past, during the lunar new year, everyone, regardless of social status, men and women, old and young, rich and poor, and even those in debt, was happy. Now the lunar calendar has been abolished and the solar calendar has been adopted. However, the solar calendar has not yet been popularized. Only a few people are following the solar calendar, and most people do not know how to use it. Therefore, the kind of excitement and joyful emotions during the solar new year is of course not possible. And the weekly holiday is still a new system. Except for national administrative agencies and a few banks and factories that implement the weekly holiday system, other places have not yet popularized it. Even if it is popularized, it still cannot make the public happy together. Even on National Day, October 10th, people do not seem very happy. We see how happy and joyful the people of other countries are on their National Days. How widespread is it? But the people of our country are still indifferent to National Day and of course there is nothing happy to say. One reason is that the time is too short, and there have been various changes in between. Another reason is that we are now in a time of national crisis and seem to have no intention of celebrating National Day. Therefore, when we talk about Shanghai in Shanghai, we really cannot find a day that can make all the citizens of Shanghai happy together, and we cannot find a day for conscious entertainment. No wonder most citizens throughout the city frown every day and are troubled and annoyed. On the one hand, people who are lazy by nature are indulging in improper entertainment every day or even at every moment. Under such circumstances, what methods can we use to awaken the passionate emotions of the citizens? And what methods can we use to inspire the lively spirits of the citizens? If this continues, those strange phenomena and customs such as temple fairs and burning incense can only exist every day and become more widespread every day. This will not only hinder the progress of the construction of a new China and the revival of the Chinese nation, but the people's morale will also decline day by day, to the point where it is beyond remedy in the future. The danger ahead is truly unimaginable. Therefore, based on the principles of the New Life Movement, the principle of revolutionizing the heart before revolutionizing the government, and the principle of transforming customs, we must preserve and promote the good customs of Shanghai. As for all the customs that violate the spirit of the times, we must distinguish between the priorities and transform them step by step. The method of transformation is to "combine education and entertainment" and lead the citizens throughout the city to engage in common entertainment. Set a Shanghai City Day so that all citizens, regardless of gender, age, wealth, or poverty, can come together to enjoy entertainment on this day. During the entertainment, promote the spirit of encouraging agriculture, encouraging industry, encouraging learning, encouraging commerce, as well as thrift and reading, so that entertainment becomes meaningful, popular, socialized, and educational. At the same time, we must also create a Shanghai city song for all citizens to sing, so that the decadent music that permeates the city can be changed, the enthusiastic emotions of the citizens throughout the city can be awakened, and the depressed and troubled society can be transformed into a lively and happy society. A city full of such passionate and happy emotions can prosper and develop. By extension, if a nation is full of such passionate and happy emotions, it can transform the conservative and decadent national character, develop social activity, and increase national sympathy. In this way, there will naturally be hope for revival, and so on.</p>

<p>The Central News Agency reports that President Wang of the Executive Yuan has been slightly ill with a cold in Nanjing since the 7th. He did not pay attention to it at the time and continued to handle official duties despite his illness. He then followed the doctor's advice and began to rest quietly at his private residence on the 12th to facilitate his early recovery. It has been learned that Dr. Noel, a well-known German doctor in this city, has been summoned by President Wang and took the night express train from Shanghai to Nanjing on the evening of the 12th to diagnose Wang's illness and examine his health. He will return to Shanghai after Wang's health recovers, it is said.</p>

<p>Marshal Józef Piłsudski, the founding hero of Poland and Minister of Military Affairs, passed away at 8:45 PM on the 12th (previous day) at Belvedere Palace in Warsaw due to illness, at the age of 68. Poland has lost its sole leader, a truly significant loss. The Polish Consulate in this city received the telegram officially yesterday morning at 11:00 AM and immediately flew the flag at half-mast in silent mourning. Polish Minister Wędtowski and Polish expatriates in Shanghai will hold a memorial service and prayer service. The original telegram was in French, translated as follows: General Józef Piłsudski, the first marshal of Poland, passed away due to illness at Belvedere Palace in Warsaw on the 12th of this month at 8:45 PM. General Piłsudski had been ill for several months. Professors Wenka Bell and Stevens diagnosed the general's illness as cancer of the liver and stomach. Famous military and civilian doctors worked together to treat him, but without success. By May 11th, the illness became critical, with internal bleeding causing the heart to weaken, ultimately leading to his demise. Piłsudski was born on December 5, 1867, and was 68 years old. He studied medicine at a Russian university. At that time, Poland suffered the pain of being partitioned. Piłsudski dedicated himself to revolutionary work, fighting against the Tsarist Russian government. He was arrested repeatedly but never ceased his revolutionary work. He was once exiled to Siberia for five years. During the European War, Piłsudski secretly organized volunteer armies in Poland to resist Russia. More and more people joined, and the momentum grew, fighting for Poland's independence and winning repeated victories. In 1917, Piłsudski was imprisoned by the German government in a military prison. The following year, the Great War ended, and Piłsudski was freed. Poland finally achieved independence through Piłsudski's efforts. An interim government was established, and he was elected as its leader. When the formal constitution was completed, although he was elected as the first president, he firmly declined and retired to the post of Minister of Military Affairs, where he remained until now. In 1920, he repelled the Russian army invading Poland, further enhancing his reputation. He was undoubtedly a national hero.</p>

<p>Expires in March Next Year</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council Agreement was signed in Nanjing on February 17, 1930, by Xu Mo, representative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Dias, Chargé d'Affaires of Brazil in China, Jacob, Minister of the United States in China, Hurley, Minister of Great Britain in China, Gronwald, Chargé d'Affaires of Norway in China, and Herlongmen, Chargé d'Affaires of the Netherlands in China. It came into effect on April 1 of the same year. According to Article 10 of the agreement, the validity period is three years. After it expired at the end of March 1933, it was extended for another two years with the consent of both parties. It is expected to expire at the end of March next year.</p>
<p>Must Be Revised</p>
<p>Legal circles in this city believe that the provisions of the agreement must be revised after this term expires. There are ten articles and eight attachments in the agreement, and many points should be revised. The most notable are: (1) the issue of jurisdiction; (2) the issue of police dispatch. The prosecutor of the Shanghai Municipal Council Court is limited by the provisions of the agreement, and has very little jurisdiction. All public prosecution matters are handled by the police. The selection of judicial police is not directly assigned by the president of the court, but the police recommend candidates, and then the president of the court assigns them.</p>
<p>Judicial Yuan Pays Close Attention</p>
<p>Judicial circles in this city generally believe that the organization of the Shanghai Municipal Council Court is different from that of courts in other regions. Therefore, after the expiration of the agreement, it must be revised to be the same as courts in other regions. It is also known that the Ministry of Justice is paying close attention to this matter and has begun to organize a Legal Rights Research Committee, which will be established soon. The issue of recovering consular jurisdiction will be studied by the committee.</p>
<p>Some Foreigners' Wild Ideas</p>
<p>Recently, some foreigners in this city have suggested establishing an international arbitration court to handle foreign-related litigation. The judicial circles expressed indignation at this. At a time when China is actively recovering consular jurisdiction, there should be no such attempts to undermine the integrity of China's legal rights. It is also known that this suggestion is the wild idea of a few foreigners and will definitely not be realized.</p>

<p>According to the Guowen News Agency, the China National Aviation Corporation's giant Ford aircraft, piloted by pilot Lyle Sonn and co-pilot Wang Guanyue, flew to Chongqing as early as March 25 to conduct a trial flight to Kunming. Mr. Nie Kaiyi, deputy director of the aviation team who accompanied the plane, returned to Shanghai yesterday. According to him, the section from Chongqing to Guiyang can be flown every day, but the section from Guiyang to Kunming is mountainous, with low clouds and continuous rain, making it impossible to fly over. Therefore, it was not until May 4 that the flight from Chongqing to Guiyang arrived in Kunming, and the trial flight procedures were completed. Currently, pilots Lyle Sonn and Wang Guanyue, as well as radio operator Luo Zhaoming and mechanic La'an, are continuing to conduct trial flights when the weather is clear, in order to familiarize themselves with the route. I have returned to Shanghai and reported the trial flight process to the company authorities and the Ministry of Transportation, requesting them to consider the situation, set the schedule, and announce the official opening.</p>

<h3 id="e114">Cooperation Between National Products Production and Sales; Plans to Establish National Products United Business Office; Business and Industrial Circles Discuss Implementation Methods <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>In order to develop national products and seek genuine cooperation between production and sales, the China National Products Production and Sales Company and the Shanghai National Products Company plan to organize the Shanghai Chinese National Products United Business Office and the China National Products Production and Sales Promotion Committees, and organize a national products auction market within the business office. Yesterday at 6:00 PM, they hosted a banquet at Guanshengyuan on Nanjing Road, inviting business and industrial circles in this city to discuss implementation methods. Details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Factories Attending Yesterday The factories attending included: Yabuer Electric Appliance Factory, Tiger Balm Shui'antang, Yonghe Industrial Company, Yifeng Enamel Factory, China Educational Toy Factory, Lianhua Woolen Factory, Xin Xin Toothbrush Factory, Tongyu Industrial Society, Yizhong Knitting Factory, Fuhua Towel Factory, Beiyang Liaqi Factory, Zhou Dexing, Litai Factory, Tian Xiecheng Ivory Factory, Baili Cosmetics Company, Ruitai Xiang Porcelain Factory, China Piano Factory, Puqiu Industrial Society, Central Soap Factory, Dean Clock Factory, Qingdao Yaxin Button Factory, Tianjin Dongya Woolen Factory, Zhenkang Factory, Yongda Stove Factory, Liuhe Sai Luo Factory, Guanghua and Huaxiang Hat Factory, Xiechang Glass Factory, Dazhong Yang Factory, Xiangmin Factory, Tong Baoquan Factory, Zhi Jing Factory, Meihua Art Company, Huamin Toy Company, Modern Craft Society, Hongji Industrial Society, Friendship Shoe Factory, Xinguang Thermos Factory, China Lock Factory, Zhixin Umbrella Factory, Wang Hongjiang Camp Bed Factory, Sanyuan Industrial Company, Ren Wanxing Bakelite Manufacturing Factory, Hanyang Industrial Factory, Fuxing Paper Umbrella Factory, Fumin Underwear Factory, Baoda Pa Factory, Xiangtai and Huali Weaving Factory, Chen Yuji, Xiecheng National Products Store, Meihua Chunyu Li Knitting Factory, Jinle Factory, Wang Hongji Daya Factory, Huaxing Industrial Factory, Fukang Company, Wanheng Iron Factory, and more than 100 other companies.</p>
<p>Cooperation Plan First, a representative of the production and sales company gave a speech, stating that since January 28, more than three years have passed, and the damage suffered by our country is becoming more and more pressing. Try to prove how the market situation was the year before last compared to last year, and how last year compared to this year. In short, things are getting worse and worse, reaching a critical point. Today, our country's economic environment is so tight, and the economic aggression of foreigners is advancing so aggressively. If we do not immediately unite and save ourselves, I am afraid that in the future, we will not be able to unite and will not be able to save ourselves. The pain in this is beyond description by pen and ink. I only hope that the national product production and sales parties will meet each other with loyalty and righteousness, and the problem of uniting and saving ourselves can be solved. From the beginning of the establishment of this company, the original purpose was to promote national products, promote sales of national products, and publicize and persuade our compatriots to reject foreign goods and buy national products. Therefore, we spared no great sacrifice and expressed the spirit of not turning back despite hundreds of setbacks to deal with the bad environment. Now, based on the original intention, we make further contributions and respectfully submit the following plan, hoping to be appreciated and work together. (1) It is proposed to organize the Shanghai National Product Factory United Business Office, concentrating national product factories from this city and other cities in one place, and fully display the products of each factory in one place, so as to facilitate the wholesale purchase of national products by business circles from this city and other provinces. The proposed location is on the second floor of the Shanghai National Products Company and the second floor of the China National Products Production and Sales United Company. (2) Organize the China National Products Production Committee, the charter will be determined separately, and representatives of Shanghai factories will join the organization. (3) Organize the China National Products Sales Promotion Committee, the charter will be determined separately, and invite the standing directors and purchasing directors of each company to organize it. (4) Establish a national product auction market in the former idle business office to separately specify the sale of each factory's products, so as to arouse the national sentiment of using national products. (5) Establish a special contract management department in the former production committee or wholesale committee to be responsible, which can facilitate its ability to improve production and promote popular sales. The above points are brief contributions. In short, the national product industry in our country is in a dangerous situation today and should earnestly unite, first seek a way to save ourselves, and then plan to resist foreign aggression, so as to fulfill our industrial responsibility to save the country. May we rise together and plan for it. Zhang Guoquan, general manager of China Enterprise Company, said in his speech that our country's industry has never had an organizational foundation from the beginning. After January 28, the social economy was extremely panic. In addition, foreign goods were overproduced and inflation occurred. Due to the increase in silver prices, a large number of commodities were exported at low exchange rates, and dumping was carried out. Our national product factories did not dare to ask the government for assistance, nor did they rely on any economic power. They all emerged to fight automatically. Now, Mr. Wu Zhihao is enthusiastic about saving the country, advocating industry, adopting simple methods, concentrating organizations, and organizing a joint business office of various factories in order to promote the sales of national products and achieve the hope of industrial salvation. All our national product factories unanimously agree, and it is heard that Mr. Wu's Ningbo Industrial Bank undertakes national product warehouses, national product markets, and national product mobile pawnshops, which can provide our industrial circles with genuine cooperation and assist in production, which is even more gratifying.</p>

<p>According to the Shiye News Agency, the Shanghai Overseas Chinese Federation sent letters yesterday to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Bankers' Association, the China Cultural Construction Association, the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, the National Products Factory Federation, the China National Industrial Foreign Trade Association, the Rice Industry Association, the Miscellaneous Grain Association, the Journalists' Association, the Daily Newspaper Association, the Guangdong Natives Association in Shanghai, the Chaozhou Natives Association in Shanghai, the Federation of Trade Unions, the Wharf Association, the Women's Association, the Joint Association of Faculty and Staff of Various Universities, the Joint Association of Various Universities, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Wharf Workers' Union, the Freight Forwarding and Customs Brokerage Association, Quanzhang, and other dozens of groups. The original letter said, "We are writing to inform you that the Siamese government's promulgation of compulsory education and commercial regulations for the management of industry and commerce severely oppresses overseas Chinese, causing national outrage. This matter is not only a fatal blow to the two million overseas Chinese in Siam, but also of no small importance to the future of our nation. Our association has repeatedly received petitions for assistance from representatives of overseas Chinese in Siam and has unanimously expressed its support. However, this matter is of great importance, and unless we pool our wisdom and devise effective measures, it may be difficult to achieve the goal of relief. We have decided to hold a discussion meeting on the 18th of this month at 1:00 PM on the ninth floor of the Eight Immortals Temple Youth Association, inviting various social organizations to discuss concrete response measures. As this matter concerns the survival of the nation, we hope that your association will send a representative to attend and jointly discuss all matters. Sincerely yours."</p>

<p>Mr. Zhang Fakui, member of the Central Executive Committee and former commander of the Fourth Army, returned from a tour of Europe and the United States last month and once visited Beijing and Hangzhou. Mr. Zhang is still residing in Shanghai and has no intention of leaving for the time being. As a result of Mr. Zhang's inspection of Europe and the United States, he deeply felt that the material civilization and industrial progress of those countries had much to learn from and refer to for our countrymen. Moreover, the backwardness and immaturity of our country's industry today must be urgently caught up. Therefore, after Mr. Zhang returned to Shanghai from Beijing and Hangzhou, he thought of inspecting the maritime industry situation. Yesterday, Mr. Zhang, accompanied by his secretary Hua Yuegao and friends Mr. Zou Shuchu, and also accompanied by Mr. Liang Bozhi of Liang Xinji Toothbrush Factory, first visited the factory. On that day, Mr. Liang Risheng, general manager of the factory, and manager Chen Bingxia cordially received them and guided them to visit the working conditions of various departments in detail. Mr. Zhang greatly praised the achievements of the factory's products. After the visit, they had refreshments and talked about his experiences in Europe and the United States until about 5:00 PM before taking their leave. Because of his convenience of staying in Shanghai, Mr. Zhang also plans to visit Kangyuan Canning Factory, Guanshengyuan Food Factory, Mabao Mountain Biscuit Factory, and Meiya Silk Weaving Factory in the coming days.</p>

<p>The Shanghai-Nanjing-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Trade Union, due to its imperfect organization, was approved by the Special Party Department of the railway to send personnel to reorganize it. Now that its subordinate branch unions have been established one after another and the reorganization work has been completed, the Special Party Department has reported the situation to the Central Committee and the Trade Union Reorganization Office has decided to convene a representative meeting. After the Central Mass Movement Guidance Committee reported it, it sent Wu Lanxi, the chief of the Workers' Section, to inspect the two railways. Mr. Wu first went to Zhenjiang, Changzhou, Suzhou, Jiashan, Zhabei, and Wusong to examine the reorganization process in detail. The overall work has been completed. On the night of the 12th, he came to Shanghai from Hangzhou by train. Yesterday (the 13th) at noon, he went to the Special Party Department and talked with Chen Chengshi, Li Dasan, Song Chuanji, director of the Workers' Section Chen Pin, trade union organizers Xue Jie, Pan Xiangqin, and general manager Yang Youren. According to Mr. Wu, the results of this inspection show that the members of the trade unions on the two railways are all workers and their elements are pure, ranking first among the railway trade unions in the country.

<h3 id="e121">Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Finance Announces the Names of Foreigners Who Have Not Paid Land Value Tax <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>Foreign nationals from certain countries have not paid land value tax on their perpetual lease land in the city. It is reported that the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Finance has issued a notice to these foreign nationals, as follows: It is found that the city's collection of provisional land value tax is in accordance with the regulations promulgated by the central government. All land within the area designated for the collection of provisional land value tax in the city, whether it is perpetual lease land or land with land certificates, must pay taxes in accordance with the regulations. The tax period is divided into two installments each year. The first installment started on August 1, 1933, and has now reached the fourth installment. The estimated land value is based on the assessment of the Estimation Committee organized in accordance with the regulations. The committee consists of nine members, including four famous figures from the business community, who are very familiar with the real estate situation. Mr. Gui Yanfang, chairman of the Chinese Real Estate Association, is one of them. Therefore, the estimated land value is very fair. Compared with the actual value, it is reduced by an average of about 55%, and the tax rate is set at 6 per thousand per year, which is also a light tax. Moreover, there is no discrimination based on national boundaries, and it is collected uniformly. Moreover, the landowners in the city enjoy great benefits on their land, but there are no taxes on these benefits. Landowners should enthusiastically pay the small amount of land value tax currently collected in the city to fulfill their obligations. It is found that the household's registered number is , the land value tax for the second installment of the perpetual lease land for 1933, 1934, and 1935 is a total of ocean yuan, jiao, fen. The Bureau has previously issued tax notices with serial numbers such as Di, Tian, Yuan, and Huang to the household, but no payment has been made, which is not in accordance with the regulations. It is the duty of the Bureau to notify and urge the tax defaulters to pay the tax, and it has also notified the Land Bureau that when perpetual lease land or land with land certificates that has not paid land value tax is transferred, no transfer will be allowed to restrict it. Moreover, Articles 8 of the Provisional Regulations on the Collection of Land Value Tax and Article 14 of the Implementing Rules stipulate that "If the taxpayer fails to pay the tax in accordance with the regulations within the prescribed time limit, he may be summoned to recover the tax arrears and shall be charged annual interest on the tax arrears, and may also extract the income from the land and its fixtures based on the number of years of arrears, and may submit it to the municipal government for approval to auction the land and its fixtures to offset the tax arrears, as well as the annual interest to be charged." This is a point that taxpayers should pay special attention to. This notice is hereby given, and it is hoped that you will check and pay the tax as soon as possible to avoid being punished in accordance with the regulations. To the owners of the land, Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Finance.</p>
<h3 id="e122">Real Estate Merchants Abandon Plan to Issue Circulating Vouchers; Planning Other Methods to Save the Real Estate Business <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>In order to circulate real estate funds, real estate merchants in this city previously planned to request the government to approve the issuance of 50 million yuan of real estate circulating vouchers. Due to practical difficulties, it was not approved by the government and the banking community. Subsequently, real estate merchants held several meetings to discuss everything. The issuance of the so-called circulating vouchers may not only fail to increase circulation efficiency in practice, but also be unable to be cashed, which would disrupt finance. Therefore, the original proposal has been abandoned. Other methods are now being planned to save the stagnation of the real estate business.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday submitted to the Ministries of Finance and Industry a request to promote the acceptance of bills of exchange. The report stated that, according to the suggestion of Supervising Committee member Luo Qinghua, in order to promote commercial acceptance bills, it is proposed to organize lecture meetings, invite economic experts to give lectures in turn, and request the government to issue a clear order to promote it, so as to achieve practical results. It is found that the above-mentioned proposal for promoting commercial acceptance bills includes (1) organizing lecture meetings and (2) requesting the government to issue a clear order to promote it. The 42nd and 43rd standing meetings of the association resolved to approve it. The organization of the lecture meetings should be held immediately, and Committee member Luo Qinghua was recommended as the director to preside over the handling. The request to the government to issue a clear order to promote it concerns the reform of the credit system. In today's economically exhausted situation, this method is a unique tool to increase payment. However, at the beginning of the implementation, unless the government authorities advocate it, it will be difficult to promote it to the fullest extent. Therefore, we are submitting a document together with a copy of the Shanghai Silk Industry Association's Origins of Commercial Acceptance Bills, requesting your department to approve it and promote it to the provincial and municipal governments to benefit the business community. This is for public convenience.</p>

<p>The low-pressure wind that originated within our country's borders affected this city when it entered the sea the day before yesterday morning. Therefore, the city experienced a fierce wind attack at around 3 AM on that day. However, according to the observatory report, the typhoon situation is still the most significant. The wind has now entered the Sea of Japan, located between 135 degrees east longitude and 40 degrees north latitude. According to the person in charge of the observatory, speaking to a reporter from the Dagong Society, "Depression" should be translated as "low-pressure wind" because low pressure is also a type of hurricane. Otherwise, outsiders may not understand. A hurricane that originates on land is called a low-pressure wind in astronomy. Therefore, hurricanes and low-pressure winds are both strong winds, but their situations are completely opposite. Hurricanes originate at sea and travel from west to east, while low-pressure winds originate on land and travel from east to west. The one that affected this city the other day was a low-pressure wind. As for the green color of the Huangpu River water recently, it is due to the prolonged drought and has nothing to do with the rise and fall of tides.</p>

The organizers, out of seriousness and piety, notified all butchers in the town to suspend slaughter for three days during the prayer period (the 9th, 10th, and 11th of this month). Therefore, all shops and residents in Wusong Town were vegetarian and fasted. Now that the prayer period has ended, all fresh meat shops have resumed business as of yesterday.</p>
<h3 id="e128">Commercial Press Compiles and Prints Series Integration for Sale Pre-Orders – Compiling the Great Achievement of Series – Broadening the Dissemination of Ancient Books <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>The compilation of series in our country began with Yu Fengsun's "Confucianism Awakening" in the Song Dynasty, followed by Zuo Yuxi's "Hundred Rivers Learning Sea." During the Ming and Qing Dynasties, there were more and more refined compilations. All surviving classics, lost histories, good customs, benevolent governance, admirable deeds, and strange anecdotes were examined and briefly described. However, there were thousands of volumes published from the Song Dynasty to the Qing Dynasty, and among them, the names and realities did not match in five or six out of ten cases. Deletions, revisions, and trivial matters were even more common. If one did not choose carefully, purchasing many volumes would waste money, and reading them indiscriminately would waste energy. Since resuming business, the Commercial Press has successively published the "First Collection of Rare Treasures from the Complete Library of the Four Branches of Literature," the "Supplement to the Four Branches of Literature," and "Forty Kinds of the Wanwei Secret Collection" in terms of promoting national essence and circulating ancient books. Now, with the same purpose, it is further organizing the old series in our country, selecting the best of the good books from the series collected by the library over the years, eliminating repetitions, organizing the format, and naming it "The First Compilation of Series Integration." The selection criteria are based on practicality and rarity, the former to meet needs and the latter to circulate orphan copies. Roughly divided into three categories: ordinary series, specialized series, and local series. Each category is divided into several sections. All books are uniformly punctuated and printed on high-quality Daolin paper. It is divided into 4,000 volumes. The cause and general catalog were published in various newspapers at home and abroad in March of this year. Pre-orders have started on the 1st of this month. The original engraved value of the one hundred selected series is over 10,000 gold. The library's organized typesetting pre-order price is 460 yuan if paid in one lump sum this month, 500 yuan in June, and 540 yuan in July. There are also separate payment methods for the convenience of buyers. Sample copies and pre-order brochures are available for solicitation.

The essence of domestic series, what libraries and collectors spend huge sums to seek but cannot obtain or is not easy to obtain, can now be obtained at one-twentieth of the price of the original book, and everyone can obtain it. Isn't this a happy event? Contemporary sages believe that organizing national studies is a necessary path to revitalize the nation. The library's compilation and printing of this series integration meets the needs of the times, and those who cherish predecessors and respect local sages can also use this to glimpse their writings and theories, which is beneficial to both academic research and cultural training.</p>
<h3 id="e129">Reporters Association Voices Support for Jingjiang Daily – Cables to Censor Su Minting for Investigation <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai News Reporters Association received a letter from Huang Zhian, editor of the Jingjiang Daily, stating that Liu Jian'er, an editor of the newspaper, was illegally arrested by Li Pufang, the acting magistrate of Jingjiang County, and the newspaper was ordered to cease publication. A special request was made for support. The association convened a standing committee meeting yesterday (the 13th) to discuss the matter. It was unanimously agreed that the county magistrate was acting illegally and abusing his power. A decision was made to cable the Censor, the Jiangsu Provincial Party Department, the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Civil Affairs, and the Jiangsu High Court to request an investigation. The text of the cable is as follows: To Ding Censor, Jiangsu Provincial Party Department, Director Yu of the Department of Civil Affairs, and Chief Hu of the Suzhou High Court, forwarded by the Nanjing Supervisory Yuan: We have just received a letter from Huang Zhian, editor of the Jingjiang Daily, stating that Li Jinfang, the acting magistrate of Jingjiang County, because the newspaper published the novel "Injection," which was deemed to have damaged his reputation, illegally arrested Liu Jianfan, an editor of the newspaper, sentenced him to imprisonment, and sent armed police to order the newspaper to cease publication. Such abuse of power and illegality are extreme. In addition to filing a lawsuit in accordance with the law, we ask for your justice and unanimous support. It has been repeatedly ordered by the central government that the duties of news reporters should be strictly enforced by local administrative authorities. Now, Li Jinfang, the magistrate of Jingjiang County, uses his personal grievances to destroy speech and trample on human rights, treating national laws as mere trifles and abusing the law to an extreme degree. The association has decided to unanimously support this matter and requests a thorough investigation to warn against official malfeasance and uphold justice. We are sincerely grateful for your prompt response. Shanghai News Reporters Association, Keqiyuan.</p>

<h3 id="e131">Pudong Fellow Villagers Association Petitions the Municipal Government to Dredge Agricultural Rivers to Facilitate Farmland Irrigation and Transportation – Water Conservancy Agency Under Review by Economic Council <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>The Pudong Fellow Villagers Association believes that the main rivers in Pudong have been neglected for many years, and the accumulated silt is increasing day by day, affecting both farmland irrigation and ship transportation. Therefore, it has specially petitioned the Municipal Government to be in charge and dredge the rivers. Furthermore, the association's Standing Committee member Du Yong and others suggested establishing a Huangpu Water Conservancy Agency. The National Economic Council has ordered the Yangtze River Water Conservancy Commission to formulate measures for review and handling. A reporter from the Dagong Society has investigated and reported the following details.</p>
<p>Petition to the Municipal Government to Dredge Agricultural Rivers: Petition to devise ways to dredge the main rivers in Pudong to benefit farmland and transportation. We earnestly request that the competent authorities review and handle the matter. We believe that water conservancy is related to the national economy and people's livelihood and should be valued by the administration. Therefore, the National Economic Council has listed it as a major task, and the government has long had the "Shanghai Municipal River Regulations" and a river system table. The rivers in the East River section listed in the system table as second-class main rivers are the Dajiangpu and Zhaojiagou in the Gaolu districts, the Bailianjing in the Tangyang districts, the Gaoqiao Port in the Gaochang districts, the Yangjing Port in the Yangjing district, and the Yangsi Port in the Yangsi district. The rivers listed as first-class tributaries are the Yangjiabang in Gaoqiao, the Xiantangbang in Gaoxing district, the Duqianpei and Lujiugou in the Gaolu districts, the Majiabang and Zhuangjiagou in the Luyang districts, and the Huacaozhongfenjing in the Yangtang districts. The above rivers are used for farmland irrigation and ship transportation, and they are no less than the water lifeline of the entire Pudong. Most of the rivers have been accumulating silt for many years and urgently need to be dredged. Last year, the weather was arid and dry, and the farmland suffered considerable losses. It is imperative to make amends before it is too late. The association held its fourth general meeting of members on February 17th of this year and the 35th board meeting on March 14th. After detailed discussion, it was unanimously decided that the administrative authorities should be requested to conduct surveys and construct in stages. According to reports from members, the Municipal Bureau of Public Works and the Chuansha County Government consulted on dredging Zhaojiagou the year before last. The Chuansha territory was completed in the spring of the 23rd year, but the Shanghai territory has not yet started construction, and the smooth flow of the Shanghai territory has caused serious damage due to the tide and siltation. Furthermore, in the autumn and winter of last year, the Municipal Bureau of Public Works guided the organization of the Yangjing District River Dredging Committee to raise funds for dredging various rivers such as Yangjing Port, but it was unable to proceed due to lack of funds, and it will become a pipe dream. Now that your government is planning to relieve rural businesses, it seems that focusing on water conservancy should be the top priority. In addition to the above-mentioned Zhaojiagou Yangjing Port, which have been planned, please instruct the Bureau of Public Works to list them as the most important projects and handle them in accordance with the first item in Article 2 of the River Dredging Regulations. Other main and tributary rivers in Pudong should also be planned at the same time or carried out in stages, and we hope that they will be completed in the near future. All reasons for requesting the dredging of the main rivers in Pudong to benefit farmland and transportation are hereby presented for review and approval, and for forwarding to the Bureau of Public Works for responsible handling. We await instructions with deep public gratitude. Respectfully submitted to Shanghai Municipal Government Mayor Wu.</p>
<p>Water Conservancy Agency Under Review by Economic Council: The Pudong Fellow Villagers Association believes that the Huangpu River waterway is shallow and narrow. It specially established a National Economic Council to organize and reorganize the Huangpu River waterway agency, and transferred the existing funds of the Junpu Bureau to the reorganization agency, so as to be solely responsible for guarding it. The association has received a reply from the Economic Council stating: Upon receiving your request, we believe that the Huangpu River waterway is gradually becoming shallow and narrow, and we intend to organize and reorganize the agency in accordance with the Yangtze River method, and attach four brief descriptions to the council. After reviewing this case, the case was previously sent by the Water Conservancy Office of this Council to the Jiangsu Provincial Government with the same reason. The original documents were copied and attached by this Council, and the Yangtze River Water Conservancy Commission was ordered to review and reply to the case. It should wait for the reply to arrive at the council before reviewing and handling it. This response is for the Pudong Fellow Villagers Association for your information.</p>

<h3 id="e132">Qimei Road: Low-Income Housing to Be Built Soon – Designs Have Been Finalized, Totaling 242 Units <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Government plans to build low-income housing for the welfare of the common people. Yesterday, Liu Hongdian of the Municipal Expansion Center Construction Committee told a reporter from the Shenshi Society that the Municipal Government has decided to first build the low-income housing near Qimei Road. The designs were finalized by the Low-Income Welfare Undertakings Committee last Friday. The low-income housing in that area is divided into two types, A and B. There are 200 units of type A housing, equipped with a living room, bedroom (i.e., mezzanine), kitchen, and toilet, connected by five rooms. There are 42 units of type B housing, equipped with a living room, kitchen, toilet, and other facilities, connected by two rooms. For the sake of air circulation, both types A and B housing face south, and the alleys are on one side. All housing is also equipped with a low-income elementary school, 20 men's bathrooms (shower), 15 women's bathrooms (shower), an auditorium, a clinic, a consumer cooperative, a tea room, a sports field, a public toilet, a laundry room, and other facilities, which are very thoughtful and complete. The construction cost for both types A and B housing and all attached facilities is approximately 120,000 yuan. The rent for each unit of type A housing is approximately 3 yuan, and the rent for each unit of type B housing is approximately 3.5 to 4 yuan. Type B housing has a bedroom, while type A housing only has a mezzanine, which is more convenient, so the rent is more expensive. Each unit of both types A and B housing can accommodate four to six people. Now that the designs have been finalized, bidding will be solicited for construction soon, and construction can begin in the shortest period of time. As for the Tanziwan housing, the designs have not yet been finalized, so the construction period will be slower.</p>
<h3 id="e133">Child Kidnapped on Rue Lemaire, French Concession, Last Night – Li Guanlin's Son, Jinxiang, Kidnapped – Four or Five Bandits Escaped Completely <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>On the extreme west Rue Lemaire in the French Concession, there is a rural area called Houlijiazhai. Most of the residents have the surname Li. Among them is Li Guanlin, a local, 36 years old, whose ancestors have lived here for generations. He has several acres of land, which he cultivates himself. He married Ms. Shen in his early years, who is now 32 years old. They have a son named Jinxiang, who is only four years old. The family is harmonious and happy. Moreover, because the Li couple is diligent and thrifty, they have some savings. Recently, they hired workers to build more than ten bungalows on the ancestral property in the area and rented them out. Unexpectedly, this attracted the attention of bandits. At around 9 PM last night, four or five short-dressed bandits wearing blue cloth shirts and pants, each holding a pistol, broke into Li's house. Li's wife, Ms. Shen, was holding Jinxiang and sitting idly in the living room. When the bandits entered the house, they first snatched Li's son, Jinxiang, from Ms. Shen's arms. Ms. Shen was terrified and screamed. A bandit fired a shot into the sky to warn against resistance. Ms. Shen was unable to resist, and because the area was unusually remote, no one came to help, allowing the bandits to calmly kidnap Li's son. Afterwards, Li reported to the French Concession police. The captain immediately dispatched a large number of Chinese and Western detectives to search for the bandits, but they had already escaped without a trace. The police are now making every effort to investigate.</p>
<h3 id="e134">Citizen Association on Nanjing Road Requests Convening a Chinese Taxpayers' Congress – Firmly Opposed to Telephone Price Increase – Discussing Final Countermeasures <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Telephone Company will implement a per-call calculation for commercial telephones, and there is talk that the Public Works Bureau has approved it, which has aroused repercussions from all users. More than 100 public organizations in the city have successively requested the Chinese Taxpayers' Association to protest to the Public Works Bureau in order to cancel the purpose. The First Branch of the Citizen Association on Nanjing Road replied yesterday to the Public Concession Chinese Taxpayers' Association and the Special District Citizen Federation, requesting that all Chinese taxpayers in the concession be convened to discuss the final countermeasures. The original letter stated: Dear Sirs, Case investigation The Shanghai Telephone Company in the Public Concession has repeatedly increased prices, and the citizens in the concession have repeatedly expressed their opposition. Our association, as a citizen group, has repeatedly expressed its firm opposition based on the opinions of the public members. However, the passage has caused uneasiness among the Sichuan users and has failed to give full play to the effectiveness of using the telephone, which has been reduced invisibly, hindering communication. On the 8th of this month, we heard news that the Public Works Bureau discussed the issue of telephone price increases. Although the company's newly proposed price increase and charging method has not been specifically decided, its content is still based on per-call calculation for commercial telephones, with a limit of 150 calls per month. If this limit is exceeded, a fee of 3 cents will be charged for each call. This method is still not what commercial users want to hear, and the reasons it holds are still focused on the company's profit issues, with unrealistic predictions, and disregarding the opinions of Mr. Yu Zuoting, chairman of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, who represents the merchants of the city. Our association believes that it is still necessary to vigorously oppose the implementation of price increases and this per-call charging method. Even if the per-call pricing can suppress the lowest charge, there must be a huge difference between the company's and the user's records in the calculation, resulting in disputes. Our association has already had factual proof of this. We urge you to quickly discuss effective measures to continue to protest with courage and represent the citizens, and to convene a Chinese taxpayers' congress in the Public Concession and the French Concession to discuss countermeasures if the goal cannot be achieved in the end, so that all Chinese taxpayers have a unified plan to follow. We are deeply grateful for your public service.</p>
<h3 id="e135">Yesterday's Student Domestic Goods Annual Meeting: Eight-District Exhibition Opens – Over 1,000 People Attend, Including Pan Gongzhan <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Student Domestic Goods Year Promotion Federation held the opening ceremony of the Eight-District Domestic Student Supplies Exhibition at the Tongji Middle School Affiliated to Wusong at 10 AM yesterday. Attendees included Pan Gongzhan, Tao Guangchuan (representing Cheng Kuankuan), Yang Weiyu (representing Zhu Changli), Ting Xun, Cheng Kuankuan, Weng Zhilong (representing Wei Shouchun), Su Shude, Lu Zhenbang, Gu Tianyi, Li Chengyun, Wang Cheng'e, Jiang Duchun, Zhuan Zhenbei, Xi Baisui, Wang Shushan, representatives from Wusong elementary and middle schools, Tongji high and middle schools, Luxiang Elementary School, Junpu Bureau Elementary School, the Eight-District Education, the Eight-District Party Department, and citizens, totaling approximately 1,000 people. The venue and auditorium were maintained by the Wusong Middle School Boy Scouts and local Public Security Bureau police officers. The venue displayed exquisite products from various domestic goods factories and had a sales department. Slogans and cartoons were posted all around.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report: After the formalities were performed, Weng Zhilong, representing Jiang Shouchun, reported on behalf of the presidium that the significance of the exhibition is to awaken students' concept of loving and using domestic goods. The influx of imported goods into China is tantamount to sucking the fat of our country and cutting the flesh of our country. Therefore, the more imported goods are imported, the poorer and weaker the country will be. The only way to save this poor and weak country is to use domestic goods, which can achieve great results. I hope that all students can start from now on to use domestic goods absolutely and encourage relatives, family friends, and the entire society to use domestic goods. Then, Cheng Kuanzheng, principal of Wusong Middle School, reported on behalf of the presidium that the significance of the Student Domestic Goods Year is that all students in the country must use domestic goods from this year onwards, and be responsible for persuading relatives and friends to use domestic goods. From stationery to all supplies and food, only domestic goods must be bought, and only domestic products must be used in order to prevent money from flowing out. If money does not flow out, then the strength of the country can be achieved immediately. This is an invisible war, which is more effective than the general visible war with guns and cannons. Therefore, I hope that all students will (1) remove the mentality of taking shortcuts and strictly and consistently use domestic goods, and (2) lead by example and encourage others to use domestic goods. Zhu Changli then reported on the preparations before the meeting adjourned.</p>
<p>Grand Occasion of the Meeting: After the ceremony, attendees visited the exhibition and took photos. At the same time, the manufacturers in the sales department sold exquisite products at special discount prices, allowing visitors to have the opportunity to try exquisite domestic goods. Therefore, the venue was extremely crowded. It is said that in addition to the factories from the last seven districts continuing to participate in the sales, the manufacturers participating in the sales department this time include the Jinglun Textile Factory, the Zhongxin Factory, the Family Bakery, the Meixin Umbrella Factory, the "Ximen Domestic Goods Company," the China Domestic Goods Company, and dozens of other companies.</p>
<h3 id="e136">Head of Opium Den on Rue Amiral Bayle, Cai Bicheng, Appeals; Initial Sentence of Five Years Deemed Fair by Police; Appeal Hearing Concludes, Sentence Set for 22nd <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>In the newly built four-story mansion at numbers 175 and 177 on Rue Amiral Bayle, a loud boom suddenly resounded on the morning of last year's Double Tenth Festival. Flames soared, and disaster struck. Upon hearing the alert, the fire brigade and the Xin Zha police station dispatched firefighters and Chinese and foreign detectives who arrived to extinguish the blaze. Three workers, Gong Baochang, Gong Wenfu, and Miao Zhangcai, were intercepted as they fled the building. Upon entering, it was discovered that the fire was caused by a</p>
<p>Steam Boiler Explosion. The steam boiler was part of equipment used to refine heroin and morphine, and was established by Cai Bicheng, alias Cai Boping, Cai Shizheng, from Hefei, Anhui. Cai resided at number 24 Qinyuan Village, Xin Zha Road. Detectives Cui Chengke and Huang Fusen went to the address to investigate, but Cai had already fled. Subsequently, the First Special District Court interrogated and punished Gong and the other two, and issued an arrest warrant for Cai. It was not until last month that Cui and Huang apprehended Cai at number 179, Route Kroc, in the French Concession and brought him before the First Special Court, which sentenced him to</p>
<p>Five Years Imprisonment, along with a fine of five thousand yuan. However, Cai denied establishing the drug manufacturing operation, and dissatisfied with the conviction and sentence, he hired lawyers Jiang Yiping and Yu Xiangqin to appeal to the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Yu, along with Judges Su and Zhou, opened the court for the appeal hearing. Prosecutor Zhong Qing also attended to perform his duties. Judge Yu questioned Cai Bicheng, who stated that number 24 Qinyuan Village, Xin Zha Road, was</p>
<p>His Younger Brother's Residence. He himself had lived on Rue Amiral Courbet. In June of last year, his brother returned to his hometown, and died there of illness in July. He then moved to his brother's residence. Around September, a friend surnamed Wang came and said he intended to organize a company with the China Carpet Company, with each share costing 1,500 yuan, totaling 20 shares. He asked Cai to invest in shares. After much persuasion, he reluctantly agreed to purchase one share, but never entered the company, so he was unaware of its contents. On the day of the fire, he went to visit his ailing father at the Qichang Inn. In the evening, he read that day's evening newspaper at the inn, which reported that the Xinghua Company was a</p>
<p>Drug Manufacturing Operation, and had caught fire that morning. The mastermind, Cai, had escaped. He was extremely shocked and immediately called his family, who informed him that the police were searching for him. He dared not return home and temporarily went back to his hometown with his father. He was actually harmed by the Wang fellow. His return to Shanghai was to find Wang and investigate the actual situation in order to turn himself in, but he was arrested instead. The location of the operation was next to the main road and not in a secluded area. How could he have such audacity? If it had been established by him, he would certainly not have</p>
<p>Been Neighbors with His Residence. Furthermore, the three people who testified in the initial trial were unable to provide clear evidence. Therefore, he had filed this appeal, requesting a thorough investigation. He had a 75-year-old mother above him and children under the age of ten below him, who relied on him for support, etc. Lawyers Jiang and Yu then defended him, arguing on the basis of facts and law. Regarding the legal argument,</p>
<p>The Criminal Law Stipulates that manufacturing heroin is punishable by up to five years imprisonment. However, in recent years, those who commit such crimes have rarely been sentenced to the full five years. Yet, Cai was given this heavy sentence, which seems to be an unfair application of the law for the same crime. The initial sentencing was inappropriate and should be reconsidered. Police lawyer Gan Jingxian countered that the initial judgment was very fair, and the defendant had confessed without hesitation. He asked that the appeal be rejected. The court then declared the debate closed, and scheduled the sentencing for the afternoon of the 22nd of this month.</p>

<p>The owner of the Dollar Steamship Line, since the death of Robert Dollar, is now his eldest son, Harold Dollar, who has succeeded his father. During this American economic mission to China, Harold Dollar joined the delegation to Shanghai for study, as well as to inspect the operations of the bank's shipping conditions and wood sections. He also inspected businesses in Hong Kong and Luzon in the Far East. He had now returned to Shanghai. On Sunday, he gathered all the employees of the Shanghai office at the residence of Mr. Steen, the Shanghai manager of the bank, and Harold Dollar provided refreshments. Two directors, Wu Hongyuan and Fu Wenyuan, were also present. Harold Dollar gave a speech, expressing his satisfaction with the efforts of all the employees, and was particularly grateful for the assistance of Mr. Wu and Mr. Fu. Last night, Harold departed Shanghai on the bank's President McKinley liner, heading to Kobe, Japan, and then transferring to the President Hoover liner to return to America. This time, the younger Dollar arrived in Shanghai just in time for the Shanghai Spring Champagne Races, and purchased a champagne ticket. Upon the lottery draw, the first prize, 1235, was won by Harold. The prize money of over 70,000 yuan was enough for him to travel the world several times. It was said that Harold, whose name meant "foreign money," came empty-handed and left fully loaded. Arriving in Shanghai and winning the first prize in the champagne lottery was truly living up to his name.</p>

<p>According to the Xin Xin News Agency, the Yangzhou Eight Counties Sojourners Association of Renji Lane, Xin Zha Road, received a letter from fellow townsman Yin Shengtiao stating that his thirteen-year-old daughter, named A Pei, had been raped by a member of the Isok Circus troupe, requesting assistance. After receiving the letter, the association convened a meeting to discuss rescue measures. As a result, they hired lawyer O Sen, who, along with the victim's family, went to the French General Police Station at 11:00 AM the other day to inquire with the French Consul General, but returned without meeting him as he was out. It is now learned that lawyer O Sen visited the French General Police Station again yesterday morning at 10:00 AM. The French Consul General, Gabriel, personally received him and stated that the results of the investigation, as well as evidence and confessions, had been sent by the French police to the French Consul General last Friday for transfer to the Dutch Consulate for review. It is also learned that, in addition to seeking assistance from the fellow townsman association, the family has also formally filed a lawsuit in court.</p>

<p>The area west of the Shanghai South Railway Station on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway, known as Wai Yangqi, is land leased out by the railway. There has been a coffin stored there for many years, yet to be reburied. Yesterday, it was suddenly discovered that the coffin lid had been opened and a new corpse placed inside. The corpse was of a man around thirty years old, wearing a white undershirt and black pants, appearing to be a worker. He had clearly been assassinated before his body was moved there. He had two gunshot wounds in his lower body. The stench was overwhelming. The railway police noticed it and reported it to the police section, who ordered the local bailiff to report it to the local court for inspection. Upon receiving the report, the court dispatched Inspector Kong, along with police officers, to the scene at 4:00 PM yesterday for inspection. It was confirmed that the man had been shot to death and his body moved there. He had two fatal gunshot wounds in his lower abdomen. The other original corpse had decomposed, with only bones remaining. After the inspector completed the examination, he completed the corpse report and ordered the search for the murderer to be investigated and brought to justice. He also ordered the local bailiff to prepare another coffin for burial.</p>

<p>At number 105 in the Siwen Lane of the Datong Road, Xin Zha Road in the Public Concession, the Wang Deji Umbrella Factory had previously been leased and opened by Wang Deji. It is now leased by Zhuang Agui, a local, and renamed the Yongfeng Iron-Handled Umbrella Manufacturing Factory. However, the iron-handled umbrellas require electric welding, so a large straw shed was rented in the western section of the lane to serve as the electric welding workshop. The electric welding work in the factory has been contracted out to He Donghai, who was introduced by the former factory owner, Wang Deji. He is responsible for the electric welding work in the workshop. Yesterday (the 13th) at around 10:00 AM, He went elsewhere for some reason and ordered the apprentice, Xu Fuqing (age 19, from Jingjiang), to do the work. As Xu was holding the welding torch to weld copper, somehow the torch suddenly exploded. With a loud bang, the torch shot upwards, breaking through the straw shed roof and flying dozens of feet high. Xu, seeing the disaster, quickly fled out of the workshop to save his life. Unfortunately, the torch fell from the sky and hit Xu on the top of his head. His skull was shattered instantly, and his brains spilled out. He immediately fell to the ground and died. When the patrolling police heard the sound and rushed to the scene, Xu was already dead in a pool of blood, with a pile of brain matter and a piece of skull next to him. The scene was tragic. They immediately reported to the police chief and ordered detectives to the scene. In addition to sending the body to the forensic examination office on Fielun Road in Hongkou for examination, they also investigated He Donghai, who contracted the electric welding work for the factory, but he had already disappeared. Later, the factory owner, Zhuang Agui, was summoned to the police station to inquire about the circumstances of the accident in order to handle the matter accordingly.</p>

<p>Sheng Caiying, a woman from Sizhou, 21 years old, lived at number 3 in the Shoufu Lane of Taiping Bridge in the French Concession. Yesterday morning at around 10:00 AM, Caiying, holding her two-year-old adopted daughter, Ai Lin, and accompanied by her friend Xu Xiuzhen (25 years old, from Zhenjiang, residing at number 7 in the Lanxin Lane of Route de Geler), and Xu's child Chunlin, went to Xiaodongmen to buy foreign cloth. At around 11:00 AM, they walked to the Fangbang Road area in the city. Sheng Caiying planned to eat snacks in the City God Temple. However, Xu Xiuzhen was eager to return home, so she declined. After walking a few steps, they suddenly encountered a robber, one wearing a blue short-sleeved shirt and pants, and the other wearing a blue long gown, who blocked their way. They forcibly robbed Sheng Caiying of a gold bracelet and a gold watch worn on her wrist, and attempted to escape with the loot. Unexpectedly, Caiying grabbed one of the robbers, shouting for help loudly, angering the robbers. One of the robbers wearing the long gown pulled out a pistol and fired a shot, hitting Caiying in the head, penetrating through the back of her head. Instantly, her brains splattered and she fell to the ground in extreme pain. The two robbers fled north. The Laobeimen Police Station in charge of the area was notified and ordered Inspector Zhang Lantian and other police officers to rush to the scene to surround and arrest the robbers. However, the robbers had already gone far away and could not be apprehended. The wounded Sheng Caiying was sent to the Nanyang Hospital for treatment. However, because the injury was fatal, she died shortly after arriving at the hospital.</p>
<p>Strange Boat at Customs Wharf; Japanese Consulate Acknowledges It as Japanese Fishing Boat; Regularly Fishes Near Shanghai</p>
<p>According to the Xin Sheng News Agency, a strange boat was suddenly discovered at the Customs Wharf on the Huangpu River at around 4:00 PM on the 11th of this month. After investigation by the customs, it was found to be a Japanese fishing boat and was immediately handed over to the Japanese Consulate for handling. According to the Japanese Consulate General, the boat is named the No. 92 Banshu Maru, a small fishing boat with a displacement of one hundred tons, which regularly fishes near Shanghai. On the 7th of this month, it and its companion, the No. 93 fishing boat, were caught in dense fog about seven or eight miles from Shanghai, causing them to go off course and drift into the Huangpu River, leading to their detention by customs. It should be noted whether the boat frequently fishes near Shanghai, whether it enters our territorial waters, and whether it infringes on our fishing rights.</p>

<p>To the Editor,</p>
<p>I have just read your newspaper's report about the collapse of the foreign-style building in front of number 749 Avenue Joffre and the Fatai Photo Studio, etc., at 3:00 PM on May 10, injuring pedestrians. The police immediately took the landlord, Gao Zhu, the owner of the Fatai Photo Studio, Zhou Ada, and Zhang Puyu, the accountant of Yongtai, as well as the apprentice Lu Fusheng, to the police station. The area in front of the building was not a veranda, but a railing (which was built by the landlord himself). It was also reported that Zhang Zhaoquan was the second landlord and subleased it to Zhou Ada, and that the owner of the Yongtai store was evasive and hiding the truth. After reading this carefully, I was shocked. The owner of the Fatai Photo Studio, Zhou Ada, has been renting from the landlord, Gao Zhu, for more than ten years, while Yongtai has only been there for three years. I am not involved in the lease. Zhang Zhaoquan was not questioned by the police, so there is no question of being evasive and hiding the truth. In summary, the various points mentioned do not correspond to the facts. Please correct the record immediately to avoid spreading misinformation, as it is a matter of great importance to my reputation and responsibility. Please investigate and correct this.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Zhang Zhaoquan of Yongtai</p>

<h3 id="e153">Three Crew Members of the Jiahe Steamer Released After Ransom Paid; After Six Months in Bandits' Den, They Are En Route to Shanghai <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Jiahe steamer was hijacked last year, and three crew members were kidnapped, demanding a huge ransom. It has been half a year since then. The families of the hostages have repeatedly negotiated the ransom, going through four rounds. It was not until this time that the families personally went to Hong Kong to negotiate with the bandits, and then the three were released. They are now on their way and are expected to arrive in Shanghai on Thursday. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>The Jiahe Hijacking Incident: The Jiahe steamer was hijacked by pirates on November 4 last year in Shantou. The twelve pirates intended to steal 300,000 yuan in new banknotes, but the new banknotes had not been stamped and could not be used. They were robbed of more than 2,000 yuan in cash and shot and killed航警 Yang Zetian. Before leaving, they kidnapped the business director, Shen Qinxiang, the tallyman, Ge Liangchen, and the accountant, Li Xiaobin. The three were taken to the Dapeng Bay island and hidden, in order to demand a huge ransom.</p>
<p>Four Rounds of Ransom Negotiations: For the issue of redeeming the three hostages, negotiations have been held four times with the pirates' representatives in Hong Kong. The first three times, the ransom demanded by the bandits was too high, sometimes 20,000 yuan, sometimes 60,000 yuan. The representatives sent by the families of the hostages had no results from the negotiations and had already spent more than 1,000 yuan. They had to withdraw to Shanghai, expressing their willingness to abandon the negotiations and leave the hostages to the bandits' disposal. Until the fourth time last month, the bandits voluntarily reduced the ransom and asked the three families to go to negotiate in person.</p>
<p>Families Go to Negotiate in Person: On March 22, the families of the three hostages took the Anxing steamer from Shanghai to Hong Kong for the final negotiations with the pirates' representatives. The ransom for the three hostages was at most 2,000 yuan each. After the families arrived in Hong Kong, they spent a long time negotiating for a month before finally reaching an agreement with the bandits and redeeming Shen, Li, and Ge. Each family paid the bandits a certain amount (the amount is unknown and will be known when they arrive in Shanghai). The bandit leader then released the three hostages and handed them over to their families to bring them back to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Departed Hong Kong for Shanghai: Shen Qinxiang, Li Xiaobin, and Ge Liangchen, the three hostages, were released from the bandits' den after the families paid the ransom last month. The bandits led them to Hong Kong and handed them over to their families to bring them back to Shanghai. Shen, Li, and Ge have now telegraphed from Hong Kong to Shanghai, saying that they have escaped from the bandits' den and are taking the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Haiheng steamer from Hong Kong, accompanied by their families, back to Shanghai. They are expected to arrive on Thursday (the 16th).</p>
<h3 id="e154">Shangguan Min defrauded funds and absconded, eloping with a dancing girl to Hong Kong and Guangdong, resorting to this tactic due to failed speculation, and was arrested upon returning to Shanghai in front of the police station <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>Shangguan Min Geng, also known as Chen Shaoying, a native of Hai Ning, is currently twenty-five years old. He previously worked as an accountant at Shen Da Transportation Company at 504 Edward Road. Because he was fond of pleasure-seeking, indulged in song and dance halls, and also engaged in speculation that failed, his income could not cover his expenses, resulting in a huge deficit that he could not make up for. Therefore, on October 15th of last year, he used a worthless check from the Central Trust Company to exchange checks with Jiang Lian'en, the acting accountant of the company, and defrauded them of 7,300 yuan in foreign currency.</p>
<p>He abandoned his job and absconded without a trace. Gao Zijia, the general manager of Shen Da Company, reported the situation to the police station, requesting the First Special Court to issue an arrest warrant. Meanwhile, Shen Da Company published a reward notice offering 1,000 yuan in foreign currency for his arrest. It was not until around 8 PM on the 11th of this month that Shangguan Min Geng was arrested and detained in front of the Chengdu Road Police Station by Chinese detective Shi Shanqing and Western detective Gai Zilai. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special Court, and Qian Xunjiu, the legal representative of the Shanghai Municipal Council's Legal Department,</p>
<p>filed a lawsuit in accordance with Articles 363 and 366 of the Criminal Law for fraud and breach of trust, detailing the course of events. He stated that on October 24th of last year, Gao Zijia, the general manager of Shen Da Company, reported to the police station that Shangguan Min Geng, the company's accountant in charge of books, had used fraudulent means to defraud them of 7,300 yuan in foreign currency, which he squandered outside, and became intimate with Gao Xiaomeimei, a dancing girl from the Yangtze Dance Hall.</p>
<p>They eloped with the money. As for his fraudulent method, he exchanged a Ningtou check from the Central Trust Company with Jiang Lian'en, the accountant in charge of money, for a check from the company to be cashed. It was discovered that the company's money accounting room was originally expanded and appointed by Shangguan Tingmu, a cousin of the defendant. At that time, Shangguan Tingmu happened to be in Hangzhou, so Jiang Yun'en was acting as his agent. The defendant took advantage of this opportunity to deceive and exchange the checks, and so on. Upon receiving the report, the police station</p>
<p>had no other clues to find. They had to start with the dancing girl Gao Xiaomeimei and learned that Miss Gao lived on Avenue Joffre in the French Concession. Chinese and Western detectives went to investigate. According to Miss Gao's mother, her daughter had not returned for several days and her whereabouts were unknown. It was not until October 28th that Gao Xiaomeimei suddenly surrendered to the police station and explained the situation. She said that she met the defendant, who, on October 18th, used the alias Chen Shaoying and asked Miss Gao to travel to Hong Kong with him. They then took the Suzhou ship and left Shanghai for Hong Kong. They stayed at the New China Hotel</p>
<p>for four nights and then went to Quanzhou, staying at the Zhongshan Hotel for four days as well. Later, because Miss Gao had to return to Shanghai for business, Chen returned to Shanghai with her and stayed at Miss Gao's house for several days. Because Chen insisted on going to Suzhou, Miss Gao sent him to the station and bid him farewell. Therefore, according to her speculation, Chen must be in Suzhou, and so on. The police station immediately requested the court to issue an arrest warrant. However, after investigation, it was found that the defendant had sent a letter to Gao Zijia from Hong Kong, stating that he had failed in speculation with his friend Zhang Keming in trading national bonds and had</p>
<p>no way to make up for it. He had to borrow a large sum of money from the company. Later, he intended to commit suicide, but was stopped by his friend Zhang, who provided him with 700 yuan in foreign currency, so he planned to go to England to seek employment, and so on. In fact, what he said in the letter was all fictitious. He was actually eloping with the dancing girl he loved to Hong Kong. Because the police station only stated in his letter that he was in Hong Kong, without a specific location, there was no way to investigate. It was not until the day before yesterday that the defendant was arrested in front of the police station. According to the defendant's confession in the police station, he</p>
<p>originally intended to turn himself in, but he did not have the courage, so he lingered in front of the police station and wrote a confession, detailing the course of events of using the money. Judging from his sad words, there was a sense of regret. The confession was submitted to the case and a request was made to postpone the hearing. When questioned, the defendant Shangguan Min Geng confessed that he had failed in speculation and initially only owed his friend Zhang Keming more than 1,000 yuan in foreign currency. Later, he was encouraged by Zhang, who said that the</p>
<p>market was good at the time and that a lot could be made. Therefore, I exchanged a check from the Central Trust Company due on the 9th of a certain month with Jiang for a check from Shen Da due on the 5th. After cashing it, I first paid off the previous debt of more than 1,000 yuan and then gave Zhang another 3,500 yuan, instructing him to buy and sell when he saw an opportunity. Unexpectedly, after Zhang got the money, he avoided meeting me. Although I went to the Yangtze Dance Hall many times to look for him, I could not find him. Later, according to a friend, Zhang had already gone to Hong Kong, so I eloped with Gao Xiaomeimei to follow him. In</p>
<p>Hong Kong and Guangdong, I searched all the dance halls but could not find him. I also saw the advertisement from my cousin, so I returned to Shanghai. However, at that time, I still had 2,000 yuan in cash with me and wanted to find a way to deal with it. Unexpectedly, after arriving in Shanghai, I saw the wanted advertisement again. I felt that this small amount of 2,000 yuan was of no help, so I did not dare to go there. The day before yesterday, I was actually at the gate of the police station and was not arrested, and so on. Judge Yang verified the confession and ordered the defendant to be detained and await a postponed hearing on Friday.</p>

<p>The tooth tax item in Jiangsu's education funding accounts for about one-sixth of the province's total education expenditure. The tax collection methods are divided into commercial bidding and recognized handling. This year, the Jiangsu Education Funding Management Office revised these tooth tax regulations, and they are now being implemented in accordance with the new regulations. The following are excerpts from the two regulations:</p>
<p>Jiangsu Province's Regulations on Commercial Bidding for Tooth Tax in Various Counties (1) The tooth tax of each county shall be handled through commercial bidding in accordance with the resolution of the Education Funding Committee and the collection method of slaughter tax. (2) The bidding date for each county shall be set by this office. Bids shall be submitted in a sealed box, and personnel shall be sent by the Education Funding Committee to monitor the process. (3) This office shall determine a base amount for the tooth tax of each county. When merchants submit bids, they shall prepare a cash deposit equivalent to one-twentieth of the base amount as a guarantee and submit it to this office (Education Funding Management Office) in advance for inspection and exchange for a bidding ticket. The determined total amount shall be filled in according to the format and put into the box. This office shall open the bids publicly to determine the highest bidder. If two or more bidders offer the same amount, the old merchant shall be given priority. If there is no old merchant, the bids with the same amount may be re-submitted publicly. (4) The deposit paid by the winning bidder shall be deducted from the deposit to be paid. The deposits of unsuccessful bidders shall be returned on the spot. (5) Once a merchant wins the bid, they shall obtain joint guarantees from two or more reputable stores, and after verifying the recognized amount, they shall pay two-tenths of the cash deposit in advance within three days and submit it to this office for verification. No public bonds, stocks, or other items shall be used to offset the payment to avoid trickery. If the deposit cannot be paid in full within the time limit, or if the bid is won but not processed, the bidding right shall be revoked immediately, and the deposit paid shall be confiscated in full. The next highest bidder shall take over the bid. (6) The recognition period is limited to one year. If there is no tax arrears within the time limit, the deposit shall be deducted in the last month of the term. (7) If there are any matters not covered in these regulations, they may be revised at any time.</p>
<p>Jiangsu Province's Regulations on Recognized Handling of Tooth Tax in Various Counties (1) All grades, industries, and tax rates for handling this tooth tax shall be handled in accordance with the tooth industry regulations of this office. If there are any reductions in grades or combined collections due to local customs or commercial depression, the old practices shall be maintained to show consideration. If a recognized merchant is accused of harsh collection or fraud, they shall be punished immediately after investigation and verification. (2) The recognized amount of tooth tax is limited to a short term. The county government shall continue to handle the long-term registration of business taxes and cocoon ticket taxes. (3) If there are educational construction and other surcharges for the tooth tax of each county, the recognized merchant shall collect them in accordance with the existing regulations and report and remit them to the relevant authorities separately, which are not included in the recognized amount of this office. (4) The merchant shall determine the recognized amount and prepare a table of peak and off-peak months, which shall be submitted to this office for verification and approval for monthly remittance. (5) After the merchant determines the recognized amount, they shall report and remit it according to the amount. They shall not ask for reductions or resign midway to prevent trickery. (6) The merchant shall apply to this office in advance for the registration certificates and notices required for the collection of tooth tax, which shall be transferred to the Finance Department for printing and distribution for filling and use. No private receipts shall be issued to prevent fraud. (7) If a tooth household resists tax, it shall be reported to the county government or the Public Security Bureau for investigation and handling. No private penalties shall be imposed to avoid harassment. (8) The merchant who handles this tooth tax shall collect taxes from each tooth in accordance with the regulations. They shall not subcontract to avoid abuses. (9) The recognized amount is of a contracted nature. Regardless of whether the tax revenue is surplus or deficit, the merchant shall be responsible for remitting the full amount. No shortage is allowed. (10) Every month, at the end of the month, the merchant shall prepare a report in accordance with the six forms issued by this office, together with the payment receipts and old certificates, and submit them for verification. No delays are allowed. If the report is not submitted, it will be impossible to verify how many certificates have been used and how many remain. The issuance of certificates will not be approved to ensure caution. (11) All monthly reports must be filled in truthfully. There must be no concealment or falsification of tooth households. If the personnel sent by this office find that the tooth households do not match the forms, they shall be investigated and punished. (12) Of the one-tenth handling fee under the registration tax item, two cents shall be remitted directly to the county government, two cents shall be remitted to the Finance Department, one cent shall be reported and remitted to this office, and the remaining five cents shall be retained by the merchant for office expenses. (13) The aforementioned handling fee shall be reported and remitted separately according to the actual amount collected, not based on the recognized amount. (14) The aforementioned handling fee is collected separately under the registration tax item and is different from the slaughter tax public fee. It shall not be calculated within the recognized amount. (15) The Finance Department's two cents handling fee is currently collected on behalf of this office. It must be paid to the treasury every month, and the treasury receipt shall be sent directly to this office. Do not issue the wrong treasury receipt to avoid trouble. If the county is remote and far from the treasury, cash may be remitted by the post office for transfer to the Finance Department. (16) The educational treasury designates the China Communications Bank and the Jiangsu Bank for reporting and remitting tax payments. Be sure to hand them over to the three banks directly. Do not make mistakes. (17) The payments for month A must be cleared in the middle of month B. If delayed, the committee will propose it. If it is not resolved after two months, the recognition case will be revoked, and the deposit will be used to offset the payment. If it is not enough, the county will be ordered to recover the payment. (18) If the merchant fulfills the one-year term and reports and remits the amount in full every month, and the monthly report is excellent, the renewal of the term may be approved depending on the circumstances to encourage them. (19) When the merchant hands over at the end of the term, all tooth industries that have not expired shall not reduce the tax collection, and the certificates shall be filled in first. If there is any fraud, the successor shall investigate and report it, and the merchant shall be punished by ten times the amount obtained. (20) When the merchant hands over at the end of the term, all registration certificates and notices used and remaining shall be transferred to the successor in full for continued filling and use. If there is any shortage, a fine of 50 yuan per sheet shall be imposed in accordance with the previous tax regulations of the Finance Department. (21) After the merchant hands over the business at the end of the term, all tooth household files, documents, and registration certificates shall be transferred to the successor for counting, and the new and old merchants shall jointly report to this office for record within five days.

Through the efforts of Tai Shuangqiu, Tang Maohuai, and others, it has had an amazing development in the past two years and has long been known to all sectors of society in China. This movement has now attracted the attention of foreign educators. Professor Melvin of the Teachers College of New York University recently sent a letter to the February 2nd Movement Promotion Association at 2631 Zhongshan Road, Shanghai, stating that "the February 2nd Movement is the most meaningful educational movement in China today. I deeply believe that it will have rapid development to achieve the goal of reviving the national economy and will be assisted by the government as a giant in China's popular education. I wrote an article in the China Review Weekly five years ago discussing that China needs an education that is suitable for the economic environment and the interests of the people. At that time, no one paid attention to it. Now this February 2nd Movement is of great significance to the country and the international community. Please send a copy of the photos of the movement, especially the photos of the popular education vehicle and its implementation activities, so that I can write articles and promote it in American newspapers."</p>

<p>The second day of the Municipal District Elementary School Joint Sports Meet was held yesterday in Beixinjing, in the seventh district. Twenty-three schools participated, with 354 male and female athletes. There were twelve sections of group exercises. The opening ceremony was held at 9:00 AM. After a report by Chairman Wang Tongde, the sports began. The men's Group A 200-meter result tied the meet record. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Participating Schools</p>

Except for Shicun Elementary School, which had participated in the Municipal Elementary School Joint Sports Meet, the rest participated for the first time.</p>
<p>Temporary Track</p>
<p>Because the Eighth Physical Education Field in the district is small, the track and field events were held on Lin Road. The road was smooth but not suitable as a track. It was not a circular track, so the 400-meter race was also held in a straight line. The distance between the finish line and the starting point was very far. The sound of the starting gun was barely audible at the finish line, so the timer stood at the midpoint and sprinted to the finish line after the starting gun fired, running two hundred meters, which was also an interesting event. Yesterday, students from the East Asia, Southeast, and China Physical Education Schools were dispatched to assist as referees.</p>
<p>School Overall Scores</p>
<p>Men's Group (1) Wanglou 99 points, (2) Shicun 47 points, (3) Hongxi 13 points, (4) Siqiao 10 points, (5) Huacao 8 points, (6) Chen Du 7 points, (7) Zhuzhai 6 points, (8) Futian 5 points, (9) Jiangzhen 3 points.

<p>The oblique bridge private Huadong Girls' Middle School basketball team went to Songjiang last autumn to compete with the Provincial Songjiang Girls' Middle School and other schools. As a result, they won every battle. This time, the school's track and field team and basketball team were again invited by Songjiang Girls' Middle School and departed for Songjiang last Saturday. That afternoon, a friendly basketball match was played at the Songjiang school's court. Several of Huadong's strong players were unable to travel due to illness, greatly affecting their strength, and they were unfamiliar with the venue, leading to defeat. On Sunday morning, a track and field competition was held. Songjiang Girls' Middle School has produced many track and field talents and has always been a leader in Jiangsu Province, winning many Provincial Sports Meet championships. Huadong is also well-known in Shanghai for track and field, and has won the Municipal Middle School Sports Meet championship many times. The competition between the two schools was akin to a struggle between heroes, competing for dominance. In the end, Huadong won seven of the eight events, returning in triumph.</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>

<p>— (Yan BOGuang)</p>
<p>Last year's autumn harvest was affected by drought, and most of the farmland yielded nothing. This spring, hungry people are everywhere, crying for food. Moreover, families with more children suffer even more from hunger, and they have no choice but to sell their children to avoid starvation. According to investigations, girls are easier to sell than boys, and those with beautiful faces are especially popular with buyers. These girls are all bought by big cities, taught to sing and dance, and in a few years, they may reveal their talents and become stars. This shows that women are indeed more valuable than men.</p>
<p>The weather is gradually getting warmer, and people's clothes are gradually becoming lighter, especially for women, who have already changed into the latest fashions. On the prosperous Nanjing Road in Shanghai, you can see many sensual women—bare legs, bare arms—and most sexually aroused men can't help but exclaim—wonderful—right? But in the countryside, there are also very healthy young women, barefoot, bare thighs, rolling up their sleeves, helping men transplant rice in the fields. Who pays attention to them?</p>
<h3 id="e186">Whispers of Willow Catkins <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>— Qiu Zi</p>
<p>Willow catkins are terribly annoying! The willow flowers fly, ruining everything, a good picture of miscellaneous flowers and trees, and noisy Orioles flying about the beautiful scenery of Jiangnan, all being spoiled by it.</p>
<p>Originally, willow catkins are inherently frivolous, inherently weak, drifting with the wind, completely involuntary. Sometimes, when falling on people's books, it turns into bookworms, eating away at the books. If it falls into a green grass pond, it becomes duckweed, drifting with the waves. During this season of willow catkins, wool and leather must not be exposed to the sun. Therefore, the ancients described frivolous women as "water-like willow catkins," which is simply the most appropriate metaphor.</p>
<p>As for "willow catkin radish," it refers to the small, red, and round radish that is only available when there are willow catkins, and naturally disappears afterward. Willow catkin radish, radish willow catkins, they come together and go together. Sister flowers? Difficult brothers?</p>
<p>The ancients had leisurely moods, "idly watching children catching willow catkins," living the life of a leisure class. Others saw "dots of willow catkins falling into the inkstone," and felt that the spring scenery would not last long, burying themselves in reading the Zhou Yi. Now, crazy willow catkins are dancing in the wind again. This clearly shows to us that "ninety days of spring are about to pass." Friends! Are you excited from this moment on? Does it matter at all?</p>
<h3 id="e187">Hired Carriages <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>— Yan</p>
<p>In Shanghai, taking a hired carriage is not considered grand, because there are friends who own automobiles to overshadow it. However, in inland cities, where streets are narrow and automobiles are useless, those who ride in hired carriages are unique and supreme, exuding an awe-inspiring presence. Although the hired carriages are the same as those in Shanghai, the sounds they emit to clear the way are even more impressive than Shanghai automobiles. Their loudspeaker has two parts: one makes a "coo-coo" sound, and the other makes a "ding-ding-dang-dang" sound. The "coo-coo" sound is as majestic as a lion's roar, and the "ding-ding-dang-dang" sound is as clear and melodious as the clash of gold and stone. Sometimes "coo-coo," sometimes "ding-dang," sometimes "coo-coo ding-dang," they alternate in concert, creating a truly imposing and dignified atmosphere that can make everyone give way. One can leisurely recline in the carriage, right leg crossed over the left, looking around with an air of superiority. How arrogant and enviable!</p>
<p>Hired carriages in Changshu are even more extravagant than those elsewhere. In addition to the advantages of hired carriages in other places, they have a special nighttime splendor. Their carriages are equipped with bright searchlights, with at least two lights on the sides and up to four lights including the rear. Compared to the hired carriages of Shanghai courtesans who have connections, their exquisiteness and brightness are unmatched. A carriage in the street, with a young master sitting inside, the snow-like light and jade-like face reflecting each other, may not win a carriage full of fruit thrown as admiration, but it attracts the attention of thousands, especially winning the favor of beauties, which is enough to be proud of. Since the carriage is so exquisite and dazzling, the coachman must also be neat and tidy to match the carriage. Therefore, the coachmen are often well-dressed, in light summer clothes and warm winter furs. In the cold season, when the coachmen run, they must lift the two lower corners of their long fur coats and tuck them under their belts, ostensibly to make running easier, but in reality, it is to deliberately expose their snow-white fur, showing off their wealth. The coachman's attire is enough to show off his wealth, and the person in the carriage feels even wealthier for having such a coachman.</p>
<p>Do readers doubt my words? Then you should know that Wuxi, Changshu, and other places have many beautiful mountains and rivers. Taking advantage of the bright spring scenery, you might as well go there for sightseeing and, by the way, appreciate their hired carriages.</p>

<h3 id="e189">A Quick Sketch of the Buddha Bathing Festival <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>— Dun</p>
<p>Buddha Bathing Festival: people, men and women, old and young, devout believers with yellow cloth bags, vendors shouting east and west, incense smoke, candlelight, paper ingot scraps... These intertwine to form the annual grand gathering. Although this kind of hustle and bustle happens every year, people still flock in large groups to the Jing'an Temple.</p>
<p>Believers take out shiny silver coins from their bags, exchange them for incense sticks, red candles, and paper ingots at the temple gate, and walk into the temple. In the blink of an eye, the paper ingots turn to ashes, and the incense sticks and red candles are moved away by the temple monks. A faint smile floats on the believers' faces, and they are squeezed into the crowd again. As they step out of the side door of the temple, a Christian gives them a leaflet that says "Do not worship idols." They glance sideways, quickly throw the reactionary slogan to the ground, and seem to say in their mouths: "Bad luck—touching India!"</p>
<p>There is a square well in front of the temple. Some believers buy turtles in the temple and release them into the well, but the well water is very shallow. Vendors often wait for the believers to walk away and then catch the turtles and sell them to the second person. This cyclical and humorous release technique can only be found in the city.</p>
<p>The area around the temple is crowded with stalls, tables, chairs, and rattanware. The open space on the left is a group of various gadgets: peep shows, candy stalls, turntables... All kinds of money-making businesses. With the market downturn, there are more viewers than buyers, and the vendors frown even more under the heavy rain.</p>

<p>He smiled at the two of them and said: I will probably not be here for long. When I return to Jiangnan in the future, the first thing I will do is to report the hardship here to the people of Jiangnan. I dare not say how much I can help the people of the Northwest, but at least I can prevent more corrupt officials from running here, so I am willing to get more reports. Cheng Zhiqian smiled and said: Your words are not what the owner of Little Western Paradise wants to hear. Of the people who come to the Northwest to seek official positions, 50% or 60% live in Great Western Paradise. If you stop them from coming, the business here will be greatly reduced. As he spoke, he walked out of the room. Zhou Yourong was still reluctant to part and followed him all the way to the backyard before returning. Because Cheng Zhiqian was only talking to Zhou Yourong, he walked very slowly and fell a few steps behind. Wang Beihai was too young and didn't know what to consider, so he suddenly rushed into Cheng Zhiqian's room. He rushed straight inside, but he didn't pay attention to what was in front of him, so he didn't see anyone. He only felt a bump in his chest, and he almost fell backward. He quickly grabbed the door frame to steady himself. It was that Miss Zhu Yueying. She was walking out with her head lowered. This head, without any deviation, bumped into Beihai's chest. He took two steps back, looked at Beihai, and then bowed slightly. Her face turned red, and there was something she wanted to say, but seeing that there was still someone behind Beihai, she endured the words that were on the tip of her tongue. Cheng Zhiqian saw clearly and quickly stepped forward and walked into the room. After looking at Yueying, he smiled and said: What? Aren't you gone yet? Yueying held the corner of the table, stood with her head lowered, and replied: I have made Mr. Cheng's house so dirty, how dare I just walk away? (203)</p>

<p>— Originally written by Princess Der Ling of the Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>After this loud shout, there was a great commotion. The dogs on one side of the doghouse quickly ran out. "Woof... woof... woof..." they barked in a chaotic manner, wagging their short tails like crazy, clearly indicating that they were welcoming the Empress Dowager. Seeing this, the Empress Dowager couldn't help but beam with joy, even more pleased than when she received the obeisance of her ministers. Among this group of dogs, the one the Empress Dowager loved the most, named Hailong—which was the one that later followed us to Fengtian—was also among them; this time, I recognized its special talent for the first time. When it saw us, it stood up straight, shrinking its front legs, making a gesture like a bow. Its meaning seemed to be:</p>
<p>"Look! Who else here can be so clever? If I didn't have such a special skill that made other dogs look inferior, how would the Empress Dowager especially favor me?"</p>
<p>However, it couldn't maintain that upright posture for very long, only for about four or five minutes, before it fell back down; I think it was probably because standing up straight was really exhausting, so the animal couldn't last.</p>
<p>We gradually got closer to the doghouses, and the eunuch on duty that day began to gather the dogs that had already come out of the house. Seeing that some were lagging behind and had not yet noticed, he shouted even louder; in this way, they all ran out together. (313)</p>

<p>— (Drunk Madman)</p>
<p>I have two friends, A and B: one is impatient, and the other is slow. Now I will list their amusing stories below to bring a smile.</p>
<p>A likes to drink very much: One day, he passed by a liquor store, and he was a regular customer. He asked the waiter to heat up a pot of wine and took it home himself. When he got home, his wife saw that her husband had brought back a pot of wine. She prepared cups and chopsticks to pour wine for him. But when she picked up the wine pot, it was empty. Surprised, she asked, "Huh! Why is this pot empty and has no wine?" A said, "Because the aroma of the wine rushed to my nose, I had a sudden craving for wine, and I couldn't wait to get home. So, I drank it while walking, and when I got home, the wine was finished."</p>
<p>B is very slow: He subscribes to several major and minor newspapers and wants to read them at night. He reads each one carefully, not willing to miss anything. In this way, he has to read each newspaper carefully according to the day it was published. One night, he picked up a supplement of the China Report to read. A friend happened to come and asked, "What's new in today's newspaper?" B slowly said, "There may be something new. But I read the newspaper according to the schedule. The newspaper I am reading now is still from before this week. Today's newspaper has not been reached yet."</p>
<p>Personal Anecdotes</p>
<h3 id="e193">Record of Gao Zhifang (Part 1) <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>— Pillow Green</p>
<p>"Former master Mr. Zhang's esteemed inspection, your humble servant Gao Zhifang pays his respects. Currently serving at the Xinzha branch of the police force."</p>
<p>One morning last month, a young servant suddenly came into the room and woke me up, handing me this note written in ink, saying that a person who looked like a policeman wanted to see me and had written this note; he said that he hadn't seen his old employer for many years and had come to greet me today and report on his experiences; he could even call out the names of several of my children. I saw that the handwriting was not very good and was also very unfamiliar. After inquiring about this person's appearance, build, and accent, I guessed among the hundreds of people who had eaten at my house in the past, but I couldn't figure out who it was. My eldest daughter went out to peek and rushed back in excitedly to tell me: "It's rickshaw puller A-Gen! Really, he's wearing a police uniform, very new, shaking!" So I told the young servant to ask him to come back in the morning another day, so we could talk more.</p>
<p>This Gao Zhifang is from Jiangbei. He served at my place six or seven years ago; at that time, some people knew that his home was located in the Xuejia Hong area of the South City, in a dilapidated boat with a high deck along the Huangpu River bank. That place was originally a settlement for Jiangbei compatriots, all using the same type of dry boat as their home. He worked as a rickshaw puller, first pulling a rickshaw for a distant relative of mine—a very successful businessman. However, he thought this employer was too vulgar and didn't get along with him, not caring about earning a few extra dollars from him. He could read and write, and whenever he had free time, he would pick up books and newspapers to read, sometimes even reading aloud, which people called him a bookworm. This was also disliked by his employer, who resented that he seemed to be deliberately trying to compete with the employer in qualifications. He also wholeheartedly entrusted a senior relative of mine to bring him to my house; his idea was that because Mr. Zhang was a scholar, he wanted to serve a refined master. Soon, he got his wish and came to my place to work, and he could freely read the available police reports when he had time. In this way, after about a year, he returned to his hometown for some reason and couldn't come out for a while, so he stopped doing business at my place. After that, we didn't hear any news from him until recently.</p>
<p>Sure enough, after a few days, this former rickshaw puller A-Gen, now a police officer Gao Zhifang, came as scheduled. He immediately stood at attention and saluted when he saw me, which made me feel somewhat uneasy; as for him, he still maintained the title of former servant, only standing while talking. I heard the outline of his past.</p>
<p>At that time, when he returned to Shanghai from his hometown, he changed to pulling a yellow rickshaw to make a living, and the situation was even worse than pulling a rickshaw; fortunately, he was an insider, ran fast, and was young—over eleven or twelve years old—so he was still able to barely make a living.</p>

<p>The gold market started yesterday with ups and downs, and the market was quite stable. With the depletion of chips, buying interest was easily stimulated. The Guangdong banks continued to support foreign exchange, so that although the Indian silver reported an increase, there was still an upward trend. The one-day settlement slightly rebounded. In the early morning, due to the consistent rise in overseas silver markets, the forward silver price in Montreal even rose by more than one point, and the exchange rate rose slightly. The price of raw gold in London fell by one penny, and people's hearts continued to weaken. Over-the-counter pre-market trading opened, retreating to 84.5 yuan, and supply exceeded demand, falling back to around 3 yuan. The central bank's listing was announced, with the British price unchanged and the American price rising. The customs gold unit fell by 1 li, and the gold standard retreated to 834.6 yuan. The morning opened with a low market, but although the Jewish broker Cho Zhifubu was plugging, the banks were still supporting, and it rose. Large households took advantage of the high price to sell, anticipating that HSBC's listing would show the British price unchanged and the American price rising by 0.0625, with a slight downstream. However, because the Guangdong banks were vigorously supporting the pound, the foreign exchange market tightened and rose again. The banks took advantage of the high price to force the sale, and rumors such as the arrival of spot goods and the expectation of high silver prices fueled the selling sentiment, suddenly turning weak and falling. However, because large households took advantage of the low price to buy in, the table was depleted, and the price repeatedly rebounded after the low. Finally, the foreign exchange market stabilized, and the market turned to a hovering trend. The later market initially reported an increase of 14 annas in Indian silver and then fell, but because the London market was ordinary, buyers took advantage of the low price to move, and rumors of favorable news caused a buying spree due to the extremely depleted supply, skyrocketing rapidly. Although the price fluctuated after the high, the domestic market tightened due to the Guangdong banks' vigorous support for the US dollar, and the price rose. The banks took advantage of the high price to sell, and large households also sold, but the buying interest was still strong. After that, there were repeated ups and downs, and the hovering was uncertain. The second return of Indian silver was small, with one anna having little impact. The in-house price fell slightly due to a large supply order, but the overall trend remained hovering. The entire day's market was very mediocre. With the swap approaching, the market lacked a large demand for supply. After recording the one-day market,</p>

The Guangdong banks vigorously supported the shilling, and the process gradually tightened.

The Bank of China was making exchange rate swaps, and the trend was very flat, with a slightly firmer latent trend. In the early afternoon, the Indian silver reported an increase of 14.13 annas, and the exchange rate was slightly looser, but it was not easy to settle. After entering, the psychological state of the Chinese businessmen suddenly became brisk, and only the banks slightly made counterparties. Soon, the market turned flat again. The Guangdong band vigorously supported the US dollar, and the process gradually tightened. The banks still had supply and struggled a lot, and the second return of Indian silver was small, with each anna making the final bank mutually counterpart.

<h3 id="e196">Interbank Call Loan Interest Rates Remain the Same, Settlement Day is Sluggish <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>In the past few days, the silver dollar market has been sluggish due to the fact that many firms are in a wait-and-see mood, and the various quotations are like clichés, and there has been no progress or retreat. The interbank call loan interest rate in the market in the morning and afternoon is still 1.2 points, and the head addition and water addition are always made in vain, which is the same as the previous day, without any ups and downs. The transaction volume of the call loans was more than 3.3 million in the morning, more than 600,000 in the new transactions, and more than 200,000 in the afternoon. The transaction volume in the small general meeting was more than 500,000. The silver pawn transaction took back more than 300,000, and the new pawn transaction made more than 400,000. The banknote transaction collected more than 1.7 million, issued more than 600,000 circulation coupons, 500,000 annotated coupons, 200,000 for the customer, and 500,000 for the road remittance. As usual, the news of the bank's settlement should be booming at the beginning of this week, but it was affected by the market atmosphere, and it became more and more slack. Yesterday, foreign banks received more than 2.5 million in settlement bills, more than 2.2 million in various goods padding and other miscellaneous settlement, more than 500,000 in special remittances, more than 1.2 million in foreign exchange settlement, and 400,000 in warehousing. Chinese banks received more than 2.5 million in settlement bills, more than 2.8 million in various goods padding and other miscellaneous settlement, more than 700,000 in special remittances, more than 1.4 million in foreign exchange settlement, and 200,000 in warehousing.

<h3 id="e198">Securities: The Narcotic Bond Market <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Chinese Merchant Exchange showed no signs of recovery. The market hovered sluggishly, further deepening its woes. Most speculators were consequently apathetic, leaving the market without any ripples. However, yesterday's developments seemed to indicate some underlying motives. For instance, the continuous selling of Securities No. 4 and No. 53, as well as from the Northern faction, was steady and unhurried, suggesting a planned sell-off taking advantage of market stability. Furthermore, short covering was not occurring due to thin profits, and large short sellers remained unmoved. It is predicted that the bullish camp will falter first, leading to market fluctuations. Observing the trading dynamics of the four sessions yesterday, although still sluggish, a sense of enervation was palpable. Trading was more active in the morning, while the afternoon market became almost narcotic. The majority of securities showed no price movement. Only a few varieties experienced slight fluctuations, with a difference of only five cents. Transactions were still clear, and aside from a few securities with no trades, those with any trades at all were listed on just one board. In summary, the daily market results showed more declines than gains, with amounts ranging from five cents to ten cents. Many securities maintained the same price as the previous day, showing no difference whatsoever. The total trading volume was 4,890,000 yuan, with the "96" securities accounting for 2,200,000 yuan, still nearly half of the total. A comparative table of the increases and decreases is listed below (unit: yuan, trading unit: 100 yuan):</p>

<p>The yarn market fell in the morning but recovered in the afternoon. Actual demand was still relatively strong. The southern regions continued to actively purchase coarse yarn, and the market slightly rebounded. However, the delivery issues for this month still left people confused and uncertain. It is said that Yuan Da, a major bull, has over two thousand bales due this month, so the near-term market is still fluctuating.</p>
<p>Golden Rooster's Future Improves</p>
<p>The marked yarn market opened with near-term declines, but the bulls remained unmoved. The far-month prices rose by twenty to thirty cents. Although new sellers in the market were not very active in the first two to three rounds of trading, the bulls did not step in to buy. At the same time, the cotton market softened, and a sudden drop occurred in the third round of trading, with a slight downward trend. As a result, prices for all months fell by four, five, or six cents compared to the previous day's closing price. The afternoon opening was normal. After the second and third rounds of trading, the market suddenly improved. The business of the "Kai Ke" group (buyers from other provinces) developed, and buyers from Guangdong and Hunan were particularly active, with purchases estimated at over two thousand bales. The market sentiment was strong. As a result, prices for all months rose by two, three, four, or six cents compared to the morning's closing prices. It was found that Tong Ji sold 250 bales, Da Ji sold 250 bales, Yuan Yi sold 350 bales, Tong sold 400 bales, Da Feng sold 400 bales, Run Kang sold 1,800 bales, Da Chang sold 350 bales, and Xin Hua sold 300 bales. Yuan Da bought 650 bales, Jun Chang bought 500 bales, Chang Yu bought 650 bales, Ren Feng bought 600 bales, Shen Ji bought 650 bales, Yuan Yi bought 650 yuan, and Yong Da bought 400 bales. The daily high and low prices and closing prices are as follows:</p>
<p>Marked Yarn	Highest Price	Lowest Price	Closing Price	Change	Balance</p>
<p>May	173.3	172.9	173.3	Down 0.30	31,650</p>

<p>Total	191,300</p>
<p>Active Yarn Sales Seen</p>
<p>Sales of current yarn are very active. It was found that various groups bought a total of 2,105 bales throughout the day. Market prices did not fluctuate much. The purchases of various groups are as follows:</p>
<p>Guangdong 1,600 Inland 60 Guangzhou 10</p>
<p>Changsha 235 Shantou 80 Xuzhou 25</p>
<h3 id="e200">Northern Cotton Receives Rain, Marked Cotton Returns to Decline <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>After continuous gains in the cotton market, a correction occurred due to rainfall in some areas of the north. The Jin merchants, who were bullish, also released their holdings to cash in. Furthermore, there were reports that a certain bank would deliver several thousand dan this month, so the recent downward trend was more intense. However, Yuan Da, a major bull, continued to increase his leverage, maintaining strong upward pressure.</p>
<p>Near-term Zheng Marked Most Received</p>
<p>The marked cotton market opened with declines across all months. Because US cotton prices were close to 12 cents, southern cotton farmers and cotton ginners engaged in short covering. Although market prices had previously risen, Indian cotton remained expensive, and silver prices rose again while gold prices remained flat. Furthermore, there were reports that the banking sector would deliver cotton this month, and because cotton for this month was of a higher grade than cotton for the following month, deliveries were expected to be strong. Also, several areas in the north received rain, easing market sentiment. As a result, prices for all months fell by 15 to 30 cents compared to the previous day's closing price. The afternoon opening was relatively flat, and because winter players continued to buy and increase their positions, the trend was upward. However, in the third round of trading, there were reports that demand from current cotton mills was weak, and selling pressure increased again. As a result, prices for all months fell by 5 to 15 cents compared to the morning's closing prices. It was found that Han Ji sold 1,000 dan, Jun Chang sold 1,300 dan, Tong Xing sold 1,000 dan, Yuan Yi sold 2,000 dan, Run Kang sold 2,400 dan, Yong Chang sold 2,600 dan, Xin Heng sold 1,200 dan, Yi Kang sold 1,900, Da Chang sold 1,100 dan, and Chang He sold 4,100 dan. Yuan Da bought 5,900 dan, Yi Yu bought 1,800 dan, He Xing bought 1,100 dan, Yi Feng bought 1,200 dan, Chang He bought 2,100, Geng Feng bought 2,100 dan, and Yuan Yu Chang bought 1,100 dan. The daily high and low prices and closing prices are as follows:</p>
<p>Marked Cotton	Highest Price	Lowest Price	Closing Price	Change	Balance</p>
<p>May	33.85	33.55	33.60	Down 0.35	113,700</p>
<p>June	34.35	34.10	34.10	Down 0.35	178,600</p>

<p>Total	695,000</p>
<p>Weak Demand from Raw Cotton Mills</p>
<p>The current cotton sales market is very quiet, and demand from mills is sluggish. The sources included Yao cotton, 250 bales; Tongzhou cotton, 547 bales;</p>

<p>(Bombay) The cotton trend remained firm last week. However, apart from old cotton being firm, new cotton transactions were scarce. The recent price surge prompted large-scale liquidation by well-known bulls. However, due to insufficient inventory, operators continued to buy White Rashi cotton for July-August delivery at 250 rupees. Generally, market sentiment remained positive due to rising silver prices. However, the industry is waiting for developments abroad. Spot trading has gradually quieted down. Plum Gold Orum La and Gandhi Xu cotton were in good demand. There were also considerable exports to Japan. Although manufacturers inquired, transactions were difficult. The weekly statistics are appended below (unit: thousand bales):</p>
<p>1934 to Date	1935 to Date</p>
<p>Total Listings this Season	1,920	1,954</p>

<p>(Liverpool) Spot cotton transactions were moderate last week, and futures cotton was lackluster. Most of the early-week trading was by local operators. There were few sellers.

<h3 id="e202">Grains: Actual Sales Groups Spit Out Futures Flour <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the flour market opened in the morning, prices for various months showed a pattern of near-term declines and far-term rallies, but ultimately fell back step by step. With quotations for imported wheat, Chicago fell by about 1.24 cents, and Canada fell by 0.08 to 0.10 cents. When pricing began, imported wheat was quoted lower. The Tianjin-Beijing area also experienced heavy rain, and market sentiment there had already loosened. The customer groups, upon receiving this information, uniformly sold off after the market opened, causing prices to fall by two to three cents. However, in September and October, outside buyers actively bought in large quantities, supporting the market sentiment. Afterwards, customer groups sold, while outsiders bought in, and the strength of both forces was substantial. Trading volume reached over 800,000. However, once the actual sales groups sold, market sentiment turned weary. When the market opened in the afternoon, because the actual sales groups returned to selling, market sentiment was uniformly bearish. Buyers were not as active as in the morning, and the market fell back step by step. If the actual sales groups continue to be bearish, prices may fall further. As a result, the current month fell by 4.75 cents, June-July fell by 4.25 cents, August fell by 4.75 cents, September fell by 4.25 cents, and October fell by 3 cents.</p>
<h3 id="e203">Sharp Decline in Futures Wheat <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the futures wheat market opened in the morning, prices for various months were flat and lackluster. With quotations for imported wheat, Chicago fell by about 2.14 cents, and Canada fell by 0.08 to 0.10 cents. When pricing began, imported wheat continued to decline. Although there were storms in local and outport areas, the extent of damage to the new wheat was unclear. Furthermore, imported wheat could continue to be ordered, so even if there were minor domestic issues, international trade could still proceed. Therefore, market sentiment was weary when pricing began, down two to three cents from the previous week. When the market opened in the afternoon, because the decline in the flour market was frightening, and news spread that another ship of Australian wheat had been booked at 4.75 yuan, market sentiment uniformly loosened. Although trading was not very active, the decline was substantial, reaching about 10 cents. It is observed that during the new trading period, the fluctuations are huge, and because the stakes are high, market sentiment is easily swayed. As a result, the current month fell by 10 cents, August fell by 11 cents, and September fell by 11 cents. The current wheat market has stabilized, and deliveries are still active. Shandong wheat opened at 4.10 yuan, Suzhou wheat at 4.05 yuan, and Henan Jiangbei wheat at 3.98 yuan. A total of 3,000 bags were sold, with Fuxin taking 2,500 bags and Fufeng taking 500 bags.</p>

<p>Imported rice prices weakened due to strong arrivals in recent days. Yesterday, another 80,000 bags of small broken rice, No. 3 Saigon rice, and broken rice arrived. More are expected to arrive in the coming days, causing great market anxiety. However, the domestic warehouse removals showed signs of turnaround yesterday. 8,000 bags of spot imported rice and 700 tons were moved yesterday, mostly for domestic shipment. New arrivals of high-grade Saigon rice were limited, and there were inquiries from local traders, stabilizing the market. Only the prices of No. 3 Saigon rice and small broken rice fell by six to seven cents to one dime. Customer accounts remained stable due to scarce goods. However, Sichuan machine-milled rice was welcomed by local traders, and prices rose by five cents yesterday.</p>
<p>Dumi (South Shanghai) Although the customer groups' sources were interrupted by a one-day market closure yesterday, arrivals were not very strong. A total of thirty-five to thirty-six boats arrived (totaling over 7,000 shi). The local market sales started as a result, and customer groups' purchases also suddenly included six to seven hundred bags from Tianjin, Beijing, Yantai, and other groups, stimulating the market. Market sentiment tightened. However, the market prices had been weak for too long, and there was no significant improvement in the short term. Except for a slight rebound of a few cents in Nanyang early rice, prices for other Suzhou and Tongjing rice, as well as various late rice varieties, showed no change, remaining in a stable but tight situation. Also, various grades of Yin Bian Yuan and Lujian rice showed no significant decline. (North Shanghai) Yesterday, about twenty boats arrived from various routes in Hexia. Sales of various goods in the market were flat. White japonica rice remained stable with a weary undertone, early thin rice was down about one dime, high-grade white yuan rice was stable but secondary grades were weary, and other goods also showed signs of weakness.</p>

<p>The fresh broad beans from Wenzhou that arrived the day before yesterday were bought by the Tianjin group at prices of 3.60 yuan and 3.50 yuan. Another batch is expected to arrive on Wednesday, and production in that area is abundant this year, so market sentiment is bearish. In the past two days, the Guangzhou group's sesame sales market has suddenly become active (with 1,700 bags of various sesame varieties sold on Sunday), causing market prices to rise by one dime. Yesterday, 660 bags of Haozhou sesame opened at a price of 6.63 yuan, 370 bags of Nanjing sesame opened at 6.70 yuan, and 400 bags of Mingguang sesame opened at 6.10 yuan and 5.90 yuan. The soybean market is witnessing increased sales of bean cakes (with over 10,000 pieces of various bean cakes traded in the city), leading to a surge in sales. A total of eighteen to nineteen carts of various soybeans were traded. Although market prices opened at the original level, market sentiment appears stable.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the first batch of fresh Qimen black tea opened at various tea shops, with an initial price of 160 yuan. Due to high exchange rates, prices were 40 yuan lower per load compared to last year. Chinese tea merchants are very disappointed with this market situation, which is quite unfavorable. Green tea sales also showed no significant improvement. Tianyu, Huacha, Yulong, and other firms bought over boxes of Suian Shangzhuang Zhenmei tea, and market prices did not fluctuate much.</p>

<p>Previously, it was reported that Xinghua longan sprouts were poor, and it was expected that this year's harvest would only be 20% of normal. However, the weather has been favorable recently, and the situation has slightly changed. According to field visitors, the situation in Xianyou has improved slightly, and Putian is also better than before. It is estimated that a total of 30% of the crop can be harvested, but this is still 50% to 60% less than last year.</p>

<p>Sales of white striped tribute cloth have increased significantly recently. Tailoring shops have continued to purchase, causing market sales to suddenly become active. Yesterday, the wholesale price of No. 1 striped white tribute cloth was 5.50 yuan per yard, No. 2 was 5.00 yuan, and No. 3 was 4.75 yuan.

<p>The tinplate market showed signs of recovery again yesterday. Although cigarette factories, printing factories, and thermos factories have reduced their purchases, alcohol factories have suddenly started hoarding, and stinky water factories have also re-entered the market. There are quite a few buyers, reversing the previous trend. The market standards are maintained and prices did not fall. However, the spot price of 90-pound double-length Italian tinplate has risen alone due to a large shortage. The current price is 29.25 yuan per box, up 0.25 yuan from before. In addition, 90-pound English tinplate opened at 14.25 yuan, 200-pound Huisi tinplate opened at 29 yuan (old American steel factory goods), 28.50 yuan (new steel factory goods), 27.50 yuan (unofficial goods), and 26.75 yuan (Japanese goods). 90-pound double-length German goods also opened at 28.50 yuan.</p>

<h3 id="e210">On Popular Literature <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>— Xia Shi</p>
<p>Now is the era of "popularization."</p>
<p>However, the general public seems to retain the traditional concept of the term "popularization" and often misunderstands it. Take literature, for example. When popular literature is mentioned, it is assumed to cater to low-level tastes, different from and even opposed to the pure literature of scholars and celebrities. This is the same view as the Book of Han's "Treatise on Literature," which sees novels as "created from street gossip and hearsay."</p>
<p>In fact, the current meaning of "popularization" should not be like this. It is not about catering to low-level tastes, but about raising the level of general readers' tastes. Popular literature and pure literature becoming opposing terms originated when literature was seized by a few. Those few scholars, in order to flaunt their profound knowledge and prove that the general public was unworthy of approaching literature, called works that originated from or catered to the tastes of the general public popular literature, indicating that they could not be classified as orthodox literature. However, the upward development of the general public's life finally inspired the consciousness of demanding literature. They were not satisfied with low-level tastes. They wanted to break through that artificial barrier and enter the "palace of art." Therefore, the popular literature movement that arose from this is clearly different from the previous view. It is not about establishing a separate school, but about fundamentally making literature a universal thing. Otherwise, why don't we call Zhang Henshui and Bu Ken Sheng popular literature writers? Why don't we recognize *Tixiao Yinyuan* and *Jianghu Qixia Zhuan* as works of popular literature?</p>
<p>"Popularization" refers to both content and form. Simply circling around in form cannot be considered popularization, and talking about content without considering form cannot be considered popularization either. *Jianghu Qixia Zhuan* is relatively simple in terms of writing, but because it expresses a low-level taste, we cannot recognize it as a work of popular literature. The difference between low-level taste and high-level taste lies in the fact that low-level taste is a stale taste without life content or incompatible with life content, while high-level taste is a taste felt from real life or that can strengthen life force.</p>
<p>In terms of content, "popularization" should be universal and positive. In terms of form, it should be concise and brisk. The purpose of popular literature is to make literature accessible to the general public. Therefore, the popular literature movement cannot be viewed solely from the perspective of popularization, but must be seen as the linchpin of the entire development of literature.</p>
<h3 id="e211">Country Road <a href="#e211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>— Lu Fen</p>
<p>Having moved more than a thousand li south, the climate is somewhat warmer, though I can't quite discern it yet. But the trees and wheat clearly indicate it.</p>
<p>A few years ago, I traveled this road often. No matter which end I started from, it always gave me a diligent kind of pleasure. Whether riding a donkey or taking a rickshaw, I was always happy, because I loved the countryside yet couldn't leave the city.</p>
<p>My hometown is on the green earth, on the lush plains, where no waterways run.</p>
<p>In such a world, the automobile is the only hero. A sign across the car's front reads: "Bound for Dongzhou," I don't know what it means. After weighing the luggage, a check at the city gate, and we were released. Seems quite impressive. But shortly after crossing the railway, this hero ran into a snag – its head was stuck under a bridge.</p>
<p>"Get out, get out..." A young driver opened the car door.</p>
<p>So everyone got out.</p>
<p>"Ah, what happened?"</p>
<p>A middle-aged woman poked half her head out of the car window. No one paid her any attention.</p>
<p>Somehow, one of the car wheels had fallen into the water, gone for a bath.</p>
<p>So, repairs. Oil can, pliers, wrenches were all brought out. Villagers held rice bowls, village children stuffed their mouths until they bulged, and crowded around, as if watching an animal that had died by the roadside.</p>
<p>The driver, eyes bulging, raised a forefinger and shook it in the air, cursing:</p>
<p>"Damn you good-for-nothings, get lost!"</p>
<p>The villagers looked at each other, and silently dispersed, because the car company was government-run, and a wheel had fallen into the water; it was best not to provoke them.</p>
<p>During travels, we often encounter unpleasant pleasantries, such as insults and beatings. People probably don't love peace as much as they sing, living in constant and unchanging circumstances, they feel an innate unpleasantness, depression, or predicament. When someone starts an argument, others are naturally happy to watch, as long as it doesn't involve them. Not even a single hair is allowed to be plucked. However, it doesn't work that way. In a car or on a boat, being jostled and kicked is inevitable; listening to others argue makes it difficult to have peace and quiet. Travelers often hope that something unusual will happen, but only as long as it doesn't interfere with them.</p>
<p>Luckily, people climbed back into the rectangular box. Thirteen in all, five of whom were "our people," riding without tickets.</p>
<p>"My eyes are going to cry themselves blind, drive faster. You want the horse to run well, but you don't want it to eat... you have it easy!"</p>
<p>The postal worker spoke with a Beijing accent. He had a child-like round head, and a naive smile floated on his full face.</p>
<p>Another rogue-like young companion, for some reason twisted his face to the side, and tapped his knee with two fingers, saying:</p>
<p>"As for you: hugging thighs."</p>
<p>The driver leaned his upper body forward, the hero roared and trembled again, woo, woo, woo! And so everyone swayed. Under the postal worker's fleshy lips, shiny droplets dripped, and he started to snore.</p>
<p>Along the way, the car was popping like firecrackers as it cursed at the oxcarts.</p>
<p>The car was full of wind, overflowing and splashing, running wild on the vast plains, racing on the felt of tender green.</p>
<p>Poplars, willows, villages, fertile plains, sliding backward. Green, green, green, a vast sea. A flash of trembling, fiery peach blossoms, smoky pear blossoms, egg-yellow vegetable fields… sliding by. A bump, and delicate shadows fall over us… mottled cloth pieces, open to the wind, flutter and jump. Village girls wring their hands, laughing and talking, laughter echoes in the green… Clang! A bucket is lowered into a well. A hen, elegant and calm, retreats in surprise from the road into the wheat field. Piglets wag their ears, and waddle towards the pond. Disappeared. Poplars, willows, villages, fertile plains…</p>
<p>…The city gate had collapsed tiles, and on the wall was a large white character: "National Goods Gate." The journey naturally came to an end here.</p>
<h3 id="e212">Seeing A-Bao Off From the Golden Age (Continued) <a href="#e212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>— Zikai</p>
<p>Every time I go to Shanghai, I bring back some sweets to share with the children, adding to the family's happiness. A large part of the children's anticipation of my return lies in these "goodies." You have always been one of those who eagerly awaited these "goodies." You once competed with your siblings to see who would be the last to finish eating; you once collected the colorful gold and silver tinfoil and made them into gorgeous handicrafts, making your siblings envious. How could you now even think of hiding your own share and giving it all to your siblings? I saw you divide it evenly for them, expressing great joy, just like when you won the competition to be the last to finish eating. I couldn't help but lean on the window and laugh to myself. Because I remembered your childhood: ten years ago, you were a troublemaker in our family, crying several times a day for unmet demands, and getting beaten by your mother several times. You only ate the yolks of eggs, not the whites. If your mother accidentally put a piece of egg white in your rice bowl, you would scatter the rice grains and egg white all over the table, while shouting, "Want yolk! Want yolk!" You thought that anything good was called "yellow." So once when you wanted a small chair to play with, your mother gave you a small stool, but you shouted, "Want yellow! Want yellow!" You looked down on Ruan Ruan, who was two years old at the time and could barely move. When eating, you would save the bad stuff for Ruan Ruan; when telling stories, you would assign the unlucky roles to Ruan Ruan. When your mother refused to grant you a request, you would loudly ask: "Wrong Ruan Ruan? Wrong Ruan Ruan?" You meant that Ruan Ruan was no good and her requests could be denied; but A-Bao was an extremely important person, so how could her requests not be granted? The reason for the refusal must be that Ruan Ruan had been mistaken for A-Bao. So you would loudly remind your mother each time, insisting that she recognize A-Bao's true identity and grant all her requests. This troublemaker who only "wanted yellow" and specialized in bullying the weak, is now sacrificing his own happiness to increase the happiness of his siblings. Seeing this makes me feel both amused and sad. All your former ambitions and dreams have been declared a failure. You have begun to restrain your own demands, endure your own desires, and seek the happiness of others; you are about to leave your ego-centric golden age and begin to taste the bitterness of human love.</p>
<p>I remember one day last year, I had to leave home for a long journey for necessary business. In the past, whenever I had to go out, you would all be unhappy, trying to stop me or asking me to return early. Even earlier, I had to sneak out without you knowing. Later, when your brother couldn't find me, he would cry several times. When I returned, if you knew the date, you would often come to the door or halfway to meet me. The painting I made with the title "Papa Won't Come Back" was based on you and your brother waiting for me to return home. Because in the past ten years or so, I had considered you as the solace of my life, telling you stories, playing games, and eating snacks with you every night, making you all feel the warmth of family life. You couldn't do without a father, so you wouldn't let me leave home. On that day last year when I had to go out, your siblings still bid me farewell and asked me to return early. I thought you would do the same, and was about to ask you when I should come home and what things I should buy, but unexpectedly you advised me to leave early and return late, saying that you had all sorts of ways to distract your siblings from stopping me and waiting for me. It turned out that you had overheard me and your mother talking and knew that I needed to leave early and return late on this trip, and you had decided to share the hardships of life for me. I felt relieved on this trip, but I also felt sad. Because my family was about to lose a happy child of the golden age.</p>
<p>The above are all things of the past, but they are often imprinted in my mind, making it impossible for me to forget. Now, you are a middle school student, and soon you will leave the golden age and step into the world of adults. I feel that this journey is more important than getting married. An ancient poem about seeing a daughter off to be married says: "Raised by elders since childhood, two farewells cause endless weeping. This binds the heart, righteous journey hard to return." Your "righteous journey" out of the golden age is actually even harder to "return" than getting married, so how can I not "bind my heart"? Therefore, I am now recalling my feelings and writing this article to see you off. The place you are going to is the world depicted in this collection of my paintings. I am very worried about this trip of yours. It's like marrying you off from the side of loving parents to the house of an evil mother-in-law, just as the previous poem says: "Trained within the confines since childhood, serving the mother-in-law brings me worry." What kind of attitude to take when serving the mother-in-law, I find it difficult to decide for you. But I hope you will strive to love yourself and not bring me worry.</p>
<p>About ten years ago, I made a collection of books depicting your golden age. (Zikai's Book Collection). In its preface (To My Children) there were the following words: "My children! I yearn for your lives, more than once a day! I want to express it tactfully, so that you yourselves may know. Unfortunately, by the time you understand my words, you will no longer be the people who can make me yearn. What a sad thing this is! "But your golden age is limited, and reality will eventually be exposed. This is the situation I have experienced, and it is the situation that all adults have experienced. I have seen the heroes and good men among my childhood companions shrink, submit, compromise, and yield, to the point of becoming like sheep. I myself am the same. Later generations will view the present just as we view the past, and you will soon have to walk this path too!" The scene of writing these words is still vivid in my mind, and now you have indeed "understood my words," and you are indeed about to "walk this path"! Impermanence is swift, thinking of this again, how can I not "bind my heart"! (End)</p>
<h3 id="e213">Untitled <a href="#e213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>— Juan Shi</p>
<p>It rained all day again.</p>
<p>Sitting in the room, there's nothing to do except read, or else listen to the sound of the rain, approaching from afar and finally pouring down in torrents. When this sound winds its way into this lonely room, when it draws near me and makes me look up, the window becomes tightly entwined with a very melancholy, very bleak scene. Grey clouds, looking utterly bored, tightly cover everything, and large raindrops scatter randomly on the already dim glass. But what is especially desolate is the steamboat whistle in the rain, a sharp, mournful whistle, coming from the steamboat docked on the little river across the way, originally meant as a signal for departure, but unexpectedly bringing an uncontrollable sense of sorrow to some unrelated people. After one sound, another follows, and the dust of the rain continues to sprinkle on the windowpane. In the thin cold, I see two shivering sparrows flying into the sky, everything lacking the brightness of spring, the radiance of midday, and so people seem particularly melancholy.</p>
<p>The small room, when the dark clouds began to spread, had already lit the lamp. One side was still invaded by the faint light of the uncompletely retreated daylight, thus blending into a very dim but very charming scene. The silent furniture, at this time of day, should have been covered with the golden light of the sun, and the person sitting on it should also have a mood as sunny as the weather, smiling leisurely. But now, instead of sunlight, there is only lamplight, which gently strokes every corner of the room with a pair of charming fingers, soft, but also weak, coupled with the bookshelf full of books, the messy packages, the whitewashed walls, creating a very lingering mood.</p>
<p>In my hand is a play by Chekhov, and with tired eyes I capture the man's wisdom from between the lines. When he pours out everything that is hidden in his heart, I have a strange feeling of being lost. The book tells the story of a person whose youth has passed, and after spending his whole life in foolish efforts, some faint sparks suddenly ignite in his heart.</p>
<p>Thus, he makes desperate, presumptuous demands, and finally all his dreams vanish like bubbles. The strings of life, after experiencing reality, relax lazily. He thinks he still has to live on, so he uses numbness and boredom to pass the days that follow. Holding the heavy book, I imagine this middle-aged man spending another twenty or thirty years in that old garden, in that desolate house, and then dying without resistance. Some hot tears, like spring rain, swirl in my eyes.</p>
<p>People cannot have ideals, cannot have yearnings, those are just games for the idle. When you are young, you may have good dreams, round dreams like the spring moon. The person who is dreaming is always happy, cut off from everything outside, wandering in the illusory mirage, of course, this good dream can be extended for ten or twenty years, because for this pathetic creature called mankind, there should be a short period to enjoy this tragic grace. And so he lives like this, this illusion gradually leaves him, like a friend saying goodbye forever, perhaps gradually moving away, or perhaps suddenly disappearing without a trace, but it is all the same. And so this period ends for him, at first there should be struggling, but that is also so weak, pitiful struggling! Slowly he puts down his hands and waits quietly for fate to embed him in a stereotyped mold. Later he dies, his eyes, which have gazed upon many faces of life, close, he no longer struggles, he is quiet. At that time, if death has not rendered him unconscious, a feeling may arise in his heart, which may not be the same for everyone, but may not be very different either, and that is: "I have already lived, I never knew that life was so plain!"</p>
<p>Surrounding me, behind me, to my left and right, are all grey shadows of grey phantoms, all a pitiable, helpless, silent group. I can't bear it anymore. When will I be able to open the window and bathe in the golden sunshine? The raindrops just keep falling, falling, the raindrops flatten my hope.</p>
<p>This man has only the appearance of a gentleman, and can only frighten birds.</p>
<h3 id="e214">Rain (3) <a href="#e214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>— He Wei</p>
<p>Clouds and fog blocked his view and locked his heart. His thoughts seemed to float in mid-air, blown by the wind into scattered pieces, drifting and swaying, with no end in sight. He felt cold and hungry. The whole morning passed, the whole afternoon also passed, and night had already filled the entire earth, but his uncle and the others were still nowhere to be seen.</p>
<p>The doors of Juanzi's house were tightly closed, and had not been opened since his uncle went inside. The village was asleep in the wind and rain, with only the sounds of chickens and dogs barking. The rain kept falling, rustling, rustling, truly making one uncomfortable. When he saw the smoke rising from the rooftops of the village, gradually blending into the depths of the clouds and fog, Tianli really couldn't stay alone in the pavilion any longer. He looked at that house with its heavily locked doors, feeling both angry and hateful, wishing he could kick his way into the courtyard inside those high walls and, no matter what the old woman said, pick up Juanzi and leave.</p>
<p>He walked slowly along the ridge, sticking his head out from under the umbrella and looking ahead. Although the ridge was made of stones, it had fallen into disrepair over the years, and there were mud puddles everywhere, making it very difficult to walk. He remembered that when he was younger, he had walked this short ridge with Juanzi side by side. They carried the same umbrella, pressed close together. Sometimes she would walk very fast, snatching the umbrella and running forward, making him chase after her, getting soaked in the rain; sometimes she would walk very slowly, making him follow her as if she were a female character in an old opera with bound feet. Her temper was fickle, and she would often stop for no reason, as stiff as a frozen stone, and he would have to say many humble words before she would move again. One moment she would be singing, listening to her own singing, echoing in the valley; the next moment she would be in tears, watching her own tears mingle with the drizzle. So, even though it was only a short low ridge, the little girl's affection and sweetness were enough to savor.</p>
<p>"When will I be able to be together with Juanzi again?"</p>

<h3 id="e215">Law Student Fraud Case <a href="#e215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>— Chui</p>
<p>Lawyers have the mission of safeguarding human rights, so when people's lives and property are unjustly violated, lawyers can request relief from the court according to the law. Therefore, their authority is so great, their responsibility is so important, and their status is so superior. Therefore, their knowledge of the law is naturally very well prepared. For example, for crimes such as forging documents and obtaining property by fraud, they must know exactly which article and section of the law to punish, as if reciting family treasures. Unexpectedly, recently, two outstanding law students have committed the act of jointly forging documents and defrauding money, trying to taste the flavor of stepping into the legal net in practice, which is truly astonishing.</p>
<p>According to reports, a law school graduate named Yuan Haiguang needed funds to apply for a lawyer's certificate from the Ministry of Justice. He discussed it with his classmate Jiang Yuanling, but they could not find a way. They used two Xinhua Bank checks in the name of the law school alumni association to fraudulently purchase a typewriter from the British-owned Wenyi Foreign Firm, mortgaged it for eighty-eight yuan, and divided the loot for their own use. This is truly an absurd idea, disgrace to intellectuals, and the ultimate misfortune for university students.</p>
<p>Judging from the facts, these two university students, having the ability to study and graduate from law school, are now on the verge of failure. How could they be unable to find even one or two hundred yuan for the lawyer's certificate fee? Even if they didn't have it themselves, they could borrow from slightly wealthier relatives and friends. Such a legitimate purpose would not necessarily be absolutely refused by relatives and friends. Even if there was no other way, they could only wait for an opportunity or think of other ways to generate income. Why were they so impatient as to commit this act of fraud? Furthermore, the motive for this incident was to apply for a lawyer's certificate. It is said that the Ministry of Justice requires more than two hundred yuan to apply for a lawyer's certificate. How could defrauding only eighty-odd yuan be of any help? Moreover, the eighty-odd yuan was divided for their own use, so the claim of applying for a lawyer's certificate is also questionable.</p>
<p>As for poverty, it is a common ailment of the people of the Republic of China. Without poverty, one cannot become a good citizen today. But one must be poor with integrity, poor with decisiveness, and must not let poverty shorten one's ambition, or act perversely. One must still actively struggle and continue to work hard in the direction of the road and social environment in order to find a way out. As for forging documents and obtaining property by fraud, these are clearly acts of throwing oneself into the legal net and destroying one's own character. As the saying goes, scattering dirt behind the door does not prevent the dawn from breaking. In the end, there will be a day when the truth comes out.</p>
<p>Just think, Jiang used the law school alumni association's check to fraudulently purchase a typewriter from the Wenyi Foreign Firm. Although the Wenyi Foreign Firm could be deceived at a certain time, the foreign firm would definitely have to collect the cash from the Zhejiang Industrial Bank. Since it was forged, the seal would naturally not match, and the Zhejiang Industrial Bank would definitely refuse to pay the cash. If the foreign firm could not collect the cash, it would naturally have to investigate the source. Jiang and Yuan would ultimately have no way to escape punishment. This kind of simple fact was right in front of them, yet the two students were completely unaware, and were still rejoicing that their plan had succeeded. It is truly laughable. Even middle school students would not do this, nor would they want to do this. Yet, unexpectedly, a university student, and a law school student at that, would commit such an act. I cannot help but feel sad for the future of university students.</p>
<h3 id="e216">Death <a href="#e216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>— Tuoren</p>
<p>A few years ago, this aging P County still preserved the form of thousands of years ago. Everything was old, with no new tricks. Modern civilization had no shadow here, and scientific progress had not invaded here to leave any traces. Everything that had already leaped forward in the world and in the cities, in this ancient city, still had not left a single spark. Only the permanently unchanged face remained here. People lived as if they were in the Middle Ages. Things and all phenomena still had the characteristics of the Middle Ages. Everything seemed to live in stagnant water.</p>
<p>However, since a highway was built through here a few years ago, this ancient city has also changed. From that highway came all sorts of fresh, new things that the people living in this city had never seen before. They were surprised and felt novel, as if everyone was watching with eyes that did not believe themselves everything they thought was strange, fresh, and unimaginable. They were also conjecturing in their fantasies how beautiful the outside world was. When the automobile, which the people in this aging city could not even imagine in their fantasies, passed through here for the first time on the highway, everyone felt a special strangeness. Children were surrounded in groups around the car, looking with surprised eyes. The old men were even sighing with each other. They all said:</p>
<p>"Heaven and earth are really changing. All sorts of new things will appear. A car like this that doesn't need oxen or horses, or even people, is something that even in dreams you couldn't dream of having. How much effort did Kongming use to build wooden horses and wooden carts? People now are really smarter than Kongming."</p>
<p>Gradually, the things outside were transported by the cars that they thought were surprising. Food, clothing, and utensils poured endlessly into this city that had not changed from thousands of years ago to the present. People's lives were also attracted by the new things from outside, and</p>
<p>New things replaced the old. The aging P County already had a bit of new life ignited. However, the destruction of old things gave them a terrible phantom. This city, which relied on handicraft industry to live a medieval life, was all heading for bankruptcy.</p>
<p>A few years ago, the things they still thought were fresh, the new era that they were vigorously praising, although washing away their aging hearts over the years, although developing to the point of replacing everything, they were instead terrified. Everything they had, the nourishment for their lives, was taken away by the cars running on the highway. So they felt sad, and started to hate the new things.</p>
<p>The terrible phantom, as dark as a forest at night, shrouded every corner of this already changed city, soaking into the depths of the hearts of everyone living here. All the thoughts of the initial admiration, surprise, hope, and joy were covered by the terrible phantom, and what now occupied their minds was exactly the opposite. What floated back into their minds was the revival of the already dead life, the reappearance of the aging city and old things. Yes, those were already thought to be unsatisfactory, but those were still good, those were still able to increase the flames of their lives compared to the new things now. So the children no longer surrounded and watched the strange monster running on the highway, and the old men were no longer so surprised. They were sighing again, this sigh was covered with a layer of grey. They said:</p>
<p>"The grace that the new things give us is death. All the fire of our lives has been extinguished."</p>
<p>Alas! Hurry and go.</p>

<h3 id="e217">Alley <a href="#e217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>— Yafei</p>
<p>Ten years ago, I used to live in this alley. I never thought I would revisit this old place. However, the alley before my eyes is no longer what it was ten years ago.</p>
<p>I remember when we lived here, the watchtower outside was still intact, and an old drifter lived underneath. Apart from our house, which stood tall and alone, several houses in the alley had already become dilapidated walls, and some courtyards had been turned into vegetable or fruit gardens. However, in the dilapidated mansion of an imperial censor across from our house, there still lived a watchman from this street, an old fellow from Shandong. He was already in his forties but still didn't have a wife. According to him, his father was the gatekeeper of this censor's mansion.</p>
<p>This magnificent censor's mansion, I imagined in those days, was very prominent. Not to mention anything else, just the watchtower was impressive enough. Such an antique building is probably rarely seen nowadays! The bottom of the alley was paved with whole fine sandstone slabs, and the section at the street entrance was paved with a "penny stone." In front of the censor's mansion, the courtyard was paved with Tian Tai stones arranged into a very delicate "flat promotion of three grades." A "carp leaping over the dragon gate" was built on the gate tower, and a pair of stone horses were placed on both sides of the gate, how solemn it was! I once heard people say that in the late Qing dynasty, civil officials had to dismount their sedan chairs when passing by here, and military officials had to dismount their horses, but after the establishment of the Republic of China, this kind of scene disappeared.</p>
<p>The alley was very wide, and an eight-person sedan chair could easily pass through.</p>
<p>In the past, the alley was originally called "Censor Alley." No one knows when the name "Slum Alley" came about. I think perhaps after the censor retired to the countryside, he didn't want to keep the name "Censor" and felt that the words "Slum Alley" were too pleasant and too elegant, so he wanted to call it that...</p>
<p>It seems that when I was a child, the censor's mansion wasn't as dilapidated as it is now. The magnolia tree in the back garden was where my sister An and I picked flowers and chased butterflies. That old Shandong fellow, everyone called him Old Shandong. Although he was in his forties, his childishness was no less than ours. When he was free, besides drinking, he would play with us.</p>
<p>Childhood, as soon as I think of my already gone, unrecoverable childhood, I feel sad, because my childhood was gray, just like now, with nothing worth savoring. It's just like a gray dream, quickly flying away in my life.</p>
<p>But the gray dream of childhood still retains some innocence, so it still feels somewhat lovely. But now, what about now? Even this only innocence is gone: all that's left of reality is a mass of gray life!</p>
<p>Ah! I want to mourn my lost childhood here.</p>
<p>Time blew through my life like a hurricane: it blew away my childhood, blew away my youth, blew away my lovely companion, blew away my dear sister An, blew away...</p>
<p>Because of Sister An's death, I returned to the slum alley I had left ten years ago with a burst of grief. Now, revisiting the old place, the new sorrows are even deeper, and I feel like my life is like a lonely boat without a rudder, drifting in the vast ocean, and the only light of the lighthouse has now been completely extinguished. Moved by the scene, I can't help but burst into tears!</p>
<p>The slum alley is still the slum alley of ten years ago, but the situation seems even more desolate and shabby than it was ten years ago. The magnolia tree in the censor's mansion has also been climbed and broken into a few bare branches. Even the old Shandong fellow, although still barely alive, is so old and feeble that he is no longer as strong as he used to be. His miserable life is naturally imaginable. When I talked to him about the past, his dry and wrinkled eyes became a little moist.</p>
<h3 id="e218">Night Crossing of Ganzhu Shoal <a href="#e218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>— Ai Tu</p>
<p>Carried by the transport ship with the wandering heart of a prodigal son, I floated like duckweed across the bay and through the raging waves—my mood was really like a bird without a rope, with strings of wounds given to me by the darkness of the world floating in my heart, as if every event had left an unforgettable shadow on me.</p>
<p>(Another wandering son has returned.—Perhaps mother is thinking this. However, mother would at least remember the last time, about two years ago in the summer, when I went home, I hadn't completely shed my childishness. Jumping and skipping, although it could be said that I had left my hometown and entered society, wandering everywhere. However, my economic ability at that time gave me quite a bit of happiness and full of joy, so when I returned, mother, poor mother, welcomed me with tears: "Son! Don't be so impetuous, listen to people's guidance, even if you don't study, you have to do something. Look, you're sixteen years old, in another two or three years you should be getting married! You've been smart since you were a child, you shouldn't go down the wrong path!" Yes, mother missed me so much. But what about now? How have I wandered? A sickly, haggard, melancholic face, a body broken by the hardships of the journey, everything has changed. Everything has changed, perhaps, this appearance of mine, this pale face, can only increase mother's infinite sadness and tears.)</p>
<p>On the ferry, I was thinking so melancholically about endless stories, the faces of some familiar brothers, friends, and relatives, the bright faces of smiling innocent little sisters, lovely innocent smiles, which had carved indelible dreamlike shadows on my childhood life.—Thinking, thinking, there really are endless poetic and terrible predicaments in the life of a wanderer. Sometimes I'm so happy that even a small thing feels strange and great, but sometimes I feel like everything is haunted by terrible black demons. At those times, I always curse that life is simply a difficult and painful road, full of thorns and bitterness,—that's right, although I am so young, I understand many things. Now, it can be said that I have returned with a heart full of melancholy and pain.</p>
<p>When the ship sailed from the raging sea into the inland river, it was the time when blood-red sunset filled the western mountains, making it impossible for me to stop the melancholic tide of my thoughts. At this time, I could go up to the deck of the ship and stare at the blue, darkening sky. The golden light reflected from the calm sea, the sounds floating out from the lush forests on the shore, and the dense reeds swaying gently in the evening sea breeze, were like a poor daughter stranded on a deserted island. Sad, (the evening sea is just like this, containing infinite sorrow!)</p>
<p>Following the turning rhythm of the clock, the transport ship kept rolling out silver-white waves towards both banks. At the same time, my head also rolled with the turning rhythm, like the waves of the sea—after all, it is only at dusk that one realizes the mood of wandering, like an unfathomable melancholic picture.</p>
<p>When the wind floating on the sea gradually carried a cool breath, a shadow came to tell me habitually again—night was coming, and the sea stone gate of Ganzhu Shoal had arrived. At the same time, I remember that not long after the ship crossed Ganzhu Shoal, I should fall asleep, letting the transport ship struggle with the darkness, carrying our tired bodies, and when the beautiful and clear dawn hung in the east, my hometown would appear before my eyes.</p>
<p>When the ship arrived at Ganzhu Shoal, apart from the dark shadows of the mountains and forests on both banks, which seemed to bewitch like ghosts and demons, and a few sparse stars in the sky, nothing could be heard or seen. At this time, I heard a huge wave even bigger than the waves of the sea—Ganzhu Shoal is a place of sea stone gates, with several large rocks standing on the seabed, which can capsize ships at any time—indeed, this is a very dangerous place.</p>
<p>However, passing through this place smoothly and alarmingly, I looked uneasily at the road home. (The night brings melancholy thoughts!)</p>
<h3 id="e219">Notes of a Weary Traveler <a href="#e219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>— Ji Tuan</p>
<p>"When a person gradually grows older and the experience of life gradually accumulates, he will be tired of running on the path paved with the sharp stones of emotion; then, let him be called the weary traveler on the path of affection."</p>
<p>Finally, one time, I boldly told her these terrible words that I had long kept secret. Then I quickly turned my head—I was afraid to see her frightened, disappointed, and intensely hurt face; but a string of low monologues still couldn't escape drifting past my ear: "What are you saying—you, you're still very young. You—"</p>
<p>Yes, maybe I really am still very young; but young people have two strong legs and a bold heart, and they are brave to gallop on the narrow path of emotion; but I have a withered heart of a weary traveler, and why do I carry so much of the sunset mood of middle age?</p>
<p>Then I thought: Even if I am young in her mouth, natural reality everywhere gives me the threat of sinking. Perhaps her words are just a kind of tranquilizer for me, while the threat of reality is a kind of warning? If that is really the case, then I would rather abandon her deceptive, embellished, and anesthetizing tranquilizer, and more gratefully accept the valuable warning given to me by the phenomenon of nature. Because what the former comforts me is a kind of deception; while the latter, even if it frightens me, is also a very precious truth.</p>
<p>Yes, it is no longer the age of youth; it is already a weary traveler tired of running on the narrow path of emotion!</p>
<p>Opening the many books deeply closed in my heart that record the travels and adventures in the wilderness of feelings, those wheat-like records can no longer make people yearn for them; young people are curious and adventurous, holding a renewed and exciting heart, carrying a walking stick, carrying a food bag, and sometimes, perhaps carrying a compass and a small travel guide, and then they go alone to the wilderness of feelings in the human world. There are poetic clouds and flowers there, and there are also black skies before thunderstorms. Patiently crossing the steps of the journey, the times are also moving forward step by step; barren mountains and deep pits have been passed, and small streams and orchards have also been passed: the birds of spring are happy, and the trees of summer also have countless vitality, but now it is already autumn. The wilderness of feelings is not suitable for autumn travel, look at the boundless gray-yellow desert and the earthen mounds without water and grass.</p>
<p>So what is written in the traveler's travelogue are all terrible poems like nightmares, the traveler's courage is gone, and the traveler's youthful curiosity is exhausted. Putting down the walking stick and luggage, what he needs is no longer the search for wonders, but only ordinary, with no climaxes and no lows, as quiet as an old man in the countryside resting—sitting quietly in the sun to smoke a pipe and take a breath. The traveler is no longer young, nor does he have youthful curiosity: the traveler is tired!</p>
<p>It is no longer worth reminiscing and feeling sad. The wilderness of emotion will never be as magical as a garden. People live, and people also run on the small path of affection paved with sharp stones. And now, people are tired from constant fatigue, people need to find a path to return, people need to rest!</p>
<p>Let everything that has passed pass, and let everything that is to come come! In short, the journey back from running on the small path of emotion is already as tired as an old ox. Don't ask me about those nightmarish travelogues, and don't pull me back onto the rugged road of emotion—take a careful look at the weary face of the dusty traveler.</p>

<p>In "National Soul," there is a historical event of national revolution: Xu Xilin's assassination of Enming, an important official of the Qing government. Xiao Ying plays the role of Enming, and Zhao Dan plays the revolutionary youth Xu Xilin. When Enming goes out to review the troops and arrives at the parade ground, he is assassinated by Xu Xilin as soon as he gets out of the sedan chair. Zhao Dan's performance of the assassination scene was very successful! The indignant expression after being arrested and the magnanimous attitude of sacrificing himself were performed very realistically and movingly.</p>

<h3 id="e228">Design of Public Memorial Buildings <a href="#e228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>— Xiao Ang</p>
<p>In recent years, the construction of public memorials has become a trend in various parts of our country. However, the characteristics and spirit of these memorial buildings must be expressed through architectural skills. Therefore, their design aspect is very worthy of study. Generally, the design of a building must meet the following four principles. I will now elaborate on the design of public memorial buildings based on these four principles.</p>
<p>(1) Utility Generally, public memorial buildings, such as Zhongshan Memorial Hall, Martyrs' Memorial Tower, and Revolutionary Martyrs' Shrine, all have their special purposes and values. Therefore, the choice of location and style is a very important issue. If the selection is poor, its utility will be lost. Memorial buildings should be built in places with pleasant scenery and convenient transportation. The terrain should be high all around, and it is advisable to leave plenty of open space so that they can be seen from all directions. As for the style, many architects say that the architecture of Greece and Rome is very majestic and exquisite, and is most suitable for memorials. I think Chinese-style architecture is also very good. If you go to Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum in Nanjing and Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall in Guangzhou, you will feel that the architecture is magnificent, the project is vast, and the terrain is suitable, which is awe-inspiring. If you go to the Dunhuang Grottoes and Baima Temples, you will think of the prosperity of the Tang Dynasty's cultural relics and the majesty of the empire. These are all inherent Chinese architectural styles, but they do not lose their utility, and they are no less than Western architecture. Why don't architects glorify the inherent Chinese architectural style?</p>
<p>(2) Solidity Public memorial buildings must be particularly solid, lasting for thousands of years without damage, able to withstand the pressure of wind and snow, the ravages of people, the erosion of water and humidity, and the burning of fire. Therefore, the choice of building materials is also very important. Granite is the most durable material in the stone category. Marble is more expensive, but it is much more beautiful. Reinforced concrete is also very good. When it comes to solidity, it is second only to granite, but because it is cheaper, it is also widely used. Memorial buildings made of wood and copper and iron are the least common.</p>
<p>(3) Aesthetics In addition to utility and solidity, what can fully express the spirit of the building is to start from the aesthetic aspect. The form of the building and the color of the materials should be uniform to avoid being scattered. The structure should be varied so that it does not look stagnant. All buildings should be symmetrical to show that solemn atmosphere. The style should be unique to show seclusion and elegance. These are all to increase the aesthetics and attract people.</p>
<p>(4) Economy At this time of national crisis and increased pain, all public buildings may be simpler and more economical in order to save money.</p>
<h3 id="e229">Humble Opinions on Architectural "Methods" and "Calculations" <a href="#e229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>
<p>— Ouyang Gu</p>
<p>Regarding the records of architectural engineering "methods" in China, the Ministry of Works and the inner court of the Qing Dynasty have clearly promulgated them, and many craftsmen have followed them as procedures. However, the so-called "methods" in engineering are generally oral work that is passed on to apprentices by carpenters, and it is very difficult to say under the pen and ink. Therefore, the methods and rules promulgated at that time were actually algorithms rather than methods. Methods need to explain how to start, how to saw, how to plane, how to install... In short, explain "how to do", these are all living things. "Calculations" need to explain the quantitative principles of the structural part functions, including the relationship of all sizes and positions. For example, the Pythagorean theorem for the base of the wall base built by the bricklayers is originally simple plane geometry. If it is written out in words and added with some unclear and unsavory songs, wouldn't it be confusing instead? Our purpose is in architecture, not in mathematics, but we also need a concise and reformed "calculation" method. For example, the most accurate method for finding the circumference of a circle is "multiply the diameter by three point one four one six", but the average plasterer and carpenter use the "three three plus it" algorithm when calculating the circumference, which is too far apart. This kind of error is still superficial. If the number is large, "a hair's breadth error can lead to a thousand miles' loss", that would be terrible.</p>
<p>The changes in architecture are infinite. Whether it is an engineer or a plasterer and carpenter, they must understand the secret of extrapolating from one example. It is impossible to simply enlarge or reduce a certain building by one point or one inch. Because the length, width and height of each part of each building are independent and absolute, and cannot be used as a basis or ratio. Therefore, the "calculation" occupies a very important position in construction, and it must be accurate, and this is the reason.</p>
<p>Now, people who study architecture from a modern perspective pay attention to the important points, mostly in art and engineering, and ignore the two methods that our country originally had, "model room" and "calculation room". Here, it is also necessary to explain the special responsibilities of these two methods. The model room is similar to modern architects, and the main duty is design. The duty of the "calculation room" is more like the assistant civil engineer in modern times, who specializes in managing assistants who calculate materials. This algorithm also has many places that incidentally explain the "sample" aspect. Now, if we can also deduce the rules of the "sample" from the method of calculation, that would be a gratifying harvest.</p>
<p>Regarding the definitions and explanations of various parts of the building, this journal publishes "Architectural Jargon" in each issue, and its benefits are also great. It can make people who do not have a proper understanding of Chinese architecture not be very unfamiliar when they see these many strange nouns. In short, the creation of architecture is like the creation of all arts, and should not be restricted by all aspects. Those rigid "calculations" and armchair "methods" are like setting traps to destroy or bind the creativity of young architects, and at the same time, we must pay attention to "reviewing the old and knowing the new", thereby expanding knowledge and enabling a whole understanding of the architectural world, so as to open a new era in the history of Chinese architecture.</p>
<h3 id="e230">Past and Present Views of Architecture <a href="#e230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>— Xian Zhi</p>
<p>The development of architecture is mostly based on the prosperity of the city. In the past, architecture was developed on a plane. Today, most of it is pushed upwards, because the ground of the city is limited, and the development of buildings is infinite. If the city becomes more and more prosperous, then tall buildings will continue to grow taller. However, this kind of tallest building must be competent by experienced architectural experts, because not only the design must be precise, but also the smallest space must be used to create useful houses, and the latest and most economical equipment must be used. As for the appearance, we must also pay attention to the aesthetics. As shown in the picture, the building of a certain company in Seattle is one of the major buildings designed by architectural expert Mr. Klamon in the United States. The other buildings, such as the University of Washington and the Bank of California in the United States, were all designed by him. Mr. Klamon has accumulated thirty years of experience and built buildings worth more than tens of millions of US dollars. He has now come to Shanghai from the United States to cooperate with Mr. Peter, an engineer from the World Industrial Company. In the future, the buildings in this city, designed by the two gentlemen, will definitely have a new and perfect development. The address of the World Industrial Company is No. 668 Sichuan Road, telephone number 11778.</p>
