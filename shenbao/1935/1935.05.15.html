<h3 id="c14">英帝國外交討論與遠東問題 <a href="#c14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>— 星</p>
<p>日來英帝國各自治領首相以參加英皇登極二十五週年紀念之便。會集倫敦。討論帝國之將來外交對策。據路透社所傳消息。僅言此項討論意義非常重大。而自洽領各代表與英內閣方面意見已能一致。帝國之防禦問題。亦有具體之决定。此項談話。有關於遠東前途者。至深且大。吾人雖不能知其結論果爲如何。然根據英帝國各邦領袖平日之言論。近時各自治領外交政策之趨向。以及目前太平洋局面之轉變。此次談話之結果。則亦不難推知其一二。</p>
<p>不明英帝國內幕者。往往將大英帝國與倫敦政府混爲一談。而事實上倫敦政府之傳統政策。及目前需要。往往與帝國各國治頒之傳統政策及目前需要不相一致。大戰以後。自治領以曾派兵來歐。爲倫敦政府盡力。故倫敦政府於外交上國防上漸顧全自治頭之願望。尊重其意見。巴黎和會。各自治領派有代表。國際聯盟。各自治領之代表團與英國之代表團處平等之地位。及一九二一年之帝國會議討論英日同盟之廢除或延續問題。加拿大首相Meighen氏以一人之力。力排衆議。曾將倫敦政府所决定之親日排美政策。一手推翻。而提出英美華日四國共開會議解决遠東糾紛之意見。當時保守派如外相蔻仁亦因顧全帝國之全部利益。翻然改圖。而接受其意見。故一九二一年六月間之帝國會議。實爲華盛頓會議之先驅。微加拿大代表之努力。勢必英美交惡。日英聯盟。九國條約及四國協定均無由產生。而十年間之太平洋苟安局面。亦無由造成。蓋當時如依照倫敦政府之意見。美旣拒絕國聯。辱及英國。國際信用掃地。殊無與合作之可能。日本則自一九零二年興英締盟後。十年之間在遠束爲英國强有力之友邦。頗有賡續同盟之必要。然其後英在華盛頓會議巾所以願竟興美合作。實由自治領外交政策之成功。而倫敦政府之從其意見也。</p>
<p>倫敦政府之所以親日。而自治領政府之所以親美者。自有其地理及歷史之原因。决非偶然。而英國傳統上外交方針。則在保持英吉利海峽之安全。故凡有利於維持大陸均勢。及其海上覇權者。均願赴之。其願聯絡日本。卽所以免其東顧之憂。俾在歐陸方面多從容應付之餘裕。且對俄對德。英亦均需要日本予以助力。至於自治領之政治家則不然。對於歐陸問題。旣少注意之興趣。對於海峽安全。亦不視爲有關切身之利害而彼輩所威不安者。乃在英國海軍力之日趨式微。澳洲新錫蘭加拿大及南非等國。距離倫救有數千里之遙。大英海軍空軍不足保障其安全。此其一。大戰以後。日本崛起遠東。其海軍之力旣可南下而威脅澳洲新錫蘭。東向則又有危及加拿大之可能。且其經濟之侵略力。又甚猛烈。南非澳洲加拿大等處。紛紛排斥日貨。深慮日本將起反戚。而以對付中國者對付英帝國自治領。此其二。反之。美國與英屬各自治領之關係。則甚密切。加拿大爲自治領中最强有力者。而其人口。僅美國十分之。一其國內富源。大部爲美國資本所開採。美國海軍旣與英國平等。加拿大與美國更有同舟共濟之誼。卽南非澳洲新錫蘭各地。亦美國海軍勢力之可及。故如何可與美國敦陸邦交。利用美國之海上優勢。以濟英國海力之窮。此自治領當局所焦心考慮者三。也</p>
<p>英自治領之態度。賅括言之。爲求英美之合作。以防止日本之侵略。並欲以聯合外交。集體和平。代替武力外交同盟外交。具體言之。在歐洲方而自治領僅望國聯爲道德的合作機關。而不用武力。在太平洋方面。則希望華盛頓條約之系統繼續維持。使美與日不致衝突。使英興美言歸於好。保障諸國領士之安全。求太平洋上防禦之减輕。裁减軍備以减少火併之機會。蓋一旦火。併各自治領之存在將遭致命之打擊也。今英倫政府旣興自治領政府態度一致。則此後英國在遠東行動。將以英美合作爲前提。以維持華盛頓條約下之和平系統爲職志。殆爲必然之趨勢。十三年前有自治領之外交勝利。而後有華盛頓會議之召集。則此次英帝國外交談論。於遠束關係有何影饗。不言可喻矣。</p>

<p>（華盛頓）財長毛根韜今晚之廣播演說中、並無改變美國白銀政策之表示、毛氏雖未曾有何關於購銀計劃之確切宣布、惟亦曾言美國「將努力使白銀在幣制上更爲有用、因白銀爲世界一大部份人民所用之貨幣」云、財長之演說大半爲討論國際貨幣穩定之可能、關於此點彼曾表示、美國並非不願合作以穩定國際匯兌、惟殊不欲作無謂之犧牲、以致美國在世界市塲大受損失、總之「世界應知各國如皆準備使外匯穩定、則美國决不阻撓之、著吾人所處者爲旁觀者之地位所有貨幣戰爭皆非吾人所發起、然所受損失則難以數計、故他人不應責備吾人須負恢復秩序之責任、吾人目前所有舉動務須確知將不再失去吾人已經收回之利益、吾人亦並非不願穩定貨幣、惟各國如仍不能各守秩序、則吾人現在尚可不致受損、蓋吾人業已重訂幣價、以後尚可改變、並無束縛也云、」</p>
<p>惟毛氏亦力稱現在之美元甚爲穩固、因「政府之幣制政策、己使吾人脫離紛亂、且仍向前邁進、以達復興之境」云、毛氏並謂、美國如欲固定美元或再行貶值、儘可自由爲之、然美國所注意者祇爲保護合乎常態之對外貿易、並不欲覇佔一切世界市塲、故「吾人非但不欲競爭貶值、而且吾國之通貨已非常穩定循此進行、世界各國或竟能漸達實際上之穩定、未可知也、」惟所謂穩定、亦並非美國卽宣言不再改繼美元之黃金成分之意、蓋如及則無非將引起他國重新作貶值之競爭而已、毛氏績謂美國自當竭盡全力、以謀恢復世界之繁榮、惟亦不願任由操縱貨幣之國家損害美國、以岡自利、「吾人如計劃將來之國外貿易、務須先行决定是否願以貨物售諸不能償付貨價之主顧、吾人當然儘可多收價據、國際銀行家之願意辦理此種手續者亦不乏其人、然目前吾人所收取者爲鉅額之金銀現貨、此種現貨、除償付貿易差額之外、尚有他國之資本逃避來美、以求托庇於吾國穩定之通貨之下者、經濟家曾稱、吾人如盡收世界現金、則以後將再無國際貿易可言、然事實上吾人之存金雖已達前紀錄、而世界之金產亦增加甚速、尚有人反對吾人之金銀政策、稱之爲係使世界之大批金銀不能流通、惟吾人之幣制準備、固亦因此而得充實也愆期不付之債欵、當然不能作爲吾人通貨之準備、是則此種債欵、亦儘可稱之爲壅塞通貨、倘吾人不欲擇其二者之一而從之、則政府願擇以金銀償付國際間之差額耳、」財長亦曾批評前總統胡佛之政策、謂自一九一四年七月起至一九三二年底止、美國曾輸出貨物達四百七十萬萬美元之鉅、迄今此種貨欵未經償付老尚有一百九十萬萬元云、（十三日國民電）</p>
<p>（紐約）據垣街觀察、財長毛根韜今日對於美元之演說、乃爲美政府探聽歐洲各國有無穩定匯兌意思而發、金融界對於財長之演辭、一致失望、以財長旣未能表明政府對於白銀之態度、卽對於國家貨幣問題亦鮮明白叙述、某部金融專家以爲財長未能爲白銀另定一新價格、殊足令人失望、亦有人謂另定白銀價格、此爲總統之所有事云、又財長所稱美國於現行政策下、可獲得外國大量之金銀、多數經濟學家都不以爲然、蓋此種硬貨之不絕流入美國、足以引起他國金融之紊亂、尤其中國墨西哥秘魯等國所受之損害爲大、同時此等硬貨在美、亦將成爲不生產之物、惟一般商人對於政府有與他國共謀穩定匯價之意、大抵表示歡欣、蓋美元與他國貨幣匯價若能穩定、則大可恢復國際市塲之互信、財長演辭對於市塲將起何種影饗、現尚難判斷、蓋以白銀投機者對此大抵失望、同時美元穩定之後、金價必不致再漲、故購金者亦大都觀望不前也、（十四日國民電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）美國金融界對於財長摩甘索之演詞中、雖美國不願以片而行爲呆定美元價格、但亦不欲妨碍國際通貨安定之進行一語、認爲有坦直性質、殊出意料之外、若干觀察家以爲此語、意在將幣制安定問題置諸英國之前、蓋其所謂美國在安定方面不能單獨首先進行一節、不啻邀請美國合作進行也、聞糜氏發言之前、曾與羅總統愼重考應其所擬發之言論、故摩氏右認爲以政府全權代表之資格發言、參議員史勒爾素批評政府新措施、並中張立卽安定者、現批評財長言論、其言白、羅總統顯已改變其主張矣、羅總統前曾稱苟非達到一九二六年物價之標準、則渠不願考慮安定、今年一月羅總統在國會所發之議論、猶謂當時平均物價僅及一九二六年標準百分之七四·八、今財長乃有此言論、可見前後已不一致云、（于三日路透電）</p>
<p>巴塞爾　國際淸理銀行今日發表常年報告對於美國之白銀政策、大事攻擊略謂此種政策旣使用銀國家蒙其損害、復使國際匯兌爲之不穩、該報告書繼謂、假使國際間對於白銀之需要、眞如黃金同其稈度、則不必借助於人爲之動作、同時美國此種動作、究竟能否使白銀之國際地位發生根本變化、亦無微象之可見云、（十四日國民電）</p>

<p>一</p>
<p>一國經濟狀况之良　、恒可於其進出。貿易之順逆覘之、蓋凡入超之國、現金之流出必多、其結果每足以釀成經濟基礎之動搖、中國目前之恐慌、雖與美國購銀政策不無重大因果關係、然而根本致命傷、仍在每年七萬萬元左右之入超、致不得不輸出鉅量之現金、以資抵補、往者每年恃有海外華僑鉅額匯欵關係、（據美人雷穆氏佔計民國十九年、此項匯欵約計為三萬萬一千六百萬元、依鏡宙民國十六年之調查、僅英荷二屬華僑匯至厦門·汕頭·廣州等處之欵、年計已在二萬萬左右、如幷歐·美·澳·菲列濱·暹邏·安南·仰光·台灣·日本·朝鮮等處計之、當在四萬萬元至五萬萬元之間）、藉得抵償其大部分、故現金流出終屬有限、自世界經濟全部衰落以來、海外華僑破產相繼、已有岌岌不能自存之勢、更無餘資滙回祖國、而南美洲日本等處、更時有排斥華僑之不幸舉動、昔日所恃為維一入超差額之抵償者、今皆全歸烏有、遂不能不出於現金輸送之一途、以是年復一年、國內現金外溢日多、即無美國之購銀政策、亦必無法支持、不過白銀政策使銀價提高、於吾國出口貿易益不利、殊無異一道催命符而已、總之今日全國農村、整個破產、經濟基礎、全都崩潰、乃為歷年來鉅額入超之總結帳、非一朝一夕之故也、</p>
<p>二</p>
<p>進出口貿易形勢之順逆、關係一國經濟之重要、旣如上述、以言一省、何莫不然、甘省從前貿易之形勢如何、向無統計、無從知其大概、鏡宙自受事以來、鑒於此項統計意義之重大、乃從本廳稅收項下之各種稅票、分類核算、斷自民國二十一年起、計是年進出口貿易總值、為六〇·六九九·三〇七元、內出口貨值佔一四·六五六·一九六元、進口貨值佔四六·〇四三·一一一元、計入超三一·三八六·九一五元、二十二年份進出口貿易總值為八〇·〇〇〇·四七二元、內出口貨值佔一五·四一五·四六七元、進口貨值佔六四·五八五·〇〇五元、計入超四九·一六九·五三八元、二十三年份進出份貿易總值為六三·六五三·九八九元、內出口貨值佔二·二五二·三七二元、進口貨值佔四二·四〇一·六一七元、計入超二一·一四九·二四五元、總計輸出貨值、以二十三年份為最高、二十一年份為最低、輸入貨值、以一十二年份為最高、二十三年份為最低、入超額亦以二十二年份為最高、合計三年貿易輸出總值、僅五一·三二四·〇三五元、輸入總值達一五三·〇二九·七三三元、出入相抵、入超總額為一〇一·七〇五·六九八元、（此項進出口貿易、大部包括靑海在內）、約二倍於輸出、是不啻甘省人民於此三年中、於負担各項捐稅外、尚須支出比一筆巨額入超之經費、甘省人口、在寗靑未分省前、號稱九百萬、自分省後、約計已不過七百萬、年來天災人禍、死亡逃徙、人口銳减、據商務印書館二十三年出版之重編日用百科全書、甘省二十一年之人口統計、僅五·七六二·一〇九人、其數似較可靠、設以此為標準、每人三年間平均之負担、為十七元八角强、即每人每年平均之負担、為六元弱、據一般人之意見、此項入超之維一抵償、即為特貨之出口、然自本年起、已定五年禁絕計劃、第一期為臯蘭等十三縣、業已實行、此後甘省人民經濟、將益陷於危迫之境矣、至二十三年之貿易入超、所以較二十二年份减少二千八百餘萬之巨者、其原因不外下列一事、（一）農村破產、社會經濟日絀、人民購買力日减、商店積貨無法推銷、入口貨亦隨之减縮、（二）甘肅過去經濟、旣全恃特貨為活動之基礎、　十三年扮因受中央普遍厲行禁毒之影響、價格頓落、商人無利可圖、相率觀望、輸入亦因之而衰退、</p>
<p>三</p>
<p>總查上述甘省二年間貿易情形、其足資注意者數點、茲分進出口一縷述之、（一）入口入口貨中之最佔重要地位者、除雜貨不計外、首推布疋棉花、二十一年計值·八七四·六八〇元、佔入口總值中百分之一〇·五八、二十二年計值七·一六七·二三四元、佔入口總值百分之一一·一一、二十三年計值四·八三九·四四一元、佔入口總值百分之一一·四三、次茶類、合官茶散茶計之、（甘肅向有茶引、宛如江南之鹽引然、謂之官茶、人民自由販運者、謂之散茶）、二十一年為二·三五三·〇四〇元、佔入口總值百分之五·一二、二十二年為二·〇五七·六九〇元、佔入口總值百分之三·一九、二十三年為一·七六九·一二六元、佔入口總值百分之四·一八、次紙張、二十一年計值一·二六九·九五〇元、佔入口總值百分之二·七六、二十二年計值一。五六一·三二〇元、佔入口總值百分之二·五七、二十三年計值一·九七三·六·二〇元、佔入口總值百分之四·六七、次食品、二十一年計值六二三·〇〇〇元、佔入口總值百分之一·三五、二十二年計值八一〇·〇〇〇元、佔入口總值百分之一·二五、二十三年計值八二六·〇〇〇元、佔入口總值百分之一。九五、（附表從略）（二）出口出口以皮毛為最大宗、二十一年計值七·〇八八·六七〇元、佔出口總值百分之四八·三七、二十二年計值六·六四〇，一七二元、佔出口總值百分之四三·〇八、二十三年計值一〇·〇五八·一九七元、佔出口總值百分之五二·〇一、次藥材、二十一年計值四·八七九·一五五元、佔出口總值百分之三·二九、二十二年計值六·一一九七七元、佔出口總值百分之三〇·七五、二十三年計值七·〇五八·八五六元、佔出口總值百分之三三·二二、次水菸、二十一年計值一·一七五·〇九九元、佔出口總值百分之一四·八四、二十二年計值　·一七五·〇九九元、佔出口總值百分之一四·四一、二十三年計值一·八四一·七〇一元、佔出口總值白分之八·六七、（附表從路）</p>
<p>四</p>
<p>吾國入超之原因、則用之者衆、生之者寡二語、足以盡之、故今後欲减少入超、自應力求各種寧業之發達、又須坐而言起而行、方可有挽救之望、以目省論、其義正同、今試就上節所論各點而申述之、</p>
<p>（一）宜提倡植棉居甘省每年入口之首位者為布與棉、就最近三年間估計、每年入口平均之總值、為九百六十餘萬元、不可謂非一筆鉅大之漏巵、查西北適於棉作之區域甚廣、當此實行分期禁烟之際、尤非竭力設法提倡不可、茲已由中央棉產改進所、撥到種子二百担、此問題可謂正在發　中、不久當有相當之成效、可報告於關心西北問題諸君之前也、</p>
<p>（一）宜提倡小規棧造紙紙亦居廿省入口之次要地位、目逐年加增、均在三十萬元左右、此為甘省文化日漸發達之好現象、倘雨暘時若、交通便利、將來之需要益多、自必有取布棉而代之勢、查隴南隴西一帶、造紙之材料極富、似宜詳加調查、印具簡易造紙淺說、勸人民自由仿製、以資挽救、</p>
<p>（一）宜開辦毛織廠與製革廠皮毛出產、以甘肅最近三年間之出口統計觀之、皆佔百分之四十八弱、若專以二十三年一年論、則佔出口貿易全額百分之五十二强、其地位之重要可知、皮毛不特為普通服御所需、其在軍事上之價值尤大、自東北淪陷、所恃惟在西北、惟茲事體大、非有大規模之計劃不為功、甘省當殘破之後、財力已竭、恐不足以語此也、</p>
<p>（一）宜設製藥廠藥材產量、居甘肅出口中之次要地位、試以最近三年間之平均出口數觀之、幾佔全額百分之三十三弱、且有與日俱增之勢、查廿肅藥材產量最多、其最馳名者、為大黃·甘草·當歸·黃耆·等味倘能設廠就地製造、年可挽回漏巵不少蓋近年西藥入口、確為一嚴重問題、而大黃當歸等藥、西人嘗製為丸片、專銷吾國、更有急起直追之必要也、</p>
<p>（一）宜提佔植於蘭州水菸、馳名海內、已非一日、昔據徐佩璜氏面告、德人某君試騐蘭州菸葉之結果，製成雪茄、速在呂宋烟之上、則品質之優良可知、其在甘肅出口貿易史上、向佔重要之地位、年來因國人嗜好之變遷、與夫稅率負担之過重、已有逐年衰落之勢、查二十三年全國菸葉入口之數、據國際貿易局發表、計一千五百七十五萬金單位、其數實可驚人、倘能改良種子、推廣區域、不難使蘭州水菸恢復其已往歷史上之光榮、於出口貿易中、必能重現其活躍之地位、以上所述、實為挽回甘省入超根本之謀、似宜先定計劃、按步實施、數年之間、行見入超之數當不減而自減、然後國民經濟方有殷殷向榮之望、此在國人之如何努力而已、至目前治標辦法、本廳方在修訂消費稅率、其方針如下、（一）入口稅率擬加重、出口稅率擬减輕、（二）入口稅率中、外貨之稅率擬加重、國貨之稅率擬减輕、奢侈品稅率擬加重、必需品稅率擬减輕、以期補救於一時、蓋以如此年復一年、必使甘肅全部經濟陷於沒落、故不得不採此稅則自衛之政策也、（附甘肅最近三年間進出口貿易簡明表從略）</p>

<p>— （顯微生）</p>
<p>墨，誰都知道是黑色，古語也有「近墨者黑」的話兒，學校裏用的紅墨水，藍墨水，明明沒有半點黑氣，不知其墨在那裏？</p>
<p>浴堂裏用的毛巾，上下不分，堂倌一會兒給人家「揩脚揩屁股」，一會兒又給人家「揩手揩面孔」，正如吃酒人只等酒喝到嘴裏，好似蜜糖般的甜，你咄咄我咄咄咄之不休，毫不計及造酒人，當時赤着黑漆的足，爬在缸裏「踏蘗踏糟」，「脚矢」亦在其中，這大槪是抱着「眼不見為凈」的哲學吧！</p>
<p>刷牙齒的東西呌牙刷，以其能够刷去牙上的汚穢，板刷用來刷衣裳，照理應該稱他「衣刷」才對，，呌他板刷。難道「衣裳就是木板」麼？</p>
<h3 id="c174">醋 <a href="#c174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>— 闌刪</p>
<p>開門七件事，「醋」亦居其一。女人們有時思酸，用點醋來調製菜肴，或者買點酸梅酸菜吃白相，便是有孕的徵象，合家人等皆大歡喜，頑皮地開伊的玩笑了。</p>
<p>杭州館子的醋溜魚，膾炙人口，完全靠酷的排頭。</p>
<p>婦女平常時也多有喜歡吃醋的，其原因當然為了這酸溜溜的味兒，吃下去有一種微妙的感覺，可以刺激腸胃：——所以有胃病的人不宜吃酸辣品。——伊們不但吃醋，在某種時間，却也是製醋的能手，不必經過醋師的指導，也辦到甚為合格，那一股酸溜溜的。足使伊們的丈夫薰得通透。某某先生如果和某女士來往幾回，給他的夫人看見了，便大大的有氣，這麼一來，伊的製醋原料也有了；時常用着那些酸溜溜的言語去刺激他；就此他肯改過，也還算了；如其屢誡不悛，伊便推翻醋缸，和他大鬥法寶，結果伊的酸素作用，往往比較力子勝一籌，容易將他征服！</p>
<p>夫婦之間，固以甜蜜偽原則；但是一昧甜蜜下去，膩也膩煞了，到底有啥興頭？正如小菜，本以鷄鵝魚肉為貴，但久食則厭，總得改改花樣，換換口味。夫婦間亦然，有時發生一點酸事伴，調劑彼此的情感，刺激對方的口胃，這是無傷大體的；只要適可而止，切勿過量，否則刺激太深，會弄成不幸事故，翻不轉來，正如醋吃多了，一樣的要反胃</p>
<p>履園叢話有一段關於醋的趣事，說：「海豐張穆庵都轉，某日外出，有一老婦攔輿告狀，說伊的丈夫娶一側室，請求禁阻，張公笑着打發伊道：我是賣鹽官，不管人家吃醋事」。閱之可為噴飯。</p>

<p>永春婆婆喊我看封信。當我給伊唸著伊的兒子寄來的一封信的時候，伊的二隻廓落落的眼眶里有些水汪汪地。可是，我一點也不感動，我就記起了一個平凡的人來。</p>
<p>永春公公是個好靜而不好動的人，因此他的臉兒，鎭日地是鐵板板的。祇要是認識他的人，或是曾經見過他一面的，誰都會說他是副孤老相。</p>
<p>他是我們族里的族長，從來沒有聽見過有人稱呼他的小名的。尤其和我輩的那般小嘍囉們，却照例地不能不稱他公公的，而同時見了他正好像小鷄遇到了老鷹，使人戰慄。</p>
<p>他每日早上終是在一天亮就起了床，篤篤！篤！很有板眼地揑着那根吸得發了珠砂色的旱烟桿敲着樓板。睏在店堂裏的夥計們，聽到了他的催人起床的信號，於是都急忙地捲起了被蓋。</p>
<p>脫下了牌門，鎭上的人亦就漸漸地集攏來啦！人聲是嘈雜啦！中人張大了啞沙的喉嚨在嘶喊着貨物的斤量及市價，比交易所中的經紀人還要忙！永春公公却照例地是得上東界橫頭麻皮炳生的茶館裏去吃早茶的。他終是自己帶去一小包的雨前。他的茶誰都喝不上口，正是比藥還苦，可是他連得茶葉都要嚼進肚裏，等到市頭散了，他就和那巴盤龍的紫沙茶壺告了別。</p>
<p>我所以還能够記得起永春公公來，這完全他的苔蘇餅所給我的印象。</p>

<p>打圈子！」所有的狗全出來之後，他又這樣呼喝着；那些狗聽了，便齊在前面這一方空地上滴溜溜的奔跑起來，同時還不停的呌着，並把它們那一截鮮紅的狗舌，忽伸忽縮地吐弄着。有幾頭較大的狗，更就地翻起觔斗來，好像是一隊頑皮的小學生，在操塲上胡鬧。看去好不天眞可愛！接着，那太監又喝道：</p>
<p>「站住」！他的呼喝居然也和軍隊中的號令一般的有效。那些狗聽了，便立卽鎭靜下來，井然有序的排成了一列很整齊的橫行，恰好和太后身後所列的一行侍從人員形成對峙之勢，也許它們站得更比我們整齊些呢！它們的眸子都是很圓的凸出在眼眶以外，像兩枚圍棋上的黑子一樣；這時都一齊朝太后注視着，不稍瞬動地注視着；充分表顯出它們是一種受過訓練的馴畜的機智來。然而我們要是只粗粗的一看，却不容易見到它們的眸子，因為它們頭上的那一簇項毛都是特別的長，長得把眸子也掩過了，只有當陽光直射在它們的前額上時，才可以看見那兩顆像小電燈似的亮光，在黑暗裏閃動。至於它自己看起東西來，有無障礙，那我可不得而知了。</p>
<p>及至全體的狗都已排成直綫，而且都已站得穩定，並不再跳動了；就是它們的吠　也停止了，因為它們的呌也不是濫發的，所以那管理狗的太監可以要它們呌便呌，要它門不呌便不呌。（三一四）</p>

<p>— 枕綠</p>
<p>他曾經參加過幾次市政府發起的長途賽跑；有一次，跑二萬米，他在近百名的運動員中跑得第五名，受有當局的幾　獎品，和報紙上光榮的紀錄，—高志方三字很漏過臉在運動界，因為我不知這就是阿根的姓名，不曾注意。（他提出保存着的舊報紙幾張，和獎章為證。）這雖無補於他艱難的生計，反耗費了他不少掙錢的日子於預備練習，他自已很感滿意，</p>
<p>去年，他考進了上海市的警務訓練班，懇得姜懷素先生作保，照例就學六個月，在二百幾十人中以第八名畢業，便補進公女局的警察名額，被派在閘北太陽廟地段服務。他憑着良心，本其所學，盡他的職務，却遭了當地流氓的忌，加以不名譽的誣陷，幾乎撤差，要不是幾十家正式商家聯署公保他的人格，雖然那流氓終於受到法院幾個月拘役的處分。他經過這項風波，不敢怕讓惡勢力，和他們妥洽苟安，仍須「我行我素一，他自言其志。</p>
<p>至於他投身警界的動機，也可一說。原來有一天，他拉着空車就路旁歇下，正在慢條厮理的檢數進欵，抬頭瞥見一家大戶人家的墻門旁，一面舊的黨旗，遮掩着舊器具一堆。墻鬥口正有一人閒站着，像僕人的模樣。他瞧在眼裏，幾度自抑不平的意識，再也忍不住了，走前去問明那器物止是他家的，就告訴那人，這是</p>
<p>先總理締造艱難的黨徽，應加尊重，不可胡亂應用，請收了起去。那人先是待理不理，接着說他區區一個車夫，不配干涉，厲聲雜以叱駡。他見勸告無效，去邀了一個警察來，向他說明情由，請他相勸。那知那警察也責怪他多事，反而威嚇相加。他情願跟那警察到局裏去受罪，當然在同行的路上先受到零星的體罰。幸得局中職員賢明，斥資那警察了事。他平日本看不慣一部份警察的腐敢和虐待勞働階級的情形，這次更有激於中，所以發憤想入警界，預備以身作則：現在，他果得達到初步的目的</p>
<p>我看這高志方，智識雖還淺薄，却能奮鬥和趨向正軌，所以從他誠懇的要求：寫下一些文字，使他欣幸益圖勵進，並示一般困苦的靑年人。</p>

<p>在無錫車站附近的茶館裏，每天夜晚總有一大批人去吃夜茶。這些吃夜茶的客人都是從四等車裏出來的。他們多半是受了市塲的不景氣，離開了都市回他一無依據的老家，僂着身子，背着衣包，為了得着幾角錢的便宜，趁着人多到擠不開的夜四等，為着節省幾個住客棧的錢，拼着一夜不睡的精神去坐茶館，一壺十六枚的茶，三個銅板瓜子兒，一根辣味的旱烟桿，這便是他們的好消夜兒。他們正如夜總會裏的享樂哥兒一樣地把這黑夜想法排遣着。雖然一邊是感着夜的短促，時光不能多假片刻，一邊却咒詛着夜的無情的延續恨不得把東方的天空挖破，抓出那光明的太陽來。</p>
<p>夜是無情地延續着，誰是存心來吃夜茶的呢：於是吃夜茶的人打起呵欠來了，有的也不免和鄰近的攀談着。</p>
<p>「你是到上海去幫人家的吧？」</p>
<p>「是呵，薦頭行裏的人多到擠不開，等了好幾天，眞不是事兒，祗好拉回身了。一</p>
<p>他們望着鄉間的災荒把自已趕了出來，想到都市裏去謀生，可是這刻兒又被都市擠了出來，他們苦味地攀談着，再苦味地思索着，飲着苦味的茶。</p>
<p>吃夜茶的客人多半都是這麼着，雖然他們在巴望太陽出來，但是出了太陽他們依然是在黑暗當中。辣味的烟桿，苦一味的茶，呵欠是接二連三的打着。</p>

<p>— 稜鹿</p>
<p>考定梁山泊的地點，大槪是於讀水游很有帮助的，但想借此說明宋江何以會以梁山泊為根據地似乎非必要。我一向懷疑宋江等曾否固定地佔據過梁山泊，但我沒有考據的興趣，所據以懷疑幾項簡單理由，應是有目共見，不值發表。可是到現在迄未看到同具此意而更精關的見解，而却有人向相反的方面探索，那未我的意見，倒終於還值一說吧。</p>
<p>據各家相同的徵引，正史所紀載的宋江這一盜羣，是起於河朔而受招安於海州的。其中間則曾「橫行齊魏」，有「犯淮陽軍，」「寇京東」等事。這樣宋江等明明是一羣流寇，其流竄的路綫，很有些和前年劉黑七由河北竄回山東相彷彿。雖然宋江未必是以同樣短的時期，走上這樣長的路程，但宋江的流寇生涯，似也不過久。宋江何時起河朔，正史上沒有紀載，但宣和遺事記楊志，李進義等的赴太行山落草，是在宣和二年，這是三十六人中落草的最先一批，地點和正史的起河朔吻合，時間或也可信，那末卜距失敗，不過一年餘，恐沒有據山寨立基業的餘裕吧。</p>
<p>吳加亮等七人的落草是第二批，會合着楊志等十二人，當然也是到太行山。這裏出現了梁山泊之名，但這梁山泊傾就在太行山。太行山本有一部份稱梁山，而太行山多盜也是素有名的，這簡直無須如說山東梁山泊的素多盜藪尚須尋冷僻的蹬據。接着另十三人的入夥大槪也還在太行山，以後勢力大了，才流寇齊魏，呼延綽等與戰不勝，及投入夥，凑足三十六人，大槪是在中途了。</p>
<p>如果他們在流竄中曾有一時間比較固定，那大槪在淮河流域。元雜劇雙獻功裏所寫梁山的地勢是：「寨名水滸，泊號梁山；縱橫河港一千條，四下方圓八百里；東連大海，西接濟陽，南過詎野金鄉，北靠靑齊兗鄆。」這已把梁山泊遷至後來水滸傳所寫的附近，但顯然更南更東。縱然在這一帶不一定有可以安師梁山泊的地帶，作者旣寗把梁山泊來遷就他所知的故事，總可信梁山泊的地點安置，比較更具浮動性些。</p>
<p>把梁山泊固定到鄆州的是誰？這因大家並未發過如上的疑問，所以也未有人探求過，我也沒有試解答問題的能力與欲望。空洞地自然可推定是寫今本水滸的最初的底本的人。在宣和遺事與羅本水滸之間，似也容不下幾次改變，若竟是只一次，就非是施耐庵不可了。就水滸的內容看，寫這書的人該是個魯西人，不會是杭人的施耐庵。但宋江的故事，南方人似自有特殊的傳說，或者曾有杭人寫的並非後來水滸所祖的宋江一書也可能。兩者的關係，决不十分密切。杭州那時書業是相當發達的，也許後來初本的水滸流行，杭州也刻過，被書賈胡亂加七當地所識悉的作家的名字。以從筆記所載也傳此訛。（未完）沃圃</p>

<p>— 沃圃</p>
<p>四名家傳奇摘齣</p>
<p>淸人雜劇集，收車江英四名家傳奇摘齣四種，分譜韓，柳，歐，蘇四個大古文名家事，計：藍關雪，（韓）柳州烟，（柳）醉翁亭，（歐）遊赤壁，（蘇）都是以他們在日最流傳於世的行蹟來做書名的。</p>
<p>據我仔細覧讀後的所見，覺得這四種實是傳奇，並非雜劇。特就每一種傳奇中，選出若十齣，另行付刊的本子，與戲曲選本的性質彷彿。也許還是不曾寫完畢的傅奇，便先揀幾個斷片來發表了。（說詳下）所謂「摘齣」者，當即表示一摘出的幾齣」之意，甚為明顯。浚儀散人的序：「如徐文長四聲猿，尤展成西堂樂府之作，殊不可多得，」云云，雖然舉的例是雜劇：車作又是四種合在一起像四聲猿，寫韓，柳，歐，蘇，的故事，更和桃花源，讀離騷等的寫陶淵明，屈原一樣，都是著名文人，殊並不能就以之作為這「四名家傳奇摘齣」便是雜劇，及模擬徐，尤的證據。牠本質上之為傳奇，恐無可致疑。殺大的一層觀察點，便是內容各齣題材之不符，和罅漏，毫無貫串，處處關目零落不全，這是很確實的憑證。以下我們來逐一提出。</p>
<p>我們先看籃關雪，這一種的主題，應該是「雪擁藍關」，韓湘子九度文公的傳說，多少要破選用在內罷？但韓湘子在（一）「湘歸」齣內，回家見妻之後，就不見踪跡了。以次（二）「報忝」，寫韓愈忝淮西軍。（三）「賞雪」，寫雪夜破蔡州擒吳元濟。（四）「衡山」是愈登衡山。所謂「雲橫秦嶺」云云的一段故事，絲毫並未見有叙到。</p>
<p>第二種柳州烟，是很有意思的。作者大概仍然脫不了一香艷一的套子，替柳宗元跟劉夢得找出羅曼司來，都做了王叔文家僚壻。但故事仍然是殘碎不整的，我們找不出牠具體展開和打寫的眞象。（一）「春閨」王叔文二女五英，九英的出塲。「倡和」就接到柳，劉中第，接了絲鞭，到王家被二女試詩倡和去了。（三）風謠，是劉貶連州，聽聞柳在柳州之美政。（四）驛巹一，這是大結束，柳劉和王家二女終於團圓了。一八司馬一的事變，當是本劇前後離合的關扭處，其中空白，實在太多，情節無從推測。</p>
<p>醉翁亭一種，作者也替他幻想了一段凄美的幽艷的故事。（一）秋聲一，是隱括秋聲賦。（二）綣別十，寫永叔同他妻子的離別，原因為赴京求取功名，這一折完全是仿襲琵琶記「南沛」的。（三）「吊石」，永叔感念石曼卿之死。（四）「蓉館」，歐陽妻胥氏病歿，魂遊芙蓉仙館，但芙蓉城主石曼卿，照應朋友，設法敎她復活。（五）「返魂她醒來時，丈夫在外，已經「中了進士，點選詞林」，大概還沒有知道妻子患病呢？故事雖荒唐，却又一些首尾頭緒都沒有，醉翁亭事，也不曾提到。恐怕所摘以在傳奇中上半部居多。</p>
<p>最後一種遊赤壁，是唯一實寫了題材所示情節的，見（四）「赤壁」（二）「歸院一，則寫御賜金蓮事。其餘（一）「考壻」，（三）一送別」，（五）「後晤」，全寫的秦少游，蘇小妹楚女黃義姑（相當於文娟或邊朝華的人物）的事。像局山秀賺文娟中情節的一臠，不是正面寫東坡的了。</p>
<p>這所申引的僅是大略，內中各齣種種脈絡不接氣的地方，但又藕斷絲速，隨處皆可見到。俱可證明牠决不是四齣或五齣的一篇完整的自具起訖的雜劇，也不是每折目成一獨立的短劇，如荊石山氏紅樓夢散套那樣的體裁。而現存的一摘齣一中，寫主人翁的每反視其他陪襯人物為少，（如柳州烟中劉禹錫，遊赤壁中秦觀，篇幅較多，地位幾與柳，蘇同等重要。）這四種中的每一種，應該至少都有，三十齣以上，不然，大槪是不能够容納那許多支節冗長，複雜曲折的關目的。</p>
<p>車氏為什麼要刊印這部一鱗半爪的東西呢？這四種傳奇有無完全的本子？關於此點，我疑心實際他的傳奇全書，恐還未作成；僅僅才有了全部的綱領，和分齣的計畫，然後慢慢的正分齣逐步塡做起來。也許後面的反到先做了，並不按着順序，這是塡曲的通常經歷中所可能有的情形。本書書頁中縫作四名家塡詞摘齣」，這「塡詞一二字，似可玩味。結果，全書迄未殺靑，便因陋就簡，急於問世，「摘齣」二字，自掩其拙，也說不定？各齣未加「第一」「第二」字樣，一方面固也可作並非完整的雜劇格式的旁證；他方面則正或因傳奇中各齣，未悉完成，次序凌亂，尚不能釐定耳。旣標「摘齣」，原可不必諱言本來齣數的次第的。此外我想不出這選本式的，無聯繫的「摘齣一，有何另外刊行之需要。像這種體裁的戲曲集，更似乎缺少相同的例子</p>
<p>車氏據浚儀散人的序，是江右人。又作序年月為雍正乙卯。（一七三五）這乃僅知的關於他的時地生平一切。倘使上面的推論，有一半不合事實，四種傳奇，果皆已成書，他日幸獲發見的話，當能够再多知道一些的。</p>
<p>為淸人雜劇的編集體例着想，最好將來再版時，拿他抽出；或者作為一個附錄，覺得較為妥善一點。不知編印者以為何如？</p>

<p>— 何為</p>
<p>他輕聲地自語着，眼淚竟在他的眼眶里閃耀着了。可是他並不失望，只感到憤恨。舅父他們這時還沒有出來，一定是老太婆在那里從中作梗，不許娟子一塊兒出來。天籬似乎看見娟子在掙扎着，哀　着，伸辯着，要逃出那個老太婆的魔掌。可是那老女巫却把娟子監禁了起來，不讓她自由地移動一步。他想起老太婆那張脫了牙齒的嘴巴，那個皺紋縱橫的臉孔，那對獰惡兇險的眼睛，那雙乾　的，像僵屍似的手掌，全身驟然的感到一陣陰冷。那座白色的古屋，也像在頃刻之間變成陰森森的鬼窟。</p>
<p>他憤怒，發抖，只想着娟子如何能在這種環境底下生活下去，和如何才能拯救她脫離這種生活，不知不覺的已經走到嶺脚了。</p>
<p>就在這個時候他碰到了他的舅父。</p>
<p>「怎麼，舅父，你老是這樣不知天日的！我整整的等了你們一天，就連「上京』也該回來了，你怎麼……」</p>
<p>「不，不，你不要急！」手里提着一盞燈籠的舅父急忙阻止着。</p>
<p>「不要急？」</p>
<p>「是的，是的，急也無用呀！事情都是那個老太婆可惡，她一聽見我跟娟子低聲說話，就來阻止。而且像押解犯人似的，娟子走到東，她跟釗束，娟子走到西，她也跟到西，叫我有什麼法子呢？」</p>
<p>「那末我在凉亭里整整等了一天，娟子竟連知道也不知道嗎？」</p>
<p>「恐怕是的。」</p>
<p>舅父狼狽地回答着，偷偷地看着天籬那雙燃燒着烈火的，血紅的眼睛。天籬的臉色却鐵靑着，手脚也像怕冷似的顫抖着。</p>
<p>「這怎麼甘心…好，讓我親自找娟子去，看那老太婆怎樣對我…難道她吃了我不成？怕什麼？…舅父…你跟我來，燈籠讓我拿！」</p>
<p>「不，天籬，你怎麼好親自觸霉頭去？」</p>
<p>可憐軟弱的舅父低聲勸阻着，可是已下了决心的天籬，却一手奪過燈籠，頭也不回的朝着那座石頭房子奔去，剩下舅父愕然地立在黑黯的嶺脚，聽着春雨不斷地凄其地下着。（完）</p>

<p>拖着疲倦的腿，走上汽油船；呼的一聲，船遂即開了。浪花托着船身顫動着，在這邊岸上，飄流到那邊岸上，時間不過十五分鐘。</p>
<p>岸上的竹竿紥着華麗的綢綵，數十盞電燈果西地照耀着，黃昏裏更添了精神。</p>
<p>為了一些瑣事，要到××廳，心是更加寂寥了。</p>
<p>腿仍舊是疲倦着，於是呌車子。</p>
<p>—車子，××廳！</p>
<p>—三百錢。</p>
<p>—二百四。</p>
<p>肯定了交易，便把身子架在車上，隨着車子走到要走的路綫上，身子被移動着。</p>
<p>老年的車夫振起了精神，拖滑車，在破舊的城邊跑。</p>
<p>地是泥土堆滿着，小而尖的石子站在上面。車子便在這二種東西上移動，一頓一頓地幾乎使我訊起下江的×縣的鄉村上時常經過的轎子。</p>
<p>到了××廳，辦了我要辦的事走出來。腿是更疲倦了，不得不坐在車上。到××路去買些零星物件。</p>
<p>風是溫和地吹到肩上，我頓時從疲倦裏醒了起來，把眼向前一看，知道那車夫拖我到另一條路去。</p>
<p>矮小的平屋站在車子拖過去的二旁。菜油燈架在各偭屋子裏的木檯上，在不同的方向上，發出同樣微弱的光。等到車子移過了，沒有星光的黃昏的黑影又籠罩在前面。</p>
<p>—多難走啊。車夫叫着。</p>
<p>—誰叫你在這黑暗的地方拖？另一條路不是也可以走得麼？不過稍遠些。我說。</p>
<p>—唔。</p>
<p>於是我在衣袋裏摸出了電筒，揉一下，它的光照耀到車前五尺路遠。</p>
<p>—好啊。車夫冉叫着。</p>
<p>靠着電筒的不很明亮的光芒看過去，依稀地看到一所矮小的圍牆，圍牆前面，種下幾枝初發芽的柳樹，倒露出孩子們的氣息似的。</p>
<p>二分鐘後，車子移我到另一個方向去，黑漆的鐵鬥關着略整齊的屋子門牌。在電光下，頗淸楚地露出××巷十五號。</p>

<p>— 楊騷</p>
<p>莫非兄：</p>
<p>我現在又獃在市，和旦兄住在一起，暫時做一條大寄生蟲。今天由你寄旦兄的信中，曉得你還在記掛我的飯碗問題，一時覺得人與人之間的一種溫情氣味，便把久就想寫封信給你的欲望在此刻實現了。然而一提起筆寫，又不曉得要寫些什麼好；姑且說些空話罷。</p>
<p>一個人越老，除開是惡劣的環境使他眞的老朽而連思考都不願N於或不能了之外，對一切的現象——自然的，人間的——的認識，當然是越加深刻而正確化的。因此，許多起始不能互相珥解甚至互相反目吞噬的人，到了時過境遷竟會互相歡洽或在觀感完全一致之下擁抱起來的例子，古今來是很多很多的。一個人的感情，意志，意識，無疑地是由他的生理狀態及其更重要的處境如何所决定。記得從前在某報社的樓上和你爭論過意志自由與否的問題，當時你是個意志自由論者，而我是恰恰和你相反的。在這一兩年中間，不曉得你的這種見解是否已經改變？我是完全和從前一樣的，就是意志非自由論。而且這一兩年來的生活經騐，使我這種信心越加鞏固起來。我於信人與人之間的隔膜是極薄而容易扯破的，它因生理和處境的不同而產生。如果這種非天注定——宇宙間根本就沒有什麼天注定的現象——而大可移易或改造的膜刺破，兩個人有着比較相近的生活環境，因而有着比較相近的感情，理智，意識，兩人一定可以做朋友。難道你生來就喜歡吃米，而我是天注定我要吃麥來和你反對的嗎？難道旦兄自娘胎裏便帶來哈姆列特型，而何先生的高傲是上帝賜與的嗎？不，决不！你願意吃米是中國多產米和中國人吃米的傳統所養成；我本也吃米的，但胃病决定了我須吃麥。且兄的哈姆列特型，何先生的高傲，各有各的原因，即各由各人生活環境造成的：而且這由生活環境慢慢造成的性格，感情，願望，意志等等，也並不是凝固不可移易的它們將跟生活環境的變化而變化：就是因此，人與人之間的仇恨和誤解才不會是永遠的，人與人之間才有握手同道的可能；也因此，親家變成死對頭的現象也極其自然地常常會讓我們看到，使我們感傷</p>
<p>上面這些硬性粗淺的話，說來一定會使你哂笑，實無說它的必要；然而若想及為着要使你知道我現在因這個粗淺的認識更加確固而比從前樂觀許多了這點，我是應該不怕你笑我淺薄而說它的。你曉得嗎，我由這個感情，意志非自由論的更深的認識，對於種種無可奈何的分離减少許多傷感，對於目前不可撮合的種種隔膜增加無限希望：於是，我一身輕了；我感覺着不受到懷念和失望的壓迫，我的前途有光明！沿着正當的路走，在途中，我將有不少的伴侶；雖然有的命離開我或捨棄我，但新的將不斷地凑來。我將永遠不會孤獨，只要我不因厭惡而躱避目前的社會。對，這個的社會，它的形態，動向，和人的意志，感情一樣，也因組織它的各種機構的變動而變動，而且是在刻刻變動着的。我不可以樂觀地在這個息息移動着的社會當中生活，聽環境來决定我的行止；那麼，我何所苦而要懷戀，傷感，失望，頽喪？一切都非偶然；我能認識必然，跟着必然的路定，得了！</p>
<p>哩哩囉囉說一大堆廢話，也不自知這些廢話從何生出，想自必有其夾源，自己不覺得罷了。我推想，這些廢話，或許還會引起你非難我變成一個機械人；因為我似乎完全沒有意志了，為着我完全否認意志自由。可是，這裏豫先聲明一下，並不然。我並沒有也不能變成機械人。不錯，我完全否認意志的「自由」，但我不否認意志的「作用」。我是還有意志的：這或許可以告慰於在海外還要關心我的飯碗問題的朋友罷。</p>
<p>我來N市將近一月，一點事情沒有做，文章也沒有寫，眞有點着念了。飯碗當然懸在半空中，不會自己掉下來，除非我板鴉跳起舞來取它。但不管如何，我此後當會合理地努力生活下去，不會像從前那麼多煩惱，少笑容，多兒女情態，少丈夫氣，使朋友看了也不舒服。</p>
<p>望有工夫常常通信。嫂夫人均此致意。你們不是快養小孩了嗎？並祝你們未來的小寳　健康！</p>

<h3 id="c204">禁止中學男女同校 <a href="#c204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>— 行安</p>
<p>文化古城的北平，近來在禁止中学男女同校了。據二十五日平訊：平市立中學禁止男女同校已實行，現市府復頒令，禁止私立中學男女同校，現今夏起一律遵行，以繼風化云。</p>
<p>我國實行男女同校，已有好幾年的歷史了。現在平市當局，爲什麽忽然又要下令禁止起來呢！據平市府禁令所申，禁止中學男女同校，用意在「以維風化」。這樣看來，實行了好幾年中學男女同校的平市教育界，在過去，大概想是已經發現了若干有關風化的事件。故平市當局，爲防止這種事件的繼續發生，現時才又下令禁止起來。若果這測度是不錯，那末這回平市頒令禁止中學男女同校，其用心之苦，也頗值得讃嘆。不然的話，平市這種禁令，未免下得太奇突。這葫蘆里賣的，恐怕是另外一種東西了。</p>
<p>中學可不可以實行男女同校？這問題實在不須再去討論牠。這裹我們所要加以注意的，是：中學男女同校，是否會妨害風化？這一點。自來抱反對中學實行男女同校者，他們所持的理由，是說：青年在中學時代，年齡正達成熟時期，男女異性一接觸，常要發生自由戀愛的事情，故主張男女不應該同校。這理由實似是而非。須知男女同校是一回事，自由戀愛又是另一回事。難道禁止男女同校，青春男女自由戀愛的事情，就可以不發生嗎？退一步說，青年男女同校，自然免不了要發生自由戀愛。然這是男女青年神秘的時期，豈能勉強加以禁止嗎？若謂青年男女在中學時代，正宜奮勉努力，以追求知識。倘一旦走上自由戀愛之途，實有荒廢學業之虞。故中學男女，還是以分校爲善。這話倒也像說得很有理。可是我們要問，禁止男女同校，卽禁止不了青年的自由戀愛。那末一般實行分校的青年男女，也一樣自由戀愛起來，這會不會荒廢學業呢？</p>
<p>就是再退一步說，因為實行男女同校，青年才會發生自由戀愛。但青年男女發生自由戀愛，這是有礙風化的嗎？不是吧？若說青年男女間正當的自由戀愛，也是有害風化。那社會上像這種有礙風化的事情，真是多得很。當局就是要維持，亦會　到無從維持之慨了。</p>
<p>然而現在平市當局，卻在下令禁止中學男女同校了。我們真想不出，男女同校的中學，會有什麽風化可以維持的地方呢？</p>
<h3 id="c205">老同學 <a href="#c205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>— 華之</p>
<p>生活底疲憊，往往獨坐在燈下，望著繁星如點的天空，那樣地出神似的時間毫不吝惜地飛馳了過去。一個窗外飄著雨絲的晚上，天空是一片昏暗，玻璃窗上特塗了一層雨天特有的霧氣，平日我目光所馳騁的自由之鄉，如今是移轉到那個有裸體畫像的掛癢上，日子是加倍地飛快較我在記憶之中的。好像應該再起誓來珍惜我的前途，那樣願意看的時候，一陣溫雅的皮鞋聲從樓梯上響了起來，而且那聲音氏光對著我的房間。聽見一個陌生的聲音，像女子一般地斯文，問著我的名字，驀時間我仿佛是正等候著這位不速之客；開了門，燈光映</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>到那位來客面上的時候，我想小起一句有禮貌的話來應付他了。</p>
<p>來客有着修長的身材，配着一張淸癯的臉，在一堆蓬亂的頭髮底下，更顯出他的狼狽。因為我是背着燈光，所以來客略一遲疑，正如我的打量他一樣，然後過量的喜悅使他歡呼起來：</p>
<p>老朋友，不想我們有會面的時候</p>
<p>同時緊握着我的手。在我不知所措的時候，我被他胃着火燄的目光驚醒過來，他是我老同學徐君。</p>
<p>我從鄉下的縣中畢業，到上海進大學，是不慣於一切周遭的環境，常像一個書獃子似的把自己關閉在宿舍里。同宿舍的就是徐君。他是個現代夭學生，大學生的各種玩意兒，他都是來一手的。譬如跳舞，他懂得各種舞步，像紳士　一般地從草塲走過的時候，嘴里哨着各種流行的歌曲。對於運動呢，他又是校花們的目的物。我不能够詳細地描寫他，總之，他和我是隔離得太遠了；或許有時我們沒有會面的時候。我不知他是否鄙視我，然而我不能結合是鐵一般的事實。</p>
<p>那樣的一位摩登靑年，當我踏出校門，被現實生活鞭打着的時候，要不是他一雙我往昔不敢逼視的良光，在任何一種塲合里，我不會相信如今緊握着我的手的是當時的徐君。</p>
<p>我們坐定之從，他用他那雙銳利的目光打量我的臥室了。雖然我們現在並不是同宿舍時那樣地隔離，但是對於這所破陋的樓居，覺得太不像迎接一位久不相逢的貴同學了。他却說了：</p>
<p>境况很好啊！」</p>
<p>從烟罐中抽了一枝烟捲，他彷彿羨慕似的笑了起來。這更使我覺得慚愧，無論他是否在譏視我。我把寫字椅轉向了背燈光的一面，想着一些敷衍他的起首語，但是總是想起來，就是到了嘴邊的話。他燃了烟捲，走過來慢慢地拍着我的肩頭，表示一種美國式的親熱，同時用最狹小的步伐在室中徘徊起來。</p>
<p>這幾年來生活好啊？我終於向他發問。</p>
<p>他馬上站定了「好啊！」重覆了我的問句。</p>
<p>聽說你很得意啊！」他更笑得像隻老虎，「這次我從南京回來，在火車上遇見老王，他告訴我你最近很得意。」</p>
<p>瞧着他的誠意的態度，我不能懷疑他在譏視我了，但是我將以什麼話來使他滿意呢？</p>
<p>「老朋友，替我留意留意機會，他終於說出了我早已猜準了話。</p>
<p>我下意識地點着頭，望着老同學的一雙逼視的目光。</p>

<p>把這件事說得最起勁，而肯描寫招最淋漓的便是住在根福貼鄰的金大嫂，她，從「根福女人」（村上的人，從金大嫂的「建議」起，沒有一個人呌那個新來的女人做「根福娘子」的！）坐了一頂小紅轎子在半班（鈸上道士堂裏喊來的三個鼓手）「道子」的吹奏中進根福家門的時候起，就開始「捉」起那個女人的「班頭」來了—原因是有的：根福在上海做工，家裏留着一個老媽，她底伙食與「舖塲是全由金大嫂一個人在每月六元大洋的代價下包了去的：現在根福自己弄了女人，這筆生意當然是做不成功了：其次，據說是「新娘子」沒有規矩，見禮的時候連「金大媽」都沒有喚一聲。這樣，一過三朝，金大嫂就用了異樣的聲調在半聾了的根福媽的耳朶邊喊起來了：「你家的好媳婦植錢哩，油頭光臉的，值錢哩！哼，哼！」</p>
<p>而，到看到了根福女人連着三個晚上從後門溜出去的事情之後，第一個去對大家說的，當然不會是金大嫂以外的別人了。「哼！我老早就告訴你們的：油頭光臉的沒根沒攀的，是好傢伙咾？……每天夜裏總是搽得頭光面滑的出去；回來的時候那付樣子是……啊唷唷……你還沒有瞧見哩（其實，回來的時候究竟怎樣，連金大嫂自己都沒見過哩。）啊唷唷……嘔死人哩！這種貸，根福成月的在外面做工，她怎麼挨得住哦！往後笑話多着哩，你瞧着吧，你瞧…………」</p>
<p>其實，根福女人近來天天晚上瞞着人出去倒是有的，不過「沒根沒學」却並不見得：人家把這個女人「說」給根福的時候，也呌出媒人中人來寫過「紙頭」的：一漂漂亮亮的一個小寡婦，就在隔壁村子裏的，家裏一個人都沒有了。本來是不肯嫁人的了，男的死了下來，沒飯吃，才……」</p>
<p>而根福，自己的女人已經死了二年，家裏放者一個老娘也少人招呼；自家兒又是常日在十海做工的；弄一個家，一個月回來　二趟也好。這樣，趁手頭有點，便化了五十塊銀洋把那個「淸淸爽爽　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　了。</p>
<p>可是就在村子裏傳着「根福女人天天晚上要出去……呢！」的故事的當兒，根福也在上海聽到了同鄉人的傳說而秘密地帶了一種火一樣的殺氣回來了。第一個晚上就不聲不饗地蹲在金大嫂給安排好了的暗角裏偵察，到夜來這女人照舊出去的時候，便悄悄地在後面跟！</p>
<p>已經過隔村了，根福女人像懷着一種執切，一下子便在一處掩着的門裏走進去了。</p>
<p>門裏有着孩子的笑聲，女人的笑聲：「好孩子，好孩子，乖，媽媽要不是你，早就跟了你死了的爸……」</p>
<p>已經是不能忍耐的時候了，像發了狂一樣，根福衝進門，便把女人拖着出來：好，你底本頒大！一那麼着，拖到家裏的時候，已給打得半死了。「要不是為了這兒子，要不是……」女人能說的，就這麼一兩聲了。</p>
<p>半個月以後，根福不回來了，村裏的人也全知道了根福女人在前村有着一個兒子；可是，當一部份的女人開始原諒她的時候，根福女人已經在門前的樹枝上吊死了。</p>

<p>— 容</p>
<p>沒有結過婚的人，把結婚看作一朶鮮艷的花，那香氣是馥郁的，那姿態是招展的，幽雅得如曉霧中的玉蘭，熟情得如　夏時電藝　繞的玫瑰、芳醇得如倦倚在綠葉上的醉芙蓉，但是這稚氣的幻想也正如一朵鮮花，一經現實的鐵腕摧折，馬上就形容枯稿地乾萎了呢！</p>
<p>在我的積着歲月的灰塵的記憶裏，有那麼一個春天，是不會消滅了的，牠也許是一朶花，放過色香之後，就枯萎了，凋謝了，但那芳馥的氣息却永遠滯留在我的鼻觀，撫慰着我的全身，我不能忘記那個扇着薰風的四月天，那是個神話，是首悠悠揚揚的戀歌。</p>
<p>當天上堆着紫銅色的雲錦，地下妝遍了碧綠的靑蕪的時候，有兩個孩子，毫無拘束地從家裏跑了出來，從野地裏跑到水濱，在那裏歇下了，水濱是千朶萬朵的黃野花和猩紅的杜鵑花，布穀烏在田野間歌頌着豐饒的麥秀，僅隔一道淸淺的溪流，便可聽到漁人們用魚叉撥水和撤綱的聲音，落日中，靑山一抹紫，若極了在這環境中有兩個孩子傾吐着無邪的天眞　靈魂的幽秘：他們淸朗的笑聲和大自然凑成一個脈搏，那兩個孩子便是我和采靑。</p>
<p>「那麼，姨媽要把你嫁了，你怎麼樣？」</p>
<p>「那不要緊，我已經答應了她」。</p>
<p>「可是要養小孩子的，要被公婆打棍子的，懂嗎？」</p>
<p>聽到這話，她那麼一扭頭：「我不怕」</p>
<p>「我媽也想給我娶親，說我年紀太小，現在　　不到……。」</p>
<p>這兩個孩子娓娓不倦的談着，交換着關於己身的，關於未來幸福的種種談話、「未來」在我們面前就像是一幅極其絢爛的繪圖，一片光華的霞彩，希望漲飽了每個人的心，正如菓實和稻梁裝滿了倉廩。在幻夢中，一大段的日子溜走過去了，那峙她還十六歲，我也在讀着書，過一年他嫁了，她開始踏上無窮的人生跋涉的路子，如一個走遠路的旅客，連最後的身影都隱沒在黑暗之中。我此後沒有見到她，我在用疲乏和忍受來打發自己的歲月。這樣我過了許多年。</p>
<p>像春天的燕子，在今年我們又重逢了，她焦黃憔悴如一個中年的婦人，隨着她的是一羣累贅的孩子和一個瘦弱的丈夫，幾年之間，時光已經不留情地把她塑成另一個雕像，全是板滯的，散文的她給我的印象是黃昏，無人的廟宇，過了時的報紙，秋之寂寞的庭園。面對着這俗化了的驅殼，我驚詫於幾年來人事之驚端猛浪般的劇變，我不敢相信自己的眼睛。我又想到過去的夢，想到對於婚姻的詩意的憧憬，想到那錦繡的春野，想到廻旋在山涯水涘的布穀烏聲，想到小山花，最後這些東西很快地崩圯下去，而以一個漆黑的霧慢來掩覆了我幻想的一切……</p>
<p>我們把一個下午消磨在公圍裏，春天已經過去了，太揚焦炙得怕人，原野只泛着凄然的綠色，走過小橋的時候，一個　　　　　　　　　　　，落到我肩頭，落到我袖裏，最後我用手帕把牠拂到地上……</p>
<p>「那是凋謝了的花呢！」我沈靜地說。</p>
<p>她的臉色有點異樣了，她說：「這正好像是，一個人……」下半句沒說出。</p>
<p>我也沒有話，我只看了花一眼，花已經捲入漆黑的泥土。</p>
<h3 id="c209">家信 <a href="#c209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>— 天眞</p>
<p>誰說「家書抵萬金？」！在我却懷着一種恐怖的心情像對猛虎一樣地害怕觸及了它。然而那封面鮮明地綴着我的撫育者的爪痕，不工整的商人的手記與我是那樣地熟悉，親切，以及兩年的別緒着向我縈繞，誘惑，終於不自禁地顫着手折開來了。</p>
<p>也絲毫沒有植得我驚奇，神經彷彿給時代提鍊的驚奇事情馴服了，情感燒成了刦灰滲入在宇宙的微塵中，就是一座巍峨的石山坍到我的腦海，似乎也攪不起半絲波紋。頑石一樣麻木啦！我這末想。</p>
<p>然而不，我又很明白地知道：兩張八行書，是兩年中家事的速寫，寥寥發筆，是那麼深刻，那末逼眞，那末凄淸動人，可是覺得自己仍然有點麻木的原始性，不然，怎會連淚血也像珍惜地不肯瞪下一滴來？</p>
<p>不過，我又一點不模糊地記得：兩年前一個秋天的黃昏、我父親的一副令人淌着要作三日　的面影。</p>
<h2>Page 19</h2>
<p>是六年後的初識面，他用愕然的神情　着我，而我也占有「笑問客從何處來」之忱。各自機智地用靈魂接觸了番，他才吐出陌生氣開始問着：</p>
<p>「老了啦！沒打算我們父子還有見面的機會！」</p>
<p>他把眼睛一收，幾條虹彩斜掛在瞳子邊綠，隨着春露似的澤潤，浸及乾癟得發黑的眼眶的下唇。</p>
<p>一股薄荷味徐徐地展開在我的心幅，話的經路給淸淚壓塞了。兒子的老，是不容易在父親口裏落下來的呵，那帶有千萬斤的「老」字，使我身體各部分的毫毛也全倒栽下來，而腦細胞已超過全身的重量啦！</p>
<p>「你更蒼老啦！」我變成將受刀刑的那麼斛觫。</p>
<p>在六十餘年的征途中，前史是有過他的盛世豐年，坐交易所的時節，兩個門面營業的時節，操縱金融的時節，豐腴的體格就象徵了他順暢的世途，人們都慕羨着「財神」追隨他，戀念他，而他遇事也能顯出獨特的機警，果斷，並沒想料到，凄凉的暗影，會籠罩他的慕年！提到他的後史的創造，他彷彿無由地自己來悲哀，由於這，我更悚於自己的罪愆無贖回之一日了。兒子，他也和普通人一樣有着絕大的幻想，為了這幻想，他曾經用着希有的情熱噓撫我，灌漑我，直到現在自己淪落到世入熟眼外，還保着原先一股傻勁兒。站在他面前的我，還能有昂揚的資格嗎？</p>
<p>話彷彿從交襲的視綫上全問答告終了：我一副尷尬樣見，他一幅憂喜交織的枯葉似的臉子。</p>
<p>晚上，他便住在我八塊大洋一月的亭子間裏，而且是同睡在一張床上。</p>
<p>照例，在寂靜的對坐上就是朋友也應寒暄幾句，可是正因為是朋友才有寒暄的心境，現時壓在彼此心境上是一綹理不出頭緒的悲酸絲，誰也不需求說出什麼，如同面前撤下了一層禁網似的；就那麼默默地等待着睡魔來吞沒各人的敏感和靈機。</p>
<p>然而睡魔偏不是我們想像的那樣仁慈，—一張單人被子，突然變得龐大起來，我伸手一摸，父親的脚露在外面，立刻明白父親仍是從前的心理：怕我着凉讓我多蓋一點兒；我和他蓋上脚，他彷彿怪不舒服似的。一會，他輕輕地像怕驚擾我似地翻了個身，手由我的脚踝摸到上腿，放開手，發出從前在家時聽慣了他的心痛的一聲嘆息，嘴裏似乎還有則則聲。</p>
<p>「爸爸，床窄了，睡得不適意嗎？」我什麼問。</p>
<p>「不是啊！我摸你大腿上只賸下幾根骨頭！買點參吃啦！」</p>
<p>我心酸一陣後，準備說：飯都沒有吃，還吃參！但我怕刺痛他的心，終究不敢說出屠。欺騙雖是不可恕的罪過，可是把眞情刺激他的然痛，也同樣是一種殘忍。末了我只好是，是，是地來虛了他的心願。</p>
<p>現在我讀了他的信，銀色的鬚髮和枯葉子臉，又浮上了腦幕，我恨不得把它和我的心，一同扯得粉碎。</p>

<h3 id="c222">本年美國造車數量預計 <a href="#c222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>— 虞</p>
<p>廠方目標為三百五十萬輛　明年新車提早十一月登塲</p>
<p>美國汽車製造家近方回顧本年第一季之全國產車量。計各廠所造之汽車數達一·〇〇〇·〇〇〇輛。至本年第三季止。今年開首之六個月中。美國汽車產額至少可達二·〇〇〇·〇〇〇輛。汽車製造商之全年產量目標為三·五〇〇·〇〇〇輛。或且過之。數量方面。第二季應較第一季為增多。至其餘時日則續照羅斯福總統之計劃。所有一九三六年之新車。將提早登塲約兩個月對於全年產額之增加殊有關係。此項計劃。其原意在令工人辦續於十二個月中獲得多量之工作。將令新車上塲之期。由一月一日提早至十一月一日。各公司主腦人亦多主張將汽車展覽會提前至十一月初舉行。紐約汽車展覽亦擬由各公司主持。以替代一九三五年時之各銷售代理人所發起者。</p>
<p>汽車業是否能達目標中之五·五〇〇·〇〇〇輛之數。乃在不定之間。而以避免重要之稽遲實為至要。車身與零伴製造目前未捲入罷工漩渦之中。其他各部則常受罷工之威脅。因工人方面之鼓動關係。阿克龍廠之車胎部亦有停工之虞。最近所得之報告稱。卽將屆期之八日制工作。有延期之傾向。在此時期中固特異·發施登·固德立各廠均舉行選舉。</p>
<p>本年開首之三個月。數逾一·〇〇〇·〇〇〇輛之汽車產量中。克雷斯勒之五種出品。潑萊茅斯·第沙多·道琪·克雷斯勒·及發谷。其客貨車兩項共達二四九·〇六四輛之多。實為該廠前此所未有之盛况。在此一季之時期中潑萊茅斯共運出一三六·〇四〇輛。地特律及樂士安極立斯兩處之工廠。每日造車約二·〇〇〇輛之譜。</p>

<h3 id="c225">蓄電池的經濟用法 <a href="#c225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>— 仁</p>
<p>蓄電池在汽車事業上。應用之重要。已是毫無疑義。大家都承認的。但是如何能使用一個蓄電池。可以歷久而不致損壞。這是從經濟着眼上的一個絕大問題。下面所述各點。如能加以注意。這經濟使用的問題。便不難迎刃而解。</p>
<p>（一）充電必須依照規定速率普通鉛蓄電池的標準規定時間是八小時。能依照這規定時間充電。蓄電池的使用效率及有效壽命。必可得到良好的成績。此外較速較慢。均非所宜。而尤以較速為害最烈。因時間短促。欲仍達一定量的蓄電量（安培小時）。則電流的安培數量非增大不可。於是所放出的氣泡。旣快又多。溫度升高。使有效質料來不及附着於鉛片上。忽忙中遺漏至電池的底部。造成短路。危險之大。不難想見。</p>
<p>（二）電解質比重的限制無論充電或放電的程度如何。都可以拿比重器來測量。充電時電解質的比重在一·二〇〇至一·三〇〇之間。放電時電解質的比重不得過一·一七〇。</p>
<p>（三）不可過量充電蓄電池於規定充電速率之下。他的充電程度滿足與否。可用下列三個方法來判定。</p>
<p>第一。蓄電池的電壓於一小時內。並無增加。</p>
<p>第二。蓄電池的二極間。有巨量的氣泡發生。有如沸騰。</p>
<p>第三。電解質的比重。於一小時之內。保守不變。無增無减。</p>
<p>（四）不可過量放電過量放電可使硫酸鉛析出的數量驟增。惟因硫酸鉛為不良導體。故內阻以增。電壓以减。循至硫酸亦突起硬化。而促成蓄電池內主要物件的崩壞脫落。所以過量放電的弊病必須加意戒免。普通蓄電池於規定放電速率之下。當電壓降至一·七五〇伏脫時。即宜停止放電。（接第十版）</p>

<p>(Qingdao) At the Zichuan Coal Mine, Tenth Coal Seam, Second Pit, owned by the Lu Da Company, at 11:30 AM on the 13th, a huge sound suddenly occurred, and the entire area collapsed. Over four hundred coal miners, along with one Chinese and one Japanese technician, were tragically drowned. Simultaneously, the eighth coal seam was affected, and over two hundred coal miners were also suffocated. The mine authorities are currently carrying out rescue efforts. This mine is the largest in Shandong, jointly operated by China and Japan. This incident has caused significant losses, and coal production will be greatly affected. (14th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Jinan) At 11:25 AM on the 13th, a major flood occurred at the No. 75 coal mining area of the Second Pit of the Zichuan Lu Da Company Coal Mine. The water surged rapidly, and transportation was cut off. After about forty minutes, the bottom of the pit was filled with water, and the water pumps could not operate. Approximately four hundred workers were trapped inside, along with Japanese technician Zoso Arahara and surveyor Rongfang Yuan. They could not be rescued by evening. The pit tunnels were not ventilated and filled with carbon dioxide. Over two hundred workers in the No. 19 mining area were also not rescued. A suicide squad was assembled to go down the mine, but due to the excessive gas, they could not approach. The Second Pit has already been flooded, with the water rising one meter per hour. By 3:00 AM today, it was only eighteen meters from the mine entrance. The water is surging even more rapidly, and the First Pit is also in extreme danger. It is confirmed that over six hundred workers have drowned. Family members are wailing around the well, their cries reaching the heavens. Efforts are currently being made to recover the bodies of the workers, which is estimated to take about a week. This is truly an unprecedented tragedy. (14th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Jinan) There were originally over seven hundred workers in the Zichuan Lu Da Company coal pit. Over one hundred escaped after the flooding, and approximately five hundred drowned inside. The county magistrate, the police chief, and the resident army brigade commander Chunxiao Ning have all gone to maintain order and provide rescue. Because the original water pumps have been submerged in the water inside the pit, it is necessary to purchase more from outside to drain the water. The water is surging from the interior of the pit, so the workers at the bottom of the pit could not escape. The families of the workers have returned home tonight. (14th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Qingdao) Yesterday morning at 11:00 AM, the tenth pit, the lowest level of the Zichuan Coal Mine of the Lu Da Company, which is jointly operated by China and Japan and has a total extension of fifteen miles, suddenly flooded. Within forty-five minutes, the pit was full of water. Over four hundred laborers working there are missing. Currently, the water is increasing in the pit at a rate of one meter per hour, making it impossible to supply air to the eighth pit, which is two hundred meters above. The lives of one hundred miners are in great danger. A suicide squad of twenty Japanese is working hard to carry out rescue operations. Furthermore, the eighth and tenth pits are the lifelines of the Zichuan Coal Mine. If they become abandoned pits, it will greatly affect the Lu Da Company. Therefore, the situation is extremely concerning. (14th Telegraphic Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Qingdao) The Qingdao Zichuan Coal Mine suddenly collapsed at 11:30 AM on the 13th. The mine shaft was completely filled with water in less than an hour. At that time, four hundred Chinese workers and one Japanese technician and one Chinese technician working in the mine shaft were all submerged. The company authorities are doing their best to rescue them, but because the water pumps cannot be used, they have given up hope. (14th Japanese Allied Press Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e4">Chairman Chiang's Address at the Yunnan Welcome Meeting; Hopes that All People of Yunnan Will Shoulder the Responsibility of Revitalizing the Nation; Develop Abundant Resources and Build an Industrialized Yunnan; Chiang Encourages the People of Yunnan at the Expanded Commemoration Week Meeting <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>Kunming Chairman Chiang's address at the Yunnan Provincial Party Headquarters and the welcome meeting of the people of all sectors, titled "Hoping that All People of Yunnan Will Shoulder the Responsibility of Revitalizing the Nation," reads in full: "Members of the Provincial Party Headquarters, representatives of all sectors of Yunnan, and fellow compatriots, this brother has come to Yunnan, and I am very grateful for the enthusiastic welcome from all sectors. I am truly ashamed of my lack of talent and virtue. However, I am confident in one thing after arriving in Yunnan, which I can also tell the fellow compatriots in all sectors of Yunnan, that is, I have brought the spirit of the central government to Yunnan and united it with the spirit of the party, government, and military circles and all comrades in Yunnan, as well as with the spirit of all fellow compatriots in Yunnan. Moreover, I will definitely be able to bring the spirit of all the people of Yunnan back to the central government, so that the spirit of all the people of Yunnan and the spirit of the central government can be thoroughly united to jointly shoulder the responsibility of the National Revolution. I am confident that I can definitely do this. Although we may not see much benefit in the present, it will definitely produce the greatest good results in the near future. Just in this respect, it is very beneficial to the country and the revolution. Therefore, although this is my first time in Yunnan, I would like to come here every year to meet with our fellow compatriots from all walks of life in Yunnan. Secondly, I would like to make a contribution to the fellow compatriots in all sectors of Yunnan during this trip, which is to hope that all of us in Yunnan will rise up to build a truly industrialized Yunnan, as the most important foundation for revitalizing the nation. Now, foreigners say that our country is an agricultural country. Originally, China has been based on agriculture since ancient times, and we ourselves also recognize ourselves as an agricultural country. There is nothing wrong with being an agricultural country, and we are still going to revitalize agriculture to stabilize the foundation of the national economy and seek the revitalization of the nation. However, everyone must understand that when foreigners say that China is an agricultural country, what they mean by agricultural country is that they recognize that we are all backward and should be slaves to their industrial countries and not be worthy of talking about equality with them. This statement of theirs, on the one hand, contains national prejudice, but on the other hand, in fact, if a country does not have a considerable industrial base, it is very difficult to keep pace with other countries. Therefore, developing abundant resources and revitalizing industry are of course urgent measures for us to save ourselves from danger and revitalize the nation. During this trip to Yunnan, I have an important observation, that is, in view of Yunnan's abundant resources, fertile land, mild climate, and industriousness of the people, Yunnan is truly the best province for developing industry. We will not talk about industrial construction if we don't talk about it, but if we want to talk about industrial construction, we must first start with Yunnan. We must create a solid and grand industrial foundation in Yunnan in order to revitalize our nation. Therefore, I hope that all fellow compatriots in Yunnan will know that the people of Yunnan have such a great responsibility and a special status for the country and the nation. Everyone should rise up together and work together to build an industrialized Yunnan and shoulder the responsibility of revitalizing the nation. Furthermore, although my trip to Yunnan is very short, I have heard and seen many things, especially the simplicity and kindness of the customs and habits of the people of Yunnan. I feel that no other province can compare. It can be said that now, if we want to see the inherent spirit, morality, and atmosphere of the Chinese nation, we can only see it in Yunnan. Therefore, after this trip to Yunnan, my ambition to revitalize the nation has become even more firm, and I have truly increased my infinite hope. I hope that all fellow compatriots in Yunnan will know where the inherent spirit and morality of our nation lie, and strive to develop our spirit and improve our morality, respect ourselves, love ourselves, strengthen ourselves, and be self-reliant. In this way, our nation will definitely be able to revitalize itself. In short, in today's warm welcome, on the one hand, I am ashamed and dare not accept it, and at the same time, I truly have unparalleled joy, infinite feelings, and infinite hope. The most important point is that I sincerely hope that the leaders of all sectors, the elders, the fellow compatriots of all sectors, and all comrades in the party, government, and military circles, including Chairman Long, will unite their spirits, concentrate their strength, and work together. In this way, we believe that within three years, we will definitely be able to build an industrialized Yunnan and make it the most important foundation for revitalizing the nation. This is my hope and contribution to the fellow compatriots in all sectors of Yunnan. I am very grateful for everyone's hospitality tonight, and I have nothing to repay, so I wish you all good health.

<p>Kunming At 9:00 AM on the 13th, the Provincial Party Headquarters held an expanded Commemoration Week for the late Dr. Sun Yat-sen. Chairman Chiang, accompanied by Zhuhui Wu, Bulei Chen, Daogang Yan, and others, attended the meeting, which was solemn and enthusiastic, unprecedented. Chairman Chiang said in his speech that he had already spoken to the leaders of all sectors yesterday about the special responsibility and very important position that the people of Yunnan have for our country and nation, and that we should work together to build a new Yunnan and lay the foundation for the revitalization of the nation. In terms of geography, he especially hoped that everyone would work hard to build an industrialized Yunnan as the foundation for building an industrialized new China. Secondly, everyone is very clear about the spirit and content of the New Life Movement and has been working hard to implement it. He hoped that they would continue to work tirelessly and fundamentally save the country. (14th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

They were intercepted by the Zhejiang army halfway. The bandits were caught off guard and unable to resist. They risked crossing the mountains and fled in disarray. The Zhejiang army is now pursuing them in victory and has telegraphed Fujian to strictly block them, vowing to eradicate them. A unit of bandits from the puppet Fujian-Jiangxi Military Region scattered and fled to Tanwei, Dehua County, where they were attacked by the stationed troops, who killed thirty and captured twenty. The rest fled to Shantou Mountain, where they are still being pursued. (14th Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e14">British Empire Diplomatic Discussions and the Far Eastern Question <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>— Star</p>
<p>Recently, the Prime Ministers of the British Empire's self-governing dominions gathered in London on the occasion of the 25th anniversary of the ascension of the British monarch. They discussed the future diplomatic strategies of the Empire. According to Reuters, the discussions were of great significance, and the representatives of the self-governing dominions and the British cabinet had reached a consensus. Concrete decisions were also made on the defense of the Empire. These talks have a profound impact on the future of the Far East. Although we cannot know the exact conclusions, based on the usual statements of the leaders of the British Empire's dominions, the recent trends in the foreign policies of the self-governing dominions, and the current changes in the Pacific situation, the outcome of these talks is not difficult to surmise.</p>
<p>Those unfamiliar with the inner workings of the British Empire often confuse the British Empire with the London government. In reality, the traditional policies and current needs of the London government often do not align with the traditional policies and current needs of the various dominions. After the Great War, the dominions sent troops to Europe to assist the London government, so the London government gradually considered the wishes of the dominions and respected their opinions in foreign and defense matters. At the Paris Peace Conference, the dominions had representatives. In the League of Nations, the delegations of the dominions held equal status with the British delegation. At the 1921 Imperial Conference, when discussing the abolition or continuation of the Anglo-Japanese Alliance, Canadian Prime Minister Meighen single-handedly overturned the pro-Japanese and anti-American policy decided by the London government. He proposed that the United States, Great Britain, China, and Japan hold a joint conference to resolve the Far Eastern disputes. At the time, even conservatives like Foreign Secretary Curzon changed their plans to safeguard the overall interests of the Empire and accepted his proposal. Therefore, the Imperial Conference of June 1921 was actually a precursor to the Washington Conference. Without the efforts of the Canadian representative, relations between Great Britain and the United States would have deteriorated, and the Anglo-Japanese Alliance, the Nine-Power Treaty, and the Four-Power Treaty would not have been produced. The ten years of uneasy peace in the Pacific would not have been possible. At that time, if the London government's opinion had prevailed, the United States would have refused the League of Nations and humiliated Great Britain, and international credibility would have been lost. Cooperation would have been impossible. Japan, having allied with Great Britain since 1902, had been a powerful ally in the Far East for ten years, and there was a need to continue the alliance. However, Great Britain's willingness to cooperate with the United States at the Washington Conference was due to the success of the foreign policies of the dominions and the London government's acceptance of their opinions.</p>
<p>The reasons why the London government was pro-Japanese and the dominion governments were pro-American have their own geographical and historical causes and are not accidental. Great Britain's traditional foreign policy has been to maintain the security of the English Channel. Therefore, it is willing to pursue anything that is beneficial to maintaining the balance of power on the continent and its maritime hegemony. Its willingness to connect with Japan was to alleviate its concerns in the east, allowing it to cope with the European continent with more ease. Furthermore, Great Britain also needed Japan's assistance against Russia and Germany. However, the politicians of the dominions thought differently. They had little interest in European issues and did not consider the safety of the English Channel to be of immediate concern to them. What worried them was the declining strength of the British Navy. Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and South Africa are thousands of miles away from London. The British Navy and Air Force are insufficient to guarantee their security. This is one reason. After the Great War, Japan rose in the Far East. Its naval power could move south and threaten Australia and New Zealand, and eastwards, it could endanger Canada. Moreover, its economic aggression was very fierce. South Africa, Australia, Canada, and other places successively rejected Japanese goods, deeply worried that Japan would rebel and treat the British Empire's dominions as it treated China. This is the second reason. On the contrary, the relationship between the United States and the British dominions is very close. Canada is the most powerful dominion, but its population is only one-tenth of the United States. Most of its domestic resources are exploited by American capital. The American Navy is equal to the British Navy, and Canada and the United States have a common interest. The naval power of the United States also extends to South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand. Therefore, how to establish friendly relations with the United States and use the maritime advantage of the United States to alleviate the weakness of the British Navy is the third thing that the dominion authorities are concerned about.</p>
<p>In summary, the attitude of the British dominions is to seek cooperation between Great Britain and the United States to prevent Japanese aggression and to replace military diplomacy and alliance diplomacy with joint diplomacy and collective peace. Specifically, in Europe, the dominions only hope that the League of Nations will be a moral cooperative organization and will not use force. In the Pacific, they hope that the Washington Treaty system will continue to be maintained so that the United States and Japan will not clash, that Great Britain and the United States will reconcile, that the security of the territories of all countries will be guaranteed, and that the defense burden in the Pacific will be reduced and armaments will be reduced to reduce the chances of war. Once war breaks out, the existence of the various dominions will suffer a fatal blow. Now that the British government and the dominion governments have the same attitude, it is inevitable that Great Britain's actions in the Far East will be based on Anglo-American cooperation and will be aimed at maintaining the peace system under the Washington Treaty. Thirteen years ago, there was a diplomatic victory for the dominions, and then the Washington Conference was convened. The impact of this British Empire diplomatic discussion on Far Eastern relations is self-evident.</p>
<h3 id="e15">U.S. Treasury Secretary's Speech: No Change in Silver Policy; Stabilizing Currency Should Not Be the Sole Responsibility of the United States; Prefer to Use Hard Currency to Pay Trade Deficits <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>(Washington) In his radio address tonight, Treasury Secretary Morgenthau did not indicate any change in the U.S. silver policy. Although Morgenthau did not make any specific announcement regarding the silver purchase plan, he did say that the United States "will strive to make silver more useful in the monetary system because silver is used as currency by a large part of the world's population." Most of the Treasury Secretary's speech discussed the possibility of international currency stability. On this point, he stated that the United States is not unwilling to cooperate in stabilizing international exchange rates, but it is very unwilling to make unnecessary sacrifices that would cause the United States to suffer great losses in the world market. In short, "The world should know that if all countries are prepared to stabilize their foreign exchange rates, the United States will not obstruct it. We have been in the position of onlookers. We did not initiate any currency wars, but the losses we have suffered are immeasurable. Therefore, others should not blame us for having to bear the responsibility of restoring order. All of our current actions must be based on the certainty that we will no longer lose the benefits we have already recovered. We are not unwilling to stabilize currencies, but if countries still cannot maintain order, we can avoid being harmed. We have already revalued our currency, and we can change it again in the future. There is no restriction," he said.</p>
<p>However, Morgenthau also strongly asserted that the current U.S. dollar is very stable because "the government's monetary policy has allowed us to escape from chaos and continue to move forward towards recovery." Morgenthau also said that if the United States wants to fix the dollar or devalue it again, it is free to do so. However, the United States is only concerned with protecting normal foreign trade and does not want to dominate the entire world market. Therefore, "We not only do not want to compete in devaluation, but our currency is very stable. If we continue on this path, the countries of the world may eventually achieve practical stability. It is not impossible." However, the so-called stability does not mean that the United States will declare that it will no longer change the gold content of the dollar. If it does, it will only trigger a new round of devaluation competition in other countries. Morgenthau continued that the United States will certainly do its best to restore world prosperity, but it is also unwilling to allow countries that manipulate currencies to harm the United States for their own benefit. "If we plan our future foreign trade, we must first decide whether we are willing to sell goods to customers who cannot pay for them. Of course, we can collect more IOUs, and there are many international bankers who are willing to handle such procedures. But at present, what we are collecting is a large amount of gold and silver in cash. In addition to paying for trade deficits, this cash is also used by other countries to escape to the United States to seek refuge under our stable currency. Economists have said that if we collect all the cash in the world, there will be no more international trade in the future. But in fact, although our gold reserves have reached a previous record, the world's gold production is also increasing rapidly. Some people oppose our gold and silver policy, calling it a cause of the large amounts of gold and silver in the world not being able to circulate. However, our monetary reserves have also been enriched as a result. Debts that are not paid on time cannot be used as a reserve for our currency. Therefore, these debts can also be called a congestion of currency. If we do not want to choose one of the two, the government is willing to choose to use gold and silver to pay for international differences," the Treasury Secretary said. The Treasury Secretary also criticized the policies of former President Hoover, saying that from July 1914 to the end of 1932, the United States had exported a huge amount of goods worth $47 billion, and that $19 billion of these goods had not been repaid. (National Telegram, 13th)</p>
<p>(New York) According to Wall Street observers, Treasury Secretary Morgenthau's speech on the dollar today was issued by the U.S. government to probe whether European countries have any intention of stabilizing exchange rates. The financial community was generally disappointed with the Treasury Secretary's speech. The Treasury Secretary not only failed to clarify the government's attitude towards silver, but also failed to clearly describe the national currency issue. Some financial experts believe that the Treasury Secretary's failure to set a new price for silver is very disappointing. Some people also said that setting a new price for silver is a matter for the President. Also, most economists do not believe that the United States can obtain large amounts of gold and silver from foreign countries under the current policy. It is believed that the continuous inflow of this hard currency into the United States is enough to cause financial turmoil in other countries, especially in China, Mexico, Peru, and other countries. At the same time, these hard currencies in the United States will also become unproductive. However, businessmen generally expressed joy that the government intends to cooperate with other countries to stabilize exchange rates because if the exchange rates of the dollar and other currencies can be stabilized, it can restore mutual trust in the international market. It is still difficult to judge what impact the Treasury Secretary's speech will have on the market. Silver speculators are generally disappointed with it. At the same time, after the dollar stabilizes, the price of gold will not rise again, so gold buyers are also mostly waiting and watching. (National Telegram, 14th)</p>
<p>(Washington) In Treasury Secretary Morgenthau's speech, the U.S. financial community recognized the honest nature of the statement that the United States is unwilling to unilaterally fix the price of the dollar, but also does not want to hinder the process of international currency stability, which was unexpected. Some observers believe that this statement is intended to put the issue of currency stability before Great Britain, because the so-called section that the United States cannot proceed alone in the aspect of stability is tantamount to inviting the United States to cooperate in the process. It is said that before making his speech, Mr. Morgenthau carefully considered the remarks he intended to make with President Roosevelt. Therefore, Mr. Morgenthau is believed to be speaking as the representative of the full authority of the government. Senator Wheeler criticized the government's new measures and those who advocated immediate stability and are now criticizing the Treasury Secretary's remarks. In other words, President Roosevelt has obviously changed his position. President Roosevelt had previously stated that he would not consider stability unless the price level of 1926 was reached. In January of this year, President Roosevelt's remarks in Congress still stated that the average price level at that time was only 74.8 percent of the 1926 level. Now that the Treasury Secretary has made this statement, it can be seen that the positions are inconsistent before and after. (Reuters Telegram, 3rd)</p>
<p>Basel The Bank for International Settlements today issued an annual report attacking the U.S. silver policy, stating briefly that this policy has caused silver-using countries to suffer damage and has destabilized international exchange rates. The report continued that if the international need for silver were as great as that for gold, it would not be necessary to resort to artificial actions. At the same time, there is no indication that this action by the United States will fundamentally change the international status of silver. (National Telegram, 14th)</p>

<p>(Rome) The government today issued an order strictly prohibiting the export of silver, regardless of silver blocks, silver bars, or silver dollars. Travelers are only allowed to carry 50 lire of silver coins when leaving the country. The effect of this order by the government is to prevent the country's silver from being transported abroad due to the rise in silver prices abroad. People had expected the government to take this action beforehand. (National Telegram, 14th)</p>
<p>(Rome) Italy today officially banned the export of silver. It is reported that Italy needs a large amount of cash silver in order to transport it to its colonies in North Africa. Therefore, this ban was issued. (Reuters Telegram, 14th)</p>

<p>Brussels, Belgium Prime Minister Zeeland made a speech at a banquet for foreign journalists. This was the first speech after the new cabinet issued its political declaration. Zeeland briefly stated that the government is determined to reform domestic affairs, and the success or failure can be seen at the end of this year. So far, the government has achieved some results: (1) Japanese capital has flowed back into Belgium in large amounts, indicating the success of Belgium's monetary policy. (2) The position of banks has been greatly consolidated. (3) The government does not support but restricts the increase in interest rates. (4) The prices of various securities have continued to increase within a moderate limit. (5) After the surge in prices, they have now returned to stability. In addition, Zeeland also said that devaluing the currency was not only to rescue the banks, but also to prevent the banks from stopping payment of debts, so it was necessary. Other countries devalue their currencies to obtain commercial benefits, but Belgium is not one of them. As for the government's policy outline in the second stage, there are the following two points: to enable industries to absorb unemployed workers, and to reduce the financial and tax burden by reducing interest rates.

<p>(London) Today in the House of Commons, Conservative MP Crooke-Lawton asked the government to pay attention to the amendment of the Chinese Trademark Law and advocated negotiating with the Chinese government to provide better protection for British trademarks. Lord Privy Seal Eden replied that the revised text of the Chinese Trademark Law is obviously better than the original and that the current difficulties can be overcome. Conservative MP Mauren asked the government to pay attention to the unpaid Shanghai-Fengjing section of the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway line loan. Eden replied that negotiations have been conducted many times without result. British Ambassador to China, Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen, is now working hard on this matter. Mauren also inquired about the detention of British national Parsons in Gansu Province. Eden replied that the officials accused Parsons of stealing antiquities from caves, so he was detained. The British Embassy in Peiping has negotiated with the Chinese government, and the Chinese Foreign Minister has agreed to send a telegram to the Gansu Provincial Governor to send Parsons to Peiping and provide protection along the way. Eden traveled to various European capitals last month due to diplomatic issues and was very tired, resulting in illness for a long time after returning to England. Today he attended the House of Commons, so when he stood up to answer the MPs' questions, everyone applauded to welcome him. (Reuters Telegram, 13th)</p>
<p>(London) Today the House of Commons again paid attention to Chinese chicken eggs and the food of Chinese chickens. Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health, Shakespeare, replied to Conservative MP Hanlon's question, saying that he did not know whether he had studied the quality of Chinese chicken eggs in terms of food. What has been studied recently is the bacterial composition of Chinese chicken eggs. He heard that no spoilage occurred when chicken eggs were removed from freezing. Hanlon said that Chinese chicken eggs are produced under conditions that make people nauseous and should be immediately banned from import. Labour MP Lawson said that the standard of living of Chinese chickens is lower than that of British chickens. This remark caused loud laughter. Shakespeare replied that the content of eggs changes depending on the food of the chickens. It appears that the Ministry of Health has not yet received the resolution of the National Poultry Association's meeting on April 30 opposing the import of Chinese eggs. Shakespeare also reiterated the statement made by egg importers on March 13 that "no disease has ever been found to originate from chicken eggs from China" (Reuters Telegram, 13th)</p>

<p>(Moscow) At 3:30 this afternoon, French Foreign Minister Laval and Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Litvinov held their first talks at the Commissariat for Foreign Affairs, which lasted for an hour. No communiqué was issued afterwards. According to our correspondent, Laval informed Litvinov of the results of his talks in Warsaw, and then discussed the ratification of the Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Pact and reviewed the international situation. They also discussed the possibility of concluding a regional Eastern European pact when necessary, including the following points: (1) The signatory countries will not invade each other. (2) In the event of an invasion, they will consult each other and agree not to assist the aggressor country. Today, Laval visited Lenin's Mausoleum and is scheduled to meet with Soviet Communist Party General Secretary Stalin, Chairman of the Central Executive Committee Kalinin, and Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars Molotov tomorrow. Tonight, Foreign Commissar Litvinov hosted a banquet to welcome Laval. At the end of the banquet, Litvinov issued a statement saying that the establishment of the Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Pact is sufficient to prove that both countries want to actively guarantee peace in substance. Any country that feels interested in maintaining peace can join this pact. Laval replied that France and Russia freely unite their forces not only for the sake of defending their own security, but also to serve the general peace. All governments and peoples must work together to achieve the cause of international collective ties. (Havas Telegram, 13th)</p>

<p>(Moscow) Foreign Commissar Litvinov hosted a banquet on the 13th in honor of French Foreign Minister Laval, as well as Rosa Chat and Leger, who accompanied Laval to the Soviet Union. Soviet government members such as Voroshilov, Mezhlauk, Tsekoyan, Grinko, Bubnov, Krestinsky, Soviet Ambassador to France Potemkin, French Ambassador to the Soviet Union Alphand, personnel from the French Embassy, and senior officials from the Foreign Affairs Committee all attended the banquet. Litvinov and Laval exchanged speeches on the spot. After the banquet, a grand reception followed. Members of the diplomatic corps, government commissioners, senior officials from various People's Committees, representatives from Soviet public organizations, as well as figures from the scientific and artistic communities, and domestic and foreign journalists were all present. (TASS dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>(Moscow) In his welcoming address to Laval, Soviet Foreign Commissar Litvinov stated, "We can resolutely declare that the convention we have concluded is an instrument of peace. The first distinctive feature of this agreement is the fervent desire of those who drafted it to prevent the emergence of any circumstances that could hinder its implementation. The agreement itself will serve as evidence of the firm determination of the two major European powers to safeguard peace through active and practical means, and this is precisely how the aforementioned objective will be achieved. The second characteristic of the agreement is that it not only does not target any country, but also does not reject any country that is willing to join and willing to fulfill the tasks of the agreement. As the convention is an instrument of peace, it will inevitably strengthen and solidify existing instruments of peace. I am referring to the Covenant of the League of Nations. The convention concluded this time is a necessary supplement to the Covenant. This agreement, with a few exceptions, has won the support and sympathy of various countries and all true friends of peace. I dare to hope that the signing of this agreement is not the culmination of Franco-Soviet cooperation, but the beginning of such cooperation, which is beneficial to all countries when they are engaged in peaceful development in an environment where peace has not been disrupted." (TASS dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>(Moscow) In his reply to Litvinov, Laval first expressed gratitude for the warm reception. He then stated, "Your Excellency's expression of the Soviet government's policy reaffirms how deeply the Soviet people hope to participate in and bear the responsibility for building European security. We have created a tool for peace; this is the definition you have given, and it is the best definition of the Franco-Soviet pact. Our negotiations were indeed based on equal terms, and the conclusion of these negotiations is also based on equality. All rights and responsibilities on both sides are of an equivalent nature." Laval then expressed that peace is the most needed thing, so he hoped that other countries could also participate in this work of building peace. Laval added, "The realization of necessary amity among nations can be said to be a long and arduous task, so responsible political leaders must have patience and indomitable spirit. Both you and I possess this kind of spirit; this has been demonstrated by our actions. All countries have a collective obligation to international solidarity, because peace is indivisible. Therefore, we must engage in this, and from now on we will continue to appeal to the conscience of governments until this request is heard." (TASS dispatch, 14th)</p>

<h3 id="e27">Italian-Abyssinian Border Dispute: Italy Willing to Resolve Through Arbitration, Note to Abyssinian Government, Large Numbers of Troops Continuously Sailing to East Africa <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>(Rome) The Italian government issued a note to the Abyssinian government today, expressing its willingness to submit the border dispute between the two countries to the Conciliation Committee in accordance with the 1928 Italian-Abyssinian treaty. The Italian government has selected the Italian representative to the committee. The Italian government's move today follows the Abyssinian government's application for immediate intervention by the League of Nations in the Italian-Abyssinian dispute. The Abyssinian government's recent document to the League of Nations mentioned (1) the Italian government has asked certain national governments to prohibit their nationals from being appointed as arbitrators in the dispute; (2) denying the Italian claim that Abyssinia has issued a general mobilization order; and (3) declaring that the Abyssinian government is willing to accept the judgment of a fair arbitration tribunal. The Italian note to Abyssinia was just published, and the Italian newspaper simultaneously carried an article criticizing the partiality of some British newspapers, saying that any European intervention may encourage Abyssinian hostility and cannot weaken Italy's military power to defend its national rights. Although Italy is using troops in East Africa, if the work of reconciliation and cooperation that Italy hopes for fails, Italy's position is still capable of coping with any events in Europe. The dispute between Italy and Abyssinia arose from armed Abyssinians occasionally invading the disputed area between Abyssinia and Italian Somaliland. In recent months, there have been several clashes between the two sides. Mussolini, in order to cope with possible events, has sent tens of thousands of troops to Eritrea and Italian Somaliland. (Reuters dispatch, 13th)</p>

The mail ship "Dalmasi" will carry 570 officers and soldiers, and the mail ship "Bolun Chai" will depart on May 17, carrying 200 soldiers and ammunition. (Havas dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Abyssinian government has recently sent a note to the Secretariat of the League of Nations regarding the dispute between Italy and Abyssinia, stating that Italy has repeatedly mobilized and dispatched large armies to Italian-owned Eritrea and Somalia in East Africa. Therefore, Abyssinia requests the Council of the League of Nations to consider the situation created by Italy's actions, and states that the Abyssinian government has repeatedly requested the establishment of an arbitration committee in accordance with the 1928 Italian-Abyssinian treaty to resolve the Italian-Abyssinian dispute, but Italy has ignored it and tried to persuade foreign governments not to send representatives to participate when they receive requests to participate in the arbitration committee. For this reason, Abyssinia hopes that the Council will promptly take measures to resolve the Italian-Abyssinian dispute, so as to respect Abyssinia's territorial integrity and political independence. (Havas dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Secretariat of the League of Nations received a new note from the Abyssinian government today, but its full text has not yet been published. According to well-informed sources, the Abyssinian government is applying for the League of Nations to pay attention to certain new military plans of the Italian side and the fact that the Italian-Abyssinian arbitration committee has not yet been organized. If the conciliation committee has not been organized before the League of Nations Council meeting on May 20, the Abyssinian government requests that the League of Nations Council handle the matter. The Secretariat of the League of Nations is now publishing the additional agenda for the next League of Nations Council meeting. The dispute between Hungary and Yugoslavia is also included in the agenda. It is widely rumored here that the South Hungarian dispute can be resolved without causing major difficulties. The foreign ministers of the Little Entente countries will all go to Geneva to take the opportunity to hold preliminary talks on the Danube River conference. In addition, there are several issues related to the Free City of Danzig. (National Telegraph, 13th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) According to information obtained here, the situation of the dispute between Italy and Abyssinia is very difficult. Recently, British Ambassador to France Sir Clerk received instructions from the government to consult with the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs, so that Britain and France could jointly find a way to urge the establishment of the Italian-Abyssinian mixed arbitration committee. However, what kind of attitude Britain and France will take will depend on the outcome of the consultation. Now, the Abyssinian government has sent another note to the League of Nations Council, requesting it to handle it quickly in order to resolve the dispute between the two countries. In short, the situation of this dispute is very tricky. (Havas dispatch, 13th)</p>

<p>Warsaw: Marshal Piłsudski's body will be moved from the Belvedere Palace to the Cathedral on Thursday evening, where it will remain for thirty-six hours, so that the people of the capital can pay their respects to the Marshal's remains. As for when it will be transported from here to Krakow for burial, it may not be decided until Thursday evening, but the special train carrying the Marshal's body will definitely stop for a moment in the places it passes, so that the people can pay their respects. (National Telegraph, 14th)</p>
<p>Warsaw: The Polish President has appointed former Undersecretary of the Army General Gaspard Spierski to succeed General Piłsudski as Chief of the Army, and General Smilley to succeed as Inspector General of the Polish Army. The new Chief of the Army issued an order to the Polish army today, urging them to be loyal to the country, and ordered the entire army to read the President's proclamation. All troops will wear mourning attire, and officers of all ranks will wear black gauze. The Cabinet met today, chaired by Prime Minister Stavik, and decided on a state funeral for Piłsudski, and ordered theaters and other entertainment venues to close on that day. All military personnel will wear black gauze for six weeks. There will be no wreaths in front of Piłsudski's coffin. Government officials have donated 5,500 Zloty to build Piłsudski's tombstone in Krakow. (National Telegraph, 14th)</p>
<p>Warsaw: The tense emotions caused by the death of General Piłsudski have now eased somewhat. The government and the people are now preparing for the memorial proceedings in the coming days. All public and private houses are flying at half-mast, and theaters and cinemas are closed. Radio stations only broadcast funeral music and news about Piłsudski's death in the capital. Piłsudski's remains are displayed in the Belvedere Palace, and four generals stand guard in front of the palace. Mrs. Piłsudski and her two daughters are also by his side. Citizens from cities and villages are vying to go to church to pray for the deceased and the future of the country. Catholic churches are holding special services, and most of the participants are villagers. The simplicity of the villagers makes the solemnity of the worship ceremony even more apparent. Krakow is Piłsudski's birthplace, and his remains will be buried in the royal mausoleum there. However, Piłsudski's heart will be buried with his mother. Although the whole country is filled with grief, it is enough to show the strength of Poland, which is enough to overcome any national crisis. (National Telegraph, 14th)</p>
<p>Warsaw: The date for the funeral of the late Minister of Military Affairs General Piłsudski has not yet been decided, but it is likely to be on Saturday this week. The location will be Krakow, where the burial will take place. The Marshal's remains have now been placed in the coffin, and the lid of the coffin is made of crystal. It is scheduled to be moved to St. John's Cathedral tomorrow for public viewing. In general, the Marshal's remains will be carried by veterans of the European War from Kielce to Krakow, a distance of about 150 kilometers, which is expected to take three days. According to reports, in 1916, Piłsudski led Polish volunteers from Krakow to defeat the Russian army and capture Kielce. This time, he is following the opposite path to commemorate the Marshal's great achievements twenty years ago. The Cabinet ordered the entire country to observe mourning for six weeks. Before the funeral, all concerts and theaters will stop performing. It is rumored that German leader Hitler may come to pay his condolences in person. This news is not credible. The Italian government has decided to send its ambassador to Poland to represent the binding, and the Italian army will also send a special delegation to Poland. The French government will send Foreign Minister Laval and former Army Chief General Pétain to represent them at the funeral. Laval will stop briefly in Warsaw on his way back from Moscow.

<p>(Nanjing) The Judicial Yuan's meeting passed the implementation of the notary system and is currently drafting notary regulations. According to Tan Zhen, the Vice President of the Yuan, the notary system has long been implemented in various countries, but our country has not yet implemented it. Considering the current situation in our country, with so many lawyers and accountants, establishing separate notary personnel might create more disadvantages than advantages. Therefore, it is proposed to implement the notary system without establishing notary personnel. In the future, after implementation, the Ministry of Justice will designate a judge from each level of court to act as a notary, assisted by a clerk. This will achieve the practical benefits of notarization and avoid abuses. The notary regulations are expected to be submitted for discussion at the Judicial Yuan's meeting this month. However, this system is still a pioneering effort in our country, and it is planned to designate several provinces for pilot implementation first. (14th Dispatch)</p>

<p>Hangzhou Correspondence: Wang Kemin, member of the Executive Yuan's Beiping Political Reorganization Committee and Chief Advisor, is reporting to Committee Chairman Huang Fu on matters awaiting decision from the Beiping Political Reorganization Committee and seeking instructions on all matters. He and his wife and staff specially traveled south from Beiping to visit Huang at Moganshan. At 7:32 PM on the afternoon of the 12th, Wang Kemin, his wife and staff, and Wu Zhenxiu, the president of the Bank of China in Nanjing, and his wife arrived in Hangzhou on the Shanghai-Nanjing express train. Jin Runquan, the president of the Bank of China in Hangzhou, also happened to be returning to Hangzhou on the same train. He immediately sent cars to greet Wang and others to rest at the Die Lai Hotel on West Lake. At 8:30 AM on the 13th, Wang and Wu Zhenxiu and others traveled by car prepared by the Bank of China to Moganshan, arriving at Yucun Station at about 10 AM. They changed to sedan chairs to visit Huang Fu at his private residence at No. 509 to report everything and seek instructions. They attended a banquet hosted by Huang at his residence at noon. They left the mountain at 5 PM and returned to Hangzhou. At 7 PM, Jin Runquan specially hosted a banquet for Wang and Wu at the Laiyin Villa on West Lake. Huang Shaohong, Chairman of the Provincial Government, Xu Qingfu, Director of the Department of Finance, Zhou Xiangxian, the Mayor of Hangzhou, and Jiang Menglin, President of Peking University, who had arrived in Hangzhou the previous day, were invited to accompany them. The banquet lasted until 10:30 PM. Wang Shulu, Wu Zhenxiu, and their families took the Shanghai-Hangzhou early express train to Shanghai at 8:15 AM this (14th) morning. The reporter specially interviewed Wang at the station. According to Wang, this trip to Moganshan to visit Committee Chairman Huang was to report on the affairs of the Beiping Political Reorganization Committee and to seek instructions. Huang's arm and nose ailments have largely healed, and he could descend the mountain and go to Nanjing within the week to assume the concurrent post of Minister of Interior, but the date has not yet been determined. The situation in North China is currently very stable. The rotation of the war zone security teams is progressing smoothly and could be completed within two weeks. Regarding the Japanese ban on Chinese laborers leaving the customs, tens of thousands of Chinese laborers who had been lingering at various passes along the Great Wall have now completely left the customs. Other Chinese laborers within the customs are still continuing to enlist and leave the customs. The financial situation in North China is still good. Expenses are 80,000 yuan per month, which are allocated by the Central Government. The local income of Hebei Province is 20 million yuan per year. Income and expenditures are equal, and there is no deficit. After the Beiping Political Reorganization Committee abolished the agricultural administration group, it established a rural cooperative committee to handle rural loans at an interest rate of 4% to 6%. More than 2 million yuan were loaned out last year. Because the credit of the farmers is extremely good, more than 90% of the loans were recovered at maturity. The results exceeded expectations. Loans are still being made this year to benefit spring plowing. I will stay in Shanghai for about a week and then return north. I may need to visit President Wang in Nanjing to report everything.</p>

<p>Shantou News: The remnant bandits of Zhang Dingcheng's group in western Fujian were defeated by the National Army and fled into the mountains bordering Dabu and Raoping in Guangdong, causing great disturbance in Hecun, Dachan, Shangxiashan, and other places. The 80th Division of the National Army has already advanced into Pinghe. After recovering the bandit nest in Xianghu Mountain last month, they immediately telegraphed the Guangdong side to send troops to block them. Huang Renhuan then ordered Zeng Youren, the commander of the 1st Brigade, to move from Jiaoling to Huliao in Dabu, to supervise Chen Shaowu's troops stationed in Dabu and Ye Weihao's regiment stationed in Raoping to jointly suppress the bandits. Because of the lack of ammunition and food, Zhang's bandits looted in Shangxiashan and Xiuzhuan in Zhao'an, but were repelled by the militia. On the 3rd of this month, they fled back to Xiyanshan on the border of Raoping and Dabu. On the 4th, the garrison troops of Pinghe, Dabu, and Raoping divided their forces into three routes to suppress them. Kong, the commander of the Raoping battalion, occupied Lingtou, and the bandits retreated towards Jiuzizhang. At that time, the National Army had already advanced from Xiuzhuan in Zhao'an to the front of Shangrao Temple. The Dabu defense forces also mobilized from Shiyun towards Gangtou on the afternoon of the 4th to intercept the Zhang bandits' escape route. From the evening of the 4th, fierce fighting broke out between the two sides in the mountains. It is reported that Zhang's bandits have been surrounded, and a part of them scattered and fled downstream along the Han River. Deng Longguang's division also advanced to suppress the remnant bandits in Nanshan. On the 4th and 5th, they convened security meetings in Huilai and Puning and repaired power lines. It is reported that the Guangdong military ordered the two division commanders Huang and Deng to clear the remnant bandits on the Fujian-Guangdong border and in the Chaozhou area by the end of this month.

<h3 id="e81">Chen Mingge Discusses Improving Jinpu Railway Operations; Through Train Service Between Banpei Will Shorten Travel Time by Four Hours; More Than 300 Freight Cars, Coal Cars, and Locomotives Purchased <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>Beijing News: Chen Mingge, the acting chairman of the Jinpu Railway, recently inspected the entire line with committee member Qian Zongyuan, secretary Ye Shumiao, chief of the engineering department Wu Yiming, chief of the police department Gao Li'an, and others, to lay the groundwork for improving railway operations. This inspection was relatively thorough, lasting half a month for the round trip. Chen has already returned to Beijing after completing his official duties. According to Chen, his impressions from this trip and the main points of the railway administration reform plan for the 24th year are as follows:</p>
<p>Past Overview: Chen first stated that Mr. Qiu Gongjing, the former chairman of the railway, had been in office for three years. Considering the deep-rooted problems of the railway in the past, he was determined to focus on fundamental work, such as repairing bridges, replacing sleepers, and improving the work efficiency of employees, achieving great results. Since he took over as acting chairman, the fundamental work has been largely completed. The second step of the plan is to promote business, hoping that business will develop day by day. When Chairman Qiu passed away, the employees of the railway still worked hard and did not show any signs of laziness or unease. This point can be proved by comparing the business performance in March and April of last year with the same months this year. The business revenue in March last year was 1.8 million, and in April it was 1.78 million. The revenue in March this year was 2.12 million, and in April it was 1.8 million, with a total increase of more than 300,000.</p>
<p>Reform Plan: As for the plan to improve railway operations, it is roughly divided into three points and will be implemented starting from the 24th year. (1) Through train service between Banpei: The original travel time was 28 hours each time. Now, for the convenience of passenger and freight transport, it has been decided to shorten the time. On the 5th of this month, the transportation department conducted a trial run. Departing from Pukou, it took a little over 24 hours to reach Beijing, which is 4 hours less than the original time. After implementation in the future, not only will passengers have increased convenience, but the railway will also benefit greatly from the allocation of vehicles. This matter can be implemented after the Ministry of Railways convenes a joint transportation meeting on the 16th of this month. (2) Because the business of the railway has been progressing in recent years, the original passenger and freight vehicles and locomotives are not sufficient for allocation. Now, 300 new-style freight and coal cars have been purchased. Among them, some coal cars have the latest structure. Just by loosening the screws at the bottom of the car, the entire carload of coal can be unloaded in an instant. There are also 16 Emperor locomotives, which can also be shipped in November. (3) After the number of vehicles has been increased, the repair work will inevitably become more important. The railway's original machine repair factories in Peikou, Jinan, and Tianjin will be improved at the same time. The steps are divided into two aspects: (A) In terms of manpower, increase work efficiency. Currently, the workers in the three factories do not stop working even on Sundays, but they still need to intensify their work in the future. (B) Add more machines and boilers to make the equipment more abundant.</p>
<p>Inspection Impressions: I inspected all the important locations along the entire line, such as Xuzhou, Yanzhou, and Jinan, in detail. I am quite satisfied with the general situation. Since the promotion of the New Life Movement, the service spirit of the employees has been particularly evident. Regarding the troops stationed along the way, they all maintain strength. The purpose of our trip is to increase the efficiency of transportation to facilitate merchants and travelers. The above are all facts. There are many other plans that are still in the planning stage and I do not want to report them in advance to avoid the drawbacks of empty talk. (Daily News)</p>
<h3 id="e82">Rich Mineral Resources in Southern Anhui; Gold Mines Discovered in Jixi Lianchuan Ridge <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>Wuhu News: Huizhou [southern Anhui] has steep mountains, so it has extremely rich deposits, and the mineral veins are so abundant that they are almost everywhere. Several years ago, scholars in Jixi engaged in panning for gold sand, but ultimately it was difficult to attract attention due to inconvenient transportation. Abandoning the goods on the ground is quite regrettable. Since the completion of the Hangzhou-Huizhou-Wuhu-Tunxi highways, the name of Huangshan has been widely known for a time, and the number of travelers has also increased daily. As a result, many mineral products in the Huizhou mountains have gradually become known. The product exhibition along the Wuhu-Tunxi Road, which is currently being held, has collected various minerals and displayed them separately, which further proves the abundance of mineral resources. Except for the hematite mine in Yangjiawu, Jingzhou, which has recently been officially mined, the copper and crystal mines were both accidentally discovered. The copper mine is located in Anzhuwu Yinshan on the border of Jixi and Ningguo. Because nearby residents picked up mountain rocks and put them in a furnace, they found green light flashing and a crackling sound. It was once rumored as a strange story. After Jianhua verified it, it was confirmed to be a copper mine. Gold mines have appeared in Dalijiao Lianchuan Ridge in Jixi and have been widely rumored for a long time. There is a lot of gold sand mixed in the river gravel in that area. People mostly pan for gold with gold boats (a tool made for panning gold that looks like a boat). The method is quite clumsy, so the amount of gold obtained is also uncertain. Gold sand must be dug three feet deep in the pond to obtain it, but you must be familiar with water to be able to retrieve it. Those with skillful techniques and good luck can get a profit of two or three yuan a day, otherwise, they only get one or two jiao a day. Last year, Wang Fuquan, a professor at Fudan University in Shanghai, and Gui Bujun, a technician from the Ministry of Industry, went to investigate and dug up mineral samples, which they took back for verification. Recently, Jiang Shaojie, a mine merchant, presented it to the Anhui Construction Department, and the department dispatched technician Shen Guozhen to conduct a joint survey, intending to raise funds to mine silver mines in Xiawu, also on the border of Xuancheng and Ningguo. There is a huge cave with a diameter of 189 meters on the mountainside in that area. The geology is brightly pure white. After a little refining, it becomes pure silver. In the 16th year of the Republic [1927], a Mr. Chen dug up a sample and spent more than a thousand yuan to have it tested in Tunxi. He then felt that the transportation was inconvenient and the costs were too high, so he stopped. The current authorities are considering how to deal with this matter. (13th)</p>
<h3 id="e83">Current Traffic Situation Between Xi'an and Lanzhou; Fast and Comfortable, Far From What It Used To Be <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>Since the Longhai Railway trains reached Xi'an, the people of the country have been paying attention to the development of the Northwest. Some go to engage in business, and some organize groups to go for investigation. The news in the newspapers is endless. This kind of meaningful action is truly a great phenomenon in recent years. However, the Northwest has a vast scope, and Lanzhou in Gansu Province should be the key point. This is the destination of the general investigators of the Northwest, and it is also a necessary route. However, Lanzhou is far to the northwest of Xi'an, more than 1,400 li away from Xi'an. This kind of long journey inevitably makes those who enjoy comfort retreat. Here is a general description of the travel situation from Xi'an to Lanzhou for reference. The Longhai Railway has special express trains running east and west every day. The first and second class sleeper dining cars and food can satisfy the passengers in every way, so there is no need to go into details. When you arrive in Xi'an, the new-style hotels in the area have already opened, and there is also a feeling of being at home. Xi'an is the capital of Shaanxi Province, and the people and customs already have the Northwest situation. Moreover, the railway has just opened, and the local area is working hard on construction, and it is also an important emerging market. Those who want to promote domestic goods see this as a newly developed route for commerce. In the city of Chang'an, there are many things to see and do. Those who want to travel to famous places and enjoy the scenery, such as the majestic Mount Hua in the west and the beautiful hot springs of Huaqing Pool, are all near the Longhai Road and are also enough for elegant scholars to appreciate. Departing from Xi'an, there is the Xi'an-Lanzhou Highway operated by the Economic Commission, which has been open to traffic since May 1st of this year. It runs between Xi'an and Lanzhou once a day, and it takes four days to reach Lanzhou from Xi'an. The speed is still not slow. Compared with the previous camel and mule carts, the speed is ten times faster. Moreover, the road is equipped with ten newly purchased large-sized long-distance buses for passengers, each car can accommodate 30 passengers, the seats are comfortable, and the interior of the car is spacious. There are a total of twelve stations on the route, and the major stations are equipped with hotels and cafeterias. With the efforts of the Shaanxi and Gansu authorities along the way, the area is very peaceful. After this, the convenience for people traveling to and from the Northwest can be generally seen.</p>

<p>The county detention center currently holds more than ninety male and female detainees awaiting trial. A suspect named Zhou Linfu was sentenced to one month of imprisonment today and will be transferred to prison for execution. Before leaving, he asked the warden to ask Xu A'ba, a thief sentenced to sixteen years, for the return of a呢帽 hat and two thousand cash. Xu relied on his strength to deny it. Zhou identified him in the detention center. Xu had no words to evade, and the original items were returned. This was known by Cao Dalu, the director of the detention center, who found the deceitful minor offender to be hateful. He often brought Xu to the podium to admonish him, inflicted slight corporal punishment, and added fetters as a warning. Unexpectedly, after being punished, the criminal colluded with Li Zichen, Chen Defu, Pan Zhenggang, Yin Wenyu, and other criminals, using the reason that the rice was too little and the vegetables were too bad, and at 3:40, they rose up in a commotion, and the sound reached outside. Warden Cao telegraphed the county public security team and the political police of the public security bureau to rush to suppress them, and Yang Litang, the president of the court, and Zhu Xiyu, the chief prosecutor, persuaded them. They personally tasted the dishes, and the criminals began to eat. Fortunately, the storm was quelled.</p>

<p>Tao Shixiu, the weights and measures inspector of this county, during the inspection tour of the county chief and the head of the construction section in the various districts in April, arbitrarily convened a meeting of weights and measures inspectors from seven counties, publicly published the meeting minutes, and reported them directly to the provincial hall, causing the county government to have no record to check. County Chief Jin believed that this was a destruction of the administrative system and should be reported to the provincial hall for verification. It is now known that the order of the provincial hall has been received, dismissing inspector Tao Shixiu as a warning.</p>

<p>In this county's cities and villages, it is customary to welcome gods and hold festivals at the end of spring and the beginning of summer. Generally, idlers and ignorant villagers flock to them. Each temple takes turns to perform and compete for many days, wasting people and money. The authorities have never prohibited them. Today (the 13th) is the main day of Cao'an outside Chaoyangmen. All the temples in the southeast township must participate as an example. At noon, the parade starts at Ban Jingwan outside Chaoyangmen. The number of spectators is overwhelming. Anyone who wants to go from Henan to Hebei to watch must cross the Liu River, so temporary ferries are prepared to transport the spectators back and forth. After lunch, the ferry went north from the south bank, because it was overloaded, the boatman could not stop it. The boat was small and there were too many people, and the movements were inconsistent. In a moment, it sank, and more than thirty people on the boat were drowned. They tried their best to rescue them, but because the river was deep and the water was rapid, five people were unaccounted for. It was not until dusk that one person was rescued, but he had been dead for a long time, and there was no way to revive him. As of the time the reporter sent the manuscript, the other four people had not yet been rescued.</p>

<p>Wang Pijia, a local resident, was wanted by the county government last year for a case and has not yet been apprehended. It is now known that Wang sued County Chief Peng Baichuan for abusing his power and filed a complaint with the High Court.

<p>Zhu Wenyuan, the head of the county's autonomous experimental district, is doing business in Shanghai and has found it difficult to take care of district affairs. He has repeatedly resigned to the county government, but has not been approved. Now County Chief Peng has approved Zhu's firm intention to resign and has submitted a request to the provincial hall to appoint Xu Mingzhi, the head of the Xu Gongqiao Folk Education Center, to succeed him. It is reported that Xu went to take over the post immediately after being appointed.</p>

<p>At 12 o'clock the night before last, six or seven bandits broke into the Muguang Nunnery in Taoji Village, the second district, and robbed it. They first tied up Wang Fujin, who was watching the nunnery, threatened him with guns, and forced him to reveal the location of the silver. Then they opened the room of Pei Dayou, the principal of the Muguang Elementary School, and wantonly searched and robbed, losing more than one hundred yuan. Afterwards, Xu Junde, a policeman from the fourth post of the first direct detachment of Dongmen, found Chen Pengfu (also known as Binghua, 22 years old, from Changshu), a bandit in this case, near Tingzi Bridge. A lot of the original loot was found. Zhang Fusheng and Gu Hui, the landlord, two suspects were also arrested at Nanmen. Yesterday, they were all taken to the Public Security Bureau to await interrogation.</p>

<p>Zhang Rensheng, a resident of Xiao Zhang Lane in the fourth district (Kaiyuan Township), was 36 years old. He used to work in Yan Ji wonton shop outside Jixiang Bridge in Guangfu. In August last year, he became intimate with a southern woman surnamed Li. They lived together like husband and wife. In February this year, he was fired for something. Recently, Rensheng opened a Heji wonton shop next to the Fuchang Hotel in Xinmin Bridge. The concubine Li also lived in the shop. A few days ago, Li's husband found out that his wife was intimate with Rensheng, so he came to the city alone, slapped Rensheng a few times, talked about the conditions, and took Li back to his hometown. Rensheng suffered this setback, losing both money and people. He was angry and annoyed, and had the idea of ​​being tired of the world. So he committed suicide by taking poison the night before last. The landlord noticed it and sent him to the nursing hospital for treatment. Because the poisoning was too deep, he died immediately. It was also tragic.</p>

<p>At 10 am on the 12th, the second Shanghai-Taicang bus arrived at the east gate of this county. Approaching the station, the driver, Zhang Zhaofu, had already turned off the air valve. When he arrived at the station, he turned on the brakes. Unexpectedly, the brakes suddenly broke down and continued to move forward. The road to the station was already at the end. If he continued forward, he would fall into the low-lying farmland, which would be dangerous. The driver turned the steering wheel sharply to the south because there were many passengers. The south was the road from the station to the city street. There were many rickshaws parked on both sides. There were wooden posts in the road to separate the station. Many rickshaw pullers were waiting for passengers outside the posts, which was quite crowded. When the bus rushed out of the wooden stake boundary to the south, the driver waved his hands repeatedly, but the rickshaw pullers were caught off guard and could not escape in time. Three people were hit by the car. Two people were only slightly injured. Among them, Shi Qianlang, a native of Chongming, who lived in Lou Tangzhen, had a large hole in his thigh crushed by the wheel, and his leg bone was broken. He fainted immediately.

<h3 id="e93">Overview of Trade in Gansu Province in the Recent Three Years <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>— Zhu Jingzhou</p>
<p>I</p>
<p>The health of a country's economy can always be discerned from its imports and exports. A trade surplus or deficit is indicative, for a country with a trade deficit will inevitably experience a large outflow of cash. The result often undermines the economic foundation. Although China's current panic is significantly related to the U.S. silver purchase policy, the fundamental fatal wound remains the annual trade deficit of approximately 700 million yuan. This necessitates the export of a large amount of cash to offset the deficit. In the past, China relied on substantial remittances from overseas Chinese (estimated by American scholar Remer at approximately 316 million yuan in 1930. According to Zhu Jingzhou's investigation in 1927, remittances from overseas Chinese in the British and Dutch colonies alone to Xiamen, Shantou, and Guangzhou amounted to around 200 million yuan annually. If we include Europe, America, Australia, the Philippines, Siam, Annam, Yangon, Taiwan, Japan, and Korea, the amount would be between 400 and 500 million yuan). This helped to offset a large portion of the deficit, thus limiting the outflow of cash. However, since the global economic downturn, overseas Chinese have faced bankruptcies and are barely able to survive, leaving no surplus to remit back to China. Furthermore, there have been unfortunate incidents of discrimination against Chinese in South America and Japan. The sole means of offsetting the trade deficit in the past has now completely vanished, leaving no alternative but to transport cash. Thus, year after year, the outflow of domestic cash has increased. Even without the U.S. silver purchase policy, it would be impossible to sustain. However, the silver policy, which raised the price of silver, is even more detrimental to China's export trade, akin to a death warrant. In short, the nationwide rural bankruptcy and collapse of the economic foundation are the culmination of years of massive trade deficits, not a sudden occurrence.</p>
<p>II</p>
<p>As mentioned above, the trade balance is crucial to a country's economy. The same principle applies to a province. What was the state of trade in Gansu Province in the past? Without statistics, it is impossible to know. Since taking office, Zhu Jingzhou has recognized the importance of these statistics. He has classified and calculated various tax tickets from the Provincial Treasury's revenue items, starting from 1932. In that year, the total value of import and export trade was 60,699,307 yuan, with exports accounting for 14,656,196 yuan and imports accounting for 46,043,111 yuan, resulting in a trade deficit of 31,386,915 yuan. In 1933, the total value of import and export trade was 80,000,472 yuan, with exports accounting for 15,415,467 yuan and imports accounting for 64,585,005 yuan, resulting in a trade deficit of 49,169,538 yuan. In 1934, the total value of import and export trade was 63,653,989 yuan, with exports accounting for 2,252,372 yuan and imports accounting for 42,401,617 yuan, resulting in a trade deficit of 21,149,245 yuan. In total, the export value was highest in 1934 and lowest in 1932. The import value was highest in 1933 and lowest in 1934. The trade deficit was also highest in 1933. The total export value for the three years was only 51,324,035 yuan, while the total import value reached 153,029,733 yuan. The total trade deficit was 101,705,698 yuan (this import and export trade largely includes Qinghai). It is about twice the export value, which means that in addition to bearing various taxes, the people of Gansu Province had to spend a large amount of money on the trade deficit during these three years. Before the separation of Ningxia and Qinghai provinces, Gansu was known to have a population of 9 million. After the separation, it is estimated to be no more than 7 million. In recent years, due to natural disasters and man-made calamities, death, and migration, the population has sharply declined. According to the revised edition of the Encyclopedia of Daily Use published by the Commercial Press in 1932, the population of Gansu Province in 1932 was only 5,762,109, which seems more reliable. Based on this, the average burden for each person over the three years is slightly over 17.8 yuan, or slightly under 6 yuan per person per year. According to general opinion, the only way to offset this trade deficit is through the export of special products. However, since this year, a five-year ban has been implemented, with the first phase covering thirteen counties, including Gaolan, which has already been implemented. The economy of the people of Gansu Province will be in an increasingly precarious state. The reason why the trade deficit in 1934 was more than 28 million yuan less than in 1933 can be attributed to the following factors: (1) Rural bankruptcy, the social economy is declining, people's purchasing power is decreasing, stores cannot sell their inventory, and imports are also shrinking. (2) Gansu's economy has been based on the special product trade, but since 1934, due to the central government's widespread ban on opium, prices have plummeted, merchants have no profit to make, and they are all waiting and watching, resulting in a decline in imports.</p>
<p>III</p>
<p>In summary, there are several noteworthy points regarding the trade situation in Gansu Province during the aforementioned two years. These are discussed separately for imports and exports. (1) Imports: Among the imports, excluding miscellaneous goods, the most important items are cloth and cotton. In 1932, they were valued at 4,874,680 yuan, accounting for 10.58% of the total import value. In 1933, they were valued at 7,167,234 yuan, accounting for 11.11% of the total import value. In 1934, they were valued at 4,839,441 yuan, accounting for 11.43% of the total import value. Next is tea, including both official tea and loose tea (Gansu has tea permits, similar to salt permits in Jiangnan, called official tea. Tea traded freely by the people is called loose tea). In 1932, it was 2,353,040 yuan, accounting for 5.12% of the total import value. In 1933, it was 2,057,690 yuan, accounting for 3.19% of the total import value. In 1934, it was 1,769,126 yuan, accounting for 4.18% of the total import value. Next is paper. In 1932, it was valued at 1,269,950 yuan, accounting for 2.76% of the total import value. In 1933, it was valued at 1,561,320 yuan, accounting for 2.57% of the total import value. In 1934, it was valued at 1,973,620 yuan, accounting for 4.67% of the total import value. Next is food. In 1932, it was valued at 623,000 yuan, accounting for 1.35% of the total import value. In 1933, it was valued at 810,000 yuan, accounting for 1.25% of the total import value. In 1934, it was valued at 826,000 yuan, accounting for 1.95% of the total import value. (Appendix tables omitted). (2) Exports: Fur is the largest export. In 1932, it was valued at 7,088,670 yuan, accounting for 48.37% of the total export value. In 1933, it was valued at 6,640,172 yuan, accounting for 43.08% of the total export value. In 1934, it was valued at 10,058,197 yuan, accounting for 52.01% of the total export value. Next are medicinal materials. In 1932, they were valued at 4,879,155 yuan, accounting for 33.29% of the total export value. In 1933, they were valued at 6,119,777 yuan, accounting for 39.75% of the total export value. In 1934, they were valued at 7,058,856 yuan, accounting for 33.22% of the total export value. Next is water pipe tobacco. In 1932, it was valued at 1,175,099 yuan, accounting for 8.84% of the total export value. In 1933, it was valued at 2,217,099 yuan, accounting for 14.41% of the total export value. In 1934, it was valued at 1,841,701 yuan, accounting for 8.67% of the total export value. (Appendix tables omitted).</p>
<p>IV</p>
<p>The reason for China's trade deficit can be summarized in two words: "more consumption than production." Therefore, to reduce the trade deficit, we should strive for the development of various industries and take practical actions. The same applies to Gansu Province. Now, let's elaborate on the points discussed in the previous section.</p>
<p>(1) Promote cotton planting: The top import to Gansu Province each year is cloth and cotton. In the recent three years, the average annual import value is estimated to be over 9.6 million yuan, which is a significant outflow. The Northwest has a vast area suitable for cotton cultivation. At this time of phased opium prohibition, we must make every effort to promote it. The Central Cotton Improvement Institute has already allocated 200 dan of seeds. This issue can be said to be under development and will soon have significant results, which can be reported to those concerned about the Northwest problem.</p>
<p>(2) Promote small-scale papermaking: Paper is also a major import to Gansu Province, and it is increasing every year, reaching around 300,000 yuan. This is a good sign of the increasing cultural development in Gansu. If the weather is favorable and transportation is convenient, the demand will increase, and it will inevitably replace cloth and cotton. The Longnan and Longxi areas are rich in papermaking materials. A detailed survey should be conducted, and a simple introduction to papermaking should be printed to encourage people to imitate and manufacture freely, in order to save the situation.</p>
<p>(3) Open wool and leather factories: According to the export statistics of Gansu Province in the recent three years, fur production accounts for nearly 48%. If we only consider 1934, it accounts for over 52% of the total export trade. Its importance is evident. Fur is not only needed for ordinary clothing, but also has great value in military affairs. Since the fall of the Northeast, we rely solely on the Northwest. However, this matter is significant and requires a large-scale plan to succeed. Gansu Province has exhausted its financial resources after the devastation and may not be able to undertake this.</p>
<p>(4) Establish pharmaceutical factories: The output of medicinal materials is the second most important export in Gansu Province. The average export volume in the recent three years accounts for nearly 33% of the total and is increasing daily. Gansu Province produces the most medicinal materials, and the most famous ones are rhubarb, licorice, angelica, astragalus, etc. If factories can be established to manufacture locally, a considerable amount of outflow can be recovered. In recent years, the import of Western medicine has become a serious problem, and Westerners have made pills and tablets from rhubarb and angelica, which are sold exclusively in China. There is an urgent need to catch up.</p>
<p>(5) Promote tobacco planting: Lanzhou water pipe tobacco has been famous at home and abroad for a long time. According to Xu Peihuang, a German tested Lanzhou tobacco leaves and found that the cigars made from them were superior to those from Luzon, which shows the excellent quality. It has always occupied an important position in the history of Gansu's export trade. In recent years, due to changes in domestic preferences and excessive tax burdens, it has been declining year by year. According to the International Trade Bureau, the number of tobacco leaves imported nationwide in 1934 was 15.75 million gold units, which is alarming. If we can improve the seeds and expand the area, it will not be difficult to restore the past glory of Lanzhou water pipe tobacco. It will be able to reappear its active position in the export trade. The above is a fundamental plan to reverse Gansu's trade deficit. A plan should be established and implemented step by step. In a few years, the trade deficit will decrease naturally, and the national economy will have a prosperous future. This depends on the efforts of the Chinese people. As for the current palliative measures, the Provincial Treasury is revising the consumption tax rate with the following guidelines: (1) The import tax rate will be increased, and the export tax rate will be reduced. (2) Within the import tax rate, the tax rate on foreign goods will be increased, and the tax rate on domestic goods will be reduced. The tax rate on luxury goods will be increased, and the tax rate on necessities will be reduced, in order to remedy the situation for the time being. If this continues year after year, the entire economy of Gansu will be plunged into decline. Therefore, we have no choice but to adopt this tax policy for self-defense.

<h3 id="e96">He Bingxian Discusses Developing Overseas Trade; Establishing Agencies in Various Overseas Locations; Specializing in Introducing Domestic Goods and Promoting Them Overseas <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>According to the Xin Xin News Agency, He Bingxian, Director of the International Trade Bureau, recently took a train to Nanjing to meet with Chen Gongbo, Minister of Industry, to discuss strategies for developing foreign trade. He has now completed his official business and returned to Shanghai by train yesterday morning. A reporter from Xin Xin News Agency interviewed He at the International Trade Bureau yesterday and discussed the situation as follows:</p>
<p>Visiting Minister Chen to Discuss Developing Trade</p>
<p>According to He, he went to Nanjing to meet with Minister Chen to discuss the basic strategies for developing foreign trade. He also reported on the progress of guiding domestic goods manufacturers in Shanghai to voluntarily organize industrial and trade associations. Minister Chen has instructed the relevant departments to prepare for the implementation of measures to balance international trade. He expressed great approval for the establishment of industrial and trade associations by domestic goods factories in Shanghai, believing that this is an essential step in developing China's foreign trade. He instructed He to do his best to guide them so that they can be established as soon as possible. He plans to meet with the founders of the association tomorrow (today) to inquire about the preparation status and guide the progress.</p>
<p>Establishing Agencies to Introduce Domestic Goods</p>
<p>He denied the rumor that the Ministry of Industry will jointly form an international trade committee with relevant ministries to study ways to balance international trade. According to him, he had absolutely not heard of any such plan from the Ministry of Industry during his stay in Nanjing. It is difficult to find out where the above news came from. When asked whether the International Trade Bureau has specific measures to develop overseas trade, he replied that the reasons for China's foreign trade slump are multifaceted. However, the lack of knowledge about Chinese goods among overseas people, which makes it impossible for them to purchase them, is also a major reason. The Bureau is currently in contact with the industrial and commercial sectors and leaders of overseas Chinese in various places to establish domestic goods agencies in various overseas locations, specializing in introducing domestic goods. In addition, it will also set up domestic goods exhibition halls in various parts of Nanyang so that overseas people have a deep understanding of Chinese goods.</p>
<p>Details of Anti-Chinese Sentiment in the Dutch East Indies Are Unknown</p>
<p>In his last answer to the Xin Xin News Agency reporter's question, He said that the government had not yet received a detailed report when he was in Nanjing regarding reports that the government of the Dutch East Indies has recently abused overseas Chinese. The true situation is currently unknown. However, when Dutch East Indies Minister of Economic Affairs Hart visited Shanghai last month, he met with him and discussed how to promote the development of bilateral trade. At that time, Hart's attitude was quite sincere. If the Dutch East Indies government does have anti-Chinese incidents, Hart's words after returning should be more moderate.</p>

<p>In order to develop the rural economy, the Ministry of Communications conducted a trial rural loan in Hunan Province last year with excellent results. This year, it decided to expand the scope of the loan and first conduct trials in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces. All lending plans and implementation outlines have been drafted by the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau and submitted to the Ministry for approval. An office in Kunshan has already been established, and other locations can be established in order. Staff have been sent out for inspection. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Sending Staff for Inspection</p>
<p>The Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau sent Director Shen, Secretary Wang, and others to various places for inspection. Now, the Bureau has sent Secretary Wang to Jiaxing, Huzhou, and other places to continue the inspection in order to start establishing lending offices and start lending to farmers. Wang will set off in the next few days. According to Secretary Wang's statement to the Guomin News Agency reporter, these offices are divided into two types: Type A offices will temporarily use a standard of 200,000 loans, and Type B offices will lend 100,000 yuan. They will be established according to the needs of rural areas. However, if the amount of this loan is required by the environment, it can also be changed slightly.</p>
<p>Preparing to Establish Offices in Various Counties</p>
<p>After the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau received the order from the Ministry of Communications to conduct trial rural loans in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces, it began to prepare and actively carry out the work. Director Wang of the Bureau and Secretary Wang went to rural areas in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces for inspection. After returning to the Bureau, they drafted an implementation outline and submitted it to the Ministry for approval. The Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau immediately began to prepare for the establishment of lending offices in various counties. An office in Kunshan has already been established a few days ago. Offices in other places, such as Taicang and Yixing, are also actively underway and will soon be established.</p>
<p>Lending Outline</p>
<p>The Bureau has also drafted a rural lending outline, which has been approved by the Ministry of Communications. The outline is as follows: (1) For the convenience of external understanding and general recognition, the name of the rural lending should be named the "Rural Lending Office of the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau" and the name of the location should be prefixed to the office; (2) The guidelines for rural lending are as follows: There are two difficulties in rural lending: one is that genuine farmers cannot benefit from the loan, and at the same time, cumbersome procedures must be avoided; the other is that agricultural product production and sales are time-sensitive, and the establishment of lending institutions and pledge procedures should be noted. In terms of lending targets, it should be producers of agricultural products and merchants who are directly related to farmers, so that the effect of universal relief can be achieved. As for the lending method, at the beginning of the trial, pledge should be handled first, followed by agency savings and pledge remittance, and then agency savings and pledge remittance, so that the procedure has a consistent chain; (3) The steps for rural lending are as follows: Rural lending is a government policy to relieve rural areas. In order to facilitate the implementation of the Bureau and to make farmers understand the lending content, in addition to setting up propaganda items by the Bureau in public places, we will contact the local government so that the autonomous organizations in each township and town can widely publicize it to achieve the universal effect of lending; (4) The area of rural lending, in order to facilitate the implementation and supervision, it is proposed to take the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, where transportation is convenient, agricultural products are abundant, and there is a need for lending, as the initial trial area, and gradually promote it as a principle, and those with certainty. In this trial area, Kunshan, Changshu, Taicang, Suzhou, Yixing, Wuxi, and Liyang in Jiangsu Province are the first phase, on the one hand, to train practical talents for the preparation of promotion, and on the other hand, to use the trial method to seek the steady progress of the business; (5) Omitted; (6) Omitted; (7) The stacks are either designated by the Bureau to act as stacks, and pledge is made with receipts, or the stacks are rented by the Bureau, and stack fees are collected from the pledgers. At the same time, the Bureau plans to build warehouses in appropriate locations to achieve practical use.</p>

<p>In order to relieve the decline of China's industry and commerce, the Ministry of Finance planned to organize a 20 million yuan relief loan, of which 15 million yuan was used for mortgage loans. The Central, China, and Communications Banks, in order to increase capital to relieve industry and commerce, implemented mortgage loans to circulate the market. The remaining 5 million yuan credit loan was organized by the banks and money industry. It is reported that the 5 million yuan has been mutually recognized by the silver and money industries, and a committee will be established in the near future to implement the loan. As for the 15 million yuan, the Central, China, and Communications Banks have lent out more than 20 million yuan in January. The financial situation in this city has greatly improved after the end of April, and it is gradually becoming active. The silver and money industries have gradually returned the debts to the banks, and the market conditions of industry and commerce are also showing good signs.</p>

According to him, this trip to visit Chairman Huang was to report on the recent political situation in North China and to visit his illness, and there was no other task. Huang's illness has recovered more than before, and it is expected that the return to the north will not be far off. As for the rumors that Huang will go down the mountain on the 18th to take up the post of Minister of Internal Affairs in Nanjing, he did not hear about it when he was on the mountain, so he does not know the details. It is also learned that Song Ziwen, Chairman of the Bank of China, is Wang's director of the bank. This year happens to be his sixtieth birthday, so he held a celebration for him last night and invited many people from the banking industry to accompany him.</p>
<h3 id="e101">The Various Shipping Companies Should Give Priority to Employing Local Seamen; the Captains' Association Submitted a Request to the Ministry Yesterday <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>Recently, various shipping companies have frequently employed foreign seamen, which not only hinders our navigation rights but also causes local seamen to be squeezed out. The Merchant Ship Captains' Association yesterday submitted a special request to the Ministry, asking it to order various shipping companies to give priority to employing local seamen and not to hire foreigners. The original request is recorded below:</p>
<p>Submitting a request to order the Navigation Administration Bureau to instruct various shipping companies that, whenever there are opportunities to hire seamen, they should prioritize hiring local people to protect navigation rights and to provide relief to the unemployed.</p>
<p>Since China opened its ports to foreign trade, the crew members on merchant ships were initially mostly foreigners. This was because our country lacked nautical talent and had to rely on foreign resources, which resulted in the loss of sovereignty and the outflow of benefits, causing widespread grief. Fortunately, in recent years, the country has spared no effort in cultivating maritime talent. The graduates of merchant marine and fisheries schools, as well as those who have gained experience on merchant ships, are numerous enough to meet the needs of various vessels. Therefore, under the current circumstances, there is no need to employ foreigners any longer.</p>
<p>However, it has been recently observed that while some shipping companies are employing local seamen out of consideration for national rights, many others, disregarding the overall situation, still prefer to employ foreigners. Sometimes, they even go to great lengths to help foreigners without certificates pass through customs, while qualified local people with certificates are turned away, resulting in increasing unemployment. This is truly regrettable.</p>
<p>It is noted that the third extension of the seamen examination period will expire in June of this year. From then on, the seamen employed by companies should be judged by their certificates, and among seamen with certificates, priority should be given to employing local people. If this is done, unemployed local people with certificates can be helped, and the country's navigation rights can be gradually recovered.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is urgently requested that your Ministry order the Navigation Administration Bureau to instruct various shipping companies that, whenever there are opportunities to hire seamen, they should prioritize hiring local people. It is hoped that this request will be approved and implemented promptly for the public good. Respectfully submitted to the Ministry of Communications.</p>
<p>Another request states: Submitting a request for strict crackdown on seamen without certificates and for no further extension of the seamen examination period to maintain the rule of law.</p>
<p>Since the implementation of the seamen examination by your Ministry, nearly two years have passed. Those who comply with the law should have applied for the examination long ago, and those who pass should have certificates. Those who fail should not be allowed to perform their duties. This is the authority of the national law. In the past, your Ministry, considering the large number of seamen and the potential difficulty in examining all of them at once, has issued repeated extensions for the seamen examination. This was indeed out of genuine concern for the seamen, which is deeply appreciated. However, it has been recently observed that many seamen without certificates are still working safely, while many seamen with certificates are unemployed. This is certainly not the original intention of your Ministry's seamen examination.</p>
<p>It is noted that the third extension of the seamen examination period will expire in June of this year. Therefore, it is urgently requested that your Ministry refrain from granting any further extensions after this period expires so that unemployed seamen with certificates can be helped, and the authority of the national law can be maintained. It is truly for the public good. Respectfully submitted.</p>
<h3 id="e102">The Municipal Party Headquarters Strictly Orders All Levels of Party Branches to Vigorously Promote the Literacy Education Movement, and Orders All Organizations to Establish Literacy Schools; it is Estimated that 100,000 Illiterate People Can Be Eliminated in a Few Months <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Party Headquarters regards literacy education as one of the Party's seven major movements, and it is also the most effective way to improve public intelligence and revive culture. Now that the government is implementing it, mobilizing the entire social force is necessary to achieve the effect of division of labor and cooperation. Therefore, it was decided at the 169th Standing Committee meeting to organize a Literacy Education Promotion Association to coordinate the work and appoint Tong Xingbai, Wang Yansong, Li Suixian, Lin Meiyan, and Lu Jingshi as directors, with Tong Xingbai designated as the managing director.</p>
<p>The association has held several meetings and decided to promote literacy education in two ways: one is to be handled by party branches at all levels, with each of the ten districts and over two hundred sub-branches in the city establishing one school each. Each school will have two classes in the morning and afternoon, teaching one hundred people, totaling 20,000 people. The city has 7,000 party members, and each member is required to teach two people, totaling 14,000 people. The other way is to be promoted by various organizations. There are over 600 approved organizations in the city, such as agricultural, industrial, commercial, academic, and social and cultural groups. Each organization will establish one school, teaching one hundred people each, totaling over 80,000 people in the city. In total, over 110,000 illiterate people can be eliminated in February and March.</p>
<p>This is a general outline of the plan. It is heard that the Municipal Party Headquarters is determined to adopt an absolutely strict approach. Any party branch or organization that has the ability to hold literacy classes but delays or fails to implement them will be immediately disbanded or have its负责人(responsible person) replaced to serve as a warning to those with lax organization and poor leadership. At the same time, it is seeking the consent of the Bureau of Social Affairs to issue joint instructions, and will convene discussion meetings with various party branches and organizations in stages to actively promote literacy education. The details are recorded separately below:</p>
<p>Strict Orders for Preparations: For compliance. Literacy education is one of the seven major movements of our party, and it is also the most essential way to improve public intelligence. All comrades should exhaust their resources and talents to achieve this great undertaking. Now that the government is actively promoting it, we should serve the party and mobilize the entire population to achieve the effect of division of labor and cooperation. In view of this, our association has specially formulated two methods: "Methods for Party Branches at All Levels to Promote Literacy Education" and "Methods for Party Members to Promote Literacy Education." In addition to issuing a notice to all district party branches and sub-branches for compliance, we are also printing and distributing attachments for the sub-branches to comply with. From the date of receipt of this document, you are required to make preparations within two weeks, report them at any time, and open schools by June 20. Meanwhile, the executive committee member of the sub-branch is required to attend the Shangwen Elementary School on Penglai Road at 3:00 pm on the 18th of this month to receive instructions. Be sure to comply with this order.</p>
<p>Orders to Various Organizations: The Municipal Party Headquarters will use the existence and success of literacy schools as a standard to assess whether the organizations of various groups in the city are sound. It has already sought the consent of the Bureau of Social Affairs and issued joint instructions as follows:</p>
<p>For joint instructions: Literacy education is the most fundamental and essential way to promote public intelligence and revive culture. All citizens should exhaust their resources and talents to achieve this great undertaking. Now that the government is actively promoting it, it is impossible to achieve the effect of simultaneous efforts without mobilizing the entire social force. Moreover, various social organizations have the nature of serving the community and should bear the obligation of supporting public welfare. In view of this, our association and bureau have specially formulated two methods: "Methods for Various Organizations to Establish Literacy Schools" and "Implementation Methods." In addition to issuing a notice to all affiliated social organizations for compliance, we are also printing and distributing attachments for the association to comply with. From the date of receipt of this document, you are required to make preparations within two weeks, report them at any time, and open schools by June 20. Meanwhile, one responsible representative should be sent to the Shangwen Elementary School on Penglai Road at 9:00 am on the 19th of this month to receive a report. Be sure to comply with this order.</p>
<p>Convening Meetings: The Municipal Party Headquarters believes that the preparatory period has begun. Although various methods have been formulated, it is still necessary to convene separate meetings to explain the significance and methods of promoting literacy education in detail so that everyone can understand and achieve the effect of simultaneous efforts. Therefore, it is scheduled to convene a meeting of the executive committee members of each district branch at 3:00 pm on the 18th of this month and a meeting of the responsible representatives of various groups at 9:00 am on the 19th of this month at the Shangwen Elementary School on Penglai Road to hold important gatherings and provide as much instruction as possible.</p>
<p>Teacher Registration: When various groups hold literacy schools, they will need many teachers. Without careful selection, it will be enough to affect the prospects of literacy education. Therefore, a specific period is designated for literacy teacher registration. The original text of the proposed method is as follows:</p>
<p>Methods for Registering Literacy Education Teachers:</p>
<p>Article 1: Anyone who wants to be a literacy school teacher on behalf of the Shanghai Literacy Education Promotion Association should apply for registration according to this method.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Municipal Recruitment Team of the China Aviation Association previously sent letters to wealthy people in the city to raise funds for aviation to save the country, setting four types of donations: 5,000, 3,000, 2,000, and 1,000 yuan, according to their economic situation. The wealthy people all believe that the fundraising movement is an urgent matter and have successively paid the original amount, which is very enthusiastic. This has been recorded in previous reports. It is heard that the office received 1,000 yuan from Zhou Gangde Hall yesterday, which shows that wealthy people are enthusiastic about patriotism and generous in donating.</p>
<p>The Chief Team Leader's Office decided to display photos of aircraft named earlier and aviation slogans throughout the venue to increase the interest of participants when holding the musical event in order to arouse the public's interest in aviation. It is reported that Zhang Yuliang has been responsible for this arrangement.

<p>Yesterday, the local Hakka customs brokers and shipping companies received an urgent telegram from Wenzhou stating that the people of Wenzhou have always imported large quantities of foreign cigarettes and fertilizer, but now they have implemented a boycott and will not allow foreign cigarettes and fertilizer to be imported into Wenzhou. If they are imported, the people have decided not to allow these two goods to be landed. Therefore, all Hakka people are notified not to purchase them and ship them to Wenzhou again. If there is any shipment, it is determined that the people will not allow the two goods to be unloaded. Therefore, all Hakka are notified not to purchase and ship to Wenzhou again. If there is any shipment, the people have decided not to allow these two goods to be landed. Therefore, all Hakka are notified not to purchase them and ship them to Wenzhou again. If they are shipped in, the people have decided not to allow these two goods to be landed. Therefore, all Hakka are notified not to purchase them and ship them to Wenzhou again. If they are shipped in, the people have decided not to allow these two goods to be landed. If they are shipped in, the people have decided not to allow these two goods to be landed. If they are shipped in, the people have decided not to allow these two goods to be landed. It is reported that the people of Wenzhou have formed an inspection committee to prevent smuggling, sent inspection teams to all the pier terminals, and strictly investigated them. If they are found, they will be confiscated. Therefore, the operators in Wenzhou have secretly telegraphed to Shanghai yesterday to instruct them to stop processing foreign cigarettes and fertilizer, and immediately stop loading the goods that have been processed but not shipped, and do not go to that port to avoid disputes. The local shipping companies received the telegram and immediately informed all Wenzhou-bound vessels that from today (14th), any Hakka who have foreign cigarettes and fertilizer reported for loading to Wenzhou will not be accepted, no bills of lading will be issued, and they will not be allowed on board, to prevent the people from detaining the ships in that port, which would cause major negotiations.</p>

<p>Last year, the Carriage Department of the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Bureau amended and approved a special rebate method for transporting tea chests on the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway to encourage the transport of tea chests. Any merchant who transports tea chests from the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo line, the Nanjing, Hangzhou, Gengshanmen, and Gongchenqiao stations directly to the Qibeinan Rihuigang station, and who has registered a brand name with the railway in advance and paid a tea chest transport deposit of 500 yuan, will be given a special rebate at the end of each year according to the following standards. However, those who have already received a special rebate will not enjoy the ordinary rebate. Annual transport volume exceeding 50,000 chests: 1.5%; exceeding 100,000 chests: 3%; exceeding 150,000 chests: 3.5%; exceeding 100,000 chests: 4%; exceeding 250,000 chests: 5%. Now that the tea chest season has arrived, the company has stipulated that for tea chests arriving at the Maigen Road station, the freight rate will be calculated in the same way as for those arriving at the Upper North Station, and the specified weight of each chest and the special rebate method will also be handled according to the established plan.</p>

<h3 id="e111">Shipping Representatives Request Expansion of the Dredging Plan and Removal of滩艒艒(Tan Nu Nu) boats along the Beach <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>Xing Zhigang, a shipping representative from Pudong West, submitted a request to the Shanghai Municipal Government yesterday to expand the Shanghai South District dredging plan, remove obstacles along the beach, and reorganize water traffic to maintain the safety of navigation and travel. The document stated:</p>
<p>I submitted two requests in December 1933 and September 1934 to dredge the shoal from Dongjiadu to the South Wharf and remove obstacles along the beach. In response, your office approved the dredging section, which will be dredged around 1935. As for the request to remove obstacles along the area south of Dongjiadu, an order should be issued to the Public Security and Public Works Bureaus to investigate and handle the matter.</p>
<p>This year happens to be the time of the Huaihe River flooding season. Dredging has already reached the Bund outside the Wanjin Wharf. However, it is heard that this dredging will only extend to the Dongjiadu Wharf, and the area south of Dongjiadu is still not included in the plan. The area north of Dongjiadu is the area that should be dredged in the port, and the dock management office of the Public Works Bureau is already reorganizing it, so I do not need to discuss it further. However, the area south of Dongjiadu is currently a prosperous port for cargo loading and unloading for ships from various towns and villages in Shanghai, Fengxian, Nanhui, and Chuansha counties. It is also a place for large and small civilian ships to rush to dock. Now, bamboo, wood, and tree rafts are blocking half of the river, slowing the tide and current, and accumulating sand. If dredging is not carried out quickly, the harm to navigation will be significant. Furthermore, 滩艒艒(Tan Nu Nu) boats along the beach are crowding the port, hindering traffic. Cargo ships cannot dock and are forced to go far into the river, where they are hit by strong tides and accidents frequently occur. I have personally experienced this situation and cannot remain silent.</p>
<p>Therefore, I dare to repeat my previous request and urge you to examine the situation carefully and order the Public Works, Public Utilities, and Public Security Bureaus to take advantage of this dredging of neighboring ports and extend it to the South Wharf, uniformly deepening the area and removing the 滩艒艒(Tan Nu Nu) boats and obstacles along the beach to improve the waterway traffic on the Huangpu River and maintain the safety of navigation and travel. I would be extremely grateful.</p>
<h3 id="e112">Cixi Citizens in Shanghai Issue a Declaration on the Merger of Highways into Provincial Roads <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>Yang Yisheng and other citizens of Cixi in Shanghai previously submitted a request to the authorities to merge the highways in their county into provincial roads. Now, as holders of highway stocks, they have issued a declaration stating that the Cixi highway was built with 300,000 yuan, which was ordered by the provincial government to be allocated from the county tax revenue. At that time, the people deeply felt the country's financial difficulties and the urgency of suppressing bandits. Transportation projects could not be delayed. Even in the autumn of rural economic exhaustion, they had to bravely undertake this difficult task. However, since the operation of automobiles, the income of ticket holders has not been guaranteed. The reason for this is that the Cixi Road cannot be connected to the provincial road. The income of the highway business office is only enough to cover expenses. Not only is it impossible for the ticket holders to get their money back, but it is also difficult to develop the road. (Omitted)</p>
<p>Last year, our county suffered a major disaster. If the province does not prepare funds to recover and slightly alleviate the people's hardships, not only will administrative efficiency not be improved, but it will also be difficult to provide disaster relief.</p>
<h3 id="e113">Bean and Rice Industry Presents a Report: Proposed Measures for Opening Cuixiu Hall <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>The municipal government, in order to provide public access to the gardens within the city temple for sightseeing purposes, specifically instructed the Social Affairs Bureau to direct the relevant trade associations to discuss measures for opening them. Regarding the Cuixiu Hall, the Bean and Rice Trade Association has, after deliberation, drafted measures for opening it and submitted them to the Social Affairs Bureau. The original text submitted to the Social Affairs Bureau is excerpted below. Respectfully to the Director of the Bureau: We respectfully report that we previously received letter No. 3493 from your bureau, forwarded by the Bean and Rice Trade Association, which stated: Based on Municipal Government Instruction No. 3611, it has been found that the city temple is a must-see destination for both domestic and foreign visitors to Shanghai. However, the Dianchun Hall, Cuixiu Hall, and the three gardens within, which are exemplary of the inherent architectural spirit of our nation, have not been open to the public due to their association with various trade associations. This is regrettable, and leaders of the relevant trades should be contacted immediately to facilitate their opening for public viewing. In addition to separate instructions to the Public Security and Public Works Bureaus, the said bureau is hereby instructed to comply accordingly, to consult together, to set a deadline for opening, and to report on the progress of compliance. Upon receiving this instruction, we acknowledge that the fact that the temple gardens are not open to the public is indeed regrettable and that efforts should be made to open them for public viewing. It has been decided to hold a meeting at the Cuixiu Hall in the city temple at [time missing] PM on April 23rd. We respectfully request your attendance and participation in the discussion. Subsequently, at the designated time on April 23rd, a meeting was convened at our association's Cuixiu Hall by your bureau, bringing together representatives from various relevant agencies and organizations. The meeting resulted in a decision that representatives from the three industries would first convene their respective members to discuss the principles of opening to the public. They would then report the results of these meetings to your bureau before May 15th for further discussion. This has been recorded. Our association, in compliance, convened a meeting of all its members on May 9th. After serious deliberation, it was unanimously agreed that our association's Cuixiu Hall was established during the Daoguang reign of the Qing Dynasty. At that time, Yuyuan Garden had been neglected for many years and was in a state of disrepair. The Shanghai County Magistrate invited merchants to undertake repairs, stipulating that each trade manage specific areas as meeting places for their associations. Our bean and rice merchants undertook the repair of Sansui Hall, Cuixiu Hall, and other areas. Several years later, they purchased a portion of the site of the Kele Xuan and Wanhua Lou, namely the area around the Shenchi Tang, and established it as the association's headquarters. During the Taiping Rebellion in the Xianfeng reign, Western troops were stationed there, and the damage from one incident was particularly severe. Over the following years, repairs were carried out. The large artificial mountain in Sansui Hall was renovated in the seventh year of the Tongzhi reign. During the Qing Dynasty land survey, after the land was measured and mapped, the county magistrate issued an edict for bearing the land tax, and a stone tablet was erected to commemorate this. This arrangement has remained unchanged to this day. When our industry merged with other industries to form a trade association, this place was also used as the association's headquarters. For decades, members of our industry have used this headquarters not only for gatherings to discuss market conditions, study trade regulations, deliberate on public welfare, and manage association affairs, but also for the quarterly calibration of measuring instruments used by members. Furthermore, a school was established near Sansui Hall to promote education. All of these endeavors have been possible thanks to this headquarters. In recent years, due to the increasing complexity of association affairs and the expansion of the school, there are concerns that the space may be insufficient. As for the large artificial mountain, which has long been renowned for its scenic beauty, since the western buildings were converted into a playground and the area around the Nine-Bend Bridge to the south was opened to the bustle of the city, ascending it now offers nothing but a chaotic and disruptive view, and no longer resembles the tranquility of a mountain forest in the city. Moreover, the mountain rocks are rugged and uneven, and the paths are winding and narrow. While a small number of people can still wander around, it is doubtful whether it is suitable for the enjoyment of a large number of people. Therefore, our industry has carefully considered the matter of opening the Hall to the public, and we genuinely feel that there are significant obstacles. However, we admire the City Government and your bureau for thinking of the public and creating areas for sightseeing, which is something that everyone supports, and our industry is especially in agreement. Therefore, how could our industry not strive to comply with public sentiment and uphold your intentions? We have, in the face of these obstacles, devised a method of adaptation. The members of our industry have decided to voluntarily open the hall to the public for one day each week, taking advantage of the school's holidays. However, as our association has a school in the front and a headquarters in the back, the areas open to the public must be demarcated, and the large artificial mountain is winding and difficult to navigate, and precautions must be taken to prevent accidents, thus some regulations are necessary. These two points still require detailed planning by the organizing management committee, and further details will be submitted in due course. We are now submitting the results of the discussions among our industry members in this letter, respectfully requesting your consideration. With utmost respect, we wish you good health. Shanghai Bean Industry Cuixiu Hall.</p>
<h3 id="e114">Aviation Lottery: Starting from the Fourteenth Issue, Award Amounts Will Change: First Prize to Be Changed to 250,000, with Additional Prizes; Report Has Been Drafted and Awaiting Approval from the Ministry of Finance <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>According to the Dagong News Agency, the Shanghai office of the National Government Aviation Highway Construction Lottery announced yesterday that it has decided to change the lottery's prize amounts starting from the fourteenth issue and to add two first, second, and third prize bonus prizes. This will be implemented after approval from the Central Political Council. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Changing the Policy: Since its inception, the aviation lottery has enjoyed a strong reputation. Sales for the twelfth issue recently closed, with over 300,000 to 400,000 tickets sold. A Dagong News Agency reporter recently heard rumors that the office was planning to change its policy and increase the prize amounts starting from the fourteenth issue. Yesterday, the reporter visited Mr. Sun Disheng, the chief of the office's First Section, who stated that the office had previously discussed increasing the lottery's prize amounts, but this had not been implemented due to certain reasons. While the current proposal is still under consideration, the general outlines have been decided. The office will submit a formal request to the Ministry of Finance, which will then forward it to the Executive Yuan for submission to the Central Political Council. The changes could be implemented as early as the next issue, or as late as the fourteenth issue.</p>
<p>Increasing Prize Amounts: Regarding the prize amounts, the office plans to increase the first prize to 250,000 yuan for the sake of greater popularity, and add two first prize bonus prizes of 5,000 yuan each. Two second and third prize bonus prizes will also be added. In addition, the office plans to modestly increase the value of other smaller prizes by tens of thousands of yuan. Regarding the price of tickets, the office does not wish to sharply increase the price, as it wishes to encourage the public to take an interest in aviation and highway construction. However, while the office has reached an agreement on these points, they are still subject to the approval of the authorities, and it is uncertain whether these changes will be approved. The office is currently preparing the formal request, which will be submitted to the Ministry of Finance within the next day or two.</p>
<h3 id="e115">Hebei Native Place Association Petitions for Extension of Yellow River Disaster Lottery for Another Year <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>The Hebei Native Place Association has submitted a document to the Executive Yuan and Ministry of Finance of the National Government, petitioning for the extension of the Yellow River disaster lottery for another year to raise funds for disaster relief. The document states: This association has recently received representatives from the Yellow River disaster area in southern Hebei, Tian Jianai, Guan Zhaofeng, and others, representing hundreds of thousands of people from southern Hebei. They stated that since August of the 22nd year of the Republic [1933], the Yellow River has flooded, with torrential waters breaching both the north and south banks of Changyuan County in southern Hebei. As a result, the three counties of Chang, Pu, and Dong were instantly turned into a swamp. The severity of the disaster and the scale of the losses are unprecedented. Subsequently, due to the lack of a steady stream of disaster relief funds from various sources, hundreds of thousands of disaster victims were left starving, and the various post-disaster measures in the disaster area were urgently needed. As a last resort, in June of last year, the association petitioned the Peiping Political Readjustment Committee for permission to issue a Yellow River disaster lottery for one year to provide relief. The lottery was specifically established to provide relief for the Yellow River disaster of the 22nd year of the Republic and to carry out various post-disaster measures. Unexpectedly, not long after the lottery was launched, the Yellow River breached its banks again in Chang in August of last year, causing an unprecedented catastrophe and repeating the disaster a second time. The villagers of Chang, Pu, and other counties who were submerged in the floodwaters have now been suffering for ten months. The length of the disaster and the scale of the losses are even greater than the previous breach. Because Hebei Province is facing a severe financial crisis and sources of disaster relief funds from various sources have dried up, the only reason why the disaster victims in the three counties have not died of starvation or drowning is the 50,000 yuan of regular monthly income from the Yellow River disaster lottery. Although the Guantaikou gate has now been closed, the water has not completely receded, and there is no prospect of planting. Hundreds of thousands of disaster victims are still starving, and after the great disaster, the villagers in the disaster area have lost all their houses, property, livestock, and agricultural tools. The misery of the disaster is unparalleled, and the urgency of the need for help is immediate. It is now planned to continue providing relief to the hundreds of thousands of disaster victims to prevent them from dying, and to carefully plan for post-disaster recovery, handling agricultural goods, and restoring the countryside, so that the disaster victims can have the strength to cultivate and gradually recover and recuperate. In order to reverse the catastrophe, a total of at least 600,000 yuan is needed. The provincial government has exhausted its resources and has no way to raise this amount. The Yellow River disaster lottery will expire on the 15th of this month. If it is not continued, there will be no disaster relief funds, and all the above-mentioned relief and post-disaster recovery measures will inevitably be mere empty talk. The hundreds of thousands of disaster victims will still be displaced. We have always admired your association's concern for our hometown and ask for your support in appealing to the government. We believe that it is the government's responsibility to rescue those in distress. Since the provincial government's finances are exhausted, the central government should provide overall consideration and assistance. The Yellow River disaster lottery has a strong reputation and has achieved remarkable results. The current arrangement should be allowed to continue for another year to raise funds for disaster relief. Knowing this, how could this association remain silent? Therefore, we are presenting the above facts and earnestly requesting your Yuan (Ministry) to consider the disaster victims and to approve the extension of the Yellow River disaster lottery for another year, starting from the 15th of this month, to save the starving and drowning and to reverse the catastrophe. This would be in the public interest. Respectfully submitted to the Executive Yuan (Ministry of Finance) of the National Government by the Hebei Shanghai Native Place Association. Chairman: Hong Yi.

<p>Shanghai Postal Administration Notice No. 1221 states: Parcels destined for Hami, Turpan, and Dihua in Xinjiang Province can now be delivered by long-distance bus service from Xinjiang and Suiyuan, which is faster than delivery by camel caravan between Gansu and Xinjiang.

The current rates will still apply to parcels sent by camel. However, the bus freight rates on this route are exceptionally high. The new parcel rates are now specified as follows: (1) Parcels to Hami will be charged twelve basic pure fees. (2) Parcels to Dihua and Turpan will be charged fifteen and a half basic pure fees. (3) Parcels to Hami, Turpan, and Dihua from stations in districts where wheel-and-rail transport is not available will be charged an additional basic pure fee on top of the above rates.

<p>Mr. Zhang Wendi, a prominent jeweler in this city, has spent several years commissioning dozens of master craftsmen to create a jade pagoda. This pagoda was previously collected for the Century of Progress Exposition in Chicago, USA, and was transported there for exhibition, where it was highly praised by the people of that country. The exquisite craftsmanship is considered to be the finest jade work in recent years. Mr. Zhang returned to China at the beginning of the year. In order to promote the art of carving in our country, he is preparing to hold a jade exhibition in this city and is currently collecting works. According to Mr. Zhang, the number of jade craftsmen in the country has been gradually decreasing in recent years. The art of learning this craft is very difficult, and the impact of the economic downturn has further led to the decline of the jade industry. If it is not promoted, it may soon become a lost art.</p>

<p>Liu Tangyou, a gentryman of Shaoyang, Hunan, was erudite, versatile, and a book lover. He often donated large quantities of books to cultural institutions, and devoted himself to cultivating young people, expending all his energy. He made many efforts in the field of education. When he was lying sick in bed last year, he regretted that the educational institutions he founded in his hometown had not yet been greatly expanded. As he was nearing death, he instructed that a set of "Four Books and Five Classics", "Thirteen Classics", "Comprehensive Mirror for Aid in Government", "Collected Works of Philosophers", "Neo-Confucianism Works", "Anthologies" and "Poetry and Prose Criticism" and other books be purchased, totaling more than 4,000 volumes, 3,000 copies, and 200 types, worth several thousand yuan, and donated to the Shaoyang Public Education Library and the cultural institutions in its vicinity. His younger brother, Fan You, has now begun to carry out his instructions to order the books.

<h3 id="e125">Parricide by Strangulation Case Adjudicated: Yu Huogen and His Daughter-in-Law Straightforwardly Admit to Strangulation: Pouring Out Grievances about the Son's Heinous Deeds, Old Man Weeps Copiously <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>Yu Huogen, a farmer from Yujiagang Township in the western part of Hexiang in the southwestern countryside, due to his rebellious son Yu Guanhong (i.e., Yu Jisheng)'s failure to engage in honest work, sinking into depravity, and addiction to red pills and morphine injections, stealing openly and covertly, and committing all kinds of evils, hated him to the bone. He colluded with his daughter-in-law, Yu Chen (i.e., Guanhong's wife), and strangled Guanhong to death with a rope on the night of the tenth day of the third month of the lunar calendar this year while he was asleep. After the incident, the police station detained and sent Yu Chen to the local court for interrogation and detention. Prosecutor Lei Binzhang arrived at the scene to examine the body and have it placed in a coffin. Yu Huogen was originally supposed to be arrested and detained, but because he was suffering from severe dropsy and was over sixty years old, he was handed over to the local headman for supervision. The magistrate prosecuted Yu Huogen and Yu Chen for violating Article 284, paragraph 1 of the Criminal Code and requested a public trial in the Criminal Court. It is now learned that this case was heard yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM by Judge Zhang Shao in the specially opened Fifth Court. Yu Chen, who was in custody, was brought to the stand. She testified that she was 34 years old and had one son and two daughters. Her husband, Yu Guanhong, was lazy and did not work. He was addicted to red pills and morphine injections. He would steal clothing and other items worth a little bit to sell and also steal clothing from other people's houses, as well as things planted in the fields. He also threatened to set fire to the house, which caused the whole family to suffer. Even if we went to court, this kind of bad person should be shot. Asked, "How exactly did your husband die?" She replied, "He was killed by my father-in-law (referring to Yu Huogen)." Asked, "Did you and your father-in-law kill him together?" She replied, "Yes." Asked, "Who caused the injuries on your husband's head?" She replied, "My father-in-law hit him. He was angry because he was unpromising and did not learn well, so my father-in-law became ill from anger." Asked, "Did your father-in-law discuss it with you beforehand?" She replied, "He told me several times. I couldn't bear to do it." Asked, "Then why did you still kill him?" She replied, "Because he said he would definitely set fire. I have been a child bride in this family since I was seven years old and have suffered all kinds of hardships." Asked, "How could you bear to kill your husband, with whom you have been married for so many years?" She replied, "He was stealing things all day long, and his face was gaunt." Asked, "How does your family survive?" She replied, "I earn money by making lace, supporting my father-in-law and three children. We eat two meals of thin porridge a day." When she testified, her eyes were filled with tears, and she looked extremely miserable. (She was wearing tattered clothes and looked timid, truly a poor village woman.) Next, Yu Huogen testified that he was 64 years old and had two sons. The eldest son was Guanhong, and the second son was Guansheng. The second son died of illness last spring, leaving behind a blind daughter-in-law. Asked, "Is Guanhong your biological son?" He replied, "Yes." Asked, "How many people were involved?" He replied, "I did it alone. I strangled him with a belt. I killed him while Guanhong was asleep. I got on the bed and sat on him and killed him. He stole things from the house and sold them, even tearing down and selling the bricks and tiles from the grave of his dead mother to fuel his addiction to red pills and morphine. Half of the house has been torn down, and the bricks and tiles have been continuously transported out and sold cheaply to support his red pill and morphine addiction." Asked, "Why didn't you send him to the vagrant work training center?" He replied, "I asked someone to introduce him, but the center was full and could not accommodate him, so he was rejected." Asked, "How did Guanhong treat you usually?" He replied, "He was extremely fierce and often beat me, even trying to kill me with a knife, claiming that killing his father would only get him three months in jail." Asked, "Is your daughter-in-law well-behaved?" He replied, "She is well-behaved. If you don't believe me, you can investigate. If she has any misbehavior, please have her shot." Asked, "Did you and your daughter-in-law discuss it beforehand?" He replied, "We talked about it once this year, and several times last year, because the rebellious son recently threatened to kill me, so I struck first." Asked, "Has your dropsy been relieved in recent days?" He replied, "I can't urinate, and my belly is as hard as a drum. This illness was also caused by anger," and so on. The magistrate ordered Chen Wentang, the local headman of the 28th district, to be brought to the stand and asked, "How is Yu Huogen as a person?" He replied, "Very good." Asked, "How is Yu Chen?" He replied, "Also good, usually very well-behaved, but very miserable." Asked, "How was the deceased as a person?" He replied, "The deceased was very bad. Stealing things, eating red pills, injecting morphine, committing all kinds of evils, he was really a scoundrel. I am willing to sign a guarantee." At this point, Prosecutor Lei Binzhang came to the court to make a statement, briefly stating that the defendants had confessed without reservation, and that Yu Huogen's actions were excusable. He asked for leniency. The appointed lawyer, Hu Yuanjun, then rose to defend them. The magistrate then asked Yu Huogen, "Who else is in your family?" He replied, "One grandson, nine years old, and two granddaughters, fourteen and eleven years old. Since my daughter-in-law was taken into custody, we have been without a livelihood. I go out to beg every day to support the three children." After he finished speaking, he wept copiously, moving those who heard him. The magistrate then asked the local headman, Chen Wentang, whether Yu Huogen's testimony was false. Chen replied, "It is indeed the truth." The magistrate felt compassion for them and announced the end of the arguments and ordered that a judgment would be issued later. He also instructed the local headman to take Yu Huogen back to be supervised, and Yu Chen was returned to custody to await further instructions.</p>
<h3 id="e126">Renji Hospital Nursing School Graduation Ceremony Grand Occasion <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>Serving the People - City Health Bureau Director Dr. Li Yan'an, in his speech at the Renji Hospital Nursing School graduation ceremony yesterday, said, "…Do not imitate the Shanghai ladies; we must promote the power of love and serve the people…" Dr. Li's so-called Shanghai ladies refer to young women who spend their days decorating themselves, socializing, wasting time, and doing nothing.</p>
<p>Certificate Presentation Ceremony - The Renji Hospital Nursing School of the McGar Circle was established twenty years ago and is one of the earliest Chinese group nurse training institutions. Yesterday was the graduation day for the 1935 class. At 3 p.m., the certificate presentation ceremony was held in the auditorium on the third floor, presided over by Dr. Patterson, the hospital director. Mrs. Li Yan'an presented the certificates. This year's graduates totaled thirty-four, mostly female, which is why Mr. Li's speech emphasized this.</p>
<p>With the Lord - Guests, students, etc., gathered together, numbering no less than two hundred. The nurses wore blue and white uniforms, neat and clean, reflecting the purity and nobility of their profession, giving a deep impression. At 3 o'clock, Chairman Dr. Bai announced the opening of the meeting, and the group sang the hymn "With the Lord." Dr. Bai then delivered a speech, briefly describing the past situation of the school and expressing his gratitude to the faculty and staff, as well as Dr. and Mrs. Li. Dr. Bai spoke Chinese quite fluently, and when expressing his gratitude, he raised his hands in a traditional Chinese greeting, his sincere feelings overflowing in his words.</p>
<p>Renji Hospital Nursing School Graduation Ceremony</p>
<p>Two Points of Hope - The chairman hoped for two things from the graduating nurses. The general idea was: (1) Do not regard this graduation examination as the final test. In the future, when dedicating yourselves to serving the people, you will be tested by patients and work. You should encourage each other even more. (2) Patients suffer not only from physical illness but also from spiritual pain. As nurses, you should use the spirit of Christ's love for others to relieve the suffering of both body and soul. Most of this year's graduating nurses, except for a very few, are Christians.</p>
<p>Great Nursing Power - Li Yan'an gave a speech after Pastor You read the scriptures and Dr. Bai stood up. The wonderful few sentences about the local scenery have been mentioned before. Li first stated that the Chinese people have never asked for lingering and painful tuberculosis, etc., which spread everywhere, and countless people die unjustly. Nursing talents are not only needed but should also be valued. Then, he described his experience of almost dying from an illness in a rear hospital nine years ago. Li said, "If it weren't for the great power of nursing care, I might have left this world long ago and wouldn't be able to gather with you all." Finally, he gave four pieces of advice: don't be afraid of hard work, be thorough and rigorous in your work, treat patients with the utmost love, and enhance the status and personality of nurses. Li mentioned in his speech that his niece is currently studying nursing at the Central Hospital in the capital and will soon graduate.</p>
<p>Two Songs - Everyone present was moved by Mr. Li's words, and applause thundered for a while. Then, students from Qingxin Girls' High School sang two famous songs, "Spring" and "River of Minadong," which were melodious and pleasant, captivating the listeners. The whole place was filled with a pure and lively atmosphere. Head Nurse Miss Xie Po thanked the guests in the lingering sound and encouraged the graduates with the three words: Faith, Hope, and Love.</p>
<p>Nurse Nominations - Finally, Mrs. Li presented the certificates, representatives of male and female students expressed their gratitude, and Pastor You Shuxun prayed, and the ceremony ended. The list of this year's graduates is as follows: Xie Jiuru, Jin Yuexian, Chen Ling'en, Huang Hualing, Chen Deying, Wang Jiemin, Sun Binzhen, Zhang Derun, Shao Huili, He Suquan, Bi Shijun, Pan Yongfu, Shao Dazhen, Geng Shuqing, Shi Huijun, Zou Shanmei, Chen Yueqin, Zhang Yanbin, Zhu Jinxia, Lin Shiyu, Ji Weiru, Han Huizhu, Shao Guilong, Huang Zhong, Mou Weikang, Wang Weixian, Bi Baogen, Xu Rujie, Tao Quanwen, Jiang Xiaocang, Ma Youfu, Shi Guozhen, Zhou Zanyu, Chu Lin.</p>

<p>Four major foreign oil companies in the city, Mobil, Asiatic Petroleum, Texaco, and 油遍地, have reduced the retail prices of kerosene and gasoline due to the sluggish market and weak purchasing power. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Kerosene Prices Reduced Across the Board by Thirty Cents</p>
<p>According to kerosene industry insiders, the British, American, and Russian oil companies in the city have reduced prices to maintain their Chinese market share. The price of kerosene has been reduced from $8.50 to $8.20 per ten gallons, a decrease of thirty cents. The oil companies claim that due to the low gold prices abroad and the weak exchange rate, there is very little difference compared to the previous prices.</p>
<p>Gasoline Prices Also Fall</p>
<p>Gasoline prices also fell yesterday. Loose gasoline is now sold at 87 cents per gallon, barrel gasoline with the empty barrel returned is sold at 90 cents per gallon, and canned gasoline is sold at 93 cents per gallon, an average decrease of four cents compared to the previous price. Further increases or decreases will be considered based on market demand.</p>

<h3 id="e129">Nanyang Islands: Decline in Sales of National Porcelain Due to Dumping of Japanese Porcelain <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>According to the International Trade Bureau yesterday, the products exported from our country to the Nanyang Islands for sale are mainly tea, red tobacco, and groceries. Porcelain also has a fairly large annual import volume to the Nanyang Islands. However, in recent years, the porcelain from Jiangxi, Dehua, and Shantou, which used to sell for millions of dollars in the Southern Islands, has also been greatly affected, and business has plummeted. The biggest reason is the competition and dumping of Japanese porcelain. It is found that Japanese porcelain already accounts for 80-90% of the various porcelain shops in Nanyang. Japanese porcelain is not only less than half the price of products from our country, but even the styles and shapes are similar to our products. Therefore, national porcelain is almost at the end of its strength in Nanyang. It is found that most of those engaged in the porcelain industry are from Fujian and Chaozhou. There are two sources of porcelain: Jiangxi products, mostly fine porcelain, and some porcelain products similar to antiques, such as porcelain Buddhas, vases, and stove bricks. Products from Shantou and Dehua are mostly coarse porcelain, such as bowls, plates, jars, and cups. With the recent import and sale of Japanese porcelain to the Nanyang Islands, all kinds of supplies are available. At first, the colors, styles, and shapes were easily distinguishable, but recent products are difficult to distinguish. Unless one is experienced in the industry, it is not easy to immediately distinguish the origin of the goods. According to people in the industry, the method of identifying porcelain can be simply divided into two categories: first, by form and use; second, by material. Regarding the first, there are several points: First, the form and painting of Japanese porcelain are quite artistic. The brushstrokes are close to the new style, and the colors are rich and bright. Among our country's products, the painting of Jiangxi porcelain can be considered exquisite, but the painting is fine, and the color tone is ultimately not as bright as Japanese goods. Shantou products are even inferior to Jiangxi porcelain. Second, the shapes of Japanese porcelain are mostly similar. Products from Shantou and Dehua often have uneven forms. Third, Japanese porcelain has very fast heat transfer. When filled with hot water or boiling soup, it often feels hot to the touch. Jiangxi products, because of the tight material structure, transfer heat more slowly. Shantou porcelain is the same. The second category is material, and there are also several points: First, Japanese porcelain is very light in weight. Jiangxi and Shantou porcelain are very heavy in weight. Second, the material of Jiangxi and Shantou products cannot be purely white, and the reflected light is quite strong. Third, when dissecting Jiangxi, Shantou, and Dehua porcelain, the material inside is dense and solid, while the material structure of Japanese porcelain is looser and has fine pores like slight fermentation, which is why it is so light in weight. If we pay attention to the above situation, we can surely tell the origin of the porcelain at a glance.</p>

<p>Cheng Cuiying, a young woman from Zhenjiang, living at No. 3 Shoufuli, Rongshi Road, Taiping Bridge, French Concession, accompanied by her younger sister Xu Xiuzhen, was walking west of Chenshi'an Bridge, Fangbang Road, at around noon the day before yesterday when two robbers suddenly caught up and forcibly grabbed the gold bracelet on Cuiying's arm. Because she resisted, she was shot in the head by the robber and fell to the ground. The robbers succeeded and fled without a trace. After the police station in charge sent Cheng Cuiying to Shanghai Hospital for treatment, she died on the way. These details were reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is now learned that yesterday morning, Jiang Pingyang, the head of the ninth district, filed a report with the Shanghai Local Court with the young woman Xu Xiuzhen, requesting an autopsy. According to Xu Xiuzhen, a native of Zhenjiang, 22 years old, residing at No. 7 Lanxinli, Bair Road, she and the deceased Cheng Cuiying were close friends. Recently, because Cuiying intended to go to Xiaodongmen to buy foreign cloth, she had come to my house several times and asked me to accompany her. Because my newborn baby was only two months old and had been unwell recently, my mother repeatedly refused to let me go with her. Cuiying left unhappily upon hearing this. Yesterday morning at 11 a.m., Cuiying came to my house again and invited me to go buy cloth together. Because my mother had repeatedly prevented me and the child was slightly better, I held the child and went out with her. Initially, we intended to go to Xiaodongmen to buy foreign cloth, but when we reached the east end of the City God Temple, Cuiying suddenly said she would buy it another day, so we turned back west. When we reached the entrance of the City God Temple, Cuiying invited me to eat sweet fermented rice balls inside the gate. Because it was almost noon, I thought this kind of waste could be saved, and Cuiying agreed, so we walked home slowly, talking as we went. When we reached the west end of Chenshi'an Bridge, robbers suddenly caught up and robbed Cuiying's gold bracelet (two silk strands, worth eighty yuan). Cuiying refused to let go and struggled with them. Suddenly, I heard a gunshot from behind. I immediately told Cuiying to let go, but she stubbornly grabbed one of the robbers and refused to release him. Just as things were at a critical moment, I heard another gunshot, and I saw Cuiying fall to the ground. The bullet grazed my ear. At first, I didn't realize Cuiying was injured, so I went forward to help her up. In an instant, I saw blood flowing from Cuiying's forehead, and she was unconscious. I was shocked and quickly hired a car with the two children (one was Cuiying's two-year-old child, Ailin) and went home to report. I was also almost involved, etc. In the afternoon, Prosecutor Li Fen, commissioned by the court, came with Examiner Xuan Zhiming to the court. It was confirmed that the deceased Cheng Cuiying died from a bullet penetrating her brain. It was decided that the family would collect the body and wait for the arrest and punishment of the murderer.</p>

<p>Wang Shanlu, a native of Ningbo who lives in Yongxinli, Geller Road, French Concession, and works as a cigarette peddler, married Wang Renjuan (28 years old this year), the daughter of his fellow villager Wang Jinzhang, through a matchmaker. After the marriage, the couple loved each other dearly and had a son who is now eight years old. Recently, Wang Renjuan, unable to bear her husband's abuse, left home with her son and filed a petition with the Civil Mediation Office of the Second Special Court, requesting mediation and divorce from her husband, Wang Shanlu. The court accepted the petition, and yesterday morning at around 10 a.m., Judge Li Liang specially opened Civil Court No. 7 for mediation. Both parties were summoned to court. First, the petitioner Wang Renjuan testified about the unbearable pain of cohabiting with her abusive husband and requested permission to divorce. When questioned, the opposing party Wang Shanlu testified that his wife went out on the fifth of this month and could not be found anywhere. He had reported it to the police and opposed the divorce, requesting that the petitioner be ordered to return home and live together. After examining the testimony, the court declared the mediation unsuccessful and ordered the petitioner to file a formal lawsuit separately, and ordered the two parties to go out and reconcile themselves, and then adjourned the court. When the two parties left the court, several male and female relatives of the man blocked the woman's way and ordered her to go home. Wang resolutely opposed and refused to go back. While the two sides were arguing, three or four young women on the woman's side hired a car and came to help, forcibly trying to take Wang away in the car. At this point, Wang Shanlu believed that these four women, whom he did not know, should not deliberately obstruct the reconciliation of the couple while their family was experiencing sorrow, and he could not help but be angry and stepped forward to question them. Wang's friends also helped to hold the three women. While they were arguing, the police arrived and took both parties to the Central Police Station. After questioning by the head of the police station, the case was dismissed as a family dispute. Wang walked out of the police station and, seeing that the road was full of her husband's relatives, fearing that she would be surrounded again, she ran to the Second Court's bailiff room to take refuge. After Judge Li, who was handling the case, learned about it, he reopened the court and ordered the bailiff to summon both parties to the case for questioning. What are you arguing about outside? Wang tearfully testified that she did not want to go home now and that they had forcibly blocked her. She was working as a hired hand at the Old Garbage Bridge and had a fixed address, so why must they force her to go home? The official then painstakingly persuaded both parties that reconciliation outside the court was advisable and summoned Wang Renjuan's father, Wang Gangzhang, to the court, ordering Wang to return home with her husband. If they wanted to beat her, the law would protect her, and they would certainly not make things difficult for her in the same way. He then ordered Wang Shanlu's side to wait for a moment and ordered Wang to leave the court with her father first and go home with peace of mind. About a quarter of an hour later, Wang Shanlu was ordered to leave the court and return home. A humorous scene of forcibly pulling and entanglement arising from a divorce case came to an end.</p>
<h3 id="e132">Yong'an Silver Company Case: Several Households Have Reached a Settlement; Luo Meifang Acquitted After Interrogation; Lin Kanghou Again Fails to Attend Meeting <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>The Yong'an Silver Company, which has been bankrupt for half a year, has not yet found a way to pay off its debts, leading to accusations of fraud and embezzlement against the company's directors, general manager, deputy manager, Deng Jing, Li Du, Wang Jiazhen, Mo Dehui, Lin Kanghou, Qian Youju, Ye Hanshui, Zhang Zilian, Peng Baohui, Lin Qiuhu, Gu Chuntao, Jiang Qi, Dai Kechang, Ou Jiancheng, Shen Zufu, Wang Shuixin, Luo Huafang, and other seventeen people. The number of lawsuits has increased to thirteen. Of the defendants, only Ou and Luo had previously been summoned to court, and Ou was ordered to pay 30,000 yuan and Luo 5,000 yuan as bail pending trial, as reported in the newspaper. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Wu Zehan opened the court for further trial. Only one defendant, Luo Huafang, and his defense lawyer, Chen Tingrui, reported to the court. The rest failed to attend despite being summoned. Ou Jiancheng's defense lawyer, Li Shirui, gave a detailed report on the recent situation of negotiation and settlement between the two parties regarding the valuation of debts, requesting a further postponement, and stated that the valuation of the four households including Peng Zican and the Li Liangbin household had been settled out of court. The plaintiff's lawyers in the two cases then requested to withdraw the lawsuits, and the court approved the request. Other plaintiffs requested to withdraw the portion of the lawsuit against Lin Kanghou, and some requested to withdraw the portions of the lawsuit against Mo Dehui and Jiang Qi. The court approved these requests separately. However, lawyer Chen Tingrui requested that the portion of the lawsuit against Luo Huafang be tried first, stating that Luo only served as deputy manager after the company resumed business, and the cases filed by the plaintiffs had nothing to do with Luo. However, Luo still attended every hearing and was ordered to pay bail, which was very painful if prolonged. Therefore, he requested that all cases with Luo's name as a defendant be investigated first. Lin Kanghou's lawyer still stated that Lin was unable to attend due to attending a meeting. Judge Wu then declared that there were currently thirteen lawsuits against Yong'an for unpaid debts. Except for the self-accusers who requested a full withdrawal of their lawsuit, there were still nine cases. Of these, only the lawsuit filed by Chen Shengyao and other five households listed the defendant Luo Huafang's name. After questioning the self-accuser Feng Shunji and others in the newly filed lawsuit about the facts of the accusation, the relationship between Luo and the lawsuit would be studied, and Lin Kanghou's lawyer would be told that Lin Kanghou's excuse of attending a meeting every time he was summoned was an intentional evasion, and that if he failed to attend again, he would be dealt with according to the law. After the declaration, the nature of the debts owed to Feng Shunji was investigated. Lawyer Li stated that the money handed over to the company by Feng was a deposit, which was different from other deposits, and that he still owed the company debts and had now filed a lawsuit against Feng, and that it was still difficult to determine who the creditor was. Judge Wu then inquired of Luo Huafang and determined that Luo had no suspicion of embezzlement or fraud and had no relationship with the deposits of Chen Shengyao and others, and immediately announced that Luo Huafang was found not guilty. The remaining cases were adjourned for further trial.</p>

Afterwards, the owner of the property requested compensation for the loss from the Municipal Council. It is now heard that the Municipal Council has rejected the request, because the land on which the advertising billboard was built belongs to private property and not a highway, so the Municipal Council cannot be responsible for this matter.</p>

<p>All the tenants on Dajing Road in Jiumudi had been forced by their landlords to increase their rent by 30% for several months. This was investigated and learned by the Nanqu Rent Reduction Association, which believed that in the current depressed market situation, the landlords on that road should not increase the rent under any pretext. Therefore, representatives Ding Zhaorong, Qiu Bangzhen, and Zhang Yongyi filed a lawsuit with the Shanghai Local Court in their joint names and negotiated, demanding that the increase be cancelled. After the court inquired about it once, it finally ruled that the landlords lacked reasons for increasing the rent, so the 30% increase was immediately cancelled. After the beneficiaries of all the shops and residents on Dajing Road held a plaque with the four characters "Wei Min Zao Fu (Benefitting the People)" jointly presented to the association, a military band was sent to the association the day before yesterday to welcome the representatives of the association's sub-districts to the meeting.

<p>Good News for Sufferers of Stomach Ailments: Chinese people are fond of eating, and the frequency of banquets and social gatherings surpasses that of almost all countries in the world. Therefore, the number of people suffering from stomach ailments is also exceptionally high. However, most people regard it as a very minor ailment and do not pay enough attention to it. Little do they know that if it is not treated early, it can easily lead to serious conditions such as stomach cancer, endangering life. The Swiss trading company "Sin Sui Kang" at 131 Mingyuan Road in this city has recently managed a kind of stomach medicine called "Alucol". This medicine is very effective in treating conditions such as excessive stomach acid, excessive gastric secretion, and stomach ulcers, far surpassing similar products on the market. In the past, the most common ingredient in stomach medicine was baking soda. This medicine neutralizes acidity, but it can cause hydrochloric acid deficiency, which eliminates the antiseptic effect, resulting in the production of many decaying substances in the stomach. Furthermore, taking baking soda causes many uncomfortable pains, such as burning sensations, heavy pressure, stuffiness, and aches. However, the effect of Alucol is completely different. It does not completely neutralize stomach acid, but instead combines with it to form a gel-like solution, while the physiological acidity remains unchanged. Therefore, anyone who experiences side effects from taking baking soda or cannot tolerate baking soda should use Alucol. This medicine is very easy to digest and convenient to take. No matter what kind of stomach ailment is being treated, it can prevent the ailment from recurring. It is truly an essential item for every household. This medicine is packaged in bottles of sixty tablets each and is sold in major pharmacies. Those with stomach ailments should try it.</p>

<h3 id="e156">Siam Intensifies the Destruction of Overseas Chinese Education: Newly Issued Mandatory Class Schedules and Orders for Chinese Schools to Re-register; Plans to Merge All Chinese Schools and Force School-Age Overseas Chinese Children to Attend <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>(Bangkok Airmail) The Siamese government is implementing a policy of assimilation towards overseas Chinese. It has scheduled the abolition of mandatory classes in Chinese schools on April 1st of this year, ordering overseas Chinese children to attend Siamese schools to receive their assimilation education. Details have been provided in previous communications. Since this event, the overseas Chinese in Siam have generally recognized that the Siamese government's policy of assimilating our overseas Chinese is poisonous and must be opposed to the death. Therefore, they have both telegraphed the central government, requesting active negotiations, and sent representatives back to the country to present their case and urge action. At the same time, they are seeking local solutions, requesting the Siamese authorities to temporarily maintain the status quo while our government formally negotiates with Siam, cancels all previous harsh regulations, and preserves the freedom of our overseas Chinese education. Simultaneously, compatriots in the country have also risen to support them. The Guangdong Miscellaneous Grain Adjustment Committee has even proposed banning the import of Siamese rice to prompt the Siamese side to realize the situation. This news reached Siam at the end of March, causing a brief period of panic among the Siamese authorities. The State Council immediately resolved to withdraw the order to abolish mandatory classes in Chinese schools. However, at that time, only a phone call was made to Mr. Ma Liqun, the acting chairman of the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce (the chairman, Chen Shouming, is currently on leave from Siam), and no formal order was delivered. Subsequently, due to the Education Minister, Phraya Phison Saraphaphan, being strong and unwilling to withdraw the order (the previous order to abolish mandatory classes in Chinese schools was issued by the Ministry of Education), and because the news of our country banning Siamese rice was only a flash in the pan for the authorities and was not actually implemented, the matter of withdrawing the order was shelved. A few days later, the Ministry of Education publicly announced newly revised mandatory class schedules, with 23 hours of Siamese language per week, increasing the school hours by one hour and forty-five minutes, while the time for Chinese language was not included in the curriculum. It also ordered all schools that wanted to run mandatory classes to re-register, and only those approved by the Ministry of Education would be allowed to enroll students of mandatory age. Thus, the power of deprivation still rests with the Ministry of Education. The newly revised curriculum for private schools (referring to Chinese schools) running mandatory classes is listed below:</p>
<p>Grade 1 Grade 2 Grade 3 Grade 4 Grade 5</p>
<p>Moral Education 1.00 1.30 1.00 1.00 1.00</p>
<p>Siamese 12.30 11.00 10.00 8.00 3.00</p>
<p>Arithmetic 5.00 5.00 4.00 3.00 2.00</p>
<p>General Knowledge 2.30 3.30 5.00 7.00 10.00</p>
<p>Hygiene 1.00 1.00 1.00 1.00 1.00</p>
<p>Drawing 1.00 1.00</p>
<p>Scouting 1.00 1.00 1.00 1.00 1.00</p>
<p>Crafts or Commerce 1.00 1.00 1.00 (Note: The above curriculum requires 23 hours of instruction per week, all of which must be taught in Siamese.) Since the announcement of the newly revised curriculum, all Chinese schools have recognized that the Ministry of Education's policy is a retreat in disguise. Nominally, it allows Chinese schools to continue running mandatory classes, but in reality, it increases the time for Siamese language and restricts Chinese schools from freely operating. Therefore, representatives of these mandatory classes have repeatedly visited the Education Minister to request a flexible solution. However, the Education Minister's attitude is strong and unyielding, with no room for compromise. Finally, he explicitly stated to the authorities of the Chinese schools that the Chinese schools must merge and no longer be established separately as before. After the merger, if they can be affiliated with the Ministry of Education and operate in accordance with the educational goals and national policies of the Siamese government, the Ministry of Education will provide the schools with economic subsidies. The representatives and principals of the Chinese schools, knowing the intention behind this statement, expressed their agreement on the spot. Afterwards, because it was during the vacation period, re-registration was not carried out. The Siamese government then took the opportunity to implement the second step of its strategy, issuing a notice through the county offices, ordering children subject to mandatory education to attend nearby Siamese schools starting May 1st, because Chinese schools have not yet re-registered with the Ministry of Education to become mandatory schools and therefore have no right to enroll students of mandatory age. Currently, the authorities of the Chinese schools and parents are hoping that our government will actively take effective measures to protest to the Siamese side, cancel all harsh regulations. If there is any further delay, all overseas Chinese children will be forced to attend Siamese schools and receive their assimilation education. As a reporter looking north, I implore the authorities and compatriots across the country on behalf of the three million overseas Chinese to lend a helping hand quickly.</p>
<h3 id="e157">Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Funds: Subsidizing Education Expenses, a Total of 1.33 Million Yuan <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 14th) The board of directors of the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Fund has thoroughly reviewed the subsidy funds for educational and cultural undertakings for the 24th year through the Education Committee. A distribution method was drafted and reported to the board of directors meeting held on the 13th, which was unanimously approved. According to the person in charge of the board, a total of 80 cases of requests for funds were received this year, combined with 23 cases from the previous year's first distribution of interest, which were decided to be considered this year, totaling 103 cases. The total amount requested reached over 24 million yuan. The income from interest this year, which can be used to subsidize the next year, was estimated at only about 857,000 yuan during the third joint meeting of the Boxer Indemnity Fund organizations in January, according to the borrowing contracts and the stipulated interest payment methods. Fortunately, in recent months, new loan items have been allocated, and interest has been deducted in advance. According to the material purchase reports sent by the London Purchasing Committee and the settlement letters from various borrowing organizations, it is estimated that we can still receive over 400,000 yuan in May and June. It was decided to raise a total of 1,336,500 yuan, no matter what. However, the subsidies for various undertakings determined in the first distribution last year almost all need to be continuously allocated this year, so there is still no way to cope with the new requests for funds this year. Therefore, after discussion, it was decided to follow the original method, using the integer of 1.2 million yuan to distribute to various types of undertakings according to the stipulated proportion, and using the remaining 136,000 yuan to continue to handle the special rural education of category E. The distribution of the entire case is as follows: Category A, according to the stipulated proportion of 25 percent, this category can obtain 300,000 yuan. According to the original plan decided last year, it will still be evenly distributed to the National Central Museum and the National Central Library as construction funds. Category B, according to the stipulated proportion of 35 percent, this category can obtain 420,000 yuan. According to the original plan decided last year, 380,000 yuan will be given priority to subsidize the following undertakings that should continue to be subsidized: (1) Lecture fees for Central University, Sun Yat-sen University, Wuhan University, Zhejiang University, Beiyang Institute of Technology, and the Central Hygiene Experiment Center, totaling 60,000 yuan. (2) Manufacturing scientific instruments and equipment fees for the Central Research Institute, totaling 30,000 yuan. (3) Equipment fees for the Physics and Chemistry Research Institutes of the Peking Research Institute, totaling 30,000 yuan. (4) Equipment fees for Sun Yat-sen University, totaling 40,000 yuan. (5) Construction fees for the School of Engineering of Wuhan University, totaling 40,000 yuan. (6) Equipment fees for the Schools of Agriculture, Engineering, and Science of Zhejiang University, totaling 40,000 yuan. (7) Equipment fees for the Department of Mathematics of Nankai University, totaling 20,000 yuan. (8) Equipment fees for Yenching University, totaling 15,000 yuan. (9) Scientific book purchase fees for Xiamen University, totaling 10,000 yuan. (10) Construction fees for Shanghai Medical College, totaling 20,000 yuan. (11) Equipment fees for Xiangya Medical College, totaling 20,000 yuan. (12) Equipment fees for the Central Hygiene Experiment Center, totaling 20,000 yuan. (13) Construction fees for the National Compilation and Translation Bureau, totaling 25,000 yuan. (14) Compilation of illustrated books by the Society for Research in Chinese Architecture, totaling 100,000 yuan. In addition, there is a remaining 40,000 yuan to subsidize the following schools: (1) Equipment fees for Liaoning Medical College, totaling 20,000 yuan. (2) Fees for Hai Medical University to add physical and chemical instruments and reagents, totaling 10,000 yuan. (3) Equipment fees for the mining and metallurgical laboratory of Guangxi University, totaling 10,000 yuan. Category C, the public expense for 59 students studying in the UK next year, and the expenses for the third public expense students to go abroad, totaling over 232,000 yuan. According to the stipulated proportion of 15 percent, this category can obtain 180,000 yuan, and the difference is about 50,000 yuan, which will be temporarily borrowed. Category D, according to the stipulated proportion of 1 percent, this category can obtain 12,000 yuan, which is intended to set up two types of bonuses to solicit the following textbooks: (1) Junior high school history textbook bonus of 6,000 yuan. (2) Junior high school geography textbook bonus of 6,000 yuan. Category E, according to the stipulated proportion of 24 percent, this category can obtain 268,000 yuan. According to the original plan decided last year, all the special rural education expenses in the recovered bandit areas of Jiangxi Province, which should continue to be subsidized, will still be borrowed and allocated in full, as in the previous year, with a special reserve of 136,500 yuan. The remaining 26,3500 yuan will be allocated from the amount that this unit can obtain. The remaining 24,500 yuan in this category will be used to subsidize the following educational undertakings: (1) Subsidizing the construction of a midwifery school in Xijing, Shaanxi Province, totaling 10,000 yuan. (2) Subsidizing the construction of a Mongolian and Tibetan elementary school in Qinghai Province, totaling 14,500 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e158">Ministry of Education Clarifies Doubts Regarding the Graduation Examination Regulations for Middle School and Normal School Students <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education issued a notice to the education departments and bureaus of various provinces and cities on the 13th, stating: "According to the request from the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education to interpret doubts regarding the graduation examination regulations for middle school and normal school students, the following explanations are provided: (1) For junior high school students who have not undergone the joint examination or spot check and still take the graduation examination held by the school, their graduation certificates will only be stamped and state that 'Approved by the Ministry of Education to be exempted from the joint examination, and passed the school examination with passing grades.'</p>
<p>(2) Students who fail one or two subjects in the graduation joint examination are allowed to participate in the joint examination for those subjects twice in the next two sessions. That is, they have a total of three opportunities to take the exam, and it should not be difficult to pass. If they still fail, if they are directly required to repeat the grade in accordance with the rule for failing three or more subjects, it will cause those who have already applied for further education to drop out midway and re-enter junior high school or senior high school, creating various difficulties. If they are directly issued a certificate of completion in accordance with the method for those who cannot repeat the grade for certain reasons, it will also cause those who have already gone on to further education to lose their student status. If they are allowed to participate in the joint examination for the failed subjects indefinitely, it will also be unreasonable. The compromise solution is to hold a full examination, which still implies relief within the restrictions.</p>
<p>(3) If a student is absent from the joint examination due to a legitimate reason, the lack of grades for the missing subject is no different from failing one or two subjects in the joint examination. Therefore, they are also allowed to continue to participate in the joint examination twice in the next two sessions to avoid disputes and ensure uniformity. Since the missing subject is considered a failure and must be retaken, there is no need to use the usual grades as the grade for that subject. As for the absence from all subjects due to a legitimate reason, it is different from failing three or more subjects in the joint examination. There is no need to repeat the grade and they are allowed to continue to participate in the joint examination twice in the next two sessions, but such students are allowed to repeat the grade if they wish.</p>
<p>(4) Allowing students who fail one or two subjects in the joint examination to apply for further education in advance is to provide convenience for those going on to further education. However, only after they have passed all the subjects in the joint examination and obtained a junior high school or senior high school graduation certificate can they participate in the graduation examination of the school they have entered. This emphasizes the foundation of academic studies and strictly regulates admission qualifications. It is impossible to relax the rules later because of the leniency given earlier. In fact, if the grades in the years after entering further education are all passing, the subjects that fail in one or two subjects will not fail three times in a row. If they still fail, they can only participate in the joint examination for all subjects. If the study period in the school they have entered has expired and the grades over the years are all passing, then the graduation examination of the student in that school can be retained, and they can participate in the graduation examination of that school after obtaining the qualification for junior high school or senior high school graduation.</p>
<p>(5) The certificate of passing the graduation joint examination and the certificate of applying for further education should both have the student's photo affixed and stamped with the seal of the competent educational administrative authority. After the graduation certificate is issued or they go on to further education, they should be revoked as planned. In addition to the separate orders, the above explanations are hereby recorded and a copy of the original submission from the Jiangsu Education Department is attached for your information." This order includes a copy of the original submission from the Jiangsu Education Department requesting an explanation of the doubts regarding the graduation joint examination regulations for middle school and normal school students.</p>
<p>Copy of the original submission: Received the instructions from your ministry, No. 4266, to abolish the school graduation examination for middle schools and normal schools, and to issue revised graduation joint examination regulations for middle school and normal school students, which should be followed. After carefully examining the revised regulations, there are still several doubts that need to be clarified:</p>
<p>1. Article 9 of the Revised Middle School Graduation Joint Examination Regulations stipulates that all subjects in the graduation joint examination must be passed before graduation, and the graduation certificate will be issued by the school after being stamped by the educational administrative organs of the provinces and cities and affixed with the graduation joint examination mark. Students who pass the joint examination or spot check have no problem, but for junior high school students who have not undergone the spot check and still take the graduation examination held by the school, it seems inappropriate to affix the same mark if the graduation certificate is also affixed with the mark, otherwise there is an obvious distinction. How should this be handled? This is the first point that needs to be clarified.</p>
<p>2. Article 11 of the Revised Middle School and Normal School Graduation Joint Examination Regulations stipulates that students who fail one or two subjects in the joint examination are allowed to continue to participate in the joint examination for those subjects twice in the next two sessions before they can graduate. If they still fail in any subject, they should take the joint examination for all subjects. The original intention of the legislation was to allow students who fail one or two subjects to continue to participate in the joint examination for those subjects twice in the next two sessions, precisely to give them a chance to succeed. However, if there are still subjects that fail, it is not appropriate to deny the recognition of all the subjects that have already been passed and to retake all the examinations. This is not only too strict, but also difficult to implement in practice. It seems that the method in Article 10 should be followed. If there are still subjects that fail in the second joint examination, the original school should issue a certificate of completion, stating the grades of all subjects in the graduation joint examination, and affixing a mark indicating that a certain subject in the graduation joint examination failed twice. This is the second point that needs to be clarified. 3. Article 11, paragraph 2, of the Revised Middle School and Normal School Graduation Joint Examination Regulations stipulates that those who are unable to take all or part of the required subjects in the joint examination due to certain reasons will have their missing subjects marked as failing. This is also to prevent students from temporarily evading the examination and to strictly limit it. However, some participating students may have asked for leave in advance due to illness or important matters, and will participate in the joint examination in the next session. Others may have suddenly become ill during the examination, or may not be able to attend the examination for one or more subjects. These students should not be treated as failing in all cases. The circumstances should be considered, the facts should be investigated, and they should be allowed to take a makeup examination in the next session. Those who fail to take the examination without a valid reason or violate the rules of the examination hall should be marked as failing. In addition, if a missing subject is marked as failing, the grade is of course invalid. Should the usual grade, i.e. one-fourth, be used as the grade for that subject? If all subjects are missing and marked as failing, should they be made to repeat the grade, or is it unnecessary to repeat the grade, and they are allowed to participate in the joint examination in the next session? This is the third point that needs to be clarified.</p>
<p>4. Article 12 of the Revised Middle School Graduation Joint Examination Regulations stipulates that students who fail one or more subjects in the joint examination are allowed to apply for further education in advance. If they are admitted, they will be treated as probationary students, and only after they have passed the joint examination for those subjects and obtained a graduation certificate can they participate in the graduation examination of the school they have entered. This restriction will inevitably cause difficulties in the future when the students are handling graduation at the schools they have entered. For example, if the students participate in the joint examination for those subjects twice and still have failing subjects, but their grades in the school they have entered are all passing over the years, it seems inappropriate to cancel their graduation examination for this reason, as it does not encourage students to make progress and has a great impact that cannot be ignored. This is the fourth point that needs to be clarified.</p>
<p>5. Article 14 of the Revised Middle School and Normal School Graduation Joint Examination Regulations stipulates that students who pass the joint examination will first be issued a certificate of passing the graduation joint examination, and Article 11 of the Middle School Joint Examination Regulations stipulates that students who fail one or two subjects will be issued a certificate of applying for further education. This is to facilitate students' further education and service. However, in addition to the certificate, a graduation certificate must still be issued in the future. To prevent abuses, it seems that when the graduation certificate is issued, the original school should be held responsible for recovering the certificate of passing and submitting it to the competent educational administrative authority for cancellation. The certificate of applying for further education should be recovered by the school they have entered and submitted to the original issuing competent educational administrative authority for cancellation to prevent others from impersonating them. Furthermore, the certificate of applying for further education can only be used as proof of applying for further education and cannot be used for other purposes. This is the fifth point that needs to be clarified. The above points concern the ambiguities of the articles. Therefore, this document is submitted to request your review and prompt instructions. Respectfully presented to Wang, Minister of Education, Zhou Fohai, Director of the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education, April 18, 24th year.

<h3 id="e159">Excellent Chinese Engineering Students Returning from Internships in London: The Industrial Federation and the China Association Host a Banquet <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>(London, Havana, 13th) The Industrial Federation and the China Association jointly sponsored excellent Chinese engineering students for an internship of one and a half years in British factories. The first batch of two students, namely Zhu Changye (transliteration), who interned in electrical engineering, and Zhang Haitao (transliteration), who interned in locomotive manufacturing, have completed their terms and are about to return to the country to serve. The Industrial Federation and the China Association recently hosted a banquet to bid them farewell. Lieutenant General McDonough, Chairman, delivered a speech, saying, "Chinese students coming here for internships may not see immediate results, but it is hoped that after they learn the British modern mechanical standards and methods, they will return to the country to serve. With their reputation growing day by day, it will increase the opportunity for British industry to participate in China's economic development." The second batch of six Chinese internship students arrived in England last month, and three more will come here in June of this year. From 1934 to 1935, there were a total of sixteen people, which is far from the number desired by British factories.</p>

<h3 id="e161">Zhang Yuanruo Lectures at Tongji University: Self-Reliance and Diligent Service <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>The Affiliated Senior Vocational School of Tongji University in Jiangwan yesterday invited Zhang Yuanruo to give a lecture entitled "Self-Reliance and Diligent Service." Mr. Zhang elaborated in detail on his recently created self-reliance doctrine, extensively citing historical facts from China and abroad, and drawing on the theories of various scholars. His words were insightful and inspiring. He briefly stated that self-reliance is the antithesis of liberalism, and must be based on obligations and responsibilities, aimed at society and the country, and seeking the completion of self-personality. Therefore, the worldview of self-reliance advocates should be based on labor service as the goal. This also has its basis in philosophy. All the wise emperors and virtuous ministers of the past who were able to achieve great things for the country had this spirit. Extending this to the survival of the universe, the life of the nation, the evolution of society, and the development of culture, all are due to labor service. China's past education was decadent and nihilistic, the national spirit was weak and demoralized, real talents and practical learning were not developed, and the inherent cultural creative ability of the Chinese nation gradually disappeared, leading to national poverty, economic decline, and national decline to this extreme. Therefore, the most practical way to save the country today is to first base it on the principle of self-reliance, to inspire the national enthusiasm and vitality for saving and building the country, and those in power should also take the spirit of diligence and national revival of Dayu and the Duke of Zhou as an example for the people, encouraging each other from top to bottom, and working hard throughout the country, so that there is hope for revival. The reason why European countries were able to break free from their medieval dark ages and have today's civilization and prosperity is also due to the awakening of their national self and the efforts of their national self. This is a successful precedent of self-reliance, and it is also the most powerful factual explanation of self-reliance.</p>

<p>The Joint Sports Games of Independent Colleges has been established for more than a year, and the results of previous competitions have been quite satisfactory. The founding school of the association, the National Shanghai Business School, has presided over the conference affairs in the past, with excellent results and complete spirit, which has been praised by all walks of life. It is now learned that the school has withdrawn for some reason and formally sent a letter to the association yesterday to declare the withdrawal. It is found that a total of eight colleges participated in the association last semester, and a total of four colleges, including Shanghai College of Political Science and Law, Tongde Medical College, Mongolia-Tibet College, and Business School, have withdrawn one after another this semester, which is a major loss for the association.</p>

<p>— (Microorganism)</p>
<p>Ink, everyone knows it's black. There's an old saying, "One who stays near vermilion gets stained red, and one who stays near ink gets stained black." The red ink and blue ink used in schools clearly don't have a trace of black in them. I wonder where the ink is in them?</p>
<p>The towels used in bathhouses don't distinguish between top and bottom. The bathhouse attendant sometimes "wipes people's feet and buttocks," and sometimes "wipes people's hands and faces." It's just like people drinking wine only waiting for the wine to taste as sweet as honey in their mouths. They argue endlessly without considering the winemakers who at that time, with their bare black feet, climbed into the vat to "tread the yeast and mash," with "foot dirt" mixed in. This is probably holding on to the philosophy of "what the eye doesn't see, the heart doesn't grieve"!</p>
<p>The thing for brushing teeth is called a toothbrush, because it can brush away the dirt on the teeth. A scrubbing brush is used for brushing clothes. Logically, it should be called a "clothes brush," but it's called a scrubbing brush. Does that mean "clothes are wooden boards"?</p>
<h3 id="e174">Vinegar <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>— Lan Shan</p>
<p>Opening the door to seven things, "vinegar" is also one of them. When women sometimes crave sourness, use a little vinegar to prepare dishes, or buy some sour plums or pickled vegetables to eat as snacks, it's a sign of pregnancy. The whole family is overjoyed, playfully joking with her.</p>
<p>Hangzhou restaurants' vinegar-braised fish is well-known and popular, entirely dependent on the head of vinegar.</p>
<p>Women usually like to eat vinegar, the reason being, of course, for that sour taste, eating it brings a subtle feeling that can stimulate the stomach. So, people with stomach problems shouldn't eat sour and spicy foods. Not only do they eat vinegar, but at certain times, they are also skilled at making vinegar, capable of producing a very qualified product without the guidance of a vinegar master, that sour taste is enough to thoroughly fumigate their husbands. If Mr. So-and-so has a few encounters with Ms. So-and-so, and his wife sees it, she gets very angry. In this way, her raw material for making vinegar is also available, and she often uses those sour words to stimulate him. If he is willing to change his ways, that's all right. If he repeatedly refuses to reform, she overturns the vinegar vat and engages in a great battle with him. As a result, her acid reaction is often more powerful than a force of victory, easily conquering him!</p>
<p>Between husband and wife, sweetness is the principle. But going sweet all the way through is too cloying. Where is the excitement? Like side dishes, chicken, goose, fish, and meat are highly valued, but eating them for a long time gets tiring, and you have to change the pattern and change the taste. It's the same with husband and wife. Sometimes a little sour thing happens, adjusting each other's feelings and stimulating each other's appetite. This is harmless in general, as long as it's done in moderation, and not in excessive amounts. Otherwise, too much stimulation can lead to unfortunate accidents, turning it over, just like eating too much vinegar will cause nausea.</p>
<p>"Miscellaneous Records from the Garden of Leisure" has an interesting story about vinegar: "When Zhang Muan, the provincial administrator of Haifeng, went out one day, an old woman stopped his carriage to complain, saying that her husband had married a concubine and asked him to prohibit it. Zhang Gong laughed and sent her away, saying: 'I am an official who sells salt, and I don't care about people eating vinegar.'" Reading it can make you laugh out loud.</p>
<h3 id="e175">Old Man Yongchun <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Qing</p>
<p>Old Woman Yongchun asked me to read a letter. As I read aloud the letter her son had sent, her two hollow eye sockets became somewhat watery. However, I was not moved in the slightest, as I was reminded of an ordinary man.</p>
<p>Old Man Yongchun was a quiet person who disliked activity, hence his face was stern and unchanging every day. Anyone who knew him, or had even seen him once, would say he had the look of a lonely old man.</p>
<p>He was the head of our clan, and I never heard anyone call him by his given name. Especially us younger members of the clan, we were obliged to call him "Grandpa," and seeing him was like a chick encountering a hawk, causing us to tremble with fear.</p>
<p>Every morning, he would get out of bed at the crack of dawn, and *duk, duk!* with a rhythmic beat, he would tap the floorboards with his long-stemmed pipe, which had become vermilion from sucking on it. The shop assistants sleeping in the store would hear his signal to get up, and they would hurriedly roll up their bedding.</p>
<p>Once the door panels were removed, the people of the town gradually gathered! The noise of voices grew clamorous! The broker strained his hoarse throat, shouting out the weight and market price of goods, busier than a broker in the stock exchange! Old Man Yongchun, as usual, would go to Ma Pingsheng's tea house at the east end of town for morning tea. He always brought his own small packet of "Yu Qian" (pre-Qingming tea). No one could stomach his tea, as it was even more bitter than medicine, but he would even chew the tea leaves and swallow them. When the market closed, he would bid farewell to his purple clay teapot with the coiled dragon design.</p>
<p>The reason I can still remember Old Man Yongchun is entirely due to the impression his moss-covered cakes left on me.</p>

<p>— Originally written by Princess Der Ling of Qing, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>"Form a circle!" After all the dogs had come out, he shouted this again; the dogs, upon hearing, all started running in circles in the open space in front, constantly barking, and their bright red tongues darted in and out. Several of the larger dogs even started doing somersaults on the spot, like a troop of mischievous elementary school students causing a ruckus on the playground. It looked truly innocent and lovely! Then, the eunuch shouted:</p>
<p>"Stop!" His shout was as effective as a command in the army. The dogs, upon hearing it, immediately calmed down and lined up in an orderly row, forming a line facing the row of attendants behind the Empress Dowager. Perhaps they stood even more orderly than we did! Their eyes were round and protruding, like two black chess pieces; at this moment, they were all staring at the Empress Dowager, staring without blinking, fully expressing the cleverness of trained domestic animals. However, if we only took a cursory glance, it would be difficult to see their eyes, because the tufts of hair on their heads were particularly long, so long that they covered their eyes. Only when the sunlight shone directly on their foreheads could we see those two lights, like small electric lights, flashing in the darkness. As for whether they had any difficulty seeing things, I cannot know.</p>
<p>By the time all the dogs had lined up in a straight line and were standing still, no longer jumping around, and their barking had also stopped, because their barking was not indiscriminate, the eunuch in charge of the dogs could make them bark when he wanted them to bark, and stop barking when he wanted them to stop.

<p>Biographical Sketches</p>
<h3 id="e178">Notes on Gao Zhifang (Part 2) <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>— Zhen Lü</p>
<p>He had participated in several long-distance races organized by the city government. Once, in a 20,000-meter race, he finished fifth out of nearly a hundred athletes, receiving some prizes from the authorities and a glorious record in the newspapers—the name Gao Zhifang briefly appeared in the sports world. Because I didn't know that this was A-Gen's name, I didn't pay attention. (He presented several old newspapers and medals he had kept as proof.) Although this did not help his difficult livelihood, and in fact consumed many days of earning money for preparation and practice, he himself was very satisfied.</p>
<p>Last year, he was admitted to the Shanghai Municipal Police Training Class, with Mr. Jiang Huaizhen acting as his guarantor. As usual, he studied for six months and graduated eighth out of over two hundred people, then was assigned to a police position in the Public Security Bureau, serving in the Sun Temple area of Zhabei. Relying on his conscience, based on what he had learned, he fulfilled his duties, but was envied by the local thugs and subjected to dishonorable accusations, almost leading to his dismissal. If it weren't for dozens of formal merchants jointly guaranteeing his character, even though the thugs eventually received a few months of detention by the court, he did not dare to compromise with the evil forces and secure his position, but still had to "go his own way," as he put it.</p>
<p>As for his motivation for joining the police force, it can also be explained. It turned out that one day, he pulled his empty rickshaw to the side of the road to rest, and was carefully counting his earnings when he glanced up and saw a tattered Party flag covering a pile of old utensils next to the gate of a wealthy family. A person, looking like a servant, was standing idly by the gate. He saw this and could no longer suppress his indignation. He walked over and, after confirming that the utensils belonged to the family, told the person that this was the hard-won emblem of the late Premier, which should be respected and not used carelessly, and asked him to put it away. The person initially ignored him, then said that he was just a rickshaw puller and not qualified to interfere, scolding him harshly. Seeing that his advice was ineffective, he invited a policeman to come and explained the situation to him, asking him to persuade the person. But the policeman also blamed him for meddling, and even threatened him. He was willing to go to the police station with the policeman and suffer the consequences, and of course he was subjected to minor physical punishments on the way. Fortunately, the officials in the station were wise and reprimanded the policeman. He had always been disgusted by the corruption and abuse of the working class by some policemen, and this incident further incited him, so he was determined to join the police force, hoping to lead by example. Now, he has indeed achieved his initial goal.</p>
<p>I see that this Gao Zhifang, although his knowledge is still shallow, is able to strive and move towards the right path. Therefore, at his sincere request, I write down some words to encourage him to make greater progress, and to show it to the general public of distressed young people.</p>
<h3 id="e179">Late-Night Tea <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>— Xin Ren</p>
<p>In the tea houses near the Wuxi train station, a large group of people go for late-night tea every night. These late-night tea drinkers are mostly those who have disembarked from fourth-class carriages. Most of them are victims of the market slump, leaving the city and returning to their baseless hometowns, hunched over, carrying their bundles of clothes. For the sake of a few cents of savings, braving the crowded fourth-class carriages, and to save a few coins on inn accommodations, they endure a sleepless night at the tea house. A pot of tea for sixteen coppers, three copper coins' worth of melon seeds, and a pungent dry tobacco pipe are their perfect late-night snack. They are just like the pleasure-seeking playboys in nightclubs, trying to while away the dark hours. Although some feel the night is too short, wishing time could grant them a few more moments, others curse the relentless continuation of the night, wishing they could break through the eastern sky and grab the bright sun.</p>
<p>The night continues relentlessly. Who really wants to drink late-night tea? So the late-night tea drinkers begin to yawn, and some inevitably strike up conversations with their neighbors.</p>
<p>"Are you going to Shanghai to work for someone?"</p>
<p>"Yes, the brokers' offices are so crowded that you can't squeeze in. I waited for several days, it's really not working out, so I had to come back."</p>
<p>They watch as the famine in the countryside drives them out, thinking of making a living in the city, but now they are squeezed out by the city. They talk with bitterness, ponder with bitterness, and drink bitter tea.</p>
<p>Most late-night tea drinkers are like this. Although they long for the sun to rise, they are still in darkness even when the sun comes out. Pungent tobacco pipes, bitter tea, and yawns come one after another.</p>

<p>The oars are blocked at Huang Xie Pier,</p>
<p>The setting sun slants by the Flower God Temple.</p>
<p>Every year I've been drunk for three months of spring,</p>
<p>But this year, I have no share in watching the falling flowers.</p>
<p>Long street, short trees, desolate at dusk,</p>
<p>Fireflies flit, busy continuously.</p>
<p>Not like gazing from Broken Bridge,</p>
<p>Drooping willows, disordered water, stars yellow.</p>

<p>Zhiqian looked around; the ground was swept clean, the bedding neatly folded, and there was nothing dirty. So he smiled and said: Beihai, we were just chatting in Mr. Zhou's room, never imagining there was someone here waiting for instructions. Beihai tugged at his collar, pressed his chest twice, then, clasping his books, smiled and entered. Because the corner of the table against which Yueying was pressing a garment was right in the path, Beihai still brushed past Yueying's side as he entered. As he walked past, Yueying turned her body slightly to let him pass. When he passed by, Beihai couldn't help but quickly glance at her face. Clearly, as he passed, the blush on her face seemed to deepen. And her head was lowered even more. Zhiqian looked at them both, then said to Beihai: I don't think we can study today, let's do it tomorrow. Beihai put his books on the table and then quickly moved to sit in a chair against the wall. In his heart, he was thinking, could it be that Mr. Cheng, so upright and generous, has some feelings for this young woman? I absolutely won't leave. That's what he was thinking, but he didn't say anything. Yueying, on the other hand, had another thought. It turned out that this young Mr. Wang came every day without fail. She had been holding the corner of the table, looking outwards. Thinking of this, she slowly turned half her body and quickly glanced at Beihai. Actually, even if she had really turned around and looked at Beihai face to face, Zhiqian wouldn't have minded much. It was just that her thinking about it and not daring to look openly told Zhiqian, who had long experience in the sea of people, that this was an expression of some mutual interest. In his heart, he thought, I'll keep quiet and see what happens with this young couple. (204)</p>

<h3 id="e182">Finance: The U.S. Will Continue Silver Purchases; Spot Gold Plummets Ten Dollars; Sentiment Uncertain, Strong at First, Then Weak; Indian Silver Rises Only Slightly, Finally Still Stable <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>The gold market initially reacted yesterday to overseas news of a continued silver purchase policy, triggering a strong upsurge and breaking into the 80-dollar range. The price drop was severe. Large traders tended to cover short positions. Indian silver rose only slightly and remained stable after the low point. In the morning, overseas silver markets rose in unison. However, trading weakened from strong to weary after large operators took profits at the close. In addition, the forward silver price in Monte Carlo declined, and London spot gold fell nine and a half pence. Exchange rates lengthened, and sentiment was slightly firm. The off-floor pre-market opened at 88.5 yuan, but due to a lack of supply, immediately rose to around 92 yuan. The central bank's official price was announced, with the British pound flat and the U.S. dollar rising. The tariff gold unit fell by 0.09 taels. The standard price of spot gold retreated to 830 yuan, slightly lower after a high. Although prices rose after opening, they retreated into the 90-dollar range due to the central bank taking advantage of the high price to release shillings, anticipating that the HSBC official price would remain unchanged. Sassoon also agreed to release gold, causing further declines. However, because buyers were active at lower prices, prices were able to maintain. HSBC continued to release shillings. At this time, prices began to fluctuate. Later, Reuters reported that the U.S. government's silver purchase policy would continue, immediately triggering a selling spree and breaking the 80-dollar mark again. However, details were not yet announced, so there were many buyers after the low point, making it easier to raise prices. Subsequently, the Associated Press, Reuters, and others reported that Treasury Secretary Morgenthau's speech involved the government continuing to purchase silver to restore silver's various extensive uses in the past, and prices retreated into the 80-dollar range again. However, due to spot exchange relationships, large traders took advantage of the low price to cover positions, and supply was not strong, so prices recovered. At noon, due to a lack of support, prices fluctuated in multiple directions and retreated into the 80-dollar range again. After the market closed, news of downstream continues to be weary, and the after-market continued to be weary. Later, as Indian silver initially rose only three annas, sentiment reversed and prices rose. Banks took advantage of the high price to release gold. Jewish merchant Jiao Zhifu continued to release shillings. Fuxingyong and other Guangdong merchants were extremely active in selling, causing prices to gradually decline. However, due to spot exchange relationships, large traders were very active in covering positions, and sentiment was still stable. HSBC continued to pull up shillings. Prices were easily raised after the low point, but mostly fluctuated. Finally, Indian silver rose only one anna for the second time. Buyers were very eager, and finally prices recovered. The market was strong at first, then weak, and finally the underlying trend was still stable. The rollover buying and selling for June and July will be held today.</p>
<p>The morning opening was 790 yuan and some cents, an increase of 3.5 yuan compared to the previous close. Hengyu, Tongyu, Run Chang, and Dajin rose to two yuan.

Hengyu, Fuxingyong, Shunli, Yongli Chang, Daheng Long, Dadecheng, Yingxiang, Fusheng, and Shui all sold. Anticipating that the HSBC official price would not move, prices retreated into the 90-dollar range. Sassoon was willing to release June shillings at 0.0625. Huixiang and Yongli Tongyu Run sold even further to 87.6 yuan. Dafa and Yong Hengyu Natao rose to 8.7 yuan. Dongxiang Changda Shengda still sold, and fell to 7.5 yuan. After that, there was a lot of consolidation. Changda Hengyu Dafa Yong Heng Jiang Shunmao all sold, gradually falling to 81.5 yuan. Hengyu Dada Chunyuanyong took advantage of the low price to natao, rising to 3.5 yuan. Dadecheng, Fuxingyong, Yingxiang, Hengyu, Changda sold lots. Reuters reported that the U.S. Treasury Department continued to purchase silver, falling to 78.8 yuan. Huixiang Hengyu took advantage of the low price to cover positions, rising to 82.5 yuan. Chunyuanyongda Fayong Heng Chang Yong slightly sold, retreating to 0.05 yuan. Fuxingyong Dada Cheng Yongli Hengyu Laijin then rose to 2.8 yuan. HSBC pulled 7 lots of July US dollars at 8125. Reuters, the Associated Press, and other agencies telegraphed that Treasury Secretary Morgenthau's speech said that the government would continue to purchase silver in order to restore silver to its former status, etc. Dadecheng Dafa Yong Huixiang Yingxiang Yiyu Changda Yuanmao Yong, etc. all sold down, falling to 78.5 yuan. Dadecheng Hengyu Yuanmao Yongli Feng repeatedly bought lots, rising to 83.8 yuan. Shunli Fuxingyong Wanfeng Dafa Yongyong Chenggao still sold, retreating into the 80-dollar range. Fuxingyong Yuanmao Yongjin came out again, falling further to 77.5 yuan. After fluctuating, the noon close was 777.6 yuan. After the market closed, multiple parties shook and suddenly turned bearish.</p>
<p>The after-market opened at 775 yuan and some cents. Fuxingyong Hanheng sold to four yuan. Hengyu entered to 5.7 yuan. Macari sold 6 lots of June US dollars at 3125 to HSBC.

<p>It is usually around this time of year that the silk and tea seasons begin, creating a need for funds, and the development of the banking industry also tends to shift focus to this period. However, this year, due to the urgency of the money market, merchants have not yet started purchasing, resulting in the same dullness in the inflow and outflow of silver dollars.

<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Chinese Securities Exchange saw slightly more activity, but prices trended slightly lower. This was because major players were still hedging, with no news of reversals, and some were even increasing their selling positions. As a result, there were slight fluctuations. The 1996 government bonds, in particular, showed no improvement in forward prices for several days, making it impossible for arbitrageurs to take advantage. Most players continued to deliver old bonds, remaining cautious about taking delivery of cash, and there was a possibility of continued small declines, as the number of accounts still held a massive 20 million yuan. The market weakened slightly in each of the two morning sessions, and showed no sign of improvement before the afternoon opening. Later, it became slightly firmer, but the 1996 bonds still showed no improvement. The closing price remained soft, and the situation seemed unlikely to be optimistic. The market results showed that only the 1919 Customs bonds for this month improved slightly by five cents, while other bonds all trended weaker, down by five cents to one, two, or three jiao. The total transaction volume was 8,175,000 yuan. The results of the price increases and decreases are listed below for comparison (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan).</p>

<p>The yarn market is weakening due to the sluggishness of the overseas cotton industry, which is good news for sellers. At the same time, spot yarn transactions have decreased compared to before, and there are rumors that a certain merchant is still preparing to deliver this month. As a result, speculative longs are uneasy and hesitant, and the market appears weary. However, it is said that a major long position holder, Yuan Da, is purchasing several thousand bales.</p>
<p>Golden Rooster Falls</p>
<p>The speculative yarn market opened with a stagnant and calm tone for each month, as the longs remained unmoved. A certain individual is said to be preparing for delivery. However, some longs have also decided to take delivery. As a result, the market is generally flat and weak. However, due to the unfavorable surrounding environment, most are leaning towards short positions. However, the closing price saw a slight drop, with each month falling by two to three jiao compared to the previous day's closing price, except for this month, which rose by one jiao. The afternoon opening saw a sudden drop. It is heard that the speculative gold market has fallen sharply, and the United States has not changed its silver policy. Therefore, the sentiment is not good. As a result, each month fell by three, four, five, or six jiao compared to the morning closing price. Notable sellers include Yi Da 150 bales, Da Feng 150 bales, Jun Chang 250 bales, Run Kang 1,150 bales, Tong Ji 650 bales, Ming De 150 bales, Chang Yu 850 bales, and Chang Yi 450 bales.

<p>The cotton market is trending downwards daily, due to the weakness of American cotton and Indian cotton following suit. The speculative gold market is also trending downwards, and exchange rates are rising, causing panic. Henan province has received heavy rain, which is beneficial to cotton fields. However, longs are holding tight to large amounts of credit, while spot cotton consumption is weak.</p>
<p>Zheng Speculative Softens</p>
<p>The speculative cotton market opened with continued declines in each month, due to the continued decline of American cotton and the decline of Indian cotton by 1.75 to 2.5 rupees. Longs are also liquidating, and selling pressure is slightly heavier. The north has received rain, and sentiment is easing. As a result, each month fell by five cents to one jiao compared to the previous day's closing price. The afternoon opening saw a sudden drop. It is heard that the speculative gold market has seen a decline, and news is unfavorable for longs. As a result, speculative longs are liquidating, and the market is particularly loose. However, Yuan Da's longs are gradually adding to their positions, accumulating a growing number of bales. As a result, each month fell by five cents to one and a half jiao compared to the morning closing price.

<p>Yesterday, the American cotton market opened with long positions liquidating. Foreign firms such as Liverpool, Continental, and Bombay were selling across the board, with each month falling by two to eight points. On the buying side, due to the weakness of the wheat market and cotton prices approaching 12 cents, there was a lack of enthusiasm. Dealers, however, were paying close attention, as the government had sold 200,000 to 300,000 bales of stored cotton last week and were expected to repurchase them in the futures market. Subsequently, the market was calm, with most activity involving rolling July contracts to more distant months. Before the close, long positions were liquidating, and the market remained weak. Spot prices fell by ten points, while futures prices fell by eight to fifteen points. English cotton spot prices fell by eight points, and futures prices fell by ten points. Indian cotton initially rose due to speculative purchases, but then softened due to sales by expert buyers. The price of Pingguoer fell by 0.25 to 2.25 rupees, Omra fell by 1 to 1.75 rupees, and Bairao Creek fell by 1.75 to 2.5 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (dated the 13th).</p>

<p>When the flour market opened, due to the continued decline of imported wheat and the good weather, and actual sales being cautious, the number of spot lots being sold off was quite large. Therefore, the opening price for this month was 5 jiao including customs duties, as low as 4 jiao and 8 fen. The price for June and subsequent months also fell by close to a cent or so. However, after the second session, speculative shorts were covering their positions, and factories mostly stopped selling. As a result, the market sentiment turned steady again. When the afternoon session opened, although trading was not very active, the Tianjin group showed slight movement again. Therefore, amidst stability, there was a steady trend. It is observed that the current spot flour inventory of various factories is very tight, and prices are also being increased by 5 fen. Therefore, there is little hope of prices falling significantly before the new wheat harvest. As a result, this month fell by 2.5 li, June fell by 7.5 li, July fell by 1.25 fen, August and September fell by 0.5 fen, and October fell by 1 fen.</p>
<p>The wheat market saw imported wheat quoted with Chicago falling by around 4 to 5 jiao, and Canada closed. When the market opened, due to the aftereffects of the sharp decline the previous day, coupled with the continued decline of imported wheat, the opening price for July once fell as low as 5 jiao and 9 fen. August and September also each fell by 1 to 2 fen. However, after the first session, due to sluggish selling by those selling off their positions, market sentiment gradually recovered, and the price recovered by 2 to 3 fen compared to the initial opening price. When the afternoon session opened, trading in each month was quite active, and prices also gradually stabilized. Although the weather is good, the new wheat has not yet been harvested, and the inland sellers are ultimately reluctant to sell off freely. As a result, July actually rose by 2 fen, August rose by 4 fen, and September rose by 3 fen. Spot wheat prices are seeing relatively smooth deliveries, with prices falling slightly. The opening price for Xuzhou wheat is 9 yuan and 9 li, Shuikou Henan wheat is 4 yuan and 4 fen, Jiangbei wheat is 3 yuan and 9 jiao and 8 fen, and Zhumadian wheat is 3 yuan and 9 jiao and 9 fen, Hankou wheat is 3 yuan and 9 jiao. A total of 4,000 bags were purchased by Fuxin.</p>
<p>Chicago wheat saw unqualified grades delivered again today. The factory market is weak. Visible supply decreased by 2,955,500 bushels last week.</p>
<p>Chicago Wheat May 11 - May 13 - Change</p>
<p>July - 94.00 - 92.50 - Down 1.50</p>
<p>September - 94.875 - 93.50 - Down 1.50</p>
<p>Spot - 102.50 - 102.00 - Down 0.50</p>
<p>Canadian Wheat May 11 - May 13 - Change</p>

<h3 id="e192">Rice Prices Initially Fall Slightly, Then Rebound <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, sources in South Shanghai suddenly became scarce, with only boats numbered 14 and 15 arriving (totaling nearly 3,000 shi), resulting in a tight situation. However, sales were not quick, and buyers only purchased a hundred or so bags, turning the market situation to normal. As a result, the prices of various thick glutinous rice and japonica rice only increased by one jiao to one and a half jiao, while the improvement in other types was not very promising.</p>
<p>Yesterday, although there were not many boats arriving in the northern part of Shanghai (Hebei region) from various routes, the boats that had arrived previously were determined, with many reluctant to sell. As a result, there were 30 to 40 samples offered yesterday morning. The goods on the market were being purchased, with white glutinous rice continuing to be sold, and early thin rice being selected. White yuan saw slight transactions. Market prices for high-quality white glutinous rice were fixed, while medium and low-quality rice became tighter by several points. Early thin rice saw little change, and white yuan was stable.</p>
<p>The imported rice market initially weakened, but then demand from inland regions increased, and domestic customers, seeing that transactions were active and production prices were high, were no longer willing to sell cheaply. Even the low-quality rice that had been flooding in recently stabilized due to the persistence of the cargo owners. After days of stagnation, the local market saw some Saigon small-grain rice sold yesterday, with even stronger inland demand. As a result, the market rebounded from weakness. A total of 14,000 bags of Saigon rice were sold in the market, 8,000 bags of small-pattern rice, and over 1,000 bags of Siam, Katir, and other types. Prices were similar to the previous day.</p>
<p>Customer indica rice inventories are gradually dwindling, and arrivals have been scarce for a long time. Only recently have there been a small number of arrivals from Sichuan and Yichang, which are welcomed by inland regions. However, the arrival volume is extremely low, and production prices are also high, preventing it from becoming widely available in the market. Only due to the extremely high quality of the goods is it not easy to significantly lower the selling price. Yesterday, 75 bags of Yichang milled rice, 100 bags of Sichuan milled rice, and 114 bags of Hunan milled rice were offered, with slight price increases. All were purchased by inland buyers.</p>

<p>Yesterday, Guangdong's purchases of sesame became more active, causing the market price to increase by 2 jiao. The transaction volume included 600 bags of Bengbu sesame at a price of 5.95 to 6.07 yuan, 500 bags of Mingguang sesame at a price of 6.22 yuan, 150 bags of Haozhou sesame at a price of 6.75 yuan, 850 bags of Liuhe sesame at a price ranging from 7 yuan to 6.7 yuan, 300 bags of Fu Liji sesame at a price of 6 yuan, and 300 bags of Yingzhou yellow sesame at a price of 6.72 yuan. In addition, the Shantou group purchased 186 bags of Jiujiang white sesame at a price of 6.75 yuan. As a result, the market for foreign warehouse net goods was also tightened. It is heard that the cable price is 8.95 yuan. The second batch of Wenzhou new broad beans, 150 bags, arrived yesterday via the Sanjiang steamer at a price of 3.6 yuan. The quality of the goods is higher than the first batch and was purchased by the Tianjin group.</p>

<p>Yesterday, foreign firms in Shanghai sold over 130 bales of new silk. British, French, and Citibank all showed activity. There were still some transactions that did not go through due to exchange rate issues. Currently, the silk market is indeed not as vibrant as in previous years, but it is still somewhat satisfactory. It is heard that if exchange rates can fall to a reasonable level, the silk market can gradually become prosperous.</p>

<p>Yesterday, new goods of Tunxi Fine Eyebrow Green Tea arrived in Shanghai. Jin Jiang Foreign Firm opened the first lot at 87 yuan, which is 45 yuan lower per dan than last year. The Fine Eyebrow Green Tea from other routes such as Sui'an Tu Zhuang also fell by 4 to 5 yuan across the board. For Qimen Black Tea, European firms showed strong interest in high-quality goods yesterday, but ordinary goods still did not see smooth sales. Observing the current situation, the opening prices of black and green tea are much lower than in previous years, and the market sentiment is also scattered. The market has not been able to stabilize.</p>

<p>The transactions of large tinplate among customers and factories have been very quiet recently, and the market situation is quite leisurely. However, door shop business has always been uniquely thriving, so the goods offered are still somewhat satisfactory. Due to the small amount of incoming goods, the market is still quite strong. Currently, 24-gauge sheets are priced at 1.35 yuan per sheet, estimating 65 yuan per box (50 sheets). 26-gauge sheets are sold at 1.15 yuan per sheet, selling 55 yuan per box (50 sheets). It is found that over 10 boxes have been offered in the past two days, and it is heard that most of the buyers are toy factories.</p>

<p>Yesterday, summer wool fabric sales were not weak. The West Clothing Group saw relatively good sales. The Sichuan group saw coordinated purchases by resident Shanghai customers due to the large drop in exchange rates. Unfortunately, there were still no large-volume orders. Uniform Cloth saw strong sales in the West, with grayish-yellow Uniform Cloth being the most active. Brown and Yuan Chang colors were still ordinary, while white sales were sluggish. Even with prices being one to two jiao cheaper, it was not easy to sell. Yesterday, formal No. 1 Uniform Cloth was sold at 4.1 yuan per batch, deputy No. 3.8 yuan, and secondary No. 3.5 to 3.6 yuan.</p>

<h3 id="e198">Who Puts the Focus of the Water Margin on Yun Prefecture? <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>— Linglu</p>
<p>Determining the location of Liangshan Marsh is probably helpful for those who enjoy studying the Water Margin, but it seems unnecessary to try to explain why Song Jiang would base himself there. I have always suspected whether Song Jiang and others ever permanently occupied Liangshan Marsh, but I have no interest in researching it. The simple reasons for my suspicion should be obvious and not worth publishing. However, since I have yet to see a similar and more insightful view, and some people are exploring in the opposite direction, my opinion might finally be worth mentioning.</p>
<p>According to various consistent references, the historical Song Jiang's bandit group originated in Hebei and was recruited into the imperial army in Haizhou. In between, they "rampaged through Qi and Wei," "attacked Huaiyang Military Prefecture," and "raided Jingdong." Thus, Song Jiang and his followers were clearly a band of roaming bandits. Their route was somewhat similar to that of Liu Hei Qi, who fled from Hebei back to Shandong the year before last. Although Song Jiang may not have covered such a long distance in the same short period, his life as a roaming bandit seems to have been just as short. The official histories do not record when Song Jiang started in Hebei, but the Stories of the Xuanhe Era records that Yang Zhi, Li Jinyi, and others went to the Taihang Mountains to become outlaws in the second year of Xuanhe. This was the earliest group of the thirty-six outlaws, and the location aligns with the official history's origin in Hebei, and the timing may also be credible. Therefore, the time until their failure was just over a year, likely without enough time to establish a base in a mountain stronghold.</p>
<p>Wu Jialiang and six others were the second group to become outlaws, joining Yang Zhi and the twelve others, naturally also going to the Taihang Mountains. Here the name Liangshan Marsh appears, but this Liangshan Marsh is in the Taihang Mountains. Part of the Taihang Mountains was called Liangshan, and the Taihang Mountains were known for having many bandits, which is unnecessary to seek remote evidence that Shandong's Liangshan Marsh was also known for its bandit lairs. The subsequent addition of thirteen more probably also happened in the Taihang Mountains. Later, as their power grew, they roamed through Qi and Wei. Huyan Zhuo and others fought against them without success, and upon joining the group, the number of outlaws reached thirty-six, likely occurring on the way.</p>
<p>If they had a relatively fixed location during their roaming, it was probably in the Huai River basin. The Yuan Dynasty zaju play "Double Contribution" describes Liangshan's terrain as: "The stronghold is named Water Margin, the marsh is called Liangshan; a thousand rivers and harbors crisscross, eight hundred li in all directions; east to the sea, west to Jiyang, south across Juye and Jinxiang, north to Qing, Qi, Yan, and Yun." This already moves Liangshan Marsh to the vicinity described in the later Water Margin, but clearly further south and east. Even if there was not necessarily a suitable area to establish Liangshan Marsh in this region, the author was willing to move Liangshan Marsh to accommodate the story he knew, so it is believable that the location of Liangshan Marsh was more fluid.</p>
<p>Who fixed Liangshan Marsh to Yun Prefecture? Since no one has asked the above question, no one has explored it. I also lack the ability and desire to try to answer the question. It can be vaguely assumed to be the person who wrote the earliest base text for the current version of the Water Margin. Between the Stories of the Xuanhe Era and Luo's Water Margin, there seems to be little room for multiple changes. If there was only one change, then it must have been Shi Nai'an. Based on the content of the Water Margin, the person who wrote this book was likely from western Shandong, not Shi Nai'an from Hangzhou. However, Southern people seem to have their own special legends about Song Jiang, or it is possible that someone from Hangzhou wrote a Song Jiang book that was not the ancestor of the later Water Margin. The relationship between the two is definitely not very close. The book industry in Hangzhou was quite developed at that time, and perhaps when the early version of the Water Margin became popular, Hangzhou also printed it, and the booksellers randomly added the name of a writer known in the local area. This rumor was also spread based on what was recorded in notebooks. (To be continued) Wo Pu</p>

<p>— Wo Pu</p>
<p>Excerpts from the Four Great Masters' Legends</p>
<p>A collection of miscellaneous dramas from the Qing dynasty, featuring excerpts from the legends of four great masters of prose from the Che Jiang Ying collection. These are divided into the stories of four great masters of ancient prose: Han, Liu, Ou, and Su, namely: "Snow at Lan Pass" (Han), "Mist of Liuzhou" (Liu), "Drunken Pavilion" (Ou), and "Journey to Red Cliff" (Su). All of these use the most popular events in their lives as titles.</p>
<p>Based on my careful reading, I believe that these four pieces are actually legends (chuanqi), not miscellaneous dramas (zaju). Each legend has had several acts extracted and published separately, resembling the nature of selected opera collections. Perhaps they are even unfinished legends, with only a few excerpts released first. (More details below) The term "excerpts" clearly indicates "several extracted acts." The preface by Junyi Sanren says, "Like Xu Wenchang's 'Four Cries of a Gibbon,' it is a rare work from You Zhan Cheng's West Hall Opera House." Although the example given is a zaju, Che's work, like "Four Cries of a Gibbon," combines the stories of Han, Liu, Ou, and Su, similar to how "Peach Blossom Spring" and "Reading Lisao" depict Tao Yuanming and Qu Yuan. One cannot simply use this as evidence that "Excerpts from the Legends of the Four Great Masters" is a zaju or an imitation of Xu and You. There is little doubt that its essence is a legend. A major point of observation is that the themes of each act are inconsistent and full of gaps, lacking cohesion, and the connections are fragmented and incomplete. This is very solid evidence. Below, we will present each one individually.</p>
<p>First, let's look at "Snow at Lan Pass." The theme of this piece should be "Snow Blocking Lan Pass." Shouldn't the legend of Han Xiangzi's attempts to convert Duke Wen be somewhat selected? But Han Xiangzi disappears after returning home to see his wife in the first act, "Return to Xiang." The next acts are (2) "Reporting Shame," depicting Han Yu's appointment to the Huai Xi army; (3) "Enjoying Snow," depicting the capture of Wu Yuanji during a snowy night raid on Caizhou; and (4) "Heng Mountain," depicting Yu ascending Heng Mountain. The story of "Clouds over the Qin Mountains" is not mentioned at all.</p>
<p>The second piece, "Mist of Liuzhou," is very interesting. The author probably still cannot escape the cliché of romance, finding a romance for Liu Zongyuan and Liu Mengde, who both become sons-in-law of Wang Shuwen's family. But the story is still fragmented and incomplete, and we cannot find the concrete unfolding and writing of the true story. (1) "Spring Chamber" introduces Wang Shuwen's two daughters, Wu Ying and Jiu Ying. (2) "Chanting in Response" connects to Liu and Liu passing the imperial examination, receiving silk whips, and going to the Wang family to have the two daughters test their poetry and chant in response. (3) "Folk Songs" depicts Liu's banishment to Lianzhou, hearing of Liu's beautiful administration in Liuzhou. (4) "Post Station Wine Cup" is the grand finale, where Liu, Liu, and Wang's two daughters finally reunite. The incident of the Eight Sima should be the turning point of separation and reunion in the play, with too many gaps and an impossible plot to predict.</p>
<p>In "Drunken Pavilion," the author also fantasizes about a tragic and beautiful romance for him. (1) "Autumn Sound" alludes to the "Autumn Sound Rhapsody." (2) "Reluctant Farewell" depicts Yongshu's farewell to his wife because he is going to the capital to seek fame. This act is completely imitating the "South Pei" from the "Pipa" record. (3) "Mourning Stone" is Yongshu mourning the death of Shi Manqing. (4) "Hibiscus Pavilion" depicts Ouyang's wife, Xu, dying of illness, her soul traveling to the Hibiscus Fairy Pavilion, but Shi Manqing, the lord of the Hibiscus City, takes care of his friend and finds a way to revive her. (5) "Returning Soul" when she wakes up, her husband is away, having "passed the imperial examination and been selected for the literary academy," probably not even knowing his wife was ill? Although the story is absurd, it has no beginning or end, and the events of the Drunken Pavilion are not mentioned. It is likely that the excerpts are mostly from the first half of the legend.</p>
<p>Finally, "Journey to Red Cliff" is the only one that realistically portrays the events indicated by the title. (4) "Red Cliff," (2) "Returning to the Courtyard," depicts the granting of the Golden Lotus by the emperor. The rest (1) "Examining the Son-in-Law," (3) "A Farewell," (5) "Later Meeting," all write about Qin Shaoyou, Su Xiaomei, and the Chu woman Huang Yigu (equivalent to the character Wenjuan or Bian Zhaohua). Like a fragment of the plot from "Ju Mountain Scholar Earns Wenjuan's Love," it is not directly about Dongpo.</p>
<p>What is cited here is only a rough outline. There are various places where the plots of each act are disconnected, but they are still connected by a thread, visible everywhere. All this proves that it is definitely not a complete zaju with four or five acts that has a beginning and an end, nor is each act an independent short play like Jing Shi Shan's "Loose Suite of the Dream of the Red Chamber." In the existing "excerpts," the portrayal of the protagonist is often less than that of other supporting characters (such as Liu Yuxi in "Mist of Liuzhou," and Qin Guan in "Journey to Red Cliff," whose roles are more important and almost equal to Liu and Su). Each of these four pieces should have at least thirty acts or more; otherwise, it would probably not be able to accommodate so many branching, lengthy, complex, and tortuous plot points.</p>
<p>Why did Che want to publish this incomplete piece? Are there complete versions of these four legends? Regarding this point, I suspect that his complete legends have not yet been written; he only has a complete outline and a plan for dividing the acts, and then he is slowly filling in the acts step by step. Perhaps the later acts were done first, not necessarily in order. This is a common experience in writing opera. The phrase "Excerpts from the Filled Lyrics of the Four Great Masters" in the book's seam is worth pondering. As a result, the entire book was never completed, so he made do with what he had and hastily published it, using the word "excerpts" to cover up his shortcomings, perhaps? The fact that the acts are not numbered with "First," "Second," etc. may also be a side proof that they are not complete zaju formats; on the other hand, it may be because the acts in the legends are not fully completed, the order is chaotic, and cannot be determined. Since it is labeled "excerpts," there is no need to hide the original order of the acts. Besides, I cannot think of any other reason why this anthology-style, disconnected "excerpts" would need to be published separately. There seems to be a lack of similar examples of this type of opera collection.</p>
<p>According to Junyi Sanren's preface, Che is from Jiangxi. The year of the preface is Yongzheng Yimao (1735). This is all that is known about his time, place, and life. If half of the above speculation is not true and the four legends are indeed completed, then we will be able to learn more if we are fortunate enough to discover them in the future.</p>
<p>For the sake of the editing style of Qing Dynasty miscellaneous dramas, it would be best to remove it in future reprints, or include it as an appendix, which would be more appropriate. I wonder what the editors and printers think?</p>

<p>— Hewei</p>
<p>He whispered to himself, tears glistening in his eyes. But he was not disappointed, only felt resentment. His uncle and aunt had not come out yet; it must be the old woman who was interfering, not allowing Juanzi to come out with them. Tianli seemed to see Juanzi struggling, pleading, arguing, trying to escape the clutches of that old woman. But that old witch was imprisoning Juanzi, not letting her move a step freely. He thought of the old woman's toothless mouth, that wrinkled face, those fierce and sinister eyes, those dry, corpse-like hands, and suddenly felt a chill all over his body. The white old house also seemed to turn into a gloomy ghost cave in an instant.</p>
<p>He was angry, trembling, only thinking about how Juanzi could live in this environment and how to save her from this kind of life, and unknowingly had already walked to the foot of the ridge.</p>
<p>Just at this moment, he ran into his uncle.</p>
<p>"What, uncle, are you always so oblivious to the world! I've been waiting for you all day; even a trip to the capital should be back by now. How could you..."</p>
<p>"No, no, don't rush!" His uncle, holding a lantern in his hand, hurriedly stopped him.</p>
<p>"Don't rush?"</p>
<p>"Yes, yes, rushing is useless! It's all that hateful old woman; as soon as she heard me talking to Juanzi in a low voice, she came to stop us. And like escorting a prisoner, wherever Juanzi went, she followed. What could I do?"</p>
<p>"So I waited all day in the pavilion, and Juanzi didn't even know?"</p>
<p>"I'm afraid so."</p>
<p>The uncle answered in embarrassment, secretly looking at Tianli's bloodshot eyes burning with fierce fire. Tianli's face was turning ashen, and his hands and feet were trembling as if afraid of the cold.</p>
<p>"How can I be content with this... Fine, let me go find Juanzi myself, and see what that old woman can do to me... Does she think she can eat me? What am I afraid of? ... Uncle ... come with me, let me take the lantern!"</p>
<p>"No, Tianli, why would you want to go and bring bad luck upon yourself?"</p>
<p>The pitiful and weak uncle pleaded in a low voice, but Tianli, having made up his mind, snatched the lantern and ran towards that stone house without looking back, leaving his uncle standing blankly at the dark foot of the ridge, listening to the continuous and mournful sound of the spring rain falling.

<h3 id="e201">Trivia at Dusk (Part 1) <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>— Shao Guanhua</p>
<p>Dragging my tired legs, I boarded the motorboat; with a "whoosh," the boat set off immediately. The waves cradled the boat, trembling, drifting from this shore to that shore in just fifteen minutes.</p>
<p>Ornate silk ribbons were tied to bamboo poles on the shore, and dozens of electric lights shone brightly, adding to the energy of the dusk.</p>
<p>I had to go to the ×× Hall for some trivial matters, which made my heart even more lonely.</p>
<p>My legs were still tired, so I called for a rickshaw.</p>
<p>—Rickshaw, ×× Hall!</p>
<p>—Three hundred cash.</p>
<p>—Two hundred and forty.</p>
<p>After confirming the deal, I placed myself on the rickshaw, following the route the rickshaw was taking, my body being moved along.</p>
<p>The elderly rickshaw puller perked up, pulling the rickshaw and running along the dilapidated city edge.</p>
<p>The ground was covered with dirt, with small, sharp stones standing on it. The rickshaw moved over these two materials, bumping almost as much as the sedan chairs I often passed through in the countryside of × county in Jiangnan.</p>
<p>Upon arriving at the ×× Hall, I finished the things I needed to do and came out. My legs were even more tired, so I had to sit in the rickshaw. I went to ×× Road to buy some odds and ends.</p>
<p>The wind gently blew on my shoulders, and I suddenly woke up from my fatigue. Looking ahead, I realized that the rickshaw puller was dragging me to another road.</p>
<p>Low, flat houses stood on both sides of the road the rickshaw was dragging through. Kerosene lamps were placed on wooden tables in each house, emitting the same weak light in different directions. Once the rickshaw had passed, the darkness of the starless dusk enveloped the front again.</p>
<p>—It's so hard to walk here, the rickshaw puller said.</p>
<p>—Who told you to pull here in this dark place? Couldn't you have taken the other road? It's just a little further, I said.</p>
<p>—Hmm.</p>
<p>So I reached into my pocket, took out a flashlight, and rubbed it. Its light shone five feet ahead of the rickshaw.</p>
<p>—Good, the rickshaw puller shouted again.</p>
<p>Relying on the not-so-bright light of the flashlight, I could vaguely see a small wall, and in front of the wall, a few newly sprouted willow trees were planted, revealing a child-like breath.</p>
<p>Two minutes later, the rickshaw moved me in another direction. The black iron gates closed the slightly tidy house number. Under the electric light, ×× Lane No. 15 was quite clearly visible.</p>
<h3 id="e202">Rambling Talk on Willpower and Other Things, to Brother Mo Fei <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>— Yang Sao</p>
<p>Brother Mo Fei:</p>
<p>I am now staying in N City again, living with Brother Dan, temporarily being a big parasite. Today, from the letter you sent to Brother Dan, I know that you are still concerned about my job problem. I felt a sense of warmth between people for a moment, and this prompted me to fulfill the desire to write you a letter that I have long had. However, when I pick up the pen, I don't know what to write. Let me just say some empty words.</p>
<p>The older a person gets, unless the harsh environment makes them truly senile and unwilling or unable to think, their understanding of all phenomena—natural and human—will naturally become more profound and accurate. Therefore, there are many examples, both ancient and modern, of people who initially could not understand each other, or even opposed and devoured each other, eventually becoming harmonious or embracing under a completely consistent view after the passage of time. A person's emotions, willpower, and consciousness are undoubtedly determined by their physiological state and, more importantly, their circumstances. I remember arguing with you on the upper floor of a certain newspaper office about the question of free will. At that time, you were a believer in free will, and I was exactly the opposite. In the past year or two, I don't know if your view has changed? I am completely the same as before, that is, I do not believe in free will. Moreover, the life experience of the past year or two has strengthened my belief. I believe that the barriers between people are extremely thin and easily torn apart, caused by differences in physiology and circumstances. If this membrane, which is not divinely ordained—there is no divinely ordained phenomenon in the universe—but is easily changeable or transformable, is pierced, and two people have relatively similar living environments, and thus have relatively similar emotions, intellect, and consciousness, then the two people can definitely be friends. Is it that you were born to like to eat rice, and I am destined to eat wheat and oppose you? Is it that Brother Dan brought a Hamlet-type personality from his mother's womb, and Mr. He's arrogance was given by God? No, definitely not! Your willingness to eat rice is cultivated by the tradition that China produces a lot of rice and that Chinese people eat rice. I originally ate rice too, but my stomach disease determined that I must eat wheat. Furthermore, Brother Dan's Hamlet-type personality and Mr. He's arrogance each have their own reasons, each caused by their respective living environments. Moreover, these characteristics, emotions, wishes, willpower, etc., which are slowly created by the living environment, are not solidified and unchangeable. They will change with the changes in the living environment. Therefore, the hatred and misunderstanding between people will not be permanent, and it is possible for people to shake hands and walk the same path. Also for this reason, the phenomenon of in-laws becoming mortal enemies is extremely natural and often makes us see it, making us feel sad.</p>
<p>These rigid and superficial words will definitely make you smile, and there is really no need to say them. However, if I think about wanting to let you know that I am now much more optimistic than before because of this more solid understanding of this shallow recognition, I should not be afraid of you laughing at my shallowness and say it. Do you know, from this deeper understanding of the non-freedom of emotions and willpower, I have reduced a lot of sadness for all kinds of helpless separations, and increased infinite hope for the various barriers that cannot be brought together now. Therefore, I feel lighter; I feel that I am not oppressed by nostalgia and disappointment, and my future is bright! Walking along the right path, I will have many companions along the way. Although some are destined to leave me or abandon me, new ones will continue to come. I will never be alone, as long as I do not avoid the current society out of disgust. Yes, this society, its form, its direction, and people's willpower and emotions, like the people's will and emotions, also change due to the changes in the various institutions that organize it, and it is changing every moment. I cannot live optimistically in this constantly moving society and let the environment determine my actions. Then why should I be sad, sentimental, disappointed, and depressed? Everything is not accidental. I can recognize the inevitable, and if I set my destiny on the path of the inevitable, then I'm done!</p>
<p>I babbled a lot of nonsense, and I don't even know where this nonsense came from. I think it must have its source, but I don't feel it myself. I guess that this nonsense may even make you criticize me for becoming a mechanical person, because I seem to have no willpower at all, because I completely deny free will. However, let me declare in advance that this is not the case. I have not and cannot become a mechanical person. That's right, I completely deny the "freedom" of willpower, but I do not deny the "effect" of willpower. I still have willpower. Perhaps this can comfort a friend who is still concerned about my job problem overseas.</p>
<p>I have been in N City for nearly a month, and I have not done anything, nor have I written any articles. I am really a little worried. My job is of course hanging in mid-air; it will not fall down by itself unless I flap my wings and dance to take it. But in any case, I will reasonably strive to live from now on. I will not have as much trouble as before, with few smiles, too much sentimental behaviour, and not enough masculinity, making my friends uncomfortable to see.</p>
<p>I hope you can communicate often when you have time. Please give my regards to your wife. Aren't you about to raise a child? And I wish your future little treasure health!</p>

<h3 id="e203">Banning Coeducation in Middle Schools <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>— Xing An</p>
<p>Beijing, a city with ancient culture, has recently been banning coeducation in middle schools. According to a Beijing dispatch on the 25th, the ban on coeducation in municipal middle schools in Beijing has been implemented. Now the municipal government has issued another order banning coeducation in private middle schools. All must comply from this summer onwards in order to maintain morality.</p>
<p>The practice of coeducation in our country has been around for several years. Now, why is the Beijing authorities suddenly issuing an order to ban it? According to the declaration in the Beijing Municipal Government's ban, the purpose of banning coeducation in middle schools is "to maintain morality." From this perspective, it seems that the Beijing education community, which has practiced coeducation for several years, has probably already discovered some incidents related to morality in the past. Therefore, the Beijing authorities are now issuing an order to ban it in order to prevent the continued occurrence of such incidents. If this guess is correct, then the Beijing authorities' issuance of an order to ban coeducation in middle schools this time is commendable for its painstaking effort. Otherwise, Beijing's ban is a bit too abrupt. What's being sold in this gourd is probably something else.</p>
<p>Can middle schools practice coeducation? This question really doesn't need to be discussed anymore. What we need to pay attention to here is whether coeducation in middle schools will hinder morality. This is the point. Those who oppose coeducation in middle schools have always argued that young people are at a time of maturity during their middle school years. Contact between men and women often leads to free love affairs, so they advocate that men and women should not be in the same school. This reason seems to be right but is not. It must be understood that coeducation is one thing, and free love is another. Does banning coeducation prevent free love affairs between young men and women? Taking a step back, it is inevitable that free love will occur between young men and women in coeducation. But is this a mysterious period for young men and women that can be forcibly prohibited? If it is said that young men and women should strive to learn and pursue knowledge during their middle school years, and if they embark on the path of free love, there is a risk of neglecting their studies, then it is better for middle schools to be segregated. This sounds very reasonable. But we have to ask, does banning coeducation prevent young people from free love? Then, if young men and women who are generally in segregated schools also engage in free love, will this neglect their studies?</p>
<p>Taking another step back, it is because of coeducation that young people engage in free love. But is it immoral for young men and women to engage in free love? No, right? If it is said that legitimate free love between young men and women is also harmful to morality, then there are really too many such immoral things in society. Even if the authorities want to maintain it, they will feel that there is no way to maintain it.</p>
<p>However, the Beijing authorities are now issuing an order to ban coeducation in middle schools. We really cannot figure out what morality there is to maintain in coeducational middle schools.</p>

<p>— Hua Zhi</p>
<p>The weariness of life often leads me to sit alone under the lamp, gazing at the sky dotted with stars. Time, like that, flies by without the slightest hesitation. One evening, rain drizzled outside the window, and the sky was a blurry haze. The land of freedom where my eyes usually roamed was now shifted to the naked portrait hanging on the wall. The days passed even faster in my memory. As I was about to vow to cherish my future again, a gentle sound of leather shoes echoed from the stairs, the sound clearly directed towards my room. Hearing an unfamiliar voice, as refined as a woman’s, asking for my name, I felt as though I had been waiting for this uninvited guest. When I opened the door, the lamplight</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>shone onto the face of the visitor, and I quickly thought of a polite greeting to offer him.</p>
<p>The visitor had a slender figure, paired with a thin face. Underneath a mess of disheveled hair, his disarray was even more apparent. Because I was standing with my back to the light, the visitor hesitated slightly, just as I was taking him in. Then, an overwhelming joy made him exclaim:</p>
<p>"Old friend, I never thought we’d meet again!"</p>
<p>He tightly grasped my hand at the same time. In my bewilderment, I was awakened by the fiery gaze in his eyes. It was my old classmate, Xu Jun.</p>
<p>After graduating from a county school in the countryside, I went to Shanghai to attend university. I was not accustomed to the surrounding environment and often confined myself to the dormitory like a bookworm. Xu Jun was my roommate. He was a modern college student, well-versed in all sorts of university pastimes. For example, he knew various dance steps. When he walked across the lawn like a gentleman, he whistled popular songs. As for sports, he was the target of all the school beauties. I cannot describe him in detail; in short, he and I were too far apart. Perhaps there were times when we didn’t even meet. I don't know if he looked down on me, but our incompatibility was an undeniable fact.</p>
<p>Such a modern youth—when I stepped out of the school gates and was whipped by the realities of life, if it weren't for the familiar gaze I once dared not meet, I wouldn't have believed that the person now holding my hand was Xu Jun from back then.</p>
<p>After we sat down, he used his sharp eyes to survey my bedroom. Although we were not as estranged as we were in the dormitory, he still felt that this dilapidated building was not fitting for welcoming a dear classmate whom he hadn’t seen in so long. But he said:</p>
<p>"The situation is very good!"</p>
<p>He pulled a cigarette from the tin and smiled as if in envy. This made me feel even more ashamed, regardless of whether he was mocking me or not. I turned the writing chair to face away from the light, thinking of some opening remarks to politely respond to him, but no matter how hard I tried, I just couldn't come up with the words. He lit the cigarette, walked over, and gently patted my shoulder, showing a kind of American-style familiarity, while pacing around the room with small steps.</p>
<p>"How has life been these past few years?" I finally asked him.</p>
<p>He immediately stopped and repeated my question, "Good!"</p>
<p>"I heard you’re doing quite well!" he laughed like a tiger. "This time, I came back from Nanjing and met Old Wang on the train. He told me you’ve been doing very well recently."</p>
<p>Looking at his sincere attitude, I couldn’t suspect that he was mocking me, but what could I say to satisfy him?</p>
<p>"Old friend, please keep an eye out for opportunities for me," he finally said, uttering the words I had already guessed.</p>
<p>I nodded subconsciously, looking into my old classmate’s probing eyes.</p>
<h3 id="e205">Son <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>— Ling Zixi</p>
<p>From the time when Sister-in-law Jin told a few gossipy women at the riverbank about the news in the morning, by noon, almost everyone in this small village of only about twenty families was talking about the same thing: "The woman that Genfu newly married has been going out every night for the past three days!"</p>
<p>The person who talked about this the most enthusiastically and described it most vividly was Sister-in-law Jin, who lived next door to Genfu. She had started "keeping tabs" on Genfu's wife (since Sister-in-law Jin’s suggestion, no one in the village called the newly arrived woman "Genfu's wife"!) from the moment "Genfu's wife" entered Genfu's house in a small red sedan chair amidst the playing of the three drummers and Taoist priests hired from the Daoshi Temple above Banpo. The reasons were there: Genfu worked in Shanghai, leaving an old mother at home, and her meals and other needs were all taken care of by Sister-in-law Jin for six silver dollars a month. Now that Genfu had brought back a wife, this business would certainly not be successful. Secondly, it was said that the "new bride" had no manners. She didn’t even call Sister-in-law Jin "Auntie Jin" when she made her greetings. So, after three days, Sister-in-law Jin used an odd tone to shout in the ears of Genfu's half-deaf mother: "Your good daughter-in-law is worth a lot, with her oily hair and bright face, she’s worth a lot! Hmph, hmph!"</p>
<p>And, after seeing Genfu's wife sneaking out of the back door for three nights in a row, the first person to tell everyone else about it would of course be none other than Sister-in-law Jin. "Hmph! I told you all a long time ago: a woman with oily hair and a bright face, without roots or support, can’t be a good sort! ... Every night, she always goes out with her hair slicked back and her face shiny; and when she comes back, the way she looks is... Oh my... you haven't seen it yet (in fact, even Sister-in-law Jin herself had never seen what she looked like when she came back). Oh my... it’s sickening! How can this kind of thing endure it when Genfu is working outside for months at a time! There will be more jokes later, you watch and see..."</p>
<p>In fact, it was true that Genfu's wife had been secretly going out every night recently, but it was not necessarily true that she had "no roots or support": when people "arranged" for this woman to marry Genfu, they also asked matchmakers to write a "marriage agreement". She was a pretty little widow from the next village over, and she had no one else in her family. Originally, she didn’t want to remarry, but her husband had died, and she didn’t have enough to eat, so..."</p>
<p>Genfu's own wife had been dead for two years, and his old mother at home needed someone to take care of her; and he himself was always working in Shanghai. It would be good to have a family, even if he could only come back once or twice a month. So, taking advantage of the fact that he had some money on hand, he spent fifty silver dollars to get a "clean and tidy" wife.</p>
<p>However, at the very moment when the story of "Genfu's wife going out every night..." was spreading throughout the village, Genfu also heard the rumors from his fellow villagers in Shanghai, and secretly came back with a fiery murderous intent. On the first night, he silently squatted in the dark corner that Sister-in-law Jin had arranged, and watched as the woman went out as usual at night, then quietly followed her!</p>
<p>Having already crossed to the next village, Genfu's wife, as if carrying a kind of urgent longing, immediately entered a half-closed door.</p>
<p>Inside the door, there were children's laughter and women's laughter: "Good child, good child, be good. If it weren’t for you, Mommy would have followed your dead dad long ago..."</p>
<p>It was already more than he could bear. As if having gone mad, Genfu burst through the door and dragged the woman out: "Good for you, you big whore!" And then, by the time he dragged her home, he had already beaten her half to death. "If it wasn’t for this son, if it wasn’t for..." All the woman could say was these few words.</p>
<p>Half a month later, Genfu did not return, and everyone in the village also knew that Genfu's wife had a son in the village ahead; but when some of the women began to forgive her, Genfu’s wife had already hanged herself on a tree branch in front of the door.</p>

<h3 id="e207">Withering Flower <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>— Rong</p>
<p>Those who have never been married see marriage as a vibrant flower, its fragrance rich, its posture alluring, as elegant as a magnolia in the morning mist, as passionate as a rose entwined with summer lightning, as mellow as a drunken hibiscus leaning lazily on green leaves. But this childish fantasy is just like a fresh flower; once crushed by the iron fist of reality, it immediately withers and dries up.</p>
<p>In my memory, which is covered with the dust of years, there is a spring that will never disappear. It may be a flower that withered and faded after releasing its color and fragrance, but its sweet scent lingers forever in my nostrils, comforting my whole body. I cannot forget that April day with its gentle breeze. It was a myth, a long and melodious love song.</p>
<p>When the sky was piled high with clouds of purplish bronze, and the ground was adorned with lush green grass, two children ran out of their homes without restraint, running from the fields to the water's edge, where they rested. The water's edge was covered with thousands of yellow wildflowers and scarlet azaleas. Cuckoos sang of the rich wheat harvest in the fields. Separated only by a shallow stream, one could hear the sound of fishermen splashing water with their spears and casting their nets. In the setting sun, the green mountains took on a touch of purple. It was extremely pleasant to have two children pouring out their innocent and mysterious souls in this environment. Their clear laughter and the natural world formed a single pulse. Those two children were me and Caiqing.</p>
<p>"So, if Auntie wants to marry you off, what will you do?"</p>
<p>"That doesn't matter. I've already agreed to her."</p>
<p>"But you'll have to raise children, and you'll be beaten by your in-laws, understand?"</p>
<p>Hearing these words, she turned her head and said, "I'm not afraid."</p>
<p>"My mom also wants to find me a wife, saying I'm too young, not yet..."</p>
<p>The two children talked tirelessly, exchanging all sorts of conversations about themselves and their future happiness. "The future" was like an extremely magnificent drawing in front of us, a radiant glow of colorful clouds. Hope filled everyone's hearts, just as fruits and grains filled the granaries. In our dreams, a long period of days slipped by. At that time, she was still sixteen years old, and I was studying. A year later, she got married. She began to embark on the endless arduous path of life, like a traveler walking a long way, even her last shadow disappearing into the darkness. I haven't seen her since. I have been using fatigue and endurance to pass my years. That's how I spent many years.</p>
<p>Like swallows in spring, we met again this year. She was yellow and haggard, like a middle-aged woman. With her were a group of cumbersome children and a thin husband. In just a few years, time had relentlessly sculpted her into another statue, all stiff and prosaic. The impression she gave me was of dusk, an uninhabited temple, outdated newspapers, a lonely autumn garden. Facing this vulgarized shell, I was astonished by the dramatic changes that had occurred in the past few years. I couldn't believe my own eyes. I thought of the dreams of the past, the poetic longing for marriage, the beautiful spring fields, the sound of cuckoos echoing on the mountain cliffs and water's edge, and the small mountain flowers. Finally, these things quickly collapsed, and a dark fog covered all my fantasies...</p>
<p>We spent an afternoon in the park. Spring had already passed, and the sun was unbearably scorching. The wilderness only showed a dreary green color. As we walked over a small bridge, a withering flower fell onto my shoulder, into my sleeve. Finally, I brushed it off onto the ground with my handkerchief...</p>
<p>"That's a withered flower!" I said quietly.</p>
<p>Her face looked a little strange. She said, "This is just like, a person..." She didn't finish the second half of the sentence.</p>
<p>I also had nothing to say. I only looked at the flower once. The flower had already been engulfed by the dark soil.</p>
<h3 id="e208">Family Letter <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>— Tianzhen</p>
<p>Who says "A letter from home is worth ten thousand gold?"! As for me, I feel a kind of terror, as afraid of it as of a ferocious tiger. Yet the cover is clearly adorned with the claw marks of my nurturer. The unkempt merchant's handwriting is so familiar to me, so intimate, and two years of longing wind around me, tempt me. Finally, I couldn't help but tremble as I tore it open.</p>
<p>Nothing surprises me at all. My nerves seem to have been tamed by the surprising things that the era has refined. Emotions are burned into ashes and seeped into the dust of the universe. Even if a towering stone mountain collapsed on my mind, it wouldn't seem to stir up the slightest ripple. As numb as a stubborn stone! That's what I thought.</p>
<p>However, no, I also know very clearly: two sheets of eight-line paper are a sketch of family affairs over two years. A few brief strokes are so profound, so lifelike, so sad and moving. But I feel that I still have a bit of the primitive numbness; otherwise, how could I even cherish my tears of blood, unwilling to shed a single drop?</p>
<p>However, I also remember very clearly: an autumn evening two years ago, my father's face, making one's tears fall for three days.</p>
<h2>Page 19</h2>
<p>It was the first time we had met in six years. He looked at me with a stunned expression, and I also had the sincerity of "laughingly asking, where do you come from?". Each of us wisely touched the other's soul. Only then did he begin to ask with a stranger's air:</p>
<p>"I'm old! I didn't expect that we father and son would have a chance to meet!"</p>
<p>He narrowed his eyes, and several rainbows hung diagonally on the green edge of his pupils. With dew-like moistness, they reached his shriveled, blackened lower lip.</p>
<p>A breath of mint slowly spread across my heart. The path of words was blocked by clear tears. A son's aging is not easily spoken by a father, oh! That "old" word carrying ten million pounds, made all the hairs on my body fall upside down, and the brain cells exceeded the weight of my whole body!</p>
<p>"You're even more aged!" I became as terrified as if I were about to be executed by a blade.</p>
<p>In more than sixty years of the journey of life, his history had his golden age, the time when he sat at the exchange, the time when he operated two storefronts, the time when he manipulated finance. His plump physique symbolized his smooth path in the world. People envied the "God of Wealth", followed him, and longed for him. He was able to show a unique alertness and decisiveness in everything. He did not expect that a desolate shadow would envelop his old age! Mentioning the creation of his later history, he seemed to grieve for himself for no reason. Because of this, I am even more frightened that my sins will never be redeemed. The son, he, like ordinary people, had great fantasies. For these fantasies, he once cherished me with rare passion, irrigated me, until now he has fallen into the eyes of the world, but still retains his original foolish energy. Standing in front of him, can I still have the qualification to be high-spirited?</p>
<p>The words seemed to have been completely answered and concluded from the intersecting lines of sight: I had an awkward appearance, and he had a withered leaf-like face intertwined with sorrow and joy.</p>
<p>In the evening, he stayed in my small room, which cost eight silver dollars a month, and slept on the same bed.</p>
<p>As usual, even friends should exchange a few pleasantries in a silent face-to-face, but precisely because they are friends, there is the mood for pleasantries. At present, pressing on each other's mood is a strand of inexplicable sadness. No one needs to say anything, as if a layer of forbidden net has been laid down in front of them; they silently wait for the sleeping devil to swallow up each person's sensitivity and wit.</p>
<p>However, the sleeping devil is not as kind as we imagined—a single quilt suddenly became huge. I reached out and touched it, and my father's feet were exposed outside. I immediately understood that my father still had the same mentality as before: fearing that I would catch a cold, he let me cover myself more. I covered his feet with the quilt, and he seemed uncomfortable. After a while, he gently turned over, as if afraid of disturbing me, and his hand touched from my ankle to my upper thigh. Releasing his hand, he let out a sigh of heartache that I had heard often at home, and there seemed to be a muttering sound from his mouth.</p>
<p>"Dad, is the bed too narrow? Is it uncomfortable to sleep?" I asked what was wrong.</p>
<p>"It's not that! I felt only a few bones left on your thigh! Buy some ginseng to eat!"</p>
<p>After a moment of heartache, I prepared to say: We don't even have food to eat, and you want to eat ginseng! But I was afraid of hurting his heart, and in the end, I dared not say it. Deception is an unforgivable sin, but stimulating his pain with the truth is also a kind of cruelty. In the end, I could only say, "Yes, yes, yes," to appease his wishes.</p>
<p>Now that I have read his letter, his silver beard and withered leaf face have surfaced in my mind again. I wish I could tear it and my heart to pieces together.</p>

<h3 id="e221">Projected Number of Cars Made in the US This Year <a href="#e221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>— Yu</p>
<p>The Factory Target is Three and a Half Million Vehicles; New Cars for Next Year Will Debut Early in November</p>
<p>American automakers recently reviewed the national car production volume for the first quarter of this year. The number of cars manufactured by various factories reached 1,000,000 vehicles. By the third quarter of this year, in the first six months, American car production should reach at least 2,000,000 vehicles. The automakers' target for the whole year's production volume is 3,500,000 vehicles, or even more. In terms of quantity, the second quarter should be greater than the first quarter. For the remaining period, it will continue according to President Roosevelt's plan. All the new cars of 1936 will debut about two months early, which will have a significant impact on the increase in the annual production volume. The original intention of this plan is to allow workers to obtain more work throughout the twelve months. The date of the new car launch will be moved from January 1st to November 1st. The heads of various companies also mostly advocate advancing the auto show to early November. The New York Auto Show is also planned to be hosted by the companies to replace the one initiated by the sales agents in 1935.</p>
<p>Whether the automotive industry can reach the target of 5,500,000 vehicles is uncertain, and avoiding major delays is essential. Car body and parts manufacturing are not currently caught in the vortex of strikes. Other departments are often threatened by strikes due to worker agitation. The Akron plant's tire department is also in danger of shutting down. Recent reports indicate that the upcoming eight-day work system tends to be postponed. During this period, elections are being held at the Goodyear, Firestone, and Goodrich plants.</p>
<p>In the first three months of this year, in the production of over 1,000,000 cars, Chrysler's five products, Plymouth, DeSoto, Dodge, Chrysler, and Fargo, reached a total of 249,064 units for both passenger cars and trucks, which is an unprecedented achievement for the factory. During this quarter, Plymouth shipped a total of 136,040 units. The factories in Detroit and Los Angeles are manufacturing approximately 2,000 cars per day.</p>
<p>In the General Motors division, Pontiac's quarterly output was 51,809 passenger cars. The output for February was 17,802 units. The factory's production plan for April has reached 19,000 units. Walter P. Chrysler's production by March 30 totaled 44,441 units. This number is the highest record for the factory's output, so the weekly production volume has reached 4,500 vehicles.</p>
<p>After a year of organizational effort, the Society of Automotive Engineers has developed a new standard for the steel used in automobile manufacturing to "match" the specialized uses of automobiles. To accomplish this task, 29 metallurgical experts, representatives from factories related to steel and automobile manufacturing, collaborated and studied each other.</p>
<p>Export department staff members of the factories belonging to the American Automobile Manufacturers Association recently held a regular meeting in New York to discuss the expansion of overseas sales. Among them, Mr. Bowie, a long-time overseas representative of the American automotive industry, reported on the issue of tax reduction for American car exports, and that reciprocity arrangements have been negotiated with seventeen foreign countries. Bowie also said that the government has reached an understanding with the Belgian authorities that American cars imported into that country will be subject to a 15% reduction in the existing tax rate. When this is implemented, there will be opportunities for three other countries to reduce taxes on American-made cars. The United States will also similarly reduce tax rates on imports from these countries in exchange. Other countries still under negotiation include Italy, Sweden, Canada, some Central American republics, and Haiti. Some foreign countries have a clause on American car imports that all American cars transported by ship must be shipped in boxes. This regulation affects the cost of transporting cars from the factory to the port, increasing it by about 13%. Bowie and his collaborators are currently working to change this regulation so that cars not packaged can also be accepted for transportation by shipping companies.</p>
<h3 id="e222">The First Marius Arriving in Shanghai Seventeen Years Ago <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>— Fu</p>
<p>The Machinery is Still Excellent and Intact</p>
<p>The date of the first Marius car arriving in Shanghai was actually seventeen years ago. At that time, the Central Garage accepted the car as it was the Marius dealer at the time. This car is still running normally today. The machinery is still excellent and intact, without any flaws. Mr. Greenback, the business manager of Ardian Trading Co., Ltd., said to people after the first batch of new Marius cars arrived in Shanghai: "Let us look at the amazing effectiveness of this first Marius, the strong sales in Shanghai after its debut, the enthusiastic welcome from the people of Shanghai, and the urgent need for it. We can know that the business policy that Marius has set is well-considered and impeccable." In these seventeen years, although the automotive industry has undergone various changes, Marius still insists on the basic conditions that it set when it first manufactured the first car. According to the founder of Marius, the purpose of manufacturing cars is to ensure that car owners do not waste a single penny and can enjoy extreme reliability. They believe that to achieve this kind of reliability, it is necessary to have sound design, excellent material selection, and sophisticated technology. Having clearly identified the goal and being able to persevere, its products are the same as the first Marius. The service is absolutely satisfactory, and the life span is doubled. The so-called maintenance and operation can obtain the greatest service at the lowest cost.</p>
<h3 id="e223">Dodge's Old Workers Participate in the Ceremony for the Three Millionth Dodge Car to Leave the Factory <a href="#e223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>According to the well-known manager of Dodge cars in Shanghai, China Motor Corporation, the company recently received news from the factory that the three millionth Dodge car was completed the other day. At the time, more than 20 old workers who were initially hired by the factory and have been there ever since participated in the ceremony. Most of them have silver hair, but their spirits are very energetic. They were all excited and comforted by the birth of this car. Because they had personally built the first Dodge more than 20 years ago, and now they have witnessed the birth of the three millionth car, which is excellent and reliable, and has reached the realm of perfection, their heartfelt joy is multiplied compared to ordinary people. The average age of these old workers is 66 years old, and their average years of service is 23 and a half years. When the first Dodge was assembled, only 12 people participated, but within a week, the number increased to 100, and the output reached 25 vehicles per day. Today, 20 years later, the output of Dodge passenger cars alone has reached 1,000 vehicles per day, and about 25,000 employees are employed. The picture above is the three millionth Dodge.</p>
<h3 id="e224">Economical Use of Storage Batteries <a href="#e224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>— Ren</p>
<p>The importance of storage batteries in the automotive industry is beyond doubt. Everyone acknowledges it. But how to use a storage battery so that it lasts a long time without being damaged is a major issue from an economic point of view. If the following points are paid attention to, the problem of economical use will not be difficult to solve.</p>
<p>(1) Charging must follow the specified rate. The standard specified time for ordinary lead-acid batteries is eight hours. If charging can be done according to this specified time, the battery's efficiency and effective life will definitely achieve good results. In addition, faster or slower is not appropriate, especially faster is the most harmful. Because the time is short, if you still want to reach a certain amount of power storage (ampere-hours), the number of amperes of current must be increased. As a result, the released bubbles are both fast and numerous, and the temperature rises, so that the effective material does not have time to adhere to the lead sheet and is inadvertently left at the bottom of the battery, causing a short circuit. The extent of the danger is not difficult to imagine.</p>
<p>(2) Electrolyte specific gravity limit. No matter what the degree of charging or discharging, it can be measured with a hydrometer. During charging, the specific gravity of the electrolyte is between 1.200 and 1.300. During discharging, the specific gravity of the electrolyte must not exceed 1.170.</p>
<p>(3) Do not overcharge. Under the specified charging rate, whether the battery's charging level is satisfactory can be determined by the following three methods.</p>
<p>First. The battery voltage does not increase within one hour.</p>
<p>Second. A large number of bubbles are generated between the two poles of the battery, like boiling.</p>
<p>Third. The specific gravity of the electrolyte remains conservative within one hour, without increase or decrease.</p>
<p>(4) Do not over-discharge. Over-discharge can cause the amount of lead sulfate precipitated to increase sharply. However, because lead sulfate is a poor conductor, the internal resistance increases and the voltage decreases. Eventually, the sulfuric acid also suddenly hardens, causing the main objects in the battery to collapse and fall off. Therefore, the ills of over-discharge must be carefully avoided. Under the specified discharge rate, ordinary batteries should stop discharging when the voltage drops to 1.750 volts. (Continued on page 10)</p>

<p>(5) The electrolyte must be pure. The sulfuric acid and distilled water used in the electrolyte should be as pure as possible to obtain the highest efficiency. Impure electrolytes, such as those containing other metal impurities, etc., if accumulated on the electrode plates, will have a local effect on the lead plates, consuming a lot of electrical energy, which is not suitable for economic use.</p>
<p>(6) Pay attention to the positive and negative poles of the power supply when charging. If the positive and negative poles of the power supply are not clearly marked, it is easy to make mistakes. If you are not careful and make a mistake, not only will it not be able to charge, but it will also cause the lead sulfate to harden and other main objects to collapse and fall off. A simple method for testing the positive and negative poles of the power supply is to take a bottle of diluted salt water and pass the positive and negative poles of the power supply through it. The pole that can generate bubbles in the salt water is undoubtedly the cathode.</p>
<p>(7) Storage method when the battery is not in use. If the battery is not in use, it must be fully charged before being stored. The location should also be cool and dry. If the electrolyte is slightly reduced due to evaporation, distilled water should be added to replenish it. Make sure that the electrolyte level is about half an inch above the top of the electrode plates.</p>
