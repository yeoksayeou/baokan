<h3 id="c20">學生運動之復興 <a href="#c20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>— 秉</p>
<p>九日上午。北平各大學學生數千人向何應欽請願。提出保障華北安全。維護國家權利等口號。市民亦多參加。民氣極為激昂。當憤激塡膺忠悃欲迸之今日。國人讀此新聞。宜莫不有鬱結略宣之感。雖警察憲兵加以勸阻。未免使參加者稍感不快。然此不足介意。警察憲兵第知維持秩序。職資攸在。勸阻亦固其所。學生市民以及全國民衆宜諒此意也。</p>
<p>夫學生之本務。在專心向學。此係天經地義。無可駁詰。亦猶工人之本務。在勞力製作。商人之本務。在貿遷有無。苟不專心於此。卽為荒棄職責。然於本務以外。凡有係於生活之事項。亦豈不容置念。國家者。民眾所託命。在此疆彼界分別至嚴之現代。國家觀念尤與生活有深切之關係。方國家見侵於强力。將瀕於危殆。凡有血氣。咸知卽己身之命運已臨險境。於是焦心勞思。務謀從萬死以求一生。是豈出位旁騖。亦欲自爭生存而已。若責以舍棄本務。則對曰。事務緊急。有不容專心本務者矣。此言也。其聲至悽慘。其意至痛苦。茍有人心。當不以詭辯視之。今北平學生處聞見較切之地。感深切肌膚之痛。好整以暇。專心向學。已不能守此雅度。遂起而請願。一吐心聲。警覺同氣。其舉動之宜受深諒。固不待智者而知之。且裏懷一念。亟欲披宣者。豈惟北平學生。巡於市壓。訪諸里巷。咸聞此切切之聲矣。特未有結隊游行之大舉耳。是則謂北平學生代表全國民衆而為宣言可也。</p>
<p>試觀北平學生所提出之口號。日保障華北安全。曰維護國家權利。實為我國民衆最低限度之要求。華北係中國人之華北。國家係中國人之國家。保障之。維護之。猶私家自保其財產。絕無背於所有權之通義。亦不違夫睦邦論之要旨。苟此最低限度之要求而猶不容蓄之於心。出之於口。見之於事實。則我國民衆亦惟有不惜犧牲。以為最後之掙扎耳。且我國民衆之所要求者。重實際而不取虛名。曰保障。必須眞得保障。曰維護。必須眞能維護。若如文人行文。僅取「保障」「維護」為題目而敷衍文飾之。按諸事實。乃相去遠甚。是仍未足以屬我國民衆之願望。此為該口號中應有之含義。特為伸說。以便共曉。</p>
<p>復次。學生運動絕響已數年矣。其所以絕響之故。姑不深論。總之。學生運動足以官導鬱結。激發民氣。要非無裨實際討厭可憎之舉。卽如今茲之役。發生於學生運動最有歷史關係之北平。宣示民意。標舉簡要。俾强力者知我國民衆之未可重侮。而外交家亦未嘗不可倚為周旋折衝之後盾。近來朝野方交口主張尊重言論自由。我人以為此一自由。似亦宜在不越軌道之範圍內。受相當之尊重也。</p>

<h3 id="c106">義務教育　（一） <a href="#c106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>— 敎育部普通敎育司司長顧樹森</p>
<p>今天我講的題目是「義務敎育」</p>
<p>在我沒有講述以前，先請大家想一想，「甚麽呌做義務敎育」</p>
<p>所謂義務敎育的意義，就是國家用法律來規定，凡是人民對於自己的子女或者地所保護的兒童，在相當年齡期內，有絕對使他們受相當時期敎育的義務，這就呌做義務敎育。這種法律規定人民對於子女必須使他受敎育的義務，如果不能遵守，政府得依法强制執行，所以這種義務敎育，又稱强迫敎育。</p>
<p>我們想，國家為甚麼要用法律來規定使人民對於子女在一定的年歲以內，都要受相當的敎育呢？我想這個意思，大家都能懂得，就是因為人們受了敎育，知識才能够豐富，思想才能够敏捷，判斷事理才能够正確，懂得禮貌，懂得做人的道理人格才能够高尙，人們在小時候，都受了相當的敎育，長大起來，自然會有職業，生活方面，旣然有了相當的職業，自然安分守己，不致於作惡，那末社會上就可以减少不良的分子，社會因此得以安定，並且一個國家的敎育普及了，人民知識自然增高，社會事業自然發達，國家那有不富强的道理呢？總之要求人民知識進步，社會事業發達，秩序安定，以至於國家富强，全靠從推行義務敎育做起，所以世界文明國家都要用法律來規定强迫人民對於子女使他受相當的敎育。</p>
<p>照前面所說：義務敎育旣是人民對於國家應盡的一種義務，並且無分貧育，無分智愚，都應該使他受平等的敎育，但是敎育的範圍很廣，從幼稚園起，以至於小學，中學，推而至大學，人人都應該有享受敎育的機會，那來對於義務敎育的範圍，似乎决不能限於小學了，關於這一點，我們假使單從敎育械會均等來說，以至於敎育對於社會國家的利益來說，當然義務敎育的範圍，擴充得越大越好，但是施行全國各級敎育，需要極大的經費，便使　務敎育的範圍擴大，所需的經費，當然也要加多。所以國家用法律來規定義務敎育的範圍，第—個條件，必須審察國家和人民的經濟能力如何而定的，又因為義務敎育的範圍如果要擴大，兒童在校受敎育的年期，當然也要加長，假使國內一般人民的生活狀况很是困苦，那裏能够使子弟有很長的時期來受敎育呢？所以規定義務敎育範圍的第二個條件，必須審査社會和人民的生活狀况如何而定的，除了這兩個條件以外，推行義務敎育的範圍，起先不但要定得很小很低，還應該把年限定得很短，以後等得施行有了相當的效果，然後遂漸把範圍推廣，年限加長。考査世界各國推行義務敎育的成績，在起初的時間有的都是從很短的年限做起，年限長的，結果反推行得慢，年限短的，遂漸加長，結果反快。總之，施行義務敎育，必須有相當歷史，然後方可把敎育程度逐漸提高，年限逐漸加長，這是規定義務敎育範圍的第二個條件。</p>
<p>現在可以把世界各國的義務敎育概况略為報吿，以備參考比較：</p>
<p>德國是實行義務敎育最早的國家，他們在一六一九年，就有一個伐愛瑪爾市，發出强迫市民令子弟入學的命令了。後來戈塔布薩克森·擺倫·巴登各地方，都先後倣行起來·到了一七六三年，那時的普王呌做斐特利，打勝了法國和奧國他知道强迫敎育是很重要的，就明白規定强迫就學辦法，凡是普魯士的人民，自五歲起至十三四歲以內，有不遵照命令不上學的，就要罰他們的父兄或保護人。德國的實施義務敎育，就可以說在遭時候成立了。到得一八五一年，復在憲法內正式規定。他們所定義務敎育年限是八年，所用的義務敎育經費，地方自籌約佔十分之八，政府補助約佔十分之二，到了歐戰以後，政府改組，地方稅取消，統改為國稅，由是所有義務敎育經費，都由國家負擔了：他們的義務敎育發展的程度，因為歷史已久，現在可說已經達到極點，人人都受到了敎育。但是檢査他們過去的統計：在一八九四年時。他們施行義務敎育最遠的地方，也已有四十年的歷史了，可是那時全國入學學齡兒童數的統計，僅僅達到百分之三十三，我們再來細細想想，這一點就可以證明義務敎育的年限定得太長，實施的效果就要比較遲緩了。</p>
<p>法國實施義務敎育的動機，在一七九二年就已經發動了，最初定强迫就學的年限為三年到了一八八七年，給普魯打得大敗以後，復正式規定强迫辦法，凡六歲至十三歲的兒童，一律須受强迫敎育，並且免除學費，從此以後，他們的義務敎育更加完備了。到了歐戰以後，復把就學年限改為八年。他們的義務敎育經費，從一八八二年起，所有小學敎員的薪俸，完全歸中央擔任的，各地方所負擔的，不過學校修理和學生的用品等零星費用。他們對於義務敎育的設施，也可以算得努力極了。但是不識字的人，據結婚註册簿中以記號代簽字的，尙屬不少，也可以知道他們的義務敎育，尙展沒有達到最高的程度。</p>
<p>英國的義務敎育情形，向來偏於自由還發，所以私立學校非常發達，到了一八七〇年，才制定實行强迫敎育的法律，義務敎育的統制實行，也可以說是這個時候才開始。他們的義務敎育就學年限，從歐戰以後，確定為九年。中央負擔的義務敎育經費，到了歐戰以後，也增加建到二分之一，其餘二分之一仍歸地方負擔。他們規定的義務敎育年限，雖然很長，併且統制强迫的實行也是很遲，可是過去的敎育發展，基礎很固，所以到了現在，九年的義務敎育，也可說是普及了。</p>
<p>美國的義務敎育，最初有麻薩朱塞司省的人民，自動規定做父母的有使子弟入學的義務，到了一八二五年才經法令規定，推行全省，後來各省先後倣行，據一九二七年的調査，已有二十省了。他們的義務敎育年限，各省不等，最多數的是從七歲主十六歲止，亦有幾省僅不過五年，現在全國的入學兒童數，平均統計，入學兒童巳達到學齡兒童百分之九十四，他們的義務敎育經費，各省政府担任百分之二十到六十不等，中央政府也把大宗官荒地畝給予地方做義務敎育的基金。</p>
<p>日本在一八七二年起實行强迫敎育，他們的學制規定，人口滿六百，設一小擊區，六歲以上的兒童都要入學，是全國同時實行的，他們的義務敎育經費，一向完全歸地方政府負擔的，到了大正七年起，才由中央撥費補助。他們規定的義務敎育受敎育年限是六年，但是在起初十餘年內，兒童每年就學僅僅四個月，等到滿足十六個月，就可認為受敎育年限巳經終了。後來再把每年在學的日期逐漸增長，到了明治三十三年以後才一律須滿足四年。</p>
<p>前面所說各國實施義務敎育的情形雖僅五國，但是已足使我們知道急切推行義務敎育的重要。我們應該大家都來深切地想一想，我們為甚麼要急切的推行義務敎育，關於這方面，也得約略的說一說：</p>
<p>第一，我國中華民族雖然領有很大的羣衆，很久的歷史，可是也許因為地大物傳，‘山川阻隔的關係，不獨一省有一省的風俗，習慣，語言，甚而至於一縣一地方，也有一縣一地方的風俗，習慣，語言，無怪人民漸漸的分析離散，竟好像一盤散沙，難於團結。要想補救這個弊病，使全國民族團結一致，復興我們固有的民族精神，惟有推行義務敎育，增高民族的意識，改良閉塞的風俗，革除不良的習慣，統一不同的語言，以造成堅實團結的大中華民族，這是急切需要推行義務敎育的第一點。</p>
<p>第二，我們檢査最近的敎育統計，就可以知道不識字的竟佔全人口百分之八十以上，入學兒童數僅及學童數百分之二十三我們想，這許多不識字的民衆，要訓練他們行使四權，養成他們的政治能力，預備做公民的資格巳是很難，而未來的不識字民衆又聽憑他一大批一大批的產生出來，這是何等可怕，所以急切去推行義務教育，培養未來健全的人民，養成他們做公民的資格，實在是治本的工作，</p>
<p>第三，看到國內各地生產衰落，農村破產，民生窮困的景象，尤其覺得十二分的危懼，我們假使用敎育的眼光去觀察其所以逮到這種景象的根本原因，都是因為敎育不普及，以致人民的生產技能不能改進，被外國的經濟侵略，就此到不可收拾的局面，所以目前的救念計劃雖然不可不籌，但是治本的方法，全靠着敎育的力量去補救，照這樣看來，推行義務敎育，實在急切需要呢，</p>
<p>前間所說的三點，就是我們急切需要推行義務敎育的重大原因，還有要報　我國推行義務敎育的經過情形，本年度各省市實施義敎狀况，以及推行義務敎育的意見，下次冉講。</p>

<p>（上海工商業槪况之五）　中國徵信所主編</p>
<p>一，上海肥皂製造業之發展</p>
<p>碱質能去汚除垢，我國先民及今之僻鄉農婦，常利用稻草餘燼，或由皂莢所搗成之莢塊，以供洗滌，即因其中含有咸質之故。海通之後，國人皆趨用洋皂，蓋洋皂係按科學方法製造，除含較完善之碱質之外，尙含有某種動物油或植物油，故除垢力量較大，且不若草燼皂莢之易損衣服，然海外肥皂，遂因此而長驅直人矣。</p>
<p>最初輸入我國之洋皂，為禮和皂，近年來外貨祥茂北忌兩牌，亦盛銷市上，其間英日資本更相繼來滬設廠製造，直接推銷本埠及內地，金圖包攬我國之肥皂市塲。民國紀元前二年（一九一〇年）成立之上海油脂株式會社（日商），及紀元前一年成立之中國肥皂有限公司（英商），即為當時崛起之兩大勢力，迄至今日，仍不失為滬上肥皂業之覇者。</p>
<p>按肥皂製造業雖為化學工業之一種，但以其非屬化學原料之製迭，乃僅將已成之化學半製品重加配置而已，技術並不繁複，所需資本亦可大可小，故當海外洋皂輸入不久，英日資本在華培植基礎之際，華商起而仿製者，亦相當有人，如華商董甫卿，在上海閘北創立裕茂皂廠，為我國皂廠之鼻祖，繼起者有民元之怡茂，民二之南陽·立大·鼎豐各廠。今將上海新創之華商皂廠，按年列表如次：</p>
<p>年別　廠數</p>
<p>民元至民五　六家</p>
<p>民十一至十五　七家</p>
<p>民廿一至廿四　三家</p>
<p>上半年</p>
<p>年別　廣數</p>
<p>民六至民十　三家</p>
<p>民十六至二十　四家</p>
<p>前表係根據現存並加入同業公會之廠家計算，其中途閉歇或未加入公會者，皆不在內，故實際廠家之數目當較前表所列稍多，藝僅就現存而未加入公會之廠家而言，即有十家左右故也。統觀滬上華商皂廠，不可謂不多，但因資本微小，製造技術又類多手工，與外商言競爭，尙甚困難，又近數年來，滬上皂業，亦在不景氣中，當一二八事件發生之際，直接被毀或間接受影饗而閉歇者，前後共有六家。嗣後軍事之浩刦雖過，而經濟恐慌之惡運依然未除，收縮者時有所聞，宜如何團結圖存，以打開目前之難關，亦肥皂業所應共勉者也。</p>
<p>二，上海中外各皂廠之槪况</p>
<p>上海華商肥皂製造廠，據本所最近調査所得，目下尙存者共有三十餘家，其中加入同業公會（該業公會於民十七年冬成立）者凡二十四家，今將其廠名，資本及產額等情况，列表如左，以便參攷：</p>
<p>廠名　設立　資本　全年產額（單位箱）　商標</p>

<p>裕茂皂廠　光緒三十三年　三千元　五，〇〇〇　雙喜·獅球·</p>
<p>怡茂皂廠　民國元年　五千元　一〇，〇〇〇　象頭·天字·旗牌</p>
<p>立大皂廠　民國二年　一萬元　一五，〇〇〇　立大·天官·塔山</p>
<p>南陽燭皂廠　民國二年　六萬元　六五，〇〇〇　南陽·寶光·地球·電燈·</p>
<p>光華化學工藝社　民國十六年　一萬二千元　五，〇〇〇　金龍·</p>
<p>遠東燭皂廠　民國二十年　七千元　一二，〇〇〇　魚·</p>
<p>隆盛皂廠　民國十三年　三千元　四，〇〇〇　——</p>
<p>永和實業公司　民國六年　六千七百元　三，〇〇〇　永字·月裏嫦娥·</p>
<p>公茂皂廠　民國十三年　五千五百元　六，〇〇〇　——</p>
<p>祥民皂廠　民國十三年　五千元　四，〇〇〇　祥民·鑽石·祥新·唯一·</p>
<p>福昌皂廠　民國十在年　一千元　二，〇〇〇　——</p>
<p>華昌皂廠　民國三年　五千元　五，〇〇〇　金福·鷄鹿·</p>
<p>震記皂廠　民國十三年　一千元　二，〇〇〇　——</p>
<p>信華皂廠　民國十四年　四千元　一二，〇〇〇　月光·電光　雙船·</p>
<p>大德皂廠　民國十六年　五千元　二〇，〇〇〇　亞光·</p>
<p>中和皂廠　民國二十二年　一萬元</p>
<p>亞洲皂廠　民國二十一年　一萬元　五，〇〇〇　三五·鐘裝·寶塔·青光·愛國·</p>
<p>廣通肥皂公司　民國十九年　四萬元　——　連環·</p>
<p>無敵香皂廠　民國二十四年　五萬元　——　胡蝶·</p>
<p>按前表觀察，華廠中資本最大者為五洲固本皂藥廠，計三十萬元，其次為南陽，無敵，廣通，中央四家，計四萬至六萬不等，此外皆為萬元或數千元之小廠，然即就五洲而言，若與在滬外廠相較，蓋英商中國肥皂公司一家之資本（計八百萬元），即超過前列二十五華廠資本之總數，無怪民族虫業，尙不能獨樹一幟而與外商抗衡也。在滬外廠為數不多，但資本皆極雄厚，其主要者如左、</p>
<p>一，中國肥皂有限公司，創辦年月及資本，前己言及，廠址在楊樹浦路二三一〇號，計有百餘畝之面積，其總公司設於外灘麥加利銀行大厦二樓，天津，南昌，厦門，瀋陽各大埠均設有分公司，該公司係由利華，和與，白禮氏及厚豐四家肥皂公司合併而成。規模極大，產品分家用皂及化妝皂兩種（以前者為主），牌號甚多，如力士香皂，利華藥皂，祥茂，北忌，日光等皆是。每日產量，僅家用皂一項，即達六七千箱，平均每年營業額可達一千萬元</p>
<p>二，上海油脂株式會社，該廠設立，更較中國皂廠早一年，建廠於毘明路，發行所則設於河南路（林寳洋行亦為其發行機關），資本額定五十萬元，實收二十五萬元，置有機器三十五台。雇工約有一百二十人，每年可出香皂一百萬打，油脂九十萬斤。</p>
<p>三，第一公司（又名第一工業製藥株式會社），係由日本總公司分來，於民國七年設立，廠址在河間路五十五號，佔面積約四畝餘，資本自去年以後，更攤充至日金一百萬元，實收六十二萬五千元，公積約日金二十寓元。該廠以製造並販賣工業用肥皂為主，每年可產肥皂八千六百四十箱，營業額年達日金二十萬元，其發行所設於密勒路三五五號。</p>
<p>三，製造肥皂之原料</p>
<p>製造肥皂之原料，主要即為堿與油兩種，至化妝皂則更需各種香料，惟所佔比重甚微。碱之種類甚多，主要可分純碱燒碱泡花碱三種，國產甚少，十九皆舶來品，今將最近四年純堿燒碱之進口量統計如次（單位海關金單位）：</p>
<p>廿一年　廿二年　廿三年　廿四年一月十月</p>
<p>純碱　一、六九一、五八一　一、一三五、八六七　一、一一五、〇二四　八七二、〇三六</p>
<p>燒碱　一、〇二六、七三三　一、四五、四七六　一、四三、二三六　一、〇九六、一三九</p>
<p>二十一年　全國　上海</p>
<p>家用及洗衣肥皂　一四七　四四</p>
<p>化妝者肥皂　五七八　二八二</p>
<p>註：單位一千海關金單位。</p>
<p>輸入額兩者皆趨下降，主要原因當係國內市况衰落，人民購買力减少之故，但家用皂三年間减少三分之二。而化妝皂少不過五分之一。即係製造家用皂之華廠。日臻發達之徵。此外就五洲固本皂與英商中國肥皂公司之祥茂皂競爭之結果觀之，其理亦頗均合。按五洲固本皂廠確於民十成立，但發達尙不過數載。民國十八年時，全年營業額尙不過二百餘萬元，二</p>
<p>該項化學碱料，平均百分之八十係來自英國，輸入於上海者約佔百分之四十。此項碱料，雖亦為製造玻璃及紙張等所必需，但已足見吾國民族肥皂業，在原料上尙如何仰賴於外。故欲圖該業之完全獨立，吾人尙需同時注意及此根本點也。</p>
<p>至於油質原料中植物油一項，如棉子油，柏油，漆油，豆油等，大體皆能自給有餘，蓋我國原為一農產國家，此項農產自然不需仰賴他國。柏油主要產地為鄂之荊州宜昌兩屬，及沿平漢路之麻城售價每担約一十一元左右。漆油主要產於湖北各地，性質堅粳，宜於凝結，故小廠常用之，價較柏油略賤一元。花生油以山東生產最多，年約一萬六七千萬担，皖粵次之，宜於製造軟性肥皂，每担約售十八元。他如物油中之羊油，多半產於西北各省，牛油則產於山東河南，惟魚油則購自日本。凡此各種原料，滬上皆有專門之商號或掮客，向各廠介紹推銷，如柏油皆由法租界新老永安街一帶之永茂祥，永興盛、程達記等店號經售，牛油則多由童泰昌，李裕盛，順利，允興等號。前述各種油價，一般言之，去年皆較低落，故各廠盈餘，頗有可觀；</p>
<p>四，肥皂業之前途</p>
<p>肥皂主要分家用皂及化妝皂二種，已如上述，化妝皂製造較難，技術比較幼稚之華廠，當不易與巴黎紐約之先進廠家競爭。同時享用是項化妝香皂者，多為上中階級，所費雖多，亦無大碍，且一般又常抱有崇洋心理，故惟有價昂之西洋貨方能投其所好。職是之故，民族化妝香皂業之發展，在舶來品之壓迫下，頗非易事。至家用肥皂，情形稍異，蓋其製造，較為簡易，而購用者又為一般平民，洋貨價貴，即不願購，故華廠倘能好自為之，則挽回漏巵，當非大難過去三年間，家用皂與化妝皂之輸入减少率，兩者顯有不同，計</p>
<p>二十二年</p>
<p>全國　上海</p>
<p>六九　三六</p>
<p>五〇七　三五八</p>
<p>二十三年</p>
<p>全國　上海</p>
<p>四九　二四</p>
<p>四八二　二七九</p>
<p>十二年以後，一躍而為三百餘萬元，全年盈餘更自二萬元突增至民國二十三之三十萬元，主要關鍵即係本埠祥茂銷路，已為固本所奪，祥茂雖迭次貶價傾銷，仍未能挽回額勢，故一切皆待吾人努力為之而已。據機聯會刋第一。九期所載，上海華廠所製之粗皂，其水份均較洋商所製者為少，而純皂量又較洋商為多，此種實質之改進，實為吾國民族皂業成功之基礎，今將其化騐結果，摘錄於次，以吿國人：</p>
<p>中外精皂化騐成份之比較</p>
<p>項目　祥茂皂　固本皂　南陽皂　太平洋皂　扇牌皂</p>
<p>水份　四八·〇三％　三三·〇〇％　三〇·五〇％　四〇·六〇％　二九·三七％</p>
<p>松香　八·一八％　八·九九％　一二·一七％　七·八〇％　六·四四％</p>
<p>總脂肪酸　四〇·六七％　五五·一九％　四九·七一％　四〇·四四％　四七·一二％</p>
<p>總碱量　六·八五％　九·一七％　八·九六％　八·三七％　七·三七％</p>
<p>純皂　四七·五二％　六四·三六％　五八·六六七％　四八·八一％　六〇·五九％</p>
<p>食鹽　〇·三五％　一·四〇％　〇·四〇％　〇·五四％　〇·四五％　〇·一七％</p>
<p>水玻璃　四·一〇％　一·二四％　三·二二％　五·一八％　五·四〇％</p>
<p>游離油　〇·六二％　〇·三九％　三·四〇％　〇·一八％</p>
<p>游離碱　〇·〇三％　〇·〇一％　〇·〇八％　〇·一六％　〇·五四％</p>
<p>甘油　四·〇五％　一·九五％　五·八六％　四·六七％　四·〇〇％</p>
<p>非皂物　九·七六％　三·九九％　一·一〇％　一一·六四％　一〇·一一％</p>
<p>惟目下各華廠資力有跟，產量不多，所出肥皂除銷本埠外，不能廣銷於內地各埠，故外廠出貨在華北華南以及長江上游，依然掌握霜權。深望各廠通力合作，改進出品，擴充產量，使全國國民，皆能用中國人自製之肥皂，對於國民經濟之復興，當有極大貢獻也。</p>

<h3 id="c183">改良中國樂器的問題　（一） <a href="#c183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>— 丁爕休</p>
<p>三四年前、國立音樂專科學校校畏蕭友梅先生在某一次的談話中間、向我提出了一個問題、他說西洋樂器中的長笛、價値非常昂貴、學生購置不易、能否將中國舊式的笛于、加以改良、使它能代替西洋的長笛、同時價値可以甚低、換句話說、即能否把中國的笛子變成一種「普羅」的西洋畏笛、我對於這個問題、立即感覺到很廣大的興趣、同時從這個問題、引起了兩個範圍較的問題、即（一）中國的樂器有無改良之必要與可能、（二）如果我們認為中國樂器應加改良、改良的方針、是否除了注意於學理及藝術方面、還應兼顧到普及的方面、</p>
<p>中國的音樂專家對於中國樂器的意見、我們見到的很少、從私人談話方面所得、似乎有兩種兩極端的見解、一種是認為中國樂器過於簡陋、過於狹隘、西洋的樂器種類旣多、品質又好、音樂固然是有民族性的、但樂器不妨公用、用了西洋的樂器、我們仍舊可以產生中國性的音樂、人家既然有現成的完美的工具、我們何必不完全接受、進一步說、西洋音樂的進化、是向着理想樂器方面進步的、中國的樂器如果加以改良、則不過逐漸變成西洋樂器而巳、更進一步說、中國樂器之所以成為中國樂器、或許就是因為它的簡陋、胡琴之所以成為胡琴、就是因為雜聲太多、古琴之所以為古琴、就是因為它的聲音剛低到聽不見」、（這是英人羅素對於中國古琴的描寫、）另一種見解、是認為中國的音樂原來是很發達的、如同一切其他的文明一樣、目前西洋所適用的平均十二律的音階組織、是中國人發明的、和聲是中國樂曲中一向就有的、樂器原來也是很發達的、到現在不過失傳而已·祇要我們肯到廢紙堆裏下工夫、中國音樂的復興、是不難實現的、進一步說、目前我們所有的中國樂器之中、也有不少的優良之品、笙·簫·笛·琵琶·古琴·都各有它的特色、如果存了西洋樂器的成見、妄加更改、比方說、將簫與古琴的音量加大、則所有這兩種樂器的精微奧妙之點、傷失盡矣、以上所說的兩種兩極端的見解、我們不敢說可以包括所有中國的音樂專家對於中　樂器的意見、但至少可以代表兩部分人的意見是毫無問題的、自然、第一種見解、多半是屬於研究西洋昔樂的人，第二種見解、多半是屬於研究中國音樂　人、</p>
<p>對於以上的兩種見解、以我們外行人看去、似乎都含有一部份極明顯的眞理、但同時都不無可疑之點、讓我們先就第一種見解來說、第一、樂器固然是一種工具、但同時各有它的個別的音色、如同食品是養生的質料、但各種人有各種人的口味、文字是表現思想的工具、但各種文字有各種文字的形式與構造、雖然對於文字方面、也有人主張廢漢字、改用羅馬字母、更有人主張盡廢現有的各種文字、改用世界語、對於食品方面、也好像有人相信應當廢除烹調、改用化學丸子但這完全是從功利一方面着想、做到做不到、應做應不做、當然還都成問題、若從享受一方面着想、則似乎欣賞文藝的人、最好是各種文字、皆能精通、愛好美味的人、最好是西餐中菜、龍井咖啡、兼而有之比較夾得滴意一點、然而這還是一種一視同仁的說法、其實一個民族、對於他固有的文字、口味、音樂、自然有養成的特殊的感覺、凡是在國外住過多年的人、大概都有過類似下述的一種經騐、在外國居住多年的人、每逢開同鄉會或同學會演奏音樂節目的時候、對於外國音樂、多多是恭而敬之的敬聆、一聽到中國的音調、即不期然的會眉飛色舞起來、這其中自然有不諳外國音樂與思鄉病的因素、但總不能說不是中國人對於本國音調一種天然的感應、</p>

<p>— Louisa　M．Alcott原著鄭曉滄譯</p>
<p>可是月亮的圓圓的臉兒，還沒探過山頂來打破她的好望，她却巳先自睡去，背靠着高大鳳尾草所成的小茆亭，巳深深入於黑甜的夢境，裏面見到許多游火蟲，藍色的裙子，滿坑滿谷的苺實，還有羅勃是在抹去一僩黑母牛的眼淚，它却是在哭訴道：「我要回家去！我要回家去！</p>
<p>〇〇〇〇〇〇〇〇〇〇〇〇</p>
<p>孩子們旣已睡去，隣近蚊市的嗡嗡又助使深深入夢，他們家裏却巳驚惶得很了。那乾草車於五點鍊到了，其餘的人都巳準時到了柵欄邊等待，只有解客，愛彌，南恩和羅勃未見到來。這次趕車的不是賴司務而是拂朗，等到童子們告訴他別人巳從森林裏歸家了，他露出不悅之色說道：「他們得留出羅勃，讓他坐車回去，他走得遠路要乏極了。」</p>
<p>「那條路短些，他們並員會肩着他走的，」太腓說道，他急切想吃他的晚餐。</p>
<p>「你們確實知道南恩羅勃係和他們同去的嗎？」</p>
<p>「當然是的；我看見他們爬過那垜牆頭，唱着那已是五點鐘了，解客並且喊着他們要走另一條路回家了，」韜摩又解說道。</p>
<p>「那末最好，大家一起來罷，」於是那柴車，載了疲倦的孩子們和許多滿滿的手桶，磔格磔格回去了。</p>

<p>兩雄相遇必有劇戰</p>
<p>—昨晚約翰勝兩星—</p>
<p>西靑籃球賽、今晚有甲組兩塲、七時三刻之麥令斯對海賊一賽、競爭必有可觀、歷年來兩隊勢不兩立、為爭奪錦標之兩主角、但本季麥令實力稍遜、曾一度敗於協興、今晚與海賊狹路相逢、以形勢觀之、似難有所作為也、茲將今晚秩序列下</p>

<p>稅專勝慕爾（乙）</p>
<p>第一幕乙組賽、稅專對慕爾、實力不相上下、稅專因聯絡較佳、籃下短傳、活潑可取、一路領前、慕爾於落後數分間緊隨、張良雄每以遠射獲分、上半時打成二十二對十七、下半時中、慕爾一度、追成二十三對二十六、相差僅三分、但入後稅專又形得勢、節節投中、最後結果為三十六對二十六、稅專勝利、</p>

<p>甲組賽約翰戰南星、賽來勢均力敵、前十分鐘內、分數忽起忽落、造成緊張局面、約翰先由馬芳粹連進二球、聲勢喧赫一時、但不旋踵閒、南星一鼓作氣、程文鍔、劉量鋒接連投中、即以十一對八超出、約翰努力加鞭、迭有佳美之演出、南星守衛略一鬆懈、即被約翰源源投中、未幾即成二十七對十五、遙居上風、南星忽起直追、上半時打成二十二對二十九、下半時開始時、南星氣焰萬丈、守衛嚴密、前鋒活躍、周恕安一連投中數球、突以三十二對三十一再度超出、在此緊要關頭、約翰賴張世榮、童過春之投中、挽回頹勢、始撥雲霧以見天日、許文奎在敵籃下屢顯其猛捷之身手、分數扶搖直上、最後結果、為五十一對四十一之比、南星力竭而敗、</p>

<h3 id="c210">冬之味 <a href="#c210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>— （花鈴）</p>
<p>—冬憶到了人間—</p>
<p>淡淡的太陽光中，微微地，有時發狂也似的怒吼着西北風，這便是季節的輪子，已輾進了年中最後一季了。</p>
<p>「冬」，在有錢人瞧來，雖沒有春那麽的迷人，也沒有秋那麽的明爽，但所苦者，就不過是寒冷的空氣而巳。但是出進有不為寒氣所襲的汽車，居家宴樂，有暖烘烘的電爐水汀，雖然外面扯絮也以的飛着雪花兒，儘可以說一句「哈哈，今年無冬」。、若是一高興，再把盞賞雪一下子，或許更將頌贊着冬，而斷章取義的說：「冬日可愛，不我欺也。」</p>
<p>瞧哪，富人們說着「今年無冬」，窮人們却儘有在西北風裏，牙齒擊着牙齒，索索地不住打着顫的呢。但是，我告訴你，在西北風裏打顫的，瞧着似乎是該對之表示同情的，可是我却以為他們也是各有應得，因為洋車夫，碼頭小工，出賣勞力的人們，是儘可在西北風裏淌汗的。不倘汗，那便是表示着懶。懶，誰還能得同情呢？</p>
<p>但是，天氣冷了，西北風動了，富人窮人的問題，倒還在其次，災區裏無衣無食，無家可歸的災民，將怎麽度過這個漫漫之冬呀？</p>
<h3 id="c211">結羢綫 <a href="#c211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>— 陳亮</p>
<p>若說中國女人善於利用光陰的話，當以結絨綫為最顯著，而為有目共賞者也。女學生在課堂裏上課，可以一邊聽老師的講解，一邊十指尖尖替什麽「表阿哥」結絨線翻領球衣。卽使到門房裏看信，也會結着走去的，伊寗可犧牲半個或一個鐘點在塗蔻丹的工作上，却不肯停止一分鐘不結絨線。</p>
<p>在電車上，常會見到戴眼睛穿平跟皮鞋，臂上繞黑紗，頭頸裏掛自來水筆的女人挨在「頭等」角落裏結着絨綫，目不旁視，全神灌注於兩支竹針上，但又不會錯過伊的目的地。伊是某督敎徒型的，精敏而又具有充份智識的女人。</p>
<p>走進公園，在舖滿暖和陽光的草坪上，或在那幾株槭樹的旁邊，會發現靜淑而溫文的姑娘正忙碌着兩隻嫩如白橡膠的手，或為伊的弟弟結絨線帽，或為伊的兄長結西裝背心，或為伊的媽結臂籠子。寂然的花香，寂然的芳心，為黃葉子嘆息再三的都市詩人，亦徘徊在伊的左右了，而他的詩題就是「結絨線的姑娘。一</p>
<p>隔壁小毛頭亦削了兩隻竹筷，又不知在那裏弄來一團骯髒得也叫不出類色的絨繩，一天到夜的結了拆，拆了結，結結拆拆，最近居然會結出花紋來了，然而伊老子是個窮漢，買不起一磅或兩磅絨線，只好專替人家結，收一點工錢，貼補油鹽之資，人家都道小毛頭的聰敏，手法好。可是，這又有什麽用呢，壓根兒還不是「為人作嫁衣」嗎？可憐的小毛頭哪。</p>
<p>西北風開始可人世壓迫，水汀皮裘階級當然免凍，有賢妻良母的，還有絨綫衫可溫暖身子。孤獨的人呵，將向誰去要求，當看見那些結絨綫的女人。唉，還是去要求小毛頭！</p>
<h3 id="c212">可憐的母子 <a href="#c212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<h3 id="c213">冬天的被窩 <a href="#c213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>— 惟經</p>
<p>詩人們，到了冬天，會得圍爐咏雪眞雅。慈善家到了冬天，會得為啼飢號寒的災民打算，一片婆心。傖夫俗子，到了冬天，會得在酒與女人之間，追尋享樂。下走一不會吟詩，二沒錢行善，三也沒興兒追求那種未入流的享樂，因此對於冬，無好感，也無惡威，我為我，冬為冬，風馬牛不相及也。</p>
<p>但是在冬天，我卻有一種特別的嗜好，那便是戀被窩。雖然我的被，不是完全國貨的絲棉被，也不是道地舶來的鴨絨被，但是在老被絮的被窩中，暖烘烘兒的，蜷縮在裏面，也是挺够味的。更其是越到了該離床的時候，更暖得可人，在那時侯，留戀一會兒，眞可說是南面王不我易也，因為我相信每天得五更上朝的天子大哥，决沒　清福可享。</p>
<p>戀被窩究竟是甜是鹹，果然是形容不出，但是那味兒可眞不惡。在將離床而未離床時，朝外翻一個身，再朝裏翻一個身，若是被角上有了窟窿，覺得有一股寒氣侵入時，說是遲，那時快，把被角隨手一拉，緊緊地一裹，哼，那時眞有從骨裏都鬆爽出來的受用。若是離離床時間，只有三五分鐘時，再把被兒裏緊着，暖烘烘的再　目養神一會兒，其味較酒徒的一盃在手，遠勝十百倍。</p>
<p>通常，每天為衣食所驅，不能不黎明卽起，對於被窩的留戀，總有些兒心餘力絀之苦，惟有挨到星期日，那才是得其所哉。在冬季裏的星期日，因心無罣碍，所以待到被小便壓迫得驚醒過來時，總上是日上三竿了。但被外的氣候，比了被內，總差着三四個月的季節，所以待到小便急得忍無可忍時，咬着牙，鑽出被窩解放了一下之後，回進被窩時，眞有災民被賑之樂。這一戀，總得戀到日色亭午，被窩中冷冰冰的戀無可戀時，才毅然起床。</p>
<p>戀被之樂樂何如—惜哉，每年的冬季，僅只短短的三個月。</p>

<h3 id="c214">皮貨雜談 <a href="#c214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>— 南丁</p>
<p>吾人每到了冬令，朔風凛冽，天寒地凍的時候，便易裘禦寒。富貴的人家，穿的是狐裘灰鼠等珍品，少康人家，也有羊皮，貧苦的人家，連棉衣也有時尙缺，更不必談到皮裘了。</p>
<p>皮貨的種類奇多，貴賤不一，同是一種皮貨，因了出　的不同，也有優劣的分別。到了冬天，穿皮裘的人，對於皮貨的來源和優劣，倒也是必須知道的常識。</p>
<p>海龍　海龍是皮貨中最貴重的一種，北方人呌做海虎，南方人却呌作海龍，所以海虎海龍，原是一種。海龍的出產地方，是在海水之內，是一個生長於海中的動物，海參崴出產很多，毛厚而黑，略帶紅黃色，其暖無比，在海內的時候，外面尙有一層薄皮，將毛保護，把皮揭去，方現出這溫厚的絨毛。因捕捉的不易，同了異常的溫暖而堅固，價格便貴到十分，而且現在的出產甚少，自然越發的貴重了。市上所售的海龍，大都是老貨，上海以大集成為最多，因在去年，曾經買到了一大批的故宮皮貨，內有很多的海龍，所以開了一個海龍大會。</p>
<p>紫貂　貂皮也是極珍貴的毛貨，可以融解冰雪，其暖便可想而知了。出產地最多的是在俄羅斯西伯利亞一帶，因貂生長在寒帶，西伯利亞很多。最好的一種呌黑金貂，是黑而有金紅色的，面上又有白毛，所謂銀槍貂就是，次一等的名紫貂，在蒙古甘木雀司等地方出產，還有一種靑根貂，根上發靑，比了紫貂，却相差得遠了。</p>
<p>狐皮　狐皮也以蒙古邊界最多，可分為白狐，火狐，玄狐，黃狐，尋常的狐皮和沙狐，玄狐最貴，色純黑，毛底帶赤，白狐純白如雪，火狐如火一般的顏色，黃狐是黃色的，白狐皮最嫩而輕，穿時如若無物，價稍低於玄狐，火狐價尤次，黃狐和奪常的狐皮，較火狐又低，沙狐却最賤了，差不多同羊皮相仿。狐裘大都是用狐嵌所製，便是狐的身體，其餘以狐腿製的便呌狐腿，狐頭狐爪，都可以另製為裘，價格以紅狐腿最貴，沙狐所製的最次。</p>
<p>灰鼠　灰鼠近年，亦成了珍品之一，以灰背為最好，便是用灰鼠的背皮所做。出產地在東北關外，吉林省所出的，毛薄而嫩，名關東貨，在灰鼠中最次，不經穿，出在齊齊哈爾等的灰鼠，毛厚皮老，色黑而帶紅，謂之蘇露鼠，是灰鼠中的首選。捕捉灰鼠，極為奇怪，大都在山谷中捕捉，在冬令天發大霧之後，即可入山捕捉，巳是遍地皆是，可以得到甚多，倘是未發大霧，要找一個灰鼠，也不可得，所以捕灰鼠的人，都以有霧為入山機會，而且必須在冬令，因冬令毛足，秋夏兩季，尙未長成，春季則正脫毛時期，都不可用的。</p>
<p>其餘尙有灘皮出自甘肅，靑棕羊出在蒙古等種種的皮貨，產地都絕不相同。上海的皮貨，是全國第一，因採取皮貨的人，先由上海客莊揀取，再發交別地，所以要購買上好的皮貨，上海是最適宜的地方。</p>

<p>第二十二回　俠語動脂唇羣姝集議虛情驚玉腕苦女逃囚</p>
<p>志前只好站了起來向他連連的搖着手。同時可就眼望了後墻窗子外，不住的努嘴。北海向那邊看時，正是月英的祖母和母親，抖抖擻擻的由這裏走向後門去。在他們後面，還跟了一個男子漢，正是那藍專員的聽差。他一面在後頭跟着，一面　咕着。北海道：程先生看這情形，又生出什麼問題來了嗎？志前，笑道：當然有點什麽關係，要不然，那聽差巳犯不上這樣跟着了。北海兩隻眼睛，釘住了窗子外看着，絲毫也不轉動。直到不看見這三個人的人影子，才向着志前道：藍專員到這裏來，就是要來找事情做的，像賈多才這樣蹂躪女權，正值得他們追究。志前笑道：就着你的立塲說話，大概是無論什麼人，你都認為是和你同情的了。這是一句淡話，倒叫北海不能有什麽話跟着向下說了。他在這話子裏強自鎭定着，坐了一會，便道，程先生有什麼事嗎？志前想着，今天是你突然來找我的，你自己又突然的要走，有事沒事，你心裏明白，問我有什麽用？便笑道：我沒有什麼事，不過我勸你遇事冷淡些，不要太熱心了。為人心越熱，釘子就碰得越大。北海道：我也不怎麽熱心，不過好說公道話罷了。這事與我有什麽相干，我倒去白操心。他說着這話，已經是拔開脚步，向外面走了去。這次不走前門了，逕直的走到後門口來。果然的，那個藍專員的　差，正靠了門框子，在那裏向對過小門洞子裏望着。那兩個婦人，還是在院子裏走着呢？北海站在門口，也向那邊門裏頭望去。那聽差看到他這種樣子，只管向他週身上下，看了一個够。北海倒有些難為情，設若自己走了開來，恐怕是更讓人家疑心。於是向那聽差笑了笑道：你先生看，這兩個女人不是很可憐嗎？那聽差從來沒有聽到人叫他作先生，見一個學生樣子的人，這樣向他稱呼着，不由得心裏大為高興。（三七五）</p>

<p>— 夢若</p>
<p>幾天前，本報登載某外人投函，謂某晚道過地豐路時，見石牆側有二男二婦，婦各抱一嬰兒，二男則大呼「賣小孩」，訽其來歷，知他們為北方農民，因水荒逃至上海，現所携薄資已盡，不得不鬻兒以延殘喘，他卽傾囊相助，並代乞鄰於巡捕，及皇家旅館，救世軍，某大敎會，華洋義振會等處，請為收容，均遭拒絕。</p>
<p>這位外人，確很仁慈。他見幾個逃荒難民要賣小孩，便大動惻隱之心，不惟助以金錢，且代為向各方呼籲。但結果使他很失望，旅館拒絕於先，卽慈善機關，也閉門於後。他於是慨歎道：「嗚呼！此輩飢鴻，其果無地可棲乎？否則何以人皆擯諸不顧乎？」</p>
<p>我看这位仁慈的外人，許是初到中國的。故他目睹這一幕人間慘劇，立刻就生不認之心。其實這類事情，在我國各地，隨時可以發現。賣孩子算什麽？吃孩子肉也不見得如何希奇。在這個年頭。人說「窮則變」，現下我國人民，已窮到再無可窮了！</p>
<p>平心而論，他們慈善機關之拒絕　幾個難民，也自有其所以拒絕的原因。近來各地逃荒難民，正一批一批的集至上海來。要是來一個，收一個，恐怕最大的收容所，再設立一千處，也有無法容納之勢。</p>
<p>然而便聽他們飢死凍斃嗎？這又是說不過去的，外國人見到我國的難民，也曾加以憐憫。難道我們對於自己的同胞，反而無動于中，不思救濟嗎？並且，上海是一個全國最繁榮的地方，只要一班有錢人肯慷慨，收容一些難民，還不至於辦不到。故我們希望上海各慈善機關，今年能多擴充幾個難民收容所，來救濟我們的災胞。這是我們的義務，也是人類應有的道義啊！</p>

<p>— 林豪</p>
<p>童年，在額上的皺紋一條條劃着的時候失踪了。</p>
<p>故鄉依然故我地存在，那屹立在小山頂上的小赤楊樹，已然長成得那麼高了，迎着風飄飄地搖着椏支。山，依然長滿了青草，在早晨，滴着昨夜的露水，翠綠得更可愛。蒼鷹不住地撲着它的翅膀，在高大的森林裏飛來飛去，時時長吟着自由的頌歌。可是，我那值得留戀的活潑潑底童年呢？</p>
<p>重又走到童年時曾留下許多故跡的神秘的小路裏來了，是泥地，一條長得無休止的路是被漫長的荒草和蘚苔掩滅着，祗露出僅有一尺來闊的中間，是光禿禿的土地。捉迷藏，這裏是一個很難招的所在。人。蒙住了布，向草動處亂撲亂抓的，但是很罕見的會被抓到。</p>
<p>路上的草，像是較童時長了，像我的人一樣的。</p>
<p>澄清而平靜的河，小魚兒搖着大尾，兀自張着嘴動，有什麽影子在河面掠過，它就會把尾巴一挺地射過去了。</p>
<p>如果現在還是童年的話，我應該怎樣地留戀着這自然的流漾哪！可惜現在的心田直像一片乏水的沙漠，榨不出一滴津津的甘露呀！</p>
<p>在童年，記得瞧見了海就會膽寒，那澎湃的浪，那湍急的漩渦，那　　的怒潮，那沒有邊緣的水天相連的宏偉，一顆孩子的心，達達地跳個不住。但實際呢？却也感到這海的偉大，感到這海會給你心身的愉快。</p>
<p>現在心腔中的海是那樣平凡的，單調的了。</p>
<p>心，像枯了的殘樹，一片沙漠，失了顫動作用似的麻木。……</p>

<p>— 孟蕭</p>
<p>，西北風帶着刺了，小三子身上只有一件破爛的夾衣，但他却眼巴巴　　　　　　　　　　了，地上積着幾寸　厚的雪。小三子一早就起來，把那個勒吐精罐子套在手腕上，緊着步子向施窮處跑去。</p>
<p>「要是咱身上有一個袁頭，咱死亦　上　　　。」小三子嘴里咕嚕着，狠狠地吐了一口口水，順嘴駡着：「媽媽的，這班小子，沒王法！」</p>
<p>破靴子踩在雪上吱吱喳喳地亂響，有些雪已給人踩實了，脚兒步踏下去，就像站在一般，滑溜溜地。小三子跑了一陣，有點累了，肚子里亦咕咕嚕嚕地響着。一天沒吃東西了，怪不得他脚下沒勁，他心里想：</p>
<p>「唉，一年不如一年了。去年在關外，就餓上三兩天全部算回事，現在，看看身體越來越糟，餓了一天，就像烟鬼沒足癮一般，什麽事都沒勁。」他搖了搖頭，破氊帽邊上的雪花亦給搖了下來，落在他的肩膀上。</p>
<p>小三子邊走着，邊想着他在關外的時候那些黃金的日子。雖不是享閒福，可是他有吃有穿，就像現在這時節，十二月了，家里亦有個小洋爐，只要有幾粒小煤球，屋里亦怪暖和。晚上的說不定還到張二子那鬍兒打它二兩白乾，緩緩兒的喝……</p>
<p>「操他媽的，××人！」小三子狠狠地駡了出來，猛然地覺得有點昏暈，他太動氣了。</p>
<p>「婊子養的，這一般王八羔子，累咱今日受粥廠里那些小子的閒氣？」這樣，小三子又想起上天粥廠里發生的那事情。「這些小子作威作福，脚踏馬屎含官氣，媽的×，有一天——嘿！」小三子心理冒火了，脚步亦加速起來，好像空空的肚子給悶氣塞飽了一樣。</p>
<p>路上的行人漸漸多了，電車亦出廠了，一個賣油條的小孩從胡同里掠出來，拉高着嗓子直喊。</p>
<p>「三哥，您早！上西門廠里去？」賣油條的小孩同他打個照面，向他請安了。</p>
<p>「是呵，你亦去？」</p>
<p>「等會兒，七點半才開廠哩！趕早了在廠門口喝西北風！」小孩子逕自走了。小三子心里想，要是俺有個把熟人，或是一點兒本錢，賣賣油條亦好，好手好脚的，跟那些老傢伙同娘兒們搶這口稀飯，眞是——不長進！</p>
<p>已走近西直門城邊了，一陣北風把他吹退了兩三步，好大的風，小三子打了一個寒噤，慌忙把領口拉緊一點，打斜着身子走。</p>
<p>路上有幾個人，手腕上亦扣着一個破洋鐵罐子，有的扶着老的有的拉着小的，他們打夥兒上粥廠去。小三子看了看，心裏更加不自在起來，他駡着自己</p>
<p>「跟這些老人家同娘兒搶這口飯，眞是，太忍心了——罪過，罪過！」小三子剛這麼想，立刻，另一個念頭就駁覆他：「有什麽：沒有本錢嗎？你有……」</p>
<p>到了粥廠了，好模好樣的警察掄着棍子叫他們排隊：「誰先來，誰先進去，別擠，別喊！要守——秩—序！」</p>
<p>「好大的架子！」小三子頂看不起這些，他嘴裏這樣咕嚕着。</p>
<p>「總爺，我走不動了，寬容我吧！」一個老婦人坐在雪地上，向那個警察懇求着。</p>
<p>「不行！要排隊。不排隊不能進去！」他用棒子指着那個老人，粗着脖子喊。</p>
<p>「哎呦——！」老婦人剛爬上來又摔下去，臥在地上，哀哀地呌。</p>
<p>「這些王八羔子，擺什麽臭架子。」小三子心想，正要走過去，有人已經把那老婦人挾上來了。</p>
<p>「我站不住呀！我腿子吃不住，你……哎—呦—！」老婦人說，手腕上掛着的那洋鐵罐子落在地上，里令里令地翻着，落在小土堆的下面。</p>
<p>粥廠的門開了，站在外邊，可以望着裏面幾個大鍋子冒着一陣陣白烟，小三子看到，彷彿就聞到一陣小米香，口水亦不受約束地滴下來。他焦急地等着，肚子亦響得分外厲害。</p>
<p>「一個人兩手半，昨天還有三手哩」。一個年青的娘兒們跑出來，不經地埋怨着說。「連黑豆亦沒了，凈是糠。」</p>
<p>排到小三子，他把勒吐精罐捧上去。用貪婪的眼睛望着那個拿着瓢子的漢子。</p>
<p>「你修好吧，再給我半手！」</p>
<p>「一個人兩手，誰亦不能多！」</p>
<p>「他們都兩手半，幹什麽我兩手，咱作事要講理，不瞎吵！」</p>
<p>「滾你媽的×！又誰拿你的錢，欠你，賣你的嗎？」</p>
<p>小三子翻過身來，嘴裏唸着：「聽啊，娘兒們一人兩手半，咱們皮不嫩，就差伴手哩！又不是他腰包掏出來的錢，還對老子討功德來！」</p>
<p>「你吵什麽！把他送到局裏去，沒王法的混蛋！」</p>
<p>一隻黑手提着小三子的後頭，另一隻手掙着小三子的臂膀，他的勒吐精罐子倒在地上，一些黃色的米漿濺在雪上騰着熱氣。</p>

<p>— 曼因</p>
<p>我是夙來安於貧困的，對於人家的奢豪富貴，我從來沒有一秒鐘的幻想在我腦神經中盤旋過。做人，祗要什麽都對得過自家的良心，帝力無有於吾哉？我就這樣做人到現在。今年夏天，為了想帮一個朋友的忙，却反而兩個人都丟了飯碗。朋友對我屢次表示抱歉，我又以對得住良心，並不怨恨任何人。但是每天悶居在狹小的亭子間裏，我開始不能安於貧困了，我的性情突然地暴厲起來，學會了駡人，駡了一個和我一點都不發生關係的人；有時摔東西，是用我勞力的代價所買來的東西。我受不住一百零度以上的煎逼，那母寗說我受不住飢餓的威脅，要安於貧苦至少也得具備了填飽肚子的條件。我開始懂得獎券，賭博，及一切法律所不允許的罪惡都是這樣發生的。那時候我雖然已不能安於貧困，但我還沒有超出軌外行動，在我另外找到一份職業的時候，我又安於貧困如常了，我滿足了。</p>
<p>現在的這份職業，工作比從前繁重，而待遇却相反地不及二之一，我安於這職業將近三個月，我對得住良心地做事，我一點不妬忌那些「臥薪嘗胆」的人們。最近北風怒吼，草木凋零，每夜工作歸家，我身上薄薄的衣衫已抵不住寒風的侵襲，往往在路旁慢步當車的時候，我會莫名其妙地向那些衣重裘的人們瞥這末一眼，心中也默唸着他們或許沒有感得冬天的可怕吧。這種念頭侵襲着我的時候，我知道自家又有一些兒不滿意自家的生活了。要對得住良心做事，要安於貧困，在填飽肚子之外還有個保護體溫的條件。</p>
<p>這幾天做事就不免疏懶下來，想看看那些吃得飽穿得暖的人們是否會賜佈一份意外的同情。但是什麽都沒有，他們馬上覺得他們所付的代價不能收得相當的成績而憤怒，我被那些人像猪狗一樣申斥一頓。回家時候，我想做一做超乎軌外行動的罪惡了；在計劃着怎樣向那些人們報復，或是我獲得一筆意外的錢財，我也擠上那些人們之羣中向他們示威。一路想着走，在一家百貨商店的橫路上，被一羣大家的癟三阻隔了我的前進，想倒身更換一條馬路走時，一個巡捕突如其來拉着那些癟三走了。由於路人的議論，我知道那些癟三在這裏搶奪那家百貨商店的人行道上的地盤。因為那家百貨商店的地下室裏有一架發電機，沿人行道一帶由電力的傳佈，卽是水門汀也溫暖異常，那些癟三就想搶來做一夜的避寒所。我被這幅情狀感動了，我應該安心做事，我還不是世界上最貧困的人，或許有成千成萬的手想抓取我這份職業，成千成萬的眼睛羡慕着我這變薄質的棉衣。（冬夜隨筆之一）</p>

<p>黛玉悲秋</p>
<p>愁花愁草潦愁天。淒風淒雨打窗簾。千個琅玕風颼颼。一園芳草雨綿綿。瀟湘館裏聲寂寂。葬花妃子病懨懨。想他是，多愁多病更多恨。可泣可歌復可憐。花容更比梅花瘦。嬌喘細如一縷烟。善病西子風不禁。多愁息媯默無言。終日裏，紛漬脂痕和淚洗。藥爐茶灶帶愁煎。只見那，案頭藥方盈尺厚。妝台菱花光無豔。你看他，坐廢梳妝倦廢睡。愁裏心事夢裏簽。雪　半偏怕整理。珠淚雙拗湧如泉。敲殘紅豆朗慵起。挑盡青燈夜懶眠。梅花紙帳難成夢。藕絲繍被半撇邊。秋深尙裏蟬衣衫。新淚猶掛碧紗帘。紫鵑拭淚侍茶匣。雪雁心傷侍藥烟。但聽他，聲聲嗽。歎連連。撫腸一哭淚潛潛。說道紫鵑呀，人說秋天風光存。爲什麽，</p>
<h2>Page 19</h2>
<p>奴見秋最愁更添。你看那，秋月濛濛寒似水。秋風颯颯冷如剪。秋光條條遊子流，秋雨瀝瀝動秋念。秋蟲唧唧魂欲斷。秋雖呱呱夢亂顛。秋山寂寂路人醉。秋濤滾滾催客旋。幾許秋景多是惱。故而奴，提起秋字不忍言。可憐奴，遠離家鄉千里外。飄零蹤跡在此間。翹首故土望不到。零丁孤苦像孤雁。策反家國成畫餅。恐怕是，再硯舊地變虛言。諒想是，一塊黃土在戌地。殘枝枯骨要葬客邊。況且奴，椿萱既已經秋萎。海棠何必映日鮮。到召集，愁到五更夜似歲。病至九秋月如年。一日三秋思宛轉。五風十浪路幾千。迴腸九曲心悄然。陽關三疊恨未宣。只怕那，藥石飛籠難療疾。也不過，白駒空駛度殘年。故而奴，將死何必開鏡匣。蓬飛誓不上金鈿。奴，常把韶光愁裏過。每將心緒付閔弧。奴是，薄倖郎當作了多情子，誰知道，兜率宮即是那離恨天。至今日，好事依稀成幻夢。人情冷暖盡桑田。軟語溫言都隨假。天長地久復何言。這都是，孽堅甘是甘煩惱。僵蠶自縛自用藺。豈不是，據衷悲哀追何極。整志悔悟巳重泉。可憐奴，病入膏盲無人問。臥倒床衾有那個憐。可憐奴，雨霖荷蓋偷彈淚。露滴蓮房苦心田。可憐奴，不見人影臨床慰。只有病魔到枕邊。可憐奴，毫無興趣吟詩句。有伺心緒去弄琴弦。可憐奴，硯池久涸生　魚。葬花詩不忍續完簡。最怕聽。枝上杜字驚好夢。窗前鸚鵡學奴言。最怕聽。風禁鐵馬清如語。雨灑寒窗薄似煙。那林姑娘不勝悲秋歡。可憐他，一滴血淚一聲言。想那，聽　何故多薄命。文章爲甚忌紅顔，好呌我，當空咄咄要問蒼天。</p>

<p>— 虞</p>
<p>製造商實行新合作計劃　汽車年展期提早之原因</p>
<p>美國的汽車事業。經過了這幾年的努力奮　。現在已經一步步地走向好轉之路。眞像美兩汽車製造商會主席阿爾文，麥考萊氏所譬喻。他大意說。目下的汽車製造業好似玩足球一般。經過了大家的聯絡工作之後。球已經重復被我們獲得。續用着聯絡的方法。將那獲到的球踢向敵人的陣地中去。這樣的化險爲夷之後。球員們的精神一振。大家格外興奮。向外更抱着决勝的勇氣。</p>
<p>上面所說的抱着必勝的决心。現在已埋藏在汽車製造業的各領袖胸中。自從他們在一九三二年將球奪回來之後。他們便用着不斷的努力。做着很好的聯絡工作。把那球常放在他們的管轄之下。並且過了中界綫。直向繁榮恢復之途射去。汽車製造家現在用一種上好的戰略。就是在出品方面。不斷地精益求精。使那車子的價値。較顧主所出的抬價超過。這是一個最有效。而常立於不敗地方的好方策。</p>
<p>拿事實來講。今年的產車數額。眞和前面所引的一段喻言吻合。據預估的結果。本年美國的汽車產量。把汽車和商用運貨車併合起來。約共三，六七五，〇〇〇輛。這個數目不僅超過去年的出品百分之二十八。且也較了一九三二年的產量。大約要增上兩倍半的樣子。又據可得的數字來觀察。一九三五年本國市塲的零售額。較了去年已高出百分之三十八。在客車方面多得百分之四十。運貨車方多上百分之三十。在勞工節那一天計算。今年零售汽車數已超過一九三二年十二個月的總售數。</p>
<p>講到國外銷售。因爲世界各地的需要增進。預料一九三五年整個的出口汽車數將達五三五，〇〇〇輛。比起去年要增加百分之二十七。國外貿易的所以能如此起色。他的原因也不止一端。最明顯的像外匯的穩定。對於各國間互惠關稅的成立。和各主要國逐漸恢複繁榮。及美製汽車價彼的增進等等。咸有連帶的關係。</p>
<p>秋季新模型車的登塲。對於國外鉗售更有良好的帮助。美製汽車於今年首次的行銷到南半球去。在他們重要的銷售季開始時候。新車便能應時售出。又在歐洲車展舉行的時候。美製的歐式車亦將同時貢獻。美國運售到南半球去的。在近兩年來已有顯著的進步。到明年春季新車更將陸續輸往。預測當有全出口數中的百分之六十出售到那里。</p>
<p>一九三六年新車之可銷售外國者。其數當在六五〇·〇〇〇輛左右。這樣一來。在工人獲得工作方面。無論直接的或間接的將大有裨益。預計造車。零件。輪胎。及其他有關係的谷業。將有一二五，〇〇〇人獲得工作。不得不說是一個很大的帮助哩。還有一個比較嚴正的估計。一九三六年式新車之行銷外國的。其數目大槪六三五，〇〇〇輛。</p>
<p>最近美國的汽車製造商中。實行一種極好的合作精神。來把汽車生產格外的　它穩定。這個計劃已在今年開始。這個計劃中的一端。就是把常年的汽車展覽。提早兩個月舉行。在今年的十一月裏。便在紐約揭幕了。合作計劃的全體主要目的。是在把製造汽車業。和其相連帶的各業工作。使他們的工作。得以支配勻均。並在淸檔的各季得以不致减少工作。</p>
<p>這個合作計劃的主要意義。能從各項事實上來觀察。通常汽車銷售的數量。因爲節季關係。漲落靡定。使生產額有時多。有時少。而工人們的工作。亦因之大受影響。有時候淸淡的月份。其產額較之旺月要低跌百分之三十。因爲冬季中不能保持正常的生產量。以備春季銷售。以致往年工人們在這個時候所獲得的工作。是比較的很有限的。</p>
<p>來解决這個問題。和改善工人們的工作狀况。各廠家便在今年開始一種遠大的計劃。其中一個特色就是將往年在正月中舉行的汽車年展。提早到十一月中就舉行了。在已往的三十年問。汽車展覽是照例在正月中開幕的。此外。各製造廠又同意在訂購原料方面。另行一種新的計劃。使得與汽車有連帶關係的各業工人。獲得最大的工作利益。一方面使各汽車廠自己的工人。在一月和二月之中獲得充份的工作。製造各種春季上塲的新車配件。</p>
<p>最近兩個月來。美國的其他重要實業。也採行一種急劇的更改。在從前一到秋季要實行緊縮的。現在已改變方針了。因爲從九月以來。已覺到需要上增進的緣故。像鋼鐵業比了從前同時要增加兩倍有奇。其他鐵路。礦產等也有同樣的現象。至於租汽車製造有關係的各大小工業。那更不用多說了。</p>
<p>如果要使上面的計劃獲得成功。那末有兩大點不容忽視的。一，冬季的零售數量一定要上增。二，目下勞資雙方的合作精神必須很好的保持着。目下轎車在汽車市塲上的銷路一年好似一年。因爲製造廠的出品。轎式車要佔全數百分之九十九。而近代的各處公路又能使車輛在各季駛行。有這兩種緣故。今冬的汽車銷數預料必甚可觀的。</p>

<p>凡曾參觀道奇檢騐塲者。一經見及道奇汽車所受之種種嚴格測騐。殆莫不搖頭嘆息。以爲檢騐機器所施於道奇者。何竟慘酷乃爾。惟自另一方面言之。此種嚴格測騐。實爲人逍主義之表現。絕不能謂爲慘酷。　以檢騐之惟一目的。原欲以實騐方法。確切證明駕駛之安全與可靠耳。</p>
<p>按此種檢騐機器。道奇工程師名之曰“BelgianRoll　”道奇汽車。經此機之一日試騐。則其所受磨折，直與歷經理想中所能想像之艱苦服務若干年者相等。故苟有若何微疵。勢必立卽發現。萬、難隱飾。若係日常駕用。則此種微細缺點。雖經年累月。亦必無從覺察也。道奇汽車。於此絕對嚴格毫無假借之各種測騐之下。獨能愉快勝任。於以知其底盤，車身，引擎，車輪，以及全車其餘任何部份。無不盡美盡善。而其駕駛之安全可靠。亦因而獲得又一鐵證焉。</p>

<p>當此綫圈發火。應用最爲普徧。與汽車上之各項電氣零件。種類日益增多之時。其最需用而不可或缺之件。其惟蓄　池乎。蓄電池果能盡量發揮其效用。而無絲毫缺點。則雖極艱難困苦之際。亦殊得心應手。易於　過。凡此情形。蓋有經騐之汽車界人士所習知者。夫蓄電池之功用。旣若斯之廣泛而重要。則花旗博施牌新式。過電器之發明。其具有偉大價値。與重要貢獻。蓋可不言而喻矣。</p>
<p>花旗博施牌過電器。　眞正經濟合算之一種新發明。利用此器以過電。則一夜之間。電池所容電量。自然綽乎有餘。於是翌晨駕車。無不立卽發動。如響斯應。而蓄電池本身之壽命，亦旦因此而延長。此外尤足稱者。此器於兩夜之問。能使電池十足充電。而斷無過量之虞？蓋當電池到達最大容量時。充電率卽自動减為滴流。對於電池。毫無所損也。</p>
<p>按此項過電器對於一般車主之置有車上收音機者。裨益有非淺鮮。蓋可利用之。以使收音機之音調。彌極淸晰悅耳也。至僅於週末應用所備車輛之家庭。祗須置辦此種過電器一具。則蓄電池每週充電之問題。遂可澈底解决。而省卻不少　煩。再此過電器。不僅爲車主所宜備。卽醫師離貨商洗衣作焙製師收欵員百貨肆等。亦莫不需用之　。此器有應用於大小電池之兩種式樣。其所用之電。與中等大小之燈泡略同。殊爲經濟云。</p>

<p>（一）完成荔濛路。此路由荔浦城東之張村起至蒙山之杜英二十五里路基。早經完成。由杜英至貓兒塘二十七里路基。橋涵工程均不甚大。惟由蒙山城經水竇過新開大塘。繞白竹隴經小水埇而至陳村。更由陳村經均常繞商田崗過平洞埇。而達太平。此段計長一百四十里。路工較大。橋涵度數亦多。至由太平至濛江一段。通車已久。無須再行施工。由荔浦至柳桂賀等地程途不相上下。如荔濛全綫通車以後。桂區與梧州大河交通固甚便利。卽柳河水綫之際柳區方面。客貨亦可繞經荔浦以出濛江而達梧州大河。不惟桂梧柳梧之交通。均可一日而達。且桂柳賀之客。旣抵濛江而後。並可乘輸上駛。由武林沿容武路入容縣。而至玉林。路旣循環暢通。則荔濛一綫。不惟可使柳桂兩區公路直通大河。而柳桂梧三區路綫。更可互相聯絡。關係省內交通至爲重要。原擬與第一年度各綫同時興築。但以第一年度需費已逾兩百萬元以上。如再加築此綫。庫欵負擔。未免過重。故决於第一度各綫完成之後。卽於第二年度完成此綫。</p>
<p>第三年度興築路綫</p>
<p>（一）興築九大路此路自都安之九頓墟起。經天塔村欄塘·翁峒·猺南·里子·下坳·光坰·以達那嶺一段。多崎嶇曲折。起仗橫斷。怪石硝壁。綿亘重疊。間工程甚大。由那嶺經保平以至九墟一段。尙屬平直。由九墟經長志而至大廠一段。則難易相問。全綫長二百餘里。此路完成之後。由欽州海口經南寗·武嗚·都安·車河·而至六寨入黔。比較經賽遷·大慶　河池而至六寨入黔之綫。可以减短行程三百里。對於黔省與海口兩方之出入客貨關係至鉅。就　桂粵三省利害言之，其重要非丹池路可當以比擬。故擬於第二年度築成荔濛路。以後卽於第三年度興築此綫。</p>
<p>第四年度興築路綫</p>
<p>（一）完成賀梧路。此路由賀縣城經水竹塘梅花馬練界信都城而達沙頭。再由沙頭經石橋風門峽至山心。而達蒼梧之大灕口。全長三百六十里。除山心至大灕口一段業經完成外。其餘由駕縣城至信都城一百二十里路基亦經築成。惟由信都之黃花至蒼梧之山心一段。長一百五十里。路基橘涵。均未施工。此路與桂梧兩區之文化經濟政治軍事之關係。與荔濛路同一重要。而於富賀鍾鑛區之開發。更有相當助益。故於第三年度築成九大路之後。卽繼續完成此綫。</p>
<p>（二）興築武湟路。此路係由武宣城起至桂平縣屬大湟江止。其由武宣至新路橘一段二尙屬平坦。由新路橋至三里圩則多係山坡。由三里圩經三江霸而達東鄉之大黃冲口。中越兩均亦多沿山破而行。　大黃冲口以達花當村　　則頗爲崎嶇。由花雷村至三江圩均係砂石。三江圩至新圩中有石壁山峽僅容單人行走。頗有險要。自此前行。卽達大湟江口。全路長二百里。此路完成之後。柳區公路卽可通出大河。由大湟江渡河而南。並可以與梧區公路幹綫互相銜接。</p>

<h3 id="e20">The Revival of the Student Movement <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>— Bing</p>
<p>On the morning of the 9th, thousands of students from various universities in Beiping petitioned He Yingqin, raising slogans such as safeguarding the security of North China and upholding national rights. Many citizens also participated, and the public sentiment was extremely激昂 (jī áng - aroused, vigorous). Today, as anger and loyalty fill our hearts, when we read this news, all Chinese people should feel a sense of release from their repressed feelings. Although the police and military police tried to dissuade them, it inevitably made the participants feel somewhat unhappy. However, this is not a concern. The police and military police only know to maintain order, which is their duty. Persuading is also their job. Students, citizens, and the national public should understand this.</p>
<p>The primary duty of students is to focus on their studies. This is a self-evident principle, and there is no room for argument. Similarly, the primary duty of workers is to engage in physical labor and production, and the primary duty of merchants is to trade in goods. If one does not focus on this, it is abandoning one's duty. However, apart from one's primary duty, are we not allowed to consider matters related to our lives? The nation is what the people entrust their lives to. In this modern era where the distinction between territories is strictly defined, the concept of the nation is deeply connected to life. When a nation is invaded by a strong force and is on the verge of danger, all people with blood and breath know that their own fate is approaching a dangerous situation. Therefore, they worry and work hard, seeking to find a way to survive from a situation of near-death. Is this going beyond one's role or meddling in others' affairs? It is merely seeking to fight for one's own survival. If one is blamed for abandoning one's primary duty, one would reply, "The situation is urgent, and one cannot afford to focus solely on one's primary duty." These words are uttered with the utmost grief and the deepest pain. If one has a heart, one should not regard them as sophistry. Today, students in Beiping, being in a position to hear and see more acutely, feel the deep pain in their bones. It is no longer possible to calmly focus on their studies, so they rise up to petition and express their heartfelt voices, alerting their compatriots. Their actions deserve deep understanding. It is not only the students in Beiping who harbor such thoughts and urgently want to express them. When one patrols the market and visits the neighborhoods, one hears these urgent voices everywhere. It is just that there have not been large-scale processions. Therefore, it can be said that the students in Beiping represent the national public in making a declaration.</p>
<p>Let's look at the slogans raised by the students in Beiping: "Safeguarding the security of North China" and "Upholding national rights." These are the minimum demands of the Chinese public. North China belongs to the Chinese people, and the nation belongs to the Chinese people. Safeguarding it and upholding it are like a private household protecting its property. There is absolutely no violation of the universal principle of ownership, nor does it violate the essence of the principles of harmonious relations between nations. If even these minimum demands are not allowed to be harbored in one's heart, expressed from one's mouth, or manifested in reality, then the Chinese public will have no choice but to make a final struggle, not hesitating to make sacrifices. Moreover, what the Chinese public demands is practical and not a mere title. "Safeguarding" must truly achieve safeguarding, and "upholding" must truly achieve upholding. If it is like a writer writing an article, merely using "safeguarding" and "upholding" as the title and elaborating on it, but the reality is far removed, then it is still not enough to satisfy the wishes of the Chinese public. This is the implicit meaning that should be contained within the slogans, and it is specially emphasized so that everyone can understand it.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the student movement has been silent for several years. We will not delve into the reasons for its silence. In general, the student movement can unblock repressed feelings and ignite public sentiment. It is by no means a pointless or disgusting act. As with this current movement, it originates in Beiping, where the student movement has the most historical ties. It declares public opinion and presents concise points, making the powerful aware that the Chinese public cannot be easily insulted, and diplomats can also rely on it as a backing for maneuvering and negotiating. Recently, the government and the public have been advocating for respecting freedom of speech. We believe that this freedom should be given due respect within the bounds of not going astray.</p>

The Ministry of Finance has now instructed that the limit production measures should follow the precedents of the Changlu, Lu, and Huai salt regions. Before salt production begins next spring, a preliminary limit on production volume should be proposed for approval and implementation. The five prefectures of eastern Zhejiang should be strictly supervised to ensure that they collect salt at 60% of the original quota, without further delay. As for intensifying anti-smuggling efforts in border areas and increasing tax rates, instructions will be issued to the Zhejiang salt transport envoy for verification and response.

<h3 id="e41">Italian Forces in East Africa Continue Aerial Bombardment; Abyssinian Army's Southern Defenses Solidified; Frontline Supplies Become a Problem <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>Addis Ababa: Rumors indicate that Italian aircraft continue to bombard central cities in the Ogaden region. Details are unknown. According to unconfirmed reports, Italian aircraft bombed Angober, a city 150 kilometers northeast of the capital. Also, Italian aircraft flew over Taichau this morning, but did not drop bombs. (Havas, 9th)</p>
<p>Tigre Province Frontline: According to our correspondent Barr, Abyssinian troops on the southern front previously attempted to recapture the town of Gorahai, but were unsuccessful. Since then, they have concentrated large forces to defend the Dagapoh area. This location, like Harar, is a strategically important place with very complete defensive fortifications, indicating the involvement of European officers. (Havas, 10th)</p>
<p>Addis Ababa: According to our special correspondent Ochaina, information from the Tigre Province frontline has been received. General Seyssion's troops attacked an Italian detachment on the 2nd of this month, defeating them and killing four enemies. Abyssinian troops also attacked Italian positions in the Menage area, driving out the stationed Italian troops and killing five enemies. The Abyssinian army suffered only one death and two injuries. Also, on the 8th of this month, 50 soldiers under the command of the traitor General Gugsa defected from the Italian army and rejoined the Abyssinian army. (Havas, 10th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Italian government has notified League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol that Italy will issue a note regarding the aerial bombing of Taichau, Abyssinia. It is generally believed that this note will state: (1) that the establishment of a hospital in Taichau by the United States was not formally announced beforehand; (2) that there were a large number of Abyssinian troops stationed in Taichau and its vicinity, so it was legitimate for Italian aircraft to bomb them. (Havas, 9th)</p>
<p>Addis Ababa: According to our special correspondent Beaulchina, since the start of the war, frequent troop movements have made military supplies a problem. The Abyssinian army takes food from the local area. There are many people eating in the areas where troops are stationed, so resources are quickly depleted. In areas where troops are not stationed, the population has sharply decreased due to the drafting of young men to the front lines, leading to a surplus of food and oversupply. To remedy this uneven distribution, the Abyssinian government has appointed Walde Manuel, the former governor of Qima province, as the Minister of Supplies, ordering him to properly distribute food throughout the country. After receiving the order, Walde has prepared to take office immediately. His first step is to focus on supplies to the Tigre Province front in the north, roughly planning to extend the road from Addis Ababa to Taichau northward to Yedu, so that the grain currently stored in Taichau can be transported to the northern front. Then, grain stored in the capital or central provinces will be transported to Taichau for relief. As for the Ogaden area in the south, the fertile areas of the Qirqir and Arusi regions and convenient transportation make it easier to solve the frontline supply problem. (Havas, 10th)</p>
<h3 id="e42">Naval Conference Opens; Atmosphere of Breakdown Already Deep; Britain and America Exert Themselves to Oppose Japanese Demands; Plenary Session Yesterday Discussed Quantitative Limits <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>(London) The general discussion at the plenary session of the Naval Conference began yesterday. According to the first communiqué issued by Clarence House, the location of the conference, this discussion continued this morning. Today, the British representative stated his views on quantitative and qualitative limits and explained Paragraph 4 of the 1930 London Naval Treaty (regarding the treatment of merchant ships by submarines in wartime). The chief representatives of the United States, France, Italy, and Japan also expressed their opinions on this matter. Then, the conference proceeded to discuss quantitative limits. Japan is now demanding so-called common high limits, in other words, equality. Britain and the United States are still exerting themselves to oppose this, so the atmosphere of the conference soon breaking down is even stronger. Japan will strive for satisfaction on this issue in the initial stages of the discussion. US Chief Representative Davis stated today that he advocates maintaining the system established in the Washington and London Treaties, namely the 5:5:3 ratio. France suggested a limit on total tonnage, which Japan supports. Britain and the United States oppose this. (Reuters, 10th)</p>
<p>(London) Although the Naval Conference has just opened, its future already appears bleak. Although the speeches made by the representatives of various countries at the first meeting today only touched on the surface, according to inquiries by the Havas correspondent, the US delegation has consistently taken an uncompromising attitude on the issue of battleship tonnage. On the contrary, the arguments put forward by the representatives of France and Italy at today's meeting were identical, especially in opposing long-term strict restrictions. The wording of the French representative Corbin and the Italian representative Grandi coincided as if they had planned it. In the current situation, the delegations have no idea how the work will proceed when the Naval Conference Committee meets tomorrow. No country is willing to take the lead in raising any issues, and it is likely that the committee will first discuss the working procedures of various subcommittees. The speeches made by the representatives of various countries at this morning's plenary session will likely be technically supplemented tomorrow. If the delegations are unwilling to take the lead in speaking, the British Chief Representative, Naval Minister Monsell, will likely speak first in his capacity as chairman and ask the foreign representatives to explain their intentions. It is likely that Britain will no longer delay and will immediately raise the most thorny issue of quantitative limits, and will put forward some suggestions on this issue. Then, it will soon become clear how irreconcilable the claims of the United States and Japan are. In short, Britain is unwilling to deliberately conceal the main points of contention in the conference, because if the main points of contention are deliberately concealed for the time being, and the technical and trivial issues are first discussed by the committee and various subcommittees, then even if there is some achievement, it will inevitably be abandoned in the end due to the occurrence of major disputes.

<h3 id="e43">Japan Insists That Quality and Quantity Cannot Be Separated; US Action Depends on the Attitude of Various Countries <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>(London) The Japanese delegation plans to gather on the night of the 9th, with Plenipotentiary Nagano at the center, to discuss strategy with Iwashita, Inagaki, Abe, and others. They will thoroughly insist on the Japanese government's military reduction principle based on the common maximum limit and decide to implement the above policy to achieve their claims. The content is roughly as follows:</p>
<p>(1) If a quantitative limit cannot be established, at least a qualitative limit must be achieved. Those in charge of national defense responsibilities cannot absolutely agree with this view.</p>
<p>(2) Qualitative limits and quantitative limits are inextricably linked. Qualitative limits cannot achieve the purpose of military reduction. Needless to say, the Japanese government wants to implement thorough military reduction in order to establish a principle of non-threat and non-aggression. No matter what, it must advocate the greatest reduction in naval power.</p>
<p>(3) Plenipotentiary Nagano explained the above-mentioned determination of the Japanese government and plans to clarify the Japanese government's policy and strongly oppose it at the first committee if a qualitative limit proposal is submitted. (Domei News Agency, 9th)</p>
<p>(London) The Naval Conference, which opened yesterday, will soon deal with important events. The first event to be handled today is the British proposal for quantitative limits on various types of warships in the world. It is likely that this proposal will be supported by the United States and will be opposed by Japan. Japan's insistence on equality with the United States has already overturned the same proposal at last year's preliminary meeting. Commentators are now busy discussing the proposal in President Roosevelt's letter to US Chief Representative Davis at the time of the ten-year preliminary meeting, which called for a 20% reduction in the navy. It is said that although the United States would like to see this proposal become a reality, the US representative does not want to insist on this proposal at this conference. The direction of US action will depend on the attitude of the representatives of various countries towards the British proposal for quantitative limits. (Reuters, 10th)</p>

<p>(New York) Famous American aviator Pemberton testified under oath to the House Patents Committee today that Japan plans to seize the United States. Pemberton said that the Japanese have prepared to form a kamikaze bomber squadron to destroy American cities. "The only threat to the United States is Japan. Japan has only one goal, namely to seize the United States, seize Soviet Russia, and seize other parts of the world." Pemberton continued, saying that the Japanese have now created an aircraft capable of carrying huge bombs, whose destructive power is unmatched by any weapon. This aircraft can fly 6,000 kilometers, and its pilots do not expect to return alive. Thousands of Japanese have already volunteered to be kamikaze pilots. He learned of this matter when he and Mr. Haden were circumnavigating the globe and were arrested in Japan and accused of espionage.</p>
<p>Former Commander of the US Army Air Corps, Major General Mitchell, also testified to the committee today, saying that Japanese aircraft can fly from Alaska to New York at a height that American aircraft cannot reach. They can fly back to their base after bombing cities. Pemberton also said that the Japanese Navy could easily occupy Alaska and open up an air base there, from which they could fly to Seattle and back. Pemberton advocated opening an air base in Alaska to facilitate long-distance flight and gain the advantage of preemptive strike. Pemberton and Haden took off from here on July 28, 1921, via Europe and Siberia, and reached Japan. They were eventually detained by the Japanese authorities on suspicion of espionage and violation of Japanese military law, and were tried by the court, sentenced to 210 days in prison, fined 1,025 yuan each, and expelled from Japan. After Washington's negotiations changed the sentence, the imprisonment was revoked, the fine was paid as usual, and the two were allowed by the Japanese government to take off on October 3 of that year.

<p>(Rena, US) Senator Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Pittman gave a speech to the Rena Club today, indirectly denouncing Japan as "international bandits." Pittman said that an American-Japanese crisis will eventually come. We will one day be greatly surprised by our interests in the Pacific. Japan's occupation of Chinese territory is increasing, and our markets are decreasing. Once all of China is ruled by Japan, China will no longer be a market for American goods. Regarding Japan's military strength, Pittman said that no country in the world now has the power to stop Japan. Even if Britain blocked Japan with its entire fleet, it would be futile. Only a combined fleet of Britain and America has the authority to speak to Japan. The conflict between Italy and Abyssinia will be the final test of the League of Nations' power. If international bandits control the governments of certain countries and the police are unable to stop the bandits from attacking your cities, then the civilized forces of law and order will inevitably join forces to crack down on them. Regarding the consequences that can arise from conflicts of world interests, Pittman said that there is only one way to save the situation, and that is that we may have to take action to protect the government and the people, but the United States will not be drawn into the whirlpool of the Italian-Abyssinian war, because the United States prohibits major products and does not take sides.

<h3 id="e49">British Policy Towards China; Hong Kong Should Be the Basis; Speech by Former Governor of Hong Kong, Clementi <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>(London) Former Governor of Hong Kong, Clementi, said at a banquet of the Royal Empire Association today that Hong Kong is Britain's most valuable asset in China, so British policy towards China should be based on the needs of Hong Kong. In 1925, the British Foreign Office cherished the illusion that the people of Beijing would rule all the Chinese people, and forced Sun Yat-sen, who was willing to be friends with Hong Kong, to approach Russia, and Guangzhou and Hong Kong were disrupted by Soviet Russia, eventually resulting in Hong Kong suffering resistance and losing millions of dollars. He hoped that Britain would learn from the past and no longer sacrifice Hong Kong for its illusions. There is a natural situation of close and friendly cooperation between Hong Kong and Guangzhou. The people of Guangdong Province are diligent, capable, and peace-loving. There are now three difficulties that need to be resolved urgently: (1) The Kowloon and Yuehan roads must be connected. Guangzhou cannot be a deep-sea port. Without a direct outlet to Hong Kong, its railway commerce will be obstructed. At the same time, aircraft from mainland China must be able to make full use of the Kowloon airfield. (2) A customs agreement is essential. With this agreement, Hong Kong can levy taxes on goods transported to China. (3) The future of the Kowloon leased territory must be decided. The failure to solve this problem is now an obstacle to development. The Kowloon leased territory should either permanently belong to Britain or be returned to China. There is no other way. Clementi asked the audience to help the University of Hong Kong, because the university's funds are insufficient and it cannot develop on a large scale. If Hong Kong becomes a famous place of study, so that the Chinese view Hong Kong as the British view Oxford and Cambridge, then the most effective way to consolidate Britain's prestige in China is to do so.

<h3 id="e50">Russian Pravda Reveals Japan's Ambition Towards Mongolia; Japanese Continental Policy Aims to Invade Mongolia; Breakdown of Manzhouli Conference Not Accidental <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>(Moscow) Negotiations between Manchuria and Mongolia have broken down. Pravda commented in an article that this ending was not accidental. "The Japanese masters of Manchuria, especially the Kwantung Army authorities, had no intention of smoothly resolving the border disputes they created. Since the negotiations began in June, the Japanese warlords have repeatedly used their usual tactics of provocation and trickery to stop them halfway, so we cannot hope for any other outcome. Representatives of the Mongolian People's Republic expressed their willingness to resolve the dispute in a regular manner, considering the organization of a mixed border committee and the meeting itself (which was convened on the Mongolian side's proposal). The Manchurian representatives did the opposite. From the beginning, they were interested in the Burnol affair, using it to make greater demands on the Mongolian side. The breakdown of the negotiations coincided with Japan's pressure on northern China, so some people thought that the Japanese warlords were busy with China and that Mongolia would have long-term peace. This is a big mistake. The Mongol Empire has been coveted by Japanese imperialism for more than just yesterday." Pravda reminded readers that Japanese imperialism had already used Semyonov, Baron Ungern, and General Xu to dabble in the Mongolian People's Republic three times. Since the establishment of "Manchukuo," Japan has paid more attention to the Mongolian issue. The newspaper also stated, "One of the goals of the Japanese warlords' continental policy is to invade the Mongolian Republic and Inner Mongolia, which has not yet been incorporated into 'Manchukuo.' This task is no longer a question for Japan, but a practical task for the present (not later). If this problem can be solved appropriately, Japanese imperialism will be able to use the territory and resources of the Mongolian People's Republic to open up on both sides and attack China and the Soviet Union. The 'Manchukuo' Foreign Ministry also issued a memorandum regarding the breakdown of the negotiations, in which the threats were written all over it. Pravda concluded, "The People's Revolutionary Party and the working masses of the Mongolian Republic must prepare to repel the Japanese warlords' fourth invasion. However, the Japanese government knows very well that if this threat is realized, Japan itself will be in great danger, so it is hoped that Japan can stop the Kwantung Army in time, because they have gone too far."

<p>Port Said: According to news from Cairo, the capital of Egypt, the unrest across the country is intensifying. Leaders of various parties have agreed to jointly petition the King to restore the 1923 Constitution. This petition specifically bypasses the British government and is directed solely to the King of Egypt, demonstrating that the British government has no authority to interfere in purely Egyptian internal affairs, the intention of which is noteworthy. The leaders of the various parties also intend to send representatives to meet with Sir Miles Lampson, the British High Commissioner in Egypt, to express the Egyptian people's united hope that the British government will accept the Anglo-Egyptian Agreement proposed in 1930 and recognize Egypt's independent status, so that the relationship between the two countries can be definitively resolved.

<p>Port Said: According to news from Cairo, the capital of Egypt, the situation yesterday morning was very serious. Demonstrations occurred in various parts of the city, and the police made every effort to suppress them. Those leading the riots were students, including many female students, who clashed with the police. The police even loaded buckshot into their guns and opened fire, injuring several female students. In most areas, the police fired live ammunition at the rioters, injuring many people, but the exact number is unknown. The disturbances spread to other areas, and it is reported that the property damage was extensive. Streetlights were smashed, and many buses and streetcars were destroyed. At night, most of the city was plunged into darkness. The authorities have warned residents not to engage in further violence, and violators will be arrested and severely punished by the authorities.

<p>Madrid: The Chapaprieta cabinet resigned today. The reason for this cabinet crisis is due to internal disagreements within the cabinet regarding the financial bill. The cabinet recently submitted a bill to the Congress to increase income tax and levy inheritance tax, which was opposed by the majority of right-wing members of parliament. Prime Minister Chapaprieta believed that if the bill was rejected, the cabinet would inevitably have to resign, so he advocated withdrawing the bill. However, the majority of cabinet members, including those from the right-wing People's Action Party, preferred to cause a cabinet crisis in order to pass the budget bill before December 31. Therefore, the cabinet's opinions diverged, leading to its dissolution. (Havas, 9th)</p>
<p>Madrid: After the resignation of the Chapaprieta cabinet, President Zamora, based on the results of the Congressional discussions last Saturday and Sunday, which proved that the position of the government's faction of parties (namely, the right-wing Agrarian Party, People's Action Party, Liberal Democratic Party, and the centrist Radical Party) remained firmly unchanged, has followed the approach used to resolve the previous cabinet crisis by consulting with the leaders of the various parties. The leaders of the left-wing opposition parties, former Speaker of the House, Besteiro, and former Prime Minister, Azaña, both suggested to the President that he dissolve the House of Representatives, hold new elections, and form a government of the so-called "Genuine Republican Faction."

<h3 id="e55">London Silver Prices Plunge; Speculation Rises Regarding US Treasury Action; Forewarning of a Change in Silver Purchase Policy <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>(London) Today, the spot price of standard silver fell from 29 and 1875 pence to 28 and 75 pence, and the forward price fell from 28 and 8125 pence to 28 and 375 pence. The recent fall in silver prices is due to the U.S. Treasury Department not purchasing silver sold on the market. The amount sold today was over three million ounces, which is higher than the usual amount sold, but it seems that the U.S. attitude is not due to this. Related brokers also said that it is difficult to understand the reasons for the decision made by the U.S. Some people say that this may be a sign that the U.S. is about to revise its silver policy. (Havas, 9th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Treasury officials are unwilling to discuss the sudden drop in silver prices in the London market. It is currently impossible to ascertain whether the government's silver purchase policy has been abandoned. (National Telegram, 9th)</p>
<p>(New York) The price of silver purchased by the U.S. overseas has been reduced, and the silver market has suddenly changed. The U.S. Treasury Department is unwilling to comment on this. New York silver market merchants are puzzled by the sudden drop in prices. Some merchants expressed their opinion that this is not a sign of a fundamental change in the silver purchase policy, but only an indication that the U.S. Treasury Department is unwilling to continue buying foreign silver at the old prices. The U.S. action does not go against its policy, but only seeks to buy at lower prices. There are still many people speculating about the purpose of the U.S. Treasury Department, but these are purely conjectures. However, the outflow of silver from the Far East has not stopped to this day. It is suspected that the U.S. Treasury Department, in light of this, lowered the purchase price in order to observe its effect on the flow of silver. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<p>(London) The U.S. Treasury Department's action today is considered inexplicable by people in the silver market. Brokers gathered as usual, and each reported receiving a large number of sales commissions, but the U.S. did not buy. Therefore, in order to prevent the collapse of silver prices, it was decided to wait and see whether the U.S. authorities would change their policy. Later, the U.S. instructed brokers to gradually buy when prices fell. By 4:45 p.m., all the sold silver had been absorbed by the U.S. There is a lot of speculation here about today's developments, and it is unknown whether this is a forewarning of a change in the U.S.'s silver purchase policy. People in the silver market are very uneasy and eagerly await an explanation from Washington. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Congressional silver faction members today believed that the low silver prices in the London market were a temporary phenomenon and did not indicate that the U.S. silver purchase policy had changed. Senator Thomas, who returned here today after touring the country, said that the Treasury Department had denied to him that it would withdraw from the London or U.S. silver markets. However, according to his personal opinion, the U.S. would rather give up further purchases in the world market if it did not raise silver prices, because the amount already purchased was sufficient if the U.S. did not use the stored silver for coinage. If the U.S. withdraws from the silver market, the Treasury Department will suffer a great loss, because the Treasury Department has purchased more than 700 million ounces at an average price of 60 cents per ounce. Once it withdraws, the silver price will drop to 40 cents or 35 cents per ounce, Thomas claimed. He said that after Congress reconvenes next January, he will do his best to raise silver prices and will advocate issuing treasury bonds with the Treasury Department's excess gold and silver to pay for veterans' benefits. He believed that the veterans' benefit plan was the only way to increase currency, raise prices, and reduce debt. After the silver price rises to $1.29 per ounce, the price of silver coins will also rise to its proper value, and the government can then issue another 125 million yuan of silver treasury bonds. According to Thomas's estimate, the government's excess gold and silver can issue new currency of 2 billion yuan to pay for benefits, and the Treasury Department can still have 300 million yuan in reserves to prepare for future currency issuance. Thomas predicted that as a result of the official dissemination of Father Coughlin's views, the free currency bill will receive great support next year. The spokesperson of Senator Pittman's Silver Investigation Committee also stated today that the London silver price issue is only a minor aspect of the silver issue. Other experts said that the Treasury Department's current silver purchases have indeed slowed down slightly, because it purchased too much in the second half of November. Treasury officials remained silent about the drop in silver prices, but denied the rumor circulating in New York that the U.S. had withdrawn from the domestic silver market, and said that the Treasury Department's policy on domestic silver had not changed.

<p>(Geneva) Regarding the proposals for resolving the Italian-Abyssinian dispute recently agreed upon by the foreign ministers of Britain and France in Paris, people at the League of Nations here have received informal news and know that this news is definitely not fabricated, which has caused great surprise. Representatives of the majority of member states have expressed surprise at the extent of the concessions made to Italy in these proposals. Scandinavian political figures here declared, "We small countries believe that making concessions to Italy is an inadmissible precedent, because this move is tantamount to approving acts of aggression, and the future is extremely dangerous." People in Central European countries said that if the result of implementing sanctions is only this, then sanctions are not necessary. Furthermore, according to what our reporter knows, if the Anglo-French proposals are submitted to the Executive Council of the League of Nations, many countries will raise objections. (Havas, 10th)</p>
<p>(London) According to various newspapers this morning, the peace plan has caused great concern in all circles of Parliament. The opposition party now plans to demand an explanation from the government on this matter. Liberal MP Sinclair will strongly urge the government not to endorse territorial or economic concessions to Abyssinia that Abyssinia cannot accept. The Times stated that the peace proposals have caused a bad impression in the House of Commons among those who support the government. (Reuters, 10th)</p>
<p>(London) According to what our reporter knows, Prime Minister Baldwin, in view of the fact that various parties and newspapers have mostly expressed opposition to the proposals for resolving the Italian-Abyssinian dispute agreed upon by Foreign Secretary Hoare and French Prime Minister Laval in Paris, suddenly convened a cabinet meeting at noon today after consulting with Minister Without Portfolio Eden to discuss this matter. It is generally believed that Eden and the part of public opinion he represents believe that if the Emperor of Abyssinia refuses to accept these new proposals, then these proposals must be immediately withdrawn. Also, at today's cabinet meeting, Patterson, an expert on the Abyssinian issue from the Foreign Office, also attended and decided that after the cabinet meeting, he would take government instructions to Paris and personally deliver them to Sir Vansittart, the Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. (Havas, 10th)</p>
<p>(London) Prime Minister Baldwin declared in the House of Commons today that the basis of the proposals for resolving the Italian-Abyssinian dispute has not yet been sent to Italy or Abyssinia. Eden, the British minister in charge of League of Nations affairs, is scheduled to go to Geneva tomorrow to attend the Sanctions Committee meeting on Thursday. Eden had a meeting with Prime Minister Baldwin this morning. (Reuters, 10th)</p>
<p>(London) The Cabinet held special meetings twice yesterday afternoon and this morning. Today, according to reliable sources, no decision has yet been made on the peace plan agreed upon by British Foreign Secretary Hoare and French Prime Minister Laval in Paris. No communications have been made with France, Italy, or Abyssinia after the cabinet meeting. The authorities have firmly stated that they will not put pressure on Abyssinia. Yesterday's cabinet meeting lasted from 4:00 p.m. to 7:15 p.m., while today's meeting lasted two full hours. (Reuters, 10th)</p>
<p>(Paris) It is learned that the British Cabinet has endorsed the peace plan agreed upon by British Foreign Secretary Hoare and Laval, but with slight revisions to the details. The British Ambassador to Paris is currently in contact with the French Foreign Office. People in Paris believe that these unimportant differences can be eliminated by any means, and this plan can be announced to Mussolini today. (Reuters, 10th)</p>

<p>(Geneva) Although the 18-nation Small Committee has decided to meet on December 12 no matter what, if Italian Prime Minister Mussolini accepts the Anglo-French proposals before the meeting, then the chairman of the committee, Vasconcelos, will definitely suggest that the meeting date be postponed again. If so, then the chairman of the Executive Council, i.e., the Argentine representative, García, will have to immediately convene the Five-Nation Committee so that the committee can submit a report to the Executive Council, and the Executive Council will discuss it at a meeting on December 17 (Havas, 10th)</p>

<p>(Rome) Diplomats today believe that Mussolini will accept the Anglo-French plan for resolving the Italian-Abyssinian dispute with reservations, but Mussolini's favorable attitude towards this proposal has not yet been confirmed by the Italian Foreign Office. (National Telegram, 9th)</p>
<p>(Rome) Prime Minister Mussolini stated in a speech to the Senate today, "I dare to assure the Senate that Italy's interests in Africa will be vigorously defended." Mussolini did not make any further arguments at the time, so the hope for Franco-British mediation of the Italian-Abyssinian dispute has become stronger. Furthermore, the news broadcast officially by radio included the sentence, "Paris officials expressed their firm belief that Italy can be satisfied with this proposal," which is also very noteworthy. In view of this optimistic atmosphere, people have come to believe that Mussolini will soon instruct the Italian chief representative to the League of Nations, Aloisi, to go to Geneva. (National Telegram, 9th)</p>
<p>(Rome) According to what our reporter knows, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini may accept the Anglo-French proposals for a peaceful resolution of the Italian-Abyssinian dispute in principle and use them as a basis for negotiation. However, it is expected that these negotiations will not only take a very long time but will also be very thorny. It is generally believed that the objections that Italy may raise to the Anglo-French proposals will be limited to the following points: (1) Italy insists that the so-called Abyssinian outlet to the sea must be chosen in the territory of the Italian colony and can only be designated as a free port for Abyssinia to access the sea, and cannot be a territorial concession to Abyssinia. (2) The Italian troops who have already entered Abyssinian territory will not be allowed to withdraw under any circumstances. Therefore, Italy will inevitably demand full sovereignty over all occupied areas, while in the Anglo-French proposals, it seems that only a portion of the Tigray Province land will be allowed to be ceded. (3) Italy has always wanted to open a corridor between the two Italian colonies of Eritrea and Somaliland so that they can be connected to each other. Therefore, although Italy can give up its claim to occupy the entire Harar province, it is expected that it will still insist on controlling most of the land in the province so that traffic between the Ogaden region and the Danakil region can be unimpeded, thereby realizing Italy's plan to connect the above two colonies. (5) Regarding the Abyssinian mainland, although Britain and France also advocate implementing an international mutual assistance plan, Italy seems to demand that it retain special influence in this mutual assistance system and that the Abyssinian Emperor be forced to accept this mutual assistance plan. The above are the opinions that Italy may raise on the Anglo-French proposals, but these formal proposals have not yet been sent to the Italian government, only informal news has been received from the Italian Embassy in France.

<p>Gold and Silver</p>
<p>British Gold: The London gold price today was 141 shillings and lost half a penny.</p>
<p>British Silver: The London silver price is not expected to be quoted until 4:15 PM at the earliest. The price may fall slightly due to a large number of sales. However, it is impossible to predict how much it will fall, as there is no news about Washington's attitude.</p>
<p>American Silver: The Mount Lyell silver price opened down about 200 pounds, due to a large number of sales, and there were no purchases from the United States in London.</p>
<p>Exchange Rates</p>
<p>British-American: The London foreign exchange market was stable this morning. The price of the pound has a slightly stronger trend. The opening price of the British-American exchange rate was 4.92875 yuan, 0.0125 lower than yesterday's American-British closing price. Within the first hour, it rose 0.000625, at noon it rose 0.0125, at 1 PM it rose another 0.0125, and at 2 PM it continued to rise 0.000625, reaching 4.9325 yuan.</p>
<p>British-French: The opening price was 74.75 francs, up 4 pounds. Within the first hour, it rose 3 pounds, at noon it rose 4 pounds, and at 2 PM it rose another 2 pounds, reaching 74.78 francs.</p>
<p>Cotton and Wheat</p>
<p>American Cotton: The New York cotton market did not move at the opening. Although the Liverpool market was loose, it did not affect the market price here. There was a slight upward trend after the opening, with traders buying, but operators remained hesitant, waiting for the Supreme Court's decision on the legality of handling fees. It is said that the American Cotton Public Storage Agency has a reserve of 900,000 bales, which is more than generally expected. This is also one of the reasons for the sluggish cotton market.</p>
<p>American Cotton: Liverpool cotton prices fell slightly, due to the extremely disappointing US government cotton production estimate released yesterday, and the news that the US cotton farmers' public storage agency's reserves were thicker than expected. At 1 PM, the January contract fell 11 pounds to 6.33.</p>
<p>British Wheat: The Liverpool wheat market was quiet this morning. Although the news of a large sale of Australian wheat to Japan before noon offset the disappointing news from overseas, the wheat price here this morning was still lower than yesterday. At 1 PM, the December contract price was 5 shillings and 11 pence, down 1.25 pence.</p>
<p>American Wheat: The Chicago wheat market fell slightly at the opening due to poor Liverpool telegrams, but the price quickly rebounded due to increased Australian wheat shipments to the Far East and purchases by flour manufacturers. The feed market was stable, with no price changes.</p>
<p>Rubber</p>
<p>London: London rubber opened stable. The April-June contract price did not move, remaining at 6.5 pence. At noon, it turned quiet, and the price loosened 0.0625 to 6.4375 pence.</p>
<p>New York: New York rubber fell slightly at the opening due to looser London telegrams, but the price stabilized after purchases by traders and speculators.</p>
<p>Securities</p>
<p>New York: The New York stock market had a very weak opening trend this morning. Many stocks that had risen sharply recently fell by more than one dollar. Copper and metal stocks were weak, automobile stocks loosened, railway stocks fell slightly, and public utility stocks, oil stocks, department stores, and entertainment stocks were stable. The Dow Jones 30 industrial stock average opened at 143.96, down 14 pounds. The prices are as follows:</p>

<p>Tax Bureau and Unified Tax Bureau Occupied; Over 70,000 Yuan of Unified Tax Collected</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: Since Yin Rugeng's betrayal, the magistrates and public security chiefs of the counties in eastern Luan have refused to join the rebellion. Those who managed to escape the war zone and report to the province, as well as those who could not escape, were forced to temporarily obey the puppet organization. However, they have not severed ties with the provincial authorities, and they still accept orders mailed from the province, but they record them in a separate book to distinguish them from the puppet Anti-Communist Committee. Those that do not conflict with the puppet organization are still followed, such as the evaluation committees of the counties, which were established under the orders of the province. The postal and telecommunications agencies in eastern Hebei have special commissioners stationed to inspect them. Recently, Ning County Magistrate Chen Zanyu secretly reported news to the province, which was discovered. The report was made to Zhang Yantian, the commander of the Second Security Brigade stationed at the Liushou Camp. When Chen disguised himself and accompanied two followers through the Liushou Camp, intending to board a car to Baoding to escape the scope of the puppet organization, he was intercepted and detained by Zhang's troops and reported to Yin Rugeng. Yin ordered Zhang to send someone to Tongxian for disposition. Seeing this, officials in other counties adopted a policy of self-preservation and dared not act rashly. The office of the Puppet Eastern Hebei Anti-Communist Autonomous Committee established in Tangshan is under the command of Yin Tixin, the director of the puppet office, and governs the territory under the jurisdiction of the former Eastern Hebei Administrative District Commissioner's Office. The tax collection agencies in the counties have all been seized. Yin also reorganized the Tangshan Unified Tax Management Office into the Puppet Eastern Luan Unified Tax Bureau, the Hebei Province Third District Tobacco and Alcohol License Levy Bureau into the Puppet Eastern Hebei Tobacco and Alcohol License Levy Bureau, and the Tangshan Tax Collection Bureau was expanded into the Puppet Eastern Luan Tax Collection Bureau. All original staff members of the tax bureaus were detained and forced to work. Therefore, since the 29th of last month, tax collection has begun. Among them, the unified tax alone has collected 60,000 to 70,000 yuan. The Tangshan unified tax includes the Kailuan coal tax, Qixin Cement Company cement tax, Huaxin Spinning Mill yarn tax, and Decheng Flour Company flour tax, totaling about 280,000 yuan per month. Among them, the Kailuan mine tax accounts for about 150,000 yuan, and the Qixin cement tax accounts for about 120,000 yuan. Since the puppet unified tax bureau began collecting taxes, the factories and companies have had to allow the puppet organization to levy taxes in order to maintain shipments. However, most of the Kailuan mine tax is directly paid to the Hebei-Chahar-Suiyuan-Shanxi Unified Tax Administration in Peiping. Those shipped outside the war zone still pay taxes in Peiping as before. Only those sold within the war zone have to pay taxes to the puppet organization. The Ministry of Finance previously ordered all personnel of the Tangshan Unified Tax Management Office to withdraw and work in Tianjin due to the occupation of the office, and ordered the Tianjin Unified Tax Management Office to assist in relocating tax collection. Recently, because all personnel of the Tangshan office were detained, and the factories and companies opposed re-levying taxes in a different location because they had already paid the unified tax within the Tangshan factory, this matter was not carried out. The Malan Valley and Gubeikou unified tax sub-cards have not yet been received by the puppet organization because there is no one available. Customs tax cards at other passes on the Great Wall are operating as usual. The puppet side has not interfered due to special relations. (8th)</p>
<h3 id="e96">Rigorous Rural Clearance in Eastern Shandong <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>Red Bandit Leaders Captured and Executed; Anti-Bandit Work in Various Counties Very Active</p>
<p>Weixian Correspondence: The Red Bandits in eastern Shandong are stirring. Han Fuqu, the chairman of the provincial government, sent Zhang Shutang's division to suppress them and telegraphed Chairman Chiang to report. It is said that Chairman Chiang's reply was received a few days ago, instructing them to quickly extinguish the flames and not allow them to spread. Recently, Han believed that although the bandits numbered several thousand, 90% were coerced civilians, and it would not be difficult to suppress them. Rural clearance is most important. He ordered Zhang Shutang to conscientiously carry it out. According to recent news of bandit suppression, in addition to the coerced civilians joining the bandits, the lurking bandits in the vicinity have also responded, using the names of the pseudo-China Shandong Red Army First Route Commander, Second Route Commander, and pseudo-Central Soviet Special Liaison Officer. Their base appears to still be located in more than a dozen villages at the junction of Muping and Haiyang counties, such as Tonghai Village, Wuji Village, Xia Village, Songjiao Village, and Duanjia Village. After Zhang Shutang convened a rural clearance meeting with the county magistrates in Laiyang a few days ago, he moved to Haiyang to command Zhao Tingbi's regiment to advance south from Muping. On the evening of the 4th of this month, Zhao's regiment suddenly surrounded villages such as Tonghai and Songjiao. Although the bandits resisted, their actual strength and guns were only several hundred. The rest were earthen guns and swords, so they were defeated like melting snow. The government troops recovered Tonghai Village. In addition to killing more than 30 bandits on the spot, more than 100 were captured alive and sent to Haiyang. Banners, official seals, and many books and leaflets inciting the people were also found. After Zhang interrogated the captured bandits, Wang Wenlan and Duan Chengzhai, the so-called Red Army commanders, were among them, as well as more than 20 female party members, all of whom confessed without denial. Zhang then telegraphed Han Fuqu. Han believed that the bandit leaders should be executed on the spot, and intellectuals should be killed without mercy. Those who were truly blindly following would be allowed to be released on bail. Therefore, their leaders have all been executed and their bodies are displayed on the main roads of Tonghai, Wuji, and other villages. Many of the female bandits had short hair, unbound feet, and modern clothes, which are not commonly seen in remote counties on weekdays. Tai Xinran, the director of the Shidao long-distance telephone bureau, also joined the bandits, and his guarantor has also been shot. Zhang Shutang has now moved from Haiyang to Xia Village to convene a meeting with the people and will inspect Wendeng County again in a few days. The road from Yantai to Xia Village was originally a motor road, but troops from the 81st Division are now stationed at various important stations. The Yantai Red Swastika Society has set out to provide relief in villages such as Tonghai. The remaining bandits scattered in various counties are being searched, and rural clearance is being actively carried out, with strict household registration checks. In addition to Zhang Shutang stationed in Xia Village and Zhao Tingbi's regiment stationed in Tonghai Village, Brigade Commander Yun Qichang is currently stationed in Rongcheng, and Brigade Commander Tang Bangzhi is currently stationed in Wendeng. Zhang Xiangwu, the commander of the Fifth Route Militia, was also ordered to assist in the suppression. Zhang arrived in Yantai from Pingdu on the 5th and immediately transferred to the territory of Qixia County. Also, since the 81st Division set off to suppress the bandits, the defense area of Qixia County that they left behind is now being taken over by Gu Liangmin's troops of the 22nd Division.</p>
<p>The anti-bandit situation in various counties in eastern Shandong is also very active at present. (1) Muping County: Brigade Commander Yun Qichang set off from Muping. He paid special attention to Songjiao Village, where the bandit leader Wang Wenlan was located, and Duanjia Village, where the bandit leader Duan Chengzhai was located. As for the bandits in various places, in addition to those killed on the spot, all those captured alive were interrogated, and if they belonged to a certain village, they were sent back to that village for execution to serve as a warning. The large group of bandits was defeated long ago and scattered in all directions. Gaoling Qujia in the southwest of the county was attacked by fleeing bandits again on the night of the 4th, who set fires to show their might. The villagers were confused and mostly fled to neighboring villages, and the situation was very chaotic. The number of bandits is still unclear. (2) Wendeng County: Slogans and leaflets were found in the county a few days ago, and the city gates were immediately closed with sand and soil, leaving only the east gate open for traffic, with extremely strict inspections to prevent accidents. Before long, bandits rioted in Guoge Village in the east of the city. The county magistrate ordered the Lian Zhuang Hui Ding to bravely encircle and suppress the bandits, killing several bandits before they fled. Now it is peaceful as usual. (3) Haiyang County: Guocheng, the fourth district of the county, is the most prosperous village. Recently, it planned to hold the anniversary of the establishment of the Jinde Branch Association. While preparations were underway, more than 40 bandits with complete guns surrounded the village a few days ago. The Lian Zhuang Hui closed the village gates to resist, and the Lian Zhuang Hui of nearby villages also came to rescue. They attacked from both inside and outside, and the bandits fled. Four bandits were killed and one was captured alive. Since hearing about the bandit riots, Dazhuang Xia Village in the east of the county has closed its doors, leaving only one door open for entry and exit. The Lian Zhuang Hui Ding is on guard day and night, and inspections of pedestrians are very strict. (4) Fushan County: County Magistrate Li Shusen, fearing that the bandit riots in various places would affect public security, ordered each of the five major districts to select 100 strong men. A few were left in the county seat for support, while the rest were assigned to defend each district. Because Shihuikouzi in the south of the port is an important avenue to Laiyang and Haiyang and has a relatively important location, in addition to stationing 20 to 30 people in the village, 80 people are stationed in Huangwu Village, 10 miles south, all under the command of Qu Shaofu, the head of the Second Lian Zhuang Branch Association. If the bandits flee north, they will be attacked head-on. (9th)</p>
<h3 id="e97">Jiading: Student Police Arbitrarily Arrest Vocational School Principal <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>The four towns of this city were ordered to carry out compulsory literacy education. Twenty literacy classes for the public were set up throughout the city and opened on the 5th of this month. Classes began on the night of the 6th. The county-run commercial vocational school independently managed one class. On the 6th and 7th, only a dozen students attended. According to regulations, the names of absent students were filled out on a form and sent to the town office, which then asked the Public Security Bureau to send police to force them to attend school. On the evening of the 8th, half an hour after class time had passed, only three students had arrived. Principal Pan Sigui telegraphed the town office to decide whether or not to hold class. The town office replied to dispose of it as appropriate, so he announced that class would be suspended today due to the small number of students. As the students were leaving, Wang Yifei, the squad leader of the student police class of the County Public Security Bureau, thought that the school should not dismiss the students who had been urged by the Public Security Bureau to attend class. He invited his classmates to return to the vocational school and rant at the school. Principal Pan explained the situation, but they ignored him. Then, he returned to the bureau and led a dozen classmates to guard the gates of the vocational school. Falsely claiming that it was the order of the director, they arrested Principal Pan. Pan asked for an arrest warrant, but the other police officers immediately stepped forward and forcibly dragged Pan into the bureau. The students in the literacy class at the school were also arrested and taken to the bureau. After entering the bureau, they privately beat Pan for about half an hour. Chen Youmin, the director of the bureau, returned to the bureau from outside and finally invited Pan into the reception room and said that the arrest was a false claim by Officer Wang and that there was no order. He apologized to Pan and said that he would severely punish Officer Wang and personally sent Pan back to school. The next morning, the education community heard the news that the student police of this county had repeatedly caused trouble illegally, causing public resentment. This time, they even falsely claimed an order and arbitrarily arrested the principal of a secondary school and illegally beat him within the bureau. The highest public security agency in the county had no discipline. At 1 PM, after gathering at the Educational Association, they elected 20 representatives, including Lü Yunbiao and Wang Xuanpu, to petition the county government for: (1) Punishing Officer Wang Yifei, who caused the incident illegally, dismissing him from public office, and never employing him again. (2) Severely punishing Public Security Director Chen Youmin for tolerating illegal police conduct. (3) Guaranteeing the safety of educators. County Magistrate Xu expressed his willingness to accommodate them. On the one hand, the teachers of various schools in this city who were teaching in the literacy classes jointly resigned to the town office. Town Chief Pu Juling tried his best to persuade them to stay and promised to be responsible for negotiating. At about 5 PM, County Magistrate Xu asked Huang Shizuo, the head of the first district, to report to the Educational Association that the first and second requests could be granted. The second request was changed to Director Chen apologizing in writing to the literacy education committee of the four towns, and he repeatedly asked the teachers to continue teaching. The teachers agreed to continue teaching for the time being to see what would happen. However, as of the time the reporter was writing the manuscript, the county government had not yet fulfilled the aforementioned items.</p>

<p>The Taicang City People's Education Center includes a sports field of more than 20 mu, a park of more than 30 mu, and a library of more than 40,000 volumes. Since Zhou Dagang, a graduate of Daxia University, took over as director, he has been engaged in internal reorganization, such as cataloging books, repairing pavilions, and rebuilding practice buildings. He feels that the general amateur public in Taicang City has little interest in sports, so he is holding a public amateur ball game championship. It is stipulated that each agency's staff must participate in at least one competition. To promote general enthusiasm, six championships have been prepared, such as County Magistrate Wen's Chongxin Cup (basketball), County Party Department Standing Committee Member Huang's Yinyi Cup, Military Affairs Director Yuan's Kejian Cup, Education Bureau Director Guan's Jingcheng Cup (table tennis), Public Security Director Dong's Xueshu Cup (women's basketball), and People's Education Center Director Zhou Dagang's Dagang Cup (women's table tennis).

Chen Wencui and Zhang Xinchang also resigned for two months, but Lao still reported it for February. There is a Public Security Bureau salary list as proof, which clearly shows embezzlement. When questioned, Lao Keming only claimed that the plaintiff's statement was completely fabricated, but he provided no evidence to the contrary. He was ordered to provide a written guarantee of 1,000 yuan. Lao had no guarantor and was detained.</p>

<p>Ling Rongchang, a resident of Yingqiao Lane, in the city, worked in the Taibo Urban Area Office and was 37 years old. His second wife, Yao, was 32 years old and had two boys, the elder named Qiuquan, 3 years old, and the younger named Panquan, 2 years old. The couple often quarreled. The night before last (9th), Ling Rongchang went to Yingyetin in the suburbs to take a bath and did not return home until 11 PM. After entering the room, he saw that his two sons had blood flowing profusely from their necks, and Yao was also lying in a pool of blood. There was also a kitchen knife beside her head. He was extremely shocked and shouted loudly. He immediately asked Western doctor Wu Shisheng to come to his home for emergency treatment. The necks of the two children had been severed and they had already died. Yao was still breathing and was immediately sent to the Brothers Hospital for treatment. It is said that her throat had been severed. Hong Houchang, the director of the Public Security First Branch Bureau in charge of the area, heard the report and arrived at the scene. He briefly questioned Ling at the bureau and ordered him to return home, and sent police to guard Ling's home. At 10 AM yesterday, Huang Rongzhao, the head of the Northwest Third District, and Huang Bingjun, the head of the Northwest Fifth District, along with his colleagues, the owner Ling Rongchang, and his elder brother Shi Huang, went to the District Court to request an exemption from the autopsy.

<p>Xiao Jie, the head of Huaiqiao Township in the ninth district of Jiangdu, and Xiao Zhenyang, the head of the fourth bao, had long been at odds. On the morning of the 8th, Xiao Jie led more than thirty people, each carrying kitchen knives, iron rulers, wooden sticks, and other implements, to attack the Jucaiyuan Teahouse run by Xiao Zhenyang. Seeing the situation was unfavorable, Xiao Zhenyang fled. When tea drinkers Chen Guoan and Wu Xueyin stepped forward to dissuade them, they provoked their anger. They were dragged to the north of Dajie Bridge and beaten severely, with kitchen knives used to slash four parts of Chen Guoan's head, the most severe wound being a four-inch-long cut on his forehead. Wu Xueyin was also seriously injured. They hired lawyer Li Xiangfu to file a complaint with the District Procuratorate for an examination. Due to the weekly holiday, the examination was postponed to around 7 a.m. on the 9th. Because Chen Guoan's injuries were too severe, it was not convenient to transport him for examination in the wind, which could lead to unexpected danger.

<h3 id="e106">Compulsory Education (1) <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>— Gu Shusen, Director of the General Education Department of the Ministry of Education</p>
<p>The topic I am talking about today is "Compulsory Education."</p>
<p>Before I begin, please think about what is called "Compulsory Education."</p>
<p>The meaning of so-called compulsory education is that the state uses law to stipulate that all people have an absolute obligation to provide their children or the children under their protection with education for a certain period of time within a certain age range. This is called compulsory education. This kind of law stipulates that people have the obligation to educate their children, and if they cannot comply, the government can enforce it according to law. Therefore, this kind of compulsory education is also called enforced education.</p>
<p>We might think, why does the state use law to stipulate that people must provide their children with a certain amount of education within a certain age? I think everyone can understand this meaning. It is because people become knowledgeable through education, their thinking becomes agile, their judgment of things becomes accurate, they understand etiquette, they understand the principles of being a person, and their personalities become noble. When people receive a certain amount of education in their childhood, they will naturally have a career when they grow up. Since they have a decent career in life, they will naturally be law-abiding and will not do evil. Then, the number of bad elements in society can be reduced, and society can be stabilized as a result. Furthermore, when education is popularized in a country, the knowledge of the people will naturally increase, and social undertakings will naturally develop. How can a country not be rich and strong? In short, to demand progress in people's knowledge, development in social undertakings, stability in order, and even the wealth and strength of the country, all depend on promoting compulsory education. Therefore, civilized countries around the world must use law to stipulate that people must provide their children with a certain amount of education.</p>
<p>According to what I said earlier: compulsory education is an obligation that people should fulfill to the country, and regardless of poverty or wealth, intelligence or stupidity, everyone should receive equal education. However, the scope of education is very broad, from kindergarten to elementary school, middle school, and even university. Everyone should have the opportunity to enjoy education. Then, the scope of compulsory education seems impossible to limit to elementary school. Regarding this point, if we only speak from the perspective of equal educational opportunities, or even the benefits of education for society and the country, of course, the wider the scope of compulsory education, the better. However, implementing education at all levels throughout the country requires huge expenses. Expanding the scope of compulsory education naturally requires more funding. Therefore, the first condition for the state to use law to define the scope of compulsory education must be to examine the economic capacity of the country and the people. Furthermore, if the scope of compulsory education is to be expanded, the length of time children spend in school receiving education must also be extended. If the living conditions of the general population in the country are very difficult, how can they afford to have their children receive education for a very long time? Therefore, the second condition for defining the scope of compulsory education must be to examine the living conditions of society and the people. In addition to these two conditions, the scope of compulsory education should not only be defined as very small and low at the beginning, but the time limit should also be very short. Later, after the implementation has had a certain effect, the scope should be gradually expanded and the time limit lengthened. Examining the results of compulsory education in various countries around the world, some started with very short time limits. Those with long time limits turned out to be implemented more slowly, while those with short time limits gradually increased the time limit and turned out to be faster. In short, the implementation of compulsory education must have a certain history before the level of education can be gradually improved and the time limit gradually lengthened. This is the second condition for defining the scope of compulsory education.</p>
<p>Now I can briefly report the general situation of compulsory education in various countries around the world for reference and comparison:</p>
<p>Germany was the first country to implement compulsory education. In 1619, the city of Weimar issued an order forcing citizens to send their children to school. Later, Gotha, Saxony, Bavaria, Baden and other places followed suit. In 1763, the Prussian king at the time, Frederick the Great, defeated France and Austria. He knew that compulsory education was very important, so he clearly stipulated compulsory school attendance measures. All Prussian citizens, from the age of five to thirteen or fourteen, who did not obey the order to attend school would have their parents or guardians fined. The implementation of compulsory education in Germany can be said to have been established at that time. In 1851, it was officially stipulated in the constitution. They defined the compulsory education period as eight years. The compulsory education funds used were raised locally, accounting for about eight-tenths, and government subsidies accounted for about two-tenths. After the European War, the government reorganized, local taxes were abolished, and all were changed to national taxes. As a result, all compulsory education funds were borne by the state. The level of compulsory education development in their country has reached its peak because of its long history, and everyone has received education. However, examining their past statistics: In 1894, the places where they had been implementing compulsory education for the longest time had a history of forty years. However, at that time, the statistics of the number of school-age children enrolled in schools nationwide only reached 33 percent. If we think about this carefully, this proves that if the compulsory education period is set too long, the effect of implementation will be relatively slow.</p>
<p>The motivation for France to implement compulsory education was launched in 1792. The initial compulsory school attendance period was set at three years. In 1887, after being defeated by Prussia, it formally stipulated compulsory measures, requiring all children aged six to thirteen to receive compulsory education and exempting them from tuition fees. Since then, their compulsory education has become more complete. After the European War, the school attendance period was changed to eight years. Since 1882, the compulsory education funds for their country have been such that the salaries of all elementary school teachers have been entirely borne by the central government, and the expenses borne by local areas are only sporadic expenses such as school repairs and student supplies. They have put a lot of effort into compulsory education facilities. However, there are still many illiterate people, as evidenced by the use of marks instead of signatures in marriage registration books, which shows that their compulsory education has not yet reached the highest level.</p>
<p>The compulsory education situation in England has always been biased towards freedom and development, so private schools are very developed. It was not until 1870 that a law was enacted to implement compulsory education, and the unified implementation of compulsory education can be said to have started at this time. The length of their compulsory education school attendance period has been set at nine years since the European War. The compulsory education funds borne by the central government have also increased to one-half since the European War, and the remaining one-half is still borne by local areas. Although the compulsory education period they stipulated is very long, and the unified and compulsory implementation is also very late, the foundation of past educational development is very solid, so now, nine years of compulsory education can be said to have been popularized.</p>
<p>Compulsory education in the United States was initially stipulated by the people of Massachusetts that parents had the obligation to send their children to school. It was not until 1825 that it was enacted by law and promoted throughout the province. Later, various provinces followed suit. According to a survey in 1927, there were already twenty provinces. Their compulsory education period varies from province to province. Most of them are from the age of seven to sixteen, and some provinces are only five years. Now, the average statistics of the number of enrolled children nationwide show that the number of enrolled children has reached 94 percent of school-age children. The compulsory education funds in their country are borne by the provincial governments, ranging from 20 to 60 percent. The central government also gives a large amount of official wasteland to local areas as a fund for compulsory education.</p>
<p>Japan began implementing compulsory education in 1872. Their school system stipulates that one elementary school district should be established for every 600 people, and children over the age of six must attend school. It was implemented simultaneously throughout the country. Their compulsory education funds have always been entirely borne by local governments. It was not until the seventh year of the Taisho era that the central government allocated funds for subsidies. The length of their compulsory education education period is six years, but in the first ten years or so, children only attended school for four months each year. Once sixteen months were satisfied, the education period was considered to have ended. Later, the number of days in school each year was gradually increased, and it was not until after the 33rd year of the Meiji era that it was uniformly required to be satisfied for four years.</p>
<p>Although the above-mentioned situations of the implementation of compulsory education in various countries are only five countries, it is enough for us to know the importance of urgently promoting compulsory education. We should all think deeply about why we should urgently promote compulsory education. Regarding this aspect, I also have to say a few words:</p>
<p>First, although our Chinese nation has a large population and a long history, perhaps because of the vast land and abundant resources and the obstruction of mountains and rivers, not only does each province have its own customs, habits, and languages, but even each county and each place has its own customs, habits, and languages. No wonder the people are gradually being divided and dispersed, like a plate of loose sand, difficult to unite. If we want to remedy this drawback, unite the national people and revitalize our inherent national spirit, we can only promote compulsory education, increase national awareness, improve closed customs, eliminate bad habits, and unify different languages to create a solid and united Greater Chinese nation. This is the first point of urgently needing to promote compulsory education.</p>
<p>Second, if we examine the most recent education statistics, we can know that the number of illiterate people accounts for more than 80 percent of the total population, and the number of enrolled children only accounts for 23 percent of the number of school-age children. We think that it is very difficult to train so many illiterate people to exercise their four rights, cultivate their political ability, and prepare them to be qualified as citizens. And the future illiterate people will be allowed to be produced in large numbers batch after batch. How terrible is this? Therefore, urgently promoting compulsory education, cultivating healthy future people, and cultivating them to be qualified as citizens is really a fundamental work.</p>
<p>Third, seeing the scene of declining production, rural bankruptcy, and the poverty of the people's livelihood in various parts of the country, I especially feel twelve points of fear. If we use the perspective of education to observe the root causes of why they have been caught in this situation, it is all because education is not widespread, so the people's production skills cannot be improved, and they are economically invaded by foreign countries, which leads to an irreversible situation. Therefore, although the current rescue plans must be planned, the fundamental method relies entirely on the power of education to remedy it. In this way, promoting compulsory education is really urgently needed.</p>
<p>The three points mentioned earlier are the major reasons why we urgently need to promote compulsory education. There is also a need to report on the process of our country's promotion of compulsory education, the status of the implementation of compulsory education in various provinces and cities this year, and the opinions on promoting compulsory education, which I will talk about next time.</p>

<h3 id="e120">Silver Trade Association Re-submits Request to Ministry of Finance Regarding Silver Usage, Chemical Silver is No Different From Artificial Silk, Fu Sheng-mao Speaks Out on its Evils <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>Kuo Wen News Agency reports that the Silver Trade Association of this city has yesterday specially resubmitted a request to the Ministry of Finance regarding the silver usage issue in the industry, the original submission reads, this request concerns the silver usage management regulations, which have caused obstacles in both the work and business of the silver trade, in accordance with the provisions of Article 11, we request permission to continue to use silver with a purity of 88 percent, please approve the filing. Your humble association submitted a request to the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce last month, which was forwarded to your ministry, to allow the silver trade to continue to manufacture with the old composition percentage in accordance with the provisions of Article 11 of the management regulations, and we have been waiting patiently until now without any instructions. The members of your association are in a state of trepidation. If the regulations promulgated by the ministry can be followed with some effort, your members, although merchants, would not dare to lag behind others in patriotism, and would not repeatedly urge you. In fact, the silver trade has always been named after silver, and the manufacture of ornaments should be based on silver. If copper seven and silver three are used as raw materials, the nature of the product will be very hard, and it will easily break when struck. The silver trade is limited by manual techniques, and it is difficult to create good products. Moreover, the ministry has stipulated that chemical silver should be used as raw material, but our country does not have this kind of quality, and if we seek to purchase it from foreign countries, funds will have to flow out again, so saving money will turn into outflows. Your ministry's restriction on the silver content of silverware is intended to prevent the leakage of silver abroad, but our industry, in addition to manufacturing various utensils and ornaments, does not sell raw silver. The manufacture of utensils and ornaments requires labor costs and decoration fees for each tael of silver, which is about three or four yuan in legal tender. There are also the joint guarantee in Article 5 of the same rules and the punishment rules in Article 9. Since there is no profit to be made, even the most foolish person would never do this illegal thing. Moreover, although the silver products are taken from the country, they are actually scattered among the people, circulating back and forth, and still do not leave the country. People who hold them can redeem or pawn them in times of emergency, and can buy or redeem them in times of affluence, and the livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of silver trade workers can be maintained. If there is no flow of silver products in our country, imported goods will inevitably replace them, and in the future, what is distributed among the people will all be imported goods, and the outflow of rights and interests can be imagined. Observing the seizure of the porcelain industry and the invasion of the silk industry, major impacts have occurred on the country and industry and commerce. Today's so-called chemical silver is no different from artificial silk. Therefore, the members of your association unanimously appeal, requesting the minister to think of the livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of industrial and commercial people, and quickly approve the use of silver regulations Article 11 "but the book" stipulates, still containing 88% pure silver, to approve the filing, so that commerce can be maintained, workers will not lose their jobs, without harm to the country and benefit to the people, I beg the minister to observe and approve the implementation, it is convenient for the public, respectfully presented to the Minister of Finance Kong."</p>
<p>The reporter visited Mr. Fu Shengmao, chairman of the association, yesterday and conducted the following Q&amp;A. Reporter asks, (hereinafter referred to as question) When did the silver trade begin? Mr. Fu replied, (hereinafter referred to as answer) The silver trade began in the Jin and Tang dynasties, so our industry has a slogan: "Tang makeup, Jin decoration." At that time, jewelry was the main body, and the Ming and Qing dynasties were the most prosperous. In recent times, there have been utensils, dressing tables, etc., and since the Republic of China, gifts have been the most important. (Question) How much silver does the silver trade use each year? (Answer) In the past three years, the average number of pulls has been about 400,000 taels of pure silver each year, but this is limited to members of the association. The number of silver shops that have not joined the association is several hundred, and the amount of silver used is about the same as that of the members. (Question) Can silver products be profited by transporting them out of the country? (Answer) The labor cost of silver products is very large. Once it becomes a vessel, labor costs and decoration fees must be added. Each tael of silver is at least about three or four yuan in legal tender. Not only is there no profit to be made, but also losses are many. (Question) Then, is the raw material that has not been made into a vessel sold? (Answer) The silver trade has never sold silver ingots as raw materials. It is safe to operate a business and strictly abide by the law. The members of the current trade association are willing to abide by Article 5 of the Finance Department's Management Regulations to jointly and severally guarantee and take joint responsibility. (Question) Are there any foreign silver factories? (Answer) There are silver manufacturing plants in various countries in the East and West. The products are mainly wine utensils, tea utensils and tableware, followed by display items, and then jewelry. The products are mainly plain, and delicate patterns are rare, because they all use electric machines instead of manual labor. Now, jewelry in our country is also decreasing year by year, which is related to the impact of women cutting their hair. (Question) What is the composition of foreign silverware? (Answer) The silver content of foreign silverware is about 70 percent, but our industry never accepts exchanges, because there is no deep experience, and we are especially afraid of causing disputes. (Question) What exactly is the so-called chemical silver? (Answer) Our industry is sticking to the old ways and does not know what chemical silver is. Moreover, our country does not have this kind of raw material now, otherwise, we can only purchase it from foreign firms, and then funds will have to flow out, and it is not suitable for the technical raw materials of handicrafts. (Question) If the silver trade does not manufacture utensils, is there a possibility that imported goods will replace them? (Answer) If our industry does not produce silver utensils, imported products of so-called chemical silver will take the opportunity to enter, win by surprise, and sell as much as possible, subtly changing habits, and once they become old, they will become waste. There will be a huge leak, and the country and the people will suffer. Looking at the porcelain industry and the silk industry, they have become the master of the house. Can we not be filled with emotion? Chemical silver is no different from artificial silk. Once it is harmed, it is impossible to stop. It is saving money but making it overflow. (Question) Now the Ministry of Finance stipulates that the pure silver content of silver products is 30 percent. Can it be made? (Answer) If it is based on the provisions of Article 2 of the Finance Department's Silver Usage Regulations, it is impossible to work, because copper seven and silver three, its nature becomes hard, our industry is completely made by hand, and once struck, it will inevitably be broken, its color cannot be white, and the issue of credibility is even more unnecessary. Therefore, the silver trade across the country has requested the Ministry of Finance to amend Article 2 of the Management Regulations and requested the approval of Article 11 "but the book". This association has also submitted two requests to the Ministry of Finance, but has not yet received approval. (Question) What is the relationship between the silver trade and the national parties? (Answer) The foundation of a country is stable, depending on whether industry and commerce are developed or not. In all countries, the business is to lead the way, and our country is called a country based on agriculture, and it is also heard to promote industry and commerce recently. Our industry is one of the industries that attach importance to both industry and commerce. Although there is no possibility of selling to foreign countries, it is also enough to settle the people's livelihood in one industry in the country. Production and sales, huge capital, its raw materials are taken from the country, (now allowed to supply the central bank) and scattered among the people, circulating back and forth, does not leave the country, gold is also silver, once it enters the people, it becomes a kind of small savings, which can be exchanged and pawned in times of emergency, and purchased and redeemed in times of affluence, directly and indirectly hundreds of thousands of workers rely on it to maintain their lives, the country has no unemployed people, and society has no hungry and cold people, so our industry is actually beneficial and harmless to the people of both countries.</p>

<p>The cotton yarn industry in this city is in a state of decline. After the Shenxin No. 2 and No. 5 factories, operated by Rong Zongjing, suffered excessive losses and officially announced their closure, unemployed workers have repeatedly petitioned party and government agencies to seek relief. The Central News Agency reporter specifically asked Rong Zongjing about the rumored meeting that Deputy Minister Liu Weichi of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce will convene with industry giants from the financial and cotton yarn industries to discuss solutions. According to Rong, he had not heard of any meeting. The cotton yarn market is still in decline, and the closure of the Shenxin No. 2 and No. 5 factories cannot be sustained. Previously, he had visited Minister Kong to request the establishment of a special bank to allow industry and commerce to mortgage loans and use funds for development, so as to avoid the suffering of inflexible capital turnover. Minister Kong agreed to postpone the plan for implementation. Therefore, in order to seek relief and development, it is necessary to provide economic circulation.</p>

<h3 id="e126">Unified Text Telegraph Regulations; Officially Implemented on the First Day of Next Month; Ministry of Communications Instructs Telegraph Bureaus to Comply <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>In order to expedite the sending and receiving of military and political telegrams and improve the operations of various bureaus, the Ministry of Communications has drafted seven articles of unified text telegraph regulations and submitted them to the National Government for instructions to all military and political agencies to comply starting from January 1 of next year. Yesterday, the Telegraph Bureau in this city was ordered to comply. A reporter from the Industrial News Agency inquired about the regulations from the bureau yesterday: (1) Telegrams with the same text sent to multiple receiving locations are called unified text telegrams. (2) The names of the locations in a unified text telegram cannot be listed together. Each telegram can only contain one receiving location. If telegrams are sent to multiple locations, they should be divided into multiple copies. (3) When a unified text telegram is submitted to the telegraph bureau for transmission, only one copy needs to contain the complete text. The remaining copies can specify the receiving location and the name and address of the recipient on the bottom of the telegram, and indicate "One telegram is the same as Telegram No. X to Location Y," without needing to include the complete text. (4) For circular telegrams intended for the recipients to be aware of, the fee-paying service mark "Circular" or "Circular" should be added before each receiving location name.

After several months of implementation, it is reported that the amount of stamp tax in various provinces and cities has gradually increased, especially in Shanghai and Jiangxi, Jiangsu and other provinces, the most significant results.

<p>All the directors and supervisors of the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company had previously submitted written resignations to the Ministry of Communications, which were then submitted to the Executive Yuan, citing financial exhaustion and operational difficulties. After Minister Zhu came to Shanghai twice to persuade them to stay, the attitude of each director and supervisor has softened. They believe that if the Executive Yuan has practical solutions for reorganizing the company's old debts and increasing revenue and reducing expenditure, they may not insist on their intentions and will try their best to endure the difficulties. They also hope that after the Central Plenary Session, a final decision can be made on this matter. Now that the Central Plenary Session has concluded the day before yesterday, the president of the Executive Yuan has been replaced by Chiang Kai-shek, and the ministers of the original ministries have all submitted their resignations. Therefore, the company is also inevitably undergoing reorganization. Therefore, all the directors and supervisors are temporarily remaining silent and waiting for the new Minister of Communications to appoint a fundamental change in the company's organization and plan for the follow-up measures.</p>

<p>Complete Processing Within Ten Days of Document Receipt; Separate Orders Issued to Local Land Guards to Exert Their Utmost Efforts</p>
<p>The Shanghai Lawyers' Association yesterday issued a notice to all members, stating: "Respected sirs, previously, member Xu Zuoliang proposed that in this city, land is sometimes auctioned by court order due to debt. The Standing Committee of the Court often requests the City Land Bureau to estimate the land value as a standard for execution and auction. However, the City Land Bureau's valuation often takes three to five months, or even a year, which is far slower than the valuation speed of the Shanghai Municipal Council (SMC) in the concessions. Furthermore, when inquiring about land map and guarantee numbers from local land guards, the land guards often create difficulties and extort money, causing great suffering to litigants. It is proposed to forward a letter to the City Land Bureau, requesting that in the future, when entrusted with estimating land value, they should order their subordinates to complete the process swiftly within two weeks, and instruct all local land guards to immediately provide the requested land map and guarantee numbers when inquired, to facilitate execution, etc." It was felt that Mr. Xu's proposal was insightful, and a letter was forwarded to the Shanghai City Land Bureau, requesting its adoption. Now, a reply has been received, stating: "The letter of November 19th is acknowledged, 'Regarding cases where the court requests land valuation, please complete the estimation within two weeks, and please instruct all land guards to provide accurate information when inquired about land map and guarantee numbers,' etc. Upon review, matters regarding land valuation requested by the courts in this city are handled according to the procedures stipulated by this bureau. Except for cases involving occupied land that require prior measurement, or where the reported map, embankment, and lot numbers are incorrect, or where the location is unclear, requiring summoning land guards for separate inquiries and boundary demarcation, and cases involving separate disputes over single deeds, which are temporarily difficult to complete within a limited time, all matters will be processed within ten days of document receipt. As for the request to instruct the land guards, it has been complied with. A reply is hereby issued for your information." This has been discussed and resolved at the 213th Joint Meeting of the Executive and Supervisory Committees of this Association, and all members are hereby notified for their information."</p>

<p>The Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Loan Review Committee held its 18th meeting yesterday at the China National Goods Bank. The attending committee members included Cai Zengji, Qin Runqing, Yu Zuoting (substituting for Qin Runqing), Song Ziliang, Wang Xiaolai, Du Yuesheng, Chen Guangfu (substituting for Wang Xiaolai), Bei Songsun, Wang Yansong, etc. Committee members Xi Demao and Zhang Peishen were excused.

After review and discussion, it was decided to approve loans for two companies, reduce the loan amount for twenty-five companies, grant half of the original loan amount to nineteen companies, and reject eleven companies. A total of 34,850 yuan was approved. The committee will notify the applicants of the decisions separately. It is reported that most of those whose loan applications were rejected were because their businesses did not deal in national goods, or because the loan purpose did not comply with the loan regulations. According to the committee's loan principles, loans are limited to factories that manufacture national goods, merchants who sell national goods, and those who transport national goods for export. These industrial and commercial credit loans are still being processed. Those who meet the above principles can obtain application forms at the committee's office on the second floor of the National Goods Bank on Tianjin Road and apply according to the regulations.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Machine-Made National Goods Factories Joint Association sent a letter to various national goods factories in the city yesterday, stating: "Respected sirs, since our country advocated new laws in the late Qing Dynasty, nearly forty years have passed. Europeanization is esteemed, and the atmosphere has greatly changed. The books of Confucius and Mencius have long been regarded as outdated by Chinese people. A group of young people in the industrial and vocational fields are ignorant of them. As a result, morality and propriety have declined, and a sense of shame no longer exists. All thoughts and behaviors have fallen into an abnormal state, leading to misguided paths, and consequently, people complain and blame others. The ancients said, 'Knowing contentment avoids disgrace, knowing when to stop avoids danger.' In recent years, the trend of suicide has become increasingly prevalent. Could this be the reason? Therefore, the government, based on Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings, believes that the words and deeds of the ancient sages and philosophers are related to the rise and fall of the nation. It is vigorously promoting the New Life Movement. Since its implementation, it can be said that 'those above love something, those below will surely enjoy it more.' With this in mind, our member, the Three Friends Industrial Society, has specially invited Sinologist Mr. Qi Fanniu to lecture on the Four Books at the City Radio Broadcasting Station (frequency 1340) from 8:15 PM to 9:15 PM every afternoon, to introduce the profound and timeless principles of our country to the general public. This is to prevent those who admire Europeanization from being too biased and is also a contribution to the government's New Life Movement. We are sending this letter to request that your factory notify all employees to pay attention to listening to the lectures at the designated time. This association also provides eighty seats for listeners, but prior registration is required to avoid congestion."</p>

<h3 id="e137">Rent Reduction United Federation: Actively Carrying Out Rent Reduction Work <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>Since rumors arose in this city, residents in the Zhabei and North Sichuan Road areas have moved away, causing landlords who relied on sub-renting to third-party tenants to supplement their income to suddenly feel an unbearable burden. The matter of tenants in Sida Lane on Shigaota Road requesting a two-month rent reduction from the landlord has already been reported in the newspapers. Following that, tenants at Heng'an Lane, Dade Lane, Xinxiang Lane, and Yongfeng Lane on North Sichuan Road have also made the same request. This is indeed a serious problem amidst the economic downturn. The details of the situation are as follows: (1) Tenants in Dade Lane, Heng'an Lane, Yongfeng Lane, and Xinxiang Lane joined the Shanghai All-Tenants Rent Reduction United Federation and organized the First Branch to carry out rent reduction campaigns due to the unbearable pressure of high rents. Recently, due to rumors arising in this city, three-fifths of the residents in Dade Lane have moved away, only one-fourth of those in Yongfeng Lane remain, and less than half in Xinxiang Lane. Those who have not moved are only small landlords who are guarding empty houses. Once the third-party tenants move away, no one cares about the remaining houses. They are unable to bear the entire rent, and the landlords will not allow them to default. Therefore, all four tenants convened a meeting of all tenants at the Zhongshan Fellow Villagers Association on the 8th of this month, guided by federation representatives Mr. Peng and Mr. Zhu, and unanimously passed a request that the methods of rent reduction and exemption should follow previous lane precedents. The meeting issued a letter to the landlords of the four lanes, urging them to give a satisfactory reply as soon as possible. (2) Tenants Song Weirong, Ye Zufan, Tao Jiafu, Ji Housheng, etc. in Yuqing Lane on Gonghe Road in Zhabei stated that the monthly rent for the houses in the lane before the 20th year of the Republic of China was 15 yuan. After slightly renovating them in January of the 21st year of the Republic of China, the rent was increased significantly. Now, with the market downturn, they are unable to bear the burden. Therefore, they and the rent reduction federation representative Zhuo Wen went to the landlord Xie Fuqing the other day to make a request for a 40% rent reduction. Unexpectedly, the landlord refused their request. Currently, all tenants in the lane have deposited their rent in the bank and have unanimously stopped paying to urge the landlord to come to his senses. (3) All tenants in Kenye Lane on Oujia Road joined the Shanghai All-Tenants Rent Reduction United Federation and organized the Ninth Branch. The inaugural meeting was held the other day, guided by federation representative Zhuo Wen. Zhou Tianping, Tian Yide, and others were elected as executive committee members on the spot. The branch had previously sent a letter to Kenye Bank requesting a rent reduction, but has not yet received a reply. Therefore, on the 8th of this month, another meeting of all tenants was convened, and it was decided that from this month onwards, they would unanimously stop paying rent until a satisfactory reply was received.</p>

<p>Sun Shancheng, the nine-year-old beloved son of Sun Cailing, a native of Fenghua and an employee of the Hankou Agricultural and Industrial Bank, residing at No. 50 Changxing Lane, Beller Road, French Concession, was suddenly kidnapped by kidnappers on the afternoon of August 5th and a huge ransom was demanded. A report was filed with the police, requesting an investigation. On September 12th, Chief Inspector Jin Wujiu of the Special Agency of the French Concession Police and detectives cracked the case and arrested the kidnappers and their accomplices in Shanghai and Hangzhou. Five suspects, including Wang Wenhua, Wang Baoshan, Chen Genlin, Zhang Xiaofu, and a woman named Chen Tang, all natives of Shaoxing, were escorted to the Special No. 2 Court for interrogation. At that time, the investigation of the hostage's whereabouts was unsuccessful. It was not until October 23rd that the kidnappers knew that they could not extort a ransom, and their accomplices had been arrested. They sent the hostage to the China Hotel on Jiujiang Road and notified the victim to report to the police station and send a constable to take the hostage. As a result, the Special No. 2 Court sentenced Wang Wenhua and Wang Baoshan to twelve years of imprisonment each, Chen Genlin and Zhang Xiaofu to seven years of imprisonment each, and Chen Tang to ten years of imprisonment. The details have been reported in this newspaper. Now, the five suspects, Wang and others, are dissatisfied with the judgment and filed an appeal with the Third Branch of the High Court in the hope of reducing their sentences. According to the report, the High Court opened an investigation court yesterday morning at 10:30 AM by Judge Wang Yue to interrogate the arrested thieves. The confessions of the thieves mostly shifted the blame and stated that they were wrongfully arrested. After the judge questioned them repeatedly and in detail, he ordered the thieves to be taken back into custody and set a date for further interrogation after investigation.</p>

<p>Wang Liang, a native of Ningbo, and Tao Ziyuan, a native of Tianjin, took advantage of the fact that Jia Yichuan, Gu Zhaolin, and others, relatives of Li Jinqing, an inspector at the Yangtze Hotel, were arrested and escorted to the Special No. 2 Court for questioning in connection with an opium case in May of this year. They falsely claimed to Li that they could be responsible for making connections with the forensic doctor to identify him as having no opium addiction. They drove him to get 50 yuan. After the matter was exposed, Li filed a complaint with the Criminal Court of the Special No. 2 Court, accusing them of defrauding him of money and requesting an investigation, and attached a civil suit to recover the defrauded money. As a result of the trial, Wang Liang and Tao Ziyuan were each sentenced to six months of imprisonment and jointly and severally ordered to return 50 yuan to the plaintiff.

<h3 id="e151">Lu Shunxing of Lao Bei Men Carelessly Set Fire; Six Men and Women Tragically Buried in Flames; Rumored to Have Started from a Beggar Warming Himself by a Fire Late at Night; Disasters Befell Neighbors with Material Losses of 8,000 Gold <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>Lu Shunxing Mingwa (Skylight Tile) Store at No. 17 Yan Hai Road, Lao Bei Men, suddenly caught fire on the ground floor at 2:30 AM yesterday. The skylight tiles in the store were easily flammable, causing the flames to rise fiercely and become unapproachable. After the police on duty reported to the fire brigade, three fire engines were immediately dispatched from the Southern District and the French Concession to put out the fire. It took half an hour to extinguish the fire, but the entire Lu Shunxing store had been reduced to ashes. The floor of its neighbor, Zhang Fachang Round Wood Store at No. 15, was also destroyed. After investigation, it was found that only the mistress of the Lu Shunxing residence, Mrs. Lu Zhang, a native of Pudong, and two apprentices, Lu Lingeng, 17 years old, local natives, escaped. The rest, including the young master Lu Rongsheng and his wife, their two sons, the mother-in-law, and the old steward, totaling six people, were buried in the flames. After the fire was extinguished, the bodies found at the fire scene were all charred and their faces were blurred and unrecognizable, which was a terrible sight. They were sent to the Xiying Public Office in the Southern City. The local court sent personnel to inspect them at noon. The corpses were to be coffined and buried. The fire was caused by a fire along the street, burning from bottom to top. It is rumored that a vagrant burned paper to warm himself late at night, which spread to the skylight tiles and bamboo tips piled up in front of the door. In particular, the fire broke out at the staircase inside the door. When the fire spread, the staircase broke, and the people sleeping upstairs could not escape, resulting in being burned to death. Lu Shunxing's business was barely enough to make a living. They originally had fire insurance, but it expired in July of this year. In order to save money, the young master Lu Rongsheng cancelled the insurance. His mother-in-law, Zhu Tang, was the sister-in-law of the Zhu family, the owner of the round wood store at No. 11. She had just recovered from an illness in her hometown and was specially invited to Shanghai to recuperate, but she was buried in the fire. Lu's two sons, one was only four years old, named Mao Tou, and the other was only two years old, named Zhixiang. The old steward, Chen Chengqian, was nearly sixty years old and had worked at the store for many years. He also failed to escape this time. Yesterday, the mistress Lu Zhang and apprentice Lu Lingeng were questioned by the Lao Bei Men Police Station and then released. The total material loss of houses and other things is estimated to be around 8,000 gold, which is the most tragic disaster in the Southern District this year. In other news, the six corpses that were burned to death have been transported by car to the Xiying Public Office on Liu Fen Road. Shen Zhenhua, the chief of the Lao Bei Men Police Station in charge, ordered the local security officer to report to the Shanghai Local Court and asked them to send personnel to the scene for inspection before ordering them to coffin them separately. The cause of the fire is currently under strict investigation by the police station.</p>
<h3 id="e152">Fire Alarm on Nanjing Road Yesterday <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>Maochang Glasses Company Catches Fire; Huili Clothing Store Also Affected; Vehicles Stopped, Resembling a Long Snake</p>
<p>A fire broke out at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Yunnan Road yesterday morning, and traffic was also blocked. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Spread of the Fire</p>
<p>The Maochang Glasses Company at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Yunnan Road suddenly caught fire at 8:15 AM yesterday morning, just as it was opening for business. Thick smoke came out from the floor, and there was a lot of noise. The store employees immediately carried water to put out the fire, but the fire became more and more intense, and the flames spread rapidly. The Huili Clothing Store next door and the Yan Dazhi Dental Clinic upstairs were also affected.</p>
<p>Traffic Jam</p>
<p>Upon hearing the news, the Central Fire Brigade immediately dispatched fire engines to the scene. There were as many as five fire engines that gathered. At that time, because it was the time to go to work and school, the traffic was very congested. The Lao Zha Public Concession Police specially dispatched Chinese and foreign detectives to maintain order. At the same time, traffic on Xizang Road, Laohai Road, Yunnan Road, Guizhou Road, and other roads near the Nanjing Road intersection was temporarily blocked. As a result, vehicles traveling to and from the east and west ends of Nanjing Road could not pass, and they connected for a very long time, resembling a long snake. It was not until after 9:00 AM that the fire was extinguished and the situation returned to normal.</p>
<h3 id="e153">Korean Family Robbed on Peng Road, Hongkou <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>Husband and Wife Tied to Chairs; A Large Amount of Japanese and Chinese Currency Robbed</p>
<p>The room at No. 101, No. 6 Lane 297, Peng Road, Hongkou, belonged to Korean resident Nan Xianghu, who was 34 years old and a rice merchant. At around 9:00 AM yesterday morning, two young men, one dressed in Chinese clothes and the other in a Western suit, both about twenty years old, knocked on the door. After the maid opened the door, the two claimed that they wanted to meet Mr. Nan Xianghu, a Korean resident. The maid invited them into the room and went inside to inform the owner. When the owner came out to face them, he realized that he did not know either of them and was about to ask them their intentions. Unexpectedly, the two men showed sharp knives and threatened the husband and wife, tied them with hemp ropes, fastened them to chairs, and stuffed cotton wool in their mouths to prevent them from shouting for help. Then, they went inside and ransacked the boxes and cabinets. As a result, 5,200 Japanese yen and 500 Chinese yuan were robbed. The thieves then left through the front door. Afterwards, the victim filed a report with the Hongkou Police Station, requesting an investigation.</p>
<h3 id="e154">Dismissal of a Manager Named Wang Enrong for Misconduct; Rejected Appeal of a Murder Conviction; Heinous Crime Deserves Death <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>Wang Enrong, a 29-year-old Tianjin native, previously served as a manager at the Great World amusement park. After being dismissed for misconduct in August of this year, Wang harbored resentment towards Wang Dekui, a Yancheng native and the deputy chief inspector of the amusement park. On the evening of September 19th, Wang concealed two sharp, double-edged knives and sneaked into the Great World, stabbing Wang Dekui in vital areas with two blows. Wang Dekui was sent to the hospital but died despite treatment. After the incident, Wang Enrong went to the main entrance of the Great World, where he was apprehended by detectives who recovered the murder weapon and brought him back to the police station. The police department filed a public prosecution for murder. After the trial, Wang Enrong was sentenced to life imprisonment and permanent deprivation of his civil rights. The defendant, dissatisfied with the verdict, appealed to the Higher Third Branch Court. Wang Yue, a judge of the High Court, repeatedly opened investigative hearings and examined the reasons for Wang's appeal, in which he falsely claimed that the victim died because of an incision in his abdomen during the hospital operation, attempting to reduce his guilt. This has been previously reported in this newspaper. The case was then reviewed by the High Court collegial panel, and yesterday at 3:00 PM, acting presiding judge Sun Honglin, accompanied by judges Wang and Qiu, came to the Third Criminal Court and ordered the appellant Wang Enrong to be brought to the case. The appeal was rejected, and the presiding judge explained the reasons for the judgment in summary to the defendant, stating that because he committed misconduct and was dismissed, he harbored resentment towards his superior and stabbed the victim to death, which he had admitted. He could not claim that the death was due to negligence during the hospital operation. An investigation revealed that the victim suffered serious injuries and the hospital provided legal treatment, all of which are documented. The investigation into the defendant's crime revealed that the circumstances were particularly heinous. Sentencing him to death according to the law would not be excessive. The original trial sentenced him to life imprisonment, which was already lenient. His further appeal was deemed to be completely without merit, so the appeal was rejected and the original judgment was upheld. If he was not satisfied, he could submit a statement to this court within ten days after receiving the judgment to appeal to the Supreme Court. The defendant, after being advised, still sought leniency and a reduced sentence. The official advised him that the judgment had been made and that he should not speak further. The defendant then lowered his head and remained silent, and was led away by the bailiffs back to the detention center.</p>

<p>Permanent Incapability of Straightening Up; Ren Xiangyun Returned to Custody, Others Released on Bail</p>
<p>Qu Chunlong, a Taixing native who operates a hat workshop in the Third District of this city, previously served as a guarantor for his friend Zhu Guilin for a loan of sixty yuan, which Zhu had not repaid for many years. In June of this year, the creditor Ren Xiangtang (i.e., Ren the Monk) entrusted lawyer Zhang Deyou and Zhang's assistant Gao Minglu to send letters demanding repayment, but to no avail. Zhang Deyou even went personally to demand repayment. The next day, four thugs armed with guns broke into Qu Chunlong's home and threatened him. Qu hid upstairs, but his apprentice Sheng Shaoshan grabbed the intruders, causing him to be shot in the left waist. Afterwards, Qu Chunlong filed a complaint with the District Court Prosecutor's Office. Prosecutor Zhang Zi investigated and prosecuted the defendants Zhang Deyou, Gao Minglu, and Ren Xiangyun, etc., in the Criminal Court for crimes under Article 29, Paragraph 1 and Article 305 of the Criminal Code. Judge Wu Xiangzu repeatedly held open trials, but the case remained unresolved. Details have been previously reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, Judge Wu held another hearing with the injured apprentice Sheng Shaoshan, who was carried to the court (because the gunshot wound had not healed and he was still hospitalized). According to his testimony, even after his injuries healed, he would be permanently disabled, his spine would be permanently curved, and he would be unable to straighten up. Next, Qu Chunlong and the defendants Zhang Deyou, Gao Minglu, and Ren Xiangyun testified once each. The judge then ordered the commencement of arguments. Lawyer Sun Bawu and others for the defendants rose to defend them for a long time, after which the arguments were concluded. The verdict was scheduled to be announced at 2:00 PM on the 17th of this month. Ren Xiangyun was returned to custody, while Zhang Deyou and Gao Mingyuan remained released on their original bail.</p>

<h3 id="e157">Chinese Detective Jin Wanrong Awarded for Distinguished Service <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>Jin Wanrong, Chinese Detective No. 60 of the Public Concession Police Department, has been awarded the First Class Medal for Distinguished Service and his meritorious service recorded by the Concession Police Department’s Honours Committee, after being proposed by the Municipal Council Board for extraordinary loyalty and bravery and meritorious service in capturing thieves. It is reported that at approximately 7:00 PM on the evening of July 2nd of this year, the Yulin Road Police Station received a report that four robbers were dining at No. 156 Pingliang Road and dispatched Chinese and Western detectives to surround and arrest them. Upon reaching the location, they rushed in through the back door. Jin Wanrong, holding a gun, bravely led the way up the stairs. At that time, the four robbers were dining and immediately opened fire to resist arrest upon seeing the detectives. Jin was hit first and fell to the ground with a wound to his right waist. Behind Jin, Western Detective Granville and Chinese Detective No. 98 fired inwards at the doorway. Bullets flew everywhere, and two robbers fell in response. When Granville and No. 98 ran out of bullets, they went downstairs to reload. One robber then fled to the sun deck to escape, but was spotted by Chinese Detective No. 104, who had arrived and saw the fleeing robber from the adjacent room’s sun deck and shot him down. At this time, only Jin Wanrong was fighting two robbers in the room. Jin was already injured, but still thought of making the arrest, which caused him to be shot in the right leg. When Jin ran out of bullets and had no time to reload, he thought of seizing the gun from the injured robber. The injured robber fired another shot at Jin, fortunately missing. Jin then used his strength to subdue him and seize his weapon. At that moment, another robber fired a shot that penetrated Jin's body. Jin had already been shot three times. At this time, the robber who had fired two shots was still uninjured and immediately jumped onto the balcony to escape, but was spotted by detectives outside the door, who immediately shot him down. Jin, having seized the enemy's weapon in the room, immediately found a way to shoot down one robber and seized the weapon of the other robber. Thus, all four robbers were captured. Jin saw that the matter was over and crawled up, thinking of going downstairs alone, but collapsed at the doorway, unable to support himself due to his serious injuries. He was then supported down by other detectives and taken to the hospital for treatment. The police department later praised Jin for his meticulousness in the face of danger, commendable loyalty and bravery, and his ability to subdue three robbers after suffering serious injuries. They unanimously expressed admiration and awarded him the First Class Medal for Distinguished Service.</p>
<h3 id="e158">Notorious Female Gangster Gu Jindi Arrested <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>Exposed for Selling Red Pills; Sentenced to Two Years in Prison After Trial</p>
<p>There are two well-known female gangsters in this city: one is Lu Laoqi, and the other is Gu Jindi, the sister of the former Flower Association King Zheng Meitang. Both have extraordinary influence, with many followers. Recently, Lu was arrested by the French Concession Police for suspicion of involvement in an assassination case and sent to the Second Special District Court for interrogation and detention. Gu was also arrested by the Hongkou Police for trafficking red pills. Thus, these two notorious female leaders of Shanghai have both been caught in the legal net. The details of Gu's arrest are as follows:</p>
<p>Gu Jindi, a Ningbo native, 30 years old. After her brother Zheng Meitang was killed, she married a gangster named Gu and lived with him at No. 21, Lane 122, Yuanfang Road. She took her husband's surname. Last year, Gu was sentenced to ten years in prison by the First Special District Court for murder. He then appealed to the Second Branch of the High Court and was acquitted due to insufficient evidence. Gu Jindi, on the other hand, has special influence in the Hongkou area and secretly runs a red pill business, using women to transport them to avoid the eyes of detectives. Therefore, since its inception, it has never been exposed. Every morning, Gu orders her partner, a Yong woman named Mao Aibao, to deliver two bags of red pills to the Bund outside Second Malu, each bag worth six yuan and forty cents. Mao receives four cents for transportation, and the rest is handed over to Gu. Recently, at 6:45 AM, Mao was delivering red pills to the Bund outside Second Malu when she was stopped by Hongkou Police Detective Wu Deyu, Detective Bao Ni Jialai, and Chinese Constable No. 325 while passing Broadway Road and Wuchang Road. Suspecting her, they searched her and found two bags of red pills, which they took back to the police station. After Mao confessed, they went to No. 21, Lane 122, Yuanfang Road, and arrested Gu, finding four bags of red pills under the sofa. She was sent to the First Special Court and prosecuted under Article 263 of the Criminal Code. Yesterday morning, Judge Ye Shengchao opened the Fifth Criminal Court for interrogation. Police Lawyer Jiang Baolian explained the case and, after examining the case, stated that it was in fact in line with Article 257, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Code and requested that the charging articles be corrected. Then, the detectives testified about the search, and when Gu Jindi was questioned, she denied it outright, claiming she had been framed, and hired a lawyer to defend her, saying that Gu Jindi's husband had also been falsely imprisoned and then released and that the detectives who handled the case were reprimanded by the chief patrol officer, resulting in a grudge against him, and thus the occurrence of this case. After Judge Ye verified the confession, he announced the judgment in court: Gu Jindi was sentenced to two years in prison for continuously selling morphine compounds, and Mao Aibao was sentenced to one year and six months in prison for aiding in the sale of morphine compounds. The six bags of red pills were confiscated.</p>
<h3 id="e159">Bales Company Sues Comprador for Embezzlement <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>Defendant Claims Accounting Dispute; Court Orders Rescheduling for Further Inquiry</p>
<p>Yin Fugen, a Ningbo native and comprador for the British company Bales Limited, embezzled the company's funds and fled back to his hometown. After the employer reported it to the police, Yin returned to Shanghai and surrendered himself. He was sent to the First Special District Court for investigation and interrogation, as previously reported. The police investigation found that Yin had fraudulently obtained 7,989 yuan from Bales from July 15th to November 15th. In addition, because he also continued to embezzle funds from the British company White Law Company, he is now being prosecuted under Article 339 of the Criminal Code in a consolidated case. Yesterday morning, Judge Jiang of the First Special Court interrogated him. Police Lawyer Zhang Shizhu stated the defendant's embezzlement process, saying that he signed a contract with Bales in the 21st year of the Republic to serve as a comprador, stipulating that his commission for transactions was 1%. In June of this year, the contract was revised and the commission was also changed to 3%. The defendant's method of defrauding money was to forge household names such as Chaoji, Fuji, and Xingji, etc. When questioned, the shareholders stated that after the contract was revised, the commission he received was still 1%, so the matter was purely an accounting dispute. The court then ordered rescheduling for further inquiry.</p>
<h3 id="e160">Chen Bohe Illegally Opens Hospital to Collect Money Without Registration <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>Using the Pretext of Guaranteed Treatment for Lung Disease, Xu Wenfeng is Deceived</p>
<p>Chen Bohe, a native of Taizhou, Jiangbei, 29 years old, used to be an assistant officer in the military medical office of the newly compiled 10th Division of the Army, so he gained some experience in medicine. After being discharged, he returned to Shanghai and masqueraded as a doctor, practicing medicine. He first opened the Dehe Hospital on North Shanxi Road, and then moved to Changping Road, renaming it Changping Hospital. Chen served as the president and doctor of the hospital, but because Chen's medical skills were not good, business was poor and the place was deserted. After opening for several months, he accumulated a huge amount of rent. Chen was unable to maintain it and had no choice but to flee. The landlord filed a lawsuit in the Civil Court of the First Special Court. After several hearings, Dong was found absent and a default judgment was made, ordering Chen Bohe to repay 200 yuan plus statutory interest. However, Chen was not afraid of the law and secretly continued to defraud money as a slick doctor. On one hand, he opened the Nanyang Hospital at No. 1209 Roberts Road, indiscriminately issuing flyers and arbitrarily exaggerating, saying that he could cure all diseases and would not refuse poor patients. Xu Wenfeng, a native of Suqian who lived on Roberts Road, was deceived by the flyer. His five-year-old son Xu Wentong was suffering from a severe illness, so in October he took his son to Nanyang Hospital for treatment. Initially, he paid a consultation fee of two corners once or twice. Later, Chen Bohe suddenly told Xu Wenfeng that his son was suffering from tuberculosis and could not be cured in a short time. He suggested that Chen provide guaranteed treatment in order to be effective. Xu agreed and discussed the price of guaranteed treatment. Chen initially asked for one hundred yuan, then settled on sixty yuan, stating that half of the amount, thirty yuan, must be paid first, and the remainder paid later. Xu paid thirty yuan, and Chen issued a receipt and a guaranteed treatment voucher. After several treatments, not only did the illness not improve, but he was also charged ten yuan. Recently, Xu refused to pay the remaining twenty yuan because his son's illness had not improved. Chen also refused to treat the illness as an excuse. Xu then became suspicious and discussed it with Wu Xingen, the president of the Fourth District Branch of the Shanghai Citizens' United Association. Wu sent a letter to the Social Affairs Bureau and the Health Department of the Public Works Department to investigate. According to the reply, Chen Bohe was not registered and was not a doctor. Xu then realized he had been deceived and reported the situation to the Putuo Road Police Station, which dispatched detectives to arrest Chen Bohe, seizing the seals of Dehe Hospital, Changping Hospital, and Chen Bohe, and taking them to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Police Lawyer Zhang Tianyin, in addition to prosecuting under Article 340 of the Criminal Code, also stated the case, followed by Xu Wenfeng's complaint about the defendant's treatment of his son's illness and the payment of consultation fees. The defendant's testimony was evasive. Judge Liu Yugui verified the confession and ordered Chen to be returned to custody, with a rescheduled hearing in seven days. He also ordered the police to send the medicine to the Health Department of the Public Works Department for testing.</p>
<h3 id="e161">French Concession Bailu Road; A Morphine Manufacturing Operation is Cracked; The Main Culprit Has Fled, The Woman Who Recently Gave Birth Granted Bail; The Police Request an Extension to Arrest the Main Culprit <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>French Police Superintendent Piquesky (transliteration) and Chinese Detective Gao Hongxuan learned on the morning of the 8th that someone was secretly manufacturing morphine in a private operation inside No. 8 Baoanfang, Bailu Road, Nanyang Bridge, and selling it in the city, violating the government's strict prohibition of drugs. Therefore, at noon that day, they led detectives He Zongyu, Chen Tinghuai, Zheng Jikun, Wang Wenwei, Li Hezhang, etc., to secretly search the address. Upon arriving at the number and knocking on the door, the main culprit, a Cantonese man surnamed Lin, had already heard the sound and jumped over the sun deck to escape. Only the suspected Cantonese Wu Chenghe (49 years old) and Wu Zhangshi (37 years old, who had just given birth and was resting in bed) and two other men and women were apprehended. Inside the second floor and the mezzanine, they seized a motor manufacturing machine, two green jars, a wind furnace, a lead bucket sieve, and large glass bottles for storing strong acid, etc., several pounds of manufactured morphine, and raw material drugs, etc. (The packaging paper boxes of each raw material were mostly labeled with the signs of a certain pharmacy), and took them to the police station together. According to Wu and others, the second landlord, Zheng Guozhang from Chaozhou, lives at No. 83 Dongxinqiao Street. The detectives went to the address to arrest him, but Zheng had already fled after hearing the news. Only his wife Zheng Wushi (33 years old, Chaozhou native) was arrested. Yesterday afternoon, they were sent to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special Court. Police Lawyer Yuan Jiadan stated the case and requested an extension to further detain the fugitive main culprit and thoroughly investigate the case before filing a lawsuit for interrogation. When Wu Chenghe was questioned, he said, "I am a co-tenant. The second floor was rented by a man surnamed Lin, who moved in on the evening of November 21st and said he was doing a liquid medicine business. I didn't know he was manufacturing morphine." Wu Zhangshi said, "I didn't know Lin was making morphine. I gave birth last month on the 22nd and haven't completed my confinement. My child died six days after birth. I am resting in bed." Zheng Wushi said, "My husband sells roasted meat. The Baoanfang house was rented on May 1st of this year. I didn't know he was making morphine." Because Wushi was unfamiliar with the Shanghai dialect, her testimony was translated by the defendants. Presiding Judge Wang Gangxu verified the confession and ordered rescheduling for further inquiry on the 14th. Wu Zhangshi was granted bail of 300 yuan to be available for summons at any time. Wu Chenghe and Zheng Wushi were returned to custody. The morphine equipment and raw materials seized were temporarily stored in the stolen goods warehouse.</p>

<p>Those with 150 yuan or less will be fully refunded, while those with more will receive 25%; According to the Daily News. The American Trust Company Bank on Xiafei Road in this port, after being affected by the closure of its Harbin headquarters, entrusted lawyer Huang Peizhu to sort out the accounts and raise cash in preparation for refunding depositors' savings. According to the bank's liquidation department, the reporter of the Daily News said that the procedures for repaying a portion of depositors have been completed. However, because raising a large sum of money takes a little time, it has been decided to implement a refund method in batches. Starting from the 9th of this month, depositors with 150 yuan or less will be fully refunded, while those with more than 150 yuan will first receive 25%. Once all the cash has been raised, it can be fully refunded without any problems. Each depositor has been notified to go and claim it.</p>
<h3 id="e163">Citywide Inspection of Public Places Completed; Those Not Yet in Order Given a Deadline to Correct; Hair Salons Found to be Best in Inspection Results <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>According to the Xin Sheng News Agency, the city's Public Security Bureau conducted an inspection of public places, which lasted for five months. The deadline was repeatedly extended to avoid any omissions or negligence. Now, as a result of the inspection, all places have gradually followed the orders, paying attention to tidiness and cleanliness. Therefore, the New Movement Section of the bureau sent personnel for a final inspection from the 2nd to the 7th of this month, which has now concluded.</p>
<p>Deadline for Correction</p>
<p>After the bureau's final inspection, places that still need to be urgently corrected have been given a specific deadline to correct them. The deadlines are four types: ten days, seven days, five days, and three days. After the deadline has passed, the police from each branch bureau will be responsible for checking and verifying whether the changes have been made, and paying attention to the progress of the items listed in the "Progress Table." If a cross is marked, it means that the improvement has been made. An "x" means that it has not been implemented. If repeated persuasion has been given in the past but no changes have been made, the bureau will impose penalties. After the final inspection deadline, the bureau plans to conduct random spot checks at any time to avoid superficial compliance.</p>
<p>Inspection Results</p>
<p>The results of the bureau's final inspection of public places throughout the city show that the best results in terms of tidiness, cleanliness, and implementation of the New Movement are: first, hair salons; second, restaurants; third, bathhouses; fourth, hotels; and fifth, entertainment venues. The tidiness and cleanliness of hair salons are indeed superior to other public places, so the inspection results are most satisfactory for this type of business.</p>

<h3 id="e165">Provincial Supervisory Office Sends Personnel to Investigate Former Luodian Public Security Bureau Chief Case <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>On April 26th of this year, in Zhao Jia Lane, about two li east of Luodian Town, there were two men wearing blue cloth short shirts and trousers at the home of an old woman surnamed Jin (who usually looked at incense heads, commonly called spirit medium). They falsely claimed to invite the old woman to a certain place to conduct a séance. At that time, the old woman's son, named Jin Zhixiang, returned home from doing business in Shanghai and knew that these two men must be scammers, so he refused their request. Unexpectedly, the two men wearing blue cloth shirts and trousers took out guns and threatened him. Jin suspected they were robbers, so he shouted loudly, and farmers from the surrounding villages arrived and tied one of them up and sent him to the Luodian District Office. Later, Zhou Jintang, the chief of the town's Public Security Branch, heard about it and arrived. Seeing that the two men tied up were plainclothes policemen from the bureau, he immediately retrieved them and apologized to the crowd to end the matter. Unexpectedly, on September 15th, Zhou again accused Jin of using sorcery to treat illnesses, violating police regulations. Therefore, he sent police to arrest Jin and fine him 30 yuan. Unexpectedly, Jin's son Zhixiang refused to accept this and filed a lawsuit with the High Court and also filed a complaint with the Jiangsu Provincial Supervisory Office of the Supervisory Yuan and the Civil Affairs Department. Now it is learned that the Supervisory Office has specially sent personnel to Luodian to investigate in order to understand the truth of the matter. Many witnesses to the case have been summoned.</p>

<h3 id="e167">Deadline for General Registration of Patent Medicines Approaches; New Medicine Association Petitions for Two-Year Extension <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>The National United Association of New Medicine Industries yesterday submitted a petition to the Ministry of Health, stating that the deadline for the general registration of patent medicines should be extended by two years to allow sufficient time for procedures. It is reported that the deadline for the general registration of patent medicines will expire at the end of December of this year. However, considering that there are many types of patent medicines and very few have obtained permits, due to the complicated procedures of revising prescriptions and amending leaflets, it is difficult to complete them in time. There are many more who have not yet submitted their registration. The period from now until the deadline for general registration is very pressing, and it is certainly impossible for industries in various places to complete the registration procedures in time. Therefore, it has been resolved by the first session of the association's representative assembly to submit a petition to the Ministry of Health, requesting that the deadline for general registration be extended by two years. On the one hand, the association will do its utmost to urge industries in various places to handle the registration of patent medicine products in accordance with laws and regulations during the extension period in order to live up to the Ministry's intention to protect the new medicine industry. Please grant approval to facilitate handling and allow sufficient time for procedures.</p>

<h3 id="e172">General Overview of the Shanghai Soap Industry <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>(Fifth of the General Overview of Shanghai Industry and Commerce) Edited by China Credit Information Service</p>
<p>1.  Development of the Shanghai Soap Manufacturing Industry</p>
<p>Alkaline substances can remove dirt and grime. Our ancestors and rural women in remote areas today often use rice straw ashes or soapberry pods to wash things because they contain alkaline properties. After the opening of trade ports, Chinese people began to use foreign soap. Foreign soap is manufactured using scientific methods, and in addition to containing better alkaline substances, it also contains some animal or vegetable oils, so it has greater cleaning power and does not damage clothing as easily as grass ash or soapberry pods. As a result, foreign soap entered our country unimpeded.</p>
<p>The first foreign soap imported into our country was "Lihe" soap. In recent years, the "Xiangmao" and "Beiji" brands of foreign goods have also been selling well in the market. During this time, British and Japanese capital successively came to Shanghai to set up factories for manufacturing, directly selling their products to Shanghai and inland areas, monopolizing the soap market in our country. The "Shanghai Oil and Fat Co., Ltd." (Japanese-owned), established two years before the founding of the Republic of China (1910), and the "China Soap Co., Ltd." (British-owned), established one year before the founding of the Republic of China, were the two major forces that rose at that time. To this day, they are still the dominant players in the Shanghai soap industry.</p>
<p>Although soap manufacturing is a type of chemical industry, it does not involve the production of chemical raw materials but merely the reconfiguration of already-made chemical semi-finished products. The technology is not complicated, and the required capital can be large or small. Therefore, soon after the import of foreign soap, when British and Japanese capital were establishing a foundation in China, Chinese merchants who rose up to imitate them were also quite numerous. For example, Chinese merchant Dong Fuqing established the "Yumao Soap Factory" in Zhabei, Shanghai, which was the pioneer of soap factories in our country. Those that followed included "Yimao" in the first year of the Republic, and "Nanyang," "Lida," and "Dingfeng" in the second year of the Republic. The newly established Chinese soap factories in Shanghai are listed by year as follows:</p>
<p>Year  Number of Factories</p>
<p>Years 1-5 of the Republic  6</p>
<p>Years 11-15 of the Republic 7</p>
<p>Years 21-24 of the Republic 3</p>
<p>First half of the year</p>
<p>Year  Number of Factories</p>
<p>Years 6-10 of the Republic 3</p>
<p>Years 16-20 of the Republic 4</p>
<p>The above table is calculated based on existing factories that have joined the trade association. Factories that have closed down or have not joined the association are not included. Therefore, the actual number of factories should be slightly more than what is listed in the above table. Even if we only consider the existing factories that have not joined the association, there are about ten. Overall, there are quite a few Chinese soap factories in Shanghai, but because of their small capital and mostly manual manufacturing techniques, it is still very difficult to compete with foreign companies. In recent years, the Shanghai soap industry has also been in a recession. During the January 28th Incident, a total of six factories were directly destroyed or indirectly affected and closed down. Although the devastation of the military conflict has passed, the misfortune of economic panic has not been eliminated. Contraction is often heard of. How to unite and strive for survival to overcome the current difficulties is what the soap industry should work together to achieve.</p>
<p>2.  General Overview of Various Soap Factories in Shanghai (Chinese and Foreign)</p>
<p>According to a recent survey by our institute, there are currently more than 30 Shanghai Chinese soap manufacturing factories. Among them, 24 have joined the trade association (the trade association was established in the winter of the 17th year of the Republic). The factory names, capital, and production volume are listed on the left for reference:</p>

<p>Zhenji Soap Factory Year 13 of the Republic 1,000 yuan 2,000 ——</p>
<p>Xinhua Soap Factory Year 14 of the Republic 4,000 yuan 12,000 Moonlight, Electric Light, Double Boat</p>

<p>Guangtong Soap Company Year 19 of the Republic 40,000 yuan —— Linked Rings</p>
<p>Invincible Perfume Soap Factory Year 24 of the Republic 50,000 yuan —— Butterfly</p>
<p>According to the above table, the largest Chinese factory in terms of capital is Wuzhou Guben Soap Medicine Factory, with 300,000 yuan. The next largest are Nanyang, Wudi, Guangtong, and Central, with between 40,000 and 60,000 yuan. The rest are small factories with 10,000 yuan or several thousand yuan. However, even for Wuzhou, compared to the foreign factories in Shanghai, the capital of just the British-owned China Soap Company (8 million yuan) exceeds the total capital of the 25 Chinese factories listed above. No wonder the national industry cannot stand alone and compete with foreign companies. There are not many foreign factories in Shanghai, but their capital is very strong. The main ones are as follows:</p>
<p>1.  China Soap Co., Ltd. The establishment date and capital have been mentioned earlier. The factory is located at 2310 Yangshupu Road, covering an area of over 100 mu. Its head office is located on the second floor of the Mackenzie Building on the Bund. Branch offices are established in major ports such as Tianjin, Nanchang, Xiamen, and Shenyang. The company was formed by the merger of Lever Brothers, Wesson, Price's, and 厚丰 four soap companies. It is extremely large in scale. Its products are divided into household soap and cosmetic soap (mainly the former). There are many brands, such as Lux soap, Lever antiseptic soap, Xiangmao, Beiji, Sunlight, etc. The daily output of household soap alone reaches six to seven thousand cases, and the average annual turnover can reach 10 million yuan.</p>
<p>2.  Shanghai Oil and Fat Co., Ltd. The factory was established one year earlier than the China Soap Factory. It was built on Bimin Road, and the sales office was located on Henan Road (the Linbao foreign firm is also its sales agency). The registered capital is 500,000 yuan, and the paid-up capital is 250,000 yuan. It has 35 machines and employs about 120 workers. The annual output is 1 million dozen of perfume soap and 900,000 jin of oil and fat.</p>
<p>3.  The First Company (also known as the First Industrial Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.) is a branch from the Japanese head office. It was established in the 7th year of the Republic. The factory is located at 55 Hejian Road, covering an area of about 4 mu. Since last year, the capital has been expanded to 1 million Japanese yen, with a paid-up capital of 625,000 yuan and accumulated reserves of about 20 Japanese yen. The factory mainly manufactures and sells industrial soap. The annual output is 8,640 cases of soap, and the annual turnover reaches 200,000 Japanese yen. The sales office is located at 355 Miller Road.</p>
<p>4.  Raw Materials for Manufacturing Soap</p>
<p>The main raw materials for manufacturing soap are alkali and oil. Perfume soap also requires various fragrances, but they account for a very small proportion. There are many types of alkali, which can be mainly divided into three types: soda ash, caustic soda, and sodium metasilicate. Very little is produced domestically, and most is imported. The import volume of soda ash and caustic soda in the last four years is statistically shown as follows (unit: Customs Gold Unit):</p>
<p>Year 21 Year 22 Year 23 January-October Year 24</p>
<p>Soda Ash 1,691,581 1,135,867 1,115,024 872,036</p>
<p>Caustic Soda 1,026,733 1,045,476 1,043,236 1,096,139</p>
<p>Year 21 National Shanghai</p>
<p>Household and Laundry Soap 147 44</p>
<p>Cosmetic Soap 578 282</p>
<p>Note: Unit: 1,000 Customs Gold Units.</p>
<p>The import amounts of both are trending downward. The main reason should be the decline in the domestic market and the decrease in people's purchasing power. However, household soap decreased by two-thirds in three years, while cosmetic soap decreased by only one-fifth. This indicates the increasing development of Chinese factories that manufacture household soap. In addition, the result of the competition between Wuzhou Guben Soap and Xiangmao Soap of the British-owned China Soap Company is also quite consistent with this theory. According to statistics, Wuzhou Guben Soap Factory was indeed established in the 10th year of the Republic, but its development has only been in recent years. In the 18th year of the Republic, the annual turnover was only over 2 million yuan, and the annual profit increased from 20,000 yuan to 300,000 yuan in the 23rd year of the Republic. The main key is that the sales of Xiangmao in Shanghai have been taken over by Guben. Although Xiangmao repeatedly lowered prices for dumping, it still failed to reverse the trend. Therefore, everything depends on our efforts. According to the first and ninth issues of the Federation of Labor Unions, the crude soap produced by Chinese factories in Shanghai has less moisture and more pure soap content than those produced by foreign companies. This kind of substantial improvement is the foundation for the success of the national soap industry in our country. The chemical test results are extracted below to inform the people of the country:</p>
<p>Comparison of Chemical Composition of Chinese and Foreign Fine Soap</p>
<p>Item Xiangmao Soap Guben Soap Nanyang Soap Pacific Soap Fan Brand Soap</p>
<p>Moisture 48.03% 33.00% 30.50% 40.60% 29.37%</p>
<p>Rosin 8.18% 8.99% 12.17% 7.80% 6.44%</p>
<p>Total Fatty Acids 40.67% 55.19% 49.71% 40.44% 47.12%</p>
<p>Total Alkali Content 6.85% 9.17% 8.96% 8.37% 7.37%</p>
<p>Pure Soap 47.52% 64.36% 58.667% 48.81% 60.59%</p>
<p>Salt 0.35% 1.40% 0.40% 0.54% 0.45% 0.17%</p>
<p>Water Glass 4.10% 1.24% 3.22% 5.18% 5.40%</p>
<p>Free Oil 0.62% 0.39% 3.40% 0.18%</p>
<p>Free Alkali 0.03% 0.01% 0.08% 0.16% 0.54%</p>
<p>Glycerin 4.05% 1.95% 5.86% 4.67% 4.00%</p>
<p>Non-Soap Matter 9.76% 3.99% 1.10% 11.64% 10.11%</p>
<p>However, at present, the capital of each Chinese factory is limited, and the output is not high. In addition to selling in Shanghai, the soap produced cannot be widely sold in other ports in the interior. Therefore, foreign factories still control the power of frost in North China, South China, and the upper reaches of the Yangtze River. It is hoped that all factories will work together to improve products, expand production, so that the people of the whole country can use soap made by Chinese people, which will make a great contribution to the revival of the national economy.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Education recently issued two official documents regarding the interpretation of educational laws and regulations, which are compiled below:</p>
<p>(1) The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education submitted a request for interpretation of various ambiguities in the revised regulations for private schools concerning the board of directors. The Ministry issued an instruction to the department, stating that the submitted request for interpretation of various ambiguities in the revised regulations for private schools concerning the board of directors has been reviewed item by item as follows: (1) When the number of founders is excessive, one to three persons may be mutually elected as ex officio members of the board of directors; the remaining founders are not within the board of directors. (2) If an ex officio member resigns for some reason, the method of re-election should be handled in accordance with the articles of association of the board of directors. (3) The organization and powers of the board of directors, as well as the term of office and re-election methods of the directors, shall be stipulated in the articles of association of the board of directors in accordance with Article 13 of the revised regulations for private schools, and shall be submitted to the competent educational administrative authority for approval when the board of directors applies for registration. (4) If an ex officio member of the board of directors has illegal conduct, it shall be reported to the competent educational administrative authority for approval. (5) Once the board of directors has been organized and established, the number of directors and the method of re-election shall be handled in accordance with the articles of association of the board of directors. Founders who are not directors shall not interfere, etc. (2) The Qingdao Municipal Bureau of Education requested an interpretation regarding various ambiguities in the examination of teachers in middle schools and normal schools. The Ministry of Education approved the following instructions: (1) Graduates of university undergraduate or specialized courses and specialized schools, the subjects for which they request examination should, in principle, be those they have specialized in.

<h3 id="e183">The Problem of Improving Chinese Musical Instruments (1) <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>— Ding Xiexiu</p>
<p>Three or four years ago, Mr. Xiao Youmei, the president of the National Conservatory of Music, raised a question to me during a conversation. He said that flutes in Western musical instruments are very expensive, and it is not easy for students to purchase them. Could the old-fashioned Chinese flute be improved so that it can replace the Western flute, and at the same time, the price can be very low? In other words, can the Chinese flute be turned into a "proletarian" Western flute? I immediately felt a great interest in this question, and at the same time, this question raised two broader questions: (1) Is it necessary and possible to improve Chinese musical instruments? (2) If we believe that Chinese musical instruments should be improved, should the direction of improvement not only pay attention to academic and artistic aspects, but also take into account popularization?</p>
<p>We see very few opinions from Chinese music experts on Chinese musical instruments. From private conversations, there seem to be two extreme views. One is that Chinese musical instruments are too simple and too narrow. Western musical instruments have many types and good quality. Music, of course, has its national character, but musical instruments can be used in common. With Western musical instruments, we can still produce Chinese music. Since others have ready-made and perfect tools, why don't we completely accept them? Furthermore, the evolution of Western music is progressing towards ideal instruments. If Chinese musical instruments are improved, they will only gradually become Western musical instruments. Furthermore, the reason why Chinese musical instruments are Chinese musical instruments may be because of their simplicity. The reason why the erhu is the erhu is because there is too much noise. The reason why the guqin is the guqin is because its sound is just low enough to be inaudible" (this is English writer Russell's description of the Chinese guqin). The other view is that Chinese music was originally very developed. Like all other civilizations, the twelve-tone equal temperament scale structure currently used in the West was invented by the Chinese. Harmony has always existed in Chinese music. Musical instruments were also very developed originally, but they have only been lost now. As long as we are willing to put effort into the waste paper pile, the revival of Chinese music is not difficult to achieve. Furthermore, among the Chinese musical instruments we currently have, there are also many excellent products. The sheng, xiao, dizi, pipa, and guqin each have their own characteristics. If we hold the prejudice of Western musical instruments and make arbitrary changes, for example, increasing the volume of the xiao and guqin, then all the subtle and wonderful points of these two instruments will be lost. We dare not say that the above two extreme views can include all the opinions of Chinese music experts on Chinese musical instruments, but at least they can represent the opinions of two groups of people without any problem. Naturally, the first view mostly belongs to people who study Western music, and the second view mostly belongs to people who study Chinese music.</p>
<p>From the perspective of us laymen, the above two views seem to contain some very obvious truths, but at the same time, they are not without questionable points. Let's first talk about the first view. First, musical instruments are indeed a kind of tool, but at the same time, each has its own individual timbre, just as food is a material for nourishing life, but different people have different tastes, and writing is a tool for expressing thoughts, but different writing has different forms and structures. Although in terms of writing, some people advocate abolishing Chinese characters and using Roman letters, and some people even advocate abolishing all existing writing and using Esperanto, in terms of food, it seems that some people believe that cooking should be abolished and chemical pills should be used instead, but this is entirely from a utilitarian point of view. Whether it can be done, whether it should be done, of course, are all still problems. If we think from the aspect of enjoyment, it seems that people who appreciate literature and art, it is best to be proficient in all kinds of writing, and people who love delicious food, it is best to have both Western and Chinese food, and Longjing coffee, which is more suitable. However, this is still an equal treatment of all kinds of things. In fact, a nation naturally has a special feeling for its inherent writing, taste, and music. People who have lived abroad for many years have probably had an experience similar to the following. People who have lived abroad for many years, whenever they open a hometown association or alumni association to play music programs, are mostly respectfully listening to foreign music. As soon as they hear Chinese tunes, they will involuntarily be beaming with joy. Of course, there are factors of not knowing foreign music and homesickness, but it cannot be said that it is not a natural response of Chinese people to their own national tunes.</p>

<p>But the moon's round face had not yet peered over the mountain top to break her hope, and she had already fallen asleep, leaning against the small thatched pavilion formed by tall ferns, deeply immersed in a sweet dream, in which she saw many fireflies, blue skirts, pits and valleys of berries, and Robb was wiping away the tears of a black cow, which was crying and complaining, "I want to go home! I want to go home!"</p>
<p>〇〇〇〇〇〇〇〇〇〇〇〇</p>
<p>The children had fallen asleep, and the buzzing of the nearby mosquitoes helped them to fall into a deep sleep, but their family at home was very alarmed. The hay wagon arrived at five o'clock, and the rest of the people had arrived at the fence on time to wait, but Jack, Amy, Nan, and Rob were not seen. This time, it was not Rice, but Frank who was driving the wagon. When the children told him that others had returned home from the forest, he looked displeased and said, "They have to leave Robb and let him take the wagon back. He will be very tired from walking a long way."</p>
<p>"That road is shorter, and they will be carrying him," said Tafie, who was eager to eat his dinner.</p>
<p>"Are you sure that Nan and Robb went with them?"</p>
<p>"Of course; I saw them climb over that pile of walls, singing that it was already five o'clock, and Jack was shouting that they were going home on another road," Tommo explained again.</p>
<p>"Then that's best, let's all go together," so the firewood wagon, carrying the tired children and many full buckets, rattled back.</p>

<p>A Fierce Battle is Inevitable When Two Strong Teams Meet</p>
<p>—John Won Against Two Stars Last Night—</p>
<p>There are two Group A games in tonight's West Youth Basketball League. The competition between Mullins and Pirates at 7:45 PM will be worth watching. The two teams have been rivals for many years and are the two main protagonists in the fight for the championship. However, Mullins' strength is slightly weaker this season and they once lost to Xie Xing. Tonight, they will meet Pirates on a narrow road. Judging from the situation, it seems difficult for them to achieve anything. The schedule for tonight is listed below:</p>
<p>Tonight's Schedule</p>
<p>Jewish vs. Sokol (Group B) 7:00 PM</p>
<p>Pirates vs. Mullins (Group A) 7:45 PM</p>

<p>In yesterday's game, John battled Nanxing in Group A. There was fierce competition. The score fluctuated back and forth, and the difference was often within a few points. The first half ended with 29 to 22, and the final score was 51 to 41. John won the final victory. In the Group B game, Shui Zhuan defeated Moore, and the situation was also average. The result was 36 to 26. The game between John High School and Guoguang was rescheduled.</p>
<p>Shui Zhuan Wins Against Moore (Group B)</p>
<p>In the first Group B game, Shui Zhuan faced Moore. Their strengths were evenly matched. Shui Zhuan was better at coordination, and their short passes under the basket were lively and commendable. They led all the way. Moore followed closely behind, trailing by a few points. Zhang Liangxiong scored points with long shots every time. The first half ended with 22 to 17. In the second half, Moore once chased to 23 to 26, only three points behind. But afterwards, Shui Zhuan regained momentum and scored again and again. The final result was 36 to 26. Shui Zhuan won.</p>

<p>John Wins Against Nanxing (Group A)</p>
<p>In the Group A game, John battled Nanxing. The game was evenly matched. Within the first ten minutes, the score fluctuated, creating a tense situation. John first scored two consecutive goals by Ma Fangcui, creating a momentary sensation. But before long, Nanxing went all out. Cheng Wen'e and Liu Liangfeng scored one after another, exceeding with 11 to 8. John worked harder and had many good performances. Nanxing's defense was slightly relaxed, and John scored continuously. Soon, the score became 27 to 15, far ahead. Nanxing suddenly chased straight up. The first half ended with 22 to 29. At the beginning of the second half, Nanxing was full of momentum, with tight defense and active forwards. Zhou Shu'an scored several goals in a row, suddenly exceeding with 32 to 31 again. At this critical moment, John relied on Zhang Shirong and Tong Guochun's scoring to reverse the decline and see the light of day. Xu Wenkui repeatedly showed his fierce and agile skills under the enemy's basket. The score soared. The final result was 51 to 41. Nanxing was exhausted and defeated.</p>

<p>Today's Hanliang vs. Jiangwan is Bound to Be a Fierce Battle</p>
<p>The Iron City Cup Basketball Tournament was still held last night with the enthusiastic support of hundreds of spectators. A total of four Group B games were played, both men's and women's. In the men's Group B game, Anshan defeated Jiangdong. The Anshan team members were strong and powerful, but their movements were too brave and they fouled a lot. In the future, they should pay attention to methods and win by skill. Then they will be able to improve even more. In the second game, Tianxing defeated Chongyi. In the first game, Quanhei defeated Jingwu. The scores were also close and the competition was fierce. Finally, in the women's Group B game, Aiguo faced Liangjiang B. The latter was able to compete and was used to fighting. The victory or defeat was already expected. As a result, Liangjiang defeated Aiguo with a score of 22 to 6. In today's competition, there is a battle between Hanliang and Jiangwan A in Group A. Hanliang is the incarnation of Yuqing and has Filipino players who participated in the National Games. However, Jiangwan A is also another name for Fudan. The tension of the performance at that time is self-evident. The results of yesterday's game and the schedule for today and tomorrow are recorded below:</p>
<p>Yesterday's Results</p>
<p>Anshan Wins Against Jiangdong (Group B3) 31 to 13</p>

<p>Liangjiang Wins Against Aiguo (Women's B) 22 to 6</p>
<p>Liangjiang B Wins Against Aiguo</p>
<p>In the first half, Aiguo was not used to the strong defensive battle, and fell forward and backward, without scoring a single goal. Liangjiang declared victory with a large lead of 14 points. In the third, Fan Sui entered the field as a substitute, and Aiguo took the opportunity to rise and gather as many as six points. The battle situation was even fiercer in the final quarter. As a result, Liangjiang B won with a score of 22 to 6.</p>

<h3 id="e192">Finance Foreign Banks Suddenly Report Sharp Decline, Standard Gold Most Popular on the Market <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>Sellers Active at High Prices, Firm at the End, Heavy and Tired, Indian Silver Still Contracting, Still Rising Two Yuan and Seven Jiao, Long Positions Exceed Short Positions by 24</p>
<p>Yesterday, the gold market suddenly turned bullish due to the sharp decline reported by foreign banks. However, since our country has implemented stable foreign exchange balance tax controls, which are entirely to adjust the difference between domestic and foreign bank prices, large investors took the opportunity to sell at high prices, and banks threw out at high prices, leveling the tax at a low level, resulting in a sharp decline after the rise. In the morning, news that overseas silver markets in both the UK and the US had fallen, and that there were few buyers, caused the forward silver price in Montreaux to plummet by 2.45 to 5 points. Exchange rates were slightly longer, and the price of London gold shrank by one pence, stirring sentiment and turning it for the better. Off-market preliminary trading initially called for 45 or 46 yuan. The central bank's official exchange rate was announced, with both the UK and the US remaining the same, and the customs gold unit unchanged. The standard gold price was listed, reduced to 147 yuan. Gu Xingyong, Da Decheng, etc., had sold at 44 or 45 yuan. Da Fa, Yonghong, Kang Yongheng, Yu Laijin, and retail investors raised prices sharply, rising to over 48 yuan. Fu Xing, Yonghengchangyong, etc., sold again, reducing the price to 6 yuan. The opening in the morning was relatively high, and chaos ensued after the opening. Large investors took the opportunity to sell bars, and the market soon declined. Banks came to fill orders, making it even lower, but many still maintained after the low. There were repeated rebounds in the middle, but banks were too excited to sell, and the exchange rate listed by HSBC remained the same. The price continued to decline, once falling to 42.6 yuan. Banks took the opportunity to buy in cheaply, and buyers were active at the low, gradually pulling the price up. The white silver balance tax was announced, down 2.75 points, still falling, but banks still paid, making it easy to maintain. Indian silver was predicted to contract by three annas. The overall trend hovered at noon, and the market stabilized later. Indian silver initially reported a drop of 19-20 annas and then stabilized slightly. However, there were still many supplies taking advantage of the momentum, causing a slight decline. At this time, sentiment was mediocre, lacking change for quite some time. Later, Indian silver reported no change and a small drop of one anna, large investors became slightly more active, and the price rose. However, the selling pressure from large investors also increased due to the high price, making it difficult to sustain. Floating short positions also came to close, turning downstream. The closing still showed hovering. Overseas conditions may have the possibility of prosperity, but this port is under the central bank's stable exchange rate, making it difficult to advance. As the swap period approaches, large short positions are fearless, and long positions are in danger of collapse from time to time, posing a major threat to buyers.

<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange market suddenly trended toward hovering, and trading suddenly became quiet. At a time when the large amount of 100 million in total transactions had not been settled or swapped, both long and short sides suddenly announced that they were waiting and watching.

It was said that large investors had already shifted their gaze to the yarn, flower, powder, and wheat markets, indicating that speculative sales were the focus of market transactions. The course of yesterday's events was that four sessions were made, and the market price completely floated and sank between three and four jiao. Most large investors withdrew their hands, but there were slight swap transactions. The second session in the morning was the quietest, with four or five types unable to open. The one with the most ups and downs throughout the day was Troop Reduction and Reorganization 6, and the rest did not have many ups and downs.

As a result, all months fell by 1.2 to 2.2 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price. The afternoon session opened calmly, with Tongcheng, Yichang, Xincheng, and Dafeng taking profits and covering their positions. However, around the second and third rounds of trading, the market still entered a state of fatigue. However, spot yarn transactions remained good, so spot yarn prices were firm, and thread prices continued to move towards their peak. As a result, all months rose by 0.23 to 0.4 jiao compared to the morning session's closing price.

<p>Wuhu 10 Same Trade 260</p>
<p>The cotton market has fallen sharply, and the situation is very weak. The fifth U.S. cotton production estimate has been released, with a production of 10,734,000 bales, a decrease of 407,000 bales compared to the previous estimate of 11,141,000 bales. Although production has decreased, market prices have fallen by 15 to 20 pounds. As a result, the bulls were greatly disappointed, and gold firms sold off heavily, causing the market to become increasingly unsustainable. However, foreign firms are still buying, it is said.</p>
<p>Zheng Futures Cotton Market Deteriorates Greatly</p>
<p>The futures cotton market opened with near-month contracts holding steady, but far-month contracts fell due to the U.S. cotton production estimate being lower, yet market prices fell instead. This was because of the sharp contraction of silver prices by 500 pounds sterling in the Montreaux period. General speculation still considers commodity prices to be low, resulting in weakened confidence. Gold firm bulls suddenly came out to sell, causing market prices to plummet uncontrollably. Yichang and Yuanda took the opportunity to cover their short positions. However, attempts to curb the selling pressure were still unsuccessful, and as a result, all months fell by 0.55 to 0.9 jiao compared to the previous day's closing price. The afternoon session opened with a slight increase of 0.05 to 0.12 jiao, but the market remained poor during the first round of trading. By the close, far-month contracts rose slightly. As a result, near-month contracts fell by 0.05 to 0.25 jiao compared to the morning session's closing price, while far-month contracts rose by 0.1 jiao. Sales included 200 dan from Yuda, 1,900 dan from Tongji, 1,900 dan from Hengyi, 1,300 dan from Mingde, 4,000 dan from Hexing, 4,700 dan from Gengfeng, 3,800 dan from Shenji, 2,300 dan from Dachangcheng, 9,800 dan from Run Kang, 1,700 dan from Yuanxingchang, 1,900 dan from Fuyuan, and 2,500 dan from Changhe. Purchases included 3,500 dan from Dafu, 4,600 dan from Yuanda, 10,900 dan from Jinchang, 4,700 dan from Chunchang, 7,600 dan from Yichang, 3,400 dan from Xincheng, 2,200 dan from Yikang, 5,100 dan from Changhe, and 1,500 dan from Changji.

<p>(Tianjin Correspondence) The cotton yarn market in this city is particularly strong, and sentiment is quite bullish due to continuous export business, which has led to increasingly thin inventories. As a result, market prices have soared, and confidence has further strengthened. The opening prices of spot Qingdao yarn in Tianjin are listed below (unit: bale, including tax):</p>

<p>Yesterday, the U.S. cotton market opened with relatively active trading. All months fell by 4 to 8 points. The government report was favorable to buyers, but due to bull liquidation, Southern hedging, and the Cotton Stabilization Corporation's sales, buying activity was greatly hindered. Buyers are currently awaiting the Cotton Stabilization Corporation's confirmed plan and the High Court's ruling. Traders are still major buyers, and brokers also firmly believe that this new cotton can meet demand and are engaging in buying. Finally, due to large-scale bull liquidation, the market softened again. Spot prices fell by 15 points, and futures prices fell by 13 to 20 points. The Cotton Exchange estimates that global cotton consumption in October was 2,304,000 bales, compared to 2,298,000 bales in the same period last year and 2,172,000 bales in the same period two years ago. English spot cotton rose by 1 point, and futures remained unchanged. Indian cotton was sold by European exporters and Japanese traders. Flat Kinar rose by 0.5 to 0.75 rupees, Oomra rose by 0.25 rupees, and Broach rose by half a rupee. The original telegram is recorded on the left (dated 9th).</p>

<p>The flour market was stable at first, but then it plummeted again. Quotations for foreign wheat from Chicago and Canada fell by about 0.2 jiao. However, at the opening, sentiment was relatively strong due to the sharp rebound the previous day, and near-term contracts were stable, while far-term contracts were slightly better. But after the second round of trading, rumors that the U.S. would abandon its silver policy caused the bulls to become nervous and sell off, causing the market to fall uniformly, dropping by as much as 0.3 to 0.4 fen compared to the opening. When the afternoon session opened, it was calm at first, but in the second round of trading, another large amount of bull liquidation caused a further drop of 0.1 to 0.2 fen. After the third round, sentiment gradually stabilized, and there were fewer sellers. Near-term contracts remained unchanged, while far-term contracts rose by 0.1 fen. Observing the later trend, if spot foreign wheat is active in the market, sentiment will likely continue to soften.</p>

<p>The wheat market opened in the morning, generally seeing a stable start followed by a sharp decline. Quotations for foreign wheat fell by about 0.1 to 0.2 jiao. Market sentiment was initially cautious, and traders were considering reducing wheat imports. The near-month flour market also softened step by step, causing the bulls to become nervous and sell off sharply. Each month fell by 0.3 to 0.7 fen compared to the opening. When the afternoon session opened, this month's contracts were fixed because spot prices had not fallen significantly. Far-term contracts fell by another 0.3 to 0.5 fen due to very weak customer sentiment. Trading was very active. All months from January onwards fell by more than 0.1 jiao. The spot wheat market softened due to the loosening of standards, and prices fell by 0.2 to 0.3 fen. Shandong Yingzhou wheat was quoted at 4.82 yuan, Guandian wheat at 4.81 yuan, Jiangbei Danyang wheat at 4.8 yuan, Yangzhou wheat at 4.77 yuan, Shaoyu wheat at 4.6 yuan, Hankou wheat at 4.5 yuan, and substandard at 4.5 jiao.

<p>Yesterday, the arrival of late rice was still abundant, especially from Jiangxi and Wenzhou-Taizhou. Production in all parts of the Yangtze River is abundant this year, and there will be continued arrivals in the future. 6,000 to 7,000 bags arrived yesterday. Customers and speculators have not yet started buying, and the market shows signs of softening. However, because the local grain shops still have a large appetite, the market is still holding up. 2,320 bags of Gan rice, 1,500 bags of Wenzhou-Taizhou rice, 700 bags of Sandu-Hankou rice, 366 bags of Fuzhou rice, and 300 bags of Yong rice were sold throughout the day. Prices were similar to the previous market, and all sales were to local grain shops, it is said.</p>

<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the supply from various firms surged, with a total of more than 70 firms arriving (a total of more than 14,000 piculs). The local market was not active, and baggers only handled more than 3,000 bags from Tianjin, Qingdao, Yantai, and other firms. Therefore, the situation was weak. Early japonica rice fell by 0.2 jiao, thick early japonica rice fell by 0.1 jiao, and Dujian rice followed suit. Yangjian rice was stable, and Yinyuan rice fell by 0.1 chi.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, 53 or 54 firms arrived from various routes downstream of the river, and there were 250 to 260 ships docked downstream. The sales of white japonica rice in the city were average, and speculators continued to pick and choose, causing prices to fall slightly by about 0.1 jiao. Early rice arrivals were low, and sales were active, with prices slightly soft. Thin japonica rice sales were flat, with prices slightly outside of 0.1 jiao. Yangjian and Bujiantou rice prices were soft by several fen, custom rice trading was slow, and Baiyuan wine shops were inactive. Retail sales were still possible, and prices showed a soft trend. The prices of other goods were also soft.</p>

<p>In the past two days, the Shanghai silk market has gradually recovered its strength. Moreover, overseas silk prices continued to rise yesterday (New York spot prices rose by 3.5 cents, and Yokohama spot prices rose by 12 yuan), so sentiment in Shanghai was also strong. Trading was limited throughout the day. Mitsui &amp; Co. slightly increased purchases, buying white factory silk with a degree of 78 and a size of 20 to 22 denier at a price of 760 yuan, an increase of 30 yuan compared to last week.</p>

<p>Yesterday, in the foreign tea market, green teas such as needle-leaf, eyebrow-leaf, and fine eyebrow-leaf from regular tea estates continued to sell well in Europe. Jardine Matheson continued to buy large quantities. Prices did not rise or fall. However, although British and French merchants sent out numerous telegrams to inquire about drawn-core fine eyebrow tea, merchants remained cautious because actual sales in Morocco were not moving. The sales of other goods such as Hee Pearl Tea were also sluggish.</p>

<p>White lead sheets #5 and #6 have been heavily sought after by battery factories recently, and market supplies have been almost completely purchased. Prices have soared, with offers reaching as high as 35 yuan per piece, but there is still no stock available for purchase. In addition, the market situation for other colors such as #1 and #9 is not very bleak because small-batch transactions are still common. The price for #2 is 29 yuan, and for #9 it is 26 yuan. However, there has been no trading in other colors such as #3, #4, #7, #8, #10, and #12 recently. The stagnation of the market is truly beyond what industry insiders could have predicted. As a result, prices are also extremely weak. #3 is quoted at 28.5 yuan, #4 at 28 yuan, #7 and #8 at 25.5 yuan, and #10 and #12 are quoted at around 27 yuan. It is heard that the overseas price has recently been 19 pounds, 17 shillings, and 6 pence, which seems to be an improvement of 17 shillings and 6 pence compared to before.</p>

<p>After cottonseed oil prices opened at 16 yuan, sellers have been holding on tightly for more than a month. Recently, due to the rise and fall of soybean oil and factories tightening their grip, buyers saw that the situation was unsustainable and began trading 200 dan yesterday. Prices opened at 16.5 yuan, an increase of 0.5 yuan compared to the previous offer. The goods were bought by local grain shops. Because market prices are already high, purchasing power has inevitably decreased.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the market trend was slightly tight. The association's assessment was that spot 24 coarse white sugar was traded at 22 yuan, up 0.1 jiao. Transit goods were quoted at 6.8 yuan, but no deals were made. Mian white sugar from the Zhenji Factory was unchanged at 20.7 yuan.

<p>—(Hua Ling)</p>
<p>— Winter Arrives in the Human World —</p>
<p>In the faint sunlight, with a slight, sometimes raging, roar of the northwest wind, the wheel of the seasons has rolled into the last season of the year.</p>
<p>"Winter", in the eyes of the rich, may not be as charming as spring, nor as bright and refreshing as autumn, but the only suffering is the cold air. However, with cars that come and go without being assaulted by the cold, and warm electric stoves and radiators in their homes, even if snowflakes are flying outside, they can say "Ha ha, there is no winter this year." If they are happy, they can enjoy the snow with a cup of wine, and perhaps even praise winter, taking a quote out of context, "Winter is lovely, it does not deceive me."</p>
<p>Look, the rich say "There is no winter this year", but the poor are shivering in the northwest wind, their teeth chattering. However, I tell you, those who are shivering in the northwest wind seem to deserve our sympathy, but I think they also each get what they deserve, because rickshaw pullers, dock workers, and those who sell their labor can sweat in the northwest wind. If they don't sweat, it means they are lazy. Who can sympathize with laziness?</p>
<p>However, with the weather getting cold and the northwest wind blowing, the issue of the rich and the poor is secondary. How will the disaster victims in the disaster areas, without clothing, food, or homes, spend this long winter?</p>
<h3 id="e211">Knitting Yarn <a href="#e211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>—Chen Liang</p>
<p>If one were to say that Chinese women are good at making use of their time, knitting yarn would be the most obvious and widely appreciated example. Female students in classrooms can listen to the teacher's lecture while knitting a yarn turtleneck sweater for their "cousin" with their slender fingers. Even when going to the gatehouse to check for mail, they will be knitting as they walk. They would rather sacrifice half an hour or an hour on applying nail polish than stop knitting yarn for a minute.</p>
<p>On trams, one often sees women wearing glasses, flat-heeled shoes, black armbands, and fountain pens hanging around their necks, huddled in the "first class" corner knitting yarn, their eyes fixed, their minds focused on the two bamboo needles, yet they will not miss their destination. She is a Christian type, a sharp and intelligent woman.</p>
<p>Walking into the park, on the warm sunny lawn, or next to the few maple trees, one will find a gentle and quiet girl busily working with her tender white rubber-like hands, either knitting a yarn hat for her younger brother, a vest for her older brother, or wrist warmers for her mother. The quiet fragrance of flowers, the quiet heart, and the urban poets who sigh repeatedly for the yellow leaves also linger around her, and the title of their poems is "The Girl Knitting Yarn."</p>
<p>The little kid next door also whittled two bamboo chopsticks, and who knows where he got a ball of dirty and unidentifiable yarn, and he knits and unravels it day and night. Recently, he has actually learned to knit patterns, but his father is a poor man who cannot afford a pound or two of yarn, so he has to knit for others, earning a little money to supplement the cost of oil, salt, and firewood. Everyone says that the little kid is smart and has good hands. But what's the use of it? Isn't it just "making clothes for others"? Poor little kid.</p>
<p>When the northwest wind starts blowing and the world is oppressive, the radiator and fur coat class is certainly immune to the cold. Those who have virtuous wives and loving mothers also have yarn sweaters to keep their bodies warm. Lonely people, to whom will they turn? When they see those women knitting yarn. Alas, they should just go ask the little kid!</p>

<p>— Wei Jing</p>
<p>Poets, in winter, find joy in gathering around the stove, composing verses about snow. Philanthropists, in winter, consider the plight of suffering victims, hungry and cold, with compassion. Vulgar men, in winter, seek pleasure in wine and women. I, however, neither compose poetry, nor possess wealth for charity, nor have any interest in such low-class pleasures. Therefore, I have neither fondness nor dislike for winter. I am me, winter is winter, we have nothing to do with each other.</p>
<p>However, in winter, I do have a particular fondness, and that is for being in bed. Although my quilt is not a fully domestic silk and cotton quilt, nor an authentic imported down quilt, being curled up, nice and warm, in an old cotton quilt is quite satisfying. Especially as the time to get out of bed approaches, it becomes even more inviting. At that moment, lingering a little longer, one can truly say that I would not trade it for being king. Because I believe that even the emperor, who has to attend court before dawn, cannot enjoy such leisure.</p>
<p>Whether being in bed is sweet or bitter, it’s really hard to describe, but the feeling is indeed pleasant. When about to get out of bed but not yet, turning over to one side, then to the other, and if there's a hole in the quilt corner, feeling a draft invading, in the blink of an eye, the quilt corner is pulled and tightly wrapped. Ah, at that moment, there's a sense of comfort that loosens every bone. If there are only three to five minutes left before getting out of bed, hugging the quilt tightly, staying warm, and closing one's eyes for a moment of relaxation, that feeling is far superior to a drunkard's cup in hand, by a hundredfold.</p>
<p>Usually, driven by the needs of clothing and food, one has to get up at dawn, and the longing for the quilt always brings a sense of regret. Only when Sunday arrives can one truly indulge. On Sundays in winter, because there are no worries, one usually doesn't wake up until nature calls after the sun is high in the sky. But the weather outside the quilt is like three or four months behind the season inside the quilt. So when the urge to urinate becomes unbearable, one grits one's teeth, crawls out of the quilt to relieve oneself, and then returns to the quilt, truly experiencing the joy of a disaster victim receiving relief. This fondness lasts until midday, when the quilt becomes cold and there's nothing left to be fond of, then one resolutely gets out of bed.</p>
<p>How joyous is the pleasure of being in bed - alas, each winter is only a short three months.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Thoughts</p>
<h3 id="e214">Random Notes on Fur Goods <a href="#e214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>— Nan Ding</p>
<p>Every winter, when the north wind howls, and the weather is freezing, people often wear fur coats for warmth. Wealthy families wear precious items like fox fur and gray squirrel, while less affluent families have sheepskin. Poor families sometimes even lack cotton clothing, not to mention fur coats.</p>
<p>There are many types of fur goods, of varying prices. Even within the same type of fur, there are differences in quality depending on where it comes from. In winter, people who wear fur coats should have a basic understanding of the sources and quality of fur goods.</p>
<p>Sea Otter: Sea otter is one of the most valuable types of fur. Northerners call it "Hai Hu," while Southerners call it "Hai Long." So "Hai Hu" and "Hai Long" are the same thing. Sea otter comes from the sea. It's an animal that grows in the ocean. Vladivostok produces a lot of it. The fur is thick and black, with a slight reddish-yellow tint, and its warmth is unparalleled. When it's in the sea, there's a thin layer of skin protecting the fur. Removing the skin reveals the warm and thick fur. Because it's difficult to catch, and extremely warm and durable, the price is very high. Moreover, the production is now very low, which naturally makes it even more valuable. Most of the sea otter sold on the market is old stock. Shanghai, especially Daji Cheng, has the most. Last year, they bought a large batch of fur goods from the Palace Museum, including a lot of sea otter, so they held a sea otter sale.</p>
<p>Sable: Sable fur is also a very precious fur, capable of melting ice and snow, so its warmth can be imagined. The largest production area is in Siberia, Russia. Because sables live in cold regions, Siberia has many. The best type is called black gold sable, which is black with golden-red highlights, and has white hairs on the surface, known as silver gun sable. The next best is purple sable, produced in places like Mongolia's Ganmu Que Si. There is also a Qing Gen sable, with green roots, but it is far inferior to purple sable.</p>
<p>Fox Fur: Fox fur is also most abundant in the Mongolian border region. It can be divided into white fox, fire fox, black fox, yellow fox, ordinary fox fur, and sand fox. Black fox is the most expensive, with pure black color and a reddish base. White fox is pure white like snow. Fire fox is the color of fire. Yellow fox is yellow. White fox skin is the most tender and light, feeling like nothing when worn, and its price is slightly lower than black fox. Fire fox is even lower. Yellow fox and ordinary fox fur are lower than fire fox, and sand fox is the cheapest, almost comparable to sheepskin. Fox fur coats are mostly made from fox pelts, which is the fox's body. The rest, made from fox legs, are called fox leg coats. Fox heads and fox paws can also be made into coats, with red fox leg being the most expensive and sand fox being the least.</p>
<p>Gray Squirrel: Gray squirrel has also become a precious item in recent years, with gray back being the best, made from the back skin of gray squirrels. It is produced in Northeast China, outside the customs. The gray squirrel from Jilin Province has thin and tender fur, called Guandong goods, which is the lowest grade of gray squirrel and not durable. Gray squirrels from places like Qiqihar have thick, old skin, with a black color and a reddish tint, called Su Lu squirrel, which is the top choice among gray squirrels. Catching gray squirrels is very strange. They are mostly caught in mountain valleys. After a heavy fog in winter, you can enter the mountains to catch them, and they are everywhere, and you can get a lot. If there is no heavy fog, it is impossible to find a gray squirrel. Therefore, people who catch gray squirrels consider foggy days to be the opportunity to enter the mountains, and it must be in winter, because the fur is full in winter. In autumn and summer, it is not yet fully grown, and in spring, it is the shedding season, so it is not usable.</p>
<p>Other fur goods include Tan skin from Gansu, Qing Zong sheep from Mongolia, and other types of fur, each with different origins. Shanghai's fur goods are the best in the country, because people who collect fur goods first select them through Shanghai merchants and then send them to other places. Therefore, Shanghai is the most suitable place to buy high-quality fur goods.</p>

<p>Chapter 22: Knightly Words Move Painted Lips, Beautiful Women Gather to Discuss, False Affection Startles Jade Wrists, Suffering Girl Escapes Captivity</p>
<p>Zhiqian had no choice but to stand up and wave his hand at him repeatedly. At the same time, he kept looking at the window on the back wall and pouting. When Bei Hai looked over there, it was Yueying's grandmother and mother, tidying themselves up and walking towards the back door. Behind them, there was also a man, who was the attendant of the Blue Commissioner. He followed behind them, grumbling. Bei Hai said: Mr. Cheng, does this situation mean that another problem has arisen? Zhiqian smiled: Of course there is some kind of relationship, otherwise, the attendant wouldn't bother following them like that. Bei Hai's eyes were fixed on the window, not moving at all. Only when he couldn't see the shadows of these three people did he say to Zhiqian: The Blue Commissioner came here to find something to do. People like Jia Duocai, who trample on women's rights, are worth investigating. Zhiqian smiled: Speaking from your standpoint, you probably think that everyone agrees with you. This was a casual remark, but it made it impossible for Bei Hai to continue the conversation. He calmed himself down after hearing these words, sat for a while, and then said, Mr. Cheng, do you have something to do? Zhiqian thought to himself, you suddenly came to find me today, and you suddenly want to leave, you know whether there is anything to do, why are you asking me? He smiled and said: I don't have anything to do, but I advise you to be more indifferent to things, don't be too enthusiastic. The more enthusiastic people are, the bigger the nails they hit. Bei Hai said: I'm not very enthusiastic, but I like to speak fairly. What does this matter have to do with me? I'm just meddling. As he said this, he had already started walking towards the outside. This time he didn't leave through the front door, but went straight to the back door. Sure enough, the Blue Commissioner's attendant was leaning against the doorframe, looking into the small doorway across the street. The two women were still walking in the courtyard. Bei Hai stood at the door and looked into the doorway. When the attendant saw him like this, he looked him up and down. Bei Hai was a little embarrassed, thinking that if he walked away, it would probably make people even more suspicious. So he smiled at the attendant and said: Mr. Commissioner thinks, aren't these two women very pitiful? The attendant had never heard anyone call him Mr., and seeing a student-like person addressing him like this, he was very happy. (375)</p>
<h3 id="e216">Winter Song <a href="#e216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>— Juan</p>
<p>A gust of north wind assaults, I know winter has arrived in the world. Winter! Don't be too cruel! In a blink of an eye, the Spring God will arrive, and finally drive you away. I have already compiled this winter special page, filled with an atmosphere of solemnity and desolation; I want to find some beautifying poems and lyrics to embellish it, but I scratched my head and pondered for a long time, but couldn't find anything. Oh, I have it, the day before yesterday, my brother Zhang Jinglu of Shanghai Magazine Company sent me several rare Chinese literary series, and my brother Ping Jinya of Central Bookstore also sent me several rare Chinese academic series. There is a Yuan Dynasty drama in the series, and a Neon Clothes Continued Score in the library. There are some pretty good tunes in it. When I turned them over, I found a Winter Song, and I quickly copied it below.</p>
<p>When winter comes, the wind gets worse and it clears up suddenly. I pick sparse plums and soak old vases, enjoying the remaining happiness. At that time, I follow my heart, and the mountains are charming, he is angry and hateful, good is suitable and evil is also suitable. Until the morning I look at him without turning my eyes, carefully watching him, forgetting the cold and heat, forgetting hunger and satiety, forgetting the cold. (See Yuan Dynasty Zaju)</p>
<p>Chrysanthemum branches are old, bamboo leaves are dry, it is only the beginning of the cold weather. The person has left, the hundreds of diseases of Qingqiu, dragging and teasing me, my mind is tired and my love is foolish. All day long, I am always sentimental, sitting alone in an empty room, lonely and deserted, searching and searching. The beast burner in the golden stove is frequently added, but it can't warm the old red sleeves, the cold penetrates the ice muscle, and the fairy eyebrows are damaged. This sentiment is lingering and subtle, besides plum blossoms, who else can I tell it to? I'm afraid of dusk, I can't bear to see the moon rising in the corner of the building. I only warm the quilt, and even the parrot is afraid of the cold and sleeps late. (Repeated) Waiting for spring to return, waiting for spring to return, but the person does not return, what should I do? (Repeated) (See Neon Clothes Continued Score)</p>

<h3 id="e217">Foreigner Appeals for Refugees <a href="#e217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>— Meng Ruo</p>
<p>A few days ago, this newspaper published a letter from a foreigner, saying that one evening, while passing Difeng Road, he saw two men and two women by the stone wall, each woman holding an infant. The two men were shouting "Selling children." Upon inquiring about their origins, he learned that they were farmers from the north who had fled to Shanghai due to the drought. Now they had exhausted their meager funds and had to sell their children to survive. He immediately offered them financial assistance and appealed to the police, the Royal Hotel, the Salvation Army, a major church, the Chinese and Foreign Relief Association, etc., to take them in, but they were all rejected.</p>
<p>This foreigner is indeed very kind. Seeing several famine refugees trying to sell their children, he was immediately filled with compassion. Not only did he help them with money, but he also appealed to various parties on their behalf. But the result was very disappointing to him. The hotel refused first, and then the charitable organizations closed their doors. So he sighed and said, "Alas! Is there really no place for these hungry birds to perch? Otherwise, why would everyone reject them?"</p>
<p>I think this kind foreigner must be new to China. That's why he was immediately filled with compassion when he saw this human tragedy. In fact, these kinds of things can be found everywhere in our country at any time. Selling children is nothing. Eating children's flesh is not that uncommon either. In this day and age, people say "necessity is the mother of invention." Now the people of our country are so poor that they can't be any poorer!</p>
<p>To be fair, the charitable organizations' refusal to accept these few refugees has its own reasons. Recently, waves of famine refugees from various places have been gathering in Shanghai. If you take in one, you have to take in all. I'm afraid that even if you build a thousand more of the largest shelters, they still won't be able to accommodate everyone.</p>
<p>But are we just going to let them starve and freeze to death? That doesn't make sense either. Foreigners have shown pity for the refugees in our country. Can it be that we are indifferent to our own compatriots and don't think about providing relief? Moreover, Shanghai is the most prosperous place in the country. As long as a group of wealthy people are willing to be generous, accommodating some refugees is not impossible. Therefore, we hope that Shanghai's charitable organizations will expand a few more refugee shelters this year to help our disaster-stricken compatriots. This is our duty, and it is also the morality that humans should have!</p>
<h3 id="e218">Childhood Longings <a href="#e218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>— Lin Hao</p>
<p>Childhood, disappeared as the wrinkles on my forehead marked line by line.</p>
<p>My hometown remains as it was, that little red birch tree that stood on the top of the small hill has grown so tall, swaying its branches in the wind. The mountain is still covered with green grass, dripping with last night's dew in the morning, more lovely in its emerald greenness. The goshawk keeps flapping its wings, flying back and forth in the tall forest, often chanting the song of freedom. But where is my nostalgic and lively childhood?</p>
<p>I have come again to the mysterious little road where I left many traces of childhood. It is a dirt road, a long and endless road covered by long weeds and moss, only exposing a foot-wide center of bare soil. Hide-and-seek, this is a very difficult place to find. People, blindfolded, pounce and grab randomly where the grass moves, but it is rare to be caught.</p>
<p>The grass on the road seems to be longer than it was in my childhood, just like I have grown.</p>
<p>In the clear and calm river, the little fish wag their big tails, still opening their mouths, and if any shadow sweeps across the surface of the river, they will shoot over with a flick of their tails.</p>
<p>If it were still childhood, how I would cherish this natural flow! Unfortunately, my heart is now like a water-scarce desert, unable to squeeze out a drop of refreshing nectar!</p>
<p>In childhood, I remember being afraid when I saw the sea, the surging waves, the turbulent whirlpools, the roaring tides, the magnificent water and sky connected without end, a child's heart beating fast. But in reality? I also felt the greatness of the sea, and that the sea would give you joy in your mind and body.</p>
<p>Now the sea in my heart is so ordinary and monotonous.</p>
<p>My heart is like a withered and dying tree, a desert, numb, as if it has lost its trembling function...</p>

<p>— Meng Xiao</p>
<p>The northwest wind is blowing with a sting. Little Sanzi is only wearing a tattered lined jacket, but he is anxiously looking... the ground is covered with a few inches of thick snow. Little Sanzi got up early and put the empty iron can on his wrist, hurrying towards the soup kitchen.</p>
<p>"If I had a silver dollar, I wouldn't die..." Little Sanzi mumbled, spitting hard and cursing, "Damn it, these kids, there's no law!"</p>
<p>His broken boots squeaked on the snow. Some of the snow had already been trampled solid, and his feet slipped as he stepped down. Little Sanzi ran for a while and felt a little tired. His stomach was also rumbling. He hadn't eaten all day, no wonder he felt weak. He thought to himself:</p>
<p>"Alas, every year is worse than the last. Last year in the Northeast, it didn't matter if I went hungry for three or two days. Now, my body is getting worse and worse. After being hungry for a day, it's like a smoker who hasn't had enough opium, I don't have the strength to do anything." He shook his head, and the snowflakes on the edge of his broken felt hat fell on his shoulders.</p>
<p>As Little Sanzi walked, he thought about those golden days when he was in the Northeast. Although he wasn't enjoying leisure, he had food and clothing. Like now, it's December, and there's a small western-style stove at home. As long as there are a few small coal balls, the room is very warm. In the evening, he might even go to Zhang Erzi's place to buy two ounces of white liquor and drink it slowly...</p>
<p>"Damn it, ×× people!" Little Sanzi cursed fiercely, suddenly feeling a little dizzy. He was too agitated.</p>
<p>"Son of a bitch, these bastards, made me suffer the insolence of those kids in the soup kitchen today?" With that, Little Sanzi thought of what had happened at the soup kitchen. "Those kids throwing their weight around, acting like officials, damn it ×, one day..." Little Sanzi's heart was on fire, and he accelerated his pace, as if his empty stomach was filled with anger.</p>
<p>There were more and more pedestrians on the road, and the trams were also leaving the factory. A child selling fried dough sticks darted out of an alley, shouting loudly.</p>
<p>"Third Brother, good morning! Going to the factory in Ximen?" The child selling fried dough sticks greeted him.</p>
<p>"Yes, are you going too?"</p>
<p>"Later, the factory doesn't open until 7:30! I'll just be drinking the northwest wind at the factory gate if I go too early!" The child walked away. Little Sanzi thought to himself, if I had some acquaintances or a little capital, it would be good to sell fried dough sticks. With my good hands and feet, I'm competing with those old men and women for this bowl of porridge. It's really--no progress!</p>
<p>He had already reached the edge of Xizhimen City, and a gust of north wind blew him back two or three steps. What a strong wind! Little Sanzi shivered and hurriedly tightened his collar, walking at an angle.</p>
<p>There were a few people on the road, also wearing broken tin cans on their wrists, some supporting the old and some pulling the young. They were going to the soup kitchen together. Little Sanzi looked at them and felt even more uncomfortable. He cursed himself:</p>
<p>"Competing with these old people and women for this meal is really too cruel--sin, sin!" Just as Little Sanzi thought this, another thought immediately refuted him: "What's the matter? Don't you have any capital? You have..."</p>
<p>He arrived at the soup kitchen. A decent-looking policeman was waving a stick, telling them to line up: "Whoever comes first, goes in first, don't push, don't shout! You must maintain--order!"</p>
<p>"What an act!" Little Sanzi looked down on these people. He muttered to himself.</p>
<p>"Officer, I can't walk anymore, please be lenient!" An old woman sat on the snow, begging the policeman.</p>
<p>"No! You have to line up. You can't go in if you don't line up!" He pointed at the old woman with his stick, shouting with a thick neck.</p>
<p>"Ouch--!" The old woman just climbed up and fell down again, lying on the ground, wailing.</p>
<p>"These bastards, putting on airs." Little Sanzi thought, just as he was about to go over, someone had already helped the old woman up.</p>
<p>"I can't stand up! My legs can't take it, you... Ouch--!" the old woman said, the tin can hanging on her wrist fell to the ground, tumbling and clattering, falling below the small pile of soil.</p>
<p>The door of the soup kitchen opened. Standing outside, you could see several large pots steaming with white smoke. Little Sanzi seemed to smell the fragrance of millet, and his saliva dripped uncontrollably. He waited anxiously, his stomach rumbling even more fiercely.</p>
<p>"Two and a half portions per person, yesterday there were still three." A young woman ran out, complaining unintentionally. "There's not even black beans left, just chaff."</p>
<p>When it was Little Sanzi's turn, he held up his tin can. He looked at the man holding the ladle with greedy eyes.</p>
<p>"You fix it, then give me half a portion!"</p>
<p>"Two portions per person, no one can have more!"</p>
<p>"They all had two and a half portions, why do I have two portions? We have to be reasonable, don't make a fuss!"</p>
<p>"Get out of here! Who's taking your money, owing you, selling to you?"</p>
<p>Little Sanzi turned around, muttering: "Listen, women get two and a half portions, we're not tender-skinned, so we get half a portion less! It's not like he's taking the money out of his own pocket, and he's still trying to take credit!"</p>
<p>"What are you shouting about! Take him to the police station, a lawless bastard!"</p>
<p>A black hand grabbed the back of Little Sanzi's head, and another hand grabbed Little Sanzi's arm. His tin can fell to the ground, some yellow rice porridge splashing on the snow, steaming.</p>
<h3 id="e220">Poverty <a href="#e220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>— Man Yin</p>
<p>I have always been content with poverty, and I have never had a moment's fantasy about the luxury and wealth of others swirling in my mind. As a person, as long as you are true to your own conscience, what does the emperor's power have to do with me? That's how I've lived my life until now. This summer, trying to help a friend, we both ended up losing our jobs. My friend repeatedly apologized to me, but since I could live with my conscience, I didn't resent anyone. But confined to my cramped attic room every day, I began to feel uneasy about poverty. My temper suddenly flared up, and I learned to scold people, even someone I had no connection with. Sometimes I would throw things, things I had bought with the price of my labor. I couldn't stand the pressure of over a hundred degrees. That old woman said I couldn't stand the threat of hunger, and to be content with poverty, you at least had to be able to fill your stomach. I began to understand how lotteries, gambling, and all the sins that the law doesn't allow come about. At that time, although I was no longer content with poverty, I hadn't yet crossed the line. When I found another job, I was content with poverty as usual. I was satisfied.</p>
<p>In my current job, the work is more demanding than before, but the pay is less than half of what it used to be. I've been in this job for nearly three months, and I'm doing my work with a clear conscience. I don't envy those who are "lying on firewood and tasting gall." Recently, the north wind has been howling, and the grass and trees are withering. Every night when I return home from work, my thin clothes can't withstand the cold wind. Often, when I'm walking slowly on the side of the road instead of taking a car, I can't help but glance at those people in heavy fur coats, and I silently think that they probably don't feel the terror of winter. When these thoughts invade my mind, I know that I'm starting to become dissatisfied with my life again. To do things with a clear conscience and be content with poverty, there's also the condition of protecting body temperature besides filling your stomach.</p>
<p>These days, I can't help but become lazy at work, hoping to see if those who are well-fed and warmly clothed might bestow a bit of unexpected sympathy. But nothing happens. They immediately feel that the price they paid isn't yielding the expected results and become angry. I'm scolded by those people like a pig or a dog. On the way home, I think about committing sins that go beyond the pale, planning how to retaliate against those people, or how to acquire an unexpected sum of money so I can join their ranks and show them off. As I'm walking along, thinking about this, on the side of a department store, I'm blocked by a group of vagrants. When I try to turn around and take another road, a police officer suddenly appears and takes the vagrants away. From the passersby's discussion, I learn that those vagrants were抢奪搶奪搶奪搶奪 the department store's sidewalk space. Because there's a generator in the department store's basement, the electricity spreads along the sidewalk, making even the cement unusually warm, and those vagrants wanted to抢奪抢奪 it as a place to avoid the cold for the night. I'm moved by this scene. I should focus on my work. I'm not the poorest person in the world. Perhaps there are thousands upon thousands of hands trying to seize my job, and thousands upon thousands of eyes envying my thin cotton clothes. (One of the winter night essays)</p>

<p>Daiyu Laments Autumn</p>
<p>Sad flowers, sad grass, a dreary sky. A chilling wind and rain beat against the window curtains. A thousand emerald bamboos rustle in the wind. A garden of fragrant grass is covered in drizzling rain. In the Xiaoxiang Pavilion, silence reigns. The flower-burying maiden is listless with illness. Thinking of her, she is full of sorrow, sickness, and even more resentment. Lamentable, singable, and pitiable. Her face is even thinner than a plum blossom. Her delicate breaths are as thin as a wisp of smoke. She is a sickly Xishi, unable to withstand the wind. A sorrowful Xi Gui remains silent. All day long, she dabs at the grease marks on her face and washes away tears. The medicine furnace and tea stove are steeped in sorrow. All one sees is that the prescription on the desk is a foot thick. The mirror on the dressing table lacks luster. Look at her, sitting listlessly, abandoning her toilette, weary of sleep. In her sorrow, she divines her heart's affairs in dreams. She barely manages to tidy the snow-white hair at her temples. The pearly tears well up like a spring. She languidly rises from the bed after knocking the red beans to pieces. She wearily goes to sleep late at night after picking out the wick of the green lamp. The plum blossom paper tent fails to conjure a dream. The lotus-silk embroidered quilt is half-cast aside. Deep in autumn, she still wears her gossamer-thin garments. Fresh tears still cling to the green gauze curtain. Zijuan wipes away tears as she attends to the tea caddy. Xueyan grieves as she tends to the smoke from the medicine. All one hears are her constant coughs and sighs. She clutches her intestines and weeps silently. She says, "Zijuan, people say that autumn is a time for enjoying the scenery. Why is it that when I, your mistress, see autumn, my sorrow only increases? Look at that autumn moon, hazy and cold as water. The autumn wind is rustling and cold as scissors. The autumn light flows like the wanderer's journey, the autumn rain drips, stirring thoughts of autumn. The autumn insects chirp, wanting to break the soul. Although autumn is just beginning, my dreams are already chaotic and disordered. The autumn mountains are silent, luring travelers to become drunk. The autumn waves roll, urging guests to return home. So much of the autumn scenery is distressing. That is why I, your mistress, cannot bear to mention the word 'autumn.' Alas, I, your mistress, am far from my homeland, thousands of miles away. My drifting existence is here. I crane my neck, but cannot see my homeland. Lonely and bitter, like a lone goose. Planning to rebel against my family and country is like a pie in the sky. I fear that returning to my old home will become an empty promise. I imagine that a lump of yellow earth will be in a desolate place. My withered bones will be buried in a foreign land. Moreover, my parents have already withered like autumn leaves. Why should a crabapple bloom brightly in the sun? When sorrow gathers, the nights seem like years. When sickness comes, the autumn months seem like years. I think back and forth about the three autumns of a single day. The five winds and ten waves make for thousands of miles. My intestines twist nine times, and my heart is quiet. I hate to declare the three stacks of Yangguan Pass. I only fear that medicine will be unable to cure my illness. It will only be that time passes in vain, a fleeting life. That is why I, your mistress, will not open my mirror case when I am about to die. I vow never to wear gold ornaments again. I, your mistress, always spend my youthful days in sorrow. I entrust my every thought to my sorrowful spirit. I, your mistress, have treated a fickle man as a passionate lover. Who knows that the Tushita Heaven is actually the Heaven of Departure and Hatred? To this day, good things vaguely become illusory dreams. The warmth and coldness of human relationships have all changed like mulberry fields. Soft words and gentle speech are all false. How can there be eternity? All of this is because I am willingly taking on suffering because of my karma. I am binding myself like a stiff silkworm, using rushes to punish myself. Is it not true that I am grieving from the bottom of my heart, pursuing the past without limit? My firm will to repent has already turned into a spring. Alas, I, your mistress, am sick and dying, and no one asks after me. I lie on my bed, and who pities me? Alas, I, your mistress, secretly sheds tears under the rain-drenched lotus leaves. The dewdrops on the lotus pods are a field of bitter hearts. Alas, I, your mistress, sees no one's shadow offering comfort at my bedside. Only illness comes to my pillow. Alas, I, your mistress, has no interest in reciting poetry. I have no inclination to play the zither. Alas, I, your mistress, the inkstone pool has long been dry and teeming with 鱓魚. I cannot bear to continue writing the poem about burying flowers. I am most afraid to hear the cuckoo singing on the branches, startling my good dreams. I am most afraid of the parrot in front of the window learning my words. I am most afraid to hear the wind tinkling the iron horse bells, clear as speech. The rain sprinkles the cold window, thin as smoke. That Lady Lin cannot bear the joy of autumn. It is pitiful, one drop of blood and tears, one word of lament. I wonder why He Zhi is so ill-fated. Why is writing talent forbidden for beautiful women? I want to loudly question the heavens in the sky."</p>

<p>Opening: "Beheading Han Xin"</p>
<p>Ke Han was Han Xin in those years. He was, in essence, a struggling person wandering the streets. At that time, he hadn't met the true lord destined by Heaven. It was as if a dragon was trapped in the water, suffering hardship. He once met a prostitute who washed silk floss for him. He received a deep kindness from a beggar who gave him a meal. Later, he repaid the kindness with a thousand gold pieces. He was, a poor man standing on the street with an empty purse. He carried a dragon spring sword on his back. He ignored the taunts of the butcher's son. He ignored the shame of enduring humiliation under the crotch. He abandoned his pen and joined the Han army. But alas, he was full of strategies but hadn't met his opportunity. It was all because he accidentally boasted of his great ambitions after getting drunk. He almost suffered torture at the city execution grounds. Therefore, he secretly fled at night. Xiao He chased Han Xin under the moon. Golden words of advice from the Han ruler protected him. He ascended the altar and was appointed a great general. The sound of the wind and the cries of the cranes chronicled his achievements. The two heroes, Chu and Han, fought fiercely. Han Xin was, like a bamboo splitting, defeating the Overlord. His strategies wiped out the Xiang army. It was all because of his great efforts and hard work. He was made the King of Chu and stationed in Huaiyin. Once suspected, he was lured in. His title was stripped, and he was made a Marquis, his command of troops was taken away. It was all because the Han Emperor was indulging in pleasures in the palace. He enjoyed the warmth and joy of rewarding beauties. He indulged in dreams of butterflies and pursued pleasure. He ignored the grand court of the magnificent empire. Therefore, Han Xin secretly rebelled in Huaiyin. How could he know that Lu Zhi would lure him into the palace? Alas, he was murdered in the bell chamber. The good bow is hidden when the flying bird is gone. Once achievements turn into a painted cake.</p>

<p>Will be shown at the Grand Theater</p>
<p>British famous novelist John Buchan's "The Thirty-Nine Steps" has been put on the screen. It tells the story of an international spy ring that obtains a very complex diagram, which is closely related to Britain's new air force plan. Because of time constraints, they do not have enough time to photograph or copy it, so they go to a psychiatrist, because this psychiatrist has a special memory. No matter what he sees once, he will remember it forever. Thus, all kinds of unexpected situations arise from here."</p>
<p>The protagonists of this film, Robert Donat and Madeleine Carroll, have achieved amazing results in their performances. With the famous work of John Buchan, who is known for writing thrilling novels, and directed by Hitchcock, who is known for directing horror films, plus starring in well-performing stars, of course, there will be very satisfactory results. The film is scheduled to be screened at the Grand Theater starting this Friday.</p>

<p>This year's Lianhua production, "Tian Lun," which is the most talent-rich, is scheduled to be screened at the Grand Theater International starting today. The filming of this film lasted for several months, from the depths of winter to the heat of summer, with painstaking efforts, gathering 90% of talent, and jointly producing it. The main purpose of the play is to promote the love of family, expanding from the narrow sense of familyism to the broad sense of greater unity. Since its opening, the Grand Theater has never screened domestic films. The fact that it is making an exception to screen domestic films this time shows how well the film has performed, which is undoubtedly a ray of dawn for the future of the entire Chinese film industry.</p>

<p>— Zhi Yu</p>
<p>It is said that the performance of "Song of Rejuvenation" in Nanjing cannot make money. Zhou Boxun, who "knows virtue and repays virtue," said that it is because there are no female stars who can draw a crowd; therefore, he personally went to Huabei to invite Yuan Meiyun to go.</p>
<p>The "betrayal" of the "boss" 's subordinates once aroused the complaints of Zhou "comprador." Now, I don't know where the "boss" 's audience has gone. To the extent that they have to invite Yuan Meiyun to "go to Beijing" from Shanghai, this, Zhou "comprador" will have to come up with another complaint, right?</p>
<p>It is said that "Tian Lun" has an English trailer, which is quite international, so it is expected that when it is shown at the Grand Theater today, there will also be some Western audiences. Someone said that "Urban Scenery" also had quite an international gimmick when it was screened.</p>
<p>Shen Xiqin went to Hangzhou, and there is still no news of his return. Someone said: Even if he returns to Shanghai, the monster will not engage in film business and is preparing to go to Guangxi to teach and make a living.</p>
<p>(Someone said: Is it "unstable footing"?)</p>
<p>The first issue of "Movie Fan Weekly" has been published. The three editors saw that the typesetting was upside down and full of mistakes. The second issue has been temporarily suspended, and the manuscript will be sent out again after there is a guarantee in printing.</p>

<h3 id="e231">The American Automobile Industry is Gradually Recovering and Prospering <a href="#e231" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c231" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">231</a></h3>
<p>— Yu</p>
<p>Manufacturers Implement New Cooperation Plans—Reasons for Advancing the Date of the Annual Auto Show</p>
<p>The automobile business in the United States, after several years of hard work, is now gradually moving towards improvement. Just like American Automobile Manufacturers Association Chairman Alvin Macauley likened it, he said in essence that the current automobile manufacturing industry is like playing soccer. After everyone's communication work, the ball has been repeatedly obtained by us. Continuing to use the communication method, the obtained ball is kicked to the enemy's position. After such a reversal of danger, the spirit of the players is refreshed, everyone is particularly excited, and they have the courage to win outwards.</p>
<p>The above-mentioned determination to win is now buried in the hearts of the leaders of the automobile manufacturing industry. Since they won the ball back in 1932, they have been working hard and doing a good job of communication. The ball is often placed under their jurisdiction and passes the middle line, shooting directly on the road to recovery and prosperity. Car manufacturers are now using a good strategy, that is, in terms of product, constantly striving for perfection, so that the value of the car exceeds the price paid by the customers. This is the most effective and always good strategy in an invincible place.</p>
<p>Taking the facts, the amount of cars produced this year really matches the metaphor cited above. According to the forecast, the production of automobiles and commercial trucks in the United States this year will be about three, six hundred and seventy-five thousand vehicles. This number not only exceeds last year's output by 28%, but also increases by about two and a half times compared with the production in 1932. According to the available figures, the retail sales in the domestic market in 1935 were 38% higher than last year. More than 40% for passenger cars, and more than 30% for trucks. Calculated on Labor Day, the number of retail cars this year has exceeded the total sales in the twelve months of 1932.</p>
<p>Speaking of foreign sales, because of the increasing needs of the world, it is expected that the total number of exported cars in 1935 will reach 535,000, an increase of 27% compared to last year. There are more than one reasons why foreign trade can improve so much. The most obvious is the stability of foreign exchange, the establishment of reciprocal tariffs between countries, and the gradual recovery of prosperity in major countries, and the increase in the value of American-made cars, etc. All have a related relationship.</p>
<p>The debut of the new autumn model car is even more helpful for foreign sales. American-made cars were marketed to the Southern Hemisphere for the first time this year. When their important sales season begins, new cars can be sold in a timely manner. When the European Auto Show is held, American-made European cars will also be offered at the same time. The number of American shipments to the Southern Hemisphere has increased significantly in the past two years. New cars will continue to be exported next spring. It is predicted that about 60% of the total exports will be sold there.</p>
<p>The number of new 1936 cars that can be sold abroad should be around 650,000. In this way, workers will benefit greatly in terms of obtaining work, whether directly or indirectly. It is estimated that 125,000 people will get jobs in the car manufacturing, parts, tires, and other related industries. It has to be said that it is a great help. There is also a more solemn estimate that the number of new 1936 cars sold abroad is roughly 635,000.</p>
<p>Recently, American car manufacturers have implemented a very good spirit of cooperation to stabilize car production. This plan has started this year. One end of this plan is to hold the annual car exhibition two months earlier. It opened in New York in November this year. The overall main purpose of the cooperation plan is to make the work of the automobile manufacturing industry and its related industries to be evenly distributed, and not to reduce work in the slack seasons.</p>
<p>The main significance of this cooperation plan can be observed from various facts. Usually, the number of car sales fluctuates due to seasonal reasons, causing the production volume to sometimes be high and sometimes low, and the work of the workers is greatly affected. Sometimes the production volume in slack months is 30% lower than that of busy months. Because the normal production volume cannot be maintained in winter in preparation for spring sales, the work that workers have obtained at this time in previous years is relatively limited.</p>
<p>In order to solve this problem and improve the working conditions of workers, the manufacturers have started an ambitious plan this year. One of the features is to advance the annual car exhibition, which was held in January in the past, to mid-November. In the past thirty years, the auto show has been opened in January as usual. In addition, the manufacturers have also agreed to adopt a new plan in terms of ordering raw materials, so that workers in various industries related to automobiles can obtain the greatest work benefits. On the one hand, it allows the automobile manufacturers' own workers to obtain full work in January and February, manufacturing various new car parts that will be launched in the spring.</p>
<p>In the past two months, other important industries in the United States have also adopted a drastic change. The tightening that was implemented from autumn to autumn has now changed its policy. Because since September, it has been felt that there is a need to increase. For example, the steel industry has more than doubled compared to the same period in the past. Other railways, mining, etc. also have the same phenomenon. As for the various large and small industries related to renting car manufacturing, it goes without saying.</p>
<p>If you want to make the above plan a success, then there are two major points that cannot be ignored. First, the number of retail sales in winter must increase. Second, the current spirit of cooperation between labor and management must be well maintained. The sales of sedans in the car market are getting better year by year. Because the manufacturers' production, sedan-style cars account for 99% of the total. And modern roads can enable vehicles to drive in all seasons. For these two reasons, the car sales this winter are expected to be very impressive.</p>
<h3 id="e232">Another Ironclad Proof of the Safety and Reliability of the New Dodge Automobile <a href="#e232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>— Yun</p>
<p>Those who have visited the Dodge inspection grounds, upon witnessing the various rigorous tests to which Dodge automobiles are subjected, almost invariably shake their heads and sigh, believing that the tests performed on the Dodge by the inspection machines are exceedingly cruel. However, from another perspective, these rigorous tests are actually an expression of humanitarianism and can by no means be considered cruel. The sole purpose of the inspection is to use experimental methods to definitively prove the safety and reliability of driving.</p>
<p>According to Dodge engineers, this type of inspection machine is called the "Belgian Roll." One day of testing a Dodge automobile on this machine is equivalent to the wear and tear it would experience in several years of arduous service under ideal conditions. Therefore, any minor flaws are bound to be discovered immediately and cannot be concealed. If it were for daily driving, such minor defects would never be noticed even after years. The Dodge automobile is uniquely able to successfully handle these absolutely rigorous and uncompromising tests, proving that its chassis, body, engine, wheels, and all other parts of the car are perfect, and that its driving safety and reliability have been further proven.</p>
<h3 id="e233">The above is a heroic image of the new Dodge six-cylinder two-door convertible. <a href="#e233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<h3 id="e234">The Function of the Newly Invented Flag Brand Bosch Battery Charger <a href="#e234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>— Fu</p>
<p>At a time when coil ignition is most widely used and the types of electrical parts on automobiles are increasing daily, the most necessary and indispensable item is the storage battery. If the storage battery can fully exert its effectiveness without any shortcomings, then even in extremely difficult and challenging situations, it can be easily managed and overcome. All of these situations are well known to those in the automotive industry who have experience. Since the function of the storage battery is so extensive and important, the invention of the new Flag Brand Bosch charger has great value and an important contribution that goes without saying.</p>
<p>The Flag Brand Bosch charger is a truly economical and cost-effective new invention. Using this device to charge the battery overnight will naturally ensure that the battery has ample power. Therefore, driving the car the next morning will start instantly and respond immediately. The lifespan of the storage battery itself is also extended as a result. Furthermore, what is especially commendable is that this device can fully charge the battery in two nights without any risk of overcharging. When the battery reaches its maximum capacity, the charging rate automatically reduces to a trickle, causing no damage to the battery.</p>
<p>It is said that this charger is of no small benefit to car owners who have car radios, as it can be used to make the radio's sound extremely clear and pleasant. As for families who only use their cars on weekends, they only need to purchase one of these chargers to completely solve the problem of weekly battery charging and save a lot of trouble. Moreover, this charger is not only suitable for car owners but also needed by doctors, wholesale merchants, laundry workers, bakers, collectors, department stores, etc. This device comes in two styles for use with large and small batteries. The electricity it uses is similar to that of a medium-sized light bulb, making it very economical.</p>

<p>Second Year Construction Routes</p>
<p>(1) Complete the Limeng Road. The roadbed of this road, which starts from Zhangcun, east of Lipu city, to Duying in Mengshan, a distance of 25 li, has long been completed. The roadbed from Duying to Mao'ertang, a distance of 27 li, and the bridge and culvert projects are not very large. However, the section from Mengshan city, passing through Shuidou, crossing Xinkai Datang,绕 Bai Zhulong, passing Xiaoshuiyong, and reaching Chencun, and then from Chencun, passing through Junchang,绕 Shangtiangang, crossing Pingdongyong, and reaching Taiping, is 140 li long. The road work is relatively large, and there are many bridges and culverts. The section from Taiping to Mengjiang has been open to traffic for a long time and does not require further construction. The distance from Lipu to Liuguihe and other places is similar. If the entire Limeng line is open to traffic, the traffic between the Gui area and the Wuzhou River will be very convenient. Even the passenger and cargo traffic in the Liuzhou area along the Liujiang River can繞 Lipu to reach Mengjiang and the Wuzhou River. Not only can the traffic between Gui and Wu, and Liu and Wu, be achieved in one day, but also passengers from Guilin, Liuzhou and He can take a boat upstream after arriving in Mengjiang, passing through Wulin along the Rongwu Road to Rongxian, and reaching Yulin. With the road circulating smoothly, the Limeng line can not only directly connect the highways of the Liuzhou and Guilin areas to the big river, but also connect the routes of the Liuzhou, Guilin, and Wuzhou areas with each other. The relationship is very important for internal transportation. It was originally planned to be built at the same time as the first-year lines, but since the first year required more than two million yuan, adding this line would place an excessive burden on the treasury. Therefore, it was decided to complete this line in the second year after the completion of the first-year lines.</p>
<p>Third Year Construction Routes</p>
<p>(1) Build the Jiuda Road. This road starts from Jiudunxu in Du'an, passing through Tiantacun, Lantang, Wengdong, Yaonan, Lizi, Xia'ao, Guangjiong, to Naling. It is mostly rugged and winding, with towering cliffs and strange rocks overlapping each other. The engineering is very large. The section from Naling via Baoping to Jiuxu is relatively straight. The section from Jiuxu via Changzhi to Dachang is difficult to determine. The entire line is more than 200 li long. After the completion of this road, the route from Qinzhou Haikou via Nanning, Wuming, Du'an, Chehe, to Liuzhai in Qian, compared to the route via Sa迁, Daqing, Hechi to Liuzhai in Qian, can shorten the journey by 300 li. It has a great relationship with the passenger and cargo traffic between Qian province and Haikou. From the perspective of the interests of the Gui, Yue, and San provinces, its importance cannot be compared to the Danchi Road. Therefore, it is planned to build the Limeng Road in the second year, and then build this line in the third year.</p>
<p>Fourth Year Construction Routes</p>
<p>(1) Complete the Hewu Road. This road starts from Hexian city, passing through Shuizhutang, Meihua, Malianjie, Xindu city, to Shatou, and then from Shatou via Shiqiao Fengmen Gorge to Shanxin, and reaching Dali River of Cangwu. It is 360 li long. Except for the section from Shanxin to Dalikou, which has already been completed, the roadbed of the 120 li section from Jiaxian city to Xindu city has also been built. However, the 150 li section from Huanghua in Xindu to Shanxin in Cangwu has not been constructed with roadbeds or culverts. The relationship between this road and the culture, economy, politics, and military of the Gui and Wu areas is as important as the Limeng Road, and it will be of considerable help to the development of the Fuhezhong mining area. Therefore, after the Jiuda Road is built in the third year, this line will continue to be completed.</p>
<p>(2) Build the Wuhuang Road. This road starts from Wuxuan city and ends at Dahuanjiang, which belongs to Guiping county. The section from Wuxuan to Xinluju is relatively flat. The section from Xinluqiao to Sanliwei is mostly mountainous. The section from Sanliwei via Sanjiangba to Dahongchongkou in Dongxiang also mostly runs along the mountainside. The section from Dahongchongkou to Hualeicun is quite rugged. The section from Hualeicun to Sanjiangwei is all gravel. In Sanjiangwei to Xinxu, there is a stone cliff gorge that can only accommodate one person walking, which is quite dangerous. From here, you will reach the Dahuanjiang River Estuary. The entire road is 200 li long. After the completion of this road, the Liuzhou area highway can be directly connected to the big river. Crossing the river south from Dahuanjiang can also be connected to the main line of the Wuzhou area highway.</p>
