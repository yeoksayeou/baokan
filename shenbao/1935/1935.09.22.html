<p>時評</p>
<h3>英美太平洋艦隊之調動</h3>
<p>— 星</p>
<p>意阿之戰事未發。而太平徉方面。已受重大影響。數日以來。英國之駐中國沿岸艦隊秘密西調。而美國太平洋艦隊。傳亦將渡巴拿馬而東航。日前駐威海衛之英艦克林威爾號。突在新加坡洋面出現。群疑紛起。九月十七日。英國海軍方面。遂禁止艦隊調動消息之宣佈。降至今日。英國駐華艦隊。蓋已所餘無幾矣。同時華盛頓方面之消息。謂海軍總長史璜生發表談話。使意阿果起衝突。則美國海軍當局。將準備調太平徉之軍艦移至大西洋。以保護美國航業之安全。所謂保護航業。蓋針對英國海軍之最近活動。及國聯之經濟制裁之計畫。歐洲多事。太平洋將有何結果耶。</p>
<p>夫英國於遠東利益。非不重視。於遠東危機。非不洞察。無如英帝國之生命綫。最主要者。在於地中海。紅海。及印度洋。新加坡至上海一綫。僅為此生命綫之續耳。故為保護生命主綫之安全。英政治家每不惜取蝮蛇螫手壯士解腕之策。大英帝國之領士廣漠。而其海軍數量。究屬有限。其在大西徉方面。如加拿大·西印度羣島及南美之利益。早諉命運於美利堅。不遑西顧。遠東方面。每遇歐洲緊急。必託日本。如歐戰之際南非戰爭之際。均利用英日同盟。以免其東顧之憂。至馬耳他蘇彝士與亞丁三處。則咽喉所在。臥榻之前。不容他人酣睡。故意阿之糾紛一起。英卽主張干涉。今大軍集中於地中海。保護帝國腹心。東方防務之空虛。亦不得已而然也。</p>
<p>至於美國軍艦之東調。蓋在對付英國於戰時干涉美國商船。以避免發生歐洲大戰時之悲劇。美國非國聯會員國。一旦戰起。英美關係。甚為複雜。蓋封鎖意國者。盡英國之艦隊。而對意之貿易。多美國之商船也。美國艦家之東西調動。每與華盛頓政府遠東政策有關。方其對日取强硬態度。大西洋艦隊卽向西調動。及對日本取妥協態度。艦隊卽又東調。自九一八至今。調動亦多次矣。頃者。英國因羅斯爵士之東來。同盟之呼聲甚噪。日美之問自菲列賓正式選出大總統。俄美外交之惡化。及美副總統之將訪東京。皆使人揣測蘭辛石井之舊事。是否重演也。方歐戰之際。英有事於西方。山東事件。二十一條事件。吾人當不致於忘懷。今日之日本。已非一九一四年日本之可比。而今日英美在遠東之威望。早非當年之可比。吾人觀英美艦隊之他調。亞洲門羅主義呼聲之日高。能無憬然於懷。思有以應付當前之環境乎。</p>

<p>瑪德里　社會黨頃以長文一件、送呈柴康拉總統用以說明該黨政見、據云辭職內閣所行所為多與憲法精神相昔廖尤以關於加泰隆省自治問題為然、綠該省依照憲法、原當享受自治權也、該黨爰乃提出四項主張、（一）解散衆議院、幷由忠寶共和政府辦理新選舉、（二）憲法所賦予之權利、均當恢復之、（三）釋放政治犯、（四）政府濫用職權之處、　確定其責任所在、此外凡曾執政之人、其能力不稱、因而停止普通法而採取特別法、以護其短者、此後不許參加政治、至關於對外政策、該黨王張西班牙應堅守國聯會各項原則云、（二十一日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>意內閣宣布　國聯建議難接受</h3>
<p>事前曾與英法大使接洽　英法內閣分別舉行會議</p>
<p>（羅馬）意內閣今日會議良久、卒拒絕國聯五國特委會和平解决意阿爭議之辦法、會議後發表公報、謂內閣會議對於特委會之努力固然感佩、然覺其提議之辦法不能接受、蓋其未有可為最後實現之充分的最低基礎、而切實顧及意國必不可少之權利也云、閣議由墨索里尼主席、墨氏報告政治與軍事形勢歷一小時之久、定九月二十四日再開閣員會議、（二十一日路透帘）</p>
<p>（羅馬）意內閣拒絕五國特委會建議一舉、在此發生之第一印象、卽為意國雖已對閉調解之門戶、但未下鍵、一般意人現覺五國特委會之工作將無從恢復、但尚有直接談判以謀解决之可能性、閣議後所發之公報措詞溫和、殊可注意也、（廿一日路透電）</p>
<p>（日內瓦）意國拒絕五國特委會建議之消息、使國　中人大為震動、蓋國聯初料墨索里尼當可接受特委會之建議、以作談判之基礎也、衆覺國聯現遇有其歷史中所未前存之最大難關、大戰以還、此為歐洲所遇最嚴重之時局、一般人意見皆主張擁護國聯盟約、衆意國聯行政院所决定採行之任何辦法、定可獲一致之贊助、各國代表對於意國之决議、皆為扼腕不置、（二十一日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）英國朝野聞意國拒絕五國特委會之建議皆為驚訝、但仍抱或有轉機之希望、意國旣有此决議、英內閣遂不得不於下星期舉行會議、首相鮑爾溫將於星期日晚回至倫敦、內閣會議或在星期一日舉行、但因意國决議尚未傳至日內瓦、故以星期二日舉行為近、意政府之行動、與其所將引起之後果、或將使英國會在休會限期十月二十九日以前重行召集、惟國際現局在最近之將來或綜雜如故、而使國會目前未便作公開之討論、果爾、則政府將商諸反對黨之領袖或將决議不提前召集國會、（二十一日路透電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）法內閣閣員正與總結會餐時、意相墨索里尼拒絕五個特委會建議之消息突然傳來、法閣員咸為震勁、法總理賴伐爾近在日內瓦曾有法國必不規避盟約下義務之諾言、法內閣將否實踐之、此為國人目前極願聞知者、衆料法國在英國給予遇有中歐事變時擁護盟約保障後、未必卽有反動、意國公報雖拒絕日內瓦計劃、但措詞尚屬溫和、故法內閣現尚泡此非意相最後一言之希望、法國觀察家解釋意國公報、認為含有意國願在外交方面繼續談話之意、（廿一日路透電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）法內閣今日舉行重要會議、大約討論為英國後援擁護國聯盟約至　程度之問題、閣議歷四小時餘之久、所發公報未言及此點、但謂法總統勒白侖代表內閣會議、向賴伐爾致賀並道謝、因其在日內瓦為和平起見、以法蘭西名由有勇敢練達之行為也、公報又稱、賴伐爾向閣員詳述外交大局、（廿一日路透電）</p>
<p>（羅馬）墨索里尼初次批閱國聯五國委員會之建議後、卽延見法大使狄香龍晤談、一面另飭外交次長蘇維克接見英大使德魯蒙晤談、政界方面對此頗為重視、惟對其結果則頗懷疑、內閣今日會議後、卽可答覆日內瓦、覆文中將加若干按語、俾五國委員會仍得繼續其工作、墨索里尼之態度旣有如此轉變、官方因急於聲明意國在東菲之軍事行動不過為警戒步驟、充其極、「將不超過殖民地征略之性質、如英軍之以坦克砲車及其他新式軍器在印度西北邊征略者然、」並稱、意國决不為引起歐洲糾紛之戎首云、（二十一日國民電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）消息靈通方面今日宣稱、官方雖無表示、但目前認意相墨紫里尼拒絕五國委員會之建議或將為墨氏願意重開三國會議之一種暗示、故五國委員會之努力即歸無效、日內瓦仍有繼續活動之可能、直布羅陀出入要道之處、現已滿佈障碍物、實際已封鎖、同時西班牙飛機一隊、計十五架、翱翔天空、增厚直布羅陀後方、荷蘭政府鑒於歐洲局勢之嚴重、今日决定充實軍力、以備國際變化、（二十日國民電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）今日得悉、英國無意如今晨所傳再開三國會議、英國現亦如意大利勢成騎虎、熟悉時局者不信英國將遣散其艦隊而袖手旁觀墨氏之鯨吞阿比西尼亞云、（二十日國民電）</p>
<h3>法外部發言人　否認對意制裁　海部否認調艦至菲港</h3>

<p>（巴黎）外傳駐都降港軍艦四艘、已奉命開往東菲法屬直　底港、此說現由海軍部正式否認（二十日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）法總理賴伐爾已電致墨索里尼促請其接受五人委員會之建議為討論意阿釋爭之根據、此為彙聞報所載之消息、該報又稱、賴伐爾並警告墨索里尼、今已臻和解之極度、法國不能史有所為、以助意國、賴氏且向英總代表艾登聲明、在任何緊急事態中、無論如何嚴重、法國將與英國駢膚行事云、（二十一日路透社電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）巴黎某報今日載有參院外交委員會主席裴蘭協氏所著一文、痛詆對意之制裁、謂軍事制裁、無論用何名義、必須加以排斥、又論及經濟制裁、謂德美日三大國旣置身局外、空談封鎖何益之有、按裴氏嘗一度任驗意大使、（二十日路透社電）</p>

<p>（羅馬）據此間負責方面聲稱外國各報所載意軍開赴利比亞之消息、殊屬失實迄今意國派往利比亞之軍隊為數甚少、僅為塡補由利比亞調往東菲之兵士者云、但據外人消息、意政府派往利比亞之援軍共約四萬人、蓋恐該地塞努賽幾落起事、故有此舉也、（字林報九月十九日　電）</p>

<h3>羅家倫夫人演講　自救與自贖</h3>
<p>勸國人慷慨救災　並望婦女界助賑</p>
<p>京訊、羅家倫夫人張誰楨女士、二十日在中央廣播電台演講、題為「自救與自贖」原詞如下、</p>
<p>「今年我國各地水災悄形的慘酷、和區域的廣闊、實已超過民國二十年、二十年主要的災區、不過揚子江、今年除揚子江外、黃河還四處奔突、遍地成災、綜合大小河流、泛濫成災的區域、多到十六省、災民人數、多到二千五百萬、湖北一帶、大部份都已陸沉、山東河南的大難未過、而蘇北的慘刧、却正一天嚴重一天、這兩個多月以來、我們蘇北的民衆、在政府領災之下、那種和水苦鬥的精神眞是使人感動、不過他們痛苦的努力、終究抵不住那洶奔的黃流、這幾天各報的消息傳來、更使人驚心動魄、一夜工夫、往往農田千傾、村鎭數十、盡被淹沒的、十五日邳縣秦縣長的電報說、全縣淹沒五十萬、災民老者投水、壯者對泣、婦女小孩結繩而溺、一字一淚、讀了沒有不酸鼻的、像這種慘酷的災情、就是他國遇到、我們也應當本着人類同情的大義、出力救濟、何况受災的都是和我們有休戚相關的同胞、我們豈能忍心坐視、我們要知道這些受苦的同胞、都是被剝削的勞苦民衆、我們在都市之中所享的豐衣足食、和榮華富貴、都是他們平時一點一滴的汗血所積成的、他們平時的生活、已經够苦、現在還遭着這種空前的浩劫、他們所有靠着活命的天地生財、多被淹沒、親愛的骨肉死了、連屍身都不能一見、自己挨餓挨凍、還得忍心看看衰年的老親和弱小的孩子活受罪、這些災民過的眞是人間的地獄生活、我深深的感覺、我們過優裕生活的人、為受災的同胞出一些錢、出一些力、也無非是替自己贖罪、</p>
<p>關於募捐救同胞、我以為第一要普遍、我們要使全國大多數的人民、各盡自己的力量、有錢的捐錢、有東西的捐東西、像最　政府規定軍隊中的士兵、每人出兩角錢的辦法、是很有意義的、我希望各級　校的學生、各業的工人、各商店的職員、以及在家庭裏的男女老小、大家聯合起來、就是每人捐幾個銅子、也能够得到　腋成裘的功效、希望各地及各大都市的居民、發起嚴密的組織、或是改良已有的組織、做普遍的募振運動、一方面可以救活許多同胞的生命、同時可以激發大家愛護同胞的同悄心、於團結民族情威、和啟發民族意識、都有很大的效力、</p>
<p>第二、我要奉勸有力量的人、快快的慷慨解囊、擔各處募振的經騐、大槪收入少生活比較困難的人、同悄心反而濃厚、我們若是留心這種新聞、我們隨時可以發現可歌可泣的材料、這當然是我們民族復興前途的一綫曙光、但是看到南北各大都會、這次籌振困難、不得不歸咎於多數巨富豪家的冷淡坐視、試看中國經濟中心的上海、竟然利用種種奇怪的方法來號召、而結果不過歸還墊欵五十萬、我們國民經液的艱難、固然是事實、但是根據穩健的估計、在現狀之中、祗要有財產有地位、收入豐裕、力能救人的人、一致發動援救同胞的熱心、則祇在幾個大都會裏、一二千萬的捐欽、是不難籌集的、中國農村同胞的悲慘生活、正是都會富裕階級的罪孽、現在他們躱在樹梢上、浮在水面上、求我們一點充飢的粗糧、和一些禦寒的奮衣、以維持父母辛苦養大的生命、我們豐衣足食的人、此時還不替自己贖罪還待什麼時候、我們要看清楚時勢在這個年頭、內憂外患、相迫得如此之緊、國家的生存、已經達到空前的難關、同時國際間的形勢、又是萬分險惡、私人的動產和不動產、都是靠不住的、與其日後不明不白的喪失、不如今日慷慨的捐出一部分、以救同胞的生命、救同胞就是救國家　救國家就是救自己、願大家激發天良、沒有捐過的盡力捐助、已經捐過的、如有一分餘力、仍請繼績輸將、最後、我要從婦女賑災會的立場、向本京和全國有衣穿有飯吃的女同胞、進一勸告、從大髒講來、這些被災的女同胞、是鄉村間能生產的人、而我們都市中、尤其是中上階級的婦女、大半都是消費者、我們舒服的生活和奢侈的享受、乃是過牛馬生活的農村姊妹們終年辛苦勤勞的代價、現在她們連牛馬生活都不能維持了我們難道不肯作小小的犧牲、我們可以把日常的生活費打個折扣、或是把娛樂酬應的欵項、分些出來、做母親的、還可以替子女提出一些糕餅錢、作為救濟災區小孩子的用途、這種辦法、還有敎育上的價值、慈愛是我們女性的天賦、我們應當本着愛護自己子女的精神、特別替災區中成千成萬待死的無辜兒童想想辦法、</p>
<p>救災要救急、被災同胞的生命、是等不得我們猶豫的、大家趕快起來罷、這是我們惟一自救的機會、也是我們惟一自贖的機會、」</p>
<h3>錢塘江　大橋工程近訊　大號打樁機船又到一艘</h3>
<p>杭訊、錢塘江橋自開工以來、工程狀况、曾誌報端、茲將其最近進展情形、撮要紀之如次、</p>
<p>（一）正橋部份、僑墩計十五座、位置均在江中、為全部工程中之最艱巨者、前由康益公司承包、興工以來、至本年五月間、靠北岸第一墩、及靠南岸第十四十五兩墩、均已築成鋼板樁圍堰、並分別在圍堰內建築沉箱及預備打基樁工作、第二號至第十三號橋墩沉箱、亦開始在南岸工場製造、詎因六月間、雨水過多、上游山洪暴發、橋址一帶水位激漲、江流甚速、汀底被刷深二丈餘、致將第十四十五兩號圍堰冲陷、江底鋼板樁、大半被流沙覆沒經設法打撈、因工作困難、尚未完全取出、至於靠北岸第一墩工事進行、尚屬順利、鋼筋混凝土墩墻、現已築成一節、壓氣機件及氣管等、亦經安裝完畢、現預備用壓氣法將在沉箱內挖土下沉、第二至第十三號橋墩之鋼筋混凝土沉箱、在上　南岸沉箱工場製造、業已造成三具、現正在建築臨時碼頭軌道伸出江面、準備用起重機將沉箱吊起、放入江中駛至各橋墩適當地點放下、然後再灌壓氣入內、挖土下沉、此項沉箱每具重六白餘噸、以之吊起駛放江中、實非易事、此種艱巨工程、在中國尚屬初次試辦、</p>
<p>（二）北岸引橋由東亞工程公司承包、該部份橋墩大小凡十座　形式不一、基礎深淺亦各有不同、故建築基礎方法、亦因之而異、有祗用開掘法、將基礎直接建築於岩石層上者、有須打木樁長自五十呎至九十呎始達石層者、又有用開口沉箱法挖土下沉五六十呎以達岩石層者、現均次第開工、有數墩已完正、預備上層鋼筋混凝土工作、亦有正在打樁挖土者、工作頗為緊張、</p>
<p>（三）南岸引橋由新亨營造廠承包、此部份工程、比北岸引橋基礎工作、較為繁難、橋墩雖五座、但地基不良、岩石層甚深、故須先打長至一百呎之木樁、始能建築基礎靠江岸兩座、因基礎甚深、挖掘不易、故須先打鋼板樁圍堰、又因地質係鐵板沙鋼板樁不易打入、現用射水機以助打樁工作、南岸一帶、打樁機·起重機·員工宿舍以及一切材料工具、星羅　布、與上游正橋沉箱工場遙遙相對、益以運料船隻麕集、江濱浙贛鐵路亦以此為尾閭、形成一積新工業區模樣、</p>
<p>（四）正橋鋼梁由道門朗公司承辦、現正在英國製造引橋鋼料、由西門子洋行承辦、在德國製造、其第一批均已在來華途中、</p>

<h3>專件　對於增加籌碼問題之意見</h3>
<p>工商業復興委員會工作方案，經第一次大會議決，先從調查統計訓練入手，並經積極推行在案，旋以各方對于籌碼枯竭一端，頗深關切，以為急則治標，對于此問題，亦有加以注意之必要，除由胡西園委員建議大意外，復由陳小蝶委員撰擬救窮策，主張發行公司債引換金融公債，以維危局，爰由第二次大會決議，組織小組會議，將該問題加以討論，目下討論稍具眉目，謹擬具意見書如次。</p>
<p>一　支付籌碼並不枯竭籌碼亦稱工具，金融市場之籌碼，分　二大類，一曰信用籌碼，即信用工具，為金融業授信之對象，證券票據等屬之，二曰支付籌碼，即支付工具，為最後清算債權債務之手段，硬幣紙幣屬之，目下一般人侈言籌碼，而忽于信用籌碼與支付籌碼之分，實則此中差殊，不可以道里計，蓋信用籌碼之增加，為「信用擴張」，而支付籌碼之增加，則為「通貨膨脹」也。</p>
<p>我國當前之困難，究為信用籌碼之消乏，抑為支付籌碼之枯竭，實為一重大問題，就表面以觀察，滬市存根，由去年五月終之五億九千萬元，降至目下之三億三千萬元喪失之數，達百分之四十五，支付籌碼減縮之形勢，不能謂為不嚴重，但自去歲十一月至目下為止，凡九閱月間，存銀並未繼續減少，則嚴重時期，似已過去，而此三億三千七百萬元之存銀，屬于華商者，仍達二億九千八百萬元之多，除發行鈔票分配六成現金準備計，尙綽有餘裕，則枯竭二字，似屬過言，同人等以為當前幣制之危機，一為幣值高昂所反映之物價跌落，二為人心不安所招致之資本逃亡，三為國際收支逆差所造成之脫離平價（Lisparit），而籌碼枯竭不與焉，其救濟之初版這，治本　須平衡國際收支，治標的須穩定幣值，近據財政當局發表談話，則　定幣值之方策，固已　縝密研究之中，吾人雅不欲旁加揣　，以亂視聽，惟就大勢以觀察，有可為國人告者，則無限制可　免之災難，揆諸人類進化之義，固決無樂于任其　演者，而貨幣旣為價值之尺度，其自身必須保持超于一般價值之地位，更為無可磨滅之至理，故　　皆幣之說，固不可行，力即是幣之議，亦屬虛幻，異　紛紜，徒使人心增其不安，局勢轉趨嚴重而已。（未完）</p>

<p>初級單打决賽</p>
<p>福勃司連勝兩盤</p>
<p>許德民在初級單打中、屢敗名將、已成惟一紅人兒、昨與福勃司爭奪冠軍、頗有十分把握、無如上場後小心太過、自殺多次、竟以四對六負第一盤、二盤開始、福切殺劈壓然是利害、許應付有方、比數初尚接近、入後求勝心切、幾記長抽、竟遭出界、結果又以四對六負第二盤、</p>
<p>許德民以顏色</p>
<p>第三盤為生死關頭、福勃司雄心勃勃、滿擬一鼓而下、詐德民固非弱者、小心翼翼、球來球去、神采斐然、精彩處竟使福勃司無從還手、以六對四馬上還以顏色、第四盤上場、許氏擬乘戰勝餘威、挽救危局、而福勃司球藝老練、態度鎮稍、連下數局、　氏灰心之餘、竟一蹶不振、以一對六失去第四盤、而以三對一被福勃司獲初級冠軍、成績如下、</p>
<p>公開雙打决賽</p>

<p>第三盤開始、老邱重振軍容、特孚亦報仇心急、史卡不甘示弱、且戰且守、迨第二局時、競爭之烈、　為以前所未有、卒以史卡應付得宜、德邱敗走、銳氣一挫、是盤冉告失守、第四盤邱特沉着應戰、施出平生絕技、往夾迎敵、卡遜屢施高壓、老邱還以死球、一往一來、竟不分勝負、相持有九局之多、德孚老邱、漸覺氣力不加、史卡猶能鼓其餘男、作殊死戰、老邱此時、筋疲力盡、不得不宣告屈伏、</p>
<p>今日秩序</p>

<p>銀角一鳴後、雙方排開陣勢、開始混戰、上海市隊聯絡靈活、二分鐘後、陳榮棠大顯身手、擲中兩球、黑鷹隊竭力迎戰、乃以聯絡生疎、竟至一蹶不振、陳聚才潘夢二人、乘虛進襲、黑鷹勢益不支、以二十五對五終局、上海市隊大勝、</p>
<p>下半時</p>
<p>檸檬時後、黑鷹報仇心切、銳氣重振、吳應華忙中得閒、連中二球、惟不時、即以犯規三次、宣告下野、楊筱璣上場補缺、此時上海隊益形活躍、潘小姐嬌小玲瓏、陳聚才身手嬌健、陳榮業獨居中路、紀錄速開、黑鷹招架難能、終以五十四對十、宣告慘敗、兩隊陣綫如下、</p>

<h3>小男兒（五二）</h3>
<p>— 美國奧爾珂德女士原著鄭曉滄（宗海）譯</p>
<p>不知道那個小烏兒把這個消息傳達到了總部，因此，當愛彌和唐恩像一對小獵狗鬬得正酣的時候，別的人面上也現出兇猛激動的神情，口裏還在吆喝，鼓動他們冉接冉厲，忽然裴先生走入圍場，以他有力的手將一對用武的人强曳開來，而以他們所不常聽到的聲音說道：</p>
<p>「我不許這涸的，孩子們。立刻停止；並且不要再讓我見到這個。我的學校是收孩子們的，不是收着野獸的，你戊且看看自己，也應覺得羞愧。」</p>
<p>「你放我，我再要把他打到地上去，」唐恩喊着，雖然有人捏住他的領子，他還是在掙扎過去。</p>
<p>「來罷，來罷，我還沒有被打倒！」愛彌也喊着，他雖然落地了五次，但他竟不知道什麼是失敗。</p>
<p>「他們是在傚效羅馬的角鬬武士，菲姨夫，」小橋高聲說道，他的眼睛因為那樁新鮮的玩意兒，張得異常地大。</p>
<p>「他們直是一群好畜生；但是我想我們總應比他們進步得多，我也不願你們把我的穀倉作為格鬬場。誰發起這件事的？」裴先生問道。</p>
<p>好幾個聲音回答道：『唐恩。』</p>
<p>『你不知道這是禁止的嗎？』</p>

<h3>不動的機器生銹不用的腦筋將如何</h3>
<p>— 玲</p>
<p>在我家近旁，有兩家小機作，他們織的是綢緞等，軋軋之聲，終日饗着。</p>
<p>有一天，我和弟妹們去參觀小機作，那地方很小，黑暗而沒有新鮮空氣，但地方雖小，機器有幾架，分人力機和電力機二種，那些工人，各人佔了一架人力機，手不斷的動着，脚不斷的踏着，很謹愼地織，電力機的旁邊只有一兩個人看着，但一天的成績，機器織的比人力織的多好幾倍。</p>
<p>後來我發現在黑暗而潮濕的角隅裏，有一架機器，呆呆地站在那裏，上面積了很厚的塵埃，沒有塵埃處，都呈了黃色，我便問他們道：「這架機器，你們為甚麼不用？」他們說：「因好久不用，已生了銹，現在不能用了。」我聽了偶然想起；「不動的機器生銹，不用的腦筋將如何？」</p>
<p>人類的腦筋，好似機器動的動停一般，腦子愈常用，思想愈進步，愈靈敏，能促進事業的成功，但是思想後，一定要休息，否則多用了，腦子要發生疾病，這便是機器工作的比喻，有的人們，以為用腦是麻煩的事，凡有了事，便沒有主意，於是他的腦，終於遲鈍退化了，這好似機器生了銹。小朋友們！你們要思想靈敏，進步，那麼要常用你們的腦去做事情，不久的將來，你的思想自然而然的會進步靈敏了。</p>
<h3>難道我們不如黑種人嗎？</h3>
<p>— 康健齋夫</p>
<p>我們中國有句古話，叫做「匹夫無罪，懷璧其罪。」自家有了寶貝，倘使沒有守護的力量，別人便由覬覦而來爭奪。有了錦繡河山，森林礦產，自己不會開發利用，別人就要來想念頭，弄花樣。目下意大利對於阿比西尼亞，便是這個勾當。</p>
<p>據黑衣宰相墨索里尼代表意大利國家公然向世界宣稱：我們要攻打阿國並不是存心破壞和平；實在是小願本國人民困死在貧瘠之區，要向外擴展殖民地，以伸張我們的生命綫。他說白人的國家，像葡萄牙，比利時，荷蘭等小國，尚且都有沃腴的殖民地，意大利何獨不能有！</p>
<p>至於阿比西尼亞，在意人看起來，根本沒有獨立國家的資格；根本不該享有國際平等的權利。因為他還是個愚蠢野蠻的黑種國家呢。這個觀念，不僅意大利人如此。白種人都是作如是觀的。英國人表面上是袒護阿國，其實是不願這一塊肥肉讓意國獨吞罷了。</p>
<p>弱肉强食，優勝劣敗，永遠是民族鬬爭史上的鐵律。黑種人能否保持這一塊虎口的肥肉，要看那些虎狼紛祭鬬爭的結果如何。就目前阿國的民氣而言，這種威武不屈，同仇敵愾，預備和强者拚一死戰的精神，是值得給那抱着不抵抗主義一味忍讓的老大民族做個當頭棒喝的。</p>
<p>小朋友們！難道我們不如黑種人嗎？</p>
<h3>東方的太陽</h3>
<p>— 鐵吾</p>
<p>太陽掛在東方，</p>
<p>好像小朋友的面龐：</p>
<p>圓滿輝煌，</p>
<p>趕走了黑暗，</p>
<p>放出光芒。</p>
<p>太陽掛在東方，</p>
<p>好像小朋友的面龐：</p>
<p>溫和向上，</p>
<p>努力的邁進，</p>
<p>前途無疆。</p>
<p>小朋友呀！</p>
<p>願你們將來的事業，</p>
<p>和旭日同樣的光芒；</p>
<p>祝你們現在的進步，</p>
<p>和旭日同樣的無疆；</p>
<p>人羣幸福，</p>
<p>國家榮光。</p>
<h3>愛兒童的歌德</h3>
<p>歌德是全世界聞名的大詩人，他在少年的時候，就很歡喜兒童。有一天的下午，他獨自在一個山村中閒游，這山村中有農家，倉庫，廣場，景緻很好。他隨興走到一個枝葉繁茂的菩提樹下，他看見那兒十分寥寂，衆人都到田野裏去了，只有一個年約四歲的　一個年約半歲的兒童在一起，大的一個坐在地上，把兩手托在立在他兩脚之間的幼者的胸部，他自己就好像　了一個安樂椅子一般，他黑色的眼瞳四處瞻望，眼神雖是活潑，他卻一動也不動的坐着。這景象使歌德很開心，他便坐在一隻相向的犂鋤上，十分愉快的描晝這兩個孩兒的姿勢，他把旁邊的籬柵，倉門，和幾個破車輪，加上，通同都依着遠近盡出，盡了一個鐘頭，他竟成就了一幅秩序井然甚有趣味的畫？……他在犂鋤上坐了有兩個鐘頭，傍晚的時候，那兩個小見的母親來了，他問悉她們的家境是不大寬裕的，他便給了孩子一些錢，繼和他們分手。</p>
<p>從此以後，小孩子們和他慣熟了，他常常拿糖給他們吃，或者拿些乳油麵包給他們吃，漸漸地那一村的見童們，都成為他親熱地小朋友了。</p>
<h3>軟硬功夫</h3>
<p>— 眞</p>
<p>敏見因讀書用功的緣故，所以他的父親便送給他一枝打鳥的獵槍。他得了那枝槍後，天天要想去試試自己的眼力，但是苦於沒有鳥的光臨。</p>
<p>一天，他在天井裏撒着好多的穀粒，在等候着機會。漸漸地，一隻貪嘴的烏來了，於是他瞄準了那隻烏，拍的一聲打過去。</p>
<p>那時他的心裏是說不出的快樂，但是那隻烏竟飛去了。這是什麼一回事？原來他正在瞄準它的時候，它已知道了，等到他拍的一聲，它早已飛到屋簷上去了。這時他又氣又惱。而他槍裏的子彈，打在那竹竿上在驪的棉被裏，於是他很着急的跑過去，因為他恐怕打穿了棉被，要受媽的責備，那知子彈却嵌在棉被裏，他覺得很是詫異，又很快樂的把那粒子彈拿出來，跑到書房裏去了。</p>
<p>「哥哥，我剛才在打烏，那知鳥倒打不到，而打在棉被裏，怎麼不能打穿棉被」？</p>
<p>「弟弟，你可知道俗語說：「一雙碗不響，兩雙碗叮噹。」的話嗎？這可以給我們一種好的格言，就知道無論什麼一件事雙方都有强硬的態度，才會發生衝突，如果一方硬一方軟，决不會發生。這子彈不能打穿棉被，也是這道理，那子彈從槍口放射出去，便有一種很强大的力量，這力量是從速度的快慢發生，如果速度减少，它的力量便也减少。它打着棉被因為棉被是鬆疏的，而有退讓的餘地，它受到槍彈的打來，便立刻往後一退，槍彈反受了它的阻力，速度因而减低，力量便也减少了，所以不能打穿棉被，如果只有一層薄薄棉花，那也要打穿的。譬如有一輛車在乾脆的路上，行動得很快，若陷在泥漿裏，便很困難的前進了，槍彈碰到棉花，很像這種情形」。</p>
<h3>拇指與動物</h3>
<p>— 冰玉</p>
<p>我們平常寫字，繪畫，取物，做工，完全是靠兩手手指活動的，倘若手指受傷，那末，各種動作，就很不方便了，這是自然界賦與我們最希奇的一副器械，可是人類以外的動物，也具有與我們的手相當的器械，譬如蟹與蝦的螯，烏類的足，爬虫類哺乳類的前足，都是與我們的手，有相當效用的，其中如猩猩猿猴的手指，與人類相同，就是有拇指食指中指無名指小指等五個，其拇指與其他四指相合，能捏能拿能拾能握，然而人類的手並非比猿類為靈敏，不過因頭腦作用，運用了兩手，隨意活動的，而且依腦的思想，發明種種文明利器，尤其是手指中的拇指，關係一切活動最大，倘若沒有拇指，那就减少效用了，哺乳類中的人猿，其拇指比其他四指，相距大短，所以各種動作，當然要减少能率，我們試看下圖，就可以明白拇指的有無長短，推知其動作如何了，如圖一為人類的拇指，指節最長，圖二為人猿，圖三為猩猩，圖四為雲猿，圖五為小猿，圖六為狐猿，圖七為熊，圖八為獅子圖九為猪，圖十為犀牛，圖十一為牛，圖十二為馬，自一至六，有拇指的，自七至十二是無拇指的。</p>
<h3>文章的疊羅漢</h3>
<p>— 杜也牧</p>
<p>兒童年開幕日，中國兒童文化恊會在滬西公社招待貧苦兒童。我那天也去參加的，當貧苦的小朋友們見到戲臺上在表演疊羅漢的時候，大家都拍手呌好，表示非常滿意。</p>
<p>小朋友們旣然很歡喜看戲臺上的疊羅漢，那末為什麼不喜歡看書本子上或報紙上的各種「兒童週刊」上的疊羅漢呢？</p>
<p>書本子上或是報紙上的各種「兒童週刊」上的疊羅漢，是類使我們要用另一種的眼的，這種眼並不生在我們的眉毛下面，却是生在我們的腦袋子裏面的。用了這種眼，才能使我們見到書本子上或其他一切之上的疊羅漢了。</p>
<p>一「篇」文章之成，是全靠「段」的，然而「段」之成却全靠「句」，「句」之成全靠「詞」，「詞」之成全靠「字」。</p>
<p>這裏我來把字，詞，句，段，篇，解釋一下</p>
<p>「字」……字就是一個一個的「單字」，例如：「兒」，「刊」，「週」，「童」。</p>
<p>「詞」……詞是表示一個的意思的，例如：「兒童」，我們就曉的是「孩子」，「週刊」，就曉得是每星期出版一次的一種刊物。——其實「兒童週刊」這四個「字」，就可說是一個「詞」了。字與詞的分別就在「字」不能表示出一個意思，如「刊」，你能在腦袋子裏想出什麼來嗎？因此，「詞」才能表示一個意思，如「兒童週刊。」</p>
<p>「句」……句是把單詞連結起來，能夠表示一個「完全的意思」。例如「兒童週刊」這個「詞」，雖然是一個「意思」，然而尚不完全。「兒童週刊怎末呢？」是啦，「我們讀兒童週刊」，加了「我們」，「讀」這兩個詞，才成為完全的意思了，這才是「句」。</p>
<p>「段」……段是被一個「中心意思」所統屬的許多句子而成的。「我讀兒童週刊怎末呢？」這句話究竟還不能說出你的完完全全的意思來的，所以必須由許多句子來講，不過這許多句子是完全統屬在一個「中心意思」裏的。</p>
<p>「篇」……有些文章可以一段講完，有些文章却須要許多段。篇就是總合段而成的。</p>
<p>小朋友們！這樣由「字」而「詞」，由「詞」而「句」，由「句」而「段」，由「段」而篇，一級一級疊上去，不也是疊羅漢嗎？這就呌做文章的疊羅漢。</p>
<h3>怪魚六種</h3>
<p>— 董遜</p>
<p>海洋裏向有許多種奇奇怪怪的生物生活着，尤其是魚類中有許多奇形怪狀的魚是江河湖沼中所沒有的。海中的魚類有的很兇猛，有的很美麗，有的身體很長大，有的力氣很大，能把小的船隻顚覆過來……眞是形形色色，設也說不完。</p>
<p>現在讓我來介紹海裏面六種奇怪的魚給小朋友認識認識：</p>
<p>（一）這種魚呌做彈塗魚（又名闌胡魚），它背上的第一個背鰭要比第二個背鰭來得高大些軟些，好像帆船上的帆一樣。平時它是棲息在鹹水和淡水混合的淺海，匍匐於海底的泥洞裏面。它在水中游得很快，並且很會跳躍的，它的肉甚美，可供食用。</p>
<p>（二）這是翻車魚，它的身體扁而高，差不多是卵圓形，體長五，六尺。嘴甚小；背鰭和臀鰭都很高，尾鰭如半月形，腹鰭是沒有的。皮膚很組糙，很像皮革。平時常游泳於海洋上層或中層。</p>
<p>（三）這種是印頭魚，身體長達二尺；頭部扁平，頭上面生着一個橢圓形的吸盤，吸盤中有二十多條橫的皺紋，常常用了它去吸在船底上或是別種魚類的身上以營生活。</p>
<p>（四）這種魚呌做旗魚，身體圓而長，背鰭和臀鰭都分為二起；它的上顎突出很長；全體有八九尺長；身體背上是靑藍巴，略帶淡黑色，腹部白銀色，肉味甚佳。</p>
<p>（五）這是方則魚，平時樓息在淺海的泥底裏面。身長一尺餘；背部的體色是紅的，腹部白色；　部很大，額骨隆起，略帶方形，所以呌它方頭魚。</p>
<p>（六）這種呌做鞋底魚，因為它的身體很像一隻鞋底的樣子，亦有人呌它牛舌魚，普通稱為箸鰨魚，身體扁平如舌狀，長約尺餘；奇鰭，皆連接；它的兩隻眼睛都生於身體左側的，體色左側黃色而帶黑色細點，被櫛齒鱗，有側綫三條，右側是淡白色，因此有人把它身體的左側當作背部，右側當作腹部的。</p>
<h3>猜字謎</h3>
<p>— （敬咸）</p>
<p>王兒和李兒是好朋友，署假裏，他們常在一起玩。一天，王兒對李兒道：「歌有一個字謎給你猜。」</p>
<p>李兒道：「好！你說，我來猜。」</p>
<p>王兒道：「够上不够下，够下不够上，上下併一塊，請你猜一猜。」</p>
<p>李兒想了好久，猜不出是什麼字。</p>
<p>王兒道：「這是「卡」字啊」</p>
<p>李兒道：「我也有一個字謎給你猜，」一隻沒角牛，三人騎着走」；這是什麼字」？</p>
<p>王兒想了一會道：「恐怕是「奉」字吧？」</p>
<p>李兒笑着道：「畢竟是你聰明，一猜就對了。」</p>
<h3>白山烏的故事（二）</h3>
<p>— 禧</p>
<p>我父親一時怒極，大聲說道：「我的家庭裏，决不是像這樣鳴的，幾百年來，我們從父親傳到見子，另有一種特殊的鳴聲，我每夜放聲一鳴，這裏第一層樓上，有一位老紳士，和頂樓中一位小工女，往往推開了他們的窗子，細細的側耳聽着。况且我眼瞧羞你這一聲可怕而可笑的毛羽，好像撒着白粉似的，有如戲班子裏的一個小丑，我難道還沒有够受了嗎？我倘不是一個最和平的山烏，那我早就撏光你這一身毛羽，好似一頭剛出窠的小雞一般。」</p>
<p>我見父親如此的不公道，也就怒呼起來了：「好！好！先生，旣是這樣，我也不必再和你住在一起了！我就離開你的面前，不再給你的眼睛再體見我這一身不幸的白羽，先生，我决計走了。我要飛開去；好在我的母親每年總有三次生孩子，以後定有好多的子女，可以安慰你的老年；從此我就遠遠地離開你去藏過我的憂恨，也許，」接着我又鳴咽道：「也許我在鄰家的後花園中或水落上找些蚯蚓或蜘蛛，借此維持我這可悲的生命。」</p>
<p>我父親聽了我這番話並不軟化，說道：「任你的便；讓我永永不要再瞧見你！你不是我的兒子；你也不是一頭山烏。」</p>
<p>「請問你，先生，那麼我是甚麼啊？」我問。</p>
<p>我父親勃然道：「我不知道，但你一定不是山烏。」</p>
<p>說完了這些刺人的話，他老人家慢慢地走了開去。我的母親憂鬱地飛了起來，回到伊的碗兒中哭泣去了。至於我呢，垂頭喪氣的苦痛巳極，沒命的飛開去，照着我先前對父親所說的話，一直飛到了鄰家的水落上。</p>

<h3>證券　公債多空均在掉期</h3>
<p>昨華商證券交易所、因係週六關係、市況平淡、市價極為呆滯、多空仍在極和平狀態下從容掉期、意阿消息、各報所載不同、顯有衝突、在此緊要關頭、有無轉機、三數日內、當有較為顯明之表示、羅斯氏行將到申、其舉措有利與否、固毫無把握、但市場人心、仍多作望梅止渴之想、九月份期貨祇餘下逾一二兩日、料亦無多大變動、九六投機、亦趨於沉寂、昨日經過、全日均在盤旋狀況下安全渡過、十六號空頭掉期、四十八號多頭掉期、交易較湧、但亦旗鼓相當、無甚參差、餘則十一及四十七號稍有賣出、五號及十四號稍有買進、供求亦頗有供給、市價第三度達十元零五角為最近高價、但仍回至四角收盤、一度波瀾、已告終局、昨日市價結果、一九開善各小五分、九六亦小五分、餘則一致回上一二角、惟本月編遺好三角半為獨多、成交總數、共計九百十七萬元、茲將其漲跌結果、比較列表於左、（單位元成交單位百元）</p>

<h3>紗花　本月紗多頭決意收貨</h3>
<p>紗市晨漲午跌、局勢又轉軟弱、但本月份市態獨挺、空方雖有交貨、然多頭方面、鑒於邇來現紗走銷活潑、存紗逐漸減縮、決意收貨、本月底交割量必巨、至於遠期形勢較萎、因青島日紗有貨過剩、來滬傾銷云、</p>
<p>遠期紗一致鬆落</p>
<p>標紗前市開盤、本月續漲六角、因多頭方面拉進一千包、檯面緊俏、遠月漲三四五角拍至二盤以後、本月份異常堅挺、結果本月比上日收盤價漲一元一角、遠漲二三四角、午後開盤、除本月份外、遠月一致疲乏、市氣殊形萎頓、據市場上言、外商拋出、現紗祇銷後轉澹泊、所以對於遠月看小、意阿局勢又見和緩、市盤步開步落、結果本月比上午收盤價跌一角、遠跌七八九角至一元、查賣出大孚四百五十包、通記五百五十包、賡豐九百包、大昌成三百五十包、同豐五百五十包、信誠七百五十包、錦昌九百包、仁豐六百五十包、泰昌五百十五包、恒昌六百五十包、買進大孚七百包、裕康六百包、仁豐一千二百包、長豐七百包、潤康七百包、振大六百五十包、慎昌八百包、長餘三百五十包、明華三百五十包、恒德三百五十包、一日間最高低價及收盤價如下、</p>

<p>棉市趨疲、因近來各路來源擁擠、銷路雖不間斷、然躉批交易殊感缺乏、有一部分紗廠、迄今仍未恢復工作、因此原料需用、仍覺過剩、惟外棉趨勢尙昂、故投機商吸收不放、</p>
<p>鄭標人氣軟化</p>
<p>標花前市開稩、近月雖跌三五磅音、印棉漲起一羅比半至三羅比七五、拍至二盤以後、聞大阪三品棉花跌六七角、各路到貨亦踴躍、人心仍屬平澹、結果各月比上日收盤價近跌二角至二角半、遠跌一角、午後開盤平平、無甚出和、形勢仍平澹無奇、現棉銷場不暢、結果近月比上午收盤價漲二千四百担、慎記一千七百担、仁豐一千三百担、泰昌一千担、新亨一千四百担、大豐二千担、明華一千一百担、長豐二千五百担、大昶一千七百担、買進長餘一千担、潤康四千五担、源興昌二千八百担、長和三千四百担、賡豐九百担、瑞大一千担、元一一千四百担、一日間最高低價及收盤價如下、</p>

<h3>美棉套賣甚力</h3>
<p>昨美棉開盤、因利物浦消息良好、國外政治情形不定、外商同業及經紀商買進、各月猛漲十磅音、其後套賣增加、利物浦多頭一部份了結、麥市及股市不利、價乃回軟、旋以十月期多頭了結均為廠商吸收、再度回好、卒以套賣甚力、仍形不振、結果現貨跌五磅音、期貨跌三至六磅音、現銷較活、日有脫手、紡織需要較廣、本週銷售、據估可與生產量相等、海斯德氏估計本週廠用為一五一、〇〇〇包、利物浦存底為一二〇、〇〇〇包、英棉現貨漲十二點、期貨漲跌一至三點、印棉初因日商投機家略有賣出而疲、後因期貨商大批買進而漲、計平果爾漲一·七五羅比、原電錄左、（二十日電）</p>

<h3>糧食　標粉浮多紛紛了結</h3>
<p>昨日粉市、因洋麥報價、芝加哥落四分至　角零、坎拿大跌一角六分、市場人心、本以國際空氣為轉移、今則洋麥轉軟、投機多頭之期望、彷彿意冷心灰、故近期開價即落一分、遠期初祇小一分、旋以市場浮多紛紛了結、致又跌二分之譜、迨下午開盤、本月份又跌、最低至五角二分、後因廠方未出、意英之爭執、未能認為樂觀、故散戶多頭、又起而活動、較之初開、回上二分左右、但較之前日收價、仍跌一二分不等、列表如下、</p>

<h3>期麥僅一二分上落</h3>
<p>昨期麥市面、上下午開盤、各月份大致轉平、因洋麥報價、落四分至一一角不等、業內外之投機交易、已無利用之根據、故月份喊價、均少興奮、至目下市場上之觀察、國內之存底如何、消費如何、均無注意、一跌一漲、純以國際空氣為爭執之目標、全日上落、不過一二分、實覺平靜之至、</p>

<p>婦女園地</p>
<h3>東西南北</h3>
<p>— 雅菲</p>
<p>東鄰日本，數月來鬧得轟轟烈烈的選舉肅正運動，聞將以本月二十二日的「婦女日」，為最後一次的宣傳。這天，萬於「選舉肅正婦人聯合會」的三十五個團體，將召集婦女十萬，作盛大的示威游行；她們對一般家庭婦女和有選舉權的男性，擬定如下的標語：</p>
<p>一，選舉沒有　妾的品行方正的人。</p>
<p>一，選舉切實關心婦女和兒童的人。</p>
<p>一，丈夫若作弊而被捕，妻子將受相異。</p>
<p>一，準備可口的早美，激勱丈夫選舉賢良的人。</p>
<p>在西方，各國婦女代表正在日內瓦參加女子地位的辯論會，代表中國的顏女士（顏惠慶，侄女），她的演說中有：</p>
<p>「希望西方男子，以俠義的態度與女子以合法的權利，而不道迫女子，使她們向男子奪取平等。」</p>
<p>危急萬分的阿比西尼亞國，婦女卻在和男子一樣積極地備戰；有的慷慨從軍，有的捐助糧食，有的組織救護隊。</p>
<p>北方的蘇俄，婦女正在推行她們的新使命，她們的軍事訓練一天加緊一天，投入陸軍和空軍的人數一天天增多。不久之前，莫斯科的眞理報：「我們決不可忘肥蘇我婦女巳接受她們的權利，同時也已接受她們的許多義務；她們的求學和工作像男子一樣，她們也有和男子一樣的尚武精神。」</p>
<p>至於南方，南方且說我們自己；目前各地都舉行取締婦女的奇裝異服，試看大晚報的廣州通訊：</p>
<p>「穿奇裝異服的太太戊佔十分之六七，……有車階級的太太，……車　滾滾，翩然而逝，…等到香車停了下來，旁邊卻有高視闊步的老爺或其他，呌你不敢下步。」</p>
<p>世界各地的婦女生活，由上述的幾端，大致可以概見。所有的資本帝國主義國家，婦女是一色地仍然鎖在沒有普遍獲得參政權，立法權的狀况之下。施行新主義的蘇俄，婦女無論那一方面都和男子平行。至於半殖民地的婦女，則有兩種方式：一種是反抗的鬥爭的如阿比西尼亞的婦女所為；一種是腐化的苟安的如中國婦女所為。中國婦女，除上舉的奇裝異服的驕奢的有車太太而外，由我們被外人剝削盡了的國情，不用說也可知還有和道正反對的無衣可穿的婦女羣。在殖民地上重新做「人」的唯一要素是鬥爭空氣，這空氣打進了阿比西尼亞高原卻不給打進我國；比較起來，在東西南北的人類中，我們似乎是最甘居下流的一羣。</p>
<h3>鮮花憔悴在逆旅</h3>
<p>— 茜</p>
<p>——在某大旅店中的見聞錄——</p>
<p>前天，因為訪友，晚問十時走進了西藏路的一家大旅舍。友人的房間在二樓，正對準着中間的大花樓。花樓兩旁是天井，樓中則擺滿了懶板凳似的長沙發，一只沙發上，兩個穿白綢短掛褲，胸前吊着金表帶的，四十多歲的大腹賢在打盹。看那鼾睡模樣，像煞十年也不會醒來似的。</p>
<p>這時大門外兩個一回，一個一回地慢慢走進了許多摩登少奶奶和少姐模樣的人物。他們的裝束，全是把身子裹得帮緊而痛身曲線畢露的長旗袍，但誰的手里都提一個錢包，而錢包的種類以白色細珠穿成的居多。他們走上樓來，好像足踏故地，又像初次來找人似的一個一個慢吞吞地扭轉着細腰，擺動着大臀，脚下行行欲止，止止欲行地在地氈上盪來盪去，同時一對秋波像剛出洞的老鼠使勁向四周打量着。</p>
<p>有好幾對上三樓去了。在我一會沒留意之中，長沙發上的兩位大腹質早已精神百倍一人懷里擁了一個美女在喃喃悄話。不久，由三樓走下的一個黑衣女郎，也被兩位大腹買呌住了。黑衣女坐在沙發的正中，結局，兩僑大腹賈不但各人一邊抱一個美女，而且另一邊的一隻手又在向黑衣女進攻。坐於左邊的大腹賈，右腿壓在黑衣女的左腿上，坐於有邊的大腹買，左手不斷地捻着黑衣女的面和臂，兩個胖豬的臉都笑成了和合一般：可是黑衣女只溫馴地將一對眼空漢地死釘着地而，像正在被宰割的羊羔，坐在左右的一女郎也只有默默然拿眼各望一旁。</p>
<p>我看了這種情形，心中很是憤懣，但我的朋友却滿不在乎地說：「這算什麼，這些全是跑旅館的娼妓，她們的整個生活才苦呢！」以下，全是朋友給我的說明。</p>
<p>「這個旅舍幾乎是專為上海的商人，公務人員，以及薪俸生活者們嫖賭尋娛樂的地方。妓女們兩個兩個一道來的，還是長三么二之流，一個人單獨來的，才是專跑旅館名呌淌白的。來兩個的，其中只有一個是出差的，另一個是一面相伴，一面做監督工夫。由旅館茶房呌來的妓女，她戊所得的酬金與茶房對半分，但酬金整部每夜沒有超過十五元的。這對半分來的七八元，妓女也不能全得，她們所得的數目，按她們的性質而有區別。一般娼做生意大的分兩種，一是做「包「的，一是做「拆」的。做「包」的妓女，是被押在　婆，或妓院的姑娘，押金按姑娘的　顏興身材而定，但至多沒有超過五百元的。押的年限是三年或五年。在這三年五之中，姑娘的一切收入全歸妓院的主人，而主人得供給姑娘的衣飾鞋襪等。姑娘生意好，主人會另眼相看，衣飾鞋襪時常換新，但姑娘自己的零用，還是要由慷慨的客人給點外快。生意不好的姑娘，不但主人不替她買衣飾鞋襪，並還要做組專，打雜燒飯等全要幹，有時更要挨打。</p>
<p>做「拆」的妓女，是隸屬於一些自己錢不多，打不出碼頭（買不通流氓）來的鴇婆或少妓院的姑娘，因而便要附帶在旁人的妓院里做生意。這種姑娘來的七八元錢，又須與所隸得屬的妓院作四六或對半分，很衣飾鞋襪等妓院可不負實，而這對半分來的三四元錢。也得全部歸第一次的主人所有，自己一文無分。所以妓女們實是被鐵練子捆着在那兒專做剝削者們的生利工具。普通說做娼妓，便是　入火坑，一點也沒有誇張。」</p>
<p>午夜十二點我走出旅舍的門，門外坐電燈包車而來的妓女，大有潰堤後的流水一般，不勝海湧之勢。「這種屠宰場，何時方可消滅？」我問！</p>

<h3>回家（續）</h3>
<p>— 蘇虹</p>
<p>（七）</p>
<p>嫂嫂開大着櫉門，急燥地說</p>
<p>—哪！你們看，那有鹽！</p>
<p>買官鹽的差使們東看看，西搗搗，翻出來的是霉乾菜，是灰塵，還有剛生下的紅肉老鼠</p>
<p>—那末我們到別家去搜杳。」差使們走後，滿屋子一片零亂。</p>
<p>嫂嫂整理了好半天，打算燒晚飯，菜上却沒一點鹽，她臉朝着石階瞪望了許久，决定給孩子喂好奶去借貸。不料她剛至立福叔的門口，立福叔却在打老婆；他拿了一支樹根不，恨恨地鼓：「打死你，娘的，打死…」他非常苦惱，租了五畝田，用了老大心力種，也配化了不少肥田粉，禾有剛剛有點粗壯，就給太陽晒死，只有後板頭的一畝二分田，有點水吸，雖不給太陽晒死，却被蝗虫吃光。他常常肚子裏默想：「誰會相信哩，我是種田的，倒在買米吃。」印子錢又借了不少，旣沒有米可以賣，又要納錢糧，年關已到，出入賬目不能淸。官鹽太貴，一槐只有三斤，盛在籃底中只有一點點；偷偷地買了一塊錢私鹽，這十斤鹽打算吃到明年夏季，却被買官鹽的差使搜了去，不但鹽沒收，在外還拿出了二塊錢罰金。「打死你，娘的！」他愈打愈起勁，腿肚上的靑脈打了結。老婆又愛好看，她常常私下裏積此錢化在洋貨船，牢固耐用的土布不喜歡，偏要買那些花花綠綠的，洗了幾次就會破的洋布。新式的假金戒指也會買，假珠子串成的耳環也會買。立福叔更恨，一起都塞住他心頭。「燒過，一把火燒，索性都燒過。」他咒罵着憤概地把樹根子擲到地上，着自己的頭坐到屋角裏，好像在哭似的。</p>
<p>嫂嫂知道借鹽不是時候，就吊起嗓子解勸：</p>
<p>——實在的，他們太……。我不向他們買，他們說：你不買官鹽，一定是買足了私鹽。」……立福嬸，別哭，立福叔總會　做，像我們，他們的爹……」</p>
<p>挨過了晚餐，孩子們都睡着了，嫂嫂一邊在油燈盞底下補衣服，一邊細細地想：「如果丈夫不回來，等過了年，就趕到上海去我尋；小的孩子帶在身，大的兩僑留婆婆照管。」她並想到，如果丈夫找不到，那末就把小孩子送到育嬰堂，去做娘姨，或是巷人家縫衣。對於修珍，很不滿意老在家，常常想對婆婆講，叫她許配了男人，家裏既少一個人吃，又可以得到幾十塊錢騁金。她放下針，一個個地看過孩子，給他們蓋好被，携了燈盞到母親的房裏。</p>
<p>母親在念佛，修珍已經入睡。嫂嫂把計劃好的生活策略告訴了一番。</p>
<p>——這樣也好，孩子我總會管，你妹妹也會帮忙。」母親說。</p>
<p>——說起，妹妹的事，昨天梅林太娘帶便對我說過，（她不由得造起謊來）要給妹妹做媒……。我是捨不得妹妹的，她在這裏可以帮不少的忙。」嫂嫂嘴裏雖這樣說，內心裏却在計劃：大孩子大啦，拾柴的事，可以交給大兒子。「如果我到外邊做事，我想把我住的房間租給人家，一年也有二三塊錢可收。」她又補充了一樁計劃。</p>
<p>母親剛要說出媳婦的主意打得很對，聽到問壁立福家的開窗聲，以及許多講話聲，她換了語調說：「什麼事？」</p>
<p>嫂嫂走到窗前，推開一看，王少奶奶也探出了頭，太公的幾個媳婦也探出了頭。</p>
<p>——啊呀！起火！」嫂嫂望着前面的屋背那槐地方，只見紅紅的。</p>
<p>西北風猛一陣吹來，窗門自動的關緊，碰着嫂嫂的臉。她又把牠推開，把住，連聲地問：「是不是起火，立福嬸？」</p>
<p>——是强盜，剛剛立福拿了洋槍去集保衛團了。」</p>
<p>王少奶奶連連把窗關上說「阿菊！快點把大門壓住，石頭，石頭……。」</p>
<p>母親全身發抖：「啊彌陀佛—快點關上窗！肉你起來，穿穿衣。」她忙脚忙手的把紡花車放在床後，把茶壺藏在床頭上。</p>
<p>——急倒不必急的。我們這樣窮，誰不知道。一定是搶忠貴少爺的家。」嫂嫂雖這樣說。兩脚却速步地跑回自己的房裏。看三個孩子。</p>
<p>——啊彌陀佛，保佑他們不給搶去……。」母親想到念佛的主顧。</p>

<p>（問）某甲於十二歲時因叔父母相繼亡去無後遂由甲繼承甲現年四十三歲無子女甲之本身母及同母弟妹均健在請問甲身後之私人財產及繼承叔父所得之產業是否皆歸甲妻一人承繼或其本身母兄妹亦得分承否（王固）</p>
<p>（答）據本件悄形將來繼承開始時，應由甲妻繼承遺產之全部。（律師濮舜卿）</p>
<p>（問）我今年二十一歲，在今春結婚，是父母之命，媒妁之言。（訂婚時未得本人同意）現在我發覺與對方意見相左，勢難偕老。未知可以離婚嗎？</p>
<p>如對方不同意離婚，法律上可有什麼補救辦法？</p>
<p>如我提出離婚，我可要賠償他們的損失費，還是他們要給我籍養費，（隱憐）</p>
<p>（答）意見不合，除兩願離婚外，不足為訴請離婚之理由；在兩願離婚中，有無贍養與賠償，得由協議定之，訴請離婚，必須合民法第一千零五十二條所列情形之一。因判决離婚而受有損害之一方得向他方請求賠償，無過失之一方因判决離婚而陷於生活困難者，他方縱無過失，亦應給與相當之贍養費用。（律師濮舜卿）</p>
<p>（問）敝人未出生以前，即被家父强與舅父之子證婚，生後仍就養于我家。迨十七歲時，始正式結婚，因敝人不滿意此種結合，且對于染有花柳病，婚後即被傳染，故治愈後即離夫家就學，在外八年，從未通問，而所用各費，亦未取用對方一文。且敝人在他家時，彼巳納一妾，平日亦不務正業，且有雅片嗜好，現敝人已决定與之離婚，未審在法律上有充分根據否？（易衛）</p>
<p>（答）本件悄形倘非對方惡意遺棄在繼續狀態中者，訴請離婚於法未有充分根據，納妾固足為離婚之理由，但已因時效而消滅。如出雙方協議離婚，則無不可。（律師濮舜卿）</p>

<h3>第二節　參政問題</h3>
<p>— 君慧</p>
<p>所謂參政問題，乃是婦女在政治七要獲得與男子同等權利的問題。我們知道，在封建社會雖也有過掌握大據的女皇，及其他富有政治天才的貴族婦女。但這是持殊的，至於大多數婦女，則絕對與政治無緣，正和農奴一樣無過問政治的資格！可是，自從近代市民階級以民主主義的武器！擊破專制王國的時候，便由他們提出這個問題。換句話說，婦女參政問題就是布爾喬亞民主主義的產物。</p>
<p>關於這問題的發生原因，已在前節中論及，在此，祇就其勝史的發展過程加以簡單的叙述。在歷史上看來，參政運動最先發生的是法國，在一七八九年法國大革命時代，豪傑和羅蘭夫人發表女權宣言書，主張男女在政治上平等，這是婦女參政運動的嘴矢，可是，到了拿破崙一世時代，制定所謂拿破崙法典，這法典，不單否定了婦女的參政運動，反而把女子放在男子的奴隸的地立。一直到了一八三六年的七月革命及一八四八年的二月革命，婦女的參政問題再被提出。聖西門，傳立葉等空想的社會主義者極力的提唱男女平權。自從一八七一年拿破崙第三失敗，共和政府復興以後，參政運動的團體，像如雨後春笋般的產生出來，但至今仍只是僅得到地方自治團體議員的選舉權。所以婦女參政運動雖發源於法國，但法國婦女至今還沒得到正式的參政權。</p>
<p>其次，英國的婦女參政運動，開始於一八一九年以後，牠是受了瓦爾斯登格拉夫特女士的女權擁護論的影響，一八三二年選舉法改正前，和一八四〇年穀物條例以及奴隸反對的二大社會運動等促進了女子底覺悟，她們深深的感到政治的興味，從此以後，不但婦女方面組織各種政治團體，而且自由黨及保守黨也組織婦女參政團體。例如婦女參政權協會，國民聯合會，和婦女社會及政治聯合會等為其中最有力的婦女團體，前者是溫和派，要靠立憲主義達到成功的，後者是激烈一派，其運動常常逸出常軌，故又稱武斷的參政運動派。但是她們的運動，在大戰以前，得不到何等效果，在大戰以後因為婦女在大戰中，在置事及經濟上的貢獻甚多，一般的男子對婦女的態度與前不同，所以婦女參政權法案，終於在一九一八年十月二日在下院以二百七十四票對廿五稟通過</p>
<p>美國婦女的參政運動發生狠早，一七八三年美國獨立戰爭的時候，婦女也和男子一樣，對國家有所貢獻，因此，在一七八七年，憲法會議的時候，婦女們要求市民選舉權，這就是美國婦女的參政運動的開始，其後一八三〇年到一八〇四年的十年間，為奴隸解放運動的時代，這時，婦女大受刺戟，組織婦女參政運動團體。但她們的活動，也到大戰後才得成功。</p>
<p>除以上三國外，其他國家，亦次第的承認婦女參政權，但在此因篇幅開係，不能詳述，祗好舉出各國承認婦女參政權的年代表如下；</p>
<p>如上表所示，大多數的國家，都是在大職以後才承認婦女的參政權利，但無論那一個國家，對婦女參政權，沒有像蘇聯的婦女那樣澈底和廣泛！這絕不是偶然的！因為資本主義社會的參政權，在表面上是民主主義，但在實際上，有種種經濟的及社會的限制，沒有錢的人，根本沒有在政治般臺上活動的餘地。尤其，世界政治進入於法西斯階段以後，所謂德模克拉四的假面，盡被暴露，一世紀以來，鬥爭得來的參政權，為幾個英雄的獨裁者們所奪去！到現在，參政問題已經過去了，</p>

<h3>我們需要怎樣的拼音文字</h3>
<p>— 壽振球</p>
<p>中國文字今後的趨向必然是拼音化，這是母庸懷疑的。所以現在的問題是在於我們需要怎樣的拼音文字，換言之，我們目前需要的拼音文字應該具備那幾個條件。據我看來，這種將被採用的拼音文字至少要滿足下述的三個條件：—</p>
<p>一，簡易合用這種文字首先要簡易合用，這才能為文盲大衆所接受。書法規則要簡單。廢除一切不必要的煩難和累贅，像漢字的四聲之類。但除這種簡易之外，又要合用，足以表達一切的思想和感情。所以所謂簡易，乃是指掃除一切無謂的繁複，使得大家學來方便，而並非簡陋。這種文字要在學來簡易的範圍內力求表現的精密，這才能適合於一切方面的應用。</p>
<p>二，國際化這種文字要徹底婦除象形文字的遺留，適應語文國際化的必然趨勢，要有意織地促進中國語文的國際化。業已國際化的術語，以及必要的國際化的文體，要有計劃地輸入進來。因此，它的字母必然要採用拉丁字母，因為拉丁字母是頂國際化的字母。</p>
<p>三，口語化　這種拼音文字决不是把漢字——不管是文言或白話——的翻譯，而是把活人嘴里的說話拿來書面化。要使得文字和語言一致起來，一方面使文字易學易懂，同時也使它更活潑豐富起來。這種文字要打破語文間的墻壁，使讀出來就聽得懂，說得出的也就寫得出來。為輔合口語起見，自然還要實行詞見的連寫。</p>
<p>中國文字拼音化的最初的嘗試，遠在十九世紀的末葉。雅片戰爭之後，來華的外國敎士最先創造了各地土白羅馬字。這種敎會羅馬字運動，不但是因為他們的動機在於麻醉人民而成為一種沒有前途的運動，同時他們的土白羅馬字也不過為了傳敎的方便而創造的工具，最初就沒有取漢字而代之的企圖的。一八九二年盧戇章，一八九五年吳稚暉，一九〇〇年王照，一九一一年勞乃宣，也都各各創製過各種　音字母——切音新字，豆芽字母，官話字母，簡字。這些字母有的採自漢字的部首，有的更受了日本「假名」的影饗，有得脫胎於篆字，但是它們有一個共同的缺點，就是不國際化，更不便於詞見的連寫。</p>
<p>民國二年北京舉行讀音統一會，擬定字母時引起了各派字母的粉爭，結果才抬出敎育部事前决定暫時應用的一副字母來通過了。這副字母便是「注音字母」，現在改稱「注音符號」了。注音字母依舊是漢字的邊旁，而且寫不快（中國似乎只有黎錦熙先生能寫注音字母的草體），不便於詞見連寫。製定的當時原為了統一漢字的讀音，後來發覺它不配稱「字母」而改稱「符號」也就是這個意思。</p>
<p>民國十二年國語統一會推舉了，一個「國語羅馬字委員會」，從事於國語羅馬字的擬定。這個委員會到了十四年才着手工作，六七位委員忙了一年，至十五年才完成了。民國十七年蔡元培主持大學院時，才由大學院正式公佈了。這種國語羅馬字和從來的字母不同，它採用的是拉丁字母，所以在形式上是國際化的，這是它超過過去各種字母的地方。但是它的書寫法式，因為保留四聲的緣故，變得異常複雜難學。因此自公佈以來六七年中，依然無人使用，據他們自己說，也要一千年，五百年或一百年之後才能成功呢。</p>
<p>最近出現的中國話寫法拉丁化，在廢除漢字採用國際化的拉丁字母這一點上，是和國語羅馬字共通的地方。但是拉丁化不要四聲，口音也不以北平一地的土話為標準，所以極容易學習。在詞見連寫方面，拉丁化有着較合理的而旦系統整然的書寫規則。此外，拉丁化主張的「以口頭話為準」這一點更是它的特色，也因此很巧妙地解决了四聲問題，這是國語羅馬字所不及的地方。</p>
<p>綜觀上述，能恰好滿足拼音文字的三個條件的，目前只有拉丁化。</p>

<h3>評「桃花扇」</h3>
<p>— 紀旬</p>
<p>不是我給別人作義務廣告，「桃花扇」却是一部很好的影片。</p>
<p>意識是很前進的。整個說來，牠是反封建，反一切壓追，而領人走上革命的道路P全劇約事實自然是以北伐前後為背景，但，我們如果睜大眼睛，也許看得出這樣的時代並沒有過去：目前對建勢力還施逞着殘暴，人壓迫人的悲劇依然在各處重演着，正需要歷史的事實給壓迫者一種新的提酸和指示，而「桃花扇」就是對着這一點來的。</p>
<p>在個人方面說，作為全劇中心人物之一的方與民，那種不屈眼於惡勢力，不受金錢的誘惑，而依然努力的向前衝去，確是革命者應有的態度。女主角謝素芳，因處境的惡劣，受挾制於篾片市儈，仰慕光明，反抗惡勢力，也是必然的。在這消沉的時代中，正是需要着這種勇敢的覺悟的人物來刺激退後的，迷惑的男女啊！</p>
<p>然而最使我滿意的，還是全劇的結構和技巧。牠沒有冗長和不連貫的場面，沒有勉强穿挿的事實，劇情的發展是很自然的。</p>
<p>劇作者撮取普通的事實，位置幾個普通的人物串演，使人看着畫面彷彿回憶到往事，視着人物的活動覺得是自己和朋友的經歷。這種眞實而普通的典型描畫，比之特殊的虛構更能使人感動。如像丘八鬧後台，想看女戲子，這無論在過去，現在或在華北，南國，都是常事，然而這種「常事」正足以暴露軍閥軍隊的橫蠻和殘暴。</p>
<p>劇中沒有英雄好漢，作為主角的方與民也不過是一個智識階級的份子，他需要娛樂，需要戀愛，正同常人一樣。謝素芳不滿意於自己的環境，頗思反抗，遇着方與民這樣有志氣的靑年，羨慕和追逐也是人們的常情。我們如果到容子裏對妓女眞實一點，她是要向你訴說一切痛苦而向你表示好感的。又譬如孫道誠算是劇中的反角，但看來並不令人怎樣討厭，他之壞也是由環境促成，劇作者這種輕描淡寫是很合情理的。總之劇作者對於人物的身份的處理都很得當，比之其他的影片要高明得多了！</p>
<p>關於演員的演技，我最贊成金燄和胡萍，他們一舉一動都很自然，純熟，就是一些小小玩笑也表演得很有趣味而生動，並不使人感覺無聊。尤其是胡萍對於女戲子的身份揣摹得很熟練，她沒有羞縮的態度；沒有小姐的習氣，然而她却是活潑，大方，並非下流，一顰一笑都覺可愛。其次如顧夢鶴，王次龍，也都很稱職。章志直摹仿山東×州的土音很相像，再加上他那種肥胖的身體和粗暴的動作，便更像當年北洋軍閥的張××了。</p>
<p>演員的對白已經免除了演說式的姿態，這對於劇情的眞實增加了不少的力量，尤其是胡萍，國語說得很純熟，兼之又是女人的聲帶，說來特別淸晰。凡是諸國語的人，都可以完全種得的。</p>
<p>不過全劇中也有小小缺點，如像方與民同謝素芳新婚那一晚在洞房中被吳鮮發說穿了秘密時，不必馬上當衆生氣而責問孫道誠，很可以將其喊入另外的屋子裏慢慢質問他，這樣繼不顯得很忽忙。臨別謝家時，情景也不大緊張，而親友中竟沒有一人前來勸解，未免有些表現得不充分。還有方與民組織別動隊時，人數太少，民衆的情緒和力量都沒有什麼表示。這些都不能不說是導演者疏忽的地方。</p>
<p>然而「桃花扇」終不失為一部傑出的影片。自然，這張片子算不得頂苦的悲劇，每場都幾乎有點趣味，但戲劇總是含有娛樂的意味的，祇要牠能激發你的情緒，使你的生活向上，都有牠的藝術價值。</p>

<h3>在英意爭鬥中的法蘭西</h3>
<p>— 房元麟</p>
<p>意阿衝突的發展很快地就成為了英意地直接爭鬥的局面。起初是英國以調人自居，手執國際聯盟，主張將問題移到日內瓦來解决；意大利則抱着强硬的態度，根本反對第三者干涉東菲事件，認為意阿問題乃意阿兩國間的問題，應由兩國直接解决。隨後英國態度亦轉强硬，同時法國又出來調解，使莫索里尼不得不放棄其拒絕第三者干涉的主張。於是，巴黎的三國會議，日內瓦的國聯大會，羅馬方面都特派代表參加，討論東菲問題。然而，在另一方面意軍仍在繼續開往東菲，其海軍　　地中海出大　活動，最近更集中大軍於意屬利比亞地方以威脅埃及；對此英國則以大批海軍在地中海操演相對抗，並封鎖直布羅陀海峽或蘇彝士運河以威脅意大利。這樣一來，從東菲經過地中海直到歐洲大陸，都佈滿了可怕的戰爭空氣。這中間的直接衝突者當然是意大利與英國。</p>
<p>在英意衝突日益尖銳中，最值得注意的是法蘭西的態度。假使法英聯合，挾國聯以制意大利，則羅馬必陷於孤立，莫索里尼亦不敢單獨在東菲在地中海上去腎險；反之，倘若法人助意以抗英，則英國也就不易單獨去制裁意大利了，歐洲形勢也必因此而發生更犬的變化。所以，我們可以說在英意衝突中法國實佔着舉足輕重的重要地位。</p>
<p>本來自上次大戰以後，英國為要抑制法國在歐洲的覇權，向來是行的揚德抑法政策。法國在此情形之下，當然不得不另尋友軍，以資對抗，於是法俄協定，法意協定先後成立，以此法國才能引蘇聯和意大利來制德抗英。東菲問題發生後，法國政治家均不表示具體態度，以默許意大利在東菲自由行動，便是法人企圖助意抗英的眞體表現。觀乎意大利在共軍事準備中將國內大軍集中於意奧邊境，而在意法接連地帶則毫無防備，更可見到莫梭里尼的行動是在暗中得到了法人相當的諒解的。但是，為什麼法國不出來公然帮助意大利，反而高唱「和平」以作調人呢？這是因為法國有兩個極大的顧慮。其一是恐東菲戰爭爆發後德國乘機進取奥大利，並進兵出波羅地海，以攻法俄；自意阿衝突發生後，希特勒直到現在尚未發一言，只是努力擴張其軍備，這情形更是使法國不安，不敢坐視事件的自然發展。另一則是法國內部的政治危機已到了極點，萬一戰爭爆發，內部發生問題，那法郎王國的命運也就很難說了。所以，法國雖欲助意抗英，但在表面上却也不得不一面結好於意大利，一面向英國暗送秋波，採取兩面和好政策。</p>
<p>法國一向所求者是集體安全制度，以圖制止德國勢力的向外發展。過去因為德國的反對，英國態度的冷淡，所謂集體安全制度始綫未能實現，這是法人所極惑不史的。現在英意衝突旣日趨嚴重，而法國在這中間又佔着極重要的地位，老好巨滑的大不列顛帝國為要拉攏法人，便企圖以贊助集體保安制度來換取其參加共同與意的陣線。於是，英外相赫爾便在日內瓦一面聲明尊重國聯盟約，一面更表示英國「擁護集體制保障和平」。果然，法國一聽到「集體保安制」的主張，便覺得非常高興，頓伐爾即刻宣稱：「英外相赫爾之言論乃英國絕無保留歸入集體保安制之步驟，以是法國人士對於此種言論之滿意亦倍勝於任何其他各國，蓋英法此種一步一趨，共負國聯責任之精神，實為歷史上一新時代出現之象徵也」。但是，法國也並不簡單，賴伐爾也不因為赫爾一言就完全贊助英人而棄絕意大利，觀其在國聯會演說的全部內容，便可知道法國的態度究竟如　了，很顯然的，頓氏雖然　面表示法國擁護國聯，並稱赫爾之贊助「集體保安制」的表示為「歷史上一新時代出現之象徵」，但在另一方面他也並未忘記拉緊意國，繼續向羅馬親善。他在稱贊赫爾的言論後接着就說：「本年一月七日所成立之法意協定非僅為保持法意利益之協定，對於世界和平尤具重要性，自此協定告成後，法國巳竭其一切以求對意邦交之增進。」「即以現時之意阿爭端論，法國亦處處採取妥協之態度，惟此問題之解决雖極困難，然欲求一旣足以滿足意大利欲望，又足以保持另一國聯會員國主權之解决辦法，尚非絕無希望。」由此可知法國在日內瓦的態度仍是八面玲瓏向各方要好的表現，只不過是在其中特別透露出了法人因為希望「集體保安制之實現，而相當地表示了巴黎與倫敦較前接近罷了。</p>
<p>然而，就是賴伐爾這樣的表示也生了很大的影饗。如蘇聯與小協約國和葡萄牙等國之繼起聲明擁護國聯，都可增加日內瓦的聲勢。同時，羅馬方面聽到頓伐爾的演說後即表示失望，一般報紙對賴氏的言論頗多抨擊，甚至稱其為「狂吠」；只是墨索里尼因為外交關係，雖然也有點不大滿意賴氏之言論，却也不得不又緊牙關說：「賴伐爾演說中涉及羅馬法意協定及意法友誼之語，則內閣仍與以友意之歡迎，意國志在與法國敦睦邦交，此不僅有利於法意兩國，且有利於歐洲之合作，以法意友誼之敦篤，斷不致因殖民地爭執而破裂。」這樣，以圖抓緊法國。現在，特委會報告畫已擬就，意國巳表示不能接受，至於如何答覆，則意阿兩國都正在研究中。同時，英法正在暗中交涉，英國所企圖者當然是要法人贊助其對意的實際干涉，法國則希望英人與之共同努力，實現「集體保安制」，要挾倫教明白表示阻止德國侵奧，保障中歐和平。但實際上要英國完全　絕德國和波蘭，而帮助法俄完成「集體保安制」，負責保障中歐和平，却是很成問題，同樣，要法國完全站在英國方面對付意大利，那也是法人所不願意的；再加以德國波蘭之拚命反對「集體保安制」，意大利之認制裁為宣戰表示，那更是使問題難於解决。自然，就目前形勢看來，如果英法獲得了—時的「諒解」，以「集體保安制」與「一致對意」相交換，那也未始沒有些許可能消除戰爭於一時。不過，就意大利的實情及其所行的政策看來，戰爭的可能性依然很大。意大利在東菲事件中巳耗去二十萬萬里拉（約英鎊三三五〇萬），墨索里尼早巳表示其在東菲的行動非同兒戲，其勢已到了非戰不可的程度。假使不幸意阿一旦開火，牽動歐洲，那時法國便不得不放棄其遊離猶豫的態度而要在意英間選擇誰是友軍或敵人了；同時，法蘭西的命運的决定者恐怕亦將不是賴伐爾和赫里歐睹人了。</p>
<p>職業婦女的自由</p>
<h3>女嚮導員</h3>
<p>— 許燕儀女士談</p>
<p>我第一次作事是在南京一家百貨商店，不用說是當女店員；但這在當時的南京却是一椿惹人驚異的女子職業呢？記得我在南京商業學校讀書時，除了下汗在街上見到幾位在政府機關裏做事的女職員之外，別的塲合就不大看到有女</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>人在對裏活動。這種情形一直維持到二年後發在學校畢業時仍舊沒有改變：但不久，人們的畏怯心理像是漸漸消退，許多範圍較大的商店也都開始　用女職員了。</p>
<p>店裏對於我們的待遇，似乎比男職員要好一點：每月薪水二十四元，供給伙食；每半年加薪一次，三元五元不等，視成續優劣而定。至於工作時間，也和一般的商店差不多，每天從上午八時至下午八時半，足有十二時半的工作。</p>
<p>我進店的第一天，許多男同事便都帶着疑問的眼光，注意着我的行動，似乎想在我身上發現一點我不能做女店員的缺點。然而，這種觀念他們好像是失敗了似的，等我能够像他們一樣的工作了幾天之後，大家却都對我換了一副面目而親近起來；有時當我要在很高的架子上拿東西，他們便都爭先恐後的替我幫忙搶着上去拿了。我看着這種情形很覺好笑，但我却不領受他們的盛情，而仍是要我自己上去拿下來；於是，他們便又會像失了什麼似的，睜着失望的眼睛望着我發呆了。</p>
<p>在那裏工作了半年之後，由於我個性的堅强，一般男同事對我的態度也漸漸由疑問，親切，而變換到仇視了。這原因很簡單，就是因為我沒有做到像他們心目中的所謂「花瓶」；但他們究竟是聰明的，因為我不願做「花瓶」，而他們倒會反轉來說我是店裏雇用來給大衆欣賞的一隻「花瓶」呢。</p>
<p>「日媽兒，呼盆（卽花瓶）！」這種南京音的粗鄙咀咒常會有意的鑽進我的耳朵裏來。你想同他們交涉麼？但他們並沒指定是罵誰的。</p>
<p>好了，在那裏生活了半年，每月收入雖不够養家，但我總算多得了一點做人的經騐！我離開那裏時是在去年冬天，照商業上的習慣來說，這正是生涯應該鼎盛的時期，但那裏知道事實恰是相反：南京雖是一塊冠蓋雲集的地方，却也免不掉不景氣的襲擊；一般大小商店，要想支持那將要塌陷下去的局面，便不得不實行「裁員减薪」政策，而我們店裏的許多男職員也就在這不景氣的情形之下相繼回去了。女職員因為祇有兩個，裁掉了恐太露痕跡；因此我和另外的一位女同事總算在保持對外的觀瞻（？）上沒有發生動搖。但裁員雖沒有臨到我的身上，可是减薪却也免不了；我的月薪本來是有二十四元，後來一减就去掉了六元。這在我確是一椿極大的損失，，所以我在那裏繼續工作了一月之後，便不假思索地告退出來了。</p>
<p>我們一家來到上海的時候，正是鼓樂喧天的廢曆新年；人們都瘋狂似的在找尋快樂，我却守着一個生活的暗影在家裏發愁。這樣，直到今年七月才看到報上有一條招請「女嚮導員」的廣告，——當然也還看到別的廣告，不過都是空跑了一趟回來——限定的資格也並不過高，我於是决定去碰一碰命運。</p>
<p>在考試的這天，男女擠滿了一個屋子，大槪有二三百人的權樣；彼此雖都不認識，但生活門爭的情緒却正是相同的。試題分筆試與口試兩種，筆試很簡軍，所以大家都不費勁的繳了卷；口試却比較麻煩，有許多人竟不等終場便先自走了。主試的是廣東人，可是說得一口很好的各地方言；他對着每個應考的人，一會兒操着北平話問幾句，一會兒又用湖南話問幾句；如果應試的能很快的對答出來，便有錄取的希望。口試的試題，除了以方言做中心而外，多半以本埠的路名做題材。例如他問：「西門在什麼地方？」你就得很快地說出來，並且還要知道怎樣乘車子才可以到達。</p>
<p>那種口試看去好像很簡單的，然而結果卻祇攷取了十二個人，我因為曾在上海生活了七年，所以以一個廣東人也還能說幾句不生硬的上海話；從七歲以後便到了南京，說南京話自然又不成問題；至於北平話，那是從前在學校裏早就學會了的。那天我去應玫，便全虧佔了這點便宜，所以沒有落選。</p>
<p>到這裏來工作還祇有三個星期，前送的好壞也說不上，不過這種職業的新奇，却使我感到極大的興趣。這裏的同事共有二十多個人，其中女「嚮導員」十二人，男的十人；彼此因了職務關係不常在一塊，所以便沒有像在南京做店員時代那種環境。社裏對我的待遇也沒有什麼岐視；男女工作時間，都一律從上午九時起至下午十二時止。伙食由社供給，月薪取佣金制；嚮導費每小時計洋七角五分，我們可以從這裏面得到十分之西的回佣，車費包括在內。</p>
<p>這樣每月究有好多收入，目前當然沒有方法統計，不過拿我上半月的進欵做標準，大槪每月可有四十多元的收入。這在現今的女子職業中間，當然要算是較好的一種，但沒有這多收入的「嚮導員」也還不在少數。</p>
<p>這社的主旨和我們服務的範圍是在替下列幾種人作嚮導：（一）凡初到上海欲遊覽上海市區及附近各地名勝者（二）凡舟車道經上海有若干時間逗留欲訪友或購物而苦無領導者，（三）凡久居上海厭市塵之煩囂戚獨行之寂寞欲作郊外小遊以娛心目者。」我在這社裏服務還只有三個禮拜，以我這一點點經驗所得，覺得現在一般要找我們嚮導的，還是住在上海的人佔多數，這是不能隱諱的事實。因為這種事業在中國還是一個「初生子，」一般人都帶着好奇心想來嘗試一下、，而且這事業的實行，又是由女子打頭陣；在認為女子是「玩物」的心理還沒有根本消除的現在，這種嚮導事業之可以發達一時是可以預卜的。也因為這個緣故，有許多人為我躭心，他們以為女子做「嚮導」是有許多的不便，若不是有勇氣（？）的女子，决不敢幹這種職業的。這些論調，我不敢說他戊不是有識之見而想加以反駁；但我總覺得「事在人為，」人要使事業的聲譽墮落，那是沒有方法可以禁止的。譬如我們服務範圍的第三項規定：「凡久居上海厭市塵之煩囂，感獨行之寂寞，欲作郊外小遊，以娛心目者，請電知本社，當即派員前來嚮導，」這很顯明的是陪伴人家到郊外旅行，使人家的身心愉快；試問這種行爲與醫院的女看護盡心看護一個患病者的意義，又有什麽分別？我對於現職業的觀念是這樣，所以我就認為牠是一種正當的職業。</p>
<p>常識</p>
<h3>內蒙古的礦產</h3>
<p>— 周樂山</p>
<p>（一）煤炭</p>
<p>民國二三年版「中國經濟年鑑」戰，丙蒙古的煤產額，察哈爾一一四。五零零噸（民國二十年），綏遠九一·二零零噸（同上），寗夏不詳；前二者合計起來，共二零五·七零零噸，不過河北省的四十分之一。察哈爾的煤炭，埋藏量五零。四零零萬噸，以宣化，蔚縣，懊來，張北等縣為主要產地。內蒙煤礦多係民營，官營事業則只於民國八年在張北砂壩附近經營試辦煤礦。但該礦成續不佳，產額少，銷路狹，加以地方事故頻仍，已於數年前停止業務。該礦面積約達一二·二八八公畝，淺礦巳經掘完，深礦則因技術關係不能採掘。</p>
<p>察哈爾所產煤炭，一部運於平津，但為數極徵，大部分還是充當省內消費。</p>
<p>其次再一瞥綏遠。大靑山一帶的山間溪谷中散佈着許多小煤礦。其炭層含有侏羅紀系的砂層，層數為七，厚一尺至九尺。前山一帶，地殼變動甚劇，炭層成直立形，炭質各地不同。察素齊以北產的煤炭係碎末狀的無烟炭，薩拉齊以北的巴圖溝起，到包頭以北的大西溝的地方產的，全係適於製造軟煤的有烟煤，年額約一五萬噸。大靑山煤田的西部產和大同煤田所出的同質瀝青煤（有烟煤），那兒係水平層，所以便於開採。而綏遠省目下採掘中的煤礦，大小亦共有四十一所。規模最大者是面陽縣石拐溝的煤礦。該煤礦距包頭東北方約六十里，礦區面積約六零方里，以產上等有烟煤著名。炭層係三層，每層間挾有五十尺乃至二百尺的炭石層。第一層厚三尺至五尺，第二層七，八尺，第三層四尺乃至十尺。採掘係用原始的士俗法，所以深部水量多處便不能開採以致放棄。本礦區的埋藏量約七，八千萬噸，除有烟煤外，無烟煤亦多少產出。</p>
<p>現在採掘中的煤礦全係原始的，由普通山璧炭層露出的地方，隨着層的方向，開以大礦道。大礦道的高約四——五尺，寬五——六尺，由此進而左右採掘，以雜木作支柱為出煤的礦道。採掘出來的大塊煤炭，便以礦夫肩運，粉末則以天秤及槙壳搬運。採掘量，一日平均三人可掘二噸餘，大礦約有百餘名的礦夫，一日約掘五，六零噸。礦夫數十名乃至數名的小規模的也很不少。因為規模小，採掘的方法又是原始的，所以通風排水的設備都沒有，因此不能深　。因而為了要達到煤田的豐富區域，就不得不中途而棄別求礦道的事也常常有之。礦區之大者約估六——七零公畝。</p>
<p>在運輸方面，專靠馱載，因為交通機關缺乏，也常常不得不眼睜睜的把良礦放棄。由煤礦到平原的距離，珠兒溝一零里，大西溝一五里，萬家溝四零里，水澗溝三零里，巴圖溝二五里，五當溝及石拐溝（至包頭）各六零里。如石拐礦在包頭東北方六十餘里的地方，運輸則全靠大車牛馬，所以由石拐到包頭往復三天，運費一噸達五——六元。在　區煤炭原價一噸二元乃至六元，假設運费二元，則至包頭後原價需八元，所以現在大靑山的煤不能和大同煤競爭。</p>
<p>（二）鹽</p>
<p>蒙古高原中散佈着許多沒有流出口的湖沼，而天氣又極其乾燥，蒸發力頗强，所以湖水鹽分也很强。由內蒙古至新疆方面產岩鹽極富，尤其是靑海產出特別多，且又不課鹽稅。</p>
<p>內蒙諸地的主要鹽湖有：甲，察哈爾北部—達里泊（周四十哩），大布蘇諾爾（周四十哩），古爾板諾爾，及此外西烏珠穆沁。乙，察哈爾中部—大布蘇麻黛諾爾（周一哩），此湖位於東蘇呢特旗，被覆以數尺厚的鹽層。此地尚有若干的鹽湖。丙，察哈爾南部—太海及壺盧湖，周圍五十多哩，含有濃度的鹽分。丁，鄂爾多斯地方—大冶海子長徑約八哩，短徑約〇·五里至二哩，其東部有豐富鹽層。此外同地方的杭錦旗及那托克旗也有數鹽湖。戊，阿拉善東部—吉蘭泰鹽池和察拉臺鹽池，是中國西北部最著名的鹽湖。後者周約二三哩，有二尺乃至六尺厚的美麗的鹽層覆於湖面，狀頗偉觀。</p>
<p>由以下所述的察哈爾北部的大布蘇諾爾湖的蒙鹽出產狀况，即可知蒙鹽在古時是地方交易的重要商品。大布蘇諾爾產鹽量多，平均每年約可出二五萬担左右，且鹽質也良好。大布蘇諾爾在錫林郭勒鹽的西烏珠穆沁及東浩濟特兩旗的交界處，距西烏珠穆沁旗王府西北一二〇粁。湖為東西長，南北短的橢圓形的漏斗狀，長徑約一〇籽，短徑約四籽，周約十六籽。以里計之，整一〇〇里，故又名百里湖。隔湖岸數粁，四方圍繞着丘陵。鹽湖的水深約二尺，東部及南部有幾分淺瀨。湖內有許多地方是圓形的凹處，其深則因大小而不同，直徑一五——一〇米，內部有直徑二尺許的鹽噴出孔，不絕的湧出含有鹽分的泥水。泥水結晶，便在周圍形成鹽層。鹽在湖底成白色的沉澱結晶，且在水中漂着的枯草七面也浮着雪白，像開着由花似的美麗。鹽水湧出的原因，其說很多，大概是在湖底有深的岩鹽層，泉水湧出時將此鹽層溶化而含有之。湖底的土質是暗靑色的粘土，所以即使把滿載着鹽的牛車拉進去也不至陷入。</p>
<p>鹽湖的南方及東方，有牛馬往來的採鹽道通入湖心。又在湖甫約距二籽的西烏珠穆沁，東浩齊特兩旗有徵稅所衙門。在衙門的周圍散佈着採鹽夫所居住的包約二十個。大布蘇諾爾湖係西烏珠穆沁及東浩齊特兩旗所共有，兩旗旗民得自由採鹽，但他旗民要採鹽，則課之以稅。旗民對於此湖視若神聖，禁止漢人走近湖畔。採鹽者除上述兩旗旗民外，以克什克騰及巴林兩旗的蒙人居多。每年四月至九月為採鹽期，他們採鹽的器具，食料及天幕等都以牛馬積載而來。多時達百數十名。採鹽方法極簡單，散鹽用箥箕盛取，塊鹽則用鍫碎之。牛車一輛的載重量為三—四〇〇斤，此外則用駱駝及驢馬　子。駱駝馱子約可載車三〇〇斤，驢馱子約七〇斤。</p>
<p>這鹽湖是兩旗旗民的天惠，而且湖內又有許多深處，所以當採鹽時非雇傭此兩旗旗民之專屬採鹽夫不可。每當七八月之交，採鹽最盛期，兩旗各達一百名左右的採鹽夫，其工作時之情狀頗悠暢。一日採鹽量多者五，六車，如降爾多時，則僅不過採二三車而已。</p>
<p>（四）其他的礦產</p>
<p>內蒙古的天然資源中，和岩鹽同樣重要的便是鹼。鹼在察哈爾的察哈爾盟正籃旗的賽風諾爾（多倫諾爾附近），同正白旗的大察罕，大達岡，白諺諾爾，什路諾爾，和圖特諾爾，同廂白旗的伊呿諾爾，在綏遠的伊克昭盟鄂托克旗，杭錦旗及和林格勒縣產之。鹼多由鹽湖變成的，即因降雨而溶解地中的鹼分，不久隨着水分的蒸發，湖邊便殘留着白色的鹼結晶。埋藏量極豐富，鹼的產出區域僅綏遠便有一·七五〇方里，鄂托克旗有東西二湖，湖底都結晶，厚及一尺，年額察哈爾約七·九五〇噸，綏遠一八〇〇噸）前者產出的鹹多由張家口輸入中國內部，後者多以綏遠省一帶為消費地。在</p>

<p>張家口交貨，一噸約六元。</p>
<p>在察哈爾及綏遠兩省，鐵埋藏量頗豐富，察哈爾鐵的埋藏量的比較的確實者四五·六四五·〇〇〇噸，其也的，古計有四六·〇〇〇·〇〇〇噸，合計九一·六四五·〇〇〇噸，居中國各省中的第一位；綏遠的埋藏量約八五·〇〇〇·〇〇〇噸。察哈爾的鐵鑛脈，由宣化縣烟簡山始，集中龍關縣辛窰，龐家堡一帶，此地的採掘權歸官商合辦龍烟鐵鑛公司（資本金五〇〇萬元）所獨占，該公司為了採掘的緣故，特由平綏鐵路宣化驛敷設專用鐵道，又在河北省石景山（在北平之西）設有煉鐵工場。綏遠的武川，鄂　，固陽，薩拉齊，淸水河，包頭等地也產鐵，據說固陽縣有七〇萬噸，武川縣白雲山一·〇〇〇萬噸的鑛脈。但因製鍊仍沿用舊法的緣故，年產僅有一〇〇噸。</p>
<p>其次，察哈爾宣化縣王家樓，胡壯子附近年產硫黃一·八〇〇斤，約值三〇〇元，為硫酸火藥，肥料製紙等使用。綏遠的固陽武川兩縣的大靑山侏羅紀炭層中也產硫黃，但產額不明。</p>
<p>石棉，察哈爾也產，但產狀不明。綏遠則為主產地。武川，薩拉齊，固陽，包頭，歸綏，安北諸縣及設治局，察哈爾右翼部，烏蘭察布盟東公旗，烏拉特部，伊克昭盟諸旗及察素齊一帶均產之。只大靑山方面的埋藏量就有六八萬噸。榮豐公司及公盡棧駐包頭分棧都在各地經營礦坑，但年產額極少，僅二〇噸內外而巳。</p>
<p>他如銻，綏遠的鄂托克旗產之；磁土，固陽，淸水河兩縣產之（年產額二·〇〇〇噸）；石墨，歸綏及興和兩縣產之；寶石，華麗石，水晶等，陶林，固陽，興和諸縣及察哈爾各地多產之，但採掘狀况及年產額等均不明。</p>

<h3>數學的現實性</h3>
<p>— 于城</p>
<p>數學，這在自然科學中要算最抽象的科學，因為他所研究的對象只是物質世界之量的關係。然而事實非常顯明，能够為我們直接威覺的東西都是質量的統一結合物，刮去了質而單有着量，便成為不能見不能聽不能觸只能想像的東西，儘管它仍是客觀現實之一側面的事物。因為如此，所以數學便成為最抽象的知識，它不過是對於實在的質之量的關聯性的抽象研究而已。正因為數學的這種特殊性，遂使一般槪念論的學者們認為數學只是先騐的思維公式，是思維的邏輯形式的科學，沒有它的客觀現實性，也不受任何客觀現實的反映而自發於主觀的思維中。寗可說是先天的永存邏輯形式，或者是宇宙精神的邏輯形式為人類所領悟而生的。所以康德派的數學家把數學的公理當作先騐的，先經騐而存在的，就是笛卡兒和萊普尼茨那樣偉大的數學家也認為數學的公理是與生俱來，不憑經騐與現實的反映卽有的。</p>
<p>可是，若以新的科學的觀點看來，數學儘管是很抽象的科學，但仍產生於客觀的現實世界之中，人類對於這種量的關係之邏輯形式的構成，乃是客觀的現實世界的量的邏輯形式的反映，並不是先天地來自自我的靈魂或宇宙的靈魂之中。自然，這種數的槪念和邏輯形式，在一經被人類抽象出來獲得了某些基本的一般的法則以後，人類往往不再利用現實物質自身的量的事實以為比較，而獨立發展了，甚至倒轉來用這種邏輯去發現自然自身的量的關係和其法則，如像近代科學依於數學的計算而測知原子的種類和序列以製成原子表，依數學的計算而測知原子，電子，量子的大小，發展了物理學，依數學的計算而促使天文學，化學，乃至經濟學進步等等那樣。但無論如何，第一，數學的概念與其法則總是客觀世界的現實事物之量的法則，並且在最初獲得這些槪念與法則時，還是從具有質量之統一的實體物中比較出來的。野蠻人只能數到二十個數，因為他只有二十個足趾手指，他亦必須搬着指頭才能數數，便是數的槪念之客觀的根源的實例。第二　人類在由初步的抽象獲得了最基本的數學法則之後，縱然可以運用思維更抽象地去發展這些法則，離開實在物質之量的邏輯形式的此較，製出很多的算式公理來，然而這些東西仍要依存於現實的物質之量的關係，才是正確的和合於適用的，要能倒轉來適用於自然，解釋自然，才能成為數學的公式公理。我們之所以能根據數學原理，反轉來去處理自然事物，也正因為它是具有此種客觀的現實性，是與自然之量的法則相契合的。</p>
<p>這裏我們且拋開理論不談，來根據事實加以說明罷。用許多單一的量總和起來的加法，從一總和的量中减去許多單一的量的减法，乃至依於一定倍數而乘積的乘法，這在自然的物質世界是最最現實的東西。一排三十個人之中新招來了五個新兵，或逃跑了五個兵士，這是實體物之量的總和之增减的變化，數　家固然可以用加减法去處理它，就是小孩子，他雖不懂數學的加减法，也可以用他的直接的現實感覺興原先的經騐去認識這種變化，因為這是現實事態自己顯出了它的量的法則的緣故。原子，分子集合着若干單一的電子，原子成為目己的總體，原子亦放射出若干單一的電子减少其原有的質量，這是物質自身在進行現實的加减。原子依其自己的序數之二倍而構成它的重量，鐵原子以下的原子約略地依氦原子的四的若干倍形成它們的原子量，這又是自然物質在那裏作現賞的乘法了。假使你要問一切幾何的形這種數學的槪念是如何來的，那麼我們將回答這是許多現實物質之若干規則與不規則的空間形態的反映。因為水晶體自己就會構成各種有規則的結晶的幾何形體，蜜蜂能盲月地服從自然法則製造正六面形底巢。直綫　不須假定其為理想的點毫不彎曲地運動的結果，可是任何物體如果不在全宇宙中受着別的諾物體之引力與拒力的影饗和牽攝，則其運動確都能劃出一條很直的綫。光底行徑照新物理學考察起來，它是能彎曲的，但也只是在通過由別的物體所形成得有空間曲率的區域時，如像通過太陽附近那樣，它才彎曲其行徑的。砲彈依於地心引力的作用自然地劃成了拋物曲綫，行星依於它和太陽之相互間的引力與拒力作用，也自然他劃成了橢圓形。實在的直角三板與矩形板，只要依於三角形之勾股的任何一邊興矩形的任何一邊旋轉，卽能劃成一個圓錐體和圓柱體形出來。這都不需幾何學家在腦子裏為它們製造，才能得出各種各樣幾何形式，不是很明白的嗎？</p>
<p>在一切計算的公式裏，在數學的邏輯形式中產生出來了，在現實世界裏也可以找得出來。比如正負二數之合，其得數常常是兩數之差，而其得數之性質為正為負，則係依此二數之較大的一個來决定。這種量的關係，在現實事物中到處都可以尋得出。在力學上，方向反的大小二力共同作用於一物體，則物體的運動常常是向着較大的力之着力方向走，而該物體所受之力和因此而生的效果則常相當於二力之差，就是一個例證。又如在原子構造中，原子是屬於正電性或負電性的，它完全依屬於陽核與電子問所負電量之較强的方而，而其極性電能之强度亦决定於其相差之量。由此可知不待數學家想出上述的算式時，自然界已早在那裏照此算式工作了。</p>
<p>總之，數學並不是數學家腦子裏預存的邏輯形式，數和形的槪念「是完全從外界獲得的，……數的對象是現實世界的空間形式及數量關係，所以是非常現實的資科。」它是「從現實世界抽象出來的法則，在某種發展階段上是離開現實世界而成為某種獨立物，成為世界要受它規定的一種外來法則，和現實世界相對立的。」但「純粹數學無論如何是後來才適用於世界的，它原是從這世界獲得的東西，只不過是構成世界的關聯形式之一部，也因為如此它才能適用於世界。」沒有現實世界之量的邏輯形式就沒有數學，不能符合於現實世界之量的邏輯，因而不能反轉來去處理自然的量時，這也不成其為數學。</p>
<h3>介紹郭步陶近著「共通原則論」</h3>
<p>—定價二角，新聞報館發行—</p>
<p>在國際戰雲瀰漫的今日各國的作家們大半在書報上發表着悲觀的，消極的論調。同時也有一部分作家為世界和平，用積極的態度，激發着世人的反戰悄緒。可是在我國，這一類為世界和平的積極的著作却還很少見。新聞報的時論記者郭步陶君所著的「共通原則論」可以說是屬於這一種性質的。這部小畫充溢着人道主義的熱悄，就挽回世界「殺機」的方法，作心理上的檢討。作者以為人類社會有着千古不移的幾種共通原則。只要人人對於這些原則有澈底的認識，就可以實現世界和平。他分「生存權」「人生的意義」和「責任」三部分來解釋所謂共通原則。雖然所說似乎寬泛，但是給予讀者的槪念却十分明確。我們可以說這部小書是世界和平的正確的指南。處在現代的我們，如果自覺着對於世界和平有應盡的天職罷，就不能錯過這部書。</p>
<p>專述</p>
<h3>華僑在全世界（十二）</h3>
<p>— 鍾民誼</p>
<p>南美</p>
<p>華僑在南美者比在中美的還要多。其在英屬圭亞那者有數千人，在智利者有三千人，在巴西者有二萬人，在秘魯者，有四五萬人，—其最多時期，竟有十萬人之多。其中以工人為最多，商人次之。近年來，除巴西對待華僑尚好外，其餘南美諸國對我僑胞都盡最排斥。</p>
<p>西印度羣島</p>
<p>四印度羣島，總共有二十餘個為嶼，其西面之大島各古巴，是我們常在新聞紙上見到的較有名的一個國家。在一八八七年有華工五萬餘名輸送來此，隨後更增至十一萬四千餘人之多。他們都備受虐待，其遭遇有如黑奴，所以到古巴去的華工不久就死亡了大半。一八九八年美西戰爭後，古巴成為美之保護國，於是才實行禁止華工入境。但直到而今，在古巴華僑尚有十萬人左右，其中以勞動者和小商人居多。</p>
<p>除古已外，在西印度羣島的千里達和牙買加亦各有華僑數千人，在法屬馬爾地尼克島和荷屬庫拉薩俄等地亦各有少數華僑，他們呵說都是經商或做工的。</p>

<h3>Song Zheyuan Takes Office as Commander of the Beiping-Tianjin Garrison</h3>
<p>Song Expresses Four Points of Sentiment to the Press; Inspects Feng Zhi'an's Troops Stationed at Xiyuan Tomorrow; Wang Shuchang Leaves Baoding for Hankou</p>
<p>(Beiping) Song Zheyuan, the commander of the Beiping-Tianjin Garrison, took office at 11:00 this morning in the headquarters' auditorium. Over 300 people attended the ceremony, including Bao Wenxue, Shang Zhen, Yuan Liang, Zhu Ruilin, and representatives from various sectors. After the ceremony, Song delivered a speech, stating that he was appointed by the central government to defend Beiping and Tianjin, but he felt inadequate and feared failure. Beiping and Tianjin are cultural centers and important national strongholds, and he hoped for guidance from all sectors. He has always believed in Chinese morality and opposed the Communist Party and will continue to uphold his principles to maintain social order. Since Beiping and Tianjin are home to both Chinese and foreigners, he will uphold the central government's intentions to foster good relations with neighboring countries. Afterwards, Bao Wenxue, Shang Zhen, and representatives from the Chamber of Commerce delivered speeches. After taking office, Song met with reporters and expressed four points of sentiment: (1) He hoped that the troops and police responsible for local security would continue their efforts to maintain order; (2) He hoped for guidance from all sectors, especially candid suggestions from the press, to avoid mistakes; (3) He will strive to implement the central government's policy of friendly relations with neighboring countries; (4) He is willing to do his best to fulfill the expectations of all sectors. After taking office, Song also posted a notice of his inauguration. Song is scheduled to inspect Feng Zhi'an's troops at Xiyuan on the morning of the 23rd and visit foreign envoys on the afternoon of the 23rd. After the headquarters is organized, he will return to Tianjin to visit foreign diplomats and then go to inspect the areas of Chahar. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) According to a telephone report from Baoding, Wang Shuchang, the newly appointed Deputy Chief of the Military Senate, arrived in Baoding early on the 21st and visited Wan Fulin, the commander of the 53rd Army. After staying for a day, he will head south to Hankou to meet with Zhang. The troops of the 53rd Army stationed in the Beiping-Tianjin area were transferred when Wang Shuchang was the commander of the Beiping-Tianjin Garrison, and they are now directly under the jurisdiction of the 53rd Army. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Song Zheyuan took office as the Commander of the Beiping-Tianjin Garrison at 11:00 AM on the 21st. Shang Zhen, Bao Wenxue, Qin Dechun, Yuan Gen, Xiao Zhenying, and representatives from all sectors, as well as all staff members of the Garrison Headquarters and officers of the 29th Army, totaling over 300 people, attended the ceremony. After the music was played and the ceremony was conducted, Song received the seal and addressed the entire staff. He stated that he was entrusted by the central government with the responsibility of defending Beiping and Tianjin, but he felt inadequate and deeply apprehensive. He acknowledged his lack of achievements in the past in serving the country and the people, and he feared that he would be unable to meet the expectations of the central government and the people of Beiping and Tianjin. He noted that Beiping and Tianjin are cultural centers and important national strongholds, and he humbly recognized his own limited knowledge and talent compared to the former commander, Wang. Therefore, he earnestly hoped for guidance from all sectors. He also expressed his hope that the division chiefs and staff members of the Garrison Headquarters, who have served the country for many years, would continue their efforts with the same spirit of assisting the former commander, Wang. Song emphasized his belief in Chinese morality, which can unite people's hearts and save the country. Therefore, he would permanently oppose the Communist Party and advocate for the promotion of moral values to save the country from crisis and maintain social order. Furthermore, he recognized that Beiping and Tianjin are areas where Chinese and foreigners converge, and he would uphold the central government's intention to foster good relations with neighboring countries to promote peace. Following Song's address, Shang Luntang, a member of the Executive Committee of the Chamber of Commerce, delivered a speech. He said that the merchants of Beiping were very pleased to hear of Commander Song's new appointment, but the business in Beiping has been declining recently, and he hoped that Commander Zhu would assist in improving the situation and provide guidance. Then, Bao Wenxue delivered a speech, stating that Beiping is an ancient city with a history of six or seven hundred years, and Tianjin is an important international commercial center. He expressed confidence that Song's appointment as commander would ensure the security of the local area. Finally, Shang Zhen delivered a speech, stating that the situation in North China is currently critical, and the most important thing is to stabilize the local area. If the local area can be stabilized, diplomacy will naturally progress, and the people will be able to live in peace. He noted that all parties hoped that Commander Song would take on the task of maintaining security, and the central government's announcement has fulfilled the wishes of the people of North China. He added that Hebei is closely related to Beiping and Tianjin, and if Beiping and Tianjin are unstable, Hebei will be in danger. Now that Beiping and Tianjin have the Great Wall as a solid defense, 30 million people can live in peace. The ceremony concluded at 12:00 noon, and everyone took a photo and dispersed. (21st Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Baoding) Wang Shuchang and Mo Dehui left for Hankou together by train at 4:00 AM on the 21st. Wan Fulin and others went to the station to see them off. (21st Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japanese Businessmen Flock to Tianjin for Inspection</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) Kawada Jun, a Japanese businessman who came to Tianjin for inspection, hosted a banquet for Chinese dignitaries on the evening of the 20th at the French Concession in Tianjin to foster goodwill. Over 20 prominent figures from various circles, including Cheng Ke, Wang Yitang, Cao Rulin, Bian Baimei, and Zhong Bingfeng, as well as bankers and industrialists, attended the banquet. Kawada also plans to visit various industrial enterprises in Tianjin starting on the 22nd. Sixteen members of the Japan Industry Association, including Yamada Takeo, arrived in Tianjin last month to inspect the economy and industry of North China. On the 21st, guided by Yamada, they transferred to Shandong and Henan to investigate coal and iron mines. (21st Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Conflict Arises in Zhangpu County Over Boat License Fees Collected by the Former Township Water Police</h3>
<p>Small Boats Go on Strike; Branch Office Destroyed by Five to Six Hundred People; One Policeman Killed, Three Squad Leaders Injured; Seven Instigators Arrested; Headquarters Dispatches Gunboat to Suppress</p>
<p>(Xiamen) In the old town of Tanpu County, a conflict broke out on the 18th between the water police and the people over the collection of boat license fees. Small boats went on strike, and a branch office was destroyed by five to six hundred people. Fifteen officers were disarmed, one water policeman, Li Enfu, was beaten to death, and three squad leaders, including Xu Yingxiong, were seriously injured. Seven others sustained minor injuries, and branch leader Li Shiqing was also injured. The Second Brigade Headquarters stationed in Xiamen sent personnel with a police squad to suppress the unrest. The Sixth Administrative Inspectorate arrested seven instigators, including Chen Sheng, for investigation. Xu and the other three were transported to Xiamen on the 20th for medical treatment, while Li also went to Zhangzhou for treatment. According to a telegram from the Provincial Headquarters, the Haiou gunboat was dispatched from Xiamen and transferred to Zhangpu on the 21st to assist in the suppression. According to the water police, the old town has long been a center for tax evasion and smuggling in Zhangzhou. This incident was instigated by local bullies who colluded with boat owners.

<h3>Yin Rugeng Visits Tada, Then Returns to Tangshan; Exchanges Views on Bandit Suppression with Takeshita</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) Yin Rugeng visited Tada, Commander of the Japanese Garrison in North China, and Chief of Staff Sakai at the Japanese Garrison Headquarters in North China on the morning of the 21st. He then visited Takeshita at the Tokiwa Hotel, where they exchanged views on the suppression of bandits in the area around Jiao Mountain Temple in Shanhaiguan. He returned to Tangshan in the afternoon. Takeshita plans to visit Shang Zhen in Beiping on the morning of the 21st to exchange views on the security of the war zone. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) After Yin Rugeng arrived in Tianjin yesterday, Takeshita, the head of the Japanese Special Service Agency in Luanxian, also arrived in Tianjin from Luanxian to visit Yin and discuss matters related to inspecting the counties in the war zone after taking office. They have agreed to inspect the Jixian and Miyun areas first, and the trip can be arranged within days. Yin is scheduled to return to Beiping tomorrow to handle affairs in the Jixian and Miyun areas. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Japanese, Kwantung, North China, and Japanese Garrison puppet allied military police went to the area around Jiao Mountain Temple in Shanhaiguan to search for bandits.

<p>(Xuzhou) The breach in the western dike of Mazhuangji in the middle reaches of the Grand Canal in Suqian caused water to flood into Gupi City and enter the territory of Suining. Fortunately, it was blocked by the old Yellow River dike, and Suining City was unharmed. Currently, the water depth in the Gupi City area reaches more than ten feet on flat ground. Currently, the water levels in all sections of the Suqian territory are rising, and everything above the Zaokou River has turned into a swamp. According to a Hai Xun report, Donghai, Guannan, and Shuyang counties jointly sent telegrams to the provincial government and the Grand Canal Conservancy Bureau, requesting the release of water from the water diversion dams to alleviate the disaster in the areas along the coast. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Qingjiangpu) For days, in Shuyang County, civilians have been working to reinforce the embankments of the Six Tang River. Tang Baoguang and others were reinforcing the breach behind Zhangzhuang Village on the Six Tang River embankment. Yuan Chengyan and others were reinforcing the breach at Qianwei. Other officials, such as District Chief Zhou Shouchu, were reinforcing the northern bank of the Chaimi River and the Guantian River in the Tenth District. Near Tanggou, in the Jiang Keheng Village area, seventy to eighty boy scouts from the county's elementary schools joined the flood prevention efforts. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Qingjiangpu) The authorities of the two flood prevention offices here expressed regret upon seeing the misunderstanding of the people of Xuhai regarding the various water diversion dams. They believe that the water level of the Six Tang River is still five centimeters away from the embankment, and the flow of the Grand Canal has not decreased. They plan to provide explanations so that all parties can understand the truth. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Qingjiangpu) According to people from Yaowan, the town is surrounded by water on three sides, with the Grand Canal to the southwest and the Shanhe River to the north, making it the most dangerous area. Currently, due to the breach in the western dike of the Mao'erwo Canal, the situation on the west side has eased slightly. However, the large amount of floodwater from Pixian is directly impacting the Shanhe River downstream, making the situation even more critical. Water has seeped under the base of the dikes, and water from the underground canals in the city is also overflowing, causing unrest among the people. Fortunately, Engineer Xu from the Construction Department is guiding the construction of the northern dike in the town. By reinforcing the solid old dike without working from the outside of the dike, the water is being managed more effectively, and no accidents have occurred. Otherwise, the town would have long suffered the disaster of high banks becoming valleys. It is also said that except for the county seat, the rest of Pixian was flooded, and many victims have taken refuge on Mount Suoyang. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Qingjiangpu) During the great flood of 1931, the base of the city wall at the north gate of Huai'an was completely submerged in water, and water poured in through the cracks, forcing pedestrians to roll up their trousers. As the water level of the Grand Canal rises daily, Liu Pingshi, the technical director of the county government, hired tile workers to apply cement to the base of the city wall along the river to prevent a recurrence of the disaster. The work has just been completed. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Qingjiangpu) Today, the water level at Wei rose by two centimeters, reaching 368.97 meters. The water level at Yao rose by two inches, reaching 266 inches. The water level at Su Zhang rose by two inches, reaching 209 inches. According to a telegram from Pixian County Magistrate Qin Jie to the Flood Prevention Office, the breach at Dayushu is over 60 zhang wide and over 2 zhang deep, making it impossible to block. Gu Lianqiu, the director of the First Section, also sent a similar telegram to the office. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Qingjiangpu) Xu Xinwu, the Director of the Grand Canal Conservancy Bureau and the Director of Flood Prevention in the Yi-Shu area, recently telegraphed Deng, the County Magistrate of Shuyang, and Xue, the Resident Engineer in Shuyang, stating that he had received a telegram from Provincial Chairman Chen, informing them that the amount of water discharged from the Six Tang River is increasing daily and the situation is serious. The new dike prepared in the previous year must be carefully protected. At the same time, Hao Guoxi, the Commissioner of Donghai, also telegraphed that the tidal water of the Guan River would be at its highest on the 14th and 15th and would gradually decrease after the 16th. According to the upstream areas of the Xiang Canal, the Six Tang River may be safe, but the protection efforts should not be neglected. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) The Yellow River diverts the Grand Canal to the sea, which is a critical period for the Six Tang River. Now it is shifting to Shuyang and Guannan counties. However, the flow is slow, causing pressure on the banks of the Grand Canal in the middle reaches. In order to protect the Grand Canal Conservancy project, the Grand Canal Flood Prevention Office has set up two water diversion dams at Wuhuaqiao and Liu Laorun on the upper and lower reaches of the Six Tang River to divert the Yellow River eastward. Yaowan and Suqian are located on the side of the Grand Canal, and the water level has reached the top of the dikes, with multiple areas being soaked. Therefore, Yaowan and Suqian are particularly dangerous. A large number of burlap bags have been prepared to fill and block the four gates and raise the embankments. Tens of thousands of civilians are guarding the dikes day and night. The westward flow of the Grand Canal spans dozens of miles, and the water has flooded the old city of Gupi, reaching the territory of Suining County. Fortunately, it was intercepted by the old course of the Yellow River. The western bank of the Grand Canal is a vast expanse of water, and over a hundred villages have been flooded. (21st Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>The Henan Economic Committee is Responsible for Blocking the Breach</h3>
<p>(Jinan) On the 15th, Han Fuqu telegraphed Jiang, suggesting fundamental solutions for controlling the Yellow River, such as building a control gate at Tongwaxiang and using the old course of the Yellow River to divert the flow. Jiang replied that he had received the telegram and that the fundamental treatment methods for the Yellow River were insightful and that he hoped a proposal for discussion could be submitted. The Henan Economic Committee stated that since blocking the breach was repeatedly entrusted, it should temporarily maintain the status quo, immediately excavate a diversion canal to guide the water back to its original course, and actively transport materials. Please expedite the allocation of funds. Jiang telegraphed Han, stating that the Jiangsu dam and the Li Shengcun residual embankment head project should be started immediately. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Kong Xiangrong Completes the Inspection of the Breach; The Director of the General Affairs Department of the Yellow River Association is Replaced</h3>
<p>(Kaifeng) Kong Xiangrong inspected Zhukou, crossed the river at Jingdongzhuang, and returned to Bian from Li Shengcun. Zhukou was flushed by the side flow. Dams 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 were submerged in water. After emergency repairs, the 2nd and 6th dams were reinforced. The Flood Prevention Office provided 3,000 ropes and mobilized the Hebei River soldiers to assist in the protection, and the danger has passed. Kong Xiangrong is scheduled to go to Nanjing on the evening of the 21st. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Kaifeng) Wang Huatang, the Director of the General Affairs Department of the Yellow River Association, resigned. Kong Xiangrong transferred Wang Chunyu, a specialist committee member, to succeed him. Wang Xinlian was hired to fill the vacancy. Wang and Wang arrived at the association on the 21st to assume their duties. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<h3>The Hebei Economic Association is Established; Zhou Zuomin Discusses the Association's Purpose</h3>
<p>(Beiping) The Hebei Economic Association held its inaugural meeting at the Bank Association at 2:00 PM today. All the initiators attended and passed the organizational charter. (21st Dispatch) (Beiping) The Hebei Economic Association held its inaugural meeting today and passed fourteen articles of association. Nine committee members were elected, including Zou Quansun, Zhu Shen, Fan Rui, Zhou Zuomin, Weng Wenhao, Zhong E, Ji Hua, Wu Dingchang, and He Lian. According to Zhou Zuomin, the purpose of establishing the Hebei Economic Association is to investigate and research and assist in the development of economic undertakings in Hebei. Its work guidelines are detailed in the articles of association. The colleagues usually serve in the economic circles of Hebei and know that Hebei is rich in resources, but the rural society is declining. To speak of relief, it is not effective without promoting the development of agriculture, industry, and commerce. Promoting development depends on the economy. However, economic relations are complex, and agriculture, industry, and commerce have their mutual relations. How to establish what has not been developed, and how to improve what has already been operated, cannot be clarified and planned without careful investigation and research. Such an institution in Hebei is still in its early stages of organization, so the association intends to devote itself to this, developing economic specialties, needing funds, or even using foreign capital, which is a natural trend. The funding methods needed must be carefully investigated and researched by experts before there is a standard. Recently, economic cooperation has been strongly advocated. This issue is indeed feasible on the principle of equality and mutual benefit, but it is necessary to understand the relationship between the material supply and demand of each other and adapt to the spirit of mutual benefit in order to achieve perfection. Without prior investigation and research, it is not effective. Before the association was established, there were many conjectures in the society. Now that its purpose, organization, and methods are specified in the articles of association, it invites support from all parties. (21st Dispatch)</p>

The third phase is for providing loans for seed and food, operating price stabilization measures, and providing spring relief. The first phase has already begun. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<h3>The 15th Anniversary of Zhu Zhixin's Martyrdom</h3>
<p>Memorial Ceremonies Held Separately by the Central Government and Various Localities</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The central government held a memorial ceremony for the 15th anniversary of Zhu Zhixin's martyrdom at 8:00 AM on the 21st. Members of the Central Committee, including Wang Zhaoming, Gu Zhenggang, Li Zonghuang, Ye Chuqiang, Hong Ludong, Ma Chaojun, Wang Qi, representatives of various agencies Niu Yongjian, Wen Yiyou, Chen Tongmin, Chen Rui, and Party officials, totaling approximately 600 people, attended the ceremony. Wang Zhaoming chaired the ceremony, and Ye Chuqiang gave a report, stating that Zhu's scholarship and morality are recorded in history books and recognized by everyone. He recalled that during the memorial ceremony for Zhu last year, Chairman Wang said in his speech that Zhu was eager to learn and hated evil like an enemy. These two words are very appropriate. In every memorial ceremony, there must be a special relationship between the memorializer and the memorialized, that is, the personality and career of the memorialized person give the memorializer a sense of admiration and longing. Our commemoration of Zhu is also to admire Zhu's great personality of eagerness to learn and hatred of evil. (21st Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The central government held a memorial ceremony for Zhu Zhixin on the morning of the 21st. Qi Chuqiang reported on the true meaning of the memorial. The original text is as follows: Comrades, today is the 15th anniversary memorial ceremony for Mr. Zhu Zhixin. The Central Committee originally appointed a representative to attend, but because the representative is ill, the report will be briefly presented by my brother. Mr. Zhu's scholarship, morality, writing style, and demeanor are all models for us, and comrades have a deep understanding of them. Last year today, Mr. Wang's report gave a very full explanation of Mr. Zhu's eagerness to learn and hatred of evil. Although it has been a year, it is still enough for us to appreciate Mr. Zhu when we commemorate him today. Speaking of the meaning of the memorial, there is a relationship between the memorializer and the memorialized, like Confucius' disciples mourning in the grave to commemorate Confucius, not entirely because of the teacher-student relationship, but because the disciples' scholarship and morality feel inferior to Confucius, so they hold the spirit of longing even though they cannot reach it to commemorate Confucius. For example, the Chinese workers' commemoration of Luban is also because the workers feel that their skills are not as good as Luban's, and they hope to achieve Luban's talent and personality, so they commemorate Luban. Our commemorative significance is also the same. Commemoration must be initiated by the same kind. We have never seen Jie and Zhou commemorate Yao and Shun, nor have we seen Robber Zhi commemorate Liuxiahui and Boyi, because they are not the same kind, and there is no intention to long for them, so there is no commemoration. Today, we commemorate Mr. Zhu. If we reflect on ourselves and see that we are indulging in pleasure and abandoning learning, we will feel ashamed. If we reflect on ourselves and see that we are reversing right and wrong everywhere, we will also feel ashamed. All the motivation for striving for self-improvement starts from the word "shame." A person who can know shame can make progress. We are Mr. Zhu's younger comrades, a younger generation who longs for him. If we can transform shame into striving and striving into progress, it will be the true meaning of today's commemoration in regard to eagerness to learn and hatred of evil. (21st Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>Current Events Commentary</p>
<h3>British and American Pacific Fleet Movements</h3>
<p>— Star</p>
<p>The war between Italy and Abyssinia has not yet begun, but the Pacific region has already been significantly affected. For several days, the British fleet stationed along the Chinese coast has been secretly redeploying westward, and it is rumored that the American Pacific Fleet will also pass through the Panama Canal and sail eastward. Recently, the British ship HMS "Clio," stationed in Weihaiwei, suddenly appeared in the waters off Singapore, raising many suspicions. On September 17th, the British Navy forbade the announcement of fleet movements. As of today, the British fleet in China is almost entirely gone. Meanwhile, news from Washington indicates that Navy Secretary Swanson has made statements indicating that if conflict arises between Italy and Abyssinia, the American Navy will prepare to move warships from the Pacific to the Atlantic to protect the safety of American shipping. The so-called protection of shipping is aimed at the recent activities of the British Navy and the League of Nations' economic sanctions plan. With so much happening in Europe, what will be the outcome in the Pacific?</p>
<p>Britain certainly values its interests in the Far East and understands the crises there. However, the most important lifeline of the British Empire lies in the Mediterranean, Red Sea, and Indian Ocean. The Singapore-to-Shanghai line is merely an extension of this lifeline. Therefore, to protect the safety of this main lifeline, British politicians are willing to adopt the "cutting off the hand to save the body" strategy. The British Empire's territory is vast, but its naval strength is ultimately limited. In the Atlantic region, interests in Canada, the West Indies, and South America have long been entrusted to the United States, leaving no time to look westward. In the Far East, whenever there is an emergency in Europe, Britain relies on Japan, as it did during the European War and the South African War, utilizing the Anglo-Japanese Alliance to avoid worrying about the East. As for Malta, Suez, and Aden, these three locations are vital chokepoints, and Britain cannot tolerate anyone sleeping soundly beside its bed. Therefore, as soon as the dispute between Italy and Abyssinia arose, Britain advocated intervention. Now, a large army is concentrated in the Mediterranean to protect the heart of the Empire, and the resulting emptiness in the East's defenses is inevitable.</p>
<p>As for the eastward movement of American warships, it is aimed at countering British interference with American merchant ships during wartime, in order to avoid the tragedies that occurred during the European War. The United States is not a member of the League of Nations, and once war breaks out, Anglo-American relations will become very complex. After all, it is the British fleet that would be blockading Italy, while it is mostly American merchant ships that are trading with Italy. The eastward and westward movements of American fleets are often related to the Washington government's Far Eastern policy. When it takes a hard line against Japan, the Atlantic Fleet moves westward, and when it takes a more compromising stance toward Japan, the fleet moves eastward. There have been many such movements since the September 18th Incident. Recently, due to Sir Otto Niemeyer's visit to China, calls for an alliance have become very noisy. With the official election of a president in the Philippines, the deterioration of Russian-American diplomacy, and the upcoming visit of the American Vice President to Tokyo, people are wondering whether the old Lansing-Ishii Agreement will be reenacted. During the European War, when Britain was preoccupied with the West, the Shandong Issue and the Twenty-One Demands occurred—we must not forget them. Today's Japan is no longer comparable to the Japan of 1914, and the prestige of Britain and the United States in the Far East is no longer what it once was. As we observe the redeployment of British and American fleets and the rising calls for an Asian Monroe Doctrine, can we not be stirred and consider how to cope with the current environment?</p>
<h3>League of Nations Assembly Committee Hopes for China's Success in Drug Suppression</h3>
<p>Chiang Kai-shek's Leadership Is Crucial; League of Nations Will Discuss the Issue of Increasing Council Seats Again</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Fifth Committee of the League of Nations Assembly met this afternoon. British delegate Ms. Horsbrugh, in discussing the report of the Opium Committee, stated that there had been considerable progress in international drug suppression work this year, and that the most important and noteworthy event was the implementation of China's drug suppression (especially morphine and heroin) plan under the leadership of Chiang Kai-shek. The Fifth Committee is paying close attention to the continued implementation of this plan and its successes, and hopes for its eventual success. Delegates from various countries on the committee have expressed their respective governments' willingness to assist China in this endeavor, which is extremely gratifying. The profits from opium smuggling are enormous, so the people of countries whose borders are closest to China are also most tempted by the profits of smuggling drugs. The Japanese government's expression of strict attention to cracking down on this is particularly commendable. As for Iran, it is still exporting large quantities of drugs to China, which Ms. Horsbrugh deeply regretted. (Central News Agency dispatch, 20th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Administrative Council will meet on Tuesday to discuss the issue of increasing China's Council seats. This matter was discussed once last week, but without results.

<h3>League of Nations Discusses Relief for White Russian Women</h3>
<p>Delegate Hu Does Not Oppose Sending Personnel to Investigate, but Advocates First Going to Harbin and Shenyang</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Fifth Committee of the League of Nations, namely the Social Issues Committee, continued its meeting today to discuss the opium problem, listening to the report of the Vietnamese authorities on prohibiting opium smoking. One section on school education mentioned that pictures and slogans describing the evils of opium have been posted throughout Vietnamese primary schools to serve as a warning. In addition, physical education is promoted to encourage young people to strengthen their bodies and avoid becoming addicted to drugs. The committee then discussed the issue of relief for White Russian women in China. Chinese delegate Hu Shih-tse, the Chinese envoy to Switzerland, spoke, saying that the Chinese government considers the issue of relief for White Russian women to be extremely important, and therefore does not oppose the League of Nations sending personnel to China to handle this matter, on the condition that the Chinese government does not bear the cost. Furthermore, in order to achieve a fundamental resolution of this issue, the specialists sent by the League of Nations should not only conduct research in Shanghai, but should also go to places like Harbin and Shenyang for investigation.

<h3>Philippines' Movement to Join the League of Nations; U.S. Government Makes No Statement on Quezon's Request</h3>
<p>(Washington) A dispatch from Manila stated that the recently elected President of the Philippines, Quezon, will contact the United States regarding the issue of the Philippines joining the League of Nations. The State Department today declined to comment on this, stating only that it had not received a formal report. However, Section 2 of the Philippine Independence Act stipulates that the foreign affairs of the Philippine autonomous government shall be directly supervised by the United States. Therefore, if the Philippines wishes to join the League of Nations before gaining full independence, it must be approved by Congress. (Kuomin News Agency dispatch, 20th)</p>
<p>(New York) Congressman Fish, a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, sent a telegram today congratulating the people of the Philippines on electing Quezon as the first president of the autonomous government. Fish told the Associated Press that he had been friends with Quezon for many years, knew him very well, and had cooperated with Quezon to complete the independence of the Philippines. He firmly believes that the friendship between the Filipinos and Americans will last forever, and that the economic relations between the United States and the Philippines will continue to be consolidated and strengthened. Regarding the concerns of the United States about the Philippine textile market, he is confident that the Philippine government will soon be able to consider the expressions of the majority of congressmen representing the American textile industry. (Kuomin News Agency dispatch, 20th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Japanese Ambassador to the United States Saito declared after meeting with State Department officials today that Japan would voluntarily restrict its cotton textile trade with the Philippines. Regarding relations between the two countries, in light of the impending establishment of the Philippine autonomous government, both sides unanimously hope that Japan and the United States can peacefully allocate the Philippine market. Saito indicated today that preventing the trade volume from increasing is the only outstanding issue before concluding an agreement. (Kuomin News Agency dispatch, 20th)</p>

<h3>Political Turmoil in Spain</h3>
<p>Madrid: Since the resignation of the Lerroux Cabinet, President Zamorra has begun seeking opinions from leaders of various political parties, meeting with House Speaker Alba, Tefforasco, leader of the right-wing Agrarian Party, and Bassiano, representative of the left-wing Republican Action Party. Afterwards, Alba declared that he had suggested to the President that the country maintain a neutral position externally and maintain the current session of the House without re-elections internally, otherwise it would lead to civil war. Tefforasco also suggested to the President that the new cabinet should be similar in nature to the resigning cabinet, that is, it should still be formed by a coalition of the centrist Radical Party and the right-wing Popular Action Party, the Agrarian Party, and the Liberal Democratic Party. As for Bassiano, he advocated that a cabinet be formed by genuine republican figures to fully restore constitutional norms, and explained the abnormal political situation over the past year. He said that the best plan now is to dissolve the House and hold re-elections. (Havas News Agency dispatch, 21st)</p>

It stated that the actions of the resigning cabinet were mostly contrary to the spirit of the constitution, especially regarding the issue of Catalonia's autonomy. The province, according to the constitution, should originally enjoy autonomy. Therefore, the party put forward four demands: (1) dissolve the House of Representatives and hold new elections under the auspices of a loyal republican government; (2) restore all rights granted by the constitution; (3) release political prisoners; (4) determine the responsibility for the government's abuse of power. In addition, those who have held power but whose abilities are insufficient, and who have therefore suspended ordinary law and adopted special laws to protect their shortcomings, should not be allowed to participate in politics in the future. Regarding foreign policy, the party stressed that Spain should adhere to the various principles of the League of Nations. (Havas News Agency dispatch, 21st)</p>
<h3>Greek Restoration Issue</h3>
<p>Athens: The cabinet had previously decided to hold a plebiscite on November 3rd to resolve the issue of the form of government. Most groups belonging to the republican faction recently held a meeting and resolved to form a united front to oppose the restoration, and declared that even if the royalists use violent means, they will not yield. In addition, Sophoulis, the leader of the opposition Liberal Party, recently published a declaration in the newspapers, commenting on the government's predetermined plebiscite procedures. He claimed that the measures adopted by the government are sufficient to allow government-backed pro-restoration figures to vote multiple times in succession, which is extremely unfair. Currently, about 80% of the people in the country support the republican system, and the republican faction is deeply certain of the results of the plebiscite, so the faction will continue to fight to the end.

<h3>The Pitiful Air Force of Abyssinia: Only Twelve Aircraft and Eight Pilots</h3>
<p>(Paris) According to a dispatch from the Abyssinian correspondent of the "Concorde" newspaper, the Abyssinian Air Force has a total of twelve aircraft and eight pilots. All the pilots are fully qualified, and five of them have received training at French schools. (Shanghai "Chinese Courier" September 19th special dispatch)</p>
<h3>The Italian Cabinet Announces That the League of Nations' Proposals Are Difficult to Accept</h3>
<p>Had Previously Contacted the British and French Ambassadors; The British and French Cabinets Held Separate Meetings</p>
<p>(Rome) The Italian cabinet met for a long time today, and finally rejected the peaceful solution to the Italian-Abyssinian dispute proposed by the Five-Nation Committee of the League of Nations. After the meeting, a communique was issued, stating that while the cabinet appreciated the efforts of the special committee, it felt that the proposed solution could not be accepted because it did not have a sufficient minimum basis for final implementation and did not practically consider Italy's essential rights. The cabinet meeting was chaired by Mussolini, who reported on the political and military situation for an hour and set September 24th as the date for the next cabinet meeting. (Reuters dispatch, 21st)</p>
<p>(Rome) The first impression here of Italy's rejection of the Five-Nation Committee's proposal is that Italy, although it has closed the door to mediation, has not locked it. The general Italian public now feels that the work of the Five-Nation Committee will not be able to resume, but that there is still the possibility of direct negotiations to seek a solution. It is noteworthy that the wording of the communique issued after the cabinet meeting was moderate. (Reuters dispatch, 21st)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The news of Italy's rejection of the Five-Nation Committee's proposal caused great shock in the League of Nations, as the League initially expected Mussolini to accept the committee's proposal as a basis for negotiation. It is widely felt that the League of Nations is now facing the greatest difficulty in its history, and that this is the most serious situation that Europe has encountered since the Great War. General opinion supports upholding the League of Nations Covenant, and it is believed that any measures decided by the League of Nations Administrative Council will receive unanimous support. Representatives from various countries have expressed their regret over Italy's decision. (Reuters dispatch, 21st)</p>
<p>(London) Both the British government and the public were surprised to hear that Italy had rejected the Five-Nation Committee's proposal, but still hope for a turnaround. Since Italy has made this decision, the British cabinet will have no choice but to meet next week. Prime Minister Baldwin will return to London on Sunday evening, and the cabinet meeting may be held on Monday, but it is likely to be held on Tuesday as Italy's decision has not yet been transmitted to Geneva. The actions of the Italian government and the consequences they will cause may cause the British Parliament to reconvene before the deadline for the recess on October 29th. However, the current international situation may remain complex in the near future, making it inconvenient for Parliament to conduct public discussions at this time. If so, the government will consult with the leaders of the opposition parties or decide not to convene Parliament early. (Reuters dispatch, 21st)</p>
<p>(Paris) While French cabinet members were concluding a dinner, the news suddenly arrived that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini had rejected the proposals of the Five-Nation Committee. The French cabinet members were shocked. French Prime Minister Laval recently made a promise in Geneva that France would not evade its obligations under the Covenant. The question of whether the French cabinet will fulfill this promise is what the French people are most eager to know. It is widely believed that France will not react as long as Britain provides guarantees to uphold the Covenant in the event of events in Central Europe. Although the Italian communique rejected the Geneva plan, its wording was still moderate, so the French cabinet still hopes that this is not Mussolini's final word. French observers interpret the Italian communique as containing Italy's willingness to continue diplomatic talks. (Reuters dispatch, 21st)</p>
<p>(Paris) The French cabinet held an important meeting today, mainly discussing the extent to which it would support Britain in upholding the League of Nations Covenant. The cabinet meeting lasted for more than four hours. The communique issued did not mention this point, but stated that French President Lebrun, on behalf of the cabinet meeting, congratulated and thanked Laval for his courageous and skillful actions in Geneva in the name of France for the sake of peace. The communique also stated that Laval detailed the diplomatic situation to the cabinet members. (Reuters dispatch, 21st)</p>
<p>(Rome) After initially reviewing the proposals of the League of Nations Five-Nation Committee, Mussolini immediately met with French Ambassador de Chambrun, and separately ordered Undersecretary of Foreign Affairs Suvich to meet with British Ambassador Drummond. Political circles attach great importance to this, but are skeptical of the outcome. After today's cabinet meeting, a reply will be sent to Geneva. The reply will include some annotations so that the Five-Nation Committee can continue its work. Since Mussolini's attitude has undergone such a change, officials are eager to state that Italy's military actions in East Africa are merely precautionary measures, and at most "will not exceed the nature of colonial conquest, as British troops use tanks, artillery, and other modern weapons in the Northwest Frontier of India." It is also stated that Italy will never be the instigator of European conflicts. (Kuomin News Agency dispatch, 21st)</p>
<p>(London) Well-informed sources declared today that, although there has been no official statement, it is currently believed that Prime Minister Mussolini's rejection of the Five-Nation Committee's proposals may be an implicit suggestion that Mussolini is willing to reopen the Three-Nation Conference. Therefore, although the efforts of the Five-Nation Committee are ineffective, there is still the possibility of continued activity in Geneva. The entrance to the Strait of Gibraltar is now full of obstacles and is practically blocked. At the same time, a squadron of Spanish aircraft, totaling fifteen, soared through the sky, strengthening the rear of Gibraltar. In view of the seriousness of the European situation, the Dutch government decided today to increase its military strength in preparation for international changes. (Kuomin News Agency dispatch, 20th)</p>
<p>(London) It has been learned today that Britain has no intention of reopening the Three-Nation Conference as reported this morning. Britain, like Italy, is now in a precarious situation. Those familiar with the situation do not believe that Britain will dismiss its fleet and stand by while Mussolini devours Abyssinia. (Kuomin News Agency dispatch, 20th)</p>
<h3>French Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Denies Sanctions Against Italy; Navy Denies Transferring Warships to Philippine Ports</h3>
<p>(Paris) The Foreign Ministry spokesperson today strenuously denied reports that France has agreed with Britain on sanctions against Italy. (Kuomin News Agency dispatch, 20th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Rumors that four warships stationed in Toulon have been ordered to sail to Djibouti, a French colony in East Africa, have now been officially denied by the Navy. (Havas News Agency dispatch, 20th)</p>
<p>(London) French Prime Minister Laval has telegraphed Mussolini urging him to accept the Five-Person Committee's proposals as the basis for discussing the Italian-Abyssinian dispute, according to news published in the "Evening Standard." The newspaper also said that Laval warned Mussolini that now is the time for reconciliation, and France cannot do anything to help Italy. Laval also declared to British representative Eden that in any emergency, no matter how serious, France will act in tandem with Britain. (Reuters dispatch, 21st)</p>
<p>(Paris) A Paris newspaper today published an article by Perrault, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee, strongly criticizing sanctions against Italy, saying that military sanctions, no matter what they are called, must be rejected. He also discussed economic sanctions, saying that with the three major powers of Germany, the United States, and Japan staying out of it, what is the point of talking about a blockade? (Note: Perrault once served as the French ambassador to Italy.) (Reuters dispatch, 20th)</p>
<h3>Mediterranean Sea: Disposition of British Warships; Barbed Wire at the Gibraltar Port</h3>
<p>(London) The current disposition of the British naval fleet in the Mediterranean and Red Seas, as determined by investigation, is as follows: Gibraltar port has a garrison of 55 warships, Aden port has 10 warships, Haifa port has 5 warships, Port Said has 2 warships, and there is one warship in transit. One reconnaissance ship passed through the Suez Canal yesterday. In addition, Singapore has one aircraft carrier and two destroyers. (Havas dispatch, 20th)</p>

<p>Gibraltar: The military transport ship Lancashire recently arrived here from Shaldon, England, preparing to sail to Malta. Additionally, the cruiser HMS Ajax loaded 160 artillerymen and engineers here and also departed for Malta today. (Havas dispatch, 21st)</p>
<h3>Missing Italian Troops: Related to Deployment to North Africa, but Officials Have Yet to Acknowledge</h3>
<p>(Rome) It is now believed here that the two "missing" divisions, totaling 35,000 men, have been deployed to the Italian colony of Cyrenaica in North Africa, located between Tripolitania and Egypt. However, this claim has not been acknowledged by official circles. It is reported that these two divisions departed from Genoa aboard 18 transport ships from September 7th to 18th, allegedly heading to East Africa. However, their whereabouts remain unknown, giving rise to various speculations. It was previously claimed here that troops withdrawn from Libya to serve in East Africa would be replaced by African soldiers. It is worth noting that the number of troops withdrawn did not amount to two divisions. (Reuters dispatch, 21st)</p>
<p>(Rome) According to responsible sources here, reports in foreign newspapers about Italian troops deploying to Libya are inaccurate. The number of Italian troops sent to Libya so far is very small, only enough to replace soldiers transferred from Libya to East Africa. However, according to foreign sources, the Italian government has sent approximately 40,000 reinforcements to Libya, fearing an uprising by the Senussi in that region, hence this action. (Shanghai Zilin News, September 19th dispatch)</p>
<h3>Albania Hires Turkish Officers; Builds Hindenburg Line; Albanian Women Form Women's Army</h3>
<p>Tirana: Albania anticipates that the start of war is only a few days away and is now hastily making final preparations to counter an Italian invasion. General Vahid, a Turkish officer hired by Albania, is currently engaged in constructing a "Hindenburg Line" southwest of Jijiga, as well as improving old forts and adding new batteries and trenches. Tirana now dispatches reinforcements to Diredawa daily, then on to the Harar front. The movement of troops indicates that the Albanian King intends to concentrate his forces in the south. If Italy declares war, the Albanian King may establish an advantage in the south. Many Albanian women are following their husbands into the military. The wife of a certain officer is now organizing a women's army, personally commanding a machine gun squad. Last night, 15,000 new recruits arrived here, many bringing their wives, sisters, and daughters. Today, over 30,000 soldiers in Tirana conducted a military parade, and 200 military vehicles paraded through the streets, disrupting traffic for several hours. Over 1,200 boy scouts are currently in training, preparing to assist the police in maintaining order in the event of enemy air raids. The so-called "Hindenburg Line" was a line of fortresses constructed by the German army after the Battle of the Somme in 1916, being the most difficult defense to breach. (Reuters dispatch, 21st)</p>
<p>Tirana: Abyssinian women have recently organized a women's army battalion, preparing to fight independently from the men. The battalion consists of 100 women, mostly from prominent families, wearing military uniforms and carrying pistols. The battalion commander, Mrs. Keuru Dudu, is the niece of the late Albanian nobleman Hashima. Mrs. Keuru Dudu recently went with her husband to inspect the front line in the Ogaden province of Italian Somaliland. It is said that during the Battle of Adwa in 1896, when Albania defeated the Italian army, Albania also had a women's army. (Havas dispatch, 21st)</p>
<h3>Albanian Emperor Holds Solemn Religious Ceremony in Ancient Palace; Hosts Foreign Journalists</h3>
<p>Tirana: This morning, the Albanian Emperor held a religious ceremony in the ancient palace. The ceremony was extremely solemn. The King sat on a jewel-encrusted throne covered with brocade, with many red cushions placed to the left and right. The hall for the ceremony was a military banquet hall, which was very large. The King sat at one end, surrounded by hundreds of clergy dressed in splendid gold, purple, green, yellow, and blue robes. Behind them stood attendants holding decorated parasols over their heads. First, diplomats were granted an audience, including Italian Ambassador Count Vinci. The Count stepped forward slowly, bowed slightly, and shook hands with the King. At this time, the entire hall was silent. After all the ambassadors had been granted an audience, the clergy began to chant prayers in a low voice, their voices soft and pleasant. Then, choirboys sang hymns praising the Albanian King. After the hymns were sung, a silver-handled staff was waved in the air. Then, a choir sang, with 200 singers in total. They struck the ground with staves to keep time, and the ground was covered with precious carpets. Gongs and drums were sounded to accompany the singing. The singing was loud and clear, and the crowd gradually began to dance. Then, twelve clergy slowly danced to mournful music, clapping their hands, shouting, cheering, and making various gestures. Gradually, the dance became more intense, their appearance becoming frenzied. After the dance, the Albanian religion explained its doctrines in Arabic, which was translated into Amharic. The ceremony lasted for two hours. Finally, the chief bishop blessed the King and the assembly, and the ceremony ended. (Reuters dispatch, 21st)</p>
<p>Tirana: The Albanian Emperor hosted a grand banquet for journalists in the palace last night, attended by 85 journalists from various countries. During the banquet, the Albanian Emperor declared that he would not accept any form of mandate from the League of Nations that infringed upon Albania's sovereignty and independence. Albania has been independent and autonomous for 2,000 years and will never willingly accept the protection of others. "I am the master of Albania and the protector of the Albanian people. I will lead the army and personally fight the enemy. Even if it goes against God's will, we are prepared to shed blood. We will not make any economic or territorial concessions to Italy without adequate compensation. Furthermore, we must obtain a guarantee that Italy will not attack us before making any of the aforementioned concessions. Since our country is an independent nation, we must defend our freedom."

<h3>Germany's Neutral Stance; Greatly Astonished by Italy's Rejection of Proposal; Believes German Attack on Memel is Ridiculous</h3>
<p>(Berlin) Political circles were greatly astonished to hear the news that Italy had rejected the proposal of the Five-Nation Committee. However, they still hope that negotiations can continue to avert war. People believe that since Hitler previously stated in Nuremberg that the German government would not interfere in any events unrelated to Germany, if Italy and Albania go to war, the German government will declare neutrality. A government spokesman today dismissed reports in French newspapers that German troops would attack Memel as ridiculous, saying that what the Germans want is for the signatories of the Memel Convention, namely Britain, France, Italy, and Japan, to fulfill their responsibilities and restore Memel's autonomy. (Reuters dispatch, 21st)</p>
<h3>Italian Ambassador Visits U.S. Undersecretary of State; Canadian Labor Movement Advocates Sanctions Against Italy</h3>
<p>(Washington) Italian Ambassador to the United States, Rosso, visited Undersecretary of State Phillips today to discuss the European situation. Before leaving, Rosso stated that the visit was not important, only to allow the State Department to fully understand Italy's views. It is heard that the Navy Department has dispatched four wireless radio experts to Tirana to maintain Albania's telecommunications with the United States in the event of war between Italy and Albania. (Reuters dispatch, 20th)</p>
<p>New Orleans: Veterans today demanded an amendment to the Constitution, stipulating that the United States permanently maintain neutrality and explicitly stating that the United States may not participate in any treaties that could lead to war. This demand was a resolution unanimously passed at the Veterans' Annual Convention currently being held here. They also demanded the adoption of a policy prohibiting the shipment of arms to warring nations and abandoning the government's responsibility to protect American investments abroad.

<h3>Japanese Finance Minister Takahashi Discusses Situation; Italy's Advance or Retreat is Difficult; Domestic Problems Are Very Tricky</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Finance Minister Takahashi gave a talk on the current situation on the evening of the 20th, saying that Italy and Albania are likely to go to war, but in reality, it is unlikely to happen. Italy is troubled by domestic problems. If the national sentiment is extremely high and there is no war, it is feared that the people will be dissatisfied. If a war breaks out one day and the war is prolonged, Italy's finances and economy will suddenly collapse, leading to an unmanageable situation. Considering this matter, Italy will not engage in a formal war. Today, Italy's position is what is called 'advancing or retreating is difficult'. In order to contain Italy, Britain has resolutely decided to intervene in the dispute. The background is the unanimous public opinion of the whole country, so they can have this determination. In short, future wars will not only be military wars, but also include diplomatic, economic, and other strategies. Therefore, we must consider the financial and economic positions and carry out national policies. Next, the Finance Minister spoke about the new party issue, saying that it is rumored that he will be the president of the new party, but he has no such intention. Recently, there have been many local elections in the neutral position. This phenomenon shows that the people require a unified national politics, and there is no need for two major political parties. In short, constitutional politics is not a matter of the number of parliamentarians, but a matter of substance. (Japan United News dispatch, 21st)</p>

<h3>Luo Jialun's Wife Gives a Speech: Self-Help and Self-Redemption</h3>
<p>Encouraging the People to Generously Help the Disaster and Hoping that Women's Circles Will Help with Relief</p>
<p>Beijing News: Ms. Zhang Shuizhen, wife of Luo Jialun, gave a speech on the Central Broadcasting Station on the 20th, entitled "Self-Help and Self-Redemption." The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>"This year, the cruelty and breadth of the floods in various parts of our country have actually exceeded those of the 20th year of the Republic of China. The main disaster area in the 20th year was only the Yangtze River. This year, in addition to the Yangtze River, the Yellow River is also running rampant everywhere, causing disasters everywhere. Combining large and small rivers, the area affected by flooding has reached 16 provinces, and the number of disaster victims has reached 25 million. Most of Hubei has been submerged, and the great disaster in Shandong and Henan has not yet passed, but the tragedy in northern Jiangsu is getting more serious every day. For more than two months, the people of northern Jiangsu, under the leadership of the government, have been truly moved by their spirit of fighting against the water. However, their painful efforts ultimately cannot withstand the rushing Yellow River. The news from the newspapers these days is even more shocking. Overnight, thousands of hectares of farmland and dozens of villages were submerged. The telegram from County Magistrate Qin of Pi County on the 15th stated that 500,000 people were submerged in the entire county, with elderly disaster victims throwing themselves into the water, strong men weeping, and women and children drowning themselves by tying ropes together. Every word is a tear, and no one can read it without feeling grief. Such a cruel disaster, even if it happened in another country, we should, based on the great righteousness of human sympathy, do our best to provide relief. Moreover, the victims are all compatriots who share our joys and sorrows. How can we bear to sit idly by? We must know that these suffering compatriots are all exploited working people. The abundant food and clothing and the glory and wealth that we enjoy in the cities are all accumulated from their sweat and blood, drop by drop, in ordinary times. Their lives are already hard enough in ordinary times, and now they are suffering this unprecedented catastrophe. All the land and resources they depend on for a living have been submerged. Their beloved family members have died, and they cannot even see their bodies. They are enduring hunger and cold, and they have to bear to watch their aging relatives and weak children suffer. These disaster victims are truly living a hellish life on earth. I deeply feel that those of us who live a comfortable life are giving some money and effort to the suffering compatriots, which is nothing more than atoning for our own sins.</p>
<p>Regarding raising donations to help our compatriots, I think the first thing is to be universal. We must make the majority of the people in the country do their best. Those who have money donate money, and those who have things donate things. Like the most recent measure of the government requiring soldiers in the army to contribute 20 cents each, it is very meaningful. I hope that students from schools at all levels, workers from all industries, employees from all stores, and men, women, old and young in families can unite. Even if each person donates a few coppers, it can have the effect of many contributions making a fur coat. I hope that residents of various places and major cities will initiate strict organizations or improve existing organizations to conduct widespread fundraising activities. On the one hand, it can save the lives of many compatriots, and on the other hand, it can stimulate everyone's compassion for protecting their compatriots. It has a great effect on uniting national sentiment and inspiring national consciousness.</p>
<p>Second, I want to advise those who have the ability to quickly and generously donate. According to the experience of fundraising everywhere, those with less income and more difficult lives tend to have a stronger sense of compassion. If we pay attention to this kind of news, we can find touching materials at any time. This is certainly a ray of dawn for the future of our national rejuvenation. However, seeing the difficulties in fundraising in major cities in the north and south this time, we have to attribute it to the cold indifference of most of the wealthy families. Looking at Shanghai, the economic center of China, it actually used various strange methods to call for donations, and the result was only 500,000 in repaid advances. The difficulty of our national economy is certainly a fact, but according to a conservative estimate, in the current situation, as long as people with property and status, abundant income, and the ability to help others unanimously launch the enthusiasm to help their compatriots, then only in a few major cities, it is not difficult to raise a donation of one or two thousand million. The miserable life of Chinese rural compatriots is precisely the sin of the wealthy class in the cities. Now they are hiding on the treetops and floating on the water, asking us for some coarse grains to fill their hunger and some warm clothes to ward off the cold, in order to maintain the lives that their parents have worked so hard to raise. What are we waiting for if we, who are well-fed and clothed, do not atone for our sins at this time? We must see clearly the situation. In this year, internal and external troubles are pressing so tightly, and the survival of the country has reached an unprecedented difficult juncture. At the same time, the international situation is extremely dangerous. Personal movable and immovable property are unreliable. Instead of losing them unclearly in the future, it is better to generously donate a portion today to save the lives of our compatriots. Saving our compatriots is saving the country, and saving the country is saving ourselves. May everyone arouse their conscience. Those who have not donated should do their best to donate, and those who have already donated, if they have a little surplus strength, please continue to contribute. Finally, from the standpoint of the Women's Disaster Relief Association, I want to give a piece of advice to my female compatriots in Beijing and across the country who have clothes to wear and food to eat. Broadly speaking, these female compatriots who have been affected by the disaster are productive people in the countryside, while most of the women in our cities, especially those in the middle and upper classes, are consumers. Our comfortable lives and luxurious enjoyment are the price paid by our rural sisters who live like cattle and horses and work hard all year round. Now that they cannot even maintain a life like cattle and horses, are we unwilling to make a small sacrifice? We can discount our daily living expenses or divide some of the funds for entertainment and socializing. Mothers can also contribute some of the money for snacks for their children as a contribution to helping the children in the disaster area. This method also has educational value. Compassion is our innate talent as women. We should, based on the spirit of loving our own children, especially think of ways for the thousands upon thousands of innocent children in the disaster area who are waiting to die.</p>
<p>Relief must be urgent. The lives of the affected compatriots cannot wait for us to hesitate. Everyone, get up quickly. This is our only opportunity for self-help, and it is also our only opportunity for self-redemption."</p>
<h3>Qiantang River Bridge Construction Recent News: Another Large Pile Driving Ship Arrives</h3>
<p>Hangzhou News: Since the commencement of the Qiantang River Bridge, the project's status has been reported in newspapers. The following is a summary of its recent progress:</p>
<p>(1) The main bridge section has a total of fifteen piers, all located in the river, which are the most difficult part of the entire project. Kangyi Company previously contracted for this. Since construction began, as of May this year, cofferdams made of steel sheet piles have been built for the first pier on the north bank and the fourteenth and fifteenth piers on the south bank. Caissons were built inside the cofferdams, and preparations were made for driving foundation piles. The caissons for piers two to thirteen also began to be manufactured at the factory on the south bank. Unexpectedly, in June, excessive rainfall caused mountain torrents upstream, and the water level at the bridge site rose sharply. The river flow was very fast, and the riverbed was scoured to a depth of more than twenty feet, causing the collapse of the fourteenth and fifteenth cofferdams. Most of the steel sheet piles at the bottom of the river were covered by quicksand. Efforts were made to salvage them, but due to the difficulty of the work, they have not yet been completely retrieved. As for the construction of the first pier on the north bank, progress is relatively smooth. A section of the reinforced concrete pier wall has now been built, and the air compressor and air pipes have been completely installed. It is now preparing to use the compressed air method to excavate soil and sink the caisson. Three reinforced concrete caissons for piers two to thirteen have been manufactured at the south bank caisson factory. Temporary dock tracks are now being built extending into the river, preparing to use a crane to lift the caissons, put them into the river, sail them to the appropriate locations for each pier, and then inject compressed air to excavate the soil and sink them. Each of these caissons weighs more than six hundred tons. Lifting and launching them into the river is no easy task. This kind of difficult project is the first trial in China.</p>
<p>(2) The north bank approach bridge is contracted by the Dongya Engineering Company. This section of the bridge has a total of ten piers of varying sizes and forms. The depth of the foundations also varies, so the method of building the foundations varies accordingly. Some use only the excavation method to build the foundation directly on the rock layer, while others require driving wooden piles from fifty to ninety feet long to reach the rock layer. Still others use the open caisson method to excavate soil and sink it fifty or sixty feet to reach the rock layer. Construction has now started in order. Several piers have been completed and are preparing for upper-layer reinforced concrete work, while others are still driving piles and excavating soil. The work is quite intense.</p>
<p>(3) The south bank approach bridge is contracted by the Xinheng Construction Factory. This part of the project is more difficult than the foundation work of the north bank approach bridge. Although there are only five piers, the foundation is poor and the rock layer is very deep, so wooden piles up to one hundred feet long must first be driven before the foundation can be built. The two piers near the riverbank are very deep and difficult to excavate, so steel sheet pile cofferdams must first be driven. Also, because the geological condition is iron plate sand, it is not easy to drive the steel sheet piles. Water jetting machines are currently used to assist in pile driving. On the south bank, pile drivers, cranes, employee dormitories, and all materials and tools are scattered all over the place, facing the main bridge caisson factory upstream from afar. In addition, material transport ships are crowded, and the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway also uses this as its terminus, forming a new industrial zone.</p>
<p>(4) The steel beams for the main bridge are contracted by the Daomenlang Company and are currently being manufactured in the UK. The steel materials for the approach bridge are contracted by Siemens and are being manufactured in Germany. The first batch of these are already on their way to China.</p>
<p>More than fifty bridge construction office staff members work as usual even on Sundays. Field construction workers must work day and night shifts. Also, to cultivate talent, in addition to the approval to increase the number of civil engineering graduates from various universities as trainees last year and this year, a summer internship program was opened in July and August this summer. More than ten universities across the country recommended third-year engineering students to come for internships. A total of eighty-seven people reported for duty.</p>
<p>Songjiang</p>
<p>The Wen Temple in this county has lacked management over the years and has been damaged by military activities. The temple appearance is dilapidated. After the national government ordered the repair of the Confucius Temple, the county government ordered the Education Bureau to plan the repairs, and at the same time summoned various agencies and local people to raise donations. After several months of fundraising and material preparation, it has now been renovated. Zhu Yunxin, Shen Xian, and other elders and gentlemen of the county, as well as people from all walks of life, initiated a ceremony to be held at the temple at Mou Shi (5-7 AM) on August 27th of the lunar calendar to worship Confucius. At 10 AM, there will be a blessing feast to honor the Confucian way. Jin Tigan, the county magistrate of this county, recently telegraphed the province to resign from his position. The heads of various districts jointly telegraphed the province, requesting retention so that Zhu Jing's facilities, such as supervising the sea visit and Baojia work, can be effective. Other groups are also jointly discussing countermeasures to retain him.</p>
<p>Nanhui: Improper Arrest Dispute by Tax Police Resolved</p>
<p>The dispute over the improper arrest by the tax police of Wai Sanzhao was resolved on the 20th when You Bingzhao, the district chief of the tax police, came to the city and negotiated a solution with the county government: (1) The county government will assist in the investigation and arrest of the salt smugglers who resisted arrest and lost firearms by the tax police. (2) The five arrested people, including Tang Yunliang, will be interrogated by District Chief You. If they are innocent, they will be released immediately. Those who are suspected will be sent to the county for interrogation and handling according to the law. The firearms collected from the sentry posts will be handed over to the county government for inspection. Li Dengke, the captain of the tax police team, will go to Sanzhao to comfort the public and withdraw the stationed troops. Therefore, this case has come to an end.</p>
<p>Taicang County Government Cables Province to Re-Survey Disaster Situation</p>
<p>This year, the county's cotton and rice crops suffered from drought in the early summer, and then suffered from disasters such as fog, rain, wind, and insects after autumn. For the past two weeks, the county government has repeatedly cabled the provincial government for instructions and has first appointed six members to go to various districts for investigation. On the 20th, together with Lu Lianjie, a member of the Provincial Government, they cabled the provincial government to request the speedy dispatch of a member to the county for a re-survey. At the same time, they instructed the heads of various townships to inform the farmers that they must not gather in the city and riot arbitrarily. However, thousands of people still go to the county every day to report the disaster.</p>
<p>Suzhou: Opening Coffin for Examination Due to Abuse of Daughter-in-Law Leading to Death</p>
<p>Lin Jimei, the wife of Zhang Gengtu, a villager in the Zhu Jingqiao area outside Panmen, Suzhou, recently pregnant for five months, was severely beaten by her father-in-law Zhang Caitang and aunt Shen in early this month, causing a miscarriage and death. At that time, they did not publicize it and proceeded with the burial. Lin Baohe, the father of the deceased, also received money and did not publicize it. Unexpectedly, neighbors who knew about the previous situation were indignant and could not calm down. The matter was detected by the police district in charge, and Zhang Caitang, Zhang Shen, and Lin Baohe were detained and sent to the local court. Zhang Shen was detained, and Zhang Caitang and others were released on bail. On the morning of the 21st, Prosecutor Luo was dispatched to the village with officials to open the coffin for examination. At that time, it was verified that there were many wounds on the body, and it was indeed a death due to a severe miscarriage. Zhang Gengtu, the husband of the deceased, was immediately ordered to re-coffin the body, awaiting investigation and handling.</p>
<p>Wuxi: Zhendong Factory Strike Expands</p>
<p>Since the strike at the Zhendong Yarn Factory outside Ximen, Manager Jiang Zeqing has taken refuge in Shanghai, resulting in a prolonged delay. The Cotton Industry Workers' Union, the Silk Factory Industry Workers' Union, and more than twenty labor unions, such as the Shenxin, Guangqin, Yeqin, Qingfeng, and Yukang Yarn Factories, previously gathered to discuss and organize a support association. Yesterday (the 21st) at 10 AM, they specially sent out more than forty representatives, jointly going to the county party headquarters and the county government to petition. The representatives requested that Jiang Zeqing be ordered to come to Wuxi to seek a solution quickly. County Magistrate Wang agreed to work with the party headquarters to seek a solution in the shortest possible time. The representatives were satisfied and left.</p>
<p>Opening Up the Hushan Road Residential Area</p>
<p>Chen Fulin, the director of the County Construction Bureau, believes that the Hushan Road starts from the north line, passes through Liyuan, Baojie Bridge East Pier, Gao Chedu, Huangshi Zhu, Ye Miao Tan, Xiao Xuan, Da Xuan, Zhenshan Port, and reaches Dong Guan She, totaling seven kilometers. The mountain and lake views along the line are excellent, and it is conveniently connected to the Yangxi Kaiyuan area. He advocates opening up a residential area, collecting 550 mu of farmland within 60 meters north of the road line. After sorting and dividing the area, he will widely solicit merchants and banks to invest in real estate. Assuming that the price of farmland collected averages 200 yuan per mu, and the selling price averages 400 yuan, the total benefit from collecting farmland can be 110,000 yuan, which will be used to build eight bridges on the north line. Once the plan is ready, it must be submitted to the government for approval.</p>
<p>Implementing Joint Guarantee in Private Prostitution Areas</p>
<p>County Magistrate Wang Baoxuan believes that private prostitutes are gathered in the Jiuchengli and Minshengli areas of Tonghan Town, Bajian Tou, Xicunli and Changkangli of Zhongcang Town, Heleli Taiping Lane and Dongxin Road of Huishan Town, and Zhoushanbang in the first district. Bad people often mix among them. The future of public security is greatly affected and should be strictly guarded against to maintain security. In addition to ordering the Public Security Bureau to strictly prohibit it, he also instructed Qian Zhongliang, the head of the first district, to immediately supervise and instruct the town chiefs and Baojia chiefs to pay close attention and implement the joint guarantee in accordance with the regulations listed in Article 27 of the Baojia Regulations, and not to be negligent.</p>
<p>Requesting Exemption from Long-Distance Telephone Surcharge</p>
<p>The Wuxi County Chamber of Commerce reported that the Suzhou-Zhejiang-Anhui three-province long-distance telephone has revised its regulations. From September 1st, the call time will be changed from five minutes to three minutes per call. Although the fee per unit seems to be reduced, the actual increase is very large, causing public panic. They requested that the order be withdrawn to maintain public use. They immediately reported the situation to the Ministry of Transportation and asked for approval to maintain the old state to maintain public use.</p>
<p>Changzhou: Refugee Disturbance Occurs in the Eastern Suburbs</p>
<p>At about 9 AM on the 20th, a large number of refugees from Hunan suddenly came to the Xujiatang area of Huayan Township outside Wuyi County's East Gate. They gathered at the house of Xu Guihong, the head of Qingji Township, demanding and harassing everything. The villagers were panicked and the order was disrupted. Later, the police from the East Team and the First Branch of the Public Security Bureau rushed to suppress the situation, and the refugees fled to the Yantou Bridge area. After the inspection, dozens of dollars and sundry items were lost from the houses of Xu Township Chief and others.</p>
<p>Nantong: Dispute over Two National Products Exhibitions</p>
<p>More than forty manufacturers in Shanghai organized the Nantong National Products Exhibition and displayed their products in the Zhongxin Hotel in the West Park.

<p>Archbishop Cai Ning of the Roman Curia arrived in Tong on the 20th on the Zhidai ship of the Datong Shipping Company from Shanghai. On the 21st and 22nd, he inspected the religious affairs of Nantong Haimen.</p>
<p>Yangzhou: County Government Strictly Urges Clearance of Land Tax</p>
<p>The County Government was ordered by the Provincial Government to clear all the land taxes for the 23rd year by the end of August, and all overdue cases will be submitted for prosecution and rent sealing. It has been announced to the public. Now that August has passed, there are still many unpaid grains and taxes. Now, another announcement is issued to urge completion of payment, and each district is instructed to forward it to the townships and Baojia for posting, and the district officials are instructed to supervise the township chiefs to urge the township Ding to collect them with gongs. They are ordered to clear all the land taxes owed under their names in the 23rd year by the end of September. Those who have paid some of the grain and taxes but have not obtained a serial number, or those who have paid all the grain and taxes but have not obtained a serial number, should obtain a serial number in September and keep their lives safe. Those who do not have a serial number after the deadline will be ordered to make up for it and must not use the grain book as an excuse to prevaricate. If they wait and delay arbitrarily, they will implement the provincial order to collect rent and seal the property to offset the outstanding taxes, and the results of this urging will be used to assess the ability of the township chiefs and Baojia chiefs in each district.</p>
<p>Hangzhou: Competition between Highway and Railway Business</p>
<p>The Changyu and Guangyu highways on the Zhejiang-Jiangxi border have been jointly operated by the Commercial Highway Company and the Zhejiang Provincial Highway Bureau. It is only separated from Shangrao by a river, and the distance is no more than 90 miles. The Guangrao highway has also been completed and opened to traffic. Recently, with the opening of the Nanyu section of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway to Shangrao, commercial freight has undergone a change in business competition. As a result of consultations between the Commercial Company and the Zhejiang Highway Bureau, it was decided to appropriately reduce freight rates for downstream goods. From Guangfeng to Maojiaban, all goods will be charged at 80% of the previous price. From Maojiabo to Guangfeng, except for flour, cakes, and rice, which are priced at a special 90%, the remaining goods will be transported at the original price.</p>
<p>600,000 Autumn Cocoon Loan Fully Cleared</p>
<p>The autumn fresh cocoons in various districts of Zhejiang Province have been opened one after another. Due to the influence of the weather, the silk reeling rate reached 450 hands. The Department of Construction borrowed 600,000 yuan from ten banks in Shanghai to purchase high-quality seed cocoons to reel high-uniformity raw silk. Now that purchases have reached the peak period, the 600,000 yuan has been fully withdrawn from the Hangzhou Bank of China, which is acting as the custodian of the loan, and distributed to various districts to meet the needs of cocoon collection, which is expected to end by the end of this month. More than 60,000 late autumn seeds have been transported and will be distributed by each county for breeding starting today (the 22nd).</p>
<p>Ningbo: New Cixi County Magistrate Takes Office</p>

<h3>President Sun Arrives in Shanghai Talks</h3>
<p>League of Nations Executive Council Member's Gains and Losses Are Irrelevant to Our Country</p>
<p>Central News Agency reported that Sun Ke, President of the Legislative Yuan, left Beijing by night train the night before last night and arrived at Zhenru at 7:10 AM yesterday morning. He went directly to his private residence on Columbia Road to rest. He then met with news reporters in the afternoon and issued the following remarks:</p>
<p>The League of Nations Executive Council Member is Insignificant</p>
<p>Our country's request to join the League of Nations Executive Council this time was unsuccessful. I think this is irrelevant and not worth mentioning. Because the League of Nations is actually a European League of Nations, it has no time to care about Far Eastern events. And our country cannot take care of itself and has no power to take care of European events. Therefore, our country cannot help the League of Nations, and the League of Nations cannot benefit our country. Participation or not is insignificant. This failure to be elected as a member of the League of Nations Executive Council is not worth mentioning.</p>
<p>The Fifth National Congress Will Be Held as Scheduled</p>
<p>The Fifth National Congress will be held as scheduled and will not be postponed. The sincerity of the Southwest in supporting the Central Government is as it was in the past. Huang Jilu came north this time to exchange private opinions. I will meet with him. The issue of the term of office of the President of the National Government will be discussed after the Fifth National Congress.</p>
<p>The Revision of the Publication Law Will Be Reviewed</p>
<p>Regarding the revision of the Publication Law, the Central Political Committee has accepted the opinions of the press and has handed it over to the Executive Yuan for revision. Once the revision is completed, it will be passed by the Central Political Committee and then submitted to the Legislative Yuan for review. Sir Ross came to China this time under the order of the British government to investigate the economic situation.</p>
<h3>Commemoration of the Martyrdom of Mr. Zhu Zhixin</h3>
<p>Representatives from All Walks of Life Met Yesterday, with Over a Hundred Attendees</p>
<p>September 21st is the anniversary of the martyrdom of the late Mr. Zhu Zhixin. The city party headquarters of this city specially convened representatives from all walks of life in this city at 9:00 AM to hold the 15th anniversary memorial meeting. Wang Manyun, member of the city party headquarters, Yu Yaoqiu of the City Federation of Trade Unions, Yu Zhenhui of the City Farmers' Association, Xu Jun of the Jiangsu Fellow Association, Huang Xianggu of the United Federation of Citizens of the Second Special District, Zhang Lichun of the City Education Association, Zhao Zhenhui of the Pharmaceutical Industry Union, Du Mengsen of the Cooperative Undertakings Promotion Association, and more than one hundred representatives from various schools and party headquarters at all levels were present.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report</p>
<p>After performing the ceremony as usual, Chairman Wang Manyun first reported, saying briefly: Today is the 15th anniversary of the martyrdom of the late Mr. Zhu Zhixin. Mr. Zhu's life was loyal to the party, sincere and simple, and he studied diligently. Therefore, Mr. Zhu was really the pillar of the party and the country at that time. At that time, Mr. Zhu saw the rampant warlords in the country and the people suffered. So, in Guangdong, the source of the revolution, he followed President Sun and led revolutionary comrades to deal with the warlords. Unfortunately, Mr. Zhu was hated by the counter-revolutionary forces and died for the country. It has been fifteen years now. In these fifteen years, although the revolutionary forces have expanded to the whole country, foreign aggression has become even worse, and the internal communists have not been completely eliminated. We must follow the spirit of the late Mr. Zhu and fight these revolutionary enemies to the end, so that the revolutionary forces can have a solid foundation and realize the purpose of the revolution in the near future.</p>
<p>Memorial Slogans</p>
<p>(1) Mr. Zhu Zhixin's spirit is immortal. (2) Inherit Mr. Zhu's spirit. (3) Emulate Mr. Zhu's personality. (4) Work hard to suppress the communists. (5) Strive to carry out production and construction. (6) Implement the New Life Movement. (7) Long live the Chinese Kuomintang. (8) Long live the Republic of China.</p>
<h3>Loan Committee Plans: Factory Operation Loans; Plans to Allocate 3 Million Yuan for Handling</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Industry and Commerce Loan Examination Committee held a meeting the other day to continue reviewing credit small loans, passing more than 20,000 yuan. It was also proposed to allocate 3 million yuan to handle mortgage loans for the operation of national product factories, and Chairman Cai Zengji was recommended to formulate measures, which will be submitted to the meeting for discussion and then submitted to the Ministry of Finance for approval and implementation.</p>
<p>Continuing to Approve and Release Credit Loans</p>
<p>The Loan Committee held its twelfth meeting at the China National Products Bank at 4:00 PM on the 20th. The attending members were Cai Zengji, Qin Runqing, Chen Guangfu, Song Ziliang, Wang Xiaozhi, Bei Songsun, Du Yuesheng, Xi Demao (Bei Dai), Wang Yansong, etc. Chairman Cai Zengji submitted 39 applications for credit small loans and reviewed them case by case. As a result, it was decided to lend to 13 companies, approve half loans to 12 companies, reduce the amount of loans to 11 companies, and reject loans to 3 companies, totaling 25,550 yuan. It is said that the approved households will be notified by the association to go to the bank to sign and receive the money, and those who are rejected will also be notified by letter. The reason for the rejection is that the goods sold are not national products, or the store already intends to call the plate, and another company is engaged in the entertainment industry, which the association believes is inconsistent with the purpose of relief, so it is rejected. Also, since the association submitted an application to the Ministry of Finance to implement the transportation credit loan guarantee measures, changed to one store guarantee, and allowed member stores of the same industry association to apply for small loans with a chain guarantee, it has been quite convenient for the borrowers. It is said that more than 170 member stores of the noodle industry association have prepared application forms and submitted them to the association for summary and processing. According to the person in charge of the association, if business firms and factories need to borrow money and do not know the procedures, they can contact the association's office on the third floor of the China National Products Bank at the intersection of Tianjin Road and Henan Road, and ask for the regulations.</p>
<p>Planning Factory Operation Loans</p>
<p>The association believes that the credit small loans have been open for nearly two months, and although the association has submitted an application to the Ministry of Finance for special flexible guarantee measures, which are more beneficial than bank loans, only 162 households have been released so far, with a total of 127,000 yuan. Therefore, in order to change the loan policy and actively popularize relief, at the meeting the other day, Song Ziliang, Du Yuesheng, Bei Songsun, Qin Runqing, Cai Zengji, and other members unanimously proposed that a considerable amount be allocated from the credit small loan items recognized by various silver companies to be used as mortgage loans for the operation of national product factories, so as to help the industry, encourage production, and maintain the lives of workers. It was decided to allocate 3 million yuan as mortgage loans for factory operation, and Chairman Cai, Member Zengji was recommended to formulate detailed measures, which will be submitted to the 13th meeting next Friday for discussion and then submitted to the ministry for approval and implementation. According to Cai, the measures for mortgage loans for factory operation will be drafted soon. In order to make the implementation of these measures appropriate, the opinions of all parties will be adopted as much as possible. If business firms and industrialists in this city have any opinions, they can submit them to the association in writing within five days (before next Thursday) for reference.</p>
<h3>Industry and Commerce Revitalization Association Actively Conducts Investigations; Holds Public Lectures Today</h3>

<h3>Ministry of Industry and Commerce's Directive: Penalties for Businesses Not Joining Trade Associations</h3>
<p>Companies and Firms Must Join Trade Associations / Otherwise, the Articles of Association May Prescribe Disciplinary Measures</p>
<p>The Ministry of Industry and Commerce issued Directive No. 37480 regarding the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce's request for supplementary measures to compel businesses in the same industry to join trade associations. The directive stated, "Having read the report, the Ministry previously issued clear instructions in Directive No. 29209 regarding the relationship between companies and firms and trade associations. Since Article 7 of the Law on Trade Associations of Industry and Commerce stipulates that all should be members, it is a natural interpretation that all companies and firms in the same industry cannot be exempted from their membership obligations. Furthermore, Article 4, Item 7 of the same law allows for other disciplinary measures in addition to expulsion for those who violate the articles of association. Therefore, disciplinary measures can be pre-determined in the articles of association for those who do not fulfill their membership obligations, as long as the disciplinary measures do not violate the law. The Ministry previously approved the articles of association of the Qing Brick and Tile Trade Association in Hankou, Hubei Province, which stipulated a penalty for members who fail to pay membership fees, and when suing in court for the payment of membership fees, the payment of the penalty can be sued for in the same case. As for those who do not pay membership fees, civil or expedited procedures can be followed, as the Judicial Yuan has already interpreted. Therefore, although the Law on Trade Associations and its implementing regulations do not contain the provisions requested by the Chamber of Commerce, there are already concrete measures in place. The court will not refuse to accept cases based on the clearly defined penalties in the Civil Code and the various procedures interpreted by the Judicial Yuan, and there is no need to seek a separate legal basis. The proposal to request supplementary measures in the Law on Trade Associations should not be discussed. Let it be known." This directive.</p>
<h3>The "Baofeng" Steamer Returns to Shanghai Yesterday After Being Robbed at Sea</h3>
<p>Two Policemen and One Passenger Killed / Twelve Hours of Search and Robbery / Continues Export Operations as Usual Yesterday</p>
<p>The "Baofeng" steamer of the Jufeng Company set sail at 5:00 PM on the 19th. At the time of departure, twelve bandits disguised as passengers in short coats boarded the ship and scattered throughout the steerage cabins. According to the crew, the bandits spoke in Shanghai and Ningbo dialects and were all strong young men, each carrying a handgun.</p>
<p>Three Killed</p>
<p>At 6:56, the ship had cleared the Wusongkou (mouth of the Whangpoo River). By 7:10, when the ship arrived at Baoshan, the bandits seized the opportunity to sneak out of the steerage cabins. One group entered the pilothouse and coerced the captain, Xue Jinlong, into watching over them. Another group went straight to the main dining room. Because Wang Panjin, a patrolman of the 11th Detachment of the 3rd District of the Jiangsu Water Police, was in the main dining room with a Mauser pistol, and Liu Huaiqing, a patrolman of the Shanghai Public Security Bureau, was also present, the bandits feared resistance from the two policemen during the robbery. Therefore, they took action first. The bandits suddenly arrived in front of the two policemen, drew their guns, and fired wildly, firing more than ten bullets. The two policemen were caught off guard and fell into the cabin, hit by bullets. A passenger named Ji from the Mao Zhentai Xinhang flower shop in Haimen was also shot.</p>
<p>Three Passengers Wounded</p>
<p>Bullets flew everywhere for a time. All the passengers on board were unaware that it was a robbery. However, when the policemen were shot, one bandit waved his gun wildly, causing stray bullets to fly. Three passengers, Jin Shizhen, Zhu Xiexing, and Lu Zhongyi, were all hit by stray bullets and wounded. At this point, all the passengers on the ship were shocked and terrified, cowering in the cabin, afraid to breathe. There were also more than a dozen holes in the main dining room caused by stray bullets. After the bandits used guns to subdue the passengers, they went to the accounting room and detained the crew to start the robbery.</p>
<p>Forced to Head East</p>
<p>The captain was coerced by the bandits to change direction and turn the ship eastward. It was already about 6:00 AM on the 20th when they sailed directly towards the Tongsha waters. At 8:00 AM, they arrived at the Xiangshan waters in Zhejiang Province. The bandits ordered Captain Xue to stop the ship.</p>
<p>All-Night Search and Robbery</p>
<p>While the "Baofeng" was changing direction to the east, the bandits detained all the crew members in the accounting room. First, they forced the accountant to take out the books and ledgers in the accounting room for the bandits to view in order to search for money. Passenger luggage containing 10,700 yuan in banknotes, along with more than 800 yuan in cash from the accounting room and the crew, were all looted. Later, they separately searched more than 500 passengers. From 8:00 PM on the 19th to 8:00 AM on the 20th, the search and robbery lasted a total of twelve hours. Passengers also lost more than 10,000 yuan in cash, small silver coins, valuable jewelry, silk clothes, and other items. These were temporarily piled up in the main dining room.</p>
<p>Bodies Thrown into the Sea</p>
<p>When the ship arrived in the Daji waters, the bandits took the bodies of Liu Huaiqing, the Shanghai Public Security Bureau policeman who had died in the main dining room, and Mr. Ji, a cotton merchant from Haimen Maozhen, to the deck and threw them into the sea. Wang Panjin, the Jiangsu Water Police, was found dead, and his Mauser pistol was taken by the bandits. His body remained on the ship. As for the three marine police officers on board during the robbery, they were not harmed by the bandits because they did not carry firearms. They were only beaten by the bandits. In addition, no crew members or passengers were injured.</p>
<p>Looted and Fled</p>
<p>When the "Baofeng" arrived in the Xiangshan waters, a place called Denglong Mountain, the bandits ordered the ship to stop. They then seized a fishing boat on the sea and forced the crew to lower a sampan to transport the loot. The twelve bandits also left the ship one by one and boarded the fishing boat. Fearing any accidents, the bandits forced the ship's pilot, comprador, and accountant to get on the sampan and follow the fishing boat to the shore. There, they unloaded the stolen goods and fled. After the bandits left, the crew returned to the ship by sampan. It was already 9:00 AM on the 20th. When the bandits went ashore, they changed into the long robes and mandarin jackets they had stolen, completely changing their appearance.</p>
<p>Difficult Journey Back to Shanghai</p>
<p>At 9:35, the captain repaired the engine and started to turn back to Shanghai from Xiangshan. At 11:45 that night, they arrived at Wusong. At 1:50 AM yesterday morning, they entered the port late at night and docked at Pier No. 8 in Nanshi. The injured passengers, Lu Zhongyi and Zhu Xiexing, were rushed to Nanyang Hospital in Xiaodongmen for treatment. Jin Shizhen was sent to Qu Zhifu Hospital for treatment. As for the passengers on board, most of them will take the original ship to Haiqi. However, their luggage and travel expenses have been looted. Some went to relatives and friends after arriving in Shanghai, while others remained on the ship and did not disembark.</p>
<p>Normal Operation</p>
<p>Yesterday, when various authorities heard that the "Baofeng" had arrived in Shanghai, they went to the company to inquire about the truth of the robbery. The captain of the ship reported the details to the company. Jufeng Company reported the case to the Jianghai Customs, the Maritime Administration, and the Water and Land Public Security Bureau. At the same time, because the body of Wang Panjin, the water police officer who was killed during the robbery, was still on board, it was necessary for the local court to send personnel to inspect the ship. The "Baofeng" is now able to operate as usual because there is no major damage to the ship. The main dining room was slightly damaged by stray bullets and can be repaired soon. It exported at 5:00 PM yesterday.</p>
<p>Request for Arrest of Bandits</p>
<p>The Shanghai company has submitted a report to the Naval Headquarters, the Coastal Defense Command, the Shanghai Shiliupu Public Security Sub-bureau, the Dongjiadu Water Police Team, the Jianghai Customs, and the Shanghai Maritime Administration of the Ministry of Communications: "Respectfully submitted: Our company's "Baofeng" steamer was robbed at sea. The report has been submitted for your review. This morning at 1:35, the "Baofeng" steamer returned to the Dada Pier. The crew reported that at 5:12 PM on the day before yesterday (i.e., the 19th), the "Baofeng" ship left the port and sailed out. At 7:11, when sailing outside Wusongkou, in the Doushan waters, gunshots were suddenly heard in the No. 2 Galley and throughout the ship. The bandits took control of the pilothouse and steered the ship themselves, turning it south. They went to the accounting room, looting silver dollars, clothes, and other items, and searched the passengers' silver dollars and clothes. At 8:43 AM on the 20th, when the ship arrived in the Xiangshan waters, the bandits robbed a fishing boat and rode away. Before leaving, they forced the sailors to lower a sampan from the ship and took the comprador and pilot with them. After sailing near the shore, they were released, and the sampan, along with the comprador and pilot, returned to the ship. They weighed anchor and started the engine to return at 9:35. It was then inspected that Wang Panjin, a police officer of the 11th Detachment of the 3rd District of the Jiangsu Provincial Water Public Security Bureau, was killed by gunshots. Passengers Jin Shizhen, Zhu Xiexing, Lu Zhongyi, and other three were shot. According to the passengers, Liu Huaiqing, a policeman of the Shanghai Public Security Bureau, and Mr. Ji, a clerk from the Haimen Maozhen Taixinhang store, were shot and thrown into the sea. All the silver dollars and clothes of the accounting room and passengers were looted. The steamer sailed into Wusong at 11:40 PM and arrived in port at 1:35 this morning. We hereby report the details of the robbery on board for your review, and request that you strictly apprehend the bandits and bring them to justice to reassure travelers and curb the banditry. It is for the benefit. Sincerely submitted."</p>
<h3>Xintong Bank Suspends Operations Yesterday Morning / Small Scope of Business Does Not Affect the Market</h3>
<p>According to Xin Sheng News Agency, Xintong Commercial Savings Bank was affected by the economic recession and became unable to operate, and announced a temporary suspension of business yesterday. It entrusted lawyer Wu Guochang and accountant Zhao Zuwei to temporarily seal the books, and then convened a shareholders' meeting to decide on the aftermath. The total amount of deposits is about 110,000 yuan, and the amount of loans exceeds the total amount of deposits. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>History of Xintong</p>
<p>Xintong Bank, located at 519 Henan Road, was established in December of the tenth year of the Republic of China (1921), and registered with the government in the eleventh year and the seventeenth year of the Republic of China. The registered capital is 500,000 yuan in national currency, and the business types have been fully paid, including all commercial savings bank businesses. The manager is Chen Heting, and the chairman of the board is Xie Boshu. During the Shanghai War, it was once stranded, but the directors managed to resume normal operations. Now, due to the impact of the economic recession, loans are difficult to recover, deposits are withdrawn one after another, and at the same time, real estate operations are stagnant, resulting in a lack of cash flow. After deliberation by the board of directors, it was decided to suspend operations and liquidate.</p>
<p>Announcement of Suspension of Business</p>
<p>A notice was posted at the entrance of the bank by lawyer Wu Guochang and accountant Zhao Zuwei, representing Xintong Bank, announcing the temporary suspension of business. The notice stated: "It is hereby announced that Chairman Xie Boshu of Xintong Bank stated that the bank was affected by the recession, resulting in poor turnover and inability to maintain operations. It was forced to temporarily suspend operations to seek a solution. In addition to convening a shareholders' meeting to discuss solutions, we request representatives to announce this and preserve all books for liquidation. Based on this, we hereby announce that the business will be temporarily suspended from today. All books of the bank will also be transferred to the custody of this lawyer and accountant on the same day. In addition to publishing in the newspaper, this notice is hereby issued. September 21st."</p>
<p>Sealing of Books</p>
<p>Lawyer Wu Guochang, together with accountant Zhao Zhiwei, went to the bank on Beijing Road at 8:00 AM yesterday and temporarily sealed all books. It is heard that the bank's usual business scope is very small, so this suspension of business has no impact on the market. The total amount of fixed and current deposits in the savings department is about 80,000 to 90,000 yuan, but in accordance with the Savings Bank Law, one-quarter of the total amount of deposits has been deposited with the special custody committee of the Central Bank as a reserve. The current account department has about 20,000 to 30,000 yuan, with a total of more than 150,000 yuan in funds, exceeding the total amount of deposits, but due to the temporary inability to recover, it had to suspend operations.</p>
<p>Meeting for Aftermath</p>
<p>Xin Sheng News Agency reporters learned from the banking industry yesterday that the bank is not a member bank of the Banking Association, a member bank of the Banking Joint Reserve Committee, or an exchange bank of the Banking Instruments Exchange. Now all the books have been sealed by lawyers and accountants, and a temporary shareholders' meeting will be scheduled to decide on the aftermath. It is heard that the directors intend to carry out liquidation. After the shareholders' meeting approves, it will be implemented. The liquidators are also planning to entrust Wu Guochang and Zhao Zuwei, it is said.</p>

<h3>Repairing the Baoshan Seawall</h3>
<p>The Songkou Baoshan seawall starts from Changshu and is about 500 li (250 km) long, providing protection for the lives and property of more than ten coastal counties. The Baoshan section, in particular, is located at a crucial point in the Yangtze River and the sea and is extremely dangerous. The Jiangnan Water Conservancy Commission, in view of the severe floods in various provinces this year, is concerned that the dangerous works along the seawall may be flooded. Therefore, it immediately appointed Liu Yeqiu to Baoshan to oversee the repair work. An office has been set up and branch offices have been established in various sections to facilitate the progress of the work. It is understood that this repair work can be completed in about two months. As for the Tanjiabang section of the seawall in Wusong, although the Municipal Government has submitted a request for repairs, it is feared that it will be difficult to achieve due to funding constraints.</p>
<h3>This Newspaper Receives Flood Relief Donations Yesterday</h3>
<p>Yesterday (September 21), this newspaper received flood relief donations totaling 100 yuan from Mr. Liang Tangtang, 40 yuan from Mr. Liu Yunrong, 17 yuan and 6 jiao in small money donated jointly by the second-year students of the St. John's University School of Medicine, 16 yuan from the colleagues of the Dingxian Jincheng Bank, 10 yuan from an anonymous donor (receipt No. 11309), 5 yuan from an unnamed person (receipt No. 11307), 3 yuan from Mr. Chen Dajing of Suzhou, and 1 yuan from Mrs. Shen Zheng, for a total of 192 yuan and 6 jiao in small money.</p>
<h3>Flood Relief Fund: Generous Donations from All Quarters</h3>
<p>Han Fuju Cables Thanks for Medicine Donations; Taxpayers' Association Endorses Property Tax for Disaster Relief</p>
<p>The Shanghai Flood Relief Fund for various provinces in our city, since the start of soliciting donations and dispatching aid to various provinces, has received strong support from all quarters, so all kinds of work are proceeding very quickly. Mr. Xu Shiying, vice president of the association, recently left Shanghai for the Subei area to inspect the disaster situation and has already returned to Nanjing to report everything to the authorities. After discussing relief measures with Chairman Chen Guofu of Jiangsu Province, he will come to Shanghai to preside over all relief affairs. Chairman Han Fuju of Shandong Province yesterday cabled thanks to the relief fund for donating medicines. Donations from all quarters have also been very enthusiastic recently. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Shandong's Han Cables Thanks: Since the epidemic in Shandong Province became rampant last month and spread extremely rapidly, when Mr. Xu Shiying went north to survey the disaster and passed through Jinan, it was the beginning of the epidemic. Mr. Xu immediately telegraphed the Shanghai Flood Relief Fund for various provinces on Yunnan Road in this port to rush a large amount of first-aid medicines, packed in two large wooden boxes, and transport them to the Jinning Experimental Zone for effective implementation of relief. As a result, word-of-mouth praised it, and many people were saved. Now the association has received a cable of thanks from Chairman Han Fuju of Shandong Province, which reads: "Shanghai Flood Relief Fund for Various Provinces: Your letter has been received. Your association is concerned about the disaster victims and is raising funds for relief. Your previous donation of benevolent medicine has already been greatly appreciated. The additional precious medicine is even more admired. Fuju is in charge of the border area and shares the feelings of the common people. At this time of famine relief, I join the elders in singing your praises. In addition to handing over the medicines to the Yellow River Disaster Relief Association for distribution, I am replying and thanking you. Han Fuju bows and reports."</p>
<p>Friendly Voice Donates: The Friendly Voice Travel Group in this port, on Lloyd Road, held a disaster relief sports meeting at the Shen Garden on Jiaozhou Road on the 12th of this month to relieve the disaster victims in various places. All tickets were stamped by the Shanghai Flood Relief Fund for Various Provinces on Yunnan Road in this port to show prudence. Now that the disaster relief sports meeting of the group has ended, it has sent a letter to the Flood Relief Fund to check and receive the ticket proceeds of 633.4 yuan silver and the 52.3 yuan silver donated by the Jiaxing and Haining travel relief efforts of the group, which will be remitted to the disaster area for distribution. The contents of the two letters are extracted as follows: (1) "Respectfully, our group held this disaster relief sports meeting to mourn for the disaster victims and do our best. We are very grateful for your association's encouragement. After the closing ceremony, we immediately submitted 500 yuan of ticket proceeds, and we received a reply and a receipt in the file. Now that everything has ended, we continue to submit 133.4 yuan of ticket proceeds, as well as 1,613 two-cent tickets and 610 four-cent tickets. Please check and give us a receipt. Respectfully to the Flood Relief Fund for Various Provinces." (2) "Respectfully, our group, in view of the wide extent of the disaster areas and the severity of the disasters in the country this year, decided to collect an additional one-dime donation for disaster relief from group members when they register for travel starting on the 12th of this month to help with relief. Now we submit 27.4 yuan of additional donations for Jiaxing travel and 24.9 yuan of additional donations for Haining travel. Please check and give us separate receipts. Respectfully to the Flood Relief Fund for Various Provinces." It is evident that the group is righteous, eager to help the public, and benefits the disaster victims, which is admirable.</p>
<p>Donation of Songs: The Cooperation Publishing House, located at 4 Zhizhen Lane, Laoxue Father Road, in this port, specializes in publishing teaching materials for primary schools, such as model composition readers for senior primary school students, picture composition for junior primary school students, and music teaching materials for primary schools. The selection of materials is appropriate, and they are indeed excellent teaching materials for guiding primary school students in composition and music. Many primary schools in China use them as textbooks. Recently, in view of the severity of the floods in various provinces, the publishing house specially compiled and printed four or five kinds of new songs, such as "Begging Song" and "Disaster Victims," for the purpose of arousing national sympathy, which are completely free of charge and will be sent upon request. In order to expand publicity, the publishing house has not only sent the above-mentioned new songs in large quantities to the disaster relief associations to distribute to local education bureaus for singing in various schools, but also specially transferred them to several schools for students to sing, and plans to broadcast them on various radio stations free of charge on selected dates.</p>
<p>Property Tax for Disaster Relief: The Shanghai Flood Relief Fund for various provinces believes that the disaster situation in various places this year is extremely severe, with disaster areas covering more than ten provinces and tens of millions of disaster victims. Although all parties are enthusiastically donating funds for relief, it is ultimately a drop in the bucket. Therefore, it recently planned to organize a property tax donation for disaster relief in various special zones of the city. The president and vice president of the association jointly sent a letter to the Chinese Taxpayers' Association in the two concession areas, requesting unanimous support for early realization, and they have already received a reply of endorsement from the Chinese Taxpayers' Association in the Public Concession, which has been reported in various newspapers. It is heard that the association yesterday also received a reply from the Chinese Taxpayers' Association in the French Concession, stating that it should sincerely support the collection of property tax donations for disaster relief, and vigorously promote it to make it a success, and it can be seen that all sectors are generally enthusiastic about disaster relief.</p>
<p>Enthusiastic Donations: The Flood Relief Fund received 1,362 yuan from the Broadcasting Association for donations from 33 households of workers from the Baile Deng Company, Yao Da Erjie, You Huizhen, Miss Zhou, Li Haobo, Tong Ziqing, Rong Jingzhen, Rong Xinzhuang, and Hu Mengfeng. Mr. Wang Yiting received 270 yuan from 6 households, including Jia Guangsheng, Le Anmin, and Du Shengxing. Mr. Mao Ziyu received 30 yuan from an anonymous donor. There was also 700 yuan from the Baihua Relief Conference, 20 yuan each from Li Jun and Chen Ji, 5 yuan from an anonymous donor and Chen Yanbo, 140 yuan from 8 households, including Monk Xingzhi and Lu Xiuji of Putuo, received by Mr. Xu Zhijing. The Chinese Jisheng Association donated 1,000 yuan, Chen Feisheng 200 yuan, the Jincheng Industrial Society 20 yuan, Zhu Zan 10 yuan, Mr. Zou Runqing received 1,000 yuan from Keji, and 45 yuan from Yang Zhiting, etc. The Xu Mansion's funeral donation for disaster relief was 2,201 yuan from 46 households, including Gao Chichen, Lu Ziliang, Hu Zhong, Gong Xiling, Zhu Gengyu, Jiang Youting, He Shiqiu, Chen Buqing, Yin Ziyou, Geng Ziping, Cheng Zibin, and Guan Licheng. Mr. Lin Kanghou's funeral donation for disaster relief and the Northwest Problem Research Association received 60 yuan. Ye Liping, Zheng Juli, Zhu Zanyuan and other 11 households donated a car, 1,061 pieces of clothing, a cotton quilt, and 86 pairs of shoes and socks.</p>
<h3>International Trade Association: New Directors Held Meeting Yesterday; Elected Zhang Gongquan as Chairman; Plan to Form Sino-German Trade Association</h3>
<p>After the re-election of directors of the China International Trade Association, the new directors held a meeting at 12:15 p.m. yesterday in the meeting room on the fourth floor of the Hong Kong Road Bank Club.

<p>After the formalities were completed, the chairman first reported the results of the election of directors for this term and expressed his welcome to the new directors present. Then, Director Zhang reported on the establishment of the association and the general work of the past four years, saying that in the past, due to the lack of funds, many plans had not been implemented. Now, the members deeply feel that the work of the association needs to be actively carried out. After several discussions, various new plans and budgets have been reviewed, and in the future, it is planned to investigate the import and export of goods from France and Italy, conduct various investment studies, and organize trade associations between China and various countries, so that the association's research can meet the needs of China's international trade, so that the trade balance problem can be explored to its ultimate solution and remedial measures can be taken, and it still depends on the guidance and cooperation of various members and directors.</p>

<h3>Jiangsu Province: Third Shatian Bureau to be Established</h3>
<p>Since the Jiangsu Shatian official property was changed to provincial ownership in the 22nd year of the Republic of China, the Finance Department has set up 12 Shatian official property bureaus in various counties bordering rivers, seas, and lakes for management. Now, in order to unify powers and concentrate economic power, the provincial government has merged all valley bureaus into three Shatian bureaus. All Shatian official property affairs in 11 counties, including Shanghai, Dou, Song, Jin, Qing, Feng, Nan, Chuan, Chong, Qi, and Hai, are under the jurisdiction of the Third Shatian Bureau of Jiangsu Province. The new director, Guo Fupei, came to Shanghai on the 19th and has found the address of the bureau at No. 1, Baishou Lane, Penglai Road, Nanshi. It is heard that he will take over various bureaus and start working within days.</p>
<h3>Xi Dejiong to Take Office in Hankou</h3>
<p>The newly appointed Director of the Jianghan Engineering Bureau, Xi Dejiong, has arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing. Mr. Xi has private affairs in Shanghai that need to be handled urgently, so he plans to stay in Shanghai for one or two days. As soon as the arrangements are completed, he will take a riverboat from Shanghai, go up the Yangtze River to take office in Hankou. In recent days, friends of Mr. Xi have been holding banquets to see him off as he is about to leave Shanghai.</p>
<h3>National Postal Workers' Union Requests Postponement of Senior Postal Officer Examination</h3>
<p>Examination Regulations are Impractical; Announcement Period is Too Short and Does Not Comply with the Law</p>
<p>Since the Examination Yuan revised the Special Examination Regulations for Postal Personnel Examination and announced it on August 1, it was decided to hold the Senior Postal Officer Examination on November 1. The National Postal Workers' Union reviewed the content of the regulations and found that there were many impracticalities. Moreover, the holding of the Senior Postal Officer Examination is not what the postal service needs at present. According to Article 5 of the Implementation Rules of the Examination Law announced by the Examination Yuan, "When holding higher examinations and ordinary examinations, the examination types, regions, subjects, locations, and dates shall be announced by the Examination Yuan three months before the examination period." The date of the Senior Postal Officer Examination is only one month away from the date of announcement, which is not in accordance with the law. It is heard that the union believes that the implementation of the newly revised Special Examination Regulations for Postal Personnel Examination and the holding of the Senior Postal Officer Examination will have a significant impact on the future of the postal service. Therefore, it specially dispatched two standing committee members, Lu Jingshi and Zhu Xuefan, to Beijing with a petition to the Legislative Yuan, the Examination Yuan, the Ministry of Communications, and the Postal Administration to urgently present the advantages and disadvantages, appeal for improvement of the examination regulations, and postpone the holding of the Senior Postal Officer Examination. Their attitude is very firm and they will not stop until they achieve their goals. The petition of the union is extracted below: "Petition for the many impracticalities in the Special Examination Regulations for Postal Personnel Examination regarding the holding of the Senior Postal Officer Examination, requesting a temporary postponement of implementation and postponement of the event. We have investigated that the postal service has been established for more than 30 years, and the contributions of postal workers to the Postal Administration have been obvious. This is because both knowledge and experience are equally important, and it cannot be achieved by focusing on one. However, Article 4 of the Special Examination Regulations for Postal Personnel Examination announced on July 27 of this year regarding the Senior Postal Officer Examination focuses on knowledge alone. Its intention is to select talents for the country to serve the postal service, but in fact, this method is only superficial and has nothing to do with the needs of the postal service. The postal service, in addition to knowledge, especially values the richness of experience. Because of its deep accumulation, it is promoted to a corresponding position, or even the choice of a high-ranking postmaster or deputy postmaster is not easy. The current examination is tantamount to promoting a person with no postal experience to a high position, which will not only lead to a situation where people hold positions without doing any work, but also cut off the hearts of existing postal workers to work hard. It can be seen that those existing service personnel with knowledge and experience will all sigh and leave together. The impact on the future of the postal service is that our postal workers are not lacking in talents with special knowledge supplemented by rich experience, so there is no end to the selection of them. If you want to seek them from outside the Bureau, you only need to allow them to take the old examination for junior postal officers. After they enter the Bureau, after a considerable number of years, they can take the Bureau's senior postal officer selection examination. In this way, both experience and knowledge are available, which is better for the postal service and for talents. It is like graduates of specialized schools who still need to be sent to the designated agencies to undergo a considerable period of practice, which is exactly the same. Not to mention that our postal service does not have a specialized school. The Association deliberated repeatedly and after research by the local postal unions, believes that the examination is not suitable for the postal service and will waste the country's public funds. Therefore, we request to postpone the examination and formulate another method to hold the Senior Postal Officer Examination, which is specially for selecting existing postal workers within the Bureau, so that those with talent will be more motivated, and those who are low-level will be able to encourage themselves. On the one hand, when holding the Junior Postal Officer Examination, we will widely seek graduates from universities and vocational schools to participate in the examination. After passing the examination, they will be employed as B-level postal officers. Their treatment may be slightly higher than the starting salary of B-level postal officers, so that they can jointly plan the development of the postal service. Therefore, we urge you to examine, approve, and adopt our suggestion to postpone the examination and formulate another method. The future of the postal service depends on it. We are extremely grateful."</p>

<h3>Assassination Case on Nanshi Railway Station Road: Murderer Arrested; Hua Azeng Arrested Based on Deceased's Statement; Whether to Transfer Case Depends on Public Security Bureau's Document; Seemingly Arising from Struggle for Teahouse Leadership</h3>
<p>Yong native Pan Hesun, residing at No. 14, Furun Lane, Railway Station Road, Nanshi, in addition to opening a Lu Gaojian meat shop on Shanghai Minnan Zhelu Road, also contracted the southern teahouse of the Tianyun Building amusement park of Wing On Company. At 11:45 a.m. the other day, Pan Hesun was assassinated when returning home from the shop. He had just reached his doorstep when he was suddenly shot by thugs. The bullet hit Pan's chest. His family sent him to Shanghai Hospital for treatment, but the injury affected vital parts and he died late at night.</p>
<p>Pan's wife, Chen, suddenly reported to the Criminal Investigation Team of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, saying that her husband had stated at 2 p.m. in the hospital that the murderers were Hua Azeng, the owner of Hefeng Cigarette Paper Shop of the Xiyuan Melon Seed Company and the Yong native who was the overall contractor of the teahouse of Wing On Amusement Park, and his two apprentices, and called out the witness Hua Wenzhui to prove that he had also heard this statement at the time. Therefore, squad leader Gao Wansheng, criminal investigators Shen Jinqiu and Zhao Jinhui, together with Detective Wang Shusen of the Old Zha Police Station, rushed to No. 24 Guangxi Road at 3 a.m. and arrested Hua. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the First Criminal Court of the First Special District, where Judge Qian Hong presided over the interrogation. Hua Azeng also hired lawyers Xue Dubi and Yu Xiangqin to defend him. First, lawyer Jiang Baolian of the Police Station stated that this case was a request from the Public Security Bureau to assist in the arrest. Today, the Public Security Bureau has brought the victim's wife and witnesses to the case. Whether to approve the transfer should be decided by the court. Then, Gao Wansheng, the representative of the Public Security Bureau, submitted the case and requested a transfer. Due to the time constraints, the official document had not been prepared. The court then interrogated Pan Chen and Hua Wenzhui separately. According to Chen, when her husband said that he was murdered by Hua Azeng and his apprentices, only she and Hua Wenzhui were present and no one else heard it. Hua Wenzhui stated that he was hired by Pan Hesun as the</p>
<p>Yesterday, the teahouse leader of Wing On Amusement Park was reported by Pan's apprentice via Shanghai Hospital, confirming that he had heard Pan say that Hua had killed him. At the time, in addition to myself and Pan's wife, Pan's brother Helin and a female doctor had also heard it. Hua Azeng stated that tea customers of Wing On and Sincere Amusement Parks were all contracted by him. Later, through the introduction of Hua Wenzhui and a Rong, he subcontracted a part of Wing On to Pan. Recently, Hua and Rong had a dispute over the position of leader. He had mediated for them. Yesterday morning until noon, he was at home at No. 1000 Penglu counting accounts. There were witnesses who could prove it, so he was actually being falsely accused. His lawyer Xue Dubi immediately stated that the statements of the victim's wife and the witness Hua Wenzhui were completely inconsistent. According to them, the deceased made this statement at 2 p.m., at which time a doctor should have been invited to the scene for care to prove it, or immediately reported to the Public Security Bureau, but they did not do so until two hours after his death, which is suspicious. Judge Qian stated that since the official document of the Public Security Bureau had not yet arrived, whether to transfer the case should be decided after further studying the evidence. He then ordered the defendant to be returned to prison for another interrogation, and ordered the police station to assist in the investigation. If there was no relationship, he should immediately propose a release.</p>
<h3>Shanghai-Funing Direct Route Opened: Only 40 Hours via Sheyang River</h3>
<p>In order to develop the cultivation and facilitate commercial transportation in the Huaibei area, the China Union Dock and Warehouse Company, in addition to opening the Guanyun County to Shuikou route last autumn, also took the Sheyang River to trial-run a direct Shanghai to Funing route on August 22 of this year. It takes only 40 hours for exports from Shanghai to directly reach Funing City. According to the Sheyang River Estuary, due to the danger of the bar, no sea vessels have been involved. Therefore, passengers and goods in the Huaibei area, such as Funing, Yancheng, Batan, Dongkan, Donggou, Yilin, etc., are usually transferred by inland river boats to the ports of Tongzhou and other places on the Yangtze River Estuary and loaded onto wheels to be transported to Shanghai, which takes more than ten days. The high cost of transportation and the great loss are self-evident. Now, the company, with a spirit of fearlessness, has succeeded in surveying and measuring the direct Shanghai-Funing route after several investigations, which is a great benefit to agriculture in Huaibei. It is now heard that the company's Muyou vessel will officially set sail for Funing from the 26th of this month, and will also call at Xiangshuikou, tentatively running three shifts per month.</p>
<h3>Four Stores Liquidate Under the Cloud of Recession</h3>
<p>Amidst the voices of recession in the market, four major stores have announced liquidation. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Tianji Pharmacy: Tianji Bingji Pharmacy, located at No. 33 Fuzhou Road, has been open for 20 years. The owner, Li Liangxing, and the manager, Huang Bingji, usually had a fairly developed business. Recently, due to the impact of the recession, the business has plummeted, resulting in insufficient capital and inability to maintain it. Therefore, they hired lawyer Dong Yu as their representative to announce liquidation and issued a notice saying: "According to the manager of Tianji Pharmacy, this pharmacy has suffered huge losses over the years due to the impact of the recession, resulting in insufficient capital and inability to maintain it, and has had to announce liquidation. Please come to our office within ten days with your certificates to register. Those who fail to do so will be deemed to have voluntarily abandoned their rights. Those who owe money are also required to pay it in full to our law office within the deadline, otherwise they will be sued according to law. Please do not delay. This is a special notice."</p>
<p>Yuanxinchang Store: Yuanxinchang Silk and Cloth Store on Old Chongqing Road, established for 15 years, has also recently experienced insufficient capital and announced liquidation and a call for bids, and entrusted lawyer Gao Wenlin as its representative to issue a notice saying: "According to Qiu Yunzhang, the owner of Yuanxinchang Silk and Cloth Store on Old Chongqing Road, this store has been affected by the recession, resulting in insufficient capital and inability to maintain it. Please ask your lawyer to announce liquidation and call for bids. Accordingly, we are issuing a notice, hoping that all creditors will bring their certificates of debt to our office for registration within 14 days from the date of publication, so that we can verify them. Those who fail to do so will be deemed to have abandoned their rights.

We have specially entrusted your lawyer to announce liquidation to end the business. Accordingly, we are issuing a notice on behalf of the company, hoping that all creditors will bring their certificates to our office for registration within 14 days from the date of publication, otherwise they will be deemed to have abandoned their rights. Debtors are also requested to come to our office to pay off their debts within the above-mentioned period, so as to avoid being sued. This is a special notice on behalf of the company."</p>
<p>Fangquan Bathhouse: Lawyer Hu Minduo, representing Fangquan Bathhouse, announced the end of business and issued a notice saying: "According to Fang Dianjun, the manager of the above-mentioned bathhouse, the shareholders' meeting has resolved to close down and dissolve the business. Now all accounts have been cleared, and each share has a surplus of 53 yuan, 1 jiao, 1 fen, and 6 li. In addition to the shareholders using their share certificates to recover the remaining capital to end the business, we have specially entrusted the publication of a statement of closure. Accordingly, we are issuing a notice on behalf of the company."</p>
<h3>National Cigarette Exhibition Postponed: Datong Donates Champagne Brand; Datong Nanyang Huamei Fuxin and Hexing Donate Famous Cigarettes Daily; Chess Game at Final Stage, Special Fireworks Added Every Night</h3>
<p>The National Cigarette Exhibition held at the Great World in recent days, with its dazzling displays and wonderful entertainment, has created a new record for exhibitions. With the daily gift of cigarettes from each national cigarette factory, more than 100,000 visitors have attended, which can be called an unprecedented event. The expected exhibition period was ten days, and yesterday was the last day. The situation of Lixing Cigarette Company donating Coke cigarettes was still very lively. Now, the organizers, the China National Cigarette Maintenance Conference, have decided to extend the exhibition for four days, from today until the 25th.</p>
<p>Reasons for Extending the Exhibition: The decision to extend the exhibition for four days was made by the Standing Committee at the previous session. The main reasons are three: (1) The business of all national cigarettes has seen a significant improvement in the recent period, which is the effect of the association's widespread publicity. In order to lay the foundation, it is necessary to continue the exhibition. (2) The public chess final is still in the process of completing the final stage, and the success is bound to be extended. (3) Major cigarette factories have presented exquisite products to all sectors, and it is inevitable to have omissions due to the short period. For the sake of popularization, it is also necessary to extend the period.</p>
<p>One Pack of Famous Cigarettes per Person: During the four-day extension period, each national cigarette factory will continue to donate famous cigarettes with the Great World tickets. Today, Datong Cigarette Company will be on duty to donate Champagne brand cigarettes all day. The company has been established for many years. With the efforts of its General Manager Yan Huishou, Manager Sun Lishan, and Factory Director Yao Shushen, the business is very developed. The sales of Champagne brand cigarettes in the Yangtze River basin can be called second to none. It was originally planned to take turns to donate cigarettes on the eighth day to allow China-Philippines Cigarette Company to participate. In the next three days, Nanyang, Huamei, Fuxin, Hexing and other companies will donate famous cigarettes.</p>
<p>Key to Winning the Chess Game: Today is the last round of the chess competition, which is crucial. There will be a bloody battle. There are also chess masters Wu Song of Hubei and Lian Xuezheng of Fujian who have recently visited Shanghai. They have agreed to give public performances in the near future. It is a very grand occasion.</p>
<p>Fireworks Preview</p>
<p>During the four-day exhibition, in addition to striving for novelty, the participating manufacturers will add special fireworks every night to help with interest. The main programs are the Dragon Palace Birthday tonight, the Yellow Crane Tower tomorrow night, and Journey to the West the night after tomorrow. The skills of the famous craftsmen are a spectacle.</p>
<h3>The Honor of a British Boy Scout: Four Children Fell into the Water and He Rescued Them. International Committee Awards Medal of Bravery.</h3>
<p>British Boy Scout Clark, of the Shanghai Boy Scouts, was playing on a raft on the Huangpu River with six younger children a few months ago when a Chinese coolie suddenly jumped onto it, causing the raft to tilt and four children to fall into the water. The coolie swam ashore without offering assistance. Clark quickly held onto his brother and another young child to prevent them from also slipping into the water. He then devised a way to rescue the four children. His quick wit and composure were truly admirable. Later, Gordon, the acting commissioner of the Shanghai Boy Scouts, reported the incident to the London International Committee, which awarded him a Medal of Bravery and a certificate of commendation.

<h3>Huafeng Flour Company Dismissal Dispute: Ye Shantao and Others Sued by Workers; Xu Guannan Withdraws Shares, Lu Shaotang Flees; Only Ye Appears in Court to Explain Closure</h3>
<p>The Huafeng Flour Company was founded by Ye Shantao, Xu Guannan, and Lu Shaotang. Its flour mill was located on Xiaoshadu Road in western Shanghai. In March of this year, it declared bankruptcy and ceased operations. All of its more than 300 workers were initially not dismissed and remained in the factory, with Ye and others raising funds to provide food. In early August, Ye applied to the Social Affairs Bureau for permission to dismiss the workers in accordance with the Factory Act, but the workers still refused to leave the factory. Recently, Jiang Kaiyang, Sun Renping, Zhang Jifu, Wang Renkuan, Liu Guangfeng, Li Jinlin, Wang Shifu, Sun Liangchen, Zhang Yongmao, Li Yueqin, Du Jinhua, Zeng Zhaoyi, and twelve others jointly hired a lawyer to file a criminal self-accusation of embezzlement and breach of trust against Ye, Xu, and Lu. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Feng Shide of the First Special District Court convened a hearing. Defendant Lu Shaotang had already fled due to embezzling a large sum of money from the Exchange Bank, so only Ye Shantao appeared in court. Xu Guannan hired lawyers Chen Tingrui and Zhang Deze to represent him, stating that he had already withdrawn his shares and had never held a position in the company even before withdrawing, so the plaintiffs should not include Xu as a defendant. He is now ill and unable to appear in court. The court then ordered the plaintiffs to nominate Sun Renping to describe the facts of the lawsuit. According to Sun, the Huafeng factory was established in the 18th year [of the Republic, i.e. 1929] and had been profitable every year. On March 4 of this year, it suddenly stopped work and, when asked why, offered no answer. Subsequently, the Social Affairs Bureau convened a labor-management mediation. At that time, the defendant Ye Shantao, in addition to agreeing to pay the March wages, also promised to plan for resuming operations. All the workers were kept in the factory. Later, when asked about the resumption date, Ye always said he was preparing. Until May, it was heard that the factory's creditors would take over, and it was thought that work would resume. Unexpectedly, Ye, for his own benefit, ultimately made the resumption impossible and even cut off the workers' food supply on August 10. None of the settlement cases set by the Social Affairs Bureau were fulfilled. This is the course of his fraud. Furthermore, when the factory closed, there was a large amount of flour in stock, but after it was sold, the money was not paid to the workers as wages after March, but was all embezzled. The reason for the factory's closure this time was actually due to embezzling factory funds to be used as capital for private business, and when that business failed and there was no way to make up for it, the factory was sacrificed. Xu Guannan was indeed one of the shareholders. When the factory was previously sued by creditors, the court ruling also recognized that Xu was still a shareholder, etc. Questioned, the defendant Ye Shantao testified that Huafeng was originally founded by me, Xu, and Lu as partners. Lu was the general manager, but Xu withdrew his shares two years after the business started, and it became a partnership between me and Lu. I never asked about factory affairs. The year before last, there was a loss of 320,000, and last year there was a profit of 140,000. This spring, Lu fled because of a crime, and the factory could not be managed. However, because there was still a lot of wheat in stock, work continued until March 4, when it finally stopped. The flour produced was intended to pay off the debts of Dadezhuang. While it was being transported, the workers actually blocked it, so a request was made to the Social Affairs Bureau for mediation. The result was that the flour was still used to pay off debts and pay the workers' March wages. At that time, new shareholders intended to take over, so I kept the workers in the factory.</p>
<p>Raising food until the end of July, seeing no hope of resumption, I submitted a request and the Social Affairs Bureau approved the dismissal according to law, so the supply of food was stopped on August 12, and a notice was issued to pay one month's wages for dismissal. Unexpectedly, the workers unanimously resisted, and even their appeals to the Municipal Party Headquarters and the General Labor Union were rejected. These workers, on the 24th of last month, gathered hundreds of people and came to my house to make trouble. I reported it to the police station, resulting in a mutual [harm] incident. Two workers were injured, and one police officer was injured, etc. Sun Renping continued to say that dismissal according to law means that in addition to paying one month's wages, wages should also be paid for the anniversary days over the years when we did not stop work, but the defendant did not do so. The court then adjourned the hearing to the afternoon of next Saturday.</p>
<h3>Abuse of Adopted Daughter Incites Public Outrage: Adopted Daughter is Skin and Bones, Covered in Scars; Neighbors Write to Relief Society to Report to Police for Investigation</h3>
<p>Lv Nengquan, a dancer at the Shunfeng Dance Hall on North Sichuan Road, is nineteen years old and from Danyang. She lives with her sister, Lv Nengquan, in the front building at No. 140 Back Road. Last August, Lv Nengquan spent 16 yuan to buy Ding Gencheng's thirteen-year-old daughter, Ding Lansheng, in Danyang as an adopted daughter and brought her to Shanghai. However, Lv is inherently violent and has harsh methods. In name, she treats Lansheng as an adopted daughter, but in reality, she treats her as a servant. She makes her work tirelessly every day, does not feed her enough, does not clothe her warmly, and at night makes her sleep alone on the floor outside the door. If she does not do as she is told, she is whipped. The sound of crying is almost daily. Her neighbors and co-tenants, seeing the girl's unkempt hair, skin and bones, and body covered in scars, could not bear it, so they signed their names and wrote a letter to the Chinese Women and Children Relief Society to report and ask them to uphold humanitarianism and provide relief. The society sent investigator Chen Shaoting to report to the Zhabei Police Station. Yesterday morning, Chinese detective Wu Changkai was dispatched to No. 141 Back Road to arrest the sisters Lv Nengzong and Lv Nengquan, along with the girl Lansheng, and brought them all to the police station. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Eighth Criminal Division of the First Special Court. In addition to prosecuting them for abuse under Article 286 of the Criminal Law, police lawyer Zhang Tianyin also stated the above situation, saying that the girl Lansheng was sent to Guangren Hospital by the police station for examination yesterday. The doctor found that the child suffered from childhood tuberculosis and intestinal tuberculosis, and had many broken wounds on her legs. The police also investigated the defendants' neighbors, who all confirmed that they had indeed seen the defendants abuse her from time to time. Therefore, in addition to requesting punishment according to law, they also requested that the girl Lansheng be sent to the Relief Society for custody, etc. According to Lansheng's confession, she is twelve years old and her father's name is Ding Gencheng. They used to live in Dingjia Village, Danyang. Last year, her father brought her to Shanghai and sold her to the defendant as an adopted daughter. She calls Lv Nengquan "mother" and Lv Nengquan "aunt." There are no servants in the Lv family. All the work of washing clothes and soaking water is done by me. But my mother usually doesn't give me enough to eat. If I do something wrong, I will be beaten with firewood. My aunt sometimes hits me with her hands. I used to sleep on the same bed as my mother, but starting this year, I was ordered to sleep alone on the floor outside the door, etc. According to the three witnesses, the landlady Wang Sangshi, the co-tenant Li [surname] and the next-door neighbor Shi Youting, Lv Nengquan beats the girl every day as if it were a game, sometimes using iron [implements] to prick the girl's mouth and beat her painfully with firewood. We saw her pitiable, so we jointly reported it to the Relief Society, etc. Questioned, Lv Nengquan testified that Lansheng was bought by me from her father for twenty yuan for overseas travel as a daughter. Because her character is not good, I slightly intimidated her, but there was no beating. The injuries on her body were caused by falling from the stairs one day. Lv Nengquan said, "I sleep during the day and go out dancing at night. I didn't beat the girl." After the defendant's lawyer got up to argue, Judge Wu Zehan ordered Lv Nengquan to be returned to the women's prison and Lv Nengquan was allowed to leave on bail of 300 yuan, pending sentencing on the 24th. The girl Lansheng was sent to the Women and Children Relief Society for custody.</p>
<h3>Yi Fangshuo Acquitted: Still Posts Security During Appeal Period, Regains Freedom Yesterday Afternoon</h3>
<p>Yi Fangshuo, a comedian and troupe leader from Hangzhou, resident at No. 147 Baxianfangkou, Huage Road, French Concession, who performs comic opera at the rooftop garden of the New World Company, 44 years old this year, was reported to the French police on the morning of December 11 last year for the case of raping his cousin Yi Baozhu and disturbing public morals. Yi was arrested and sent to the Second Special Court for interrogation and detention. During the investigation, it was discovered that Yi had continuously raped his concubine Li Xiaozhen, bought women Yi Jinzhu and Yang Lingzhu to train in theater, and monitored their movements. After two trials, Yi Baozhu and Li Xiaozhen withdrew their charges on the disturbing public morals part. The police department then proceeded with the two parts of disrupting family freedom. As a result, Yi Fangshuo was sentenced to three years in prison for illegally depriving people of their freedom of movement. He appealed to the Third High Court, which changed the sentence to enslaving people, still with three years of imprisonment. Yi still refused to accept the verdict and appealed to the Supreme Court for final appeal. The judgment overturned the original verdict and sent the case back for retrial. The full text of the reason is as follows: "After reviewing the entire file, the appellant is engaged in singing opera and organizing opera troupes, which he does not deny that he accepts young girls as apprentices. However, teaching apprentices opera is not prohibited by law. If the apprentices' actions are restricted, it cannot be hastily pointed out that they are being enslaved unless there is inhumane treatment. According to the appellant's confession, Yi Jinzhu (i.e., Ye Jinzhu) was brought by a section chief. She often caused trouble at home. She fell from the drying platform and also fell from the Rongjin platform. I sent her to the hospital twice. When she came out, one person followed her. She was not taken care of at home. I was afraid that cars would hit her, so I had people follow her when she went out, etc., which is not unreasonable. Moreover, a maid cannot be determined to be a slave. Even if Ye Jinzhu was indeed a maid bought by Ye Li, the appellant only accepted her as an apprentice and taught her opera, which is even more difficult to point out as jointly enslaving people. The original trial's predetermined verdict is not enough to show conviction. The application of the law regarding the facts determined by the original judgment is also difficult to be appropriate. It should be considered that there is a reason for returning the case for retrial. Based on the above conclusions, the judgment should be made according to Articles 389 and 393 of the Criminal Procedure Law as in the main text." After the case was sent back, the Third High Court held a hearing a few days ago, summoning all the witnesses and ordering the appellant to be brought to the case. The retrial was declared concluded, and the date for sentencing was scheduled. All the details have been recorded in this newspaper. Yesterday was the date for sentencing. At 10:00 a.m., Judge Sun Honglin, the acting presiding judge of the Third High Court, accompanied by Judges Li Changnian and Wang Yue, together with Prosecutor Dong Qiming, specially opened the Third Criminal Division and ordered Yi Fangshuo to be brought to the case. After briefly asking his age and origin, the judgment was announced: the original judgment was overturned, and Yi Fangshuo was acquitted. After the judgment was completed, the official briefly explained the meaning and reasons of the judgment to Yi and informed him that the prosecutor and the police department of this court had not yet determined whether to appeal, and ordered him to submit a guarantee for future summons within the appeal period. After the instructions were completed, he withdrew from the court. Yi was immediately taken to the bail office by the bailiff to wait for bail and release. When the verdict was announced, Yi's family members, such as Yi's sister Yi Caitao, and many people from the entire Shanghai comic opera circle who came to the court to listen, were particularly numerous. His wife and concubines were all delighted when they heard the verdict of acquittal and the ruling to allow bail. When Yi exited the courtroom, they comforted him and went out to find a guarantor. Yi was arrested at noon on December 11 last year and has been detained in the detention center for a total of nine months and ten days until today's first trial verdict of acquittal and permission to post bail. The joy of Yi and his family, etc., upon regaining freedom can be imagined. A lewd case involving the collateral crime of obstructing freedom was thus declared over. At around 3:50 p.m., Yi's guarantor was finally found. After investigation by the court, Yi left the court at around 4:00 p.m. He did not go straight back to his residence at that time, but opened a room at No. 402, Oriental Hotel, Xizang Road. The New World Entertainment Department specially held a banquet that night, and it was heard that Yi will go to Hangzhou this afternoon and will continue to perform at New World Amusement Park from October 1.</p>
<h3>Wang Dekui Dies of Injuries: Succumbs at 7:20 Last Night, Body Sent to Morgue Awaiting Court Examination</h3>
<p>Wang Dekui (48 years old), a native of Yangzhou and chief inspector of a certain amusement park in the French Concession, was stabbed in two ribs with a sharp fruit knife by Wang Enrong, a Northern Chinese inspector who had already been suspended from his post, in front of the Da Jing opera troupe near the park at around 10 p.m. on the 19th (two days ago). The perpetrator was arrested on the spot, and Dekui was sent to Renji Hospital for treatment. After examination by the doctor at the time, it was said that Wang was injured in a vital spot, the wound was very deep, and there was excessive bleeding, and his life was in extreme danger, etc., which had been [recorded] in this newspaper. However, after Wang was admitted to the hospital, the doctor sutured the wound, and although he was conscious, he was unable to speak. His condition was still good, but after 5 p.m. yesterday, his condition suddenly deteriorated, his temperature increased, his pulse became abnormal, and his breathing became short. Although the doctor tried his best to rescue him, it was too late, and he finally died at 7:20 p.m. The hospital notified the police station, which in turn notified the Tongren Fuyuan Branch and ordered the mortuary workers to move the body to the morgue to await a report to the Second Special District Court for examination.</p>
<h3>Fire at a Reed Company in Tangqiao, Pudong: Nine Zinc-Roofed Warehouses Destroyed, Losses Including Goods Total Over 20,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>The Chinese Reed Company at No. 9 Ni [blank] Quan, north of Tangqiao, Pudong, has [rows] of warehouses built to the north of the factory, near Zhangjia Creek. The first [row] and the second [row] were nine zinc-roofed warehouses, the third [row], warehouse No. 1, was three tile-roofed bungalows, the fourth [row], warehouse No. 1, was five tile-roofed bungalows, and the fifth [row] (i.e., the southernmost one), warehouse No. 1, was three tile-roofed bungalows, totaling [20] ten rooms, all used for storing reed straw bales. At 2:45 p.m. yesterday, a fire suddenly broke out in [seven] rooms of a row of zinc-roofed houses along the creek. Because the stored reed straw bales were all flammable materials, they ignited immediately upon contact, and the raging flames soared, making them impossible to control. When factory employees saw the fire, they immediately reported it to the Tangqiao Police Station. Inspector Liu Ruhai and police chief Zhang Panchi were assigned to lead police to the scene to maintain order. At the same time, the fire departments were notified by telegram for assistance. Soon, Zhao Longsheng, director of the Pudong District Fire Brigade, and Shen Yu, executive committee member of the Yangjing District Fire Brigade, each drove fire trucks and led personnel to the scene to put out the fire. However, the fire was raging and could not be extinguished for a while. Before long, it spread to the second [row] of zinc [roofs], continuing to burn. Seeing the situation was bad, the firefighters quickly cut down and demolished the three tile-roofed warehouses of the third [row] with knives and axes, and also tried to move away flammable materials to isolate the fire. Only then were the last two [rows] of tile-roofed warehouses saved. The fire burned until 6 p.m., gradually weakening, but the internal flames were still raging. The firefighters continued to put out the fire to eliminate the root of the fire. In this fire, a total of nine zinc-roofed warehouses were destroyed and 3 [sic] tile-roofed warehouses were demolished. More than 2,000 bales of reeds were also burned. According to the company's estimate, the loss of buildings was about 2-3,000 yuan, and the loss of goods was more than 20,000 yuan. As for the cause of the fire, according to Mr. Zheng, the company's accountant, before the fire broke out, a wooden pier boat, after being repaired at a nearby shipyard, released firecrackers when leaving the dock. Because the firecrackers shot into the zinc-roofed warehouse and ignited the straw bales, no one noticed for a while, causing a prairie fire. Afterwards, the Tangqiao Police Station arrested a suspected boatman for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Autopsy of Chinese Constable's Suicide</h3>
<p>Fang Jinli, a 24-year-old Chinese constable from Henan, No. 64 of the Public Concession Police, suddenly went to an empty room No. 41 of the Beizhan Hotel at No. 43 Jielu at around 12 o'clock noon the day before yesterday while on duty, and shot himself in the head with his pistol, resulting in his death. All the details were recorded in yesterday's newspaper. Now, after investigation by the relevant police station, a strip of [paper] was found, only stating that his cousin Li Zunxi (who is currently a Chinese constable No. 5494 at the Yangshupu Police Station) should come, without any other words. It was also found that the deceased's family members are all in his hometown. The reason for his suicide this time is that he was ill from time to time, had too many leaves of absence, and also owed people more than one hundred yuan, which he could not repay. Apart from these two things, there is no other evidence. The body was moved to the [Lun] Road morgue. Yesterday, the First Special District Court sent Prosecutor Guo Wei to the morgue to examine the body. After the Western police chief reported the previous situation, Mr. Guo instructed that the deceased Fang Jinli, male, was confirmed to have died from a gunshot wound to the head during his lifetime. The body was handed over to the deceased's cousin Li Zunxi, who signed a guarantee to receive the body. A pocket watch, two corners, and ten [odd] copper coins left behind were also handed over to Li Zunxi in court to sign for.</p>

<h3>New China Bank Building Project: Old Building Except for Vaults to Be Demolished by End of Month, New Building Design to Be Similar in Height to Sassoon House</h3>

<p>Vaults Still Hold Much Silver: Because there is still a large amount of silver stored in the vaults of the old building, and there is no suitable place to relocate it, the Bank has negotiated with Xinrenji Construction Factory, the demolition contractor, to extend the deadline by half a year to wait for the western vaults of the new building to be completed and the silver to be moved into the old vaults before demolition.</p>
<p>Pile Driving to Be Bid Next Week: The design of the new building has been adopted from the design drawn by Gonghe Foreign Firm.

<h3>### Xinghua Restaurant Contracts for the Meals of the National Games Athletes</h3>
<p>The Sixth National Games will be held in the city center on October 10th. Athletes from various provinces and cities are enthusiastically coming to Shanghai to participate. The organizing committee is responsible for all hospitality. Since people from different provinces in our country have different dietary habits, the committee has been convening discussions with major restaurants in the city in recent days to discuss arrangements. However, due to the large number of tables and the limited scope, some restaurants were unable to handle the task. As a result, the Cantonese cuisine portion was contracted to the Xinghua Restaurant on Fourth Horse Road. The restaurant is magnificent and has a long history of 70 years. The delicacies it produces are well-regarded by all sectors. The restaurant is confident that it can handle this great banquet smoothly. Mr. Li Mancun of the restaurant went to the organizing committee yesterday to complete the procedures. He told reporters that Cantonese cuisine has been attracting attention from Chinese and foreigners in recent years, but unfortunately, there is no general understanding of its contents. To promote it widely, a cookbook will be compiled with Cantonese cuisine recipes and dish types, and will be distributed to athletes and people from all walks of life at that time. This is an unprecedented move. The book is comprehensive, covering all Cantonese dishes, with Chinese and Western translations, and detailed dish prices. This compilation will be very convenient for home banquets. It is also heard that the Song Sixty Famous Ci Collection will be published next week, and the Thirty-Six Marvelous Tales will be published on the 5th of next month, based on the Ming Dynasty edition, which is rare and valuable.</p>
<h3>### Hu Zimu, Angered by an Argument with a Colleague, Committed Suicide by Poison</h3>
<p>Hu Zimu, 44 years old, a resident of No. 197, Station Back Road, Nanshi, from Tonglu, Zhejiang, opened the Hu Yuantai Paper Shop on Station Road, Hu Min Nan Zhe Road. Because he had an argument with his colleague Zhou Guanhong, who lives at No. 267, Fang Xie Road, the day before yesterday, he was then beaten slightly in the face by Zhou. After returning home, he was extremely angry and had the idea of committing suicide. So, at 1:30 AM yesterday, he bought four jiao of opium and swallowed it secretly. His wife noticed and immediately sent him to Shanghai Hospital for treatment. However, due to excessive poisoning, the treatment was ineffective, and he died in the hospital at 9:30 AM yesterday morning. Subsequently, his family reported to the Station Road Police Station, and Patrolman Niu ordered the local guarantor to go to the court to report the death for inspection and to report it to the Ximen City Public Security Bureau for investigation. Zhou Guanhong, who had previously beaten him, was brought to the case for investigation.</p>
<h3>### Guo Chongshan, Shot During a Robbery, Died from His Injuries</h3>
<p>On the evening of the 11th of last month, at about 8:00 PM, four robbers broke into No. 478 Huade Road, Hudong, displayed pistols, and threatened the victim. They robbed him of 100 yuan in banknotes and fled. At that time, Guo Chongshan (27 years old), a ticket inspector from the Tram Company's No. 73, got off a trolleybus at the Huade Road, Jingzhou Road station. The robbers, seeing Guo wearing a uniform, mistook him for a policeman and shot Guo, hitting him in the back, penetrating his chest, and damaging his spine. Later, the police arrived, but the robbers had disappeared. They only took the injured man to Fumin Hospital for treatment. It is now known that Guo Chongshan, who had been treated in the hospital for more than a month, died of his injuries at 9:40 PM on the night before last (the 20th). The next morning, his body was taken to the China Funeral Home for burial.</p>
<h3>### Weng Daoliang Sentenced for Murder; Sentenced to Twelve Years of Imprisonment</h3>
<p>Weng Daoliang, a native of Yancheng, Jiangbei, who lived near the Nanhai Military Camp, was a laborer. He had a feud with his partner, Dong Erbao (also a laborer). They often clashed at work. On the 17th of last month, Weng and Dong had another argument over work, which led to a mutual brawl. At that time, Dong's stepfather, Dong Xiqi, happened to be relaxing and gambling in a small tea house nearby. Hearing the noise, he rushed out to mediate, but to no avail. He then helped his stepson Dong Erbao beat Weng. Because he was no match for four hands with his two fists, Weng was humiliated. Weng was unwilling to accept this and, somehow obtaining a sharp knife, stabbed Dong Xiqi in the abdomen. Dong Xiqi cried out and died instantly. Dong Erbao, seeing his stepfather die tragically, handed Weng over to the police. Weng was detained in the local court. Prosecutor Ouyang Shu inspected the body and questioned Weng Daoliang again, charging him with murder. Judge He opened a court session in the criminal division. According to Weng Daoliang's confession, the murder weapon was held by the deceased, who wanted to stab him in the thigh. He snatched it away and stabbed back, accidentally hitting his abdomen and causing death. He was detained pending sentencing. Yesterday, Judge He opened a court session and announced the verdict: Weng Daoliang is sentenced to twelve years of imprisonment for murder, and deprived of his civil rights for ten years. The murder weapon is confiscated. After the verdict was read, Weng was ordered to be returned to custody to await the appeal period before being sent to serve his sentence.</p>
<h3>### Careless Fire in a Straw House on Connaught Road</h3>
<p>Yesterday (the 20th) at 1:10 AM, a fire suddenly broke out in the straw house without a number plate inhabited by Hong Liang, a woman from Yancheng, Jiangbei, at the intersection of Connaught Road and Singapore Road, Shanghai West. Thick smoke quickly filled the area, and the flames soared into the sky. The Caojiadu Fire Brigade and the Jing'an Temple Fire Brigade arrived one after the other after receiving the alarm. However, the fire had already spread to the neighboring houses. After exhausting their efforts to put out the fire with water, it was extinguished after about an hour. A total of eighteen straw houses were burned down. The Caojiadu Sub-bureau sent police to suppress and maintain order at the time. The fire-starting woman, Hong Liang, was taken into custody and questioned.</p>
<h3>### Widening of the Railway Gate on Datong Road</h3>
<p>Datong Road in Zhabei, connecting the concession in the south and Luodian, Jiading, Liuhe, Baoshan, and other places in the north, has become an important thoroughfare for north-south traffic in recent years due to the popularity of long-distance buses and the increasing number of people and convenience of transportation. Recently, the Shanghai-Xiang special bus line also set up a station there, making the traffic even busier. However, the original railway gate there was narrow. Whenever a train passed and the gate was opened and closed, the crowd was crowded, and collisions often occurred, creating dangerous situations. The railway bureau, mindful of this, widened the gate yesterday, making it about ten zhang long from north to south and about five zhang wide from east to west, which is convenient for pedestrians.</p>
<h3>### Relocation of the Ant Society</h3>
<p>The Ant Society has been established for four years, and the number of members has increased to over five hundred, all of whom are enthusiastic participants in cultural movements. Therefore, the society's affairs are developing rapidly, and the original address is no longer sufficient. It has now moved to the third floor of No. 639 Sichuan Road (that is, the Quan De Pharmacy at the corner of Sichuan Road and Hong Kong Road). Those who wish to borrow books from the society's affiliated Ant Library can contact them there.</p>
<h3>### Publication of "Willow Pavilion Poetry Talks"; The Second Volume of the "Chinese Literature Rare Books Series"</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Magazine Company is publishing the "Chinese Literature Rare Books Series," with one volume published every Saturday starting from the 14th of this month. The second volume, "Willow Pavilion Poetry Talks," was published yesterday. There are no fewer than several dozen or hundreds of specialized books on poetry talks from past dynasties, but none are as erudite and profound as this book. The author, Song Changbai, was a person from the early Qing Dynasty. His "Poetry Talks" in thirty volumes covers everything from the Three Dynasties to the present, including poetry lines, poetic couplets, the forms and rules of poetry, the length of poetry, origins and names, and the number of schools. Every word and half-line has a basis. It truly deserves to be called a large dictionary of poetry. This book is not only essential for poets and lyricists, but anyone who browses through it will gain endless knowledge of Chinese classics. The series is based on the original Tianzhu Garden edition from the Kangxi period, making it truly precious. The entire book contains 600,000 words and over 720 pages. Due to insufficient printing, only the first volume is being released first, with the second volume to follow immediately. The retail price for the popular edition is 50 cents, and the special edition is 70 cents. If you pre-order all 50 volumes in this series before the end of this month, totaling 70 thick volumes, it will still cost 15 yuan. From the 1st of next month, the paper fee will increase by 2 yuan, averaging only 3 jiao per volume, which is extremely cheap. It is also heard that the "Song Sixty Famous Ci Collection, Volume A" will be published next week, and the "Thirty-Six Marvelous Tales" in thirty-six volumes will be published on the 5th of next month, printed based on the Ming Dynasty edition, which is rare and precious.</p>
<h3>### Weather Report</h3>
<p>The Xujiahui Observatory's weather forecast for 4:30 PM yesterday was: Shandong has clear skies with varying northwest to northeast winds. The middle reaches of the Yangtze River are cloudy with morning fog, and northeast to north winds are slight. The lower reaches of the Yangtze River are cloudy and overcast at times, with northeast winds. The East China Sea and Taiwan have slight north to east winds. This is due to a hurricane southeast of America's Keishima Island moving northwest-west or northwest. The Ryukyu Islands are surrounded by cyclones and the weather is bad. At 2:00 PM, the center of the hurricane was within about 60 miles of 22 degrees north latitude and 128 degrees east longitude, with strong winds. Also, in the 24 hours before 3:00 PM yesterday, the highest temperature in the city was 80.1 degrees and the lowest was 62.1 degrees.

<h3>### Letter to the Editor</h3>
<p>Dear Sir, according to a news item in the fourth page of your newspaper today, regarding a robbery at No. 15, Lai'an Fang, Xinzha Road, it is inconsistent with the facts. This house is my residence. Although at about 7:00 PM last night, four people who seemed like robbers came, each holding a pistol, they broke in through the back door, saw that the front door was wide open, and immediately left. It was not as the report said, that they were monitoring the men and women in the house, ransacking the boxes and cabinets, and looting in different directions, searching all the valuables, and escaping only after about half an hour. The robbers did not obtain anything at all, and I had no loss whatsoever. Originally, I did not intend to argue, but I fear that rumors will spread, and my relatives and friends will worry unnecessarily. If the facts are distorted, the police will waste their efforts investigating. Therefore, I am writing this letter to request a correction. Respectfully, The Resident of No. 15, Lai'an Fang, Xinzha Road. September 21st.</p>
<p>Having recently read the fourth page of your newspaper on September 21st, which contained a passage about "Taixing's Detained Local Wine Released on Bail, Wind of Suspension of Transportation Calms Down," there are many inconsistencies in the content. The wine merchant Yin Dianyuan, who was transporting local wine from Taiguang to Shanghai last month, was detained by the Shanghai Inspection Office of the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Regional Unified Tax Bureau. No "Shanghai Inspection Office" has been established under our bureau's affiliated agencies. The release on bail was also approved by the Tax Department after the Shanghai Inspection Office of the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Regional Unified Tax Bureau submitted a report. It was not the Tax Department that instructed our bureau to transfer it to the Hai Inspection Office for handling. As for the recorded comments, they are inconsistent with our bureau's instructions to Feng Zijing and other representatives of the Taixing Wine Industry Association stationed in Shanghai. Our bureau's original instructions were: "I have received the report. After investigating the case of Yin Dianyuan's detained local wine, the Shanghai Inspection Office had previously replied in a letter that it had been reported to the Tax Department for instructions. For the time being, permission was granted to release it on bail first, pending disposal." This was then forwarded to the bureau and replied to in accordance with the instructions of the Tax Department, regarding the standards for distinguishing between soaked wine and local shochu, and our bureau has successively requested the Tax Department to issue orders in the case. Please be informed accordingly," and so on. We hereby request that you investigate and make corrections. To the Shen Bao Newspaper, the Jiangsu Bureau of Seal, Tea, and Tobacco Tax of the Ministry of Finance. September 20th.</p>
<h3>Special Item; Opinions on the Issue of Increasing Chips</h3>
<p>The work plan of the Industry and Commerce Revival Committee was resolved at the first general meeting, starting with investigation, statistics, and training, and is being actively promoted. However, since all parties are deeply concerned about the depletion of chips, it is considered necessary to pay attention to this problem as a matter of urgency. In addition to the suggestion made by Committee Member Hu Xiyuan, Committee Member Chen Xiaodie drafted a rescue plan, advocating the issuance of corporate bonds to attract financial public bonds to maintain the critical situation. Therefore, the second general meeting resolved to organize a group meeting to discuss the issue. The discussion is now showing some results. The opinion letter is as follows.</p>
<p>1.  Payment Chips are Not Depleted</p>
<p>Chips are also called tools. The chips in the financial market are divided into two categories. The first is credit chips, that is, credit instruments, which are the targets of credit from the financial industry. Securities, bills, and so on belong to this category. The second is payment chips, that is, payment instruments, which are the means of final settlement of debts and claims. Coins and banknotes belong to this category. Currently, people generally talk about chips while neglecting the distinction between credit chips and payment chips. In fact, the difference between the two cannot be measured. The increase in credit chips is "credit expansion," while the increase in payment chips is "inflation."</p>
<p>The current difficulty in our country is a major question of whether it is a shortage of credit chips or a depletion of payment chips. On the surface, the deposit balance in Shanghai has dropped from 590 million yuan at the end of May last year to 330 million yuan at present. The loss amounts to 45%. The situation of payment chip reduction cannot be said to be not serious. However, from November of last year to the present, in the past nine months, the silver deposits have not continued to decrease. The serious period seems to have passed. Of these 337 million yuan of silver deposits, 298 million yuan belong to Chinese merchants. After allocating 60% of cash reserves for the issuance of banknotes, there is still ample surplus. It seems like an exaggeration to use the word "depletion." My colleagues believe that the current crisis of the monetary system is due to: first, the falling prices reflected by the high value of the currency; second, the capital flight caused by public anxiety; and third, the departure from parity (Lisparit) caused by the adverse balance of international payments. Chip depletion is not a factor. The initial editions of the rescue should focus on balancing international payments and stabilizing the currency value. Recently, the financial authorities have made statements indicating that the strategies for stabilizing the currency value are already under careful study. We do not want to add speculation and confuse public opinion. However, from the perspective of the general situation, there is something that can be told to the people of the country: the unlimited avoidance of disasters, judging from the meaning of human evolution, there is absolutely no one who would be happy to let it evolve. Since currency is the measure of value, it must maintain a position superior to general value. This is an indelible truth. Therefore, the theory of "anything can be currency" is unworkable, and the idea of "power is currency" is also illusory. Varying opinions only increase public anxiety, and the situation will become more serious. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Open Doubles: Ska Wins Championship Yesterday</h3>
<p>Defu and Qiu Feihai Subdued, Fobbs Wins Over Xu Demin, Senior Singles Final Today</p>
<p>The Shanghai Athletic Lawn Tennis Association held the final of the junior singles and open doubles championships yesterday. As a result, Fobbs won the junior singles over Xu Demin, and Karlsson and Ska won the open doubles over Defu and Qiu Feihai, winning the championship. Today afternoon, Karlsson and Wang Wenzheng will compete for the senior singles championship, starting at 2:15 PM at the French Business Association.</p>
<p>Junior Singles Final</p>
<p>Fobbs Wins Two Sets in a Row</p>
<p>Xu Demin has repeatedly defeated famous players in junior singles and has become the only popular figure. Yesterday, he competed with Fobbs for the championship, with a great deal of confidence. However, after entering the field, he was overly cautious and made many self-inflicted errors, losing the first set with a score of four to six. At the beginning of the second set, Fobbs's slice serve and smash were still powerful, and Xu responded well. The score was close at first, but later, eager to win, several long shots went out of bounds, resulting in losing the second set again with a score of four to six.</p>
<p>Xu Demin Makes a Comeback</p>
<p>The third set was a matter of life and death. Fobbs was ambitious, intending to take it down in one go, but Xu Demin was not weak. He was careful, and the ball went back and forth, full of spirit. The wonderful moments made Fobbs unable to fight back, immediately returning the color with a score of six to four. In the fourth set, Xu planned to take advantage of the victory to save the situation, but Fobbs's skills were experienced, and his attitude was calm, winning several games in a row. Xu became discouraged and lost the fourth set with a score of one to six, and Fobbs won the junior championship with a score of three to one. The results are as follows:</p>
<p>Open Doubles Final</p>
<p>A One-to-One Tie is Created</p>
<p>The doubles final between Defu and Qiu Feihai against Ska and Karlsson was well-matched on both sides, and the strength was comparable. Therefore, yesterday's game was full of excitement. After the start, Defu and Qiu were calm and began to attack. Ska had just entered the field and was a little nervous. His heart was flustered, and he lost the first set completely. In the second set, Ska's spirit was slightly calmer, and the connection was better. He carefully faced the opponent. Defu and Lao Qiu were inevitably careless after winning. Ska took advantage of the opportunity to attack, winning five consecutive games. Lao Qiu's recovery was ineffective, resulting in a one-to-one tie.</p>
<p>Dragon and Tiger Fight: Ska Wins</p>
<p>At the beginning of the third set, Lao Qiu revitalized his military appearance, and Defu was also eager to avenge him. Ska was unwilling to show weakness, fighting and defending. By the second game, the intensity of the competition was unprecedented. In the end, Ska responded properly, and Defu and Qiu lost, and their vigor was frustrated. This set was lost again. In the fourth set, Qiu was calm and used his lifelong skills to block the enemy. Karlsson repeatedly applied high pressure, and Lao Qiu returned with dead balls. Back and forth, they were evenly matched, holding each other for as many as nine games. Defu and Lao Qiu gradually felt their strength waning, but Ska was still able to encourage his remaining male companions to fight to the death.

<h3>Shaanxi: All Civil Servants to Receive Remedial Education</h3>
<p>Shao Lizi, Chairman of the Shaanxi Provincial Government, in order to increase administrative efficiency, has specially formulated the Shaanxi Province Civil Servant Remedial Education Measures. All county magistrates and civil servants under the county are required to receive remedial education. However, those who have special circumstances or have received education at or above the level of a specialized school may be granted a deferral or exemption upon approval. Remedial education will be conducted through correspondence and lecture methods. The teachers for correspondence courses will be senior officials designated by the provincial government and various departments, as well as assistant instructors from the Local Government Affairs Research Association. When teaching specialized subjects through correspondence, the provincial government may temporarily hire professors from specialized schools or universities in the province. There are four methods for civil servants in each county to attend lectures: (1) Each department may consider the situation in each county annually, select civil servants from each county responsible for civil affairs, finance, education, and construction in stages, and hold a lecture meeting for one month at the Local Government Affairs Research Association in the province. (2) When the provincial government and various departments send personnel to various counties for inspection or investigation, they should inform the committee members in detail about the main points of the province's administration and central tasks, so that they can lecture to the civil servants in the counties they pass through. (3) The provincial government may, during the annual school winter and summer vacations, solicit teachers from secondary schools or above who have returned to their hometowns on vacation to lecture to civil servants in the counties they pass through. The meals and accommodation will be provided by the county governments. (4) If the county government can invite specialized scholars to lecture to civil servants and submit a lecture record for review, the previous lecture will no longer be held. As for correspondence subjects, there are six: Party Doctrine, Civil Administration, Finance, Education, Construction, and Law. The provincial government and various departments, depending on the administrative needs of each county, may separately purchase and print books and regulations related to the specialized items in charge and distribute them to the county governments for reference in remedial education. Civil servants in each county who are absent from remedial education without reason will be given a reprimand or demerit. The administration is very serious.</p>

<h3>Little Boy (52)</h3>
<p>— Original by Ms. Alcott, Translated by Zheng Xiaocang (Zonghai)</p>
<p>I don't know which little bird spread the news to headquarters, so when Amy and Don were fighting like a pair of little hounds, other people also showed fierce and excited expressions on their faces, shouting and encouraging them to continue their efforts. Suddenly, Mr. Pei walked into the enclosure and forcibly pulled the pair of combatants apart with his powerful hands, and said in a voice they rarely heard:</p>
<p>"I don't allow this, children. Stop it immediately; and don't let me see this again. My school is for receiving children, not for receiving beasts. You should look at yourselves and feel ashamed."</p>
<p>"Let me go, I want to beat him to the ground again," Don shouted, even though someone was holding his collar, he was still struggling to get past.</p>
<p>"Come on, come on, I haven't been beaten down yet!" Amy also shouted, even though he had fallen to the ground five times, he didn't know what defeat was.</p>
<p>"They are imitating the gladiators of Rome, Uncle Fei," Xiaoqiao said loudly, his eyes widening extraordinarily because of that fresh novelty.</p>
<p>"They are just a bunch of good animals; but I think we should be much more advanced than them, and I don't want you to use my barn as a fighting arena. Who started this?" Mr. Pei asked.</p>
<p>Several voices replied: "Don."</p>
<p>"Don't you know this is forbidden?"</p>

<h3>What Will Happen to a Machine That Doesn't Move and a Brain That Isn't Used?</h3>
<p>— Ling</p>
<p>Near my home, there are two small machine shops that weave silk and satin. The sound of the looms can be heard all day long.</p>
<p>One day, my younger siblings and I went to visit the small machine shops. The place was very small, dark, and without fresh air. However, although the place was small, there were several machines, divided into manual machines and electric machines. The workers each occupied a manual machine, moving their hands and feet constantly, weaving very carefully. There were only one or two people watching next to the electric machines, but the output of the machines in a day was several times more than that of manual weaving.</p>
<p>Later, I found a machine standing there in a dark and damp corner, covered with a thick layer of dust. Where there was no dust, it was yellow. I asked them, "Why don't you use this machine?" They said, "Because it hasn't been used for a long time, it has rusted and can't be used now." After hearing this, I suddenly thought, "A machine that doesn't move rusts, what will happen to a brain that isn't used?"</p>
<p>The human brain is like a machine that moves and stops. The more the brain is used, the more advanced and sensitive the thinking becomes, which can promote the success of a career. However, after thinking, you must rest, otherwise, if you use it too much, the brain will develop diseases. This is the metaphor of a machine working. Some people think that using their brain is a troublesome thing. Whenever something happens, they have no idea. As a result, their brain eventually becomes dull and degenerates. This is like a machine rusting. Children! If you want your thinking to be sharp and progressive, then you must use your brain to do things often. In the near future, your thinking will naturally become more advanced and sensitive.</p>
<h3>Are We Not as Good as Black People?</h3>
<p>— Kang Jian Zhai Fu</p>
<p>There is an old saying in China called "A common man is innocent, but he is guilty of possessing a treasure." If you have a treasure at home, but you don't have the power to protect it, others will covet it and come to fight for it. If you have beautiful rivers and mountains, forests and minerals, but you don't know how to develop and utilize them, others will start thinking and scheming. Currently, Italy's actions towards Abyssinia are just like this.</p>
<p>According to the Black-shirt Prime Minister Mussolini, representing the Italian nation, he openly declared to the world: We want to attack Abyssinia not with the intention of disrupting peace; it is really because we don't want our people to starve to death in a barren area, and we want to expand our colonies to extend our lifeline. He said that white countries, such as Portugal, Belgium, and the Netherlands, all have fertile colonies, so why can't Italy have one!</p>
<p>As for Abyssinia, in the eyes of the Italians, it fundamentally does not have the qualifications of an independent country; it should not enjoy the right to international equality at all. Because it is still a foolish and barbaric black country. This view is not only held by the Italians. White people all think the same way. The British are superficially protecting Abyssinia, but in reality, they don't want Italy to swallow this piece of fat meat alone.</p>
<p>The law of the jungle, the survival of the fittest, is always the iron law in the history of ethnic struggle. Whether black people can keep this piece of fat meat in the tiger's mouth depends on the outcome of the fierce fighting between those tigers and wolves. As far as the current national spirit of Abyssinia is concerned, this spirit of unyielding, united hatred against the enemy, and preparing to fight the strong to the death is worth a head-on blow to the big nation that embraces the policy of non-resistance and blindly tolerates.</p>
<p>Children! Are we not as good as black people?</p>

<h3>Goethe Who Loved Children</h3>
<p>Goethe was a world-renowned great poet. When he was young, he was very fond of children. One afternoon, he was leisurely strolling alone in a mountain village. This mountain village had farmhouses, warehouses, and squares, and the scenery was very good. He casually walked to a lush linden tree. He saw that it was very deserted there. Everyone had gone to the fields. Only one child about four years old and one child about half a year old were together. The older one was sitting on the ground, holding his hands on the chest of the younger one standing between his legs. He himself was like a comfortable chair. His black pupils looked around, his eyes were lively, but he sat motionless. This scene made Goethe very happy. He sat on an facing plow and happily sketched the posture of the two children. He added the fence, warehouse door, and several broken cart wheels next to them, all according to the distance, doing it for an hour. He actually completed a well-organized and very interesting painting? ... He sat on the plow for two hours. In the evening, the mother of the two children came. He learned that their family situation was not very wealthy. He gave the children some money and then parted ways with them.</p>
<p>From then on, the children became familiar with him. He often gave them candy or some cream bread to eat. Gradually, the children in that village all became his close friends.</p>
<h3>Soft and Hard Skills</h3>
<p>— Zhen</p>
<p>Because Min saw that he was studying hard, his father gave him a hunting gun for shooting birds. After getting the gun, he wanted to test his eyesight every day, but he was troubled by the lack of birds coming.</p>
<p>One day, he scattered a lot of grain in the courtyard, waiting for an opportunity. Gradually, a greedy bird came. So he aimed at the bird and shot it with a bang.</p>
<p>At that time, he felt unspeakable joy in his heart, but the bird actually flew away. What was going on? It turned out that he had already known it when he was aiming at it. By the time he shot it with a bang, it had already flown to the eaves. At this time, he was both angry and annoyed. And the bullet in his gun hit the bamboo pole on the quilt that was being dried, so he ran over very anxiously, because he was afraid of breaking the quilt and being blamed by his mother. He knew that the bullet was embedded in the quilt. He felt very surprised and quickly took the bullet out and ran to the study.</p>
<p>"Brother, I was shooting a bird just now, but I didn't hit the bird, but I hit the quilt. Why couldn't I break the quilt?"</p>
<p>"Brother, do you know the saying that 'one bowl doesn't make a sound, two bowls clatter'? This can give us a good motto, and we know that no matter what happens, conflict will only occur if both sides have a tough attitude. If one side is hard and the other side is soft, it will never happen. The reason why the bullet can't break the quilt is also the same reason. The bullet is released from the muzzle of the gun, and it has a very strong force. This force comes from the speed. If the speed decreases, its force will also decrease. It hits the quilt because the quilt is loose and has room to give way. When it is hit by the bullet, it immediately retreats backward, and the bullet is subjected to its resistance, which reduces the speed and thus reduces the force, so it cannot break the quilt. If there is only a thin layer of cotton, it will also be broken. For example, a car can move very quickly on a crisp road, but it will be very difficult to move forward if it gets stuck in the mud. The bullet hitting the cotton is very similar to this situation."</p>
<h3>Thumbs and Animals</h3>
<p>— Bing Yu</p>
<p>We usually write, draw, take things, and work, all relying on the activities of the fingers of both hands. If the fingers are injured, then various actions will be very inconvenient. This is a set of the most peculiar equipment given to us by nature. However, animals other than humans also have equipment comparable to our hands. For example, the claws of crabs and shrimps, the feet of birds, and the front feet of reptiles and mammals all have effects comparable to our hands. Among them, the fingers of apes and monkeys are the same as humans, that is, there are five: thumb, index finger, middle finger, ring finger, and little finger. The thumb can be combined with the other four fingers to pinch, take, pick up, and hold. However, human hands are not more sensitive than ape hands, but because of the function of the brain, they use both hands to move freely, and according to the thoughts of the brain, they invent all kinds of civilized weapons, especially the thumb in the fingers, which is most important for all activities. If there is no thumb, then the effect will be reduced. In the mammals, the apes, their thumbs are shorter than the other four fingers, so various actions will naturally reduce the energy. We can understand how the action is by looking at the following figures, which show the presence or absence of thumbs and their length. For example, Figure 1 is the human thumb, the finger joints are the longest, Figure 2 is the orangutan, Figure 3 is the chimpanzee, Figure 4 is the gibbon, Figure 5 is the small ape, Figure 6 is the lemur, Figure 7 is the bear, Figure 8 is the lion, Figure 9 is the pig, Figure 10 is the rhinoceros, Figure 11 is the cow, Figure 12 is the horse. From 1 to 6, there are thumbs, from 7 to 12 there are no thumbs.</p>
<h3>The Acrobatic Pyramid of Articles</h3>
<p>— Du Ye Mu</p>
<p>On the opening day of Children's Year, the China Children's Culture Association hosted poor children at the Shanghai West Commune. I also went to participate that day. When the poor children saw the acrobatic pyramid being performed on the stage, they all clapped and cheered, expressing great satisfaction.</p>
<p>Since the children are so happy to watch the acrobatic pyramid on the stage, then why don't they like to read the acrobatic pyramids in the various "Children's Weekly" in books or newspapers?</p>
<p>The acrobatic pyramids in the various "Children's Weekly" in books or newspapers are the kind that makes us use another kind of eye. This eye is not born under our eyebrows, but is born in our brain. With this kind of eye, we can see the acrobatic pyramids in books or everything else.</p>
<p>The completion of an "article" depends entirely on the "paragraphs", but the completion of the "paragraphs" depends entirely on the "sentences", the completion of the "sentences" depends entirely on the "words", and the completion of the "words" depends entirely on the "characters".</p>
<p>Here I will explain the characters, words, sentences, paragraphs, and articles.</p>
<p>"Character" ... A character is one by one "single character", such as: "儿", "刊", "週", "童".</p>
<p>"Word" ... A word is to express a meaning, such as: "兒童", we will know that it is "children", "週刊", we will know that it is a publication that is published once a week. - In fact, the four "characters" of "兒童週刊" can be said to be a "word". The difference between a character and a word is that a "character" cannot express a meaning, such as "刊", can you think of anything in your brain? Therefore, a "word" can express a meaning, such as "兒童週刊."</p>
<p>"Sentence" ... A sentence is to link words together and be able to express a "complete meaning". For example, the "word" "兒童週刊", although it is a "meaning", it is not complete. "What about the Children's Weekly?" Yes, "We read the Children's Weekly", adding the two words "We", "Read", can become a complete meaning, this is a "sentence".</p>
<p>"Paragraph" ... A paragraph is made up of many sentences that are governed by a "central meaning". "What about me reading the Children's Weekly?" This sentence still cannot express your complete meaning, so it must be explained by many sentences, but these many sentences are completely governed by a "central meaning".</p>
<p>"Article" ... Some articles can be explained in one paragraph, but some articles require many paragraphs. An article is a combination of paragraphs.</p>
<p>Children! In this way, from "character" to "word", from "word" to "sentence", from "sentence" to "paragraph", from "paragraph" to "article", going up level by level, is it not also an acrobatic pyramid? This is called the acrobatic pyramid of articles.</p>
<h3>Six Strange Fish</h3>
<p>— Dong Xun</p>
<p>There are many strange creatures living in the ocean, especially many odd-shaped fish that are not found in rivers, lakes, and marshes. Some of the fish in the sea are very fierce, some are very beautiful, some have very long bodies, and some are very strong, capable of overturning small boats... They are truly diverse, and it is impossible to describe them all.</p>
<p>Now, let me introduce six strange fish from the sea to the children:</p>
<p>(1) This fish is called the mudskipper (also known as the "Lan Hu" fish). The first dorsal fin on its back is taller and softer than the second dorsal fin, resembling a sail on a sailboat. Usually, it lives in shallow seas with a mixture of salt and fresh water, crawling in mud holes at the bottom of the sea. It swims very fast in the water and is also very good at jumping. Its flesh is very delicious and can be eaten.</p>
<p>(2) This is the ocean sunfish. Its body is flat and tall, almost oval in shape, and about five or six feet long. Its mouth is very small; both the dorsal and anal fins are very high, the caudal fin is crescent-shaped, and it has no ventral fins. Its skin is very rough, much like leather. It usually swims in the upper or middle layers of the ocean.</p>
<p>(3) This is the remora. Its body is up to two feet long; its head is flat, and on top of its head is an oval-shaped suction cup with more than twenty horizontal wrinkles. It often uses it to stick to the bottom of ships or the bodies of other fish to make a living.</p>
<p>(4) This fish is called the sailfish. Its body is round and long, and both the dorsal and anal fins are divided into two sections; its upper jaw protrudes very far; it is eight or nine feet long overall; the back of its body is bluish-black, slightly tinged with light black, and the abdomen is silvery-white. Its flesh tastes very good.</p>
<p>(5) This is the squarehead fish. It usually lives in the mud at the bottom of shallow seas. It is more than one foot long; the color of its back is red, and the abdomen is white; its head is very large, and the frontal bone is raised, slightly square, so it is called the squarehead fish.</p>
<p>(6) This is called the sole fish because its body looks very much like the sole of a shoe. Some people also call it the tonguefish, commonly known as the "Zhu Ta" fish. Its body is flat and tongue-shaped, about one foot long; all its fins are connected; both of its eyes grow on the left side of its body, the left side of the body is yellow with black spots and covered with ctenoid scales, and there are three lateral lines. The right side is light white, so some people consider the left side of its body as the back and the right side as the abdomen.</p>
<h3>Word Guessing Game</h3>
<p>— (Jing Xian)</p>
<p>Wang Er and Li Er are good friends. During the summer vacation, they often play together. One day, Wang Er said to Li Er, "I have a word puzzle for you to guess."</p>
<p>Li Er said, "Okay! You say it, and I'll guess."</p>
<p>Wang Er said, "Enough above, not enough below; enough below, not enough above; the top and bottom combined into one. Please guess what it is."</p>
<p>Li Er thought for a long time but couldn't guess what it was.</p>
<p>Wang Er said, "It's the character '卡' (ka)!"</p>
<p>Li Er said, "I also have a word puzzle for you to guess: 'A hornless ox, ridden by three people.' What character is that?"</p>
<p>Wang Er thought for a while and said, "I'm afraid it's the character '奉' (feng)?"</p>
<p>Li Er said with a smile, "After all, you are smart; you guessed it right away."</p>
<h3>The Story of the White Mountain Crow (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Xi</p>
<p>My father, extremely angry for a moment, said loudly: "My family is definitely not like this when singing. For hundreds of years, we have passed down from father to son, with a special singing voice. Every night I sing aloud, and on the first floor there is an old gentleman, and in the top floor a young working girl, who often opened their windows, listening intently. Moreover, I am ashamed to see that your terrible and ridiculous feathers, which look as if they are sprinkled with white powder, are like a clown in an opera troupe. Haven't I suffered enough? If I were not the most peaceful mountain crow, I would have plucked all your feathers, like a chick just out of its nest."</p>
<p>Seeing my father being so unfair, I also shouted angrily: "Good! Good! Sir, that's how it is. I don't need to live with you anymore! I will leave your sight, so your eyes no longer have to see my unfortunate white feathers. Sir, I have decided to leave. I will fly away; fortunately, my mother always has three litters of babies every year, and there will be many children in the future to comfort your old age; from now on, I will leave you far away to hide my sorrow, and maybe," then I sobbed, "maybe I will find some earthworms or spiders in the neighbor's back garden or drainpipe to sustain my sad life."</p>
<p>My father didn't soften after hearing my words, saying, "Suit yourself; let me never see you again! You are not my son; you are not a mountain crow."</p>
<p>"May I ask you, sir, then what am I?" I asked.</p>
<p>My father said angrily: "I don't know, but you are definitely not a mountain crow."</p>
<p>After saying these hurtful words, the old man slowly walked away. My mother flew up sadly and went back to her bowl to cry. As for me, I was dejected and extremely distressed, flying away for my life, just as I had said to my father before, straight to the neighbor's drainpipe.</p>

<p>The gold market's movement wavers; only due to excessive short positions, and stagnant chips, major players on the bull side are spectators.

However, the banks paid one after another, and Xingye Guohuo and Huashang Bank also paid. The process was even tighter. Banks took advantage of the high price to close out and then turned flat. After that, the situation was peaceful. The banks were still selling, and the US dollar once slightly loosened, but Sassoon paid for the British to close out, and the American banks maintained cheaply. It was predicted that Indian silver would contract by two annas. The Huashang psychological remained good, and it tightened again at noon.

<h3>Weekend Bank Clearing is Not Weak</h3>
<p>Yesterday was Saturday again, and the leisure atmosphere in the money market was still undiminished. The bank's clearing situation seemed busier than in the middle of last week. Because there are many current loan inflows and outflows, various exchange situations and business scope have also improved slightly. However, because the money houses are unwilling to lend funds indiscriminately, the operating conditions of other commercial firms and the clearing of silver dollars are ultimately slow and slack. Therefore, there is no possibility of smooth access to the need for silver dollar funds. The price of foreign exchange in the market has always been 13%, and there has been no increase or decrease for several days. The same is true for drawing heads and adding water, which is probably a white draw. The market has reached more than a month without a situation of adding water at the market price. The width of its drawing head lining is self-evident. Judging from the current situation, there may be no obvious market situation in the middle of this month. In short ticket trading, the early market turnover was more than 3.7 million, the new transactions were more than 300,000, the noon market turnover was more than 400,000, and the transaction in the Small General Association was more than 600,000. Foreign exchange pawn loan transactions, this time the number is always small because the house blocked it from doing so. Although there were more than 900,000 redemptions yesterday, only more than 400,000 new ones were made, such as securities and cargo warehouse receipts. The banknotes recovered more than 600,000, and issued more than 200,000 circulating coupons, more than 300,000 secretly marked coupons, the source of passenger routes was 200,000, the amount of existing foreign exchange was 250,000, banknotes 200,000, the money house foreign exchange public bill cleared more than 47 million, the foreign exchange drawing head money cleared 4.78 million, various remittances were more than 700,000, and the received cash was more than 600,000. In bank clearing, foreign banks cleared more than 2.5 million in bill funds, various cargo exchange tax pledges and other funds cleared 4.23 million, special remittances were more than 800,000, foreign exchange settlement was more than 700,000, telegraphic transfers were more than 600,000, and warehousing was 500,000. Huashang Bank cleared more than 2.5 million in bill funds, various cargo exchange tax pledges and other funds cleared 3.78 million, telegraphic transfers were more than 800,000, special remittances were more than 500,000, foreign exchange settlement was more than 800,000, and warehousing was 800,000. Japanese banks cleared more than 2.67 million in bill funds, various cargo exchange and other funds cleared 3.45 million, special remittances were more than 600,000, foreign exchange settlement was more than 600,000, telegraphic transfers were more than 500,000, and warehousing was 600,000. Looking at the current situation, it is chaotic and unspeakable, and there is little new news to record. As for the recent situation of subsidiary coins, the difference is minimal, and transactions are also very few. Jiangnan small foreign coins are particularly dull. Yesterday, it rose slightly by 50 cents. The price in both the morning and afternoon markets was the same at 833 yuan and 50 cents. Transactions were made, 3,000 cents in the morning market, and only 1,000 cents in the afternoon market. Guangdong small foreign coins were 749 yuan and 90 cents in the morning market, and 749 yuan and 50 cents in the afternoon market. There was a difference of only 40 cents between the two markets, and compared with the price in the afternoon market the day before, it fell by one yuan. Transactions were made, 145,000 cents in the morning market, and 80,000 cents in the afternoon market. Copper coins remained the same, still at 344,500 wen, with 33,761 strings traded, for a combined price of 9,800 foreign exchange.</p>
<h3>Securities: Both Long and Short Positions are Swapping Public Bonds</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Huashang Securities Exchange was dull due to being Saturday. Market prices were extremely sluggish. Both long and short positions were calmly swapping under extremely peaceful conditions. The news about Italy and Austria was different in various newspapers, and there were obvious conflicts. At this critical juncture, whether there will be a turnaround, there should be a clearer indication in three to four days. Mr. Rothchild is about to arrive in Shanghai, and whether his actions will be favorable or not is not certain, but people in the market still mostly have wishful thinking. There are only one or two days left for the September futures, and it is expected that there will not be much change. The 96 speculation has also become quiet. The course of yesterday was safely passed in a hovering situation throughout the day. The short positions on the 16th and the long positions on the 48th had more transactions, but they were evenly matched and there was not much difference. For the rest, there was a slight sell-off on the 11th and 47th, and a slight purchase on the 5th and 14th. Supply and demand was also quite supplied. The market price reached 10 yuan and 5 cents for the third time, which was the most recent high price, but it still returned to 4 cents at the closing price. The momentary ups and downs have come to an end. Yesterday's market price results were 19 Kaisan, each down by 5 cents, and 96 also down by 5 cents. For the rest, there was a consistent rebound of 1 or 2 cents, but the current month's compilation and legacy was good for 3 and a half cents, which was uniquely high. The total number of transactions was 9.17 million yuan. The results of its rise and fall are compared and listed on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan).</p>
<p>US Stocks Fell Due to War Rumors</p>
<p>Xinfeng Foreign Company reported that yesterday (20th), the New York stock market fell due to war panic. Within two hours of the opening, the number of transactions reached 1.33 million shares. Afterwards, there was a slight resistance, and the market rebounded slightly under the leadership of military stocks. Copper mining stocks were firm, and railway stocks rebounded due to freight train reports. Chemical stocks had mixed ups and downs. In the afternoon, selling pressure rose again, indicating that the hearts of people on Wall Street were shaking. Small trades and evening trading fell slightly, and public bonds also fell slightly. The total number of transactions for the whole day was 2.22 million shares. The Dow Jones Index is listed on the left.</p>

<h3>Cotton Yarn: The Bull Faction is Determined to Take Delivery This Month</h3>
<p>The yarn market experienced morning gains and afternoon losses, with the situation turning soft again. However, the market sentiment for this month is uniquely strong. Although the bear faction is delivering, the bull faction, considering the recent active sales of spot yarn and the gradual decrease in yarn inventory, is determined to take delivery. The delivery volume at the end of this month will definitely be huge. As for the future trend, it is relatively weak because there is a surplus of Japanese yarn in Qingdao, which is being dumped in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Future Yarn Prices Unanimously Decline</p>
<p>For standard yarn, the pre-market opening price showed a continued increase of six jiao for this month, due to the bull faction pulling in 1,000 bales, making the market tight. The price for distant months rose by three, four, and five jiao, reaching the second board. This month is exceptionally strong. As a result, this month's closing price was 1.10 yuan higher than the previous day's closing price, while distant months rose by two, three, and four jiao. After the afternoon opening, except for this month, the distant months were unanimously weak, and the market atmosphere was particularly sluggish. According to market sources, foreign firms were selling off, and spot yarn sales turned sluggish after an initial period of activity, leading to a bearish outlook for distant months. With the situation in Italy and Abyssinia easing, the market gradually declined. As a result, this month's closing price was 0.10 yuan lower than the morning closing price, while distant months fell by seven, eight, nine jiao to one yuan. The sales included 450 bales from Dafu, 550 bales from Tongji, 900 bales from Gengfeng, 350 bales from Dachangcheng, 550 bales from Tongfeng, 750 bales from Xincheng, 900 bales from Jinchang, 650 bales from Renfeng, 515 bales from Taichang, and 650 bales from Hengchang. The purchases included 700 bales from Dafu, 600 bales from Yukang, 1,200 bales from Renfeng, 700 bales from Changfeng, 700 bales from Runkang, 650 bales from Zhenda, 800 bales from Shenchang, 350 bales from Changyu, 350 bales from Minghua, and 350 bales from Hengde. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day are as follows:</p>
<p>Standard Yarn: Highest Price, Lowest Price, Closing Price, Change, Outstanding Balance</p>
<p>September: 170, 174.0, 174.3, Up 1.00, 12,700</p>
<p>October: 171.6, 170.6, 170.6, Down 0.30, 43,150</p>
<p>November: 170.8, 169.5, 169.5, Down 0.80, 50,900</p>
<p>December: 110.4, 169.2, 169.2, Down 0.70, 58,800</p>
<p>January: 170.0, 168.9, 168.9, Down 0.70, 26,950</p>
<p>February: 170.4, 169.2, 169.2, Down 1.00, 16,800</p>
<p>Total: 219,400</p>
<p>Spot Cash Sales Slightly Decline</p>
<p>Spot yarn sales have slightly declined. A total of 628 bales were sold by various merchants throughout the day. Prices were similar to the previous day. The purchase amounts for each region are as follows:</p>
<p>Inland: 107, Xiamen: 22, Nanjing: 38</p>
<p>Guangdong: 258, Jiangxi: 5, Wuhu: 16</p>
<p>Brokers: 10, Jiujiang: 5, Changsha: 12</p>
<p>Yunnan: 60, Tianjin: 50, Hankou: 15</p>
<p>Haizhou: 30</p>
<p>Spot Cotton Overwhelmed, Standards Weaken</p>
<p>The cotton market is weakening due to the recent surge in supplies from various sources. Although sales continue, wholesale transactions are notably lacking. Some yarn factories have not yet resumed operations, resulting in a perceived surplus of raw materials. However, the trend for foreign cotton remains high, so speculators are absorbing supplies without releasing them.</p>
<p>Zheng Standard Cotton Market Sentiment Softens</p>
<p>The Zheng Standard Cotton market opened with near-month contracts falling by three to five British pounds. Indian cotton rose by 1.5 to 3.75 rupees. After the second board, it was reported that Osaka's Sanpin cotton had fallen by six to seven jiao. Arrivals from various regions were also abundant, and market sentiment remained flat. As a result, the near-month contracts closed down by 0.20 to 0.25 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price, while distant-month contracts fell by 0.10 yuan. The afternoon opening was uneventful, with no significant activity. The situation remained flat. Spot cotton sales were sluggish. The near-month contracts closed up by 2,400 dan. The sales included 1,700 dan from Shenji, 1,300 dan from Renfeng, 1,000 dan from Taichang, 1,400 dan from Xinheng, 2,000 dan from Dafeng, 1,100 dan from Minghua, 2,500 dan from Changfeng, and 1,700 dan from Dachang. The purchases included 1,000 dan from Changyu, 4,500 dan from Runkang, 2,800 dan from Yuanxingchang, 3,400 dan from Changhe, 900 dan from Gengfeng, 1,000 dan from Ruid, and 1,400 dan from Yuanyi. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day are as follows:</p>
<p>October: 32.50, 31.35, 31.40, Down 0.15, 155,500</p>
<p>November: 31.50, 31.40, 31.45, Down 0.20, 149,300</p>
<p>December: 31.50, 31.40, 31.45, Down 0.20, 149,300</p>
<p>January: 32.05, 31.95, 31.95, Down 0.10, 118,900</p>
<p>February: 32.25, 22.20, 22.20, Down 0.10, 66,000</p>
<p>Total: 638,300</p>
<p>Fragmented Factory Demand Remains Good</p>
<p>Spot cotton consumption is slightly active. Scattered transactions for factory needs are still being maintained. The sources included 4,256 bales of Yao cotton and 1,100 bales of Tong cotton.</p>
<p>Tongzhou: 26.75, Rihua Factory purchased 1,500 bales. Standard goods delivered to the factory.</p>
<p>Tianjin American Cotton: 44.40, Shenxin Factory purchased 350 pieces. Spot goods delivered to the factory.</p>
<p>Zhengzhou Cotton: 39.00, Shenxin Factory purchased 100 pieces. Spot goods delivered to the factory.</p>
<h3>American Cotton Heavily Shorted</h3>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton opened higher due to favorable news from Liverpool and uncertain foreign political situations. Foreign firms, industry members, and brokers bought in, and prices for all months surged by ten British pounds. Subsequently, short selling increased, and some Liverpool bulls closed their positions. Unfavorable conditions in the wheat and stock markets caused prices to soften. Later, the bulls in the October contracts closed their positions, which were absorbed by manufacturers, and prices rebounded. However, heavy short selling persisted, and prices remained weak. As a result, spot prices fell by five British pounds, and futures prices fell by three to six British pounds. Spot sales were relatively active, with daily disposals. Textile demand was widespread. Estimated weekly sales are equal to production. Heste's estimate of weekly factory use is 151,000 bales. Liverpool inventory is 120,000 bales. English spot cotton rose by 12 points, and futures prices rose or fell by one to three points. Indian cotton initially weakened due to slight selling by Japanese speculators, but later rose due to large purchases by futures traders. Palgor rose by 1.75 rupees. (Reported by Reuter on the 20th)</p>

<p>According to a report from Bombay, the intra-day forecast for Broach cotton on the 21st is 205 rupees, down three rupees from the previous day's closing price.</p>
<h3>Grains: Standard Flour Prices Rise, Many Liquidate Positions</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market was influenced by the quoted prices of foreign wheat, with Chicago down four to five and a half cents and Canada down 1.6 cents. Market sentiment was originally tied to international trends, but now, with foreign wheat softening, the expectations of speculative bulls seemed to have cooled. As a result, the opening price for near-term contracts immediately fell by one cent, and the distant-term contracts initially fell by only a small amount. However, as many speculative bulls liquidated their positions, the price fell by another two cents. In the afternoon opening, this month's price fell further, reaching a low of 5.25 yuan. Later, due to the factory's lack of selling and the inability to view the Italian-British dispute optimistically, retail bulls became active again, rebounding by about two cents from the initial opening. However, it was still down one to two cents from the previous day's closing price, as shown in the table below:</p>
<p>Closing Price on the 20th; Closing Price on the 21st; Change</p>
<p>September: 2.5500; 2.5400; Down 0.0100</p>
<p>October: 2.5850; 2.5700; Down 0.0150</p>
<p>November: 2.6500; 2.6325; Down 0.0175</p>
<p>December: 2.6225; 2.6425; Up 0.0100</p>
<p>January: 2.6775; 2.6700; Down 0.0075</p>
<p>February: 2.6900; 2.6850; Down 0.0050</p>
<h3>Wheat Futures Fluctuate by Only One or Two Cents</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat futures market was generally flat in both the morning and afternoon openings. Due to foreign wheat quotes falling by four to eleven cents, there was no basis for speculative trading inside or outside the industry. Therefore, bids were generally unexcited. Current market observations show that no attention is being paid to domestic inventory or consumption. Price fluctuations were purely driven by international trends, with daily fluctuations limited to one or two cents, making it extremely quiet.</p>
<p>Closing Price on the 20th; Closing Price on the 21st; Change</p>
<p>September: 3.92; 3.89; Down 0.03</p>
<p>October: 4.02; 4.00; Down 0.02</p>
<p>November: 4.11; 4.11; No Change</p>
<p>December: 4.20; 4.20; No Change</p>
<p>January: 4.25; 4.24; Down 0.01</p>
<p>February: 4.30; 4.28; Down 0.02</p>
<h3>Northern Merchants Actively Purchase Siamese Rice, Prices Rise by 0.2-0.3 Yuan</h3>
<p>Domestic Rice: The overall trend continues to be strong. Only Yong rice weakened immediately upon reaching its peak. Other types of rice generally rose in price, especially coarse rice, which was sought after by local merchants, with prices rising by 0.1-0.2 yuan. The city opened with 910 bags of Yong rice, 258 bags of Nanjing rice, and 146 bags of Xiang Chen oil rice. Except for the Yong rice, which was partially sold to Northern merchants, all of it was purchased by local merchants.</p>
<p>Foreign Rice: Orders are unprofitable, and market sentiment continues to be optimistic. Yesterday, Northern merchants searched for Siamese Yuan rice and machine rice. The price of Yuan rice immediately rose by 0.2-0.3 yuan, with Siamese Grade 1 rice reaching 12.35 yuan and Grade 2 reaching 11.60 yuan, both higher than previous openings. Xiao Jiao remained stable, and Saigon rose by nearly 0.1 yuan. The city opened with 1,654 bags of Saigon rice, 1,500 bags of Xiao Jiao rice, and over 800 bags of Siamese rice. Most of the Siamese rice was purchased by Northern merchants, while the rest was taken in by local merchants.</p>
<h3>River Rice Plunges as Arrivals Flood the Market and Sales Stagnate</h3>
<p>(Shanghai South): Yesterday, supplies from various sources flooded the market, with over fifty ships arriving (carrying over 10,000 shi in total). Additionally, two wholesale warehouses remained unsold. Sellers were therefore eager to liquidate their inventory, and could only lower prices, causing the market to decline. As a result, the prices of various kinds of broken rice fell by several fen to about 0.1 yuan. The Tianjin merchants only purchased four to five hundred bags of thin broken rice in bulk. Due to excessive price increases in the previous period, the price plummeted by as much as 0.3-0.4 yuan. Only the newly arrived early rice varieties were fortunate to have limited supply, and the price of Hexia rice remained stable. The price of Dongxin early rice continued to rise by 0.2 yuan, while other new varieties such as Luyang and other new sharp rice fell by 0.1-0.2 yuan due to oversupply. The price of new Yin Yuan remained firm, while the price of old white Yuan remained flat. The price of fragrant old rice was stable.</p>
<p>(Shanghai North): Yesterday, there were thirty-four or five shipments from various sources down the river. Sales of various goods in the market were generally sluggish. The price of white broken rice fell by a small amount, close to 0.1 yuan. The price of white Yuan rice fell by a small amount, slightly more than 0.1 yuan. The prices of new Tuan sharp, Yang sharp, and West new early rice also fell by around 0.1 yuan. The price of thin rice also fell slightly more than 0.1 yuan. Only the Dongxin early rice had a small amount of arrival and active sales, with the price increasing by 0.2 yuan. There was little demand for new Kejian rice, and the market situation was stable. The prices of other goods were peaceful. Several dozen shi of Jiashan new Du sharp rice arrived, with good quality, and the asking price was 9.45 yuan.</p>
<h3>Oil Market: Soybean Oil Soars by More Than One Yuan</h3>
<p>Recently, the soybean oil market has been driven by rising prices in various producing areas, coupled with a depletion of inventory in Shanghai and active sales in various regions. As a result, market prices have been steadily rising, exceeding one yuan compared to before the festival. The local factory oil is even more strained, as manufacturers have successively suspended operations due to the additional taxes imposed by Guangdong Province. With dwindling inventory, market sentiment is panicked, and prices are rising even faster. Yesterday, 400 pieces of factory oil were offered, with prices ranging from 13.25 yuan to 13.1 yuan. 100 pieces of Dalian oil from steamships were offered at 13.2 yuan, 100 pieces of Zhuang oil were offered at 13.3 yuan, and 100 pieces of Niuzhuang oil from sand boats were offered at 13.35 yuan.</p>
<h3>Cottonseed Oil Sales Active in This District</h3>
<p>Sesame oil sales have entered the off-season due to seasonal factors. Since the beginning of this month, there has been a market with no transactions, because the inventory held by Shanghai firms is not easily sold off, leading to sluggish transportation. Although there have been few arrivals recently, new sesame crops in various districts have gradually appeared, and the price of raw materials is average. Therefore, most people are taking a wait-and-see approach. There is little certainty about future trends. The cottonseed oil market was initially in a flat and weak situation, but recently, it has been affected by the rising soybean oil prices, which has boosted sales in this district and stabilized the market. Yesterday, Longji, Dade, and other factories offered 3,000 dan of refined oil at 11.3 yuan. If foreign sales can continue, there may be a slight rebound in the future.</p>
<h3>Hardware: Rapid Sales of French Steel Sheets</h3>
<p>French steel sheets have recently seen a unique surge in sales due to frantic purchases by canning factories. It is reported that 700 boxes have been sold in the past few days, purchased by canning factories such as Xu Yongji and Ling Shuntai. However, the market supply has been quite scarce after these purchases. The asking price is 26 yuan per box, and there are also many retail transactions. Therefore, the situation in the market is very optimistic.</p>
<h3>Dried and Fresh Goods: First Batch of New Quanzhou Round Mushrooms Arrives in Small Quantity... High Cost</h3>
<p>The first batch of new Quanzhou soaked round mushrooms arrived yesterday via the Huaping steamer, totaling 598 boxes. However, it was found that old goods still accounted for the majority of the batch, as the new harvest was very poor and land prices were high, making it unprofitable. Therefore, the arrival was very limited. This shipment was originally intended as a market test. If a good price cannot be obtained, then future arrivals will definitely be even scarcer. Moreover, the prices of new goods from Xinghua are even higher. It is expected that the market for miscellaneous goods may be slightly active in the future, but this will still depend on how the sales go.</p>

<p>Women's Sphere</p>
<h3>From East, West, South, and North</h3>
<p>— Yafei</p>
<p>In Japan, our eastern neighbor, the vigorous election cleanup movement of the past few months is reportedly planning its final promotion on the 22nd of this month, "Women's Day." On that day, the thirty-five groups of the "Election Cleanup Women's Association" will summon 100,000 women to stage a grand demonstration parade. They have formulated the following slogans for the general housewives and men with voting rights:</p>
<p>1.  Elect people with upright character, not concubines.</p>
<p>2.  Elect people who earnestly care about women and children.</p>
<p>3.  If a husband is arrested for cheating, the wife will be implicated.</p>
<p>4.  Prepare delicious breakfasts to encourage husbands to elect virtuous and capable people.</p>
<p>In the West, women representatives from various countries are participating in a debate on the status of women in Geneva. Ms. Yan (Yan Huiqing's niece), the representative of China, said in her speech:</p>
<p>"I hope that Western men, with a chivalrous attitude, will grant women legitimate rights, instead of forcing women to seize equality from men."</p>
<p>In the extremely critical nation of Abyssinia, women are actively preparing for war just like men. Some are generously joining the army, some are donating food, and some are organizing rescue teams.</p>
<p>In the North, in Soviet Russia, women are pushing forward their new mission. Their military training is intensifying day by day, and the number of people joining the army and air force is increasing daily. Not long ago, Moscow's Pravda newspaper said: "We must never forget that Soviet women have accepted their rights, and have also accepted many of their obligations. They study and work like men, and they also have the same martial spirit as men."</p>
<p>As for the South, let's talk about ourselves. Currently, various places are carrying out crackdowns on women's strange clothing. Look at the Guangzhou dispatch of the Da Wan Bao:</p>
<p>"60-70% of the ladies are wearing strange clothes... The ladies with cars... The cars roll by, fleetingly... When the fancy car stops, there are big, swaggering masters or others beside you, who make you afraid to get out of the car."</p>
<p>The lives of women around the world can be generally seen from the above examples. In all capitalist imperialist countries, women are still locked in a situation where they have not universally obtained the right to vote or legislate. In Soviet Russia, which implements new doctrines, women are on par with men in all aspects. As for women in semi-colonial countries, there are two types: one is rebellious and fighting, like the women of Abyssinia; the other is corrupt and seeking temporary peace, like the women of China. Chinese women, in addition to the above-mentioned extravagant ladies with cars in strange clothes, due to our national conditions of being completely exploited by foreigners, it goes without saying that there are also groups of women who have no clothes to wear. The only element for being "human" again in a colony is the atmosphere of struggle. This atmosphere has entered the highlands of Abyssinia but has not entered our country. Compared to humans in the East, West, South, and North, we seem to be the group that is most willing to remain in the lower reaches.</p>
<h3>Fresh Flowers Withered in a Wayfarer's Inn</h3>
<p>— Qian</p>
<p>—Notes on a certain hotel—</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, I went to a large hotel on Xizang Road at ten o'clock in the evening to visit a friend. My friend's room was on the second floor, directly facing the central flower pavilion. The flower pavilion was flanked by courtyards, and the pavilion was filled with long sofas like lazy benches. On one sofa, two pot-bellied men in white silk short jackets and trousers, with gold watch chains hanging on their chests, were dozing off. Judging by the way they were snoring, it seemed as if they would not wake up for ten years.</p>
<p>At this time, many women dressed as modern young mistresses and young ladies walked slowly in and out of the gate in twos and threes. They were all dressed in long cheongsams that tightly wrapped their bodies and revealed their curves, but each of them carried a purse, mostly made of white fine beads. They walked upstairs as if they were treading on familiar ground, or as if they were looking for someone for the first time, slowly twisting their slender waists and swaying their large buttocks, their feet slowly stopping and going on the carpet, while a pair of eyes, like mice just out of their holes, strained to look around.</p>
<p>Several pairs went up to the third floor. During a moment when I wasn't paying attention, the two pot-bellied men on the long sofa had already become energetic, each hugging a beauty in his arms and whispering sweet nothings. Soon, a black-clad girl who came down from the third floor was also stopped by the two pot-bellied merchants. The black-clad girl sat in the middle of the sofa. As a result, the two pot-bellied merchants not only hugged a beauty on each side, but also used one hand on the other side to attack the black-clad girl. The pot-bellied merchant on the left had his right leg pressed on the black-clad girl's left leg, and the pot-bellied merchant on the right was constantly fiddling with the black-clad girl's face and arm with his left hand. The faces of the two fat pigs were smiling like two united gods. However, the black-clad girl only meekly stared blankly at the ground with a pair of empty eyes, like a lamb being slaughtered. The girls sitting on either side could only silently look to one side.</p>
<p>I was very angry when I saw this situation, but my friend said nonchalantly: "What does this count for? These are all prostitutes running hotels, and their whole lives are miserable!" The following is all the explanation my friend gave me.</p>
<p>"This hotel is almost exclusively for Shanghai businessmen, civil servants, and salary earners to gamble and seek entertainment. The prostitutes who come in pairs are still of the Changsan Yaoyao type, and those who come alone are called Tangbai, who specialize in running hotels. When two prostitutes come, only one of them is actually there on business. The other one accompanies and does supervisory work. Prostitutes summoned by the hotel staff split their remuneration equally with the staff, but the entire remuneration does not exceed 15 yuan per night. The prostitute cannot get all of the 7-8 yuan after splitting it. The amount they get differs according to their nature. Generally speaking, there are two types of prostitutes with big business, one is doing "bao" (package deal), and the other is doing "chai" (installment). Prostitutes who do "bao" are girls who are pledged to pimps or brothels. The pledge fee depends on the girl's appearance and figure, but at most it does not exceed 500 yuan. The pledge period is three or five years. During these three or five years, all of the girl's income belongs to the owner of the brothel, and the owner has to provide the girl with clothes, shoes, socks, etc. If the girl's business is good, the owner will look at her differently, and the clothes, shoes, and socks will often be replaced with new ones, but the girl's own pocket money still has to be given some extra money by generous customers. If a girl's business is bad, not only will the owner not buy her clothes, shoes, and socks, but she will also have to do chores, and all the work of chopping wood, cleaning, and cooking will have to be done. Sometimes, she will be beaten.</p>
<p>Prostitutes who do "chai" are girls who belong to pimps or small brothels who do not have much money themselves and cannot get through the docks (cannot bribe the gangsters), and therefore have to be attached to other people's brothels to do business. These girls have to split the 7-8 yuan they earn with the brothel they belong to in a 4-6 or 5-5 split. The brothel may not be responsible for their clothes, shoes, and socks. The 3-4 yuan obtained from splitting must be entirely given to the owner for the first time, and they don't get a single penny themselves. Therefore, prostitutes are actually tied with iron chains and are used as tools for exploiters to make a living. Generally speaking, being a prostitute means entering a fiery pit, and that is not an exaggeration at all."</p>
<p>At midnight at twelve o'clock, I walked out of the hotel door. The prostitutes who came by electric lamp chartered cars outside the door were like the overflowing water after a dam break, an overwhelming force. "When can this slaughterhouse be eliminated?" I asked!</p>
<p>Mid-Length Creation</p>
<h3>Homecoming (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Su Hong</p>
<p>(7)</p>
<p>The sister-in-law opened the cupboard door wide and said anxiously,</p>
<p>"Look! Where is there any salt!"</p>
<p>The salt inspectors looked here and poked there, and what they found were moldy preserved vegetables, dust, and newly born pink baby mice.</p>
<p>"Then we'll go search another house." After the inspectors left, the whole house was a mess.</p>
<p>The sister-in-law tidied up for a long time, planning to cook dinner, but there wasn't a grain of salt for the dishes. She stared at the stone steps for a long time and decided to feed the children breast milk and then go borrow some. Unexpectedly, she had just reached Uncle Lifu's doorway when Uncle Lifu was beating his wife. He held a tree root and roared hatefully, "I'll beat you to death, you bitch, beat you to death..." He was extremely distressed. He had rented five mu of land, put in a lot of effort to cultivate it, and even used a lot of fertilizer. The rice was just starting to grow strong when it was scorched by the sun. Only the one mu and two fen of land at the back of the field had some water to absorb. Although it wasn't scorched by the sun, it was eaten bare by locusts. He often thought to himself, "Who would believe that I'm a farmer who has to buy rice to eat." He had borrowed a lot of usurious loans. Since there was no rice to sell, and he had to pay taxes, the end of the year was approaching, and the accounts couldn't be cleared. Government salt was too expensive, only three jin per load, and only a little bit in the bottom of the basket. He secretly bought a yuan's worth of private salt, and planned to eat this ten jin of salt until next summer, but it was confiscated by the salt inspectors. Not only was the salt confiscated, but they also took two yuan in fines. "Beat you to death, you bitch!" He beat her harder and harder, the blue veins on his calves knotted up. His wife also loved to look good, and she often secretly saved money to spend on foreign goods. She didn't like the sturdy and durable homespun cloth, preferring to buy those colorful foreign fabrics that would tear after being washed a few times. She would also buy new-style fake gold rings and earrings made of fake pearls. Uncle Lifu hated it even more, everything was stuck in his heart. "Burn it, burn it all in a fire, just burn it all." He cursed, throwing the tree root on the ground in frustration, and sat down in the corner of the house, as if crying.</p>
<p>The sister-in-law knew it wasn't the right time to borrow salt, so she raised her voice to comfort her:</p>
<p>"Really, they are too... If I don't buy from them, they say, 'If you don't buy government salt, you must have bought enough private salt.'... Aunt Lifu, don't cry, Uncle Lifu will always figure something out, like us, their father..."</p>
<p>After dinner, the children were all asleep. The sister-in-law mended clothes under the oil lamp while thinking carefully, "If her husband doesn't come back, after the new year, she will hurry to Shanghai to find him; take the younger children with her, and leave the older two for grandma to take care of." She also thought that if she couldn't find her husband, then she would send the younger children to the orphanage, to be servants or seamstresses in people's homes. She was very dissatisfied with Xiu Zhen, always staying at home. She often wanted to talk to her mother-in-law and tell her to marry her off to a man, so there would be one less person to feed at home, and they could get dozens of yuan in betrothal money. She put down her needle, looked at each of the children one by one, covered them with the quilt, and carried the lamp to her mother's room.</p>
<p>Her mother was chanting Buddhist scriptures, and Xiu Zhen was already asleep. The sister-in-law told her about the planned life strategy.</p>
<p>"That's good, I'll always take care of the children, and your sister will also help," her mother said.</p>
<p>"Speaking of my sister, yesterday Aunt Meilin casually told me (she couldn't help but make up a lie) that she wanted to be a matchmaker for my sister... I'm reluctant to part with my sister, she can help a lot here." Although the sister-in-law said this, she was planning in her heart: The older children are older, the matter of picking firewood can be entrusted to the eldest son. "If I go out to work, I want to rent my room to someone, and I can collect two or three yuan a year." She added another plan.</p>
<p>Her mother was just about to say that her daughter-in-law's idea was very good when she heard the sound of a window opening from the wall in Lifu's house, as well as a lot of talking. She changed her tone and said, "What's going on?"</p>
<p>The sister-in-law walked to the window, pushed it open, and saw that the young mistress Wang had also poked her head out, and several of the great-grandfather's daughters-in-law had also poked their heads out.</p>
<p>"Oh dear! Fire!" The sister-in-law looked at the back of the house in front of her, where she saw a red glow.</p>
<p>A strong gust of northwest wind blew in, and the window door closed automatically, hitting the sister-in-law's face. She pushed it open again, held it, and asked repeatedly, "Is there a fire, Aunt Lifu?"</p>
<p>"It's robbers, Lifu just took a foreign gun to the village defense corps."</p>
<p>Young Mistress Wang quickly closed the window and said, "Aju! Quickly press the big door shut, with stones, stones..."</p>
<p>Her mother was shaking all over: "Amitabha—quickly close the window! Rou Ni, get up, put on your clothes." She hurriedly put the spinning wheel behind the bed and hid the teapot on the bedside.</p>
<p>"There's no need to be so anxious. We're so poor, everyone knows that. They must be robbing young master Zhonggui's house." Although the sister-in-law said this, she quickly ran back to her own room. To see the three children.</p>
<p>"Amitabha, protect them from being robbed..." Her mother thought of her patrons of Buddhist scripture chanting.</p>
<h3>Legal Advisor</h3>
<p>(Q) When A was twelve years old, his paternal uncle and aunt died one after another without leaving any descendants. Therefore, A inherited their property. A is now forty-three years old and has no children. A's own mother and siblings are still alive. I would like to ask if A's private property and the inheritance he received from his uncle will be inherited solely by A's wife after his death, or will his mother and siblings also be entitled to a share? (Wang Gu)</p>
<p>(A) According to the information in this case, when the inheritance begins in the future, A's wife should inherit all of the estate. (Lawyer Pu Shunqing)</p>
<p>(Q) I am twenty-one years old this year and got married this spring according to my parents' wishes and through a matchmaker's introduction. (I did not agree to the engagement.) Now I realize that my views are different from my spouse, and it will be difficult to live together for the rest of our lives. I would like to know if I can get a divorce.</p>
<p>If the other party does not agree to the divorce, what legal remedies are available?</p>
<p>If I file for divorce, will I have to compensate them for their losses, or will they have to pay me alimony? (Yin Lian)</p>
<p>(A) Disagreement is not a sufficient reason to sue for divorce, except for divorce by mutual consent. In divorce by mutual consent, the existence of alimony and compensation shall be determined by agreement. To sue for divorce, one must meet one of the conditions listed in Article 1052 of the Civil Code. A party who has suffered damage as a result of a divorce judgment may claim compensation from the other party. If a faultless party is in financial difficulty as a result of a divorce judgment, the other party shall provide appropriate alimony even if he/she is not at fault. (Lawyer Pu Shunqing)</p>
<p>(Q) Before I was born, my father forcibly betrothed me to my uncle's son. After I was born, I was still raised in my family's home. When I was seventeen years old, I formally married. Because I was dissatisfied with this kind of arrangement, and because my husband had contracted venereal disease and infected me after marriage, I left my husband's home to study after I was cured. I have been away for eight years and have never been in contact with him. Furthermore, I have never taken a penny from him for my expenses. Moreover, when I was in his house, he had already taken a concubine. He usually did not engage in proper work and had an opium addiction. Now I have decided to divorce him. I would like to know if there is sufficient legal basis for this? (Yi Wei)</p>
<p>(A) If the situation in this case is not one in which the other party maliciously abandoned you in a continuous state, there is no sufficient legal basis to sue for divorce. Taking a concubine is indeed a reason for divorce, but it has already been extinguished by the statute of limitations. If both parties agree to a divorce, there is no objection. (Lawyer Pu Shunqing)</p>
<p>Lecture on Women's Issues</p>
<h3>Section 2: Political Participation</h3>
<p>— Jun Hui</p>
<p>The so-called political participation issue is the issue of women obtaining equal rights with men in politics. We know that in feudal societies, although there have been empresses who held great power, and other aristocratic women with political genius, this was exceptional. As for the vast majority of women, they were absolutely unrelated to politics, just like serfs who had no right to ask about politics! However, since the modern bourgeoisie used the weapons of democracy! to smash the autocratic kingdoms, they raised this issue. In other words, the issue of women's political participation is a product of bourgeois democracy.</p>
<p>The causes of this issue have been discussed in the previous section. Here, we will only briefly describe the historical development process. Historically, the earliest political participation movement occurred in France. During the French Revolution in 1789, the heroines and Madame Roland issued a declaration of women's rights, advocating equality between men and women in politics. This was the starting point of the women's political participation movement. However, during the reign of Napoleon I, the so-called Napoleonic Code was enacted. This code not only denied the women's political participation movement, but instead placed women in the position of slaves to men. It was not until the July Revolution of 1836 and the February Revolution of 1848 that the issue of women's political participation was raised again. Saint-Simon, Fourier, and other utopian socialists vigorously advocated equality between men and women. Since the failure of Napoleon III in 1871 and the restoration of the republican government, political participation groups have sprung up like mushrooms after rain, but to this day they have only obtained the right to elect members of local self-government bodies. Therefore, although the women's political participation movement originated in France, French women have not yet obtained formal political participation rights.</p>
<p>Secondly, the British women's political participation movement began after 1819. It was influenced by Ms. Wollstonecraft's "A Vindication of the Rights of Woman". The two major social movements of the Reform Act of 1832 before the election, the Corn Laws of 1840, and the opposition to slavery promoted women's awareness. They deeply felt the interest of politics. Since then, not only have women organized various political groups, but the Liberal Party and the Conservative Party have also organized women's political participation groups. For example, the Women's Suffrage Association, the National Union, and the Women's Social and Political Union are among the most powerful women's groups. The former is a moderate faction, which wants to achieve success through constitutionalism, while the latter is a radical faction, whose movement often goes beyond the norm, so it is also called the assertive political participation movement faction. However, their movement did not achieve any results before the war. After the war, because women made many contributions to work and economy during the war, the general attitude of men towards women was different from before. Therefore, the Women's Suffrage Bill was finally passed in the House of Commons on October 2, 1918, by 274 votes to 25.</p>
<p>The American women's political participation movement occurred very early. During the American War of Independence in 1783, women also made contributions to the country like men. Therefore, in 1787, at the Constitutional Convention, women demanded civil suffrage. This was the beginning of the American women's political participation movement. After that, the decade from 1830 to 1840 was the era of the slave liberation movement. At this time, women were greatly stimulated and organized women's political participation movement groups. However, their activities only succeeded after the war.</p>
<p>In addition to the above three countries, other countries have also gradually recognized women's suffrage. However, due to space limitations here, it is not possible to describe them in detail. I will only list the chronology of each country's recognition of women's suffrage as follows:</p>
<p>As shown in the table above, most countries recognized women's suffrage after the Great War. However, no country has given women's suffrage as thoroughly and extensively as the women of the Soviet Union! This is by no means accidental! Because in capitalist society, suffrage is nominally democratic, but in practice, there are various economic and social restrictions. People without money have no room to move on the political stage at all. Especially, after world politics entered the fascist stage, the so-called mask of democracy was completely exposed. The suffrage obtained through a century of struggle was taken away by a few heroic dictators! Now, the issue of political participation is over.</p>

<h3>What Kind of Phonetic Writing Do We Need</h3>
<p>— Shou Zhenqiu</p>
<p>The future trend of Chinese characters will inevitably be phoneticization, which is beyond doubt. So the question now is what kind of phonetic writing do we need, in other words, what conditions should the phonetic writing we currently need meet. In my opinion, this phonetic writing that will be adopted must meet at least the following three conditions:—</p>
<p>First, Simple and Practical. This kind of writing must first be simple and practical, so that it can be accepted by the illiterate masses. The rules of calligraphy should be simple. Eliminate all unnecessary difficulties and cumbersome details, such as the four tones of Chinese characters. But in addition to this simplicity, it must also be practical, sufficient to express all thoughts and feelings. So the so-called simplicity means eliminating all meaningless complexities, making it convenient for everyone to learn, and it is not simply rudimentary. This kind of writing should strive for precision within the scope of easy learning, so that it can be suitable for applications in all aspects.</p>
<p>Second, Internationalization. This kind of writing should thoroughly eliminate the legacy of pictographic characters, adapt to the inevitable trend of internationalization of language, and consciously promote the internationalization of Chinese language. Terms that have already been internationalized, as well as necessary internationalized styles of writing, should be systematically imported. Therefore, its alphabet must use the Latin alphabet, because the Latin alphabet is the most international alphabet.</p>
<p>Third, Colloquialization. This phonetic writing is definitely not a translation of Chinese characters—whether classical or vernacular—but rather a written form of the words spoken by living people. It should make writing and language consistent, on the one hand making writing easy to learn and understand, and on the other hand making it more lively and rich. This kind of writing should break down the walls between writing and language, so that what is read out can be understood, and what can be said can be written. In order to be compatible with colloquial language, it is natural to implement the connected writing of words.</p>
<p>The earliest attempt at phoneticization of Chinese characters was as early as the end of the 19th century. After the Opium War, foreign missionaries who came to China first created local vernacular Romanization. This church Romanization movement was not only because their motive was to anesthetize the people, and therefore became a movement without a future, but also because their vernacular Romanization was only a tool created for the convenience of evangelism, and initially there was no attempt to replace Chinese characters with it. In 1892, Lu Gan Zhang, in 1895, Wu Zhihui, in 1900, Wang Zhao, and in 1911, Lao Naixuan, also created various phonetic alphabets—Qieyin New Characters, Bean Sprout Alphabets, Mandarin Alphabets, Simplified Characters. Some of these alphabets were taken from the radicals of Chinese characters, some were even influenced by Japanese "Kana", and some were derived from seal characters, but they had a common shortcoming, that is, they were not internationalized, and it was even more difficult to connect words.</p>
<p>In the second year of the Republic of China, a conference on unifying pronunciation was held in Beijing, which caused a dispute between various alphabets. As a result, a set of alphabets that the Ministry of Education had decided to temporarily apply in advance was used to pass the alphabet. This set of alphabets is the "Phonetic Alphabet", now renamed "Phonetic Symbols". The phonetic alphabet is still the side of Chinese characters, and it is not written quickly (China seems to have only Mr. Li Jinxi who can write the cursive script of the phonetic alphabet), and it is not convenient for connected writing of words. It was originally formulated to unify the pronunciation of Chinese characters. Later, it was found that it did not deserve the name "alphabet" and was renamed "symbol", which is what it meant.</p>
<p>In the twelfth year of the Republic of China, the National Language Unification Association elected a "National Language Romanization Committee" to engage in the formulation of National Language Romanization. This committee did not start working until the fourteenth year, and six or seven members worked for a year, and it was not completed until the fifteenth year. In the seventeenth year of the Republic of China, when Cai Yuanpei presided over the University Council, it was formally announced by the University Council. This kind of National Language Romanization is different from the traditional alphabets. It uses the Latin alphabet, so it is internationalized in form, which is where it surpasses various alphabets in the past. However, its writing style has become unusually complicated and difficult to learn due to the retention of the four tones. Therefore, in the six or seven years since its promulgation, no one has used it. According to them, it will take a thousand years, five hundred years, or a hundred years to succeed.</p>
<p>The recently emerged Chinese language writing Latinization shares the common ground with National Language Romanization in that it abolishes Chinese characters and adopts the internationalized Latin alphabet. However, Latinization does not use four tones, and the accent is not based on the local dialect of Beijing, so it is very easy to learn. In terms of connected writing of words, Latinization has a more reasonable and systematically neat writing rule. In addition, the "taking spoken language as the standard" advocated by Latinization is its characteristic, and it also cleverly solves the problem of four tones, which is something that National Language Romanization cannot do.</p>
<p>In summary, currently only Latinization can just meet the three conditions of phonetic writing.</p>

<h3>Review of "The Peach Blossom Fan"</h3>
<p>— Ji Xun</p>
<p>It's not that I'm doing free advertising for others, but "The Peach Blossom Fan" is indeed a very good film.</p>
<p>The consciousness is very progressive. Overall, it is anti-feudal, anti-all oppression, and leads people on the road of revolution. The whole play is naturally set in the background of the Northern Expedition period, but if we open our eyes wide, we may see that such an era has not passed: the remaining feudal forces are still exercising brutality, and the tragedy of people oppressing people is still being replayed everywhere, and historical facts are needed to give the oppressed a new reminder and instruction, and "The Peach Blossom Fan" is aimed at this point.</p>
<p>In terms of individuals, Fang Yumin, one of the central figures in the whole play, has an attitude that revolutionaries should have: he does not yield to evil forces, is not tempted by money, and still strives forward. The heroine, Xie Sufang, is inevitably restrained by the bamboo chip merchants due to the bad situation she is in, admires the light, and resists the evil forces. In this decadent era, it is precisely the need for such brave and awakened characters to stimulate the backward and confused men and women!</p>
<p>However, what I am most satisfied with is the structure and skills of the whole play. It does not have lengthy and incoherent scenes, nor forced insertions of facts, and the development of the plot is very natural.</p>
<p>The playwright takes ordinary facts, places several ordinary characters to perform, making people look at the screen as if recalling the past, and seeing the activities of the characters as their own and their friends' experiences. This kind of realistic and ordinary typical depiction can move people more than special fiction. For example, the Qius harassing the backstage and wanting to see the actresses is a common occurrence whether in the past, present, or in North China and the South, but this kind of "common occurrence" is enough to expose the tyranny and brutality of the warlord army.</p>
<p>There are no heroes in the play. Fang Yumin, as the protagonist, is only a member of the intellectual class. He needs entertainment and love, just like ordinary people. Xie Sufang is dissatisfied with her own environment and wants to resist. It is also common for people to admire and pursue ambitious young people like Fang Yumin. If we are more truthful to prostitutes in the alley, she will tell you all her pain and express her goodwill towards you. For example, Sun Daocheng is regarded as the villain in the play, but he does not seem to be very annoying. His badness is also caused by the environment. The playwright's understatement is very reasonable. In short, the playwright's handling of the characters' identities is very appropriate, which is much better than other films!</p>
<p>Regarding the acting skills of the actors, I most approve of Jin Yan and Hu Ping. Their every move is very natural and skilled. Even some small jokes are performed very interestingly and vividly, and do not make people feel bored. In particular, Hu Ping is very skilled in portraying the identity of a female opera singer. She does not have a shy attitude; she does not have the habits of a young lady, but she is lively, generous, and not vulgar. Every frown and smile is lovely. Secondly, Gu Menghu and Wang Cilong are also very competent. Zhang Zhizhi's imitation of the Shandong ×zhou accent is very similar, coupled with his fat body and rough movements, he is even more like Zhang ××, the warlord of the Beiyang period.</p>
<p>The actors' lines have been exempted from the attitude of speeches, which has increased a lot of power to the authenticity of the plot, especially Hu Ping. Her Mandarin is very pure, and she is also a woman's vocal cord, which makes her pronunciation particularly clear. Anyone who speaks Mandarin can fully understand it.</p>
<p>However, there are also small shortcomings in the whole play. For example, when Fang Yumin and Xie Sufang are exposed to the secret in the bridal chamber on the night of their wedding by Wu Xianfa, they do not have to be immediately angry in public and question Sun Daocheng. They can call him into another room and question him slowly, so that they will not appear too flustered. When leaving Xie's house, the situation is not very tense, and none of the relatives and friends came to persuade them, which is a bit insufficient. Also, when Fang Yumin organized a commando team, the number of people was too small, and the emotions and strength of the masses were not shown. These cannot but be said to be oversights on the part of the director.</p>
<p>However, "The Peach Blossom Fan" is still an outstanding film. Naturally, this film cannot be regarded as a top-notch tragedy. Almost every scene has a bit of fun, but drama always contains the meaning of entertainment. As long as it can inspire your emotions and make your life better, it has its artistic value.</p>
<p>Current Affairs Research</p>
<h3>France in the Anglo-Italian Struggle</h3>
<p>— Fang Yuanlin</p>
<p>The development of the Italo-Ethiopian conflict quickly turned into a direct struggle between Britain and Italy. Initially, Britain acted as a mediator, wielding the League of Nations, advocating for the issue to be resolved in Geneva. Italy, on the other hand, adopted a tough stance, fundamentally opposing any third-party intervention in the East African affair, believing that the Italo-Ethiopian issue was a matter between the two countries and should be resolved directly. Subsequently, Britain's attitude also hardened, while France came out to mediate, forcing Mussolini to abandon his rejection of third-party intervention. As a result, representatives were specially dispatched to the Three-Power Conference in Paris, the League of Nations General Assembly in Geneva, and Rome to discuss the East African issue. However, on the other hand, Italian troops continued to head towards East Africa, and their navy conducted large-scale maneuvers in the Mediterranean. More recently, a large army was concentrated in Italian Libya to threaten Egypt. In response, Britain countered by conducting large-scale naval exercises in the Mediterranean and blockading the Strait of Gibraltar or the Suez Canal to threaten Italy. In this way, from East Africa through the Mediterranean to the European continent, the atmosphere was filled with the threat of war. The direct conflict was, of course, between Italy and Britain.</p>
<p>Amidst the increasingly acute Anglo-Italian conflict, France's attitude is most noteworthy. If France and Britain unite, using the League of Nations to restrain Italy, Rome will inevitably be isolated, and Mussolini would not dare to take risks alone in East Africa and the Mediterranean. Conversely, if France assists Italy to resist Britain, then Britain will not easily be able to sanction Italy alone, and the European situation will inevitably undergo even greater changes. Therefore, we can say that in the Anglo-Italian conflict, France holds a pivotal position of great importance.</p>
<p>Since the last World War, Britain, in order to curb France's hegemony in Europe, has consistently pursued a policy of supporting Germany and suppressing France. Under these circumstances, France naturally had to seek other allies to counter, and thus the Franco-Russian Pact and the Franco-Italian Agreement were successively established, allowing France to use the Soviet Union and Italy to restrain Germany and resist Britain. After the outbreak of the East African issue, French politicians did not express a concrete attitude, tacitly allowing Italy to act freely in East Africa, which is a true manifestation of France's attempt to assist Italy in resisting Britain. Observing that Italy concentrated its large army on the Italo-Austrian border during its military preparations, while having no defenses in the area connecting Italy and France, it is even more evident that Mussolini's actions have received considerable understanding from France in secret. But why doesn't France openly help Italy, but instead sings "peace" as a mediator? This is because France has two major concerns. One is the fear that after the outbreak of the East African war, Germany will take the opportunity to seize Austria and advance into the Baltic Sea to attack France and Russia. Since the outbreak of the Italo-Ethiopian conflict, Hitler has not said a word until now, only striving to expand his military preparations, which makes France even more uneasy, and it dares not sit idly by and watch the natural development of events. The other is that France's internal political crisis has reached its peak. If war breaks out and internal problems arise, then the fate of the French Republic will be very difficult to predict. Therefore, although France wants to help Italy resist Britain, on the surface, it has to both befriend Italy and send secret overtures to Britain, adopting a policy of dual reconciliation.</p>
<p>What France has always sought is a collective security system to prevent the outward expansion of German power. In the past, due to Germany's opposition and Britain's lukewarm attitude, the so-called collective security system failed to materialize, which is what France has been extremely dissatisfied with. Now that the Anglo-Italian conflict is becoming increasingly serious, and France occupies a very important position in the middle, the cunning and sly Great Britain, in order to win over France, attempts to exchange its participation in a joint anti-Italian front by supporting the collective security system. As a result, British Foreign Secretary Hoare declared in Geneva that he respected the League of Nations Covenant, and also stated that Britain "supports the collective system to guarantee peace." Sure enough, when France heard the proposal of "collective security system," it felt very happy. Laval immediately declared: "Foreign Secretary Hoare's remarks are a step for Britain to join the collective security system without reservation, so French people are more satisfied with this kind of remark than any other country, because the spirit of England and France taking responsibility for the League of Nations step by step is a symbol of the emergence of a new era in history." However, France is not simple either, and Laval does not completely support the British and abandon Italy just because of Hoare's words. Looking at the entire content of his speech at the League of Nations, one can know what France's attitude is. Very obviously, although he superficially expressed that France supports the League of Nations and called Hoare's support for the "collective security system" a "symbol of the emergence of a new era in history," he also did not forget to tighten relations with Italy and continue to befriend Rome. After praising Hoare's remarks, he went on to say: "The Franco-Italian Agreement established on January 7 this year is not only an agreement to maintain the interests of France and Italy, but also has great importance for world peace. Since the completion of this agreement, France has exhausted everything to seek the increase of friendship with Italy." "Even in terms of the current Italo-Ethiopian dispute, France has adopted a compromising attitude everywhere. Although the solution to this problem is extremely difficult, it is not hopeless to seek a solution that is sufficient to satisfy Italy's desires and maintain the sovereignty of another member of the League of Nations." From this, it can be seen that France's attitude in Geneva is still a manifestation of being all things to all people, trying to befriend all parties. It only particularly reveals that France, because of the hope of "realizing the collective security system," has expressed that Paris and London are closer than before.</p>
<p>However, even Laval's expression has had a great impact. The subsequent declarations of support for the League of Nations by the Soviet Union, the Little Entente, and Portugal can all increase Geneva's momentum. At the same time, Rome expressed disappointment after hearing Daladier's speech. General newspapers criticized Laval's remarks a lot, even calling them "mad dogs." Only Mussolini, because of diplomatic relations, although also a little dissatisfied with Laval's remarks, had to grit his teeth and say: "The cabinet still welcomes with goodwill Laval's speech involving the Rome-Franco Agreement and Franco-Italian friendship. Italy is determined to strengthen friendly relations with France, which is not only beneficial to France and Italy, but also beneficial to European cooperation. The solidity of Franco-Italian friendship will not be broken by colonial disputes." In this way, he tried to hold on to France. Now, the report of the Special Committee has been drafted, and Italy has expressed that it cannot accept it. As for how to respond, both Italy and Ethiopia are studying it. At the same time, Britain and France are secretly negotiating. What Britain is attempting to do is of course to get France to support its actual intervention in Italy, while France hopes that Britain will work with it to realize the "collective security system," demanding that London clearly express its intention to prevent Germany from invading Austria and guarantee peace in Central Europe. But in reality, it is very problematic for Britain to completely sever ties with Germany and Poland and help France and Russia complete the "collective security system" and be responsible for guaranteeing peace in Central Europe. Similarly, it is also what France is unwilling to do to completely stand on the British side to deal with Italy. In addition, Germany and Poland desperately oppose the "collective security system," and Italy recognizes sanctions as a declaration of war, which makes the problem even more difficult to solve. Naturally, judging from the current situation, if Britain and France reach a temporary "understanding," exchanging the "collective security system" for "unanimity against Italy," then it may not be impossible to temporarily eliminate the war. However, judging from Italy's actual situation and the policies it is pursuing, the possibility of war is still very high. Italy has spent 2 billion lire (approximately £33.5 million) in the East African affair. Mussolini has long expressed that his actions in East Africa are not child's play, and the situation has reached the point where war is inevitable. If unfortunately Italy and Ethiopia start a fire, affecting Europe, then France will have to abandon its wandering and hesitant attitude and choose who is its ally or enemy between Italy and Britain. At the same time, the decision-maker of France's fate may not be Laval and Herriot.</p>
<p>Freedom for Working Women</p>
<h3>Female Guide</h3>
<p>— Ms. Xu Yanyi Speaks</p>
<p>My first job was in a department store in Nanjing, needless to say as a female clerk. But this was a startling female occupation in Nanjing at the time. I remember when I was studying at the Nanjing Commercial School, apart from seeing a few female staff members working in government agencies on the street, I didn’t see many women</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>active in other situations. This situation continued unchanged until I graduated from school two years later. But soon, people's fears seemed to gradually subside, and many larger stores also began to hire female staff.</p>
<p>The treatment we received in the store seemed to be a little better than that of the male staff: a monthly salary of twenty-four yuan, food provided, and a salary increase every six months, ranging from three to five yuan, depending on the merit of the performance. As for working hours, it was about the same as in general stores, from 8:00 a.m. to 8:30 p.m. every day, a full twelve and a half hours of work.</p>
<p>On my first day in the store, many male colleagues watched my actions with questioning eyes, as if they wanted to find in me a flaw that would make me unfit to be a female clerk. However, they seemed to have failed in this idea. After I was able to work like them for a few days, everyone changed their attitude towards me and became friendly. Sometimes when I needed to take something from a very high shelf, they would all compete to help me and rush up to get it. I found this situation very funny, but I did not accept their kindness and still wanted to go up and get it myself. Then, they would look at me blankly with disappointed eyes, as if they had lost something.</p>
<p>After working there for half a year, due to my strong personality, the attitude of the general male colleagues towards me gradually changed from questioning and cordiality to hostility. The reason is very simple, because I did not become what they considered to be a "vase." But they are ultimately smart, because I was unwilling to be a "vase," but they would instead say that I was a "vase" hired by the store for public appreciation.</p>
<p>"Son of a bitch, vase!" This kind of vulgar curse in the Nanjing dialect would often intentionally creep into my ears. You want to negotiate with them? But they didn't specify who they were cursing.</p>
<p>Well, after living there for half a year, although the monthly income was not enough to support my family, I gained a little more life experience! I left there last winter. According to commercial custom, this is the time when a career should be at its peak, but who knew that the opposite was true: Nanjing, although a place where officials gather, could not escape the attack of recession. In order to maintain the situation that was about to collapse, most stores, large and small, had to implement a policy of "layoffs and salary reductions," and many male staff members in our store returned home one after another under these recessionary circumstances. Because there were only two female staff members, laying them off might be too obvious; therefore, I and another female colleague managed to maintain the external image (?) without shaking. But although layoffs did not fall on me, salary reductions were inevitable. My monthly salary was originally twenty-four yuan, but it was reduced by six yuan. This was a very big loss for me, so after continuing to work there for a month, I resigned without hesitation.</p>
<p>When my family came to Shanghai, it was the Lunar New Year with drums and music; people were frantically looking for happiness, but I guarded a shadow of life and worried at home. Thus, it was not until July of this year that I saw an advertisement in the newspaper for "female guides"—of course, I also saw other advertisements, but they were all empty runs—the qualifications were not too high, so I decided to try my luck.</p>
<p>On the day of the exam, men and women crowded into a room, roughly two or three hundred people; although they did not know each other, the mood of competing for a living was the same. The exam was divided into written and oral tests. The written test was very simple, so everyone handed in their papers effortlessly. The oral test was more troublesome, and many people left before the end of the session. The examiner was from Guangdong, but spoke very good dialects from various places. He would ask each examinee a few questions in Beijing dialect for a while, and then ask a few questions in Hunan dialect; if the examinee could answer quickly, there was hope of being accepted. The oral test questions, in addition to focusing on dialects, mostly used the names of local streets as the subject matter. For example, he asked, "Where is Ximen?" You have to say it quickly, and you also have to know how to take a car to get there.</p>
<p>That kind of oral test seemed very simple, but in the end only twelve people were admitted. Because I had lived in Shanghai for seven years, I could still speak a few Shanghai dialects that were not awkward, even as a Cantonese; I had been to Nanjing since I was seven years old, so speaking Nanjing dialect was naturally no problem; as for Beijing dialect, I had already learned it in school before. That day I went to the exam, and I was all thanks to this advantage, so I was not eliminated.</p>
<p>I have only been working here for three weeks, and I can't say whether the prospects are good or bad, but the novelty of this occupation makes me feel extremely interested. There are more than twenty colleagues here, including twelve female "guides" and ten males. Because of the nature of the job, we are not often together, so there is no such environment as when I was a clerk in Nanjing. The company does not discriminate against me in terms of treatment. The working hours for men and women are all from 9:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. Food is provided by the company, and the monthly salary is based on commissions. The guiding fee is 75 cents per hour, and we can get 60% of it as a commission, including transportation costs.</p>
<p>How much income there is each month in this way is of course impossible to calculate at present, but based on the standard of my income for the first half of the month, the monthly income is probably more than forty yuan. This is certainly considered one of the better occupations for women today, but there are still many "guides" who do not have this much income.</p>
<p>The purpose of this company and the scope of our services is to guide the following types of people: (1) those who have just arrived in Shanghai and want to tour the Shanghai urban area and nearby scenic spots, (2) those who are passing through Shanghai by boat or car and have some time to stay and want to visit friends or shop but have no one to lead them, (3) those who have lived in Shanghai for a long time and are tired of the hustle and bustle of the city and feel lonely traveling alone and want to take a suburban trip to entertain their mind and eyes." I have only been working in this company for three weeks, and based on my little experience, I feel that most of the people who want to find us as guides are still people who live in Shanghai, which is an undeniable fact. Because this business is still a "newborn," everyone is curious and wants to try it out, and the implementation of this business is spearheaded by women. In the current situation where the mentality of considering women as "toys" has not been fundamentally eliminated, it is predictable that this guiding business can flourish for a while. Also because of this reason, many people are worried about me. They think that it is very inconvenient for women to be "guides," and only women with courage (?) would dare to do this kind of occupation. I dare not say that these arguments are not knowledgeable insights and want to refute them; but I always feel that "it depends on the person," and there is no way to prevent people from ruining the reputation of a business. For example, our service scope stipulates in the third item: "Those who have lived in Shanghai for a long time and are tired of the hustle and bustle of the city, feel lonely traveling alone, and want to take a suburban trip to entertain their mind and eyes, please call the company, and we will send someone to guide you immediately." This is clearly to accompany people on trips to the suburbs to make their body and mind happy. May I ask, what is the difference between this behavior and the meaning of a female nurse in a hospital taking care of a sick person with all her heart? This is my view of my current occupation, so I think it is a legitimate occupation.</p>
<p>Common Sense</p>
<h3>Mineral Resources of Inner Mongolia</h3>
<p>— Zhou Leshan</p>
<p>(1) Coal</p>
<p>According to the 1934 edition of the "China Economic Yearbook," the coal production in Mongolia was: Chahar 114,500 tons (1931), Suiyuan 91,200 tons (same year), and the output in Ningxia is unknown. The total production in the first two regions was 205,700 tons, only one-fortieth of the production in Hebei Province. The coal reserves in Chahar were 50.4 million tons, with Xuanhua, Weixian, Aolai, and Zhangbei counties as the main producing areas. Most of the coal mines in Inner Mongolia are privately owned. The only government-run operation was a trial coal mine near Shaba, Zhangbei, established in 1919. However, this mine was unsuccessful due to low production, limited sales, and frequent local incidents, and it ceased operations several years ago. The mine area covered approximately 12,288 acres, with the shallow deposits already exhausted. Deep mining was not possible due to technical limitations.</p>
<p>A portion of the coal produced in Chahar was transported to Tianjin and Beijing, but the quantity was very small, with the majority being consumed within the province.</p>
<p>Next, we turn to Suiyuan. Many small coal mines are scattered in the mountain valleys of the Daqing Mountains. The coal seams contain Jurassic sandstone, with seven layers ranging from one to nine feet thick. In the foothills, the crustal movement is significant, and the coal seams are vertical. The quality of the coal varies across different regions. The coal produced north of Qingshuihe is fragmented anthracite. From Batu Gulou north of Salachi to the Da Xigou area north of Baotou, the coal is all bituminous coal suitable for manufacturing soft coal, with an annual production of about 150,000 tons. The western part of the Daqing Mountain coalfield produces bituminous coal similar to that from the Datong coalfield. These are horizontal layers, making them easier to mine. Currently, there are 41 operating coal mines of various sizes in Suiyuan Province. The largest is the Shiguai Gulou coal mine in Mianyang County. This mine is located approximately 60 miles northeast of Baotou and covers an area of about 60 square miles. It is famous for producing high-quality bituminous coal. The coal seams consist of three layers, separated by 50 to 200 feet of carbonaceous shale. The first layer is three to five feet thick, the second layer is seven to eight feet thick, and the third layer is four to ten feet thick. Mining is done using primitive local methods, so areas with high water content in the deep sections cannot be mined and are abandoned. The reserves in this mining area are estimated at 70 to 80 million tons. In addition to bituminous coal, some anthracite is also produced.</p>
<p>Currently, all operating coal mines use primitive methods. From where the coal seam is exposed on ordinary mountain slopes, large tunnels are dug along the seam. The tunnels are approximately four to five feet high and five to six feet wide. From there, mining proceeds to the left and right, with miscellaneous wood used as support for the tunnels to extract the coal. The extracted large pieces of coal are carried by miners on their shoulders, and coal dust is transported using scales and baskets. On average, three miners can extract over two tons of coal per day. A large mine has over a hundred miners and can extract approximately 50 to 60 tons per day. There are also many small-scale operations with dozens or even just a few miners. Because the scale is small and the mining methods are primitive, there are no ventilation or drainage facilities, so deep mining is impossible. As a result, it is common to abandon tunnels halfway to reach richer areas of the coalfield and seek new tunnels. The largest mining areas are estimated to be about 60 to 70 acres.</p>
<p>In terms of transportation, they rely solely on pack animals. Due to the lack of transportation infrastructure, they often have to abandon good mines. The distances from the coal mines to the plains are: Zhu'er Gulou 10 miles, Da Xigou 15 miles, Wanjia Gulou 40 miles, Shuijian Gulou 30 miles, Batu Gulou 25 miles, and Wudang Gulou and Shiguai Gulou (to Baotou) 60 miles each. For example, the Shiguai mine is located more than 60 miles northeast of Baotou. Transportation relies entirely on carts pulled by oxen and horses, so the round trip from Shiguai to Baotou takes three days, and the freight cost is five to six yuan per ton. The original price of coal at the mine is two to six yuan per ton. Assuming a freight cost of two yuan, the original price upon arrival in Baotou would be eight yuan, so the coal from the Daqing Mountains cannot compete with the coal from Datong.</p>
<p>(2) Salt</p>
<p>The Mongolian plateau is dotted with numerous landlocked lakes and marshes, and the climate is extremely dry with strong evaporation, resulting in highly saline lake water. Inner Mongolia to Xinjiang is rich in rock salt, especially Qinghai produces particularly a lot, and is not subject to salt tax.</p>
<p>The main salt lakes in Inner Mongolia are: A, Northern Chahar - Dali Lake (circumference 40 miles), Da Bu Su Nuoer (circumference 40 miles), Gurban Nuoer, and Xiwuzhumuqin. B, Central Chahar - Da Bu Su Ma Dai Nuoer (circumference 1 mile), located in Dongsunite Banner, covered with several feet of salt layer. There are several other salt lakes in this area. C, Southern Chahar - Tai Lake and Hulu Lake, circumference of over 50 miles, containing high concentrations of salt. D, Ordos region - Da Ye Haizi, approximately 8 miles in length and 0.5 to 2 miles in width, with rich salt deposits in its eastern part. In addition, there are several salt lakes in Hangjin Banner and Natok Banner in the same region. E, Eastern Alxa - Jilantai Salt Pond and Chalatay Salt Pond, are the most famous salt lakes in Northwest China. The latter is approximately 23 miles in circumference, with a beautiful salt layer two to six feet thick covering the lake surface, creating a magnificent view.</p>
<p>The Meng salt production from Da Bu Su Nuoer Lake in northern Chahar, described below, illustrates that salt has historically been an important commodity for local trade. Da Bu Su Nuoer produces a large amount of salt, averaging about 250,000 dan per year, and the salt is of good quality. Da Bu Su Nuoer is located at the intersection of Xiwuzhumuqin and Donghoqite Banners in Xilin Gol League, approximately 120 kilometers northwest of the Xiwuzhumuqin Banner Wangfu. The lake is an oval funnel shape, longer from east to west and shorter from north to south. The long axis is approximately 10 li, the short axis is approximately 4 li, and the circumference is approximately 16 li. Counting in miles, it is a full 100 li, hence the name "Hundred-Li Lake." Several kilometers from the lake shore, it is surrounded by hills on all sides. The lake water is approximately two feet deep, with some shallows in the eastern and southern parts. There are many circular depressions within the lake, with varying depths depending on their size, ranging from 15 to 10 meters in diameter. Inside, there are salt vents about two feet in diameter, constantly spewing muddy water containing salt. The muddy water crystallizes, forming salt layers around it. The salt forms white sedimentary crystals on the lake bottom, and the withered grass floating on the water is also covered in snow-white, resembling beautiful flowers. There are many theories about the cause of the salt water spring. It is generally believed that there is a deep rock salt layer at the bottom of the lake, which dissolves when spring water emerges and carries it. The soil at the bottom of the lake is dark cyan clay, so even ox carts loaded with salt will not sink.</p>
<p>To the south and east of the salt lake, there are salt mining routes leading into the heart of the lake, used by oxen and horses. About two li from the lake, there are tax collection offices in the Xiwuzhumuqin and Donghoqite Banners. Around the offices are approximately 20 yurts inhabited by salt miners. Da Bu Su Nuoer Lake is jointly owned by the Xiwuzhumuqin and Donghoqite Banners. The residents of the two banners can freely mine salt, but residents of other banners are taxed. The residents of these banners regard this lake as sacred and forbid Han Chinese from approaching the lake shore. In addition to the residents of the above-mentioned two banners, most of the salt miners are Mongols from Keshiketeng and Bairin Banners. The salt mining season is from April to September each year. They bring their salt mining tools, food, and tents loaded on oxen and horses. At peak times, there are hundreds of them. The salt mining method is very simple. Loose salt is scooped up with a winnowing basket, and block salt is crushed with a shovel. A bullock cart can carry 300-400 catties. In addition, camels and mules are also used. A camel can carry about 300 catties, and a mule can carry about 70 catties.</p>
<p>This salt lake is a gift from heaven to the residents of the two banners, and there are many deep spots in the lake, so it is essential to employ exclusive salt miners from these two banners when mining salt. During the peak salt mining season around July and August, there are about 100 salt miners from each of the two banners, and their work is quite relaxed. On a good day, they can mine five or six carts of salt. When there is a big rainstorm, they can only mine two or three carts of salt.</p>
<p>(4) Other Mineral Resources</p>
<p>Among the natural resources of Inner Mongolia, alkali is as important as rock salt. Alkali is produced in Sifeng Nuoer (near Duolun Nuoer) in the Zhenglan Banner of the Chahar League in Chahar, Dachahan, Dadagang, Baiyan Nuoer, Shilu Nuoer, and Hetu Nuoer in the Zhengblai Banner, Yi Qie Nuoer in the Xiangbai Banner, Etok Banner and Hangjin Banner in the Yikezhao League in Suiyuan, and Helingeer County. Alkali is mostly formed from salt lakes. When it rains, the alkali in the soil dissolves. Soon, with the evaporation of the water, white alkali crystals remain on the edge of the lake. The reserves are extremely rich. The alkali-producing area in Suiyuan alone is 1,750 square li. Etok Banner has two lakes in the east and west. The bottom of the lakes is crystallized, with a thickness of one foot. The annual production is approximately 7,950 tons in Chahar and 1,800 tons in Suiyuan. The alkali produced in Chahar is mostly imported into China through Zhangjiakou, while the alkali produced in Suiyuan is mostly consumed in the Suiyuan Province area. In</p>

<p>Zhangjiakou, the price for delivery is about six yuan per ton.</p>
<p>In both Chahar and Suiyuan provinces, the iron ore reserves are quite rich. The more accurate estimate of iron ore reserves in Chahar is 45,645,000 tons, and other estimates are 46,000,000 tons, totaling 91,645,000 tons, ranking first among all provinces in China. The reserves in Suiyuan are approximately 85,000,000 tons. The iron ore deposits in Chahar start from Yanjian Mountain in Xuanhua County and are concentrated in the Xinyao and Pangjiabao areas of Longguan County. The mining rights in this area are exclusively held by the Longyan Iron Mine Company, a joint venture between the government and private sector (with a capital of 5 million yuan). For mining purposes, the company has built a dedicated railway line from Xuanhua Station on the PingSui Railway and has established an iron smelting plant in Shijingshan, Hebei Province (west of Beiping). Iron is also produced in Wuchuan, Eyou, Guyang, Salachi, Qingshuihe, and Baotou in Suiyuan. It is said that Guyang County has deposits of 700,000 tons, and Baiyun Mountain in Wuchuan County has deposits of 10,000,000 tons. However, due to the continued use of old smelting methods, the annual production is only 100 tons.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Xuanhua County in Chahar produces 1,800 catties of sulfur near Wangjialou and Huzhuangzi, worth approximately 300 yuan, which is used for sulfuric acid, gunpowder, fertilizer paper making, etc. Sulfur is also produced in the Jurassic coal seams of the Daqing Mountains in Guyang and Wuchuan Counties in Suiyuan, but the production volume is unknown.</p>
<p>Asbestos is also produced in Chahar, but the production status is unclear. Suiyuan is the main producing area. It is produced in Wuchuan, Salachi, Guyang, Baotou, Guisui, Anbei counties and administrative bureaus, Chahar Right Wing Banner, Ulanqab League Donggong Banner, Urat Banner, Yikezhao League banners, and the Qingshuihe area. The reserves on the Daqing Mountains alone are 680,000 tons. Rongfeng Company and Gongjin Zhan, which have branches in Baotou, operate mines in various locations, but the annual production is very low, only around 20 tons.</p>
<p>Other minerals include antimony, produced in Etok Banner in Suiyuan; magnetic clay, produced in Guyang and Qingshuihe counties (annual production of 2,000 tons); graphite, produced in Guisui and Xinghe counties; gems, alabaster, and crystals, produced in Taolin, Guyang, Xinghe counties, and various locations in Chahar, but the mining status and annual production are unknown.</p>
<p>Lecture on Natural Science</p>
<h3>The Reality of Mathematics</h3>
<p>— Yu Cheng</p>
<p>Mathematics, the most abstract science in the natural sciences, studies only the quantitative relationships of the material world. However, it is very clear that what we can directly perceive are all unified combinations of quality and quantity. Stripped of quality and solely possessing quantity, it becomes something that cannot be seen, heard, touched, only imagined, although it is still one aspect of objective reality. Because of this, mathematics becomes the most abstract knowledge, merely an abstract study of the quantitative relationships of real qualities. Precisely because of this particularity of mathematics, scholars of general conceptualism believe that mathematics is merely an a priori formula of thought, a science of the logical forms of thought, without its objective reality, and not subject to any reflection of objective reality but originating spontaneously in subjective thought. They might even say it is a congenital, eternal logical form, or that the logical form of the cosmic spirit is understood by mankind and produced. Therefore, Kantian mathematicians regard mathematical axioms as a priori, existing before experience, and even great mathematicians like Descartes and Leibniz believed that mathematical axioms are innate, existing without relying on experience and the reflection of reality.</p>
<p>However, from the perspective of new science, although mathematics is a very abstract science, it still originates in the objective real world. Mankind's construction of the logical forms of these quantitative relationships is a reflection of the quantitative logical forms of the objective real world, not originating a priori from one's own soul or the soul of the universe. Of course, once this concept of number and its logical forms have been abstracted by mankind and acquired certain basic general laws, mankind often no longer uses the quantitative facts of real matter as a comparison, but develops it independently, and even turns around and uses this logic to discover the quantitative relationships and laws of nature itself. For example, modern science relies on mathematical calculations to determine the types and sequences of atoms to create the periodic table, relies on mathematical calculations to determine the size of atoms, electrons, and quanta, develops physics, and relies on mathematical calculations to promote the progress of astronomy, chemistry, and even economics. But in any case, first, mathematical concepts and their laws are always the laws of quantity of real things in the objective world, and when these concepts and laws are initially obtained, they are still compared from real objects with unified qualities. A savage can only count to twenty because he only has twenty toes and fingers, and he must move his fingers to count, which is an example of the objective origin of the concept of number. Second, after mankind has obtained the most basic mathematical laws through preliminary abstraction, even if they can use thought to more abstractly develop these laws, departing from the comparison of the logical forms of the quantity of real matter and creating many formulas and axioms, these things must still depend on the quantitative relationships of real matter to be correct and suitable for application, and only by being able to turn around and apply them to nature and explain nature can they become mathematical formulas and axioms. The reason we can use mathematical principles to reverse and deal with natural things is precisely because it has this kind of objective reality and is consistent with the laws of quantity in nature.</p>
<p>Here, let us put aside theory and use facts to illustrate. The addition of many single quantities, the subtraction of many single quantities from a total quantity, and even the multiplication of products based on a certain multiple are the most real things in the natural material world. A row of thirty people with five new recruits or five soldiers who deserted, this is a change in the increase and decrease of the total quantity of real objects. Mathematicians can certainly use addition and subtraction to deal with it, and even a child, although he does not understand mathematical addition and subtraction, can use his direct realistic feelings and prior experience to recognize this change, because this is because the realistic situation itself shows its laws of quantity. Atoms and molecules gather a number of single electrons, and atoms become their own totality. Atoms also emit a number of single electrons, reducing their original mass. This is matter itself carrying out realistic addition and subtraction. Atoms constitute their weight based on twice their own atomic number, and atoms below the iron atom roughly form their atomic weights based on a certain multiple of four times the helium atom. This is again natural matter carrying out real multiplication. If you want to ask where the mathematical concepts of all geometric shapes come from, then we will answer that this is a reflection of the spatial forms, regular and irregular, of many real substances. Because crystals themselves can form various regular crystalline geometric shapes, and bees can blindly follow the laws of nature to create hexagonal bottom nests. A straight line does not need to be assumed to be the result of an ideal point moving without bending. However, if any object is not affected and controlled by the gravitational and repulsive forces of other objects in the entire universe, its movement can indeed draw a very straight line. According to the new physics, the path of light can bend, but only when it passes through a region with spatial curvature formed by other objects, such as passing near the sun, will it bend its path. A projectile naturally draws a parabolic curve under the action of gravity, and a planet naturally draws an ellipse under the action of the mutual gravitational and repulsive forces between it and the sun. A real right-angled triangle and a rectangular plate can form a cone and a cylinder, respectively, by rotating any side of the triangle and any side of the rectangle. Isn't it clear that all kinds of geometric forms can be derived without mathematicians having to create them in their minds?</p>
<p>Everything that is produced in a calculation formula or in the logical forms of mathematics can also be found in the real world. For example, the sum of two numbers, one positive and one negative, is often the difference between the two numbers, and whether the nature of the sum is positive or negative depends on which of the two numbers is larger. This kind of quantitative relationship can be found everywhere in real things. In mechanics, when two forces of different magnitudes but opposite directions act together on an object, the object's movement often goes in the direction of the larger force, and the force on the object and the effect it produces are often equivalent to the difference between the two forces, which is one example. For example, in the structure of an atom, whether the atom belongs to positive electricity or negative electricity completely depends on the stronger amount of charge carried by the positive nucleus and the electron, and the intensity of its polar electricity is also determined by the amount of their difference. From this, it can be seen that before mathematicians came up with the above formula, nature had already been working according to this formula.</p>
<p>In short, mathematics is not a pre-existing logical form in the minds of mathematicians. The concepts of number and shape "are completely obtained from the outside world... The object of number is the spatial form and quantitative relationship of the real world, so it is very real material." It is "a law abstracted from the real world, and at a certain stage of development, it becomes detached from the real world and becomes a kind of independent thing, an external law that the world must be subject to, and opposed to the real world." But "pure mathematics is always applicable to the world later. It originally came from this world, but it is only a part of the relational form that constitutes the world, and that is why it can be applied to the world." Without the logical form of the quantity of the real world, there would be no mathematics. If it cannot conform to the logic of the quantity of the real world and therefore cannot reverse and deal with the quantity of nature, then it cannot be considered mathematics.</p>
<h3>Introduction to Guo Butao's New Book "On Common Principles"</h3>
<p>— Price 20 cents, published by the Xinwen Bao —</p>
<p>In today's international atmosphere filled with the clouds of war, most writers in various countries are publishing pessimistic and negative views in books and newspapers. At the same time, some writers are using a positive attitude to inspire people's anti-war sentiments for world peace. However, in our country, there are still very few active works for world peace like this. "On Common Principles" by Guo Butao, a commentator at the Xinwen Bao, can be said to belong to this category. This small book is full of humanitarian enthusiasm, and makes psychological reflections on the method of saving the world from "murderous intent." The author believes that human society has several common principles that have remained unchanged for thousands of years. As long as everyone has a thorough understanding of these principles, world peace can be realized. He divides the so-called common principles into three parts: "the right to life," "the meaning of life," and "responsibility" to explain them. Although what he says seems broad, the concept given to readers is very clear. We can say that this small book is an accurate guide to world peace. If we, who are in modern times, are aware of our due duties to world peace, we cannot miss this book.</p>

<h3>Overseas Chinese Around the World (12)</h3>
<p>— Zhong Minyi</p>
<p>South America</p>
<p>There are more overseas Chinese in South America than in Central America. There are thousands in British Guiana, 3,000 in Chile, 20,000 in Brazil, and 40,000 to 50,000 in Peru - at its peak, there were as many as 100,000. Among them, workers are the most numerous, followed by merchants. In recent years, except for Brazil, which treats overseas Chinese well, other South American countries have been trying their best to exclude our compatriots.</p>
<p>West Indies</p>
<p>The West Indies consist of more than twenty islands in total. The large island of Cuba in the west is a relatively well-known country that we often see in newspapers. In 1887, more than 50,000 Chinese workers were transported here, and later increased to more than 114,000. They were all subjected to abuse, and their treatment was like that of black slaves, so most of the Chinese workers who went to Cuba died soon. After the Spanish-American War in 1898, Cuba became a protectorate of the United States, and the entry of Chinese workers was prohibited. However, even now, there are still about 100,000 overseas Chinese in Cuba, mostly laborers and small merchants.</p>
<p>In addition to Cuba, there are also thousands of overseas Chinese in Trinidad and Jamaica in the West Indies, and there are also a small number of overseas Chinese in Martinique (French) and Curacao (Dutch), who are all engaged in business or work.</p>
