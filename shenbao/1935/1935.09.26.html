<p>時評產業證劵交易方法之商權</p>
<p>— 磐</p>
<p>工商業復興委員會。最近特組小組委員會討論籌碼問題。並擬具意見書。闡述吾國目下金融體系之病態。主張於短期資金市塲。利用票據以代替放賬制度。於長期資金市塲則以產業證券之流通後發展途徑。自今春以來。各業於商　承兌匯票。正在積極推行而銀行。業者亦有銀行承兌票據之計擬。是前項主張。不久可望實施矣。至後一問題。則據報載由該委員會與華商證券交易所接洽。開拍公司股票及債券。然就我人觀察。恐非最短期間所能收其實效耳。</p>
<p>華商　券交易所之開拍公司股票。與債票以前曾有數次。乃皆不及數日。中止拍板。蓋所市塲業。為政府公債庫券所獨占。客戶興趣。叢集於此。且公債庫券之投資。經二十餘年之官傳提倡。民間已有相當認。散戶營者因亦甚衆。反之。股票交易過去雖時有暗盤成交。然投資之興趣。僅限於某種人物。未能若公債庫券之普遍。良以公司事業。彼互異。卽屬同一企業。其經營技巧。亦有高下之差。股票投資者。設非有深切乏關係。與特殊之究。於對象選擇。頗非易易目。今老工商業復興委員會因求產業證券之流通。而謀畸形證券市塲之健全。用意誠至深長。惟今次開拍。竊以為首先宜有充分之準備。與周密之技術設計。如拍板股票表須兼收並蓄。務求廣博。證券等級亦應評定。以供投資者之參考。並宜設立研究機關。以利經紀人之咨詢。至拍板市塲。更應以獨立為原則。若能另設現貨證券市場。添加現貨經紀人名額。則成效當可期待。設乃一本已往政策。附屬期貨市塲。亦前車可鑒　。</p>
<p>至若公司債票之發行與拍板。困難更甚於前。就過去一年而論。公司債發行之踴躍。實開鼎革　來之新紀錄。就我人所知。如閘北水電公司債票四百五十萬元。六河溝煤礦公司第二次債票二白五十萬元。啟新洋灰公司債票一百九十萬，。永利化學工業公司債票四百萬元。江南鐵路公司債票二百萬元。民生實業公司第次債票一百萬元。茂昌冷氣公司債票六十萬元等為數皆頗可觀。此項債票。雖經公開勸募。大抵均歸銀行承受。民間承購者實寥寥無幾。若此。則公司債票之發行。與普通抵押借　。實無二　。且上述各種公司債利率。以年息一分為最高。發行價格。除汀南鐵路公司債票情形特殊外。大抵皆有九五左右。此則與政府證券相較。怕處不利之地位。此為例。公司債卽能發行。而拍板之窒碍。仍宜謀相當　决。否借欵之名兒雖給。債票之呆滯依然。畏期有金市塲機構十之缺陷。恐仍難予以補救耳。</p>

<p>中央社云、振務委員會委員長許世英日　赴京轉蘇北視察各縣水災情形、業於前日（二十三日）夜快車由京返滬、於昨晨抵達後、卽與本市籌募各　水災義振會諸負責人洽商繼續籌募辦法、及查放振欵振物事宜、中央社記者昨日下午、往訪許氏於水災義　會、據談、視察經過及救濟辦法如次、</p>
<p>蘇北水患尙難樂觀</p>
<p>據許氏云、本人自離滬後、在京稍作勾留、卽行轉赴蘇北視察水災情形、　次水災悉係由於黃河漲水、在魯未能堵口、以致由微山湖奪淮河而入運河、不老河、所經之處、均泛濫成災、故蘇北流　部、山東一日不堵口、江蘇之水災卽一日不止、現水勢轉退、但無妥善善後辦法、仍未能樂觀、</p>
<p>邳銅沛豐受災最甚</p>
<p>此次水災、幸在秋間、皆農產物均已成熟、急予收取、　響羅小、但財　招失已不在少、如水勢不卽退落、則新種難下、難免叨年春荒、至於受災區域、計有邳銅沛豐等四縣、而以邳縣為最甚、幾十之八九、盡被淹沒、</p>
<p>導黃入海正籌辦法</p>

<p>籌募賬欵繼續進行</p>
<p>自黃河長江、先後發生水災、振務四萬五千元、由受災各省放振、本人此次赴蘇北、携欵一萬一千七百九十四元、前往散放、義振會方面已籌有振欵十八萬、仍陸續捐募振會、當隨時匯交各省查放、以備急需、</p>

<p>中央社云本埠地產業、因受市面不景氣影響、致進出日稀、大有良好地產無人過問之慨、地產業頒袖、雖一再設法救濟、終無辦法、擁有大批地產者、莫不愁眉蹙額、亟謀早日脫手、茲據記者向該業中探悉各情如次、</p>
<p>黃金時代過去　地產業在民國十八年至二十年、為全盛時代、較良　產、此爭彼奪、價値飛漲不已、南京路外灘等處地價、每畝竟達五十萬元以上、自二十年以後、遂漸衰落、迄二十二年至現在、更年不如年、目下南京路外灘等處地價、雖無標準、大約其所値較之該業黃金時代、僅及其半、致此之由、一言蔽之、市面不景氣使然、但亦有種種原因在、例如地產商人、因地產無交易、每將地產向銀行押欽、逾期不贖發生糾紛、引起訴訟者甚多、於是人心每因噎而廢食、對於地產都　敢過問、愈使該業營業益形停頓、而所値亦日落矣、</p>
<p>一再設法無效　目下地產業之現象、於社會經濟關係已鉅、今後趨勢若何、更可顧慮、該業中領袖救濟計、曾一再設法卒無成效、今春、該業巨商稈霖生等、曾計議發行地產流通券五萬萬元、卒因不獲各方贊助而未成、最近、該業中人又計議在海上籌設地產交易所、此舉正在計議中、但預測此舉决不獲準於政府、蓋地產交易所、果能獲準設立、則風潮之鼓動、將層出不窮、人心因之不安、而市面金融、將因之發生影響、此乃勢所必然也</p>
<p>地產幾無進出　地產業之衰落、决不可任其趨勢而不加救濟　救濟之道、决非該業中一二領袖　專憑一己之利害、今日計議發行地產流通券、明日計議籌設地產交易所、當邀集中外專家、會同當局、及地產業有識之士、共同商討庶有益於整個地產業、否則該業前途、將益形慘淡、目下本埠地產營業、較大地產、兩三月來、幾無進出、零星進出、亦寥寥無幾、此不特擁產者損失、卽賴以為生者之生計、亦已發生問題、</p>
<p>减租理所當然　際此地產衰落之時、而房客請求减租之聲浪、又此起彼應、目下本市房相、大多數仍依照地產業黃金時代之租價、彼時地價與現在相較、相差幾達半數房租之减價、理所當然、房客要求减租、一由於百業凋疲、社會經濟衰落、二由於市上空房增多、而市上空房增多、非市民之减少、實因擁有地產者、鑒於地皮不易脫手、乃爭造市房、於是供過於求、此亦地產業衰落現象之一也云、</p>

<p>（七）新信用籌碼在金融市塲之運用金融制度之進步、於力量集中周轉靈活中見之、而信用制度之進步、則端在化呆滯爲流通、雖然、所謂進步云者、仍須以國民經濟之改進爲前提、故若過去滬市之地產繁榮、雖曾化呆滯為流通、然不足以言進步也、</p>
<p>同一信用賣買也、循舊式放賬制度、則呆滯立見、故一改為票據承兌、即可變呆滯為流通矣、此種技術的改進、表面上區別幾微、而涵義則甚遠大、亦猶之壺中蒸氣、一導入汽機、竟不期而為人類文明劃時代的動力也、吾國金融業目下固亦有甚多之放欵、徒以忽於技術的改進、呆滯者遂未能變為流通伺人之意、以為吾人欲建立現代的信用制度、惟有就下列三點、推行上述現代的信用籌碼、甲·以承受公司債票方式、代替目下之廠基押欵、</p>

<p>商業承兌匯票、目下上上第市商會、已在稱極提倡之中、綢緞業及電機絲織廠業同業公會、並已首先實行、其辦法、係山工商業家於賒賣買物之際、不似目下辦法、僅於蓋取回音之後、登記賬冊、使之成為一種呆滯賬面之債權、而改用發行匯票使買方為之承兌之手續、使之成為可以流通之票面債權、承兌後之匯票、即可持向金融業貼現、以取得資金之通融、金融業貼現是項票據條之後、亦可以需要時以再貼現方式、取得資金之通融、故在東西各國、商業承兌匯票、亦成爲金融業之第二準備金、以視目下之信用放欵、旣多危險、又極呆滯、眞不啻天壤矣、</p>
<p>金融業之放資方式、依上述三端加以改造之後、長期資金市塲畸形之發展、自可逐漸轉移、產業證券市塲、即可樹立、而短期資金市塲、亦完全台理化現代化、其結果、除使呆滯者變為流通而外、其長期資金之通融、旣因產業證券之發行而公開、短期資金之通融、亦可以承兌及轉貼現金額中、覘其膨脹與緊縮之大勢、防患未然、得所取準、較之目下各自為政各不相謀之放資、使信用擴張、漫無限制、恐慌循環、週期加促者、其進步又豈可以道理計耶、（未完）</p>

<p>信用籌碼與决算須知</p>
<p>國貨界最近有兩大問題，應急急注意者，厥為工商業復興委員會發表之（一）增加籌碼問題意見，（二）工商機關辦理决算須知，此兩問題，經該會小組會議數次之討論，始揭藥於社會，我國貨界應切實承受努力研究，為今後業務上開一新紀錄：</p>
<p>（一）信用籌碼之不足，已為國人一致所公認，我國貨界大率能以數萬元之資本，經營數十萬元之營業者，其生命綫之存在，何莫非信用籌碼之是賴。今以金融緊迫，而縮小信用籌碼？用途，我國貨界所受之影響最巨。目下工商業復興委員會，旣有擴展信用籌碼之貢獻，我國貨界應與金融界誠意合作，實行（一）以承受公司債票方式，代替目下之廠某押欵。（二）以銀行承兌匯票代替目下之動產押欵。（三）以商業承兌匯票之貼現，代替目下之信用押欵。而實行之先，尤須研究管理，充實力量，精製出品，减低成本，以取信於金融業與實心提倡國貨之同志。否則，內容腐敗，營業衰歇，任何設施，徒勞無濟，此國貨界應行注意者一。</p>
<p>（二）工商機關之辦理决算，爲最重要之事業，但向來工商界所辦手續均屬未安。如折舊之提存，呆帳之準備，股息之作爲開支，現金結存中之包含客賬，及各項票據，嚴格而論，俱不相宜，今工商業復興委員會，能注意於此，訂請會計專家商定辦理决算須知一份，示會計員以應由之途　，與應有之準繩，此其婢益於國貨工廠者甚大，希望各工廠當局，急起注意實行，一掃以前一篇糊塗帳之禍患。辦理决算不難，而難在適於會計之制度興合於公平之原則。此應注意者二。</p>
<p>以上所陳極為重要，國民果能無求於人而發揮盡其在我之精神，則國貨界一綫之生機舍此奚屬。</p>
<h3 id="c138">奢侈品大量進口的危機 <a href="#c138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>— 玄萬</p>
<p>這幾年來我國的龐大入超，大家知道是為我們整個民族經濟破產的致命傷。但是·入超這名詞，似乎太籠統，還有加以詳細分析的必要，因為我國是一個產業十分落後的國家，所以在全部的入超中，這裏邊却正還包括有許多發展國產所必須的機器和材料等，這種東西，我們當然一定要很好的利用他，為改良現時的生產，推進中國經濟到完全自給自足的階段去的張本。</p>
<p>可是，我在這裏要特別指出的，就是於這全部的入超中，却發現了歷年來舶來奢侈品的大量進口的危機，而我這裏所謂的奢侈品，是更包含一切香水·脂粉·化裝品·眞假首飾·捲烟·雪茄烟·各種酒類·汽水·糖菓·魚翅·燕窩等都在內的·這些東西，在民窮財盡的現下，本來是小應該再有這樣巨大的消耗，但。事實勝於雄辯，像去年十婦女國貨年中，却反發現了一百多萬元的化裝品進口數，鬧成莫大的話柄，就是到今年，市面益加奄無生氣，國貨工廠的營業，更加困　的時候，而日前據報紙上吿訴我們，化妝品的進口，依然源源不絕，他的統計，比較去年僅僅减少了百分之十五，我想這是無論誰也一定不能感得滿意，而覺得國貨運動的前途，尙須更大的努力吧！</p>
<p>並且，我在日前大公報經濟週列上又看到谷源田先生「吾人對於减少國際貿易入超應有的覺悟」一文內，附着民國二十三年來奢侈品値與入超値的一張比較表，據他的統計，這許多年來的奢侈品値竟佔入超總値百分之二二强，足見得國人消耗奢侈品的數量，是委實可驚，雖然說其中也有一部份楚在華外僑所消費，但是他的數量，决不會這般多，我國還在產業這般落後的時代，而却有這樣大的消費，正是一種最可怕的現象，假如國人能早點認識時艱，大家肯省吃儉用，努力生產建設，將所有的奢侈品入超，都變成機械，材料等生產品；那末我想中國經濟的發展，一定早有了相當的成績，但是國人却背道而行，這是給我們如何嚴肅的感想，而要大家急於設法更努力國貨運動，儉約運動來挽救他。</p>
<p>我們曉得奢侈品的消耗者，大都是都市的資產階級們，他們有着很豐富的學識。國家到了這般的地步，你們大家可以醒醒吧！</p>

<p>— 茸餘</p>
<p>走到人家屋子裏去瞧瞧，他們所用的茶壼茶杯，上等的是西洋貨，再次的是東洋貨。問他們為甚麽不用中國貨？異口同聲的說道：「江西貨價錢太貴了，而且也並不精緻呀！記得在我做小孩子的時候，所玩的玩具總是泥做的「大阿福」「文昌」「財神」等類，約了幾個小伴侶，齋齋模佛，倒也蠻有味道，現在孩子們玩的東西不對了，甚麽洋囡囡咧！橡皮動物咧！汽槍咧！眞是五花八門，比從前有趣得多了。可惜這許多東西，大半不是準國貨。為了這二種感觸，使我不得不想起「宜興窰和「惠山土」了，因此略述一些意見五下面：</p>
<p>宜興是江蘇省的一個縣分，所產的泥是細凈多黏性，所以拿來做窰胚，要算是上好的材料。這地的窰戶，是專製茶壺茶杯，所以宜興茶壺，也可算是名聞天下。泥的顏色是紫紅，所以燒成的東西，也是這種顏色，古色古香，倒也令人可愛。倘使精細的東西，再上了一層精彩，那末紅黃藍白，隨心所欲了。我以為宜興產的茶壺茶杯，貨色並不退板，可惜現　製造的工人，還墨守舊法，以致出品慢而成本也高。倘使用了科學的方法，增進速率；再用專門的人才，加以改良，宜興的茶壺茶杯，怕不駕外貨而上之。還希當地的窰戶，快快的努力吧！</p>
<p>說到惠山的泥塑，　前也全國聞名，家家小孩，沒有一個不把「大阿福」玩着的。自從新式的玩具出世，這「大阿福」便在打倒之列，這也怪不得他們，一來大阿福擁腫難看，二來又是一碰就碎。現在許多塑泥像的工人，也知加以改良，甚模特兒咧！甚麽劉關張三結義咧！都花樣翻新的塑出來。不過這些玩意，僅能得到一般低級人的趣味，上中階級的家庭，限少購買來陳列的。我以為再加改良一下，仿西洋塑石膏像的方法，把泥來塑成古今名人的半身像，或是英雄，或是美人，全用粉塗不加顏色，這也可以博到一般愛美的人歡迎咧！</p>
<p>以上二伴事，雖是小生產，倘使加以改良，加以宣傳，倒也是國貨界中一件奇兵咧！</p>

<p>創業維艱！而守業更艱！吾人觀於泰豐糖菜餅乾公司的猝然停業，與上海國貨公司的突吿淸理，從可徵騐，警訊傳來，以益利汽水著名的益利總公司，亦遽以停業聞，嗚呼！何國貨界不幸消息之多耶？</p>
<p>國貨冷飲品，益利的汽水，洵屬翹楚！記者家庭中深嗜之，年年夏季時，非此物不快！回憶當前年虞洽老旅滬五十年紀念公慶時，記者亦曾參與盛典！濟濟蹌蹌，名流畢集，時値祁暑，揮汗不止，而宴席上多備益利汽水，人人儘量暢飲，視為恩物！予從此視益利汽水為好友了！</p>

<p>— 李家祿</p>
<p>我們假使走上馬路，隨時便可看到商店裏的市招，寫着什麼「京廣洋貨」，「統辦東西洋各貨」，「歐美洋貨」，能看到幾家市招是「完全國貨」，「統辦國貨」呢？那簡直是寥若晨星了！</p>
<p>聽說今年是學生國貨年，不信，我們只要走進任何一個巍巍的學府裏去參觀一下，滿目都是筆挺的西裝少年，和穿一九三六式的高跟皮鞋的小姐，難我出幾位服用國貨的朋友，哦！這原來是提倡學生國貨年的結果嗎？</p>
<p>有人說：「在鄕村中提倡國貨」，照不佞看來，大可不必，因為他們的衣食住和用具，却是道地的老牌國貨呢？還是留一些精神，向都市裏醉心外貨的人們，多多的鼓吹一下，打幾針服用國貨的嗎啡針！</p>
<p>服用外貨，是各人的自由，而且法律上並沒有明文規定，如今只不過是「良心」問題吧了！所以說：「心理建設這四字，的確須　牠呢。其</p>

<p>— 其薿</p>
<p>八八節以後，國貨捲菸界的沈寂是打破了，而國貨捲菸展覽會更是以前所沒有的創舉，所以，不單楚捲菸圈子裏的人覺得興奮，就是這圈子以外的人，也受到一種新的刺戟，你看，前幾天大世界是多麽熱鬧，每一個　客的面孔上露着微笑去接受送給他的一包香烟。</p>
<p>穿過甬道，便是國貨門；不過這門僅有一個框子，實際上並沒有門可以開閉。門框子的左右有一付對聯是「維持會努力維持運動，中國人應吸中國香姻。」門框子正中掛着一盞國貨門燈籠，地上還有二盞國貨捲菸維持會的大撐燈。有人說這模樣正像衙門，不錯，國貨門是和衙門一樣莊嚴的。展覽會塲在共和廳前空塲上，香烟繚繞，燈光煇煌，一般穿著得齊齊整整的夜鶯，儘在這塲合對着遊客們媚笑。塲中有捲菸大模型一具，是一塊塊的鐵皮打成的，長八丈八尺，高入雲表。這樣長的捲菸，在大人國人民的目光中或許會嫌牠小，‘而對於我倆却是罕見，所以遊客是無不驚異的。這捲菸模型的四周圍便是各菸廠的陳列處，同時也各出售他們的各種出品。陳列得最美觀的是買司干亭，柱子上繞着紅藍兩色的布，櫃台是紅藍買司干　子的放大型的聯合，兩支大捲菸像兩尊高射砲似的正在噴出檀香氣味，左右兩個角子上還有兩個妙齡少女，著了挺漂亮的紅藍色的旗袍。這一定是他們廣吿上說的紅藍五郞，如果你以為她們的臉上塗有紅藍顏色，那是不成話說了。華菲烟公司陳列處立着一個矮人，他站在一張橙子上，耳垂大環，額覆紙花，胸部有一對又扁又小而略帶方形的乳房，這是紅綢子裹着棉花的假乳。這假菲洲人也能引起一般遊客的注意，但是我以為假使換一個漂亮女子，那未效力不更人嗎！</p>
<p>欄千外圍着不少人，一面看，一面評論得失，似乎很有勁兒。我兜了兩個圈子，覺得這一次展覺，的確費了若干人的心血，而國貨捲菸維持會的努力，也很能使人注意的。</p>

<p>「捉牢她，止住她，追渦頭去！快跑，童子們，快跑！」唐恩喊着，朝着她的去路拼命奔跑，因為她原是裴先生所竄愛的，所以假如她有個三長四短，唐恩怕得他自己是一切都完了。呀，他們不知狂奔了多少路，狂喊了幾百聲，狂喘了幾十次，才把她捉住！釣魚竿都棄在後面，兎披追奔的時候幾乎腿都跑脫了；各個童子都滿面通紅，上氣不接下氣，心裏又是着慌。最後他們在一個花圃裏找到了可憐的老黃花，她長途奔跑以後不勝疲乏，是到這裏來躱避的，唐恩偕了一個繩索絡上她的頭，將她牽回家去，後面跟着一羣很嚴肅的靑年人，因為這頭牛使人看了眞傷心，原來她跳牆的時候傷了肩背，因此她一蹺一拐，眼色裏看去像發火一般，她的重有光彩的毛已是滿沾着泥水了。</p>
<p>『這一次你要著把了，唐恩，」韜摩說道，他領着那個哮喘的驢子傍着那個受了虐待的老母牛一同回來。</p>
<p>『你也免不了，因為你是帮同的。」</p>
<p>『我們個個有份，除了小橋』解客又加上一句。</p>
<p>『嘸，他第一個提起這件事來的，』內達說道。</p>
<p>『我勸過你們不要這樣，」小橋喊道，他看到老黃花可憐的情形，幾乎要心碎了。</p>
<p>『老裴爾要容不得我了，我想。也罷，我不管，」唐恩咕嚕着，口頭雖硬，看去實在是憂煩呢。</p>
<p>『我們都要為你求情，我們一起，」小橋說道，別人也個個同意，只除了太腓，他却私心希望一切的罰都放在一個罪人的身上。唐恩祇說道，「不要為我費心」：但他從來忘記那個。一直是在擔心着的，雖然他遇到了引誘，又復將孩子們引入岐途了。</p>

<p>— （海鳶自東京寄）</p>
<p>我國北方考古學者李昭睦氏，近託其在日友人白堅氏至東京警視廳請求訪尋生母，據白氏言：李氏現年三十歲，為中國有名之考古學者，昭睦乃其假名，父名盛鐸，江西省九江縣人，三十二年前卽淸光緒二十四年任駐日公使，在任二年，後視察歐美，任比國公使，民國初年，歷任山西省民政長官參議院議長等職，現年七十八歲，休居滬上，度其殘年。當任駐日公使時，曾與一日婦同居，婦名橫溝菊，秋田縣人，法學博士高野岩三郞氏之兄高野房太郞之夫人，夫死於滬，遂歸李氏，生一子，卽昭睦是也。李氏轉任比利時公使，猶携菊同行，後忽以故仳離，菊單身歸日，而昭睦留父所，異邦一別，遂無見期。昭睦幼年，育於保媼，幾不知有母，及年漸長，其父吿以秘密，始知身所自出，乃動訪母之念，數年前嘗託友人至日探尋，而消息沉沉，悵　以返。近年昭睦住於天津日租界秋山街二〇一號，以考古學享盛名，而思母之念益切，適白氏亦以研究考古學渡日，遂復舉此相託也。</p>
<p>自白氏以此事委之警廳，警廳方面卽着手偵査，本月十日晨四時，忽有電話至赤阪山王旅館白氏寓中，通話者為一老嫗，名岡本小枝子，自言能知橫溝菊事，其人已於二十二年逝世。白氏聞之大驚，急招嫗至寓詳詢之，始知菊自比歸國，居芝區金杉町，因故夫弟高野岩二郞之資助，得以維持生活，至大正三年一月二十二日病逝，年三十四歲，死後仍由岩三郞為之治喪，葬　木鄉駒込吉祥寺，事隔多年，故知者已罕云。</p>
<p>白氏旣得此意外之報吿，遂乞嫗為導，自與其友結成素明畫伯赴吉祥寺探尋，果見寺　墓地一隅，有斷碑臥苔蘚中，細觀之，上有「高野家之墓」字樣，更檢閱寺中冊籍，亦確載橫溝菊之名，於是乃知嫗語非虛。頃白氏已致　李君，吿以一切，想李君得電，必悲喜集，不久當來日一參墓道，但不知彼海上頹翁，聞此消息，亦復一揮老淚，自悔其薄倖　也。</p>

<p>挈三五俊侶，放棹南湖，將與論文於烟雨　頭，意翛然也！船娘羅姓，為述湖上生活，又復惻然　自言：「有客，日可獲四五金，然所遭受，往往小可說。至若雨雪之辰，雖甘犧牲，亦無由也」世變至此，孰令之然？都扼腕無已。</p>
<p>游東塔，頹影中虛，風鈴不饗，絕似中年以後人，不堪與話榮枯。塔後，為漢朱翁子墓，明嘉靖間修，碑已中裂，　豐草蒙茸而已。考浙江通志：東塔寺卽朱買臣宅基。墓殆由好事者增飾之？竊謂買臣無大功德於當時，總其事跡，惟知夤緣富貴，悻悻以驕弱女子；例之穌季孑，品更為下。何幸一壟，留傳迄今。</p>
<p>午飲於湖中浮玉亭，萬柳　　，衆眼皆靑；念今夕中秋，得飛觴於此，何必玉宇瓊樓高處耶？樓為五代錢元璙所建，興修弗替，惜舊聯盡亡，致兩廡疥壁，令人不耐。酒闌，羅女泥游懺悔庵，從之，一艇西向，過濠股塔，而風雨驟至，短篷　膝，聽錚錚聲，亦可喜也。抵寺，猶淅瀝未止，有稚尼一，出欵客，時世裝束，似未可與語佛火生涯。庵飼秋蠶十許簞，方旺食，足亂密雨聲。興辭返橈，風益狂，流汗涔涔濕篙櫓，船家苦矣哉！向晚，達烟雨樓，電炬不明，覓燭以代，席間星火幽幽，古樸難狀。時湖烟益重，皓月終不可得而見矣！於是射覆猜謎以為樂，夜闌始已。是游也，同舟者，為糞翁，雪明，師誠，振聲，皆有詩預文藝競賽，發起者，為上海友聲旅行團。</p>

<p>則誠聽說他不要挾，可就怕他眞會要挾，於是向他笑道：好了，你放心罷，這事我總可以和你帮忙的。說着，站起來還握住他的手搖撼了兩下。介夫心裏，喜歡得只管跳，可是他的臉色，依然沉板得一點笑容都沒有。等則誠去了，他就老遠的向床上一倒，兩脚高高的舉着，向空中亂伸。忽聽傳李士廉在窗子外笑道：介弁兄還會武術呢。介夫跳起來，將手伸了兩伸，笑着向窗子外道：我有規矩的，必定要作十分鐘的柔軟體操，方才睡覺。李士廉道：那麼，你請安歇，明早再談罷。他說着自回房去，心裏可就想着，這樣看起來，在外面作事，這巴結人的工夫，實在不能缺少。張介夫拍藍專員的馬，那是自己親眼得見的，不也就硬拍上了嗎？那麼，自己從明天一早起，也去硬拍賈多才去。雖然彼此是多年老友，到了求人的時候，這可說不得了，只好從權。這樣轉了念頭，同時也就想到着手的辦法。次日起了一個早，特意跑到西安最著名的南苑門去，買了些雪花膏香水精手絹香皂之類，綑了一大包，就回旅館向賈多才送去。要說的話，也都想得妥貼。一到賈多才房門口時，自己先就是一怔，只見他面孔板得通紅，坐在臨門的一張椅子上，左手撑了頭，右手按了腿，似乎那氣是生得很大。剛要伸進門去的那一隻腿，不由得向後縮了轉來。（三二五）</p>

<p>約摸候了五六分鐘，張德才又上前去將蓋子揭起，讓太后自己或我們中的一人將那些菊花瓣酌量抓一把投下去，接着仍把爐蓋蓋上，再等候五分鐘，這一味特殊的食品便煮成了。所有在揭爐藍，投菊花的時候，太后總得不住口的指揮着：其實我們和張德都已熟練有素，伊眞不必多費心了！</p>
<p>魚片在鷄湯裏燙熟後的滋味，本來已是够鮮的了，再加上菊花所透出來的那般淸香，便分外覺得可口；而菊花的本身，原是沒甚滋味的，但經鷄湯和魚片一煊染，便也很鮮美了。太后吃得高興時，往往會空口吃下許多去。我們站在伊的旁邊飽聞那股香味，却很覺難受：偶然得太后慈悲，敎我們把伊吃剰的分食掉，便不由歡喜得了不得，誰也不肯再講什麽謙讓之禮，恨不得獨自吞了下去。</p>
<p>太后不僅愛把菊花用來作為佐餐妙品，同時更愛利用它們代替肥皂洗手；這裏所謂洗手，却並不是手上有了什麼污垢才洗，乃是隨時洗着玩玩的意思。伊老人家每從插在瓶內或供在盆裏的菊花上，摘下一朶將開未開的蓓蕾來，拆散了放在手掌裏，用力的磨擦，擦到那花葉齊變了渣才棄去，却不就洗手，只把手掌張開了讓它們自己吸乾；過了半饗，才用溫水洗去，可是那股菊花的香味便已留在手掌上了，皮膚也似乎染上了一重淡綠色。（四二五）</p>

<p>— 憶秋</p>
<p>阿嫵七歲那年，爸爸在當着科長，媽媽還健好如常，弟弟剛才出世，家裏頭充滿了快樂和幸福的氣氛。阿嫵因為長得十分秀麗而聰慧，爸爸媽媽都視同掌珠，分外疼愛，雖已七歲，奶媽還時刻跟隨在左右，寸步不離地侍候着。</p>
<p>現在阿嫵是十七歲了，正好像一朶吐艷的花兒，比從前更美麗得多了，可惜伊的命運啊！已陷入了最不幸的惡劣的階段。伊那患着第三期肺癆的爸爸終日笨第而短促地咳嗆着；伊的瘋癱了的媽媽，成天躺在籐場上呻吟着，還啊一個九歲的妹妹，十一歲的弟弟，時刻吵着鬧着，要吃要喝，啊！十年相隔，竟變成這樣一個慘痛而不幸的家庭，伊為了爸爸媽媽弟弟妹妹的醫藥與食糧，不得不負起全部的責任，經了幾番的考慮，伊終於犧牲了自己的一切，走上了一條易於掙錢的路途。</p>
<p>每當華燈初上，伊必開始伊的塗脂抹粉的工作，打扮得好像妓艷欲滴的花朶兒一般，送到西子湖邊的一個遊戲塲去任人採折。這樣，一犬，一天，的下去，漸漸地被同居的人家發覺了伊的秘密，都粉紛地議論着，開始鄙視伊了，當伊走過以後，都偏着嘴角，這樣咒咀着：「婊子！賤貨！把我們同門戶的鄰家的名譽都染汚了！」</p>
<p>阿嫵雖然也常常聽到這一類的駡聲，但從來不敢辯白半聲，只好低着頭任人漫駡，譏諷，滿眶辛酸之淚，只好待到更深人靜時，對着窗外的明月去盡情地揮灑而己。</p>
<p>後來，同居們都為了自己的名譽關係，遷出了這屋子，房東也知道了阿嫵的行業，下了逐客令。『限日遷讓！』於是四面的鄰居們都不約而同地譏諷着：『嗄：這麽表漂亮的小姐，原來是個婊了！」</p>
<p>一般人關於阿嫵的批評是：「每夜在出賣肉體，最下賤的女人！應富受　樣冷酷的待遇！」同時，伊那患着三期肺癆的爸爸和瘋癱了的媽媽是在想：「白大伺　父母弟妹，晚上還得去做夜工，絲毫沒有怨色，眞是一個難能可貴的孝女！」</p>

<h3 id="c187">阿Q的父親 <a href="#c187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>— 曹聚仁</p>
<p>關於阿Q的家世，阿Q正傳的作者魯迅先生語焉不詳。他只在序文上說：「有歷史癖與考據癖的胡適之先生的門人們，將來或者能够尋出許多新端緒來。」我今天並不是有什麼新的端緒尋出來；我生來並沒有那兩種癖，叉不是胡適之先生的門人，冒充博雅似乎可以不必的。然而要用這題目來講演者，還是從黃家花園那天的感想而來。阿Q兄之爲人，我們的確很熟悉：看見了趙太爺的客廳，更可以了解阿Q兄的生活。考古家看見原人的一顆牙齒，可以想像原人的生活狀况：我們熟知阿Q兄的性格，再推測他的老太爺是怎樣怎樣的一種人，也不算是空中樓閣罷。</p>
<p>魯迅先生說他的作品中的人物，「往往嘴在浙江，臉在北京，衣服在山西，是一個拚凑起來的脚色。」阿Q兄的嘴臉，蘇雪林先生曾經從阿Q正傳替他勾取出來：</p>
<p>第一是卑怯。阿Q最喜與人吵嘴打架，但必估量對手，口訥的他便駡，氣力小的他便打。「遇見强者不敢反抗，便以中庸這些話來以自慰；倘他有了權力，別人奈何他不得時，則凶殘橫恣，宛然如一暴君，做事並不中庸。</p>
<p>第二是精神勝利法。阿Q與人家打架吃虧時，心裹就想道：「我總算被兒子打了；現在世界　不像樣，兒子居然打起老子來了。」於是他也心滿意足儼如得勝地回去了</p>
<p>第三是善於投機。阿Q本來痛恨革命。等到辛亥革命大潮流震盪到未莊，阿Q看得眼熱，也做起革命黨來了。但假洋鬼子不許他革命時，他就想到衙門裏去吿假洋鬼子謀反，好使假洋鬼子滿門抄斬。</p>
<p>第四是誇大狂與自尊癖。阿Q所見極卑微的人物，而未莊人全不在他眼裏；甚至趙太爺的兒子進了學，阿Q在精神上也不表示尊崇，以爲我的兒子將比他闊得多。</p>
<p>—阿Q正傳及魯迅創作的藝術</p>
<p>所以阿Q兄的別號，常他在野時呌做「順民」得意了就雅稱「奴才」，到洋塲裏　來就呌做「樸歐」有時也尊稱為「買辦」。這樣于位精神勝利的大人物，的確是出於名門華族。他是北宋以來中華民族的兒子，我今天就講講這個。</p>
<p>清朝臣子對皇帝跪拜扶股，自稱奴才。（其實漢人做臣子的，不僅是奴才，還是奴才的奴才。）有一位據說是富有蠻子氣的學者——辜鴻銘，他曾用學理證明天生膝踝是爲着跪稱奴才的；但歷史吿訴我們，古代的臣子並不跪對，也不自稱奴才的。賈誼和漢文帝坐而論道，說到稱心愜意的地方，漢文帝還前席以聽。自從趙匡　做了皇帝以後，把坐而論道的老法子改變了；皇帝坐而聽政，臣子只能立而對答。直到朱元璋做了皇帝，又重新改定規章，臣子朝見，要跪在金變殿上對答。唐宋以前，昏暴的皇帝嚴刑峻法，殺戮忠良的事，歷史上本來很多。但為人君的總以士大夫的廉恥為重，決不肯侮辱人臣的人格的；（士可殺不可辱）明主禮賢下士，更不必說。從明朝起，開廷杖之風，一言不合，皇帝就呌左有的把朝臣拖下去打屁股，士大夫的顏面剝奪無餘了。明正德以後，廷杖至死，竟是家常便飯；因此讀書人不敢留一點剛正的骨氣，大家都到嚴嵩劉瑾魏忠賢門下去做乾兒義子。一個讀書人，如阮大鍼那樣大作家，都肯拜權勢的太監做乾老子，那對皇上自稱奴才，當然很是心安理得的了。淸初有一七十多歲的耄年大臣，跪了半天，神志便昏了；太監就大聲叱罵他，還準備用杖打他，一品當朝的大臣，也只好忍耐下去。由「坐論」進而「立對」，由「立對」「進而「跪陳」，叉由「跪陳「受廷杖」進而「自稱奴才」，這可驚的進步，乃是奴才學上一件大事。</p>
<p>以上所說的是奴才敎程中的特殊訓練；還有奴才的一般訓練，比特殊訓練更重要更普遍。科舉制度始自唐代，唐太宗看見新科秀才的得意忘形，他巳覺得「天下英雄盡入吾毅中」的痛快。北宋以後，科舉制度漸漸完密起來，程伊川就知道這制度的可怕；他說：「科舉之學，不患妨功，惟患奪志耳。果然，自從明代以四書文取士以後，士大夫的志氣一天一天被聰明的皇帝所侵蝕，大家都變成不講氣節不知廉恥的奴才。大家請看一看艾南英的應試文自序，他說：他旣不甘以白衣窮書生終老，只好到科塲裏去受磨折；應考的時候，受搜檢，受申斥，囚首垢面，夜露畫曝，暑喝風沙，簡直連囚犯都不如。這種不可吿自己妻孥的醜勾當，爲了要升官，大家都忍着氣來鑽。讀書人前半生在這個圈子裏打旋，弄得昏天黑地，早不知自已還要有什麼人格。後半生患得患失，在利祿塲中往來，更不講什麼道義了！明淸二代的讀青人，無論是講理學的，科舉出身的，或是詩酒風流的，都是訓練有素的奴才坯；讓康熙帝落一句「蠻子那有一個好人」的醜評！</p>
<p>對外族自稱順民，自南宋起。宋高宗對內算是皇帝，其實只能算是金國的臣子。他對金國稱臣表之：「臣構——旣蒙恩造，許備藩方，世世子孫，謹守臣節。——有渝此盟，明神是殛，墜命亡氏，踣其國家。』皇帝對外族稱臣，老百姓對外族稱順民，那還待說嗎？不過順民也有等第，在元代，凡遼金時的老脾順民呌做漢人，後來蒙古大兵略定江南時，再順的呌做南人。政治上重要職位以及重要權利，蒙古人色目人可以自己享受，漢人就低一級，經過蒙古人恩許的可以享受，南人就絕對沒有享受的機會。要說南人在元代百年中，有過什麼好處；只有元兵征日本被俘時，蒙古人漢人都要被殺，南人可保存性命，但叉不免爲海外的終身奴隸。元代那一百年的訓練，很有效果的，明代倭寇橫行沿海時，倭寇上岸，沿街挨戶都掛順民旗子；妻女玉帛，都讓倭人自由掠取。都是順民訓練的成績。順民旗在淸代的效用更大。英兵攻破寗波時，英法聯軍入北京時，甲午戰敗，東三省被佔時，到處都可以看見順民旗的飛揚。庚子拳亂那一回，津平一帶，各式各樣的順民旗都有；有自稱大英國順民的，有自稱大美國順民的，有自稱大俄國順民的，更可見六百年的順民訓練，成續着實不錯了。李鴻章和伊籐博文在馬關磋商條約，伊籐博文說：「我軍到了奉天，覺得漢人容易治得很」你看伊籐博文都贊美我們中國的順民了呢！在上有奴才訓練，在下有順民訓練；奴才」加「順民一，這就是我們阿Q兄的靈魂！朋友，我吿訴你：阿Q兄的老太翁，他的大名呌做一凍方的傳統精神」。</p>

<p>「是。」藍醫生理會似的應着，仍舊遺棄他的步子。</p>
<p>牧師又笑着像孩子似的笑。他把手記冊放進皮包理，得意的喉音又在急診間裹震盪了：</p>
<p>「陸長生！是，他的樣兒我還記得。長長的頭髮，長長的臉，兩頰是凹進的，鬍鬚很深，眼珠像死鰣魚一般，總是事歡向上仲。他也有中國人所特有的黃皮膚。」</p>
<p>牧師看一看藍醫生，想知道對方是不是佩服他的記憶力。他看他低着　像默認般一步步踱着，他就更喜悅地呌起來，　傲地表示自己是一個了不起的人物：</p>
<p>「對於一個自殺者的心理，我是可以揑在手掌上的。一個自殺　他一定是一個有力的漢子，至少在精神上。而且還是一個求生慾强過常人十倍的人。凡是這類人都會有一串驚人的歷史，因爲有個很重的動力把他們煆煉成這樣的，這正好像是樸燈的飛蛾，他們都缺少一個耶穌領導，於是他們是走錯了路了。要是從這一條路上冉給走回來的時候，他一定　成最能悔悟人間罪惡的人，因爲他比我們走得更近於「審判大日」了。而且這時候他才知道生命是可貴，於是他拿出飛蛾撲撞之力來懺悔，他便變成忠實的耶穌敎徒啦。這理論我巳經在陸長生身上試騐成功了。當我談到最後的審判，當我談到他生前的罪惡，他是多麼驚怕啊！當我談到耶穌復活，當我談到審判日敎徒是怎樣榮幸，他是多麼入迷啊！昨天他也院時候，我故意給他一塊錢，我想這樣做，他就永遠揑在我的掌提中了，喏，就在這裏。（揮一揮揑着手帕的拳頭。）他說明天來，我相信，他明天來，我要他做什麼，他就會做什麼的，甚至我呌他再去自殺他也許也會依命的。我更相信，他巳經是我的一個手指了。我有一種幻想，一個偉人的手指一定不是每隻手五個，否則揑成一個拳頭不是跟常人一樣的小了嗎？一塊錢，只有一塊錢，合美金僅僅兩角錢而巳！Dr藍，你要好好地救這兩角錢的生命呀，我們的手上應該長着這樣的手指的呀！Dr藍，我是爲了這件事才下下來的，我……</p>
<p>他看藍醫生並不理會他，一直走出去了，他把話停下來，狠狠地怒視他的後影。不過，一會兒，他也聽出來了，救護車巳經開回來啦。</p>
<p>牧師站到門口來，把擦鼻子的手帕冉移下一點，讓嘴巴也在掩蓋中。病人來了，小工推着搭牀，看護拿着紗布棉花之類的東西，藍醫生跟在後面。</p>
<p>牧師顫抖着，把手帕更捫得緊一點，他不敢近病人，只是遠遠地望着藍醫生的眼睛，因爲從這裏他可以瞧出病人的一切。</p>
<p>藍醫生把頭轉過來，正碰到牧師的眼睛，牧師驚了一下。</p>
<p>「牧師，我是說，藍醫生帶着嘲笑的樣子，「這個人是不中用了。他吃了來沙爾，連腸子都爛了吧，我想。不過，你倒來看一看，我們怎樣才可以把他治好呢？」</p>
<p>「不，不，Dr　，牧師緊捫着嘴搖頭，「你的話總不會錯，我不必來看。」</p>

<p>邊臉奔來的盡是做夜班的人</p>
<p>「阿金子，廠裏向那能？當眞明朝要减工阿是？」失神的眼珠子齊集在一個生在小手里上的中年女人的身上。</p>
<p>「阿有啥人同倷話白相阿是？倷去問問廠裏向周家里魷曉得格。伊拉全格能樣話。」鑲金牙齒的笑哂哂這樣答，指頭朝人一劃一劃地。</p>

<p>「一體拜做五日天生活，老底子大家話勿得了，現在做三日天生活還靠勿住，做廠阿有啥做頭？眞要餓煞哉！」</p>
<p>「眞眞窮人倒灶哉！窮人個灶哉！」</p>
<p>一陣亂七八糟的　聲，喊出了最大的痛楚的嘆息。那些失了業的守在家裏帶小人的男人，還眼巴巴指望着他的女人的生活過活咧！</p>

<p>「天誅窮人！」</p>
<p>「上半年水患，下半年叉……呃呃勿得了勿得了！」</p>

<p>— 龍在田</p>
<p>秋意巳深了，灰黯的　　　，不時晒下了微微的陣　　！，但據說，越是這們陰沉沉的天氣，潮就越大，終於還是跳上了街車，去到海寗。</p>
<p>縱說：巳凉天氣未寒時，但這一回旅行中沒準備着衣服，加上街車在淸泰門外寬闊的柏油路上疾馳，迎風而坐，凉生兩腿，實在頗有些　不耐，而愈益感覺着　瑟的秋意了。</p>
<p>這天的潮，據揭示要午後一點二十分才到，爲求暖意，爲便小坐，就在一個呌作中心茶室的院子裏砌了一壺茶。那是想象不到的衰敗零落，低低的房屋裏，在這無光的日色下，烏黑得少不的要點上燈來。身在其間，祇感覺着一種說不出的　壓！然而它還是那裏附近最像樣的茶　，有綁了木或竹的變形的籐椅，有印滿了指紋的玻璃杯……確乎是那裹「中心」的了。</p>
<p>不免在附近溜達一週，泮池上面，矗立着古色盎然的石坊；兩邊寄居的盡是苦力；象一樣的母猪，儀態有方地蹣跚着：白鵝和鷄，散兵綫似地分跑着；柵門裏幾口壽材排立着……使我浮起了一個奇異的感想，不敢深入了。</p>
<p>出城去的人逐漸冬起來了，也有文質彬彬地捻着望遠鏡的，我便也跟着去了。</p>
<p>在石壩上的翻客，居然也有五六百，這裏也有蛇樣的女人，伴着木刻式的洋服靑年，但據說十八這天全壩上擠滿了密集的人的，今天才眞是小巫之尤了。</p>
<p>遠處：在隱　的幾　靑山下，有一條白綫，逐漸在眼膜上放大起來，戰鼓一樣的鳴聲，擂着，使每一個人的脈搏都加速起來了。就在這時候，站在我旁邊的土著，吿訴了我一個趣味的傳說：</p>
<p>『這裏的潮水，本來不響的。一次錢塘皇挑着一担鹽，在赭山走來，給潮水打上來，把鹽打翻了。錢塘皇就勃然大怒，駡它，「爲什麼不關照我一聲」？從此以後，潮水一過赭山就響起來了。同時水也鹽了，赭山以外，却還是淡水。那是錢塘皇一担鹽的緣故。」</p>
<p>也許他還有話說下去吧，我却無心聽了。小普渡前面的第一條船桅上下波動了，五六尺高的雪白浪花，就一整齊地橫掃過來！那一種奔騰澎湃的壯觀，除開內心的領略而外，實非現存的文字所可能形容於萬一的。看客的每一個頭，也跟着潮的前進而動亂起來，先前祇看見船桅不見船身的許多沙船，全却驀然地昇起與岸齊了</p>
<p>但也就在這時候，我看見了一幕抹不去的悲劇！</p>
<p>這些沙船是專候潮汛，從此岸運到彼岸來裝卸貨物的，潮落了，從那邊不論有貨無貨開回來；潮漲了，就從此間開過去，終年如此。每運米一袋，可得運費四分五；活羊一頭，得運費五分……惟其是他們需要候潮的，所以剛是潮浪一過，岸上的工人們就急速地搶着把預定搬運的貨物——米，棉花，豆餅，羊……緊張地甩下船去。這情景，會使我們憧憬到十八世紀時代的海盜生活；而他們苦力們的每一個臉，也足以使我們領悟到佛堂裏的羅漢，不是虛幻的塑像，是他們的模型。他們那劇急用力以後的屬背與路膊上的肌肉，不住地痙　地抽縮着，胸膛上的黑毛，跟着心臟的急促呼吸，張合着……不到幾分鐘，全船巳裝得滿滿的，接着就拉起巨幅的蓬來了。</p>
<p>同時，却驀地出現了一羣一手挽包，一手提籃，或一條蓆子……東西的老的，少的，壯的男女，老太太尤多，都　命地栗碌着跳上船去，他們就都在蓬的陰影下的米袋着　起來。我先前竟爲他們是沙船上工人們的眷屬，但跟一個大槪是船主的商人間談的結果，才知道都是搭客，要化兩毛一名，載到南沙的。而這時，另有一個壯丁，在石階上葡伏下去，——囚爲不見正式的石階，祇是參差的疊石，勉强可以踏脚而巳——預備跳上這巳離岸的沙船，但是，眞够慘呢！一個浪的洶湧，把船又擠攏來，而他——這位壯丁——就做了船與石岸之間的一大肉墊！當時，他那沒命的呌喊，祇裂帛樣一嘯！把每一個觀潮後滿意的心靈，都震得粉碎了吧。於是觀潮的，都無意識地圍了上去。祇看見他褲子上添了一大堆血，全身在石岸捧命的挽，兩眼釘着鼻子，幽靈似地怕人！女人們散開去了，我也記不得這時浮起什麼感覺，祇怔視着。但船主一樣的商人，却還在破口大駡；「爲什麼要到此地來作死！潮不讓情的，你站在石岸什麼……」。一面掏出了兩個「大」鍋子，吩咐買白葫椒去！</p>
<p>沒有結論的看客散去了，我也麻木地拖着疲憊的腿跟着去了，祇是不安定的心　上，叉加上了一點慘酷的黑影！</p>
<p>眞的，誰會料想到，那末活生生的一條漢子，魷在這一　那會了結他的生命的呢？（完）</p>

<h3 id="c192">爲神作伐奇聞 <a href="#c192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>— 行安</p>
<p>昨據報載福州通訊：近省政府忽令公安局，將城內通天境七星奶廟神像毀除，廟門封閉，綠所謂七星奶者，相傳爲能庇佑兒童之女神，素爲一般低級社會所崇奉，於是遂有人假藉神權爲漁利之藪，凡拜七星奶爲寄男女者，每年神誕，每名須繳香金一元，計寄名男女八千餘名，可得八千餘元，由該廟董事林某等，飽諸私囊，嗣因社會上有人認爲此輩藉神歛財，應加取締，乃林某等今年竟奇想天開，向社會宣稱，謂七星奶仰慕明代名將戚繼光忠貞烈武，願委身下嫁，並商得戚公裔孫同意，將戚公祠中木偶，移駐通天境，七星奶則遷居經殿，其意在提高七星奶之身份，俾得繼續藉神詐財，一時社會譁然，僉謂褻凟可公人格事膛省當局所聞，遂於前日由縣局警察，將境內大小神像二百餘尊,悉數毀壞，拋入河中云。</p>
<p>這眞是一伴亘古未有的奇聞。通天境七尾奶廟董事林某等，爲要籍神歛財，竟爾異想天開，强將明代名將戚繼光入贅一位來歷不詳的七星奶。這不但荒謬絕倫，而且也極突梯滑稽。本來，迷信勢力普遍於我國民間，一般靠神吃飯的神棍，只要有機可乘，有利可圖，無論什麼巧妙花樣都幹得出。神誕要熱鬧一番是不必說的，地方不靜須舉行迎神賽會，以鎭壓邪鬼。有時廟里香爐偶然發火，這是王爺想出外繞境。在這種種塲會，居民之自稱爲善男信女者，大家就得捐助一點錢，以表其虔誠之心。於是神棍們奔走之勞，就有代價了。七星奶廟林某等諸董事，一年有八千餘元可收入，一受取締，豈不白白斷送一筆大欵子。怪不得他們要將戚公的偶像，移駐通天境，藉提高七星奶的身份，以繼續其詐財的行爲。可笑的還是這輩拜七星奶的八千餘名的無知寄名男女。沒有他們的愚笨舉動，林某等神棍也便無從施其技倆了。現在省政府將境內大小神像二百餘尊，全部毀除，並封閉其廟門，這確是一樁大快人心的事，於破除迷信，極有效力。惟聞閩當局施政方針，向主在不妨碍善良風俗之下，不妨暫從地方習慣，因此迎神賽會，及神　舖張，甚至扶乩跳神，均在所不禁。這種措施。雖自有其不得己之處，然七星奶廟這次所玩的把戲，未始不是當局過於縱容迷信所致。故省政府今後對於地方上不良風俗，實有加以相當注意的必要。</p>
<h3 id="c193">急水灘頭 <a href="#c193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>— 鳴</p>
<p>我的故鄕是山島出名的省分，我的家鄉，就在柳江沿岸的一個小市鎭。這條柳江就沿着山脈曲折地往下流，雖沒有四川巫峽的巖峻，但兩岸的高山，和猙獰奇突的石筍，象瀑布一般湍急的江流，過些都够使舟子們驚心動魄了。</p>
<p>在一個暮春落花的日子，我從那古舊破落的家庭里逃了出來，乘着在柳江上航行的民船，到柳江上游去找尋我那渺茫不可知的前途。</p>
<p>我懷着一種恐怖和好奇的心情，象一個逃亡者一般蜷伏在那六七尺寬，一丈來長的船艙里，艙板到艙頂的船蓬只兩三尺高，不能抬起頭來。船艙一面是載着糧食雜貨和未曾硝過的牛皮，那牛皮發着經石灰醃過和太陽晒過所蒸發出的惡臭，把我的腦壳熏得發漲。</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>在一陣鑼聲敲過之後，船魷移動開行了，船是沿江而上，逆水行舟；開始是用漿搖船，接着船未就跑到江岸上去拉纜了。在這暮春的太陽光輝的映照下，江水閃着金色灧灧的波光，兩岸的高山，給春的噓息都變成靑翠了，山林現着爲鬱蒼綠的顏色，在這些高山的樹叢棘草中，蕩着鷓鴣和斑鳩的啼叫，給人帶來一種春的威傷和憂鬱的旋律。溫暖駘蕩的使人陶醉和能煽熾悵觸別情離緒的春風，緩緩地吹來，夾着一些野花的香味和船夫們拉纜時哼出那被生活壓榨所發出深沉悽壯的歌聲，在我這個初出門的旅人胸中織成一種悵惘悲喜的感情。</p>
<p>船走得很慢，因爲水急和灘多，上一個灘要經過成個鐘頭，上灘之後，船夫們就要用一次飯，象機器要加煤一般充實他們的胃腸。一直到黃昏時分才走到一半的路程，在我們的前面正慢慢地展開着黑夜，和一個亂石縱橫激流飛濺的龍門灘。</p>
<p>天色是漸漸地陰暗了，船夫們的臉上也同時陰暗起來。纜也收回了，船夫們都回到船上來，在他們那些陰暗的面孔上現出堅决嚴肅决鬥的態度。接着他們十來個人都拿起竹篙來，一篙一篙地撑着船兒向前進。船就慢慢地跟龍門灘接近；在這灘的兩岸是很高的山，使得灘頭更顯得陰暗，船象駛進深谷中。灘床上崛起的嶙的石筍，和激流衝擊着礁石濺起的怒濤和飛沫，更現出這自然界江河的兇險。</p>
<p>我走出艙口去，是開始上灘的時候了。船夫們開始用竹篙頂着灘底，把竹篙抵在肩上，拼命地把全身的精力都在竹篙上從船頭向洋橋一級一級爬向船尾去，嘴里發出「咦呀咦呀」的叫聲，象給人鞭打一般地慘叫，船就一刻鐘走一寸地向別進。進到灘上最險要的龍門的時候，河身只有兩丈來寬，兩而盡是石筍和礁石，象大烏龜一般聳着背。在進龍門時船夫們的叫聲更加慘厲，激流的怒浪排山倒海般地冲着船往下推，船夫們魷拼命地用竹篙抵着礁石撑船往前進，構成一幅人類和自然搏鬥的偉雄畫圖。可是船的前進是非常的慢，那塊礁石始終在我們的船邊。船夫在叫着，掙扎着，抵抗這激流的威力。這時在左邊最前的一個船夫，他那抵在礁石的竹篙突地　了一下，竹　就　空地　去了沐、跟着船夫也失去了抵抗靠的東西，他震了一下就「磅」地一聲撲到江里去，剛巧他的頭撞在礁石上，頭壳開花了，一聲不響地沉下水去，一股血流隨着飛沫冒起來。這時船夫們都狂叫起來。有一兩個就把抵着的竹篙抽起來，伸到那被難者的身旁去，接着船失去抵抗的力就很猛烈地震了一下，船老板就在船尾高叫起來</p>
<p>「狗入的，不要鬆手，把竹篙抵緊，鬆手就完了！」</p>
<p>船夫們也知道一鬆，船就會被激流衝去和礁石接吻？這樣船就給礁石擊碎，船就完了。如是船夫們慘叫着用肩膊抵着竹篙，在沒有流眼淚的緊張和自然的壓力下，睜着眼看自己的夥伴頭破血流地隨着怒濤飄去了。</p>
<p>經過兩小時的掙扎，船才爬上龍門灘，黑暗巳經把這灘頭封鎖了。船夫們的臉陰沉地流着悲哀的眼淚，望着那兇險的灘頭，永遠看不到他們的同伴了。只有怒濤擊着礁石發出象擂戰鼓一樣的聲音，這聲音彷彿夾着那不幸者的慘叫和悽咽。從那兩岸高山的黑暗的林叢和棘草的深谷里，還斷續地飄散着斑鳩和鷓鴣憂鬱的啼叫。這就是我踏主人路上第一次看生活悲慘的圖畫。</p>
<h3 id="c194">蛆 <a href="#c194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>— 楊仲碩</p>
<p>我住的地方極爲幽靜，有垂楊，有綠，更有一灣澄澈的泉水。</p>
<p>離我住處不遠，是一間年代頗爲久遠的古寺，那洪亮的晚鐘聲音曾經驚醒我幾年來的夢。自己能够掙脫現實的覊絆，樂天安命，恬淡自如的過着這種悠閒的歲月，歸根，還是被那鐘聲迷着了。</p>
<p>這寺，因爲年久失修巳呈傾圯之象，那頹垣，那敗瓦，那斑爛的牆壁，在在都表示牠衰老得已被人們所遺忘。</p>
<p>但是，那古色斑爛却迷惑了我，每　黃昏時分，在木魚鐘鼓聲中，我悄悄走進這寺。</p>
<p>因爲每天必到的原故，那些和尙都認得我了。見面時大都謙恭有禮，十分和靄。</p>
<p>住持是一個四十上下的中年人，面孔在飽滿中略帶淸癯，從行動舉止看來不失書生本色，一見我來便滿臉笑容的問我一天做些甚麼事。</p>
<p>「看看書習習字，別無其他，」每次都以這句說話答他。却不曾看見他有半點不耐煩的表情，有時還瞇瞇的笑着，雖然我的答語是那末刻版從沒改變過。</p>
<p>初去時，大家都有些拘謹，後來漸漸熟了，我們談話間就無一點虛飾。</p>
<p>有一次我又去找他，在照例問我做些甚麼之後，他開始吿訴我他過去的歷史，他說他從前曾做過帶兵官，做過稅收處長，做過政治漩渦里的活動人物，這使我很覺詫異。一個在酒肉徵逐環境中生活的人怎麼會一旦放下屠刀，擺脫繁華的現實來度着這種妻凉的歲月？這不能不算是奇跡。然而這奇跡還不算挺奇，奇的是：旣做了和尙便該六根淸凈，專心專意皈依我佛才是可是，他又吿訴我他雖做了和尙，仍然飲酒食肉，碰着有興致的時候，還會邀三四知己到附近的窰子去打打茶圍呢。</p>
<p>這番說話假如被那些衛道之士聽見了眞不知臭駡到如何程度，可是，我覺得他這種坦白直率的自供十分可愛。</p>
<p>我曾經問過他爲茶麼要做和尙。他毫不遲疑，而且很巧妙的說，「如果一個人在聲色犬馬的環境中埋沒了一生　糞堆里的蛆有何分別？我之所以忍心撇下家庭妻子，把富貴名利視之如浮雲的原因，就是不甘願做蛆　」</p>
<p>我被他的議論感動着了，我同情他，欽佩他，對他卓絕的見解尤深折服。幾乎便想立刻拋棄了現在的生活，遁跡到那高深莫測的，神秘性的空門里去。</p>
<p>可是，待我表示了自己的願望之後，他又反對說「你到底還年靑，　沒有嘗透了那糞堆的臭味，而且這時代也好像不需要消極的生活方式，國家的支離破碎仗仰你們年靑人去縫補，佛敎所謂輸迴涅槃的說法不過是勸善警世的箴言。你們靑年人旣沒有犯過欺世盜國的罪惡，也沒有做過違背良心的勾當，叉何必多此一舉？以有爲之年而趨消極，我個人固然不能贊同，魷是你的家庭，你的戚友也不容許呀！」</p>
<p>最近我已好幾天沒有到那古寺里去了，獨個兒百無聊賴的時候就會把思想用在那些虛渺的幻象上面。「做糞蛆呢，還是超脫自己？」這問題更時常在我的腦海中盤旋。</p>
<p>一個突如其來的消息使我一怔，昨天黃昏時分我重新在木魚鐘鼓聲中走進了古寺。可是那住持不見了。先前我還以爲他和三四知己逛窰子去了，後來據另外一個和尙吿訴我，他——住持已應某省的委任做縣官去了。聽了那和尙的話我抿着嘴苦笑。</p>
<p>從這時候起，我的「成見」便開始發生動搖，我覺悟了，這人世間何處不是糞堆！</p>
<p>那住持到底不能逃避現實仍須向糞堆里攢！可憐仍是糞堆里的蛆！</p>
<h3 id="c195">弄猴者 <a href="#c195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>— 巖</p>
<p>對街的商店搬毀之後，在那一片瓦礫乏塲上半年多沒有重建房屋。傳言是這方兩畝多地基，發現了兩　執　契的主人，以致涉訟未决；另一說地主沒有資本重建，於是這一幕曠地上就成了雜要之塲。</p>
<p>我的臥室斜對着這方曠地，地上旣沒有重建房屋，視綫雖然斜一點，還是能一覽無餘的。從公司中歸來，正是夕陽西斜的時候，亦正是曠塲上最熱鬧的時候。有西洋鏡，賣拳頭，弄猴者，許多小販於是亦羣集於此，儼然一個小小的市塲了。那些放學歸家的小學生和下層階級的婦女作爲他們的娛樂塲所了，看來營業很是鼎盛。如果照一說地立沒有資本重建房屋，就這樣分劃地段收幾個買路錢，半年來的成績也很可觀的。</p>
<p>我佔着窗口的便宜，無聊時候，也憑着窗檑瞧瞧熱鬧。因爲弄猴者的塲地距離我視綫最近，而且他的圈子上觀衆特別擁擠，自己就會莫明其妙跟那些觀衆一樣瞧着那猴子的玩意兒而不倦。有時歸家稍遲，他們已散了塲，心中覺得有些念念不忘的樣子。</p>
<p>人類是由人猿進化的，那末這些猴子會玩一點小把戲是無足希奇的。自家更不是孩子時代的心境了，瞧着那猴子的跳躍而引爲歡樂，又是每天老是幾套把戲。我所念念不忘的是那個弄猴者：他的兩鬢已斑，至少是五十開外的人了。他祇是一個人，沒有帮手，那頭猴子恐怕就是他惟一的伴侶了。他獨自打鑼，獨自招呼觀衆，獨自唱着不成腔的調子，獨自指使猴子做戲。他是駝背的，在那樣煩重的工作下，往往喘着氣，流着汗，還竭力使自家的腦袋注視着觀衆，恐怕他們感到不喜歡而走散了。每天他收兩次錢，向每個觀衆打躬作揖，顯　他的身材更是矮小了。給　　　　　少，兩次的收集，是滿滿的一　　　　想是够他同他的惟一的伴侶猴子一天的食宿了。</p>
<p>但是這幾天來，曠塲上的雜要塲子少了幾個，那弄猴的老者也同時不見了。我曾問過一個每天在那曠塲玩要的孩子，孩子回答我不知道。今天却在我們的弄里遇見這一對相依爲命的伴侶了。他還是穿着那襲百頁的破衣，獨自打着鑼，觀衆自然不及塲上時的那末多了。我踏進弄的時候，他正捧着鑼要錢，我隨手丟了幾個給他，他習慣地打躬作揖了，像那猴子做戲一樣機械，裝着一個難看的笑容，一疊連聲地稱謝，是山東口音。</p>
<p>收拾了錢，他作了個總揖，牽着猴子走路了。我本來想問他幾句話的，看着他那樣吃力地走路樣子，我不敢啟口了。但是弄內巳有人先問過他這幾天不到塲上的原因，是這條馬路上有權力者向他要買路錢，他因爲付不起這一筆意外的出欵被他們驅逐了。</p>

<h3 id="e1">After the Breach of the Liutang River, Guanyun Implemented Emergency Prevention and Control; 60,000 Laborers Worked Day and Night to Reinforce the Embankment on the Yan River; the Entire County Mobilized, and 2,000 Tax Police Were Also Assigned to Participate <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>(Xuzhou) Haixun reports that after the Liutang River breached its banks in Muyang, Guanyun directly bore the brunt downstream. County Magistrate Xu XieKui convened an emergency prevention and control meeting with Engineer Shen from the Huai River Guidance Department. 60,000 laborers were conscripted to reinforce the east and west embankments of the Yan River day and night. Construction commenced on the 23rd and was required to be completed within five days. The tax police corps and the Lianghuai smuggling suppression team also assigned 2,000 men to participate. The entire county's officials, civilians, military, and police were mobilized to rush to the rescue to avoid the expansion of the disaster area. However, the situation is extremely critical. (25th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) Guanyun was greatly affected by the Liutang River breach and is in a state of tension. County Magistrate Xu led laborers to retreat and defend the various embankments along the Yan River within the county to prevent the expansion of the disaster area. Another 60,000 laborers are now being conscripted, and military, police, and all government agencies throughout the county are being uniformly mobilized to supervise. (25th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Economic Commission, to understand the ice conditions of the Liutang River and the Guan River, has specially dispatched Water Conservancy Department Technician Yang Baopu to conduct an inspection. (25th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>The Various Rivers of Muyi Overflow Simultaneously</p>
<p>(Qingjiangpu) This time, the Yellow River disaster spread from Lu to Xu and then divided into four routes to discharge. One route flowed from Luoma Lake through the Da Shaqi River directly into Mucheng. Another route branched off from the central canal into the Zongliutang River, encircling southern and eastern Mu. Another route branched off from the downstream of the central canal into the Huaiyin Yan River, entering Guan via Lian, and joining the Liutang River. All of the above followed the sea route. As a result, the various rivers of Muyi, Wanggong, Chaimi, Shangxin, Qianhoumu River, and Dongguan Wuzhang, Longgou, Qiangwei, Shaoxiang all overflowed simultaneously. Therefore, currently, all males over the age of fifteen in Magou, Tanggou, Guantai, Dayiyangyu, Qianwei, Yizhuang, and other places have been conscripted to defensive positions to protect the area. One route goes from the central canal to Yangjiazhuang, west into Hong Lake, and east towards Liyun to enter the Yangtze River. However, there has been no danger reported along this route from Suqian and below. However, Siyang and Zhongxing are alarmed several times each night, as if the end of the world is near. Furthermore, the river camp officials and runners of Huai'an, Huaian, GaoBao, and other counties are staying in shacks and patrolling throughout the night, not daring to relax in the slightest. Whether there will be danger in the future is still uncertain. (25th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Relief Funds from Various Counties are Remitted in Batches</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) Shao Hanyuan stated that of the various counties in northern Jiangsu, Pi County was the most severely affected. He has now submitted a request to accompany Yu Shufang to inspect Pi County to investigate the disaster situation and relief matters. Shao has received a telegram from the province stating that the Disaster Relief Headquarters has allocated relief funds: 61,100 yuan to Pi County, 39,900 yuan to Tong County, 26,000 yuan to Pei County, and 13,000 yuan to Feng County. These funds will be remitted in batches. The first batch has already been handed over to the Agricultural Bank for remittance. Shao has instructed the various counties to prepare to receive and distribute the funds. The Relief Association believes that Tong County has undertaken more embankment construction in the north and has suffered particularly heavy losses of manpower and proposes to increase relief funds to provide universal assistance. (25th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) The Shanghai Chinese and Foreign Charity Association dispatched Lu Bohong to pass through Xuzhou to Ru to provide disaster relief. Lu returned to Xuzhou last night. After disembarking, he inquired about the disaster situation from the political authorities and returned south the same night to raise funds for relief. (25th Dispatch)</p>
<p>The Magistrate of Shuyang County Resigned Taking Responsibility</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) Haixun reports that after the Liutang River breached its banks in Muyang, the disaster was extremely severe. County Magistrate Deng Xianghai telegraphed the province to resign, taking responsibility. He stated that the Eastern Water Dam upstream was the main cause of the breach. Last year, when dredging the river, Guanyun was assigned very little earthwork below Geji, and the shallowness of the river was also a cause of the breach. He believed that he had no experience in water management and could only blame himself and retire, etc., expressing much resentment. In the future, if the waterway is not dredged and the Liutang River remains the only outlet for the Yellow River, the disasters in the Hai area will only increase. (25th Dispatch)</p>
<p>The Area Flooded in Pi County Has Shrunk</p>
<p>(Qingjiangpu) According to boat passengers from Pi County, due to the successive breaches of the Su and Mu embankments downstream, drainage was greatly facilitated, and the flooded area in the county's four townships is shrinking daily. Disaster victims are mostly considering post-disaster recovery issues. (25th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Huaiyin is Generally Collecting Medicines to Send to Pi</p>
<p>(Qingjiangpu) The musty smell of the water in the canal has not yet dissipated. The people in the disaster area are suffering from hunger, cold, and epidemics. The Huaiyin Flood Prevention Association, based on the resolutions of the second standing committee meeting, is generally collecting Chinese and Western medicines to send to Pi for relief. (25th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Gales and Yellow River Waters in Xuzhou Rise Slightly</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) Gales occurred in the Xuzhou area on the 24th evening and subsided on the morning of the 25th. According to telegrams from the four counties of Tong, Pei, Pi, and Feng, gales raged throughout the night, and the Yellow River waters rose slightly. Fortunately, the embankments in various places had been raised and thickened in advance, and there was no danger. (25th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Jinan) Han telegraphed Jiang, reporting on the progress of preparing for the closing of the breach, and stated that he had firmly declined the appointment but had not been allowed to refuse, and was again ordered to comply. He has ordered the Breach Closing Committee to submit the estimated budget for the breach closing plan to the committee for approval by the 20th of next month, and has ordered the engineering department to immediately implement the project of excavating the river in the east and west dams, etc. Once there is an opportunity to close the breach, the official closing project can be carried out. He has also ordered the Minsheng Bank to set up an office at the construction site. (25th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Jinan) Eight trains of materials for closing the breach have arrived, but many locomotives are unusable. The Breach Closing Engineering Department has been established. (25th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Jinan) The Breach Closing Committee previously planned to borrow funds from the Geng Indemnity. The Economic Commission telegraphed to inquire about the amount and repayment procedures and ordered the submission of the proposed fund utilization plan. (25th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Jinan) Han Fuqu telegraphed Chairman Jiang on the 25th, reporting on the progress of closing the breach, briefly stating that the transportation of materials has been difficult and that he has not dared to delay in the slightest. Since the beginning of this year, one month has passed, and a large amount of materials has been prepared. If construction funds are available, the breach can be closed before the ice melts this year. (25th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The Central Political Conference held its 476th meeting at 8:00 AM on the 25th. Over thirty people attended, including Wang Zhaoming, Ye Chuqiang, Sun Ke, Ju Zheng, Lin Sen, Kong Xiangxi, He Yingqin, Zhu Jiahao, Chen Gongbo, and Hong Ludong. Wang Zhaoming chaired the meeting. The following resolutions were passed: (1) The government ratified the request of Liu Zhi, Chairman of the Henan Provincial Government, to resign from his concurrent post as Director of the Civil Affairs Department of the province and appointed Fang Ce as a member of the Henan Provincial Government and Director of the Civil Affairs Department. (2) It was resolved that local civil servants would donate their salaries to aid disaster relief, following the same procedures as the central government civil servants' salary donation for disaster relief.

<h3 id="e4">Important Discussions Between Chinese and Japanese Personnel in Tianjin Yesterday <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>(Tianjin) At 9:00 AM on the 25th, important discussions were held at the reception hall of the Beining Railway Bureau on Fei Road in the Tianjin French Concession. The Chinese side was represented by Yin Tong, Wang Ruoxi, Director of the Tianjin Telegraph Bureau, and Yin Rugeng. The Japanese side was represented by Takeshita, Chief of the Shanhaiguan Special Service Organ. Takeshita stated that bandits in the Changcheng area within the war zone have been largely suppressed. He had originally intended to visit the counties in the war zone but had already visited Tong County once and knew the general situation. Therefore, he does not intend to go again in the near future. (25th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Takeshita stated that the bandit atmosphere at Jiaoshan Temple near Shanhaiguan has been quelled and there is no need for the security team to suppress it. (25th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Yin Rugeng went to Tianjin yesterday to attend the bandit suppression meeting in the war zone. After the meeting, he returned to Ping today afternoon to report to Shang Zhen. Wang Xinggong, Magistrate of Jixian, came to Ping from Ji last night to report on county affairs to Yin Rugeng. Wang stated that bandits in Jixian have withdrawn from the Changcheng area north of the Youhuangya Pass and Jiangjun Pass. Japanese troops are searching and suppressing them. The situation in Jixian is as peaceful as ever. The work of prohibiting drugs and gambling is progressing smoothly. A vagrant reception center has now been established. Anyone who is idle or has bad habits, once captured, will be sent to the center for reception and reformation. (25th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) On the 16th of this month, the Japanese garrison in North China dispatched more than 100 troops to various Japanese garrison locations in the war zone, such as Jianchangying, to assist the war zone security team in suppressing bandit gangs such as Yang Erzhang and Haijiao. There are currently no traces of bandits in the various counties of the war zone and near the Great Wall. Therefore, the Japanese troops have gradually returned to their original defenses.

<p>(Geneva) The report of the Fifth Committee, approved today and intended to be submitted to the League of Nations General Assembly, expresses admiration for the Chinese government's determination to eliminate opium. It states that the committee has paid close attention to the information provided by the Chinese delegation regarding the Chinese government's efforts to prohibit secret manufacturing, illegal trade, and abuse of narcotics, as well as opium smoking. The Chinese delegate had stated that the governments of some countries have not yet notified the Advisory Committee of their attitude toward the Advisory Committee's and its eighteenth meeting's passed recommendations regarding the expulsion and other punishment of private drug traffickers. The Fifth Committee agrees with the Chinese delegate and hopes that the governments of the relevant countries will submit satisfactory replies as soon as possible. The report also states that as a result of publicity, opium smoking among young people in China, Vietnam, Malaya, and the Dutch East Indies seems to have been greatly reduced.

The Yulin is currently undergoing repairs due to engine damage. Takeshita stated that the incident of the Qinhuangdao Customs patrol boat being disarmed, according to a report from the commander of the Kwantung Army military police in the local area, was based on the war zone agreement, which states that except for the security team, which is allowed to be armed, no one else is allowed to carry weapons. Since the Qinhuangdao Customs patrol boat was armed, it violated the treaty. Therefore, they were disarmed. It is now understood that there has been no major misunderstanding. (25th Dispatch)</p>

<p>A Commentary on the Trading Methods of Industrial Securities – Pan</p>
<p>The Industry and Commerce Rehabilitation Committee recently formed a subcommittee to discuss the issue of "chips" (籌碼, could refer to stocks or other securities). It drafted a statement outlining the maladies of China's current financial system, advocating for the use of bills of exchange in the short-term capital market to replace the account-based system, and for the development of the circulation of industrial securities in the long-term capital market. Since this spring, various industries have been actively promoting commercial acceptance bills, and banks and industries are also planning to introduce bank acceptance bills. The first proposal is expected to be implemented soon. As for the second issue, it is reported that the committee is in contact with the Chinese Stock Exchange to start trading company stocks and bonds. However, in our opinion, this is unlikely to yield effective results in the shortest term.</p>
<p>The Chinese Stock Exchange has attempted to start trading company stocks and bonds several times before, but each time it was suspended within a few days. This is because the market is dominated by government bonds and treasury bills. Customer interest is concentrated on these. Furthermore, investment in government bonds and treasury bills has been promoted by the government for more than twenty years, and the public has a considerable understanding of them. Retail investors are also numerous. In contrast, although there have been occasional over-the-counter transactions of stocks in the past, investment interest has been limited to certain individuals. It has not been as widespread as government bonds and treasury bills. This is because company businesses are different from each other, and even within the same enterprise, there are differences in management skills. For stock investors, unless they have a deep relationship and special research, it is not easy to choose the right targets. Now that the Industry and Commerce Rehabilitation Committee is seeking to promote the circulation of industrial securities and to improve the sound development of the securities market, its intentions are certainly profound. However, we believe that the current opening of trading should first have sufficient preparation and meticulous technical design. For example, the stock list must be inclusive and strive for breadth. Securities should also be graded to provide a reference for investors. A research institution should also be established to facilitate consultation for brokers. The trading market should also be independent in principle. If a spot securities market can be established and the number of spot brokers increased, the results can be expected. If the policy of the past is followed and it is attached to the futures market, the previous failures should be taken as a warning.</p>
<p>As for the issuance and trading of company bonds, the difficulties are even greater. In the past year, the enthusiasm for the issuance of company bonds has indeed set a new record since the founding of the Republic. To our knowledge, the amount of bonds issued by companies such as the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company (4.5 million yuan), the Liuhegou Coal Mine Company (2.5 million yuan for the second issuance), the Qixin Cement Company (1.9 million yuan), the Yongli Chemical Industries Company (4 million yuan), the Jiangnan Railway Company (2 million yuan), the Minsheng Industrial Company (1 million yuan for the first issuance), and the Maochang Refrigeration Company (600,000 yuan) is quite considerable. Although these bonds were publicly solicited, they were mostly underwritten by banks. The number of private buyers was very small. If this is the case, the issuance of company bonds is no different from ordinary mortgage loans. Furthermore, the interest rate of the various company bonds mentioned above is at most 1% per month. The issue price is generally around 95, except for the special case of the Dingnan Railway Company bonds. This is unfavorable compared to government securities. Therefore, even if company bonds can be issued, the obstacles to trading must still be resolved. Otherwise, although the name of borrowing money is given, the stagnation of the bonds will remain. We fear that the deficiencies of the gold market institutions will still be difficult to remedy.</p>

<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Executive Council is scheduled to meet at 10:30 tomorrow morning. (Reuters Dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) It is expected here that the League of Nations Executive Council will appoint a committee tomorrow to report on the full discussion of the Italian-Ethiopian dispute and make recommendations. If these recommendations are not subsequently approved by the full Executive Council, then either party in the dispute will be legally entitled to wage war after a three-month period. Today, the Italian representative Aloisi met with the French Foreign Minister Laval. Laval also met with the British Minister Without Portfolio Eden for 19 minutes. The League of Nations Assembly is likely to adjourn sine die on Saturday, with the proviso that it can be reconvened with 48 hours' notice. This is because once the Assembly is closed, it will take at least three weeks to reconvene. (National Telegram, 25th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) French Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Laval met with Italian representative Aloisi this morning, followed by Eden. The three then discussed all aspects of the Italian-Ethiopian issue, focusing on how to end the conflict. It has now been agreed that the Executive Council will meet on Thursday to review the report of the Five-Power Committee and form a special committee to further consult with the representatives of both parties and arbitrate the entire issue. This approach is permitted under Article 15, Paragraph 3 of the League of Nations Covenant. Once this committee is established, it will draft recommendations similar to the report of today's Five-Power Committee. The British representative proposed that the League of Nations Assembly temporarily adjourn on Friday, but the session must continue so that it can be convened at any time. This is because once the Assembly is closed, it will take at least three weeks to reconvene. (National Telegram, 25th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) French Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Laval met this morning with Italian representative Aloisi and British Minister Without Portfolio Eden. It is reported that the French delegation believes that the most urgent task for the League of Nations Executive Council is to request the Ethiopian government to submit a reply to the points raised in Italy's memorandum of September 4 accusing that country. It is generally believed that once the Executive Council receives this reply, it can appoint a special committee to review the Italian memorandum and this reply to determine the truth. As for whether the Executive Council's scheduled meeting tomorrow to discuss the report submitted by the subcommittee will be postponed until the weekend, it is still unknown. (Havas Dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The mediation efforts in the Italian-Ethiopian dispute have now temporarily come to an end. The Five-Power Committee passed the report on the failure of mediation after discussing it for two hours today. It is said that the report will be published soon. It does not contain any conclusions, only a restatement of the committee's recommendations, the Ethiopian government's response, and the oral notification from the Italian representative Sir Aloisi to the committee chairman Madariaga. What is noteworthy is that the committee has not yet decided to hand over the mediation task to the Executive Council, but will continue to await further instructions. The Executive Council will meet on Thursday to discuss this report and decide on future steps. Any possible new developments within the next 24 hours will also be given due consideration. It is generally believed here that mediation has not reached a dead end, and the British ambassador's talk with Prime Minister Mussolini last night may open up new hope, leading to a successful negotiation. This hope is based on Italy's denial of submitting a counter-proposal.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the sudden indefinite postponement of Italy's nationwide civilian mobilization exercise is also considered quite significant here, although there is no criticism of it. (National Telegram, 24th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Five-Member Special Committee today submitted to the League of Nations Executive Council a report on the Italian-Ethiopian dispute, acknowledging that its efforts had failed. The report does not draw any conclusions, but merely outlines the facts of the process. The Executive Council is scheduled to consider it on Thursday. It is widely believed that the Executive Council will simply endorse the report and then proceed in accordance with Article 15, Paragraph 4 of the League of Nations Covenant. This paragraph stipulates that "if the dispute cannot be resolved in this way, the Council, by a unanimous or majority vote, shall issue a report stating the facts of the dispute and the recommendations that the Council deems fair and appropriate." The Executive Council is likely to adopt the Five-Member Special Committee's plan for the League of Nations to oversee the reorganization of Ethiopia's various public affairs with the assistance of European advisors. It will then pass recommendations to both parties, who will have three months to accept them. In this case, the responsibility for a decision will rest with Italy. If Italy rejects the recommendations or resorts to force, it will immediately be placed in the position of an aggressor and can be subjected to sanctions by the League of Nations. Some representatives met here today to discuss procedural issues. It is reported that there is a movement to invoke the Plan for Preventing War, drafted two years ago. Eden and Laval will also meet tomorrow to discuss procedural issues. This meeting is expected to be even more important. It is generally believed that a committee should be established to make fair and appropriate recommendations. While the committee is working, representatives from several countries can take the opportunity to return to their capitals temporarily. Many representatives are now eager to return home to handle political affairs. (Reuters Dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The pessimistic news from Geneva seems to strengthen the French opinion that sanctions will inevitably be implemented. It is widely believed that Mussolini has disregarded all mediation efforts and is determined to wage war in East Africa. However, optimists predict that after a few victories by the Italian army, Mussolini will comply with the resolutions of Geneva. The postponement of the Executive Council meeting to consider the Five-Member Special Committee report until Thursday is welcome, as it is felt that the representatives should be given ample time to study the results of the British-Italian cabinet meetings. This decision also allows French Prime Minister Laval to consider the British government's response to his inquiry regarding the Austrian situation. It is reported that the British cabinet approved the draft response yesterday. (Reuters Dispatch, 25th)</p>
<h3 id="e51">Five-Power Committee Report Released; Describes the Failure of Mediation; Full Text is Four Pages and Contains No Conclusions <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>(Geneva) The report submitted by the Italian-Ethiopian Dispute Subcommittee to the Executive Council was released by the League of Nations Secretariat this morning. The full text is very short, only four pages. Its content is almost entirely used to describe the committee's work process. It does not make any judgments on the Italian-Ethiopian dispute, nor does it draw any conclusions. It also includes three documents: one is the recommendation made by the committee chairman Madariaga to the Italian and Ethiopian delegations on September 18, two is the Ethiopian government's response on September 23, and three is the oral opinion presented by the Italian representative Aloisi to the committee chairman Madariaga on September 22. The most noteworthy is the oral opinion presented by Aloisi. The first part explains the best solution that Italy advocates for resolving the Ethiopian issue, and the second part criticizes the recommendations made by the subcommittee. Regarding the first part, Italy argues that (a) Ethiopia should be placed under certain conditions to ensure the safety of countries whose territories border it, namely, to reorganize the country's administration so that it can reach a higher level of civilization; (b) all tribal peoples neighboring Italian territories who are under Ethiopia's harsh rule should be liberated. Regarding the second part, it is divided into six items as follows: (a) The subcommittee's recommendations do not consider whether Ethiopia is qualified to be a member state of the League of Nations or that Ethiopia joined the League of Nations under special circumstances; (b) the League of Nations originally aimed to improve Ethiopia's level of civilization, but the state co-management system advocated in the subcommittee's recommendations cannot achieve this, because if Ethiopia retains a strong modern military, its current barbaric customs cannot be abolished; (c) the League of Nations Covenant does not apply to countries similar to Ethiopia, because the Covenant does not stipulate how to deal with situations where countries that do not meet the qualifications of a member state infringe on other countries' rights and violate international obligations; (d) Italy's special position in Ethiopia does not allow Ethiopia to have access to the sea, because if Ethiopia has access to the sea, its continuous threat to Italian territories will become more serious, and this point is also not considered by the subcommittee; (e) the 1906 Anglo-French-Italian Treaty recognized Italy's territorial rights in Ethiopia, that is, Ethiopia ceding land so that Italian Somaliland and Eritrea could be connected, but the subcommittee ignored this; (f) although the subcommittee recognized Italy's special economic interests in Ethiopia, these special interests must be based on a special agreement signed between Italy and Ethiopia, and therefore Ethiopia must be sincere. Since that country has no willingness and ability to respect international agreements and the guarantees it provides, Italy has no possibility of signing an agreement with it.

<p>(London) The British Cabinet has decided to continue with naval precautionary measures in the Mediterranean and to study the extent to which the British naval fleet can obtain the assistance of the land and naval forces of League of Nations member states in the event of an incident between Britain and Italy. The simultaneous issuance of communiqués by Britain and Italy a few days ago, declaring that their respective military measures in the Mediterranean did not contain any aggressive intent, eased the tense relationship between the two countries, but this easing has now vanished. The Italian government's criticism of the Five-Member Small Committee's report, considering it not to be a possible basis for establishing an agreement, has further convinced British officials that Italy must attack Ethiopia and that economic sanctions are inevitable. If economic sanctions are implemented, then incidents between the British and Italian fleets in the Mediterranean are bound to occur, which is what everyone is concerned about. (Havas Dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>(London) The Cabinet held a plenary meeting today, at which Foreign Secretary Hoare reported on the developments in the Ethiopian affair and the results of the talks held yesterday by the British Ambassador to Italy, Drummond, with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini. The British Cabinet expressed satisfaction with the communiqués issued simultaneously in London and Rome a few days ago, declaring that the military measures taken by Britain and Italy in the Mediterranean and the Red Sea were purely of a precautionary nature and did not contain any aggressive intent, believing that the tense relationship between Britain and Italy had eased as a result. In addition, the French government, through its ambassador to Britain, Corbin, inquired of the British government a few days ago, stating that "Britain is now taking a firm stance in Geneva on the Italian-Ethiopian issue. If something happens in Central Europe, especially if Austria is invaded, will Britain also take the same firm stance?" Regarding this question from France, the British Foreign Office has prepared a response, which has been approved by today's Cabinet meeting and is expected to be delivered to the French government within the week.

If Britain and France decide to impose sanctions on Italy, then all the people of Southeastern Europe, with the exception of Bulgaria and Hungary, and parts of Austria, will fully agree.

<p>(Rome) The next cabinet meeting has been scheduled for the 26th of this month. No semi-official comments have been made on the communiqué issued by today's cabinet meeting. However, political figures believe that the Five-Power Unorganized Committee did not consider the memorandum submitted by the Italian government to the League of Nations Executive Council on September 4, which is regrettable. In that memorandum, the Italian government stated that it was unwilling to hold negotiations with Ethiopia on an equal footing. It is hoped that the League of Nations Executive Council can remedy this in the future. It is considered that two points in the general aspect deserve special attention: First, Article 23 of the League of Nations Covenant stipulates that member states allow "ensuring fair and humane labor conditions" and "maintaining fair treatment for the people in the governed territories," and "maintaining freedom of transportation and transit" within the territories of each member state. Ethiopia has failed to fulfill these obligations, and therefore Ethiopia has lost its qualifications as a member state of the League of Nations. Second, Article 22 of the League of Nations Covenant stipulates that advanced countries may protect backward countries as League of Nations mandate countries. According to this article, it would be a correct solution to make Ethiopia an Italian mandate territory. At the very least, the land recently annexed by Ethiopia should be placed under Italian mandate management. (Havas Dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>(Rome) An Italian government spokesman recently told a Havas Agency reporter, "Regarding the Ethiopian issue, Italy is now awaiting further proposals from the League of Nations.

<p>(Geneva): The League of Nations' Committee of Five is preparing to halt its mediation efforts. League of Nations experts are now focusing on the possibility that the United States might sell goods to Italy if various countries impose economic sanctions. The experts are deeply concerned about how to legally address the situation if the United States disregards the League of Nations' economic sanctions and sells large quantities of goods like cotton, kerosene, and copper to Italy. The recent U.S. Neutrality Act does not authorize the President to prohibit the export of goods to belligerent nations. Therefore, implementing sanctions against Italy may require undermining Italy's creditworthiness. (National Telegram, 24th)</p>

<p>(Berlin): According to sources here, it is anticipated today that Germany will not participate in the European dispute caused by Italy's actions. The German government believes that a strict neutral stance is a natural consequence of improved Anglo-German friendship and that Germany would gain nothing by joining either side. However, by staying out of it, Germany can demonstrate to the world that its approach to European relations is one of peace. Local newspapers believe that Italian newspapers are exaggerating the relationship between Germany and Lithuania in an attempt to divert the attention of Britain and the League of Nations, causing them to slightly forget about Italy's serious situation.

<p>Capital of Sweden: Most newspapers here support the proposals put forward by Foreign Minister Sandler at the League of Nations Assembly.

Therefore, they advocate maintaining strict neutrality in the Italo-Abyssinian dispute. Conservative newspapers believe that Sweden's participation in sanctions, even if they are economic in nature, is fraught with danger. Sweden's concern lies in the increasingly tense situation in Northern Europe, particularly the Memel issue. In the event of an accident, Sweden would have to take military measures against Germany, making it difficult to address the Italo-Abyssinian issue. (Havas Telegram, 25th)</p>
<h3 id="e75">London Financiers Pay Attention to Gold Flowing to the U.S.; Concerned That Silver Prices Will Rise Again <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>(New York): It is reported that the gold shipped to New York yesterday was worth a total of $11,700,000, with $6,900,000 from Britain, $3,100,000 from France, $900,000 from the Netherlands, and $800,000 from India. (Reuters Telegram, 24th)</p>
<p>(London): Financiers are now paying close attention to the inflow of gold to the United States, being concerned that silver prices will rise again. Up to September 21, gold shipped to the United States was estimated to be worth £30,000,000. Since then, all gold shipped to the U.S. has increased greatly, so the amount of silver that must be purchased under the Silver Purchase Act will naturally increase accordingly. Although the United States has already purchased 500,000,000 ounces of silver, the amount of silver needed by the U.S. Treasury under the Silver Purchase Act has only decreased by 71,000,000 ounces due to the recent increase in gold reserves. The Treasury still needs to acquire 1,251,000,000 ounces of silver to meet the gold-silver ratio stipulated by the Silver Purchase Act. Furthermore, the only way for the U.S. to prevent the depreciation of the British pound against the U.S. dollar is to purchase silver. This is why the price the U.S. is willing to pay for silver has risen from August to 31.25. Financiers believe that once the Italo-Abyssinian crisis is resolved, the current cause of rising silver prices will change. They hope speculators will not forget the lessons learned in August. (Reuters Telegram, 24th)</p>
<p>Chicago: Speaking at the American Metallurgical Society meeting here today, Chairman Bronwell said that the future of silver is brighter than at any time in the past fifteen years. The basic intention of the Silver Purchase Act is not, as some people say, to immediately buy up the full amount and push the price of silver to $1.29 per ounce. Such a move would quickly exhaust America's purchasing power, and ultimately, silver prices would inevitably plummet. The future of silver should be viewed with a long-term perspective, depending on whether the use of silver coins expands when the world's monetary system stabilizes in the future. The chairman mentioned the plight of countries such as China and Mexico due to the U.S. silver purchase policy, and said that what is needed now is a stable price that encourages rather than destroys the use of silver coins. He opposes further raising the world silver price. He believes that silver should be fixed at a price of around 60 cents per ounce. Because too high silver price will reduce the use of silver in industry, and silver price too low below 60 cents, will not be appropriate because it has risen and then fall. In short, the stability of the two prices is extremely important to the future of silver. Although he is not opposed to raising the domestic silver price, why should the United States pay the high price of $1.29 when most of the silver it needs can be purchased at a cost of around 60 cents? At the same time, Senator Wheeler also expressed his opinion, opposing the Treasury's silver purchase policy, saying that the world silver price could be raised to $1.29 per ounce.

<p>Hua</p>
<p>(40) Visiting the Rural Construction Pilot Zone. On the morning of the 20th, the reporter took a car to Shatang to visit the rural construction pilot zone of the Guangxi Provincial Economic Commission. Shatang is over fifty li from Liuzhou, and the journey takes half an hour by car. The director of the pilot zone, Wu Tingyang, was not present and was received by the secretary, who described the establishment process and organizational situation. It is said that the area was established in March of the 21st year of the Republic and was initially called the Guangxi Reclamation and Water Conservancy Pilot Zone. It was renamed to its current name in July of the 23rd year. The province allocates an annual budget of 20,000 yuan. The total area of the zone is 2,600 square li, making it the largest state-run farm in the province. It is entirely a pilot research institution, and after it achieves success, it will be promoted throughout the province. The goal of the rural construction pilot zone is to improve the lives of farmers and strengthen rural organizations to realize the rural society of the Three Principles of the People. Its implementation guidelines are: (1) Regarding life organization, emphasis is placed on the economic organization movement of cooperatives, establishing three systems: agricultural credit unions, agricultural finance, and various cooperative enterprises. (3) Regarding education, emphasis is placed on the integration of school and education, rural gatherings, and the training of rural service personnel suitable for rural construction in this province. (4) Regarding village administration, the village system organization should maintain the original administrative system and regional principles, but it must be simple, accurate, and convenient for various facilities. Those already established include the Shatang Experimental Farm, which also operates the Liucheng Sugarcane Farm, and branch farms in Shibeiping and Wuyou. The Shatang, Shibeiping, and Wuyou oil factories, sugar factories, and starch factories are all related to production and development. The Shatang Credit Union, Shatang Shibeiping, Wuyou warehouses, and public stores are related to rural economic organization. In terms of education, there is the Shatang School, with one qualification being graduation from junior high school after three years of study, with tuition waived and a stipend provided. The second is young settlers, who are taught practical skills and engage in part-time farming and part-time study. Other activities include immigration and reclamation. Since the 13th year of the Republic, over 2,500 surplus people from Weiyong, Cenbei, and other counties have been relocated to Shatang, Shibeiping, Shapu, Liuzhou, Wuyou, and other places to engage in reclamation, opening up more than 20,000 mu of farmland. Initially, machines were used to cultivate the wasteland, and then national manpower and animal power were used, with each able-bodied man being given 20 mu of land as a standard. Young women are also included in the ranks of able-bodied men. Settler families are provided with housing by this office, as well as all farming implements. Each family is loaned one to several head of cattle. The harvest of the settlers is divided into three and seven, with three parts going to the public and seven parts being used for their living expenses. Later, I accompanied them to visit the offices and other places. The Shatang Public Store and warehouse are located on the lower level of the experimental area office. I also took a car to travel through the fields and reached the improved sugarcane farm. The sugarcane was already taller than people, and the green leaves waved in the wind. It was boundless. A certain gentleman pointed out and explained, "This is the local variety, this is the improved variety, and this is the Taiwan variety." The local variety has thin and short stems, the improved variety is thicker and longer, and the Taiwan variety is the best. It is said that the first year of trial planting resulted in the local farmers' planting being better than the improved variety. It was said that theory is not as good as experience. The following year, the improved variety was far superior to the local variety. This year, the local variety is even smaller, and the villagers began to admire that experience is not as good as theory. Along the way, male and female settlers worked diligently, and shepherds chased after each other for fun. They were all happy and contented and could be said to have gained natural pleasure in their diligence. I also visited the houses where the settlers lived. The ten walls of mud and grass and the architecture were extremely simple. Each house was inhabited by two to four families, but they were still clean. Each family had a small living room, with a statue of Guan Gong for worship. The women were busy nursing and cleaning. After walking another li, I reached Shatang School. Some of the buildings were not yet completed, and the appearance was very grand. The interior classrooms and auditoriums were well-lit and could accommodate dozens of people. Students in the national elementary school were in class, using a small teacher system, which was very effective. Next to the school are the small villas donated by Li Baihuang and the late Ye Qi, with each house costing from 5,000 to 10,000 yuan to build. They were built to promote the idea of urban people going to live in the new countryside. In fact, other than occasionally visiting, Li and others have never lived there, so they are now the residences of school teachers. A certain gentleman firmly invited me to visit the sugar factory, oil factory, starch factory, and other production facilities. Due to lack of time, I declined and returned to Lequn Society at about ten o'clock and departed for Guilin by car at eleven o'clock.</p>
<p>(41) Yangshuo's Scenery is the Best in Guilin</p>
<p>The highway from Liuzhou to Guilin is 540 li. The car crossed the river seven times, passing through Luorong, Luzhai, Liujiang, Xiuren, Sanjiang, Lipu, Maling, Yangshuo, and Liangfeng before reaching Guilin. At 3:00 PM, we had lunch at Lipu Station. Lipu is famous for its taro, with large ones weighing several pounds. After passing Lipu, the mountains seen along the way were all isolated peaks, not connected to each other. The scenery seemed to be near Longzhou. An hour after leaving Lipu, after the last ferry, we reached Yangshuo. From the ferry, looking at the mountains in the distance, they were vaguely shrouded in clouds. The tops of the mountains were twisted and turned like knife mountains and sword forests. Nearby, isolated peaks stood tall, like islands scattered in the sea, protruding from the water. The trees were uneven, and the village houses were half-visible, resembling a wonderful Chinese painting. I hurriedly got out of the car to take more than a dozen photos. After crossing the river, I specially instructed the driver to drive slowly. The scenery became more and more bizarre, and the mountains became more and more numerous. Some stood side by side like ox horns, some towered like pagodas, some were hollow like city gates, some stood sideways like flying swallows, and some were uniquely indescribable. The car traveled through the mountains, and I was excited by the strange scenery. It is said that the landscape of Guilin is the best in the world, and the scenery of Yangshuo is the best in Guilin, which is certainly not an exaggeration. The mountains of Yangshuo have a wonderful natural beauty. They have not been artificially constructed. The mountains have more rocks than soil, making it difficult to grow forests. The tall ridges are steep and dangerous, making them impossible to climb, so there are also few buildings. Nature only provides paintings to embellish the scenery. The mountain itself cannot provide tourists with a place to climb and enjoy the scenery. Approaching the county seat of Yangshuo, pavilions were built on the mountainside, which made it feel even more precious and rare. Leaving Yangshuo, the strange mountains were still in sight, but they were not as surrounded by the mountains of Yangshuo. The highway was also less winding. After seeing it frequently, it turned to feel plain. At half past six, we reached Liangfeng. The Cen Xilin Park was there, but the twilight was vast, and we did not stop to visit. After driving for about an hour from Liangfeng, we reached Guilin. We stayed at the Binhu Hotel prepared by the reception office. Guilin was established as Guilin Xiang County during the Qin Dynasty. During the Han, Jin, Southern Dynasties, and Sui Dynasties, it was called Shian County. It remained so during the early Tang Dynasty. In the 8th year of Zhiguan, it was renamed Lingui County and served as the seat of Guizhou Prefecture. The Five Dynasties, Song, and Yuan Dynasties followed suit. During the Ming Dynasty, Guilin Prefecture was the seat of the Guangxi Province. The Qing Dynasty followed this pattern. Scholars gathered here for the imperial examinations. The mountains and rivers were beautiful, and talents emerged in large numbers. Even today, the academies stand tall. The prosperity of culture has not diminished. Li Zongren, Bai Chongxi, and Ma Junwu are all from Guilin, so it is the center of the cultural area of the entire province. That evening, I took a short tour of the city. Merchants gathered, the roads were wide, and the bustling areas were brightly lit, resembling a miniature version of Beiping. The new buildings are emerging, but they have not been able to hide the feudal colors of the old days.</p>
<h3 id="e104">Prelude to Sino-Japanese Economic Cooperation: The Hebei Cotton Industry Unification and Improvement Association Guiding Planting Techniques, This Year Hebei Cotton Production Increased by Another 170,000 Dan <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>In the midst of the Sino-Japanese economic cooperation, the cotton industry issue in Hebei Province is quite important. Japan has been using a lot of Chinese cotton in recent years, so unifying the authority of the Hebei cotton industry is especially important. The Hebei Provincial Cotton Industry Improvement Association held its first board meeting at 2:00 PM yesterday at the Beiping Banking Association in Xipi City. The attendees included Chairman Zhou Zuomin (Beiping Banking Association), Directors Zhang Yuanshan (Economic Commission Cotton Control Committee), Gu Tong (Beining Railway Bureau), Tang Chengbo (Tianjin Commodity Inspection Bureau of the Ministry of Industry), Lv Xian (Hebei Construction Department), and Yuan Songzhou (Hebei Cotton Industry Improvement Institute), a total of six people. Chairman Zhou Zuomin presided over the meeting, and the following important cases were resolved: (1) Approved the office rules of the General Affairs Department and Technical Department of the Board of Directors; (2) Approved the guidelines for promoting the cotton industry and supervising improved seeds; (3) Approved the methods for improving cotton production; (4) Purchased 300 shi of long-staple cotton seeds (Chinese seeds) to promote cotton production; (5) Decided to take over various cotton industry organizations in Hebei Province next month, and the Association will implement supervision and guidance; (6) Planned to allocate the Association's funds, to be borne by various group members. According to Association Director Lv Weidan, Hebei Province is an important cotton-producing area. There are many improved cotton industry organizations within the province, and their authority is not unified. Therefore, the central and local governments have jointly organized this Association to standardize them. Zhou Zuomin has been elected as the chairman. The Association plans to send personnel to take over the Hebei Cotton Industry Improvement Institute, the North China Agricultural Improvement Society established by the Cotton Control Committee of the Economic Commission, and the cotton industry improvement organizations established by the Ministry of Industry, the Beining Railway Bureau, and private individuals next month. Except that the funds will still be allocated by their original affiliated organizations, the design of their cotton seed experiments and other technologies will be approved and implemented by the Association starting next year. All will directly receive the supervision and command of the Association. At the same time, the Association will take overall responsibility for promoting cotton production, cotton field water conservancy, and improving transportation and sales in Hebei Province. The detailed rules of the General Affairs Department and Technical Department of the Board of Directors have been approved today. The General Affairs Department is divided into documents, general affairs, and accounting. The Technical Department is divided into survey, experiment, and design. They will be published after being sorted out. The second Board of Directors meeting will be held in a few days. Before the Association's headquarters is located, it will temporarily work at the address of the Ping Bank Association.</p>
<p>In the 21st year of the Republic, Hebei cotton fields were only 5,143,000 mu. In the 22nd year of the Republic, they increased to over 6 million mu. In the 23rd year of the Republic, they increased to over 7,800,000 mu (accounting for 17% of the total cotton fields in the country). According to a survey by the Tianjin Commodity Inspection Bureau, cotton fields have increased by another 200,000 mu this year. As cotton fields have increased, cotton production has also increased accordingly. In the 21st year of the Republic, its production was about 1.2 million dan. In the 22nd year of the Republic, it was over 1.4 million dan. In the 23rd year of the Republic, it was over 2.8 million dan (accounting for 25% of the national production). It is estimated that this year, it will increase by another 170,000 dan. Originally, Jiangsu and Hubei were the leaders in domestic cotton production, followed by Hebei and Shandong provinces. Judging from the situation in recent years, Hebei's production has exceeded Shandong Province and is second only to Jiangsu and Hubei. However, the area of cotton fields in Hebei now only accounts for 6% of the province's arable land, and there is much room for development. Increasing production by two or even three times will not be difficult. (24th)</p>
<h3 id="e105">The Pinghan Railway Implements a Seven-Year Rehabilitation Plan with an Investment of 20 Million, to be Completed in Five Phases, Construction of a New Railway Bridge over the Yellow River This Year <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>The Pinghan Railway Administration believes that the railway has suffered from military influences in the past decade, the tracks have been poorly maintained, and there is a shortage of vehicles. As a result, the railway's revenue has been in short supply and its debts have increased. In order to effectively reorganize it, a number of experts were gathered to study it in detail and determine a seven-year rehabilitation plan. It has been submitted to the Ministry of Railways and forwarded to the Executive Yuan for approval. The instructions have recently arrived in Hankou. The content of the plan is divided into four items: engineering, machinery, transportation, and finance. It will be implemented in five phases over seven years, with a total budget of 22,220,000 yuan. Regarding engineering, 500,000 sleepers will be replaced annually, 5,500 tons of steel rails will be purchased, 70 sets of turnout sleepers will be replaced at each station, and 70 turnouts will be purchased. All bridges along the railway, except for the Xinle Fengcun Bridge, which must be rebuilt, will be handled in stages and sections according to the urgency of the situation, including (1) Hankou to Xinyang, (2) Xinyang to Yancheng, (3) Yancheng to the south bank of the Yellow River, (4) Shijiazhuang to Beiping, (5) North bank of the Yellow River to Shijiazhuang. What is particularly important is the Yellow River Iron Bridge, which has long exceeded its insurance period. The river is turbulent and dangerous situations often occur. It is estimated that the cost of rebuilding will be 7,500,000 yuan. Important designs, such as the location of the new bridge, the length of the span, the type of bridge piers, and the type of steel beams, have all been stipulated. Construction will begin in the 25th year and is limited to five years. Regarding the mechanical aspects, no locomotives or vehicles have been purchased since the 12th year of the Republic, and parts are also lacking. Most of the vehicles were repaired temporarily to address the emergency. Often, the parts of two or three locomotives were combined into one. It is now planned to purchase 20 locomotives, to be purchased during the peak months of this year. Furthermore, the equipment of the factories will be expanded. It is planned to install the latest steam engines and generators, as well as various special-purpose machines, in the Pinghan factories to produce more parts to meet the needs. Other locomotive sheds will also be equipped with steam engines and boilers, and various special-purpose machines for overhaul will be installed to manufacture parts themselves, so that they will no longer be dependent on the factories. Regarding transportation, it is necessary to seek rapid turnover of operations and flexible vehicle scheduling. Long-distance shunting telephones have been installed between Hankou and Zhengzhou, and their effectiveness is quite obvious. It is planned to complete the line between Zhengzhou and Beiping in the short term so that trains can be centrally dispatched. The traffic lanes at the major stations and the shunting and loading lanes will be divided. All small stations will increase delays. Many stations have not yet been equipped with outer Huai station signals. It is planned to install them one by one, and to add departure signals and distant signals where necessary. The signals and turnouts will be locked to avoid personnel negligence and prevent traffic accidents. Regarding finance, one is to increase railway property. The reorganization funds for the above-mentioned locomotives and two or three items amount to 2.2 million yuan. If loans are used, not only will interest be borne, but it will be like drinking poison to quench thirst, and it will be difficult to borrow this huge amount of money until the railway's credibility is restored. Expenses should be reduced from its own financial resources. The second is to reorganize old debts. The railway administration owes a total of 91 million yuan in domestic and foreign debts, and a reorganization principle has been determined separately for implementation. (21st)</p>
<h3 id="e106">Six Agreed-Upon Measures for Agricultural Technical Cooperation Between Guizhou Province and the Central Government <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>Nanning Dispatch: The Guizhou Provincial Government, recognizing the urgent need for agricultural improvement in the province, has decided to formulate six measures for agricultural technical cooperation with the Central Agricultural Experiment Station. These measures have been entrusted to Lu Shou-geng and Ma Bao-zhi, specialists dispatched by the Station to Guizhou for investigation, to take to Nanjing for negotiation and implementation. The details of these measures are as follows: (1) The Central Agricultural Experiment Station is requested to regularly send personnel to Guizhou to guide the improvement of important crops such as rice, cotton, flax, and sugarcane, for a period of six years. One person will be sent every six months, with a three-year rotation. In the fourth, fifth, and sixth years, personnel will be dispatched in the same order as in the first, second, and third rotations, with each person coming to Guizhou twice during the six years. The travel expenses, board, lodging, and travel costs of the dispatched personnel will be provided by Guizhou, while their salaries will continue to be paid by the Central Agricultural Experiment Station. (2) The Central Agricultural Experiment Station is requested to research important agricultural issues for Guizhou Province and, when necessary, send experts to Guizhou for guidance. Their travel expenses and accommodation costs in Guizhou will be provided by Guizhou. (3) The Central Agricultural Experiment Station is requested to send experts to Guangxi University each year to teach agricultural courses. The types of courses and teaching hours will be directly agreed upon by Guangxi University and the Central Agricultural Experiment Station. (4) An agricultural lecture series will be held once every winter, with the personnel stationed in Guizhou by the Central Agricultural Experiment Station and senior agricultural personnel from Guizhou Province formulating the lecture schedule and inviting agricultural personnel from the province and senior students from Guangxi University to attend and study. (5) The Central Agricultural Experiment Station will provide opportunities for agricultural personnel from Guizhou Province or senior students from Guangxi University to intern at the Central Agricultural Experiment Station each year, taking advantage of the opportunities provided by the agricultural personnel sent to Guizhou Province. The Central Agricultural Experiment Station will also accept approximately three to five trainees each year to stay at the Station for training. Upon completion of the training, they will return to Guizhou to serve. (6) The Central Agricultural Experiment Station will introduce or purchase improved seeds on behalf of the province. Any new seeds collected that are deemed relevant to the agriculture of Guizhou Province will be sent to the province as a sample. The above six measures were agreed upon by the Guizhou Provincial Government and the two specialists Lu and Ma. It is also reported that the Guizhou Provincial Government has appointed Ma Bao-zhi as the agricultural advisor to the province.</p>
<p>Songjiang: Villagers of Baijia Village Robbed</p>
<p>Yang Guai-quan's home, a villager from the fourth household, tenth Jia, second Bao, Thirty-first Tu of Baijia Village, Tinglin, Punan, was invaded at 2:00 AM on the 23rd by sixteen robbers speaking in mixed dialects. Each was armed with a pistol and other weapons. They entered through the side door, preventing the homeowner from raising an alarm. They ransacked the house and fled after about an hour, firing two shots as a warning. Upon hearing the noise, villagers knew it was a robbery and beat gongs to gather a crowd and pursue them, recovering the fleeing robbers at the river beach.</p>
<p>Shatian Bureau Closed and Handed Over</p>
<p>The Songjinqing Shatian Bureau, formerly located in Songyi, has recently received provincial orders to merge the Shatian Bureaus of all counties in the province into three bureaus. This county will also be merged. Another office is established in Shanghai. Yesterday, Section Chief Li and three others from the Shanghai Bureau came to pay their respects to the County Magistrate and then went to the Shatian Bureau to take over.</p>
<p>Suzhou: Falling from a Train Results in Death</p>
<p>At 2:48 AM on the 25th, when the Shanghai-Changzhou train arrived at the Suzhou station, a female passenger hurriedly disembarked before the train had come to a complete stop. Due to the crowded conditions, she was pushed from the platform and fell onto the tracks, where the wheels injured her waist. Rescued by railway police, she was still able to speak, identifying herself as Zhang Fan, 60 years old, residing at No. 14, Lane 180, Wangjia Residence, Hanqiao Jiaonan Street, Zhabei, Shanghai. She stated that she was traveling from Shanghai to Suzhou to return to her ancestral home in Zhujiaqiao, Huangniqiao. She then succumbed to her injuries and died. At 5:00 PM, the local court arrived to examine the body. The station has notified the family in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Widening of the City Market Falls Short</p>
<p>The Wuxian Construction Bureau has been widening the east-west central market of Jinmen for four months since work began. The road surface work has been completed. However, regarding the sidewalks on both sides, the Construction Bureau advocated paving with concrete, while merchants insisted that the east-west central market is the busiest area of Suzhou, and the impression it makes depends on paving with cement. The Construction Bureau claimed that paving with cement would be very expensive, requiring more than 20,000 yuan, and instructed the shops to raise the money themselves. Therefore, the shops expressed deep dissatisfaction and unanimously contested the decision. No resolution has been reached to date. As a result, the central market project has fallen short. Currently, more than 300 shops in the east-west central market have jointly elected Rong Faqin as their representative to appeal to the authorities, further requesting that the method of widening Hulong Street be followed, with the government issuing 30 yuan per building as compensation for land value loss. Chairman Cheng of the County Chamber of Commerce is now mediating.</p>
<p>Wuxi: Three Newspapers Convicted of Libel</p>
<p>The Ren, Dao, and Xinmin three newspapers of this county were previously sued for libel for publishing a murder case in Caoqiao. The Wuxi court summoned both plaintiff and defendant for court hearings, and the arguments have concluded. Yesterday, Judge Liu Bingzhen announced the verdict, stating: "In the case of Xu Xiyin, Ji Xilin, Xiao Yun, and Yun continuing to disseminate libelous writings, each is fined 10 yuan, with a two-year suspended sentence. If the fine is enforced and they are unable to pay, they will serve one day of labor service for each yuan. Xu Xiyin, Ji Xilin, and Qian Xiaoyun shall jointly publish the verdict in the Ren Bao, Guomin Dao Bao, and Xinmin Bao of this county for three days and bear the costs thereof." The three newspapers, being convicted, have indicated their dissatisfaction and intend to appeal to the Jiangsu High Court.</p>
<p>Yangzhou: County Appoints Anti-Smoking Committee Members</p>
<p>The county government of this county, pursuant to Article 3 of the "Organizational Regulations for County Anti-Smoking Committees" issued by the Department of Civil Affairs, which states that the county anti-smoking committee shall consist of five to seven members, to be appointed by the county government from local individuals who are sincerely committed to anti-smoking and are impartial, and that the committee shall elect three standing committee members to handle daily affairs and implement resolutions, the county anti-smoking committee of this county resolved during the thirty-ninth county administration meeting yesterday to appoint Zhou Guren, Zhu Ganchen, Dai Xingyi, Zhang Jichuan, Hong Keting, Wang Jizhi, and Ruan Naigu to serve as committee members.</p>
<p>Eastern Township: Rats Cross River Holding Tails</p>
<p>In Dongliuji Village, Sima Township, eastern Jiangdu, there is a branch of the Outer River that is very deep and narrow. Suddenly, at around 5:00 AM on the 23rd, a giant rat resembling a civet cat led hundreds of rats, holding tails together, swimming north across the branch river, resembling a long snake. An elderly neighbor, Zhou Gui-fu (approximately 70 years old), who was taking a morning walk to that location, watched for a long time, observing that their order was orderly and had the appearance of a marching formation.</p>
<p>Zhenjiang: Banning the Mooring of Timber Rafts on the Riverbank</p>
<p>In the past, the Zhenjiang riverbank was a bustling hub of commerce with numerous sails gathered. As a result, the water flow slowed down, and silt accumulated, forcing the main current north, causing the sandbanks on the south bank to increase year by year, while the Liuwei Guazhou area on the north bank has collapsed over time, forming the phenomenon of a dead port today. Recently, ten gentlemen from the provincial capital have been seeking ways to dredge the port. The Construction Department is also planning to reorganize the Zhenjiang port in conjunction with the Yangtze River Reorganization Committee. However, to prevent silt from accumulating again, it seems necessary to first remove obstacles such as ships and timber rafts that have been moored on the riverbank for a long time. The Provincial Capital Construction Office has taken note of this and decided during a recent meeting to send a letter to the Construction Department to forward to the Department of Civil Affairs, ordering its subordinates to take effective measures to ban the mooring of ships and timber rafts along the riverbank to protect the port. It is reported that the official letter has been issued by the office.</p>
<p>Changzhou: Lake Bandits Appear, Troops Dispatched for Defense</p>
<p>The businesses in Xueyanqiao Township, which borders the lake in Wuyi County, have recently been concerned about the unpredictable appearances of lake bandits and the local security situation. They have specifically submitted a request to the county government for troops to be dispatched for defense. On the 24th, County Magistrate Hou ordered Zhou Decun, the captain of the Third Security Company, to dispatch troops to suppress the bandits. Captain Zhou then sent Wu Yunqing, the second platoon leader, to lead a team of two squads of soldiers to Xueyanqiao on the 26th to be stationed for defense.</p>
<p>Nantong: Dasheng Yarn Factory Seeks Loans</p>
<p>The Nantong Dasheng Yarn Factory and the Jiangjiaqiao branch factory have recently been in contact with a Tong-Shanghai banking consortium to negotiate credit loans, which are expected to come to fruition soon. The banking consortium and the Dasheng Factory have previously had dealings, with 4 million yuan in credit loans and more than 1 million yuan in advance exchange, all flowing into the Dasheng Factory's existing yarn and cloth inventory and various raw materials. Renewing the agreement should not be a problem.</p>
<p>Xu Zhen Inspects County Military and Police</p>
<p>Xu Zhen, commander of the Nantong District Security, inspected the county's security team, public security bureau police, and district security team squad leader training class at Xiaoying in the west of the city on the morning of the 21st at 8:00 AM. He instructed them to uphold military discipline, pacify the countryside, and love the people. Chief of Staff Peng Longxiang also pointed out areas for improvement.</p>
<p>Hangzhou: Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Extension Postponed to Tong-Yiyang</p>
<p>The track-laying work on the southern section of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway was originally scheduled to extend to Yiyang by the end of this month. However, due to a bridge that requires some time to construct on the route from Hengfeng to Yiyang, it will be difficult to complete by the end of the month. Therefore, the opening of the Hengfeng to Yiyang section of the railway must be postponed to the beginning of next month. The engineering materials for the two major bridges at Guixi Liangjiadu have gradually arrived. Completion is expected by the end of October or the beginning of November.</p>
<p>Haimen: Supervisory Commissioner Visits Haimen for Inspection</p>
<p>Xu Zhen, administrative supervisory commissioner and security commander of Nantong District, having completed inspections in counties such as Tong, Ru, and Jing, arrived in Haimen from Tong on the morning of the 24th at 8:00 AM, accompanied by Secretary Sheng Yishan and Chief of Staff Peng Xiaochao. Leaders from all sectors gathered at the bus station to welcome him. After arriving in Haimen, Xu first went to Xinggan (Haimen Hotel) for a short rest. At 9:00 AM, he inspected the 19th Brigade of the Provincial Security Team and the Public Security Bureau police at the public sports field. In the afternoon, he personally inspected county administration. On the afternoon of the 25th, he went to Sanjiang Township and inspected the Second Brigade of the Industrial Security Team. On the 26th, he went to Qidong, and on the 28th, he went to Chongming. After completing the inspections, he will begin to formulate policy guidelines.

<h3 id="e107">Xu Shiying Returned to Shanghai Yesterday: Discusses Surveying Disaster Conditions in Northern Jiangsu; Pi, Tong, Pei, and Feng Counties Suffered the Most; Diverting the Yellow River into the Sea Still Awaits Discussion of Methods; Jiangsu Provincial Government Decides on Three-Phase Relief Measures <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>A Central News Agency report: Xu Shiying, chairman of the Relief Commission, recently went to Nanjing and then to Northern Jiangsu to inspect the flood situation in various counties. He returned to Shanghai by express train on the night of the 23rd and, upon arriving yesterday morning, immediately consulted with those responsible for raising funds for the water disaster relief associations in Shanghai to discuss continuing fundraising methods and investigating the distribution of relief funds and materials. A Central News Agency reporter visited Mr. Xu at the water disaster relief association yesterday afternoon. According to his account, the inspection and relief measures are as follows:</p>
<p>The Flood Situation in Northern Jiangsu Is Still Not Optimistic</p>
<p>According to Mr. Xu, after leaving Shanghai, I made a brief stop in Nanjing and then went to Northern Jiangsu to inspect the flood situation. The cause of this flood was the rise of the Yellow River, which failed to be blocked in Shandong, resulting in it entering the Grand Canal and Bulao River via Weishan Lake. Wherever it passed, it caused flooding. Therefore, the disaster in Northern Jiangsu will not end until the breach in Shandong is blocked. The floodwaters are now receding, but without proper follow-up measures, optimism is still not possible.</p>
<p>Pi, Tong, Pei, and Feng Suffered the Most</p>
<p>Fortunately, this flood occurred in the autumn, and most agricultural products were already ripe and harvested quickly, minimizing the impact. However, property losses were still significant. If the floodwaters do not recede quickly, it will be difficult to plant new crops, and a spring famine next year is unavoidable. The affected areas include the four counties of Pi, Tong, Pei, and Feng, with Pi County being the worst affected, almost eighty to ninety percent of which was submerged.</p>
<p>Diverting the Yellow River into the Sea Is Being Planned</p>
<p>The disaster in Northern Jiangsu is truly not small. The fact that the disaster was relatively light in some areas is due to the effective cooperation between officials and people in Jiangsu Province. The current relief method is to divert the waters of the Yellow River into the Liutang River to the sea and to build up the dikes. I have exchanged views with Chairman Chen Guofu of Jiangsu Province on diverting the river water into the Liutang River, and we are both paying close attention to this matter. As soon as a plan is developed, we will begin implementation to prevent Northern Jiangsu from suffering from river floods again.</p>
<p>Fundraising Continues</p>
<p>Since the Yellow River and Yangtze River floods occurred one after another, the Relief Commission has allocated 45,000 yuan for distribution in the affected provinces. During my trip to Northern Jiangsu, I carried 11,794 yuan for distribution. The relief associations have raised 180,000 yuan and are continuing to raise funds. The funds will be remitted to various provinces for investigation and distribution as needed.</p>
<p>Will Return to Nanjing to Handle Relief Affairs</p>
<p>Regarding the matter of civil servants deducting salaries to assist in relief, the central government has decided to implement measures, which will be put into effect soon. It is estimated that 5 million yuan can be donated in Nanjing. I will not stay in Shanghai for long and will go to Nanjing soon, as there are still unfinished matters in Nanjing that need to be handled. Therefore, I am scheduled to go to Nanjing again on the 29th and will probably return to Shanghai in early next month. In the coming days, I will individually consult with those responsible for the relief associations to discuss all progress. After I return to Shanghai next month, I will convene a meeting to discuss everything.</p>
<p>Relief Measures Divided into Three Phases</p>
<p>Regarding the disaster situation in Jiangsu Province, Cheng Jingsheng, director of the Jiangsu Province Investigation and Distribution, stated in a letter to Commissioner Xu that the details are very clear. The following is a copy of the letter: "Respected President Jinglao, I was fortunate to follow you. I am deeply grateful for your kind words. After we parted at Jianggan, I immediately proceeded to Nanzu from Shanghai to meet with Chairman Wuxing, who was coming to Nanjing. I was unable to attend the preparatory Huaihe meeting. I entrusted Director Jing Gong to deliver the 2,000 yuan relief funds for Suqian. The next afternoon, at a temporary meeting of the relief society, the relief measures for this province were discussed. Jingsheng reported on the disaster situation, announced De Yi, and described the dangerous situations I encountered. Everyone present expressed their gratitude and asked me to forward their thanks to you. I will send another letter by mail. Regarding the relief measures, we have decided to divide them into three phases. The first phase is for saving lives, providing shelter, banning the slaughter of cattle, registering disaster-stricken households, migrating people to the Huaihe area, and distributing medicine. The second phase will be implemented according to the investigation and distribution procedures of the Shanghai Relief Association, including distributing relief funds, giving out winter clothing, providing funds to return disaster victims to their farms, and organizing work relief. The third phase will be for providing loans for purchasing seeds, managing price equalization, implementing spring relief, and expanding work relief. For the second and third phases of investigation and distribution, we have specifically stipulated that the relief work will be carried out by the sub-association's relief team. An administrative commissioner will be sent to each county to check households and issue labels. The general association will invite relief experts to guide the counties. The funds allocated by the Shanghai Relief Association will be used in the name of Yi in the second phase to extend the staff to investigate half of Pi County, and the strictness of the distribution will be determined by the Yi Association. The amount of funds allocated to each county is based on Jingsheng's disaster survey report and the overall county statistics, with the distribution based on percentages. Pi County will receive 47%, Tong County 23%, Pei County 20%, and Feng County 10%. A batch of relief funds will be issued first to support the first phase of relief work. All funds directly allocated by your office will be included in the first phase for accounting. (The 3,206 yuan allocated to Pi County and stored in the provincial government has already been allocated to the county.) Although Su and Mu have slight border overflows, fortunately, only local areas were affected, and there is no immediate need for relief efforts. However, it is ultimately impossible to avoid expanding the disaster area. The 1,000 yuan for relief in Su will remain in the provincial government for allocation as needed. The receipt will be sent directly to the Shanghai office. I respectfully request your understanding. Jingsheng respectfully rises early in the morning."</p>

<p>Following the death of French Ambassador to China, Mr. Wilden, in Nanjing at 9:00 PM on the 21st due to heart disease, the French Consulate General in Shanghai immediately flew flags at half-mast on the 24th as a mark of mourning. The consulate has scheduled a memorial service for 12:00 PM today at the church on Catholic Church Street in the French Concession. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Mayor Sends Representative to Offer Condolences</p>

Therefore, the news of Mr. Wilden's death was met with widespread mourning.

The coffin will be surrounded by white gauze, with the principal celebrant in the center and guest seating on both sides. The arrangement is simple yet solemn. The surrounding area of the church will be guarded by the French police. The French Consulate General, due to the short notice, was unable to print and distribute invitations to various Chinese and foreign sectors. Therefore, yesterday, personnel from the consulate notified the Shanghai Municipal Government, the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the embassies and consulates in Shanghai by telephone, as well as Mayor Wu Tiecheng and Director Yu Ming of the Foreign Affairs Office, etc., who decided to attend the memorial service in person. It is also understood that the envoys and consuls of various countries in Shanghai will also participate.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council stated that Mr. Wilden, when he was Consul-General in Shanghai, had greatly supported local public works and the administration of the Shanghai Municipal Council, and they had a close relationship. Upon hearing of his sudden death, they expressed their deepest condolences. In addition to ordering the Municipal Council to fly flags at half-mast on the 25th of this month and sending Mr. Langmu and acting business manager Mr. Lipu to attend today's memorial service, they also sent a telegram of condolence to the French Consul General in Shanghai.

After formal protocol, the chairman reported on (1) the minutes of the previous meeting; (2) a letter from the Shanghai Banking Association regarding the request to promulgate specific regulations to stimulate industrial and commercial circulation and to aid industry, now forwarded by the Executive Yuan Secretariat along with a copy of the review records for consideration; and (3) various reports concerning the reserve fund.</p>
<p>The discussion of proposals then commenced: (1) Regarding a letter from the Shanghai National Products Factory Federation requesting long-term lending at 10% interest, and asking to settle interest and renew terms using the 4% interest method, it was resolved to handle the matter as before. (2) Regarding the approval of the draft amendments to the reserve fund charter prepared by the drafting committee, and a request for review in order to submit the draft to the next general meeting of member representatives, it was resolved to approve the draft.

Any withdrawal from a "Hui Tou" account will have its interest calculated at the daily interbank rate. If banks have either excess "Hua Jin" or a shortage of "Hua Tou", they can offset each other. There is no need for separate procedures, which will help to offset the losses. This has been recorded. Please take note and comply accordingly."</p>

<h3 id="e115">The Sluggish Market Affects Shanghai's Real Estate Industry, Leading to a Significant Decline; Current Land Prices Are Only Half of What They Were During the Golden Age; Vacant Houses Increase Daily, But Most Rents Have Not Been Reduced <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the real estate industry in Shanghai is suffering from the effects of a sluggish market, with transactions becoming increasingly rare and little interest in even prime properties. Despite repeated attempts by leaders in the industry to find solutions, no progress has been made. Those who own large amounts of real estate are worried and eager to sell as soon as possible. A reporter has gathered the following information from within the industry:</p>
<p>The Golden Age is Over: The real estate industry enjoyed a golden age from 1929 to 1931. There was fierce competition for prime properties, and prices soared. Land prices on Nanjing Road and the Bund reached over 500,000 yuan per mu. Since 1931, the market has gradually declined, and each year since 1933 has been worse than the last. Currently, while there is no standard price for land on Nanjing Road and the Bund, it is estimated that the value is only half of what it was during the industry's golden age. The main cause of this is the sluggish market, but there are other contributing factors. For example, real estate merchants often mortgage their properties to banks for loans. When they default on these loans, it leads to disputes and lawsuits. As a result, people are hesitant to invest in real estate, which further stagnates the industry and causes prices to fall.</p>
<p>Repeated Attempts Fail: The current state of the real estate industry has significant implications for the social economy, and the future trend is a cause for concern. Leaders in the industry have repeatedly attempted to find solutions, but without success. This spring, major real estate figures such as Gan Linsheng discussed issuing 50 million yuan in real estate circulation vouchers, but the plan failed to gain support and was abandoned. More recently, industry insiders have been discussing establishing a real estate exchange in Shanghai. This plan is currently under consideration, but it is unlikely to be approved by the government. If a real estate exchange were established, it would likely lead to speculation and instability, causing anxiety among the public and affecting the financial market.</p>
<p>Few Real Estate Transactions: The decline of the real estate industry cannot be ignored. The solution should not be limited to a few industry leaders pursuing their own interests by proposing schemes such as real estate circulation vouchers or real estate exchanges. Instead, experts from both China and abroad, along with government officials and knowledgeable individuals from the real estate industry, should come together to discuss solutions that benefit the entire industry. Otherwise, the industry's future will continue to worsen. Currently, there are very few transactions of large properties in Shanghai. Even small transactions are rare. This not only causes losses for property owners but also creates problems for those who rely on the industry for their livelihoods.</p>
<p>Rent Reduction is Only Natural: At a time when the real estate industry is declining, there are increasing calls from tenants for rent reductions. Most landlords in Shanghai still charge rents based on the prices of the real estate industry's golden age. Since land prices are now half of what they were then, rent reductions are only natural. The tenants' demands for rent reductions are due to two main factors: the decline of various industries and the overall economic recession, and the increasing number of vacant houses in the city. The increase in vacant houses is not due to a decrease in the city's population, but because property owners are building more houses because they cannot easily sell their land. This creates an oversupply, which is another symptom of the decline of the real estate industry.</p>
<h3 id="e116">Korean Goodwill Mission Plane Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday Afternoon <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>

<p>News from Korean Plane: The Electric News Agency</p>
<p>Flowers Presented by Japanese and Koreans: The plane, a Salmson biplane with the letters "1-Cagd" on it, appeared in the northwest of the airport at 10:50 AM. After circling the sky once, it landed. Ayako, from the Japanese Consulate General; Namba Masaji, from the United Association of Japanese Residents; Tanaka Mihoko, from the Japanese Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Shanghai; Igarashi Hatsuji, from the Japanese Residents Group; and representatives from the Korean Residents Association presented flowers. Pilots Shin Yong-hang and Sakata then met with the welcoming party.</p>
<p>Visit to the Mayor: The two pilots, with their dark complexions and energetic spirits, went to the Japanese Consulate General to pay their respects and then to Bixun Road to visit Ambassador Arima. They then went to the city center to meet with Mayor Wu. As Mayor Wu was slightly unwell, he was not in the office. Secretary Yu Hongjun, along with Wang Changchun, received them and expressed their welcome. In the afternoon, the Japanese Residents Group held a tea party at the Japanese Club on Peng Road.

<p>The Eurasia Aviation Corporation's giant No. 52 plane on the Shaanxi-Chengdu route, after flying from Shanghai to Chengdu, according to the company, was unable to fly out as scheduled because the Chengdu airport was flooded and the wheels sank into the mud. It has been changed to officially resume flying today. The company's newly revised schedule for all routes will take effect from yesterday. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Resumption Today: The giant No. 52 plane on the Shaanxi-Chengdu route recently made an official test flight from Shanghai via Xi'an. After arriving in Chengdu, it experienced several days of heavy rain, and the company's Fenghuangshan Airport was still under construction and not yet completed. Many of the low-lying areas within the airport had not yet been filled in. After continuous heavy rain, there was a lot of water accumulation. When the plane arrived in Chengdu and landed, because the fuselage was extremely heavy, the wheels sank deep into the mud. The originally scheduled date for the official opening of the route yesterday was therefore blocked and unable to take off. The local company in Shanghai received the above telegram and has replied instructing that the date be changed to today.</p>
<p>Increased Frequency on All Routes: The company's original routes have been increased in frequency and revised schedules, which took effect yesterday. (1) The Shanghai-Xinjiang route westbound plane leaves Shanghai every Tuesday and Friday morning at 6:30 AM, passes through Nanjing at 7:45 AM, passes through Zhengzhou at 10:40 AM, and passes through Xi'an at 11:20 PM (connecting with the Shaanxi-Chengdu route, arriving in Chengdu that day), and arrives in Lanzhou at 4:30 PM. The eastbound plane leaves Lanzhou every Wednesday and Saturday morning at 8:00 AM, passes through Xi'an at 11:00 AM (connecting with the Shaanxi-Chengdu route, with a northbound plane departing from Chengdu at 8:00 AM), passes through Zhengzhou at 1:40 PM, passes through Nanjing at 4:50 PM, and arrives in Shanghai at 6:15 PM. (2) The Beijing-Guangdong route is temporarily open to Zhengzhou. The southbound plane leaves Beijing every Tuesday and Friday morning at 7:00 AM and arrives in Zhengzhou at 10:30 AM. The northbound plane leaves Zhengzhou every Thursday and Sunday morning at 8:00 AM and arrives in Beijing at 11:30 AM. (3) The Lanzhou-Baotou route northbound plane leaves Lanzhou every Tuesday and Saturday morning at 8:00 AM, passes through Ningxia at 10:00 AM, and arrives in Baotou at 12:20 PM. The southbound plane leaves Baotou every Tuesday and Friday at 12:00 PM, passes through Ningxia at 2:00 PM, and arrives in Lanzhou at 4:20 PM. (4) The Shaanxi-Chengdu route southbound plane leaves Xi'an every Tuesday and Friday afternoon at 2:00 PM, passes through Hanzhong at 3:00 PM, and arrives in Chengdu at 5:00 PM. The northbound plane leaves Chengdu every Tuesday and Saturday morning at 8:00 AM, passes through Hanzhong at 9:50 AM, and arrives in Xi'an at 11:00 AM.</p>
<p>Revised Fare: In order to provide preferential treatment to passengers, the company has been charging fares at a 25% discount off the original price for the past two years. The company now finds the procedure of calculating discounted fares to be cumbersome, so it has organized and revised the fares based on the actual 25% discount amount, rounding all odd numbers up to 5 yuan or 10 yuan. The new fare table also took effect yesterday. Although the fares charged are lower than the previous prices, they are slightly higher than the actual discounted fares. The company's business is very prosperous, but the equipment costs are huge, so it cannot avoid losses. After the fares are reorganized, the revenue can also be slightly increased to make up for the losses. Round-trip fares are charged at 90% of the new price. As for the previous statement that the company reduced prices, it is inaccurate.</p>

<p>The postal liaison ship Nagasaki Maru departed from the Huishan Wharf at 9:00 AM yesterday to Japan. All of the ship's passengers had boarded and the ship was starting to weigh anchor, sounding the third whistle in preparation for departure. A coolie on the deck was carrying a passenger's luggage on board, consisting of a box and a basket. However, the luggage was heavier than that of ordinary passengers. In the hurry before departure, the coolie placed the heavy luggage basket down, and suddenly a silver dollar fell out. This was spotted by a customs officer at the dock, who suspected that there was a case of smuggling cash out of the country. He immediately boarded the ship to search it and found 5,000 yuan of cash being secretly smuggled out of the country in the luggage. The silver was seized on the spot and taken to customs. The person who was smuggling the silver was being investigated to be fined.</p>

<p>Continued Allocation of Large Sums to Relieve Disaster: After the severe floods, epidemics are rampant. Shandong Province is the most severely affected by the disaster, and the epidemic is also very serious. The China International Famine Relief Commission has previously allocated 1,000 yuan to the Jinan Presbyterian Hospital to purchase medicines for treatment. In view of the deepening autumn and cold weather, the victims are mostly without food, clothing, and housing, and are plagued by poverty and disease, which is extremely pitiful. It has allocated another 12,000 yuan to Jinan to provide relief. In addition, when the flood first occurred in Huaiqing County, Henan Province, the farmers' belongings were washed away. Now that the water has gradually receded, they have returned to cultivate the land but have nothing. The Commission has allocated another 1,000 yuan to purchase farming tools and seeds for the farmers in the county.</p>
<p>Enthusiastic Assistance from All Sectors: The Chinatown of Winterley, Canada, has previously raised a large sum of money and remitted it to the Fundraising Department of the China International Famine Relief Commission to help the victims of the Jianghe floods. Now, it has remitted another 200 yuan to the Commission for distribution. In addition, the Batavia Relief Association has donated 10,000 yuan, which the Commission has received and transferred to the disaster area. Chinese living in other cities have also sent letters and telegrams to the Commission, stating that they are working hard to raise money. In addition, institutions and individuals in this city, such as St. Mary's Girls' High School, Qingxin High School, have also donated large sums of money. It shows the sympathy of all people.</p>

<h3 id="e122">The Tragic Bloodshed Involving Housewife and Maid – Suspect Luo Yusheng and Luo Yefu Arrested – Blood Stains Found Inside the Hem of Luo's Western-Style Trousers – Two Boxes of Valuables Stored at a Friend's House – Luo Initially Confessed to the Murder During Interrogation but Completely Denied It During Court Trial Yesterday Morning <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>Mrs. Jin Dai, a woman from Jinhua, Zhejiang Province (also known as Jin Baozhen), residing at 459, third floor, Erjin Road, North Henan Road, and her maid, Luo, were suddenly attacked by an intruder around 8 AM on the 23rd of this month. Both women were fatally wounded with axes. Hua Detective Shang Wu, Detectives Zhao Qingkui and Bao Langchun from the Huishi Police Department, and Western Detective Shamboro, apprehended Luo Yusheng, a native of Yiwu, Zhejiang (age 21, residing at 31 Xinqiao Road, Nanshi), as the suspect in the case.</p>
<p>(Currently serving as the Director of Studies at Mingchen Elementary School and also the son of lawyer Luo Zhaoxin, who was fatally shot on Guangdong Road, Qinghefang, on June 19th of last year.) He was taken into custody at the police station and escorted to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special District Court yesterday morning at 9:30 AM. Judge Liu Yugui presided over the interrogation, and the defendant, Luo Yusheng, was represented by lawyer Lou Yunmei. The trial lasted approximately three hours. Due to the need for further investigation in the case, the trial was postponed for seven days for further review. A detailed account of the</p>
<p>Trial Proceedings is as follows: First, Police Barrister Zhang Tianyin stated that the police department is prosecuting the defendant Luo Yusheng for murder under Article 271 of the criminal law. At 10:40 AM on the 23rd of this month, the police department received a phone report stating that two women had been murdered at 459, third floor, North Henan Road. The police department immediately dispatched an ambulance and rushed the injured to Shanghai Sanitarium on Lao Bazi Road. However, Jin Dai passed away due to her serious injuries before arriving at the hospital.</p>
<p>The maid, Luo, suffered four axe wounds to the face and two to the head, and her injuries were also severe. She died at the hospital at 2:30 PM that afternoon, and her body was sent to the coroner's office for examination. After the inspection by the prosecutor's office of the court, the police department dispatched Chinese and Western detectives to the scene to conduct a detailed investigation. They found Jin Dai lying on the sofa in the front room and Luo lying on the floor, both covered in blood. There was a significant amount of blood on the floor. Next to Luo's body, they found</p>
<p>an Axe. Another axe was found under the bed in the back room. At that time, Jin Yongren, son of the deceased Jin Dai, and her daughter, Jin Lingyi, reported to the detectives that important items that their mother had kept in the bedside cabinet, such as the passbook with the Tongyuan Bank's Jin Ji account name, etc., were missing. In addition to finding a tram ticket of 12 points next to the cabinet, the detectives also learned that Jin had a safety deposit box at the Shanghai Bank. Therefore, based on</p>
<p>this clue, they rushed to the Shanghai Bank to investigate. However, in order to comply with banking practices, the bank refused to disclose the contents of the safe deposit box, only stating that a person had recently come with a key to open the box and described the person's age, appearance, and clothing. Upon hearing this, the deceased's daughter, Jin Lingyi, immediately declared to the detectives that, based on the person's age and accent, it was Luo Yusheng, her fellow townsman who worked as a teacher at Mingchen Elementary School. The detectives, together with police detectives from the Public Security Bureau, went to Mingchen Elementary School at 31 Xinqiao Road, Nanshi, to arrest the defendant. They found 100 yuan in banknotes and 17 yuan in small change in his suitcase, as well as a pair of western-style trousers. The trousers appeared to have been recently washed but were not yet dry, and the inside of the trouser legs had</p>
<p>a lot of blood stains. He was then taken to the Public Security Bureau and brought back to the police station at 10:40 AM yesterday morning for questioning. At first, he denied everything. Later, Wang Mingrong, residing at 14 Jiu'an Lane, Huangjiaque Road, Nanshi, saw the news of Luo Yusheng's arrest in the newspaper and suddenly remembered that Luo had left two leather suitcases at Wang's place on the morning of the 23rd. In order to disassociate himself, Wang sent the two leather suitcases left by Luo to the Municipal Public Security Bureau. Upon opening the suitcases, they were found to contain valuable items and</p>
<p>Jin Lingyi's seals, and three of her personal seals. Upon receiving this information, Chief Detective Shang led Jin Lingyi to identify the items in the suitcases. All the items were confirmed to belong to her mother. The two suitcases are currently stored at the Public Security Bureau. Chief Detective Shang then interrogated the defendant severely. The defendant finally confessed the truth, stating that his father, Luo Zhaoxin, was a lawyer in Ningbo and had a close relationship with Jin Zhaozong, the former Chief Prosecutor of the Ningbo District Court (the deceased's husband). Later, Luo Zhaoxin was</p>
<p>shot and killed in Qinghefang, Shanghai, last year. Jin Dai was in charge of a lot of money and property. The defendant, unable to obtain anything, harbored resentment and sought revenge. On August of this year, after the defendant took over Mingchen Elementary School, lawyer Lou Yunmei, who is now defending the defendant, introduced Xu Wenxian to the school as a tea server. The defendant then conspired with Xu to plan the revenge. Xu invited a Mr. Ma, and at 7:00 AM on the 23rd, the defendant took the Route 6 tram in the French Concession and then transferred to the Route 14</p>
<p>Trolleybus, arriving directly at the intersection of North Henan Road and Lao Bazi Road. At that time, Xu and Ma were already waiting at the station with axes. After meeting, they waited around because it was still early and Jin Dai's children had not yet gone to school. Around 8:00 AM, the defendant led them to Jin's house. The defendant stood guard downstairs while Xu and Ma went upstairs with axes. Shortly after, Xu and the others came downstairs, saying that the matter had been settled. The defendant then went upstairs, opened the bedside cabinet, took out the bank passbook and the safety deposit box key, and returned to school by tram.</p>
<p>In his haste, he left a tram ticket upstairs in the deceased's house. Later, Xu also returned to school and told the defendant that he had been given a reward of 50 yuan. He also claimed that he had stolen the Shanghai Bank safe deposit box key before going upstairs, secretly carved a seal, went to the Shanghai Bank to open the box, and obtained a lot of property. He packed it together with the items taken from Jin's house that day into two suitcases and transported them to the house he had rented on Huangjiaque Road (monthly rent of 12 yuan), etc. After obtaining the confession, the detectives took the defendant to the</p>
<p>Scene of the crime to demonstrate what happened at the time. Currently, this case is requesting a postponement in order to apprehend the accomplices. Furthermore, the blood stains on the western-style trousers seized from the defendant's school are currently being analyzed by the Chemistry Department of the Public Works Bureau to determine if they are the same as the deceased's blood. Also, two official letters are requested, one to the Shanghai Bank, ordering them to fully explain the contents of Jin Dai's safety deposit box to the police department for reference, and one to the Public Security Bureau, requesting that</p>
<p>the two suitcases be transferred for investigation, etc. Then, the axe and the photographs taken at the scene were presented as evidence. Subsequently, Jin Yongren, son of Jin Dai, testified that he was a student at Huatong Public School, 16 years old, and knew the defendant. During the summer vacation last year, because the defendant's father, Luo Zhaoxin, was assassinated, the defendant and his mother temporarily resided at my house for about a month. At 10:30 AM this morning, I received a report at school and returned home, finding two axes and the bedside cabinet under the bed opened, with</p>
<p>the stolen belongings. Also, the gold and diamond rings that my mother wore on her hands had been removed. Jin Lingyi also testified that she was 18 years old and a student at Xiaoming Girls' School. Three days before the incident, the defendant came and took away a leather suitcase and a radio that he had stored at our house. The radio is currently being held at the Public Security Bureau. Witness Cai Xingbao testified that he worked as a tea server at the Zhiyin Music Association downstairs at 459 North Henan Road. Around 10:00 AM on the morning of the incident, he was ordered by Wang Hefeng, a staff member of the store, to take</p>
<p>photographs upstairs, preparing them for Mrs. Jin (the deceased) to review. As soon as he reached the staircase, he suddenly heard Luo's groans. Suspecting she had suffered a fit, he went downstairs and returned with others, forcing the door open and discovering that the two women had been killed. He then reported to the police department. When questioned, the defendant Luo Yusheng testified that his father, Luo Zhaoxin, and the Jin family knew each other and were old acquaintances. Last year, after my father was tried, I lived at Aunt Jin's house for about a year. I only knew that</p>
<p>my father had two checks, each for 250 yuan, deposited in a Hangzhou bank more than ten years ago. Up to now, I can withdraw 1,000 yuan, which Aunt Jin took away. Although I asked for it, she delayed payment. I have no grievances against Aunt Jin and had no intention of harming her. Not only is there no tea server named Xu Wenxian in my school, but at 7:30 AM on the 13th, I was in the office with female teacher Xu Manqian and others revising the syllabus. At 8:00 AM, I was the master of ceremonies for the memorial week. This point</p>
<p>can be proven by the teachers and students in the school. As for the confession I made in the police station yesterday, it was a forced and nonsensical confession. The 100 yuan in banknotes found was borrowed from my friend Wang Zhiqing, totaling 300 yuan. After spending 200 yuan, there was still 100 yuan left, hidden in the suitcase. As for the Shanghai Bank safety deposit box number 174, it is in my own name and not Jin Dai's. At 1:30 PM on the 23rd, I went to the bank to open the box and retrieve items, including the Mainland and Shanghai</p>
<p>Bank passbooks and my parents' death certificates, our family's gold rings, etc. The house on Wang Mingrong's house on Huangjiaque Road was originally rented by me, with a monthly rent of 12 yuan, but it has now been subleased and all the items have been completely moved away, leaving only an empty house. I did not leave two leather suitcases at Wang Mingrong's place. This point can be confirmed by summoning the second landlord, Wang Mingrong, to identify whether it was me who sent them or someone else, etc. Finally,</p>
<p>the witness invited by the defendant, Xu Manqian, a female teacher, testified that she was a teacher at Mingchen Elementary School. On the morning of the incident, I was with the defendant in school opening the memorial week. He did not go out in the morning. However, regarding the defendant's testimony about the memorial week report and syllabus revision, the testimony was contradictory. Judge Liu Yu concluded the interrogation at this point, as it was already past noon, and ordered the defendant to be detained for seven days for further interrogation.</p>
<h3 id="e123">Yong'an Silver Company Case - Shen Zufuh and Others Summoned Yesterday - Yong'an Resumed Business for One Day with Shen as Manager - The Case Has Been Concluded and the Verdict Will Be Announced on the 30th <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>The case of the Yong'an Silver Company's fraudulent scheme that defrauded depositors of a large sum of money will soon reach its one-year anniversary. The case has been delayed because the responsible parties of the company have repeatedly evaded justice. So far, only the board member Lin Kanghou and board member and general manager Ou Jiancheng have been sentenced by the First Special District Court. Although the other defendants have been summoned or detained by the court, they have not been brought to justice, causing the entire case to be prolonged and difficult to resolve. Yesterday afternoon, Shen Zufuh, a native of Shaoxing and the newly appointed manager who resumed business for one day, and Dai Kechang, the manager of the Xiafei Road branch, were summoned for continued interrogation. Judge Xiao Xiefen presided over the hearing. It was investigated that the depositors of the company filed a criminal lawsuit for fraud and listed Shen and Dai as defendants. The depositors included Chen Zhongru, Zhou Shoufu, Cao Zhu, Xie Zhongying, Chen Shengyao, Gao Yiqun, Qiu Bokai, etc. The lawyers representing the plaintiffs successively stated the types of deposits and the amounts deposited. Chen Zhongru's lawyer, Lu Shaozong, solemnly stated that the 4,000 yuan deposited by Chen was completely sacrificed by Shen Zufuh. Chen only knew Shen. Shen took office as manager and asked Chen for help. Chen only deposited the money on the day of resumption. This type of deposit was called "hanging red" and was originally intended to be deposited in the morning and withdrawn in the evening, but it was eventually embezzled. Isn't this fraud, etc.? When questioned, the defendant Shen Zufuh stated that when the company first suspended business, it owed 220,000 yuan and also owed 180,000 yuan to others. Later, the board of directors decided that more than 100,000 yuan in receivables were available, so they hired me to be the manager after the resumption of business. However, on the day of resumption, the company only handed me over 20,000 yuan. The income on that day was more than 80,000 yuan, while the expenditure was more than 110,000 yuan, so it was still impossible to maintain and it suspended business again like a flash in the pan, etc. He also denied asking the plaintiff to "hang red" with the money. The court found it difficult to believe Shen's statement that he was not a shareholder of the company and was hired by the board of directors to be the manager, only responsible for business operations, etc. Therefore, they investigated what exchange conditions there were for him to serve as manager and how much he admitted to advancing. However, Shen firmly stated that he was not responsible for raising funds. Then, he stated that the company knew that he came from the banking industry and hoped that he could interact with the banking industry, so they borrowed his expertise, etc. Next, the defendant Dai Kechang stated that he used to work at the Navy Club. Ou Jiancheng knew that he had extensive social connections and an excellent reputation, so he specifically used the position of manager of the Xiafei Road branch to recruit him. Old classmates and colleagues heard that he was there and came to deposit money, about 30,000 yuan in total. The company handed over the money to the head office every day and never kept any. Unexpectedly, only nine days after taking office, the branch suspended business with the head office, so he was also a victim, etc. Then, the debate began. First, the lawyers for the plaintiffs spoke in turn. Those who included Shen and Dai in the lawsuit believed that Shen should be held responsible for fraud, saying that the company's board of directors also had a resolution that the responsibility for the second suspension should be borne by Shen. As for Dai, they requested the court to investigate and handle the case. Those whose lawsuits did not include Shen and Dai stated that the other defendants, such as Ye Hancheng and Qian Youju, could not be arrested, so they requested that the part of the case be stopped, so that it could be concluded. Finally, under the defense of the defendant's lawyer, Judge Xiao ordered Shen Zufuh to pay a bail of 3,000 yuan and wait for the verdict on September 30.</p>
<h3 id="e124">Fish Merchant Weng Zhaofang and Others Accused of Evading National Taxes - Conspiracy to Defraud during the Weighing of 50,000 Piculs of Russian Salmon - Zhu Xusheng and Others Who Conspired Confessed and Reported the Crime <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>Last winter, some people in the salted fish industry purchased 50,000 piculs of salmon from the Soviet Union Association Foreign Firm. During the weighing at the wharf, they defrauded a huge amount of 6,700 piculs, worth more than 70,000 yuan. Now, Zhu Xusheng, Chang Junfa, Zhao Lianfang and other three accomplices, considering that theft is a minor matter, but the harm to tax revenue is not insignificant, and fearing that once the incident is exposed, they will definitely be suspected as accomplices, confessed to the Municipal Public Security Bureau on July 14. They requested that it be transferred to the prosecutor's office of the District Court for investigation in accordance with the law. It is now learned that this case has been concluded after several interrogations by Prosecutor Xiao Jinying. He ordered the defendants Zhu Xusheng, Chang Junfa, Zhao Lianfang, Weng Zhaofang, Ye Zhenchang, Zheng Yunsheng, etc. to be released on bail and filed a public prosecution. Regarding the facts of the crime, the defendants Weng Zhaofang, Ye Zhenchang, and Zheng Yunsheng all opened fish shops. Last year, they purchased from the Soviet Union Association Foreign Firm. On January 6th of this year, Zhao Lianfang and the shipping clerks Ye Zhenqin and Zhang Benhua, etc., raised the carrying pole during the weighing of the fish boxes at the Yangjiadu Wharf to reduce the quantity. It is estimated that three ships in total obtained 6,700 piculs of fish, worth more than 70,000 yuan. Later, Zhu Xusheng and others divided the profits too little and informed the Municipal Public Security Bureau, which sent a letter to investigate. (Evidence and legal articles violated) The defendants jointly defrauded the Russian merchant of the salmon. According to the interrogation, Zhu Xusheng, Chang Junfa, and Zhao Lianfang described in detail how they planned to defraud. The evidence of the crime is extremely clear. They are accomplices in Article 339, paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law and should be prosecuted in accordance with the law, etc. Yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, Judge Wu Deying specially opened the Third Court for trial. The defendants hired four lawyers, Zhang Shizhao, Zhu Yakui, Dai Ningrui, and Peng Yuanxun, to appear in court to defend them. First, Zhu Xusheng testified that last year, he purchased salmon from the Russian Assistance Association Foreign Firm through the Zhenda Foreign Firm. Because I was unemployed, Ye Zhenchang, the manager of Zhenda Foreign Firm, asked me to help when the goods arrived and told me to call the coolies. I helped greet the worker Chang Junfa and ordered me to cheat and tell the coolies not to put the fish box too firmly on the scale when weighing the fish. The rope was not completely loosened, so that the weight could be reduced. There were three ships in total. The first batch was on November 13th, totaling 37,743 boxes. The second batch was on December 23rd, totaling 43,136 boxes. The third batch was on January 6th of this year, totaling 8,129 boxes. Zhang Benhua is the shipping clerk of Zhenda. Ye Zhenchang promised to give us 20% of the profits from the fraud, but he only gave me 120 yuan. According to our calculations, the fraud amounted to more than 70,000 yuan. But I was not the only one working on the job. The people working on the scene often negotiated with me. The officer said, do you think you are getting too little, so you confessed? I replied, no, it's because I'm now repenting. The officer said, do you know you are breaking the law? I replied, I know. Because this is evading national taxes, I repent and reported it, hoping that the penalty will be reduced, etc. Next, Chang Junfa testified that he was a coolie foreman. Zhao Lianfang testified that he was a shipping clerk. The rest of the testimony was largely the same as that of Zhu Xusheng. Then, Zheng Yunsheng, Weng Zhaofang, Ye Zhenchang, Zhang Benhua, and Ye Zhenqin all testified that they denied any fraudulent activities, vaguely saying that when weighing at the wharf, there were four or five people including the impartial person, the cargo owner, and the ship escort on the scene to inspect. How could they cheat, asking for a clear understanding? The interrogating officer obtained the testimony and thought it was too late and the witnesses were not complete, so he decided not to open the debate and wait for a joint trial at a later date.</p>

<p>In order to encourage competition among the teams and attendance of each class, the International Chamber of Commerce has a "Proficiency Silver Shield" for the total team score, and the competition is held annually to observe the level of achievement of each team in the past year and determine who the shield belongs to. Therefore, over the years, each team in the group has not given way to the competition for the Proficiency Shield. Winning this round and being crowned the champion for a year is not only the champion of the group, but also an unparalleled international honor. It is now learned that the results of the last session have been announced. After a comprehensive review of the results, the Chinese team ranked first in the entire group, so the shield should belong to them. According to the Chinese team, when Hu Yunqiu and Wang Yanqing were the team leaders, they won the shield three times. Since Chen Shixia took over as the team leader, they have won three consecutive times in the past three years. This is truly a great event. The spirit of cooperation and striving for national glory can be imagined. The Chinese people are also pleased about this. It is also reported that the team is currently recruiting new members. Those who are interested in joining can register at the team headquarters at 132 Hankou Road, third floor, Su Zhang.</p>
<h3 id="e128">Incident of Shi Jiurong's Abduction: One Abductor Apprehended, Interrogation Postponed Awaiting Capture of Accomplices; Zhang Xiaosan Admits to Abduction Without Reservation <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>Shi Jiurong, a 32-year-old Ningbo native residing at 275 Yu Yuan Road, formerly studied mechanical engineering at the University of Michigan in the United States. After graduating, he returned to China and served as the head of the sales department at Meitong Automobile Company at 615 Avenue Foch. He used his own Buick car, license plate number 946, for transportation and employed Li Alin from Yangzhou as his chauffeur. On April 18th of this year, at 9:00 AM, Shi took his car from his residence to the Meitong Automobile Company to work. As the car arrived in front of the Meitong Automobile Company on Avenue Foch and Shi was about to get out, four kidnappers suddenly emerged from the roadside with guns. Two of the kidnappers opened the left and right rear doors of Shi's car, sat to Shi's left and right. The other two kidnappers entered the front of Shi's car, sitting next to the chauffeur and monitoring Li Alin with guns, ordering him to drive away. Li, being alert, secretly disabled the car's engine while pretending to step on the accelerator. In this critical moment, a Russian mechanic from Meitong Automobile Company happened to look up and saw Shi sitting in the car with people monitoring him, realizing something was wrong. He shouted "Robbers!" At the same time, an Indian policeman stationed there by the Public Concession to manage traffic lights also noticed the situation and rushed to Shi's car. As he inquired, the kidnappers opened fire from the car, and a bullet grazed the Indian policeman's leg. Realizing that their plan had failed, the kidnappers quickly forced Shi out of the car and fled in different directions. One kidnapper fled towards Route MAssenet, turned into Route Cardinal Mercier, and fled west and east. A Chinese constable, number 242, from the Public Concession heard the alarm and rushed to help chase after the fleeing kidnappers. The kidnapper fleeing east opened fire to resist arrest upon seeing the pursuing constable. The constable returned fire, hitting the kidnapper in the chest. The kidnapper collapsed on the side of Route Cardinal Mercier opposite number 647, dying instantly. A pistol and several bullets were found on the body. The kidnapper fleeing west also disappeared. The other two kidnappers fled west along Avenue Foch. A Western constable, McKieber, from the Jing'an Temple Police Station, happened to be patrolling on a bicycle and pursued them. The two kidnappers also opened fire to resist arrest but ultimately escaped without a trace. Afterwards, the French Concession Police Department sent detectives to take the dead robber's body to the mortuary for examination. They reported the case to the Second Special District Court, which sent officials to investigate. The body was then buried by a charitable organization. Meanwhile, the French Police Department ordered detectives to thoroughly investigate and arrest the remaining robbers. These details were reported in previous newspapers. Recently, Jin Jiulin, the Inspector General of the French Police Department, received confidential information that Zhang Xiaosan, a native of Jiangbei and an accomplice in the abduction case, was hiding on Lujiabang Road in the southern part of the city, and would pass by Rue Amiral Bayle and Route Pere Huc every morning. Inspector General Jin dispatched detectives Zhang Ziying and Zhou Buguang, along with detectives Dai Rongji, Zhu Ju, Jin Bingwen, and others, to patrol and arrest him on Rue Amiral Bayle and Route Pere Huc. After several days, at around 8:00 AM on the 24th, the informant spotted the kidnapper Zhang Xiaosan walking hurriedly north from the South Bund. The detectives swarmed forward, arrested him, and took him to the police station for interrogation. According to Zhang's confession, he admitted to conspiring to abduct Shi Jiurong, and stated that a certain person, currently at large, was the mastermind. He also identified the accomplice who was shot and killed by the police as Tian Dazhong. He was immediately ordered to be detained, and the police began to track down the remaining accomplices based on his confession. Yesterday, the police sent the robber Zhang to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court. Judge Wang Gangxu presided over the hearing. Yao Zhaodi, a lawyer from the Police Department, presented the case, stating that the investigation would take time and that the remaining accomplices needed to be arrested, requesting a postponement of the hearing. Detective Dai Rongji then reported the circumstances of the arrest of the defendant and the incident. The court verified the report and questioned the defendant, whose confession was consistent with the one given at the police station. The court then approved the postponement, ordering a reinvestigation and returning the defendant to custody.</p>
<h3 id="e129">Following Fei Keming's Death, Estate Disputes Abound, Obstructing Funeral Arrangements, Litigation Ceases Briefly, Physical Assaults and Verbal Abuse Recommence, A Tragic Family Feud <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>Fei Keming, a local resident who made his fortune in real estate and accumulated assets of two to three hundred thousand yuan, passed away on the 4th of last month at his residence at 70, Lane 741, Dongyouheng Road, Hongkou. His four sons, Yusheng, Junwen, Bingwen, and Meiwen, and his daughters, Guijin and Meijin, engaged in a fierce dispute over the inheritance during the funeral. The second son, Junwen, believing that the eldest brother, Yusheng, was monopolizing the funeral arrangements and excluding the other siblings from participation, used a self-defense pistol to prevent the dotting of the ancestral tablet and seized the tablet, causing Yusheng embarrassment. Yusheng reported the incident to the police, initiating a public prosecution against Junwen for obstructing the funeral. Subsequently, the First Special District Court concluded the hearing and sentenced Junwen to two months of imprisonment with a one-year suspended sentence, as reported previously. However, the Fei brothers' grievances deepened daily, and the internal strife intensified. Now, the brotherly conflict has evolved into a dispute involving their wives. Junwen, having lost the lawsuit previously, his wife, Huang, often provoked Yusheng and Meiwen, Yusheng's younger uncle. At 12:30 PM on the 7th of this month, the two sides engaged in another violent clash, a tragic scene of family infighting, at the old residence at 70 Dongyouheng Road. During the incident, chairs were overturned, crying and cursing filled the air. When it ended, Fei Huang's body was injured, prompting her to rush to the Huishan Police Station, reporting that Yusheng struck her chest with a table and Yusheng's son, Qigang, and Meiwen's wife, Yang, assisted in the assault, fiercely punching and kicking her. The police chief ordered a hospital examination, confirming the presence of injuries, leading to a public prosecution based on Article 277 of the criminal code. Yesterday morning, Judge Dai Rongduo of the First Special Court convened a hearing, summoning the defendants Fei Qigang, 19 years old, and Fei Yang, only 18 years old, who were accompanied by Fei Yusheng. They invited relatives Fei Musheng, Fei Yao, Zhou Guansheng, Song Zuying, and others to court, intending to prove the falsity of Huang's accusations. Fei Huang was also accompanied by her father, Huang Dayi, and her husband's brothers Bingwen, Guijin, Meijin, and Zhou Asan, to provide testimony. After the prosecuting attorney, Qian Xunjiu, from the police station briefly outlined the case, stating that both sides had four or five witnesses and that the details were complex and required careful examination, he requested another hearing date for a detailed investigation. The court briefly questioned the parties involved. Fei Huang testified that her injuries were caused by her eldest brother-in-law and his children assaulting her and striking her with a table. However, Fei Yusheng vehemently denied the accusations, claiming that the plaintiff injured herself with the table, intentionally framing him. Judge Dai, noting that the testimonies of the two sides were contradictory and that there were numerous witnesses, requiring a longer period of investigation, ordered both parties to await notification of a rescheduled hearing. It is rumored that Fei Yusheng will also file a lawsuit against Fei Huang, the feud is still escalating. If Fei Keming knew, he would never rest in peace.</p>

<h3 id="e130">Renji Hospital, Struggling for 91 Years, Faces Economic Difficulties Due to Economic Recession, Revenue Decreases, Deficit of Over 13,000 Yuan Last Year, Outpatient Visits Surge, Reaching 200,000 Annually <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>Renji Hospital on Shandong Road has been serving the community since the 26th year of the Daoguang reign of the Qing Dynasty (1846 AD). Its location is in McTaggart Road, with a history of 91 years. The hospital buildings have been rebuilt and expanded several times, but the location has remained the same, so those who have lived in Shanghai for a long time are familiar with "Renji Hospital in McTaggart Road". The hospital has been expanded over the years to meet the needs of the environment. Most of the funding has come from donations from enthusiastic individuals, but due to the large expenses, it has been difficult to make ends meet. Only after Henry Lester, the owner of the former Dehe Foreign Firm, provided substantial funding, was it possible to have the magnificent building standing on the south side of Shandong Road and Fuzhou Road today. From the surface, it seems that the sufficiency of its funding can be represented by this large building, but in reality, this is not entirely the case. Its need for funds is actually beyond our expectations. Since Shanghai has been shrouded in the gloomy atmosphere of economic recession, all industries have been in decline, which has had a major impact on the livelihood of society. Even if middle- and lower-class families try their best to reduce their daily needs, they still cannot make ends meet. Not to mention those who have unfortunately lost their jobs. Therefore, on the one hand, Renji Hospital is short of resources and its income has decreased, and on the other hand, demand exceeds supply, and its expenditures have increased. This phenomenon is very obvious due to the exhaustion of the social economy. In the past, middle-class families could afford a doctor, but now, due to difficult living conditions, they have no choice but to seek help from public hospitals. As for the poor and working classes, who rely on charitable hospitals for their livelihoods, their numbers have naturally increased. For this reason, the hospital is crowded with patients, and the authorities feel that they have no rice to cook. Last year, Renji Hospital had a deficit of more than 23,000 yuan in addition to various subsidies, donations, and medical expenses. The hospital, in view of the economic difficulties, has tried its best to reduce all expenses, such as the salaries of staff and workers, but the deficit still reached this number. What the hospital hopes for today is the enthusiastic donation of people from all walks of life, who are happy to donate. This is not only the beauty of feeling the pain of others and helping them, but also to create benefits for society and maintain the safety and order of the public. This principle may not be understood by the general public, especially those in the "upper class" who live in peace and comfort, and who have not paid attention to the hospitals that the working class regards as a guarantee of health, let alone pay attention to them. In fact, the occurrence of diseases, the suffering of the individual, is a small matter. If we look at it from the perspective of the family and the entire society, the impact cannot be ignored. But this is only in terms of the near-term cause and the long-term effect. Other examples, such as infectious diseases and epidemics that directly affect the public, people of the lower classes, due to their lack of knowledge and simple living conditions, are unable to prevent them in advance. It is a tragic event when they are ill and have no way to seek help and are waiting to die. Renji Hospital treats hundreds of thousands of patients every year, reducing personal suffering, curbing the spread of diseases to society, and increasing the health and happiness of people. Its contribution is truly undeniable. Let us close our eyes and think about it. Shanghai has many good doctors and hospitals with perfect equipment, but they are only for the consultation of a few people. The expensive medical expenses are as different from the copper coins of fifteen yuan charged by Renji Hospital as heaven and earth. The consultation fee of a noble person once can directly cover the outpatient expenses of hundreds of people here. But fortunately, there is this hospital, otherwise, where would these hundreds of thousands of patients go if they only had five cents of ocean? The number of daily outpatient visits to Renji Hospital is between 600 and 900. The so-called consultation fee of fifteen copper coins is only for a small number of people. Most of the patients cannot even afford the meager fifteen copper coins. Everything from diagnosis to medicine is free, which can be said to be the greatest benefit to the poor. The number of inpatients has also increased sharply recently. Due to the limited number of beds, it has not been possible to accommodate as many as possible. Ordinary patients pay six cents of ocean a day, including all food, lodging, and medical expenses, but one-third of them do not pay anything. According to people in the hospital, this six cents of ocean is only one-fifth of the total cost per patient per day. The cost of medicines is even lower. A prescription that usually costs 2.50 yuan at a pharmacy in the market only costs 25 cents of ocean in the hospital. This is just a very small example. As for the cost of abdominal surgery and other fees, which a wife cannot afford in her lifetime, the hospital performs the operation for the patient according to the needs of the patient, and charges a small fee according to the patient's ability, or waives the fee entirely for those who are extremely poor. The treatment of emergency patients, such as gunshot wounds, accidental injuries, and suicide by poisoning, is the most burdensome for Renji Hospital in the central district of the Public Concession. The efficiency of its services is also highly praised by the public. According to past statistics of the hospital, on average, every hour of the 24 hours of the day, there is an emergency patient seeking treatment, among which the number of those who commit suicide by taking poison is the most numerous. Suicide is a sin. Although the reasons are different, it is a pity that they resorted to this strategy. The physical pain is only a momentary thing for the person who commits suicide. They often muster their foolish courage to do so. As for the spiritual trauma, it cannot be expressed in physical terms. It has been seen that the hospital often earnestly exhorts those who have been saved from suicide after they have been reborn, to follow the path of happiness and destiny. This is based on the Christian spirit of saving the world, and to hope that all beings will ascend to heaven together. Renji Hospital has spacious buildings, complete equipment, quietness in the bustling city, and a not-so-bad environment. It can be called the crown of hospitals in the bustling city. The patient rooms have windows on three sides, good ventilation, and good light. There are five operating rooms, four of which are in constant use, and one is reserved for emergencies. All the equipment in them is of the latest type. The shadowless lamp on the operating table is one of its characteristics. The kitchen is located on the top of the building, using both gas and steam to prepare meals for 400 people. After the meals are cooked, they are sent to each ward by two special elevators. The completeness of its equipment is no less than that of major hospitals in Europe and the United States. The hospital has an affiliated nursing training school, which has trained a large number of nursing talents over the years. When the last graduation ceremony was held, Li Tingan, the director of the Municipal Health Bureau, and his wife personally attended the ceremony and gave words of encouragement. The current president is Dr. Patterson, and the vice president is Dr. Ferguson, who have both served in the hospital for many years. There are currently 13 foreign staff members, including six foreign female nurses. There are a total of 242 Chinese staff members, from chief physicians to nurses and workers. There are also eight physicians who work at the Lester Institute of Pathology. There is an even larger number of honorary consulting physicians outside the hospital. Renji Hospital has the largest number of outpatient visits. Seven years ago, the number was about 90,000 per year. Last year, the number of patients increased sharply to more than 183,000. Although this year has not yet reached the end of the year, it is estimated that the number will not be less than 200,000. These 200,000 outpatient visits account for almost 7% of the total population of Shanghai. It cannot be said to be a small number.</p>
<h3 id="e131">New Beijing Ship Suicide Incident on the Tongsha Ocean Surface: Young Man and Woman Jump into the Sea, Man Appears to Be Upper Class, Woman's Dress Also Modern, Jump into the Sea Together on the Outer Tongsha Ocean Surface, Male Passenger Claims to Be Wang from Shandong, Had a Sumptuous Meal Before Death <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>Datong News Agency reports that the Taikoo Company's New Beijing ship, which departed from Shanghai for Ningbo on the 23rd, had two young male and female passengers in the 19th cabin jump into the sea to commit suicide while the ship was passing through the Outer Tongsha Ocean surface. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Passengers in the First-Class Cabin: The New Beijing ship departed from Shanghai for Ningbo at 5:00 PM on the 23rd. In cabin number 19 of the ship, there were two young male and female passengers. The man was about 20 years old, wearing a light gray suit. The woman was 22 years old, wearing a light green cheongsam with a white wool scarf around her neck, permed hair, and wearing openwork leather shoes. Cui Dechang, the steward of the cabin, noticed that the two passengers appeared to be upper class, so he served them diligently.</p>
<p>The Deceased Had a Sumptuous Meal: At about 6:00 PM that evening, the ship left the Wusong estuary, and dinner was served on the ship. Steward Cui Dechang brought in the dinner. At that time, both the man and woman had a sumptuous meal. After the meal, the two passengers took out purple grapes and candied peanuts that they had brought with them and ate them casually. At that time, the two were joking and laughing, and their relationship was very close, with no signs of world-weariness. At about 8:45 PM, the ship passed through the Outer Tongsha Ocean surface. The two passengers suddenly took off their leather shoes and changed into the straw slippers provided on the ship, saying that they were going to admire the night view of the sea on the deck.</p>
<p>Jumping into the Sea on the Outer Tongsha Ocean Surface: At that time, steward Cui Dechang, seeing that it was already late at night, told them to go to bed early, and the two passengers casually agreed. Before ten minutes had passed, someone suddenly shouted that someone had jumped into the sea on the aft deck. Steward Cui Dechang heard the shout and ran to the aft deck to check. Only the slippers that the two passengers were wearing were left on the stern of the ship, and the people were missing, obviously having jumped into the sea to commit suicide. He immediately reported to the captain to stop the ship and try to rescue them, but the Outer Tongsha Ocean surface was extremely vast, and there were waves at the time, so it was impossible to rescue them.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of the Remains: Afterwards, steward Cui Dechang checked the remains and found only the man's suit jacket, a pair of leather shoes, and the woman's pair of openwork leather shoes. There were no letters or other items. The above items have been kept by the steward and are awaiting the arrival of family members to claim them. The Datong News Agency reporter interviewed the steward Cui yesterday. According to him, the man told him during dinner that evening that he was from Shandong, surnamed Wang, and pointed to the woman and said that she was his wife. However, observing the intimate behavior of the man and woman, he was afraid that they were not officially married.</p>
<h3 id="e132">Liu Zigu's Painting Exhibition Organized by the Social Education Bureau and the Education Bureau Opened Yesterday, Wu Xingya Personally Presided Over It <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>In order to promote national painting, the Municipal Social Education Bureau and the Education Bureau jointly organized a national painting exhibition of the famous painter Mr. Liu Zigu at the Continental Commercial Building on the sixth floor, displaying more than 300 pieces of Liu's exquisite masterpieces. The details have been reported in the previous newspapers. Yesterday was the opening day, and no less than a thousand people attended the exhibition. The details of the various situations are recorded below:</p>
<p>Director Wu Personally Presided Over: This painting exhibition was originally intended to promote art, and it was also advocated by the Social Education Bureau and the Education Bureau, so the bureau and others sent personnel to take care of the venue. The Education Bureau sent Ding Shoutang and Shi Chongpeng, and the Social Bureau sent Zhang Binghui, Chen Binhua, etc. In addition, Director Wu also personally came to the venue to instruct everything.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of the Contents of the Works: All the more than 300 works are divided into two rooms for display. There are landscapes, figures, ladies, flowers, birds, orchids, and bamboos. Among them, landscapes are the most numerous. The most eye-catching ones are the Refugee Map, the Flood Map, the Mulan Joining the Army Map, and the "I Love Beauty, Not the Country" Map, which are either current events, historical facts, or allegorical, and are very valuable. Other imitations of ancient works are also very similar and can be mistaken for the real thing. The figures include the national hero Qi Jiguang's portrait, ladies such as "Qinxin Youyou", flowers and birds such as "Spring River Water Warm", and orchids and bamboos such as "Snow Bamboo, Who Does the Fragrance Reveal", which are all enough to amaze people and sigh with admiration.</p>
<p>Crowded Attendance From All Walks of Life: Yesterday was the first day of the exhibition, and the attendance from all walks of life was quite crowded, especially from the literary and art circles and the press. The total number of visitors was no less than a thousand people, and some even placed orders with the exhibition.</p>
<h3 id="e133">Report on the Closure of the Hongkou Plague Hospital <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>The Hongkou Plague Hospital, located at the north end of Xiangyanqiao, Yucai Road, Hongkou, has been open for diagnosis and treatment since July 10th, reaching two and a half months. The results have been very good. Now that autumn has arrived and the plague is gradually subsiding, the hospital will cease outpatient services on the 25th of this month. According to the hospital's outpatient services this year, in addition to 1,459 people who were injected with preventive vaccines, a total of 8,739 cases were treated, including 1,908 cases of dysentery, 265 cases of enteritis, 875 cases of indigestion, 692 cases of gastritis, 679 cases of influenza, 556 cases of abdominal pain, 480 cases of constipation, 430 cases of gastroenteritis, 387 cases of diarrhea, 186 cases of intestinal parasites, 167 cases of malaria, 46 cases of stomach cramps, 1 case of heat stroke, and 1,167 cases of miscellaneous diseases. A total of 484 patients were hospitalized, including 6 cases of acute gastroenteritis. The medicine was ineffective, but after injecting saline, the symptoms improved greatly, and all of them were discharged safely. One patient, Bao Fuqing, was so grateful for being saved that he specially presented a plaque with the four characters "You Revived Me", which has been sent to the hospital for display. However, there were more cases of dysentery this year, with dangerous symptoms, and a total of 5 people died from the disease. One person died from heat stroke after ineffective treatment, for a total of 6 deaths. It is also known that the total expenses of the hospital this year were more than 5,430 yuan, of which more than 1,100 yuan were for medicines. This is because there were more cases of dysentery, so the cost of medicines was high, accounting for more than 20% of the total. On average, each patient cost more than 6 jiao and 2 fen, which is a reduction of one-quarter compared to the previous year.</p>

<p>The General Headquarters of the Chinese Red Cross Society held its second membership solicitation committee. Zhang Zilian and Hong Yanbin were hired as the captains of the team. Zhang and Hong felt that it was not easy to solicit members at this time of economic recession, but the Red Cross Society was related to international charity and could not be delayed, so they decided to expand the solicitation. They have invited famous amateur performers from Shenshang Hengshe and other theaters, as well as celebrities, to join forces to perform their best plays in order to arouse interest in soliciting members. They will perform day and night at the Sanxing Theater on Niuzhuang Road on the 27th, 28th, and 29th of this month. The repertoire includes Li Baishui's Battle of Red Cliffs, Wang Qijun's Chasing Letters, Zhang Yaoquan's Zhou Yu Returns to Heaven, Shen Yuanyu's Miss Mu Tianwang, Chen Shanzhang's White Gate Tower, Shao Zuolong's Dumu Pass, Wang Duanpu and Wang Duanrong's joint performance of Scolding the Hall, Wang Xiaolai and Hong Yanbin's joint performance of Nengtu Goes to Court, You Jusun's Flooding the Seven Armies, Rong Boming's Drunkenness, Guo Xiaotiao's Complete Painful History of the Late Ming Dynasty, and famous celebrities will perform their best plays. It is said that buying five tickets can get one Red Cross Society membership, and buying a ticket for 10 yuan can get one Red Cross Society permanent membership.

<p>Mr. Zhu Shuzheng, a local resident and English professor, has been teaching English for nearly thirty years. Recognizing that high school students often fail to express themselves adequately in English writing, he has compiled a "Model Practice for Varying English Phrases and Sentences," in addition to his previous work "The Essence of English Grammar," to meet the needs of middle schools everywhere. It is now heard that several renowned local middle schools, due to the Municipal Education Bureau's decision to conduct spot checks on students' practice assignments in various subjects from this semester onwards, are adopting this book as a practice textbook for senior high school students. Short weekly compositions are alternated with model practice, so that students can effectively learn to vary phrases and sentences, achieving a clear and thorough understanding. Recently, this book has been selling extremely well, priced at fifty cents. The main distributor is Nanyang Model Middle School in Xujiahui. Consignment sales are available at the Shen Bao Service Department, Author Bookstore, Life Bookstore, and Qixin Bookstore.</p>

<p>The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau has received a letter from the Procuratorate of the Rui'an District Court in Zhejiang Province, which states: "The Rui'an County Government Public Security First Bureau has forwarded a case involving Lin Li abducting children. This office has conducted several court hearings. According to Lin Li's initial confession, she is from Jiaxing, and her husband, named Lin Liuhua, is a car mechanic in Pingyang. Having received no news from home for a long time, on July 14th, she took her seven-year-old nephew, A Mao, and her five-year-old son, A San, from Shanghai to Pingyang to find her husband. Later, she claimed to be working as a servant for a Cai family residing on the upper floor of the first door on the right side of a small lane by the Tangjiawan vegetable market in Shanghai. She said that the older child, surnamed Cai, was her son, and the younger one was her nephew. On July 4th, Mr. Cai asked her to accompany him to send the two children to Ningbo as guests. Upon arriving in Ningbo, he asked her to send them to Wenzhou. When arrested in Rui'an, Mr. Cai escaped. Judging by the circumstances, these two children are not his own sons, etc. After investigation, it was found that the woman's confessions were inconsistent. Further investigation by the Public Security First Bureau revealed that Lin A Mao claimed that the woman was not his mother. It is certain that these children were abducted. However, due to their young age, they cannot remember their home address. It is not possible to determine the truth of their names and ages. In addition to keeping them in the orphanage, we are sending photographs and requesting that you investigate and publish a notice seeking their families." Therefore, we are specially publishing a notice seeking their families, hoping that the children's family members will be informed and contact the Bureau in person.</p>

<h3 id="e142">Special Article: Opinions on the Issue of Increasing Credit Instruments (5) <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>(7) Application of New Credit Instruments in the Financial Market: The progress of the financial system is seen in the concentration of power and the flexibility of turnover, while the progress of the credit system lies in transforming stagnation into circulation. However, the so-called "progress" must still be premised on the improvement of the national economy. Therefore, although the past real estate boom in Shanghai transformed stagnation into circulation, it was not enough to be called progress.</p>
<p>The same is true for credit transactions. Following the old-fashioned account system leads to immediate stagnation. Therefore, changing to bill acceptance can transform stagnation into circulation. This kind of technical improvement has subtle differences on the surface, but the implications are far-reaching. It is like the steam in a kettle, which, once introduced into a steam engine, unexpectedly becomes the driving force of human civilization in an epoch-making way. At present, there are indeed many loans in China's financial industry, but due to neglect of technical improvements, the stagnant ones have not been transformed into circulation. It is believed that if we want to establish a modern credit system, we must promote the above-mentioned modern credit instruments in the following three aspects: A. Replace the current factory mortgage loans with the acceptance of corporate bonds.</p>
<p>B. Replace the current movable property mortgage loans with bank acceptance drafts. C. Discount commercial acceptance drafts to replace the current credit loans. While the money supply is not yet relaxed, it is not possible to play a larger role in the corporate bond aspect in one fell swoop. However, for the sake of promotion, each bank can immediately select companies with outstanding credit, advise them to issue bonds, and accept them themselves. At the same time, they can cooperate with the Chinese Business Securities Exchange to make a public auction, so that the bonds can circulate in the market, and the industrial securities market can be established. In the future, anyone who requests a loan secured by a factory mortgage will be planned for the issuance of corporate bonds. When banks accept corporate bonds, although they also have to pay the same funds, after the bonds are auctioned on the exchange, they can gradually flow into the hands of general investors. Since transactions have an official market price, it is not difficult to obtain financial accommodation through mortgages in times of urgency. This is very different from the current stagnant factory mortgage loans.</p>
<p>Regarding the promotion of bank acceptance drafts, the Joint Preparatory Committee of the Bankers Association has jointly established a bill acceptance office. The method is that industrial and commercial entrepreneurs who need financing provide collateral to the office. After the office approves it, they can issue drafts for the office to accept. These acceptance drafts can be purchased or discounted by each bank. Applicants for acceptance can use it to obtain financial accommodation. After banks purchase or discount these drafts, they can still sell or rediscount them to obtain financial accommodation when they need funds themselves. Therefore, bank acceptance drafts can be listed as secondary reserves in peacetime, and their liquidity is very different from that of current mortgage loans.</p>
<p>Commercial acceptance drafts are currently being strongly promoted by the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce. The silk and satin industry and the electrical machinery and silk weaving industry associations have already implemented them first. The method is that when industrial and commercial entrepreneurs sell goods on credit, unlike the current method of only registering accounts after receiving a reply, making it a kind of stagnant account receivable, they instead use the procedure of issuing drafts and having the buyer accept them, making it a negotiable receivable. After acceptance, the draft can be discounted at a financial institution to obtain financial accommodation. After the financial institution discounts the draft, it can also obtain financial accommodation through rediscounting when needed. Therefore, in various Western countries, commercial acceptance drafts have also become the second reserve of the financial industry. Compared with the current credit loans, which are both dangerous and extremely stagnant, it is truly a world apart.</p>
<p>After the financing methods of the financial industry are transformed according to the above three aspects, the abnormal development of the long-term capital market can be gradually shifted, the industrial securities market can be established, and the short-term capital market can be completely rationalized and modernized. The result is that, in addition to turning stagnation into circulation, the financing of long-term capital is made public due to the issuance of industrial securities, and the financing of short-term capital can also be used to observe the general trend of expansion and contraction from the acceptance and rediscount amounts, prevent problems before they occur, and obtain accurate targets. Compared with the current financing of each doing its own thing and not consulting each other, which leads to unlimited credit expansion and accelerated cycles of panic, the progress is not to be compared with reason. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e144">The National Products Industry and the Revival of Industry and Commerce <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>— Yang An</p>
<p>Credit Instruments and Knowledge of Final Accounts</p>
<p>There are two major issues in the National Products industry that should be urgently addressed, namely the (1) opinions on the issue of increasing credit instruments and (2) knowledge of final accounts for industrial and commercial institutions, published by the Committee for the Revival of Industry and Commerce. These two issues have been discussed by the committee's sub-group several times before being presented to society. Our National Products industry should earnestly accept and diligently study them, so as to open a new record in future business operations.</p>
<p>(1) The insufficiency of credit instruments has been unanimously recognized by the Chinese people. The fact that the majority of our National Products industry can operate businesses worth hundreds of thousands of yuan with tens of thousands of yuan of capital is entirely dependent on credit instruments. Now, with the tightening of finance and the reduction of the use of credit instruments, the impact on our National Products industry is the greatest. Now that the Committee for the Revival of Industry and Commerce has made contributions to expanding credit instruments, our National Products industry should sincerely cooperate with the financial industry and implement (1) replacing the current factory mortgage loans with the acceptance of corporate bonds, (2) replacing the current movable property mortgage loans with bank acceptance drafts, and (3) replacing the current credit loans with the discounting of commercial acceptance drafts. Before implementation, it is especially necessary to study management, strengthen strength, refine products, and reduce costs, so as to gain the trust of the financial industry and comrades who wholeheartedly promote national products. Otherwise, if the content is corrupt and the business is declining, any facility will be futile and useless. This is one thing that the National Products industry should pay attention to.</p>
<p>(2) The handling of final accounts by industrial and commercial institutions is the most important undertaking, but the procedures handled by the industrial and commercial sectors have always been inadequate. For example, the provision of depreciation, the preparation of bad debts, the making of dividends as expenses, the inclusion of customer accounts in the cash balance, and various bills are all inappropriate in strict terms. Now the Committee for the Revival of Industry and Commerce can pay attention to this and invite accounting experts to agree on a copy of the knowledge of handling final accounts, showing accounting staff the way to go and the standards that should be followed. This is of great benefit to national product factories. It is hoped that the authorities of each factory will pay attention to and implement it quickly, so as to sweep away the troubles of the previous confusion accounts. It is not difficult to handle final accounts, but it is difficult to fit the accounting system and the principle of fairness. This is the second thing to pay attention to.</p>
<p>The above-mentioned is extremely important. If the people can have no demands on others and give full play to the spirit of doing their best, then the one line of vitality in the National Products industry will belong to this.</p>
<h3 id="e145">The Crisis of Massive Imports of Luxury Goods <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>— Xuan Wan</p>
<p>Everyone knows that China's huge trade deficit in recent years is a fatal injury to the bankruptcy of our entire national economy. However, the term "trade deficit" seems too general and needs to be analyzed in detail, because China is a country with very backward industries. Therefore, in the entire trade deficit, there are also many machines and materials that are necessary for the development of national products. We must certainly make good use of this kind of thing to improve the current production and promote the Chinese economy to a completely self-sufficient stage.</p>
<p>However, what I want to point out in particular here is that in the entire trade deficit, there is a crisis of massive imports of luxury goods over the years, and the luxury goods I am talking about here include all perfumes, rouge, cosmetics, real and fake jewelry, cigarettes, cigars, various wines, soda, candy, shark fins, bird's nests, etc. In the present situation of poverty and exhaustion of wealth, there should no longer be such a huge consumption, but facts speak louder than words. For example, during the National Products Year for Women last year, it was discovered that more than one million yuan of cosmetics were imported, which caused great controversy. Even this year, when the market is becoming increasingly lifeless and the business of national product factories is becoming more difficult, newspapers tell us that imports of cosmetics are still pouring in. According to statistics, it has only decreased by 15% compared to last year. I think no one can be satisfied with this and feel that the future of the National Products Movement still requires greater efforts!</p>
<p>Moreover, I recently saw an article by Mr. Gu Yuantian in the Economic Weekly of the Ta Kung Pao, "The Awareness We Should Have Regarding Reducing the International Trade Deficit," which included a comparative table of the value of luxury goods and the value of the trade deficit since 1934. According to his statistics, the value of luxury goods over these many years accounts for more than 22% of the total value of the trade deficit, which shows that the amount of luxury goods consumed by the Chinese people is really alarming. Although it is said that a part of it is consumed by foreign residents in China, the quantity will never be so large. China is still in an era of such backward industries, but it has such a large consumption, which is a most terrible phenomenon. If the Chinese people can recognize the difficulties of the times earlier, and everyone is willing to save and work hard to produce and build, and turn all the trade deficit of luxury goods into productive products such as machinery and materials; then I think the development of the Chinese economy would have made considerable achievements long ago. But the Chinese people are going against the grain, which gives us such a serious feeling and requires everyone to urgently find ways to make greater efforts in the National Products Movement and the Thrift Movement to save it.</p>
<p>We know that the consumers of luxury goods are mostly the urban bourgeoisie, who have a wealth of knowledge. Now that the country has reached such a state, you can all wake up!</p>
<h3 id="e146">Yixing Kiln and Huishan Clay <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>— Rong Yu</p>
<p>When you go to people's houses to see, the teapots and teacups they use are of Western goods for the superior ones, and Japanese goods for the secondary ones. When asked why they don't use Chinese goods, they say in unison: "Jiangxi goods are too expensive, and they are not exquisite at all! I remember when I was a child, the toys I played with were always made of clay, such as 'Big Afu,' 'Wenchang,' and 'God of Wealth.' I made vows like Buddha with a few little partners, and it was quite interesting. Now the things that children play with are not right, what Western dolls! Rubber animals! Toy guns! It's really all kinds of things, much more interesting than before. It's a pity that most of these things are not quasi-national products." These two feelings made me think of "Yixing Kiln" and "Huishan Clay," so I will briefly describe some opinions below:</p>
<p>Yixing is a county in Jiangsu Province, and the mud produced there is fine, clean, and very viscous, so it is considered a good material for making kiln embryos. The kiln households in this area specialize in making teapots and teacups, so Yixing teapots can also be considered famous all over the world. The color of the mud is purple-red, so the things that are fired are also this color, antique and charming, which is also lovely. If the fine things are topped with a layer of wonderful color, then red, yellow, blue, and white can be made at will. I think the teapots and teacups produced in Yixing are not outdated, but unfortunately, the workers who make them now still stick to the old methods, so the production is slow and the cost is high. If scientific methods are used to increase the rate, and specialized talents are used to improve them, I am afraid that Yixing teapots and teacups will surpass foreign goods. I hope that the local kiln households will work hard soon!</p>
<p>Speaking of Huishan clay sculptures, they were also famous all over the country in the past, and every child had a "Big Afu" to play with. Since the advent of new-style toys, this "Big Afu" has been in the ranks of being overthrown. This is also not their fault. First, Big Afu is clumsy and ugly, and second, it is broken when touched. Now many workers who sculpt clay figures also know how to improve it, what models! What Liu, Guan, and Zhang's three knots of justice! All kinds of new patterns are sculpted. However, these things can only get the taste of general lower-level people, and upper-middle-class families rarely buy them for display. I think if we improve it further, and imitate the method of sculpting plaster statues in the West, we can sculpt half-length portraits of famous people from ancient and modern times with mud, or heroes, or beauties, all painted with powder and not colored. This can also win the favor of people who love beauty!</p>
<p>Although the above two things are small productions, if they are improved and promoted, they are also a strange soldier in the National Products industry!</p>
<h3 id="e147">Thoughts on the Closure of Yili General Company <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Mengzhao</p>
<p>Starting a business is difficult! But keeping a business is even more difficult! We can learn from the sudden closure of the Taifeng Sugar Vegetable Biscuit Company and the sudden liquidation of the Shanghai National Products Company. When the alarming news came that the Yili General Company, famous for its Yili soda, was also closed, alas! Why are there so many unfortunate news in the National Products industry?</p>
<p>Yili's soda is undoubtedly a leader in the National Products cold drink category! The reporter's family loves it deeply. Every summer, this thing is indispensable! I recall that when Mr. Yu Qiaqing celebrated his 50th anniversary in Shanghai, the reporter also participated in the grand ceremony! The celebrities gathered together, and it was very hot, and they were sweating non-stop, and there were many Yili sodas on the banquet, and everyone drank as much as they wanted, regarding it as a treasure! I have since regarded Yili soda as a friend!</p>
<p>The company's debt reached more than 1.3 million yuan, and all the assets were quite sufficient to offset it. I sincerely hope that the creditors will consider the National Products cause and that it is difficult to start and maintain it! To give it maintenance is not only the luck of the company, but also the luck of the future of the National Products!</p>
<h3 id="e148">Using National Products is a Matter of Conscience <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>— Li Jialu</p>
<p>If we walk on the road, we can see the signs of the stores, which write "Jingguang Foreign Goods," "Unified Handling of East and West Foreign Goods," "European and American Foreign Goods." How many signs can we see that are "Completely National Products" and "Unified Handling of National Products"? That's simply as rare as the morning stars!</p>
<p>I heard that this year is the Student National Products Year. If you don't believe me, we just need to walk into any majestic academy to visit, and all we see are neatly dressed young men in suits and ladies in 1936-style high-heeled leather shoes. It's difficult to find a few friends who use national products, oh! Is this the result of promoting the Student National Products Year?</p>
<p>Some people say: "Promoting national products in the countryside," in my opinion, is unnecessary, because their clothing, food, housing, and utensils are authentic old-brand national products! It's better to save some energy and blow more to the people in the city who are infatuated with foreign goods, and give them a few injections of morphine for using national products!</p>
<p>Using foreign goods is everyone's freedom, and there is no explicit provision in the law. Now it's just a matter of "conscience"! So it is said: "The four characters of psychological construction are indeed needed."</p>
<h3 id="e149">A Tour of the National Products Cigarette Exhibition <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>— Qi Ni</p>
<p>After the 88th Festival, the silence of the National Products cigarette industry was broken, and the National Products Cigarette Exhibition was an unprecedented initiative, so not only people in the cigarette circle felt excited, but also people outside the circle were stimulated by a new kind of stimulation. Look, how lively was the Great World a few days ago, and every visitor's face was smiling to accept a pack of cigarettes that was given to him.</p>
<p>Passing through the aisle is the National Products Gate; however, this gate has only a frame, and in reality, there is no gate to open and close. There is a couplet on the left and right sides of the door frame that says, "The Maintenance Association works hard to maintain the movement, and the Chinese people should smoke Chinese cigarettes." A National Products Gate lantern is hung in the center of the door frame, and there are also two National Products Cigarette Maintenance Association's large support lamps on the ground. Some people say that this looks like a yamen, which is true, the National Products Gate is as solemn as a yamen. The exhibition hall is in the open space in front of the Republican Hall. The smoke is lingering, and the lights are brilliant. Generally, the nightingales who are neatly dressed are smiling coquettishly at the tourists in this hall. There is a large model of a cigarette in the hall, which is made of pieces of iron, eight feet and eight inches long, and as high as the clouds. Such a long cigarette may seem small in the eyes of the people of the country of adults, but it is rare for us to see, so tourists are all amazed. The surrounding area of ​​this cigarette model is the display place of each cigarette factory, and they also sell their various products. The most beautiful display is the Maisgan Pavilion. The pillars are wrapped with red and blue cloths. The counter is a joint enlargement of the red and blue Maisgan cards. Two large cigarettes are spraying sandalwood scents like two anti-aircraft guns. There are also two young girls in the left and right corners, wearing pretty red and blue cheongsams. This must be the red and blue five langs they said in the advertisement. If you think that their faces are painted with red and blue colors, that is absurd. A dwarf stands at the display place of the Huaphi Cigarette Company. He stands on an orange, with large ear rings, paper flowers on his forehead, and a pair of flat, small, and slightly square breasts on his chest. These are fake breasts made of cotton wrapped in red silk. This fake African can also attract the attention of general tourists, but I think if you replace it with a beautiful woman, then the effect will be better!</p>
<p>Many people surround the railing, watching and commenting on the gains and losses, which seems to be very energetic. After strolling around twice, I felt that this exhibition really took a lot of people's efforts, and the efforts of the National Products Cigarette Maintenance Association can also make people pay attention to it.</p>
<h3 id="e150">The Dark Horse of the Domestic Rubber Industry <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>— Kang Sheng</p>
<p>Since the rubber industry in our country rose in 1928 and was at its peak, it has recently shown a trend of overall collapse. The reasons for this are nothing more than the devaluation and dumping of foreign goods and the bankruptcy of the rural economy. However, the biggest reason for its failure is that the goods do not know how to improve, the management is not refined, and the rough manufacturing has ruined the reputation. As a result, the market is shrinking, sales are decreasing, and turnover is difficult, so it has become a situation where the mountain rain is about to come and the wind is filling the building.</p>
<p>In this rubber industry, the only one who can strive for survival, be self-reliant, and be the pillar in the middle of the stream is the Zhengtian Xinji Factory, the creator of Warrior sneakers. In the past, Zhengtian Factory was famous throughout the country for its Dasheng brand overshoes, running shoes, and sneakers. The quality was excellent, and everyone knew it, so it was known as the "old general in shoes." After reorganizing Xinji, it sought further advancement and worked hard for revival. With a long-term vision and strong perseverance, it eliminated all inferior products and decided to use high-quality raw materials, the latest technology, and scientific management to create crystallized products that meet modern purchasing principles. Warrior sneakers are especially the outstanding products of the factory. Since its launch, it has still been able to make a name for itself even in this fragmented and depressed market. This phenomenon is really the price of the factory's efforts. The factory has also established a mail-order department a year ago to serve customers from afar to benefit the remote areas. Wherever there is a post office, you can directly write to purchase and enjoy the products of the factory. As for the rapid delivery, free postage and remittance fees, and the guarantee that the goods sent are perfect, it is meticulous and can be favored by customers from afar. Recently, there have also been ways to arouse users' interest and connect users' feelings, offering rewards to solicit methods, humbly seeking the advancement of business.

<p>The Shangyu Minguo National Goods Wool Yarn Company, organized by various renowned velvet yarn shops on Xingsheng Street, has recently produced two types of products: "Double Hand" brand and "Double Ocean" brand. They are soft, vividly colored, inexpensive, and of high quality. They are no less than imported goods. As a result, various merchant groups and managers are vying to order in advance, creating a situation where supply cannot meet demand. Due to the daily increase in sales and significant sacrifices, the company will slightly increase prices from January 1st to protect its capital. Furthermore, in the shortest period, they will launch the highest quality and most upscale "Chrysanthemum" brand velvet yarn to meet the needs of society.</p>

<h3 id="e164">Peng Sanmei and Ling Xitao Respond to Questions From the Guangdong Swimming Team Regarding the Failure to Select Wen and Xu as Representatives <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's newspaper reported that the Guangdong swimming team had questions about the swimming preliminary selection in this city. According to the Shanghai News reporter's investigation, swimming instructors Peng Sanmei and Ling Xitao have sent a letter to He Rugan stating:</p>
<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>After reading the newspaper, we learned that the Guangdong swimming team has some questions regarding the selection of swimming athletes in Shanghai. The swimming selection committee feels the need to respond. When the committee announced the call for city-wide participation in the preliminary selection and training, Wen Jingling did not register and did not participate in any of the training sessions. If he were allowed to be an athlete from this city simply because of his past achievements, those swimmers who trained on time every day and whose performance was equal to Wen would inevitably feel regretful for being eliminated. Furthermore, even if the committee allowed Wen to be an athlete, it is questionable whether Wen himself would be willing to serve Shanghai, as he has never expressed his opinion. Wen gave up voluntarily and was not eliminated. As for Xu Jun, he also did not register to participate in swimming. His most proficient event is volleyball. At the joint meeting of the Shanghai selection committees, it was generally agreed that athletes should develop their specialties and should not participate in multiple events. It has not yet been determined which unit Xu Jun will represent during the selection, so he was not selected. As for the diving performance, the committee specially invited Mr. Bai Li, the YMCA sports director, to assist in order to ensure fairness and accuracy. Mr. Bai did not know any of the participants and judged the performances based on the merits of their posture, being fair and impartial. We hereby declare, Ling Xitao and Peng Sanmei</p>

Representatives from Hong Kong are scheduled to meet today with Li Dachao of the municipal government to discuss matters concerning the football and swimming performances in Hong Kong, and to explore various details. The situation is as follows:</p>
<p>Athletes from Hong Kong Arrive in Shanghai One after Another: The Hong Kong team participating in this National Games includes track and field, swimming, football, men's and women's volleyball, and basketball. The number of participants in each category is highest for swimming and football, with 15 people each; men's and women's volleyball each have 12 people, basketball has 10, and track and field only has 4. As for the departure dates of each team, Yang, the Qiong sisters, Chen Zhenxing, and others departed yesterday aboard the Cleveland. Football star Li Huitang and He Jialiu, Xu Yipei, Xu Runpei, Hong Weizhao, and others also took this ship to Shanghai, expected to arrive in Shanghai on the night of the 27th or the morning of the 28th. The other ten-plus members of the swimming team have rescheduled to arrive in Shanghai on the 28th with the entire football team aboard the President Jefferson, expected to arrive around the 30th. The track and field, men's and women's volleyball, and basketball teams are scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on the Controverse on the 3rd of next month or the Empress of Canada on the 4th.</p>
<p>Performance Dates Already Decided: The swimming and football teams will depart first. Shanghai will hold football and swimming performance matches on the 2nd and 2nd of next month. The venues are planned to be the Municipal Stadium and the Municipal Swimming Pool. Currently, Ye Guanxuan, the chief director of the Hong Kong delegation, and Chen, the leader of the swimming team, are in consultation with the municipal government. Ye and others are also scheduled to meet with Li Dachao of the municipal government today to discuss performance matters. As for the strength of Hong Kong in each category in this National Games, track and field only sent 4 people due to a lack of special talent. The swimming team has Liu Baoxi, Chen Zhenxing, Yang Xiuqiong, Sha Huiying, Yang Xiuzhen, and others, and can still compete with the teams from China and Shanghai-Guangdong. The volleyball team originally had Chen Xibing and Lin Zhaohua, two famous players who had previously attended the Far Eastern Games. Now, Chen and Lin cannot come to Shanghai because the organizations they serve cannot grant them leave, so their strength is slightly reduced. The women's volleyball team has strong front and middle rows. The football team is weaker in the back line, the center backs are evenly matched with Guangzhou, and the forwards are even stronger. Football star Li Huitang has decided to represent Mancangpu and has been appointed as the captain. Recently, Li represented South China in a match against the Hong Kong Artillery, scoring six goals in a row. Right winger Li Zhaorong is a rising star and is no less than Tan Jiangbai, so their strength is quite strong, and they have high hopes of winning the championship in this National Games.</p>
<h3 id="e166">World Heavyweight Boxing Champion Baer Loses to Joe Louis, Falls in the Fourth Round and Cannot Get Up <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>(Havas News Agency, New York, 24th) The famous American boxer Baer, the world heavyweight boxing champion last year, was once defeated by Braddock in June of this year. He recently held a match with black boxer Joe Louis at Yankee Stadium, with as many as 90,000 spectators. The two fought until the fourth round, when Baer fell and could not get up, and was quite badly injured. The intensity of the battle was rare since he started boxing. According to reports, Joe Louis had the upper hand in the first round, because Baer did not follow the advice of the previous famous boxer, "Po Sai," and only adopted a weak offensive against Joe Louis, which allowed Joe Louis to take advantage of the situation. Under a fierce attack, Baer was immediately injured and bled. By the second round, Baer's movements were sluggish, allowing Joe Louis to dominate all the way. In the third round, the two fought fiercely again, but Baer still did not show any strength. Finally, he was knocked down by Joe Louis and struggled to get up after nine seconds. But in the fourth round, Baer finally couldn't hold on and fell, unable to get up again. The referee announced Joe Louis's victory, and the whole stadium was astonished.</p>

<p>"Catch her, stop her, chase after Curly Head! Run fast, boys, run fast!" Don shouted, running desperately in the direction she was going, because she was Mr. Pei's favorite, so if something bad happened to her, Don was afraid that he would be finished. Ah, they didn't know how far they ran, how many hundreds of times they shouted, and how many dozens of times they gasped for breath before they caught her! The fishing rods were abandoned behind them, and their legs almost broke while chasing after the cow; each boy's face was flushed, he was out of breath, and his heart was flustered. Finally, they found poor old Buttercup in a flower garden. She was exhausted after running a long distance and came here to hide. Don tied a rope around her head and led her home, followed by a group of very serious young men, because this cow made people sad to see. Originally, she had injured her shoulder and back when she jumped over the wall, so she limped, and her eyes looked like she was angry. Her once shiny hair was covered in mud and water.</p>
<p>"This time you're in trouble, Don," Tao Mo said, leading the wheezing donkey back with the abused old cow.</p>
<p>"You can't escape either, because you were an accomplice."</p>
<p>"We all have a share, except for Little Bridge," Xie Ke added.</p>
<p>"No, he was the first to bring it up," Neda said.</p>
<p>"I advised you not to do this," Little Bridge shouted, almost heartbroken at the sight of poor old Buttercup.</p>
<p>"Old Pei will not tolerate me, I think. Oh well, I don't care," Don grumbled, his tone was hard, but he really looked worried.</p>
<p>"We will all intercede for you, together," Little Bridge said, and everyone else agreed, except for Tai Fei, who secretly hoped that all the punishment would fall on one sinner. Don only said, "Don't bother for me": but he never forgot that. He was always worried, even though he encountered temptation and led the children astray again.</p>

<p>A diamond in the dark, without the grinding and polishing of stones, the radiant splendor hidden within the diamond would never be revealed. This is like the course of life, without struggling through hardships and difficulties, one will never accomplish great things.</p>
<p>There are many men and women in the world who could have accomplished great things but died old and insignificant because their expectations of themselves were too small.</p>
<p>Those who accomplish great things in the world are often not the darlings of the goddess of fortune, but rather the poor children of humble origins.</p>
<p>If you think your job is boring, then your feelings of aversion and boredom are enough to lead to the failure of your career; an optimistic, positive, and enthusiastic attitude is the magnet that attracts success and happiness.</p>
<h3 id="e176">Archaeologist Seeks Mother in Japan <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>— (Haiyuan, from Tokyo)</p>
<p>Li Zhaomu, a northern Chinese archaeologist, recently entrusted his friend in Japan, Bai Jian, to request the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department to find his biological mother. According to Bai, Li is 30 years old and a famous Chinese archaeologist. Zhaomu is his pseudonym. His father's name is Shengduo, from Jiujiang County, Jiangxi Province. Thirty-two years ago, in the 24th year of Guangxu in the Qing Dynasty, he served as the envoy to Japan for two years. Later, he inspected Europe and the United States and served as the envoy to Belgium. In the early years of the Republic of China, he successively served as the Civil Administrator of Shanxi Province and the Speaker of the Senate. He is now 78 years old and lives in Shanghai for his remaining years. When he served as the envoy to Japan, he cohabited with a Japanese woman named Yokogawa Kiku, from Akita Prefecture. She was the wife of Takano Fangtaro, the brother of Dr. Takano Iwataro, a doctor of law. Her husband died in Shanghai, so she returned to Li and gave birth to a son, Zhaomu. Li was transferred to serve as the Belgian envoy and took Kiku with him. Later, they suddenly separated for some reason. Kiku returned to Japan alone, while Zhaomu stayed with his father. Since then, they have never seen each other again. In his childhood, Zhaomu was raised by a nanny and barely knew his mother. As he grew older, his father told him the secret, and he learned where he came from and began to think about finding his mother. Years ago, he entrusted a friend to search in Japan, but there was no news, and he returned in disappointment. In recent years, Zhaomu has lived at No. 201, Qiushan Street, Japanese Concession, Tianjin, and enjoys a great reputation for archaeology. His longing for his mother has become more and more intense. Bai happened to go to Japan to study archaeology, so he entrusted him with this matter again.</p>
<p>After Bai entrusted the matter to the police department, the police department began to investigate. At 4:00 am on the 10th of this month, there was a phone call to Bai's residence at the Sanno Hotel in Akasaka. The caller was an old woman named Okamoto Saeko, who claimed to know about Yokogawa Kiku, who had passed away in the 22nd year. Bai was greatly surprised and quickly summoned the old woman to his residence for detailed inquiry. He learned that after Kiku returned to China, she lived in Kanasugi-cho, Shiba-ku, and was able to maintain her life with the assistance of her late husband's younger brother, Takano Iwao. She died of illness on January 22, 1914, at the age of 34. After her death, Takano Iwataro took care of the funeral and was buried in Komaagome Kichijo Temple, Tosa. Many years have passed, so few people know about it.</p>
<p>After Bai received this unexpected report, he begged the old woman to be his guide. Together with his friend, the painter Somyung Kasuga, he went to Kichijo Temple to search. He found a broken monument lying among the moss in a corner of the cemetery. Upon closer inspection, it had the words "Takano Family Tomb" on it. He also examined the books in the temple and confirmed that the name Yokogawa Kiku was recorded. Only then did he know that the old woman's words were not false. Soon, Bai sent a telegram to Li Jun, informing him of everything. I think Li Jun must be filled with mixed emotions of sadness and joy when he receives the telegram. He will come to Japan to visit the tomb soon, but I don't know if the old man on the sea will also shed old tears and regret his infidelity when he hears this news.</p>
<h3 id="e177">Memories of Mid-Autumn Festival in Nanhu <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>— Shufan</p>
<p>Taking three or five companions, I set sail on Nanhu Lake, intending to discuss essays in the misty rain. How carefree! The boat woman, surnamed Luo, told about her life on the lake, and then said sadly, "With guests, I can earn four or five yuan a day, but what I suffer is often unspeakable. As for rainy and snowy days, even if I am willing to sacrifice, there is no way to do so." How has the world changed so much? We all wrung our wrists in helplessness.</p>
<p>I traveled to the East Pagoda, desolate in the fading light. The wind chimes did not sound, much like people after middle age, unable to talk about prosperity and decline. Behind the pagoda is the tomb of Zhu Wengzi of the Han Dynasty, renovated during the Jiajing period of the Ming Dynasty. The monument has been broken in the middle, covered with tall grass. According to the Zhejiang Tongzhi: The East Pagoda Temple is the site of Zhu Maichen's house. Was the tomb embellished by good people? I secretly thought that Maichen did not have great merits at that time. Summing up his deeds, he only knew how to climb up to wealth and power and was arrogant to weak women. Compared with Su Ji, his character is even worse. How lucky to have a mound that has been passed down to this day.</p>
<p>I had lunch at the Fuyu Pavilion in the lake. The eyes of everyone under the ten thousand willows are green. Thinking of tonight's Mid-Autumn Festival, how necessary is it to be in a high palace in the sky if I can have a flying cup here? The building was built by Qian Yuanying of the Five Dynasties. It has been renovated and replaced. Unfortunately, the old couplets are all lost, causing the walls of the two corridors to be unsightly, which is unbearable. After the wine was over, the woman Luo begged to visit Chan Hui Temple, so I followed her. A boat headed west, passed the Haogu Pagoda, and a storm suddenly came. Listening to the clanging sound under the short awning that covered our knees, it was also pleasing. When we arrived at the temple, the rain was still drizzling. A young nun came out to entertain us. Her worldly attire made it seem impossible to talk to her about the life of Buddhism. The temple raised more than a dozen baskets of autumn silkworms, which were feeding vigorously, disturbing the sound of the dense rain. I resigned and returned to the oar, the wind became more violent, and sweat poured down my back, wetting the oars and sculls. The boatman suffered! In the evening, we arrived at the Mist and Rain Tower. The electric lights were dim, so we looked for candles to replace them. The starlight was dim, and it was difficult to describe its ancient simplicity. The lake smoke became heavier, and the bright moon was never to be seen! So we had fun guessing riddles until late at night. On this trip, those in the same boat, Fenweng, Xueming, Shicheng, and Zhensheng, all had poems for the literary and art competition. The initiators were the Shanghai Yousheng Travel Group.</p>

<p>Ze Cheng heard that he wouldn't be coerced, but he was afraid that he really would be. So he smiled at him and said, "Alright, don't worry, I can definitely help you with this." As he said that, he stood up and shook his hand a couple of times. In Jie Fu's heart, he was overjoyed and wanted to jump, but his face remained stern without a trace of a smile. After Ze Cheng left, he fell onto the bed from afar, raising his legs high and stretching them wildly in the air. Suddenly, he heard Li Shilian laugh outside the window, "Brother Jie Bian even knows martial arts." Jie Fu jumped up, stretched his hands twice, and said with a smile towards the outside of the window, "I have rules, I must do ten minutes of stretching exercises before going to bed." Li Shilian said, "Then, please rest, let's talk again tomorrow morning." As he said that, he returned to his room, thinking in his heart, it seems that when working outside, this skill of currying favor is really indispensable. Zhang Jie Fu flattering Commissioner Lan was something he had personally witnessed, wasn't that just a hard-sell flattery? So, starting from tomorrow morning, he would also go and curry favor with Jia Duocai. Although they were old friends for many years, when it came to asking for favors, that couldn't be said, he had to act expediently. With this change of mind, he also thought of a way to start. The next day, he got up early and went specifically to the most famous Nanyuan Gate in Xi'an to buy some snow cream, perfume, exquisite handkerchiefs, scented soap, etc., tied into a large package, and returned to the hotel to deliver it to Jia Duocai. The words he wanted to say were also carefully thought out. When he arrived at the door of Jia Duocai's room, he was taken aback. He saw his face was flushed red, sitting on a chair near the door, his left hand supporting his head, his right hand pressing his leg, seemingly very angry. The leg that was about to step into the door involuntarily retracted backward. (325)</p>

<p>After waiting for about five or six minutes, Zhang Decai went forward again to lift the lid, letting the Empress Dowager or one of us take a handful of the chrysanthemum petals and throw them in. Then he put the lid back on the stove and waited another five minutes. This special food was cooked. Every time the lid was lifted and the chrysanthemum petals were thrown in, the Empress Dowager had to keep instructing: actually, we and Zhang De were already skilled, she really didn't need to bother so much!</p>
<p>The taste of the fish slices poached in chicken soup was already fresh enough. Adding the clear fragrance of the chrysanthemums made it feel even more delicious. The chrysanthemums themselves originally didn't have much flavor, but after being rendered with chicken soup and fish slices, they were also very delicious. When the Empress Dowager was happy eating, she would often eat many by themselves. We stood beside her, inhaling the aroma, but it felt very uncomfortable. Occasionally, when the Empress Dowager was merciful and told us to share what she had left over, we were overjoyed. No one was willing to be polite anymore, wishing they could swallow it all by themselves.</p>
<p>The Empress Dowager not only loved to use chrysanthemums as a delicious accompaniment to meals, but also loved to use them instead of soap to wash her hands. This so-called washing of hands was not because her hands were dirty, but rather just washing for fun. Every time, the old lady would pick a bud that was about to bloom from the chrysanthemums inserted in a vase or placed in a pot, tear it apart, put it in her palm, and rub it hard, rubbing until the flower leaves all turned to渣, and then discard it. But she didn't wash her hands immediately, but just opened her palms and let them dry on their own. After a while, she would wash them with warm water, but the chrysanthemum fragrance had already remained on her palms, and her skin seemed to be dyed with a light green color. (425)</p>

<p>— Gu Yixin</p>
<p>I once traveled lightly to Jinlu, lodging in an inn. Early in the morning, when the dream had just ended, I heard a faint, flowing sound, clamorous laughter, mixed and noisy. I found it strange. Soon, the door opened, and those who entered were flower girls: carrying bamboo baskets, their appearances pleasing, three or five in a group, rushing to the bedside, each trying to sell their fragrant flowers. I refused, but they wouldn't listen. I huddled under the covers and examined them closely. They were about fourteen or fifteen years old, their figures no taller than the flower-announcing wind. Although they wore simple clothes, it didn't diminish their charming appearance. Although their skin was dark, the traces of powder on their faces were still fresh. The girls, seeing me staring blankly, used white orchids to touch my shirt. I thought, if they act like this, how is it different from a roaming cloud goddess? So, I gave them two small silver coins and told them to leave. They pestered me again, asking for more. I showed an angry expression and loudly called for the tea server. Only then did they reluctantly leave. When I got up and finished washing, I checked the cigarettes on the table, and the remaining cigarette was already gone. So, I just let it be.</p>
<p>At noon, my friend Su visited me and saw the flower pinned to my shirt. He laughed and said, "Have you been surrounded by flower girls?" I asked the reason. He said: "When a lone traveler lodges here, these girls think of them as customers, and they have a tacit agreement with the tea servers, allowing them to enter the rooms directly and make a ruckus. Because this place is close to Tiger Hill and the seven realms of Shantang, the flower market is very prosperous. Families of humble backgrounds don't do needlework, so they all take selling flowers as their occupation. Although they work in the early hours of the morning, their income is enough to support a family. Little girls love to adorn themselves, with messy hair and coarse eyes, they still apply rouge and powder. However, coming and going from inns, what they see and hear, how can they forget their feelings? Therefore, scandalous stories spread among the masses. In Wuzhong, there are also foolish men who come specifically to flirt with these girls. The innkeeper is neither foolish nor deaf, so he profits from it. Recently, public security officers have been rectifying the city's appearance and paying attention to these girls, so they have already become somewhat restrained."</p>
<p>Yesterday, I met with my old friend Mr. Wu, and we chatted idly about the Mingxing Film Company's new sound film "Night Fragrance." He told me that the director Cheng Bugao had taken the fragrant stories of the flower girls and adapted them into this play. Hu Die, who had just returned from a tour of Europe, played the leading role. Die even played a flower girl, with a romantic and charming demeanor, deeply moving people. It is currently being shown publicly at the Xinguang Theater in this city. He invited me to go and see it. I immediately remembered my previous encounter and wrote it down here. I wonder if Hu Die's flower girl is more beautiful than the flower girl I met.</p>
<p>Notice to Mr. Li Liping: Received your message, inquiring about the original name of "Gray Wolf." I have forwarded the question to the author, who said that the original title is "Grey Wolf" by H.V. Armstrong, published by Barker Bookstore in England. You may want to ask the Bifaxi Bookstore on the east end of Nanjing Road in this city. Perhaps you can buy it there. Sincerely, Your Brother, Juan.</p>
<p>Short Story</p>
<h3 id="e181">A Wu <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>— Yi Qiu</p>
<p>When A Wu was seven years old, her father was working as a section chief, her mother was still healthy as usual, and her younger brother had just been born. The home was filled with an atmosphere of joy and happiness. Because A Wu was very beautiful and intelligent, her parents regarded her as the pearl in their palms, showing her extra love. Although she was already seven years old, the nanny still followed her at all times, attending to her every need.</p>
<p>Now A Wu is seventeen years old, just like a blooming flower, even more beautiful than before. Unfortunately, her fate has fallen into the most unfortunate and dire stage. Her father, suffering from third-stage tuberculosis, coughed and choked all day long. Her paralyzed mother lay on the rattan mat all day, moaning. There was also a nine-year-old younger sister and an eleven-year-old younger brother, constantly吵着闹着, wanting food and drink. Ah! Ten years apart, it has turned into such a tragic and unfortunate family. For the sake of her parents, younger brother, and younger sister's medicine and food, she had to take on all the responsibilities. After several considerations, she finally sacrificed everything and embarked on a path that was easier to earn money.</p>
<p>Every time the lights came on, A Wu would begin her work of applying rouge and powder, dressing herself up like a voluptuous and alluring flower, and being sent to a game field on the edge of West Lake to be picked by others. In this way, day after day, little by little, her secret was discovered by the people living in the same house. They all began to discuss it and started to despise her. When she walked past, they would curl their lips and curse, "Bitch! Slut! Staining the reputation of our neighbors!"</p>
<p>Although A Wu often heard this kind of scolding, she never dared to defend herself. She could only lower her head and let them curse and mock her. Her eyes were filled with tears of bitterness, which she could only shed to the moon outside the window when everyone was asleep.</p>
<p>Later, the residents, for the sake of their own reputation, moved out of this house. The landlord also learned about A Wu's profession and issued an eviction order. "Vacate the premises within a limited time!" Then the neighbors all satirized her in unison, "Ah, such a pretty young lady, turns out to be a婊子!"</p>
<p>The general public's criticism of A Wu is, "Selling her body every night, the most lowly woman! Should be treated with the most 冷酷 treatment!" At the same time, her father suffering from third-stage tuberculosis and her paralyzed mother were thinking, "Enduring great difficulties to serve her parents, younger brother, and younger sister, and still having to do night work, without the slightest complaint, truly a rare and precious filial daughter!"</p>

<p>Yesterday, the gold market continued to prosper, breaking through the $900 mark. Banks were eager to sell, and the foreign exchange market was difficult to revive.

In the early morning, the overseas silver market in England and the United States was flat, but the local market was soft. The forward silver price in Montreal fluctuated.

The US exchange rate was 37.5 yuan, compared with the previous closing price, the pound tightened by zero six two five, and the US dollar loosened by zero six two five.

The Central Bank's listed price was announced: the pound was flat and the US dollar rose by zero six two five. The customs gold unit did not move. Banks had a strong appetite to sell, and Sassoon also sold and then turned flat. However, because Mobil had some settlement of funds, it still hovered. It was predicted that HSBC bank would announce the listing price, with the pound flat and the US dollar rising by one two five. Afterwards, banks and Sassoon continued to sell, trending upwards. However, because Chinese businessmen were psychologically bullish, Guangdong banks were strongly purchasing US dollars. At this time, it gradually tightened back. However, banks still sold at high prices, which was temporary. Finally, Indian silver predicted a decrease of six annas. Although Chinese businessmen purchased, banks had a very strong desire to sell. At noon, the market was still loose.

<p>In recent years, financial circulation has been very difficult, and all banks and money shops have felt deserted. The foreign market is also very depressed. The foreign call loan rate is practically non-existent. For over a month, the morning and afternoon markets have both been at one jiao three fen. Yesterday, there was no change. Due to the fact that money shops were mostly short of funds and were being supplemented by the reserve treasury, no one paid attention to the market adding water, which was still a free draw. There were 3.4 million in morning market transfer transactions, over 500,000 in new transactions, over 100,000 in afternoon market transactions, over 900,000 in Small General Association transactions, 400,000 in foreign mortgage withdrawals, and over 700,000 in new transactions. 1.2 million banknotes were recovered, and over 600,000 circulation notes were issued, as well as over 900,000 marked notes.

As for Jiangnan small foreign coins, the morning market was 833 yuan, and the afternoon market was 830 yuan, 3 yuan less than the previous day's market. The made-up transaction volume was 2,000 jiaos in the morning market and nothing was heard in the afternoon market.

<h3 id="e185">Primary Debenture Market is a Scene of Chill, Daily Transactions Fall Below 2 Million <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the China Merchants Securities Exchange only traded October futures for one month. November futures will start trading today. Yesterday's trading was very slow and idle, and there has never been such a scene before. The total number of transactions for the whole day's four sessions was only 1,855,000, and the 961 item even accounted for 1,010,000 yuan. The decline in transactions can be imagined. The market price was affected and did not rise or fall at all. Only 96 trading was more than other types, and the market price was also better. However, it was retail investors buying in and large investors selling out. In fact, due to too few transactions, a slight entry and exit could control it. The market price was not a formal market price. The future is in the form of Italy and Argentina, and a burst is possible in an instant, which is not optimistic. After yesterday, four types failed to open in the opening, and the market price rose by five points. In the second session, more than ten types failed to open, only the salt tax 22nd pass and 96 had some transactions, and only five signs were hung. Half-day transactions totaled only 400,500 yuan, which was rare. In the afternoon opening and closing, there were still four or five types that failed to open in each session, and the market price was first tired and then stood up, with little difference. Today's result is that there are four or five types that have not been done at all, and the market price is only five points high or low, but the 96 rose by 3 jiao and a half. The total number of transactions, spot futures totaled 1,856,000 yuan. The results of its rise and fall are compared and listed on the left (unit yuan, transaction unit 100 yuan)</p>

<p>A report from the New Feng Foreign Firm states that yesterday (the 24th), the New York stock market experienced a lack of supply, resulting in firm prices. Speculators were mostly observing, waiting for a definite market trend to emerge. Automobile stocks were relatively active, while chemical and specialty stocks saw slight increases. The small exchange and bond market both rose, with a total daily transaction volume of one million.</p>
<h3 id="e187">The Yarn Market's Bullish Trend Continues, Buyers Scramble for New Contracts, Over 7,000 Bales Traded <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market's performance continues to improve, and the overall situation is becoming more favorable. Due to the high prices for Japanese yarn for this month's delivery, buyers are sweeping up all available supply, causing a shock to the market. Consequently, the price gap for October delivery has widened. At the same time, spot market conditions are considered good. The supply of 20-count Japanese yarn is particularly tight, and the price of 42-count thread is steadily rising. Chinese yarn is also trending firmer, contributing to the overall stability of the market.</p>
<p>The Golden Rooster's Bullish Momentum Continues, Pre-market trading in the yarn market opened with a noticeably unstable atmosphere, and the market lacked any exciting developments. This was due to the large volume of deliveries the previous day. However, after the second round of trading, although the volume of transactions between buyers and sellers was small, there was a lack of sellers, resulting in a tight supply situation. As a result, prices for all months rose by four, five, and seven cents. In the afternoon, the trend suddenly strengthened. Market sources indicated that of the goods buyers had acquired the previous day, 1,000 bales of 20-count Golden Rooster yarn had already been sold to the Guangdong group. Simultaneously, the supply of 20-count Japanese yarn was particularly tight, and thread prices rose steadily. Generally, prices for third-grade yarn also rose by one yuan, four cents, and seven cents. Consequently, short covering occurred, and market prices gradually increased. As a result, prices for all months rose by five, six, seven, nine cents to one yuan compared to the morning closing prices. According to investigations, the new contracts for this month's delivery include 1,700 bales of 20-count Golden Rooster yarn, 700 bales of Bao Yi yarn, 700 bales of Earth yarn, 150 bales of Shepherd yarn, 2,410 bales of 17-count Fortune yarn, 590 bales of 16-count Fortune yarn, and 1,100 bales of Double Dragon yarn, totaling 7,350 bales. The total amount of yarn in warehouses, including previous stocks, is 8,435 bales. Sales include 350 bales of Ji Feng yarn, 300 bales of Ming De yarn, 750 bales of Sai Feng yarn, 500 bales of Tong Fu yarn, 300 bales of Tong Ji yarn, 450 bales of Yuan Da yarn, 350 bales of Tong Feng yarn, 550 bales of Shen Ji yarn, 350 bales of Xie Cheng yarn, 350 bales of Da Chang yarn, and 450 bales of Yong Da yarn.

The highest, lowest, and closing prices for the day are as follows:</p>
<p>Spot Yarn Sales are Decent</p>
<p>Spot yarn sales are still being maintained. According to statistics, various groups bought a total of 1,205 bales throughout the day. Market sentiment is trending firmer.</p>
<p>Changsha 200 bales</p>
<p>Inland 410 bales</p>
<p>Hankou 80 bales</p>
<p>Shantou 95 bales</p>

<p>Fellow Traders 35 bales</p>
<p>Yunnan 20 bales</p>
<p>Jiangxi 20 bales</p>
<p>Tianjin 10 bales</p>
<p>The cotton market is trending firmer due to the rise in the yarn market. Although the supply from various sources is abundant, mills are also actively buying, with little hoarding. Market sources in the afternoon reported that Japanese factories in Qingdao are purchasing general-grade cotton in Shanghai, further boosting market sentiment.</p>
<p>Zheng Biao Cotton Breaks the Two-Yuan Barrier The cotton market opened with price increases across all months. American cotton rose by five to eight points, while Indian cotton fell by two to three rupees. However, the price of cotton for labeling purposes steadily increased. Market sources indicated that although the supply of Tongzhou cotton and Yuyao cotton is abundant, demand from mills is decent, and warehouses are not hoarding. Market sentiment is positive. Furthermore, some believe that the violent price surge that occurred in the yarn market on October 18th of last year remains deeply ingrained in the minds of those with sensitive nerves. New sellers are cautious, resulting in a tight market and sellers being hesitant. As a result, prices for all months rose by one and a half to two and a half cents compared to the previous day's closing prices. In the afternoon, rumors surfaced that Qingdao was buying general-grade cotton, causing prices to steadily increase, breaking through the two-yuan barrier across all months. As a result, prices for all months rose by two to three cents compared to the morning closing prices. Sales included 2,200 dan of Da Fu cotton, 1,500 dan of Jin Chang cotton, 2,000 dan of Shen Ji cotton, 1,600 dan of Yuan Yi cotton, 2,000 dan of Sheng Yuan cotton, 1,700 dan of Yuan Da cotton, 2,200 dan of Geng Feng cotton, 1,400 dan of Sen Kang cotton, 1,500 dan of Tai Chang cotton, 1,800 dan of Xin Heng cotton, and 5,000 dan of Chang He cotton. Purchases included 1,600 dan of Da Fu cotton, 4,800 dan of He Xing cotton, 2,000 dan of Yuan Xing Chang cotton, 2,400 dan of Chang He cotton, 1,200 dan of Heng Yi cotton, 2,900 dan of Da Feng cotton, 1,000 dan of Ren Feng cotton, 1,600 dan of Da Chang Cheng cotton, 2,500 dan of Chang Feng cotton, 1,800 dan of Run Kang cotton, 1,400 dan of Da Chang cotton, and 1,300 dan of Tong He cotton. The highest, lowest, and closing prices for the day are as follows:</p>
<p>Mill Demand is Still Moderate</p>
<p>Spot cotton consumption remains sluggish, and mill demand is not strong. The supply of Yao cotton is 3,100 bales, and the supply of general-grade cotton is 41 bales.</p>
<h3 id="e188">Recent Purchases of American Cotton by the Industry <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the American cotton market opened with price fluctuations of one point across all months. Trading activity remained active. Long positions for October delivery were gradually closed out and shifted to later months. Traders were buying near-month contracts, while brokers and foreign firms were buying far-month contracts. Short selling was limited. The cotton harvest is delayed, and activity in Texas and Oklahoma is not expected to be strong before mid-October. At the same time, spot prices have also improved, leading to firm market prices. Subsequently, prices softened slightly due to some profit-taking and short selling, but remained stable at the close. Spot prices rose by five points, while futures prices rose by three to eight points. British spot cotton fell by three points, and futures fell by one point. Indian cotton weakened due to speculative and retail long liquidation. Pingguoer fell by 1.5 rupees, Aomula fell by three rupees, and Bailuoxi fell by two rupees. (Telegraph report, 24th)</p>
<p>According to a Bombay telegram, the opening forecast for Bailuoxi cotton on the 25th is 206 rupees, the same as the previous day's close.</p>
<h3 id="e189">Flour Futures Rise, Nanyang Group Purchases <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, flour prices opened steadily. Wheat quotes from Chicago were down by 4.8 cents, and Canadian wheat was down by 8 to 10 cents. Market participants, mindful of the ongoing negotiations regarding the Italy-Abyssinia issue, adopted a wait-and-see approach. At the same time, flour mills were slightly selling off forward contracts, leading to stable market conditions. However, speculators remained optimistic, resulting in a continued firm trend. In the afternoon, the market opened stronger due to favorable wheat market conditions and rising gold prices. Although buying activity was not strong, market sentiment gradually improved. In the final rounds of trading, news of purchases by the Nanyang group further tightened the market. It is anticipated that due to raw material costs, there is little hope for a significant price decline.</p>
<h3 id="e190">Contract Shortages, Wheat Market Hoarding <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, due to a slight drop in overseas wheat prices, contract prices for all months were stable. Trading volume in all rounds was not high. However, in the afternoon, prices for all months increased uniformly. Rumors circulated that overseas wheat prices had reached around six yuan, making it difficult to reconcile with current market prices. Consequently, short covering occurred, and news of purchases by the Tianjin group led to increased trading activity and rising prices. It is observed that with contract shortages, both domestic and foreign entities are inclined to hoard, causing concern about the future market outlook. In the spot wheat market, high-quality wheat in the southern market has reached four yuan, but flour mills have not bought due to high prices. The northern market has also tightened, and flour mills have not made significant purchases, with Fuxin buying 2,000 bags, and Fufeng and Shen Da each buying 500 bags. Shandong high-quality wheat is priced at four yuan, while wheat from Mingguang, Shahe, Yanghe, and Guantian is at three yuan and ninety-five cents, five to six cents higher than the previous market.</p>

<p>(Shanghai South) Yesterday, 30 ships arrived carrying nearly 6,000 shi of goods. In addition, from Qingdao and Yantai approximately 500 bales were procured. Market sentiment turned weak, and prices softened. As a result, prices for various types of rice saw a slight decline of one to two cents, except for early Nan Gang rice which was scarce and maintained a price increase of nearly one cent. Chang Gang and other thick-grain rice remained stable, and new indica rice also depreciated by two cents, but the East China factory maintained its position due to low inventory. New Luoyang tip rice and new Sichuan tip rice maintained a balance between supply and demand, and prices were steady but slightly weak. Stocks of old Luoyang tip rice have been exhausted for a long time, and remained unchanged. Cloudy Yuan Xin old rice prices softened.</p>
<p>(Shanghai North) Yesterday, 35 to 36 shipments arrived from various river downstream areas. Sales of white broken glutinous rice were sluggish, and high-quality rice prices were stable, while medium and lower grades increased by a few cents to one cent. The price of new East China indica rice was stable, and white Yuan rice sales were also active, with prices increasing by one cent. New Yang tip rice, round tip rice, Jiaobai tip rice, and Bu tip rice saw balanced sales, with stable prices. New guest tip rice sales were slightly more active, but the overall situation remained stable. Shipments of new Xixing indica rice continued to arrive, and it was sold at regular prices, with a softening price trend. Prices for thin rice and other types of rice remained largely unchanged.</p>

<p>Yesterday, sugar market traders continued to raise prices for domestic Chao Qing, Pian Qing, and Zhu Qing sugar. For example, the asking price for Ti Zhuang Qing sugar rose by three cents to ten yuan and four and a half cents, with over one hundred bales offered, followed by a price increase to eleven yuan.

<h3 id="e194">Ah Q's Father <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>— Cao Juren</p>
<p>Regarding Ah Q's family background, Mr. Lu Xun, the author of The True Story of Ah Q, was vague. He only mentioned in the preface: "The disciples of Mr. Hu Shih, who have a penchant for history and textual research, may be able to find many new clues in the future." I am not claiming to have discovered any new clues today; I was not born with those two obsessions, nor am I a disciple of Mr. Hu Shih. It seems unnecessary to pretend to be learned. However, the reason for lecturing on this topic stems from my thoughts at the Huang Family Garden that day. We are indeed very familiar with Ah Q's character; seeing Zhao Taiye's living room allows us to better understand Ah Q's life. An archaeologist can imagine the life of early humans upon finding a single tooth: since we are familiar with Ah Q's personality, it is not too far-fetched to speculate about the kind of person his father might have been.</p>
<p>Mr. Lu Xun said that the characters in his works "often have mouths from Zhejiang, faces from Beijing, and clothes from Shanxi, forming a composite character." Ms. Su Xuelin once outlined Ah Q's features from The True Story of Ah Q:</p>
<p>First is cowardice. Ah Q enjoyed arguing and fighting with people, but he always assessed his opponent. He would scold those who were poor at speaking, and beat those who were weak. "When encountering the strong, he dared not resist, comforting himself with words of moderation. But if he had power, and others could do nothing to him, he would be brutal and tyrannical, acting like a despot, never being moderate in his actions."</p>
<p>Second is the "spiritual victory" method. When Ah Q suffered losses in a fight, he would think to himself: "I was beaten by my son after all; the world is no longer what it used to be, sons are actually beating their fathers." And with that, he would be satisfied and return as if he had won.</p>
<p>Third is opportunism. Ah Q originally hated the revolution. But when the tide of the Xinhai Revolution swept into Weizhuang, Ah Q, seeing how exciting it was, also became a revolutionary. But when the Fake Foreign Devil forbade him from participating in the revolution, he thought of going to the yamen to accuse the Fake Foreign Devil of treason, so that the Fake Foreign Devil would be executed along with his entire family.</p>
<p>Fourth are megalomania and a need for self-respect. Ah Q saw very humble people, but he looked down on everyone in Weizhuang. Even when Zhao Taiye's son entered school, Ah Q did not show respect in his mind, believing that his son would be much wealthier than him.</p>
<p>—The True Story of Ah Q and Lu Xun's Artistic Creation</p>
<p>Therefore, Ah Q's nicknames are "Obedient Subject" when he is out of power, "Slave" when he is in power, and "Pauper" or "Comprador" when he is in a foreign setting. Such a great figure of spiritual victory indeed comes from a noble Chinese family. He is a son of the Chinese nation since the Northern Song Dynasty, which I will discuss today.</p>
<p>In the Qing Dynasty, officials would kneel before the emperor, touch their legs, and call themselves "slaves." (In fact, Han officials were not only slaves but also slaves of slaves.) A scholar supposedly filled with "barbarian" spirit—Gu Hongming—once used scholarship to prove that human ankles were born to kneel and be slaves. But history tells us that ancient officials did not kneel or call themselves slaves. Jia Yi and Emperor Wen of Han sat and discussed the Way, and Emperor Wen leaned forward to listen when he heard something that pleased him. Since Zhao Kuangyin became emperor, he changed the old practice of sitting and discussing the Way. The emperor sat and listened to government affairs, and officials could only stand and answer. Until Zhu Yuanzhang became emperor, he revised the rules again, requiring officials to kneel on the golden palace to answer questions during court audiences. Before the Tang and Song dynasties, there were many instances in history of foolish and tyrannical emperors using harsh laws and punishments to kill loyal and good people. But rulers always valued the integrity of scholars and officials and would never insult their dignity (scholars can be killed but not humiliated). It goes without saying that wise rulers treated virtuous people with respect. Starting from the Ming Dynasty, the practice of court floggings began. If the emperor disagreed with something, he would order the guards to drag the court officials down and flog them on their buttocks, stripping them of all dignity. After the Zhengde era of the Ming Dynasty, court floggings to death became commonplace. Therefore, scholars dared not maintain any uprightness and integrity. Instead, they all went to become adopted sons or sworn disciples of Yan Song, Liu Jin, and Wei Zhongxian. If a scholar, like Ruan Da Cheng, a great writer, was willing to worship powerful eunuchs as adopted fathers, then it was certainly easy for him to call himself a slave before the emperor. In the early Qing Dynasty, an elderly official in his seventies knelt for a long time and became unconscious. The eunuch scolded him loudly and prepared to beat him with a stick. A first-rank official of the court had no choice but to endure it. From "sitting and discussing" to "standing and answering," from "standing and answering" to "kneeling and reporting," from "kneeling and reporting" to "receiving court floggings," and finally to "calling oneself a slave," this shocking progress was a major event in the study of slavery.</p>
<p>The above describes the special training in the slavery curriculum; there is also the general training of slaves, which is more important and widespread than special training. The imperial examination system began in the Tang Dynasty. Emperor Taizong of Tang, seeing the triumphant expressions of the newly appointed scholars, felt the pleasure of having "all the heroes in the world within my grasp." After the Northern Song Dynasty, the imperial examination system gradually became complete and meticulous. Cheng Yi knew the terrible nature of this system; he said, "The study for imperial examinations does not suffer from hindering ability, but only from seizing ambition." Indeed, ever since the Ming Dynasty used Eight-legged Essays based on the Four Books to select scholars, the ambition of scholars and officials was gradually eroded by intelligent emperors, and everyone became slaves who did not value integrity or know shame. Please take a look at Ai Nanying's preface to his examination essays. He said that because he was unwilling to end his life as a poor, unrecognized scholar, he had no choice but to endure the tribulations of the examination hall. During the examinations, he was subjected to searches, reprimands, filthy appearance, exposure to the night dew and sun, hot weather, wind, and sand, worse than a prisoner. Everyone endured this disgraceful act, which they could not tell their wives or children, and forced themselves to participate in order to gain official positions. Scholars spent the first half of their lives spinning around in this circle, becoming confused and disoriented, and quickly forgetting that they should have any dignity. In the second half of their lives, they were concerned with gains and losses and pursued profit in the world, paying even less attention to morality! The scholars of the Ming and Qing dynasties, whether they studied Neo-Confucianism, came from the imperial examinations, or indulged in poetry and wine, were all well-trained slave prototypes, earning Emperor Kangxi's derogatory comment: "None of the barbarians are good people!"</p>
<p>Calling oneself an "obedient subject" to foreign races began in the Southern Song Dynasty. Emperor Gaozong of Song was considered an emperor internally, but in reality, he was only a subject of the Jin state. He submitted a memorial to the Jin state, stating: "Your subject Gou—having received your grace, is permitted to guard a border region, and all future generations shall respectfully observe the duties of a subject. Should this alliance be broken, may the spirits punish us, and may we be destroyed, along with our nation." If the emperor calls himself a subject to a foreign race, then it goes without saying that the common people call themselves obedient subjects to foreign races. However, obedient subjects also had different ranks. In the Yuan Dynasty, the obedient subjects from the time of the Liao and Jin dynasties were called Han people, and those who submitted later when the Mongol army conquered Jiangnan were called Southern people. Mongols and Semu people could enjoy important political positions and rights, while Han people were one level lower and could only enjoy them with the Mongol's permission. Southern people had absolutely no opportunity to enjoy them. The only advantage that Southern people had in the Yuan Dynasty was that when Yuan soldiers were captured during the invasion of Japan, Mongols and Han people would be killed, while Southern people could save their lives, but they would be lifelong slaves overseas. The training during the Yuan Dynasty's one hundred years was very effective. When Japanese pirates ravaged the coast during the Ming Dynasty, the people hung "Obedient Subject" flags on every house along the streets when the pirates landed, allowing the pirates to freely plunder their wives, daughters, jade, and silk. This was the result of the "Obedient Subject" training. The "Obedient Subject" flag was even more effective in the Qing Dynasty. When British soldiers captured Ningbo, when the Anglo-French Allied Forces entered Beijing, and when the Three Northeastern Provinces were occupied after the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War, "Obedient Subject" flags could be seen everywhere. During the Boxer Rebellion in the Gengzi year, there were all kinds of "Obedient Subject" flags in the Tianjin-Beijing area, with some claiming to be "Obedient Subjects of Great Britain," some claiming to be "Obedient Subjects of the United States," and some claiming to be "Obedient Subjects of Russia." This further shows that the 600 years of "Obedient Subject" training had been remarkably successful. When Li Hongzhang and Ito Hirobumi were negotiating the Treaty of Shimonoseki, Ito Hirobumi said, "When our army arrived in Fengtian, we found that the Han people were very easy to govern." See, even Ito Hirobumi praised our Chinese obedient subjects! There is slave training at the top and obedient subject training at the bottom; "slave" plus "obedient subject" is the soul of our Ah Q! Friends, let me tell you: Ah Q's father is called "Traditional Eastern Spirit."</p>
<h3 id="e195">The Suicide (3) <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>— Qiandong</p>
<p>"Yes," Dr. Lan responded, as if understanding, still dragging his feet.</p>
<p>The pastor laughed again, like a child. He put the notebook into his leather bag, and his triumphant guttural sounds echoed again in the emergency room:</p>
<p>"Lu Changsheng! Yes, I still remember his appearance. Long hair, long face, sunken cheeks, deep beard, and eyes like those of a dead fish, always looking up blankly. He also has the yellow skin characteristic of Chinese people."</p>
<p>The pastor looked at Dr. Lan, wanting to know if the other party admired his memory. He saw him lowering his head, pacing back and forth as if acknowledging it, and he called out even more happily, proudly showing that he was a remarkable person:</p>
<p>"I can hold the psychology of a suicide in the palm of my hand. A suicide must be a strong man, at least in spirit. And also someone with a desire to live ten times stronger than ordinary people. All such people have a series of amazing histories, because a very heavy force has tempered them into such a state, which is just like moths flying toward lamps. They all lack a Jesus to lead them, so they have gone down the wrong path. If they were to walk back from this road, they would definitely become the people most capable of repenting of the sins of humanity, because they have walked closer to the 'Day of Judgment' than we have. And at that time, he will know that life is precious, so he will use the force of a moth fluttering to repent, and he will become a faithful follower of Jesus. I have already successfully tested this theory on Lu Changsheng. When I talked about the Last Judgment, when I talked about the sins of his previous life, how frightened he was! When I talked about the resurrection of Jesus, when I talked about how honored Christians would be on Judgment Day, how fascinated he was! When he left the hospital yesterday, I deliberately gave him a dollar. I thought if I did this, I would have him in the palm of my hand forever, right here." (Waving a fist holding a handkerchief.) "He said he would come tomorrow. I believe he will come tomorrow. I want him to do anything, and he will do it. I might even tell him to go commit suicide again, and he might obey. I believe even more that he is already one of my fingers. I have a fantasy that a great man's fingers must not be just five on each hand, otherwise wouldn't his fist be as small as an ordinary person's when clenched? One dollar, only one dollar, equivalent to only twenty cents in US dollars! Dr. Lan, you must save the life of these twenty cents, we should have such fingers growing on our hands! Dr. Lan, I came down for this matter, I..."</p>
<p>He saw that Dr. Lan was ignoring him and had walked out. He stopped talking and glared angrily at his back. However, after a while, he also heard the ambulance coming back.</p>
<p>The pastor stood at the door, moving the handkerchief used to wipe his nose down a little, so that his mouth was also covered. The patient arrived, the worker pushed the stretcher, the nurse held gauze, cotton, and other things, and Dr. Lan followed behind.</p>
<p>The pastor trembled and squeezed the handkerchief tighter. He dared not approach the patient, but only looked at Dr. Lan's eyes from a distance, because from there he could see everything about the patient.</p>
<p>Dr. Lan turned his head and met the pastor's eyes. The pastor was startled.</p>
<p>"Pastor," Dr. Lan said with a mocking look, "this person is useless. He ate Lysol, and even his intestines are probably rotten. But come and take a look at how we can cure him?"</p>
<p>"No, no, Dr. Lan," the pastor shook his head tightly, covering his mouth, "Your words will never be wrong, I don't need to see."</p>
<h3 id="e196">Suburban Morning (Middle) <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>— Hu Yifan</p>
<p>Woo… Woo… Woo Woo…</p>
<p>The factory whistle can be heard faintly, signaling the first shift. Some silk-reeling women, old women, and young children in the countryside quickly swallow their last mouthful of cold rice and hurriedly pick up their small lunch baskets to go to work.</p>
<p>Those rushing from the side streets are all night-shift workers.</p>
<p>"Ah Jinzi, what's happening at the factory? Is it really true that we'll be working fewer days starting tomorrow?"  Lost eyes focus on a middle-aged woman with gold teeth.</p>
<p>"Did someone tell you a joke? Ask Zhou from the factory. They know everything. That's what they all say."  She answers with a mocking smile, pointing her finger.</p>
<p>"It's a disaster for the poor! A disaster for the poor!"</p>
<p>"We used to work five days a week, and everyone complained. Now, we barely have three days of work. What's the point of working at the factory? We're going to starve!"</p>
<p>"Really a disaster for the poor! A disaster for the poor!"</p>
<p>A chaotic chorus of voices shouts out the most painful sighs.  Those unemployed men staying home to care for the children still rely on their wives' wages to survive!</p>
<p>"Gendi, don't cry. Your mother will bring back something good to eat."</p>
<p>He chews on the last mouthful of rice, clears the table, and tries to pacify his child.</p>
<p>Laborers and rickshaw pullers crawl out of their bungalows and thatched huts, like hungry wolves, rushing towards the city.</p>
<p>Only those bigwigs who make their living in the city—the nouveau riche, police officers, and foreign assistants, the Western-suit tailors, and the salesmen from foreign firms—swagger down the road.</p>
<p>They can't forget their trade jargon: pidgin English.</p>
<p>"Hello... where go?"</p>
<p>"Hello... go office?"</p>
<p>"Oh oh, yes—yes!"</p>
<p>The sun is about to rise above the horizon, but its silhouette is not yet visible.</p>
<p>The northeastern corner of the sky is covered in thick, dark clouds. It seems it won't be a sunny day after all.</p>
<p>Caw, caw, caw, flocks of crows fly in the sky, and bats dart back and forth in the woods.</p>
<p>Thus, sighs are heard everywhere in the fields:</p>
<p>"What terrible weather!"</p>
<p>"Heaven is punishing the poor!"</p>
<p>"Floods in the first half of the year, and in the second half..."</p>
<p>"Master (Note) has no eyes!"</p>
<p>A somber expression is revealed on the faces of all the laborers.  Lost pupils stare blankly at the dim sky.  A cool breeze blows on the women's headscarves.</p>
<p>Everyone is sweating, hanging their heads, and sighing.</p>

<h3 id="e198">Returning from Watching the Tide <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>— Long Zaitian</p>
<p>Autumn is already deep. The gloomy sky occasionally sprinkles light showers!  But it is said that the more overcast the weather, the higher the tide. So, I finally hopped on the streetcar to Haining.</p>
<p>Although it's said that it's cool but not yet cold, I didn't prepare enough clothes for this trip. Plus, the streetcar sped along the wide asphalt road outside Qingtai Gate, and sitting against the wind, a chill seeped into my legs. It was truly quite unbearable, and I felt the desolation of autumn even more keenly.</p>
<p>According to the schedule, the tide wouldn't arrive until 1:20 PM. To warm up and have a place to sit, I ordered a pot of tea in the courtyard of a place called Central Tea House. It was unimaginably dilapidated and desolate. The low buildings were so dark under the dim daylight that they needed to be lit.  Being there, I felt an indescribable sense of oppression!  Yet, it was still the fanciest teahouse around, with deformed rattan chairs bound with wood or bamboo and glass cups covered in fingerprints...  It was indeed the "center" of the area.</p>
<p>I couldn't help but wander around nearby. Above the lotus pond stood an antique stone archway. On both sides lived coolies. A sow, majestic as an elephant, waddled with dignity. Geese and chickens scattered in a skirmish line. Several coffins were lined up inside the gate... It evoked a strange feeling in me, and I didn't dare go any further.</p>
<p>The number of people going out of the city gradually increased. Some were refined-looking, twirling binoculars. I followed them.</p>
<p>There were five or six hundred spectators on the stone dam. There were also snake-like women with wooden-faced young men in Western clothes. But it was said that on the 18th, the entire dam would be packed with people. Today was truly a small affair.</p>
<p>In the distance, beneath a few hazy green hills, a white line gradually enlarged on my retina. The sound of drums, like a battle drum, pounded, accelerating everyone's pulse. At that moment, a local standing next to me told me an interesting legend:</p>
<p>"The tide here used to be silent. Once, Emperor Qiantang was carrying a load of salt, walking on Zhe Mountain, when the tide washed up and overturned the salt. Emperor Qiantang was furious and scolded it, 'Why didn't you warn me?' From then on, the tide would sound whenever it passed Zhe Mountain. At the same time, the water also became salty, but outside Zhe Mountain, it is still freshwater. That's because of Emperor Qiantang's load of salt."</p>
<p>Perhaps he had more to say, but I wasn't in the mood to listen. The mast of the first ship in front of Little Pudu swayed up and down, and snow-white waves five or six feet high swept across in unison! The magnificent spectacle of that surging torrent, besides the inner experience, is truly impossible to describe even a fraction of it in existing words. The heads of the spectators moved restlessly with the advance of the tide.  Many sandboats, whose hulls were previously hidden, suddenly rose and were level with the shore.</p>
<p>But it was also at this time that I saw an unforgettable tragedy!</p>
<p>These sandboats are specifically waiting for the tide to transport goods from this shore to the other. When the tide recedes, they return from the other side, whether loaded or empty. When the tide rises, they sail from this side. They do this all year round.  They get four or five cents for transporting each bag of rice and five cents for each live sheep... Precisely because they need to wait for the tide, as soon as the tide comes in, the workers on the shore rush to throw the goods to be transported—rice, cotton, soybean cakes, sheep…—onto the boat in a frenzy. This scene makes us think of the pirate life of the 18th century. And the faces of those coolies are enough to make us realize that the arhats in the Buddhist halls are not illusory statues, but their models. After exerting themselves, the muscles on their backs and shoulders contracted spasmodically, and the black hair on their chests opened and closed with the rapid breathing of their hearts... In a few minutes, the entire boat was full, and then they raised the huge sail.</p>
<p>At the same time, a crowd suddenly appeared—old, young, strong men and women, especially old women—carrying bags, baskets, or mats… and desperately scrambled onto the boat. They were all crowded together on the rice sacks in the shade of the sail. I had thought they were the families of the workers on the sandboats, but after talking with a merchant who was probably the boat owner, I learned that they were all passengers, paying two dimes per person to be taken to Nansha. At this moment, another strong man prostrated himself on the stone steps—because there weren't proper stone steps, just unevenly stacked stones that could barely be used as footholds—preparing to jump onto the sandboat that had already left the shore. But, it was truly tragic! A surge of the wave squeezed the boat back, and he—this strong man—became a huge meat cushion between the boat and the stone shore! At that moment, his desperate screams were like the tearing of silk! It shattered the satisfied hearts of everyone who had been watching the tide. So, the tide-watchers unconsciously gathered around.  All that could be seen was a large patch of blood on his pants, his whole body desperately clutching the stone shore, his eyes fixed on his nose, like a haunting ghost! The women scattered. I don't remember what I felt at that moment, just staring blankly.  But the merchant who seemed to be the boat owner was still cursing, "Why did you have to come here to die! The tide doesn't care about emotions, why were you standing on the stone shore..." He took out two "big" pots and ordered someone to buy white pepper!</p>
<p>The spectators, without closure, dispersed.  I numbly dragged my weary legs along with them, but a cruel shadow had been added to my uneasy heart!</p>
<p>Really, who would have thought that such a vibrant man would end his life in such a flash? (The End)</p>

<h3 id="e199">Strange Tale of Making Propaganda for a God <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>— Xing An</p>
<p>According to a Fuzhou dispatch reported yesterday, the provincial government recently ordered the Public Security Bureau to destroy the statues in the Qixing Nai Temple in Tongtianjing within the city and seal the temple door. The so-called Qixing Nai is said to be a goddess who can protect children, and she is worshiped by the general lower class. As a result, some people have used divine authority as a source of profit. All those who worship Qixing Nai as foster parents for their children must pay a incense fee of one yuan per person every year. There are more than 8,000 registered foster children, so they can get more than 8,000 yuan, which is pocketed by the temple directors, Mr. Lin, and others. Later, some people in the community believed that these people were using the gods to collect money and should be banned. So, this year, Mr. Lin and others came up with a strange idea, announcing to the community that Qixing Nai admired Qi Jiguang, a famous general of the Ming Dynasty, for his loyalty and martial spirit, and was willing to marry him. They also consulted with Qi Jiguang's descendants and agreed to move the wooden puppet in Qi Jiguang's ancestral hall to Tongtianjing, while Qixing Nai moved to the scripture hall. The intention was to raise the status of Qixing Nai so that they could continue to use the gods to defraud money. The community was in an uproar for a while, and everyone said that it was a desecration of Qi Gong's personality. When the matter was heard by the provincial authorities, the police of the county bureau destroyed more than 200 large and small statues in the territory and threw them into the river the other day.</p>
<p>This is truly an unprecedented strange tale. Mr. Lin and others, directors of the Qixing Nai Temple in Tongtianjing, actually came up with the bizarre idea of ​​forcibly marrying Qi Jiguang, a famous general of the Ming Dynasty, to a Qixing Nai of unknown origin in order to collect money by using the gods. This is not only absurd, but also extremely grotesque and ridiculous. Originally, superstitious forces are widespread among the Chinese people. The general charlatans who rely on the gods to make a living can do whatever clever tricks they can, as long as there is an opportunity to take advantage of and profit from it. It goes without saying that the gods' birthdays must be lively. If the place is not peaceful, a welcoming god parade must be held to suppress evil ghosts. Sometimes the incense burner in the temple accidentally catches fire, which means that the Lord wants to go out and patrol the territory. In these various events, the residents, who call themselves pious believers, must donate some money to show their sincerity. Thus, the charlatans' labor of running around has a price. The directors, Mr. Lin and others, of the Qixing Nai Temple can earn more than 8,000 yuan a year. If they are banned, wouldn't they be wasting a lot of money for nothing? No wonder they want to move Qi Gong's idol to Tongtianjing to raise the status of Qixing Nai in order to continue their fraudulent behavior. What is ridiculous is still the ignorance of these more than 8,000 registered foster children who worship Qixing Nai. Without their stupid actions, the charlatans, Mr. Lin and others, would have no way to use their skills. Now the provincial government has destroyed all the more than 200 large and small statues in the territory and closed its temple doors, which is indeed a gratifying thing and is extremely effective in breaking superstition. However, it is heard that the authorities in Fujian adhere to the policy of not hindering good customs and may temporarily follow local customs. Therefore, welcoming god parades, and extravagance of gods' birthdays, and even spirit writing and shamanistic dancing are not prohibited. Although this measure has its own inevitable reasons, the tricks played by the Qixing Nai Temple this time may not be caused by the authorities' excessive tolerance of superstition. Therefore, the provincial government must pay considerable attention to the bad customs in the local area in the future.</p>

<p>— Ming</p>
<p>My hometown is a famous mountainous province. My hometown is a small town along the Liujiang River. This Liujiang River flows down along the mountains in a zigzag manner. Although it does not have the steepness of the Wuxia Gorges in Sichuan, the high mountains on both sides and the grotesque stone stalagmites, like the turbulent river like a waterfall, are enough to shock the boatmen.</p>
<p>On a day when the late spring flowers were falling, I escaped from that old and dilapidated family and took a folk boat sailing on the Liujiang River to find my vague and unknowable future upstream of the Liujiang River.</p>
<p>I was crouching in the six- or seven-foot-wide, ten-foot-long cabin with a feeling of terror and curiosity, like a fugitive. The boat shed from the cabin board to the top of the cabin was only two or three feet high, so I could not lift my head. One side of the cabin was carrying grain, groceries, and untanned cowhide. The cowhide exuded a foul smell evaporated by the lime and sun, making my head swell.</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>After a burst of gongs, the boat moved and sailed. The boat was going upstream along the river, against the current. At first, it used oars to row the boat, and then the boat ran to the river bank to pull the cable. Under the shining of the late spring sun, the river was sparkling with golden waves. The high mountains on both sides turned green with the breath of spring. The mountains and forests were showing a lush green color. In the bushes and thorny grass of these high mountains, the cries of partridges and turtledoves were rippling, bringing a melody of spring's sadness and melancholy. The warm and unrestrained spring breeze that made people intoxicated and could ignite the emotions of parting slowly blew,夹着一些野花的香味和船夫們拉纜時哼出那被生活壓榨所發出深沉悽壯的歌聲，在我這個初出門的旅人胸中織成一種悵惘悲喜的感情。</p>
<p>The boat was moving very slowly because the water was rapid and there were many shoals. It took an hour to pass one shoal. After passing the shoal, the boatmen had to have a meal to fill their stomachs like machines adding coal. It was not until dusk that they reached half of the journey. In front of us, the night was slowly unfolding, and the turbulent Longmen Shoal with its crisscrossing rocks and splashing rapids.</p>
<p>The sky was gradually darkening, and the faces of the boatmen also darkened at the same time. The cable was also retracted, and the boatmen all returned to the boat. On their dark faces, there was a resolute and solemn attitude of fighting. Then, a dozen of them picked up bamboo poles and propped the boat forward pole by pole. The boat slowly approached the Longmen Shoal. The mountains on both sides of the shoal were very high, making the shoal even darker. The boat seemed to be driving into a deep valley. The jagged stone stalagmites rising from the shoal bed and the raging waves and flying foam from the rapids hitting the reefs showed the danger of the rivers in this natural world.</p>
<p>I walked out of the cabin. It was time to go up the shoal. The boatmen began to use bamboo poles to prop up the bottom of the shoal, put the bamboo poles against their shoulders, and desperately put all their energy on the bamboo poles, climbing from the bow to the stern step by step, making a "yiya yiya" sound, screaming as if they were being whipped. The boat moved forward inch by inch for a quarter of an hour. When they reached the most dangerous Longmen on the shoal, the river was only two feet wide, and on both sides were stone stalagmites and reefs, like big turtles with their backs arched. When entering Longmen, the boatmen's shouts became even more tragic. The raging waves of the rapids rushed down on the boat like a mountain, and the boatmen desperately propped the boat forward with bamboo poles against the reefs, forming a magnificent picture of humans fighting nature. However, the boat's progress was very slow, and that reef was always next to our boat. The boatmen were shouting, struggling, and resisting the power of the rapids. At this time, a boatman in the front on the left, the bamboo pole he was propping on the reef suddenly slipped, and the bamboo pole went into the air. Following that, the boatman also lost the thing he was relying on, and he shook and plunged into the river with a "bang." Just right, his head hit the reef, and his skull burst. He sank into the water silently, and a stream of blood rose with the foam. At this time, the boatmen shouted wildly. One or two of them pulled out the bamboo poles they were propping and stretched them to the side of the person in distress. Then, the boat lost its resistance and shook violently. The boat boss shouted from the stern of the boat,</p>
<p>"Damn it, don't let go, prop up the bamboo poles tightly, if you let go, it's over!"</p>
<p>The boatmen also knew that if they let go, the boat would be hit by the rapids and kiss the reef. In this way, the boat would be broken by the reef, and the boat would be finished. So, the boatmen grimaced and propped the bamboo poles against their shoulders, under the tension without tears and the pressure of nature, watching their partners bleed and drift away with the raging waves.</p>
<p>After two hours of struggle, the boat climbed up the Longmen Shoal. Darkness had already sealed off the shoal. The boatmen's faces were gloomy with sad tears, looking at the dangerous shoal, never seeing their comrades again. Only the sound of the raging waves hitting the reefs was like the sound of beating war drums. This sound seemed to be mixed with the tragic cries and sobs of the unfortunate person. From the dark forests and thorny grass valleys of the high mountains on both sides, there were also intermittent cries of turtledoves and partridges. This is the first picture of the tragedy of life I saw on the way to becoming a master.</p>

<p>— Yang Zhongshuo</p>
<p>The place where I live is extremely quiet, with weeping willows, greenery, and a clear spring.</p>
<p>Not far from where I live, there is an ancient temple with a long history. The loud sound of the evening bell has awakened my dreams for several years. I have been able to break free from the shackles of reality, be content with my fate, and live this leisurely life in peace and tranquility. In the final analysis, I am still fascinated by that bell.</p>
<p>Because it has not been repaired for many years, this temple is showing signs of collapse. The dilapidated walls, the broken tiles, and the mottled walls all indicate that it is so old that it has been forgotten by people.</p>
<p>However, the antique mottled color fascinated me. Every evening, in the sound of wooden fish bells and drums, I quietly walked into this temple.</p>
<p>Because I come every day, the monks all recognize me. They are mostly humble and polite when we meet, and very kind.</p>
<p>The abbot is a middle-aged man around forty years old, with a face that is full but slightly thin. From his actions and manners, he has the qualities of a scholar. He asks me with a smiling face what I do every day when he sees me.</p>
<p>"Read books and practice calligraphy, nothing else," I always answer him with this sentence. But I have never seen him have the slightest expression of impatience. Sometimes he even smiles with his eyes narrowed, even though my answer is so stereotyped and has never changed.</p>
<p>When I first went there, everyone was a little reserved. Later, as we gradually became familiar with each other, there was no pretense in our conversations.</p>
<p>Once, I went to look for him again. After asking me what I did as usual, he began to tell me about his past. He said that he used to be an officer in charge of troops, a director of a tax collection office, and an active figure in the political vortex, which made me feel very surprised. How could a person who lived in an environment of wine, meat, and extravagance put down the butcher knife and break away from the prosperous reality to live this desolate life? This cannot but be considered a miracle. However, this miracle is not too strange. What is strange is: since he has become a monk, he should have his six senses purified and wholeheartedly convert to my Buddha. However, he also told me that although he had become a monk, he still drank alcohol and ate meat. When he was in the mood, he would also invite three or four friends to go to the nearby brothel to have tea.</p>
<p>If these words were heard by those moralists, I really don't know to what extent they would scold him. However, I found his frank and straightforward confession very cute.</p>
<p>I once asked him why he wanted to be a monk. He said without hesitation, and very cleverly, "If a person is buried in an environment of sensual pleasures and extravagance all his life, what is the difference between him and a maggot in a dung heap? The reason why I have the heart to leave my family and wife and regard wealth and fame as floating clouds is because I am not willing to be a maggot!"</p>
<p>I was moved by his remarks. I sympathized with him, admired him, and was even more deeply impressed by his brilliant insights. I almost wanted to abandon my current life immediately and hide in that unfathomable and mysterious empty door.</p>
<p>However, after I expressed my wishes, he opposed it again and said, "You are still young after all, and you have not tasted the stench of the dung heap thoroughly. Moreover, this era does not seem to need a passive lifestyle. The fragmentation of the country depends on you young people to sew up. The so-called reincarnation and nirvana in Buddhism are just admonitions to persuade people to do good and warn the world. You young people have not committed the crime of deceiving the world and stealing the country, nor have you done anything against your conscience, so why bother to do this? It is not in vain to be young and to be passive. I personally cannot agree, and your family and friends will not allow it!"</p>
<p>Recently, I have not been to that ancient temple for several days. When I am alone and bored, I will use my thoughts on those illusory images. "To be a dung maggot, or to transcend oneself?" This question often swirls in my mind.</p>
<p>A sudden news made me stunned. Yesterday evening, I re-entered the ancient temple in the sound of wooden fish bells and drums. But the abbot was gone. At first, I thought he had gone to the brothel with three or four friends. Later, according to another monk, he - the abbot - had been appointed by a province to be a county magistrate. After hearing the monk's words, I smiled bitterly with my mouth pursed.</p>
<p>From this time on, my "preconceptions" began to shake. I realized that everywhere in this world is a dung heap!</p>
<p>The abbot was unable to escape reality after all and still had to wriggle in the dung heap! It is still a maggot in the dung heap!</p>
<h3 id="e202">The Monkey Handler <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>— Yan</p>
<p>After the store across the street was demolished, the plot of rubble lay barren for more than half a year without reconstruction. Rumor had it that two leaseholders were discovered on this two-mu-plus plot, leading to unresolved litigation. Another account said the landowner lacked the capital for reconstruction, so this open space became a venue for miscellaneous entertainments.</p>
<p>My bedroom faces this open space diagonally. Since there were no buildings rebuilt, the view, though at an angle, was unobstructed. Returning from the company, it was just as the sun was setting in the west, which was also the busiest time for the open space. There were peep shows, boxing matches, monkey handlers, and many vendors gathering here, creating a small market. Schoolchildren returning home and lower-class women used it as their entertainment venue, and business seemed to be thriving. If, as one account said, the landowner lacked the capital to rebuild, dividing the land into sections and collecting tolls would have yielded considerable profits in half a year.</p>
<p>Taking advantage of my window, I would idly lean on the windowsill to watch the bustle. Because the monkey handler's performance area was closest to my view, and his circle of spectators was particularly crowded, I would inexplicably watch the monkey's antics with the same tireless fascination as those spectators. Sometimes, when I returned home a little later, they had already dispersed, and I felt a sense of lingering longing.</p>
<p>Humans evolved from apes, so it's not surprising that these monkeys can perform little tricks. I am no longer in the mindset of childhood, watching the monkey's jumping and finding joy in it, especially since it's always the same few tricks every day. What I couldn't forget was the monkey handler: his temples were already gray, at least in his late fifties. He was all alone, without a helper, and the monkey was probably his only companion. He beat the gong himself, greeted the audience himself, sang tuneless melodies himself, and directed the monkey to perform himself. He was hunchbacked, and under such strenuous work, he often panted, sweated, and still tried to keep his eyes on the audience, fearing they would become dissatisfied and leave. Every day, he collected money twice, bowing to each spectator, which made his figure even smaller. Whether the amount was sufficient, the two collections were full enough, I imagine, to cover his and his only companion monkey's food and lodging for the day.</p>
<p>But these past few days, the miscellaneous entertainment venues in the open space have dwindled, and the old monkey handler has also disappeared. I asked a child who played in the open space every day, and the child replied that he didn't know. Today, however, I encountered this pair of interdependent companions in our alley. He was still wearing that tattered, multi-layered garment, beating the gong alone. The audience was naturally not as large as when he was in the open space. As I entered the alley, he was holding the gong to collect money. I casually threw a few coins to him. He bowed habitually, mechanically like the monkey performing, feigning an awkward smile, and repeatedly thanked me in a Shandong accent.</p>
<p>After collecting the money, he gave a general bow and led the monkey away. I originally wanted to ask him a few questions, but seeing how laboriously he walked, I didn't dare to speak. But someone in the alley had already asked him the reason for not being in the open space these past few days. It was because someone with authority on that road demanded a toll from him, and he was driven away because he couldn't afford this unexpected expense.</p>

<p>The General Society of the Chinese Red Cross, in view of the severe floods in various provinces, has specially organized a fundraising committee, approved by the Ministry of Interior, to engage in raising relief funds, in order to distribute them as soon as possible. And in view of the increasingly urgent world situation, in order to train rescuers and reserve rescue materials, it is even more proactive in soliciting members this year. In addition to the Level 1-5 members, there is also a supporting certificate, priced at one yuan per certificate. Soliciting compatriots across the country, each person bearing one yuan, to fund rescue work, in order to seek security guarantees for humanity. This matter is of great importance and relies entirely on the enthusiastic donations of the public. In order to expand publicity, in addition to the obligation of each radio station to report daily, a special program will be broadcast every Sunday on Foyin Radio Station. This time, on the evening of September 29th, starting at 8:15 PM, the last special program will still be broadcast on Foyin Radio Station, with speeches by Secretary-General Cao Yunxiang, Secretary Gan Shuhan, Propaganda Director Shen Jintao, and guest Ms. Xiong Saiying. We have requested Mr. Zhang Shichuan, Zhou Jianyun, and Dong Tianya to ask Film Queen Hu Die and all the male and female stars of the Star Film Company, such as Gao Zhanfei, Xu Lai, Yan Yuexian, Ye Qiuxin, Huang Naishuang, Tang Jie, Zhu Qiuhen, Gu Lanjun, and Shu Xiuwen, to broadcast the latest songs. Gu Meijun, Wang Huijuan, Jing Liting, Wang Mengshi, Tan Zhiyuan, Tang Wei, and Wang Jiting will sing Peking Opera. Foyin Radio Station originally had 500 watts, but now it has temporarily added power, so that both domestic and foreign listeners can hear it. The detailed program will be disclosed by this newspaper this Sunday.</p>
<p>The Yuexing Singing Society will begin broadcasting the latest songs next month and is now recruiting several female members. Those who are interested in noble songs can send a detailed resume with a personal photo to No. 8, Bailinan Branch Road, to the society.</p>

<h3 id="e208">Lu Shi Establishes Shanghai Drama Film Research Institute <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>Lu Shi was previously hired by the Performing Arts Experimental Institute as its director. However, due to the internal reorganization of the institute, Lu Shi also announced his withdrawal. It is now reported that after Lu Shi's departure from the institute, he is now actively establishing a slightly different institution, reportedly named the "Shanghai Drama Film Research Institute." The scope will be further expanded, and famous figures will be hired as faculty members. Once the arrangements are in place, the establishment and enrollment announcement will be made in the newspaper. (Sun Yimin, 465 Dongxi Huade Road, Hongkou: The above text is a news release sent to us and does not mean that the Shanghai Drama Film Research Institute is affiliated with the Shen Bao. If you want to register, etc., please send the photos directly after it announces its establishment. This publication cannot do it for you.
