<h3 id="c29">一萬萬元金融公債與工商業之救濟 <a href="#c29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>— 立</p>
<p>我國對外貿易。年年入超。現銀不斷外流。此爲中國國民經濟衰落之主因。而去年美國收買白銀。更使鉅量現銀外流。引起金融界之惶慮。又爲促成今日經濟恐慌之近因。在今日恐慌情形之下。銀根緊急。放欵收縮。工商業因戚受莫大之痛苦。遂不得不紛起呼籲政府。加以救濟。救濟之道。端在標本同治。言治標。則目下唯有增厚銀行資力。俾銀行得充分放欵於工商業。以安定市面。治本則自以獎勵輸出。减少入超爲要著。今中政會爲救濟恐慌起見。特於本月二十日通過孔財長之提案二件。一爲發行金融公債一萬萬元。以增加中央·中國·交通三銀行資本。藉以活潑金融。使工商業有所挹注。一爲减免出口稅與裁撤海關轉口稅。以减輕商品成本。便利貨物流通。洵不失爲對於治標治本兼籌並顧之一種救濟方策。</p>
<p>對於恐慌之救濟。最近滬上各銀行頗能羣策羣力。經營各種放欵。以救工商業者之困苦。此實一種可喜之現象。如最近銀行公會會員銀行中國·交通·上海·中南。大陸。金城·鹽業。墾業。綢業·國貨·通商·國華·四明·浙江興業·浙江實業·及中國實業等特籌組銀團。會同中央銀行。舉辦工商業信用小借欵。其於市面之維持。裨益自非淺鮮。惟以所放數目不大。恐尙不免有杯水車薪之憾。况近來各省市之借欵。均向滬銀行商籌。滬銀行雖有心多多放欵。而在此艱苦之際。亦殊不免有心餘力拙之感。今政府當局决議發行金融公債一萬萬元。以三千萬元撥充中央銀行資本。二千五百萬元撥充中國銀行資本。一千萬元撥充交通銀行資本。餘欵三千五百萬元則撥中央銀行爲活動周轉之資。殆卽爲欲增加銀行放欵之力量。蓋俟此項公債發行後。中央銀行之實收資本。將由二千萬元增至五千萬元。中國銀行之實收資本。將由二千四百七十一萬二千二百元增至四千九百七十一萬二千二百元。交通銀行之實收資本。將由八百七十一萬五千六百元增至一千八百七十一萬五千六百元。三行對於本市及各地必要之放欵。當能比較應付裕如。此工商各界所以對於此項公債大都表示歡迎也。</p>
<p>此項金融公債。雖尙待立法院之議决。與中交兩行股東大會之通過接受。然事旣有益於市面之救　。且汪院長又曾鄭重聲明。「金融公債之發行。其目的在增加中央及中國交通三行之資本。藉以活潑金融。使工商業有所挹注。絕無縱橫捭闔之意存乎其間。」（見二十一日中央社南京電）當爲一般國民所了解。將來中交兩行。倘能再酌加商股。則資力更厚。其於救濟工業。振興市面。自必益能副社會之期望也。</p>
<p>雖然。金融公債之發行。尙屬治標之辦法。關於治本之方策。如中政會通過之减免出口稅。與裁撤海關轉口稅我人亦望其早日見諸實行。蓋治標與治本必項兼籌並顧。方足使恐慌之根本原因逐漸解除也。</p>

<p>此間英人各界以爲討論之主旨、乃在交換意見、而非謀切實之妥協、聞德國外交家擬分所談事件爲兩部、一爲有交換條件而可就緒者、如天空公約與海軍事伴問題是、一爲極難獲得妥協者、如强迫軍役東洛迦諾公約與奧國問題是、殖民地問題及德國遵凡爾賽和約割讓與立陶宛之米美爾、似不致討論及之、蓋前者將令談話益見複雜、西門聘問之宗旨、以歐洲安全爲限、不欲兼及此事、米美爾則英人各界視爲國聯應處理之事也、</p>
<p>東歐公約　最感棘手</p>
<p>關於天空公約一事、不致發生困難，因德國亦亟欲成立之也、海軍事伴亦然、德國今日對此之野心、已不若往日之甚矣、據非官塲意見、德國有海軍四十萬噸、連同潛艇若干艘、即可知足、而最感困難者、厥為東洛迦諾公約是、據某要員語路透訪員稱、目下互助條欵、似萬難接受、又謂德國似不甘放棄在奧之利益、希特勒本人尤注重、至於强迫軍役、新軍人數尙未確定、當有談判之可能云、（二十五日路透電）</p>
<p>德國觀念　仇視蘇聯</p>
<p>（柏林）此間英國人士之消息靈通者、以爲希特勒現正作大規模之努力、謀使英國落入德國之政治圈套、蓋一般人猶能憶及前首相路易喬治之秘書樂相勛爵與麥唐納首相之親信阿倫勛爵曾於本年一月往訪柏林、會晤德國政府要人、携歸報告、詳述德國之政治密謀、此項報吿迄未發表、內容係陳述德國之主要觀念、在於仇視蘇聯、認蘇聯爲道德上之深仇大敵、苟如與蘇俄妥協、實屬違犯「破壞文化之罪惡」、此係希特勒親口所作語、因此希特勒甚或將提議訂結英美德三國公約、以相互保障外來之侵略、因欲表明此種公約、無反對法國之意、幷擬明白承認德國西方邊界及德國與波蘭·捷克·比利時·荷蘭各國現行邊界、如是則可使英國迴避東歐互助公約、而使蘇聯在實際上陷於孤立、至就多瑙河公約而論、則德國擬接受承認奧國之獨立、幷不提出保留、主張「奧國人民如願歸併德國、應使其有明白表示意志之機會」、其意若日、卽德國國社黨之活動、未可認爲干涉奧國內政、正如奧國內衛團之活動、未可認爲干涉意國內政也、</p>
<p>陸海空軍　平等要求</p>
<p>除以上各節外、德國復要求三事、（一）德國軍備應與歐洲陸軍最强大之國家相等、（二）德國空軍軍力與英國對等、但以英國空軍與歐洲最强大國家空軍相等爲條件、（三）德國應有海軍四十萬噸、關於最後一點、據樂相勳爵觀察、希特勒似非不可讓步、僅要求德國海軍得掌波羅的海之覇權、而任英國支配各海洋、亦可滿足矣、此項計劃係自英國方面所探悉、此次英德談話中、希特勒所提出之計劃、在實質上有無變更、現尙不能斷定、然有一事應加聲明者、則此種計劃英國外部發言人認爲不能接受是也、（二十五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>談話前途　英方樂觀</p>
<p>柏林英方官員對於英德談話之結果、現具有謹愼的樂觀精神、惟曾切實聲明、討論之目的非在提出建議、亦非提出讓步、不過欲探詢消息耳、德方則以爲希特勒之主旨、在使英代表西門艾登了解德國目前之外交政策、尤其爲德國對蘇俄之懷疑、蓋德國今有精神上與政治上之理由、視蘇俄爲西方列强不能與之和諧之大敵也、蘇俄足爲其他西方列强之危害實無疑義、强有力之德國、足爲防禦此種危害之歐洲最上屛障、此在今日德國外交談判中實佔一重要部分、德國視此爲堅强理由、今日似將提出於英代表前、</p>
<p>樂觀之觀察家數人曾提出英德美締結相互擔保條約、而承認德國東西部界綫、以陷蘇俄於孤立地位問題、但有人切實聲明、此種想像、目前不能獲政界之贊助、德國各報似亦具有樂觀、今日德意志日報曾言「會議已在吉兆中開始」、（二十五日路透電）</p>

<p>（倫敦）外相西門與德國元首希特勒覿面在卽、各報論調均特別重視下列二點、第一德國有承認條約神聖性之必要、蓋組織和平機構、此乃不可缺之條件也、第二外相西門使節、係屬有限制者、此行雖甚重要、但未能採取堅定不移之决議、每日電聞報　稱、「外相西門掌璽大臣艾登非欲在英德兩國之間討價還價、；亦非英法意三國聯合陣綫之全權大使、西門外相自稱、所負使命僅屬探訪性質、恍若逐層探測地質、以便深入國際集體制度最深之一層、此在德國方面、則國社黨領袖之中卽其最倔强者、亦未必期望在前次施放炸彈之後、僅僅一旬之隔、再發出一驚人之霹靂也、吾人以爲依照英國所定之進行程序、平心靜氣加以考慮、則英法意三國間意見之一致、不難回復、而日前巴黎談話完畢後所發表之公報、尤足使最後之杞憂爲之一掃而空、至勸告德國回返國聯會之任務、則當繫於强毅之精神、而以實在情形爲歸宿、斷非花言巧語所能濟事、蓋德國於緩和時局所能盡力之處、宜出之以心悅誠服、而非可强制致之、但對於凡爾賽和約打擊之舉、如十日前之所爲者、今後决不可再度出之也」云、（二十五日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>江海關上年派駐閩海關巡艦海和號、今次自滬赴閩、行至途中、因遇霧走錨、而致觸礁、大槪情形、已駐昨報、茲再將詳情探誌如下、</p>
<p>自滬赴閩</p>
<p>江海關派駐福建閩海關之巡艦海和號、載量爲一千二百噸、艦身係由高昌廟江南船塢承造、在去年海關建造五艦時、該艦即爲其中一艦、其任務係派駐沿海各岸之走漏商貨及偸稅等事、該艦落成後、奉海關命、派往閩海一帶巡查、艦長爲英人浦赫特氏、艦內共有官佐水手等三十八人、該艦上次自閩來滬、入江南船塢例修、至本月二十一日、修竣出廠、由滬駛還閩海、</p>
<p>失事真相</p>
<p>海和巡艦在上海開出後、二十三日下午七時半、已過福州洋港口、將抵厦門之際、其地點在東經一百十九度又四十二分、北緯二十五度又四十二分、時因傍晚、海面黑暗不明、以致錯行航道、又因海面有霧、致該艦誤觸在礁石之上、艦底爲暗礁觸破、海水冲進、幸當時艦體半擱礁石、未致立時下沉、但情勢頗爲危險、</p>
<p>派艦往救</p>
<p>出事之後、船主即發電求救、當時太古之岳州輪、招商海亨等、均得到海和之SOS號呼號、而廈門之海關巡艦春星號、亦得到此呼救之電、遂即趕往施救、故岳州海亨均未前往、及春星艦到達失事地點、海和艦已經半沒海中、當由春星艦派舢板下海、將海和艦中三十八名船員等全行救上本艦、艦上所裝三磅加農砲一尊·機槍三枝·及官兵所用之匣子砲手槍子彈等、亦全數設法、駁上春星艦</p>
<p>艦體沒海</p>
<p>海和艦在船員官佐等脫險後、水已浸至上臺甲、幸下有礁石托住、故艙面猶得顯露、而春星艦奉命停在海和附近保衛、蓋防有匪盜等乘無艦保、上船拆卸物件也、聞海關方而、對此艦觸礁、損壞尙不重大、且係新造未久、决計進行打撈、總計損失須六七萬元、</p>
<p>厦門二十五日電云、海關巡艦海和號、二十四日自省出海、夜在厦附近烏鴉嶼觸　沉沒、二十五晨、厦嚴派員並徵艦往援船員回、輪新造、損失約五十萬、</p>

<p>粵漢路株韶段工程局長凌鴻勛、及湘鄂管理局局長殷德洋等、一行九人、於前日搭昌興公司日本皇后號輪抵滬、定今明日赴京、向中央及鐵道部接洽粵漢路全綫通車事宜、報吿工程進行經過、申時社記者特訪凌氏於旅次、承吿詳情如次、</p>
<p>凌氏一行抵滬</p>
<p>粵漢路株韶段工程、於二十二年動工興築後、現已大部吿成、明年年底、卽可全綫通車、本月十八日該路各段局長、曾在粵開會、討論全綫通車辦法、參加該會議之株韶段工程局局長凌鴻勛、湘鄂段管理局長股德洋、鐵道部專員汪禧成、一行九人、因有要公、須向中央及鐵道部有所商承、同時報吿粵漢路全綫工程進行經過、已於前日由粵抵滬、定今明日入京晋謁當局、商承一切、</p>
<p>株韶工程現狀</p>
<p>據凌氏昨語記者云、粵漢路株韶段工程、於二十二年七月開工、現所有株州至樂昌間四百零六公里之路軌等各項工程、均已全部動工、沿綫參加工作之工伕、刻已達十萬人、截至最近、全段土石方工程、已完成百分之七十五、隧道工程、已成百分之七十、禦十墻已成百分之九十、涵洞橋樑工程、成百分之四十、綜計全部工程、已完成十分之六、該段工程以廣東方面較爲艱鉅、但現樂昌向北舖軌、已有三十餘公里、再兩三月後、工程車卽可到達坪石、</p>
<p>明年全綫通車</p>
<p>凌氏繼談、俟工程車達坪石、該段工程、卽可告一小段落、蓋由坪石至長沙間、現已有公路可通、屆時將先辦鐵路與公路聯運、粵漢全綫路程、三四日卽可到達、此次在粵召開之三段會議、對粵湘兩省公路聯絡辦法、已有詳細决定、預計株韶段工程、倘無意外阻碍、在明年底、可望通車、在此兩年內、積極準備全綫一切設備、及統一各項章則、俾路工完成、全路行政及設施均可統一、將來全綫通車、三段路局將合併、成立總管理處、以一事權、</p>
<p>工料費五千萬</p>
<p>末據凌氏談、此次鐵部完成粵漢全綫、共需經費迷五千餘萬元、係由中英庚欵項下借撥、計工欽部份爲三千五百萬元、料欵部份爲一百六十五萬鎊、有不足之處、仍由鐵部補撥、該路全綫通車後、北連平漢、成南北交通之一大幹綫、不獨湘鄂粵三省礦植物等出產、在運輸上更臻便利、對於溝通南北之文化、亦大有裨益也、</p>

<p>大公社云、上海西人房產業主公會、於昨日下午四時、、在博物院路二十號伍連德堂、開本屆常年大會、計到會員三十餘人、由斯巴克君主席、報吿徵收地價稅及減租問題、等重要事項、旋選舉本屆董事、茲誌詳情如下、</p>
<p>地價稅事　開會後、即由主席斯巴克報吿云、鄙人在請求承認賬目以前、對於委員會上年之工作、擬先作簡單之報、諸位當猶憶及鄙人在上年年會、會提及上海市政府對於公共租界以外之地產、均須徵收地價稅一事、並報吿諸位、謂已由委員會致函領事團、請提出交涉、且經接得領團覆函稱、已向當局交涉、結果如何、再行通知云云、自上屆年會以來、委員會對於此項問題、進行未懈、且不特巳將此事之全部情勢、呈明當局、並分別公吿各合法團體徵求意見、截至今日、吾人對於此項問題、殊未能認爲已有滿意之解決、　若干國當局之態度、以其僑民在法律上雖無給付此項地價稅之義務、但仍勸其給付、而同時吾人亦確信尙有其他若干國之僑民、迄今猶拒絕給付此項捐稅、吾人所切慮者、即此項地價稅、恐含有不平等待遇之性質、本會固未主張租界以外之地產須免去一切地價稅、此不得不先聲明者、但本會主張此項地價稅、在性質上、不應有不平等之待遇、並應組織一正當而有效之上訴委員會、其性質須獨立、而其見解、尤不得有所偏袒、俾有關係之業主、對於因徵收地捐二估定之地價、得向其呈訴、就上種種以觀、關於給付地價稅事項、應請諸位、自行裁量、但無論如何、此項給付、必須附以抗議之條件、聲明對於案主之權利、並無任何影響、</p>
<p>審查地產　安年會有人向本會提出審查地產畝分之事項、蓋道契之設定抵押者、其面積畝分、因工部局冲讓馬路、道契上並無批明、往往不能正確、此事至爲重要、而因設定抵押借欵而估計其價値時、尤爲重要、本委員會曾與工部局接洽、擬使註册之業主、對於其註冊之道契、均可知其正確之畝分、工部局對於此點、亦頗諒解、允於不論何時、凡有業主以書面聲請者、即據實吿以該局徵收地稅之畝分、</p>
<p>減租問題　諸位恐均希望鄙人對於現在之减租問題、有所表示、然關於此點、鄙人須有聲明者、即本會組織之初、即經規定、「本會宗旨、並非與房客對抗、房產如有不衛生或危險之情形、本會即不與業主同情、且本會亦不帮助會員增加房租」、本會之目的、在研究凡足以影響地產而有公共或半公共性質之事項、租金一問題、全爲房客與業主間之個人關係、對於此問題、本會殊不能制定任何規則、蓋一處之房　、有一處特別之情形、非可一槪而論也、</p>
<p>空屋捐事　關於徵收空屋巡捕捐事、鄙人殊不以爲然、鄙人應請諸位注意者、巡捕捐實爲房客應担之捐稅、業主對於工部局旣已根據估定地價、繳納地捐、而此項地捐、又不論產業上是否有人居住、均須照付、則似無再令　主負担空屋巡捕捐捐理、</p>
<p>地產市面　今日地產市面、可謂暫爲烏雲所覆、此種情况、　不能不歸咎於白銀價値之　漲、但其重要之原因、實與一九三二年中日爭鬥之事件有關、蓋自該事件發生以來、地產市面、即從未回復原狀、東區北區尤甚、一遇銀根縮緊、衰落之狀、遂益露骨、以前主業將產業在外、抵押負擔之利息極重、現在一時無力附回、或另覓墊欵途徑、而債權人每每又施以　迫、遂致發生强制出賣、上海一埠、目前房屋建築過多、而市面又不景氣、空閒之房　、隨而增加、但上海人口如是之衆、且不能不繼續增加、目前之不景氣、自是暫時之狀態、現在之空屋、不久自有人遷入也、以本會之經　論、地產跌價、事所恒有、今日之局面、當仍是暫時之現象、蓋本會殊不信上海一埠之人口及地位、從此即不繼續增進也、目前房屋之建築、巳不若從前之踴躍、在短期間內需要、當能與供給適合也、議畢散會、</p>
<p>改選董事　主席報吿畢、旋即改選本屆董事、當選老姓名如下、（譯音）貝勒克洛·倍開而·巧洛可明·意脫林登·戈登·開浦登。肯脫。開恩·勞克·羅納斯·馬漢·同納達·密斯肯·派蘭斯登·魯濱遜·色達斯密司·斯派基·斯也基·立派遜·惠爾遜·</p>

<p>冒充軍官　上月二十七日、海亨輪從上海第七次、開往汕港粵、時有一靑年軍官上船乘輪、身上穿着制服，胸應陸軍部兵工署第一科科長余健符號、登輪時、購買二等客票、以軍官名義、要求半價購票、上船後、與船員頗爲接近、據其自稱、奉中央命令赴粵、向陳濟棠領取巨欵、緣本人由軍政部選考出洋、學習兵工專科、留學費已由軍政外交實業三部、核准四萬元、由中央撥一萬五千元、其餘二萬五千元、則請粵陳補撥、陳濟棠已經允付、本人此往乃領取此巨欵也、言時、取出軍外實三部會銜發給四萬元學費訓令、並軍政部兵工署第一科長余健護照一紙、與中央發給在美學生學金證一紙、船員不知其僞、羣認爲眞、對余健頗表敬意、</p>

<p>在滬行騙　在船五六日、各船員歷史、均爲余某探悉、甚至鄭蘇各人家屬地點·及戚友狀况、亦被余某在無意中探知、詎意到廣東後、余某即絕跡至海亨、而已另乘他船返滬、乃假冒蘇某鄭某等名義、至其戚友胡紆謨等處騙取金錢、同時用各船員名片、在外招搖撞騙、海亨各船員初未得知、及後得到其親友查詢函件、始知余爲騙匪、乃急電來滬、知照各家屬、勿受其愚、各船員中且派一人乘太古輪先還上海查究此事、</p>

<p>負責保出　昨日下午二時、又奉邵推事開庭續審、吿訴人方面、到屍弟朱士英、偕私訴代理人顏鴻熙律師同時到庭、被告則延林大文·馮美學·黃紹裳·等三律師到庭、為之辯護、由公安局派警將周平遠伴送到庭、問官升座後、命提在押之邢國農至案、略訊數語、官命證人楊懋榮至案、訊據供、年五十六歲、湖南長沙人、在本市公安局爲職員、住陸家浜、與朱劍秋舅甥關係、問你在偵查中所說的話、雖然沒有具結、但是有筆錄的、今天到庭說話、</p>
<p>須先具結　然後可再發言、你將過去知道的事實、詳細的陳述一遍、楊答稱、二十五日、我的外甥朱士英來電話吿訴我說、因爲戶籍處人口錯怏、警所將我學徒拘所被押、請求設法等語、當時我答復外甥、以此類些些小事、不過稍處罰金而已、至翌日（即二十六日）士英又來電話、據稱警所中對於違警細微小事、竟派警六名、將兄劍秋捕去、眞眞糊塗辦事、我接着電話、就回答說旣然糊塗若此、我就不管了、到了二十七日的淸晨、士英甥親自又來我處、說哥哥劍秋、被警所中</p>
<p>用刑傷命　我聞之、即囑士英延請律師具狀法院、依法處理、問、你托過李芸生巷你外甥設法解决戶籍事否、答、有的、因爲招到外甥的電話之後、我不認識眞茹警所人員、所以請李芸生救濟外甥違警之事、並囑他照章處罰辦理云云、次據證人李芸生供、年三十七歲、江西南昌人、在市公安局督察處服務、問、關於本案你預先有報吿的、所以今天傳你到庭、你將所曉得的據實陳述、在未發言之先、須先具結、問、眞茹警所你有人認得否、答、不過　識林巡官、問、你</p>

<p>本年度參加台維斯杯網球賽代表　承基鄭兆佳、巳定今晨十時搭大來胡佛總統號離滬赴美、昨晚協進會仍在申園籃球房內舉行表演比賽、美國著名女選手狄米屈理維夫人亦出塲表演、結果如下、</p>
<p>（單打）邱飛海人</p>
<p>六比一　六比〇　許承基</p>
<p>（單打）林寳華人　六比三　七比五　狄夫人</p>
<p>（雙打）　許承基　鄭兆佳十三比十三　邱飛海　卡爾生</p>
<p>許承基不慣燈光　八時半、許承基邱飛海才登塲、塲地稍嫌狹、欠週轉餘地、加以許承基不慣室內之　眼燈光、竟一籌莫展、速球亦難捉摸、雖間有一二記佳作、但無補實際、遂無心戀戰、以六比一、六比〇放棄、僅第六局得一局耳、</p>
<p>狄夫人大受衆賞　次由狄夫人對林寳華表演、狄爲美國一九三〇年女子單打冠軍、打來確有驚人之作、左右抽球、削球斬球、無一不佳、網前之半空壓球、尤博得掌聲不少、落地球隨乎揮來、速而且準、妙不可言、足見深具工夫、普通男球員、恐皆須受窘、第一盤林以三比一佔先、追成四比三、林以六比三得勝、次盤林又以三比〇佔先、繼成三比三、四比四、五比五、形勢緊張之至、林絲毫不放鬆、纔以七比五得勝、</p>
<p>雙打平手無勝負　最後雙打登塲、台維斯杯代表許鄭對邱卡、邱卡先開球、雙方勢均力敵、發球者皆獲勝、毫不能分上下、至各十三時、仍為平乎、以時間已晏、宣吿停戰、鄭兆佳昨晚表演、有顯著之進步、許則平平、不慣塲地之故、兩人合作、尙未見佳處、相聚之日甚少之故、昨晚日台杯選乎山岸西村二人、亦到塲參觀、由沈嗣良致詞介紹</p>

<p>江大籃球錦標、自啓賽迄今、戰程已逾大半、昨日計有兩塲、爲曁南對復旦、及中央對持志、分別在江灣水電路兩處舉行、查曁南復旦、實力俱厚、兩隊自參戰以來、均未敗北、允稱爲本屆聯賽中之兩巨頭、故昨日之戰、不啻爲一塲錦標决賽也、結果曁南全賴五虎將之奮勇、遂以五一對四十擊敗復旦、本屆江大冠軍、勢必由江灣移往眞茹矣、（上屆冠軍爲復旦）蓋曁南旣挫復旦、其餘各戰、皆可迎刃而解、另一塲中央以二十四對二十一幸勝持志、</p>
<p>暨南痛擊復旦</p>
<p>健身房中水洩不通　曁南復旦之戰、於昨日下午三時有半、在江灣復旦健身房中交鋒、因此戰勝負有關錦標之得失、曁南復旦兩校同學、愛校情深、寗願犧牲功課、而作壁上之觀、大有課可不上、此戰不可不看之概、故三時左右、健身房中已濟得滿坑滿谷、水洩不通、門之出入處、亦被觀衆塞滿、交通斷絕、後至者、祇得竚立門外、靜聽當時之呼喊聲而已、</p>
<p>比賽開始暨南痛擊　兩軍接觸、貴仁錦上添花、記分板上、高懸八分、復旦紙憑傅祥瑞罰進一分、暨南徐亨功不後人、加上二分、成十二對一、復旦翁周傅連投帶罰、激增十四分、成十六對十五、以一分落後、未幾複旦翁仁安罰得一分、造成十六對十六。對峯對峙、入後暨南諸將一氣呵成十四分、造成三十對十六、再度領前、復旦周達雲京中二球、成三十對二十之比、上半時於焉告終、</p>
<p>復旦反攻終遭敗北　再戰聲起、復日諸將處茲惡劣環境中、士氣極爲鎭靜、頻思出奇制勝、無奈對方防禦周密、無法下手、暨南愈戰愈勇、尹徐二將有投必中、復旦亡命追趕、無如得不償失、此刻間即成三十九對二十七、約十五分鐘時、暨南徐亨四次犯規、被罰出塲、復旦雖亦乘機反攻、無奈曁南球運亨通、隨手投來、莫不命中、結果暨南遂以五十一對四十獲勝、</p>

<p>日本台維斯杯網球代表山岸與西村二人、昨日赴歐過滬、中國網球會特邀請在新加坡路該會表演、查山岸等二人、去年由歐歸國途經上海時、曾在上海網球會一度表演、國人對於二人之技術、早經賞識、山岸技能甚精、西村不過爾爾、與我國選手鄭兆佳許承基堪稱伯仲、觀者達四五百人、頗爲熱鬧、茲將比賽情形、略述如下、十二時一刻起、由山岸對去年上海錦標卡爾遜比賽單打、山岸大刀闊斧、兇狠非凡、平急而深入底角之抽擊、使卡爾遜疲於奔命、第一盤卡得一局、第二盤竟一局亦不能得、一任山岸之控制、兩盤結果、費時僅半小時耳、</p>
<p>第二塲爲林寳華朋納維區對山岸西村之雙打、表演甚美、日選手攔網及高壓、利害無比、使林朋無法應付、林朋打來、亦甚勉力、但絕對不能擊破對方之陣容，二盤結果、林朋亦僅得一局耳第三第四塲爲單打賽、先由林寳華對西村、形勢頗見平均、但林不能持之以恒、頻頻送球入網、西村則穩健老練、自殺極少、林以一比六負、末塲則爲山岸對西村之自我對賽、均未用全力攻打、西村之遇山岸、一如林寳華之遇西村、亦僅得一局而已、强中還有强中手、可見藝術之奧妙矣、各組成績如下、</p>

<p>中國文化建設協會爲造成全國好學風氣、及提高文化水準起見、特舉辦全國讀書競進會、分設各地報名處於文化建設協會之各省市分會、已於四月二十五日起、開始報名、第一期讀書時期爲四月一日起、至九月底止、凡成績優異者、並備有獎金三千元、以資鼓勵、茲錄其宣言及報名辦法如次、</p>
<p>宣言　「生當這個國難嚴重的時代、就民族國家言、我們要充實我們的國力、這是無待煩言的、然國家的形成、旣由人長、故欲充實國力、首須充實我們國人的能力、且當此國際競爭激烈之世、其藉以决定勝負者、固爲政治經濟及軍事的實力、而基本則全在國民的智力、因所謂政治經濟者、不外是國民智力之總合的表現、故必民智高者、始能保其存在、而不爲人所夷滅、過去的中國、雖一再亡於異族、而卒能保有獨立的地位、且使武力勝利的民族、反爲我同化者、其故即由我國的民智高於異族、可是現在時移勢異、我們的智力、無可諱言的、是不及歐美日本各國遠甚、因此之故、不僅我們的科學落後、我們政治經濟上的實力、亦都遠不如他們、所以在這時候國民智力的充實、實有必要、而欲充實國民的智力、則惟一的方法、惟有全國一致埋頭攻苦、從事讀書硏究、這是中國文化建設協會當周年紀念之際、發起讀書競進會的第一義、</p>
<p>且就個人言、如生活技能準備、社會人情的認識、都有賴於讀書、所謂讀書明理者是也、而當此經濟困難謀生維艱之時、讀書求知似尤有必要、然而事實恰巧相反、彌漫於社會的、却是不讀書的空氣、頹墮萎靡遊逸淫業、相率成風、不僅靑年學生以鬧風潮爲常事、即著作界方面亦以幽默小品相尙、以此之故、虛矯之氣中人、造成了一種浮薄叫囂的風氣、欲革此習、自然只有從實際方面着乎、使人皆知好學、這由享樂頹廢到刻苦砥礦的風尙的轉變、便是中國文化建設協會發起讀書競爭會的第二義、</p>
<p>第三、今日的學校制度、其最大的缺點、便是以金錢爲升學階梯、貧困子弟雖有俊才、輒苦無入學的機會、次之、則所有功課、往往爲不必要的延長、常有數月可以授畢、必須讀至期年者、此在才識優異之靑年、尤感不能發展的苦痛、讀書競進會之發起、其意即欲　矯此弊、一以使貧困子弟有升舉的補助、二以使好學靑年得有自修上進的機會、故一方面旣商諳出版書店、對於課本書籍、以最低之價格出售、而於另一方面、並提出獎金、以爲鼓勵、</p>
<p>總之、讀書競進會的目的、不外如簡章所言、藉以鼓勵讀書、養成好學風氣、提高文化水準、但這却是建設中國文化、復興中華民族的基本工作、所望各界先進、海內賢達、不吝匡助　甚、幸甚、</p>

<p>— （嚴明）</p>
<p>世人善談目的，其一切行爲的表現，都是爲了要達到某種目的。然而他們在要達到他們所意識着的「目的」的過程中，却永遠不覺得有一個最後的目的。所謂最後的目的者，便是「死」。</p>
<p>在這一「死」的目的下看，一切人們所要達到的「目的」，可以說只是要達到「死」的「目的」的手段而已！一個人想脫離苦境，走入生之大道，不知生之大道，乃死道中的一段。</p>
<p>除些微時間上的差別外，生孩子，便等於死成人（此地所以不寫「老人」者，乃因人往往多在少年或壯年時，便會死去。）人一生下來，便不必經過訓練，個個都是運動塲上的長跑健將，爭先恐後的在爭奪着「死」的錦標。</p>

<p>— 蕉心</p>
<p>曾文正公的日記裏說：「窒慾常念男兒淚，」他的意思是說男子的淚如窒慾同樣的困難。但是劉玄德之娶孫夫人，全仗眼淚得來；諸葛孔明在柴桑口弔祭周郎，也以淚如泉湧而保全其生命；至於春秋時楚國解吳之圍，也全賴申大夫在秦國依庭牆哭了七日七夜，流了許多淚水之功，那末又誰說男子們不會淌眼淚呢？</p>
<p>淚和涕是難兄難弟，影形不離的，在俗諺說是：「一把鼻涕，一把眼淚」；在文言說是：「涕淚交流」。</p>
<p>「臘炬成灰淚始乾」，其實臘炬何嘗在下淚？不過當時這作者滿腹抑鬱，供它取喩而已；於是以後的春閨怨婦，對這沒有靈感臘炬，也不免觸景生情，憑空增　了許多愁思。</p>
<p>紅樓夢上說：林黛玉的善哭，是還給賈寳玉的淚債。那末天下的女子都善哭，也是還的淚債嗎？債字本來是個惡俗的字眼，加了一個淚字，便十分香艷了</p>
<p>淚是帶有鹽味的，據生理學家說：淚裏的水分佔百份之九十九，食鹽和蛋白質各佔百份之〇·五弱。它的功用能够使眼珠濕潤，並且能够洗滌眼眶裏的塵埃，並非專做表示喜怒哀樂用的。</p>

<p>— 吳雅非</p>
<p>到了無錫，當天就去拜訪了幾位朋友，晚上却獨自個兒回到了旅館裏，關了房門翻了兩頁國學槪論；然而覺得心裏煩躁得很，委實沒有心緒再往下看了。於是我便闖出了旅館的門，向着每一條街頭踱去。茫茫然的，漫無目的地走着，兩條目光却儘向四處溜，意識着這兒的夜景。</p>
<p>我像幽靈一般的闖上了這寂寞的街頭；時間已經是十一點敲過了，所以大部份的商店都已關了門，週遭靜悄悄的，冷僻得幾乎鬼也捉得出；這個小城市已浸入那靜穆的安息裏，等待着天明來到</p>
<p>「…月兒灣灣照街前……思想起故鄉好悽慘……多少人兒無衣食……多少人兒沒家歸……」</p>
<p>在一條漆黑洞洞的巷子裏，却有一種咿唔咿唔呀的胡琴聲，在漸漸地向巷口來，並且還夾着那悽楚調子的歌聲，是一個女子的喉嚨。但這音調顫抖得很利害，彷彿像是鬼哭，使我的毛髮也一根一根聳然地豎了起來！伊唱的一句句，一聲聲，都似尖刀般的刺進了我的心窩，我實在不忍聽它，也沒有勇氣聽下去了！我猛可的將身子向暗處一站，想避開他們，但借着一盞黯澹的街燈看去，見他們却正在朝着我走來，那淡黃色的燈光射在他們臉上，一個四十多歲男人在拉胡琴，一個三十多歲的女子却把嘴巴一撅一撅的哼着。臉色都一樣靑的像菜葉子，眼睛裏放着憂鬱的光，那男人的眼簾下垂着，沒有一絲神，女的也像是個失眠者。</p>
<p>這時我彷彿一個遇到猛獸逃回來的探險家，也似一個打了敗仗歸來的戰士，慌忙向旅館裏逃去：走進了房裏，倒在床上，我已不敢回想剛才的一幕，自己感到已是從一個想像不到的，世界裏的凱旋歸來者。</p>

<p>浣花又笑道，你請過來罷，我還有兩句話同你說，並不是要你帮錢。賈多才聽他如此說着，心想若是不到他屋子裏去，也許他會跑過來的。因之口裏答着隨着又走過這邊屋子來了。這時，楊浣花已不是先前那副樣子，臉上撲着粉，頭髮也梳得順溜溜的，見人進來，含笑相迎，牽牽衣襟，似乎又有幾分不好意思。賈多才在以往看到楊浣花，就會引起一層惡感。現時在燈下看到他那楚楚可憐的樣子，也就不怎麼厭惡了。倒先安慰着他道：剛才的事，算那是個夢，不必去放在心上了。你還有什麼話說呢？浣花坐在床上，遠遠的向他疑視着，儌笑道：賈先生能不能夠多坐一會了呢？我有長一點的話，同你說兩句，可是我决不要你帮我什麼欵子。他又這樣聲明一句，接着作個可的微笑。賈多才迄倒不忍再拒絕了，便點頭笑道：你說罷、反正晚上是沒事的，我就聽聽你的。浣花又牽牽衣襟，微微咳嗽了兩聲、才道：我先說兩個女人的故事你聽聽罷。第一個，是安徽。賈多才笑道：你在西安的小西天，怎麼想起安徽人的故事來了？浣花道：因爲也和我一樣，是流落在西安的。他是個十八歲的小姑娘，雪白的皮膚，鵝蛋臉子，漆黑的頭髮。他是常常的到小西天來，賈先生或者看見過。賈多才道：是個深綠綢短裙子的嗎？浣花道：對了，是他。你不要看他那樣，天天往旅館裏跑，他是一位知書識字的小姐。賈多才　了一聲道：他爲什麼愛向小西天跑，我看他好像作生意呀！（一六六）</p>

<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>我聽了伊這段很有含蓄的話，不由也暗暗嗟嘆起來，但是我對於把那些內中還有未死的蠶蛹藏着的繭子，投到沸水中去泡煮的一部份手續，終不能不認爲很殘忍；便又向太后提出了一個疑問。</p>
<p>「爲什麼不先把繭子的一端剪開一些，取出了那蠶蛹來再投到沸水中去呢？」</p>
<p>「這是不行的」！太后似乎很以我這一問爲愚　得可笑，但伊並不厭煩，還是極有與地答道：「繭子是萬萬不能剪破的，一剪破便不能再繅絲了。如其可以剪破的話，我們何不待裏面的蛹變成了蛾，鑽出來了之後，再拿去　絲呢？因爲繭子上的絲都很整齊的，而且是接連的，一破便不行了；而要從一個繭子上揀出一根絲頭來，又非得用沸水浸過不行。所以這個方法是無從改變的。……</p>
<p>「何况那些蠶蛹卽使不燙死，先把它們取出來了，過幾天也無非是一死而已！」伊爽快一針見血的攻破了我的無意識的憐憫之心。</p>
<p>太后對於蠶實在是當做一種調劑疲勞的娛樂品。伊雖在頤和園內劃出了那麼一大部的屋子專供育蠶之用，又化了許多的錢置備用品，採購桑葉，而且還養着那麼許多的女孩子，整年一事不幹的專用來照管育蠶；這一批本錢可眞不小。但伊却從不曾把伊所得的繭子賣出去，總是自己用來　絲的；而所繅的絲也是絕對不賣出去的，又不見有什麼大用處，只是一絞一絞的藏起來，或者凑伊自己一時的高興，再教另外一起製絲的女孩子們用各種鮮艷的顏色，把那一絞絞的絲染起來，然後再收藏，這樣無非是格外多化幾個錢而已。（二七七）</p>
<h3 id="c202">慈昌里飯舖速寫 <a href="#c202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>— 張慕良</p>
<p>在這午飯的時候，各寫字間都不約而同的散了。慈昌里兩邊的飯舖端正了那些熱飯，熱菜，等候着一般寫手間階級的吃客光臨；於是寫字間階級的吃飯生活便開始了。</p>
<p>吃客蠕蠕地在湧啦，擠啦，慈昌里立刻人烟稠密起來；後至者早已給捷足先登的朋友侵佔了！</p>
<p>這裏都是些老顧客，他們多數是吃客飯的，每客的價錢，一律小洋兩角。哼你們不要以爲吃二角客飯的顧客是吝嗇鬼，其實也吃得獅子大開口了；你想，出了二角小洋可以隨便揀一雜菜，（價値貴的當然例外）像炒肉片啦，炒鱔絲啦，小白蹄啦，……都可以隨便揀的；倘使飯量好的人，在不够吃的時候，還可以揩一些汕，我想，在小飯店裏恐怕沒有這樣的便宜吧？</p>
<p>有很多的吃客喚着吃「小白蹄！小白蹄，……』浦東老板娘提心弔膽的說：「喔唷！這樣許多的人都要吃小白蹄，眞要蝕本了』！</p>
<p>一個吃客對堂倌說：「今天替我燒隻炒魚豆腐加辣火，燒來道地點曉得嗎』？接着又有一個說：『喂！快點燒隻鹹肉豆腐湯，豆腐要燒得透，鹹肉要揀得瘦，油水足點……」</p>
<p>在這嘈雜聲中，張三要吃魚，李四要吃肉，有幾個飯舖裏「的堂倌給那些吃客弄得走頭無路，所以有幾個吃客吃了飯竟然不付錢，揚長而去的也有，由於這個緣故，一般堂倌都在啞子吃黃連，說不出的苦衷！</p>
<p>午飯的時候過了，一般吃客，都是蠕蠕地打從慈昌里出來，而走到每個人的寫字間裏去。</p>

<p>王吉人和仲人兄弟，為了析產問題，竟至入訟法庭〇兩方律師據理駁斥的啓事，和審詢的新聞，同樣地在報紙上一刊再刊，成爲最近一件熱鬧的新聞。</p>
<p>我和吉人仲人兄弟認識，還在二十年前；那時吉人的父親，還是錢莊的夥友，沒有升任經四以及轉入銀行界任職，所以王家的家庭狀况，也沒有近年來的富麗堂皇。</p>
<p>在我和吉人們認識的時候，是一同在那個李先生的私塾裏。那時吉人祗有八歲；玲瓏的身材，淸秀的面龐，我們幾個同學，對他都很親愛。仲人的年紀，更加小了，大約祗有六歲；一個生得圓圓的頭顱，面龐是那麼紅潤有光，活像一個蘋果。那種獃頭獃腦的形狀，我在無意中，常常會被他引出笑來。</p>
<p>私塾中先生的權威，確乎像專制時代帝皇一般的崇高。當先生的眼珠，圓圓睜着，戒尺在桌上擊出大聲的時候，無論一等一的頑童，也會嚇得像待决困犯，觳悚萬狀！我們在李先生的私塾裏面，當然也不能例外。</p>
<p>記得有一天，李先生大約因受了師母的氣，面孔板板的怪覺可怕；偏偏仲人這天的熟書，却沒有念熟，在背誦的當兒，背了上句，忘記下句，竟格格的背不出來。李先生將書一再拋了下來，叫仲人讀了再背，可是第二次第三次上去，依然嚇昏了，期期艾艾的背不出來，李先生發怒了，取起戒尺，砰的在桌上拍了一聲。可是這一聲，仲人的書，沒有嚇得背出，却呃的一聲，嚇得哭將出來。</p>
<p>這一哭，李先生的怒氣，益發冒將上來，他將呆呆地站在旁邊的仲人，一把拉將過來，用戒尺在仲人的手，撲撲的亂擊，然而仲人却因先生的擊打，越發哭得響亮；而先生的戒尺，也越發擊得緊密，到後來戒尺眞像雨點一般，在仲人身上頭上密密的亂打，可憐的仲人，頓時像鞭撻下哀鳴的羔羊，宛轉待斃。</p>
<p>然而，現在這一對友愛的兄弟，竟因家產問時，纏訟不已，想到這幕前事，我的心坎中頓題浮上一層惘。</p>

<h3 id="c218">「無為的倦怠」 <a href="#c218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>— 孟加</p>
<p>「無爲的倦怠」並不是「我們」的病症。</p>
<p>像高爾基在「鷹之歌」中所猛烈地嘲諷了的，滿足於潮潮的暖暖的暗穴的「蛇」似的人物，他們之「無爲」，也正因爲壓根兒他們就無須做什麼。多喝肥膩油湯，午睡，一睡倒却就打鼾；興緻好的時候，便手挽夫人之類散散步，逛逛公園，參加宴會，到了玩厭而興緻索然的時候，也會伸伸懶腰，呌聲「悶煞」！奧布羅摩夫之所以「熱望走到遠遠的地方去」，也不外是這種心理的表現罷了。而且一如他自己所確認，這世界是用不着改革的，這豈不是在說這世界太圓滿了？如果人們因此便相信他眞個要「跑到遠遠的地方去」，而且還是「爲了人類」，那就不但奧布羅摩夫全給人們笑爲傻瓜、連我們自己也變成傻瓜了。你想，以這麼一個爲怕麻煩就不想結婚，甚至連搬一下家都懶得的寳貝，他眞能「跑到遠遠的地方去」麼？</p>
<p>奧布羅摩夫之所以像一隻柔馴的鴿子，把頭夾在翅下，準備在同一屋頂下消磨一生，那是爲的這隻鴿子的食糧太充足了、所以竟想「養老林下」，躱在暖暖的巢裏幹幹閒適的玩意；假如牠早就餓若肚皮，或是今日顧不了明日糧的，就是牠唸熟了袁中郎，也怕很難有如此大的「風雅」吧。</p>
<p>話說轉來，要是「羅先生」活在現在，大槪他是不會那麼「生鐵悶帖兒」的，傻裏傻氣的了。在他那時候，足以引起變態的興奮的玩意還少，回力球塲，上面倒懸着出走後的娜拉之類的赤裸裸的舞女以供座客欣賞的大菜間，一元五張舞票茶點奉送的舞塲，門票五元的「觸目驚心」的足球賽，這些東西怕還沒有，老是蜷伏在別墅裏，吃飯，睏覺，吃飯，睏覺，總是這麼一套，於是乎「羅先生」「倦怠」了，「悒鬱」了。——生不得其時，惜哉！</p>
<p>現代的奧布羅摩夫之流，比從前聰明得多了。卽使這是死前的歡笑，他們也還是要享受的，而玩意也隨之層出不窮。「無爲之爲」，使他們忘却了寂寞，而且煞有介事地也自以爲是「有爲」的人了</p>
<p>「無爲的倦怠」是黛玉姐或寳哥兒的「閒病」。而這樣的病症又好像有點是過去的似的。「有爲的倦怠」却像天一天多而且更厲害起來。</p>
<p>至於不願爲「蛇」而又不能爲「鷹」的人們，那簡直不是「倦怠」，而是莫明其妙的「悒鬱」了，雖然這之間也有僅少的人竭力裝着間適的面孔——沒別的，「矯情」而已。</p>
<h3 id="c219">飯後 <a href="#c219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>— 林彬</p>
<p>踏出臭氣刺鼻的小飯館，摸摸衣袋；兩角十幾個銅子。明天飯錢還用不着愁！</p>
<p>朝家（就算是家吧！）走，在雨後石子路的爛泥漿上走，身子里鬆得多了……</p>
<p>突然心眼一橫，瞥見二房東的雅片臉，於是破鑼般的聲普：「房錢！過期一禮拜了！」肉腿像拖着鏈條，重重的。</p>
<p>—怎麼回言呢？……哦，先兜個圈子吧！怎麼回言？……</p>
<p>轉角：一陣奇香，頭碰在挽住另一個人兒的臂膀的人兒的肩頭，彈回來，一瞧：大學生模樣！</p>
<p>「不生眼睛！」生眼睛的人兒的眼睛像尖刀。另一個人兒：一咄：」</p>
<p>回敬他一瞥，意思是：神氣什麼！我也是大學生出身的，也有這愛人，說不定比你還高明點呢，雖然此刻你筆挺的西裝比我骯髒的布袍子漂亮。再轉個灣：一間烟紙店。</p>
<p>一個小工從短衣袋裏掏出三個銅子扔在櫃臺上：「兩支公司牌。」</p>
<p>肚子裏癢癢的，像有蟲在爬。</p>
<p>脚步放得特別慢，手在袍袋裏摸了三分鐘，終於摸出三個銅子，像那小工一樣，扔在櫃臺上：「兩支公司牌。。」不過臉朝外，火熱的。</p>
<p>把一支啣在嘴角裏，用另一間烟紙店櫃臺上的盤香點着，神氣很高傲，吿訴櫃臺裏釘着我的眼睛的眼睛：「這不是公司牌，是大美麗，」然而臉上的熱還沒全退。</p>
<p>腦袋像蜂窠，無數蜂在騷動：房錢，怎麼回言呢……！</p>
<p>走，無目的地走……</p>
<p>心一跳，因爲：</p>
<p>人行道下邊，爛泥漿上，翻滾着一個人，不，一頭世間少有的怪獸：兩腿只剩上半橛，末端包着粗麻袋布，麻袋布包着爛泥漿。身上，像有破布片，有幾處又像是肉，　不淸那里是布片，那里是肉，只有爛泥漿。頭面，像剛從煤炭堆裏攢出來的：不見眉毛，不見　毛，只有一對黃黃的眼睛，像垂死的人一樣，還放射着生命最後的光輝。嘴角差不多拉到耳跟，一嘴黃牙糊。叫喊，生的呌喊：「老爺！太太！做做好事……」</p>
<p>一輛閃亮的汽車箭一樣地射過去，潑起一陣泥漿，濺在塗滿泥漿的頭上，身上，手上，腿上，濺在沒有泥漿的黃黃的眼珠子上，用塗着泥漿的乎揩着眼珠子上的泥漿。</p>
<p>想：這種人幹麼不滾到黃浦江裏去？幹麼留在世間受這樣活罪？……</p>
<p>一轉念：想錯了。眼前現出一根黑絲，一頭吊住他的靈魂，另一頭吊住我的靈魂。</p>
<p>——我呢？是的，腿是全的。沒有躺在爛泥漿裏打滾。沒有當街喊着老爺太太。然而果眞不同嗎？不，同的，生活的本質是同的。不同的在於方式，在於程度。</p>
<p>我咬着牙齒想起了一切……</p>
<p>「喂，呆在這里幹麼？」</p>
<p>肩頭被拍了一記，轉過頭：大雜誌的大編輯。</p>
<p>「晤。」</p>
<p>「近來生活怎麼樣？」</p>
<p>「晤。」</p>
<p>看他要走了，一隻無形而有力的手拼命從我喉嚨擠出話語來：</p>
<p>「前兩星期送給你的那篇稿子怎麼樣，×先生？請快點看……帮帮忙……對不住……生活沒辦法呀！」</p>
<p>編輯點頭，微笑，走開了，嘴巴沒有作聲，作聲的倒是另一個嘴巴，「怪獸」的嘴巴：</p>
<p>「老爺太太做做好事！」</p>

<p>— 大保</p>
<p>祝福牲口快高長大，</p>
<p>祝福麥田來個好的收成……</p>
<p>懷着希望，</p>
<p>在新春，村民高興采列地點起燈籠，</p>
<p>燈光照耀着古巷，</p>
<p>點綴得像是個桃色的鄉村。</p>
<p>像希望之容易消散，</p>
<p>繁華的日子溜走了；</p>
<p>數一數新年的開消，</p>
<p>懷着憂愁——却又假裝着一副吉利的顧相，</p>
<p>往巷口，召集村民做「殘燈」的遊行。</p>
<p>提着紙燈，只讓鑼鼓暄天地敲，</p>
<p>可沒有誰人，能够買起一串鞭砲，</p>
<p>華麗的衣裳全拿進了當鏽，</p>

<h3 id="c221">七斤 <a href="#c221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>— 陳福熙</p>
<p>「媽，同學又在說我是傭人的兒子…」</p>
<p>「讓他們去說好了。」</p>
<p>母親的臉上堆着濃厚的陰影。</p>
<p>七斤是包媽的兒子。包媽，誰都知道是張公館裏的傭婦。七斤跟他媽住在公館裏，日間便在附近的小學裏讀書。</p>
<p>學校裏有很多同學，但誰都比七斤漂亮。七斤是鄉下囝，黑的臉，破舊的，大布的衣服，不會說話，不活潑，從進校到現在，成天是呆頭呆腦的。城裏的孩子會踢皮球，穗子，爬滑梯，跳繩子，宕鞦韆，但七斤初上學，這些玩意兒全不會。他是很孤獨的，全班的同學都不睬他，都不願和他同玩。在鄉下，七斤就有許多伴侶，和他們騎牛背，擲石子，或是赤了脚，跑到田裏去摸田螺，捕靑娃，會玩非凡；可是一到城裏，這些，在七斤，却連夢想也想不到了，那態度變得那麼滯鈍，走路時，慢慢地，幾乎把地上的螞蟻都要踏死。他膽小，懦弱，人家故意罵他，打他，他不敢反抗，情願自己吃虧。然而城裏孩子很俏皮，有時候，年紀比他大一些的，見了七斤，常常有意擦他的肩膀，或是打他的頭，七斤不但不回打，連一個字也不會哼。</p>
<p>「看這個鄕下人呀！……」</p>
<p>他們跟在後面喊。喊得起勁，還用石子丟他。在學校裏，他眞是被排擠的一個，沒有一個人，像他這樣受到欺凌與侮辱。又好像地位低，認識他的同學也不願親近他，彷彿和七斤親善，是失掉他們體面似的。孩子有孩子的心思，那種輕蔑，驕傲，虛僞的思想，在天眞的孩子也常會存在，這當然由於現社會所給予的毒。他們瞧不起七斤，就是驕傲，就是輕蔑人，一天，有一個同學失竊了一隻白銅的墨匣，遍尋不着，同班的便誣說七斤偷的。</p>
<p>「你偷墨匣！」</p>
<p>「墨匣一定是鄉下人偷的！</p>
<p>「我不偷，我不……」七斤說。</p>
<p>被許多同學包圍着的七斤發窘了。教室裏的人都說他偷，你一句，我一句，七斤到這時，不曉得怎麼分辯。翌日，不知誰，從七斤的書袋裏發現了失竊的墨盒。他們從他書袋裏掏出墨盒時，全班的人都向他嘲笑：說他做賊；說他的媽是個傭婦；說他穿的衣服，不知從那兒討來的；說他……這樣刻毒的，沒有同情的冷　，他聽了，幾次想哭，却又蜴力壓抑。他想：雞道自己眞的做了賊嗎？怎麼墨盒子竟從自己的書袋裏發現呢？但他又想到自已的確沒有偷，早晨從公館裏出來，書袋裏那裏有着墨盒！那末現在從書袋裏發現的墨盒究竟從那兒來的？難道從天上飛來的麼？他年紀小，生性老實，對於這無端的誣害，委實叫他莫明。在教室裏，在嘲笑中，七斤坐在凳上，紅着臉蛋，不說話，頭兒只覺得一陣陣發昏。</p>
<p>「大家看這小賊呀」！</p>
<p>等到放晚學，走在路上，同學們還是高聲的叫。但七斤始終不說話，默認了似的。他低下頭，眼睛望着地，一步步走，不敢向路旁斜視。走回張公館時，他的心格外地起了顫抖　。</p>
<p>「媽，同學又在說我是……」</p>
<p>「讓他們去說好了，七斤」。</p>
<p>然而七斤，這時站在媽的面前，却忍不住的哭了。兩行晶亮的熱淚，掛到他黑黑的瘦臉上。</p>
<h3 id="c222">吉野觀梅 <a href="#c222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>— 趙琦</p>
<p>（下）</p>
<p>穿過了綠漆地小欄柵，望着用梅花結成的，「樂樂園」三字的門額那邊走，本來在我打算這裏也像無錫梅園那樣小販雜買攤和洋車夫一切地暄擾的，不料現在這固有的印象完全破壞，戚到她是一個純粹的詩境。將要進門，在門的旁邊用老梅樁圍成一個花圈，上面撑一柄新式圖案的傘，這裏面僅立着一位很美麗的女郎，不論男女老人和小孩，都親自給你身衣襟上挿上一枝紙剪做的梅花，奉上一份綵繩紮好的小包裹，裏面有路綫指示的圖表，渡舟的引割券，還有小孩愛吃的糖菓和幾粒淸心丹。在她短短的袖口上繞着一面紅布寫着「案內」的字樣，原來這是吉野招待遊客的人家派遣做嚮導的。</p>
<p>進了園門才覺到這並非花園，是一座山的斜坡，我們繞着灣環拾級下去，高下地人家，門前總有一個花架。陳列着各種的盆椿，上面標着幾元幾十錢。這下面奔流着瀠洄的溪澗，泠泠底數着琴聲，我們在案內圖上檢到一條紅線，名呌奧多摩河的那便是這個了。渡過河，從一條綿密的松徑走上去，指路牌上的手指着從左邊去便是吉野梅區，站一刻遠遠地瞭望，四面環着薄翠的屛風，中間積一堆透明的綿質體，又像是一隻淺碧的琉璃碗裝着刨泳，因爲這裏一色是白梅，沒有別的種類的。</p>
<p>前面走不上幾步就入了深曲的梅巷。都市的少娘，這時都褪下了外套，在宮粉傅滿的頸子，和花鳥繡滿的背袱上，襯着潔白的花，很戚到色的調和而特具一種東方的美。</p>
<p>梅區一周約十餘里，本來就是一個大的梅村，每個人家的茅屋都埋藏在梅花裏。最繁茂的地方要算梅鶯軒和梅溪園兩處了，我們先經過的是梅鶯軒，在這裏亂走了一遍，在一家廊簷的蒲團上坐下，呌一隻天麩羅（日本料理名），下女的言語比都市裏的恭敬幾倍，可是最後算來，連一隻魚的價値也要比都市裏的加上幾倍。日本人都自己帶了飯盒子來，因爲他們知道的。</p>
<p>太陽悄悄地傾斜了，我們又起程往梅溪園去，我覺得梅樹的支勢以這裏爲最美，皺裂的，偃仰的每一個枝條都適宜於畫面上的佈置。果然沿着溪流看見許多倚着榭的石碑，上面鐫着年歲和×××畫家，詩人評品過的題蹟，再走過去，恰巧又遇到同車的那幾位年老的文人正盤坐在一叢花下，兩個淡妝的少娘，給他們酌酒磨墨哩。</p>
<p>我們在這裏拍完幾張照片，太陽已把梅花的背影從水面上移到對岸了。聽人說：由這裏到靑梅驛僅一里半，我們就决議往靑梅驛上車了。</p>
<p>臨行的時候，很使我懷疑的就是這裏有各樣指示遊客的木標，爲什麼缺少一個「禁止折花」的字呢？這許是管理人在顧慮中遺漏了吧！</p>
<p>走到靑梅驛很疲困地坐下來，同樣地這裏有一位女郎立在那樣的花圈裏，猩紅地晚照逗着笑臉，拉着細長的影子向我們每人進一盃茶，並且溫和地道一聲安慰的敬語。</p>
<p>四點五十分車子到了，車廂裏人大半是從梅林歸來的，看到他們連小孩的衣上除了一枝挿着的紙剪做的梅花，已外什麼也沒有，我心裏猛受了一個深刻的刺激，當人們被車子顚播到垂頭的時候，才敢把我從梅林摘下的挿在帽簷上的花朶靜靜地向窗外脫去。</p>

<p>— 德永直作葉蔭譯</p>
<p>一隻手的阿熊哥，不但只有一隻手，而且還是個跛子。到了夜裏，他就經常地在我家裏的沒有鋪地板的泥地上面，攤開空草包，跟那名叫「八」的我家的狗一塊兒睡覺。沒有鋪蓋，也沒有別的什麼東西，把半截紅氈子拿了來，合式地墊在頭上，就抱着「八」睏：這已經成了他的習慣。</p>
<p>白天，他就到別人家裏去，替人家做點零細事情，或是帮病人買東西，弄點買「剩飯」的錢。賺的錢稍爲多了點，他就馬上喝起酒來。那時候，平常總是沈默寡言的他，就變成了嘩啦嘩啦的角色。</p>
<p>他的臉部突出着巨大的顴骨；笑的時候，就在額上和嘴巴上現出許許多多的，非常大的皺紋。</p>
<p>一看見阿熊哥左乎帶着藥瓶去買東西的形影，小孩子就時常走前來大聲的喊着：</p>
<p>『跛脚的阿熊哥，現在幾點鐘……』</p>
<p>這時候，阿熊哥的臉孔就現出那些皺紋，答：</p>
<p>『十五點鐘。』</p>
<p>同時，還做着怪相，跳舞給人家看。</p>

<h3 id="c224">劉飛飛不是電影迷 <a href="#c224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>— 夢若</p>
<p>電影女明星阮玲玉的死，社會上和她抱同情的人，非常之多。日前報載，有湖南少女劉飛飛，這次看到阮玲玉自殺，憤慨異常，認定阮玲玉的死，張達民和唐季珊兩個人是罪犯，一個是貪財無恥，一個是另有新歡，故特地從湖南跑至南京來，托她的表哥李某，介紹她入電影界工作，以便代阮玲玉復仇。</p>
<p>對於這位湖南少女劉飛飛的舉動，社會上一定有許多人要說她是着了電影迷。阮玲玉的死，於她有什麽相干呢？而她竟毅然决然的要犧牲自已，去替阮玲玉雪恨。這種舉動，實未免過於奇突，不是電影迷是什麽？可是劉飛飛的舉動，奇突誠然有點奇突，頗像眞是入了電影迷似的。然而仔細一想，劉飛飛的行爲，或者尚含有別種意義也未可知。</p>
<p>劉飛飛之和阮玲玉表同情，傾倒於阮玲玉的藝術，自然是一個重要的因素。但在這個因素之外，我們疑心她還抱有一種爲被壓追女子伸寃的志向。蓋她深信阮玲玉的自戕，是給張達民和唐季珊兩個人壓迫而出此。故爲被壓迫女子伸寃計，她便决意要權牲一己，去代阮玲玉報仇了。若果我們的推測是不錯的，那麽劉飛飛的行爲，我們不能僅以電影迷目之，却是很有意義而且值得贊許的。</p>
<p>然而在這裏我們要吿訴劉飛飛，壓迫阮玲玉的，是張達民和唐季珊兩個人。可是在今日的中國社會上，被壓迫的女子，不只阮玲玉一個人，壓迫女子的男子，也不只張達民和唐季珊兩個人。故我們以爲劉飛飛如眞的抱有爲被壓迫女子伸寃的願望，不是向張達民和唐季珊兩個人復仇便算事了。我們應該把膽子放大一點，向全社會壓迫女子的男子去反抗。這樣，女子才可以得到眞正的解放。</p>

<p>— 眞</p>
<p>浩瀚的江水，現起伏的浪紋，泛在中流的一葉輕舟，裊裊地像一隻水鷗在戲弄波濤。</p>
<p>『要到了，客人起來收拾行李』！水手這末呌。</p>
<p>驚坐起來，我茫然地，埋一下頭腦，推開船窗門一望，高矗在天空的「仁丹」廣吿牌，睜着笑眼在俯瞰逝去的江水和鮮艷的落日。</p>
<p>走出艙門，把蜷伏在胸中一整天的悶氣向空一瀉，覺得身子也减輕了好幾斤。</p>
<p>籠罩在暮靄中的觀音洲，似乎要被滾滾的流水吞沒去，而隔岸對峙的城陵磯，則閃着一幅傲岸的臉子，戍守這一道出入必經的關門。</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>這裏是長江和湘河匯合之處，要達岳陽，必須溯流而上：因此，當我們的船轉入逆流，就有兩個水手拿着撐篙，兩個水手上岸拉縴了。晚秋的洞庭湖畔，荻花蕭瑟，泥濘沒膝，拉縴的水手，就在這跬步難移的途程中奮鬥而前進。</p>
<p>舟泊岳陽城的下灣，湖已深鎖在一片暮烟中了，突起湖心的君山，只在我們渺茫的想念中。</p>
<p>船上起過一陣噪音，大家回　錢，各自挾着大包小裹，奔上岸去。</p>
<p>岸上，經過湖波冲激得渾圓淸脆的石子兒，有使我們一步一躓的魔力，從草棚裏透出的數點漁燈的殘光，更迷亂了我們渴望的去向。</p>
<p>終於找着岳陽樓門了，門陰森地像無底洞，雖是晴天，石級上滿綴泥漿，沒有亮，只有排列在城門的盡頭處點盞螢火那麼大的火油燈飄忽着。</p>
<p>「朋友，當心跌交」。走上前面的某君這樣警吿我。</p>
<p>轉上凹凸不平的街道，疏落的街燈，彫零的人影，擺出一幅不景氣的醜相，不過七八點鐘光景，有的店門便關緊了，賸下幾家茶市酒店，尚有些吵雜聲點綴這古城之夜。</p>
<p>我和某君住在柴家嶺一家小客棧裏，破窗板壁，小得可憐，蛛網到處高張着，墻上旅人塗抹的遺跡，全都模糊了，一股霉氣，在整屋子裏猖獗着。</p>
<p>「這屋子很久沒人來住了吧」？</p>
<p>我們坐下，喝過一杯茶，便這樣問。</p>
<p>「近來市面不好，任憑那一家都沒生意」！茶役說完，接着嘆息了一聲。</p>
<p>「你們怎樣不打掃？這樣子更沒人來了」！</p>
<p>「怎麽沒打掃？『屋要人成』，很久落不到個把客，老板把我們好幾個當差的也辭掉了，現在只留下我一個人，又要燒飯，怎麽來得及」！說得很累的樣子。</p>
<p>「如果客來多了誰招呼客呢」？</p>
<p>「多的時候，老板和老板娘都來帮忙」。</p>
<p>最後換了一間房，價錢增加到一千四百，不過此較原先的淸潔一點。吃通晚飯，爲着第二天要趕火車，某君提議夜遊岳陽樓。</p>
<p>由於茶役的引導，踏上石級，拐了一個灣，到了呂祖的正殿，佛像神座，煥然一新，匾額對聯，則很少古蹟，由此我們知道都燬消於兵燹的刦火中了。但「信士」們的焚香禱祝，仍紛去沓來，和尚敲鐘擊鼓，異常忙碌，彷彿岳陽的景氣市塲，移在這裏！可見在這腐老的中國社會裏，愚夫愚婦們是何等迷信神來挽救他們於水深火熱的極底中！轉到第三層樓空坪上，在一支欲泣的電燈下，湖水黑壓壓地與天共浮，四壁石泐的　詞，斑剝得浮出白花了，連刻在木板上的范仲淹的序文，也好像有滄桑之感。</p>
<p>回到旅店裏已十點鐘了。第二天東方尚未發白，我們便離開了這盜竊處名的古城。</p>

<p>— 野菲</p>
<p>大才子到這爿理髮店裏來作學徒，已經快二年了，然而他身上的鞭子痕也正隨着這年，月，日，時而增加：到現在他自已也不知道身上究竟有多少鞭痕？而且別人也沒有替他去數過，卽使眞有這麽樣一個人會去替他數，也不見得就數得淸楚的。因爲他每天遇到偷懶或做錯了事（在他師傅看來）的時候，就要去挨師傳的打的，但是他每天被打了之後，並不見他有一次哭泣過，這倒不是他不會哭，實在是他師傅不許他哭。他要是哭了！就有再挨一次更重鞭子的危險！他是明白的，做學徒的只有忍耐，便是給師傅寃枉了，也祇好把氣望肚子裏嚥，沒有吐出來的權利的；所以只許師傅打自已，而却不准自已哭一聲。然而大才子倒並不是不敢哭；他知道用這多餘的眼淚在師傳面前去流，他師傅未必會就此心軟、反而簡直等於去討生活吃。</p>
<p>他記得，自從那年母親給他穿上了一件生平第一次上身的新藍布大褂，家堂前點了一對五燈燭，他向家堂叩了三個頭，接着和四鄕八鄰去作了個揖，便跟着一位堂舅父離開了家門。彷彿這時，那位年紀不甚高而臉上却顯得很老的母親，還送了他一程，在航船離開埠頭的當兒，母親曾含了眼淚這樣叮囑他：「大才子，你跟舅舅去，家裏沒有飯給你吃，到上海去吃飽飯吧！不過，一切自已要小心，師傅的話更要聽；娘的話你記住，上海是好地方，你看鄕下多苦！我希望你學滿了生意回來，替你死去的父親爭些光榮，我這半世的苦也就不枉吃了……」她話沒有說完便哭了。</p>
<p>這時的大才子好像沒有感覺，他不笑，也不哭，更不說話，兩只眼睛只痴爿着他母親劃滿了淚痕的瘦臉發楞；他不懂得母親的心，她旣希望他去學生意，爲什麼現在倒哭起來了呢？關於母親叮嚀他的話，他全然沒有在自已心裏分析過。他只知道上海是好地方，他能够有機會到這好地方去，該是幸福的。雖然也曾想到一旦間便會和相依爲命的母親分別，並且一別就要這麽悠遠的三年；當時確實有些悲哀，然而他這僅有的悲哀，終究是給這憧憬着的美夢所掩沒了。</p>
<p>他就在這年進了這爿理髮店，同時還點起了比自已家裏家堂前所點的那對五燈大上數十倍的紅燭，並且又向一個大塊頭恭恭敬敬的叩了三個頭，堂舅父就敎他呌了一聲師傅以後，他就把整個命運都寄託在那師傅身上了。於是每天掃地，洗毛巾，揩傢生，燒水，校手巾的，開始他的學徒生活，忽忽兩年，只有悲哀和痛苦在他身上不斷地增加，而所謂憧憬的美夢是完全破滅了！他覺得母親的話是錯誤的，什麽吃飽飯，好地方，和替死去的父親爭些光榮！</p>

<p>傍晚，村上的人家底屋頂，飄若一縷縷嫋嫋的炊烟，很詩意地直飄到天空裏，跟着橫過藍天一朵朶的淡雲緩緩地消散了。這時村上的空氣特別的靜謐，就是睡躺在門口的小狗兒，也懶散得沒有勁兒抬起頭來。祇有滿身染着斑斑的泥漬從田隴裏做完了工作歸來的村人，在他們的歸途中，時時轉過頭來帶看奇異的眼光掃射這沉着腦袋踉蹌蹌地走着，像喪家的狗的四維嬸。</p>
<p>抵了娘家，陡然間一陣凄楚在四維嬸的心坎裏襲轚起來，眼前像給一片陰沉的愁雲遮罩着。她想起娘家的顚沛零落，和父親的早亡，成串的酸淚，不由得從眼眶裏滔滔地淌下來。然而，她有什麽辦法呢？不上娘家又有什麽地方可以歸宿呢？於是，她伸出那發顫的手，輕輕地推開那扇發霉舊陋不堪的竹扉。</p>
<p>「婆婆，姑太太回來了……姑太太，怎麼這樣晚才回來？一個人？……」嫂嫂正在庭院裏飼鷄，匆忙地放下小鷄的糧食，迎上前來。「怎麼？姑太太，眼睛不好嗎，怎麼腫痛的像兩顆爛胡桃？」</p>
<p>四維嬸全沒有回腔，使勁地跨過庭院裏，把褪色的紅布衫包丟在汚穢的泥地上，倒到她媽的懷裏去，小孩子受委屈似的呱呱的哭出聲音來。</p>
<p>嫂嫂也發了怔，連關竹門的工夫也沒有，緊跟在姑太太的後面，跨過了院子，驚散了正在院子裏啄食的小鷄。</p>
<p>「巧兒，幹嗎這麽哭呢！……在路上受了委屈，還是在夫婿家？……」</p>
<p>一塲痛哭過了之後，四維嬸似乎覺得有點疲倦，哭聲比前稍輕細些，喉頭像透不過氣似的儘在抽咽着。她斜仰起腦袋，瞧着媽龍鍾的老態：稀疎的鬢髮，花白的像披着幾根銀絲，那隻撫摸着她的頭髮的手，也乾瘦的像柴枝似的，於是，她的心又重新地感到悲哀凄楚，眼淚像山泉似的在眼眶裏湧出來了。</p>
<p>「巧兒，到底爲了什麼事情，說給媽知道？……」老人的聲音也有點兒顫，心裏越焦急了。</p>
<p>「媽，我……那殺千刀的已……不要我了，去討……小妖娘，說我白吃他家的飯，不會……給……他養個把兒……子！……」四維嬸斷斷續續地說着，同時，喉頭的氣也抽咽的更加急促了。</p>
<p>「豈有此理！四維家可不是發了昏了！其實姑太太不過三十幾歲的人，誰敢判定她以後就不會生男育女！」嫂嫂到這時才明白，氣憤憤地呌駡着。「自已的公祖不積德，無福生兒抱孩，這可要抱怨誰呢！……姑太太，不要哭，明天招集幾個人到四維家去和他理論，難道他有幾個臭錢就可以隨便地糟蹋人嗎？再不然，村上也還有村規哩。……」</p>
<p>媽的腦袋像臨風的楊柳般的搖曳着，半句話也說不出來，分明她的老邁的心靈也像四維嬸般的殘碎了。</p>
<p>四維嬸就這樣的住在娘家，一月，二月，三月，……起初嫂嫂還很同情她，照顧她。然而日子一長久，娘雖則還是一樣的愛惜她，可是嫂嫂對她的態度，却像朝霧般的淡薄了。有時還借着很多小事故，用駡牲畜的口吻來影射她，譏誚她，简直　她不是一個家內人！當鄰居的入們在暗地裏議論她，和嫂嫂對她奚落的時候，她的胸膛就好像給毒箭穿過一樣的疼痛，她覺得她眞是世上最苦命的人！她惟有背着人流着行行的熱淚，來發洩她滿腔的苦悶。</p>

<h3 id="c233">關於阮玲玉演技獎金之創立 <a href="#c233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>幾天前，本刋曾經有「創立阮玲玉演技獎金芻議」一文。當時我讀過之後，頗有一種興奮而又憂悒的感覺。爲了促進中國電影演員們演藝的努力和生活修養的健康，爲了滅絕悲觀的風氣，同時也爲紀念一代藝人阮玲玉之死，這種獎金的創立，確有其偉大的意義。因此當時我確是相當興奮的。但是自已也對於這一提議考慮一番：中國電影界很難於有一種組織，這是大家都知道非常淸楚的。譬如從前有過電影協會，因爲受着一點客觀的阻力，大家便不熱心，不久便烟消火滅。以後又有一次電影茶話會，那不過是隨便談談的東西罷了，然而假使大家都熱心愛護的話，也不是沒有好處的，未嘗不可以談談大家有益的事。可是又不知道怎麽一來，不久便無形消滅了。到如今是什麽都沒有了。電影從業員，彼此都獨立在黑暗中摸索。相互之間，不相聞間。甚至於連一個電影圖書館或電影研究會之類的組織，都沒有可能實現。證諸這些事實，對於這演技獎金之創立，我不免爲之憂悒，雖然這是由於過於興奮而來的。</p>
<p>果然，從那篇文章提出之後，並沒有看到很大的反應。特是電影從業員諸君子，更沒有提出具體由意見，雖然那文章的作者是在期待着人們之熱烈討論的。固然、中國人從來就很相信「祇掃自已門前雪」的人生哲學，但是對於這爲他人也是爲自已的事情，總不宜過於緘默吧？不過我總相信，一件社會事業的成功，一定得有幾個傻勁的人在盡力幹去的。至少我個人總得提供一些意見，作爲一種參考。</p>
<p>關於這獎金的實現，最主要的是經濟的來源。當然，假使年獎一人，假使獎金爲二百元的話，那末就非有基金二千元不可。（二千元長期存欵，如以年息一分，計算，可得二百元）這不是一個很小的數目，决不會有誰肯獨自獨出的。而且個人捐助也不如社會的集資來得有意義，因此我以爲籌欵的辦法，應當以眞正從社會觀衆中間得來爲原則。因爲袛有熱情的觀衆，才是中國電影有力的支持者，而且也袛有廣大的觀衆，才是電影演員們最眞摯的受護者，同時也是他們生活行爲有力的監視者。那末在這原則之下，我以爲有三種可以走得通的辦法。</p>
<p>第一，募捐。成立一個募捐委員會、分別在各電戲院，各學校及其他敎育團體捐集。</p>
<p>第二，以阮玲玉的主演的最優秀的作品，徵求聯華公司的同意，捐助的放映，將票資所得、作爲基金之一部份。</p>
<p>第三，演戲。自阮玲玉死後，一般遊戲塲、都將其當作閣瑞生或黃慧如同樣的生產之道，大家都將她的死編排爲「香消玉殞記」之類的戲劇。不消說，在那些應時曲本中，我們如要求眞實的分析阮玲玉的人生觀及其死因，乃是很少可能的事，相反的不過是遊陰曹地府之類的胡閙而已。那末假使我們能爲了紀念阮玲玉好好的來演一次戲，决不是沒有意義的，同時更將此收入作爲基金的籌聚。</p>
<p>如上所述，都是在可能範圍中可以做到的，所剩下的袛是實行的麻煩。也許除此以外，還有更好的辦法、這有待於關懷中國電影的人們熱烈的商榷了。</p>
<p>編者註：自三月十九日本刋披露旭東君「創立阮玲玉演技獎金芻議」一文後，本刋即接到來函數件，均表示贊同幷自願盡力捐助，惟望本刊領導籌劃進行，俾有意義之計劃，不至終歸泡影云云，至爲感慰。惟惜供未有具體之意見提出，且響應者究屬寥寥，可見社會人士，對於尚未有深切之認識迴想阮女士安葬之日，滬上士女，空巷往觀，途爲之基，因此而知閑人看熱閙者儘多。披而出空身體，替社會人羣做些有益之事者尚少，至爲可歡也。今幸凌君以此文見示，亟爲技露或者有聞風興起者，尤望電影從業員爲切身利害起見，能提出相當具體辦法，或貢獻有用之意見（文字不必作發表之打算，但作提供參考足矣）。不敏</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3 id="c234">評「滑頭關亡婆」 <a href="#c234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>— 繼漢</p>
<p>Their　Big　Moment</p>
<p>——大上海映</p>
<p>假使我們承認這一影片是因爲有了莎蘇薛茨和蘇滿范爾的兩副尷尬面孔而製作的話，那末人們第一注意的便是她們二人的演技了。一般的說，莎蘇薛茨並非不可以演戲的，她的個性的發揮，確能成爲一般老實婦人的典型的代表。所以她有時在某種作品中做一個配角，常使人們哄堂大笑，同時也使人們深切的體味着那種人本性的蕃良與可愛。但是唯利是圖的電影商人，常常爲了勉强迎合觀衆的所好而不惜戕傷演員的。如莎蘇薛茨不能不接二連三的攝製一些毫無道理的滑稽短片，便是一個例子。於是她在這些庸俗的製片商的操持之下、失去了觀衆的同情，她也不過是好萊塢的一個俗物而已。至於蘇滿范爾，曾經演過「陸花律師」之類的滑稽片，從來就沒有過較好的成績。也許有人說他並不大呌火跳的胡閙、但是也不能深入一點的的刻盡現實的人生、他所能做到的，無非是一副似乎是老實人而似乎又是傻瓜的面孔，用比較靜的姿態來逕人發笑。然而如今是人們將滑稽當作幽默的時候，所以也有人對於他頗覺滿意的、因爲如此，他的作品也爲一部份觀衆所歡迎的了。</p>
<p>現在我們再來看這「鬼話連篇」的「滑頭關亡婆」這裏又是一個非現實而幾乎是神話的故事，並不能引起我們多大的的興趣。內容也只是空虛，庸俗而且無聊。在　　　　　　　　　屆　會有什麽好戲可看，何况導演也祇是平淡無奇的叙述故事。雖然有時也可使人笑笑，可是整個的戲，刦是不能引起人們情感之共嗚的。莎蘇薛茨和蘇滿范爾、又只是舊調重調的反覆着原有的演技，沒有一點新的花樣。本來就不是富有天才的演員，何况這裏又在沒有多少創作能力的導演之下呢？結果如何，也就可想而知了。雖然這是因演員而製作的作品，但是他們的演技，也不能使人們痛快的大笑一塲。</p>

<p>— 羅平</p>
<p>自Carl　Laemmle初次將明星的名字置於銀幕上之後，明星制度便很快地建之了；一直流行到現在。</p>
<p>可是，誰也不容否認，明星制度有其本身的弊害。舉個倒來說，因爲太重視了「明星制度」的緣故，某女星之死，至少給予了倚賴於這個制度上的電影商人以一種不小的損失。</p>
<p>最近，沈西岑和史東亡二導演以姓名的筆劃或出塲的先後解决了排名的問題，這雖不是根本的解决，然而，這種新的，進步的方法是值得推薦給每一個電影導演的。</p>
<p>美製片家沙繆爾高爾溫爲愛弟康德之新片，特懸賞二萬鎊徵求一簡單之本事。</p>
<p>現在流行着一種對於悲劇電影的非議，說是悲哀的題材將使許多的小市民增加了頹廢消沉之情緒，甚至以爲和色情電影同樣「毒害」了觀衆，然而誰能否認：作爲反映現實「生活」的電影藝術，在這一種悲慘的現實世界中，不能够有「歡樂」的題材產生？</p>

<p>「逃亡」的導演，是那年紀很輕，個子很矮，唇上留有着卓別林式短髭的岳楓先生，他的處女作就是那描寫漁民生活痛苦的「中國海的怒潮」，這片雖因受了種種的阻難，失去了原來的眞面目：那些動人的美麗的畫面與技巧雖亦被前去了不少，但它仍然比普通一般低級平凡的影片爲佳却是事實。</p>
<p>「逃亡」是他第二部的作品，題材是非常的現實，在他聰明活潑手腕的導演下，是有了更大的成功，畫面的偉大雄壯，故事演進的緊張刺激，鏡頭角度的準確美麗……一切的一切，都是值得我們嘉讚的，故一般的說，「逃亡」是中國電影有史以來的第一部最有力量最成功的暴露片！至少；這片的情調的別緻，就可以一醒觀衆的耳目。</p>

<p>— 懋德</p>
<p>並且如果密耶法或出於畏懼，或出於無誠意，不能如期的倒戈，那亦就全部計劃失敗了。克萊夫匹在愁思憂慮之間，他的夫人進來了。她的手裏拿着一束鮮花。她低聲的說道：「你走了之後，我正想到禮拜堂去。」克萊夫點着頸道：「忽忽已經兩年了。」不差的，兩年了。兩年之前的今日，他們將那小克萊夫葬在倫敦的一所敎會公墓裏。克萊夫想起來，不覺慘然道：「瑪格勒蒂，不知道你會不會恨我的。我使你蒙了這樣大的損失，受了這樣大的痛苦。我祗知取，但你是與。</p>
<p>瑪格勒蒂亦慘然道：「勞伯特，快不要如此。你亦是與。我們一切難關，都會安然渡過去的，是不是？」克萊夫拉着她的手吻着。她又問道：「這次戰爭要多少時候？」克萊夫道：「一個月……兩個月……不一定的。薩拉烏特都拉和他的軍隊駐紥在對面柏拉賽密爾耶法亦在那裏。他答應倒戈帮助我的。」瑪格勒蒂道：「你相信他的話嗎？」克萊夫道：「至少我相信他的話嗎？」克萊夫道：「至少我相信他的貪慾，一心想做皇帝。或者這次不戰而勝了！那末和平，家鄕，富足，安居，都是我們的了」</p>
<p>瑪格勒蒂偎倚在她的丈夫身上。克萊夫又悽然問道：「瑪格勒蒂，你吿訴我一句話。比方我到了站在歧途的時候。我向前進勝了固然無話可說，倘使敗了，那就是我們的滅亡。薩拉烏特都拉對於男子，女人，和兒童，是一些仁心沒有的……你吿訴我，你准我不准我，讓我自動的向前進呢」？瑪格勒蒂看了他的臉，躊躇了一回，然後說道：「勞伯特，你知道，我是很簡單的，但是我知道一個男子，像你這樣的是沒有人能阻止你的」。</p>
<p>克萊夫很感激地點着頭。她是水久諒解的。她從來沒有違背過他的意思。外面號聲又起，他一定要出去了。他將她緊緊摟在懷中，溫存了一回，然後低聲說道：「再會吧」。他們二人不得不分開，好像有一種勢力將他們分裂開來似的。克來夫於是忽忽地走了。</p>
<p>克萊夫和他的隊伍，靜待了十天，隱伏在森林之中，還沒有敢渡河。那些日子都是恐懼惶惑的日子。如果密爾耶法背信，那末他所得到的慘果，將遠勝於歷史上所記載的卡爾喀答的黑洞的慘案。那時薩拉烏特都拉將一百四十六個英國人，關於一個地洞之中，那個地洞袛有一個小孔通空氣。所以過了一天，裏面的人都窒息死了，祗剩了三四憫人苟延着殘喘。爲了這種慘無人道的行爲，克萊夫才决定了要和密爾耶法聯盟，除去這惡魔薩拉烏特都拉。如果他他不能除掉他，英國人在印度將永遠沒有安枕之日。但是這却是一個極冒險的行動。</p>
<p>這時總督特地從聖大衛堡壘跑了來察看形勢。他帶了一對瑪格勒蒂的信來。克萊夫接了那信，往口袋裏一處，亦沒有就去拆看。總督問着他前途如何。克萊夫偢然地答應，密爾耶法　　　　　　　。但是他時時刻刻，都可以　到前</p>

<h3 id="c239">近年來住宅建築的新趨勢 <a href="#c239" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e239" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">239</a></h3>
<p>— 希浩</p>
<p>建築學在這幾年來猛進的趨勢，實在是駕乎其他的應用科學，尤其是對於住宅建築，不僅在技術上，和形式上有顯著的進步，同時在最重要的根本觀念和設計上具著新的發展，這實在是二十世紀建築的特色，亦是建築史上未有的光明的一頁。</p>
<p>在十九世紀和以前的工程師對於「住宅」意義的認識，實在是非常的膚淺，他們以爲「住宅」不過是人們勞碌後晚間的歸宿所，所以乃時的「住宅」建築，不過用來掩蔽風雨的侵蝕，免除意外的襲擊罷了。所以外表雖然有着雄偉的石質的高叢，但是牠們有這二十世紀的「住宅」上，一般工程師巳認爲有更深切的意義，現代的「住宅」，不令是在安息勞碌的人類，併且是人類的永久安慰者，這實在是今昔住宅住宅建築的主要區別點。</p>
<p>和諧和玲瓏，是新式住宅的特點，和諧第一個的成功，就在住宅各部頒的適當比例，在過去的住宅建築上，對於各個屋子的體積，每每不加深切的研究，以臻應用起來就感到不便，例如會客室的過分寬大，廠房的過於狹小等等，這種比例失當的結果，一方面使材料過分消耗，他方面使整個建築失却價值，新式住宅的優點，就是各部體積比例的相稱，務使屋主容易前後照應，而得到安適的美感。</p>
<p>住宅內裏和外表的顔色設計，在十九世紀的工程師，從來尚有注意到，這實在是大大的錯誤，顔色對於人們的感覺，影響非常之大，適當顔色的配置，特別被陽光反射的室內，能夠使整個心靈得到快感和安慰。現在各國的建築界，巳有專門研究建築上顔色設計的工程師，這實在是前所未見的，因了輕金屬採用的猛進，美麗的建築用人造顔料在多量的配置成功，鋁箔，鋅漆等等，現在巳是很普遍的採用。</p>
<p>現在的工程師，對於住宅的設計，巳放棄一般舊式的陋住和笨重的厚牆，因爲新的建築材料的繼續發明，從前粗大的支柱巳被　現在輕巧的綱骨組合樑所替代，一般的新式的住宅上，你有時候要很奇怪的找不到一根柱子，原來這種柱子有時候很輕巧的藏在牆壁裏面，有時候却儘量的省略去而代以玲瓏的橫樑，這樣一來，地位的擴展頗大，同時對於整個住宅的美麗，要增加不少。</p>
<p>現在差不多每一種的建築材料，都經過材料試驗機的試驗，牠們的性質和能受的力量，都有詳細的記載，所以計劃住宅的時候，可以很精確的進行，不必用過分巨大的安全因數，這樣一來，建築的費用就要來得節省，而材料的浪費，也可以減到極小。</p>
<p>樓層的住宅，現在巳有激增的趨勢，但是層數雖然增加，而是每層的高度，却比較過去的樓房減低，這種低層的建築，工程師巳公認便於設計，並且來很堅固，高大的樓層，實在也不需要，因爲經過光綫和體積比例的研究，巳證明低層樓層樓屋的優點，同時對於人們精神上的安慰，也有相當的證明。</p>
<p>除掉以上種種外，新式住宅對於內部的設備，也日趨完善，水電管導接的便利，消毒設計的周密，現在比較大一點的住宅，都有娛樂所的設備，家庭電影塲或是小規模的運動塲，使人們得到需要的安適。</p>
<p>總之，現代的工程師對於「住宅」的意義，巳作更深一步的認識，現代的「住宅」，不僅解決「住」的問題，同時牠漸漸的變爲人們心靈上的永久安慰者了。</p>

<p>第六節　電爐法</p>
<p>電爐法爲最佳之鍊鋼法，即上述各法所鍊得之鋼，亦可入此法重鍊，以求潔淨。</p>
<p>鍊製之步驟：計分三步，曰氧化，曰還原，曰完成</p>
<p>（一）氧化—氧化時，用生鐵礦及石灰，共置爐中，經熱力放射高熱，鐵礦乃放氧而發生氧化作用，使雜質如矽鎂硫燐，皆成氧化物，而共結成一黑色渣滓</p>
<p>（二）還原—以石灰五份與長石粉一份之混合半液體，與白煤一分之四份相合，成一還原劑，投入爐內，閉竭空氣外入，使爐內氣溫漸漸下降，當鋼質被還原後，其渣滓當現黃褐色，而且同時有電石臭氣外放，足以示明。</p>
<p>（二）完成—欲使鋼質完成，必須加入有用這質料多種，如鎳，錳，鉻，碳，硈質等是也。</p>
<p>總計三步所經時間，每鍊鋼一噸，當在四五小時之間，而所用電力每需一百至二百基羅瓦特小時也。</p>
<p>是故此法雖能得較佳之鋼質，且不須其他燃料，然其所用電力，極多熱之浪費及電之過昂，故頗經濟，現上海中央研究院鍊鋼廠有此裝置，上海鍊鋼廠每有一小規模者在也。（第四章完）</p>
<p>第五章　鋼鐵論</p>
<p>第一節　鋼鐵含有雜質之利害，足以影響及其硬度，力能，靱度，等性，茲就其平常慣有之多種物質　述如後。</p>
<p>（一）碳質——碳質在鐵中，其成份在百分之一、二五時，可使鐵之力能增強，惟若不分配均勻，而成粒狀時，則僅足使鐵堅而不靱，故須注意。</p>
<p>碳質在鋼中之成份，普不一致，其在軟鋼中者約有百分之〇、〇五至一、五，在建築用鋼中者約有百分之〇、一五至〇、二五，在中等鋼中者約有百分之〇、三五至〇、八至一、二，在刀鋸等器具用鋼中者，　有百分之〇、六至一、五：蓋刀鋼須堅，故需碳也多，如保安剃刀用鋼者，有專名曰高等碳精鋼，非此即不能有快口之刀鋒可得。建築用鋼，但求勞堅，故需碳不多。</p>
<p>（二）矽硅——平常鋼料中之含有矽量，約有百分之二〇、〇，而特等鋼不過百分之一、〇至四、〇；建築用鋼所含令百分之一、九左右，至彈璜及汽車用鋼，則亦在百分之二、〇左右。</p>
<p>（三）燐質——鋼鐵之含燐多者，其質必脆，不經久用，故以含有百分之〇、五至一、〇爲度，逾此將不堪應用。（未完）</p>

He Yaozu reported on "The Turkish Renaissance and the Efforts We Should Make During This National Crisis," stating that China and Turkey are both Asian countries with the longest history and the most advanced culture. Turkey encountered great difficulties after the Great War and lost territory. Fortunately, General Kemal Atatürk called out to the nation, leading the people to resist with force and diplomatic means, which enabled Turkey to revive. This spirit of struggle is worthy of our learning. Although the Chinese and Turkish nations are different, to revive, we must uphold this spirit and make all the people of the country follow the instructions of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, restore national self-esteem and self-confidence, unite as one, struggle hard under the sole leadership, save the country from danger, and revive the nation. This should not be difficult. The meeting adjourned at 10:00 AM. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 25th)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The National Government's Memorial Week was held on the morning of the 25th. Deng Jiayan, Chen Shaokuan, Lin Xiang, Chen Xunyong, Chen Qicai, Lu Chao, Wei Huai, and other officials from various departments and commissions, totaling more than 500 people, attended. After President Lin led the ceremony, Shao Yuanchong reported on his impressions of inspecting Zhejiang and Anhui provinces, stating that his impressions of inspecting various places in Zhejiang and Anhui recently were excellent: (1) Although the two provinces suffered from drought last year, the winter relief was able to be carried out because the local people and the people of the whole country were able to work together on relief matters, and the spring relief is also being actively carried out; (2) Based on the actual situation obtained from inspecting various county governments, it is hoped that people with advanced abilities can take on the difficult and arduous task of serving as county magistrates to promote all construction in the region; (3) Even the people in remote rural areas deeply understand that in the face of national crisis, only by striving to become stronger and working hard can we resist aggressive powers. From this, it can be seen that national consciousness has become widespread. In addition, there has been significant progress in transportation development, the spirit of farmers' hard work in production, and education. From the above, it is sufficient to prove the greatness of the Chinese nation's construction and vitality. No matter how difficult the environment encountered, its spirit of striving and working hard will never be slackened. This also proves that the future of the Chinese nation's revival is not far away. Shao also hoped that those with considerable political responsibilities could go to the local areas to inspect and understand the actual situation and then offer their opinions for the central government's reference.

<p>(Tianjin) Regarding the Japanese and puppet authorities' crackdown on Chinese people leaving the Pass, according to a certain important person, both direct and indirect negotiations on this matter have been difficult. It is certain that the puppet authorities implemented this order to prevent too many Chinese people from leaving the Pass, which would reduce the profits of Japanese and Korean immigrants and increase foreign exchange. Ii and Takahashi have made it clear that they cannot help. This is certainly a shirking of responsibility, but it is also difficult for the Qing Reclamation Commission to achieve results in such negotiations. While the puppet authorities prohibit Chinese people from going to the Northeast, they allow Chinese traitors to recruit Chinese laborers to go. This shows a contradictory policy. In fact, the number of Chinese laborers recruited is limited. After arriving in the puppet territory, they are not allowed to engage in other activities besides their place of work. When they cannot work in the cold winter, they are driven back into the Pass, which is different from those who voluntarily go to reclaim land. Therefore, they are allowed to enter the country. (Special dispatch on the 25th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The rumors that the Japanese and puppet authorities were obstructing Chinese laborers from leaving the Pass, after negotiations, it was said that they were willing to postpone the implementation for one year.

Therefore, of the 130 passengers on the Beiping-Shenyang train leaving the Pass last night, about 110 were allowed to leave, while the remaining 20, who were intellectuals, were still prevented from returning.

<h3 id="e29">The Hundred Million Yuan Financial Public Bond and the Relief of Industry and Commerce <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>— Li</p>
<p>China's foreign trade has had a trade deficit every year, and cash silver has been constantly flowing out. This is the main reason for the decline of China's national economy. Last year, the United States' purchase of silver caused an even larger outflow of cash silver, causing anxiety in the financial sector, and is a proximate cause of today's economic panic. In today's panic situation, credit is tight, and loans are contracting. Industry and commerce are suffering greatly, and they have had to call on the government for relief. The way to provide relief is to treat both the symptoms and the root cause. In terms of treating the symptoms, the only option right now is to increase the capital of banks so that banks can fully provide loans to industry and commerce to stabilize the market. In terms of treating the root cause, the most important thing is to encourage exports and reduce the trade deficit. The Central Political Committee, in order to relieve the panic, specifically passed two proposals from Finance Minister Kung on the 20th of this month. One is to issue a financial public bond of one hundred million yuan to increase the capital of the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications, in order to invigorate finance and provide industry and commerce with funds. The other is to reduce or exempt export taxes and abolish customs transit taxes in order to reduce the cost of goods and facilitate the circulation of goods. These are truly relief measures that consider both symptoms and root causes.</p>
<p>Regarding the relief of the panic, the various banks in Shanghai have recently been able to work together to provide various loans to relieve the difficulties of industrialists and merchants. This is truly a welcome phenomenon. For example, recently, the member banks of the Shanghai Banking Association - the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, the Shanghai Commercial &amp; Savings Bank, the China &amp; South Sea Bank, the Continental Bank, the Jin Cheng Banking Corporation, the Yien Yieh Commercial Bank, the Kincheng Banking Corporation, the Silk Industry Bank, the National Goods Bank, the Commercial Bank of China, the China State Bank, the Sze Ming Bank, the Chekiang Industrial Bank, the Chekiang Commercial Bank, and the China Industrial Bank - have specially formed a syndicate, together with the Central Bank, to provide small loans for industrial and commercial credit. Their benefits to the maintenance of the market are certainly not insignificant. However, because the amount of loans is not large, it is feared that it may still be a drop in the bucket. Moreover, recently, loan requests from various provinces and cities have all been negotiated with banks in Shanghai. Although banks in Shanghai are willing to provide more loans, they cannot but feel inadequate in this difficult time. Now, the government authorities have decided to issue a financial public bond of one hundred million yuan, with 30 million yuan allocated to the capital of the Central Bank, 25 million yuan allocated to the capital of the Bank of China, and 10 million yuan allocated to the capital of the Bank of Communications. The remaining 35 million yuan will be allocated to the Central Bank as circulating funds. It is intended to increase the lending power of the banks. After the issuance of this public bond, the paid-up capital of the Central Bank will increase from 20 million yuan to 50 million yuan. The paid-up capital of the Bank of China will increase from 24,712,200 yuan to 49,712,200 yuan. The paid-up capital of the Bank of Communications will increase from 8,715,600 yuan to 18,715,600 yuan. The three banks will be able to respond more readily to necessary loans in this city and other places. This is why the industrial and commercial sectors have mostly expressed welcome to this public bond.</p>
<p>Although this financial public bond still awaits the resolution of the Legislative Yuan and the approval and acceptance of the shareholders' meeting of the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications, the matter is beneficial to the relief of the market. Moreover, President Wang has solemnly stated that "the purpose of issuing the financial public bond is to increase the capital of the Central Bank and the Bank of China and Communications, in order to invigorate finance and provide industry and commerce with funds. There is absolutely no intention of manipulating or controlling it." (See the Central News Agency Nanjing Dispatch on the 21st). It should be understood by the general public. In the future, if the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications can appropriately increase commercial shares, their capital will be even greater, and they will certainly be able to better meet the expectations of society in relieving industry and revitalizing the market.</p>
<p>However, the issuance of financial public bonds is still a palliative measure. Regarding the fundamental solution, such as the reduction or exemption of export taxes and the abolition of customs transit taxes passed by the Central Political Committee, we also hope that they will be implemented as soon as possible. Both palliative and fundamental measures must be considered comprehensively in order to gradually eliminate the root causes of the panic.</p>

<p>(Tianjin) In Southern Hebei's Da-ming, Ji-ze, Qu-zhou, and Ping-xiang counties, the people are opposing the Chang-lu salt police destroying salt ponds, depriving them of their livelihoods.

It is said that although Dr. Yinjidi practices Western medicine, he has conducted in-depth research on Chinese medicine. This time in Beijing, he originally planned to visit Zhang Yun-zhong's exhibition of physiological anatomy charts, but he arrived one day late and the exhibition had already closed. Zhang gave him a brochure. Yinjidi and others went to Shanghai that evening. (25th Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Berlin) Berlin is the focal point of the world today, as the long-awaited meeting between British and German statesmen, whose outcome is expected to have a far-reaching impact on European peace, is now underway. British Foreign Secretary Simon, Lord Privy Seal Eden, and British Ambassador to Berlin, Phipps, drove to the Chancellery at 10:30 this morning. After exchanging customary greetings, they immediately began discussing substantive matters. The German representatives are Chancellor Hitler, Foreign Minister Neurath, and disarmament envoy Ribbentrop. According to well-informed sources, Ribbentrop's participation indicates that disarmament and compulsory military service will be major topics of discussion. The talks were suspended during lunchtime and will resume in the afternoon. (Reuters, 25th)</p>
<p>The talks will continue tomorrow. Simon will fly back to London on Wednesday or Thursday, while Eden will travel to Moscow, then Warsaw and Prague. He is expected to return to London on April 4th.</p>
<p>The results of this trip will be reported to the Cabinet and Parliament by the two officials. On April 11th, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, French Foreign Minister Laval, and British Foreign Secretary Simon will meet in Stresa to discuss the overall situation based on the reports of the British Foreign Secretary and Eden. (Reuters, 25th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Regarding the international negotiations on European issues, which began last Saturday in Paris, British Foreign Secretary Simon and Lord Privy Seal Eden will first hold their first talks with German Foreign Minister Neurath here at 10:00 today. Then, German Chancellor Hitler will meet with the two British statesmen. Last night, the British Embassy held a reception for the two British cabinet members, and today, Foreign Minister Neurath will host a formal welcome. Tomorrow, the British Embassy will invite German Chancellor Hitler, all German cabinet members, and British guests to a public banquet, followed by a reception hosted by Hitler. (National Telegraph, 25th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) According to Simon, the British cabinet members met with Foreign Minister Neurath for only half an hour this afternoon, and the discussion was purely procedural. It is generally believed that Eden has already informed Neurath of the results of the Paris trilateral talks this afternoon. Neurath replied that the German people believe in the British cabinet members and believe they will understand Germany's needs. (Havas, 24th)</p>
<p>Discussion of Issues Can Be Divided into Two Parts</p>
<p>The British community here believes that the main purpose of the discussion is to exchange views rather than seek practical compromises. It is said that German diplomats intend to divide the issues discussed into two parts: one is issues that can be resolved with an exchange of conditions, such as the air pact and naval matters; the other is issues that are extremely difficult to compromise on, such as compulsory military service, the Eastern Locarno Pact, and the Austrian question. The colonial question and Germany's cession of Memel to Lithuania under the Treaty of Versailles are unlikely to be discussed, as the former would make the talks more complicated. Simon's purpose in seeking consultation is limited to European security and does not want to cover these matters. The British community considers Memel to be a matter for the League of Nations to handle.</p>
<p>The Eastern European Pact is the Most Difficult</p>
<p>Regarding the air pact, no difficulties are expected because Germany also urgently wants to establish it. The same is true for naval matters. Germany's ambition in this regard today is not as great as it used to be. According to unofficial opinions, Germany would be satisfied with a navy of 400,000 tons, including some submarines. The most difficult issue is the Eastern Locarno Pact. According to a Reuters interview with a senior official, mutual assistance clauses seem impossible to accept at present. It is also said that Germany does not seem willing to give up its interests in Austria, and Hitler himself pays particular attention to this. As for compulsory military service, the number of new troops has not yet been determined, and negotiations are possible. (Reuters, 25th)</p>
<p>German View: Hostility Towards the Soviet Union</p>
<p>(Berlin) Well-informed sources in the British community here believe that Hitler is currently making a large-scale effort to lure Britain into Germany's political trap. It is generally remembered that Lord Lothian, secretary to former Prime Minister Lloyd George, and Lord Allen of Hurtwood, a confidant of Prime Minister MacDonald, visited Berlin in January this year and met with key figures in the German government, bringing back reports detailing Germany's political conspiracies. These reports have not yet been published. The content states that Germany's main idea is to hate the Soviet Union, considering it a deep moral enemy. To compromise with Soviet Russia would be a "crime of destroying culture." These are Hitler's own words. Therefore, Hitler may even propose concluding a trilateral pact between Britain, the United States, and Germany to mutually guarantee against external aggression. To show that this pact is not directed against France, he also intends to explicitly recognize Germany's western border and the existing borders between Germany and Poland, Czechoslovakia, Belgium, and the Netherlands. In this way, Britain can avoid the Eastern European mutual assistance pact, and the Soviet Union will be effectively isolated. Regarding the Danube Pact, Germany intends to accept recognition of Austria's independence without reservations, asserting that "if the Austrian people wish to merge with Germany, they should have the opportunity to clearly express their will." The implication is that the activities of the German National Socialist Party should not be considered interference in Austria's internal affairs, just as the activities of the Austrian Heimwehr should not be considered interference in Italy's internal affairs.</p>
<p>Equal Demands for the Army, Navy, and Air Force</p>
<p>In addition to the above, Germany also demands three things: (1) Germany's military equipment should be equal to that of the most powerful land army in Europe; (2) Germany's air force strength should be equivalent to that of Britain, provided that the British air force is equal to the most powerful air force in Europe; (3) Germany should have a navy of 400,000 tons. Regarding the last point, according to Lord Lothian's observation, Hitler seems not unwilling to compromise, only demanding that the German navy dominate the Baltic Sea while allowing Britain to control all the oceans. This plan was learned from the British side. It is not yet possible to determine whether Hitler's proposed plan has changed substantially in these Anglo-German talks. However, it should be stated that the British Foreign Office spokesman believes that this plan is unacceptable. (Havas, 25th)</p>
<p>Optimism on the British Side Regarding the Future of the Talks</p>
<p>British officials in Berlin have a cautiously optimistic attitude towards the outcome of the Anglo-German talks, but they have clearly stated that the purpose of the discussions is not to make suggestions or concessions, but to gather information. The German side believes that Hitler's main purpose is to make the British representatives, Simon and Eden, understand Germany's current foreign policy, especially Germany's suspicion of Soviet Russia. Germany now has spiritual and political reasons to regard Soviet Russia as a major enemy that the Western powers cannot harmonize with. There is no doubt that Soviet Russia poses a danger to other Western powers. A strong Germany is the best European barrier to defend against this danger. This is an important part of today's German diplomatic negotiations and will likely be presented to the British representatives today.</p>
<p>Several optimistic observers have proposed that Britain, Germany, and the United States conclude a mutual guarantee treaty and recognize Germany's eastern and western borders to isolate Soviet Russia. However, some have clearly stated that this kind of imagination cannot currently gain support from political circles. German newspapers also seem to be optimistic. Today, the Deutsche Tageszeitung said, "The meeting has begun under auspicious signs." (Reuters, 25th)</p>

<p>(Berlin) Eden and Simon met in Amsterdam and then flew to Germany together, arriving at Tempelhof Airport at 5:34 last night. The British flag was hung in the middle of the two German flags at the airport. Several of Hitler's trusted Black Guards were stationed at the airport to welcome them, showing respect. German Foreign Minister Neurath, British Ambassador Phipps, and other dignitaries all stepped forward to pay their respects when the plane landed. The crowd also cheered enthusiastically. After Simon exited the plane, the Black Guard commander drew his saber and approached Simon, standing at attention and saying, "Hitler's Guard is here to welcome Your Excellency." Simon smiled and raised his hat in reply. Then, the group boarded the waiting cars and went to the British Embassy. The crowd along the way was like a wall, gathering on Wilhelmstrasse to watch the distinguished guests. The British Embassy was also packed. Thousands of people gathered in front of the Hotel Adlon, where the two distinguished guests were staying. The streets through which the cars passed were filled with cheers, and many people shouted "Long live!" The situation was the same when the two distinguished guests went from the British Embassy to the hotel. When they arrived at the hotel, other guests and the crowd outside cheered. (Reuters, 25th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) British Foreign Secretary Simon and Lord Privy Seal Eden arrived safely at Tempelhof Airport here on a large Imperial Airways aircraft today at 5:30 PM, precisely on schedule. The visit of these British dignitaries is of great importance to the future of the world. The importance of its nature has been conveyed to the entire German public through newspapers, radio, and newsreels in the past week. Therefore, tens of thousands of German people welcomed the British guests at the airport. Simon was the first to open the plane door and descend amidst the cheers of the crowd. He was followed by Eden. German Foreign Minister Neurath and other government officials had been waiting on the field for half an hour and immediately stepped forward to greet them. Neurath and Simon talked to each other at the airport with a very friendly and sincere attitude. Chancellor Hitler sent his personal guard to guard the field. When the British guests got off the plane and passed in front of the guards, the commanding officer stepped forward to salute and report the task of guarding the field. Many government officials were present to greet them today. They had arrived at the visitors' area since the afternoon, and the lawn was already full. Those who arrived later had almost no place to stand. British Ambassador to Germany Phipps also led the entire staff of the embassy to welcome them. Other German dignitaries included Meissner, Secretary of the Chancellor's Office and Hitler's personal representative, Buelow, Secretary of the Foreign Office, and Bassewitz, Director of the Treaty Department. Many German and foreign journalists were also present, especially British reporters. When the British guests left the airport, Foreign Minister Neurath and British Foreign Secretary Simon boarded the first car, and British Ambassador Phipps and Lord Privy Seal Eden boarded the second car, one after another, to the Hotel Adlon, where they would be staying. When they drove away, the cheers at the airport had not yet subsided. (National Telegraph, 24th)</p>

<p>(Berlin) British Foreign Secretary Simon and Lord Privy Seal Eden are here to try to stabilize the disturbing situation caused by Germany's rearmament. Their prospects have encountered obstacles. Italy and France do not want to be too lenient, and the Little Entente is becoming increasingly uneasy.

In this environment, the Romanian government believes that this is the best step to take. Italy and France are now demanding that their military strength should be superior to Germany. The two countries have entrusted Eden to convey to Simon their minimum security and military needs. It is said that the two countries intend to observe Simon's discussions in Berlin calmly, but they are not bound by the results in any way. (Reuters, 25th)</p>

It is claimed that after Germany announced the abolition of the military clauses of the treaty, the Polish Ambassador to Germany visited Foreign Minister Neurath to explain his government's views on the general international situation. However, this was only a formal visit. In addition, General Schindler, the military attaché of the German Embassy in Poland, rushed back to Berlin from Warsaw after receiving the news of the restoration of conscription. (Havas, 25th)</p>

<p>(London) With Foreign Secretary Simon about to meet with German Chancellor Hitler, newspapers are paying particular attention to the following two points: First, Germany needs to recognize the sanctity of treaties, as this is an indispensable condition for organizing a peace mechanism. Second, Foreign Secretary Simon's mission is limited. Although this trip is very important, it has not adopted a firm resolution. The Daily Telegraph states, "Foreign Secretary Simon and Lord Privy Seal Eden do not intend to haggle between Britain and Germany; nor are they plenipotentiary ambassadors of the united front of Britain, France, and Italy. Foreign Secretary Simon claims that his mission is only exploratory in nature, as if exploring the geological structure layer by layer in order to delve into the deepest layer of the international collective system. On the German side, even the most stubborn of the National Socialist leaders may not expect to release another shocking thunderbolt just one week after the previous bombing. We believe that if we consider the procedure set by Britain calmly, the consensus of opinion between Britain, France, and Italy is not difficult to restore, and the communiqué issued after the Paris talks the other day is enough to dispel the last remaining worries. As for the task of advising Germany to return to the League of Nations, it should be based on a strong spirit and realistic circumstances, and cannot be achieved by empty words. Germany should make sincere efforts to ease the situation, which cannot be forced. However, acts that undermine the Treaty of Versailles, such as what happened ten days ago, must not be repeated in the future." (Havas, 25th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Newspapers are still uneasy about the Berlin talks between British and German cabinet members, fearing that Germany will make formal concessions to Britain while trying to alienate Britain and France on matters that are difficult for France to accept. Le Petit Parisien writes, "We can easily guess that Germany will propose several suggestions that the United Kingdom would like to hear in order to lure the United Kingdom, such as enthusiastically participating in the Western European air pact, especially that the armaments of various countries should have a certain limit." Le Journal writes, "If the arms limitation treaty is based on the condition of equal rights for the signatory countries, Germany will certainly not refuse to participate. Germany may even propose the principle of general arms reduction as a cover for its deception. In other words, after Germany implements compulsory conscription, its military quota has exceeded that of neighboring countries, and neighboring countries should not conclude alliances to defend themselves. However, Germany's concessions must have certain conditions, and Germany cannot recognize other countries' conclusion of similar alliance pacts, France's political and military rapprochement with Soviet Russia." Le Jour says, "It is generally said that Germany intends to make some formal concessions to please Britain, such as rejoining the League of Nations. Has Britain felt too accommodating towards Germany's concrete gestures, and should it not exchange symbolic gestures again in the future?" (Havas, 25th)</p>

<h3 id="e64">French Chamber of Deputies Passes Naval Construction Bill <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>(Paris) The Chamber of Deputies discussed the naval construction bill and passed it by a vote of 453 to 125, authorizing the Ministry of the Navy to begin construction of one battleship before December 31 this year to replace an old ship. At the same time, it will also build two torpedo boats. In addition, it is authorized to spend 785,000,000 francs on battleship construction, 148,000,000 francs on torpedo boat construction, and 132,000,000 francs on the purchase of accessories and materials between 1935 and 1939. (Havas, 25th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The Chamber of Deputies discussed the naval construction bill this morning. Stein, the reporter for the Chamber's Naval Committee, stated the reasons why France's battleships should be replaced, saying that France's three Voltaire-class battleships, with a ship age of 24 years, three Jean Bart-class battleships, with a ship age of 22 years, and three Lorraine-class battleships, with a ship age of 19 years, for a total of 185,785 tons, are all obsolete or equal to scrapped ships. However, the new ships built in 1935, including torpedo boats, are only 34,400 tons, costing about 928 million francs. In addition, if new ships are not built, the number of shipyard workers who lose their jobs will reach 2,000. At this point, Socialist deputies proposed postponing the discussion of the bill. After Navy Minister Pietri clarified, the Chamber rejected the Socialists' proposal by a vote of 413 to 160. Stein continued to say that France had proposed a maximum limit of 25,000 tons per battleship, but the United States, Japan, and Italy were all building 35,000-ton battleships, and the cost of France building a battleship fleet was perhaps four times less than the cost of building an auxiliary fleet. The construction bill will continue to be discussed this afternoon. In addition, the passive air defense bill will also be discussed this afternoon. (Havas, 25th)</p>

<p>(Washington) If the US mysterious plane test flight is successful today, the US Air Force will have even more advantages. The Associated Press has learned that the test flights are currently being conducted by naval experts, simultaneously on the east and west coasts. One large aircraft is currently being tested in Alameda, California, and another is being tested by experts in Norfolk, Virginia. Officials are keeping the contents of this aircraft strictly secret. The Associated Press has learned that the new aircraft has a wingspan of 100 feet and is equipped with attack and military equipment. Its combat power is similar to that of a battleship. The engine has 830 horsepower and is equipped with six machine guns. Its rear can be loaded with two tons of powerful bombs. The entire aircraft requires eight people to operate. Naval experts say the new aircraft can fly 3,000 miles non-stop. If the test flight is successful this time, the Navy will build 30 more of these new aircraft and divide them into three teams, sending them to Pearl Harbor in Honolulu and the west and east coasts.

<h3 id="e66">Widely Rumored in London: China to Borrow Funds from Britain - £10,000,000 <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>(London) It is rumored here today that China is planning to borrow a debt of £10,000,000 from Britain. All parties believe that these negotiations will take a long time due to many political and financial implications. As for the suggestion that China should borrow a large sum of silver from the United States, following the example of the cotton and wheat loan method, people here do not quite agree with it. This is because it is difficult to predict the silver price at the time of repayment in the future, and the gold price is also uncertain, making it impossible to predetermine the silver price at the time of repayment.

<p>(Harbin) A munitions depot in the suburbs of Harbin exploded at 11:00 am yesterday. The explosions did not stop, and black smoke filled the air, as if it were being bombarded. Residents feared that the end of the world had arrived and hid in cellars for eight hours. Houses were shaken and heavily damaged, with some collapsing. The amount of loss is yet to be estimated. "Manchukuo" and Japanese troops risked their lives to rescue and extinguish the flames. The exact number of deaths and injuries is currently unknown, but the number of deaths is not expected to be as high as several dozen. The authorities are currently investigating the cause of the fire. However, a Reuters reporter heard that various explosives had been stored in the depot for many years, and internal heat had caused the disaster. Fortunately, a large batch of highly explosive materials had recently been moved elsewhere. The authorities plan to build a new modern munitions depot to prevent further explosions. People are now prohibited from walking within 30 yards around the munitions depot, fearing that unextinguished embers may cause further explosions. (Reuter's Telegram, 25th)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) The disarmament conference scheduled to be held this year, due to the results of the London preparatory meeting, saw the positions of Japan, Britain, and the United States diverge greatly. All countries are observing that the conference will be difficult to succeed. As a result, all countries expect a naval arms race to materialize and have already begun various expansions of military equipment. According to information received by the Ministry of the Navy, the Australian government and the United States jointly established a plan to expand the air force. The main content is as follows: At the British military conference held in Singapore earlier, it was decided that when Australia is attacked by other countries from the northern sea, the 3rd Flying Squadron of New South Wales should arrive at Darwin within a considerable period of time after receiving the first warning. However, the Australian government, feeling the necessity of organizing a strong air force to supplement the weakness of the national air force, jointly established a major air force expansion plan with the United States to be completed before 1936 as part of the British Empire's Pacific defense plan. Thirty-six of the latest bombers and fighters were sent from the UK, of which eighteen have already arrived in Australia, and the rest will be dispatched successively within eighteen months.

<p>(Washington) Senator Pittman, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, predicted today that the Philippines may implement a bimetallic currency system. Pittman said that Filipinos are accustomed to using silver as currency, but the Philippines produces gold worth about 10 million yuan each year. The Philippines has very developed commerce with countries that use gold and silver, which is also conducive to adopting a bimetallic system. However, Filipinos have no difficulty in using the current gold exchange standard, because their financial position makes the currency systems of all countries in the world inferior. When asked about Japan's lack of attention to the silver issue compared to other countries, Pittman replied that the Japanese manage foreign exchange and support their export trade better than any industrial nation. The Japanese can raise or lower the value of the yen within 24 hours, while no foreign country can manipulate the yen. Regarding the amendment of the Philippine Independence Act, Pittman said that the bill includes mandatory and non-mandatory provisions. If Filipinos request to amend the non-mandatory parts of the Independence Act, their attitude before and after would inevitably be inconsistent. However, so far no one has been heard to make such a request, and the current Congress will not discuss the Philippine issue. Finally, Pittman said that the Philippine autonomous constitution is still feasible, and the future of the Philippines is optimistic. (National News Agency Telegram, 24th)</p>

Furthermore, both Belgium and Italy use a virtual gold standard, and their currency values are lower than the French franc.

<p>(Moscow) Dr. Mei Lanfang's Chinese troupe gave its official premiere in Moscow yesterday. Soviet government officials, the diplomatic corps, politicians, and famous figures in the arts, sciences, and cultural circles attended the performance. Before the opening, Zeng Arosi, president of the Cultural Friendship Association, and Dr. Yan Huiqing, the Chinese ambassador, exchanged welcoming speeches. The troupe performed in the music hall, which was filled with enthusiastic spectators. Every time Mei performed a play, the audience cheered enthusiastically.</p>
<p>Radek wrote in Izvestia about his impressions of seeing Mei's performance: "I am a layman when it comes to Chinese drama. I do not know whether it is so different from the struggle of painful life and Chinese customs as shown by the first performance of the Mei Lanfang Troupe. What we saw tonight was completely different from what we know. We are not familiar with the Chinese language and the unique habits of Chinese drama. However, Mei's performance is truly amazing. This person, using a language that is unfamiliar to us, playing the role of a female character, can intoxicate the audience with his magical art, while at the same time producing vivid and believable images. Mei's expressive eyes and the slender gestures of his hands and body make people forget everything, all of which are different from us. Mei's genius can convey centuries of thought, making it understandable to the general public. As for these dramas themselves, they are not only different from our lives, but also unrelated to the Chinese working masses. However, they make us all the more compelled to convey our thoughts to the great Chinese people and their struggle. The genius shown by the Chinese troupe, its love and dedication to labor, if it can be used for the liberation of the Chinese nation, then China will be able to free itself from its shackles and create its new and great art. This kind of art will definitely not be a pure imitation of Western art, but will be able to use the skills and great experience of ancient Chinese art." In conclusion, Radek expressed his sincere welcome to Mei and his companions for being able to show the genius of the Chinese nation in the Soviet Union, and for the Soviet Union's deep sympathy for China's ongoing liberation struggle. Pravda reported that the Chinese troupe's first performance was deeply noted and praised by the Moscow public. The public warmly welcomed the great actor Mei Lanfang, proving that this performance was not an ordinary performance, but a gathering of the world's oldest culture, namely Chinese culture, and the world's youngest and most progressive culture, namely socialist culture. "This glorious performance of the Chinese troupe has become a joyful festival of our cultural alliance, and at the same time, it has become a commemoration of this great actor. Mei's name should enter the ranks of the world's first-class great artists." (TASS Telegram, 24th)</p>

<p>(Gold and Silver) The London gold price today is 145 shillings and 7.5 pence, 5.5 pence lower than Saturday.</p>
<p>The London silver price rose sharply by half a penny today. The spot price is 27.875 pence, and the futures price is 28 pence. The price increase is due to few sales, Indian purchases, and speculative trading. The closing market situation is unstable.</p>
<p>Mountrie Silver: The futures opened high by one point today.</p>
<p>British-American: In the London foreign exchange market, the pound rose slightly due to slight purchases in Europe. The British-American exchange rate opened at $4.7725, 0.125 higher than the British-American closing on Saturday. At 11:00 am, it continued to rise by 0.875 to $4.78125.

<p>Cotton and Wheat:</p>
<p>New York: US Secretary of Agriculture Wallace's statement that the cotton loan program will continue next season, and that the authorities plan to raise sufficient funds so that the new cotton in the next season can be sold without causing price chaos, did not have a major impact on the cotton market this morning. This is probably because Wallace did not specify the exact amount of the loan. The authorities are still paying attention to the issue of cotton exports, and the textile market still does not have an exciting atmosphere, so it is expected that the cotton market will not have a substantial upward trend. The cotton market opened this morning about six points higher than Saturday, but quickly fell back. The market situation was still stable after the price fell.</p>
<p>Chicago Wheat: The opening this morning was more relaxed due to weak overseas prices. The expected rain in the southwestern wheat region has not materialized, but the spring wheat region now has the appearance of a storm.</p>

<p>Dalian Correspondence: After the signing of the illegal transfer of the Chinese Eastern Railway, the Japanese and puppet regimes are actively handling the various procedures for the takeover. At this time, Omura Takuichi, Director of the Kwantung Army Transportation Supervision Department and concurrently Director of the Kwantung Bureau Supervisory Department, along with two Councilor officers, Muraji and Inoue, visited various agencies in Lushun and Dalian as the Director of the Supervisory Department for the first inspection. After arriving in Dalian by train at 1:30 PM on the 15th, Omura Takuichi and others greeted those who welcomed them, and then took a car to the Communications Bureau to inspect the telephone, postal, and telegraph offices, and held discussions with the cadres. Then they stayed at the Yamato Hotel. Regarding the important issues such as the Chinese Eastern Railway after the takeover and the Japanese-puppet postal treaty, Omura Takuichi made the following statement: "After the takeover of the North Railway (i.e., the Chinese Eastern Railway), the railway line will become a major artery for Japan in Manchuria. It can exert great authority in terms of military transportation convenience, and if there is a change in the situation. It should strive to absorb transportation of cargo and passengers during peacetime. In the future, it will be operated uniformly under a consistent policy with other lines, so that it can be subject to the effect of overall control, and it can be determined to use this as a major line in the world's industrial transportation field to fully exert its function. For track modification, to make the north and south consistent, we are currently working on the southern branch line, repairing the line on the one hand, and hoping to obtain economic development in the future in sequence. As for the east and west lines, due to the operation of international trains, it is also necessary to regulate the matters of joint transportation between 'Manchukuo' and the Soviet Union after the takeover. Technical negotiations will be conducted soon, and agreements can also be reached. Furthermore, after the takeover, starting from the dispatching of vehicles, the reconstruction of the station in 'Xinjing' and Harbin, and other facilities along the line will be gradually carried out. What is most concerned about the takeover of the North Railway is the development of the industry of 'Manchukuo,' which is linked to this trunk line, so the promotion of the development of industries in the remote areas of northern Manchuria, the supplementation of social facilities, the cultivation of the line's automobile roads, water transport and the extension of air routes can all be fully planned and considered. It is like other 'national' lines, which should also be consistently consistent throughout, and cooperate with the policy of control. As for the matter of the Japan-'Manchukuo' postal treaty, the specific plan is currently under review in the 'central government,' and the local side also hopes for its early realization, and is in the state of promoting it. Although the correct date for this cannot be stated, it is hoped that it will be established in the near future, because it is based on special relations, although it belongs to the problem between Japan and 'Manchukuo,' it is actually related to international affairs, so the foreign affairs authorities are deeply pondering with a legal point of view, and are always proceeding with a cautious attitude."</p>
<p>Omura Takuichi, Director of the Kwantung Army Transportation Supervision Department and concurrently Director of the Kwantung Bureau Supervisory Department, also visited Zhoushuizi Airport, Dalian Metallurgical Company, Wakakusayama Observatory, Maritime Affairs Bureau, and South Manchuria Railway on the 16th with Muraji and Inoue. On the 17th, he visited the Kwantung State Office and the Lushun Fortress Commander. On the morning of the 18th, he took the Asia Express train at 9 AM to return to Shenyang. After returning to office, he intends to implement the policy he expressed. After the transfer, the East Railway line, because the east and west lines are old and unbearable, it is difficult to meet the needs, so the Japanese and puppet regimes are eager to start repairs. It is heard that in addition to the renovation of bridges, if the lines continue to be laid as before, it can be temporarily delayed for a while, but the Songhua River Railway Bridge is difficult to support if the number of train runs increases compared to the present. The bridge piers and foundations of the bridge have long been weak. If a new building is built, the construction cost will be about 12 million yuan, which is difficult to raise such a huge amount of money at one time. As for the modification of the line, the southern branch line has been scheduled to start implementation on August 1 of this year. As for its method, 30 employees are assigned per kilometer, totaling 1,200 people. The whole line is mobilized, and the change construction work is started simultaneously from about 2 PM, which is completed in three and a half hours, and the new standard track is placed at 5:30 AM.

<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: The Guangzhou-Shaozhou southern section of the Yuehan Railway has been completed and opened to traffic. The project of the section from Shaozhou to Zhuzhou is also progressing actively. A joint meeting of the three sections of the Yuehan Railway was held here recently to discuss the standardization of all equipment and regulations of the entire line to facilitate intermodal transport in each section. Regarding the Zhushao section project, according to Ling Hongxun, Director of the Zhushao Railway Bureau, it has been more than a year since the Zhushao Railway Bureau moved from Guangzhou to Hengzhou. In this year, all 406 kilometers from Zhuzhou to Lechang have started construction. There are more than 100,000 workers working along the road. Recently, about 75% of the earthwork and stonework of the entire section has been completed, about 70% of the tunnels have been completed, about 90% of the retaining walls have been completed, and about 40% of the large and small bridges and culverts have been completed. Zhuzhou, Hengzhou, and Lechang have laid a total of about 65 kilometers of track, and the rest is still being laid. The Guangdong section of the Zhushao section project is the most difficult, because the upstream of the Beijiang River is full of rocky mountains, the route is winding, there are many tunnels, and the water level is shallow, which is not conducive to transportation. The mountain valleys are full of miasma. It is estimated that more than 50 kilometers from Lechang to Pingshi have been under construction since the 22nd year. The ground work has been largely completed, and more than 30 kilometers of track have been laid northward from Lechang. However, there has been a lot of rain in recent months, and the mountainsides have collapsed, which has inevitably affected the project. It is expected that it will take another three months to complete. At that time, the engineering vehicle will directly reach Pingshi, and the project can be considered a small success. Above Pingshi, there is a highway through southern Hunan, leading to Hengzhou and Changsha. For the time being, the highway and railway are intermodal transport, and north-south traffic will be more convenient. As for the Zhushao section railway project, if there are no obstacles, it is expected to open to traffic by the end of the 25th year. In addition, the joint meeting of the three sections of the Yuehan Road continued to be held on the 18th and 19th. If the discussion of each case is completed, it can be closed on the afternoon of the 19th. (March 19)</p>

<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Government announced the regulations on collecting house tax in various counties, which aroused repercussions among the people of the province. After the Yunjian Fellow Villagers Association in Beijing jointly telegraphed the National Government Yuan and the Ministry of the Yangshu Suzhou, Wujin, Wuxi, Yixing, Jiangyin, Taixian and other fellow villagers associations, the chambers of commerce and public groups of various counties in the province unanimously fought for the cancellation. Early telegrams were sent one after another. Now it is heard that the Executive Yuan has handed over the telegrams from all parties to the Ministry of Finance for verification, and the Ministry of Finance has consulted the Jiangsu Provincial Government, saying "House tax is a legal tax revenue of the local government, but it concerns the burden of the people. At this time, the collapse of rural areas, the withering of commerce, and Jiangsu Province suffered a disaster, it should be carefully considered. Now that the government order has just been issued, and the petitions have come one after another, it is not in line with public opinion, and the regulations for collecting house tax have not been approved by the Ministry for transfer and deliberation, which is not in line with the provisions of Articles 3 and 4 of the National Government's Ming Order on June 25 last year on the reorganization of tax and donation methods and the Ministry's Provisional Law on Supervising Local Finances. It should temporarily postpone the implementation of the newly revised house tax regulations to alleviate the hardships of the people." It is said that the provincial government will respect the Ministry's consultation and withdraw its order for this house tax collection regulation.</p>

<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: The red bandits in eastern Fujian are most rampant in Fuan and Lianjiang. After the garrison troops successively captured Ma Lifeng, chairman of the puppet government of eastern Fujian, the remaining major bandits are only Feng Pintai. Recently, Feng's bandits were intercepted by the 11th regiment of the security team near Qiaoyang, and more than 20 bandits were killed. The rest fled to the Luoyuan border, and it was heard that Feng was seriously injured and cared for by five or six of his confidants. Shi Honglie, commander of the New Tenth Division, ordered his departments to conduct guerrilla warfare at any time and leave a considerable team to guard the original defense and strictly seal it off to prevent the bandits from fleeing. Chiang Kai-shek sent a telegram yesterday to commend the division for its success in suppressing bandits in eastern Fujian. As for the important bandit leaders in Lianjiang, such as Ke Chenggui, a long-time pirate in Xiyang Island, Lin Xiaoji, the puppet Lianjiang County Political Committee, Liang Renqin, the puppet secretary, Wu Jianming, the chief of staff of the Southwest Regiment of the puppet Eastern Fujian Independent Division, and Tao Renguan, the puppet political committee, were also captured by the garrison successively. Ke Chenggui was escorted to the province by the 517th regiment of the brigade and handed over to the military law department of the 87th division for interrogation. Wang Boqiu, the first district administrative inspector, submitted a report to the provincial government praising Shen Fazao, the brigade commander of the brigade, for his outstanding achievements in handling the pacification of Lianjiang, in order to show encouragement. The provincial government has approved a special reward of 1,500 yuan to be distributed to the troops. The Eastern Fujian Pacification Headquarters believes that the first phase of the bandit suppression work has been completed, and the second phase of the construction plan should be started immediately. Taking the opportunity of the administrative commissioners of various districts coming to the province to participate in the administrative meeting, yesterday, the administrative commissioners of the first district Wang Boqiu, the second district Xu Hu Hou, and the third district Tang Yintang were convened to discuss the construction plan, and it was decided to complete the traffic highways and liaison telephones of each county in the district in three phases from March to November of this year, as well as the four tasks of implementing the Baojia system, training young men, recruiting civilian troops, and investigating civilian weapons.

<p>Nanchang Communication: Since this province established the Provincial Health Department to manage provincial health administration, the health undertakings have really made great progress. Moreover, Jiangxi Province is the birthplace of the New Life Movement. Pan Ji, the director of the department, has worked hard and paid great attention to the health of the people. He previously renovated the buildings of the Zhangjiang Road Provincial Governor's Office as temporary premises for the Provincial Hospital, but his original plan was to build a large-scale Provincial Hospital. Recently, Director Pan went to Beijing for negotiations several times and has been completed, and he immediately invited tenders in Beijing and signed a contract. It is heard that the construction cost is more than 190,000 yuan, excluding water and electricity equipment. In addition to the funds allocated by the National Economic Commission, the shortage will be subsidized by the Jiangxi Provincial Government.

<p>Anyang Mountain, north of Luquqiao Town in the fourth district of the county, has a majestic shape. In the past, Mo Tianyou, a deputy general of Zhang Shicheng, fought fiercely with the Ming army here. The surrounding earthen fort is towering and the river is surrounded. There are many strange caves and rocks on the mountain, and there are four temples. The day before yesterday was the date of the farmers' festival. Farmers from the four villages went to the mountain to worship, claiming to be 100,000, and handicrafts from nearby villages also gathered here. According to old custom, two plays were performed. Unexpectedly, someone named Liu forced the town chief to report to the county government, and the county magistrate ordered Li Zilong, the patrol officer of the public security branch in charge, to handle it according to the situation. Li immediately led the police to the front of Cuiwei Temple and saw a gambling stall spreading out. He immediately intervened and overturned the gambling stall. More than 200 yuan of bets placed by gamblers on the table were snatched away in the chaos. The villagers immediately rioted. With a cry, thousands of people surrounded the police. As more and more people gathered, the police were unable to break through, so they fired three shots into the sky. When the tourists heard the gunfire, they were even more frightened, crying and shouting loudly, and the order was disrupted. A corner of the wall of Cuiwei Temple was collapsed, injuring one old and one young each. The police took advantage of the situation and went down the mountain and fled to the town office to take refuge. The villagers picked up flat burdens and hoe handles on the stall and chased after them. Two policemen were hit in the head by flying stones. Then the town chief tried his best to persuade the crowd. As a result, the injured treated themselves, and Li patrol officer compensated half of the damaged tables and benches before peace was restored.</p>

<p>Ma Zhenbang, the magistrate of Jiangdu County, because Li Futti of Wangxiang Oil Mill in Shiqiao was robbed by bandits during the winter defense period, and Li Futti was shot and killed, the case has not been solved for a long time. He summoned Zhang Qing'an, the detective of the first investigation team of the Public Security Bureau, Chen Zhiyuan, the detective, and Gao Gui, the acting detective of the second team (Detective Zhu Hui was not released because he was sent to the province in connection with the case). After the speech, he sent the Public Security Bureau to custody and ordered the resolution of major robbery cases in the county. Unexpectedly, Gao Gui suddenly died violently in custody at about 5:00 pm today (24th). Director Zhang immediately reported to the county by telephone. The chief of the county government's Yin section and the doctor of the Red Cross Society rushed to examine the body. The face had turned from red to cyanotic purple, like taking poison. It was also learned that today (24th), his wife, Fan, sent food to the bureau, and Gao talked with him for a long time. Gao cried bitterly, and after his wife left, Gao expressed to Zhang Qing'an, who was in custody with him, that he had been abiding by the law in recent years. Although he died this time, no one extended his grievances. He couldn't close his eyes and entrusted Zhang to give his family considerable assistance in the future because of his daily colleague's friendship. During this sighing conversation, his complexion changed suddenly and he died. In another investigation, the province has another case of suspicion involving Gao Gui, ordering the county to send Gao Gui to the Security Office for interrogation.

<h3 id="e137">Customs Patrol Boat Haihe Sinks, Crew Rescued, Military Supplies Preserved <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>The Haihe, a customs patrol boat assigned by the Jianghai Customs to the Minhai Customs in Fujian last year, encountered fog and drifted while anchored on its way from Shanghai to Fujian this time, resulting in running aground. The general situation has been reported in yesterday's newspaper. Here is a more detailed report:</p>
<p>From Shanghai to Fujian</p>
<p>The Haihe patrol boat, assigned by the Jianghai Customs to the Fujian Minhai Customs, has a displacement of 1,200 tons. The hull was built by the Gaochang Temple Jiangnan Shipyard. When the Customs built five ships last year, this ship was one of them. Its task is to patrol the coast to prevent smuggling and tax evasion. After the ship was completed, it was ordered by the Customs to patrol the Minhai area. The captain is an Englishman named Puhert. There are 38 officers, sailors, and others on board. The ship last came to Shanghai from Fujian for routine repairs at the Jiangnan Shipyard. It was completed and left the factory on the 21st of this month, and sailed back to Minhai from Shanghai.</p>
<p>Truth of the Accident</p>
<p>After the Haihe patrol boat left Shanghai, at 7:30 PM on the 23rd, it had passed the Yanggang Port of Fuzhou and was about to reach Xiamen. The location was at 119 degrees and 42 minutes east longitude and 25 degrees and 42 minutes north latitude. At that time, it was dusk and the sea surface was dark and unclear, resulting in the wrong course. Also, due to fog on the sea, the ship mistakenly ran aground on a reef. The bottom of the ship was broken by the reef, and seawater rushed in. Fortunately, the ship was half-stuck on the reef at the time, so it did not sink immediately, but the situation was very dangerous.</p>
<p>Dispatching Ships for Rescue</p>
<p>After the accident, the shipowner immediately sent a telegram for help. At that time, Taikoo's Yuezhou ship and China Merchants' Haiheng ship received the Haihe's SOS call, and the Xiamen Customs patrol ship Chunxing also received this call for help, and immediately rushed to rescue. Therefore, Yuezhou and Haiheng did not go. When the Chunxing ship arrived at the accident site, the Haihe ship had already been half-submerged in the sea. The Chunxing ship sent sampans to the sea to rescue all 38 crew members of the Haihe ship to its own ship. The three-pound cannon, three machine guns, and the officers and soldiers' pistol bullets on board were also rescued to the Chunxing ship.</p>
<p>Ship Sunk</p>
<p>After the crew and officers of the Haihe ship escaped danger, the water had flooded to the upper deck. Fortunately, there were reefs underneath to support it, so the deck was still exposed. The Chunxing ship was ordered to stay near the Haihe to protect it, to prevent bandits from taking advantage of the lack of ship protection to board the ship and dismantle items. It is heard that the Customs believes that the damage to the ship from running aground is not significant, and it was newly built not long ago, so it has decided to salvage it. The total loss is estimated at 60,000 to 70,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Xiamen, 25th dispatch, reports that the Customs patrol boat Haihe left the province on the 24th and sank near Wuyu Island near Xiamen at night. On the morning of the 25th, Xiamen sent personnel and requisitioned ships to rescue the crew and return. The ship was newly built and the loss is estimated at 500,000.</p>

<p>Ling Hongxun, Director of the Zhushao Section of the Guangdong-Hankou Railway Engineering Bureau, and Yin Deyang, Director of the Hunan-Hubei Administration, and a group of nine people, arrived in Shanghai on the Changxing Company's Empress of Japan ship the day before yesterday. They are scheduled to go to Beijing today or tomorrow to discuss the opening of the entire Guangdong-Hankou Railway with the central government and the Ministry of Railways, and to report on the progress of the project. The reporter of the Shen Shi News Agency interviewed Mr. Ling at the inn and received the following details:</p>
<p>Mr. Ling and His Party Arrive in Shanghai</p>
<p>The construction of the Zhushao section of the Guangdong-Hankou Railway began in the 22nd year and has now been largely completed. The entire line can be opened to traffic by the end of next year. On the 18th of this month, the directors of each section of the railway held a meeting in Guangdong to discuss the opening of the entire line. Ling Hongxun, Director of the Zhushao Section of the Engineering Bureau, Yin Deyang, Director of the Hunan-Hubei Section Administration, and Wang Xicheng, Commissioner of the Ministry of Railways, and a group of nine people, because of important official duties, must consult with the central government and the Ministry of Railways and report on the progress of the entire Guangdong-Hankou Railway project. They arrived in Shanghai from Guangdong the day before yesterday and are scheduled to go to Beijing to visit the authorities today or tomorrow to discuss everything.</p>
<p>Current Status of the Zhushao Project</p>
<p>According to Mr. Ling, who told the reporter yesterday, the Zhushao section of the Guangdong-Hankou Railway project started in July of the 22nd year. All the roadbed and other projects for the 406 kilometers between Zhuzhou and Lechang have been fully started. The number of workers participating in the project along the line has now reached 100,000. As of recently, 75% of the earthwork project for the entire section has been completed, 70% of the tunnel project has been completed, 90% of the retaining wall has been completed, and 40% of the culvert and bridge project has been completed. In summary, 60% of the entire project has been completed. The Guangdong side of the project is more difficult, but now the track laying north of Lechang has reached more than 30 kilometers. In two or three months, the construction vehicle will be able to reach Pingshi.</p>
<p>Full Line to Open Next Year</p>
<p>Mr. Ling continued, after the construction vehicle reaches Pingshi, the project for this section can be considered a small success. There is now a highway connecting Pingshi and Changsha. At that time, railway and highway intermodal transport will be carried out first. The entire Guangdong-Hankou route can be reached in three or four days. The three-section meeting held in Guangdong this time has made detailed decisions on the highway connection methods between Guangdong and Hunan provinces. It is expected that the Zhushao section project can be opened to traffic by the end of next year, barring any unexpected obstacles. In these two years, actively prepare all the equipment for the entire line and unify various rules and regulations so that when the railway project is completed, the administration and facilities of the entire line can be unified. In the future, when the entire line is opened to traffic, the three-section railway bureaus will be merged to establish a general management office to unify authority.</p>
<p>Project Cost is 50 Million</p>
<p>Finally, according to Mr. Ling, the Ministry of Railways needs more than 50 million yuan to complete the entire Guangdong-Hankou line, which is borrowed from the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity fund, with 35 million yuan for labor and 1.65 million pounds for materials. Any deficiencies will be supplemented by the Ministry of Railways. After the entire line is opened to traffic, it will connect to the Ping-Han Railway in the north, becoming a major transportation artery between north and south. It will not only facilitate the transportation of mineral and plant products in the three provinces of Hunan, Hubei, and Guangdong, but also greatly benefit the communication of culture between north and south.</p>

In addition to the principal of 1.68 million yuan that has already been redeemed, the remaining principal is 1.32 million yuan.

<h3 id="e140">Western Landlords Association Held Annual General Meeting Yesterday, Reported on Important Issues Such as Land Value Tax and Rent Reduction, and Re-Elected Beilekeluo and Others as Directors <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>The Dagong News Agency reports that the Shanghai Western Landlords Association held its annual general meeting at 4:00 PM yesterday at the Wu Liande Hall at No. 20 Museum Road. More than thirty members attended. Mr. Sibake presided over the meeting, reporting on important matters such as the collection of land value tax and rent reduction. Then, the directors of this session were elected. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Land Value Tax Issue</p>
<p>After the meeting began, Chairman Sibake reported that before requesting approval of the accounts, he would like to give a brief report on the work of the committee last year. Everyone should still remember that at last year's annual meeting, I mentioned that the Shanghai Municipal Government would collect land value tax on properties outside the Public Concession, and reported to you that the committee had sent a letter to the Consular Body requesting negotiations, and received a reply from the Consular Body stating that it had negotiated with the authorities and would notify you of the results. Since the last annual meeting, the committee has been working tirelessly on this issue, and has not only presented the entire situation to the authorities, but also publicly announced it to various legal organizations to solicit opinions. As of today, we cannot consider this issue to have a satisfactory solution. The attitude of the authorities of some countries is that although their citizens are not legally obligated to pay this land value tax, they still advise them to pay it. At the same time, we are also certain that some citizens of other countries still refuse to pay this tax. What we are concerned about is that this land value tax may contain unequal treatment. This association does not advocate that land outside the concession should be exempt from all land value tax, which must be stated first. However, this association advocates that this land value tax should not have unequal treatment in nature, and a fair and effective appeal committee should be organized, which must be independent in nature and its views must not be biased, so that the relevant owners can appeal the assessed land value for the collection of land tax. In view of the above, regarding the payment of land value tax, please make your own decisions, but in any case, this payment must be accompanied by a protest, stating that it does not affect the rights of the owner.</p>
<p>Reviewing Land Property</p>
<p>At the annual meeting, someone proposed to review the acreage of land property. The area and acreage in the title deeds are often not accurate because the Public Works Department has re-appropriated roads, and there is no clear statement on the title deeds. This matter is very important, especially when estimating its value for setting up mortgages and borrowing money. The committee has contacted the Public Works Department to make the registered owners aware of the accurate acreage in their registered title deeds. The Public Works Department understands this point and agrees to inform the owners of the acreage collected by the bureau for land tax at any time upon written request.</p>
<p>Rent Reduction Issue</p>
<p>Everyone probably hopes that I will express my opinion on the current rent reduction issue. However, regarding this point, I must state that when this association was first established, it was stipulated that "the purpose of this association is not to confront tenants. This association will not sympathize with landlords if the property is unsanitary or dangerous, and this association will not help members increase rents." The purpose of this association is to study matters that affect real estate and are of a public or semi-public nature. The issue of rent is entirely a personal relationship between tenants and landlords. This association cannot formulate any rules for this issue, because the situation is different in different places and cannot be generalized.</p>
<p>Empty House Tax Issue</p>
<p>I do not agree with the collection of empty house police tax. I should ask everyone to note that the police tax is actually a tax that should be borne by the tenant. The owner has already paid land tax to the Public Works Department based on the assessed land value, and this land tax must be paid regardless of whether the property is occupied or not. Therefore, it seems unreasonable to ask the owner to bear the empty house police tax again.</p>
<p>Real Estate Market</p>
<p>Today's real estate market can be said to be temporarily covered by dark clouds. This situation cannot but be attributed to the rising value of silver, but the important reason is actually related to the Sino-Japanese conflict in 1932. Since that incident, the real estate market has never returned to its original state, especially in the eastern and northern districts. Once credit tightens, the signs of decline become more obvious. Previously, owners mortgaged their properties with heavy interest burdens. Now, they are unable to repay the loans or find other ways to raise money, and creditors often exert pressure, resulting in forced sales. Shanghai currently has too many buildings, and the market is not prosperous, so the number of vacant houses is increasing. However, the population of Shanghai is so large and must continue to increase. The current recession is naturally a temporary state, and the vacant houses will soon be occupied. In the view of this association, real estate price declines are common. Today's situation is still a temporary phenomenon. This association does not believe that the population and status of Shanghai will not continue to increase from now on. The construction of houses is not as enthusiastic as before. In the short term, demand can be met with supply. The meeting adjourned.</p>
<p>Re-Elect Directors</p>
<p>After the chairman finished reporting, the directors of this session were re-elected. The names of the elected were as follows: (transliteration) Beilekeluo, Beikai'er, Qiaoluokemeng, Yituolinmeng, Gedeng, Kaipudeng, Kentuo, Kai'en, Laoke, Luonas, Mahan, Tongnada, Miskeng, Pailansideng, Lubinson, Sedasimis, Spaike, Siyaji, Lipaisun, Huierxun.</p>
<h3 id="e141">Asahi Plane Flew Back to Osaka Yesterday Morning, Mayor Wu and Representatives Arrived to See Them Off <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>The Osaka Tokyo Asahi Shimbun's visiting plane to China was originally scheduled to fly back to Osaka at 9:00 AM the day before yesterday, but because Osaka telegraphed that the weather along the Japanese coast was poor, which could hinder the flight, it was postponed to 8:00 AM yesterday to take off from Longhua Airport and return to Japan. The Municipal Government and the Garrison Headquarters still sent many security teams and police officers to stand guard along Jingji Road, reaching the airport to protect them. Those who went to see them off included Wang Changchun, a specialist from the Municipal Government representing Mayor Wu, as well as Yang Hu, Director of the Municipal Security Department, Li Dachao, Director of the First Department of the Municipal Government, Secretary Zhang Tingrong, Chief of Staff Gan of the Garrison Headquarters, Adjutant Gan, as well as representatives of the Japanese Consulate and the Shanghai Asahi Shimbun, representatives of the Japanese community, and dozens of others. The Public Security Bureau also sent a band to the airport to play music. At around 7:00, the two pilots, Xinye and Tsukakoshi, arrived at the airport to inspect the aircraft. It was discovered that a part of the copper tube for transporting oxygen had been burned out, which prevented the engine from starting. The pilot asked the American engineer from the China National Aviation Corporation to provide equipment, which delayed the originally scheduled departure time by one hour. According to Xinye, who spoke to the reporter from the Central News Agency, the plane will cross the East China Sea and fly directly to Osaka over the Goto Islands and north of Nagasaki, with the entire journey taking about six hours. It should arrive at around 3:00 PM, but the sea flight will only take two and a half hours. At 9:10, the two pilots shook hands with the people who came to see them off and said goodbye one by one, and thanked the engineers from the China National Aviation Corporation. Then, they drove the plane into the air, circled the airport once, and then flew towards the northeast.</p>
<p>The Osaka Electric News Agency reported on the 25th that the Asahi Shimbun plane continued its smooth flight and arrived safely at the Osaka Joto Training Ground Airport at 3:21 PM (2:21 PM Shanghai time), taking five hours and twenty-one minutes, which was earlier than expected.</p>
<h3 id="e142">Shi Qingyang Passed Away Yesterday in Shanghai; Funeral Set for 11 AM on the 28th <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, Mr. Shi Qingyang, former Chairman of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission, participated in the revolution in his early years and made numerous contributions. After assuming the position of Chairman of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission, he devoted particular effort to planning border affairs, which eventually led to overwork and illness. In mid-February, he requested leave to come to Shanghai, staying at the New Asia Hotel. He sought treatment from traditional Chinese medicine practitioner Wu Peiheng, but his condition did not improve. Relatives and friends often advised him to seek treatment in a hospital, but Mr. Shi declined, citing the high cost of hospital care. Coincidentally, Mr. Huang Musong returned from Tibet, and the Central Government approved Mr. Shi's resignation. Following further persuasion from relatives and friends, he entered Baolong Hospital for treatment on March 10th. After an X-ray examination, it was discovered that his lungs were completely damaged, reaching the final stage of pulmonary disease. He was hospitalized for two weeks without improvement and passed away at 5 PM yesterday. His remains were moved to the Chinese Funeral Home at 6 PM, and the funeral is scheduled for 11 AM on the 28th. Mr. Shi was 57 years old and is survived by his wife, two sons, and seven daughters. His second wife is currently pregnant. His eldest son, Zhenru, is in his hometown of Ba County, Sichuan. His second son went to Italy last year to study at the military academy. His eldest daughter is married to Mr. Pan, the current Director of the Revenue Bureau of Fengdu County, Sichuan. The remaining five daughters and one son are all young and still in school. Mr. Shi's two wives came to Shanghai last week to attend to him during his illness. They were extremely grief-stricken at the Chinese Funeral Home yesterday. Mr. Shi's younger brother, Shi Nanyang, who works for the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission, has come to Shanghai from Beijing, along with Mr. Shi's old friends, Yi Yuchang and Xie Bocheng, secretaries of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission, to jointly handle the funeral arrangements. It is said that Mr. Shi's remains will be buried in Nanjing.</p>
<h3 id="e143">Xu Fu Arrived in Shanghai by Plane Yesterday <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Xu Fu, Director of the Finance Department of Fujian Province, arrived in Shanghai yesterday from Fuzhou on the Shanghai-Guangdong line northbound flight. He landed at Longhua Airport at 2 PM and then went to his private residence for rest. Mr. Xu will stay in Shanghai for a few days before going to Beijing to meet with the authorities.</p>
<h3 id="e144">Art Exhibition Artifacts Shipped to England; Caretaker Selection Still Undecided <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>Since the Shanghai pre-exhibition of the London Chinese League of Nations Art Exhibition was actively prepared by the Preparatory Committee, most of the work is now nearing completion. Various artifacts began to be displayed on the 22nd of this month. Recent reports in various newspapers have been quite inaccurate. The reporter visited Tang Xifen, the secretary of the committee, yesterday, who provided the following corrections: (1) The British side originally planned to send five special commissioners to China. Four have already arrived in China: David, Beate, El Hobsbawn, and O'Mofolos. Professor Heber will arrive tomorrow. No other commissioners have been dispatched. (2) The safety measures for shipping artifacts to England were decided by the Preparatory Committee, not by the Artifacts Preservation Committee. (3) When the artifacts are shipped to England in the future, our side should send personnel to take care of them. The selection of personnel has not yet been decided. (4) The duration of the pre-exhibition will be decided by the Preparatory Committee after all arrangements are completed. (5) The statement that all slightly valuable artifacts are rejected during the selection process is incorrect. Our people often consider whether they can represent Chinese art as the most important factor when selecting artifacts.</p>
<h3 id="e145">Municipal Chamber of Commerce Cables Ministry of Finance: Requesting Exemption of Stamp Duty for Acceptance Bills; Said Bills Are for Relief of the City and More Effective Than Checks <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce cabled the Ministry of Finance in Nanjing yesterday, stating, "To the esteemed Nanjing Ministry of Finance, we received letters from the Silk and Satin Industry Association and the Electrical Silk Weaving Factory Industry Association on the 23rd of this month, stating that due to the decline of the silk industry and the exhaustion of finance, the associations are vigorously promoting commercial acceptance bills to improve the lending system and relieve the stagnation of currency. Several members have already implemented it. Whether it can achieve the purpose of increasing currency circulation is still in its initial stage, and no results have been seen yet. However, although this acceptance bill has the name of a bill of exchange, it is different from ordinary bills of exchange remitting money from place A to place B. It is only a basis for the agreed payment period in a transaction between two parties. Therefore, even if this acceptance bill is issued during the transaction, the invoice and receipt still need to be opened and affixed with stamps. According to the stamp tax regulations, only bills of exchange and checks are listed, and there is no special term for acceptance bills. If stamp duty is also affixed according to the bill of exchange example, the amount will be very large, not only will the effectiveness of the advocacy not be seen, but the heavy burden of stamp duty will increase sharply, which is contrary to the original purpose of relieving exhaustion and is difficult to bear. Moreover, the stamp tax regulations list checks, which have been ordered by the Ministry to be suspended, and bank and money shop promissory notes are also not affixed with stamps. Therefore, acceptance bills should also be exempt from stamp duty to save the decline of industry and commerce. We hereby jointly send this letter to your association, earnestly requesting that you forward it to the government for a reasonable request, begging for approval, and ordering that all newly advocated commercial acceptance bills be exempt from stamp duty, which is extremely hoped for. We have found that the city is in extreme difficulty due to the impact of the world economic depression and the bankruptcy of rural areas in the country. Industry and commerce are depreciating, and the dangerous situation is unprecedented. The subordinate associations have reported to your Ministry, requesting relief. On the one hand, due to the financial difficulties of the public treasury, we urge merchants to quickly plan self-help methods. The associations have taken the initiative to try commercial acceptance bills, intending to expand the credit system so that the market can have capital to turn around. This commercial acceptance bill is a matter that has been prepared for implementation recently. The original tax source of stamp duty is inherently unaffected. As for its intention to assist the government and relieve the market, it should be more effective than the checks that have been temporarily exempted from stamp duty in the past. The association's request to be exempt from stamp duty is for the purpose of encouraging the commercial acceptance bills that are being advocated and tried. It is reasonable to telegraph your Ministry for review and approval, which is truly convenient for the public. Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce kowtows."</p>

<h3 id="e147">China General Federation of Industry: Starts Soliciting National Labor Representatives; Please Ask Members to Study Neighbor Girl Inflation; Secretary-General Qian Chengxu Returns to Shanghai from Shandong <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>The China General Federation of Industry, in view of the approaching session of the National Labor Conference, has specifically written to members across the country, requesting them to recommend representatives so that they can be nominated. It also hopes that members will join in studying inflation. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>National Labor Representative Please Appoint with Senior Rank</p>
<p>The federation believes that the National Labor Conference representative is related to the entire country. In previous sessions, the government lacked guarantees for the representatives, which reduced the effectiveness of international negotiations. It has specifically requested the Executive Yuan to grant senior-rank appointments to all representatives from this session onward, so that they can facilitate international labor disputes. The Executive Yuan has recently approved this. The federation specifically issued a notice yesterday morning, requesting national member organizations to quickly elect representatives so that they can be nominated and appointed before the session.</p>
<p>Continue to Study Inflation</p>
<p>The federation convened the second executive headquarters meeting in February and decided to address inflation. Now, Zhang Naiqi and others have submitted a research report. The federation specifically informed all members, stating: "We are writing to inform you that the domestic financial situation has become increasingly serious since June 1934, and the position of our industrial sector has become even more difficult as a result. In February of this year, the federation convened the second executive headquarters meeting and decided to establish an economic expert committee in accordance with the constitution, and hired Zhang Naiqi of Zhejiang Industrial Bank, Yang Yinpu of Zhejiang Xingye Bank, and Zhang Xiaomei of Bank of China to specialize in researching various industrial and economic issues related to current affairs, so that members can consult at any time and learn from each other. We are grateful for the kindness of Mr. Zhang, Yang, and Zhang, who have agreed to accept the appointment of our federation and have answered the various inflation questions inquired by our federation one by one, which are in line with today's needs. In addition to recording and distributing them, we also hope that your members will convey them to their colleagues in the factory. If you are interested in joining the economic expert committee of our federation and doing research work, please indicate your name. We welcome you very much." The federation's Secretary-General Qian Chengxu returned to Shanghai yesterday.</p>
<h3 id="e148">Ministry of Finance: Reply to the Pippi Silk Tobacco Industry Association; Old System Tax Tickets Permitted for Accommodation Within Three Months <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Pipi Silk Tobacco Industry Association submitted a request to the Tax Affairs Department on the 12th of this month, stating that during the transition period of Yongding's change to special tax, tobacco products that have paid the old tax and are shipped should be allowed to be offset as before within three months, which has been recorded in this newspaper. It is now known that the association has received a reply from the Ministry of Finance approving it. The original reply is recorded below: "Your presentation has been noted. It is verified that before the special tax was changed in the Tingzhou area of Fujian Province, when local tobacco leaves and their processed tobacco silk from the area were transported into the special tax zone, the first-level special tax authorities at the entry point should levy the special tax. Those who have paid the public sale fee tax in the place of origin are also allowed to verify the evidence and offset the special tax, up to two yuan per piece of 67 city catties. After the special tax on local tobacco leaves in the area is implemented, all local tobacco leaves and their processed tobacco silk that have been paid special tax, when transported and sold to the special tax zones of various provinces, should be verified and released in accordance with the special tax regulations. As for the public sale fee tax receipts printed by the counties in Tingzhou, they should be abolished immediately. This has been communicated by the Ministry successively for compliance. Now, according to the association, Yongding and other areas in Tingzhou have not been changed to special tax for a long time. For all tobacco products that have paid the public sale fee tax and obtained the receipt to ship, when they arrive in the special tax zones of various provinces, please allow them to offset the special tax as before within three months to alleviate the merchants' difficulties. After verification, it is still feasible. It is temporarily allowed to be accommodated, but the old tax certificate should be limited to those who have paid the tax and issued it before February 15th of this year, when the Ministry ordered the abolition of the public sale fee tax receipts in the area. In addition to separate orders, you should immediately inform all colleagues to comply. This reply."</p>

More than 40 members attended. The Municipal Party Department and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent Zhu Yakui and Yuan Hongjun to attend and guide. They arrived one after another at 6 PM and immediately rang the bell to start the meeting. The association prepared dinner and discussed the proposals at the table.

<p>The first group wedding ceremony, organized by the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau under orders, is scheduled to be held in the Municipal Government Auditorium on the 3rd of next month. Because it is the first time, it is feared that the etiquette and ceremony may not be skilled. A ritual rehearsal will be held once in the afternoon of the day before the wedding ceremony (April 2nd). The second group wedding is set for 30 couples and started registration from the 10th of this month. The deadline is the 3rd of this month. Outsiders suspect that the registration for the second session must be held after the first session. In fact, it is not. It is heard that the bureau advocates that the registration for the second session will end on the 31st of this month and will not be extended again. There are not many days left. Those who want to register should not delay and mislead themselves again.</p>

<p>The First Labor Nursery, organized by the Shanghai Children's Happiness Association, has achieved excellent results since it started entrusting children last month, reducing the burden on the laboring class and creating many benefits. However, given the size of Shanghai and the large number of laboring people, the nursery, in view of the large number of people who continue to request admission to the nursery, plans to expand its capacity in the near future. According to news from the nursery yesterday, most of the children currently entrusted in the nursery are from service industries, and the rest are workers. The current 30 places will be increased again, and night childcare will be carried out. Because it is inconvenient to take care of children when working night shifts, there are special arrangements. In addition, as soon as funding is available in the future, a second nursery can also be realized.</p>

<h3 id="e155">Chongming County Issues Statement Regarding Detention of Dalian Steamer <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>The Chongming County Government sent a letter to this newspaper, stating, "We are writing to inform you that the headline of the news column on page 11 of your newspaper on the 22nd of this month, 'Chongming County Detains Dalian Steamer for Smuggling Opium,' stated, 'The Dalian Steamer arrived in Chongming from Shanghai in January of this year. When it arrived at the port, police officers from the Public Security Bureau found 1,000 packages of smuggled opium in the accounting room. The drugs were confiscated, and the county government lightly fined the shipowner. Unexpectedly, recently, an order from the superior asked to re-open the old case, and the Dalian Steamer was placed under police guard and detained, and Chongming was not allowed to sail,' etc. This case occurred on February 2nd. According to the report from the First Sub-Bureau of the County Public Security Bureau, smuggled opium was found on the steamer, and the seized opium was submitted to the county. However, the original贓物 only had two packages, not a thousand packages. The county government did not arrest the trafficker on the spot and, in addition to strictly limiting the time to solve the case, summoned all suspected persons to the county for interrogation and detained or bailed them out separately. As for the current detention of the Dayun Steamer, it is in accordance with the instructions of the Provincial Anti-Smoking Committee to order the county to send personnel to handle the entire case. It has not yet been concluded, and there is absolutely no fact of fines. It is feared that the outside world will spread rumors and cause misunderstandings. The discrepancies are specifically and solemnly stated, and we ask your newspaper to publish them in the original column to correct them and clarify the truth. We are extremely grateful.

<h3 id="e158">Resident Association Director, Korean Lee Yong-ro Assassinated; Two Murderers Arrested on the Spot; Lee's Wife Slightly Injured and Unharmed <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>Lee Yong-ro, a director of the Korean Residents Association in this city, lived at No. 16 Yuxing Lane, Dixiwei Road. In addition to Lee's wife, there was also an apprentice in the house. The whole family was only these three people. At about 7 AM yesterday morning, Lee had two friends, also Koreans, who came to visit. At that time, Lee had not yet gotten up. Lee's wife opened the door and welcomed them in. One by one, they went upstairs together. According to the visitors, they were inviting Lee to a meeting. As soon as they reached the top of the stairs and said a word, one of them took out a pistol from his sleeve and fired two shots at Lee, hitting Lee's head. Lee's wife heard the sound and went to see, but she was so frightened that she could not make a sound. One of the murderers took a kitchen knife from the table and cut Lee's wife, but the injury was not fatal and not serious. The two murderers fired two more shots as a warning before escaping. At that time, a chauffeur used by the neighboring house at No. 15 heard the gunshots and went out to see. He happened to see the two murderers fleeing in a hurry. He followed them and reported them to the nearby police on duty, who captured the two murderers and took them to the Linping Road police station for temporary detention. On the other hand, a ambulance was called to Lee's house. Because he was Korean, he was immediately sent to the Japanese Fumin Hospital for treatment. However, because the injury was in a vital area and he lost too much blood, the treatment was ineffective, and he died at 10 AM. Lee's wife was injured in the arm, but it was a minor injury. She was bandaged and discharged from the hospital. The two murderers have now been transferred to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for interrogation. It is learned that one is named Lu Hengdun and the other is Li Kuihu. The Japanese Consulate has sent personnel to extradite them. The police station is afraid that the assassination still has a mastermind or other premeditated criminals. The interrogation situation has not been announced for the time being. However, the mutual assassination of Koreans may have a political background, which is also unknown.</p>
<p>The Great American Evening News reported that a Korean named Lee, a consultant to the Korean Overseas Association in Shanghai, who lived in Yuxing Lane, outside Dixiwei Road, near Kulun Road, was shot and killed by two unknown Koreans this morning (the 25th). The murderers could not escape because they were stopped by Lee's wife and another young Korean. The police of the Public Security Bureau rushed to the scene upon hearing the news and arrested the two people and sent them to the Zhabei Police Station. They will be transferred to the Japanese Consul General's Office. According to Lee's wife, the two people had a letter of introduction from a friend in Nanjing and wanted to see someone named Jin, who received them. Then, a certain husband and another young man also arrived. She felt that the visitors were suspicious, so she shouted for help. One of the two immediately pulled out a gun and shot her husband, hitting him in the back of the neck. Although he was rushed to Fumin Hospital for treatment, he died of his injuries shortly after.?</p>
<h3 id="e159">Telephone Price Increase Issue: Branch of Citizens’ Group in 37 Districts Sends Letter Requesting Prevention; Telephone Company Will Review and Reduce New Regulations <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>The branch of the citizens’ group in 37 districts held its 22nd executive committee meeting yesterday, chaired by Sun Wenyi, recorded by Zhang Donghou. After the ceremony, the chairman reported that many members had sent letters requesting that the Public Concession be requested to prevent the telephone price increase. After deliberation, it was unanimously passed. The original letter is recorded below: “We are writing to inform you that we have received letters from the majority of our members stating that the Shanghai Telephone Company is about to increase telephone prices again. The members are alarmed when they hear this in the current economic downturn. Recently, the market has been depressed, the economy has been exhausted, stores have closed, and factories have stopped work. Everywhere is like this. Therefore, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, in view of the fact that Shanghai, which has always been known as a prosperous commercial port, is about to be hit and collapse, is trying to find a way to rescue it. The citizens’ group also has a rent reform movement to relieve the people’s difficulties and hope to recover. The Shanghai Telephone Company does not think that the telephone is a public transportation business and should be cheap and popular. It must never be compared with ordinary businesses, which are only profit-oriented. However, the company is taking advantage of its authority and recklessly disregards the fact that industry and commerce are in danger, and is about to increase prices again. The members cannot afford it. Please ask your association to send a letter to the Nahan Chinese Association, and forward it to the Public Concession to quickly prevent the price increase, so as to eliminate the people’s difficulties and make the market prosperous.” After the meeting, it was adjourned.</p>
<p>The Great American Evening News reported that the Shanghai Telephone Company has reduced the 22.89% increase in telephone fees requested by the Public Concession to 12.5%, so it has revised the fee schedule according to this rate and submitted it to the Public Concession. It is said that the number of applications to reduce the increase in commercial and private telephone fees has not yet been known. It is expected that the number of commercial telephone fees and residential telephone fees originally used 100 times will be reduced. The implementation of the new chapter must be approved by the French Public Works Bureau. It is said that the Public Works Bureau’s Public Utilities Committee will discuss this matter on Monday. The new chapter was originally scheduled to be implemented on April 1st, but the Public Concession has no regular meeting before April 1st, so the revised regulations may be distributed to the directors of the Public Concession without holding a formal meeting. The Public Concession may add approval at the next regular meeting, so that the new chapter can be implemented from April 1st.</p>

<p>The eighth day of the fourth month of the lunar calendar is commonly known as the Bathing Buddha Festival. The ancient Jing'an Temple in this city has traditionally held temple fairs for a long time. As the festival approaches, stall owners began registering yesterday. The following is a notice from the Joint Association of Buddha's Birthday Stall Owners: "To all members of the Association, those who wish to set up stalls for the Buddha's Birthday Festival must register with the Association within this temple from today and obtain a certificate before receiving a license. This is a special announcement." It is also understood that the area for setting up stalls this year will remain from Hart Road in the east to Hardoon Road in the west. It is understood that the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession, in view of the Jing'an Temple fair being held for a week each year, believes that it affects traffic. This year, it intends to only allow four days, but the Joint Association of Stall Owners is currently negotiating with the Municipal Council to continue holding it for a week as in previous years.</p>
<h3 id="e161">Ma Hongkui's Death: Family Disputes Property, Ma's Wife Sues Husband's Brother and Husband's Concubine <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>Ma Fuqi (also known as Gu Fuqi, who married into the Ma family and changed his surname to Ma), a local resident of Doutou Lane, 183 Rue Virmont, French Concession, and his wife, Ma Agui, were rickshaw pullers during their lifetime and contracted for cleaning services in the British and French Concessions and the Nanshi area for many years. They had considerable savings and acquired extensive real estate in the French Concession. As land prices increased year by year, their property also increased to no less than several million. Ma Fuqi and Ma Agui had three sons: Hongkui, Hongsheng, and Honggen, all of whom were married and had children. Ma Fuqi and Ma Agui passed away several years ago, one after the other. Their business was inherited by their three sons, and the eldest son, Hongkui, managed the estate without dividing it. Unfortunately, Hongkui died of lung disease on the twelfth day of the eighth month of last year (the third day of the seventh month of the lunar calendar), joining his parents in the afterlife. He left behind his wife, Chen, his concubine, Wang, a son named Lusen, and two daughters named Luying and Luzhen, all of whom are young. They are currently being raised by their uncles, Hongsheng and Honggen. Recently, Hongkui's widow, Ma Chen, suddenly hired lawyers such as Wang Yintai and filed a lawsuit in the Criminal Division of the Second Special District Local Court, accusing her husband's brother, Ma Honggen, and her husband's concubine, Wang Ada (also known as Ma Yuezhen), of encroaching on the estate. She requested that they be interrogated according to the law. The court, based on the complaint, specially opened the Second Criminal Division yesterday morning at 10:30, presided over by Judge Qiu Huanxing, to summon and examine the parties. Both sides arrived with their lawyers. First, the plaintiff, Ma Chen, stated that she was 40 years old, a native of Shanghai, and currently residing in Guifu Lane, Baer Road. The judge asked, "What are you accusing the defendants of?" She replied, "I am accusing them of swallowing my husband's share of the estate." She explained that after her parents-in-law died, the estate was not divided. On the third day of the seventh month of last year, when her husband was dying, his concubine, Wang Ada (also known as Ma Yuezhen), forcibly took her husband's Shanghai Bank safe deposit box key, seal, and bankbook and gave them to her third brother, Honggen. At this point, her lawyer stood up and stated on behalf of Chen that the case was divided into two parts: (1) The plaintiff's husband had a private fortune of about 500,000 in gold, including two boxes of gold pounds, each box seven inches long, two inches high, and three inches wide, and two bankbooks with a total of 26,000 yuan, as well as stacks of ten-yuan banknotes about ten feet long, totaling over 200,000, all stored in bank safe deposit boxes, which were later taken by the defendants. (2) The plaintiff's parents-in-law's estate included real estate in Kangji Lane, Kandi Road, and Gujia Garden, as well as a jointly operated cleaning business in the British, French, and Chinese areas, which generated tens of thousands of gold coins per month, and many rickshaws, totaling a fortune of two to three million gold coins. There were many types, and it was impossible to count them all at once." The judge asked Ma Chen how much the estate was worth. She replied that it was about four million. When questioned, the defendant Ma Honggen stated that when his elder brother Hongkui was ill and died, he was recuperating in Hangzhou. Upon hearing the news, he came to Shanghai. The lawyer Lu Zhenyu handed over all the keys managed by his elder brother to the old accountant Fan Sanduo, together with the plaintiff Chen and her brother Guangyu, to go to the Shanghai Bank and open all three safe deposit boxes belonging to his elder brother for inspection and registration. However, at that time, because the space in the safe deposit box room was small, he stood far away and did not know the details of all the items in the boxes. Later, the plaintiff and lawyer Wang went to open it again. Moreover, all the property in the family after my mother's death was managed by my elder brother and the old accountant Wan Sanduo, and I never interfered. Wang Ada (also known as Ma Yuezhen) stated that she was Hongkui's concubine. When her husband was dying, Chen wanted to seize the key to the silver box, but her husband refused. Later, he handed it over to Wan Sanduo for safekeeping. After her husband died, there was only 30,000 yuan in property, and there was a will stating that it should be divided into three shares, with the woman and Chen each receiving 10,000, and the two daughters, Luying and Luzhen, each receiving 5,000. At this point, the judge summoned the witness Wan Sanduo, but his son came on his behalf, saying that his father was ill and could not come to court. The court then instructed that the witness Wan Sanduo's home would be visited by the court this Wednesday for questioning, and the hearing would be rescheduled. The plaintiff's lawyer requested the court to detain the defendants or order them to post bail. The defendant's lawyer objected, saying that the defendants had a high status and that the plaintiff had not provided any detailed evidence for the charges, so there was no need for detention. The judge also argued that detaining the defendant and ordering bail was a matter for the judge to weigh and should not be disputed. He also announced that the hearing would be adjourned until April 6 and then adjourned.</p>

<p>Chinese and Western detectives from the Xinzha Police Station raided a red pill den selling opium substitutes at 147 Siwen Lane, Datong Road, at 9:20 the night before. Jiangbei native Ma Deliang and Shandong native Tian Changpo were arrested, and two bags of red pills (18 taels), an opium pipe for smoking red pills, a lamp, 35 silver dollars, and an account book were seized. Tian Changpo confessed that he had sold red pills to Ma Deliang and was collecting the debt today. He also stated that he had purchased all the red pills from the Jiang Fengzhi doctor's building at 565 Sichuan Road. Chinese and Western detectives immediately went to Sichuan Road to search. They arrested a Ningbo native, Zhang Bingkang, at the entrance. Zhang took out the key, opened the door, and went inside. Seven seals, three account books, and three receipts were seized. They then went to 11, Lane 211, Haining Road, where they seized three bags of red pills (three pounds), a bag of sugar, a bag of flour, a bag of coffee, a can of red dye, and a sign for the Tongtai Company. However, no suspects were arrested. Finally, they went to the manufacturing den at 12, Lane 27, Youheng Road, where they arrested three Ningbo natives, Bao Baokang, Chen Acai, and Xu Asi. They seized ten pill-drying plates, 70 pounds of sugar, 35 pounds of coffee, two bags of red pills (one and a half pounds), a bottle of strong acid, a sieve, a set of red pill machines, two signs for the Tongtai Company, and several pill boards. All the items were taken back to the police station and detained separately. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Eighth Criminal Division of the First Special Court. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin prosecuted according to Article 6 of the Anti-Smoking Law and described the raid, stating that the main suspect was still at large, so he requested a postponement for further investigation. After Judge Liu Yugui questioned each of the defendants, he instructed them to be remanded in custody pending further hearing.</p>

<p>At around 6:00 PM yesterday, a robbery occurred on British Route No. 9 bus traveling between Jing'an Temple and Yangshupu. The two robbers were wearing blue cloth short shirts and pants, looking like workers in their forties. They boarded the bus midway, bought tickets to Yangshupu, and looked like ordinary passengers, so there was no reason to suspect them. When the bus reached Ningwu Road, the men suddenly stood up and pretended to get off. The ticket seller opened the door for them. Unexpectedly, one of the men suddenly pulled out a sharp knife, threatening the ticket seller and gesturing to stab him. The ticket seller was unarmed and unable to resist, so he was subdued. At that moment, the other man took the opportunity to grab the ticket money bag from his shoulder, jumped out of the bus, and fled to a secluded place. The ticket seller was unable to catch him and rushed to report to the police station, requesting an investigation and arrest. He also reported to the company.</p>

<p>At around 5:30 the night before, in front of 169 Dong Street inside Xiaodongmen, a young man was suddenly found trying to hang himself in secret. The local patrol officer Zuo Deshen happened to see him and immediately rushed forward, saved him, and took him to the police station. According to the young man's statement to the station chief Liu Yunfang, "Chen Gengsheng, 26 years old, from Changzhou, came to Shanghai a few days ago to seek employment because of the difficult life in his hometown, but he was unsuccessful. His travel expenses were swindled, and he had no money, no place to live, and no way to make a living. He could not return home, so he was desperate and resorted to this measure to avoid hardship and pain." After verifying the statement, Chief Liu determined that the case was related to suicide and ordered Chen Gengsheng to be sent to the General Bureau with a written document yesterday for assistance. It was heard that Gu Guan, the director of the Relief Section of the Second Department, questioned him and sent him to the Changzhou Shanghai Hometown Association for handling.</p>

<p>Pan Xiqi and Lu Taosheng, carpenters from Songjiang who lived in a bungalow in Lujiazhai, Guiyang Road, resorted to robbery at night due to difficult living conditions. They used wooden fake pistols and axes to rob pedestrians of their belongings or strip them of their clothes (commonly known as "killing pigs"). On the 22nd of this month, a Taizhou native, Cai Shaoqing, was passing by when the two men shone a flashlight on his face. Cai was alert and ran away, avoiding being robbed. The next day, he reported to Yangshupu Police Station detective Liu Changgen. That evening, Liu and Detective Liu went to the area disguised as villagers. As they passed by, Pan and Lu rushed out and blocked their way, again shining a flashlight on their faces, ordering them to stop and hand over their belongings, and using a fake pistol to threaten them into silence. Detective Liu, who was burly, rushed forward, pulled out his real gun, and shouted, "How dare you commit such crimes! Put your hands up and surrender!" Pan and Lu panicked, dropped the fake pistol and axe into a small creek, and tried to escape. They were caught and taken to the police station for detention. The gun and axe were also retrieved from the creek. Yesterday, they were sent to the Third Criminal Division of the First Special Court. Municipal Council lawyer Li Zhishan detailed the case and requested a postponement for investigation and filing. Liu Hua and Cai Shaoqing also reported the details of the incident and presented the gun, axe, and flashlight for inspection. When questioned, the two defendants gave evasive answers. Judge Jiang Shuzi ordered them to be remanded in custody pending further investigation.</p>

<h3 id="e167">Yu Hengqiu's Audacious Actions: Impersonating a Military Officer to Defraud People of Property, Captured by Haiheng Ship Crew <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Haiheng ship, returning to Shanghai from Shantou and Guangzhou this time, discovered a fraudster named Yu Hengqiu impersonating a military officer upon arrival in Shanghai. A large number of forged official documents and seals of the Ministry of Military Affairs, Chiang Kai-shek's personal seal, and various symbols were seized. He has been handed over to the Water Police Station and will be sent to court for interrogation. The details of this incident are as follows:</p>
<p>Impersonating a Military Officer: On the 27th of last month, the Haiheng ship sailed from Shanghai to Shantou and Guangzhou for the seventh time. At that time, a young military officer boarded the ship wearing a uniform and the insignia of Yu Jian, Section Chief of the First Section of the Ordnance Department of the Army Ministry. When boarding the ship, he purchased a second-class ticket, requesting a half-price ticket in the name of a military officer. After boarding the ship, he was very close to the crew. According to him, he was ordered by the Central Government to go to Guangdong to collect a large sum of money from Chen Jitang. He claimed that he had been selected by the Ministry of Military Affairs to study ordnance abroad, and the tuition fee of 40,000 yuan had been approved by the three ministries of military affairs, foreign affairs, and industry, with 15,000 yuan allocated by the Central Government and the remaining 25,000 yuan to be supplemented by Chen Jitang of Guangdong. Chen Jitang had already agreed to pay, and he was going to collect this large sum of money. He then took out a training order for 40,000 yuan of tuition fees jointly issued by the three ministries of military affairs, foreign affairs, and industry, as well as a passport for Yu Jian, Section Chief of the First Section of the Ordnance Department of the Ministry of Military Affairs, and a certificate of scholarship for students in the United States issued by the Central Government. The crew did not know it was fake and believed it to be true, showing great respect for Yu Jian.</p>
<p>Scamming Money on the Ship: Yu Jian was a young and promising man, eloquent, and a good writer. He got along well with the crew on the Haiheng ship. Yu's intentions were deep. He first gave small gifts to people to get close. There were also frequent banquets between the crew and passengers on the ship. Three of the crew members, Zheng, Su, and Li, often chatted with Yu Jian. Unexpectedly, Yu Jian took an inch and wanted a mile, using this opportunity to cheat people out of money. He said that he was going to Guangdong to collect a large sum of money for his scholarship, but he had to leave Beijing in a hurry and did not bring much travel money. He asked to borrow some money from each of them temporarily, and once he received 25,000 yuan, he would return it. The crew did not suspect that he was deceiving them. Zheng lent him 89 yuan, and Li lent him 10 yuan.</p>
<p>Scamming in Shanghai: In five or six days on the ship, Yu learned the history of each crew member. He even inadvertently learned the addresses of Zheng and Su's family members and the situation of their relatives and friends. Unexpectedly, after arriving in Guangdong, Yu disappeared from the Haiheng and returned to Shanghai on another ship. He then impersonated Su and Zheng to swindle money from their relatives and friends such as Hu Yumo. At the same time, he used the crew members' business cards to swindle and deceive outside. The Haiheng crew members did not know it at first. Later, they received inquiries from their relatives and friends and realized that Yu was a con artist. They immediately telegraphed Shanghai to inform their family members not to be fooled. Some of the crew members also sent someone on the Taikoo ship to return to Shanghai to investigate the matter.</p>
<p>Walking Right Into the Net: At 3:00 PM on the 24th, the Haiheng ship returned to Shanghai from Nanhua. As soon as the ship docked at the Nan Dock, the con artist Yu Jian, impersonating a military officer, was found lurking at the Jinliyuan Dock. The Haiheng ship's escort team discovered him and reported to the captain. They immediately captured the con artist at the dock, temporarily placed him in the fifth-class cabin, and assigned several security police to guard him. The scammed crew members Zheng, Su, Li, etc. questioned him about impersonating them and defrauding them. Yu lowered his head and said nothing, admitting that he had done this out of economic pressure. Because it was Sunday and the China Merchants Bureau was closed, he was guarded in the ship overnight. During this time, he was ordered to hand over all the items used to cheat people out of money. Yu then went to the Tonghe Public Inn in the French Concession and took out all the items.</p>
<p>Evidence Seized: The most important items handed over by the con artist included: (1) A passport for Yu Jian, Section Chief of the First Section of the Ordnance Department of the Ministry of Military Affairs; (2) A certificate of scholarship for students in the United States; (3) A document from the Military Affairs Commission of the National Government; (4) An order from the Executive Yuan; (4) An order for the Education Section Education Fund (salary of 600 yuan); (5) An order from the three ministries of military affairs, industry, and foreign affairs of the National Government (to collect 25,000 yuan in tuition fees in Guangdong); (6) The insignia of Qu Yong, Professor of Civil Engineering of the Ordnance Department of the Army Ministry; (7) The insignia of Yu Jian, Section Chief of the Ministry of Military Affairs; (8) A sign for Chen Jiaduo, Commander of the Fujian Provincial Garrison; (9) A sign for Qu Peiduo, Secretary of the Fourth Army Group; (10) A sign for Qu Peicheng, Professor of Engineering of the Training Corps of the First Army Group; (11) Four blank three-star insignias; (12) Qu Yong's passport for going abroad; (13) A magnetic badge of Chiang Kai-shek; (13) A pair of colonel's collar badges; (14) A seal of the Ministry of Military Affairs (wood carving), a seal of Minister He; (15) A small wooden seal of Chiang Kai-shek, Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission of the National Government; (16) A seal of He Jian, and five other wooden seals of various types; (10) (7) A star insignia of the U.S. Consul; (18) A box of lead type; a bundle of other miscellaneous documents; and a fake diamond ring, and three pawn tickets.</p>

<p>Tong Kang Sheng Cloth Shop on Elkin Road is opened by Wang Wenda from Nanhui and has been around for many years. Shi Zhilian is the manager. Shi resides at the home of his relative Ding Anji at No. 3, Tong Fa Lane, East of the store. Recently, Shi suddenly became ambitious, employing his own people and ordering his nephews, Shi Qinsheng and Zhu Shuitian, to secretly bundle up silk fabrics from the store when the store employees were asleep at night. When the morning light appeared, they would load them onto a rickshaw and transport them to their residence in Tong Fa Lane. This theft had been going on for more than one day. It was not until 2:30 yesterday morning that Shi and Zhu were carrying out their old tricks when they were discovered by the store owner Wang Wenda. He urgently reported to the local Huisi Police Station, and detectives Wang Hongsheng and Xie Zhiguang rushed to the scene and arrested Shi and Zhu. They then went to Tong Fa Lane to investigate Shi Zhilian, but he had already fled upon hearing the news and was not caught. Shi Qinsheng and Zhu Shuitian were escorted to the First Special District Local Court, where Judge Liu Yugui interrogated them. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin stated the case, stating that the defendants had been stealing goods in succession, and the value had reached 4,000 yuan. He requested that they be punished according to the law. Wang Wenda also reported the discovery process. When questioned, Shi and Zhu stated that they were ordered by Shi Zhilian to transport the goods to Tong Fa Lane.

<p>The China National Products Manufacturers Association responded to the invitation of the Anhui Provincial Government to collect domestic products to participate in the Mobile Exhibition of Goods along the Wutun Road. The registration has already ended since it began. Yesterday, the association received a letter from the Construction Department of Anhui Province, stating: "To whom it may concern, we have received your letter No. Zhongzi 26 and understand everything. Since Mr. Zhou Zhaolin has gone to Shao for official business, please send another representative to Wuhu to work together to prepare, to facilitate the process. The opening date of the association will not be postponed. All products from Shanghai manufacturers should be shipped from today onwards, and we hope that you will continue to encourage participation as much as possible. Enclosed are five tax-exempt certificates and five reduced-fee shipping orders (15 in total), please check and use them. We hope to receive a reply." It is heard that the association has informed participating manufacturers to load goods tomorrow to participate in the exhibition as scheduled.</p>
<p>Confession: In the ship, Yu Jian wrote a confession, stating: "Yu Jian, real name Hengqiu, 23 years old, from Xiangyin, Hunan, graduated from Dalou Middle School, father is 60 years old, mother is 50 years old, grandmother is 80 years old. Came to Beijing in February 1934 to seek employment. A friend introduced him to be a secretary in the 16th Army. He was unable to cope in less than two months due to contracting gonorrhea. He drifted to Nanjing, unable to find a job. Last August, he went to his cousin's place at the Sanchu Chaiji Restaurant in Dananmen, Xinhui, Guangdong, but was unsuccessful. He returned to Beijing after a month and had no way out. He had no food to eat and no clothes to wear. Therefore, he borrowed 200 yuan from the secretary of the escort team, which he has not yet repaid. He returned to Beijing and stayed at the Zhengda Hotel in Dapingqiao, owing a lot of money and unable to return to Beijing. Therefore, this January, he went to Guangdong again on the Haiheng, intending to get travel money to return to Beijing. When he arrived in Guangdong, he had no money because his cousin's store had moved from the fourth shop to the public welfare store, so he could not go. He returned to Shanghai on the Haiheng, again without a penny. He deliberately intended to get money to return to Beijing. He originally wanted to become sworn brothers with Zheng, and took a photo together, and borrowed 89 yuan from him. He also swindled 10 yuan from Li, and forged the seals of Minister He, Mr. Zheng, the Chinese Consulate in the United States, and Qu Xiangheng and Qu Litao, as well as an official document from the Ministry of Military Affairs. He came to Shanghai from Beijing yesterday and was discovered by the crew of the Haiheng. I hope you will have compassion and mercy, and forgive the ignorance of youth. From now on, I will correct my mistakes and make a new start. My actions this time were really to get money to live on, and there was no other purpose. I now regret it and am willing to return home, and I will never again borrow the name of others to swindle outside. If I do so again, I am willing to be punished by law, etc." (Omitted below)</p>
<p>Sent to the Water Police: The crew members of the Haiheng had previously telegraphed Beijing to inquire about whether there was such a person as Yu Jian in the Ministry of Military Affairs. They received a reply that there was indeed such a person as Yu Jian in the Ordnance Department, but he was over 50 years old and had not left Beijing. It was obvious that he was an impostor. Yesterday, the Haiheng affairs director reported to the General Bureau as usual, and the bureau sent Shi Weijun to the ship. At the same time, the Jianghai Customs Water Police Station was notified. At 1:30 PM, the Water Police Station sent criminal department leader Huang Zhenlin to the Haiheng ship to take away the con artist Yu Jian and the private forged official documents and seals.</p>

<p>Leaders of the Shaoxing Seven Counties Sojourners Association in Shanghai, including Wang Xiaolai, Wang Yansong, Fei Yunqing, and others, believe that the scenery of Yue (Shaoxing), is the most beautiful in the southeast, with countless scenic spots and historical sites. In recent years, since the Xiao-Shao-Xin-Zhu Highway has connected Hangzhou, Ningbo, Wenzhou, and Taizhou, transportation has become even more convenient, and tourist expeditions have come one after another. At this time, when the Yu Mausoleum has been newly renovated and the weather is fine and sunny, it is the perfect time to explore and wash away worldly concerns. Therefore, they have jointly initiated and organized the Shaoxing Spring Tour Group, inviting leaders from all walks of life in Shanghai and Hangzhou to visit Yue.

<h3 id="e173">Zhu Jianqiu's Tragic Death Case Adjourned: Yesterday, Witnesses Described What They Knew of the Incident; The Official Adjourned the Trial, and the Verdict is Scheduled to Be Announced on the 30th Afternoon <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>The household registration section of the Zhenru Police Station, while investigating household registrations, caused Zhu Jianqiu, the owner of a family food store, to suffer torture at the hands of the police, with a large amount of water poured into his nose, resulting in suffocation and death. After forensic examination by the Research Institute, the prosecutor of the District Court, Lei Binzhang, repeatedly summoned witnesses and concluded the investigation. The chief of the police station, Zhou Pingyuan, officers Xing Guonong, chief Zhang Zhizhong, police officers Liu Mingqi, Ma Xiantu, and others were prosecuted for the crime of causing death by injury and brought to the criminal court, where Judge Shao Qinzhi conducted two public trials. Zhou Pingyuan and Xing Guonong tried to shirk responsibility, and their statements contradicted each other. By order, Zhou and Xing were separately detained, while Zhang Zhizhong and others were released on bail. The examining judge, for the sake of caution, repeatedly summoned witnesses for further questioning, as reported in previous issues. It is now learned that Zhou Pingyuan was previously released on bail by the Public Security Bureau. Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, Judge Shao held another court session to continue the trial. On the plaintiff's side, the deceased's younger brother, Zhu Shiying, and his private prosecution lawyer, Yan Hongxi, appeared in court. The defendants were represented by three lawyers, Lin Dawen, Feng Meixue, and Huang Shaochang. The Public Security Bureau sent police to escort Zhou Pingyuan to court. After the judge took his seat, he ordered the incarcerated Xing Guonong to be brought before the court. After a brief interrogation, the judge ordered the witness Yang Maorong to be brought before the court. According to Yang's testimony, he is 56 years old, from Changsha, Hunan, an employee of the Shanghai Public Security Bureau, residing in Lujiabang, and related to Zhu Jianqiu as an uncle. The judge asked about what he said during the investigation, saying that although there was no signed statement at the time, there was a written record, and that today, before speaking in court, he must first sign a statement before speaking again. He was then asked to describe in detail the facts he knew. Yang replied that on the 25th, his nephew Zhu Shiying called to tell him that because of a mistake in the household registration, his apprentice had been detained by the police station and asked for help. At that time, he told his nephew that such minor matters would only result in a small fine. The next day (the 26th), Shiying called again, saying that the police station had sent six police officers to arrest his brother Jianqiu for a minor violation, which was truly muddled. After receiving the call, he replied that if it was so muddled, he would not interfere. On the morning of the 27th, Shiying personally came to his place and said that his brother Jianqiu had been fatally injured by torture in the police station. Hearing this, he immediately instructed Shiying to hire a lawyer to file a lawsuit in court and handle the matter according to law. The judge asked if he had asked Li Yunsheng of Lane Li Yunsheng to help his nephew resolve the household registration issue. Yang replied that he did, because after receiving the call from his nephew, he did not know anyone at the Zhenru Police Station, so he asked Li Yunsheng to help his nephew with the violation and instructed him to handle it according to the regulations. Next, the witness Li Yunsheng testified that he is 37 years old, from Nanchang, Jiangxi, and works in the Inspectorate of the Municipal Public Security Bureau. The judge asked if he had made a preliminary report regarding the case, and that was why he had been summoned to court today. He was asked to state the facts as he knew them and that he must first sign a statement before speaking. The judge asked if he knew anyone at the Zhenru Police Station. Li replied that he only knew Inspector Lin. The judge asked him to state the facts he knew. Li replied that on the 25th, Yang Maorong asked him to help his nephew, who was detained at the Zhenru Police Station for a discrepancy in household registration. He asked him to go there and handle it according to the regulations. Upon receiving Yang Maorong's request, he informed Inspector Lin of the situation by phone. Lin replied that he would wait for the chief of the police station to return before making a decision. The judge asked if Inspector Lin had come to his place because Zhu Jianqiu's mother had made a scene at the police station and asked him to convey to Yang Maorong to persuade Zhu's mother to return home. Li replied that this was not the case. The judge then said to Yang Maorong, "What exactly do you mean by the word 'muddled' in your phone call?" Yang replied that on the 25th, his nephew called to ask for help, and on the 26th, he said that the police station was handling things in a muddled way, but his nephew was not mentally confused. As for Zhu Jianqiu's minor violation of household registration regulations, the Zhenru Police Station actually sent six police officers to arrest him. If there were ten or a hundred households with errors, would the entire police force have to go? However, his nephew's death was a small matter, but for the sake of the citizens in the future, he had to expose the inside story to serve as a warning for the future. Next, the witness Hong Xingchi testified that he is 23 years old, from Anhui, and a student at Southeast Medical College. At 6:00 PM on the 25th, five of them were eating dinner at Zhu Jianqiu's store. He saw that Zhu was full of energy and was cooking for them. After they finished eating, they chatted and dispersed. The next day at noon, they went back for lunch. According to the apprentice in the store, the store owner had gone to the police station for household registration matters, so no one was cooking. Since they had no food to eat, the five of them went to visit. On the way, they saw Zhu Jianqiu lying on a rickshaw, his face pale, his eyes frequently rolling upwards, and his throat swollen. Seeing this situation, they were deeply shocked. They asked why he was in this state, but Zhu could not speak. When they took off his clothes, they saw injuries on his back. They asked Zhu Jianqiu if he had been beaten at the police station, and Zhu nodded frequently. So they accompanied Zhu Jianqiu in the rickshaw back to the police station to question them. The police station denied beating him and said that there was a discrepancy in household registration and a fine of one yuan should be paid. So they paid one yuan on behalf of Zhu, and the police station issued a receipt. Seeing that Zhu Jianqiu's complexion was abnormal, they quickly ordered the rickshaw driver to take him to Southeast Hospital for treatment. The testimonies of Zhan Jihan, Hu Weisan, Yu Zheshen, and others were largely consistent with that of Hong Xingchi. Zhu Shiying testified that he called his uncle on the 25th to ask for help, and on the 26th, he called to tell him that the Zhenru Police Station was handling things in a muddled way. On the 27th, he went to his uncle's house to tell him the tragic death of his brother Jianqiu. At this point, the judge invited Prosecutor Lei Binzhang to court to present his case, stating that the facts of the case were extremely clear and that he should request a public judgment according to law. The defendants' lawyers, Lin Dawen and others, then rose to defend the defendants, stating that "There are strange things under the heavens. Just like the recent case of Ruan Lingyu's suicide by taking sleeping pills, the facts of why she committed suicide are being investigated. In this case, it cannot be proven who the perpetrator was. Moreover, the deceased went to another place after leaving the police station before going to the hospital. The court should carefully examine this. The prosecutor's indictment is based entirely on speculation. They request that a verdict of not guilty be announced." Finally, private prosecution lawyer Yan Hongxi stated that "Police torture in police stations is a public secret. However, the chief and officers would not directly pour water. If police officers inflict torture, they must have received orders from the chief and officers. Now, I request that the private prosecution investigate. The victim Zhu Jianqiu was 39 years old. Counting to 60 years old, there are still 21 years. Calculating at 100 yuan per month, I request 25,200 yuan. The cost of clothing and coffin is 303 yuan, totaling 25,503 yuan, for which all defendants are jointly liable." The judge then asked Zhou Pingyuan and others if they had any final statements and how they would respond to the private prosecution. Zhou and the others replied that they did not commit the assault and did not want to pay compensation. Zhou Pingyuan also stated that Zhu Jianqiu was in the police station for four hours and that he never saw him. As for the statement that "two people helped him out of the police station," he only heard it from others. The judge, having heard the testimony, considered the trial concluded and scheduled the verdict to be announced at 2:00 PM on the 30th of this month. Xing Guonong was returned to custody, and Zhou Pingyuan was taken back by police from the Public Security Bureau. Attorney Yan rose and requested that the court detain Zhou, as Zhou had already been dismissed from his post and there was a risk of escape. The judge said that Zhou Pingyuan was released on bail by the Public Security Bureau and that there should be no other concerns. He then adjourned the court. By that time, all the houses were lit up.</p>

<p>Corresponding to the interbank lending market is the securities market. When productive enterprises prosper and interbank lending rates are high, the stock market declines. When productive enterprises decline, investors shift their attention to bonds, causing bond prices to rise. According to Table 3, the Shanghai bond index shows that bond prices from January to June were 19% higher. In July, they reached a peak of 111.9, 31.93% higher than the average at the beginning of the year. Although they gradually fell after August, the year-end figure of 98.9 was still more than 18% higher than at the beginning of the year. The annual average was 96.73, 24.76% higher than in the 20th year of the Republic. In terms of transaction volume, this year was over 400 million yuan, an increase of over 78.4 million yuan or 19.6% compared to the 22nd year of the Republic. The decline in industry and commerce can be seen from this. The amount of bill exchange and public bill collection also indicates the volume of market transactions. The first four months of this year were quite sluggish, with a daily average of just over 40 million yuan. From May onwards, it gradually increased, and by December, the daily average was over 60 million yuan. However, this is still one-third lower than the daily average of 89.312 thousand yuan for public bill collection in the same period of the 20th year of the Republic. The annual daily average was 53 million yuan, which is also inferior to the annual daily average of 75 million yuan in the 20th year of the Republic. However, it is an increase of 7.6 million yuan compared to the annual average of the 22nd year of the Republic. In terms of clearing institutions, the bill exchange office accounted for an annual average of 20.1%, approximately twice the annual average of 11.6% in the 22nd year of the Republic. Money shop public bills accounted for 79.9% this year (see Table 3 for monthly details of the daily average amount). (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e182">Davis Cup Representatives Xu and Zheng Leave Shanghai for the US This Morning: Hoover President Liner Departs at Ten O'Clock; Farewell Performance at Shen Garden Last Night <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>Xu Chengji and Zheng Zhaojia, representatives to this year's Davis Cup tennis tournament, are scheduled to leave Shanghai for the United States on the 大來 Hoover President Liner at 10:00 this morning. The Progress Association held a performance competition in the Shen Garden basketball room last night. Mrs. Dimitriev, a famous American female player, also appeared in the performance. The results are as follows:</p>
<p>(Singles) Qiu Feihai</p>
<p>Six to one Six to zero Xu Chengji</p>
<p>(Singles) Lin Baohua Six to three Seven to five Mrs. Dee</p>
<p>(Doubles) Xu Chengji Zheng Zhaojia thirteen to thirteen Qiu Feihai Carlsson</p>
<p>Xu Chengji Unaccustomed to Lights At half past eight, Xu Chengji and Qiu Feihai took the stage, but the venue was a bit narrow, lacking room to move around. In addition, Xu Chengji was unaccustomed to the indoor eye lights and was at a loss. Even fast balls were difficult to catch. Although there were one or two good shots, they did not help the actual situation, so he had no intention of fighting and gave up with a score of six to one, six to zero, only getting one game in the sixth game.</p>
<p>Mrs. Dee Greatly Appreciated Next, Mrs. Dee performed against Lin Baohua. Dee was the US women's singles champion in 1930 and indeed had amazing shots. Both left and right draws, slices, and chops were excellent. Her volley in front of the net won many applause. The ball landed quickly and accurately, which was wonderful. It can be seen that she is highly skilled. Ordinary male players may all be embarrassed. In the first set, Lin took a lead with three to one and was chased to four to three. Lin won with six to three. In the second set, Lin also took a lead with three to zero, then three to three, four to four, five to five. The situation was extremely tense. Lin did not relax at all and won with seven to five.</p>
<p>Doubles Ends in a Tie without a Winner Finally, the doubles took the stage. Davis Cup representatives Xu and Zheng faced Qiu and Ka. Qiu and Ka served first. Both sides were evenly matched, and the servers won each time, unable to distinguish between the two. At thirteen each, it was still a tie. Because it was late, a ceasefire was declared. Zheng Zhaojia's performance last night showed significant progress, while Xu was average, probably due to unfamiliarity with the venue. The cooperation between the two has not yet been seen as good, probably due to the little time they have together. The Japanese Cup players Yamanishi and Nishimura also visited the scene last night. Shen Siliang gave a speech to introduce them.</p>

<h3 id="e184">A Memorable Scene from the Coal Mine Basketball Game: Jinan Defeats Fudan and Seizes the Championship, Resulting in 51 to 40; Central Wins Against Chih Chih in Another Match <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>The Jiangnan University Basketball Championship has been underway since its commencement, with more than half of the games completed. Yesterday, there were two matches: Jinan versus Fudan, and Central versus Chih Chih, held at Jiangwan and Shuidian Road, respectively. Jinan and Fudan are known for their strong teams. Since the beginning of the competition, neither team has suffered a defeat, truly making them two giants in this year's league. Therefore, yesterday's match was nothing short of a championship final. As a result, Jinan, relying on the bravery of its five key players, defeated Fudan with a score of 51 to 40. The Jiangnan University Championship will inevitably move from Jiangwan to Zhenru. (Last year's champion was Fudan.) With Jinan defeating Fudan, all other matches should be easily won. In another match, Central narrowly defeated Chih Chih with a score of 24 to 21.</p>
<p>Jinan Crushes Fudan</p>
<p>The Gymnasium is Packed</p>
<p>The match between Jinan and Fudan took place at 3:30 PM yesterday afternoon in Fudan's Jiangwan Gymnasium. Since the outcome of this match was related to winning the championship, students from both Jinan and Fudan, deeply devoted to their schools, were willing to sacrifice their studies to watch the game. It was as if they were thinking, "Classes can be skipped, but this match is a must-see." Therefore, around 3 o'clock, the gymnasium was already packed like sardines. The entrances and exits were also blocked by the audience, cutting off traffic. Those who arrived later had to stand outside the door, quietly listening to the shouts from within.</p>
<p>Jinan Crushes from the Start</p>
<p>When the two teams met, Gui Ren added the finishing touch, and the scoreboard displayed eight points. Fudan relied on Fu Xiangrui to score a point from a free throw. Jinan's Xu Heng was not one to be outdone, adding two points, making it 12 to 1. Fudan's Weng Zhou and Fu combined their throws and free throws, rapidly increasing the score by 14 points, making it 16 to 15, trailing by one point. Before long, Fudan's Weng Renan scored a point from a free throw, tying the score at 16 to 16. As they faced off, Jinan's players scored 14 points in one breath, making it 30 to 16, leading again. Fudan's Zhou Dayun scored two baskets from the middle, making the score 30 to 20. The first half ended there.</p>
<p>Fudan's Counterattack Ultimately Suffers Defeat</p>
<p>As the second half began, Fudan's players remained extremely calm in this unfavorable environment, constantly thinking of ways to win unexpectedly. However, their opponent's defense was impenetrable, leaving them helpless. Jinan fought with increasing courage. The two players, Yin and Xu, made every shot. Fudan desperately chased after them, but the losses outweighed the gains. At this moment, the score became 39 to 27. About fifteen minutes in, Jinan's Xu Heng committed his fourth foul and was ejected from the game. Although Fudan also seized the opportunity to counterattack, Jinan's luck with the ball was prosperous, and every shot they took hit the mark. As a result, Jinan won with a score of 51 to 40.</p>

<p>Central Defeats Chih Chih</p>
<p>Central versus Chih Chih clashed at Chih Chih, and the two sides were evenly matched. In the first half, Central was very strong, and the coordination was also very skilled, leading by 18 to 10. Starting in the second half, Chih Chih counterattacked with great strength, and the score increased steadily. However, time waited for no one, and there was no way to reverse the situation. In the end, they were defeated with a score of 24 to 21.</p>

<p>Jinan Securely Wins the Championship</p>
<p>Only six schools joined the Jiangnan University Basketball League this season. Fudan has completed its schedule with a record of four wins and one loss. Guanghua's matches have also concluded. Jinan, after defeating Fudan yesterday, achieved a record of three wins and zero losses. There are still two matches remaining: (1) against Central tomorrow, (2) against Jinling on the 30th, both held at Jinan. Neither visiting team is a match for Jinan, so the championship is formally owned by Jinan. With the team's wonderful and miraculous performance this year, it truly deserves to be the championship team. The results of each school are as follows:</p>
<p>School Name Matches Played Wins Losses Percentage</p>
<p>Jinan University 3 3 0 1000</p>
<p>Fudan University 5 5 1 800</p>

<h3 id="e185">Performance Record of Japanese Davis Cup Players Yamagishi and Others; Lin Baohua and Carlson are No Match <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>Yamagishi and Nishimura, the Japanese Davis Cup tennis representatives, passed through Shanghai yesterday on their way to Europe. The China Tennis Association specially invited them to perform at its venue on Singapore Road. Yamagishi and the others passed through Shanghai last year on their return from Europe and performed at the Shanghai Tennis Club. The Chinese people had already appreciated their skills. Yamagishi's skills are very refined, while Nishimura is merely mediocre, comparable to our country's players Zheng Zhaojia and Xu Chengji. The audience reached four to five hundred people, making it quite lively. Here is a brief description of the match situation: Starting at 12:15, Yamagishi played singles against Carlson, last year's Shanghai champion. Yamagishi was bold and fierce, and his flat, rapid, and deep baseline shots made Carlson exhausted. Carlson managed to win one game in the first set, but could not win even one game in the second set, allowing Yamagishi to control the entire match. The two sets took only half an hour.</p>
<p>The second match was a doubles match between Lin Baohua and Peng Nawei against Yamagishi and Nishimura, which was a very beautiful performance. The Japanese players' net play and overhead smashes were extremely powerful, leaving Lin and Peng unable to cope. Lin and Peng played very hard, but were absolutely unable to break through the opponent's formation. In the end, Lin and Peng only won one game in two sets. The third and fourth matches were singles matches, first Lin Baohua against Nishimura. The situation seemed quite balanced, but Lin could not maintain consistency and frequently sent the ball into the net. Nishimura was steady and experienced, with very few unforced errors. Lin lost 1-6. The final match was a self-match between Yamagishi and Nishimura, neither of whom used their full power to attack. Nishimura's encounter with Yamagishi was like Lin Baohua's encounter with Nishimura, only winning one game. There is always someone stronger, which shows the mystery of art. The results of each group are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Yamagishi defeated Carlson 6-1, 6-0 (2) Yamagishi and Nishimura defeated Lin Baohua and Peng Nawei 6-1, 6-0 (3) Nishimura defeated Lin Baohua 6-1 (4) Yamagishi defeated Nishimura 6-1</p>

<p>Mr. Tong Zhongyi, a famous martial arts master, excels in combat techniques and injury treatment, and has particularly extensive experience in wrestling. Recently, he compiled his decades of teaching experience into a book titled "Chinese Wrestling Method." It covers the basic exercises of wrestling, the implementation of techniques, and uses illustrations to explain in detail. The book is finely printed on beige coated paper, with over three hundred copperplate illustrations. Even those who have not learned martial arts can follow the illustrations and teach themselves without a teacher. Those who wrote prefaces for the book include Zhang Zhijiang, Director of the Central Martial Arts Academy; Xiang Zongding, Director of the Qingdao Martial Arts Academy; and Liu Pixian of the Henan Martial Arts Academy. Military and political leaders such as Liu Xiang, Chairman of Sichuan Province, and Chu Minyi of the Executive Yuan, as well as Mayor Wu Pan Gongzhan of this city, all wrote inscriptions and prefaces, considering it a rare find among martial arts books. At a time when the New Life Movement is being vigorously promoted, physical training is particularly urgent. Moreover, wrestling is not only a unique and clever technique for self-defense, but also has a significant effect on cultivating the spirit of perseverance and struggle, and is also an extremely interesting sport. The book is published by the Chinese Wrestling Society and is available for sale at the National Martial Arts Hall at Xin Kaihe City, Minquan Road, at the Dafang Art Company on the 4th floor of 692 Niuzhuang Road, Zhejiang Road, and at Qixin Bookstore and Xiaojingshanfang in this city, as well as at martial arts schools in various provinces and cities in other areas.</p>
<h3 id="e190">Triangular Track and Field Competition: China Wins the Final Victory; Tens of Thousands of People Gather in Yangyao Bay; The Sound of Golden Drums and Tense Situation <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>The Chinese Athletic Association track and field team competed in a triangular competition with Suzhou Weiming and Wuxi Liangxi in Wuxi, which has been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday, the 24th, was the start date of the competition. However, the Suzhou Weiming team was temporarily unable to participate, but many of the team members refused to give up temporarily. Therefore, they all gathered spontaneously and arrived at the venue at 10:00 AM to participate. However, the team was renamed "Perseverance." At noon, Mr. Xue Huidong invited the team members to a luncheon. The meeting was scheduled to begin at 1:00 PM. Wu Bangwei, Director of the Jiangsu Provincial Sports Association, also attended the event and served as vice president. Then, Mr. Xue and Mr. Wu, together with all the staff, led the team members around the venue for a week. After the photography was completed, the competition began. At that time, the weather was clear and peaceful, which made the athletes even more energetic. The excellent results this time were unexpected. For example, Ye Lifa of China in the 100 meters, Yao Zaining in the 400 meters, Zhao Xiao in the 1500 meters, Yang Dilin and Luo Qian in the discus, Wu Weishui in the javelin, and Wu Hanzhang of Liangxi in the 3000 meters, and Zhang Jiakui in the triple jump, were all excellent records and added a lot of color. The China and Liangxi teams were evenly matched. Before the javelin event, each team had scored 69 points. The atmosphere at the venue was extremely tense. After the javelin competition started, each member of the Chinese team threw the javelin beyond 40 meters, and they uniquely earned eleven points in a uniform manner. The score increased from 69 to 80, and they took the lead. Liangxi scored 69 points and won the second place. Perseverance scored 15 points and ranked last. By the time the meeting adjourned, the lights were already on in thousands of homes. The results of each event are recorded as follows:</p>

<p>In order to create a national atmosphere of learning and improve cultural standards, the Chinese Cultural Construction Association has specially organized a National Reading Competition, with registration offices in the provincial and municipal branches of the Cultural Construction Association. Registration began on April 25th. The first reading period is from April 1st to the end of September. Those with excellent results will be awarded a bonus of 3,000 yuan to encourage them. The declaration and registration methods are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Declaration: "Living in this era of severe national crisis, in terms of the nation-state, we must strengthen our national strength, which goes without saying. However, the formation of a country is based on the growth of its people, so to strengthen national strength, we must first strengthen the abilities of our people. Moreover, in this era of fierce international competition, what determines victory or defeat is the actual strength of politics, economy, and military, but the foundation lies entirely in the intelligence of the people. Because what is called politics and economy is nothing more than a total manifestation of the people's intelligence, therefore, only a people with high intelligence can ensure their existence and not be wiped out by others. In the past, China, although repeatedly conquered by foreign races, was able to maintain its independent status and cause the militarily victorious race to be assimilated by us. The reason for this is that our country's people are more intelligent than the foreign races. However, now the times have changed, and our intelligence, undeniably, is far inferior to that of European, American, and Japanese countries. Therefore, not only is our science backward, but also our political and economic strength is far inferior to theirs. Therefore, at this time, the strengthening of national intelligence is essential, and the only way to strengthen national intelligence is for the whole country to devote themselves to hard work and engage in reading and research. This is the primary significance of the Chinese Cultural Construction Association launching the Reading Competition on its anniversary.</p>
<p>Moreover, in terms of individuals, such as the preparation of life skills and the understanding of social customs, all depend on reading. As the saying goes, reading clarifies principles. And at this time of economic difficulty and difficult livelihoods, reading to seek knowledge seems even more necessary. However, the reality is exactly the opposite. What permeates society is an atmosphere of not reading. Depravity, languor, idleness, and debauchery have become fashionable. Not only do young students make it a common practice to make trouble, but also the literary world values humor and light essays. Because of this, the air of falsehood infects people, creating a frivolous and clamorous atmosphere. To reform this habit, we naturally have to start from the practical aspects, so that everyone knows the importance of learning. This transformation from a style of enjoyment and decadence to a style of hard work and refinement is the secondary significance of the Chinese Cultural Construction Association launching the Reading Competition.</p>
<p>Third, the biggest shortcoming of today's school system is that it uses money as a ladder to higher education. Poor children, even if they have talent, often suffer from a lack of opportunities to enter school. Secondly, all the lessons are often unnecessarily prolonged. There are often courses that can be completed in a few months, but must be studied for a year. This is a painful experience for young people with superior talent who cannot develop. The intention of launching the Reading Competition is to correct this shortcoming. First, to provide assistance for poor children to rise, and second, to provide opportunities for young people who are eager to learn to study and improve themselves. Therefore, on the one hand, we are negotiating with publishing bookstores to sell textbooks and books at the lowest possible price, and on the other hand, we are offering bonuses as encouragement.</p>
<p>In short, the purpose of the Reading Competition is nothing more than what is stated in the outline: to encourage reading, cultivate a good atmosphere of learning, and improve cultural standards. But this is the basic work of building Chinese culture and revitalizing the Chinese nation. We hope that all seniors and talents at home and abroad will not hesitate to help. Much obliged."</p>

<p>(Dispatch from Xuancheng) The Anhui Provincial Department of Education, in order to actively promote local education and to integrate normal school education with local education, has implemented a local education guidance system. The province is divided into six guidance districts, with each district using a provincial normal school as the guidance center. A district guidance committee is organized, with the principal of the normal school appointed by the Department of Education as the chairman. Each district also has a local education supervisor who is supervised and guided by the chairman and is responsible for guidance work. The Provincial Xuancheng Normal School is the central organ of the Fourth Guidance District, which encompasses eleven counties: Wuhu, Xuancheng, He County, Nanling, Fanchang, Hanshan, Jing County, Guangde, Langxi, Ningguo, and Dangtu. On the 15th of this month, Hu Jiajian, the principal of the Provincial Xuancheng Normal School and chairman of the district guidance committee, convened the first local education guidance conference at the Provincial Xuancheng Normal School. Those in attendance included educational administrative leaders, county supervisors, and representatives of educational service personnel from the eleven counties under its jurisdiction. Principal Hu Jiajian of Xuancheng Normal School presided over the meeting, which lasted three days and resolved twenty-three key proposals.

<p>— (Yan Ming)</p>
<p>People are good at talking about purpose. All their behaviors are to achieve a certain purpose. However, in the process of achieving their conscious "purpose," they never feel that there is a final purpose. The so-called final purpose is "death."</p>
<p>Seen from the perspective of this "death" purpose, all the "purposes" that people want to achieve can be said to be merely means to achieve the "death" "purpose"! A person wants to escape from suffering and enter the path of life, but they don't know that the path of life is just a segment in the path of death.</p>
<p>Except for slight differences in time, giving birth to a child is equivalent to the death of an adult (the reason why "old man" is not written here is that people often die in their youth or prime of life). As soon as a person is born, they don't need training, and everyone is a long-distance runner on the sports field, competing to win the "death" championship.</p>
<h3 id="e197">Tears <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>— Jiao Xin</p>
<p>Zeng Wenzhenggong's diary says: "Suppressing desires is as difficult as a man's tears." He meant that a man's tears are as difficult as suppressing desires. But Liu Xuande's marriage to Lady Sun was entirely due to tears; Zhuge Kongming also preserved his life by weeping like a spring at the memorial service for Zhou Lang in Chaisangkou; as for the relief of the siege of Wu by Chu in the Spring and Autumn period, it was entirely due to Shen Daifu weeping for seven days and seven nights against the Qin court wall, shedding many tears. So who says men won't shed tears?</p>
<p>Tears and snot are inseparable brothers, always together. In colloquial terms, it's said: "a handful of snot, a handful of tears"; in literary terms, it's said: "tears and snot mingled."</p>
<p>"The wax candle turns to ashes, and tears begin to dry," but in fact, the wax candle never shed tears? It was just that the author at the time was full of depression and used it as a metaphor; so later, the resentful women in spring boudoirs couldn't help but be emotionally affected by this uninspired wax candle, and added a lot of sorrow out of thin air.</p>
<p>In "Dream of the Red Chamber," it is said that Lin Daiyu's crying is to repay the debt of tears owed to Jia Baoyu. Then, are all the women in the world who cry well also repaying debts of tears? The word "debt" is originally a vulgar word, but adding the word "tear" makes it very fragrant and seductive.</p>
<p>Tears have a salty taste. According to physiologists, water accounts for 99% of tears, and salt and protein each account for slightly less than 0.5%. Its function is to moisten the eyeballs and wash away the dust in the eye sockets, not just to express joy, anger, sorrow, and happiness.</p>

<p>— Wu Yafei</p>
<p>When I arrived in Wuxi, I visited several friends that day, but in the evening I returned to the hotel alone, closed the door and flipped through two pages of "An Introduction to Chinese Studies"; however, I felt very restless and really had no mood to read any further. So I burst out of the hotel door and strolled towards every street. Aimlessly, I wandered around, my eyes darting everywhere, conscious of the night scene here.</p>
<p>I wandered onto this lonely street like a ghost; it was already past eleven o'clock, so most of the shops were closed, and the surroundings were quiet, so desolate that ghosts could almost be caught; this small city had sunk into that quiet rest, waiting for dawn to arrive.</p>
<p>"...The moon is curved and shines on the street...Thinking of my hometown is so miserable...How many people have no clothes or food...How many people have no home to return to..."</p>
<p>In a pitch-black alley, there was a gradually approaching erhu sound, along with a sorrowful song, sung by a woman. But the tone trembled very badly, as if it were a ghost crying, making my hair stand on end! Each sentence and sound she sang pierced my heart like a sharp knife. I really couldn't bear to listen to it, nor did I have the courage to listen any further! I suddenly stood in the dark, wanting to avoid them, but looking through a dim street lamp, I saw them walking towards me. The pale yellow light shone on their faces. A man in his forties was playing the erhu, and a woman in her thirties was humming with her mouth puckered. Their faces were as green as cabbage leaves, and their eyes were filled with melancholy. The man's eyelids drooped, without a trace of spirit, and the woman looked like she was suffering from insomnia.</p>
<p>At this time, I was like an explorer who had encountered a beast and fled back, or like a soldier returning from a defeated battle, hurriedly fleeing back to the hotel. I walked into the room and fell on the bed. I dared not recall the scene just now. I felt like a triumphant returner from an unimaginable world.</p>

<p>Chapter 11: Night Talks of a Sad Life, Life Is Originally a Dream, Scattered Footprints, Wind and Rain Too Deceiving</p>
<p>Huanhua smiled again and said, please come over, I still have a few words to say to you, I don't want you to help me with money. Jia Duocai heard him say this, thinking that if he didn't go to his room, maybe he would run over. Therefore, he answered in his mouth and walked over to this room again. At this time, Yang Huanhua was not the same as before. His face was covered with powder, and his hair was combed smoothly. Seeing people come in, he greeted them with a smile, pulling at his clothes, seeming a bit embarrassed. In the past, seeing Yang Huanhua would evoke a sense of disgust in Jia Duocai. Seeing his pitiful appearance under the lamp now, he didn't hate him so much. Instead, he comforted him and said: Just now, consider it a dream, don't take it to heart. What else do you want to say? Huanhua sat on the bed, looking at him suspiciously from a distance, and said with a flirty smile: Can Mr. Jia sit for a while longer? I have a longer story to tell you, but I definitely don't want you to help me with any money. He stated this again, followed by a charming smile. Jia Duocai couldn't bear to refuse again, so he nodded and smiled: Speak, anyway, I have nothing to do tonight, I'll listen to you. Huanhua pulled at her clothes again, coughed slightly twice, and then said: Let me tell you the stories of two women first. The first one is from Anhui. Jia Duocai laughed and said: How did you think of the story of Anhui people in Xiaoxitian in Xi'an? Huanhua said: Because she is also wandering in Xi'an like me. She is an eighteen-year-old girl, with snow-white skin, an oval face, and jet-black hair. She often comes to Xiaoxitian, Mr. Jia may have seen her. Jia Duocai said: Is she wearing a dark green silk skirt? Huanhua said: That's right, it's her. Don't look at her like that, running to the hotel every day, she is a well-read lady. Jia Duocai gave a sigh and said: Why does she like to run to Xiaoxitian, I think she seems to be doing business! (166)</p>
<h3 id="e201">The Imperial Incense Drifting Record <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>— Originally Written by Princess Deling of the Qing Dynasty, Translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>After listening to this very implicit remark of Yi, I couldn't help but sigh secretly, but I still couldn't help but think it was very cruel to throw the cocoons containing the silkworm chrysalises that were not yet dead into boiling water. I raised a question to the Empress Dowager again.</p>
<p>"Why not cut open one end of the cocoon first, take out the silkworm pupae, and then throw it into boiling water?"</p>
<p>"That's not possible"! The Empress Dowager seemed to find my question ridiculously funny, but she was not annoyed and still answered very patiently: "The cocoon must never be broken, if it is broken, it cannot be reeled. If it could be broken, why wouldn't we wait for the pupae inside to turn into moths, and after they drilled out, take them to reel silk? Because the silk on the cocoons is very neat and continuous, it won't work if it's broken; and to pick out a silk thread from a cocoon, you have to soak it in boiling water. So this method cannot be changed...</p>
<p>"Besides, even if those silkworm pupae are not scalded to death, taking them out first, after a few days they will just die anyway!" She frankly and pointedly broke my unconscious pity.</p>
<p>The Empress Dowager really regarded silkworms as a way to relieve fatigue. Although she set aside such a large part of the house in the Summer Palace specifically for silkworm breeding, and spent a lot of money on preparing supplies, purchasing mulberry leaves, and also raised so many girls who did nothing all year round to take care of silkworm breeding; this capital is really not small. But she never sold the cocoons she obtained, always using them to reel silk herself; and the reeled silk was absolutely not sold, and she didn't see any great use for it, just storing them in skeins, or to satisfy her own temporary pleasure, then teaching another group of silk-making girls to dye those skeins of silk with various bright colors, and then collect them. This is nothing more than spending a few more dollars. (277)</p>
<h3 id="e202">Quick Sketch of Cichangli Restaurant <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Muliang</p>
<p>At lunchtime, all the offices dismissed almost simultaneously. The restaurants on both sides of Cichangli straightened up those hot meals and hot dishes, waiting for the office workers to come and patronize; then, the eating life of the office workers began.</p>
<p>Diners wriggled and surged in, and Cichangli immediately became densely populated; latecomers had already been encroached upon by early birds!</p>
<p>These are all regular customers, most of them eat guest meals, and the price is uniformly two jiao in small silver coins per guest. Humph, don't think that customers who eat two-jiao guest meals are stingy, in fact, they eat like lions opening their mouths; think about it, for two jiao in small silver coins, you can choose a mixed dish at will (expensive ones are of course exceptions), like stir-fried meat slices, stir-fried eel shreds, small white hooves, etc., you can choose at will; if people with good appetites can also get some rice for free when it's not enough, I think there is probably no such bargain in small restaurants?</p>
<p>Many diners shouted for "small white hooves! Small white hooves..." The Puxi landlady said worriedly: "Oh dear! So many people want to eat small white hooves, I'm really going to lose money"!</p>
<p>One diner said to the waiter: "Today, stir-fry fish tofu with chili for me, make it so it tastes good, understand"? Then another one said: "Hey! Quickly make a salty meat tofu soup, the tofu should be cooked thoroughly, the salty meat should be lean, and there should be plenty of oil..."</p>
<p>In this noisy sound, Zhang San wants to eat fish, Li Si wants to eat meat, and the waiters in several restaurants are driven to the point where they have nowhere to go by the diners, so some diners eat and leave without paying, and swagger away. For this reason, the waiters are generally suffering in silence, with unspeakable grievances!</p>
<p>When lunchtime is over, the diners all wriggle out of Cichangli and walk to their respective offices.</p>

<h3 id="e203">Brothers <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>— Zhu Xun</p>
<p>Wang Jiren and Wang Zhongren, brothers, went to court over a property division issue. The lawyers on both sides issued statements refuting each other based on reason, and the news of the trial was published and republished in newspapers, becoming a recent hot topic.</p>
<p>I knew the brothers Jiren and Zhongren twenty years ago. At that time, Jiren's father was still a partner in a money shop and had not been promoted to manager or transferred to the banking industry, so the Wang family's financial situation was not as splendid as it is in recent years.</p>
<p>When I met Jiren and the others, we were together in Mr. Li's private school. At that time, Jiren was only eight years old; with his exquisite figure and handsome face, our classmates all loved him very much. Zhongren was even younger, only about six years old; with a round head and a face that was so rosy and glowing, he looked like an apple. His silly appearance often made me laugh unintentionally.</p>
<p>The authority of the teacher in the private school was indeed as lofty as that of the emperors in the autocratic era. When the teacher's eyes were wide open and the ruler struck the table loudly, even the number one naughty child would be frightened like a condemned prisoner, trembling in fear! We were no exception in Mr. Li's private school.</p>
<p>I remember one day, Mr. Li was probably angry because of his wife, and his face was so stern that it was scary; coincidentally, Zhongren's homework that day was not memorized well. When he was reciting, he recited the first sentence and forgot the next sentence, and couldn't get it out. Mr. Li threw the book down again and again, asking Zhongren to read it and then recite it, but when he went up the second and third times, he was still frightened and couldn't get it out stutteringly. Mr. Li got angry, picked up the ruler, and slammed it on the table. But this sound didn't scare Zhongren into reciting the book, but instead, he let out a cry and was scared into crying.</p>
<p>This cry made Mr. Li's anger even greater. He grabbed Zhongren, who was standing blankly beside him, and struck Zhongren's hand repeatedly with the ruler. However, because of the teacher's beating, Zhongren cried even louder; and the teacher's ruler struck even harder. In the end, the ruler was like raindrops, densely hitting Zhongren's body and head. The poor Zhongren was like a lamb wailing under the whip, waiting to die.</p>
<p>However, now this pair of loving brothers are in endless lawsuits over the property issue. Thinking of this past event, a layer of bewilderment suddenly floated into my heart.</p>

<h3 id="e204">Finance: Silver Prices in India Continuously Rise; Specie Lacks Support - Buyers Discouraged, Continuing to Fall by Five Yuan - <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the gold market saw rising London silver prices, followed by sluggishness and a slight rebound. Investor sentiment remained stable, but unexpectedly, Indian silver prices rose significantly, triggering speculation. Guangdong merchants also hoarded shillings, but ultimately, the market weakened again. In the morning, overseas silver markets saw British currency rise and the U.S. dollar remain flat. Montreux forward silver prices fluctuated. Customs gold units fell by 4.5 pence, and exchange rates saw only minor fluctuations. Investor sentiment was weak. In off-exchange pre-market trading, prices broke through the 70 yuan mark, then retreated to 67.78 yuan. Major players took advantage of the low prices to buy aggressively, causing a rebound. The Central Bank's official rates were announced, with British and U.S. currencies flat, and the Customs gold unit fell by 0.05 yuan. The standard price for specie retreated to 906.6 yuan. The morning market opened lower and briefly dipped further. However, due to concerted aggressive buying by major players taking advantage of the low prices, the market was maintained. Banks eagerly bought at cheap prices, and buyers were even more enthusiastic, gradually driving the price back up to over 70 yuan. It was anticipated that the HSBC's official rates would show both British and U.S. currencies flat, leading to further increases. Banks slightly reduced their selling, causing a temporary setback, but the market did not fall below the 70 yuan mark again. Banks continued to buy eagerly, and Chinese merchants joined in the buying, causing the foreign exchange market to suddenly tighten and prices to rebound again. Later, Sassoon bought nearly as much as they sold, and banks bought U.S. dollars and sold British pounds, leading to a fluctuating market. However, due to continued weak sentiment among retail investors, the market weakened slightly at noon but remained stable after closing. The after-market opened steadily. A Japanese bank in Korea reduced its shilling sales, and Indian silver prices rose by 12 annas, causing a renewed decline and a break below the 70 yuan mark. At this point, banks still maintained their support, and the market rebounded after the dip, but the market was stable and fluctuated for a long time. Later, when Indian silver prices rose again by 4 annas for the second time, selling pressure resurfaced. Guangdong merchants sold off shillings, and the foreign exchange market suddenly strengthened. Bullish speculators liquidated their positions, and major players also sold, causing another break below the 70 yuan mark. Supply exceeded demand, and the market was weakest at closing. The market was stable throughout the day, with the overall trend still fluctuating. Swap rates continued to increase to 3.5 yuan, mainly because the discount rate was almost the same as the borrowing rate, forcing those who held spot goods and shorted futures to liquidate. Bullish sentiment was difficult to boost. The day's market conditions are recorded below:</p>
<p>The morning opening was 870 yuan, down 2.2 yuan from last Saturday. Ding Kang, Heng Yu, and others sold, lowering the price to 68.5 yuan. Fu Xing, Yong Hui Xiang, and Yong Li took delivery, raising the price to 9.8 yuan. Yu Guang, Yong Yi Cheng, Heng Yu, Yi Da Da and others were still selling at 8.2 yuan. Jardine Matheson bought U.S. dollars for June delivery at 38 yuan. Wan Xing, Da De Cheng, Yu Ying Xiang, Hui Xiang, Yong Li, Shun Mao, and others successively bought, while Heng Yu and Fu Xing sold and then re-entered, raising the price to 71.8 yuan. Yong Li and Heng Yu sold at high prices, lowering the price to 0.07 yuan. Da De Cheng, Fu Yu, Wan Xing, Heng Yu, and Yong Li successively took delivery, raising the price again to 2.8 yuan. Jardine Matheson offered shillings for June delivery at 7 pence. Heng Yu, Yuan Chang, and retail investors sold their holdings, retreating the price to 0.01 yuan. Da De Cheng, Heng Yu, and Yong Li maintained their positions during the dip, and the price rose to 4.5 yuan. Fu Xing, Yong Da Da, Yong Li, Yi Feng, Yong Tong, and Tai Chang sold their holdings at high prices, lowering the price to 2.3 yuan. Chinese merchants bought shillings for June delivery at 7 pence. Da Da and Wan Xing took delivery, raising the price to 4.3 yuan. Sassoon also slightly increased its buying. Subsequently, Da De Cheng, Yi Feng, and Yong Ding Kang sold their holdings at high prices, dropping the price to 2.5 yuan. Jardine Matheson bought U.S. dollars for June delivery at 8.125 yuan, and British firms bought May delivery at 9.375 yuan. Wan Xing, Da Fa, and Yong Shang bought at 3.7 yuan. Investor sentiment was weak, and retail investors continued to exert pressure, but the market remained weak. Hui Xiang, Fu Yu, and Da Da also offered supplies, lowering the price to 1.1 yuan. Wan Xing, Qian Chang Xiang maintained their positions at low prices, raising the price to 2.3 yuan. Hui Xiang, Ding Kang, and Heng Yu were still selling. The noon closing was 871.4 yuan. After closing, Yuan Mao and Yong Lai entered, raising the price to over 2 yuan.</p>
<p>The afternoon opening was 873.2 yuan. Chang Da, Fu Xing, and Yong Jin bought at 2.7 yuan. Da De Cheng, Heng Yu, Yu Qing, Yong Hui Xiang, Yong Li, Hong Kang, and others sold their holdings. The first report of Indian silver prices rose by 12.11.13 annas, causing a drop to 69.8 yuan. Da Fa Yong, Wan Feng, Tong Tai Chang, Hong Xing, and Da De Cheng took delivery at low prices, raising the price to 71.9 yuan. The situation became fluctuating again. When Indian silver prices rose for a second time by 4.5.3 annas, Heng Yu and Ying Xiang sold, retreating the price to 70 yuan. Although there was a rebound, Sheng Da and Fu Yu continued to sell. Guangdong merchants also sold shillings, causing a drop to 67.8 yuan. Banks bought shillings for June delivery at 1.25 yuan. Wan Xing, Yuan Mao, and Yong Jin bought at 8.8 yuan. Heng Yu, Hui Xiang, Da De Cheng, Chang Da, Fu Sheng, Yong Yuan Chang, Yong Wan Feng, Da Chang Xiang, and retail investors all sold, causing the price to gradually retreat to 7 yuan. Yi Cheng and Heng Xing and Wan Xing struggled to maintain their positions during the dip. The closing price was 867.2 yuan. After closing, Yuan Mao, Yong Yuan, Yi Yuan, Chang Yong, Da Chang Xiang, Heng Yu, Fu Tai Yong, etc., successively sold their holdings, gradually lowering the price to 6.12 yuan. Da De Cheng entered and slightly stabilized the market. The highest price for the day was 874.5 yuan, and the lowest price was 867 yuan, a fluctuation of 7.5 yuan. As a result, the price fell another 5 yuan compared to last Saturday.</p>
<p>The settlement price, according to the Central Bank's official standard for specie, was lowered to 906.6 yuan. Based on the closing price, it was about 39 yuan lower, which was less than 3 yuan more than last Saturday. The price for April registration was 869 yuan, and the price for May was 871 yuan. The morning make-up price was 861 yuan, and the afternoon price was 857 yuan. Pure gold was priced at about 4 yuan higher, at 874 yuan. The spot market was weak, and swap rates were high. The additional cost for make-up continued to decrease. Tianjin goods were priced at 6.5 yuan higher, but no transactions were made. Bullish speculators in swap contracts continued to panic. As a result, Ying Feng Heng offered 35 contracts, and Jia Jian offered 21 contracts, all of which were bought by Yi Yu at 3.5 yuan. Later, Ding Tai offered 7 contracts to Yi Yu at 3 yuan, and Yi Feng Yong offered 14 contracts at the same price. Ying Feng Heng offered 7 contracts to Yi Feng Yong, also for 3 yuan. There were only 4,410 contracts remaining for April delivery, held by a total of 11 bullish parties and 29 bearish parties.</p>
<p>Trading within the exchange was normal. Overall, Wan Xing, Da Fa Yong, Da De Cheng, Fu Yu, Da Da, Da Cheng, Fu An, and Heng Xing were among the buyers, while Heng Yu, Da Chang Xiang, Yuan Mao Yong, Fu Xing Yong, Yuan Yi Yuan Chang Yong, Wan Feng, Zheng Chang, Hong Kang Yong, and Sheng Da were among the sellers. Hui Xiang, Yuan Mao Yong, Sheng Da, and Wan Feng entered and exited early, while Yi Cheng, Yi Feng Yong, and Fu Yu exited and entered early.

<p>According to yesterday's foreign dispatches, London large silver bar prices rose by 1.875, both near-term and forward. New York silver prices remained unchanged. Montreux forward silver prices fell by 0.01 and rose by 0.025. London pure gold fell by 4.5 pence. The British pound against the U.S. dollar fell by 0.025. The British pound against the French franc remained unchanged. The U.S. dollar against the British pound rose by 0.0125. The U.S. dollar against the French franc fell by 0.0375. The foreign exchange market opened with near-term selling prices. British currency was 1 shilling 7 and 1875 and 25 pence. U.S. currency was 38.1875 yuan, which was 0.0625 yuan weaker for the British currency and 0.0625 yuan stronger for the U.S. currency compared to last Saturday. The Central Bank's official rates were announced, with British and U.S. currencies flat, and the Customs gold unit fell by 0.05 yuan, with little impact. The market initially strengthened, but due to aggressive buying by banks taking advantage of low prices, it was able to maintain its position. The HSBC's official rates were announced, with British and U.S. currencies flat. Subsequently, the process suddenly tightened. Sassoon bought near-term and sold forward. Banks sold British pounds and bought U.S. dollars, and the situation fluctuated. Banks also actively traded with each other, with no special changes. However, the underlying potential was loosening at noon, with rumors that Tong Feng Heng was heavily buying U.S. dollars for April delivery. The afternoon market opened flat. Later, when Indian silver prices rose by 12.11.13 annas, the Japanese bank in Korea reduced its shilling sales, causing the market to strengthen. However, due to support from banks and Sassoon, there was still some struggle. When Indian silver prices rose again by 4.5.3 annas for the second time, investor sentiment became even weaker. Guangdong group Sheng Da also came to sell shillings, causing the process to become even stronger. By the close, near-term selling prices were: British currency at 1 shilling 7 and 25 pence, U.S. currency at 38.25 yuan, which was 0.09375 yuan weaker for the British currency and 0.125 yuan stronger for the U.S. currency compared to last Saturday. Chinese merchants had flat trading, mainly because although the Dalian group was selling, Tong Feng Heng and others were buying. Guangdong group Sheng Da sold forward shillings. The day's transactions are recorded below:</p>

<h3 id="e207">Securities: Government Bond Market Turbulent, This Month's Futures Suffer Squeeze - No. 96 Rushes to Deny Rumors - <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the last day of trading for March futures at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange was marked by a severe squeeze. Bearish traders were eager to swap their positions. Among them, only No. 96 stood out, with rumors circulating for days that it would not be reorganized and that it would no longer be traded on the market. These unfounded rumors were suddenly denied, and it was rumored that a major player with several million in short positions was deliberately spreading misinformation. The market was initially shaken and fell sharply, but eventually rebounded due to the implausibility of the rumors. This is a weakness that is easily exploited as delivery approaches. The day's events saw a somewhat chaotic opening in the morning, with prices generally rising before falling, and bulls and bears engaged in intense clashes. Gold shorts were squeezed the most, with this month's contract rising by 0.4 yuan, while others differed by only 0.2 yuan. No. 96 fell sharply by around 0.3 yuan. The second round of trading still saw more gains than losses, with the squeeze continuing. Contracts No. 14 and No. 43 saw the most trading, with more buying than selling. Contract No. 4 saw significant buying. The afternoon session continued the squeeze, and although No. 22 delivered a large number of this month's contracts, the squeeze was less severe. No. 96 also rebounded slightly. Today, only April futures will be traded, while May futures will not be available until the 29th, after delivery on the 28th. Yesterday's market results saw No. 96 down by around 0.34 yuan, with far-term liquidation down by 0.15 yuan, near-term contract down by 0.05 yuan, and all others up. The demobilization bond and the gold short this month rose by around 0.7 yuan the most. Other bonds rose by between 0.12 yuan and 0.34 yuan. The total trading volume was estimated at around 22.3 million yuan. The resulting price changes are listed in the table below: (unit: yuan)</p>

<p>The yarn market was trending flat, but since yesterday was the last day of trading for this month's contract, Yuda, a major bull, prepared to take delivery. The shorts were unable to deliver enough yarn and had to buy at market prices. As a result, market prices rose steadily, with the final price reaching 186 yuan. However, Yuda sold several hundred bales at market prices, resulting in a closing price of 183.9 yuan, up 9.4 yuan from the previous two-month closing price of 174.5 yuan. According to the market, delivery was estimated at a massive 7,000 bales.</p>
<p>Prices for futures contracts were also boosted. At the pre-market opening, prices for all months rose uniformly. This month's price continued to rise with each transaction because yesterday was the last day of trading. As a result, speculators who were short were unable to deliver enough yarn and had to painfully cover their positions. Distant-month contracts were also affected, rising in sympathy. As a result, the market appeared strong, with this month's contract rising 1.3 yuan over the previous day's closing price and the distant-month contracts rising 0.4, 0.5, 0.8, and 0.9 yuan. At the afternoon opening, the near-term market remained buoyant, completely influenced by this month's contract. Buying interest remained extremely strong as the market approached closing. However, Yuda sold some holdings for profit, slightly flattening the market. However, distant-month shorts continued to sell, weakening those contracts. As a result, this month's contract rose another 2 yuan over the morning closing price, and distant-month contracts fell 0.3, 0.4, 0.6, and 0.7 yuan. It was found that Dafu sold 1,350 bales, Yuda sold 1,150 bales, Jinchang sold 1,350 bales, Run Kang sold 1,500 bales, Mei Ji sold 500 bales, Tai Chang sold 600 bales, De Ji sold 550 bales, and Yong Chang sold 500 bales. The buyers were: Yuan Da buying 550 bales, Liao Ji buying 1,950 bales, Da Feng buying 900 bales, Geng Feng buying 2,650 bales, Ren Feng buying 800 bales, Sen Kang buying 650 bales, Chang Feng buying 2,400 bales, Run Kang buying 900 bales, and Shen Ji buying 600 bales.

<p>The cotton market was firm at first, then leveled off. Generally, cotton merchants and banks were bearish on the cotton market, due to abundant inventory and weak factory demand. However, the overseas cotton market appears to be temporarily stable. Although delivery of cotton futures for this month has been weak, and buyers are scarce, the final transaction price was 32.85 yuan, down 1.75 yuan from the February closing price of 34.6 yuan.</p>
<p>Near-Term Cotton Falls Uniquely by 0.3 Yuan</p>
<p>Cotton futures opened with extremely weak near-term market conditions, contrasting sharply with the yarn market. Generally, cotton merchants had a bearish outlook, and factories had no intention of taking delivery. As a result, although delivery was not active, there was an unusual shortage of buyers. The market became increasingly weak, but distant-month prices remained high because the situation in overseas cotton markets showed no signs of cracking. However, financial institutions again sold off at the close, selling 1,000 dan per month, and prices fell. As a result, this month's contract fell 0.2 yuan from the previous day's closing price, while distant-month prices remained flat. In the afternoon, near-term prices continued to weaken, while distant-month prices remained strong because news from Indian and American cotton markets was favorable, with no concerns about declines. As a result, near-month contracts fell by 0.1-0.15 yuan from the morning closing price, and distant-month contracts fell 0.05 yuan. It was found that Dafu sold 1,600 dan, Taixing sold 1,200 dan, Dafu sold 1,700 dan, Hexing sold 2,700 dan, Changyu sold 1,400 dan, Shenji sold 3,300 dan, Hengchang sold 5,800 dan, Yifeng sold 2,300 dan, Changhe sold 4,200 dan, Changfeng sold 3,500 dan, Shengyuan sold 1,500 dan, and Yikang sold 1,300 dan. The buyers were: Dafeng buying 3,800 dan, Dafu buying 1,800 dan, Yichang buying 1,000 dan, Senkang buying 1,000 dan, Zhenda buying 1,300 dan, Gengfeng buying 5,800 dan, Junchang buying 2,400 dan, Runkang buying 3,900 dan, Yuanxingchang buying 3,400 dan, Yuanda buying 1,700 dan, and Changhe buying 2,700 dan.

<p>(Mumbai) Last week, cotton prices were calm. American cotton prices fell, which triggered some profit-taking by bulls. However, the price difference with American cotton was close to 2%. In the middle of the week, most sellers were futures traders who used to be major bulls, but are now selling their buying positions. In terms of spot goods, exports have stagnated due to political and economic uncertainties in Europe. There were some small transactions with Japan. The attached statistics for last week are as follows (in thousands of bales):</p>

Continental and Japanese traders sold, and market prices were soft. Trading decreased, and traders remained cautious. Egyptian cotton prices fluctuated, but traders showed some interest. Demand for Upper Egyptian cotton was very good.</p>

<p>After the flour market opened in the morning, prices for all months fell uniformly. Imported wheat quotations: Chicago down about 45 points, Canada down about 23 points. When prices opened, the decline in imported wheat was quite sharp. Coupled with the easing tensions in Eastern Europe, the previous weekend's surge was based solely on international changes. Now, there's an unsubstantiated rumor, so it's not credible. Therefore, sentiment was already weak when prices opened. Soon, bulls exited positions and factories offered supplies, with near-term down by a small fraction and distant-term down by two or three fractions. When prices opened in the afternoon, market sentiment gradually improved. Although large and small factories continued to sell, outside buyers were superstitious about a tax increase on imported wheat, so they were keen to buy. The near-term was also tightening for spot flour, so opening prices rebounded step by step. As a result, this month ended down. April down only 7.5 hundredths of a cent. May down 1.5 cents. June down 1.25 cents. July down 1.75 cents. August down 2.75 cents.</p>
<p>After the wheat market opened in the morning, prices for all months fell uniformly. Imported wheat prices declined. When the market opened, the seriousness of the international situation had eased, and imported wheat was also reported down. Therefore, when prices opened, near-term months such as March and April fell only one or two cents due to actual demand. Distant-term months such as July and August fell sharply because industry players were hedging and bulls were actively exiting positions. The market dropped by a significant six or seven cents. When the market opened in the afternoon, trading in various months was slightly less active, and prices showed a slight upward trend. The flour market stabilized and there were rumors of a tax increase on imported wheat, so prices rebounded by one or two cents. As a result, the current month remained unchanged. July and August were down slightly four cents. The spot wheat market was flat and weak due to the free arrival of imported wheat. Anhui Bengbu wheat opened at 3.63 yuan. Shandong wheat opened at 3.66 yuan, totaling two thousand bags, by a new method.</p>

<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, a total of 24 or 25 boats arrived from various sources (a total of over 4,000 shi). Sales were still flat. Dealers from Tianjin, Qingdao, and Weihaiwei handled only six or seven hundred bags, so the overall market continued to weaken. Prices for various thick japonica and thin paddy rice varieties fell by one corner. Imported glutinous rice has not seen any trading. The trend is continuing to soften.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, over thirty boats arrived from various routes down the river. The market for various goods was stagnant and immobile. White japonica and Jiashan early rice prices were down by a corner, while thin paddy rice changed to yin yuan price and down by another small corner. Yangdu pointed rice price down by a small seven or eight cents. Other goods also showed a small downward trend.</p>
<p>(Imported Rice) Yesterday, the imported rice market stabilized. The supply has been continuous recently. Speculators were anxious to unload their holdings. Now, local merchants have revitalized their sales, and the widespread rumors of an increased tax on imported rice have made speculators' minds settle down again, no longer eager to sell. Besides the most active demand in Zhejiang province inland, the Shanghai-Nanjing railway area, such as Changzhou and Nanjing, is very active. Although there are new transactions on the Yangtze River, the direct distribution of goods by firms is continuous. Yesterday, the city opened about 10,000 bags of spot imported rice, 550 tons of recovered period rice, and 1,200 bags of customer indica and polished rice. The market conditions were similar to the previous market. Most of the sales went to inland dealers.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the market was driven by rumors of a tax increase, which, although not confirmed, seemed to have some basis, so sentiment remained firm. The Sugar Industry Cooperative held another auction yesterday. The amount was 3,300 bags of Guangdong coarse white sugar: (1) 2,500 bags of high-quality goods, bid price 17.3 yuan, (2) 800 bags of ordinary goods, bid price 17.2 yuan, up 3 corners from last Friday. As a result, buyers still sought more than the supply. Sold on a 26% proportional allocation basis. The association quoted 24 coarse sugar white at 17.3 yuan, with some transactions. Re-exported goods at 5.35 yuan, up about a corner, but no transactions. No. 8/9 Dutch red re-exported goods at 4.8 yuan, 100 bags transacted. Taikoo sugar gradually tightened, with the initial 50 bags at 18.05 yuan, later rising to 18.125 to 0.2 yuan, each transacting 50 bags, up 2 corners overall. The factory's refined white sugar has been continuing to open as raw material prices stabilize, up 7 corners. Zhenyu No. 1 at 16.9 yuan, No. 2 at 8 corners, No. 3 at 6.5 corners, No. 4 at 5 corners. The factory's rock sugar also rose 3 corners, No. 1 at 21.4 yuan, No. 2 at 21.3 yuan. Chao dealers offered over 300 bags of domestic refined white sugar, the higher quality at 16.8 yuan, the next grade at 17.23 yuan, and then 16 yuan to 15.8 yuan. Over 200 bags of refined red sugar, 11.5 to 4 corners, the next grade at 11 yuan to 07 corners. Chaoqing sugar also showed a firm trend, up a corner, with over 500 bags offered. Huanggang Qing at 10.12 yuan, the next grade at 9.8 yuan, Bannao Qing at 9.6 yuan, Longgang Qing at 9.5 to 4 corners.</p>

<p>Recently, the new harvest of Sichuan pickled mustard tuber in the producing areas has greatly impacted the market. Prices have fallen repeatedly, and those in this business are suffering losses. It is estimated that the remaining stock from last year totals over ten thousand pieces. Less than half have been sold to date. Ordinary goods have reached 11-12 yuan. The worst ones are around 10 yuan, high quality 14 yuan. Because the new goods are not cleared out of the old stock, people are watching and not daring to stock up too much. However, the high-quality goods once reached 600 pieces and opened two or three hundred trading, selling at 22 yuan, and the current market is at 10 yuan. Both merchants and traders, in view of the excessive ups and downs in the past, have reportedly formed cooperative companies to work together for mutual benefit.</p>

<p>Tea is a major international trade commodity and a source of rural economic vitality. However, the extreme financial tightness in Shanghai has had a major impact on the tea industry. Besides the tea industry's economic organization and its own funds, it needs at least ten million yuan or more in credit from money shops each year. In recent years, tea firms have maintained their credit with money shops, but money shops are extremely tight due to the financial crunch, making it difficult for tea firms to meet the funding needs of tea producing regions. A certain tea firm, which has been operating for many years, has announced its closure because its money shop failed to provide financing. Many tea manufacturers in the inland regions have also been unable to continue operating for this reason. According to comprehensive reports, the production of black and green tea this year is expected to decrease by 200,000 boxes. Chinese tea exports are declining not because of obstruction in foreign sales, but because of the large decrease in production due to financial stagnation. This is regrettable.</p>

<p>Recently, there has been little buying and selling of 40-foot-long deformed steel bars by factories and construction gangs. Export business has also been limited due to the urgent need for funds. Therefore, the market is sluggish. Considering the poor environment, the price trend is likely to decline further. Currently, popular sizes such as 3-fen and 7-fen sell for only 107-8 yuan per ton, while 5-fen sizes sell for only 98-9 yuan. Other common sizes are reportedly priced around 103-4 yuan, down two to three yuan to five or six yuan compared to last week. As new shipments arrive frequently and sentiment is very weak, it is difficult to be optimistic about future market conditions. Therefore, those in this business are quite pessimistic. It is reported that yesterday's transactions were only 30-40 tons, which was purchased by the Beijing-Shanghai Railway Bureau.</p>

<h3 id="e218">"Inertial Listlessness" <a href="#e218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>—Meng Jia</p>
<p>"Inertial listlessness" is not "our" ailment.</p>
<p>Like the "snake" characters in Gorky's "Song of the Falcon," who are content with the damp, warm, and dark burrows that he vehemently ridiculed, their "inactivity" is precisely because they fundamentally do not need to do anything. They drink fatty and greasy soup, take afternoon naps, and snore while sleeping; when they are in a good mood, they stroll with their wives or the like, wander around the park, attend banquets, and when they are tired of playing and lose interest, they stretch and exclaim, "How boring!" Oblomov's "longing to go far away" is nothing more than this kind of mentality. Moreover, as he himself acknowledged, the world does not need reforming, which is tantamount to saying that the world is too perfect? If people therefore believe that he really wants to "go far away," and that he does it "for humanity," then not only will Oblomov be laughed at as a fool, but we ourselves will also become fools. You think, with such a precious fellow who doesn't want to get married for fear of trouble, and is even too lazy to move house, can he really "go far away"?</p>
<p>The reason why Oblomov is like a docile pigeon, tucking his head under his wings, ready to spend his life under the same roof, is that this pigeon has too much food, so he wants to "retire to the forest" and hide in a warm nest doing comfortable things. If he had been starving long ago, or could not worry about tomorrow's food, even if he had memorized Yuan Zhonglang well, it would be difficult to have such great "elegance."</p>
<p>Turning the topic around, if "Mr. Luo" were alive now, he probably would not be so "hard-iron and taciturn," and silly. In his time, there were few things that could arouse abnormal excitement. There were no handball courts, no grand restaurants with naked dancers like Nora after she left home suspended above for the enjoyment of the guests, no dance halls with dance tickets and refreshments offered for one yuan and five cents, no "thrilling" soccer games with tickets costing five yuan. He was always curled up in his villa, eating, sleeping, eating, sleeping, always the same routine, and so "Mr. Luo" became "listless" and "melancholy." Alas, he was not born at the right time!</p>
<p>The Oblomovs of today are much smarter than before. Even if this is the laughter before death, they still want to enjoy it, and the ways of having fun are constantly emerging. "Inactivity as activity" makes them forget loneliness, and they even solemnly believe that they are "active" people.</p>
<p>"Inertial listlessness" is Daiyu or Baoyu's "idle sickness." And such a sickness seems to be a bit of the past. "Active listlessness," on the other hand, seems to be increasing and becoming more severe every day.</p>
<p>As for those who do not want to be "snakes" but cannot be "eagles," it is simply not "listlessness," but inexplicable "melancholy," although among them there are only a few who try to pretend to have a comfortable face—nothing more than "affectation."</p>
<h3 id="e219">After Dinner <a href="#e219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>—Lin Bin</p>
<p>Stepping out of the stinky little restaurant, feeling in my pocket: two dimes and a dozen or so copper coins. I don't have to worry about tomorrow's meal money!</p>
<p>Walking towards home (if you can call it that!), walking on the muddy slurry of the post-rain cobblestone road, feeling much more relaxed…</p>
<p>Suddenly, a thought flashed across my mind, catching a glimpse of the second landlord's opium face, and then a broken gong-like voice: "Rent! Overdue for a week!" The fleshy legs were like dragging chains, heavy.</p>
<p>—How to reply? … Oh, let's beat around the bush first! How to reply? …</p>
<p>Turning the corner: a burst of exotic fragrance, my head bumped into the shoulder of someone holding another person's arm, bounced back, and I saw: a college student!</p>
<p>"Don't you have eyes!" The eyes of the person with eyes were like sharp knives. The other person said: "Hmph!"</p>
<p>I returned a glance, meaning: What's so great! I'm a college graduate too, and I also have a lover, maybe even better than yours, although your crisp suit is more beautiful than my dirty cloth robe right now. Turning another corner: a cigarette and paper shop.</p>
<p>A worker took out three copper coins from his short pocket and threw them on the counter: "Two Company Brands."</p>
<p>My stomach itched, like worms crawling.</p>
<p>I slowed down my steps, felt in my robe pocket for three minutes, and finally took out three copper coins, like that worker, and threw them on the counter: "Two Company Brands…" But facing outwards, burning hot.</p>
<p>I put one in the corner of my mouth, lit it with the coil incense on the counter of another cigarette and paper shop, with a very arrogant air, telling the eyes钉着watching me in the counter: "This is not a Company Brand, it's a Big Beauty," but the heat on my face had not completely subsided.</p>
<p>My head was like a beehive, with countless bees buzzing: rent, how to reply…!</p>
<p>Walking, aimlessly walking…</p>
<p>My heart jumped, because:</p>
<p>Below the sidewalk, in the muddy slurry, a person was rolling around, no, a rare monster in the world: only the upper half of the legs were left, the ends wrapped in coarse burlap, and the burlap wrapped in muddy slurry. On the body, there were some rags, and in some places it looked like meat, it was unclear where the rags were and where the meat was, only muddy slurry. The face looked like it had just been dug out of a coal pile: no eyebrows, no eyelashes, only a pair of yellowish eyes, like a dying person, still radiating the last light of life. The corners of the mouth were almost pulled to the ears, with a mouth of yellow, smeared teeth. Shouting, raw shouting: "Sir! Madam! Do a good deed…"</p>
<p>A shiny car shot past like an arrow, splashing a burst of mud, splattering on the head, body, hands, and legs covered in mud, splattering on the yellowish pupils that were not covered in mud, wiping the mud on the pupils with a muddy hand.</p>
<p>Thinking: Why doesn't this kind of person roll into the Huangpu River? Why stay in the world to suffer such a living hell?…</p>
<p>On second thought: I was wrong. A black thread appeared before my eyes, one end holding his soul and the other end holding my soul.</p>
<p>——What about me? Yes, my legs are intact. I'm not lying rolling in the muddy slurry. I'm not shouting sir and madam on the street. But is it really different? No, the same, the essence of life is the same. The difference lies in the manner, in the degree.</p>
<p>I gritted my teeth and thought of everything…</p>
<p>"Hey, what are you doing standing here?"</p>
<p>My shoulder was patted, I turned my head: the great editor of the great magazine.</p>
<p>"Um."</p>
<p>"How's life been lately?"</p>
<p>"Um."</p>
<p>Seeing that he was about to leave, an invisible and powerful hand desperately squeezed words out of my throat:</p>
<p>"How's that manuscript I sent you a couple of weeks ago, Mr. ×? Please take a look as soon as possible… Help me out… I'm sorry… I can't help it…"</p>
<p>The editor nodded, smiled, and walked away, his mouth making no sound, but another mouth made a sound, the mouth of the "monster":</p>
<p>"Sir, Madam, do a good deed!"</p>

<p>Bless the livestock to grow tall and strong,</p>
<p>Bless the wheat fields to have a good harvest…</p>
<p>With hope,</p>
<p>In the New Year, the villagers happily light lanterns in various locations,</p>

<p>Like the ease with which hope dissipates,</p>

<p>Counting the New Year's expenses,</p>
<p>With worry—but pretending to have a lucky expression,</p>
<p>To the entrance of the lane, gathering the villagers for the "Dying Lantern" parade.</p>
<p>Carrying paper lanterns, only letting the gongs and drums bang and fill the world,</p>
<p>But no one can afford a string of firecrackers,</p>
<p>All the gorgeous clothes have been taken to the pawnshop,</p>
<p>Today we can only be ragged and tattered,</p>

<h3 id="e221">Qi Jin <a href="#e221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>—Chen Fuxi</p>
<p>"Mom, the classmates are saying again that I'm the son of a servant…"</p>
<p>"Let them say it."</p>
<p>A thick shadow lay on the mother's face.</p>
<p>Qi Jin was the son of Aunt Bao. Aunt Bao, as everyone knows, was a servant in the Zhang Mansion. Qi Jin lived with his mother in the mansion, and went to the nearby elementary school during the day.</p>
<p>There were many classmates at school, but everyone was prettier than Qi Jin. Qi Jin was a country bumpkin, with a dark face, worn-out, coarse cloth clothes, inarticulate, and not lively. From the moment he entered the school until now, he had been dull-witted all day long. The city kids could kick footballs, play with shuttlecocks, climb slides, jump ropes, and swing, but Qi Jin, as a newcomer to school, couldn't do any of these things. He was very lonely, and none of the classmates paid attention to him, and no one wanted to play with him. In the countryside, Qi Jin had many companions, riding on the backs of cows with them, throwing stones, or barefoot, running to the fields to find snails and catch green frogs, playing extraordinarily well; but once he arrived in the city, these things, for Qi Jin, were even unimaginable, and his attitude became so sluggish, walking slowly, almost trampling the ants on the ground to death. He was timid, cowardly, and when people deliberately scolded him or hit him, he didn't dare to resist, willing to suffer losses himself. However, city kids were very mischievous, and sometimes, some who were older than him, seeing Qi Jin, often intentionally brushed his shoulders or hit his head, and Qi Jin not only didn't hit back, but wouldn't even utter a word.</p>
<p>"Look at this countryman!…"</p>
<p>They shouted behind him. Shouting vigorously, they even threw stones at him. At school, he was truly an outcast, and no one was subjected to such bullying and humiliation as he was. It was as if his status was low, and the classmates who knew him were also unwilling to get close to him, as if being friendly with Qi Jin would make them lose face. Children have children's thoughts, and that kind of contemptuous, arrogant, and hypocritical thinking often exists even in innocent children, which is of course due to the poison given by the current society. They looked down on Qi Jin, which was pride, which was looking down on people. One day, a classmate lost a white copper ink box, and couldn't find it anywhere, so the classmates falsely accused Qi Jin of stealing it.</p>
<p>"You stole the ink box!"</p>
<p>"The ink box must have been stolen by the countryman!"</p>
<p>"I didn't steal it, I didn't…" Qi Jin said.</p>
<p>Qi Jin, surrounded by many classmates, was embarrassed. Everyone in the classroom said he stole it, one sentence from you, one sentence from me, and Qi Jin at this time didn't know how to argue. The next day, someone, no one knows who, found the stolen ink box in Qi Jin's book bag. When they pulled the ink box out of his book bag, everyone in the class laughed at him, saying he was a thief; saying his mother was a servant; saying he wore clothes, not knowing where he got them; saying he… such venomous, unsympathetic cold, he heard it, wanted to cry several times, but again tried his best to suppress it. He thought: did he really become a thief? How could the ink box be found in his book bag? But he also thought that he had indeed not stolen it. When he came out of the mansion in the morning, there was no ink box in his book bag! Then where did the ink box now found in his book bag come from? Could it have flown from the sky? He was young, honest by nature, and truly bewildered by this unwarranted slander. In the classroom, amidst the mockery, Qi Jin sat on the stool, his face blushing, not speaking, his head only felt a wave of dizziness.</p>
<p>"Everyone look at this little thief!"</p>
<p>When school was over and he was walking on the road, the classmates were still shouting loudly. But Qi Jin remained silent, as if admitting it. He lowered his head, looking at the ground, walking step by step, not daring to glance sideways at the roadside. When he walked back to Zhang Mansion, his heart trembled especially.</p>
<p>"Mom, the classmates are saying again that I'm…"</p>
<p>"Let them say it, Qi Jin."</p>
<p>However, Qi Jin, standing in front of his mother at this time, couldn't help but cry. Two lines of bright hot tears hung on his dark, thin face.</p>
<h3 id="e222">Viewing Plum Blossoms at Yoshino <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>— Zhao Qi</p>
<p>(Part Two)</p>
<p>Having passed through the small green-lacquered fence, I looked toward the gate adorned with the three characters "Rakurakuen" (Pleasure Garden) formed by plum blossoms, expecting it to be as noisy as the Meiyuan Garden in Wuxi, with hawkers, miscellaneous vendors, and rickshaw pullers. Contrary to my expectation, this preconceived notion was completely shattered, and I felt that it was purely a poetic realm. As I was about to enter the gate, beside the entrance was a wreath made of old plum branches, topped with a newly designed umbrella. Here stood a very beautiful young woman who personally pinned a paper plum blossom on the lapel of every visitor, regardless of age or gender, and presented a small package tied with colored string. Inside were a map showing the route, ferry tickets, candies that children loved, and a few refreshing pills. On her short sleeve was a red cloth with the words "Guidance" written on it, indicating that she was a guide dispatched by the Yoshino residents who welcomed tourists.</p>
<p>Entering the garden gate, I realized that it was not a garden, but a mountainside slope. We followed the winding path downwards, and in front of each household, high and low, there was a flower stand displaying various potted plants, marked with prices ranging from a few yuan to tens of cents. Below, a clear stream flowed, its gurgling sound resembling琴 music. I found a red line on the guidance map, which was the one called the奥多摩 River. After crossing the river, we walked up a dense pine path. The signpost pointed to the left, indicating the Yoshino plum blossom area. Standing there for a moment, I looked out into the distance. The area was surrounded by light green screens, with a pile of transparent cotton-like bodies in the middle, resembling shaved ice in a light blue glass bowl. This was because it was all white plum blossoms without any other varieties.</p>
<p>After walking a few steps, we entered a deep and winding plum blossom alley. The young ladies from the city, at this time, had taken off their coats, revealing their powder-covered necks and backs embroidered with flowers and birds, perfectly complementing the pure white blossoms, creating a sense of harmonious color and a unique oriental beauty.</p>
<p>The plum blossom area is over ten 里 (li, a Chinese unit of distance) in circumference. It is originally a large plum village, and the thatched houses of each household are hidden among the plum blossoms. The most flourishing places are the Meio-ken (Plum Oriole Pavilion) and the Keikei-en (Plum Brook Garden). We first passed by the Meio-ken, wandered around, and sat down on a cushion under the eaves of a house. I ordered a tempura (a Japanese dish), and the waitress was several times more respectful than those in the city. However, in the end, the price of even one fish was several times higher than in the city. The Japanese all brought their own lunch boxes because they knew this.</p>
<p>The sun was quietly setting, and we set off for the Keikei-en again. I felt that the branches of the plum trees were the most beautiful here. The wrinkled and reclining branches were all suitable for the composition of a painting. Sure enough, along the stream, I saw many stone tablets leaning against the pavilions, engraved with the years and inscriptions by xxxx painters and poets. As we walked further, we happened to meet those elderly scholars from the same train, sitting cross-legged under a cluster of flowers, with two lightly made-up young ladies pouring wine and grinding ink for them.</p>
<p>After we finished taking some pictures here, the sun had moved the shadow of the plum blossoms from the water surface to the opposite bank. I heard people say that it was only one and a half 里 (li) from here to 青梅 Station, so we decided to take the train at 青梅 Station.</p>
<p>Before leaving, what made me wonder was that there were various wooden signs to guide tourists, but why was there no sign saying "No Picking Flowers"? Perhaps the manager had overlooked this in his considerations!</p>
<p>Arriving at 青梅 Station, I sat down tiredly. Similarly, there was a young woman standing in that kind of flower wreath. The bright red afterglow shone on her smiling face, and her slender shadow stretched out as she offered a cup of tea to each of us and said a gentle word of comfort.</p>
<p>At 4:50, the train arrived. Most of the people in the carriage were returning from the plum grove. Seeing that even the children's clothes had nothing but a paper plum blossom pinned on them, I felt a deep shock in my heart. When people were thrown about by the train to the point of drooping their heads, I dared to quietly take off the flower I had picked from the plum grove and pinned on my hat, and dropped it out of the window.</p>

<p>— By Tokunaga Sunao, translated by Ye Yin</p>
<p>One-handed Xiong, not only had only one hand, but was also a cripple. At night, he would often spread out empty straw sacks on the dirt floor without flooring in my house and sleep with my dog named "Ba." Without bedding or anything else, he would take a half-piece of red felt, suitably place it on his head, and hug "Ba" to sleep. This had become his habit.</p>
<p>During the day, he would go to other people's houses to do odd jobs or help patients buy things, earning some money to buy "leftover food." When he earned a little more money, he would immediately start drinking. At that time, he, who was usually silent and taciturn, would become boisterous and garrulous.</p>
<p>His face protruded with huge cheekbones. When he smiled, many very large wrinkles would appear on his forehead and mouth.</p>
<p>Whenever the children saw Xiong going out to buy things with a medicine bottle, they would often come up and shout loudly:</p>
<p>"Lame Xiong, what time is it now..."</p>
<p>At this time, the wrinkles would appear on Xiong's face, and he would answer:</p>
<p>"Fifteen o'clock."</p>
<p>At the same time, he would make funny faces and dance for people to watch.</p>

<h3 id="e224">Liu Feifei is Not a Movie Fan <a href="#e224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>— Meng Ruo</p>
<p>The death of the movie star Ruan Lingyu has evoked great sympathy from many people in society. According to recent reports, a young woman from Hunan, Liu Feifei, was extremely indignant upon learning of Ruan Lingyu's suicide. She believed that Zhang Damin and Tang Jishan were the criminals responsible for Ruan Lingyu's death, one being greedy and shameless, and the other having found a new love. Therefore, she traveled all the way from Hunan to Nanjing to ask her cousin, Mr. Li, to introduce her to the film industry so that she could avenge Ruan Lingyu.</p>
<p>Regarding the actions of this young woman from Hunan, Liu Feifei, many people in society will surely say that she is obsessed with movies. What does Ruan Lingyu's death have to do with her? Yet, she resolutely decided to sacrifice herself to avenge Ruan Lingyu. This kind of behavior is indeed too peculiar. What else could it be but movie fanaticism? However, Liu Feifei's actions, while certainly a bit peculiar, do seem like she has indeed become a movie fan. But upon closer inspection, Liu Feifei's behavior may contain other meanings as well.</p>
<p>Liu Feifei's sympathy for Ruan Lingyu and her admiration for Ruan Lingyu's art are certainly important factors. But beyond this factor, we suspect that she also holds a desire to seek justice for oppressed women. She firmly believes that Ruan Lingyu's suicide was caused by the oppression of Zhang Damin and Tang Jishan. Therefore, in order to seek justice for oppressed women, she decided to sacrifice herself to avenge Ruan Lingyu. If our speculation is correct, then we cannot simply dismiss Liu Feifei's behavior as movie fanaticism. It is actually very meaningful and worthy of praise.</p>
<p>However, here we want to tell Liu Feifei that it was Zhang Damin and Tang Jishan who oppressed Ruan Lingyu. But in today's Chinese society, Ruan Lingyu is not the only woman being oppressed, and Zhang Damin and Tang Jishan are not the only men oppressing women. Therefore, we believe that if Liu Feifei truly holds the desire to seek justice for oppressed women, avenging Zhang Damin and Tang Jishan is not enough. We should be bolder and resist all men in society who oppress women. Only in this way can women achieve true liberation.</p>

<p>The vast river water reveals undulating waves. A light boat floats in the middle of the stream, gently teasing the waves like a water gull.</p>
<p>"We're arriving soon, passengers please get up and pack your luggage!" the sailor shouted.</p>
<p>Startled awake, I blankly lowered my head for a moment, pushed open the boat window and looked out. The towering "Jintan" (brand name) billboard in the sky stared with a smiling face as it overlooked the passing river and the bright setting sun.</p>
<p>Walking out of the cabin door, I released the stuffy air that had been pent up in my chest all day, feeling as if I had lost several pounds.</p>
<p>Guanyin Island, shrouded in the evening mist, seemed to be swallowed up by the rushing water, while Chenglingji, facing it across the bank, flashed an arrogant face, guarding this gateway that must be passed through.</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>This is the confluence of the Yangtze River and the Xiang River. To reach Yueyang, one must go upstream. Therefore, when our boat turned into the adverse current, two sailors took up their poles, and two sailors went ashore to pull the tow rope. In the late autumn lakeside of Dongting, the reed flowers were bleak and the mud was knee-deep. The sailors pulling the tow rope struggled forward on this difficult journey.</p>
<p>The boat berthed at the lower bay of Yueyang City. The lake was already deeply locked in a sheet of evening mist. Junshan Island, rising from the center of the lake, only existed in our vague memories.</p>
<p>There was a burst of noise on the boat as everyone collected their money, each carrying their large and small packages and rushing ashore.</p>
<p>On the shore, the pebbles, rounded and clear from the impact of the lake waves, had a magical power that made us stumble at every step. The remaining light of a few fishing lamps peeking out from the thatched sheds further confused our desired destination.</p>
<p>Finally, we found the gate of Yueyang Tower. The gate was gloomy like a bottomless cave. Even though it was a clear day, the stone steps were covered with mud. There was no light, only a flickering kerosene lamp, as small as a firefly, lined up at the end of the city gate.</p>
<p>"Friend, be careful not to fall." Someone walking ahead warned me like this.</p>
<p>Turning onto an uneven street, the sparse streetlights and desolate shadows presented an image of economic depression. It was only seven or eight o'clock, but some of the shops were already closed tightly. Only a few tea houses and hotels still had some noise to decorate the night of this ancient city.</p>
<p>Mr. So-and-so and I stayed in a small inn in Chaijia Ridge. The broken windows and walls were pathetically small, and cobwebs were stretched everywhere. The traces of travelers' graffiti on the walls were all blurred. A musty smell was rampant throughout the room.</p>
<p>"This room hasn't been inhabited for a long time, has it?"</p>
<p>We sat down, drank a cup of tea, and asked this question.</p>
<p>"Business has been bad recently. No one has any business, no matter which one!" the tea attendant said, then sighed.</p>
<p>"Why don't you clean up? This way, no one will come!"</p>
<p>"How can we not clean up? 'A house needs people to make it.' It's been a long time since we've had a guest. The boss has dismissed several of us employees. Now there's only me left. I have to cook, how can I have time!" He said tiredly.</p>
<p>"If there are more guests, who will serve them?"</p>
<p>"When there are many, the boss and the landlady will come to help."</p>
<p>Finally, we changed to a room, and the price increased to one thousand four hundred, but it was cleaner than the original one. After eating a simple dinner, because we had to catch the train the next day, Mr. So-and-so suggested taking a night tour of Yueyang Tower.</p>
<p>Guided by the tea attendant, we stepped onto the stone steps, turned a bend, and arrived at the main hall of Lu Zu. The Buddhist statues and shrines were brand new. The plaques and couplets had very few ancient relics. From this, we knew that they had all been destroyed in the fires of war. However, the "believers" came in droves to burn incense and pray, and the monks were busy ringing bells and drumming, as if the prosperity and market of Yueyang had moved here! It can be seen how superstitious the foolish men and women are in this decadent Chinese society, relying on the gods to save them from the depths of misery! Turning to the open space on the third floor, under a weeping electric light, the dark lake water floated together with the sky. The words carved on the surrounding walls were mottled and had turned white. Even Fan Zhongyan's preface carved on the wooden planks seemed to have a sense of vicissitudes.</p>
<p>It was already ten o'clock when we returned to the inn. The next day, before dawn, we left this ancient city that stole its reputation.</p>

<h3 id="e227">The Sorrow of a Great Talent <a href="#e227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>— Ye Fei</p>
<p>The great talent has been an apprentice in this barbershop for almost two years, but the whip marks on his body are increasing with the years, months, days, and hours. By now, he himself does not know how many whip marks he has on his body. And no one else has ever counted them for him, and even if there were such a person who would count them for him, they would not necessarily be able to count them clearly. Because every day, when he is lazy or makes a mistake (in his master's eyes), he has to be beaten by his master. But every day after he is beaten, he is never seen to cry even once. This is not because he can't cry, but because his master doesn't allow him to cry. If he cries! There is a risk of being beaten even more severely! He understands that an apprentice can only endure. Even if he is wronged by the master, he can only swallow his anger and has no right to spit it out. Therefore, the master is only allowed to beat himself, but he is not allowed to cry out. However, the great talent is not afraid to cry; he knows that it is useless to shed these extra tears in front of the master. His master will not necessarily soften because of this; on the contrary, it is simply equivalent to begging for a living.</p>
<p>He remembers that since the year his mother put on a new blue cloth gown, the first new clothes he had ever worn in his life, and lit a pair of five-lamp candles in front of the family altar, he kowtowed three times to the family altar, then bowed to the people in the surrounding villages, and followed a cousin to leave home. It seemed that at this time, his mother, who was not very old but looked very old on her face, still saw him off for a while. As the boat left the dock, his mother, with tears in her eyes, urged him like this: "Great talent, go with your uncle. There is no food for you to eat at home. Go to Shanghai and eat your fill! But be careful in everything, and listen to your master. Remember what your mother says. Shanghai is a good place. See how hard it is in the countryside! I hope that when you have finished your apprenticeship and come back, you will bring some glory to your dead father. Then my half-life of suffering will not have been in vain..." She cried before she could finish speaking.</p>
<p>At this time, the great talent seemed to have no feeling. He did not laugh, nor did he cry, nor did he speak. His eyes were only staring blankly at his mother's thin face, which was covered with tears. He did not understand his mother's heart. She wanted him to go to learn a trade, so why was she crying now? He had not analyzed any of his mother's words in his own heart. He only knew that Shanghai was a good place, and he should be happy to have the opportunity to go to this good place. Although he had thought that he would be separated from his mother, with whom he depended for life, and that this separation would be so far away for three years; at that time, he was indeed somewhat sad, but this only sorrow was ultimately buried by this dream of longing.</p>
<p>In that year, he entered this barbershop, and at the same time lit red candles that were dozens of times larger than the pair of five-lamp candles lit in front of his own family altar, and then respectfully kowtowed three times to a big man. After his cousin taught him to call him master, he entrusted his entire fate to that master. So, every day, he swept the floor, washed towels, wiped the equipment, boiled water, and arranged the towels, starting his apprenticeship. In the blink of an eye, two years passed, and only sadness and pain continued to increase on his body, and the so-called dream of longing was completely shattered! He felt that his mother's words were wrong, what about eating his fill, good place, and bringing some glory to his dead father!</p>

<p>— Pin Yun</p>
<p>Aunt Siwei hobbled out of Uncle Siwei's two black-lacquered doors, with only a faded red cloth package, the one she had when she got married, hanging on her wrist. Her face was very unpleasant as she staggered towards the path outside the village in the twilight.</p>
<p>In the evening, wisps of curling smoke floated from the rooftops of the village houses, poetically drifting straight into the sky, slowly dissipating along with the light clouds across the blue sky. At this time, the air in the village was particularly quiet. Even the little dogs sleeping at the door were too lazy to raise their heads. Only the villagers, covered in muddy stains, returned from their work in the fields, and on their way home, they often turned their heads to scan Aunt Siwei, who was walking unsteadily with her head down like a homeless dog, with strange eyes.</p>
<p>Arriving at her mother's house, a sudden burst of sorrow assaulted Aunt Siwei's heart, and her eyes seemed to be covered by a gloomy cloud of sorrow. She remembered the decline and dilapidation of her mother's house, and her father's early death. A string of bitter tears could not help but flow from her eyes. However, what could she do? If she didn't go to her mother's house, where else could she go? So, she stretched out her trembling hand and gently pushed open the moldy, old, and dilapidated bamboo door.</p>
<p>"Grandma, the aunt has come back... Aunt, why are you back so late? Alone?... "The sister-in-law was feeding the chickens in the courtyard and hurriedly put down the chicken feed and came forward to greet her. "What's wrong? Aunt, are your eyes bad? Why are they swollen and painful like two rotten walnuts?"</p>
<p>Aunt Siwei did not reply at all. She strode into the courtyard with all her might, threw the faded red cloth package on the dirty mud floor, and fell into her mother's arms, crying out like a child who had been wronged.</p>
<p>The sister-in-law was also stunned and did not even bother to close the bamboo door. She followed closely behind her aunt, crossed the courtyard, and startled the chickens that were pecking at food in the yard.</p>
<p>"Qiao'er, why are you crying so much!... Did you suffer any grievances on the way, or in your husband's house?..."</p>
<p>After a bout of weeping, Aunt Siwei seemed to feel a little tired. The crying was slightly softer than before, and her throat was gasping as if she could not breathe. She tilted her head and looked at her mother's senile appearance: the sparse hair on her temples was white like a few strands of silver silk, and the hand that was stroking her hair was also dry and thin like firewood. So, her heart felt sad and painful again, and tears welled up in her eyes like mountain springs.</p>
<p>"Qiao'er, what exactly happened? Tell your mother... "The old woman's voice trembled a little, and she became more anxious.</p>
<p>"Mom, I... That damned man... doesn't want me anymore. He's going to marry... a young vixen, saying that I just eat his family's food and can't... give... him a son!... "Aunt Siwei said intermittently, and at the same time, the gasping in her throat became even more rapid.</p>
<p>"That's outrageous! The Siwei family must have gone crazy! Actually, the aunt is only in her thirties. Who dares to say that she won't be able to have children in the future!" the sister-in-law exclaimed angrily. "Their ancestors didn't accumulate virtue and had no luck to have children. Who can they blame! Aunt, don't cry. Tomorrow, we'll gather some people to go to the Siwei family and argue with him. Does he think he can abuse people just because he has some stinking money? If not, there are still village rules in the village..."</p>
<p>The mother's head swayed like a willow in the wind, and she could not say half a word. It was clear that her elderly heart was as broken as Aunt Siwei's.</p>
<p>Aunt Siwei lived in her mother's house like this, for one month, two months, three months... At first, the sister-in-law was still very sympathetic to her and took care of her. However, as time went on, although her mother still loved her in the same way, the sister-in-law's attitude towards her became as thin as the morning mist. Sometimes, she even used many small incidents to insinuate her with the tone of scolding livestock, mocking her, as if she were not a member of the family! When the neighbors secretly discussed her, and when the sister-in-law ridiculed her, her chest felt as painful as if it had been pierced by a poisonous arrow. She felt that she was the most miserable person in the world! She could only secretly shed hot tears to vent her full of bitterness.</p>

<p>Opening "Song of Grieving for Spring"</p>
<p>Fair face gaunt, thinking of embracing spring. Husband and wife separated, failing to live up to spring. Thinking back to when the wedding night was filled with passionate love, the hibiscus curtains warm, spending the night in spring. Under the dressing table, slowly watching, eyebrows painted lightly, a smile containing spring. A moment of gold wasted away, now as cold as ice and ashes, doubly grieving for spring. Cunning brother, partial to eloquent words, containing sour plums, bitterly meeting spring. The aunt doesn't understand, who can redeem it? Can I be heartless, not cherishing spring? New people have new smiles, how can the old wife weep away the remnant of spring? The lovely daughter is lively and diligently asks, "Daddy, why are you separated and abandoning spring?" Tears, bitterness, like a dream, hating that there are no comforting words, falsely scolding spring. The curtains are down, the sound is silent, the incense burns out, too lazy to stir the spring in the silent furnace. Tasting medicine, wondering who will take care of me, too much illness, after all, little return to spring. Vainly living through the years, no other thoughts, flesh and blood children are like the spring in my eyes. The calamity of Huang Yang can be expected, reunion like the spring in the mirror. Heaven and earth are not eternal, this lingering hatred misunderstands youth. It is truly like fallen grass wilting in spring.</p>

<h3 id="e233">On the Establishment of the Ruan Lingyu Acting Award <a href="#e233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>A few days ago, this magazine had an article "Preliminary Proposal for Establishing the Ruan Lingyu Acting Award." At that time, after reading it, I had a feeling of excitement and anxiety. In order to promote the efforts of Chinese film actors in acting and the health of their lifestyle, to eliminate the pessimistic atmosphere, and also to commemorate the death of a generation of artist Ruan Lingyu, the establishment of this award does have its great significance. Therefore, at that time I was quite excited. But I also considered this proposal myself: It is very difficult for the Chinese film industry to have an organization, which everyone knows very clearly. For example, there used to be a Film Association, but because it was subject to some objective resistance, everyone was not enthusiastic, and it soon disappeared. Later, there was a film tea party, which was just a casual chat, but if everyone was enthusiastic and caring, it was not without benefits, and it was possible to talk about things that were beneficial to everyone. But I don't know how, it soon disappeared invisibly. Now there is nothing. Film practitioners are all groping independently in the dark. They don't communicate with each other. Even an organization like a film library or a film research association is not possible to realize. In view of these facts, I can't help but worry about the establishment of this acting award, although this is due to excessive excitement.</p>
<p>Sure enough, after that article was proposed, there was no significant response. In particular, the gentlemen of the film industry did not put forward concrete opinions, although the author of that article was expecting a lively discussion. Of course, Chinese people have always believed in the philosophy of life of "sweeping the snow in front of their own doors," but for this matter that is for others and for themselves, it is not appropriate to be too silent, right? But I always believe that the success of a social undertaking must have a few foolish people who are doing their best to do it. At least I personally have to provide some opinions as a reference.</p>
<p>Regarding the realization of this award, the most important thing is the source of funding. Of course, if one person is awarded each year, and if the award is 200 yuan, then there must be a fund of 2,000 yuan. (If 2,000 yuan is deposited for a long time, it can get 200 yuan at an annual interest rate of 1%). This is not a small number, and no one will be willing to donate it alone. Moreover, individual donations are not as meaningful as social fundraising. Therefore, I believe that the method of raising funds should be based on the principle of truly obtaining it from the social audience. Because only enthusiastic audiences are strong supporters of Chinese films, and only a broad audience is the most sincere protector of film actors, and also a strong monitor of their lives and behaviors. Then, under this principle, I think there are three ways that can work.</p>
<p>First, fundraising. Establish a fundraising committee and collect donations separately in various theaters, schools and other educational organizations.</p>
<p>Second, with the consent of Lianhua Company, donate the screening of Ruan Lingyu's most outstanding works, with the ticket revenue as part of the fund.</p>
<p>Third, perform a play. Since Ruan Lingyu's death, general amusement parks have regarded her as the same way to produce wealth as Ge Ruixiong or Huang Hui, and everyone has adapted her death into dramas such as "The Fall of a Fragrant Jade." Needless to say, in those timely scripts, it is very unlikely that we can ask for a true analysis of Ruan Lingyu's outlook on life and the cause of her death. On the contrary, it is just a mess like traveling to the underworld. Then, if we can perform a play well to commemorate Ruan Lingyu, it is definitely not without meaning, and at the same time, this income will be used to raise funds.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, they are all within the possible range. What is left is the trouble of implementation. Perhaps in addition to this, there are better ways. This is waiting for enthusiastic discussion by people who care about Chinese films.</p>
<p>Editor's Note: Since the publication of Mr. Xudong's "Preliminary Proposal for Establishing the Ruan Lingyu Acting Award" in this magazine on March 19, this magazine has received several letters, all expressing their agreement and willing to do their best to donate, but hoping that this magazine will lead the planning and implementation, so that a meaningful plan will not end up in vain, which is very gratifying. However, it is a pity that no concrete opinions have been put forward, and the respondents are few, which shows that people in society do not yet have a deep understanding of the event. Recalling the day of Ms. Ruan's burial, men and women in Shanghai went to watch the funeral, and the road was filled with people. From this, we know that there are many idle people watching the excitement, but there are still few people who take out their empty bodies and do some useful things for the social crowd, which is very disappointing. Fortunately, Mr. Ling showed us this article, and we are eager to expose it in the hope that someone will be inspired to rise up. We especially hope that film practitioners, for the sake of their own interests, can put forward considerable concrete measures or contribute useful opinions (the text does not have to be published, but it is enough to provide it for reference). Not smart.</p>

<h3 id="e234">Review of "Slick Spirit Medium" <a href="#e234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>— Ji Han</p>
<p>Their Big Moment</p>
<p>——Da Shanghai Screening</p>
<p>If we admit that this film was made because of the two embarrassing faces of ZaSu Pitts and Zasu Pitts and Slim Summerville, then people's first attention is on their acting skills. Generally speaking, ZaSu Pitts is not incapable of acting. The development of her personality can indeed become a typical representative of ordinary honest women. Therefore, when she plays a supporting role in certain works, she often makes people laugh, and at the same time makes people deeply appreciate the goodness and loveliness of human nature. But profit-seeking film merchants often injure actors in order to reluctantly cater to the audience's preferences. For example, ZaSu Pitts has to repeatedly produce some nonsensical and humorous short films, which is an example. So under the control of these vulgar filmmakers, she lost the audience's sympathy, and she was just a vulgar thing in Hollywood. As for Slim Summerville, who has acted in humorous films such as "Legal Eagles," he has never had better results. Perhaps some people say that he doesn't make a lot of noise, but he can't go deep into the real life. All he can do is a face that seems to be an honest person and seems to be a fool, using a relatively static posture to make people laugh. However, now is the time when people regard humor as humor, so some people are quite satisfied with him. Because of this, his works are also welcomed by a part of the audience.</p>
<p>Now let's look at this "talking nonsense" "Slick Spirit Medium" Here is another unrealistic and almost mythical story, which cannot arouse our much interest. The content is also empty, vulgar and boring. What good plays can be seen at the session, not to mention that the director is just a plain and unremarkable narration of the story. Although it can sometimes make people laugh, the whole play cannot arouse people's emotional resonance. ZaSu Pitts and Slim Summerville are just repeating the old tunes and repeating their original acting skills, without any new tricks. They were not originally talented actors, not to mention that they are here under a director with not much creative ability? The result is conceivable. Although this is a work made because of the actors, their acting skills cannot make people laugh heartily.</p>

<p>— Luo Ping</p>
<p>Since Carl Laemmle first put the names of stars on the screen, the star system has been quickly established; it has been popular until now.</p>
<p>However, no one can deny that the star system has its own drawbacks. To give an example, because too much emphasis is placed on the "star system," the death of a certain actress has at least given film merchants who rely on this system a not small loss.</p>
<p>Recently, directors Shen Xicen and Shi Dongwang solved the problem of ranking by the number of strokes in their surnames or the order of their appearances. Although this is not a fundamental solution, this new and progressive method is worth recommending to every film director.</p>
<p>American producer Samuel Goldwyn is offering a reward of £20,000 for a simple story for his brother Conrad's new film.</p>
<p>There is now a prevailing criticism of tragic films, saying that sad themes will make many petty citizens increase their decadent and depressed emotions, and even believe that they "poison" the audience in the same way as pornographic films. However, who can deny that as a film art that reflects the reality of "life", it is impossible to have "happy" themes in this tragic real world?</p>

<p>Bu Wancang went to Jinhua a few days ago to survey the location for his new work "Triumph." He returned to Shanghai yesterday. Du Yu is specially invited to take the photography of this film, who has been studying optics.</p>
<p>Zhou Ke has become the first position among cinematographers in the Chinese film industry today. He recently took on the photography of "At the Beginning of Man." The excellent results can be predicted.</p>
<p>"The Storm" went to Nanjing Road and its surrounding areas yesterday to shoot daytime scenes. "The Storm" is another pioneer in taking daytime scenes of Nanjing Road in the film. Yihua's newcomer Zhang Wen is 29 years old, beautiful, good at music, and has received secondary education. She also has a good understanding of film scripts.</p>
<p>Yihua's new film "Escape" has achieved excellent results, and a special issue of "Escape" has been published. The cover is printed in three colors, and the content is rich in pictures and texts. It has been sent to print and will be given away with tickets in Jincheng soon.</p>
<p>The release date of "Elegy of Life" is not far away.</p>
<p>Zheng Yingshi's new script has been sent to Beijing for review.</p>
<h3 id="e237">The Director of "Escape" <a href="#e237" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c237" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">237</a></h3>
<p>The director of "Escape" is Mr. Yue Feng, who is very young, short in stature, and has a Chaplin-style mustache on his lips. His debut work was "The Rage of the Chinese Sea," which depicts the suffering of fishermen. Although this film suffered various obstacles and lost its original true face: those moving and beautiful pictures and techniques were also removed a lot, but it is still better than ordinary low-level and mediocre films.</p>
<p>"Escape" is his second work. The theme is very realistic. Under his smart and lively directing skills, it has achieved greater success. The greatness and grandeur of the pictures, the tension and excitement of the story's progress, the accuracy and beauty of the lens angles... everything is worthy of our praise. Therefore, generally speaking, "Escape" is the first and most powerful and successful exposé film in the history of Chinese films! At least; the unique style of this film can awaken the audience's ears and eyes.</p>

<p>— Mao De</p>
<p>And if Miye Fa, out of fear or insincerity, fails to defect as scheduled, then the entire plan will fail. Clive, in distress and worry, his wife came in. She was holding a bunch of flowers in her hand. She said in a low voice: "After you left, I was just thinking of going to church." Clive nodded and said: "Suddenly it has been two years." That's right, it's been two years. On this day two years ago, they buried the little Clive in a church cemetery in London. Clive thought of it and couldn't help but sadly said: "Margretti, I don't know if you will hate me. I have caused you such a great loss and suffered such great pain. I only know how to take, but you are giving."</p>
<p>Margretti also sadly said: "Robert, please don't do this. You are also giving. We will safely get through all the difficulties, won't we?" Clive took her hand and kissed it. She asked again: "How long will this war take?" Clive said: "One month... two months... it's not certain. Sala Ut Du La and his army are stationed opposite Parasi. Miye Fa is also there. He promised to defect and help me." Margretti said: "Do you believe what he says?" Clive said: "At least I believe what he says?" Clive said: "At least I believe his greed, he wants to be emperor. Maybe this time we will win without a fight! Then peace, hometown, wealth, and settlement are all ours"</p>
<p>Margretti leaned on her husband. Clive asked sadly again: "Margretti, tell me one thing. Suppose I am standing at a fork in the road. If I advance and win, there is naturally nothing to say. If I lose, that is our destruction. Sala Ut Du La has no mercy for men, women, and children... Tell me, do you allow me or not, let me advance automatically?" Margretti looked at his face, hesitated for a while, and then said: "Robert, you know, I am very simple, but I know that no one can stop a man like you."</p>
<p>Clive nodded gratefully. She is always understanding. She has never violated his wishes. The horn sounded again outside, and he had to go out. He hugged her tightly in his arms, tenderly for a while, and then said in a low voice: "Goodbye." The two of them had to separate, as if some force was tearing them apart. Clive then hurried away.</p>
<p>Clive and his team waited quietly for ten days, hiding in the forest, not daring to cross the river. Those days were days of fear and panic. If Mill Yefa betrayed his promise, then the tragic consequences he would get would far outweigh the Black Hole of Calcutta incident recorded in history. At that time, Sala Ut Du La put 146 British people in a cave, which had only one small hole for air. So after a day, the people inside suffocated to death, leaving only three or four people struggling for their lives. Because of this inhuman behavior, Clive decided to ally with Mill Yefa to remove this demon Sala Ut Du La. If he could not remove him, the British would never have a peaceful day in India. But this was an extremely risky move.</p>
<p>At this time, the Governor specially ran from Fort Saint David to check the situation. He brought a pair of Margretti's letters. Clive took the letter, put it in his pocket, and did not open it to read. The Governor asked him how the future was. Clive answered casually, Mill Yefa. But he can go to the front at any time.</p>

<h3 id="e239">Recent Trends in Residential Architecture <a href="#e239" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c239" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">239</a></h3>
<p>— Xi Hao</p>
<p>The rapid advancement of architecture in recent years has truly surpassed other applied sciences. Especially in residential architecture, there has been significant progress not only in technology and form but also new developments in the most important fundamental concepts and design. This is truly a characteristic of 20th-century architecture and an unprecedented bright page in architectural history.</p>
<p>In the 19th century and before, engineers' understanding of the meaning of "residence" was indeed very superficial. They believed that a "residence" was merely a place for people to return to at night after labor. Therefore, the "residential" buildings of that time were only used to shield from wind and rain and prevent unexpected attacks. Although the exteriors had magnificent stone heights, engineers have now recognized a deeper meaning in 20th-century "residences." Modern "residences" are not only for resting weary humans but also permanent comforters of mankind. This is indeed the main distinguishing point between residential architecture of the past and present.</p>
<p>Harmony and delicacy are the characteristics of new-style residences. The first success of harmony lies in the appropriate proportions of each part of the residence. In past residential buildings, deep consideration was often not given to the volume of each room, resulting in inconvenience when put to use. For example, living rooms were excessively large, and factories were too small. This kind of disproportion not only caused excessive consumption of materials but also depreciated the value of the entire building. The advantage of new-style residences is the commensurate proportion of each part's volume, ensuring that the homeowner can easily manage everything and obtain a comfortable aesthetic.</p>
<p>The color design of the interior and exterior of residences was never considered by engineers in the 19th century, which was indeed a great mistake. Color has a great impact on people's feelings. The appropriate arrangement of colors, especially indoors where sunlight is reflected, can bring pleasure and comfort to the entire mind. Now, the architectural community in various countries has engineers specializing in the study of color design in architecture. This is indeed unprecedented. Due to the rapid adoption of light metals, the successful arrangement of beautiful artificial pigments for construction, aluminum foil, zinc paint, etc., are now very commonly used.</p>
<p>Modern engineers have abandoned the generally old-fashioned and clumsy thick walls in the design of residences. Because of the continuous invention of new building materials, the formerly bulky pillars have been replaced by light steel frame combination beams. In general, in new-style residences, you will sometimes find it strange that there is not a single pillar. It turns out that these pillars are sometimes cleverly hidden inside the walls, and sometimes they are omitted as much as possible and replaced with delicate beams. In this way, the expansion of the location is quite large, and at the same time, the beauty of the entire residence is greatly increased.</p>
<p>Now, almost every kind of building material is tested by a material testing machine. Their properties and the strength they can withstand are all recorded in detail. Therefore, when planning a residence, it can be carried out very accurately, without the need for excessively large safety factors. In this way, the cost of construction will be more economical, and the waste of materials can be reduced to a minimum.</p>
<p>Multi-story residential buildings are now on the rise, but although the number of floors has increased, the height of each floor has been reduced compared to past buildings. Engineers have generally recognized that this type of low-rise building is easier to design and is also very strong. Tall floors are really not necessary, because after studying the light and volume ratios, the advantages of low-rise buildings have been proven, and there is also considerable evidence for the comfort they provide to people's spirits.</p>
<p>In addition to the above, new-style residences are also becoming more and more perfect in terms of internal equipment. The convenience of water and electricity pipe connections, and the thoroughness of disinfection designs, are now available in larger residences, with entertainment facilities, home movie theaters, or small-scale sports fields, allowing people to obtain the necessary comfort.</p>
<p>In short, modern engineers have a deeper understanding of the meaning of "residence." Modern "residences" not only solve the problem of "living" but are also gradually becoming permanent comforters of people's minds.</p>

<p>Section 6: Electric Furnace Method</p>
<p>The electric furnace method is the best steelmaking method. The steel obtained by the above methods can also be remelted by this method to achieve cleanliness.</p>
<p>The steps of smelting are divided into three steps: oxidation, reduction, and completion.</p>
<p>(1) Oxidation - During oxidation, pig iron ore and lime are placed in the furnace together. After heat radiation and high heat, the iron ore releases oxygen and undergoes oxidation, causing impurities such as silicon, magnesium, sulfur, and phosphorus to become oxides, which combine to form a black slag.</p>
<p>(2) Reduction - A mixture of five parts of lime and one part of feldspar powder semi-liquid is combined with one-fourth part of white coal to form a reducing agent, which is put into the furnace. Close off external air from entering, so that the temperature inside the furnace gradually decreases. When the steel is reduced, the slag will appear yellowish-brown, and at the same time, a calcium carbide odor will be released, which is sufficient to indicate.</p>
<p>(3) Completion - To complete the steel, it is necessary to add various useful materials, such as nickel, manganese, chromium, carbon, and tungsten.</p>
<p>In total, the time taken for the three steps is about four or five hours for each ton of steel smelted, and the electricity consumption is about 100 to 200 kilowatt-hours.</p>
<p>Therefore, although this method can obtain better steel quality and does not require other fuels, the electricity consumption is extremely high, and there is much heat waste and high electricity costs, so it is not very economical. The Shanghai Central Research Institute Steelmaking Plant has this equipment, and the Shanghai Steelmaking Plant also has a small-scale one. (End of Chapter 4)</p>
<p>Chapter 5: On Steel</p>
<p>Section 1: The advantages and disadvantages of impurities contained in steel are sufficient to affect its hardness, force, toughness, and other properties. The following describes several common substances.</p>
<p>(1) Carbon - When the carbon content in iron is 1.25%, it can enhance the force of iron. However, if it is not evenly distributed and forms granules, it will only make the iron hard but not tough, so attention must be paid.</p>
<p>The carbon content in steel is generally inconsistent. It is about 0.05% to 1.5% in mild steel, 0.15% to 0.25% in structural steel, 0.35% to 0.8% to 1.2% in medium steel, and 0.6% to 1.5% in steel for tools such as knives and saws. Knives must be strong, so more carbon is needed. For example, the steel used for safety razors has a special name called high-grade carbon steel, without which a sharp blade cannot be obtained. Structural steel only needs to be durable and strong, so not much carbon is needed.</p>
<p>(2) Silicon - The silicon content in ordinary steel is about 0.20%, while special steel is no more than 1.0% to 4.0%; the silicon content in structural steel is about 1.9%, and the silicon content in spring and automobile steel is also about 2.0%.</p>
<p>(3) Phosphorus - Steel with a high phosphorus content is brittle and does not last long, so the degree is 0.5% to 1.0%. If it exceeds this, it will be unusable. (To be continued)</p>
<h3 id="e241">Overview of the Planned Construction of an Office Building by the Beijing-Shanghai-Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways Bureau <a href="#e241" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c241" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">241</a></h3>
<p>— Dong Dayou</p>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>The Railways Bureau, in view of the high cost of rent for the current office space and the inconvenience of the location, which affects the coordination of work between various departments and makes it difficult to achieve ideal work efficiency, has proposed a plan to build its own office building to bring together all departments of the bureau in one place, so as to achieve the effect of arms and fingers. Currently, the Traffic and Police Departments are attached to the North Station, the Shanghai Hospital of the Two Railways and other departments are located in the Riverside Building on North Suzhou Road. This arrangement is only a temporary expedient. In the future, when the plan is realized, they will all be moved into the building. The following is an overview of the designed building project.</p>
<p>(1) Location</p>
<p>The new building will be located opposite the North Station, facing the southwest corner of Jielu and Baoshan Road, with an estimated area of 300 feet wide and 100 feet deep. There will be a gap behind the building, enough to park 50 cars. Since the new building is close to the North Station, the convenience of traffic will undoubtedly benefit public affairs handling and contact.</p>
<p>The construction of this building is only a part of the future station's grand plan. The station in the grand plan will be located at the intersection of Baoshan Road and Jielu. The required area will be expanded several times. The current plan includes offices, hotels, freight rooms, and all railway business equipment. This plan is based on the opinion of the Engineering Department of the Two Railways Bureau, and the construction of this office building is the beginning of the entire plan.</p>
<p>(2) Architectural Overview</p>
<p>The building is ten stories high, with twelve stories in the middle. It is 260 feet long and 60 feet deep. The exterior walls are made of artificial stone, the lower part is made of sesame stone, and the wall surface is decorated with simple Chinese-style carvings, which are solid and simple, meeting the requirements of modern architecture without losing the flavor of Chinese architecture.</p>
<p>The building is divided into a central part and two wings. The central part is wider and has three elevators. There are also escalators, toilets, information workers, and night offices, all facing north. The important offices are concentrated in the south-facing central part, but regardless of whether they face south or north, each quarter of the rooms are open to the air on all sides, so there is no darkness, and the air is very sufficient.</p>
<p>The entire building is made of reinforced concrete, the inner walls are made of hollow bricks, the corridors are paved with polished stone, and the office floors are paved with rubber blocks. Each floor also has a fire shelter for the placement of important documents and materials. Sanitary and electrical equipment is available in each department.</p>
<p>The entrance gate is located in the middle of the building, facing Jielu to the south. The hospital occupies the west, with a separate west entrance, isolated from other departments. The cafeteria, which can accommodate 300 people, is located on the tenth floor. Other facilities such as the library and telephone room are all available. The distribution of each floor is recorded below.</p>
