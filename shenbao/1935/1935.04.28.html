<p>— 恒</p>
<p>德自國社黨執政而後。歐洲各國幾莫不驚皇。羣謀所以應付之道。以是始有法國小協約之加緊團結。繼有法俄之携手法。意之協調。及至最近。則又有英法之接近。與波蘭之轉向。綜觀一年來歐局之變化得。助之多莫。甚於法。而今日德國國際地位之孤立。實爲前此所未見。其所以有如此之結果者。要爲國社黨之積極政策所使然若。欲避去此種地位之孤立。繫鈴解鈴。自當從變更政策入手。質言之。卽復返國聯。重與各國握手言歡耳唯。觀希特勒宣布徵兵制後。對內重整軍備之堅决。對外態度之强硬。可知欲於最近期內重使德國復返國聯。已爲不可能之事。亦唯如是。故於短期間內。德國此種孤立狀態。亦必繼續下去。唯長此以往。德國能否不因國際地位之孤立。而妨及國家之安全。是誠留心國際問題者値得注意之問題也。　今日歐洲之國際空氣。誠頗緊張。然歐洲國家之不惜訴諸戰爭之手段者。則尙極少也最。顯然者卽。今日之法國。雖爲對德最具恐怖心理之國家。然欲其對德卽訴以戰爭之手段彼。固無此决心也。蓋法國今日之利。莫若維持現狀。使此苟安之局。得以多保幾時。而英國則以其地位關係。亦不欲輕舉妄動。法欲取得英國之合作。於此一點大有顧及之必要。如最近國聯對於德國重整軍備一舉。雖能通過法之申請書。然其對於德國之懲戒。則僅止於一紙空文。而法俄恊定中。法國對俄不願以自動互助之條件相許。尤足見歐洲外交之幕後。實有老成持重之英國。爲之策動。英法之意旣。皆側重於現狀之維持。則其對德之方策自。仍以維護國聯以待德之復返爲得計。旣欲維護國聯矣。則英法方面爲。使和平之門不致閉絕不。論德國願意加入與否。自當留一德國可以加入之餘地故。英法今日對德之態度實。出於投鼠忌器之心理。唯其如是故。德國今日之國際地位雖。極孤立包。圍德國之外交陣綫。雖極緊密。然於德國之安全尙無大礙。</p>
<p>或曰。一九二三年時德國不付。賠欵法曾因此出兵魯爾以取償。以往事例今後。焉知法國對德不重採此等手段乎。然以我人觀之此。種觀察。要爲過慮。蓋今日之國際形勢。已大異於昔日也一則今。日之德。不能容忍法國此等行動。殊爲顯然。二則法國當日之行動。於凡爾賽和約賠數項下尙有相當之法理依據。（雖事後英人指爲非法）至於今次德國廢除　約第五部之行動。在德國方面亦持之有故。蓋此部開首第一句卽謂「爲使各國共同縮軍可能計。德國嚴格遵守以下規定之陸海空軍各項條每欵。……」是德國之縮軍。實以各國共同縮軍爲條。件今各國旣不縮軍。則於法理上德國固有重整軍備之可能也。三則和約第五部之廢棄。英法早已商妥其所爭持之點。不過欲藉國際公然承認之形式出之耳。四則英法旣欲加强國聯之力量。則其行動自不能不以國聯會章爲根據。苟非德國魯莽滅裂而出以挑釁行動。則軍事制裁之條欵自。必難以實。施五則今日之日本。方幸歐西之有事。法英行動稍有不愼。則波及全球之空前大戰勢。將無法避免。英法知其然也。故對德行動不能不採「不爲已甚」之態度。有此數因。故德今日若能復返國聯固。佳若不返國聯。則法國除與各國締結種種消極防守之條約外。亦難有更積極之行動故在此局面之下。德若能（一）不侵犯萊茵之非武裝地帶。（二）不對奧取軍事之行動。（三）不謀向東歐方面之發展。則其軍備雖復振亦不致引起戰禍。今日德國國社黨對外政策之强硬。殆爲洞識此種國際關係之故　。</p>

<p>（一）宣傳目標</p>
<p>（一）說明不識字之痛苦與識字之便利、及其對於國家社會之關係、使民衆知識字教育之重要、起而贊助本會之工作、識字者願負勸導宣傳或教人識字之責任、不識字者願受識字教育而入本會所辦之識字學校、</p>
<p>（二）使民衆知本會推行之識字教育運動、非僅爲一單純之文字教育、乃爲文字教育、常識指導、及公民訓練等三者合一之救國運動、故民衆更不可不熱烈贊助、踴躍參加、</p>
<p>（三）使民衆知現在　字之方法、分爲兩種、一爲入校補習、一爲校外補習、在第一種方法之下、本會已定自七月一日起設立識字學校二百二十所、共計一千三百二十班、（租界暫緩舉行）、強迫不識字民衆每日分批入校讀書一小時、以兩個月爲期、在第二種方法之下、本會已請上海黨政機關以命令規定所有黨員及學校學生等皆有教人識字之義務、凡確有困難情形不能入校讀書之不識字民衆、准其自覓或由本食介紹上項員充任教師，領用課本、在家補習、聽候本會於一定時間之後召集測騐、如測、及格、本會亦可授予畢業證書、</p>
<p>（四）使民衆知辦理此項識字教育必須從調查入乎、故本會將在五六月之間分派大批調查員、挨戶調查不識字民衆、以便將來因材施教、惟挨戶調查、困難頗多、尚望民衆予以協助及便利、萬不可留難或誤會、如承在口頭上廣爲宣傳、善爲勸導、本會實覺受惠不少、</p>
<p>（五）造成熱烈濃厚之讀書空氣、至少至少使民衆皆知本市於本年七月一日起即將強迫不識字民衆皆受　字教育、如有不識字民衆不知自愛、不願識宇、本會將予以罰金或勞役之處分、一年之後或淸市政府將其驅逐出境、</p>
<p>（二）識字敎育之意義</p>
<p>識字教育之意義、甚爲重大、茲撮要略述於下、（一）關於個人者　吾國不識字之人、平均在百分之八十以上、若輩不能寫信、不能記賬、不能看報、不識牆上之招貼、不懂官廳之佈告、不明世界之大勢、有眼等於無眼、痛苦實不堪言、</p>
<p>（二）關於社會者　社會進化之要素厥爲知識、而獲得智識之津梁、乃爲文字、故欲傳播知識、必先傳授文字、而欲獲得智識、必先認識文字、是以欲使社會有進步、不可不吏人人皆識字、</p>
<p>（三）關於民矣者　吾國民矣也立日低、國難嚴重、如欲復興民族、必先喚起民族意識、鼓舞民族精神、而其入手辦法、厥爲識字教育、德國人民百分之百皆識字、故其國勢能日漸強盛、吾國如果此後仍有百分之八十以上人民不識字、國難必難解除、民族必難復興、</p>
<p>（四）關於民權者　今人好談民主政治、以爲中國政治應由人民自己來主持、此其理論固甚動聽、現政府亦不反對、惟今日大多數人民不識字、併自已之姓名亦不能寫、政府如何可將政權交與人民、是以人民如欲擴大自己之民權、不可不將識字教育努力推行、從前專制政府爲欲蒙蔽人民、施行愚民政策、不使人民受教育、現在市政府爲造福民衆起見、大規模推行識字教育、人民千萬不可放過此大好之機會、</p>
<p>（五）關於民生者　吾國民生凋敝、由於生產落後、而生產落後之原因、則由於科學之不發達、今後如欲解决民生問題、則凡工業、農業、商業、交通等、皆當用科學方法、積極改進、「科學救國」之原則、已爲人人所承認、然人民如不識字、科學智識如何灌輸、故欲解决民生問題（食衣住行之問題）、不可不先推行識字敎育、</p>
<p>如上所述、識字敎育實為一切敎育之基礎、無論為國為民、皆有積極推行之必要、而況本市所擬推行之識字敎育、非僅為單純之文字敎育、文字敎育之外尙有常識指導及公民訓練、故其意義更爲重大、</p>
<p>（三）民衆入校補習辦法</p>
<p>不識字民衆入校補習、此爲本市識字教育方法之一、茲錄其要點如左、</p>
<p>（一）本市於民國二十四年七月一日起實施強迫識字教育、凡本市不識字民衆、應一律受識字教育、</p>
<p>（二）本市實施強迫識字教育、暫以一年爲期、自二十四年七月一日起、至二十五年六月三十日止、</p>
<p>（三）識字學校上課時間、由各失學民衆在調查時於規定時間內（大約兒竄與婦女在日間、成年男子在晚間）自行選定三種至六種、由各識字學校統籌指定之、家庭傭工及商店職工、應由雇主予以上課之便利、不得任意留難、</p>
<p>（四）應受識字教育之民衆、於接到識字學校入學通知後、如無故延不入學、除強令入學外、並科以二角以上五元以下之罰金、或令服兩小時以上五日以下之勞役、無故曠課者亦同、其因有故中途請假經識字學校核准者、須於指定時間內補習之、前項處罰、成年男女罰其本人、未成年者罰其家長、</p>
<p>（五）第四條之處罰、由各識字學校報告區辦事處决定後、通知公安局執行之、並按月彙報市識字教育委員會備案、</p>

<p>足球季巳成尾聲、中西兩裁判會的會員們、聞着沒事、特於昨日在申園「排彩」、雙方隊員雖多沙塲老將、但或以年事已高、或以荒廢日久、已非惜比、西人方面、祇七人到塲、不能成軍、臨時由中華會之樂秀榮陳劭等加入客串、雙方實力堪稱平均、比賽時間爲上下半時各卅分鐘、容以老勁不濟、個個殺得而紅耳赤、啼笑皆非、中華死裹逃生、造成二比二和局、裁判員鐘勇森、迷君共有五六百人、並不寂寞、</p>
<p>動員令下、西人會來勢汹汹、「卓別　」樂秀榮竟毫不留情、猛撲中華腹地、一而再、再而三、赫當本是西補名將、趁火打劫、十分英勇、幸得周家　人老心不老、幾次擋　、得」偏安　時、陣忙亂之後、朱　　團前方、瞿鴻仁像煞有介事、盤球深入、那曉得脚不從人、被陳劭安然救出、你來找往、光陰易逝、上半塲時間已去其大半矣、</p>
<p>此後西人會之唯一台柱、赫雷屢次偷壘劫營、均未成效、正在難解難分之際、孰料赫雷乘隙再入、周家騏心慌手亂、不特搶救木着、反落得仰天一交、於是赫雷輕輕一撥、遂以一比零先破中華之門、再逾五分鐘、赫雷捲土重來、張樂阻攔失足、周家騏有似驚弓之烏、凱七萊略一舉足、中華遂負二球、</p>
<p>上半時過後、中華會鑒於前鋒力量薄弱、朱璆自告舊勇、搖旗吶喊、改任先鋒、於是董小培報告活躍、一搭一檔、頗有相當「活兒一、西人陣內、一時險象叢生、會幾何時、倪孝本右角傳球、瞿鴻仁在鬥前脚跟一碰、果然馬到成功、從此中華聲勢爲之一振、</p>
<p>瞿鴻仁朱璆邵樂平先後三次猛攻、其勢甚烈、雖爲陳劭一一救出、但西人會業已受驚不小、未幾、董少培再接再厲、單人匹馬、已受驚不小、未幾、董少培再接再厲、單人匹馬、亦步亦趨、衛人右底、冷不防斜刺裹向一蹴、陳劭挽救不及、頓成二比二和局、中華方興未艾、猶錳攻不已、惜瞿鴻仁腳頭軟弱、屢失良機、時間終了、各得二球、一團和氣、歡呼而散、</p>

<p>— 美國達爾氏著　錢一勤譯</p>
<p>機械式之手續　尙餘意見數點、係關於機械式之手續、及體格之情形是也、當裁判員一人執法時、最好常能居比賽進攻之前面、在此部位、被能於其面前明察比賽中之一切、此即裁判員每逢進攻之一隊更換之際、必須迅速移動其部位、至塲地之他端、此並非不可能之事、因裁判員不久自能依時移動至塲中之主要部位、從該種部位可達任何之方向、有時一氣頗難緊隨進攻、移至塲之一端、而或居於球及進攻之後、但其不應停留於球及進攻之後、應即移至比賽進攻之前面部位、此需有強健之體格、自不待言者也、</p>
<p>身體之情形　成功之裁判員其身體健全之重要一如其本人實際比賽然、故其必常加以訓練、關於裁判員之身體情形、常就其「氣」之一方面而言、然照著者之意見則其「腿」之情形較「氣」爲要、是故裁判員之健強如其最弱之腿、若其腿不能迅速將其帶至比賽進攻之前面、則其裁判之效率自减、雖其目光一如年輕時之敏捷、但其不能遠立塲地之對過而宣判、一如其居球之前面然、其兩腿必須領導其兩眼至最易見之地位、故當其兩腿已不能爲力之時則裁判員不如决意將其用舊之口笛置諸高閣、永告休息之爲妙、</p>
<p>裁判員若以其工作爲重要、在籃球季未開始之前、應訓練其身體、至健強之狀况、被决不應從事其一季第一次之執法、而毫無準備、最好在一季開始之前、商之教練員作玩球之練習、此非特練其身、亦所以練其目、起始即執行正式之比賽且受學校之酬報者、實非善法、不如作爲練習裁判之用、在一季未開始之前、應作如是之練習與準備、</p>
<p>雙裁判制　倘本篇未能道及兩人裁判之方法、不得謂爲完全、雙軌裁判制可分兩種、想爲多數讀者之所知、在一種制度中、兩人均沿塲之邊綫進行、各屆一邊依照其所見而宣判、不問何處、在另一制度中、一人管其塲之一邊設比賽進攻移至塲中被之右面、被即移至籃下、注視向其前面來之進攻、他一人則沿其一邊而下、隨比賽進攻之後面、倘進攻之方向更換、則後者漸移至對方之籃下、而前者隨比賽進攻之後面、於是常有一人居比賽進攻之前、一人居後、著者深信此種制度較一人僅管塲之一邊而在籃下之比賽無指定人負責之另一制度爲佳、</p>
<p>富兩人僅沿塲之一邊而進退、常易使兩人同注近球之行動、在塲之固定部份無指定之人負責、常遇成同時鳴笛宣布同一動作之弊、且各人均不能决定應由何人宣判、或待他一人宣判、致兩人均將此職務及責任放棄，</p>
<p>雙軌制成功之密决、在乎兩條原則、第一、一人必常居進攻之前而迎之第二、他一人則必居進攻之後而追之、關於兩裁判員之關係、最要者、爲居進攻後面之裁判員、必須知曉及感覺、其何時不應鳴其笛是也、</p>
<p>在塲中及籃下之一人、應負在該區行動之全責、因被居最佳之部位可察、一切之動作也、此種責任既明白規定、則居進攻後面之一人、不致逼於宣判在前面塲中之一切、其實彼不能宣判因彼所立之部位、不適於觀察比賽故也、最不易明察之情、乃當一球員緊守一正欲擬籃之人、居比賽進攻前面之一裁判員所見僅合法之防衛、而居後之裁判員、則宣判拉人犯規、就其實並未犯規、在球後之人見之頗似犯規、故即宣判、其實彼不應如此、而應讓居前之裁判員居主動之部位、宣判一切、此係一困難之情形、須迨兩裁判員習於合作、方能成功、雖然、居球後之裁判員當然亦應宣判前塲之犯規、但此必係極顯著之犯規或違例、尤其當居前之同伴遠離比賽、處於難見之部位時、居後之裁判員應於宣判、僅須彼此合作練習及居後者常能慎重其鳴笛、以上之困難方得解决、</p>
<p>就各方面而論、此種制度較之兩人僅沿塲邊執法之制度、利益多端、因各人之區域旣規定、又於其區內自覺應負其責、故無須顧慮他一裁判是否將宣判犯規、亦無須顧慮其廳自嗚笛、免致遺漏之弊、此制更可免除一人工作而他一人旁觀、或一裁判員宣判佔先他一人之弊、因責任之分定、故可避免許多之鳴笛、如是獲得優良之裁判、</p>
<p>全篇結論　總而言之、此點應當明曉者、裁判員担任比賽不論比賽之結局滿意與否彼均不能辭其責、彼暫時實爲規則委員會之代表、此實對於委員會有重大之意義、因在今日常有人對該委員會之議决、欲加以批評也、</p>
<p>此種責任無時不在、且自籃球遊戲着想能使比賽獲滿意之結局、較不滿意者爲尤佳、裁判員之受批評或受擁戴不可或免、栽判員最好因自己裁判良好而獲內心之滿意、欲求滿意必須按照以上所指出之規律而執行、</p>
<p>公衆之批評一如風雨之善變、著者會記有一次比賽時、雙方原係仇敵、因爭錦標之關鍵若某隊獲勝則錦標奪得他一隊獲勝則分數相等、仍需比賽一次、故競爭異常激烈、結果可即奪標之一隊以二分之差敗北、致執行該次比賽之兩裁判員略遭責難、某報評論者認爲該兩人未能善處比賽、並造成過多之犯規、故惡劣之評論、悉加諸彼等之身上、一週後該兩隊作最後錦標之决鬥、因栽判員之壓服（該兩人係由他一城市聘來）比賽十分純潔、在此優良之比賽後、上週之某報評論者、彼會嚴厲責裁判員之執法過懸、現又指責此兩裁判員執法過於專鬥、須知不滿意之人常因欲達其私慾、喜事惡評、且批評之傳佈異當迅速、至於本乎良心之裁判、執法優良之比賽、從不事吹噓、雖然、不公平之批評、日久將如東流之水、一去不復反矣、（完）</p>

<p>— 君朋</p>
<p>武器原料　世界上沒有廢物，只有廢人，要是不會利用廢物的人，就是廢人，在我們窮小孩，玩科學把戲的時候，那裏買得起什麼科學儀器呢？竹頭，木屑，棉花，破布，都是做槍砲子彈的原料，你若遇到糕餅盒子，玻璃瓶，洋鐵罐，針，繩，墨水瓶，鐵絲一類的東西，都要保存起來，預備做將來的武器。</p>
<p>自造槍砲　我們作戰須要造槍砲，但是外國的儀器貴得很，那末，只得自己來造儀器，就是利用那些前面說過的許多廢物，沒有酒精燈嗎？用墨水瓶倣一個小小的酒精燈，沒有柔木塞嗎？拿棉花棉布包裹而成，沒有火酒嗎？只要把燒酒蒸溜就可得了，沒有玻璃麼？找幾根細竹管或臘紙管來代替，小朋友！我不過舉幾個例子，還要靠你聰明的大腦會不會利用，若自己眞的做不來，才向外面去買。</p>
<p>屢戰屢敗　科學的孩子是不怕失敗的，把戲不成功，不灰心，不怠倦，跌倒了，爬起來，再試試，非達到目的不可，失敗就是我們最偉大的老師，我們要有不屈不撓的精神，才能造成一個「科學的孩子」，若小有接觸即臨陣逃回，這决不是科學的孩子，也决不能負起創造一個「科學的中國」的使命！</p>

<p>— 涂紅霞</p>
<p>戰國時洛陽有個蘇秦，他是縱橫家，起初往說秦惠王，惠王不信，於是他不得志，回到家裏，所帶出去的衣服川資，都已化費完了，人也憔悴不堪，回到家裏，妻子，嫂子，父親，母親，都不睬他，衣服破了，妻子不肯替他縫綴，肚子餓了，嫂子不肯把他喫。</p>
<p>他覺得萬分的不快，於是發憤讀書，夜分，疲倦得要睡覺，自己拿了鐵錐刺股，血流到足上，驚醒了又讀’讀了三年書，跑到趙國去，趙王非常的信任他，拜爲宰相，做官以後回來，妻子，嫂子，父親，母親，都遠遠地趕去迎接他。</p>
<p>小朋友們，要知道：痛苦的結果，才是快樂哩！</p>
<h3 id="c200">金剛鑽 <a href="#c200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>— 眞</p>
<p>在星期日的那天，樂兒和華兒到熱鬧的街市中去買一些東西。走過一片五金店，看見要面的人拿了一根像鉛筆一般的東西在劃玻璃。一會兒，把那塊玻璃很整齊的劃下來了。</p>
<p>「哥哥，你瞧，那裏一枝鉛筆一般的東西，怎能劃破玻璃呢？」華兒是詫異的問着他的哥哥。</p>
<p>「那枝東西，是木頭做的，在頭的那一端有一粒很小的金鋼鑽。就是我們看見媽所帶在手指上的金鋼鑽戒指，不過是大一些罷了。因爲金鋼鑽是很堅硬的晶體，所以能劃破玻璃的。」樂兒是這樣地回答。</p>
<p>「金鋼鑽不是很貴的嗎？聽說媽的那隻戒指，要好幾千塊錢哩。那麼那枝劃玻璃的木棒，也要好幾十塊錢吧。是不是嗎？</p>
<p>「那是不消的，不過幾塊錢罷了，因爲那是人造的。」）</p>
<p>「咦！奇怪了！金剛鑽有人造的嗎？那麼怎樣造呢？」</p>
<p>人造的金剛鑽，和天然的沒有多大的分別。人造的金剛鑽，不過晶體小了一些。天然的形體，不十分美觀，必須經過一番琢磨的手續之後，才有美麗的光彩。人造金剛鑽的製法：用純碳（把吃的白糖燒焦）溶在融化的鐵中，投在冷水裏，鐵便突然凝結，然後再加一種化學藥品，使鐵溶解，就可得人造金剛鑽。」</p>
<p>於是華兒買了東西，很快的到家裏去試騐了。</p>

<p>姐姐對弟弟說：「此刻沒有什麼事做，我們來做一種算術遊戲，好不好？」</p>
<p>弟弟道：「很好！凡是遊戲，我都歡喜！請你說出遊戲的方法來。」</p>
<p>姐姐道：「你預備一張紙，一支鉛筆。不給我看見，你隨便去寫二位數目。」</p>
<p>弟弟連忙去寫了「三二兩個數目，說道：「我已經寫好了，以後怎麼辦呢？」</p>
<p>姐姐道「你把第一位數目乘二，再加一；加好之後，再乘五；乘好之後，再加上第二位的數目。你這樣算好之後，把答數告訴我，我就會知道你本來所寫的兩位數目。」</p>
<p>「吓！這個奇妙極了！」說着，他就這樣的算起來：</p>
<p>弟弟道：「算好了，答數是三十六，請你猜出來！」</p>
<p>姐姐不加思索，笑着答道：「你起先寫着的兩位數目，不是「三一」嗎？」</p>
<p>「哈哈！一點不錯！這是用什麽方法猜出來的呢？」</p>
<p>姐姐道：「說出方法來，平淡無奇的。我只要聽到你的答數，用心算减去五，就得了。你想，三十六减五，不是三十一嗎？」</p>
<p>弟弟再給姐姐猜了幾次，次次猜中。弟弟快活得不得了。弟弟道：「明天］我到學校裏，要給同學們去猜猜呢！」</p>

<h3 id="c204">紙鳶 <a href="#c204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>— 丁合</p>
<p>春天的犬氣，異常的舒適，春風微微地吹着，正適宜着在草地上放紙鳶，今天，同你們就來研究紙鳶：</p>
<p>（一）紙鳶爲什麼能上升？紙鳶的上升，靠着空氣的抵抗力，發出了托力，把紙鳶托上天空去，（如第　圖甲）風愈大，則托力俞愈大，紙鳶愈上升高空，風若小，發生的托力小，紙鳶便放不上去；但是紙鳶上的線（肚線），繫得合度與不合度，也能使發生的托力大小不同，線擊得太直，角度大，發生的托力太小（如第一圖乙）風在紙鳶背面發生了旋渦，於是加重紙鳶的壓力，將紙鳶的重量加重，放不上去了，可是綫繫得太傾斜，角度小，紙鳶也是放不上去的　　我們知道，紙薦的重量重於托力，决放不上去。</p>
<p>（二）紙　的製法：我們明白了紙鳶上升的原理，製紙鳶比較容易些。製紙鳶的材料：竹，桑皮紙。工具：刀，剪刀，漿糊。把竹用刀劈成篾，法意劈得粗細調勻，然後（在第二圖中）揀歡喜的樣子紮，紮成後，（如第三圖）彈上點紅水或墨汁，可以增添紙鶯的美觀。</p>
<p>我們紮的紙鳶，如果放上去後，傾斜（如第四圖），便是傾斜面重，應設法使傾斜面减輕，或者在另面（輕面）加得和重里面相等的重。</p>
<p>小朋友，看第五圖的放紙鳶是多麼的興趣呀，我們也來紮一一隻紙鳶試騐試騐。</p>
<h3 id="c205">靑蛙進醫院 <a href="#c205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>

<p>故事畫</p>
<p>小靑蛙出來遊玩，看見牛喝水，喝了很多，非常奇怪。</p>
<p>小靑蛙回去時，便學牛　樣子，把肚皮　得很大，給同伴們看見。</p>
<p>（三）不料把肚皮脹聞了！</p>
<p>（四）同伴們把小靑蛙抬到醫　裏，請醫生診治哩。</p>
<h3 id="c206">兒童銀行 <a href="#c206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>— 重樓</p>
<p>社會上有各種銀行，我現在再來提倡一種「兒童銀行」；但我提倡的這種「兒童銀行」不是爲儲蓄金錢，却是爲儲蓄智慧。</p>
<p>因爲人當幼年的時代，衣食都可仰給於父母，經濟的責任不必自己擔負，自已儘可以把自己的精神用在學業上；所以我現在提倡的「兒童銀行」，也就是爲增加小朋友們求學的力量。</p>
<p>這裏讓我把「兒童銀行」的章程，列舉兩條在下面——</p>
<p>「零存整取」；這種辦法是要小朋友們平素把他們的學識，慢慢地積存下來，等到積成一個整　，然再拿出來應用。譬如說你想做一個科學家，那麼你就把你所學得的科學常識，不間斷的交在銀行裏，十年以後，你必定可以做一個能發明的大科學家了。</p>
<p>「零存零取」，這一條是要小朋友們把他們平常所學的，隨時存起來，隨時再拿出來應用，譬加今天你在先生那裏學會了算術，你便把它存到銀行裏，等到明天家裏買東西要你算賬，你便把這籃術取出來應用。……</p>
<p>小朋友！這樣便利穩固的「兒童銀行」，你願意熱心參加做它的存戶嗎？</p>
<h3 id="c207">兒童的新生活 <a href="#c207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>— 巴玲</p>
<p>現在是新生活運動正在竭力提倡的時候，成人們固然要遵照新生活的項目，切切實實的做去。可是，兒童是未來的國家的主人翁，社會的改造者，尤其要努力的實行新生活，照我的意見看來，兒童的新生活，至少要做到卜面變件事，那才稱是一個新兒童：</p>
<p>（一）每天早起，刷牙，深呼吸，和柔軟體操。</p>
<p>（二）准時到校讀書，見先生同學，有相當的禮貌。</p>
<p>（三）上課時，專心聽講：考試時，不舞弊。</p>
<p>（四）食必細嚼，飲後散步半小時，不作劇烈的運動。</p>
<p>（五）書籍物件，必整理淸楚，勿凌亂勿弄壞。</p>
<p>（六）在家能幫助父母，做能夠做的事。</p>
<p>（七）和兄弟姊妹勿爭吵，處處以禮讓爲行爲的表示。</p>
<p>（八）不染惡嗜好，對於烟呀，賭呀，要認爲害人的惡魔，立志不與接近。</p>
<p>（九）要隨時隨地，設法幫助別人。</p>
<p>（十）衣服須常換，身體要時常沐浴·</p>
<h3 id="c208">微菌的撲滅 <a href="#c208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>— 任潮軍</p>
<p>微菌是一種可怕的微生物，倘使它跑到了肺部，就會發生各種疾病。它的蹤跡到處都有—無論空氣裏器具上，或者衣服上。</p>
<p>的確，微菌欲達到我們的身體內部是不容易的。倘使從鼻腔鑽入，有鼻毛把它格住，假如給它衝過了，那末氣管內壁的氈　會捉住它。從口腔進去呢？這樣口腔內的唾液能阻止它的繁殖。假如留在鼻孔，口腔及氣管內，那裏的粘膜很不適宜它的生殖。至於它從破皮膚進去，內部有白血球把它殺死，但是這僅限於康健者，它對於身體衰弱者，仍能深達其內部，所以我們應康健我們的體格，及撲滅附近的細菌。</p>
<p>關於撲滅的方法：一，以熱石灰和水溶合，刷壁，及傾入水湯及廁所內。二，以蟻醛氣體殺房中微菌。三，消滅它的媒介物——蠅和蚊。四，以沸水煮殺衣上微菌。其餘如飲沸水，房間應有多量日光晒入，吸新鮮空氣等。</p>
<p>小朋友。現在是春天，正是它們繁殖時期。我們應該急速撲滅，免得夏天種種傳染病的發生。</p>

<p>— 心靑</p>
<p>在我以爲緩緩地死在那黑暗的壙中，似乎比一切命運都惡。我想，任是供給比那些野人故一餐飯吃，也及不上這一半兒的不幸。</p>
<p>那日子來了，伊得放到那山頂的壙中去，照定例，伊是穿着那最好的衣服，戴着珍貴的實石，可是我是當地這麼一個大人物，那王和后以及一大羣人都到壙口來瞧我們的結局，</p>
<p>吾妻的屍體先放下去，接着他們放在一隻沒有蓋的箱中，裏面放着一壺水和幾個小面包。於是我也放將下去，將墳口閉塞住了。</p>
<p>我向四面瞧時，見我是在一種大山洞中，足有一百碼深。死人所有珍貴的寶石和美麗的衣服，地上到處都是，四下　裏又有死人的白骨。</p>
<p>我坐在地上哭着，想我的性命竟這樣的完畢了。我想先前要是在海上風浪中喪了命，那也和這般奇怪的死一樣的。</p>
<p>然而耗費時間在這樣的思想上，於我也沒有用了，所以我就吃了一個麵包，在壺中喝了水。如此我在壙中好好的守過了幾天，諸位聽下去，便知我力自求生正是一件好事情啊。</p>
<p>一天我聽得一個聲音，似乎有甚麼生物正在行動着。我便向那聲音來的所在走去，到得我走近時，那東西却逃跑了。我仍是前去，不一會便瞧見一點微光像一顆明星般在那裏發光，</p>
<p>我不住的前進，末了，試想我何等的快樂，—我發見那光是從岩石上一個大窟窿裏透進來的。我走出這窟窿時，見是通往海濱的。我所聽得的聲音，原來是一頭畜生，每天自海中出來，穿過了那岩石上的窟窿，到山洞裏來吃死人。</p>
<p>我既斷定了我在這所在是很安全的，便跪在海邊謝上帝佑我，我既休息了一會，就回到山洞中去，取那留下的飲食。在那邊我便取了最好的寶石和可以找到的食料，於是仍回到海　去。</p>

<p>— 沉湮</p>
<p>在眞正的封建社會下，女子完全是成家庭的奴棘，她的生計，是「幼從父，長從夫，夫死從子」她的生死權，全操在這幾個人手裏，與社會沒有直接關係。可是外來資本主義的巨磚，打破了我們破敗的落後的鬥帘以來，農村破產了，大家庭制度崩潰了。一年年的內憂外患，巳應了十室九空的諺語，所以雖然一方在提倡賢妻良母，勸「娜拉」回家，但十室九室之家，本爲女子生從死依的父，夫，或子，類都被摒棄生產綫外了。在這種情形下，女子爲求活命計，不得不走向社會。</p>
<p>另一方廠家或商家，他們爲的是謀利，於是廠家倒是樂用　　　可以低廉，而又比男工耐勞柔順的女子——過去只配做家庭奴隸的女子。　　　　　川女店員，如上述的條件以外，更利用女子的姿色做活招牌，以資吸收購買　　　　各國已有先例。中國也正走上這條路線。這裏成爲問題的，便是男女職　上的爭奪　　據本月二十日中日報，載着一段廣州酒樓茶室招待，男女職業衝突的消息：大”是：一廣州市酒樓茶室工會，日前以市內酒樓茶室，間有僱用女侍，認爲攙奪工作，影響會昌生計，呈請政府禁止。致引起婦女協會注意，發生爭議。據婦女協會彭女士稱：「婦女解放，係以謀得教育平等，和經濟獨立爲目的，經濟獨立，則以職業爲前提，凡社會上男子能够充操作的職業，女子都有充任的可能，歐美各國，對於婦女職業，絕無限制，本省女權運動，正在萌茅時期，婦女職業，亦漸漸澎漲，如機關之公務員，學校教師，醫院之醫生護士，娛樂塲之帶位員……均有婦女充任。在稍明世界潮流之人，均應提倡婦女職業，以謀夫婦間之互助。該酒樓茶室工會，對於僱用女侍，認爲獲奪工作，似係不明女權運動之趨勢。……同是人類，祇問其有無擔任該項職務之技能，不能因其性別而有所軒輊。查先總理主張男女平等，扶植女權，黨綱經有明白規定。本會爲各界婦女領導機關，對於此事，認爲妨碍婦女職業之發展，將於日內據理力爭，以維女權」。而工整委方面，說；「酒樓茶室工人，失業者已達五六千人之多，女招待則憑其色以迎合顧客之心理，對於酒樓茶室工作，無專鬥技能，又無業務之經騐，僅爲營利者利用社會弱點，招徠顧客。其結果祗有蹂躪女性，形成社會不安寗，其實提倡女子職業問題，其業務須加考慮，孰適宜於婦女操作，孰能使女子隋落，此問題至爲重要。故本會對此次反對女招待目的，非壓仰女權發展，其直接實爲保障本業工友職業安全，間接即爲提高婦女地位，純係具有道德性。」所以他們呈請黨政五機關的呈文中更有很妙的詞句。例如「當此提倡舊道德，挽救頹風之際。斷不容狡黠商人，祇圖個人利益，形成畸形發展狀態，惹起社會糾紛也。」</p>
<p>讀了上面的幾段談話，以及呈文的斷片，大有公說公有理，婆說婆有理，都是名正言順的，至於將來的勝利究竟誰屬，現在尙不敢預言，不過年來復古的空氣彌漫廣東；工會方面，抓住當局提倡舊道德心理，也許再會奉到一個禁令，可暫時得到勝利吧？不過不景氣的空氣日甚一日，商家除息業關門以外，他們要掙扎，只有尋取有利可圖的途徑任你禁令重重，有時也會顧不得，偷偷地試行。按廣東的禁止酒樓茶室雇女招待，早巳有過明令。而現在又重復錄用女招待已是明證。表面上看去，最後的勝利，似乎終會屬於婦協會。可是這裏不得不爲女權運動者進一言的，便是這種爭議，當作反復古運動是可以的，至於婦運的終極，决不是僅向男子爭奪職業。而是應在整個社會的經濟問題上去着想，求得眞正的男女平等。</p>

<h3 id="c226">第二節封建的家庭婦女與結婚 <a href="#c226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>— 君慧</p>
<p>建築在農奴勞動上面的封建國家，必然是領主，貴族，佾侶，官僚們的議事機關。他們爲着掠奪隣國的財富，爲着鎮壓農奴的叛亂，更爲着合法的無限制的榨取農民大衆，賦與了國家機關以絕對的專制權力，而這權力的行使者便是領主。可是，領主爲行使其專制權，就需要某種法制的道德的秩序，於是乎發生了封建的成文法及道德律。這種法律自然是以絕對的隸屬關係爲前提。換言之在成人間，男女間，親子間，長幼問都有一定的法制的道德的從屬關係。其中最典型的特徵表現就是封建的身分制度及男子壓迫婦女的封建的道德律。</p>
<p>身分制度是封建國家用法律來規定社會各階層人民的地位的東西。例如領主，貴族，儈侶，商工市民的農奴等都有一定的社會的身分，同時有一定的由上而下的支配關係，在他們問，家族的，宗教的，道德的，教育的一切社會生活都有儼然的區別。暨方說，一個商人不得坐貴族所坐的椅子，不得受貴族所受的教育，更不得和責族通婚。在這種制度之下，社會各階級的家族生活及結婚形式自然有天淵之差別。我想在這裏，關於領主，農民及商工市民的婦女生活加以簡單的叙述。</p>
<p>首先，領主家庭是充分的反映出他的社會地位的特質。領主爲維持對其臣屬及領民的權力，就需要加强他的家長樣威。他對於家族握着生殺與奪之權，將自己的子女轉化於財產，轉化於非人格的物件。可是以戰爭和掠奪爲經常工作的領主，不得不把家政委任於最可信賴的妻，這樣領主的妻是以主婦的資格去管理生產上的組織，租稅的徵收，糧食的貯藏等各種家政。這種主婦的權利對於農奴可以實行苛酷的榨取，更可以執行不客氣的懲罰。但是她對於丈夫即領主，則處於對農奴一樣的非人的地位。</p>
<p>領主家族的婚姻是徹頭徹尾以家庭的利益爲前提，詳言之領主及貴族間之結婚是以政治經濟爲目的的一種契約，爲着締結鞏固的同盟，爲着增進定庭的經濟力，更爲着保證軍事上的安全，無妨把自己的幼女嫁給近隣的老領主。個人的愛情及願望是不得不犧牲於家庭利益的大前提之下的。昂格斯說：</p>
<p>『在貴族及騎士看來，也和有統治權的王侯一樣，結婚是政治的行爲，也就是藉結婚之助而要擴大自己權力的交易。决定的條件是王朝的利益及家鬥的利益，决不是個人的希望。』</p>
<p>這種政略的結婚引起了早婚的惡習。在中世紀歐洲的貴族家庭間盛行早年的婚約。一位伯爵夫人是把自己的幼女和日耳曼公家的相續者伯爾特締結婚約，而新郎新婦還不到六歲。這種惡習在目前我國也時常可以看到的。</p>
<p>其次，農民家庭的婦女是農奴同樣參加一切生產勞動，但封建的男尊女卑的道德的觀念也支配他們的生活，農婦更成爲農奴的農奴了。不過，他們的結婚及家族關係常常爲領主所直接支配。領主是把農奴們間的結婚看做增大屬於自己的勞動力的手段。在這種利益的打算上，要直接處置他們的結婚。謝西夸夫說：</p>
<p>『他們（領主）把農民的結婚看做生育子女而招致領主的利益的馬和犬的交尾一樣。』</p>
<p>這樣，領主是將十八以上的農夫和十四歲以上的農女，可以執行强制結婚。因爲他們痛切的感到農奴的數的增大就是他們的利益的增大的原故。並且封建法律不單給領主以隨意處分農民的勞動和財產之權利，甚至給他以廣泛的性的强迫的可能性。這點，想在「初夜權」一節中加以詳述。</p>
<p>最後，工商市民的家庭就是現代資產階級家庭的前身。在中世紀封鎖的自然經濟時代，在領主居住的都城之下，爲着供給領主的需要而發生了手工業及商業的專鬥的職業者。他們雖然同農奴一樣處於領主的支配之下，但他們的生活樣式已經採取進步的形態。關於他們的家族形態及婦女地位，打算在第六講中加以詳細的叙述。在此因篇幅關係不能作進一步的說明。</p>
<h3 id="c227">觀演武松後 <a href="#c227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>— 碧遙</p>
<p>十年不看舊戲了，上星期六晚上，因了朋友的邀請，踏進了某舞台。其時台上紅白藍黑的臉兒，拖着長長的野雞毛，在鄧兒穿來穿去，心知他們是在鬧着甚麼職爭，便閉着眼想猜古昔粗野的生活狀况。</p>
<p>一會兒台上搬出了武松，頓時看客們熱鬧地喝彩起來，長陽崗打過老虎的好漢，到現在還有這般的魔力！可是看下去方知道：喝彩最多的不是打虎的一塲，而是武松吿發潘金蓮的對他調情和後來斬殺潘金蓮的時候。這似乎證明了潘金蓮比吃人的老虎還更討人嫌，而武松之所以爲英雄，尤在乎他能硬帮帮的殺卻一迷人的淫婦。觀衆的心理，果眞這般不可解嗎？</p>
<p>平心而論：妖艷的少女潘金蓮，被配上又醜又蠢的丈夫，她便向武松調情，和西門慶通姦，都不是大了不得的事。至於後來的毒殺武大郎，那祇是社會環境，逼得她使然。然而她卻不幸遇着了爲虛名而矯情的武松，始而將隱事和盤向武大郎吿發，繼而一刀叫潘金蓮身首異處，終而因水滸傳描寫民族英雄的苦心，她便作了武松的陪襯，而成為千載淫婦的典型。這些封肆社會的往事，還有甚麼可說呢？</p>
<p>只是，年來封建思想，巳被人翻得古井重波；婦女在今日，由鄉村以至通都大邑，死於這上面的日不知幾何。同時姦殺，殺妻的慘劇，層出不窮；而厦門地方，竟有吿發女兒通姦，以致女兒蹈海而死的親父！這些英雄好漢，都可以配入武松的祠堂；可是這祠堂香火若盛，女人將無遺類，是很明白的。</p>
<p>藝術，以其所包藏的思想來影響社會，力量之大，當然超出法令以上。武松一劇，對於潘金蓮的妖冶淫蕩，與夫武松的糾糾不凡，描爲得特別着力，觀衆的情感已被牠捉住，除了隨劇情的是非以爲是非之外，還能想些甚麼？記得兩年前看「怒吼罷，中！」那時台下喝彩的盛况，遠非現在武松的塲面可比。當時演至許多男女工人向帝國主義者死拼時，看客簡直是一片嘶啞的哭聲。那種熱烈的偉大的義憤，怎麼說也該是高出於武松殺嫂的。</p>
<p>然而包藏封建意識的像「武松」一類的舊戲，隨時隨地演着，而像「怒吼罷，中國！」一類足以激起民族鬥爭的情緒的新戲，卻如鳳毛麟角，百不一見，不大可怪嗎？感人最深的舞台藝術，閉住了解放的一面，而僅有封建意識的舊戲在那兒跳梁；當此死人作怪的今日，看客們日夕浸沉於此陳年的花雕，怎得不更醉眼朦朧呢？</p>

<p>— 蕪</p>
<p>本月十九日大版朝日新聞載：日本雇主選擇女傭的標準。大都歡喜高小畢業，身體康健，性情和靄，有確實的保證人等。此外如巳做過女招待或女工的，高小沒有畢業的，身體瘦弱的，有家庭負擔的等等都爲雇主所厭惡的，尢其以中學畢業的，最爲雇主所摒棄。原因則爲一經中學畢業，未免志高氣昂，做雇主的不容易駕馭她。</p>
<p>由這一段新聞，我們可以看出日本女子生活的困難了。日本的義務教育年限爲六年，加上中學四年，一個女子當中學畢業巳讀書十年了。然而中學畢業只好當用人！做用人總不是她們樂意的，可是無路可走，只能去做用人。奈何雇主們又如此的苛刻。這眞是日本知識婦女的末路窮途啊！</p>

<p>六月十二日</p>
<p>春天，那可愛的春天是早巳過去了。在那快活的春天裏，有人快活，有人苦痛；有些人是在天堂，有些人是在牢獄。有人是自由的，有些人竟是奴隸。我是在牢獄中，且當着奴隸，而過了那別人快活的春天，不，大凡女人們都是和我同樣的。還有比我更不如的那些找不着飯吃的女人！</p>
<p>孩子天天呱呱地哭着，張開嘴找尋奶吃，她要活，要成長。她還不意識到自己將要成長到一個不幸的女人！</p>
<p>六月十三日</p>
<p>這幾天我自己沒有了乳汁，奶姆又繁蹩扭扭地僱不好，孩子病了。還聽說×長要叫我們這幾天就出醫院，搬到新租的房子裏去呢：總算醫生吿訴他。我我和孩子身體都不好，目前出院是有生命危險的，×長才不打發人來催我們出去。</p>
<p>在這種社會裏，女人是屬於男人的，孩子是屬於父母的。被男人棄了的女人便沒有地方去，父母不管的孩子，便不能長成！</p>
<p>我記得曾經聽見有人說過一個故事，說是在有一種社會裏，女人不靠男人可以在社會裏生活，簪社會做事；要戀愛的話也隨時有她的自由。沒有父母的孩子，也有國家機關撫領，把他們教養成人。但我聽的是故事，也有人說這是事實，不過我想着空論如何這是有道理的，大家都應該這樣去辦。據我自前看見的這些什麼慈善堂，嬰兒院，都是沒有用的，不能活的女人和流浪死亡的孩子每年何止千萬？</p>
<p>六月十七日</p>
<p>這幾夜我都在夢想着：夢見我非常的自由，我跑到個機關裏去，把我平時所會做的事情都做給那機關的人看，他們非常歡迎我，說是要把我的孩子送到一個非常好的寄養所去，叫我就在那裏替他們做工作，他們每月給我薪金；我還可以在休息的時刻去看我的孩子，拿我所賺的錢簪她買玩具，買糖果。當我做着這樣的夢的時候，我總是被一奇怪的聲音擾醒，原來是孩子在我身旁啼哭。</p>
<p>現在我是病着，病得幾乎不能動；但是假如我所夢見的那天國是眞正的能被人創造的話，我就是病着也要起來去參加創造的，即使我爲着工作而死了的話，使後來的女人幸福也是好的！</p>
<p>六月十九日</p>
<p>昨天我因爲體溫太高，把我所想的都糊裏糊塗的說了出來。醫生因此說我神經有些變態，我覺得我沒有失常，不過事情想得太遠了。我所認爲對的，人家說是瘋狂。不，只是男人認爲是瘋狂罷了。許多女人都沒存說過我這是瘋狂的思想！</p>
<p>今天的日記沒有寫完，醫生打發人來要收去我的筆了。他硬說我神經已經發生異常的變化，要叫我毫不用思想的養息！</p>
<p>好吧！你們收了我的筆去，算是你們勝利了。反正是你們的世界，在別人的世界裏活都不得痛快的。日記當然是更不能寫了。現在沒有別的，就是我好好地靜養，養好了病，再來和你們算賬！算好了賬之後，我再也不當病人，也不當姨太太！（完）</p>

<p>婦女傘剛才從飛千年來的重壓下竭力探出一點頭來，只這一點點剛在成長的嫩芽還在搖拽不定的時候，是需要加倍的培養與維護，絕對不能允許任何，假着婦女運動之名，而實際則在摧殘婦女運動的成長，加增婦女前途的障碍。</p>
<p>放開眼來着，東也一本婦女雜誌，西也一張婦女刊物，似乎婦女運動眞的蓬勃起來了，婦女刊物一天天在增多起來了；但是，慢點快活，大家得先來檢查一遍。</p>
<p>印着一個千嬌百媚的女人放大照相的封面，裏面是呌女人怎樣塗胭脂，修指甲，叫女人怎樣去嬌媚，又告示女人該買那幾種外國牌子的名貴香水，其他是女人的半裸體圖畫，外國明星的照片，又有幾篇用一種「不中不西」的筆調，寫的專備男子玩樂的肉感的小說，和些叫中國女性追上歐美摩登小姐尾巴的論文，這算是呌女子做「摩登玩物」的刊物。還有：每週的婦女期刋，附在報紙上的婦女週刊，及零碎關於女子的文字……等等，大概不外是：什麼菜怎樣怎樣燒法和吃法，對丈夫怎樣的馴良討好法，什麼「御夫術」，「新女誡」等，教虫人在家時做一個古代的女子，被丈夫帶她出外時，衣飾上，態度上必得是一個摩登女子，那末丈夫臉上有光輝，不然是傷丈夫的面子的。可惜他還沒有說，女人最好成爲一架「百靈機器」，叫她變成什麼，就成什麼，那丈夫才眞的喜歡呢！有些則把女子儘情嘲駡，女人是禍水啦，女人不爭氣自己軟弱啦，女人生來賤啦，迷信啦，似乎女人眞是給他說得狗也不要吃的賤骨頭了，好在女子從不理會外界的事，雖被駡得痛快淋漓，沒有人來駁斥的。有的呢，則指出婦女運動的最終路途和女子的職業是「嫁」，把「賢德」這把鎖仍給帶上……五光十色，這些都是假婦女之名的，而共實對婦女毫無益處的，同時對那些意志尙未堅定而在苦難中掙扎着的女性，無異是一種麻醉和欺騙的鬼蜮技倆。</p>
<p>我們看到每天的報紙，上載着：受男子的欺侮，社會的壓榨，而轉輾流浪困苦死亡的婦女伺可勝數！婦女爲了幾千年來的不平等待遇，脆弱到了極點了，只能任人宰殺，給人蹂躪。現在似乎已暴露了一點嫩苗，怎能坐視人家放出塗着毒汁的暗箭，而不顧呢？</p>

<p>— 余林</p>
<p>在我的故鄕共有兩　　裏農：一種呌做零工夫，卽是在平時並不幫人作工，只有在農忙時候才被人請去做事情的農人：另一種名呌長年，卽是整年住在地主家裏，從早到晚地爲地主工作的農民。但是，做零工夫的多半是自己還有一點土地的農人，他們的幫人做活，都是從自己百忙的工作中抽出時間去作的；長年則不然，他們自己沒有土地，沒有房產，所有的只是一付健壯的身體，一身驚人的力氣，他們是整月整年地在爲人工作的。所以，嚴格說來，可以稱爲百分之百的雇農的，只有長年，零工夫還不能算在數內。</p>
<p>本來，整年整月住在別人家裏爲別人工作的，還有二把手和放牛匠。但一把手是幇助大長年的，不是正角色，只可說是配角；放牛匠只是十三四歲的孩子，其主要工作只在放牛喂猪和別的零碎事情，可以說是「吼班」；而且，二把手和放牛匠旣是整月整年地在爲人做活，當然也可說是長年了。所以，長年實是雇農的代表，只要知道長年的生活情形，便可以想像到一般雇農，如二把手和放牛匠等的一切了。</p>
<p>長年們的工作，都是在上一年的舊曆臘月定好了的。所以每一個長年二娃（因爲他們的社會地位很低，所以一般人便在「長年」二字下面加上「二娃」的頭銜，稱他們做「長年二娃」，以表示其與「老太爺」「大先生「等的區別）到了臘月時，都要跑到鄉村的市鎭上去「活動」，借着請地主們喝二兩燒酒，借着他們的力氣，借着他們樸實老誠的「天性」，去取得來年的「活路」（卽工作之意）。如果來年的活路弄好了，那他們一年的生活便算有了「保障」，不致有餓飯的危險；倘使不幸，到舊曆臘月三十日都還沒有定好來年的活路，那便要遭到可怕的失業危險，不知道怎樣度過來年一年的生活了。因此我們可以說長年二娃的命運是在每牟的臘月裏决定的。</p>
<p>現在我們故鄉的長年，每年的工資大槪是二百多千銅錢。這如果是在上海，工百多千銅錢也可合銀幣百元左右；長年是終年住在地主家裏喫地主的飯的；如果一年有百元左右的收入，又不要祖負房錢和伙食費，那總算是很可以過活的了。但是，我們故鄕的銀幣價格之高簡直不是安坐在上海的人所能想像得到的、銀幣一元在那裏要換二十多千銅錢，所以每年有工資二百多千銅錢的長年，實際上每年只有十元左右的收入，卽使他們不担負房錢和伙食費，沒有家庭負担，一年十元錢也是不够用的。</p>
<p>「日出而作，日落而息，鑿井而飲，耕田而食。」據說這乃是古代農民快樂之所在。但是，現在我們故鄕的長年二娃，却並沒有什麽快樂，在平常時候，他們是天則亮時就起來工作，除了　飯而外，一天到晚都在野外做活；一到播　豆類的時節，那他們在　鳴時就要起來，喚罷早飯後就得出去耕種，這時太陽還沒有出來呢！在秋收期間。他們當然更忙，更苦，這時候雖然已屆秋天，但太陽還是火一般的厲害，天氣有時候甚至比夏天還要熱。長年二娃在這酷熱的天氣中的工作是挑水榖子，卽是由許多農民在水田裏把稻打落在一個大的木桶裏後，用籮兜一挑一挑裝起來。由長年二娃挑回地主家裏去。這種水榖子每挑也不能說很重，但也不能說很輕，大概每挑有兩百斤左右。長年二娃的氣力當然比你我的大得多，所以他們能終日挑着兩百斤左右的水穀子，滿不在乎。爲了要活潑他們的身體，買活他們的心，地主們於這時特別給他們準備了頂好的燒酒和一些猪耳朵猪舌頭之類的下酒菜，大槪每在他們挑了兩三挑水穀子回來之後，就可以飮三杯頭冒燒酒。如果要說快樂的話，那恐怕就是在於他們這時有燒酒和猪耳朶喫吧，因爲這些東西是他們平時所不易得到的。</p>
<p>不過我們也不應該過分輕視長年二娃，他和你一樣，有血，有肉，有感情，而且，不管你相信不相信，他們也會講戀愛哩！說來是很有趣的，在我們故鄉，一般地主們除了想多土地多福壽外，還想多子孫。他們只要有了一個兒子，馬上就想抱孫兒；只要他們的兒子有了十二三歲，就要想法給他娶個十七八歲乃至二十幾歲的大姑娘來，一方面是想早點抱孫兒，一方面是想家裏多一個人好供自己使喚！這的確是兩得其便的。所謂「早婚制度」，就是如此形成的。這種早婚制度對於長年二娃頗有一些好處，因爲十七八歲的大姑娘作了十二三歲小孩子的老婆當然不滿意，不滿意就要另尋出路，另尋出路的結果筋强力壯的長年二娃就成爲了如意郞君。於是並不配講戀愛的長年二娃也就大講其戀愛了。同時，地主們的女兒，是從小到大關在家裏，不准與男人接近的；但正因其不能與男子接近，所以只要有機會接近到男子時，就易發生問題。長年二娃常出入於地主之門，比較地可能接近地主們的小姐，一接近就易發生戀愛問題；據說地主們的女兒十有六七是和長年二娃講戀愛的！但是，我們的故鄕很封建，假使長年二娃和某一姓閨閣小姐發生了戀愛，一經發覺，那這一姓的人就都要起來把那長年二娃置於死地，至少也要打斷他的背脊骨，使他永遠成爲廢人！至於與他們的媳婦講戀愛，那便不能一概而論了，因爲媳婦是他姓出的，就是與長年二娃講戀愛，也只是敗壞他姓的門風，與自己無關，而且、我們故鄕的地主們的功利主義還講得非常澈底，在他們想來，長年二娃與出自他姓的媳婦發生戀愛，所生的孩子　仍是自己兒子的兒子，仍是自己的孫兒，絕不會被長年二娃抱了去。所以，有些地主在他的兒子尙在無能爲力的時候，爲了要早抱孫兒，對於長年二娃與媳婦講戀愛的事，總是裝啞作聾的！</p>

<p>象是現在陸地上最大而又値錢的動物。在中國，除雲南有一個地方產象外，別地方實在不易多見；但在非洲和印度象却是像豬那麽衆多，無論在鄉村，田野或是街上都可以看得見的。</p>
<p>非洲象的形狀和印度的稍有不同，因之捕象的方法也不一樣。非洲象的耳朶很大，象牙也長，但性子非常的兇猛；捕捉的人往往一不小心給牠的鼻子往上一蹺就送了性命。印度象的耳朵小到祇有一柄蒲扇那麼大，性子很柔馴，捕捉時可不必費多大的工夫就可以到手；而且這種象捕來了差不多完全是活的，可當做家畜豢養。</p>
<p>印度捕象的方法大旣有二種。第一種祇適用於象交尾的時期；他們把訓服過的牝象帶到產野象的地方，拿着一根很粗的棕繩牢牢地縛信牝象的四足，繩子的長度僅够牠在固定範國以內　着四方步子。另外再在這牝象的四周掘下許多陷坑，坑上滿鋪樹葉和打着活結的棕繩。把這樣的疑陣佈置妥當之後，捕象的人就很敏捷的藏在樹林裏，以避免野象的視綫。</p>
<p>一會兒，野象便從遠遠地三五成羣的或者單個的走來，滿以爲站在這裏的牝象是牠的伴侶，，等到見到是牝象，那就簡直如急色兒見了蕩婦般的汛急地衝到牠身邊，在牠周圍兜着圈子，做出種種輕狂的醜態，和牠勾搭起來。在這得意忘形的當兒，捕象的人便從樹林裏朝天開槍，「拍」的一聲，嚇得野象驚惶失措的跳了起來，一個不小心，脚便踹到</p>

<h3 id="c233">談堅忍 <a href="#c233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<p>— 李愛亭</p>
<p>拿破崙說：勝利往往是屬於最有堅忍心的人的？高爾司密斯說：我們最偉大的光榮，並不是在保持永遠的不失敗，而是在每次失敗之後的復能上升。愛特生博士說：堅忍是有十九次的失敗，而到了第二十次方才成功。這是再正確也沒有的事實，就是徜若人生而沒有堅忍的精神，要想和環境作戰，要想克服種種的困難而底於成功，那就無異於緣木求魚他的不會有所成就，是任何人所不能否認的。</p>
<p>這也是事實，一個人對於他所從事的事業，往往想使其成功而終是像有惡魔在從中搗亂似的，不但沒有成功的希望，而月反致一敗塗埤，因此不期然而然的使從事者心灰意懶，一蹶不振。其實，在這種經過一番努力而失敗之後，本巳孕育有成功的原質，也就是說，假如你能冉犧性一下，再努力一下的話，那成功就會立刻站在你的面前，再也沒有隱藏的餘地。所以一般的說起來，失敗實是由於缺乏一種堅忍的精神所　。然而堅忍　　是　件什麽東西呢？我們不妨來下一個定義。就是所謂堅忍並不是一種沒有方針而隨意做去的盲目的努力，而是把目的，志願和熱心三個東西化合而成的一種力量。因爲人有了目的，方能集中他的力量致力於某種事業；有了志願，對於他的計劃方能有一種保持的力量發生出來；有了熱心，方能集中精力去打敗種種自然或人爲的障碍。這三個條件，彼此都有連帶的關係，絕對不允許任意分離開來。可是社會上一般從事於事業的人，尤其是初入社會的燥進的靑年，往往忽略了這一點，以致一遇困難，就喪失了邁進的精神，甚至半途而廢，終於一無所成，這實在是很可惜的。同時，事實告訴我們；堅忍的用處，不僅在人生某一個時期，或者對於某一種事物方面方才需要牠，而是在任何方面，都有需要這種精神的必要。因爲人的一生，正也同那戰塲一樣，內心的衝動，境遇的優劣等等，往往會激發出種種劇烈的意志方面的爭鬥，這時倘能以堅忍來激刺他的腦筋，使他分明正邪善惡，那他就不致陷入墮落的深　裏去了。</p>
<p>在古今的史冊中，不知有多少成功的偉人，他們的成功從不依賴於機緣，捷徑，或者佳運，而大半得力於堅忍的精神。這裏，我們可以舉出兩個例子來證明這話的不虛偽。寫香客旅行記Pilgrim'sProgress的彭揚，該是大家知道的吧！他的寫成這書，是用牛乳瓶上的封皮紙寫成的。又如近代的大來，他的能够成爲今日爲人共曉的輪船業中的巨擘，起初也僅是從一艘小輪船做起的。記得密而頓曾經很透澈的說：名人所遭遇的環境，以拂逆者居多；而他之能打開一條成功之路。往往要經過許多抗拒和障碍，所以人能由其所得的材料之中，勉力底於成功，實爲莫大的能事。不但前人如此，就是目前各國爲人所崇敬，或者爲人所側目的人，在他們的成功之中，也决不會沒有堅忍這兩個字的。</p>
<p>總之，堅忍是成功的階梯，假如缺乏了這種堅忍的毅力，那末成功將永遠不能獲得，而且反將永遠陷入於眞正失敗的氛圍之中。於此，我們更可意味到那失敗爲成功之母，有志者事竟成等等名訓，並不是無聊的口號，而是含有相當的值的。</p>

<p>活結裏面，跳得愈凶、脚上的繩子也縛得愈緊，到後來連一動也不能動地站着，垂頭喪氣的等待捕象的人來處置了。</p>
<p>野象被捉到了三日之內，捕象的人也不和牠見面，並且還不把食物給牠吃；等到過了大約一禮拜的光景，捕象的人才帶了食物站在遠處朝牠那裏投着，不過這時不再怕牠看兒了。這樣過了三個月以後，野象的性子漸漸地馴服了，於是才把四脚上的繩子解開，帶回家當做家畜豢養了。</p>
<p>第二種捕象的方法，是隨時隨地都可以應用，雖所費的費本比第一種要多，但收效却比前者大得多。用這種方法捕象時，事前先要往各處尋找象的踪跡，如過一羣的野象聚在一起，便趕緊把所畜的家象在牠頸上繫一根長繩，驅到野象羣裏去活動：捕象的人遠遠地躱着，等到家象在野象隊裏混熟了以後，才把長繩的一端緩緩地朝自己身邊拉着，那隻家象便自然地依着繩子的方向走來，同時，那一羣野象也就跟着來了。</p>
<p>在這羣象走來的路上，到處都洒滿了菓子和別種食物；於是一羣野象不知不覺地祗顧吃着地上的菜子信步的走來。這時捕象的人便把這隻馴服的家象牽進一塊圍繞着木柵的塲子裏，野象也茫然地跟着牠進來；接着，捕象的人就用着很敏捷的方法把木柵門關上，使進去的野象再也不能退出來了。然後，也照上述的方法，使一羣野象挨餓一個禮拜之後，才遠遠地投食物過去給牠們吃；經過三四個月的時間，這羣野象也就變成家象了。</p>
<p>但在菲洲，捕象如要話捉的話，那却是很困難的，因爲非洲的象性子非常的兇暴，要想馴服牠的確不是一　容易的事情，所以非洲的捕象人往往見了象就用搶射殺，然後再來取牠的牙齒。</p>
<p>但是，象在非洲雖很多，要想把牠繁殖起來却不甚容易；如果天天不斷地射殺牠們，將來怕會有絕種的一天。就是一般靠捕象過活的非洲臘人，現在也想到了這一點，因此大家議定了一種規則，大意是：「每人每年不能捕象三頭以上。不得射死牝象。」</p>
<p>非洲人捕象用槍射的方法，看起來似乎比印度捕象容易，又不必花費什麽大的成本；可是，因了象的性子不同，非洲捕死象反比印度人捕活象要艱難得多。非洲人捕象，是預先聚集一大隊人，都帶着獵槍，到叢密的森林裏候着；事先請幾個富有經騐的獵人往各處森林裏踏勘象的行踪。當他發現了象在什麼地方時，便馬上跑回通知。這種獵人在非洲很能受到一般捕象人的崇敬，在捕到了象之後他所得的私益也特別的多。</p>
<p>大隊的捕象人得到了通知，馬上就荷槍實彈的跟着報信的獵人出發；等到將要接近象所在的地方時，大家便連大氣也不敢出一聲，一齊蹲了下來。因爲象的嗅覺和聽覺都非常的敏銳，牠祗要聽到有點不同的響聲，就立刻機警的跑了，等捕象人再來追擊時，早已不知跑到什麽地方去了。所以一隊捕象人都有一個首領，居間指揮一切；捕象人站立的位置和射擊的方式都要聽首領的指揮。當開始射擊時，大家都站在一起遠遠地對着共同的目標把槍瞄準，首領一聲令下，大家便馬上一齊發槍；象受了多量槍子以後，就會支撑不住地倒了下來。如果用散兵綫式的個別射擊，那是非常危險的。因爲一頭象的體魄，决不是一兩顆子彈的力量可以制服下來；若果一槍命中了而牠沒有死，牠立刻就會向射擊的地方衝來，這時假如有人給牠看見，那他的生命就完了，無論你逃到什麼地方去，牠不追着你絕不肯倒地的。捕象要大隊的人同去，就是爲避免這種危險；因爲人多，站在一起發槍，火力旣猛，卽使人給牠看到了，牠因人多也就無從追逐了。</p>
<p>在非洲捕象的人，除了當地的土人以外，還不時有許多白人幹這種冒險的生活。象牙在非洲的價値並不怎樣高昻，可是一經運到美國和歐洲，相差便有幾倍之多，因此一般白人爲了企圖厚利，便也不惜拿生命送到非洲來和象打賭了。白人到這裏來捕象，大半是三五個人一隊；到了接近產象的區域時再僱當地的土人帮忙捕捉，事前講定多少錢一天的報酬，但，如遇有被僱的土人因捕象而喪失生命，白人是不負責的。</p>
<p>白人到這裏來的主要目的是在象牙；他住往費了幾月或整年的工夫，猶不開始捕象，祗專找死象的地方；那種地萬如果一經找到了，其所獲的象牙却比一年中所射下來的的象牙齒還要多得多，畢竟白種人是聰明的。這種情形，大槪在中國開映的外國獸片上常常可以看到的罷。</p>

<h3 id="c235">論讀書的態度 <a href="#c235" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e235" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">235</a></h3>
<p>— 雪</p>
<p>楊衛玉先生最近在敎育雜誌第二十五卷第三號讀書問題特輯中發表了一篇文章，主張「爲讀書而讀書」，原文大意謂：「……現在一般人的讀書大槪都有一種目的，分析起麥，有爲覺世濟民的，有爲功名利祿的，有爲應用的，有爲修養的，有爲欣賞的，有爲學業的，表面看起來，似乎都有芷當充分的理由，一言以蔽之，他們的讀書都是「有所爲」而讀的。吾以爲「有所爲」而讀書，不是眞讀書，是以讀書為工具，為手段而用以達期某種目的。等於學生為畢業證書而求學，著作家爲版權而著書，當然也有例外，但至少有一部分人等到目的達到，就把工具擱置了。這樣的讀書至多在智識方面增加一些資料，去讀書之眞義很遠。引領學問者為學問而學問，眞讀書者也應爲讀書而讀書，也就是「無所爲」而讀書。……」楊先生在這一篇文章裏所表現的姿態，是「讀書至上主義者」。他主張「眞讀書者爲讀書而讀書」，主張「無所爲而讀書」。他反對讀書有目的，否認「爲應用」「爲修養」「爲欣賞」而讀書。</p>
<p>以前，我們知道楊先生是職業敎育家，職業敎育家們向來是敎育的功利論者。他們曾以敎育與生活的分離爲非是，他們竭力倡導生計的敎育，手腦並用的敎育，工業農業商業等實際技能的敎育。但從這一篇文章看來，楊先生的思想似已與以前大不相同了。</p>
<p>古代我國的士大夫，除了醉心於功名的人之外，確是有少數是爲讀書而讀書的。他們以讀書爲消閒上品，以琴棋書畫爲娛樂，所謂「書中自有黄金屋，書中自有顏如玉」者是。他們絕對隔離世界，絕對隔離時代，雍容閒逸，養尊處優，以一切農工商人的營利爲卑賤，「爲讀書而讀書」的古代讀書人大多如是。因爲爲讀書而讀書的士大夫階級，他們生活於優游閒散豐衣足食的環境中，他們有祖宗餘蔭可以享受，有不必與實際生活作搏鬭的特殊境過，他們不要一技之長，就可以拿受到好的生活，所以他們的讀書完全是個人主義的，與社會與羣衆始終不會發生些微的關係，容或他在象牙塔中有些發現，但這發現對於歷史對於人類還是沒有貢獻的！</p>
<p>今日，我敢說决不是那個時代，今日的靑年，尤不是那個階級裏的靑年。今日的靑年要爲了增進生活的技能而讀書，要爲了健全身心的發育而讀書，讀畫要與實際生活打成一片才有興趣，才有效用。爲讀書而讀書的人，只看見天空間的海市蜃樓，只能讓有福氣的公子哥兒去欣賞讚嘆。</p>
<p>多數已經走入社會的靑年，他們大多在懊悔在學校時所讀的書，不能學以致用，離生活世界太遠了，這就是因爲他們當時不是爲生活而讀書的緣故。</p>
<p>一個人在學校讀書，應該針對着自已生活的目標，去豐富自己的知識。就是在社會服務的人，爲了業務精進的緣故，仍然要努力進修，决不如楊先生所說目的達到就把工具擱置」的。且他們的讀書，無論如何决不只爲了讀書而讀書，且讀書的興趣不一定要「爲讀書而讀書」才能增進，只有爲了解决業務的困難而讀書，也許因爲感於「需要」，其興趣才會此空洞的「書中自有黄金屋」式的讀書更加濃厚。</p>
<p>我上面所說的「興趣在於需要之源」那一層意思，是有最好的證據的。簡單舉個例罷，小學校中的敎學法，以前因探用注入式演講式，兒童反應力非常薄弱，甚至只感到痛苦，不感到興趣，現在提倡的啟發式，利用一種動機，使兒童感於某種需要而學習，其興趣自然要濃厚多了。又，敎育心理學家Peterson　曾作一試騐，用很多文字寫在黑板上，呌學生抄寫，過後卽呌他們默出來，隔一時，再呌他們默出來，這是第一個試騐。另一種試騐是，預先通知學生說，先抄一遍，後來要默寫的，然後再照第一法做一遍。結果，第二個試騐要比第一個成績好得多。可見第一個試騐是不知道需要的，爲抄寫而抄寫的，所以成績壞。第二個是知道需要的，爲需要而抄寫的，所以成績佳。</p>
<p>「爲畢業文憑而求學」的讀書觀念，誠然是錯誤的，「爲功名利祿而讀書」的讀書觀念，誠然也是錯誤的，但若說爲了應用爲了修養而讀書爲不對，那才眞的不對了！</p>

<h3 id="c242">賀浦曼綁案審判新聞片攝製之經過（上） <a href="#c242" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e242" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">242</a></h3>
<p>— 新尼</p>
<p>本年年初，美國最犬的新聞，就是綁架林白大尉的幼子，而加以殺害的綁匪，賀浦曼的審判。賀浦曼原籍德國，居美多年，業木匠。不知如何，他竟起意將美國人民所一致崇拜的，第一次横渡大西洋飛行成功的英雄，林白大佐的愛子綁了去，後來因爲各地搜査甚急，無法隱匿，就將那小兒殺害了，棄屍荒野。案破後，經過了多少次的硏審，終於判决死邢。</p>
<p>賀浦曼案審問的地方，是紐吉賽州，弗蘭明頓城的一個地方法院。這是美國轟動一時的大審問，當審訊期中，美國的各大通訊社每天將法庭內的情形拍電到世界各國。我們中國報紙，對於這個案子亦逐日排登過的。這樣，美國的新聞影片公司，當然亦不肯放鬆的了。</p>
<p>我們現在對於賀浦曼綁案審問，有二個問題可以加以叙述和討論的。一個是賀案攝製的經過，有沒有運法的地方。第二個問題，就是賀案的新聞片，是否應攝入電影。這二個問題，在新聞片的攝製上，頗有討論的價値，而是我們攝製新聞片的關係者，所　當加以注意的。</p>
<p>就第一點來講，當時曾有人提違法不違法的問題，而檢察長城侖資亦曾有如攝影人員不服指揮之時，法庭將對於影片公司，提出藐視法庭之控訴。有人說：這種新聞影片的攝製，本來是違法的，不是可以公然拍到的，而現在各影片公司放映的賀案新聞片，是違法秘密拍攝的。簡而言之，他們用了詭計，隱秘，以及毀信等方法，才得到了相當的效果。</p>
<p>眞實的情形，到底是怎樣的？當然祇有親自在塲拍影片的人知道。於是就有人拿這個問題，去問了一位環球新聞影片公司的賀案拍攝的主持人，却利福特。却利福特一些不遲疑的，將當時拍攝的情形講了出來。</p>
<p>他說：「其中一些虛僞欺騙沒有的。」他拿了一張法庭中的照片，指示給那位訪問者。「那個就是拍攝賀案新聞片的開來拉。旁邊站立的，就是開末拉曼，丹夫奧立佛。那個是開末拉的活動座箱，四尺見方，二尺厚。當然這許多東西，是無法可以隱藏的。』</p>
<p>這樣，我們可以知道，賀案的新聞片，並不是違法秘密拍攝的，但是收音怎樣收的呢？照著好萊塢的」位名記者文吉爾的說法，錄音機是　藏著放在庭長的檯子下面的，但是那亦不確的。</p>
<p>却利福特特爲將收音帥喬師格萊姆請了來，陳述當時錄音的內容，因爲他是在塲錄音的技師。</p>
<p>喬治格萊姆說道：「那眞是笑話，不可能的。說這種話的人，是一些不知道錄音的原理的。如果錄音機放在庭長檯子底下的話，那所能收到的不過是一種悶住的嗡嗡之聲。全法庭的鬧聲，將混亂無章的攝入。但是我們所攝到的，是極淸楚的發言。」</p>
<p>據喬治的陳述，他們的錄音機楚裝置在墻上，人人可以看得到的。錄音機的後面，並且有一塊半圓的紙版，可以旋轉而直對發音的地方的。有一夭一個庭丁故意將那塊紙版扯了去。後來喬治曾化了兩塊錢，叫另外一個庭丁，重裝上去的。當然，一些秘密沒有的了。</p>
<p>却利福特又說道：「當賀浦曼案沒有開審之前，五家大公司先舉行了一次會議，商定了合作的辦法。」他從抽屜內取出了一張紙道：「這就是我們大家簽訂的合同。我們有三架大開末拉，一架裝在法庭之內，一架裝在法庭圖書館中，一架裝在法院前陽台上。這三架東西，是人人看得見的，而收音機的電線，足有一寸粗，亦是很觸目的東西，毫無隱秘可言的。</p>
<p>「並且，報紙上都登載過的，當第一次開夜庭時，庭裏的電燈忽然全部熄滅了。你知道怎樣發生的？原來是因爲庭內裝置了拍影片用的『福托水光燈』，以致電力過强，而將電門總線爆斷之所致，後來水光燈不用了，而改用了三百瓦的燈泡，才沒有出第二次念子。當然，法庭上大家知道有人在拍影片的。」（未完）</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3 id="c243">評「兒女英雄」 <a href="#c243" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e243" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">243</a></h3>
<p>— 尤兢</p>
<p>Clive　Of　India</p>
<p>說起這位征服印度的英雄克莢夫（Robert　Clive）。</p>
<p>我們實有略爲接觸一下「印度亡國史」之必要的。自從地亞士（Diaz）和華期喀，達，伽瑪（Vaaco　daGama）等和哥倫布發現美洲似的發現了印度之後，葡萄牙的艦隊首先就來到，於是荷蘭與法英亦追縱來成立東印度公司，而在這奇富的半島上互作侵略的競賽。因爲各國主觀條件的决定，只有法國成爲英國最後的勁敵。從利用印度土著王公的排擠英人，進而直接用兵來奪英人根據地。英軍在屢敗之後，幸得克萊夫出來轉敗爲勝地制服了法人，訂定印度不得駐法兵的條件。於是英人的勢力就擴展到全印度。嗣後孟加拉王薩拉烏特都拉（Suraj　Ud　Dowlah）起來作抵抗侵略的戰爭，英人又把榮歸故鄉的克萊決調來，他利誘王叔密爾耶法的倒戈叛亂而戰勝了。這就是歷史上有名的一七五七年的普拉賽（Plassey）之戰。從此孟加拉就成爲英國的領土，東印度也成爲政治經濟侵略的總機關。主其事的人習用着克萊夫對土著王公挑撥離間，利誘威嚇的故技，到了一八五七年整個的印度便完全成爲殖民地了。</p>
<p>影片「兒女英雄」就是基於這段歷史故事作成的。在這世界經濟恐慌日益加深，推銷市塲競爭日烈，同時又是風雲變幻，戰機日迫，殖民地解放運動日漸澎湃的今日，一般野心的侵略者們，日夜夢想着再得幾大槐殖民地來分割，以解救半身不遂的政治經濟的國際殭局，同時也企望着克萊夫式的英雄之再生，來經營與鎭壓動搖的殖民地，於是這「兒女英雄」的出現，就成爲這些夢想與企望的療飢品與興雷劑了。</p>
<p>「兒女英雄」一方而是侵略者熱狂的回想，依稀的憧憬，另一方而也是對正動蕩着的弱小民族自立運動的示威作。囚此，在「兒女英雄」中，我們只能看到從英雄豐功你烈之側面所透露出來的一點印度滅亡的影子，只能從美人的嬌啼微嗔中領略些弱小民放的呼息。</p>
<p>“CliveofInia”的成爲「兒女英雄」這種的片子，絕不是偶然的。劇作者歪曲了歷史意義，抹煞了客觀背景，而在强調克萊夫個人英雄之餘，更誇張着他與賢淑的夫人瑪格勒蒂問的兒女柔情，這一企圖是在略事掩飾上面所指出他們的用心。也因爲如此，把這如色鮮艷，氣味血醒的偉大史料，形成了尋常的戰爭艷情片子。不惜盡情地描繪英雄克萊夫，煊染美人淑女，賢母良妻的瑪格蕾帝。在作者也許認爲這樣才是相得益彰，殊不知也就此失去了較大的成果。</p>
<p>這裏的字幕似嫌太多，在若干歷史劇的編製中，應用字幕原是不得已的法子，但這兒劇作者却是過分偏重了主人公克萊夫的個人，而用過多的字幕來代替了若干畫面。寫克萊夫的初懷大志，寫瑪格勒蒂的接着不相識者的情書就眞的趕來，這些重要的性格特點，多未有適當與充份的處理。</p>
<p>導演Riulard　Boleslawski的手法乃是可取的。寫克萊夫夫婦的本身細膩而不厭煩，寫週遭也活潑而不嫌簡陋。英兵被圍的鳥瞰攝，及印王宮中淫樂的俯攝，殊見魄力。只是衆院法庭中的大塲戲顯得呆板，滯笨。</p>
<p>論演技，我得推舉瑪格勒蒂第一次見克萊夫那塲戲中洛萊泰楊的表情。由全劇看，她的嬌憨熱忱的少女，演來比世故理智的少婦爲妙。考爾門的在法庭中被栽判時的戲是失敗了的。演小舅子艾德蒙的化裝太疎忽，妹妹的髮式幾度地變老了，何以他還是那麽年輕，沒有添些皺紋呢？</p>
<h3 id="c244">科學藝術新發展五彩立體影片演出 <a href="#c244" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e244" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">244</a></h3>
<p>— 志</p>
<p>近數年來的電影科學藝術美滿的成功，和進展的孟晋，無可諱言地，早已給電影的觀衆們一個深切的認識和讚美。最近在電影藝術的進程中，更有一件給世人們極大注意的新發現。這就是五彩立體影片的成功。</p>
<p>自從十九世紀，電影有史以來，有色影片的製造，經過有好幾個逐步進展的時期。直到現在，經過數年的試騐，這十全十美的五彩立體影片卒於成功，而完全天然彩色的「痴情舞伴」現在巳經和我們相見了。</p>
<p>二十五年來五彩影片的攝製，已經不知試騐過多少方法。但是所得的結果總沒有令人得到十分的滿意。雖然平常的五彩正片和卡通片的顏色，從觀衆們看來，多數是已經覺得牠鮮艷悅目。但是從技術方面嚴格地說起來，這些五彩都還有登峰造極的成功。</p>
<p>現在的五彩立體影片的方法是根據着三色方法、Three　Colour　System兩者不同的地方，就是前者是一張片子祗用兩套底片印成。而現在的，在拍一張片子的時候却用三副底片同時作同一目標的攝拍。採用的基本色彩，一副是紅色，一副是黄色和一副藍色的。因爲用三種不同地位的鏡頭攝取，而印成一片，映出同一事物。於是現成了立體。</p>
<p>幾個月以前，當雷電華公司的監製者馬林古柏考慮這種五彩影片方法之後，就知道五彩影片一定會增加不少觀衆的情感和片子本身的娛樂的價値。等到五彩立體攝影法發明人約翰海惠尼試騐成功之後，就和他表弟溫得比合作起來攝製。又因爲片子裏搆色問題的重要，就挽留着這位世界著名的舞台劇設計師羅勃宗氏主持其事。羅勃宗氏對於這種新興的藝術，感到無限的興趣，頗想把自己色素搆和的經騐，作一些有價値的作品貢獻給社會。後來「癡情舞伴」完成，他已得到極度的成功了。而且得到世界科學藝術學院一九三四年的褒獎。</p>
<p>「小婦人」的出品者漢納麥高門也就是這張片子的出品者。這次還有嘉利夫人努力地帮忙着他的工作。導演是羅阿立根。攝影師是雷南之漢。他是一位最著名的五彩影片攝影帥。</p>
<p>去年秋季裏，公司已經有了用五彩立體技術拍攝長片的計劃。所以這張「癡情舞伴」就是將來五彩立體長片的先導者了。女主角就是主演「蓬島一枝花」的匈牙利女郞史蒂芙竇娜女士。男主角是以西班牙舞蹈著名的唐阿爾華利度。其他的配角也都是好萊塢一時之選。</p>

<p>紅氈毺上之好女兒童月娟，前曾在新華影業公司之紅羊豪俠傳聲片中飾一賣唱歌女。靑帕遮頭，布衣敝舊，一洗平日脂粉之氣與綺羅之香。神情之妙，表演之眞，導演楊小仲認爲極有希望之人才。此次攝裝桃花扇，導演歐陽予倩亦以劇中主角謝素芳，由童充飾爲最合宜。童固對於銀燈工作，甚感興趣，欣然允諾。惟童之貝齒，鑲以黄金，深恐此燦然者入諸鏡頭，變爲黑色，有似脫落之處。乃毅然將金齒付諸剷除，日內卽行開拍云。</p>

<p>上海有聲影片公司近來攝製「桃花夢」，工作甚為緊張。是劇為鄭逸梅手編，但杜宇導演，殷明珠主演。殷雖歷主諸片，然在聲片中開口，尙屬第一次。</p>
<p>「桃花夢」中有「金錢世界歌」，由黎　暉撰製，極諷刺之能事。</p>
<p>倉隱秋，英茵，周鳳文，但頻頻等，均在「桃花夢一中充飾要角。</p>
<p>打倒婦女之虛榮，揭破社會之萬惡，此爲「桃花夢」之唯一宗旨。故初審時，卽得電檢會之嘉許云。</p>

<p>— 緹雲</p>
<p>脫雷的眼睛是閉着的，但是他的手指却摸索到了愛梅的手，緊緊的抓着。他微微喘息着說道：「愛梅……你嫁給華德……他是好八　……華德……」愛梅聽了，幾幾乎要哭出來，可是她勉強忍住了說道：「我要嫁給你……得新的嫁給你……祗要你肯要我……脫雷我的愛……」</p>
<p>脫雷想笑，但是正在這個時候，一陣劇痛冷不防的巳經改進了他的心窩。愛梅的頭，別過了一邊，不忍再看下去了。脫雷的聲音更微弱了，可是他還斷斷續續的說着：一要叫我……演說……題目……死……死神是愚畫的……怎樣對付它……不差的……我……」他的聲昔在渺茫之中漸漸消逝了。他的眼睛還是閉着，可是他的一隻手，却鬆了掉了下來。</p>
<p>愛梅還是跪在他的身旁。她知道一切都成了已往了。天下更沒有可以使她在乎的事了。但是她是跪着一些不動，直等到華德悄然地走到她的跟前，輕輕將她扶了起來。</p>
<p>脫雷死的時候，正是一個夏天。但是夏天默默地過去了，秋天將樹上的葉子，都刮了去，冬天又來了，將大地蓋上了一層白絨氈，在這艱難的歲月之中，華德是永遠站在她的身旁，以友誼的熱情來帮助她愛護她，永遠沒有離開過她。</p>
<p>那又是一個雪後的下午，華德和愛梅默然的從在公園裏長凳上。愛梅的眼睛，直直的看着來來往往的汽車，不覺爲之神往。華德在一旁，靜靜的看了她一回，然後說道：「愛梅，我們該走了。這種天隨時部可以下雨的」愛梅道：我喜歡下雨……」</p>
<p>大家默然了一回，華德不覺呌了她一聲：「愛梅……愛梅道：「是的，我的愛？華德囁嚅着道：「你想想，我覺得最好是……；忘記了他吧……不要去想他吧。」愛梅徐徐地抬起頭來，看一着華德的臉，將兩隻手都放在他的手裏。她說道：「但是，華德，我已經忘記了……他的一切，我都忘記了……一切的一切！你瞧，我决定了要忘記……我就眞的忘記了！」</p>
<p>華德拍着她的手，他們不覺四目相視，默然不語，但以心會意。他們站了起來，慢慢走出了花園。華德呌了一輛街車。愛梅緊緊地抱着華德的臂膊。華德是永遠不會使她失望的。他會將平安放在她的心中……他可以給她一個保障。不錯的，她確已忘記了脫雷了。</p>
<p>她一面走，一面自言自語着：忘懷，華德，那是一個印第安紅人的酋長敎給我的……他住在達哥塔的黑山之中……我和他很友善……他臨死，敎了我那個秘訣……」</p>
<p>一輛街車在路旁停了下來。華德扶着愛梅上了汽車，自己亦跳下進去。那正是陰暗的黃晉，那輛汽車不久就在白漫漫的雪中消逝了。（完）</p>

<p>Guiyang: The General Headquarters received a telegram from Xue Yue from the front lines on the morning of the 25th, stating that after Zhu and Mao's bandit troops were routed by our army near Longhei, they fled westward through Guangshun, Zhenfeng, and Xingren. At noon on the 20th, they were intercepted by Wu Cong's and Ou Liang's divisions of our army near Guanyin Cave, north of Xingren. Fierce fighting continued until noon on the 21st, when our Ou division launched a fierce attack on the bandits' left flank from Suotang, engaging in several hand-to-hand combats.

<p>Guiyang: Chiang, Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission, has issued an order strictly prohibiting the private transportation of military supplies to aid the communist bandits.

A report received here today states that the government army in northern Sichuan has recovered Changxi (transliteration), killing 400 communist bandits, capturing 800, and seizing a large quantity of military supplies (Reuters dispatch, 26th).</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Since the National Government officially appointed Chairman Chiang as a Special Class General, Chiang recently (on the 16th) telegraphed Chairman Lin. Chairman Lin replied with a special telegram on the 17th. The original texts of the two telegrams are as follows: (Chiang's telegram) Urgent to Chairman Lin of Nanjing, greetings. I have reverently read the National Government's official order appointing me as a Special Class General. I am filled with trepidation upon hearing this decree. I, Zhongzheng, have made errors in commanding troops, and I have dedicated myself to the Party and the country. The bandit scourge still awaits eradication, and military affairs still require reorganization. As the difficulties have not yet ended, to be granted such a high honor only makes me more aware of the dangers and more deeply vigilant. I can only exert my limited abilities to repay your generous favor. I respectfully submit my humble thoughts and humbly request your review. Chiang Zhongzheng bows and declares, Shen Zhu. (Chairman Lin's telegram) To Chiang, Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission, Guiyang, esteemed greetings. I have just received your telegram and admire your humility. You, sir, are the model of human virtues and a founding hero of the Party and the country. You have stabilized the nation and are universally admired for your extraordinary achievements. Following the laws of the country, you should receive an extraordinary and lofty rank. Thinking of your virtuous labor, I offer my deepest congratulations and prayers. Lin Sen bows in gratitude (Central Telegram, 27th).</p>

<h3 id="e4">Two Major Principles Set for Income Tax Collection <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The income tax was first promulgated in January of the third year of the Republic [1914], and the first set of implementing regulations for the income tax was promulgated in August of the fourth year [1915]. In January of the tenth year [1921], the draft implementing regulations for the income tax law and the order of tax collection for different income items, the rules of procedure for the Income Tax Investigation and Assessment Committee, the rules for income tax collection, the regulations for evaluating income tax collection, and the regulations for the storage and allocation of income tax funds were drafted. In April of the same year, the regulations for the treasury management of income tax funds were also promulgated. The first financial conference in the seventeenth year [1928] re-submitted the draft income tax law and the steps for implementing the regulations. In January of the eighteenth year [1929], the draft income tax law was revised again, but after several discussions and revisions, it was never promulgated and implemented. This time, the tax was carefully studied by the Tax System Reform Research Association, and it was decided to implement it. Two major principles were set first: that the tax rate on income earned from labor should be low, and that income earned from capital should be subject to a progressive system. In the initial stage of planning, the scale should be small and the tax rate low. The Ministry of Finance does not hope that the income from income tax collection will be used to offset the national treasury's needs, but rather to create a habit of paying this tax among the people (Special Dispatch, 27th).</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Gao Bingfang discussed that the income tax revenue in various countries is relatively high because of the development of their domestic industries. In our country, however, industry and commerce are exhausted, and the industry is backward. It is expected that the annual tax amount will not be large. At the beginning of the implementation, we should carefully examine the people's sentiments. This time, the planning uses uniform standards, and simultaneous implementation does not distinguish between early taxation and gradual taxation. However, elementary school teachers serve the people and their lives have always been very difficult. Charitable undertakings seek welfare for society, and neither should be taxed. As for the income of university professors and others that meets the tax standards, they will also be taxed, but it should be lighter than that for income from capital. In short, the income tax is based on the amount of income. Those engaged in production with high income and high profits will pay more taxes. Those whose income is not enough to cover expenses or who have meager profits are not subject to tax collection. It is also heard that the revision of the regulations is nearing completion, and the Legislative Yuan and the Ministry of Finance have exchanged opinions and are in complete agreement. It is generally expected that they can be transferred to the Legislative Yuan for deliberation and enactment of the regulations. The regulations are scheduled to be promulgated on July 1st. Although the implementation procedures are complicated, companies, factories, and businesses such as banks, money shops, gold shops, and jewelry stores that are registered according to the law or licensed by the government are relatively easy to investigate. The general income of individuals will be dealt with separately. All collection methods are still under careful study (Special Dispatch, 27th).</p>

<h3 id="e30">The Future of Germany's Diplomatic Status <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>— Heng</p>
<p>Since the National Socialist Party came to power in Germany, almost all European countries have been alarmed and have been devising ways to respond. This led to the intensified unity of the French Little Entente, followed by the collaboration between France and Russia and the coordination of Italy. Most recently, there has been a rapprochement between Britain and France, and a change in Poland's direction. Looking at the changes in the European situation over the past year, France has benefited the most. However, the isolation of Germany's international status today is unprecedented. The reason for this result is mainly due to the aggressive policies of the National Socialist Party. To avoid this kind of isolated position, the key lies in changing policies. In other words, it means rejoining the League of Nations and shaking hands with other countries in reconciliation. However, observing Hitler's determination to reorganize armaments internally after announcing conscription, and his tough attitude towards foreign countries, it is clear that it is impossible for Germany to rejoin the League of Nations in the near future. Thus, Germany's isolated state will inevitably continue for a short period. However, whether Germany can avoid jeopardizing its national security due to international isolation in the long run is a question worthy of attention by those who are concerned about international affairs. Today, the international atmosphere in Europe is indeed quite tense, but very few European countries are willing to resort to war. The most obvious is that France today, although it has the greatest fear of Germany, does not have the determination to resort to war against Germany. This is because France's best interest today lies in maintaining the status quo, so that this state of temporary stability can be maintained for as long as possible. Britain, due to its position, is also unwilling to act rashly. France must take this point into consideration in order to obtain Britain's cooperation. Although the League of Nations recently passed France's application regarding Germany's rearmament, the punishment for Germany was limited to a mere piece of paper. Furthermore, France's unwillingness to commit to automatic mutual assistance conditions with Russia in the Franco-Russian accord shows that behind the scenes of European diplomacy, there is in fact a mature and prudent Britain strategizing. Since Britain and France both emphasize maintaining the status quo, their policy towards Germany naturally favors maintaining the League of Nations and waiting for Germany to rejoin. Since they want to maintain the League of Nations, the British and French sides must leave room for Germany to join, so that the door to peace will not be closed, regardless of whether Germany is willing to join. Therefore, Britain and France's attitude towards Germany today stems from the fear of harming something valuable while trying to get rid of something undesirable. Precisely because of this, although Germany's international status today is extremely isolated and the diplomatic front surrounding Germany is extremely tight, it does not pose a major threat to Germany's security.</p>
<p>Some may say that in 1923, when Germany failed to pay reparations, France sent troops to the Ruhr to seek compensation. In light of past examples, who knows whether France will not resort to such measures against Germany again in the future? However, in our view, this kind of observation is an overestimation. This is because the current international situation is very different from the past. First, it is clear that today's Germany will not tolerate such actions by France. Second, France's actions at that time had a considerable legal basis under the reparations clause of the Treaty of Versailles (although the British later considered it illegal). As for Germany's action to abolish Part V of the treaty this time, Germany also has a valid reason. This is because the first sentence of this part states, "In order to make possible a general limitation of the armaments of all nations, Germany undertakes strictly to observe the military, naval and air clauses which follow…" Germany's disarmament is conditional upon the general disarmament of all nations. Now that the nations are not disarming, Germany has the potential for rearmament in terms of legality. Third, Britain and France had already negotiated the points of contention regarding the abolition of Part V of the treaty, but they wanted to present it in the form of international public recognition. Fourth, since Britain and France want to strengthen the power of the League of Nations, their actions must be based on the charter of the League of Nations. Unless Germany acts recklessly and provocatively, the military sanctions clause will be difficult to implement. Fifth, today's Japan is fortunate that something is happening in Western Europe. If Britain and France act carelessly, an unprecedented world war affecting the entire globe will be unavoidable. Britain and France know this, so their actions towards Germany cannot but adopt an attitude of "not going too far." For these reasons, it would be good if Germany could rejoin the League of Nations today. If it does not rejoin the League of Nations, France, in addition to concluding various passive defense treaties with other countries, will be hard-pressed to take more aggressive actions. Therefore, in this situation, if Germany can (1) not violate the demilitarized zone of the Rhineland, (2) not take military action against Austria, and (3) not seek development in Eastern Europe, then its military rearmament will not cause war. The tough foreign policy of Germany's National Socialist Party today is probably due to a clear understanding of this kind of international relationship.</p>

<p>Antung: According to the Japan Shipping Company's Japan-Manchuria Liaison, a Fokker passenger plane departed from Dairen on the morning of the 26th to fly to Shingishu. However, after flying over Dako Island, its whereabouts became unknown. Later, the Antung Police Station received a phone call stating that two mail packages were found one li northwest of Dako Island. The authorities believed that it had encountered difficulties due to fog and mobilized military police to search for its whereabouts. The plane had no passengers this time, with pilot Shimizu flying the plane and mechanic Haraoka accompanying him. (27th Jiji News Agency)</p>
<p>Antung: There is still no news about the Japan-Manchuria Liaison airplane that went missing yesterday. The mail packages carried by the plane drifted to the coast of Dako Island, so there is little doubt that the plane crashed into the sea. The sea in that area is quite windy and the search work is extremely difficult. According to a report received by the Antung Police Station at 3:00 PM on the 27th, a crashed airplane was found on a beach west of Oshika Island at 1:00 PM this afternoon. The Dako Island branch immediately dispatched personnel to the scene to provide assistance. (27th Jiji News Agency)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Ministry of Communications attaches great importance to the Japan-Manchuria Liaison airplane accident. Director Ningaoka of the Aviation Bureau and other staff are studying the cause of the accident, but have not obtained any information. (27th Jiji News Agency)</p>

<p>(London) The London silver market is extremely chaotic. Speculators from all over the world are vying to buy silver, but there are very few sellers. There are many transactions, so brokers spend an hour more than usual to settle the silver price. The spot price is listed at 36 25/100 pence, up 1 375/1000 pence, which is the highest price since July 8, 1922. Buyers are still not satisfied, causing the price to continue to rise by 375/1000. According to brokers, purchase orders are pouring in, almost overwhelming them. The domestic silver purchase price in the United States is equivalent to 35 625/1000 pence in British gold. The selling price in the world market has exceeded the U.S. fixed price due to the activities of speculators. Whether President Roosevelt will raise the silver price again is what speculators are currently hesitant about. According to experts, this situation is alarming, because the situation is completely artificial and can only be maintained if the United States buys heavily in the world market. Today, there are indeed Americans buying in London, but brokers cannot determine whether they are buying on behalf of the U.S. government or for speculation. (26th Reuters)</p>
<p>Mexico City: The government today ordered a thorough reform of the Mexican currency system. The government is also collecting all silver coins and replacing them with small-denomination banknotes. Before this order was issued, the silver price in the foreign exchange market soared. Speculators and hoarders unanimously collected Mexican currency on the market, waiting for the silver price to rise sharply before melting it into silver bars and selling it for profit. Mexican Treasury official Lopez has flown to Washington, urgently seeking to meet with U.S. Treasury Secretary Morgenthau to discuss ways to deal with the current crisis. The National Bank of Mexico announced that it will close tomorrow. President Cardenas said that he will soon amend the banking law to stipulate the exchange rate between the Mexican currency and the U.S. dollar at 3.6. The President also said that we will maintain the Mexican currency at a favorable level. The Treasury also announced that it will issue an order tomorrow, Saturday, to establish a national reserve bureau to replace the reserve functions of the Bank of Mexico, effectively making the bank a clearing bank. The order will immediately become law. (26th Central News Agency)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Overseas silver prices continue to soar. The Bank of Japan's Suiyōkai raised the silver price by 3 yen, 1 kak, and 3 rin again on the 27th, setting the price per kilo of silver at 86 yen, 9 kak, 8 fun, and 1 rin. (27th Jiji Press)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Due to the high price of overseas silver, the Suiyōkai announced today that it would raise the price by 3 yen, 1 kak, and 3 fun, to 86 yen, 9 kak, 8 fun, and 1 rin. The market price in the city is also selling for 2 or 3 kak and 4 fun per day, and buying for 3 kak, reaching the highest price since Taisho 9. The association also observed that the U.S. government would raise the purchase price of silver to 85 or 90 U.S. cents, and then to 2 U.S. dollars. Therefore, it is only a matter of time before the price of Japanese silver reaches 100 yen in Japanese currency. In addition, large wholesalers in Tokyo have suspended sales because they are certain that prices will rise in the future, so there is only a market price but no transactions. (27th Dentsu)</p>
<h3 id="e34">U.S. Treasury Secretary Meets with Senate Silver Faction; Future Steps Not Yet Decided <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>(Washington) Treasury Secretary Morgenthau and Senate leaders today thoroughly discussed the future steps of the silver purchase plan. Those present from the Senate side were Pittman, Wheeler, Borah, King, and Adams. The Treasury Secretary and Senate leaders discussed the following points: (1) Immediately set the Treasury's silver price at $1.29 per ounce. (2) Continue to pay bonuses for the purchase of newly mined silver. (3) Base silver purchases on world silver prices, abolishing bonuses for domestic silver. (4) Set the price of newly mined silver at $1 per ounce. It is still doubtful whether the world silver price will rise to this level. Secretary Morgenthau stated that he would consult with another leader of the congressional silver faction, McCarran, tomorrow before deciding on specific actions. It is said that this meeting will recommend abolishing the profit tax and setting the silver price at $1.29. Although the silver price paid by the Treasury has increased, the silver purchased in the week before April 19 decreased to $2,619,195, compared to the previous average of approximately $5,000,000 per week. At 4:30 PM today, just minutes before the meeting, a Treasury spokesperson stated that the Treasury had no announcement regarding silver prices today. (116th Central News Agency)</p>
<p>(Washington) Although foreign silver prices rose today, the Treasury Department did not raise the silver purchase price. Outsiders therefore speculate that the U.S. government intends to observe market developments before making a decision. Yesterday, the financial and economic experts hired by the government held a long meeting. As far as the general public knows, these experts have already agreed on the silver policy that the United States should adopt in the near future. Although it is impossible to know how the decision will be made, one can guess that if the experts decide to continue to implement the policy of raising silver prices, the Treasury Department would have already made an announcement today. The U.S. government currently has two options: (1) Stop buying silver, in which case there will be a strong reaction in the market. (2) Continue to buy, allowing speculators to profit. The situation of the silver problem is becoming increasingly complex due to the influence of domestic politics. Since the implementation of the silver policy has had a good effect on the United States, the silver faction will inevitably be dissatisfied if it changes course. In addition, President Roosevelt has important legislative procedures and wants to obtain the approval of a majority of members of Congress, so he is unwilling to offend the silver faction. However, conservatives will severely criticize the silver policy. Yesterday, Chinese Ambassador Shih Chao-chi met with Secretary of State Hull, informally mentioning the exchange of notes between China and the United States in October 1934 and the promises made by the United States. At that time, the United States agreed to avoid disrupting China's economic situation as much as possible while implementing the silver policy. So far, China's protest remains an isolated action, with no one responding. Mexico, on the other hand, is not unhappy to hear about the rise in silver prices, so it has not protested to the United States. For Mexico, although the rise in silver prices is sufficient to cause the adverse effect of deflation, it can be compensated by raising the exchange rate of the Mexican currency against the U.S. dollar. As for the increase in the exchange rate, it may affect Mexico's foreign trade, but the extra profits obtained after the increase in silver prices can offset the losses. (26th Havas)</p>
<p>(Washington) Silver Senator McCarran today advocated that the White House should immediately increase the purchase price of domestic mined silver to $1.29 per ounce, saying that this would curb foreign speculation and end the Treasury's purchases. However, the speaker said that if the silver price is not increased to form a certain ratio with gold, such as 16 to 1, then when the silver price reaches $1.29, the Treasury must absorb a large amount of silver to maintain this price. If the gold-silver ratio is 16 to 1, then the legal price of silver per ounce will be $2.18. Silver senators in general today hoped that the purchase price of domestic mined silver would be raised again today, believing that the silver price should increase from 77.57 cents to 84.4 cents based on previous procedures. However, the government has not made this announcement today. It is also difficult to predict whether there will be a price increase tomorrow. Senator King met with Treasury Secretary Morgenthau today. King told reporters that silver speculation is regrettable. There has been some speculation in the stock market recently, with hoarding. He wanted to see silver speculators take a hit. This is not difficult to do. Just temporarily stop buying or indicate that there is no reason for speculation. It is also heard that President Roosevelt and the Treasury Secretary consulted today, although the events discussed could not be confirmed, but it is generally believed that it must be related to silver. In the afternoon, President Roosevelt met with silver senators again, but the content was not detailed. Handy &amp; Harman fixed the New York silver price today at 81 cents. Later, someone was willing to sell large bars outside the market at 79.62 cents, but no one bought at this price. It is estimated that the liquid supply of all silver in the United States is between 15 million and 30 million, while the silver bullion and scrap silver held by industrial consumers are not included. The supply of silver in the Montreaux silver market is currently less than 4 million ounces, and there are 6 million ounces still registered in the New York Commodities Exchange warehouse. (116th Reuters)</p>
<p>(Washington) Washington has not yet criticized Mexico's move to recall silver coins. Mexico's steps to prevent the outflow of silver were expected. Official circles in Washington are also silent on the repercussions caused by the U.S. government's silver policy. It is reported that Treasury Secretary Morgenthau will discuss everything with representatives of the Mexican government and then convene a meeting of silver senators. At the same time, newspapers still carry severe criticisms of the authorities' policies. The New York Telegram said that silver senators are elated, and some advocate immediately announcing a domestic silver price of $1.29 in order to reduce speculators, but the Treasury Department is silent. We value the Treasury Secretary, but it is doubtful whether someone with more talent than the Treasury Secretary is needed to issue a non-empty and non-absurd statement at this time. Today's policy is even more ridiculous than the purchase of gold in 1933. The authorities are simply holding a bull's tail in a china shop in their silver policy. (27th Reuters)</p>
<h3 id="e35">London Silver Prices Fall Back; Bombay Silver Prices Rise and Fall <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>(London) London silver prices fell back 1.125 pence today. The spot price is 35.125 pence, and the futures price is 35.25 pence. Speculators fear unfavorable developments in the United States later this week, so they are taking profits, which is why the market price has fallen. There were many transactions today, and brokers worked until the afternoon. There are currently two rumors in the market: one is that the United States will decide to set the silver purchase price abroad at $1.29, and the other is that President Roosevelt will only set the domestic price at $1.29, while allowing the world market price to float naturally. If so, the collapse of the current bullish position would be severely damaging. Mexico's move to recall silver coins is not surprising. This move will further reduce the available supply in the world market. (27th Reuters)</p>
<p>Bombay: This morning, Bombay buying prices rose 2 rupees and 14 annas to 3 rupees, but due to the loosening of silver prices in the Shanghai market, prices turned weak, falling 4 rupees to 4 rupees and 2 annas. (27th Reuters)</p>
<p>Increase in Outflow of British Silver: (London) In the week ending April 24, the outflow of silver from Britain increased compared to the previous week, while imports decreased sharply. Exports totaled £619,000, of which £464,000 went to the United States and £29,000 to Bombay. In the previous week, Britain exported silver worth a total of £444,000, with the United States taking £265,000. Last week, silver imports into Britain totaled £191,000, of which £91,000 came from Japan, £21,000 from Australia, and £41,000 from Egypt, a decrease of £431,000 from the previous week. Last week's net exports were valued at £428,000, compared to net revenue of £178,000 in the previous week. (26th Reuters)</p>
<p>Decrease in Silver Imports to the U.S.: (Washington) In the two weeks ending April 19, the United States imported silver worth a total of $2,619,000, a decrease of $1,067,000 from the previous week. Of this, $1,606,000 came from the United Kingdom, $323,000 from Mexico, $426,000 from Canada, $42,000 from Russia, $28,000 from Hong Kong, and the remainder from countries in Central and South America.

<p>(Washington) Recently, the European situation has been quite tense. President Roosevelt yesterday discussed with Norman Davis, the U.S. Chief Delegate to the Disarmament Conference, the issue of the U.S. maintaining neutrality in wartime. It is generally speculated that the President may issue a declaration of a definite principle regarding neutrality. Former Secretary of State Stimson of the Hoover government issued a statement saying, "If war does break out in the world and the United States does not want to be drawn into the vortex, the only way is for the United States to cooperate effectively with other countries to prevent conflicts from occurring and thus causing a world war. As for the U.S. government formulating a neutrality policy, that is a secondary strategy." (28th Havas)</p>

<p>(Washington) Philippine Senate President Quezon today predicted close cooperation between Washington authorities and Manila official circles during the autonomous period. Quezon stated his views on future cooperation to an Associated Press reporter, saying that Washington's attitude is both sympathetic and supportive. My last meeting with President Roosevelt lasted an hour and no outsiders participated. I feel that the President is very willing to help the Filipinos and has a deep understanding of the Philippine problem. Quezon also said that the Filipinos are fortunate to have President Roosevelt in power and Governor-General Murphy governing Manila when they made their requests. Both statesmen are willing to use their spirit of cooperation and exercise their powers and talents to help the Filipinos. When asked whether he agrees with the bimetallic monetary system, Quezon said that he has never considered reforming the currency system of the Philippines. It is not appropriate to discuss this issue during this transition between old and new governments. We should be very cautious about this kind of reform before taking any steps to fundamentally reform the overall situation. What is needed now is to instill the idea of economic security into the Filipinos. (26th Central News Agency)</p>

<h3 id="e40">US House of Representatives Passes $460 Million Naval Spending Bill, Largest Peacetime Naval Budget, Several Amendments Rejected <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>(Washington) The government previously submitted a naval budget proposal for this year to the House of Representatives, requesting an appropriation of $460,000,000, which is the largest peacetime naval budget. Yesterday, the House Appropriations Committee presented it for discussion, believing that the huge naval expenditure would make the American people and other countries feel uneasy. Therefore, it reduced the proposed expenditure of $9,380,000 for building 24 new ships by $15,000,000. The House met to discuss and passed the government's original proposal, and sent it to the Senate. This bill allocates a total of $460,000,000 to build 24 new warships to replace those that have reached the end of their service life, and to build 555 aircraft, and to build a metal airship with $70,000. The naval aviation expenditure increased to $52,000,000. In addition, the number of naval officers was increased by 2,677, bringing the total number of officers to 8,176. The number of soldiers was increased by 9,000, bringing the total number to 93,500. The total increase was more than 11,600 personnel. (Havas, 26th)</p>
<p>(Washington) The House of Representatives today resolutely passed the $465,286,261 naval appropriations bill, disregarding six amendments proposed by pacifists. This number is an increase of $174,879,098 over last year's naval expenditure. Congressman Maverick's small navy faction in the House attempted to postpone the $14,500,000 plan to build new ships, but ultimately failed. Congressman Cooper then requested that the naval construction plan be postponed until January 3, 1936, which was also rejected. Maverick told the House that the United States building new battleships might hinder world peace. However, a government spokesperson stated that the new ship construction expenses were insignificant and not worth mentioning. The bill has been submitted to the Senate, and it is rumored that there will be no resistance from the Senate. President Roosevelt has silently approved the plan to increase naval personnel.

<h3 id="e41">Germany Builds Twelve Small Submarines, German Political Circles Vehemently Deny It <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>(London) News has reached London that Germany is currently building several small submarines, reportedly twelve of them, each weighing 250 tons. Whether there are other constructions is still unknown. The British government is currently in communication with its ambassador in Berlin and will consider the impact of this news on the Anglo-German naval talks scheduled for the second week of May. The Treaty of Versailles prohibits Germany from building submarines. If Germany has indeed done this, it would be another act of violating the treaty. (Reuters, 27th)</p>
<p>(London) According to news from Berlin today, German political circles are vehemently denying the construction of small submarines. An official from the Ministry of National Defense said that this claim is based on wild speculation and that they do not wish to comment on it. Germany currently has no submarines under construction, and there are no plans to build any, as all naval issues will be discussed at the meeting in London soon. (Reuters, 27th)</p>
<h3 id="e42">French Air Ministry Statement: Truth About Aircraft Patrolling Borders, Germany Also Issues Statement <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>(Paris) According to political circles, the French authorities' announcement that they will use aircraft to patrol the restricted areas of the northeastern border of France seems to have caused a misunderstanding. Some believe that France will force German aircraft flying over French territory to land. The French Air Ministry stated that this view is completely wrong. An official from the Air Ministry stated today that the French government does not want to shoot down aircraft during peacetime. The government's purpose in sending aircraft to patrol the borders is to identify the country to which the aircraft that cross the border belong. If necessary, legal or diplomatic procedures will be taken. (Reuters, 26th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) A senior official of the Ministry of Aviation today denied to the Associated Press reporter that German aircraft had crossed the French border. However, the official stated that some German training aircraft had indeed crossed the border in the past, but it was due to bad weather and entirely accidental, and they had quickly reported to the police. The official added that such border crossings are common in areas similar to the Franco-German border. Yesterday, the French authorities actually announced that, due to external reasons, they were prepared to take strict air defense measures. However, the statement issued by France this afternoon was much more moderate. (National News Agency, 27th)</p>

<p>(Paris) It is expected that the Franco-Russian Mutual Assistance Treaty will be signed as soon as Soviet Russian Ambassador to France, Potemkin, receives new instructions from Moscow. At the same time, French Foreign Minister Laval declared in a speech here today that if the treaty becomes an unrestricted treaty of military mutual assistance according to the direction advocated by the French Communist Party, it will plunge the French people into war. He will never sign such a treaty. The agreement he negotiated with Moscow aims to prevent war, not to provoke it. (Reuters, 26th)</p>
<p>(Moscow) According to reliable sources, as a result of the four-day meeting of the People's Committee, Litvinov has issued new instructions to Soviet Russian Ambassador to France, Potemkin. According to political opinion, this move should enable the early establishment of the Franco-Russian agreement under negotiation. (National News Agency, 26th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Soviet Russian Ambassador to France, Potemkin, spoke with French Foreign Minister Laval for an hour last night at the French Foreign Ministry. When leaving the Foreign Ministry, the Russian ambassador told reporters that the fundamental points of the two countries' agreement had been agreed upon, but a few details had not yet been resolved, so several French legal experts will be invited to participate in the next meeting. The next meeting has been scheduled for today, and political circles generally believe that the negotiations will be completed today or tomorrow. (National News Agency, 27th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The Soviet People's Committee held a meeting yesterday to discuss the views adopted on the Franco-Russian agreement. This afternoon, Soviet Russian Ambassador to France, Potemkin, called on Foreign Minister Laval to present these views of the Soviet Union. In principle, the Franco-Russian agreement has already been agreed upon by France and Russia, but regarding the mutual assistance section, the Soviet Union advocates automatic assistance in the event of aggression, while France advocates mutual assistance only within the framework of the League of Nations Covenant and the Locarno Treaty. Therefore, some difficulties have arisen in drafting the final text of the Franco-Russian agreement. It is generally believed that Potemkin's visit to Laval will bring appropriate new suggestions to resolve these difficulties. Potemkin and Laval will also meet with legal experts again tomorrow. In this case, the text of the Franco-Russian agreement should be agreed upon in the near future. (Havas, 26th)</p>
<h3 id="e44">German Newspaper Criticizes MacDonald's Remarks, Accuses Him of Obscuring Facts and Hindering Peace <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>(Berlin) A semi-official political and diplomatic commentary was published today, titled "MacDonald's Lesson," which criticized MacDonald's recent article "Germany and Peace." It stated that although MacDonald's peace movement has failed for several years, he still regards himself as a European peacemaker and often criticizes Germany. Although MacDonald claims that he is not speaking for the Treaty of Versailles, his fundamental position is to maintain the situation created by the Treaty of Versailles. Before Germany announced conscription, MacDonald, in the White Paper he signed, pointed to Britain's increase in military spending as a result of Germany's actual military build-up. Now, MacDonald recognizes Germany's law of March 16 as an obstacle to peace. MacDonald also knows that future history will not completely blame Germany, but it is regrettable that he cannot clearly point out the cause of the failure. Germany's military build-up came long after the failure of MacDonald's disarmament plan. Unfortunately, MacDonald reversed the cause and effect, claiming that Germany's rearmament was the reason for forcing other countries to expand their military. His claim that Germany's military equipment is larger than other countries is even more inconsistent with the facts. Germany's withdrawal from the League of Nations was the result of the complete failure of the disarmament conference and Germany's inability to obtain equality. If MacDonald obscures these facts and speaks, it will only increase the obstacles to peace and make MacDonald's hopes for Germany's cooperation in disarmament negotiations even more difficult.

<p>(Berlin) Today, all German newspapers unanimously published an article by Propaganda Minister Goebbels entitled "The Meaning of May Day," which stated that May Day in 1933 was the day the Nazi Party seized power, May Day in 1934 was the day when all physical and mental laborers in Germany united under the rule of the Party, and May Day in 1935 was the day when the freedom of the German nation and the sovereignty of the country were revived. On this day, all German people should express their gratitude for the Führer's announcement of conscription on March 16, because from now on, the unity of all German nationals will be a fact that informs the world, and there will be no more contacting others to attack their own nationals. Führer Hitler is the representative of this new national. His words are the voice of 65 million Germans. He is the spokesperson of Germany. He not only defends the honor of Germany, but also insists on the equality of the country. Finally, he will not hesitate to use all his strength and sacrifice to build peace in Europe. (National News Agency, 27th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The Morning Post received a report from a reporter stationed in Berlin, saying that according to well-informed sources, Führer Hitler will deliver a speech at the Tempelhof Airport on May 1, Labor National Day, "explaining German foreign policy and proposing to continue international negotiations based on the London Declaration of the British and French governments on February 3." (Havas, 27th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) May 1 is Germany's National Labor Day, and celebrations will be held throughout the country. Propaganda Minister Goebbels issued a notice today, which stated that "May 1, 1935, will be the anniversary of Germany's restoration of national sovereignty. The celebration of May Day this year should make the world aware that the decision of March 16 is the decision of the German people. Hitler is the mouthpiece of the entire nation, and his aspiration is to restore Germany's honor and equal rights, but he is also willing to work hard and sacrifice to build Europe." (Havas, 26th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Today is the 41st birthday of Hess, Hitler's representative. Congratulatory telegrams from party departments and people of all kinds are pouring in like snowflakes, indicating that Hess is indeed one of the most popular figures in Germany today. Hess was born in Alexandria, Egypt. His father was a businessman. During the war, he served as a volunteer in the 1st Bavarian Infantry Regiment and was wounded in the Battle of Verdun in 1916. He was wounded again in Romania in 1917. After that, he was transferred to the air force. After the war, he studied history and economics at the University of Munich. Later, he was wounded again in street fighting with the Spartacus League, which occupied Munich. He joined the Nazi Party in 1921 and became a leader in this movement.

<p>(London) Former Greek King George arrived here from Paris tonight. According to an interview with a Reuters reporter, he had no knowledge of the rumors in Paris that a powerful Greek conference there requested him to restore the throne of Greece. At the same time, according to news from Athens, the restoration of former King George is not impossible. Deputy Prime Minister General Kondylis issued a statement today saying that inviting former King George to return to the country to restore the throne is not an issue at present, but if the majority of the Greek people wish to do so, a public referendum may be held to decide. The issue should be resolved entirely by the people. (Reuters, 26th)</p>
<p>Athens: Officials announced today that a referendum will be held soon to decide whether Greece will restore the monarchy. Minister of the Army Kondylis said that the Greek people can calmly decide whether they wish to continue to be citizens of the republic. At the same time, former King George, after visiting Paris, arrived in London with his guards and denied convening a secret royalist conference in Paris, but declined to comment on the Greek restoration movement. According to unofficial news, the Greek reform of the political system has nothing to do with diplomacy, so the major European powers are not concerned. Observers say that King George of England and the Greek King get along very well, so Britain will not prevent him from restoring his power. (National News Agency, 27th)</p>
<p>Athens: News from abroad that Greece will soon restore the monarchy has caused anxiety here. Therefore, last night, Army Chief of Staff General Kondylis issued a statement to representatives of foreign newspapers, stating that the republican system implemented on March 25, 1934, was recognized by all parties in Greece. Since then, there has been no discussion about changing the form of government. The general election for the National Assembly will be held soon. The government believes that the issue of the form of government should not become an issue of party struggle. If the votes cast by the people on the issue of the republic or the monarchy are unanimously in favor of restoration, the government will certainly implement the will of the people. If General Metaxas is determined to fight for this issue, the government will never interfere unless it endangers public safety. Furthermore, the turmoil caused by the recent riots has now subsided. The Greek people should be able to calmly consider this issue. If the majority of the people want to resolve the issue of the form of government in this way, the government is prepared to resort to a national referendum. (National News Agency, 27th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Although news from newspapers here stated that the deposed Greek King George participated in a secret meeting of the Greek royalists on his way from here to London, relevant parties have frankly denied this news. However, people on the King's side believe that the Greek general election on May 19 will be beneficial to the restoration of the monarchy. At the same time, people in this regard also said that if the Greek Constitutional Assembly advocates restoration, there will be no problem for the King to return to the country.

At that time, artillery teams will fire several rounds of salute in Hyde Park, and the Tower of London will fire cannons in response.

<p>(Berlin) Three more opposition pastors were arrested in Berlin today because they were close to foreign journalists and were in contact with the opposition of the Christian Church and the Catholic Church. The detention of these three pastors coincided with the civic conference of the Germanic Faith Movement, whose slogan is "Germany is the Only Holy Land." The leader of the association claimed to have one million believers. At the meeting, Professor Hauer and Marquis Liwenluo spoke in succession. Professor Hauer said that the German faith movement is an expression of the German soul. They firmly believe that God has expressed himself through the great leader of the Germans. They believe that Christianity is a danger to the unity of the people. When Marquis Liwenluo spoke, someone stood up to criticize him, and the crowd was in an uproar, fighting and attacking, causing chaos at the meeting. The police restored order after expelling the complainants. Liwenluo said that many people have left the church. Although they still have religious impulses, they are unwilling to return to Christianity. German believers demand freedom of thought, but reactionary Christians criticize them and regard them as communists or Marxists. (Reuters, 26th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) The Roman Pope's special envoy to Germany, Orsenigo, recently returned here from Rome and protested to Deputy Foreign Minister Buero over the German government's recent arrest and imprisonment of many Catholic priests and the Nazi Party authorities' support for the new pagan movement against a certain Christianity. The papal envoy made a protest to the German government over these two matters. In addition, the German government recently promulgated the Newspaper Guild Law, which strictly restricts church-published newspapers. Therefore, Orsenigo further requested the German government to explain what conditions a purely religious Catholic newspaper must meet in order to be allowed to be published. (Havas, 26th)</p>

<p>Madrid - The leaders of Spain's four major political parties, namely Radical Party leader and Prime Minister Lerroux, People's Action leader Robles, Agrarian Party leader Tafur Trascasa, and Liberal Democratic Party leader Álvarez, are scheduled to hold a meeting today to discuss the political situation. This meeting is considered important, and political figures believe it can clarify the political situation, so everyone is waiting and watching. Considering the current parliamentary situation, it is possible for the central faction and the right-wing coalition to form a majority party, but it is difficult for the central faction and the left-wing coalition to form a majority party. Both the right-wing Agrarian Party and the Liberal Democratic Party want to participate in the cabinet, and the number of cabinet seats will be based on the number of seats each party occupies in the parliament. This will be reviewed at today's meeting. However, the resolution will not be announced until a few days later, because the International Labor Day is approaching, and it would be inappropriate for a cabinet crisis to occur at this time.

<p>Changchun correspondence: The financial situation in the Northeast has recently become extremely panicked. The puppet organization has implemented a policy of prohibiting the outflow of silver dollars, but it has still not been able to reduce the degree of panic. Therefore, they have had to collude with traitors and Japanese and Korean ruffians to smuggle our silver dollars into the Northeast from within the customs. However, the degree of panic has not diminished. The puppet organization has come up with a whimsical idea, ordering the High Court and local courts to tally debt lawsuits. Most of these cases involve disputes over the price of puppet currency (i.e., inconvertible paper currency) and silver dollars. The puppet court then issued an unreasonable legal interpretation, stating that loans or sales matters of the puppet country's people should be based on the puppet currency. Even loans made before the establishment of the puppet organization, based on seven qian and two fen of silver dollars, can now be replaced with puppet currency. This is because silver dollars are the old currency system of the Northeast, which is also the current currency system of China. Silver dollars can still be used in commercial foreign trade, but silver dollars must never be used as the standard currency system within the puppet organization. The legal and financial circles have negotiated and compromised, prohibiting people from using silver dollars as the standard currency system with each other. Violators will be severely punished for disrupting financial order, and all merchants and people in various places will be notified to comply. From this, one can see the absurdity of the puppet organization and the extent of the panic due to the lack of silver. (Northeast News Agency)</p>

<p>Beiping correspondence: The Japanese are managing the Northeast, implementing an immigration policy on the one hand and carrying out aggressive economic encroachment on the other. The rumored Japan-Manchukuo joint transportation agreement is a key aspect of the Japanese policy towards Manchukuo.

At the time, Liu Zuo-zhou, the Chief of the First Security Regiment, along with County Magistrate Sun Rong-bin and the heads of various agencies, decided to increase the County People's Corps by 1,000 men. It was jointly decided that Liu Zuo-zhou would be responsible for organizing and commanding them, which yielded excellent results. Notorious bandit leaders such as Zhang Xi-wu and others were successively captured. This spring, with the eastern area pacified, the 1,000 newly added members of the People's Corps were reduced by 500, bringing the total number of the People's Corps to 2,000 to assist in bandit suppression. Now, Liu Zuo-zhou believes that 2,000 men is too many and places a heavy burden on the local area. On the morning of the 24th at 10:00 AM, he reconvened a meeting at the headquarters. More than ten people attended, including village corps directors Hao Zhen-shu, Li Fu-chun, First District Captain Ji Yao-xian, and Second District Captain Wu Yu-liang.

<h3 id="e110">Wang Lun Dies After Falling from Horse: Coffin Moved to Fayuan Temple, Prominent Figures Personally Attend Memorial Service <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>Beiping Dispatch: Wang Lun, Director of the First Bureau of the General Staff Headquarters and Deputy Chief of the General Staff of the Field Headquarters, suddenly fell from a horse in Zhongnanhai at 11:00 AM on the 23rd, sustaining injuries that ultimately proved fatal. He passed away at Xiehe Hospital, it is reported. Upon hearing the news, people from all sides expressed their condolences. After the body was washed and coffined yesterday morning (24th), it was immediately moved to Fayuan Temple outside Xuanwu Gate. Today (25th) marks the third day after his passing. Chairman He (Yingqin) of the Military Council and other important military and political figures personally attended the memorial service, showing immense honor. The various circumstances are recorded below:</p>
<p>Death from Horse Fall: Wang Lun had a routine of riding a horse for exercise every morning, circling around Zhongnanhai. On the morning of the 23rd at 8:00 AM, he was again riding along the coast of the South Sea with Hou Cheng, a senior staff officer of the Military Council, and grooms. When they reached north of Yongshun Ice Cellar, the horse Wang was riding suddenly bolted. Wang was unable to rein it in and was thrown off, his head hitting a stone projection by the roadside. The upper corner of his right eye was grazed, and he bled profusely. The groom and Hou Cheng quickly helped Wang up, but he had already lost consciousness and did not respond to calls. Hou and Wang's family members immediately transported Wang to Xiehe Hospital for treatment by car. Because the back of Wang's head was severely concussed and blood vessels ruptured, the treatment was ineffective, and he passed away at around 11:00 AM at noon.</p>
<p>Coffining Circumstances: After Wang's death, people from all sides deeply mourned the loss upon hearing the news. The body was moved from Xiehe Hospital to the ice room. For all funeral arrangements, Chairman He (Yingqin) of the Military Council allocated 5,000 yuan for funeral expenses and appointed Hou Cheng, Gao Sheng-yue, and aide Zhang Hong to be responsible for the arrangements. Wang's coffin was worth 1,180 yuan. The body was wrapped in silk wadding, and the burial garments were a blue Jing silk Zhongshan suit, with a matching cloth overcoat. Yesterday morning (24th) at 9:00 AM, Wang's family members went to Room 18 of Xiehe Hospital to supervise the coffining of Wang's body. Wang's wife cried bitterly on the floor during the coffining. Guo Qi-lin, Wang's old servant who had been with him for many years, was also in inconsolable tears. He Yingqin, accompanied by Shang Zhen and others, arrived at the scene at 10:30 AM to pay their respects. The coffining was completed at 12:00 PM.</p>
<p>Funeral Procession Route: After Wang's body was coffined, the coffin was carried out and covered with a coffin shroud in front of the main gate of Xiehe Hospital. The band of the Garrison Headquarters played mourning music by the roadside. Two companies of soldiers from the Garrison Special Service Battalion stood solemnly by the side to express their condolences. Wang's coffin was then carried by 64 pallbearers, with the band and soldiers leading the way. Chairman He (Yingqin) and other important figures walked in front of the coffin to escort it. Wang's son, Jing-Ya, carried the banner. A company of soldiers also escorted behind the coffin, followed by Wang's wife and the cars and carriages of the mourners, stretching for about a mile. The route passed through Shuaifu Garden, Wangfujing Street, Dong'anmen Street, Nanchizi, Tian'anmen Street, West Chang'an Street, Xuannei Street, Xuanwai Street, and finally to Fayuan Temple. Today (25th) marks the third day after his passing. Those from the military and political circles who attended included He Yingqin and his wife, Shang Zhen, Xu Ting-yao, Wang Shu-chang, Rong Zhen, He Jing-wu, Liu Yi-fei, Huang Jie, Guan Lin-zheng, Ji Yi-qiao, Shen Chang, Yu Jin-he, Shao Wen-kai, Cai Yuan, and approximately 200 staff members above the section chief level of the Military Council. Wang's younger brother, Liu Min (currently the director of the Fifth Army Hospital in Nanchang), after receiving the tragic news in Jiangxi, flew to Beiping this afternoon (25th) to oversee the funeral arrangements. It is scheduled to transport Wang's coffin back to his ancestral home in Ninghai, Zhejiang.</p>

<h3 id="e111">Xie Lin and Liu Hangchen Confer: Reorganizing Sichuan Finances. Investigation of Local Banknotes Completed, Reported to Ministry of Finance for Further Arrangements <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>Chongqing Dispatch: Over the years, the various armies in Sichuan Province have collected taxes on their own, leading to a very chaotic financial situation. Since the central government clearly ordered Liu Xiang to be responsible for presiding over provincial administration, the various armies have successively handed over the power to manage civil finances. After taking office, Liu announced that from this year onwards, land taxes would be collected once a year, the original tax bureaus would be abolished, a single tax system would be implemented, and he expressed his determination to do his best to reduce the burden on the people. In the future, improvements can be expected. However, due to the exhaustion of cash in Sichuan Province, public debt banknotes and paper money filled the market. Since the start of the bandit suppression campaign, military expenditures have increased sharply, and the financial situation has become extremely difficult. Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi previously telegraphed Liu Hangchen, the Director of the Sichuan Finance Department, to Shanghai to discuss the issue of reorganizing Sichuan's finances. He also transferred Xie Lin, the Secretary-General of the Central Bank, to serve as the special commissioner of the Sichuan Provincial Finance Department, to come to Sichuan to guide the establishment of Central Bank branches and to investigate and reorganize Sichuan's finances. Xie arrived last month and immediately consulted with Special Commissioner Chen Shao-gui, Finance Director Liu Hangchen, and others. As a result, in order to discuss reorganization measures, it was decided that the first step was to accurately know the current amount of financial circulation. Therefore, it was decided that Xie would start investigating local banks and the number of banknotes issued by their reserve depots, and then report the findings to the Ministry of Finance for further arrangements. At the beginning of this month, Xie personally went to the local banks and reserve depots to investigate. Yesterday, Xie told reporters that the investigation of local banknotes had been completed and jointly reported to the Ministry of Finance by Director Liu. How to reorganize is to be decided by the ministry. The report jointly submitted to the Ministry of Finance by Xie and Liu to clarify the situation of local banknotes in Sichuan is excerpted below:</p>
<p>"It has been found that the Sichuan Local Bank was established in 1934. It has issued various banknotes since then. On August 1 of the same year, the Sichuan Post-Rehabilitation Supervisor's Office ordered the establishment of the Sichuan Local Bank Exchange Voucher Reserve Depot, which was managed by nine banks, including the Bank of China, Juxingcheng, Shimin, Sichuan Commercial, Chuankang Development, Pingmin, Meifeng, Sichuan Salt, and Local, specializing in the custody of the funds of several banks. The banks and the depot were independent of each other and not subordinate to each other. At that time, the Local Bank transferred the one-yuan, five-yuan, and ten-yuan banknotes issued up to July 31 of the same year, totaling 5.63 million yuan, along with a 60% cash reserve, to the reserve depot for acceptance. However, the Local Bank subsequently handled the issuance of the Chengdu banknote, in addition to the issuance of subsidiary currency notes, on its own. The vouchers issued by the reserve depot were borrowed and used in 1932, resulting in a shortage of reserves. It has now been found that as of April 9 of this year, the total number of banknotes and cash reserves issued by the bank and the reserve depot are as follows: (A) Number of banknotes issued: (1) Main currency portion: one-yuan notes: 6,800,9,347 yuan, five-yuan notes: 3,728,607.50 yuan, ten-yuan notes: 20,800,3,364 yuan. It has been found that the bank and depot have regulations for exchanging half or three-quarters of damaged and incomplete banknotes. Therefore, the five-yuan and ten-yuan notes both have odd amounts. Chengdu local notes: 60,000 yuan, totaling 31,400,1,310.50 yuan. (2) Subsidiary currency portion: two-jiao notes: 216,877.20 yuan, five-jiao notes: 1,389,906 yuan, copper coin notes (issued by Wanxian branch): 618,568 strings, each yuan calculated at 8 strings and 997 cash, equivalent to 68,740 silver dollars, totaling 1,675,525.20 yuan. The total issued is 33,076,841.70 yuan. (B) Amount of cash reserves: (1) Reserve depot balance: cash 1,722,781.78 yuan. (2) Local bank balance: silver dollars 596,450.03 yuan, half-yuan coins 84,792.48 yuan, two-jiao coins 365,359.26 yuan, silver ingots 169,781.16 yuan, totaling 1,216,383.20 yuan. (3) Chengdu branch balance: silver dollars 60,000 yuan. (4) Wanxian branch balance: copper coins, etc., equivalent to 68,740 silver dollars. The total cash reserve is 3,067,904.98 yuan, which is insufficient by 30,008,936.72 yuan. The above main and subsidiary currency notes total 33,076,841.70 yuan. Besides the cash reserves of 3,067,904.98 yuan held by the bank and depot, there is a shortage of more than 30,008,900 yuan. However, both the bank and depot also have securities issued by the Sichuan Provincial Government as a guarantee reserve. This is the situation of the number of banknotes and reserve funds issued by the Local Bank and the reserve depot. As for reorganization, it is proposed to follow the original four measures, requesting the Ministry to borrow 33 million yuan from the Central Bank to be used to recover these banknotes. 550,000 yuan will be allocated each month under the provincial funds, totaling 26.4 million yuan in four years. After repaying the principal of 23 million yuan, the remaining 3.4 million yuan will be used as interest on this loan. The remaining shortage of cash reserves of more than 7,008,000 yuan should be supervised by the Finance Department to instruct the bank and depot to find ways to convert the original guarantee reserves into cash. If there is a shortage, the Finance Department will be responsible for supplementing it. Once reorganization begins, the recovered and unissued banknotes and printing plates will be transferred together for closure, so that all local banknotes will be completely consolidated and no more will be issued in the future. As for the 10 million yuan of local banknotes originally planned to be sealed, the remaining 5,871,000 yuan is currently sealed. The banknotes owned by the Chongqing silver industry association are temporarily deposited and sealed in the treasury as a clearing fund. According to the method, the silver industry association's joint treasury issues deposit certificates for the collected funds, which are circulated for clearing, and no cash banknotes can be withdrawn. The purpose is only to temporarily control the exchange limit. Therefore, this sealed voucher should be calculated in the number of issued banknotes and should not be deducted." (April 24)</p>
<h3 id="e112">Qingdao Commerce Declines: Money Supply Extremely Tight, Real Estate Unsold, Many Large Stores Closing <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>Qingdao Dispatch: Qingdao is a land and sea port with convenient transportation. In the past, its industry and commerce were exceptionally developed, and rents were high, not inferior to Shanghai. Since last year, affected by various economic downturns, it has suddenly shown a bleak scene, and rents have gradually fallen, no longer as unusually high as before. Since this spring, the various commercial industries have declined day by day. Because they could not bear the losses, stores that closed down one after another were heard of from time to time. On both sides of the various roads, city houses, which in the past even spending thousands of yuan on commission fees could not be obtained, are now mostly vacant. The decline of the market can already be seen. Xie Feng Cotton Cloth Store, Yicheng Hardware Store, Wenxingchang Iron Store, etc., are solid and wealthy merchants in this city. Last month, due to lack of cash flow, they closed down one after another. The losses of the three merchants amounted to more than 800,000 yuan. As a result, various banks and money houses were all wary and stopped lending, resulting in extremely tight money supply in recent days. Various merchants could not operate, real estate sales stagnated, and various industries struggled to maintain, forming a sluggish phenomenon, and closures were still heard of every day. Recently, in April, those who applied to close down included Zhengxingxiang, Tiandehao, Deyuantang, Xinchenghe, Liu Chengpu, Xianjihao, Yuhesheng, Zhenhua Printing Bureau, Donghuahao, Qianjuyuan, Gonghe Wood Shop, Jinfuchang, Yitaihao, and Yongxiandongji, etc. Fourteen of them were stores with strong capital and a long history in this city. They actually closed down one after another because they could not maintain it. If this continues, without finding a way to save it, the cold market will become even more unbearable. The number of stores that applied to close down in January, February, and March of this year is listed below: eleven in January, eighty-seven in February, one hundred and forty-six in March. There are no statistics for April yet, but it is around a hundred. In total, there have been more than a hundred closures since the new year, which is enough to show the poor state of commerce in this city. (25th)</p>
<h3 id="e113">Songjiang: County Chamber of Commerce Member Assembly <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>The County Chamber of Commerce held its fourth member assembly today (27th) morning. Two hundred and sixty-eight representatives from various industries attended. Sun Shi-heng, an executive committee member dispatched by the county party headquarters, and Xu Mo-jia, a section chief commissioned by the county government, attended the meeting to provide guidance. Representatives from various organizations also participated. Chairman Cai Zhong-yu presided over the meeting. After completing the required rituals, he announced the legal convocation of the fourth member assembly. After Sun, the party committee member, and others gave speeches, the important cases were discussed. There were thirteen cases, all concerning the interests of the commercial community. Temporary motions: (1) Chairman Cai Zhong-yu resigned from the positions of standing committee member and executive committee member, which was approved. (2) Organization of a commercial arbitration office was resolved. Nine adjudicators and three alternates were elected by ballot, as well as two investigators and one alternate. The meeting adjourned after the resolutions were passed.</p>
<h3 id="e114">Suzhou: Striving for Motor Fee Reduction Resolved <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>More than ten industry associations in Suzhou, such as silk weaving, have repeatedly sent representatives to petition the provincial government and the Central Construction Committee to strive for a reduction in motor electricity fees. The progress of this matter has been recorded in this newspaper. It is now learned that the Central Construction Committee felt that the motor electricity fees set by the Suzhou Electric Company were excessive. Two new measures have been specially formulated: one is a two-part tariff system, which stipulates that for monthly electricity consumption below 250 kilowatt-hours, the rate is 6.5 fen per kilowatt-hour; above 250 kilowatt-hours, the rate is 5.5 fen per kilowatt-hour. The other is a minimum consumption system, which stipulates that the rate is 1.4 yuan per horsepower per month; for monthly electricity consumption below 150 kilowatt-hours, the rate is 6.5 fen; within 250 kilowatt-hours, the rate is 5.5 fen; within 350 kilowatt-hours, the rate is 4.5 fen; above 350 kilowatt-hours, the rate is 3.5 fen. Users can choose one of these options. The Wu County Chamber of Commerce has been instructed to notify the relevant industry associations and the Electric Company to comply. According to the above measures, the Electric Company will suffer significant losses, with an estimated annual shortfall of 150,000 yuan. Users have expressed satisfaction with the above measures. As for the reduction in lighting electricity fees, a request was also made at that time, but the instructions of the Construction Committee did not mention it, so the request for a price reduction is still being submitted to ease the burden on users.</p>

<p>Tao Ruo-si, a teacher at the Huili Elementary School in Lili, had an affair with Wu Rui-zhen, a female teacher at the same school. In May 1930, they engaged in intercourse in the school dormitory. Later, in April 1932, Tao Ruo-si married Shen Cai-hua. Fearing exposure, Tao asked Wu to commit suicide. Wu was indignant and filed a lawsuit alleging seduction and rape, instigation of suicide, and requested the county government to handle the matter according to the law. After a court hearing, it was ruled that Tao Ruo-si, with the intention of adultery, seduced a woman under the age of twenty and was sentenced to one year of imprisonment. For the crime of instigating another person to attempt suicide, he was sentenced to three years of imprisonment. The sentences will be served concurrently for a total of three years and six months, with deprivation of civil rights for five years.</p>

<p>Hong Gui, an inspector from the Central Party Headquarters, arrived in Jiading from Taicang at noon on the 24th. On the same day, he was accompanied by Lu Lin-zhu and Zhou Gong-li from the county executive committee, and Pan Zhi-jiu from the supervisory committee, to inspect the Education Bureau, the Central People's Education Center, the Xuhang Cooperative Demonstration Area, etc. In the evening, he convened the staff of the county party headquarters to give instructions.

<h3 id="e117">Conspiring to Obtain Rewards by Falsely Accusing Good People of Being Thieves <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>In the case of the theft of more than 7,000 yuan from the Jiading Bank in this city, since the incident occurred, the bank immediately offered a reward of 1,000 yuan for the arrest of the perpetrators. After multiple investigations by the Public Security Bureau, there was still no clue. A man named Hu Wan-chun outside the South Gate, who had served as a water police cabin chief, volunteered to the bank, claiming to have leads in Shanghai. He first asked to borrow 100 yuan for travel to Shanghai to handle the case. In order to urgently solve the case, the bank lent him the money in full. Hu then bought Jiang Xiao-gouzi, who was about to be released after serving a prison sentence for theft in Jiading, and instructed him to confess, instructing him to recognize someone as a tip. At the same time, he requested that the County Public Security Bureau prepare a document to dispatch police to Shanghai Zhabei to arrest a certain person, A. After being brought to the county for questioning, A claimed to be raising pigs for a living in Shanghai, and tilling twelve acres of land to make a living, and had no theft behavior. He also did not know Jiang Xiao-gouzi. Director Chen believed that Jiang Xiao-gouzi had confessed to planning the case with A, but did not participate in the implementation due to some reason. Afterwards, A would have shared dozens of yuan of the stolen money with Jiang Xiao-gouzi, so A and Jiang Xiao-gouzi should know each other. Therefore, Director Chen ordered A to stand in a crowd, and Jiang Xiao-gouzi was brought to identify him. Unexpectedly, Jiang could not point him out at all. Thus, the situation of trying to obtain rewards by falsely accusing good people of being thieves was completely exposed. Hu Wan-chun was ordered to be arrested and brought to the bureau. Hu could not cover it up. Director Chen immediately transferred the two criminals, Hu and Jiang, to the county government for handling according to the law.</p>

<p>Spring rains have continued for months, and farmland and spring crops have suffered damage, especially wheat. It is expected that the yield per acre will not exceed four or five dou.

<p>Yan Shen-yu, the magistrate of this county, has been in office for more than two years. He has made remarkable achievements in local administration and various construction projects. The people of the whole county also love and respect him very much. Yan requested to resign due to illness last winter, but was persuaded to stay by the provincial authorities. He overcame his illness and continued to serve the public. Recently, Yan has suffered from insomnia. Even if he works a little too hard, he gets dizzy. As county administration is important and cannot bear the burden, he telegraphed the provincial civil affairs department yesterday, requesting permission to resign so that he can recuperate.</p>

<p>The Public Security Bureau received a tip-off last night that twenty-one members of a newly organized ruffian gang were operating a large-scale gambling den at No. 23 North Street, Tonghui Bridge, outside the North Gate, profiting by skimming off the top. Their organization was extremely tight, with sentries posted all around. The public security officers were requested to arrest them. Inspectors Ge and Qian led the police in plain clothes at around 1:00 AM, taking a detour through the West Gate. At that time, a large group of 40-50 gamblers were calling out bets, happily engrossed. Therefore, they were caught off guard. When they saw the police arrive, they fled in all directions. The police immediately took action and arrested twenty men and women, including the gamblers Chen Jin-si, Tang Ji-sheng, and Xu Liu-shi, along with the gambling equipment and gambling money of 177 yuan.

<p>Recently, the County Construction Bureau learned that the Tongda Steamship Company, the Limin Steamship, the Hongsheng Steamship Company Hongsheng, the Xinan Steamship Company Huifeng, the Datong Steamship Company Xilu Class, were competing for business, arbitrarily changing the sailing times, and reducing ticket prices, vying to solicit passengers and overcrowding the ships. Not only were passengers unable to keep track of the schedules, but it was also easy for accidents to occur and it caused the Northeast and Xinjie two steamship companies to repeatedly requested correction, but they were not followed. Yesterday, in order to mediate the dispute, the Construction Bureau specially invited representatives of the above six steamship companies, including Chen Xiang-chun, to the bureau for a meeting. It was decided that: (1) The sailing times, passenger capacity, and stopping points along the way for each steamship must be strictly in accordance with the schedule attached to the applied for navigation license from today onwards, and no changes are allowed. (2) Ticket prices for each section should be fairly determined by each steamship company according to the mileage, and displayed to passengers. The Construction Bureau should be notified for record, and no arbitrary increases or decreases are allowed after verification. (3) Calling and soliciting passengers by each steamship company is absolutely prohibited.</p>

<p>The dredging of the Huangtian Port South Canal project, from the port to the South Gate section, will be completed in a few days. The section from South Gate to Qingyang is still under construction. Now, because seedling transplanting is approaching and farmers will soon be busy, the canal project should be completed quickly to avoid affecting agricultural activities. It has now been decided to first complete the clearance of the northern section and then open the dam. Yesterday (26th), Xiao Kai-ying, the chief secretary of the Construction Department, and Chen Zhi-ding, the director of the general engineering office, came to Cheng. In the afternoon, they inspected the project around the port outside the North Gate with County Magistrate and Chen Bing-zhang from the three departments and others.

<p>Yan Dian-nan, the captain of the Nantong County Police Force, lost more than a hundred firearms while suppressing bandits in the eastern countryside and harassed the people. He was dismissed from his position and investigated by the province. This case was designated for trial by the Wu County Local Court.

<h3 id="e124">Jiaxing Municipal School Teachers' Strike <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>The Jiaxing education funds have been in arrears for more than nine months. Recently, with the approval of the province, provincial public bonds of 27,800 yuan were designated as educational savings. The county has now received them from the province. At that time, the principals of each school requested that the public bonds be used to pay off old debts, and the county government agreed. Recently, the county government stated that education funds could not be collected and planned to use the public bonds to offset the April expenses. The old debts were refused, causing all teachers on the 26th, together with the principals, to submit a general resignation and implement a strike. The principals were also unable to cope and allowed the students to self-study in the classrooms. At the same time, they telegraphed the provincial government's education department and the county party headquarters to request relief, and issued a declaration seeking assistance from all sectors. The students of each school were also concerned about their studies (especially the graduating students of all levels who were anxious). That afternoon, they went to the county government to petition for transfer certificates. On the 27th, the students of each school went to school as usual. The teachers, at a meeting at the commercial school on the evening of the 26th, after the head of the education section, Shen Da, and the principals tried their best to retain them, agreed to temporarily take on the responsibility of managing the children, but still stopped classes and waited for a resolution. The parents of the students, seeing this, were about to question the education authorities. After County Magistrate Wang returned to the county from the province on the 27th, he only agreed to use the public bonds to pay off old debts and refused to issue any more, resulting in a stalemate and escalating the situation. The district primary schools also went on strike on the afternoon of the 27th due to the arrears of seven months of funding.</p>

They were rescued from the pile of mud, all with head wounds and bleeding. The Public Security Bureau sent an ambulance to take the injured to the Municipal Hospital for treatment.</p>

The supervisors are Li Ming, Yu Hede, Bei Zuyi, Lin Kanghou, Xu Chenmian, Xie Mingxun, and Qin Zuze, totaling seven people.</p>
<p>Original Text of the Oath: All the directors, supervisors, president, and vice presidents stood solemnly in front of the podium, each raised their right hand to read the oath. The oath read: "I solemnly swear that I will恪遵 Sun Yat-sen's will, obey the Party's principles, abide by national laws and regulations, be loyal and diligent in my duties, save expenses, never hire useless personnel, never engage in private fraud, and never accept bribes. If I violate this oath, I am willing to accept the most severe punishment from the Party."</p>
<p>Wu's Speech: Wu Tiecheng, the representative of the Central Executive Committee, delivered an instruction speech, saying, "Today, the president, directors, and supervisors of the Central Bank are taking the oath of office. I am very honored to be appointed to participate in the ceremony. The Central Bank is a national bank, and it is also the highest authority in the country's financial system. Under the leadership of former President Song and President Kong, and all the directors and supervisors, the foundation of the national bank has been firmly established, and its credit has been remarkable. This is a fortunate thing for our country's finance. This time, many directors and supervisors have been added, all of whom are responsible leaders in society, undoubtedly adding fresh troops. Its future development can be predicted. I sincerely wish the Central Bank a boundless future."</p>
<p>Chu's Speech: Chu Minyi, the representative of the National Government and the Executive Yuan, then delivered an instruction speech, saying, "Shanghai is the hub of China's industry and commerce, so the government specially established the Central Bank here. Since its establishment, it has been carefully managed by former President Song and President Kong, and to this day, it has established the status of a national bank. All its businesses are thriving and are not inferior to the national banks of Eastern and Western countries. Today, President Kong, Vice Presidents Zhang and Chen, and all the directors and supervisors are taking office by order, and I am extremely honored to be ordered by the National Government and the Executive Yuan to supervise the oath-taking ceremony. I believe that in recent years, our country's agricultural production has declined, and industry has withered, resulting in a lack of improvement in various trades. Imports have reached an alarming amount. Recently, the outflow of silver has become even more serious. In the face of the domestic and international economic situation, our national bank must respond to the needs of the times and take appropriate paths. All of you are either financial experts or banking giants. In this environment, I hope that you can work together, proceed steadily, restore the stability of the country's finances, and provide a basis for all industries and businesses to achieve the expectation of completing the task of the national bank. This is what I want to say to you in addition to my congratulations."</p>
<p>Guest's Congratulatory Speech: Guest Lu Xuepu delivered a short congratulatory speech, saying, "The Central Bank is the bank of banks. Since the silver issue has become increasingly serious, the Central, China, and Communications Banks have worked together to make efforts, and its success can be predicted. Today, the president, directors, and supervisors of the Central Bank are taking office, and I am here to congratulate them. I wish the Central Bank ten thousand years, the three presidents and vice presidents Kong, Zhang, and Chen ten thousand years, and all the directors and supervisors ten thousand years."</p>
<p>Kong's Reply Speech: After the representatives of the Central Party Headquarters and the National Government delivered their speeches, President Kong replied on behalf of all the directors and supervisors, saying, "Today, all the directors, supervisors, president, and vice presidents are taking office by order and holding an oath-taking ceremony. We are honored to have Mayor Wu specially sent by the Central Party Headquarters, Secretary-General Chu specially sent by the National Government, and guest Lu Xuepu and others deliver speeches. I would like to express my gratitude on behalf of all the directors and supervisors. The establishment of the Central Bank is based on Sun Yat-sen's teachings. When Sun Yat-sen was in Guangdong, he organized the Central Bank for the convenience of revenue and expenditure and economic construction. The former president, Mr. Song Ziwen, worked hard in the midst of storms, so the Central Bank has achieved its current results. Mr. Song's contribution is great. Recently, in order to consolidate the financial sector and revive industry and commerce, the Central, China, and Communications Banks have implemented cooperation, which is a cause for celebration. I have limited knowledge, so in addition to one vice president, I have added another vice president, Mr. Zhang Gongquan, to take the post. Mr. Zhang has a glorious history and experience in the financial sector, so the Central Bank will become more and more developed in the future. The consolidation of social finance and the revival of industry and commerce will also advance with it."</p>
<p>Joint Meeting of Directors and Supervisors: The oath-taking ceremony concluded after half an hour. All the representatives and guests stepped forward to shake hands with President Kong, Vice Presidents Zhang and Chen, and all the directors and supervisors to congratulate them. Then, the first joint meeting of directors and supervisors after the increase in capital was held in the directors' room, chaired by President Kong Xiangxi. The ceremony was performed as usual. The new and old directors and supervisors were immediately introduced, and the bank's business after the capital increase was reported. No motions were submitted for discussion. After the meeting, a banquet was held in the auditorium to celebrate.</p>

<h3 id="e127">The American Economic Survey Mission Held an Expert Meeting with the Chinese Side Yesterday Was Invited to a Tea Party by Finance Minister Kong The Reception Office Will Also Hold a Tea Party Today <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the American Economic Survey Mission held an expert meeting with Chinese leaders from all walks of life yesterday afternoon to discuss Sino-American commercial issues. The head of the delegation, Forbes, participated in the Pacific United Conference. In the afternoon, he went to Finance Minister Kong's grand tea party. More than 300 Chinese and foreign guests attended. This afternoon, the head of the reception office, Zhang Jia'ao, and all the executive committee members hosted a tea party at the Huxi Villa on Hongqiao Road. The Central News Agency reporter specially reported the details as follows:</p>
<p>Expert Meeting Held by Both Sides</p>
<p>Yesterday at 12:30 PM, members of the survey mission and Chinese leaders from all walks of life held an expert meeting and had lunch on the second floor of the International Hotel. The Chinese experts who attended included Xu Xinliu, Liu Dajun, Chen Liting, Zhang Naiqi, Gu Jiga, Jin Luqin, Nie Lusheng, Li Zufan, Li Zufa, Zhang Xiaomei, Guo Bingwen, Shao Huihua, Cai Wuji, Kong Shie, He Dequan, and Pan Guangjiong. Xu Xinliu, director of the motion group, was elected as chairman. The members of the survey mission included Carroll, Dilingham, Connick, Rogers, Raymer, Shifley, Hutchins, Speth, and Wexby. More than 30 people from both sides jointly discussed various commercial and economic issues between China and the United States. The members of each delegation expressed their opinions in order to reach a common understanding on each issue and then use this as a starting point for discussion. The discussion lasted for two hours. The head of the delegation, Forbes, did not attend because he went to the Capital Hotel to participate in the Pacific Federation Conference. He was represented by the deputy head of the delegation, Carroll.</p>
<p>Welcome Reception by the Pacific Federation Conference</p>
<p>At the same time, the Pacific Federation Conference in Shanghai held a meeting at the Capital Hotel on Fuzhou Road and invited Forbes to lunch. During the meeting, Kong Xiangxi, the president of the conference, gave a speech introducing the importance of the American Economic Survey Mission's mission, which is not only to develop trade between China and the United States, but also to have a great relationship with merchants from various countries in Shanghai. As far as Mr. Forbes himself is concerned, he is a diplomat, banker, and philosopher. After Kong finished the introduction, Forbes stood up and gave a speech, which is as follows: "According to my experience over the years, I deeply feel that the Pacific coast will become the largest market in the world. Looking at the Asian coast, there are China, Japan, the Dutch East Indies, and India, which have a large population. On the east coast, there is the United States, which has a vast territory, abundant resources, and a sparse population. In addition, the people of that country are developing natural resources and working hard in commerce, so the trade of the Pacific countries will definitely be comparable to the Atlantic Ocean in the future. Looking at it historically, a large population is enough to increase trade. This is an inevitable example. Now that the population on both sides of the Pacific Ocean is increasing day by day, its commerce will undoubtedly become more and more developed. If we want to study the commerce between China and the United States, we can only calculate the trade between the United States and other places, such as the Philippines, Japan, and Honolulu, as a percentage, and then compare it with the population of China. Then we believe that the trade between China and the United States must have a very large development potential. I mentioned today that the progress of transportation in the Pacific Ocean, in addition to agile steamships, also includes telephones, wireless telegraphs, and airplanes, which are enough to make the two sides of the Pacific Ocean closer and generate more and more beneficial trade. The purpose of our delegation is to make historical and factual investigations into the causes of commercial prosperity and decline, study its origins, and finally compile a report based on existing principles to develop commerce, reduce its obstacles, and make suggestions for new businesses. We will start compiling the report on the way back. Before the report is compiled, it is difficult to express any opinions. What is most noteworthy about our visit is the internal transportation in China. I traveled in China for a long time in 1932 and saw that transportation was mostly dependent on manpower and animal power, and there were few roads through the fields. However, today there are 47,000 miles of roads. Other buildings, such as railway passes, have also made great progress. As for the municipal administration of Nanjing, its progress is particularly admirable. All of this is enough to make the inland and coastal and river commercial ports have developed transportation and convenient freight. Other aspects, such as irrigation, afforestation, and river management, have also achieved satisfactory results. This is really something we are happy about and is enough to be a prelude to a new era in China. The aviation equipment in China recently and the people's attention to aviation. I have traveled by air many times in China. The most satisfactory one was this Sunday's flight from Beijing to Shanghai, which took less than an hour. Regarding the independence of the Philippines, I want to say something. The Philippines has been under American rule for more than 30 years. Now that the American Congress has allowed it to be autonomous, although its sovereignty still belongs to the United States, all its internal affairs will be returned to the people of the Philippines. The president will also be elected by them. The United States only sends one governor to inspect its administration. In the recent five years, the trade between the United States and the Philippines will remain unchanged except for a few restrictions. However, five years later, until the ten-year trial period before the Philippines is completely independent, the products shipped from the Philippines to the United States must be subject to the treatment of new tariffs. It is found that this matter has a profound impact on the Far East. During this trial period, the people of the Philippines must find new markets to replace the United States and impose a very heavy burden on their industries. We have been invited to visit China and Japan this time, which has made our efforts have the hope of satisfactory results."</p>
<p>Finance Minister Kong's Tea Party Welcome</p>
<p>Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi held a tea party at his private residence garden on West Ainsworth Road at 4:00 PM yesterday to welcome the American Economic Survey Mission.

<h3 id="e130">Shanghai Minsheng Yarn Factory Closes <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Minsheng Yarn Factory was founded in 1920, entirely funded and operated by Chinese people. It has more than 1,000 workers and a paid-up capital of 700,000 yuan. It is a joint-stock company. When it was first founded, it had two departments: cotton spinning and wool spinning. The company's authorities, in view of the increasing imports of foreign goods and the loss of money, added weaving machines, dyeing, and finishing machines in 1931 to resist foreign goods and slightly reduce the drain. The products include cotton yarn, wool yarn, woolen cloth, various cotton and wool blankets, etc. The annual production is 9,000 bales of yarn, 40,000 bolts of cloth, 20,000 cotton and wool blankets, and 300,000 military blankets are welcome to be used. Unfortunately, the capital is too small. In recent years, the addition of wool weaving, dyeing, and finishing departments has cost hundreds of thousands of yuan, and the financial tightening has made it difficult to turn around. After a temporary shareholders' meeting, it was resolved to declare liquidation, and lawyers Wu Linkun and accountant Xi Yushu were entrusted to handle the liquidation matters. The company's authorities, in view of the difficult livelihood of the workers and in order to revive national industry, are still trying to raise new funds everywhere, and there is hope of resuming work in a short time.</p>

<h3 id="e131">The Special District City Federation Requests the Implementation of Small Loans Relief Greatly Expected by Industry and Commerce as the Fourth Quarter Approaches <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai First Special District Citizens' Federation sent a letter to the Banking Association yesterday, saying, "To the point, according to the sub-federations of our association, one after another, it is reported that the factories, stores, etc. under the jurisdiction of the trade union have repeatedly stated that the market situation has suddenly declined and the economy is becoming increasingly difficult to maintain. Now that the fourth quarter is approaching, they are finally at a loss. According to reports, the banks have jointly organized a 5 million yuan small industrial and commercial loan. At this critical moment, we rely on practical relief. If this small loan can be realized as soon as possible, it can still save the desperate situation. If we continue to hesitate and procrastinate, then the overall situation will be lost. Even if there are good methods, not only will it be impossible to remedy the situation, but it may even lead to a mutual end. The situation is urgent, and we cannot help but look forward to it like clouds and rainbows. We have asked to report to the association. The market situation in Shanghai is depressed, and the people are struggling to make a living, which is obvious to all. Among them, the most difficult and difficult thing is the sluggish industrial and commercial business, the expenses are as usual, the commercial goods are piled up like mountains, and the workers are as numerous as the tide. The capital is exhausted on weekdays, and we can still deal with the silver and money industry, but now everyone sweeps the snow in front of their own doors, and the door to business is also interrupted. It is impossible for industry and commerce not to stop their business. Under the continuous closure, Shanghai, the leading commercial port in our country, will never return to its prosperous day. However, it is recently heard that our government is also determined to rescue industry and commerce, using 15 million yuan as a mortgage loan and 5 million yuan as a credit loan, which has been ordered by the Ministry of Finance to the Central, China, and Communications Banks to discuss methods and actively implement it. However, in addition to the direct benefit of the silver and money industry, there is no benefit to the ordinary industry and commerce. If it is said to be a roundabout adjustment, it is even more difficult for distant water to quench the immediate thirst. Therefore, all industries and businesses hope that the small industrial and commercial credit loan initiated by the Banking Association and the Local Association last time will be completed as soon as possible, so as to help them out of their predicament. The matter concerns the overall situation, and it is both important and urgent. We earnestly request that your association work hard to promote its early completion, which is not only the great virtue of a part of industry and commerce, but also all the citizens of Shanghai will benefit from it. We should send a letter accordingly, and we hope to see the situation of the loan release of the small loan on the same day." Respectfully to the Shanghai Banking Association,</p>

<p>Yesterday (the 27th) was the tenth day of the Shanghai preview of the London International Exhibition of Chinese Art. As the closing date approached, visitors purchased tickets to enter and view, making the venue extremely crowded. Moreover, there were visitors from afar, some from Fujian and some from Hubei, who did not hesitate to travel long distances to visit Shanghai, which is sufficient to show the strong interest of Chinese people in art in recent years. Others came from various counties in Jiangsu Province, and there was no day without them. Statistics show that yesterday's visitors numbered nearly three thousand. The news heard yesterday is summarized as follows:</p>
<p>Continued Submission of Antiquities for Display</p>
<p>The Archaeological Group of the Institute of History and Philology of the Academia Sinica has continued to send ten selected archaeological examples, as well as two photographs, which were displayed yesterday in the seventh exhibition room of the association. These antiquities are even better than those previously sent by the group, so many visitors stopped in front of the display cases to carefully examine them.</p>
<p>Rubbings of Inscriptions on Anhui Bronzes</p>
<p>The Anhui Provincial Library previously sent four bronze vessels, including a Zu tripod and a Ding cauldron, for display. Two of them each have inscriptions. The inscription on the Ding cauldron reads "Chu King Hui... Temple cast Zhi Ding, Minister Gong... Chang Yi," twelve characters in total. The inscription on the Zhi cauldron reads "One cast, the format is King Gou Liu Nai Wei Zhi," nineteen characters in total. The library has printed rubbings of both and attached explanatory texts, specially submitting them to the association for display and exhibition. The association yesterday (the 27th) replied to the Anhui Provincial Library that it had handled the matter according to the items listed in the letter.</p>
<p>Explanation of Selected Archaeological Examples</p>
<p>Explanations of selected archaeological examples include oracle bones used for divination, oracle bone script, deer head carvings, stone knives, stone axes, and bone tools. Arrowheads, Ge halberds, spears, and axes, and nine other categories have been previously published in this newspaper. We are now publishing the explanations of bronzes, fragments, bronze molds, bone carvings, ivory carvings, and stone carvings to give readers a complete picture. (Ten) Bronze Fragments: With the demise of the Yin Dynasty, the Zhou people looted all of its important vessels. Therefore, no important ritual vessels have been found at the Yin Ruins. However, the selected fragments are sufficient to prove that the bronzes of the Yin people were all cast, and also to prove the variety of types of bronzes that were cast. (Twelve) Bone Carvings, Ivory Carvings, and Stone Carvings: The artifacts of the Yin Ruins that best represent the artistic concepts of the Yin people are bronze molds, bone carvings, ivory carvings, and stone carvings. The bronze molds have been mentioned above. Now, five kinds of bone carvings, ivory carvings, and stone carvings are selected to show their carving and inlay techniques. (End)</p>

<p>It is noted that the breach in the Yellow River at Fenglou Shitouzhuang two years ago remained unclosed for several months until the middle of February last year. Kong took over the responsibility on February 15 and the closure was completed within three weeks. This time, the breach in the Huayang Dyke Jiugulu area of Guantai was worked on by the Hebei River Affairs Bureau for five months, but instead, the Guantai breach was scoured to 30 meters, taking away 80% of the river's flow. The central government, recognizing that the situation was escalating and concerned the safety of the three provinces of Hebei, Shandong, and Henan, urgently sought relief measures. If this was not done, a new course would be altered and the locality would be devastated. Kong was ordered to take office at a time of great danger. Fortunately, he was supported by sufficient funds from the central government, transportation assistance from the railway bureau of the Ministry of Railways, and communication assistance from the telegraph bureau of the Ministry of Communications. In addition, the three provincial governments and county governments provided hired boats and carts for procurement, and the people were happy to contribute. Everyone worked diligently as if they were facing a great disaster together, so that the closure was successfully announced in less than two weeks and the flow was stopped in five days, completing the work of cutting off the flow. Incompetent as Kong is, there is nothing to be proud of. He was only attentive and diligent in his duties. However, there are some things that can be recorded: (A) Regarding the procurement and transportation of materials, 1. Ships: More than 400 ships were hired, from Wuzhi in Henan to Lijin in Shandong. It was not easy to gather them on the difficult waterways of the Yellow River. 2. Carts: More than 1,000 carts were hired from the counties near Lanfeng, with funds provided, to transport stones from Lanfeng Station to Chenliukou, opposite Guantai, and then transported by manpower with small carts. 3. Willow branches for brushwood: Each county along the river was responsible for purchasing 10 million catties. From Zheng County to Puyang, special personnel were stationed at the Huayuan, Liushui, ... Liuyuan, Chenqiao, Chenliu, and Lanfeng crossings to collect materials, issue tickets, and receive payments based on the tickets. The group then dispatched ships to transport the materials to the work sites, sailing upstream when the wind was from the north and downstream when the wind was from the south, using the wind direction to increase the speed of transportation within hundreds of miles. 4. Stones: One part was purchased from the Dahu quarry in Xuzhou, Jiangsu, and one part was purchased from the Heshangqiao Xingshan quarry. The Longhai, Pinghan, and Jinpu railways jointly allocated cars and transported them day and night. The North Ning Railway also allocated locomotives to assist. The daily volume of mountain transport gradually increased from hundreds of cubic meters to 1,100 cubic meters. Although the working stones could barely be used, the transportation by car and boat took time. There was no way to meet the needs in terms of mileage. Therefore, boats were used from Gongxian to transport them, and stones were borrowed and purchased from the Henan River Affairs Bureau to assist in the transportation by land and water. This was able to meet the demand. Before and after, 10,000 cubic meters were transported to Lanfeng and Guantai. 5. Lead wire and hemp bags: Both were purchased from Shanghai. One hundred tons of lead wire and 250,000 hemp bags were transported in batches from Shanghai to the construction site. After the closure, there were still 40 tons of lead wire and 50,000 hemp bags being transported to the construction site for storage in case of a major flood. 6. Other ramie, etc., were purchased and transported from Hanzhong and other places to the construction site, reaching 200,000 to 300,000 catties. In addition to those used, the value of the existing materials is more than 100,000 yuan. (B) Regarding the progress of the project, 1. Defensive engineering: At the beginning of the group's management, while concentrating on the collection of various materials, it designed to protect the existing sweeping sections of the east and west dams. The west dam had a draft of more than 10 meters. The east dam had a draft that was deep and sloping inward. Therefore, boulders and hemp bags were thrown to protect the dam feet of all the dams facing the river and behind the river, and willow stone bundles were used to protect the dam feet. The soil compartments between the main and side dams were filled with willow-wrapped soil bags to consolidate the inside and outside of the two dams, so that the mouth of the breach was blocked. 2. Water-permeable willow dam: It was anchored with large willows and pressed into the water, but its power could only slightly divide the flow and could not silt up. It was originally intended to make a substantial water-diverting dam, but due to the need to block the mouth of the breach with stone materials, there was not enough to allocate, so it was not made. Only temporary floating boats were added to make the heavy anchors fall and increase the diversion of the flow. The success of the closure still lies in the willow stone pillows in the form of jujube kernels, which were taken by the construction of the willow stone bundles. 3. Blocking and closing work: First, the existing soil dams of the east and west dams were protected with willow stone pillows to a considerable degree of consolidation. Two boats were placed at the Dragon Gate facing the river and tied to the anchor boats facing the river. The pillows were tied to the anchor boats at the end facing the river and slowly lowered to the bottom with a winch. The work was carried out day and night and was finally successful. The east and west dams, facing the river, behind the river, and at the mouth of the breach, used a total of 1,660 willow stone pillows, each about 4 zhang long and 1.5 chi in diameter, weighing about 6,000 catties. This shows the greatness of the project. 4. Closing work: After the closure was completed, 40,000 earth bags were thrown on the river-facing side of the Dragon Gate to make willow sweeps with alternating willow and earth bags. A total of six batches were pressed, but they could not reach the bottom of the water. Each batch was about 1 zhang long. The volume occupied by the 40,000 hemp earth bags and the six batches of closing willow sweeps, plus the stones thrown on the surface of the water, is enough to prove that the depth of the river-facing pit in front of the Dragon Gate is at least 6 or 7 zhang. It can be known that it is by no means the rumor that the Liu Dam can be successfully padded. According to reports, the rumor that the willow dam was successful in silting up and blocking the breach was reported by Qi Shouan, Director of the Hebei River Affairs Bureau, in the name of the chief of the engineering office. During the tense time of the group's breach closure project, Director Qi asked for leave of absence on the pretext of official business, and claimed that he had to start work on the Huayang Dyke Jiugulu area and could not take care of both. He requested to resign from the concurrent position of chief of the engineering office. The group was forced to submit a request for approval, and on April 6, after his leave expired, the group sent Zhu Chang'an, the section chief of the bureau, to continue to take over the acting position, separately notifying the records. However, until the closure was completed in November, he suddenly came to the job reinstatement to indicate that he had been dismissed on the 13th to report to the group, the group's engineering vote approved, the group believes that personnel who have been approved to resign, still use the group's engineering office in the name of, to report to the various departments, there are overstepping their powers, please strictly prohibit the group, etc., has been notified on record, his report has not taken effect, but the entire Guantai work, all by Rong presided over planning, know the most thoroughly, fear that the outside world will be misunderstood, special notes, You Nan to say, Guantai closure was originally a cut-off work, because after Lou flow, Huayang to the nine shares of the road area, will be the mouth of the breach, you can take soil, easy to block the restoration, the group to grab the closure, day and night, sleepless and rest, because the speed of the closure, one can make the people of the three provinces do not mistake the spring ploughing early to return to their hometowns, two can make the Huayang to the nine shares of the road and the Jin Di, all easy to construction, but after the closure, it has been more than half a month, it has been found that the Huayang to the nine shares of the road area, are now dry, repeatedly by the meeting to allocate funds to urge the river bureau to start work, but unexpectedly Yan delay is not in accordance with, yesterday see the newspaper, and false words of employees leaving Guan, can not start, it is not known that at this time to repair the original embankment, and Guantai has not been closed before, very different, with pure soil work, for the easiest in the project, also imperative, not to mention the required funds, has been transferred by the Economic Commission a few days ago, the river bureau is responsible, the people's lives, why still pretext not to go to work, long delay is so, sincerely hundred rope does not understand Cloud.</p>

Li Dachao presided over the meeting and Chen Shuo took the minutes. The chairman's report stated that the recent progress of the Weiqiu teams has been very tense and the results have been excellent. This is due to the efforts of the captains, vice-captains, team members, and all sectors of the city. It is hoped that the external affairs secretaries will think of more ways, directly and indirectly, to assist in the progress. Xiao Youmei, captain of Team 296, plans to hold a concert and transfer all proceeds to the aviation patriotic fund. All methods have been handed over to Zhang Yuliang, Chen Shuo, Zhu Shengyang, Bao Lengxue, etc. to prepare for the aircraft model exhibition, which is scheduled to be held around May 15, so that citizens can recognize the importance of aviation and patriotism. In addition to providing materials from aviation agencies and other places, we should collect as much aviation-related material as possible. The restaurant industry has slightly increased the aviation patriotic donation. A meeting was previously convened, and it has now been decided to convene a second meeting at 5:00 PM on the afternoon of the 30th of this month, after which the date will be determined and the fundraising will begin. There are many households in the city that have installed radios. It is planned that each radio station will broadcast aviation patriotic news at a specific time every day to make citizens understand the meaning of aviation patriotism and enthusiastically join in. In addition, each hotel will increase the aviation patriotic donation. The hotels have not worked hard to collect the donation, but after this expanded persuasion, they are now working very hard. Before the Captain General Office expanded the aviation patriotic donation, the transport brick and tile industry association resolved to collect an aviation patriotic donation of 20,000 yuan. After the fundraising method was decided, the brick and ash industry association convened an executive supervisory meeting to pass the transport industry's methods in accordance with the original plan. At 4:00 PM the day before yesterday, the responsible representatives of both sides still held a joint meeting in the Dachantou Building to discuss and amend the fundraising method.

<h3 id="e137">Real Estate Association Publishes the Process of Negotiating Water Prices <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>For the past four or five years, the public concession's tap water has repeatedly increased in price. Since the conversion from the package water system to the water meter system two years ago, water fees have skyrocketed, and users cannot afford to pay them. The Real Estate Association Kui Yanfang, ... Yaoting, Shen Jixuan, Li Bohan, Li Shuxiong, and others protested, and the Public Concession Bureau organized a water price committee, with Feng Bingnan as chairman, who held a fair position. The water meter fee was calculated with a discount, and the water price was fair, benefiting users. Recently, the association, based on the original agreement to increase the surcharges in 1930, requested that the Public Concession Bureau reconsider the water price, since the silver price has reached two shillings. The correspondence is recorded below:</p>
<p>Letter to the Public Concession Bureau</p>
<p>Letter from the Real Estate Association to the General Office of the Public Concession: Respectfully, the Shanghai Water Company requires landlords of neighborhoods to pay a water meter deposit, which is adding to the difficulties of the real estate industry at a time when the real estate industry is declining. We hereby protest and ask your bureau to negotiate with the company to cancel this provision. The deposit is a guarantee, and its cancellation will have no impact on the company's finances, but it will benefit the real estate industry. Also, the surcharge on tap water that was increased in 1930 should be reviewed, since the silver has reached two shillings. We ask your bureau to consider this matter so that the package water fee will return to 6% of the previous amount. It seems that the discount method set by the company since April 1 last year is not applicable to non-water meter areas that still use the package water fee.</p>
<p>Reply Letter from the Public Concession Bureau</p>
<p>Reply Letter from the Public Concession Bureau to the Real Estate Association: (1) Your letter of March 16 regarding the protest against the Shanghai Water Company's deposit for water meters and the request to reconsider the water surcharge has been submitted to the board of directors for review. (2) Respectfully, your letter of March 16 regarding the protest against the Water Company's collection of water meter deposits and the proposal to revise the 25% surcharge in non-metered areas. Landlords of neighborhood houses may request the Water Company to install sub-meters and sign water contracts with tenants to alleviate the difficulties of landlords. This is a reasonable move, as landlords are not responsible for excessive waste by tenants. However, landlords have never used this provision, except when the number of sub-meters saved exceeds the interest on the water meter deposit. In small houses, the installation of sub-meters is not economical due to the low water fees, and some are even a loss, which must be compensated by all users. Your association's request would only increase this loss and is difficult to implement. As for the second paragraph of the letter, there are no non-water meter areas in the concession.</p>

<h3 id="e141">Shanghai Begins Cholera Vaccination Program May 1st, City Health Bureau Entrusts Vaccination Sub-stations <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>As the weather warms, cholera bacteria easily multiply. The city's cholera prevention work has been prepared by the Municipal Health Bureau and will begin free cholera vaccinations on May 1st. In addition to forming vaccination teams to be sent to various locations, it has also entrusted well-known hospitals in the city as vaccination sub-stations in order to make it widespread. Any citizen who wishes to receive this preventive vaccine can go directly to the Health Offices in the areas of Hu Nan, Jiang Wan, Wu Song, Gao Qiao, etc. under the bureau's administration, as well as the Municipal Shanghai Hospital, Zhabei Clinic, the Municipal Central District Simple Clinic, or various sub-stations for free vaccination. It is reported that the bureau has a mixed cholera-typhoid vaccine, which can prevent both cholera and typhoid fever after vaccination, which can be described as killing two birds with one stone. It is also said that if there is a group of more than thirty people, they can write to the bureau to arrange for personnel to be sent for vaccination regularly. The known vaccination sub-stations are as follows: Southeast Hospital of the Nanshi Military Camp, Xin Pu Yu Tang on Pu Yu West Road, Pingmin Charity Clinic on Da Wang Miao Street, Women and Children's Hospital on Fang Xie Road, West Gate, Nanyang Hospital on Xiao Nan Men, Shui Shen Ge Clinic on Xiao Nan Men Street, Municipal Public Education Center on Wen Miao Road, Taizhou Hospital at the intersection of Xin Qiao Street and Min Guo Road, Pu Shan Hospital at No. 1043 Xin Min Road, Lian Yi West Hospital at the Han Qiao Tu of North Station, Red Cross General Hospital on Haig Road, Red Cross Second Hospital on Cade Road, Xin Zha Road, Red Cross Third Hospital on Wai Ma Road, Shiliupu, Hu Nan Civilian Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital at No. 707 Zhonghua Road, Da Nan Men, Labor Hospital on Xiao Sha Du Road, Tong De Hospital at No. 1, Lane 67, Tong Fu Road, Sino-German Hospital on Fu Xi Road, Shanghai Epidemic Hospital opposite the Great World on Tibet Road, Emergency Epidemic Hospital on North Tibet Road, Hu Xi Commune on Robert Road, Pudong Hospital on Lan Ni Du, Children's Charity Clinic on Wu Zhen Road.</p>
<h3 id="e142">Rice Prices Soar Daily, Tianjin and Hebei Suffer Wind Disaster, Inland Demand High, Authorities Studying Remedial Measures <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>Since last year, our country has been affected by drought, resulting in poor harvests. Rice merchants in this city have ordered foreign rice from foreign merchants to regulate the market. More than four million bags of foreign rice have arrived in port one after another, of which about three million bags have been sold. About one million bags will arrive soon. However, recently the inland demand for rice is very strong. According to last month, more than 1.1 million bags were sold. Now, the total of those arriving and those in stock is only more than 2 million bags. However, the new grain will not be available until a few months later, and the foreign rice can only last for more than two months. Therefore, although it was at the end of April a month ago, the price of rice not only did not decrease, but also increased. Now, the area of Tianjin and Hebei has suddenly suffered the impact of wind disasters, and food prices have soared. Most grain merchants hoard and hoard, unwilling to sell, so the price of rice will inevitably rise, causing panic among the people for food. The authorities will also study remedial measures.</p>
<h3 id="e143">Wei Tingrong Case, Two Kidnappers Withdraw Appeal, After Judge Explains Original Judgment, Two Bandits Suddenly Realize and Request Withdrawal of Appeal <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>On July 24, 1929, in the case of the kidnapping of Wei Tingrong, former commander of the French Concession Volunteer Corps and Chinese director of the French Municipal Council, the French-Chinese Bank, and the owner of the Yuan Tai Foreign Goods Company, the French police arrested the bandit gang members Zhu Jingcheng (also known as Xiangfeng, 37 years old this year, from Huaining, Anhui, former member of the Anhui Finance Department), Chen Zhongheng (also known as Wang Kui, 35 years old, from Wenzhou, Zhejiang, former pharmacist), and Tang Shiliang (36 years old, from Songjiang). The three were interrogated and sentenced by the former French Public Concession to five years of imprisonment, and after the expiration of the term, they were sent to the inland government for interrogation. The three prisoners were detained until February of this year, when the five-year term expired. The Second Special District Prison transferred the three prisoners to the Second Special Court, requesting a review. After Judge Qiu Huan-ying conducted the final interrogation, he sentenced Zhu Jingcheng to seven years of imprisonment for instigating kidnapping for ransom, and Chen Zhongheng and Tang Shiliang to six years of imprisonment each for helping kidnapping for ransom. The number of days of detention before the judgment was determined to be one day of imprisonment for every two days, and the number of days in prison was considered as execution. Unexpectedly, after the verdict was announced, Zhu insulted the judge in court for unfair judgment. After Judge Qiu reported the information to the president, Zhu was transferred to the procuratorate for interrogation and ordered to be returned to custody pending investigation. The details have been reported in the newspapers. Now, after receiving the judgment, the three prisoners detained in the detention center, except for Tang Shiliang, who gave up the appeal and has been sent to prison to continue serving his sentence, Zhu and Chen expressed their dissatisfaction with the review judgment and hired lawyers Zhang Shizhao and Peng Yuanxun to file an appeal to the Third Branch of the Jiangsu High Court. With the approval of the Third Branch of the High Court, the presiding judge Guo Dezhang, together with Judges Xiong Ping and Wang Cheng, and Prosecutor Zhang Zongru, specially opened a full deliberation court for interrogation. They also summoned the victim Wei Tingrong and the accomplices Tang Shiliang and Cai Weicai, who were executing their sentences in prison, to testify. Lawyer Yao Zhaodi represented the police department in court. After the court opened, the appellants Zhu Jingcheng and Chen Zhongheng were brought to the court. First, they were asked about their age, address, and occupation. Then, they were ordered to state the reasons for their appeal against the judgment. According to Zhu, the reasons for the people's appeal are very sufficient, but now they are unwilling to appeal and request permission to withdraw the appeal in court, preferring to suffer in prison for another two years. When asked about Chen, he said that he was very confused and unclear about the current judgment. The judgment stated that the principal offender was only sentenced to seven years of imprisonment. I am an accomplice and have already had my sentence reduced by one-half. Why am I still sentenced to imprisonment? On this point, I request the court to explain. Judge Guo verified the confession and explained to Chen that according to the law on punishing bandits in kidnapping cases, he should be sentenced to death. According to the amnesty regulations, the sentence is reduced by one-half, and he should be sentenced to life imprisonment. After further investigation, you are an accomplice, and the sentence is reduced by another two-thirds. The criminal law stipulates that you should be sentenced to six to twelve years of imprisonment. The original trial was based on these points and reduced the sentence repeatedly, only sentencing you to six years of imprisonment. If you think the six-year sentence is too heavy, you can appeal now, but whether the original trial's sentencing is light or heavy can only be clarified after the trial. There is no way to know whether your sentence is light or heavy now. Chen listened and said that after the court's explanation, he understood and was unwilling to appeal, requesting permission to withdraw the appeal. The official then said to the two prisoners that now that you want to withdraw the appeal, the original sentence will be final and you will not be able to appeal again in the future. You should consider it carefully. The two prisoners said that they would not appeal again. At this point, the court ordered the witnesses Tang Shiliang and Cai Weicai to be brought to the court and informed them that today they were being brought in for interrogation because of the appeal case of Zhu Jingcheng and Chen Zhongheng. Now that Zhu and Chen have withdrawn their appeals, there is no need to interrogate you any further. After the announcement, Zhu and Chen were ordered to be returned to the detention center to wait to be sent to prison for execution. Cai and Tang were sent back to prison. Wei Tingrong was summoned to the court and informed that the purpose of summoning you today was to ask you about what happened at that time. Because Zhu and Chen have returned to appeal, there is no need to ask you any further. You can go back. Wei listened and retreated, and the court adjourned.</p>
<h3 id="e144">Dong Jia Du Ferry Account Disputes <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>The ferries at various wharves along the beach in the Nanshi area of this city, such as the Shiliupu Pier and the Baitou South Pier, have been successively converted into ferries and towed by small ferries, which is convenient for travel and greatly benefits the public. However, the ferry at Dong Jia Du does not have small ferries to tow, and its ferries are still operated by two or three boatmen using manpower to carry passengers day and night. The number of people traveling to and from Pudong and Puxi is very large and never interrupted. In the event of strong winds and rapid tides, it is extremely dangerous and should be converted into a ferry to avoid all dangers. However, the ferry owners do not plan to do so and continue to do their own thing, which is regrettable. Recently, the leaders of the ferry, Zhang Genliang, Chen Jinbiao, Wang Zhisheng, and others, were sued by Zhang Linhai, Ji Hegui, and others to the simple court of the local court because the accounts they handled were unclear, requesting the court to order them to hand over all account books and funds in full in order to respect public funds. The court has opened a court for interrogation and ruled that Zhang Linhai is allowed to take back the takeover, and the litigation costs are also borne by Zhang Genliang and others. Now, because the defendants do not comply with the judgment, they only transfer a part of the books, and all the accounts have not been verified clearly. Therefore, yesterday, Bei Zhang Linhai filed a petition with the court for execution and requested to recover the litigation costs. After the court received the petition, it approved the dispatch of bailiffs to execute the judgment.</p>

<p>Sheng Zecheng, son of Sheng Xingsun, a former Qing Dynasty palace protector, previously mortgaged the base title deeds of Lianzhu on Avenue Edward VII and Yichang Road to Lu Shaotang, a giant land merchant. The initial mortgage price was 300,000 taels, and then it was increased by 20,000 taels, totaling 320,000 taels. However, Lu re-mortgaged it to Hengjiu Qianzhuang without obtaining Sheng's consent, obtaining a price of 750,000 yuan. Recently, Hengjiu Zhuang sued Lu in the First Special District Court because Lu failed to redeem it on time. When the mortgaged property was about to be executed, Sheng Zecheng learned of it, believing that it would hinder his ownership. Therefore, he hired lawyer Xu Shihao to sue Lu and Hengjiu in the civil court of the First Special District Land Court, requesting the court to confirm that the ownership of the base on Avenue Edward VII and Yichang Road belongs to Sheng Zecheng, and Sheng prepares a price of 447,552 yuan, four jiao, four fen, and five li to redeem it. He requested the court to rule that Hengjiu should not auction or sell the above-mentioned property. Yesterday afternoon, Zhang Qinglan took over the fourth civil court for interrogation and ordered a change of date for the hearing.</p>

<p>The notorious robber Lu Caixing, from August of last year to February of this year, colluded with accomplices and used weapons to rob a large amount of property in the Public Concession, as many as four times, and shot and killed people and fled. The case was discovered and arrested by detectives Sun Aizhong and Zhang Youming of the Huishan Police Station. His accomplice Yang Jicheng, from Shaoxing, who was hiding at No. 9 Kunming Road, was also arrested and sent to the First Special District Court for interrogation. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Wu Zehan conducted a trial in the second criminal court. Lawyer Li Zhishan of the工部局 (Shanghai Municipal Council) stated that (1) at 11:00 am on August 21 last year, the defendant Lu Caixing colluded with accomplices to rob the Chen Baoying military uniform shop at No. 31, Lane 220, Gongping Road. Chen happened to be out. He threatened his wife, saying that he must hand over the silver dollars, otherwise he would kidnap your two biological children. The car is already parked outside the door. In a hurry, she paid a bank draft of 500 yuan to let them rush to receive it and notified the thieves by telephone. Before leaving, she threatened not to report to the police, otherwise the whole family would be killed. Therefore, Chen did not dare to report to the police when he returned home. Only the coachman Zhang Asi came to court. When questioned by Lu, he admitted that Zhang Shunqing had initiated the plan and went with Lu Ahui, Hou Gao, and Qiao Fu, with two pistols. He received 70 yuan after the incident. According to the coachman Zhang Asi, many bandits came at that time, asking if Mr. Chen was there and wanted to make military uniforms. They immediately took out guns and threatened to keep silent, saying that they were helping and looking for valuable items. They planned to kidnap the two young masters. After giving the bank draft and receiving the money, they fled in a hurry. The defendant was at the scene, holding a pistol, etc. (2) At 7:00 am on November 19 last year, the robbery of the Ye Rongjun military uniform shop at No. 20, Lane 171, Yuanfang Road failed. The defendant and Ye fought each other, and the copper basin and felt hat fell off. He shot and seriously injured him, killing him. After the case occurred, the military uniform shop closed down, and his wife, Mrs. Dai, and shop assistants all returned home, so they could not be summoned. The defendant admitted to shooting and performing at the scene in the police station. At that time, a felt hat of the defendant was seized and presented for inspection. Lu confessed that what he said in the police station was untrue. Because I committed many robberies, I was sentenced to a long-term imprisonment. I heard that robbers in prison cannot eat enough and suffer all kinds of pain. It is better to admit it and be shot early to avoid suffering piecemeal. I tried to commit suicide several times in the police station, but could not get my wish, so I admitted it directly. In fact, I did not hear about this case (3) At 1:00 pm on December 15 last year, he colluded with the second defendant Yang Cheng to rob the Zhang Zhiqing iron factory at No. 18, Lane 355, Broadway, of silver dollars and clothes. They still felt it was too little and forced him to hand over a large amount of property with a gun. The victim Zhang was afraid of being harmed and gave a Shanghai Commercial Bank draft of 700 yuan. After a fellow member was sent to collect it, he also replied by telegram and left. When questioned by Lu, he confessed that Zhang Shunqing had initiated the plan and went with Lu Ahui, Hou Gao, Yang Jicheng, etc., and received more than 100 yuan after the incident. Yang also recognized that Zhang had invited him to get the money and was on par with Lu. The victim did not come, and the apprentice Xia Hua testified that he saw four robbers invading at the time, three of whom had pistols, and it was true that the above-mentioned clothes and silver notes were robbed. (4) At noon on February 15 this year, Lu colluded with Xuezhi to go to No. 40, Pingge Lane, Lane 239, Avenue Edward VII, planning to rob the Lu family of Red Pills. They took the pistol worn by the Si Ge Bu Ten Chunjin in the lane and blew the whistle wildly. They panicked and fired a shot, but missed and fled. Lu admitted that Lu Ahui had initiated the plan. The place was the residence of Lu Chunfa, the king of Red Pills. Zhang Shunqing, Fu Lao Touzi, and others entered the house. Suddenly, he heard the sound of a whistle. Lu Ahui fired a shot to show his power, and I also fired a shot into the sky and fled out the door. The Si Ge Yu Chunjin testified that Lu had fired at me to harm my life. Fortunately, I squatted down to avoid it, and the glass window was shattered. Lawyer Li further stated that the investigators had previously seized two shell casings in the house of Ye Rongjun at No. 171, Lane 171, Yuanfang Road, and two shell casings in the Lu family at No. 40, Lane 239, Avenue Edward VII. One of them was the same. Therefore, Lu had a lot of research on the shooting of Ye Rong Europe and America. This case is requested to be postponed again. The shell casing was fired from the same pistol. Wu Bao ordered the two defendants to be returned to custody and reheard at a later date.</p>

<p>Xu Quanqing, from Liyang, is 35 years old and currently runs the Sanduo Scenery Company at No. 779 Beijing Road with others, earning a good income. His wife Xu Chen Fuzhen had a son, Jin Yao, 17 years old, and a daughter, Jin Feng, 13 years old, all of whom live in the countryside with their in-laws. Xu has been in Shanghai for more than ten years and had an affair with a woman surnamed Pan, living together as if they were husband and wife. At first, he still sent household expenses, but recently his attitude has changed frequently, ignoring his parents, wife, and children, and not giving them a penny. He once planned to divorce his wife, but failed because she did not agree. Now, Xu Chen Fuzhen, because of the years of famine in the countryside and the severance of alimony from her husband, cannot maintain the livelihood of her family. Forced by desperation, she entrusted lawyer Xie to file a lawsuit with the First Special District Court, suing Xu for alimony. The court approved the petition and opened a civil court on the fourteenth yesterday afternoon, presided over by Judge Peng Shi. The plaintiff did not appear, and her lawyer appeared in court to state her intentions, saying that the plaintiff had previously requested legal aid due to poverty. According to the defendant Xu Quanqing, I am one of the shareholders of Sanduo Scenery Company. I am responsible for painting and other positions, and I can earn two or three hundred yuan a month. I married the plaintiff when I was 17 years old. After having children, I came to Shanghai for more than ten years and have never returned to my hometown. I heard that there is a grocery store in the countryside. Because my wife has indecent behavior, I have been living with a woman surnamed Pan in Shanghai for twelve years and have also had children. Xu Hongbao said that he is 54 years old and lives in his hometown. The defendant is my son. He previously asked me to come to Shanghai to testify and ordered me to lie in court about everything. Because I did not comply, he kicked me out of the house. Last night, I temporarily lived with the Qi family. He now lives a prosperous life, and we are extremely difficult in the countryside. He does not care, etc. The court then ruled that both parties should go out to reconcile. If the reconciliation fails, the hearing will be postponed to the afternoon of May 8.</p>

<p>In Changqiao Port in the southwest of this county, at about 1:00 am the night before last, a patrol boat of the Water Patrol Team of the Municipal Public Security Bureau was patrolling in the port. Suddenly, a small boat came head-on, and its appearance was suspicious. The water police ordered it to stop for inspection. Unexpectedly, the small boat was indeed a bandit boat. Feeling guilty for a moment, they opened fire. The water police were caught off guard. One of the water police, Qian Guilin, was hit in the vital point, injured and fell into the cabin, and died instantly. The other water police suddenly heard the gunshots and fought back, opening fire in return. The bandit boat retreated while fighting. As a result, two of them were captured. Yesterday morning, the team prepared a letter and submitted it to the Procuratorate of the Local Court to send personnel for inspection. After receiving the letter, the court commissioned Prosecutor Tang Ruxiu in the afternoon to lead Inspector Xuan Zhiming to the countryside to verify that Qian Guilin had died from a gunshot wound to the vital point. He filled out the form and ordered him to be coffined and buried pending instructions.</p>
<h3 id="e151">Abandoning a Dying Adopted Daughter-in-Law, Origin of the Female Corpse on Jufu Road, Wang Libao and Others Detained Pending Investigation <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>A nameless female corpse, about thirteen or fourteen years old, was found abandoned on wasteland opposite No. 160 at the intersection of Route des Soeurs and Rue Amiral Courbet, French Concession, at 10:00 am on the 23rd of this month. The French police reported the incident and sent detectives to transport the body to the autopsy office. They reported to the Second Special District Court, which commissioned Prosecutor Wang Ren to conduct an autopsy with the forensic doctor and found that the deceased had died from measles symptoms during her lifetime. Because no family members could be found, he ordered Tongren Shop Yuantang to hand over the body for photos and burial on behalf of the family. On the one hand, the French police sent detectives to investigate and arrest the corpse-throwing criminal to be brought to justice for interrogation. Now, under the close investigation of French Police Inspector Henry and Inspector Jin Jiulin, it was learned that the deceased was the adopted daughter-in-law of Li Liu, the concubine of Wang Libao, a native of Anhui, who lived at No. 607 Route des Soeurs. Before her death, Wang carried the girl out and abandoned her. Therefore, detective Zhou Bingcheng and detective Li Liansheng rushed to the address at 4:00 pm the day before yesterday and arrested Wang Libao (39 years old, business shop) and Li Liu (33 years old, native of Anhui). Together with the related second wife, Li Liu (50 years old, native of Anhui), they were taken to the police station. According to Wang's confession, he ran a shop in the home of an American named Wei Bao (transliteration) at No. 628 Route des Soeurs and lived at No. 607 on the same road. The deceased was a child bride, named Xiaozhen Baozi, who was 13 years old this year. She had worked as an amah in the home of a Westerner named Ma Sui and specialized in taking children to Sun Dajie. She fell ill with measles on the evening of the 19th of this month. She lived for two days, which was inconvenient. On the 21st, I rented the back building of No. 607. At 4:30 am on the 23rd, the illness became more serious. I intended to send her to the hospital, but when I reached the intersection of Jufu Road, the girl's illness worsened and she fainted, so I threw her down, etc. The police chief ordered them to be detained and sent to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court yesterday. According to the police lawyer Gu Shouxi's statement of the case, the defendant and others were arrested for abandoning a person to death. The police station still needs to investigate and requested a postponement. They will file a lawsuit after the investigation is completed. After reviewing the report, Baishi Li Changnian briefly questioned the defendants and ordered them to postpone the hearing until May 2. The defendants were returned to custody.</p>

<h3 id="e159">Shanghai Literacy Education Committee Promotes Literacy Education Propaganda Outline <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>(1) Propaganda Goals</p>
<p>(1) Explain the pain of illiteracy and the convenience of literacy, as well as its relationship to the country and society, so that the public knows the importance of literacy education, rises up to support the work of this committee, literate people are willing to bear the responsibility of persuasion, publicity, or teaching people to read, and illiterate people are willing to receive literacy education and enter the literacy schools run by this committee.</p>
<p>(2) Make the public aware that the literacy education movement promoted by this committee is not just a simple literacy education, but a patriotic movement that combines literacy education, common sense guidance, and civic training, so the public must enthusiastically support and actively participate.</p>
<p>(3) Make the public aware that the current methods of literacy are divided into two types: one is remedial education in school, and the other is remedial education outside of school. Under the first method, this committee has decided to establish 220 literacy schools starting from July 1st, with a total of 1,320 classes (postponed in the concessions), forcing illiterate people to attend school in batches for one hour each day, for a period of two months. Under the second method, this committee has requested that the Shanghai Party and government organs stipulate by order that all Party members and school students have the obligation to teach people to read. Illiterate people who have real difficulties and cannot attend school are allowed to find their own teachers or be introduced by this food to be filled by the above personnel, receive textbooks, and study at home, waiting for this committee to convene a test after a certain period of time. If the test passes, this committee can also award a graduation certificate.</p>
<p>(4) Make the public aware that handling this literacy education must start with investigation. Therefore, this committee will dispatch a large number of investigators to investigate illiterate people door-to-door between May and June, so as to teach students according to their aptitude in the future. However, door-to-door investigation is quite difficult, and we hope that the public will assist and facilitate it, and must not make things difficult or misunderstand. If you are willing to widely publicize and persuade verbally, this committee will feel greatly benefited.</p>
<p>(5) Create a warm and strong reading atmosphere, at least make the public aware that this city will force all illiterate people to receive literacy education starting from July 1st this year. If there are illiterate people who do not know how to cherish themselves and are unwilling to learn characters, this committee will impose a fine or labor service as punishment, and after one year the Qing Municipal Government will deport them.</p>
<p>(2) The Significance of Literacy Education</p>
<p>The significance of literacy education is very important. The following is a summary of the main points: (1) Regarding the individual: The average number of illiterate people in our country is more than 80%. These people cannot write letters, cannot keep accounts, cannot read newspapers, do not know the postings on the walls, do not understand the announcements of the official offices, and do not understand the general trend of the world. Having eyes is equal to having no eyes, and the pain is truly unbearable.</p>
<p>(2) Regarding society: The element of social evolution is knowledge, and the bridge to obtain knowledge is writing. Therefore, if you want to spread knowledge, you must first teach writing, and if you want to obtain knowledge, you must first know writing. Therefore, if you want society to progress, everyone must be literate.</p>
<p>(3) Regarding the people: Our national rights are becoming increasingly low, and the national crisis is serious. If we want to revive the nation, we must first awaken national consciousness and inspire national spirit, and the way to start is literacy education. 100% of the people in Germany are literate, so their national power can gradually become stronger. If more than 80% of the people in our country are still illiterate in the future, it will be difficult to resolve the national crisis and it will be difficult to revive the nation.</p>
<p>(4) Regarding civil rights: People today like to talk about democratic politics, thinking that Chinese politics should be managed by the people themselves. This theory is very attractive, and the current government does not oppose it. However, most people today are illiterate, and cannot even write their own names. How can the government hand over political power to the people? Therefore, if the people want to expand their own civil rights, they must work hard to promote literacy education. In the past, autocratic governments, in order to deceive the people, implemented policies of ignorance and did not allow the people to be educated. Now, the municipal government, for the purpose of benefiting the people, is promoting literacy education on a large scale, and the people must not miss this great opportunity.</p>
<p>(5) Regarding people's livelihood: Our people's livelihood is declining due to backward production, and the reason for backward production is the lack of development of science. If we want to solve the people's livelihood problem in the future, then all industries, agriculture, commerce, transportation, etc. must use scientific methods to actively improve. The principle of "saving the country through science" has been recognized by everyone, but if people are not literate, how can scientific knowledge be instilled? Therefore, if you want to solve the people's livelihood problem (the problem of food, clothing, housing, and transportation), you must first promote literacy education.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, literacy education is the foundation of all education, and it is necessary to actively promote it for the country and the people. Moreover, the literacy education that this city intends to promote is not just simple literacy education. In addition to literacy education, there is also common sense guidance and civic training, so its significance is even more important.</p>
<p>(3) Public Enrollment and Remedial Education Methods</p>
<p>Illiterate people enroll in school for remedial education. This is one of the literacy education methods in this city. The main points are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>(1) This city will implement compulsory literacy education starting from July 1, 1935. All illiterate people in this city should receive literacy education.</p>
<p>(2) This city will implement compulsory literacy education for a period of one year, from July 1, 1935 to June 30, 1936.</p>
<p>(3) The class time of literacy schools should be selected by each out-of-school person at the time of the survey within the specified time (approximately children and women during the day, and adult men in the evening) from three to six types, and the literacy schools will coordinate and designate them. Household workers and shop employees should be given convenience by their employers to attend classes, and should not be arbitrarily made difficult.</p>
<p>(4) People who should receive literacy education, if they delay enrollment without reason after receiving the admission notice from the literacy school, in addition to being forced to enroll, will also be fined between two dimes and five yuan, or be ordered to perform labor service for more than two hours and less than five days. The same applies to those who are absent from class without reason. Those who have a reason to ask for leave in the middle and are approved by the literacy school must make up the lesson within the specified time. For the penalties in the preceding paragraph, adult men and women will be fined themselves, and minors will be fined their parents.</p>
<p>(5) The penalties in Article 4 will be decided by the district office after being reported by each literacy school, and the Public Security Bureau will be notified to carry out the penalties, and will be reported to the City Literacy Education Committee for the record on a monthly basis.</p>
<p>(6) Literacy schools do not charge any fees to their students, and textbooks are also provided by the school. However, other school supplies, such as pencils and paper, should be prepared by the students themselves.</p>
<p>(7) Students of literacy schools who pass the examination after the teaching period expires will be issued an initial general education certificate by the Shanghai Literacy Education Committee.</p>
<p>(8) People who should receive literacy education, if they cannot attend classes due to an accident, should explain the reason to the district office or to the nearby literacy school and report it to the district office. After the district office verifies the facts, they may be allowed to study on their own outside the school. Separate measures will be formulated for the aforementioned out-of-school remedial education.</p>
<p>(4) Public Off-Campus Tutoring Measures</p>
<p>Illiterate people can have off-campus tutoring. This is the second method of literacy education in this city. The main points are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Illiterate people, if they have real difficulties and cannot study at a literacy school, should follow these measures and the articles of association of the Literacy Education Service Corps for off-campus tutoring.</p>
<p>(2) Illiterate people who have off-campus tutoring should report to the district office of the Shanghai Literacy Education Committee or the nearby literacy school before tutoring, and report to the district office. Only after the district office verifies that there are indeed difficulties and approves it can they start.</p>
<p>(3) People who have off-campus tutoring must follow the articles of association of the Literacy Education Service Corps and designate a teacher. Before starting tutoring, they must fill out two copies of the volunteer form.</p>
<p>(4) The time for off-campus tutoring is determined by the person and their teacher, but after the time is determined, teaching must be carried out on time.</p>
<p>(5) People who have off-campus tutoring must collect literacy textbooks from the district office. No fees will be charged.</p>
<p>(6) In addition to literacy education, people who have off-campus tutoring may be given civic training and common sense guidance by the district office or the service corps branch, and must not evade it.</p>
<p>(7) People who have off-campus tutoring must be tested once or twice a month and must not evade it.</p>
<p>(8) People who have off-campus tutoring should be examined by the service corps branch or the district office after a considerable period of time (approximately two or three months) and after reading all the literacy textbooks. Those who pass the examination will be given an initial general education certificate.</p>
<p>(9) People who have off-campus tutoring and whose performance is too poor may be ordered by the district office to restudy at a nearby literacy school.</p>
<p>(5) Charter of the Literacy Education Service Corps</p>
<p>The Literacy Education Service Corps mentioned above is a supplement to literacy schools. Its charter has been formulated. The main points are recorded below:</p>
<p>(1) The Shanghai Literacy Education Service Corps (hereinafter referred to as the Corps) aims to contribute its abilities, serve the people, and assist the government in promoting literacy education.</p>
<p>(2) Teachers and students of all levels of schools and private schools in this city who agree with the purpose of this Corps and are willing to accept the supervision and guidance of the Corps may register with the branch of this Corps and become members after being approved by the head of the branch.</p>
<p>(3) This Corps has a general Corps in the Shanghai Literacy Education Committee and branches in schools and private schools at all levels. The branches are named Shanghai Literacy Education Service Corps ×× School (Private School) Branch.</p>
<p>(4) This Corps has one Corps leader and one Corps deputy leader, who are filled by the chairman and vice chairman of the Shanghai Literacy Education Committee. There is also one general secretary and two deputy general secretaries, who are appointed by the Qihai Literacy Education Committee.</p>
<p>(5) Each branch has one head, who is filled by the school principal or private school teacher where the branch is located, and may have several deputy heads, who are filled by teachers at all levels. The above-mentioned head is appointed by the head of this Corps, and the deputy heads are appointed by the head of this Corps upon the recommendation of the head of each branch.</p>
<p>(6) All members of this Corps have the responsibility to teach people to read. Each member must find at least two illiterate people (including children) in each period (two months) to teach them to read. The teaching time is determined by the teacher and the students, but teaching must be carried out on time after the time is determined.</p>
<p>(7) When teaching begins, members should, together with the people they are teaching, fill out two copies of the volunteer form in accordance with the format set by the Shanghai Literacy Education Committee. One copy is kept by the branch, and one copy is sent by the branch to the district office of the Shanghai Literacy Education Committee for the record.</p>
<p>(8) Members should fill out two copies of the teaching status each month according to the forms made by this Corps, one kept by the branch and one submitted to this Corps for evaluation.</p>
<p>(9) When a member has finished teaching, they should immediately report to the head of the branch and notify the students to go to the head of the branch for testing on a regular basis. If the test passes, the head of the branch will notify the district office of the Shanghai Literacy Education Committee to issue an initial general education certificate, but the district office may re-examine. If it is deemed unqualified, the original member should teach again. Those whose performance is too poor may be directly sent by the district office to a literacy school for compulsory education.</p>
<p>(10) During the teaching process of members, the head or deputy head of the branch should test the students at least once a month. This Corps and the district office of the Shanghai Literacy Education Committee may also send people to conduct spot checks at any time.</p>
<p>(11) The head of the branch should gather all the people taught by the members of the branch at least every two weeks or in batches to conduct civic training and common sense guidance. The method will be formulated separately.</p>
<p>(12) If the branch is a middle or higher school, and its members find it inconvenient to leave the school to individually teach illiterate people, they may set up a people's school or literacy school to replace it. The examination of the grades of the aforementioned schools is subject to the provisions of the above articles.</p>
<p>(13) If the number of members of the branch exceeds one-quarter of the number of students in the school, and more than three-quarters of the members have taught people in each of the three periods, this Corps will give a certificate of merit at the end of the third period. If the number exceeds one-half, and all the members have taught people in the three periods, this Corps will award a banner in addition to asking the Shanghai Education Bureau to issue an order to commend the principal.</p>
<p>(14) If the number of members of the branch cannot exceed one-fifth of the number of students in the school, or the number of people taught by the members is less than one-half on average in each of the three periods, this Corps will ask the Shanghai Education Bureau to reprimand the principal according to the circumstances.</p>
<p>(15) If a member teaches literacy to more than three people in one period and all have passed the test and obtained certificates, the head of the branch will give a certificate of merit. Those who exceed ten people will also be awarded a banner by this Corps to encourage them. Those who do not work hard will be warned by the head of the branch, or have their membership revoked, or have their civil score deducted.</p>
<p>(16) For branches that set up schools in accordance with Article 14 (i.e., Article 12 above), the number of people taught by their members is offset by the number of people taught.</p>
<p>(6) Propaganda Slogans</p>
<p>(1) Having eyes but not knowing characters is like being half-blind.</p>
<p>(2) Just because you don't know characters, you have suffered all the hardships.</p>
<p>(3) Using both hands and brains is a great thing for old people.</p>
<p>(4) The content of literacy education: (1) Literacy education, (2) Common sense guidance, (3) Civic training.</p>
<p>(5) Literacy education is a patriotic movement with unexpected effects.</p>
<p>(6) Literate people have the responsibility to teach illiterate people.</p>
<p>(7) Employers should give their workers the opportunity to become literate.</p>
<p>(8) Teaching people to read is better than building a seven-story pagoda.</p>
<p>(9) Literacy schools will be set up nearby, with no tuition fees and free books. Illiterate people should spend an hour each day to study and can graduate in two months.</p>
<p>(10) If illiterate people refuse to learn to read, the municipal government will impose a fine or labor service, and may even deport them in the future.</p>

<p>A. Differences in the International Economy</p>
<p>Since the abandonment of the gold standard by the United Kingdom, Japan, and the United States, most countries have adopted methods such as reducing currency value and exchange rates, and industrial control and tariff barriers, as prerequisites for restoring their national economies. This year's economic policies continue to be implemented and are becoming more stringent. For countries that have abandoned the gold standard, the production prices and export trade of the United Kingdom and the United States have generally increased, the number of unemployed people has decreased, the cost of living index for the people has not changed dramatically, and the purchasing power is better than before. Japan's progress is particularly significant. As for countries that maintain the gold standard, with the exception of Germany's new economic policy, which is different, countries such as France have not failed to use control methods to seek self-defense, but the domestic currency value has not fallen sharply, and the external exchange rate has risen, so production has decreased, prices have fallen, unemployment has increased, and exports have declined, which is the opposite of countries that have abandoned the gold standard. Although the international situation is not entirely the same, it is in the same position for our country's front. All trade markets regard our country as the tail end. This can be asserted. As for the silver issue, it is even more serious. The United States implemented the Silver Act in June, purchasing 1.3 billion ounces of silver, and announced the nationalization of silver in August. Silver from all over the world rushed to the United States like a torrent. According to a survey by Handy &amp; Harman, an American company, the world's silver production this year totaled 181.2 million ounces. The supply from all parties totaled 255 million ounces, of which China sold as much as 200 million ounces, exceeding the world's output and accounting for approximately four-fifths of the world's supply. Silver is the lifeblood of the financial system of silver standard countries. The amount of outflow is so large that the impact of international economic policies on our country's economic undertakings directly affects financial undertakings. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Hua Hua Silk and Satin Company, located on Third Ma Road (三馬路) and Shi Road (石路), has been in business for many years and rents the building of the Silk Industry Building. Now, because the landlord, the Silk Industry Bank, wants to expand its business and add a trust department, it wants to take back the property for its own use. The company has begun to sort out all the silk and satin in stock, and after the sorting is completed, all the stock will be sold off at extremely low prices starting from May 1st, regardless of cost, with the aim of clearing everything out. According to employees of the company, this sale includes all kinds of fashionable goods that are priced below cost, unlike other stores that only use one or two cheap items as bait to attract customers. Therefore, the prices are so low that no competitor can match them. It is expected that customers will be extremely crowded. It can be seen that the company's sale is a great sacrifice.</p>

The Ministry of Education has repeatedly sent personnel to various provinces and cities in recent years to inspect and supervise higher education in the sparrow cities. The dispatch of personnel to inspect Sichuan Province is also in the planning. The province's telegram requesting the reorganization of education in Sichuan Province coincided with the Ministry's plans.

<p>After the China Cultural Construction Association independently organized the National Reading Competition, registration offices were set up at the association's branches in various provinces and cities. Since the start of registration, participation has been enthusiastic, with dozens or hundreds of people registering every day, reflecting the large number of eager learners in our country who wish to pursue in-depth academic research. Because China is vast and the remote areas have inconvenient transportation, the association has extended the original registration deadline of April 30th by half a month to May 15th to avoid disappointing eager learners. This has been notified to the registration offices of each branch for compliance.</p>
<p>In addition, the association's list of required and reference books for the university and middle school groups can be purchased at a special discount from various bookstores. However, according to letters from participating members, the prices of the various books required for the university group are still considered slightly high, and it is suggested that reference books can be purchased as needed, or that three to five members can form a reading group and read in turn. This method can also be considered for adoption and is provided for reference by the members.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Transportation, Songhu Merchant Marine College is the only existing maritime school in the country. Today's maritime leaders mostly come from the two classes of graduates of the school. Because generally untrained sailors are still increasing, and the sailor examination has not been concluded as scheduled, the employment prospects of the school's students are becoming increasingly difficult. Therefore, they gathered in panic a few days ago and made three requests to the school and the Ministry of Communications: (1) Please ensure that the Ministry of Communications concludes the sailor examination as scheduled in June this year, and strictly ban current sailors who have not passed the examination, so as to ensure safety and expand employment opportunities. (2) The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company is the only state-run shipping agency, and the school is the only national maritime school. Therefore, graduates of the school should have priority in being hired by the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. (3) Before having formal employment after graduation, there should be a corresponding living allowance to ensure that they can concentrate on seeking employment and not be forced to seek other solutions due to livelihood pressures midway, and live up to the government's intention of cultivating maritime commerce. It is reported that the school principal, Wu Daming, believes that the students' request is appropriate and has submitted it to the Ministry of Communications for review and approval.</p>

<h3 id="e184">Referees' Football Match Ends in a Draw: Westerners Score Two Goals in the First Half, Chinese Team Equalizes in the Second Half <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>The football season is nearing its end. Members of the Chinese and Western referees' associations, hearing of a lack of activity, organized a friendly match yesterday at the Shen Garden. Although the teams featured many veterans, some were either too old or had been out of practice for too long to be considered formidable. On the Western side, only seven players arrived, preventing them from forming a full team. Therefore, Yue Xiurong and Chen Shao of the Chinese association temporarily joined as guest players, making the teams relatively equal in strength. The match was divided into two halves, each lasting thirty minutes. Due to the players' waning stamina, everyone played with flushed faces and a mix of serious effort and comical blunders. The Chinese team narrowly escaped defeat, resulting in a 2-2 draw. Referee Zhong Yongsen officiated before an audience of five to six hundred people, making for a lively event.</p>
<p>Under the call to action, the Western team launched a fierce attack. "Chaplin" Yue Xiurong showed no mercy, aggressively attacking the Chinese territory, repeatedly. Haddon, a renowned Western substitute player, seized the opportunity and played with great bravery. Fortunately, Zhou Jia, despite his age, remained alert and managed to deflect several attacks. After a period of chaos, Zhu [unclear] led the charge forward, while Qu Hongren, with a serious demeanor, dribbled deep into the field. However, his feet failed him, and Chen Shao easily intercepted the ball. As the back-and-forth continued, time flew by, and the first half was nearly over.</p>
<p>Afterward, Helly, the mainstay of the Western team, repeatedly attempted to break through and capture the stronghold, but to no avail. In the midst of this stalemate, Helly seized another opportunity, and Zhou Jia, in a panic, not only failed to make a save but also stumbled backward. Helly then gently tapped the ball in, scoring the first goal for the Western team with a score of 1-0. Five minutes later, Helly launched another attack, Zhang Le's attempt to block him failed, and Zhou Jia, resembling a startled bird, watched as Keith Lay slightly moved his foot, resulting in the Chinese team falling behind by two goals.</p>
<p>After the first half, the Chinese team, recognizing their weak forward line, saw Zhu Qiu volunteer his old prowess and rally the team, taking over as the lead striker. Dong Xiaopei then reported for active duty, forming a partnership that proved quite effective. In the Western team's territory, danger loomed. Before long, Ni Xiaoben passed the ball from the right corner, and Qu Hongren touched it with his heel right in front of the goal, resulting in immediate success. From then on, the Chinese team's morale soared.</p>
<p>Qu Hongren, Zhu Qiu, and Shao Yueping launched three fierce attacks in succession, creating immense pressure. Although Chen Shao managed to save each shot, the Western team was significantly shaken. Shortly after, Dong Xiaopei persevered, advancing alone, step by step, along the right flank of the defense. Unexpectedly, he launched a diagonal kick, and Chen Shao was unable to save it, resulting in a 2-2 draw. With their spirits high, the Chinese team continued their relentless attacks, but Qu Hongren's weak footing led to several missed opportunities. As time ran out, each team had scored two goals, ending in a harmonious tie, and everyone dispersed with cheers.</p>

<p>The White Rainbow Team, which won the overall championship with a total score of 68 points at yesterday's International Seven-Group Sports Meet, has been recognized by Chinese and foreign individuals as the only strong track and field team in Shanghai. The team members were originally scattered in various locations. This time, due to participating in yesterday's international sports meet, they gathered in large numbers. Therefore, it has been decided to hold a sports meet for all team members at 2 PM today at Hongkou Park, as a comprehensive review of the performance of all team members. Except for the javelin and discus events, which the Public Works Department advised against due to public safety concerns, all other events are fully prepared. However, the star athlete Liu Changchun cannot participate due to a recurrence of a leg injury. Li Shiming is also unable to participate as he has not fully recovered from a previous javelin injury. All other team members will participate. The Suzhou branch team members are also all in Shanghai. It is expected to be a grand occasion. Admission is free; anyone with a park pass can attend. The purpose of this sports meet is that previous competitions have always been dominated by the team's top athletes. Taking advantage of this rare opportunity, the team's unsung heroes can also show their talent.</p>

<p>The Chinese-Western Seven-Group Spring Track and Field Meet, with participants including White Rainbow, Sakur, Macklin, Western Youth, Hai Qing, English Inn, and American Public, was held yesterday afternoon at the American Public Sports Field on Beidang Road. The event attracted a large crowd of several hundred spectators. The White Rainbow team, with its gathering of talented athletes and strong overall strength, ultimately won the championship with a significant score of 73 points. Sakur came in second, Western Youth third, Macklins fourth, English Inn fifth, American Public sixth, and Hai Qing last. Yesterday, a total of nine Shanghai records were broken. The scores and results of each team are listed below:</p>
<p>Team Scores</p>
<p>White Rainbow 73 points Sakur 35 points</p>
<p>Western Youth 18 points Macklins 17 points</p>
<p>English Inn 12 points American Public School 6 points</p>
<p>Hai Qing 2 points</p>
<p>Special Achievements</p>
<p>A total of nine Shanghai records were broken. The best of these was Jia Lianren's 2 minutes and 4 seconds for the 880 yards. Li Shiming competed while injured, almost breaking the record. Fu Baolu's 12 feet and 2.5 inches in the pole vault was unmatched. Unfortunately, the height of the wooden frame had reached its limit, leaving the hero with no ground to display his skills. In the medley relay, Liu Changchun ran the fourth leg for 200 yards, gaining a lead of 200 yards over second place. Russian Tom Shevsky's 10 seconds flat in the 100 yards had great stamina, causing Cheng Jinguang to be overtaken. Zeng Rongzhong's performance in the 440 yards, where he surged to the championship in the final 110 yards, was a masterpiece. Yesterday, the White Rainbow team was full of talent and can be considered a great success.</p>
<p>International Hopes</p>
<p>Yesterday's sports meet served as a prediction for the upcoming international track and field meet. Although the achievements of the Chinese athletes were not yet fully satisfying, they were more than enough to overwhelm other countries. Except for Russian Prokofyev, who won three gold medals, the other countries had mediocre and unremarkable talent, demonstrating the decline of international talent in Shanghai. It is a pity that our country's shot putters, Chen Baoqiu and Leng Peigen, have not shown any progress.</p>

<p>Since its establishment, the Shanghai Postal Savings Bureau's football and ping pong teams have achieved remarkable results. Recently, in response to the Ministry's order to promote sports, their efforts have been even more enthusiastic. Taking advantage of the pleasant spring weather and the weekly holidays, the team is scheduled to travel to Suzhou tonight and has arranged to hold group matches with well-known teams in Suzhou.</p>
<h3 id="e197">My Philosophy as a Basketball Referee (4) <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>— By Mr. Dahl of the United States, Translated by Qian Yiqin</p>
<p>Mechanical Procedures. A few more points regarding mechanical procedures and physical condition remain. When a single referee is officiating, it is best to be constantly in front of the offense, in this position, all of the play can be clearly observed. This means that the referee must quickly move his position to the other end of the court whenever the offensive team changes. This is not impossible, because the referee will soon be able to move in time to the main part of the court, and from that position, any direction can be reached. Sometimes it is difficult to quickly follow the offense and move to one end of the court, or stay behind the ball and the offense, but one should not stay behind the ball and the offense, but immediately move to the front of the offense. This requires a strong physique, which goes without saying.</p>
<p>Physical Condition. The physical health of a successful referee is as important as that of a player in an actual game. Therefore, one must always train. Regarding the physical condition of a referee, it is often mentioned in terms of one's "breath," but in the author's opinion, the condition of one's "legs" is more important than "breath." Therefore, a referee is only as strong as his weakest leg. If his legs cannot quickly bring him to the front of the offense, his efficiency as a referee will be reduced. Although his eyes are as sharp as when he was young, he cannot stand far across the court and call a foul as well as when he is in front of the ball. His legs must lead his eyes to the most easily seen position. Therefore, when his legs are no longer capable, it is better for the referee to decide to put his old whistle on the shelf and retire permanently.</p>
<p>If a referee takes his work seriously, he should train his body to a strong condition before the start of the basketball season. One should never officiate the first game of the season without any preparation. It is best to consult with the coach and practice playing ball before the start of the season. This will not only train the body but also train the eyes. It is not a good practice to start officiating official games and receive school compensation from the beginning. It is better to use it as practice refereeing. Such practice and preparation should be done before the start of the season.</p>
<p>Two-Referee System. This article cannot be considered complete if it does not mention the two-referee system. The two-referee system can be divided into two types, which I think are known to most readers. In one system, both referees proceed along the sidelines of the court, each calling fouls according to what they see, regardless of where they are. In another system, one referee controls one side of the court, and when the offense moves to the right side of the court, he moves to the basket and watches the offense coming towards him. The other referee moves down along his side, following behind the offense. If the direction of the offense changes, the latter gradually moves to the opponent's basket, and the former follows behind the offense. Thus, there is always one person in front of the offense and one person behind. The author believes that this system is better than the other system, where one person only controls one side of the court and there is no designated person responsible for the play under the basket.</p>
<p>If two people only move back and forth along one side of the court, it is easy for both people to focus on the actions near the ball, and there is no designated person responsible for the fixed parts of the court. It is common to encounter the problem of simultaneously whistling to announce the same action, and each person cannot decide who should call the foul, or wait for the other person to call the foul, resulting in both people abandoning this duty and responsibility.</p>
<p>The secret to the success of the two-referee system lies in two principles: first, one person must always be in front of the offense and迎之; second, the other person must always be behind the offense and追之. Regarding the relationship between the two referees, the most important thing is that the referee behind the offense must know and feel when he should not blow his whistle.</p>
<p>The person on the court and under the basket should be fully responsible for the actions in that area, because he is in the best position to observe all the actions. With this responsibility clearly defined, the person behind the offense will not be forced to call everything in front of the court, because he cannot call them because his position is not suitable for observing the game. The most difficult situation to discern is when a player is closely guarding someone who is about to make a basket. The referee in front of the offense only sees a legitimate defense, while the referee behind the offense calls a holding foul, which is actually not a foul. The person behind the ball sees it as if it were a foul, so he calls it, but he should not do this and should let the referee in front take the initiative and call everything. This is a difficult situation and will only be successful when both referees are used to working together. However, the referee behind the ball should of course also call fouls in front of the court, but this must be a very obvious foul or violation, especially when the companion in front is far away from the game and in a difficult position to see. The referee behind the ball should call it only if they practice cooperation and the one behind is always careful to blow the whistle, and the above difficulties can be resolved.</p>
<p>In all respects, this system has many advantages over the system where two people only officiate along the sidelines of the court. Because each person's area is defined and they feel responsible within their area, they do not need to worry about whether the other referee will call a foul, nor do they need to worry about their own whistle blowing, thus avoiding the problem of omissions. This system also eliminates the problem of one person working while the other watches, or one referee calling before the other. Because the responsibilities are divided, many whistles can be avoided, resulting in excellent refereeing.</p>
<p>Conclusion. In conclusion, it should be clear that the referee is responsible for the game regardless of whether the outcome of the game is satisfactory or not. He is temporarily a representative of the rules committee, which is of great significance to the committee, because today there are often people who want to criticize the committee's decisions.</p>
<p>This responsibility is always present, and from the perspective of the game of basketball, it is better to have a satisfactory outcome than an unsatisfactory one. The referee cannot avoid being criticized or praised. The referee is best to find inner satisfaction in his good refereeing. To seek satisfaction, one must follow the rules outlined above.</p>
<p>The public's criticism is as changeable as the weather. The author recalls a time when the two sides were enemies, because the key to winning the championship was that if one team won, the championship would be taken away, and if the other team won, the scores would be equal, and they would have to play again. Therefore, the competition was extremely fierce. As a result, the team that could immediately win the championship lost by two points, causing the two referees who officiated the game to be slightly criticized. A commentator for a certain newspaper believed that the two people failed to handle the game well and caused too many fouls, so harsh comments were added to them. A week later, the two teams fought for the final championship. Because of the suppression of the referees (the two people were hired from another city), the game was very clean. After this excellent game, the newspaper commentator from last week, who had severely criticized the referees for being too strict, now accused the two referees of being too focused on fighting. One should know that dissatisfied people often like to criticize in order to achieve their private desires, and the spread of criticism is extraordinarily rapid. As for conscientious referees and well-officiated games, they never brag. Although, unfair criticism will eventually be like the flowing water of the east, gone forever. (End)</p>

<h3 id="e198">How to Be a "Scientific Child" <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>— Jun Peng</p>
<p>Weapon Materials There are no waste products in the world, only wasteful people. Those who don't know how to use waste products are wasteful people. When we poor children play scientific tricks, how can we afford any scientific instruments? Bamboo heads, wood scraps, cotton, rags are all raw materials for making guns and bullets. If you come across cake boxes, glass bottles, tin cans, needles, rope, ink bottles, iron wire, etc., you must save them to prepare for future weapons.</p>
<p>Self-Made Guns We need to build guns for combat, but foreign instruments are very expensive. Then, we have to make our own instruments, that is, use those many wastes mentioned earlier. Don't have an alcohol lamp? Use an ink bottle to imitate a small alcohol lamp. Don't have a soft cork? Wrap it with cotton and cloth. Don't have methylated spirits? Just distill the liquor. Don't have glass? Find a few thin bamboo tubes or wax paper tubes to replace them. Children! I just give a few examples, but it's up to your smart brains to use them. If you really can't do it yourself, then go out and buy them.</p>
<p>Losing Battles A scientific child is not afraid of failure. If the trick is not successful, don't be discouraged, don't be tired. If you fall, get up and try again. You must achieve the goal. Failure is our greatest teacher. We must have an indomitable spirit to create a "scientific child." If you have little contact, you will run away, this is definitely not a scientific child, and you will never be able to take on the mission of creating a "scientific China"!</p>

<p>— Tu Hongxia</p>
<p>During the Warring States period, there was a man named Su Qin from Luoyang. He was a strategist. Initially, he went to persuade King Hui of Qin, but King Hui did not believe him. As a result, he was unsuccessful and returned home. All the clothes and travel expenses he had taken with him were used up, and he was in a sorry state. When he returned home, his wife, sister-in-law, father, and mother all ignored him. When his clothes were torn, his wife refused to mend them. When he was hungry, his sister-in-law refused to give him food.</p>
<p>He felt extremely unhappy, so he resolved to study hard. Late at night, when he was tired and wanted to sleep, he would prick his thigh with an awl, and the blood would flow to his feet. Startled awake, he would continue reading. After studying for three years, he went to the State of Zhao. The King of Zhao trusted him greatly and appointed him as Prime Minister. After becoming an official and returning home, his wife, sister-in-law, father, and mother all rushed to greet him from afar.</p>
<p>Children, you must know that the result of suffering is happiness!</p>
<h3 id="e200">Diamond <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>— Zhen</p>
<p>One Sunday, Le'er and Hua'er went to the bustling market to buy some things. They passed by a hardware store and saw a person using something like a pencil to score glass. In a short while, the glass was neatly cut.</p>
<p>"Brother, look, how can that pencil-like thing cut glass?" Hua'er asked his brother in surprise.</p>
<p>"That thing is made of wood, and at the end, there is a very small diamond. It's just like the diamond ring we see Mom wearing on her finger, only bigger. Because diamond is a very hard crystal, it can cut glass." Le'er replied.</p>
<p>"Aren't diamonds very expensive? I heard that Mom's ring cost several thousand dollars. Then that wooden stick for cutting glass must cost dozens of dollars, right? Is that so?"</p>
<p>"That's not necessary, it only costs a few dollars because it's man-made."</p>
<p>"Huh! That's strange! Can diamonds be man-made? Then how are they made?"</p>
<p>"Man-made diamonds are not much different from natural ones. Man-made diamonds are just smaller crystals. Natural ones are not very beautiful in shape and must be polished to have a beautiful luster. The method of making man-made diamonds is to dissolve pure carbon (by charring white sugar) in molten iron, then throw it into cold water. The iron will suddenly solidify, and then a chemical is added to dissolve the iron, and a man-made diamond can be obtained."</p>
<p>So Hua'er bought his things and quickly went home to try it out.</p>

<p>Sister said to her younger brother, "We have nothing to do right now. Let's play a math game, okay?"</p>
<p>The younger brother said, "Great! I like all games! Please tell me the rules of the game."</p>
<p>The sister said, "You prepare a piece of paper and a pencil. Without me seeing, you write down a two-digit number at random."</p>
<p>The younger brother hurriedly wrote the numbers "32," and said, "I've already written them down. What do I do next?"</p>
<p>The sister said, "You multiply the first digit by two, then add one; after adding, multiply by five; after multiplying, add the second digit. After you calculate this, tell me the answer, and I will know the two-digit number you originally wrote."</p>
<p>"Wow! That's amazing!" Saying that, he started calculating:</p>
<p>The younger brother said, "I've calculated it. The answer is thirty-six. Please guess!"</p>
<p>The sister, without thinking, smiled and replied, "The two-digit number you wrote down at the beginning wasn't '31', was it?"</p>
<p>"Haha! That's exactly right! What method did you use to guess it?"</p>
<p>The sister said, "The method is simple and unremarkable. I just need to subtract five from your answer in my head, and I'll get it. Think about it, thirty-six minus five is thirty-one, right?"</p>
<p>The younger brother let his sister guess several more times, and she guessed correctly every time. The younger brother was extremely happy. The younger brother said, "Tomorrow I'll go to school and let my classmates guess!"</p>

<h3 id="e204">Kite <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>— Ding He</p>
<p>The spring weather is exceptionally pleasant. The spring breeze is blowing gently, making it perfect for flying kites on the grass. Today, let's study kites together:</p>
<p>(1) Why do kites rise? The rising of a kite relies on the resistance of the air, which generates a lift force to push the kite into the sky (as shown in Figure A). The stronger the wind, the greater the lift force, and the higher the kite rises. If the wind is small, the lift force generated is small, and the kite cannot be flown. However, whether the string (belly string) on the kite is tied properly or not can also affect the magnitude of the lift force. If the string is tied too straight, with a large angle, the lift force generated is too small (as shown in Figure B). The wind creates a vortex on the back of the kite, increasing the pressure on the kite and adding to its weight, making it impossible to fly. However, if the string is tied too slanted, with a small angle, the kite also cannot be flown. We know that if the weight of the kite is greater than the lift force, it will definitely not be able to fly.</p>
<p>(2) How to Make a Kite: Now that we understand the principle of kite flying, making a kite is relatively easy. Materials for making a kite: bamboo, mulberry paper. Tools: knife, scissors, glue. Split the bamboo into thin strips with a knife, making sure they are evenly thick. Then (in Figure 2), choose the shape you like and tie them together. After tying them together (as shown in Figure 3), dab on some red ink or black ink to enhance the kite's appearance.</p>
<p>If the kite we tied leans to one side after being flown (as shown in Figure 4), it means that the leaning side is heavier. We should try to lighten the leaning side or add an equal amount of weight to the other side (the lighter side).</p>
<p>Children, look at how much fun they are having flying kites in Figure 5. Let's also make a kite and try it out!</p>

<p>(1) The little frog went out to play and saw a cow drinking water, drinking a lot, which he found very strange.</p>
<p>(2) When the little frog went back, he imitated the cow, making his belly very big, and showed it to his companions.</p>
<p>(3) Unexpectedly, his belly burst!</p>
<p>(4) The companions carried the little frog to the doctor to be treated.</p>
<h3 id="e206">Children's Bank <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>— Chonglou</p>
<p>There are various banks in society, and now I want to advocate for a "Children's Bank"; but this "Children's Bank" that I advocate is not for saving money, but for saving wisdom.</p>
<p>Because when people are young, their food and clothing can be provided by their parents, and they don't have to bear the responsibility of economics themselves. They can devote their energy to their studies; so the "Children's Bank" that I am now advocating is to increase the strength of children's learning.</p>
<p>Here, let me list two articles of the "Children's Bank" charter below—</p>
<p>"Lump-sum withdrawal of regular savings"; This method requires children to accumulate their knowledge slowly, and then take it out for application when they have accumulated a whole. For example, if you want to be a scientist, then you should deposit the scientific knowledge you have learned in the bank uninterruptedly. After ten years, you will definitely be able to become a great scientist who can invent things.</p>
<p>"Withdrawal of regular savings at any time", This article requires children to store what they have learned at ordinary times and then take it out for application at any time. For example, today you learned arithmetic from the teacher, you store it in the bank, and when you have to calculate accounts for buying things at home tomorrow, you take this arithmetic out for application...</p>
<p>Children! Are you willing to enthusiastically participate in this convenient and stable "Children's Bank" as its depositor?</p>
<h3 id="e207">Children's New Life <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>— Ba Ling</p>
<p>Now is the time when the New Life Movement is being vigorously promoted. Adults must, of course, follow the items of the New Life and do them earnestly. However, children are the future masters of the country and the reformers of society, and they must especially work hard to implement the New Life. In my opinion, children's new life must at least achieve the following things to be called a new child:</p>
<p>(1) Get up early every day, brush your teeth, take deep breaths, and do calisthenics.</p>
<p>(2) Arrive at school on time to study, and show appropriate politeness to teachers and classmates.</p>
<p>(3) Concentrate on listening in class; do not cheat during exams.</p>
<p>(4) Chew food carefully, and take a walk for half an hour after drinking, avoiding strenuous exercise.</p>
<p>(5) Books and objects must be organized clearly, and not be messy or damaged.</p>
<p>(6) Be able to help parents at home and do what you can.</p>
<p>(7) Do not quarrel with siblings, and always show courtesy and respect in your behavior.</p>
<p>(8) Do not develop bad habits, and regard smoking and gambling as harmful demons, and resolve not to approach them.</p>
<p>(9) Always find ways to help others anytime, anywhere.</p>
<p>(10) Clothes should be changed often, and the body should be bathed regularly.</p>
<h3 id="e208">Eradication of Microbes <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>— Ren Chaojun</p>
<p>Microbes are terrible microorganisms. If they enter the lungs, they can cause various diseases. Their traces are everywhere—whether in the air, on utensils, or on clothes.</p>
<p>Indeed, it is not easy for microbes to reach the inside of our bodies. If they enter through the nasal cavity, nasal hairs will block them. If they get past the nasal hairs, then the felt hairs on the inner wall of the trachea will catch them. If they enter through the oral cavity, the saliva in the oral cavity can prevent their reproduction. If they remain in the nostrils, oral cavity, and trachea, the mucous membrane there is not very suitable for their reproduction. As for them entering through broken skin, white blood cells inside will kill them, but this is only for healthy people. They can still reach the inside of weakened bodies, so we should strengthen our bodies and eradicate the bacteria nearby.</p>
<p>Regarding methods of eradication: 1. Mix hot lime and water and use it to brush walls and pour it into drains and toilets. 2. Use formaldehyde gas to kill microbes in rooms. 3. Eliminate their vectors—flies and mosquitoes. 4. Boil clothes in boiling water to kill microbes. Other methods include drinking boiled water, ensuring that rooms have plenty of sunlight, and breathing fresh air.</p>
<p>Children, now is spring, the season when they multiply. We should quickly eradicate them to avoid the occurrence of various infectious diseases in the summer.</p>

<p>— Xin Qing</p>
<p>I thought that dying slowly in that dark tomb seemed worse than any other fate. I thought that even giving those savages a meal was not half as unfortunate as this.</p>
<p>The day came when I was to be lowered into the tomb on the mountaintop. As usual, I was wearing my best clothes and precious stones. Because I was such a big figure locally, the king and queen, along with a large crowd, came to the tomb entrance to see our end.</p>
<p>My wife's body was lowered first, followed by me in an uncovered box with a pot of water and a few small loaves of bread. Then I was lowered down, and the tomb entrance was sealed.</p>
<p>When I looked around, I saw that I was in a kind of large cave, a hundred yards deep. All the precious gems and beautiful clothes of the dead were everywhere on the ground, and there were white bones of the dead all around.</p>
<p>I sat on the ground crying, thinking that my life would end in this way. I thought that even if I had lost my life in the wind and waves at sea, it would be the same as this strange death.</p>
<p>However, spending time on such thoughts was useless to me, so I ate a piece of bread and drank water from the pot. Thus, I stayed well in the tomb for several days. As you listen on, you will know that trying to save myself was a good thing.</p>
<p>One day I heard a sound, as if some creature was moving. I walked towards the source of the sound, but the thing ran away as I approached. I continued on, and soon I saw a glimmer of light shining like a star.</p>
<p>I kept moving forward, and finally, imagine how happy I was—I found that the light was coming through a large hole in the rock. When I walked out of this hole, I saw that it led to the seashore. The sound I had heard turned out to be an animal that came out of the sea every day, passed through the hole in the rock, and came to the cave to eat the dead.</p>
<p>Once I determined that I was safe in this place, I knelt on the beach to thank God for protecting me. After I rested for a while, I returned to the cave to retrieve the food that was left behind. There, I took the best gems and the food I could find, and then returned to the seashore.</p>

<p>Spring sun! You are like an alarm clock, awakening many sleeping little animals. Look, the bee brother is out working; look, the butterfly sister is out dancing; and there are countless small companions singing and jumping. Even our children take off their light clothes, perk up their spirits, and play on the grass. Looking at this crowd of children, you are probably smiling so much that you can't close your mouth.</p>
<p>Spring sun! You are truly our loving mother, may you always stay in the human world and protect this group of innocent and lively children with no selfishness.</p>

<h3 id="e212">Conflicting Financial News, Chaotic Gold Standard Pricing – Ended with a Rebound of More Than Two Yuan – Once Reached a New Price of 741.5 Yuan in the Morning Session – Suspension of Silver Purchases Triggers Large Buying Volume <a href="#e212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday in the gold market, the opening was due to another surge in foreign silver and Sassoon's continued heavy selling, leading to a new low of 741.5 yuan. Later, positive foreign news boosted buying, and short covering caused a sharp rebound. Initially, overseas telegrams reported that the British and American silver markets had surged across the board, and speculators were said to have bought in at 3.75 higher than the closing price. Deferred silver prices in Monterey all rose by three-tenths of a cent, which was due to the limit on price increases. Exchange rates continued to shrink, and London raw gold rose by 4.5 pence, making it difficult for people to remain calm. Pre-market trading opened and immediately broke into the 60 yuan range, with sellers gathering due to the crowded long positions overnight. Before long, it broke through the 50 yuan mark again. The Central Bank's posted prices were announced, with increases in both British and American currencies, and the Customs Gold Unit fell by 1.6 li, with the gold standard price retreating to 832.8 yuan. The morning opened with a low price, and although there was struggle after the opening, the banks' appetite tended to shrink, and the exchange market hardened, gradually falling from outside the 50 yuan mark. Sassoon came with another heavy selling, making people even more fearful and creating a new low price of 741.5 yuan. After the low price, buyers became active, allowing it to be maintained. A United Press report said that it was difficult to predict whether the US government would further increase silver purchase prices, and that it would not be announced today but tomorrow. After this, although it rose, it was still consolidating, and later, China suddenly covered their forward shillings. A Reuters report said that although the silver factions in Congress strongly supported increasing the silver price to 84.4 cents, this statement was currently difficult to predict. Senator King, after meeting with the Secretary of the Treasury, said that speculators were raising the silver market too sharply and should be controlled, and suggested that the government stop silver purchases or restrict speculation. There were also reports that although the US Silver Corporation had set the silver price at 81 cents today, it was finally sold at a price of 79.65 cents with no buyers, triggering a buying frenzy, immediately breaking out of the 60 yuan range. Sassoon still had some selling, and it once fell back, but people's minds had already turned to a rebound, and short positions were actively covered. The exchange market gradually tightened, and the market had a shortage of chips. The Dalian gang came out and then went back in, and the rising momentum became even more intense, almost approaching the 70 yuan mark before slightly consolidating. The market situation was chaotic in the morning, and the future was still difficult to determine. Trading was quite active, reaching over 70,000 contracts. Here is a record of the market situation in the morning:</p>
<p>The morning opened at 749.5 yuan, down 15.4 yuan from the previous close. Wanfeng Hengyu rose from 9 yuan to 52 yuan. Fuxing Yongda, Fuyong Hengyu, Huixiang and others sold and dropped to 49.2 yuan. Yingxiang Hengyu retail investors still advanced to 52 yuan. Dalu Youli sold May shillings at 6.875. Fuxing Yongyong, Yingxiang Chunyuan, Yongwanxing Yuan, Yidelichang, Dada Decheng sold contracts and dropped to 45.5 yuan. Hengyu Fuxing Yongfu Yu Naji dropped to 8 yuan.

It was anticipated that the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation's official rates would be announced, with the pound rising by 25/10000 and the dollar rising by 375/10000.

However, due to Sassoon's continued selling pressure, the Silver Equalization Tax was announced without change, and the market remained somewhat loose. Later, Chinese banks came to buy in large quantities. Reuters reported that the US President, due to speculators raising silver prices excessively, seemed to have no intention of further increasing silver prices. Although the American Silver Company set today's silver price at 81 cents, it would sell at 79 cents but did not find buyers. The sentiment of Chinese merchants turned reactionary. Although Sassoon was still selling heavily, the process gradually tightened. By the noon close, near-term selling prices were one shilling eight and 4375/10000 and 1/2 pence for the British pound and 41.0625 yuan for the US dollar, a flat pound and a tightening of 125/10000 for the dollar compared to the previous close.

<p>Recently, the financial community has largely concluded long-term transactions, and credit has gradually become more active. Coupled with the government's implementation of relief measures, there is no longer a feeling of a lack of funds. The interbank overnight loan rate still opened at 15% in the morning, but the "chop head" interest plus watered-down interest rates have thus gradually fallen. Although the market opened at 15% initially, it was soon changed to 10%, and then to 8%, which is 7% lower than the previous day. In terms of bill trading, over 3.4 million was transferred in the morning session, with over 200,000 in new transactions, over 400,000 in the afternoon session, over 300,000 in the small clearinghouse, over 500,000 was redeemed in foreign collateral loans, and over 1.2 million in new loans were made.

<h3 id="e215">Securities: June Contracts Fall Immediately Upon Launch <a href="#e215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the June contracts of the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange began trading. Due to rampant rumors in the daily newspapers, sentiment turned weak, and selling pressure was quite strong. Trading gradually became lively. The June futures contracts were fully traded in the opening session. Nos. 47, 53, and 78, as well as the Northern Gang, were selling. Inbound orders remained scattered and unfounded. The rumors were said to be untrue or had already passed. Market sentiment was nothing more than fear-mongering, and short sellers were in fact covering their positions. The situation remained one of half-belief and half-doubt. The future still holds changes, but it also depends on whether there are changes in the environment. Yesterday's activity: the Northern Gang sold as soon as the market opened in the morning. The front-month contracts remained flat, showing slight signs of fatigue. As soon as the close was announced, the downward trend intensified, with most contracts falling by 50-60 cents. In the second session, the front-month contracts recovered slightly by 10-20 cents. Contracts after the 20th contract, due to the large decline in the opening session, recovered by 10-30 cents. When the market opened in the afternoon, No. 53 and others still sold aggressively, and the market weakened again by 10-20 cents. At the close, the market recovered slightly by 5-20 cents. The trading floor seemed to be stabilizing, but the trend was in fact brewing for change. The environmental situation regarding the rise and fall of the bond market is extremely complex. The future of the bond market is still unpredictable. The market results, except for the newly opened June contracts, saw the May contracts mostly fall by 10-20 cents to 50 cents. The total transaction volume was 14,675,000 yuan. A comparative table of the results of the price increases and decreases is shown on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan).</p>

<p>After the sharp decline in the yarn market on the previous day, it rebounded slightly today. Although silver is still rising sharply, local sentiment remains stable. Furthermore, it is said on the market that a certain firm purchased a large amount when prices fell on the previous two days, acting as an agent for the Indian merchant George Chih-fu. It is said that the amount of yarn in his account has reached over 10,000 bales, but this remains to be confirmed.</p>
<p>Spun Yarn Recovers by About One Yuan</p>
<p>The opening market for spun yarn saw continued pressure from sellers in the current month, so prices continued to fall. However, the prices of distant months rose slightly. Sellers in the market seemed to be waiting and hesitant. Although the benchmark price fell rapidly at the opening, the market suddenly tightened during the second and third sessions. It was widely said that the yarn purchased in large quantities by a certain broker on the previous two days was entrusted by the Indian merchant George Chih-fu. As a result, sentiment was greatly shaken, and buying sentiment suddenly became strong. Floating traders covered their positions firmly, and the result was that each month rose by 4, 6, and 9 "jiao" compared to the previous month's close. In the afternoon, it was heard that the gold market closed higher, exceeding the previous day's closing price. Short sellers rushed to cover their positions, but the market weakened slightly during the third session. As a result, the current month fell by 1 "jiao" compared to the morning close, while distant months rose by 1, 2, and 3 "jiao." Sales included: Da Ji 1,400 bales, He Xing 400 bales, Geng Feng 1,900 bales, Chang Feng 800 bales, De Ji 400 bales, Yuan Da 450 bales, Tai Chang 550 bales, and Ji Feng 400 bales. Purchases included: Da Fu 2,500 bales, Tong Ji 700 bales, Zhen Da 450 bales, Yuan Yi 700 bales, Yi Chang 850 bales, Da Xu 500 bales, He Xing 950 bales, Shen Ji 900 bales, and Chang Feng 1,050 bales.

<h3 id="e218">Expectations of Silver Price Decline: Raw Cotton Suddenly Rises on Short Covering <a href="#e218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>After the sharp decline in the cotton market, there is a rebound. Although overseas silver markets continue to soar, commodity prices are gradually rising. American cotton rose by 25 points, Indian cotton rose by 6 rupees, and the gold market rose after falling, so sentiment is higher and the market is more stable. It is found that the ranks of both bulls and bears are shortening.</p>
<p>Raw Cotton Resists the Decline and Rises on Short Covering</p>
<p>Before the opening of the raw cotton market, most people on the market expected prices to continue to fall, because silver had risen sharply by 300 pounds and the benchmark price had fallen by more than 10 yuan, making it difficult to break even. Unexpectedly, at the opening, there was a lack of supply from sellers, and the market reversed and rose slightly. The market became more dull during the second and third sessions. As a result, prices for each month rose by 15-25 cents compared to the previous month's close. In the afternoon, it was heard that the gold price closed at 67 yuan in the morning, exceeding the previous day's price. This was because the American silver price closed at 81 cents, and after the market closed, it was willing to sell at 140 pounds lower than the listed price. As a result, sentiment turned better, and it was expected that today's silver price would shrink. Chang Feng, Chang He, and He Xing, short sellers covered their positions, and the market suddenly tightened, rising by another 15 cents. However, the market weakened again for distant months at the close. As a result, prices for each month rose by 5 cents compared to the morning close, and the current month fell by 1 "jiao".

<p>Yesterday, the American cotton market opened with active trading and a bullish trend. Prices for each month rose by 8-12 points. Continental banks and the Far East were engaged in trade due to the rise in silver prices. Later, the market weakened slightly due to some bulls taking profits and official denials of delivering spot cotton to New England yarn mills. Ultimately, there were few sellers, so the industry was trading old cotton and brokers were trading distant months. The wheat market was strong, and short sellers covered their positions, so the market rebounded again. Current demand is sluggish, but the fundamentals are solid. The state of the textile industry is bleak. The market closed firmly. Spot prices rose by 25 points, and futures prices rose by 12-17 points. Hester's estimate for this week's factory consumption is 148,000 bales, and Liverpool's inventory is 269,000 bales. It is found that the current market is approaching the price that the government previously claimed it would not sell below. The government has not yet announced its attitude towards lending on new cotton, so it seems that the price of new cotton is already very high. Talk of inflation has risen again, and efforts to cancel or continue taxes are ongoing. British cotton spot prices rose by 13 points, and futures prices rose by 6-7 points. Indian cotton rose due to strong silver prices and bullish buying, with the following results: Pingguore rose by 5.5-6 rupees, Omu La rose by 6 rupees, and Bai Luo Creek rose by 5.5-6.5 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (telegram from the 26th).</p>

<h3 id="e220">Grain: Wheat Prices Cannot Be Easily Undervalued - With International Affairs, Food is Important <a href="#e220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, wheat market prices for each month initially stabilized and continued to rise. With imported wheat quotations, Chicago rose by about 7-8 cents, and Canada rose by about 4-5 cents. When prices were opened, imported wheat rebounded significantly. Although the gold market saw a sharp drop again, people did not pay attention, because the international reefs are becoming deeper and deeper, and future food will naturally be the main commodity. The stability of people's minds is probably for this reason. The opening prices for July and August were initially stable, and then held firm. By the time the market opened in the afternoon, trading was very active, and prices rarely fluctuated. With the large increase in the exchange rate, people could not help but worry about this. From this, it can be seen that it is not easy for prices to rise excessively. As a result, July rose by 4 cents, and August and September rose by 5 cents. The current wheat market is temporarily stable. However, it is said that the imported wheat ordered by major factories will soon arrive in four large ships, and future price quotations may need to be adjusted. The opening prices were 3.96 yuan for Kaifeng Shandong wheat, 3.83 yuan for Haizhou wheat, 3.95 yuan for Bengbu wheat, 3.86-3.87 yuan for Luohe wheat, 3.88 yuan for Jiangbei wheat, followed by 3.85 yuan, with 4,000 bags going to Fufeng and 2,000 bags going to Fuxin.</p>
<p>Chicago wheat market conditions were driven higher by continued gains in silver prices, strong foreign markets, and renewed reports of windstorms. Spot demand is sluggish, and there is a trend of increased acreage for spring wheat cultivation.</p>

<h3 id="e221">Current Month Flour Heavily Short Covering <a href="#e221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday in the flour market, prices for each month were initially flat and then stable. With imported wheat quotations, Chicago rebounded by about 7-8 cents and Canada rebounded by about 4-5 cents. After the opening prices, although the gold market saw a large decline, the foreign wheat prices were expected to rise, so sentiment was initially stable. Then, with very few sellers and customers remaining firm, the quotations for each month improved step by step. The current month was also close to delivery, and factory short sellers could not easily cover their positions, and floating short sellers had to cover them. So the opening prices felt particularly tight. By the time the market opened in the afternoon, trading in the current month had become light, and the market was stable. The distant months initially remained stable, but then loosened slightly due to factory sales. According to speculation among outsiders, the exchange rate will loosen greatly afterwards, and selling imported wheat again will be inevitable. Perhaps the arrival of the falling wind will be at this point. As a result, the current month rose by 2.25 cents, May rose by 1.75 cents, June rose by 1.75 cents, July rose by 1 cent, August rose by 1.25 cents, and September rose by 1.5 cents.</p>
<h3 id="e222">Rice Prices: Weak in the South, Strong in the North; Soybean Market Almost No Transactions <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>Japonica rice from Shanghai's southern sources arrived in only about twenty-odd shipments yesterday (totaling nearly 4,000 shi), and sales were sluggish, whether wholesale or retail. Very few transactions were opened for each type of rice, making it difficult for the market to show improvement. A trend of stabilization with slight softness was observed. The prices of both thick and thin japonica rice had already been reduced by several fen. Given the abundant stockpiles in the port and the unusually volatile market conditions, a positive outlook for the future is unlikely. The price of silver taels remained relatively stable. From Shanghai's northern sources, there were seventeen or eighteen shipments. On the market, shipments of white japonica rice saw some movement, and transactions for early thin japonica rice were quite active. Other types of rice were normal. The market price of white japonica rice increased slightly by several fen, and the price of early thin japonica rice increased by several fen to one jiao. Silver taels turned stable, and the prices of other types of rice remained firm.</p>
<p>The market for foreign indica rice has revived. Foreign rice is being shipped inland, with recent shipments not only drawing from existing stockpiles but also with merchants directly distributing to customers. Over the past two days, rice shops like Zhongshan Changyi distributed over 30,000 packages to the Hangzhou-Shaoxing area, and various regions in Jiangsu and Zhejiang also directly received shipments. The total volume was also around 40,000 to 50,000 packages. Therefore, market transactions have slightly decreased, with yesterday's total transactions falling short of 10,000 packages. However, the market remains stable due to sustained real demand. There was also some speculative buying and reselling of future foreign rice, with 1,200 tons of cargo in transit, mostly destined inland. Future rice and some foreign rice were handled by local businesses. Recently, the price of gold has fallen, potentially allowing for a slight reduction in the production price of foreign rice. However, local rice prices are rising, making the price difference similar. Yesterday, customer indica rice was actively purchased for inland regions, and with low inventory levels, 2,000 packages were sold at a price increase of two or three fen.</p>
<p>Due to sellers' unwillingness to sell at low prices and buyers' reluctance to pay high prices, the soybean market entered a wait-and-see mode. Some inland and local small millers were active, opening transactions for 200 packages of Dalian Sipingjie soybeans at a price of four yuan and four jiao seven fen, and 500 packages of Hankou zha beans at a price of three yuan eight jiao one fen to eight jiao. 320 packages of Hankou gou beans were traded at a price of four yuan zero eight fen to four yuan.</p>

<p>Tea merchants have received the news that Keemun black tea opening prices were set yesterday. The price for superior Dafang Gaozhuang tea was reported at eighty yuan, and the price for Keemun County tea was set at sixty yuan.

<p>Yesterday, the sugar market saw continued sharp declines in customs gold, reaching as low as 1.610, leading to further weakening and continued price drops. The association set the price for 24 coarse white sugar at sixteen yuan and seven jiao, a decrease of three jiao. Spot re-exports were priced at five yuan and four jiao, a decrease of one jiao, and forward contracts at five yuan and two jiao five fen, but no transactions occurred. Guangdong coarse white sugar was priced at sixteen yuan and seven jiao, with some sales. The factory's refined white sugar fell another two jiao, with Zhenyu No. 1 at sixteen yuan three jiao, No. 2 at two jiao, No. 3 at zero five fen, and No. 4 at fifteen yuan nine jiao. For future contracts, Dutch coarse white sugar for May arrival was opened by Dachangji last night for 2,000 packages at three yuan one jiao three fen. The price of Dutch shield remained unchanged. Chaoqing sugar, due to a further decrease of over ten yuan in Shantou exchange rates, reached one thousand and three yuan, leading to an increased cost of several jiao and further divergence from the Shanghai market. Branded goods are holding firm.</p>

<h3 id="e225">Men and Women Competing for Occupations <a href="#e225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Yan</p>
<p>In truly feudal societies, women were entirely slaves to their families. Their livelihoods were determined by "obeying their fathers when young, their husbands when grown, and their sons when widowed." Their life and death were entirely controlled by these men, with no direct connection to society. However, the massive influx of foreign capitalism shattered our dilapidated and backward screens. Rural areas went bankrupt, and the large family system collapsed. Years of internal and external troubles have fulfilled the proverb of "nine out of ten houses empty." Therefore, despite one side advocating for virtuous wives and good mothers, urging "Nora" to return home, the fathers, husbands, or sons upon whom women depended for life and death were being cast aside from the production line in nine out of ten households. In this situation, women had no choice but to enter society in search of survival.</p>
<p>On the other hand, factory owners and merchants sought profit. Thus, they happily employed women who were cheaper and more hard-working and compliant than male workers—women who were previously only fit to be household slaves. Female clerks, in addition to the above conditions, further leveraged their looks as live advertisements to attract customers. This has precedents in various countries. China is also heading down this path. The problem that arises here is the competition for jobs between men and women. According to a report in the Sino-Japanese Daily on the 20th of this month, there is news of occupational conflict between male and female waiters in Guangzhou restaurants and tea houses: The Guangzhou Restaurant and Tea House Workers' Union recently petitioned the government to prohibit the employment of female waitresses in city restaurants and tea houses, arguing that they were seizing jobs and affecting the livelihoods of union members. This attracted the attention of the Women's Association, leading to a dispute. According to Ms. Peng of the Women's Association, "Women's liberation aims to achieve equal education and economic independence. Economic independence depends on occupation. Women can fill any occupation that men can fill. European and American countries have absolutely no restrictions on women's occupations. The women's rights movement in this province is just beginning to sprout, and women's occupations are gradually expanding, such as female civil servants in government agencies, school teachers, hospital doctors and nurses, ushers in entertainment venues... All have women in these roles. Anyone with a clear understanding of global trends should promote women's occupations to foster mutual assistance between husband and wife. The Restaurant and Tea House Workers' Union considers the employment of female waitresses as seizing jobs, which shows a lack of understanding of the trend of the women's rights movement... We are all human beings. We should only ask whether they have the skills to perform the job, and there should be no distinction based on gender. Our late Premier advocated for equality between men and women and the promotion of women's rights, and this is clearly stipulated in the party platform. Our association, as the leading organization for women from all walks of life, believes that this matter hinders the development of women's occupations and will fight for women's rights based on reason in the coming days." The labor union committee, on the other hand, said, "The number of unemployed restaurant and tea house workers has reached over five or six thousand. Female waitresses rely on their looks to cater to the psychology of customers. They have no specialized skills or business experience for restaurant and tea house work and are merely used by profit-seekers to exploit social weaknesses to attract customers. The result is only the trampling of women, creating social unrest. In fact, the issue of promoting women's occupations needs to be carefully considered, including which jobs are suitable for women and which can lead to their downfall. This issue is extremely important. Therefore, our association's opposition to female waitresses is not to suppress the development of women's rights but to protect the job security of our union members and indirectly improve the status of women. It is purely a matter of morality." Therefore, their petition to the five party and government agencies contains even more wonderful phrases, such as "At a time when we are promoting old morals and saving declining customs, we must not allow cunning merchants to pursue only personal gain, creating abnormal development and causing social disputes."</p>
<p>After reading the above excerpts from speeches and petitions, it seems that everyone has their own reasons, and both sides are justified. As for who will ultimately win, it is difficult to predict at this time. However, in recent years, a wave of revivalism has swept through Guangdong. The union is seizing on the authorities' mentality of promoting old morals, and perhaps another ban will be issued, granting them a temporary victory? However, as the economic downturn intensifies, businesses, in addition to closing down, must struggle to survive and will seek profitable avenues, regardless of how strict the bans may be, and will sometimes try to implement them secretly. It has been previously decreed in Guangdong to prohibit the employment of female waitresses in restaurants and tea houses. The fact that female waitresses are now being rehired is clear evidence. On the surface, it seems that the final victory will ultimately belong to the Women's Association. However, it is necessary to say a word to the women's rights movement: this kind of dispute can be seen as an anti-revivalist movement, but the ultimate goal of the women's movement is not merely to compete with men for occupations. Instead, it should be based on the entire social and economic problem, seeking true equality between men and women.</p>

<h3 id="e226">Section 2: Feudal Housewives and Marriage <a href="#e226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>— Jun Hui</p>
<p>The feudal state, built upon the labor of serfs, was necessarily a deliberative body of lords, nobles, monks, and bureaucrats. To plunder the wealth of neighboring countries, to suppress the rebellions of serfs, and, more importantly, to legally and limitlessly exploit the masses of peasants, the state apparatus was endowed with absolute autocratic power, and the wielders of this power were the lords. However, to exercise their autocratic power, lords needed a certain legal and moral order, which gave rise to feudal codified law and moral codes. This law naturally presupposed absolute subordination. In other words, there were certain legal and moral relationships of subordination among adults, between men and women, between parents and children, and between elders and juniors. The most typical features of this were the feudal status system and the feudal moral codes that oppressed women.</p>
<p>The status system was a system used by feudal states to regulate the status of people of all social classes through law. For example, lords, nobles, monks, merchants, artisans, and serfs all had certain social statuses, as well as certain top-down relations of domination. There were clear distinctions in their family, religious, moral, educational, and all social lives. For example, a merchant could not sit in the chair reserved for nobles, could not receive the education of nobles, and, more importantly, could not marry into the nobility. Under this system, the family life and marriage forms of the various social classes naturally differed greatly. I would like to briefly describe here the lives of women of lords, peasants, and merchants and artisans.</p>
<p>First of all, the lord's family fully reflected the characteristics of his social status. To maintain power over his subjects and people, the lord needed to strengthen his patriarchal authority. He held the power of life and death over his family, transforming his children into property, transforming them into non-personal objects. However, as the lord's constant work was war and plunder, he had to entrust domestic affairs to his most trusted wife. Thus, the lord's wife, in the capacity of the mistress of the house, managed the organization of production, the collection of taxes, the storage of grain, and various other household affairs. This mistress had the right to harshly exploit the serfs and to execute unceremonious punishments. However, she was in an inhuman position, similar to that of a serf, towards her husband, the lord.</p>
<p>Marriage in the lord's family was thoroughly predicated on the interests of the family. In detail, the marriage between lords and nobles was a kind of contract for political and economic purposes. In order to conclude a solid alliance, to increase the family's economic strength, and, more importantly, to guarantee military security, one could marry one's young daughter to an old lord in a neighboring region. Personal love and desire had to be sacrificed under the great premise of family interests. Engels said:</p>
<p>"For the nobility and the knights, as for the ruling monarchs, marriage was a political act, a transaction by which their power was to be increased through new alliances; the interests of the dynasty, not those of the individual, were decisive."</p>
<p>This strategic marriage gave rise to the bad habit of early marriage. Early betrothals were prevalent among noble families in medieval Europe. A countess betrothed her young daughter to the heir of the German duchy of Berthold, and the bride and groom were not even six years old. This bad habit can still be seen in our country today.</p>
<p>Secondly, the women of peasant families participated in all productive labor just like serfs, but the feudal moral concept of male superiority also dominated their lives, and peasant women became serfs of serfs. However, their marriage and family relations were often directly dominated by the lord. The lord regarded the marriage between serfs as a means of increasing his own labor force. On this basis of interest, he would directly handle their marriage. Seshukav said:</p>
<p>"They (the lords) regarded the marriage of peasants in the same way as the mating of horses and dogs to breed offspring and bring benefits to the lord."</p>
<p>In this way, the lord could forcibly marry farmers over the age of eighteen and farm women over the age of fourteen, because they keenly felt that the increase in the number of serfs was the source of their increased benefits. Furthermore, feudal law not only gave the lord the right to arbitrarily dispose of the labor and property of peasants, but even gave him the possibility of extensive sexual coercion. This point will be detailed in the "First Night Right" section.</p>
<p>Finally, the families of merchants and artisans were the predecessors of modern bourgeois families. In the closed natural economy era of the Middle Ages, specialist occupations in handicrafts and commerce arose under the cities where the lords lived to supply the needs of the lords. Although they were under the domination of the lords just like the serfs, their lifestyles had already adopted progressive forms. Their family forms and the status of women will be described in detail in the sixth lecture. Due to space constraints, no further explanation can be given here.</p>
<h3 id="e227">After Watching the Play *Wu Song* <a href="#e227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>— Bi Yao</p>
<p>It has been ten years since I last watched traditional opera. Last Saturday night, at the invitation of a friend, I stepped into a certain theater. At that time, the red, white, blue, and black faces on the stage, dragging long pheasant feathers, were rushing back and forth. Knowing that they were acting out some kind of occupational dispute, I closed my eyes and tried to imagine the crude lifestyle of the ancient past.</p>
<p>After a while, Wu Song was brought out on stage, and the audience burst into enthusiastic cheers. The hero who had fought the tiger at Jingyang Ridge still had such power! But as I watched, I realized that the most cheers were not for the tiger-fighting scene, but for Wu Song's accusation of Pan Jinlian's flirtation with him and later for the killing of Pan Jinlian. This seemed to prove that Pan Jinlian was more hateful than the man-eating tiger, and that Wu Song was a hero especially because he could resolutely kill a charming adulteress. Is the psychology of the audience really so incomprehensible?</p>
<p>In all fairness, the enchanting young woman Pan Jinlian, being married to an ugly and foolish husband, flirting with Wu Song, and having an affair with Ximen Qing were not big deals. As for the later poisoning of Wu Dalang, it was only the social environment that forced her to do so. However, she unfortunately met Wu Song, who was pretentious for the sake of empty fame. First, he confessed the hidden affair to Wu Dalang, and then he cut off Pan Jinlian's head with one stroke. Finally, because of the Water Margin's painstaking efforts to portray national heroes, she became Wu Song's foil and became the archetype of a thousand-year-old adulteress. What else is there to say about these past events of feudal society?</p>
<p>However, in recent years, feudal ideas have been stirred up again like old wells. In today's society, from rural villages to major cities, an unknown number of women die from this every day. At the same time, tragedies of rape and murder and wife-killing are constantly emerging. And in Xiamen, there was even a father who reported his daughter's adultery, leading to his daughter's suicide! These heroes and good men can all be placed in Wu Song's ancestral hall. But if the incense of this ancestral hall is prosperous, women will have no survivors, which is very clear.</p>
<p>Art, with its underlying ideology, influences society, and its power is certainly greater than that of laws. The play "Wu Song" particularly emphasizes the depiction of Pan Jinlian's seductive licentiousness and Wu Song's upright extraordinariness. The emotions of the audience have been captured by it. In addition to following the right and wrong of the plot, what else can they think? I remember two years ago when I watched "Roar, China!" the cheers from the audience were far greater than those in the current "Wu Song" scene. At that time, when many male and female workers fought to the death against the imperialists, the audience was simply a chorus of hoarse cries. That kind of intense and great righteous indignation should be higher than Wu Song's killing of his sister-in-law.</p>
<p>However, old plays like "Wu Song" which contain feudal consciousness, are performed anytime, anywhere, while new plays like "Roar, China!" which can arouse national struggle, are as rare as phoenix feathers and unicorn horns, one in a hundred. Isn't that strange? The most touching stage art closes off the side of liberation, and only old plays with feudal consciousness are dancing around there. In today's world of the dead acting strange, how can the audience not be even more drunk and confused when they are immersed in this aged Shaoxing wine day and night?</p>
<h3 id="e228">The Dead End of Japanese Intellectual Women <a href="#e228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>— Wu</p>
<p>The Osaka Asahi Shimbun on the 19th of this month reported: The standards Japanese employers use to select maids mostly favor those who are graduates of higher elementary schools, healthy, of amiable disposition, and have reliable guarantors. In addition, those who have worked as female entertainers or female workers, those who have not graduated from higher elementary school, those who are frail, those with family burdens, etc., are all disliked by employers. In particular, those who have graduated from middle school are most rejected by employers. The reason is that after graduating from middle school, they inevitably become ambitious and arrogant, and it is not easy for employers to control them.</p>
<p>From this piece of news, we can see the difficulties of Japanese women's lives. The duration of compulsory education in Japan is six years, plus four years of middle school, a woman who graduates from middle school has studied for ten years. However, middle school graduates can only be servants! Being a servant is certainly not what they want, but there is no other way to go, so they can only be servants. But employers are so harsh. This is truly the dead end of Japanese intellectual women!</p>

<p>Spring, that lovely spring is already over. In that happy spring, some people were happy, some were in pain; some were in paradise, some were in prison. Some were free, some were slaves. I was in prison, acting as a slave, and spent that spring that others were happy in. No, all women are just like me. And there are those women who are even worse off than me who can't find food to eat!</p>
<p>The child cries every day, opening her mouth to look for milk to eat. She wants to live, to grow. She is not yet aware that she will grow into an unfortunate woman!</p>
<p>June 13th</p>
<p>These days I myself have no milk, and it's hard to hire a nanny who isn't fussy, and the child is sick. I also heard that Chief × wants us to leave the hospital in the next few days and move into the newly rented house: fortunately, the doctor told him. I and the child are not well, and there is a risk to our lives if we leave the hospital now, so Chief × didn't send anyone to urge us to leave.</p>
<p>In this society, women belong to men, and children belong to their parents. Women abandoned by men have nowhere to go, and children who are not cared for by their parents cannot grow up!</p>
<p>I remember hearing someone tell a story, saying that in some societies, women can live in society without relying on men and do things for society; they are also free to fall in love at any time. Children without parents also have state organs to support them and raise them to adulthood. But I heard it as a story, and some people say it's a fact, but I think no matter how empty the theory is, it's reasonable, and everyone should do it this way. According to what I've seen before, those charity halls and orphanages are useless. How many women who can't survive and children who wander and die number in the tens of millions every year?</p>
<p>June 17th</p>
<p>I've been dreaming these past few nights: dreaming that I'm very free, I run to an agency, and I do all the things I usually do for the people at that agency to see. They welcome me very much, saying that they want to send my child to a very good foster home, and they want me to work for them there. They pay me a salary every month; I can also visit my child during my breaks and buy her toys and candy with the money I earn. When I'm having such a dream, I'm always disturbed by a strange sound, which turns out to be the child crying beside me.</p>
<p>Now I'm sick, so sick that I can hardly move; but if that paradise I dreamed of can really be created, I'll get up even if I'm sick to participate in the creation, even if I die for work, it's good to make later women happy!</p>
<p>June 19th</p>
<p>Yesterday, because my temperature was too high, I said everything I was thinking about in a muddled way. The doctor therefore said that my nerves were a little abnormal. I don't think I've gone crazy, but I'm thinking too far ahead. What I think is right, people say is crazy. No, it's just that men think it's crazy. Many women haven't said that my ideas are crazy!</p>
<p>Today's diary is not finished, and the doctor sent someone to take away my pen. He insisted that my nerves had undergone abnormal changes and wanted me to rest without thinking at all!</p>
<p>Okay! You took my pen away, and that's your victory. Anyway, it's your world, and it's not fun to live in other people's worlds. Of course, I can't write a diary anymore. Now there's nothing else but for me to rest and recuperate well. When I get better, I'll settle accounts with you! After I settle accounts, I'll never be a patient or a concubine again! (The End)</p>
<h3 id="e230">Denunciation <a href="#e230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>— Lin Yun</p>
<p>The women's umbrella has only just barely managed to peek its head out from under the heavy oppression of thousands of years. This tiny, newly growing bud, still swaying uncertainly, needs doubled cultivation and maintenance. Absolutely no one should be allowed, under the guise of the women's movement, to actually destroy the growth of the women's movement and increase obstacles to women's future.</p>
<p>Opening our eyes, we see this women's magazine in the east and that women's publication in the west. It seems the women's movement is really flourishing, and the number of women's publications is increasing day by day. But slow down and don't get too excited. Everyone needs to examine them first.</p>
<p>The cover is printed with a large photograph of a woman with a seductive and charming face. Inside, it teaches women how to apply rouge, manicure their nails, and how to be charming. It also tells women which foreign brands of expensive perfume to buy. The rest consists of semi-nude pictures of women, photos of foreign movie stars, and a few erotic novels written in a "neither Chinese nor Western" style, specially prepared for men to enjoy. There are also essays telling Chinese women to catch up with the trends of modern European and American ladies. This is what is called a publication that makes women into "modern toys." There are also weekly women's periodicals, women's weekly supplements in newspapers, and miscellaneous writings about women...etc. Generally, they are nothing more than: how to cook and eat certain dishes, how to be obedient and please one's husband, so-called "husband-taming techniques," "new women's precepts," etc., teaching women to be ancient women at home, but when their husbands take them out, they must be modern women in their dress and attitude, so that their husbands' faces will shine. Otherwise, it will hurt their husbands' faces. It is a pity that it has not yet said that women should best become "Bailing machines," becoming whatever they are told to become, then the husband will really like it! Some indulge in mocking and scolding women, saying that women are trouble, that women are weak and do not strive for self-improvement, that women are born cheap, superstitious, and that women are really as cheap as dog bones, as they describe. Fortunately, women never pay attention to outside affairs, so even if they are scolded harshly, no one comes to refute them. Some point out that the ultimate path of the women's movement and women's careers is "marriage," and still attach the lock of "virtue"... A dazzling array of things, all in the name of women, but in reality, they are of no benefit to women. At the same time, for those women whose wills are not yet firm and who are struggling in hardship, they are nothing more than a kind of anesthesia and deceptive tricks of the ghosts.</p>
<p>We see in the daily newspapers that countless women are being abused by men, exploited by society, and wandering, suffering, and dying! Women have become extremely fragile due to thousands of years of unequal treatment, and can only be slaughtered and trampled on. Now that a little bud seems to have been exposed, how can we sit idly by and watch people release poisoned arrows without regard?</p>
<p>Compatriots, quickly rise up and denounce those publications that act in the name of women but actually harm the interests of women!</p>

<h3 id="e231">The Year-Round Hired Hand <a href="#e231" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c231" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">231</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Lin</p>
<p>In my hometown, there are two kinds of farmers: one is called "Zero-Work," meaning farmers who do not usually work for others, but are only hired to do things during the busy farming season; the other is called "Year-Round Hired Hand," meaning farmers who live in the landlord's house all year round, working for the landlord from morning till night. However, those who do "Zero-Work" mostly have a little land of their own. They take time out from their busy work to help others. The "Year-Round Hired Hands" are different. They have no land of their own, no property. All they have is a strong body and amazing strength. They work for others all month and all year. Therefore, strictly speaking, only the "Year-Round Hired Hands" can be called 100% tenant farmers. "Zero-Work" cannot be counted.</p>
<p>Originally, those who live in other people's houses and work for others all year round also include the "Second-in-Command" and the "Cowherd." But the "Second-in-Command" is helping the senior "Year-Round Hired Hand," not the main character, only a supporting role. The "Cowherd" is only a thirteen or fourteen-year-old child whose main job is to graze cattle, feed pigs, and do other odd jobs. They can be said to be the "junior class." Moreover, the "Second-in-Command" and the "Cowherd" work for others all month and all year round, so of course they can also be called "Year-Round Hired Hands." Therefore, the "Year-Round Hired Hands" are actually representatives of the tenant farmers. As long as we know the living conditions of the "Year-Round Hired Hands," we can imagine everything about the general tenant farmers, such as the "Second-in-Command" and the "Cowherd."</p>
<p>The work of the "Year-Round Hired Hands" is set in the last lunar month of the previous year. So every "Year-Round Hired Hand Erwa" (because their social status is very low, so people generally add the title "Erwa" after the words "Year-Round Hired Hand" to call them "Year-Round Hired Hand Erwa" to show their difference from "Old Master," "Great Sir," etc.) has to go to the rural market towns in the last lunar month to "be active," buying the landlords a couple of liang of shaojiu, relying on their strength, and relying on their simple and honest "nature" to obtain the "job" (meaning work) for the coming year. If the job for the coming year is secured, then their life for the year can be considered to have a "guarantee" so that there will be no danger of starvation. If, unfortunately, they have not secured a job for the coming year by the thirtieth day of the last lunar month, then they will face the terrible danger of unemployment, not knowing how to spend the year to come. Therefore, we can say that the fate of the "Year-Round Hired Hand Erwa" is decided in the last lunar month of each year.</p>
<p>Now, the annual wages of the "Year-Round Hired Hands" in my hometown are roughly more than two hundred thousand copper coins. If this were in Shanghai, more than one hundred thousand copper coins could be equivalent to about one hundred silver dollars. The "Year-Round Hired Hands" live in the landlord's house all year round and eat the landlord's food. If they have an income of about one hundred yuan a year and do not have to bear the cost of rent and food, then they can be considered to be able to make a living. However, the price of silver dollars in our hometown is so high that people sitting comfortably in Shanghai simply cannot imagine it. One silver dollar there can be exchanged for more than twenty thousand copper coins. So the "Year-Round Hired Hands" who have wages of more than two hundred thousand copper coins each year actually only have an income of about ten yuan each year. Even if they do not bear the cost of rent and food and do not have family burdens, ten yuan a year is not enough.</p>
<p>"Work at sunrise, rest at sunset, dig a well and drink, till the field and eat." It is said that this is where the happiness of ancient farmers lies. However, the "Year-Round Hired Hand Erwa" in my hometown now does not have any happiness. At ordinary times, they get up to work when the sky is bright. Except for eating, they are working in the fields all day long. When it comes to the season for sowing beans, they have to get up when the rooster crows, and after a quick breakfast, they have to go out to cultivate. At this time, the sun has not yet risen! During the autumn harvest, they are of course even busier and more bitter. Although it is autumn at this time, the sun is still as fierce as fire, and the weather is sometimes even hotter than summer. The work of the "Year-Round Hired Hand Erwa" in this hot weather is to carry water rice, that is, after many farmers in the paddy field beat the rice into a large wooden bucket, they use a basket to load it up, one load at a time. The "Year-Round Hired Hand Erwa" carries it back to the landlord's house. This kind of water rice cannot be said to be very heavy, but it cannot be said to be very light either, probably about two hundred jin per load. The strength of the "Year-Round Hired Hand Erwa" is of course much greater than yours and mine, so they can carry about two hundred jin of water rice all day long, without caring. In order to invigorate their bodies and liven up their hearts, the landlords specially prepare the best shaojiu and some side dishes such as pig ears and pig tongues for them at this time. Roughly, after they have carried two or three loads of water rice back, they can drink three cups of shaojiu. If we were to talk about happiness, it would probably be because they have shaojiu and pig ears to eat at this time, because these things are not easy for them to get at ordinary times.</p>
<p>However, we should not underestimate the "Year-Round Hired Hand Erwa" too much. Like you, he has blood, flesh, and feelings. And, whether you believe it or not, they also talk about love! It is very interesting to say that in our hometown, the general landlords, in addition to wanting more land and more longevity, also want more children and grandchildren. As soon as they have a son, they immediately want to have a grandson. As soon as their son is twelve or thirteen years old, they want to find a way to marry him a big girl of seventeen or eighteen or even twenty-odd years old, on the one hand to have a grandson sooner, and on the other hand to have one more person at home to use! This is indeed a win-win situation. The so-called "early marriage system" is formed in this way. This early marriage system is quite beneficial to the "Year-Round Hired Hand Erwa" because the big girl of seventeen or eighteen years old who becomes the wife of a twelve or thirteen-year-old child is certainly not satisfied. If she is not satisfied, she will seek another way out. As a result of seeking another way out, the strong and powerful "Year-Round Hired Hand Erwa" becomes the ideal lover. So the "Year-Round Hired Hand Erwa" who is not supposed to talk about love talks about his love. At the same time, the daughters of the landlords are locked up at home from childhood to adulthood and are not allowed to approach men. But precisely because they cannot approach men, problems easily occur as long as there is an opportunity to approach men. The "Year-Round Hired Hand Erwa" often enters and exits the landlord's door and is more likely to approach the landlord's daughters. As soon as they approach, love problems easily occur. It is said that six or seven out of ten of the landlord's daughters are in love with the "Year-Round Hired Hand Erwa"! However, our hometown is very feudal. If the "Year-Round Hired Hand Erwa" has a love affair with a young lady from a certain family, once discovered, the people of that family will rise up to put the "Year-Round Hired Hand Erwa" to death, or at least break his spine to make him a cripple forever! As for having a love affair with their daughter-in-law, that cannot be generalized, because the daughter-in-law comes from another family. Even if she has a love affair with the "Year-Round Hired Hand Erwa," it is only ruining the reputation of another family and has nothing to do with oneself. Moreover, the utilitarianism of the landlords in our hometown is still very thorough. As they see it, the child born from the love affair between the "Year-Round Hired Hand Erwa" and the daughter-in-law from another family is still the son of their son, still their grandson, and will never be taken away by the "Year-Round Hired Hand Erwa." Therefore, some landlords, when their sons are still incapable of doing anything, in order to have grandsons sooner, always pretend to be deaf and dumb about the love affair between the "Year-Round Hired Hand Erwa" and the daughter-in-law!</p>

<h3 id="e232">Elephant Hunting in Africa <a href="#e232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>— Du Bo</p>
<p>Tanta Communication from Egypt</p>
<p>The elephant is now the largest and most valuable animal on land. In China, except for one place in Yunnan that produces elephants, it is really not easy to see them elsewhere. But in Africa and India, elephants are as numerous as pigs. You can see them everywhere, whether in the countryside, in the fields, or on the streets.</p>
<p>African elephants are slightly different in shape from Indian elephants, so the methods of catching elephants are also different. African elephants have very large ears and long tusks, but they are very fierce. The captors often lose their lives if they are not careful and get flipped up by their noses. Indian elephants have small ears, only as big as a palm fan, and they are very docile. It does not take much effort to catch them. Moreover, almost all of these elephants are captured alive and can be kept as domestic animals.</p>
<p>There are roughly two methods of catching elephants in India. The first method is only applicable to the elephant mating season. They bring trained female elephants to the place where wild elephants are produced, and tie the four feet of the female elephant firmly with a very thick palm rope. The length of the rope is only enough for it to walk in a fixed area. In addition, many pitfalls are dug around the female elephant, and the pits are covered with leaves and palm ropes with slipknots. After arranging such a confusing array, the elephant hunters quickly hide in the forest to avoid the sight of the wild elephants.</p>
<p>After a while, wild elephants come walking from afar in groups of three or five or alone, thinking that the female elephant standing here is its mate. When they see that it is a female elephant, they simply rush to its side as eagerly as a horny man sees a slut, circling around it, making all kinds of frivolous and ugly gestures, and hooking up with it. In this moment of ecstatic forgetfulness, the elephant hunters fire a gun into the sky from the forest. With a "bang," the wild elephants are frightened and jump up in a panic. If they are not careful, their feet will step into</p>

<h3 id="e233">On Perseverance <a href="#e233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<p>— Li Aiting</p>
<p>Napoleon said: Victory often belongs to those with the most perseverance. Goldsmith said: Our greatest glory is not in maintaining perpetual failure, but in being able to rise again after each failure. Dr. Edison said: Perseverance is nineteen failures, and only success on the twentieth try. This is a fact that could not be more correct. If a person is born without the spirit of perseverance, wanting to fight against the environment, wanting to overcome all kinds of difficulties and achieve success, that would be no different from trying to climb a tree to catch fish. His lack of achievement is undeniable to anyone.</p>
<p>It is also a fact that a person often wants to make his career a success, but it is as if a demon is creating mischief in it. Not only is there no hope of success, but it leads to a complete defeat. Therefore, the person engaged in it inevitably becomes discouraged and falls into despair. In fact, after this effort and failure, the original substance of success has already been conceived. That is to say, if you can sacrifice a little bit and try harder, then success will immediately stand before you, and there will be no more room for hiding. Therefore, generally speaking, failure is really due to the lack of a spirit of perseverance. But what exactly is perseverance? We might as well give a definition. That is to say, the so-called perseverance is not a blind effort without a direction, but a kind of power that is formed by the combination of three things: purpose, ambition, and enthusiasm. Because when a person has a purpose, he can concentrate his power to devote himself to a certain career; when he has ambition, a kind of maintaining power can be generated for his plan; when he has enthusiasm, he can concentrate his energy to defeat all kinds of natural or man-made obstacles. These three conditions are all related to each other and absolutely cannot be separated arbitrarily. However, people in society who are generally engaged in careers, especially the impetuous young people who are new to society, often ignore this point, so that when they encounter difficulties, they lose the spirit of advancement, or even give up halfway, and finally achieve nothing, which is really a pity. At the same time, facts tell us that the use of perseverance is not only needed in a certain period of life or for a certain kind of thing, but there is a need for this spirit in any aspect. Because a person's life is just like a battlefield, inner impulses, the advantages and disadvantages of circumstances, etc., will often stimulate all kinds of fierce struggles in terms of will. At this time, if he can use perseverance to stimulate his brain and make him distinguish between right and wrong, good and evil, then he will not fall into the depths of depravity.</p>
<p>In the history books of ancient and modern times, I do not know how many successful great men their success never depended on chance, shortcuts, or good luck, but mostly on the spirit of perseverance. Here, we can cite two examples to prove the falsity of this statement. Peng Yang, who wrote Pilgrim's Progress, should be known to everyone! He wrote this book using the sealing paper on milk bottles. Another example is Dalais, who has become the giant in the shipping industry known to everyone today. At first, he only started with a small steamboat. I remember that Milton once said very thoroughly that the environment encountered by celebrities is mostly adverse, and that his ability to open up a path to success often requires many resistance and obstacles, so it is a great feat for a person to strive for success from the materials he has obtained. Not only were the predecessors like this, but also the people who are respected or disdained by people in various countries today will never be without the words "perseverance" in their success.</p>
<p>In short, perseverance is the ladder to success. If you lack this kind of perseverance, then success will never be achieved, and instead you will always be trapped in an atmosphere of real failure. Here, we can further realize that the famous teachings that failure is the mother of success and that where there is a will, there is a way are not just boring slogans, but contain considerable value.</p>

<p>into the slipknot, and the more fiercely they jump, the tighter the rope on their feet becomes. In the end, they stand motionless, dejectedly waiting for the elephant hunters to come and deal with them.</p>
<p>The elephant hunters do not meet the wild elephants within three days after they are caught, and they do not give them food. After about a week, the elephant hunters bring food and stand at a distance, throwing it towards them, but this time they are no longer afraid of them seeing it. After three months, the wild elephants gradually become docile, so the ropes on their feet are untied and they are taken home to be kept as domestic animals.</p>
<p>The second method of catching elephants can be used anytime and anywhere. Although the cost is higher than the first method, the effect is much greater than the former. When using this method to catch elephants, it is necessary to look for traces of elephants everywhere in advance. If a group of wild elephants gather together, they quickly tie a long rope around the neck of the domestic elephant they are raising and drive it into the wild elephant herd to move around. The elephant hunters hide far away. After the domestic elephant has become familiar with the wild elephant herd, they slowly pull one end of the long rope towards themselves. The domestic elephant naturally walks in the direction of the rope. At the same time, the group of wild elephants also follows.</p>
<p>The road where this group of elephants is walking is sprinkled with fruits and other food everywhere. So the group of wild elephants unknowingly only cares about eating the food on the ground and walks leisurely. At this time, the elephant hunters lead the trained domestic elephant into a field surrounded by wooden fences. The wild elephants also follow it in a daze. Then, the elephant hunters use a very quick method to close the wooden fence door, so that the wild elephants that have entered can no longer retreat. Then, also according to the above method, the group of wild elephants is starved for a week before food is thrown to them from afar. After three or four months, this group of wild elephants becomes domestic elephants.</p>
<p>But in Africa, it is very difficult to catch elephants alive, because African elephants are very fierce, and it is indeed not easy to tame them, so African elephant hunters often shoot and kill them when they see them, and then come to take their teeth.</p>
<p>However, although there are many elephants in Africa, it is not easy to breed them. If they are shot and killed every day, there may be a day when they become extinct. Even the African wax people who live by hunting elephants have now thought of this, so everyone has agreed on a rule, the general idea of which is: "Each person cannot hunt more than three elephants a year. Female elephants must not be shot."</p>
<p>The method of shooting elephants with guns used by Africans seems to be easier than catching elephants in India, and it does not require much cost. However, because the elephants are different in nature, capturing dead elephants in Africa is more difficult than capturing live elephants in India. African elephant hunters gather a large group of people in advance, all carrying hunting guns, and wait in the dense forest. They first ask a few experienced hunters to survey the tracks of elephants in various forests. When he finds the elephant in what place, he immediately runs back to inform them. This kind of hunter is very respected by the general elephant hunters in Africa, and he gets particularly more private benefits after the elephant is caught.</p>
<p>The large group of elephant hunters receives the notification and immediately sets off with the hunter who reported the news, armed with guns and ammunition. When they are about to approach the place where the elephant is located, everyone does not dare to make a sound and squats down together. Because the elephant's sense of smell and hearing are very keen, as long as it hears a slightly different sound, it will immediately run away alertly. By the time the elephant hunters come to chase it, it will have long disappeared. So a team of elephant hunters has a leader who directs everything in the middle. The position of the elephant hunters and the way they shoot must be directed by the leader. When shooting begins, everyone stands together and aims at the common target from a distance. At the command of the leader, everyone fires their guns at the same time. After the elephant is hit by a large number of bullets, it will not be able to support itself and will fall down. If individual shooting in a skirmish line style is used, it is very dangerous. Because the physique of an elephant can never be subdued by the power of one or two bullets. If it is hit by a shot and does not die, it will immediately rush to the place where the shooting is taking place. If someone is seen by it at this time, his life will be over. No matter where you escape to, it will never fall down until it chases you. Elephant hunting requires a large group of people to go together to avoid this danger. Because there are many people, shooting together, the firepower is fierce. Even if people are seen by it, it has no way to chase them because there are too many people.</p>
<p>In Africa, in addition to the local natives, there are also many white people who engage in this kind of adventurous life from time to time. The value of ivory is not very high in Africa, but once it is transported to the United States and Europe, the difference is several times as much. Therefore, for the sake of high profits, white people do not hesitate to send their lives to Africa to gamble with elephants. White people come here to hunt elephants, mostly in teams of three or five. When they get close to the elephant-producing area, they hire local natives to help them catch them, agreeing on a reward of how much money per day. However, if the hired natives lose their lives due to elephant hunting, the white people are not responsible.</p>
<p>The main purpose of white people coming here is ivory. They often spend several months or even a whole year without starting to hunt elephants, but only specialize in looking for places where dead elephants are found. If that kind of place is found, the ivory they get is more than the ivory teeth shot down in a year. After all, white people are smart. This situation can probably be seen often in foreign animal films that are screened in China.</p>

<p>The pedestrians on the road seemed even more active. He, I, and Ping, Xiu, jumped onto a Route 1 tram, which was even more crowded. We got off and stepped onto the stone steps of the Bank of China, dropping a few silver dollars into a hole in exchange for three admission tickets.</p>
<p>"Ah, this is a moment of pride for the great nation of our ancient civilization! Even the yellow-haired, green-eyed devils have to come and see the civilization of our ancient Eastern country, you fake connoisseurs!"</p>
<p>"Heh heh heh!"</p>
<p>This was a conversation between a fellow with a walrus mustache and a young man in a sharp suit. The young man chuckled and strode in, tap-tap-tap.</p>
<p>First Room – Exhibiting the "Throne" once sat upon by our ancestors, the rulers.</p>
<p>"Truly extraordinary. Ping, what do you think? You have a good eye. Look, a purple dais inlaid with cloisonné cloud-pattern throne, wow, a gilded wooden footrest. The gold isn't yellow enough, is it? What do you say?"</p>
<p>Ping and Xiu silently squeezed through the crowd. The walrus mustache grumbled again: "I don't believe that sitting on the Emperor's throne will really make you dizzy? Damn it, if there weren't chains holding it down, I would definitely sit on it, damn it."</p>
<p>"Ha ha, are you still dreaming of being an emperor?" said the young man in the suit. But the walrus mustache still harbored a wistful feeling of being so close yet so far away.</p>
<p>"Screen – That is a sandalwood screen inlaid with cloisonné immortal mountains and pavilions. Oh, oh." The ancient, thread-bound catalog rustled in dry, claw-like fingers.</p>
<p>"Liu Yong, Weng Fanggang, these few famous Qing Dynasty favorites!" Another middle-aged man with gold-rimmed glasses perched on his nose pushed them up and bent down, touching his nose to the edge of the redwood painting table. "Yes, it can't escape Weng Fanggang's brush." Dry, claw-like fingers stroked the edge of the table again, shell, shell, shell – then tapped on the surface.</p>
<p>Small writing brushes, white jade brush holders, white jade inkstones, white jade seals, white jade brush rests, white jade melon-shaped water containers, everything was made of white jade.</p>
<p>Where did we wander into? Oh, right, the calligraphy and painting room of the Tang, Song, Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties.</p>
<p>"Open the catalog, Ping. This is the calligraphy and painting room. Check the calligraphy and painting catalog, what number? Okay, this one." I narrowed my eyes, staring and staring, then walked further away to look again. Good, very good indeed.</p>
<p>"Maple trees stand aloof - the mountain is even clearer - a long beach with shallow rapids - intersecting horizontally. Two old men - sit peacefully with nothing on their minds, quietly watching the reeds - grow on the other shore. The poetic imagery is also unrestrained and fresh, good poem!" Ping praised.</p>
<p>"Damn it, what the emperor did was too much. Not to mention how many innocent lives were lost at his hands, how much people's blood and sweat he sucked into his belly. Look, just one good, complete piece of art, and as soon as it gets into his hands, he stamps that 'Seal of Imperial Inspection by Qianlong' on it, like a big block of tofu, spoiling the color so much! Look, this red block on top of the mountain peak is so discordant!" Xiu sighed greatly, and everyone's face lengthened.</p>
<p>A great piece of art, I couldn't stand there and feast on its beauty alone, the tide of people rushed me past.</p>
<p>"This painting by the Manchus is not bad! – Hazy mists at sunset, I'll copy it down, this inscription is not bad either; Autumn grass and yellow flowers – covering old paths, hidden forest – where – does smoke rise, a mountain monk alone grows old in the mountains, only seeing – cold pines – see youth! The wonder lies in the last two lines! Chinese painting is like this, the writing must rely on the beauty of the words to complement its beauty!"</p>
<p>We sat down and started chatting:</p>
<p>"Su Hanchen's 'Autumn Garden Children at Play,' Liu Songnian's 'Five Scholars,' I don't know what's so good about them. What's so good about Tang Bohu's apricot blossoms? Heaven knows!"</p>
<p>"On the other hand, several paintings depicting scenes in a rainstorm are all good, tense and meticulous. I like those the most: Li Di's 'Returning Cattle in Wind and Rain,' Gao Kegong's 'Rainy Mountain,' and Lin Tinggui's 'Misty Rain,' Dai Jin's 'Returning Boat in Wind and Rain.' Maybe it's my prejudice, but it seems that this description of the agitated state in a rainstorm is enough to reflect today's era. If those elegant and leisurely things are displayed in this turbulent world again, they seem too far removed from the times."</p>
<p>"That's part of the reason. In fact, there are also some small pieces of leisure and sadness that are more exquisite than the large pieces. Don't you remember? Last year we saw that withered tree painted by Ni Zan at the Ningbo hometown association. It was so light and vigorous. But this time, Ni Zan's things are simply not good."</p>
<p>"Small pieces? Xu Wei's pomegranates are still quite lovely. His inscription is good: Deep in the mountains, ripe stones crack open, smiling towards the sun, few people pick them, relying on bright pearls to walk. Writing about ripe pomegranates, it can be said to be very lifelike."</p>
<p>"What do you think of Emperor Uncle's ink Zhong Kui?"</p>
<p>"Haha, that wisp of beard is really seemingly stable and seemingly present, seemingly existing and seemingly not, but the brushwork seems still vigorous."</p>
<p>The wave-like crowd was rolling in front of us, and we also "went up another floor." Stepping on the marble steps, thinking about the colorful antiques, I unconsciously forgot my original face before entering the ivory tower.</p>
<p>The top floor was just as crowded with people. I caught a glimpse of Mr. So-and-so, one of the giants of the Cunwen Association. He was lifting his long beard, holding his old reading glasses in his palm, rubbing his inflexible eyes, "Flat, flat, oblique, oblique, oblique, flat, flat, oblique, oblique, flat, flat, oblique…"</p>
<p>Emperor Uncle's masterpieces are always the easiest to attract attention. That girl hanging on the arm of a young gentleman like a clerk, while showing her iron fingers to the young gentleman, was putting her little finger in her little mouth, so charming. —</p>
<p>——Garments and hats in dreams, what auspiciousness? The Ming Dynasty has a long heritage. Who compares him to the previous incarnation of Han Yu, writing articles for him with the writing brush.</p>
<p>This is imperial calligraphy. Awkward handwriting, but it is imperial calligraphy, so it also represents Chinese art. Again, the Emperor's imperial calligraphy:</p>
<p>——A branch of residual snow shines on the mountain city, the spring spirit is originally not renewed later, ashamed to use red face to flatter children, plum brother knows my cold years affection.</p>
<p>Emperor Uncle is also a human being, definitely not cold-blooded. Right! Then why do you show such a cold and frosty face to the people?</p>
<p>There were too few "words." Squeezing into a corner, I saw two album pages of calligraphy by Huang Tingjian displayed in a glass case that satisfied me. The writing was transcendent and refined, and the brushwork was concise and meticulous, even more proud than the nearby Su Shi's.</p>
<p>Walking back, I saw two portraits. A certain emperor of the Yuan Dynasty and two empresses of the Yuan Dynasty. Strange, the empress's eyebrows were painted as thin and long as the girls who visited the art exhibition in the 24th year of the Republic of China, but the empress who grew up in the desert of flying sand and cracked skin was not very fashionable after all. A straight black line is really not as beautiful as a curve.</p>
<p>Following the crowd, we poured into another room with displays.</p>
<p>Many heads were bowed over the glass cases, squatting down to see what was below. Pointing and gesturing, laughing.</p>
<p>"Old brother, if you and I had such a thing, we wouldn't have to be worried all day long!"</p>
<p>That "thing" was wearing a melon-skin cap, looking like a small merchant. The person being called "old brother" couldn't stop laughing, and pressed his face even closer to the glass cabinet.</p>
<p>Looking over, there were too many names to remember clearly! What a "li," a "ding," a "lan," a "zuan," a "dou," a "fu," a "hu," a "you," and then what corners, jue, ..., gu, zhi, zun, pan, jian, yi, zhong, bo, zheng, nao, ling, duo, ge, mao, sword – just the categories of bronze ware alone were so many, and each name had so many strange and varied forms. Okay, let's take a quick look and broaden our horizons.</p>
<p>"Haha, Father Xin Li, Island-patterned Fang Li, are they all Shang Dynasty artifacts? Such a distant age!"</p>
<p>"What kind of ding is this? Oh, oh, let me see, yes, Taotie Ding, look how big it is!"</p>
<p>This old gentleman actually went to touch it with his withered hand, touching the glass.</p>
<p>"Country bumpkin! Old fool!" This voice came from who knows where, softly.</p>
<p>"Hahaha." It rang out. The old gentleman widened his eyes and looked around.</p>
<p>The inscriptions on the dark brown bronze ware, although not clear, were very clear on the white paper rubbings. The calligraphy was extremely beautiful. This is probably what is called the inscription on the mirror ding.</p>
<p>"It's a pity that Mr. Bao Lu didn't come with us today, otherwise he could definitely point out a lot to us, right?" Ping said, seemingly very regrettable!</p>
<p>"Yes, we are all laymen, but these words can probably only be recognized by Bao Lu!" Xiu said.</p>
<p>"Not necessarily, maybe he still can't fully recognize them. Many archaeologists can't recognize them!"</p>
<p>"Then, he is much more knowledgeable than us!" I said.</p>
<p>Talking like this, we had already walked past several counters displaying porcelain and jade. These were all things that the rulers had searched for from their slaves and obedient people by virtue of their authority. Thinking of the emperors who, at that time, gathered the whole world to themselves, their luxurious and dissolute lives, and their wanton attitude of taking and seizing, I couldn't help but feel sad. However, the throne finally fell, and the treasures in the Forbidden City were finally displayed in front of the descendants of those who had been suppressed under authority. Isn't this the greatness of the era?</p>

<h3 id="e235">On the Attitude of Reading <a href="#e235" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c235" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">235</a></h3>
<p>— Xue</p>
<p>Mr. Yang Weiyu recently published an article in the special issue of "Reading Problems" in the 25th volume, number 3, of the "Education Magazine," advocating "reading for the sake of reading." The general idea of the original text is: "…Nowadays, most people read with a purpose. If we analyze it, some read for the sake of awakening the world and helping the people, some for the sake of fame and wealth, some for the sake of application, some for the sake of self-cultivation, some for the sake of appreciation, and some for the sake of studies. On the surface, it seems that there are sufficient reasons, but in a nutshell, their reading is all 'for something.' I believe that reading 'for something' is not true reading. It is using reading as a tool, as a means to achieve a certain purpose. It is like students studying for a graduation certificate, and writers writing books for copyright. Of course, there are exceptions, but at least some people put down the tools after the purpose is achieved. Such reading, at most, increases some information in terms of knowledge, and is far from the true meaning of reading. Those who lead learning learn for the sake of learning, and true readers should also read for the sake of reading, that is, reading 'for nothing.'…" Mr. Yang's attitude in this article is that of a "reading supremist." He advocates "true readers reading for the sake of reading," and advocates "reading for nothing." He opposes reading with a purpose, and denies reading "for application," "for self-cultivation," and "for appreciation."</p>
<p>Previously, we knew that Mr. Yang was a vocational educator. Vocational educators have always been proponents of utilitarian education. They have criticized the separation of education and life, and have vigorously advocated education for livelihood, education that combines manual and mental labor, and education in practical skills such as industry, agriculture, and commerce. But judging from this article, Mr. Yang's thinking seems to be very different from before.</p>
<p>In ancient China, apart from those who were obsessed with fame and fortune, there were indeed a few scholars who read for the sake of reading. They regarded reading as the best way to spend leisure time, and regarded the qin, chess, calligraphy, and painting as entertainment. As the saying goes, "There are golden houses in books, and there are beauties like jade in books." They absolutely isolated themselves from the world, absolutely isolated themselves from the times, living comfortably and leisurely, enjoying a life of luxury, and regarding the profit-making activities of all farmers, workers, and merchants as lowly. Most of the ancient readers who "read for the sake of reading" were like this. Because the scholar-official class who read for the sake of reading lived in an environment of leisure, abundance, and food, they had the blessings of their ancestors to enjoy, and had a special situation where they did not have to fight with real life. They did not need a skill to receive a good life, so their reading was completely individualistic, and never had the slightest connection with society and the masses. Perhaps they made some discoveries in the ivory tower, but these discoveries did not contribute to history or mankind!</p>
<p>Today, I dare say that it is definitely not that era. Today's youth, especially the youth of that class, is not. Today's youth must read to improve their living skills, and must read to strengthen the development of their body and mind. Reading and painting must be integrated with real life to be interesting and effective. Those who read for the sake of reading only see mirages in the sky, and can only let the blessed young masters appreciate and praise them.</p>
<p>Most of the young people who have already entered society are mostly regretting that the books they read in school cannot be applied to practical use and are too far away from the world of life. This is because they did not read for the sake of life at that time.</p>
<p>When a person studies at school, he should enrich his knowledge in line with his life goals. Even those who serve in society still have to work hard to study for the sake of improving their business, and will never "put down the tools after the purpose is achieved" as Mr. Yang said. Moreover, their reading will never only be for the sake of reading, and the interest in reading does not necessarily have to be increased by "reading for the sake of reading." Only reading for the sake of solving business difficulties may be more intense than the empty "there are golden houses in books" style of reading because of a sense of "need."</p>
<p>The meaning of "interest lies in the source of needs" that I mentioned above has the best evidence. To give a simple example, the teaching methods in elementary schools used to be injection-style lectures, and the children's responsiveness was very weak, even feeling only pain and not interest. Now, the heuristic method that is advocated uses a kind of motivation to make children feel a certain need and learn, and their interest is naturally much stronger. Also, educational psychologist Peterson once conducted an experiment in which he wrote a lot of words on the blackboard and told the students to copy them. Afterwards, he told them to recite them silently, and after a while, he told them to recite them silently again. This was the first experiment. Another type of experiment was to notify the students in advance that they would copy it once, and then recite it later, and then do it again according to the first method. As a result, the second experiment was much better than the first. It can be seen that the first experiment did not know the need and was copying for the sake of copying, so the results were poor. The second knew the need and was copying for the need, so the results were good.</p>
<p>The reading concept of "studying for a graduation diploma" is indeed wrong, and the reading concept of "reading for fame and fortune" is indeed wrong, but if you say that reading for the sake of application or self-cultivation is not right, then that is really wrong!</p>
<p>Celebrity Biography</p>
<h3 id="e236">The Pure Poet Shelley (3) <a href="#e236" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c236" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">236</a></h3>
<p>— Written by Japanese Tsurumi Yusuke, Translated by Zhou Leshan and Qi Junfu</p>
<p>At this time, his sisters in the girls' school dormitory secretly gave him their own pocket money, so Shelley was spared from starving to death in London.</p>
<p>He often went to the school to see his sisters. On the days when Shelley, who resembled the god Apollo, visited, there was a great commotion in the girls' school. As usual, he wore loose blond hair, wore a throat-revealing shirt, and his coat pockets were filled with biscuits and raisins, bulging outwards. He visited his sisters like a spring breeze.</p>
<p>Then he would tell the female students about his school of justice and beauty.</p>
<p>Among them was a beautiful girl named Harriet Westbrook. Her father was the owner of a hotel, a nouveau riche. This girl secretly loved Shelley. But Shelley, who was as innocent as a young boy, did not notice this.</p>
<p>His uncle was a retired naval colonel with a forthright personality. Through the mediation of this uncle, his father</p>
<h2>Page 24</h2>
<h2>Page 25</h2>
<p>was willing to give him two thousand pounds a year, so he could bury himself in London and read the books he loved.</p>
<p>The following summer, he received a passionate letter from Hai Li. In the letter, she said that everyone in the school laughed at her for being a hotel girl, so she no longer wanted to live in the dormitory. But her father wanted her to return to school no matter what. She felt that life was boring and that it would be better to commit suicide and be done with it. Finally, she said that Shelley should take her away with him. Shelley panicked and went down the mountain to visit her in London. In many ways, Shelley's thinking was different from ordinary people. He did not have the youthful sexual attraction to women, and he did not love Hai Li. However, the sixteen-year-old girl's kind love, after being revealed, made him, who was not concerned with his own interests, feel that he had to save her no matter what. Originally, it would be a great loss to society for a descendant of the nobility to marry a hotel girl, and there were countless women who admired him, but the extraordinarily pure-hearted he was determined to devote himself to this girl's ardent love.</p>
<p>So a nineteen-year-old youth and a sixteen-year-old girl eloped to Scotland and got married on Edinburgh Street. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e242">The Process of Filming the Newsreel of the Hauptmann Kidnapping Trial (Part 1) <a href="#e242" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c242" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">242</a></h3>
<p>— Xin Ni</p>
<p>At the beginning of this year, the biggest news in the United States was the trial of Hauptmann, the kidnapper who kidnapped and murdered the young son of Colonel Lindbergh, the hero who first successfully flew across the Atlantic. Hauptmann was originally from Germany and had lived in the United States for many years, working as a carpenter. Somehow, he came up with the idea of kidnapping the beloved son of Colonel Lindbergh, the hero whom the American people unanimously admired for his successful first flight across the Atlantic. Later, because the search in various places was very urgent and he could not hide, he killed the child and abandoned the body in the wilderness. After the case was solved, after many trials, he was finally sentenced to death.</p>
<p>The Hauptmann case was tried in a local court in Flemington, New Jersey. This was a sensational trial in the United States. During the trial, the major American news agencies telegraphed the situation in the courtroom to countries around the world every day. Our Chinese newspapers also published reports on this case every day. In this way, the American newsreel companies certainly did not want to let it go.</p>
<p>We can now describe and discuss two questions about the filming of the Hauptmann kidnapping case. One is whether there were any illegal aspects in the process of filming the Hauptmann case. The second question is whether the newsreel of the Hauptmann case should have been filmed. These two questions are of great value for discussion in the production of newsreels, and they are worthy of attention by those involved in the production of newsreels.</p>
<p>Regarding the first point, some people at the time raised the question of whether it was illegal or not, and Prosecutor General Wilentz also stated that if the photographers disobeyed orders, the court would file a contempt of court lawsuit against the film company. Some people say that the production of such newsreels was originally illegal and could not be openly filmed, and that the Hauptmann case newsreels currently being screened by various film companies were filmed illegally and secretly. In short, they used tricks, secrecy, and breach of trust to achieve considerable results.</p>
<p>What is the real situation? Of course, only those who personally filmed the film on the scene know. So someone took this question and asked Clifford, the person in charge of filming the Hauptmann case for Universal Newsreel, who told the situation at the time without hesitation.</p>
<p>He said, "There was no falsehood or deception involved." He took out a photo from the courtroom and pointed it out to the interviewer. "That is the camera that filmed the Hauptmann case newsreel. Standing next to it is cameraman Dan Oliver. That is the camera's mobile box, four feet square and two feet thick. Of course, these things cannot be hidden."</p>
<p>In this way, we can know that the newsreel of the Hauptmann case was not filmed illegally and secretly, but how was the sound recorded? According to the "Hollywood" reporter Virgil, the recording machine was hidden under the judge's table, but that is also inaccurate.</p>
<p>Clifford specially invited recording engineer George Graham to describe the content of the recording at the time, because he was the technician who recorded on the spot.</p>
<p>George Graham said: "That's a joke, impossible. People who say this don't know the principles of recording. If the recording machine was placed under the judge's table, all that could be recorded would be a muffled buzzing sound. The noise of the entire courtroom would be recorded in a chaotic manner. But what we recorded was a very clear speech."</p>
<p>According to George's statement, their recording machine was installed on the wall, where everyone could see it. Behind the recording machine, there was also a semicircular cardboard that could be rotated to directly face the place where the sound was coming from. One day, a court clerk deliberately tore off the cardboard. Later, George spent two dollars to have another court clerk reinstall it. Of course, there was no secret involved.</p>
<p>Clifford also said: "Before the Hauptmann case trial began, five major companies held a meeting to discuss the cooperation plan." He took out a piece of paper from the drawer and said, "This is the contract we all signed. We have three large cameras, one installed in the courtroom, one in the courtroom library, and one on the front balcony of the courthouse. These three things are visible to everyone, and the recording machine's wires are a foot thick, which is also very eye-catching, with no concealment whatsoever.</p>
<p>"Furthermore, it has been published in newspapers that when the first night court session was held, the lights in the court suddenly went out completely. Do you know how it happened? It turned out that the 'photo floodlights' used for filming in the court caused the power to be too strong, and the main power line was blown. Later, the floodlights were not used, and 300-watt light bulbs were used instead, so there was no second incident. Of course, everyone in the courtroom knew that someone was filming."

<h3 id="e243">Review of "Clive of India" <a href="#e243" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c243" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">243</a></h3>
<p>— You Jing</p>
<p>Clive of India</p>
<p>Speaking of Robert Clive, the hero who conquered India.</p>
<p>We really need to briefly touch on the "History of the Fall of India." Ever since Diaz and Vasco da Gama and Columbus discovered America-like discoveries of India, the Portuguese fleet was the first to arrive, and then the Dutch, French, and British followed suit, establishing the East India Company and engaging in aggressive competition on this incredibly rich peninsula. Due to the determination of the subjective conditions of each country, only France became Britain's last strong enemy. They first used the Indian indigenous princes to exclude the British, and then directly used troops to seize the British bases. After repeated defeats, the British army was fortunate to have Clive come out to turn defeat into victory and subdue the French, stipulating that India must not station French troops. As a result, the British influence expanded to the whole of India. Subsequently, the King of Bengal, Suraj Ud Dowlah, rose up to wage a war of resistance against aggression, and the British again recalled Clive, who had returned to his homeland, and he used enticement to induce the king's uncle, Mir Jafar, to rebel and win the war. This is the famous Battle of Plassey in 1757 in history. From then on, Bengal became British territory, and East India became the general mechanism for political and economic aggression. The person in charge used Clive's old trick of provoking discord and inducing and threatening the indigenous princes, and by 1857 the whole of India had completely become a colony.</p>
<p>The film "Clive of India" is based on this historical story. In today's world, with the deepening of the economic panic, the fierce competition for sales markets, and at the same time, the rapidly changing situation and the approaching war opportunities, the colonial liberation movement is gradually surging, and the ambitious aggressors dream day and night of obtaining a few more colonial lands to divide in order to solve the international deadlock of political economy that is paralyzed, and at the same time, they also hope for the rebirth of a Clive-style hero to manage and suppress the shaking colonies, so the appearance of this "Clive of India" has become a hunger-relieving product and a stimulant for these dreams and expectations.</p>
<p>"Clive of India" on the one hand is a passionate recollection of the aggressors, a vague yearning, and on the other hand, it is also a demonstration against the self-reliance movement of the weak nations that are being shaken. Therefore, in "Clive of India," we can only see a shadow of the demise of India revealed from the side of the heroic feats, and we can only appreciate the breath of the weak nations from the delicate cries and slight anger of the beauties.</p>
<p>That "Clive of India" has become a film like this is by no means accidental. The playwright distorted the historical significance, erased the objective background, and while emphasizing Clive's personal heroism, he even exaggerated his and his virtuous wife Margaret's tender love, and this attempt was to slightly conceal the intentions we pointed out above. Because of this, the great historical material, which is as brightly colored and bloody as possible, has formed an ordinary war romance film. He spared no effort to depict the hero Clive and to show off the beautiful ladies, virtuous mothers, and good wives like Margaret. The author may think that this is the best of both worlds, but he does not know that he has lost a greater achievement.</p>
<p>The subtitles here seem to be too many. In the production of some historical dramas, the use of subtitles is originally a last resort, but here the playwright is overly biased towards the protagonist Clive himself and uses too many subtitles to replace some pictures. Writing about Clive's initial ambition and writing about Margaret's really rushing over after receiving a love letter from a stranger, these important personality characteristics have not been properly and fully dealt with.</p>
<p>Director Richard Boleslawski's technique is commendable. He wrote about the Clive couple in detail without being tiresome, and he wrote about the surroundings in a lively manner without being simple. The bird's-eye view of the besieged British soldiers and the bird's-eye view of the licentious music in the Indian palace show great power. It's just that the big scene in the House of Commons seems dull and sluggish.</p>
<p>In terms of acting, I have to recommend Loretta Young's expression in the scene where Margaret first meets Clive. Judging from the whole play, her acting as a naive and enthusiastic girl is better than acting as a sophisticated and rational young woman. Colman's scene when he was being judged in court was a failure. The makeup of Edmund, the brother-in-law, is too careless. The hairstyles of the sisters have aged several times, so why is he still so young and has not added any wrinkles?</p>
<h3 id="e244">New Developments in Science and Art - Performances of Color Stereoscopic Films <a href="#e244" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c244" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">244</a></h3>
<p>— Zhi</p>
<p>In recent years, the perfect success and progress of film science and art have undeniably given film audiences a deep understanding and appreciation. Recently, in the progress of film art, there has been a new discovery that has attracted great attention from the world. This is the success of color stereoscopic films.</p>
<p>Since the history of film in the nineteenth century, the creation of color films has gone through several periods of gradual progress. Until now, after years of experimentation, this perfect color stereoscopic film has finally been successful, and the completely natural color "Dancing Partner" has now met us.</p>
<p>For the past twenty-five years, countless methods have been tried for the production of color films. However, the results obtained have never been fully satisfactory. Although the colors of ordinary color positives and cartoons, from the audience's point of view, are mostly already considered to be bright and pleasing to the eye. However, strictly speaking from a technical point of view, these colors have not yet reached the pinnacle of success.</p>
<p>The current method of color stereoscopic film is based on the three-color method. The difference between the three-color system is that the former uses two sets of negatives to print on one film. But now, when shooting a film, three sets of negatives are used to shoot the same target at the same time. The basic colors used are one set of red, one set of yellow, and one set of blue. Because three different positions of lenses are used to capture and print into one film, the same thing is projected. Thus, a stereoscopic image is formed.</p>
<p>A few months ago, after RKO's producer, Merlin Cooper, considered this method of color film, he knew that color film would definitely increase the audience's emotions and the entertainment value of the film itself. After John H. Whitney, the inventor of color stereoscopic photography, successfully experimented, he collaborated with his cousin, Wendeby, to produce the film. Also, because of the importance of color composition in the film, he retained the world-famous stage designer Robert Edmond Jones to preside over it. Mr. Jones felt infinite interest in this emerging art and wanted to contribute some valuable works to society with his experience in color composition and harmony. Later, "Dancing Partner" was completed, and he has achieved great success. And he received the 1934 award from the World Academy of Sciences and Arts.</p>
<p>Hanna McCowan, the producer of "Little Women," is also the producer of this film. This time, Mrs. Carrie also worked hard to help him with his work. The director is Roy Liggin. The photographer is Leinan Zhihan. He is one of the most famous color film photographers.</p>
<p>Last autumn, the company already had a plan to shoot feature films using color stereoscopic technology. So this "Dancing Partner" is the forerunner of future color stereoscopic feature films. The heroine is Ms. Steve Dona, the Hungarian girl who starred in "Flower of the Isle." The hero is Don Alvarez, who is famous for his Spanish dance. The other supporting roles are also the best choices in Hollywood.</p>
<h3 id="e245">Tong Yuejuan Sacrifices Golden Teeth <a href="#e245" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c245" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">245</a></h3>
<p>Tong Yuejuan, a good girl on the red felt couch, previously played a singing girl in the sound film "Red Sheep Hero Biography" by Xinhua Film Company. With a green scarf covering her head and wearing old cloth clothes, she washed away the powder and the fragrance of silk that she usually had. Director Yang Xiaozhong believed that the charm of her expression and the truth of her performance showed that she was a very promising talent. This time, when filming "The Peach Blossom Fan," director Ouyang Yuqian also thought that it was most appropriate for Tong to play the protagonist Xie Sufang in the play. Tong was very interested in the work of the silver screen and readily agreed. However, Tong's pearly teeth were inlaid with gold, and she was deeply afraid that this dazzling thing would enter the lens and turn black, like it was about to fall out. So she resolutely removed the golden teeth, and the filming will begin in the next few days.</p>
<h3 id="e246">Recent News from Shanghai Sound Film Company <a href="#e246" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c246" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">246</a></h3>
<p>Shanghai Sound Film Company has been working very hard recently to film "Peach Blossom Dream." This play was written by Zheng Yimei, directed by Du Yu, and starred Yin Mingzhu. Although Yin has starred in many films, it is still the first time for her to speak in a sound film.</p>
<p>"Peach Blossom Dream" contains the "Song of the World of Money," written by Li Jinhui, which is extremely satirical.</p>
<p>Cang Yinqiu, Ying Yin, Zhou Fengwen, Dan Pinpin, etc. all play important roles in "Peach Blossom Dream."</p>
<p>Overthrowing women's vanity and exposing the evils of society are the sole purposes of "Peach Blossom Dream." Therefore, it was praised by the Film Censorship Committee during the initial review.</p>

<p>— Ti Yun</p>
<p>Thorne's eyes were closed, but his fingers groped for Amy's hand, holding it tightly. He gasped slightly and said, "Amy... marry Walt... he is a good guy... Walt..." Amy almost cried when she heard this, but she managed to hold back and said, "I want to marry you... marry you again... as long as you want me... Thorne, my love..."</p>
<p>Thorne wanted to laugh, but at this moment, a sharp pain suddenly invaded his heart. Amy turned her head to the side, unable to bear to look any further. Thorne's voice was even weaker, but he still said intermittently: "Want to call me... speech... topic... death... death is stupidly painted... how to deal with it... not bad... I..." His voice gradually disappeared into the void. His eyes were still closed, but one of his hands loosened and fell down.</p>
<p>Amy was still kneeling beside him. She knew that everything was in the past. There was nothing in the world that she could care about anymore. But she knelt there without moving, until Walt quietly walked up to her and gently helped her up.</p>
<p>Thorne died in the summer. But the summer quietly passed, autumn scraped the leaves off the trees, and winter came again, covering the earth with a layer of white velvet. During these difficult years, Walt stood by her side forever, helping her and caring for her with the warmth of friendship, never leaving her.</p>
<p>It was another snowy afternoon, and Walt and Amy sat silently on a park bench. Amy's eyes were fixed on the cars coming and going, unconsciously fascinated by them. Walt stood aside, quietly looked at her for a while, and then said, "Amy, we should go. It could rain at any time in this kind of weather." Amy said, "I like the rain..."</p>
<p>Everyone was silent for a while, and Walt couldn't help but call out to her, "Amy..." Amy said, "Yes, my love?" Walt stammered, "Think about it, I think it's best to... forget him... don't think about him." Amy slowly raised her head, looked at Walt's face, and put both hands in his hands. She said, "But, Walt, I have forgotten... everything about him, I have forgotten... everything! Look, I decided to forget... and I really forgot!"</p>
<p>Walt patted her hand, and they looked at each other in silence, but understood each other's hearts. They stood up and slowly walked out of the garden. Walt called a streetcar. Amy tightly hugged Walt's arm. Walt would never disappoint her. He would put peace in her heart... he could give her a guarantee. That's right, she had indeed forgotten Thorne.</p>
<p>As she walked, she muttered to herself: "Forgetfulness, Walt, that's what an Indian chief taught me... he lives in the Black Hills of Dakota... I'm very friendly with him... before he died, he taught me that secret..."</p>
<p>A streetcar stopped by the road. Walt helped Amy into the car, and then jumped in himself. It was the dim yellow dusk, and the car soon disappeared into the white snow. (The End)</p>
