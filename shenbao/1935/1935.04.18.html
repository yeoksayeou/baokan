<p>— 彥</p>
<p>華商捲烟工業。自捲烟統稅改課二級稅以來。因稅率恭重。加以內地農村破產。購買力减縮。乃不得不於同業間從事競爭。一面極力减低售價。以廣招徠。一面更以鉅額獎金及贈品附入。（卽所謂贈品烟。）以誘致顧客。其所以不惜作孤注之一擲。無非爲自謀生存。奮全力以圖掙扎耳。乃自此種「贈品烟」流行之後。國烟銷路果見激增。然以銷額而論。去年全年產銷仍僅四十餘萬箱。僅及往年之二分之一。因此。多數廠商。均以利潤微薄。暗虧甚巨。其能獲稍佳之營業紀錄者則屈指可數。</p>
<p>乃者。自今年三月起。「贈品烟」之出廠已遭禁止。更自下月爲始。此項「贈品烟」亦不准銷售。令行迄今。國烟銷路低落。價格慘跌。同時英美烟。公司之捲烟乃乘機傾銷。考英美烟公司之出品。最少時代每月僅一萬餘箱。近數月來。每月增銷約三萬六千餘箱。估計每月銷數。將及五萬箱之巨。其售價更極力减低。藉以競爭。例如小仙女牌。過去每箱售一百六十餘元。現在僅售一百四十二元。且每一空壳。尙可換烟一支。約計換烟項下。又需减十四元。卽每箱實賣一百二十八元。去統稅八十元。尙餘四十八元。再去原料工資。折扣回佣等開銷。實際上恐尙不敷成本。如此競爭。豈我資力薄弱之華商捲烟同業。所易抵擋。</p>
<p>夫英美烟公司之所以不恤巨大犧牲。亟亟出此者。無非自恃其資力之雄厚。謀壓倒華商捲烟工業。以圖永遠獨覇我國市塲耳。故自去年十一月一日起。彼方特將原有英商駐華英美烟公司。英商大英烟公司。及英商和泰烟有限公司。改組爲英商頤中烟草股份有限公司及英商頤中運銷烟草股份有限公司。其改組目的。卽在增加其營業方面之效率。而收產銷分工合作之效。最近大美烟公司之駐華經理權。又爲該公司所取得。是其勢力。將益見膨脹。而國貨捲烟業將更受其嚴重之影響矣。</p>
<p>抑英美烟公司固不僅以其資力之雄厚。以壓迫我國貨廠商。且復以其他手段。予我國貨廠商種種無形之摧殘。所幸國貨廠商。每遇外來之壓迫。輒以保守政策。暫避其鋒。壓迫一旦稍鬆。則又勃焉興起。因此十餘年來。雖受種種困難。少數廠商。仍能勉力支持。然而犧牲於此者。則亦不知凡幾焉。最近吾人復目覩我國捲烟工業陷於困境。難自振拔。良不能不深致感慨。甚望政府當局。體念商艱。與夫扶植我民族工業之重要。一面設法抑制外商不當之競爭。一面予我國貨廠商以相當之援助與便利。俾我國貨捲烟工業之生機不致爲外商對我競爭之種種策略所摧殘盡凈耳。</p>

<p>今日之行政院會議乃日本退出國聯後之第一次、日本一席虛懸兩年、今已移去、蘇俄外委李維諾夫已爲英外相西門之左鄰、法外長賴伐爾提出决議案時聲稱、三月十六日德國擅自實施强迫軍役之行爲必須加以斥責、今必須設法使國聯盟約在集體安全組織中更有實力、行政院受託維持和平、必須盡其責任、法國已以其行動表明願意和平、二月三日在倫敦開始之談判已爲德國之行動所破壞法國之政策非欲讐對一國、法國所要求之安全乃欲普及於各國云、</p>

<p>三、一九三五年三月十六日德國通過之國防法實與此等原則相抵觸、</p>
<p>四、此種片面行動决不能獲得權利、</p>
<p>五、此種片面行動增加國際亂源之新因素定將威脅歐洲之安寗、</p>
<p>六、英法兩國獲得意國之同意、曾自一九三五年二月三日以後、與德國談判謀取全歐之安寗、並根據德國積極參加國聯之原則、謀成立一普遍之裁軍、七、德國之片面行動、不僅與此計劃不符、且適値談判進行之時出之、</p>

<p>一、德國未能遵守條約、實已破壞國際團體之全體所應負之義務、行政院譴責此種片面廢棄國際義務、</p>
<p>二、行政院請起草及簽字於一九三五年二月三日計劃之政府繼續此項業已開始之談判、並就國聯範圍之內、求其成功、並努力成就其保安寗維和</p>

<p>賴伐爾致辭畢、卽由英國外相西門發言、略謂「英國政府與法意兩國政府聯合提出决議草案、希望此項草案、由行政院一致予以通過、至於英法意三國提出此項决議草案之原因、則係根據斯德萊柴會議之最後宣言、依照此項宜言、英法意三國政府决定、遇有單方面廢棄條約義務而足以損害和平時、應採各種方法、以合力對付之、此次提出行政院之决議草案、卽係將英法意三國此項義務、加以推廣、而由各會員國共同參加之、此種决議草案、雖由一國之違約行動而產生、然吾人固可適用於全體國家、以收維持和平之效益、且决議草案內所建議各項、亦絕未閉塞未來談判之門戶」云云、</p>

<p>春秋點滴  （吴吉人）　　嬌豔的桃花，經不起風雨的侵蝕，就要落英滿地，飄零不堪了，愈是美麗的東西，生命愈是短促。　　勤儉——富貴——驕奢——淫逸——窮困——貧賤。這循環的因果律，是顚撲不破的。　　金錢萬能，你要是有錢的話，不論是什麽東西，以要是你意中想象得到的，都可以倖　，什麽呌公理，什麽呌法律，經不起金錢的作祟，都可以翻覆，動搖，世界上金錢勢力及不到的，此刻只剩一個死」字。　　對同儕傲岸，自己視甚高的人，你要曉得「它」就是最會向上司吹拍而最下作的東西。歌船畫舫賽清明  汪放庵　　居鄉日久，淹忽不知歲月，偶翻志乘，於前人塘棲竹枝詞中得有「歌船畫舫賽淸明」之句。因憶嘗聞父老傳言：三十年前，每值淸明，士穀神則必出巡，社廟之首，遂集里中年少，纜舟爲舫，綴以彩樓，敎兒童習粉墨登塲之戲，歌唱其間，蟻於丁山湖心，習爲水嬉，羣相競賽之舉。予生也晚，似此盛事，不獲目覩，祇勞神往。而每讀曲園太史水嬉之曲，尤不禁令人生勝會不常之感也。惟歌船畫舫之賽，別于廟山蠶桑之祝，則至今勿替。廟山位於超山之側，其上有廟翼然，祀五聖神，廟祝多丁姓子弟，倚香火爲生，計淸明節一日間收入之資，足抵一歲贍活，故晏如也。歲值淸明，塘棲之西北以及德淸縣屬各鄉村人民，多以舟往祀祝蠶桑，歌船畫舫港爲之塞。此項設施，輙以兩小舟連繫爲舫，上舖木板，中列屏風，懸以神像，供置三牲及絲繭等祭品，梢尾各置五色旗幟，臨風飄飄。男子羣趨屏前或擊鼓鳴鉦，奏西番樂，或調絲弄竹，以十三四童髫小兒女，效仙家裝束，戴蓮花冠，衣綠色裳，面敷脂粉，手打旛杆爐香，曼聲淺唱花名寶卷，或演武技，踴躍跳盪，肌肉墳然。女子則以錦帕憂首，坐立屏後，任人平視，不少忤。朝山以後，魚貫而歸，每過市河，觀者雲集，船上人亦興緻倍豪，良辰佳節，經此點綴，提別有風味也，惟年來農村破產，歌船畫舫之賽亦漸冷落于淸明時節矣。續談湯鐵  椒公　　本刋前載「椀公」的一則湯鐵，沒有說明湯的名號和籍貫，並現在有沒有湯的作品遺留，讓我來補充一點。　　湯名鵬，號天池，是安徽省當塗縣人。（中國人名大辭典誤作蕪湖人）　　他是當塗黃左田（名鉞嘉慶朝官禮部尙書諡動敏）曾祖的房客，湯的鐵畫成名和神妙，黃的壹齋集，（中國人名大辭典誤作西齋集）記述的很明白。　　黃因錢唐梁同書湯鵬鐵畫歌，不能發揮湯的神妙，又做了一首七古歌（凡三十七句）稱贊湯的絕技。　　並在描寫燕湖風景的「于湖竹枝詞」，加倍地贊美他。　　詞的第十九首：「風捲松濤入夢醒，臥遊曾對赭山亭，分明天水明于練，一幅湯鵬鐵畫屏」。　　湯的作品，本已神妙，又經過梁同書黃左田幾位大老提倡揄揚，聲價格外高貴。當蕪士紳家，皆要懸掛湯鵬鐵畫，見他的風稚，求過於供，價值日昂，仿製百出，眞品難得。宣統年間，南洋勸業會徵集工藝作品，蕪湖方面，曾送去幾件湯鵬鐵畫可惜都是偽作。　　但眞假極容易分辨，湯的作品，是用手搓捻成功的，畫身的鐵片，厚薄不一，隨着畫的形狀，樹莖是圓的，花苞是半開的，魚鱗是一片片的，鳥毛是一絲絲的，湯的鐵畫，沒有一點模糊，一幅畫找不出一根釘子，假陽畫，是拿薄鐵片剪成的，埋在潮濕地裏，等它生了鎊，拿釘子釘起來，祗要畫樣子打的好，也可以欺一欺外行，不過全是平面，沒有皺痕畫意，現在蕪湖當塗一帶，古貨店也常常看見寄賣，冒充古畫，買的人要放出眼光來。商業前綫小西天  張恨水著　　第十二回　慚愧沒衣裳垂惟避客辛勤省膏火佛曉抄書　　月英在帳子裏抖顫着道：你快些來罷，我在這裏睡着，可有些害怕。胡嫂子道：這呌鬼話了。靑天白日，又關了門放了帳子，你還怕些什麼？他說着這話，人向外走，可就把門向外帶着，而且扣起來了。月英生平也沒有睡過這樣和軟的被褥，不到十分鐘之久，週身溫暖過來，於是舉目四觀，這帳子楚怎樣的做成的。在甘肅長了這樣大，一半睡在窰洞子裏。雖有一半，是睡房屋的年月，可是房屋裏面，只有一張土坑。土坑上最普通的點綴，是上面鋪着羊毛氈子，坑下的眼裏，燒着馬糞，終身能有一條棉被蓋着，那已經是上等的享受，帳子這樣東西，雖也聽到人說過，是什麽樣子，却沒有看見過。現在居然也有實用這帳子的一天了。這帳子是好子固然風吹不進來，就是有什麽蟲子，也飛不到臉上，可以安心睡覺。他正這樣的出着神去玩味這帳子的好處，却聽到門外的搭扣，下突一下嚮。心裏也就想着，必是那位程老爺回來了。自己赤着身子，睡在人家被裏，一點遮掩的東西也沒有，若是人家走進來，還是理會人家呢？還是不理會人家呢？當他這樣的想時，門開了，人已經走了進來。隔了蚊帳一看，却是到程志前這裏來補習功課的王北海。（一八五）御香縹緲錄  淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯]　　紙花釘好，再做第三步工作。這第三步工作，是最雞的。因爲伊們不但要把這幾朶梅花繡出來，還得選用顏色深淡不同的各種絲綫，酌量替換着應用，爲求像眞起見，伊們往往先去採幾朵眞的梅花來，放在一邊做樣子；該用深色的，便用深色，該用淺色的便用淺色，待做好了看時，簡直和樹上長着的花，分不出眞假來了！　　無論一朶鮮花上的顏色是怎樣的深淡得宜，伊們總得盡着心力去模倣它，因此伊們在一針針挑繡着的時候，總得時時回頭云端相那朶眞花：差不多每繡一針，必須回頭去看一看：何處是深色，何處是淺色，半些都不能讓它糢糊：因此每一架繡床的橫木上，總有四五十種顏色各別的絲綫掛着，以便隨時取用。其中用途最廣的，自然還是紅綠兩色。　　至于那朵剪就的紙花呢？最先原不過是用來表顯輸廓和决定部位的，但繡了幾針之後，再要將它取出來，手績上旣感麻煩，事實上也沒有這種需要。而且還是讓它留在裏面的好。因爲一朶花有了這張紙片一襯托，繡上去的絲綫，便頓時覺得厚了許多；待到全部繡成了看時，花瓣都從鞋面上凸了出來，彷彿是另外貼上去的眞花一條，這也是中國繡貨的獨到的技巧！（二九五）水老鴉  倪尙龍　　温柔的春風，輕輕地掠過小木橋畔陂岸上的一株傾斜在水面上的垂柳。絲絲的柳條，微微地颭拂着波平如鏡的河面，便皺起了一圈一圈笑渦樣的波紋來。隱潛在橋影裏「接喋」「接喋」（魚吃水之聲）優遊着的無數小魚，被一陣波動，驚如翩鳳似的逃開了。　　從悠悠的姻波渺茫處，箭也似的撐過來三艘扁舟似的放鳥船，船舷上排立着十幾隻比鳥鴉稍大黑羽巨喙頸寬如囊的水老鴉，（鸚鵡）它們的頸間都束縛着一根組綫，使它們食不下咽。放鳥人的裝束，都是一樣的載着翻邊的氈帽，穿伴破棉襖，束條破綫網巾。他們到了離橋不遠，都不約而同的手舉竹竿，足蹲着木板劈拍，劈拍，同時口中也一片亂嚷……合罕……合罕……趕着一羣水老鴉下水，那水老鴉也懂命令似的……甲……甲……和放鳥人的呼聲應和着，慢慢地四散開來，向一片碧波中，穿花蝴蝶似的和魚類去爭鬥。魚類見了便像鼠見貓似的很少能安然逃遁的，大都是給它們生吞活嚥，任意摧殘。　　可憐的它們旣負了水國軍閥的威望，然而終不能把魚類嚥下肚去，每日挨飢忍餓毫無實惠的供人類的驅使。　　現在的人類中也不少負了絕大的威望，嚷着枵腹從公的。倘瞧見這放水老鴉的事，也當自笑不已哩。游踪所至三月三日祖師山  火雪明　　廢暦三月初一二，古稱上已節，從各種史籍上，可以我到帝皇如何流水汎酒，雅人如何曲江修楔，以及婦人們的蠶市祈福等等韻事。而今年，正值陰晴不定的晚春，乍暖還寒的氣候，自家恰恰跟了明德女子中學的遊山小隊，滯留在瀕江的常孰縣裏。打聽得這天祖師山上，有着遠近彙集來的成萬善男信女，要在那裏擠軋整天，熱鬧非凡；好在初二日晚上，己在市前大街，瞧見了赤胸男子滿身懸掛了花燈遊行，和繡衣綵幗的兒童樂隊的『宣卷」，使我酷信？這迷戀於神敎的封建社會裏，一定會表現出更十眞肫更愚蠢的農人情緒來。因此把北平妙高峯朝山進香的印象活躍了一遍，腦中被千爲顆頭顱，瓜似的碾在雲烟裏亂滾。但「祖師山」，土人一律呼喚的名稱，供着那一個祖師呢？爲甚要在三月初三，才傾城而出，全向拂水巖上奔？這問題把自己窘住了，能回答些什麼呢？然而……不管這些，就在那天拂曉，踏着草徑上的宿露，從鎭江門出桃源澗，一步一步向新闢的黃泥闊道上推進，太陽雖已放出，只蒸散微薄的晨曦，在淸新的曉風裏，沒有覺到苦熱。沿路有山村裏的孩子，把楊柳枝剝掉了靑皮，做成Stick，以三五個銅元的代價，出賣給我們，眞帮助了腰脚不少的忙。其間也有提着籃子的江北兒女，老是跟着遊客，鏡賣他們的莞濟。　　石屋澗的亂石流泉，使同行伴侶，歡喜的了不得。伊們是難得在空山寥寂的處所，領略寒瀑松風秋烟危磴。而今由天然的景物，鼓舞起新奇的興味，排成了兩行藍色的行列，手裏執着小白旂和杖，這樣興奮地，一聲不饗地，溜過了維摩寺，連進去啜一盞淸茶的心情都沒有。「大路歌」的激昂的聲音，從松風裏透露了都市小姐的勇氣，給全山正在爬上去的媽蟻一樣的人羣，回過頭來突着眼珠子，帶着懷疑興好奇。看，那有幾千萬隻眼睛喲！　　眞的，每人僂着背脊，背鴃了蒼天，跳着飛着，向迂曲的山徑上前去，眼前爬搔着的是人，由近而遠，一隊又一隊，互相銜接着，像一串堅强的鍊條。走到斗牛棧的山崟，站定脚跟，瞪眼看南天烟霧，所有綠樹黃畦，浮嵐明水，畫被煊染入一幅糢糊的油畫裏，遠處上山來的游人，也羼進了畫幅，城中方塔，浮出一橛塔尖，那還不是活動的影片？嬰是拿劈面的靑山，當做大自然的背景，一條銀白的曲徑迤　伸入雲天，那更像是戈璧中的一段長城的殘堞，依稀有驢車宛轉而遊。再看左面的尙湖，爲了凝霧屯集，白茫茫找不得一點痕跡，蔚成渺無涯涘的雲海。萬一我必需自殺，我應該搜覓這樣精緻的地方，一躍而下。　　雜在燒香隊伍裏，被「大路歌」威脅着，居然瞧見了望海墩上的黑底白點的北斗七星旗，飛在晴風淡日中，有千巴人圍護着在。這樣，立刻使我記憶起禮記上的一句「前朱鳥而後玄武」的句子，古稱玄武北方的神道，在詳符年間，避聖祖諱，改稱眞武帝君，現在祖師山上的藏海寺，正踞虞山最北麓，那末所供的祖師，一定楚眞武無疑。常熟人到這兒來朝謁靈嶽，也許還是拔徐修　的變風？又何怪滿山擁擠着無指可數的游屐！</p>

<p>申報國貨週刊上海市學生國貨年專號全市學生服用國貨願詞　　吾以至誠誓願從本身起，並勸導家庭，勸導全社會，一律用國貨，如有可用之國貨而不用時，願受國人嚴重處罰！　　民國二十四年四月十八日上海市學生國貨年特刊發刊詞  潘公展　　現在我們整個民族所受經濟恐慌的襲擊，雖可說楚創巨痛深，但是一般人對於「國貨」還很少眞確深切的認識。今年上海市各界的領袖所以規定爲「學生國貨年」把提倡國貨的使命交給學生，便是希望一般最可親愛的受敎育而有智識的學生，能够把自己對於國貨的眞確深切的認識，傳播到一般人，使一般人也都能有眞確深切的認識。　　學生們的使命，旣是傳播關於提倡國貨的認識，那學生自身就當然不該沒有認識。因此我不能不和學生諸君，談談這認識國貨的問題。　　第一，須知經濟的關係是最複雜的。巴黎製造的一粒牙粉，會影響到紐約市民的生活，加州生產的一樓棉花。會影響到印度農民的生計。所以各國的國民，都不能沒有經濟的打算，都不能不抵抗經濟的侵略。我們中國人向來是「靠天吃飯」，「聽天由命」的，絕無打算，縱使打算也只是無組織無識的打算。加以國家力量不如人，生產技術不如人，不能用政治力量防止洋貨侵入我們的市塲，不能用優越的生產技術壓倒外國製造品，結果便形成了門戶洞開任人侵略榨取的局面。到得現在，民族的血液已經快被人吸盡了，國民的生活力也已非常微小了，如果我們還不知道建築抵禦經濟侵略的堤防，造成全國普遍服用國貨的風氣，卽我們中國確有亡於經濟侵略的可能。？　　第二，須知現在的世界，有極端矛盾的兩面；一面是天堂，一面是地獄。經濟能力充足的國民升到天堂，經濟能力不充足的國民墜到地獄。拿我們中國人和外國人相比，正是一在天堂，一在地獄。這種絕對矛盾的現象，在上海是特別的顯著。上海特區裏面，外國人的數量雖很少，然而他的財產額却很大，中國人的數量雖很多，然而他的財產額却很小。他們住好的，穿好的，吃好的。而我們却不能不住壤的房屋，穿壞的衣服，吃壤的東西。其所以會形成這種局面，魷是因爲他們的經濟能力比我們的經濟能力大。現在我們如果想逃出地獄，那魷必須先養成我們自己的經濟能力。但經濟能力的養成，却有待於國貨的發展：欲求國貨的發展，又有待於服用國貨心理的形成。所以現在我們的提倡國貨，實是爲幼稚的國民經濟能力做培植的工作，乃是改善我們的生活的必要步驟。　　第三，須知口頭上的民族復興紙面上的經濟繁榮，都無補於事，而應該切切實實的幹。我們中國所以會這樣衰微貧困，就是因爲復興只在口頭，繁榮只在紙面，現在我們如果不忍再把復興掛在口頭，不忍再把繁榮舖在紙面那就要趕緊去做實際的工作。雖實際的工作决不止提倡國貨一端，然提倡國貨畢竟是很緊要的工作。因爲國貨多一個買主，工業便多一綫生計，生產原料的農村，也多一種出息，而其反對方面，是舶來品少却一個買主，外國人少賺了一點金錢。這在我們國民經濟的發展上，决不楚一伴小事。國民經濟有了發展，庶幾復典和繁榮就不會徒托空言了。　　上面的話，雖很簡單，但一般昏昏庸庸的人是連這簡單的認識都不能普遍具備的。因此我很希望上海全市的學生諸君能够於自身切實認識之餘，再從事於開通民智，把這關於提倡國貨服用國貨的認識，普遍地傳播給一般的社會。今天全市學生舉行宣誓服用國貨願詞儀式，我相信可愛的靑年學生，他們對於國貨的熱忱决不僅至於宣誓服用而止的。大家勉勵着吧！學生國貨年中的小學生  復旦高中劉英慧女士　　誰都曉得今年是學生國貨年，從今以後，凡是中國的學生，都要服用中國貨。一方面使金錢不向外國流去，一方面使國內的工人有工做；工廠能穩固。另一方面使出產的東西，慢慢兒改良：對於國家民生都有莫大的利益。　　我們小學生用的東西雖然不多，可是人數很多，要是每人用一件外國貨，總算起來，外溢的金錢着實不少。何况未必只用一伴呢！　　那末我們怎樣實行服用國貨呢？我以爲有五點要做到：　　一，自已要有决心看見了好玩好吃的東西，不是本國貨，隨便怎麽好，决不去買。　　二，貨物要調查淸楚　有許多貨物，國貨已經能做得和外國貨一樣，×人又最喜歡胃中國的牌子，奸商又常常把洋貨改成國貨商標，隨便買來；往往會上當的。　　三，別貪便宜××人最刁滑，只要中國人肯買他們的東西，就是虧本也肯賣的，市上的×貨，總比國貨賤，你要貪便宜，就免不了買××貨。　　四，要勸人家也要受人家勸看見別人，尤其是同學和家長，買洋貨；要是能够很婉轉的去勸告，人家一定會覺悟，而聽你的話。這樣，國貨至少能多銷一件或許能多一個用國貨的人。如果因爲認不淸楚而買洋貨，人家來勸止，應該立刻聽人家的話，絕對不可因爲羞恥而發怒，偏偏去買來。　　五，組織小團體要免上當，要多方調查；不是一個人所能做到，要免去一時的貪心糊塗，必須有監視或勸告，和同學組織小團體，就是解决上面兩種困難的好方法。　　話說得太多了，全國的小朋友，照着我的話去做，我想効力一定很大。如果有更好的方法，也希望發表出來，給我實行。宣誓服用國貨  仰葊　　今天是上海全市學生宣讀服用國貨願詞的日子，全市三十萬的學生，自幼稚生小學生中學生以至大學生，個個高舉着雪白的手來當衆宣誓，於自身服用國貨以外，還要勸家庭，勸親友，勸全社會，並說明知道有國貨可用，而用非國貨的，願受嚴重之處罰，這種又莊嚴，又鄭重的典禮，確爲自有國貨年來的創舉。　　宣誓，本不是輕易舉行的，也不是宣誓以後，便可不負責任的。不宣誓便罷，如果宣誓以後，彷彿是大家各立了一張契約，要始終不忘，到死負責的。諸位學生！今天爲熱血所激發，愛國心所驅使，高高興興的來宣誓服用國貨。那麽，自今以後，好似大家在十目所視十手所指之下，對着社會立了一個服用國貨的契約，有終身履行的義務。不要說有心違犯，便是無心疏忽，也要受良心的責罰，公衆的制裁，爲同學所唾駡的。吾認爲這次宣誓以後，最好的辦法，是同學間彼此的監督，相互的警戒，不徇悄，不瞻顧，不怕遭怨，各人以亦心至誠待人，忠實眞摯對社會，行乎心之所安，爲國家留元氣，爲民族爭人格，都在你們學生身上。諸位學生，美團又在那裏操縱銀價了，乞憐華盛頓政府，哀求洋商銀行，都是沒中用的；只有我純潔高尙的學生界來倡率全社會服用國貨，纔是根本辦法。　　本刋投稿人注意　本日各報所登應徵文字，給獎辦法，由作者擇優互選，再交宣傳委員會審定，詳章在四月二十五日公布。學生國貨年標語　　學生國貨年　學生一律用國貨　　學生國貨年　學校一律用國貨　　學生國貨年　學生家庭一律用　　國貨　　學生國貨年學生勸導全社會一律用國貨　　學生國貨年學生畢業後各就　　所學　提倡製造或推銷國貨　　學生國貨年敎師及敎師家庭一律用國貨　　學生國貨年曾爲學生者一律用國貨　　學生國貨年全國（中）（無論沿江沿海腹地邊疆所有）敎師和學生　一律領導全社會用國貨</p>

<p>自由談左拉與王爾德的選擇  胡洛　　左拉的寫實主義，與王爾德的唯美主義，是代表兩積本質相異的文藝思潮。這兩種不同的思潮，都曾在文學史中，放過異彩。　　關於左拉的寫作態度，他自己說：『我譬如要描寫劇塲的光景，和菜館的狀况時，我爲着要充分地知道這種地方的實狀，便親自實地去觀察。』至於左拉的創作方法，他在『羅貢·瑪加爾小設叢書』的序文上這樣寫：『我在這里，精細地研究遺傳與境遇，科學的地叙述這個產生那個的關係，作爲方法。』所以，左拉是以科學與寫生的方法來創作的，因爲他相信『現世紀的世界，實在是科學的世界。因了這種科學的進步，理想，絕對，不可知這種話，在世間已經絕迹了。』（左拉：實騐小說論）左拉的偉大便在這兒，他不「架空」地描寫，他更不脫離現實，他也應用了『科學的方法。』雖然左拉也有缺點，雖然他並不能深入現實里，去認識現實的本質；但是，左拉畢竟是個忠實的現實描寫去。「他不特以藝術家的資格來涉獵自己所欲描寫的經濟或文化的生活的部門之許多書籍，而且也親身去觀察過那些被描寫入小說中的生活方面。」因此，他寫炭礦夫的生活時，他便實地到法蘭西北部及比利時的礦井下去觀察。他寫「信院長穆萊的罪過」時，他便實地到寺院中去居住。這些地方，都表現了左拉的偉大精神。　　但是，王爾德却是反對左拉的。王爾德曾這樣批評左拉：『從藝術的見地看來，左拉的作品差不多全無價值，只是零分。他作品中的人物，都是頹廢而可憐的人們，罪惡之結晶的人們。這些人物的生涯，是毫無興味的紀錄……左拉的人物，却全是寫生。他的作品毫無價值，就是這個原故。（王爾德：架空的頹發）王爾德便是極端反對寫生的作品，他主張「架空」的描寫。他完全站在個人享樂主義的立塲來寫作。例如他寫「杜速格雷畫像」，他便這樣說：『我，單只爲了我自己的快樂，寫了杜連格雷畫像的。寫迄部小說，實際上給與了我非常的快戚。』（給＂St，James　Gozette”記者的信）王爾德是頂僧恨現實的，他認爲藝術應該超脫現實。因此，他主張「爲藝術而藝術」，「藝術只表現藝術自身，藝術有獨立的生命。」從這個觀點出發，他便走到極端觀念的境地來了。依他的主張，藝術不是人生的鏡子，而人生才是藝術的鏡子。他認爲虛無主義是屠格湼夫造成；不是因爲先有虛無主義，才有巴札羅夫（Bazarev父與子的主角），而是因爲有了巴札羅夫才有虛無主義。王爾德是如此的主觀，是如此的倒果爲因了。因此，個人的肉慾享樂主義，便由這個哲學的觀點產生。當我們讀了「莎樂美與「杜述格雷畫像」時，便可以找出證明來。　　從左拉到王爾德，我覺得左拉更值得學習的。固然，我們也可以從王爾德那兒學點東西，然而，像五爾德那種藝術觀念，鄒種個人的享樂主義，便不是我們所應當學習的。我們要像左拉一樣，要描寫現實的東西。左拉在「實騐小說論」中，曾說過這樣一句極寶貴的話：『我們的任務，在於搜尋社會底罪惡的原因。』是的，我們不但要描寫社會的現象，而且，我們還要深入現象中去　　自然，我們並不無批判地接受左拉的遺產。左拉依然是有錯誤的。他並不能深入現實。「實騐」的創作方法，是不能捉往社會的本質，所以，他也不能眞正地「搜尋社會底罪惡的原因」了。而且，我們也不應該完全否定了王爾德，在某種悄况下，我們還可以接受一部分的王爾德底「浪漫主義」。現實主義與浪漫主義並不是絕對不相容的啊！可是，左拉楚比較更值得寶貴的，因爲他是忠實地反映了現實。至於我們，則不僅要反映現實，還得深入現實，「搜尋社會底罪惡的原因」，而且，還要指出路向來。天真  王瑩　　是春天了。　　太陽斜斜地晒着市街和屋脊，野地裏，一切的花草和柳條，在綠茵中溫柔地笑着了。　　記得，在這樣的季節裏，自己的生命也曾和花草一般地活躍地笑過的；那是，笑得那麽地自然和眞誠，雖然，這笑已是不能再在目前的生活裏留着痕跡了。但，偶而地追懷起來，也會制止不住地惆悵着的。　　能拿什麼來比擬在中學時代的黃金生活呢，那裏是只容許眞誠和天眞，幸福的幻想和光明的追求的；而那時的腦子裏也從不曾想過關於生活一類的事；一直地，跨進了大學，學校的先生們也不曾和我們提起關於生活上的話，那好像永遠都和我們無關似地，假如有一天眞的踏進了這惡魔般的世界時、便會不知所措地張惶起來了。不但沒有餘暇給來打算生活，卽使是吸一口氣，也得要費過無數萬的心力了！　　我們能够部誰，「天眞」在什麽時候便和我們隔絕了的；在什麼時候便拋去了我們連頭也不回地永遠地去了的呢！在野外，拖着無力的步伐，在深夜裏對若黯黯的燈光，想起了也曾有過好的生命，也曾有過美麗的夢想和可愛的笑的事，眼淚便在悲苦的追懷中沉沉地落下來。世人心理  李輝英　　—湖上雜話之一—　　遊過西湖的人，怕沒有不知道岳墳的吧？到過岳墳的人，怕沒有不留心細看秦檜石像的吧？　　以我自己來論，就有這種心理。因爲從前聽別人說過岳墳中秦檜石像受窘的情形的現在身臨其境，自然先要在這上面看個究竟了。　　可是我在武穆的石像旁尋求好半天，他生前的寃家對頭秦檜王氏之流的石像時，怎樣也找不到。　　我有些着急了，問黃先生道：　　「黃先生，秦檜的石像呢？」　　黃先生可說是老杭州，她在坑州敎過六七年書，所以她這次作了我們的先導，眞是再適宜再難得沒有的了。　　「那邊呢。」　　她轉回身，伸着一柄新買的洋傘笑着回答。　　跟着她傘尖指示的方向，讓我們看到了兩個跪立的鐵人，面上身上沾滿污泥。　　一看這種樣子，禁不住笑了起來，就在這時，旁邊圍觀的人還在繼續着給這昔日的宰相以羞辱，人們有的拋石子，有的噴着吐沫，還有人從石身上摔着鼻涕。　　「這是惡人惡報麽？」　　在思量着。人世上，果然作惡的人，或是害人的人，都不能得好的下塲麼？其實，這又算得什麽事.生前旣未受辱，死後扮演的作做劇對於本人果有損失麼？如果每人的靈魂不滅，讓作惡人的靈魂遭受一點屈辱，這倒是值得的，否則，那只不過給別人一種空虛的慰藉，或是留給人一些要笑的材料罷了。　　然而無論如何，這鐵像的鑄成還是有意義的，恐怕這中間附有一種敎訓在看，那就是警戒後人且莫作奸人，後人會因此笑脫大牙的。只要中國人都能作忠良，不也很好麼。　　然後到大殿裏去觀光，效法別人我抽了一籤，還不錯，籤是上上，三句說明是：　　「賦納以言明試以功車服以庸」　　今年大概我要富貴榮華了。希望此後的生活能在上上的籤上前進，那就好了。人們怕都是希望着自己一天比一天好的吧？世人心理恐怕多是這樣的。巨卿先生（十六）  柯靈　　『但是你爲什麽還敎這些古書！』章校長突然嚴肅起來，用手指指瘦長子和倒掛眉毛的敎員挾着的幾本綫裝書。　　「這個，這個……這是學生的爹娘指定要教，眞沒法！不是指定的，我們老果敎新法書了。」巨卿先生分辯着，把說話的聲音放得極度的溫和。　　可是章校長的臉色變得更嚴厲。　　「不行！」他堅次地說：「敎育局的章程不准敎！」　　那樣的氣勢威熖，恐怕祗有法官審問狡獪奸刁的囚犯才用得着。但一個初出茅廬的後生小子却用了這種態度來對待巨卿先生。這樣的後生巨卿先生本來就十分鄙簿，尤其是，他想起了剛才那一張「敬告學生家屬書」，非但文句寫得不够暢達，而且還寫了別字。這般寡學的小子也那樣的咄咄逼人嗎？巨鄉先生的憤怒烈火似地冒起來，他覺得自己受了不可忍耐的侮辱　　默然無語，勉力隱忍着，蒼老的面上却又漸漸鐵靑了。　　「什麽學生的爹娘指定要敎，你們這些私塾根本就是……誤人子弟！」　　巨卿先生微微顫抖着。久久的隱忍以後，吶吶地說：　　「好罷，我明年不再敎古書了，現在……請各位原諒！」　　「明年？」章校長很快地回駁，像拋在墻上猛力地反射過來的皮球：。「明年明年，你騙誰！敎育局的規矩是不准敎的，現在你是有意……老實說，你們這種，這種，『頭腦冬烘』，根本就是誤人……不配敎書。」　　說巨卿先生不配敎書是對於這老人們的最大的辱沒，而且「頭腦冬哄」道四個字又那麼刺耳，巨卿先生這一下氣得牙齒也擠的格格作響，爆發的感情巳到了揭制不住的時候。　　『先生，這話太『言重』了，我祇敎古書，可是沒有敎別字呢。』　　那個面一紅。瘦長子和倒掛眉毛的敎員在旁邊似乎也變了色。　　年靑的章校長吼着：　　「這話是什麽意思！你說我們敎別字嗎？」　　空氣立刻嚴重起來。三個敎員逼着巨卿先生嬰他拿出敎別字的證據，說他破壞名譽，開始用着各種恐嚇和威脅的手段來應用着……於是，不可避免的衝突終於發生了。　　巨卿先生用顫呌着的聲音說；「好，那麽我請敎你們幾個字，要是我姓孔的錯了，我從此不敎書！」中國藝術國際展覽會出口過目記（二）  曹聚仁　　依着陳列室的順序，我用隨感錄式來約略談一談，避開太專門的學究話頭。　　進門樓下第一室，陳列明淸書畫，織繡，摺扇等等，明人的作品都不怎樣傑出，老爺太太們看見唐白虎，文徵明的就擠住了看，那全靠三笑笑緣吹噓的力量。我愛藍瑛秋老梧桐那一幅（一四二）剪裁着色都很好，畫出一個「老字」。淸人作品中，以淸世祖的墨鍾馗爲最劣，（一四七）鍾馗本來討人厭，墨鐘馗更使人作嘔。比較的，鄒一桂的盎春生意，（一六五）徐揚的雨景山水，（一七〇）還別有風格。織繡中宋繡白鷹，（十五）淸緙絲銅柱銘勳，（二十一）淸緙絲村農韶慶（二十）都可愛，「村農韶慶」那幅更可愛。全幅圖成因家的快樂，庭中老幼向火取樂，階前媳婦兒在春米，小兒扶着老人的拐杖跳躍着歸來，怡然的情况活現在紙上。我是農家子，我所以愛他　　樓上第二室，陳列宋元書畫。元人的作品，我只愛吳廷暉的龍舟奪標圖，河上奪標人和岸上看賽人的神情相爲呼應。元帝的像冊和元后像冊，肥頭肥腦，笨得有趣。趙孟頫的七札冊，嫵娼可喜，有人怪他的人品不好，其實那也正是讀書人的本色。宋人作品，好的很多。卽如宋太宗畫像，就是一幅好畫。宋太祖的畫像，畫出一般流氓神情，撲質的好；許多人怪他不是紅臉孔，那當然是趙匡胤的錯。我最愛夏珪的長江萬里圖卷，驚濤駭浪，引縴在前，刺篙在後，是實生活的寫照。趙伯駒的春山圖，（二十三）點染春色極好，一望使人感到溫暖的氣息。還有他所作的阿閣圖，（二十四）以色彩烘出享樂的情累也極好。李迪的風雨歸牧，（二十一）小小局面，生動可喜。歷代畫幅集冊中有周一元素淵明逸致圖，畫淵明酣醉，倩人扶歸；所謂田園詩人的風度，大概如此。此外還有三幅唐人畫，二幅五代人畫，我只在李昭道的洛陽樓，（一）前面看了一回，抬頭看見乾隆御書「自作千古」四個字，便有些頭痛，不再看下去了。我這樣以書畫門外漢來評長論短，所謂美術家一定大爲頭痛。好在預展會那會所的樓梯邊，有一幅磁磚砌成的西洋名畫；參觀的人能不對那幅畫悠然神往，魷算是我說錯好了。　　第三室陳列銅器。銅器分四類；一，烹飪器及食器類，二，容器溫器及飲器類，三，尋常用器類，四，樂器類；其他還有新鄭及壽縣所發見的銅器羣。這樣分類，顯明地指示紀元前十個世紀的生活實際，是一幅活的文化圖畫。（關於銅器的時代和地域以及在藝術上在史料上的價值，在出品目錄上有很簡括精確的說明，不待我來多說。）商民族在東方所經營的文化，從這些器物的裝飾和文字，可以知道那時已經達到怎樣的高度；有許爲地方可以證明商文化是融合許多地方的文化而產生的。前人說周代尙文，文化程度比商民族高的話，我們也得加以否認；周器的裝飾和文字，有些實在比商器質樸得多。東周以後器物形式文字變化之多，使我們可以想像民族混合後地方文化發展的猛進。器物之中，有雕成饕餮形，又有幾何形，鸞紋蟠螭形，蟠虺形，圖爪形，耳形種種，這是藝術起源於生活的最好說明。新鄭出土和壽縣出土那些銅器，看起來頗不雅觀，（少奶奶所謂齷齪得來）但地方色彩非常濃厚，拿這些來和殷周器物相比較，很可以看出文野的分別，自然「野一也有「野」的風味。</p>

<p>申報本埠增刊談言自殺事件  夢若　　上海社會的不安定，從自殺案件的有增無減一點上可以看得出。每日披閱本地各日報的社會新聞，這裏時常很觸目的使你找到了一兩件自殺的消息。這不斷　生出來的一件件的自殺案，分明在告示你：目前上海社會，正有不少人已感到生存的艱難，不能不走上最終的路程！　　日昨本市社會局發表了一份本市二十三年度的自殺統計：計全年自殺案二三二五件，眞中男子一一二二人，女子一二零三人。自殺原因：以口角紛爭爲最多，次爲經濟壓迫，又次爲家庭事故。自殺結果：計死者五零一人，被救者一八一六人，未詳者八人。自殺者年齡：以二十一歲至三十歲爲最多，計一一四一人，次爲三十一歲至四十歲者，計四六一人，又次爲二十歲者，計四三八人。　　據社會局報告，去年本市自殺案數目之鉅，爲歷年所未有。若年以三六五日計，則平均每日本市有六件以上的自殺事件發生，每四時平均發生一件。這數目實在呌人吃驚，十分值得關心社會問題者的注意！　　自殺事件的層出不窮，是社會上一種不良的現象。這種不良現象的發生，有的歸咎於個人意志的薄弱，有的指責於社會環境的壓迫。然依我們的觀察，兩者都是造成自殺案件發生的原因，而尤以後者比前者更爲重要。故要救濟自殺，自不得不從這兩方面去設想。　　可是今日的上海社會，是一個不健全的畸形社會。這個社會裏面，早着各種各樣的病態。一個人處在這個社會中，生活不免要受到一種極可怕的威脅。故我們以爲本市自殺案件，在現在還無法使之减少！礦區小市  拓人　　火車疾馳的穿過了，叢林，跳進眼廉的就是一個沉深的山谷，四而盡是高峻的山峯環繞着。這兒已是到了產煤的礦區了。　　火車的鐵輪緩緩地在山坡上曲曲折折地滾動着，跨過一條小小地水淸得看見下面的石子的小山澗，就進了籠罩在四面高聳着黑色的煤堆的月台。　　月台上的人稀少得沒有一點生氣，在人羣中我被擠下了那黑色的車廂。幾個做小買賣的孩子，提着竹籃在站上呌賣，可是一下子，人都走散了。幾個老頭子從車廂中搬下了那在城裏賣不完的水菓，很失意似地壓在肩膀上，望着鐵軌後面走去。站在車站室門口的人，搖動着綠色的旗子吹一聲銀笛，火車，一長串的車廂望着月台後面蠕動的開過去了。軍站上，又復歸於沉寂。賣食物的小孩子們，却還苦着臉呆呆地坐在月台的木凳上、他們是在等待着二點鐘後的再從城裏開來的一列車了。走下了月台，穿過了橫臥在煤屑上的鐵軌，不到一百步展開在前面的就是一條小小的街市。　　在四面環繞着高峯的這充滿着媒烟的山谷中，這街市，就是居留在這裏的成萬住民的唯一的市鈸，一切都集中在這一條狹小的街上。　　假如在都市裏，像這樣不滿二百間的小店排在一起，也許還是一條幽靜的地方，可是在這裏，却是顯出了執鬧，人物是像大都市中的繁盛的馬路上那樣的擁擠着，每個角落裏都響着嘈雜的聲音。　　路面，這楚一條碎石子舖成的，在人們的脚的壓踏之下，和做買賣者的污水的亂潑，是變成一條濘滑的泥路了。很少是有一塊乾凈土的。在這裏的房屋雖只有二百來問，排起來也是那麽短短地從頭到尾也不上數百步，可是這裏，却是各色各樣的商店都有着，旅館，飯店，洋貨店，雜貨店，酒樓，茶館，炭舖，米行，浴室，一切都齊備，恍惚是大都市的街道了。在這裏的行人，却是除了精神飽滿而準備到礦洞裏去做工的以及從礦洞裏工作得疲倦而歸來的工人們之外，就是鄉間的婦女和小孩，再也看不見有另」種人的存在了。我們是很偶然的來客而已。　　已經是黃昏的時候到了。從早農到了這時在途中的踄涉，精神已經是感到疲倦了。一羣的人，被旅館張開着的大門吞了進去。　　旅館在這街上，是有兩家，我們的一羣已經就佔滿了一家的十幾間小房子了。住在這樣的旅館裏，是比那住在都市的鳥籠式的亭子間裏還有沉悶些。可是旅人的疲倦的身軀躺在床上却會感到格外的舒適，好似走進了極樂的世界。　　夜，黑布似的把大地包住着。昏黃的煤油燈，在寂靜的街心上閃動着。沉沉地却傳來了一陣音樂的聲音合女人的歌唱在饗奏着。　　「這裏還有什麼唱戲的姑娘嗎？」　　坐在黑暗的旅館的大門口底木凳上，我問着那旅館里的一個小使伴。　　「有的。有唱的，有睡的。妓院這裏有兩家。夜裏那茶館裏魷有姑娘在唱，呌來也可以，價錢很便宜。」　　那小使伴很淸楚的告訴我，還好似給她們拉生意似的說得很明白。　　「這裏花頭到不少。」　　「那裏？在幾年前這裏眞熱鬧哩！生意不單做這確區，山前山後的村里都是到裏做買賣的。近年來因田裏收成不好，礦工的工資减得太多，所以這裏才落得這樣冷淸淸哩！要不然，比城裏還熱鬧些。」　　小使伴鼓了半天嘴才咕嚕出這一些話來。可是從他的話裏却可推想到幾年前的鄉村是多麼繁榮呀！夜食  華木　　在上海，雖然有着無數人羣，輾轉在生活的鐵輪下，日中不得一飽，但除了一部分過若天堂生活的也還有大羣住看衖堂房子，組茶淡飯，平平淡淡過着日子的人。假如汝就是屬於這個中間層的份子，那也未常不是有點淸福了。過着這種的日子，汝雖然不會就讚美上海爲人間的天堂，極樂的世界，但至少汝總不願在隨便的條件下離開牠，有許多地方，會呌汝意識到上海到底是可愛的　　衖堂生活固然有許多陋劣不堪的成份雜摻在那里，然也有許多特點，完美無憾的給汝以情趣的滿足。這種情趣，淸福，自然非住茅房的飢餓羣，和住公館，公寓的「驕子」們所能領略享受到的。　　當市聲稍沉的夜心，衖堂漸漸轉入於睡的靜態。一聲一聲賣夜食的椅梆子聲和悠長而靜純的低喊悠揚有致的打窗子脚下過去，這時侯，汝或者正睡在床上，或者還在白熱的燈光下玩味着心愛的書本，聽着這種流溢着誘感力的聲韻，一種又似空靈，又似濃厚的情趣，偷偷的從心頭爬出來，汝再也不會恨怕牠會擾亂女的心思睡意。汝能夠用熟悉準確的體會，分別出那一種聲韻是賣什麼。這是餛飩呢。那是廣東之味的魚生粥呀……　　這担過去了，遠遠的漸進漸近的又換上一担来。聽着，數着，饞慾湧上喉頭，書也念不下了，睡思也飛去了，全失了理智的自制，給催眠着似的，於是，摸了一下腰包，饞意飛揚的靠着窗探首外向，喊一聲。　　—喂，來一碗！　　或是。　　—一碗魚生粥！　　這會見，立卽就有一個謙和帶着狡猾的應聲回過來。　　—嗬餛飩一碗。　　靜靜的桌子上面，於是飛起烟影一般輕妙的熟氣。香味，刺着汝的具子，汝舒徐地翹起兩隻手指，捻着湯匙，舀着胃着墊氣佳品，一匙一匙的往嘴里送。這時汝再不會使出用餐時的囫圇粗亂的態度，自自然然流露出嫺雅的風度，細細的咀嚼，深味。等會，兩片嘴唇沾粘上薄薄的汕膩，碗也空了，兩隻角子就向汝道一聲。再會。飛去了。　　可是，汝放心，角子雖然飛云了，汝也不會生起後悔來的。情趣的慾壑得到了圓潤的滿足，再無他求了，抹過口，抽一支香烟，魷可酣然入夢。　　若果汝的三樓主人也是曉得享受夜食風趣的趣客，那麼當上面把一隻小籃吊一碗香噴噴的佳　打在窗口經過，這會汝的心頭，又另有一種無可形容的喜悅的戚受。如吃佛山盲公糖，又香又酣，又脆又酥，味不出牠的味兒究竟是那一樣好，因爲他在同樣的要求下，已作了汝的同志，兩人雖然見不着面，可已心領神會作着會心的微笑了。　　不過這種夜食風趣也因時令而分濃淡。在夏夜，通常都不見得如何有味兒。因爲衖堂房子的悶熱程度，雖在夜心也還會呌汝流汗。在這種心情下，是不會使汝想起穿　而過的夜食担的。最合適的當然要首推冬夜與秋夜。塵世  嬰子　　從剛　開始懂得一點世事的時候，不知爲了別種的什麽綠故，他們便被父親送到南山當沙彌去了。　　從那時直到現在，足足有七八個悠久的年頭，他們沒有瞧見父母一面之綠了，所以，關於他們父母的容顏，姿態，在他們童稚的腦海裏，簡直烙印不上一個顯明的記憶啦。因此，他們的心中，到這時感到那麽的孤零，悲悽，以爲他們是無父無母，無姊無妹，無親無戚的人了。所以有時在暗地裏他們往往戚旣着自己那種不幸的身世。在這樣孤苦伶仃的時候，徐了將這顆充滿了憂鬰和傷感的心事訴之於佛道之外，他們沒有什麽可以解愁的法子了。　　他們常常聽到上人說到關於「塵世」的事，他們的心中，就憧憬着人間是如何險惡，煩惱，污濁，醜惡，充滿着那些猛獸，毒蛇，魔鬼之類底東西。所以目前他們雖然被懷念着父母這念頭所苦痛，但一想活在這樣「下世」之下的人們，反而覺得他們自己是幸福不過的了。然而這幸福，在他們的腦中是如何消失得那麽迅速啊！當他們的年紀漸漸長大起來的時候，生理上底銳變和人性上一種自然的要求發作的時候，無論如何他們也不能抑制得住自己底慾望了。對於所謂「不堪的塵世」，他們常常引起種種的幻像，縱使他們不想落到「人間」來嘗試嘗試那邊的風味，但心裏確實想明白下「塵世到底是怎樣回事啊！」　　有一天，大哥趁着上人不在的時候，用那種疑惑的氣問着弟弟：　　「照上人的話，塵世是空虛的，幻境的，醜惡的，但在我近來所得的印像，并不是那樣的呵！塵世那邊一樣有富麗堂皇的細閣，幽雅精緻的園林，淸山綠水，明媚春光，一切的似乎不亞於山上哩。」　　「不錯」，弟弟回答「塵世也許與山上沒有多大的區別，但哥哥呀，你記不起上人的話了嗎？那邊最壞的，最污穢的，是一種罪惡之根原的，那就是女人呵！有了女人，塵世就不能和山上可比了。」弟弟非常自信地。　　「那麼說，女人一定是種可惡的動物了……」大沙彌於是疑惑似的瞧瞧小沙彌，之後，他低聲說「但依我最近的觀察，并不是那樣呀，你沒有看見嗎？當那些少女，穿上紅紅綠綠的衣裳來到山上供奉佛仙的時候，她們那種溫文雅柔的舉動，嬌豔的姿態，和她們那些深情的眼睛，光滑的面龐，我看和仙女一般的沒有多大的分別呀，聽說上人時常背着我們偷偷地下山去找尋那些女人行樂。上人口里念着是高超的經文，但心中所盤據的是這所謂「污濁的塵世」呀。所以對於佛道我已經引起一種罪惡的不良之念了。其實，我想只要我們不做惡事，不受誘惑，本着我們一片純潔的心情，我以爲到處都是一樣的。…」　　弟弟只點點頭，對於大沙彌的話覺得似信不信的樣子。業餘信箱法律上承繼財產權編者先生：　　我是一個知識淺薄的店員，也算是一個毫無判斷力的人。在最近却過到一個自問極難解决的問題，所以不得不來麻煩你了，請你給我一個明確的指示。　　事實是這樣的：我有一位伯父和一位叔父。伯父和我父親都是在鄉里以敎書爲生，而叔父在少年時候，就出外經商，賺了很多錢，近幾年來才回鄉享福。不遇他雖巳有五十多歲，却沒有一個兒子。在四年前，曾有立我爲嗣的意思，那時我還在外績書，不知爲了什麽打消了，後來便立伯父的兒子爲嗣。不過那族兄（伯父的兒子）不上正軌，竟和流氓爲伍，常常向叔父要錢去賭博，吃酒，嫖妓，眞是無惡不作。叔父氣極了，乃被他驅逐出去，伯父也不收留他，於是他就飄流在外面，已經有兩年多沒有信息了。最近叔父又和我父親商議，要我做他的嗣子。對於這件事，我們當然沒有什麽異議，不過問題却發生了：因爲我那族兄現在雖然被逐，但一定不肯放棄這項財產。將來他和我糾纏，我如何應付？他有沒有向我法律起訴的理由？敬請撰安　申斌敬上　　編者按：民法繼承篇第一千一百四十三條規定：「無直系血親卑親屬者，得以遺囑就少，財產之全部或一部，指定繼承人，但以不違反關於特留部份之規定時爲規。」所以申君的叔父，當然可以很自由的指定任何人，爲其財產的繼承人。不過因有撫養族兄事實在前，（照來信所述，似還沒有經過正式「退繼的手績。）爲了辨免後來糾紛起見，申君的叔父應趕速向法院，或兼理司法的縣府，將「退繼」（指與族兄）與「立繼」（指與申君）的手續備案，同時要將遺囑立好；照我們的意見，這遺囑應採用「公證遺囑」，方爲妥當。　　上面不過是就法律的立場，來解決這個問題的辦法。但我們卻認為享受不勞而獲的財濟，祇能養成一般人享樂揮霍的習慣，且有消滅靑年進取精神的危險，並不是一件十分可喜的事。所以申君的叔父，假使一定要申君爲其繼承人的話；爲了要使他老人家得到安慰起見，當然不能拒絕。但絕不可認爲這是發橫財的機會啊！申君的責任，就是應當設法將族兄尋回，導其於正。一個人在受了絕大刺激之後，是很容易去邪歸正的。那時申君更當在叔父前，善爲關說，恢復他們的關係。至於叔父的財產，不妨各承半數。這樣旣不致使他老年人失望於現在，又可顧全弟兄的感情，而自己也不致失去相當利益：這是最妥當，最高尙的辦法。　　最後，因爲申君的族兄，能否决心向善，尙未可知，我們以爲法律手續，仍須及早辦妥，俾得權操自我，這就是計策萬全的意思。無綫電播音節目彈詞　　蔣如庭朱介生落霞孤騖　　中

<p>申報本埠增刊　電影專刊小牧師特刊傑姆士白尼名著「小牧師」攝成影片之始末  曉聲　　（一）出版後之風行一時　　傑姆士白尼爵士所著，舉世咸知的文壇傑作一「小牧師」，爲着世人的渴望，現在是把牠搬上有聲的銀慕上了。主角巴白娜，是由那位超絕銀壇的天才演員，凱絲玲赫本担任的　　當他執筆寫這本關於一個吉普西女郞和一位牧師的情史的時候，白尼眞想不到四十三年之後，這一個故事竟會在有聲電影裏，去給全球千萬的人士去欣賞。　　這本小說自從一八九一年初版之後，就轟動全球，一再的翻印。後來，原作者又把牠寫成了劇本，先後已經拍成了兩張默片。並且在無線電裹也時常在播送着。現在攝成有聲影片，無疑地是更加會轟動一時，而給世人們一個更深切的了解。　　一八九一年，「小牧師」是每日刋登在倫敦的一本雜誌裏。同年年底，「小牧師」的單行本就和世人作初次的見面。這一本有聲有色，纒綿悽惻的戀愛史，立刻就一紙風行，受盡千百萬人的讚嘆。而作這本小說的背景，也是作者的故鄉的「森林」村，也就成爲舉世知名的勝地。當時美國的報紙已相率刋登。據最近調查，這本『小牧師』單在美國銷行，已經超過一百萬本。出版界還在不斷地在翻印着。更因爲雷電華的製片成功，無形中，這本不朽偉著的銷路，就格外的增加了。　　（二）改成劇本同樣成功　　無疑地「小牧師」是可以製成劇本的。一八九七年，作者自已把牠寫成劇本。當時的人，對於這劇本，其歡迎讚誦的狂熱，正如他們以對於這本小說的情形一樣。　　不久，這劇本傳入美洲，給那時的戲劇大王卻爾士福羅門得着。戲劇演出之後，全美轟傳。而劇中當主角的亞當小姐就立刻紅極一時。她在百老匯連續的表演「小牧師」一劇，足有三百塲。後來她挾「小牧師」一劇，週遊全美表演。可是倫敦的人們，却等到一九一四年才有眼福看到「小牧師」在「約克公爵」大戲院開演。一九三四年，亞當小姐又在紐約全國無線電臺把「小牧師」播音。一直至一九三五年，羅絲蔡德頓在紐約繼續亞當小姐來主演這戲。而劇本也改善了許多。默片時代攝製中的挫折  飛特　　默片時代，已有許多人在渴望着把「小牧師」搬上銀壇。維太風公司當時就把這「小牧師」的小說本開始攝製。但是經過一些小小的挫折之後，就把工作停頓了。　　一九二一年，派拉蒙决定把牠製成影片。風聲一洩，維太風立刻出面反對派拉蒙的攝製權。可是派拉蒙却聰明地把兩本劇本版權都收買了過來，秘密地去攝製。這事卒於給維太風知道了，也就趕緊的將這「小牧師」的小說本日夜開工去趕製。結果，這兩張「小牧師」的無聲片子却差不多同時在美國的銀幕上演出。　　雷電華公司現在已把這部四十多年來的不朽巨著攝成有聲影片，給「小婦人」的主角凱絲玲赫本和約翰比爾再度合作。這位劇本的原作者自尼爵士得了這個消息，老遠的從蘇格蘭打電報來雷電華公司道賀說：「鄙人深慶貴公司能有這樣好的演員如凱絲玲赫本小姐來飾巴白娜的角色。」都羅姆的風景使她留連不忍去  慧目　　「小婦人」的攝製中，雷電華公司所最感到繁重的工作，就是要建造一個蘇格蘭的都羅姆村。都羅姆村是十八世紀的名稱。現在己經改作吉立穆爾村了。　　在好萊塢一家大公司的經濟能力下，這所蘇格蘭的小村，居然在加利福尼亞的山蔭中造成。它非但和蘇格蘭的鄉村風味，一模一樣，它還確是一固絕美的藝術乍品。乍者就是蘇格蘭式建築和風景佈置的一般專家。　　那裏有可愛的都羅姆村，那就是「小婦人」原著作人傑姆士白雷爵士的故居。那裏後面有高崇的林都爾古堡，那係按照古時諾曼式的堡壘建築的。那堡中有仰之彌高的屋頂，有石壁，有五彩玻璃鑲嵌而成的窗，有偉大的鐵門，有高崇的石階　　再回到村中，那裏有貧苦的紡織人聚居之所。那裹有市政堂，有公衆的廣塲，有鐵匠鋪，有老婦人蘭莉的破屋，有敎堂，有「小牧師」的住宅　　那裏還有山。山上有風車，山下有紡織的羣衆，作為瞭望之用的看臺，預期兵士來攻的時候，可以振臂一呼，千夫立就的。　　在這許多優美的風景之中，這一般人，由導演立却華雷斯領導著，天天在拍着戲，主演「小婦人」的凱絲玲赫本，在這裏飾着「小牧師」的情人，天天在這個地方徜徉著，等到「小牧師」拍完了之後。她却留連着不肯去了。因爲這樣的天然風景，經過了幾個月相處之後，巳成了她的故鄉了。　　「小牧師」中凱絲玲赫本，約翰比爾，及亞蘭海爾三人之表演　　「小牧師」中極動人怡　之一幕。蘭莉（藝術戈登飾）以殘年將盡之者婦，將被逐於地主，而送入養老院中。適巴白娜（凱沙玲赫本飾）來，亟自承其生活費而留之於其舊居。老婦不覺爲之感極汍瀾云。　「小牧師」攝製中凱絲玲的自攝影片  思齊　　凱絲玲赫本女士，現在收藏着巨量的特別異常的影片。這是因爲從她主演的巨片」小牧師」那裏攝得來的。　　當「小牧師」在攝製的時候，她就用着一架手提攝影機自己去牧攝。當她自己在表演的時候，她就會請她的朋友來攝影，另外還請人替她自己的片子收音。　　她對於攝製影片，旣然有這麼的高興，所以在家裏，她自己有實騐室，也有有聲電影的設備。她自己收藏着「小牧師」影片的特別地方，不是在多了一套的影片。却是在片子裏她攝取了許多演員，臨時演員，她自己和她的朋友，也都攝了進去。這些都是正式片子裏面完全沒有的。　　一陣擾亂後之歸途中，巴白娜復與小牧師相值，依樹小談之神情那個清越的鐘聲終究被他們找着了  東陸　　溫柔地，諧和地，從畫般的蘇格蘭地方一個小敎堂裹發出來的鐘聲。爲了要眞純起見，雷電華攝製「小牧師」就需要找這種鐘的聲音。　　無論什麽形式，怎樣大小的鐘他們都試驗過了，但是總找不到像「小牧師」裏面那間奧力小敎堂所應有的鐘聲。　　雷電華公司裹面考查部的主任，貝茜夫人，卒於親往落杉磯拜訪那位天主敎的主敎克華爾先生，請敎他，在他管轄下的敎堂裏面，可還有這樣的一只鐘。結果，他告訴了貝茜夫。在聖維多敎堂裏面還有一只這樣的鐘。經了試驗之後，他們所需望的鐘聲，卒於尋着了。收音部得着主敎的允許，就把那踏破天涯覓處的鐘聲，請了來攝取它的聲音。銀幕追踪文學「小牧師」永垂不朽  流沙　　五十年來，最受歡迎，始終不衰的小說—這就是傑姆士白尼爵士的文學不朽巨著「小收師」了。　　現在雷電華公司已把這部舉世聞名的偉作，給萬人景仰的天才藝員凱絲玲赫本女士主演，搬上了銀幕。據對於這部片子攝製有關係的人們觀察，這本銀壇的絕作，將來的結果，一定會像白尼爵士的原著一樣的永傳不朽的。　　雷電華公司的工作人們，絞盡了他們的腦汁，使這本片子的進展和那本小說的筆法，一樣的有神情。將那本不朽巨著的實質，盡量地貢獻給愛好銀壇藝術的人們去欣賞。　　片子裏除了任主角的凱絲玲赫本和飾小牧師的約翰比爾無容介紹外，其他的配角，都無一不是一時之選的演員。　　兵士與村民激戰中，吉普西少女巴白娜野性大發，協助村民以敵兵士們之前的表情小牧師男主角約翰比爾小史  暢　　多數的舞台演員，倘若是要衝進電影圈裹去的話，他們一定要經過種種困難，才有他插足的地方。　　約翰比爾的悄形却不是這條。他是被好萊塢禮聘了來，主演他的舞台名劇呌「別種方言」“Another　Languange”的。他成功之後，因爲他不肯和人家簽訂什麽合同的原故，所以他就跑回到舞臺上去。　　可是不久又被電華公司的堅邀，重新回到影城來主演「妻的悄人」“Hat，Coat，＆Gloves”。他表演藝術的成功，他就給雷電華公司派定了，和凱絲玲赫本合演世界開名的文學鉅著「小牧師」Lilttle　Minister他那爐火純靑的藝術，和着天賦的表演奇材，除了在「小收師」裏面得到莫大的成功之外，他現在已簽訂了再拍一張新片的合同。　　比爾是德國和愛爾蘭血統的混合秈子。他的眞名字是叫作傑姆士亞力山大百洛頓。他在高級中學表演戲劇是他頭一次的上舞台。後來在賓士上溫尼亞大學，他就加入一著名劇社作演員。他表演的技術，就給紐約戲劇界賞識了。　　可是他第一次正式上舞台表演的地方，却是安哈婷在受訓練和得到成功的海德樓大戲院。他返到紐約，有一個時期。是完全停止了舞台生活，而加入了一間學生藝術聯合會去研究。後來法蘭克所作的名劇“That’s　Gratiude”完成，他又重度他的舞台生活，不斷地發展他底藝術光芒。　　比爾的身材是五尺十一寸高。一百十一磅重。他口常生活最嗜好的是溜氷和繪畫。游泳和網球都是他歡喜的運動。</p>

<p>梅琪伊文斯所說她不願做女明星的理由（下）  新尼　　「我亦常常這樣想，如果我僅僅做了一位女領導人，我所得的報酬，比做一位明星還多。譬如說，一個女演員被人家轟了起來，做了一個明星，她立卽魷被人認成某一作風的角色（　）。她的作風一旦被大衆所認定之後，就不能再變動了。她雖然一心一意的想扮演別種的角色，但是已經再沒有希望的了。　　當一個電影脚本送進了公司之後，公司的頭腦略爲看了一看，魷說：『這齣悲對於某某，是再好沒有的了。她那種悲傷的表演，楚人人喜歡看的。』他們或者說：『這種鄉村的羅曼斯，是不合於某某的作風的。退回去。她不能扮演農家女子的。她的觀衆看了，都會從戲院裏走出去的。』　　公司的當局亦沒有法子，他們祇好惟觀衆之意楚從。所以一個女明星，在第一次扮演一種角色成名之後，就得永遠的扮演那個角色，直到她老了，或是觀衆們看厭了爲止。女領導人，或是特別演員，却是運氣好些，她不至於被列爲某一種類，而失去其他表演的機會。　　再則每一個未婚的女子，都有些羅曼諦克的夢想，要想會見她理想中的人情的。我現在做了特別演員就可以常常和千萬女子所崇拜的男明星會見。我差不多和所有的男明星，都合演過戲。和一般的普通女子一樣，當我和克拉克蓋博，羅勃蒙高茂萊，或是雷門諾伐羅合拍電影的時候，我就覺得非常的偷快。我到了好萊塢，已經有三年之久，而這次我才得到一些假期。因此這三年以來忽忙之中，我已經和多少男明星合拍過戲，亦就可想而知了。倘使我做了一個明星，我就沒有這許多好機會了。　　我們做演員的，在表演的小動作上面，總有一種別的形態，而觀衆們在看戲的時候，就不知不覺的希望看到那些小動作的流露出來。所以我們有影戲的時候，常常聽見旁座的人說：『他怯要從耳　了』，或是『她快要低下睫毛，口微微顫動，表示失望了。』這種預測，在老於看戲的影迷，十次之中有九次是猜得中的。我覺得一個明星的小動作，變成了刻板式，是很危險的。是自已常常審查我的動作，我面部的表情，不讓我自己成功一種呆板的習慣。但是我因爲不是一個明星，可以時常扮演着各色各樣的角色，於我小動作方面的變化，是有了極大的帮助。　　我還有一個理由，使我不願意做一個明星。常明我拍攝「塊肉餘生」的時候，我嘗到了異樣的與趣。我常常站在攝影塲中，看許多大藝太家的表演。那裏有里昂巴里穆亞，愛娜梅奧立芙，肯勃爾古柏，弗蘭克勞頓，華德　爾資等。我看了他們表演的神乎其技，我就覺得我應該怎樣的刻苦學習，才可以好這些大藝術領袖，同站在一個平等的地位。　　那不單單在一頭的金黃頭髮一副秀麗的眉目，一個苗條的身段，或是怎樣的誘惑力。要做一等的明星，需要多年的刻苦工作。她的神經系統，應當是橡皮做的，好被擊下一百萬次，一百萬次的反躍起來。此外她還要有些天才，好在你已經獲得了一等地位之後，能自已維持下去。　　我因爲年紀還輕，所以有很大的抱負。但是我亦不是小孩子，應當自己知道自己的限制。並且我的常識，告訴我要脚踏實地。我沒有什麽動會處。在這一點，見仁貝智。自然觀念不同，但我却自以爲幸。我亦不能算美麗，聰明，具有異樣情調，或有驚人之處。我亦沒有學過跳舞，唱歌，彫刻或油畫。我不過楚一個以在銀幕上表演的職業的女子。但我在攝影塲之外，我可以忘記，我是個女演員。我可以逍遙自在，無拘無束。那就因爲我不是一個明星的原故。」（完）影片談評評「孤島飄流記」  繼漢　　Menor　Aran—國泰　　被改譯作「孤島飄流記」的名作「亞倫島的人們」是記錄影片。　　關於記錄影片，以前也曾看過記錄天文的，但却一時記不起那影片的名字，雖然它也曾給與我一個深的印象。同時我也記得那一部作品並沒有拋粱故事的結構，並不像這一影片完全沒有故事的形式。在這裏似乎有「記錄影片」是否應當有故事？—這一問題頗值得研究一下　　當觀衆從鑒賞習慣上，不能在無故事的影片中得着滿足的時候，有故事的記錄影片，是更足以增加鑒賞者的興趣。即如范達克的「愛斯基摩」，假使也是記錄影片的話，那末他是成功了的。他將愛斯基摩的人們的生活，習慣，以及他們和大自然戰鬥，描畫他們在白種人的欺騙，與詐取之下所遭受着種慘遇，以後者爲故事的綫索，再以前者的種種編織在故事中間。但是「愛斯基摩」，人們不會將它歸入記錄影片一類。而前面說到那天象記錄的影片，却又因着故事的着重，使「記錄」本身反而成爲附屬的穿挿。　　記錄影片在蘇聯是作爲重要的課題，被研究與實踐着，如會經在新光開映「莫斯科之朝」便是好例。那兒完全沒有故事的形式，作者充分的使用音樂的Tempo將片斷的新聞片織接起來。但是一部短片，比較容易獲得效果些，至少觀衆們是不會因之厭頃的。　　現在我們又看到這一部沒有故事作中心的「亞倫島的人們」了，這是八千呎以上的長片。大概看過這一影片的人們，特別是要求曲折離奇，悲歡離合的劇情的人們，對於這一影片不會十分滿足的，而且會因着對於單調而感覺枯澀。這不能不是一般共同的感覺。這樣說來，未嘗不是作品在效果上的損失。　　現在我們來看這一影片所表現着的一切罷。再明顯沒有的，作者告訴我們人類爲了生存，得以大無畏的精神，繼續不斷的無休止的和大自然爭鬥。在這亞倫島上的居民，他們沒有樹木，沒有可以種植的土地，因之他們的生存，必需以海藻和岩石縫中的碎土，作爲種植馬鈴薯之用。當他們在採土的時候，他們是那般珍惜不肯拋棄很少的一撮。此外他們的日常生活，便是捕魚，小的魚固然易於到手，而大的莎魚，他們是日以繼夜的捕打着。在海面平靜的時候，海鷗在飢餓的飛翔哀鳴，他們的工作似乎比較容易一些，可是當海中風濤澎湃的時候，他們是拚着性命和大海搏鬥。他們不能戰勝波濤，便得給大海吞沒。他們的生活戰鬥，永遠沒有實止，除非他們給大海吞噬了以致於可怕的休止。　　是的，在這裏表現着人生是何等艱難，你不搏鬥，你就得死。這裹是人類和大自然的搏鬥，而人與人之間的搏鬥，更是何等可怕和殘酷啊！這裏是一首粗獷沉重的詩化的戰鬥呼號聲，這沉重的詩啊，不是謳歌人生，也不是爲悲慘的命運而惋悄，它是戰鬥的吶喊與呼號。它不使話笑，也不使你哭，它只使你體念着人生的意義，沉重的向前邁進。　　是的，這裏楚詩，也是一幅雄偉的黑白分明的祖綫條的木刻，圖畫。假使我們不是盲目者，我們不能不爲這繪畫而感動，不能不對這美麗的攝影大聲讚美。作者羅伯脫林萊赫迭（Robert　Flaherty）他是那樣靈活的處理鏡頭的角度，他對於音響效果也是有機的發揮了獨立的效能，同時在剪接上也是有着優越的成績。　　「春風秋雨」中之一幕（克勞黛　爾白主演）「肝腸寸裂的母親！」南京映電影小說小牧師（Little　Minister）（三）  志　　當巴白娜將到古堡時，她發現防守的哨兵了。她知道她自己一身的吉普西衣服不能通過去的。這時恰巧給她拾到了一件披肩。她正想披着冒險衝過去的時候，却望見覺民從古堡的小路走過來。她就跑出來站在他的旁邊，手勾住了他的臂。當然，覺民一身的牧師衣裳，是毫無困難地給他們通過了。因爲兵十們誤會她楚覺民的妻子。覺民想辯護，却給她用說話阻擋了。她的俏皮，眞把他弄得沒法。　　他們行近了收師的往宅了。裏面還有燈光。覺的說道：「這就是我的住宅。那是我母親房間裏的燈光。」「祗有你的母親嗎？」她問。「祇有，如果你給人家捉着了，那麼人人都知道我是認你作妻子把你放走的。我不是怕人家妁責罰，我是怕良心上的痛苦呢。我的母親你　不曉得。她愛着我，相信着我，指導着我。我現在的有今日，她眞是快活極了。但是倘若今晚的事悄給人家知道了，我的敎會就會把我驅逐出來的。「他說完了，巴白娜就回頭向有兵士的路上去。「你往那裏去？」他隨後呌着。「我去自首去，但你不嬰驚，我不會連累你的。」「不，不要這樣。你等在花園裏，等到路通了再走吧。巴白娜滿腔含淚的說道：「你是好人，我很歡喜你。」可是他驚惶地急着道：「不要這樣說，你在那邊的屋子裏坐着等吧」。　　她坐在花園裏等。她看見房子裏的燈光熄滅。她心裏在幻想他們母子的生活。她覺得他們的生活是她的新經歷。今天早晨，她所思想的衹有她自己的一切。但現在她却認識了一個人，而這個人是完全爲別人服務的。　　有一次她又看見他了。他是去探望一位老婦蘭莉。因爲蘭莉沒有錢，而要被送入養老院了。他來勤慰她。巴白娜剛巧走了來，蘭莉的苦處，感動了她的惻隱之心。她答應供給她錢。使她仍然得住在這裏。這樣一來，她就想到了法子，每個星期都可以和小牧師會面。因爲她答應了小牧師，每星期給錢請他拿去送給蘭莉。覺民不得不答應了她。那時的蘭莉，感激得流着淚謝道：「謝謝你小姐。從此我就可以安心了。我希望你也是永遠的安樂。」巴白娜傷心地答道：「我的命還是不會安樂的了。」說完，就道着晚安走了。覺民也跟着出來說道：「「我希望你的命運不會不安的。」巴白娜忙問道：「你眞的擔心我的事囑？」「眞的，」他誠摯地說。「這是因爲你不了解我。」「這是因爲我了解你。」巴白娜答着道：「你認識了我還不久呢。」「巴白娜」，覺民呌着她，可是她却逃跑了。　　當她們在紗廠見面的時候，巴白娜本來是立意不多講話的，但是人非木石，何况是多悄善感的她呢。每個星期，他們都會面。每一次見着他，巴白娜都說這是最後的一次，但是她却每一次都去。等到有一次他抱着她誠懇地向她說道：「巴白娜，你就是我的主宰，我的一切。」她明白他的確是了解她而愛她了。她快活地唱着歌，在嘉定林裏跑回家。她不願意嫁給公爵了。但是你件事不會這樣的簡單。巴白娜是受着村人們崎視的，而小牧師又有這麽多的村人監視着。她雖然知道有人常看見他們在一起，但她却不理會這對於他的名譽是有影響的。（未完）</p>

<h3 id="e1">Resolutions of the Central Political Council: Commendation for Meritorious Service in Closing the Breach, Convening a National Judicial Conference, and Approval for Fujian to Issue Two Types of Provincial Bonds <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central Political Council convened its 533rd meeting at 9:00 AM on the 17th, concerning prior conditions of the Fourth Water Conservancy Committee. Attendees included Wang Zhaoming, Sun Ke, Ye Chucang, Yu Youren, Lin Sen, Kong Xiangxi, Ma Chaojun, Chu Minyi, Zhu Jiahua, and over thirty others. The meeting was chaired by Ye Chucang, and the resolutions reached are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The closure of the breach in the Yellow River at Guantai should be investigated by the National Government to ascertain the meritorious service of Kong Xiangrong and other contributing personnel, who should be commended accordingly. Furthermore, the provincial governments along the river should be instructed to provide swift relief to the disaster victims.</p>
<p>(2) The request from the Judicial Yuan to convene a National Judicial Conference and the conference regulations were approved for record.</p>
<p>(3) The principles of the regulations for two types of bonds to be issued by the Fujian Provincial Government were approved with revisions and submitted to the Legislative Yuan for deliberation. These include a 3 million yuan local construction public bond for the 24th year of the Republic of China and a 5 million yuan bond for settling old debts.</p>
<p>(4) Wu Zhongxin was appointed as a member and chairman of the Guizhou Provincial Government. (Central News Agency dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The closure of the breach at the Guantai mouth of the Yellow River was completed on the morning of the 11th. Kong Xiangxi reported to the Central Political Council on the 17th regarding the difficult process of closure and dike construction. The original report was lengthy, detailing (1) the efforts to build dikes after the breach the year before last, (2) the reasons for the breach again after the closure of the Changyuan mouth last year, (3) the negligence and delays of the river work personnel of the Labor-Relief Group before its transfer to the Economic Commission, leading to a precarious situation,</p>
<p>(4) the Economic Commission's efforts to remedy the situation, resulting in a successful closure. The report was very detailed and stated that the harm of the Yellow River's water flow lies not only in its excessive volume but also in its excessive sediment content, which settles and shifts constantly. The downstream riverbed has been rising for years, causing poor drainage and more frequent breaches, making closure more difficult. He instructed Li Yizhi, the chairman of the Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission, to quickly repair and reinforce the Jin堤 (Jin Di) before the major flood season. He also telegraphed the Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission and the provincial governments of Hebei, Shandong, and Henan, noting that the dikes of the three provinces had been in disrepair for many years, and requested them to plan and cooperate on the repair and defense of the dikes in the three provinces as soon as possible. He also suggested inviting Chinese and foreign experts to conduct thorough research so that the Yellow River disaster could be reduced and the lives and property of those along the river could be protected. The report concluded by stating that a telegram had recently been received from the supervisory committee sent by the Control Yuan, stating that the closure at Guantai was excellent and that continued efforts were needed to increase its height and thickness to achieve complete success. The rapid closure was due to sufficient funding and unified authority, which resulted in twice the result with half the effort. Regarding the construction funds, Kong Xiangxi allocated 450,000 yuan after Director Kong Xiangrong took over the remedial project. After the project is completed, the director will be responsible for submitting the expenses for reimbursement to respect public funds. (Central News Agency dispatch, 17th)</p>

The committee was originally scheduled to be established for six months, but it is now rumored that it will be extended by three months to continue handling the clearing affairs in the war zone. The replacement of the newly formed security force has been delayed until the end of this month because the defense area has not been demarcated, the command authority has not been determined, and the headquarters of the first and second brigades have not yet found suitable housing. Zhang Yantian and Zhang Qingyu, the commanders of the security brigades, came to Beiping yesterday to meet with Yin Rugeng and then, accompanied by Yin, met with He to report on the inspection and downsizing of the security force. They also went to the Political Reorganization Council to meet with Wang Kemin. (Special dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Yin Rugeng stated that the new security force's entry into the war zone for replacement has not yet been properly arranged due to housing and transportation issues, and the departure date has not yet been determined. The allocation of police force in each county and the number of security forces stationed in each county will be determined after they enter the area. The old security team of Fan Jinghua has been transferred to the outskirts of Beiping for training and will return to the team after reorganization. Zhou Yuying's troops are currently stationed in Yutian to handle rural clearing. After the rural clearing is completed, they will be withdrawn. The reorganization of Li Yuansheng's troops stationed in the Yanjiao Xiadian area will be carried out as soon as the provincial government issues the reorganization funds. The establishment of a security command in the war zone has precedents in the southern provinces that can be followed. Yin will go south to negotiate this matter. He does not plan to leave Beiping recently. (Special dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Yin Rugeng canceled his trip to Tangshan and returned to Beiping from Tongxian on the 17th. (Special dispatch, 17th)</p>

Sun Yuchen and Liu Benzhi, the first and second battalion commanders of the unit, will downsize 450 men each, and they will start handling it immediately. (Special dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The new security force in the war zone was originally scheduled to depart for replacement on the 18th, but it has been decided to postpone it for several days due to insufficient preparation.

<h3 id="e9">Rampant Spread of Secret Societies in Various Counties of Southern Hebei, Inciting Salt Workers to Attempt Riots, Tax Police Still Stationed in Nanle County Seat <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>(Tianjin) In Nanle County, Southern Hebei, 12 branches of the Xingyi Dadao (Big Sword) Society gathered 4,000 people and surrounded the county seat, demanding that the tax police stationed in the Eighth District withdraw from the area. The tax police left the city in the afternoon and clashed with the members of the society, resulting in a fierce battle lasting three hours. One tax policeman was killed and two were injured, while three members of the society were killed and countless were injured. In Daming, Qingfeng, Qutong and other areas, secret societies such as the Red Spears and Yellow Sand societies took the opportunity to incite the salt workers and issue absurd leaflets, attempting to riot. The situation is extremely tense. On the afternoon of the 12th, Zhang Yongheng, the magistrate of Nanle County, Wang Haifeng, the magistrate of Qingfeng County, and gentry from Nanle negotiated and persuaded the members of the Big Sword Society and the tax police to temporarily cease hostilities. It was also mediated that the tax police would remain stationed in the Nanle county seat, and the salt workers would be temporarily allowed to scrape the leaching saltpeter. However, the secret societies and salt workers gathered in increasing numbers, agreeing to pay two yuan per salt worker to the secret societies for supplies, thoroughly resisting the tax police.

<p>(Tianjin) The Hebei County Party Headquarters telegraphed the Hebei Provincial Party Headquarters to report that there are over 70 counties in Southern Hebei that produce leaching saltpeter. Due to the infertile land and the unsuitability for cultivation, hundreds of thousands of people rely on leaching saltpeter for their livelihood. If it is completely banned, millions of people will have no way to make a living, and the barren land will be turned into wasteland. It is expected that they will take risks and cause incidents. The Party Headquarters also suggested six measures: establishing a loan institution for the people to enable them to change their profession and provide spring farming assistance, establishing agricultural loan societies, exempting taxes, and requesting the Changlu salt transport envoy to handle the matter.

<h3 id="e24">Dumping of Foreign Cigarettes and the Domestic Cigarette Industry <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>— Yan</p>
<p>Since the cigarette consolidated tax was changed to a two-tier tax system, the domestic Chinese cigarette industry has had to compete among themselves because of the heavy tax rates, coupled with the bankruptcy of the rural areas and the reduction in purchasing power. On the one hand, they have tried to reduce prices to attract customers. On the other hand, they have also included huge bonuses and gifts (the so-called "gift cigarettes") to entice customers. Their willingness to make a desperate bet is nothing more than to seek self-preservation and to strive to survive with all their might. However, since the popularity of this "gift cigarette," the sales of domestic cigarettes have indeed increased sharply. However, in terms of sales volume, the total sales for the whole year last year were only more than 400,000 cases, only half of what it was in previous years. Therefore, most manufacturers have found that profits are meager and losses are huge. Those who can obtain slightly better business records are few and far between.</p>
<p>Now, since March of this year, the production of "gift cigarettes" has been banned. Moreover, starting next month, the sale of these "gift cigarettes" will also be prohibited. Since the order was issued, the sales of domestic cigarettes have plummeted and prices have fallen sharply. At the same time, the cigarettes of British and American companies have taken the opportunity to dump their products on the market. According to statistics, the output of British and American tobacco companies was only more than 10,000 cases per month in the least prosperous times. In recent months, sales have increased by approximately 36,000 cases per month. It is estimated that monthly sales will reach a huge 50,000 cases. Moreover, their selling prices have been drastically reduced in order to compete. For example, the "Little Fairy" brand used to sell for more than 160 yuan per case, but now it only sells for 142 yuan. Moreover, each empty pack can be exchanged for one cigarette, which requires a reduction of approximately 14 yuan. That is, each case is actually sold for 128 yuan. After deducting the consolidated tax of 80 yuan, there are still 48 yuan left. After deducting the cost of raw materials, wages, discounts, and commissions, it is actually feared that it is not enough to cover the cost. Such competition is hardly easy for our Chinese cigarette industry, which has weak capital, to resist.</p>
<p>The reason why British and American tobacco companies are making huge sacrifices and eagerly taking this action is nothing more than relying on their strong capital to overwhelm the Chinese cigarette industry in order to dominate the Chinese market forever. Therefore, starting on November 1, last year, they specially reorganized the original British-owned British American Tobacco Company in China, the British Great Britain Tobacco Company, and the British Ho Tai Tobacco Co., Ltd. into the British Yizhong Tobacco Co., Ltd. and the British Yizhong Tobacco Sales Co., Ltd. The purpose of the reorganization is to increase efficiency in their business operations and to achieve the effect of division of labor and cooperation in production and sales. Recently, the rights of the Greater American Tobacco Company's manager in China have also been acquired by the company. Their power will become increasingly inflated, and the domestic cigarette industry will be even more seriously affected.</p>
<p>Moreover, British and American tobacco companies not only use their strong capital to oppress our domestic manufacturers, but also use other means to cause various intangible damages to our domestic manufacturers. Fortunately, whenever domestic manufacturers encounter foreign oppression, they often adopt conservative policies to temporarily avoid their edge. Once the oppression is slightly relaxed, they rise up again. Therefore, although they have suffered various difficulties for more than ten years, a small number of manufacturers have still been able to support themselves. However, the number of those who have sacrificed in this process is unknown. Recently, we have once again witnessed the domestic cigarette industry in a difficult situation, unable to recover on its own, and we cannot help but feel deeply moved. We sincerely hope that the government authorities will understand the difficulties of business and the importance of supporting our national industry, and on the one hand, find ways to curb unfair competition from foreign merchants, and on the other hand, provide our domestic manufacturers with considerable assistance and convenience so that the vitality of our domestic cigarette industry will not be completely destroyed by the various strategies of foreign merchants competing against us.</p>
<h3 id="e25">France, England, Italy's Proposal Regarding Germany Passed by the League of Nations Council; Denmark Alone Did Not Vote; Legal Experts Committee Appointed to Study Future Sanctions <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>(Geneva) Today, the League of Nations Council enthusiastically passed the resolution proposed by France, England, and Italy condemning Germany's violation of the military clauses of the Treaty of Versailles. Denmark alone did not vote. This ends Germany's hopes of rejoining the League of Nations, and it will increasingly pursue a path of acting unilaterally. However, the resolution of the three countries maintains a peaceful tone and has clear provisions for continued negotiations, so observers still believe that the situation is delicate and there is still room for maneuver. The League of Nations Council meeting today adjourned at 1:25 PM, but will reconvene at 4:30 PM to appoint a committee of legal experts to study economic and financial sanctions to punish those who violate treaties in the future. (National Telegram, 17th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Today, the League of Nations Council met in a tense atmosphere. French Foreign Minister Laval, on behalf of the governments of Britain, Italy, and France, presented a resolution condemning Germany's violation of the military clauses of the Treaty of Versailles and requesting the League of Nations to exercise its autonomous fairness and authority. British Foreign Secretary Simon and Italian representative Aloisi successively spoke in support of France. The meeting was adjourned until tomorrow. The Danish representative said that he must consult with his government and will only be able to express his opinion tomorrow. It is expected that the resolution will be passed without amendment.</p>
<p>Today's Council meeting was the first since Japan withdrew from the League of Nations. Japan's seat had been vacant for two years and has now been removed. Soviet Russian Foreign Commissar Litvinov was already seated to the left of British Foreign Secretary Simon. When French Foreign Minister Laval presented the resolution, he stated that Germany's unilateral implementation of compulsory military service on March 16 must be condemned. We must now find ways to make the League of Nations Covenant more effective in the collective security organization. The Council is entrusted with maintaining peace and must fulfill its responsibility. France has shown its willingness to pursue peace through its actions. The negotiations that began in London on February 3 have been undermined by Germany's actions. France's policy is not to antagonize any country; the security that France seeks is to be extended to all countries.</p>
<p>Simon spoke after Laval, clarifying that the main aim of the policy outlined in the resolution is to establish collective maintenance of peace within the League of Nations framework and asked everyone to pass this resolution to prove that the League of Nations is united for the principles on which it was founded. If this resolution is passed, the door to universal compromise will remain open.</p>
<p>Aloisi spoke, saying that Italy has always advocated revising the military clauses of the Treaty of Versailles, but it must be done legally through negotiations.</p>
<p>Polish representative Beck asked whether new sanctions would be proposed to increase the authority of the League of Nations. Polish public opinion is now very concerned that the proposed new coordination may damage the state of peace in northeastern Europe created by Poland concluding the agreement. (Reuters, 16th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) According to informed sources, the League of Nations Council may close today, as Foreign Secretary Simon has indicated that he will leave Geneva this evening no matter what. All parties believe that the draft resolution proposed yesterday will not be amended. If there are any amendments, they will be included in an addendum. (National Telegram, 17th)</p>
<h3 id="e26">Full Text of the Resolution: Unilateral Abrogation of Treaties Harms International Security; Realistic Negotiations and Future Sanctions <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>(Geneva) The full text of the draft resolution submitted by French Foreign Minister Laval to the League of Nations Council on behalf of France, Britain, and Italy is as follows:</p>
<p>According to the opinion of the League of Nations Council:</p>
<p>1.  Compliance with all treaty obligations is the fundamental rule of international life and an important condition for maintaining peace.</p>
<p>2.  A major principle of human rights is that no country may, without the permission of other contracting parties, abolish obligations in a treaty or change its provisions.</p>
<p>3.  The German Defense Law passed on March 16, 1935, is in conflict with these principles.</p>
<p>4.  Such unilateral action can never acquire rights.</p>
<p>5.  Such unilateral action adds a new source of international chaos and will threaten the security of Europe.</p>
<p>6.  Britain and France, with the consent of Italy, have been negotiating with Germany since February 3, 1935, to seek security for all of Europe and to establish universal disarmament based on the principle of Germany's active participation in the League of Nations.</p>
<p>7.  Germany's unilateral action is not only inconsistent with this plan, but also occurs precisely when negotiations are underway.</p>
<p>Based on these facts, the League of Nations Council declares:</p>
<p>1.  Germany's failure to comply with the treaty has undermined the obligations that the entire international community should bear. The Council condemns such unilateral abrogation of international obligations.</p>
<p>2.  The Council requests that the governments that drafted and signed the plan of February 3, 1935, continue these negotiations that have already begun and seek their success within the scope of the League of Nations, and strive to achieve the goals of security, tranquility, and peace.</p>
<p>3.  Since the unilateral abrogation of international obligations endangers the existence of the League of Nations, and since the League of Nations' mission is to maintain peace, the Council resolves that such unilateral abrogation of treaties must be subject to the implementation of various necessary measures to protect the security of the people of all countries and European peace. The Council therefore entrusts a committee to propose ways for the League of Nations to maintain peace and to stipulate what special economic and financial measures the League of Nations should take in the future when a member state or non-member state of the League of Nations unilaterally disrupts peace.

<h3 id="e27">Statement of the Danish Representative <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>(Geneva) Danish representative Munch stated that he agreed with the constructive parts of the resolution proposed by the French Foreign Minister, but did not agree with condemning the already past violations of the Treaty of Versailles, because once condemned, the work of reconciliation would be hindered, so he did not want to vote. (Reuters, 17th)</p>

<p>(Geneva) Just as the Council was about to vote, Litvinov suddenly raised an important reservation of Soviet Russia regarding the French resolution, stating that although Soviet Russia voted in favor of the proposal, it advocated that the condemnation of the unilateral abrogation of treaty obligations should be applied to other continents as well, and should be the same as for Europe. These remarks were clearly directed at Japan's actions in the Far East. For a moment, the representatives of the other powers were all uneasy. British Foreign Secretary Simon immediately asked Litvinov to withdraw his reservation, and Laval and Aloisi also spoke in favor of this. Litvinov finally withdrew at everyone's request, and then the crowd laughed and were relieved.</p>
<p>Today, the Turkish representative suddenly unexpectedly raised the issue of the Dardanelles Strait in the meeting, stating that in the event of any changes to the current situation stipulated in the Treaty of Neuilly, Turkey would have to demand that the military clauses of the treaty regarding the Dardanelles Strait be revised in order to protect Turkey's natural defense line and enjoy equal treatment. Simon immediately stood up and replied, "At present, all I can say is that I will make all reservations." Aloisi and Laval both agreed with Simon's proposal, while Litvinov said that he had no objection to Turkey's aspirations. (Reuters, 17th)</p>

<p>(The League of Nations Council meeting in Geneva opened at 11:30 this morning to continue discussions on Germany's violation of the treaty by rearming. As a result of the discussion, the draft resolution of France, Britain, and Italy was unanimously passed by the representatives of the thirteen countries attending the Council: Britain, France, Italy, Russia, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Portugal, Spain, Turkey, Chile, Argentina, Australia, and Mexico. Only Denmark abstained. This morning's meeting was still chaired by Turkish Foreign Minister Rüştü. The representatives of the countries that had not expressed their positions at yesterday's meeting had all received instructions from their respective governments today. The first speaker was Soviet Russian Foreign Commissar Litvinov, who stated that "Germany's notification of withdrawal from the League of Nations has not yet reached the two-year deadline, so it is still a member of the League of Nations. The decision taken by the German government on March 16 violates international treaties. The Soviet government believes that all countries should have equal rights to protect their national security, but the establishment of military equipment should be conditional on being solely for defense purposes. Although Russia did not sign the Treaty of Versailles, it deeply desires to create an international order to prevent any actions that violate treaties." Portuguese representative de Mello Franco then spoke, supporting the draft resolution, saying that "if actions that violate treaties can only be morally condemned, then international order will not be able to progress. Countries that violate treaties should be excluded from the international community. As for countries that have withdrawn from the League of Nations, it is our wish that they can rejoin the League of Nations, but it should be conditional on participating in collective security organizations." Next, Australian representative Bruce spoke, also expressing his support for the draft resolution, hoping that it would be unanimously passed by the Council, and saying that if the League of Nations' actions were to fail, then the member states would only have to take their own steps to ensure security. Spanish representative Madariaga then spoke, saying that "the Council must have moral strength, and the Spanish government will vote in favor of the draft resolution, as it believes that law is more important than power." The representatives of Mexico, Argentina, and Chile spoke one after another, with the same general idea, advocating for unconditional acceptance of the draft resolution. However, Danish representative Munch said, "The Danish government agrees with the various parts of the draft resolution that are not related to Germany, but is deeply afraid that the policy of judging Germany may hinder the success of future negotiations. If the three countries that participated in the Stresa Conference, Britain, France, and Italy, are willing to change the wording of the resolution, then the Danish government is willing to cast a vote in favor; otherwise, the Danish government will abstain." At that point, Turkish Foreign Minister Rüştü temporarily relinquished his position as chairman and spoke in his capacity as the Turkish government representative, raising the issue of the demilitarization of the Dardanelles Strait, but stated that this issue would not be discussed at today's meeting. British Foreign Secretary Simon then spoke, making all reservations regarding this issue of Turkey. French Foreign Minister Laval then explained on behalf of Turkey, saying that the Turkish government did not explicitly raise this issue, but only expressed Turkey's desire to join the future collective security system in the Balkans. Soviet Russian Foreign Commissar Litvinov then declared that there would be no difficulty in realizing this wish of Turkey. At that point, the draft resolution was put to a vote and unanimously passed. The Council meeting was adjourned at 1:00 PM. (Havas, 17th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Spanish representative said that he could not abstain from voting in favor of guaranteeing that justice prevails over might. Australian representative Bruce said that general public opinion believes that the world's peace status has already deteriorated, and Australians are particularly uneasy about this. The fear of security has now been crystallized by Germany's unilateral actions, forcing them to deal with the crisis. He believes that the Council's unanimous vote in favor will build a road for cooperation with European countries within the League of Nations and formulate an agreement to guarantee world peace and security. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) This afternoon, the League of Nations Council met, and the representatives of France, Britain, and Italy jointly presented a draft resolution opposing Germany's unilateral abrogation of the treaty and rearmament. The representatives of the countries attending the Council then expressed their opinions one after another. A detailed record of the debate is as follows: When the Council meeting opened this afternoon, French Foreign Minister Laval immediately read a declaration requesting the Council to oppose the German government's decision on March 16, stating that "the Council has a responsibility to maintain peace, and at this time, it is not appropriate to be content with silence or ignore it. The people of all countries know that respecting oaths and keeping the commitments already made are not only a moral principle, but also the golden rule upon which the League of Nations relies for its survival. The countries are following the London Declaration of February 3 and conducting negotiations on the security organization. Germany suddenly announced its rearmament, which makes all negotiations a waste of effort, and people around the world are disappointed and uneasy about it. We do not have any differences of opinion between countries, and all nations should be treated equally. Our policy is not to oppose any other country. The security we demand is not solely for our own purposes, but is intended to make all countries secure. Therefore, although France is submitting this application today, it has never abandoned its commitment to peace. The French government will never hinder any undertakings necessary to achieve understanding among nations. In order to satisfy the requirements of international morality, if adjudicating past events is helpful to overcoming difficulties, then at the same time, the work of the peace organization must never be interrupted, as the work of the peace organization is difficult, circuitous, and difficult to achieve quickly."</p>
<p>After Laval finished his speech, British Foreign Secretary Simon spoke, stating that "the British government, together with the governments of France and Italy, has jointly presented a draft resolution, hoping that this draft will be unanimously passed by the Council. As for the reasons why the three countries, Britain, France, and Italy, have presented this draft resolution, it is based on the final declaration of the Stresa Conference. According to this declaration, the governments of Britain, France, and Italy have decided that when there is a unilateral abrogation of treaty obligations that is sufficient to undermine peace, various methods should be adopted to deal with it jointly. The draft resolution submitted to the Council this time is to expand this obligation of Britain, France, and Italy, and have all member states participate in it. Although this draft resolution is produced by the treaty-breaking action of one country, we can apply it to all countries to achieve the benefits of maintaining peace, and the various items recommended in the draft resolution do not block the door to future negotiations."</p>
<p>Next, Italian representative Aloisi delivered a declaration, stating that "Italy's policy is based on recognizing the actual situation and recognizing the rights and interests of all countries, but anything that is sufficient to undermine European security and peace, such as the unilateral abrogation of the Treaty of Versailles, cannot be supported by Italy. Italy expresses its agreement with the opinions expressed by the representatives of Britain and France. Italy believes that the treaty can be amended, but it must be done through legal channels."</p>
<p>At that point, Polish Foreign Minister Beck spoke, stating that "the Polish government has reservations regarding the following items: (1) the draft resolution on opposing Germany's rearmament; (2) the proposal to strengthen the actions of the League of Nations in the event of any future events that violate treaty obligations, as the Polish government is not inclined to believe in increasing the clauses of the League of Nations Covenant, increasing the constraints on the member states, and enhancing the authority of the Covenant to make the League of Nations more effective; (3) the proposal to conclude another treaty to increase security." Beck also said, "Poland has separately concluded non-aggression treaties with its two neighboring countries, Russia and Germany, making Poland's international relations stable. Now, some people have repeatedly requested finding ways to seek peace in Eastern Europe, so Polish public opinion is unsettled, and Polish public opinion is deeply concerned that the state of peace established by sincere and faithful policies may be damaged by the various proposed new agreements."</p>
<p>Czech Foreign Minister Beneš followed Beck with a speech, generally saying that the Czech government supported the draft resolution presented by Britain, France, and Italy. Spanish representative Madariaga said, "The issue presented today and the procedures adopted are of an extraordinary nature, so it is advocated that the freedom of the Council to discuss this issue should be respected, and if necessary, it should be free to amend the draft resolution." Finally, Danish representative Munch spoke, saying that "the Danish representative expressed agreement with some points in the draft resolution, but requested consultation with his home government before expressing his opinion." At that point, the Council meeting was adjourned and scheduled to continue the discussion at the meeting tomorrow morning. (Havas, 16th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) The Berlin semi-official side released the following message after Polish Foreign Minister Beck made a strong statement in the League of Nations Council: (1) Poland has expressed its attitude towards Germany's rearmament and does not want to express it again. (2) Poland believes that the matter of expanding the responsibilities of the member states of the League of Nations is not within the authority of the Council and should be resolved by the General Assembly. (3) Poland's foreign policy is different from the construction of itself and the policies of Western Europe. Poland's policy takes the maintenance of peace in Eastern Europe as an element. For this reason, Poland has separately established non-aggression pacts with Soviet Russia and Germany. Polish public opinion is deeply concerned that the agreements currently planned may hinder peace in Eastern Europe. All parties attach great importance to the words of Foreign Minister Beck, believing that they represent Poland's attitude towards Europe. (National Telegram, 17th)</p>

<h3 id="e30">Germany Issues Warning: If the Three-Nation Resolution Is Passed, Germany Will Never Return to the League of Nations <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>(Berlin) If the countries of the world adopt the resolutions of the Stresa Conference, then Germany under the rule of the National Socialist Party will never return to the League of Nations. The German government will take an independent attitude, that is, if Germany is discriminated against by other countries, it must have greater military power. This warning was issued by a spokesman for German leader Hitler. As for France's attitude, it is also to be expected, as the French authorities do not hope for the cooperation of the National Socialist Party leader. French Foreign Minister Laval once said that it is Germany, not France, that is being judged by the countries of the world. Germany's blatant violation of the Treaty of Versailles cannot be tolerated by the signatory countries, especially the states neighboring Germany must oppose it. A French spokesman said that France will continue to increase its land and air military strength in order to have sufficient "self-defense" power to prepare for war. Fair observers predict that this action by France will cause an unlimited arms race, because if Germany and France increase their military power, then other countries will also rise up and follow suit, competing for self-defense. If this continues, it will inevitably lead to a situation that is difficult to reverse. (National Telegram, 17th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) The German newspapers this morning unanimously refuted the three-nation proposal submitted to the League of Nations Council yesterday condemning Germany's rearmament, believing that if this proposal is passed, the organization of peace in Europe will be seriously harmed. If the League of Nations arrogantly believes that it has the right to arbitrarily judge defeated Germany, then it will be difficult for Germany to return to the League of Nations. The Berlin Morning Post stated that this proposal is a crime that endangers European peace and will close the door to negotiations with Germany. The Berlin Daily News stated that the three countries not only regard themselves as prosecutors, but also as judges, wanting to determine that Germany is guilty. This kind of action cannot be without serious consequences. (Reuters, 17th)</p>

<p>(Paris) French and German diplomats may soon be able to resolve their deep-seated centuries-old hatred at the conference table, surrounded by cigar ash. French Foreign Minister Laval and German leader Hitler have long planned to meet, but the situation has become bleak again due to the re-emergence of open conflict in Geneva. However, according to international observers today, it is almost certain that the French Foreign Minister will get off the train and linger in Berlin on his way back from Russia. The meeting between Laval and Hitler will of course be of an informal nature, and the two will only sit with other leaders of the National Socialist Party and talk about all kinds of disputes that could cause a European war. Britain and Italy have no expectations for the Franco-German leaders' meeting, as they believe that there is little chance of a genuine compromise between the two countries. The recent failed talks between Hitler and British Foreign Secretary Simon can serve as a warning. Some people even believe that Hitler's provocative attitude may deepen the resentment between the two countries, and the opportunity for resentment to arise is even greater if he talks about whether the German air force is now equal to Britain's or whether it will be equal to Britain's in the future. France is the country that openly opposes Germany's rearmament most strongly and advocates economic sanctions to punish Germany in the League of Nations. In other words, the meeting between Laval and Hitler is nothing more than an irresistible force encountering an unbreakable material. (National Telegram, 17th)</p>

<p>(Paris) According to the comparison of military strength of various countries by European military experts, the German army will rank second, and its navy and air force will rank third.

<p>(London) British Prime Minister MacDonald reported to the House of Commons today on the results of the Stresa Conference, saying that we have not forgiven Germany's action of reintroducing compulsory military service, and we have declared that we regard this as a major cause of unrest and a blow to the international peace organization. He continued that Britain has always paid close and friendly attention to the Eastern European Convention and the issue of Austrian independence, but Britain has not undertaken new restrictions and will only consult with other countries when Austrian integrity and independence are endangered. The three countries, Britain, France, and Italy, have agreed to actively study the Western European Air Convention. Italy and Britain have clarified their obligations under the Locarno Treaty. MacDonald mentioned Germany's reintroduction of compulsory military service and said that we have always opened the door to allow Germany to join the movement to create a European collective security system. Our policy will still be based on the League of Nations Covenant. The three countries that participated in the Stresa Conference do not go their separate ways, but will work together as one to find a peaceful solution to today's crisis and cooperate with countries that are willing to join this work.

<h3 id="e41">German Trade Surplus <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>(Berlin) In March of this year, Germany's foreign trade had a surplus of 12 million marks over imports. This is the first time since last November that there has been such a surplus. The figures released today clearly show that the result of this surplus is encouraging for the future. Several months ago, a large amount of raw materials was imported after many agreements were made with foreign countries to barter goods for goods, and now they can be manufactured and re-exported as raw material exchanges. This observation is based on facts. The amount of imports in March was 353 million marks, lower than the 259 million in February. As for the amount of exports in March, it was 365 million marks, which is a significant increase from the 302 million in February. From this, it can be said that the export trade volume has almost completely improved suddenly. In March 1934, the import amount was 398 million, and the export amount in the same month was 401 million. Therefore, last year's foreign trade was too low. However, compared with the monthly average for the whole year of 1934, the 353 (million marks) in March 1935 has fallen from the average of 371 (million marks). On the contrary, the average export volume in 1934 was 347 (million marks), and in March of the third year of 1935, it rose to 365 (million marks). This proves its actual progress. However, in practice, these two figures still need to be corrected to some extent, because in March 1935, Saar was included in Germany for the first time, and its imports and exports will naturally increase compared to before its return. However, the most relevant figure in Germany's foreign trade at present is the display of its economic and financial probable ability in the world market. This kind of distinction is only a matter of routine relationship. The noteworthy items in the imports in March are the increase in the purchase of wool by 5.2 million marks, timber by 2.2, rubber by 1.9, and mineral oil by 0.6 million marks. These are the raw materials needed for Germany's economic recovery. In addition to Europe, the cotton and metal industries in the United States and the cotton industry in Egypt have increased. The import of Australian wool and Turkish textile raw materials has decreased. (National Press, 16th)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) It is reported that the British government has decided to hold technical preliminary negotiations with the Soviet Union and Germany in parallel with the disarmament conference to be held this year. The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs has not received any official telegrams. However, the general opinion within the ministry is as follows: (1) The formal arms conference to be held this year is based on the provisions of the Washington Treaty and the London Treaty. Therefore, the participating countries are naturally limited to the five countries of Britain, the United States, France, Italy, and Japan. If the Soviet Union and Germany participate, the disarmament conference will inevitably lead to the same results as the League of Nations general disarmament conference, making the conference even more ineffective. (2) When Germany declared its rearmament last time, the French ambassador to Japan visited Foreign Minister Hirota and requested the participation of the Soviet Union and Germany in the disarmament conference. Foreign Minister Hirota tactfully expressed his opposition at the time, saying that if the Soviet Union and Germany participated, it should be another conference with the Washington Treaty disarmament conference. The empire still adheres to this policy and has not changed in any way. (3) The Empire's government cannot express its satisfaction with turning the arms reduction conference, which focuses on international peace, into a tool for discussing the maintenance of European peace institutions. (Telegraphic News Agency, 17th)</p>
<p>(London) The Times quoted a Geneva visiting reporter as saying that the naval negotiations between Britain and Germany are proceeding smoothly and that a conference will be convened in London to discuss the issue of German naval rearmament. According to previous talks between British and German cabinet members in Berlin, Chancellor Hitler requested that Britain allow Germany to build a navy to one-third of the total tonnage of the British navy. However, the scope of activities of the German fleet is only the North Sea and the Baltic Sea. The British navy must be distributed in the seven seas. By analogy, the German warships are all newly built and have great power. Although it is not necessary to be above the British navy in the vicinity of British territorial waters, it can at least be equal to it. (Havas, 17th)</p>

<p>(Washington) Sandstorms are raging, drought is occurring, and the cotton processing tax is unpopular. It is puzzling how the authorities will formulate their future agricultural policies in this situation. Secretary of Agriculture Wallace's recent submission of amendments to the Agricultural Adjustment Act has aroused dissatisfaction in Congress. Therefore, the Secretary of Agriculture is now the center of controversy. At the same time, several New England cotton mills have closed their doors to protest the processing tax. The number of strikers has now reached 4,500. The decline in the business of cotton mills is also due to the import of Japanese cotton textiles. The issue of Japanese imports is now a major concern for the textile industry. A delegation of congressmen with the signatures of 100 members will visit President Roosevelt on Friday to state the current situation of domestic textile mills and request that he suppress the excessive import of Japanese textiles. President Roosevelt recently said that the import of Japanese cotton textiles into the United States is only one percent of the US production. This statement has been criticized by cotton cloth manufacturers, who believe that what is currently disrupting the market is not the amount of imports, but the reduction of foreign goods prices.

<p>(Xuzhou) Xiao County is proceeding with the land reporting very quickly. Unexpectedly, Limin Township in the northeast fourth district of Xiao County, located in the old course of the Yellow River, has many shoal fields. The Red Spear Society instigated people from within, and the masses gathered thousands of people to resist. On the evening of the 16th, they surrounded the Huangkou Fourth District Office and destroyed the Yangzhuang Limin Township Office. The Xiao County government sent a public security team to suppress and telegraphed the Tong District Commissioner's Office to transfer the Tongshan Public Security Brigade to assist overnight. At dawn on the 17th, they surrounded the crowd in Zhangzhuang. The crowd relied on the barricade and fired guns to resist. The Xiao and Tong public security teams then launched an attack, resulting in several casualties. The crowd could not hold on and fled to the old embankment of the Yellow River and surrendered their weapons separately.

A consortium of creditor banks is lending 2 million yuan in working capital and sending people to manage it, collecting monthly interest and repaying debts with the surplus.

The Economic Commission is sending a commissioner from the Cotton Industry Control Association to Tianjin to assess the value and auction off the assets to offset the debt. Another new company will take over the factory's assets and resume operations. The East Asia Development Company is making every effort to buy out the Tianjin yarn factory or operate it under a trusteeship, in order to fulfill its ambition to control the yarn industry in North China.

Each package of fine yarn produced results in a loss of 10 yuan, and they are all in a state of unsustainability. (Special dispatch from the 17th)</p>

<p>Since the Ban Hong incident occurred last spring, the Chinese and British sides have had differing opinions. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs believes that the crux of the case lies in the undetermined boundary line in the southern section of the Yunnan-Burma border and has discussed the matter with the British Ambassador, forming a joint commission to re-survey the old border. After several discussions, two notes were exchanged on the 9th of this month. The original text was released yesterday (the 17th) as follows:</p>
<p>First Note from the British Ambassador (Translation)</p>
<p>"Regarding the undetermined boundary problem in the southern section of the Yunnan-Burma border referred to in Sections 3 and 4 of the Supplementary Convention to the Anglo-Chinese Convention Regarding Burma, signed in Beijing on February 4, 1897, the two parties have recently consulted on a solution. The Ambassador hereby declares that the British Government and the Indian Government accept the following terms of reference regarding the establishment and authority of the Border Commission mandated to investigate the said undetermined border section: (1) The Government of the Republic of China, on the one hand, and the Government of Great Britain and the Government of India, on the other hand, being now desirous of settling the long-pending question of the Yunnan-Burma border southern section and being motivated by a true spirit of compromise and mutual concession, hereby agree to establish a joint border commission composed of five members, with each side appointing two members, and with the Chairman of the Council of the League of Nations selecting one neutral member, who shall be the Chairman of the Commission. In the event that the opinions of other members differ and are equal in number, the chairman shall have the final vote. (2) The first responsibility of the Commission shall be to determine in the field the boundary line stipulated in Sections 3 and 4 of Article 3 of the 1897 Treaty relating to the undetermined border and to plot it on a map. When interpreting the text of the treaty that has not been given the same interpretation by the respective governments, the Commission shall give due consideration to the points stipulated and specified in the above-mentioned sections of the treaty, namely the intersections, watersheds, and place names contained in the text. (3) The second responsibility of the Commission shall be as follows: If any issues arise that they believe, based on mutual concession, should be subject to partial modification of the agreed boundary line, as specified in Article 6 of the original treaty, the Commission shall report to the respective governments for consideration based on their field inspections. (4) The Chinese and British members may, if they deem it necessary, provide their individual views for consideration by the respective governments. The Ambassador hereby requests Your Minister to confirm that the Government of the Republic of China also accepts the above-mentioned terms of reference. This note is hereby sent to Your Minister for review and response. Dated the 9th day of April, 1935."</p>
<p>First Reply Note from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs: "Regarding the reply, I acknowledge receipt of Your Excellency's note of today stating (repeating the original text of the note) and etc. With regard to the Border Commission mandated to investigate the undetermined border section in the southern section of the Yunnan-Burma border, the Minister hereby declares that the Government of the Republic of China also accepts the above-mentioned terms of reference regarding the establishment and authority of the Commission. This note is hereby sent to Your Excellency for review and response. Dated the ninth day of April in the twenty-fourth year of the Republic of China."</p>
<p>Second Note from the British Ambassador (Translation): "Regarding the establishment and authority of the Border Commission to investigate the undetermined border section in the southern section of the Yunnan-Burma border, as per the documents exchanged between our two parties today, the Ambassador hereby certifies, on behalf of the British Government and the Indian Government, that our respective governments have further understandings for negotiating a recommended solution for the said undetermined border section as follows: Based on the Commission's report, or based on geographical, historical, or political factors seemingly related to this issue, any future modification issues shall be discussed by both parties in a spirit of compromise and mutual concession. For the purpose of conducting these future negotiations, a conference shall be convened in Nanjing, if necessary, bringing together representatives from the respective governments, including representatives from Yunnan and Burma. The conclusions of the Commission's report and the results of any subsequent negotiations shall be stipulated in a new agreement. Prior to the signing of this new agreement, the respective governments shall each retain their original positions on this border section issue. The Ambassador hereby requests Your Minister, on behalf of the Government of the Republic of China, to certify the aforementioned additional understandings regarding this negotiation. This note is hereby sent to Your Minister for review and response. Dated the 9th day of April, 1935."</p>
<p>Second Reply Note from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs: "Regarding the reply, I acknowledge receipt of Your Excellency's note of today stating (repeating the original text of the note) and etc. The Minister hereby certifies the above-mentioned understanding on behalf of the Government of the Republic of China.

<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: You Lie, courtesy name Shaowan, a revolutionary pioneer, is now 71 years old. He is a native of Shunde, Guangdong. In his early years, he traveled and engaged in revolutionary activities. Together with Sun Yat-sen, Yang Quyun, Yang Heling, Chen Shaobai, Lu Haodong, Cheng Yaozhen, Zheng Shiliang, and others, he founded the Revive China Society. Later, he founded the Revolutionary Alliance, with Sun Yat-sen as the president, and Mr. You presided over affairs in Southeast Asia. In the early days of the revolution, Sun, You, Yang (Heling), and Chen (Shaobai) were known as the "Four Great Bandits." After the founding of the Republic of China, You retired after his success and traveled to various countries in Europe and America. Recently, due to old age, he retired to Hong Kong, devoting himself to the study of Confucian classics and medical books. He has written books such as "Confucius's Theory of Revolution" and "Annotations to the Four Books." He also practices medicine in Hong Kong. Mr. You dedicated himself to the party and the country and did not have time to care for his family. His parents and wife passed away one after another long ago. Now he is all alone and living in extreme poverty. Xiao Focheng, Zou Lu, Li Xiangen, Zhong Rongguang, Song Juren, Li Jitang, Huang Mingtang, and others, believing that Mr. You is old and virtuous, and is the beacon of the revolutionary pioneers, have joined forces with the old comrades of the former Revive China Society and the members of the Revolutionary Memorial Society, as Mr. You is now celebrating his seventy-first birthday. They have specially organized the You Family Longevity Celebration Preparatory Committee in Hong Kong, and have designated the 29th of this month to celebrate Mr. You's birthday. Important figures from the party and the country, as well as Mr. You's relatives and friends, are all participating. Preparations have now begun, and notices have been sent out to solicit articles from various celebrities. Furthermore, Feng Ziyou, an old comrade of the Revolutionary Alliance, sent a congratulatory couplet to You, saying, "During the revival of the Han Dynasty, who remembers the fisherman Yan Chushi? At the Xiangshan Conference, we all worshiped Lord Guo Linggong on his lone ride."</p>

<p>Shantou Correspondence: Xiao Focheng, Central Committee Member and Standing Committee Member of the Southwest Political Council, grew up in Siam and regards Siam almost as his hometown. Xiao, feeling that he is old and suffering from a cough, repeatedly wanted to return to Siam for recuperation last winter when it was cold, but he did not go because he was unwilling to leave his political career. Xiao has two sons. The elder son, Song Jian, is in Guangzhou serving him and also holding a position on the Power Commission. The younger son, Song Qin, is the supervisor of the Chao Hai Customs. Song Qin left Shantou for Guangzhou the day before yesterday. According to sources from the Customs Supervision Office, Xiao has booked two first-class cabins on the Taikoo Shipping Company's Jiangsu ship to Siam, accompanied by Song Jian. He is scheduled to arrive in Hong Kong on the 14th and can pass through Shantou on the 15th. He is expected to go directly to Siam from Shantou. Song Qin went to Guangzhou to see his father and brother off.</p>
<p>Approximately 60,000 overseas Chinese have returned to Shantou from Siam this spring. Among them are representatives of Siamese business groups. It is said that there are no less than 600,000 overseas Chinese residing in Bangkok. After the establishment of the new government, they consult with strong neighbors on everything and oppress overseas Chinese. They have increased ten types of taxes, such as goods tax, population tax, landing tax, residence tax, and pawnshop tax. They also intend to increase the landing tax again, from 150 baht per person to 200 baht. Income tax and inheritance tax are also being planned. They also forcibly implement assimilation education. Overseas Chinese girls, from the ages of seven to fourteen, must attend Siamese schools. Overseas Chinese teachers and curricula are greatly restricted. They are only allowed to study Chinese for one hour each day. Twenty-four overseas Chinese schools have been closed down. Since China and Siam have not signed a commercial treaty, the 1.5 million overseas Chinese in Siam are suffering from the unfair treatment of a country without a treaty. Siam's exports are mainly rice and timber. Its rice relies entirely on Hong Kong, Guangzhou, Shantou, and other places for sales. If the import of Siamese rice is banned, Siam's economy will be hit, which will surely prompt the Siamese government to come to its senses.</p>

<p>Annual Meeting of Foreign Taxpayers</p>
<p>Passed a Motion to Postpone Telephone Rate Increase</p>
<p>Japanese Residents Vigorously Argued, Meeting Atmosphere Became Highly Agitated</p>
<p>A Special Committee Was Organized to Study and Handle It</p>
<p>Motions to Dismiss the Orchestra and Levy Taxes on Vacant Land Were Rejected</p>
<p>The annual meeting of foreign taxpayers in the Shanghai Public Concession was held yesterday afternoon at 5:00 PM at the Grand Theater on Jing'an Temple Road. A total of 897 people attended, with Japanese residents accounting for more than half. The meeting adjourned at approximately 8:00 PM. All eleven motions were discussed. During the final discussion, when Mr. Kanematsu and others from the Japanese residents proposed that the Board of Directors negotiate with the telephone company to postpone the rate increase, the atmosphere at the meeting became extremely tense. As a result, the motion to postpone the telephone rate increase was passed with amendments, and a special committee was organized to handle it. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Meeting Agenda</p>
<p>The meeting began at 5:00 PM sharp. Foreign taxpayers flocked to participate, with a total of 897 attendees, more than half of whom were Japanese residents. The agenda consisted of eleven items: (1) Election of the Chairman, Mr. Baker was elected; (2) Election of the Meeting Secretary, Mr. Beasley was elected; (3) Request the attendees to adopt the rules of procedure; (4) The Chairman of the Board to present the work report and accounts of the previous year for approval; (5) The Chairman of the Board to present the budget proposal for the current year for approval; (6) Election of one Real Estate Committee member, Mr. Peake was elected; (7) Election of four directors of the Public Hospital, Dr. Dunn, Dr. Barson, Mr. Caran, and Mr. Boulder were elected; (8) Mr. Hausenrobe's motion to transfer the orchestra to a private organization with an annual subsidy of 150,000 yuan; (9) Mr. Hausenrob's motion to investigate the possibility of levying taxes on vacant houses, vacant land, and unregistered land, and to publish the results; (10) Mr. Hausenlai's motion to raise 5 million yuan to purchase land and expand roads; (11) Mr. Kanematsu's motion to request the Board of Directors to negotiate with the telephone company to postpone the rate increase.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report</p>
<p>After passing the third item on the agenda, Chairman Arnold rose and gave a speech, reporting on the work and accounts of the previous year and requesting approval. Chairman Arnold first mentioned that the security situation in the past year was very good. He then stated that Shanghai, due to the impact of the global economic depression and China's economic difficulties, was facing a particularly serious unemployment problem. In the first three months of this year, no less than 34 factories in the Public Concession closed down, affecting approximately 20,000 workers. Therefore, maintaining security required redoubled attention.</p>
<p>Extramural Road Issues</p>
<p>The negotiation of extramural road issues began from July 1930 to June 1932. A draft resolution had already been prepared, but both the municipal government and the Board of Directors representatives had to seek instructions from their superiors. The proposed draft was a matter of principle and did not include specific measures. For the sake of prudence, the Bureau sought the opinions of the Consular Body on this matter. By August, the representatives of the United Kingdom and the United States had notified that their respective governments had expressed approval, but the Japanese Consul General did not agree. The main reason seemed to be the policing issue. After continued discussions from 1933 to the spring of 1934, an agreement was reached on the number and organization of police officers. As for the size of the district, in October, the Chinese representative proposed that a narrow strip of land be demarcated on each side of the roads, including several Bureau properties. The Japanese Consul General did not agree to this proposal and put forward a counter-proposal, which was not accepted by the Chinese side. Throughout the negotiation process, the representatives of the municipal government were extremely open and candid, and the various points that had been agreed upon seemed appropriate. As for the present situation, the negotiation seemed to have stalled, as the difficulties that arose were unexpected, and the final result was difficult to predict.</p>
<p>West District Electricity Issue</p>
<p>The extramural road issue involves various public utilities, with electricity and water being the most important. Therefore, the two companies proceeded to negotiate with the Chinese authorities, originally hoping that the extramural road issue could be resolved at an early date, but this did not materialize. Therefore, the electricity company feared that another company would obtain a concession in the area, which would result in significant losses. In order to protect itself, it signed a special contract with the Chinese authorities on January 4 this year to establish the West District Electricity Company to undertake the electricity supply. The signing of this contract has led to an extremely complex situation. The Board of Directors has taken steps to protect the Bureau's rights and interests, but for the long-term interests of the citizens, it prefers to consider practical cooperation rather than insist on a strict interpretation of legal texts.</p>
<p>Telephone Rate Increase Incident</p>
<p>In January of this year, the telephone company petitioned for a rate increase, hoping to reach 22.89% of total revenue. According to the franchise contract, the company is entitled to a one-point dividend, but the company claims that this cannot be achieved with the current rates. This has caused many protests, but the public seems to be largely unaware of the content of this issue. The franchise contract must be observed by both parties, and the company has the right to demand its fulfillment. Since the company has proven that its revenue has not reached the amount stipulated in the contract, the Bureau cannot but allow the rate increase according to the agreement. Otherwise, the Bureau would be in breach of contract and would be liable for damages. The current problem facing the Board of Directors is not whether a rate increase is appropriate during a time of economic depression, but whether the company has the right to increase rates. As for the actual amount of the increase, the Bureau has reviewed it and believes that an increase of up to 12.5% is sufficient to meet the needs (subject to the approval of the French Concession). As for the implementation of pay-per-call billing, this is another issue. In general, pay-per-call billing is indeed in line with economic principles, but there are various local conditions that must be carefully considered. This is something that the Bureau can decide.</p>
<p>Rickshaw Reform Proposal</p>
<p>In May of last year, the Bureau established a Rickshaw Affairs Committee to promote reform proposals. However, in order to avoid the forced unemployment of rickshaw pullers, drastic measures were not taken. The Bureau's main objective is to improve the living conditions of rickshaw pullers, but the necessary preparatory procedures must be carried out first, such as registering rickshaw owners, reducing rickshaw rentals, registering rickshaw pullers, and improving vehicles. The registration of public rickshaw pullers has been progressing rapidly since warnings were issued to rickshaw owners, and has now reached 18,000. It is expected to be completed by June of this year. Considering the many difficulties encountered by the Rickshaw Affairs Committee, it can be said that it has achieved considerable success.</p>
<p>Allocation of Education Funds</p>
<p>Due to financial constraints, the Board of Directors had to reconsider the original education plan last year. As a result, it was decided that: (1) the total amount of education funds should not exceed two percent of the municipal tax and its associated land tax; (2) the expenses of the Bureau's Chinese and foreign children's schools should be given priority, but efforts should be made to reduce costs; (3) except for those already provided for in the budget, the construction of new schools should be postponed; (4) the subsidies for Chinese private schools should be increased by 50,000 yuan, and the subsidies for Japanese schools should be increased by 20,000 yuan. Given the current financial situation, this will still have to be done this year. However, this year, the subsidies for Japanese schools are expected to increase from 118,000 yuan to 128,000 yuan, and the subsidies for Chinese schools are expected to increase from 188,500 yuan to 208,760 yuan.</p>
<p>Factory Inspection Incident</p>
<p>At the 1933 annual meeting, the previous Chairman believed that the integrity of administration within the concession should be maintained. However, the Chinese authorities believed that all Chinese and foreign factories within the concession should comply with factory laws. After two years, there is still no way to reconcile these two opposing views, and the amended Attached Rule No. 34 is still not convenient to implement. However, in the past year, the Bureau has made considerable progress in adjusting and improving the industrial environment. Systematic investigations have been carried out on factory building structures, cleaning equipment, fire risk prevention, and the use of dangerous goods.</p>
<p>Report on Revenue and Expenditure in the Past Year</p>
<p>The 1934 financial report shows that various economies have saved a total of 1.1 million yuan in regular expenses. However, at the same time, tax revenue has also decreased by 440,000 yuan, so the surplus is only 700,000 yuan. However, because 2 million yuan of reserve funds were used under the revenue item, the actual situation is still that expenditures exceed revenue. As for temporary expenses, due to the slow progress of construction projects, approximately 1 million yuan less was spent. Based on the motion of last year's annual meeting, 7 million yuan in public bonds were raised in May. For a time, the subscription was very prosperous, but by the end of the year, the amount of 5.5 million yuan was still short. This must be included in this year's adjustment, etc. After the Chairman's report, it was passed by the whole body.</p>
<p>Current Year's Budget</p>
<p>Next, the fifth item on the agenda was discussed, and the Chairman presented the budget proposal for the current year and requested its approval. Chairman Arnold said that the total regular income for this year, including the surplus from the previous year, is approximately 25,913,850 yuan, an increase of approximately 850,000 yuan over the previous year. Among them, municipal taxes, license fees, and public utility revenue are all expected to increase. Of the income, 2,270,510 yuan should be allocated to education expenses. Regular expenses, excluding education expenses, are estimated to be 24,807,530 yuan (24,126,590 yuan last year). Now, all departments are making every effort to tighten expenditures, and new projects will not be undertaken unless they are urgently needed. However, given the size of this concession, municipal services must maintain their efficiency even during times of economic depression. In addition, in 1934, it was announced that the first batch of principal repayment funds had been allocated from this year onwards. This is done in accordance with past precedents. The total regular budget deficit is approximately 1.2 million yuan. According to normal theory, taxes should be increased to compensate for this. After careful consideration, it is still proposed to allocate from the reserve fund. However, the reserve fund will eventually be exhausted, so after the market improves, it must be considered to restore the previous tax rates to avoid hindering the rational development of municipal facilities. In the temporary budget, construction costs have been reduced significantly compared to last year. Those that have been stipulated are almost all limited to completing the work that has already been started and the road projects that can no longer be delayed. As for the new buildings in the police and health departments, they will not be started until the economic situation improves. A total of 14 million yuan has been listed under the item of debt repayment. It is hoped that it will be possible to raise debts within the year so that this can be carried out. Under the item of temporary income, it is planned to withdraw 8 million yuan from the debt repayment fund to repay the 19)5 public bonds, which is also part of the aforementioned 14 million. In addition, it is planned to sell some surplus land. The amount that is not enough should be requested from the taxpayers to authorize the Board of Directors to raise debts as appropriate, up to a maximum of 15.5 million yuan, etc. It was passed by the whole body.</p>
<p>Orchestra Case</p>
<p>After the election of candidates for the sixth and seventh items on the agenda (see above), the eighth item, Mr. Hausenrob's motion to transfer the orchestra to a private organization with an annual subsidy of 150,000 yuan, was discussed. First, Chairman Arnold said that at last year's annual meeting, the previous Chairman proposed to abolish the orchestra for financial reasons, but this was not passed. Now, the Board of Directors still maintains its historical attitude and leaves the decision on the existence or abolition of the orchestra to the taxpayers. The history of the orchestra dates back to before 1881, when it was originally organized by a private organization. Later, due to insufficient funding, it was decided by the taxpayers' meeting in that year that the Board of Directors would take over. However, it seems that the proposer of this motion did not consult with the relevant people beforehand, and the proposed method is extremely impractical. It is obviously a regressive action. What the taxpayers should decide today is only the word "existence" or "abolition," etc. The Chairman then put it to a vote, and as a result, Mr. Hausenrob's motion was rejected.</p>
<p>Proposal to Levy Taxes</p>
<p>Then, the ninth item on the agenda, Mr. Hausenrob's motion to investigate the possibility of levying taxes on vacant houses, vacant land, and unregistered land, and to publish the results, was discussed. The Chairman rose and said that the proposer of this motion seemed unaware that the Board of Directors had conducted detailed research on this issue for many years. In 1870, the taxpayers' annual meeting resolved that the Board of Directors should levy taxes on all unregistered land, regardless of the nationality of the landowner. In the following three years' budget proposals, this item of income was listed. However, in reality, the Bureau only received 18 taels, 9 mace, and 4 fen. This is because the holders of unregistered land are in possession of Chinese land deeds, and the Bureau cannot order them to present them for inspection. Since there is no way to know who the landowner is, or the relationship between the four boundaries, area, transfer, and division, it is impossible to levy taxes unless the landowner is willing to declare it for his own benefit. Since then, until 1893, this issue was raised again due to the demarcation of Hongkou. In 1920, due to the end of the European War, some people argued that since the registration of the Austrian consulate had been cancelled, the land that had been registered under it had become unregistered land and could not be subject to land tax. This proposal was rejected by the Board of Directors, as the Bureau had never given up the right to levy taxes on unregistered land, even if it could not collect taxes. From 1920 to the present, this issue has been raised due to various events. The Board of Directors has done its best to investigate, but because it involves political, legal, and practical aspects, if a survey report is rashly published, it will only affect the possibility of its resolution. Now, the difficulty of this issue is gradually being resolved, and the Board of Directors is studying further methods. For the benefit of taxpayers and the public, it is best to allow the Board of Directors to act expediently and not be constrained by frivolous opinions. Therefore, although the proposer of this motion is full of public spirit, from the overall point of view, it is still hoped that the attendees will reject it. What has been said above is only a discussion of the levying of taxes on unregistered land, but the situation for levying taxes on vacant houses with no occupants is exactly the same. Moreover, the levying of taxes on unregistered land has long been implemented, and it seems that the proposer did not know this, etc. The Chairman then put it to a vote, and as a result, this motion was also rejected.</p>
<p>Purchase of Land to Widen Roads</p>
<p>Discussing the tenth item on the agenda, Mr. Hausenrob proposed to raise 5 million yuan to purchase land and expand roads. The Chairman rose again and said that this motion is entirely a financial issue. The Board of Directors' policy has always been to take the opportunity to acquire land and widen roads whenever houses are rebuilt, as this can save costs and reduce interference with the commercial activities of the area. If land acquisition can be carried out promptly, it will naturally be in the public interest. From 1929 to 1933, the Bureau's expenditure on this item was approximately 1.5 million taels per year. Last year, it was also above 1.5 million yuan. Including road repair costs, nearly 14 million yuan has been spent in the past five years. However, in view of the current situation, construction costs must be drastically reduced in order to overcome this difficulty. In the temporary budget for this year, the Board of Directors has requested permission to raise 15.5 million yuan, which includes the cost of expanding roads. However, given the current economic situation, it is almost impossible to raise public debts. Moreover, if the proposed 5 million yuan can be raised, the construction costs after the land acquisition will require an additional 350,000 yuan per year. If taxes are not increased, other projects will inevitably be put on hold and funds will be diverted to this use. Therefore, as far as the current situation is concerned, there is no need to adopt this motion. If increasing the amount of debt is indeed beneficial, the Board of Directors will automatically make this request, etc. As a result, this motion was also rejected.</p>
<p>Telephone Rate Increase</p>
<p>Finally, the eleventh item, Mr. Kanematsu's motion to request the Board of Directors to negotiate with the telephone company to postpone the rate increase, was discussed. At this point, the atmosphere at the meeting suddenly became tense. First, Mr. Kanematsu, the Secretary-General of the Japanese Youth Association and the original proposer, took the stage to give a speech, eloquently explaining the reasons for the proposal and explaining and refuting the pre-drawn large telephone company rate increase chart in detail. He said that this was not a matter for a part of the Japanese residents, but was related to the interests of all Shanghai citizens. The telephone company belongs to Shanghai and should serve all of Shanghai, etc. This won warm applause from the entire venue. His speech briefly stated that, according to past official reports, there have been four telephone company rate increases. The first time, the company authorities requested an increase of 40%. The second time, the Board of Directors advocated an increase of 25%. The third time, the company requested an increase of 22%. The fourth time, the Board of Directors advocated an increase of 12.5%. In addition, there have been several informal increase reports. At a time when the economy is declining and all industries are sluggish, this rate increase is deeply difficult for people of all countries and all sectors of society. Calculating on the basis of the telephone company's capital of 135 million yuan, if the rates are increased according to the new regulations, it will be 2% in the first year, 15% in the seventh year, 20% in the ninth year, and 25% in the eleventh year. Rather than causing future disputes, it is better to resolve them as soon as possible. Moreover, since the Board of Directors has reduced the promised 11.5% to 10%, eliminating the rate increase is not absolutely impossible, etc. Then, the Chairman rose again and said that he had mentioned in his annual report that the telephone company has the right to increase rates in accordance with the franchise contract. The public must know that the franchise contract creates significant obligations and responsibilities and cannot be unilaterally abolished. In order to fulfill its obligations, the Board of Directors has allowed it to increase rates by no more than 12.5%. However, how to increase them has not yet been determined. Now, it cannot break its promise. Moreover, any resolution of the taxpayers cannot abolish or change its contract without the consent of the company. If a dispute arises due to the resolution of the annual meeting, the company can request a ruling in accordance with the contract, and the result of the ruling will inevitably uphold the company's rights and allow a rate increase that far exceeds 12.5%. At the same time, the Bureau will have to pay a huge amount of damages. As for the statement that the rate increase should be determined after expert investigation, in 1929, the Bureau had already spent a large sum of money to hire internationally renowned experts to investigate this matter. Their report advocated a rate increase of 35%. Later, they even said that if they had foreseen the changes in exchange rates at that time, they would have advocated an even greater increase. However, after negotiations between the Board of Directors and the company, the rates were only increased three years later after the completion of the automatic switching equipment (March 1932) according to the experts' recommendations. The company also agreed not to seek any further increases for the next two years. As far as the current situation is concerned, there is no need to spend a large sum of money to re-invite experts. Moreover, it seems unlikely that experts will deny the rate increase in order to maintain the contract. As for the current matter, it is only a financial issue, and the Bureau's staff is fully capable of handling it. In short, if the taxpayers' meeting makes a hasty decision, the result may be that the taxpayers will be placed in an unfavorable position, and it will not be possible to abolish the contract in the end. It is hoped that the attendees will deal with it carefully, etc.</p>
<p>Organize a Special Committee</p>
<p>After a debate on this motion that lasted for an hour, the Chairman put it to a vote. As a result, it was passed with amendments to Mr. Kanematsu's original proposal, that is, adding the organization of a special committee to investigate, research, and handle it to the eleventh original proposal. For the sake of prudence, the Chairman held a further vote when adjourning the meeting and leaving the venue. As a result, it was passed by 371 votes to 263 votes against. The adjournment was then announced. It was already 8:00 PM.</p>

<p>Record of Mayor Wu's Opening Speech</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, today, the Shanghai Municipal Government's Civilian Welfare Undertaking Management Committee is holding its inaugural meeting. I am very grateful for the enthusiastic support of all the members and for taking the time to attend. At the same time, I am even more pleased that the civilian welfare undertakings of this city, thanks to the enthusiastic support of the leaders of all sectors of this city, have been transformed from ideals and hopes into facts and have begun to be implemented. Today, I would like to take this opportunity to report to you the purpose of this city in undertaking civilian welfare undertakings and ask for your guidance. Following the social and economic changes after the Industrial Revolution, the duties of modern governments have become increasingly complex due to the needs of the objective era. The meaning of modern countries, whether left-leaning or right-leaning, has shifted from passive securityism to active socialism. Matters that governments did not pay attention to or even interfere with in the past have now become the obligations that governments should fulfill, and these obligations have been stipulated in the constitutions of various countries after the European War. Although the current stage of China's social economy has not yet reached the stage of industrial development, and the revolutionary strategy of Marxism has been proven to be absolutely unsuitable for China by objective social conditions, we observe from a historical perspective that China's political philosophy has its own characteristics that are different from those of other countries, that is, the moderate Confucianism, whose ideal of nation-building also deeply contains the spirit of socialism, such as the so-called "men have their duties, women have their homes, the strong are employed, the young are nurtured, and the widowed, orphaned, lonely, disabled, and sick are all cared for." Therefore, the governance of ancient China has always been based on education and care as the two major principles. From a realistic perspective, our revolutionary mentor, Mr. Sun Yat-sen, said in his instructions on the steps of nation-building, "The primary task of construction is people's livelihood." At the same time, he said more specifically in the law on the implementation of local autonomy, "Local autonomous organizations are not only political organizations, but also economic organizations. In recent years, the duties of governments in civilized countries have gradually expanded from politics to economics. In ancient China, governance combined education and care. Later generations regressed, and the government abandoned the duties of education and care and allowed the people to care for and educate themselves. The government only existed as a passive entity that did not disturb the people, which was considered good governance. By the Han and Tang dynasties, the responsibility of protecting and governing the people had not yet been abandoned, so they were still able to resist strong enemies externally and redress grievances internally. Later, even this was abandoned, and the country was destroyed and the government ceased to exist. Civilization was lost, and the barbarians enjoyed the benefits of this for more than three hundred years. The people of the Republic of China should quickly establish the foundation of a thousand-year-old Republic of China with local autonomy. It is appropriate to learn from the trend of the world, adopt the latest ideals, and seek the happiness of all the people. Therefore, the responsibility of Chinese statesmen at this time should be to meet the trend of the times, take the spirit of catching up, and build a new society and a new country for the benefit of all the people, in order to establish a foundation for a thousand-year-old Republic of China. Because the resolution of the problems of the majority of civilians is not only a direct benefit to the civilians themselves, but also the starting point of the country and society. Although the past few years in this city have been a time of hardship and difficulty, it is now gradually showing signs of recovery. From now on, we should naturally seek active construction. In order to implement this goal, we have specifically designated this year as the Year of Social Construction and have given special attention to the implementation of civilian welfare undertakings. I have already reported on these undertakings and announced them in various newspapers, and I think you have all seen them. However, in order to promote their implementation, how to proceed smoothly, and achieve satisfactory results, we must hope for the practical guidance, mutual cooperation, and enthusiastic support of all of you.</p>

<p>Educational News</p>
<p>Ministry of Education Order: Setting up Training Classes for Private School Teachers</p>
<p>Using Summer Vacation for Training (Nanjing, 17th)</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education has ordered all departments and bureaus, stating: "Upon investigation, the organization and curriculum of private schools mostly do not comply with the regulations of educational laws. Most of their teachers are also unqualified elementary school teachers, often being completely unaware of teaching and training methods. While these should be strictly prohibited, considering the current state of education not yet being widespread, their existence can be permitted within the scope that does not hinder local elementary school enrollment. Educational administrative organs should make every effort to supervise and guide them to improve, thereby assisting in the promotion of compulsory education.</p>
<p>Now, to improve private schools and promote compulsory education, you are hereby instructed to inform your subordinates. Educational administrative organs in all counties and cities should, starting from this year, make use of summer vacation to gather private school teachers from various places and organize training classes for them. The subjects should be based on the actual needs of the teachers, focusing on basic knowledge and teaching methods in subjects such as Mandarin, arithmetic, and general knowledge. The lectures should emphasize the explanation of practical problems and practical exercises, rather than lecturing on theoretical knowledge. Examinations should be conducted afterward as a basis for rewards and punishments. The specific measures for the training classes should be promptly drafted in detail according to local conditions and submitted to the Ministry for review before the end of May."</p>
<p>Ministry of Education Report: Equipment for Science, Chemistry, and Biology in Secondary Schools (Nanjing, 17th)</p>

The Ministry has previously established standards for equipment in these subjects in secondary schools and has ordered compliance. Currently, the Ministry needs to assess whether the equipment in secondary schools in various provinces and cities is adequate. Please promptly investigate and list the equipment status of each subject in public and private secondary schools under your jurisdiction and formulate future improvement plans, submitting them for review within one month of receiving this document."</p>

<p>Zhang Yuanruo Speaks on How to Study Legal Science</p>
<p>Yesterday was the ninth day of the National Reading Movement Conference organized by the Chinese Cultural Construction Association. Zhang Yuanruo, the director of the Shanghai College of Political Science and Law, was specially invited to speak on how to study legal science. The following is a transcript of his speech:</p>
<p>The Importance and Difficulty of Methods</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, I am honored to be invited by the Chinese Cultural Construction Association to speak on how to study legal science. Due to time constraints, I cannot elaborate fully but can only provide a brief outline for your reference. First, we must understand the importance and difficulty of methods in studying legal science. The importance of methods can be explained in three points. First, the definition and nature of law are interpreted differently by various schools of thought. Scholars studying law often find it difficult to answer the question of the definition and nature of law. Therefore, those who are new to the study of law must seriously consider the method. Second, the various theories in legal science are vast and complex. How we can study their merits and demerits also depends on whether the method is appropriate. Third, the purpose of law is not to create rigid provisions but to apply them to govern people and maintain society. Therefore, law has a great impact on the prosperity and decline of a nation and the strength and weakness of a country. Therefore, the method of studying legal science must be considered. The importance of studying legal methods is as mentioned above, and the difficulty of studying methods cannot be fully explained in a few words. Now, I will explain it in three points. First, studying law is not only a scientific problem but also a philosophical problem. Therefore, beginners who want to make achievements in legal research must integrate and understand the various schools of thought to gain profound insights. Otherwise, they will not be able to use them freely. Second, from the static aspect of law, that is, from the theoretical aspect, it can be divided into philosophical, comparative, analytical, and social historical aspects. The various schools of thought are quite inconsistent, and each has its own strengths and weaknesses. Therefore, we must study the merits and demerits of each school of thought. From this, we can see the difficulty of the method. Third, from the dynamic perspective of the trend of the times, the study of law was narrowly defined in the past, that is, speaking about the law in terms of the law, only studying the wording of the provisions. Today, it is broadly defined and requires a profound study of various social sciences. In the past, it was only a theoretical study. Today, we must take into account the facts and consult extensively to be complete and sound. In the past, it was only a study of provisions. Today, it has evolved from the study of provisions to the study of practical applications. The importance of methods is as such, and the difficulty of methods is also so. Therefore, beginners should study with an objective attitude and an open mind and never introduce subjective prejudices.</p>
<p>Speaking from the Position of Academic Research</p>
<p>World academia can be divided into natural sciences and social sciences. The goal of natural science is to govern and utilize nature. The goal of social science is to govern and improve society. Law is not only a part of the field of social science but also a crystallization of various social sciences. Those who study law must not only have basic knowledge of legal science but also have a profound understanding of various disciplines such as politics, economics, ethics, religion, philosophy, logic, history, society, psychology, and anthropology. With the cultivation and preparation of the above disciplines, legal research can be advanced. Therefore, in terms of essence, law is at the forefront of social sciences. In terms of application, law is a tool for governing society in a passive sense and also has the function of improving society and promoting society in an active sense. From this, we can see its academic status. Therefore, beginners should recognize the noble greatness of law on the one hand. At the same time, the attitude of research should be humble and start from the basics. We must not be too ambitious. We must build our foundation from the above disciplines before we can achieve anything.</p>
<p>Speaking from the Content of the Learning Method</p>
<p>Our method of studying law should be to study substantive law first and then procedural law. Substantive law is civil law and criminal law. Procedural law is litigation law. Substantive law is the main law, and procedural law is the auxiliary law. We should study the main law first and then the auxiliary law. Second, we should study the common law first and then the special law. The common law is the basic laws and regulations and important laws and regulations. Special law is a specific type of law based on the common law. After studying the common law, studying the special law can be easily solved. Third, we should study the general theory first and then the specific theory. The general theory is the general theory of law, the general theory of civil law, and criminal administrative law. The specific theory is the law of obligations, property rights, and kinship. After we study the general theory, we can study the specific theory in an orderly manner and find a hierarchy.</p>
<p>Speaking from the Schools of Learning</p>
<p>The schools of world law are different, each with its own methods and conclusions. Those belonging to the pure theory school can be divided into the pure philosophy school and the natural law school. These two schools believe that law is not due to creation. They focus on the basis of legal theory and explore the essence of law outside of human-made law. They criticize the ideal standard of real law and seek its so-called rational law and natural law that can be passed down for all ages and applicable to all countries. Those belonging to the empirical school can be divided into the analytical school, the comparative law school, the historical school, and the sociological school. The analytical school studies the developed legal system and regards the legislator as a conscious creator. The comparative law school believes that law is a product of geography and race. The historical school believes that law is an accumulation of the spirit of the nation. The sociological school is based on the theory of the advocate of positive philosophy, Comte, and studies law as a social phenomenon. The schools of thought have different theories. Beginners should seek a correct understanding of the nature of law and humbly explore the strengths, weaknesses, similarities, and differences of each school of thought before they can gain a deep foundation.</p>
<p>Speaking from the Practical Application</p>
<p>Law is not a rigid, subjective provision. It is an objective social product that should be reformed and improved according to social needs and the trend of the times. Therefore, we should study general principles from concrete facts. Theories are often too empty. Whether the theory can be applied to the facts is a highly questionable issue. Therefore, the American scholar Foard strongly opposes mechanical legal science. Second, we should study from the perspective of objective function. The subjective provisions should be studied objectively and analytically. Law is produced for society, not society is produced for the application of law. Therefore, we should not focus on the provisions of the law itself but on social interests. Legal researchers should have a major realization that they should not only seek the fairness of the law and the ideal of fairness but also seek the fairness of implementation and the fairness of execution.</p>
<p>Speaking from the Required Conditions</p>
<p>Those who study law should first have a wealth of knowledge. Various social sciences must have a profound foundation. Second, they must be rich in practical experience. As the saying goes, heaven, reason, state, and law are human feelings. It can be said that the philosophical concept of Chinese law also has a clear understanding of the world and familiarity with human feelings. The so-called worldly affairs and human feelings are the source of formulating and applying the law. US President Lincoln did not study law, but he made a great contribution to the law. This is due to practical experience. Third, they must have a pure and great personality. Although law is not morality, it is a tool to protect morality. Moreover, law is a tool to govern people. Law enforcers should be role models for the masses. Therefore, those who study law should have a sound personality and great and pure integrity.</p>
<p>Prospects for Chinese Legal Science</p>
<p>Chinese legal circles have fallen to a low point. One of the reasons is that the traditional psychology of the general public is that law is cruel, unkind, and strict. This influence is not very profound. The most painful thing is that in recent times, the trickery of lawyers has made people feel that legal researchers are all corrupt and unfaithful people. In fact, there have been great legal researchers in Chinese history in all dynasties. Guan Zhong, Zichan, Shang Yang, Han Fei, Wang Anshi, Zhang Juzheng, Huang Lizhou, and others from the Zhou and Qin dynasties were all brilliant scholars in Chinese legal history. Therefore, those who govern the law in China should learn from Guan Zhong's sentiments. Second, due to the aggravation of the morbid state of the times, it has fallen into a low point. If we want to restore the glory of the past, those who govern the law must recognize the position of legal science in academics and its profound relationship with the strength of the country and the nation.</p>

<p>Overseas Silver Prices Retract</p>
<p>Gold Mark-up Rises Four Yuan</p>
<p>Swap Market More Short Than Long by Half a Yuan</p>
<p>The gold market yesterday turned mostly stable, lacking any special fluctuations. Although the Central Bank, China Bank, and Sassoon continued to exert pressure, the daily bank and other buyers were quite strong. Market sentiment had already improved, resulting in a firm outcome. In the morning, both overseas silver markets had retracted, with the closing price of the large-foot silver market reporting weakness, and the Monde 里 forward silver price also experiencing a sharp decline. Exchange rates rose, and London spot gold fell by seven pence. Extramarket preparatory trading opened, rising to 17-18 yuan, but sellers were still plentiful. The Central Bank's listed prices were revealed, with both British and American rates remaining unchanged. The customs gold unit fell by seven li, and the standard price for the gold mark-up fell to 861.2 yuan, leading to a lower opening in the morning. After the opening, banks showed strong buying interest, and major players took advantage of the low prices to return, actually breaking through the 20-yuan mark. The Bank of China blocked with shillings, hindering the upward trend and causing it to fall back below 20 yuan. The HSBC's listed prices were revealed, with both British and American rates remaining unchanged. At this time, Hengxing was still advancing with multiple trades, but Sassoon, the Central Bank, and others continued to sell, and the foreign exchange market loosened, falling once. The revealed silver equalization tax remained unchanged and had little impact. However, as banks maintained their position while prices were low, the market stabilized after falling. Later, major players aggressively bought in, exciting market sentiment and causing prices to rise. The foreign exchange market also tightened as the Japanese Bank</p>

<p>Shanghai Newspaper Local Supplement - Random Notes on Suicide Incidents Dreamruo</p>
<p>The instability of Shanghai society can be seen from the increasing number of suicide cases. Every day, when reading the local newspapers' social news, you can often find one or two suicide messages that are quite striking. These constantly occurring suicide cases are clearly telling you that at present, many people in Shanghai society are already feeling the hardship of survival and have no choice but to embark on the final journey!</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs released a suicide statistics report for the city in the 23rd year: a total of 2,325 suicide cases throughout the year, including 1,122 men and 1,203 women. The causes of suicide were: verbal disputes were the most common, followed by economic pressure, and then family accidents. Suicide results: a total of 501 deaths, 1,816 rescues, and 8 unknown. Age of suicides: 21 to 30 years old was the most common, totaling 1,141, followed by 31 to 40 years old, totaling 461, and then 20 years old, totaling 438.</p>
<p>According to the report from the Bureau of Social Affairs, the large number of suicide cases in the city last year was unprecedented in previous years. If the year is calculated as 365 days, then on average, more than six suicide incidents occur in the city every day, and one occurs every four hours. This number is really shocking and worthy of attention from those who care about social issues!</p>
<p>The endless emergence of suicide incidents is a negative phenomenon in society. The occurrence of this negative phenomenon is attributed by some to the weakness of individual will, and by others to the oppression of the social environment. However, in our observation, both are causes of suicide cases, and the latter is more important than the former. Therefore, to remedy suicide, one must consider both aspects.</p>
<p>However, today's Shanghai society is an unhealthy and deformed society. Various morbidities exist early on in this society. A person living in this society inevitably faces a terrible threat to their life. Therefore, we believe that suicide cases in this city cannot be reduced at present!</p>
<p>Small Town in a Mining Area Tuoren</p>
<p>The train sped through the jungle, and what jumped into view was a deep valley, surrounded by towering peaks. This is the coal mining area.</p>
<p>The iron wheels of the train slowly and tortuously rolled on the hillside, crossing a small, clear mountain stream where you could see the pebbles below, and then entered the platform shrouded in black coal piles towering on all sides.</p>
<p>The people on the platform were so few that there was no vitality. I was squeezed out of the black carriage in the crowd. Several children doing petty business were calling out their wares on the station with bamboo baskets, but in an instant, everyone dispersed. Several old men carried down the unsold fruits from the city from the carriages, pressed them on their shoulders with disappointment, and walked away behind the rails. The person standing at the station office door waved the green flag and blew a silver whistle. The train, a long string of carriages, wriggled past behind the platform. The military station returned to silence. The children selling food were still sitting on the wooden benches of the platform with sad faces, waiting for the train that would come from the city again in two hours. Walking down the platform and crossing the rails lying on the coal dust, less than a hundred steps away, a small street market unfolded in front.</p>
<p>In this mountain valley filled with coal smoke, surrounded by high peaks, this street market is the only marketplace for the tens of thousands of residents living here. Everything is concentrated on this narrow street.</p>
<p>If in a city, a small shop of less than two hundred rooms lined up like this might still be a quiet place, but here, it appears bustling, with people as crowded as on a prosperous street in a big city, and noisy sounds echoing in every corner.</p>
<p>The road surface, paved with crushed stones, has become a slippery mud road under the trampling of people's feet and the random splashing of wastewater from vendors. There is rarely a clean patch of ground. Although there are only about two hundred houses here, they are arranged so briefly that they do not span more than a few hundred steps from beginning to end, but here, there are all kinds of shops: hotels, restaurants, foreign goods stores, grocery stores, restaurants, teahouses, coal shops, rice shops, bathhouses, everything is complete, as if it were a street in a big city. The pedestrians here, apart from the energetic workers preparing to go to work in the mines and the tired workers returning from work in the mines, are just rural women and children, and no other kind of people can be seen. We are just occasional visitors.</p>
<p>It was already dusk. After traveling from early morning to this time, I already felt mentally tired. A group of people were swallowed by the open door of the hotel.</p>
<p>There were two hotels on this street, and our group had already filled more than a dozen small rooms in one of them. Living in such a hotel is even more depressing than living in a birdcage-like pavilion in the city. However, the tired bodies of travelers feel extraordinarily comfortable lying on the bed, as if entering a world of supreme bliss.</p>
<p>Night, like a black cloth, enveloped the earth. The dim kerosene lamp flickered in the silent heart of the street. A burst of music and women's singing echoed deeply.</p>
<p>"Are there any opera singers here?"</p>
<p>Sitting on the wooden stool at the doorway of the dark hotel, I asked a young servant in the hotel.</p>
<p>"Yes. There are singers and sleepers. There are two brothels here. At night, there are girls singing in the teahouses. You can call them over too, the price is very cheap."</p>
<p>The young servant told me very clearly, as if soliciting business for them, making it very clear.</p>
<p>"There are quite a few tricks here."</p>
<p>"Where? A few years ago, this place was really lively! Business was not only done in this mining area, but people from the villages in front and behind the mountains came here to trade. In recent years, because the harvest in the fields has been bad and the wages of the miners have been reduced too much, this place has become so deserted! Otherwise, it would be even more lively than the city."</p>
<p>The young servant mumbled these words after pursing his lips for a long time. But from his words, one can imagine how prosperous the countryside was a few years ago!</p>
<p>Night Snack Hua Mu</p>
<p>In Shanghai, although there are countless people struggling under the iron wheels of life, unable to get enough to eat during the day, apart from a portion living like in paradise, there are still large groups living in lane houses, eating simple meals, and living ordinary lives. If you belong to this middle class, then you may not be without some leisure. Living this kind of life, although you may not praise Shanghai as a paradise on earth, a world of supreme bliss, at least you are unwilling to leave it under any conditions. There are many places that will make you realize that Shanghai is indeed lovely.</p>
<p>Lane life, of course, has many unsightly elements mixed in, but it also has many characteristics that perfectly and flawlessly satisfy your sense of pleasure. This kind of pleasure, this leisure, is naturally something that the starving people living in thatched huts and the "darlings" living in mansions and apartments cannot appreciate and enjoy.</p>
<p>When the sounds of the city gradually subside at night, the lanes gradually enter a state of sleep. The sounds of clappers from the night snack vendors and the long, quiet, and pure low calls pass by under the windows in a melodious manner. At this time, you may be lying in bed or still savoring your favorite book under the glaring light. Hearing these seductive sounds, a kind of feeling that is both ethereal and rich secretly crawls out from your heart. You will no longer hate and fear that it will disturb your thoughts and sleepiness. You can use familiar and accurate discernment to distinguish what kind of sound is selling what. This is wonton. That is Cantonese-style fish congee...</p>
<p>This peddler passes by, and another comes closer and closer from afar. Listening, counting, cravings surge to the throat, you can no longer read the book, sleepiness flies away, completely losing rational self-control, as if hypnotized. Then, you touch your wallet, your craving soaring, lean against the window and look out, shouting.</p>
<p>—Hey, one bowl!</p>
<p>Or.</p>
<p>—One bowl of fish congee!</p>
<p>Immediately, a humble and cunning response comes back.</p>
<p>—Okay, one bowl of wontons.</p>
<p>On the quiet table, a light, smoky aroma flies up. The fragrance stabs your nose, you leisurely raise two fingers, pinch the spoon, scoop up the stomach-filling delicacy, and send it to your mouth one spoonful at a time. At this time, you will no longer use the crude and chaotic attitude of dining, naturally revealing an elegant demeanor, chewing carefully, savoring deeply. After a while, two lips are沾粘with a thin layer of greasiness, and the bowl is empty. The two角子say goodbye to you. Flew away.</p>
<p>However, rest assured, although the角子have flown away, you will not feel regret. The desire for pleasure has been fully satisfied, there is nothing else to ask for. Wipe your mouth, smoke a cigarette, and you can fall asleep soundly.</p>
<p>If your landlord on the third floor also knows how to enjoy the fun of night snacks, then when a small basket containing a bowl of fragrant佳打passes by your window, another indescribable joy will fill your heart. Like eating Foshan Blind Man's Candy, it is fragrant, sweet, crispy, and flaky. You cannot tell which flavor is particularly good, because he has become your comrade under the same desire. Although the two of you cannot see each other, you have understood each other and are smiling knowingly.</p>
<p>However, this kind of night snack fun also varies in intensity with the seasons. In summer nights, it is usually not very enjoyable. Because the stuffiness of the lane house will still make you sweat even at night. In this mood, you will not think of the passing night snack peddler. The most suitable, of course, is winter and autumn nights.</p>
<p>The Mortal World Yingzi</p>
<p>From the time they first began to understand a little about the world, for some unknown reason, they were sent to Nanshan by their father to become novice monks.</p>
<p>From that time until now, a full seven or eight long years have passed, and they have not seen their parents' faces even once. Therefore, the appearance and demeanor of their parents are simply not imprinted in their childish minds. Therefore, at this time, they felt so lonely and sad, thinking that they were people without fathers, mothers, sisters, or relatives. So sometimes in secret, they often lamented their unfortunate life. In such a lonely time, apart from confiding their heart full of melancholy and sadness to the Buddha Dharma, they had no other way to relieve their sorrow.</p>
<p>They often heard the abbot talk about "the mortal world," and in their hearts, they imagined how dangerous, troubled, filthy, ugly, and full of beasts, poisonous snakes, and demons the human world was. Therefore, although they were currently tormented by the thought of missing their parents, when they thought about the people living in such a "lower world," they felt that they were happier than anyone else. However, how quickly did this happiness disappear in their minds! As they gradually grew older, when the sharp changes in their physiology and the natural demands of human nature erupted, they could not suppress their desires no matter what. Regarding the so-called "unbearable mortal world," they often had all kinds of illusions. Even if they did not want to come to "the human world" to try its flavors, they really wanted to understand what "the mortal world" was all about!</p>
<p>One day, when the elder brother took advantage of the abbot's absence, he asked his younger brother with a questioning tone:</p>
<p>"According to the abbot, the mortal world is empty, illusory, and ugly, but the impression I have recently gotten is not like that! The mortal world also has magnificent pavilions, elegant and exquisite gardens, clear mountains and green waters, and bright spring scenery, everything seems to be no less than on the mountain."</p>
<p>"That's right," the younger brother replied, "The mortal world may not be much different from the mountain, but brother, don't you remember the abbot's words? The worst and filthiest thing over there is the root of all evil, and that is women! With women, the mortal world cannot be compared to the mountain." The younger brother said with great confidence.</p>
<p>"So, women must be hateful animals..." The elder novice monk then looked at the younger novice monk with suspicion, and then he said in a low voice, "But according to my recent observation, it is not like that. Haven't you seen that when those young girls, dressed in red and green clothes, come to the mountain to offer sacrifices to the Buddha and immortals, their gentle and graceful actions, their charming posture, and their affectionate eyes and smooth faces, I don't see much difference from goddesses. I heard that the abbot often secretly goes down the mountain behind our backs to seek pleasure with those women. The abbot recites lofty scriptures, but what occupies his heart is this so-called "filthy mortal world." So I have already developed a bad sense of sin towards the Buddha Dharma. In fact, I think as long as we do not do evil deeds, are not tempted, and maintain our pure hearts, I think everywhere is the same...."</p>
<p>The younger brother only nodded, feeling that the elder novice monk's words were half-believed and half-doubted.</p>
<p>Amateur Mailbox - Legal Rights to Inherit Property</p>
<p>Dear Editor:</p>
<p>I am a shop assistant with little knowledge and can be considered a person without any judgment. Recently, I have encountered a problem that I think is extremely difficult to solve, so I have to trouble you to give me a clear indication.</p>
<p>The facts are as follows: I have an uncle and a father. Both my father and my uncle make a living by teaching in the village, while my uncle went out to do business when he was young and earned a lot of money. He only returned to his hometown in recent years to enjoy his old age. However, although he is already over fifty years old, he does not have a son. Four years ago, he had the intention of making me his heir, but at that time I was still studying outside and don't know why he changed his mind. Later, he made his uncle's son his heir. However, that cousin (uncle's son) is not on the right track and is actually associating with gangsters, often asking my uncle for money to gamble, drink, and prostitute himself, truly doing all kinds of evil. My uncle was extremely angry and kicked him out. My uncle also did not take him in, so he drifted outside and there has been no news of him for more than two years. Recently, my uncle discussed with my father again to make me his adopted son. Of course, we have no objections to this matter, but the problem arises: because my cousin, although he has been expelled, will definitely not give up this property. How should I deal with him in the future if he gets entangled with me? Does he have any legal grounds to sue me? Respectfully, Shen Bin</p>
<p>Editor's Note: Article 1143 of the Inheritance Section of the Civil Code stipulates: "If there are no lineal descendants, a will may be used to designate an heir for all or part of the property, but this shall be in accordance with the provisions regarding special reserved portions." Therefore, Mr. Shen's uncle can, of course, freely designate anyone as the heir to his property. However, because there is a fact of raising the cousin in the past (according to the letter, it seems that the formalities of "withdrawal of inheritance" have not been formally completed), in order to avoid future disputes, Mr. Shen's uncle should quickly go to the court or the county government兼理司法的to file the procedures for "withdrawal of inheritance" (referring to the cousin) and "establishment of inheritance" (referring to Mr. Shen), and at the same time, the will must be prepared; in our opinion, this will should adopt a "notarized will" to be appropriate.</p>
<p>The above is just a way to solve this problem from a legal standpoint. But we believe that enjoying unearned wealth can only cultivate people's habits of pleasure and extravagance, and there is a danger of extinguishing the enterprising spirit of young people, which is not a very gratifying thing. Therefore, if Mr. Shen's uncle insists on making Mr. Shen his heir, in order to make the old man feel comforted, of course, he cannot refuse. But you must never think of this as an opportunity to make a fortune! Mr. Shen's responsibility is to find a way to find his cousin and guide him to the right path. After a person has been greatly stimulated, it is easy to abandon evil and return to goodness. At that time, Mr. Shen should also intercede on his behalf in front of his uncle and restore their relationship. As for the uncle's property, it may be divided equally between the two. This way, he will not disappoint the old man now, and he can take care of the feelings of his brothers, and he will not lose considerable benefits himself: this is the most appropriate and noblest solution.</p>
<p>Finally, because it is not yet known whether Mr. Shen's cousin can be determined to do good, we believe that legal procedures should still be completed as soon as possible, so that the right can be exercised by oneself. This is what is meant by having a complete plan.</p>

<p>Opening Piece "Song of Grieving for Spring"</p>
<p>Fair face is gaunt, thinking of yearning for spring. Husband is separated, failing the spring. Thinking back to the passionate flower candle night in the bridal chamber. Warm in the hibiscus curtain, spending the night in spring. Slowly looking under the dressing table curtain. Drawing eyebrows, smiling and containing spring. A moment of gold is wasted. Now it is as cold as ice, doubling the grief for spring. Cunning parrot especially understands tongue. Sour plum bitter meets spring. Aunt does not understand, who will recover? How can I be unfeeling, pitying spring? Other new people have intimate smiles. How can the old woman cry for the remaining spring? Pretty brother lively and diligently asks. Father, why are you separated and having another love for spring? Containing tears of hardship, the fate is like a dream. Hating to have no comforting words, falsely scolding spring. Tasting medicine, wondering who will take care of it. Often sick, after all, little returning spring. Emptyly living years without other thoughts. Flesh and blood dear child is the spring of the eyes. Precarious confinement is predictable. Round and round, seemingly the spring in the mirror. Heaven and earth are long and never end. Continuous regret mistakes youth. It is really like falling into the grass withering spring.</p>

<p>The petty man is idle and does not do good. There is no place he does not reach. Seeing the gentleman, he then acts厌然. Robbing his lack of goodness. And writing his goodness. People seeing themselves. As seeing his lungs and liver. Then what benefit is there? This is called sincerity in the middle. Forming outside. Therefore, the gentleman must be careful of his solitude.</p>
<p>Idle living, being alone. 厌然, appearance of eliminating, suppressing and hiding. This says that the petty man secretly does not do good, and openly wants to cover it up, then right and wrong知普之to be right, and evil to be removed, but unable to actually use its strength, to the extent of this. But wanting to fight his evil, and ultimately not able to cover it up, wanting to falsely be good, and ultimately not able to be false, then what benefit is there? This is what the gentleman values as a warning, and must be careful of his solitude.</p>
<p>Radio News</p>
<p>It is reported that the Shanghai "Weeds Society" drama broadcast group has been praised by listeners since it broadcasted dramas.

<p>Shanghai Newspaper Local Supplement Movie Special Issue "Little Minister" Special Issue The Beginning and End of James Barrie's Famous Work "Little Minister" Being Made into a Movie Xiaosheng</p>
<p>(1) The Popularity After Publication</p>
<p>Sir James Barrie's world-renowned literary masterpiece "Little Minister" is now being brought to the silver screen with sound to satisfy the world's desire. The main character, Babbie, is played by the exceptional and talented actress Kathleen Hepburn.</p>
<p>When he wrote this story about a Gypsy girl and a minister's love story, Barrie never imagined that forty-three years later, this story would be enjoyed by millions of people around the world in a sound movie.</p>
<p>Since its initial publication in 1891, this novel has caused a sensation around the world and has been reprinted repeatedly. Later, the original author also wrote it into a script, which has been made into two silent films. And it is often broadcast on the radio. Now that it has been made into a sound movie, it will undoubtedly cause an even greater sensation and give people a deeper understanding.</p>
<p>In 1891, "Little Minister" was published daily in a London magazine. At the end of the same year, the single-volume edition of "Little Minister" made its first appearance to the world. This vivid, touching, and sorrowful love history immediately became a hit, receiving praise from millions of people. And the background of this novel, the author's hometown, the "Forest" village, has also become a world-renowned scenic spot. At that time, American newspapers published it one after another. According to recent surveys, more than one million copies of "Little Minister" have been sold in the United States alone. The publishing industry is still constantly reprinting it. Moreover, because of RKO's successful production, the sales of this immortal masterpiece have increased extraordinarily.</p>
<p>(2) The Script Conversion Was Equally Successful</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, "Little Minister" can be made into a script. In 1897, the author himself wrote it into a script. At that time, people's enthusiasm for welcoming and praising this script was the same as their enthusiasm for the novel.</p>
<p>Soon, this script was introduced to the Americas and obtained by the then-theatrical king Charles Frohman. After the play was performed, it became a sensation throughout the United States. And Miss Adams, who played the main character in the play, immediately became extremely popular. She performed "Little Minister" continuously on Broadway for as many as three hundred performances. Later, she traveled throughout the United States with "Little Minister." But the people of London did not have the pleasure of seeing "Little Minister" performed at the "Duke of York" theater until 1914. In 1934, Miss Adams broadcast "Little Minister" on New York National Radio. All the way to 1935, Rose Coghlan continued Miss Adams' role in starring in this play in New York. And the script has also been improved a lot.</p>
<p>Setbacks in Silent Film Era Production Feite</p>
<p>In the silent film era, many people were eager to bring "Little Minister" to the silver screen. Vitagraph Company then began to produce this "Little Minister" novel. But after some minor setbacks, the work was stopped.</p>
<p>In 1921, Paramount decided to make it into a movie. As soon as the news leaked, Vitagraph immediately came forward to oppose Paramount's production rights. But Paramount cleverly bought the copyrights of both scripts and secretly went to produce it. This matter was finally known to Vitagraph, and they quickly rushed to produce the "Little Minister" novel day and night. As a result, these two "Little Minister" silent films were performed on the American screen almost simultaneously.</p>
<p>RKO Pictures has now turned this immortal masterpiece of more than forty years into a sound film, with the "Little Women" protagonist Kathleen Hepburn and John Beal collaborating again. When Sir Barrie, the original author of the script, heard this news, he sent a telegram from Scotland to RKO Pictures congratulating them, saying: "I am deeply gratified that your company has such a good actress as Miss Kathleen Hepburn to play the role of Babbie."</p>
<p>The Scenery of Doune Made Her Reluctant to Leave Huimu</p>
<p>During the production of "Little Women," the most burdensome work that RKO Pictures felt was to build a Scottish village of Doune. Doune village was the name of the eighteenth century. It has now been changed to Killinmore village.</p>
<p>With the economic capabilities of a large company in Hollywood, this small Scottish village was actually created in the shade of the mountains of California. It is not only exactly the same as the Scottish rural style, but it is also a truly beautiful work of art. The authors are the general experts in Scottish-style architecture and landscape arrangement.</p>
<p>There is the lovely village of Doune, which is the former residence of Sir James Barrie, the original author of "Little Women." Behind it is the towering Lindores Abbey, which is built according to the ancient Norman-style fortress. The fortress has soaring roofs, stone walls, windows made of stained glass, magnificent iron gates, and towering stone steps.</p>
<p>Returning to the village, there is where the poor weavers live. There is the town hall, the public square, the blacksmith shop, old woman Nan's broken house, the church, and the "Little Minister's" residence.</p>
<p>There are also mountains. There are windmills on the mountains, and crowds of weavers at the foot of the mountains, and watchtowers used for observation, which can be used to raise their arms and shout when soldiers come to attack, and thousands of people will immediately stand up.</p>
<p>Among these many beautiful sceneries, this group of people, led by director Richard Wallace, are filming every day. Kathleen Hepburn, the star of "Little Women," is playing the Little Minister's lover here, wandering in this place every day. After "Little Minister" was finished, she was reluctant to leave. Because after months of getting along with such natural scenery, it has become her hometown.</p>
<p>Kathleen Hepburn, John Beal, and Alan Hale's Performances in "Little Minister"</p>
<p>One of the most touching scenes in "Little Minister." Nan (played by Elsie Gordon), an old woman who is nearing the end of her life, is about to be evicted by the landlord and sent to a nursing home. When Babbie (Kathleen Hepburn) comes, she quickly bears her living expenses and keeps her in her old residence. The old woman is extremely grateful and tearful.</p>
<p>Kathleen Hepburn's Self-Filmed Movie During the Production of "Little Minister" Si Qi</p>
<p>Ms. Kathleen Hepburn now has a huge collection of special and unusual films. This is because it was obtained from the big movie "Little Minister" she starred in.</p>
<p>When "Little Minister" was being produced, she used a handheld camera to film herself. When she was performing, she would ask her friends to film, and she would also ask people to record sound for her own film.</p>
<p>Since she is so happy about making movies, she has her own laboratory and sound movie equipment at home. She collects a special place for the "Little Minister" film, not just an extra set of films. But in the film, she took many actors, extras, herself and her friends, all of whom were taken into it. These are all completely absent from the official film.</p>
<p>On the way back after a disturbance, Babbie meets the Little Minister again. The bell that清越of the expression when they talk under the tree was finally found by them Dong Lu</p>
<p>The gentle and harmonious sound of bells from a small church in a picturesque Scottish place. In order to be authentic, RKO needed to find the sound of this bell to produce "Little Minister."</p>
<p>They tried all kinds of bells, no matter what form or size, but they could not find the bell sound that should be in the Oly little church in "Little Minister."</p>
<p>Mrs. Bessie, the director of the investigation department at RKO Pictures, finally visited Bishop Cantwell of the Catholic Church in Los Angeles and asked him if there was such a bell in the churches under his jurisdiction. As a result, he told Mrs. Bessie that there was such a bell in St. Victor's Church. After testing, they finally found the bell sound they wanted. With the bishop's permission, the sound department asked the bell that had been sought after the ends of the earth to capture its sound.</p>
<p>Silver Screen Tracking Literature "Little Minister" Forever Immortal Liusha</p>
<p>The most popular and enduring novel of the past fifty years—this is Sir James Barrie's immortal literary masterpiece "Little Minister."</p>
<p>Now RKO Pictures has brought this world-famous masterpiece to the screen, starring the talented actress Kathleen Hepburn, who is admired by everyone.

<h3 id="e102">Su Farmer's Bank: Launching Seedling Loans; Expanding Loan Amount by Four Million Yuan; Ordering All Branches to Implement Uniformly <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>Zhenjiang Correspondence: Jiangsu Provincial Farmer's Bank is the only rural relief organization in Jiangsu Province. The bank aims to regulate the rural economy to develop agricultural production. Therefore, since undertaking rural relief work, it has achieved significant results. According to the person in charge of the bank, all business operations are premised on serving rural areas. Thus, the bank can be said to assist farmers from the time of production to the time of harvest and marketing, resolving all production problems. The only thing to pay attention to is the preparation before production, which is seedling loans. General Manager Zhao attaches great importance to this loan program. Therefore, this year, the loan amount has been expanded to four million yuan, in order to achieve widespread relief and benefit every farmer. Currently, in view of the upcoming spring plowing season, the bank has already instructed all branches to start this loan program simultaneously. In order to regulate the use of loans, all loans before the harvest period, with the aim of predicting future production across the country (regardless of agricultural or sideline products), such as fertilizer loans, seed loans, agricultural tool loans, livestock loans, and oil loans, can be included as seedling loans. Regarding the procedures for applying for loans, when applying, borrowers must provide a detailed list of the number of acres cultivated, the types of crops, and the intended use of the loan. After approval by the bank, the principle is to issue physical goods. For example, for fertilizer or seed loans, fertilizer or seeds will be purchased and loaned to farmers, in order to prevent the loan from being used for other purposes. However, borrowers of this type of seedling loan must designate the harvested crops as preparation for repayment. The loan amount should not exceed 50% of the estimated harvest, and so on.</p>

<p>The Songjiang Red Cross Branch's shelter has successively sent five batches of disaster victims from Zhejiang. Chairman Zhou Xuewen went to Shanghai to contact the Railway Bureau to allocate cars for repatriation and requested the Zhejiang Relief Association to allocate rice, distributing one *dou* per person, with half for children. Yesterday (16th), more refugees from Zhejiang gathered in Songjiang from all over the countryside, totaling seven or eight hundred people. Chairman Zhou originally planned to close the shelter, but could not bear to leave the refugees unattended. He temporarily purchased steamed buns and distributed them by name. It is said that daily food expenses must reach over one hundred yuan. Mr. Zhou is diligently doing good deeds. Not only are the people of Zhejiang grateful, but wealthy families in Songjiang are also donating to help, in order to fulfill Mr. Zhou's purpose of disaster relief and caring for neighbors. Mr. Zhou will go to Shanghai tonight to request the Railway Bureau to allocate cars in order to carry out the sixth repatriation.</p>

<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Finance issued an order to Xu Cixuan, the County Magistrate of Jiading, stating that the report and proposal have been noted. Upon investigation, the outstanding provincial funds of over three thousand yuan owed by former County Magistrate Wu, after convening a local public organization meeting, recognized that the reasons for the losses were due to coping with special local circumstances, which is understandable. However, since former County Magistrate Wu did not submit account records for advances, the funds could not be verified by the provincial treasury. It is more appropriate to raise funds for local public use from local sources. It is ordered to further properly deliberate and find a way to consolidate and repay the funds from local surcharges in order to emphasize the provincial funds to conclude this situation. The proposal is temporarily retained. This order.</p>

<p>The county government believes that the treasury bonds in each district of this county have always been jointly managed by the local people who organize a management committee, and the "General Rules for the Management Committee of Treasury Bonds in Each District" were formulated and issued by former County Magistrate Pan. However, over time, the committee has not reorganized in accordance with the regulations for a long time and the use of funds has mostly not been approved. Although it was reorganized once last year, it still failed to fully rectify the situation. Therefore, the "Organizational and Management Regulations for the Treasury Bond Management Committee in Each District" have been specially formulated. Yesterday, each district head was specially instructed to quickly reorganize the original treasury bond management committee in the district completely before May 15th, and to instruct the former management committee to create a roster for handover and deposit the cash that had been embezzled into a designated bank.</p>

<h3 id="e108">Jiangsu Provincial Pawnshop Federation: Telegram Requesting Stamp Duty Exemption for Pawn Tickets <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Pawnshop Federation held a general meeting of member representatives of the province in Suzhou on the 10th of this month. The Wuxi Pawnshop Guild proposed that pawn tickets be exempt from stamp duty. After discussion, it was generally believed that pawn tickets with a loan amount of four yuan or more must be affixed with a one-cent stamp, in accordance with the provisions of Article 2 of the current Provisional Regulations on Stamp Duty. However, the newly revised Stamp Duty Law of the Legislative Yuan does not include pawn tickets as a document that should be subject to stamp duty, and its tax rate. This also demonstrates that the relationship between pawnshops and the poor has been considered, therefore, it has been liberally exempted. At this time of rural decline and difficulty in the pawnshop business, it is proposed to request the Ministry of Finance to issue a clear order to exempt the current regulations of Article 2 of the Provisional Regulations on Stamp Duty, which stipulate that pawn tickets must be affixed with a one-cent stamp, in advance, etc. The Pawnshop Federation telegraphed the Ministry of Finance yesterday requesting a prompt exemption in order to provide relief and care for the poor.</p>

There were police officers on duty every dozens of feet around the store. The robbers dared to openly rob and injure people, which was extremely audacious. Therefore, he specifically ordered the First Branch of the Public Security Bureau and the Detective Team in charge to solve the case within two weeks and offered a reward of seventy yuan for informants to conduct strict arrest. Meanwhile, detectives were dispatched to Shanghai and neighboring counties to investigate. Hong Houchang, the director of the First Branch, also offered a reward of fifty yuan, ordering strict arrest.

They carried guns and searched the house for more than an hour, only finding a little over ten taels of table salt. They claimed that Zhang was selling smuggled salt and detained Zhang at the team headquarters. They used torture to force a confession and extorted one hundred yuan. After Zhang repeatedly begged, the fine was reduced to sixty-five yuan before he was released. Also, in the home of Lu Jing San, a villager in Hehe Town South Village, the Fifth District, a small amount of table salt was taken from the kitchen by two tax police officers, who claimed that it was smuggled salt. As a result, he was fined over thirty yuan. Now, the people in the district, believing that the tax police are indiscriminately arresting good citizens and illegally extorting them, leaving the lives and property of the people unprotected, have jointly petitioned the county government and the Fourth District Headquarters of the Tax Police to quickly stop this behavior and send personnel to thoroughly investigate and deal with it.</p>

It is noted that the company's amendment of its articles of association has been approved by the competent authorities. In reality, the price remains two jiao per degree, with no price increase.

<h3 id="e123">Ministry of Finance: Clearly Orders Principles for Relieving Industry and Commerce; Stipulates Ten Standards for Loan Issuance <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>The Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications will raise 20 million yuan to relieve industry and commerce, of which 15 million yuan will be used for secured loans with collateral, and 5 million yuan will be used for guaranteed loans with credit. Because the Central Bank stipulates that it is not allowed to make mortgage and credit loans, and the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications stipulate that it is not allowed to make credit loans, now, for the purpose of relief, the Ministry of Finance has approved an exception. The Ministry order was issued yesterday. The Ministry order stipulating the standards for relieving industry and commerce is recorded below:</p>
<p>In order to facilitate the relief of industry and commerce, the Ministry has specially strengthened the financial resources of banks and has repeatedly issued separate orders to the Central Bank, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Shanghai Banking Association to discuss and develop concrete measures, and to implement loan issuance as soon as possible in accordance with the banks' articles of association. However, the nature of industrial and commercial firms in Shanghai is different, and the need for loan relief varies. Standards should be clearly defined to facilitate implementation. The principles for loan issuance are specially stipulated as follows: 1. When industry and commerce request loan relief, banks should make every effort to lend in order to maintain the market. 2. Requests for loan relief from industry and commerce are limited to factories that manufacture national goods, merchants that sell national goods, and those that transport national goods for export. 3. When a factory or merchant requests loan relief, the bank should verify whether the factory or merchant actually exists, and carefully investigate its assets and liabilities, profit and loss status, business policy, and whether the requested loan is necessary. 4. The bank should supervise and inspect the use of funds borrowed by factories or merchants at any time, and shall not be used for other purposes. 5. Factories or merchants that have been found to have no ability to continue to exist shall not request a loan. 6. Regarding technical improvements in factories and the business policies of merchants, the bank may send experts to guide or correct them at any time. 7. The monthly interest rate on bank loans to relieve industry and commerce shall not exceed eight li. If the factory or firm's situation cannot afford the full monthly interest, it may request the Ministry to approve a subsidy of two li per month. 8. The repayment period for the foregoing loans shall not exceed one year at the longest. The total amount of loans from each bank shall be limited to 15 million yuan, but after each loan, the bank shall report the details of the number of the loan recipients, the amount, the term, and the collateral to the Ministry for record. 9. For factories or firms that cannot provide collateral and are in urgent need of relief, if there are two reputable merchants who are jointly liable as guarantors for repayment, and the bank approves and requests a small loan, the bank should also provide a loan as appropriate to provide relief, but the total amount of the loan shall not exceed half of the factory or firm's capital and public reserve. The repayment period shall be in accordance with market practice and shall be paid at the end of the period. 10. The total amount of the foregoing credit small loans shall not exceed 5 million yuan in total for each bank loan. The above measures are intended to consolidate finance in the midst of relief, so as to take both into account. This order.</p>
<h3 id="e124">Foreign Banks Do Not Ship Silver Out; Financial Situation Becomes More Stable; No Need to Increase Equalization Tax Rate <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>A reporter from Xin Sheng She learned from foreign banks yesterday morning that all foreign banks, large and small, in Shanghai participated in the meeting of the Foreign Banks Association the other day. Cockburn (Chairman of the Foreign Banks Association), the deputy manager of the Mercantile Bank, first reported the meeting with Song Ziwen and solemnly stated that the Chinese government has decided not to prohibit the export of silver, abolish the silver standard, and reduce the fineness of silver coins. It can be guaranteed by credibility. However, since the overseas silver price is higher than the domestic price, the Chinese government is deeply concerned that silver will flow out again. It hopes that foreign banks will not ship silver out, and cooperate to maintain the market. It was unanimously agreed at the time to temporarily not load silver for export. All foreign banks will abide by it.</p>
<p>No Need to Increase Tax Rate</p>
<p>The equalization tax rate announced by the Foreign Exchange Equalization Committee every day at 10 a.m. can be used to cope with the high and low overseas silver prices. However, foreign banks in China have already agreed to temporarily not ship silver out, and customs offices have been ordered to strictly suppress smuggling, which has been quite effective. Moreover, the Chinese people have a deep understanding of the situation and accept the government's advice not to ship silver out. Therefore, China's silver reserves do not flow out due to the overseas silver price being higher than the domestic price. In fact, there is no need to increase the equalization tax rate. Moreover, an increase in the equalization tax will inevitably lead to a tightening of foreign exchange, which will affect the market. Therefore, the equalization tax rate has been the same for several days.</p>
<p>Foreign Exchange Equalization Tax Remains the Same</p>
<p>The equalization tax rate announced at 10 a.m. yesterday was 6.75 percent based on a rate of one shilling ten pence and one two five. As for the exchange rate for telegraphic transfers announced by the Central Bank today, one yuan per pound in London is one shilling seven pence six two five, one hundred yuan per U.S. dollar in New York is thirty-nine dollars six eight seven five, one hundred yuan per franc in Paris is sixty point one francs, and one hundred yuan per mark in Berlin is ninety-eight marks. The exchange rates for London, New York, and Berlin are the same as yesterday, except that the franc in Paris is one franc higher.</p>
