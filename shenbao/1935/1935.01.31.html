<p>㈡此三角洲由哈爾哈河决定國界言之、當然成爲滿洲國邻土上之地形變化、亦係國界綫哈爾哈本流之移動、然蒙兵則以哈爾哈河向東北移動、以爲此項三角洲乃外蒙之領土、而屯兵於此、</p>

<p>㈣蒙兵爲何而稱兵於此、蓋以哈爾哈河經過之地點、卽貝爾湖東北岸、乃冬季漁業有望之處、故侵入以圖利耳、今忽由滿洲國警備兵偶巡至此、發見蒙兵侵入情形、故發生此次之衝突事件也、（三十日日聯社電）</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>美參院否决加入世界法庭案恒</h3>
<p>據本月二十二日華盛頓電。謂美參院舉行秘密投票。贊成加入世界法庭者。有六十票。已過三分二之多數。頃據美電。此案正式投票結果。贊成票雖佔五二票。唯反對者亦有三六票。遂以不足三分二之多數而告失敗。爲時不到十日。而有若是之變化。殊出意外。且美國加入世界法庭一舉。自威爾遜而後。歷屆政治當局。不獨無所反對。且皆一致主張。如一九二三年二月十七日。美國務卿休士呈文哈定總統。卽主張加入。哈定接得休士呈文後。對於加入法庭。亦極贊同。故其轉致參院之咨文中。亦曾懇切請參院予以同意。再如一九二五年三月三日美國衆院之决議。亦謂苟有保留。美國不妨加入。翌年正月二十七日參院之决議。遂附有五種保留。及一九二九年之春。國務卿凱洛。與國聯方面交涉之結果。已使國聯方面對於美國之保留條件。無復異議。而同年九月四日美政府且訓令其駐瑞士之公使。致備忘錄於國聯秘書長。表示美國加入世界法庭之滿意基礎。已經建立。同年十一月十八日美國務卿史汀生呈文胡佛總統。亦謂美國簽字世界法庭約章與議定書之時機已告成熟。故是月二十六日胡佛卽令簽字。至一九三○年十二月十日。胡佛又咨文參院。催促同意。一九三二年三月。參院外交委員會之審查報告。對於美國加人世界法庭一舉。亦謂已無流弊。於此而觀。美國加入世界法庭一案。不論民主黨共和黨之總統或國務卿。無不贊同。卽衆參兩院。亦僅在提供保留條件。且美於世界法庭之約章與議定書。亦已簽字照理美國加入法庭之時機。已告成熟不謂至今仍遭否决。是誠大不可解之事也。</p>
<p>美國歷來反對加入世界法庭之理由。其要不外有三。㈠爲恐與國聯發生關係。㈡爲恐其干涉美國利益。㈢爲美非國聯會員國。對於選舉法官。恐在問題。然此三種困難。據記者所知。早已解决。例如第一種困難。休士於一九三二年呈文哈定時。卽謂「世界法庭約章之效力。並不因國聯之通過而發生。乃因各國之簽約而發生。」又謂「世界法庭。依其約章與議定書而成立。故爲一對國聯獨立之機關。且其行動。全依司法標凖。並不受國聯之友配。」觀此數語。卽知世界法庭與國聯。逈然不同。不能混爲一談。彰彰甚明。休士當時爲妥善計。更提一加入法庭之保留條件。謂「美國加入世界法庭。不得認爲對於國聯發生法理上之關係。」此條於一九二九年日内瓦法官委員會所擬之議定書予以承認。不能謂爲仍成問題。也至於干涉美國利益一項。亦極不成理由。蓋簽字議定書與接受約章。並不構成萬事須受法庭之支配也。蓋依照世界法庭約章第三十六欵之規定。法庭所受理者僅爲各國或國聯所提交之案件。其意卽謂有關各國若不願提交公斷。法庭决不相强。加之。一九二六年三月美參院對於休士提案。又附加二種保留。其一爲「美國對世界法庭約章與議定書之附議。得隨時撤回之。」其二爲「不得美國同意。法庭不得發表涉及美國利益之意見。」此二點皆爲一九二九年之世界法庭議定書所認可。對於美國利益之保全。可謂萬無一失。亦殊顯再如法官選舉之權利。國聯方面。及世界法庭約章簽约國。早經一致承認。且曾載入一九二九年之議定書。故美國參院前此所提加入法庭之重要保留條件。皆曾一一如願以償何以至今忽又打銷此案。此更使人莫明其妙。</p>
<p>我人前此曾謂。世界法庭之創建。與國際聯盟同爲美國政治家之理想。顧其靳於參加也。亦較任何國家爲甚。觀於今次參院之否决此案。可見美國雖爲一酷愛理想之國家。唯於事實上之利害。苟有不能恊調時。則任何偉大之理想。彼皆慨然捐棄掉首不顧也依我人猜度。美參院此次否决加入世界法庭一案之理由。與其反對加入國聯。並無稍異。美國之所以不欲加入國聯之最大原因。卽以今之國聯。實權操於英法二大集團。英則擁有國聯會員國之各自治領不難於國聯中形成一大勢力。法則有歐陸之凡爾賽集團。供其操縱。故亦不失爲一大勢力。至於美國。事實上並不擁有任何集團。一旦加入。勢必孤掌難鳴。受制於人。（蓋中美南美諸國忌美殊甚無可操縱也。）至其不願加入世界法庭之理由亦與此相類。蓋法官之選舉出自國聯則美雖參加。其勢必爲英法所制良以所選之法官旣屬於英法派者多。則美國自將處於失敗之地位也。此種感覺。以主張不問歐事之參議員爲甚。今次此案之不能通過於參院。其故或在是歟。</p>

<h3>美入世界法庭案遭參議院否决</h3>
<p>贊成票不足三分之二</p>
<p>羅斯福努力徒勞無功</p>
<p>日内瓦聞訊大爲驚異</p>
<p>（華盛頓）美國加入海牙國際法庭案、今日參院未予以批准、反對派獲大獲勝利、贊成加入者五十二票但不足三分之二之必要票數、因反對派有三十六票也、投票結果宣佈時、返對者大鼓掌、現悉贊成者民主黨四十三人、共和黨九人、反對者有民主黨三十人、共和黨十四人、共和黨今日聲稱、此案獲此結果、縱不永遠銷滅、亦必擱置多時、發起此案之參議員羅平生聲稱、此舉使美國加入國際法庭之問題、無期擱置、政府聞參院投票結果、甚以爲異、並認此事對於羅總統之希望予以重大之打擊、蓋羅總統前曾請國會爲和平計、批准此案、而一般人預料參院必表同意也、民主黨反對票達二十票之多、亦使人驚異、當此問題在最後辯論時、參院曾通過一條保留案、政府須先與任何對於努力談判一般的或特别的條約、俟無效時、始可提交國際法庭、（二十九日路透電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）參院今日已拒絶羅斯福總統所提議之美國參加世界法庭案、參院書記官宣而表决票數、計爲五十二對三十六、去批准條約所需三分之二多數不足七票、其時旁聽席上毫無隙地、聞此報告、歡聲雷動、幾使參院議長賈爾納無法維持秩序、該案之結果如此、大半係赫斯德系報紙及考格林神父之無綫電播音宣傳所致、</p>
<p>參議員無日不獲函電千通要求投票反對、據稱全國各地發來之此項函電、總數在七萬五千以上、反對派領袖仍爲一九二○年反對前總統威爾遜提議參加國聯之小團體、卽波拉及約翰遜等之號稱頑固派者、政府派領袖羅炳生於否决之後、卽稱「世界法庭案現已壽終正寢矣」、按該案提出之後、反對派雖指爲參加國聯之捷徑、然預料參院當能順從總統之意旨也、且歷次修正案皆被否决、而約翰遜亦提出修正、謂世界法庭處理美國與他國間之爭端應以原有條約爲根據、政府因恐過於堅持、致招失敗、業已表示接受故在最後表决之前、實未料有此結果、羅炳生謂失敗之原因、大半係受考格林神父所組織之社會正義團宣傳之影響、波拉則稱、參院否决此案係世界和平之勝利、因世界法庭旣不能處理德奥之爭、實於美國及世界和平大有危險也云、觀察者以爲羅斯福總統對於該案並未親自努力、故期失望亦屬微幾云、（二十九日國民電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）此次參院投票結果、在主張與歐洲分離之一派、固屬極大之成功、蓋羅斯福總統種種努力、不特全功盡棄、且加入國際法院一事、雖爲美國歷屆政府所要求、今又將束之高閣矣、抑美國若干人士從事一種運動、謀使美國加入國聯會、今加入國際法院尙且不能通過、則加入國聯會之運動、自將從此打銷矣、按參院中反對加入國際法院最力者、爲共和黨參議員波拉與瓊森兩人、此兩人反對加入之理由、謂海牙國際法院、附隸於國聯會之下、美國加入國際法院、乃係一種遮眼法、欲藉以凖備美國加入國聯會、且美國如加入國際法院、則勢必牽入歐洲各國爭攘之漩渦、苟然則美國徒成歐洲國家之工具、對於國際事件、反失其自由判斷之權云、又此次參院討論加入國際法院案時、全國引起一種猛烈之運動、而以赫斯脫系報紙爲尤甚、最近數日來、參議院中態度猶豫之議員、接得各處來電、表示反對加入國際法院者、多至四萬餘起、今日投票後、贊成該案之民主黨多數派參議員領袖勞平生宣稱、此次參院之决定、將使美國加入國際法院之問題、擱置至無限時期、不能再提云、按勞平生在參院舉行投票前、猶作最後之呼籲、謂近日全國各處有人鼓動反對加入國際法院、冀影響參院之决議、實屬不當、反對者謂美國加入足以危害美國公民之生命財產、且使美國牽入歐洲之爭攘、此種理由全屬虛僞云、勞平生雖竭力辯護、然參院仍否决該案、則實非一般人意料所及也、（二十九日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）日内瓦聞美參院不批准美國加入世界法庭之消息、大爲詫異、蓋國聯方面向以爲參院三分二多數之批准、必成事實也、今參院有此不利之裁决、誠爲國聯之大不幸、然亦無益於美國、運動美國加入國聯之努力、現遭重大打擊、羅總統對於此事、尙未表示意思、前充國際法庭推事之貝克氏今日聲稱、贊成加入者必須繼續其宣傳、迨多得七票時而後止、衆議員費士素主張加入國際法庭者、現表示意見、謂美國輿情因歐洲諸國拒付戰債、致生變化云、（三十日略透電）</p>
<h3>英法談話卽將開始歐洲大局作總檢討</h3>
<p>特别側重軍縮問題</p>
<p>安全立塲英法互異</p>
<p>（倫敦）英國内閣要員與法總理佛蘭亭外長賴伐爾、將於星期五日在倫敦開始談話、據此間消息靈通各界預料、英國對亽歐陸事務、不致更受拘束、聞談話將爲對歐洲大局作一般檢討性質、且將特别注意軍縮、英國固願竭力輔助以解决歐洲目前之困難、但對於歐洲之約束事件、無脫離其傳統的立塲之徴象、故似决不致確認洛迦諾公約、而僅將許諾於法國受他國攻擊時、以空軍出援之、法外長賴伐爾昨日爲衆院所迫、宣述倫敦談話之法國立塲、謂總理佛蘭亭與渠必將討論德國軍備問題、與吾人所懷抱之國際策畫、和平而無安全之保障、則無實現之可言、吾人深知法國之安全、實爲歐洲所必要、國會於此、可信任吾人云、（三十日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）法國總理已兩年餘未蒞倫敦、查一九三二年十月赫禮歐曾怱遽來此、討論因德國對海上軍縮會議態度所引起之局勢、此後法總理遂無至者、外交界現謂法英固願恢復國際信任、但兩國之意見實上歧異、英國抱縮减軍備之志願、希望邀德國返至日内瓦、而使一九三二年十二月所成立之五國公約得發生效力、按該約允依規定各國安全之制度予德國以平等權利、法國則恐德國數年之内將不可制、故堅主德國須先返日内瓦、而後始可討論平等、並須獲法國安全之絶對保障、及保證國際統制軍備、而又須德國亦加入關於奥國獨立與東歐安全之公約、如德國拒絶、則法國將與蘇俄及捷克締結防衛公約云、（三十日路透電）</p>
<h3>法國安全計畫包含三主要點</h3>
<p>（倫敦）半官方面人士對於法國總理佛蘭亭外長賴伐爾來倫敦時、法國所提出之最少限度安全保障計畫、甚感興味、聞此項安全保障計畫、其中最主要者共有三點、</p>
<p>㈠德國重行加入國聯會、並參加各項區域互助公約、㈡法德兩國軍力、應保持足以保障安全之相當差度、㈢英國應積極恊助、以維持秩序、</p>
<p>據一般人傳聞、關於第一點、如德國要求必須將互助公約、改爲諮詢及不侵犯公約之方式、方可加以簽訂、則蘇聯及小恊商各國勢必拒絶、解决極爲困難、此層當加以考慮、關於第三點、則因英國各自治領不加贊同、故英國大約將僅在現有各項約束、如國聯會盟約及羅加諾條約之範圍内成立恊定云、（廿九哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>英提出新建議傳統立塲不變</h3>
<p>（倫敦）據自由黨機關報「星報」載稱、英國政府關於安全問題、似已向法國提出一種新建議、英國主張安全問題、德國重整軍備問題、及國際和平保障問題、三者應同時提出討論、同時加以解决、據「星報」所稱、英國提議三點如下、</p>
<p>㈠英國重申在羅加諾條約中英國所負但之義務、並允許英國以空軍恊助、履行此項義務、㈡英國在原則上參加羅馬恊定、於奥國獨立遭外來桱威脅時、英國當參加相互諮詢、㈢英國參加集體保障制度、以增强現所考慮軍備限制恊定之效力、（二十九日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>賴伐爾宣佈法國外交政策</h3>
<p>願參加穩定中之歐和平組織</p>
<p>安全保障爲今後努力的目標</p>
<p>（巴黎）本日衆議院開會時、外長賴伐爾答覆議員質問、發表重要之外交演說、緣有國家主義派議員蒲伊雄向外長提出質問、謂「吾人固能希望以相當之讓步、使德國裁减軍備否乎、法國於一九三四年四月十八日致英國之軍縮問題覆文、已表示法國立塲、不承認德國重整軍備爲合法之行動、然就目前情形、深恐法國將被迫放棄其安全主張、與曩日被迫放棄賠償要求時相同、苟然、則英國又將如何周旋其間、以使德國重作諾言而實踐之乎」、至是外長賴伐爾乃加以答覆、謂「英法兩國對於各項歐洲政策、每隔相當時間、必相互交換意見、此爲人人所欣幸者英法交換意見、其目標不必固定、視環境變化而定、大槪德國軍備問題、及兩國負有約束之一切國際行動、均當在討論之列、吾人具有實際之感覺、吾人深明吾國國防之需要、蓋歷史已昭示吾人、法國如軟弱無能、則不能爲友邦所重視、法國如孤立無援、亦未必有裨於和平、吾人願參加穩定之中歐和平組織、吾人不信無各國相互之安全保障而可獲得和平、因此此種安全保障、實爲吾人努力之主要目標、最近數星期以來、法國外交積極活動、爲自來所希見、因此現已造成一種空氣、各國間有漸臻妥恊之趨勢、法國傳統政策所企求者、亦唯此而已、羅馬恊定使法意兩大民族結成鞏固持久之友誼、倫敦談話復將使英法兩大國作密切友好之團結、吾人深知法國安全、爲維持歐洲和平所絶對必需、然法國亦始終凖備對於鞏固和平之一切國際企圖、作公允有效之贊助、此節不僅吾人知之、抑且爲外國人士之所周知」云云、賴伐爾演說畢、全塲大鼓掌、議員蒲伊雄發言、表示滿意、當卽聲請撤回質問案、俟英法倫敦談判後、賴伐爾報告談話結果時、再行提出質問、惟謂法國外交政策、仍當以反對修改和約爲主、務請政府勿忘云云、（二十九日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>德國社黨秉政二週記念</h3>
<p>希特勒發表宣言</p>
<p>（柏林）今日爲國社黨秉政之第二週年紀念日、希特勒發表宣言、謂世界大戰之發作、爲歷史上之轉變點、國社主義之誕生、亦爲一轉變點、無數兆之德人、現爲此新主義馳驅、而發生前年罕見之大規模人類力量之動員、如渠前曾請以四年時期實行其所定之程序、則渠敢謂未及此時期之半、而所許約之各節、已試行逾三分之二、反對吾人者已覺吾人已將彼等所期望者見諸實施、卽榮譽自由幸福的德國是也、希氏末謂薩爾適於此時重歸祖國、故今日之紀念、堪稱歡樂禮云、（三十日路透電）</p>

<p>（柏林）内閣今日通過三項重要法令、規定薩爾臨時行政·薩爾出席德國會之代表·及德國地方總督之地位、第一法令將一九三三年十一月所選舉之國會增加議員八名、薩爾人民投票贊成歸德者每六萬人出議員一人、議員八名槪須由薩爾專員布克爾呈請希特勒元首任命、第二法令規定薩爾成爲德國二十省之一之前、薩爾行政暫由希特勒元首所委之專員主持、該專員代表德政府管轄一切庶政、其職權與德國地方總督相同、第三法令給予德國地方總督以特别大權、卽彼等在轄境内爲行政長官、亦爲立法者、僅受中央政府及聯邦國會之節制、以施行元首之政策爲其任務、賦有發佈臨時命令之權、中央政府各部長於與内政部長之監督與統制上不衝突處、槪直接向地方總督發號施令、地方總督任免之權操諸元首、可由元首委之兼任邦長、各邦政府官員由總督向元首建設任免之、總督轄境亦由元首釐定、普魯士總督之職權由元首自兼、但可交由普魯士總理署理、戈林現卽普魯總督、據上項法令之所規定、德國各邦政府之權力大加限制、而德國憲法又經過一重要修正矣、（二十九日國民電）</p>
<p>（柏林）經濟部長許密德今日辭職、希特勒核准第、卽委德意志銀行總裁沙赫德署理經濟部長之職、許密德辭職原因聞係健康問題、當數月前彼請病假之時、外間卽傳其不能回任云、（三十日國民電）</p>

<p>（華盛頓）美國特使台維斯今日在國際恊會演說、仍信海軍新約有成立之望、惟對日本之廢止華盛頓海軍條約、表示遺憾、台氏力稱美國素抱睦鄰政策、固尊重各國權利也、各國苟不漠視美國參加之條約或侵犯吾人之權益、則可不懼吾人將歧視云、台氏並稱、裁軍之宗旨在於促進互信之心安全感、及遏止侵略之行、台氏預告國際裁軍運動不久復將在日内瓦發動、並讚美華盛頓會議之效力、台氏又稱、與日本及其他大海軍國合作爲維持和平之要素、吾人毌須因目前之僵局及海軍競爭之流言而不安、一九三七年之元旦行見新恊定之成立、台氏最後稱、遠東問題爲關係各國之共同問題云、（二十九日國民電）</p>
<h3>暹邏易君之謠</h3>
<p>新加坡　今日此間得悉暹邏王姪阿南大馬希獨爾親王已被推爲暹邏王、新君年十一齡現居洛桑、舊王則旅英倫、其復位條約未能爲暹邏政府接受、因有此舉、君冲齡、將由攝政治理國事、暹邏遜君前與盤谷政府政見不合、憤而宣告通位、盤谷政府特派代表赴英倫勸王歸位、在拿爾地方會議兩小時之久、無結果而散、暹政府代表團遂電向盤谷請示、以定進退、暹政府遂决定更易國君云、（卅日國民電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）暹邏政府派在此與暹王會議之代表、今日特向美聯社記者宣稱、新加坡所傳暹邏更易新君之說、一無根據、並謂暹王與盤谷政府之談判仍在進行中、暹王對於遜位與否尙未决定云、（卅日國民電）</p>

<h3>李石曾昨日遊歐歸來</h3>
<p>暢談國際對華形勢</p>
<p>大戰發生與否難料</p>
<p>中委李石曾氏、於去年八月間赴歐考察、並辦理增進中法文化等事宜、離國已將半載、茲已公畢、於昨晨搭乘法郵船瓊雪沙號輪抵滬、李氏親友、均赴輪埠歡迎、李氏登陸後、卽返福開森路世界學社休息、各報社記者、謁之於寓次、當承見告赴歡任務及世界大勢甚詳、茲爲公誌如下、</p>
<p>赴歐任務　首據李氏稱、本人離國已將半載、其大部份時間、係逗留於日内瓦·巴黎·里昂·等處、除視察我國國際圖書館及中法大學等文化機關外、並接洽中法文化上各種合作辦法、同時復出席國際間文化及學術團體之各種會議、以期增進中國與國際之友誼、過去本人亦每年出國、卽係此項工作、本年六月間、照例亦須赴法、惟屆時是否能有暇成行、則現尙不能預定耳、</p>
<p>歐歐洲現狀　歐洲政局現狀、據本人在日内瓦時所得觀感、當德日相繼脫退國際聯盟時、歐洲各國間政治狀况、確曾一度呈緊張狀態、以後蘇聯加入聯盟成功、形勢卽稍和緩聯盟基礎、重得相當保障、而尤以對於薩爾問題之處置得當、增加信譽不少、近來美國對國聯態度亦頗接近、雖未正式加入、但對於歐洲和局、業有若干相當助力、至於世界大戰、是否於最近在歐洲發生之可能、現尙難說、惟在本人登輪時、正當薩爾問題最緊張之際、現薩爾旣已和平解决、此種危機、是否業已消滅、或仍潛伏内部、則爲値得注意之一事耳、</p>
<p>國際形勢　此外國際癎對華形勢、除少數具有特殊情形、而别抱侵略野心者外、其餘均對我保持良好之同情、在國際聯盟中之會員國家、亦屬如此、國聯對中日問題及不承認僞滿事件、現仍一貫主張、保守原來態度、與以前未有任何變動也云云、</p>
<p>明後晉京　李氏以去國已久、公私諸務、亟待料理、故在滬略息卽將晋京、與汪行政院長、蔣軍事委員長、及回國斡旋時局之中監委王寵惠等會晤、報告此次歐遊觀感、及探討國内政局大勢云、</p>

<h3>電話局於總結賬期内員工加班工作</h3>

年可以落成。　　在市中心大醫院動工的那一年，公立上海醫院和中國公立醫院都收歸了市辦，屬於市衛生局，後者且改名爲「市立傳染病醫院」，又改造了爲隔離上適用的院舍。徴稿新例　　一　·來稿愈短愈妙，至多四百字。其分類特載稿件如「拉雜話」「遊踪所至」等等，亦不得超過九百字。長稿不收。　　二·來稿必須加蓋圖章，方可領酬，無圖章者，作却酬論。　　三·來稿無論用否，槪不退還，如附有寫就姓名地址及黏足郵票之信封者，不在此例。　　四·來稿須用中國紙張及中國毛筆繕寫，以重國貨。　　五·圖畫並不限於諷刺時事之作，凡滑稽畫遊戲畫以及有趣味之照片等，均所歡迎。形式作正方，務請注意。救命小常識醋的作用  靑雲　　因着醋的滋味，是酸溜溜的，於是男女間發生酸溜溜的酸化問題，就把「吃醋」兩字來作代表。至今這「吃醋」兩字，在男女間，佔着絶大勢力。其實醋除了調味之外，還有不少用途。在藥物上，可以做鹹性的調和劑。在實用方面，也有不少用處：烹飪方面，煮牛肉或番茄時，略加些醋，就容易煮熟，並且不留醋味；滾蛋加醋少許，可以不致發黃。生肉一塗着淡醋，查以保住新鮮。瓷器和玻璃的器皿，在加着醋的滾水内，預先浸洗一回，可以經久耐用。煤油燈中的燈心。用醋浸過後晒乾，；點燃時候，不但可减少煤烟，並且火焰光明。此外溶膠水時，稍微加醋，可以久藏不壞。衣服上的顏料斑和果汁斑，用布蘸着醋，細細揩拭，可以慢慢拭去，至於衣服上發生黴點，用醋鹽混和的水揩拭，也可揩　去的。此外身上的疣痣，每日點濃醋數次，也就會自行剝落的，那酸溜溜的醋，用途眞多着哩！　　果品的醫學　　西方俗諺：有「飯後一蘋果，醫生無處用」一句話，蘋果在我國書籍上，呌做「林檎」，可以醫治痢疾；治法將蘋果弄去皮核，煮成粉末，就是，西藥治痢要藥蘋果粉。此外果品可作藥物用的，還有多種。現在且摘錄幾種在下面：葡萄富於鐵質，所以葡萄乾可以堅齒健胃，葡萄汁可以補血强身。梨生吃清心潤肺，煎成蜜梨，可治熱咳，痰喘，清喉，降血，是最普通的治咳丹方。藕煮熟吃汁，可治咳嗽及吐血症。藕節是藥物中的通氣要藥。山楂爲消食要藥，西藥中的消食片，就是山楂製的。楊梅浸酒，年代越陳，治浰越有效騐。在這天寒生着火爐的時候，人們的咽喉，每易烘火，發生漲痛，假使每天吃幾　文旦，或一隻橘子，幾顆橄欖，就可解火止痛，百病全消。橄欖打汁，可以解河䐁毒；或魚骨梗。此外柿子的潤腸清肺，枇杷的潤肺消痰，都是很有效騐的果品　　銀幣的種類　　這一次蔣仲川先生的銀幣展覽，確給蘇州人增進常識不少。會中展覽的銀幣，除了歐美各國的銀元銀角，我國銀幣，也有蒙古，東三省，新疆，和本部十八行省，大大小小，不下一千四百餘種。我國自製銀幣，在道光開始，叫做「銀餅」，在銀幣中央，刻着餉銀一兩或五錢的名稱；所以銀幣來華的時代，定在道光年間，那時的銀元叫做「洋塌餅」和以前郵票稱做「龍頭」一般哩。銀幣中以道光結婚紀念銀幣，最有價値，據說那兩枚鐫着帝后圖像的銀幣，代價竟達六百元呢。慈禧和洪憲的銀幣，一個旗裝，一個皇冕，也是不易得見的。銀幣中民國元老刻着銀幣的，除先總理中山先生外，有袁世凱，黎元洪，徐世昌，曹錕，黃興，唐繼堯等，那倪嗣冲和蕭耀南，也各有銀幣行世的　　梅蘭竹菊的種類　　梅蘭竹菊，雖然種類不同，形態各異，然而在我國人眼中，公認爲四大花木。梅是木本植物，有紅梅，白梅，重瓣三種，除重瓣不結子外，紅白梅都會累累結子的。梅樹凌寒著花，所以在開花當兒並無一片葉兒，滿樹花朶，眞有香雪如海的大觀，這是梅獨有的特性奇態。蘭，共有蘭，蕙，建蘭三種，分春夏二季開花，建蘭的葉子，比較特别闊大些，蘭花花瓣，以圓厚爲名貴，有梅瓣等等名稱。竹，除了普通的毛竹外，還有湘妃竹，紫竹，慈孝竹，文竹等等。湘妃竹竹上有着斑痕，紫竹竹身極細，作紫色。慈孝竹，葉梗都細，可治咳嗽。文竹一物，種在盆裏，蓬蓬鬆鬆的，是很好的案頭供品。菊花的種類，是花中最繁的了。禮記上說「餐秋菊之落英」，落英兩字，確是初放花瓣的解釋，因爲菊花的花瓣，不會落下的啊！</p>

<p>自由談牢騷也罷  孟加　　文學之成爲商品，旣成定論。然而這也冒凟不了誰，商品有好有壞，有奢侈品（化裝品）也有生活必需品，然而不管什麽品，一切的存在都有牠存在的理由！也卽所謂社會根據在。就是「毒藥」也如是丨因爲事實上也仍有一些人，需要自殺或被殺的原故。那些挿着使人一見「飄飄然」的圖畫的軟性刋物之所以不死，也决不是偶然的。西禾先生希望這些人「改行」，做個皮鞋匠或屠户，這自然是對的，不過，也許爲的西禾先生對於生活太隔膜，所以不大高明就是了。這年頭，「吃飯難」已成不景氣底一大旗幟，「拿得輕，負得重」的「粗」人，尙且免不了餓肚子，呌這些文弱的書生或洋塲遺少去幹嗎？這是一想就透的。　　玩弄文字魔術，拿新技巧騙飯吃，尋章摘句，摛掞詞藻」這也許眞的是「厚顏」，然而因此便呌他們去做皮鞋匠，做屠户，也總不嫌其來得太兀突，太急進。因爲要是「屠户」眞可爲而能爲，從事於這種職業也就怕太多，終也免不掉有此人們被擠回文壇來的。　　西禾先生以爲「一個眞眞懂得生活的人，他是不去舞文弄墨來寫那白紙黑字的書的，他是蔑棄一切細碎的活動，而用整個的生命去寫『歷史』那部大書的」。這種「從大處着眼」的態度，實在令人拜服，而像這樣的「英雄」也實在偉大；不過，眞能這樣的也就只有那些「眞懂得生活」的人們，而不但懂得生活，而且無辦法生活的呢，横豎也就總得舞弄起文墨來的。我也看見了不少的文學的從業者就是這麽幹起來的。　　一切都可以想得透，只有丨丨　　西禾先生那樣一頭承認文學是組織生活的手段，而「能給社會以頗大的影響」一頭却又要求那些嚴肅寫作的人們除了「寫作」外，再做出些「什麽」來，這才是敎人「丈八金剛，摸不着頭腦」呢。夢  任白戈　　每個人都有他自已的夢。在惡劣的現境中，没有夢大約是不大容易活得下去的。諺云：「一年之計在於春」，這就使得人們在每個新年初上的春光裏做出許多的夢。前幾天，有些報紙上不是已經明明白白地載着許多大人和小孩的夢嗎？　　兩年前，「東方雜誌」也曾載過許多要人和名人的夢，而且還是特别請求做出來的。但那成績並不怎樣好，主要的就是竟没有什麽可以令人安眠的好夢。自然，其中亦間或有一點近乎這一類的好夢的，例如希望全上海的人都有抽水馬桶坐等之，然而好夢，儘管是好夢，結果還不是一個夢嗎？我相信，前幾天那些報紙上所載的許多好夢，將來依然會是一個夢的。　　「日有所思，夜有所夢，」這是一般人對於夢的一個粗淺的解釋。除了相信夢是神靈所寄託的那些人們以外，恐怕誰都不能否認夢與現境的因緣吧。夢時常總在現境之中打滾，現境太惡劣了，自然好夢也就不可多得。但人們却偏要張着眼睛做出許多好夢。　　夢是可以由人做的，但不一定都能做出好夢。要一定做出好夢，便非張着眼睛不可，否則反而會做出惡夢也不一定。張着眼睛做夢，實在是一件苦事。首先就難於做出，這自然是一個問題，卽使做出了，而且是好夢，但人們究竟是不適於張着眼睛做夢的。連做夢也成了一件苦事，這應該是許多人在惡劣的現境中所共同體味着的吧。　　在我們鄉間，一般人就一年一度地要正式體味着這一件苦了。每逢除夕那一夜，大家便燒着木柴，圍在一團談天，說吉利話，一直到新年的元旦。這呌做「守歲」，主意是在避免做惡夢。據說，這一夜做出的夢是最有效騐的，做出好夢自然很好，如果做出惡夢便要倒楣一年。他們記得自已時常總是惡夢多而好夢少，所以爲了避免惡夢竟連好夢也不敢做了。但我希望他們現在能够張着眼睛做出許多好夢。　　能够張着眼睛做出許多好夢的人，現在到並不少。不過，這中間却有一個區别，許多好夢都專門是爲了别人做出的。自然張着眼睛做出一些好夢也是可以的。自然我們也不但希望能够自已張着眼睛做出許多夢，而且希望能够於安眠中做出許多好夢。這就是說，我們根本須得一個可以令人做出許多好夢的現境，接着的問題便應該是怎樣使我們的希望還不至於是一個夢。失眠症  臧克家　　人生到處受着磨難，疾病便是一種。好似老天爲了呌人知道「健時仙」的滋味因而降下了疾病。千種萬種的病症當中，失眠算得是最普通最流行的了。牠是不分貧富，無間今古的。只要一個人他知道愁知道憂，腦子不至像一塊頑石，那麽失眠的况味大約不會嘗不到的。　　兒時聽過一個宰相失眠的故事，至今還没有忘記。因爲當時有點痛恨那不講情理的宰相而替他的僮子抱不平，所以印象很深。　　宰相每夜睡不好，次日清晨照例在他的侍僮身上尋事。不是說他伸的鋪不好，就是駡他掃得鋪不乾凈。僮子含着寃，加心的在鋪床疊被上用工夫。可是宰相的責駡還是照例，因爲每早他從鋪上尋出一條小綫毛來。後來宰相下野變爲平民，一個夏日裏他在樹蔭底下鋪着一領破蓑衣睡覺，螞蟻把他的臉當了過橋，然而他睡得呼呼的響。這情况適被他以前的侍僮遇見了，不禁心中大駡，駡他失眠是呌官燒的。不消說「無官一身輕」的道理是没法向一個頑僮講的。　　于今，在這世季末的氣氛裏更適於失眠症的繁衍，引起失眠的動機雖然不同，而在夜裏想找到一種寗靜的睡眠是不容易的了。　　都會是「不夜之城」，人也是「不夜的腦子」。愛神的影子；頭彩五十萬：洋樓，汽車，鑽石戒指，···一口說不完的這一切一切，好似一隻金蝴蝶，牠的翅膀扇得多少有閒人「幾千遍搗枕捶床」。另外一些窮人都會裏和鄉村裏的，他們的腦子雖不會夢想天開，然而壓在心上的生活的擔子也會攪得他們坐不安睡不寗的。　　目前的世界是一個緊張的世界，是一個失眠症流行的世界！　　如果現今還有所謂宰相的話，那他一定不會再是那樣的傻，一個心「夙夜在公」，弄得睡不着覺反而怨人掃鋪掃得不乾凈。常自已問自已，目下也有爲東北四省的失陷失眼，爲華北失眠，爲國家的前途失眠的嗎？失眠我想一定是有的，爲了什麽？那怕只有天知道！今天，對於那個傻宰相由恨變爲愛，對於那頑童的無知反而覺得可笑了。「永勞永逸」與「不勞不逸」  梅君毅　　在「自由談」上看了王平陵先生一篇「永勞永逸」的大作之後，使我不覺嚇了一跳，這不啻彷彿向失業者讀了一道宣告死刑的判文似的。　　王先生的意思是說：失業者之失業，并非社會對於他們的「不是」，乃係他們自身無能爲力底結果（？）　　所以，王先生對這問題，作了這樣的一個解釋：　　「我覺得世界上祇有能够貢獻社會所需要的能力的人類，方能得着社會所給予的應得的生存的權利·····」　　那麽没有能够負獻社會所需要的能力的人類，自然得不到社會所給予的應得的生存的權利了。　　可是事實上并不是「這樣」的。先有了「人類」，然後才產生「社會」的。「人」是「社會」的組織者，主持者。社會不過是人與人之間的一種關係底形式而已。所以「人類」并不是如「社會」而生存以是爲着人類自已生活着。　　倘「社會」的機構發生了缺陷的時候，則諸種的「社會問題」自必會隨之以來了。　　「失業問題」是這些問題中之一底「嚴重問題」。「平心言之，這實在是一個不易解决的問題。」在整個社會不良的制度還没有得到具體解决以前，這失業問題也無法解决的。我相信這是人人所不能否認的事實罷。　　所以「問題」不在「人類的能力」上面而在於「社會的體系」上面，我想這大柢不會錯誤吧。　　然而，王先生却巧妙地給予人們的一種說法：　　「從根本上觀察；社會因爲文化的繼續的堆積，形成不斷的進展，人類都有發展其天才，能力，推動社會走向進化的義務：同時，社會就有給予相當的生存的權利。因此，便發生下列三個問題：㈠你是否具備了充分的能力？㈡社會最需要的那一些能力？㈢是否繼續增長你的能力？」　　基於這三「問題」，得了王先生自已意思的回答：Ａ你具備了充分的能力（一點兒是不行的）是不會失業的。Ｂ你懂得社會需要的那一種能力（然而社會所需要於人的能力是多樣的）是不會失業的。Ｃ你繼續增進了你的能力（有時增進了也無法）是不會失業的。　　根據於這些「問答」，王先生就是說說没有能力的人類就没有給予他所生存的權利。　　可是在過去，在目前，有許多具着豐富學識經騐，能力才幹的專家，學者，優秀的智識份子們，他們一樣地受眘失業的壓迫。有許多刻苦耐勞的工人一樣地受着失業的恐慌，有許多辛勤的店員，職員，敎員等一樣地受着失業的苦痛。　　饑寒使人們已陷無涯慘痛的深淵裏，空間和無聊，不是已經喪失人們無限的「天才」「能力」嗎？　　所以，人們不是不願意貢獻能力於社會（他們時時刻刻都在找着工作）而是「社會」没有給予他們工作的可能與機會呵！　　因此，爲了獲得人類應該的生存必須「共同推動社會的整個的發展，就要繼續的生存，繼續的勇敢的奮鬥以求生存，而不是在勞苦中掙扎。　　所以（正如王先生所說）世界上决没有「一勞永逸的事！」也不是現在的「祇有永遠勞苦的人，方能永遠安逸！」　　在此刻，在現社會的畸形狀態裏頭，有一種人永遠的勞苦而永遠的得不到安逸的。有一種人永遠不勞苦而永遠得到安逸的；還有一種人不能勞苦也不能安逸！　　王先生以爲然乎？　　至於這嚴重的失業問題，「在未成爲問題之先（該怎樣）提前注意，設法避免」？「到了成爲問題以後，就變成僵局無法解决了」的時候應該怎樣去解决？王先生可否給予失業者一個意見？　　雖然王先生諄諄的告誡人們：「」·········有些人以爲祇許吃着一次苦········便終生受用不盡了，社會應該給予永遠的生存的權利了，這是一個嚴重的錯誤·······有些人僅憑着祇能試用一年的能力，便期望着得着一生的生存的報酬，這是一個非分的徼倖。如果，社會上能把那些嚴重的「錯誤」！以及非分的「徼倖」，逐漸减少丨丨少到等於零，我相信這帶有嚴重性的「失業問題」，也許可以解决一部份。」　　但這祇是「一部份」而已。然這「一部份」是否因爲减少了他們一部份人底夢想「一勞永逸」以獲得「一部份」「失業問題」的解决尙屬疑問？　　所以我覺得現在縱使是「永勞」也不能「永逸」！未卜王先生以爲如何！吃飯（三）  周文　　眞想不到他今天竟有這麽一着。　　要不是吃飯號吹了起來，我們也許還在人叢中追趕。現在究竟吃飯比抽烟要緊，而且隊長已經走出來了。　　「你們在幹甚麽！」　　隊長無論遇着甚麽，老是這麽喊，這好像符咒似的，我們就趕快鑽進列子裏面去。　　大家一把列子站好，自然又是「立正」，「向右看前」，「報數」，這地方倒不錯，出操自然關心着我們，就是吃飯也這麽關心，生怕少了一個人吃飯似的，其實我們誰都餓得垂涎三尺了。　　天地間吃飯的規矩恐怕只有我們的最大。「報數」之後，就「稍息」等着，靜聽着値星四伍四伍的喊去。當他喊出「右四伍」的時候，站在排頭的八個人就把支出去的右脚一斬齊地收回來，立一下正，才走上食堂去。把飯裝好，擺在自已的坐位前，看着。這時候，在列子後面的我們恨不得擠在前面去，眞是覺得他們長得高的人太估便宜了。好容易八個八個的走完，擠滿了食堂的坐位時，那在操塲上跳空了的肚子現在就要把牠塡平了。我們都垂着乎望着値星的眼睛。先前大家都似乎餓得有些倒跟破敗的樣子，然而現在却一個個都聚精會神。値星左右看看，見一排排無聲而勇敢眼睛。　　「起立！」他居然喊了。　　大家一斬齊地對着飯盌都站了起來，好像誰按了一下機關似的。幾十排的人面對面地夾着桌子，讓飯的蒸氣從下巴下蒸騰上來，好像故意地開着玩笑。　　「坐下！」　　一斬齊的頭都矮了下去，馬上就聽見一斬齊的屁股坐上條凳的聲音。在這剛剛坐下的時候，我就看見我對面那個同學的眼睛搶先就望着那菜盌中浮在上面的一塊肉皮子了。　　「開動！」　　這一聲喊來，說時遲，那時快，我才抓着筷子，那菜盌中的一塊皮子却早被我旁邊的一個同學夾進大大的嘴巴去。對面那同學似乎很失望，怔了一下眼睛，可是旁邊這同學已拈了第二筷，他於是也不得不把筷子猛伸進菜盌去。我們的吃飯似乎有些兒特别，盌擱在嘴邊，儘讓筷子在菜盌與嘴之間不停地上上下下，筷子挿進菜盌的聲音，與嘴巴不停地相碰的聲音，眞像一塲大雨傾盆倒桶而來，一霎間，便如風捲殘雲茶盌現出靑花底子來了。這時候，大家才把眼光收回，再來吃飯。這飯，似乎有些兒糟，一粒粒的沙子和着一粒粒的飯在牙齒間響來響去。從前鬧沙子的時候，隊長就曾經吼過：　　「你們軍人，這點都受不得！」　　現在當然大家都受得，不是大家已經都不做聲，圍在飯桶旁邊在擠着搶添第二盌飯了麽？　　可是飯剛剛裝下去，下面却更脹起來了。等到値星喊了一聲「解散」，大家都像蜂子朝王似的，拿着草紙就向毛房跑去。我跑到的時候，每一格却都蹲滿人了。許多遲到的都在旁邊跳着叫着。剛才搶我香烟的那同學正蹲在中間的一格呢。　　「媽的，起來！」　　我就去拉他的手。他急得臉都脹紅了，吼了起來。可是馬上就聽見毛房外隊剛從官長厠所出來經過的皮鞋聲音，而且吼道：　　「鬧甚麽，吃飽了麽！」　　馬上大家都不做聲。究竟那個翻杠架的同學拉得快，他剛剛站起來扎褲子，我已經搶着就擠上去了。　　本來在操塲上就着急起來的事情，現在才輕鬆的喊一聲「阿彌陀佛」。（完）</p>

<p>申報本埠增刊談言死的意義  法　　廢曆年關將屆，店家弄不落，關門大吉，個人弄不落，切煞吊死。今年的年夜，花頭正多呢？就今年一年而論，或因經濟壓迫而自殺的，或因戀愛失望而自殺的，總計起來，着實不少，就是當翁財閥，病入膏盲，諸醫束手，就幾千元一只人參，也辭不掉閻王的請帖，所以人必有一死，不死就不算爲人，但是同屬一死，而死的意義很多。　　雖說大丈夫視死如歸，但是走到這條上去路，到底有些寒澌澌所以打開我國歷史一看，自古忠臣，烈士，勇將，節婦，能有幾位出了死風頭，卽如明建文時，死得最慘的，便是一位兵部尙書鐵鉉先生，鉉被執至京，陛見，背立朝中，令一顧，不可得，割其耳鼻，竟不肯顧，薫其肉，納鉉口中，令啖之，問曰，甘否鉉厲聲曰，忠臣孝子之肉，有何不甘，遂寸磔之，上又令舁大鑊至，納油數斛，熬之，投鉉屍，頃刻成煤炭，導其屍朝上，轉展向外，終不可得，上大怒，令内侍用鐵棒十餘夾持之，使北面，笑曰，爾今亦朝我耶，語未畢，油沸忽濺起丈餘，諸内侍手盡糜爛，棄棒走，屍仍反背如故，鐵鉉先生這樣的死法，可說慘矣，這樣的烈法，古今也没有見過第二人，不但生前烈，連死後還烈，但是這種人，亦僅僅在歷史上留了一個忠臣的遺影，此外並不發生特别顯着的效果，至於宋儒發明了「失節事大，餓死事小」的明訓，也不過增加了大批孤兒寡婦，修訂了一條殺人不見血的慘酷的禮敎，此外也看出他的妙處，所以我看中國人的死法，祗有消極的，而没有積極的。　　二十五日路透社奥斯陸電，挪京奥斯陸大學敎授漢森，爲試騐能毒動物與魚之「重水」，是否兼能毒人起見，今日於數同事之前，傾「重水」十格姆於懷中，坦然飲之，諸同事皆爲惴惴，不過在發電時，尚未發生不良影響。我想假漢森敎授而竟遭不幸，亦是漢森敎授試騐的成功，他們能殉身學術，不顧性命的志願，實在令人欽佩。我國從前雖也曾有過一人，惟年代久遠，是否可靠，亦尙疑問。神農尙嘗百草，一日而遇七十毒，神而化之，遂作方書，以療民疾，而我國的醫道自此始。但是我國的歷史，尤其是古代的歷史，其不可靠者甚多，神農氏嘗七十毒之說，是否是徴，亦難言能。　　不過外人研究學術，視死事歸，不僅漢森敎授一人，其餘如同温層探險，南北極探險之類，不勝枚舉。卽如印度之甘地，亦爲抵抗帝國主義的壓迫，爲民族爭生存，而絶食至數星期之久，此種人愈死而愈有價値。愈死而愈有意義，我國靑年可以鑑矣。正經面孔  炳　　大槪是三歲上下的時候，那時我還剛剛學會說話，父親總是笑容可掬的逗着我說：「你將來要不要娶親？娶又娶一個怎樣模樣的」？先天的害羞心，統治了還僅僅三歲大的我的「表情」，休說回答話語，連一張小臉孔立刻漲得通紅，㧞步就要逃了。於是父親進一步施展他的技倆，一把拿牢我，更顯得隨便的說：「娶親是開心的事，你說，你快說！說了我給糖你吃」！孩子的羞心究竟是遊離的，聽說有糖吃，又卽刻定神安心了，掉頭一副「將信將疑」的面孔問：「糖咧，糖在那裏？」「糖在袋裏！你說了就拿給你吃」！父親再補上兩句。我於是就迅速的說：「娶的！要娶一個瓜子形臉的矮矮的女的。」父親這才滿足不窮追了。　　五歲起，我開始往一爿私塾裏上學，早出晚歸，夜裏還要温書，這就與父親漸漸疏離了；然而有空在家，也還總是和父親整日價糾纏，這時父親一開心的時候，也還要考問我，我來要不要娶親？娶又娶一個怎樣模樣的？這情形一直延續到我滿了十歲，别離了温暖的家庭，跑到相距四十里的市鎭上去進高小。</p>

<p>這時，因爲學样離家太遠，自已又幼小無知，所以一上學就是一個長時間的離别，待到寒暑假回去，父親就格外生疏起來了不，是正經起來了，一望過去面孔是嚴肅的，說起話來，不是問學校裏的情形怎樣，便是訓勉我要發奮讀書，前昔左一句右一句追問我要不要娶親，娶又娶一個怎樣模樣的一套都擱置不提了。等到再長大些以後，他不但不提，而且一聽見我提及女人一類的字眼，他就有些表示不耐聽，會心的站開了　　這情形，一向在我腦筋裏留着很深的印象，然而我不曾怎樣去推敲過，以爲父子之間，甚至是說長少之間，人類之間，是應該這麽隱隱諱諱，只許會心的。人長大了自不能與小孩時相比。　　然而最近我却爲着這小問題苦思了幾個晚上，覺得這完全是「正經面孔」在作祟。　　人原來是如此的，不獨是父子之間如此，就在社交上也是這麽樣，凡是老少碰在一塊兒，所談的無非是够乾脆的幾句正經話，而一副面孔的表情，更是嚴肅得害怕。　　苟非然者，就是輕佻，就是「孺子不可敎」，僅僅由這一點可以判定他的爲人，有不有用處。至於骨子裏是怎樣的隨便，這郤是一槪不管。人是應該這樣的，做壞事要關起門來做，女人壓根兒是「床上的朋友」。然而我擺弄不來一副「正經面孔」。　　我以爲，這又何必呢，一個人在社會上應該是赤顆顆的，那麽做得，就這麽說得，騙人家不打緊，騙自已眞不値得。我們應認清楚，人與禽獸之異，並非眞在這些地方，人果有異者是在有一個靈活的腦和一雙手。　　荀子曰：「人之性惡，其善者，僞也。」我倒以爲：「人之性邪，其面孔正經者，僞也。」黑夜的岸頭  丁星　　暗夜：北風挾着細雨飄，飄得密時，雨點落在岸邊的船蓬上，嘩喇地響一陣，但接着便漸漸稀疏到停止了。像這樣一疏一密地，約略相隔一刻鐘那樣，不住地循環着。這天氣，一看就知道是不便於行船的；可是，岸頭上，一羣傻子似的挑夫還死心地在等進口的船｜｜你說他傻嗎？那是你自已傻！明天早晨的飯是靠着這進口的船呢，好歹都得等等呵！　　這是一個下弦的晚上，潮水平漲要到下夜三點鐘；現在不過是三更過後不久，至少得再等點把　。各人縮着頭，縮着身，兩手挿在腰間的圍巾裏，把挑行李的　擔和索子都夾在腋下；咬緊牙關，忍過身體一陣陣的抖戰，讓細雨在頭頂灑着，絲絲地。　　只要相離幾步遠，對面是看不見的；可是就在這漆黑中，站得較近的幾個，漸漸談起來了。　　「這晚上到底有船進來没有，你想？喂！氏是阿金嗎？」　　「你知道，我知道？」聲音答應了他是被喚的人。　　「我看十成九是没有的！」　　「總不會没有一條進來吧，我看，」另一個挿進一句，「現在什麽時候有了？」　　「三更不是剛響過不久！」　　「不止了吧，打更的有時靠不住。你聽，港裏有水聲了呢！」　　談話立刻就停了下來。靜靜地聽聽水聲，潮水確實在港底湧着響了。若是平常，這光景不消再等半個鐘頭，先頭的船是可以進港了的。　　「没有船進來，潮水他媽媽的用！」是最先開口那個的聲音；别人并不響，因爲大家心裏都是那麽一樣的想。　　就在這時候，一陣加倍大的風從各人耳邊擦過，港口外隱隱地拖着呼：呼的悠長尾音；這尾音很像一塊石頭，重重地壓上了每個心頭，那麽重，愛多嘴的那個認不住又駡了一句；　　「索性再大點來吧，也好讓人家回家睡覺去！」　　「不要多嘴咧！靜靜再等一刻好啦！」另外一個厭煩這悲觀的反響；於是大家又沈寂起來了，包圍着黑漆和寒冷的沈寂呵！　　夜在一刻一刻地縮短着。除了港底潮水的湧聲外，遠近只有風號的傳應。時間在死寂中溜過許多之後，黑暗裏不知那一個忽然呌了起來：　　「來囉！港口那邊有盞燈火不是？」　　「呵！是的，有呵！有呵！」應聲依各人發見燈火的先後連續喊出了；雖然有人還帶着不安地在說：「只怕不是客船（載客的船）吧？」：　　希望究　　、起了：一羣人的眼睛都死釘在港口外那盞燈火望着，接着又一盞出現了，於是有希望的成分加多了，岸頭上漸漸騷動起來。　　兩盞燈慢慢地循曲折的港道蜿蜒進來，像光度過强的恒星似地閃燦不定：有時離開了岸上人的視綫，但一會又出現了。就這樣一直再過一刻鐘光景，到約略聲音可以到達的地方，在岸上的人忍不住就喊了：　　「是什麽船呀？」　　没有　　　　　還聽不到　　不久刮刮的漿聲就傳來了，於是好幾個人又同時喊了起來：　　「來的是客船嗎？」　　喊聲從水面顫着跳過去，很響亮；一陣風夾雨剛好撲向岸這邊，送來一個似是婦人音調的回答：　　「是漁船呵！」　　和冷水澆進心裏一般，各人都咬緊牙關忍過一陣失望的冷戰；其中一個不甘心地再問：　　「後面還有船跟來没有？」　　「没有囉！」這回是男人的聲音，「這暗夜有什麽客船！我們漁船是不得已拚進來的，外面的風够大呵！」　　現在什麽都可明白了，相信了，没有人願意再延長着空的期待。在黑暗中，踏着細雨漬成的濘滑石路，一羣人慢慢地分散了；大家都很少開口，只幾個喃喃地低駡着。雖然各人正向着各人不同的家走去；然而，在每個人心裏頭，却同樣地閃着一個顯明的念頭：「餓！」歸  詠輝　　炎熱的六月，天，是澄清的，澄清得没有一絲淡雲；湖水呢，也是澄清的，不起一些漪漣的微紋呢。　　故鄉，已是好幾年没有回去了；僅僅在夢境中，沉思中，尙能憶起一個模糊的輪廓，花呀，草呀，美麗的鳥兒</p>
<p>Page 23</p>
<p>兒呀，童年時候的伴侶呀······片斷的，瑣碎的，在腦子裏整理起來，連續起來，組成了一幅美麗的畫兒。　　現在呢，小划船兒祇需由前面的一個靑蒼山脚邊轉過去，就能看到他的故鄉｜｜在夢境與沉思中思念的故鄉了。快樂的心是一陣緊似一陣的悸着，身子都爲喜悅而顫抖了。　　「船老板，我的家還要轉過前面的另一個小山才到麽？眞是幾年不回來，什麽都忘了」。他反轉頭來望着搖船的老頭兒，在轉過了山灣之後。「這裏正是黃泥段啊」！老頭兒隨口答應着。　　「怎麽？這裏是黃泥段？房子和人呢」？他驚異得氣都透不出來，對展開在他眼前的小平原呆住了。　　「房子燒掉了，人也殺了一半，其餘的都逃到口岸上去了！這幾年不知是什麽兇神惡煞下界哩！好好的地方都遭了瘟」。　　「············」　　「············」　　踏上了岸，靜悄悄地聽不到一個人說話：中午的太陽是火一般的炙熱，炙得人疲倦得要睡去似的；知了在樹上鳴着哀曲，還間着一兩聲烏鴉的嘶啼，和遠處的一隻長頸鷺驚撥得水花「嘩」的一濺，都能很清楚的攝入他的　中；那傷感的味兒，眞像一個孤獨的旅行者迷失在荒島上一樣的難堪！他萬想不到他的故鄉竟以如此荒蕪的姿態出現在他的眼前了。他舉目四顧，流着淚默念着：「母親呢···家呢···曾經長出靑靑的稻草的田呢···鄰家呢···」他簡直不相信這是事實，好像是在做夢：他朝夕想念的故鄉是這樣的麽？是連一片瓦燦都找不到的麽？誰會相信呢！　　走着，走着，數幢茅屋在黃泥段的盡頭出現在他的眼前！一個農夫裝束的老頭兒，迎着他走來，他像發現了寳貝似的：「借問你老人家，這裏有一家姓鍾的麽？前幾年的鍾裕厚堂」！　　「哦！鍾家麽？前年就不在這裏住了，你找他家做什麽」！老頭兒對這個突然來訪的異客表現驚奇，同時又感到興味。　　「我就是鍾家的第二個兒子，進之是我的爸爸啊」！　　「你是建儒麽？我老糊塗了，人也不認得了」！　　「你老人家是·······」　　「是方老子呀！種過你家的田的」。　　「哦！是方老！我家搬在什麽地方，你曉得麽」？　　和乾娘在離這裏六十里遠的長板鎭住，你的爺在前年兵荒馬亂的時候······殺·······」方老子知道自已說錯了，但是來不及收住了。　　用藏滿了淚水的眼睛呆視着方老子，耳朶裏嗡嗡作響，一個歪脚，身子向地下暈倒了。松江書畫展覧會作品之五  樓予情先生近作業餘信箱夫婦間的貞操觀編者先生：　　茲有敝友聞君於去年，由媒人介紹，與一女子訂婚，訂婚時共用去禮金等費，約二三百元。惟最近聞君聽得各方之傳說，謂乙女前曾與人發生苟且之事，彼遂親向女家各親戚處探聽，結果多數均云：確有其事。乃請媒人暗中向女詢問，女堅决否認從前之行爲。惟聞君總是懷疑不决，不知是否事實。同時彼又甚注重貞操觀念，認爲彼女如屬處女，則定期迎娶，否則决不願結成夫婦。於是遂發生下列幾項問題，託吾函懇先生加以答覆。　　（一）如何可知此女是否完璧？有無簡單方法？可否請醫檢騐？（此事女父似表同意。）　　（二）如經騐過，確非處女，則此項婚約可否解除？　　（三）解除婚約，可否向女家索回禮金等物？　　專上，敬請撰安　　陳興國上　　編者按：過去之事，本不必深究。况此女　日不貞，尙　確定是否　實，聞君　能輕信流言，而　疑他人乎？　　婚姻全以性情適合，能够互相敬愛爲主。聞君如對此女現在行爲及其性情認爲滿意，有結合可能，應卽定期舉行婚禮，不必多所狐疑。否則可向女家要求解約，免得結婚後，再起糾紛。　　關於男女貞操一事，際此郠代潮流，本爲結婚後雙方應守之義務。惟婚前是否貞操，似不必過於注重。且現在女子喜動，處女膜由於劇烈之運動，時有破裂之虞，是故處女膜之破裂，每難確定其是否處女耳。　　因此我們以爲檢騐處女一舉，似可不必。蓋卽經騐過，確屬處女，若結婚後彼此性情不合，則固與是否處女問題無關也。自我職業介紹　　劍女士，年念五，高中師範科卒業，本市敎育局第八屆登記及格，長於國文算術等科，願担任家庭敎師或爲小學生補習（地點能在北四川路施高塔路附近尤佳，）有意者請函赫德路慈航醫院麗儂女士轉。　　消息　上海舞臺恊會，爲海上電影界及戲劇界知名之士所組織，今日起作第一次公演於金城大戲院，公演劇目爲「水銀燈下」｜即臨時演員，及最近排練之「回春之曲」，該會人才濟濟，當能爲戲劇界放一異彩也。無綫電播音莭目特别節目　　大光明歌詠社　　航運（一一八○）下午三時至五時　　勇士凱歌　鳳陽歌　薔薇之歌　女軍人歌大路歌　夜月之歌　畢業歌　漁村之歌飛花歌　（歡迎電話點唱）歌唱　　上海無綫電劇社　　永生（一○八○）下午四時半至五時半　　愛情是甚麽（姚莉）花想容（曼娜）花生米（露茜）牧羊女（姚莉）鴛鴦怨（曼娜）小妹妹的心（露茜）麻雀和小孩（曼娜姚莉露茜）　　大中華（一一六○）下午八時至九時　　因爲你太美（嚴斐）薔薇花底（姚莉）羅宮綺夢（曼娜）新婚燕爾（露茜）永别了弟弟（嚴斐）休息五分鐘（姚莉）摩登戀愛（曼娜）給摩登小姐（露茜）</p>

屬，改爲有組織之軍隊，正式向暴虐政府宣戰。惟因維拉不諳軍人紀律，麥另派柏斯嘉爾將軍爲總司令，維拉須受其節制。維初不願，旣而聽命焉。　　約翰深知維拉戇直，易於利用，故意電告各報，詭稱維拉一軍，已攻克防務嚴密之聖羅薩利城，即以報紙向維拉宣讀，謂新聞與事實不符，有礙本人信譽，言下欷歔，維拉不知是計，竟背總司令調度，立率三軍，星夜進攻聖羅薩利城，一舉而陷之，於是維拉之威名益振。總司令柏斯嘉爾雖嫉視之，顧亦無如之何。　　民軍所向無敵，國王達亞氏宣告退位，維拉乃推麥台羅爲大總統。麥就任後，下今解散軍隊，任柏所斯嘉爾爲高等顧問，囑維拉解甲歸田，以事休息。臨别時，麥以一戒指爲贈，以資紀念，並表二人無上之友義。　　維拉測知柏非善類，恐麥有失，故仍伺機而動。不幸以向銀行取欵，而被誣爲越貨殺人，身入囹圄，横受柏斯嘉爾之催殘，幸得麥台羅之解救，免遭鎗决。　　維拉被判流戍，於埃爾派索地方遇見約翰，得悉麥氏已爲柏斯嘉爾所殺。維拉怒不可遏，登高一呼，揭竿而起，民衆來歸者十萬人，二次革命乃作。不數日，進佔京城，處柏斯嘉爾以極刑，自任爲臨時大總統。　　初，大地主唐斐烈普因麥台羅已死，無人能駕馭維拉，難免有劫殺焚掠之事，故於二次革命不允參加。維拉怒，酒後誤殺唐妹，唐亦身受重創。懷恨心節，亟圖報復　　維拉本係莽夫，不慣爲總統，未幾辭職，重返田間，與嬌妻愛子共享天倫之樂。雖然，維拉仍以在野之身，作清除反動份子之工作。一日，維拉入城，途遇約翰，相與言歡。忽鎗彈連珠飛來，維拉應聲倒地，蓋唐斐烈普等正伺於對樓隱處，實現其復仇之計劃也。維拉瞋目之前，囑約翰以生花之筆，紀其被刺事蹟，約翰首肯之；維拉乃含笑而逝。</p>

<p>紅羊豪俠傳特刋爲太平軍表襮革命意識  范煙橋　　太平軍在民間的印象太壞了，一方面由於清政府惡意的反宣傳，稱他爲髮逆，民間就因了這髮逆兩字，稱他爲長毛，一方面太平軍自身也生了裂良，尤甚是軍隊不能紀律化，民間直接感受到許多痛苦，就把革命的意識毁滅了，好像是一隻橘子，本來是狠肥甘鮮美的，一部份的人不識貨，說是橙柑之類，而橘子自已先在潰爛，起腐化作用，於是便給人抛棄了，　　我看到的關於太平軍的書，在民國成立以後出版的，大槪都能够明瞭的意識了，但是又覺得過於粉飾，反而使人懷疑，以爲是矯枉過正，要找一部公正的記述，像司馬遷對於重瞳那麽寫得有褒有貶的，實在不可得，至於外國人寫的，像「太平天國外紀」，比較的可徴信些但是只寫東南一角，没有整個的觀察和體騐，所以我想多看幾年書，寫一本太平天國的史料出來，倒是狠有趣味的一回事，　　太平軍故事演出在紅氍毺上的，以前只有「鐵公鷄」最膾炙人口，可是完全表現在清軍的忠勇，與太平軍以不利的，最近上海共舞臺有「紅羊豪俠傳」的編排，一反以前的態度，現在新華公司攝成電影，大約更能替太平軍表襮革命的意識了，　　從公私記載上得到太平軍當時的政績，開科舉分男女兩榜，是提倡男女的先聲，禁止纏足，買倡，置妾，販奴，是人道主義的見端，還有公田制度，禁止土地田畝私有，不許私藏金銀，革命思想，都現着尖銳化，可惜和當時的環境不相稱，和王安石的新政一般，爲世所詬病，到了現在便成了極有價値的政策了，　　還有一點，也見得太平軍領袖的思想新穎，而有科學頭腦，他們嫌着陰曆的計算不便利，創造一種新曆法，每年十二月，單月三十天，雙月三十一天，旣不違背地球繞日的周天數，又是容易記憶，近來西洋的天文家，正在想改革曆法詎知七十多年前，中國已經有了實行家了，　　關於太平軍的軼事，一時也寫不盡，單講洪秀全的兒子，大家都以爲名福瑱豈知他初名天貴，後來秀全好異，作三字名，呼爲天貴福，同治三年五月，秀全死，福受部下擁立，造壐文曰，「洪福」於名下横列「眞王」二字，意思是眞命天子，以取信於民衆，人家見了，誤眞王二字爲一字，便連成「洪福瑱」了，　　曾國藩的日記裏說，忠王李秀成的供狀，有四萬餘字，當時曾氏一一親自校過，分八九人謄寫，共寫一百三十葉，每葉二百六十字，已經删剩二萬八千餘字，後來奉清旨頒布，只剩二萬七千餘字了，中間一定有許多有關太平軍軍事政治的各種史料，可惜都給删除了，　　我友沈雷漁君，新從南洋來，告訴靂霹州有一個地方，名「太平」那邊旅館裏的傳者說，八十年前，霹靂州全境尙未開闢，太平地方，更是虎豹所踞，人跡不到，太平軍失敗，兩廣附義之士，在祖國立脚不住，紛紛向南洋遁隱，輾轉到此，披荆斬棘，慘淡經營，不久就成了一個新興的市集，他們就稱其地爲「太平」，現在「太平」成了霹靂州的首府，高山廻環，商港密接，礦區綿亘，農圃相望，南洋人都喜歡到那裏去遊歷，尤其是新婚的蜜月旅行，都把這地方爲目的地，所以路上一對對的情侶，卿卿我我，大有太平景象，倘然望文生訓起來，或者要誤解他的命意，忘篳路襤縷，以啓山林的太平遺民咧，　　太平的失敗，果然以自相殘殺，斵喪元氣爲最大原因，但是當時各地土著的附和，絶少智識階級的中堅人物，主持擘畫，任着他們横行鄉里，失却民衆的信仰，致引起上海外僑的反感，有洋鎗隊的助清，也是一個致命傷，湘淮軍恢復東南一帶的名城，不是直接仰仗於洋槍隊，間接也得到久國軍火的接濟，此風一開，後來中國的内戰，差不多没有一次不和帝國主義者發生關係了，　　蘇州的攷古，是有一種異於官書所記的傳說的，當時完全出於誘降的狡計，我仍經下過一番考証工夫，發見許多可以証明傳說不誤的記載，爲了文字太長，不便迻錄，倘然攝製電影，對於這一點，加以糾正，倒也是狠精采的片斷，　　歷史的電影劇，最難攝製了，除掉事實的剪裁，須費一番心思，而道具背景，也是一點不容脫略疏忽的，以前產生過幾種歷史的電影劇，似乎都犯了幼稚病，我想國產電影這幾年來，已有相當的進步，這「紅羊豪俠傳」的成就，一定是狠偉大的，拭目以俟罷，銀幕上的意識  （嚴獨鶴）　　電影在藝術上佔重要之位置，此爲舉世所公認，蓋天壞間一切可歌可泣可喜可愕之事，文字語言所不能狀述者，電影得於一刹那間盡揭之銀幕而無遺使觀衆對之凝神壹志，自起内心之共鳴，故能於潛移默化之間，轉變社會，箴砭世俗，其功效自爲任何道德法律所不及。今者新華影業公司採取紅羊豪俠之故事搬演於銀幕，寫洪楊韋石諸先民民族革命之行動，似火似荼，有聲有色，所以發揚民氣，挽回人心者，不遺餘力，的是有價値之作品，　　滿清時代，以專制淫威，顚倒黑白，竭其種種反宣傳之工作，於是父老談及洪楊往事，與一般民衆以惡劣之印象甚深，汪仲賢君旣爲共舞台編成「紅羊豪俠傳」舞台劇，藉優孟之衣冠，表先民之俠蹟，開演以來，哄動社會，茲新華公司復有此影片之攝製，服裝背景，較諸舞台劇尤爲逼眞，宣傳力之宏大，自不言可喻，專刋發行，善琨先生索稿於予，爰樂誌數言，藉補餘白，紅羊豪俠的使命  蔣吟秋　　大凡談到革命史的，不外乎兩種，一種是政治革命，一種是種族革命，商湯周武，便是政治革命的起源，朱明紅羊，才是種族革命的先河，雖是一成一敗，結果不同，可是他的主義，却是一般無二，　　因爲洪楊諸先民，當那道光咸豐之間，眼見得滿清政治的昏暗，一天不如一天，而雅片戰事，列强對華的侵迫，一天利害一天，痛恨到了極點，於是約集了天下豪俊，協謀改革，起兵舉義，想那奮跡西粤，奠都南京，略武漢而下江西，陷浙江而窺齊魯，振臂一呼，四方響應，曆年十餘載，擁地十多省，那種豪俠的氣慨，義烈而風尙，幾取滿清而代之，豈非民族革命的激發，民族思想的活躍，有以促成的嗎，　　雖說志業没有完成，可是轟轟烈烈，把民族主義，導革命的先聲；上足以繼洪武的屋元，下足以啓民國的覆清，那堅苦卓絶的壯志，實在未可任其湮滅咧，徒是因了當時侑於成王敗冠的偏見，對於洪楊的史料，往往妄肆詆諆，任意處誣，使他凶跡獨彰，殊不知以後的廢除科舉，崇尙新學，勸戒纒足，禁吸雅片，以及改用陽歷，提倡女學等等，那一椿不是根據洪楊的先導，那一件没有經過洪楊的設計，至於民間，知道的恐怕恨少，　　所以近年以來，關於太平天國的記述，漸漸兒有得發表了，或中傳記，或是政制，或是英雄豪俠的遺聞軼事，一方面表揚先烈，一方面激勵民氣，不過憑藉文字，還不能深入民間，倘然編攝電影，不更比較有力嗎，洪秀全與馮雲山向民衆宣傳民族主義周鳯文與童美娟　　最近上海新華影業公司有鑒於斯，深知洪楊一役，確是我國民族革命的光榮史績，蒐集了不少的材料，攝製了有聲的影片，名曰，「紅羊豪俠傳」，實在也因了近年以來，内憂外患，交相爲困，若不喚起民衆，復興民族，何以挽危局而圖自强，所以「紅羊豪俠傳」的使命，便是把「電影敎育的力量，來做激發民氣的工作」那末，他的價値，比了尋常悲歡離合，哀感頑艶的一般影片，自然不可同日而語了，太平天國政治有足稱道  張恨水　　鄭子逸梅爲新華影業公司編輯紅羊豪俠傳專刋，來函索稿，囑爲洪楊張目，因思成王敗寇，爲吾國史家慣例，太平軍以民族革命，起義金田，與清軍對抗達二十載，苟非軍政均有所長，曷克臻此，洪楊旣敗，滿人呼之曰髮逆，曰長毛賊，漢人忘其所以，亦從而呼之，洵可笑亦可哀也，清社旣屋，太平天國事，乃稍稍爲人稱道，然亦多偏重軼聞遺事，鮮能發揮其民族精神，吾嘗讀太平天國史料，見其詔書採用白話，君臣相呼，冠以兄弟，官爵不分性别，已有女將，而最爲難得者，則採用均田制度，計口授田，均爲今日新興國家具有之良政，而數十年前已見於我國，此非値得稱道之處乎，今新華影業公司攝製洪楊豪俠傳，將以發揮民族精神，其意甚是，竊盼勿徒眩奇幻，而於天國革命意義，多所搜集也，題紅羊豪俠傳影片  趙煥亭　　異軍特起無全虜。獵獵南旌逐北風。還我河山收漢士。劍光如雪氣如虹。　　金田軍動氣何遵。半壁東南指顧收。坐鎭秣陵雖失策。風雲氣自壯神州。　　題紅羊傳影片　　紅羊豪俠氣如虹。首義金田樹戰功。　　此是光榮民族史。莫將成敗論英雄。　　銀幕搜求史料新。繪聲繪影見精神。　　定知公映春申日。空巷來觀幾萬人。徐琴芳用武有地  梅　　徐琴芳自在荒江女俠飾玉琴一角，極剛健婀娜之致，一時拜倒銀壇下者，不知幾千萬人，顧自一二八之役，友聯公司被燬於火，琴芳乃入昨星公司充任要角，然以武俠影片爲當軸所禁，不得再行攝製，徐琴芳頗有用武無地之慨，提倡民族精神，表揚革命史蹟，宗旨異常純正，黨國要人紛紛題獎，固不同於尋常武俠片也，其中有洪秀全妹宣嬌一角，能文擅武，以徐琴芳之個性最爲相近，新華公司張善琨遂延之現身銀幕，舞劍拔刃，盤馬彎弓，精神極其飽滿，見之者曰，徐琴芳用武有地矣，琴芳一笑嫣然，蓋甚爲得意云，王虎辰與徐琴芳記曾軍攻寗事  漱六山房　　鄭子逸梅，淹雅淵博，有聲於時，治小說家言，尤能獨出心裁，别開蹊徑，是吾夙所欽服者也，今爲新華影業公司主編紅羊豪俠傳專號，飛札徴文，惜病後腦劣，苦無以應，特紀曾軍軼事一則應之，藉以掩其蕪陋，其他記憶中之紅羊軼事尙多，限於篇幅，不及紀矣，洪氏定都金陵而後，迭遭挫折，兵勢大衰，一敗於楊秀清之遇害，二敗於石達開出奔，其時忠王李秀成寔爲太平軍中之名將，而尙未入握政權，清軍數次合圍，均以援軍驟至而敗衂，向榮之敗，江南大營一潰，張國樑之敗，江南大營再潰，何桂清以江督駐紥常州，東南倚爲柱石，而匆匆遁去，庫銀尙存七十萬，糧秣軍械如山，人民倚如長城，故何駐節常州之時，市面甚盛，靑樓歌吹，徹夜沸騰，端午龍舟之盛，雖承平時代所不及，何督以爲張國樑圍寗已久，指日可以盪平，城守之具，一無所備，迨大營再潰，兵士以欠餉已久，困頓嗟怨，隱有叛意，張國樑時已總統諸軍，飛書調餉六十萬，冀以收拾人心，背城借一，而何止給六萬，全軍解體，鎭江再敗，遂退丹陽，張國樑知事不可爲，整隊出戰，力竭陣亡，何氏始倉皇逃去，常州失守，蘇錫隨之，東南大局，一旦糜爛，何氏之罪，誠擢髮而不可數矣，　　湘軍自出洞庭湖，轉戰而前，所向皆捷，曾國藩奉命督師，遂以曾國藩統湘軍全力攻寗，而另定蘇浙分攻之策，以李鴻章統淮軍攻蘇，左宗棠統湘軍攻浙，李秀成已爲洪氏留於圍城之中，不能調軍入援，曾軍頓兵堅城之下，日久無功，屢開地道，欲以地雷攻城，二次皆爲太平軍所發覺，湘軍死者甚多，時常州趙惠甫先生，爲曾國藩之門人，曾極重其才，特令與曾國藩同往，贊畫軍務，會政府以湘軍攻寗不下，將調李鴻章率淮軍協攻，國藩大憤，冒暑進攻，晝夜不輟，而仍自舊時地道中掘地猛進，一面急攻各城，使不及備，太平軍雖防禦甚嚴而不意其仍循舊隧，地雷旣發，城陷數十丈，湘軍肉薄而登，曾及諸將已十餘晝夜不寐，於極疲之際，上馬入城，曾在馬上時時欲寐，額汗如雨，神疲欲脫，通過一巨宅之門，曾力不能支，下馬逕入，廳左有書室，床帳全備，曾入室，登床立睡，鼾聲已起，趙惠甫先生適在左右·大驚曰，此何時也，主師詎可安睡，力撼之醒曰，今城軍米盡·各道皆在巷戰，急須彈壓鎭懾，何可遽睡，曾闔目唶曰，吾疲極不睡且立死，諸事君爲料理可也，語甫竟，立睡如朽橛，鼾聲又起，其時太平軍以銳卒冲出城缺而去，湘軍則四路搜殺，洪軍紛紛巷戰，湘軍且戰，且縱火焚掠，火光四起，喊聲大作，曾睡至次日，仍不醒，惠甫先生不得已，力扶之起，大呼曰，今巷戰至烈，大局未定，吾軍且縱火刧掠，安可再睡，曾怒曰，吾已托君料理，速傳令禁止殺掠放火，違者斬之，語旣又睡，惠先生無奈，乃令提督伍某，傳令嚴禁，伍立馳出外，方大聲宜令，諸將中有驍悍者，怒曰，吾輩十餘晝夜不睡，死生瞬息，所爲何事，特爲此一日耳，力奪令箭折而爲兩，脆然有聲，兵士亦隨聲附和，其勢洶洶，急且生變，伍乃以傳令馬驚，令箭墮地，經馬蹄踏折爲詞，含糊覆令，諸軍亦稍有戒心，相繼歸隊，曾直臥至是日夜間方起，酣睡三十餘小時，太平軍歷年所積之金珠重寳，已悉爲湘軍將士所得，顧湘軍素服曾氏，猶别留數十萬以奉曾，故南京破城之後，曾奏報當日情形，所報者除器械甲杖而外，金銀珠寳，竟絲毫無有，雖得數十萬，而不及諸將所得十分之一，故曾雖立此大功，賞賚甚薄，且幾至因而獲罪，亦由於此，蓋南京爲太平軍定都之地，歷年所得之各省精華，均移於此，焉有絶無金寳之理，當時言官彈劾者甚多，並請查抄家產，清廷恐寒諸將之心，僅令曾國藩查復而已，此爲惠甫先行親述之言，當時人多不知其事，亦爲太平軍中之軼聞也。　　曾部驍將李臣典

<p>明星公司全部　歌唱聲片「空谷蘭」特刊重攝後的「空谷蘭」它的故事，人物，背景  微子　　在明星公司過去許多名片當中，「空谷蘭」是最膾炙人口的一部。那是由張織雲，楊耐梅，朱飛主演，張石川先生導演的，鄭小秋那時還是個天眞未鑿的小孩子，在片中飾良彥一角。因爲故事情節的詭奇，結構的緊凑，以及描寫倫理愛的情感豐富，當時公映以後，被觀衆狂熱地愛好的情形，較之「姊妹花」和「再生花」，也並不多讓。去年春間，「空欲蘭」在上海各戲院公映的時候，雖然是一張八九年前的舊片，也仍然没有失去它的强大的號召力。　　因爲看到一般觀衆對於「空谷蘭」的愛好的熱烈，而且「空谷蘭」的故事所昭示於觀衆的意義，祗要稍稍加以改削，也還有它本身的價値，因此，把「空谷蘭」改編重攝有聲片的計劃在明星公司的編劇會議中通過以後，就立刻實行了。　　默片的「空谷蘭」，原是分爲上下兩集的，爲了膠片的經濟起見，决定將它改爲一部，許多不必要的情節或穿挿，完全删削去了，「擷精取華」，使故事更緊凑起來。一方面，在題旨上也稍稍改變了一下：原來的故事，只是描寫母子間的天性的至愛，和後母虐待兒女的慘酷狠毒，似乎是單純的倫理片。現在的「空谷蘭」，一方面仍然着眼於母性愛的眞摯偉大，並且更强調地描寫了一般封建家庭的女性的偏狹自私；一方面，又嚴酷地指摘了紳士社會虛假無謂的繁文褥節，寫出了不同階級的戀愛的破滅。　　經過這樣改削了以後的「空谷蘭」，可以說是相當完整了的。關於它的故事，大槪已有不少讀者知道了。導演仍由張石川君担任。這裏把「空谷蘭」劇中的主要人物和飾演的演員，逐一介紹如下：　　陶紉珠｜｜這是「空谷蘭」中第一個女主人公，她是一個小資產階級的女兒，個性非常堅强；她因爲偶然的因緣，和一位叫做紀蘭蓀的貴族少年戀愛了，嫁到紀家去以後，却因爲她對於一切貴族家庭的生活習慣不同，自已又不願遷就還境，去做那些虛假無謂的應酬，覺得非常痛苦，而且夫妻間又生了裂痕，她終於離開了她襁褓中的愛子，逃了出來。後來因爲究竟忘不了她的兒子，又跑回那地方去，化了名在當地的小學校裏敎書。她的一生，可以說極盡了悲歡離合之致。飾演紉珠的演員，是胡蝶女士，以她的美麗，聰明，老練，自然不難演得恰到好處。劇中還有一個和紉珠相貌神似的丫頭翠兒，也由胡女士兼飾。　　紀蘭蓀｜｜這一個有着善良的靈塊的貴族少年，戰地歸來，帶了戰死的故友的囑託，去看那友人的老父弱妹，結果就和那妹妹紉珠戀愛了。英俊爽颯的高占非担任了這個角色，實在是非常切合的。他那種豪華的氣派不必說，演到後來不能够克服環境，而又不能忘懷愛妻的矛盾情形，也演得非常深刻。　　靑柳夫人｜｜貴族太太與紀蘭蓀的母親，由宣景琳扮演。宣女士的飾老婦人，是一時無兩的，她在這裏飾半老貴婦人的驕奢情態，成績是不難想像。　　金柔雲｜｜從小寄養在紀家的，蘭蓀的表妹。這是一個完全偏狹自私，妒嫉陰險，蛇一般的女性的典型。她的外表，是風騷妖豔，她的内心，是卑劣狠毒，她離間紉珠夫妻的愛情，虐待紉珠的兒子良彥（她後來是和蘭蓀結婚了的），差不我成了那家庭間的美麗的魔鬼。｜｜這樣的人物，自然非二姐嚴月閒扮演不可　　陶時介。紉珠的哥哥，蘭蓀的軍伍中的好友，後來是戰死在沙塲上的。這角色並不十分的重要，由趙丹担任，當然游刃有餘。　　良彥｜｜紉珠的兒子，在柔雲的虐待之下，過着最悲慘的日子。這童角是極重要的，演員由明星公司新發見的童星沈駿担任，表演極有天才（「女兒經」中曾露過一面。）　　此外，如王獻齋，孫敏，王徴信，王吉亭，徐莘園，顧梅君，蘭君，王慧娟，黃耐霜，胡笳，舒繡文······等等，也全在片中担任配角，可見導演對於本片的重視了。美滿的合作  晴雲　　過去，胡蝶是明星的紅女星，而高占非是聯華的紅男星，明星胡蝶主演的「自由之花」，與聯華高占非主演的「都會的早晨」在過去的影壇上都大大的哄動過：那時，有許多影迷都　憬着說：「假使高占非與胡蝶作合一部新影片，那就好啦！」　　而現在，以英俊瀟洒著名的高占非，加入了明星，在靜養已久的張石川導演的手腕下，與胡蝶合作最精彩之有聲歌唱的社會劇「空谷蘭」，這消息是値得影迷們驚喜的。　　「空谷蘭」在過去的默片時代，牠曾以極新的姿態出現。劇情的「哀感艶麗，曲折感人」是早爲觀衆所稱道了：而他的故事的人含有嚴重的社會性，更爲人所注目。牠對於舊家庭中之矛盾性，舊家庭的人物中的封建思想，也有正確的暴露；描寫人與人的愛情，母子之愛，牠是中國影壇上最深刻的一部作品了；而在過去所認爲缺點的呢？就是無聲。　　自有聲電影發明以來，世界的影壇都瘋狂地轉變了新的方向，從事攝製有聲電影，雖然如滑稽大家「卓别靈」加以極端的反對，然而也不過是他一人而已，有聲電影，却一天天在發展風行。無疑，電影的製作者，如果能够正確的利用有聲電影的長處，「有聲」對於影片的一切情調感動力等等，都有極大的帮助的。　　以「空谷蘭」哀感艶麗曲折感人之劇情，配以歌唱改攝全部有聲對白電影，無論在那一方面，牠都將收到更大的効果，更大的成功！尤其是在演員方面，由目前中國影壇以表情最著名的；幽靜文雅的胡蝶，英俊健壯的高占非，風騷妖冶的嚴月閒，演技最佳的宣景琳，他們在一起搭擋，美滿的成績的收獲是當然的了！　　有聲「空谷蘭」中，有三支歌曲：胡蝶唱的柔美輕悠，「微風吹搖樹枝頭」，高占非唱的激昂雄壯，「波濤衝擊了岩石」。情調異樣優良。而另外値得報告的，就是胡蝶在「在空谷蘭」裏一人演飾三種姿態的三個角色，「姊妹花」胡蝶演飾「大保二保」，把貧富姿態演得極成功，已使感到若没有豐富的經騐表演的天才的人，是萬難演飾的，而胡蝶在「空谷蘭」上却更進一步的演飾起三種人物的三種姿態來，我們敬祝胡蝶表演藝術之成功！　　最後的報告；「空谷蘭」在許多之加緊攝製努力工作下，現在，已完全攝竣，預備舊歷除夕獻映於新光大戲院。「空谷蘭」觀後感  木人　　中國的婦女在幾千年來的封建重壓之下，得不着解放。因爲中國急待解决婦女問題，於是中國電影以婦女爲主題的影片就多起來了，例如「女人」，「三姊妹」，「路柳牆花」，「婦道」，和重攝聲片的「空谷蘭」等，這都是以婦女爲中心的。　　「空谷蘭」描寫一對自由戀愛的男女，當他倆結過婚後，女的在封建的舊禮敎的壓迫下，不能容忍於家庭，便毅然地走出了，但男的又不敢反對這種不良的腐敗的家庭，只有忍受着這種痛苦。當然，在這種主題的展開了，要造成了許多「哀感頑艶」的故事了。　　我們知道，變愛之所以會由熱烈而降至冷淡的原因，自然很複雜，經濟，思想，情感，習慣等，這些都能影響到男女婚姻的幸福，就是極小的細故也會對婚姻發生影響，例如，第三者闖入，單方面的熱情幻滅，家庭間的生活境遇不順適等。在戀愛時代固然能混矇過去，一到了結合同居之後，就會成功很嚴重的問題，以致雙方都弄得悲痛沉淪而不易自拔。空谷蘭中的女主角，就是屬於這其中的一例。　　是的，「不能相愛，不如不愛」，毅然的離開，這是最痛快的辦法，但走出的生活，不免就要發生問題、何况在這日寇侵我山河、經濟崩潰的我國，失業的人數正不知有千千萬萬，男子都不易找尋職業，當然，婦女更談不上了。所以魯迅曾經說過；「走出後的娜娜是自殺了」。娜娜是自殺了，然而中國女子還没有像西洋女子那麽多的勇氣，於是多數走上了墮落的道路，而淪落爲妓女了，多數女子都是以凄慘的悲劇來結局牠們的生命的。空谷蘭之歌　　空谷蘭　　王乾白作歌　嚴工上製譜　胡蝶唱　　（一）空谷蘭，淡淡的清香透春寒；雲霞爲伴，風雨作餐，笑百花爭妍，歎人事紛繁，孤芳自賞，祇合在靈山。看！看他是多麽的清高哇，空谷的幽蘭！　　（二）空谷蘭，無端的移植到塵寰；者番磨難，幾度辛酸，雖云相見歡，相見亦徒然，淚迹斑斕，芳姿日萎殘。看！看他是多麽的憔悴呀，空谷的幽蘭！　　（三）空谷蘭，久陷的靈根歷刦還；意興闌珊，情境愁煩，骨肉從今散，心旌兩地懸，寂寞闌干，三疊唱陽關。看！看他是多麽的悲酸哪，空谷的幽蘭！　　抗敵歌　　安娥作詞　任光製曲　胡蝶高占非合唱　　（女）我有敵人凶似狼，强佔我地方，搶掠屠殺後，再燒燬我村莊。可憐我，同胞們，千萬命遭殃！不打倒，野心狼，印度作榜樣！　　（男）兵和民，不要分，齊心打敵人。聯友軍，殺仇人，仇和友認眞。　　（女）穿槍林，冒彈雨，不怕水火深。弟兄們，向前進，衝破敵中心。　　（女）不退後，　（男）不投降，　　（女）敵軍火，　（男）雖猛烈，　　（合）我們心堅强。整山河，守四方，雪國恥，復邊疆，萬古英名揚。　　（女）前軍仆，　（男）後軍上，　　　（女）攻上前，　（男）交手仗，　　（合）白刃閃血光，拼一命，死戰塲，奪回我，失地方，爲民族自强！殺！攻上！　　大地行軍曲　　安娥作詞　任光製曲　高占非唱　　山高水低，一條又一條，弟兄們吹起軍號，風霜雨雪，羊腸小道，日月星辰當頭照。當頭照，那紅日猶如烈火燒，烈火燒，汗流山道。黑砂飄，那狂風猶如猛虎嚎，猛虎嚎，山崩地爆。穿過摩天嶺，繞過横山腰，弟兄們，快努力！下山跑，上山跑，下山跑，上山跑，個人幸福可不要，同胞利益要顧到，不念妻和子，不怕路途遙，弟兄們快吹起進軍號，自由解放是目標，光明幸福來創造，不怕艱和難，不怕苦和勞，弟兄們快吹起進軍號！　　鳳求凰　　安娥作詞　任光製曲　嚴月閒唱　　花兒正好，月兒正圓，人兒正媚，意兒正綿，啊！多情的人兒啊，别再遲延。燈兒正暗，歌兒正甜，夜兒正靜，心兒正懸，啊！有心的人兒啊，勇敢向前。綠槐上樓着烏鴉，梧桐上飛着鳳鸞，鄉下姑娘，只配田家漢，摩登小姐，絶不受人憐，花兒有種，人兒有緣，情兒要密，心兒要連，啊！摩登的小姐呀，不受人憐。空谷蘭的趣聞  炎　　（一）胡蝶在空谷蘭中除了飾紉珠和幽蘭夫人外，還飾一婢女翠兒，她穿着一件樸素的布旗袍，劉着短短的頭髮，走起路來，身體一扭一扭地那模樣兒，就活像一個丫頭，因此胡蝶這幾天一到明星公司，大家都要喊她一聲小丫頭　　（二）嚴月閒飾一個險惡潑辣的女性，她欺負丈夫，虐待丈夫前妻所生的兒子，動不動就咬牙切齒，可眞令人見而生畏。當嚴月閒看過試片之後人家告訴她說，「唉！你年初一可不好出去，出去要被觀衆駡殺來！」　　（三）自從「姊妹花」和「再生花」公映之後，宣景琳就被廣大的觀衆公認爲中國飾演老太婆的第一人，那副慈愛的樣子，任何人看了也要說一句「演得眞感動人呀，」觀衆諸君，别瞧她老態龍鍾的樣子，下了裝，她還是頂美麗的女明星哩！　　空谷蘭職員表；　　編劇導演····················張石川　　攝影····················董克毅　　置景····················董天涯楊鏡心　　收音····················何兆璜何兆璋何懋剛　　印接····················顧友敏黃生甫　　空谷蘭演員表；　　陶紉珠翠兒····················胡蝶　　紀蘭蓀····················高占非　　金柔雲····················嚴月閒　　靑柳夫人（蘭蓀母）··············宣景琳　　陶時介····················趙丹　　陶正毅····················嚴工上　　良彥····················沈駿　　金博士····················王獻齋　　管家····················尤光照　　陶僕····················王夢石　　富少年····················孫敏　　播音員····················舒繡文　　游藝員····················胡茄　　醫生····················王徴信譚志遠　　胡塗紳士····················朱少泉　　跳舞博士····················王吉亭　　游園會主人····················徐莘園　　貴夫人····················黃耐霜朱秋痕顧梅君顧蘭君王慧娟袁紹梅電影小說空谷蘭  白　　在國民革命軍北伐的進展中｜｜　　紀蘭蓀陶時介同是「爲主義而奮鬥」的戰士，結果時介是完成了他爲主義而犧牲的精神，不過在他臨終時，一方面希望各同志繼續的前進，一方面將遺物托蘭蓀保留，轉交給他的老父弱妹。　　在戰事告一小段落時，蘭蓀因受時介之託，立刻赴陶家，會晤時介的父親正毅，時介的妹妹紉珠；正毅老境頽唐，痛子情深，紉珠綺年玉貌，承歡無術；因留蓀小住，以慰老父之心。　　愛神飛到人間，蘭蓀與紉珠以相處漸久，兩情融洽，竟致定婚；蘭蓀有母，本擬將蘭蓀的表妹柔雲，爲其配偶，在柔雲亦早以未來的陶家主婦自居，消息傳來，蘭蓀竟别締良緣，自足以使人失望，　　蘭蓀與紉珠婚後，紉珠頗不慣豪華虛僞的生活，時常有不是紳士們所認爲應該有的態度的事件發生，再加上柔雲的極力諷刺，使得蘭蓀也有些不能原諒她，而對她也感到一些不滿意。　　紉珠生子，取名良彥，彌月的時候，大宴賓客，柔雲跟紉珠皆登台歌唱，以娛來賓，可是柔雲仍舊對蘭蓀不斷的進攻，絶没有想到紉珠會來發現了他倆的秘密。　　紉珠眞是非常的難過，她知道彼此出身的不同，確是造成悲劇的基點，此後的痛苦，也許比現在還要厲害，爲着免除各方面的痛苦，她决計離開這不適合於她的環境，遂留書出走。　　等到走到火車站，紉珠才發覺没有把良彥的照片帶了出來，祗好叫隨身的女傭翠兒再回去拿，可是再等翠兒拿了照片來，火車已經開去，翠兒只好搭下一次車行，誰知車行在中途，出軌肇禍，翠兒死於非命，翠兒的面貌身材，本極似紉珠，又因大衣跟名片的關係，大家都以爲翠兒就是紀蘭蓀夫人陶紉珠女士，惡耗傳到，蘭蓀正毅非常的悲痛，祇有柔雲却暗自慶幸。　　蘭蓀自紉珠死後，對子思妻，極爲疲苦，柔雲則百般的勸慰，以博取蘭蓀的歡心，蘭蓀受母親的命令，祇得跟柔雲結婚，柔雲達到目的以後，於是改變了往日的態度，事事要蘭蓀聽從自已的主張，蘭蓀憒新念舊，更爲痛苦。　　柔雲爲着獵取在社會上的地位，乃創辦柔雲學校，自任校長，并徴聘敎務主任；這時候紉珠奉父以居，十年如一日，閱報知道柔雲學校聘請職員，因懸念良彥，乃改換她名爲李幽蘭，前往應徴。　　幽蘭到柔雲學校後，時與良彥相見，也許是天性使然，良彥對於幽蘭，極相親愛，然而幽蘭却仍感到不能說明彼此的關係爲憾。　　幽蘭因良彥的請求，也曾到紀家去，當她發現蘭蓀不忘舊妻的追念，以及柔雲處待良彥的情形，她眞是痛苦萬分，無可奈何。　　良彥病，時呼幽蘭及母，蘭蓀親來看護，惟良彥病甚重，想不到這天在午夜的時候，柔雲竟想來倫藥，蘭蓀自然是拚命的相爭，紉珠揭開了自已的眞面目，柔雲是慚恨得無地自容，於是憤而自殺。　　良彥的病漸漸的痊愈了，然而紉珠她知道再留在這兒，也許還有痛苦的事情發生，她只有離開良彥，再去度她那灑閒的歲月了。葛雷絲摩亞的勸告：「跟隨情感衝動的指引而前進」  四　　葛雷絲摩亞（GraceMoore）是好萊塢第一塊紅牌子歌星了。她是從舞台歌劇而登銀幕的。她最近成名的影片，就是去年在上海放映的「歌后情痴」（OneNightofLove）了。她說她的成功，是由於她聽取她情感衝動的導引而然的。因此，她亦勸告人家，要跟着情感衝動的指引而前進。　　這個勸告，當然是說一個人須有前進的勇氣，不必遇事狐疑不决，坐失機宜。那並不是說無論做什麽事，可以任意胡來，不假思索的意思。所以「論語」上，季文子三思而後行：孔夫子知道了，就以爲審愼固然是要的，但是遇見一件事，必定要考慮再三，未免迂迴曲折，難以成事。所以他，就說道：「再·斯可矣。」當然，這種話不是可以和性情輕浮，易於躁進的人說的。　　葛雷斯摩亞所說「跟隨情感衝動」的理由，是比較的科學化些。她將一個人的意識思想，分爲二部。一個就是下意識的感覺，有時我們稱之爲「良知，」有時我們稱之爲「觸機。」其他一部份，就是我們平常人的思想。她說人的思想，往往是不健全的，但是下意識的感觸，却往往是靈機的觸發，指引一條正路的，雖然它和理論。是正相反的。　　葛雷絲摩亞是從小跟着她的情感的觸動走的。她依着她不可遏止的衝激，做過不可討氣的事。在一個人小的時候，依着衝激做事，當然祗有壞事做得出。但是等到一個人大了，她就會做出轟轟烈烈的大事，和各種可欽可愛的事的。　　她在巴黎的時候，她和一班朋友出去玩。她僱用了一個嚮導，領着一般歡樂的尋求者，去到各處巴黎着名的夜總會裏。他們走到一個地方，葛雷絲看見一個單身的女郎，冷清清地坐着。她忽然看見他們僱的嚮導，是一個美少年。她於是異想天開立時叫侍者去將那位女郎，請了來，介紹給了那個嚮導，他們同坐着。她亦不過一時興之所至而已。不想過了一年多，她在法國南部一個别墅裏住着。忽然有一天，有人打着她的門。她開門一看，見是一男一女，女的手裏抱着一個小孩。他們告訴她，自從那晚葛雷絲給他們介紹之後，他們就一見生情，不久就結婚了。現在他們已經生了兒子，飲水思源，不能不歸功於葛雷絲，因此特地來謝她的。葛雷絲聽見了，才恍惚憶起從前的一樁趣事，她一時高興，居然成就了一對佳偶！葛雷絲的傾心於歌劇，亦是由於她一時情感的衝動的。她本來是想學宗敎的。因爲她想到外國去傳敎，週遊世界各地。後來她忽然傾心於歌劇起來。那時的歌后是曼麗伽登（MaryGaraen）。她就依照了她情感衝動的指引，寫了許多封信給曼麗伽登。她們不久就成了神交的朋友了。後來曼麗伽登在耐希維爾演劇的時候，她亦遵從了她的情感的指引，親自去見她去了。而她的以後進學校，練習歌唱，亦都是依照她心意的衝動而行的。　　當她從戲劇學校裏畢業之後，忽然有一個意大利名歌家馬丁納里在美京華盛頓登台。葛雷絲一時又異想天開起來，要想和馬丁納里一同登台。她知道她學校裏的校長，和馬丁納里是朋友。她就去求她的校長設法。她哀求着，以至於雙膝跪下了。那位校長没有法想，祗可替她設法了。可巧那位意大利歌家，亦很喜歡獎勵後進，就答應了她的請求，和他一同登台。她和馬丁納里登台的晚上，她的雙膝是戰慄着，她的喉音是低微的。等到明天早晨，她翻着報紙，看看劇評家的論調如何。她看見一家報紙上，寫的是：「昨晚登台的，是一只獅子和一隻小鼠。那只獅子頻頻讓步，使小鼠有開口的機會。但是小鼠的聲音，倒是很嘹亮可愛的。恐怕那只小鼠，倒是不可限量的東西呢。」　　葛雷絲的迭事很多，現在已經不能一一縷述了，不過她處處照着她一時的興致而行。她去到紐約登台之前，她的父親以爲她瘋了，但是她的志向堅不可搖。等到她後來成名了，她的父親才和她重行和好起來。她的到紐約，祇有二十五塊錢，但她知道一定會成功的。她居然成功了。她的到歐洲去，亦是如此冒着危險去的。就是她的回好萊塢，拍攝「歌后情痴」，亦何嘗不如此。她在好來塢嘗拍過兩張片子，都是失敗的，但她知道第三張一定會成功的，因爲她下意識地覺得如此。她毫不遲疑回到好萊塢，雖然她在舞台上亨着盛名，不必再要上銀幕去求名。她竟一舉成名了。她至今還是說：「跟隨你的衝動吧！」影片談評評「羣雌粥粥」凌鶴　　GirlsPleade｜南京映　　以前德國石剛女士曾經有過一部「女性」（卽「制服的處女」，）那是以反對專制敎育爲主題的，一羣女學生爲了爭取自由，和那對建的校長抗爭。這一影片在自由解放的意義上，有着很好的成就，同時在藝術的表現上，也有着極好的成績，因而「女性」被舉爲世界名片了。　　但是這種影片不可多得了，而現在我們所看到的是雪泥霍特主演「羣雌粥粥」了。是的，這一影片也多少是反對敎育的守舊，要給學生自由，但是自由到什麽地方去呢？使浪漫的某女生和情人私奔，無原則的將自由解釋爲生活的淫靡。換句話說，也就是無原則的開玩笑而已。　　不過話得說回來，假使將這一影片某一部份分開來說，那末有些地方仍然保持雪泥霍特的幽默味兒，如他帶領着女學生賽跑，如早操，都表現着主人公確很熱心敎育，但結果是他自已反被作弄。如他在酒店喝酒，凖備醉倒，凖備跌交，也凖備醒來時刷了身上的泥土，這裏人生哲學的苦笑，也是極好的。然而這是個别的成功，如整個的結構起來，其故事便見庸俗了。特别是男扮女裝的地方，更顯得肉麻。　　說到雪泥霍特，他在每一作品中都保存着他固有的作風。尤其是他的「假皇帝」，直到如今仍給與我們深切的印象。他的演技之深入，固不必說，而可在他身上看到英國紳士的幽默，這决不是美國的滑稽者流所能做到的。但是優秀的演員常給庸俗的劇本所累的，「羣雌粥粥」的没有成功，我們是應當爲雪泥霍特可惜的了。　　明星有聲新片「空谷蘭」之嚴月閒春節起開映於新光戲院。評「藝苑血影」  尤兢　　CircusQueenMurder　　｜國泰映｜　　馬戲班皇后裘瑟拉透厭惡她的丈夫，和該班的演員佛蘭郡，跟另一少年色巴斯坦鬧着三角戀愛。　　某日，班中發生了一樁不幸事件，班主託人請了著名偵探高德來。正在研究中，突然發生了佛蘭郡失踪，留下一件血衣，像是自殺了的案件。　　第二天的晚塲，裘瑟拉透接着色巴斯坦的節目，表演空中鞦韆，被一枝毒箭射中了，墜地而死。　　這時，偵探高德的女書記凱萊也失踪了，高德偵出她被那殺裘瑟的兇手佛蘭郡扣留着。佛蘭强迫高德把色巴斯坦讓他打死。凱萊乘機給高德打着口語通消息。　　高德穿着鋼絲馬甲，喬裝了色巴斯坦，由佛蘭郡來開槍狙擊，佛蘭郡報了怨仇之後，升到空中去表演他的空中飛人絶技。高德在下面宣佈着他的行爲，於是佛氏在表演完後，開槍自殺了。　　平庸，俗套的暗殺事件的偵探片，已經給人看得厭倦了。這兒製作者極力的把背景移到馬戲塲中來，企望以馬戲塲中各種動態，掩飾一些故事的不通，和演出的沉悶。在這點上說，「藝苑血影」總算是用着這一方法，補救了若干地方的。無如，正像那笨的䭾鳥一般，只能藏着一個頭，這片子庸俗與不通的本身，終究是無法掩飾的。　　倒是導演RoyWilliamNeilf在這片中，雖是没有什麽卓特的建樹，然而把這類故事，能做到如映出的成績，總算是努力的盡職了。馬戲塲的内外，塲中與後臺，以及獸苑的空氣，處理得極見用心。虎嘯，獅吼，馬嘶，猿啼，用聲音，用影子，充分地襯托出了馬戲班中的氛圍來，雖然正面寫馬戲的只有三個人表演的三段，並不曾應用到這些獸類。只是班主把情形告訴了高德，高氏獨自在塲中各處巡行那段，覺得太長，太沉悶了些。　　主演者亞道夫孟郁（AdolpheMenjou）在這兒没有過去的成績，不但使人覺得可惜，且有遲暮之感了。　　「玩意世界」｜｜南京二月二日起映　　　　　　台　　　　童話音樂佳　　徐琴芳用武有地  梅　　徐琴芳自在荒江女俠飾玉琴一角，極剛健婀娜之致，一時拜倒銀壇下者不知幾千萬人，顧自一二八之役，友聯公司被燬於火，琴芳乃入明星公司充任要角，然以武俠影片爲當軸年禁，不得再行攝製，徐琴芳頗有用武無地之慨，此次新華影業公司攝製紅羊豪俠傳有聲巨片，提介民族精神，表揚革命史蹟，宗旨異常純正，黨國要人，紛紛題獎，固不同於尋常武俠片也，其中有洪秀全妹宣嬌一角，能文擅武，以徐琴芳这個性最爲相近，新華公司張善琨遂延之現身銀幕，舞劍㧞刃，盤馬彎弓，精神極其飽滿，見之者曰，徐琴芳用武有地矣，琴芳一笑嫣然，蓋甚爲得意云，「空谷蘭」中之胡蝶  炸彈　　胡蝶的演技，早爲廣大的觀衆所稱讚爲」具有絶大的表演天才」。她在過去公映的「自由之花」及「狂流」中那種深刻的表情，沉着的演技，顯示了胡蝶的表演是極優秀的；尤其是在「姊妹花」中充份的發展了她的天才，她演飾「大寳」和「二寳」貧富的兩種姿態，確算異常地成功！「再生花」的出映，自然更證實了她的天才。　　「空谷蘭」是胡蝶繼「再生花」的有聲歌唱影片，由休養已久的影壇宿將張石川導演。「空谷蘭」之「情節曲折，哀感頑艶」，是早爲廣大觀衆所知道，改攝成有聲電影以後，配上歌唱對白音樂，眞是錦上添花了！　　胡蝶在「空谷蘭」中的演技，依舊是非常努力的。她在「空谷蘭」演飾三個人物：紉珠，幽蘭夫人，翠兒；這三個人物，不但三個性姿態完全不同，而且講三種不同的話，不同的語言，這將是新奇的驚人貢獻，在中國的影壇上。「新婚的前夜」巴黎映出　　藝華公司攝製，但杜宇導演，黎明暉，　叢美，徐粲鶯，徐卓呆，倉隱秋等主演之全部有聲對白歌唱軍事鉅片，「新婚的前夜」，巴决定廢曆元旦日（即二月四日）起在巴黎大戲院公映。按巴黎爲西區一家頭等戲院，從未映過國片。此番却爲「新婚的前夜」破格。原因無非是「新婚的前夜」成績優越所致。事實上，「新婚的前夜，」，無論發音，攝影，佈景，乃至演技等，均有極優美的成績。新年新節，此優秀國產聲片「新婚的前夜」的出現，誠爲滬地人士之福音，其轟動社會，膾炙人口，自在意料中也。申報電影專刋投稿略例　　一本刋爲輔助文化宣揚藝衛之電影刋物對於外來稿件均甚歡迎一經登載酬報從豐　　一

<h3>Yin Tong, Takahashi, and Others Agree on Principles for Negotiating the Chahar Incident</h3>
<p>Meeting location and personnel decided</p>
<p>Japanese troops withdraw eighteen li from Dongzhaizi</p>
<p>Japanese airfield at Datan completed</p>
<p>A false police station established at Shangliang Wuni River</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The principles for negotiating the Chahar Incident have been decided through discussions between Yin Tong, Yue Kaixian, Zhu Shiqin, and Takahashi. (30th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The initial consultation personnel for the Chahar Incident negotiations have been internally determined by our side. The Japanese side consists of Takahashi, Matsui, and Igi. When the final official consultations take place, Regiment Commander Nagami will join. Igi returned to Shanhaiguan from Changchun on the 30th and will arrive in Pingjin within days to participate in the meeting. (30th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) A telegram from Zhangjiakou on the 30th stated that all areas east of Chahar were quiet this morning. Around 9 a.m., two Japanese aircraft passed over Guyuan, conducting reconnaissance for a long time. They then circled at low altitude over Dushikou and Beizhaizi for about half an hour before flying towards Daggezhen. The tense situation in Guyuan and Dushikou remained unchanged on the 30th. Japanese troops used armored vehicles to patrol within a few miles of the area. The Japanese and puppet troops in Daggezhen, Xiaochang, Hongnitan, and Koudaoyingzi were frequently mobilizing, intentionally creating a sense of suspicion and continuing to use false threats and deceptive schemes against our side. (30th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) There are signs that the initial negotiations for the Chahar Incident meeting have been changed to Pingjin for discussion, followed by a meeting in Datan, as requested by Lieutenant General Sugihara, the commander of the Japanese 7th Division. Boundary demarcation will also be carried out after the meeting is convened. (30th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Military Attaché Major Matsui boarded a plane from Chengde to Changchun to seek instructions from the Kwantung Army Headquarters. He is expected to return to Datan on the 30th. After meeting with Japanese Regiment Commander Nagami, he will proceed to Pingjin to conduct initial negotiations. However, the location of the negotiations has been discussed for days by Yue Kaixian, Zhu Shiqin, and Yin Tong from our side with Military Attaché Takahashi of the Japanese Embassy in Pingjin. Takahashi has already telegraphed Changchun about this and is awaiting a reply from Matsui today or tomorrow before a decision can be made. (30th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The morale of the people in Zhangjiakou is trending towards stability. Only at night do the police assist the military in patrolling the suburbs and inspecting pedestrians. Citizens are living peacefully, and their interest in celebrating the Lunar New Year has not diminished. (30th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The new Japanese military airfield in Datan has been completed after continuous repairs by the Japanese army. On the 29th, three aircraft arrived from Chengde and stationed there. On the 30th, Officer Yuan from the puppet Chengde Police Department led 50 police officers to Changliang and Wuni River, under the command of the Japanese army, to establish police stations and implement the puppet regime. A puppet military police detachment headquarters was established in Daggezhen. (30th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) A telegram from Zhangjiakou on the 30th stated that one team each of Japanese and puppet troops, totaling approximately 300, arrived at Yihua Township Qiaojia Yingzi, about eighteen li from Guyuan, on the evening of the 29th and occupied civilian houses. (30th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beijing) A telephone call from Zhangjiakou stated that the situation east of Chahar is gradually easing. Japanese troops in Dongzhaizi have now withdrawn to a position approximately eighteen li away from the area. There are no traces of Japanese or puppet troops within twenty li outside the city of Guyuan. The Japanese officer in charge of command in Datan is Regiment Commander Nagami of the 25th Regiment stationed in Gubeikou. (30th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beijing) Yin Tong responded to a call from He Yingqin yesterday morning and went to Jurentang to meet with He, discussing the Chahar Incident. At 11 a.m. today, Yin visited Takahashi at the Japanese Embassy to discuss solutions to the Chahar Incident. At 1 p.m., he returned to the Japanese Embassy with Zhu Shiqin to continue talks with Takahashi. Takahashi stated that negotiations on the Chahar Incident are currently underway and are generally without problems. The meeting is scheduled to be held in Datan from February 1st to 3rd. This meeting will only address the Chahar Incident and not other matters. The contents of the meeting will be announced after it is held. (30th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beijing) Because both China and Japan are unwilling to escalate the Chahar Incident, continuous consultations have been conducted in Pingjin by Takahashi. Both sides want to establish concrete measures outside of military and political affairs. Takahashi has now telegraphed the Kwantung Army in Changchun for review. Once the Kwantung Army replies to Pingjin, the incident can come to a conclusion. After the principles for resolving the incident are fully determined, a formal meeting will be held in Datan by local representatives from both sides. It is rumored that the Japanese representatives have been determined as Tanimura Mitsuo, Commander of the Japanese 14th Division, and Nagami, Commander of the 5th Regiment. Nagami is currently waiting in Datan. It is rumored that our side's representatives have been internally determined, and it is said that the meeting may be held within two or three days. After Matsui arrives in Chengde, he has telegraphed the Japanese army front to notify our side to send representatives to attend the Datan meeting. (30th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beijing) A telephone call from Zhangjiakou stated that Japanese troops have gradually withdrawn from the Changliang Wuni River Mingshatan area. However, a portion remains stationed in the North and South Stone Pillar areas. (30th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beijing) Both sides' opinions on peaceful resolution of the Chahar Incident have become closer. He Yingqin met with Song Zheyuan, Xiao Zhenying, Yue Kaixian, and others at Jurentang at 8 a.m. this morning to discuss everything. Takahashi agreed to telegraph the Japanese Kwantung Army to request instructions on the principles set by our side. Once a reply is received, official talks will be held, with the Japanese side planning to hold them in Datan in early February. (30th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beijing) A telephone call from Zhangjiakou stated that Japanese troops still occupy the Hongnitan heights east of Chahar. Japanese aircraft continue to conduct reconnaissance over the North and South Stone Pillars, Changliang, and Wuni River areas every morning. At the same time, the Japanese army is busy transporting supplies, with Japanese army vehicles constantly coming and going. They are forcing local civilians to build roads and are still searching households for strong men to fill road construction positions. (30th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Tao Shangming arrived from Tangshan at 8 p.m. on the 30th, passed through Tianjin, got off the train, and went straight to Pingjin to attend the preparatory meeting for the Chahar Incident negotiations. (20th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beijing) A telegram from Zhangjiakou stated that three Japanese aircraft, while conducting reconnaissance over Dushikou and Datan on the morning of the 28th at 9 a.m., dropped two bombs on Duanmuliang, 20 kilometers west of Datan, killing 20 people and injuring more than 10. (30th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beijing) The Chahar East area was very quiet on the 30th. As a result of continuous contact between the two sides on the issue of peace, they have reached a consensus on principle. It is expected that the meeting will be able to resolve the issue. It is said that the location of the meeting and the candidates for representatives have been decided. If further consultations are held, they can be announced.

<h3>Outer Mongolian Troops Still Remain Stationed in Halarha</h3>
<p>Protest Note Regarding the Return of the Puppet Manchurian</p>
<p>(Changchun) According to a public announcement by the Kwantung Army today, the puppet Manchurian army has issued a protest note to the Outer Mongolian Red Army, which occupied Halarha on the 26th, demanding their withdrawal. The Outer Mongolian Red Army returned the protest note on the 28th, providing a sincere response. (Hua Lian News Agency dispatch, 30th)</p>
<p>(Changchun) The Outer Mongolian troops occupying the Halarha Temple area east of Lake Buir had been reported by the Japanese and puppet authorities as having withdrawn voluntarily after a large contingent of Japanese and puppet troops arrived. However, according to reliable sources, the Outer Mongolian troops were not intimidated by the Japanese and puppet forces and are still stationed there. Furthermore, according to sources, the Kwantung Army has today ordered a Japanese battalion stationed in Hulunbuir to be transferred to Lake Buir. (Hua Lian News Agency dispatch, 30th)</p>
<p>(Changchun) The deployment situation of the Kwantung Army on the 30th is as follows: On the 26th, the chief of the New Barag Banner in Xing'an North Province delivered an official document to the Mongolian troops who had invaded the Halarha Temple, demanding that they withdraw from Manchuria. However, on the 28th, the Mongolian troops returned the document to the Manchurian sentries without any response and continued to occupy the Halarha Temple. (Japan United News dispatch, 30th) (Tokyo) Regarding the Manchurian-Mongolian conflict, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs received a report on the 30th, stating that the truth is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The border between Manchuria's Xing'an Province and Outer Mongolia is demarcated by the Halarha River and Lake Buir, spanning hundreds of miles. Last year, the area was affected by floods. The Urga River, originating from the Ulan River, originally flowed into the Keri River but has now merged with the Halarha River, forming a delta.</p>
<p>(2) From the perspective of the national border being determined by the Halarha River, this delta naturally became a topographical change on the land of Manchuria. The border line is the movement of the main stream of the Halarha River. However, the Mongolian troops believe that the Halarha River has moved northeast, considering this delta as Outer Mongolian territory and stationing troops there.</p>
<p>(3) However, when changes occur in border rivers, the old riverbed should be the boundary line. This is a major principle of international law. Therefore, it is clear that the delta does not belong to Outer Mongolia.</p>
<p>(4) The reason why the Mongolian troops are using force here is that the area where the Halarha River passes, namely the northeast shore of Lake Buir, is a promising location for winter fishing. Therefore, they invaded to seek profit. Now, Manchurian border guards occasionally patrolled there and discovered the intrusion of Mongolian troops, hence the occurrence of this conflict. (Japan United News Agency dispatch, 30th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) A spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated today that the case of Outer Mongolian troops invading "Manchukuo" territory will be resolved directly by "Manchukuo and Outer Mongolia." The Soviet Union and Japan will not be involved. When a foreign reporter inquired whether the case would have serious developments, the spokesperson replied that they hoped it would not, but everything depends on Outer Mongolia's attitude. At the same time, the Kwantung Army Headquarters in Changchun today issued a statement regarding the case, describing the circumstances of its occurrence and stating that the Outer Mongolian troops have not provided a satisfactory explanation for their act of encroaching on territorial integrity, have not withdrawn their troops, and have instead increased their forces in the Hama Temple area. It is said that this statement indicates that the Kwantung Army is now preparing to take stern action against the Outer Mongolian troops. (Reuters dispatch, 30th)</p>
<p>(Changchun) According to the Kwantung Army's announcement, the Halarha River east of Lake Buir is the boundary between "Manchukuo" and Outer Mongolia. Outer Mongolian troops frequently cross the border into "Manchukuo." On the 23rd of this month, the border guard army stationed in Xing'an Province dispatched military advisor Lieutenant Colonel Honda to investigate the situation. Honda ordered his subordinate Lieutenant Se'o to reconnoiter Halarha Temple. The reconnaissance troops discovered Outer Mongolian soldiers 200 *fen chi* (a unit of distance) from Halarha Temple. They demanded their withdrawal, but the Mongolian soldiers refused. Lieutenant Se'o, leading one soldier, stepped forward, intending to negotiate directly with the Mongolian soldiers. Unexpectedly, as they approached the temple, they were suddenly fired upon by a dozen Mongolian soldiers. At the same time, reinforcements were seen south of the Halarha River. The reconnaissance team immediately ceased fighting and reported to the border guard command. On the 26th, the Governor of Xing'an Province sent negotiators to demand that the Mongolian troops withdraw to the south of the Halarha River. However, on the 27th, not only was there no withdrawal, but there was an increase in troops.</p>

<h3>Ke Lan Once Fell</h3>
<p>Police Bureau Chief Killed</p>
<p>(Taiyuan) The counties of Baode and Xingxian, Kelan, etc. on the northwestern border of Shanxi Province are connected to Shenmu and Fugou counties in the Shaanxi bandit area. Since the Yellow River froze in winter, Shaanxi bandits have repeatedly attempted to cross the river on the ice to disturb Shanxi. The border defense situation is tense. In recent days, each county has repeatedly telegraphed the provincial authorities for alerts. According to a telegram from Kelan, more than 2,000 Shaanxi bandits have crossed the river and occupied the county. According to another report, the county magistrate was also killed by the bandits. After receiving the report, the two departments of the Provincial Government, in addition to deploying nearby garrison troops to the border counties in the bandit area for defense, this morning also selected armed police and constables from the province to travel by car to Kelan to maintain law and order and to undertake special local guard duties. In addition, various military institutions of the military police and constabulary in the provincial capital, with the approach of the end of the old lunar year and unrest in the border bandit atmosphere, are also paying special attention to security in the provincial capital. (Special dispatch, 29th)</p>
<p>(Taiyuan) According to official reliable reports, several dozen Communist bandits were discovered in Kelan County, northern Shanxi, at 3:00 AM on the 28th. They entered the city to plunder. Wang Wudi, the chief of the county's public security bureau, led the police and garrisoned constables in a fierce battle with the bandits for several hours, killing several bandits. The bandits were unable to hold and fled through the city gate. The chief of the public security bureau was killed. The two provincial government departments convened a meeting tonight to discuss concrete measures for the aftermath. In addition to telegraphing for military police and constables to rush to pursue and suppress the bandits, the county magistrate Guo Lantian was dismissed from his post for investigation, and Zhang Shufang was appointed as the new county magistrate and chief of the public security bureau, rushing to take over his duties at night. It is reported that after the bandits entered the city, they immediately released prisoners from the prison and looted during the opportunity, causing considerable losses to merchants and civilians. There are currently no traces of bandits in the city. (Special dispatch, 29th)</p>
<p>(Taiyuan) The bandits who looted Kelan County were indeed Communist bandits, numbering more than 200. They looted in the city for seven or eight hours. The police and constables fought fiercely with the bandits, with more than ten people killed. Civilian casualties were even greater, but there are no confirmed statistics yet. The reason for the bandits' entry into the city was that there were several Communists in the county prison, so after entering the city, they first released the prisoners and shouted Communist slogans. They have now all fled towards the territory of Wuzhai County. The nearby suppression troops mobilized by the province encountered the bandits in a deep ditch more than ten miles outside Wuzhai City yesterday afternoon and engaged in a fierce battle. This morning, most of the troops have arrived, with many abandoned items of the bandits along the way. After Kelan County Magistrate Guo Lantian was dismissed, the provincial government ordered the new county magistrate to arrive, escort him to the province for investigation. The county captured two bandits yesterday, who were immediately executed on the spot. (Special dispatch, 30th)</p>

<h3>US Senate Rejects Joining the World Court Case - Heng</h3>
<p>According to a Washington dispatch on the 22nd of this month, a secret vote was held in the US Senate. Those who approved joining the World Court numbered sixty, which was more than two-thirds of the majority. According to a recent US dispatch, the official voting result for this case was 52 votes in favor, but there were also 36 votes against, resulting in failure due to not meeting the two-thirds majority. In less than ten days, such a change occurred, which was unexpected. Furthermore, the act of the United States joining the World Court has been consistently advocated by successive political authorities since Wilson. Not only was there no opposition, but they all unanimously supported it. For example, on February 17, 1923, US Secretary of State Hughes submitted a document to President Harding, advocating for joining. After receiving Hughes's document, Harding also greatly agreed with joining the court. Therefore, in his communication to the Senate, he also earnestly requested the Senate to agree. Furthermore, the resolution of the US House of Representatives on March 3, 1925, also stated that if there were reservations, the United States might as well join. The next year, on January 27, the Senate's resolution was accompanied by five reservations. And in the spring of 1929, as a result of negotiations between Secretary of State Kellogg and the League of Nations, the League of Nations had no further objections to the United States's reservation conditions. And on September 4 of the same year, the US government even instructed its minister to Switzerland to send a memorandum to the Secretary-General of the League of Nations, expressing the satisfaction foundation for the United States joining the World Court had been established. On November 18 of the same year, US Secretary of State Stimson submitted a document to President Hoover, also stating that the time for the United States to sign the World Court Charter and Protocol had matured. Therefore, on the 26th of the same month, Hoover immediately ordered the signing. On December 10, 1930, Hoover again communicated with the Senate, urging agreement. In March 1932, the review report of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee also stated that the act of the United States joining the World Court was free of malpractices. From this perspective, the case of the United States joining the World Court has been agreed upon by presidents and secretaries of state, whether Democratic or Republican. Even both houses of Congress only provided reservation conditions, and the US has already signed the World Court Charter and Protocol. Logically, the time for the United States to join the court has matured, but unexpectedly it is still rejected today. This is truly a great mystery.</p>
<p>The reasons why the United States has historically opposed joining the World Court are mainly three: (1) Fear of relations with the League of Nations. (2) Fear of interference with US interests. (3) Because the US is not a member of the League of Nations, there is a concern about the election of judges. However, according to what the reporter knows, these three difficulties have already been resolved. For example, regarding the first difficulty, Hughes stated in his communication to Harding in 1932 that "the effect of the World Court Charter does not arise from the League of Nations' passage, but from the signing of various countries." It also stated that "The World Court is established in accordance with its Charter and Protocol, so it is an independent organ of the League of Nations. And its actions are entirely based on judicial standards and are not subject to the League of Nations' distribution." Viewing these words, it can be known that the World Court and the League of Nations are completely different and cannot be confused. Hughes, for the sake of propriety at the time, further proposed a reservation condition for joining the court, stating that "The United States joining the World Court shall not be deemed to create a legal relationship with the League of Nations." This article was recognized in the protocol drafted by the Geneva Judges Committee in 1929 and cannot be said to still be a problem. As for the item of interfering with US interests, it is also extremely unreasonable. Signing the protocol and accepting the charter does not constitute that everything must be subject to the court's governance. According to Article 36 of the World Court Charter, the court only accepts cases submitted by various countries or the League of Nations. Its meaning is that if relevant countries are unwilling to submit to public adjudication, the court will never force them. In addition, in March 1926, the US Senate added two reservations to Hughes's proposal. One of them was that "The United States's ratification of the World Court Charter and Protocol may be withdrawn at any time." The second was that "Without the consent of the United States, the court may not issue opinions involving US interests." These two points were both recognized by the 1929 World Court Protocol. The protection of US interests can be said to be foolproof. Furthermore, the right to elect judges was unanimously recognized by the League of Nations and the signatories to the World Court Charter, and was recorded in the 1929 Protocol. Therefore, the important reservation conditions previously proposed by the US Senate for joining the court have all been fulfilled one by one as desired. Why has this case suddenly been overturned again today? This makes people even more confused.</p>
<p>We have previously said that the creation of the World Court and the League of Nations are both ideals of American politicians. However, their reluctance to participate is greater than that of any other country. Viewing the Senate's rejection of this case this time, it can be seen that although the United States is a country that deeply loves ideals, when there are irreconcilable conflicts with factual interests, they will readily abandon any great ideals and turn a blind eye. According to our speculation, the reason for the US Senate's rejection of joining the World Court this time is no different from its opposition to joining the League of Nations. The biggest reason why the United States does not want to join the League of Nations is that the current League of Nations' real power is controlled by the two major groups of Britain and France. Britain owns the various autonomous territories of the League of Nations member states, so it is not difficult to form a large force in the League of Nations. France has the Versailles Group in Europe at its disposal, so it is also a major force. As for the United States, it does not actually own any group. Once it joins, it will inevitably be unable to stand alone and will be subject to others. (The countries of Central and South America are extremely wary of the United States and cannot be manipulated.) The reason why they are unwilling to join the World Court is similar to this. The election of judges comes from the League of Nations, so even if the United States participates, it will inevitably be controlled by Britain and France. If most of the elected judges belong to the British and French factions, then the United States will inevitably be in a losing position. This feeling is especially strong among senators who advocate not interfering in European affairs. Perhaps the reason why this case could not pass in the Senate this time lies in this.</p>

<h3>Brazilian Congress Rejects Returning to the League of Nations</h3>
<p>Brazilian capital The Brazilian Congress today rejected the proposal for Brazil to rejoin the League of Nations. Brazil withdrew from the League of Nations several years ago because it failed to obtain a permanent council seat in the League of Nations' Administrative Council. (Reuters dispatch, 29th)</p>
<h3>Canada Disputes Labor Bureau Council Seat</h3>
<p>Because Special Committee Did Not Include in Report</p>
<p>Protests Alleging Violation of Treaty</p>
<p>(Geneva) Canada protested today that its seat as a permanent council member of the International Labor Bureau was not included in the report of the special committee. The special committee's proposed list included the eight countries of America, Britain, Germany, Russia, France, Italy, Japan, and India. It is said that Canada may appeal to the League of Nations Administrative Council, alleging that the committee's actions violate the Treaty of Versailles. The Canadian delegation stated that they welcome the United States' participation in the International Labor Bureau and its role as a permanent council member. However, they strongly oppose the "political tactics" used by Italy and India, arguing that both countries are industrially inferior to Canada. Therefore, it is unfair to replace Canada's seat with either Italy or India. According to the provisions of the Treaty of Versailles, the permanent council members of the International Labor Bureau should be the eight major industrial nations. The current selection problem is particularly difficult because both the United States and Russia have recently joined the Labor Bureau, and Germany also hopes to rejoin the League of Nations. The current council members are Britain, France, Germany, Japan, Italy, Belgium, Canada, and India. Canada's opposition indicates that none of these eight countries are willing to give up their original positions, while the United States and Russia are indeed qualified to serve as council members. Although Japan has withdrawn from the League of Nations, it still firmly maintains its membership in the International Labor Bureau. Germany is currently seeking to rejoin the League of Nations and cannot be left out of the selection. Therefore, the only solution is for the General Assembly to vote on Tuesday to decide which country should be removed. As for increasing the number of council seats, the procedure is very cumbersome and will take several years to complete. It is unlikely that the General Assembly will reach any resolution on this matter, so the final decision may have to be made by the League of Nations Administrative Council. There is also another issue that may pose a significant problem in the future. According to the Labor Bureau's regulations, each country's delegation must include both labor and capital representatives. Since Soviet Russia does not have employers in the capitalist sense, it is questionable how to make Soviet Russia comply with the regulations. (29th National Telegraph)</p>
<h3>Spanish Foreign Minister Announces Mediterranean Policy</h3>
<p>Maintaining a Neutral Stance Internationally</p>
<p>Hopes Italy and France Will Respect the Interests of Four Nations</p>
<p>Madrid The Spanish Foreign Minister delivered a declaration to Parliament regarding the Rome negotiations, stating that Spain urgently desires to know the content of the Rome Agreement concluded by Mussolini of Italy and Laval, the French Foreign Minister, regarding various issues in the Mediterranean. This is because Spain's geography and its Moroccan protectorate are both greatly related to this. Therefore, it is hoped that problems directly or indirectly related to the Mediterranean, including those outside of Spain, will not be left out. Spain itself will maintain its impartial attitude on all international issues. (30th National Telegraph)</p>
<p>Madrid The Constitution of the Spanish Republic originally stipulated that "Spain abandons war as an instrument of international politics." Today, Foreign Minister Roca stated in the House of Representatives the declaration of the Mediterranean policy passed by the Cabinet meeting, in which it was stated that this provision in the Constitution should not be interpreted as Spain abandoning various issues related to national interests.

The Foreign Minister concluded by saying that the government is currently observing the development of Soviet ideology, but there is no reason to change its current attitude.

<h3>U.S. Senate Rejects Membership in World Court</h3>
<p>Approval Vote Falls Short of Two-Thirds</p>
<p>Roosevelt's Efforts in Vain</p>
<p>Geneva Greatly Surprised by the News</p>
<p>(Washington) The U.S. Senate failed to ratify the proposal for the United States to join the Hague International Court of Justice today. The opposition faction won a major victory. There were 52 votes in favor of joining, but this was less than the necessary two-thirds majority because there were 36 votes against. When the voting results were announced, the opposition applauded greatly. It is now known that there were 43 Democrats and 9 Republicans in favor, and 30 Democrats and 14 Republicans against. Republicans stated today that this result, even if it does not permanently eliminate the issue, will certainly shelve it for a long time. Senator Robinson, who initiated the proposal, stated that this move indefinitely postpones the issue of the United States joining the International Court of Justice. The government was very surprised to hear the Senate's voting results and believes that this is a major blow to President Roosevelt's hopes, as President Roosevelt had previously asked Congress to approve this proposal for the sake of peace, and it was generally expected that the Senate would agree. The fact that as many as twenty Democrats voted against it was also surprising. During the final debate on this issue, the Senate passed a reservation, requiring the government to first negotiate general or special treaties with any party, and only when these treaties are ineffective can the matter be submitted to the International Court. (29th Reuters Telegraph)</p>
<p>(Washington) The Senate today rejected President Roosevelt's proposal for the United States to join the World Court. The Senate clerk announced the vote count as 52 to 36, falling seven votes short of the two-thirds majority required to ratify the treaty. The gallery was packed, and a thunderous cheer erupted upon hearing the report, making it almost impossible for Senate President Garner to maintain order. The result of this case was largely due to the propaganda from the Hearst newspapers and Father Coughlin's radio broadcasts.</p>
<p>Senators received thousands of letters and telegrams every day demanding a vote against the proposal. It is said that the total number of these letters and telegrams sent from all over the country was over 75,000. The leaders of the opposition were still the small group that opposed former President Wilson's proposal to join the League of Nations in 1920, namely the so-called diehards such as Borah and Johnson. Government leader Robinson stated after the rejection that "the World Court case is now dead." Although the opposition pointed out that the case was a shortcut to joining the League of Nations after the proposal was made, it was expected that the Senate would comply with the President's wishes. Moreover, all previous amendments were rejected, and Johnson also proposed an amendment stating that the World Court should handle disputes between the United States and other countries based on existing treaties. The government, fearing that excessive insistence would lead to failure, had already expressed its acceptance. Therefore, before the final vote, it was not expected that this result would occur. Robinson stated that the reason for the failure was largely due to the influence of the propaganda of the Social Justice League organized by Father Coughlin. Borah claimed that the Senate's rejection of this case was a victory for world peace because the World Court could not handle the dispute between Germany and Austria, which posed a great danger to the peace of the United States and the world. Observers believe that President Roosevelt did not personally exert enough effort on this case, so his disappointment was expected. (29th National Telegraph)</p>
<p>(Washington) The result of this Senate vote is a great success for those who advocate separation from Europe. Not only have President Roosevelt's various efforts been completely abandoned, but the issue of joining the International Court of Justice, which has been requested by successive U.S. governments, will now be shelved. Moreover, some people in the United States are engaged in a movement to have the United States join the League of Nations. Now that even joining the International Court of Justice cannot be passed, the movement to join the League of Nations will naturally be abandoned from now on. It is said that the two Republican Senators, Borah and Johnson, were the strongest opponents of joining the International Court of Justice in the Senate. The reason why these two people opposed joining was that the Hague International Court of Justice was affiliated with the League of Nations. The United States joining the International Court of Justice was a deception to prepare the United States to join the League of Nations. Moreover, if the United States joined the International Court of Justice, it would inevitably be dragged into the vortex of European disputes. If so, the United States would become a tool of European countries and would lose its freedom to judge international events. Also, during the Senate's discussion of joining the International Court of Justice, a fierce movement was launched throughout the country, especially by the Hearst newspapers. In recent days, senators in the Senate who had been hesitant had received as many as 40,000 telegrams from various places expressing opposition to joining the International Court of Justice. After today's vote, Labor leader Robinson, the Democratic majority leader who supported the case in the Senate, declared that the Senate's decision would shelve the issue of the United States joining the International Court of Justice indefinitely and could not be raised again. It is said that before the Senate held a vote, Labor leader Robinson still made a final appeal, saying that in recent days, people across the country have incited opposition to joining the International Court of Justice, hoping to influence the Senate's resolution, which is inappropriate. Opponents say that U.S. membership would endanger the lives and property of U.S. citizens and drag the United States into European disputes. These reasons are all false. Although Labor leader Robinson tried his best to defend it, the Senate still rejected the case, which was unexpected by the general public. (29th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Geneva was greatly surprised by the news that the U.S. Senate did not approve the United States joining the World Court. The League of Nations had always believed that the Senate's two-thirds majority approval was certain to become a reality. Now that the Senate has made this unfavorable decision, it is a great misfortune for the League of Nations, but it is also of no benefit to the United States. Efforts to move the United States to join the League of Nations have now suffered a major blow. President Roosevelt has not yet expressed his opinion on this matter. Mr. Baker, who previously served as a judge on the International Court of Justice, stated today that those who support joining must continue their propaganda until they gain seven more votes. Congressman Fish, who advocates joining the International Court of Justice, now expresses his opinion, saying that American public opinion has changed because European countries have refused to pay war debts.

<h3>British and French Talks to Begin Soon for a General Review of the European Situation</h3>
<p>Special Emphasis on Disarmament Issues</p>
<p>Conflicting Security Positions Between Britain and France</p>
<p>(London) British Cabinet members and French Prime Minister Flandin and Foreign Minister Laval will begin talks in London on Friday. According to well-informed sources here, it is expected that Britain will not be further restricted in its affairs in Europe. It is reported that the talks will be a general review of the European situation and will pay special attention to disarmament. Britain is willing to do its best to help resolve the current difficulties in Europe, but there is no sign of Britain abandoning its traditional position on European constraints. Therefore, it seems that it will never confirm the Locarno Treaty, but will only promise to provide air force assistance to France in the event of an attack by another country. French Foreign Minister Laval was forced by the House of Representatives yesterday to state France's position on the London talks, saying that Prime Minister Flandin and himself will discuss the German armaments issue and the international plans we hold. Peace without security guarantees cannot be realized. We deeply know that France's security is necessary for Europe. The Congress can trust us in this regard. (30th Reuters Telegraph)</p>
<p>(London) It has been more than two years since the French Prime Minister last visited London. It is said that in October 1932, Herriot came here in a hurry to discuss the situation caused by Germany's attitude towards the Maritime Disarmament Conference. Since then, no French Prime Minister has visited. Diplomatic circles now say that although France and Britain are willing to restore international trust, their opinions are actually different. Britain has the ambition to reduce armaments and hopes to invite Germany back to Geneva so that the Five-Power Convention established in December 1932 can take effect. The agreement allows Germany equal rights in accordance with the system of national security regulations. France fears that Germany will be uncontrollable within a few years, so it insists that Germany must first return to Geneva before discussing equality and must obtain absolute guarantees of France's security, as well as guarantees of international control of armaments, and Germany must also join the conventions on Austrian independence and Eastern European security. If Germany refuses, France will conclude defense conventions with Soviet Russia and Czechoslovakia. (30th Reuters Telegraph)</p>

<p>(1) Germany rejoins the League of Nations and participates in various regional mutual assistance conventions. (2) The military strength of France and Germany should maintain a considerable difference sufficient to ensure security. (3) Britain should actively assist in maintaining order.</p>
<p>According to general rumors, regarding the first point, if Germany requires that the mutual assistance convention must be changed to a consultation and non-aggression convention before it can be signed, then the Soviet Union and the Little Entente countries will inevitably refuse, and the solution will be extremely difficult. This level should be taken into consideration. Regarding the third point, because the British self-governing territories do not agree, Britain will probably only establish an agreement within the scope of existing restrictions, such as the League of Nations Covenant and the Locarno Treaty.

<h3>Britain Puts Forward New Suggestions While Remaining True to Its Traditional Position</h3>
<p>(London) According to the Liberal Party's organ, the "Star," the British government seems to have put forward a new suggestion to France on the issue of security. Britain advocates that the security issue, the German rearmament issue, and the issue of international peace guarantees should be discussed and resolved at the same time. According to the "Star," Britain proposed the following three points:</p>
<p>(1) Britain reiterates the obligations Britain has undertaken in the Locarno Treaty and allows Britain to assist with the air force in fulfilling this obligation. (2) Britain participates in the Rome Agreement in principle. When Austrian independence is threatened by foreign intimidation, Britain should participate in mutual consultations. (3) Britain participates in the collective security system to enhance the effectiveness of the currently considered armament restriction agreement. (29th Havas Telegraph)</p>
<h3>Laval Announces French Foreign Policy</h3>
<p>Willing to Participate in a Stable Central European Peace Organization</p>
<p>Security Guarantees are the Goal of Future Efforts</p>
<p>(Paris) At today's meeting of the House of Representatives, Foreign Minister Laval answered questions from members and delivered an important foreign policy speech. Nationalistic member Puychaux asked the Foreign Minister, "Can we hope to make Germany disarm with considerable concessions? The French reply to Britain on the disarmament issue on April 18, 1934, has expressed France's position, not recognizing Germany's rearmament as a legitimate action. However, given the current situation, it is feared that France will be forced to abandon its security claims, just as it was forced to abandon its reparations claims in the past. If so, how will Britain maneuver in order to make Germany make promises again and fulfill them?" To this, Foreign Minister Laval replied, "The United Kingdom and France exchange views on various European policies every considerable amount of time. This is something that everyone is happy about. The goal of the exchange of views between the United Kingdom and France does not have to be fixed and depends on changes in the environment. Generally, the German armaments issue and all the international actions that the two countries are bound by should be on the list of discussions. We have a practical feeling. We know our country's defense needs. History has shown us that if France is weak and incompetent, it cannot be valued by friendly countries. If France is isolated and helpless, it may not be helpful to peace. We are willing to participate in a stable Central European peace organization. We do not believe that peace can be achieved without mutual security guarantees from all countries. Therefore, this kind of security guarantee is the main goal of our efforts. In recent weeks, French diplomacy has been actively active, which has been seen since time immemorial. Therefore, an atmosphere has now been created in which countries are gradually reaching compromises. This is the only thing that traditional French policy seeks. The Rome Agreement has made the French and Italian nations form a solid and lasting friendship. The London talks will make the United Kingdom and France a close and friendly unity. We deeply know that French security is absolutely necessary for maintaining European peace, but France is always ready to make fair and effective contributions to all international attempts to consolidate peace. This is not only known to us, but also known to foreigners." After Laval's speech, the whole audience applauded greatly. Member Puychaux spoke, expressing satisfaction, and immediately applied to withdraw the question, and would raise the question again when Laval reported on the results of the talks after the British and French London negotiations, but said that French foreign policy should still focus on opposing the revision of the treaty, and asked the government not to forget it.

<h3>Second Anniversary of the National Socialist Party's Rule</h3>
<p>Hitler Issues Declaration</p>
<p>(Berlin) Today is the second anniversary of the National Socialist Party's rule. Hitler issued a declaration stating that the outbreak of the World War was a turning point in history, and the birth of National Socialism was also a turning point. Countless trillions of Germans are now driving this new ideology, and the unprecedented large-scale mobilization of human power that occurred the year before has occurred. As he had previously requested a four-year period to implement the procedures he had set, he dared to say that before half of this period had passed, more than two-thirds of the promised clauses had been tried, and those who opposed us had realized that we had put into practice what they had expected, that is, a glorious, free, and happy Germany. Xi said at the end that the Saar was suitable for returning to the motherland at this time, so today's anniversary can be called a celebration. (30th Reuters Telegraph)</p>
<h3>German Centralization</h3>
<p>Cabinet Passes Three Important Decrees</p>
<p>Empowers Local Governors with Administrative Privileges</p>
<p>Schacht Serves as Acting Minister of Economic Affairs</p>
<p>(Berlin) The Cabinet today passed three important decrees stipulating the status of Saar provisional administration, Saar representatives to the German Congress, and German local governors. The first decree increased the number of members of the Congress elected in November 1933 by eight, with one member for every 60,000 Saar people who voted in favor of returning to Germany. The eight members must all be appointed by the Saar Commissioner Booker at the request of the Führer Hitler. The second decree stipulates that before the Saar becomes one of Germany's twenty provinces, the Saar administration will be temporarily presided over by a commissioner appointed by the Führer Hitler. The commissioner represents the German government in administering all public affairs, and his powers are the same as those of German local governors. The third decree grants German local governors special powers, namely that they are administrative chiefs and legislators in their jurisdictions, subject only to the central government and the Federal Congress, and it is their task to implement the Führer's policies, with the power to issue temporary orders. The ministers of the central government directly issue orders to the local governors in places where they do not conflict with the supervision and control of the Minister of the Interior. The power to appoint and dismiss local governors is in the hands of the Führer, who can appoint him to serve concurrently as the governor of the state. The officials of the state governments are appointed and dismissed by the governor to the Führer. The jurisdiction of the governor is also determined by the Führer. The duties of the governor of Prussia are concurrently held by the Führer himself, but can be delegated to the Prussian Prime Minister. Goring is now the governor of Prussia. According to the provisions of the above-mentioned decrees, the power of the German state governments has been greatly restricted, and the German constitution has undergone another important amendment. (29th National Telegraph)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Minister of Economic Affairs Schmitt resigned today. Hitler approved the resignation and immediately appointed Schacht, President of the German Reichsbank, to serve as Acting Minister of Economic Affairs. It is said that the reason for Schmitt's resignation was health problems. When he asked for sick leave a few months ago, it was rumored that he would not be able to return to his position.

<h3>Davis Optimistic About Future of Naval Conference</h3>
<p>Disarmament Aims to Curb Aggression</p>
<p>Still Believes New Agreement is Possible</p>
<p>(Washington) U.S. Envoy Davis said in a speech at the International Collaborative Association today that he still believed a new naval treaty was possible, but expressed regret over Japan's abolition of the Washington Naval Treaty. Davis stressed that the United States has always pursued a good-neighbor policy and respects the rights of all countries. As long as countries do not disregard treaties in which the United States participates or infringe on our rights, they can be fearless that we will discriminate. Davis also said that the purpose of disarmament is to promote mutual trust, a sense of security, and to curb acts of aggression. Davis predicted that the international disarmament movement would soon be launched again in Geneva, and praised the effectiveness of the Washington Conference. Davis also said that cooperation with Japan and other major naval powers is an element in maintaining peace. We must not be disturbed by the current stalemate and rumors of naval competition. On New Year's Day in 1937, we will see the establishment of a new agreement. Davis concluded by saying that the Far Eastern issue is a common issue related to all countries.

<h3>Rumors of Monarch Change in Siam</h3>
<p>Singapore Today, it was learned here that Prince Ananda Mahidol, the nephew of the King of Siam, has been elected King of Siam. The new monarch is eleven years old and currently lives in Lausanne. The old king is traveling in England, and his reinstatement treaty has not been accepted by the Siamese government, hence this move. As the monarch is young, the affairs of state will be governed by the regent. The former monarch of Siam had disagreements with the Bangkok government and angrily announced his abdication. The Bangkok government sent a representative to England to persuade the king to return to his position. The meeting lasted for two hours in Nall, but there was no result. The Siamese government delegation then telegraphed to Bangkok for instructions to determine the next step. The Siamese government then decided to change the monarch. (30th National Telegraph)</p>
<p>(London) The representatives of the Siamese government who are here to meet with the King of Siam specially declared to the Associated Press reporter today that the rumors in Singapore that Siam had changed the new monarch were unfounded, and said that the negotiations between the King of Siam and the Bangkok government were still in progress, and the King of Siam had not yet decided whether to abdicate.

<h3>Indian Legislative Assembly Rejects Anglo-Indian Trade Agreement</h3>
<p>Governor-General of India to Approve Agreement Using Special Powers</p>
<p>New Delhi – The Indian Legislative Assembly today debated the Anglo-Indian Trade Agreement for a considerable time. It ultimately rejected the recently signed Anglo-Indian Trade Agreement by a vote of 66 to 58. However, the Governor-General of India, Lord Willingdon, will ultimately use his special powers to approve this agreement. During the discussion of this case, the opposition party in the Legislative Assembly proposed two amendments: (1) to immediately abolish this agreement; (2) to first seek the opinions of the Indian business community and then submit it to the Legislative Assembly for resolution. Supporters of this agreement said that this agreement merely makes the economic measures taken by the Indian government with the consent of the Legislative Assembly in recent years into a contract. However, the opposition retorted that this kind of measure was imposed on India by an autocratic government. The Indian people and its Legislative Assembly have not recognized the principle of imperial preference. If there is any, it is all out of coercion. This agreement protects British industries at the expense of Indian interests and hinders India's opportunity to negotiate with other countries. (30th Reuters)</p>
<h3>Financial Difficulties of London Strauss &amp; Co.</h3>
<p>One of the World's Largest Commodities Exchanges</p>
<p>Five Banks Request Liquidation</p>
<p>Great Shock in the Indian Market</p>
<p>(London) Strauss &amp; Co., one of the world's largest commodity brokerage firms, is currently in a state of financial insolvency. Five banks, including the Mercantile Bank and other major Indian banks, have today petitioned the bankruptcy court to appoint a provisional liquidator to handle the firm's affairs. The court has granted their request. The firm has extensive operations in India, so the news of its failure has caused shock in Bombay and Karachi. The grain market has been suspended. The Baltic Grain Exchange is also feeling the adverse effects. Rumors of the firm's failure had already circulated there on Saturday and Sunday, resulting in very sluggish trading. Mr. Baggon, the firm's Indian General Manager, recently fell to his death from the fourth floor of his hotel. The Bombay authorities conducted an autopsy today and determined it to be a suicide due to a nervous breakdown. It is reported that the deficit amounts to approximately one million pounds.

<h3>No Silver Shipped from Hong Kong to England This Month</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) The amount of silver shipped from Hong Kong to London in November and December of last year was indeed considerable, but Reuters has learned today that no silver has been shipped to England in January. Therefore, the rumor that the value of silver shipped from Hong Kong to England this month is more than 500,000 yuan is not true. According to extremely reliable Chinese sources, the supply of Chinese silver coins in Hong Kong is now exhausted. This is a good sign, as it indicates that the practice of smuggling silver from China to Hong Kong for re-export overseas has been greatly reduced due to the strict inspections of the Chinese customs. A Chinese banker expressed his opinion on this matter, stating that the silver price paid by the local equalization fund is higher than that in London, so there is no reason for silver dollars to be shipped from Hong Kong to England. The purpose of the equalization fund in purchasing silver is to prevent silver dollars from leaving the country. As for the silver dollars that have already left the country, there is no way to recover them. (30th Reuters)</p>

<h3>General Accounting Period and Shipping Companies' Suspension of Service P]</h3>
<p>At the end of the lunar year, due to accounting matters in the business world, even the regular liners of various shipping companies have to suspend their services following the custom. Generally, from February 3rd to 7th, merchants do not ship goods, and even if the ships sail, there would be no business. The suspension period for each route is detailed below:</p>
<p>Tongyang Route Suspends for One Week</p>
<p>The Xiaochangjiang ships on the Shanghai-Tongyang route, operated by the Dada and Datong companies, usually run on daily schedules. Last year, while the shipping business on other routes was sluggish, this route was quite profitable, leading Dada to plan new ships. As the lunar year-end approaches, the two companies have agreed that February 1st will be the last sailing date from Shanghai to Tongyang, after which services will be suspended for one week, resuming on February 8th. The two companies will soon issue a notice to the public.</p>
<p>Chongming-Shanghai Route Also Suspended</p>
<p>The five companies on the Chongming-Shanghai route, including Ping'an, Baofeng, and Daxing, have recently reunited. Regarding the Chongming-Shanghai services during this accounting period, it was decided yesterday that services would be suspended starting this Saturday, expected to resume next Thursday or Friday. Consequently, there has been an increase in cargo and passengers traveling between Chongming and Shanghai these days, as travelers rush to reach their destinations before the suspension.</p>
<p>Shanghai-Taizhou Ships Suspend Service First</p>
<p>The Shanghai-Taizhou service of the Lian'an Shipping Bureau's six ships will be first suspended by the Taizhou ship. Upon arrival in Taizhou this Monday, it will suspend operations. Others, like Daxing, Yili, and Zhoushan, will cease operations after their last departure today. The earliest to resume service among the six ships will be the Dahua for Shanghai and the Taizhou for Taizhou. However, the schedule for the Chuanshan route is yet to be determined.</p>
<p>Xin Beijing Suspends Once</p>
<p>On the Ningbo route, three of the four companies, namely China Merchants, Ning Shao, and Sanbei, have publicly agreed not to suspend services at the end and beginning of this lunar year, regardless of cargo or passengers, they will continue to sail as usual. However, the British Taikoo Company's Xin Beijing ship will follow past practice and suspend one trip after sailing on February 1st, expected to resume service around February 6th.</p>
<p>Yangtze River Route Ships</p>
<p>Ships on the Yangtze River route usually follow their schedule, sailing even without cargo. For this accounting period, the river steamers of each company happen to have ships available to sail. China Merchants Bureau's Jiangshun is scheduled to depart on February 4th, while Sanbei's Changxing and Jardine Matheson's Baohe are scheduled to sail on the 5th. From the 6th, the river steamers of all companies can resume sailing. As for coastal ships to the North and South Seas, departures will also be reduced starting next week.</p>

<p>Customs' Reward and Punishment Measures for Confiscated Smuggled Silver Exports</p>
<p>Only Silver Auxiliary Coins Can Be Transported to Chinese Ports</p>
<p>The Jianghai Customs issued a notice regarding the persistent smuggling of silver out of the country. Any confiscated smuggled silver will be confiscated, and the smugglers must pay a fine equivalent to the value of the confiscated silver. Informants leading to the confiscation will receive 60% of the confiscated value as a reward. Military police assisting in the confiscation will also receive bonuses. Military police acting alone will receive 60% of the confiscated silver's value for exceptional service, or 40% for ordinary confiscations. Confiscations valued at over 10,000 yuan will be considered exceptional service. Military police assisting customs in confiscations will also receive 40%. The names of informants will be kept strictly confidential. However, the transportation of silver auxiliary coins between coastal ports in mainland China will not be subject to the new regulations.</p>
<p>Foreign Rice Imported Through Fujian Customs Subject to Import Tax</p>
<p>Transshipment to Other Places Exempt from Supplementary Tax</p>
<p>Customs Issues Notice for Public Awareness</p>

<p>Change of Director at the Postal Savings Bureau</p>
<p>(Tang Resigns) Tang Baoshu telegraphed his resignation to Minister Zhu of the Ministry of Communications, stating, "I am grateful for your acquaintance and for being appointed as the head of savings and remittances for the past two years. I have diligently performed my duties, and fortunately, there have been no mistakes. Recently, I received your order that the bureau should move to Beijing to work after the completion of the new office. I should comply with this. However, my 80-year-old father is at home, suffering from chronic illness, and it is essential that I attend to him. The days of serving the country are long, but the days of serving my parents are short. After much consideration, I can only request that the National Government be informed and my position as director be revoked to fulfill my filial duties. I humbly ask for your consideration." It is heard that Minister Zhu tried to persuade him to stay, but to no avail, and the resignation has been approved.</p>
<p>(Shen Succeeds) After the resignation of Tang Baoshu, Director of the Postal Savings and Remittances Bureau, Minister of Communications Zhu Jia'hua requested that the government appoint Shen Shuyu, Director of the Customs Administration of the Ministry of Finance, as his successor. As for Shen Shuyu's vacancy, Zheng Lai, Director of the Aviation Highway Construction Lottery Office of the National Government, will succeed him. The above has been approved by the Executive Yuan. Tang Baoshu has already left his post, but the new director, Shen Shuyu, is currently in Beijing to discuss important matters and will take over upon his return to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Year-End Accounting Period Approaching, Money Shops Temporarily Suspend All Loans</p>
<p>Five Batches of Silver, Over 300,000, Arrive in Shanghai Today</p>
<p>The Ministry of Industry Permits Telegrams to Maintain Factories</p>
<p>The year-end accounting period is approaching, Shanghai's money shops are temporarily suspending loans, and bank warehouses are full. Five batches of silver are expected to arrive in Shanghai this morning. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Five Batches of Silver Arrive in Shanghai This Morning</p>
<p>To stabilize the market, the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Committee entrusted the Hong Kong branches of the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications to purchase and transport silver to Shanghai for regulation. The first, second, third, and fourth batches, totaling 2,314,000 yuan in national currency, have already arrived in Shanghai. The fifth batch of silver, valued at over 300,000 yuan, has been loaded onto the Changxing Shipping Company's Empress of Japan and transported from Hong Kong to Shanghai, expected to arrive at the Qichang Wharf in Pudong at 10:30 this morning. Representatives from the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications will be dispatched to retrieve it and store it in the warehouse. Money shops have temporarily suspended loans.</p>
<p>A reporter from Xinsheng News Agency learned yesterday from money shops that the overnight loan interest rate has fallen to 0.08%, a significant drop of 0.52% from the peak of 0.6%, proving that Shanghai's credit has eased. The low interest rate is due to money shops temporarily suspending all loans and recalling debts from customers as the year-end accounting period approaches, resulting in surplus funds for money shops and no need for interbank lending. However, credit between industries is tighter due to the need to repay money shop debts.</p>
<p>Bank Warehouses Are Full</p>
<p>Banks in Shanghai have established warehouses specifically for agricultural product mortgages, such as the Bank of Communications, Shanghai Bank, Jincheng Bank, Jiangsu Bank, Farmers Bank, Kenye Bank, Zhejiang Industrial Bank, and Zhejiang Real Estate Bank. Warehouses in various locations are full. General observations suggest a good harvest of agricultural products and thriving warehouse business. However, according to insiders, this is not a good sign, as the market is sluggish and lacks purchasing power. Farmers are unwilling to sell their harvests due to low prices and are mortgaging them instead. Banks are concerned that selling the warehouse goods in the future will further lower market prices, contrary to the purpose of the warehouses. They are currently considering remedial measures. (Above from Xinsheng News Agency)</p>
<p>Ministry of Industry Permits Telegrams for Both Industries</p>
<p>The Shanghai National Goods Factory Association telegraphed the Ministry of Industry, requesting that Shanghai's banking industry not pressure for debt repayments due to the sluggish market. The association received a reply yesterday, stating that the relevant department has been instructed to send letters to both the Shanghai Bankers Association and Money Shops Association to handle the matter with discretion. The original telegram is as follows: "To the Shanghai National Goods Factory Association: We have received your telegram. Regarding your request, we have instructed the relevant department to send letters to the Shanghai Bankers Association and Money Shops Association to handle the matter with discretion. Please be informed. [Stamped] Ministry of Industry."</p>

<p>All Industries' Associations Unite to Oppose Telephone Rate Hikes</p>
<p>Jointly Write to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce Requesting Effective Negotiation</p>
<p>Since the January 28th Incident, various industries in this city have been in decline, with factories and stores closing due to unsustainable conditions almost daily. Unexpectedly, amidst this severe economic downturn, the Shanghai Telephone Company has disregarded everything and suddenly increased telephone rates. Commercial and industrial transactions rely on telephones as their lifeline. Raising telephone rates is tantamount to levying special harsh taxes on commerce and industry. At a time when various industries are withering, they can hardly bear the increased burden. Therefore, trade associations of the silk and satin industry, bamboo industry, machinery dyeing and weaving industry, beef and mutton industry, silk and satin printing industry, glass industry, Western pigment industry, iron printing and can manufacturing industry, biscuit, candy, and canned food industry, thermos bottle manufacturing industry, woolen fabric industry, travel industry, fresh chicken store industry, Chinese and Western wooden furniture store industry, electrical appliance industry, freight car industry, inland river shipping industry, coal industry, cotton ginning industry, machine-made noodles industry, umbrella industry, sandalwood and dried longan industry, book industry, domestic rubber products industry, color printing industry, local products industry, cotton brokerage industry, postal transport industry, and others have jointly written to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, expressing their unanimous opposition and requesting prompt and effective negotiation. The original letter stated:</p>
<p>"Dear Sirs, we recently read in the newspapers that the Shanghai Telephone Company is about to increase telephone rates for citizens, which is inevitable. It has been submitted to the Public Concession and French Concession authorities for review and discussion, and it is hoped that it will be allowed to be implemented from April 1st of this year. In recent years, countries around the world have been affected by commercial depression and market decline, and they have all reduced prices to achieve balance and seek survival. Shanghai, in addition to being affected by the trend of economic downturn, has also suffered from the scars of the January 28th Incident, resulting in numerous businesses closing down and many houses being vacant, as evidenced by the current situation. However, the Shanghai Telephone Company only knows to repeatedly raise telephone rates, seeking only private gain and disregarding the survival of all citizens. Our associations feel deeply pained. Examining the company's service situation, within the city, calls between the Chinese and Concession areas still use the old manual system, without automatic dialing. Each call must wait one or two hours in advance. After the call is connected, a fee of five cents per minute is charged, and the billing records are often inaccurate, causing citizens to suffer losses invisibly. In addition, there is deliberate monopoly in areas such as West Shanghai, resulting in decayed lines and weak transmissions. On the long-distance side, there is a lack of transmission lines for calls between the Chinese and Concession areas, causing difficulties. Moreover, many new long-distance routes, such as Taicang, Yixing, Tangjia Zha, Tianshenggang, Huojia Qiao, Liuhe, Wujiang, Pingwang, and other Chinese areas, can now be connected, but the Concession areas have not followed suit, so our telephone users in the Concession areas cannot enjoy the rights they should have after the increase in long-distance lines. Moreover, the telephone bills for each quarter randomly increase the cost of calls between the Chinese and Concession areas, forcing us to bear the burden. Upon inquiry, we are met with harsh words. In summary, these are all major issues. The company disregards the overall situation and turns a deaf ear. It does not prioritize improvements but focuses on increasing the burden on citizens to pursue the company's private interests, which is absurd and outrageous. Furthermore, in economic principles, in addition to increasing revenue, reducing expenses is also important. The company's foreign employees receive monthly salaries of hundreds or thousands of yuan, while the positions they hold could easily be handled by someone earning dozens of yuan. Instead of trying to tighten spending and reduce expenses, they must oppress citizens to indirectly bear the burden, which is difficult to understand rationally and logically. We hereby jointly petition your association to inform the Public Concession and French Concession authorities to consider the city's economic downturn and not approve the rate hike to prevent private gain. At the same time, we also request that you submit this to the Municipal Government for effective negotiation to cancel the rate hike and benefit commerce and industry. Yours sincerely, To the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce."</p>
<p>Philippine Governor Supports Sino-Philippine Friendship</p>

The previous night, Philippine Governor Murphy visited Shanghai. Dr. Liu made a special trip to meet him and discuss Sino-Philippine friendship. The Governor expressed strong support for the concept and praised the association's work, stating that he would further discuss concrete ways to promote Sino-Philippine friendship upon his return to the Philippines to strengthen relations and build a foundation for peace in East Asia.</p>

<p>China Agricultural Loan Syndicate</p>
<p>Initiated and Organized by Five Banks</p>
<p>Aimed at Revitalizing Rural Areas</p>
<p>Recognizing the economic decline in rural areas, various banks in Shanghai have initiated and organized the China Agricultural Cooperation Loan Syndicate to revitalize the rural economy. The Bank of Communications, Shanghai Bank, Jincheng Bank, Zhejiang Industrial Bank, and Four Provinces Farmers Bank have jointly drafted the syndicate's articles of association and operating rules. Article 2 of the draft articles of association stipulates that the syndicate's purpose is "to serve rural society, promote agricultural cooperation, and revitalize the rural economy." The syndicate's name is yet to be determined and will be decided at the founding meeting.</p>
<p>Welcome to Participate</p>
<p>Although the syndicate is initiated and organized by five banks, it welcomes the participation of banks nationwide to jointly manage it. The articles of association stipulate that "any bank that agrees with the syndicate's purpose and wishes to participate in joint lending may be invited to participate in lending before the start of each year, subject to the approval of the participating banks." The initiating five banks are currently contacting various banks to invite them to participate. It is reported that the Bank of China will also participate in joint management.</p>
<p>Soon to be Established</p>
<p>The syndicate will establish a board of directors, composed of one director from each participating bank, and an executive director to handle daily affairs. The board of directors will be responsible for organizing local offices, planning cooperatives, distributing personnel, dividing areas, reviewing accounts and expenditures, and preparing final accounts. The syndicate's founding meeting will be held next month after the consultations are completed. (Xinsheng News Agency)</p>

<p>Municipal Chamber of Commerce Sends Telegram to Ministry of Railways</p>
<p>Requesting Refund of Tianjin-Pukou Railway Purchase Bond</p>
<p>Requesting Order for the Bureau to Adhere to the Agreement and Not Extend the Term Again</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Ministry of Railways in Nanjing, stating, "On January 29th, we received a letter from the Tianjin-Pukou Railway Purchase Bond Holders Association in Bengbu, stating that the Tianjin-Pukou Railway Bureau issued 1 million yuan in purchase bonds in the 17th year [of the Republic], stating on the bond that principal would be repaid in installments through lotteries starting in January of the 20th year. However, upon the expiration of the term, the bureau used the war as an excuse to extend the term by two years. Although bondholders in various places appealed separately, the bureau explicitly stated on February 4th of the 22nd year that the purchase bonds should be repaid through lotteries and that interest owed should be paid, and submitted a plan to the ministry for approval, which would be announced upon approval. However, just as bondholders were eagerly awaiting, the bureau issued another announcement on December 20th of the same year extending the repayment term by one year, from January 1st to December 31st of the 23rd year. Regardless of whether this contradictory behavior was initiated by the bureau or obstructed by the ministry, the trampling of private rights is an undeniable fact. Now that the extended term has passed, there is still no official announcement of repayment. Fearing that the old tricks will be repeated, we separately telegraphed the bureau and the ministry on January 22nd, demanding immediate repayment. Considering that your association is a leader of merchants, we hereby request that your association provide assistance to achieve results, which would be greatly appreciated."</p>
<p>The Chamber added, "The Tianjin-Pukou Railway is the central artery of North and South China. Since your ministry has been keen to reorganize it, the business situation of the railway has reportedly improved compared to before. These purchase bonds were used to purchase vehicles, directly increasing business, and the total amount of debt is not large. Even in terms of the bureau's financial resources, it should not be difficult to raise funds. In recent years, old debts of various railways have been repaid to maintain credibility. The Tianjin-Pukou Railway should not lag behind. The principal and interest of these due bonds have been extended twice, for a total of three years. Bondholders are eager and impatient. We hereby forward the situation to your ministry for review and approval. We request that you inform the bureau to honor its previous agreement and not extend the term again. Yours sincerely, Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce."</p>

<p>Tragic Drought Situation in Jiande, Zhejiang</p>
<p>Begging for Relief</p>
<p>To Huang, Director of the Zhejiang Civil Affairs Department and the Relief Committee, transferred by the Shanghai Shen Bao: "In Jiande County last year, the fields and crops were affected by drought, and buckwheat was damaged by frost. In addition, corn and miscellaneous grains were mostly unable to be planted due to the drought. As a result, the total harvest of crops in the county is estimated to be less than one-tenth of previous years. The disaster situation is the most severe in the province. The suffering is immense. Although officials have been sent to the county to investigate and provide winter relief, even those who received relief tickets after the strict elimination by the committee (according to the county's relief meeting resolution, 30 catties of corn for large mouths and 14 catties for small mouths, barely enough for half a month's food) account for less than 20% of the disaster victims who cannot be saved. The remaining 80% are left out. The need for assistance is more urgent than hoping for rain. Moreover, this county has no wealthy merchants who can donate and no local public funds that can be allocated. The county treasury is empty, and there is nothing to take. Even if the disaster victims have small assets, there are no financial institutions to mortgage them. In addition to begging the Civil Affairs Department for relief, there is no other way to provide assistance. As for providing work relief, although some projects are currently being built to provide work relief, the wages earned can only maintain the individual life of the able-bodied man (the unit price of earthwork in that area is 1 dime and 2 cents per cubic foot. A strong man can only fill and dig about 3 cubic feet per day, and meals cost about 2 dimes per person per day. There is no meal allowance for rainy days. Considering both sunny and rainy days, it is only enough to make a living). It is still difficult to support parents, wives, and children. The elderly, weak, women, and children are currently filling their stomachs with wild grass and hoping to eat bran, but cannot even get it. As a result, some have starved to death or fallen ill. The town chiefs, etc., cannot remain silent in the face of this tragedy. We hereby jointly and urgently request that you allocate more funds or food to the county to provide emergency relief and save the dying people from falling into ditches. We await your urgent orders." Hong Tongbai, Town Chief of the North-East Town of Jiande County, Wu Zhongyu, Town Chief of the North-West Town of Jiande County, Cheng Jian, Deputy Town Chief of the South-East Town of Jiande County, Dai Dupei, Town Chief of the South-West Town of Jiande County, Bi Ziliang, Town Chief of Huangpu Town, respectfully knock.</p>
<p>Thank You Telegram</p>
<p>To Mr. Du Yuesheng and Mr. Jin Tingsun of Shanghai:</p>
<p>"After the severe drought in our county, followed by frost damage, the disaster situation is the most severe in Zhejiang Province. The suffering is widespread and the people are waiting to be fed. We are grateful for your concern and compassion, and for your generous donation of 2,000 yuan to benefit the disaster victims. Your great kindness is deeply appreciated. On behalf of all the disaster victims in the county, we respectfully express our gratitude." Ma Chengji, Chairman of the Jiande County Relief Branch, respectfully knocks.</p>
<p>Union Protests Case of Western Employee of Jardine Matheson Forcing Chinese Worker to Death</p>
<p>Yang Hu Issues Statement</p>
<p>Regarding the case of Niumen, a Western ticket inspector on the Jardine Matheson's Longhe ship, forcing Chinese seaman Tong Tianhou to death, the China Seamen's Union has collected evidence and formally lodged a protest. According to Yang Hu, director of the union, the deceased, Tong Tianhou, was a seaman in the middle cabin of the Xianghe ship. Due to missing his ship, he boarded the Longhe ship. Lacking funds to purchase a ticket mid-journey, he was beaten by ticket inspector Niumen, fell into the water, and died. It has now been verified and there is an autopsy report from the Wuhu Local Court to prove it. No one wants to die. If he had not been humiliated too much and beaten, Tong Tianhou would not have died. This is very clear and needs no further explanation. Tong boarded the Longhe ship for the Shanghai-Nanjing section and paid 1 yuan and 1 dime for a half ticket. Since he had the right to purchase a half ticket, his origin should have been known by the ship's staff. Knowing that he was a seaman who had missed his ship and lacked funds to continue purchasing a ticket, Niumen used violence after departing from Nanjing, determined to kill him. This behavior is disrespectful to our nation and a deliberate insult and murder. Missing the ship and lacking funds is a minor matter. Even if a ticket needed to be purchased, it could have been reported to the company, and the company could have sought compensation from the union. Even if he were an ordinary passenger who lacked funds to purchase a ticket, he should not have been beaten to death. Moreover, he was a seaman of the same company. This matter violates both the law and human decency. I (Yang) am responsible for leading the seamen and will seek justice to uphold humanity. We have lodged a strong protest with Jardine Matheson, and the company should provide compensation and punish the perpetrator. The nature of this case is serious and should be of concern to the whole country. We must seek practical measures to protect Chinese seamen and prevent such tragedies from happening again. I respect the company's history and hope they will understand this, not cover it up, and accept our demands sincerely so that this case can be resolved peacefully without escalation.</p>
<p>Municipal Government Collects Disaster Relief Donations from Five Bureaus</p>
<p>Totaling Over 590 Yuan</p>
<p>Delivered to Emergency Relief Society Yesterday for Distribution</p>
<p>Wu Tiecheng, Mayor of this city, previously collected donations from the bureaus under his jurisdiction. Yesterday, he delivered the donations to the Renji Hall Emergency Relief Society on Yunnan Road, stating, "We received your letter forwarding the donation register for emergency relief for the Yellow River flood, requesting fundraising, which was distributed to various bureaus for fundraising. The Public Works Bureau, Education Bureau, Public Security Bureau, Health Bureau, and Public Utilities Bureau have submitted donation registers and donations to the Municipal Government. The Public Utilities Bureau reported that the donations from its staff, totaling 26 yuan and 5 dimes, have been directly delivered to the City Bank for collection, and receipts have been issued. The donation registers and donations from the Land Bureau, Finance Bureau, and Tax Bureau will be collected and delivered separately. We are delivering the donations from the other bureaus, totaling 596 yuan and 2 dimes, and 14 donation registers. Please check and issue receipts, and return them to the Municipal Government for distribution." It is heard that the association has long since ended and all unfinished matters are handled by the Xinwei Relief Society. Therefore, the above-mentioned funds have been transferred to the Xinwei Relief Society for distribution.</p>
<p>Gu Xianglin Sentenced for Extortion</p>
<p>Fine of 30 Yuan</p>
<p>Han Tao Tao, also known as Tao Tao, a local resident who was previously a local security officer and is now the director of the real estate department of the Backer and Backer Law Firm on Zhu Bao San Road, is 45 years old and lives at No. 312 Avenue Foch in the French Concession. On May 20th of the 22nd year [of the Republic], at 5:00 PM, when Han left his house and walked out the door, Gu Xianglin, who lived nearby, suddenly pulled out a pistol and threatened Han, saying he wanted to take his life. Han screamed for help and fled to the northwest alley. Gu also fled. Han reported to the French Police, who sent detectives to arrest Gu. Gu had already moved his family and disappeared without a trace. It was only recently that detectives Qian Yumin and Bao Tan Yin Baoke learned that Gu lived at No. 10 Wenyuan Fang, Mintini Road, so they rushed there on the 25th of this month, arrested Gu, and brought him to the Second Special District Court for prosecution. According to Gu's confession, he had pawned a three-and-a-half-point piece of land with Han for 700 yuan. Later, he prepared the money to redeem it, but Han went back on his word and swallowed the money, claiming that the land had been sold and refusing to release it. Therefore, he often went to discuss redeeming the land and denied threatening with a gun. He was instructed to investigate further at a later date. The situation has been reported in the newspapers. Yesterday, Judge Wang Gangxu continued the trial in the Criminal Court 1. The defendant maintained his previous confession. Then, Xu Bingsheng, who was with Han at the time, came to court and testified that he saw the defendant holding a pistol and threatening Han. At this point, Gu was speechless. The court verified the confession and sentenced Gu Xianglin to a fine of 30 yuan, with 2 yuan equivalent to one day of imprisonment. The number of days of detention before the judgment was confirmed was equivalent to 2 yuan per day of fine.</p>
<p>Robbery Case on Wusong Road Sentenced</p>
<p>On the 19th of this month, at 10:30 AM, the home of Ningbo native Lu Linbao at No. 43, Lane 21, Wusong Road, was robbed by robbers under the pretext of delivering gifts. The maid, Pan Chen, was alert and took the opportunity to go out and shout for help in the adjacent neighborhood. Detectives Zhang Guisheng and Zhang Faxiang and Chinese constables No. 298 and No. 201 arrived and arrested Zhu Rongsheng and Zhou Liansheng from Pudong. They found a pistol and six bullets.

The details of the interrogation have been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, they were sent to Criminal Court 3. L厉志山, a lawyer from the Public Works Department, stated that no other cases had been found during the adjournment. It was requested that the investigation be pursued. Judge Xiao Xiefen questioned each defendant to confirm the facts and sentenced Zhu Rongsheng,</p>

<p>National Labor Exhibition General Review Report (1)</p>
<p>The General Review Report of the 23rd National Vocational School and Elementary and Middle School Manual Arts Exhibition states:</p>
<p>For the purpose of improving national vocational education and manual arts education, the Ministry of Education specially held the National Vocational School and Elementary and Middle School Manual Arts Exhibition in the 23rd year. First, schools in various regions selected excellent products and held preliminary exhibitions in various provinces and cities. Then, the best were selected and sent to the Ministry for display and exhibition at the Mingzhi Building of the Examination Yuan. It lasted twelve days, starting from December 1st, and was visited by more than 100,000 people.</p>
<p>The evaluation of this achievement was undertaken by education experts and vocational school experts in various subjects and experienced teachers of manual arts in elementary and middle schools hired by the Ministry of Education. First, a general observation was made, and a comprehensive critique was given. Then, a classified and provincial review and evaluation were conducted, outlining the strengths and weaknesses, as a guideline for improving vocational education and manual arts education in the future. The general situation of the products from each province and city and the opinions of various experts on the manual arts of vocational schools and elementary and middle schools are compiled as follows:</p>
<p>1. Overview of Products</p>
<p>The provinces and cities participating in this exhibition include Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hubei, Hunan, Sichuan, Fujian, Yunnan, Guangdong, Guangxi, Shaanxi, Shanxi, Henan, Hebei, Shandong, Gansu, Ningxia, Suiyuan, Qinghai, and Chahar provinces, as well as the four northeastern provinces, and the districts of Nanjing, Shanghai, Beiping, Qingdao, and Weihaiwei. The types of participating schools include 169 vocational schools, 337 middle schools, 139 normal schools, and 868 elementary schools, totaling 1513 schools. Generally speaking, in terms of the number of participating schools from each province and city, Shandong, Shanxi, and Hebei provinces have the most, all with more than 100 schools. Next are Jiangsu, Chahar, Anhui, Zhejiang, Hunan, and Beiping, all with more than 70 schools. Then come Guangxi, Jiangxi, Shaanxi, Shanghai, Nanjing, and Qingdao, all with more than 50 schools. The fewest are Guangdong and Sichuan provinces and the Weihaiwei district, all with less than 20 schools. The types of products include metalwork, woodwork, bamboo work, stonework, clay work, wax work, bone work, paper work, cotton piling work, pith paper work, plaster work, carving work, lacquerware, pottery, embroidery, sewing, dyeing and weaving, knitting, rattan work, bamboo weaving, rush work, knotting work, wicker work, wheat stalk work, grass drawing, model machinery, scientific instruments, animal specimens, plant specimens, mineral specimens, physiological specimens, agricultural specimens, chemical technology, immersion specimens, natural teaching aids, hygiene teaching aids, geography teaching aids, physical education teaching aids, manual arts teaching aids, photographs, printed materials, art, work sequences, and charts, totaling 43 categories. Among them, woodwork is the most numerous, with more than 3,000 pieces. Metalwork and work sequences and charts both have more than 2,000 pieces. Sewing, embroidery, knitting, bamboo work, and chemical technology all have more than 1,500 pieces. Clay work, paper work, and plant specimens all have more than 1,000 pieces. Dyeing and weaving, rattan work, scientific instruments, animal specimens, and printed materials all have more than 500 pieces. The fewest are bone work and hygiene teaching aids, both with less than 10 pieces.</p>
<p>2. General Review of Achievements</p>
<p>A. Advantages</p>
<p>1. It is not easy to achieve such considerable results shortly after the implementation of the manual arts curriculum standards for elementary and middle schools.</p>
<p>2. The products of middle schools and normal schools in many provinces and cities can utilize manual arts to create scientific models and teaching aids, which are not only related to science teaching but also provide practical applications, with special educational value.</p>
<p>3. The products of vocational schools in various provinces and cities are mostly practical and not much different from actual commodities.</p>
<p>4. Schools in many provinces and cities can utilize local unique products to make useful items, which have considerable production value.</p>
<p>5. The products of elementary schools in many provinces and cities can utilize manual arts teaching materials to create various toys related to national defense, arousing children's interest in national defense. This shows that elementary education can pay attention to national rejuvenation.</p>
<p>B. Disadvantages</p>
<p>1. Some schools still fail to thoroughly understand the meaning of manual arts teaching and production education.</p>
<p>2. The products of schools in many provinces and cities are monotonous, lacking both creative spirit and educational value, and are mostly impractical.</p>
<p>3. The number of products from normal schools is excessive, and the products submitted fail to fully express the special training spirit of manual arts teachers.</p>
<p>4. The number of agricultural and farm affairs achievements is too small, and the products of rural elementary schools, except for Shandong and Qingdao, are rarely seen.</p>
<p>5. Schools pay little attention to the investigation of local production industries.</p>
<p>6. Many products from various schools do not seem to be the usual achievements of students but were specially made for this exhibition.</p>
<p>7. The achievements of home economics are mostly focused on luxury goods and fail to meet practical life needs.</p>
<p>3. Evaluation of Vocational School Achievements</p>
<p>A. Agricultural Subject Achievements</p>
<p>1. Those with creative ideas, such as the waterwheel of Gu Gengfu of Jiangsu Provincial Huaiyin Normal School, which uses centrifugal force to draw water, are quite ingenious and should continue their efforts to achieve completion.</p>
<p>2. Those with systematic approaches, such as the complete set of silk exhibits displayed by Zhejiang Provincial Advanced Sericulture Vocational School and the wax-preserved fruit and pest specimens of Suzhou Agricultural School, are organized products with educational reference value.</p>
<p>3. Those who advocate value, such as the imitation iron plows and cultivators of Shanxi Private Mingxian School, the threshing machine of Shanghai China Vocational School, and the lightweight incubator of Jiangxi Provincial Agricultural and Forestry School, are the most practical and should be promoted and implemented universally.</p>
<p>B. Mechanical Subject Achievements</p>
<p>1. General Review</p>
<p>The promotion of vocational education in our country is still in its early stages, and it is truly astonishing that vocational schools' mechanical subjects can achieve such results. However, compared with the products of countries with advanced machinery, we are still far behind. To avoid falling behind, we should pay attention to the following points:</p>
<p>(1) Schools should earnestly cultivate students' concept of equality in vocational careers and train students to have full faith in their studies and the determination to engage in them for life.</p>
<p>(2) In peacetime, when teaching students to select practical teaching materials, the following points should be noted: (1) those related to mechanical theory, (2) those with basic practice significance, and (3) those relevant to daily application or production.</p>
<p>(3) Inspire students' creativity.</p>
<p>(4) Students' practice does not seek to be continuous but must cultivate a habit of precision.</p>
<p>(5) When trial-manufacturing machinery, the materials suitable for its operation should be configured. Therefore, the general idea of the strength and weakness of materials must be taught.</p>
<p>(6) When trial-manufacturing machinery or tools, the steel used should be given appropriate heat treatment according to the different operations and different uses.</p>
<p>2. Separate Review</p>
<p>The products of agricultural vocational schools are relatively few this time, and can be roughly divided into five categories: 1. Agricultural products (including rice, wheat, cotton, tobacco, beans, loofah, corn, etc.), 2. Agricultural tools (including threshing machines, cultivators, waterwheels, etc.), 3. Pests and diseases (including insect and plant disease specimens, with occasional insecticides attached), 4. Manufactured products (including various canned goods and woven products), 5. Teaching materials (including various animal and plant specimens). The commendable items are selected and reviewed as follows: (To be continued)</p>

<p>Hoped-for Normal School Entrance Examination Results Released</p>
<p>(Tianjin, 30th) The results of the Hebei Normal School Entrance Examination were released on the 30th. Because only two schools, Hebei Women's Normal College and Shangyi Girls' Middle School, participated, the number of people was very small. A total of 7 people from the Women's College passed and 13 failed. Ten people passed the Party Ideology and 3 failed.</p>
<p>The Number of Students Studying in Japan Increases Sharply</p>
<p>Breaks Through 3,000</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Japanese-language Mainichi Shimbun stated that after the Manchurian and Shanghai incidents, the price of silver plummeted, and the number of Chinese students studying in Japan temporarily decreased by half. Later, as the two countries approached, coupled with changes in Sino-Japanese exchange rates and the decline in Japanese gold, it became quite advantageous for Chinese to study in Japan. The number of students studying in Japan has gradually increased again. It was found that the number of students studying in Japan was 1,417 in May of Showa 8 (1933), 2,340 in June of Showa 9 (1934), and has increased dramatically since the beginning of this year, breaking through 3,000. Chinese students must account for the majority of each departing ship. There are 260 students at Tokyo Imperial University, 110 at the Tokyo Institute of Technology, 160 at the Tokyo University of Literature and Science, 110 at higher schools, 30 at the Police Training Institute, 150 at Waseda University, and 170 at Meiji University. Most of them are studying science, engineering, medicine, etc.</p>
<p>County Education Bureau Commends Excellent Schools</p>
<p>The Shanghai County Education Bureau, in accordance with the inspection results of this semester, has given rewards to schools with excellent results, in addition to dismissing and punishing those who have not performed well. For example, Sun Jiafeng, the principal of Xujing Elementary School, was diligent in service and was awarded a reward of 16 yuan. Xue Chuanfu, the principal of Zhenxin Elementary School, was effective in teaching and was also awarded 16 yuan. Xi Zhenya, the principal of Yucai School, worked hard. Chen Fubai, the director of teaching at Minhang Central School, assisted in the school affairs of the central district and was diligent and outstanding. Qiang Shu and Zhang Yaokun were competent in handling affairs, and Gu Zengfu, a teacher at Chenxing School, was enthusiastic about school affairs, and all were commended. Zigang and other schools with excellent results were originally on the list for commendation, but because the number of students enrolled this semester was insufficient, they were not rewarded.</p>
<p>Educational Organizations in This City Discuss Improving Education in the Special District</p>
<p>In order to improve education in the special district, the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau has specially convened the United Association of University Faculty and Staff in this city, the United Association of Middle School Faculty and Staff, the Association for the Advancement of Private Schools in the Public Concession, the Association for the Advancement of Private Schools in the French Concession, the Shanghai Branch of the Chinese Cultural Construction Association, the Shanghai Branch of the China Child Education Society, the China Vocational Education Society, the Shanghai Social Education Society, the China Art Education Society, the Modern Thought Society, and other educational organizations, and decided to hold a meeting on February 1 to discuss the method.

<p>Pirates Rampant, Furen Suffers Another Setback</p>
<p>Result: 58 to 24</p>
<p>Scheduled to Return North Tomorrow</p>
<p>The Furen University basketball team came to Shanghai this time to explore technology with the strong teams in China and the West. After several days of intense fighting, they won two games and lost three, which is considered satisfactory. And invisibly, they have indeed benefited a lot. The team is scheduled to return north by car tomorrow.</p>
<p>Last night's battle with the Pirates was the team's final battle. The Pirates had recently swept away the heroes and won the title of the Western Youth League champion, and their spirit was in full swing. Furen confronted them and expected bad luck rather than good luck. In addition, they had been fighting for several days, and the teachers and students were tired. Therefore, under the battle, the Pirates were able to sway and do whatever they wanted, and the situation became one-sided. As a result, they were defeated by the Pirates by a score of 24 to 58.</p>
<p>After the opening jump ball, the Pirates relied on the tall Lan Yin to command at will. In front, there were two Shi shuttling and throwing, and behind, there was Carlson guarding the response, so the score soared. The athletes from the north tried to deal with it calmly, but they were still under pressure from the strong enemy, and the shells were still frequent, so the cavalry was rampant, and the situation was in a slump. At the end of the first half, the Pirates had 32 points, and Furen had only 6 points.</p>
<p>After changing defenses, the Furen generals decided to retaliate. The battle situation was slightly better than before, but the Pirates' momentum was even more arrogant, so the gains were always less than the losses. After that, the small thieves came on the field and replaced the old thieves. Furen was able to gradually increase, but the prescribed 40 minutes had arrived, and the ruthless gong sounded suddenly. As a result, the Pirates won by a score of 58 to 24. The lineups of both sides are listed on the left:</p>

<p>The Liangjiang A women's basketball team lost to the rowing green team by a score of 17 to 27 in the Western Youth Women's Basketball Tournament last night. From now on, this year's championship will likely change hands. In another Group A game, the American women won over the telephone company, but there was no excellent performance, and the result was 21 to 8. In Group B, Han Bili lost to Yiling by a score of 5 to 14.</p>
<p>Liangjiang Performance Deteriorates</p>
<p>Yesterday's Liangjiang performance was exceptionally poor. The lineup was chaotic, and there was no trace of the wonderful teamwork of the past. On the other hand, the green team became more and more energetic as they fought. Because each member of the team was tall, they had an advantage in snatching and passing. In particular, the defense was tight, so that the Liangjiang players could not penetrate under the enemy basket. Most of the time, only the green-trousered women were seen gathered under the Liangjiang backboard. The situation was so disparate. How could Liangjiang not be defeated? Fortunately, the competition adopts a double round-robin system, and there is still a chance for revenge.</p>
<p>The Green Team Towers Over</p>
<p>After the start of the game, the green team immediately showed an aggressive momentum. After Chen Baixue scored a penalty point, the green team intensified their efforts, and in an instant, it became 5 to 2, and then 11 to 2. In the first quarter, Liangjiang was behind by 5 to 11. In the second quarter, Liangjiang improved slightly, relying on penalty opportunities to catch up to 9 to 14 in the first half. However, they became depressed again after entering the second half. The entire team played in a panic, so it was difficult to save the situation. The green team did whatever they wanted, and in the situation of towering over, they won by a score of 27 to 17.</p>

<p>Oh, my childhood companions... Fragmented, trivial, pieced together in my mind, connected to form a beautiful picture. Now, just a small boat needs to turn past the foot of the green mountain in front to see his hometown—the hometown he longed for in dreams and meditations. His joyful heart throbbed faster and faster, his body trembling with delight. "Boatman, will it take turning past another small mountain ahead to reach my home? It's been so many years since I've been back; I've forgotten everything." He turned to look at the old man rowing the boat after turning the mountain bend. "This is Huangni Duan right here!" the old man casually replied. "What? This is Huangni Duan? Where are the houses and people?" He was so astonished he could barely breathe, stunned by the small plain that unfolded before him. "The houses are burned down, and half the people are killed; the rest have fled to the ports! I don't know what evil spirits have descended these past few years! Such a good place has been plagued." "................" "................" Stepping ashore, it was so quiet that not a single person could be heard speaking: the midday sun was scorching hot, making one feel so tired as to want to fall asleep; cicadas chirped a mournful tune in the trees, interspersed with a cry or two from crows, and the splash of water from a long-necked heron startled in the distance, all clearly registered in his mind; the feeling of sadness was truly as unbearable as a lonely traveler lost on a deserted island! He never imagined that his hometown would appear before him in such a desolate state. He looked around, tears streaming down his face, and murmured, "Mother... home... the fields where the green rice used to grow... neighbors..." He simply couldn't believe this was real, as if he were dreaming: Was this the hometown he had thought of day and night? Was it a place where not even a piece of tile could be found? Who would believe it! Walking, walking, several thatched huts appeared before him at the end of Huangni Duan! An old man dressed as a farmer walked towards him, and he felt as if he had discovered a treasure: "May I ask, old sir, is there a family named Zhong living here? Zhong Yuhou Tang from a few years ago!" "Oh! The Zhong family? They haven't lived here for the past two years. What are you looking for them for!" The old man showed surprise at this sudden visitor, while also feeling interested. "I am the second son of the Zhong family; Jinzhi is my father!" "Are you Jianru? I'm getting senile and can't recognize people anymore!" "You are..." "I'm Fang Laozi! I used to farm your family's land." "Oh! It's Fang Lao! Do you know where my family moved to?" He and your godmother live in Changban Town, sixty li from here. Your grandfather died in the chaos of war two years ago... killed..." Fang Laozi realized he had said the wrong thing, but it was too late to stop himself. Staring blankly at Fang Laozi with tear-filled eyes, his ears rang, his feet faltered, and his body fainted to the ground.</p>

<h3>Amateur Mailbox: Views on Chastity Between Husband and Wife</h3>
<p>Editor: I have a friend, Mr. Wen, who became engaged to a woman last year through a matchmaker. The engagement cost about two to three hundred yuan in gifts and other expenses. However, Mr. Wen recently heard rumors from various sources that the woman, Miss Yi, had been intimate with someone before. He then personally inquired among the woman's relatives, and most of them said that it was indeed the case. He asked the matchmaker to secretly inquire of the woman, but she firmly denied her past behavior. However, Mr. Wen is always suspicious and undecided, not knowing if it is true. At the same time, he attaches great importance to the concept of chastity, believing that if she is a virgin, he will marry her on schedule, otherwise he is unwilling to become a couple. Therefore, the following questions have arisen, and I am entrusted to ask you to answer them. (1) How can one know if this woman is a virgin? Is there a simple method? Can a doctor be asked to examine her? (The woman's father seems to agree.) (2) If after examination, it is confirmed that she is not a virgin, can this engagement be terminated? (3) If the engagement is terminated, can the gifts and other items be recovered from the woman's family? Sincerely, Chen Xingguo Editor's Note: There is no need to delve into past events. Moreover, it is not yet certain whether this woman was unchaste in the past. Mr. Wen should not easily believe rumors and doubt others. Marriage depends entirely on the suitability of temperament and mutual respect and love. If Mr. Wen is satisfied with this woman's current behavior and temperament and there is a possibility of marriage, he should hold the wedding on schedule and not be too suspicious. Otherwise, he can ask the woman's family to terminate the engagement to avoid disputes after marriage. Regarding the issue of chastity for men and women, in this era, it is an obligation that both parties should abide by after marriage. However, it seems unnecessary to pay too much attention to premarital chastity. Moreover, nowadays, women like to be active, and the hymen is often broken due to strenuous exercise. Therefore, it is difficult to determine whether a woman is a virgin based on the rupture of the hymen. Therefore, we believe that the examination of virginity is unnecessary. Even if it is examined and confirmed that she is a virgin, if the two parties are incompatible after marriage, it has nothing to do with the issue of virginity.</p>

<p>Opening Address of Lido Grand Theater By Yun The eighth art of today. Is a necessity for social entertainment. And to increase human wisdom and desires. Silver light shines throughout the universe. Indeed. It is as brilliant as the sun and moon shining in the sky. However, the productions of Europe and the United States combine both the refined and the rough. It is difficult to ensure pure quality inside and out. Thus, those who present them to the world mix the good and the bad. Superior and inferior flow together. Although Shanghai's silver palaces and film theaters are arranged like stars on a chessboard, a theater that seeks to exclusively select superior and successful works to entertain the audience is still lacking. In this, my colleagues and I have humbly made an attempt. We believe that Shanghai is a place where culture and talent from the Far East converge. The means to nurture the body and mind and introduce knowledge should be regarded with utmost importance. In addition, when famous films are publicly screened, whether due to responsibilities or time constraints, there is often a fear of fleeting opportunities. We often lament the impossibility of seeing them. Therefore, we dare to exhaust our efforts and considerations to establish Lido. The construction of Lido is based on the intersection of Guizhou Road and Beijing Road. Roads extend in all directions. Transportation is convenient. The entire building was designed and planned by famous architects. Adopting the latest three-dimensional style. All interior equipment and decorations are created by the minds and eyes of skilled artists. The Western Electric giant real-sound projector, specially purchased from the United States, produces sound and light that is accurate and clear. As for the comfort of the spring seats, the solidity of the sanitary facilities, the handling of hot and cold temperatures, and the service of scientific methods, we strive for excellence and perfect ourselves. In order to satisfy those who come and attract those who hear of us. We have spared no effort to provide convenience and happiness to the audience. We dare not boast about it. My colleagues and I initially wished to build the most perfect theater. Spending only the lowest cost. Enjoying the highest degree of entertainment. So that the silver palace of utmost goodness and beauty in the audience's imagination can be realized in fact. We respectfully create immeasurable happiness for the millions of citizens of Shanghai in terms of sight and sound. To make entertainment life share the new year and start anew. We hope to receive the love and support of people from all walks of life. Not just the diligent students. As the opening is approaching. We respectfully offer our humble sincerity. A glorious darling of the film industry in 1935!</p>
<h3>Sketch of Lido Grand Theater</h3>
<p>Holding rich experience, responding to social needs, and understanding that movies are a necessary entertainment in the city, Lido Grand Theater—like a magnificent palace—has sprung up at the most central location in the city, the corner of Beijing Road and Guizhou Road, after months of operation and countless money and effort. The night of February 3, 24th year, at 9:15 PM, is the day of her birth. She stretches her graceful figure, welcoming everyone's visit and guidance. Indeed, the emergence of Lido Grand Theater is the result of research by many experts and months of planning. Her innate physique is extremely sound and flawless, but we still need to work hard on her acquired education and areas for improvement. Therefore, she is sincerely hoping for your guidance and looking forward to your visit. Here, I sincerely and faithfully introduce her to everyone.</p>
<h3>Magnificent Appearance</h3>
<p>Appearance is a representation of content. Humans are like this, so why not buildings? Lido—this new type of building, majestically rising at the corner of Guizhou Road and Beijing Road, has a three-dimensional form, representing urban civilization. Facing Beijing Road, a semi-circular wall several feet high rises into the sky, with Lido's Chinese and English names inlaid on this lofty wall. At night, looking up from below, it is like seeing the beautiful glow of "丽都" and "Rialto" revealed in the dark sky. The black wall at the bottom is made of marble. I don't know how much time and labor it took to make this ink-like stone shine like a mirror. How impressive is this magnificent and solemn posture!</p>
<h3>Novel Design</h3>
<p>Having a solemn and magnificent appearance, of course, there will be no empty content. Moreover, because the interior of the theater has a closer relationship with the audience, all its equipment is uniquely ingenious and carefully considered. Even the smallest details, from the ceiling to the floor, the arrangement of every flower and grass, and the arrangement of every chair and painting, have been conceived by experts and carefully considered several times before completion. The design of the lighting in the theater follows the latest methods, with reflected light lamps installed. Because lighting is an essential part of a cinema, if the light directly reaches the retina, it will be affected by the alternating brightness and darkness. In severe cases, it will harm the audience's eye health due to non-compliance with the principle. In minor cases, a bad impression will occur whenever the lights go on and off. For the comfort of customers and to increase the softness of the air in the theater, Lido spared no expense in installing reflected light lamps throughout the theater, so that the light comes from within the walls and does not directly stimulate the audience's eyes.</p>
<h3>Seating</h3>
<p>Seating is one of the most important designs in a theater, because the comfort of the seat, the pleasing color, and the appropriate height and width all directly affect the audience's feeling. Therefore, special planning is necessary. There are more than a thousand seats in the theater, all with spring cushions and golden circular steel frames. The lower level is all equipped with golden cushions, while the upper level is apple green, echoing the light green on the walls. Being in it, we will not be able to help but feel the inner pleasure and current beauty. Moreover, the arrangement of each chair and the distance of the dimensions have been carefully tested. No matter which seat you sit in, you can get the same effect and satisfaction for the projection on the screen as you would from any other seat. Even the distance between the cushion and the floor has been considered several times before installation. So when you sit there, you will feel nameless comfort and consolation.</p>
<h3>Cloakroom</h3>
<p>The cinema is a place of entertainment prepared for most people, so the setting up of a cloakroom is indispensable. In Lido, both upstairs and downstairs have extremely gorgeous cloakrooms, exquisitely arranged for the audience to chat and relax. Sitting there, you will feel the soft glow, gorgeous settings, and beautiful pictures for you to enjoy to the fullest, and you will not feel a bit lonely. On both sides of the upstairs cloakroom, there are wide staircases for the audience to go up and down, so that when you come out of the upstairs theater, you will not immediately run downstairs, not even having time to put on your coat. This is also a place where Lido has carefully planned for the audience.</p>
<h3>Sound Equipment</h3>
<p>Today's cinema is, of course, based on talkies. Therefore, the sound equipment has become the focal point of the audience's attention. Lido, of course, will not neglect this issue. What she purchased is the world-famous Western Electric Company's latest giant real sound machine, and the clarity and purity of the sound can really be guaranteed to you. However, Lido, which is dedicated to seeking the welfare of the audience, does not feel satisfied with this. In order to make the sound more perfect and clearer, Lido spared no expense in embedding fireproof soundproofing paperboard on the walls. Of course, with this equipment, the purity of the sound is definitely more guaranteed.</p>
<h3>Lights</h3>
<p>As for the light, she used the latest high-density current lamp. The light is pure and white, like a silver moon, and you won't find any yellowish color.</p>
<h3>Management</h3>
<p>Holding the ideal that "the theater is your theater", Lido's management has painstakingly planned and strived to implement everything that the audience should enjoy, and there is no place that is not thinking about the comfort and enjoyment of the audience. In addition to sound, light, and various satisfactory facilities, the issue of hygiene is also receiving extreme attention, in order to seek perfection, so that the audience will never feel uncomfortable. Like in this cold winter, most of the theaters have heating equipment, but if the management is poor, there will be the discomfort of being too cold or too hot. Too cold, of course, will not satisfy the audience. May I ask, what person would want to sit cold in the theatre for two hours? But too hot is not going to yield good results. So, aside from not being able to be interested in the film, an imbalance of cold and heat also causes physical discomfort. Lido has noticed these situations a long time ago, and has hired specialists to manage the theater's climate deliberately, so the condition of being too cold or too hot can naturally be prevented from happening. Furthermore, the air in the theatre is constantly being changed by the air extractor. Dirty air is extracted, and at the same time fresh air is released into the theatre, making the air clean at all times.</p>
<h3>Perfect Management</h3>
<p>No matter what kind of undertaking it is, the success, or making patrons satisfied, is completely in the hands of the manager. So, if the method of management is not good, no matter how stable the undertaking is, it cannot escape collapse. Other undertakings are still like this, not to mention the cinema with its large number of customers? All the management and reception staff in the theater have direct contact with the audience. The audience are the guests of the theater. To receive the guests, of course, you must have a humble and amiable attitude. The manager of Lido Grand Theater has many years of cinema experience, and is certain to make the audience satisfied with the management methods. Whether it is upstairs or downstairs, and the staff, all have received considerable education and have undergone long-term training. Their treatment and reception of the audience are all humble and courteous, so no matter what the situation, there will never be any rude things happening. This can be proven in the future.</p>
<h3>No Intermission</h3>
<p>When the film is being shown, cinemas usually have the habit of stopping for an intermission, but the intermission in the film makes it impossible for the audience's spirits to be consistent. Therefore, under the latest scientific management methods, this unnecessary intermission is naturally eliminated.</p>
<h3>Chinese Subtitles</h3>
<p>Lido, which is dedicated to the convenience of the audience, and to the perfection of the audience, spares no sacrifice to specially hire specialized personnel to translate the explanations and dialogue in the film, and project them with slides. Because, of course, many Chinese people understand foreign languages completely, but there are still many who do not understand them clearly. Therefore, in order for the audience to deeply enjoy everything in the film, special slide subtitles have been added. These Chinese subtitles occupy little space, and the projection on the screen does not have the slightest impact, using scientific methods. This is another deep meaning of Lido in seeking perfection for the audience.</p>
<h3>Low Ticket Prices</h3>
<p>Finally, what I want to tell everyone is that the low ticket prices sold by Lido will really surprise you. For the price of forty cents, in addition to seeing the most valuable famous films, what you enjoy is how luxurious, beautiful, and comfortable. She--Lido, has been scheduled to meet everyone on February 3; facts are the most eloquent, let us look forward to the facts guaranteeing it!</p>
<h3>Lido Fragments By Qin</h3>
<p>Lido Grand Theater will add morning shows every day from the Lunar New Year's Day to the 5th at 10:30 AM. In order for citizens to have a place to spend their time in the morning.</p>
<p>Lido Grand Theater's first film is "Viva Villa!", which is a typical epic revolutionary film full of impassioned emotion. The theater uses this film to open at the beginning of the year, probably implying that the plan for the year lies in spring, and that the revolutionary spirit should be stimulated in the spring, and that the day should be spent in striving and being promising.</p>
<p>Lido Grand Theater pays special attention to student audiences. It will conduct extensive publicity in the academic community. The theater has clear sound and low seat prices, making it the most suitable place for students to study spoken English.</p>
<p>It is heard that Lido intends to facilitate the general audience, and has specially hired experts with many years of experience to translate and compile the Chinese subtitles in the film. They are exceptionally concise and clear. The projection machine is newly ordered from abroad. The projected light is clean and does not hinder the light on the screen. And two specialists are responsible for the projection and proofreading. It is necessary to make the projection timely and correct. To increase the audience's understanding and interest in the film.</p>
<p>Lido Theater does not peddle soda and ice cream in the venue, eliminating the drawbacks of disturbing the audience's tranquility, which is indeed worthy of emulation in the theater industry.</p>
<p>Lido's second film is said to have been confirmed as "Hollywood Party." The third film is said to be "Tarzan and His Mate."</p>
<h3>The Lido's Film Selection By Quan</h3>
<p>--Their Slogan is "Satisfaction for Everyone"</p>
<p>No one can deny that theaters are by no means simply satisfied by the superiority of the three elements of "sound", "light" and "seats", as well as the suitability and grandeur of the building's layout to meet our endless desires. Of course, bodily pleasure is what we seek, and spiritual appreciation is also what we hope for. Therefore, screening good films is a must for a perfect theater to be strictly selected outside of the physical.</p>
<p>Lido selects films with full experience and strict eyes. They will impartially contribute works of substantial excellence. They are determined to satisfy the audience. They will create a situation, that films screened at Lido must be a select work. They will use facts to make the audience confirm that Lido is the "Dragon Gate" of the highest evaluation of films, and once it is performed at Lido, its "value will be ten times higher". They will hold on to this goal, so that the audience will not have a single disappointment, nor the slightest doubt!</p>
<h3>Laurel and Hardy By Yunmen</h3>
<p>Participate in the Nude Movement</p>
<p>MGM's second round at Lido Grand Theater is "Hollywood Party". This Hollywood event has invited almost all the comedic stars in the silver kingdom. The first of these is the old partner Laurel and Hardy (one fat and one thin, most liked by Chinese people). Large-nosed Jimmy Durante, hot girl Polly Moran, and long-faced woman Polly Moran. Even the cartoon character "Mickey Mouse" will also be on stage to perform his skills, not wanting to fall behind. May I ask, just looking at these comedic names is enough to make you laugh until you can't breathe.</p>
<p>There are dramas in dramas, with novelty and ingenuity, and the whole film is woven with songs and dances, which is colorful and difficult to describe in words. What's more, Laurel and Hardy, the two together, are naked and carefree when sightseeing in the nude country. As for the enthusiasm and tension, there is also a "Great Tarzan" big-nosed hero Jimmy Durante.</p>

<h3>"Viva Villa!" Opened a Precedent for International Cooperation By Jie</h3>
<p>This is probably the first time for the American film industry. When MGM was shooting "Viva Villa!" in Mexico, Mexico directly cooperated with the company to help them complete the historical epic. Before the film was decided and not yet started, MGM's authorities felt that without the direct assistance of the Mexican government, it would not be successful. So they started diplomatic procedures with the Mexican government. At first, the Mexican government felt hesitant, but in the end, because Pancho Villa, the protagonist in the play, was a Mexican national hero, and the inclusion of his deeds in</p>
<h3>Captured Bandit Chief Fang Zhimin Alive</h3>
<p>Pseudo Tenth Army Commander Liu Chouxi Also Captured</p>
<p>Pseudo Security Bureau Chief Zhou Qun Discusses Reasons for Bandit Defeat</p>
<p>Hangzhou Dispatch: Fang Zhimin, the bandit chief who had been rampaging for many years in the border areas of Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, and Fujian provinces, was besieged by the bandit suppression troops under the command of Yu Jishi, concurrently the director of the Zhejiang Security Office and commander of the Security Column. Fang's bandit forces were exhausted, and he led the remaining bandits to hide in Mount Huaiyu. The pursuing bandit suppression troops surrounded and suppressed them from all sides, searching separately. Fang's bandits were trapped in the mountains, suffering from hunger and cold. He led only four bandits and desperately descended the mountain to escape. At 7:30 AM on the 29th, he was captured alive by the pursuing bandit suppression troops between Chenjiawan and Nuanshui in the vicinity. In the vicinity of the mountain, important bandit army leaders, including Li Shubin, director of the political department of the pseudo 19th Division, Tan Boqing, minister of health, and twelve others, were captured. More than forty light and heavy machine guns, two large wireless telegraph machines, more than thirty horses, and many other military supplies were seized. After Yu Jishi personally interrogated them, Zhao Guantao, the commander of the four-province border region garrison, dispatched personnel at 6:00 PM that afternoon to escort the two bandits, Fang Zhimin and Liu Chouxi, to the four-province garrison headquarters in Shangrao for interrogation. The Seventh and Tenth Army Corps under Fang's command were completely annihilated, and more than 800 bandits were captured. On the 30th, they were escorted to Hangzhou in three batches from Changshan. Yu was scheduled to return to the province by night train on the 30th.</p>
<p>Information from the Security Office: The Provincial Security Office received a phone call from Changshan on the 29th from Director Yu Jishi stating that Liu Chouxi, the pseudo tenth army commander of the Red Bandit Fang Zhimin's gang, was also captured on the 29th in the Chengjiawan area east of Nuanshui in Mount Huaiyu. Fang Zhimin currently has only five people and is hiding in Mount Huaiyu. Troops have been dispatched to search, and capture will not be difficult. It has been investigated that Fang's Red Bandit gang calls itself the</p>
<p>Southeast Military Commission, with Fang Zhimin, Liu Chouxi, Xun Weizhou, Luo Shaohua, etc. as members, and Fang concurrently as chairman. Their troops are externally called the Northern Expedition Anti-Japanese Vanguard, and they are organized into the Seventh and Tenth Army Corps, divided into the 19th, 20th, and 21st Divisions. Except for Xun Weizhou, the pseudo seventh army commander and concurrently the 19th division commander, and Wang Yizhi, the 20th division commander, who had been killed in battle successively, Wang Ruchu, the new seventh army commander and concurrently the 19th division commander, and Hu Tiantao, the 31st division commander, have been captured and escorted to Shangrao. Luo Shaohua (concurrently the pseudo director of the political department) was seriously injured and died. Now that Liu, the bandit, has also been captured, this Red Bandit gang can be said to be completely resolved.</p>
<p>According to information from the Security Case Office, Yu Jishi, the director of the Zhejiang Provincial Security Office and commander of the Zhejiang Security Column, this time supervised the two brigades of Wu Shi and Wang Li, and the security regiment of this province, and completely succeeded in suppressing the Red Bandit Fang Zhimin and Liu Chouxi's gang in the area of southern Anhui and eastern Jiangxi. The Red Bandits who had harassed the border area of Zhejiang, Jiangxi, and Anhui for five or six years have been completely resolved. Yu, believing that the military affairs of bandit suppression can be temporarily concluded, returned to Changshan from the front line port area on the 26th and went to the column command headquarters to work. Yu also personally brought back more than a thousand captured bandits, including Zhou Qun, the pseudo security bureau chief, Wang Ruchu, the pseudo tenth army commander and concurrently the 19th division commander, Hu Tiantao, the pseudo 20th division commander, Cao Zhihuai, the pseudo army political department organization section chief, Qiao Tianming, the pseudo 20th division chief of staff, one pseudo regimental commander, nine company commanders, and seven political instructors. All were properly settled by the command headquarters, and Yin Zhenhuai, the head of the special party department bandit suppression propaganda brigade, was ordered to comfort them. Except for Zhou Qun, the pseudo security bureau chief, who had been escorted to the provincial capital from Changshan the previous day, it is now known that Wang Ruchu, the pseudo tenth army commander and concurrently the 19th division commander, and Cao Zhihuai, the pseudo army political department organization section chief, were also escorted to Shangrao by the Four-Province Border Region Garrison Command of Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Anhui, and Fujian on the 28th.</p>
<p>Zhou Qun, the Red Bandit pseudo security bureau chief, after being captured by the Zhejiang Security Column and escorted to the province, is temporarily detained in the preferential treatment room of the Provincial Security Office, and a captured bandit named Li Maochun has been assigned to serve him. Therefore, his diet and living are quite comfortable. Because the bandit's right leg has been broken and the injury has not healed, the Security Office has specially sent a military doctor from the military medical section to treat him. According to Zhou's words to the interviewer, he first stated that he was from Xiangyin County, Hunan, 21 years old, graduated from Pingxiang Ping Mine Higher Primary School, and worked in the coal mine bureau. Later, through the introduction of classmates and friends, he joined the Red Army pseudo Eighth Army He Long's department as a propagandist. His superior officer, seeing his hard work, intended to promote him and transferred him to be a technical secretary. Later, he was transferred to the pseudo Sixth Division as an organization staff member, doing mass organization work. After participating in the Huichang Ganzhou campaign, he was promoted to youth minister, and later served as political commissar and executive minister of the security bureau, etc. Finally, he served as director of the security bureau. The mission of the security bureau was to detect inappropriate remarks and actions of bandit army officers and soldiers, and it had the power to arrest and interrogate, but the power of judgment belonged to the court. The entire Fang Zhimin bandit gang numbered about 7,000 people, calling themselves the Northern Expedition Anti-Japanese Vanguard, and organized the Southeast Military Commission, with Fang Zhimin, Liu Chouxi, Xun Weizhou, Luo Shaohua, etc. as members, and Fang Zhimin as chairman. In reality, there were the Seventh and Tenth Army Corps, with Liu Chouxi as the Tenth Army Corps commander and Xun Weizhou as the Seventh Army Corps commander. After they invaded the Zhejiang border, they were intercepted by the security regiment and various armies,</p>
<p>and suffered more than half of their losses. The Seventh Army Corps was then abolished and reorganized into the Eleventh Army Corps, under which were the 19th, 20th, and 21st Divisions, with Xun Weizhou as the commander-in-chief. The bandit leaders and soldiers were treated equally, without paying salaries. Each person was issued food expenses of one dime and four cents per day, but once out of the Soviet area, they arbitrarily robbed and kidnapped people for ransom, and each person could get several yuan or more per day. The bandit army officers' earnings were even several times higher. As for the expenses of the pseudo-Soviet government, they were all extorted from the people, such as consolation money, etc. There were many names, which cannot be described in detail. The suffering of the people in the bandit area has reached the extreme. This time, they fled to the Zhejiang border because their old nest in eastern Jiangxi was broken, and they planned to frequently move to eastern and western Fujian via Changshan for reorganization. Unexpectedly, the blockade line could not be broken through, and the remaining bandits fled into Mount Huaiyu. The troops suffered heavy casualties, and the two bandits, Fang and Liu, could not escape and were captured. As for the reason for the rapid defeat on the Zhejiang border, the fatal blow was that Xun Weizhou, the pseudo army commander-in-chief, was killed in battle at Tanjiaqiao. After Xun's death, the bandit army lacked a leader, and they fled in separate groups, losing contact. Important bandit leaders were captured one by one. Luo Binghui's gang was the pseudo Ninth Army Corps, which followed Zhu (De) and Mao (Zedong) into Sichuan via western Hunan. This time, Fang's bandits falsely claimed to be Luo's gang, intending to borrow the name to strengthen their momentum. In fact, Luo's gang did not participate in it. After being captured, he was deeply grateful for the preferential treatment given by Commander Yu. Although there were still a grandmother and sister-in-law in his hometown, he had never communicated with them once since joining the Red Army, and their survival was unpredictable. (30th)</p>

<p>Shop Employee Commits Suicide Due to Embezzlement</p>
<p>Xie Xiaoyao, a shop employee of Dongshengyang Tea Shop on Wannianqiao Street outside Xumen, is 35 years old, with a monthly salary of seven and a half yuan, plus sporadic income, totaling about ten yuan a month. However, because he was addicted to gambling, he had some embezzlement. His old mother was still alive in his home in She County, Anhui. Recently, he received a letter from his mother saying that due to years of famine, the family could not make ends meet and urgently needed to remit money home for relief. Therefore, Xie asked the shop for leave a week ago, saying that he was going to Wuxi to collect money from a friend. This morning (30th), Xie was suddenly found to have committed suicide by hanging himself on an electric pole on the city wall of Xumen. In addition to reporting to the local court for an autopsy, the shop has notified Xie's mother by letter.</p>

<p>Defense Corps Squad Leader Commits Suicide by Poisoning</p>
<p>In the Nanqiaotou area, about three miles from Anzhen in the Seventh District (Huaxia City) of the county, there was previously an organization of the Defense Corps, with Chen Dali from Anhui as the squad leader. Later, because it was ordered to be discontinued, Chen temporarily lived in the home of Zhou Dingfu, a local gentleman. Now that the end of the lunar year is approaching, under environmental pressure, he suddenly had a pessimistic thought and secretly took raw opium to commit suicide yesterday. When it was discovered, he was already too deeply poisoned to be rescued and died immediately. The deceased had a suicide note, explaining the reason for the suicide. The original letter is recorded as follows: Mr. Dingfu, I am now in economic difficulty and cannot maintain myself. People must die eventually, but you have treated me very well. I can only repay you in the next life. My death is not a problem for you, etc. The head of the district will come to the city today to report to the court for an autopsy.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou</h3>
<p>Wang Hanlun's Divorce Case Resolved</p>
<p>Wang Hanlun, a veteran movie star, and Wang Jihuan, a famous scholar from western Zhejiang, were divorced. The Zhejiang High Court opened a court session at 2:40 PM yesterday (30th). Wang Hanlun, who works for the Shanghai Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer film company, came to Hangzhou by early express train with a girlfriend. Wu Jihuan also arrived. After Judge Xu Shaopu took the seat, he first summoned Wang Hanlun. Wang wore a green呢皮大衣皮 coat, a dark green French hat, and yellow high heels, with heavy rouge powder. Her attitude was natural. After the interrogation, Wu Jihuan was also questioned. Later, the judge earnestly advised them to reconcile. As a result of joint negotiations by the lawyers of both parties, a settlement condition was established: (1) Both parties agreed to divorce. (2) Wu Jihuan paid Wang Hanlun alimony of one thousand yuan, to be paid in four installments. (3) Wang Hanlun's furniture and woodenware will be jointly handed over by the lawyers of both parties, and they will sign and leave the court.</p>
<h3>Shandong's Industrial and Commercial Circles Alone Prosper Amid Economic Panic</h3>
<p>All Banks Have Surplus in Final Accounts</p>
<p>Flour Companies and Others Earned Great Profits</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: In recent years, economic panic has been prevalent in the world. Our country has been affected by it, and all industries in various places have been in recession. Merchants and civilians have been crying out in pain, which is an unprecedented phenomenon. However, Shandong is relatively good because the local area is peaceful. Although industry and commerce are not as good as in previous years, they are still better than other provinces. The financial and industrial, commercial, and agricultural industries all had surpluses in the annual settlements of the 23rd year. In the banking sector, Minsheng Bank had the largest surplus, which was 230,000 yuan. The second was the Bank of China, with a surplus of 160,000 yuan. The Bank of Communications had a surplus of 100,000 yuan. The Ping City Official Money Bureau had a surplus of 90,000 yuan. The Continental Bank had a surplus of 80,000 yuan. The Donglai Bank had a surplus of 40,000 yuan. The Central Bank had a surplus of 30,000 yuan. The Shanghai Commercial Bank had a surplus of 10,000 yuan. The Zhejiang Industrial Bank had a surplus of 3,000 yuan (newly established). The China Industrial Bank, the Zhonglu Bank, and the Shandong Commercial Bank were all breaking even without large profits or losses. Among other industrial and commercial enterprises, flour mills had the largest surplus. Chengfeng Flour Company had an estimated surplus of four to five hundred thousand yuan, and Huifeng had an estimated surplus of two to three hundred thousand yuan. Among the native product dealers, those who made peanuts had the largest surplus, but there are currently no accurate figures. It is only known that Tongju Changxingshun Fuhangjucheng, etc. were the most profitable. (28th)</p>

<p>Director of the Health Bureau and Others Welcome at the Wharf</p>
<p>The board of directors of the Rockefeller Charitable Foundation, founded by American oil tycoon Rockefeller, recently saw that our country has suffered from disasters year after year and specially sent director Fosdick (RS Fosdeck) together with Gunn (SM Gunn), the foundation's representative in China who had previously returned to China from the United States, to China for inspection.

<h3>Li Shizeng Returns from Europe Yesterday</h3>
<p>Speaks Freely About the International Situation Towards China</p>
<p>Difficult to Predict Whether a War Will Break Out</p>
<p>Mr. Li Shizeng, a member of the Central Committee, went to Europe in August last year for investigation and to handle matters such as promoting Sino-French culture. He has been abroad for nearly half a year. Now that his official duties are completed, he arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning on the French postal ship Qiongxuesha. Li's relatives and friends went to the wharf to welcome him. After landing, Li returned to the World Academic Society on Fokaissen Road to rest. Reporters from various newspapers visited him at his residence. He was told in great detail about his mission to Europe and the world situation. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Mission to Europe　First, Mr. Li said that he has been abroad for nearly half a year. Most of his time was spent in Geneva, Paris, Lyon, and other places. In addition to inspecting cultural institutions such as the Chinese International Library and the Sino-French University, he also contacted various cooperation methods in Sino-French culture. At the same time, he also attended various meetings of international cultural and academic organizations to promote the friendship between China and the international community. In the past, he also went abroad every year for this work. He is also scheduled to go to France as usual in June this year. However, whether he will have time to make the trip at that time is still uncertain.</p>
<p>Current Situation in Europe　As for the current political situation in Europe, according to his observations in Geneva, when Germany and Japan successively withdrew from the League of Nations, the political situation among European countries did once become tense. Later, the Soviet Union successfully joined the League, and the situation eased slightly. The foundation of the League was considerably guaranteed. In particular, the proper handling of the Saar issue increased its credibility considerably. Recently, the United States' attitude towards the League of Nations has also been quite close. Although it has not formally joined, it has provided some considerable assistance to the European peace. As for whether a world war is likely to break out in Europe in the near future, it is difficult to say now. However, when he boarded the ship, it was the most tense time for the Saar issue. Now that the Saar has been peacefully resolved, whether this crisis has been eliminated or is still lurking internally is a matter of attention.</p>
<p>International Situation　In addition, the international situation towards China, except for a few who have special circumstances and harbor aggressive ambitions, the rest all maintain good sympathy for us. The member countries of the League of Nations are also like this. The League of Nations' position on the Sino-Japanese issue and the non-recognition of the puppet Manchukuo remains consistent and conservative, and there has been no change from the past, he said.</p>
<p>Going to Beijing Soon　Mr. Li said that he has been away from the country for a long time, and official and private matters are waiting to be dealt with. Therefore, after a short rest in Shanghai, he will go to Beijing to meet with President Wang of the Executive Yuan, Military Commander Chiang, and Wang Chonghui, a member of the Central Supervisory Committee, who is back to mediate the situation, to report on his observations during his trip to Europe and to explore the general trend of the domestic political situation.</p>
<h3>Jiang Dingwen Went to Beijing Yesterday</h3>
<p>Will Return to Zhuji to Visit His Family</p>
<p>Jiang Dingwen, director of the Pacification Office of Fujian, came to Shanghai from Fujian on the 28th. At 11:00 PM last night, he took the night train to Beijing with Ye Ruyin, Guo Qiang, and Chen Lian, counselors and secretaries of the Pacification Office of Fujian Province, to pay respects to Military Commander Chiang, to ask for instructions on the post-bandit affairs in Fujian Province. He is scheduled to stay in Beijing for three or four days, and then go to Hangzhou and return to Zhuji to visit his family.</p>
<h3>Records of Contemporary Figures</h3>

He will meet with Haas, the technical liaison officer of the League of Nations, to discuss everything. Liu Ruiheng also came to Shanghai on the same train.</p>
<p>Tai Shihui, the chairman of the Jiangxi Provincial Government, came to Shanghai by train from Beijing at 5:00 PM yesterday. At 11:30 PM last night, he arrived at Zhenru Station and went directly to his residence to rest.</p>

<h3>Telephone Bureau Overtime Work During the Final Account Period for Employees</h3>
<p>Improving Communication Between Chinese and Foreign Concessions</p>
<p>Direct Telephone Lines Must Be Laid</p>
<p>The Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Communications, recently for the convenience of settlement of accounts in all circles, has paid special attention to the maintenance of machines and lines and the speed of connection. Xu Xueyu, the director of the bureau, and Yu Bingjian, the chief engineer, have notified the employees of the general and branch bureaus that they must work harder and not delay in order to benefit the public. The reporter of the New Sound Society visited Chief Engineer Yu at the Telephone General Bureau regarding the issue of the still slow communication between the Chinese and foreign concessions and whether it can be improved. According to the reply, two years ago, communication between the Chinese and foreign concessions was handled according to the long-distance communication method. After the user registered, the driver of the exchange in this area would connect to the driver of the exchange on the other side. Only when there were free lines could the users of both parties be connected. Such a roundabout connection was very slow. When the bureau renovated the automatic telephone system the year before last, the bureau and the Shanghai Telephone Company consulted on improvement methods to facilitate the convenience. It was then decided to use the current system, that is, to directly connect the outgoing relay lines of the artificial stations in Nanshi and Zhabei of the bureau to the automatic machines of the concession telephone company. At the same time, the incoming relay lines from the company's artificial stations to the Nanshi and Zhabei districts were directly connected to the automatic machines of the two bureaus, so that the drivers of both parties could be spared the trouble of relaying the connection, and the users in the two districts could enjoy the convenience of calling at any time. Because the telephone traffic was not busy at the time, the users of both parties were happy for a while. However, recently, the statistical telephone traffic of both parties has been more than three or four times higher than before, so the existing equipment has gradually become unable to cope. In addition, the Shanghai Telephone Company has been slow in adding relay lines, so the telephone traffic is even more difficult to flow smoothly. The telephone traffic in the two districts is a problem for both parties, not one party alone can improve it. As for the improvement method, the bureau has long been planning it. It should follow the technological improvement process, and both parties should adopt the automatic connection method and lay direct telephone lines in the shortest possible time to be effective. Otherwise, it will be difficult to solve it.</p>
