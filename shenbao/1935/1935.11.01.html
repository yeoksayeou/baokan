<p>六中全會於今日開慕出席中委據聞幕。超過歷屆全會人數此實一大好現象也按中央執行委員會全體會議依照現行國民黨總章雖每半年須開會一次然今次全會因欲與五全大會連續舉行之故延至今日始得集會距上次全會之召開期相隔十月有餘於此間隔期間黨政設施雖由中常會以及其他中樞機關負執行之責然多數中委則皆散處各地聚首為難以是情意上之疏隔主張上之歧異殆屬難免今者歡叙一堂暢論國事則平日隔閡之處當能溝通不少我人於茲。貢一得之私尙希出席中委一鑒　焉。</p>
<p>中國今日外扼於强鄰之壓境內困於天災人禍之交乘國勢阽危有若累卵救亡圖存端賴國家統一之完成建設事業之急進最近腹地赤禍雖已蕩平然其殘餘勢力猶謀盤踞西北邊遠各省為除國家內顧之憂以求一勞永逸之計究應如何處置此全會所應注意之問題也蔣委員長嘗謂欲求勦匪有效必須政治軍事相輔而進。國內有識之士亦多以解决土地問題為言是皆確　不磨之論今取事方面已吿段落政治方面如何設施實亟宜作統盤之籌劃吾人所望於中央各委者此其一自國難發生以來各方奔走呼號皆以精誠團結為唯一要着然事實方面嫌猜隔閣猶未盡消行動步驟亦未全趨於一致所謂「中國僅屬地理名詞之冷嘲仍未能痛為洗刷。以是而欲集中國力復興民族自難發揮其最大之效力夫國民黨旣負建國之全責於此國家存亡絕續之交尙未能使國民屬望最殷之國家統一事業早日觀成此何怪國民對之有所失望耶今後如何能促進全國軍事行政以及其他種種方面之統一以期建設事業之速效實為當務之急此其二。法治之推行為政治淸明之必要條件至其關鍵。則在有健全之合法的政治機構最近立法院對於憲法草案之修正頗能着重此點想能得大會多數之贊可我人所望者卽此次全會及五全大會審査此草案完竣之後應早設法召開國民大會俾憲政早日觀成國民意志得以疏通且為國民黨建立更廣大之基礎於促進國家全體之統一上當能有極大之裨補此其三歷屆舉行會議往往提案多如牛毛决議案亦為數不少然按諸實際則又未必盡屬可行我人以為提案不必多立論不必高要在能切實施行不致落空故於一案决議之前擯除意氣虛心商討以國家福利為前提實為必不可少之條件此其四</p>
<p>總之今日之國運寄託於國民黨之身而各中委所應負之責任則尤重若黨中賢達皆能一心一德置私利於不顧而唯以國家為重則國難雖極嚴重救亡圖存必尙有可為也</p>

<p>（日內瓦）此間一般輿情以為在戰爭繼續時、不致發生延不實施制裁之問題、英外相霍爾法總理賴伐爾意代表阿洛錫明日皆將抵日內瓦、衆視此點極關重要、蓋覺時局距解决之期或較一般人所想像者為近、三國要人彼此相見、當可造成圓滿結果也、惟英人方面則不若是樂觀、以為以前所有之意見互換、不過為初步性質而已、（三十一日路透電）</p>

<h3>英供給阿軍火　墊欵問題發生困難</h3>
<p>（倫敦）銀行界人士相信、阿國政府為購買軍火起見、將向此間財團方面進行談判、以便獲得墊欵、但聞此項談判進行頗為困難、則以軍火製造商要求於定貨時、先付貨欵百分之二十五、其餘百分之七十五則須於定貨起運前、全部付淸、此外阿國曾向此間銀行界要求放欵二百萬鎊、其担保品則均在阿國境內、例如阿國京城至吉布蒂港鐵路之股票、阿國發行機關之銀貨準備金、阿國礦產讓予權等、在目下嚴重時局之下、此等担保品有等於無、故此間銀行界對於是項放欵、似皆無意辦理云、（三十一日塔斯社電）</p>

<h3>非戰公約發起人　斥意為侵略國　利用戰爭為國策工具　此舉顯破壞對美條約</h3>

<h3>英向意要求　利比亞再撤軍　遭墨索里尼拒絕</h3>
<p>（羅馬）據政界人士觀察、英國現希望意大利將菲洲利比亞駐軍再行撤退一師、此事昨日曾由英國駐意大使國魯蒙與首相墨索里尼談及、惟聞首相因英國尙未調回地中海任何軍艦、故已拒絕此請、又聞首相曾向德魯蒙申說、卽使制裁見諸實施、意國亦仍决心繼續征伐阿國云、（三十日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）據經濟財政通訊社駐羅馬訪員報吿、意相墨索里尼與英國大使德魯蒙爵士、日前會晤時、態度至為堅决、謂不論英國態度如何强毅、意國在菲洲方面軍事行動、將不惜以任何代價繼續進行、决無停止之可能、又據另一消息、謂國聯會若對意國不復採取堅决態度、則關於意阿爭端之解决、可在國聯會範圍以內成立協定云、該訪員又謂、菲洲利此亞境內意國軍隊、僅奉令準備開拔、實則尙未首途返國云、（卅一日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>（倫敦）聞駐羅馬英大使德魯蒙爵士於十月二十九日與意相墨索里尼談話時、其態度殊為嚴肅、爵士重行聲明英國與意並無爭論、英國唯堅决履行其國聯義務云、同時意國各報仍以抨擊英國為務、意政府撤退駐利比亞之兵一師團、英政府固甚歡迎、但謂利比亞意軍之實力、現仍超過其尋常之需要云、倫敦方面今又切實聲明苟非英意兩國間之局勢有普遍之進步、則地中海之英艦隊不能减少、（卅一日路透電）</p>
<h3>英前外相西門　說明英國政策　集體制下保持和平</h3>

<h3>導言</h3>
<p>— 廬于道</p>
<p>中國科學社已達二十歲的年齡，在此二十年掙扎之中，已和社會相接觸的，有研究所，圖書館，各種科學叢書，科學月刋，科學畫報以及各種通俗演講。我們竭盡智力想把科學貢獻給我國社會。近十年來漸漸業已得到社會的贊助和認識，然而我們的報答，仍離不了科學的研究。現在我們想到以前所做各種科學事業，有些太專門，恐怕還不能普及到大衆，所以從今天起和申報合作，發刊科學叢談，申報是國內唯一的歷史最久的大報，他爲文化服務的精神，六十餘年如一日，今天我們貢獻這區區禮物（科學）給讀者，想必是大家所歡迎的罷。</p>
<p>我們認定中國缺乏的是科學。我們認定二十世紀是科學時代，我們更認定要把中國現代化，更離不了科學，然而發展科學斷乎不是少數科學家所能爲力的，所以我們更希望把科學大衆化。卽如這叢談主編的都是科學專家，而所談的却都是普通科學的事實。這叢談裏所講的是科學原理，而談法却又十分通俗易曉。我們分出一部份專門研究的時間，希望這科學智識從少數人的審包裹傳播到大家的頭腦中。我們更盼望讀者們從這些叢談裏能够知道些天空的奇妙，生命的消長，物理的蘊奧，化學的神秘以及一切科學的新鮮玩意兒。漸漸地把生活科學化，更進一步而使我們中國科學化，科學中國化，那末我們方才對得起數十萬愛護申報與中國科學社的讀者。卽此作爲本叢談的開塲白。</p>
<h3>閑話秋星</h3>
<p>— 張鈺哲</p>
<p>閑話揚州一書，未能把全篇都寫成隱惡揚　的文章，便引起了一塲的風波。不過閑話秋星這題目大概可以毫無危險。言談之間，無須畏首畏尾，也是一件很痛快的事情。</p>
<p>陸放翁詩裏有「離離斗柄西南指，爛爛星河今古流」兩句，可以說是恰好替秋夜的星空寫照的。本來秋高氣爽，玉宇無塵，一年四季裏最晴朗的氣候，只有在秋天才可找到。秋夜裏每一抬頭望天，便可看到那一條淡雲薄紗般的銀河，從東北到西南，橫跨在天上。天河星河雲漢銀漢等，都是這銀河的別名。每逢秋日天高氣淸，銀河在天上的部位最顯而易見。遵奉孔夫子六合之外存而不論這一條聖訓的人，不願意去細觀乾象，便以爲銀河只是在秋天才可看見，又替他起了秋河的外號。而不知詩經雲漢篇早有一倬彼雲漢，昭回於天一的說法？已經知道銀河是隨天而轉的了。所以爛爛星河今古流一句，以描寫秋天固然是最恰當。但應用到別的季候上去，也不能說他違反事實。惟獨離離斗柄西南指，是秋夜獨有天象，而不能隨便假借的。北斗七星是北方天穴裏最刺目的個星座，大家想必早巳認識。可是想在秋天上半夜去找他，就不大容易。因爲這時北斗本身，已經落到北方地平之上。只剩了斗柄三星，好像條尾巴似的倒堅起來，恰好向着西南指去。放翁雖然惓懷君國，而身在江湖，過着田夫野老的生活，直到了九十餘歲的高齡，和自然界不斷地有密切的接觸。他詩中引用天象的地方頗多，大抵都能與事實相符。</p>
<p>當秋夜的北斗落到地平，中國南部的人民雖然是暫時看不見北斗。而北方的人民仍然可以看到他的　部是在地平以上。當着我們能够看北斗斗身的時候，我們可在意想中將那和斗柄相距　遠的兩顆星，聯一直綫向上延長。當這綫延長到大約等於那兩星相距的五倍時候，我們　可遇一個比較亮些的星。這星光輝的强弱和北斗十星相彷彿。而他所處的地位可就與衆不同了。你若是有耐性作一兩小時天教的觀察，你可以看到北斗七星以及其他一切的星，都慢慢地繞着這星旋轉。其實這便是論語裏面所謂「為政以德，譬如北辰，居其所而衆星拱乏」的北辰。也就是李　遠運命論中「天動星迴而辰極猶居其所」的辰極。按我國從前天上眾星　垣二十八宿的分區，北極附近的星就呌做紫微垣。在紫微垣裏以官名星的例子是特別的多。剛纔所講的北極星，便被稱爲玉皇大帝。也許有人嫌這名稱所帶的封建色彩，過於濃厚。但是從他那巍然不動坐控全天的地位看來。也可說是名副其實。我們來尋這北極星的時候，是利用北斗裏面的兩顆星做工具。這兩星因此也便可以賜以指極星的佳名。</p>
<p>在北極星的其他一方，和北斗正是遙遙相對的區域裏，有五六顆較爲明亮的星。若將這幾個星順序的聯起來，可以成個英文字母W的形狀。他的上端是向着北極星的。這些星便是所謂仙后星座。他的位置是正當着銀河經過的地方。W形之下有一串四個明亮的星。各星相距雖是很遠，而其問的隔離也頗爲均勻，看過去似乎放風箏的綫上稀疏地點綴着幾盞小電燈。這幾個星就屬於仙女星座。這串星裏那最低的一星其實是個跨黨份子。因爲他和另外處南的三個星成了一個幾乎等邊的正方形，而得着　馬星座四方形的徽號。</p>
<p>秋大的星我們可以看到的是非常多。如果照這樣地一個一個談下去，不但談的人說不完，聽的人也要感覺厭倦了。所以我現在只再談到在閒話秋星篇裏絕不可少的兩個星，其餘都暫按下不提。我們認識道路只要曉得幾條榦綫之後，別的道路，再有人稍爲指點，便不難尋到。認識星宿的情形也何嘗不是如此。聞話秋星當然少不了牛郎織女。金風十　　橋飛渡的傳說，大概是無人不知。而和這故東裏的主人翁曾有一面之緣的人數，恐怕便有限了。我們何妨就　給大家介紹一番。秋夜的銀河是從天空的東北角一直流到西南角。仰看天空正當中一帶銀河兩畔最亮的兩顆星，便無疑地就是我們所尋找的牛郎織女。織女星是在銀河的西北。他和旁的光輝稍弱的五個星構成一個整齊的幾何形狀。這形狀是一個等邊三角形和一個斜方形（或平行四邊形）兩角相連而成的。牛郎是位於銀河的東南岸。在半郎南北變方相距不遠處，各有一星，光輝比牛郎稍遜，好像是牛郎肩挑的祖子。</p>
<p>偶然之間遇着一人，經過介紹之後而曉得這人的姓名，那麼你决不能稱他作你的知交。所以能够舉出星的名字和明瞭眾星的情形，也是截然兩段的事情。我們對於未通名姓的路人，實際上所知道的已是不少，因爲至少也是個圓顱方趾含生負氣之倫，至於天上的星，我們雖能指出這是牛郎，那是織女，而這閃閃發光棋布窮蒼的，到底是個什麼東西，我們仍然是莫名其妙。但是世人造謠的本領却是不小。越是不曉事的，越會杜撰出許多故事來。牛女兩宿每七夕一相逢的傳說，大家必定聽過。劉向孝午圖又有織女下嫁孝子董永一段的事。說是前漢蓋永賣身葬父。織女便嫁給他同到新主人家裏，在十天之內織出千匹絹，將身子贖出來。獎勵孝行雖是善事，如此做來可也未免太使牛郎難堪了，銀河天河星河等名字總離不了河。河與海通，因此就附會上有人八月間垂海渚浮槎，經過一年到一城，看見有人飲牛於河，又見宮中的織婦。最神奇處，便是這人到達天河的時日，人間可以看見各星犯牛宿的現象。我們知道銀河的外國名字是可以直譯作乳路的。望文生義他們當然可以另有一種的附會傳說。你若是進到倫敦國家藝術館，可見一幅大油畫，描摹着一個婦人正爲着嬰兒哺乳。一不當心，穌胸乳峯離開了嬰兒小口，而一股的乳汁，如泉地噴射出來。這幅畫的標題便是銀河的起源。銀河這名字，雖然不免帶幾分的銅臭氣，而把他稱作乳路者，也就未免饞涎欲滴了。</p>
<p>北斗英文呌做Dipper。他的意思便是大匙，和斗的意義是相通的。德國人通常稱北斗作dergossenwagen北齊書載有一段關於高僧一行的故事，說他爲要救一個犯罪的恩人，便使個法術令北斗潛踪，然後上奏元宗，稱「帝車不見，古所無者，如臣曲見，莫若大赦天下』。由此看來，北斗在古時也有帝車的稱謂。豈不是同德文的名字和英國hearlesWagon的名稱，有若合符節之妙嗎。北斗掌人間壽天德神話，大槪是根據着搜神記裏，管　敎趙顔向對奕的南北斗請求，將歲數從十九增到九十那段故事而起的。因爲有三國演義的轉載，收到極大宣傳的效力。所以這段北斗故事是幾乎無人不曉。北斗的希臘名字呌做犬熊星座。那北極星的位置便在他們的小熊星座尾巴的尾端。希臘神話關於這大小能星座的傳說，乃建立於一段蛾眉謠諑的故事上。據說天神之后爲着海上人魚妖嬈異常，心裏懷着醋意，想要將她加害。天神運用法力將海上美人魚一變而成深山的大黑熊。可是她的兒子在打獵時候，當然想不到這黑能便是親母，正彎彎抽矢要一箭射去。天神趕緊把這母子變成天上大小二熊的星座。人倫之變的慘劇無形中便避免去了。但是天神之后豈肯便此甘休，也便派人去追趕。據說北方天空的星，一天到晚如走　燈地，晝夜不息，繞着北極旋轉的原因，便是由於追趕大小一熊而起的現象。</p>
<p>仙女　裏一串的四顆明星，最南一個是個跨黨份子，上文曾經提過，那最北一星其實也屬於另一個英仙星座。和這幾個星座有關的一段神話，也是起於女婦的鬥媚爭妍，與北斗神話的結構有些雷同。據說仙女便是仙后的　珠，自以爲她的美麗，　不是那海上神女所能望其項背。海王聽此　怒，就大肆騷擾。仙后弄得毫無辦法，只好犧牲仙女，把他　在海涯荒島，以息海王之怒。當海怪到島上來懲罰仙女的時候，英仙正降伏了一位魔土，手拿魔頭騎着飛馬經過該處。於是將魔首向海怪一照，使他僵如化石。仙女便遇着救星了。這飛馬和詩人還有一段因緣。據說飛爲的啼踏到地上能使泉水直噴出來。所以他也有使詩人麗藻泉湧文思飈　的效力。</p>
<p>這些傳說，姑妄言之妄聽之，倒也無妨。他雖然未能給我們以星辰的知識，至少可以引起觀看秋星的興趣。至於衆星和我們相距是多少遠，走動的快慢又怎麼樣等等問題的討論，都不免稍爲帶些科學的頭巾氣，和閑話的體裁不合，所以本篇也暫　提起。</p>

<h3>產稻區域　治螟的重要及其實施方法</h3>
<p>— 徐碩俊</p>
<p>今年我國產稻區域螟害普遍，江蘇南部尤重。現當冬季。被害各縣實施治螟，殊屬切要。本文乃自然科學社徐碩俊君在中央廣播無綫電臺之講演稿。徐君曾任浙江省治螟工作有年，現任職中央棉產改進所，研究害蟲，所說極爲精當，足供稻區縣政府實施治螟之參考。</p>
<p>現在雖然是冬季了，螟蟲也銷聲匿跡了，可是過去螟災的慘象，恍然還在眼前，我們不要以爲牠們都死了，實在還在，預備明年爲害。我們要知道。</p>
<p>螟蟲是我們很大的敵人　螟蟲的別名很多，鑽心蟲，漂蟲，白蛸以及水蛆都是的。螟蟲爲害，起初人家不知道，等到白穗一出，就毫無辦法了。江寗縣農民說：「蝗蟲打，結蟲梳，銷心蟲沒藥醫，」所以大家都認爲螟蟲等於人的肺癆，一發作就完了。浙江省民國十八年全省螟災損失二萬萬元，那年米價大漲，農民坐吃大戶：米店遭刦，人心悅惶，地方不寗，浙西一帶，農民談螟色變，不敢種稻，蔣委員畏由前方電浙省政府撥欵一萬二千元，專作冬季治螟之川，可想當時的嚴重了。近兩年螟災又烈，去年江寗一縣損失五百萬元，今年猶未稍减，江寗，鎭江，無錫，吳江，江陰，損失百分之八十到百分之百，江陰縣因滿田白穗，口糧無着，竟有把女兒拋在河內的，（見南京中國日報）其他如崇明，啟東，江浦，句容，常熟，嘉興北部都很厲害。我們知道螟蟲在產稻各區都有，據蔡邦華先生的估計：我們螟災的損失每年至少約有一萬八千餘元，稍烈當達二萬萬元，這眞是令人想不到的數目。螟蟲搶我們的米糧，要把牠當大的敵人看待，絕對不能輕視牠，我們冉看看</p>
<p>螟蟲巧妙的生活　就更知道了。螟蟲在科學上說，有三化螟蟲，二化螟蟲，大螟蟲三種，以三化螟頂厲害，生活情形大致相像，現就三化螟蟲來說：牠一生的變化和蠶兒一樣，由卵化出幼蟲（等於蠶兒，）脫皮五次變　，再過六七日變蛾，蛾又生卯，這就是螟蟲的多一代，如此循環每年發生三代，人至早四十歲纔有孫子，普通要五六十歲，如果結束三代要百幾十年纔行，這長的時間，螟蟲一年就够了，螟蟲子孫發育，適當早，中，晚稻的秧苗以迄成長的時候，所以稻生畏期間，無時無刻不受其害。</p>
<p>再則牠保護周到，一生大部分在耦莖裏生活，天敵如靑娃，蜘蛛，崎蜓都不容易傷害牠。現在稻收穫了，大家以爲螟蟲都死了，其實牠們另有過冬的方法和處所。我們把稻根剝開，裏面有一層蒞繭，牠的幼蟲就躱在裏面過冬因為天氣稍冷，稻也快熟，牠就感到天氣不適宜，食料無着，牠就爬到稻根最後一節作繭蟄伏其中，稻根切口，塞滿了蟲糞，等於人住在長窗緊閉溫和的房中。</p>
<p>這過冬的幼蟲，到了明年陽　四月底五月初的時候牠化蜩變蛾，飛到秧田在秧尖上產下卵塊，每塊有卵子一百粒，每蛾一生可產卵一百四十多粒，繼續三代的卯粒總數當然可驚了。每人生子普通兩三人，生十子者極少，螟蟲繁殖力之大，簡直不能比了。卯塊上有黃褐的毛，蓋着令人想不到是牠的子，江寗縣探到這種卯塊七千餘萬塊，起初農民還絕不相信，這簡直是巧妙的掩眼法。</p>
<p>幼蟲從這種卵塊化出後，吐絲自懸，藉風散播，蛙入稱莖，使秧的心葉枯黃，到了七月第一代蛾出世，八九月間第三化蛾出世，這兩化的卯塊是產，在雖稻　尖五六寸處的葉片上，孵化出來的幼蟲鑽入稻莖中，分不能上升，結果耦發生枯心苗，胎裏死和白穗的毛病，今年江蘇的江寗，崑山，江陰，無錫，武進，吳江，蘇州（靠虎坵）有些稻田，幾乎滿田都是白穗，眞是傷心。</p>
<p>防治螟蟲方法很多，最重要而根本辦法，還是在冬季，來消滅牠。</p>
<p>冬季治螟有效的方法有下面幾種</p>
<p>（一）澈底燒滅稻根　三化螟蟲，全部分在稻根裏過冬，二化螟蟲和大螟蟲大都分在稻根裏過冬，燬滅了稻根，就是燬滅了螟蟲，燬滅稻根方法，就是　把稻田一律耕耙：耕耙以後，一部分稻根覆在土內，一部分稻露出土面。覆在土裏的稻根，其中螟蟲大部分死去，明年不易爲害，我們可以不去管他了；最危險的就是露在外面的稻根，根裏面藏有過冬的螟蟲，我們要全部把牠收集起來，依照下面的方法處理：</p>
<p>（甲）將稻根與河泥層層相　成堆，外而再用河泥好好的封蓋起來，日子長久了，稻根腐敗，可用作肥料。</p>
<p>（乙）將稻根與乾稻眾相混，堆集田中，點火燒燬之。</p>
<p>（丙）掘坑掩埋，以作肥料。</p>
<p>我們今年所受螟災已經够了，我們要减輕明年螟害，我們的稻田都要耕耙，並且要把土的稻根收拾乾凈，千萬不可疏忽。</p>
<p>我們的稻收穫之後，有的種豆，有的種麥，有的種菜，有的種草子，上面所說的方法，在種豆麥和菜類的田，耕翻是不成問題，不過要把露出稻根拾集起來，照上面的方法，處理便可。只是種草子的田，尋常習慣，每有稻未割下即已播種，這種田地的螟虫，能在稻裏安然過冬，最是危險。明年最好先耕土淸燬稻根再種，今年來不及這樣做，草子巳種下，而並未翻土，這種草子田必須從速用鋤頭把稻根全部掘起，依照上面所說的方法處理，方爲合法。又凡不種冬作得田，也要一律　鋤耙平，也要拾燒稻根，總之，絕對不讓有板田及稻根存在。</p>
<p>冬耕燬稱根的好處，除開治螟外，在農業上還有很多好　，冬耕之後，可使土壤受雨雪泳霖的凍消，因漲縮的關係，把土塊破碎，堅實的土壤，可變爲鬆軟，增加稻吸收養分的面積，而且冬耕的田，雨水容易滲入土中，肥料不致流失；竊根的雜草，可以淸除，田中殘根敗業可以趁此翻入土中，腐爛做肥料；而一切的病虫，也因冬耕同歸於盡了。我國有句古話；「田農冬耕，兒要親生，確是不理明言。耕田最好在稻收穫後就耕轉耙平，湖南有句俗話說：「一七金，八銀，九銅，十鐵，」（指陰歷言）換句話說，就是七月耕地，其效如金，十月耕地其效如鐵，愈早耕效果愈大。不過此刻還來得及，不可再遲下去了。</p>
<p>（二）長期灌水　水源方便的地方，若在冬季把稻田灌水淹沒，稻根經過五十日之久，螟虫必全部死亡，明年螟害一定可以大大的减少，因爲螟虫也和人一樣，她在稻根裏蟄伏，也要呼吸，若把水流沒起來，螟虫便要悶死。不過淹水時尙須注意水的深度，一定要把所有稻根的頂端全部沒入水中，否則强頑的螟虫。還不會死的。至於冬季長期液水好處也不少，簡單說來灌水能促進肥料溶解，使堅寶的土壤變爲鬆軟，因水中含有少量淡肥，所以灌水也可以增加田中少量的淡肥。</p>
<p>（三）趕快燒完稻草　二化螟虫的幼虫，天冷有些爬到稻根裏去，但有些盛塞力不敏銳，天冷還在稻莖上部，割稻後就留稻草裏，所以稻草堆裏面躱了不少的二化螟虫。普通稻草堆多在屋側，近秧田的地方，到明年四月底，就爬到稻草堆的外端，化蛹變蛾，飛到秧田產卯。據我們調查：明年六，七月還有存着今年的稻草的，燒稻草愈　而存留稻草愈多的地方，一化螟虫一定很多，所以在冬季要充分利用稻草作柴燒，家畜攔裏　蓐草和飼料，總要在明年淸明以前完全燬掉，至遲也不得過穀雨，因爲那時螟虫還沒有化蛹變蛾，稻草燒，螟虫也燬了。</p>
<p>上面的方面，我們保證是最有效的方法，今年三化螟虫頂厲害，所以要特別注重燬稻根又灌水的方法，在外國祇　吿訴農民就得了，在中國僅僅宣傳，責任還未了，因爲地們沒有組織能力，結果誨者諄諄，聽還是杳杳，一輩子也不會做。所以一定要縣政府運用政治的力量來督促，才能達冬季治螟實施的目的。今年螟災如此之重，江蘇的江寗，鎭江，無錫，吳江，江陰，崇明，啟東，常熟，江浦，以及其他稻區各縣，治螟工作應列爲冬季重要縣政之一。</p>
<p>冬季治螟的實施　要注意下面的幾點：江寗，崑山兩縣政府已如此的實施；特爲介紹：</p>
<p>第一步要組織起來，組織方面應有實施及督察二部：</p>
<p>實施部分　以自治指導區為單位，以自治指導員爲治螟大隊長，警察局長，各中心小學校長分別担任副隊長，依自治組織督促鄉鎭村里長，令農民依照規定方法，實施治螟。</p>
<p>督促部分　每區設督察員一人，率警察一二人至鄉村，督察實施部分是否執行，及是否合法。督察員在冬季治螟期內，應長駐區公所工作。</p>
<p>第二步嚴定實施期限　由縣政府規定一時期，可稱為「冬季治螟工作期」，農民須往此期間，一律依昭規定方法處理完畢，並定一期間爲「冬季治螟淸查期」，如農民因故在第一期未能如法實行者，由督促員淸查，分別處罰，並圖補救。</p>
<p>第一歩要切實普及治螟知識　各區應召集鄕鎭長，村里長，自治委員，分別舉行冬季治螟講習會，並領赴田間實習，各鄉鎭公所亦要定期召集各村里長十紳及大業戶開會，講演治螟方法，同時商討實施辦法；最好還能印發及張貼一點治螟的圖說或淺說（註：該項圖說及淺說，中央農業實騐所或浙江省昆虫局，巳有擬就，函索即寄）。</p>
<p>第四步要厲行獎懲農民能於規定期間，如法辦理者，縣政府要擇尤獎勵，匾額，農具，金錢都可以。農民如在淸查期仍沒依法實行的，即由督察員派警拘罰之，來年並不得報災，及享受縣政府其他救濟的權利。因不依法治螟而受拘束之農民，如鄕鎭長，村里長出具甘結，擔保五日內遵行者，得隨時　出，但處置不宜罰金。我們要深切知道。</p>
<p>冬季治螟很重要　因爲螟虫在普通的時候，都是很活動，卯　　較小，不容易盡淸，現在都集中在稻根裏冬眠，大可一舉而殲滅之。再則治螟等於治病，平常講淸潔衛生，勝過於請好醫生，因爲假使人得了絕症就，是良醫也束手無策，因爲世無起死同生的醫生。稻一旦發生白穗，是無法救治的，即等於絕症，我們一定要未雨繆綢，在冬季就把螟虫殲除，使牠明年無法肆害，與人講衛生一樣。今冬殺了一條螟虫，等於明年殺死了千萬條螟虫，眞是治螟根本的方法。</p>
<p>領導治螟是政府的責任，實施治螟是個個農民的責任。最要緊要通力合作，全體總動員起米，假使不是總動員，有的做，有的不做，那不做的田裏的螟虫，還是可以蔓延到別人的田裏去爲害的，這便是害羣之馬了，大家要裁制他。今年冬季治螟的成績如何，可以預吿明年稻的收成，大家如果希望明年螟害减輕，請不要隨便放過這個好機會。諸位！要切記：「螟害不是天災，是可以用人力防治的。」</p>

<h3>上海防止霍亂</h3>
<p>臨時事務所公吿第三號</p>
<p>（一）自七月二十九日發佈第二號公吿以來已三月於茲、本期公告所以延遲之故、實因本人赴澳洲雪梨出席九月一日至七日之第二屆太平洋國際衛生會議、有以致之、此次得機觀察沿太平洋各處之衛生狀况、甚爲驚異、蓋天花·鼠投·霍亂·等常見之流行病、在中國及印度仍爲極大問題、而在彼處、竟巳絕跡、如於人烟稠密（居民七千萬）之荷屬東印度群島各地、所有天花、霍亂·等疫症、已經荷蘭當局、撲滅殆　、如此成功、實由醫務及非醫務人員與當地領袖及公衆之竭誠合作、方得實現也、</p>
<p>（二）澳大利亞地面廣大、幾與中國相等、但其人口僅六百五十萬、而吾國則有四億五千萬之衆、彼處之死亡率、每千人中僅爲八至九、而於吾國、則為二十至二十五、因該處無重要傳染病、其醫務當局、乃致力於流行感冒與飮食疾病之預防問題焉、</p>
<p>（三）以霍亂而言、民國二十四年、可謂爲最平靜之一年、蓋中國境內無一埠曾發現眞性霍亂也、於上海境內、且曾檢騐疑似患者之　、均經證明爲非眞性、有此良好現象、是否全由於蘇租當局努力推行普及抗疫接種之功效、此時尙難定言、而未曾施行抗霍亂接種之城市、亦幸而獲免、但須注意者、上淋爲散佈之中心、假使本埠無疫發現、則吾人向亦可希望他處不被波及矣、</p>
<p>（四）預防霍亂問題、實甚簡單、其要略如下、甲、須有價應而易得之凈水供給、乙、健康生活狀况、以貧苦階級爲尤要、丙、有系統之普及抗霍亂接種、丁、施行民衆衛生敎育於家庭學校、工廠、及其他相似之團體、戊、開辦設備完善之時疫醫院、隨時能施治療、尤以能施鹽水、汪射爲最要、</p>
<p>（五）爲貧民設置價廉而足用之飲水供給、鄙意以爲實最要之辦法、最近五年、對於此事、雖已多方改善、但自來水之費用、對於最需要之貧民、仍覺高勗、免費給水之舉、固曾於日間定時施行、但分量有限、而急需之者、每不易獲得、應多多設備、使較便利、俾人民易得多量之凈水、如馬來羣島所用之法、甚可仿效、該島之自夾水供給、係由市政府辦理、並於通衢、置有多敎籠頭、免費給水、使貧民除得飲料外、且得沐浴及洗滌之水、今請再舉一例、檳榔嶼北部之葛達地方、昔時爲霍亂猖獗之地、但自二十五年前、設置自來水之後、此疫竟完全絕跡焉、</p>
<p>（六）本人此次曾到爪哇、萬隆、觀察所及、得知對於防治鼠疫有一新法、即用生活而無毒之鼠疫桿菌爲疫苗、以抵抗腺陪斯忒、自本年一月後、已有一百五十萬人、受此種預防接種法、果染患鼠疫者、大形减少、而患者之死亡率、亦爲降低、但此種效果之實現、當地竹舍之防鼠建築、自亦有功焉、仿上述新法、以無毒之生活霍亂弧菌製造較强之疫苗、而試用之、固亦無不可能也、</p>
<p>（七）上海本年度之抗霍亂接種、至九月停止、共接種七六七七二五人、較去歲略多、茲將民國十九年至今之逐年統計列後、以資比較、</p>

<h3>胡文虎　主張組織工商團體</h3>
<p>吳市長表示贊同</p>
<p>中央社云、六屆全運大會、在滬市舉行南洋僑胞領袖胡文虎先生捐資率領馬華選手一百五十餘人、歸國參加、其愛國熱心、至爲欽佩、在全運會期內、胡先生每日爲蒞運動塲參觀各項比賽、並向中央社記者發表國內外同胞應互通生氣、組織工商界有力團體、以促進工商業之發展、指導歸國僑胞、並切實保陣之談話、各界人士械爲注意、記者昨遇吳市長、詢其對於胡文虎先生日前所發表關於組織工商團體之意見如何、承見吿略云、胡先生熱心慈善公益、國人皆知、此次率領僑胞選手百餘人、參加全運會、爲本届全運會增光不少、對於組織工商團體、海內外互通生氣、以促進工商業之發展、指導歸國僑胞，並予以保障、至爲重　、均爲政府與人民間應努力之事云、</p>
<h3>市商會　解釋三種賬單分別</h3>
<p>上海市商會昨爲解釋催索欠欵賬單、核對數月賬單、憑以付欵賬單之區別、函復寗波天勝照相行云、逕復者、本月三十日、接展來函、並附賬單樣張一紙均悉、茲答復如左、（一）印花稅法第十六條第一欵、爲發貨票、第一、欵爲銀錢貨物收據、第三欵爲賬單、各有其獨立之效用、是以應各別貼花、來函所謂發票收據、均已貼花、月底賬單、可不必貼花、則第十六條第三欵、何必另立賬單一項、稅法旣無虛設之條文、尊見自未確當、（二）依據印花稅法、賬單計分三種、其一爲催索欠欵之賬單、其二爲核對數目之賬單、均規定於印花稅法第三條第八欵、其三爲憑以付欵之賬單、規定於印花稅法第十六條第三欵、來函指月底賬單爲即係催欠及對數之賬單、然則究以何種爲印花稅法第十六條第三欵之賬單、故此事應就部訂印花稅法施行細則第五條、以爲三種賬單解釋之標準、其說如下、商家客貨交易、不用現欵、約明大小月底付賬者、其於將屆月底之際、開一詳細賬單、爲月底到期時付欵之根據者、此即印花稅法第十六條第三欵所謂憑以付欵之賬單、蓋約定到期付欵、則客方如果到期將欵付淸、即不得謂之欠、而店舖於月底所開賬單、亦不過係通知性質、令其事前準備、故許多商家、有即名此單爲通知單者、足微其與催索之意義不同、不得謂之催欠、故尊函稱此項賬單爲催欠賬單、實與細則第五條之規定不符、如果該項賬單派去以後、到期欵未付淸、延至下月下節、再行催討、此時自屬催欠性質、目以上屆業有細賬單開去、此後自可祇開一結欠總數、細則第五條、以開明貨品數量價格與否、爲賬單及催欠賬單之區別者、其意義在此、來函指賬單有錯當查四字、謂即係核對數目之賬單、此層亦未確當、蓋月底所開賬單、旣爲客家憑以付欵之準備、詎有付欺而不核對數目者、故此兩種賬單之區別、當問其主要目的、是否在付欵、抑在對賬、如果主要目的在付欵、則查對數目、僅爲付欵時應有之手續、不能抹煞付欵之主目的、而僅認爲對賬所用也、月底賬單、其目的在於令客家準備付欵、並非對賬、故尊函指此爲核對數目之賬單、亦屬錯誤、假使前賬先還若千、而其餘約明年底付淸者、則以後每月每節所開之淸單、註明已還若干、尙欠若干、自可認爲核對數目之用、但尊函所附樣張、並不屬於此一類也云云、</p>

<p>專件</p>
<h3>小學敎員的修養（一）</h3>
<p>— 吳研因</p>
<p>（十月二十五日對全國中等學校學講）</p>
<p>我這次購演的題目是「小學敎員的修養」、聽講的人是中等學校的師範生、師範生還未做小學敎員、好比小姐還未做母親一機、對師範生購「小學敎員的修養」、好比對小姐購「母親的修養」一樣、對小姐講美容術·講跳舞·講戀愛哲學……、小姐也許很歡喜、對小姐講「母親的修養」、小姐也許會不但不歡喜、反而覺得討厭、對師範生講師範生的出路、或者講講海闊天空的敎育哲學、搬些外國敎育家的敎育理論出來、師範生也許會歡喜聽、對師範生講「小學敎員的修養一、眞所謂「夏蟲語冰」、我想師範生也許會不但不歡喜聽、而且反覺得討厭的、</p>
<p>不過、小姐除了一小部份不會生育的人外、將來總得做母親、要做好的母親、總得修養、師範生也是如此、除了一小部分另有所就的以外、總得做小學敎員、要做好的好學敎員、也統得修養、小姐是母親的預備員、師範生是小學敎員的候補人、有心計的小姐、要是想到了由嫁做母親的不易、也許會要總關於「母親的修養」的那一類講演、同樣、有志的師範生、要是有志做一個好的小學敎員、也許會靜心聽我這一次的講演、諸位，要知道小學敎員並不是容易做的、要做一個好的小舉敎員、更不容易、我們不必空空地設小學敎員所負的使命如何重大、我們只消從小地方說些瑣碎的問題、便覺得做小學教員、做好的小學敎員、着實不是一件容易的事了、現在我們分兩方面說、</p>
<p>（一）從師範生的觀點說做師範生的往往不很留心「如何做小學教員」的問題、有時候偶然看見小學裹的種咎、往往以為這是不足為的、例如偶然看見小學教科書的國語課文、會覺得這太簡單組淺了、誰也寫出得來、但是等到　做了小學教員、要他寫些簡單粗淺的課文出來、却就不很容易了、即使勉強寫了出來、會往往不能使兒童領略、用字不確當、文理不通順、眞是左支右絀、毛病百出、要知道師範生所想的、所學的、自以為是的、到了做小學敎員時、往往會覺得全然不是那一回事、單就在師範學校裹所學習的知識技能說、此些師範生自以為所學到的、總可以搬到小學裏去用、後來到了小學裏、才知道從前所學的、有許多是完全用不着的、有許多是遠於實際的、例如國文中的「國故」、算學裏的「高等代數一、理化裏的較高深的部分、甚至敎育科裏的「敎育思潮」、以及各種學說理論、在師範裏裏花上許多工夫、高談闊論的到了小學裏、不是完全用不着、便是離開實際太遠，反過來說、小學裏用得到的種種、在師範裏却往往沒有學過、例如一鑽太取火」的歷史、在師範裏雖然讀過、但是木究竟怎樣鑽、火究竟怎樣取、在小學裏必得實做的、師範生往往沒有做過、又如高深的理化、在師範裏　然學過了、但是到了小學裏、兒童所提出的極粗淺的問題、往往回答不出、我有一位朋友、在師範學校裏做敎員、担任敎學法和小學敎材的研究、有一次、他吿訴我說、他所敎過的一位師範高材生、畢業之後、做小學敎員、拿到了一本敎育部頒布的小學課程標準、有許多地方看不懂、回來問他、請他　給自己聽、我這位朋友於是覺悟自己在師節裏所敎的功課、太理論了太不切於小學的實際了、因此主張就把小學課程標準當做研究敎材敎法的師範敎科用書、其實、我這位明友、是全國數一數二的小學敎育專家、在師範裏擔任功課、也差不多已有了二十五年以上的歷史、他所敎的功課、比較別人、一定切實得多、可是他還覺得不切　、未能把小學裏眞正運用的村　敎給師範生、那末、別的人所敎的別種功課、其不適用於小學、便也可以想見、小　裹用得到的、在師範沒有學過、便也可以顯然證明了、旣然、師範裹學到的、小學裹往往用不着、小學裹要用的、師範裹往往學不到、那末，師範生做了小學敎員、更不得不再學習、便不得不努　修了、（未完）</p>

<h3>小男兒（八一）</h3>
<p>— 美國奧爾珂德女士原著鄭曉滄譯</p>
<p>明天早上她第一句話便是：「我的箱子來了沒有？別人吿訴她今天日裏總會到的，她聽了却還祇是嚕嘈，繼以咆哮，甚至鞭打她的囡囡兒，直使小梅看了爲之展駭。可是她還勉强維持，不過到了五點鐘她忽然不見了，別人想來她或者和韜摩小橋到小山上去了，也不在意，然而到了晚餐的時候，她始終沒有來，別人於是開始問着：「南恩往那兒去了？」</p>
<p>其時小女僕安曼莉正端着一種麥糊糕進來，她就說道：「我看見她獨自一個人拚命沿大路跑去。」</p>
<p>「她已經跑回家去了，這小精怪！」裴夫人喊着，面上現出急迫的神氣。</p>
<p>「也許她往車站看她的行李去了，」拂朗推想道。</p>
<p>「那是不會的，她旣不認得那條路，便是認得了，也不能背着那個箱子走三里路的，」裴夫人說道，開始覺得她的新意想或者是不容易實現的。</p>
<p>「然而這倒又像她的行徑，」裴先生說了立刻拿了他的帽于，要趕出去找尋，忽然立在窗口的解客一聲呌喊，使得人人都忙向門口跑去瞻望。</p>
<p>不錯，那兒來的不是南恩姑娘嗎？身上背着一個重大衣箱，是用一個布袋宕在肩上來的，她看去眞是疲倦，熱透，而且渾身都是灰鏖，可是還鼓着勇氣走來，氣喘喘上了階沿，放下她的重荷，哮了一口氣，似乎說「居然已到目的地了！」便在上面，叉着兩個疲倦的臂膊，說道：</p>
<p>「我實在耐不住再等了，因此自己去拿了來。」</p>
<p>「可是你不認識那條路的囉，」韜摩說道，其時別的人正環立着，覺得這件事眞是好極奇極。</p>

<h3>象徵與文學</h3>
<p>— 許欽文</p>
<p>「文學是苦悶的象徵，」廚川白村曾著專書解釋過，說是所有的文學，產生的根源，都是由於苦悶的；但不是直接的訴苦，是由於象徵的。所以凡是文學作品，總離不了象徵的功用。</p>
<p>不但文學，繪畫也是象徵的；譬如畫一棵松樹，或者楊柳，畫成以后，對照起來，枝葉的數目，總比本體的要少得多，而且葉片同枝條，和枝條同幹子，大小長短的比例，都是很不相稱的；可是一目了然，這是松樹，那是楊柳，看的人總能認識出來，因爲是「神似」的。如果由攝影照成相片，枝葉的數目不會减少，比例的度數也不會差，却不一定相象。原來照樣的縮小，不如神似的能够保眞；所以繪畫是藝術品，照相算不得正式的藝術。</p>
<p>照上所說，可見象徵，是要先把題材簡單化了的，結果是比方着代表着的。</p>
<p>在文學上的象徵，最明顯的是記言；寫在括弧裏面的直接語，形式上好像是照着原有的話一字不差的記下來的，其實不然，這决不是講演錄；只是摘要，把可作爲代表的幾點揭出來寫下就是。</p>
<p>這樣逐部的把題材簡單化起來，使得比方代表着的，只是廣義的象徵。通常文學上的所謂象徵是狹義的，就是素性把題材固有的形態整個的拋開，另行假設一稱事實來比方代表着的。這是因爲題材所固有的情節來得複雜繁碎，如果照實描寫，不但不勝其煩，也是無從入手的。譬如從古到今女性所受的束縛，和被束縛前後的悲喜，統統寫出，事實上簡直是不可能的。須萊納爾的「歡樂的花園，」只有寥寥的幾行，却把重要的情形都表現出來了。又如莫泊三的「項練，」和「野草」中的「風箏，」篇幅都不長，却各寄託了無限的不可挽救的遺恨。</p>
<p>或者，所有喜怒哀樂的情戚，或者高深的理想，原是抽象的；感情就是所謂「無端的，」理想中的情景是「未來的；」要寫成功作品，非先假設一穩能够藉以寄託的事實不可，所謂「具象化，」也就是這一類的象徵。這種作品，大槪是抒情的，不過也可以利用作爲探肘各種問題的工具。</p>
<p>廣義的象徵手叚，在文學作品，非應用不可；採用狹義的象徵手段是由于不得已，因爲非此不足以表現。無論是廣義的或者狹義的，都得相機利用，却不可以過分多用。象徵的色彩太濃厚以后，或者用得不適當，都會陷于神秘，讀者不容易了解，就難以收到效果了。</p>
<p>在文學史上，還有着「象徵派」的名稱；那些自成一派的作家，不但故意多用狹義的象徵的手段，以象徵爲能事，弄得神妙莫測；而且，因爲不滿意于當時的環境，却沒有積極奮鬥的勇氣，沒有努力改造的决心，只是好爲空想，慣于虛構幻境，是「逃避的，」非「現實的，」雖然寫得很美麗，總是不足取的了。</p>
<h3>石盤</h3>
<p>— 陳子展</p>
<p>孔子：今天走得太累了，疲倦得很。我是向來不肯認老的，今朝倒覺得我也快要老了。子路，你可覺得走累了麼？</p>
<p>子路：夫子，我不覺得累，祇覺得今朝天氣太熱。這樣大太陽的天，夫子爲什麼不打傘呢？子貢不是買了一把新傘嗎？</p>
<p>孔子：子路，那個像你，什麼責重東西都肯借，便是用破了也不在乎呢。子貢是個會打算盤的，東西看得頂要緊。下雨的天，我都不肯開口向他借傘，何况今朝是晴天呢！</p>
<p>子路：夫子曉得今朝是要上山的，爲什麼手杖也不拿一根？有一根手杖在手，上山下嶺不也方便些麼？</p>
<p>孔子：手杖嗎？不要說起。昨天我打原壤那個老頭兒的腿子，連手杖也打斷了。</p>
<p>子路：夫子常常說我好勇使氣，粗蠻無禮，慣於動拳動腿的，您爲什麼也要動手打人呢？</p>
<p>孔子：子路，我懶得和你多說。你要知道，正因爲那個老頭兒無禮，看不上眼，我纔敲他脚脛的。我現在口渴得很，你可下山去我點淸水來喝喝罷。你須快去快來，不要會着玩要，我在這裏等着哩。</p>
<p>子路：噢，快來的，快來的。我也口渴哩。</p>
<p>孔子：這孩子慣好招惹是非的，我倒不放心，走去瞧瞧罷。</p>
<p>子路：嚇！哨大餅，喝白水，睡午覺，這是我們夫子每天的老功課。今朝他却要游山了。喝完了開水，又要喝冷水只看他水哉水哉！這個地方有不有淸潔的水呢？呃，前面不是一個水池嗎？對了，對了。</p>
<p>（路灣跳出一隻老虎。）</p>
<p>呸！呸，胚……看咱老子打死你，畜生，畜生！你逃到那兒去？</p>
<p>（趕上前去，捫着虎的尾巴，給他捫斷了。）</p>
<p>媽的巴子！你要性命就不要尾巴了嗎？……且慢。這條尾巴怪好玩的。我要把牠藏在懷裏，帶回家裏，倒看夫子曉得不曉得。呵呀，來得太久了，說不定夫子又要駡人的。趕快拿出水瓶舀水回去罷。</p>
<p>孔子：這個孩子怎麼還不回來？說不定他又鬧出什麼亂子的。</p>
<p>子路：夫子，水來了。</p>
<p>孔子：你爲什麼去這麼久呢？累得我等久了。來，快給水我喝。</p>
<p>子路：夫子，對不起！剛纔我在路上忽然想到一僩問題。</p>
<p>孔子：什麼問題呢？</p>
<p>子路……</p>
<p>孔子：你說呀！儘管說呀！什麼問題你都可以說的。你不要因爲在老師面前就不肯說。你儘管說來好啦。</p>
<p>子路：夫子，上等人殺虎如之何？</p>
<p>孔子：上等人殺虎夯虎嘴。</p>
<p>子路：中等人殺虎如之何？</p>
<p>孔子：中等人殺虎抓虎耳。</p>
<p>子路：下等人殺虎如之何？</p>
<p>孔子：下等人殺虎捫虎尾。</p>
<p>子路……</p>
<p>（子路目瞪口呆，不知所云。孔子正在喝水，佯作不見）。</p>
<p>孔子：子路，前面風景，想必更佳。你可先走一步，看那里有沒有山路可通。我喝完了水，休息一會，就會來的。</p>
<p>子路：噢，夫子，我去了。—奇怪，奇怪！夫子怎麼會知道這回事呢？他早知道水邊有虎，爲什麼又要我去我水呢？明知山有虎，偏叫虎邊行，這不是明明白白要把我餵老虎麼？豈有此理，你這沒良心的老頭子！你想把我餵老虎，害我不得其死然，你就莫怪我子路粗漢，勇猛無禮了。好，你曉得我懷裏有條虎尾巴，我就把這東西丟掉罷。待我想個法子打死你。呵，有了，有了！這里有個石盤，不知是誰丟下的。好極了！我要把牠藏在懷裏，回頭打死你這個沒良心的老頭子。—可是怎麼下手呢？</p>
<p>孔子：子路，這里上去，有沒有山路好走呢？</p>
<p>子路：（似乎沒有聽見，還在痴立出神。）</p>
<p>孔子：喂！子路，你呆站這里幹嗎？</p>
<p>子路：（回頭）夫子，您來了，正好，我剛剛又想到一個問題。</p>
<p>孔子：你又有什麼問題呢？說來好呀。</p>
<p>子路：夫子，上等人殺人如之何？</p>
<p>孔子：上等人殺人用筆尖。</p>
<p>子路：中等人殺人如之何？</p>
<p>孔子：中等人殺人用語言。</p>
<p>子路：下等人殺人如之何？孔子：下等人殺人用石盤！</p>
<p>子路：石盤嗎？您怎麼知道的？……</p>
<p>（大驚失色，連退幾步。身不自主，石盤從他懷裏滾下來！）</p>
<p>（幕閉）</p>

<h3>三個異邦人</h3>
<p>— 春訊</p>
<p>在東京市內，要找到一塊像這樣廣闊的曠地，是十分艱難的。這是一片蔓生着荒草的曠野，有兩處較高的地方闢成了野球塲。一條長長的土隄，滿身長着茅草和荊棘，躺在這曠原的胸上；隄的盡頭，矗立着兩座高高的山崗，也只有茂草沒有樹木。</p>
<p>在黃昏慢緩地吞沒夕陽的時分，我們，三個流浪在異邦的男女，也拖着沉重的脚步，　躅在這塊寂寥的曠原上。我們踏過埋着石礫的蔓草，沿着陡峭的曲徑，登上這小小的山崗。晚風帶着幾分橫暴的威力，吹亂了她們兩人的短髮，還幾乎要把我這單薄的日本式浴衣，吹零散了離開身體似的。</p>
<p>周圍一片密密的家屋，巳經籠軍着朦朧的暮靄了。在我們右邊的不遠處，一條深陷的省綫鐵道，正和長堤成丁字形，無間地駛騁着喧囂的車列。長堤前頭，是一片水鬥汀築成的櫛比的建築物，形式像鄕間的墳墓，也看不見門戶和燈火。我們疑心這是儲藏砲火演習砲火的地方，因爲晚風時常從那邊替我們送來隱約的槍砲聲響。</p>
<p>再望過去，在那點綴着樹蓋的屋頂的波浪上，巍然地聳立着幾座現代的建築物。　着閃光的霓虹燈，也浮着糢糊的輕露。那是東京小市民的熱鬧區域「新宿」。</p>
<p>曠原上的漫步的遊人，隨着慕色的加深，逐漸的消失了。我脫下「下駄」（木屐），讓她倆當墊于，坐在小徑的旁邊，自己揀對面的革坡坐下了。在天邊暗紫的彩雲裏，我找到一個蒼白的半月。</p>
<p>在這樣的境地，談話是一種累贅呵！然而，活潑的茵終於忍不下愛說話的口：</p>
<p>「咱們老是一聲不響地欵坐着，人家會以爲咱們是來『心中』（情死）的呵！喀嘻！」</p>
<p>茵自己先笑了，其次是我笑了，最後是沉鬱的珊笑了。可是晚風立刻無情地把我們的笑聲播走，使我沒有工夫來吟味這笑聲的眞味。</p>
<p>不曉得什麼時候，天上出現了兩顆閃閃的小星，我們都對牠仰着頭。接着又有幾顆更小的鑽了出來。茵和珊都是近視眼的，儘管我怎樣力說和指示，她們總瞧不見，倒回頭指我撒謊，我憤憤地駡了一聲「瞎子」。</p>
<p>夜色深濃了，「新宿」的霓虹燈越閃越明亮，一團弧形的淡紅光圈，罩在那些建築物的頭上。省綫上的電車，駛過時不斷地在電綫上爆出靑亮的星火。</p>
<p>我摸出一盒蝙蝠牌的香烟來，擦了六根洋火，才算把牠點上了。把空了的烟盒丟在草叢裏，隨口地說：</p>
<p>「再過二十年，我再來這裏檢牠。」</p>
<p>「再過三十年，我們要看一個龍鍾的老頭子，重來這裏檢牠。」</p>
<p>總是沉鬱寡言的珊，這回緊接地把我的話補充了。又是三個笑聲混合在一起。又是沉默。我在珊的黑髮下看倒一對明亮的眼睛，像天上的星兒一樣閃着幽鬱的光芒，只是星兒不像她的那樣迫近我。</p>
<p>我知道珊從祖國帶來了一擔痛苦的回憶，這回憶不斷地在鞭撻着她的脆弱的性格。在孤燈下鞭撻出她眼裏淸苦的淚水，而在夜風中，又鞭撻出她眼裏的這種幽鬱的光芒。</p>
<p>茵也暫時的沉默了。應該是，在懷念那個爲了生活的壓迫，終於不能不隻身地離開她身邊，漂流回混沌險惡的祖國的瀚海的他吧？</p>
<p>半缺的月兒，恢復元氣地在彩雲間馳走。是什麼使命呢？使得她這樣堅决匆忙？</p>
<p>我站起身來，扔掉了烟蒂。呵，剛才後方的一片屋頂的波浪，現在已變成了平靜黝黑的海面，在這上面，零落地點綴着點點的漁燈。</p>
<p>我們又拖着沉重的脚步，走下陟峭的山崗。踏進狹小的巷裏，才發覺各人的脚上都是怪癢癢的，原來是草　裏的什麼蚊蟲，把我們的脚都釘得長滿了小小的疙瘩了。</p>
<h3>債</h3>
<p>— 子岡</p>
<p>人漸漸長大，漸漸在荊棘　生的人生道上多走幾年，便覺得各方面的威脅都在襲來了。</p>
<p>尤其是金錢，它成了這裏面的導火綫，觸燃着一星星，就會延燒開去；把人的笑顏化成愁容，把人的心緊揉着，大胖子也會成爲骷髏的！</p>
<p>曾聽到看到不少終年爲金錢牢鎖的人，自己生在這並不舒眉的環境裏，習慣了一些嘆息哭泣的聲音，而這些聲音的發出，却多半爲了錢，是的，錢！</p>
<p>孩子們對於錢的認識是糢糊的，從母親口袋裏掏出來的錢可以換糖吃，換泥人紙馬玩。……向來不想到錢從那裏來，會天眞地吿訴人家：衣裳爸爸買，襪子媽媽買，當人家問的時候。對於金錢的解釋大約和用一個毽子換小朋友十張烟牌一樣罷。</p>
<p>稍懂事時學會了自命淸高漫駡一切的脾氣，由故事中得到了「富翁總是不好的的一個概念，於是駡富者多吝嗇，咀咒金錢罪惡，好像自己是喝西風長大的一般，更想不到將來自已也會成了衆人漫駡之的的。</p>
<p>這些天眞的孩兒們還不知道自己正是父母用血汗築成的債台哩！把工作所得換成了一家衣食，在不得已時出去吿貨，孩子高起來，作父母的背駝矮下去。受不了兒女重負的不常怨駡着討債鬼的與？</p>
<p>而多少背負着「　債鬼」的名義的孩子却偏偏長大了。</p>
<p>一年來，自己逃却了這名義而吊兒郎當地混在外面，忙着腿忙着手在風雨中度過了還算平安的日子，錢從指縫間來，又從指縫間溜出去，皺着眉的時候總比哈哈笑的時候多，我會在小飯店裏立下摺子，靠着自己的信用白吃十天半個月的飯，指望着「下僩月」，於是飯舖掌櫃也跟着我指望，在這幾大難過的日子裏只好自己苦一點肚皮，苦一點腿子。</p>
<p>病來欺凌人了。</p>
<p>於是想起那在以前是認爲怪寒酸的「窮人生了富貴病一的俗語來。病是那樣頑强，牛性，一個勁兒地和人纏繞不淸，疼痛穿過每個關節，當醫生說起營養不足時我只好苦笑，他不知道我每犬交在藥劑代裏的錢是怎麼換來的。那每天扎進手管裏的液體在我眼前浮起幻像，不是黃水，而是錢，還有那伏在它後面的種種苦難。長期注射把手臂扎得浮腫起來，針眼兒像蜂窩一般。（未完）</p>
<h3>扁豆</h3>
<p>— 羅洪</p>
<p>在我們後園的籬笆上，每到秋天，種的扁豆都開了花；那麼小小的，深紫淡紫的花兒。這些小花兒是叢生在一根根細枝上的，牠們掩映在綠葉中間，雖不華麗，却令人覺得很可愛。我就愛牠的顏色素雅，那麼成串地掛在籬笆上，把恬淡的秋色，更裝點成一個可愛的模樣。那些帶有橢圓形的扁豆，也是深紫淡紫的顏色，一片片掛在上面，比那些小花兒更可愛呢。</p>
<p>記得我六七歲時候，有一次母親在整理櫉箱，我希望得到一點意外的東西似的，站在母親旁邊，不肯離開。後來我在櫥裏發現一隻高大的紙盒兒，硬要母親打開來給我看，裏面是好幾隻各式各樣，顏色美麗的帽子，我隱約還記起有幾隻是自己幼小時候戴過了的。我看見一隻帽子，在前邊有兩瓣東西，像小牛角兒的，向前面聳起；把那帽子在手裏震動一下，那兩瓣結實的彎彎的東西便顫動起來，十分有趣，我當時便問母親，才知道牠呌做扁豆。</p>
<p>「便是我們吃過的，燒得油油的軟軟的扁豆嗎？」我那時好奇地問了。那時候我的小小的心裏，還奇怪着怎麼扁豆會做到帽子上來呢。</p>
<p>直到現在，我每年看見扁豆，便想起我的童年，童年是値得人記念的啊！</p>
<p>可是我每年在扁豆花開了的秋天，便覺得我的安閒時期又到了，我每次計劃着自己應該寫許多文章，看許多書；因爲一個炎熱的夏天，把我身體和精神都磨折得十分痛苦。</p>
<p>我往往走到後園裏，坐在一塊大靑石上，望着碧藍的天空，無邊無際地幻想着，有時候便毫無思慮地融化在這鄕村味的秋色中了。這些時候，我覺得自己的心是像那天鵝絨般的蔚藍天空一樣，溫柔地，純潔地，我幾乎忘却了一切憂患與疾苦。</p>
<p>然後我又看着那些深紫淡小花兒，深紫淡紫的扁豆，掩映在綠葉中間，眞是一們恬淡的秋色啊！我是愛秋色的，我看着牠們在微風中顫動，我便在微風中微笑了。</p>

<p>拉蒙·斐爾南狄斯（L．Fernandes）在他的一篇論文巴爾札克的方法」裏，把小說（Roman）和故事　(Recit）很詳細地區別了，他說:「小說是時間內所發生的諸事象之表現，是為這些事象的發生與發展之條件所支配着的表現；故事是發生和終了的諸事象之表示，這些事象的冉現，是根據叙述和說服的法則，而爲記述者所規定着的。」</p>
<p>更詳細地說，「小說中事象是發生着的，反之，故事中的事象是發生和終了的。故事是在一個過去的周圍上被整頓的，小說不是在動詞的現在中，而是在心理的現在中被整頓的。故事中的事象，脫離時間的作用和現實的塲所，換句話說，是穿上觀念的衣裳。」</p>
<p>這裏應該聲明的是：上面的定義中所說的故事，不可和普通所謂「小說中的故事」混同。雖然實際上小說（Roman）和故事（Recit）並沒有怎樣嚴格的區別，但它們是各有其特微的。故事是一種傳述，是取理過去了的，體騐了的，終了的東西，它是不顧其中的心理的錯粽，不顧萬花撩亂的現實發展之性格的表現的，它所用的方法，是一種一推理的結合法。小說則恰恰相反，它用的是繪　的描寫法，是美學的證明；而故事則用一般的記述法，用論理的證明。</p>
<p>拿幾個例子來說。「紅樓夢」和「水滸傳一中有細膩的心理和性格的描寫，所以是一小說一，反之，「聊齋誌異一和『對神傳」等東西，只是「些Intrigue的演繹，這是「故事一而非「小說」。</p>
<p>藝術是現實之具體的反映，作品的具體的形象越是豐富，越是有現實性的東西，就愈能打動讀者的心靈，發揮藝術之社會的機能。在這一點上，小說較之故事來得優越多多。</p>
<p>事實上，故事的記叙式所帶的缺點的是很嚴重的。我們如果把鮑卞西奧的「十日談」拿來看看，便曉得其中的道理。有的文學史家在非難「十日談」中沒有具體的心理，性格的描寫和表現，但這並不一定是鮑卡西奧的藝術才能的缺如，毋寗是因為他採取了故事的記叙形式的緣故。「天方夜譚」一書，也同樣地可爲我們的例證。</p>
<p>小說中所表現的生活，是生活着的瞬間的生活。他應該表現這生活的紆迥曲折和律動，盡其忠實的能力。因此斐爾南狄期說：「他（小說家）的理知與其說是指導的，不如說是被指導的。」這句話並不是故意地要抹煞作家的世界觀的作用；不，如果我們看看杜期退益夫斯基當時怎樣爲他的作中人物共嘗悲喜的滋味，如果我們看看巴爾札克怎樣地為他的作中人物而神往，便曉得作家的主覜，有時候其實是在「被指導」着的。因爲小說的生命，是直觀。所謂直觀，就是說小說家不是從外部去紀述事象和人物，而是使自己生活在小說的境　裏。</p>
<p>現在在各國流行着偵探小說或戀愛小說，正是故事的最下等的標本，在其中現實的反映少到幾乎沒有，那些東西吸收讀者的根據是和宗敎吸收善男信女一樣的。另外，有許多拙劣的幼稚的作品，也往往流於論理的」故事的訊述。在那裏面的人物，都是木頭戲台上的人偶，並沒有感情的推移，沒有生活的關係。因此，小說是美學的，但故事却是一種曖昧的美學以外的東西。而且小說中的觀念是爲具體的表現而被暗示着，或透明地啟示着；可是故事却反過來，以觀念來决定表現，表現多少是沿着抽象的　念的繞而　行的。</p>
<p>這兩種相反的東西，在有些高明的藝術家，却被巧妙地運用在一起了。據斐爾南狄斯的分析，巴爾札克的作品，就是如此的。斯丹達爾的許冬作品，也均有這　的傾向。斐爾南狄斯說巴爾札克是結合九列的種手法而構成人物的—</p>
<p>（一）確立將人物安置在時間和一定的社會集團中之歷史的身分。</p>
<p>（二）由一般概念出發，而形造人物性格的若干特性的心理演繹法。</p>
<p>（三）不單是人物的容貌，肉體，衣服，還包含他日常的環境和居住的專一的視覺的叙述法。</p>
<p>由於這種方法，斐爾南狄斯說：「巴爾札克的人物，在成爲活生生的個人之前，是被思惟了的觀念。」他還加以一先騐的」形容詞。驟然看來，好像是在說巴爾札克所表現的只是他一己的觀念一樣，但事實上是並不如此的，斐爾南狄斯只在着重說明下面這一點，巴爾札克的作品，並不是「枯燥的寫實主義」的作品，而是有着現實的浪漫的要素存在其中。巴爾札克的綜合的創造典型的能力，正是斐爾南狄斯所說的道理而來的。他說巴爾札克的人物的性格，「是所表現的生活部分自然地决定着的。」</p>
<p>巴爾札克的把故事和小說統一爲一物，也無非是他那宏大的題村的緣故。凡是偉大的作家，總不會單偏於那一方面。比如果戈理的「塔拉斯，布爾巴一是一郁歷史的故事，高爾基的「俄羅斯童話」也是故事，但這兩部作品，却同樣地量高妙的小說；因爲都是故事和小說之統一的產物。這點小小辨議，也許對於我們不無若干的啟示的吧。</p>
<h3>郊外的義塚</h3>
<p>— 大保</p>
<p>一切都荒凉得很，</p>
<p>世界是多麼的冰冷！</p>
<p>這兒，是郊外的義塚，</p>
<p>此地沒有得意的過客，</p>
<p>此地沒有繁華的花草；</p>
<p>只幾棵野生的白楊，</p>
<p>在這些無主的墳前，憑風飄蕩。</p>
<p>藍白色的燈籠，</p>
<p>看去像是這些死鬼的眼睛——</p>
<p>不相識的靈魂呵，</p>
<p>你們可有什麼未曾說盡</p>
<p>留在死後向人世訴寃？</p>
<p>這裏掩埋着幾多孤零的生命？</p>
<p>他們的身世是多麼的可憐！</p>
<p>在萬千的人羣裏，</p>
<p>到頭他們找不到一個可靠的同伴。</p>
<p>或者是飄泊失踪的少年，</p>
<p>或者是江湖的老漢，</p>
<p>或者是啞吧，痴子，或是落後的殘兵……</p>
<p>總之，他們是不幸的一羣。</p>
<p>他們孤獨地生存，</p>
<p>直到死亡的一天；</p>
<p>直到死亡的一天，</p>
<p>給陌生的隣人拉在一起安葬</p>
<p>算是補償他們生前的悽凉。</p>

<h3>商情與電信</h3>
<p>— 楨</p>
<p>自義阿風雲發生以來，國際市塲，已起波動狀態。日本股票市場，八月一日起到九月一日止，此種股票，增價總額，卽達九萬元之巨。尤以九月十八日之東京株式市塲，呈現突進的塲面，主力股票價格，在一日之間，暴漲六七元，突破五十生年間之紀錄。我國國際貿易，以絲茶鑛砂等出口爲鉅。自義阿開戰後，市氣異常俏利，粵產之鑛鑛砂日前每百斤價値祇六元，現已漲至二十元，生絲每兩漲至三角五分以上，比較前月幾漲三分之一，綠茶市價，每箱已漲五元。可知現今商情之起伏，然不與國際經濟政治有關。在此縱橫錯綜情形之下，經營商業者，除必具有商業上之智識外，尤須注意商塲之消息如何也。</p>
<p>所謂商塲消息者，不僅必知　種商品之價格，且須以現在情形，以推測將來之趨勢起也。商品價格之高下，依國際市塲之供求而定，其變動甚速，其利益甚大。然苟昧於時勢，忽於時機，决不能收什一之利，故消息靈通者，實握操奇計贏之樞紐。</p>
<p>欲求消息之靈通，近者莫於利用電話，遠者莫於利用電報，尤莫於利用電話收發電報。蓋電報之功用，在於秘密報吿商情，電話之功用，在於本埠或鄰區談議交易，惟國際消息，瞬息萬變，電報通信，愈速愈妙。故以電話收發電報，無須差役奔走之煩，祇須向當地電報局聲請登記後，在辦事室中，用電話傳遞電報，不數分鐘，消息達到目的地，尤為通信中之捷徑。</p>
<p>軍事家之言曰：「知己知彼，百戰百勝」，又曰：「運籌帷幄之中，决勝千里之外」，又曰：「靜如處女，動如脫兎」，此戰略上之知識也。經營商業，何獨不然？軍事家得各方之情報，而定其進退攻守之方，猶之商業家得各處之消息，而决其出入收放之計。故大商業家之籌謀，不在目前門市之繁榮，而在操縱將來社會之需要，苟不利用電信，以傳達消息，雖有絕好機會，必交臂失之，况在不景氣情况，興競爭激烈之下，維持現狀，亦不可得矣。</p>
<p>我目光遠大之商界人士，在國際風雲之中，必不失此千載一時之機會，必不棄靈通消息之利器！電信而不用。</p>
<h3>國內電報減價之結果</h3>
<p>— 浩</p>
<p>交通部電政司爲明瞭國內電報業務之趨勢，及各項報務之盛衰起見，年有國內電報統計圖表之編製。最近已將二十三年份編製完竣，記者披閱一遍，對於二十三年份國內電報業務情形，略知梗槪，用誌所感，以吿關心電信事業者。</p>
<p>夫凡百事業之發展，在在與政局之安定有關，電信事業亦不能獨異。溯自十七年北伐完成，統一實現之後，社會秩序比較穩定，故工商各業，均有欣欣向榮之槪。不幸自入二十年後，外則遘東省與淞滬之變，內則遭水旱兵匪之厄，災禍遍地，元氣大損，遂使商賈裹足，市面蕭條。國內電報業務，亦聯帶受重大之影響，試觀左列十七年至二十三年份所發國內電報次數字數比較表，便可瞭然：</p>
<p>年別　次數　字數</p>
<p>十七年　三，二六一，九〇五　一三六，五六二，二七七</p>
<p>十八年　三，四五一，八九〇　一四一，八六六，八八四</p>
<p>十九年　三，六〇〇，二〇三　一五五，〇一九，二四四</p>
<p>二十年　三，四四九，三八一　一六二，五一九，七四三</p>
<p>二十一年　三，〇四七，五七四　一四八，〇六三，六〇九</p>
<p>二十二年　三，八六八，二三八　一三三，五三七，四六四</p>
<p>二十三年　三，二七六，八六一　一三五，五九五，九三三</p>
<p>右表所示，可知國內電報業務自十七年至十九年均逐年上升，二十年至二十二年則又逐年下降，凡此均足證明電報業務之盛衰，與時局之安危，在在有密切之關係，而互爲消長者也。然而二十三年間國內情勢並不優於囊昔，而國內電報業務反見增加，其故安在？此蓋由於國內電報價目大量减低所致。查二十三年以前，國內電報之收報人姓名往址均須按字計費，報費過昻，公衆之負祖過重，自二十三年一月一日起，收報人姓名住址在十五字以內槪作五字計費，電報價目於焉大减，公衆對於電報遂多所利用。反之，如果二十三年份國內報費價目仍襲舊例，不予减低；則二十三年份國內報務，勢必較昔更形慘落，可以斷言。再觀乎國內電報自减價後，由二十三年一月至十二月間，尋常電由每月十八萬次增至二十三萬次。此則又由於减價宣傳之逐漸普遍所致，明乎此，則二十三年份國內電報之增加，有非偶然者矣。</p>
<p>再就加急電報言，則業務愈改進，次數愈减少，良以業務改進之後，尋常電速率隨以提高，公衆需要加急電之機會，自必减少。去年一年間，電報業務之改革視往年獨多，而克利特複鑿機，電報打字機，等新式電報機棧之採用，又爲去年間事，在此情形之下，電報速率之提高，實爲必然之事，以理論之，加急電報次數，勢必低减，然而統計所載，則去年一年間加急電報次數總共爲八二，三〇〇次，視二十三年份之八〇，三一七次，反增二〇八三次。夷考其故，實由於加急電三倍收費改爲二倍收費之結果，所謂「從多取利」是也。凡此種種，深足證明電報减價政策之成功，而當局者當時之能毅然實行，確具深遠之目光也。</p>
<p>至二十三年份發報字數，驟視之，在比例上似較往年减少。實期二十三年份字數，均係按照收費字數計算，如將收報人之姓名住址之實在字數計之，則字數將視二十一年二十二年爲多，可無疑義，而出入之間，公衆發電費用之减輕，固不在少數矣！</p>
<h3>傳遞氣象電報之統制</h3>
<p>— 聯</p>
<p>風雨雲霧，變化無常，燥濕陰晴，更易靡定，而航海飛行，以及農事畜牧，在在與天氣有密切關係。故欲求航行之安全，農事之豐收，與夫畜牧之繁盛，必須預知天氣之變化而爲之備，欲預知天氣之變化，尤非彙集各地之測候報告，不能確定未來之天氣，而此項報吿之傳達，更須準確迅速，因是氣象電報之功用尙矣。</p>
<p>氣象電報者，卽傳達各地測候報吿之利器也，傳遞投送，首貴敏捷，故東西各國氣象電報，大都列在公私電報之前遞寄。我國各電局，對於氣象電報，向極重視，祇因年來國內辦理氣象機關，日見增加，旣乏統一制度，又無規定集中地點，致此項電報，日益充斥，往返傳遞，漫無限制，不特電局業務，深受影響，卽氣象電報之效能，亦日漸消失。本年四月間，交通部爲整頓電局業務及統制氣象電報之傳遞起見，特擬定氣象電報分區廣播辦法，提出全國氣象機關聯席會議，當將原則通過，嗣經交通部電政司與中央研究院氣象研究所商定詳細辦法，自七月一日起施行。茲將此項辦法摘要列後：</p>
<p>全國各地，劃分五區，以上海·漢口·天津·長安·廣州五處電報局為各該區內氣象電報之集中地點，各區內之氣象電報，祇能發寄各本區內之區中心電局，各該局按規定時間，依次用無綫電廣播，上下午各一次。至全國氣象，由中央氣象研究所彙集各區中心電局之氣象廣播後，再用無綫電廣播。</p>
<p>前項辦法施行以來，已逾三月，所得效果，可略述如左：</p>
<p>一、電報數量之减少在分區廣播辦法未施行以前，各處氣象電報，往返遞寄，殊多重複，例如：蕪湖海關所發氣象電報，除發致南京中央氣象研究所外，同時並後致山東建設應測候所等處，且一地發寄氣象電報之機關，不止一處，自新辦法施行後，每地祇能有一個機關發寄氣象電報，且祇能發致本區之中心電局，重複之弊，因以祛除。截至本年六月底止，本部核發之氣象電報執照，計有一百五十餘張，自七月一日新辦法施行後，卽减爲七十餘張，每一執照每日以發兩電計算，每日可减少氣象電報一百五十餘通，是氣象電報之數量，已减少百分之五十有奇。</p>
<p>二、收發報地點距離之縮短我國幅員廣袤，氣象電報收發報地點，因素無限制，故其距離，每甚窵遠，傳遞需時，大都不能於有效時間內傳達收報機關。自有統制辦法後，各區內之氣象電報，祇能發寄本區內之中心電局廣播，收發報地點之距離，因以縮短。例如：歸綏以前發寄南京者，現時祇須發至天津，蘭州發寄靑島者，祇須發至長安，蒼梧發寄濟南者，祇須發至廣州，其向由上海·天津·漢口·長安·廣州五處發寄國內其他各處者，祇須送交本地電局廣播，可不經輾轉傳遞之手續，其便捷爲何如耶？</p>
<p>三、工料時間之經濟氣象電報之數量，旣經减少百分之五十以上，工料之减少，自亦有同等之效率。且照新辦法之規定，氣象電報，因綫路機器等發生障碍，致距交發時間在二十四小時以上猶未傳達收報局者，一律停止傳遞。蓋以此項電報，在實際上已失時效，輾轉傳遞，不僅糜費工料，抑且壅塞電路。再就氣象電報傳遞之時間言，因收發報地點距離之縮短，手續之减少，時間亦隨之俱减。例如：蒼梧發寄南京之氣象電報，須歷時數十分鐘或一小時以上，現因改發廣州，數分鐘內，卽可到達，其時間之節减，奚營倍蓰。</p>
<p>四、氣象電報效能之增加　氣象電報之數量，雖減少過半，而因收發報地點距離之縮短，手續時間之節減，其效能反較前增加。蓋因各區內之氣象電報，除少數僻遠地處發出者外，大都均得於觀測後二小時內傳達區中心電局廣播，不失時效。凡需要某地或某區氣象通訊者，祇須備機收聽，同時且可收聽各區中心電局依次廣播之氣象電報。換言之，卽可收得全國氣象報告，較諸以前僅收得一隅或少數地處之氣象報吿者，其效能之增進，誠不可以道里計也。再各電局曩因氣象電報收發之濫，數量之多，未失時效與已失時效者，一例看待，任期延擱。自新辦法施行後，數量旣減，且有規定路由，傳遞時均特別注意，不使稽延，俾可迅速傳達區中心電局，及時廣播，此亦增進氣象通訊效能之一大原因也。</p>
<p>統制氣象電報傳遞之成績，雖如上述，而現行分區廣播辦法，能否行之久遠，尙不可必。因每一區中心電局廣播之時間有限，電報數量之增加，不可漫無限制，各氣象機關請領發電執照時，宜審愼考慮，苟非必要，不宜率請，凡某一區域之鄰近地帶，已有氣象霞報發寄者，卽可不再發電，以免重複。全國各氣象機關，尤應有切實之連絡，通力合作，形成一體，則國內氣象通訊之前途，庶乎有豸。</p>
<h3>交通部頒布審查私立無綫電信傳習所規則之意義</h3>
<p>— 松</p>
<p>短波無綫電報，用於實際通信以來，以其設備簡而效用宏，一般味於國家法令者徒，常私自設立電台，招雇無綫電員工作，推其幣害，小之破壞礦營電信，大之擾亂社會治安，迭經交通部懸賞法辦在案。惟治本之道，在於無綫電人員之訓練，而人員之訓練，在於無綫電學校之監督。交通部本此原則，爰商同敎育部訂定審查私立無綫電信傳習所規則一種，於十月七日公布，茲將內容分述之：</p>
<p>（一）關於訓練方面者：傳習所得分設通信及工程兩班，修業期限，通信班至少十個月，工程班至少十五個月，（以實授課程時間計算）經此相當時期之訓練，必能勝任愉快。入學資格，通信班須具有初中畢業程度，工程班須有高中畢業程度，則入學資格，旣經規定，學生程度，平均提高，濫竽者無能立足也。至傳習所學科，以下列各種爲必修課目：一·電學槪要，二·無綫電學，三·電信法規，四·無綫電工程學，五·電報收發，六·原動機槪要，七·打字，八·無綫電機裝設及修理，九·世界地理及電報綫路，十·翻譯電碼。上項課目，分別爲工程班通信班之主要科。</p>
<p>（二）關於監督方面者：傳習所旣須呈准當地敎育機關立案，又須呈由敎育部核轉交通部審查，及由交通部咨請軍政部備案。凡未經敎育部備案，及交通部審查者，得斟酌情形，咨請敎育部飾令查閉之。又所定修課目之授課時間，及其敎授材料，應呈由敎育部轉咨交通部查核，必要時交通部得派員視察之。學生修業期滿成績，應呈送交通部審查，交通部認爲辦理成績不良者，得咨請敎育部令其改善，或撤銷其立案。似此在敎·交·軍三部監督之下，凡以無綫電信傳習所爲營業者，無所容身矣。</p>
<p>（三）關於學生利益方面者：傳習所旣經嚴加審查，辦理不善者，令其改善，或撤銷或不准其立案，則良莠已辨，涇渭自分，求學者當有所鑑別也。所有應習之學科，均經規定，按時授課，計月完成，關於電信上之知識與技能，必能植其根基，加以自修，當可獲得高尙之職業。故持有交通部，審查合格蹬明書之學生，交通部於舉行報務員機務員考試時，准其應試。換言之，非持有前項證齊者，不准應試，換言之，非入交通部審查合格之無綫電信傳習所，不能獲得相當職業也。</p>
<p>交通部訂定此項審查規則，其意義爲（一）扶植無綫電信敎育，（二）造成無綫電信專門人才，（三）統一無綫電信管理權，（四）防止濫用無綫電通信爲作姦犯科之工具。在此國體當前之時，無綫電通信，與軍事關係甚鉅，尤應加以嚴密注意者也。</p>
<h3>發寄國外華文電報省費要訣</h3>
<p>— 淸華</p>
<p>發往國外的電報，價目要比國內電報貴十幾倍，每字少則六七角，多則三四元，所以發電人必須懂得省費的要訣，才不致多耗電費，合乎經濟。下面是兩個省費的要訣：</p>
<p>（一）發往日本（朝鮮臺灣在內）華文電報的省費辦法　華文電報每字須用四個數碼代替，在國內往來，每字收費一角，較洋文電報每字二角，可省電費一半。但在國際間往來，不論華文洋文價目相同，這顯而易見的吃虧不少。可是遇到緊急要事的時候，又不能不打電報，不懂洋文的人，又不得不打華文電報，這在經濟困難的人，就戚覺到非常痛苦！但是自從上海國際電台與日本東京電台通報後，特別開放一種優待的華文電報，他的計費辦治，有兩特點：（一）收報人姓名住址和收報地名共計只作一字收費。（二）電文按每七個數碼作一字計費。我們試舉一例於下：</p>
<p>東京淸水叮二番李鴻元母病危速歸</p>
<p>上面這個電報，如照普通華文電報拍發，要作十四個字託費（東京二字係收報地名只作一字收費），照現在價目每字七角計算，（以上海發出爲限）該電報費要九一元八角。如將該電電文母病危速歸」五個字的電碼，卽二十個數碼，接連寫在特製的電報紙上，那麼就作三個字計費，因爲照章每七個數碼只作一字計費　其餘東京淸水叮二番李鴻元」，一個字，只作一字計費，所以該電祇按四字計費，只需報費二元八角，一張電報可省去七元之多，不是便宜得可以驚人嗎？這個省費的辦法，我想我們旅日的僑胞和國內的同胞，很少知道的吧！不過這種優待的華文電報，以上海與日本往來，並且須經上海國際電台傳遞者爲限。如向水綫電報收發處拍發，就不能受到這優待的利益了。</p>
<p>（二）發往其他各國華文電報的省費辦法　上面已經說過發往國外的華文電報價目，與洋文電報相同，報費吃虧很多，所以交通部　爲新編一種羅馬字母電碼，便利國外華僑與祖國通訊。這種電碼是以三個字母代表一個漢字。例如BZI一碼，代表「國」字，發電時，將電文內的漢字，完全照交通部刋行的「電碼新編」逐字譯成羅馬字母電碼，例如「貨到欵速匯」五個字，譯成電碼如下：Raoarij　hus　sgiaut，然後將此五個電碼聯接起來成爲Raoarjhussgiavt，再按每五個字母分成一組如下：Raoar　jhuss　giavt這三組密碼，按照國際電報章程，只照三個字計費，而且照普通價目六折計算，所以原來五個漢字，如譯成普通四碼五組，假定每字價目二元，應付報費十元，經改爲三組洋文密碼後，只須付報費三元六角，可以省去百分之六十四的報費，不是也很可驚嗎？</p>
<p>上面所說兩個省費辦法，普通一般人很少知道，所以我特爲提出來，希望海外和國內的同胞能利用這兩個辦法而節省許多金錢！末了，我再得加一句話：就是拍發上面所說的兩種華文電報，要與對方收報人，事先接洽明自，否則對方收到了，一定會莫明其妙，無法翻譯出來。至於讀者如還有不明白的地方，請投函本社，當詳細的奉答。</p>
<h3>英國電報價目減低</h3>
<p>— 記者</p>
<p>英國電報價目，自六月一日起，有顯著之低减。尋常電報其字數不滿九個者，僅收六便士，逾此，每一字加收一便士。</p>
<p>查减價以前，每份電報宇數不過十二個者，收一先令，每多一字加收一便士，此爲一九二零年以來之價目。至歐戰前，因此十二個字之價目，爲六便士，戰時增至九便士云。</p>
<h3>拍發電報的利益</h3>
<p>— 梅卯亨講</p>
<p>諸位：我國大多數的民衆；不知道什麼是電信。我今天特地來舉幾個我曾經聽到的事實來給諸位聽：（一）趙君的朋友，病得很厲害，他想到上海去請一位名醫來給他的朋友醫治，可是因爲他不知道利用竄信，竟自己跑了上海去請，自然一個十分沉重的病人，醫遲了一分鐘一秒鐘，都有很大的關係，所以不等他請到醫生回來，他的朋友已經沒法挽救了。（二）錢君他存了很多的存欵，在上海一家錢莊裏，突然聽到那家錢莊要倒閉的消息，他不去打電報催專欵匯來，後來錢莊倒了，他吃了一筆倒賬。（三）孫君接到了一張朋友的喜帖，一看日期到了，要送賀禮已經來不及，他又想不出什麼辦法去慶賀，竟致失禮了。（四）李君的令郎在外國留學，一天接到他的來信，知道他有病，做父親當然是急得什麼似的，可是要知道他的兒子的病狀眞相怎樣？除了寫快信去詢問外，他還不曉得別種立刻得回信的方法。</p>
<p>諸位想一想，那上邊四個例子存的先生，是多末可憐！加果他們曉得去利用電信，很末（一）趙先生要到上海去請名醫，滿可以發一張加急電報或則打個加急電話去請，何必自己跑到上海去？那末他的朋友，或許因爲醫生早到數小時，還有醫救的希望。（二）錢先生聽到錢莊要倒了，馬上打電報去催他們把欵子匯來，何致於全數損失？（三）孫先生的朋友的婚期已到來不及送禮，可以打封交際電報去道賀，不又經濟又週到嗎？（四）李先生的兒子在外國病了，要知道他的病狀，那是更容易的事情，現在我們交通部的國際無綫電台，和各大國都有直達的通訉電路，如果打一個電報去探問，幾小時內就可以得到復電，免得老是掛念着不放心。其餘因爲沒有去利用電信，因此消息遲滯，坐誤時機，而受無形的損失，還不知多少咧？</p>
<p>關於電信業務常識的介紹，上海申報，有電信特刋每月一日十六日出版，盡量的灌輸介紹，諸位儘可按時讀閱。還有各地電報局，專派業務稽查員，隨時向各界宣傳。交通部仍認爲不足，再令各地電報局，從八月份起，在當地的廣播電台，來作公開的電信業務播音宣傳，使得大家多能了解電信是什麼？怎麼利用電信？不再像我前頭所說的那四位先生的可憐呵！</p>
<h3>新訂國內電報營業通則內容述略（續前）</h3>
<p>— 葆眞</p>
<p>（五）各項特別業務辦法，例好「校對」「分送」等，對於各種電報並不一律適用。新通則內特將不適用各項特別業務辦法之各種電報列為一表（見國內電報營業通則第三十八頁）。發報人可按圖索驥，略一查閱，卽知某種電報，不能適用某項特別業務辦法，頗為簡明也。</p>
<p>（六）關於退還電報報費之條件及手續，新通則內規定頗爲詳細，且較舊章增改甚多。茲擇要略述如左：</p>
<p>（甲）各種電報在尙未發出以前，經發報人請求註銷者，電局應將全部報費如數退還。但電報如已發出而用納費公電追銷者，則不能退費。</p>
<p>（乙）電局如將發報人交發之電報未曾拍到目的地，或收報電局未曾將來電送達收報人，或因傳遞時將發報局名拍發錯誤，以致失去電報效用者，或因電局業務上之過失而將電報延誤者，例如發報人所發電報，自交發起至送達收報人所需時間反較航空郵遞或郵遞所需之時間爲遲者（可通航空郵遞或快遞郵寄之處，以航郵或快郵所需之時間爲準），或因錯誤或遺漏電文，以致全電意義變更或費解者，以及發報人所發電報，如其電文內容經電局認爲有停止傳遞之必要者，電局均應將該電之全部報費照退。</p>
<p>（丙）遺漏或錯誤電文或數字者，或漏註某項特別業務之納費標識者，電局應將遺漏或錯誤各字之報費，或將該項特別業務之附加費（例如抄費校對費）及納費業務標識之一字報費一併退還。但電局如能在上述航郵或郵遞時限內業已自行發覺錯誤而用納費公電糾正者，原電報費槪不退還。惟該項通知更正之納費公電不再向原發報人收費。</p>
<p>（丁）電報因被檢查而致到達遲緩或被刪去一部份電文者，電局不負退還報費之責。</p>
<p>（戊）發報人或收報人對於所發或所收之電報發生疑義時並不照章請求電局代發納費公電，而自行發電直接更正查詢者，無論原電有無錯誤，所有上項更正或查詢電報之報費，均不退還。</p>
<p>（己）預付回報費憑單未經收報人使用或接受者，在三個月內可由發報人聲請退還。又收報人甩憑單抵付回電報費，如有生數在銀元四角以上者，亦可照退。至附有預付回報費之電報，如因錯誤經電局准予退費者，所有預付之回報費一併退還。同時收報人用預付回報費拍發之回電，如因電局業務上之錯誤而失效用者，電局應將預付之回報費連同原電報費一併退還原發報人。前項退費之聲請，應自憑單塡發之日起六個月內爲之，逾期不再受理。</p>
<p>（庚）船舶無綫電報，經海岸無綫電臺通知原發報局不能將電報發往船舶電臺時，該發報局應卽自動將該電之海岸費及船舶費退還發報人，但該電之一部份陸地電臺報費並不退還。（按船舶無綫電報費包括陸地電臺報費海岸費及船舶費，由有關局臺內部自行攤分）。</p>
<p>其他各項退費之聲請，除關於預付回報費應照上述特別規定辦理及船舶無綫電報應由原發報局自動退費外，均須自原電交發之日起，於六個月內行之，逾期不能照辦。</p>
<p>（七）電報報底之保存期間及交關錄送電底辦法，新通則內均有詳細規定。電局對於各種電報之原底及其有關係之文件，自電報交到之下月起算，保存二十個月。電報原底一經交入電局無論必何不得索還。但在上述之保存電底期內，原電之發報人，收報人，或其代表，經證明屬實者，均有要求查閱電底或其抄件之權。每次應納查閱電底四角，但不能將電底或抄伴携出電局門外。在規定之保存　底期內，收發報人或其委託人，得要求電局錄送電底之抄件，或供給電底之相片。其收費價目如下：（甲）錄送電底抄件，每份不逾一百字者，收抄費四角。逾一百字，每加五十字增收二角，不及五十字，亦照五十字計算。（乙）供給需底相片，除按照電局委託照相館所定之價目收取照相費外，每份加收手續費五角。上項辦法對於收發報人不但予以相當便利，且有保障法益之助也。</p>
<p>上述種種僅略述新通則內容之槪要。從此收發報人與電局之間，旣有詳明周密之規章，可資共同遵守，相互之關係，當可益臻密切，亦改進電報業務之一項重要設施也。（完）</p>
<h3>記電報救命事</h3>
<p>— 英</p>
<p>這是一椿災事，在本年九月四日上海各大報的本埠新聞欄內都登載着，現在把牠轉錄在后面：</p>
<p>「太古公司新北京輸，於八月三十日下午五時，由滬駛甬。船出吳淞口，該輪無綫電突接上海海岸電台電報，謂有少婦何戚氏，搭乘該輪圖自殺，請注意等語。該輪船主當飭令茶房向各艙詳爲查詢。在十七號官　果有單身年靑女搭客一名，態度頗爲抑鬱。卽由經管該號房間之茶房王阿元，詢朋果爲何戚氏，當加管護。翌日仍體送回滬，交其家屬領去。聞該少婦年僅念六，餘姚籍，夫屬均在滬經商，以細故為夫呵責，是以負氣輕生云」。</p>
<p>編者按何戚氏之得免枉死，全是船舶電報救了她的命！倘發報人不知利用船舶電報，那末，何戚氏「久與波臣爲伍」了！社會人士，想要知道在船舶上的親友的消息，或在船舶上的人，想要與陸地上的親友通信，利用船舶電報，是一個最妙的法子，上段新聞，不過舉例罷了！</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>救救中學生</h3>
<p>— 夢若</p>
<p>最近有人因爲看到現在中學校的敎習時間過多，有使學生無法應付之勢，故爲愛護靑年起見，便喊出了「救救中學生」的呼聲來，主張應從早改革。我是贊成這意見的，惟我以爲要救今日的中學生，廢除會考，也是刻不容緩的。</p>
<p>會考非全無好處，這我們是承認的，至少它可以督促中學生，注意學習幾種基本課程，但其流弊之大，想爲主倡者始料所不及，蓋自實施會考以來，不知浪費了多少學生的精力。中學生受會考之害的，當不乏人。</p>
<p>先說學校措置的錯誤。各中學校爲爭榮譽計，每不惜採取「加工趕製」的方法，增重學生的功課，迫令學生加緊學習，以資應付。學問這東西，貴在平日的累積，本非一時所能造就。但學校爲會考，也便顧不了一切，只好叫學生趕快補習，算學程度低的補算學，歷史知識淺的補歷史。它們對於學生所缺欠的，唯恐其塡不進，那里想到學生的精力够不夠？在這情勢之下，學校注全力於會考，其餘對學生應有的訓練，便都忽略了。這眞是一種畸形的敎育。</p>
<p>其次學生本人，會考旣是必經的關頭，準備會考，也成爲他們唯一的努力自標。學校要他們補習，他們便不能不補習。本來中學課程的繁重，已使學生叫苦，再增加功課，應付更屬困難。且補習之外，爲要走捷徑，會考指南，又是非讀不可的。這樣，學生用功算是用得勤了，但結果所得到的是什麼？無用的廢物而已。</p>
<p>我也來附和別人喊一聲：「救救中學生！」</p>
<h3>孩子與藥</h3>
<p>— 田舍</p>
<p>帶了滿身疲乏回到寓所，在扶梯頭十五支陰黯的電燈光下，妻幽雲似的坐在矮竹凳上，傾聽着藥爐裏沸滾的聲息，又附和着一些牆偶的蟲鳴，從露台破敗的板門縫裏偷襲進來陣陣季節尾的夜風，妻的前留海被吹得紊亂，靑白的額角上染着一塗木炭灰，襟項問的鈕口散開着，她的辛勞和疲乏比我更深了，我幾乎要跪倒在她面前，說出百千句盡情的威謝話，或者任他如何的責罰我，責罰我不顧家中的事，不顧兒子的病，不顧她日益瘦弱的身子……</p>
<p>可是妻仍是那　溫和地，吿訴我今天去××中醫院給孩子看病的情形，說是受到一些侮辱性的話，她臉上顯然在苦惱中又夾雜了怨色，而對我却隱掩地說着：「那個年輕的郎中按上小玲的脈，說小玲有先天遺傳下的毒，不是父親的，便是母親的，你想他把我們看成怎樣的人？無賴！娼妓！他把沒大錢請名醫的病家看成下流，你道我心中多麼憤</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>怒！可是總巴望孩子經過這種慈善性的祇化兩角錢號金的治療會好起來，我不得不扔下惱怒向他說明；起先是生　，後來吃了鹹鮝便發了滿身的膿瘡。他點點頭，似乎不信任的神氣，其餘的病家都用更苦惱的眼光看看我，又看看小玲，我領了藥幾乎像逃出來。」</p>
<p>我聽了雖也不免快快，可是，我祇有安慰着妻說：「受此醫生的寃屈又有什麼呢，看施診的病者根本就被薄視了的，只要我們自己保持着淸白就算了，何况，在這吃人的世面，卽使是娼妓無賴，亦不見得統是自甘下流的人吧！」</p>
<p>我跑進房，小玲熟睡在行軍牀上，兩頰敷着黃色的藥膏，幾乎連眼睛都將被掩住了，黃色黏膩的汁水流到白嫩的小耳朶邊，又流上綉花的小枕，小鼻孔裏透着粗而急促的氣息，淡紅色的二片薄薄的嘴唇閉合着，灰白的額角，灰白的兩支柔嫩的手臂伸出在被外。他出娘胎就多病，舉凡廣吿上登着的「其效如神」的嬰孩藥劑—（在經濟能力上所買得起的。）都吃過了。唉，無辜的孩子亦得遭受點人世間薄倖的待遇嗎？</p>
<p>當妻用慈和的聲音叫醒了他，把黑色的藥湯送到薄而淡紅的小嘴唇邊的時候，他照例大哭着拒絕這種苦味的沾嚐。妻當然又不免起了惱怒：「小東西你不肯吃嗎，你娘老着臉受了怨氣弄來的，你不吃嗎，病在你身上，我娘不能替代你吃。」可是，可憐的小玲又伸出兩隻小手推着藥碗，哭着。</p>
<p>隔層板壁的前樓那個湖北女人又在吱咕了，他厭惡我兒子的哭聲，她不喜歡我的兒子，她說我兒子病得骯髒，這種冷酷的顏而在我們却是領受慣了的，我壓根兒也不希冀別人的同情。小玲終於哭得疲了，妻叫我抱他在懷裏，用匙兒灌着藥湯，雖然他還是哭，還是伸出小手推却，但藥湯已「咕咕咕…」流進他的喉管。我替他抹着耳朶邊的黃汁水，輕輕地抖着他，說：</p>
<p>「孩子，乖哪，你咽下這口苦水吧，媽疼你，爸也疼你！」</p>
<h3>火葬塲</h3>
<p>— 從龍</p>
<p>六點鐘敲過之後，太陽走乏了牠的悠長的旅程，收歛了熱毒的光輝，帶着倦意懶洋洋地沈到葱蘢的椰林的背後去了。這時，人們大都做完了白天里繁忙汰沉重的工作，吃過了晚飲，洗好了油膩膩蒸發着汗酸臭味的身軀，透換着一口凉爽輕鬆的氣兒，跨出店門，走上街上，海邊，戲院，咖啡店……嬛遊躑去了。於是，街上又熱鬧起來，像午前趕市似的，人擠着人嘴巴張開着，露出黑光光的牙齒，談扯着，笑着。</p>
<p>迷濛的氛氣里隱約地蕩漾着昻麥蘭（銅鼓）的咚咚的聲音，雜着木挪和不知名的土樂聲，有時還夾帶着一片嘈雜的人　浪，遠遠地傅送到人們的耳朶里，這種低沈念促的音響，給人們聽起來，毫不思索地就知道火葬塲上又有人在舉行火葬禮了。</p>
<p>南洋的風俗，（除了不是信仰佛，回兩敎的人而外，）對於死掉的人完全要送到火葬塲上來焚化，他們是沒有舉行土葬的慣的，他們相信死者的驅壳燒化之後，他的乾凈聖潔的靈魂，馬上就會超升到快樂的天堂里去，這正如土葬的人們的所謂：「入士而安」的空玄虛渺同一樣的道理。記得從前居留在暹羅的時侯，偶然有次和朋友走上火葬塲去瞧人們舉行火葬禮，給那兩個裝扮得怕人的靑面獠牙手里拿着偌大的錫叉魔鬼，在死人的身上一下一下恨恨地刺下去，那死者給火一燒就從火里坐將起來，這種可怖的現象，深深地印留在我的腦海里，那時候，我眞給這幕恐怖的印象撩擾得幾夜不能安然的睏覺，以後一嗅到從火葬塲那邊飛送來的那股難聲的臭燻氣味，靑面獠牙這魔鬼就在腦海里活動起來，心驀地里卜卜地跳着。</p>
<p>在遠遠的葱蘢的椰林的葉縫中，聳露出燦爛閃爍紮搭的異常美麗堂皇的尖塔頂，這便是火葬塲了，塔底下裝着待火化的死屍人，像赴廟會似地，穿着得蠻漂亮，不論是旁觀者或是死者的家屬都是一樣，臉上掛着輕微的笑意，一點兒也沒有悒鬱與淚容，舉哀那更是不必說了。</p>
<p>這兒（吧里）的風俗，送上火葬塲焚化的死屍是要包紮成牛形的。爲什麼要紮成生形，人死後怎麼要變成牛？這道理可不知道。遍詢居留在這里歷史最長上了年紀的老年人，也說不出它的究竟來，祇知道這些包紮成牛的死屍，還要依照他的生前的階級，包紮得更成其爲牛形了。</p>
<p>將舉行火葬的時侯，許多人們這死屍　那紮搭的臣尤的　搭、一同　起來，在火葬塲上繞走三大圈，據說這是要逃避那些凶惡的神煞跟在後面。接着，僧人就在死屍上潑起聖水來，然後由家屬和吊祭的賓客獻上祭品，這樣，祭禮就算完了。於是，土樂隊就的的咚咚的急促激越地奏起來，偌大的木頭在死屍的下面畢畢拍拍地吐着熊熊熊的火焰，燒着，燒着。</p>
<p>這時候，圍觀的人們和死者的家屬都急忙忙地離開火塲散開去了，他們恐怕魔鬼會在他們的身上傅播着各種疾病與災難。於是，火葬塲上的空氣就頓時地靜寂下來，祇有那着了火的木頭的畢拍的響聲，劃破了黑夜的靜穆。</p>
<p>這離奇怪異的風俗，和暹羅的火葬禮又成兩樣。</p>
<h3>長畸港夜記</h3>
<p>— 辛爾</p>
<p>船，沿着島國的，盡是靑靑的海濱前進。</p>
<p>「快到長崎了啊」！旅客們都巳在準備登岸了。</p>
<p>無數的，期待着的目光，向着艙窗外起伏的秀巧的靑山；可是，靑山過不盡似的，海濱已近黃香了！旅人們曾一度興奪的胸懷，又漸漸籠罩上灰黯的情調的見見異國的新的容姿的渴望，染透了茫然。</p>
<p>週遭蒙上暗淡暗顏色了。</p>
<p>直到蒼茫的黃昏，和山色混成一片時，船艙內甲上，才頓然嘈雜起來！原來船已進港：有名的長崎港。只能看到一點側影。彷彿船便是傍在山邊，山上那密密的，特有風味的東洋屋子，低矮而顯精巧，隱約可辨。</p>
<p>海上旅程，遇着颶風襲擊，幾天來弄得分外狠狽，都急急想岸上去吃一頓可口的飯。所以捨棄了鑑賞山本的心情，等辦完手續，便紛紛登陸。</p>
<p>船，說是在長崎停一個半鐘頭，七點半開赴神戶。幾個餓人趕到一家中國飯店，已經燈火閃燦，時間去了好多。恐怕來不及，第一盤的牛排上來，囫圇的吞了少許，便急鍬走了。外國人總是最守時間的，七點半不會等到八貼開的。</p>
<p>回到船下，看見遍地煤堆，低矮的勞動者正在弄煤進船。大家上船，得失成敗氣，休息，閒談，失笑着；</p>
<p>「八點十分了呢！」</p>
<p>於是，趁社機會，旅客們走上甲板。我還沒有穿鞋，番草在外面叫着：</p>
<p>「出來看看啊！這夜景…」</p>
<p>憑攔而望，有些驚嘆，好像換換了一個境界了。就似置身巨大的墨鏡中。若</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>遠若近，如隱如現，旣神秘而又似清新。周圍是羅列相接的巧小的山頭，有高有低，環抱而成一個不大不小的湖般的港。</p>
<p>覺得是滿山燈火了。閃閃映照中，依稀露出一個有些羞澀的如處女的整個的長畸港的容姿。半山間層層木屋，只見樓窗朗明，精巧幽緻，如在目前，密密列過，街上車行，車燈如顆顆流星穿飛，點綴得山間的小都市活現。</p>
<p>久望愈覺奇妙。天空，像透明的烏水晶，像美女的黑夜服上，皇冠上，嵌着無數的閃光的珠子。是曠遠的去處，又如伸手可摘，山頭漸高，燈光漸稀，至山尖疎落，燈光便點點如倍明的星光，有的很巧妙的曲列七粒，如七星狀，亮得微閃紅光，雖許是人造的廣吿，但於此夜見，卻一點不俗。</p>
<p>再細觀良久，又可見山尖的燈光的較少處，有幾幾籠罩着銀霧，金沙似的亮光，那大概是山後的什麼燈火的反映。彷彿幾株發光的玉樹。毫光照出半面的青山的迴谷，美雅幽透，有神化之慨。山下木屋，低得如處水上，樓窗燈光，更覺與水相吻。岸邊小舟，輕盪細波，有若粒粒明珠在跳。上下左右，旣感澄清，也分外靜謐，長崎岸上的夜市，聽不見絲毫的音響。只覺渾然一片浩曠的清澈鮮美的夜氣。山，木屋，港水，整個的港，都露着島國的清巧的特色。長畸港，不如說是長崎湖吧！惟惟是在夜裏，見不着全部的容顏。</p>
<h3>吃飯難</h3>
<p>—</p>
<h3>鳥聲</h3>
<p>— 華穆</p>
<p>玩鳥的人不一定要有錢，第一還是有閒暇。據說有名好玩鳥的人當推北平的旗人，這些破落戶子弟，終日無所事事，肩頭上帶着一隻豢馴了的鳥兒，優游街頭茶館，日子全打發在一隻鳥的身上，把鳥當作性命着待，玩鳥玩到如此入勁，實時以名之為鳥迷也不為過分。其次蘇州人也說是有鳥癖的；上海城隍廟市里就有不少鳥店，那廟市里隨時都看得見一手托着鳥籠，慢條斯理踱着方步的玩鳥人。空地上，茶館里，就是他們的鳥兒出風頭的所在，評頭品足，論長比短，他們的日子也是為玩鳥而打發過去的。蘇州人賦性閑散，多文弱風，有此閑散的個性，生活自然看得瑣細，也是一大原因。</p>
<p>大凡玩鳥總不外因鳥能跳善鬥，還會唱出美妙動聽的歌娛人心意。雖有人是專喜鬥鳥，但喜唱鳥的終怕居多，重廉之下，一壼清茗，聽屋門前後深林綠葉之間，百鳥細細長歌歡唱，那種悠閑清凈的幽趣，確實耐人沉醉。有人說聽鳥鳴可以陶冶心性，也確有道理，不過這裡所謂的陶冶，只專指閑談清靜的胸懷而言罷了。</p>
<p>一般住在都市里的人們，自然不容易享到這個清福，莫說陶冶心性，即生性愛鳥的也只能把鳥買來關在竹籠里，吊在廳堂前玩玩，這自然已經減少了太半自然風趣，鳥唱雖同，境地則異。在鄉村里，晨間有晨間的鳥唱，午晚有午晚的鳥鳴，即在夜間也有隨更而鳴的更鳥；而且百鳥交唱；人們都能在某種鳥聲里分出吉凶哀樂的差別。據古人的傳說，公冶長能識鳥語，事雖無根，也未可就所其妄。因為根據現代科學方法去研究鳥獸的生活，尚可得知其性，又何常不可以說公冶長至少也識得鳥性呢？這雖是離開了純為玩鳥而說的話，而較之只能在廳堂前玩玩聽竹籠子里的秀眼，百靈，畫眉的都市中人可自有差別了。</p>
<p>在鄉村里，一般習見都愛喜鵲而惡烏鴉的。別地知如何，我鄉對於鳥聲的迷信是很深的，若果一朝喜鵲飛鳴瓦棟，大家必竊竊自喜，認作遠人的平安家信已郵喜鵲先來報到了。假使是烏鴉，那就慄慄自危，以為報喪的凶鳥已來。因有此等迷信作用，喜鵲縱會把小鷄抓去，也得優游自在，不致見害槍火。平心說來，鵲鴉的鳴聲，二者實都不相伯仲，而愛憎則相　若是，這可是鵲鴉的幸與不幸的。</p>
<p>梟生活於夜間，故不常見。我鄉習見，把梟簡直目為死神使者。當風高月黑之夜，若有梟鳴屋前左右，碰巧屋里有人病人，那恐怖之情可很悽慘，認為病人萬無生望，但也很巧，常多應驗。而梟的鳴聲確也可怖之極，聽起來即似有一股陰森之氣襲上身來，寒人毛髮。我雖聽過一次，時為冷冬十月之一夜，月黑風厲，與幾個族兄弟夜談正濃，忽有鳴鳴的聲音由屋後園林，漸下至屋前，當時的怖懼之狀，至今想來就有餘怖。</p>
<p>玩鳥我雖無此閑情，山林鄉野之間欣賞鳥聲可還高興，這也許是自幼生息鄉村養成的。現在雖是住在邸外，但仍很少鳥聲可聽，晨晚之間，梧桐白楊之上，只有幾隻麻雀而已；間雖有一二聲斑鳩又需在雨晴前後才聽得見。像故鄉的唳喨於長空的山鷹，迎晨高唱的百勞，這又更無從聽到了。</p>

<p>是劇情節，寫朱冬心與馬妮娜二人之情愛，極細膩深刻之至，中間更雜以社會問題，生活問題，加以醒豁之捷警，尤饒意意味，聞朱冬心由梅　充飾，馬妮娜由王人美充飾，個性均屬十分適合。</p>
<h3>光陸開映「情天血淚」</h3>

<p>「欽差大臣」日前本每晚假金城排演，最近因上海在即，故日間假月明公司再行排練，以資純熟。</p>
<p>我終覺得，袁美雲喫電影飯是喫錯了，她最好是唱京戲，回復到他「小女伶」生活去，譬如「掛頭牌」，演電影便沒有京戲來得出風頭，至少袁美雲三個字在報上出現時，便不會像梅蘭芳那般的比戲名來得大，至於在名字上圍以雪亮的電燈或用霓虹綴成名字，那更是唱京戲纜有的風頭。</p>
<p>要「掛頭牌」的袁美雲，何不從此改行？</p>

Relevant parties claimed that the matter is under negotiation and must be resolved within a day or two. If the rioters do not come to their senses, they will use force with the consent of the Japanese. (31st Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Peiping) The Hebei Provincial Government is working hard to take measures for the aftermath of the Xianghe incident. Because the leaders of the rioters, Wu Yiting, etc., have a stubborn attitude, the security team has not been able to enter the city for garrisoning. Wang Runsheng, etc., sent by the Provincial Government and the Civil Affairs Department, are making every effort to negotiate, and a final result can be obtained in the next few days. The security team is currently stationed about seven li outside the city, taking a monitoring attitude. If the rioters have any changes, they will be severely attacked at any time.

<h3>Closing of the Sixth Plenary Session</h3>
<p>--- Dao</p>
<p>The Sixth Plenary Session opens today with, according to reports, attendance exceeding that of all previous plenary sessions. This is indeed a very good sign. According to the current Kuomintang General Charter, the plenary session of the Central Executive Committee should be convened every six months. However, this plenary session was delayed until today because it was intended to be held consecutively with the Fifth National Congress, which is more than ten months since the last plenary session was convened. During this interval, although the Central Standing Committee and other central agencies are responsible for the implementation of party and government facilities, most of the Central Committee members are scattered all over the country, making it difficult to get together. Thus, the emotional distance and differences in opinion are almost inevitable. Now that we are gathered together to discuss national affairs, the gaps in understanding that have occurred on weekdays should be narrowed considerably. Here, I offer a personal opinion in the hope that the attending Central Committee members will give it their attention.</p>
<p>China today is externally constrained by the pressure from powerful neighbors and internally plagued by the combination of natural and man-made disasters. The national situation is precarious, like a pile of eggs. Survival depends on the completion of national unification and the rapid advancement of construction projects. Recently, although the Red Scourge in the hinterland has been wiped out, its remaining forces are still plotting to occupy remote provinces in the northwest. In order to eliminate the worries of national internal affairs and seek a once-and-for-all plan, how should we deal with this? This is an issue that the plenary session should pay attention to. Chairman Chiang has said that in order to effectively suppress bandits, politics and military affairs must complement each other. Many knowledgeable people in the country also take resolving the land problem as the key. These are all undeniable arguments. Now that the military aspect has come to an end, how to implement political measures is urgently necessary for a comprehensive plan. This is what we hope from the Central Committee members. Since the outbreak of national disasters, all parties have been running around calling for sincere unity as the only important thing. However, in fact, suspicions and divisions have not been completely eliminated, and the steps of action have not been fully consistent. The cold sarcasm that "China is only a geographical term" has not been thoroughly washed away. Therefore, if we want to gather the power of China to revive the nation, it is difficult to exert its greatest effect. Since the Kuomintang bears the full responsibility for building the country, and at this juncture of national survival, it has not been able to make the national unification cause, which the people most hope for, a reality at an early date, is it any wonder that the people are disappointed in it? How can we promote the unification of the national military, administration, and other aspects in the future in order to accelerate the effectiveness of construction projects? This is the second thing that must be done urgently. The promotion of the rule of law is a necessary condition for political integrity, and the key lies in having a sound and legal political institution. Recently, the Legislative Yuan's revision of the draft constitution has been able to emphasize this point, and it is hoped that it will be supported by a majority of the assembly. What we hope for is that after this plenary session and the Fifth National Congress complete the review of this draft, we should find a way to convene a National Assembly as soon as possible so that constitutional government can be achieved early, the will of the people can be expressed, and a broader foundation can be established for the Kuomintang, which will be of great benefit to promoting the unity of the whole country. This is the third. In previous meetings, proposals were often as numerous as hairs, and the number of resolutions was also considerable. However, according to reality, they are not necessarily all feasible. We believe that the proposals do not need to be numerous, and the theories do not need to be high. The important thing is to be able to implement them effectively without failing. Therefore, before resolving a case, it is essential to discard emotions and discuss it with an open mind, taking the welfare of the country as the premise. This is the fourth condition.</p>
<p>In short, the fate of the country today rests on the Kuomintang, and the responsibility of the Central Committee members is even greater. If the talented people in the party can all be of one heart and one mind, put aside private interests, and only put the country first, then even if the national disaster is extremely serious, there is still hope for survival.</p>

Chairman Ju Zheng presided over the ceremony, and after leading the attendees in observing the rituals, delivered a report, stating in brief that we have two reasons for commemorating the martyr Huang, which we cannot forget, and these are the most indelible aspects of Mr. Huang's life. First, the great spirit of Huang Xianlie, who did not shy away from hardship for the sake of revolution and strived for unity, is a model for all party comrades. Second, the Huanghuagang Uprising led by Huang Xianlie, with the blood and heads of many nameless martyrs, secured the success of the revolution, enabling our party to have what it has today, which we cannot forget. We hope that all comrades will emulate the spirit of the martyrs, inherit their unfinished wishes, and strive diligently so that we can overcome all difficulties and shoulder the heavy responsibility of national rejuvenation. The meeting adjourned after Ju's speech. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 31st)</p>

<h3>The Focus of Diplomacy Shifts to Geneva; Britain, France, and Italy Seek a Solution for Reconciliation; Representatives from the Three Countries Will Conduct Negotiations Outside the Conference; the League of Nations Sanctions Committee Convened Yesterday</h3>
<p>(Geneva) General public opinion here believes that as long as the war continues, the issue of delaying the implementation of sanctions will not arise. British Foreign Secretary Hoare, French Prime Minister Laval, and Italian representative Aloisi will all arrive in Geneva tomorrow. This is seen as extremely important, as the situation seems to be closer to a resolution than most people imagine. The meeting of key figures from the three countries should lead to satisfactory results. However, the British side is not so optimistic, believing that all previous exchanges of views were only preliminary in nature. (Reuters dispatch from the 31st)</p>
<p>(Rome) Italian Chief Delegate to the League of Nations Sir Aloisi departed today for Geneva, as millions of people in the country devoutly pray for peace. According to French sources, Prime Minister Mussolini is aware of his "very dangerous" position and is willing to make significant concessions. (Guomin News dispatch from the 31st)</p>
<p>(Geneva) French Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Laval, British Foreign Secretary Hoare, and Italian representative Aloisi will meet here in Geneva to discuss possible solutions to the Italo-Ethiopian dispute. This is seen as extremely important. According to those familiar with international affairs, Mussolini's order for Aloisi to return to Geneva was the result of strong persuasion from Britain and France, so the negotiations that began half a month ago can continue through diplomatic channels. This negotiation can develop in Geneva, and it will have extremely significant political implications.</p>
<p>Addis Ababa According to well-informed sources, the Italian government's willingness to resume diplomatic negotiations to seek a peaceful resolution to the Italo-Ethiopian dispute is due to the countless difficulties faced by the Italian expeditionary force in Ethiopia. (Havas dispatch from the 30th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Ethiopian government recently notified the Secretariat of the League of Nations that it has appointed its ambassador to France, Gedda Warad, to succeed Hawa Rid as its representative to the League of Nations. (Havas dispatch from the 30th)</p>
<h3>Britain and France Work Together to Bring Italy to Heel</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The representatives of Britain and France to the League of Nations plan to establish a method for mediating the Italo-Ethiopian dispute by the end of this week, in order to avoid imposing a blockade on Italy. League of Nations representatives believe that after the meeting tomorrow decides on a date to begin boycotting Italy, Italy will realize the seriousness of the situation, and Mussolini will be able to make concessions, so as to peacefully resolve the issue. (Guomin News dispatch from the 30th)</p>
<h3>More Than Two Weeks Available for Negotiations</h3>
<p>(Geneva) Diplomats claimed tonight that informal negotiations between Britain, France, and Italy will also be held after the League of Nations Sanctions Committee meets on Thursday. This meeting will probably decide to set November 15 as the date for the start of boycotting Italian goods and banning the import of important products to Italy. In this way, there are more than two weeks available for peaceful negotiations. Italian representative Aloisi will come here on Friday and will probably discuss everything with French Foreign Minister Laval and British Foreign Secretary Hoare, based on the peace plan of Britain and France. However, diplomats still do not believe that there is any hope of success because the opinions of Britain and Italy are still very different. Observers generally believe that the speed with which the member states of the League of Nations are imposing the most severe sanctions on Italy this time is beyond expectations. This point should also enable Mussolini to carefully consider any fair proposal. (Guomin News dispatch from the 30th)</p>
<h3>British Policy Remains Unchanged</h3>
<p>Chelmsford Foreign Secretary Hoare said in a speech here today that Britain's policy on the Italo-Ethiopian dispute will not change. Britain and France are currently exchanging views, but there are no results yet. If there is an agreement, it should be reported to the League of Nations, and the final solution must be satisfactory to the League of Nations and Italy and Ethiopia. Chancellor Chamberlain said in a speech in London that Britain does not approve of any proposals for rearmament other than those necessary for national security. (Guomin News dispatch from the 30th)</p>
<h3>Italian Conditions Harm Ethiopian Sovereignty</h3>
<p>(Paris) Political figures believe that the British and French plan to mediate the Italo-Ethiopian dispute will be based on the recommendations of the five-nation subcommittee of the League of Nations Administrative Council in September. The main idea is to divide Ethiopia into two parts: Ethiopia proper and the border provinces conquered by the former Ethiopian emperor. It is also believed that Mussolini now understands that the use of force in Ethiopia has caused huge losses in lives and property, so he may stop at the right time. Italy will probably demand the annexation of the land south of the Weibei Hibili River to Lake Rodolfo. In addition, a large part of Ethiopian territory may be used as a mandated territory, and an outlet to the sea may be given to Ethiopia as compensation. If so, it may be satisfied, and it is not known whether it will be resolved according to such conditions in the future. (Havas dispatch from the 30th)</p>
<h3>Hoare and Laval Depart for Geneva</h3>
<p>(Paris) British Foreign Secretary Hoare came here from London by train today, arriving in Paris at approximately 8:40 p.m., and then took a train to Geneva at 11:20 p.m. to attend the League of Nations General Assembly Sanctions Committee. (Havas dispatch from the 31st)</p>
<p>(Geneva) British Foreign Secretary Hoare will arrive here tomorrow. It is said that unless the diplomatic negotiations are progressing smoothly, Hoare will only be able to stay for two or three days and must leave Geneva and return home before the first day of next week. According to people from the British delegation, the purpose of Foreign Secretary Hoare's visit is to explain British policy, and the specific basis for diplomatic talks has not yet been established. It is also said that the British delegation has not brought any agreement plan for discussion. (Havas dispatch from the 31st)</p>
<p>(Paris) Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Laval took a car to Geneva at 1:00 p.m. (Havas dispatch from the 31st)</p>
<h3>The Eighteen-Nation Subcommittee Convened Yesterday Morning for a Preliminary Study of the Replies from Various Countries; Most Accepted Various Sanctions Measures</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The Eighteen-Nation Subcommittee of the League of Nations General Assembly Sanctions Committee met at 11:00 a.m. for a very short time, only to conduct a preliminary study of the replies submitted by the governments of the member states of the League of Nations on the issue of sanctions, and then adjourned. As of 11:00 a.m. this morning, 45 member states have accepted the arms embargo against Italy, 43 have accepted financial sanctions, 42 have accepted economic sanctions, and 20 have accepted economic mutual assistance. It is also said that at the meeting of the Eighteen-Nation Subcommittee this morning, the issue of whether the remaining parts of the contracts that have been partially fulfilled between various countries and Italy should also be subject to sanctions was discussed. As a result, it was decided that purchase contracts for which the payment has been fully paid will not be subject to sanctions. (Havas dispatch from the 31st)</p>
<p>(Geneva) British cabinet member Eden arrived here today and immediately joined the Eighteen-Nation Committee to consider subsequent sanctions measures. The report submitted by the committee to the Sanctions Adjustment Committee this afternoon will probably advocate the implementation of the third and fourth sanctions, namely, excluding Italian exports and prohibiting the import of major items to Italy. (Reuters dispatch from the 31st)</p>
<p>(Geneva) French Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Laval recently notified the Secretariat of the League of Nations, stating that France can accept the economic mutual assistance measures for countries participating in sanctions, but said that in France's opinion, this type of mutual assistance measures must first be negotiated bilaterally by the countries concerned before they can be implemented. (Havas dispatch from the 31st)</p>
<p>Lisbon The government recently issued an order: (1) To prohibit the export of military equipment, ammunition, and war supplies to Italy and its territories, whether directly or through transshipment, and export through Portugal is prohibited. (2) Prohibit the purchase of Italian bonds, or the granting of bank loans or other loans to Italian government companies and people. (Havas dispatch from the 31st)</p>
<p>Cairo The League of Nations recently formally notified the Egyptian government of its resolution to implement sanctions against Italy, and requested it to submit a written opinion to the League of Nations. (Note: Egypt is not a member of the League of Nations) (Havas dispatch from the 31st)</p>
<h3>Italian Prime Minister's Stirring Speech; Resisting Sanctions with All Efforts; Advocating a National Movement to Widely Use Domestic Goods; Extracting Marsh Gas from the Strata to Replace Fuel</h3>
<p>(Rome) Mussolini delivered a stirring speech to the student assembly at the inauguration ceremony of the new university here today, vowing to fight the League of Nations' sanctions to the end, and said that the economic blockade should make all civilized countries in the world feel ashamed. We will do our best to resist this kind of test on the Italians. You college students should be at the forefront. Taking this as a gymnasium, we are now creating a university here, and our soldiers are also fighting on the front line to spread civilization. (Guomin News dispatch from the 31st)</p>
<p>(Rome) The government recently issued a notice to the widows and elderly mothers of soldiers who died in the European War, asking them to carry out large-scale activities to resist economic sanctions throughout the country. The method is for them to organize committees in various provinces to supervise whether domestic products are absolutely used in people's homes. The notice also recalled the common sacrifices made by Britain, France, and Italy during the Great War, and Italy was the only one who was not rewarded after the war. (Havas dispatch from the 31st)</p>
<p>(Rome) The Italian Royal Automobile Club recently launched a search for the best substitute for engine gasoline, in order to reduce the amount of gasoline imported. In some provinces of Italy, gas fuel has long been used for freight cars and buses. The most prominent is the "marsh gas" contained in the hydrocarbons in the strata of the provinces of Tuscany and Emilia. A factory has now been established in the city of Salsa Machiel to extract this natural marsh gas and bottle it for use. (Havas dispatch from the 31st)</p>
<p>(Rome) Prime Minister Mussolini will probably go to Lido di Roma before November 13 to participate in the wheat sowing ceremony, and go to Cocchia di Morto to inspect the overseas Chinese volunteer army stationed there. (Havas dispatch from the 31st)</p>
<h3>Britain Supplies Ethiopia with Military Supplies; Difficulties Arise in the Issue of Advances</h3>
<p>(London) Banking circles believe that the Ethiopian government will negotiate with consortia here in order to obtain advances for the purchase of military supplies. However, it is said that the negotiations are quite difficult, as arms manufacturers require 25% of the payment upon ordering, and the remaining 75% must be paid in full before the ordered goods are shipped. In addition, Ethiopia has requested loans of 2 million pounds from banking circles here, and the collateral is all within Ethiopia, such as shares of the railway from the Ethiopian capital to the Port of Djibouti, the silver reserve of the Ethiopian issuing agency, and Ethiopian mineral concessions. Under the current serious situation, this collateral is equal to nothing, so banking circles here seem to have no intention of handling this loan. (TASS dispatch from the 31st)</p>
<p>(London) Secretary of Commerce Runciman recently declared that the Department of Commerce will not be responsible for any debts for British goods sold to Italy. As of now, the commercial debts owed by Italy for purchasing British goods amount to 2,013,870 pounds, while the debts owed by Britain to Italian exporters amount to only 1,000,774 pounds. (Havas dispatch from the 31st)</p>
<h3>British Petroleum Company Sells Kerosene to Italy; Explanation by the British Undersecretary</h3>
<p>(London) Former Liberal Prime Minister Lloyd George criticized the British Petroleum Company for selling kerosene to Italy in a speech yesterday. Undersecretary of the Foreign Office, Earl Stanhope, recently defended it, saying that if Britain stops exporting kerosene to Italy, the United States will inevitably take its place. "Regarding certain goods, if Italy can trade with other countries, then even if we refuse to sell them to Italy, what's the use?" (Havas dispatch from the 31st)</p>
<h3>The U.S. President Urges People Not to Trade with Belligerent Countries; A Sign of Sympathy for the League of Nations' Sanctions; Geneva is Delighted to Hear the News; U.S. Exports to Italy Decreased by $800,000 in September</h3>
<p>(Washington) Following Secretary of State Hull's clarification of the United States' neutral policy, President Roosevelt guaranteed that nothing has yet occurred that would cause the United States to be drawn into foreign wars, and said that the government's purpose is twofold: (1) to avoid war; (2) not to prolong the current war. The President further stated that the government is paying attention to the trade between the American people and the belligerent countries at all times. (Guomin News dispatch from the 30th)</p>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt issued an article in the White House today, warning American exporters that the government is currently carefully investigating various items being shipped to Italy and Ethiopia. The government is determined not to be involved in this dispute and sincerely hopes that peace will be restored and maintained. Although the opportunity to supply raw materials and obtain high profits may tempt merchants, I do not believe that the American people are willing to expand the trade in raw materials that can prolong the war and obtain temporary abnormal benefits, or to want the war to last and benefit a few people. President Roosevelt's remarks are highly valued by observers, as they were issued on the eve of the Sanctions Adjustment Committee of the League of Nations' decision on the date of implementation of economic sanctions against Italy. People here believe that these remarks contain the intention of making the people of the country automatically comply with the State Department's policy of not increasing exports to belligerent countries. If they do not comply automatically, President Roosevelt may consider legislation to prohibit the export of raw materials to Italy and Ethiopia. (Reuters dispatch from the 30th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Secretary of State Hull issued a statement today, urging the American people not to trade with belligerent countries for temporary and dangerous profits, as this trade is at the expense of human lives and tragedies. It was learned today that Hull and Undersecretary of State Phillips met with President Roosevelt on Tuesday to discuss cooperation between the United States and the League of Nations to stop American people from trading with the people of belligerent countries. (Guomin News dispatch from the 30th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Representatives of the League of Nations were very pleased to hear the announcement made by U.S. Secretary of State Hull in Washington. It is believed here that Hull's advice to the American people to cut off trade with belligerent countries is sufficient to show that the United States sympathizes with the League of Nations' sanctions efforts. (Guomin News dispatch from the 31st)</p>
<p>(Washington) According to a report from the Chamber of Commerce, U.S. exports to Italy decreased by $800,000 in September compared to August. (Reuters dispatch from the 30th)</p>
<p>(Washington) The Department of Commerce announced today that U.S. exports to Italy in September were valued at $4,795,887, compared to $4,741,659 in the same month last year. U.S. exports to the UK in September of this year were $53,513,431, compared to $40,119,254 in the same month last year.

<h3>The Initiator of the Kellogg-Briand Pact Reproaches Italy as an Aggressor; Using War as an Instrument of National Policy; This Action Clearly Violates the Treaty with the U.S.</h3>
<p>São Paulo Former U.S. politician Kellogg, who created the Kellogg-Briand Pact, said in a radio broadcast here tonight that the United States should designate Italy as an aggressor, openly undermining the sovereignty of other countries. The United States should also declare Italy guilty of violating its treaty obligations. The United States must also declare that it will not interfere with or undermine any plans currently being adopted by other countries for the purpose of stopping the East African war. Italy is undoubtedly using war as an instrument of national policy, and its actions are violating its treaty with the U.S. and U.S. supreme law. (Reuters dispatch from the 31st)</p>
<h3>Amidst the World Economic Panic, the Arms Trade Alone Sees Activity</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations recently released statistics on the total value of worldwide arms exports in 1934, totaling 41,500,000 gold dollars. Compared to the total export value of 35,400,000 gold dollars in 1931, this proves that since the outbreak of the worldwide economic panic in 1929, the arms export industry has uniquely increased in international trade.

<h3>Britain Asks Italy to Further Withdraw Troops from Libya; Mussolini Refuses</h3>
<p>(Rome) According to political observers, Britain is hoping that Italy will withdraw another division of its troops stationed in Libya, Africa. This matter was discussed yesterday by the British Ambassador to Italy, Sir Drummond, and Prime Minister Mussolini. However, it is said that the Prime Minister refused this request because Britain has not yet recalled any warships from the Mediterranean. It is also said that the Prime Minister stated to Drummond that even if sanctions are implemented, Italy is still determined to continue its conquest of Abyssinia. (30th Havas Wire)</p>
<p>(Paris) According to a report from the Rome correspondent of the Economic and Financial News Agency, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini was very firm in his attitude during his recent meeting with British Ambassador Sir Drummond, stating that regardless of Britain's strong stance, Italy's military operations in Africa will continue at any cost and there is no possibility of stopping. According to another source, if the League of Nations does not adopt a firm attitude towards Italy, an agreement on resolving the Italo-Ethiopian dispute can be reached within the League of Nations framework. The correspondent also said that the Italian troops within Libya, Africa, are only under orders to prepare for departure, but have not actually started returning home. (31st Havas Wire)</p>
<p>(London) British Ambassador to Italy, Sir Drummond, paid a visit to Italian Prime Minister Mussolini yesterday for discussions. According to political sources, the two men discussed the issue of Britain withdrawing its warships stationed in the Mediterranean. Drummond reportedly stated that Italy has not fulfilled all the conditions, so Britain cannot withdraw its warships from the Mediterranean. It is said that Britain previously put forward three conditions: (1) The number of Italian troops stationed in Libya, Africa, should not exceed the British forces in Egypt; (2) The Italian government should cease anti-British propaganda in Italian Libya and in the British sphere of influence in the Near East; (3) Italian newspapers should stop attacking Britain. According to official sources, Anglo-Italian negotiations have not yet materialized, but the door for future negotiations remains open. (31st Havas Wire)</p>
<p>(London) It is reported that British Ambassador to Rome, Sir Drummond, was very serious in his conversation with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini on October 29th. The knight reiterated that Britain has no dispute with Italy and is determined to fulfill its League of Nations obligations. At the same time, the Italian press continues to attack Britain. The British government welcomes the withdrawal of an Italian division from Libya, but believes that the strength of the Italian forces in Libya still exceeds their normal needs. London has now firmly stated that unless there is a general improvement in the situation between Britain and Italy, the British fleet in the Mediterranean cannot be reduced. (31st Reuters Wire)</p>
<h3>Former British Foreign Secretary Simon Explains British Policy: Maintaining Peace Under Collective System</h3>
<p>(London) London bankers are quite worried about the weakness of the currency prices in China and Hong Kong, and the fall of the Hong Kong dollar is due to excessive purchases of pounds sterling and gold coins, estimated to be between two and three million pounds. Some merchants told a Reuters reporter that they could not obtain their usual commercial needs. Although the London foreign exchange market appears calm on the surface, there is some panic about the French franc. Paris is now selling government bonds and buying oil stocks to seek capital security, as the French government's economic measures are gradually being opposed. (31st Reuters Wire)</p>

The sailors on these ships must all be Italian. Merchant ships under ten years old must be approved by the Naval Department before being sold abroad. (30th Reuters Wire)</p>

<h3>Italian Army Disregards Costs in a Desperate Gamble; War in East Africa Imminent; General Offensive from North and South Completed; Ethiopia Concentrates Large Forces to Block Enemy Advance</h3>
<p>Djibouti: Reliable sources from three fronts in the Ethiopian war zone today all indicate that the Italian army is eager for an early victory in the Ogaden province and has therefore made a desperate gamble. (30th National Telegram)</p>
<p>(Rome) According to news received here, the Italian army on the northern front in Ethiopia has completed all preparations and will launch a major offensive on the Tigre front. A similar action is expected on the southern front in Italian Somaliland. The Tigre front now forms an arc, with the center extending to the south of Hosan Town (60 kilometers southeast of Adwa), while the flanks continue to scout. Some units from Adwa on the right flank have reached the Tekeze River, and units from Adigrat on the left flank have actually reached Magale. Although the Italian army once entered the city, they were unable to occupy it for long due to strong resistance from Ethiopian forces in the surrounding area and retreated. The Ethiopian forces gathered in that area include 100,000 troops under General Gasa and 100,000 troops under General Seyoum, totaling 200,000 men, concentrated in the Tambien area west of Magale. In addition, unknown numbers of Ethiopian troops are stationed in the Antalo area southeast of Magale. These troops are all from the Ethiopian mainland and are not natives of the border provinces. It is generally expected that the Italian army will launch an attack from Adigrat with heavy forces, while sending detachments to monitor the actions of the Ethiopian army in the Tambien area to prevent the Italian army on the right flank from being ambushed by the enemy. The war on the Somaliland front in the south is of secondary importance. Its primary goal is to occupy Bangora on the coast, and then advance from that town towards Warder, Sassabaneh, and Harar. (31st Havas Wire)</p>
<p>Harar: The major battle on the Ogaden front has already begun today. Nasi Puh and Dundu, the governor of Sidamo province and son-in-law of the Ethiopian Emperor, led 350,000 Ethiopian troops to attack the Italian army advancing towards Jijiga, Harar, and Dire Dawa. According to reports from the front, the Ethiopian army is showing great spirit in resisting Italian tanks, armored vehicles, and aircraft. General Graziani, who commands the Italian Somaliland soldiers, is still using aerial bombardment to clear the way, followed by tanks and Askaris (native infantry) to carry out mopping-up operations. According to information obtained here, the Italian army plans to converge on the town of Macallé from three directions. The main force of the Ethiopian army is west of that town, and the main battle is about to break out. Macalle is located south of Mount Mailebo and east of Qori. (20th National Telegram)</p>
<p>(London) The Italian army is now planning a major offensive in the Musa Ali Mountains in the northeastern corner of Ethiopia's Aussa province. The aim is clearly to reduce the difficulty of the Italian army's future attack on Magale on the northern front, as this move would allow the Italian army to cross the Danakil Desert and reach Tadjoura. Official circles in the Ethiopian capital received reports today that the Italian army will advance with aircraft, infantry, and cavalry simultaneously during the offensive. The troops under Italian General Graziani on the southern front are also gradually advancing. According to news from Rome, after the Italian reserve troops occupied the Hiraf fort, they are now rapidly advancing towards Gorahei. It is reported that the Italian and Ethiopian armies fought fiercely in Aiezis, with both sides charging with bayonets. After a short period of resistance, the Ethiopian army was defeated and abandoned many rifles, and many were captured. (30th Reuters Wire)</p>
<h3>Fierce Resistance Encountered by Italian Army Along the Shebelle River</h3>
<p>Addis Ababa: It is reported that Generals Seyoum and Gasa have led their troops westward to encircle the cities of Adwa and Adigrat and cut off the road connecting those two cities to Magale. The troops guarding that road are those led by Ethiopian General Gugsa. According to news from the southern front, the troops under Italian General Graziani have encountered fierce resistance along the Shebelle River. Ethiopian warriors are adopting guerrilla tactics, exhausting the Italian army to the point where they can no longer sustain their positions. In addition, news from the Harar front states that the Arsi Oromo soldiers led by General Mashashu are concentrating 60,000 men in Harar, having already arrived there, with the rest soon to arrive. A Belgian military officer has arrived in the capital, claiming that 50 more Belgian officers will arrive in Ethiopia within days to assist the Ethiopian army in combat. (13th Havas Wire)</p>
<h3>Italian Troops Fight Bitterly and Exhaust Themselves in Rugged Northern Mountains</h3>
<p>Addis Ababa: After capturing the city of Adwa, the Italian army originally planned to drive straight into Addis Ababa. However, a month has passed since the outbreak of the war, and the Italian army has advanced only 50 kilometers in the Tigre province in the north and no more than 150 kilometers in the Ogaden region in the south. At the same time, the Ethiopian army is concentrating with extraordinary speed. General Seyoum's main force has now concentrated south of Aksum in Gondar province, while the Italian army is still searching everywhere in the Hawzen area. The Tigre province and the Hawzen area are covered with mountains, making it easy for Ethiopian troops to hide, making it impossible for Italian aircraft to see. As a result, the Italian army does not know the true situation, chasing back and forth and exhausting themselves. It has been reported from Dire Dawa that troops are moving south continuously on the road from Dire Dawa to Harar, indicating that the Italian army's general offensive is about to begin. (30th Havas Wire)</p>
<h3>Headquarters Set Up in Tadjoura; Ethiopian Emperor Prepares to Personally Lead the Campaign</h3>
<p>Addis Ababa: It is reported that when the Ethiopian Emperor personally leads the expedition, most of the cabinet members and trusted advisors will accompany him, but the date has not yet been determined. According to news from the front, the Italian army is preparing to advance north of Mount Musa Ali, planning to pass through the Danakil Desert near Tadjoura, which is why the Ethiopian army's northern headquarters is now located in Tadjoura. (31st Havas Wire)</p>
<p>(Rome) The number of people migrating from the Ethiopian capital is increasing daily, as the Ethiopian Emperor will soon travel to Tadjoura, which is likely to become the general base camp for the Ethiopian army on the northern front. People from various tribes are moving towards Tadjoura, each team led by a leader. Thousands of women are carrying bedding, and children are following the soldiers to the front lines. Most of the Ethiopian cabinet members will go to the war zone and are now packing their bags in preparation for departure. After they leave the capital, their duties will be handled by lower-ranking officials. (31st Reuters Wire)</p>

<h3>Former Ambassador to France States: Vow to Resist to the End; Rather Die in Defeat than Surrender Territory</h3>
<p>Addis Ababa: Haile Warried, the former Ethiopian Ambassador to France and representative to the League of Nations, returned to the country yesterday and made a statement to the press, acknowledging that negotiations are currently underway between Britain, France, and Italy to resolve the Italo-Ethiopian dispute, but stating that Ethiopia cannot accept any proposal unless the Italian army withdraws from Ethiopian territory. He also stated, "In any case, Ethiopia is determined to resist to the end, preferring to die in defeat rather than willingly surrender territory." Finally, he said, "After various countries lift the ban on the transport of munitions to Ethiopia, all Ethiopian military supplies will be able to match those of Italy. Italy previously had the advantage of using new weapons to win, but in the future, this advantage may not be so reliable." (30th Havas Wire)</p>
<h3>Britain and France Strive for Broad Naval Cooperation; Secret Talks Held in London</h3>
<p>(London) As a result of the development of the Italian Air Force, the safety of Malta, the British naval base in the Mediterranean, is at risk. Therefore, British naval experts are holding talks in London to discuss how to obtain French assistance to ensure the security of the British Navy in the Mediterranean. It is believed that a result can be obtained, but well-informed sources believe that these talks are not limited to the Mediterranean. In fact, it will include broad cooperation between the British and French navies. France hopes to receive British naval assistance in the North Sea in the event of a German attack, which is also under discussion. Germany's current and future policies are designed to target Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union. If Britain and France can establish a mutual assistance agreement to deter Germany from invading the East, the future of European diplomatic policy will be greatly changed. However, the future development of the Anglo-French mutual assistance agreement will depend on the outcome of the British general election, France's attitude towards the Italo-Ethiopian conflict, and the fate of the League of Nations. (30th Havas Wire)</p>
<p>(London) British and French naval experts are currently holding talks here in preparation for the London Naval Conference to be opened on December 2nd, and to discuss the technical issues of Anglo-French naval cooperation in the Mediterranean in accordance with Article 16, Paragraph 3 of the League of Nations Covenant (referring to the issue of the French Navy taking over after the withdrawal of British warships, and the British Navy using French military ports). Official sources claim that these talks must be kept secret and regret the various comments and speculations published in newspapers at present. (30th Havas Wire)</p>

<h3>Pei County Rushes to Build City Embankments</h3>
<p>(Xuzhou) Commissioner Tian Huanxiang, dispatched by the Commissioner's Office, reported from Pei that the water level around Pei city has dropped by 7-8 centimeters in recent days, but due to unstable wind direction, there is still concern. Currently, the entire city is concentrating its efforts to rush the construction of city embankments. The entire city perimeter is 2,118 meters long and must be completed within a limited time. About 100 civilian boats have been requisitioned to transport soil and prevent waves. It is found that Pei City was relocated three times in the past during the Qing Dynasty to avoid floods. The current county seat is the former Lijia Village, which is a clay embankment, so protection is difficult. Raising the city walls and building crenellations will make it more solid.

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>— Lu Yu Dao</p>
<p>The China Science Society has reached the age of twenty. During these twenty years of struggle, it has interacted with society through research institutes, libraries, various science series, science monthly magazines, science picture magazines, and various popular lectures. We have exerted all our intelligence to contribute science to our society. In the past decade, we have gradually gained social support and recognition, but our repayment is still inseparable from scientific research. Now we are thinking that some of the various scientific undertakings we have done in the past are too specialized, and perhaps cannot be popularized to the masses. Therefore, from today onwards, we are cooperating with Shenbao to publish the "Science Talks". Shenbao is the only major newspaper with the longest history in the country. Its spirit of serving culture has remained consistent for more than sixty years. Today we offer this small gift (science) to readers, which must be welcomed by everyone.</p>
<p>We believe that what China lacks is science. We believe that the twentieth century is the age of science, and we also believe that to modernize China, we cannot do without science. However, developing science is definitely not something that a few scientists can do alone, so we hope to popularize science. Even though the editors of these talks are all science experts, what they are talking about are common scientific facts. What is being discussed in these talks is scientific principles, but the way they are discussed is very popular and easy to understand. We have set aside a portion of our specialized research time, hoping that this scientific knowledge will be spread from the minds of a few people to everyone's minds. We also hope that readers can learn from these talks some of the wonders of the sky, the growth and decline of life, the profundity of physics, the mystery of chemistry, and all the fresh and new things in science. Gradually, we will make life scientific, and further make China scientific and science Chinese, so that we will be worthy of the hundreds of thousands of readers who love Shenbao and the China Science Society. This will serve as the opening remarks for this series of talks.</p>
<h3>Idle Chat About Autumn Stars</h3>
<p>— Zhang Yu Zhe</p>
<p>The book "Idle Chat About Yangzhou" failed to write the entire piece as one that hides evil and promotes good, and thus caused a storm. However, the topic "Idle Chat About Autumn Stars" should be without any danger. It is such a pleasant thing to be able to speak freely without fear of offending anyone.</p>
<p>Lu Fangweng's poem contains the two lines "The Dipper's handle points southwest, densely and clearly, the Milky Way flows from ancient times to the present, radiantly," which can be said to perfectly capture the starry sky of autumn nights. Originally, the autumn sky is high and clear, and the jade-like sky is without dust. The clearest weather of the year can only be found in autumn. Every time you look up at the sky on an autumn night, you can see the Milky Way like a light cloud veil, stretching across the sky from northeast to southwest. Heavenly River, Star River, Cloud River, and Silver River are all other names for this Milky Way. Every autumn, when the sky is high and clear, the position of the Milky Way in the sky is most obvious. Those who follow Confucius's teaching of "What is beyond the six directions, reserve judgment" are unwilling to carefully observe celestial phenomena, and thus think that the Milky Way can only be seen in autumn, and also give it the nickname "Autumn River." But don't they know that the "Cloud Han" chapter of the Book of Songs already has the saying "Vast is the Cloud River, shining and turning in the sky"? It is already known that the Milky Way rotates with the sky. Therefore, the line "The Milky Way flows radiantly from ancient times to the present" is most appropriate for describing autumn. However, it cannot be said to violate the facts if applied to other seasons. Only "The Dipper's handle points southwest, densely and clearly" is a unique celestial phenomenon of autumn nights, and cannot be easily borrowed. The Big Dipper is the most eye-catching constellation in the northern celestial sphere, and everyone must have recognized it long ago. However, it is not easy to find it in the first half of the night in autumn. This is because at this time, the Big Dipper itself has already fallen to the northern horizon. Only the three stars of the Dipper's handle remain, standing upside down like a tail, pointing precisely towards the southwest. Although Fangweng was concerned about his country and its people, he lived a life of a rustic old man in the Jianghu, and had close contact with nature until he was over ninety years old. There are many places in his poems where he quotes celestial phenomena, and they mostly correspond to the facts.</p>
<p>When the Big Dipper in autumn night falls to the horizon, the people of southern China cannot see the Big Dipper temporarily. However, the people of the north can still see its upper part above the horizon. When we can see the body of the Big Dipper, we can mentally extend a straight line upwards from the two stars that are farthest away from the handle of the Dipper. When this line extends to about five times the distance between the two stars, we can encounter a brighter star. The intensity of this star's light is similar to that of the stars of the Big Dipper. And its position is quite different from others. If you have the patience to observe the sky for one or two hours, you can see the Big Dipper and all the other stars slowly rotating around this star. In fact, this is the "North Star" mentioned in the Analects, "Governing with virtue is like the North Star, abiding in its place, and all the stars orbit around it." It is also the "Cardinal Pole" in Li Yuan's "Treatise on Destiny," "The heavens move and the stars revolve, but the Cardinal Pole remains in its place." According to our country's previous division of the stars in the sky into constellations and twenty-eight mansions, the stars near the North Pole are called the Purple Palace Enclosure. There are many examples of stars named after official titles in the Purple Palace Enclosure. The North Star just mentioned is called the Jade Emperor. Perhaps some people dislike the feudal color of this name, which is too strong. But from its majestic and immovable position controlling the entire sky, it can be said to be worthy of the name. When we come to find the North Star, we use the two stars in the Big Dipper as tools. Therefore, these two stars can also be given the beautiful name of "Pointer Stars."</p>
<p>On the other side of the North Star, in the area directly opposite the Big Dipper, there are five or six relatively bright stars. If these stars are connected in order, they can form the shape of the English letter W. Its upper end faces the North Star. These stars are the so-called Cassiopeia constellation. Its position is right where the Milky Way passes through. Below the W shape is a string of four bright stars. Although the distance between each star is very far, the separation between them is quite uniform. Looking at it, it seems that a few small electric lights are sparsely dotted on the line of a kite. These stars belong to the Andromeda constellation. The lowest star in this string is actually a cross-party member. Because it and the other three stars to the south form an almost equilateral square, it gets the title of the Pegasus constellation's square.</p>
<p>There are very many stars that we can see in autumn. If we talk about them one by one like this, not only will the speaker not be able to finish, but the listener will also feel bored. Therefore, I will now only talk about the two stars that are indispensable in the "Idle Chat About Autumn Stars" chapter, and put the rest aside for the time being. We only need to know a few main lines to recognize roads, and then it will not be difficult to find other roads with a little guidance. Is it not the same with recognizing constellations? Of course, we cannot do "Idle Chat About Autumn Stars" without mentioning the Cowherd and Weaver Girl. The legend of the Golden Wind and Jade Dew, the magpie bridge crossing, is probably known to everyone. However, the number of people who have had a face-to-face encounter with the protagonists of this story is probably limited. Why don't we just introduce them to everyone? The Milky Way in autumn night flows from the northeast corner of the sky to the southwest corner. Looking up at the two brightest stars on either side of the Milky Way in the middle of the sky, there is no doubt that they are the Cowherd and Weaver Girl we are looking for. The Weaver Girl star is in the northwest of the Milky Way. Together with the five other stars with slightly weaker light, it forms a neat geometric shape. This shape is formed by connecting an equilateral triangle and an oblique square (or parallelogram) at two corners. The Cowherd is located on the southeast bank of the Milky Way. Not far from the Cowherd's north and south sides, there is a star on each side, with less brilliance than the Cowherd, like the two children carried on the Cowherd's shoulders.</p>
<p>If you happen to meet someone and learn their name after being introduced, then you can never call them your close friend. Therefore, being able to name the stars and understanding the situation of the stars are two completely different things. We actually know a lot about strangers whose names we don't know, because at least they are a person with a round head and square feet, possessing life and spirit. As for the stars in the sky, even if we can point out that this is the Cowherd and that is the Weaver Girl, we still don't understand what these shimmering things that are arranged across the sky are. However, people's ability to spread rumors is not small. The less they know, the more they will fabricate stories. Everyone must have heard the legend that the Cowherd and Weaver Girl meet once a year on the Qixi Festival. Liu Xiang's "Filial Piety Picture" also has a story about the Weaver Girl marrying the filial son Dong Yong. It says that during the Former Han Dynasty, Gai Yong sold himself to bury his father. The Weaver Girl married him and went to the new master's house, weaving a thousand bolts of silk within ten days to redeem himself. Although rewarding filial piety is a good thing, doing it like this would make the Cowherd too embarrassed. The names Milky River, Heavenly River, and Star River are always inseparable from the word "river." Rivers communicate with the sea, so it is associated with someone floating on a raft to the sea's shore in August, and after a year arriving in a city, seeing someone drinking cattle by the river, and also seeing weavers in the palace. The most miraculous thing is that the day this person arrived at the Heavenly River, people could see the phenomenon of each star violating the Ox constellation in the human world. We know that the foreign name for the Milky Way can be directly translated as "Milky Road." Naturally, they can have another kind of associated legend by interpreting the words literally. If you enter the National Art Gallery in London, you can see a large oil painting depicting a woman breastfeeding a baby. Carelessly, her breast and nipple left the baby's small mouth, and a stream of milk spurted out like a fountain. The title of this painting is "The Origin of the Milky Way." Although the name Milky Way inevitably has a bit of a commercial atmosphere, calling it Milky Road is a bit too drool-inducing.</p>
<p>The Big Dipper is called Dipper in English. Its meaning is the same as "Dipper", which is a large spoon. The Germans usually call the Big Dipper "dergossenwagen". The Book of Northern Qi contains a story about the high monk Yi Xing, saying that in order to save a benefactor who had committed a crime, he used a spell to make the Big Dipper disappear, and then memorialized Emperor Yuan, saying, "The Emperor's chariot is not seen, which has never happened in ancient times. If your minister's humble opinion is correct, there is nothing better than a general amnesty." From this, it can be seen that the Big Dipper was also called the Emperor's Chariot in ancient times. Isn't it the same as the German name and the English name "Hearles Wagon", with a wonderful sense of matching? The Big Dipper controls the mythology of human longevity and virtue, which is probably based on the story in "Records of Searching for the Supernatural" where Guan Lu taught Zhao Yan to ask the Southern and Northern Dippers, who were playing chess, to increase his age from nineteen to ninety. Because of the reprint in "Romance of the Three Kingdoms", it received great publicity effect. Therefore, almost everyone knows this Big Dipper story. The Big Dipper's Greek name is the Great Bear constellation. The position of the North Star is at the tail end of their Little Bear constellation's tail. Greek mythology about these Large and Small Bear constellations is based on a story of beautiful eyebrows and rumors. It is said that the Queen of Heaven, feeling jealous because the mermaids were exceptionally enchanting, wanted to harm her. The Heavenly God used his power to transform the mermaid into a large black bear in the deep mountains. However, her son, while hunting, of course did not expect that this black bear was his own mother, and was about to draw an arrow to shoot it. The Heavenly God quickly turned this mother and son into the Large and Small Bear constellations in the sky. The tragedy of human ethics was avoided invisibly. However, the Queen of Heaven was unwilling to give up, and sent people to chase after them. It is said that the reason why the stars in the northern sky run all day like a revolving lantern, never stopping day and night, rotating around the North Pole, is due to the phenomenon caused by chasing the Large and Small Bears.</p>
<p>The southernmost of the string of four bright stars in the Andromeda constellation is a cross-party member, as mentioned above. The northernmost star actually belongs to another Perseus constellation. The mythology related to these constellations also originated from the struggle between women for beauty, which is somewhat similar to the structure of the Big Dipper mythology. It is said that Andromeda was the pearl of Cassiopeia, and thought that her beauty was not something that the sea goddesses could hope to match. Neptune was enraged by this, and caused great disturbance. Cassiopeia was at a loss, and had no choice but to sacrifice Andromeda, tying him to a desolate island on the edge of the sea to appease Neptune's anger. When the sea monster came to the island to punish Andromeda, Perseus, who had just subdued a demon king, passed by the island riding a winged horse, holding the demon's head. So he showed the demon's head to the sea monster, making him as stiff as a stone. Andromeda met his savior. This winged horse also had a connection with poets. It is said that the winged horse's hoofs stepping on the ground can make springs gush straight out. Therefore, he also has the effect of making poets' beautiful writing spring up and thoughts soar.</p>
<p>These legends, you might as well say them and I might as well listen to them, it doesn't hurt. Although he may not give us the knowledge of the stars, at least he can arouse interest in watching autumn stars. As for the discussion of questions such as how far the stars are from us, how fast they move, etc., it is inevitable that it will be a bit scientific, and it does not fit the style of idle talk, so this article will be put aside for the time being.</p>

<h3>Yin Mingde and Others Depart for Yunnan to Survey and Demarcate the Border; Attend Welcome Meeting Held by Various Circles in Yunnan Before Departure; The Meeting Suggests Six Points to Strive For</h3>
<p>Kunming The Yunnan Public Diplomacy Support Association convened representatives of various groups on the evening of the 29th at the Provincial Party Headquarters to hold a welcome meeting for the border survey committee. After Yin Mingde arrived, he reported on a brief history of the Yunnan-Burma border affairs. Finally, the meeting put forward six points of opinions from the Yunnan people on the border survey, requesting Commissioner Yin to strive for them to the death, and the entire people pledged to be his backing. (1) For the undetermined section of the southern border, our side should strive to take the Nu River as the natural boundary, because the Mengmi and Mubang Tusi (local chieftain) west of the Nu River used to belong to our side, and should not be conceded again. (2) It should be advocated that the future Yunnan-Burma boundary line should start from the place where the Nanmen River flows into the Jiuyi River, and go down along the river to the place where the Nanban River flows into the Nu River. (3) Our side should advocate overturning the five-color line and abandoning past disputed documents. The conversation between the former British envoy Jiatgan and our Foreign Minister Wang slightly contains this proposal. (4) The British side should be required to automatically remove all military, political, and transportation facilities in the Nu River area, so that the committee can smoothly survey along the east bank of the Nu River. (5) It is hoped that our commissioners will thoroughly investigate all the territories, important villages, latitudes and longitudes, major river basins and watershed shapes, latitudes and longitudes, and important locations east of the Nu River, according to their historical, geographical, and political relations, and compile a clear list as the basis for future border agreement negotiations. (6) It is hoped that our commissioners will incidentally investigate the Pan Hong incident that occurred in December of the 22nd year of the Republic of China, and all our losses, as the basis for negotiations on compensation. The survey commissioners Yin Mingde, geological and ethnic investigators Ling Chunsheng and Meng Xianmin, and more than 40 survey personnel, departed from Kunming at 10 a.m. this morning to Husu in the appointed area. Luggage, equipment, etc., have been hired since the 28th, and more than 200 horses have been transported in advance. (October 30th, Central News Agency)</p>

<h3>Salt River Water Level Drops Sharply; Water Divides into Two Streams into the Sea</h3>
<p>(Xuzhou) The Guanyun Salt River was oppressed by the Yellow River flow, and the dam on the west bank had already collapsed, and the west side of Guanyun had already reported land subsidence. A part of the dam on the east bank collapsed. Last night, the five Guantuo River mouths of Guanyun's Post-Disaster Relief River and the Tongsheng Salt River were suddenly washed away, and the embankment collapsed. The Salt River water flowed southeast, divided into two streams into the sea, so the Salt River water level dropped suddenly. Although Guanyun County was besieged, people's hearts were slightly at peace. (October 31st, Central News Agency)</p>

<h3>Legislative Yuan Passes Disaster Relief Bond Regulations</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Legislative Yuan held its 36th meeting on the afternoon of the 31st to discuss matters: (1) The Police Officer Appointment Law was passed. (2) Amendments to the Trademark Law were passed. (3) The bill on this year's flood disaster relief public bonds and the principal and interest repayment schedule was passed with amendments. (October 31st, Central News Agency)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the issuance of 20 million yuan of this year's flood disaster relief public bonds, the Central Government submitted it to the Legislative Yuan for review on the 30th, which was approved by Sun Ke and submitted to the Finance Committee. The review was completed immediately and submitted to the meeting for approval on the 31st. The Finance Committee's review concluded that the provision stipulated by the Central Political Committee that a portion of this public bond may be matched with civil servants' salaries is an administrative procedure and does not need to be stipulated in the regulations. After the case was passed, the Legislative Yuan has submitted it to the National Government for promulgation so that it can be officially issued on the 1st. According to the Ministry of Finance, the issuance period of this public bond is still set for November 1st, but the actual issuance procedures need to be delayed for a few days due to unpreparedness. If there is an urgent need for flood disaster relief at present, the Ministry of Finance has printed subscription warrants for this public bond, which can be used as collateral at any time, and then exchanged for formal face values in the future. Since the Central Government has decided that a portion of this public bond may be matched with civil servants' salaries, it should be followed. The proportion and duration of the match are being discussed. (October 31st, Central News Agency)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The text of the "Regulations on the Flood Disaster Relief Public Bonds of the Republic of China, 1935" passed by the Legislative Yuan on the 31st is as follows: (1) The National Government, in order to provide relief for flood disasters and carry out construction work, issues public bonds, named "Flood Disaster Relief Public Bonds of the Republic of China, 1935." (2) The fixed amount of this public bond is 20 million yuan in national currency. (3) The public bond is scheduled to be issued on November 1st, 1935, at 98% of its face value. (4) The interest rate of this public bond is set at 6% per annum, and interest is paid twice a year at the end of April and October. (5) The repayment period of this public bond is set at twelve years. From the date of issuance, interest is paid only for the first five years. From the sixth year, the principal is repaid in seven years. The principal is repaid twice a year at the end of April and October. The first to twelfth repayments each account for 7% of the total amount, and the thirteenth and fourteenth repayments each account for 8% of the total amount. By October 31st, 1947, the full amount will be repaid. The aforementioned repayment of principal will be carried out by lottery. (6) The fund for paying the interest on this public bond will be allocated from the disaster relief reserve fund deposited in the national treasury. The principal fund to be repaid in seven years will be allocated from the newly added customs duties. The Ministry of Finance will order the National Treasury and the Director-General of Customs to allocate the amount of principal and interest to be repaid monthly to the account of the National Debt Fund Management Committee according to the principal and interest repayment schedule, for exclusive storage and payment. (7) The face values of this public bond are divided into three types: ten yuan, one hundred yuan, and one thousand yuan, all of which are unregistered. (8) The Central Bank is designated as the agency for managing the repayment of principal and interest of this public bond. (9) This public bond can be freely bought, sold, and mortgaged. When guarantee money must be paid for official business, it can be used as a substitute, and it can also be used as a guarantee reserve for banks.

<h3>Songjiang: Fugitive Bandit Arrested in Songjiang</h3>
<p>The Jinzhu area of the fourth district of She County, Anhui Province, was previously burned, killed, and looted by bandits, leaving the people uneasy. After the county police and defense forces suppressed them, more than twenty bandits, including Fang Renfang, were captured. Fang Bingliang, a victim from the countryside, filed a lawsuit for the murder of his father and brother by the bandits. The captured bandits have all been sentenced to imprisonment. However, not many days later, there were second bandit disturbances. As a result of the suppression, bandits such as Wu He were killed on the spot, and the remaining bandits fled elsewhere. Recently, the county government reported that fugitive bandits were hiding in Songjiang, and requested the county to arrest them. At six o'clock in the morning on the 31st, the Director of Public Security ordered Chief Inspector Lang and inspectors to lead police officers to a small carpentry shop at No. 2 Liyuan Lane in the second 保 (bao) of Fengle Town. The bandits were sleeping soundly and were captured in one fell swoop. Six bandits, including Wu Chenggui, Wu Chengyue, Wu Changshou, Hong Heitie, and Wu Afu, were apprehended and taken back for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Suzhou: Commissioner Re-Investigates Stone Pagoda Incident</h3>
<p>The detective team of the Wuyi Public Security Bureau was ordered to go to Shizhuang, Jiangyin, to arrest the notorious bandit Peng Shengrong, which caused a dispute and a murder case.

<h3>Humble Suggestions on Salt Administration Reform</h3>
<p>— Li Youyi</p>
<p>In ancient times, the benefits of mountains and seas were not subject to monopolies. Guan Zhong created the theory of official mountains and government seas, and monopolies began to extend to salt. The most notable figure in salt administration throughout the dynasties was Liu Yan of the Tang Dynasty, whose method of allowing civilians to produce, officials to collect, and merchants to transport was praised for a time. Indeed, edible salt is a necessity for human life, and its relation to the people's livelihood is more important than rice and wheat. Rice and wheat can be planted anywhere, while salt is limited to coastal areas for production. Although there are well salt, pond salt, mineral salt, and earth salt produced in Sichuan, Gansu, Yunnan, Shanxi, Xinjiang, Mongolia, Tibet, and Xikang, the quantity is not abundant and only meets local needs. The remaining provinces all depend on coastal production. In areas far from the production areas, roads are dangerous and transportation is difficult, and merchants are often unwilling to transport salt there. The old system divided the areas for transporting the salt and stipulated salt trading areas to prevent remote areas from lacking salt, and the original intention was not bad. However, since the early Qing Dynasty, the established laws have been poor, the systems in various regions are different, and the regulations are extremely complex. Within the monopoly areas, merchants are granted great rights and interests, and they are completely responsible for collection, transportation, and sales, which allows those with huge amounts of capital to monopolize the trade. On the one hand, they purchase edible salt produced by the blood and sweat of salt farmers in the production areas at the lowest prices. On the other hand, they seek huge profits, seizing the money earned by farmers and poor laborers in the interior through their blood and sweat. This has resulted in a people-harming monetary policy in our country for hundreds of years, which is not tolerated by public opinion. If this malady is not eradicated, it will hinder the principle of people's livelihood, which is not a minor matter. In terms of production areas, the coastal areas are barren, and salt farmers rely solely on salt production for their livelihoods. However, the price of salt collected in various regions is far from the price of salt sold. Salt farmers work hard all day long but cannot get enough to eat. In terms of sales areas, the farmers and poor laborers consume the most salt per day. These people have no delicacies to eat, and their meals rely on adding salt. The high price of salt can greatly increase their burden on life. Given these two major problems, salt administration reform must be considered an urgent task. The government, recognizing this, resolutely promulgated the New Salt Law in the 20th year of the Republic of China, intending to reform the salt administration in order to relieve the people's livelihood. However, due to the difficulty of removing entrenched malpractices, the New Salt Law has not yet been implemented after five years. The reasons for the obstruction are roughly as follows:</p>
<p>(A) The tax rate stipulated in the New Salt Law is five yuan per 100 kilograms of salt, exempting all surcharges, regardless of heavy or light areas, which is lighter than the old tax. After implementation, the revenue may not be as high as before (To be continued)</p>

<h3>The Importance and Implementation Methods of Controlling Stem Borers in Rice-Producing Areas</h3>
<p>— Xu Shuojun</p>
<p>This year, stem borer damage is widespread in rice-producing areas of our country, especially in southern Jiangsu. Now is winter. It is essential to implement stem borer control in the affected counties. This article is the transcript of a lecture by Mr. Xu Shuojun of the Natural Science Society at the Central Broadcasting Wireless Station. Mr. Xu has worked on stem borer control in Zhejiang Province for many years and is currently employed at the Central Cotton Production Improvement Institute, researching insect pests. What he said is very accurate and can provide a reference for county governments in rice-producing areas to implement stem borer control.</p>
<p>Although it is winter now, and the stem borers have disappeared, the terrible scenes of past stem borer disasters are still vividly in our minds. We must not think that they are all dead; they are still there, preparing to cause harm next year. We must know this.</p>
<p>Stem borers are our great enemies. Stem borers have many other names: heart-drilling worms, floating worms, white moths, and water maggots. When stem borers cause damage, people do not know it at first. By the time white ears appear, there is no way to deal with it. Farmers in Jiangning County say, "Locusts can be beaten, knot worms can be combed, but there is no cure for heart-drilling worms." Therefore, everyone believes that stem borers are like human tuberculosis; once it occurs, it is over. In the 18th year of the Republic of China, the stem borer disaster in Zhejiang Province caused a loss of 20 million yuan. That year, rice prices soared, farmers lived off the wealthy households, rice shops were robbed, people were panicked, and the area was not peaceful. In the western part of Zhejiang, farmers turned pale at the mention of stem borers and dared not grow rice. Chairman Jiang sent a telegram from the front to the Zhejiang Provincial Government to allocate 12,000 yuan specifically for winter stem borer control, which shows how serious the situation was at that time. In the past two years, the stem borer disaster has intensified again. Last year, Jiangning County alone lost 5 million yuan, and this year it has not decreased slightly. Jiangning, Zhenjiang, Wuxi, Wujiang, Jiangyin suffered losses of 80% to 100%. In Jiangyin County, because the fields were full of white ears and there was no food, some people even threw their daughters into the river (see the Nanjing China Daily). Other places such as Chongming, Qidong, Jiangpu, Jurong, Changshu, and northern Jiaxing are also very serious. We know that stem borers are found in all rice-producing areas. According to Mr. Cai Banghua's estimate, our stem borer disaster causes a loss of at least 18 million yuan per year, and when it is severe, it can reach 20 million yuan. This is truly an unimaginable number. Stem borers are stealing our rice, so we must treat them as great enemies and absolutely not underestimate them. Let us look at</p>
<p>the ingenious life of the stem borer, and we will know even more. Scientifically speaking, there are three types of stem borers: three-generation stem borers, two-generation stem borers, and large stem borers. The three-generation stem borer is the most harmful, and their lifestyles are generally similar. Let us take the three-generation stem borer as an example: its life cycle is the same as that of a silkworm; it transforms from an egg into a larva (equal to a silkworm), sheds its skin five times, becomes a pupa, and then transforms into a moth after six or seven days. The moth then lays eggs, which is another generation of stem borers. This cycle repeats itself, occurring three times each year. Humans do not have grandchildren until they are forty years old at the earliest, and usually fifty or sixty years old. If it takes hundreds of years to complete three generations, the stem borer can do it in just one year. The development of stem borer offspring coincides with the seedling and growth stages of early, middle, and late rice, so rice is harmed at all times during its growing period.</p>
<p>Furthermore, they are well protected. Most of their lives are spent living inside the rice stalks. Natural enemies such as frogs, spiders, and dragonflies cannot easily harm them. Now that the rice has been harvested, everyone thinks that the stem borers are all dead, but in reality, they have other ways and places to overwinter. If we peel open the rice roots, there is a layer of cocoon inside. The larva hides inside to overwinter. Because the weather is getting colder and the rice is almost ripe, it feels that the weather is unsuitable and there is no food. It crawls to the last section of the rice root to make a cocoon and hibernate inside. The rice root incision is filled with insect droppings, which is like a person living in a warm room with tightly closed windows.</p>
<p>These overwintering larvae transform into moths in late April and early May of the following year. They fly to the seedling fields and lay egg masses on the tips of the seedlings. Each mass contains one hundred eggs. Each moth can lay more than one hundred forty eggs in its lifetime. The total number of egg masses produced by three generations is, of course, alarming. Each person usually has two or three children, and very few have ten children. The reproductive capacity of stem borers is simply incomparable. There are yellow-brown hairs on the egg mass, which is surprisingly to cover the eggs. More than 70 million of these egg masses were found in Jiangning County. At first, the farmers did not believe it at all. This is simply a clever deception.</p>
<p>After the larvae hatch from these egg masses, they spit silk and suspend themselves, spreading in the wind and entering the stalks, causing the heart leaves of the seedlings to wither and turn yellow. In July, the first generation of moths emerges, and in August and September, the third generation of moths emerges. The egg masses of these two generations are laid on the leaves five or six inches from the tips of the rice plants. The larvae that hatch from the eggs drill into the rice stalks, unable to rise. As a result, the stalks develop the symptoms of dead heart seedlings, dead in the womb, and white ears. This year, some rice fields in Jiangning, Kunshan, Jiangyin, Wuxi, Wujin, and Suzhou (near Huqiu) in Jiangsu are almost full of white ears, which is truly heartbreaking.</p>
<p>There are many ways to prevent and control stem borers. The most important and fundamental method is to eliminate them in winter.</p>
<p>There are several effective methods for winter stem borer control:</p>
<p>(1) Thoroughly burn the rice roots. All of the three-generation stem borers overwinter in the rice roots. Most of the two-generation stem borers and large stem borers also overwinter in the rice roots. Destroying the rice roots is destroying the stem borers. The method of destroying the rice roots is to plow and harrow the rice fields uniformly. After plowing and harrowing, some of the rice roots are covered in the soil, and some are exposed on the surface of the soil. Most of the stem borers in the rice roots covered in the soil die and will not easily cause harm next year. We can ignore them. The most dangerous are the rice roots exposed on the outside. The roots contain overwintering stem borers. We must collect all of them and process them according to the following methods:</p>
<p>(A) Layer the rice roots and river mud alternately to form piles, and then seal them well with river mud. Over time, the rice roots will rot and can be used as fertilizer.</p>
<p>(B) Mix the rice roots with dry rice straw, pile them in the fields, and set them on fire to burn them.</p>
<p>(C) Dig pits to bury them, to be used as fertilizer.</p>
<p>We have suffered enough from stem borer disasters this year. To reduce stem borer damage next year, we must plow and harrow our rice fields and collect all the soil from the rice roots. We must not be negligent.</p>
<p>After our rice is harvested, some people plant beans, some plant wheat, some plant vegetables, and some plant grass seeds. For fields planted with beans, wheat, and vegetables, plowing is not a problem. However, the exposed rice roots must be collected and processed according to the above methods. Only for fields planted with grass seeds, according to common practice, the seeds are sown before the rice is harvested. The stem borers in these fields can overwinter safely in the rice, which is most dangerous. Next year, it is best to plow the soil first, clean and destroy the rice roots, and then plant the seeds. It is too late to do this this year, and the grass seeds have already been sown, but the soil has not been turned. For these grass seed fields, we must quickly use hoes to dig up all the rice roots and process them according to the above methods to be legal. Also, for all fields that are not planted with winter crops, they must also be hoed, harrowed flat, and the rice roots must be collected and burned. In short, we must absolutely not allow any unplowed fields and rice roots to exist.</p>
<p>In addition to controlling stem borers, winter plowing and destroying rice roots has many other benefits in agriculture. After winter plowing, the soil can be frozen and thawed by rain and snow, and the soil blocks are broken due to expansion and contraction. Hard soil can become loose, increasing the area for rice to absorb nutrients. Moreover, in fields that have been winter plowed, rainwater easily seeps into the soil, and fertilizer will not be lost. The roots of weeds can be cleared, and the remaining roots and leaves in the field can be turned into the soil to rot and become fertilizer. All diseases and insects will also be destroyed by winter plowing. There is an ancient saying in our country: "Farmers plow in winter, children want to be born by their own parents," which is a clear and reasonable saying. It is best to plow and harrow the fields as soon as the rice is harvested. There is a saying in Hunan: "One-seventh is gold, eight is silver, nine is copper, ten is iron" (referring to the lunar calendar). In other words, plowing in July is as effective as gold, and plowing in October is as effective as iron. The earlier the plowing, the greater the effect. However, it is still possible at this moment, and we must not delay any longer.</p>
<p>(2) Long-term irrigation. In places where the water source is convenient, if the rice fields are irrigated and submerged in winter, the stem borers will all die after fifty days, and stem borer damage can be greatly reduced next year. Because stem borers, like humans, also breathe when they hibernate in the rice roots. If the water is submerged, the stem borers will be suffocated. However, we must pay attention to the depth of the water when flooding the fields. We must completely submerge the tops of all the rice roots, otherwise the tenacious stem borers will not die. Long-term irrigation in winter also has many benefits. Simply put, irrigation can promote fertilizer dissolution, loosen the solid soil, and because the water contains a small amount of light fertilizer, irrigation can also increase the small amount of light fertilizer in the field.</p>
<p>(3) Quickly burn all the rice straw. The larvae of the two-generation stem borers are cold, and some climb into the rice roots, but some have slow reflexes and are still on the upper part of the rice stalks when it is cold. After the rice is harvested, they stay in the rice straw, so a lot of two-generation stem borers are hiding in the rice straw piles. Most rice straw piles are on the side of the house, near the seedling fields. By the end of April next year, they will climb to the outside of the rice straw pile, pupate into moths, and fly to the seedling fields to lay eggs. According to our investigation, there are still this year's rice straw stored in June and July. The more places where rice straw is burned and the more rice straw is stored, the more one-generation stem borers there will be. Therefore, in winter, we must make full use of rice straw as firewood, straw for livestock, and feed, and completely destroy it before Qingming next year, at the latest before Guyu, because at that time the stem borers have not yet pupated into moths. If the rice straw is burned, the stem borers will also be destroyed.</p>
<p>We guarantee that the above aspects are the most effective methods. This year, the three-generation stem borer is the most severe, so we must pay special attention to destroying the rice roots and irrigating the fields. In foreign countries, it is enough to tell the farmers, but in China, simply promoting it is not enough, because they have no organizational ability. As a result, the instructor is earnest, but the listeners are vague, and they will never do it in their lives. Therefore, the county government must use its political power to supervise it in order to achieve the goal of winter stem borer control. This year, the stem borer disaster is so severe that the stem borer control work in Jiangning, Zhenjiang, Wuxi, Wujiang, Jiangyin, Chongming, Qidong, Changshu, Jiangpu, and other rice-producing counties in Jiangsu should be listed as one of the important county policies in winter.</p>
<p>The implementation of winter stem borer control should pay attention to the following points: The governments of Jiangning and Kunshan counties have implemented this, and a special introduction is given:</p>
<p>The first step is to organize. The organization should have two parts: implementation and supervision:</p>
<p>Implementation section: Taking the autonomous guidance area as the unit, and the autonomous guidance staff as the stem borer control team leader, the police chiefs and the principals of the central elementary schools serve as the deputy leaders respectively. The autonomous organization supervises the township and village chiefs, and orders the farmers to implement stem borer control in accordance with the prescribed methods.</p>
<p>Supervision section: Each district is equipped with one supervisor who leads one or two policemen to the township to supervise whether the implementation section is being executed and whether it is legal. Supervisors should be stationed at the district office during the winter stem borer control period.</p>
<p>The second step is to strictly set an implementation deadline: The county government stipulates a period, which can be called the "Winter Stem Borer Control Work Period." Farmers must complete the processing within this period in accordance with the regulations, and set a period for the "Winter Stem Borer Inspection Period." If the farmers fail to implement it according to the law in the first period for some reason, the supervisors will check and punish them separately and seek remedies.</p>
<p>The first step is to earnestly popularize stem borer control knowledge: Each district should convene township chiefs, village chiefs, and autonomous committee members to hold winter stem borer training sessions separately, and lead them to the fields for practice. The township offices should also regularly convene village chiefs, ten gentry, and major business households to hold meetings to lecture on stem borer control methods and discuss implementation methods. It is best to also print and post some stem borer control illustrations or simple explanations (Note: The Central Agricultural Experiment Institute or the Zhejiang Provincial Entomology Bureau has drafted these illustrations and simple explanations, and they will be sent upon request by letter).</p>
<p>The fourth step is to strictly reward and punish those who can do it according to the law within the prescribed period, the county government should select and reward the best, including plaques, agricultural tools, and money. Farmers who still fail to implement it according to the law during the inspection period will be detained and fined by the supervisor. They will not be allowed to report disasters in the coming year, and they will not enjoy the right to other relief from the county government. Farmers who are restricted for not controlling stem borers according to the law, if the township and village chiefs issue a guarantee that they will comply within five days, they may be released at any time, but the handling should not be a fine. We must deeply know.</p>
<p>Winter stem borer control is very important because stem borers are very active at ordinary times, and the eggs are relatively small, so it is not easy to clean them all. Now they are all concentrated in the rice roots for hibernation, so they can be wiped out in one fell swoop. Furthermore, stem borer control is equal to treating diseases. It is better to talk about cleanliness and hygiene than to hire a good doctor, because if a person gets a terminal illness, even a good doctor is helpless, because there are no doctors in the world who can bring the dead back to life. Once the rice develops white ears, it cannot be cured, which is the same as a terminal illness. We must be prepared and eliminate the stem borers in winter so that they cannot cause harm next year, just like people talk about hygiene. Killing one stem borer this winter is equal to killing thousands of stem borers next year, which is a fundamental method of stem borer control.</p>
<p>Leading stem borer control is the responsibility of the government, and implementing stem borer control is the responsibility of every farmer. The most important thing is to cooperate closely and mobilize all of the people. If it is not a general mobilization, and some people do it and some people do not, then the stem borers in the fields of those who do not do it can still spread to other people's fields and cause harm. This is harming the group, and everyone should sanction him. The results of stem borer control this winter can predict next year's rice harvest. If you want stem borer damage to be reduced next year, please do not let go of this good opportunity. Everyone! Remember: "Stem borer damage is not a natural disaster and can be prevented and controlled by human power."</p>

<h3>Various Industries Safely Pass the End-of-October Crisis, Eagerly Awaiting the Effective Implementation of Acceptance Bills</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the end of October, the date when long-term credit loans for Shanghai's industrial and commercial sectors were due. The banking and money exchange industries made special accommodations for the due loans, settling interest and extending the terms. As a result, various industrial and commercial firms and companies were able to barely survive the difficulty. Various industries are preparing to promote acceptance bills. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>End of October Passed: After the banking and money exchange industries made accommodations for the long-term credit loans due at the end of October, the industrial and commercial sectors barely survived the crisis, and no unfortunate events occurred. Yesterday was the last day of October, and the banking and money exchange industries were particularly busy collecting and settling accounts. Internally, office hours were extended. As for the money exchange market, the Shanghai interbank lending rate in the morning and afternoon yesterday was still 1.7%, but with the addition of commissions, it reached a peak of 7%. The total amount exchanged at the bank clearing house was 49,667,413.44 yuan. The interest rate for government bonds was 1.9%, and the discount rate was 2.4%.</p>
<p>Acceptance Bills: Although the end-of-October crisis was barely survived, the decline in various industries remains the same as before. Various industries are hoping for the unified promotion of acceptance bills to facilitate adjustments and avoid unfortunate events during the settlement of accounts in 1935. As for the proposal to promote acceptance bills, the Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Loan Review Committee accepted the suggestion of the City Chamber of Commerce to allocate 2 million yuan from credit loans as a fund to promote acceptance bills.

<h3>Municipal Government Sends Letter to Concession Authorities, Suppressing Illegal Trading Organizations, Should Be Prosecuted by the Concession Authorities or the Victims Should File Private Lawsuits</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, recently, various illegal trading organizations in the concessions of this city have had a significant impact on prices and finance. Therefore, the Ministry of Finance consulted the Municipal Government to strictly suppress them. After investigation by the Municipal Government, there are still quite a few such illegal organizations in the concessions. Therefore, a letter was sent to the concession authorities to handle the matter according to law. The original text of the Municipal Government's letter and the addresses of various illegal trading organizations are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Municipal Government Letter: To whom it may concern: This government has now received a consultation from the Ministry of Finance, stating that those who establish exchanges or markets similar to exchanges without approval and registration, or brokers who act as agents, intermediaries, or convey orders for buying and selling on exchanges without approval, or those who engage in trading outside of exchanges based on exchange market prices, speculating on gains and losses, are subject to the clearly stipulated penalties in the revised articles of the Exchange Law. In Shanghai concessions, various illegal trading organizations have been suppressed by the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau in accordance with the law, but they still have not complied. According to Article 5 of the Agreement on Chinese Courts in the Shanghai International Settlement, for cases other than those governed by Articles 103 to 186 of the old Criminal Code, such as violations of the Exchange Law occurring within the jurisdiction of that special district court, the prosecution should be initiated by the concession administrative authorities, or a private lawsuit should be filed by the victims. Currently, the head office believes that the illegal gold standard trading organizations in Shanghai concessions, in addition to private lawsuits filed by the victims, should be prosecuted by the concession administrative authorities in accordance with Chinese law in order to suppress them and avoid disrupting the market, etc., and a list is attached to your government. Gold standard trading is closely related to finance, and illegal operations should not be allowed to manipulate and disrupt it. In response to the previous consultation, the original list is copied and sent, requesting you to investigate and handle it according to law, and hoping to receive a reply. Sincerely, Shanghai Public Concession Council, attached is a copy of the list, Secretariat of the Shanghai Municipal Government.</p>

<h3>Voluntary Registration of Smokers Ended Yesterday, Compulsory Registration Starts Today</h3>
<p>Show Mercy to Ignorant People Who Surrender, Avoid Punishment, Those Who Fail to Register and Are Caught Will Be Strictly Punished</p>
<p>The Municipal Public Security Bureau's voluntary registration of smokers ended yesterday. Approximately 1,000 people registered yesterday, bringing the total number of registered smokers, including the previous 18,199, to more than 19,000. The registration has been quite effective. Compulsory registration starts today and will continue until the end of this year. During this compulsory period, if smokers who have been missed realize their mistakes, surrender to the bureau and apply for registration, the Public Security Bureau will exercise leniency and, with the approval of the Municipal Government, exempt them from fines and register them in accordance with the regulations. If they delay and remain hesitant, failing to surrender and register, they will be arrested as soon as they are discovered by officers of the Public Security Bureau, fined in accordance with the regulations, and then ordered to register. No leniency will be granted. The bureau's proclamation and early report are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Proclamation</p>
<p>The Public Security Bureau's proclamation states: Since this bureau began handling the registration of smokers, it has repeatedly ordered its subordinates to persuade households and widely disseminate the official announcement. Smokers have been actively coming forward to register voluntarily. Now, the voluntary registration period ends at the end of October. Compulsory registration begins on November 1st. All smokers who have been missed have been repeatedly persuaded but still refuse to comply, stubbornly violating the prohibition. Once strictly investigated and arrested, they should be fined between 50 and 300 yuan in accordance with Article 4 of the regulations on the registration of smokers, and then ordered to register. However, these people who have been repeatedly warned but remain oblivious are hateful in their obstinacy and pitiable in their ignorance. The bureau chief is showing leniency and has specially presented a request to the Municipal Government, instruction No. 3380, which has been approved, that during this compulsory registration period, if any smokers who have been missed voluntarily come to this bureau to apply for registration, showing some sign of repentance, this bureau will still show leniency, exempt them from fines, and allow them to register in accordance with the regulations, to show generosity. Those who are discovered and brought to the bureau by officers of this bureau will be fined and ordered to register in accordance with the regulations, and will not be able to seek leniency. All of you smokers who have not yet registered should be aware of the strictness of the law and the urgency of the situation, deeply realize your mistakes, and quickly come to this bureau to apply for registration voluntarily, to avoid falling into the net of the law. If you delay any further and are discovered, the law will be enforced, and there will be no room for leniency. In addition to dispatching officers to conduct strict inspections everywhere, this is a sincere warning, which you must all strictly obey. This proclamation. (Xin Sheng News Agency)</p>
<p>Report</p>
<p>The Municipal Public Security Bureau reported to the Municipal Government meeting yesterday on the progress of handling smoker registration and the future work plan, stating: The progress of this bureau in handling smoker registration has been repeatedly reported. Now, the voluntary registration period ends at the end of October. Recently, this bureau has intensified its investigation and persuasion efforts, dispatching 14 section members and investigators, and drawing 1 police squadron, to conduct investigations and persuasion in various districts. A simplified method of registration and smoking cessation for the poor has also been drafted, allowing them to be exempted from being sent to a rehabilitation center and instead have their fingerprints recorded. As a result, the number of registrants has been extremely active. In just four or five days, the Lao Beimen Police Station alone registered more than 5,000 smokers, with a majority applying for treatment. Compulsory registration begins on November 1st, and the work will be complex and varied. Matters concerning the punishment of arrested smokers and sending them to rehabilitation centers should be planned in advance to avoid obstacles. Although the majority of smokers residing in this city have registered in accordance with the regulations, there are inevitably some who have been missed. To ensure the universality of registration, the Municipal Government has approved that, during the compulsory registration period, smokers who have been missed and voluntarily come to apply for registration may be exempted from fines, to show generosity. Orders have been issued to all subordinates to comply, and 5,000 copies of the proclamation have been printed and posted everywhere. As for sending arrested smokers to rehabilitation centers, the smoking cessation hospitals in both northern and southern Shanghai can only accommodate 20 to 30 people per day. More than 1,500 people who quit smoking during the voluntary registration period have not yet been sent to rehabilitation. During the compulsory registration period, arrest work will be carried out, and the number of smokers arrested will inevitably be large. A temporary hospital should be built that can accommodate 500 smokers. This suggestion has also been reported to the Municipal Government, which has ordered immediate consultation with the Health Bureau to plan it. In order to increase efficiency and reduce the suffering of smokers, this bureau has ordered all subordinates to send cases involving arrested smokers to the bureau within three hours during this compulsory registration period, without delay. The entire staff of the Smoker Registration Section has been ordered to work in shifts, day and night, to handle all cases sent and complete them daily, without backlog. This is the most recent situation of this bureau's handling of smoker registration. (Da Gong News Agency)</p>
<h3>Shanghai Prevention of Cholera</h3>
<p>Temporary Office Proclamation No. 3</p>
<p>(1) It has been three months since the issuance of Proclamation No. 2 on July 29th. The reason for the delay in this proclamation is that I attended the Second Pacific International Health Conference in Sydney, Australia, from September 1st to 7th, which caused this delay. This opportunity to observe the health conditions in various places along the Pacific Ocean was very surprising. Common epidemics such as smallpox, plague, and cholera are still major problems in China and India, while they have been eradicated there. For example, in the densely populated (70 million residents) Netherlands East Indies, all epidemics such as smallpox and cholera have been almost completely eradicated by the Dutch authorities. Such success is realized only through the sincere cooperation of medical and non-medical personnel with local leaders and the public.</p>
<p>(2) Australia is vast, almost equal in size to China, but its population is only 6.5 million, while our country has 450 million. The mortality rate there is only 8 to 9 per thousand people, while in our country it is 20 to 25. Because there are no major infectious diseases there, the medical authorities are focusing on the prevention of influenza and dietary diseases.</p>
<p>(3) In terms of cholera, 1935 can be said to be one of the most peaceful years, as no port in China has been found to have genuine cholera. Within Shanghai, even suspected cases have been examined and proven to be non-genuine. Whether this good phenomenon is entirely due to the efforts of the Soviet concession authorities to promote universal anti-epidemic vaccination is difficult to say at this time. Cities that have not implemented anti-cholera vaccination have also fortunately been spared. But it must be noted that Shanghai is a distribution center. If no epidemic is found in this city, then we can also hope that other places will not be affected.</p>
<p>(4) The prevention of cholera is very simple. The main points are as follows: A. There must be an inexpensive and easily accessible supply of clean water; B. Healthy living conditions, especially for the poor; C. Systematic universal anti-cholera vaccination; D. Implementing public health education in homes, schools, factories, and other similar groups; E. Establishing well-equipped epidemic hospitals, capable of providing treatment at any time, especially saline injections.</p>
<p>(5) Providing an inexpensive and sufficient supply of drinking water for the poor is, in my opinion, the most important measure. Although many improvements have been made in this regard in the past five years, the cost of tap water is still too high for the poor who need it most. The act of providing free water has been implemented at fixed times during the day, but the amount is limited, and those in urgent need are often unable to obtain it easily. More equipment should be provided to make it easier for people to obtain large quantities of clean water. The method used in the Malay Archipelago is very commendable. The tap water supply on the island is managed by the municipal government, and there are many faucets in the streets providing free water, so that the poor can have water not only for drinking, but also for bathing and washing. Now, let me give another example: Geda, north of Penang, was once a place where cholera was rampant, but since the installation of tap water 25 years ago, the epidemic has completely disappeared.</p>
<p>(6) I recently visited Java and Bandung, and learned of a new method for preventing and controlling plague, which is to use live, non-toxic plague bacilli as a vaccine to resist腺陪斯忒. Since January of this year, 1.5 million people have been vaccinated using this method, and the number of plague cases has been greatly reduced, and the mortality rate of patients has also been lowered. However, the rat-proof construction of local bamboo houses also contributed to the realization of this effect. It is not impossible to try to manufacture a stronger vaccine using non-toxic, live cholera vibrios, following the aforementioned new method.</p>
<p>(7) Shanghai's anti-cholera vaccination this year ended in September, with a total of 767,725 people vaccinated, slightly more than last year. The annual statistics from 1930 to the present are listed below for comparison.</p>

<h3>Hu Wenhu Advocates Organizing Industrial and Commercial Groups</h3>
<p>Mayor Wu Expresses Approval</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, Mr. Hu Wenhu, a leader of overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia, donated funds and led more than 150 Malaysian and Chinese athletes to return to the country to participate in the Sixth National Games held in Shanghai. His patriotic enthusiasm is deeply admired. During the National Games, Mr. Hu visited the sports venues every day to watch various competitions, and told reporters from the Central News Agency that compatriots at home and abroad should interact and organize powerful industrial and commercial groups to promote the development of industry and commerce, guide returning overseas Chinese, and provide them with concrete protection. People from all walks of life have paid attention to his remarks. The reporter met Mayor Wu yesterday and asked for his opinion on Mr. Hu Wenhu's recent remarks about organizing industrial and commercial groups. He replied briefly that Mr. Hu's enthusiasm for charity and public welfare is well known to the Chinese people. Leading more than 100 overseas Chinese athletes to participate in the National Games has added a lot of luster to this National Games. He believes that organizing industrial and commercial groups, interacting with overseas countries, promoting the development of industry and commerce, guiding returning overseas Chinese, and providing them with protection, are all very important matters that the government and the people should strive to achieve.</p>
<h3>Municipal Chamber of Commerce Explains the Differences Between Three Types of Bills</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, in order to explain the difference between bills for urging payment of arrears, bills for verifying monthly accounts, and bills used as the basis for payment, replied to the Ningbo Tiansheng Photography Studio, saying: We received your letter of the 30th of this month, along with a sample bill, all of which we have noted. Our reply is as follows: (1) Article 16, Clause 1 of the Stamp Tax Law pertains to invoices, Clause 2 pertains to receipts for money and goods, and Clause 3 pertains to bills. Each has its own independent function and should be stamped separately. As mentioned in your letter, the invoices and receipts have already been stamped, and the monthly bill does not need to be stamped. If this is the case, why is there a separate item for bills in Clause 3 of Article 16? The tax law does not have any superfluous provisions, so your view is not accurate. (2) According to the Stamp Tax Law, bills are divided into three types: one is a bill for urging payment of arrears, the second is a bill for verifying accounts, both of which are stipulated in Clause 8 of Article 3 of the Stamp Tax Law, and the third is a bill used as the basis for payment, which is stipulated in Clause 3 of Article 16 of the Stamp Tax Law. Your letter refers to the monthly bill as being both a bill for urging payment and a bill for verifying accounts. If so, then what kind of bill is the bill mentioned in Clause 3 of Article 16 of the Stamp Tax Law? Therefore, this matter should be based on Article 5 of the Detailed Rules for the Implementation of the Stamp Tax Law, which was ordered by the Ministry, as the standard for explaining the three types of bills. The explanation is as follows: When merchants and customers trade goods and do not use cash, but agree to pay at the end of the month, whether large or small, a detailed bill is issued near the end of the month as the basis for payment when it is due. This is the bill mentioned in Clause 3 of Article 16 of the Stamp Tax Law, which is used as the basis for payment. Since it is agreed that payment will be made when due, if the customer pays in full when due, it cannot be said that they are in arrears. The bill issued by the store at the end of the month is only a notification to remind them to prepare in advance. Therefore, many merchants even call this bill a "notification," which is enough to show that it is different from urging payment and cannot be called urging payment of arrears. Therefore, your letter calling this bill a bill for urging payment of arrears is not in line with the provisions of Article 5 of the Detailed Rules. If the payment is not made after the bill is sent out and is delayed until the next month or the next period, and then urged again, it is naturally a matter of urging payment of arrears. Since a detailed bill has already been issued in the previous period, only a summary of the balance can be issued thereafter. Article 5 of the Detailed Rules uses whether or not the quantity and price of the goods are specified as the distinction between a bill and a bill for urging payment of arrears, and the meaning lies in this. Your letter points out that the words "error needing to be checked" on the bill mean that it is a bill for verifying accounts, but this is also not accurate. Since the bill issued at the end of the month is a preparation for the customer to make payment, how can there be payment without checking the accounts? Therefore, the distinction between these two types of bills should be based on their main purpose: is it for payment or for verifying accounts? If the main purpose is for payment, then checking the accounts is only a procedure that should be followed when making payment, and the main purpose of payment cannot be ignored, and it cannot be simply regarded as being used for verifying accounts. The purpose of the monthly bill is to remind the customer to prepare for payment, not to verify accounts. Therefore, your letter referring to this as a bill for verifying accounts is also wrong. If some of the previous account has been paid and the rest is agreed to be paid at the end of next year, then the statements issued every month or every period thereafter, indicating the amount already paid and the amount still owed, can be regarded as being used for verifying accounts. However, the sample attached to your letter does not belong to this category.</p>
<h3>City Health Director Li Ting'an to Go Abroad for Investigation</h3>
<p>Li Ting'an, Director of the Municipal Health Bureau, is a leading expert in public health in China. Recently, at the invitation of the League of Nations and with the consent of the Mayor, he has been sent to various European countries to investigate health administration.

<h3>Jiangsu Provincial Farmers Bank Chongming Branch Opens Today</h3>
<p>Since its establishment last year, the Shanghai Branch of the Jiangsu Provincial Farmers Bank has experienced extremely rapid business growth.

The original location on Minquan Road was converted into an office in Nanshi, and offices were established in Fengxian, Nanhui, Chuansha, and North Bridge in Shanghai to penetrate the interior and directly serve the interests of the rural areas. Recently, in view of the urgent need to regulate the rural economy in Chongming County in order to stabilize it, Mr. Wang Junren was dispatched to the county to prepare for the establishment of a branch. It is reported that preparations have been completed and that the branch will open on November 1st. In terms of business operations, in addition to regulating the rural economy, the branch will also handle remittances, savings, mortgages, and various other savings businesses, which will greatly benefit the people of Chongming County.</p>

<h3>Youth Jumps into Sea for Marriage on Ningxing Steamer</h3>
<p>Fiancée Studies at Zhenjiang Sericulture School - Commits Suicide Due to Frustration from Recent Attitude Change</p>
<p>Datong News Agency reports: The Ningxing steamer of the Sanbei Steamer Company set sail from Shanghai to Ningbo at 5 pm on the 29th of last month. At around 7 pm that night, while the ship was passing through the Litongsha waters, a young passenger in the upper bunk of compartment four jumped into the sea and committed suicide. The details have been investigated by reporters as follows:</p>
<p>Drinking and Eating Before Death</p>
<p>The Ningxing steamer set sail for Ningbo at 5 pm on the 29th. A young passenger also boarded the ship. His berth was by the ship's rail in compartment four. At 6 pm that night, the passenger, feeling hungry, ordered the tea boy Yu Er to purchase a curry chicken rice from the kitchen and a catty of wine, which he drank and ate at will. At around 7 pm, while the ship was passing through the Litongsha waters, the passenger took off his lined long gown and leather shoes, put on a short jacket and straw slippers, and asked the tea boy for several sheets of straw paper, saying that he was going to the toilet at the stern.</p>
<p>Jumping into the Sea at Litongsha</p>
<p>By 8 pm, the passenger had not returned to his berth. The tea boy became suspicious and went to check the toilet at the stern, but he was nowhere to be found. Upon searching the berth, a note was found under the lined long gown he had taken off, written in pencil with the words "Don't look for me, I've jumped into the sea." It was then that they knew he had committed suicide by drowning. Subsequently, a suicide note was found, with the address written on the envelope: "To my elder brother Yin Zhaopeng, Ruixingren Rice Store, No. 90 Qiqihaer Road, Shanghai." The belongings included a lined long gown, a pair of leather shoes, a pair of trousers, a trouser belt, a peaked cap, a silver ring engraved with a skull, and two copies of the "Star" magazine.</p>
<p>Marriage Problems</p>
<p>The steamer returned to Shanghai from Ningbo yesterday morning. The Datong News Agency reporter learned from the steamer and his family that the deceased's name was Yin Zhaoji, from Wusong, aged 23. He had six brothers, and he was the youngest. The deceased had a fiancée named Sui Zhaozhen, from the same hometown, aged 21 this year, who is currently studying at the Zhenjiang Sericulture School. Although they were not yet married, they loved each other very much and exchanged intimate letters. Recently, Yin learned that his fiancée's attitude had changed, and she had stopped replying to his letters. The deceased's nerves were greatly stimulated as a result.</p>
<p>Deceased's Outline</p>
<p>At the age of fifteen, the deceased started his apprenticeship at the Jushun Bean and Rice Store at No. 56 Dou Market Street in Nanshi. Because he was extremely intelligent, he was highly valued by the store and was currently in charge of shipping. Since being stimulated by the marriage, he had often neglected his duties recently. Yang Zhenxiang, the manager of the store, had advised him a few days before his suicide, but he did not expect that he would commit suicide by jumping into the sea. The belongings left on the steamer have been delivered to his brother Yin Zhaopeng at the address indicated.</p>

<h3>Hotel Industry Unifies Room Rate Discounts</h3>
<p>Resolution Passed at Yesterday's Meeting - 20% Discount Based on Original Price</p>
<p>Due to the poor economic climate, hotel associations have been competing to lower prices in order to attract customers, resulting in chaotic room rates with varying levels. In order to plan unified room rate discounts and avoid mutual infighting, a special meeting was held yesterday (30th) with the managers of major hotels at a banquet at the Nanjing Hotel. Over fifty managers from major hotels such as Dadong, Dongya, Dongfang, Great China, Yangtze, New New, Central, Yipinxiang Nanjing, and others attended. First, Dai Buxiang of the Great China Hotel, Chen Wenda of the New World Hotel, and Sun Qiuping of the Asia Hotel successively spoke, all agreeing that unifying room rate discounts is the only way for the hotel industry to save itself at present. It was also resolved that the industry's room rates should be based on a 20% discount off the original price as the standard discount. The resolution was unanimously signed and passed. It is reported that detailed implementation measures will be formulated separately and communicated to the industry for compliance.</p>
<h3>Police Headquarters: Red Pill Offender Executed Yesterday by Firing Squad</h3>
<p>Named Zhang Sisan</p>
<p>Zhang Asan, a local resident, lived in a thatched hut in Laoyingpan. He was impoverished and made a living by scavenging. However, he had been addicted to red pills for years. On August 7th of last year, he was apprehended by the Second District of the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau, and sent to the Songhu Garrison Headquarters. During interrogation, he confessed to his addiction. He was then handed over to the Shanghai Municipal Temporary Drug Rehabilitation Center for compulsory detoxification, after which he was released on bail. On August 25th of this year, the Ximen Branch of the Municipal Police Bureau dispatched officers to Laoyingpan's thatched hut again, apprehending red pill offenders Han Shaowu, Peng Jiayu, Lin Renrong, Yu Jigong, Zhang Asan, Zheng Xingrong, Chen Shaoda, Wu Zixing, and eight others, and confiscating red pill residue, pipes, lamps, and other items. They were all transferred to the Garrison Headquarters by the Public Security Bureau for investigation. Except for Han Shaowu and the other seven, who were first-time offenders and were sent for compulsory medical detoxification, the defendant Zhang Asan confessed to relapsing into drug use, showing utter disregard for the law. He was sentenced to death according to the latter part of Article 5 of the Provisional Regulations for the Strict Prohibition of Potent Drugs, and the sentence was reported to the Peiping Branch of the Military Affairs Commission for approval. At 9:00 AM yesterday, the prisoner was bound and taken to an open space at the intersection of Longhua Road and Jinji Road, where he was executed by firing squad as a stern warning. The Songhu Garrison Headquarters' proclamation is recorded below: After investigation, the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau submitted the case of Zhang Asan's repeat drug use. The Headquarters has reviewed and sentenced him, Zhang Asan, to death in accordance with the latter part of Article 5 of the Provisional Regulations for the Strict Prohibition of Potent Drugs for relapsing into the use of potent drugs after being detained and compulsorily detoxified. The judgment and relevant documents have been submitted to the Peiping Branch of the Military Affairs Commission, and approval has been received. In addition to verifying the identity of the prisoner Zhang Asan and taking him to the execution ground for execution by firing squad as a stern warning, this proclamation is hereby issued for public knowledge. This proclamation announces the execution by firing squad of drug offender Zhang Asan, age 48, from Shanghai, dated July 31st, 24th year of the Republic of China, by concurrent Commander Wu Tiecheng.</p>
<h3>Dispute Over Cattle After Cleanup of Yuanyuan Farm; Obstruction of Cattle Retrieval Leads to Lawsuit</h3>
<p>Kang Maolin entrusted ten head of cattle; repeated attempts to retrieve them were unsuccessful.</p>
<p>Kang Maolin, from Jiujiang, Jiangxi, residing at 77 Bixun Road, entrusted ten foreign breed cattle to Yuanyuan Farm on Daxi Road in November of last year. He held receipts and vouchers from the farm. The farm also kept records of the milk production of the cattle, but he has not received a single cent for their value to this day. Recently, however, the Public Health Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council revoked Yuanyuan Farm's disinfection registration certificate, and Yuanyuan also announced its liquidation. Jin Cheng Bank's Shanghai branch has financial disputes with Yuanyuan and has also filed a lawsuit. Kang applied to the Public Health Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council to retrieve the cattle he had entrusted, and his application was approved. Kang went to retrieve the cattle on September 4th, but was prevented by the police officers from the Xujiahui Police Station stationed at the farm. On September 29th, he went again, but was again prevented by Patrol Chief He Song and Police Officer Li Wenbin from the same police station. Kang negotiated with them, and the two officers telegraphed to Chief Chen Zekuan for instructions. The reply stated that they were acting on the instructions of Wu Yunzhai, the manager of Jin Cheng Bank's Shanghai branch, and were not allowed to return the cattle. As a result, Kang was unable to retrieve the cattle. Kang has now retained lawyer Lou Ying and filed a lawsuit with the First Court against Wu Yunzhai, Chen Zekuan, He Song, and Li Wenbin for the crime of obstructing the exercise of rights, under Articles 28, 29, 134, and 304 of the Criminal Law. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Huang Risheng of the Fifth Criminal Court issued summonses. None of the defendants appeared in court; only Wu's lawyer was present. After Kang Maolin explained the reasons for the lawsuit, Judge Huang stated that he needed to review the files of another case and adjourned the hearing to a later date.</p>
<h3>Verdict in the Kidnapping Case of Nine-Year-Old Sun Shancheng</h3>
<p>Wang Wenhua and others sentenced to twelve years</p>
<p>Sun Shancheng, the beloved nine-year-old son of Sun Cailing, a native of Fenghua who works at the head office of the Farmers Bank of Hankou, residing at 54 Changxing Lane, 344 Beile Road, French Concession, suddenly disappeared around 3:00 PM on August 5th of this year. A letter demanding a ransom of 500,000 yuan for the release of the child was found in the house, revealing that he had been kidnapped. At the same time, Yu Tangshi (also known as Cai Xian or Genhua), a female servant from Shaoxing recommended by Shi Xushi (also known as Xianghua Jie), a maidservant in the Sun Caizhang family, also disappeared. The French Concession Police were immediately notified and requested to investigate. The police dispatched detectives to investigate based on the clues provided by the missing female servant Yu Tangshi. The case was solved step by step by September 13th, and the kidnappers and accomplices Ying Caifang (age 44), Wang Wenhua, Chen Genlin, and Zhang Xiaofu, all from Shaoxing, as well as Chen Tangshi, the sister of the missing female servant Yu Tangshi, were arrested. Ten Bao Shan was also apprehended in Hangzhou with the assistance of the Public Security Bureau and brought to Shanghai. The case was repeatedly heard by the Second Special District Court. However, the victim could not be rescued. Ying Caifang, the key suspect in the case, died of illness while in custody. The detectives of the French Concession Police continued to raise money and rescue the victim. On the evening of the 24th of this month, the victim's family received a call from the kidnappers, informing them that the victim was in room 31 of the China Hotel on Jiujiang Road, Public Concession. They immediately reported to the police, who dispatched detectives to room 32 of the China Hotel, where only the victim Sun Shancheng was found, without any adult accompaniment. Fortunately, the child was still lively and safe. He was immediately taken out, brought back to the police station, and returned to the victim's family. The next day (the 25th), Judge Zhang Chaozuo of the First Criminal Division of the Second Special District Court ordered the defendants in custody to be interrogated again. They all continued to deny any knowledge of the matter. After the court appointed lawyers such as Jin Xiongbai to defend the defendants, the hearing was adjourned, and a date was set for the verdict. All circumstances have already been recorded in this newspaper. Yesterday was the date for the verdict. At 11:00 AM, Judge Zhang presided over the Third Criminal Court and ordered the defendants to be brought before the court. The verdict was announced: Wang Wenhua and Wang Baoshan were sentenced to twelve years imprisonment for conspiring to kidnap for ransom, with deprivation of civil rights for ten years. Chen Tangshi (same charge) was sentenced to ten years imprisonment. Chen Genlin and Zhang Xiaofu (same charge) were each sentenced to seven years imprisonment. The prosecution of Ying Caifang was dismissed. After the verdict was announced, the judge explained the reasons for the judgment to the defendants, stating that after repeated hearings, the court had determined that they were indeed guilty of conspiring to kidnap. However, considering that they had returned the victim, showing a glimmer of conscience, the sentences were reduced accordingly. If they did not accept the verdict, they had ten days from the receipt of the judgment to file an appeal with the Third Branch of the Higher Court. During the appeal period, they would be transferred to the detention center. The judge then adjourned the court, and the bailiffs escorted the defendants to the detention center.</p>
<h3>Multiple Disputes Over Zhu Baoyuan's Estate</h3>
<p>Two married daughters sue two sons for failure to fulfill settlement agreement</p>
<p>Zhu Baoyuan, a tea merchant from Haining, passed away the year before last, leaving an estate worth millions, which was inherited entirely by his sons, Zhu Yanqing and Zhu Shunqing. His two married daughters, Shi Zhu Jun and Wang Zhu Meizhen, initially received no share, leading to a lawsuit between the siblings. Subsequently, a mediator intervened, and Yanqing and Shunqing agreed to distribute the estate to their two sisters, each receiving 80,000 yuan, and a settlement agreement was signed, stipulating that the payments should be made in installments, with the entire amount to be paid within one year. Consequently, Zhu Jun and Zhu Meizhen withdrew their lawsuit. However, since the agreement was signed, more than a year has passed, and Yanqing and others have only paid 80,000 yuan in installments, of which 20,000 yuan were checks guaranteed by Wang Wenzha, the manager of Zhengda Bank, for payment upon maturity, but the checks were not honored when they came due. Therefore, the sisters have already filed a lawsuit against Wang for payment. The remaining 80,000 yuan has also been repeatedly demanded without success. They have now retained lawyer Gu Changyuan to sue Zhu Hengqing, Zhu Shunqing, and Yu Wenzhi in the First Special District Court, recounting the settlement agreement and the amounts received in installments, seeking a judgment ordering the defendants to fulfill the settlement agreement and pay the remaining 80,000 yuan, as well as statutory interest for the delay. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Shen Hong held a hearing. The defendants did not appear in court. Lawyers Jiang Yiping and Zhang Zhengxue appeared on their behalf. After the plaintiff's lawyer stated the reasons for the lawsuit, the defendant's lawyers briefly rebutted the claims. Judge Shen then adjourned the hearing to November 23rd in the afternoon, summoning the defendants to appear in court for further questioning.</p>
<h3>Brothers Accused of Fraud for Opening Securities Firm and Soliciting Shares</h3>
<p>Share money paid, firm not opened; shareholders seek legal remedy</p>
<p>Yin Kunsheng, manager of Xunda Securities Firm in the Securities Building on Hankou Road, and his brothers Yin Yongsheng and Yin Yisheng, all from Ningbo, have recently been sued by Xunda firm shareholders Chen Liancun, Feng Qijun, Zhou Zongyuan, and Shi Huanzhang, who have jointly retained lawyer Cai Liucheng and filed a lawsuit with the First Special District Court, accusing them of jointly committing gross fraud and embezzlement, and seeking civil remedies. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Huang Risheng of the Fifth Criminal Court held a hearing. All three defendants appeared in court as summoned. However, Yin Kunsheng, suffering from phthisis, was supported into the court and was therefore permitted to remain seated during the proceedings. The plaintiffs' representative, lawyer Cai Liucheng, stated that the plaintiffs and defendants were all acquainted. In May of last year, defendant Yin Kunsheng claimed that he wanted to establish a securities firm and had already raised a capital of 11,000 yuan, but was still short of 9,000 yuan. He persuaded plaintiff Chen Liancun to invest and urged him to raise the remaining 9,000 yuan from friends. Chen then invited his friends Yu Bingyong to invest 2,000 yuan and Chen Binggang to invest 1,000 yuan. The money was handed over by Feng Qijun to Chen Liancun, who in turn delivered it to Yin Kunsheng on May 19th, with the understanding that a formal agreement would be signed and the firm would commence operations once all the share money had been collected. Yin Kunsheng also proposed using Xunda as the firm's name. Yin Yongsheng issued a receipt in the name of Xunda Yin Kunsheng. Zhang Langzhai also invested 1,000 yuan, Zhou Zongzhi 1,000 yuan, Shi Huanzhang 1,000 yuan, and Feng Qijun 1,000 yuan, all of which were delivered by Chen to Yin Kunsheng, who signed the receipts. Chen Liancun also remitted 2,000 yuan in his own name on July 3rd of last year, totaling 9,000 yuan. However, after receiving the money, the defendants provided no information and repeatedly delayed signing the agreement, despite numerous requests. On January 22nd of this year, the defendant sent a letter to the plaintiff, pleading for a postponement of the repayment. Although the letter was issued by Yin Kunsheng, it was actually written by Yin Yisheng. Such conduct constitutes the crime of fraud and embezzlement under Articles 339 and 335 of the Criminal Law. In addition to requesting a legal investigation, they also seek civil remedies, requesting an order for the repayment of the 9,000 yuan in share money, plus statutory interest. When questioned, Yin Kunsheng admitted to receiving the 9,000 yuan in share money, but claimed that Xunda Securities Firm had opened for business in June of last year and was still operating, and there was no fraud or embezzlement. Plaintiff's lawyer Cai stated that Xunda Firm had indeed not opened for business, and that the 9,000 yuan of share money paid by the plaintiffs had been transferred by Yin Kunsheng to Taisun Firm, which was opened by Yin Yongsheng. Yin Yongsheng confessed that Taisun Firm had dealings with Xunda Firm and had indeed received 9,000 yuan, and presented his account books. After reviewing the evidence, Judge Huang ordered the case to be adjourned and further questioned on the afternoon of November 9th.</p>
<h3>Xu Busun and Others, Chairman and Committee Members of the Gold Trade Association, Accused</h3>
<p>Accused of Deceiving Merchants by Establishing Illegal Fees Without Approval from the Social Affairs Bureau</p>
<p>—Sha Zhaochang sues for Fraudulent Acquisition of Property—</p>
<p>In addition to the Board of Directors, the Gold Exchange also has organizations such as the Gold Trade Association and the Brokers Association. All gold firms are required to join both the Trade Association and the Brokers Association. Recently, Sha Zhaochang, a native of Jiangyin and manager of Hong Yujin Firm, broker No. 165 of the Gold Exchange, retained lawyer Li Mo and filed a lawsuit with the First Special District Court against Xu Busun (Vice Chairman of the Gold Exchange), Cai Jiusheng, and Zhao Zhongying (also Standing Committee Members of the Gold Exchange Association) for fraudulent acquisition of property. The grounds for the lawsuit stated that the Gold Trade Association, a collective organization of the gold industry, was controlled by the defendants, who exploited it to the fullest extent. In addition to paying a membership fee of 100 yuan and a monthly fee of 2 yuan, members were also required to pay a license fee of 500 yuan in accordance with industry regulations. Supervisors were required to pay a public welfare donation of 20 yuan when they initially took office as managers, and apprentices were required to pay a public welfare donation of 4 yuan when they were first hired. All these were disguised as illegal fees to deceive merchants. The defendants claimed that these industry regulations had been approved by the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, which was consistent with Article 47 of the industry regulations, which stated that the regulations would take effect from the date of approval by the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau. However, the plaintiff had to change managers twice between September and November of last year, paying a public welfare fee of 40 yuan. Later, he discovered that the industry regulations had not been approved by the authorities. He therefore requested the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau to investigate on September 19th. On September 25th, he received a reply stating that the industry regulations had not been approved by the bureau and promulgated for implementation, revealing that it was a complete deception. He therefore filed a self-accusation based on the crime of fraud under Article 339, paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Huang Yuesheng of the Fifth Criminal Court of the First Special District Court held a hearing. The defendants Xu Busun, Cai Jiusheng, and Zhao Ying all retained lawyers An Liankui and Jun, who arrived in court on time. The plaintiff Sha Zhaochang stated the reasons for the lawsuit, arguing that the defendants' actions were completely in violation of laws and regulations, and that the industry regulations stated that they were subject to the approval and implementation of the Social Affairs Bureau. However, since the Social Affairs Bureau had not approved them, the collection of fees constituted the crime of fraud and embezzlement. He was now only prosecuting the crime of fraud. When questioned, the defendants Xu Busun and others claimed that the Gold Trade Association was founded during the Guangxu era and had been in existence for decades. The public welfare donations collected were used for running schools and charitable activities in accordance with the consensus of the industry. Now that the government had promulgated industrial and commercial laws and regulations, the association was being reorganized separately. The industry regulations had been submitted to the Social Affairs Bureau for approval on the 23rd of last month and had not yet been approved. The current fees were all collected in accordance with meeting resolutions and customary practices. They then submitted meeting minutes, account books, and other documents to the court. After reviewing the evidence, Judge Huang Risheng stated that further investigation was required and adjourned the hearing to a later date.</p>
<h3>Female Guest at Nanjing Hotel Attempts Suicide</h3>
<p>Claims surname is Wang, gold ring engraved with name "Guoying"; blood stains on pillow, belt around neck</p>
<p>A woman checked into the Nanjing Hotel on Shantong Lane, Shanxi Road, a few days ago. The woman was fashionably dressed, with a beautiful appearance, and carried a net basket and a leather bag. However, she seemed to have deep worries between her eyebrows. The hotel staff led her to room 421 on the fourth floor. She claimed her surname was Wang and that she was a local, 24 years old. However, she did not mention her given name. Because the matter seemed ordinary, they did not ask further. However, around 11:00 AM yesterday morning, the tea boy on the floor suddenly heard a groan coming from the room, mixed with sobs. Feeling alarmed, he quickly opened the door and entered. He saw her lying on her back in the bed, with blood stains on the pillow, a pale face, and unconscious. There was also a belt around her neck. She appeared to have taken poison and then attempted to hang herself. The tea boy and others rushed forward to help her. They saw that she was slightly awake and asked for her real name, but she still claimed her surname was Wang and did not mention her given name. Soon, she fainted again. They reported to the police, who took her to Renji Hospital for treatment. Her injuries were severe and she was in critical condition. The investigators examined her handbag and found over ten yuan in cash, two gold rings, and a pen engraved with the characters "Guoying." It is unknown whether this is her name. The police are currently investigating.</p>

<h3>Old Zha Police Arrested Gang of Robbers Specializing in Hijacking Inland River Steamers</h3>
<p>Arrested Eight Male and Female Bandits, Confiscated One Handgun, and Numerous Bullets</p>
<p>The Old Zha Police recently received a tip that a large gang of robbers was hiding in the district and planning illicit activities. After careful investigation, the information was confirmed. At 7:30 PM the night before last, Chief Detective You Agen, together with Detectives Liu Junqing, Detective He Xiaozhi, and civilian detectives Yang Guanying and Xu Dezhong, secretly went to No. 46 Xianfu Lane, Kader Road, and arrested Li Rongsheng from Changshu, Wu Genyong, Chen Fusheng from Changzhou, and a woman Wang Xiubao from Liyang. They confiscated one handgun and 96 bullets. Li confessed that there were accomplices, including Li Arong, who was hiding at No. 131, Lane 36, Zhangjiazhai Road, Avenue Edward VII. The detectives rushed there, but Li Arong was not at home. They only arrested Li's mistress Shen Chenshi, a Ningbo woman Zhu Yangshi, and an accomplice Yang Ada. Later, they learned that Li was at No. 91 in the same lane, and they went and arrested Li Arong. They confiscated a handgun under the bed and 95 yuan in cash and 124 bullets in a hidden compartment under a wooden stool. All were taken back to the police station. According to the investigation, these criminals specialized in robbing steamers along the inland rivers. They were all searched and arrested.

<h3>Chen Bingwei, Impersonating a Doctor, Surrenders</h3>
<p>Older Brother Was Indeed a Doctor and Passed Away Long Ago; Younger Brother Impersonates Using Diploma to Continue His Practice</p>
<p>Chen Bingwei, a native of Zhongshan County, Guangdong, who had been hanging a sign as a doctor at No. 623 Sichuan Road, was recently discovered by the police to be impersonating a doctor and suspected of disregarding human life. He was therefore reported to the First Special District Court for legal action. When the court issued a summons for interrogation, Chen falsely evaded it. The court then issued an arrest warrant and ordered a strict investigation. Knowing that he could no longer remain at large, Chen surrendered to the Central Police Station at 5:00 AM yesterday and was subsequently sent to the First District Court for interrogation by Judge Ye Shengchao. Police lawyer Jiang Baolian stated the circumstances of the case, explaining that Chen, currently 36 years old, had studied in New Selham, England, hence his foreign name, "Dunkin." Chen had an older brother named Chaohua, who had studied at Guangzhou Guanghua Medical School. After graduation, he practiced medicine. Chen followed him. In the ninth year of the Republic, the brothers came to Shanghai together and continued to practice medicine. Chaohua passed away in the nineteenth year of the Republic. Chen, believing that he had ten years of experience, used his brother's medical diploma to continue his brother's practice, claiming to specialize in venereal diseases. In July, he treated someone for venereal disease but failed to achieve the desired results, leading the patient to report him to the police. The police investigated and confirmed the facts. On September 4th, they requested the court to issue a summons. Chen fled to Hong Kong. Now, having learned that the court had issued an arrest warrant, he returned to Shanghai and surrendered. The police lawyer, stating that his actions were tantamount to fraud, requested that he be punished in accordance with Article 339 of the Criminal Law. When questioned, Chen Bingcheng admitted that the diploma was indeed a relic of his deceased brother, but claimed that he had ten years of experience, so he dared to continue his brother's practice after his death. It had been four years, and his monthly income was about several hundred yuan. Judge Ye then ordered the defendant to post bail of 2,000 yuan and adjourned the hearing to a later date.</p>
<h3>Chairman Lin Visited the Town God Temple Yesterday</h3>

<h3>China Child Welfare Association to Aid Children in Disaster Areas</h3>
<p>To Send Chen Tiesheng to Ji'nan for Investigation</p>
<p>A reporter from the Guowen News Agency spoke with Chen Tiesheng, the Executive Secretary of the China Child Welfare Association, yesterday. He said that the association had recently received a letter from the Ji'nan Youth Association stating that although the disaster victims of the Shandong flood had received relief from government agencies and were spared from starvation and freezing, and would be able to return to their fields when the flood subsided, there were about 3,000 orphaned children in Ji'nan, of whom about 1,000 were under the age of six. After the flood subsided, they would have no home to return to. Even if they could beg for a living, it would only add a thousand vagrants to society. The letter requested the association to find ways to provide relief and education. The association said that the number was too large and the funds needed were too great, but for the sake of protecting children, it was exploring ways to help. It was learned that relief could be provided to children under the age of six, and that a public place would be sought in Ji'nan to temporarily accommodate them. Chen would be sent to Ji'nan within days to investigate and decide on all measures.</p>

<h3>New Invention: Domestically Produced Cashmere Light Flannel Debuts</h3>
<p>Produced by China Woolen Fabric Factory; Banquet Held at Sun Sun Restaurant Last Night</p>
<p>China Woolen Fabric Textile Factory, specializing in knitting cashmere and hand-knitting cashmere light flannel, is the only large-scale woolen mill initially established in China. Founded by Mr. Chen Yuanqin, Mr. Chen recognized that all cashmere sold was foreign-made, with no domestic production. This single leak amounted to millions of yuan annually. He established this factory to reclaim economic rights. Last summer, Mr. Chen and his son traveled overseas twice to inspect and purchase the latest machinery, selecting a factory site on Linqing Road, Yangshupu, and actively preparing for over a year. It finally opened in September this year. Last night, the factory held a banquet at Sun Sun Restaurant to foster relationships with major companies, merchants, and knitting factories. Over six hundred people attended, making it a grand occasion. Around 7:00 PM, attendees were seated. After three rounds of drinks, Mr. Chen Yuanqin, the factory manager, stood up to report on the preparation process and current situation. Subsequently, Mr. Liu Wenzao, Chairman of the Woolen Industry Association, Mr. Zheng Youdu, representative of the Knitting Association, and Mr. Ding Guanlan of Shengsheng Industrial Society delivered speeches, praising the factory's facilities and products. Finally, Mr. Bi Zhongying, the factory's assistant manager, gave a response. The event concluded around 9:00 PM.

<h3>Pig Merchants Oppose the Harsh Levying of Business Tax: A Compilation of Reports</h3>
<p>Petition to Chairman Chiang to Order a Halt to the Collection</p>
<p>Special Commissioner for Pig Business Tax in Jiangbei Illegally and Harshly Levies Taxes, Intercepts Boats to Count Pigs, Taxing One Item Twice, Exceeding Even the Likin Tax. Pig Merchants Cannot Bear the Burden and Have Repeatedly Appealed to the Competent Authorities, but a Thorough Resolution Has Not Been Reached. It is Reported That Last Month, the Illegal Facts Were Reported to the Office of the Censor. Recently, Another Petition Was Submitted to Chairman Chiang, Requesting an Order to Halt the Collection and Investigate, While Simultaneously Sending a Letter to the Shanghai Fresh Pig Vending Industry Association to Forward the Request to the Authorities for Thorough Investigation. The Text of the Petition to Chairman Chiang Is Recorded Below: Petition Regarding the Jiangbei Pig Business Tax Disregarding Laws and Regulations, Heavy and Excessive Levies, Harsh Treatment of Pig Merchants, and the People's Inability to Endure the Situation. Petition for the Salvation of the People and the Establishment of Law and Order. We merchants reside in Shanghai and have been engaged in the business of transporting pigs for generations, starting from our grandfathers. We purchase pigs primarily from Dongtai. Not only do we do so, but also fresh pig vendors from Dongtai, Rugao, Taizhou, and Nantong to Shanghai and Zhejiang purchase in bulk from Dongtai, purchasing small quantities through pig brokers in the four towns of Pingcha, Jiaoxie, and Libao, Haian, which border Dongtai, Rugao, and Taizhou. They are loaded onto barges and transported to various ports of Tong, Rugao, transferred to riverboats, and distributed to major pig markets in Jiangnan for sale. At that time, the Jiangbei Pig Unified Tax Bureau collected taxes once. When the Central Government abolished all Likin taxes nationwide on January 1, 1931, merchants celebrated. However, in May of the following year, Director Kong of the Business Tax Bureau, with an innovative idea, privately set up checkpoints in Dingyan, Rugao County, along the Shizi Changhe, intercepting thirty to forty passing pig boats, illegally extorting money and threatening lives. Our colleagues jointly appealed to the Jiangsu Provincial Federation of Commerce and the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, reporting the situation to the Ministry of Finance of the Executive Yuan, which ordered a thorough investigation. On October 31, 1932, the Executive Yuan's Order No. 226 instructed the Jiangsu Provincial Government to investigate and cancel the levy. This irrefutable evidence cannot be overturned. Suddenly, last year, Chen Guo from Zhenjiang bid for the contract, paying the Finance Department 136,000 yuan annually, under the name of Jiangbei Pig Vendor Business Tax. He then subcontracted the business tax for Tong and Rugao Counties to Mao Zuotang from Rugao, paying 44,000 yuan annually. Thus, hiding selfish desires, checkpoints were set up like forests, resembling Likin tax stations, extorting recklessly and doing everything possible. At Dingyan, a crucial waterway of Rugao County, forty to fifty pig boats pass every day, collecting two to three hundred yuan in taxes. The rest of the checkpoints in Baipu, Matang, Maqiao, Liqiao, Zhanghuanggang, Zhouxu Port, Sheng Port, Ni Port, and Xiting, Ren Port in Tong County are densely arranged, and the daily collection is even more unimaginable. We merchants have repeatedly suffered oppression and hardship, petitioning the Finance Department dozens of times to alleviate our distress and eliminate our suffering. We received perfunctory replies that were merely lip service. Unexpectedly, before the suffering was eliminated, the authorities in Dongtai, the production area of pigs, and Chen Yunzhang, the director of the business tax bureau in Taizhou and Dongtai Counties, set up checkpoints at Pingcha and intercepted pig boats, collecting two jiao per pig. The tax ticket stated that it was a business tax for the transportation of pigs, two jiao per head, and a special ticket was required to pass through Dingyan, a place of notorious local bullies who subcontracted the pig tax. When the authorities were asked to verify the ticket, they not only refused to verify it but also claimed that the ticket was invalid and required a new declaration, otherwise the boat would be detained. We merchants, with perishable goods, could not afford to delay, so we endured the hardship and pain, pawned our clothes, and gathered money to comply, paying two jiao per pig again. It was found that the tax ticket had the word "持" (hold) diagonally, and the Finance Department's seal was affixed. Other checkpoints demanded another round of taxes, stamped with the seal of Baipu, Ren Port, proving that this multiple taxation of a single pig was truly outrageous. According to the business tax regulations, taxes are collected in spring, summer, autumn, and winter, and each merchant receives only four tax tickets per year. Why are four tickets filled out for each merchant every day? The behind-the-scenes dealings are incomprehensible. Even in the era before the abolition of Likin, there was never such harshness and poison. Moreover, the jurisdictions of the various counties in the northern part of the province are connected and closely linked, all under the jurisdiction of a single finance department. It is evident that they are deceiving those above and excessively levying those below. Our merchants are barely surviving and cannot sit idly by and wait for death. We remember that the late Premier Sun's will emphasized the principle of people's livelihood, but we are still living under a dark sky. Heaven does not pity us, and we are filled with sorrow with no avenue for appeal. We have always admired your benevolence and your commitment to people's livelihood, and your vigorous efforts to abolish exorbitant taxes. Therefore, we dare to attach conclusive tax tickets and present a detailed account of the situation, writing a petition in blood. We respectfully request your review and approval, and to consider the lives of thousands of families of pig merchants, to grant a resolute rescue, to order the immediate cessation of the Jiangbei Special Pig Tax and the Taidong Business Tax, to avoid repeated and excessive cruelty, and to await your orders with utmost sincerity. Presented to Chiang, Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission, by Zhang Yiyuan, Fu Xuegao, pig merchants from Dongtai County; Xue Dawu, Cong Yixing from Rugao County; Xu Zihe, Cai Changzhen, etc. from Nantong County.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Land Bureau Announcement: Strict Prohibition of Lobbying for Land Applications</h3>
<p>Applications Should Be Submitted and Processed According to Proper Procedures; Private Lobbying Is Prohibited and Will Be Subject to Criminal Charges</p>
<p>Since Mr. Cai Zengji, the concurrently acting director of the Shanghai Municipal Land Bureau, took office, all internal and external affairs have been under reorganization. Director Cai, noting that some citizens still engage in the bad habit of private lobbying for land-related matters, issued a special announcement yesterday to strictly prohibit such practices. The full text of the announcement is transcribed as follows: Land administration is most closely related to the people's interests. The competent authorities should uphold fairness and impartiality, with the aim of facilitating the people. When the people submit applications, they should comply with the promulgated laws and regulations and follow proper procedures to seek a just resolution. Since taking office, the Director of this Bureau has been determined to rectify official conduct and has repeatedly instructed subordinates to handle all matters impartially. Any citizen with land-related applications should formally come to the Bureau and follow the prescribed procedures. If the relevant officials make difficulties or demand bribes, they should truthfully report the matter in a confidential letter to the Director, who will thoroughly investigate and punish the offender in order to uphold discipline. On the other hand, if any citizen offers bribes or engages in private lobbying, they will be subject to criminal charges. Such irregular conduct is also not something that law-abiding citizens should do. Once discovered, the Director of this Bureau, for the sake of performing his duties, will strictly investigate both the relevant officials and the citizens involved, without leniency. The law clearly stipulates the same punishment for both the giver and the receiver. Please take note. This announcement is of utmost importance.</p>

<h3>The Cultivation of Elementary School Teachers (I)</h3>
<p>— By Wu Yan Yin</p>
<p>(Lecture to national secondary school teacher trainees on October 25th)</p>
<p>The topic I am discussing today is "The Cultivation of Elementary School Teachers." The audience is teacher trainees from secondary schools. Teacher trainees have not yet become elementary school teachers, much like a young lady who has not yet become a mother. Lecturing on "The Cultivation of Elementary School Teachers" to teacher trainees is like lecturing on "The Cultivation of Mothers" to young ladies. If you talk to a young lady about beauty techniques, dancing, or the philosophy of love... she might be very happy. But if you talk to a young lady about "The Cultivation of Mothers," she might not only not be happy but even find it annoying. If you talk to teacher trainees about career paths or about broad and imaginative educational philosophies, or if you bring out the educational theories of foreign educators, they might be happy to listen. But to talk to teacher trainees about "The Cultivation of Elementary School Teachers"—it is truly like "talking about ice to a summer insect." I think teacher trainees might not only not be happy to listen but even find it annoying.</p>
<p>However, except for a small portion of ladies who are unable to bear children, they will all eventually become mothers. To be good mothers, they must cultivate themselves. The same is true for teacher trainees. Except for a small portion who will take other paths, they will all eventually become elementary school teachers. To be good elementary school teachers, they must also cultivate themselves. Young ladies are probationary mothers, and teacher trainees are candidates for elementary school teachers. A thoughtful young lady, if she thinks about the difficulty of becoming a mother through marriage, might want to hear lectures on "The Cultivation of Mothers." Similarly, an ambitious teacher trainee, if he aspires to be a good elementary school teacher, might quietly listen to my lecture this time. Everyone, you must know that it is not easy to be an elementary school teacher. It is even more difficult to be a good elementary school teacher. We don't need to vaguely state how important the mission of elementary school teachers is. We only need to talk about some trivial issues from a small perspective, and we will realize that being an elementary school teacher, being a good elementary school teacher, is really not an easy thing. Now, let's talk about it from two aspects.</p>
<p>(1) From the perspective of teacher trainees: Teacher trainees often do not pay much attention to the question of "how to be an elementary school teacher." Sometimes, when they happen to see the kinds of subjects taught in elementary schools, they often think that they are not worth mentioning. For example, when they happen to see the Chinese language texts in elementary school textbooks, they might feel that they are too simple and superficial, and that anyone could write them. However, when they become elementary school teachers and are asked to write some simple and superficial texts, it is not easy at all. Even if they manage to write them, they often cannot make the children understand, the wording is inappropriate, and the writing is not fluent. They are truly struggling, with all sorts of problems. You must know that what teacher trainees think and learn, and what they take for granted, often turns out to be completely different when they become elementary school teachers. Just talking about the knowledge and skills learned in teacher training schools, these teacher trainees believe that what they have learned can always be applied in elementary schools. Later, when they arrive at elementary schools, they realize that much of what they have learned is completely useless and much of it is far from reality. For example, the "national history" in Chinese language, the "higher algebra" in mathematics, the more advanced parts of physics and chemistry, and even the "educational trends" and various theories in education, which are spent much effort and talked about extensively in teacher training, are either completely useless in elementary schools or too far removed from reality. Conversely, the kinds of things that are useful in elementary schools are often not learned in teacher training. For example, the history of "drilling wood to make fire," although read about in teacher training, the trainees never actually learned how to drill the wood or make the fire, something that must be done practically in elementary school. Also, although advanced physics and chemistry are learned in teacher training, when elementary school children ask extremely simple questions, the teachers often cannot answer them. I have a friend who teaches in a teacher training school, responsible for teaching methods and the study of elementary school teaching materials. Once, he told me that one of his top teacher training students, after graduating and becoming an elementary school teacher, received a copy of the elementary school curriculum standards promulgated by the Ministry of Education. There were many places he did not understand, so he came back to ask my friend to explain them to him. My friend then realized that the lessons he taught in teacher training were too theoretical and not practical enough for elementary schools. Therefore, he advocated using the elementary school curriculum standards as teacher training textbooks for studying teaching materials and teaching methods. In fact, my friend is one of the top elementary school education experts in the country. He has been teaching in teacher training schools for almost twenty-five years or more. The lessons he teaches are certainly much more practical than those taught by others, but he still feels that they are not practical enough, that he has not taught the teacher trainees the things that are truly used in elementary schools. Then, it can be imagined that other kinds of lessons taught by other people are even less applicable to elementary schools. It can be clearly proven that what is useful in elementary schools is not learned in teacher training. Since what is learned in teacher training is often useless in elementary schools, and what is needed in elementary schools is often not learned in teacher training, then teacher trainees, after becoming elementary school teachers, must continue to learn and must work hard to cultivate themselves.

<p>Shanxi Team Leader Zhang Fuyuan Comes to Shanghai to Accompany Them, The Wangs Are Reluctant to Leave Shanghai, May Return</p>
<p>The Shanxi tennis sisters, Wang Chunqing and Wang Chuncang, were previously invited by the Kaifeng New Life Club and have agreed to perform there. They could have left earlier, but they had to wait for Zhang Fuzhi, the Shanxi team leader who was going to Beijing, to accompany them. I met the Wang sisters at their residence yesterday. According to them, Mr. Zhang Fuzhi has returned to Shanghai from Beijing a few days ago, so it has now been decided to depart immediately. They will transfer to Henan via the Longhai Railway and will stay in Kaifeng for at most three or four days before returning to Shanxi. They gained a good impression from participating in the National Games in Shanghai this time, but they feel that their tennis skills are not yet perfect and hope that all sectors will provide accurate criticism. Shanxi Province has made much progress in sports in recent years, and various sectors are very enthusiastic about promoting tennis. They spent two decades in Shanghai and are reluctant to leave. If they have the opportunity in the future, they would very much like to see the people of Shanghai again.</p>

<h3>Little Men (81)</h3>
<p>— Originally written by American author Louisa May Alcott, translated by Zheng Xiaocang</p>
<p>The first thing she said tomorrow morning was: "Has my trunk come? People tell her that it will probably come today but she is still grumbling. Then came more shouting, even whipping her own daughter, which scared Little May. But she managed to hold on. But by 5 o'clock, she was gone. People thought that maybe she went to the hill with Tommy, so no one cared. But by dinner time, she was still not back, so people began to ask, "Where did Nan go?"</p>
<p>At this time, the young maid, Ann Marie, came in with some kind of wheat paste, and she said, "I saw her alone, running down the road as fast as she could."</p>
<p>"She has already run home, this little sprite!" Mrs. Bhaer cried, with an anxious look on her face.</p>
<p>"Maybe she went to the station to look for her luggage," Franz guessed.</p>
<p>"That's not going to happen. She doesn't know the way. And even if she did know the way, she couldn't carry that trunk for three miles," said Mrs. Bhaer, starting to feel that her new idea might not be easy to put into practice.</p>
<p>"Yet that would be just like her," said Mr. Bhaer, immediately grabbing his hat to go out and look for her. Suddenly, the lodger standing at the window shouted, causing everyone to run to the door to look.</p>
<p>Sure enough, wasn't that Miss Nan coming? She was carrying a heavy trunk on her back, using a cloth bag to support it on her shoulders. She looked truly tired, hot, and covered in dust, but she was still walking with courage. She climbed up the steps, puffing and panting, put down her heavy load, and breathed a sigh of relief as if saying, "Finally arrived!" Then, she crossed her tired arms on top of the trunk and said:</p>
<p>"I really couldn't wait any longer, so I went to get it myself."</p>
<p>"But you don't know the way," said Tommy, as the others stood around, feeling that this was extremely strange.</p>

<h3>Market Speculation Becomes Frantic</h3>
<p>—Yesterday's Situation—</p>
<p>Yesterday's market speculation was frantic, with sudden ups and downs, and the shouts of the traders shook the roof. In the government bond market, the opening prices in the morning were up sharply, but the closing prices were down by 1.7 or 8 yuan. The two trading sessions did not end until 4:30 PM. The exchange's market price board had to be extended to the twenty-year consolidated tax closing price (morning session), and the right-side market price board (which was usually used for the afternoon market price) was used to open the market price, which shows the extent of the frantic trading. The afternoon market opened at 9:00 PM, and the market price rebounded by 2 yuan. Short-term gold jumped more than 3 yuan, which was the largest increase. Cotton yarn was even more sought-after. The December contract opened with a sharp jump of 10.3 yuan, and the other contracts also rose by 5 or 6 yuan. By the closing, except for the current month's contract, all were at 195 or 6 yuan, an increase of 8.5 yuan to 7 yuan compared to the previous day. The highest price for period cotton reached 40 yuan, with most contracts increasing by 2.2 or 3 yuan, and the lowest increase was 1 or 2 yuan. The root cause was still the influence of gold prices. The highest price for gold yesterday was 1227 yuan, and the closing price was 1160 yuan, which was lower than the previous day's closing price, but the fluctuation of 65 yuan in one day caused many people to favor foreign exchange inflows. However, exchange rates remained tight, and the amount of money owed to foreign banks was high. The interest on overdrafts was still 70%, and the shortage of funds was still estimated at 2 or 3 million. Such frantic market speculation is rare. The main reason is the uncertainty about how the currency inflation will proceed.</p>
<h3>Finance The Bulls Take Profits at High Prices, Premium Reacts with a Fall</h3>
<p>The Market Once Again Sets a New Peak of 1227 Yuan</p>
<p>The Exchange Market Turns Stiff, Resulting in a Drop of 14.8 Yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday, the gold market experienced a sharp fall after a portion of the bulls, having satisfied their desires, exited the market after a significant rise. The reaction was quite strong. Stimulated by the overnight gray market, the market immediately showed a new peak of 1227 yuan. Subsequently, as the exchange market loosened, the bulls seized the opportunity to liquidate, resulting in a massive drop of over 60 yuan. In the early morning, the overseas silver market saw England rise and the United States remain flat. The forward price of silver in Montreux continued to fall by 5 hao to 2 li 1, and the exchange rate slightly increased. The price of London raw gold fell by half a penny. People's confidence was strengthened by the overnight gray market, which raised the price to over 1100 yuan. The pre-market trading opened in extreme chaos. Yongli advanced slightly, once rising to around 1220 yuan. Fuxing, Yongda, and Decheng sold off, falling to around 200 yuan. Hengyu, Dada, Chunyuan, Yongyi, Cheng, and Yongli all advanced, rising back to 16-17 yuan. Dada, Decheng, Fuyu, Fuxing, and Yong seized the high price and sold again, falling to 023 yuan. The Central Bank's listed prices were announced, with both England and the United States shrinking. The customs gold unit rose by 3 fen 4 li, and the standard premium price was listed as 1075 yuan 1 jiao. Sentiment was still good. After the opening, the buyers were quick to act, immediately rising beyond the 10 yuan mark. However, because the bulls took profits at high prices, there were repeated declines. The Bank of Communications also released November shillings, and sentiment remained buoyant. It was anticipated that HSBC would list, with England shrinking by 25 and the United States by half a yuan. At this point, it hovered outside the 10 yuan mark. HSBC seized the opportunity to sell expensively, and the exchange market loosened, once falling back by more than 10 yuan. However, the buyers maintained at the low, and the shorts also covered. Soon after, it rose again to a peak of 1227 yuan. The Bank of Japan, HSBC Shanghai, China, and others sold, and the Central Bank vigorously sold spot shillings. The exchange market tightened, and sentiment weakened, lacking support. The selling pressure intensified, and a sudden fall broke through four major levels, falling to 1175 yuan. However, the shorts took profits, and the buyers were still eager. Soon after, it rose back to over 90 yuan. Major players significantly reduced long positions, predicting that Indian silver would rise by 5 anna, and then retreated to within 80 yuan. The Guangdong banks maintained at the low, and the afternoon close was still stable. Unexpectedly, after the close, it suddenly declined. The after-market was strengthened by significant support, turning from weak to firm. However, due to Sassoon's selling, the exchange market hardened, making it easy to fall. The buyers maintained at the low, and Indian silver was reported to be up 4 anna. The situation was uncertain, rising and falling around 80 yuan for quite some time. Helplessly, rumors of profitable selling led to a reaction in sentiment. A portion of the bulls clearly exited the market, and finally there was a disastrous fall. November public bonds will begin to be collected today. The shorts have already released 952 bonds yesterday. The market situation for today will be recorded below.</p>

<h3>End of the Ten-Bottom Long-Term Summary</h3>
<p>Assets are around 40 million, Liabilities are 85-60 million</p>
<p>According to the estimates of the financial sector yesterday, the amount of long-term transactions and transfers made at the ten-bottom was roughly: commercial bank long-term deposits of 18.9 million, long-term loans of 34 million+, pawnshop long-term deposits of 2 million+, long-term loans of 4.5 million+, Ningbo banks long-term loans 18 million+, Hankou loans in the long-term, beyond those already collected, still have 5.6 million+. The total long-term deposits were approximately 40 million, with outstanding long-term loans totaling 85-60 million, an increase of 10 million+ compared to the total of 60-70 million from the tenth (4th bottom) session. This is due to the transfer of current accounts to long-term, the continued new transactions by generally sound silver and money businesses, and a significant number of solid households in the interior entrusting Shanghai shops to conduct transactions, which is why the current session has a higher amount than in previous years.</p>
<h3>The Cause and Effect of Sudden Credit Tightening</h3>
<p>—Foreign Banks Want to Collect 40 Million in Cash—</p>
<p>The increase in transfer fees in the past few days, up to the maximum fee (7 jiao), has attracted attention from various sectors, but few know the reason for this. After inquiries from reporters to various parties, people familiar with the situation said that the tightening in the past few days was expected. In September, a significant number of speculators sold forward shillings and premium foreign exchange, as well as imported goods. This time, the gold price suddenly rose sharply, breaking through the 1,000 yuan mark, and even reaching more than 1,200 yuan. As such, the previously sold shilling foreign exchange and various prices differed greatly, and the amount of compensation needed was substantial, which had to be paid to foreign banks, so the transfer fees suddenly became extremely tight. Furthermore, on the 28th and 29th, foreign banks sold off their pledged securities and previously purchased spot public bonds on a large scale. Due to the difficult times, adjustments were difficult, so they all sold at market prices. The value of the accounts receivable was no less than 20 million+, plus the settlement of shilling foreign exchange and other funds of 10 million+, and the monthly routine settlement also collected 7 million+. Thus, the foreign banks on the Bund needed to collect 40 million in cash within 3-4 days. At a time when the Shanghai market was tight, how could such funds be available to cope? Therefore, a large-scale collection was initiated, and the market suddenly tightened, with the transfer fee increasing dramatically. This is the cause and effect of the sudden credit tightening. However, in our opinion, even if this huge amount of cash can be collected at the end of this month to pay the foreign banks and barely overcome the difficulty, the total summary period from the next month to the end of the year is only two months away. It is impossible to quickly collect huge funds to make up for it. If this continues, the financial situation will become tighter and tighter day by day, which will be an unavoidable reality.</p>
<h3>Transfer Fee at 7 Jiao Unchanged</h3>
<p>—Rumored Still Short of Over 3 Million—</p>
<p>Yesterday was the busy period for the end of October, busier than usual, but the busyness of the procedures this time was actually greater than that of the year-end final accounts. Long-term collections are within their duties, but the foreign banks on the Bund are urging the collection of various foreign exchange shilling settlement funds and securities costs, etc. The procedures are complicated and the amount is huge, so the situation is very difficult. The foreign interbank rate is still the same as before, 1 jiao 7 fen in the morning and afternoon, and the transfer fee cannot be increased, so it is still set at 7 jiao, but no one is willing to accept it. As a result, the shortages are quite large, and the total plan shows a shortage of more than 3 million. Although the money industry reserves are used to make up the shortages, it is difficult to make bricks without straw, and the money shops must find their own solutions. For check transactions, the morning transfer was 3.3-4 million, and new transactions were 600,000+. Afternoon transactions were 400,000+. Transactions in the small general meeting were 8-900,000. Banknotes recovered were 700,000+, and secret mark volumes issued were 300,000+. The circulation of beads was 400,000+. Foreign pledges recovered were 900,000+, and new transactions were 400,000+. Hakka sources were 200,000, and outflux was 150,000. Bank collections are too much in and out on this day, and the difference in transfer fees is even greater, so the time must be extended. Therefore, the closing yesterday was usually not completed until 8-9 pm. It is difficult to estimate the number in the draft. As for the usual collection amount, a rough estimate is that the various collections of foreign and Japanese banks are at least more than 40 million, and the collections of Chinese banks are also 30-40 million. The amount placed in storage is 1.5 million, special collections are 10 million+, pawnshops and foreign public collections are 55 million+, foreign transfer fee collections are 15 million+, various exchange funds are 800,000+, cash releases are 200,000+, and other special payments are 10 million+.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Guangdong small silver was 768 yuan in the morning market and 779 yuan 4 jiao in the afternoon market. The difference between the two markets was roughly yuan. The transaction volume in the morning was 120,000 jiao, and in the afternoon it was 55,000. Copper coins were lent for 1,500 cash, totaling 315,500 cash. The transaction volume was 36,905,000 cash, equivalent to 11,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Securities The Wildly Rising and Falling Bond Market</h3>
<p>Three Changes in One Day…Causing Huge Upheaval The Market Price is High…Setting a Record for This Year</p>
<p>Yesterday, the prices on the Chinese Securities Exchange rose and fell wildly, with unusually turbulent waves that were unapproachable. The madness of the rising trend was due to it being excessive, triggering the exit of the bulls, and the fierceness of the falling trend was beyond reason. As a result, the 48th bull suddenly exited the market, so there was a rumor about inflation, and soon after, rumors arose like bees, and the market was violently shaken, with an alarming difference that was unprecedented this year. According to the head plate market, it was the highest new record for the 24th year. The trading was so hot that each round took two hours to complete. At this point, the market situation had completely deviated from the track. The 48th bull's position shook, and the 16th short took advantage of the situation to pressure it, and there were two consecutive rounds that were absolutely opposite and very far apart. There are many storms ahead. The opening of yesterday's proceedings was followed by a violent upward trend, even more so than the big increase at the close of the previous day. The current month's gold short rose wildly by 2 yuan 7 jiao, and was only a few steps away from the limit price. Numbers 21, 33, 47, 48, and 78 all bought in. The next round was delayed until after 3:00 p.m. before it started. Numbers 11, 47, 48, and 78 suddenly changed their style and all tended to sell, causing an extraordinary drop. The current month's gold short fell wildly by 3 yuan 8 jiao, which was unexpected. At the same time, rumors arose, still the same as before, with unfounded speculation. The afternoon session was delayed until 8:45 p.m. before it began. The market turned up again, and with great force. Most of the prices were raised, from 3-5 jiao to 1-2 yuan. The gold short rose by 3 yuan 3 jiao, and the market was high and low, almost entirely in the hands of the big players. As a result, market prices rose by a few jiao to 2 yuan 3 jiao. The total number of transactions was about 50 million across the three rounds. The results of the increases and decreases are compared in the table below (unit: yuan)</p>

<h3>Yarn Flowers: Unconventional Yarn Flower Frenzy, Market Filled with Buying, Bears Cutting Losses</h3>
<p>Yarn Reaches a High Price of $198, Cotton at $41.35</p>
<p>The yarn market is experiencing a surge, like a runaway horse, with unprecedented enthusiasm, reaching its peak. New record prices have been seen in the past two days, fueling rumors of increasing inflation, thus shocking the market. The strength of buying is unstoppable, causing widespread panic among bears. The opening of the forward market for December saw a shocking price jump, with one lot soaring by $10.03, a rare occurrence in recent years. The future outlook remains stormy.</p>
<p>Cotton Yarn Jumps $7-8</p>
<p>The opening of the cotton yarn market was marked by a sudden surge in prices, reaching an unprecedented high, stirring the market. Rumors abounded, creating a tense atmosphere, rarely seen before. Many speculators were forced to cut losses at market prices. All months broke through $190. The opening of the forward market was chaotic, with a cacophony of shouts and calls. November futures opened at $191.50, up $5.90. December futures saw a buying frenzy like a storm, reaching $198, a jump of $10.02. January futures were at $196, up $8.50. The situation was very volatile. A large volume was sold off by a certain firm in Weizhou, and after the first lot, the market calmed down, and the cotton yarn market eased slightly. Some profit-taking by short sellers led to a slight pullback. As a result, each month saw a rise of $4.40 to $5.80 compared to the previous day's closing price. Although the gold market was sluggish in the afternoon, selling pressure suddenly intensified due to a major cotton mill in the interior aggressively covering its positions. Changfeng bought over 11,000 bales, and continued to buy in the after-market, leading to a depletion of market supply. The market steadily climbed higher, resulting in further gains of $2 to $3.90 for each month compared to the morning closing price. Sales were recorded: Gengfeng 7,550 bales, Xincheng 3,450 bales, Yuda 1,500 bales, Mingde 1,150 bales, Yuan Yi 1,150 bales, Run Kang 3,100 bales, Dafu 1,650 bales, Jinchang 2,250 bales, Tongji 1,350 bales, Yichang 1,000 bales, Dachangcheng 1,200 bales.

<p>The cotton market is experiencing exceptionally severe price increases, with the market in a critical state. Spot prices are skyrocketing, breaking through $1,210. Rumors are intensifying, and the market is frenzied. Buying is exceptionally strong, and bears are constantly cutting losses. The market is soaring to new heights, advancing without limits.</p>
<p>Zheng Cotton Merchants Short Squeezed</p>
<p>The opening of the spot cotton market was marked by a uniform surge in prices across all months. The panic in the market was unprecedented. Spot prices were rising sharply, with no end in sight, causing widespread anxiety. Bears were in a state of disarray. The trading floor was particularly volatile. Fortunately, some longs took profits, slightly easing the market. However, in the auction for March futures, Tongji aggressively bought, jumping $3 to $41.35. By the second lot, news of declining spot prices led to a calmer market and a slight pullback. As a result, each month rose by $0.60 to $1.11 compared to the previous day's closing price. The opening of the afternoon market saw a renewed intensification of the price surge. Buying pressure was particularly strong, with one mill aggressively covering its positions, tightening the market. However, Tongfei longs suddenly liquidated, still fueling the price rally. As a result, each month rose again by $0.50 to $1.15 compared to the morning closing price. Far-month contracts broke through the $40 mark. Sales were recorded: Tongji 10,600 dan, Tongfu 3,800 dan, Jifeng 2,700 dan, Yuanda 3,400 dan, Gengfeng 6,500 dan, Tongfeng 2,800 dan, Dachangcheng 2,900 dan, Yichang 4,000 dan, Jiankang 6,600 dan, Xincheng 9,500 dan, Hexing 4,600 dan, Changfeng 3,000 dan.

<h3>Grain: Financial Conglomerates and Hoarders Absorbing, Du Yang Rice Soars 20-30 Cents</h3>
<p>12,000 Bags of Ke Xian Rice Opened</p>
<p>Yesterday, Ke Xian rice remained strong, with faster sales. The market is gradually rising. Yesterday's purchases were largely absorbed by financial conglomerates and hoarders, especially a certain money house in the North City. Tianjin merchants also specialized in Yong rice, purchasing about 2,000 bags. Actual sales in this street totaled less than 1,000 bags. Due to off-market hoarders anticipating the reality of inflation, their buying interest is extremely strong. Therefore, yesterday's Gan rice, etc., jumped 20-30 cents. In the past two days, it has soared by more than 50 cents. Yong rice continued to rise by about 10 cents yesterday. Other Ke Xian rice also rose by 10-20 cents. The city-wide opening saw 3,700 bags of Gan rice, 2,492 bags of Yong rice, 1,295 bags of Wentai rice, 1,600 bags of Yue rice, 3,000 bags of Han rice, and 150 bags of Xiang rice, totaling about 12,000 bags.</p>
<p>Imported rice also rose sharply yesterday, with floating supplies depleted. Market sentiment is optimistic. Yesterday, 500 bags of Saigon rice and 200 bags of Xiaojiao rice were sold, which were sold by this street to hoarders. 55 bags of Siamese Yuan rice were sold for actual consumption.</p>
<p>(South Shanghai) Over 20 ships arrived yesterday. The market situation was driven up by 20 cents due to the rise in gold prices and aggressive purchases by imported rice hoarders. Lu Yang rice and sharp pointed rice were in good shape for over 10 cents, and Bo Dao Po Long also showed fresh color. A total of over 1,000 bags were opened for old and new rice. Other stomachs are also moving.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) 35-36 shipments arrived from various regions. New Japonica rice from various channels, rice store stomachs, and four rural areas were mobilized. The market for high-quality rice tightened by about 10 cents. Medium-quality rice rose by 10-20 cents. Broken Japonica rice sales were normal, and prices turned to a tight trend. Bo Dao rice was stable. Yao rice and Bage rice also tightened by 10-20 cents. Du Jian and Yangbu Ke Jian rice sales were lively, and prices tightened by 10-20 cents. Bai Yuan rice added nearly 10 cents. Other goods also tightened by a few cents to 10 cents.</p>

<p>Yesterday was the delivery for October flour futures, totaling 77,000 bags. This included 60,000 bags of Xinda Green Battery and 17,000 bags of Fuxin Factories 2 &amp; 3 Green Battleship. It is reported that the volume of Green Battleship flour delivered off the exchange reached over 100,000 bags. Due to good sales from the purchasing merchants, all were settled. Regarding the price of flour for the next month, if gold prices soar, the market is expected to be driven up. Industry insiders speculate that reducing the import tax on imported wheat may alleviate the increasingly high prices.</p>
<p>Wheat delivery was not significant, totaling only 12 truckloads. Trucks 26 and 27 each delivered 3 truckloads, truck 23 delivered 4 truckloads, and trucks 41 and 42 each delivered 1 truckload.

<p>Shen Bao Literary Weekly</p>
<h3>Symbolism and Literature</h3>
<p>— Xu Qinwen</p>
<p>"Literature is a symbol of melancholy," said Chufukubai Village, who wrote a special book to explain that the source of all literature is melancholy; but it is not a direct complaint, it is a symbol. Therefore, all literary works are inseparable from the function of symbolism.</p>
<p>Not only literature, but also painting is a symbol; for example, if you paint a pine tree or a willow, the number of branches and leaves is always much less than the number of the original, and the ratio of the size and length of the leaves and branches, and the branches and trunks are very disproportionate; but at a glance, this is a pine tree, that is a willow, and the viewer can always recognize it, because it is "spiritual likeness." If a photograph is taken, the number of branches and leaves will not be reduced, and the degree of proportion will not be different, but it is not necessarily similar. Originally, the reduction in the same way is not as good as the spiritual likeness that can preserve the truth; so painting is a work of art, and photography is not considered a formal art.</p>
<p>According to the above, it can be seen that symbolism is to simplify the subject matter first, and the result is to represent it by analogy.</p>
<p>The most obvious symbolism in literature is the record of words; the direct words written in parentheses, in form, seem to be a word-for-word record of the original words, but this is not the case. This is by no means a record of a lecture; it is only a summary, and the points that can be used as representatives are revealed and written down.</p>
<p>Simplifying the subject matter step by step in this way, so that it is represented by analogy, is only a broad sense of symbolism. Usually, the so-called symbolism in literature is a narrow sense, that is, the original form of the subject matter is completely abandoned, and another fact is assumed to represent it. This is because the inherent plot of the subject matter is complex and cumbersome, and if it is described truthfully, it is not only overwhelming, but also impossible to start. For example, from ancient times to the present, the restraints imposed on women, and the joys and sorrows before and after being restrained, are simply impossible to write out in fact. Lainer's "Garden of Joy" has only a few lines, but it expresses all the important situations. Another example is Maupassant's "Necklace" and "Wild Grass" in "Kite," both of which are not long in length, but each entrusts infinite irreparable regrets.</p>
<p>Or, all the emotions of joy, anger, sorrow, and joy, or high-level ideals, are originally abstract; emotions are the so-called "unprovoked," and the scenery in the ideal is "future;" to write a successful work, it is necessary to first assume a stable fact that can be used to entrust, the so-called "concretion," is also this kind of symbolism. These works are mostly lyrical, but they can also be used as a tool to explore various issues.</p>
<p>The broad sense of symbolism is a must in literary works; the use of narrow symbolism is due to helplessness, because it is not enough to express. Whether it is broad or narrow, it must be used according to the opportunity, but it cannot be overused. After the color of symbolism is too strong, or used inappropriately, it will fall into mystery, and it is not easy for readers to understand, so it is difficult to achieve the effect.</p>
<p>In the history of literature, there is also the name of "Symbolism"; those writers who have formed their own school not only deliberately use the means of narrow symbolism, but also take symbolism as their ability, making it mysterious and unpredictable; moreover, because they are not satisfied with the environment at that time, they do not have the courage to actively struggle, and there is no determination to work hard to transform, they just like to fantasize and are accustomed to fabricating illusions. "Escapist" and "non-realistic" are always unworthy of being taken although they are written very beautifully.</p>
<h3>Stone Plate</h3>
<p>— Chen Zizhan</p>
<p>Confucius: I'm too tired today, I'm very tired. I have never been willing to admit that I am old, but today I feel that I am going to be old. Zilu, do you feel tired?</p>
<p>Zilu: Master, I don't feel tired, I just think it's too hot today. Why don't you use an umbrella on such a sunny day? Didn't Zigong buy a new umbrella?</p>
<p>Confucius: Zilu, that's like you, who is willing to borrow anything, even if it's broken, you don't care. Zigong is a good calculator, and he values things very much. I am not willing to borrow an umbrella from him even on a rainy day, let alone today is a sunny day!</p>
<p>Zilu: Master knows that he is going to climb the mountain today, why doesn't he take a cane? With a cane in hand, it would be easier to climb mountains and hills, wouldn't it?</p>
<p>Confucius: Cane? Don't mention it. Yesterday I broke the leg of Yuan Rang, the old man, and even broke the cane.</p>
<p>Zilu: Master often says that I am brave and aggressive, rude and rude, and used to use fists and legs. Why do you want to hit people too?</p>
<p>Confucius: Zilu, I don't bother to talk to you. You need to know that it is precisely because that old man is rude and I can't stand him that I knocked on his shins. I am very thirsty now, can you go down the mountain to get some clear water for me to drink? You must go quickly and come back quickly, don't play around, I'm waiting here.</p>
<p>Zilu: Oh, I'll be back soon, I'll be back soon. I'm also thirsty.</p>
<p>Confucius: This child is used to causing trouble, and I'm worried. I'll go and see.</p>
<p>Zilu: Scaring Da Bing, drinking plain water, taking a nap, this is our master's daily homework. Today he wants to swim in the mountains. After drinking the boiled water, he wants to drink cold water. Just look at him! Is there any clean water in this place? Uh, isn't there a pool in front? That's right, that's right.</p>
<p>(A tiger jumped out of Luwan.)</p>
<p>Bah! Bah, embryo... See my father kill you, beast, beast! Where are you running to?</p>
<p>(He caught up, touched the tiger's tail, and cut it off.)</p>
<p>Damn it! Do you want your life or not?…… Wait a minute. This tail is so fun. I want to hide it in my arms and take it home to see if the Master knows it or not. Oh, it's been too long, maybe the Master will scold me again. Hurry up and take out the water bottle and get the water back.</p>
<p>Confucius: Why hasn't this child come back yet? Maybe he's caused some trouble again.</p>
<p>Zilu: Master, the water is here.</p>
<p>Confucius: Why did you take so long? I'm tired of waiting. Come, quickly give me the water to drink.</p>
<p>Zilu: Master, I'm sorry! I suddenly thought of a problem on the way.</p>
<p>Confucius: What problem?</p>
<p>Zilu……</p>
<p>Confucius: Speak! Just say it! You can say anything. Don't be afraid to speak in front of the teacher. You can say it.</p>
<p>Zilu: Master, how does a superior person kill a tiger?</p>
<p>Confucius: A superior person kills a tiger by hitting its mouth.</p>
<p>Zilu: How does a middle-class person kill a tiger?</p>
<p>Confucius: A middle-class person kills a tiger by grabbing its ears.</p>
<p>Zilu: How does an inferior person kill a tiger?</p>
<p>Confucius: An inferior person kills a tiger by touching its tail.</p>
<p>Zilu……</p>
<p>(Zilu was dumbfounded and didn't know what to say. Confucius was drinking water, pretending not to see it.)</p>
<p>Confucius: Zilu, the scenery in front must be better. You can take a step ahead to see if there is a mountain road that can pass. After I finish drinking the water and rest for a while, I will come.</p>
<p>Zilu: Oh, Master, I'm leaving. - Strange, strange! How would the Master know about this? He knew there was a tiger by the water, why did he ask me to get water? Knowing that there are tigers in the mountains, he insisted on walking by the tigers. Isn't this clearly trying to feed me to the tigers? How unreasonable, you heartless old man! You want to feed me to the tigers and make me die an unnatural death, so don't blame me, Zilu, for being a rude man, brave and rude. Okay, you know I have a tiger tail in my arms, so I'll throw this thing away. Let me think of a way to kill you. Oh, I've got it! There is a stone plate here, I don't know who left it. Great! I will hide it in my arms and turn around to kill you, you heartless old man. - But how to do it?</p>
<p>Confucius: Zilu, is there a mountain road to go up here?</p>
<p>Zilu: (Seemed not to hear, still standing there in a daze.)</p>
<p>Confucius: Hey! Zilu, what are you doing standing here?</p>
<p>Zilu: (Turning around) Master, you're here, just right, I just thought of another question.</p>
<p>Confucius: What problem do you have again? It's good to say it.</p>
<p>Zilu: Master, how does a superior person kill someone?</p>
<p>Confucius: A superior person kills people with the tip of a pen.</p>
<p>Zilu: How does a middle-class person kill someone?</p>
<p>Confucius: A middle-class person kills people with words.</p>
<p>Zilu: How does an inferior person kill someone? Confucius: An inferior person kills people with a stone plate!</p>
<p>Zilu: Stone plate? How did you know?……</p>
<p>(Greatly surprised, took a few steps back. He couldn't control himself, and the stone plate rolled down from his arms!)</p>
<p>(The curtain closes)</p>

<h3>Three Foreigners</h3>
<p>— Chunxun</p>
<p>It is very difficult to find such a vast open space in Tokyo. This is a wilderness overgrown with weeds, with two higher places opened up into baseball fields. A long earthen embankment, covered with thatch and thorns, lies on the chest of this wilderness; at the end of the embankment, there are two high hills, with only lush grass and no trees.</p>
<p>At the time when the twilight slowly swallowed the setting sun, we, three men and women wandering in a foreign land, also dragged our heavy steps and walked on this lonely wilderness. We stepped over the weeds buried with gravel, and climbed up this small hill along the steep and winding path. The evening wind, with a bit of tyrannical power, ruffled the short hair of the two women, and almost blew my thin Japanese-style yukata to pieces.</p>
<p>The surrounding dense houses have already been shrouded in hazy twilight. Not far to our right, a deeply sunken provincial railway line, forming a T-shape with the long embankment, is constantly running with noisy trains. At the front of the long embankment, there is a row of buildings built of water bucket piers, in the form of rural tombs, and no doors or lights can be seen. We suspect that this is the place to store artillery fire for artillery fire drills, because the evening wind often sends us vague gunshots from that side.</p>
<p>Looking further, on the wave of rooftops dotted with tree canopies, several modern buildings stand majestically. The shining neon lights also float with hazy light. That is the bustling area of Tokyo's petty bourgeoisie, "Shinjuku."</p>
<p>The strolling tourists on the wilderness gradually disappeared as the twilight deepened. I took off the "geta" (clogs) and let them sit on it as a cushion on the side of the path, and I picked up the leather slope opposite and sat down. In the dark purple clouds on the horizon, I found a pale crescent moon.</p>
<p>In such a situation, talking is a burden! However, the lively Yin finally couldn't hold back her talkative mouth:</p>
<p>"If we always sit silently, people will think we are here for 'shinju' (double suicide)! Kahi!"</p>
<p>Yin laughed first, then I laughed, and finally the melancholy Shan laughed. But the evening wind immediately ruthlessly blew away our laughter, leaving me no time to savor the true meaning of this laughter.</p>
<p>I don't know when, two twinkling little stars appeared in the sky, and we all looked up at them. Then a few smaller stars drilled out. Both Yin and Shan were short-sighted, and no matter how hard I tried to explain and point them out, they couldn't see them, and turned around and accused me of lying. I angrily scolded "blind."</p>
<p>The night was deep, and the neon lights of "Shinjuku" became brighter and brighter, and an arc-shaped pale red halo covered the heads of those buildings. The trains on the provincial railway kept exploding with bright sparks on the wires when they passed by.</p>
<p>I took out a box of Bat brand cigarettes and rubbed six matches before I could light it. I threw the empty cigarette box into the grass and said casually:</p>
<p>"In twenty years, I will come back here to pick it up."</p>
<p>"In thirty years, we will see a rickety old man come back here to pick it up."</p>
<p>Shan, who was always melancholy and taciturn, this time immediately supplemented my words. Again, three laughs mixed together. Again, silence. I saw a pair of bright eyes under Shan's black hair, shining with a melancholic light like the stars in the sky, but the stars were not as close to me as hers.</p>
<p>I know that Shan brought a burden of painful memories from her motherland, and this memory is constantly鞭打 her fragile personality. Under the lone lamp, she whips out the clear tears in her eyes, and in the night wind, she whips out this melancholic light in her eyes.</p>
<p>Yin was also temporarily silent. It should be that she was thinking of the one who, due to the pressure of life, finally had no choice but to leave her alone and drift back to the chaotic and dangerous homeland.</p>
<p>The half-missing moon is regaining its vitality and running in the clouds. What is the mission? Why is she so determined and hasty?</p>
<p>I stood up and threw away the cigarette butt. Oh, the wave of rooftops in the rear just now has now turned into a calm and dark sea, on which the lights of fishing boats are dotted.</p>
<p>We dragged our heavy steps again and walked down the steep hill. Stepping into the narrow alley, we realized that our feet were all strangely itchy. It turned out that some mosquitoes in the grass had covered our feet with small bumps.</p>
<h3>Debt</h3>
<p>— Zi Gang</p>
<p>As people gradually grow older and walk a few more years on the thorny path of life, they feel threatened from all directions.</p>
<p>Especially money; it has become the fuse in all of this. One spark will set off a chain reaction, turning smiles into frowns, squeezing people's hearts tightly, and turning even the fattest person into a skeleton!</p>
<p>I have heard and seen many people locked up by money all their lives. They live in an environment that is not comfortable, accustomed to the sounds of sighs and tears, and these sounds are mostly for money. Yes, money!</p>
<p>Children's understanding of money is vague. The money taken from their mother's pocket can be exchanged for candy, clay figurines, and paper horses to play with... They never think about where the money comes from, and will innocently tell people: "Dad buys clothes, Mom buys socks," when people ask. Their explanation of money is probably the same as exchanging a shuttlecock for ten cigarette cards from a friend.</p>
<p>When they are a little older, they learn to pretend to be aloof and scold everything. From stories, they get the concept that "rich people are always bad," so they scold the rich for being stingy and curse money as evil, as if they grew up drinking the west wind. They never think that they themselves will become the target of everyone's scolding in the future.</p>
<p>These innocent children do not know that they are the debt built by their parents' blood and sweat! What they earn from work is exchanged for the family's food and clothing. When they have to, they go out to ask for credit. As the children grow taller, the parents' backs become hunched and shorter. Don't parents who can't bear the burden of their children often complain and scold about debt collectors?</p>
<p>And many children who bear the name of "debt collectors" just happen to grow up.</p>
<p>For a year, I escaped this name and hung around outside in a carefree manner, busy with my legs and hands, spending relatively peaceful days in the wind and rain. Money came through my fingers and slipped away again. I frowned more than I laughed. I would write down a tab at a small restaurant, relying on my credit to eat free meals for ten days or half a month, hoping for "next month." So the restaurant owner also hoped with me. In these difficult days, I had to make my stomach and legs suffer a little.</p>
<p>Sickness came to bully people.</p>
<p>So I remembered the saying that I used to think was ridiculously shabby: "Poor people get rich people's diseases." The disease was so stubborn, so bullish, constantly缠绕缠绕 with people. Pain pierced through every joint. When the doctor talked about malnutrition, I could only smile wryly. He didn't know how I earned the money I gave to the pharmacy every day. The liquid that was injected into my blood vessels every day floated like a phantom before my eyes, not yellow water, but money, and all the suffering behind it. Long-term injections made my arm swollen, and the needle holes were like a honeycomb. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Hyacinth Bean</h3>
<p>— Luo Hong</p>
<p>In the autumn, the hyacinth beans planted on the fence in our back garden all bloom with flowers; such small, deep purple and light purple flowers. These small flowers grow in clusters on thin branches. They are shaded by green leaves, and although they are not gorgeous, they are very lovely. I love their simple colors, hanging in strings on the fence, decorating the serene autumn colors into a lovely appearance. Those oval hyacinth beans are also deep purple and light purple, hanging in pieces on the fence, even more lovely than those small flowers.</p>
<p>I remember when I was six or seven years old, my mother was cleaning out the closet. Hoping to get something unexpected, I stood next to my mother, unwilling to leave. Later, I found a tall cardboard box in the closet and insisted that my mother open it for me to see. Inside were several hats of various shapes and beautiful colors. I vaguely remember that a few of them were hats that I had worn when I was young. I saw a hat with two things in the front, like small cow horns, sticking out in front. When I shook the hat in my hand, the two solid, curved things trembled, which was very interesting. I asked my mother, and she told me that they were called hyacinth beans.</p>
<p>"Are they the hyacinth beans that we eat, the ones that are cooked oily and soft?" I asked curiously at the time. At that time, in my small heart, I was still wondering how hyacinth beans could be made into hats.</p>
<p>Even now, every year when I see hyacinth beans, I think of my childhood, and childhood is worth remembering!</p>
<p>But every year in the autumn when the hyacinth bean flowers bloom, I feel that my time of leisure has arrived again. I always plan that I should write many articles and read many books because a hot summer has tortured my body and spirit very painfully.</p>
<p>I often walk to the back garden, sit on a large bluestone, and gaze at the blue sky, imagining endlessly. Sometimes I melt into the rural autumn colors without any thoughts. At these times, I feel that my heart is like the velvet-like blue sky, gentle and pure, and I almost forget all my worries and hardships.</p>
<p>Then I look at those deep purple and light small flowers, and the deep purple and light purple hyacinth beans, shaded by the green leaves. It is truly a tranquil autumn color! I love the autumn colors. I watch them tremble in the breeze, and I smile in the breeze.</p>

<h3>The Separation and Combination of Novels and Stories</h3>
<p>— Zhi Ying</p>
<p>In his essay "Balzac's Method," L. Fernandes distinguishes in great detail between the novel (Roman) and the story (Récit). He says: "The novel is the expression of events occurring in time, an expression governed by the conditions of the occurrence and development of these events; the story is the representation of events that occur and end, and the reappearance of these events is determined by the narrator according to the laws of narration and persuasion."</p>
<p>To be more precise, "In the novel, events are happening; conversely, in the story, events have happened and ended. The story is organized around a past, while the novel is organized not in the present tense of the verb, but in the psychological present. The events in the story detach from the effect of time and the place of reality, in other words, they are clothed in the garments of ideas."</p>
<p>It should be stated here that the story mentioned in the above definition should not be confused with the commonly called "story in the novel." Although in reality there is no strict distinction between the novel (Roman) and the story (Récit), they each have their own characteristics. The story is a narration, taking what has passed, been experienced, and ended. It disregards the psychological complexity within, disregards the expression of the character of the bewildering reality development, and the method it uses is a deductive combination. The novel is the opposite; it uses descriptive method, aesthetic proof; while the story uses a general descriptive method, using logical proof.</p>
<p>Take a few examples. "Dream of the Red Chamber" and "Water Margin" have delicate psychological and character descriptions, so they are "novels." Conversely, things like "Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio" and "Biographies of Immortals" are just deductions of "intrigue," which is a "story" rather than a "novel."</p>
<p>Art is a concrete reflection of reality. The richer the concrete image of the work, the more realistic it is, the more it can touch the reader's soul and exert the social function of art. In this regard, the novel is far superior to the story.</p>
<p>In fact, the shortcomings brought by the narrative style of the story are very serious. If we take a look at Boccaccio's "Decameron," we will understand the reason. Some literary historians criticize "Decameron" for lacking concrete psychological and character descriptions and expressions, but this is not necessarily a lack of Boccaccio's artistic talent, but rather because he adopted the narrative form of the story. "One Thousand and One Nights" can also be used as our example.</p>
<p>The life expressed in the novel is the life of the living moment. It should express the twists and turns and rhythms of this life, to the best of its faithful ability. Therefore, Fernandes said, "His (the novelist's) intellect is guided rather than guiding." This sentence is not intentionally trying to obliterate the role of the writer's worldview; no, if we look at how Dostoevsky shared the joys and sorrows of his characters at the time, if we look at how Balzac was fascinated by his characters, we will know that the writer's subjectivity is sometimes actually "being guided." Because the life of the novel is intuition. The so-called intuition means that the novelist does not describe events and characters from the outside, but rather lives in the situation of the novel.</p>
<p>Now, detective novels or romance novels are popular in various countries. They are the lowest-level specimens of stories, in which the reflection of reality is so small that it is almost non-existent. The basis for these things to absorb readers is the same as that of religion absorbing devout believers. In addition, many clumsy and naive works often flow into the "logical" narrative of stories. The characters in them are puppets on a wooden stage, with no emotional shifts, no relationships of life. Therefore, the novel is aesthetic, but the story is an ambiguous thing outside of aesthetics. Moreover, the ideas in the novel are implied or transparently revealed for the sake of concrete expression; but the story is the opposite, using ideas to determine expression, and the expression is more or less绕而行 around abstract ideas.</p>
<p>These two opposite things are skillfully used together by some brilliant artists. According to Fernandes' analysis, Balzac's works are like this. Stendhal's works also have this tendency. Fernandes said that Balzac combined several techniques to construct characters:</p>
<p>(1) Establish the historical identity of placing the character in time and in a certain social group.</p>
<p>(2) Deductive psychology, starting from general concepts and shaping some characteristics of the character's personality.</p>
<p>(3) Not only the appearance, body, and clothes of the character, but also the exclusive visual narration of his daily environment and residence.</p>
<p>Due to this method, Fernandes said, "Balzac's characters are conceived ideas before they become living individuals." He also added the adjective "a priori." At first glance, it seems as if he is saying that what Balzac expresses is only his own ideas, but in fact, this is not the case. Fernandes is only emphasizing the following point: Balzac's works are not works of "dry realism," but rather have realistic and romantic elements in them. Balzac's comprehensive ability to create typical characters comes from what Fernandes said. He said that the character of Balzac's characters "is naturally determined by the part of life being expressed."</p>
<p>Balzac's unification of story and novel is also due to his grand themes. All great writers will never be biased towards one side. For example, Gogol's "Taras Bulba" is a story of melancholy history, and Gorky's "Russian Fairy Tales" are also stories, but these two works are equally excellent novels because they are both the products of the unification of story and novel. This little debate may be of some enlightenment to us.</p>
<h3>The Public Cemetery in the Suburbs</h3>

<p>Here, is the public cemetery in the suburbs,</p>
<p>This place has no triumphant passers-by,</p>
<p>This place has no flourishing flowers and plants;</p>
<p>Only a few wild white poplars,</p>
<p>Swaying in the wind before these ownerless graves.</p>
<p>Blue and white lanterns,</p>
<p>Seem to be the eyes of these ghosts—</p>
<p>Unfamiliar souls,</p>
<p>Do you have anything unsaid</p>
<p>Left behind after death to complain to the world?</p>
<p>How many lonely lives are buried here?</p>
<p>How pitiful their lives are!</p>
<p>In the thousands of people,</p>
<p>In the end, they cannot find a reliable companion.</p>
<p>Or a wandering and missing teenager,</p>
<p>Or an old man of the rivers and lakes,</p>
<p>Or a mute, an idiot, or a straggling soldier...</p>
<p>In short, they are an unfortunate group.</p>
<p>They live in solitude,</p>
<p>Until the day of death;</p>
<p>Until the day of death,</p>
<p>Buried together by strangers</p>
<p>Is considered compensation for their life's misery.</p>

<h3>Business Conditions and Telecommunications</h3>
<p>— Zhen</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Abyssinian Crisis, the international market has been in a state of flux. On the Japanese stock market, from August 1st to September 1st, the total increase in the value of such stocks reached a huge 90,000 yuan. Especially on September 18th, the Tokyo stock market presented a sudden surge, and the prices of leading stocks soared by six or seven yuan in one day, breaking the record of fifty years. China's international trade relies heavily on exports such as silk, tea, and minerals. Since the start of the Italo-Ethiopian War, the market has been unusually brisk. The price of Guangdong-produced mineral sand, which was only six yuan per hundred catties a few days ago, has now risen to twenty yuan. Raw silk has risen to more than thirty-five cents per tael, nearly one-third more than the previous month, and the market price of green tea has risen by five yuan per chest. It can be seen that the ups and downs of current business conditions are naturally related to international economics and politics. Under these complex circumstances, business operators must not only possess commercial knowledge but also pay attention to market news.</p>
<p>The so-called market news not only requires knowing the prices of various commodities but also using the current situation to predict future trends. The level of commodity prices depends on the supply and demand of the international market, its changes are very rapid, and its benefits are very great. However, if one is ignorant of the times and neglects opportunities, one will never be able to obtain even one-tenth of the profit. Therefore, those who are well-informed are the key to winning and achieving success.</p>
<p>To obtain timely information, the closest thing is to use the telephone, and the furthest is to use the telegraph, especially using the telephone to send and receive telegrams. The function of the telegraph is to secretly report business conditions, and the function of the telephone is to discuss transactions in the local area or neighboring areas. However, international news changes rapidly, and telegram communication is faster and better. Therefore, using the telephone to send and receive telegrams eliminates the trouble of messengers running around. After registering with the local telegraph office, one can transmit telegrams by telephone in the office, and the message reaches its destination in a few minutes, which is the fastest way to communicate.</p>
<p>Military strategists say: "Know yourself and know your enemy, and you will win every battle," and "Planning strategies in the tent determines victory a thousand miles away," and "Be as still as a virgin, move like a fleeing rabbit." This is knowledge of strategy. How is it different in business? Military strategists obtain information from all sides to determine their strategy of advance, retreat, attack, and defense, just as business people obtain information from all places to determine their plan of entry, exit, collection, and release. Therefore, the planning of great business people is not in the current prosperity of the store, but in manipulating the future needs of society. If one does not use telecommunications to transmit information, even if there is a great opportunity, one will miss it. Moreover, under unfavorable economic conditions and fierce competition, maintaining the status quo is also impossible.</p>
<p>Business people with foresight will not miss this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity amidst the international situation and will not abandon the sharp weapon of timely information! Telecommunications must be used.</p>
<h3>Results of Domestic Telegraph Price Reduction</h3>
<p>— Hao</p>
<p>In order to understand the trend of domestic telegraph services and the rise and fall of various services, the Telecommunications Department of the Ministry of Transportation compiles a domestic telegraph statistics chart every year. Recently, the compilation for 1934 has been completed. After reading it, the reporter has a general understanding of the domestic telegraph services in 1934 and writes down his thoughts to inform those who care about the telecommunications industry.</p>
<p>The development of all undertakings is related to the stability of the political situation, and the telecommunications industry cannot be an exception. Since the completion of the Northern Expedition in 1928 and the realization of unification, social order has been relatively stable, so all industries and businesses have a thriving outlook. Unfortunately, since 1931, externally, there have been the incidents in Shandong Province and Shanghai, and internally, there have been disasters of floods, droughts, soldiers, and bandits. Disasters have spread everywhere, and vitality has been greatly damaged, which has caused merchants to hesitate and the market to be depressed. Domestic telegraph services have also been greatly affected in connection. Look at the following comparative table of the number of domestic telegrams and the number of words from 1928 to 1934, and it will be clear:</p>
<p>Year | Number of Telegrams | Number of Words</p>
<p>------- | -------- | --------</p>
<p>1928 | 3,261,905 | 136,562,277</p>
<p>1929 | 3,451,890 | 141,866,884</p>
<p>1930 | 3,600,203 | 155,019,244</p>
<p>1931 | 3,449,381 | 162,519,743</p>
<p>1932 | 3,047,574 | 148,063,609</p>
<p>1933 | 3,868,238 | 133,537,464</p>
<p>1934 | 3,276,861 | 135,595,933</p>
<p>The table above shows that domestic telegraph services increased year by year from 1928 to 1930, and then decreased year by year from 1931 to 1933. All of this is enough to prove that the prosperity and decline of telegraph services are closely related to the safety and danger of the current situation and are mutually influential. However, the domestic situation in 1934 was not better than in the past, but domestic telegraph services increased instead. What is the reason for this? This is due to the large reduction in domestic telegraph prices. Before 1934, the recipient's name and address of domestic telegrams had to be charged by the word, and the telegraph fee was too high, and the public's burden was too heavy. Since January 1, 1934, the recipient's name and address within fifteen words were generally charged as five words, and the telegraph price was greatly reduced, so the public used telegrams more often. Conversely, if the domestic telegraph fees in 1934 still followed the old rules and were not reduced, the domestic services in 1934 would inevitably be more miserable than in the past. This can be asserted. Furthermore, since the price reduction of domestic telegrams, from January to December 1934, ordinary telegrams increased from 180,000 times per month to 230,000 times. This is also due to the gradual prevalence of price reduction propaganda. Knowing this, the increase in domestic telegrams in 1934 was not accidental.</p>
<p>As for express telegrams, the more the service improves, the fewer the number of times. After the service improves, the rate of ordinary telegrams will be improved accordingly, and the public will naturally have fewer opportunities to need express telegrams. In the past year, the reform of telegraph services has been particularly numerous compared with previous years, and the adoption of new telegraph machines such as the Kleet re-engraving machine and the telegraph typewriter was also a matter of the past year. Under these circumstances, the improvement of the telegraph rate is inevitable. In theory, the number of express telegrams will inevitably decrease. However, according to statistics, the total number of express telegrams in the past year was 82,300 times, an increase of 2,083 times compared with 80,317 times in 1933. The reason for this is that the express telegram fee was changed from three times to two times the regular fee, which is the so-called "profiting from more." All of this is enough to prove the success of the telegraph price reduction policy, and the authorities' ability to resolutely implement it at that time was indeed far-sighted.</p>
<p>As for the number of words sent in 1934, at first glance, it seems to have decreased compared with previous years in proportion. In fact, the number of words in 1934 was calculated according to the number of words charged. If the actual number of words in the recipient's name and address is calculated, the number of words will be more than in 1932 and 1933, which is undoubtedly. Moreover, the reduction in the public's cost of sending telegrams is indeed not a small amount!</p>
<h3>The Control of Telegraphing Weather Reports</h3>
<p>— By Lian</p>
<p>Wind, rain, clouds, and fog are ever-changing; dryness, humidity, overcast skies, and clear weather are constantly in flux. Navigation, aviation, agriculture, and animal husbandry are all closely related to the weather. Therefore, to ensure safe navigation, a bountiful harvest, and flourishing livestock, it is essential to anticipate weather changes and prepare accordingly. To accurately predict future weather, it is necessary to gather weather reports from various locations. The transmission of these reports must be precise and rapid, hence the importance of weather telegraphs.</p>
<p>Weather telegraphs are valuable tools for transmitting weather reports from different locations. Swiftness is paramount in delivery, thus weather telegraphs in Eastern and Western countries are generally prioritized over public and private telegrams. The various telegraph offices in our country have always highly valued weather telegraphs. However, in recent years, the number of weather-related organizations in the country has been increasing. Due to a lack of a unified system and designated central points, these telegraphs have become increasingly numerous, transmitted back and forth without limits. This not only greatly impacts the operations of the telegraph offices, but also diminishes the effectiveness of weather telegraphs. In April of this year, the Ministry of Transportation, in order to streamline the operations of telegraph offices and control the transmission of weather telegraphs, proposed a method for regional broadcasting of weather telegraphs. This was presented at a joint conference of national weather organizations, where the principles were approved. Subsequently, the Department of Telegraph Administration of the Ministry of Transportation and the Institute of Meteorology of the Academia Sinica agreed on detailed measures, which have been implemented since July 1st. A summary of these measures is listed below:</p>
<p>The country is divided into five regions, with the telegraph offices in Shanghai, Hankou, Tianjin, Chang'an, and Guangzhou serving as the central points for weather telegraphs in their respective regions. Weather telegraphs within each region can only be sent to the regional central telegraph office. Each office will then broadcast the reports via wireless radio at specified times, twice a day, once in the morning and once in the afternoon. The Central Meteorological Institute will collect the weather broadcasts from the central offices of each region and then broadcast a national weather report via wireless radio.</p>
<p>More than three months have passed since the implementation of these measures. The effects can be summarized as follows:</p>
<p>1. Reduction in the Number of Telegraphs: Before the implementation of regional broadcasting, weather telegraphs were sent back and forth, often with considerable redundancy. For example, a weather telegraph sent by the Wuhu Customs Office would be sent not only to the Central Meteorological Institute in Nanjing, but also to the Shandong Provincial Weather Observatory, among other places. Moreover, multiple organizations in one location might send weather telegraphs. With the new measures, each location can only have one organization sending weather telegraphs, and these can only be sent to the central telegraph office in their region, thus eliminating redundancy. As of the end of June of this year, the Ministry had issued over 150 weather telegraph permits. Since the implementation of the new measures on July 1st, this number has been reduced to just over 70. Assuming each permit allows for two telegrams per day, this represents a daily reduction of over 150 weather telegrams, a decrease of more than 50%.</p>
<p>2. Reduction in Distance Between Sending and Receiving Locations: China is vast, and the distances between sending and receiving locations for weather telegraphs were previously unrestricted, often resulting in very long distances. This meant that transmission often took too long to be of use to the receiving organizations. With the implementation of controlled measures, weather telegraphs within each region can only be sent to the central telegraph office in that region for broadcasting, thereby shortening the distance between sending and receiving locations. For example, telegraphs from Gui Sui, previously sent to Nanjing, now only need to be sent to Tianjin; those from Lanzhou, previously sent to Qingdao, now only need to be sent to Chang'an; and those from Cangwu, previously sent to Jinan, now only need to be sent to Guangzhou. Telegraphs from Shanghai, Tianjin, Hankou, Chang'an, and Guangzhou to other locations within the country only need to be delivered to the local telegraph office for broadcasting, eliminating the need for multiple transfers. How convenient is that?</p>
<p>3. Savings in Labor, Materials, and Time: With the number of weather telegraphs reduced by more than 50%, there is a corresponding reduction in labor and materials. Moreover, according to the new regulations, weather telegrams delayed for more than 24 hours due to line or equipment issues are to be stopped altogether. This is because such telegrams are no longer timely and would only waste labor and materials and clog up the telegraph lines. Regarding the transmission time of weather telegraphs, the reduction in distance between sending and receiving locations and the simplification of procedures have also resulted in a reduction in time. For example, a weather telegraph from Cangwu to Nanjing used to take several tens of minutes or even over an hour. Now that it is sent to Guangzhou, it can arrive in a matter of minutes, a tremendous saving of time.</p>
<p>4. Increased Effectiveness of Weather Telegraphs: Although the number of weather telegraphs has been reduced by more than half, their effectiveness has actually increased due to the reduction in distance between sending and receiving locations, the simplification of procedures, and the reduction in time. This is because weather telegraphs within each region, except for those from a few remote locations, can generally be transmitted to the regional central telegraph office for broadcasting within two hours of observation, without loss of timeliness. Any organization that needs weather information from a particular location or region only needs to have equipment to receive the broadcast and can simultaneously receive weather telegraphs broadcast by the central telegraph offices of each region. In other words, it is now possible to receive national weather reports, which is a significant improvement over previously receiving weather reports from only a corner or a few locations. Furthermore, in the past, telegraph offices treated all weather telegraphs, both timely and outdated, the same due to the abuse in the number of telegrams received. After the implementation of the new measures, the number has been reduced, and there are designated routes, so special attention is paid to transmission to prevent delays and ensure swift delivery to the regional central telegraph office for timely broadcasting. This is also a major reason for the increased effectiveness of weather communications.</p>
<p>Although the results of controlling weather telegraph transmission are as described above, it is not certain whether the current regional broadcasting method can be sustained in the long term. The broadcasting time of each regional central telegraph office is limited, and the number of telegrams cannot increase without limit. Weather organizations should carefully consider when applying for telegraph permits and avoid applying indiscriminately if it is not necessary. If a weather report is already being sent from a nearby location in a particular region, it may not be necessary to send another telegram to avoid redundancy. All weather organizations in the country should have effective communication and cooperation, working together as a unified whole, so that the future of domestic weather communication may be promising.</p>
<h3>The Significance of the Ministry of Transportation Promulgating Regulations for the Review of Private Wireless Telegraph Training Schools</h3>
<p>— By Song</p>
<p>Since their use in practical communication, shortwave wireless telegraphs have gained popularity due to their simple equipment and broad utility. Individuals who disregard national laws often establish their own radio stations and hire radio operators to work there. The detrimental effects of this range from disrupting mining telecommunications on a small scale to disturbing social order on a large scale, cases which have been investigated and prosecuted by the Ministry of Transportation with rewards offered. However, the fundamental solution lies in the training of wireless personnel, and the supervision of wireless schools is key to personnel training. Based on this principle, the Ministry of Transportation, in consultation with the Ministry of Education, formulated a set of regulations for the review of private wireless telegraph training schools, which were promulgated on October 7th. The contents are outlined below:</p>
<p>(1) Regarding Training: Training schools may establish separate communication and engineering classes. The duration of study should be at least ten months for the communication class and at least fifteen months for the engineering class (calculated based on actual instruction time). With such a significant period of training, students will be able to perform their duties effectively. The admission requirements are a junior high school diploma for the communication class and a senior high school diploma for the engineering class. With admission requirements in place, the average student level will be raised, and incompetent individuals will not be able to succeed. The curriculum for training schools should include the following compulsory subjects: 1. Principles of Electricity, 2. Wireless Telegraphy, 3. Telecommunications Regulations, 4. Wireless Engineering, 5. Telegraph Transmission and Reception, 6. Principles of Prime Movers, 7. Typing, 8. Wireless Machine Installation and Repair, 9. World Geography and Telegraph Lines, 10. Code Translation. The above subjects are the main courses for the engineering and communication classes, respectively.</p>
<p>(2) Regarding Supervision: Training schools must first be approved for establishment by the local education authorities and then submitted to the Ministry of Education for review by the Ministry of Transportation, and for record by the Ministry of Transportation at the Ministry of Military Affairs. Those that have not been registered with the Ministry of Education and reviewed by the Ministry of Transportation may, depending on the circumstances, be closed down upon request to the Ministry of Education. The teaching time for the specified subjects and the teaching materials should be submitted to the Ministry of Education for review by the Ministry of Transportation, and the Ministry of Transportation may send personnel to inspect them when necessary. Student performance at the end of the training period should be submitted to the Ministry of Transportation for review. If the Ministry of Transportation considers the performance to be unsatisfactory, it may request the Ministry of Education to order improvements or revoke its registration. Under the supervision of the Ministries of Education, Transportation, and Military Affairs, those who operate wireless telegraph training schools for profit will have nowhere to hide.</p>
<p>(3) Regarding Student Benefits: Training schools will be strictly reviewed, and those that are poorly managed will be ordered to improve, or their registration will be revoked or not approved. This will distinguish between the good and the bad, and those seeking education will be able to make informed choices. All required subjects are specified, and classes are taught on time, completing the curriculum on a monthly basis. Knowledge and skills in telecommunications will be firmly established, and with self-study, students will be able to obtain high-level jobs. Therefore, students holding certificates of qualification from the Ministry of Transportation will be allowed to take the examinations for telegraph operators and mechanics when the Ministry of Transportation holds them. In other words, those who do not hold the aforementioned certificates will not be allowed to take the examinations. In other words, those who do not attend a wireless telegraph training school approved by the Ministry of Transportation will not be able to obtain a suitable job.</p>
<p>The significance of the Ministry of Transportation's formulation of these review regulations is (1) to support wireless telegraph education, (2) to cultivate specialized wireless telegraph talent, (3) to unify wireless telegraph management authority, and (4) to prevent the abuse of wireless communication as a tool for crime. At a time when the state is in crisis, wireless communication is closely related to military affairs and should be given close attention.</p>
<h3>Key Tips for Saving Money on Sending Chinese Telegrams Abroad</h3>
<p>— By Qinghua</p>
<p>Telegrams sent abroad are much more expensive than domestic telegrams, costing at least six or seven cents per word and as much as three or four yuan. Therefore, senders must understand the tips for saving money in order to avoid excessive telegraph fees and be economical. Below are two tips for saving money:</p>
<p>(1) Methods for Saving Money on Sending Chinese Telegrams to Japan (including Korea and Taiwan): Each Chinese character in a telegram must be represented by four numerical codes. For domestic telegrams, each character costs one cent, which is half the price of foreign-language telegrams at two cents per word. However, for international telegrams, the price is the same regardless of whether it is in Chinese or a foreign language, which is clearly a disadvantage. However, when dealing with urgent matters, it is necessary to send a telegram, and those who do not understand a foreign language have no choice but to send a Chinese telegram. This is very painful for people with financial difficulties! However, since the Shanghai International Radio Station and the Tokyo Radio Station in Japan began communicating, a special preferential Chinese telegram service has been opened. There are two special features to its billing method: (1) The name and address of the recipient and the place name of the recipient are counted as only one character. (2) The telegram text is charged at one character for every seven numerical codes. Let's take an example below:</p>
<p>東京淸水叮二番李鴻元母病危速歸</p>
<p>(Tokyo, 2nd block, Shimizu Town, Li Hongyuan, mother critically ill, return quickly)</p>
<p>If the above telegram were sent as a normal Chinese telegram, it would be charged as fourteen characters (the two characters 東京, Tokyo, are the place name of the recipient and are counted as only one character). At the current price of seven cents per word (limited to those sent from Shanghai), the telegram fee would be ninety-one cents and eight cents. If the five characters "mother critically ill, return quickly" (母病危速歸) in the telegram text, which are twenty numerical codes, are written consecutively on specially made telegram paper, then they will be charged as three characters, because according to the regulations, every seven numerical codes are counted as only one character. The remaining "Tokyo, 2nd block, Shimizu Town, Li Hongyuan" (東京淸水叮二番李鴻元), which is one character, is counted as one character, so the telegram is only charged for four characters, costing only two cents and eight cents. Isn't it surprisingly cheap to save more than seven cents on one telegram? I think very few of our compatriots in Japan and our fellow citizens in the country know about this money-saving method! However, this preferential Chinese telegram service is limited to telegrams sent between Shanghai and Japan and must be transmitted through the Shanghai International Radio Station. If you send a telegram to a water-line telegraph office, you will not receive this preferential benefit.</p>
<p>(2) Methods for Saving Money on Sending Chinese Telegrams to Other Countries: It has already been said above that the price of sending Chinese telegrams to foreign countries is the same as for foreign-language telegrams, and the telegram fee is much more expensive. Therefore, the Ministry of Transportation has newly compiled a Roman alphabet telegraph code to facilitate communication between overseas Chinese and their motherland. This code uses three letters to represent one Chinese character. For example, the code BZI represents the character "國" (country). When sending a telegram, completely translate the Chinese characters in the telegram text into Roman alphabet codes according to the "New Telegraph Code" published by the Ministry of Transportation. For example, the five characters "货到欵速汇" (goods arrived, remit payment quickly) are translated into the following codes: Raoarij huss sgiaut. Then, connect these five codes to become Raoarjhussgiavt, and then divide these five codes into groups of five letters as follows: Raoar jhuss giavt. According to international telegraph regulations, these three groups of codes are charged as only three characters and are calculated at 60% of the normal price. Therefore, if the original five Chinese characters are translated into the ordinary four-code five groups, assuming the price is two yuan per word, you should pay ten yuan for the telegram fee. After changing to three groups of foreign-language codes, you only need to pay three yuan and six cents for the telegram fee, which can save 64% of the telegram fee. Isn't it also very surprising?</p>
<p>Ordinary people know very little about the two money-saving methods mentioned above, so I specially bring them up, hoping that overseas and domestic compatriots can use these two methods to save a lot of money! Finally, I have to add one more sentence: that is, when sending the two types of Chinese telegrams mentioned above, you must contact the other party in advance to clarify, otherwise, the other party will definitely be confused and unable to translate when they receive it. As for readers who still have questions, please send a letter to this newspaper office, and we will answer you in detail.</p>
<h3>Reduction in British Telegram Rates</h3>
<p>— Reporter</p>
<p>British telegram rates have been significantly reduced since June 1st. Ordinary telegrams with less than nine words will be charged only six pence, and for each additional word, one penny will be charged.</p>
<p>Prior to the price reduction, each telegram with no more than twelve words cost one shilling, and each additional word cost one penny. This was the price since 1920. Before the European War, the price for these twelve words was six pence, which increased to nine pence during the war.</p>
<h3>The Benefits of Sending Telegrams</h3>
<p>— By Mei Maoheng</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen: The majority of the people in our country do not know what telecommunications is. Today, I would like to cite a few facts that I have heard to you: (1) Mr. Zhao's friend was very ill. He thought of going to Shanghai to invite a famous doctor to treat his friend, but because he did not know how to use rapid telegrams, he actually ran to Shanghai himself to invite the doctor. Naturally, for a very seriously ill patient, delaying treatment by even a minute or a second has a great impact, so before he could invite the doctor back, his friend was beyond saving. (2) Mr. Qian had a lot of savings in a Shanghai money shop. He suddenly heard the news that the money shop was about to go bankrupt. He did not send a telegram to urge the special payment to be remitted. Later, the money shop went bankrupt, and he suffered a bad debt. (3) Mr. Sun received a wedding invitation from a friend, and when he looked at the date, it was too late to send a congratulatory gift. He could not think of any way to celebrate, so he was impolite. (4) Mr. Li's son was studying abroad. One day, he received a letter from him, knowing that he was ill. As a father, he was naturally very anxious, but how to know the true condition of his son's illness? In addition to writing a quick letter to inquire, he did not know any other way to get a reply immediately.</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, think about it, how pitiful were the four gentlemen mentioned above! If they knew how to use telecommunications, (1) Mr. Zhao wanted to go to Shanghai to invite a famous doctor, he could have sent an urgent telegram or made an urgent phone call to invite him, why did he have to run to Shanghai himself? Then, his friend might have had hope of being saved because the doctor arrived several hours earlier. (2) Mr. Qian heard that the money shop was about to go bankrupt, he could have immediately sent a telegram to urge them to remit the payment, why would he have lost everything? (3) Mr. Sun's friend's wedding date had arrived and it was too late to send a gift, he could have sent a social telegram to congratulate them, wouldn't it have been economical and thoughtful? (4) Mr. Li's son was sick abroad, it would have been even easier to know his condition. Now our Ministry of Transportation's international radio station has direct communication circuits with major countries. If he sent a telegram to inquire, he could get a reply within a few hours, avoiding worrying about it all the time. How many other invisible losses have been suffered because people have not used telecommunications, thus delaying news and missing opportunities?</p>
<p>Regarding the introduction of common sense about telecommunications services, the Shanghai Shen Bao has a special telecommunications publication published on the 1st and 16th of each month, providing as much introduction and introduction as possible, you can read it on time. There are also telecommunications business inspectors specially dispatched by various local telegraph offices to promote to all walks of life at any time. The Ministry of Transportation still believes that this is not enough, and has ordered local telegraph offices to conduct public telecommunications business broadcasting promotions on local radio stations from August, so that everyone can understand what telecommunications is? How to use telecommunications? No longer like the four gentlemen I mentioned earlier, how pitiful!</p>
<h3>A Brief Account of the Newly Revised Domestic Telegraph Business Regulations (Continued from Previous)</h3>
<p>— By Baozhen</p>
<p>(5) Methods for various special services, such as "verification" and "distribution," do not apply uniformly to all types of telegrams. The new regulations specifically list the various types of telegrams to which the various special service methods do not apply in a table (see page 38 of the Domestic Telegraph Business Regulations). The sender can easily look up the table and know that a certain type of telegram cannot use a certain special service method, which is quite simple.</p>
<p>(6) Regarding the conditions and procedures for refunding telegram fees, the new regulations are quite detailed and have been greatly increased and revised compared to the old regulations. The following is a brief summary of the main points:</p>
<p>(A) If the sender requests to cancel the telegram before it has been sent, the telegraph office shall refund the entire fee in full. However, if the telegram has already been sent and a paid public telegram is used to cancel it, the fee cannot be refunded.</p>
<p>(B) If the telegraph office has not sent the telegram delivered by the sender to the destination, or the receiving telegraph office has not delivered the telegram to the recipient, or if the name of the sending telegraph office is sent incorrectly during transmission, resulting in the loss of the telegram's effectiveness, or if the telegram is delayed due to errors in the telegraph office's operations, such as if the time required for the sender to send the telegram from the time it is delivered to the time it is delivered to the recipient is later than the time required for airmail or postal delivery (in places where airmail or express mail is available, the time required for airmail or express mail shall prevail), or if errors or omissions in the text of the telegram cause the meaning of the entire telegram to be changed or unintelligible, and if the content of the telegram sent by the sender is deemed by the telegraph office to require suspension of transmission, the telegraph office shall refund the entire fee for the telegram.</p>
<p>(C) If a word or number is omitted or incorrect, or if a paid sign of a certain special service is omitted, the telegraph office shall refund the fee for each omitted or incorrect word, or the surcharge for the special service (such as the copying fee or verification fee) and the one-word fee for the paid service sign. However, if the telegraph office has already discovered the error and corrected it with a paid public telegram within the aforementioned airmail or postal time limit, the original telegram fee will not be refunded. However, the paid public telegram notifying the correction will not be charged to the original sender.</p>
<p>(D) The telegraph office shall not be responsible for refunding the fee if the telegram is delayed due to inspection or if a portion of the telegram text is deleted.</p>
<p>(E) If the sender or recipient has doubts about the telegram sent or received and does not request the telegraph office to send a paid public telegram on their behalf in accordance with the regulations, but sends a telegram directly to correct or inquire, the fee for all the aforementioned correction or inquiry telegrams will not be refunded, regardless of whether the original telegram contained errors.</p>
<p>(F) If a prepaid reply voucher is not used or accepted by the recipient, the sender may apply for a refund within three months. If the recipient uses the voucher to pay for the reply telegram fee and there is an odd amount of more than four cents in silver dollars, it may also be refunded. If the prepaid reply fee is included in the telegram, and the telegraph office approves a refund due to errors, all prepaid reply fees will be refunded. At the same time, if the reply telegram sent by the recipient using the prepaid reply fee is invalid due to operational errors of the telegraph office, the telegraph office shall refund the prepaid reply fee together with the original telegram fee to the original sender. The aforementioned application for a refund shall be made within six months from the date the voucher was issued, and will not be accepted after the deadline.</p>
<p>(G) If the coastal radio station notifies the original sending telegraph office that it cannot send the telegram to the ship's radio station, the sending telegraph office shall automatically refund the coastal fee and ship fee for the telegram to the sender, but the land telegraph station fee for a portion of the telegram will not be refunded. (Note: The ship's radio telegram fee includes the land telegraph station fee, coastal fee, and ship fee, which are internally divided by the relevant bureaus and stations).</p>
<p>Applications for other refund items, except for the prepaid reply fee, which shall be handled in accordance with the special provisions mentioned above, and the ship's radio telegram, which shall be refunded automatically by the original sending telegraph office, shall be made within six months from the date the original telegram was delivered, and will not be processed after the deadline.</p>
<p>(7) The new regulations contain detailed provisions on the retention period of telegraph originals and the procedures for submitting and delivering telegraph originals. The telegraph office shall retain the original telegrams and related documents for 20 months, starting from the month following the delivery of the telegram. Once the original telegram has been delivered to the telegraph office, it may not be retrieved under any circumstances. However, within the aforementioned retention period, the sender, recipient, or their representative of the original telegram, after proving their identity, shall have the right to request to inspect the original telegram or its copy. A fee of four cents shall be paid for each inspection, but the original telegram or copy may not be taken outside the telegraph office. Within the specified retention period, the sender, recipient, or their entrusted person may request the telegraph office to send a copy of the original telegram, or to provide a photograph of the original telegram. The fees are as follows: (A) For sending a copy of the original telegram, the copying fee is four cents for each copy not exceeding one hundred words. For each additional fifty words, an additional two cents shall be charged, and if it is less than fifty words, it shall also be calculated as fifty words. (B) For providing a photograph of the original telegram, in addition to charging the photography fee according to the price set by the photography studio entrusted by the telegraph office, a handling fee of five cents shall be charged for each copy. The above measures not only provide considerable convenience for the sender and recipient, but also help protect legal interests.</p>
<p>The above is just a brief summary of the main points of the new regulations. From now on, with clear and comprehensive regulations for both the sender and recipient and the telegraph office to follow together, the relationship between each other should become closer, which is also an important facility for improving the telegraph business. (End)</p>
<h3>A Telegram Saves a Life</h3>
<p>— Ying</p>
<p>This is a disaster that was published in the local news columns of the major newspapers in Shanghai on September 4th of this year. It is now transcribed below:</p>
<p>"The Taikoo Company's New Peking, set sail from Shanghai to Ningbo at 5:00 PM on August 30th. After the ship left Wusongkou, the ship's radio suddenly received a telegram from the Shanghai coastal radio station, stating that a young woman, Ms. He Qi, was on board the ship attempting suicide, please pay attention, etc. The ship's captain immediately ordered the stewards to inquire in detail in each cabin. In official cabin number seventeen, there was indeed a single young female passenger who appeared to be quite depressed. The steward, Wang A-yuan, who was in charge of the room, asked and found out that she was Ms. He Qi, and immediately took care of her. The next day, she was returned to Shanghai and handed over to her family. It is reported that the young woman is only 26 years old and from Yuyao. Her husband and family are all doing business in Shanghai. She was scolded by her husband for a trivial matter, so she took her own life."</p>
<p>Editor's note: Ms. He Qi was saved from an unjust death entirely thanks to the ship's telegram! If the sender had not known how to use the ship's telegram, then Ms. He Qi would have "joined the company of the god of the sea"! Members of society who want to know the news of relatives and friends on ships, or people on ships who want to communicate with relatives and friends on land, using ship telegrams is the most wonderful method. The above news is just an example!</p>

<h3>Save the Middle School Students</h3>
<p>— Meng Ruo</p>
<p>Recently, some people have voiced their concern over the excessive study time in middle schools, fearing students are becoming overwhelmed. Out of concern for the youth, they've called for "saving the middle school students," advocating for immediate reform. I agree with this sentiment, but I believe abolishing the qualifying exams is also of utmost urgency if we want to save today's middle school students.</p>
<p>We acknowledge that qualifying exams aren't entirely without merit. At the very least, they can urge middle school students to pay attention to some basic subjects. However, the extent of their negative effects, I believe, was unforeseen by their proponents. Since their implementation, they have wasted an immeasurable amount of student energy. There are certainly many middle school students who have suffered from the qualifying exams.</p>
<p>First, let's consider the errors in the schools' approaches. To compete for prestige, middle schools often resort to a "crash course" method, increasing students' workload and forcing them to study harder to cope. Knowledge, however, is best acquired through consistent accumulation, not something that can be achieved in a short time. But for the sake of the qualifying exams, schools disregard everything else and simply tell students to cram. Those weak in math cram math; those lacking in history cram history. They fear not filling the students' gaps, without considering whether the students have enough energy. In this situation, schools focus all their efforts on the qualifying exams, neglecting the other training that students deserve. This is truly a distorted form of education.</p>
<p>Secondly, the students themselves, since the qualifying exam is an unavoidable hurdle, preparing for it becomes their sole focus. If schools want them to cram, they have no choice but to cram. The already heavy middle school curriculum already makes students complain, and adding more work makes it even harder to cope. Besides cramming, they must also read exam guides to take shortcuts. In this way, students may be working hard, but what do they get in the end? Useless garbage.</p>
<p>I also want to join others in shouting: "Save the middle school students!"</p>
<h3>Child and Medicine</h3>
<p>— Tianshe</p>
<p>Returning to my residence, weary, I saw my wife sitting like a shadow on a low bamboo stool under the dim light of the fifteen-watt bulb at the top of the stairs. She was listening to the boiling sounds of the medicine pot, accompanied by the chirping of insects from the wall. A gust of late-season night wind sneaked in through the broken slats of the balcony door. Her bangs were disheveled, and a smudge of charcoal ash stained her pale forehead. The buttons on her collar were undone. Her hardship and exhaustion were deeper than mine. I almost wanted to kneel before her and say a thousand words of heartfelt thanks, or let her punish me however she wished, punish me for neglecting the family, neglecting our son's illness, neglecting her increasingly weak body…</p>
<p>But my wife remained gentle, telling me about taking our child to the Chinese Medicine Hospital today. She said she was subjected to some insulting words. Her face showed distress mixed with resentment, but she spoke to me with restraint: "That young doctor felt Xiaoling's pulse and said Xiaoling had a congenital poison, inherited from either the father or the mother. What kind of people does he think we are? Scoundrels! Prostitutes! He looks down on poor families who can't afford famous doctors. How angry I was! But hoping that the child would get better with this charity treatment costing only two jiao for the consultation fee, I had to suppress my anger and explain to him. At first, she had sores, and then she developed pus-filled boils all over her body after eating salted fish. He nodded, seemingly unconvinced. The other patients all looked at me and Xiaoling with even more distressed eyes. I took the medicine and almost ran away."</p>
<p>Although I couldn't help feeling upset after hearing this, I could only comfort my wife and say: "What does it matter if you suffer such injustice from the doctor? Those who seek free medical care are often looked down upon. As long as we maintain our integrity, that's all that matters. Besides, in this dog-eat-dog world, even prostitutes and scoundrels aren't necessarily all willing to be depraved!"</p>
<p>I ran into the room. Xiaoling was sleeping soundly on the army cot, his cheeks covered with yellow ointment, almost hiding his eyes. Yellow, sticky liquid flowed to his tender little ears and onto the embroidered little pillow. Coarse and hurried breaths came from his small nostrils. His thin, pale red lips were closed. His pale forehead and pale, tender arms stretched out from under the quilt. He had been sickly since birth, and he had taken all the "miraculous" infant medications advertised (those we could afford). Alas, must an innocent child also suffer such unkind treatment in this world?</p>
<p>When my wife woke him with a gentle voice and brought the black medicinal soup to his thin, pale red lips, he, as usual, cried and refused to taste the bitter concoction. My wife couldn't help but get angry: "Little one, won't you eat it? Your mother endured resentment to get this medicine for you, and you won't eat it? The sickness is in your body; your mother can't eat it for you." But poor Xiaoling pushed the medicine bowl away with his little hands, crying.</p>
<p>The woman from Hubei on the floor above was grumbling again. She disliked my son's crying. She didn't like my son, saying he was dirty because he was sick. We were used to such cold looks, and I didn't expect sympathy from others. Xiaoling finally cried himself to exhaustion. My wife told me to hold him in my arms and spoon-feed him the medicine. Although he was still crying and still pushing away with his small hands, the medicine flowed "glug, glug, glug..." into his throat. I wiped the yellow liquid from his ears, gently bouncing him and saying:</p>
<p>"Child, be good, swallow this bitter water. Mom loves you, and Dad loves you too!"</p>
<h3>Cremation Ground</h3>
<p>— Conglong</p>
<p>After six o'clock, the sun, weary from its long journey, gathered its scorching light and sank lazily behind the lush coconut grove, carrying its fatigue. At this time, most people had finished their busy and heavy work for the day, eaten dinner, washed off the greasy, sweaty bodies, taken a refreshing breath, and stepped out of the shops, onto the streets, to the seaside, theaters, cafes…wandering about. As a result, the streets became lively again, like a morning market, people squeezing together, mouths open, revealing shiny black teeth, talking, chatting, laughing.</p>
<p>In the hazy atmosphere, the "angmai lan" (bronze drum) sounds faintly echoed, mixed with wooden instruments and unknown local music. Sometimes, it was also accompanied by a chaotic wave of voices, transmitted to people's ears from afar. These low, urgent sounds told people without thinking that a funeral was being held at the cremation ground again.</p>
<p>In Nanyang, the custom (except for those who do not believe in Buddhism, Islam, and Christianity) is to send all dead people to the cremation ground for cremation. They are not accustomed to conducting burials. They believe that after the deceased's body is burned, his clean and holy soul will immediately ascend to the happy paradise. This is the same as the empty and illusory saying of the buried: "Entering the earth and finding peace." I remember once, when I was living in Siam, I happened to go to the cremation ground with a friend to watch people hold a cremation ceremony. The two demons, dressed in frightening green faces and fangs, holding huge tin forks, stabbed the dead person again and again in hatred. The deceased sat up from the fire as soon as he was burned. This terrifying phenomenon was deeply imprinted in my mind. At that time, this terrifying impression disturbed me so much that I couldn't sleep peacefully for several nights. Later, as soon as I smelled the difficult and smoky smell from the cremation ground, the green-faced, fanged demons would come to life in my mind, and my heart would suddenly beat fast.</p>
<p>In the gaps between the leaves of the lush coconut groves in the distance, the bright and sparkling, unusually beautiful and magnificent spires protruded. This is the cremation ground. Under the tower, the corpses to be cremated are dressed up like going to a temple fair. Whether they are onlookers or the deceased's family members, they all wear slight smiles on their faces, without a trace of depression or tears, let alone mourning.</p>
<p>Here (Bali), the custom is to wrap the corpse sent to the cremation ground into the shape of a cow. Why wrap it into the shape of a cow? Why does a person have to turn into a cow after death? I don't know the reason. I have asked the oldest people with the longest history of living here, but they cannot say for sure. They only know that these corpses wrapped into cows have to be wrapped more like cows according to their status during their lifetime.</p>
<p>When the cremation is about to begin, many people raise the corpse and the gorgeous "chenyou de dazi" together, and walk around the cremation ground three times. It is said that this is to escape the fierce gods following behind. Then, the monks sprinkle holy water on the corpse, and then the family members and guests offer sacrifices. In this way, the sacrificial ceremony is completed. Then, the local band plays rapidly and passionately, and huge pieces of wood burst and crackle under the corpse, spitting out raging flames, burning, burning.</p>
<p>At this time, the onlookers and the deceased's family members hurriedly leave the cremation ground and disperse, fearing that the demons will spread various diseases and disasters on their bodies. As a result, the air in the cremation ground suddenly becomes quiet, and only the crackling sound of the burning wood breaks the silence of the dark night.</p>
<p>This strange and bizarre custom is different from the cremation ceremony in Siam.</p>
<h3>Night Notes from Changqi Port</h3>
<p>— Xin'er</p>
<p>The ship advances along the coast of the island nation, all green.</p>
<p>"We're almost at Nagasaki!" The travelers are already preparing to disembark.</p>
<p>Countless expectant gazes are directed at the undulating and delicate green mountains outside the cabin windows; however, the green mountains seem endless, and the coastline is already turning yellow! The travelers' once-excited feelings are gradually shrouded in gloomy emotions. The desire to see a new face of a foreign country is permeated with bewilderment.</p>
<p>The surroundings are covered in dim colors.</p>
<p>Not until the vast twilight, when it blends into the mountain colors, does the cabin suddenly become noisy! It turns out that the ship has entered the port: the famous Nagasaki Port. Only a glimpse can be seen. It seems that the ship is next to the mountain, and the dense, uniquely flavored oriental houses on the mountain are low and exquisite, vaguely discernible.</p>
<p>The sea journey, meeting with a hurricane attack, has been particularly embarrassing for several days, and everyone is eager to go ashore for a delicious meal. Therefore, they abandon the mood of appreciating the mountains and rivers, and after completing the procedures, they disembark one after another.</p>
<p>The ship is said to stop in Nagasaki for an hour and a half, and depart for Kobe at 7:30. Several hungry people rushed to a Chinese restaurant, which was already brightly lit, and a lot of time had passed. Fearing they would be late, they swallowed a little of the first plate of steak and hurriedly left. Foreigners are always punctual, and 7:30 will not wait until 8 o'clock to depart.</p>
<p>Back under the ship, I saw coal piles everywhere, and short laborers were loading coal into the ship. Everyone boarded the ship, discussing gains and losses, resting, chatting, and laughing;</p>
<p>"It's ten past eight!"</p>
<p>So, taking the opportunity, the travelers walked onto the deck. I haven't put on my shoes yet, and Fan Cao is calling outside:</p>
<p>"Come out and see! This night view…"</p>
<p>Leaning on the railing and looking out, I was a little surprised, as if I had changed to another realm. It's like being in a huge pair of sunglasses. Distant and near, hidden and visible, both mysterious and fresh. The surroundings are rows of small mountains connected together, high and low, surrounding a port that is not too big or too small, like a lake.</p>
<p>It feels like the whole mountain is lit up. In the shimmering light, the entire face of Changqi Port, somewhat shy like a virgin, is faintly revealed. Layer upon layer of wooden houses on the hillside, only the bright windows can be seen, exquisite and secluded, as if right in front of you, densely lined up. Cars travel on the streets, and car lights are like shooting stars flying through the air, decorating the small city in the mountains vividly.</p>
<p>The longer you look, the more wonderful it becomes. The sky is like transparent black crystal, like countless sparkling beads embedded in the black night dress of a beauty, on a crown. It is a vast place, yet it seems within reach. The mountain peaks gradually rise, the lights gradually become sparse, and at the top of the mountain, the sparse lights are like twice as bright starlight. Some are cleverly arranged in a row of seven, like the Big Dipper, shining with a faint red light. Although it may be man-made advertising, it doesn't seem vulgar at all when seen on this night.</p>
<p>Looking closely again for a long time, you can also see that in the area with fewer lights on the top of the mountain, there are several silver mists, golden sand-like lights, which are probably reflections of the lights behind the mountain. Like a few luminous jade trees. The light illuminates half of the green mountain's valley, beautifully and secludedly, giving a sense of divinity. The wooden houses at the foot of the mountain are so low that they seem to be on the water, and the lights in the windows feel even more in sync with the water. Small boats on the shore, gently rippling the waves, are like grains of bright pearls jumping. Up and down, left and right, there is a sense of clarity, and it is particularly quiet. The night market on the shore of Nagasaki cannot hear the slightest sound. Only a vast expanse of clear, fresh, and beautiful night air can be felt. The mountains, wooden houses, port water, and the entire port all reveal the delicate characteristics of the island nation. Changqi Port is better said to be Changqi Lake! It's just that at night, you can't see the entire face.</p>
<h3>Difficulty Eating</h3>

<h3>Birdsong</h3>
<p>— Hua Mu</p>
<p>Bird lovers don't necessarily have to be rich; the first thing they need is leisure. It is said that the most famous bird lovers are the bannermen of Beiping. These fallen aristocratic descendants have nothing to do all day long. They carry a tamed bird on their shoulders and leisurely stroll through the streets and teahouses, spending their days entirely on a bird. Treating birds as their lives, playing with birds to such an extent, it is indeed not an exaggeration to call them bird fanatics. Secondly, Suzhou people are also said to have a bird habit; there are many bird shops in the City God Temple market in Shanghai, and you can always see bird lovers holding bird cages in one hand and pacing leisurely in that temple market. Open spaces and teahouses are the places where their birds show off, judging them, discussing their merits and demerits, and spending their days playing with birds. Suzhou people are naturally idle and have a gentle style. Having this idle personality, they naturally see life as trivial, which is also a major reason.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, playing with birds is nothing more than because birds can jump and fight well, and they can also sing beautiful and moving songs to entertain people. Although some people specialize in liking fighting birds, most people like singing birds after all. Under the heavy curtains, a pot of clear tea, listening to the birds singing in the deep forests and green leaves in front of and behind the house, that kind of leisurely and quiet charm is indeed intoxicating. Some people say that listening to birdsong can cultivate one's mind, which is indeed reasonable, but the so-called cultivation here only refers to an idle and quiet mind.</p>
<p>Generally, people who live in cities are naturally not easy to enjoy this blessing. Not to mention cultivating their minds, even those who are naturally fond of birds can only buy birds and keep them in bamboo cages, hanging them in front of the hall to play with. This has naturally reduced most of the natural charm. Although the birds sing the same, the environment is different. In the countryside, there is birdsong in the morning, birdsong in the afternoon and evening, and even in the night there are night birds that sing with the watch; and hundreds of birds sing together; people can distinguish the difference between good, bad, joy, and sorrow in certain birdsongs. According to ancient legends, Gongye Chang could understand bird language. Although the matter is baseless, it cannot be said to be completely false. Because according to modern scientific methods to study the lives of birds and beasts, it is still possible to know their nature, so why can't it be said that Gongye Chang at least knew the nature of birds? Although this is said apart from purely playing with birds, it is still different from urban people who can only play with and listen to white-eyes, larks, and thrushes in bamboo cages in front of the hall.</p>
<p>In the countryside, people generally love magpies and hate crows. I don't know about other places, but in my hometown, superstition about birdsong is very deep. If a magpie flies and sings on the roof one day, everyone will secretly rejoice, thinking that the safe family letter from a distant relative has been delivered by the magpie first. If it is a crow, then they will be terrified, thinking that the ominous bird reporting the death has come. Because of this superstitious effect, even if a magpie snatches a chick, it can still roam freely and will not be harmed by guns and fire. Speaking calmly, the calls of magpies and crows are actually not much different, but love and hate are so different. This is the luck and misfortune of magpies and crows.</p>
<p>Owls live at night, so they are rarely seen. In my hometown, people simply regard owls as messengers of death. On a night with high winds and a dark moon, if an owl calls in front of or around the house, and someone in the house happens to be sick, the feeling of terror is very miserable, thinking that the patient has no hope of survival. But it is also very coincidental that it often comes true. And the owl's call is indeed extremely terrifying, it sounds as if a gloomy air is coming over you, chilling your hair. Although I have heard it once, it was on a cold winter night in October, with a dark moon and strong wind. I was chatting late into the night with a few cousins when suddenly a chirping sound came from the garden behind the house, gradually descending to the front of the house. The state of fear at that time is still terrifying to think about now.</p>
<p>Although I don't have the leisure to play with birds, I still enjoy appreciating birdsong in the mountains and countryside, which may be because I grew up in the countryside. Now, although I live outside the official residence, I still rarely hear birdsong. Between morning and evening, there are only a few sparrows on the paulownia and poplar trees; occasionally, a few turtle doves can be heard only before and after the rain clears. Mountain eagles, which sing loudly in the long sky of my hometown, and larks, which sing loudly in the morning, can no longer be heard.</p>

<p>Xia Hesheng's "Three Smiles"</p>
<p>Dunben (800) From 7:00 PM to 8:00 PM</p>
<p>Opening: The Pipa Record "Selling Hair"</p>
<p>Walking a long distance, braving wind and rain. Carrying a pipa on her back, disguised as a Taoist nun. Weeping in the dew and sighing at her thin fate. Hiding her shame and swallowing her anger to look for her husband. She has wanted to search for a long time but never dared to. What about her elderly parents-in-law? Her hometown has suffered years of drought and famine. The two old people are frail and sick. They have already returned to the underworld. It is hard to pity the filial daughter-in-law's lonely figure. Fortunately, Zhang Gong is very benevolent. He gave money for the funeral to help those in need. She bought her own hair to use as travel expenses. It is said that her husband is in the imperial capital. He became the new son-in-law of the Niu family. The truth and falsehood are still uncertain. Begging for food and rice from everyone she meets. Singing songs everywhere for officials and merchants to test. She is not used to traveling through mountains and rivers. Tears flow like a shuttle in the wind all day long. She only asks to meet him one day. She wouldn't mind being a concubine. Heaven has pity and secretly blesses her. Indeed, the main husband enjoys imperial favor. It is said that he lives in the Niu Prime Minister's mansion. Burning incense outside the door and reciting Amitabha. In an instant, her husband opens the river of love.</p>

<h3>Art</h3>

<p>Aviation Industry (1180) From 5:30 PM to 6:15 PM</p>
<p>The method of painting fans involves using a large sheep's hair brush to apply light ink. All shaded areas of mountains and rocks should be absorbed with a clean brush. Then, use a slightly darker ink to outline the shallower areas twice. Dyeing once or twice is sufficient. (2) Teaching outlines of Chinese and Western painting.</p>
<h3>Afternotes</h3>
<p>The Yihua Opera Troupe, led and organized by opera singer Lai Ling, has no less than thirty or forty members. Recently, they have been rehearsing a world-famous song and dance drama and need one hundred female members. Anyone with general knowledge, around sixteen or seventeen years old, with a handsome appearance, a height of four feet seven inches, a clean family background, and a special interest in singing and dancing, the troupe is now planning to widely recruit. Once accepted, there will be a monthly allowance of ten to fifty yuan. Those who wish to join should register at Room 2, 1597 Jing'an Temple Road, this city. (Bring a four-inch or six-inch full-body photograph)</p>
<p>Film music composer Mr. Ma Loufen recently received two records from Baidai Company, one, "Full Garden Fragrance," is a solo by Fan Hualin, and one, "New Ensemble," is a solo by erhu, which has now been completed and is very successful.</p>
<p>Miss Gu Hong of the Hankou Modern Society once attempted suicide by poisoning. The clothes, socks, and shoes she was wearing were all detained by Jin Peiyu. What is the meaning of this?</p>
<p>The leader (?) of the Ningbo Rose Troupe yesterday returned to Shanghai with Cheng Huihua, who falsely claimed to be Wang Naixue, to get engaged. It is also heard from the person in charge of the troupe in Ningbo that "the troupe has been dissolved in effect, and now the troupe leader and Miss Cheng are hiding in the Grand Shanghai Hotel."</p>
<p>Miss Zhang Xuezhou of the Modern Society has returned to Shanghai. Yesterday, she and Zhou Faxiao of the Mingmei Troupe went to Mr. Ma's house. What was the matter?</p>
<p>The other day, the Liu family held a wedding at the Huzhou Guild Hall on Beijing Road. There was a band playing the wedding march, which was the trio of Ma, Ma Letian of the Feiyin Society, Ma Xingtao of the Rose Troupe, and Ma Tinglong of the Bailu Society.</p>
<p>Miss Lai Ling, the "Wild Girl," is very skilled in singing and music. Recently, someone asked her to dance. I wonder how Miss Lai replied? (Above by telegraphic dispatch of Ma)</p>
<p>Dear Sir, I recently saw a piece of news you wrote in the Afternotes section of the eighteenth of the month, which vaguely stated that "Ruo Hui of the Dushi Society joined another society under the alias Shi Ying, but it fell through due to a dispute over fees," etc. The content, in general, is libelous to Hui's reputation and personality. Hui's entry into another society did not involve any procedures, and was entirely due to her own interest. However, you did not consider this in advance, fabricated facts, confused the public, and thought it was beneficial to damage Hui's reputation and personality, or perhaps there was another purpose. This is not worth a knowledgeable person's laugh and does not require explanation. However, since you can write the manuscript and submit it for publication, you must have evidence in hand. Now, in order to make the truth clear to all, please publish the facts of Hui's joining another society (which society?) and the dispute over fees in the newspaper within three days, otherwise, please do not chatter here in the future, fabricate rumors, stir up trouble, and only be despised by others. Sincerely, Yin Yu and Ruo Hui</p>
<p>Yin Yu unfortunately suffered serious injuries and died. Who will be the person to continue the cleaning work?</p>
<p>Yin Yu told me that "Ruo Hui" of the Dushi Society sang for a few days in the Rose Troupe under the alias "Ruo Ying." It was indeed due to the issue of fees that it fell through. However, the Dushi Society is now denying it. This matter of no evidence of death has become a mystery. I hope "Ruo Hui" herself will make a fair and conscientious statement, or that the Rose Troupe will provide factual proof.</p>
<p>Editor's Note: Yin Yu's death in this way is truly like a dragon appearing but not showing its tail. The editor went to a hospital on Haig Road yesterday, but Yin Yu is not her real name, so I returned without success. Today, I received a manuscript from Da Gong, saying that Yin Yu has died from serious injuries, but I hope there will be a correction to this news. As for the matter of Miss Ruo Hui, today there is a letter from her to Yin Yu. I hope the Rose Troupe will officially resolve this "undeliverable" lawsuit. Otherwise, it is better to say nothing!</p>
<p>The entertainment party of the Radio Association had an income of five thousand yuan and expenses of seven hundred yuan, according to reports.</p>
<p>Yan Hua did not strictly act and left the Shanghai Theater Company. Xu Jian will also follow him soon. It is unknown how Zhou Xuan will resolve this. We might as well open our eyes and watch.</p>
<p>Today's personnel changes in the Rose Singing Troupe and the Shanghai Opera Company (one troupe is cleaning up, one company is falling apart) are very noteworthy events.</p>
<p>Secret news has arrived that Jin Peiyu, the former president of Xinhua News Agency, has secretly come to Shanghai and is scheduled to return to Hankou within five days. (It is said that he came to "sell" saxophones.) I remember that a year ago, Jin Peiyu appeared in the song and dance world with his "own car," looking down on everyone and playing with ××. Yesterday, I saw Jin Peiyu wearing a blue cloth gown, broken leather shoes, and white pants for the hot weather, looking very disheveled. Everyone who saw him was shocked! (Above by Da Gong)</p>
<p>Film</p>
<h3>Recent News of "Song of Everlasting Regret"</h3>
<p>Xinhua Film Company's "Song of Everlasting Regret" has been fully prepared by Shi Dongshan. The location for the exterior scenes has been selected in a certain place in Hangzhou and will be filmed there soon. The interior scenes will be planned entirely by Hu Zhuoyun. The results in the future will surely be above "The Peach Blossom Fan."</p>
<p>The plot writes about the love between Zhu Dongxin and Ma Nina, which is extremely delicate and profound. It also includes social issues and life issues, with clear and quick warnings, which are especially meaningful. It is heard that Zhu Dongxin will be played by Mei Qian, and Ma Nina will be played by Wang Renmei, both of whom are very suitable for the roles.</p>
<h3>Guanglu Premieres "Love's Bloody Tears"</h3>
<p>"Love's Bloody Tears" is Moggie's immortal masterpiece, telling the love story of Mimi and Rodolfo, which has a wide readership in the literary world and has earned many of my tears. In the past, during the silent film era, it starred John Gilbert and Lillian Gish, and I don't know how many movie fans were captivated, immersing people in an atmosphere of sadness, unable to express the bittersweet. Now, this play has been re-filmed in a sound version, starring Little Van Punk and Mead Lawrence. The depiction still focuses on the romantic history of the two, especially using music to strengthen the progress of the plot. Regarding the process and tone of the sad drama, there is obviously a deeper revelation. This achievement must be praised for the efforts of director Paul Stein, who has already demonstrated his extraordinary talent in the musical "When the Lilacs Bloom," and has even more amazing achievements in this film. The film opens today at the Guanglu Grand Theater.</p>
<h3>Silver Jottings</h3>
<p>— Zhi Er</p>
<p>After several twists and turns, Gogol's satirical masterpiece "The Government Inspector" will meet us today. It is expected that the Jin Cheng, which has been deserted for a long time, will have a lively atmosphere.</p>
<p>Competing against amateur actors is "Little Aunt." Although "Little Aunt" has Xia Peizhen's "Coronation Ceremony" as a selling point, it may be difficult to compete with so many amateur actors.</p>
<p>"The Government Inspector" has been rehearsing at Jin Cheng every night in the past few days. Recently, due to the upcoming Shanghai premiere, rehearsals are being held at the Yueming Company during the day to ensure proficiency.</p>
<p>I still think that Yuan Meiyun has chosen the wrong path to make movies. She would be better off singing Peking opera, returning to her life as a "young actress." For example, "hanging up the signboard." Playing in movies is not as glamorous as Peking opera. At least when Yuan Meiyun's name appears in the newspaper, it won't be as big as Mei Lanfang's name in relation to the play. As for surrounding the name with bright electric lights or using neon to decorate the name, that's even more of a spectacle that only Peking opera has.</p>
<p>Yuan Meiyun, who wants to "hang up the signboard," why not change careers from now on?</p>
<p>It is said that Wang Bin has gone to Hong Kong to write screenplays at the invitation of Boss Shao, which makes people feel stunned for a long time.</p>
<p>If the market were not so depressed, I don't think Wang Bin would be reduced to being a "worthless wood."</p>
<h3>"The Government Inspector"'s Government Inspector (played by Jin Shan)</h3>
<h3>Publishing Industry</h3>
<p>"Mingxing Bi-Monthly," Volume 3, Issue 2, published by Mingxing Film Company and distributed by Huahai Trading Company, was published today (November 1st). This issue is a special issue for "The Jade Horse." Opposite is a two-color silver print of one of the stars of "The Jade Horse," Yan Yuexian, Li Jianong, Wang Zhengxin, Sun Min, etc. The photos include individual photos of Ms. Yan Yuexian and Gu Lanjun, the dynamics of Mingxing Bi-Monthly, stills from "The Jade Horse," and photos of the "The Jade Horse" photography project, director, and stars, all using photogravure printing, which is very valuable. In terms of text, there is Xu Xinfu's "About the Production of The Jade Horse," Zheng Heng's "Gleanings from The Jade Horse," Guo Tingyun's "Switching to a Fresh Taste," Rong Wen's "Quick Sketches of the Actors in The Jade Horse," etc. Zheng Renze's "A Group Active in The Jade Horse" is a cartoon. The other sections "Bi-Monthly" and "Mingxing Diary" are still published as usual. On the bottom is a high-definition print of Wang Zhengxin in costume as a great detective in "The Jade Horse." The printing is excellent and the layout is novel, which readers have long been familiar with. The selling price of this issue is still five cents, and all bookstores and newsstands are selling it.</p>
