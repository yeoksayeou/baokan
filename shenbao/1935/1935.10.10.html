<h3 id="c1">日內瓦幕後之活動　國聯制裁步驟　　英法緩急不同　波奧匈瑞態度未定　美德日等亦成問題　十六條解釋起爭議 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>（日內瓦）國聯大會原定今日午後五時開會考慮行政院申責意國之决議案、茲已改爲六時開會、（上海時間爲十日上午二時）、聞因英法對於制裁問題意見歧異之故、主席團會議原定四時舉行、則擬提早一小時、聞法代表之意見、制裁應在經濟制裁限度內逐步進行、英代表則主張制裁應由純粹的經濟制裁而進至嚴峻計畫、至於經濟制裁、應整個立即實施、不得分成階段、英自治領代表今晨舉行會議、英不管部閣員艾登曾蒞會解釋英政府所抱之態度、外傳英國態度漸弱之說全無根據、英國之活動始終以不作無效的與延宕的行動爲主旨、未嘗離此立塲、昨今兩日此間慕後甚爲活動、以期儘速佈置國聯應辦之事、今日大會開會時、取銷對阿軍火出口禁令似將在首先討論之諸問題中、（九日路透電）</p>
<p>（日內瓦）國聯大會討論至少當歷兩日始畢、在此時期內、將由各會員國交換意見、俾成立特種委員會、以調整國聯大會所决定之制裁措置、此外對於非國聯會員國、如美日德三國亦將與之諮詢、按各會員國均有决定採取經濟財政制裁之自由但過有各國應協同行動之處、則應由國聯會作一切準備、以期互相調整因此大會將有調整委員會之設、該委員會將繼續開會、至意阿戰爭終止始巳、至於實施制裁、則將先從經濟方面入手、其中第一步係限制各項戰爭必需品之蝓出、戰爭必需品又分爲兩項、最初限制槍械彈藥之輸出、其次限制軍火工業所用各項主要製品之輸出、第一步完成以後、當進一步限制意國貨物輸入、嗣後調整委員會幷可禁止各項次要物品、如茶糖咖啡等之輸出、俾對於侵略國之平民施以壓迫云、（八日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（日內瓦）實施制裁一事現已發生爭議、若干法學家以爲國聯盟約第十六條規定制裁之自動實施、已由一九二一年國聯大會之决議案打銷、故今須有大會一致贊同票、始能令諸會員國共負實施制裁之義務、如果必須大會一致向意爲先决條伴、則制裁之實施將益見困難、</p>
<p>波蘭外長貝克大佐昨乘飛機抵此、衆極注意此行、聞貝克或將提出關於波蘭態度之某種保留、且聞貝克之來此乃應駐波蘭意使之殷切請求云、</p>
<p>奧匈與瑞士三國之態度亦均未定、蓋三國均依賴意國之貿易、參加任何方式之制裁、諸多困難也、大會如决定實施制裁、則協助辦理此舉之委員會、將以行政院若干理事毘連意大利諸國之代表及與意國有商業關係之二三國代表組之、（九日路透電）、</p>
<p>（日內瓦）國聯代表今日預測、對意制裁將於下星期內實行、現將推定隣近意國之希臘·南斯拉夫·奧大利·瑞士·法蘭西·及西班牙之六國、組織委員會、建議實施制裁辦法、美聯社記者分訪各國代表、據稱、會員國願否實施制裁將由各國自擇而視彼等願否觸怒墨索里尼以爲斷制裁之實施將爲國聯權力最後之試騐、實施制裁之國家將設　斷絕破壞盟約國與會員國及非會員國間之財政商業與個人關係、如欲澈底進行制裁、勢將影響美日德等非會員國、此間多數代表贊成首先不購意貨、藉此剝奪意國之外匯、使其無力購買原料、並認羅斯福總統頒佈之中立法、業已成爲有力之對意制裁矣、（八日國民電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）此間一般印象、以爲美國未必與國聯合作、以施行制裁辦法、或應請派旁聽員出席於辦理制裁事之國聯委員會、惟美國並不反對制裁、當可承認任何有效力的國　封鎖行動、亦不致堅持美人對意通商之權利、（九日路透電）</p>
<p>（東京）消息靈通各界預料日本已於一九二三年三月二十七日退出國府、故將拒絕任何方式之對意制裁、據請日本決計仍遠離國聯、旁立注視發展、惟日政府將遵守一九三三年三月二十七日日皇諭旨中之言、贊助國際和平之增進、再日本旣屢次聲明其處於爲東亞一安靖要素之特別地位、殊不欲進行似足增重世界他處爭鬥之政策、以貽自相矛盾之護、故日本雖願維持與意國之經濟興商業關係、但爲尊重諭旨人道道德起見、不得不反對以戰品供給意國、日本之施行與國聯政策幷趨之行動似不致引起國內之反對、蓋意國用兵東菲、無暇從事實業、日　本輸出物品、尤其爲天然絲與人造絲二項必將爲之旺盛也、（九日路透電）</p>
<h3 id="c2">國聯大會主席團　接受行政院議案　準備卽付大會表决　實行盟約第十六條 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>（日內瓦）國聯主幹部今日午後三時開會、决定今日國聯大會會議所應採之手續、主幹部准許對於行政院主席所宣佈國聯行政院指斥意國之報吿書、加以一般之討論、大會主席皮尼士後將宣讀一文、意代表阿洛錫將繼起發言、反對國聯手續、然後行政院主席將宣讀六國委員會之報吿書、並通吿各會員、如不發言表示意見、則將認爲贊成此報吿書、而允援助其他會員國實行盟約第十六條之條文、如會員反對此報吿書或不願投票則必須陳說其理由、（九日路透電）</p>
<p>（日內瓦）據今日午後消息、國聯大會會議將設法於今夜或明晨結束、蓋許多發言人將不復發言、而由主席皮尼斯卽捷克外長宣讀一文、以代替之也、意代表阿洛錫將發言抗議國聯手續、指爲妄用手續規程、（九日路透電）</p>

<p>（羅馬）外部發言人今日聲稱、卽使國聯對意實施經濟及財政制裁、意國大槪仍不退出國聯、惟意國之最後决定、當視施行制裁之方法爲根據云、一般人對於此項聲明之解釋、咸以爲如有海軍封鎖之事、意國卽將退盟、若制裁方法較爲緩和、則尙可容忍、該發言人尙稱、意國隨時準備考慮新建議、些言亦大可注意云、（八日國民電）</p>
<p>（羅馬）今日意大利日報載向被視爲政府喉舌之蓋達氏所著一文、謂意國雖準備於國聯决定實施制裁時退出國聯、但墨索里尼仍願根據一九零六年條約與英法兩國直接談判阿比西尼亞問題、偏見之豫料、以爲意國於佔據阿杜華後、其行動卽將趨重外交範圍、此實不明意國行動主要之原因、非爲榮舉與國威問題、實由於阿國一再無端侵略之故、阿杜華與其他險要點之爲意軍佔據、純爲局部關係之事、意軍在各方面陣綫之行動、將視阿比西尼亞威脅所成之目的輿需要繼續進行云、（八日路透電）</p>
<p>（羅馬）外部發言人今日對於國聯制裁謂無大實效、繼復聲稱、意國擬向友邦購買其所需要之物品、並擬在國內集欵支付、故經濟制裁、對於意國毫無影響云、（八日國民電）</p>
<h3 id="c4">英內閣　草擬制裁建議 <a href="#c4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>（倫敦）政府專家今日已著手草擬對意施行經濟制裁建議、該項建議將提交國聯核議、（八日軍民電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）內閣將於明日開會、討論英國代表團在日內瓦所提出關於實施制裁之建議、聞英國建議分爲四項、（一）禁止意國貨物輸入、此項措置有特殊效力、則以意國對國聯會員國之輸出、佔其輸出總額百分之七十故也、（二）禁止貸欵意國（三）禁止某種原料品對意國輸出、（四）取銷對阿國運輸軍火之禁令、至於對意斷絕外交關係之一層、則尙未經考慮、一般意見多不加贊成、蓋以爲如一旦絕交、則此後與意國進行談判、以中止戰爭、將不復有可能云、（八日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）英內閣今日開會、歷二小時、考慮因意阿開戰而起之時局、議定臨時辦法數種、隨國聯日內所採行之計盡爲轉移、衆料國會工黨新領袖阿特里今日將往謁首相鮑爾溫、政府於國聯宣佈其制裁辦法之决議後、卽將通知阿特里、蓋國聯有此宣佈後、英國將召集國會、商榷要事也、衆信國會重開之期、大約爲十月二十一日、（九日路透電）</p>

<p>阿京　阿國皇帝昨向本社記者發表談話云、「意國侵略行爲旣由國聯會行政院加以判定、吾國業已得直、在精神上吾國已獲分所應得之報酬、吾國在過去旣無意戰爭、在現在亦然、惟阿國國土現已遭意國侵略、吾人職責所在、自當加以保衛、吾人並未啟釁、然對於由他人挑釁之武力侵略、亦决不甘屈伏、且當九月問巴黎英法意三國會議向吾國徵詢意見時、吾人曾應允對於一切讓步、凡不妨礙吾國尊嚴者、均可予以接受、吾國忍辱負重、其用意原在避免意國之侵略、詎知侵略之舉、仍屬無可挽回、嗣後吾國對於國聯會行政院五國小組委員會所提出之建議案亦已接受、吾國願與具有善良意志之各國合作、於此又獲一證明」云、（九日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>阿京　北鄙阿杜華阿克森兩城之失陷、此間人士認爲僅係前鋒小接觸、而與戰局勝負無甚關係、當局現仍謂戰爭甫經開端、對於阿軍勝利前途、有極大把握、傳聞阿軍著名之敢死隊以三百人爲一隊、已攻入意屬伊利特里、距意屬殖民地政府所在地已不過六十六公里、且聞阿國名將加薩已率眾八萬八千人、沿伊利特里邊境進發、抵抗意軍右翼、兩方正式部隊之接觸、將發端於是、蒂格里省長賽雄將軍則電阿皇、謂已俘獲意軍上校一名及其他軍官三十名、阿皇定於本月十二日類赴前方出征、又阿國皇儲亦已率兩縱隊馳赴阿杜華前綫、（八日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3 id="c15">今年之雙十節 <a href="#c15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>— 都</p>
<p>雙十節為我中華民國誕生之辰。亦即中華民族發展自由意志擺脫專制羈絆告厥成功之日也。彼時革命諸先賢。伏處憔悴虐政之下。分頭秘密活動。謀為人民解倒懸之厄。其艱險曲折之情形。當有什百倍於吾人所能想像者。頭顱拼卻。熱血　　。經幾多回之壯烈犧牲。以掙得此一葉光明成功史。吾人坐對莊嚴燦爛之紀念節。亦寗有不興高山仰止之思者。第於緬懷之餘。輒覺汗顏不禁。以先烈締造之難。付託之重。而吾後人所堪將承負荷者則如何。民國奠基。以迄今日。亦既二十有四年矣。四郊多壘。變故迭乘民智未進。物力彌難。社會猶循襄日之成軌。百凡都乏鮮明之進展。其得資為依據以勉思報慰地下者。果何在乎。吾人所以每逢此日而常不勝其低回悒悒也。</p>
<p>今年之雙十節。瞻顧環境。雖猶如舊。而有一點差可予吾人以興奮者。則全國運動會適於今日行開　禮是也。運動之意義。自其局部言之。原只在鍜鍊個人之體魄。養成尚武之精神而已。若就整個而論。則轉移萎靡之風氣。推進國家之地位。胥有資於是矣。溯我國積弱之由來。固自有其種種原素。而缺乏運動觀念。要為其中主因之一。蓋國人夙昔囿於崇尚禮法之成見。罔知修練體魄。轉以剛猛為戒。士子用文弱自矜。美人以病態見稱。徵諸史乘。章章可覩。由此體力衰孱之結果。影響駸及乎政治。而因循頹唐之局勢於以造成。外既不以足抗強圉之侵陵。內亦無術以謀事態之更新。朝野上下。在暮氣籠罩中。寗復有振作可言。清廷崩潰之速。亦正坐當時　頇過甚。乃予吾先賢以可蹈之隙耳。今次運動大會在滬舉行。全市轟動。萬口喧騰。事前籌備之倥偬。各方參加之踴躍。舉國期望之殷切。會場空氣之緊張。在在有以徵見國人對於運動興趣之亢進。而非復如伊昔之漠視與閉距。集全國壯健之青年。作矯捷顛撲之比賽。其所給予吾人之觀感。已極美滿而愉快。至於運動健兒以外。有如許擁擠之觀眾。具若爾熱烈之情緒。此中現象。尤令人油然生民族勃興之望。惟願全國人士。自茲而後。力圖上進。適應環境。從事於合理之運動。以增進體魄之健全。一洗已往委靡之痼習。除圖挽救國勢於陵夷。以慰革命先烈在地之靈。以發　此璀璨　之雙十節。</p>

<p>— 汪精衛</p>
<p>中國今日，如欲救亡圖存，必須撇去囂浮與消沉兩種習氣，這是我們同志所常常說着的。我們不會忘記，在中國歷史上當危急存亡的時候，有不少的忠臣烈士，盡心竭力的去挽回，繼使一時不能挽回，而盡心竭力的結果，也留下將來恢復的種子。同時我們也不要忘記在中國歷史上遇着外患的時候，有許多人士，都始而浮囂，終而消沉，其浮囂的現象，是不度德，不量力，好大言，無實際，而其消沉的現象，是自信力消失，惟知以偸生苟活爲事，因爲這樣，神州陸沉，中原邱墟，在中國歷史上往往遇着。如何才能撇去囂浮與消沉兩種習氣呢？惟有沉着。沉着與消沉之不同，不但須存之於决心，而且須見之於行事。所謂見之於行事，其一，在時時自省，惟自省而後能自責，惟自資而後能自救，其二，在時時與他人比較，惟比較而後知優劣，惟知優劣而後能勇猛精進。救亡圖存的目的不是一天所能達到的，我們必須下了决心，用不斷的努力，一天一天的積累起來，譬如每年之中，將積累的結果，計算一遍，或每日之中，將積累的結果，計算一遍，如果有了積累，便是沉着，反之，便是消沉，這是存亡之界。救亡圖存的責任，旣然要積累起來，那末，時間上，能容我們積累嗎？空間上，能容我們積累嗎，只怕我們窮年累日的積累，不足供人家片刻的摧殘，這誠然是最可驚心的，然而力量不是一朝一夕所能做成，我們除了積累，還有什麽辦法？可憐我們國人有一種心理，封神傳，姜子牙沒有辦法，便是太上老君，西遊記，孫行者沒有辦法，便是觀音菩薩；這種心理，無形中支配了一切，所以將「積累」二字看做等閒，然而這種妄想，終久要消滅的。我們爲國家的生存計，只有積累，爲個人良心的安慰計，也只有積累。孟子說：夭壽不貳，修身以俟之，所以立命也。「俟」字是危險的，正所謂時不我與，時不我待，然而修身却是自己把握得住的，這便是我們今日安心立命的所在。二十四年國慶日）</p>
<h3 id="c17">國民經濟建設運動之意義及其實施 <a href="#c17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>— 蔣中正</p>
<p>（一）導言</p>
<p>中國今日根本之危機，全在經濟之殘破，以致國民生活日益困窮，而民族之命運，亦因之岌岌危殆，不能生存于二十世紀之今日，故目前我國唯一念要之問題，乃爲如何挽救此已就崩潰之國民經濟，而使人民獲得相當之生活，惟如何解决貨棄於地，而民困於野之矛盾可恥的現象，而謀國民經濟之發展，因此認爲今日須有一種運動，繼新生活運動之後而起，卽國民經濟建設運動是也</p>
<p>（二）國民經濟建設運動與新生活運</p>
<p>動之關係</p>
<p>國民經濟建設運動，與新生活運動，二者實相為表裏，故必須相輔而行，蓋新生活運動，爲民族的，爲修身的，着重於道德與精神方面爲主，實爲國民經濟建設運動之體，而國民經濟建設運動，爲民生的，爲生產的，着重於行動與物質方面爲主，實亦爲新生活運動之用，新生活運動，所以奠立民族之精神的基礎，而國民經濟建設運動，則所以充實民族之物質的某礎，故二者實缺一不可者也，</p>
<p>（三）國民經濟建設必須提倡一種普</p>
<p>遍的運動之原因</p>
<p>論者或以爲振興國民之經濟，救濟人民之生活，皆國家政策中應有之義，祗須政府努力行之可矣，何必別爲一種運動，不知中國國民經濟，枯竭疲敝之所由，爲人與物之脫節，爲人與事之脫節，爲生產要素與生產事業間之脫節，亦爲生產各部門問之不相整調，不相聯繫，而爲整個之脫節，社會不知生產之重要，產業不能得良好之環境，以遂其發展，是以欲謀中國國民經濟之更生，非先喚起廣大之自覺不可，非使人才或人力與天然資源發生極密切之關涉不可，非使各種人力與生產要素，爲全體適當之配置，與全民共同之結合，而使爲有效之發揮不可，非改變一切舊觀念，而消除有形無形之障礙不可，尤非調劑、供求，使生產狀况，與消費狀况相應不可，在此運動中，政府固有種種應爲之事業，然尤非使人民積極參加，成爲推進此運動之主力不可也，其在另一方面，則此運動又非如其他之社會運動，僅由人民團體鼓吹唱導，或其團體之分子，遵守約束，各自努力而卽可以收效，以其往往關涉於國家之法令與政策，且其間有許多事項，又必賴國家機關之政治力量以推行，故又必集合政府人民各種公私集團一切之力量，而後始能推行盡利也，</p>
<p>（四）國民經濟建設運動之涵義</p>
<p>明乎前段所論之意義，則本運動之涵義，不難自明，蓋國民經濟建設運動者，爲促起人民以自動改善國民之經濟，卽爲集合全國社會與生產機關各部分之努力，以建設健全之國民經濟，政府則以所有之力量，爲之排除障碍，且與以種種之助力與便利者也，國民經濟建設運動者，以建設國民經濟，卽解决民生問題爲目的，與國家經濟政策，範圍有廣狹之殊，蓋國家經濟政策，於民生而外，更須注重於國計，而國民經濟建設運動之本位，則爲國民也，其對象則惟民生也，總理以民生主義爲三民主義之中心，國民經濟建設運動者，實行三民主義之基點亦卽民生主義實現之初步也。</p>
<p>（五）國民經濟建設運動應有之目標</p>
<p>本運動之總目標，爲「盡人力，　地利，均供求，暢流通，以謀國民經濟之健全發展」更分述之如左，在積極方面，（甲）增加生產總量，解决生活需要，（乙）增加工作機會，解决失業問題，（丙）增加輸出產品，藉謀貿易平衡（丁）保障投資安全，鼓勵生產活動，在消極方面，（甲）解除阻礙生產發展之外面的原因，（如捐稅，產業法規，勞資關係等）（乙）解除阻碍經濟發展之內在的原因，（如缺乏經營方法興人才等等）（丙）解除阻滯貨物流通之障礙，（如交通金融運銷制度等）（丁）解除妨礙生產建設之心理的因素，（如愚昧，迷信，保守，缺乏勞動習慣，及漠視經濟等等）（說明）本運動之首要急務，爲使人盡其才，一方面使專門人才，有貢獻能力於經濟建設之機會，一方面使有勞動力之國民，盡量發揮共勞動力於經濟建設，同時並須養成中級人員，有實務之經騐，與指導之能力，蓋必先人盡其才而後地盡其利，此爲我國從事國民經濟建設時，所不可忽略者也，</p>

<p>男女頗多</p>
<p>庭爲之滿、被告駱虞生、仍延徐傑等三律師代爲辯護、旣據捕房律師張天蔭起稱、在改期中、捕房曾將在被吿處抄出之白西裝褲一條、送往愛文義路一千三百二十號門牌雷士德醫學研究院、請專家復騐、其結果該褲上之紅點、並非血漬、實爲普通之油漆、被吿之律師、於上次庭訊時、呈出</p>

<p>該信係被吿之父駱肇新被人暗殺後投於被告之匿名信、內中指明其父被殺、與住居法界金神父路新新里南一弄一家之張榮生有關、但駱肇新被害後、該管老閘捕房曾往張家調査、張已逃逸、迄未拘獲、又被告自被拘後、曾導領探員至出事地點指明死者被害處所及狀况、捕房當時雖在</p>
<p>死者房中</p>

<p>旁聽女子</p>
<p>周意影（係死者金戴氏女兒金令儀之同學）、向庭上聲稱、上月二十三號上午八時許、我往法界天主堂街敎會學校讀書、道經四川路北京路附近、曾目覩被告乘騎脚踏車由南向北過僑而去、其時被告身穿長衣、惟顏色不能記憶、因我平時往金令儀家遊玩時、輒與被告相遇、故而認識云云惟被吿對於此點、</p>

<p>莫拋一綫生機去，愛國心腸豈肯寒。</p>
<p>此記者今日感懷詩也。讀者或者要問問什麽意思，聽我道來：民國二十四年來，我們過的國慶日，可以説年年在天災人禍之中，過的是凄風苦雨的生活，强顔歡笑，心底裏真有説不岀的苦痛。所以有人呌我做國慶紀念文章，我終是託故辭去，既不願跟人來趕熱閙，更不願故作違心之論，還是免開金口的倒落個乾净。可是看看這幾年來的民氣，和愛國情緒，在國貨方面講：都有一些安慰。便是國貨的岀品，一年多似一年，許多國貨製造家，虧他們絞腦瀝血的造岀許多國貨來，和舶來貨品一樣精美，看上去竟分辨不岀，所以明明是國貨，有人還疑為不是國貨，這是中國最近的一綫生機。再看看一般的國民，除掉醉心洋貨不知愛國為何物的退帳東西以外，一大半的國民，都是愛用國貨，買起物品來，還要東打聽西調查的研究是不是國貨，有時國貨價值貴一些，質地次一些，甯使來買國貨，人同此心，心同此理，這是數年來國民心理的進步，也是民族復興的一綫生機。記者很希望大家來發揚光大的保持下去。無論怎樣威逼，怎樣利誘，甚至不許你説抵制外貨，不容你來提倡國貨，可是我們愛國愛用國貨的心，無論如何，終是不肯退縮，不肯忘掉的。正是</p>
<p>天長地久有時盡，愛國心腸無盡期。</p>
<h3 id="c160">國慶與國貨 <a href="#c160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>— 玄萬</p>
<p>時間並不因爲我們經濟的國雞，而慢慢地滑過去，一年一度的我們這國慶日，不正是於今天又已光臨在大家目前嗎？在這國產凋疲，農村破產，整個工商界籠罩在不景氣下的今日，我們遇到這一個國慶日的來臨，的確是有些啼笑不得的光景，可是要曉得這次不是空言坐論的時候了，分割市塲鬥爭的喪鐘，早已震破了我們的耳鼓，世界經濟恐慌的怒潮，早已激盪了我們的心弦，在眼前，唯一的希望，只有堅築壁壘，培養實力，去謀應付這種外來的侵襲，所以，提倡國貨，消滅入超，這自是我們最重要最切實的工作，同時，在今天，也眞是我們迴顧過去，檢討現在，瞻仰未來的一天。</p>
<p>今年是大家曉得的，學生國貨年，是國貨運動益趨實踐路綫的第三個年頭，雖然荊棘叢生的國貨進行，是因了前途的障碍重重，還依然輾轉在很艱危的道上，但是，幸有許多企業界和熱心者的吶喊，宣揚，嘶啞的喉嚨，埋頭苦幹地努力追求未來的光明，所以，三年來的成績，無論對於產銷合作，改進出品，開拓國貨市塲上，到底給與國貨發展前途，以喏大的助力，這是一個永遠不可磨滅的偉大的功績。</p>
<p>我更具着熱烈的希望，國慶日要大家來幹些有意義的國貨工作，我們曉得，在現下，發展國產前途唯一的兩條進行綫，第一是謀國貨推銷內地，深入民問的新展開，以我國這樣廣大的領域，而邊區各省，如四川，陝，甘，雲，貴等，他們正當要我們國貨的輸入，去努力經營，第二是嬰擴展海外市塲計劃的實現，多做些國際貿易，，來挽回一部份的入超，我們要希望完成這兩個工作，在本年最後的三個月，使「學生國貨年」的聲勢，更以白熱的尖銳的强度，而樹立其突飛猛進的姿態。</p>
<p>這是一個十分黯澹的國慶日，我們實是無慶可祝，我們只有趕快掙脫經濟桎梏，去打開一條新生路，「减少入超」，和「維護國產」，這是我們目前最重要的基本工作啊！</p>
<h3 id="c161">雙十節與國貨運動 <a href="#c161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>— 巴玲</p>
<p>時間之神，行使它的職樺，使光陰依照着一定的次序過去，很快的現在已是民國二十四年的雙十節了。我們欣逢創造民國的雙十節，心中自感到異常的高興，然而檢閱國家的一切，　生的狀况，却不由的使我們把異常高興的情緒，降去了不少的程度，這是一伴多麼使人掃　而遺憾的事呀！</p>
<p>中國在這二十多年來，實在太不幸了！以前的年年內戰，誠然是民國史上一頁極大的汚點，一自永不能洗滌的汚點。</p>
<p>所以，我們總括一句說：民國二十餘年來的內災外患，差不多把整個的國家，深深的陷於沉淪的地步了，譬諸個人，本來身體非常强健的，經了許多的外症內症，時而傷寒，時而瘡　，一年三百六十五天之中，差不多天天與藥餌爲伴，這樣的人，怎會健全？個人固然經不起各種症患的　凌，國家又怎樣經得起年年的內災外惠的到來呢？這是一定的道理，誰也不能加以否認的。</p>
<p>但是，話雖這樣說，隨便那一個人，患了病症，自然有它致病之源，找到了病的癥結，而後再對症發藥，漸漸的走上康健之路，一個國家的貧弱，當然也有它所以貧弱的理由。知道了它的原因之後，而後再想出種種補救的方針，自然也慢慢的走上富强之路，我們中國的病源是什麼呢？照我看來，我們中國的病源，固然很多，但是，全國人民的不能切切實實的服用國貨，實在也是病源中之最要病源，孫中山先生說：「我們中國人服用外貨，每年要流出現金五萬萬元。平均每人要佔一元以上。」自從海禁開通以來，外貨的進口，源源不絕，有增無减，其數量何止五萬萬元，卻以每年五萬萬元而論，二十餘年來的總計，該是如何的使人驚駭感歎呢，年年現金流出。白銀出口，任何富强的國家，歸根結底，也要走到貧弱之途，因此，照這樣看來，我們要救國，第一應該切實的服用國貨。潘仰堯先生說：「救國之道，固然要從各方面入手，可是，提倡國貨，也不能忽視。」這幾句話，是很有至理的，我很希望全國同胞，而今而後，大家抱定服用國貨的主張，立定服用國貨的觀念，人人如此，那末三年之後，國家自然會富强了。今天是民國二十四年的雙十節，我們希望從今天起，全國同胞都起來提倡國貨，服用國貨，使今天的雙十節，不僅含有慶祝雙十的意義，而且也是全國同胞服用國貨總動員開始的一天。</p>
<h3 id="c162">從國慶紀念想到重用國貨的意義 <a href="#c162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>— 淸癯</p>
<p>今天是國慶紀念的日子，凡是中華民國的人民，沒餓一個不知道這一天大家應當把那二十四年前，武昌起義的諸先烈存在心頭，紀念一番，你！儻然是忘掉了這個轟轟烈烈的一頁有光榮的血史，膽敢說一句，就是忘了本；唉！那末·我想到這一層，不由得轉到「國貨」兩字，爲什麼要時時還在提倡呢？其實紀念開國的重要，原不在禮節，休假，開會，演說，和在歡，跳躍，娛樂，高唱等等，做着形式；唯一的主旨，旣是叫「紀念」，不是「紀念」這一天，而應當「紀念」到創造的艱難，什麼可以鞏固國基，開發國產，方算得「紀念」，纔有一些意思。</p>
<p>所以今天，吾就把重用「國貨」，來寫作一篇獻詞，因爲現在「國貨」儘你處處嚷著，總覺得還有許多人不狠了解，以爲「國貨」不及「洋貨」的漂亮，推他們所抱的心理，不外有下列三原因；第一種，以爲世界文明日進，人類的慾望和嗜好，也日趨於奢侈的一途，奢侈的起源，就是民智愈開，一切的制作，就從簡陋而變爲新奇，從粗笨而變爲靈巧，人類是富有審美性的，心理的趨向，自然歡喜新奇而愛好靈巧。第二種，以爲國際通商，沒有不在競爭方面著力，製造的出路，泰半投人所好，以圖利益的擴展，故凡平常日用所需用的物品，甲國所有的，而乙國沒有，勢不能不買甲國的貨物，以滿我的慾望，縱費重金，也所情願了。第三種，是上等社會，最重體面，凡衣食住，必要和自已的身分地位相稱，故家產愈富，職位最高的人們，那起居飲食，必定過分的講究，在他們以爲不是這樣，不足以擺我闊綽，裝我門面，甚且以爲被人家看不起，招旁的譏笑，就是無此力量，也祗得勉强從事，以隨俗尙。有了這三個原因，所以日日提倡「國貨」，而外貨輸入的增加，仍不减少，這是多麼的痛心啊！</p>
<p>唉！其實這種現象，就是不肯重用「國貨」的大毛病，不論那一種物品，或者應用上的，或者純是在消耗上的，總之購買自已所有和製造出來的，比較光榮得多；爲什麼緣故呢？難道堂堂中華民國的人民，舍了外貨，眞是沒有可以壓我的慾望麼？要曉得一個國裏的百姓，不把自已的國貨看重，愛好人家的貨色，這是最羞恥最無思想的暴露，你！苟還知道，今天是中華民國國慶紀念那來：就是昭示大家不要忘掉國本，國本要愛護，「國貨」什麼可以輕視呢？</p>
<h3 id="c163">參觀中國鉛筆廠記 <a href="#c163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>— 天然</p>
<p>一昨記者以中國鉛筆廠廠長吳。君羹梅之招，偕程　西，單揆亞，孫鳳　三君，同赴斜徐路一一七六號該廠參觀，承吳君詳予指導，心得甚多。吳君謂鉛筆製造工業爲化學工業中日用品工業之一種，在各國文具品中，占重要之位置，而與小學生之關係爲尤切。國人以其物微事輕，不甚注意，全國中除九龍大華鉛筆廠以外，未聞有國貨鉛筆之出品，利權外溢，殊堪痛心。査海關貿易冊去年鉛筆輸入，我國達一百五十萬元之鉅，殊足驚人。鉛筆之重要原料，爲木材，筆鉛，粘土。木料則宜用松杉科之當綠喬木，高級鉛筆，木材多產美國，我國東北各省，亦多產生，普通木材，如椴木，紫杉，圓柏，白楊，果松等，華北各省產量均豐可供利用。筆鉛Graphite學名「石墨」我國晋陝魯冀蘇湘閩各省，產最俱富，江蘇省鈸江南京產土狀石墨頗多，惟成分較低，此外湖南之寶座，陝西之秦嶺，其含有率有百分之九十四，此等石墨，最合需用。至粘土Clay則江南地方，隨處可用。以本國富有之原料，與低廉之人工設廠製造，極爲適宜，吳君留學日本研究應用化學時在日本　崎大和鉛筆株式會社實習年餘，於黑鉛筆顏色筆一拷貝鉛筆等之製造，窺其全豹，返國後，籌集資本五萬元，租廠開工，訓練工人之技術，選擇適宜之原料，廠係租用絲廠房屋，極爲寬敞。機械設備，有粘土淘洗設備，及沈澱設備，粘工濾水架，壓濾機，混磨機，鉛心滾壓機，槌製機，鉛心壓製機，十匹馬力電動機，乾燥架，送風機，燃燒爐，磨光機。心槽製造機，烘板機，膠板緊束機，軸板鋸頭機，半面製軸機，成軸機，磨刀機，切光機，油漆機，削軸尾機等。已費一萬五千餘元，大都由順昌廠承製。參觀工作分隸三部，爲木工部，製心部，成品部。木工部包括鋸木，　乾，壓平，製槽等工作。製心部包　配料，研磨過濾，乾燥，軋片，春餅，拉條，烘煉，油浸等工作。成品部包括加心，緊壓，烘乾，磨光，平頭，塗漆，印刷，包裝等工作。自鋸木以至包裝，須經三十餘次之手續。吳君云：全廠開足全車，可日出鉛筆二百籮，目下以出品尙未正式發行，僅出五十籮。商標有鼎牌，飛機牌二種。試用一過，均覺不讓舶來。吾國鉛筆廠，僅中國與大華兩家，總生產量至多日出七百籮，全年約產二千萬籮，全國平均人用一支僅佔二十分之一，尙不足自給。此則有待於力求擴充，以達大量生產之目的，庶每年數百萬元之文具利權，成可挽回若干。今年適値學生國貨年，該廠應運而出，尤爲欣佩。深願學生界與販賣文具者，一致採用是廠出品，以扶植其成，爲國貨文具界開一新紀元也。</p>

<h3 id="c181">第六届全國運動大會開幕 <a href="#c181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>— 會長王世杰</p>
<p>今天是第六屆全國運動大會的第一天、全運會的舉行含有兩個基本目的、一則這種盛大的集會、可以引起全國人民對於體育的强烈注意、一則大會選手所表現的技能、體魄和精神、可給予全國靑年一種良好榜樣、因此、本人對於本屆大個的諸位男女運動員、敬致以下兩種希望、</p>
<p>一、嚴守正當競爭的信念</p>
<p>現代體育的一切運動項目、都以訓練正當競爭爲目的、任何社會、任何事業、無競爭不能進步、有競爭而無正當的規律以範圍、競爭亦决不能進步、所謂正當競爭、在行動方面就是遵守規則、服從裁判、在態度方面、就是勝者不慢不怠、敗者有志有容、</p>
<p>二、充分表現團體合作的能力</p>
<p>現代體育的運動項目中、有一部分的項目、不只是訓練敵與敵間的正當競爭、並目能訓練各個團體自身各部分的合作、足球籃球排球等球類運動、便都是這一類的項目、在敎育的意義上、這一類的運動、較諸其他許多項目尤爲重要、外人批評我國國民性、常常說我國國民、個性强、羣性弱、換句話說、就是合作的能力欠缺、我不相信我國國民的天賦有何特別弱點、我相信人類一切弱點都是敎育或無敎育的結果、我國在歷届遠東運動會中、儘管在田徑賽種種個人比賽項目中得不到特殊成績、足球一項、却屢屢保持優勝的地位、這是我們可以自慰的一件事、由此一事可見外人的批評並不正確、本人極盼望此次參加運動的各單位對於球類運動、都有極大的進步、能充分表現我國靑年團體活動能力的猛進、</p>
<p>以上是本人對於諸位運動員的期望、此外本人希望這次大會的舉行能使我們全國上下、共同致力於以下兩大目標、</p>
<p>第一舉國康强要達到這個目標、我們必須謀體育的普及、從前我們的髒育、在小學中學爲强修科目、在大學則爲自由科目、最近幾年我們已將體育列爲小學中學大學的強修科目了、從前各地沒有民眾運動塲所、近年來政府纔督促各地增設民眾運動塲、以期發展業餘運動、我鬥希望這種工作向前猛進、在最短期間、能使愛好運動的習慣、不只普及於學校靑年、而能普及於老幼男女一切階級、</p>
<p>第二、舉國團結參加這次大會的運動員、有內地各省的同胞、有邊遠地方的同胞、有東北的同胞、有海外各地的僑胞、單位之多、人數之眾、均屬空前狀態、可見國難愈嚴重、凡帶有大中華民族的血液的靑年、擁護國家統一的意志愈顯著愈堅强、任何力量都不能毀滅他、這種意志應該擴充到全國民眾、造成一個舉國團結、以爲大中華民國和大中華民族生存發展的永久保障、</p>
<p>我們的目標旣定、我們更要希望全國負有宣傳責任的機關、尤其是從事新聞電影等事業的機關各各給予體育消息以充分的傳播機會、使舉國康强和舉國團結迅速的成舉爲國宣傳、敬祝這次全運會的成功、</p>
<h3 id="c182">全國運動會之歷史與意義 <a href="#c182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>— 籌備副主任　郝更生</p>
<p>第六屆全國運動大會將於二十四年國慶日舉行於上海市中心區新建之體育塲、全國自有體育集會以來、其組織與設備之能詳盡而比較合理者、自當以本屆為最、惟登高自卑、不有前此五屆大會之導源、難期今日之進展、　榖不談忘佈種、證古可以礪今、更生追懷陳迹、緬談往事、並略言本會舉行之眞實意義、蓋參考比較、爲事業進取之最要過程、且國家社會聚合人材物力以成此盛大之集會、尤須闡揚眞義、使每屆會務留一悠久印象、庶幾一會有一會之價値、而能收循次推進之實效、</p>
<p>一、歷次大會之經過情形　第一屆大會、係民國紀元前二年十月十八日至二十二日舉行於南京、以東南西北中五區爲參加單位、主其事者多外籍敎士、第二屆大會、係民國三年五月二十二日至二十四日舉行於北京、仍多由靑年會西人主持、此兩屆之規章組織、因在草創、自不免幼稚、第三屆係十三年五月二十二日至二十四日舉行於武昌、自本屆起、大會事權始由國人自任、第四屆係十九年八月一日至十日舉行於杭州、實國民政府成立後之第一次全國運動大會、第五屆二十二年十月十日至二十日舉行於首都、會務完全由中央政府主持、</p>
<p>二、已往各屆會務之演進　一二兩屆大會、主動屬於外人、參加者僅居於附和地位、競賽項目與組織規程、未臻完善、會中文告、每用英文刊佈、其時一般人對運動會之感想、雖已不乏眞知灼見之流、然若干觀眾之視此會、殆猶類於春馳秋獵、認爲一時興奮工作、其後十年、第三屆大會舉行於武昌、幹部執事、由國人自理、項目擴充至十種、參加者達十四省區、一切競賽規則、亦漸有條理、而各省區參加此次大會所舉行之預選會、多至三十餘次、連擊之集會旣多、所得效益、自較爲廣遠、其後又六年、浙省府倡辦第四屆大會於杭州、此次雖由浙省邀集開會、但中央政府、隨時予以協助、故參加單位、增至二十有一、各種競賽紀錄、亦突破前格、社會間於運動會之觀念、亦至此一變、不復輕視之如游樂矣、更閱三年、中央政府因首都體育塲建設成功、乃於國慶日召集第五屆大會於南京、參加單位、多至三十有二、選手計二千二百餘人、此爲中央正式籌辦大會之初度、而會務進步、如此之顯著、實爲大會歷史放一新光、綜合已往五屆之逐步進展、下列四點、實爲演進之因、甲、由學校選拔運動員而改爲由社會間選拔運動員、乙、由外籍人士主辦進爲國人主辦、復進爲地方政府與中央政府主辦、丙、由陳舊之競賽項目進爲現代化之競賽方式、一切規章、悉中繩尺、競賽種類、亦漸就齊備、丁、國人對於體育認識、較前深切、而大規模體育集會爲訓練靑年之重要過程、亦漸爲國人所重視、</p>
<p>三、本届大會法規章則之釐訂　已往之全國運動大會、舉行無定期、組織無定章、自本屆大會起、始由敎育部擬具全國運動大會舉行辦法七條、於本年五月五日提經行政院會議通過、並由敎育部根據第五屆大會各項原案訂定本屆大會籌備委員會組織規程、公布施行、而各項比賽規則、均依國內外現時情形、逐一審愼修訂、從此大會章則、著爲軌範、俾斯舉成爲全國有系統之體育集會、而其組織亦得一永久基礎、</p>
<p>四、本届大會舉行之意義　近來各省災惠迭興、即國際間亦正在多事之秋、或謂運動大會之舉行、似不切時需、目爲綏急失宜者、無論亦不爲無見、然世界潮流惡化、我國除民族自强外、寗有他策、而國內災變繁多、亦惟有訓練全民增加合羣及耐勞力量、方可捍災應變、故國步愈艱、則體育之待興愈亟、此實國家百年至計、蓋臨難救濟、猶抱疾求醫、而平時之生聚敎訓、則等於飲食營養、此兩者須等量併視、未可因進藥石而遂罷哺啜、試檢西洋史冊、他國雖値與敵宣戰之時、其國內敎育工作、仍多邁進無阻、我國古代亦有圍城不廢弦誦之訓、現在時艱較深、國人仔肩彌重、大規模之體育集會、正爲訓導全民與淬礪青年之最良有方式、表演則顯示休養精神、競技則造成有勇知恥之習慣、而鍜鍊體格、促進團結、則又爲全會之共同目標、其意義深長、實視任何救時動作爲偉大、至於會塲建築之恢宏、則關係滬市中心建設、供給市民永久享用、當中外觀瞻集中之地、不能不力謀近代化、斯又未便以奢儉之節相繩、</p>
<p>五、本屆大會在滬舉行之特殊意義　上海自通商以來、如此盛大集會、尙爲第一次、地方政府以鉅金興築體育塲所、並拾待全國數十省市之代表選手會於此、其籌備之誠懇與建設之偉大、亦以滬爲首屈一指、况上海市中心區建設、在短期間從行政設施、進而提倡文化發展體育、使旅滬外爲及國內民眾知政府建設力之堅强、引起一般社會對於團體組織之信念、亦爲本屆大會在滬舉行之特殊貢獻、甚願參加大會之同人及眾、一致注意整齊嚴肅、和平奮鬥、以自愛之愛國家、以自重之心重團體、方不負比次大會之慘澹經營、</p>
<p>至於運動技能之進退、在體育普及方面言之、原毋須重視、不過全國運動大會選手、係來自全國各省市、且俱爲經過相當訓練與嚴格選拔之優秀靑年、其活動能力與團體生活之是否善良、其影響於運動技能之處、於此一會中、恰可得一觀察機會、吾人深願各地選手於服從領袖指導之下、切實尊重紀律、精心研習、使我民族自强不息之精神、藉此昭示於全世、庶不負此兼旬之實貴光陰及國人之深厚期待、</p>

<p>實業部長陳公博氏、偕中委王季陸氏、亦於昨日下午二時半、由吳市長及公安局蔡局長陪往大會會塲參觀一週、陳王兩氏、對大會設備週到、頗表滿意、歷時約半小時始返、</p>

<h3 id="c185">競賽規程異點 <a href="#c185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>本屆競賽規程、更改之處極多、茲錄其要點、並出加以說明如下、</p>
<p>個人競技均取六名　本屆田徑賽、游泳及全能運動及國術、每項均改取六名、其分數以七五四三二一計算之、接力亦改取六隊、分數除全能運動之接力、仍照七五四三二計算外、餘均加倍、此項規程之變更、蓋使運動員多取得名次之機會、興趣可以增加含有獎進之意也、否則單位多而人數眾、獲一名次、殊非易事改取六名後、可予運動員以大量之興奮、</p>
<p>各項運動槪取四名　本屆每驢錦標、均須决定其前四名、而規定其得分、得錦標者得四分、亞軍三分、第三得二分、第四得一分、其中田徑全能及游泳、分一二三四、毫無問題、球類因參加隊數之多、仍採用淘汰制、而在淘汰制中、分別冠軍亞軍及第三第四、故本屆球類比賽之編排秩序、皆經過鄭重考慮、使最强之各隊、能得到達複賽也、</p>
<p>球類名位判分方法　球類皆採淘汰制、網球除外、最後决賽優勝者爲冠軍、得鎮標、亞軍及第三第四名位之產生、係以複賽週中之另三隊、再賽一次、或二次决定之、其方法如下、</p>
<p>甲隊得錦標冠軍、甲隊之外、乙丙丁、尚須另行比賽、以定第二第三第四、先使複賽失敗之兩隊比賽（乙丁）、失敗者爲第四名如丁失敗、則丁第四、乙與丙再行比賽一次、勝者爲第二、敗者爲第三、如果乙丁之賽、乙失敗則乙第四、丁第三、丙第二、因丙已在複賽中、敗於丙、故不須再賽也、</p>
<p>綱球錦標方法更改　網球錦標、</p>
<p>本屆不採單位之集體淘汰法、而改用單打雙打個別淘汰法、而將各單位在單打雙打中之名位與成績、合併計算之、以分別錦標隊冠軍亞軍第三第四也、每單位參加者、仍爲兩單打與一雙打、單打選手、亦可兼作雙打、如此單打選手集合一起、雙打亦另行集合一起、旣可一瞻全國網球選手單打最强之數人、及雙打最强之數組、又可保持上屆單位對單位之單打一雙打之集體淘汰法之固有精神、而各單位在單雙打中之成績與名位、再由競賽委員會判定冠軍亞軍及第三第四、</p>

<p>本屆網球錦標之規程、係本屆新定、而將歷屆之比賽方法根本變換、第四屆之比賽方法、係採台維斯杯制、二單打二交換單打及一雙打、第五屆在南京之比賽方法、則又更改、分二單打及一雙打、單打選手、不能兼賽雙打、開網球比賽未有之先例、今年之比賽方法、則全部改革、採個人分別淘汰法、雙打則隊別淘汰法、非一單位對一單位比賽、乃個人與個人間之比賽、將單打選手及雙打隊、樊合一起、作單雙打比賽、然後再從每一單位之代表、在單雙打中所　之成績如何、再定奪綿標之淮屬、男女同樣方法、</p>
<p>本屆比賽方法之優點、此方法之優點、即在分別各隊之成收髙下外、復可判別各個選手之成績、以定全國選手之名位、照規程之决定、得單打冠軍者、爲第一名、複賽失敗者、互相比賽、以定第四名、此塲之勝者、與决賽之失敗者比賽、以定第二第三名、故如此比賽方法、編排秩序、關係十分重大、務必使其中最强之四個單打選手能到達複賽、否則强者與强者在初週即遇、互相淘汰、即失此新比賽方法之原來意義、</p>
<p>第一第二單位之分別　據大會籌委會第二次通告之第五項第八條、通告各單位綱球選手之報名註册、應依各選　手技術之髙下、照第一單打第二單打等次序塡寫、分成第一單打及第二單打、故本屆大會之秩序冊、網球秩序、即不列選手名姓、而僅書第一單打第二單打、照大會之通吿、則第一單打之技術、勝於第二單打、爲極明顯之事實、</p>
<p>本屆秩序編排之可異　但所可異者、奉秩序之編配、竟將各單位之第一單打、全列入一方面、而第二單打、亦全部另行列入一方面、則比賽之結果、勢必好手與好手先行相遇、次等選手與次等選手相遇、在左面淘汰之結果、剩一第一單打之最佳者、在右面則淘汰成一第二單打之最佳者、些一人舉行决賽、若此安能定奪個人名位、第一名問無問題、二三四名將若之何、因第一單打之統共列入一起、若干較佳者、俱已事先淘汰、則些二三四名之决定、安得謂之公平、</p>

<h3 id="c201">籌備經過略述 <a href="#c201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>民國二十二年第五屆全國運動會、旣决定自第六屆起、在首都與各省市間隔二年舉行一次、又因民國二十五年（一九三六）第十一屆世界運動會將舉行於德京柏林、爲謀便利選拔及訓練起見、故決定第六屆大會、舉行於上海、水市吳市長鐵城遂開始積極籌備、蓋上海爲通商要地、中外觀瞻所繫、不可不有你大之設備、又因照遠東運動大會原定之會期、第十一屆遠東運動大會應於民國二十六年（一九三七）在我國上海舉行、故建築一完備之市體育塲、尤爲最當務之急、吳市長乃於本市財政艱難之中、仍努力計劃、市體育塲亦於去秋典基開始建築、今已如期於會期前完成、富麗爲皇、當推遠東之冠、此寶市長努力之結果也、</p>
<p>第六屆全運大會會期、旣定本年雙十節起至十月二十日止、在市中心區市體育塲舉行、敎育部乃聘請籌備委員凡四十三人、組織籌備委員會、計劉籌備、並聘請上海市市長吳鐵城爲籌備主任、市敎育局局畏潘公展及敎育部體育督學郝更生副之、沈嗣良爲總幹事、馬崇淦邵汝幹蔣湘靑吳邦偉副之、四月八目、由敎部召集全體籌委、於上海市政府舉行第一次籌備會議、籌備委員會亦即於此時、正式成立、設籌備處於上海市敎育局數月以來、籌委努力進行、不遺餘力、第六屆全國運動大會亦於今日在市體育塲開幕、不得不使吾人欽佩當局之熱心提倡與努力也、</p>

<h3 id="c202">談談各錦標競爭形勢 <a href="#c202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>張伯苓和一般的專門學者、都主張取消錦標和總錦標、錦標確是一種虛偽的東西、可以縣長運動員的驕矜、也是一切糾紛的肇端、然而這動員、羣眾、或對錦標得失有關係的各該集團、最大的注意力還是在「錦標」二字上、即使錦標的名義取消、它的實質一定還是存在的、我敢斷定的說、現在「姑妄言之」地就把這次各項錦標的競爭情形、隨便的談談、</p>
<p>田徑全能</p>
<p>上屆冠軍是上海市包辦的、這次呢、顯然仍舊可以保持着過去的光榮、論人材、上海沒有什麼特殊的、但很平均、每項節目參加的四人、都有得分的希望、至少在每項運動中、不致吃着鴨蛋、劉長春雖供職托南京、但他仍舊不忘已落在敵人掌握裏的故鄉、所以道次他仍以東北名義來代表遼寗參加、在南京方面、不能不說是一種巨大的損失、否則和柳英俊的髙中欄等、着實可以得點分數、</p>
<p>東北李世明的四百米和八百米、是很有希望的、「山西老」的一萬米、有包辦的可能性、福建的林紹洲（高欄）戴淑國（四百米、）自參加靑島夏令營後、不知怎的歸併到上海市來了、倒爲一海市充厚實力不少、可是上海的短跑第一流選手程金冠、代表江蘇去了、在上海方面、這又受了重大的損失、</p>
<p>馬來亞的傅金城、原也是在上海的、成績並不怎樣特殊可是返歸星洲後、兩年來的努力、四百米的成績進步不少、一百米二百米平平而已、廣東趙秉恒、北平孫月明、在短跑方面、都有點小名、但實力是分散了、</p>
<p>縱然上海市第一的名將得得不多、但人材是這樣的平均、陣容是這樣的鞏固、我們很自信地預祝這最後的勝利、</p>
<p>田賽和徑賽是一樣的雖然鐵牛陳寶球跑向湖北云了、可是不能影響到上海市寶座、唯一的勁敵是北平、</p>
<p>全能運動也是上海和北平的對抗比賽、張齡佳就算奪了十項的第一去、可是五項和兩項接力、上海可以穩操勝券的、</p>
<p>在這裏不能詳說每項競技的戰陣、總而言之、這三項錦標是上海的口中肉、</p>
<p>女子田徑</p>
<p>說到女子田徑賽、上海可以必勝無欵、錢行素、李森、潘　初、焦玉蓮、陳亞春、盧淑、還有記不起的許多巾幗好漢、唯一的勁敵是廣東和馬華但廣東女將、祇能跑、不能跳、也不能擲、不足以競錦標、馬華姑娘鄧銀嬌的跳遠、似可穩得第一、她的五十米百米和二百米、和上海廣東的女將、都在水平綫上、要看競爭後再說、葛玉蓮的跳高、是很有希望、但都不足以攻破上海鐵軍的陣容、</p>
<p>男女游泳</p>
<p>男子游泳是香港廣東的閱牆戰、上次冠軍是廣東、這次兩埠的實力、大多是以前的幾位水將成績都很進步、但人員却分散得平均起來、不能斷定誰强誰弱、</p>
<p>粤港之外、還須注意到南海水蛙、陳渭水（南海美人魚楊安妮的胞弟）王亞九、曾一再創迭全國新紀錄、少不得要和粤港健兒一决雌雄、還有菲律賓也有三位選手參加、據說實力也很不惡、上海今年是比在南京時體面得多了、鴨蛋之恥、穩可滌浣、然猶只能得分、不足以首錦標、</p>
<p>女子游泳香港包辦無疑、廣東固亦有不少好手、尙不足以撼其鋒、可惜馬來亞楊妮女士沒有來、否則當不致讓楊秀瓊專美於前、</p>
<p>足球錦標</p>
<p>足球、都興奮的足球比賽、尤其是取配上海人的胃口、球王李惠堂東山再起、轉土重來、前哨已經接觸過了、十比零大破西捕、賺得球迷們發狂、申園擠得水洩不通、無立錐之地、爲了靈谷大會、上　徼倖得了錦標、所以今年香港用最精銳的隊伍、要誓報此仇、</p>
<p>香港是抱了必勝之心、李惠堂也處處暗不要想奪得錦標、可是還得防着背後螳螂的爪牙、廣東隊、眞是香港的唯一大敵、</p>
<p>廣東香港固然是大家最注意的了、上海球迷、向來是醉慕座隊的名將、球員的姓名眞是如雷貫耳、聽得熟了、這次所有好手、出乎意外的都來了、球迷是要怎樣的歡　和雀躍、</p>
<p>馬華的足球也夙負盛名、前年兩次返國、給予國內人士深刻的印象、况這次的人選、將全馬來島所有好手羅致無遺、實力之强、可想而知的了、上海方面已爲本埠人士所熟稔、雖然在四次練習賽中、都得到勝利、可是大敵當前、猶未可樂得、</p>
<p>除上述諸隊外、河北也未可小　、天津中華隊的球藝、早已口碑載道、華北足球運動新興時代的一支鐵軍、</p>
<p>照秩序、最後複賽、大致爲香港遇馬華、廣東對上海、廣東原是理想中香港的决賽對手、不意四騎士缺席、實力减色、在廣東以爲很僥倖的遇到上海、而上海也認爲是喜出望外的、是以滬粤兩隊實力、可說是旗鼓相當、彼此都懷着僥偉的希望心、然而奪　呼聲、允推香港最高、</p>
<p>男子籃球</p>
<p>自上屆全運錦標隊河北選手風流雲散後、籃球的形勢、隨着轉變了、</p>
<p>南京的籃球運動、近年來突飛猛晋、國體中央軍校、還有其他的私人集團、球藝多精强得可以、更以從前河北隊的唐賀堃李震中等國手加入、實力更是雄厚、今番的男子籃球錦標、定是南京市的口中肉、囊中物、</p>
<p>足興南京一决雌雄的、祇有湖北隊、可惜兩隊就相會於决賽中、另一部份則以靑島爲最有希望、此外北平也不弱、河北都新進、上海是落伍了女子籃球上海向來是視爲禁臠的、這次的自信力依然很强、錦標是看得十分容易、</p>
<p>福建由羣惠爲主力軍、該隊會遠征菲律賓和南洋、博得盛譽、上海的基本隊兩江、也曾一度敗於其手、</p>
<p>靈谷勝會、最後决賽、上海僅以一分之差、擊敗福建、而得錦標、想起當時决戰情形、至今獨有餘悸、說不定這次冠亞軍之爭、仍不出滬閩兩隊、而可怕的局面、亦難免重演、</p>
<p>綱球錦標</p>
<p>紙球也和足球一樣地富有興趣、各處名將全體參戰、况目本屆網球奪標方法改換、不採單位集體淘汰制、而把單打與雙打分開比賽、差不多可稱是全國網球等級比賽、因此可以知道全國單打最强的是那幾人、雙打最强的是那幾組、所以興趣更覺濃厚、競爭亦必劇烈、爪哇名將許承基、球藝如何、盡人皆知、自今年美國參加台杯賽回來後、更突飛猛進、國內恐無敵手、單打冠軍大有非君莫屬、雙打也極有希望、馬夾亞的左手將軍林望蘇和陳其安、都精於此道、林會一度華敗林寶華和邱飛海、可見其球藝之一證、陳則爲去年馬來亞單打冠軍、當然也有相當的本領、所以對此錦標也頗思染指、</p>
<p>四川的王文正和香港的徐煒培、也不可小視、王自到滬後、連勝邱林、而徐亦於上海會之表演賽中、小挫林望蘇、上屆錦標上海隊、本屆雖有林邱二老將、但人老珠黃、對此錦標實未許樂觀、再看女子隊中亦有不少英雄、上屆錦標山西隊、仍舊由王春莆藏兩姐妹出塲、賽力甚爲雄厚、很能保持以往光榮、上海隊人材平均、梁茅諸子、無庸介紹、大概都可知道、魏氏姊妹花、更爲出色、破釜沉舟、頗思一雪金陵之辱、其餘如南京北平四川馬來亞等、也濟濟多士、各具相當寶力、究竟鹿死誰手、目看將結果、</p>
<p>男女排球</p>
<p>男女排球、本屆參加奪標單位、男子部共十一五隊、女子部共十一隊、男初賽今日下午一時三時有兩塲比賽、女初賽須明日序幕、今日兩塲、擺定鬆脆局面將來上海浙江香港相見方成正衝突、女排球、本爲南國健兒之禁臠、自上屆格突變、反使上海雄心勃勃、但君子復仇、三年不遲、故廣東香港之勝者、必爲無上勁敵、而江蘇隊以無錫蘇州會合之師、瞿美英馮玉珍輩、又係多年宿將、寄語滬琢、小心謹愼、</p>
<p>棒球壘球</p>
<p>棒球一項、在國內尙未抵普遍化時期、各單位之參加者、不及其他項目之熱烈、全國運動會自第三屆起、方有此項比賽、華北即首執牛耳、第三屆華東起而代之、霸權乃自北移東、第四届又自東而移至華南、歸諸香港、上屆第五屆則爲廣東霸佔、本屆參加共有湖南河北上海廣東北平五隊、自十一日下午三時起、計比賽六塲、各方觀察、頗屬望於粤·平·滬·三隊、大有三角鼎立之形勢、但河北實力、亦不可漠視、</p>
<p>女子（壘球）一項、始自第五屆、第一次錦標　諸廣東、本屆參加者六隊、即廣東·山東·南京·河北·江蘇·上海·按諸實力、廣東雖其有保持霸權之壯志、而各隊暗中逐鹿者頗多、尤以上每雄心最大、非經劇戰、難分先後、比賽始自十一日下午一時、前後相戰紙六塲耳、</p>
<h3 id="c203">綱球表演賽　林望蘇和卡遜　九比九因雨停止 <a href="#c203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>上海網球會於昨日下午三時特約馬來亞網球名將林望蘇、與本市草地網球單打冠軍卡爾生、作表演賽於康悌路球塲、並有邱飛海王文正對楊倫章阮國英之雙打賽、邱王與楊阮之實力懸殊、故成一面倒之局勢、結果邱王以六比四六比三連勝兩盤、繼之登塲者、爲林卡之單打、是時適天不作美、雨下如珠、但仍冒雨舉行、惟第一盤戰至各九平手時、天色黑暗、就此和局而散、</p>

<p>第四第五兩屆、僅設總錦標、而對於獲錦標數次多之單位、並無若何表示、故本屆大會爲增加競爭興趣起見、决議於總錦標之外、添設總第二總第三及總第四、其分別之法、乃合計各單位在各種錦標中得分多寡之總數分別之、凡各種錦標得分合計之最多者得總錦標、其次得總第二、再次得總第三及總第四、如兩個或兩個以上之單位、總分相等、則視其錦標數之多寡分判之、如果錦標數仍相等、則以所得亞軍之多寡判分之、依次類推、女子部如果總分相等、則得田徑賽錦標者得總錦標、或以田徑賽錦標中名位之先後判分之、是亦與以往兩屆最大不同之點也、</p>

<p>粵代表隊昨約戰本埠英聯隊於申園球塲延平路一帶、車水馬龍、頓成熱鬧、作壁上觀者約八千餘人、結果粤隊以十二對零大勝英聯、粤隊連絡純熟、表演精彩、尤以譚江柏活躍全塲、獨中七球之多、可以媲美球王、餘如楊水益奔跑迅速、射門准確、中堅劉慶材、穩健老練、接濟前錄攻擊力不少、後衛及守門、因英聯攻擊力薄弱、大有生意淸淡之槪、反無特殊表演、茲錄戰况如下、</p>

<p>— 邵元冲</p>
<p>爲二十四年雙十節作</p>
<p>當此矢崩地坼，河山易色之時，而歲歲强幾爲飲以度此愁慘之雙十國慶，國人之感想爲何如？當此禍烈於東晋，患深於南宋，東縛逾於大戰後之德意志，而一迴憶及於二十四年前開國時之今日，其勇敢壯烈之精神，動天地，泣鬼神，舉一切危難障碍，皆不足以　吾之心者，持較今日之屛息怵惕，視人之顏色喜怒以爲欣戚者，其感想又爲何如？然今日爲民族存亡危機一髡之時，斤斤譴責，無裨時艱，而所欲再三反覆，陳說於我國人之前者，乃如何從平實可行之途，以共致力於當前救亡之大業。</p>
<p>救亡之道萬端，然其要義則在使人人各能有所致力，其致力能均平而普遍，切實而有效。蓋救亡之業，爲國民人人其有之事，共有之責，則必須人人能盡其責，及砥身　行，以從事於勤勞，以勞其身，勞其心，勞其志，勞其插始。綜檢已往禍敗之原，何以政竄敎廢俗偸民愚，多大言而少條理，多議論而少成功，多浮辭而無心得，多淺涉而無深造，多作輟而少專精，皆偸惰之習爲之也。惰者畏難畏勞，苟便易而怯艱苦，風氣所趨，政事則務苟且，敎育則流淺薄，事業則驚外形，工作則苦　陋，而物質浮華，飲博聲色，淫佚之過，則比比焉。夫人之精神時間有限也，而嗜慾則無限。人類之弱點爲好逸惡勞，無以節制而矯正之，則日趨於偸惰而不反。勤則善心生，惰則邪心生，以今日國危族累卵，民陷於沸湯之際，而曾不動心，惟是酣歌屢舞，耗時曠職，則豈得謂之有人心。昔陶侃當東晋危難之時，以勤勞爲百僚率，所屬有博弈者，則投其員旞江，以爲是牧猪奴戲，然今日之朝野，能不爲牧猪戲者幾者乎？襲自珍日：「衰世朝無才相，庠序無才土，隴無才民，　無才工，衢無才商」者，非預爲仿日言之乎？夫立國數千年，危難之來，何代蔑有，然曆覽往史，凡國之能救亡復興者，必能上下一心，奮其憂勤惕厲之精神，以戰勝艱危者也。其　遇外患而一蹶不振者，必意志消沉，苟且委靡，不能愧恥振作者也。成敗之鑒，開卷朗然，則今日而以勤勞救亡之義，瘡口　音，以吿國人者，或非迂拙之議乎？</p>
<p>爲治之道首在補偏而救弊，故國奢則示之以儉，民惰則示之以勤。勤之要義，則勤其精神焉，勤其時間焉，勤其生活焉，勤其行爲焉，勤其求知焉，勤其服務焉，勤其天職焉，此其大端已。蓋精神不勤，則營營擾擾，無所歸宿，而放惰之行著焉，必使精神有所附屬，於事業，於智識，於修養，而後精神乃入於正軌。時間不勤則浪費，生活不勤則　侈，行爲不勤則九假。乃至現代民族之興衰，基於民智之高下，現代興國之基本，在於學術之發揚，則勤於求知其本也。以今日政治敎育建設以至一切事業之窳陋委靡，民族意識之消沉，則鼓舞人人之責任心，而勤於其本身之服務及國民之天職，俾精神不振，耳目一新，此又亟亟而不可緩焉。在易之乾，其（象爲自强不息，而周書之稱文王勤於國事也，則曰：「自朝至於日中昃，不遑暇食，用咸和萬民」，孟子之稱周公，則曰：「周公思兼三王，以施四事，其有不合者，仰而思之，夜以繼日，幸而得之，坐以待旦，」此皆以勤立國之鑒也。又若昔賢之鷄鳴戒旦，錢镠之圓枕警寐，凡事業有成者，及方興之民族，莫不平時則以勤勞立國，處變則以勤勞救亡，一念之勤惰，而興亡頓異，比不可不深思長念者也。</p>
<p>吾國以勤勞謀國之先哲，歷史上比比皆是，然其最足動吾人之景慕者，則莫若大禹與墨子，大禹胼手胝足以治洪水者十九年，水患旣奠，猶屢巡狩以勞民事，而崩於會稽。墨子苦身勞形，尙儉節欲，以期濟民而定亂，至於塺頂放踵以利天下而不辭，此其勞苦之精神，足以鍼砭衰世而風示末俗者爲何如。若國人率能以墨子自期，爲政者務以大禹互勉，風氣所趨，俗習一變，以勤勞之義挽危亡，以禹墨之精神矯弊習，則救亡復興，一綫生機實繫於此矣。</p>

<p>— 章倬漢</p>
<p>在世界風雲萬分險惡的今日過國慶紀念，有感覺的國民，大槪不能不因國家的產生，而想到牠的生存問題吧！</p>
<p>表示國家生有能力的，是國勢調査。但在今日的中國，地區這樣遼廓，統計調査事業又正在萌芽時期，那裏談得到有這項文伴的發表？况對內則勦匪未竟全功，對外則防人伺察窺探，旣有若干材料，又豈能無顧忌地盡最披露？坐是，國人要澈底的明白國情，或討論國事，都戚覺缺乏充分的參考材料。求之國籍，則版以後，已非動的中國的眞象；求之報章，則參差零星，亦難作爲依據。近年以來，國內人士談國情的，爲實際關係，只能借材外人所編的中國軍鑑，其弊在原書隔膜乖誤，無從是正：其對東西文學無閱覽能力的人者，個人搜求材料，更苦時間精力的耗糜過多。申報前總經理史量才先生，有見及此，乃於館内設置年鑑部，刋行申報年鑑，冀在可能範圍內，廣徵各項材料，委託專家選纂，印行一種較合實用之普通性質的年鑑。作者同任主編之役，三年以來，頗歷艱苦，大槪說來：各項初步材料，少的旣患片面不全，多的又患紛歧不一。有時表面現象，不能代表內容，有的陳腐材料，已失應用價値；而向各方調査事物，尋覓材料時，有的盛意見答，而與他種材料參閱，發見矛盾，有的忙於本職，或珍視秘藏，竟未予裁覆，我們竭徵求訪詢之勞，盡參核覆算之力，更幸許多專家，不惜分力相助，得勉成三册申報年鑑，將逐年的國事，成整個的綜括報吿，以貢獻我需要此項出版物的各界人士。惟每冊分量各在千三百面以上，字數則每册在百五十萬至二百萬之間，如此巨帙，考査雖稱便利，簡明則未敢言。現在趁這慶祝國慶之便，更節要　篇，行女材料，頗參用各書，惟關於已載申報年鑑者，則註明原刋頁碼，以資詳査。</p>
<p>以下將我國現勢分疆土，人口，國力三部分說明。</p>
<p>（一）中國疆土及其地利</p>
<p>土地爲國家的重要某礎，中國的所以被稱爲大國，地區廣大，已算一種因素。中國的疆土，爲四千萬餘英方里，合三千三萬餘萬華方里，以公方里言，其詳數爲一一，一七三，五五八·（年鑑土地編有各省區詳遠。這區域，分二十八省，（共一千九百四十縣，四十五設治局）六直轄市，四特別行政區及勞　二地方，使行統治，可稱泱泱大國。全世界各國統治的疆土，除俄英（連屬地）二國外，旣法美國兩連屬地計算，也遝不及。東隣日本，則僅及我百分之六、（年鑑有比較表。）</p>
<p>這裏，先從政治上觀察，外蒙西藏二地方，可不待言，東北四省，勢成淪陷，新疆，靑海，或則鞭長莫及，或則統治機關尙未完整政治關係最密切的有只二十一省，（形勢，看下來就可澈底的白：</p>
<p>區域　面積方公里　佔全面積百分數</p>
<p>中國總面積一一·一七三·五五八一〇〇</p>
<p>新疆外　靑海西康西藏五·三六〇·三六七五九</p>
<p>東北四省失地一·二八五·〇六九</p>
<p>內地二十一省四·五二八·一二二四一</p>
<p>照此，我國現在政治上關係密切的疆士，比之全士一千多萬方里，要打個六折，還算怎樣大嗎？</p>
<p>再看中國國權行使於領土上是怎樣？各國在北平（東交民巷）天津，上海，漢口，九龍，廣州灣等處，如棋布子的，設了許多租界，那是外人經濟和政治力的根據地，何異設了許多敵國，伸進魔手，更甚的，在上海天津等江海各口岸，外艦外兵，自由進出，我不得而過問。至於普通外人所到處又向不受我治，一九三二年國聯會中，有人慨歎：中國沒有疆界了。我們大家都明免有這感慨！</p>
<p>更次，就土地的利用上說，倘使那二十一省，都是良好的十地，也罷，可惜還有問題。</p>
<p>據專家觀，土地最有利於人生的高度是在五百公尺以下，五百至一千公尺的就不很好了，千尺至二三千尺的高地能否開發，還成問題，三千公尺以上就等於石田。那末試看看中國地勢的百分數（以下用全國總面積作一百分：）</p>
<p>地勢　百分數　地勢　百分數</p>
<p>五百公尺以下一四平原一〇</p>
<p>五百至一千公尺一八盆地一六</p>
<p>一千至二千公尺〇八山地〇九</p>
<p>一千至四千四〇高原三四</p>
<p>四千公尺以上二〇山脈三〇</p>
<p>右表，中國最好的土地不過百分之十四，連次等地算，不過百分之三十二，僅及全國總面積三分之一，如用平原盆地計算，止有百分之二十六，還要减去其中東北四省約十分之一，那是連六折都不到了。（年鑑二十三年B三一，二十四年B二五）所以中國如果一旦外患更增，沿海沿江各省財富之區，受人侵略，只保存那西北高地，則比宋朝南逸還危險呢。</p>
<p>（二）中國的人口問題</p>
<p>近年我國人口，幾次的調査和估計，雖然數自不很一致，然而大槪四萬萬六千餘萬，是近於準確的（年鑑二十四年B八九。）中國在前淸乾隆年間，旣有四萬萬人之稱，那末現在一百多年間的增殖率，已有百分之十五。雖然新疆，甯夏，西康，靑海，等處每方公里平均不過一人强。（年鑑二十四年八八不過那些多是高原山嶺沙漠，生物難以存活的所在。那肥沃宜於人生的三分之一的土地，約計三，七二四，五一六方公里，照二十一省現有的人口算，已有四一五，一八〇，五四一人，每方公里平均就有一百十一人强，密度比歐美大得多。此等土地，除江河湖泊城市道路等所佔面積外，已開墾的農田，據專家估計，每人平均分配，不過四畝强（年鑑B三二。）比起北美的每人五十二畝，蘇俄的每人十四畝，差得很遠。家窮人口多，便是中國被壓在貧乏綫上的原因了</p>
<p>人口膨脹的結果，謀生止有三途：（一）向外尋殖民地，（二）展拓國內資源，（三）勵行工業化，將勝餘貨品向國外覓銷路。若就年鑑材料，一加審察，則第一種是此後三五十年中也不用夢想，連華僑在外的勢力，都將被人剷盡，（詳二十四年年鑑R五—一六）而國內可以移民的東北，現在也斷送了，反有多少難民，入關求活。第二第三兩種，雖有可能，但在目下，則有遠水救不得近火的形勢。蓋縱然政局立刻安定，產業開發，更假定在一，二十年內，人口增加趨勢緩和，亦離有較寬裕的生活。倘若人口加多，那更難了。地狹人稠，物資缺乏，除藉循環內亂以爲調節外，止有過食不飽衣不足的生活。生活旣簡陋，文化也自然無法提高了。國勢也難以向上發展了。</p>
<p>（三）中國的國力</p>
<p>國力的檢討，可分爲經濟的（旣生存力）和社會的（旣防衛力），茲僅就生存力說明如下。（關於防衛力最近情形，因關軍事秘密，不能綜述，舊的可參閱二十三年申報年鑑）</p>
<p>生存的資源，從土地來。中國的土地生產，現在最大宗是農產品，其次是鑛產。</p>
<p>農產現時最重要的是食糧，其次是棉。全國常年糧食產額，統計如下（年鑑二十年K四·單位千市祖）：</p>
<p>二十省區糧食常年產量可供食用實數</p>
<p>秈梗稻一（二）〇二七、七四六四二一、四五八</p>
<p>小麥四五八、二〇八三三九、〇七四</p>
<p>粱小米玉米甘薯八〇一、六八一四七二、八〇一</p>
<p>稻製精米，每担約成五斗，而各種食糧，還須留充籽種及家畜飼料等用，其充人食糧的百分數各有不同，（年鑑二十四年K二一）折實如上數。總計二十一省的人口是三七五·一七一·五七四人，每人每年約需米或麥兩担半，那末：</p>
<p>每年米麥短少一萬萬餘担，固然雜糧已在補充了，不過上述的是常年例，實際頻年水旱災害，無或間息，各種食糧又互有升降，所以外米外麥和鈣粉每年入超就不少了。</p>
<p>進口類別民元年民十年民二十三年</p>
<p>（千担）（千担）（千公担）（折合千旧担）</p>

<p>麺麥三、二〇二七五三五九六＝＝九九八</p>
<p>計五、九〇五一一、四六三一二、九五六＝＝二一、七〇八</p>
<p>（詳年鑑二十三年·子七四·二四年·子八八）</p>
<p>以上三項二十三年份進口一千二百九十多萬公担，即合二千一百七十多萬奮担。二十三年的進口，還是比較少的，民十一到二十一年，逐年的進口，還比這多出約一倍。試想佔全國戶數百分之七十四的農戶，　種非不勤，拓地非不多，而生活起碼約食食，還不能自給，其問題難道不嚴重？</p>
<p>其次是棉產，中國的棉產量，民二十二年二十省分二二·三九三·〇〇〇市担，二十三年一四·八九五·〇〇〇市担。進出口値如下：</p>
<p>外棉進口國棉出口</p>
<p>民二十一年値（國幣）民二十三年値（國幣）外棉進口九八、二〇六、二〇六、〇七一九〇、二四六、五九八國棉出口三〇、二二八、九九八一五、二〇〇、八七九</p>
<p>這是民衣的原料缺乏，如合進口的棉紗棉布呢羢一類被服料計算，民國二十三年年的入超，近一萬萬元。這是衣食兩大要素全不能自給的情形。</p>
<p>就上述情形贊成的農民經濟狀况言，則民元以來內地二十一省佃農自耕農和半耕農的消長，如下表：</p>
<p>農類民元年民二十二年</p>
<p>佃農二八％三一％</p>
<p>自耕農四九％四五％</p>
<p>牟耕農二三％二三％</p>
<p>這可以顯示農人逐漸失了田地而降爲苦力。失田地的原因，是貧窮而種田收益不够生活，或受時局影響及士劣壓迫所致。佃農漸多，而地主漸大，社會問題就愈加糾紛了。再看江浙皖這種富腴之區，農民經濟狀况怎樣。據白克調査，浙江所屬八縣的農民平均收支，有餘的僅佔百分之十四，收支不相抵的有百分之五十九，又中國北部中部六省十三處二千三百七十家農民，每一成年農民男子每年生活費用，平均止有四十九元六角，這種的貧乏，如再加不時的苛徵，農民直難存活。無論在勦匪上言，從前代變亂歷史言，農民的貧苦問題，都是最重要而須求解决的。（雖然近年合作盛行二三年度放欵約一千二百萬元，但這是補小洞的辦法，禁不起今年的一下子大水）。</p>
<p>中國的鑛產，從前外人估計的，失之過多，近據地質調査所的實地査勘，媒鑲雖不算富，也不算很窮。鵭銻郤估世界鑛產中重要地位。錫也不少。可惜現代國家富强所繫的鐵及石油等鑛，雖有儲臧，開採不多。許年鑑年二十四年（K四—二四）</p>

<p>石油三、二七四淣桶一千桶二、四一一萬加侖二零萬加侖</p>
<p>柴油—————————二三萬加侖———一—</p>
<p>我國煤炭儲量，佔世界第二位。但以人口計，每人止有五百噸。比美國的每人一萬噸。英國的每人四千噸，德人的一千五百噸都不及。止勝於日本每人一百噸罷了。近年的媒產量，大約三百萬噸以內。但是開澳撫順居大半。從東北被奪，煤的消費就靠許多入口，民二十三年入超四百八十多萬元。鐵鑛北有廉價的鑛砂出口，而鋼鐵就靠舶來。二十三年入超八千多萬元。石油國內雖有儲藏，而開發不利，二十三年入口也有八千多萬元，銻鎢錳鋅等雖多，然有鑛不能增產，產亦不能自用，若依賴出口，不但受外人操縱，並且自己寳藏供他人做原料，於經濟也是不利的，</p>
<p>其次，生存力的增設，是靠工商業。</p>
<p>工業本來是現代國家經濟發展的樞機，所以先進國的生產，都工業化了。旣如農業，雖有天然的限制，他們也可以利用科學和機械，使它儘量的增產。中國從甲午戰敗後早已提倡工業，近年又在力謀工業化，然而基本的工業，如製鋼造機械煉銅煉油製酸鹹等，還沒有相當的基礎，現在較活動的無非些輕工業和小工業，試和日本國內各工業作一比較如次。（一年鐵二十二年M二二六，二十四年Ⅰ一—二七，四一）、</p>

<p>飲食工業四〇五一二，七二八</p>
<p>電氣工業五六二·五〇八</p>
<p>以上電氣工業最發達，不過多是電燈廠。以中國地方之大，電氣工廠五百多家不算多。紡織工廠是民十丸年調査數最近連小廠併計，凡絲，棉，毛，針織等廠，合共不過一千家。如就大廠的情形而論，也不很好，試看民國二十三年的統計：</p>
<p>華商廠數雖多而貨本反不及日廠之厚。然而許多國』內的紗布，還不够供給我們的衣着，每年仍靠大量進口。如民二十三年：</p>

<p>絨綫一二，七三二——</p>
<p>呢羢一四，四一七——</p>
<p>入超計九九，七六七千元</p>
<p>至於商業，中國是被動的。如運銷歐美貨品，是靠外人採辦，而不能直接輸出；對國內商業，沒有關稅的保護，除外貨以低關稅進口外，外人又得設廠於國內各口岸，華商無法競爭。去年貿易入超四萬萬九千四百萬元，前年達七萬萬三千多萬元，如此情形，市面又安得不哀落？（年鑑二十四年　七七）。</p>
<p>凡以上農工商業的萎靡，原因是（一）國內秩序的不安定，地方屢經人禍，而且不及預防天災，各種事業動　破壞。或受經濟衰落影響，不能支持。資本的短少，各種企業，沒有雄厚的財力，一遇風波，便被搖動。（三）技術不精。如農業的守　，工業的工程方法工率，成本計劃不精製煉方法不細，工人的智能體力品性低劣，往往綫成失敗。（四）企業家眼光短淺，貪圖淺利，不肯做遠大的計書。而政府保護的手段又很薄弱。倘使國營官辦，失敗更快。並且各種事業有相輔性，在一股專業襄頹之下，一二種事業又不易單獨發達，因此外資也無從利用，内費又漸流都市，留下一片枯槁無生氣的內地內日漸看他經濟崩潰，人民流離，而中國人的生存力，好比在癆病喘息之中，危乎不危？</p>
<p>更　交通工具觀察。近年對於公路建股建可稱努力；而如鐵路航輪等發展農工商業的工具，與各國比較，未免相形見拙拙了。</p>

<h3 id="c218">意阿事件的經過 <a href="#c218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>— 馮仲足</p>
<p>阿比西尼亞本來是在列强利益關係的牽製中生存着。一九零六年，英法意三大帝國主義國家因爲在阿國的利權衝突無法達到平均的分配，不得已訂結了保證阿比西尼亞獨立的三邊條約，一面承認阿國的獨立和領土完整，一面互認彼此在阿國的特殊權利。一九二五年英意擬訂立秘密恊定，雙方互相默認在阿國作更進一步的經濟侵略，阿國險些兒遭了瓜分之禍，幸而阿國得着法國的幫助，將這洩漏的消息在國聯中死力提出反對，英意這纔出來聲明並無侵略之意，而協定也就流產了。可是意大利侵阿的野心郤未嘗稍减。牠改變了方策，假性惺地去跟阿國修好，一九二八年與阿國締訂所謂友好條約，規定兩國如有糾紛須先交付仲裁，並相約彼此互不侵犯領土的完整。意大利原想借此討好阿國，以便逐漸侵入，奪取政權的，不料阿國皇帝，並不讓意國過問一切，郤獨自乘此埋頭整頓內政，充實國防，結果這黑種國家反而成爲意大利的殷憂了。</p>
<p>意阿事伴的背景大槪是　　樣，而引起這次糾紛的導火綫則是去年十二月五日意屬索謀里蘭土兵和阿比西尼亞軍隊在華爾華爾（Wala-Wal）的衝突。當衝突之前，英阿勘界委員會曾在其地開會，據勘界委員報告，華爾華爾的意軍適在阿國境內，因此這種行勁是含有挑撥性的。</p>
<p>一九三五年一月，意國殖民部的預算驟然的增加起來，墨索里尼自兼殖民部長而任命那主張以戰爭征服阿比西尼亞的波諾將軍（Gen　de　Bons）爲「意屬東菲」的總督，（所謂意屬東非者，是指以里特利亞和索謀里蘭的聯結，而中間郤隔着阿比西尼亞！）意國報紙說明這次任命的目標是在一次决算意阿間所有的問題。自一九三四年的年底起，意國大軍和大批軍用品就不斷的從蘇彝士運河運到東菲去。</p>
<p>自華爾華爾事件發生後，阿比西尼亞郎根據盟約第十一條正式向國聯申訴。英國政府則力迫阿此西尼亞與意國直接談判。那談判完全以一九二八年條約的精神爲根據。意國表示華爾華爾以外的問題不當在談判之列，阿國人應向意國旗行禮致敬並賠償道歉。阿政府則要求將意阿間所有的爭執付諸仲裁，並表示願接受行政院的調處。</p>
<p>情勢一天天的惡劣起來，阿比西尼亞又援引盟約第十第十五兩條要求國聯嬄速阻止戰禍。四月間英法代表會晤墨索里尼於斯特萊柴，那英國代表原是帶了一個「阿比西尼亞通」去的，可是臨時郤沒有勇氣跟黑衣首相談及這個問題。在四月裏，國聯行政院特別會議中，阿國的申訴並不曾討論。五月下旬行政院舉行例會，繼决定由二意人二阿人組織仲裁委員會去研究華爾華爾事件的責任問題。意阿問題在行政院中遷延着沒有絲毫的辦法，雖然那華爾華爾事件已很明白只是一種藉口，而意國官方的報紙且公然表示意大利的目標，是在征服整個的阿此西尼亞了。</p>
<p>截至七月中旬止，意軍開入東菲的已達二十萬人了，阿國不斷地向行政院提出申訴，並要求行政院派遣中立人員至當地査察，都遭据絕。那四人仲裁委員會因談判破裂擱了淺，遂使七月底的行政院會議陷於無可如何的困難之中·在會議之前，英國報紙和國會都滔滔談論英政府將儼然不惜與意國破裂，以擁護行政院的措置。可是行政院一開會，艾登却又軟下來，僅通過了比五月例會所决議還軟弱的方案，叫仲裁委員會根據意大利的意志去繼續進行仲裁程序。（就是不涉到意軍在華爾華爾是否侵入阿境的問題。）决定召集英法意三國會議，根據一九零六年的協定，以討論阿比西尼亞的將來：又决定把全問題遷延到九月四日的行政院例會。</p>
<p>在八月間的巴黎會議中，英法代表向意大利提議把阿比西尼亞的東部頒土割讓給牠，同時再加上許多經濟的移民的利益，可是墨索里尼仍不滿足，他不要這些荒瘠的山地，他要的是整個肥沃的阿比西尼亞，這樣，三國會議便又宣吿瓦解了。</p>
<p>三國會議失敗後，英相包爾溫即匆匆從休假地趕回，召集內閣緊急會議，一時形勢緊張，麥唐納說爲一九一四年以來所僅有。當旣决議於必要時向國聯行政院提議制裁辦法，另一方面加速擴張空軍，集中地中海艦隊。英國的恐怖是當然的。因爲牠統有直布羅陀蘇彝士運河和紅海，牠的海軍稱霸地中海，牠又是國聯永久最有力的會員國，在東菲跟意大利更有密切的利害關係。牠旣表示了制裁的傾向，只希望法國能够同意牠的主張，可是八月二十八日法閣緊急閣議的結果，郤表示反對制裁。</p>
<h2>Page 28</h2>
<h2>Page 29</h2>
<p>在九月四日的行政院會議中，意阿問題已是到了最後的關頭。仲裁委員會提出模糊的裁定書，說是雙方各不負責，便悄悄地結束了牠的工作。意大利在會中嚴詞斥責阿比西尼亞是野蠻之國，無權加入國聯，而阿代表則侃侃援引國聯盟約十條和十五條，催促國聯迅速行動以弭戰禍。意代表一經阿代表發言就憤然離席，表示不屑和阿比西尼亞「分庭抗禮，」這樣便使行政院左右爲難，最後乃决停止討論，另以英，法，波蘭，西班牙，土耳其五國代表組織特別委員會，處理意阿爭議。特委會經半月的努力，草成了建議書，提出建議四項：（一）阿國公共治安由國際警察憲兵維持，（二）阿國政府應允許外國政府合作經濟開發，（三）改革財政，（四）改革司法敎育衛生，對於以上四項建議，由國聯行政院各派首席顧問一人，分別負責管轄。這建議送交意阿二國政府後，阿國當旣表示接受，而墨索里尼則仍態度强硬，反對國聯監治，蓋必欲夷滅阿比西尼亞而後已。</p>
<p>特委會的調解旣又失敗，行政院乃根據盟約第十五條指派委員會，再行磋商及公斷全部的問題，該委員會由英法蘇聯阿根廷西班牙澳洲土耳其羅馬尼亞波蘭萄葡牙丹麥厄瓜多智利十三國代表組成，一成立便日在延宕之中，而東菲戰雲則日益緊急，九月二十九日意內閣會議後發表公報，表示對阿决加緊軍事行動，同日阿皇也電吿國聯已頒發總動員令，十月三日泛繁黨下總動員令侵入阿境，這纔十三國委員會着了忙，匆匆召集會議表示無能爲力，只有靜待行政院就目前局勢加以審議。行政院乃又指定英，法，西班牙，羅馬尼亞，萄葡牙，智利六國代表，組成六人委員會，就爭議國的報告，研究局勢，而决定誰爲侵略國，俟侵略國判定後，國聯旣將考慮制裁。</p>
<p>同時英國表明態度，謂决擁護國聯施行制裁，如國聯竟無效力，英國民眾勢必不再注意國聯，一面派艾登至巴黎與賴伐爾會商施行制裁辦法，但法國之意，則還想和意國進行談判，因此制裁方式仍舊不能妥協。</p>
<p>國聯六人委員會最近判定意國爲侵略國，行政院將進而考慮制裁的步驟，然而泛繫大軍郤已浩浩蕩蕩地殺入阿杜華城了。</p>

<h3 id="c220">江河水災之觀感 <a href="#c220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>— 賡雅</p>
<p>長江黃河，利害不同；故俗稱長江爲中國掙家子，黃河爲中國敗家子。顧自淸咸豐五年，迄今十年間，黃河一決銅瓦廂，再決鄭州，三決濮陽，前年四決冀魯南北兩堤，每次决口，均泛濫數十縣。乃斑斑舊創未復，今秋復有魯酏城董莊之大決口，自七月十日起，黃水奪大溜十分之八，南下滿灌魯西蘇北達二十餘縣。目前口門未堵，出路不暢，滔滔濁流，尙正如追風絕塵之股羈馬，到處任性踐蹈生靈，爲禍不知將伊胡底！長江遠在淸乾隆年曾患大水，入民國後則有十五年二十年及今年之三次大泛濫，尤以今次災區最廣，災情最慘。當江河同時肇禍，各省相繼成災，記者特由滬出發，視察兩流重災區域，目覩耳聞，都已大部在本報發表。此行爲時凡四十餘日，重災省縣區多已到達，得一比較深刻之共同印象，旣所謂中國敗家子之黃河，歷代設官防治，歲糜鉅資，固未移化其野性而令循規蹈矩；即所　掙家子之長江，今亦似乎染有黃水惡　，匪特會屢有蕩檢踰閑之舉，恐從此更養成日益放肆之根·然而夷考其實，敢以堅决態度曰：此非兩流先天水性之絕對難治，實爲後天人事治水之未致其力也。</p>
<p>請先言今年江河水災成因：（一）雨量過多。長江流域，六七月之交，連日大雨，致其上游幹流及主要支流襄河湘水三路同時暴漲，匯於鄂境；下游贛皖等省亦大雨連綿，去路宣洩困難，水勢汹湧，較二十年尤甚。二十年水位在四十七呎八吋時，漢口鐵路堤破即全市進水，今年漢市水位竟升至五十二呎餘；他如宜昌沙市監利一帶水位，亦均較二十年高出一呎多。黃河流域，整個七月上旬，幾乎無日不雨，籠門以上主流，受雨量影響尙小，惟支流如陝之渭瀁，豫之伊洛同時暴漲，致下游流量驟達一萬三千五百秒立方公尺·雨量最多處爲秦嶺山脈，嶺北雨水歸渭河，嶺南雨水流漢江（旣襄河），爲患均特別慘重。</p>
<p>（二）河底淤高·長江自出蜀峽下荊門，挾其多量泥土，奔騰而下，凡遇寬淺流緩之處，旣沈澱成洲嶼，如漢口以下八大沙洲（崇文洲，太子磯，姚家洲，馬當洲，張家洲，江家洲，戴家洲，蘿　洲，等是）及許多普通沙灘，無不星落棋布，壅塞水流。每日由江口流入海中者，尙約有一百二十五萬噸之多。崇明島當明末淸初，係孤立海中，今已漸與陸地淤連。江蘇串塲河之范公堤，宋范文正公築，名曰「捍海塘」，原以防禦海潮襲擊，嗣因每六十年平地向海外約伸長一哩，范公堤竟遠距海濱百三四十里以外。凡此皆足證江水含泥量不在少數，並隨地有沉澱以增高河底之可能也。至黃河水所含泥沙量，尤多至百分之四十。蓋黃河兩岸，大都爲黃土層構成，晴天滿佈灰塵，雨時旣成泥漿而入河，初夾泥沙以行，迨自出孟津，兩岸地勢平坦，水流漸緩，泥沙遂漸沉澱下游河床，年有增高。現近海河床，已較數十年前之大淸河底增高三十餘尺。去歲春泛，上游冲刷較多，沿途淤積，河床亦約高一公尺以上。洪流所經之處，水位自無形抬高，故今年大水，水位超過往歲半公尺至一公尺之間。</p>
<p>（三）堤防及其他。江河水位增髙，流量加大，預將堤防增高培原，或能收化險爲夷，防患朱然之效。倘平時併此而亦不能，臨時又不奮勇搶險，潰決更復遷延不堵，斯泛濫無已時，此常理也。長江天然蓄水湖及其正支流灘地，相率被各地官民圍墾，洩水之路旣已日阻，容水之地茲復日蹙；外加堤防之不高固，如安徽「六百丈」幹堤，高度未修至二十年最髙水位（尙差一公尺），遂致江水漫入；湖北襄河「三四弓」及「雙河垸」諸潰口，係水利負責人築堤時，用包工制以圖省費悞事等等，諸病同時暴作，遂釀數省鉅災。但有一事足稱述者，漢口水位，漲至五十二呎，比市區髙出七呎餘，較二十年大水水位（四十六呎旣潰張公堤，四十七呎八吋再潰鐵路堤而全市進水），殆亦有過而無不及，然能獨倖免於大災者，以當地軍民一致努力搶險故也。當水頭高漲，張公堤相繼塌陷，險狀百出，漢市八十餘萬人口，惶惶然如大禍將臨時，江漢水利工程局長楊思　氏，忽一度潛身避責：又二十年大水災時，因前局長某氏，將水利經費挪作他用，致臨時無以添工購料，遂淪漢市於澤國。水利當局負責與否，其影響鉅大如此·黃河上流，來自朔漠，扶泥帶沙，多迤邐山谷間，自無潰決之患。至豫孟津出山，始有堤防，至武陟陡落平原，一瀉千里，泥沙隨處沉澱，依界堤防之處尤多·豫省堤防，蘭封以東，尙安穩可守，西及冀境，則迭出巨險。魯省河身較豫冀漸狹，水流至此逐漸抬高，自民元迄今，蘭對董莊間共決口十四次。本年最緊念之險工，經黃河水利委員會認定自朱口至董莊長約二十里之一段，特先撥欵十萬元，交由山東河務局長張連甲負責，將該段大堤加高至二十二年之洪水位，其他豫冀堤工，亦有同樣之修理，且已完成，而朱口董莊間獨未竣工，大水驟至，乃出大險，堤外民埝先漫，大堤繼遭潰決。人民鑒於黃河災變，與長江不同，一經泛濫，旣漫無限制，乃一致哀請搶護，張氏以水大溜急，工料兩缺爲辭，不幸遂鑄成大錯。古云，人同此心，心同此理。在口門但見濁浪排空，但聞水聲呼號，爲有不抱一捨身願入黃河中，抗濤速使河成功」之同，威者！水利工程之興廢，負責者之盡朋與否，關係極重大。今黃河決口負責人張氏，已蒙中央電令戴罪立功，張氏其速資惕自勵，以從事於口門之善後乎？</p>
<p>、此次江河水災，災區徧達鄂湘贛皖魯蘇豫冀等省，災情大部均極慘重。據各方調査報告，成災縣數；鄂有五十一　縣市，湘三十七縣（內重災十五縣），贛四十八縣（內重災十三縣），皖十三縣，豫六下縣，魯蘇各十數縣，冀數縣。被災面積、鄂四，四八六，九九〇方公里，淹田七〇，二三七，一五五公畝；湘潰埝田畝數三，八九六，一四六畝，被漬水田數一，六六〇，八五八畝；贛重災區三十餘縣，內有五縣報告共淹田地三十二萬三千餘畝，皖被淹田地四十一萬餘畝，豫災區九三八，一六〇方里，淹地四三七，三八七畝：魯災區六〇〇，〇〇〇方里淹地八，一五四，〇三一畝；災民人數鄂七百十五萬人；湘四百十萬人；皖三十餘萬人；贛三百五十萬人；豫三百七十餘萬人；魯五百萬人。財產損失數，僅三省有報吿，計鄂爲一萬三千萬元，豫爲六千九百餘萬元，皖六百餘萬元·人口淹斃數，僅豫省有報吿，計五千二百七十三人。餘均未詳，尤其蘇省災區正在擴大中，各項損失數字，尙無調資報告，故皆缺而未備。惟據中央振務委員會委員長許世英氏査勘估計鄂湘贛皖四省水災損失共計面積當達十萬平方公里，淹斃人口亦在十萬人以上，直接間接公私財產損失，恐不下五萬萬元云。餘如豫冀魯蘇陝晋直接間接受黃水災害各省，均無較整之數字統計，但以較二十二年豫冀黃河決堤大水，廣一萬二千七百九十二萬公里之災區，三百餘萬人之災民（僅此一項，尙不及今次山東一省災民人數），財物漂沒達二萬萬元之損失，事實上必超過數倍之多。合計今次江河水災財物損失，其數字之鉅大，誠如國府振委會顧問貝克氏所謂「如此兩三次之水災損失，定可抵償中國全部國債。」良非過言。然則此次空前巨災，有傷國家元氣，有損國民經濟，尙可以道里計哉？</p>
<p>今橫亘於吾人眼前最急需最緊要之善後問題，厥爲黃河堵口及災民救濟工作之努力實施。黃河堵口，爲蘇魯人民計，爲國民經濟計，爲水政系統計，在在均爲刻不容緩之必辦事。蓋決口一日不堵合，則洪流一日不退落，今年麥種已絕望，明年春耕亦渺茫；而蘇北災區將擴至若何程度，更不忍設想。數百萬災黎，日呻吟於生死兩難之境，倘丁壯不甘坐困，如前倡言就食南京，甚或鋌而走險，流爲盜匪，其爲害國家社會，恐將遠浮於水災之上。長江流域之水災，雖以地勢關係，自行减退；但一千四百萬之災民，焦頭爛額，露宿餐風，固依然如舊也。夫救災之難，不在於災象初成之日，而在災禍綿延之後；災民處境最困之時，不在鬧災熱烈之始，而在災聲寂滅之日。轉瞬秋去冬來，天寒夜長，社會救災之聲旣日漸沉寂，地方慈警捐欵亦悉索殆盡。從而更淡然下去，災民勢必罹於餓鬼地獄，或爲路旁凍骨，是豈籌振之初意耶？九六老人馬相伯先生曰：「災黎之不救，旣整個國家之損失；今日之救人，亦旣他日之自救。』國人及籌振機關，其三復斯言！</p>
<p>水之爲患，代有所聞，每多一次之災患，在防災策劃上，當多一改善之認識。若時過境遷，便爾澹忘；或雖議有切實治水辦法，而遷延不行：則天變無時，水災恐將與年俱增矣。關於洽水根本辦法，中外水利專家，多已論列及之；惟欲求其澈底能收一勞永逸之功效，按諸江河天時地理水性關係，對症下藥亟應傾全力以赴之之鵠的有四：一曰堤防，長江大水，如襄河堤防高固，則天門漢川等九縣，絕不至因一二决口而全部陸沉。漢口事先若不照二十年水位增高堤防，臨時復不拼命搶險，則二十年全市進水之慘劇，必毫不留情而重演於今秋。黃河决口，流禍無窮，旣正坐堤防不固，搶護不力之弊，事實昭昭，可勿待辭費矣。二曰淸源，黃河水患，甚於長江，但長江水位，近亦年見增高，此無他，水含泥沙作祟故也。欲滅輕泥沙量，澄淸水源，宜於下游沿岸植樹造林，兼種苜蓿，旣上游流域各省，亦須廣種樹木，使保護士壤，不致爲雨水冲刷而下。急驟短促之雨量，林木草葉，均能直接緩和其勢，而减少溝河急劇奔騰之害。要之，植林能否控制大自然之雨量，固不可必：惟藉以减少淤墊河底之泥沙，蓋可操之左券也。三曰分闢支流，水量大增，河身不容，分流以殺水勢，固亦應急之辦法。惟劃一河而爲數</p>
<h2>Page 30</h2>
<p>流，在堤防上地面上旣不經濟，在事實上恐亦利少書多，得不償失。宋蘇輙謂：『河性急則通流，緩則淤澱，旣無東西皆念之勢，安有兩河幷行之理。』明潘季馴亦謂：『水分則勢緩，勢緩則沙停·水合則勢猛，勢猛則沙刷·』兩氏見理極眞，可爲佐證·但能擇地建閘，或築滾水壩，俟水位高至某種稈度，可啟閘放水，以分流量·放水設法引導，殆有利無害也·四曰節制流量，如廢田還江，廢田還湖，淸除沙灘，凡足以增加匯納洪水容量者均屬之·最要者莫如於主支流之上游建築水庫，例如襄河爲長江最大支流，在陝境環山疊嶂中，可修大規模蓄水池·渭河爲黃河最大支流，平時流量，不足三十秒立方公尺，潼關黃河流量爲一百五十秒立方公尺，惟至大水時期，情勢驟變，黃河祗一千立方公尺，渭河竟漲至一萬立方公尺，謂爲黃災主因，良非無據·倘能於上游寶鷄谷中亦建一大水庫，使洪水有迴漩停瀦之地，當時旣可攔阻洪水，以减下游水患，以後亦可緩緩放出，藉資灌溉航運之用，此外，沿河水文記載，水位報吿，地形測量，以及水利機關之完善組織，水利負責人員之公正遴選，幷嚴明賞罰，以獎懲功過等等，欲求整個水利功能之完美表現，凡上述諸事端，皆不可或忽焉·</p>
<p>要之，江河水患，能治理收效與否，國家賦稅，民族生命，國民經濟，在在均與有密綿之聯繁，羣策羣力以赴之，此其時矣。</p>

<p>— 不忍</p>
<p>治水之基本條件凡三，一爲巨額之經費，二爲專門之人才，三爲全盤籌劃與通力合作；欲求治水收永久之效果此三者缺一不可·吾國自經三四九次政治會議議决將各水利機關統一歸全國經濟委員會主管後，水利行政始吿統一。此確是治水之好現象，但終以經費與人才兩吿缺乏，致治本辦法，無從實施，爲可憾耳。世之言治水者，羣推美國爲先進，最近鄂主席張羣對本報記者頌華談話，亦以『最緊要者，莫若仿美國密士失比河之治水辦法」爲言。美國之治水工程誠足爲我國之借鏡也。</p>
<p>美國現以數十萬萬元之經費，數百萬之工人，在專門人才之指導下，全盤統籌之計劃，進行其偉大之水利工程，直接防止泛濫，保護財產，間接發展水電，使人民得到廉價之熱光力，且從而救濟失業。其最近工程之可記述者，有三事焉。</p>
<p>（一）波爾特巨壩告成</p>
<p>波爾特巨壩建築計劃，係一九二八年十二月下旬國會所通過，已於上月卅日行落成典禮。其地在阿利索那州與尼伐達州之間。此壩築成後，使兩州邊境之柯洛拉杜河河水面積增多五百八十二呎。壩高七百五十呎，爲全世界之最高者，蓄水三千零五十萬立方呎。壩頂長一千一百八十呎，頂寬四十五呎，底寬六百五十呎，共用水泥四百四十萬立方碼，約需水擬五百五十萬桶。此壩蓄柯洛拉杜河之餘水，供給灌溉農田之需，並調節河流，以便利航行，而保護南加里福尼亞州殷譬利爾流域之田地，使免遭汎濫缺水及淤積之害。壩後造成一大湖，長約一百十五哩，面積約十四萬五千英畝。此誠世界之最大蓄水池也。巨壩之水泥工程，已於今春全部告成，惟電廠建築及水電機裝置尙未完工。發電機馬力，最低爲一百八十三萬五千匹。將來電力出售之所得，可償還政府所墊付一萬六千五百萬元之鉅欵而有餘，。</p>
<p>（二）奧西亞州十四大壩開工</p>
<p>奧西亞州現以三千四百五十萬元之經費進行密斯金更河蓄水計劃。此計劃所包括之最大工程爲建築十四大壩。此十四大壩築成後，可以阻止常期的河水汎濫與泥水淤積。工作現已開始進行，工人約三千名，大抵從失業階級雇來，用具爲最新式之巨大平土機，及爬蟲式機車。十四大壩所在地爲離馬西隆城不出五十哩一帶地方，俱在密斯金更河之支河流域，全區面積約五百方哩。受利地帶，爲全州最富庶之區域。類皆士地肥沃，人口稠密，商業與盛。十四大壩中，最長者爲離馬西隆城十哩之巴里華地方一壩，計長六千三百呎，高八十呎。第二爲在巴里華西首之皮克地方之一壩，計長五千八百呎。此十四大壩建築計劃，發動於二十一年前大水災過後，當時經費缺乏未克實行。現因救濟失業，乃促成其事。依照目前計劃，在此三千四百五十萬元經費中，二千二百五十萬元，係由美國公共工程局撥發，六百萬元取於地方捐稅，二百萬元由州政府津貼，六百萬元將由公路部提案籌劃，設再感不足，當由聯邦政府於建築小壩項下支付之。全部工程，歸美國陸軍工程師管理，由陸軍少校善尼斯維爾氏主持其事。</p>
<p>（三）密士失比河模型定期試騐</p>
<p>用水泥贊成之密士失比河巨大模型，已在工程師及水利專家之指導下建造完成，將定期在美國水工試騐所試騐一九二七年之大水。模型長一千零六十呎，最寬處一百六十八呎，面積十一萬二千方呎，代表十六萬方哩之眞面積，爲全世界水道模型之最大者。如是巨大之模型，所代表皆僅密土失比河六百零一哩之一段及墨西哥灣之一部分；如欲代表全河，則模型長度非伸至一哩以外不可。一九二七年大水泛濫時，密士失比河動水量爲每秒鐘一百七十六萬立方呎：模模型試騐此大水時之動水最，將爲每秒鐘一·八二立方呎·當八年前大水災後·美國國會旣通過以巨大之經費辦理防水工程，由陸軍工程師從事勘察，進行工作。此新造之密士失比河模型，旣爲供彼等試騐之最重要工具。從此以後，彼等不僅以精密之計算爲依據，且將藉此模型爲實際之試騐。樓型之堤岸，較實際築就之堤岸更高；待試騐之大水汎濫，將比歷來發生者更烈。不僅此也，旣有模型，河流之全部局勢易於觀察，勝於局部觀察，自不待言。按美國水工試騐所創辦於一九三〇年。其主要事務爲建造各種與水利問題有關之模型以供試騐。創辦時工作人員僅十餘名，現達三百六十五名，其中一百十三名爲技術人員及高等職員。此次密土失比河模型之造成，實爲該所最大之成績。</p>

<p>— 沈百先</p>
<p>（二十四年雙十節）</p>
<p>最近一年來之江蘇省建設工程，仍列水利爲首要，公路交通次之。以言水利：導淮工程關係蘇省水利全局，倡議歷數十年之久，今已見諸實施，此至堪欣慰者也。疏浚沂沭尾閭工程，爲導淮之一部，其需要亦最迫切，業已問時舉辦。裏運河隄，爲下河七邑生命財產之保障，坐灣迎溜之處，應改埽爲石，以資永固·裏下河通海各港，爲西水歸海及海潮內灌之孔道，應建築潮水閘，以資　禦。倡議均已多年，現亦見諸實施·江南水利，素甲全國，近以河道涵閘，年久失修，已苦利病參半·現經利用工賑，大舉與修·江南海塘歲修，久付缺如，致一遇風潮，塘身即多所殘破·現於大舉興修之後，恢復歲修制度，均爲進步可喜之現象。此其尤著者也。綜計最近一年間，全省所辦水利工程，出土約達五千四百萬公方，工作人數超過五十萬人，全省三千三百餘萬人，平均約每六十人中，有服工者一人，差可稱爲努力矣。以言公路：使各縣縣治所在，均有縣道可與省道銜接。並與隣省重　城鎭聯絡·最近一年間，繼續完成公路三百餘公里，完成土路通車二百餘公里，督造各縣縣道九十餘公里。茲將最近一年內所辦水利公路工程，擇要列舉如左，以資考鏡。</p>
<p>（一）水利</p>
<p>一，開闢導淮入海初步工程導淮入海之重要，早爲國人所共知。其計劃以排洪爲主·次及航運灌溉之利。排洪以分歸江海爲原則。入海路綫，取道廢黃河，曾由導淮委員會决定公怖。原計畫需欵三千四百餘萬元，爲數太鉅，不易籌措，乃有分期實施之規劃。其初步工程，共需出土約七千萬公方，需欵一千六百萬元，仍以工大費鉅，一時未能興辦。本省政府與地方人士，均以此項工程，有利害切身關係，興辦不容再緩。經省政府與導淮會商定，由蘇省勉籌工欵，按照初步工程計畫，徵工辦理。全部預算，除建閘外，初估約需七百萬元。由淮陰淮安泗陽涎水鹽城阜寗江都髙郵寶應泰縣東台興化等十二縣，每年共徵民夫十六萬人，利用農隙，從事開挖。分兩年完成。自二十三年十月一日，組織成立導淮入海工程處於淮陰，省政府委許心武爲處長陳和甫爲副處長。十一月一日，巾陳主席率同在工人員，舉行開工典禮於淮陰之楊莊，積極進行。此項大工，前無師承，各縣情形不同，徵工尤多窒碍，開工之初，實到工夫寥寥無幾，又値嚴冬春節，遂以天時人事之牽率，進行濡滯，工作效率與成績，俱未能顯著。嗣經省政府召集導淮各縣縣長暨地方人士在省開徵工會議，决定推進方案，以分別徵工徵金及工金並徵爲原則。於二十四年二月下旬，大舉興工。民夫齊集，畚錘如雲，工程邁進，日有起色。至五月底止，時屆農忙，暫行停工，共計實到工夫十三萬人，挑土一千八百餘萬公方。最近農忙已過，故復於九月十五日，召集各縣縣長來省會議，籌商進行。定十月一日，繼續開工。今後設施便捷，進度自增，預計在明年農忙前，可完成放水。</p>
<p>二，疏浚沂沭尾閭工程淮北重要河道，有沂沭泗運。沭漲則犯沂，沂漲亦犯沭，沂沭並漲，則成相持之局。下游宣洩不及，復灌泗運，水流愈亂，受害愈烈。整理工程，據導淮委員會估計，非二千萬元以上不辦。本省斟酌財力，權衡輕重，以治河先從下游着手爲原則，决定先治尾閭，暢其宣洩。並以徵工辦理，以期省費速成。除北六塘河已於二十二年度浚治完成外，二十三年度着手疏浚者：（一）蕭沭河，（二）總六塘河淺段，（三）柴米河下游，（四）燒香河。共需出土約三百萬公方，需工欵約二十萬元。除由省府撥助十八萬元外，錄由地方自籌，並由賑務鹽務等機關協助。此項工程，省府交由導淮入海工程處兼辦，就近指揮宿　沭陽東海灌雲四縣，極積進行。自二十三年十月開始籌辦，至二十四年五月底先後完成。計徵集工夫三萬餘人，江鉅費艱，幸　各方熱心協助，官民努力合作，故大工能如期吿竣，至足感欣。二十四年度尚擬擇其餘急要水道舉辦，以期永澹淮北沈災。</p>
<p>三，興建王竹港潮水閘工程裏下河通海各港，爲淮運之尾閭，常有滷潮倒灌之患；建築潮水閘以格蓄淡禦滷，殊屬切要。東台之何垜港鬥龍港，先由全國經濟委員會撥欵各建潮水閘一座，王竹兩港建閘，雖倡議已久，而絀於經費，迄未實現。二十三年春，本省因感無可埠緩，决意舉辦，乃於三月十日，組織成立工程處於東台。以兪漱芳爲主任，先往工地探騐地質。經精密設計，全部經費預算，共需一十五萬四千元，招商承包，於五月中旬，工程開始。中間歷經困阻，如匪警瀕傳，危險堪虞；土質堅硬，施工不易：亢旱水洩，運輸爲艱。工程一再延緩，兩閘始得於二十四年三同時完竣。此項工程完成後，裏下河各縣一千數百萬畝之農田，蓄淡禦滷，益臻完備矣。</p>
<p>四，江北運河改埽爲石工程運河險要處所，向有柴土築做之臨時護岸工程，謂之掃工。柴質易朽，年需加廂，三年更需拆廂，殊爲藥費。原有全部埽工，積長約九千三百公尺，除擋軍樓廟巷口七公殿三處，已於民國二十二年冬，由上海華洋義賑會撥欵十二萬元，改建石工外，尙餘全長八千四百八十五公尺，由江北運河工程局擇其地勢衝要者改爲塊石護岸，以垂久遠。由省府籌欵二十四萬元，於二十四年四月實行開工，至七月底止，因水漲暫行停工。未完工程，秋後當獵續興辦。</p>
<p>五，旱災工賑浚河工程民國二十三年，蘇省亢早成災，大江南北，災區甚廣。就中以六合溧陽等十二縣災情爲尤重。省府籌撥四百萬元，辦理省縣工程，以資救濟。此項工程，以浚河修隄爲主。修築閘涵爲輔。屬於省辦者，爲疏浚赤山湖及秦淮河流域，整理鎭武運河及丹陽練湖，疏浚宜溧運河及丹金溧漕河。分設工賑處於句容丹陽溧陽，委馮旦陳志定邱毓珩爲各該處主任。二十三年十月，組織測量隊，實施測量。並以關係各縣縣長兼各工賑處副主任，襄助辦理招募夫工事宜。十二月先後開工。至二十四年五月土方工程陸續完成。總計出土方約七百萬公方，其未及舉辦之練湖整理，暨修建滿閘等工，今秋仍當繼續興辦。縣辦工賑，就早災較重之溧陽宜興江浦六合等三十五縣，分別輕重，補助工欵浚河開塘。計開河長七百餘公里土方約七百五十萬公方，到工民夫省縣兩共約二十萬人，此外本省自二十一年度起倡辦各縣徵工浚河，迄今三載，成績與年俱增；二十三年度江南北各縣於從事導淮及工賑等工程之餘，徵浚成績，仍頗可觀·計出土一千九百餘萬公方，到工人數亦不下二十萬人，</p>
<p>六，江南海塘工程江南海塘，長亘五百餘里，爲沿海十餘縣之屛障。實太常松四縣海塘，地當江海之衝，形勢尤見險峻。故向建石塘，以保安全。近年以來，迄以歲修欵絀，工程日見　敗。民國二十年秋，遭遇異常風潮，損毀益鉅。雖曾興辦善後正工，終爲經費所限，僅能完成其急要部份，聊資粗安而已。二十二年秋，又遭兩次風潮，新舊工均有毀損。省府復於二十三年勉籌工欵五十二萬元，交由建設廳將急要部份，先行興修。此項工程，於五月下句開工，値亢旱水淺，氣候炎熱，運輸施工，均感困難。經晝夜趕修，多方加工，所有險要工段，均於秋汛大潮前趕辦完成。總計正工全長四千八百公尺有餘，並以餘欵增修次險工段一千七百餘公尺，續於十月下旬，全部吿竣。工程完竣，又訂定海塘修護辦法，每年歲修經費，豫算列十萬元，從事修護，以保久遠。本年歲修工程，由江南水利工程處負責籌辦，仍係就急要中擇尤估修。如塊石木椿之凌亂缺圯者，整理修補，以免擴大。塊石蔴袋稀樁蔴袋各工，酌量改建椿石工，藉臻穩固。土塘外灘地坍削，逼近塘身者，酌量添建樁石及攔水壩，以資捍禦。其中段主不可收拾者，四改建新工。此項工程，已於二十四年八月開工趕做。做。</p>
<p>七，建築鎭江北固山氣象台蘇省於二十年大水後，復繼以二十二年大旱，故早將水利工程，列爲首要建設。惟於改訂計書驚定方案之際，每感水文資料，不甚充足。舉辦測候事業，遂爲當務之急，於是有省會測候所之設立。並由所長顧世揖籌書建築鎮江北固山氣象台，用樹基礎，該台經始於二十三年國慶日，至二十四年三月落成。計造價約一萬元，台髙四層，遙望如天柱，如碉堡，壁立半空，氣象雄偉。台成之後，向英德各國購辦之重要儀器，亦先後運到，裝置完成。本省氣象研究，從此開紀元焉。</p>
<p>（二）公路</p>
<p>一，完成鎭澄路工程鎭澄路自鎭江經丹陽武進以達江陰，計長一百十五公里半。其橋梁涵洞土基完成後，績行鯛築三公尺，寬碎石路面。於二十三年十二月全部完成，通行汽車</p>
<p>二，完成錫滬路工程錫　路自無錫經常熟太倉嘉定至上海，本省境內計長一百二十九公里。橋梁一百四十九座，涵洞六十二道，水管三百八十四道，於本年三月以前陸續完成。又全路鋪築　石基石砂路面。於本年一月開工，至七月完成通車。</p>
<p>三，完成蘇常路工程蘇常路係自蘇州至常熟，計長三十九公里。蘇州境內橋梁二十五座，涵洞上一道，水管六十道，均於本年二月以前陸續築成。常熟境内曾於二十一年築成軍用橋梁二十座，此次改建正式橋梁。又添建滿洞七道，於本年三月以前陸續完成。全路鋪築三公尺寬碎石路面，至本年七月完成通車。</p>
<p>四，完成蘇崑路蘇崑路崑滬一段，由市政府修築，蘇崑一段，由本省修　，全段計長約四十五公里。鋪築三公尺寬煤屑路面。建築橋梁六十一座，　洞二百七十四道，於本年七月全部完成。</p>
<p>五，完成揚浦路土路通車揚浦路自江都經儀徵六合浦鎭以至浦口，長約九十五公里半。除全路土基由縣微築完成，及合浦段橋涵於二十三年度由六合縣政府築成，計築六揚段橋梁十一座，涵洞三百八十九道，均於二十三年十月完成。又運河建築活動橋一座，滁河建築船渡一處，汽車已由揚州通至浦鎭。</p>
<p>六，完成溧武路土路通車溧武路自溧水經天王寺句容金壇，以至武進，長計九十五公里。土基由沿綫各縣分別徵工，或雇工興築，全路共建橋梁三十三座，滿洞四百七十七道，並改建橋梁一座，又因溧天一段爲京杭京建兩路之聯絡綫，計長二十公里，同時鋪築碎石路面。均於二十三年十二月完成。通行汽車。</p>
<p>七，督造各縣縣道鎮溧路鎮江段長十三公里半，經督飭鎭丹金溧長途汽車公司鋪築三公尺寬碎磚路面，於上年十一月完成。武宜路自武進至宜興漕橋，約長三十一公里，經督飭武宜長途汽車公司鋪築碎石路面，於上年十一月完成。松泗路自松已完成。蘇木路自蘇州至木凟，長約十二公里，橋涵土基築成後，復繼續鋪築三公尺寬煤屑碎磚路面，已於本年七月完成。靑泥路約長二十三公里，第一段橋梁早已完成，茲又將第二段橋梁五座築成，路面工程正在進行中。</p>

<p>小朋友！那一天是你的生日？那一天是你哥哥你姊姊的生日？你的爸爸和媽媽的生日又是那一天？你逢到你自己你哥哥你姊姊你爸爸你媽媽的生日，你是怎樣過去的？</p>
<p>十月十日便是我們中華民國國家的生日啊！</p>
<p>中華民國年紀要比你們小朋友大好幾年，他今年已有二十四歲了。在民國前幾年，孫中山先生等覺得那時候淸朝的專制政體不好，就聯合了國內外愛國的志士，揭起了民族革命的旗幟，推翻了淸朝，其間不知犧牲了多少愛國志士，終於在民國前一年的十月十日那一天，推翻專制政體而改爲共和政體，取消大淸帝國而建立中華民國，大家就把這一天定爲國慶紀念，算作中華民國的生日凡是中華民國的國民，大家都該熱情而狂歡地慶祝中華民國的生日！</p>
<p>可是，在另一方面，我要請各位小朋友特別注意，我們中華民國立國以來，外侮日亟，國勢日弱，你們小朋友僅僅唱唱國慶歌談談國慶由來的故事，就算慶祝了中華民國的生日了麽？</p>

<p>— 閻重樓</p>
<p>小弟第生在一個惡劣的環境當中。</p>
<p>小弟弟生下以後，他的父母就都死亡了！小弟第孤獨的生長着。</p>
<p>小弟弟漸漸地長大了，但是他的環境並沒有變好，他的痛苦反而增加了！</p>
<p>小弟弟身邊包圍着許多頑童，他們時常對小弟弟加以欺侮，尤其是有一個叫做癩痢頭的，他時常撕破小弟弟的衣服，搶去小弟弟的糖果，並且想奪小弟弟一切的物產。</p>
<p>小弟弟一點也不敢拒抗，因爲那些頑童力氣都是很大的，有一次他和癩痢頭辯了幾句理，癩痢頭竟然把他打得流出血。</p>
<p>小弟弟知道別人欺侮自己，還是因爲自己的力量太　弱了！於是他發奮鍜鍊自己的身體，他又恐怕給那些頑童知道了，所以他總是在深夜的時候偷着苦鍜。</p>
<p>小弟弟一聲不饗的苦鍊了數年，每逢到了他的生日，他必然要把他的功夫計算一下，看他在一年中有了多少進步。</p>
<p>小弟弟覺得他的力量很充實了，於是跨着大步走到頑童的隊裏，他向頑童聲明以後冉不能受他們的侮辱，頑童們聽見很氣憤，癩痢頭第一個跑過來想再打小弟弟的耳光，不料小弟弟飛起一拳，却把癩痢頭打倒了。</p>
<p>小弟弟打倒了癩痢頭，別的頑童看見小弟弟有這樣大的氣力，都很驚怕！有些向小弟弟賠罪，有些却一溜烟逃走了</p>
<p>小弟弟在這一年中的生日，穿着他再沒有敢撕的新衣，吃着他再沒有人敢搶的糖果，慶祝他最後的成功，最後的勝利。</p>

<p>— 李伯黍</p>
<p>國旗是一個國家的標幟，所以我們愛護我們的國家，同時要愛護我們的國旗。小朋友，這意思懂得嗎？</p>
<p>日本的小朋友，他們是很愛他們的國旗，每天早晨到校的時候，見到校門口在空中飄揚着的太陽旗，大家都匪很恭敬的脫了帽子，向它行一個禮，倘使不照這樣做，他們的小巡察員會立刻干涉呢！</p>
<p>美國的小朋友，他們無論在什麼地方，看到了他們的國旗，會立刻舉起右手，伸着中間的三個指頭，向它行一個童子軍禮，看上去很有精神。</p>
<p>法國的小朋友，他們對於從熱血枯骨裏換來的紅白靑（表示自由平等博愛）三色國旗，格外來得尊敬。</p>
<p>其他像英國，德國的小朋友，對於自己的國旗，都是非常敬重的。因爲他們大家愛　們的國旗，他們就能團結一致，替國家奮門，我們中國的小朋友，能够做得到嗎？想想看！</p>
<h3 id="c231">抹抹眼淚歡呼 <a href="#c231" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e231" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">231</a></h3>
<p>— 陳亮</p>
<p>別再哭得這樣悲傷，別再哭得這樣苦，今天是什麼日子呵？</p>
<p>瞧吧，張開含着淚珠的眼，那日曆上的一頁紅字—「十月十日」，多够鮮艷，是先烈熱血迸裂出來的花朵哪。從一片燦爛中能透視出「愛新覺羅」皇座的崩潰，和全民衆從數千年專制鐵龍解放出，高唱自由之歌的幕序。</p>
<p>先烈頭顱所綴成的節日呵，是多麽的偉大，多麽的壯烈，拚住眼前的一點悲哀吧。抹抹眼淚，歡呼。</p>
<p>這一天，這僅僅一天的歡樂總是屬於我們的，我們不能忘掉先烈偉大的犧牲，我們總不能放棄這條先烈冒禺險殺開的自由大路，和路旁許多用熱血澆培長大的花木。我們爲什麽不歡呼中華的誕生呢？！</p>
<p>都這麽說：「中華誕生了二十四年，年年風風雨雨，人民無日不在苦　中苟延着殘喘，所受的天災不用說，所遭異族的威脅就够刺痛了，本身像什麽？一塊俎上的肉，一個利刃下的瓜……幾十雙兇毒的眼無一刻鬆弛。世界上的火藥氣息又如此其濃厚，無一處不是弱小者的危機……還快樂什麼呢？」</p>
<p>可是，老這樣悲哀消沉，於危機有什麼補救？先烈創造下來的事業非叫我們永久去安適享受。不錯，連年風風雨雨，自由的路呈現了崎嶇，自由的花顯得凋零，但，這都是誰的責任，誰的事？不用再頹傷下去了，振振精神，鼓起中華民族的力量，繼續向世界爭取自由平等。今天我們要歡呼，我們要唱，我們不能忘記中華民國的誕生。</p>

<h3 id="c234">小朋友的心理測騐 <a href="#c234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>— 花鈴</p>
<p>將來做怎樣的一個人？</p>
<p>有了錢將幹什麽事業？</p>
<p>這一回，我曾在我所任敎的二級小朋友中，作了一次極有興趣的測騐。現在趁着本刋出專號的機會，發表一下，不知讀本刊的小朋友讀了，作何威想。</p>
<p>我那二級小朋友，是春四年級和秋五年級。春四年級裏共二十七人，最大的是十五歲，最小的是十歲。秋五年級裏共三十九人，最大的也是十五歲，最小的是十一歲。這二級是混合着測騐的，人數共六十六人，但實受測駝的，是六十二人，因爲有四位小朋友是請着假的。這六十二位小朋友之中，十二和十三歲的，共五十一人。</p>
<p>第一個測駝題是：將來就那一種職業？</p>
<p>測騐的結果，是：敎書的二十八人，革命家二十人，文學家二人，美術家和音樂家五人，做官的二人，做軍官的三二人，科學家二人。</p>
<p>從這一個測騐中，我覺得小朋友們對於生活的認識太薄弱。因爲我們中國，現在太多的是敎書先生，太少的是科學家，而據測騐的結果，適得其反。做官的，在六十二人中，只有二人，這倒是一個好現象。但是同時却沒有一個將來願當工人的或農人的，我覺得這於國家民族前途，是關係極大的。我希望將來編訂敎材時，注意一下。</p>
<p>第二個測騐題是：假使我有一百萬元，將如何支配用途？</p>
<p>測騐的結果，是：存入銀行的二十二人，買田買地和買屋的十三人，舉辦慈善事業的，如振災，開學校，設醫院，辦苦兒院等，都包括在內，共十二人，捐助政府和地方機關的四人，投資商業的四人，修橋補路造廟齋僧的二人，捐給義勇軍者二人，自求享樂者三人。</p>
<p>從這一個測騐中，我又感到了一個很大的失望，爲甚麽我們的小朋友之中，沒一個想到運用他的資金，從事於實業的開發與積極的建設事業上面的呢？在這六十二位小朋友之中，自私自利的，還是佔着這麽大的比率，這豈是一種好現象呢？從這測騐中，見到迷信的，僅佔六十二份之二，這一點，總算是敎育上的一點小成功</p>
<p>今天是國慶日，各校裏都放假，我希望小朋友們，大家都對這二個測駝題，作一個答案，明天請你們的老師，做成測騐的表格，大家研究一下。</p>

<p>— 徐幹</p>
<p>在這個兒童年的雙十節，我想不出用什麽供獻給未來的主人。想了好久，覺得未來的時代，無疑是科學的時代；在科學的時代做主人的弟妹們，最需要的就是懂得科學了，於是我想到了一個名字；科學的童話。這個名字是新鮮的。在外國，有了科學的小說，在中國，有了科學的小品；只有科學的童話似乎還很陌生。</p>
<p>童話，大概可分兩類。一類是深一點的，一類是淺一點的。深一點的含有敎育意味：淺一點的全是神話色彩。外國的童話，是前者佔多數，而且都很好，如魯迅先生譯的「錶」便是最好的例子：後一類，卽使是後一類，他們的至少也比我們的要活潑和有趣　中國的童話，前一類是很少的，有呢也都是標榜忠孝節義的舊敎訓反會害了兒童；後一類是很多的，但是已經不是神話，而是鬼話，老虎話，蛇話了；不但單調，而且可怕，說中國有着可以讓孩子們看的童話，我是不大敢相信的。</p>
<p>爲此，救救孩子的呼聲到如今還不能不繼續喊出；對孩子們的未來有着重大干係的童話是需要革命了！如何革法第一，打倒神話，鬼話，老虎話，蛇話，患孝節義話；第二，創造新的眞正的童話。什麼是新的眞正的童話？第一種，文學的童話；第二種，科學的童話，文學的童話是培養兒童對於美的欣賞；科學的童話是以新知識引起兒童探求眞理的興趣。二者之間，第二種是更需要的</p>
<p>親愛的小朋友們，大家起來，努力保住前途的光明！</p>

<p>— 寄萍</p>
<p>國慶紀念，春秋改編爲「兒童專號」，這是我們預定的計劃，也是全國兒童年實施委員會所規定的辦法。從今而後，逢到盛大的紀念，我們便編印「兒童專號」，就因爲兒童是國家的新生命，將來是有希望的，我們忝爲兒童的指導者，所以研究兒童敎育，編兒童刋物，便格外覺得有意義，有味道。</p>
<p>此番我們刋了一次徵稿啟事，在五天中間，收到的稿伴，竟有五百封以上，其中三之一是兒童作品，三之二是非兒童的作品；成人注意到兒童問題，已經不是容易的，而兒童本身能如此踴躍，尤其覺得難能可貴。我曾費了兩天的功夫，把所有的稿件，都仔細看過，知道投稿人的心理，大概可分爲三種：（一）對國家前途甚爲樂觀，（二）對國事非常不滿，表示消極：（三）理想過高，離事實太遠。</p>
<p>我吿訴你：國際風雲如此緊張，國內問題如此複雜：你們只顧目前，不知後患的危急，未免疏於考慮。而眼光短淺的人，一味迷信外人勢力，動輙不滿現狀，雖也不能怪你，但事情不是這樣　單，國事總得逐漸改進，一時也不易奏效。至於理想過高的人，與其對人求全責備，毋寗自己反省。總之中國這幾年來，內有災難，外有外侮，在非常艱難的時期中，尚能小有進步，要是繼續苦幹下去，的確還有希望的。我個人對今天雙十節的感想，如此而已。</p>

<p>— 熊誠</p>
<p>秋風送爽，暖陽高照的當兒，中華民國二十四年的國慶日，又悄悄地降臨了。</p>
<p>想當年，總理以畢生精力，從事革命，經十一次的失敗歷盡一切的艱難困苦，終於創造了中華民國！</p>
<p>「望子成龍」，我們的國父是跟我們一樣的熱望着，希望取消不平等條約，打倒帝國主義，使中國能夠日漸繁榮，强壯。孫總理他非但盡了自己的任務，並且還為後人作想，制定了三民主義，建國方略等。在他是盡了一切的力量。照理，他該「死而瞑目」了。</p>
<p>可是，現在的中國究竟在怎樣的生長着呢？</p>
<p>二十四年以來，人民的生活，日見低下；東省失陷，內戰連年；四年內遭了兩次六十年來所未有之大水災，災區廣大，災民遍地；農村破產，經濟崩潰，銀行錢莊的倒閉，商店工廠的關門；失學失業的大量增加，人民生活陷入于普遍的貧窮和困苦。</p>
<p>總理是那樣的努力，而後人是如此之無用。國父有靈，也將痛哭于九泉吧？二十餘年來，中國未見好起來，只見壞下去，我們將何以對先烈？何以對自己？</p>
<p>今年之國慶，又有何可「慶」？</p>
<p>今日之中國，所以陷於如此之境地者，一方面固由於自身之不長進，一方面也實由於强鄰之欺壓。以此觀之，救國救民之道，仍不外那些老調：全國應亟消除成見，精誠團結，節省無益之浪費，盡全國之人力財力，共禦外侮，努力建設；政府應以人民之主張為主張，人民也應團結於政府領導之下。</p>
<p>「只有自己才能救自己」！我們中國也是如此。一切依靠國聯，信賴公理，都是自欺欺人的話！</p>
<p>誠然，今年的國慶是苦痛的，悲哀的。但是，不要緊。只要能夠從今覺悟，全國同胞本着總理大公無私的遺囑，堅苦奮鬥的精神，去為民族國家而奮鬥。任何阻碍都可排除，任何艱難都可克服，我們有四萬萬人民，我們有四萬萬顆熱的心和鐵的頭！</p>
<p>德意志，蘇聯，土耳其，世界上擺着最好的例子，</p>
<p>我願意，我祝福，今日既是中華民國的誕生日，更是中華民國的新生日！</p>
<h3 id="c242">二十四年國慶感言 <a href="#c242" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e242" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">242</a></h3>
<p>— 行安</p>
<p>四年來的國慶，因為國家在國難時期，吊之不暇，何敢言慶，故都於草草紀念中度過去。今天又是二十四年的國慶，國府通告全國，一切皆照去年辦法舉行。國人欣逢此開國節日，雖覺國內依然瘡痍滿目，無心歡呼，但十月十日，在民國歷史上，畢竟有其重大的意義。故大家來表示一番慶祝，亦是應當的</p>
<p>然我們要如何表示慶祝呢？開紀念會，寫紀念文，都是一種形式而已。眞實的紀念，國人須充分認識我國目前處境的艱困，共同負起匹夫之責，努力為國，將國家從風雨飄搖中，拯救出來。蓋中國的前途，危機四伏，大難方多，故救亡圖存，是今日國人應有的覺悟，民族復興，在此一舉。我們焉能醉生夢死，不思振作，坐視國家的衰敗呢？語云，多難興邦，我國幾年來的內憂外患，或許可以促進我們走上强盛之路。</p>
<p>至救亡圖存之策，只有一途，即自力更生是。歷史的敎訓，使我們知道一國的生存，要靠自己的力量，倚賴外力，正足以速其滅亡，至多亦只茍延殘喘於一時。故我國今後要望打開國難，復興民族，必須全國人能上下一心，抱最大的犧牲，奮發前進，我們應以堅毅的精神，勇武的行為，苦幹的態度，努力來救中國。要知中國是四萬萬國人的中國，我們不努力，自救，還乞誰來帮助呢？</p>
<p>憶自民國成立至今，已有二十四年的歷史。在我們已經受盡了許多的痛苦。但此不去說它。看看現時的情形，東菲戰事已發，世界大局堪虞，明年又是一個危機的一九三六年。大難當前，國人要保持中國民國光榮的史跡，應繼承先烈的遺志，準備為國家流血。</p>

<h3 id="c244">略論音樂喜劇 <a href="#c244" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e244" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">244</a></h3>
<p>— 徐正儀</p>
<p>梁戈里曾說過喜劇的價值有時是會超過了悲劇的。</p>
<p>當然我們不能就這樣一概而論，悲劇的暴露了黑暗而陰慘的不合理的事件，使親眾流淚，使親眾同情，使觀眾從流淚中，同情中，對不合理的事件的根因會發生一種嫉恨，由嫉恨而蛻化到對不合理的事件的根因的憤激和仇視。</p>
<p>但是，正如前人所說過的一樣，現實的一切醜惡，一切虛偽，一切詐欺，一切假仁假義，在詼諧的，發噱的喜劇的形式下，使觀眾對終現實的醜惡，康偽，欺詐，有一種真切的認識，使觀眾在笑得熱淚迸流，前俯後仰，在熱淚迸流中，在前俯後仰中，對現實的虛偽，欺詐，有一抹輕藐，由輕化蛻藐而到對不合理的事件的根因的篾視和痛心疾首。</p>
<p>喜劇與悲劇雖然在戲劇的形式上，在按巧上——倒如前者係輕快，明朗，比較放蕩一些，而後奢乃係沉着，堅穀，比較嚴肅一些——在題材的取選上，有其自身之差異，但是在所收到的效果上却是沒有什麽分別的。</p>
<p>也許可以這樣說，喜劇所收到的效果或者會比悲劇所收到的效果更多一些，更容易一些。</p>
<p>為什麽呢？有人或許會問。</p>
<p>悲劇，在處理的丰法上，在題材的選擇上，的確是比較喜劇來得困難的，譬如說吧，假如處理的手法一不當心，便很容易使人起一種沉悶，苦澁，煩養之據，假如題材的選擇稍一疏忽，便很容易陷入感傷主義，出氣主義，甚至是「蠻苦格，會賣銅鈿」主義的。</p>
<p>但是喜劇却不然，因為題材的幫助，在處理的手法上得到很多的便利，因為處理的手法上得到了很多的便利而得到很多的效果，同時只要是揭發了虛偽，醜惡，欺詐，在題材的選擇上，喜劇是較之悲劇方便得多。</p>
<p>單是題材的一方面的幫助，喜劇的處理的手法和所獲得的效果是會更多，更容易，那末，再加上了最能增張喜劇上的效果的聽覺上的幫助，喜劇所收到的效果是會超過了悲劇的。</p>
<p>所謂聽覺上的幫助，是指合乎喜劇內容的節奏的音樂和強調了的音響。</p>
<p>喜劇，在題材上，在處理的手法上已經具備了上述的便利，要是能够處理得不失差的話，是很容易使人哭得熱淚交迸，前俯後仰的，再加上了音樂的配奏，強調了視覺，那在所得效果的量上，是很可觀的。</p>
<p>所以音樂喜劇的價值與效果是會超過了一般喜劇，而喜劇的價值與效果是會超過了一般悲劇的。——當然，好的內容還得具備了好的形式，才能得到很高的價值與很大的效果的。</p>
<h3 id="c245">演員與個性 <a href="#c245" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e245" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">245</a></h3>
<p>— 邦</p>
<p>真的，演員頂主要的，倒不是笑和哭時的深刻的表情，而是抓住劇中人的個性，而充量發揮它。</p>
<p>要是一個演員能緊緊把握住了劇中人的個性，而把它充量表演了出來之後，他，或她就是一個成功的演員。反之，假如一二場哭笑的場面演得好，而對整個劇中人的個性不能緊緊抓住，充分發揮，那他或她不能算是一個好的演員。</p>
<p>個性就好比一個人的靈魂，假如不抓住劇中人的靈魂而想扮演劇中人扮演得怎樣成功是不可能的。</p>
<p>看了「都市風光」的試片後，我先在這裏提出了演員的演技。有好幾個演員是新上銀幕的，但是劇中人的個性可以說是他們都很抓得很緊的。不論是新的或舊的演員，在「都市風光」裏都能很明顯地表演出了劇中人的個性，原因是他們知道演員與個性的關係。</p>
<p>丟媚眼，弄風騷，翻門檻，不知戀愛只知修飾的摩登小姐張新珠，有時儍，有時不大老實的，繼愛至上主義者兼青年作家唐納，土頭土腦，在家怕老婆，出外擺空架子的土老兄周伯勳，玩弄女性，作威作福，空撐闊場面的市儈顧夢鶴，嬌憨，天真，不知此外世界可知道有一個小姐的傻丫頭白璐，媚，溫柔，一點外快的上海小姐藍蘋，謟　，吹，抖亂廿心供驅使的秘書蔡若虹，都主裏幾個典型人物的個性抓得非常緊的，要是這些演員能够說是成功的話，那末是成功在他們對劇中人的個性的把握上。</p>

<p>我不懂電影，但是歡喜有電影，悲的，喜的，「蠻苦格」的，滑轄的，中國的，外國的，只要袋裏有錢，我都要看。</p>
<p>前天夜裏有個音樂朋友打了個電話來問我要看「都市風光」嗎？不要化錢的。有電影看，又不要我化錢，何樂而不為？</p>
<p>半個鐘頭後我就坐在電通公司的映片間裏一段一段悅耳的音樂，一堆一堆的發噱的笑料，從我的耳際，眼前掠過，大有耳不暇收，目不暇接之勢，但是雖然坐的是一隻便桌凳，我却忘了前月復發了的痔瘡的痛苦。</p>
<p>「都市風光」裏的音樂，「都市風光」裏的笑料，是和我以前所聽見所看見的中國影片裏的大不同了，甚而和外國片子裏的也大不相同，我就問我隔壁的那個朋友，但是他却嘻開了嘴，只管望着那塊小小的銀幕，沒有聽見我。</p>
<p>我以為他是有意不理我，就不再問他，後來我回來就問別個朋友，還把「都市風光」裏配的怎麽樣怎麽樣的音樂，做得怎麽樣怎麽樣的有趣，告訴了他，那個朋友就問我難道你不知道「都市風光」裏請了中國許多的著名音樂專家來作曲作譜，配音嗎，難道你不知道「都市風光」裏請了中外各國的許多著名樂師來彈奏嗎？我回答他那個請我去看的音樂朋友沒有告訴我。</p>
<p>他笑了，就繼續問我？你知道不知道喜劇裏有低級趣味和高級趣味，有「硬滑稽」和「現成笑料」，有做作和天然等等分別嗎？我想騙他也沒有道理，就老老實實說不知道。</p>
<p>他更笑了，他就還問我，「你看的時候笑了沒有？」我說笑了。「大笑了沒有」？我說大笑了。「狂笑了沒有」？我說狂笑了。他還問我笑過了覺得有意思沒意思呢？我就說的的確確內為有意思，我才笑的，我才大笑了，我才狂笑了。</p>
<p>我的朋友拍了拍我的頭，就說「對了，所以都市風光就和你所看過的中外影片不同！」說完他就自管自走了。</p>
<p>什麽對了？什麽不同？我還弄不清楚，好的，反正上次揩油，自己沒出錢，等明天再去看他個分明。</p>

<p>某鄕之一小車站，有農民棄農具羣趨上海，候車時適有一玩西洋鏡者，正歌唱求售，於是有父，母，甥，女四人，趨觀焉。</p>
<p>鏡中所映，「都市風光」也：</p>
<p>都市中，青年李夢華正擊裝出門，罄其所有之二十元，為戀人購一絨綿衫，持往贈之。至則適遇一人昂然自女寓出，固其情敵王俊三也。入則女父正因家庭經濟問題與女母爭吵。盛怒而下，女為介紹之餘，父出赴其與人合設之小押店籌欵；女則約男往觀電影，李囚囊空如洗，窘甚，乃以先往購票為托辭，亟以一錶，馳赴押店，當洋兩元，方足敷券資，戲散時，又遇王俊三，豪闊非李所敵，女允王請，別李而入其汽車，李怏甚，長歎而已。</p>
<p>李乃博覽羣籍，作情書抵女所，時女正因女友婚，央作伴娘，方熟籌其新裝也。諸凡衣帽皮鞋皮包之類，俱付缺如。因迫父共往押店設法，仍不得要領，幸女友邀赴服裝公司，往取為其所製作娘新裝一襲以贈，付賬時見女又欲定製大衣，急遁去，女遂以電話致王，佯謂門日請來寓喫麵，屆時王果携生日禮往，安知花籃而外，仍一無補實際之洋娃娃耳。女又引為失望，因約往咖啡館小坐，圖另籌妙計，不料王以要事不克同行，而由其秘書陳某偕往，至則以爭欲付賬，陳奪其皮包置座上，女暗以足踢之，輕輕落地下，嗣文階赴服裝公司取所定大衣，付欵時佯作已失其皮包，反怒責陳不應與之爭會鈔，陳無奈乃先為其付却大衣賬。</p>
<p>女父因年關緊迫，以押店承押各物，轉售舊貨店，不果，乃擬轉質大當誧，又不果，囚將各物車回寓所，合家歡然，引為大財源之來寓也。孰知所有各物，但破舊不堪，女所需，仍付缺如，乃又致電予王，佯謂所贈洋娃娃有損壞處，請將發票送來，其意固欲以洋娃娃換取他項物件也。王果將發票送來，視之，則赫然三十元，初不料洋娃娃若是之貴也，於是皮包，皮鞋，俱無足慮，僅缺一帽而已。</p>
<p>聖誕節屆，李夢華以所作情書，投諸報館，得稿費二元，持一帽籠抵女所，固禮物也。女婢見之，喜告女，以為帽得矣，啟視之，則李所蓄之犬耳。時女正盛裝，約　陪往　舞，舞場需門票各一元，李乃傾其囊購票，匆卒間忽將當票作鈔票用。及覺，　　甚，摸李久之，得所餘一元票予之。入場後，女又運呼高價飲料，李感生立不安，幸遇王俊　之秘書，乃急謀脫身。不一時，王至，歡舞之餘，挾赴王寓，女醉而失身。黎明，女返，　遇其父服其押店取回西裝清早出門，猶以女亦方欲早出也。</p>
<p>女父母偵知女私，並悉王為茶棧經理，女父因謀迫王與女婚，俾可解決年關問題，乃　偕其女抵王所，時王方與劉某作某項交易，劉謂其年內必須交貨，而女父亦迫王年內必須　女結婚也。翌日，李夢華聞女訂婚訊，急赴女處責問，女怒以情書　還之，懊喪之餘，李返寓思自殺，致絕命書予女。女趨慰之，知其固尚朱服毒，乃又忿去。利那間，李又大聲呼　，全屋震驚，趨集，輒欲報捕房，李急，乃謂自往醫院，致笑話百出。</p>
<p>王與女婚後，以投機揮霍，亦漸露窘態。年關緊迫，百思不解，乃再赴市場作孤注一擲，不意又遭失敗，留書致女而逃。時其秘書已與女婢私，先王席捲私奔。待女父來探，如行發覺，乃亟偕女追赴車姑，則車已嗚嗚開矣！</p>
<p>急迫一時，突為鐘聲所驚，蓋車開者車至也。以上種種，均西洋鏡中所映耳。四人面而相睹，初為候車而來，至此竟不知何所適從。</p>

<h3 id="c252">今年的國慶 <a href="#c252" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e252" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">252</a></h3>
<p>— 乾序</p>
<p>中華民國成立了二十四年，便過了二十四度的國慶。雖然每一度的國慶的環境不同，但總是在國勢飄鋼，凄凉景况之中，則差不多是一致的。</p>
<p>或者有人說，所謂「慶」，必須要帶點喜慶的情緒去過，方纔有味兒，我國年來內憂外患，天災人禍，交相煎迫，吾人悲哀警惕之不暇，還能提出甚麽興味，來作此無謂的例行的慶祝？關於這，我於去年今日的本刊裏，曾經說過，紀念國慶的意義，决不是單純地歡欣鼓舞，表示慶祝：而是要籍此作一番有力的檢討，看是不是已經對得住先烈雄壯的熱血，旣擲的頭顱？和有沒有完成先烈未完的使侖？所以，在國慶日作紀念國慶的文字，也並不是點綴時令，而是乘此機會，再來作一番提撕而已。</p>
<p>然而今年的國慶，又是怎樣一個現狀呢？</p>
<p>東菲方面，正在作着豪强壓迫弱小的戰爭，意大利伸出巨爪，張開大口，阿比西尼亞已成俎上之肉，但當作最後之掙扎。不過，阿此西尼亞在國際間的關係，非常複雜，雖然日內瓦的國聯盟約早已根本失其效用，但各列强爲了維護自己的利益，也决不肯聽意大利恣所欲爲而不加問聞。抵須分　稍有不均，國際間的矛盾，便會完全暴露出來：地中海的砲聲，便會從前廢曆過年的鞭爆一樣響起來的。第二次世界大戰的序幕，到此時就完全拉開了。在這裏，我們必須注意，地中海第一聲砲響的時候，我們中國，必也成爲多事之秋，這是無法倖免的。</p>
<p>國內方面，最使人驚心慘目的，便是重演民二十年的大水災，災區之廣，受災之慘，尤非民二十年所可及，我們袛看偃師全城覆沒於前，窰灣全鎭慘吿陸沉於後，黃河，長江，運河之水，同時泛濫，現已入秋，水勢非特未退，出險决口之事，報紙上尚日有記載。民二十年之瘡痍未復，何堪再受此大刦，兼之連年災荒，不景氣之狀態，日益嚴重，國民經濟，國家資力，已萬分衰微，差不多已到了萬刦不復的地位了！</p>
<p>但是上海，上海畢竟是天空，因了全國的大水災，便有花選賑災，明星伴舞振災等等的新鮮玩意兒，從今日起，上海空前盛况的本屆全運會又開幕了，我們的老爺少爺們大可以換點新鮮刺激受受，不過，但願有興高彩烈躬逢盛舉之餘，放眼四顧，看看四伏的當前危機。</p>
<p>還有，還有東北四省得失地未復，但不知本屆全運會結束時，尚能讀到「「字一淚不忍卒讀」的「東北五省健兒吿別書」否？</p>
<h3 id="c253">家書 <a href="#c253" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e253" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">253</a></h3>
<p>— 華穆</p>
<p>離家久了，生活又常給困頓在顚沛不安的泥潭主動脈，這些暗淡的歲月，漸漸把鮮躍的易感的心情硬化了，對於一切都看成給蒙上一層灰暗的色素，覺得什麽都是空虛與殘酷的·年齡，世故，使我了然自己的生存意義：家雖溫暖可戀，在某一個時期裏，生活的鞭子自會把你打出來的，在這鐵鞭鞭策之下，我捱着一些，苦的日子，也失去了孩稚的眞性，僵化的心情中，使我惦記的是肩背上的生活的創痕，看得到的是鞭子的黑影和受難的自身。這些灰暗的日子裏，對於家，我已很是淡然的了。</p>
<p>雖然，我也並不完全就和家斷了一切關聯的，困窘的生活雖使我對於家的繫念變了淡漠，但我知道，這個隔落在關由千里的無羗的家，可還是非常惦念我的一切，把我當作是它將來的砥柱的。我的一切眞實的消息，雖然早給生活的暗影吞　掩抑了去，這個家，可還是一樣熱切關心，用着種種巧妙的方法，寄下許多甜蜜的慰安來探問我，　絆我，這就是一月或兩月長久日子裏，忽然投到我手裏來的一封塗了不少風　油漬的家書了。</p>
<p>在這時候，我是常常很受感動的，我會突然忘掉擺在眼前的灰暗的日子，一反一向對於家的淡漠之情，在那寥寥的幼稚的字句裏，沒有一字一句不使我深深感動，有時直至感動得落淚！這種心情的激動，是不能用理智來過抑的，我自己也不解其所以然，這完全是猝然而來的昇降，事前無可捉摸？就好像迷途的孩子，受了幾許驚駭委曲，一旦投在母觀懷裏，在母愛的撫慰溫存之下，不知是喜是悲，只有任情一哭，一肚委曲，纔得消去。古人所謂「家書抵萬金」，其意思也許就可作如是解的罷。不然我可無法估出其「抵萬金」價值在那兒。</p>
<p>自然每次的家書，都總是吿訴我它是無恙，平安，最後又歸結到那句「不必介念，留心寒暖，」作結束。從這些字句裏，都可以看出有意無意的在傳達這個家對我的熱切的關懷，它總以爲飄泊的遊子時常都在那凄風孤館之中思念着家難過。事實上雖然時相反了，但我可不特不對於這個家的簡單的想作撩起厭惡或加以竊笑，其感動我的可正在這平淡無奇的地方。在這些百寫不變的口語裏，我體味到這個家到底是無限溫暖和慈愛，它的「人間味」還是全璞無瑕，只有它是永遠關切我，相信我，在這渺漠陰冷的宇宙裏，使我還能摸觸到一些人生的溫暖。這就是值得我爲它威動，下淚的地方。</p>
<p>可是，我也是相信歷史的殘酷的。這個家的命運總有走到末路的時候，死亡，破產，分解，什麽倫理孝弟的大義，結果都一無可用，全會失了它舊有的光輝的。我也白吃自己，這些日子卽已漸漸背着這個家走着歷史排給我的路道了，我也將永無能力去挽扶那個將來崩落下去的家。因爲事實和經腰已吿訴我英雄造時勢的時代已走過去了，個人的能力是無法把歷史拖着倒走的，到了那時候，我又是否會爲這崩落在歷史的殘酷下的家悲痛呢，我想這最好讓我拿目則的心情和生活境界來解答罷。</p>
<p>不過，在眼前我確也還需要一月兩月苦　的日子裏能够接到一兩封充滿溫暖慈愛意味的家書，來溫存溫存一下這僵化的心情，也許等到寫在紙上的已沒有了「不必介念留心寒暖」的字句，而全是不忍卒讀的悲慘的叙述的時候，那時我也就可以死去這個念頭了。</p>
<h3 id="c254">水鄉雜寫 <a href="#c254" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e254" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">254</a></h3>
<p>— 里昂</p>
<p>菱花</p>
<p>我從小就愛吃菱，尤愛吃生菱，故鄉的菱是綠皮的，肉潔白鮮嫩，我總是逼着媽媽或姊姊剝給我吃，自己不敢剝，因爲怕被菱角刺痛，和怕刺蝟的尖刺一一樣。十五六歲的時候就自己動手了，雖有時仍會被刺痛，或竟手指被刺出血來，然己威覺到從痛苦中得來的食品，是格外的甘美了。</p>
<p>闊別了七八年的故鄉的家，已經憔悴得多了，發光的黃色桐油大門灰黯了，媽媽容顏蒼老了，可憐的姊姊在嫁後，因小產而死去。還有什麽能够挑起我幼年的回憶呢？除掉那屋子前一湖塘的菱花。</p>
<p>不論在朦朧的晨曦或在迷茫的薄暮，我總是帶着一點痴情，孤獨地站在水橋上，望着一簇一簇菱花臨着塘而上的微風而搖拽，我愛它幽然不俗的風格，我愛它文靜的淡淡的紫色，它隱處於稀薄蘆葦中，似乎不願同世俗上任何一種花朶比美，它站在翠綠的菱葉盤上，除掉靑蛙對它咯咯小唱外，絕對受不着人們炙熱的手底接觸。假使下一陣暴雨，被冲落的花瓣，亦笑着似的，靜悄悄地飄浮於水面，而並不顯露一絲乞憐的意態</p>
<p>姊姊活着的時侯亦深愛菱花的，她愛它柔和的姿容中又含着剛毅的骨氣。</p>
<p>『犂兒，再息幾天有菱好吃了。』媽媽在門口望着我說：『你是最愛吃菱的。「</p>
<p>可是，我馬上又要被生活的颶風吹離去故鄉的，我沒有餘暇等菱吃，我袛希望菱花慢慢地凋謝，說不定，在生活的旅途上，會溫一個淡淡的紫色的夢的，在夢中，會見着我姊姊的微笑。</p>
<p>小魚</p>
<p>自從爹爹出了遠門，湖塘裏就沒養過魚，一則沒人飼餵魚秧，二則沒人看守大魚，年老力衰的媽媽擔任不了這種事務，何况近幾年來的家鄉情形不比從前了，常常有偷盜失竊的事件發生，猪牛都會被偷走，湖塘裏的魚更不必說了。記得小時候在家跟姊姊到水橋上淘米，總見尺把長的的魚浮上水面吮吸碎米屑，而現在獨個子跑上水橋時，在心坎，陡湧起一陣空虛的感覺。</p>
<p>大的魚影不見了，在水草浮萍間，只有成羣的一二寸長的小魚在忽忙地游着來，又掉頭游着去，這是野魚秧，很難長大供人煮食，起初，我以爲它們的生命很有保障，决不會受漁人的捕捉。那個吃客要吃這樣小的魚呢？</p>
<p>然而，不幸的一幕終於見到了，當我問：『你們網捕這許多小魚有什麽用？』而漁人回答說：『縛在鐵鈎子上去釣大魚！』的時候，我戚覺受着一種極端殘忍和乖戾的重壓。世界上還有比『利用同類相吞殺而自已坐享福利』更罪惡毒辣些的行爲嗎？</p>
<h3 id="c255">窗間的透視 <a href="#c255" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e255" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">255</a></h3>
<p>— 胡思</p>
<p>從窗間，我可以看見外面整個的世界。任何宇宙萬象，儘管是變化萬端，一從一個孔隙間透進來，便可和我接觸着了。這情形不管是窗的面積大小，便是小至像針孔般大，還不能够阻止我和外界的交通的。</p>
<p>從一個有限的孔隙間去窺視外面的景象，不但宇宙的全體不會消失，甚且還能集中注意力，使所見的景象越加顯明起來。用望遠鏡去窺視天象，或用顯微鏡云窺視微小的物體，都是具有很大的效用的。我常常用這種道理到藝術觀上去。試把手臂倚在窗檻上，我的視綫當然受窗框的阻攔，但是我還可以看遠方的樹木，屋宇，和人物。我可以看見飛鳥迥翔，我也可以看見炊姻四起；我可以看見天空的雲霞變化，我也可以看見大風吹落樹葉，或霏霏雨雪，從天空向地下撒散。在都市，街中人羣的擾攘和汽車爬行的框匆，我可以看得到；霓紅燈的閃亮和一切都市的動態，我都可以從一個窗框間看出來。在農村，耕牛的辛勤，農人的勞作，一切耕耘以至收穫，一切的天時變幻，都可以從一個小小的草舍的窗縫間顯露在眼前。如果是住在山間吧，山巖的突元，山草的姜綠，瀑布的傾瀉，和山林的繁茂，都可以從一個小窗間一目瞭然。此外如山雨欲來，山谷　陷，所有的山景變化，所有的山間面目，一架窗框是不能阻止人對於山的了解和親密戚的。</p>
<p>從輪船艙中的小窗，儘管窗子是小得只有個小小的圓形，而海的壯觀和美麓還不能遮住我的親近的。那波浪的起伏，那海鳥的飛翔，那帆船　滿着的鳳</p>
<h2>Page 39</h2>
<p>帆，和那被風掃起的一個個雪白的浪花，都會一一地從窗間飛過和逝去的。雖然那景象是一幕換上一幕，有如電影的鏡頭般地一下子出現，一下子便又消滅了。但是誰能說那不是眞實的海的面貌，那不是海的壯觀呢？誰又能說那在甲板上所見的景象，會完全和這不同的呢？更何况從窗框中所見的海，更爲有趣，和更富於藝術感的呀！</p>
<p>從堅獄小的窗欄中窺見外面的世界，那景象是更爲令人激動，和發生更爲深刻的印象的啊！你想那灰黑的墻壁，那殘酷的人間構圖，那兵士和獄官的兇惡的面相，是多麽令人對監獄的整體發生深深的瞭解的呵！，幸而所住的窗間掛近工作塲所，或小小的一方曠塲，或小小的一方菜園，那久被禁錮的抑鬱的心，一旦能望見那小的一方小天，或小小的一片菜葉的綠色，或甚至只是一塊小木頭，或一小片磚瓦，在耳目久被單調和呆板所硬化的時候，看起來是多麽令人發生親熱感呢！</p>
<p>自然人如果能够在一處好風景的地方造下一間別墅，從窗間去攝取天地的靈秀，那是最爲幸福的了。從山上俯見大河村市，或從海岸邊遠視沙灘小嶼，晨夕看日出月落，午夜視潮流漲落，那是多麽富於詩情，也多麽富於藝術性的呢！</p>
<p>從窗間看風吹，雨打，看靑色的鬼火，看鮮艷的霓紅燈，……總之，看宇市的一切，看人類所造成的豐富景象，如果能用藝術家的一隻眼，能取得電影攝取鏡頭的角度，那眞是無限的欣賞，無限地幣視人間的方法，也無限地令人發，生好感的啊！</p>

<p>明星的話劇「月兒彎彎」本說是在中秋節上演的，臨時因爲排演不及，改爲雙十節上演，可是雙十節偏偏又逢到全運匯開慕，於是爲了「生意眼」起見，又得延期上演，現在是暫時以「夜來香」來擋一陣，因爲「夜來香」的輿論，各方面尚不錯也。</p>

<p>— 記者</p>
<p>近代以還。建築之術。造詣日精。發展益盛。不必遠徵諸歐美各國也。卽以我國言之。各地競言建設。而建設莫先於建築。無論公立私立之機關第宅。日有增益。輪焉奐焉。凡旅游南北者。類能道之。無待統計而後明也。</p>
<p>建築之技術。與文明之程度。相互遞衍。以爲推進。中國爲文化先進之國家。故建築之技術。無論宮室以至橋樑城寨之工程在在均足表示其成績。惟自晚近西法。愈臻精勝以來。於是言建築者。多捨舊而崇新。中國古代之建築。轉且淪爲絕學。卽對於舊建築之結構材料。亦莫不謀保存而昌大之。而一時國內風起雲湧之新建築。遂多借才於異地。由客籍工程師。經營而爲之設計焉。</p>
<p>中國自有工程師學會以來。凡言建築。治工程者。莫不薈萃於是。合全國專門之人才於一堂。以探討其技術。以窮究其設施。於是言新建築者。乃得此爲星宿淵泉之海。而諸君子亦多各出新學。以謀宗邦建築事業之發展。此在社會之學術團體中。固極其可貴而難能。而其於我國國家建設之輔助。厥功亦且更偉。膾炙人口。無俟贅陳。且諸君子初則致意於經畫欵制。繼乃更進於材料製品。而國產之建築材料。遂得乘時以崛起於市塲。用代舶來之品。由茲孟晋。其關係固且不僅於建築之一端。而實影響及於國家之隆替矣。</p>
<p>本報夙以振導建設爲職志。尤知建築之重要。則嘗從事於建築周刋矣。乃者工程師學會。復以國產建築材料事。與本報輯此特刋。於雙十國慶之令辰發之。夫提倡國產。自當與振導建設。爲正比例之推行。則凡所建設。庶不致流而爲漏巵。此固舉國人士所共企而同情者。本報得於役其間。寗非引爲幸事。行見建設之事業日盛。國產之材料日豐。而國家亦且日臻於富强之域。敢以此爲噶矢。期與國人。共策勵之。於其發行也。爲致此詞。用資喤引。</p>

<h3 id="c269">最近十五年之上海磚瓦業 <a href="#c269" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e269" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">269</a></h3>
<p>— 柳子賢</p>
<p>我國土製磚瓦，品質乖劣，加之坏戶之粗製濫造，尺寸厚薄，殊不一律，於建築房屋，頗多妨碍，於是磚瓦業，有新式磚瓦廠之設。</p>
<p>上海一埠，白瑞好磗瓦廠，彷造法國式紅平　，繼之而起者，有嘉善之陶新，及泰山磚瓦廠，宜興華蓋磗瓦廠，亦於是時創立三廠均製靑紅平瓦，行銷上海，及附近各埠，已而泰山創辦新廠於滬南新龍華，購辦新機，建造美國式圓窰，改良靑紅平瓦，創製各色白磚，及花色磚，開滬上建築界之新紀元。嗣後復有華新磚瓦廠，創於嘉善，專製靑　平瓦，信大窰廠，創於上海塘灣，華大磚瓦廠，創於上海野鷄墩，振蘇華興創於崑山，輪興創於嘉善，俱建有德國哈夫門連續窰，專製機磗紅瓦，同時美商在蘇州設有蘇州磚瓦廠，製造各色磚瓦，比商在上海周家橋，設有義品磚瓦廠，製造機磚紅瓦空心磚，空心磚爲新式之磗，滬人士尚爲初見，即而大中磚瓦廠，在浦東設有工廠，亦以製造機磚紅瓦空心磚爲出品大宗，與義品較，堪稱伯仲。最近東南磚瓦廠，崛起於閔行浦南，所出磚瓦，均稱上選。泰山未改平瓦前，市上所有貨品，大都質地未能堅實，除上海附近數家外，漢陽阜成裕記官廠，和興等廠，所出之瓦，莫不以上海爲尾閭，白泰山改革出品，各磚瓦廠，無不精心製造，本出品之改良，雖有限於機器窰墩，成色未能一律，但較之十年前出品，已不啻天壤之別，年來各廠復有英國式片瓦，西班牙式筒瓦，中國廟字式筒瓦之出，但每方所用數目多，價值高，非高貴房屋，不易需用此項貨品。</p>
<p>近來建築界，對於國貨磗瓦，無不樂於引用，以是各廠出品，頗多日新月異，杜塞漏斗，爲益非淺，面磚一項，自泰由創製以來，凡通部大邑，無不需用，最近該廠及開山，興業，等廠，復創製抽面磗，行銷漸廣，將來勢必爲人所樂用。泰山，開山，復製有琉瑙瓦，此雖北平舊工業，然在滬上，則新興事業之一也。</p>
<p>火磗一項，除開外澳，上海一埠，袛泰山，東南，端和，數家能供給，他廠固無此項設備，年來實業失敗，紗絲不振，所用火磗已較五年前銳减矣。</p>
<p>煤屑磚，曩時惟漢陽鐵廠，附設煤屑磚廠，能製造，上海雖曾有人在楊樹浦辦媒屑磗廠，以經營不善，不久停辦，近有長城磗瓦廠，創製煤屑磚瓦，行銷漸廣，亦滬人士未見之事業也。此磚除開灤外，上海無有能製造者，襄時泰山磚瓦廠，曾爲英工部局製有成數，顧以成本太高，售價不能低廉，未能繼續遂成絕饗。</p>
<p>舖地缸磗，爲唐山，啟新磁廠，開灤礦務局，宜興開山，磚瓦廠等數家所出，此亦近年新興之物。馬賽克舖地磁磚，及牆上磁磚，係啟　，益中，興業，三廠所出，品質佳良，較之舶來，己不多讓。</p>
<p>水泥地磚，曩時以啟新洋灰公司品爲最佳，光華，合衆，發康，等廠，銷數亦不少，近有華新磚瓦廠，設置水泥地磚部，辦有新式機器，出品頗有改革，與外貨較絕少軒輊。</p>
<p>年來磚瓦材料，十九爲國人所自製减少漏斗，殊爲可喜，所惜國人創辦工業，每喜步他人後塵，絕不另闢溪徑，磚瓦中，如陰溝瓦筒電綫瓦管，門頭花色磚沙灰磚軟泥磚，或爲滬人士未見之物，或爲普通用磚，而成本低廉，顧絕少爲磚瓦業所顧及，此則有望於各廠之努力研究，善爲提倡也。</p>
<p>上海市工業試駝所國貨建築材料在此舉行展覽歡迎各界參觀</p>
<h3 id="c270">鋼鐵鑄件對於建築上之用途 <a href="#c270" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e270" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">270</a></h3>
<p>大鑫鋼鐵工廠鋼鐵材料，在偉大建築物中，佔最重要地位，往昔鑄鋼，未會盛行之時，對於鋼架建築，除利用現成之工形工形等，各種鐵樑外，其接聯之處，皆用鐵板截劊而彎折之，使其適合，、然後鑽孔，釘成。自鑄鋼事業，漸行發達後，於是各式柱脚，（Pedestal）接頭底脚，（Joint　of　Principle　Rafter　with　End　of　Tie-bar）熱鐵，（BearingBlock　under　Girder　and　Girder　Shoe）樑鐵，（Girder　Shoe　or　Saddle）底板鐵（Fixed　Shoe-Flate　or　Bep-Plate）等，遂採用鑄鋼，以代鐵板，蓋不獨省工，而且耐久也。以鐵板集合而成之件，其抵持之能力，全在鉚釘，萬不能如鑄鋼之全體結成，爲牢固也。近年來，鑄鋼多用電爐，精煉，使品質優良，磷磺等，雜質，驅除殆盡，於是鋼伴鑄成後，雖不經碾軋，而其强力極高，故採用者益衆。我國大規模之鋼鐵工廠，尚未設立，其曾經設立者，亦已停辦鐵板之供給，全仰舶來，爲提倡國貨建築材料起見，更宜採用鑄鋼也，無疑義矣。</p>
<p>鑄鋼應用於建築上，有時可採用合金鑄鋼以應，特殊之需要，普通鑄銅中，加入少許銅質，則久露天空，而不至銹蝕，在建築上，於不能利用油漆以保護鋼質生銹之處，可以採用之。普通鑄鋼，加入少許鎳質，則彈性限度，（Elastic　Limit）卽可加增，因之能使鋼質，經多次繼續或交替之震動！壓力而不碎裂，在橋樑或特種受震動之建築工程上，可以採用之，普通鑄鋼，加入適當錳質，則鋼質堅硬，而不脆弱，在受極度磨擦之處，可以採用之。</p>
<p>鑄鐵在建築材料中，用以作撐柱，因其能受壓力而不能任拉力，且無靭性也。鑄鐵未經精煉，每方寸僅有拉力六噸至八噸，經合法之製煉，其拉力可增加至每方寸十六噸至二十噸，靭性亦能增進。若築入水泥混合土中，且能灣曲而不裂，且亦不斷，故在鐵筋混合土建築物中，以鑄鐵作鐵筋，亦有其歷史焉</p>
<p>馬鐵（Mlalleable　Lron）在建築材料中，除用以充管子接頭外，對於門窗以及欄杆之零件，多採用之，因其性質軟而靭，不如鑄鐵之脆弱，溶化時流動性與鑄鐵類似，對於澆鑄細薄零件，不如澆鋼之困難也。</p>
<h2>Page 46</h2>
<p>我國鑄鋼，及特種鐵之製煉事業，年來正在發靭之期，若能設法採用，則其用途，當不僅上述數端而已，爰據廠中工作記載之所有，就建集材料範圍所應用，摘錄而陳述之，深望　世建築專家，加以指正，海內同志，熱心提倡，舉凡熟鐵所不能錘成，而鐵板所不勝任者，鋼鐵鑄件，皆得有以補其缺，則我國之鑄　事業，或得藉以推廣於建築材料之中矣。</p>

<h3 id="c272">建築避水法 <a href="#c272" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e272" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">272</a></h3>
<p>— 鄭汝翼</p>
<p>吾國建築事業，晚近以來，與日俱進，工程日趨偉大，設計日趨週密，於是防水避潮，亦已認爲重要問題之一，蓋潮濕之於房屋，非特有損美觀，且碍衛生，其在工廠堆棧復有機器銹爛，貨物霉腐之虞，至於建築物之有地坑水塔者，則避水工程，更形重要。</p>
<p>吾國建築界向以舶來之油毛毡爲唯一避水材料。無論地坑或屋頂，幾無不探用之，自「內和法」Integral　Waterproofing發明後，始漸改用避水漿，因其簡省而功効耐久也。</p>
<p>避水工程，似甚簡單，而實則不然，因地坑避水法與墻垣避水法不同，而屋面避水法又與水塔避水法各異，所需材料更非二三種卽足應付，茲就管見，將房屋各部份之避水方法，彙述於后，以供建築家麥考焉。</p>
<p>（一）屋頂</p>
<p>新水泥屋頂——用足量鋼骨以防房屋走動而致屋面龜裂，及適宜之「排水」佈置。鋼骨水泥內和入避水漿百份之二（以所用水泥之重量計算）安置時須錘打周密，面上粉一…二水泥灰漿一寸厚內和避水漿或避水粉百份之四，於二三日內時時灑水以防拆裂。（夏季須用潮濕之木屑或草蒂遮蓋之）</p>
<p>凡已做好之水泥屋面欲避水者，（甲）用膠珞油塗刷三次（此物不變水泥屋面之色澤或形狀（乙）用油毛毡，（丙）塗漆避水漆（黑色）二度。</p>
<p>新白鐵屋頂——先用淡酷揩抹一次，待乾後，於頂頭及接縫處用紙筋漆嵌好，隔二三日後，將屋頂全部塗漆避水漆一次。此漆能防漏防銹。非常經濟。</p>
<p>破漏屋面——無論老水泥屋面，油毛毡屋頂或銹爛之白鐵屋頂，袛須將破裂處用紙筋漆塡補。然後用避水漆塗漆一二次。非常簡省便利。</p>
<p>（二）墻垣：</p>
<p>新水泥墻——鋼骨水泥內和入避水漿百份之二·外面細沙內和此漿百份之四。</p>
<p>新磚墻及石墻——（甲）砌磚石之灰漿內和入避水漿百份之二·接縫處不可留有罅隙。（乙）於墻垣砌就後。將內面刷凈。塗刷避潮漆一次。然後粉紙筋于其上。</p>
<p>漏水墻垣——（甲）如不欲改變外墻之原有色澤及花紋（如面磚墻）可刷透明避水漆二次。但如有裂縫及罅隙。如先用灰漿塡嵌之。（乙）若黑色無碍美觀者。塗漆避水漆一度於外面。（丙）先將平面鑿毛（如係磚石墻。須將嵌綫鑿去。）用水濕透。粉一…二水泥灰漿一寸原。內和避水漿百份之四。</p>
<p>（三）地板：</p>
<p>水泥地板——三合土內和入避水漿百份之二以避潮氣。如地面鬆脆者。可塗保地精三次。卽可使之堅硬耐久。</p>
<p>瑪賽克及他種磁磚地板——（甲）水泥灰漿內和入避水漿百份之二以防潮氣侵入。（乙）先漆避水漆二次或紙筋漆一度子地面。然後用常法敷設瑪賽克或磁磚。</p>
<p>（四）地坑，地道等：</p>
<p>新建地坑——用足景鋼骨及適宜之「排水」佈置。建築時須掘三四甚深之小池或溝渠。以便將地下積水，隨時抽出（抽水須俟地坑三合土稍乾方可停止）鋼骨水泥內和入避水漿百份之四。</p>
<p>漏水地坑——（甲法）若水由墻垣劇烈侵入。須先將地坑外面之泥十掘出以减少壓力。並將積水隨時抽去。（如內墻不過印水。則此舉可省去之）漏水之孔穴用水泥調特快精塡塞之（特快精能使水泥于十餘秒鐘內堅結）然後將墻之內面鑿毛。一…二水泥灰漿半寸厚。內和快燥精百份之四。以防水冲入。隔日再粉一……二水泥灰漿八分厚內和避水漿百份之四。待乾燥後。將掘出之泥土返置原處。</p>
<p>（乙法）將地坑外之泥土掘出。待地坑乾燥後。塗刷避水漆二次於墻之外表。隔二三日後。將泥土返置原處。</p>
<p>（五）水塔，游泳池等——可參照地坑避水法</p>
<p>按鄭汝冀君係雅禮製造廠創辦人。對於房屋避水方法及材料之製造有十餘年之研究。篇中所述各材料。該廠均有出售。事務所在大陸商塲</p>

<h3 id="c273">中國工程師學會概况 <a href="#c273" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e273" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">273</a></h3>
<p>（甲）侵史</p>
<p>民國元年，工程界先進詹天佑氏時任廣東粤漢鐵路總理，約集同志在廣州創立中華工程師會，詹氏任會長，同時顏德慶屠慰曾等在上海創立工學會顏氏任會長，徐文慛等又創辦鐵路同人其濟會徐氏任會長。至此工程界人蹶狀興趣，咸知團體之需要，同時設立有三會之多，雖其命名組織，略有不同，而所抱宗旨，無非欲求工程學術之發達，人才之集中，以互助精神，爲國家社會服務相當之任務耳。惟其時任工程學者尚尠，三會會員人數約略相等各六七十人，已能按期開會，討論技術，列印會報，發揚學識，以喚起國人對於工程技術之認識，而知建設之需要論者多之。民國二年，適詹顏兩氏均在漢口主粤漢川鐵路建築事，工程學者來集漸多，當提議欲求會務發達，應爲進一步之合作，三會幷立，殊途同歸，母寗併而爲一，則志同道合，團體愈堅，遂决議三會合併，定名爲中華工程師學會，公舉詹氏爲正會長，顏氏副之，其會員依土木，機械，電氣，鑛冶，兵工，應用化學，造船等門類，分爲正會員，會員，副會員三種，由此會務日益發達，遂以當時政府在北，會址遷至北平，由詹氏提倡，各會員盡力捐互在西城報子街購置廣女地基，建築適宜會所，按期出版會報，每年舉行年會，每月舉行月會，歷年出版書籍甚多，尚能風行一世，詹氏並損有的欵，每年設獎徵求論文，截止民國十九年，正會員，會員，及副會員共計有五百人，其服務於政府實業及交通各機關，與夫敎育工商各界者甚多，咸能博得好論。</p>
<p>中國工程師學會於民國六年，由留美工程家二十餘人，發起組織成立，設會址於美國紐約，至七年卽與中國科學社舉行聯合年會。嗣後會務發展，趨向工程隕業及工程學術之途徑，年有進步，　種種活動限在美國境內。至民國十一年，會員回國者日多，總會始遷回我國設立上海，會務益形蒸蒸日上，其目標則更進一步，吩途向前，一爲試騐工業材料，一爲發刋會報及工程叢書？一爲參加國際工程學術會議，一爲增進工程職業地位與提高會員資格，一爲貢獻地方及政府實際建設意見與計畫，綜計十年之中，聲譽日隆，會員日多，截止民國二十四年，有二千七百九十四人（內團體會員十七家）包括計土木，化工，電機，機械，礦冶，等五大組；分會遍設上海，南京，天津，北平，漢口，靑島，濟南，杭州，長沙，梧州，廣州，南寗，蘇州，重慶，大冶，太原，唐山等處，連美國及歐洲，共計十八處之多，誠爲吾國工程學術之最大集會矣。</p>
<p>民國二十年春，兩會同人，僉以吾國工程學術尚在萌芽，亟應集中人才，力求進取，以圖進展，爰由華南圭，胡庶華，凌鴻勛，夏光宇，徐佩璜，韋以　，王繩善，唐在賢，薛次莘等九君，提議合併，草具意見書，徵求兩會會員同意，於同年八月兩命舉行聯合年會於首都，並議决兩會合併，改名爲中國工程師學會，舉韋以　氏爲首任會長，胡庶華氏爲副會長。二十一年秋，在天津開第二屆年會時，選顏德慶爲會長支秉淵爲副會長。二十二年秋，在武漢舉行第三屆年會，選薩福均爲會長，黃伯樵爲副會長二十三年秋在濟南舉行第四屆年會選徐佩璜爲會長，惲震爲副會長。二十四年八月在南寗舉行第五屆年會，選顏德慶爲會長，黃伯樵爲副會長。</p>
<p>（乙）工作一斑</p>
<p>本會以聯絡工程界同志，協力發展本國工程事業，並研究促進各項工程學術爲宗旨。所有工作均本此旨趣進行。茲將本會年來經辦之業務擇要述叙於後（一）工業材料考駝所之設立</p>
<p>（一）工業材料考騐所之設立</p>
<p>近年以來，吾國工業漸臻發達。本會有鑒於斯，爰於七載以前卽籌劃設立工業材料試騐所，以應需要。現在試騐所房屋已在上海市中心區建築完成，一俟機器設置就緒，卽可爲社會服務。尚望各界充分利用此項設備，以收合作之效。</p>
<p>（二）考察團之組織</p>
<p>近年各省政府對於開發實業，辦理建設，每委託本會組織考察團，代所調査籌劃。已見諸事實者有去年之四川考察團，今年之廣西考察團，皆經由便會徵集各項專門人才，分組工作，編具詳細報告貢獻於兩省當局，以備採納。</p>
<p>（三）工程叢書之編著</p>
<p>國人近年對於應用科學，均知注意研究，然此項書籍，極形缺乏。本會會員類皆學有專長，或於學理素有研究，或於經騐富有心得，自應盡其所知，編著成書，以貢獻於社會。現已出版者，有會員趙福靈君之「鋼筋混凝土」會員楊毅君之「機車概要」。卽將出版者，有會員陸增祺君之「機車鍋爐之保養及修理」。</p>
<p>（四）工程名詞之編訂</p>
<p>我國工程名詞大都譯自歐美各國。惟譯名錯雜，極不統一，對於我國工程學術發展之前途影響甚鉅。本會有鑒於此，乃於民國十七十八年間編印各種工程名詞，學者稱便。關於機械及電機兩種名詞早已擬成草案，初版發行，嗣因各界需要甚殷，已由專家會員組織委員會分任修訂。計機械名詞有一萬一千餘則，　機名詞五千餘，均較初版增多數倍。至於其他工程　詞，亦當陸續編訂出版。</p>
<p>（五）榮譽金牌之贈給</p>
<p>歐美各豐學術團體，對於服務於建設事業之人士，有特殊貢獻者，每有贈給榮譽金牌或獎章之舉，以鼓勵專家爲國家社會諜幸福，用意至善。本會右鑒於此，爰定有贈給榮譽金牌辦法，於工程界中，每年擇其確有特別貢獻者　不限於會員）一人，贈以金牌，以資鼓勵。本年得金牌者爲化學工程專家侯德榜君。</p>
<p>（六）雜誌週刋之發行</p>
<p>世界工程學術日在進步之中，當此吾國正在努力建設時期，工程界同人尤宜交換智識經騐，以收攻錯之效。本會本此宗旨，發行刊物兩種，一爲「工程雜誌」，每兩月出版一次，以發表長篇論著爲主，一爲「工程週刋」，每星期出版一次，以刊載國內各處之建設消息爲主。</p>
<p>（七）專門人才之介紹</p>
<p>吾國建設事業，日見推廣，工程人才亦較昔加多。然謀事者與徵求者聲氣每不相通，致用非所長，或聘非其人奢，在所不免。本會有鑒於此，爰有職業介紹委員會之設，專爲各界物色專門人才，以期人事相稱，供求適合。</p>

<h3 id="c274">上海市體育場工程概要 <a href="#c274" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e274" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">274</a></h3>
<p>（一）緣起上海市政府鑒於市內人口，已達三百萬以上，而大規模之體育塲，尚付缺如，殊不足以應市民鍜鍊體魄與業餘娛樂之需要，復以市中心區域成立伊始，必須有種種設施，以新市民之觀戚，而促進該區之繁榮，愛籌於此建設市體育塲，謀一舉而兩得。民國二十三年初，及由市中心區域建設委員會建築師辦事處着手設計。同年七日，市政府呈准中央發行公債三百五十萬元，並指定以一百萬元爲建築市體育塲之用。此建設上海市體育塲籌備經過情形之大略也。</p>
<p>（二）置位市體育塲旣須具相當規模，故所佔地面須在千公畝以上。爲免微收民地及撙節經費起見，爰以市中心區域行政區西南第一公園之一部份，爲該塲之建築地址（第一圖中「5」）。該處東面國和路，西通淞滬路，北接政同路，南界虬江，其南有淞滬，翔殷，其美，黃興，四幹道之交叉點，北有將來淞滬鐵路通至三民路淞滬路口之車站，故往來交通稱便。</p>
<p>（三）計劃概要市體育塲包括目前設置之運動塲，體育館，游泳池三部，及將來加建之網球塲，棒球塲兩部（第二圖），佔地約三百畝，茲述其設計要點如次：</p>
<p>（甲）運動塲運動塲（第二圖中「　」）除供市民日常鍜鍊體魄外，並備舉行學校聯合運動會，全國運動會，遠東運動會乃至世界運動會之用。其建築形式及各項尺寸大都視田徑賽及足球，籃球，網球等競賽之需要而定。塲址不取U字形及圓形而作鏈鐶形（第四圖）者，以作如U字形，則正門勢須設於凸出之一端，而對向交通上次要之政同路，殊覺不妥，又如作圓形，則徑賽上需要二百公尺長之直綫跑道，無法設置也。其他設計要點，亦經參考歐美著名運動塲之佈置，審愼擬定。</p>
<p>本塲連看臺所佔之地位，總寬一百七十五公尺（五百七十四呎），總長二百三十公尺（一千零八十二呎）。塲屋最高點距地面約二十公尺（六十六呎）看臺圍牆約十公尺（三十二呎）。塲地面積約二萬七千五百平方公尺（四十萬零四千方呎）。中央爲足球塲，排球塲及跳高，姚遠，擲鐵餅，國術等塲地，圍以環跑道，長約五百公尺。環跑道又於東西兩邊分歧爲直跑道，各長二百公尺。跑道外南北兩端設網球塲，籃球塲各三處。看臺周圍長約七百六十公尺（二千五百呎），寬約十七公尺（五十五呎），可坐四萬人，立二萬人。其容量較南京運動塲大約一倍。</p>
<p>爲使數萬觀衆出入迅捷有序起見，設交通路綫兩種：（甲）環繞交通路綫，計分兩條：一設於收票地點之外，卽環繞看臺下之過道（第四圖）及塲外四周之人行道與車馬道（寬九公尺），另一設於塲內，卽看臺上一·八公尺寬之環繞通路。（乙）上下交通路綫，聯絡環繞交通路綫與看臺座位之間，卽看臺谷段間之出入門道，下通看臺下之過道，上達各座位邊者。此項門道，共設二十四處，勻佈全塲，每處以通行一千二百人計，數萬觀衆，至多於五分鐘內，卽可全數退出。每門道口設鐵質拉門，以便觀衆擁擠時，收票員易於維持秩序。</p>
<p>在本塲之東西長邊中央，各設壯麗之大門，以便運動員整隊出入，車輛亦可由此通過直達塲內。</p>
<p>爲使觀衆視綫得由看臺遍及塲地各部起見，看臺支承座位之樓板。係按曲綫佈置，其坡度自下往上繼續加激。構造之法，係將每段樓級較下段各增高六公釐（四分之一吋）。前後座位之距離計七十一公分（二十八時），故每一座位所佔面積爲四十五公分（十八吋）寬，七十公分（二十八吋）深。按照前述容量，應設座位二十排。</p>
<p>運動塲備有充分宿所，足容納運動員二千五百人，以應舉行大運動會時之需要。又設壯麗之大門與大廳休息辦公室，陳列室，訪事處，無綫電播音站，餐室等。其佈置之完備，卽全世運動塲中亦鮮有較勝者。</p>
<p>特別看臺凡兩處，東西遙遙相對，專備特別觀客及報館記者之座位。本塲看臺以經濟關係，概不設置木椅，惟在西面平頂下之特別看臺爲例外。</p>
<p>另一特別之點，爲利用看臺下地位設置店房，公厠，售票房（第四圖）。其四周之過道，除輔助此項店房遮蔽風日外，又足資暴雨時觀衆引避之需。按照現定計劃，看臺下地位僅利用一半，其餘一半則留備他日加建店房等之用。</p>
<p>運動塲用鋼筋混凝土作架，用紅磚砌墻，而以人造石爲外墻之勒脚及壓頂。東西大門採用中國形式，以人造石砌成。其餘構造頗屬簡單。</p>
<p>運動塲備有多數旗桿，於舉行運動會時頗關重要。塲地及塲屋正面設泛射燈。</p>
<p>本塲之立面及剖面見第五及第六圖。</p>
<p>（乙）體育館本館（第二圖中「2」）除應市民各項戶內運勁之需要外，兼供集會之用，並可舉行展覽會及演劇。</p>
<p>容量爲座位三千五百及立位一千五百。必要時可加設臨時座位於運動廳四周沿墻之處。運動廳設於館屋之中央，地面用戚木鋪蓋。寬約二十三公尺（六十三呎）長約四十公尺（一百三十一呎），可排設普通籃球塲三處，爲正式比賽計，可置較大之塲位於中央，而於四邊多留餘地（第八圖）。館屋　總寬約四十六公尺（一百五十呎）長約八十二公尺（二百七十呎）。運動廳四週之看臺支於堅固之鋼筋混凝土樑及磚墻。寬約十一公尺（三十六呎），凡十三級，每級寬六十六公分（二十六吋），高三十六公分（十四時）至四十一公分（十六吋）。設計時假定之活儎爲每平方公尺六百一十公斤（每方呎一百二十五磅）連同靜儎每平方公尺一百二十公斤（每方呎二十五磅），總儎重爲每平方公尺七百三十公斤。</p>
<p>正門內大廳兩旁，各設階級一座，觀衆由此直達看臺。館屋後面兩邊，各設旁門及較狹階級，以便觀衆由此出館</p>
<p>館屋之正面（第九圖）牆垣用人造石地砌成，其形式含現代藝術色彩，而參以本國之　案裝飾，於此開拱門三座，即館屋之正門。其餘外　用紅磗砌築，而壓頂及勒脚鑲以人造石塊。</p>
<p>自正門入內，爲門廳，兩旁設售票房，再進爲大廳，兩旁設男女厠所及前述通看臺之階級。再進爲穿堂，直通運動廳（籃球塲）及後面之健身房，旁達辦公室及會客室，又由兩邊各另經一門（第八圖中「丁」），分別達男女運動員之更衣，淋浴，等室，由此可通運動廳，健身房及運動器儲藏室。健身房兩旁設廚房及鍋爐間以及前述旁門之門廳與階級。</p>
<p>館屋之前後墻，高出平臺以上者，上邊成圓弧形，最高點高二十公尺（六十六呎），兩邊外墻高約十二公尺（三十九呎六吋）。屋項架前後排列，相距各六公尺七公寸（二十二呎），爲三樞紐式鋼鐵拱形構架（第十圖），其跨度（卽兩端樞紐點之距離）計四十二公尺七公寸（一百四十呎），矢度（卽中央樞紐點與兩端樞紐點之垂直距離）計十九公尺半（六十四呎），上弦之曲綫半徑爲三十公尺（九十九呎）。邊部垂桿之高度，自兩端樞紐點起，計約十二公尺半（四十一呎）。</p>
<p>運動廳及健身房之採光，取高射式，以免運動員感眩目之弊。故於穹頂設固定排窗十孔，兩邊外牆高出看臺處開八角小窗各十六孔，又於前後墻高出平臺處設長方形窗各五孔。後兩種窗扇可以開啟，以使空氣流通。至於電燈，則裝於鋼鐵屋頂架之下。</p>
<p>館屋內之熱氣設備，採低壓式，熱氣冷凝之水，藉自動唧筒還入汽鍋。運動廳與健身房藉摩托通風機散佈暖氣，其他部分則直接利用熱之輻射作用以取暖。</p>
<p>（丙）游泳池本游泳池（第二圖中「　」）之設，以供市民水上運動及舉行游泳競賽爲目的，池爲露天式，四周圍以看臺，可客座五千。看臺下設更衣室，淋浴室，休息室，店房，公厠，鍋爐間，濾水機間等。看臺之北邊設宏麗之正門，門內設辦公室，客廳，大廳，售票房等。看臺下沿東，西，南三面建走廊通道，以瞧觀衆避雨之需（第十二圖）。關於游泳池之尺寸，按照美國大學游泳競賽規例，池面至少應爲長十八公尺（六十呎），寬六公尺（二十呎），池之深度在較淺之一端至少應爲九公寸（三呎），在較深一端至少應爲一公尺半（五呎）。本池之尺寸，經與本市體臺界商酌，擬定計長五十公尺，寬二十公尺；池底於長邊方向作匙形，由一端深約一公尺一公寸（三呎半）起，向中央漸漸加深至一公尺七公寸（五呎半），然後由中央至距他端五公尺（十六呎）之處，陡降至三公尺半（十一呎半）之深度。（此項深度，爲遠東運動會所採用者）。</p>
<p>池身用鋼筋混凝土及防水材料構造，以足以抗禦池滿時之「水壓」及池空時之「土壓」爲度。池底打樁七百二十五根爲基。池底及池邊　白色攳賽克，四壁砌白磁磗。</p>
<p>本池之容量約爲二千二百立方公尺（六十萬加侖）。此項鉅大水最，若時時更換，所費勢必不資，且每次更換須閱十小時，亦殊不便。爰置濾水設備，使濁水出池復變爲淸，再返入池，循環不已。計每次循環，凡五階段，卽：（一）消毒，（二）濾淸，（三）入池，（四）流通，（五）出池，此項濾淸工作，可於游泳季節內繼續不停。每經過一次消毒與濾淸，水質益形潔淨。</p>
<p>池內燈光設備，探最新式，卽於水面下池壁內置强光燈泡，使燈光水色打成一片，而成整個「光源」，於夜間觀之，至爲悅目賞心。反之，若以燈光下照池內，則因水面之反射作用，池外雖極明亮，徒眩游泳者之目，水內則顯幽暗，足滋發生意外時救護之困難。故燈光設於池內水面以下之辦法，有便利游泳與救護兩優點，當今夏夜游泳　成風習之際，殊有採用之必要。本池及附屬建築物之設計，固以實用爲旨歸，而對於美觀一點亦經加以注意，大門牆垣用人造石塊砌成，上加雕刻，顯示本國文化色彩（第十三圖）。其餘牆垣用紅磚砌築，而以人造石爲勒脚及壓項，以資經濟。就本池全部建築觀之，所有建築形式與運動塲及體育館互相適應。</p>
<p>査歐美各國之游泳池，往往附帶小池，深度在一公尺二公寸以下，專供兒童游泳之用。本池以限於經費預算之故，未能兼顧此項設備，殊屬缺憾。</p>
<p>（丁）網球塲及棒球塲體育塲之中部及西北角，擬建網球塲（設球塲三處及座位四千之看臺等）及棒球塲（附座位四千之看臺）各一處（第二圖中「4」及「5」），留待將來興工，不在此次舉辦工程之範圍內。</p>
<p>（四）施工運動塲，體育館及游泳池之建築圖案，經市中心區域建設委員會建築師董大酉君及助理建築師王華彬君主持設計完成，並呈奉市政府核准後，卽於二十三年七月由工務局招標。投標人十一家中，由成泰以最廉標價得標承辦。旋於八月間開工，於十月一日舉行奠基典禮，預定於二十四年五月落成。</p>
<p>（五）餘言本工程設計上不乏新頴之點，如關於鋼筋混凝土屋架，出入交通路綫宿舍佈置，看臺下店房等設備以及內外裝璜等，在在足供本國其他各處設計體育塲者之參考。而以本塲規模之大，容量之多，佈置之完備，乃能以百萬元左右之經費完成之，尤見設計者之苦心孤詣焉！</p>

<p>— 影呆</p>
<p>我們知道，所謂建築材料展覽會，在歐美各國，時常有得舉行的，舉行建集材料展覽的目的，一方在促建築材料的進步，另一面推銷國產建築材料，現模大一些，更可擴大到建築工程的研討，原有很大的意義，是不可忽略的！</p>
<p>在二十世紀的時代中，建築材料太落後的中國，近幾年來，在上海的都市之中，也曾有過幾次建築材料展覽的舉行，但這種展覽會，舉行的結果，參觀的人每是少得很，遠沒有美術展覽，攝影展覽的熱鬧。就這一點，我們便可看出國人對於建築材料的觀念遝是非常淡薄。</p>
<p>其實所謂建築材料，的確，是不容我們忽視的，尤其是在此不景氣聲中，整個中國的經濟危機，爲了入超的逐年增加，日見深刻化起來。說來非常可憐，日前中國的建築材料，大半仰給於外貨每年建材料得進口，數字方面，也是很足驚人，祗是國人對於建築方面，不注意的居多，每是忽略到這筆漏巵而已</p>
<p>這次工程師恊會舉行地產材料建築展覽，其目的無非在促使國人注意到國產建築材料已進步到怎樣一個程度那幾種建築材料我們的國貨出品已是很好，不必仰求外商的供給了；而且這又是一個難得的機會，恰巧和全國運動會同時開慕無疑的這次的展覽，參觀的人一定可比前幾次展覽爲多，而結果可引起國人對於建築材料有相當的注意。</p>
<p>在建築材料商人本身方面，正可因了這次的展覽，大家能够注意到自己的出品，成績如何？缺點何如？作進一步的研究能夠　意德改進，使國產的建築材料，價廉物美，足以奪得外貨的市場上海市行政區烏瞰圖董大酉建築師設計，免去中國的一筆鉅大金錢流出。同時，在參觀的人，更應熱心的提倡國產建築材料，此後應用此項材料，凡是有國貨出品的决不採用外貨。能够這樣，國產建築材料的前途，自有無限的發展可知這次的展覽，自有莫大的意義！</p>
<p>我們最小的希望：在求這次的展覽，能引起社會對於建築材料的注意，更能促使國產建築材料的長足進步呢！</p>

<p>（日內瓦）國聯大會昨日在緊張之空氣中開會考慮對意制裁問題、各會員曾發生異見、主席皮尼士博士發言說明召集此會之主旨後、奧匈、代表卽宣布其本國政府拒絕參加任何制裁致全塲爲之大譁、奧代表浦魯格爾起稱、奧政府願重行聲明其對國聯原則之忠貞與恪守、但其地位實不能贊同行政院其他理事之决議、意國曾在困苦狀况中竭力輔助奧國之獨立、故嘗表深切之同情於奧人、奧國不能不答報此種友誼云、匈代表維列樞繼起宣稱、匈國不能贊同對恒與匈人友好相處之國家實施制裁之决議、匈國關於經濟制裁、處於不幸之地位、蓋停止各項對意之輸出、將引起經濟風潮與嚴重之財政恐慌也、</p>
<p>大會會衆覩此發展、膛目相視、無一代表續起發言、於是主席乃宣布延會至今日、屆時意總代表阿洛鍚等將發表對行政院决議之意見、</p>
<p>昨日之會議、與會者甚衆、旁聽席中、無一虛座、主席皮尼士起述大會本定於一星期前休會、而所以决計延長會期之原因、渠此次召集大會之動因有二、（一）因戰事之發展、大局有嚴重之轉變、（二）行政院已臻需大會合作之地步、皮士繼追述大會上屆延會後大局之發展、並報吿行政院已通過六人委員會議决阿比西尼亞戰事之發作、實爲意國已弁髦國聯盟約訴諸武力之明證之報吿書、於是宣讀行政院主席紀那佐來文、文內引述一九二一年十月四日大會决議案、謂根據盟約明白之條文、現需各會員履行第十六條規定之任務、凡漠視此項任務者、實不能避免破壞條約義務云、職是之故、大會乃正式决議將此事列入議程、俾得立卽討論爭案、主席爲消除誤會起見、聲明主席團已决定</p>

<p>（羅馬）記者以奧匃兩國拒絕參加對意制裁消息、就詢外部發言人、據答稱、「道路猶通也」云、但此間公正之觀察者咸信、屋期四日五十國通過之制裁計畫不久將迫墨索里尼首相求和、此種觀察根據之理由有二、（一）國聯計畫共同抵制意國之貨物、將斷絕意國外匯之供給、使其無法購買德奧匃三國之貨物、（二）國聯會員國斷絕主要軍火原料如媒油及鎳之供給輕而易舉、日內瓦各國代表雖不抱德國參加制裁之希望、但表示奧匃兩國之宣言並不如彼等宣傳之重要、鑒於國聯制裁卽在目前、意國發言人重申意國願意談判和平、殊堪重視、（九日國民電）</p>
<p>海牙　荷蘭國會今日通過一案、授權政府管理出口貨物、藉此促進和平、該案與美國國會通過之中立法相似、政府自此有權下令禁止軍火運往交戰國、惟有一點更較美國計劃澈底、卽該計劃不但禁止軍火之出口、且將禁止軍火原料也、（九日國民電）</p>

<p>下午一時、處女作由靑　河北剪帶、上塲伊始、河北王大純先發制人、發球成績不錯、靑島雖未喪重寨、但頭路陣綫、却已大亂、故不十分鐘、已見參差甚遠、靑島姜希聖發球、略有所得、但換塲時仍爲十一比四之大錯、泊後靑島排振作精神、呼應後方、不作倖勝之追求、而嚴守門禁、一試果然靈騐、惟以上半局形勢大惡、卒以廿一對十七終局、第二局始　　島再變戰略、中　急攻、後排取守、形勢似稍入佳境、　賢亮　、頓如餓虎撲犬、河北陳裏、修　不足、竟爲一局之勝、即有把握、於是大意失去荊州、以十五比二十一、六分之差、造成各一局面、第三局上塲、靑島與河北同犯幼稚毛病、一對帶拉蘇、此得彼失、各有巧合、仍以十五對二十一還邊河北、四塲爲生死關鍵、戰來自必上動、惟雙方同　烏合之帥、　拚個你死我活、亦不過從的械鬬局面、故精彩甚少、結果二十一對十、河北　靑島、　比數　　、裁判員俞杰、連容如下、</p>
<p>（三）福建勝湖南</p>
<p>三時、福建對湖南上　、裁判員陳德、心急火　、嗚金開火、福建發球中的、湖南林元伯還過顏色、從此旅進旅退、各不相讓、但福建究屬此道老將、過門十足、霎時乘機深人、湖南以初生之犢、亦不放鬆、故上半塲僅十一對九些微之差、換塲後、天色放霽、陽光適耀射湖南、眼花瞭亂、湖南吃虧不少、第一局二十一比十一福建勝、第二局、福建再事壓迫、湘軍非當年時代、在侵略之下、毫無反抗二十一對十二、已頗費事、第三局、輪至林仁心發球、一起呵成、連得七分、湖南老將、非但不能反抗、即掙扎亦不易出手、於是整個江山、供手讓人、比數爲二十一對六、</p>

<p>男子網球開幕賽計有單打、昨日共有兩組、同時於下午一時啟賽、結果香港徐煉培何家鎏、各以二比〇擊敗山西趙天福趙雲生、而得次賽權、何爲網球宿將、擊法穩健、徐爲香港名手、去歲曾一度挫許承基，上屆全運、鋒芒甚健、最近於表演賽中、又勝林望蘇、二趙球藝、差强人意、惟經騐不足、不得不甘拜下風、茲將結果列後、</p>

<p>男子雙打比賽、於下午三時開始、按照秩字、本有二組比賽、惟河南晨曾報名參加、但無選手蒞會、威海衛僅有代表一人、故均棄權、因此馬來亞與爪哇、皆不勞而獲次賽權、而來瞻仰爪哇靑年網球家許承基之數百觀衆、亦廢然而返、如期比賽、僅有湖南對安徽一組、湖南由凌志揚李世康代表、安徽由朱　吳張鳴琴出戰、雙方技術平平、無足可述、惟實力尚稱平均、故競賽三盤、方分勝負、結果如左、</p>

<p>上海第一單打林寶、近因身體違和、恐不能出席比賽、若誠事實、則上海對於網球錦標、史暗　無光、因本屆網球秩序、集各單位最强之單打駡手於一起、較弱者又集於一起、若第一單打選手不能出席、由第二單打選手遞袖之、其餘亦依次遞補、名次一經决定、不得更動、第一單打　　中、港徐煉培於次賽中郎遇爪哇之許承基、而四川王文正於半複賽中逢許、其勢必爲淘汰、上海之强敵、已失大半、直至半複賽時、方與林　　相遇、故極有獲得複賽權之可能、在第二單　　團中、如上海以邱飛海充任代表、可達决賽、如是雖單打冠軍無望、而第二三兩名、希望甚濃、雙打若能獲勝、則網球錦標、仍可保持、否則邱任第一單打、縱能獲得複賽權、而繼邱無人、第二單打集團中、必爲馬來亞之陳其安、或爪哇之曾端才得决賽權、如是邱至多得第二、且林不出席、雙打之希望已絕、上海贊標無望矣、林究竟出塲與否、今日便見分曉、</p>

<p>前日大會競賽委員會第二次會議之結果、議决一重要之原則、已誌昨報、關於凡參加兩單位之選手、須取消其參加本屆比賽之資格、聞競賽委員會已發覺湖北省跳高代表吳必顯、曾參加雨地預選、吳黨時參加河北省預選、以某種關係未曾錄取、後吳又向湖北省報名、得以代表湖北省出席、今競賽委員會昨已致函湖北省總領隊、請其停止參加、但吳於接到通知前、已得跳高冠軍、故如何解决、尚不可知、</p>

<p>丙，裁判標準</p>
<p>以上男女兩組之拳術單人比賽、又名為表演賽、裁判員對於各男女選手之裁判標準、分（一）姿式、（二）動作、（三）運動三項、加以公正之紀分、再以三項總分用十五除之、所得之數即為個人分數、昨日預賽男女各取十二名、待決賽時、再由十二人中各選取六名、作為最後之優勝者、</p>
<p>裁判長表示欣慰</p>
<p>國術比賽組裁判長褚民誼、當拳術單人比賽時對記者稱、本屆全國運動會中者有三十八個單位、而參加國術比賽者僅十八個單位、所以不能如參加其他各項比賽之踴躍、一則各省尚有許多未成立國術館、二則因無國術館之設立、故對於國術選手亦較為難選、但是此次凡未參加之單位、均另行派員到會參觀、以資下屆大會之參考、本人認為好現象、又此次國術比賽、共計七項、其中拳術器械二項各為表演比賽、所謂對比者、并非甲與乙兩單位、乃係本單位自己與自己比賽、此外均稱為比賽、又本人對於國術一項、所以提倡不遣餘力者、乃在求國術之普遍也、以今日觀察之結果、男子拳術、固多精彩、而女子拳術進步、尤極迅速、殊覺欣慰也、</p>

<p>彪形大漢話旗手</p>
<p>各單位之旗手、均身高六尺以上之彪形大漢充任之、　以分選手二人左右扶持、大有英雄美人之概、旗手中最惹人注目者、一為浙江隊之著名長人張錫祜、一為上海隊之章哥也、此二人身坯之高大、視各單位旗手中、均無出其右、香滿旗手為美男子陳振興充任、美人魚楊秀瓊及乃姊秀珍則分侍左右、紅花綠葉、亦頗耐人尋味也、</p>
<p>北平選手胖子多</p>
<p>北平選手隊中、胖子特別多、有幾個像惠泉山大阿福、有幾個則活像出域隍會中之劊子手、搖搖擺擺、令人噴飯、如果用磅秤秤起來、起碼要超過二百五十斤、眞要點吃勿消、</p>
<p>蒙選手牛山濯濯</p>
<p>各單位中、為人所矚目者、厥為邊陲各省之選手、不憚跋涉、遠道參加、精神至為可貴、而蒙古選手之一律光頭、牛山濯濯、觀眾不約而同的哈哈大笑起來、風頭之健、山西光頭、不得專美於前矣、</p>

<h3 id="e1">Activities Behind the Scenes in Geneva: League of Nations Sanctions Steps; Differing Urgency Between Britain and France; Undecided Attitudes of Poland, Austria, Hungary, and Switzerland; Issues Also Arise with the US, Germany, and Japan; Disputes Arise over the Interpretation of Article 16 <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations General Assembly, originally scheduled to convene at 5 PM today to consider the resolution of the Administrative Council condemning Italy, has been postponed to 6 PM (2 AM on the 10th, Shanghai time). It is said that this is due to differences of opinion between Britain and France regarding sanctions. The Bureau meeting, originally scheduled for 4 PM, is expected to be moved forward by one hour. It is reported that the French representative's opinion is that sanctions should be gradually implemented within the limits of economic sanctions. The British representative, on the other hand, advocates that sanctions should progress from purely economic sanctions to more severe plans. As for economic sanctions, they should be implemented entirely and immediately, without being divided into stages. Representatives of the British Dominions held a meeting this morning, and British Minister Without Portfolio Eden attended the meeting to explain the British government's attitude. Rumors that Britain's attitude is weakening are completely unfounded. Britain's actions have always been focused on avoiding ineffective or delayed actions and have never deviated from this position. The past two days have seen much activity behind the scenes here, in order to arrange the League of Nations' business as quickly as possible. It seems that the revocation of the ban on arms exports to Abyssinia will be among the first issues discussed at today's General Assembly meeting. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations General Assembly discussion will take at least two days to complete. During this period, member states will exchange opinions in order to establish a special committee to adjust the sanction measures decided by the League of Nations General Assembly. In addition, non-League of Nations members, such as the United States, Japan, and Germany, will also be consulted. While each member state has the freedom to decide on economic and financial sanctions, where countries should act in concert, the League of Nations will make all preparations to ensure mutual coordination. Therefore, the General Assembly will have an adjustment committee, which will continue to meet until the end of the Italo-Abyssinian War. As for the implementation of sanctions, it will start with economic aspects. The first step is to restrict the export of various war necessities. War necessities are divided into two categories. The initial restriction is on the export of firearms and ammunition, followed by the export of various key products used in the arms industry. After the first step is completed, the import of Italian goods will be further restricted. Subsequently, the adjustment committee can also prohibit the export of various minor items, such as tea, sugar, and coffee, in order to exert pressure on the civilians of the aggressor country. (Havas, 8th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) A dispute has now arisen over the implementation of sanctions. Some jurists believe that the automatic implementation of sanctions as stipulated in Article 16 of the League of Nations Covenant has been canceled by the resolution of the League of Nations General Assembly in 1921. Therefore, a unanimous vote of the General Assembly is now required to obligate member states to jointly implement sanctions. If unanimous agreement from the General Assembly is a prerequisite, the implementation of sanctions will become even more difficult.</p>
<p>Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck arrived here by plane yesterday, and his visit has attracted much attention. It is rumored that Beck may present some reservations regarding Poland's attitude, and it is also said that Beck's arrival here was at the earnest request of the Italian envoy to Poland.</p>
<p>The attitudes of Austria, Hungary, and Switzerland are also undecided, as these three countries rely on trade with Italy, and participation in any form of sanctions would pose many difficulties. If the General Assembly decides to implement sanctions, the committee assisting in this effort will be composed of some council members of the Administrative Council, representatives from countries bordering Italy, and representatives from two or three countries with commercial relations with Italy. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) League of Nations representatives predict today that sanctions against Italy will be implemented within the next week. A committee will now be presumed, consisting of six countries neighboring Italy: Greece, Yugoslavia, Austria, Switzerland, France, and Spain, to propose sanction implementation methods. Associated Press reporters interviewed representatives from various countries. It is said that whether member states are willing to implement sanctions will be chosen by each country and based on whether they are willing to offend Mussolini. It is judged that the implementation of sanctions will be the final test of the League of Nations' power. Countries implementing sanctions will cut off financial, commercial, and personal relations between the covenant-breaking country and member and non-member countries. If sanctions are to be carried out thoroughly, they will affect non-member countries such as the United States, Japan, and Germany. Most representatives here favor first not purchasing Italian goods, thereby depriving Italy of foreign exchange, making it unable to purchase raw materials, and believe that President Roosevelt's proclamation of neutrality has already become a powerful sanction against Italy. (National Telegram, 8th)</p>
<p>(Washington) The general impression here is that the United States may not cooperate with the League of Nations in implementing sanctions or sending observers to the League of Nations committee handling sanctions. However, the United States does not oppose sanctions and will recognize any effective blockade and will not insist on the rights of American merchants to trade with Italy. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Well-informed sources predict that Japan, having withdrawn from the League of Nations on March 27, 1933, will refuse any form of sanctions against Italy. It is said that Japan has decided to remain distant from the League of Nations and observe developments from the sidelines. However, the Japanese government will abide by the words in the Imperial Rescript of March 27, 1933, supporting the promotion of international peace. Furthermore, Japan, having repeatedly declared its special position as an element of stability in East Asia, is particularly unwilling to pursue policies that would seem to increase struggles elsewhere in the world, thus causing self-contradictory protection. Therefore, while Japan is willing to maintain economic and commercial relations with Italy, it must, out of respect for the Rescript, humanity, and morality, oppose supplying Italy with war goods. Japan's implementation of actions that converge with the League of Nations' policies is unlikely to cause domestic opposition. Because Italy is engaged in military operations in East Africa, it has no time to engage in business, and Japan's exports, especially natural silk and rayon, will inevitably flourish.

<h3 id="e2">League of Nations General Assembly Bureau Accepts the Administrative Council's Proposal, Preparing to Submit it to the General Assembly for a Vote, to Implement Article 16 of the Covenant <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Secretariat met at 3 PM today to decide on the procedures to be adopted at today's League of Nations General Assembly meeting. The Secretariat approved a general discussion of the report of the League of Nations Administrative Council, announced by the President of the Administrative Council, which condemned Italy. The President of the General Assembly, Piniès, will then read a document, and the Italian representative, Aloisi, will follow with a speech opposing the League of Nations' procedures. Then the President of the Administrative Council will read the report of the Six-Nation Committee and notify all members that if they do not speak to express their opinions, they will be deemed to have approved the report and agreed to assist other members in implementing the provisions of Article 16 of the Covenant. If a member opposes the report or does not wish to vote, they must state their reasons. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) According to news this afternoon, the League of Nations General Assembly meeting will try to conclude tonight or tomorrow morning, as many speakers will no longer speak, and President Piniès, the Czech Foreign Minister, will read a document instead. The Italian representative, Aloisi, will speak to protest the League of Nations' procedures, accusing them of abusing procedural rules. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<h3 id="e3">Rome Indicates No Fear of Sanctions; Only a Faint Voice of Peace; Military Plans Proceed as Usual <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>(Rome) A Foreign Ministry spokesman stated today that even if the League of Nations imposes economic and financial sanctions on Italy, Italy will probably not withdraw from the League of Nations. However, Italy's final decision will be based on the method of implementing sanctions. The general interpretation of this statement is that if there is a naval blockade, Italy will withdraw from the League, but if the sanctions are more moderate, they can be tolerated. The spokesman also said that Italy is ready to consider new proposals at any time, which is also noteworthy. (National Telegram, 8th)</p>
<p>(Rome) Today's Italian newspaper, "Il Popolo d'Italia", considered the government mouthpiece, published an article by Gaeda, stating that while Italy is prepared to withdraw from the League of Nations when it decides to implement sanctions, Mussolini is still willing to negotiate directly with Britain and France on the Abyssinian issue based on the 1906 treaty. The prejudiced assumption that Italy's actions will tend towards diplomacy after occupying Adowa is actually not understanding the main reason for Italy's actions, which is not for the sake of honor and national prestige, but because of Abyssinia's repeated unprovoked aggression. The occupation of Adowa and other key points by Italian troops is purely a local matter. The actions of Italian troops on all fronts will continue according to the objectives and needs of the Abyssinian threat. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<p>(Rome) A Foreign Ministry spokesman said today regarding the League of Nations sanctions that they would not be very effective, and further stated that Italy intends to purchase the goods it needs from friendly countries and intends to raise funds domestically to pay for them. Therefore, economic sanctions will have no impact on Italy. (National Telegram, 8th)</p>
<h3 id="e4">British Cabinet Drafts Sanctions Proposals <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>(London) Government experts have today begun drafting proposals for economic sanctions against Italy, which will be submitted to the League of Nations for approval. (Military and Civilian Telegram, 8th)</p>
<p>(London) The Cabinet will meet tomorrow to discuss the proposals for implementing sanctions submitted by the British delegation in Geneva. It is reported that the British proposals are divided into four categories: (1) Prohibiting the import of Italian goods. This measure is particularly effective because Italy's exports to League of Nations member states account for 70% of its total exports. (2) Prohibiting loans to Italy. (3) Prohibiting the export of certain raw materials to Italy. (4) Revoking the ban on the transport of arms to Abyssinia. As for severing diplomatic relations with Italy, it has not yet been considered, and general opinion is largely against it, as it is believed that if diplomatic relations are severed, it will no longer be possible to negotiate with Italy to end the war. (Havas, 8th)</p>
<p>(London) The British Cabinet met today for two hours to consider the situation arising from the outbreak of war between Italy and Abyssinia and agreed on several temporary measures, following the plans adopted by the League of Nations in Geneva. It is expected that the new leader of the Labour Party, Attlee, will meet with Prime Minister Baldwin today. The government will notify Attlee after the League of Nations announces its resolution on sanctions. After the League of Nations makes this announcement, Britain will convene Parliament to discuss important matters. It is believed that Parliament will reconvene around October 21. (Reuters, 9th)</p>

<p>(London) Foreign Secretary Sir Samuel Hoare met with US Ambassador Bingham last night. It is generally believed that President Roosevelt recently made a declaration explaining the US attitude towards the Italo-Abyssinian conflict. Bingham's meeting with Hoare was to provide a clear explanation of the meaning of this declaration. However, it seems that naval issues were not mentioned. (Havas, 9th)</p>

<h3 id="e8">Abyssinian King Firmly Declares, Vows Not to Succumb to Italy; Has Achieved a Moral Victory in the League of Nations; Loss of Two Cities Irrelevant to Overall Victory or Defeat <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>Abyssinian Capital: The Abyssinian Emperor said in an interview with our reporter yesterday, "Since Italy's act of aggression has been judged by the League of Nations Administrative Council, our country has obtained justice, and morally, our country has received the reward it deserves. Our country had no intention of war in the past, nor does it now. However, as Abyssinian territory has now been invaded by Italy, it is our duty to defend it. We did not start the war, but we will never succumb to armed aggression provoked by others. Moreover, when the Paris Three-Nation Conference between Britain, France, and Italy consulted our country in September, we promised to accept all concessions that did not hinder our national dignity. Our intention in enduring humiliation and bearing heavy burdens was originally to avoid Italian aggression, but unexpectedly, the act of aggression was still irreversible. Subsequently, our country also accepted the recommendations put forward by the Five-Nation Subcommittee of the League of Nations Administrative Council. Our country is willing to cooperate with countries with good intentions, which is another proof." (Havas, 9th)</p>
<p>Abyssinian Capital: People here believe that the loss of the two cities of Adowa and Aksum in the northern frontier is merely a minor skirmish by the vanguard and has little to do with the outcome of the war. The authorities still say that the war has just begun and are very confident in the Abyssinian army's prospects for victory. It is rumored that Abyssinia's famous suicide squad, with 300 men in each team, has invaded Italian Eritrea and is only 66 kilometers away from the seat of the Italian colonial government. It is also reported that Abyssinian General Gasa has led 88,000 troops along the Eritrean border to resist the Italian right wing. Contact between the two sides' regular troops will begin there. General Seysum, the Governor of Tigre Province, has telegraphed the Abyssinian Emperor, saying that he has captured an Italian colonel and 30 other officers. The Abyssinian Emperor is scheduled to go to the front on the 12th of this month to lead the expedition. The Abyssinian Crown Prince has also led two columns to the Adowa front.

Their intention seemed to be to reconnoiter the road from Taixi City to the northern front, to see if Abyssinia was sending reinforcements from that city. In view of the various false reports that have been widely spread in recent days, the Abyssinian government has ordered the military authorities to implement news censorship and has also issued a proclamation ordering the people not to easily believe rumors.

<h3 id="e15">This Year's Double Tenth Festival <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>— Du</p>
<p>The Double Tenth Festival is the anniversary of the birth of the Republic of China. It is also the day when the Chinese nation succeeded in developing its free will and breaking away from the shackles of autocracy. At that time, the revolutionary martyrs lived under the torment of tyranny, secretly engaging in activities in separate locations, seeking to relieve the people from their suffering. The difficulties and twists and turns were probably hundreds of times greater than we can imagine. They sacrificed their heads and shed their blood, undergoing many heroic sacrifices to achieve this glorious history of success. As we sit facing this solemn and splendid commemorative festival, how can we not feel admiration and respect? However, after reminiscing, we often feel ashamed. The difficulty of the predecessors' creation and the importance of their entrustment, how can we, the successors, bear the responsibility? The Republic has been founded for twenty-four years. Surrounded by enemies on all sides, changes occur frequently, the people's intelligence is not advanced, material resources are scarce, society still follows the old ways, and everything lacks clear progress. What can we rely on to comfort the spirits of the predecessors in the afterlife? This is why we often feel melancholy on this day.</p>
<p>Looking at the environment this year's Double Tenth Festival, although it is still the same as before, there is one thing that can give us excitement: the National Games happened to open today. The meaning of sports, from a partial perspective, is only to train the individual's physique and cultivate a martial spirit. But from a holistic point of view, it is also helpful in changing the demoralized atmosphere and promoting the country's position. Tracing the reasons for China's long-term weakness, there are indeed various factors, and the lack of sports concept is one of the main reasons. In the past, Chinese people were limited by the established view of respecting etiquette and law, and they did not know how to practice their physique. Instead, they took being tough and fierce as a warning. Scholars prided themselves on being weak, and beauties were praised for being sickly. This can be seen in historical records. As a result of this physical weakness, the impact gradually extended to politics, and the situation of following old ways and being decadent was created. On the outside, we could not resist the invasion of the strong, and on the inside, we had no way to renew the situation. Both the court and the people were shrouded in a gloomy atmosphere, and how could there be any talk of rejuvenation? The Qing Dynasty's rapid collapse was also due to its excessive stupidity, which gave our predecessors an opportunity to take advantage of. Now, the National Games are being held in Shanghai, and the whole city is stirred up. The hurried preparations beforehand, the enthusiastic participation of all parties, the eager expectations of the whole country, and the tense atmosphere of the venue all show the Chinese people's increased interest in sports, and no longer the indifference and rejection of the past. Gathering the country's strong and healthy youth to compete in agile and tumbling competitions, the feelings it gives us are extremely beautiful and pleasant. As for the audience who are not sports athletes, there are so many crowded people and such enthusiastic emotions. This phenomenon makes people feel a natural hope for the rise of the nation. We only hope that people across the country will strive to make progress, adapt to the environment, and engage in reasonable sports to improve their physical health and wash away the long-standing bad habits of depression. In addition to saving the national situation from decline, we can also comfort the spirits of the revolutionary martyrs in heaven, and commemorate this brilliant Double Tenth Festival.</p>

<h3 id="e16">Despondency and Composure <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Jingwei</p>
<p>To save China from destruction and ensure its survival today, we must discard the twin habits of clamorous superficiality and despondency. This is something our comrades often say. We will not forget that in Chinese history, during times of crisis and peril, there were many loyal ministers and martyrs who devoted their hearts and strength to salvage the situation. Even if they could not save it at the time, their devoted efforts left behind seeds for future recovery. At the same time, we must not forget that in Chinese history, when facing foreign invasions, many people started with superficial clamor and ended in despondency. The phenomenon of superficial clamor is characterized by failing to assess one's virtues, overestimating one's capabilities, making grand pronouncements, and lacking practical action. The phenomenon of despondency is characterized by the loss of self-confidence, knowing only to live in a state of indolence and complacency. Because of this, the divine land sank, and the Central Plains became ruins. This often happened in Chinese history. How can we get rid of the twin habits of superficial clamor and despondency? Only through composure. The difference between composure and despondency lies not only in maintaining resolve but also in demonstrating it through actions. What is meant by demonstrating it through actions includes, first, constant self-reflection. Only through self-reflection can one self-reproach, and only through self-reproach can one self-salvage. Second, constant comparison with others. Only through comparison can one know the superior and the inferior, and only through knowing the superior and the inferior can one be brave and diligent. The goal of saving the nation from destruction and ensuring its survival cannot be achieved in a day. We must make a firm resolution and accumulate it day by day through continuous efforts. For example, at the end of each year, we should calculate the accumulated results, or at the end of each day, we should calculate the accumulated results. If there is accumulation, it is composure; otherwise, it is despondency. This is the boundary between survival and destruction. Since the responsibility of saving the nation from destruction and ensuring its survival must be accumulated, can time allow us to accumulate? Can space allow us to accumulate? I am afraid that our years of accumulation will not be enough for others to destroy in a moment. This is indeed the most alarming thing. However, strength cannot be built in a day or two. What else can we do besides accumulate? It is a pity that our countrymen have a kind of mentality: in "Investiture of the Gods," if Jiang Ziya has no solution, then it is the Supreme Lord Lao; in "Journey to the West," if Sun Wukong has no solution, then it is the Guanyin Bodhisattva. This mentality invisibly dominates everything, so they regard the word "accumulation" as trivial. However, this kind of delusion will eventually disappear. For the sake of the survival of the country, we can only accumulate; for the sake of personal conscience, we can only accumulate. Mencius said: "Neither premature death nor longevity causes me to have any doubts. I cultivate myself in order to await it; this is how I establish my destiny." The word "await" is dangerous, as the saying goes, "Time waits for no one." However, self-cultivation is something that one can grasp. This is where we find peace of mind and establish our destiny today. (National Day of the Twenty-Fourth Year)</p>
<h3 id="e17">The Significance and Implementation of the National Economic Construction Movement <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>— Chiang Kai-shek</p>
<p>(1) Introduction</p>
<p>The fundamental crisis in China today lies entirely in the devastation of the economy, which has led to the increasing impoverishment of the people's lives, and the fate of the nation is therefore in grave danger and unable to survive in the 20th century. Therefore, the only problem we need to consider in our country at present is how to save this collapsing national economy and enable the people to obtain a decent life, and how to solve the contradictory and shameful phenomenon of goods being abandoned on the ground while the people suffer in the countryside, and to seek the development of the national economy. Therefore, it is believed that there must be a movement today that follows the New Life Movement, namely the National Economic Construction Movement.</p>
<p>(2) The Relationship Between the National Economic Construction Movement and the New Life Movement</p>
<p>The National Economic Construction Movement and the New Life Movement are actually mutually reinforcing. Therefore, they must be carried out in conjunction with each other. The New Life Movement is nationalistic and self-cultivating, focusing on morality and spirit. It is actually the body of the National Economic Construction Movement. The National Economic Construction Movement is for the people's livelihood and production, focusing on action and material aspects. It is actually the application of the New Life Movement. The New Life Movement is to lay the spiritual foundation of the nation, while the National Economic Construction Movement is to enrich the material foundation of the nation. Therefore, the two are indispensable.</p>
<p>(3) Reasons Why a Universal Movement Must Be Promoted for National Economic Construction</p>
<p>Some argue that revitalizing the national economy and relieving the people's livelihood are all inherent duties of national policy, and it is sufficient for the government to work hard to implement them. Why create a separate movement? It is not known that the reason for the exhaustion and depletion of China's national economy is the disconnection between people and things, the disconnection between people and affairs, the disconnection between production factors and production undertakings, and the lack of coordination and connection between various production departments, which is a whole disconnection. Society does not know the importance of production, and industry cannot obtain a good environment to achieve its development. Therefore, to seek the regeneration of China's national economy, we must first awaken the broad masses of self-consciousness, make talents or human resources have an extremely close relationship with natural resources, make various human resources and production factors properly allocated for the whole, and make them effectively utilized in conjunction with the whole people, change all old concepts, and eliminate tangible and intangible obstacles. In particular, we must adjust supply and demand so that production status corresponds to consumption status. In this movement, the government has various undertakings to do, but it is especially necessary to make the people actively participate and become the main force in promoting this movement. On the other hand, this movement is not like other social movements, which can be effective only if people's organizations advocate and lead, or their members abide by the constraints and work hard on their own. Because it often involves national laws and policies, and many matters must rely on the political power of national institutions to promote them, it is also necessary to gather the power of the government, the people, and various public and private groups before they can be fully implemented.</p>
<p>(4) The Meaning of the National Economic Construction Movement</p>
<p>If the meaning of the previous paragraph is clear, then the meaning of this movement is not difficult to understand. The National Economic Construction Movement is to promote the people to automatically improve the national economy, that is, to gather the efforts of all parts of the national society and production institutions to build a sound national economy. The government will use all its strength to remove obstacles and provide various assistance and conveniences. The National Economic Construction Movement aims to build the national economy, that is, to solve the problem of people's livelihood. It has the difference between the scope of national economic policy, which must pay attention to the national economy in addition to the people's livelihood, and the position of the National Economic Construction Movement is the people, and its object is only the people's livelihood. Dr. Sun Yat-sen took the Principle of People's Livelihood as the center of the Three Principles of the People, and the basis of the National Economic Construction Movement to implement the Three Principles of the People is also the preliminary step to realize the Principle of People's Livelihood.</p>
<p>(5) The Goals That the National Economic Construction Movement Should Have</p>
<p>The general goal of this movement is to "exhaust human resources, make the best use of the land, equalize supply and demand, and smooth circulation, in order to seek the sound development of the national economy." It can be further elaborated as follows: In the positive aspect, (a) increase total production to meet the needs of life, (b) increase employment opportunities to solve the problem of unemployment, (c) increase export products to seek trade balance, and (d) ensure investment safety and encourage production activities. In the negative aspect, (a) remove external causes that hinder the development of production (such as donations, industrial regulations, labor-capital relations, etc.), (b) remove internal causes that hinder economic development (such as lack of management methods and talents, etc.), (c) remove obstacles that hinder the circulation of goods (such as transportation, finance, and marketing systems, etc.), and (d) remove psychological factors that hinder production and construction (such as ignorance, superstition, conservatism, lack of labor habits, and disregard for the economy, etc.). (Explanation) The primary task of this movement is to make the best use of people's talents. On the one hand, it enables specialized talents to contribute their abilities to economic construction, and on the other hand, it enables the people with labor force to give full play to their labor force in economic construction. At the same time, it is necessary to cultivate intermediate personnel with practical experience and guidance ability, because we must first make the best use of people's talents before making the best use of the land. This is what our country should not ignore when engaging in national economic construction.</p>
<p>(6) Key Implementation Items of the National Economic Construction Movement</p>
<p>(1) Revitalize agriculture and increase agricultural production. All aspects of fertilizer production, seed selection, improvement of agricultural methods, vigorous agricultural finance, and smooth marketing of agricultural products should be guided and improved on the basis of cooperatives, with the initial goal of achieving self-sufficiency in food. On the one hand, increase the production of industrial raw materials, and at the same time promote the local processing and manufacturing of agricultural products. (2) Encourage land reclamation and animal husbandry, promote large-scale immigration and land reclamation, and operate animal husbandry, implement the military district agricultural reclamation system, use collective labor to develop agricultural profits, restore and increase the production of cattle, sheep, horses, and various rural by-products (such as pigs, fish, chickens, ducks, etc.), and at the same time promote the reclamation and cultivation of all abandoned land in various provinces, with the goal of no abandoned land. (3) Develop mineral resources, investigate the status of the mining industry, and the reasons for destroying and binding the development of the mining industry, advise the government to improve mining laws and regulations, encourage mineral investment, and support the independent operation and free development of mine merchants, so as to open up natural resources and accommodate a large number of labor forces. (Explanation) Dr. Sun Yat-sen said that the mining industry is the greatest main cause of material civilization and economic progress. In the past, China's mining industry can be said to have achieved nothing. Local officials and the people often hindered it. In the future, we must adopt active protection and encouragement. The first thing to consider is the improvement of mining regulations, with the main goal of reducing the burden, facilitating mining, and guaranteeing investment. Except for a few minerals related to basic industries, private operation should be encouraged across the board, and foreign investment should be welcomed. At the same time, local government personnel and special forces are prohibited from controlling mining rights and competing with the people for profits. (4) Promote the levy of labor, support the government in implementing the levy of labor system, encourage the people to participate in voluntary labor, especially the development of transportation roads, the construction of water conservancy, the cultivation of forests, and the development of reclaimed land, etc., as the basic work of the levy of labor. At the same time, implement the military work policy and the levy of labor system in parallel, so that the army can subsidize the deficiencies in the labor of various places, and lead the construction of local public works. (Explanation) Building roads, dredging rivers, building dikes, planting forests, reclaiming wasteland, etc. are all necessary conditions for developing natural resources, and they require a large amount of labor. It is appropriate to implement them with the levy of labor system. We advocate that all adult people in the country should have the obligation to serve the country and the local area, and the government should clearly stipulate the time limit for serving the country for several months in a lifetime, and the time limit for serving the local area for several days each year. The former is engaged in large-scale public works, and the latter is for the county, district, or rural area where it is located, doing work related to farmland, water conservancy, roads, sanitation, public buildings, etc. In addition, the implementation of the levy of labor in various places must first be preceded by propaganda and training, and then followed by guidance and implementation. The benefits must be told, and everything must be prepared (such as food, housing, tools, etc.). Responsible personnel and institutions must be prepared in advance, so that time and effort will not be wasted, and labor will be voluntary, and it will naturally become a habit over time. (5) Promote industry. For rural simple industries and simple industries for processing and manufacturing agricultural products, it is proposed to operate them in or near rural areas according to the cooperative system. For general industries, the government will protect and encourage them separately. On the one hand, labor-capital adjustment agencies will be established. In the event of labor-capital disputes, fair mediation will be provided, and the agency must be given the power of final compulsory execution, so as to protect the safety of enterprises and the work of laborers. (6) Adjust consumption, count the types and quantities of consumption in various places, especially in rural areas, and strive to adjust supply and demand. Consumers must try to produce as much as possible themselves, and those who cannot produce must try to save their consumption. This work must be carried out jointly by local professional groups and cooperatives, and must be supported by the import industry association. (Explanation) The main purpose of this is to prevent the outflow of funds from the inland and rural areas. The further intention is to seek the balance of foreign trade imports and exports. Therefore, facilitating the export of raw materials, reducing the burden on export products, and eliminating the difficulties of export products are also one of the tasks of this movement. The cooperation and support of the export industry association should be sought. (7) Smooth cargo transportation. On the one hand, vigorously develop road transportation between counties and provinces, improve water and land cargo transportation, and strive for the convenience of cargo circulation. On the other hand, establish public warehouses and marketing agencies for major agricultural products in various important areas, such as cotton, wheat, rice, silk, and tea. (8) Adjust finance, encourage private savings, and invigorate the circulation of funds. The government implements a sound monetary policy and redeemable policy, and the people sincerely support it.</p>
<p>(7) Preliminary Work Steps of the National Economic Construction Movement</p>
<p>(1) Regarding investigation and statistics, all kinds of materials related to this movement, whether for people, things, or objects, should have detailed investigation and statistics and collection, which will be presided over by the general agency and assisted by national public and private institutions and educational institutions. The materials needed in various places will be supplied by the general agency. (2) Regarding the concentration of talents, establish a specialized talent investigation and registration agency, classify their professional or technical expertise, and when domestic industrial institutions need specialized talents, the general agency should find ways to introduce and supply them. If there are no suitable experts in the country, then introduce foreign experts to take charge. This work of investigating and supplying talents should make full use of the assistance of various academic groups. (3) Regarding research and design, such as how to implement the military district agricultural reclamation system, how to implement the military work policy, how to improve the levy of labor system, how to balance import and export trade, how to expand the use of the cooperative system to solve the chain of production, consumption, marketing, and simple industry and rural areas, etc., should be studied on the spot. This research work is presided over by the general agency, or entrusted to the corresponding agency to handle it, and solicit the cooperation of the competent authorities and public and private groups. (4) Regarding the training of talents, regarding the work of undertaking preliminary propaganda, investigation, and guidance, recruit volunteers for the National Economic Construction Movement, provide them with short-term training, and then assign them to serve. Regarding the service personnel needed to continue the movement, entrust various universities to establish various training classes for the National Economic Construction Movement to train them. (5) Regarding propaganda and guidance, in addition to technical guidance, it is necessary to provide specialized talents and personnel who have received higher training.</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>Personnel, regarding the preliminary propaganda and guidance work of this movement, should be undertaken by: 1. Staff and students of secondary schools and above in various places, personnel of social education institutions, and primary school teachers. 2. Presiders of agricultural, commercial, and industrial associations, import and export guilds, and other local groups in various places. 3. Employees of cooperatives that have been established in various places. 4. Senior officers of the troops stationed in various places. 5. Personnel of local governments and autonomous organs at all levels. (Explanation) Propaganda work is very necessary when promoting this movement. It is necessary to change the people's habit of ignoring production, eliminate the old concepts of superstition and complacency, clarify the necessity of various local economic constructions, and accept the state's policies on economic construction, as well as the meaning of compulsory labor, the improvement of production methods and management methods, and other matters related to promoting production and adjusting consumption. Many people must use various methods to promote them to the people. Matters related to national economic construction that are already in progress should also solve their doubts and guide their progress at the same time.</p>
<p>(8) Summary</p>
<p>The National Economic Construction Movement includes many aspects, and the manpower and material resources on which it relies for promotion are also unlimited. The government should cover and preside over the driving force, and especially rely on the sincere support of the national people for this movement related to life and death. Experts are valued for their talents, the people are valued for their efforts, and those with the ability to publicize and guide should not refuse the labor of running around and working. As for the members of industrial groups, they must be passionate about saving the country's economic crisis and be willing to accept the constraints of the group without fear of sacrifice. As for the way to proceed, there is no single way. Some are suitable for using the cooperative system, some are suitable for using the education system, some are suitable for using the military organization, some must have the cooperation of academic institutions or academic groups, and some must have the automation of industrial groups and production institutions themselves. In short, it is necessary to gather the enthusiasm of the national people and unite the full strength of farmers, businessmen, workers, students, and soldiers to work towards the same goal with the spirit of being inseparable from each other and the method of division of labor and cooperation. Here, the main significance and key points of implementation of this movement are roughly stated to correct the Chinese people and to seek broad sympathy and assistance. As for how to organize and implement it, in addition to organizing a general agency to promote it, the specific programs are costly to study. The points mentioned in this article are inevitably missing, and it is necessary to supplement and revise them at any time. It is hoped that experts and practitioners across the country who care about economic construction will express their high opinions so that this movement can fully exert its effectiveness.

<p>Asmara: Our special correspondent Baal reports that the fall of Aksum is indeed the first major strategic victory for the Italian troops. The Italian troops captured the city of Adwa a few days ago, but its purpose was only to avenge the shame of the defeat in 1896, and it was not of great military significance. However, Aksum is 2,000 meters above sea level and is a fortress in northern Ethiopia. After the Italian troops have captured the city, they can use the watershed between Eritrea and central Ethiopia to build fortifications, overlooking a valley about 300 kilometers long. From here, they can advance and capture the core of Ethiopia. An Italian consulate official, who came here from Aksum, told reporters about the scenery of the city, saying that the city can be called the religious capital of Ethiopia, with churches, monasteries, and monuments everywhere. The largest monument is 40 meters wide. The whole city is located on a barren plateau, and the most important buildings are two ancient fortresses, one of which is the former palace of Emperor Nawlik. After the Italian troops occupied the area, they will use it as an air force base. Outside the gate of Asmara, there are now 30,000 workers rushing to build roads in the hot climate, working up to 20 hours a day. According to reporters' observations, the Italian leaders are not eager for success, but are willing to use all their strength to strengthen the Italian rear position. (Havas, 8th)</p>

<p>Djibouti: France has today added troops to Dil Dawa. If the Italian troops cut off the Jinji Railway, it seems that an international incident will occur. Today, 160 white colonial troops have been sent to protect the railway. They are all veterans of the Moroccan campaign. At the same time, 900 Senegalese riflemen have been stationed at the junction of Italian Eritrea and Ethiopia. As for how the road protection troops are trained, it is still a secret. It is reported that France has decided to maintain the transportation of the railway. According to the agreement between the railway and the government, if the train stops for more than four months, the Ethiopian government can take back the ownership of the road.

<p>(Rome) The Ethiopian minister to Italy, Yessous, has been summoned home and is waiting for a boat to depart for the French port of Djibouti in East Africa. The mail boats of France and Germany are the best choices for the boat he intends to take. Although the Italian government has issued a passport, it refuses to provide any protection for Yessous's private property in Asmara, the capital of Italian Eritrea, because the private property has been confiscated by the local authorities after the start of the war between Italy and Ethiopia. (Havas Electric, 9th)</p>
<p>Addis Ababa: The Ethiopian government today instructed the Ethiopian Chargé d'Affaires in Italy to ask the Italian government for a passport and immediately return home, because the Ethiopian government has ordered the Italian Minister in Ethiopia, Count Vinci, to leave the country immediately. According to the usual practice, the withdrawal of diplomatic representatives is the first step in the outbreak of war between the two countries. However, Italy and Ethiopia have not officially declared war, but General Graziani, the commander-in-chief of the Italian army in East Africa, issued a proclamation on October 3, announcing the start of the war. The reason for the Ethiopian government's order to the Italian minister to leave the country is that the Italian minister's office has become a center of espionage and conspiracy, and the staff of the Italian minister's office are all engaged in secret plots to disrupt the public security of Ethiopia.

Van Ingen also announced that the foreign missions and consuls in Addis Ababa have agreed to ask their respective governments to negotiate with the Italian government to prevent aerial bombardment in Addis Ababa and Dire Dawa.

Political figures here commented that this is a preliminary test to limit the effectiveness of aircraft bombing cities, saying that if all countries follow the U.S. example and make requests, Italian aircraft will hardly be able to bomb the Ethiopian capital. Political figures also believe that the U.S. government's move is actually a kind of support for the League of Nations' action. In addition, German newspapers pointed out that U.S. Republican newspapers have criticized President Roosevelt's neutrality policy very harshly. (Havas, 8th)</p>

<p>(London) The Archbishop of Canterbury today, at the 65th Church Congress in Bournemouth, made a speech sharply condemning Italy, which has caused a very deep impression. It is widely believed that the speech was the result of the Archbishop's meeting with British Foreign Secretary Hoare yesterday. He said, "We gather here with mixed feelings of grief and indignation. A major European power, having signed the League of Nations Covenant and the Paris Pact, actually discards these sacred and solemn obligations and launches a fierce attack on another member of the League of Nations. How can we not be indignant? If there is any act of unprovoked aggression in the world, it is Italy's. Although Abyssinia may be considered a backward country, when we think of an ancient nation whose military preparations are inadequate and medical supplies are lacking, and which, in order to defend its territory, is being swept away without a trace by all kinds of ruthless weapons of scientific invention that destroy humanity, how can we not feel sorrow and concern? He and others will now issue a document appealing to the people of the country to assist the Red Cross work within Abyssinia." The Archbishop concluded by saying that he supports the suggestion of Labour Party leader Lansbury to convene an international conference to consider a more equitable distribution of undeveloped and economically profitable resources in the world.

<p>(London) According to diplomatic sources at Havas, the Italian government recently put forward two demands: (1) that the Anglo-Italian laws be repealed, and (2) that Abyssinian territory be divided into two parts: one being the core territory of Abyssinia, and the other being the territory conquered by Abyssinia in the last fifty years, which would be regarded as Abyssinian dependencies. Negotiations for peace could only proceed on the basis of this division. It is understood that Britain currently finds both demands unacceptable. It is said that Britain is only willing to agree not to increase the strength of the British fleet in the Mediterranean, but on the condition that Italy withdraws its troops stationed in Italian Cyrenaica (adjacent to Egypt) as an exchange. This is the only concession that Britain is likely to make, and there is no doubt that Italy will not consider this concession satisfactory. (8th Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>(Berlin) The German political circles are deeply astonished by France's reply to Britain's inquiry about whether France would come to Britain's aid if Italian warships attacked the British fleet in the Mediterranean without cause. Public opinion believes that France is now seeking to profit from international tensions to achieve its own political goals and to trap Britain in the web of France's collective alliance policy. The Börsen Zeitung published an article that appeared to be authorized by the authorities, stating that France is actually demanding that Britain allow it to station troops on the German border, without allowing Germany to interpret this move as a threat or provocation. France's demand is incompatible with the League of Nations Covenant and is an attempt to destroy the Locarno Pact. (9th Reuters)</p>

Just as Aiden, the Minister without Portfolio for League of Nations Affairs, has the duty of cultivating friendship between European countries, so too could the moral force of Britain's long-standing friendship with China and Japan be applied to the future relationship between China and Japan, a problem that will constantly exist in the Pacific in the coming years.

The full text has nine articles. Unless otherwise stipulated in the treaty, the regulations apply to Chinese citizens who go abroad to work as employees. Workers going abroad are divided into three types: those selected by the government, those recruited by contractors, and those who go abroad as employees individually. Workers going abroad must meet the following four qualifications: 1. Be between 20 and 45 years old; 2. Be in good health; 3. Have no infectious diseases; 4. Have no bad habits. Employment contracts for workers going abroad, except for those selected by the government, which are signed by the government on their behalf, shall be handled in accordance with the Outline of Employment Contracts for Workers Going Abroad stipulated by the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission. Labor contractors shall not recruit individuals to go abroad unless approved by the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission. When workers go abroad to work as employees, they shall apply for registration with the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission before they can apply for a passport. Interpreters needed by workers shall not be appointed unless they have been approved and certified by the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission. The case is a revision of the Overseas Chinese Workers Regulations promulgated by the former Beijing government, and its purpose is to protect overseas Chinese workers and avoid human trafficking. (2) Amendment to Articles 16 and 22 of the Simple Life Insurance Law. Resolution: The review reports of the Law and Economics Committees were passed. The main point of the amendment is to appropriately tighten the compensation conditions in the current law when the insured dies within one year after the insurance contract becomes effective or is reinstated, in order to avoid losses.

<p>American Cotton: The New York cotton market opened slightly higher, not falling with Liverpool. After opening, the market price gradually rose due to strong demand from the same industry. Most brokers still hold bullish views, because the international situation is still serious, the cotton harvest is late, and the number sold in the market has been absorbed by the same industry.</p>
<p>British Cotton: The Liverpool cotton market was more loose this morning due to the price drop in the American market yesterday. At 1:00 PM, the January futures price was 6.09, down five pounds.</p>
<p>British Wheat: The Liverpool wheat market saw continued liquidation due to good reports from Argentina and Australia. At 1:00 PM, the December futures price was 6 shillings 3 pence 875, down 625.</p>
<p>American Wheat: The Chicago wheat market opened slightly lower due to unfavorable telegrams from Liverpool and better reports on the southern wheat crop. However, later, because most domestic labor was stable, new buying emerged, and the market price quickly rebounded to yesterday's closing price. The opening price of coarse grains fell and failed to follow the wheat market rebound, because the domestic selling was higher than before.</p>
<p>Rubber</p>
<p>The London rubber market was stable this morning. The opening price for January-March futures remained unchanged at 6 pence 125, and there were no changes later.</p>
<p>New York: The opening price of rubber in New York was a few pounds higher than yesterday's closing price. It remained stable throughout the morning. Interest from outsiders was not strong. Most operators seemed to be standing by, waiting for concrete progress in the statistical situation.</p>
<p>Securities</p>
<p>The New York stock market opened today with some unchanged and some slightly higher. Later, it tightened slightly, with public utility stocks showing a stronger uptrend. Metal and oil stocks opened slightly lower, but later became firm. The Dow Jones 30 Industrial Average opened at 130.7, up eleven pounds. The prices are as follows:</p>

<p>Kowloon Murder and Robbery Case</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) A murder and robbery case occurred in Kowloon tonight. The location was near the Chinese Water and Electricity Company branch in Sanshui Pu (phonetic). At 5:00 PM, when a car carrying a Chinese revenue collector and two Indian police officers drove out of the branch, three Chinese men, all armed, suddenly jumped onto the car and opened fire. One Indian policeman died on the spot. The other two curled up under the car and escaped death. The bandits snatched a briefcase containing 4,000 yuan and fled into the crowd. People dared not catch them because they were carrying guns. The two Indian police officers had no weapons, so they could not resist. (9th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e83">Chairman Su Chen Releases Message to Jiangsu Province <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>Chairman Su Chen Guofu released a message to the people of Jiangsu Province on the Double Tenth Festival, saying: "Guofu has been in charge of Jiangsu's administration for nearly two years. On the occasion of this National Day, I remember the hardship of the pioneers in creation and hold the responsibility for the local area in mind. I only hope that our government and people will be of one mind and advance towards brightness. I would like to express my enthusiasm for the future of Jiangsu Province and briefly express what I want to say. Looking back at the past, we are ashamed of not having significant achievements to comfort the people of the state. Recalling that Jiangnan suffered a drought last year, and its vitality has not been fully recovered, and this autumn, the Yellow River burst in western Shandong and suddenly flooded northern Jiangsu, with calamities coming one after another, which was unexpected. As a result, both spiritual and material resources are exhausted, and all facilities are frustrated. However, fortunately, personnel have worked diligently to make up for it, so that this irresistible disaster can be reduced to a lesser extent. This is all due to the efforts of our local officials and people to fulfill their duties and fight together. What the Provincial Government has been striving for in the past two years is to use the influence of personality and the strictness of prohibitions to gradually achieve the hope of clean government in terms of official governance. However, this is only the lowest requirement in our political ideals. The promotion of other major undertakings, such as the complete establishment of Jiangnan and Jiangbei Baojia, has laid a foundation for the effectiveness of organizing the people. The establishment of a financial system provides later generations with rules to follow, and all kinds of malpractices are not easy to revive. The suppression of bandits in Jiangbei has roughly stabilized local order, which has not been seen in more than ten years. The expansion of compulsory education has been determined in terms of funding sources and implementation methods, and the number of out-of-school children can be reduced year by year. Opium and drugs have undermined the national physique and damaged the economy. The four-year ban plan has been strictly implemented. The government's clear attitude and unwavering determination have been widely understood by the public, and have aroused social sympathy and sanctions. All of these things depend on the dedication of our officials, and we cannot say that there has been no slight achievement. However, introspection and self-evaluation are all within the scope of duty. What we are most gratified about and have unlimited hope for is the greatness of the performance of the people's ability. Take water conservancy as an example. For example, the diversion of the Huai River into Xun and other dredging projects in various places have achieved more than 30 million square feet in the province in one year, employing as many as 500,000 people. In particular, the work of preventing the Yellow River in Tongshan and Haizhou in recent months, with millions of square feet and hundreds of miles of long dikes, has been built at a moment's notice, with courage and speed that are beyond reach. If we can follow this example and develop it, the foundation of agricultural production in the province will definitely be firmly established, not only to deal with the immediate problem of disaster relief.</p>
<h2>Page 13</h2>
<p>At present, the priority of the policy is still water management. The Yellow River has burst in the lower reaches of the Yi, Mu, and Wei rivers, and although the Liu Tang Guanhe is being dredged, the evolution is still unknown. With the great disaster at hand, without urgent relief, there is no way to talk about other benefits. The government will devote all its efforts to it in the near future. The second is disaster relief. In the counties in northern Jiangsu that have been flooded, the number of displaced people has reached millions. The government has an unshirkable responsibility to provide shelter and urgently allocate funds to plan for post-disaster work, and the people of other parts of the province that have not been affected by the disaster should have sympathy with the people, and remember the ancient meaning of "wearing hairpins and hats," and devote their efforts to relief. This is what the government is willing to work with the people. Furthermore, based on the facts of the past two years, the relationship between the government and the people has become increasingly harmonious. With the cooperation and support of the people, the government has increased its confidence and is striving to improve itself. With the leadership of the government, the steps and will of the people have become more adjusted. In the future, the fundamental plan should focus on the construction of agriculture and industry, and seek a thorough reform for the economic production of the people. We firmly believe that the people of the province, with the spirit of success achieved in the past two years, and together with the government, will surely be able to achieve even greater achievements and build a perfect Jiangsu, which will be seen by the people of the country. Then it can be celebrated for the Republic of China, not only for the future of Jiangsu Province.</p>

<p>Matsui Yegoro Denies Connection with the Japanese Side; Mongolian Political Council Plans to Incorporate them into Security Forces</p>
<p>Peiping Correspondence: After the settlement of the Hebei issue, the security force issue has been delayed for a long time. Currently, there are approximately three thousand surplus security team police and vagrants from Luan East, who arrived in Chahar East on the 3rd of this month and are concentrated in the Datan area. In addition to dispatching personnel to investigate, the Chahar authorities also inquired with Matsui Yegoro, the Japanese military liaison officer stationed in Zhangjiakou. According to Matsui, these vagrants are refugees from the Ao East area and have no connection with the Japanese side. Tushihai, a member of the Mongolian Political Council and concurrently commander of the Twelfth Security District of Chahar Province (Mongolian name: Tete Bajar), plans to incorporate these vagrants into the Mongolian security forces.</p>
<h3 id="e85">Western Travels: Observations and Experiences - By Song Hua, Reporter for This Newspaper's Monthly Publication - A Pilgrimage to Yichang <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>Yichang, known in ancient times as Yiling, is the gateway to Sichuan. The reporter took the Minzheng steamer of the Minsheng Industrial Company from Hankou to Chongqing. Passing through here on the afternoon of September 28th at 4:00 PM, I disembarked and strolled along Binjiang Road, Second Ma Road, Nanmen, and other places. The streets were clean, and the people were frugal. This place has recently experienced two false alarms. One was a bandit alert in the countryside not far away. The other was the sudden arrival of several Japanese warships, causing suspicion among the residents. However, when the reporter arrived, the Japanese warships had already left, and the bandit alert had been completely resolved. The surrounding countryside was peaceful. Only one ship was seen at the pier, fully loaded with troops. Their artillery unit had just landed, and the military appearance was very orderly.</p>
<p>The reporter visited Mr. Mu Zibin of the Yichang National Daily News. According to his account of the commercial, journalistic, and educational situation in Yichang, although Yichang has some famous products, the production volume is not large. Among them, only cotton production is relatively high, but it is still not as good as Shashi. It can be said that there are no significant export products. Yichang's past prosperity was due to its role as a transportation hub in commerce. However, since direct shipping routes between Chongqing and Shanghai have become available, Yichang's commerce has been greatly affected, and local finances are also facing difficulties due to reduced tax revenue. In the past, there were many Bai Mu boats transporting goods between Chongqing and Yichang. When crowded, they almost covered the river surface. Now, they are becoming increasingly scarce. The number of boatmen who have lost their jobs is unknown, and there is no way to provide relief. The prevalence of bandits in Sichuan is one reason for this. Currently, the most important export commodity from Yichang is tung oil. As for commodities such as lacquer, hemp, and shells from Sichuan Province, they are now being transshipped through Badong, so Badong's commerce is gradually flourishing. In terms of journalism in Yichang, in addition to the National Daily News, which sells 1,500 copies daily, there are also the Industrial and Commercial Daily and the Yiling Daily, but their sales are smaller. Before opium was banned, there were many news agencies, as many as twenty-two. Each news agency received subsidies from the Special Tax Office. After the opium ban, the subsidies were cancelled, and the number of news agencies decreased. Currently, only three remain. Therefore, local news in Yichang newspapers is mostly collected by the reporters themselves. Other news is mostly excerpted from major newspapers brought by airmail from Shanghai, Tianjin, and Wuhan. In addition, news reports obtained from wireless radio are also a source of information. In terms of education, there are still many local schools, and the situation is good. The Yichang branch of the Provincial Public Education Center is also working hard to promote public education, so illiteracy is gradually decreasing. However, the countryside is very poor, and coupled with the previous floods, the lives of farmers are very difficult. In several villages, farmers are even eating tree bark and grass roots due to famine, which is very tragic. Mr. Mu also said that the largest factory in Yichang, such as the electric light plant, is entirely commercially operated. However, the market has been very sluggish recently, and it is quite difficult to start an industry. In the future, if someone starts a yarn factory or small industry, there is potential for development. Because I heard that Yichang is still under curfew at night, I needed to return to the ship that evening, so I did not have time to inspect the situation in other places. Yichang has many scenic spots, such as the Three Travelers Cave, Dongshan Temple, Nanhu Lake, Erya Terrace, Guansheng Tower, Zhishu Mountain, and Dragon King Cave, all of which are famous. Unfortunately, due to the urgency of boarding the ship, I did not have time to visit them. However, when I arrived at Nanmen, I passed by Guansheng Tower. The tower is very tall and majestic. According to legend, Guan Gong once reined in his horse here to look out at Jingzhou. Because it was already dark, I did not go up to the tower to admire it.</p>
<h3 id="e86">Tianjin Kidnapping Case: Important Bandits Executed - Fifteen Principals Sentenced to Death - Accomplices Sentenced to Imprisonment - The Bar Association Pays Close Attention to This Case <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: The appalling kidnapping and murder case in Tianjin has been investigated by the British Concession Bureau of Works since the 13th of last month, in cooperation with the detective police of the Tianjin Public Security Bureau. Fifteen principals and thirteen male and female suspects have been arrested. After interrogation by the British Bureau of Works, they were extradited to the Public Security Bureau, and then transferred to the Tianjin-Kou Security Headquarters, where the Military Law Office of the headquarters tried them according to the law on punishing bandits. Each suspect was interrogated separately three times. The suspects confessed to the kidnapping, extortion, and internal organization. The Tianjin community was extremely indignant at the fact that the bandits had been organized for three years, killing people to cover their tracks, and not releasing the victims even after receiving the ransom. Therefore, they paid close attention to the authorities' judgment. In order to appease public anger, the Tianjin-Kou Security Headquarters sought to expedite the process. When the head of the Military Law Office, Director Zhao, took over the case, he went to Beiping to consult with Shang Zhen and the Military Branch Committee. After returning, in addition to the bandits' confessions, he investigated the evidence. It was not until October 4th that the verdict was finalized. The fifteen principals, including Zhang Lianke, were sentenced to death, while the suspects, including Dan Lao Gai and Dan Zhang Shi, were sentenced to imprisonment or sent to the Public Security Bureau to be released on bail. On the 4th, Director Zhao took the written record of the judgment to Beiping to meet with Shang Zhen and present the proposed plan. Shang instructed Zhao to transfer the matter to Yan Wenhai, the head of the 11th group of the Military Branch Committee, to discuss a quick execution plan. The committee believed that the bandits' kidnapping and murder should be punished early to appease the people, so it ordered Zhao to return to Tianjin and execute the sentence immediately, with the official procedures to be completed later. On the morning of the 6th, an telegram from the Military Branch Committee arrived in Tianjin. In order to quickly execute the sentence, the Security Department drafted a proclamation on the same day, and at 2:00 PM, the prisoners were brought out of the Army Prison. Adjutant Gao Hua and Captain Sha Jinzhang of the Special Service Battalion were appointed as executioners. The Public Security Bureau Security Team was also notified to dispatch the 7th, 14th, and Mounted Patrol Teams to patrol the area from the Tianjin-Kou Security Headquarters along Hebei Dajing Road to Xiaowangzhuang. After the prisoners were tied up in the Security Headquarters, the military judicial officer verified their identities. Three trucks were used to transport them to the Xiaowangzhuang execution ground. Along the way, the crowds were so large that traffic was cut off. Westerners, shocked by the gravity of the case, also went to watch. The bandits asked for wine and cigarettes along the streets, causing constant disturbances. At 3:00 PM, the trucks arrived at the Xiaowangzhuang execution ground. The bandits continued to shout and scream. The executioner immediately ordered the firing squad to open fire. Before they could kneel down, they were pushed one by one to the roadside and shot in the back of the head. By the time it came to the last two, Kong Fancheng and Tian Zhangshi, they had already lost all color and collapsed to the ground. They were each shot several times and killed. After the bandits died, local laborers were hired to carry them to the cemetery for burial. Before the execution of the bandits, someone had visited them in the Army Prison. According to Zhang Lianke, the organization of the bandit gang was initiated by Yang Enhong, a notorious bandit under Liu Siwaibai, who disturbed the Yutian area. Liu was killed by government troops. Yang and his accomplices Wang Zian and Deng Zhi hid in Tianjin and committed crimes in the suburbs of Tianjin. They became acquainted with Zhang and others. Zhang and others originally had occupations, either as rice shop managers or salesmen. They were initially lured into gambling until they became indebted and lost their jobs, or their businesses failed, and they turned to banditry. At the beginning of their crimes, they could not bear to kill the victims, but later they became accustomed to it and brutally murdered twelve people. Only Yang Enhong and Wang Zian escaped, which they resented. As for the female bandit Tian Zhangshi, she was the mother-in-law of Dan Yuhua and specialized in renting houses and scouting routes. She was extremely vicious.</p>
<h3 id="e87">Execution of the Communist Bandit Xu Yangang <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>The Bandit Xu Hid in Civilians' Homes to Avoid Search and Suppression; Plainclothes Troops Killed the Bandit Xu on the Spot.</p>
<p>Yifeng Correspondence: The bandit leader Xu Yangang was recently killed by the 50th Division during a search and suppression operation. The details of the process are as follows: The bandit Xu Yangang, a native of Sichuan, had military training and was extremely brutal. Following Kong Hechong and Gao Yongsheng, he disturbed the border area of Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi provinces, committing murder and robbery, and all kinds of evil deeds. In 1934, the Nationalist Army's 50th Division conducted a month-long suppression, and the bandit forces suffered heavy losses, with only thirty remaining rifles. Later, due to the 50th Division's transfer to Yuanshui, the bandit Xu took the opportunity to flee to the Gold Cave in southern Hubei. He then collected pseudo-guerrilla teams from various places, and secretly grew in strength. Since this spring, he has coerced more people, reaching over six thousand, with four thousand long and short guns, and more than fifty light and heavy machine guns. He has been roaming around, and his勢益猖獗 (strength becomes more rampant). Since the summer, the central government has mobilized large forces and built blockhouses to seal off the area, in order to suppress the bandits. When the Nationalist Army launched a large-scale encirclement and suppression, Xu himself originally wanted to take advantage of the fact that the armies had not yet completely surrounded the area to flee west and join forces with Xiao He. However, due to disagreements with the pseudo-political commissars Fu Qiutao and Fang Buzhou, the plan was not implemented. At this time, he had already become a turtle in a jar. After charging left and right, he broke out near Maishi. At that time, he still had five battalions of bandits, and his weapons accounted for half of the total. He reorganized them into three regiments, each regiment with three infantry companies and one machine gun platoon, each company with more than one hundred soldiers and eighty or ninety guns, and one light machine gun. The machine gun company had three or four light machine guns each, and two heavy machine guns. 通山·崇陽·咸寗 (Tongshan, Chongyang, Xianning). 陽新 (Yangxin). 大冶 (Daye). and other counties, and went straight down the Yangtze River to the Matouzhen township belonging to Ruichang, attempting to flee to the Xiu·銅·宜·奉·永·靖 (Xiu, Tong, Yi, Feng, Yong, Jing) area, in order to survive a little longer. Unexpectedly, 天奮共 (heaven was indignant), ending his bestial life at the foot of Yunju Mountain.</p>
<p>Zhu, the brigade commander of the 149th Brigade of the 50th Division, was ordered to pursue and suppress the bandit Xu. Before the operation, he knew exactly where Xu was. On August 27th, he ordered his troops to advance towards Jing'an, with the main force towards the area near Yunju Mountain, to clear and suppress the area in sections, achieving many victories. He also sent telegrams to the local government, the Marine Corps stationed in Anyi, and the local militias to assist in capturing the main culprit and eliminating the scourge for the people. Later, according to the confessions of captured bandits, Xu had already been wounded and was hiding in the deep mountains near the Taizi Temple. Therefore, the deployment was strengthened, and the troops were ordered to form more plainclothes teams, all disguised, to avoid the bandits' attention. At this time, in order to reduce the target, Xu broke away from his main force and brought a few trusted bandits, hoping to escape. Who knew that the net was so tight that it was impossible to escape?</p>
<p>When the plainclothes team of the 297th Regiment of the brigade was searching near Zhukeng on the afternoon of September 19th, citizens reported that there were three bandits in the Huang family's house nearby. Upon hearing this, the team leader Zhou Debiao surrounded the house and led two soldiers straight into the house. At this time, two or three residents in the house, seeing the Nationalist Army arriving, were emboldened and used an axe to chop to death a bandit wearing a pistol. The plainclothes team leader also pounced on another bandit. The bandit was extremely fierce, and just as they were embracing each other, the residents of the house came out to help. At the same time, the plainclothes soldiers grabbed their guns and struck the bandit's head, hitting a vital point, and killing him instantly. The team leader found a ruler with the words "Li Ming" engraved on it. The team leader Zhou Debiao and his adjutant Chen Ying knew that this bandit had an unusual background, so they temporarily buried the body and reported it to the regimental commander, who reported it to the brigade commander Zhu. After many confirmations, they learned that this bandit was Xu Yangang himself.</p>
<p>Earlier, the 149th Brigade captured Fang Haoran, the pseudo-commander of the Second Combat Division of Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi, near Guoshuzhu on September 12th. He confessed that he had left Xu not long ago and knew for sure that only Xu carried a ruler pistol. He also explained that this gun was formerly carried by Li Ming, the commander of the 52nd Division. Therefore, it was determined that the bandit killed by the team was undoubtedly Xu Yangang. They then ordered the surrendered adjutant Xiong Shiping, who had known Xu, to lead the plainclothes team of the 298th Regiment and escort several captured bandits to verify the identity. According to the verification results, the bandit who was killed with an axe was Wang Fasheng, the scout accompanying Xu. The bandit who was killed by the gun was indeed Xu himself. The body of the bandit was carried back to the brigade headquarters in Taizi Street. Brigade Commander Zhu then interrogated the captured bandits in detail, inspected the body in person, and obtained confessions and evidence. On the 22nd, he used a car to transport it to the 50th Division Headquarters in Yifeng, and then transferred it to the Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi Border Area Bandit Suppression Command in Puqi.</p>
<h3 id="e88">Shandong Women's Morality Association Holds Inaugural Meeting in Jinan - Initiated by Madam Han and Others <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Madam Gao Shengkun, wife of the Shandong Provincial Government Chairman Han, and others, in view of the fact that modern Chinese women, innovators, only admire vanity, do not restrain themselves, and abandon their inherent responsibilities, while conservatives are weak and incompetent, with shallow knowledge, and cling to past陋習 (陋習 = bad habits), resulting in the burial of the inherent old morality, and the true spirit of women, obliterated without a trace. The more developed women's rights, the more decadent life becomes, the more advanced civilization, the more corrupt the customs. If this is not urgently remedied, then advocating women's rights will only destroy women's rights, and the world's观念 (观念 = concept) of 重男輕女 (valuing men over women) will never be eliminated. In order to correct women's bad habits and restore women's morality, they have specially contacted women from all walks of life to organize the Shandong Women's Morality Promotion Association. After a long period of preparation, the inaugural meeting was held at the Provincial Theater at 2:00 PM on the 6th. Attendees included initiators Han Gao Shengkun, Yang Wu Ruiyun, Zhang Ma Zhiliang, Zhang Runfan, Han Guiqing, Gao Shuxiu, Wan Zhichao, Lv Cui Shiying, Xin Hao Deqing, Zhao Fu Zhifang, Dong Yang Yuzhen, Wang Li Lurong, Wang Xiaomei, Zhang Yang Airu, Xu Fan, Gao Tongfang, sponsors Zhang Shaotang, Jin Hanqing, Xin Zhujiu, etc. After the meeting began as scheduled, Chairman Zhang Runfan first reported on the establishment process, saying: "Today is the day of the establishment of our Women's Morality Association. Since the association was prepared last year, the directors and staff have been elected. Today is the supplementary election ceremony and the directors will take office. Please guide the instructors, supervisors, and guests in everything. As for the preparation process of this association, it is because morality has been lost in recent years, and people in general do not know what morality is, leading to fathers and sons ignoring each other, and brothers killing each other. We women are even more pitiful. Since Chairman Chiang Kai-shek advocated the New Life Movement, Madam Han, wife of our Chairman, also felt the need to reform women's lives. Therefore, she has been preparing for the Women's Association since last year, in order to improve women's lives. Although there are many difficulties in this matter, we must work hard to do it, no matter how difficult it is. This association held a preparatory meeting on August 1st. Afterwards, the directors and presidents and vice presidents were elected. The future plans of this association are: (1) To organize a Women's Morality Monthly, (2) To establish a Morality Society, (3) To establish a Morality Lecture Society, (4) To establish a Morality Education Class, (5) To establish a Craft Class." Next, Gao Shengkun gave a speech on behalf of the Chairman's wife, saying: "Today, I am very honored to be able to say a few words on behalf of the Chairman's wife. At the same time, I am also very sorry. However, since I have been ordered to come, I cannot but say a few words. China has the bad habit of 重男輕女 (valuing men over women). Men and women are both people, so why are all responsibilities on the shoulders of men? In my opinion, the goodness or badness of men depends entirely on the education of their mothers, as in the case of Mencius's mother. The bad habit of women being inferior to men is not a temporary relationship. Confucius said, 'Only petty men and women are difficult to raise.' Because of this sentence, women's status has declined. After the founding of the Republic of China, the state paid attention to women's education. Later, in the fifth and sixth years of the Republic, there was a theory that women should only receive primary education. Until the seventeenth year of the Republic, the revolutionary army unified the country, and men and women had equal educational opportunities. However, because it was the first time, they often went the wrong way. Last year, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek advocated the New Life Movement, which did not mean confining women at home, but wanted to cultivate women into virtuous wives and mothers from a moral point of view. This is a good opportunity for us women," and so on. Then, the instructors and guests gave speeches, and then the association staff were elected, and the elected staff gave acceptance speeches, and then the meeting was adjourned. The elected staff of the association were: President Han Gao Shengkun (wife of Chairman Han), Vice Presidents Yang Wu Ruiyun, Zhang Runfan, Honorary Presidents Zhang Ma Zhiliang, Wang Xiaomei, Zhao Fu Zhifang, Zhang Yang Airu, Wan Zhichao, Directors Han Gao Shengkun, Yang Wu Ruiyun, Zhang Runfan, Zhang Ma Zhiliang, Song Jianqiu, Gao Tongfang, Wang Chen Guiqing, Honorary Directors Gao Shuxiu, Lv Cui Shiying, Xin Hao Deqing, Yang Zhengqing, Zhao Ruiqing.

<p>The Total Amount of the Loan is Planned to be One Million Yuan - Four Provinces Hold Scheduled Meeting on Restoring Dikes and Blocking Breaches - Jiangsu Provincial Government Plans to Recover Breaches</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: After the breach of the Yellow River in Luxi at Dongzhuang, the Shandong Provincial Government, in addition to organizing a dike-repairing engineering committee to actively investigate the terrain and plan dike-repairing, has also devised methods to relieve the affected people in the disaster-stricken counties. As of the end of September, according to statistics from the Department of Civil Affairs, more than 300,000 disaster-stricken people in Luxi have been transported to the counties for shelter. Although the Central Relief Committee and philanthropists from all sides have repeatedly remitted relief funds, and public servants in the province have also donated from their salaries, it is still a drop in the bucket and insufficient for distribution. The Yellow Disaster Relief Committee recently calculated that the current remaining relief funds are only over 14,200 yuan. As the weather is getting colder, it is necessary to prepare items such as cotton clothing for the disaster victims. Even the food supply is in danger of being cut off immediately. On the 2nd, it was specially approved by Han Fuqu, Chairman of the Shandong Provincial Government, to temporarily borrow 150,000 yuan from the Military Supply Office of the General Command for temporary relief. However, with so many disaster victims, this sum is still difficult to rely on for long. It has been decided to first borrow one million yuan from various banks in Jinan as winter relief funds. This loan will be guaranteed by the salaries deducted from public servants throughout the province, or the donation remittances to Jinan will be used for repayment. Li Shuchun, the committee member and Director of the Department of Civil Affairs, Wang Xiangrong, the Director of the Department of Finance, and Xin Zhujiu, the committee member of the Provincial Relief Committee, invited the presidents of the Central, Transportation, China, Shanghai Commercial, and Industrial Banks in the city at noon on the 2nd to discuss and study the loan and repayment methods. The bank presidents then held a separate meeting to discuss the details. As a result, it was roughly determined that the banks in the city could jointly undertake 800,000 yuan, but it must be confirmed after consulting with the headquarters. The Yellow Disaster Relief Committee believes that this loan is related to the relief of disaster victims and should not be delayed. The committee held another meeting at the Provincial Relief Committee at noon on the 3rd to discuss the methods in order to realize the urgent rescue of the people as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Kong Xiangrong, the acting chairman of the Yellow River Conservancy Commission, was previously ordered by the National Economic Commission to work with the provincial governments of Henan, Hebei, Shandong, and Jiangsu to carefully survey and occupy the land for dike restoration and breach blocking, formulate construction plans, engineering fund amounts, and construction methods, and submit them to the commission for review by October 20th. Kong now believes that the deadline is approaching, and has specifically scheduled a meeting to be held in Kaifeng on the 15th of this month, inviting representatives from the main responsible agencies of the four provinces of Shandong, Jiangsu, Henan, and Hebei to bring their proposed plans to Kaifeng on time. In addition to sending telegrams to the three provinces of Henan, Hebei, and Jiangsu to quickly expedite the work and designate the main responsible agencies to send representatives to attend the meeting, he also sent a special telegram to Zhang Hanying, the Secretary-General of the commission, who recently came to Shandong, to consult with the Shandong Provincial Government and the Breach Blocking Committee on the progress and report to the commission, and ordered Zhang Hanying to return to Kaifeng to attend the meeting as well. As for the detailed plan and budget for the dike repair project in the province, it has been prepared by Zhou Li, the director of the engineering team, Song Wentian, the chief engineer, Pan Yifen, the chief of the engineering section of the River Affairs Bureau, and others at the breach. On the 3rd, Zhou Li and all personnel will return to Jinan from the construction site, and will likely consult with Zhang Hanying and Zhang Honglie, the chairman of the Breach Blocking Committee, once. After Han Fuqu reviews it, it can be decided. As for the selection of representatives, it has not yet been determined.</p>
<p>Chen Guofu, the Chairman of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, believes that the Yellow River flood in Shandong is gradually moving south, and the flow of water entering the Middle Canal from Weishan Lake has now reached 1,500 cubic meters per second, which is three times the maximum flow that the Middle Canal can drain. The Xu area has become a water country, and the Hai area will soon be submerged. In order to address the current emergency, he suggested to the Economic Commission two measures: recovering and blocking breaches. (1) Divert the water flowing out of the southern breach through Dongping Lake back to the river, or remove the Mianian dike in Juancheng to allow the water to flow within the dike and reduce the disaster area. (2) Gather materials and implement dike blocking projects to close the gap in the winter when the water is shallow. After accepting Chen's suggestions, the Economic Commission recently planned to order the Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission and the Shandong Provincial Government to review and handle it. Just as a letter from the Shandong Provincial Government reporting on the situation of preparing to block the breach arrived at the Economic Commission, the commission immediately forwarded the progress of the Shandong Provincial Government to Chen, and at the same time sent the plan for recovering and blocking breaches proposed by Chen to Shandong through Secretary-General Qin Fen. After receiving the two letters, Han Fuqu forwarded them to the Breach Blocking Committee on the 3rd. As for all the basic engineering for blocking breaches at the Yellow River mouth in the province, it has now begun separately. The main river water勢 (water potential/force) has not seen a major surge. The Chengge dike and the Li Shengtun remnant dike are also gradually taking shape. However, the River Affairs Bureau received an telegram from Chen Wenmo, the chief of the upstream section of the river, stating that the main flow of the Yellow River at Zhukou (Heze County) had been stable due to the previous drop in water, but on the 2nd, due to the surge in water, the main flow shifted again and directly approached Zhukou, causing the engineering situation to become tense again. Rescue efforts are currently underway. (Yan)</p>

<p>Shao Xingyu, Shao Xiuyu, and Shao Caiyu, villagers of the 4th household of the 2nd Jia of the 2nd Bao of the 5th District of Fengjing Xinzhuang Township, lived in the same village and were barely able to make a living. Unexpectedly, on the evening of the 8th, six or seven bandits with local accents, wearing waistbands as signs, broke in and robbed them, threatening them to remain silent, overturning boxes and chests, and escaping with their loot. They then went to the home of Shao Fugen, the 1st household of the 1st Jia of the 3rd Bao, and robbed again. When the villagers heard the alarm and gathered, the bandits fled north. Among the four families, Shao Xingyu suffered the greatest losses. The incident has been reported to the First Branch Bureau to request the Public Security Bureau to pursue and arrest the robbers.</p>

<p>Yesterday, two breaches occurred in Bianzhuang, Shidong Township, due to the recent surge in the volume of the Ning River in that area. One breach was about 20 zhang wide, and the other was about 8 or 9 zhang wide. The water势 (water force) was surging. Three-quarters of the farmland in the area has been flooded. The automobile road from Xinpu to Xinba has been washed away by the river and traffic has been cut off. The chief of the First District, Pan, immediately ordered the township chief Wang to quickly conscript 1,000 civilians and rush to block the two breaches day and night to prevent the disaster area from expanding.</p>

<p>Your newspaper stated yesterday that Section Chief Tong of the Customs Administration reported during the Memorial Week that the value of China's exports exceeded the value of imports in August and September, with tea ranking second and peanuts ranking third, and that imports were headed by cotton. After investigation, this is completely inconsistent with the reported facts. What was reported at the time was the import and export situation for the first half of this year and July and August. There was no mention of the value of exports exceeding the value of imports. Furthermore, tea ranked fourth and peanuts ranked fifth in exports in the first half of the year. 洋米 (imported rice) ranked first and 五金 (metal wares) ranked second in imports in the first half of the year. Please correct this immediately to avoid misunderstanding. Sincerely, Ji He, Accounting Section, Customs Administration, October 9th.</p>

<h3 id="e95">Hu Wenhu Yesterday Paid Respects to Chairman Lin <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>Hu Willingly Donates 70,000 Yuan to Build Mausoleum Water Tower</p>
<p>Since arriving in Shanghai, Mr. Hu Wenhu, a wealthy overseas Chinese businessman from Southeast Asia and the leader of the Malaysian Chinese athletes, has been extremely busy with various receptions. The other day, upon hearing that Chairman of the National Government had come to Shanghai from Nanjing to attend the opening ceremony of the National Games, he made a special trip to pay his respects. Afterwards, the Chairman also went to the Cangzhou Hotel to return the visit, but they did not meet due to time constraints. Yesterday morning, Mr. Hu again went to Chairman Lin's private residence on Jin Shenfu Road to pay his respects and was received. During their conversation, Chairman Lin mentioned that Mr. Hu had previously invested 200,000 yuan to build a hospital in Fuzhou, and a foundation stone laying ceremony would soon be held. The Fujian Provincial Government had repeatedly telegraphed Mr. Hu from Fujian, urging him to come to Fujian to preside over the ceremony, as they heard he was in Shanghai. Mr. Hu declined, saying he was too busy with affairs in Shanghai to go. He had asked Chairman Lin to preside over the ceremony, as Chairman Lin would be returning to his hometown by ship in the near future. However, Chairman Lin said that Mr. Hu was very enthusiastic about charitable causes and that the people of Fujian hoped he would visit Fujian soon to benefit his hometown, so he advised Mr. Hu to take some time to return to Fujian to preside over the foundation stone laying ceremony. Mr. Hu agreed. They then discussed the issue of drinking water for the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum in Nanjing. Chairman Lin said that the residents of the mausoleum often suffered from a lack of water, and that the lack of water sources made it difficult for the residential area to prosper. Therefore, he had long planned to build a water tower to help with the construction of the mausoleum, but lacked funding. When Mr. Hu visited Nanjing last year, Chairman Lin had mentioned this to him, and Mr. Hu agreed to donate the estimated cost of 50,000 yuan. He then asked Chairman Lin to have someone design and draw up the plans. The plans have now been drawn up, but the cost is 210,000 yuan. Chairman Lin planned to ask Mr. Hu to donate an additional 20,000 yuan, for a total of 70,000 yuan, to be used specifically for the construction of the water tower. Mr. Hu readily agreed. They had a pleasant conversation for half an hour before Mr. Hu took his leave. At noon, he attended a banquet hosted by the 96-year-old Mr. Ma Xiangbo. At 3:00 PM, he attended the inauguration ceremony of the new building of the Vagrant Habit Training Center (the new building was built with 12,000 yuan donated by Mr. Hu and has been completed) and the welcome party. Therefore, he was unable to attend the welcome party of the Guangdong Fellow Villagers Association.</p>

<p>Huang Fu, Minister of the Interior, went to Mogan Mountain for recuperation several months ago. It is now learned that Mr. Huang went down the mountain to Hangzhou on the 8th and visited Huang Shaohong, Chairman of the Zhejiang Provincial Government. After learning that President Wang of the Executive Yuan was scheduled to leave Nanjing for Shanghai on the 9th to participate in the opening ceremony of the National Games, he took a express train from Hangzhou to Shanghai at 9:45 AM yesterday morning to await the audience. He arrived at Shanghai West Station at 2:50 PM in the afternoon. His wife and attendant Wang Dagang also came with him. After getting off the train, he returned to his private residence to rest. Because he came to Shanghai in a hurry, there were few people welcoming him at the station. Mr. Huang plans to meet with President Wang today to make some requests.</p>
<p>Xu Paid a Visit</p>
<p>Xu Xiuzhi, Vice Minister of the Interior, learned of Mr. Huang's descent from the mountain to Shanghai and took a night express train from Nanjing to Shanghai, arriving at 7:15 AM yesterday morning. He drove to visit Mr. Huang at 4:00 PM in the afternoon and left at 4:45 PM. According to Mr. Xu, who spoke to a reporter from the Central News Agency, he came to Shanghai to meet Mr. Huang after learning that Minister Huang had come to Shanghai. Mr. Huang has not fully recovered from his illness. He will stay in Shanghai for a short time and then return to Hangzhou.</p>
<p>Returned to Hangzhou Immediately</p>
<p>According to Mr. Huang's attendants, who spoke to a reporter from the Central News Agency, Minister Huang came to Shanghai today purely to seek medical examination and treatment. He will stay in Shanghai for a short time and then return to Hangzhou for recuperation. As for Mr. Huang's condition, although he has been recuperating in the mountains for several months, and has been exposed to sunlight every day, he has not yet recovered. His left arm is still unable to be raised high, and his nostrils are still not clear. Therefore, he still needs to recuperate. Mr. Huang's illness worsened on the 8th of last month, and he went to Hangzhou for medical treatment. He was bedridden in Hangzhou for several days, with alternating chills and fever. After medical treatment and medication, he gradually recovered and left Hangzhou to return to the mountains for recuperation. This is enough to prove that Mr. Huang's illness is indeed real.</p>
<h3 id="e98">Aviation Circles Organize Flying Club; Officially Established Today <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>Promoting Civilian Interest in Aviation; Cultivating Talent Using Simple Methods</p>
<p>The China Aviation Association, in order to cultivate civil aviation talent, has been planning the establishment of a flying club for many years. It was submitted to the central government for approval of the organizational charter and internship outline, etc. The inaugural meeting was convened, and many members were elected. The club announced its establishment today. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Preparation Process</p>
<p>Aviators Sun Tonggang, Mao Bangchu, Nie Kaiyi, Chen Qingyun, Zeng Yijing, Huang Bingheng, Yao Xijiu, Shen Ai, Li Jingcong, Chen Wenlin, Qian Changzuo, etc., in order to promote the development of aviation among the public, initiated the organization of the Shanghai Flying Club in March last year and set up a preparatory office within the China Aviation Association to actively carry out preparations. Later, with the support of aviation seniors such as Central Committee Member Chen Qingyun and Zhang Huichang, as well as social leaders such as Du Yuesheng and Wu Yun Chu, who were willing to purchase training aircraft and donate them to the Flying Club for training pilots, the club received spiritual and economic support from all parties and intensified its preparations, so that it was able to officially announce its establishment today.</p>
<p>Established Today</p>
<p>The Flying Club officially announced its establishment today and will not hold any ceremonies. The members of the club will convene the first meeting within a few days to discuss the progress of the club's affairs and start recruiting students. According to a reporter from the Xin Xin News Agency, the club has now decided to borrow the Longhua Airport as a training field. In addition to the two aircraft previously donated by Du Yuesheng and Wu Yun Chu, several aircraft have been borrowed from aviation schools, which is enough to meet the needs. The club's purpose is to promote civilian interest in aviation and, in practical terms, to cultivate aviation talent in a relatively economical and simple way. This organization, on the one hand, is to implement flight training technology and reserve aircraft pilots for the country, and on the other hand, because it is a civilian organization, with no military relationship, it can be open so that the public can visit at any time, in order to promote social aviation knowledge.</p>
<p>Declaration</p>
<p>Dear compatriots, today is the National Day celebrating the 24th anniversary of the founding of the country. Today, when the whole country is enthusiastically participating in the 6th National Games, our club was born in such a warm mood in order to meet the needs of the times. It is not only the beginning of civil aviation career flight skill talent training in China, but also symbolizes the germination of a new life of the Chinese nation. From then on, it will continue to grow, not only the development of China's civil aviation career will be unlimited, but also the revival of the Chinese nation can be realized. In terms of the times, the aviation career has become the career of the times in the 24th century. In European and American countries, there is not much difference between people's investment in the aviation career and those engaged in aviation education. However, aviation industry and aviation education in our country are limited to government-run and military use. Before 1931, there was no civil aviation career construction in China. After 1923, the public felt the deepening national crisis and the pressing foreign troubles. Knowing that it is not enough to survive without concentrating the power of the whole country to develop the national aviation career, Shanghai had the establishment of the China Aviation Association. However, at that time, the China Aviation Association was still doing the initial work of developing the aviation career, only focusing on publicity to awaken the public's attention to aviation. Since 1934, due to the hard work of the host, the club affairs have been listed as progress, and the voice of developing aviation has promoted social thoughts. Xiang, Gan, Zhejiang, and Min aviation branches were established one after another at this time, and the construction of civil aviation careers in various provinces and cities was also promoted by this. Recently, in order to import aviation knowledge, aviation semi-monthly journals have been founded. If the period before 1934 was the publicity period for China's civil aviation careers, then after 1934, it should be the construction period for China's civil aviation careers. The progress of China's civil aviation careers has gone from the theoretical stage to the implementation stage. The establishment of our club today is an official function of the China Aviation Association. Its purpose is to cultivate flight technical talents in accordance with the will of the China Aviation Association. Dear compatriots, the 20th century is the era of aviation, and flight skills are the latest skills of the 20th century. We are born in the 20th century and should have the skills of the era. Our club was established today for the needs of the times and the urging of society. We hope that all compatriots in the country will actively participate. Not only can individuals gain new academic knowledge, but the revival of the country and nation also depends deeply on the love of the compatriots. It must be known that the desire for national revival and national liberation cannot be achieved by empty words, nor can it be exchanged by iron and blood alone. In addition to iron and blood, there must be new knowledge and new skills to win the final victory. The establishment of our club is to instill sound aviation knowledge, cultivate excellent flight technology, and develop the national aviation career. We want to cover the sunshine on the Pacific Ocean with our planes. This is by no means a mysterious ideal. As long as we can work together to participate, even if it is an ideal, it will become a reality.</p>
<p>Sky Leaflets</p>
<p>It is also learned that the association specially made two kinds of leaflets in order to promote aviation to save the country. They were distributed in the sky above the sports field by the "Save the Country" and "Tianchu" aircraft during the opening ceremony of the National Games this morning. They are copied as follows: (1) Young people, the evolution of the times is constantly advancing. Aviation is the career of the 20th century. You all have strong physique and lofty ambitions. Please don't miss the opportunity. Please join the new era of aerial sports. The purpose of our club is: 1. Popularize aviation knowledge and skills. 2. Establish the fearless spirit of the people. 3. Cultivate the aviation atmosphere. 4. Promote the interest in flying, so as to develop the national aviation career. Aviation is the latest career in the 20th century. People born in the 20th century without aviation knowledge and skills are really letting down the times. Do you want to obtain full aviation knowledge and grasp the times? Please subscribe to the aviation semi-monthly journal. Do you want to obtain excellent flight technology and become a strong man of the times? Please join the Flying Club.</p>

<p>Xin Xin News Agency reports that since the Central Trust Bureau started its business on the first day of this month, because it is a trust institution specially established by the Central Bank with allocated funds, it is large in scale and deeply trusted by the society. A reporter from Xin Xin News Agency learned yesterday that the trust department, in order to protect the funds of public institutions or organizations, specially established fund trusts, which are divided into: (1) fund trust investment, (2) fund trust deposit, (3) collection of funds. Among them, fund trust deposits are guaranteed by the bureau for both principal and interest. The interest rate is 7% per week for a one-year term, and negotiable for more than one year. The depositor can also agree on a method of withdrawing interest in installments, and withdraw it on schedule with the interest book prepared by the bureau. Even non-local public welfare charities and educational institutions, because they believe that this deposit is safe and secure and the income is certain, have gone to the bureau to apply for opening accounts.</p>

The representatives requested: (1) to implement a 40% rent reduction; (2) to use all of the 40% reduction to provide disaster relief to save the people; (3) the 40% disaster relief is limited to three months, and after the expiration, the tenants will enjoy it to reduce the burden and wait for the market to reach a considerable prosperity before it is abolished. Hong agreed to forward it to the mayor for review. The representatives were satisfied and returned.</p>
<p>The federation convened a representative meeting of various districts at 2:00 PM yesterday afternoon. Chen Jiufeng, Zhang Xianfang, Chen Jicheng, Qiu Liangyu, and 59 other people attended. Chen Jicheng, Ao Kui, and Wang Jingdong were publicly elected as the presidium. First, Chen Jiufeng reported on the petition process. After discussion: (1) Reduce rent to help disaster relief, to reduce the burden on the citizens and save the disaster victims, it was resolved that: A, wait for the municipal government to reply, and actively prepare for implementation; B, submit a report to the Central Party Department's Executive Yuan Relief Committee to urge its realization; C, transfer the petition event to the Shanghai Municipal Rent Reduction Committee for handling. (2) National Day commemorative celebration method case, it was resolved that: notify the district branches to close and fly flags to celebrate.

<h3 id="e101">Taxpayers' Association and Seven Other Organizations Request Cancellation of Chinese Concession Telephone Fee <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>The Chinese Ratepayers Association of the Shanghai Public Concession, the National Federation of Commerce, the Bankers' Association, the Accountants' Association, the Money Dealers' Association, the Lawyers' Association, and the Citizens' Federation of the First Special District, wrote to the Public Works Department regarding the Chinese Concession telephone fee, requesting an immediate cancellation to benefit users. The original text reads: "The telephone must be smooth, fast, simple, and convenient. The Shanghai Telephone Bureau specially set up a call fee for calls between users of the Shanghai Telephone Bureau and Shanghai Telephone Company, making it difficult to fulfill the above requirements, causing significant losses to users for several years. In addition, there is no strict technical distinction between users and non-users, so that users may not be liable for usage fees, while non-users are burdened with obligations, which is unreasonable in law and in fact. In short, the cancellation of this call fee is the unanimous demand of users. The Shanghai Telephone Bureau has long been prepared to cancel this call fee due to the above reasons. (Xin Sheng News Agency reporter noted that the telephone company charges the bureau 3 cents each time a phone call is made from the Chinese boundary to the concession, and the telephone bureau charges 2 cents each time a phone call is made from the concession to the Chinese boundary. They settle with each other at the end of the month, and both parties charge users 5 cents each time. The telephone bureau has stipulated this year that residents can make 20 calls to the concession per month, and stores can make 40 calls. Over the limit, they will be charged, and they have negotiated with the telephone company to cancel the call fee at the same time, but there has been no result.) However, the telephone company is selfish and ignores the purpose of public use. It does not cooperate to cancel this call fee, so the Shanghai Telephone Bureau's goodwill cannot be realized. At the moment when telephone experts are studying, the bureau should immediately cancel this call fee and hand it over for study in order to realize the above requirements and not lose the purpose of public use. This is what we all feel."</p>

<h3 id="e102">Shortcomings of the Telephone Company: Fan Fengyuan Lists Nine Points; Taxpayers' Association Transfers to the Public Works Department <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Concession Ratepayers Association wrote to the acting director of the Public Works Department, Fei Lipu, yesterday, saying: "We are now sending you a letter from Fan Fengyuan, a telephone professor at the China Wireless Electricity Engineering School, which is copied below. Please forward it to the Telephone Expert Committee for reference. 'Since the Shanghai Telephone Company intends to adopt charging by the number of times due to insufficient income and expenditure, Shanghai users are all alarmed and opposed. There are many reasons for this, not because charging by the number of times is unreasonable, but because charging by the number of times increases the burden on users. Now, please list the situation of the Shanghai Telephone Company and the opposition of all parties as follows: (1) Since 1930, the Shanghai Telephone Company began to convert all telephone engineering to automatic machines, but instead of adopting the "Struggle-Style", which is the most common and economical in the world, it adopted the "Seven-Love Style", resulting in extremely high maintenance costs. The telephone industry believes that this is a mistake made by the Shanghai Telephone Company when it founded the automatic machine. (2) The Shanghai Telephone Company purchases materials once, which are supplied by the China Electrical Company, a Chinese subsidiary of the International Telephone Trust, stipulating in the contract that the China Electrical Company will extract a 5% commission from it. Most of the components are purchased from the United States at a very high price. The monthly rate is calculated at one US dollar for five national currency, which makes the price of machines and materials purchased by the Shanghai Telephone Company more than twice the market price. (3) The Shanghai Telephone Company must also purchase materials that can be purchased in Shanghai immediately, such as screws and wires, which are very easy to purchase and very cheap in Shanghai, from the China Electrical Company at high prices. Moreover, knowing that the China Electrical Company also buys them locally at low prices and sells them at high prices, the Shanghai Telephone Company silently accepts it without saying a word. We believe that the above facts are the darkness of the inside story of the Shanghai Telephone Company. (4) The Seven-Love-style automatic machine has many relays. Each time a call is connected, multiple relays work at the same time in the automatic connection. As the number of operations increases, the relay spring contact point is easily damaged. The Shanghai Telephone Company's equipment has not provided precise protection, resulting in the damage and replacement of the spring becoming the largest unexpected loss on the monthly expenditure. (5) The Shanghai Telephone Company should not place unnecessary and huge underground cables in open and remote areas and in areas where roads are being built beyond the boundary. This kind of extravagance and waste is very costly, and it may not be beneficial to the company's business, even in the near future. The above two points are the lack of equipment and the error in planning of the Shanghai Telephone Company. (6) Since October 1933, the Shanghai Telephone Company has begun to implement a austerity policy and has reduced staff several times. Although more than 2,000 people have been laid off so far, all those laid off are temporary workers with low salaries, and the financial effect is very small. The salaries of foreign personnel are all above 400 yuan. Even if there is no achievement in the work, they are excused by the contract and have not been reduced. (7) Although the Shanghai Telephone Company has economic difficulties, it still hires people introduced by the Public Works Department regardless of experience. (8) The Shanghai Telephone Company violates the interests of users and hinders calls between users of the two telephone organizations. This is an undeniable fact. (9) The Shanghai Telephone Company's charging method is the most unreasonable. When it is installed, it charges an installation fee, and it should not force users to pay a monthly fee in advance. Since it is charged by the number of times, it should be based on a certain month as a unit, and it should not be from a certain day of a certain month. This kind of calculation is absolutely inconvenient and is hated by users. What is even more hateful is that users of the two telephone organizations have to pay a fee for each call, and the number of times recorded on the bill is mostly inconsistent with the actual number of times used. The charging method of the company according to the number of times, all of the above are the bad behavior and improper handling of the Shanghai Telephone Company. The Shanghai Telephone Company, because it has been allowed by the Public Works Department to obtain an annual interest rate of 8% and a public bond of 2%, the Public Works Department never inspects the internal administrative accounting expenses of the Shanghai Telephone Company, only relying on the contract as the principle, which makes the undue expenses and improper losses of the Shanghai Telephone Company all the burden of the telephone users in the Shanghai Concession. This method is too unreasonable. Therefore, telephone users, under the wrong basic principle, will inevitably oppose the increase in monthly fees or the change to charging by the number of times. Since this telephone price increase storm, the number of residential users who have removed their telephones is more than 2,000. The telephone traffic depends on the increase in the number of users. The reduction in the number of users reduces the application efficiency of the telephone. The Shanghai Telephone Company believes that the concession users can be squeezed as much as possible by the contract allowed by the Public Works Department, but it does not know that the effect of this squeeze is just the opposite. The market is sluggish, and merchants are at risk of bankruptcy. The increase in telephone charges is really beyond the burden of our users. Therefore, the Shanghai Concession Taxpayers Association should argue on the basis of reason, oppose the price increase, and abolish the method of charging by the number of times. On the one hand, it requires the Public Works Department to inspect the financial expenses of the Shanghai Telephone Company to ensure that the internal organization is complete, the expenditure is reasonable, and the plan is improved. Then, no matter how the charges are collected, it will definitely be possible to obtain a profit of 10% every year.'" This is addressed to Fei, the acting director of the Shanghai Public Concession Public Works Department.</p>
<h3 id="e103">Various District Rent Reduction Associations to Launch a General Mobilization Tomorrow, Issue a Second Declaration, and Seek Opinions from All Sectors <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Various District Rent Reduction Association, since the establishment of its various district committees, has been working intensely internally. As the date of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee is approaching, it issued a second declaration yesterday, and sent letters to various sectors soliciting opinions. It also notified various businesses and residents to sign and affix their seals on the presented petitions in preparation for petitioning in the capital. It is also reported that a general mobilization will be launched starting from the 11th of this month. Excerpts from its declaration and solicitation of opinions are recorded below:</p>
<p>Second Declaration</p>
<p>Upon investigation, our Shanghai municipality, since the global economic depression spread around the world, has led to the decline of all industries and economic bankruptcy, reaching a point of exhaustion. However, rent prices have increased instead of decreasing. The 3.6 million citizens all feel overwhelmed by the burden. It is unnecessary to elaborate. We believe that to avoid suffering, it is essential to make sincere requests to landlords to reduce rent prices. Recognizing this, we formed a rent reduction association to awaken those oppressed by high rent prices to rise up together and launch a city-wide rent reduction movement, in order to save ourselves from danger and revive the market. We have been running around and appealing, struggling hard, and continuing our efforts without slackening. Although there are those who understand the greater good and consider the social environment and voluntarily reduce rents, many greedy landowners only know how to seek profit and disregard the overall situation. As a result, the goal of rent reduction has not been widely achieved. If this continues, not only will individual households face unforeseen circumstances due to being unable to bear the burden, but the realization of a prosperous market will never be seen. Considering this, our association has decided to hold a general mobilization at 9:00 AM on the 11th of this month, sending representatives to various streets to request signatures and seals from various shops and residents, preparing to petition the Sixth Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee, hoping that rent reduction standards will be promulgated as soon as possible, so that the goal of rent reduction can be achieved soon. In this way, our suffering can be alleviated, and our danger can be averted. We hope that all residents of the city will rise up, respond unanimously, and provide assistance to fulfill the purpose of ensuring the livelihood of citizens and restoring the prosperity of the market. Society has high hopes. This is our declaration.</p>
<p>Solicitation of Opinions</p>
<p>To all Shanghai municipal organizations, schools, and groups: In recent years, Shanghai has been affected by the global economic depression, leading to the collapse of industry and commerce, the decline of all trades, and a sharp downturn in the market. However, rent remains high. All citizens of the port city feel overwhelmed by the burden. It is truly necessary to request landlords to reduce rent prices in order to make adjustments. Recognizing this, we formed the Rent Reduction Committee to reduce the burden on citizens, revive the market, and save ourselves from danger. We have used righteous arguments to awaken real estate merchants, so that they understand the principle of coexistence and co-prosperity. However, since our establishment, we have been running around and appealing, struggling hard, and continuing our efforts without stopping. Although there are some landlords who understand the greater good and consider the social environment and voluntarily reduce rents, many greedy landlords only know how to seek profit and are ignorant of the overall situation. Our association believes that this matter is of great importance, and without the cooperation of the entire city, we will ultimately be unable to reach everyone. We have long admired your organizations, groups, and schools for your enthusiasm for local public welfare, and the issue of rent reduction is closely related to your organizations. Therefore, we are sending this notice, earnestly requesting your assistance and hoping that you will provide guidance and strategies to facilitate progress and achieve the goal of widespread rent reduction throughout the city. We also hope to receive a response.</p>
<p>Request for Signatures</p>
<p>Public Notice to all Businesses and Residents of the City: The current depression in the market and the decline of industry and commerce have reached an extreme point. Banks are collapsing, land prices are plummeting, and the general public lacks purchasing power. However, rent prices have increased instead of decreasing, causing the general public to be unable to bear the burden. Therefore, we have initiated and organized the Rent Reduction Association to implement rent reduction and ease the burden on citizens, so that we can save ourselves from the crisis and revive the market. In the past two years, although some have voluntarily reduced rent, it has not been widespread throughout the city. Now, our Rent Reduction Association is preparing to petition the Sixth Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee, hoping to achieve the goal of rent reduction. Therefore, we are launching a general mobilization today, sending representatives to various streets to request signatures and seals from various businesses and residents to strengthen the power of our petition. We hope that everyone will first understand the meaning of the rent reduction movement. Directly, it is to reduce the burden on citizens. Indirectly, it is to save ourselves from the crisis and revive the market. In the current situation, it is a necessary movement. We hope that everyone will rise up and respond. Also, it is reported that Wang Yunfu and others, permanent committee members of the Yugang Branch of the Zhabei District Rent Reduction Committee on Guoqing Road, have spared no effort in rent reduction work, requesting landlords to reduce rent prices on behalf of all single tenants. After repeated negotiations, they have obtained the landlord's commitment to voluntarily reduce the rent for each city-style house by five yuan and each shikumen house by eight yuan. It is reported that the branch has already reported to the district committee and forwarded it to the joint association yesterday.</p>
<h3 id="e104">Strict Enforcement of Smoking Eradication: Public Security Bureau Issues Certificates, Each Household Must Obtain a Guarantee from Two Landlords, Guaranteeing that the Household Has No Traces of Smokers <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Public Security Bureau believes that the city's population is dense and mixed, and although the registration of smokers is conducted by the police stations of various branches, due to the large number of households, omissions are inevitable. In order to conduct a thorough investigation and prevent future troubles, the bureau has formulated measures for resident certificates and decided to implement them. Each household must obtain a guarantee from two landlords, certifying that the residents of the household have no traces of smokers. The bureau has now issued resident certificate forms, which have been handed over to various branch bureaus for printing and distribution to police officers, ordering them to have each resident fill them out and report them for investigation, and to strictly enforce them. The Linping Road Police Station and others have already implemented this. According to the station's report to the bureau, more than 9,300 guarantees have been issued by residents under its jurisdiction, and the results have been quite satisfactory. Other branch bureaus are also actively ordering all residents within their jurisdictions to complete the guarantee procedures as soon as possible.</p>
<h3 id="e105">The Board of Directors of Dahua Bank Decides to Suspend Business and Liquidate Tomorrow, Repaying Deposits of More Than 100,000 Yuan in Installments, Increasing Capital Cooperation, and Completing Resumption of Business at a Later Date <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>According to the New Voice News Agency, the board of directors of Dahua Commercial Savings Bank has decided to suspend business and liquidate starting tomorrow (the 11th), and to repay savings deposits in installments. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>The Process of Suspension</p>
<p>The New Voice News Agency has learned that the bank was established in September of the 22nd year of the Republic (1933) with a capital of 500,000 yuan. It initially operated on Shanxi Road and later moved to Nanjing Road last winter. Due to the unprecedented economic terror, most of the bank's deposits have been gradually withdrawn. The accounts receivable have also been difficult to recover due to market conditions. In light of this situation, the bank has been contacting various parties for cooperation in order to expand its capital. However, because the actual assets of the bank during its operation were difficult to estimate, cooperation has not been achieved. On the 29th of last month, the bank convened an extraordinary shareholders' meeting, which resolved to authorize the board of directors to handle the matter as appropriate and to earnestly pursue cooperation. Recently, the bank's board of directors unanimously agreed that continuing to delay would not only waste expenses but also prolong the suspension of cooperation, which was not a good strategy. Therefore, it was decided to temporarily suspend business starting on October 11th and entrust accountant Xu Yongzuo, Dong Yu, lawyer Lu Jiazi, and lawyer Dai Jinghuai to handle the liquidation and earnestly pursue the accounts receivable.</p>
<p>Repaying Deposits</p>
<p>It is reported that the bank owes creditors a total of more than 500,000 yuan. The amount owed in deposits is not large, totaling more than 18,000 yuan in commercial deposits and approximately 80,000 yuan in savings deposits. It has been decided to repay them separately as soon as possible. Starting from November 1st, demand deposits will be repaid. Starting from December 1st, fixed savings deposits of 1,000 yuan or less will be repaid. Starting from January 1st, fixed savings deposits of more than 1,000 yuan will be repaid. Starting from February 1st, current and fixed deposits in the commercial department will be repaid. It is expected that all deposits will be repaid in three months. Once the liquidation is completed and the assets are accurately estimated, cooperation will be carried out, capital will be expanded, and business will be resumed at a later date.</p>
<p>Notice of Suspension</p>
<p>Dahua Commercial Savings Bank Notice: This bank is now complying with the resolution of the extraordinary shareholders' meeting of September 29th. In order to increase reserves, consolidate credit, solicit cooperation, expand capital, and reorganize the bank to cope with the environment, we will temporarily suspend business starting on October 11th and entrust Dong Yu, Lu Jiazi, lawyer Dai Jinghuai, and accountant Xu Yongzuo to conduct the liquidation first. A liquidation office will be established. All demand deposits in this bank will be repaid in full starting on November 1st. Fixed deposits in the savings department with a balance of 1,000 yuan or less will be repaid starting on December 1st. Deposits with a balance of more than 1,000 yuan will be repaid starting on January 1st, 1936. Current deposits in the commercial department will be repaid starting on February 1st. All customers who owe this bank mortgage loans and overdrafts are requested to come to this bank's liquidation office within two weeks to settle their accounts clearly. If they fail to do so by the deadline, we will have no choice but to pursue them through legal channels and will no longer provide further notice. Once this bank is reorganized and expanded, we will resume business at a later date and publish it in the newspaper. We hope that all sectors will continue to support us at that time.</p>

<p>Xu Shunxing Wins the Bid, Approved by the Ministry of Railways, Bid Price 349,800 Yuan</p>
<p>The detailed plans and engineering drawings for the construction of the new office building for the Beijing-Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Two Railway Bureaus have been completed by the Engineering Department and submitted to the Ministry of Railways for approval. Starting from September 17th, the basement and housing parts were divided into two parts and separately tendered to contractors. The Ministry of Railways was requested to send personnel to supervise the bidding. As of September 30th, a total of 19 contractors submitted bids for the housing part, and 17 contractors submitted bids for the basement part. The public opening was held at 2:00 PM on the afternoon of the same day in the conference room of the bureau. Zheng Kechang Hua, representative of the Ministry of Railways, attended the meeting to supervise. As a result, Xu Shunxing's bid price of 297,000 yuan was the lowest for the housing part, and Yugenji's price of 32,062 yuan was the lowest for the C type (wooden pile) of the basement part. Xu Shunxing ranked 13th, with a bid price of 52,800 yuan. In order to facilitate the management of this project and to ensure responsibility, the bureau decided to award both the basement and housing parts to one contractor. After investigation, only Xu Shunxing and Kangyi Foreign Company had inventory and did not need to order from foreign countries for the basement part. Kangyi Foreign Company's bid price for the basement part was 48,700 yuan, only 4,100 yuan higher than Xu Shunxing's. However, the total bid price for Xu Shunxing's housing and basement parts was 349,800 yuan, which was still the lowest. Therefore, it was proposed to award the entire project to Xu Shunxing, which has been approved by the Ministry of Railways. The construction of fences at the new office site began yesterday in order to start construction.</p>

<p>Gu Zhuxuan, the owner of Tianchan Stage, who was arrested for allegedly being involved in the assassination of Tang Jiapeng, the former manager of the Great World Amusement Park, has been interrogated three times by the Second Special District Court. Because he expressed his willingness to declare in court that he was suffering from a disease, he was temporarily sent to Guangci Hospital on Jin Shenfu Road for treatment. The court, considering the importance of the case, specially invited a well-known mental illness expert from this port, a German doctor, to join the court's medical officer in going to Guangci Hospital a few days ago to conduct a detailed examination of Gu, to determine the matter. The details have been recorded in this newspaper. It is now learned that the two doctors have completed the examination, and the report has been completed and is waiting for translation before being submitted to the court. As for when this case can be heard again, it is said that the court will notify the police station two hours before the arraignment as a precaution.</p>
<h3 id="e114">Municipal Chamber of Commerce Instructions: Doubts about Stamping Invoices <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday replied to the Shanghai Electric Pole Material Company and the Far East Oil Company, instructing on the meaning of stamping invoices. The original letter said: "We received your letter of the 8th of this month, and we have read the attached invoice samples. Article 16 of the Stamp Tax Law and the rate table stipulate that invoices, receipts, and bills each have their own respective uses, so it is stipulated that they must all be stamped. Many merchants have inquired, saying that if there is an invoice for delivery and a receipt for payment, it is close to duplication to stamp the bill again, which raises doubts. The third clause of the bill refers to merchants who do not trade in cash, but agree to pay at the end of the month, and when the due date is approaching, they open the name, quantity, and price of the goods, asking them to prepare for payment when the due date arrives. It is different in nature from a receipt for simple payment, so they must be stamped separately. When a merchant receives payment, if he immediately writes the word 'received' on the bill, according to Article 8 of the Stamp Tax Law, he may not need to stamp it separately. If he issues a separate receipt, then it is an independent monetary voucher and must be stamped separately. All of these situations can be considered by the merchants themselves. As for the bill in the third clause of Article 6, since it refers to non-cash transactions and agreed payment dates, if it is not paid by the due date, and a bill is re-issued in the next month or next quarter, this is the so-called reminder bill. If there was a detailed bill last month, there will be no need to open a detailed account later. This is what is meant by the eighth clause of Article 3 of the Stamp Tax Law as a reminder bill. Suppose a certain amount was paid last month or last quarter, and a certain amount is still owed, then the outstanding amount listed in the bill is the reconciliation amount bill mentioned in the eighth clause of Article 3. The bills attached to your letter are all recent transactions with agreed payment dates, opening the name, quantity, and price of the goods, asking them to prepare for payment when the due date arrives. They should be stamped according to the provisions of the third clause of Article 16 of the law."</p>

<p>—The Phrase "There's No Way" is Worth Studying—</p>
<p>Jin Dai, a woman from Jinhua, Zhejiang, residing at No. 459 North Henan Road, and her maid, Luo Guo, were suddenly broken into at 8:15 AM on the 23rd of last month and hacked to death with a hatchet. Hua Detective Shang Wu, Detective Zhao Qingkui, and Western Detective Yang of the Mixed Court Police Station had already apprehended the suspect, Luo Yusheng (formerly the General Affairs Director of Mingchen Elementary School on Xinqiao Road in the South City), and sent him to the First Special Court. The details of the two interrogations have been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon at 2:30 PM, Judge Liu Yugui specially opened the Eighth Criminal Court for interrogation, and many men and women</p>
<p>Filled the Courtroom</p>
<p>The courtroom was full. The defendant, Luo Yusheng, continued to retain three lawyers, including Xu Jie, to defend him. According to Police Station Lawyer Zhang Tianyin, during the adjournment, the police station had sent a pair of white trousers seized from the defendant's residence to the Lester Institute of Medical Research at No. 1320 Avenue Road for expert re-examination. The result showed that the red spots on the trousers were not bloodstains, but ordinary paint. The defendant's lawyer had presented</p>
<p>A Letter</p>
<p>During the previous court hearing. The letter was an anonymous letter sent to the defendant after his father, Luo Zhaoxin, was assassinated, pointing out that his father's murder was related to Zhang Rongsheng, who lived in Lane 1, South, Xin Xin Li, Jin Shenfu Road, in the French Concession. However, after Luo Zhaoxin's murder, the Old Zha Police Station had investigated Zhang's residence, but Zhang had already fled and had not yet been apprehended. Furthermore, after being detained, the defendant had led the detectives to the scene of the incident, pointing out the location and condition of the victims. Although the police station had found</p>
<p>Fingerprints in the Victim's Room</p>
<p>But it has now been verified that they are different from the defendant's fingerprints. There were also several shoeprints, but they were too blurred to be investigated. Although the defendant denied it in court, he confessed in the police station that he went to do it with Xu Wenxian and a Mr. Ma, who were on the run. At that time, the defendant was wearing white trousers and a black top. The white trousers and black trousers have now been found, but the black top has not been found after a thorough search. Yesterday, the defendant's uncle visited him at the police station and also instructed the defendant to</p>
<p>Tell the Truth</p>
<p>And explain the whole story. Whether he committed the murder or not. The defendant said that Xu and Ma had fled to Hangzhou and could not be found. Judge Liu then interrogated the defendant, who still vehemently denied it, saying, "Although I went to Jin Dai's house with the detectives, I saw two bloodstains on the floor. One was under the sofa, and one was a little further away. Judging from the situation, Jin Dai, as the owner, would naturally die on the sofa. Moreover, I always saw Jin</p>
<p>Sleeping on the Sofa</p>
<p>Etc." Judge Liu then carefully examined the seized black and white trousers and a pair of yellow leather shoes. Seeing stains on the edges of the leather shoes that did not seem to be yellow oil, he ordered the police station to investigate the leather shoes in detail. He then asked the defendant Luo Yusheng if the trousers and shoes were his. Luo only admitted that the white trousers were his, but denied that the black trousers and yellow leather shoes belonged to him. Suddenly, a</p>
<p>Female Spectator</p>
<p>Zhou Yiying (a classmate of the deceased Jin Dai's daughter, Jin Lingyi), claimed in court that at around 8 AM on the 23rd of last month, when she was going to the church school on Avenue Road in the French Concession, she saw the defendant riding a bicycle from south to north passing Qiao on Sichuan Road near Beijing Road. At that time, the defendant was wearing a long gown, but she could not remember the color. Because she often encountered the defendant when she went to Jin Lingyi's house to play, she recognized him. However, the defendant</p>
<p>Vehemently Denied</p>
<p>Claiming that from 8:45 AM to 9:45 AM that morning, he attended a memorial service at the school, which could be proven by teachers from the same school. At around 10 AM, he sent a radio to No. 14 Jiu An Li, Huang Jia Que Road. In the afternoon, at around 2 PM, he went to the Shanghai Bank to open his safe deposit box No. 1741 to withdraw 100 yuan for the school's urgent needs. He went to bed at 8 or 9 PM, etc. Finally, the defendant's uncle, Luo Zhaoxiu, submitted a statement that he was a lawyer practicing in Ningbo and the defendant was his nephew. Yesterday, he went to the police station to visit the defendant and asked about the case. The defendant only said "There's no way" and did not mention Xu and Ma going to Hangzhou. Judge Liu, believing that the case still required investigation, ordered Luo Yusheng to be remanded in custody and rescheduled the hearing for next Thursday morning.</p>

<p>The acetic acid industry has never been operated by Chinese. Acetic acid is an essential product for dyeing and weaving factories, leather factories, rayon factories, hospitals, and schools. Imports of foreign goods reach over one million yuan annually. Currently, the products sold in the market are German and Japanese goods. German goods are priced at about sixteen yuan per forty-four pounds, and Japanese goods are about fourteen yuan. The influx of these foreign goods in Shanghai is alarming. At a time when Chinese people are advocating industrial salvation, this acetic acid industry is a matter of urgency. It is learned that Shen Zhongyi, Zhang Rongchu, Xue Jimin, and other local industrial figures, in view of this, have specially initiated the establishment of the Jiangnan Chemical Industry Factory, specializing in the production of acetic acid, and also managing by-products such as wood spirit, asphalt, and charcoal. The factory is located at No. 1407 Gonghe Xin Road, Zhabei, and is equipped with the latest German Meyer dry distillation and distillation machines. All equipment was designed and drafted by Chief Engineer Xue Jimin, PhD, and supervised and constructed. Since preparations began last November, all machinery, equipment, and factory affairs have been arranged and production has begun. The percentage of acetic acid produced reaches 97-100, and its composition is higher than that of imported products. It is estimated that the daily output will be 3,000 pounds in the future, which can fulfill the responsibility of promoting domestic products and recovering leakage. This emerging industry independently operated by Chinese is the first of its kind in China, and its future development can be predicted. It is also heard that the factory plans to invite the local press to visit and provide guidance within the month.</p>

After a long preliminary hearing by Prosecutor Xie, he ordered the detention of Zhang Yu'an, Wang Yangqu, Wang Zhu, and other men and women, a total of eight people, for further investigation.</p>

<p>Li Chuanbin, a reporter for the Shanghai branch of the Central News Agency, was run over and killed by car No. 8497 on Hankou Road the day before yesterday. The body was examined at the Phelan Road morgue at 10 AM yesterday. Prosecutor Tang Buyou of the First Special District Court summoned Li Quewei, the driver of car No. 8497 and an inspector from the Public Works Department of the Public Concession, to inquire about the incident. Li Quewei admitted to driving the car, but attributed the cause to the rainy weather and slippery road. The prosecutor acknowledged that the rainy weather and slippery road were indeed facts, but questioned why only his car had an accident, indicating obvious negligence. However, since the defendant was British, the prosecutor instructed the family of the deceased to file a lawsuit in the British court. The family of the deceased immediately took the body and transported it to the Chinese Funeral Home on Haig Road for a grand coffin ceremony at 5:30 PM that afternoon. The family of the deceased is currently preparing legal procedures to file a lawsuit in the British court. It is also learned that Tao Jiacong, chairman of the Chinese Funeral Home, in view of Li's tragic death, has agreed to provide special discounts for funeral expenses.</p>

<p>The China Harmonica Society in this city will soon be five years old. Branches have spread throughout the country, with over 6,500 male and female members. The work done in the past, such as disaster relief, national salvation music conferences, performances for wounded soldiers, performances for bandit suppression soldiers, drought relief concerts, etc., has been excellent and commended by all sectors of society. November 16th of this year is the fifth anniversary of the society's founding.

All proceeds will be used to help disaster relief in various provinces. It is now heard that President Wang has received letters from various branches expressing their agreement and actively preparing to hold it together.

<p>(1) On the top floor of the house of landlord Lu Shi, No. 2 Haiyun Fang, Qinglian Street in this city, which was subleased to tenant Yang, at 3 PM the day before yesterday, Zhang Xiangsheng, 37 years old, from Liuhe, who lived at No. 12 Taian Li, outside the West Gate, went to Yang's house for a chat. At that time, police officers dispatched by the local police station came to inquire about opium smokers in the house at No. 2. Unexpectedly, when Zhang Xiangsheng suddenly heard the sound of the police officers' leather shoes downstairs, he panicked and, without considering anything, climbed over the window to escape, jumping onto the glass canopy. The glass broke, and Zhang fell from a height, injuring his head. He was immediately sent to Shanghai Hospital for treatment but died at 8:10 PM in the hospital. Yesterday afternoon, Jiang Pingyang, the head of the Ninth Pudi District, reported to the local court for investigation.

<p>The Yongtai Cigarette Factory distribution office at No. 326 Henan Road has not paid cigarette tax on the cigars it has sold over the years. It was only recently discovered that the country has lost more than 26,900 yuan in taxes. In addition, the store's books also lacked many stamp duties. The Public Works Department has reported this to the First Special District Local Court. The manager of the store, Zheng Yongyu, failed to appear in court after being summoned. Yesterday morning, the court continued to open, and Zheng still did not appear. A lawyer represented him in court to defend him. Zhang Mengrong, an official from the Shanghai Concession Cigarette Office of the Tax Administration of the Ministry of Finance, also appeared in court and presented the Cigarette Tax Regulations. After Judge Zhan Liangce examined the evidence, he announced the verdict and fined the defendant 54,000 yuan. This case is the record amount for a penalty for evading national tax.</p>
<p>On the way, a car suddenly drove forward from behind on West Sports Association Road, knocking her down and crushing her head, killing her instantly. The driver of the accident did not stop to help, but instead sped away at full speed, disappearing in an instant, making it impossible to investigate the license plate number. The local police station ordered Shen Xuxiang, the 93rd district land guard of the Gongwan District, to report to the local court for investigation. (3) Furthermore, a local woman, Shen Peng, 32 years old, lived at the north end of the Central Mint in Zhujiawan. Because her family was poor and could not make ends meet, she developed thoughts of ending her life. The night before last, she secretly ingested opium and committed suicide. By yesterday morning, her family discovered it and tried to save her, but it was too late. The matter was discovered by the Tanziwan Police Station, who feared there might be other circumstances. In addition to dispatching police to prevent the coffin from being sealed, they immediately ordered Guan Shucheng, the land guard of the 22nd district, to report to the court for investigation. (4) Furthermore, Chen Shaoting, 57 years old, a resident of the Yongxing Hotel on Xinjiang Road, Zhabei, was from Yangzhou. He used to run a pharmacy in Kaibei. After the January 28th Incident, his business plummeted and could not be sustained. He closed the store and lived off his savings, making life increasingly difficult. All his clothes, utensils, and business assets were gradually sold off. He was unable to pay his rent, and as a result, the landlord evicted him. Chen had no face to return to his hometown, so he stayed at the Yongxing Inn on Xinjiang Road, borrowing to survive. The day before yesterday, he suddenly died. The innkeeper, Zhang Yongfa, notified Chen's wife, Zhang (who worked as a helper in someone's house), to come and hastily coffin Chen. The matter was discovered by the Mongolia Road Police, who, because it had not been reported what illness Chen had died of, was suspicious. They ordered the police to detain the coffin temporarily in the inn and ordered land guard Yan Liugen to report to the court to open the coffin for inspection. (5) Furthermore, Tan Chen, 35 years old, a woman from Yangzhou residing at No. 23 Ningan Fang, North Zhejiang Road, had a son who was ten years old. She had an affair with Wei Alin, a porter at the North Railway Station. However, Wei was extremely stingy, and he only gave her and her son a dime a day for living expenses. As a result, she was in dire straits and wished she were dead. The day before yesterday, she secretly ingested opium and committed suicide. Yesterday, the local land guard reported to the court for investigation. At the same time, the Railway Police Bureau detained Wei Alin. After receiving the reports, the Procuratorate of the Local Court dispatched Prosecutor Zhao Chuanjia, accompanied by Investigator Shen, to investigate the above five cases separately in the afternoon.</p>

<p>Around 7 PM on the 5th of this month, at the Lin Family Garden, about one Chinese mile northeast of the Pengpu Town Police Branch, which belongs to the Xinzha Branch of Zhabei, an additional police officer named Liu Qingchen had his pistol stolen by three bandits, who also injured the back of his head. This has been reported in the newspapers. It is now learned that the stolen pistol's number is 28668, and the gun contained four bullets. After being escorted to the Xinzha Branch by the Pengpu Town Police Station, the officer claimed during interrogation that when he was on duty that night, his colleague, an additional police officer Fang, went out to fetch tea. Suddenly, three bandits came, all speaking the Jiangbei dialect. One bandit wearing blue cloth shorts and pants aimed a box cannon at his chest. Another bandit in blue cloth shorts and pants also held a box cannon and挟住him, and挾至 him near the wall about twenty steps inside the gate of the garden. They told him to be nice and robbed the pistol he was wearing on his waist. A bandit wearing a black褂 struck him several times on the back of the head, and the bandits then escaped over the wall. Later, it was learned that Officer Fang who was on duty had gone out to fetch tea for less than five minutes. The老虎灶 was very close. Upon hearing the police whistle, Officer Fang rushed back. He initially suspected that someone was fighting. Unexpectedly, Officer Liu reported that his pistol had been robbed by bandits. Furthermore, the garden owner and workers claimed that the officer's behavior was extremely bad, and he often borrowed money from people. Almost everyone in the garden had been borrowed from. If they did not grant his wishes, he would often create trouble, so everyone feared him. After investigating the wall, it was found to be as white as ever, with no traces of anyone climbing over it, nor were there any bricks or stones that had struck the officer. Therefore, the officer was suspected of being heavily involved in the case. After receiving the report, Chief Liao, in addition to reporting the situation to the Inspection Department of the Public Security Bureau, prepared a document yesterday and transferred the officer to the Third Section for disposal.</p>

<p>The steamer traveling from Lake to Shanghai encountered robbers at night. Five robbers, losses of over six hundred yuan.</p>
<p>The Gongxin Steamer of the Zhengchang Shipping Company on the South Bank of Pintang Lane, which travels the inland river Shanghai-Lake route, was robbed again on the night of the 8th while traveling from Huzhou to Shanghai, near the Ye Chenghuang Temple on the border of Jiangsu and Zhejiang. Losses totaled about six hundred yuan. The Datong News Agency reporter has investigated the situation as follows:</p>
<p>Robbed Mid-Journey</p>
<p>The Zhengchang Inland River Shipping Company has two steamers, Gongxin and Hejing, which travel daily between Shanghai and Lake on even-numbered dates of the lunar calendar. At noon on the 8th, the company's Gongxin steamer sailed from Lake to Shanghai as usual. At around 10 PM that night, when the ship was near the Ye Chenghuang Temple on the border of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, a boat suddenly came towards it. The steamer sounded its horn to tell it to move aside, but it ignored the warning. When it got closer, the boat suddenly fired three shots, ordering the steamer to stop. The steamer owner, forced by the use of force, had to stop. The robbers then swarmed onto the steamer. The five robbers were all wearing blue cloth short clothes and spoke with a Jiangbei accent. The accounting room, crew, and passengers were all searched one by one, and none were spared. After an hour, they took the stolen goods and sailed away.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of the Losses</p>
<p>After the robber boat left, the steamer dared to continue sailing. After inspecting the losses, it was found to be about six hundred yuan. Among them, a local national goods manufacturer, who had participated in the National Exhibition in Huzhou, had dispatched an employee on the steamer to deliver the 300 yuan in silver dollars that had been earned to Shanghai for accounting. The money was all robbed. At the same time, the steamer's accounting room was robbed of 50 yuan in cash. In addition, there were jewelry, clothes, etc., from passengers. Several passengers, frustrated that they had nothing on them to be searched, angrily took off their shoes and socks. After arriving in Shanghai yesterday, the steamer reported the robbery to the Inland River Shipping Industry Association, requesting them to telegraph the provincial authorities to order strict investigations of the robbers. It was also learned that the company's Hejing steamer, which was sailing from Shanghai to Lake the day before yesterday, had also passed through the area when the Gongxin steamer was being robbed. Fortunately, the owner was quick-witted and accelerated the horsepower to speed past, avoiding being robbed as well.</p>

<p>The eighty-fourth batch of overseas Chinese expelled from Japan, Yao Chenggu, Zhou Yaoshan, Zhou Shiman, Wang Zhanglong, Xu Hairen, Wu Chunman, Zhu Zhongxing, Liu Yuting, Ruan Guinan, Ni Xiti (all from Qingtian County, Zhejiang), Lin Fuhan (from Wenzhou, Zhejiang), Hu Yuming, Zhu Lianda, and Liu Buxing (from Ruian, Zhejiang), a total of fourteen people, were escorted from Tokyo and Nagoya on the Japanese mail ship Asu Maru to Shanghai at 1 PM yesterday. They stayed at the Laogongxin Inn in Shiliupu. According to the Nanqiao reporter, most of them were coal mining coolies in Japan. On September 30th, they were detained by Japanese police for four days, and all the money on their bodies was confiscated, leaving only their return tickets. Therefore, they arrived in Shanghai this time penniless, and they have no way to raise money to return to their hometowns. Today is also National Day, and the Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau and the Municipal Public Security Bureau are closed for business, so there is no way to appeal. They feel very much in a dilemma.</p>

<p>Gong Ziqing, a comprador from Wuxi working for Tianli Foreign Firm on Beijing Road and residing at No. 78 Yalu Road, who runs an iron shop at No. 376 North Suzhou Road, was recently targeted by a criminal gang. Between the 25th of last month and the 1st of this month, he received two threatening letters demanding a ransom of 2,000 yuan with Yuan Shikai's head printed on them, along with a bullet. He eventually agreed to pay 250 silver dollars. At 6:30 PM on the same afternoon, Zhang Yunlong from Chongming brazenly hired a car and went to Gong’s residence with a letter and a receipt, openly collecting the money. He was arrested by Zhou Yushan, a Chinese detective from the Jiaxing Road Police Station, and taken to the police station before being handed over to the First Special District Court for interrogation. The main culprit is a fugitive surnamed Shen, who is also the person who had the letter written. Following instructions, the case was postponed for a thorough investigation, and the defendant was detained. Yesterday morning, Judge Xiao Bian of the Criminal Tribunal No. 3 continued the trial. Li Zhishan, a lawyer from the Public Works Department, stated that the suspect surnamed Shen could not be apprehended during the postponement. The defendant claimed that his mother lived on Ximen Xieqiao Road, but attempts to arrest her there were unsuccessful. He confessed that Shen had first taken him near the victim's house to identify it, and that he had then hired a car at the entrance of the Red House Hospital (i.e., the Women and Children's Hospital) in Ximen, giving the letters and receipts to the driver to collect the silver. The case was requested to be postponed again. After questioning the defendant, Judge Xiao found that his confession was consistent with the previous one. He ordered the defendant to be remanded in custody for further investigation.</p>

<p>Yu Yangting, a native of Shaoxing County and the owner of the Chongyang Silk Weaving Factory on Xiaoshadu Road in West Shanghai, residing at No. 76 Wuding Lane, Wuding Road, suddenly received an extortion letter delivered by a criminal gang on the 3rd of this month. The letter was signed by Dai Rongquan, who claimed that Yu was his fellow villager and requested to "borrow" 600 yuan. The letter stated that if the money was not lent, then Yu's life would be "borrowed," and a meeting was arranged at Yinxiang Port. The messenger was wearing a large hat and uniform, carrying four bottles of Tiger Bone Wine with the money wrapped at the bottom with a rope. Someone would come to negotiate. The letter also included a bullet. After receiving the letter, Yu reported the situation to the Gordon Road Police Station, which dispatched Chinese detectives Tao Afu and Gao Huixian to keep watch. No trace of the criminals was found. By the 6th, Yu received another letter from the gang, accusing Yu of breaking the previous appointment, resulting in significant losses. If he failed to comply this time, they would resort to "considerable means." Another meeting was arranged at the Yangshupu bus station. Yu's brother, Yu Zhuting, acted as a representative, accompanied by detectives. They waited at the agreed location yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM. Until after 5:00 PM, a gangster named He Zhixiang from Shaoxing approached Yu Zhuting to negotiate, and he was immediately apprehended by the detectives. At that time, two other accomplices saw He being arrested and fled. The detectives caught Jiang Boting, also from Shaoxing, while the other gangster escaped. He and Jiang were taken back to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, they were handed over to the First District Court. The police station lawyer, Zhang Tianyin, in addition to prosecuting them under Article 346, Paragraph 3 of the Criminal Law, requested a postponement to apprehend the accomplices and investigate other cases.

<h3 id="e147">National Day Closing Causes Short Squeeze, Standard Gold Price Continues to Rise by $11.50 <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>After the gold market broke through the 900 yuan mark before the previous close, sentiment remained strong yesterday. There was a sense of a short squeeze in the market. Furthermore, due to the absence of a market on Wednesday afternoon and the National Day holiday, once buying momentum was triggered, sellers were even more constrained. In the end, the market broke through the 910 yuan mark.</p>
<p>Early in the morning, overseas silver markets saw a decline in British silver and stability in American silver. Speculation arose that India would purchase forward silver at a price 0.0625 above the listed price after the market closed. The rise and fall of forward silver prices in Montreux were significant, and the exchange rate was slightly higher across the board. London spot gold fell by two pence, and sentiment was stable.</p>
<p>Pre-market grey market trading opened at 0.23 yuan, then dropped to around 0.01 yuan. Fuxing, Yonghui, Xiangda, Dadecheng, Hongkang, Yongli, and Laijin pushed the price up to over 0.05 yuan. The Central Bank's official exchange rates were announced, with both British and American exchange rates remaining unchanged, and the customs gold unit rate showing no strength. The listed price for standard gold was lowered to 916.4 yuan, stabilizing slightly.</p>
<p>After the opening, demand and supply varied, with prices initially rising and then falling, but buying was generally stronger, leading to a gradual increase. HSBC and others took advantage of the high prices to sell, and sellers were active at high levels, gradually moving downstream, causing a temporary weakening. However, daily replenishment purchases were made. It was anticipated that HSBC's exchange rates would show a decline of 0.125 for British currency and 0.1875 for American currency. Subsequently, prices continued to rise, but as the Hong Kong market softened, large players also came to sell, leading to repeated rises and falls. Ultimately, due to positive sentiment, demand exceeded supply, allowing the market to be sustained.</p>
<p>As the short squeeze intensified, buying interest became even stronger. Due to the upcoming holiday, general short positions chased the rising market, causing sellers to be constrained and sentiment to become tense. It was predicted that Indian silver would decline by four annas, but instead, the price broke through the 10 yuan mark. Although many took advantage of the high prices to sell, there were also many who seized the opportunity to buy. The closing price remained above 10 yuan, and remained firm afterwards. This was due to the upcoming closure. The market conditions for the half-day session are recorded below.</p>

Dada, Futai, Yonghui, Xiang Fuyu all bought, pushing the price up to 7.2 yuan.

<p>The Hong Kong market hardened, and Shanghai sold British shillings. Hengyu, Zhongfeng, Huixiangyong, Yonglifeng, Yifeng, Yongtong, and Taichang jointly supplied, causing the price to fall to 4.4 yuan. Dadecheng, Chunyuan, Yongshun, Mao Tianfeng, and Dafa Yongwanfeng took advantage of the low prices to replenish their positions, causing the price to rise again to 8.2 yuan. Although Hengyu and Dada sold at 7.2 yuan, Dafa, Yongtianfeng, Wanfeng Hongyu advanced again to 8.3 yuan. Chunyuan, Yongying, Feng Hengqian, Changxiang, Hengyu, Huixiang Tong, Taichang Dingkang all sold, causing the price to fall again to 6.2 yuan.

Yingxiang Hengyu, Yongli Fuxingyong took advantage of the high prices to supply at 0.091 yuan, Chunyuan Yongyuansheng Yongyicheng Renfayong Fuyu all advanced, pushing the price up to 0.09 yuan.

However, due to positive sentiment, it soon became difficult to close trades, and the rates changed to 1 shilling 6 pence 0.25 and 37.3125 yuan, which was 0.125 tighter for British currency and 0.1875 tighter for US currency compared to the previous close. The Central Bank's official exchange rates were announced, with British and American currencies remaining unchanged, and the customs gold unit rate also unchanged, having little impact.</p>
<p>After the opening, the market trended towards complexity, but there were still reversals due to HSBC and others selling. It was anticipated that HSBC's exchange rates would show a decline of 0.125 for British currency and 0.1875 for American currency. Subsequently, banks rushed to close their positions, and tension remained. The Hong Kong market reported easing, and Chinese merchants were selling, resulting in fluctuations. Unable to resist the positive sentiment, it was predicted that Indian silver would decline by four annas, and in the end, it gathered again. The midday closing selling price for the near-term was 1 shilling 6 pence 0.1875 for British currency, and 37.1875 yuan for US currency, which was 0.1875 tighter for British currency and 0.3125 tighter for US currency compared to the previous close. Chinese merchants slightly settled a small number of shillings and sold 200,000 yuan in US dollars. Shanghai Xinfeng also sold, but banks were clearly covering their short positions. The day's trading record is listed below.</p>

<h3 id="e150">Bond Market Fluctuates, Near-Term Firm, Far-Term Weak, Difference Only 0.05, 0.10, 0.25 <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange, market conditions were uncertain. Market prices only fluctuated based on the supply and demand of call and put options for hedging between bulls and bears. However, position #48, with a large number of long positions, not only did not exit, but also added to their positions. Position #16, with short positions, slightly covered, which once sparked a rise in market prices. However, because positions #11 and #21, etc., continued to sell, whenever position #48 bought, various groups competed to sell, so market prices ultimately struggled to rise.</p>
<p>In this environment of unresolved rumors, it was difficult for the bulls to raise their heads. Domestic news circulated, and sentiment was also chaotic. Yesterday's developments showed a slightly firm opening, followed by a slightly weak one. The front and back ran counter to each other, with a difference of 0.05, 0.10 to 0.25. In the second round, the northern gang and position #21 sold, and market conditions weakened. The Disbandment Bonds for the far-term were down by 0.03, and the rest were down by 0.01-0.02 across the board. In the afternoon, position #48 suddenly increased their buying, pulling up the market again. The front series was slightly weak, and the back series had turned firm. The Salt Tax far-term suddenly rose by 0.03. Before the close, the front series was slightly firm, and the back series remained weak and unable to rise, with a tendency to circle. The final market prices also showed mixed rises and falls, mostly with the near-term rising but still weak. The total difference was only 0.05, 0.10 to 0.25. The 96 series remained unchanged at 10.57 yuan. The total number of transactions was 8,205,000 yuan. The results of the rises and falls are listed below for comparison (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan).</p>

<p>The yarn market was weak in the morning and recovered in the afternoon. New York cotton and the three grades of yarn and cotton both fell sharply. The standard yarn market was inevitably affected. However, in recent days, the existing stock of spot yarn has been depleted, and Sichuan and Guangdong merchants have unmet demand. Once the standard yarn market went below a certain price, there would be buying, and market prices fluctuated.</p>
<p>Golden Rooster Hovers</p>
<p>The morning market opened lower due to the decline in both foreign yarn and cotton, with prices falling by 0.08-0.09 across the board. In the second round, due to the Sichuan merchants purchasing spot yarn, the market rose by 0.04-0.05. In the third round, due to selling by the bulls, prices returned to the opening levels. As a result, prices fell by 0.06-0.09 compared to the previous day's closing prices. In the afternoon, the news of currency system favored the bulls, pushing prices up by around 1 yuan. As a result, the prices were similar to yesterday's closing prices, with rises and falls of 0.01-0.07.</p>

<p>The cotton market in the morning saw disappointment as the American cotton estimates were similar to the previous ones, and prices fell. However, the high gold prices and tight exchange rates, along with buying from a major player, caused prices to reverse and rise. In recent days, factory demand has been active, and export transactions have not been quiet. Tongyao cotton is being sold as soon as it arrives, and those in the industry are optimistic.</p>
<p>Zheng Biao Ends with Slight Increase</p>
<p>The morning market opened lower due to disappointing US cotton government estimates and a fall of around 1 yuan in the three grades of cotton. Prices fell by 0.015-0.035. In the second round, buying interest was slightly stronger, and prices rose by 0.01. After the third round, the bulls spat it out, and prices softened. As a result, prices fell by 0.015-0.02 compared to the previous day's closing. In the afternoon, news of currency system was favorable and a certain account vigorously entered the market. Closing prices rose by 0.025-0.035 compared to the morning, and results were largely similar to yesterday's prices.</p>

<p>Yesterday, American cotton opened higher, with prices up 2-5 points across the board. In the early morning, due to hedging sales and the absence of frost in the cotton-growing areas, market conditions were unstable. However, before the government report was released, manufacturers bought and short covering occurred, and market prices rose sharply. After the report was released, due to the larger-than-expected quantity, bulls settled, and hedging sales increased, causing market prices to weaken. Exports were not high, and the industry awaited developments abroad. Spot demand was calm, and local demand was firm. Textile activity was limited, and the closing was flat. Spot prices fell by 0.10 points, and futures prices fell by 0.10-0.18 points. British spot cotton rose by 0.06 points, and futures rose by 0.03-0.06 points. Indian cotton transactions were not high, and prices were firm due to positive news from Liverpool. Pingguo rose by 2 rupees, Aomula rose by 1.75 rupees, and Bailuoxi rose by 2.75 rupees. The original telegram record is on the left (telegram of the 8th).</p>

<p>The flour market opened this morning with a continued initial decline. Foreign wheat prices fell, with spot prices for this month dropping to 8.45 yuan. Forward prices also fell by 0.02-0.03 yuan. After the second session, supply dwindled and bullish investors remained active, stabilizing the market. Afternoon trading was thin (only over 200,000 bags traded), but sentiment improved as gold prices continued to rise. Spot foreign wheat was difficult to move, and bids for all months rose, surpassing the previous day's closing prices by almost a cent.</p>

<p>Black melon seeds have been rising steadily. Yesterday, Chen Xu Kui melon seeds continued to arrive on the market, and the offered price suddenly increased by 0.80 yuan, with transactions at 15 yuan.

<p>— Yang'an</p>
<p>National Day, year after year, forces a smile,</p>
<p>Gloomy thoughts today, for whom can they beguile?</p>
<p>Don't throw away the glimmer of hope we hold,</p>
<p>A patriotic heart will never grow cold.</p>
<p>This is a poem by the reporter today, reflecting on his feelings. The reader may ask what it means, so let me explain: In the Republic of China since 1935, our National Day celebrations have taken place amidst natural disasters and man-made calamities, living a life of bleakness and hardship, forcing a smile while harboring unspeakable suffering in our hearts. Therefore, when someone asked me to write an article commemorating National Day, I always declined, not wanting to join in the superficial excitement, nor wanting to make insincere statements. It is better to remain silent and avoid trouble. However, looking at the public sentiment and patriotic fervor of recent years, especially regarding domestic goods, there is some consolation. The production of domestic goods has increased year after year. Many domestic manufacturers have exerted great effort to create domestic goods that are as exquisite as imported goods, making it difficult to distinguish between them at a glance. So, even though it is clearly a domestic product, some people still doubt whether it is. This is the glimmer of hope in China recently. Furthermore, looking at the general populace, except for those who are infatuated with foreign goods and do not understand patriotism, the majority of the people support domestic goods, inquiring and investigating whether a product is domestic before purchasing it. Sometimes domestic goods are more expensive or of slightly lower quality, but they still prefer to buy domestic goods. Everyone shares this sentiment, and this is progress in the public's mentality in recent years, and it is a glimmer of hope for national rejuvenation. The reporter sincerely hopes that everyone will promote and maintain this spirit. Regardless of any coercion, inducement, or even prohibition of speaking against foreign goods or promoting domestic goods, our hearts for loving the country and using domestic goods will never retreat or be forgotten. It is precisely:</p>
<p>Heaven and earth will end someday,</p>
<p>But the patriotic heart will never decay.</p>
<h3 id="e163">National Day and National Goods <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>— Xuanwan</p>
<p>Time does not slow down because of our economic straits, and our annual National Day has arrived once again. In today's environment of national industry decline, rural bankruptcy, and the entire business community shrouded in recession, we encounter the arrival of this National Day with mixed feelings. But we must understand that this is not a time for empty words. The death knell of market segmentation and strife has long broken our eardrums. The angry tide of the global economic panic has long stirred our heartstrings. The only hope before us is to build strong barriers, cultivate strength, and prepare to cope with this foreign aggression. Therefore, promoting domestic goods and eliminating trade deficits are our most important and practical tasks. At the same time, today is a day for us to look back on the past, examine the present, and look forward to the future.</p>
<p>This year, as everyone knows, is the Student National Goods Year, the third year of the increasingly practical national goods movement. Although the national goods journey is fraught with thorns, it is still struggling along a difficult path due to numerous obstacles ahead. However, fortunately, many business leaders and enthusiasts are calling out, proclaiming, and tirelessly striving to pursue a bright future. Therefore, the achievements of the past three years, whether in production and sales cooperation, product improvement, or expansion of the domestic goods market, have all provided a great boost to the development of national goods. This is a great achievement that can never be erased.</p>
<p>I have an even more fervent hope that everyone will engage in meaningful national goods work on National Day. We know that there are currently two lines of action for developing the future of national production. The first is to seek new opportunities for promoting domestic goods in the interior and deepening their reach among the people. With our vast territory, the border provinces, such as Sichuan, Shaanxi, Gansu, Yunnan, and Guizhou, are in great need of our domestic goods. The second is to realize the plan to expand overseas markets and engage in more international trade to recover a portion of the trade deficit. We hope to accomplish these two tasks in the final three months of this year so that the momentum of the "Student National Goods Year" can become even more intense and establish a rapidly advancing posture.</p>
<p>This is a very bleak National Day. We have nothing to celebrate. We must quickly break free from economic shackles and open up a new path. "Reducing trade deficits" and "safeguarding national products" are our most important and fundamental tasks at present!</p>
<h3 id="e164">Double Tenth Festival and the National Goods Movement <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>— Baling</p>
<p>The God of Time performs his duties, causing time to pass according to a fixed order. Quickly, it is already the Double Tenth Festival of the 24th year of the Republic of China. We are delighted to celebrate the Double Tenth Festival, which commemorates the creation of the Republic of China. However, when we examine everything about the country and the situation of the people, we cannot help but reduce the intensity of our joy. This is such a disappointing and regrettable thing!</p>
<p>China has been too unfortunate in these past twenty-odd years! The constant internal warfare of the past is indeed a major stain on the history of the Republic of China, a stain that can never be washed away.</p>
<p>Therefore, to summarize, the internal and external troubles of the Republic of China in the past twenty-odd years have almost plunged the entire country into a state of decline. Like a person who was originally very strong but has suffered from many external and internal ailments, catching colds and sores from time to time, spending almost every day of the year with medicine, how can such a person be healthy? An individual cannot withstand various ailments, so how can a country withstand the arrival of internal and external troubles year after year? This is a definite principle that no one can deny.</p>
<p>However, having said that, anyone who suffers from an illness naturally has a source of the disease. After finding the root cause of the disease, and then prescribing the right medicine, they will gradually embark on the road to recovery. The poverty and weakness of a country naturally have reasons for its poverty and weakness. After knowing the reasons, and then coming up with various remedial measures, they will naturally gradually embark on the road to prosperity and strength. What are the sources of China's illness? In my view, there are many sources of China's illness, but the fact that the people of the whole country cannot earnestly consume domestic goods is really the most important source of illness. Mr. Sun Yat-sen said: "When we Chinese consume foreign goods, we lose 500 million yuan of cash every year. On average, each person accounts for more than one yuan." Since the opening of the sea ban, the import of foreign goods has been endless and increasing, and the quantity is far more than 500 million yuan. However, even if we consider it to be 500 million yuan per year, what would be the total in the past twenty-odd years? It is shocking and lamentable! Cash outflow and silver export year after year, any rich and strong country will ultimately go to the path of poverty and weakness. Therefore, from this point of view, if we want to save the country, the first thing we should do is to earnestly consume domestic goods. Mr. Pan Yangyao said: "The way to save the country, of course, requires starting from all aspects, but the promotion of domestic goods cannot be ignored." These few words are very insightful, and I sincerely hope that all compatriots throughout the country will, from now on, embrace the idea of consuming domestic goods and establish the concept of consuming domestic goods. If everyone does so, then the country will naturally become rich and strong after three years. Today is the Double Tenth Festival of the 24th year of the Republic of China. We hope that from today onwards, all compatriots throughout the country will rise up to promote domestic goods and consume domestic goods so that today's Double Tenth Festival not only contains the meaning of celebrating the Double Tenth but is also the day when all compatriots throughout the country begin a general mobilization to consume domestic goods.</p>
<h3 id="e165">Reflecting on the Significance of Prioritizing National Goods on National Day <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>— Qingqu</p>
<p>Today is the anniversary of National Day. Every citizen of the Republic of China knows that on this day, we should commemorate the martyrs of the Wuchang Uprising twenty-four years ago. If you forget this glorious and bloody page in history, you are forgetting your roots! Alas, when I think of this, I cannot help but turn to the words "national goods". Why do we still advocate them all the time? In fact, the importance of commemorating the founding of the nation does not lie in etiquette, holidays, meetings, speeches, or in rejoicing, jumping, entertainment, and singing, which are just formalities. The only main purpose is to "commemorate", not "commemorate" this day, but to "commemorate" the hardship of creation and what can consolidate the foundation of the nation and develop national production. Only then can it be considered "commemoration", only then does it have some meaning.</p>
<p>So today, I will write a tribute on prioritizing "national goods", because now, even though we shout about it everywhere, I still feel that many people do not fully understand, thinking that "national goods" are not as beautiful as "foreign goods". Their psychology is based on the following three reasons: First, they believe that the world is advancing day by day, and human desires and preferences are also becoming more and more luxurious. The origin of luxury is that as people become more intelligent, all creations change from simple to novel, from clumsy to ingenious. Human beings are endowed with aesthetic sensibilities, and their psychology naturally inclines towards novelty and ingenuity. Second, they believe that in international trade, all efforts are focused on competition. The production of goods is mostly aimed at pleasing people in order to expand profits. Therefore, for ordinary daily necessities, if country A has something that country B does not, country B will inevitably buy the goods from country A to satisfy their desires, even if it costs a lot of money. Third, the upper class places the most importance on appearance. All aspects of clothing, food, and housing must be commensurate with their status. Therefore, the more wealthy and high-ranking people are, the more extravagant their daily lives will be. They believe that if they are not like this, it is not enough to show off their wealth and prestige, and they may even be looked down upon by others and ridiculed. Even if they do not have this power, they have to force themselves to follow the trend. Because of these three reasons, even though we advocate "national goods" every day, the increase in the import of foreign goods has not decreased. This is so heartbreaking!</p>
<p>Alas, in fact, this phenomenon is the main problem with not being willing to prioritize "national goods". Regardless of the type of item, whether it is for application or purely for consumption, it is always more glorious to purchase what one owns and manufactures. Why is that? Is it true that the people of the magnificent Republic of China have nothing that can satisfy their desires without foreign goods? You must know that the people of a country who do not value their own national goods and love the goods of others are exposing the most shameful and thoughtless behavior. If you still know that today is the National Day of the Republic of China, then it is to show everyone not to forget the foundation of the country. The foundation of the country needs to be protected, so why can "national goods" be despised?</p>
<h3 id="e166">A Visit to the China Pencil Factory <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>— Tianran</p>
<p>Yesterday, at the invitation of Mr. Wu Gengmei, the director of the China Pencil Factory, the reporter, accompanied by Mr. Cheng Xiyun, Mr. Shan Kuiya, and Mr. Sun Fengqi, visited the factory at 1176 Xiexu Road. Mr. Wu provided detailed guidance, and I gained much insight. Mr. Wu said that the pencil manufacturing industry is a type of daily-use industry within the chemical industry, occupying an important position among stationery items in various countries, especially in relation to elementary school students. The Chinese people do not pay much attention to it because of its small value and trivial nature. Except for the Kowloon Dahua Pencil Factory, no other domestic pencil products have been heard of in the country. The outflow of benefits is extremely regrettable. According to customs trade books, pencil imports to our country reached a huge 1.5 million yuan last year, which is shocking. The important raw materials for pencils are wood, pencil lead, and clay. The wood should be evergreen trees of the pine and fir family. High-grade pencils use wood mostly produced in the United States. The northeastern provinces of our country also produce a lot of it. Common wood, such as linden, yew, round juniper, poplar, and fruit pine, is abundantly produced in various provinces of North China and can be used. Pencil lead, also known as Graphite, is abundant in Shanxi, Shaanxi, Shandong, Hebei, Jiangsu, Hunan, and Fujian provinces in our country. Jiangsu province produces a lot of earthy graphite in Bojiang and Nanjing, but the composition is relatively low. In addition, Baozuo in Hunan and Qinling in Shaanxi have a content of 94%, and this type of graphite is most suitable for use. As for clay, it is readily available everywhere in the Jiangnan area. Setting up a factory to manufacture with the country's rich raw materials and low-cost labor is extremely appropriate. When Mr. Wu studied applied chemistry in Japan, he interned for more than a year at the Nagasaki Daiwa Pencil Co., Ltd. in Japan, gaining a full understanding of the manufacture of black lead pencils, colored pencils, and copying pencils. After returning to China, he raised a capital of 50,000 yuan, rented a factory to start work, trained the workers' skills, and selected suitable raw materials. The factory rented silk factory buildings, which are very spacious. The mechanical equipment includes clay washing equipment, sedimentation equipment, clay filtering rack, filter press, mixing mill, pencil core rolling machine, hammer machine, pencil core pressing machine, ten-horsepower electric motor, drying rack, blower, combustion furnace, polishing machine, core slot manufacturing machine, baking plate machine, glue board tightening machine, shaft board saw head machine, half-face shaft making machine, shaft making machine, knife sharpening machine, cutting machine, painting machine, and shaft tail trimming machine. More than 15,000 yuan has been spent, mostly made by the Shunchang factory. The tour of the work is divided into three departments: the woodworking department, the core making department, and the finished product department. The woodworking department includes sawing wood, drying, flattening, and making grooves. The core making department includes ingredient preparation, grinding filtration, drying, rolling, spring cake, strip drawing, baking, and oil immersion. The finished product department includes core addition, compression, drying, polishing, flat head, painting, printing, and packaging. From sawing wood to packaging, more than thirty procedures are required. Mr. Wu said: The full factory can produce 200 baskets of pencils a day, but at present, because the products have not been formally released, only 50 baskets are produced. There are two types of trademarks: Ding brand and Aircraft brand. After a trial run, both felt that they were not inferior to imported products. There are only two pencil factories in our country, China and Dahua. The total production volume is at most 700 baskets per day, and the annual production is about 20 million baskets. The average person in the country uses only one-twentieth of a pencil, which is not enough to be self-sufficient. This requires striving for expansion to achieve mass production, so that several million yuan of stationery benefits per year can be recovered somewhat. This year happens to be the Student National Goods Year, and the factory's timely emergence is especially admirable. I sincerely hope that the student community and stationery sellers will unanimously adopt the factory's products to support its success and create a new era for domestic stationery.</p>

<h3 id="e168">Magnificent Venue Arrangement <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>The venue for the games has been fully arranged. It is surrounded by iron fencing and includes an athletics field, a gymnasium, a swimming pool, volleyball and tennis courts, a baseball field, and a martial arts arena, comprising six major sections. All dormitories, cafeterias, temporary marketplaces, etc., have designated locations. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The Entire Venue's Architecture is Imposing and Orderly</p>
<p>The competition venue is divided into four areas. The sports field is in a long oval shape, with red brick walls resembling ancient castles. The east and west grandstands face each other. The west grandstand faces Guobei Road, with a plaza in front surrounded by iron railings and two gates on the left and right, serving as entrances for honored guests and special spectators. At the entrance to the east grandstand on Guohe Road, a black sign is erected to display records. The surrounding stands each have multiple entrances, accessible from Zhengdong Road and Zhengxu Road. The gymnasium and swimming pool are located east of the sports field, facing north and south, respectively. The tennis and team handball courts are between the swimming pool and the sports field. Spectators in the north and south stands enter the venue through the main gate on Guohe Road, with ticket booths at each gate.</p>
<p>The Grandstands Exude Majesty and Solemnity</p>
<p>Above the main gate of the games are large black characters reading "National Pillar," with "Self-Improvement" on the left and "Our Martial Prowess" on the right. Upon entering is the west grandstand, with VIP seating. News reporters' seats are adjacent on both sides. The top of the grandstand is covered with red silk, and the front is adorned with fresh flowers and wrapped in red and green ribbons. A portrait of the late Chairman of Zhongshan County stands on the grandstand, facing the east grandstand from afar. A new-style scoreboard stands clear and conspicuous. Loudspeakers are set up on the left and right below the grandstand. There are sixteen loudspeakers throughout the venue, ensuring that the commander's voice can be heard by tens of thousands of people.</p>
<p>Three Types of Flags Flutter Throughout the Venue</p>
<p>Numerous party flags, national flags, and games flags – no less than several hundred – are hoisted on flagpoles around the athletics field, swimming pool, and stands. The red, blue, black, and white colors intermingle and flutter in the wind, striking the eye. Flagpoles have also been reserved for tomorrow, when the units of each province and city will hoist their flags, alternating in yellow, which will be even more beautiful.</p>
<p>Separate Male and Female Dormitories</p>
<p>The male athletes' dormitories are located around the athletics field, with eight rooms in total, each equipped with double iron beds accommodating four people. Between each dormitory are toilets, bathrooms, and washrooms, with comprehensive facilities. The female athletes' dormitories are all located in the gymnasium, separated by a clear division to prevent mixing.</p>
<p>Meals Feature Five Different Flavors</p>
<p>The games cafeteria is located next to the volleyball and tennis courts, comprising six large sheds. The cuisine is divided into five flavors: plain, Jiangsu, Sichuan, Cantonese, and halal. Staff and athletes are catered to separately. The dishes are contracted to major restaurants in the city. Spectators can purchase food freely from temporary vendors.</p>
<p>Comprehensive Sanitation and Fire Safety Facilities</p>
<p>The games' sanitation facilities are located next to the sanitation team's office, with a clinic staffed by two physicians and two counselors on constant duty. A convalescent room with twenty beds is located at the southeastern entrance of the venue, dedicated to the medical care of people with minor illnesses or injuries. There are thirteen nurses and four first-aid teams stationed at the basketball court, martial arts arena, swimming pool, and athletics field. For fire safety, a fire station equipped with the latest fire-fighting equipment is set up near the swimming pool.</p>
<p>Convenient Postal, Telegraph, and Transportation Services</p>
<p>Postal and telegraph services have branches at the entrance to the west grandstand. Traffic routes for various vehicles and parking areas are designated. Temporary buses between Baoshan Road and Sanmin Road, operated by the two railway bureaus, begin service today. Public buses have also added more services, greatly facilitating travel for spectators.</p>
<p>Six Memorial Arches Erected Along the Route</p>
<p>Memorial arches have been erected around the venue: one near the Liangjiang area, three on Songhu Road, and two on Guohe Road. They feature white characters on a red background with blue borders. The municipal government has also composed congratulatory couplets on either side of the main gate.</p>

<h3 id="e184">The Sixth National Games Opening Ceremony <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>— President Wang Shijie</p>
<p>Today is the first day of the Sixth National Games. The holding of the National Games has two basic purposes: first, such a grand gathering can arouse the strong attention of the people across the country to sports; second, the skills, physique, and spirit demonstrated by the athletes can provide a good example for the youth across the country. Therefore, I would like to extend the following two hopes to all the male and female athletes of this Games:</p>
<p>1.  Strictly Adhere to the Belief in Fair Competition</p>
<p>All sports events in modern sports aim to train fair competition. Any society, any undertaking, cannot progress without competition, and competition without proper rules and scope can never progress. The so-called fair competition, in terms of action, means obeying the rules and following the referees, and in terms of attitude, means that the winners are not arrogant or negligent, and the losers are ambitious and tolerant.</p>
<p>2.  Fully Demonstrate the Ability of Team Cooperation</p>
<p>In modern sports events, some events not only train fair competition between opponents, but also train the cooperation of various parts of each team. Ball games such as football, basketball, and volleyball are all such events. In terms of educational significance, this type of sport is more important than many other sports. Outsiders often criticize our national character, saying that our people have strong individuality and weak group spirit. In other words, the ability to cooperate is lacking. I do not believe that the talent of our people has any particular weaknesses. I believe that all human weaknesses are the result of education or lack of education. In previous Far Eastern Games, although we did not achieve special results in various individual competitions in track and field, we have repeatedly maintained our leading position in football. This is something we can take pride in. From this, it can be seen that the criticism from outsiders is not correct. I sincerely hope that all units participating in the sports meet this time will make great progress in ball games and fully demonstrate the rapid progress of the ability of our youth to engage in team activities.</p>
<p>The above are my expectations for all athletes. In addition, I hope that the holding of this conference will enable us, from top to bottom, to work together towards the following two major goals:</p>
<p>First, the whole country must be healthy and strong. To achieve this goal, we must seek the popularization of sports. In the past, our physical education was a compulsory subject in elementary and middle schools, but a free subject in universities. In recent years, we have made physical education a compulsory subject in elementary, middle, and universities. In the past, there were no public sports venues in various places. In recent years, the government has urged various places to increase public sports venues in order to develop amateur sports. I hope that this work will move forward rapidly, so that the habit of loving sports can not only be popularized among young people in schools, but also among all classes of the elderly, children, men, and women in the shortest possible time.</p>
<p>Second, the whole country unites to participate. The athletes participating in this conference include compatriots from various provinces in the mainland, compatriots from remote areas, compatriots from the Northeast, and overseas Chinese from various places. The number of units and the number of people are unprecedented. It can be seen that the more serious the national crisis, the more obvious and stronger the will of young people with the blood of the great Chinese nation to uphold national unity. No force can destroy it. This will should be extended to the entire nation to create national unity as a permanent guarantee for the survival and development of the Republic of China and the great Chinese nation.</p>
<p>With our goals set, we also hope that all institutions in the country with the responsibility of publicity, especially those engaged in news, film, and other businesses, will give ample opportunities to disseminate sports news, so that national health and national unity can be quickly achieved for national publicity. I wish this National Games a success.</p>
<h3 id="e185">The History and Significance of the National Games <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>— Hao Gengsheng, Deputy Director of the Preparatory Committee</p>
<p>The Sixth National Games will be held on the National Day of the 24th year of the Republic of China at the newly built stadium in the central district of Shanghai. Since the beginning of sports gatherings in the country, this session should be the most detailed and reasonably organized in terms of organization and equipment. However, climbing high requires starting from low, and without the guidance of the previous five sessions, it would be difficult to expect today's progress. Neglecting planting seeds will not yield grain, and reflecting on the past can sharpen the present. Gengsheng recalls past events and briefly talks about the true meaning of holding this conference. Reference and comparison are the most important processes for career advancement, and the country and society must gather talents and resources to form this grand gathering. It is even more necessary to promote the true meaning so that each session of the conference affairs leaves a lasting impression, so that each conference has its value, and can achieve the practical effect of gradual advancement.</p>
<p>1.  The History of Previous Conferences. The first conference was held in Nanjing from October 18th to 22nd, two years before the founding of the Republic of China, with the five districts of Southeast, Northwest, and Central as participating units. Most of the people in charge were foreign missionaries. The second conference was held in Beijing from May 22nd to 24th in the third year of the Republic of China, and was still mostly hosted by Westerners from the YMCA. The regulations and organization of these two sessions were inevitably immature due to being in the early stages of creation. The third session was held in Wuchang from May 22nd to 24th in the thirteenth year of the Republic of China. From this session onwards, the authority of the conference began to be assumed by Chinese people. The fourth session was held in Hangzhou from August 1st to 10th in the nineteenth year of the Republic of China. It was the first National Games after the establishment of the National Government. The fifth session was held in the capital from October 10th to 20th in the twenty-second year of the Republic of China, and the conference affairs were entirely hosted by the central government.</p>
<p>2.  The Evolution of Previous Conference Affairs. In the first two sessions, the initiative belonged to foreigners, and the participants only played a supporting role. The competition events and organizational rules were not perfect. Conference documents were often published in English. At that time, although there was no shortage of insightful views on the sports meeting among the general public, some spectators viewed this meeting as similar to spring hunts and autumn hunts, thinking it was a temporary excitement. Ten years later, the third conference was held in Wuchang, and the cadres and staff were managed by Chinese people. The number of events was expanded to ten, and the number of participants reached fourteen provinces and regions. All competition rules were gradually organized, and the pre-selection meetings held by various provinces and regions to participate in this conference were held more than thirty times. With so many gatherings, the benefits obtained were naturally more extensive. Six years later, the Zhejiang Provincial Government initiated the fourth conference in Hangzhou. Although this conference was convened by Zhejiang Province, the central government provided assistance at any time, so the number of participating units increased to twenty-one. Various competition records also broke previous records. The social concept of sports meetings also changed at this time, and it was no longer lightly regarded as entertainment. Three years later, the central government, due to the successful construction of the Capital Stadium, convened the fifth conference in Nanjing on the National Day. The number of participating units reached thirty-two, and the number of athletes was more than 2,200. This was the first time that the central government officially prepared for the conference, and the progress of the conference affairs was so significant that it added a new light to the history of the conference. Summarizing the gradual progress of the past five sessions, the following four points are the reasons for the evolution: A, Athletes were selected from schools and changed to being selected from society; B, Foreigners hosted the conference and then Chinese hosted it, and then local governments and the central government hosted it; C, Old competition events were changed to modern competition methods, all regulations were in accordance with the standards, and the types of competitions gradually became complete; D, The Chinese people's understanding of sports has become deeper than before, and large-scale sports gatherings are an important process for training young people, which has gradually been valued by the Chinese people.</p>
<p>3.  The Formulation of Laws, Regulations, and Rules for This Conference. In the past, the National Games were held without a fixed time and the organization had no fixed rules. Starting from this conference, the Ministry of Education drafted seven articles of the National Games Holding Regulations on May 5th, which were approved by the Executive Yuan meeting and promulgated and implemented by the Ministry of Education based on the original draft of the Fifth National Games. All competition rules were carefully revised one by one in accordance with the current situation at home and abroad. From then on, the conference rules and regulations were established as a norm, so that this event became a systematic sports gathering in the country, and its organization also had a permanent foundation.</p>
<p>4.  The Significance of Holding This Conference. Recently, various provinces have been suffering from repeated disasters, and the international situation is also in a troubled time. Some say that the holding of sports meetings seems to be out of time and is seen as hasty and inappropriate. However, the world trend is deteriorating, and our country has no other strategy besides national self-improvement. With so many domestic disasters, we can only train the entire people to increase their collective and hardworking strength to defend against disasters and respond to changes. Therefore, the more difficult the country's situation, the more urgent the development of sports. This is a century-long plan for the country. Saving people in times of difficulty is like seeking medical treatment when sick, while peacetime reproduction, education, and training are equivalent to diet and nutrition. These two must be viewed equally and cannot be stopped just because medicine is being taken. Examining Western history books, even when other countries are at war with enemies, their domestic education work is still progressing unimpeded. In ancient China, there was also the teaching of "not abandoning chanting even when the city is besieged". Now that the times are more difficult and the people bear heavier responsibilities, large-scale sports gatherings are the best way to train and guide the entire people and temper young people. Performance shows the spirit of recuperation, competition creates a habit of courage and knowing shame, and forging physique and promoting unity are the common goals of the entire conference. Its significance is profound and is greater than any current rescue operation. As for the magnificence of the venue construction, it is related to the central construction of Shanghai and provides citizens with permanent enjoyment. As a place where Chinese and foreign spectators gather, we must strive for modernization, which should not be judged by frugality or extravagance.</p>
<p>5.  The Special Significance of Holding This Conference in Shanghai. Since the opening of Shanghai to foreign trade, such a grand gathering is the first time. The local government has spent a large sum of money to build sports venues and treat representative athletes from dozens of provinces and cities across the country here. The sincerity of its preparation and the greatness of its construction also make Shanghai the first place. Moreover, the construction of the central district of Shanghai has advanced from administrative facilities in a short period of time, and then promoted cultural development and sports, so that foreign and domestic people in Shanghai know the strong construction force of the government and arouse the general social belief in group organizations, which is also a special contribution of this conference held in Shanghai. I sincerely hope that the participants and the public of the conference will pay attention to neatness, solemnity, peace, and struggle, so as to love the country with self-love and respect the group with self-respect, so as not to fail the painstaking efforts of the past conferences.</p>
<p>As for the progress and decline of sports skills, in terms of the popularization of sports, there is no need to pay attention to it. However, the athletes of the National Games come from provinces and cities across the country, and they are all outstanding young people who have undergone considerable training and strict selection. Whether their mobility and group life are good or not, the impact on sports skills can be observed at this conference. We sincerely hope that the athletes from all over the world will earnestly respect discipline and carefully study under the guidance of their leaders, so that the spirit of self-improvement of our nation can be shown to the whole world, so as not to fail the valuable time and the deep expectations of the people.</p>
<h3 id="e186">After Minister of Education Wang Arrived in Shanghai, He Inspected the Venue Yesterday, Emphasizing that Athletes Should Pay Attention to Mental Training, and Our Country Should Take Ball Games as National Games — Chen Gongbo and Others Also Visited the Venue — <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>Wang Shijie, President of the Conference, flew from Beijing to Shanghai the day before yesterday to preside over the opening ceremony. At about 10 o'clock yesterday morning, he was accompanied by Pan Gongzhan, Director of the Municipal Education Bureau, Lei Zhen, Director of the General Affairs Department of the Ministry of Education, Hao Gengsheng, Sports Supervisor, and others to visit the conference venue. First, he went to the track and field venue and inspected various office rooms for a week, and then entered the sports field to view the sports field. He praised the construction of the rostrum and the equipment on the field and the laying of the track. He then went to the swimming pool and asked about the various facilities in great detail. Director Pan and Supervisor Hao gave detailed answers. After that, he inspected the gymnasium, volleyball court, and net field for a week, and generally expressed satisfaction. When asked by reporters about his feelings about this conference, according to his personal opinion, athletes should first pay attention to mental training, and technical training is secondary. Without good mental training, unethical and undisciplined things in sports are likely to happen, and even if there is good technology, it is not worth taking. In the past, there were often disputes in sports meetings. The discipline of this session is stricter than in the past. I hope that all athletes will strictly follow the rules and regulations and not abandon themselves. (2) The number of participating units in this conference has reached as many as 38, and even places as far away as Malaya, Java, the Philippines, Xinjiang, Tibet, and Mongolia have come to participate. Its grand scale is unprecedented, and it can be seen that the whole country is promoting sports, which makes people feel no small excitement. (3) In addition, for the selection of popular sports in our country, we should focus on ball games, because ball games not only forge personal physique, but also have the spirit of teamwork. For example, our country's football has maintained the championship in the Far East, which is a glorious page in the history of physical education.</p>
<p>Chen Gongbo, Minister of Industry, accompanied by Wang Jilu, a member of the Central Committee, also visited the conference venue for a week yesterday afternoon at 2:30, accompanied by Mayor Wu and Director Cai of the Public Security Bureau. Chen and Wang were very satisfied with the thoughtful equipment of the conference, and returned after about half an hour.</p>

(However, if the two people have met in the original order, the result of that competition will be the standard, and there is no need for another competition.) If the two units have the same ranking in one of the singles and doubles, and the other ranking is not the same (such as each getting a first place, and team A getting a second place and team B getting a third place), the order of the unequal ranking will be used to determine the score.</p>

<h3 id="e188">Competition Rules Differences <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>There are many changes to this year's competition rules. The main points are recorded below, along with explanations:</p>
<p>Individual events will take the top six finishers. In this year's track and field events, swimming, combined events, and Chinese martial arts, the top six finishers in each event will be selected. Their scores will be calculated as 7, 5, 4, 3, 2, and 1 respectively. Relay races will also take the top six teams. The scoring for relay races in combined events will remain at 7, 5, 4, 3, and 2, but the scores for all other relay races will be doubled. This change in the rules is intended to give athletes more opportunities to win and increase interest with the meaning of awards and advancement. Otherwise, with many units and a large number of people, it would be difficult to win a single place. Selecting the top six finishers can give athletes a great deal of excitement.</p>
<p>All sports will generally take the top four finishers. This year, all championship trophies must have their top four finishers determined, and their scores will be stipulated. The champion will receive four points, the runner-up three points, the third-place finisher two points, and the fourth-place finisher one point. In track and field, combined events, and swimming, sorting out first, second, third, and fourth places is not a problem. Because of the large number of teams participating in ball games, a knockout system will still be used. Within the knockout system, the champion, runner-up, third, and fourth places will be determined separately. Therefore, the scheduling order for this year's ball game competitions has been carefully considered so that the strongest teams can reach the semi-finals.</p>
<p>Method for Judging Ball Game Rankings. All ball games, except tennis, will use a knockout system. The winner of the final is the champion and gets the championship trophy. The runner-up, third, and fourth places will be determined by having the other three teams in the semi-final round compete again once or twice. The method is as follows:</p>
<p>Team A wins the championship trophy and is the champion. In addition to Team A, Teams B, C, and D must compete again to determine second, third, and fourth places. First, the two teams that lost in the semi-finals compete (B vs. D). The loser is in fourth place. If D loses, then D is fourth. B and C then compete once more. The winner is second, and the loser is third. If B loses to D in the B vs. D match, then B is fourth, D is third, and C is second, because C already lost to B in the semi-finals, so there is no need to compete again.</p>
<p>Changes to the Tennis Championship Method. Tennis Championship,</p>
<p>This year, the collective elimination method by unit will not be adopted. Instead, individual elimination methods for singles and doubles will be used. The rankings and results of each unit in singles and doubles will be combined to determine the champion, runner-up, third, and fourth place teams. Each unit can still participate with two singles players and one doubles team. Singles players can also play doubles. This allows the strongest singles players and the strongest doubles teams in the country to be seen. It also retains the inherent spirit of the collective elimination method of unit vs. unit, singles and doubles of the previous session. The competition committee will determine the champion, runner-up, third, and fourth places based on the performance and rankings of each unit in singles and doubles.</p>

<h3 id="e194">Miscellaneous Writings From Various Units: Jin To Win the 10,000 Meter Champion <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>The Shanxi 10,000-meter experts Gu Desheng, Wang Huibin, Chen Shusen, and Li Denggui have been practicing diligently at the venue these days. All four are in the 5th Regiment of the 101st Division of Shanxi, serving as squad leaders or team leaders. They practice regularly regardless of the cold or heat. In the preliminary rounds of this National Games, Gu's time was 33 minutes and 45 seconds, Wang's time was 33 minutes and 48 seconds, Chen's time was 34 minutes and 25 seconds, and Li's time was the same as Chen's. They may be able to take the top four places in this year's competition. The middle-distance star Yang Maosheng is also in the same regiment as them. His 800-meter time is 2 minutes and 6 seconds, and he may also win a place in the conference.</p>

<p>Guangdong Football Sales Affected</p>
<p>Among the number of athletes and staff participating from various units in this session, the Guangdong team is the largest after Shanghai, with a total of more than 180 athletes and staff. Its strength is best in football, volleyball, and swimming. However, the strength of football has been somewhat affected due to the special reasons why Li Tiansheng, Feng Jingxiang, Ye Beihua, and Huang Jiliang did not come. However, others have been selected to replace them, and the hope of winning the championship is still very strong. In addition, the strength in track and field is also considerable. For example, Zhao Bingheng and Ruan Zhouquan in men's sprints, Zhang Jieqiong in women's sprints, was the 50-meter champion in the previous session, and the new player She Shangying is a rising star, and their results have exceeded the previous session. The team's selection standards are extremely strict and have undergone three training periods. They were trained in districts during the summer, concentrated in the provincial capital for the second training period, and universally trained once before departure. Those who did not meet the standards were discarded and not dispatched. Therefore, the track and field strength of the team is at a good level.</p>
<p>Jin Zhongkang Plans to Go All Out</p>
<p>The sprint star Cheng Jinguang has not come to Shanghai with the Jiangsu team recently due to physical discomfort. He was originally scheduled to arrive at the conference on the 8th, but he has not been seen as of yesterday afternoon. It is not certain whether he will come. Even if he comes, due to health reasons, he is afraid that there is little hope of scoring. Jin Zhongkang saw the report that he had no hope of scoring, and was quite excited. He planned to go all out on the track to prove that his blade was still sharp.</p>

<h3 id="e197">Referee Meeting: Report on Important Matters for Referees; Mr. Zhang Boling's Speech on the Responsibility of Referees <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>The referees for the Sixth National Games were summoned for a meeting yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM at the Delin Public House. At the same time, badges, the Games' order of events booklet, and various competition regulations and rules were distributed. Dr. Zhang Boling, the Chief Referee of the Games, was invited to give a speech. The meeting was held in two locations: the dining room on the second floor for track and field, all-around, and swimming, and the dining room on the fourth floor for all ball sports. Mr. Jiang Xiangqing presided over the ball sports meeting, while Mr. Wu Bangwei presided over the track and field, all-around, and swimming meeting. After the reports and speeches, group meetings were held. The meeting adjourned with refreshments at 5:00 PM sharp. Over two hundred people attended yesterday's meeting, including Zhang Boling, Jiang Xiangqing, Wu Bangwei, Ling Xitao, and Peng Sanmei. Details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Important Matters for Referees</p>
<p>First, Mr. Wu Bangwei reported on important matters for referees, listed in several points: (1) All referees are requested to attend the parade during the opening ceremony. The assembly point is on the cinder path outside the east command platform. Assemble at 9:40 AM, and be ready to depart at 9:55 AM. It is best for all to wear dark blue or similar colored tops and white trousers. If wearing traditional Chinese clothing, then all must wear a mandarin jacket. Arrange in four rows of vertical columns, preferably in order of height, with the tallest in front. During the parade, follow the military band at a distance of eight paces, circling half the field to the front of the command platform, then leave the team to go to the referee seating area south of the command platform (still in four rows of vertical columns until reaching the platform, then disperse and take seats). There is no need to continue the parade. (2) To maximize the effectiveness of the referees, Mr. Zhang Boling is invited to give a speech after the report, and group meetings will be held. The head referees of each event will convene the relevant referees to discuss technical and cooperative issues related to refereeing and to unify the interpretation of the rules. Issues that commonly arise should be especially studied and decided to avoid discrepancies. Referees who are assigned to multiple events are requested to decide which group to participate in, but should contact the head referee of the absent group afterward to understand the passed information and key decisions. (3) Referees can access the referee seating area south of the command platform in the sports field to watch the competition. The swimming pool, gymnasium, and baseball field can also be accessed to watch from the general stands with a badge, but there will be no designated seating. Due to limited seating at the volleyball and tennis courts, only referees assigned to volleyball or tennis can access the general stands with a badge. All other referees must purchase tickets to enter. This decision was made after careful consideration, and it is truly unavoidable. It is hoped that you will understand. (4) Only referees currently officiating the competition are allowed inside each competition venue. Please pay attention to maintaining order inside the competition venue. After the competition ends and the duty is finished, please switch to watching from the stands. (5) The Games have specially prescribed competition regulations, which are highly relevant to refereeing. Please read them carefully in advance. The methods for competing for various championships are published in the order of events booklet. Please pay attention to the number of places awarded and the methods for resolving wins and losses.</p>
<p>Track and Field and Swimming Sections</p>
<p>(1) This year's competition will not use the three-call procedure but will be held according to the scheduled time. Therefore, referees must arrive at the field early to make full preparations. During the competition, they must also be swift and agile and strive for time efficiency. As the time for each event is extremely tight, if any event is delayed, the subsequent events will inevitably be unable to start on time, and the entire order of the competition will completely fail. (2) The lanes for the sprint track races and swimming have already been arranged. The check-in staff only needs to check and direct according to the list and notify (by telephone) the chief finish judge of those who are absent. For the long-distance track races, the lanes must be drawn and arranged in the previously used method, and the chief finish judge must be notified of those who are absent. (3) The finish recording sheet has already noted the names, numbers, and units of the athletes in each lane of each heat, so the chief finish judge only needs to follow the notification from the check-in staff, cross out the number, name, and unit of those who are absent, and then raise the flag to notify the starter to begin the competition. (4) In terms of timing, the number of athletes qualified in the preliminaries and the results of the top six in the finals must all be recorded. (5) The inspectors have a report form. If there is a problem, please record it in detail according to the law and hand it over to the chief inspector, who will forward it to the chief referee for a decision. The hurdles have adopted a new style, so there is no need to record the hurdle knockdowns. (6) For the preliminaries and finals of field events, it is hoped that the competition can be divided into two locations so that the audience at both ends or sides of the field has the opportunity to watch. (7) The throwing sections of the field events have markings for world (red), Far East (blue), and national (white) records. Small flag markers are used during trial throws and are only measured after the final throws are completed to save procedures. After the athletes enter the field, the official competition will begin immediately, without giving each person a chance to try. However, each athlete can practice on their own (provided that it does not hinder the progress of the competition). (8) Regardless of track and field or all-around swimming events, the check-in staff and recorders must call the roll on time inside the gate before leading the participating athletes into the field. No accompanying personnel are allowed. Outerwear can be carried to the finish line by designated boy scouts. (9) Regardless of track and field or swimming events, at the end of each competition, the recorders should notify the venue manager of the results by telephone as quickly as possible so that they can inform the record keepers to hang up the results and the chief recorders to register the results. For track races, the preliminaries must be organized and lanes assigned. (10) Athletes are not allowed to use their own equipment for javelins, shot puts, discus, etc., except for the bamboo pole used in the pole vault. (Decision of the First Competition Committee) (11) Regarding the arrival of swimmers at the finish line, it has been decided by the group meeting that it will be considered an arrival regardless of which part of the body touches the edge of the pool first. It is not necessary for both hands to touch the edge at the same time, even if the head touches the edge first.</p>
<p>Matters Pertaining to Ball Sports Competitions</p>
<p>(1) For ball sports competitions, the venue equipment department will assign one staff member to be responsible for safekeeping on the field. If referees need anything, please contact them immediately. However, after the competition ends and the duty is completed, please return it to avoid loss. (2) The registered names, numbers, and photos of the players from each unit will be kept by one staff member assigned by the registration and allocation department. If any substitutions or doubts arise before or after the competition, you can contact them at any time to inquire and resolve them quickly. (3) The basketball games are scheduled closely back to back, so it is imperative to execute them on time and strive for efficiency to avoid postponing subsequent games. (4) There are fixed rules for the attendance of the first and second singles matches in tennis. Referees are requested to assist the staff of the registration and allocation department to pay special attention to this. (5) After the completion of each competition, in addition to signing the record book (this does not apply if there is no record book), the referee should fill out the referee report form as required and submit it to the referee department within one hour after the end of the competition so that the results can be announced and archived for future reference. (6) When executing referee duties for various ball sports competitions, it is best to have a fixed uniform. It is hoped that this will be discussed and decided in the group discussion. (7) The overtime period for a tie in soccer is thirty minutes, limited to one overtime period. If the game is still tied, a replay will be scheduled. (8) After the end of basketball, baseball, and softball games, the recorder must make a summary of the results and carefully verify the calculations. The wins and losses of each set in volleyball and tennis must also be clearly filled out on the record sheet so that it can be easily understood at a glance. (9) For soccer, referees must carry a pen and notebook to record shooting records and shooting order at all times. After the competition, the referee report form should be filled out accurately. (10) The allocation of duties for ball sports referees, timekeepers, recorders, linesmen, etc., will be announced at the Delin Public House and the referee department one day in advance. Please pay attention to the announcements in each of these places every evening. No further notification will be given.</p>
<p>Zhang Boling's Speech on the Issue of Responsibility</p>
<p>Next, Chief Referee Dr. Zhang Boling gave a speech on the issue of the responsibility of referees. He first stated that the financial and human resources spent on this Games are considerable, and the significance is also very great. In recent years, the morale of the people has been declining, and it is extremely important to awaken and change the prevailing customs among the people and inspire the people of the whole country to strive for strength. Now, youth representatives from all over the country and overseas Chinese are gathered here, which is enough to demonstrate the spirit of national unity and cooperation, so that the athletes participating in the Games and the people who come to watch, as well as the people across the country who read the newspapers, will be inspired and move forward because of the Games. Now, all matters for the Games have been prepared, and the official opening will be tomorrow (the 10th). From now on, it is time for our referees to work hard. It is hoped that everyone will do their best and perform their duties impartially in accordance with the rules. It is deeply hoped that under the efforts of all staff and all athletes in this Games, in addition to creating good results, there will also be a good spirit, and that the Games will be a satisfactory success. Then, although the cost is high, it is truly worthwhile.</p>
<h3 id="e198">National Arts Referee Meeting: Regulations for Archery Distance <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>The National Arts Referee Meeting was held yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM at the Eight Immortals Bridge Youth Association. The referees, including Chu Minyi, Section Chief Xu Zhiyi, expert Xu Yusheng, and over seventy referees, attended. General leaders and National Arts instructors from various provinces and cities were also invited to attend. First, Chu Minyi gave a speech, stating that since the last Games adopted National Arts as one of the championship competitions, this year's Games has eighteen units participating in National Arts, which is not as enthusiastic as ball sports and track and field, which is really a pity. Next, Xu Zhiyi reported on the preparations of the National Arts section and explained in detail the matters that each referee should pay attention to. The matters decided are as follows: 1. The distance for archery is not different for men and women. It is now decided that the distance for men is 30 meters, and the distance for women is 20 meters. 2. The distance for slingshot is set at 20 meters for men and 15 meters for women. 3. It was decided to hire National Arts experts from various units coming to Shanghai as honorary referees, but each unit is limited to recommending one person.</p>

<h3 id="e200">Today's Predictions for the Field Event Finals <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>Men's High Jump</p>
<p>The first final today is the men's high jump. There are a total of 59 participants. Based on past performance, Wu Bixian of Hubei has scored in the Far East Games. Liu Mingru of Nanjing and Zhou Shizhao of Jiangxi have both achieved 1.82 meters, so these three are the strongest. Qiu Guangxie, Xu Wenkui, Gu Huo, and Luo Douwen of Shanghai, Ge Ke of Hubei, Jing Qilin of Fujian, Yu Qingrong of Liaoning, and Wang Shilin of Beiping all have performances around 1.75 meters.</p>
<p>Women's Shot Put</p>
<p>Only 31 people are participating in the women's shot put. Since Ma Ji stepped down, no new records have been discovered. The champion this year should be either Chen Rongtang or Pan Yingchu. Both have scores around 10.2-3 meters, and breaking the national record of 10.35 meters is not difficult. It is likely that Shanghai will take all of the top four places. Ding Zhumei and Liang Guansen have hopes of getting third or fourth place. Chen Wanzhe of Beiping, known as the "female ox," has registered, but has not come to Shanghai to participate.</p>

<h3 id="e202">Flaws in the Arrangement of the Tennis Tournament; First Singles Players of Each Unit are All Placed on One Side, Preventing the Strongest Players from Meeting in the Finals <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>The rules for this year's tennis championship are newly established for this session, fundamentally changing the competition methods of previous sessions. The fourth session adopted the Davis Cup system, with two singles, two exchange singles, and one doubles match. The fifth session in Nanjing changed again, dividing into two singles and one doubles match. Singles players were not allowed to compete in doubles, setting an unprecedented example in tennis competition. This year's competition method is a complete reform, adopting individual elimination for singles and team elimination for doubles. It is not a competition between one unit against another, but a competition between individuals. Singles players and doubles teams are combined together for singles and doubles matches, and then the performance of each unit's representative in singles and doubles is used to determine the ownership of the championship. The same method applies to both men and women.</p>
<p>The advantage of this year's competition method is that, in addition to distinguishing the success of each team, it can also determine the performance of each player, so as to determine the ranking of national players. According to the decision of the regulations, the winner of the singles championship is the first place, and those who fail in the quarter-finals compete against each other to determine the fourth place. The winner of this match competes with the loser of the final to determine the second and third place. Therefore, the arrangement of the order of such a competition method is very important, and it is necessary to ensure that the four strongest singles players can reach the quarter-finals. Otherwise, if the strong meet the strong in the early weeks and eliminate each other, the original meaning of this new competition method will be lost.</p>
<p>Distinction Between First and Second Singles According to item 8 of the second notice of the Organizing Committee of the Conference, when registering tennis players of each unit, the registration should be filled out in the order of the players' skills, such as first singles and second singles, and divided into first singles and second singles. Therefore, the order book of this year's conference, the tennis order, does not list the names of the players, but only writes first singles and second singles. According to the notice of the conference, it is very obvious that the skills of the first singles are better than the second singles.</p>
<p>The Peculiarity of This Year's Order Arrangement But what is peculiar is that, according to the arrangement of the order, the first singles of each unit are all placed on one side, and the second singles are all placed on the other side. As a result of the competition, good players will inevitably meet good players first, and second-rate players will meet second-rate players. As a result of the elimination on the left side, the best of the first singles remains, and on the right side, the best of the second singles is eliminated. These two people hold the final. If so, how can the ranking of individuals be determined? There is no problem with the first place, but what about the second, third, and fourth places? Because the first singles are all placed together, some of the better ones have been eliminated in advance, so how can the decision of these second, third, and fourth places be said to be fair?</p>
<p>Good Players Cannot Meet in the Finals It is known to the whole country that the good players are Lin Wangsu from Malaya, Xu Chengji from Java, Wang Wenzheng from Sichuan, and Xu Weipei from Hong Kong, and Lin Baohua from Shanghai. These people are all listed as first singles and must meet in advance to compete. For example, Xu Weipei from Hong Kong must meet Xu Chengji in the second week. The only comparable players in the second singles are Qiu Feihai from Shanghai, Chen Qi'an from Malaya, and He Zong from Hong Kong. According to the situation, only one person from Xu, Wang, Lin, and Xu can reach the final. On the other hand, either Qiu Feihai or Chen Qi'an. It does not matter if the second, third, and fourth places are not distinguished. According to today's need to distinguish the third and fourth places, can this arrangement of order be said to be the most appropriate, the fairest, and the most perfect? It is a great regret that in the future, in tennis, there cannot be two of the strongest players holding the final. The women's competition is also the same. As far as I can see, I raise this to the Order Arrangement Committee for consideration.</p>
<h3 id="e203">Comparison of the Performance of Athletes from Various Places Across the Country This Year <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>The Sixth National Games, the most anticipated event, will be the creation of new records in track and field. It is expected that the existing national records will be broken in this conference. Therefore, we have specially reviewed the best records in national track and field competitions in the past nine months, and made a comparison. The ownership of the championship can also be predicted in advance. The names of the athletes with better performance from each province and city attending this National Games, as well as the results they have created this year, and the units they represent, are listed together. The competition for the track and field championship and the ranking of the selected will not be far from this table.</p>
<p>100m In the 100-meter race, Liu Changchun recently adopted the "pure Japanese method" and his performance has improved rapidly. It is said to be 10.34 seconds, which is very confident. The championship should belong to Liu Junlian. The results created by athletes from all over the country this year are as follows:</p>
<p>Name Unit Result This Year Location</p>
<p>Liu Changchun Far East 10.6 Qingdao Summer Training Camp</p>
<p>Zhao Bingheng Guangdong 11.0 Guangdong-Hong Kong Confrontation</p>
<p>Cheng Jinguan Jiangsu 11.1 Johns Hopkins-Soochow Confrontation</p>
<p>Fu Jincheng Malaya 11.1 Third Malaya</p>
<p>Huang Feiyan Shanghai 11.2 Jiangnan University Games</p>
<p>Zhang Kan Beiping 11.2 Beiping Guanghua-Minguo Team Confrontation</p>
<p>Han Jinglin Hebei 11.2 Hebei Provincial Preliminary</p>
<p>The top six in the 100-meter race in this conference should be these six people. Zhang Jiakui also created a result of 11.1 seconds this year, but he did not register for the 100-meter race in the National Games, so he is not included. Liaoning and Shanghai have the highest voices for the track and field championship. In the 100-meter race, Liaoning can take seven points first.</p>
<p>200m The champion is still Liu Changchun. Since Liu Changchun created a result of 22.1 seconds in the previous session, not only has it been rare to reach this level in the past two years, but it has also been very rare to break the 23-second barrier. In this event, in addition to Liu, Wu Jingyao from Liaoning also has the hope of being selected. Therefore, this event still belongs to Liaoning's victory.</p>
<p>Name Unit Result This Year Location</p>
<p>Liu Changchun Liaoning 22.6 Qingdao Summer Training</p>
<p>Fu Jincheng Malaya 22.8 Malaya</p>

<p>Dai Shutian Shanghai 23.6 Qingdao Summer Training</p>
<p>400m In the 400-meter event, Shanghai has two major generals, Dai Shutian and Dong Shuzhao, who will win an absolute victory. The result of this event is expected to break 52 seconds. The heat of the competition will be within expectations.</p>
<p>Name Unit Result This Year Location</p>
<p>Dai Shutian Shanghai 52.0 Shanghai Preliminary</p>

<p>Li Shiming Liaoning 53.2 Qingdao Summer Training</p>
<p>Dong Hanwen Liaoning 53.3 Qingdao Summer Training</p>
<p>Luo Qinglong's result this year was 52.9 seconds, but he has retired, so he is not included.</p>
<p>800m The 800-meter race is also one of the most interesting events. The fierce competition between Jia Lianren and Li Shiming will add a lot of color. The champion should belong to Li Jun. Jia admitted that he would avoid Li. In this event, Liaoning also took the first place, but the score may not be as high as Shanghai.</p>
<p>Name Unit Result This Year Location</p>
<p>Li Shiming Liaoning 2:03.3 Qingdao Summer Training</p>

<p>Hong Yongtang Shanghai 2:06.4 Zhejiang National Games</p>
<p>Hu Jinjia Shandong 2:07.6 Shandong Preliminary</p>
<p>Luo Qinglong's result this year was 2 minutes and 8.4 seconds, but he is not participating, so he is not included. Le Changjun's 2 minutes and 8.8 seconds in Shanghai is also not included due to qualification issues. It is said that Hong Yongtang's result is not accurate, so although he is included, it may be difficult to score points in the National Games.</p>
<p>1500m In the 1500-meter race, Shandong's two athletes, Qiu and Jia, both play for Shanghai, while Shanxi has two generals, Gu Desheng and Li Denggui. This scene is not without considerable interest. The promising candidates for this event are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Name Unit Result This Year Location</p>
<p>Qiu Zhongchen Shanghai 4:21.8 Shanghai Summer Training Camp</p>
<p>Jia Lianren Shanghai 4:22.0 Shandong-Fudan Confrontation</p>

<p>Wang Zhenglin Shanghai 4:24.4 Qingdao Summer Training</p>
<p>Wang Huibin Shanghai 4:24.9 Shanxi Preliminary</p>
<p>10000m The dispute over the 10,000 meters in the previous National Games is still remembered today. In this conference, the old debts will be recalculated. Shanxi is well-equipped in this event and can easily win all the prizes. Wang Zhenglin from Shanghai and Jin Zhong from Jiangsu may be lucky enough to get the top six places.</p>

<p>Li Jinquan Malaya 16.8 Third Malaya</p>
<p>Middle Hurdles In the 400-meter middle hurdles, Tao Yingjie from Shanghai was the champion of the previous session, but it may be difficult to be selected this time. Tan Fuzhen, the national record holder, has not had any good results this year, but the veteran Wang Jingxi has made a comeback and has a good chance of winning the championship.</p>

<p>Triple Jump This year, Yang Daogui and Wang Shilin have exceeded 14 meters. However, it is difficult to predict whether the results of these two can further break the national record of Situ Guang. If they can reach 14.50 meters or more this time, there is hope of attending the World Games next year.</p>

<p>Shot Put There are many talented people in the shot put event. Liu Furun from Hebei and Chen Baoqiu from Huazhong University have a good chance of winning the championship.

<h3 id="e204">A Brief Account of the Preparations <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>The Fifth National Games of the Republic of China in 1933 decided that the National Games would be held alternately in the capital and various provinces and cities every two years starting from the Sixth National Games. Also, because the Eleventh World Games in 1936 will be held in Berlin, Germany, in order to facilitate selection and training, it was decided that the Sixth National Games would be held in Shanghai. Wu Tiecheng, the mayor of Shanghai, then began active preparations. Because Shanghai is a major trading port, the focus of attention at home and abroad, it must have grand facilities. Also, according to the original schedule of the Far Eastern Games, the Eleventh Far Eastern Games should be held in Shanghai, China in 1937. Therefore, the construction of a complete municipal stadium is especially urgent. Mayor Wu made efforts to plan in the difficult financial situation of the city. The municipal stadium also started construction in the autumn of last year and has been completed as scheduled before the start of the conference. The magnificence is the crown of the Far East. This is the result of Mayor Wu's efforts.</p>
<p>The Sixth National Games was scheduled to be held from the Double Tenth Festival of this year to October 20 at the Municipal Stadium in the city center. The Ministry of Education hired 43 members to form a preparatory committee, including Liu Choubei, and hired Wu Tiecheng, the mayor of Shanghai, as the director of the preparatory committee, Pan Gongzhan, the director of the Municipal Education Bureau, and Hao Gengsheng, the physical education supervisor of the Ministry of Education, as deputies. Shen Siliang was the general secretary, and Ma Chonggan, Shao Rugan, Jiang Xiangqing, and Wu Bangwei were deputies. On April 8, the Ministry of Education convened all the preparatory committee members to hold the first preparatory meeting at the Shanghai Municipal Government. The preparatory committee was officially established at this time. The preparatory office was established in the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau. For several months, the preparatory committee members worked hard and spared no effort. The Sixth National Games also opened today at the Municipal Stadium, which cannot but make us admire the enthusiasm and efforts of the authorities.</p>

<h3 id="e205">Discussing the Competitive Landscape of Various Championships <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>Zhang Boling and most specialized scholars advocate for the elimination of championships and overall championships. Championships are indeed a form of superficiality, leading to arrogance among county-level athletes and instigating disputes. However, the greatest attention of those mobilizing, the masses, or various groups associated with the gains and losses of championships, still lies on the words "championship." Even if the name of the championship is abolished, its essence will surely remain. I dare to assert, in this "reckless talk," that I will casually discuss the competitive situation of various championships this time.</p>
<p>Track and Field All-Around</p>
<p>The previous championship was monopolized by Shanghai. This time, it can clearly maintain its past glory. In terms of talent, Shanghai is not particularly outstanding but is very average. Each of the four participants in each event has the hope of scoring points, at least not getting a goose egg in each sport. Although Liu Changchun is employed in Nanjing, he still remembers his homeland, now in enemy hands. Therefore, he still represents Liaoning in the track event under the name of the Northeast. This is undoubtedly a huge loss for Nanjing; otherwise, he could have scored some points with Liu Yingjun in the high hurdles.</p>
<p>Li Shiming of the Northeast has a good chance in the 400 and 800 meters. "Old Shanxi's" 10,000 meters has the possibility of monopolizing it. Lin Shaozhou (high hurdles) and Dai Shuguo (400 meters) from Fujian, after participating in the Qingdao summer camp, somehow merged into Shanghai, greatly strengthening Shanghai's strength. However, Cheng Jinguan, Shanghai's top sprinter, went to represent Jiangsu, which is another major loss for Shanghai.</p>
<p>Fu Jincheng of Malaya, originally from Shanghai, did not have particularly outstanding results, but after returning to Singapore, he has made significant progress in the 400 meters in the past two years, while his 100 and 200 meters remain average. Zhao Bingheng of Guangdong and Sun Yueming of Beiping are both somewhat famous in sprinting, but their strength is scattered.</p>
<p>Even if Shanghai doesn't get many first places from renowned athletes, its talent is so average, and its lineup is so solid that we confidently wish it the final victory.</p>
<p>Field events are the same as track events. Although "Iron Bull" Chen Baoqiu has gone to Hubei, it cannot affect Shanghai's throne. The only strong rival is Beiping.</p>
<p>The all-around event is also a contest between Shanghai and Beiping. Even if Zhang Lingjia wins first place in the decathlon, Shanghai can steadily secure victory in the five-man and two-man relays.</p>
<p>It is not possible to elaborate on the battle array of each competition here. In short, these three championships are meat in Shanghai's mouth.</p>
<p>Women's Track and Field</p>
<p>Speaking of women's track and field, Shanghai is guaranteed to win. Qian Hangsu, Li Sen, Pan Chu, Jiao Yulian, Chen Yachun, Lu Shu, and many other heroic women that I can't remember. The only strong rivals are Guangdong and Malaya, but the female generals of Guangdong can only run, not jump or throw, which is not enough to compete for the championship. Deng Yinjiao, a girl from Malaya, seems to be able to win first place in the long jump steadily. Her 50, 100, and 200 meters are all on the same level with the female generals of Shanghai and Guangdong. It depends on the competition. Ge Yulian's high jump is very promising, but it is not enough to break through the ranks of the Shanghai Iron Army.</p>
<p>Men's and Women's Swimming</p>
<p>Men's swimming is a battle between Hong Kong and Guangdong. The last champion was Guangdong. This time, the strength of both places is mostly from the previous few water generals who have made great progress. However, the personnel are scattered evenly, making it impossible to determine who is stronger and who is weaker.</p>
<p>In addition to Guangdong and Hong Kong, we must also pay attention to the water frogs of the South China Sea, Chen Weishui (brother of Yang Anni, the mermaid of the South China Sea), and Wang Yajiu, who have repeatedly broken national records and will have to compete with the athletes from Guangdong and Hong Kong. There are also three athletes from the Philippines participating, and it is said that their strength is also very good. Shanghai is much more dignified this year than it was in Nanjing, and the shame of getting goose eggs can be washed away, but it can only score points and is not enough to win the championship.</p>
<p>Women's swimming is undoubtedly monopolized by Hong Kong. Guangdong also has many good players, but it is not enough to shake its edge. It is a pity that Ms. Yang Ni of Malaya did not come; otherwise, Yang Xiuqiong would not have the sole advantage.</p>
<p>Football Championship</p>
<p>Football, the exciting football competition, especially caters to the taste of Shanghainese. "King of Football" Li Huitang has made a comeback. The preliminary contact has already been made, with a 10-0 victory over the Western police, driving the fans crazy. Shen Garden was so crowded that there was no room to stand. Because of the Linggu Games, Shanghai was lucky enough to win the championship, so this year Hong Kong is using its most elite team to avenge this defeat.</p>
<p>Hong Kong is determined to win. Li Huitang is also secretly preventing them from winning the championship. However, we must also beware of the mantis claws behind us. The Guangdong team is truly Hong Kong's only major enemy.</p>
<p>Guangdong and Hong Kong are certainly the most noticed. Shanghai fans have always been intoxicated by the famous generals of the home team, and the names of the players are truly like thunder, so familiar. This time, all the good players unexpectedly came. How happy and excited the fans are.</p>
<p>Malaya's football is also well-known. Two return visits in previous years have left a deep impression on people in the country. Moreover, this time, all the good players on the entire Malay Island have been recruited, and the strength can be imagined. Shanghai is already familiar to the local people. Although they have won all four practice matches, we still cannot be happy with the great enemy in front of us.</p>
<p>In addition to the above teams, Hebei should not be underestimated. The football skills of the Tianjin Chinese team have long been praised. It is an iron army of the emerging era of football in North China.</p>
<p>According to the order, the final semi-finals will roughly be Hong Kong vs. Malaya and Guangdong vs. Shanghai. Guangdong was originally the ideal final opponent for Hong Kong. Unexpectedly, the four knights are absent, and their strength is reduced. Guangdong believes that they are very lucky to meet Shanghai, and Shanghai also believes that they are pleasantly surprised. Therefore, the strength of the Shanghai and Guangdong teams can be said to be evenly matched, and both sides have great hopes. However, the call for the championship is undoubtedly the highest for Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Men's Basketball</p>
<p>Since the All-China Games championship team from Hebei was scattered, the situation of basketball has changed accordingly.</p>
<p>In recent years, Nanjing's basketball movement has developed rapidly. The National Sports Central Military Academy and other private groups have very strong basketball skills. Moreover, with the addition of national players such as Tang Hezhen and Li Zhenzhong from the former Hebei team, their strength is even stronger. This time, the men's basketball championship is definitely in Nanjing's pocket.</p>
<p>Only the Hubei team can compete with Nanjing. Unfortunately, the two teams will meet in the final. Qingdao is the most promising in the other part. In addition, Beiping is not weak, and Hebei has new entrants. Shanghai is lagging behind. Women's basketball has always been regarded as Shanghai's private property. This time, the confidence is still very strong, and the championship is seen as very easy.</p>
<p>Fujian is mainly composed of Qunhui. The team has gone on expeditions to the Philippines and Southeast Asia and has won great praise. The basic team of Shanghai, Liangjiang, was also defeated by it once.</p>
<p>At the Linggu Games, Shanghai narrowly defeated Fujian by one point in the final and won the championship. Thinking of the decisive battle at that time, I still have lingering fears. It is possible that the competition for the championship and runner-up this time will still be between Shanghai and Fujian, and the terrible situation may be repeated.</p>
<p>Tennis Championship</p>
<p>Like football, paper ball (tennis) is also very interesting. All the famous players from various places participated. Moreover, the method of winning the championship in this tennis tournament has been changed. It does not adopt a unit collective elimination system, but separates singles and doubles matches. It can almost be called a national tennis ranking competition. Therefore, it is possible to know who are the strongest singles players and which are the strongest doubles groups in the country. Therefore, the interest is even stronger, and the competition will inevitably be fierce. Everyone knows how good Xu Chengji, a famous player from Java, is. Since returning from the American participation in the Davis Cup this year, he has made rapid progress. There may be no rivals in the country, and he has a great chance of winning the singles championship. He also has great hopes for the doubles. Lin Wangsu and Chen Qian, left-handed generals from Malaya, are both proficient in this sport. Lin once defeated Lin Baohua and Qiu Feihai, which shows his skills. Chen won the Malayan singles championship last year, so he naturally has considerable skills. Therefore, he also wants to get involved in this championship.</p>
<p>Wang Wenzheng from Sichuan and Xu Weipei from Hong Kong should not be underestimated. Wang has defeated Qiu Lin since arriving in Shanghai, and Xu also slightly defeated Lin Wangsu in an exhibition match in Shanghai. Although the Shanghai team of the previous championship has two old generals, Lin and Qiu, they are old and declining, so there is no optimism for this championship. Looking at the women's team, there are also many heroes. The Shanxi team of the previous championship is still represented by the Wang Chunfu and Wang Zang sisters. Their strength is very strong and they can maintain their past glory. The talent of the Shanghai team is average. The Liang and Mao players do not need to be introduced. Everyone probably knows them. The Wei sisters are even more outstanding. They are determined to avenge the shame of Jinling. In addition, Nanjing, Beiping, Sichuan, Malaya, etc., also have many outstanding players, each with considerable strength. Who will win in the end? Let's wait and see.</p>
<p>Men's and Women's Volleyball</p>
<p>For men's and women's volleyball, a total of eleven teams in the men's division and eleven teams in the women's division participated in this championship. The men's preliminary round will have two matches at 1:00 PM and 3:00 PM today. The women's preliminary round will be held tomorrow. The two matches today will determine the loose and crisp situation. In the future, Shanghai, Zhejiang, and Hong Kong will meet and become a head-on conflict. Women's volleyball has always been the private property of athletes from the South. Since the sudden change in the previous championship, Shanghai has become ambitious. However, a gentleman's revenge is not too late in three years. Therefore, the winner between Guangdong and Hong Kong must be the ultimate strong enemy. The Jiangsu team, which is composed of Wuxi and Suzhou, and the players such as Qu Meiying and Feng Yuzhen, are all veteran players for many years. Tell Shanghai to be careful and cautious.</p>
<p>Baseball and Softball</p>
<p>The baseball event is not yet popular in the country. The participants from various units are not as enthusiastic as those in other events. The National Games have had this competition since the third session. North China took the lead, and East China replaced it in the third session. The hegemony then shifted from north to east. In the fourth session, it shifted from east to South China and returned to Hong Kong. The fifth session was monopolized by Guangdong. A total of five teams from Hunan, Hebei, Shanghai, Guangdong, and Beiping participated in this session. There are a total of six matches starting at 3:00 PM on the 11th. Observers from all sides have high hopes for the Guangdong, Beiping, and Shanghai teams. There is a great triangular confrontation, but the strength of Hebei should not be ignored.</p>
<p>The women's (softball) event started in the fifth session. The first championship went to Guangdong. There are six teams participating in this session, namely Guangdong, Shandong, Nanjing, Hebei, Jiangsu, and Shanghai. According to the strength, although Guangdong has the ambition to maintain its hegemony, many teams are secretly vying for the championship, especially Shanghai, which has the greatest ambition. Without fierce battles, it is difficult to distinguish between the first and the last. The competition starts at 1:00 PM on the 11th, with a total of six matches.</p>
<h3 id="e206">Tennis Exhibition Match: Lin Wangsu and Carson; Stopped at 9-9 Due to Rain <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Tennis Club specially invited Lin Wangsu, a famous tennis player from Malaya, and Carlson, the singles champion of grass tennis in this city, to hold an exhibition match at the Kangti Road stadium at 3:00 PM yesterday. There was also a doubles match between Qiu Feihai and Wang Wenzheng against Yang Lunzhang and Ruan Guoying. The strength of Qiu and Wang is very different from that of Yang and Ruan, so it became a one-sided situation. As a result, Qiu and Wang won two sets in a row with 6-4 and 6-3. The next to appear was the singles match between Lin and Carson. At that time, the weather was not good, and it was raining like pearls, but it was still held in the rain. However, when the first set was tied at 9-9, it was getting dark, so it ended in a draw.</p>
<h3 id="e207">Units that Registered Yesterday <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>A group of 136 people from the Beiping team arrived in Shanghai the night before last. More than 270 people from the Shanghai team arrived at the venue yesterday morning. The remaining units, such as Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, Rehe, and Yunnan, have all registered. Only the Mongolian martial arts team is still on the way and may arrive tomorrow or the day after tomorrow. The Chahar unit has not registered as of yesterday.</p>
<h3 id="e208">National Table Tennis Competition Opens Tonight <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>The National Table Tennis Competition will start at 8:00 PM tonight at the Central Auditorium. There are eight units competing, including Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Shanghai, Nanjing, Qingdao, Tianjin, Macau, and Hong Kong. Last night, the China Table Tennis Company hosted a banquet at Huibinlou, and everyone toasted each other with joy and wished each other victory. Tonight, the athletes from the eight teams will first compete in a round-robin competition in groups. There are two types of tickets, 30 cents and 40 cents, which can be pre-sold at the Shanghai Table Tennis Federation on the third floor of the Jiande Association on Fusheng Road. The order of tonight is attached below.</p>
<p>First match: Zhejiang vs. Qingdao, starting at 7:00 PM</p>
<p>Second match: Hong Kong vs. Tianjin, 8:30 PM</p>
<p>Third match: Shanghai vs. Macau, starting at 10:00 PM</p>
<h3 id="e209">Method of Calculating the Overall Championship <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>In the fourth and fifth sessions, only the overall championship was set up, and there was no indication for the units with the most championship wins. Therefore, in order to increase the competitive interest of this session, the conference decided to add the overall second, overall third, and overall fourth in addition to the overall championship. The method of distinguishing them is to calculate the total number of points scored by each unit in various championships. The one with the most total points in various championships wins the overall championship, followed by the overall second, overall third, and overall fourth. If two or more units have the same total score, the distinction will be based on the number of championships won. If the number of championships is still the same, the distinction will be based on the number of runner-up positions won, and so on. If the total scores in the women's division are the same, the one who wins the track and field championship will win the overall championship, or the distinction will be based on the order of the track and field championship. This is also the biggest difference from the previous two sessions.</p>

<h3 id="e211">Mongolian Wrestling Athletes to Arrive in Shanghai on the 12th <a href="#e211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>According to Chu Minyi, the conference has invited Mongolians to Shanghai to perform wrestling. Due to the long journey, they could not arrive in time for the opening of the conference. The group of eight athletes is scheduled to arrive in Beijing on the 12th and will take the express train to Shanghai that night. They will perform wrestling techniques at the conference. Wrestling originated in Mongolia. During the Qing Dynasty, Han-Mongolian wrestling competitions were held every year. The conference has invited Mongolians to Shanghai to perform a demonstration competition for the wrestling athletes of various units in the All-China Games. It is said that the athletes all come from Outer Mongolia and have hair braids. In terms of technique, they are indomitable.</p>

<h3 id="e213">Guangdong Football Team Wins Big Against the British League; Tan Jiangbai Scores Seven Goals Alone, Comparable to the "King of Football"; Yang Shuiyi is Agile and Extraordinary <a href="#e213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>The Guangdong representative team played against the local British League team at the Shen Garden Stadium on Yanping Road yesterday. The streets were crowded with traffic, and the atmosphere was lively. There were about 8,000 spectators. As a result, the Guangdong team won against the British League team by a score of 12 to 0. The Guangdong team's coordination was skilled, and their performance was wonderful. Especially Tan Jiangbai was active throughout the field and scored as many as seven goals alone, which can be compared to the "King of Football." Others, such as Yang Shuiyi, were fast, and his shots were accurate. The central defender, Liu Qingcai, was stable and experienced and assisted the forward line a lot. The back line and goalkeeper had little to do due to the weak offensive power of the British League and had no special performance. The battle situation is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Jiangbai Opens the Scoring</p>
<p>When referee Chen Jixiang blew the silver whistle, the Guangdong team attacked with mutual passes to advance on the British team's goal. Qu Bingming took a flat shot from 20 yards, which was blocked by the British goalkeeper, averting the danger. The British right inside forward received a pass from the center back, dribbled a few steps forward, and took a powerful shot that brushed the post and went wide. It was extremely dangerous. Yang Shuiyi started from the flank, passed the ball to Tan Jiangbai, who took a powerful shot from about 20 yards and scored the first goal.</p>
<p>Jiangbai Scores Consecutive Goals</p>
<p>The British League was not willing to be outdone and launched a fierce attack on the Guangdong camp, holding on for about five minutes. Mai Zhaohan kicked the ball away to save it. The British right wing attacked again and hooked the ball back, but it was cleared by Xiao Dianlian. Liu Qingcai passed the ball to Chen Zhenhe in the middle, who dribbled straight to the British defense line and crossed the ball. The British defense was in chaos. Tan Jiangbai jumped out and scored again.</p>
<p>The British League Loses Again</p>
<p>After the British team kicked off, they launched a fierce counterattack. Xu Yahui was not fast enough to chase back, so He Zuoxian came up with an idea and hooked the ball back to form a corner kick. The British right wing took the kick, and the landing point was good. Mai Zhaohan jumped up and headed the ball to safety. Liu Qingcai quickly sent the ball forward, and there was another flurry in front of the British goal. Everyone was fighting for the ball. Tan Jiangbai fell into the net with the ball. The British goalkeeper was so eager to save the ball that he injured the back of his head and had to leave the field. The British League continued with only ten players. Then, the Guangdong team's center forward headed in the fourth goal. The first half ended.</p>
<p>13-0 at the End</p>
<p>After halftime, the British goalkeeper returned to defense, but the Guangdong team's offensive became even more apparent. The British team's position was completely trampled by the Guangdong team. Qu Bingming then scored three goals in a row, which made the British League angry and their counterattack became extremely fierce, surrounding the Guangdong goal, creating dangerous situations. Finally, Mai Zhaohan's header miraculously cleared the ball. Then, Tan Jiangbai scored the eighth goal with a clear and beautiful diagonal shot. Yang Shuiyi got a penalty corner kick opportunity and sent the ball in, which fell in front of the post. Tan Jiangbai jumped up and headed it in, scoring the ninth goal. Yang Shuiyi added the finishing touch and scored the tenth goal. Tan Jiangbai scored again with his head. Yang Shuiyi then scored another two goals with a diagonal shot. Finally, Tan Jiangbai took advantage of a mistake by the defender and scored the thirteenth goal, ending the game.</p>

<h3 id="e214">A Glimpse Through the Fog: An Ode to the Venue <a href="#e214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>On the eve of the Double Tenth Festival of the 24th year, fine rain and slanting wind suddenly swept from the black cloud cover, and the Sixth All-China Games, which was eagerly anticipated by the whole country, was about to open amidst a flower cluster. Around the venue, all the people from industry, commerce, academia, the military, the police, and everything else were busy with their own duties. On the way home, the rain threads formed a giant mist through the wind, blurring the vision. Although the weather was not good in various places, the scenery was excellent. This is written as a glimpse through the fog to celebrate the curtain of the Double Tenth All-China Games.</p>
<p>Workers are Busy with Setting Up: The construction of the Sixth All-China Games venue, the Shanghai Sports Stadium, was designed and planned before the Fifth All-China Games in the 22nd year. Two years have passed, which is not a short time, but due to the magnificent architecture and engineering, it was only recently completed. However, with the opening of the conference, the eyes of the national masses were focused on one place, and the environment was arranged to show its rich and solemn image in addition to its magnificent and grand appearance. Therefore, the conference set up arches around the four sides of the venue, interspersed with advertisements set up by various industrial and commercial entrepreneurs. The electrical craftsmen worked all day yesterday and completed the curtain hanging. As a result, although the wind and rain were still annoying last night, the pedestrians near the All-China Games site were like money, and the rainbow candles were as beautiful as books. The night scenery from the city center will certainly be much better than the noisy and clamorous foreign field during the All-China Games, and the thick atmosphere of British stupidity is still secondary.</p>
<p>Merchants are Busy with Treasure Troves: Around the inside and outside of the conference venue, commercial markets were set up. Major stores in Tianjin, Beijing, Guangdong, Jiangsu, and Shanghai have all set up branches here. It is bustling and bustling, and it is impossible to distinguish who is selling to whom, but the psychology of competing for treasure troves is the same. Only 70% of the entire market had been completed yesterday, but it was fully prepared yesterday afternoon. Clerks and apprentices were busy greeting customers and decorating with lanterns and colorful decorations, which were dazzling and illuminating for miles. The results of their busy work are certainly amazing, and it is also very convenient for guests and athletes from various provinces and cities.</p>
<p>Students are Busy with Forging: This conference brings together athletes from 38 units in one place. The opportunity is certainly rare, and the number of people is very impressive. Each reporting unit, although not necessarily determined to win the championship, all has the attitude of showing its excellent results. Everyone has to have it. Among the martial arts athletes from Henan, there is even a 60-year-old woman participating. Nine out of ten shots hit the heart of the target. She is fat and has a full spirit, with the air of a man. The three mothers and daughters who came together are quite like street performers. Yesterday, they tried arrows in front of the gymnasium and each shot four arrows, all of which hit the bullseye. Is it because the ancient land of Yu still has many female heroes? All the athletes in the venue will be encouraged, and the results of this conference will certainly have many good records. Therefore, what is called busy is not for personal fame and fortune, nor for the honor and disgrace of the unit, but for the efforts of the entire promotion of national sports.</p>
<p>The Military and Police are Busy with Order: The order of the conference was planned in advance and was very meticulous. However, because there were too many participants, the maintenance of order and the instruction of pedestrian traffic were also quite attentive. Therefore, the military and police were dispatched and felt particularly busy. After the meeting, although the time of adjournment was crowded, some problems could not be avoided.</p>
<p>After touring the entire venue, I encountered rain on the way home. Although it was not heavy, I could not help but think of murmuring curses to the sky. However, when I looked back at the brilliant lights and the spirits shrouded in thick smoke, it was like seeing flowers in the fog, so I wrote this record.</p>

<h3 id="e219">Diligence and National Salvation <a href="#e219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>— Shao Yuanchong</p>
<p>Written for the Double Tenth Festival of the 24th Year</p>
<p>At this time of collapse and division, when our land changes color, and year after year we barely endure this sorrowful Double Tenth National Day, what are the feelings of the Chinese people? At this time of disaster greater than the Eastern Jin and suffering deeper than the Southern Song, and external constraints surpassing those of Germany after the Great War, when we recall today, the day of the founding of the nation twenty-four years ago, with its brave and heroic spirit that moved heaven and earth and made ghosts and gods weep, and when all dangers and obstacles were not enough to deter our hearts, comparing this to today's holding of breath and trepidation, watching the faces of others to gauge their joy and anger, what are our feelings? However, today, at this time when the nation is on the brink of survival, to condemn bitterly would not help the current difficulties. What I want to repeatedly and repeatedly say to my countrymen is how to work together on the great cause of national salvation through practical and feasible paths.</p>
<p>There are countless ways to save the nation, but the main point is to enable everyone to contribute their efforts, and for these efforts to be balanced and universal, practical and effective. The cause of national salvation is a matter for every citizen, a common responsibility, so everyone must fulfill their responsibilities, cultivate themselves, and engage in diligence, laboring their bodies, their minds, their wills, and their beginnings. Reviewing the causes of past disasters and failures, why are politics corrupt, education abandoned, customs degenerate, and the people foolish? Why is there much talk but little order, much discussion but little success, much empty rhetoric but no understanding, much dabbling but no deep cultivation, and much starting and stopping but little dedication? All of this is due to the habit of laziness. The lazy fear difficulty and labor, seek ease and avoid hardship. Under this trend, government affairs are expedient, education becomes superficial, careers are valued for their appearance, work is considered humble and lowly, while material extravagance, gambling, and indulgence in sensual pleasures are everywhere. A person's spirit and time are limited, but desires are unlimited. The weakness of human beings is to love ease and hate work. Without restraint and correction, they will increasingly become lazy and not repent. Diligence gives rise to good intentions, laziness gives rise to evil intentions. At this time when the nation is in danger, the people are suffering, yet some are unmoved, only indulging in singing and dancing, wasting time and neglecting their duties. Can they be said to have a human heart? In the past, when Tao Kan was facing the dangers of the Eastern Jin, he took diligence as an example for all officials. If anyone under his jurisdiction was gambling, he would throw their equipment into the river, considering it a game for pig herders. But how many in today's court and fields can avoid being pig herders? Xi Zizhen said: "In a declining age, there are no talented ministers in the court, no talented scholars in the schools, no talented farmers in the fields, no talented craftsmen, and no talented merchants." Was he not speaking in advance for today? For thousands of years since the founding of the nation, there has never been a time without crises. However, looking back at history, all nations that were able to save themselves and revive were able to unite from top to bottom, exerting their spirit of worry and diligence to overcome difficulties. Those who succumbed to foreign aggression and never recovered inevitably became depressed and complacent, unable to feel shame and revive themselves. The lessons of success and failure are clear when we open the books. Is it not a clumsy proposal to speak of the meaning of saving the nation through diligence to our countrymen?</p>
<p>The way to govern lies first in correcting imbalances and remedying ills. Therefore, when the nation is extravagant, show it thrift; when the people are lazy, show them diligence. The essence of diligence lies in being diligent in spirit, diligent in time, diligent in life, diligent in behavior, diligent in seeking knowledge, diligent in service, and diligent in one's duty. These are the main points. If the spirit is not diligent, then there will be aimless agitation, nowhere to settle, and lazy behavior will manifest. One must attach one's spirit to a career, to knowledge, to self-cultivation, and then the spirit will enter the right track. If time is not diligent, it is wasted; if life is not diligent, it is extravagant; if behavior is not diligent, it is false. Furthermore, the rise and fall of modern nations is based on the level of the people's intelligence, and the foundation of modern nation-building lies in the development of academics, so diligence in seeking knowledge is fundamental. Given the corruption and decline of today's politics, education, construction, and all undertakings, as well as the decline of national consciousness, we must encourage everyone's sense of responsibility and be diligent in their own service and the duty of citizens, so that the spirit is revitalized and the ears and eyes are refreshed. This is urgent and cannot be delayed. In the Qian hexagram of the Book of Changes, the image is of self-improvement without cease, and the Book of Zhou praises King Wen for his diligence in state affairs, saying: "From morning until midday and afternoon, he had no time to eat, using this to harmonize all the people." Mencius praised the Duke of Zhou, saying: "The Duke of Zhou thought of combining the ways of the three kings to implement the four matters. If there was anything that did not fit, he would look up and think about it, continuing day and night. If he was lucky enough to find it, he would sit and wait for dawn." These are all examples of establishing a nation through diligence. Furthermore, like the ancients who were vigilant at cockcrow and Qian Liu who used a round pillow to remind himself, all those who achieved success and all rising nations have established the nation through diligence in ordinary times and saved the nation through diligence in times of crisis. A single thought of diligence or laziness can make the difference between prosperity and ruin. This is something we must deeply consider and remember.</p>
<p>In our country, there are many wise men in history who sought to govern the nation through diligence. However, the ones who most inspire our admiration are Dayu and Mozi. Dayu worked tirelessly to control the floods for nineteen years. After the floods were settled, he still repeatedly inspected the land to labor for the people's affairs, and he died at Kuaiji. Mozi endured hardship and physical labor, advocating frugality and moderation, in order to save the people and quell the chaos, even to the point of wearing down his hair and wearing out his heels to benefit the world without reluctance. His spirit of hardship is enough to criticize a declining age and set an example for later generations. If the people of the country could all aspire to be like Mozi and those in government worked hard to emulate Dayu, the atmosphere would change and customs would be transformed. By using the meaning of diligence to save the nation and the spirit of Yu and Mo to correct bad habits, the lifeline of national salvation and revival is truly tied to this.</p>
<h3 id="e220">A General Overview of China's National Strength <a href="#e220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Zhuohan</p>
<p>On this day when the world situation is extremely dangerous, as we commemorate National Day, patriotic citizens probably cannot help but think about the issue of national survival, considering the birth of the nation!</p>
<p>A national strength survey indicates a nation's ability to survive. However, in today's China, with such vast territory, and statistical survey work still in its infancy, how can we even talk about the publication of such documents? Moreover, domestically, the suppression of bandits has not yet been fully accomplished, and externally, we are being watched and spied upon. Even if we have some data, how can we disclose everything without reservations? Therefore, Chinese people who want to thoroughly understand the national condition or discuss national affairs feel a lack of sufficient reference materials. Seeking it from national histories, those after the dynasty change no longer reflect the true picture of a dynamic China. Seeking it from newspapers, it is fragmented and scattered, making it difficult to rely on. In recent years, domestic individuals discussing the national condition have, due to practical reasons, had to borrow materials from foreign-compiled "China Yearbooks." The drawback is that the original books are ignorant and erroneous, with no way to correct them. For those without the ability to read foreign language materials, individual material collection is an excessive waste of time and energy. Mr. Shi Liangcai, the former general manager of Shen Bao, recognized this and established a Yearbook Department within the newspaper, publishing the "Shen Bao Yearbook," hoping to collect as much material as possible within the realm of possibility, entrusting experts to select and compile it, and publishing a practical, general-purpose yearbook. The author co-edited this project, and over the past three years, has experienced many hardships. Generally speaking: the initial materials were either too incomplete or too inconsistent. Sometimes superficial phenomena could not represent the content, and some outdated materials had lost their value. When investigating and seeking materials from various parties, some were willing to answer, but contradictions were found when compared with other materials. Some were busy with their duties or cherished secrets, and did not reply at all. We exhausted ourselves in seeking and inquiring, doing our best to cross-reference and recalculate, and were fortunate to have the help of many experts who spared no effort. We were able to勉成 complete three volumes of the "Shen Bao Yearbook," turning the national affairs of each year into a comprehensive report, to contribute to all sectors of society that need this publication. However, each volume is over 1,300 pages, with word counts ranging from 1.5 million to 2 million per volume. Although such a massive work is convenient for examination, we dare not call it concise. Now, taking advantage of the celebration of National Day, we further summarize a selection of relevant materials, referring to various books. However, for those already published in the "Shen Bao Yearbook," we will note the original page numbers for detailed examination.</p>
<p>The following will explain the current situation of our country in three parts: territory, population, and national strength.</p>
<p>(I) China's Territory and its Geographical Advantages</p>
<p>Land is an important foundation of a nation. The reason China is called a great power is that its vast territory is already a factor. China's territory is over 4 million square miles, equivalent to over 33 million square Chinese miles. In square kilometers, the detailed number is 11,173,558 (The land section of the Yearbook contains detailed information on each province and region). This area is divided into twenty-eight provinces (with a total of one thousand nine hundred and forty counties and forty-five establishment bureaus), six municipalities directly under the central government, four special administrative regions, and 勞　two places. The exercise of rule can be called a great nation. The territory ruled by countries around the world, excluding Russia and England (including affiliated territories), even if France and the United States' territories are included, is not as large. To the east, adjacent to Japan, it is only about six percent of our territory (The Yearbook has a comparative table).</p>
<p>Here, let us first observe from a political perspective. Outer Mongolia and Tibet need no mention. The four northeastern provinces are in a state of subjugation. Xinjiang and Qinghai are either beyond reach or their governing institutions are not yet complete. The most politically closely related are only twenty-one provinces (The situation is clear upon examination):</p>
<p>Region Area (sq km) Percentage of Total Area</p>
<p>Total area of China 11,173,558 100</p>
<p>Five areas outside Xinjiang: Qinghai, Xikang, Tibet 5,360,367 59</p>
<p>Lost territory of the four northeastern provinces 1,285,069</p>
<p>Twenty-one provinces in the interior 4,528,122 41</p>
<p>Accordingly, the territory with which our country currently has close political relations is only 60% of the total territory of over 10 million square kilometers. How can it still be considered large?</p>
<p>Furthermore, how is China's national sovereignty exercised on its territory? Various countries have established many concessions in places like Beijing (Dongjiaominxiang), Tianjin, Shanghai, Hankou, Kowloon, and Guangzhouwan, like pieces on a chessboard. These are the bases of foreign economic and political power, no different from establishing many enemy states, extending their demonic hands. Even worse, in various coastal ports such as Shanghai and Tianjin, foreign warships and troops freely enter and exit, and we cannot intervene. As for ordinary foreigners, they are not subject to our rule wherever they go. In 1932, someone lamented at the League of Nations: China has no boundaries anymore! We all understand this sentiment!</p>
<p>Furthermore, in terms of land utilization, even if those twenty-one provinces were all good land, it would be fine, but unfortunately, there are still problems.</p>
<p>According to experts, the most beneficial altitude for human life is below 500 meters. 500 to 1,000 meters is not very good. Whether high ground from 1,000 to 2,300 meters can be developed is still questionable. Anything above 3,000 meters is equivalent to barren land. Then, let's look at the percentages of China's terrain (using the total area of the country as 100%):</p>
<p>Terrain Percentage Terrain Percentage</p>
<p>Below 500 meters 14 Plains 10</p>
<p>500 to 1,000 meters 18 Basins 16</p>
<p>1,000 to 2,000 meters 08 Mountains 09</p>
<p>1,000 to 4,000 meters 40 Plateaus 34</p>
<p>Above 4,000 meters 20 Mountain Ranges 30</p>
<p>From the table above, China's best land is only about 14%, and even with the next best land included, it is only about 32%, just one-third of the total area of the country. If calculated using plains and basins, it only amounts to 26%, and we still need to subtract about one-tenth of that for the four northeastern provinces, which is not even 60%. (Yearbook 23, B31; 24, B25) Therefore, if China's external troubles increase further, and the wealthy areas along the coast and rivers are invaded, only preserving the northwestern highlands would be even more dangerous than the Southern Song Dynasty's escape southward.</p>
<p>(II) China's Population Problem</p>
<p>In recent years, various surveys and estimations of China's population, although the numbers are not very consistent, are generally close to accurate at over 460 million (Yearbook 24, B89). During the Qianlong era of the Qing Dynasty, there was already a saying that there were 400 million people in China. Then the increase rate in more than 100 years has been 15%. Although in Xinjiang, Ningxia, Xikang, Qinghai, etc., the average per square kilometer is just over one person (Yearbook 24, B88), most of those are highlands, mountains, and deserts, where it is difficult for life to survive. The one-third of the land that is fertile and suitable for human life, estimated at 3,724,516 square kilometers, already has 415,180,541 people, averaging just over 111 people per square kilometer, a density much higher than in Europe and America. Excluding the area occupied by rivers, lakes, cities, and roads, the cultivated farmland, according to expert estimates, averages just over four mu per person (Yearbook B32), far less than the 52 mu per person in North America and 14 mu per person in Soviet Russia. A poor family with many children is the reason why China is trapped on the poverty line.</p>
<p>The result of population expansion only leads to three avenues for survival: (1) seeking colonies abroad, (2) developing domestic resources, and (3) vigorously industrializing, seeking markets abroad for surplus goods. If one examines the Yearbook materials, the first type is not even a dream for the next thirty to fifty years. Even the power of overseas Chinese will be eradicated (detailed in Yearbook 24, R5-16). And the northeast, which could be a place for domestic migration, is now lost, with many refugees entering the interior seeking a living. The second and third types are possible, but at the moment, they are like trying to put out a fire far away. Even if the political situation stabilizes immediately and industries are developed, even assuming that the population increase trend slows down in one or two decades, it will still be far from a more prosperous life. If the population increases further, it will be even more difficult. The land is small, the population is dense, and resources are lacking. Apart from using cyclical internal strife as a means of adjustment, there will only be a life of insufficient food and clothing. With a simple life, culture will naturally be unable to improve. National strength will also be difficult to develop upward.</p>
<p>(III) China's National Strength</p>
<p>The review of national strength can be divided into economic (i.e., survival ability) and social (i.e., defense ability). Here, we will only explain the survival ability below. (Regarding the latest situation on defense ability, due to military secrets, a comprehensive description cannot be given. The old one can be found in the Shen Bao Yearbook of the 23rd year.)</p>
<p>The resources for survival come from the land. China's land production is currently dominated by agricultural products, followed by mineral products.</p>
<p>The most important agricultural product at present is food, followed by cotton. The annual food production in the country is statistically as follows (Yearbook 20, K4, unit: thousands of 市 祖):</p>
<p>Actual amount of annual food production available for consumption in the twenty provinces and regions</p>
<p>Indica and Japonica rice 12,027,746 4,214,58</p>
<p>Wheat 458,208 339,074</p>
<p>Sorghum, millet, corn, sweet potatoes 801,681 472,801</p>
<p>Rice is milled into refined rice, each dan yields about five dou, and various foods must also be reserved for seeds and livestock feed, etc. The percentage of each food used for human food varies (Yearbook 24, K21), and the actual numbers are as above. The total population of the twenty-one provinces is 375,171,574 people, and each person needs about two and a half dan of rice or wheat per year, so:</p>
<p>There is an annual shortage of over 100 million dan of rice and wheat. Although coarse grains are supplementing it, the above is the normal situation, but in reality, there are frequent droughts and floods, and various foods rise and fall in price, so the annual imports of foreign rice, foreign wheat, and flour are not small.</p>
<p>Import Category Year 1 of the Republic Year 10 of the Republic Year 23 of the Republic</p>
<p>(Thousands of Dan) (Thousands of Dan) (Thousands of Metric Quintals) (Converted to Thousands of Old Dan)</p>
<p>Foreign Rice 2,700 10,629 7,711 == 12,919</p>
<p>Foreign Flour 281 4,649 == 7,790</p>
<p>Wheat 3,202 75 596 == 998</p>
<p>Total 5,905 11,463 12,956 == 21,708</p>
<p>(Detailed in Yearbook 23, 子74; 24, 子88)</p>
<p>The above three items imported in the 23rd year of the Republic amounted to over 12.9 million metric quintals, equivalent to over 21.7 million old dan. The imports in the 23rd year were relatively small. The annual imports from the 11th to the 21st years of the Republic were about twice as much. Imagine that 74% of the nation's households are farmers, who are not diligent in planting or expanding land, but still cannot provide enough for basic sustenance. Isn't this a serious problem?</p>
<p>Next is cotton production. China's cotton production in the twenty provinces in the 22nd year of the Republic was 22,393,000 市担, and in the 23rd year it was 14,895,000 市担. The import and export values are as follows:</p>
<p>Foreign Cotton Imports Domestic Cotton Exports</p>
<p>Value in Year 21 of the Republic (National Currency) Value in Year 23 of the Republic (National Currency) Foreign Cotton Imports 98,206,206,071 90,246,598 Domestic Cotton Exports 30,228,998 15,200,879</p>
<p>This is a shortage of raw materials for civilian clothing. If the imported cotton yarn, cotton cloth, wool, and other clothing materials are calculated together, the trade deficit in the 23rd year of the Republic is nearly 100 million yuan. This is a situation where the two major necessities of clothing and food cannot be self-sufficient.</p>
<p>Regarding the economic situation of farmers resulting from the above situation, the changes in tenant farmers, owner-farmers, and semi-owner farmers in the twenty-one provinces of the interior since the first year of the Republic are shown in the following table:</p>
<p>Farmer Type Year 1 of the Republic Year 22 of the Republic</p>
<p>Tenant Farmers 28% 31%</p>
<p>Owner-Farmers 49% 45%</p>
<p>Semi-Owner Farmers 23% 23%</p>
<p>This shows that farmers are gradually losing their land and becoming laborers. The reason for losing land is poverty, the income from farming is not enough to live on, or it is due to the influence of the current situation and the oppression of the gentry. As there are more and more tenant farmers, and landlords become larger and larger, social problems become more and more complicated. Let's look at the economic situation of farmers in rich areas such as Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui. According to Buck's survey, only 14% of the farmers in the eight counties under Zhejiang Province have a surplus, and 59% have insufficient income to cover expenses. Moreover, the average annual living expenses for each adult male farmer in 2,370 peasant families in thirteen locations in six provinces in northern and central China are only 49 yuan and 6 jiao. With such poverty, coupled with occasional exorbitant taxes, it is difficult for farmers to survive. Whether speaking from the perspective of bandit suppression or from the history of past turmoil, the problem of farmer poverty is the most important and must be solved. (Although cooperatives have become popular in recent years, with loans of about 12 million yuan in the 22nd and 23rd years, this is a way to fill small holes and cannot withstand the great floods of this year).</p>
<p>Regarding China's mineral resources, previous estimates by foreigners were too excessive. According to recent field surveys by the Geological Survey Institute, coal, although not abundant, is not very scarce either. Tungsten and antimony occupy an important position in the world's mineral production. Tin is also abundant. Unfortunately, although there are reserves of iron and petroleum, which are related to the strength of modern countries, not much is mined. Yearbook 24 (K4-24)</p>
<p>Reserves and Production of Important Minerals (unit: million tons)</p>
<p>Mineral Type Reserves Production Imports Exports</p>
<p>Coal 248,287 32 1</p>
<p>Iron 1,182 10 0.4 0.7</p>
<p>Petroleum 3,274 Barrels 1,000 barrels 2,411 Gallons 10,000 gallons 200,000 gallons</p>
<p>Diesel —————————————————————— 230,000 gallons ———-</p>
<p>China's coal reserves rank second in the world. However, calculated per capita, there are only 500 tons per person, less than the 10,000 tons per person in the United States, 4,000 tons per person in the United Kingdom, and 1,500 tons per person in Germany. It is only better than Japan's 100 tons per person. The recent coal production is about 3 million tons. However, the Fushun mine accounts for the majority. Since the northeast was seized, coal consumption relies heavily on imports. In the 23rd year of the Republic, the trade deficit was more than 4.8 million yuan. Cheap iron ore is exported from the north, while steel relies on imports. In the 23rd year, the trade deficit was more than 80 million yuan. Although there are petroleum reserves in the country, development is unfavorable. In the 23rd year, imports also amounted to more than 80 million yuan. Although there are many antimony, tungsten, manganese, and zinc, it is not possible to increase production even with mines, and production cannot be used domestically. If relying on exports, not only are we controlled by foreigners, but also our own treasures are used as raw materials for others, which is also unfavorable to the economy.</p>
<p>Next, the increase in survival capacity depends on industry and commerce.</p>
<p>Industry is originally the linchpin of modern national economic development, so the production of advanced countries is industrialized. Even for agriculture, although there are natural limitations, they can use science and machinery to increase production as much as possible. China has been promoting industry since its defeat in the Sino-Japanese War, and has been striving for industrialization in recent years. However, basic industries such as steelmaking, machinery manufacturing, copper smelting, oil refining, and acid-alkali production do not yet have a substantial foundation. The more active ones are nothing more than light industry and small industry. Let's compare it with various industries in Japan as follows. (Year 21, M226; Year 24, Ⅰ1-27, 41).</p>
<p>Industry China Plants Japan Plants</p>
<p>Textile Industry 695 21,277</p>
<p>Chemical Industry 261 3,695</p>
<p>Machinery Industry 225 6,738</p>
<p>Food Industry 405 12,728</p>
<p>Electrical Industry 56 2,508</p>
<p>The most developed is the electrical industry, but most of them are light bulb factories. Given the size of China, more than 500 electrical factories is not a large number. The textile factory numbers are based on a survey from the 17th year of the Republic, and if small factories are included, there are no more than 1,000 factories in total for silk, cotton, wool, and knitwear. Judging from the situation of large factories, it is also not very good. Let's look at the statistics for the 23rd year of the Republic:</p>
<p>Although there are many Chinese factories, their capital is not as thick as that of Japanese factories. However, many of the domestic yarns and fabrics are not enough to supply our clothing, and we still rely on large amounts of imports every year. For example, in the 23rd year of the Republic:</p>
<p>Imported Goods Converted to National Currency (Thousands of Yuan) Exports (Thousands of Yuan)</p>
<p>Cotton Cloth 26,782 8,767</p>
<p>Cotton 90,237 15,201</p>
<p>Cotton Yarn 2,939 31,294</p>
<p>Piece Goods 11,507 9,999</p>
<p>Rayon 6,404 —</p>
<p>Wool Yarn 12,732 —</p>
<p>Woolen Cloth 14,417 —</p>
<p>Trade Deficit: 99,767 thousand yuan</p>
<p>As for commerce, China is passive. For example, the transportation and sale of European and American goods rely on foreigners for procurement and cannot be directly exported. For domestic commerce, there is no tariff protection. In addition to foreign goods being imported at low tariffs, foreigners can also establish factories in various ports in the country, and Chinese businesses cannot compete. Last year's trade deficit was 494 million yuan, and the year before that it reached more than 730 million yuan. In this situation, how can the market not be declining? (Yearbook 24 　77).</p>
<p>The reason for the above decline in agriculture, industry, and commerce is (1) the instability of domestic order, with frequent man-made disasters in various places, and the lack of prevention of natural disasters, causing all kinds of businesses to be destroyed. Or they are affected by the economic decline and cannot be supported. (2) The shortage of capital. Various enterprises do not have strong financial resources, and are shaken at the slightest disturbance. (3) The lack of technical expertise. For example, the farming methods of agriculture, the work methods of industrial engineering, the efficiency of labor, and the lack of accurate cost planning, the refining methods are not detailed, and the intelligence, physical strength, and character of the workers are inferior, often leading to failure. (4) The short-sightedness of entrepreneurs, who are greedy for petty profits and unwilling to make long-term plans. And the government's protective measures are very weak. If state-owned and government-run, failure is even faster. Moreover, various businesses have complementary properties. Under the decline of one profession, it is not easy for one or two businesses to develop independently. Therefore, foreign capital cannot be utilized, and domestic expenses gradually flow to the cities, leaving a barren and lifeless interior. The domestic economy is gradually collapsing, the people are displaced, and the survival ability of the Chinese people is like gasping for breath in a consumptive disease. Is it not dangerous?</p>
<p>Furthermore, consider the means of transportation. In recent years, there has been considerable effort in building roads. However, when compared with other countries, the tools for developing agriculture, industry, and commerce, such as railways and shipping, are inevitably dwarfed.</p>

<h3 id="e221">The Course of the Abyssinian Crisis <a href="#e221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>— Feng Zhongzu</p>
<p>Abyssinia originally survived amidst the constraints of the great powers' conflicting interests. In 1906, due to the inability of the three major imperialist nations—England, France, and Italy—to reach an equitable distribution of interests in Abyssinia, they were compelled to conclude a Tripartite Treaty guaranteeing Abyssinia's independence. This treaty simultaneously recognized Abyssinia's independence and territorial integrity while mutually acknowledging their respective special rights in the country. In 1925, England and Italy planned to establish a secret agreement, with both sides tacitly consenting to further economic aggression in Abyssinia. Abyssinia nearly suffered the disaster of being partitioned. Fortunately, with the assistance of France, Abyssinia vehemently opposed this leaked information within the League of Nations, leading England and Italy to declare they had no intention of aggression, and the agreement was aborted. However, Italy's ambition to invade Abyssinia never diminished. It changed its strategy, hypocritically attempting to befriend Abyssinia. In 1928, it concluded a so-called friendship treaty with Abyssinia, stipulating that any disputes between the two countries should first be submitted to arbitration and promising each other not to infringe upon territorial integrity. Italy originally intended to use this to ingratiate itself with Abyssinia, in order to gradually infiltrate and seize power. Unexpectedly, the Abyssinian emperor did not allow Italy to meddle in everything, but instead buried himself in rectifying internal affairs and strengthening national defense. As a result, this black nation became a source of concern for Italy.</p>
<p>The background of the Abyssinian crisis is roughly like this. The fuse that ignited this dispute was the clash between Italian Somaliland soldiers and Abyssinian troops in Wala-Wal on December 5 of last year. Prior to the conflict, the Anglo-Abyssinian boundary commission had been meeting there. According to reports from the boundary commissioners, the Italian troops in Wala-Wal were located within Abyssinian territory, thus this action had a provocative nature.</p>
<p>In January 1935, the budget of the Italian Colonial Ministry suddenly increased. Mussolini concurrently held the position of Colonial Minister and appointed General de Bono, who advocated conquering Abyssinia by war, as the Governor of "Italian East Africa" (so-called Italian East Africa refers to the connection between Eritrea and Somaliland, with Abyssinia in between!). Italian newspapers stated that the goal of this appointment was to resolve all issues between Italy and Abyssinia in one fell swoop. From the end of 1934, Italian troops and large quantities of military supplies were continuously transported to East Africa via the Suez Canal.</p>
<p>After the Wala-Wal incident, Abyssinia formally appealed to the League of Nations based on Article 11 of the Covenant. The British government strongly urged Abyssinia to negotiate directly with Italy. The negotiation was entirely based on the spirit of the 1928 treaty. Italy stated that issues other than Wala-Wal should not be included in the negotiations, and the Abyssinian people should salute and pay respects to the Italian flag and offer compensation and apologies. The Abyssinian government requested that all disputes between Italy and Abyssinia be submitted to arbitration and expressed its willingness to accept the mediation of the Council.</p>
<p>The situation deteriorated day by day, and Abyssinia invoked Articles 10 and 15 of the Covenant, requesting the League of Nations to quickly prevent war. In April, British and French representatives met with Mussolini in Stresa. The British representative originally brought an "Abyssinian expert" with him, but at the last minute, he did not have the courage to discuss the issue with the Blackshirt leader. During the special session of the League of Nations Council in April, Abyssinia's appeal was not discussed. In late May, the Council held a regular meeting and decided to form an arbitration committee composed of two Italians and two Abyssinians to investigate the responsibility for the Wala-Wal incident. The Italo-Abyssinian issue was delayed in the Council without any progress, although the Wala-Wal incident was clearly just a pretext, and Italian official newspapers openly stated that Italy's goal was to conquer the entire Abyssinia.</p>
<p>As of mid-July, 200,000 Italian troops had entered East Africa. Abyssinia continuously appealed to the Council and requested the Council to send neutral personnel to the area for investigation, but all requests were rejected. The four-person arbitration committee was shelved due to the breakdown of negotiations, which put the Council meeting at the end of July in an intractable predicament. Before the meeting, British newspapers and Parliament extensively discussed the British government's willingness to risk breaking with Italy to support the Council's measures. However, once the Council meeting began, Eden softened his stance and only passed a resolution that was even weaker than the one decided at the May regular meeting, asking the arbitration committee to continue the arbitration process according to Italy's wishes (i.e., not involving the issue of whether Italian troops had invaded Abyssinian territory in Wala-Wal). It was decided to convene a conference of England, France, and Italy, based on the 1906 agreement, to discuss the future of Abyssinia. It was also decided to postpone the entire issue to the Council's regular meeting on September 4.</p>
<p>During the Paris conference in August, British and French representatives proposed to Italy to cede the eastern territory of Abyssinia to it, while also adding many economic and immigration benefits. However, Mussolini was still not satisfied. He did not want these barren mountains; he wanted the entire fertile Abyssinia. Thus, the tripartite conference was declared to be dissolved.</p>
<p>After the failure of the tripartite conference, British Prime Minister Baldwin rushed back from his vacation resort and convened an emergency cabinet meeting. The situation was tense, and MacDonald said it was unprecedented since 1914. It was decided to propose sanctions to the League of Nations Council if necessary, while accelerating the expansion of the air force and concentrating the Mediterranean fleet. Britain's terror was understandable. Because it controlled Gibraltar, the Suez Canal, and the Red Sea, its navy dominated the Mediterranean, and it was the League of Nations' permanent and most powerful member. It also had close interests with Italy in East Africa. Once it expressed a tendency to impose sanctions, it only hoped that France could agree to its proposal. However, the result of the French cabinet's emergency meeting on August 28 expressed opposition to sanctions.</p>

<h2>Page 29</h2>
<p>At the Council meeting on September 4, the Italo-Abyssinian issue had reached a final juncture. The arbitration committee submitted a vague ruling, saying that neither party was responsible, and quietly ended its work. Italy harshly criticized Abyssinia in the meeting as a barbaric country, not entitled to join the League of Nations. The Abyssinian representative eloquently cited Articles 10 and 15 of the League of Nations Covenant, urging the League of Nations to take swift action to quell the war. As soon as the Abyssinian representative spoke, the Italian representative indignantly left the meeting, expressing contempt for "arguing on equal terms" with Abyssinia. This put the Council in a difficult position. Finally, it decided to stop the discussion and form a special committee composed of representatives from England, France, Poland, Spain, and Turkey to handle the Italo-Abyssinian dispute. After half a month of efforts, the special committee drafted a proposal, suggesting four points: (1) Abyssinia's public security should be maintained by international police constables; (2) The Abyssinian government should allow foreign governments to cooperate in economic development; (3) Reform finances; (4) Reform judicial, educational, and health affairs. For the above four suggestions, the League of Nations Council should each send one chief advisor to be responsible for their respective jurisdictions. After this proposal was sent to the governments of Italy and Abyssinia, Abyssinia immediately expressed acceptance, while Mussolini still maintained a tough stance, opposing the League of Nations' supervision, determined to exterminate Abyssinia.</p>
<p>With the failure of the special committee's mediation, the Council appointed a committee based on Article 15 of the Covenant to further deliberate and adjudicate on all issues. The committee was composed of representatives from thirteen countries: England, France, the Soviet Union, Argentina, Spain, Australia, Turkey, Romania, Poland, Portugal, Denmark, Ecuador, and Chile. Once established, it was delayed day after day, while the war clouds in East Africa became increasingly urgent. After the Italian cabinet meeting on September 29, a communiqué was issued, stating that military action against Abyssinia would be intensified. On the same day, the Abyssinian Emperor also telegraphed the League of Nations that a general mobilization order had been issued. On October 3, the Fascist Party issued a general mobilization order to invade Abyssinian territory. Only then did the thirteen-nation committee become busy, hurriedly convening a meeting to express its inability to help, and only waited for the Council to review the current situation. The Council then designated representatives from six countries—England, France, Spain, Romania, Portugal, and Chile—to form a six-person committee to study the situation based on the reports of the disputing countries and to determine who was the aggressor. Once the aggressor was determined, the League of Nations would consider sanctions.</p>
<p>At the same time, Britain stated its position, saying that it would resolutely support the League of Nations in imposing sanctions. If the League of Nations was ineffective, the British public would no longer pay attention to the League of Nations. Meanwhile, it sent Eden to Paris to consult with Laval on the implementation of sanctions. However, France still wanted to conduct negotiations with Italy. Therefore, the sanction methods still could not be compromised.</p>
<p>The League of Nations' six-person committee recently determined that Italy was the aggressor. The Council will proceed to consider the steps for sanctions. However, the Fascist army has already marched into Aduwa with great fanfare.</p>

<p>— Geng Ya</p>
<p>The Yangtze and Yellow Rivers have different effects; hence the saying that the Yangtze River is China's wealth-builder, while the Yellow River is China's squanderer. Since the fifth year of Xianfeng in the Qing Dynasty, the Yellow River has breached its banks at Tongwaxiang, then at Zhengzhou, and then at Puyang, with a fourth breach at the north and south dikes of Hebei and Shandong provinces in the previous year, each time inundating dozens of counties. Even before the old wounds have healed, this autumn there was another major breach at Dongzhuang in Yicheng, Shandong. From July 10th, the Yellow River diverted eight-tenths of the main stream southward, flooding over twenty counties in western Shandong and northern Jiangsu. Currently, the breach has not been blocked, the outflow is not smooth, and the turbulent currents are still like runaway horses, wantonly trampling upon living creatures everywhere, and no one knows where the disaster will end! The Yangtze River suffered a major flood as far back as the Qianlong era of the Qing Dynasty, and since the Republic of China, there have been three major floods in the 15th, 20th, and this year, with this year's disaster area being the widest and the disaster situation being the most tragic. When the Yangtze and Yellow Rivers both caused disasters at the same time, and various provinces successively became disaster areas, the reporter specially departed from Shanghai to inspect the severely affected areas of both rivers. What I have seen and heard has mostly been published in this newspaper. This trip lasted more than forty days, and I have arrived at most of the severely affected provinces and counties, obtaining a relatively deep common impression: that is, the Yellow River, known as China's squanderer, has had officials appointed to manage and prevent floods throughout history, and huge sums of money have been spent, but its wild nature has not been changed to make it follow the rules; and now the Yangtze River, which is supposed to be China's wealth-builder, also seems to be infected with the Yellow River's evil, not only has it repeatedly acted improperly, but it is feared that it will develop an increasingly unrestrained root. However, upon careful examination, I dare to say with a firm attitude that this is not because the inherent nature of the two rivers is absolutely difficult to manage, but because the human efforts in water management have not been fully exerted.</p>
<p>Please allow me to first discuss the causes of this year's Yangtze and Yellow River floods: (1) Excessive Rainfall. In the Yangtze River basin, during the transition between June and July, there were continuous heavy rains, causing the upper reaches of the main stream and the major tributaries, the Xiang River and the Han River, to surge simultaneously, converging in Hubei province; the lower reaches in Jiangxi, Anhui, and other provinces also experienced continuous heavy rains, making drainage difficult, and the water势汹涌, even more so than in the 20th year. In the 20th year, when the water level was at 47 feet 8 inches, the Hankou railway embankment broke, and the entire city was flooded. This year, the water level in Hankou rose to over 52 feet; the water levels in Yichang, Shashi, Jianli, and other areas were also more than a foot higher than in the 20th year. In the Yellow River basin, it rained almost every day in the entire first ten days of July. The rainfall had a small impact on the main stream above Longmen, but the tributaries such as the Wei and Luo Rivers in Shaanxi and Henan surged simultaneously, causing the downstream flow to suddenly reach 13,500 cubic meters per second. The area with the most rainfall was the Qinling Mountains. The rainwater north of the mountains flows into the Wei River, and the rainwater south of the mountains flows into the Han River (i.e., the Xiang River), causing particularly severe disasters.</p>
<p>(2) Silt Accumulation on the Riverbed. From the time the Yangtze River exits the Sichuan gorges and descends to Jingmen, it carries a large amount of mud and sand, rushing downwards. Wherever it encounters wide, shallow, and slow-flowing areas, silt is deposited to form islands, such as the Eight Great Sandbars downstream of Hankou (Chongwenzhou, Taiziji, Yaojiazhou, Madangzhou, Zhangjiazhou, Jiangjiazhou, Daijiazhou, Luozhou, etc.) and many ordinary beaches, which are scattered like stars, obstructing the water flow. Approximately 1.25 million tons are still flowing into the sea from the river mouth every day. Chongming Island was isolated in the sea during the late Ming and early Qing dynasties, but now it has gradually silted up and connected to the mainland. The Fan Gong Dike of the Chuanzhang River in Jiangsu was built by Fan Zhongyan of the Song Dynasty and named "Han Hai Tang" (Sea Defense Dike), originally to defend against the attack of sea tides. Later, because the land extended seaward by about one mile every sixty years, the Fan Gong Dike is now more than 130 or 140 miles away from the coast. All of this is enough to prove that the Yangtze River contains a considerable amount of mud and sand, and there is a possibility of deposition to increase the riverbed everywhere. The amount of sediment contained in the Yellow River water is even as high as 40%. The banks of the Yellow River are mostly composed of loess layers. On sunny days, they are covered with dust, and during rain, they become mud and enter the river, initially carrying sediment along the way. When the river exits Mengjin, the terrain on both sides is flat, and the water flow gradually slows down, so the sediment gradually settles on the downstream riverbed, increasing year by year. The current riverbed near the sea is more than 30 feet higher than the bottom of the Daqing River several decades ago. Last year's spring flood caused more scouring in the upper reaches and siltation along the way, and the riverbed was also about one meter higher. The water level is invisibly raised wherever the flood passes, so this year's flood has a water level that is half a meter to one meter higher than in previous years.</p>
<p>(3) Dikes and Other. If the water level of the rivers increases and the flow increases, increasing the height and reinforcing the dikes in advance may have the effect of turning danger into safety and preventing problems before they occur. If this cannot be done in normal times, and no effort is made to rescue the situation in an emergency, and the breach is further delayed, then the flooding will never end. This is common sense. The natural water storage lakes and滩地 of the Yangtze River and its main tributaries have been enclosed by local officials and civilians, the way to discharge water has been increasingly blocked, and the place to hold water has been increasingly reduced; in addition, the dikes are not high and solid, such as the "Six Hundred Zhang" main dike in Anhui, the height was not raised to the highest water level of the 20th year (still one meter short), so the river water overflowed; the breaches in the "San Si Gong" and "Shuang He Yuan" areas of the Xiang River in Hubei were due to the water conservancy officials using a contracting system to save money and delay things when building the dikes, etc. All these problems erupted at the same time, resulting in a major disaster in several provinces. But there is one thing worth mentioning: the water level in Hankou rose to 52 feet, more than 7 feet higher than the urban area, and almost exceeded the water level of the great flood in the 20th year (46 feet caused the Zhanggong Dike to collapse, and 47 feet 8 inches caused the railway embankment to collapse and the entire city to be flooded), but it was able to escape the disaster because the local military and civilians worked together to rescue the situation. When the water level rose sharply, the Zhanggong Dike collapsed one after another, and there were numerous dangerous situations. The more than 800,000 people in Hankou were panicked as if a great disaster was imminent. Yang Si__, the director of the Jianghan Water Conservancy Engineering Bureau, suddenly disappeared to avoid responsibility: during the great flood in the 20th year, the former director of the bureau挪作他用 the water conservancy funds for other purposes, resulting in no funds to add workers and purchase materials temporarily, and Hankou was reduced to a swamp. Whether the water conservancy authorities are responsible or not has such a huge impact. The upper reaches of the Yellow River come from the desert, carrying mud and sand, mostly meandering through the valleys, so there is no danger of breaching. Dikes only exist from Mengjin in Henan where the river exits the mountains. When the river suddenly descends to the plains at Wuzhi, it flows thousands of miles, and sediment settles everywhere, especially at the places where the dikes meet. The dikes in Henan Province are still safe and守穩 east of Lanfeng, but major risks have repeatedly occurred west to the border of Hebei. The riverbed in Shandong Province is gradually narrowing compared to Henan and Hebei, and the water level gradually rises here. Since the beginning of the Republic of China, there have been a total of fourteen breaches between Landui and Dongzhuang. The most urgent and risky project this year was identified by the Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission as a section of about 20 miles from Zhukou to Dongzhuang, and a special fund of 100,000 yuan was allocated to Zhang Lianjia, the director of the Shandong River Affairs Bureau, to raise the height of the section of the dike to the flood level of the 22nd year. The other dike projects in Henan and Hebei were also repaired in the same way and have been completed, but the Zhukou to Dongzhuang section was not completed. When the flood suddenly arrived, a major risk occurred. The people's revetments outside the dike were first submerged, and then the main dike was breached. The people, seeing that the Yellow River disaster was different from the Yangtze River, once flooded, it was boundless, and unanimously pleaded for rescue. Zhang gave the excuse that the water was fast and急溜, and there was a shortage of both labor and materials, unfortunately causing a big mistake. The ancients said, "People have the same heart, and hearts have the same reason." At the breach, all that was seen was theturbid waves in the air, and all that was heard was the sound of the water roaring. Was there anyone who did not embrace the wish to sacrifice themselves and enter the Yellow River to resist the waves and quickly make the river succeed? The rise and fall of water conservancy projects, and whether the person in charge is尽朋 or not, are extremely important. Zhang, the person in charge of the Yellow River breach, has been ordered by the central government to perform meritorious service to atone for his crime. Zhang, should you quickly be vigilant and self-motivated to engage in the aftermath of the breach?</p>
<p>This Yangtze and Yellow River flood has spread to Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui, Shandong, Jiangsu, Henan, Hebei, and other provinces, and the disaster situation in most areas is extremely tragic. According to the investigation reports from various parties, the number of counties affected by the disaster is: 51 counties and cities in Hubei, 37 counties in Hunan (including 15 severely affected counties), 48 counties in Jiangxi (including 13 severely affected counties), 13 counties in Anhui, 60 counties in Henan, dozens of counties in Shandong and Jiangsu, and several counties in Hebei. The disaster area is: 4,486,990 square kilometers in Hubei, with 70,237,155 acres of farmland submerged; 3,896,146 acres of embankments collapsed in Hunan, with 1,660,858 acres of submerged farmland; more than 30 counties in the severely affected areas of Jiangxi, with 5 counties reporting a total of more than 323,000 acres of submerged farmland; more than 410,000 acres of submerged farmland in Anhui; 938,160 square miles of disaster area in Henan, with 437,387 acres of submerged land; 600,000 square miles of disaster area in Shandong, with 8,154,031 acres of submerged land; the number of disaster victims is: 7.15 million in Hubei; 4.1 million in Hunan; more than 300,000 in Anhui; 3.5 million in Jiangxi; 3.7 million in Henan; and 5 million in Shandong. The amount of property loss is reported by only three provinces, with Hubei being 130 million yuan, Henan being more than 69 million yuan, and Anhui being more than 6 million yuan. The number of deaths is reported by only Henan Province, with a total of 5,273 people. The rest are not detailed, especially the disaster area in Jiangsu Province is expanding, and there are no调资 reports on various losses, so they are all missing. However, according to the estimation of Xu Shiying, the chairman of the Central Relief Committee, the total area of water damage in Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, and Anhui provinces is estimated to reach 100,000 square kilometers, the number of deaths is more than 100,000, and the direct and indirect losses of public and private property are estimated to be no less than 500 million yuan. The other provinces such as Henan, Hebei, Shandong, Jiangsu, Shaanxi, and Shanxi, which have directly and indirectly suffered from the Yellow River disaster, do not have relatively整之 statistics, but based on the great flood of the Yellow River breach in Henan and Hebei in the 22nd year, the disaster area of 12,792 square kilometers and the 3 million disaster victims (this item alone is not as many as the number of disaster victims in Shandong Province this time), and the loss of property reached 200 million yuan, the actual loss must be several times more. In total, the amount of property loss in this Yangtze and Yellow River flood is so huge that it is indeed as Mr. Baker, the advisor of the National Government Relief Committee, said, "Such two or three floods can offset China's entire national debt." This is not an exaggeration. Then, this unprecedented huge disaster, which has harmed the vitality of the country and damaged the national economy, can still be estimated in道里?</p>
<p>The most urgent and important post-disaster issues currently facing us are the efforts to block the Yellow River breach and relieve the disaster victims. Blocking the Yellow River breach is for the sake of the people of Jiangsu and Shandong, for the sake of the national economy, and for the sake of the water conservancy system. All of these are urgent and necessary. If the breach is not blocked for a day, the flood will not recede for a day. The wheat planting this year is hopeless, and the spring耕 next year is also渺茫; and the extent to which the disaster area in northern Jiangsu will expand is even unbearable to imagine. Millions of disaster victims are呻吟 in a situation of life and death. If the able-bodied are unwilling to sit still, as previously advocated for food in Nanjing, or even鋌而走險 and become bandits, the harm to the country and society is feared to be far greater than the flood. Although the Yangtze River basin flood will recede on its own due to the terrain, the 14 million disaster victims are焦頭爛額,露宿餐風, and are still as before. The difficulty of disaster relief is not on the day when the disaster first occurs, but after the disaster has lasted for a long time; the most difficult time for the disaster victims is not at the beginning of the disaster熱烈, but on the day when the disaster聲寂滅. In the blink of an eye, autumn goes and winter comes, the days are cold and the nights are long, the voices of social disaster relief are gradually沉寂, and the local慈警捐欵 are also悉索殆盡. If it continues to 淡然下去, the disaster victims will inevitably suffer in the餓鬼地獄, or become路旁凍骨, is this the original intention of籌振? Old man Ma Xiangbo said: "The failure to save the disaster victims is既 the loss of the entire country; saving people today is also既 self-rescue in the future." Compatriots and籌振 agencies,其三復斯言!</p>
<p>The患 of water has been heard for generations, and each disaster should increase the understanding of disaster prevention planning. If time passes and circumstances change, then澹忘; or although practical water management methods are discussed, they are delayed; then天變 is无时, and water disasters are feared to increase with each year. Regarding the fundamental methods of水, Chinese and foreign water conservancy experts have discussed them; but to seek a thoroughly effective and lasting effect, based on the relationship between the Yangtze and Yellow Rivers 天时 地理 水性, and prescribe the right medicine, we should devote all our efforts to achieve the following four goals: First, dikes. In the Yangtze River flood, if the Xiang River dike is high and solid, then the nine counties of Tianmen, Hanchuan, etc. will never be completely陸沉 due to one or two breaches. If Hankou had not increased the height of the dike in advance according to the water level of the 20th year, and had not拼命抢險 in an emergency, then the tragedy of the entire city flooding in the 20th year would have been重演 in this autumn without mercy. The Yellow River breach has caused endless suffering, and the fact that it is due to the lack of solid dikes and the弊 of搶護 is昭昭 and need not be費矣. Second,淸源. The Yellow River flood is worse than the Yangtze River, but the Yangtze River water level has also been increasing year by year recently. This is because the water contains mud and sand作祟. To灭轻 the amount of mud and sand and澄淸 the water source, trees should be planted and forests should be created along the downstream banks, and alfalfa should also be planted. In the upper reaches, the provinces must also廣種 trees to protect the土壤 and prevent it from being雨水冲刷. 급驟短促的 rain,林木草叶, can directly缓和 the势, and减少 the沟河急剧奔腾. In short, whether植林 can控制 the大自然雨量,固不可必: 惟藉以减少淤垫河底的泥沙,盖可操之左券也. Third,分闢支流. Water volume is greatly increased,河身不容,分流以杀水势,固亦应急的办法. The only划一河而为数</p>

<p>流,在堤防上地面上既不经济,在事实上恐亦利少书多,得不偿失. Song Su Zhe said: '河性急则通流,缓则淤淀,既无东西皆念之势,安有两河并行之理.' Ming Pan Jixun also said: '水分则势缓,势缓则沙停. 水合则势猛,势猛则沙刷.' The views of the two are extremely真, which can be used as佐证. But we can choose a place to build a闸, or build a滚水坝, and wait for the water level to be high to a certain degree,可启闸放水,以分流量. 放水设法引导,殆有利无害也. Fourth,节制流量, 如废田还江,废田还湖, 清除沙滩,凡足以增加汇纳洪水容量者均属之. The most要者莫如于主支流的上游建筑水库,例如襄河为长江最大支流,在陕境环山叠嶂中,可修大规模蓄水池. 渭河为黄河最大支流,平时流量,不足三十秒立方公尺,潼关黄河流量为一百五十秒立方公尺,惟至大水时期,情势骤变,黄河祗一千立方公尺,渭河竟涨至一万立方公尺,谓为黄灾主因,良非无据. If we can also建一大水库 in the Baoji谷中 of the上游,使洪水有回漩停瀦之地,当时既可拦阻洪水,以减下游水患,以后亦可缓缓放出,藉资灌溉航运之用,此外,沿河水文记载,水位报告,地形测量,以及水利机关的完善组织,水利负责人员的公正遴选,并严明赏罚,以奖励功过等等,欲求整个水利功能的完美表现,凡上述诸事端,皆不可或忽焉.</p>
<p>In short, the question of whether the Yangtze and Yellow River floods can be managed effectively is密绵之联繁 with the national tax revenue, the national life, and the national economy. 群策群力以赴之,此其时矣。</p>
<h3 id="e224">US Water Management Projects <a href="#e224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>— Bu Ren</p>
<p>The basic conditions for water management are three: first, huge funds; second, specialized personnel; and third, overall planning and concerted cooperation. To achieve permanent water management effects, none of these three is indispensable. Since our country decided through the third and fourth political conferences to unify the various water conservancy agencies under the National Economic Commission, water conservancy administration has begun to be unified. This is indeed a good phenomenon for water management, but unfortunately, both funds and talent are lacking, so the fundamental measures cannot be implemented. When it comes to water management, the world considers the United States to be advanced. Recently, Chairman Zhang Qun of Hubei also spoke to the reporter Song Hua of this newspaper, saying that "the most important thing is to imitate the water management methods of the Mississippi River in the United States." The water management projects in the United States are indeed worthy of our country's reference.</p>
<p>The United States is currently using hundreds of millions of dollars, millions of workers, and overall planning under the guidance of specialized personnel to carry out its great water conservancy projects, directly preventing floods, protecting property, and indirectly developing hydropower, allowing people to obtain cheap heat, light, and power, and thereby alleviating unemployment. The recent projects worth mentioning are three things.</p>
<p>(1) Completion of the Boulder Dam</p>
<p>The Boulder Dam construction plan was passed by Congress in late December 1928 and was inaugurated on the 30th of last month. The site is located between the states of Arizona and Nevada. After the dam is built, the water area of the Colorado River on the border between the two states will increase by 582 feet. The dam is 750 feet high, the highest in the world, and has a water storage capacity of 30.5 million cubic feet. The dam is 1,180 feet long at the top, 45 feet wide at the top, and 650 feet wide at the bottom. It used a total of 4.4 million cubic yards of cement, which requires about 5.5 million barrels of cement. This dam stores the excess water from the Colorado River, providing irrigation for farmland, regulating the river for navigation, and protecting the fields in the Imperial Valley of Southern California from flooding, water shortages, and siltation. A large lake will be created behind the dam, about 115 miles long and about 145,000 acres in area. This is truly the largest reservoir in the world. The cement work of the giant dam was completed this spring, but the construction of the power plant and the installation of water turbines have not yet been completed. The minimum horsepower of the generator is 1.835 million horsepower. In the future, the income from the sale of electricity can repay the government's advance of 165 million yuan with a surplus.</p>
<p>(2) Commencement of Construction of Fourteen Major Dams in Ohio</p>
<p>Ohio is currently carrying out the Muskingum River water storage plan with a cost of $34.5 million. The largest project included in this plan is the construction of fourteen major dams. After the construction of these fourteen major dams, they can prevent chronic river flooding and mud and water siltation. Work has now begun, with about 3,000 workers, mostly hired from the unemployed class, using the latest giant soil-moving machines and crawler locomotives. The fourteen major dams are located within a 50-mile radius of the city of Massillon, all in the Muskingum River basin, with a total area of about 500 square miles. The benefited area is the most prosperous area of the state. They are all fertile land, densely populated, and have prosperous commerce. Among the fourteen major dams, the longest is the dam in Barriewah, 10 miles from Massillon, which is 6,300 feet long and 80 feet high. The second is the dam in Peak, west of Barriewah, which is 5,800 feet long. The construction plan for these fourteen major dams was launched 21 years ago after the great flood, but it could not be implemented due to a lack of funds at the time. Now, due to the relief of unemployment, it has been promoted. According to the current plan, of this $34.5 million, $22.5 million is allocated by the US Public Works Administration, $6 million is taken from local taxes, $2 million is subsidized by the state government, and $6 million will be planned by the highway department. If there is still a shortage, the federal government will pay for it under the item of building small dams. The entire project is managed by the US Army Corps of Engineers, under the direction of Army Major Sonnisville.</p>
<p>(3) Scheduled Testing of the Mississippi River Model</p>
<p>The giant Mississippi River model, which was赞成 with cement, has been completed under the guidance of engineers and water conservancy experts and will be tested periodically at the US Waterways Experiment Station to test the great flood of 1927. The model is 1,060 feet long, 168 feet at its widest point, and covers an area of 112,000 square feet, representing a true area of 160,000 square miles, and is the largest of all waterway models in the world. Such a large model represents only a section of 601 miles of the Mississippi River and a portion of the Gulf of Mexico; if it were to represent the entire river, the length of the model would have to be extended beyond one mile. During the flood of 1927, the dynamic water volume of the Mississippi River was 1.76 million cubic feet per second: the model test of this flood will have a dynamic water of 1.82 cubic feet per second. Eight years ago, after the great flood, the US Congress passed a bill to handle flood control projects with huge funds, and the Army Corps of Engineers was engaged in surveying and carrying out the work. This newly built Mississippi River model is the most important tool for them to experiment with. From now on, they will not only rely on precise calculations, but also use this model for practical testing. The堤岸 of the楼型 are higher than the实际築就的堤岸;待试騐的大水汎濫,将比历来发生者更烈. Not only this, since there is a model, the entire situation of the river is easier to observe than a局部观察, which goes without saying. According to the US Waterways Experiment Station, it was founded in 1930. Its main business is to build various models related to water conservancy problems for testing. When it was founded, there were only a dozen staff members, and now there are 365, of whom 113 are technicians and senior staff. The creation of this Mississippi River model is the biggest achievement of the Institute.</p>

<h3 id="e229">Construction Projects in Jiangsu Over the Past Year <a href="#e229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>
<p>— Shen Baixian</p>
<p>(Double Tenth Festival, Year 24)</p>
<p>In the past year, Jiangsu Province's construction projects have continued to prioritize water conservancy, followed by highway transportation. Regarding water conservancy: the Huai River Diversion Project is crucial to the overall water conservancy situation in Jiangsu Province. The proposal has been around for decades, and it is now being implemented, which is truly gratifying. Dredging the tail end of the Yi and Shu Rivers is a part of the Huai River Diversion Project, and its necessity is most urgent. It has already been organized and implemented in a timely manner. The levee of the Li Canal is the guarantee of life and property for the seven counties downstream. At the places where the canal bends and faces the current, earthen revetments should be replaced with stone to ensure permanent stability. The ports along the Li-Xia River that connect to the sea are the channels for western water to return to the sea and for tides to flow inland. Tide gates should be built to prevent and defend against this. These proposals have been around for many years and are now being implemented. Water conservancy in Jiangnan has always been the best in the country. However, due to the age and disrepair of river channels and culverts, it has suffered from a mix of benefits and problems. It is now being repaired on a large scale through work-relief programs. The annual repairs of the Jiangnan sea dikes have long been neglected, resulting in frequent damage to the dikes whenever there are storms. Now, after large-scale repairs, the annual repair system has been restored, which are all welcome signs of progress. These are the most prominent examples. In summary, in the past year, the province has excavated approximately 54 million cubic meters of earth for water conservancy projects. The number of workers exceeded 500,000. Out of the province's 33 million people, an average of about one in sixty people participated in the work, which can be considered a considerable effort. Regarding highways: Efforts are being made to ensure that the seat of each county government has a county road that connects to the provincial road, and to connect with important towns in neighboring provinces. In the past year, more than 300 kilometers of highways were completed, more than 200 kilometers of earthen roads were opened to traffic, and the construction of more than 90 kilometers of county roads in various counties was supervised. The following is a selection of the water conservancy and highway projects undertaken in the past year for reference.</p>
<p>(1) Water Conservancy</p>
<p>1. Preliminary Engineering to Open the Huai River Diversion to the Sea. The importance of diverting the Huai River to the sea has long been known to the Chinese people. The plan focuses on flood discharge, followed by navigation and irrigation benefits. The principle of flood discharge is to divide the water to the Yangtze River and the sea. The route to the sea takes the course of the abandoned Yellow River, which was decided and announced by the Huai River Diversion Committee. The original plan required more than 34 million yuan, which was too large and difficult to raise, so a phased implementation plan was developed. The preliminary engineering required the excavation of approximately 70 million cubic meters of earth and a cost of 16 million yuan. Due to the large amount of work and high cost, it could not be undertaken for a while. The provincial government and local people believed that this project was closely related to their interests, and the implementation could not be delayed any longer. After consultation between the provincial government and the Huai River Diversion Committee, it was decided that Jiangsu Province would raise the funds and carry out the project according to the preliminary engineering plan, by recruiting labor. The total budget, excluding the construction of gates, was initially estimated at approximately 7 million yuan. Sixteen million laborers were recruited annually from twelve counties, including Huaiyin, Huaian, Siyang, Yancheng, Funing, Jiangdu, Gaoyou, Baoying, Taixian, Dongtai, and Xinghua, to engage in excavation during the agricultural off-season. The project was to be completed in two years. On October 1, Year 23, the Huai River Diversion to the Sea Engineering Office was established in Huaiyin. The provincial government appointed Xu Xinwu as the director and Chen Hefu as the deputy director. On November 1, Chairman Jin led the staff to hold a groundbreaking ceremony in Yangzhuang, Huaiyin, and actively proceeded. This major project had no precedent, and the situation in each county was different, so the recruitment of labor was particularly difficult. At the beginning of the project, there were very few laborers actually present. In addition, due to the severe winter and the Spring Festival, the progress was slow due to the constraints of weather and personnel, and the work efficiency and results were not significant. Later, the provincial government convened a meeting of county magistrates and local people from the Huai River Diversion counties in the province to discuss the recruitment of labor, and decided on a promotion plan based on the principles of separate recruitment of labor, collection of funds, and joint recruitment of labor and collection of funds. In late February of Year 24, large-scale construction began. Laborers gathered, and the sound of earth rammers filled the air. The project progressed and improved every day. By the end of May, when it was time for agricultural work, the project was temporarily suspended. A total of 130,000 laborers had actually arrived, excavating more than 18 million cubic meters of earth. Recently, the busy farming season has passed, so on September 15, another meeting of county magistrates was convened in the province to discuss the progress. It was decided to resume construction on October 1. With improved facilities in the future, the progress will naturally increase, and it is expected that water discharge can be completed before the next busy farming season.</p>
<p>2. Dredging of the Tail End of the Yi and Shu Rivers. The important rivers in northern Jiangsu are the Yi, Shu, Si, and Yun rivers. If the Shu River rises, it will flood the Yi River; if the Yi River rises, it will also flood the Shu River. If the Yi and Shu Rivers both rise, they will become deadlocked. The downstream discharge is insufficient, and the water will flood the Si and Yun rivers, making the water flow even more chaotic and causing more severe damage. The Huai River Diversion Committee estimated that the cost of the renovation project would be no less than 20 million yuan. The provincial government considered its financial resources and weighed the importance of the project, deciding to start with the downstream to ensure smooth discharge, and to carry out the project by recruiting labor to save costs and speed up completion. In addition to the completion of the dredging of the North Sixth Embankment River in Year 22, the following projects were started in Year 23: (1) Xiao Shu River, (2) Shallow Section of the Total Sixth Embankment River, (3) Downstream of the Chaimi River, (4) Shaoxiang River. The total excavation volume was approximately 3 million cubic meters, requiring approximately 200,000 yuan in labor costs. In addition to the 180,000 yuan allocated by the provincial government, the funds were raised locally, and assistance was provided by relief and salt affairs agencies. The provincial government entrusted this project to the Huai River Diversion to the Sea Engineering Office for concurrent management, and the four counties of Suqian, Shuyang, Donghai, and Guanyun were directed to actively proceed. It was started in October of Year 23 and completed successively by the end of May of Year 24. More than 30,000 laborers were recruited. Although the funding was difficult, fortunately, all parties enthusiastically assisted, and officials and the people worked together, so the major project was completed as scheduled, which is truly gratifying. In Year 24, it is planned to select other urgent waterways for renovation, in order to permanently eliminate the suffering of northern Jiangsu from floods.</p>
<p>3. Construction of the Wangzhugang Tide Gate. The ports along the Li-Xia River that connect to the sea are the tail end of the Huai and Yun rivers, and are often threatened by the backflow of brackish tides. Building tide gates to store freshwater and resist brackishness is extremely important. The National Economic Commission allocated funds to build tide gates in Heduo Port and Doulong Port in Dongtai. Although the construction of gates in Wangzhu Port had been proposed for a long time, it had not been realized due to a lack of funds. In the spring of Year 23, the province felt that the matter could not be delayed any longer, so it decided to proceed. On March 10, an engineering office was established in Dongtai, with Yu Shufang as the director, who first went to the construction site to investigate the geology. After precise design, the total estimated cost was 154,000 yuan. Contractors were recruited, and the project began in mid-May. In the middle, there were difficulties, such as frequent bandit alarms, posing a threat of danger; the soil was hard, making construction difficult; and drought caused water leaks, making transportation difficult. The project was delayed repeatedly, and the two gates were finally completed in March of Year 24. After the completion of this project, the 1.8 million mu of farmland in the counties along the Li-Xia River will be better equipped to store freshwater and resist brackishness.</p>
<p>4. Replacement of Earthen Revetments with Stone Along the Jiangbei Canal. At dangerous locations along the canal, there have always been temporary bank protection projects made of firewood and earth, called "sweeping works." Firewood is easily perishable, requiring annual repairs, and the revetments need to be dismantled and rebuilt every three years, which is very costly. The original total length of the earthen revetments was approximately 9,300 meters. Except for the three locations of Dangjunlou, Miaoxiangkou, and Qigongdian, where Shanghai Huayang Relief Association allocated 120,000 yuan in the winter of Year 22 of the Republic of China to rebuild stone structures, there was still a total length of 8,485 meters. The Jiangbei Canal Engineering Bureau selected the most important locations and replaced them with rubble bank protection to ensure long-term stability. The provincial government raised 240,000 yuan and started construction in April of Year 24. Construction was temporarily suspended at the end of July due to rising water. The unfinished project will be continued after autumn.</p>
<p>5. Drought Relief Work-Relief Dredging Projects. In Year 23 of the Republic of China, Jiangsu Province suffered from severe drought, affecting a wide area both north and south of the Yangtze River. Among them, the disaster situation in twelve counties, including Liuhe and Liyang, was particularly serious. The provincial government raised 4 million yuan to carry out provincial and county projects to provide relief. These projects mainly focused on dredging rivers and repairing embankments, supplemented by the construction of gates and culverts. The provincial projects included dredging Chishan Lake and the Qinhuai River basin, renovating the Zhenwu Canal and Danyang Lian Lake, and dredging the Yili Canal and Danjinli Cao River. Work-relief offices were established in Jurong, Danyang, and Liyang, and Feng Dan, Chen Zhi, and Qiu Yuheng were appointed as the directors of each office. In October of Year 23, a survey team was organized to conduct surveys. The county magistrates of the relevant counties also served as deputy directors of the work-relief offices to assist in the recruitment of laborers. Construction started successively in December. By May of Year 24, the earthwork projects had been completed successively. The total excavation volume was approximately 7 million cubic meters. The renovation of Lian Lake, which had not yet been carried out, and the construction of the Mangate and other projects will continue this autumn. County-level work-relief projects were carried out in thirty-five counties, including Liyang, Yixing, Jiangpu, and Liuhe, which were more severely affected by the drought, providing subsidies for dredging rivers and opening ponds based on the severity of the disaster. The total length of the rivers opened was more than 700 kilometers, with an earthwork volume of approximately 7.5 million cubic meters. The total number of laborers involved in the provincial and county projects was approximately 200,000. In addition, this province has been promoting the dredging of rivers by recruiting labor in various counties since Year 21, and the results have increased year by year for three years. In Year 23, the counties both north and south of the Yangtze River engaged in Huai River Diversion and work-relief projects, and the results of dredging by recruiting labor were still considerable. The total excavation volume was more than 19 million cubic meters, and the number of workers involved was no less than 200,000.</p>
<p>6. Jiangnan Seawall Project. The Jiangnan seawall stretches for more than 500 li and serves as a barrier for more than ten coastal counties. The seawall in Taicang, Changshu, Songjiang and Shanghai are particularly dangerous due to their location at the confluence of the Yangtze River and the sea. Therefore, stone seawalls have been built to ensure safety. In recent years, due to the lack of annual repair funds, the project has deteriorated day by day. In the autumn of Year 20 of the Republic of China, it encountered an unusual storm surge, causing even greater damage. Although a follow-up project was undertaken, it was limited by funds and only the most urgent parts could be completed, providing only temporary relief. In the autumn of Year 22, it was hit by two more storm surges, damaging both new and old structures. The provincial government again raised 520,000 yuan in Year 23 and handed it over to the Construction Department to repair the most urgent parts first. This project started in the lower ten days of May. The project was affected by drought and shallow water, hot weather, and difficulties in transportation and construction. After rushing to repair day and night and working in many ways, all the dangerous sections were completed before the autumn flood tide. The total length of the main project was more than 4,800 meters, and the remaining funds were used to repair more than 1,700 meters of secondary dangerous sections. All were completed by the end of October. After the completion of the project, measures for the maintenance of the seawall were formulated, with an estimated annual repair cost of 100,000 yuan to ensure long-term stability. The annual repair project this year is being organized by the Jiangnan Water Conservancy Engineering Office, and is still based on the estimation and repair of the most urgent areas. For example, disorganized and missing rubble and wooden piles will be sorted out and repaired to prevent expansion. Rubble masonry bags, sparse piles, and masonry bags will be rebuilt as pile-stone structures as appropriate to achieve stability. In areas where the outer beach of the earthen seawall has collapsed and is close to the seawall body, pile stones and water barriers will be added as appropriate to provide protection. In the sections where the main seawall cannot be repaired, new structures will be rebuilt. This project started in August of Year 24 and is being rushed to completion.</p>
<p>7. Construction of the Beigushan Meteorological Observatory in Zhenjiang. After the great flood in Year 20, Jiangsu Province was followed by a severe drought in Year 22. Therefore, water conservancy projects were listed as the top priority for construction. However, when revising the planning and finalizing the plan, it was often felt that the hydrological data was not sufficient. Carrying out meteorological work became a matter of urgency, which led to the establishment of the provincial meteorological station. The director of the station, Gu Shiyi, prepared to build the Beigushan Meteorological Observatory in Zhenjiang to establish a foundation. The construction of the observatory began on National Day in Year 23 and was completed in March of Year 24. The cost was approximately 10,000 yuan. The observatory is four stories high, resembling a pillar of heaven or a bunker from afar, standing halfway up the sky, with a majestic atmosphere. After the completion of the observatory, important instruments purchased from England and Germany were also transported and installed successively. The study of meteorology in this province has thus begun a new era.</p>
<p>(2) Highways</p>
<p>1. Completion of the Zhengcheng Road Project. The Zhengcheng Road runs from Zhenjiang through Danyang and Wujin to Jiangyin, with a total length of 115.5 kilometers. After the completion of the bridges, culverts, and earth foundation, a 3-meter wide crushed stone road surface was constructed. It was fully completed in December of Year 23 and open to automobile traffic.</p>
<p>2. Completion of the Xihu Road Project. The Xihu Road runs from Wuxi through Changshu, Taicang, Jiading to Shanghai, with a total length of 129 kilometers within the province. A total of 149 bridges, 62 culverts, and 384 water pipes were completed successively before March of this year. In addition, the entire road was paved with a stone base and sand surface. Construction started in January of this year and was completed and open to traffic in July.</p>
<p>3. Completion of the Suchang Road Project. The Suchang Road runs from Suzhou to Changshu, with a total length of 39 kilometers. A total of 25 bridges, 1 culvert, and 60 water pipes within Suzhou were built successively before February of this year. In Changshu, 20 military bridges were built in Year 21. This time, they were rebuilt as formal bridges, and 7 more culverts were added, which were completed successively before March of this year. The entire road was paved with a 3-meter wide crushed stone surface, which was completed and open to traffic in July of this year.</p>
<p>4. Completion of the Sukun Road. The Kunhu section of the Sukun Road was built by the municipal government, while the Sukun section was built by this province. The total length of the entire section is approximately 45 kilometers. A 3-meter wide cinder surface was paved. A total of 61 bridges and 274 culverts were built, which were all completed in July of this year.</p>
<p>5. Completion of the Yangpu Road Earthen Road Open to Traffic. The Yangpu Road runs from Jiangdu through Yizheng, Liuhe, and Puzhen to Pukou, with a length of approximately 95.5 kilometers. In addition to the completion of the earth foundation by the county through the construction of the bridges and culverts in the Hepu section by the Liuhe County Government in Year 23, a total of 11 bridges and 389 culverts were built in the Liuyang section, which were all completed in October of Year 23. In addition, an active bridge was built on the canal, and a ferry was built on the Chu River. Automobiles can now travel from Yangzhou to Puzhen.</p>
<p>6. Completion of the Liwu Road Earthen Road Open to Traffic. The Liwu Road runs from Lishui through Tianwangsi, Jurong, Jintan to Wujin, with a total length of 95 kilometers. The earth foundation was built by the counties along the line separately through the recruitment or hiring of laborers. A total of 33 bridges and 477 culverts were built along the entire road, and one bridge was rebuilt. In addition, because the Litian section is a connecting line between the Beijing-Hangzhou and Beijing-Jiangxi roads, with a total length of 20 kilometers, a crushed stone surface was paved at the same time. All were completed in December of Year 23 and open to automobile traffic.</p>
<p>7. Supervised Construction of County Roads in Various Counties. The Zhenjiang section of the Zhenli Road is 13.5 kilometers long. Under supervision, the Zhendan Jinli Long-Distance Bus Company paved a 3-meter wide brick surface, which was completed in November of last year. The Wuyi Road runs from Wujin to Caoqiao in Yixing, with a length of approximately 31 kilometers. Under supervision, the Wuyi Long-Distance Bus Company paved a crushed stone surface, which was completed in November of last year. The Songshen Road from Songjiang has been completed. The Sumu Road runs from Suzhou to Mudu, with a length of approximately 12 kilometers. After the bridges, culverts, and earth foundation were built, a 3-meter wide cinder brick surface was continued to be paved, which was completed in July of this year. The Qingni Road is approximately 23 kilometers long. The bridges in the first section were completed long ago. Now, the five bridges in the second section have been built, and the road surface project is underway.</p>

<h3 id="e230">Double Tenth Address <a href="#e230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>— Zhou Shoujuan</p>
<p>Children, if you use many building blocks to build a house, stacking them one by one, if you are not careful, it will collapse and all your efforts will be wasted. Seeing how difficult it is to build a house with building blocks, you can know that building a country is ten or a hundred times more difficult and arduous.</p>
<p>Today is the Double Tenth Festival, the anniversary of the creation of the Republic of China by our revolutionary patriots. Over the years, countless patriots have sacrificed their lives, shed their blood, and sacrificed their families and lives for the freedom of the nation, finally creating this Republic of China and transforming a corner of the map and history of Asia.</p>
<p>If we flip through the calendar of the past year, we will constantly see the words "National Humiliation Day" jump into our eyes and pierce our hearts. Only on this day, October 10th, is it prominently written "Today's National Day Celebration." When we think of the great price we paid, we should know how precious this only National Day is!</p>
<p>Children, do not be disappointed that our motherland is not yet rich and strong. You should know that our predecessors have already undertaken the most difficult task for us, creating this Republic of China. The future is long, and it still requires our continuous efforts, holding a spirit of great fearlessness, and stepping forward step by step along the bloodstains of the predecessors, to make this Republic of China flourish and stand tall on the world stage, washing away all the previous humiliations, and creating a new and great National Day celebration in addition to this Double Tenth Festival.</p>
<h3 id="e231">National Day Commemoration <a href="#e231" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c231" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">231</a></h3>
<p>— Jin Xi</p>
<p>Children! What day is your birthday? What day is your brother's or sister's birthday? What day are your father's and mother's birthdays? How do you spend your own, your brother's, your sister's, your father's, and your mother's birthdays?</p>
<p>October 10th is the birthday of our Republic of China!</p>
<p>The Republic of China is several years older than you children. It is already twenty-four years old this year. Several years before the Republic, Mr. Sun Yat-sen and others felt that the autocratic system of the Qing Dynasty at that time was not good, so they united patriotic people at home and abroad, raised the banner of national revolution, overthrew the Qing Dynasty, and sacrificed countless patriots in the process. Finally, on October 10th of the year before the Republic, they overthrew the autocratic system and changed it to a republican system, abolished the Qing Empire and established the Republic of China. Everyone designated this day as National Day Commemoration, counting it as the birthday of the Republic of China. All citizens of the Republic of China should enthusiastically and jubilantly celebrate the birthday of the Republic of China!</p>
<p>However, on the other hand, I would like to ask all the children to pay special attention. Since the founding of our Republic of China, foreign aggression has become increasingly urgent, and the national power has become increasingly weak. Are you children just singing national anthem and talking about the story of the National Day, and considering that as celebrating the birthday of the Republic of China?</p>
<h3 id="e232">The Little Brother's Revenge <a href="#e232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>— Yan Chonglou</p>
<p>The little brother was born in a harsh environment.</p>
<p>After the little brother was born, his parents both died! The little brother grew up alone.</p>
<p>The little brother gradually grew up, but his environment did not improve, and his pain increased instead!</p>
<p>The little brother was surrounded by many mischievous children, who often bullied the little brother, especially one called Baldy, who often tore the little brother's clothes, snatched the little brother's candy, and wanted to take away all the little brother's property.</p>
<p>The little brother did not dare to resist at all, because those mischievous children were all very strong. Once, he argued with Baldy a few times, and Baldy actually beat him until he bled.</p>
<p>The little brother knew that others bullied him because his own strength was too weak! So he worked hard to exercise his body. He was also afraid that those mischievous children would find out, so he always secretly practiced hard late at night.</p>
<p>The little brother silently practiced hard for several years. Whenever his birthday came, he would always calculate his skills to see how much progress he had made in the past year.</p>
<p>The little brother felt that his strength was very substantial, so he strode into the mischievous children's team. He declared to the mischievous children that he could no longer tolerate their insults. The mischievous children were very angry when they heard this. Baldy was the first to run over to slap the little brother again. Unexpectedly, the little brother threw a punch and knocked Baldy down.</p>
<p>The little brother knocked down Baldy. The other mischievous children saw that the little brother had such great strength and were very frightened! Some apologized to the little brother, while others ran away in a puff of smoke.</p>
<p>On his birthday this year, the little brother wore his new clothes that no one dared to tear again, ate his candy that no one dared to snatch again, and celebrated his final success, his final victory.</p>
<h3 id="e233">Respect for the National Flag <a href="#e233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<p>— Li Boshu</p>
<p>The national flag is the symbol of a country, so we should love our country and at the same time love our national flag. Children, do you understand this meaning?</p>
<p>The Japanese children, they love their national flag very much. Every morning when they arrive at school, when they see the sun flag fluttering in the air at the school gate, everyone respectfully takes off their hats and bows to it. If they do not do so, their little patrol officers will immediately intervene!</p>
<p>The American children, wherever they are, when they see their national flag, will immediately raise their right hand, stretch out the middle three fingers, and give it a Boy Scout salute. It looks very energetic.</p>
<p>The French children have a special respect for the red, white, and blue (representing freedom, equality, and fraternity) tricolor national flag, which was exchanged for hot blood and dry bones.</p>
<p>Other children, like the British and German, are very respectful of their own national flags. Because they all love their national flags, they can unite and fight for their country. Can we Chinese children do that? Think about it!</p>
<h3 id="e234">Wipe Away Tears and Cheer <a href="#e234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Liang</p>
<p>Stop crying so sadly, stop crying so bitterly, what day is today?</p>
<p>Look, open your tearful eyes, that page of red letters on the calendar—"October 10th"—how bright it is, the flowers that burst out from the hot blood of the martyrs. From a piece of splendor, one can see the collapse of the "Aisin Gioro" throne, and the people released from thousands of years of autocratic iron dragon, singing the prelude to the song of freedom.</p>
<p>The festival woven by the heads of the martyrs, how great, how magnificent, hold back the little sorrow in front of you. Wipe away your tears and cheer.</p>
<p>This day, this only day of joy always belongs to us. We cannot forget the great sacrifice of the martyrs, and we cannot abandon this free road that the martyrs took at risk, and the many flowers and trees that were cultivated with hot blood along the road. Why don't we cheer for the birth of China?!</p>
<p>Everyone says, "China has been born for twenty-four years, with wind and rain every year, and the people are lingering on in suffering every day. The natural disasters they have suffered go without saying, and the threats from foreign races are enough to pierce their hearts. The country itself is like what? A piece of meat on the chopping board, a melon under a sharp blade… Dozens of fierce and poisonous eyes are never relaxed. The gunpowder atmosphere in the world is so thick, and there is a crisis for the weak everywhere… What is there to be happy about?"</p>
<p>But, if we are always so sad and depressed, what remedy can we do for the crisis? The cause created by the martyrs is not for us to enjoy in peace and comfort forever. It is true that there has been wind and rain every year, the road to freedom has become rugged, and the flowers of freedom have appeared to wither, but whose responsibility is this, whose business is it? Don't be decadent any more, cheer up, muster the strength of the Chinese nation, and continue to fight for freedom and equality with the world. Today we want to cheer, we want to sing, we cannot forget the birth of the Republic of China.</p>

<p>Twenty-fourth Double Tenth, national crisis increasingly pressing.</p>
<p>Front door resists tigers and wolves; back door welcomes thieves;</p>
<p>Looking around, the wilderness is vast, demons are lined up in rows.</p>
<p>Don't learn from the childish cries, but be bold and spirited!</p>
<p>The horse runs in front, the whip follows behind,</p>
<p>The reins are in human hands, and the grass is not allowed to be chewed.</p>
<p>Long hissing is unheard, indignation fills the chest.</p>
<p>Eventually, the reins should be removed, the mane shaken, and one should surpass!</p>
<p>National humiliation is not allowed to be mourned, what is the use of laughing at National Day?</p>
<p>A sharp sword pierces my heart, suffer the pain and do not cry out!</p>
<p>Fall down and climb up yourself, do not wait for others to grab you.</p>
<p>Nurture enough strength, and repay one for one!</p>
<p>Listen to the Italian song, what strange things:</p>
<p>To cut off Abyssinia, to brush Italian boots.</p>
<p>How ruthless the Italian heart is, how can the Abyssinian heart die?</p>
<p>Airplanes drop bombs, only as birds scatter arrows.</p>
<p>Resist to the end, national destruction is not enough shame.</p>
<p>What should we do? Black people are still like this!</p>
<h3 id="e237">Psychological Test for Children <a href="#e237" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c237" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">237</a></h3>
<p>— Hua Ling</p>
<p>What kind of person do you want to be in the future?</p>
<p>What will you do with your money when you have it?</p>
<p>This time, I conducted a very interesting test among my second-grade students. Now, taking advantage of the opportunity of publishing a special issue in this journal, I am publishing it. I wonder what the children reading this journal will think.</p>
<p>My second-grade students are fourth graders in the spring semester and fifth graders in the autumn semester. There are a total of twenty-seven students in the spring fourth grade, the oldest being fifteen years old and the youngest being ten years old. There are a total of thirty-nine students in the autumn fifth grade, the oldest also being fifteen years old and the youngest being eleven years old. These two grades were tested together, with a total of sixty-six students, but the actual number tested was sixty-two, because four students were on leave. Among these sixty-two children, fifty-one were twelve and thirteen years old.</p>
<p>The first test question was: What occupation do you want to have in the future?</p>
<p>The results of the test were: 28 teachers, 20 revolutionaries, 2 writers, 5 artists and musicians, 2 government officials, 3 military officers, and 2 scientists.</p>
<p>From this test, I feel that children have a very weak understanding of life. Because in China, we have too many teachers and too few scientists, but according to the test results, it is the opposite. Only two out of sixty-two people want to be government officials, which is a good phenomenon. But at the same time, no one wants to be a worker or a farmer in the future, which I think is of great importance to the future of the country and the nation. I hope that attention will be paid to this when compiling teaching materials in the future.</p>
<p>The second test question was: If I had one million yuan, how would I allocate and use it?</p>
<p>The results of the test were: 22 people would deposit it in the bank, 13 people would buy fields, land, and houses, 12 people would engage in charitable undertakings, such as disaster relief, opening schools, setting up hospitals, and running orphanages (all included), 4 people would donate to government and local agencies, 4 people would invest in commerce, 2 people would repair bridges, pave roads, build temples, and sponsor monks, 2 people would donate to the Volunteer Army, and 3 people would seek their own enjoyment.</p>
<p>From this test, I felt a great disappointment again. Why didn't any of our children think of using their funds to engage in industrial development and active construction projects? Among these sixty-two children, selfish and self-interested people still account for such a large proportion. Is this a good phenomenon? From this test, it can be seen that superstition only accounts for two out of sixty-two, which is a small success in education after all.</p>
<p>Today is National Day, and all schools are on holiday. I hope that all the children will answer these two test questions and ask your teachers to make a test form tomorrow for everyone to study together.</p>

<p>— Xu Gan</p>
<p>On this Double Tenth Festival of the Year of the Child, I can't think of anything to offer to the masters of the future. After thinking for a long time, I felt that the era of the future is undoubtedly the era of science; the younger brothers and sisters who are masters in the era of science need to understand science the most, so I thought of a name; scientific fairy tales. This name is fresh. In foreign countries, there are scientific novels, and in China, there are scientific essays; only scientific fairy tales seem to be very unfamiliar.</p>
<p>Fairy tales can probably be divided into two categories. One category is deeper, and the other category is shallower. The deeper one contains educational meaning: the shallower one is full of mythical colors. Foreign fairy tales, the former accounts for the majority, and they are all very good, such as Mr. Lu Xun's translation of "Watch" is the best example: the latter category, even if it is the latter category, theirs are at least more lively and interesting than ours. Chinese fairy tales, the former category is very few, and those that do exist promote old teachings of loyalty, filial piety, and chastity, which will harm children; the latter category is many, but they are no longer myths, but ghost stories, tiger stories, and snake stories; not only are they monotonous, but also terrible. I don't dare to believe that China has fairy tales that children can read.</p>
<p>For this reason, the cry to save the children still has to be shouted out; fairy tales, which have a major impact on the future of children, need a revolution! How to revolutionize? First, overthrow myths, ghost stories, tiger stories, snake stories, and stories of loyalty, filial piety, and chastity; second, create new and real fairy tales. What are new and real fairy tales? The first type is literary fairy tales; the second type is scientific fairy tales. Literary fairy tales cultivate children's appreciation of beauty; scientific fairy tales use new knowledge to arouse children's interest in exploring the truth. Between the two, the second type is more needed.</p>
<p>Dear children, let's all get up and work hard to preserve the light of the future!</p>
<p>— Sincerely wishing you, Cheng Meihong</p>

<p>— Ji Ping</p>
<p>The Spring and Autumn Annals have been changed to a "Children's Special Issue" for the National Day commemoration. This is our predetermined plan and the method stipulated by the National Committee for the Implementation of the Year of the Child. From now on, whenever there is a grand commemoration, we will compile and print a "Children's Special Issue", because children are the new life of the country, and there is hope in the future. We are guides for children, so studying children's education and compiling children's publications is particularly meaningful and interesting.</p>
<p>This time, we published a call for papers, and in the middle of five days, we received more than five hundred letters of contribution, one-third of which were children's works, and two-thirds were non-children's works; it is not easy for adults to pay attention to children's problems, and it is especially valuable that children themselves can be so enthusiastic. I spent two days carefully reading all the contributions, knowing that the psychology of the contributors can probably be divided into three types: (1) very optimistic about the future of the country, (2) very dissatisfied with national affairs, expressing negativity: (3) ideals are too high, too far from reality.</p>
<p>I tell you: The international situation is so tense, and domestic problems are so complex: you only care about the present and do not know the urgency of future troubles. It is inevitable that you have been negligent in your considerations. And people with short-sightedness blindly believe in the power of foreigners, and are often dissatisfied with the status quo. Although I can't blame you, things are not that simple. National affairs always have to be gradually improved, and it is not easy to take effect for a while. As for those with overly high ideals, instead of demanding perfection from others, it is better to reflect on yourself. In short, in the past few years, China has had internal disasters and external aggression. In a very difficult period, it has still made some progress. If it continues to work hard, there is indeed still hope. These are my personal thoughts on today's Double Tenth Festival.</p>
<p>Finally, I express my respect to all the contributors, but the space is limited and I cannot publish them all. Please forgive me.</p>

<h3 id="e244">How Shall the Nation Celebrate? <a href="#e244" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c244" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">244</a></h3>
<p>— Xiong Cheng</p>
<p>In the refreshing autumn breeze and warm sunshine, the National Day of the Republic of China in the twenty-fourth year has quietly arrived.</p>
<p>Thinking back then, the Premier dedicated his life to revolution, experienced eleven failures, and went through all kinds of hardships, finally creating the Republic of China!</p>
<p>"Hoping that the son will become a dragon", our Founding Father had the same ardent hope as us, hoping to abolish unequal treaties, overthrow imperialism, and make China increasingly prosperous and strong. Sun Zhongshan not only fulfilled his own mission, but also thought for future generations and formulated the Three Principles of the People and the Founding Strategy. He has done everything in his power. In principle, he should be able to "die in peace."</p>
<p>But how is China growing now?</p>
<p>For twenty-four years, the people's lives have been declining day by day; the Eastern Provinces have been lost, and civil wars have been going on for years; in four years, there have been two major floods, the worst in sixty years, with vast disaster areas and victims everywhere; rural areas have gone bankrupt, the economy has collapsed, banks and money shops have gone bankrupt, and shops and factories have closed down; the number of dropouts and unemployed people has increased sharply, and people's lives have fallen into widespread poverty and hardship.</p>
<p>The Premier worked so hard, but his descendants are so useless. If the Founding Father has a spirit, he will also cry bitterly in the afterlife, right? For more than twenty years, China has not gotten better, but has only gotten worse. How shall we face the martyrs? How shall we face ourselves?</p>
<p>What is there to "celebrate" this year's National Day?</p>
<p>The reason why China is in such a situation today is partly due to its own lack of progress, and partly due to the oppression of its powerful neighbors. From this point of view, the way to save the country and the people is still the same old tune: the whole country should urgently eliminate prejudices, unite sincerely, save useless waste, devote all the country's manpower and financial resources to resist foreign aggression together, and work hard on construction; the government should take the people's demands as its own, and the people should also unite under the leadership of the government.</p>
<p>"Only oneself can save oneself"! This is also true for our China. Relying on the League of Nations and believing in justice are all self-deceiving words!</p>
<p>Indeed, this year's National Day is painful and sad. But, it doesn't matter. As long as we can realize this from now on, and the compatriots of the whole country, based on the Premier's selfless will and the spirit of hard work, fight for the nation and the country. Any obstacles can be eliminated, any difficulties can be overcome, we have 400 million people, and we have 400 million warm hearts and iron heads!</p>
<p>Germany, the Soviet Union, and Turkey are the best examples in the world.</p>
<p>I am willing, I wish, today is not only the birthday of the Republic of China, but also the new birthday of the Republic of China!</p>
<h3 id="e245">Feelings on the National Day of the Twenty-Fourth Year <a href="#e245" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c245" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">245</a></h3>
<p>— Xing An</p>
<p>For the past four years, because the country has been in a time of national crisis, there has been no time to grieve, let alone celebrate, so they have all been spent in hasty commemorations. Today is again the National Day of the twenty-fourth year, and the National Government has announced to the whole country that everything will be held in accordance with last year's methods. The people of the country are delighted to celebrate this founding festival, although they feel that the country is still full of scars and have no heart to cheer, but October 10th, after all, has its important significance in the history of the Republic of China. Therefore, it is appropriate for everyone to express their congratulations.</p>
<p>But how should we express our congratulations? Holding commemorative meetings and writing commemorative articles are just formalities. For a true commemoration, the people of the country must fully recognize the current difficult situation of our country, jointly shoulder the responsibility of every citizen, and work hard for the country to save it from the storm. The future of China is full of crises and many disasters, so saving the country and ensuring its survival is the awareness that the people of the country should have today, and the revival of the nation depends on this. How can we live in a drunken stupor, not think of revitalization, and sit idly by as the country declines? As the saying goes, adversity builds the nation. The internal and external troubles of our country in the past few years may promote us to embark on the road to strength.</p>
<p>As for the strategy of saving the country and ensuring its survival, there is only one way, that is, self-reliance. The lessons of history tell us that the survival of a country depends on its own strength. Relying on foreign forces is enough to accelerate its demise, and at most, it can only survive for a while. Therefore, if our country wants to overcome its national difficulties and revive the nation in the future, the whole country must be united and have the greatest sacrifice and strive forward. We should use a firm spirit, brave behavior, and a hardworking attitude to work hard to save China. We must know that China is the China of 400 million people. If we don't work hard and save ourselves, who else will help us?</p>
<p>Since the establishment of the Republic of China, it has been twenty-four years of history. We have already suffered a lot of pain. But let's not talk about it. Looking at the current situation, the East African war has broken out, and the world situation is worrying. Next year will be another crisis year of 1936. With great disaster ahead, the people of the country should maintain the glorious history of the Republic of China, inherit the legacy of the martyrs, and prepare to shed blood for the country.</p>

<h3 id="e247">A Brief Discussion on Musical Comedy <a href="#e247" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c247" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">247</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Zhengyi</p>
<p>Liang Geli once said that the value of comedy can sometimes exceed that of tragedy.</p>
<p>Of course, we cannot generalize in this way. Tragedy exposes the dark and miserable unreasonable events, making the audience cry, making the audience sympathize, and making the audience develop a kind of jealousy from crying and sympathy towards the root causes of unreasonable events, and transforming from jealousy to anger and hatred towards the root causes of unreasonable events.</p>
<p>However, as the predecessors have said, all the ugliness, all the hypocrisy, all the fraud, and all the false benevolence and righteousness of reality, in the humorous and laughable form of comedy, make the audience have a real understanding of the ugliness, hypocrisy, and fraud of the end reality, making the audience laugh with tears, bending forward and backward, and in the tears, in the bending forward and backward, have a touch of contempt for the hypocrisy and fraud of reality, transforming from light disdain to contempt and heartache towards the root causes of unreasonable events.</p>
<p>Although comedy and tragedy have their own differences in the form of drama, in the details—for example, the former is light, bright, and relatively unrestrained, while the latter is calm, firm, and relatively solemn—and in the selection of themes, the effects they receive are no different.</p>
<p>Perhaps it can be said that the effect received by comedy may be more or easier than the effect received by tragedy.</p>
<p>Why? Some people may ask.</p>
<p>Tragedy is indeed more difficult than comedy in terms of the method of handling and the selection of themes. For example, if the method of handling is not careful, it is easy to make people feel depressed, bitter, and bored. If the selection of themes is slightly negligent, it is easy to fall into sentimentalism, venting, and even "showing off suffering and selling money."</p>
<p>But comedy is different, because the themes help a lot in the method of handling, and because the method of handling is convenient, many effects are obtained. At the same time, as long as it exposes hypocrisy, ugliness, and fraud, comedy is much more convenient than tragedy in the selection of themes.</p>
<p>With the help of the themes alone, the method of handling comedy and the effects obtained will be more and easier. Then, if the auditory help, which can best increase the effect of comedy, is added, the effect received by comedy will exceed that of tragedy.</p>
<p>The so-called auditory help refers to music with a rhythm that fits the content of the comedy and emphasized sound effects.</p>
<p>Comedy has already possessed the above-mentioned conveniences in terms of themes and methods of handling. If it can be handled without errors, it is easy to make people cry with tears and bend forward and backward. If music is added to the accompaniment and the vision is emphasized, then the quantity of the obtained effect will be considerable.</p>
<p>Therefore, the value and effect of musical comedy will exceed that of general comedy, and the value and effect of comedy will exceed that of general tragedy—of course, good content must also have a good form in order to obtain high value and great effect.</p>
<h3 id="e248">Actors and Personality <a href="#e248" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c248" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">248</a></h3>
<p>— Bang</p>
<p>Really, the most important thing for an actor is not the deep expression when laughing and crying, but to grasp the personality of the character in the play and give full play to it.</p>
<p>If an actor can firmly grasp the personality of the character in the play and fully perform it, then he or she is a successful actor. On the contrary, if one or two scenes of crying and laughing are performed well, but the personality of the entire character in the play cannot be firmly grasped and fully developed, then he or she cannot be considered a good actor.</p>
<p>Personality is like a person's soul. If you don't grasp the soul of the character in the play, it is impossible to play the character in the play successfully.</p>
<p>After watching the test screening of "Metropolitan Scenery", I first put forward the acting skills of the actors here. Several actors are new to the screen, but it can be said that they have all grasped the personality of the characters in the play very tightly. Whether they are new or old actors, they can all clearly perform the personality of the characters in the play in "Metropolitan Scenery" because they know the relationship between actors and personality.</p>
<p>Zhang Xinzhu, a modern young lady who throws flirtatious glances, makes a fuss, crosses thresholds, and only knows how to dress up without knowing love, Tang Na, a sometimes silly, sometimes not very honest, supremacy-of-love advocate and young writer, Zhou Boxun, a clumsy old man who is afraid of his wife at home and puts on airs outside, Gu Mengho, a philistine who plays with women, acts like a tyrant, and puts on a big show, Bai Lu, a petite, naive, silly girl who doesn't know there is a young lady in the outside world, Lan Ping, a charming, gentle, and somewhat quick-witted Shanghai young lady, and Cai Ruohong, a secretary who flatters, blows, and trembles at the disposal of others, all grasp the personality of these typical characters very tightly. If these actors can be said to be successful, then it is successful in their grasp of the personality of the characters in the play.</p>

<p>— Jigong</p>
<p>I don't understand movies, but I like having them. Sad ones, happy ones, "Man Ku Ge" ones, funny ones, Chinese ones, foreign ones, as long as I have money in my pocket, I'll watch them all.</p>
<p>The other night, a musician friend called and asked if I wanted to see "Metropolitan Scenery"? Without having to pay. A movie to watch, and I don't have to pay, what could be better?</p>
<p>Half an hour later, I was sitting in the projection room of the Dian Tong Film Company. One after another, pleasant musical pieces, pile after pile of amusing jokes, swept past my ears and eyes, almost overwhelming my senses. But even though I was sitting on a simple bench, I forgot the pain of the hemorrhoids that had flared up again last month.</p>
<p>The music in "Metropolitan Scenery," the jokes in "Metropolitan Scenery," are very different from what I have heard and seen in Chinese films before, and even very different from foreign films. So I asked the friend next to me, but he just grinned and kept looking at the small screen, not hearing me.</p>
<p>I thought he was deliberately ignoring me, so I didn't ask him again. Later, when I came back, I asked another friend, and told him how the music in "Metropolitan Scenery" was arranged, and how interesting it was made. That friend then asked me, don't you know that "Metropolitan Scenery" invited many famous Chinese music experts to compose and score the music? Don't you know that "Metropolitan Scenery" invited many famous Chinese and foreign musicians to play the music? I replied that the musician friend who invited me didn't tell me.</p>
<p>He laughed and continued to ask me, "Do you know that comedy has low-level and high-level humor, 'hard slapstick' and 'ready-made jokes,' artificiality and naturalness, and so on?" I thought there was no point in lying to him, so I honestly said I didn't know.</p>
<p>He laughed even more. He then asked me, "Did you laugh when you watched it?" I said I laughed. "Did you laugh loudly?" I said I laughed loudly. "Did you laugh wildly?" I said I laughed wildly. He also asked me if I thought it was meaningful after laughing? I said that it was indeed meaningful, that's why I laughed, that's why I laughed loudly, that's why I laughed wildly.</p>
<p>My friend patted my head and said, "That's right, that's why Metropolitan Scenery is different from the Chinese and foreign films you've seen!" After saying that, he walked away.</p>
<p>What's right? What's different? I still don't understand. Okay, anyway, last time I freeloaded and didn't pay. I'll go see it again tomorrow to understand it clearly.</p>

<h3 id="e254">The Story of "Metropolitan Scenery" <a href="#e254" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c254" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">254</a></h3>
<p>At a small station in a certain village, farmers abandon their farm tools and flock to Shanghai. While waiting for the train, a magic lantern showman sings and tries to sell his wares. A family of four, a father, mother, nephew, and daughter, are drawn to watch.</p>
<p>What is projected in the lantern is "Metropolitan Scenery":</p>
<p>In the city, a young man, Li Menghua, prepares to go out, spending all twenty yuan he has to buy a woolen sweater for his lover, which he takes to give to her. When he arrives, he happens to see a man leaving her apartment with his head held high, who is none other than his rival in love, Wang Junshan. Entering the apartment, he finds the woman's father arguing with her mother over family finances. The father leaves in anger. The woman introduces Li. The father goes to his small pawn shop, which he co-owns, to raise money. The woman then invites the man to see a movie. Li is embarrassed because his pockets are empty. He pretends to go buy tickets first, and rushes to the pawn shop with his watch, pawning it for two yuan, which is just enough to buy the tickets. After the movie, they meet Wang Junshan again, who is much wealthier than Li. The woman accepts Wang's invitation, leaves Li, and gets into his car. Li is very disappointed, and can only sigh.</p>
<p>Li reads widely and writes a love letter to the woman. At the time, the woman is being asked to be a bridesmaid at a friend's wedding and is carefully planning her new outfit. All kinds of clothes, hats, shoes, and handbags are missing. She forces her father to go to the pawn shop to find a solution, but they still can't get what they need. Fortunately, her friend invites her to a clothing company to pick up a bridesmaid dress that they made for her as a gift. When paying the bill, she sees that the woman wants to order a coat, and quickly escapes. The woman then calls Wang, pretending to invite him to her apartment for noodles. When Wang arrives, he brings a birthday gift, but besides the flower basket, it is just a useless doll. The woman is disappointed again, so she invites him to a coffee shop to think of another clever plan. Unexpectedly, Wang says he can't go because of important business and sends his secretary, Mr. Chen, with her instead. When they arrive, they argue over who should pay the bill. Chen grabs her purse and puts it on the seat. The woman secretly kicks it with her foot, and it falls gently to the ground. Later, she goes to the clothing company to pick up the coat she ordered. When paying, she pretends to have lost her purse and angrily blames Chen for arguing with her about paying the bill. Chen has no choice but to pay for her coat first.</p>
<p>The woman's father, because the end of the year is approaching, wants to resell the items pawned in the pawn shop to an old goods store, but it doesn't work out. He then plans to re-pawn them at a larger pawnshop, but that also doesn't work out. He takes the items back to his apartment, and the family is happy, thinking that it's a great source of income. Who knew that all the items were old and worn out? The things the woman needed were still missing, so she called Wang again, pretending that the doll he gave her was damaged and asking him to send the receipt, intending to exchange the doll for other items. Wang sends the receipt, and she sees that it costs thirty yuan. She didn't expect the doll to be so expensive. Then the purse and shoes are no longer a concern, only a hat is missing.</p>
<p>Christmas is coming, and Li Menghua submits his love letter to the newspaper and gets two yuan for it. He uses this money to buy a hatbox and takes it to the woman's apartment as a gift. The maid sees it and happily tells the woman, thinking that she has gotten a hat. But when they open it, it's Li's pet dog. At this time, the woman is dressed up and plans to go dancing with someone. The dance hall requires one yuan for each ticket. Li empties his pockets to buy the tickets, and in his haste, he accidentally uses the pawn ticket as money. When he realizes it, he is very embarrassed. He searches Li for a long time and gets the remaining one-yuan ticket for her. After entering the dance hall, the woman orders expensive drinks. Li feels uneasy. Fortunately, he meets Wang Junshan's secretary and quickly seeks a way out. Before long, Wang arrives. After dancing happily, he takes her to his apartment, and the woman loses her virginity while drunk. At dawn, the woman returns home and meets her father, who is wearing a suit he retrieved from the pawn shop, leaving early in the morning, still thinking that his daughter is also going out early.</p>
<p>The woman's parents find out about her affair and learn that Wang is the manager of a tea shop. The woman's father plans to force Wang to marry his daughter so that he can solve the year-end financial problems. He goes to Wang's place with his daughter. At the time, Wang is making a deal with someone named Liu. Liu says that he must deliver the goods by the end of the year, and the woman's father also forces Wang to marry his daughter by the end of the year. The next day, Li Menghua hears the news of the woman's engagement and rushes to her place to question her. The woman angrily throws the love letter back at him. Frustrated, Li returns to his apartment and thinks about committing suicide, writing a suicide note to the woman. The woman goes to comfort him, and when she learns that he is still determined to take poison, she leaves in anger again. In the meantime, Li shouts loudly again, shocking the whole house. They gather and want to call the police. Li becomes anxious and says he will go to the hospital himself, causing a lot of laughter.</p>
<p>After Wang marries the woman, he gradually shows signs of financial distress due to speculation and extravagance. The end of the year is approaching, and he can't think of a solution. He goes to the market again to make one last gamble, but he fails again. He leaves a letter for the woman and runs away. At the time, his secretary has already had an affair with the maid and elopes with Wang's money. When the woman's father comes to visit, it is discovered that they have left, so they rush to the train station to chase after them, but the train has already left!</p>
<p>In a moment of urgency, they are suddenly startled by the sound of the bell, which means the train is arriving. All of the above is what is projected in the magic lantern. The four look at each other. They came to wait for the train, but now they don't know what to do.</p>

<h3 id="e255">This Year's National Day <a href="#e255" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c255" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">255</a></h3>
<p>— Qian Xu</p>
<p>The Republic of China has been established for twenty-four years, and it has passed twenty-four National Days. Although the environment of each National Day is different, it is almost always in a state of national instability and sadness.</p>
<p>Some may say that "celebration" must be carried out with a bit of joy and celebration to be meaningful. In recent years, our country has been plagued by internal and external troubles, natural disasters, and man-made calamities, pressing in on us from all sides. We are too busy with sorrow and vigilance to bring up any interest to make this meaningless routine celebration? Regarding this, I said in this publication on this day last year that the meaning of commemorating National Day is definitely not simply to rejoice and celebrate, but to take this opportunity to make a strong review, to see if we have lived up to the heroic blood of the martyrs, and the heads that have been thrown, and whether we have completed the mission of the martyrs? Therefore, writing about commemorating National Day on National Day is not just to decorate the season, but to take this opportunity to make another reminder.</p>
<p>However, what is the current situation of this year's National Day?</p>
<p>In East Africa, a war is being waged in which the strong oppress the weak. Italy stretches out its giant claws, opens its big mouth, and Abyssinia has become meat on the chopping board, but is making a final struggle. However, Abyssinia's relationship in the international community is very complex. Although the League of Nations Charter in Geneva has long been fundamentally ineffective, the great powers, in order to protect their own interests, will definitely not allow Italy to do as it pleases without asking. If the distribution of the spoils is slightly uneven, the contradictions between the international community will be fully exposed: the sound of cannons in the Mediterranean will ring out like the firecrackers of the old lunar New Year. The prelude to the Second World War will be fully opened at this time. Here, we must pay attention that when the first cannon sounds in the Mediterranean, our China will inevitably become a troubled time, which is unavoidable.</p>
<p>Domestically, the most alarming and tragic thing is the repeat of the great flood of the twentieth year of the Republic of China. The extent of the disaster and the suffering are even greater than in the twentieth year of the Republic of China. We only see Yanshi City completely submerged in the past, and Yaowan Town tragically declared sinking after that. The waters of the Yellow River, the Yangtze River, and the Grand Canal are flooding at the same time. Now it is autumn, and the water level has not only not receded, but there are still reports of breaches in the newspapers every day. The wounds of the twentieth year of the Republic of China have not yet healed, how can we endure this great calamity again? In addition, the state of continuous famine and recession is becoming increasingly serious, and the national economy and national resources have been greatly weakened, and have almost reached the point of no return!</p>
<p>But Shanghai, Shanghai is still the sky. Because of the great flood in the country, there are new things like flower selections for disaster relief and celebrity dance accompaniment for disaster relief. From today onwards, the unprecedentedly grand National Games of this year will open. Our masters and young masters can change to a fresh and exciting experience. However, I hope that while you are enthusiastically attending the grand event, you can look around and see the current crisis lurking on all sides.</p>
<p>Also, the lost land of the four northeastern provinces has not been recovered, but I don't know if we will still be able to read the "Farewell Letter of the Athletes of the Five Northeastern Provinces," which is "a tearful word that I can't bear to finish reading," at the end of this National Games?</p>
<h3 id="e256">A Family Letter <a href="#e256" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c256" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">256</a></h3>
<p>— Hua Mu</p>
<p>Having been away from home for a long time, and life is often trapped in the turmoil and restlessness, these dark years have gradually hardened the fresh and sensitive mood, and everything is seen as covered with a layer of dim color, feeling that everything is empty and cruel. Age and experience make me understand the meaning of my existence: although home is warm and lovable, at a certain time, the whip of life will beat you out, and under the spur of this iron whip, I endure some bitter days, and also lost the childish innocence. In the hardened mood, what I am concerned about is the scars of life on my shoulders, and what I can see is the black shadow of the whip and the suffering self. In these dark days, I am already very indifferent to home.</p>
<p>Although, I am not completely cut off from all connections with home. Although the difficult life has made my connection with home become indifferent, I know that this boundless home, separated by thousands of miles, still misses everything about me very much, and regards me as its future pillar. Although all my true news has long been swallowed and concealed by the shadow of life, this home is still just as concerned and uses various clever methods to send many sweet comforts to inquire about me and entangle me. This is a family letter covered with a lot of wind and oil stains that suddenly comes into my hands in a month or two.</p>
<p>At this time, I am often very moved. I will suddenly forget the dark days in front of me, and reverse the indifference to home. In the few childish words, not a single word does not deeply move me, sometimes even to the point of tears! This kind of emotional excitement cannot be suppressed by reason, and I myself do not understand why. This is completely a sudden rise and fall, unpredictable beforehand? It's like a lost child, suffering some fright and grievance, once thrown into the arms of the mother, under the comfort and tenderness of maternal love, not knowing whether to be happy or sad, only letting go of a cry, and the grievances in the stomach can be eliminated. The ancients said that "a family letter is worth ten thousand gold," and its meaning may be understood as such. Otherwise, I can't estimate where its "worth ten thousand gold" value lies.</p>
<p>Naturally, every family letter always tells me that it is well and safe, and finally concludes with the sentence "Don't worry, take care of the cold and warmth." From these words, we can see that they are intentionally or unintentionally conveying the family's warm concern for me. It always thinks that the wandering wanderer is often in the bleak and lonely inn, thinking of home and feeling sad. Although the facts are often the opposite, I not only do not feel disgusted or laugh secretly at this simple thought of home, but what moves me is precisely this ordinary place. In these unchanging colloquialisms, I taste that this home is ultimately infinitely warm and loving, its "human touch" is still pure and flawless, only it is always concerned about me and believes in me, in this vast and cold universe, it makes me still be able to touch some of the warmth of life. This is what makes me feel moved and shed tears for it.</p>
<p>However, I also believe in the cruelty of history. The fate of this family will always come to an end. Death, bankruptcy, disintegration, what great righteousness of ethics, filial piety and brotherly love, in the end, are all useless and will lose their original glory. I also know that these days, I have gradually been walking the path that history has assigned me, away from this family. I will also never have the ability to help the family that will collapse in the future. Because facts and experience have told me that the era of heroes creating the situation has passed, and the individual's ability is not able to drag history backwards. At that time, will I be saddened by this family that collapses under the cruelty of history? I think it is best to let me answer this with the mood and living environment of the moment.</p>
<p>However, in the immediate future, I do need to be able to receive one or two family letters full of warmth and love in the bitter days of a month or two, to warm up this hardened mood. Perhaps when there are no longer the words "don't worry, take care of the cold and warmth" written on the paper, but all are unbearable tragic narratives, then I can die this thought.</p>
<h3 id="e257">Miscellaneous Writings from a Water Village <a href="#e257" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c257" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">257</a></h3>
<p>— Li Ang</p>
<p>Water Chestnut Flowers</p>
<p>I loved to eat water chestnuts since I was a child, especially raw water chestnuts. The water chestnuts in my hometown have green skin, and the flesh is white, tender, and fresh. I always forced my mother or sister to peel them for me, because I was afraid of being pricked by the water chestnut thorns, just like the sharp thorns of a hedgehog. When I was fifteen or sixteen years old, I started doing it myself. Although I would still get pricked sometimes, or even bleed from my fingers, I already felt that the food obtained from pain was particularly sweet.</p>
<p>My hometown home, which I had been away from for seven or eight years, was much more haggard. The glowing yellow tung oil gate was gray and dim, and my mother's face was old. My poor sister died after giving birth due to a miscarriage. What else can evoke my childhood memories? Except for the water chestnut flowers in the pond in front of the house.</p>
<p>Whether in the hazy dawn or in the misty dusk, I always stand alone on the water bridge with a bit of infatuation, watching the clusters of water chestnut flowers swaying in the breeze near the pond. I love its secluded and unconventional style, I love its quiet and light purple. It is hidden in the sparse reeds and seems unwilling to compete with any kind of flower in the world. It stands on the emerald green water chestnut leaf plate, and except for the frogs croaking to it, it absolutely cannot bear the touch of people's hot hands. If there is a sudden rainstorm and the fallen petals are washed away, they also float quietly on the water surface, as if smiling, without revealing a trace of begging.</p>
<p>When my sister was alive, she also loved water chestnut flowers very much. She loved the fortitude in its gentle appearance.</p>
<p>"Li'er, rest for a few more days and there will be water chestnuts to eat." My mother looked at me at the door and said, "You love to eat water chestnuts the most."</p>
<p>However, I am about to be blown away from my hometown by the hurricane of life. I don't have time to wait for the water chestnuts to eat. I only hope that the water chestnut flowers will wither slowly. Maybe, on the journey of life, I will warm a light purple dream, and in the dream, I will see my sister's smile.</p>
<p>Small Fish</p>
<p>Since my father went away, no fish have been raised in the pond. First, no one feeds the fish fry, and second, no one guards the big fish. My old and weak mother cannot take on this task. Moreover, the situation in my hometown in recent years is not the same as before. There are often thefts and burglaries. Pigs and cattle will be stolen, let alone the fish in the pond. I remember when I was a child, I used to go to the water bridge with my sister to wash rice, and I would always see fish a foot long floating on the surface of the water to suck up the broken rice grains. Now, when I run to the water bridge alone, a feeling of emptiness suddenly surges in my heart.</p>
<p>The shadows of the big fish are gone. Among the aquatic plants and duckweeds, only groups of small fish, an inch or two long, are swimming busily back and forth. These are wild fish fry, and it is difficult for them to grow up for people to cook and eat. At first, I thought their lives were very secure and would never be captured by fishermen. Which diner wants to eat such small fish?</p>
<p>However, an unfortunate scene finally appeared. When I asked, "What's the use of you catching so many small fish?" and the fisherman replied, "Tie them to iron hooks to catch big fish!" I felt a kind of extremely cruel and perverse pressure. Is there any behavior in the world more sinful and vicious than "using the same kind to swallow and kill each other while enjoying the benefits"?</p>
<h3 id="e258">Perspective from the Window <a href="#e258" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c258" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">258</a></h3>
<p>— Hu Si</p>
<p>From the window, I can see the entire world outside. Any cosmic phenomenon, no matter how varied, can come into contact with me as long as it penetrates through an aperture. This is true regardless of the size of the window, even if it is as small as a pinhole, it cannot prevent me from communicating with the outside world.</p>
<p>Peeking at the outside scene from a limited aperture not only does not make the entirety of the universe disappear, but also concentrates attention, making the scene even clearer. It is very effective to use telescopes to spy on celestial phenomena or microscopes to spy on tiny objects. I often apply this principle to artistic views. If I rest my arm on the windowsill, my line of sight will of course be blocked by the window frame, but I can still see distant trees, houses, and people. I can see birds soaring, and I can see smoke rising from the chimneys; I can see the changes in the clouds in the sky, and I can see the wind blowing down the leaves, or the snow falling softly from the sky to the ground. In the city, I can see the hustle and bustle of the crowds in the street and the hurried creeping of cars; I can see the flashing of neon lights and all the dynamics of the city from a window frame. In the countryside, the hard work of the cattle, the labor of the farmers, all the cultivation to the harvest, and all the changes in the weather can be revealed in front of my eyes from a small window in a thatched cottage. If I live in the mountains, the protruding rocks, the ginger green of the mountain grass, the pouring of the waterfalls, and the lushness of the forests can all be seen at a glance from a small window. In addition, such as the mountain rain is about to come, the mountain valley is hidden, all the changes in the mountain scenery, all the faces of the mountainside, a window frame cannot prevent people from understanding and closely relating to the mountains.</p>
<p>From the small window in the cabin of a ship, even though the window is so small that it only has a small circle, the magnificence and beauty of the sea cannot be blocked from my intimacy. The undulation of the waves, the flying of the seabirds, the sailing boat with the sails full of wind,</p>
<h2>Page 39</h2>
<p>and the snow-white waves swept up by the wind, will all fly past and disappear from the window. Although the scene changes from scene to scene, like a movie lens that appears for a moment and disappears again. But who can say that that is not the true face of the sea, that that is not the magnificence of the sea? And who can say that the scene seen on the deck will be completely different from this? What's more, the sea seen from the window frame is even more interesting and more artistic!</p>
<p>Peeking at the outside world from the small window bars of a prison is even more exciting and has a more profound impression! You think that the gray and black walls, the cruel human composition, and the fierce faces of the soldiers and prison officials are so deeply understood for the whole prison! Fortunately, the window where I live is close to the workplace, or a small open space, or a small vegetable garden. The depressed heart that has been imprisoned for a long time, once it can see that small piece of sky, or a small piece of green vegetable leaf, or even just a small piece of wood, or a small piece of brick and tile, is so touching to look at when the ears and eyes have been hardened by monotony and dullness for a long time!</p>
<p>Naturally, if a person can build a villa in a place with good scenery and capture the essence of heaven and earth from the window, it is the most fortunate thing. Looking down on the big river villages and cities from the mountains, or looking at the sandy beaches and small islands from the coast, watching the sunrise and sunset in the morning and evening, and watching the tides rising and falling at midnight, it is so poetic and so artistic!</p>
<p>Watching the wind and rain from the window, watching the green will-o'-the-wisps, watching the bright neon lights, ... In short, watching everything in the city, watching the rich scenes created by mankind, if you can use the eye of an artist and get the angle of a movie camera lens, it is really an infinite method of appreciation, infinitely despising the world, and infinitely making people feel good!</p>

<p>It is indeed not worth it to have a pointless debate over this small matter, so the three words "fighting rounds" are returned in their original form, please check and accept them, Soft Foot. Moreover, I don't have Zhang Fei's ability to roar ferociously on the bridge, shouting: "Who dares to fight me a hundred rounds," fighting to the death, Foot Brother, do you agree?</p>
<p>However, to say it again, unfounded rumors are no different from slander; for example, if I also said: "It is said that Soft Foot is the brother-in-law of the dancer Chen Jingfang's flat board," or that he is "the illegitimate son of Tong Lei," and finally added a sentence: "Whether it is true, to be verified," written in this way (copying your Foot Brother's style), is it okay, Foot Brother, do you still think I'm reckless?</p>
<p>Submitting manuscripts to the news, submitting one manuscript to two places at the same time is barely acceptable, but Foot Brother publishing a manuscript in the Current Affairs New Broadcasting Machine, and then, after many days, publishing it quickly in the New Evening News, is no different from the so-called: "One woman promised to two men one after another," Foot Brother, do you also hold the family style of one woman promised to two men one after another?</p>
<p>Zhang Ru's nickname is Cai Di, as published in the Song Star Pictorial on August 1st, now Foot Brother is also looking for treasure to republish, is there any behavior of ripping off, please ask? I think the readers will also definitely know whether you have the value and need to copy and republish, I don't need to have too many pointless debates with you, I only hope that you move over the manuscripts published in the Current Affairs New Broadcasting Machine (or other broadcasting publications), because I am very welcome to read your copies signed by Soft Foot, the readers may also be very welcome to you! Ha ha! (Tong Lei answers Soft Foot)</p>

<h3 id="e264">"Curved Moon" Song <a href="#e264" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c264" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">264</a></h3>
<p>—To be sung by Hu Die—</p>
<p>"Curved Moon" is a five-act play, a collaboration between all the male and female stars of Mingxing Film Company, starring Hu Die. The song in "Curved Moon" was composed by Wu Cun. When the first act of Curved Moon opens the curtain, the lights in the entire theater go out, the music gradually rises, and the curtain slowly opens. On the stage, a bright moon hangs high, and the moonlight shines on the stage. At this time, Hu Die and Wang  Zhai are sitting back to back to the audience, enjoying the moon. When the curtain is fully opened, the music rises greatly, and then Hu Die begins to sing "Curved Moon." Under this kind of mood, undoubtedly the impression of "Curved Moon" is even more profound. The lyrics of "Curved Moon" are originally a well-known ancient poem, copied below to share with readers:</p>
<p>"The curved moon shines on Kyushu, some families are happy and some are sad: some couples share the same bed: some are wandering outside."</p>

<p>Double Tenth Festival, this is regarded by various companies as an auspicious day to sell lines. However, this year's Double Tenth Festival happens to coincide with the opening of the 6th National Games in Shanghai. In addition to watching Li Huitang, Yang Xiuqiong, etc., will the novelty-loving Shanghainese take the time to watch the new films of various companies? This has become a problem.</p>
<p>Mingxing's drama "Curved Moon" was originally said to be staged during the Mid-Autumn Festival. Temporarily, because the rehearsal was not timely, it was changed to be staged during the Double Tenth Festival. However, the Double Tenth Festival happened to coincide with the opening of the National Games, so for the sake of "business sense," it had to be postponed again. Now it is temporarily using "Night Blooming Jasmine" to block it, because the public opinion of "Night Blooming Jasmine" is not bad in all aspects.</p>
<p>For the Double Tenth Festival program, in addition to Xinguang still showing "Night Blooming Jasmine," the Great Guangming is re-screening Cecil B. DeMille's "The Crusades." Da Shanghai's Shirley Temple's "Little Linglong," and Nanjing's Garbo's "Broken Dreams," as well as Jincheng's "City Scenery," are all being advanced by one day or one session, so that they can do one more day or one more session of business, the method is very good.</p>
<p>Someone said: The film that is advanced by one day or used as a premiere is dedicated to the athletes of the National Games, which makes sense.</p>
<h3 id="e267">Broken Dreams <a href="#e267" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c267" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">267</a></h3>

<p>— Reporter</p>
<p>Since modern times. The art of architecture. Achievements are becoming more refined. Development is becoming more prosperous. It is not necessary to go far to the countries of Europe and America. Even in our country. All regions are competing to talk about construction. And construction is the first priority of architecture. Whether public or private institutions and residences. Are increasing day by day. Magnificent. All those who travel north and south. Can say it. No need to wait for statistics to be clear.</p>
<p>The technology of architecture. And the degree of civilization. Mutually promote each other. China is an advanced country in culture. Therefore, the technology of architecture. Whether palaces or bridges and city fortresses. All can fully express their achievements. However, since the late modern Western law. The more sophisticated it becomes. Therefore, those who speak of architecture. Abandon the old and admire the new. The ancient architecture of China. Has been reduced to an extinct school. Even for the structural materials of old buildings. Also seek to preserve and promote them. And for a time, the new buildings that sprang up in the country. Mostly borrowed talent from other places. Designed and operated by foreign engineers.</p>
<p>Since the Chinese Institute of Engineers was founded. All those who speak of architecture. And those who manage engineering. All gather here. Bringing together the nation's professional talent in one place. To explore its technology. To investigate its facilities. Therefore, those who speak of new architecture. Can find this as a sea of stars and a source of knowledge. And all of you also contribute new knowledge. To seek the development of the ancestral architecture industry. This is extremely valuable and rare in social academic groups. And its auxiliary role in our country's national construction. Its contribution will be even greater. Well-known and well-known. No need to repeat. Moreover, you gentlemen first paid attention to the planning of rules and regulations. Then you further advanced to materials and products. And domestic building materials. Then take the opportunity to rise in the market. To replace imported goods. From this point. Its relationship is not only limited to architecture. But it actually affects the rise and fall of the country.</p>
<p>This newspaper has always been committed to guiding construction. Especially knowing the importance of architecture. Then I have engaged in architectural weeklies. The Institute of Engineers. Also compiled this special issue with this newspaper on the matter of domestic building materials. Issued on the auspicious day of the Double Tenth National Day. Promoting domestic products. Should be promoted in direct proportion to guiding construction. Then all construction. Will not flow into a leaking cup. This is what the people of the country are striving for and sympathizing with. This newspaper has been able to serve in it. Is it not a fortunate thing to be cited? I will see the construction industry prospering day by day. Domestic materials are becoming more abundant day by day. And the country will also gradually reach the realm of prosperity and strength. I dare to use this as a saying. I hope to encourage the people of the country together. In its publication. To express this word. To serve as an introduction.</p>

<h3 id="e272">Shanghai Brick and Tile Industry in the Last 15 Years <a href="#e272" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c272" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">272</a></h3>
<p>— Liu Zixian</p>
<p>The quality of domestically produced bricks and tiles in our country is poor, and the rough manufacturing and abuse by bad households, with inconsistent sizes and thicknesses, greatly hinder the construction of houses. Therefore, new-style brick and tile factories were established.</p>
<p>In Shanghai, the Bairuihao Brick and Tile Factory imitated the French-style red flat tiles, followed by Taoxin of Jiashan, and Taishan Brick and Tile Factory. Yixing Huagai Brick and Tile Factory was also established at this time. The three factories all produced green and red flat tiles, which were sold in Shanghai and nearby ports. Later, Taishan established a new factory in Xinlonghua, South Shanghai, purchased new machines, built American-style round kilns, improved green and red flat tiles, and created various white bricks and colored bricks, opening a new era for the construction industry in Shanghai. Subsequently, Huaxin Brick and Tile Factory was established in Jiashan, specializing in the production of green flat tiles. Xinda Kiln Factory was established in Tangwan, Shanghai. Huada Brick and Tile Factory was established in Yejidun, Shanghai. Zhensu Huaxing was established in Kunshan. Lunxing was established in Jiashan. All of them built German Hoffmann continuous kilns, specializing in the production of machine-made bricks and red tiles. At the same time, American merchants established Suzhou Brick and Tile Factory in Suzhou, manufacturing various bricks and tiles. Belgian merchants established Yipin Brick and Tile Factory in Zhoujiaqiao, Shanghai, manufacturing machine-made bricks, red tiles, and hollow bricks. Hollow bricks are a new type of brick, and the people of Shanghai saw it for the first time. Soon after, Dazhong Brick and Tile Factory established a factory in Pudong, also mainly producing machine-made bricks, red tiles, and hollow bricks. Compared with Yipin, it can be called evenly matched. Recently, Southeast Brick and Tile Factory has risen in Minhang Punam, and the bricks and tiles produced are all considered to be of superior quality. Before Taishan changed the flat tiles, most of the goods on the market were not strong. Except for a few factories near Shanghai, the tiles produced by Hanyang Fucheng Yuji Official Factory, Hexing and other factories were all based in Shanghai. After Bai Taishan reformed the products, all brick and tile factories carefully manufactured them. Although the improvement of this product is limited to machine kilns, the colors are not uniform, but compared with the products of ten years ago, it is like heaven and earth. In recent years, various factories have also produced British-style flat tiles, Spanish-style barrel tiles, and Chinese temple-style barrel tiles, but the number used per square is large, and the value is high. It is not easy for noble houses to need this kind of goods.</p>
<p>Recently, the construction industry has been happy to use domestic bricks and tiles. Therefore, the products of various factories are changing with each passing day, and the leakage of blockage is not shallow. Since Taishan created the facade brick, all parts of the country have needed it. Recently, the factory and Kaishan, Xingye, and other factories have created extraction facade bricks, which are gradually being sold. In the future, they will inevitably be loved by people. Taishan and Kaishan have reproduced glazed tiles. Although this is an old industry in Peiping, it is one of the emerging industries in Shanghai.</p>
<p>For the item of fire bricks, apart from Kaiwai Ao, only Taishan, Southeast, and Duanhe in Shanghai can supply them. Other factories do not have this equipment. In recent years, industrial failures have occurred, and the use of yarn silk has declined, so the fire bricks used have been sharply reduced compared to five years ago.</p>
<p>Coal cinder bricks, formerly only the Hanyang Iron Factory, which was equipped with a coal cinder brick factory, could manufacture them. Although someone in Shanghai had set up a coal cinder brick factory in Yangshupu, it was closed down soon due to poor management. Recently, the Great Wall Brick and Tile Factory has created coal cinder bricks and tiles, which are gradually being sold, which is also an undertaking that the people of Shanghai have not seen. Except for Kailuan, Shanghai has no one who can manufacture this kind of brick. At the time, Taishan Brick and Tile Factory had made a certain number for the British Engineering Department, but because the cost was too high and the selling price could not be lowered, it could not continue and became an extinct offering.</p>
<p>Paving pottery tiles are produced by Tangshan, Qixin Porcelain Factory, Kailuan Mining Bureau, Yixing Kaishan, Brick and Tile Factory and other manufacturers. This is also a newly emerging thing in recent years. Mosaic floor tiles and wall tiles are produced by Qiyu, Yizhong, and Xingye factories. The quality is good, and it is not much inferior to imported goods.</p>
<p>Cement floor tiles were formerly best known for the products of Qixin Cement Company. Guanghua, Hezong, Fakang, and other factories also sold a lot. Recently, Huaxin Brick and Tile Factory has set up a cement floor tile department, equipped with new-style machines, and the products have been greatly reformed, with little difference compared to foreign goods.</p>
<p>In recent years, 19 out of 10 of the brick and tile materials are made by the Chinese themselves, which has reduced the leakage of blockage and is very gratifying. It is a pity that Chinese people like to follow in the footsteps of others when starting industries, and never open up another path. Among the bricks and tiles, such as drainage ditch tiles, electric wire pipes, flower-colored bricks for door heads, sand-gray bricks, and soft mud bricks, either the people of Shanghai have not seen them, or they are ordinary bricks, but the cost is low. However, they are rarely considered by the brick and tile industry. This is what is hoped that the various factories will work hard to research and promote them well.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Industrial Testing Institute is holding an exhibition of domestic building materials here, and all are welcome to visit.</p>
<h3 id="e273">The Use of Steel Castings in Construction <a href="#e273" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c273" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">273</a></h3>
<p>Steel materials from the Da Xin Steel Factory occupy a very important position in great buildings. In the past, when steel castings were not yet popular, for steel-framed buildings, in addition to using readily available I-beams and other types of iron beams, the joints were all made by cutting and bending iron plates to make them fit, then drilling holes and riveting them together. Since the steel casting industry gradually developed, various column feet (Pedestal), joint bases (Joint of Principle Rafter with End of Tie-bar), bearing blocks (Bearing Block under Girder and Girder Shoe), beam shoes (Girder Shoe or Saddle), base plates (Fixed Shoe-Flate or Bep-Plate), etc., were then made of cast steel instead of iron plates, which not only saved labor but also were more durable. The holding capacity of parts assembled from iron plates depends entirely on rivets and can never be as strong as a whole cast steel structure. In recent years, electric furnaces are often used to refine cast steel, making the quality excellent and removing impurities such as phosphorus and sulfur almost completely. Thus, after the steel companion is cast, even without rolling, its strength is extremely high, so more and more people are using it. Large-scale steel factories have not yet been established in our country, and those that have been established have also stopped supplying iron plates, relying entirely on imports. In order to promote domestic building materials, it is even more appropriate to use cast steel, without a doubt.</p>
<p>The application of cast steel in construction can sometimes use alloy cast steel to meet special needs. Adding a small amount of copper to ordinary cast copper will prevent it from rusting when exposed to the sky for a long time, and it can be used in construction where paint cannot be used to protect the steel from rusting. Adding a small amount of nickel to ordinary cast steel can increase the elastic limit (Elastic Limit), thus enabling the steel to withstand multiple continuous or alternating vibrations and pressures without breaking. It can be used in bridges or special building projects subject to vibration. Adding an appropriate amount of manganese to ordinary cast steel makes the steel hard but not brittle, and it can be used in places subject to extreme friction.</p>
<p>Cast iron is used as a support column in building materials because it can withstand pressure but not tension, and it is not tough. Unrefined cast iron has a tensile strength of only six to eight tons per square inch, but after legal refining, its tensile strength can be increased to sixteen to twenty tons per square inch, and its toughness can also be improved. If it is built into cement concrete, it can bend without cracking or breaking, so cast iron has a history of being used as rebar in reinforced concrete buildings.</p>
<p>Malleable iron (Mlalleable Lron) is used in building materials, in addition to being used for pipe joints, it is mostly used for parts of doors, windows, and railings, because it is soft and tough, not as brittle as cast iron. Its fluidity when melted is similar to that of cast iron, making it less difficult to cast thin parts than casting steel.</p>
<h2>Page 46</h2>
<p>Our country's cast steel and special iron manufacturing industry is in its initial stage of development in recent years. If ways can be found to adopt it, its uses will not only be limited to the several points mentioned above. Therefore, based on all the work records in the factory, I have extracted and described its application in the field of building materials, and I sincerely hope that the world's architectural experts will correct it, and that domestic comrades will enthusiastically promote it. Wherever wrought iron cannot be hammered and iron plates are not up to the task, steel castings can be used to fill the gap, so that our country's casting industry may be promoted in building materials.</p>

<h3 id="e275">Building Waterproofing Method <a href="#e275" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c275" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">275</a></h3>
<p>— Zheng Ruyi</p>
<p>Since modern times, the construction industry in our country has been advancing with each passing day, the projects are becoming greater, and the designs are becoming more detailed. Therefore, waterproofing and damp proofing have also been recognized as one of the important issues, because dampness in houses not only damages the appearance, but also hinders hygiene. In factories and warehouses, there is a risk of machine rusting and cargo mildew. As for buildings with underground pits and water towers, waterproofing projects are even more important.</p>
<p>Our country's construction industry has always regarded imported oil felt as the only waterproofing material. Almost all underground pits or roofs are explored and used. Since the invention of "Integral Waterproofing", waterproof slurry has gradually been used because it is simple, economical, and has lasting effectiveness.</p>
<p>Waterproofing projects seem very simple, but in fact they are not, because the underground pit waterproofing method is different from the wall waterproofing method, and the roof waterproofing method is different from the water tower waterproofing method. The required materials are not just two or three kinds to cope with. Now, based on my humble opinion, I will compile and describe the waterproofing methods for various parts of the house for the reference of architects.</p>
<p>(1) Roof</p>
<p>New Cement Roof—Use sufficient steel bones to prevent the house from moving and causing the roof to crack, and a suitable "drainage" layout. Integral waterproofing slurry should be mixed into the steel bone cement at 2% (calculated by the weight of the cement used). When installing, it must be hammered tightly. Apply a layer of 1...2 cement slurry one inch thick on the surface, mixed with 4% waterproofing slurry or waterproofing powder. Sprinkle water frequently within two or three days to prevent cracking. (In summer, use damp wood chips or turf to cover it.)</p>
<p>For cement roofs that have already been made and need waterproofing, (A) apply collodion oil three times (this material does not change the color or shape of the cement roof) (B) use oil felt (C) apply waterproof paint (black) twice.</p>
<p>New Galvanized Iron Roof—First wipe it once with dilute vinegar, and after it is dry, fill the top and seams with paper-reinforced paint. After two or three days, apply waterproof paint to the entire roof once. This paint can prevent leakage and rust. Very economical.</p>
<p>Leaking Roof—Whether it is an old cement roof, an oil felt roof, or a rusted galvanized iron roof, just fill the cracks with paper-reinforced paint. Then apply waterproof paint once or twice. Very simple and convenient.</p>
<p>(2) Walls:</p>
<p>New Cement Wall—Mix 2% waterproofing slurry into the steel bone cement. Mix 4% of this slurry into the fine sand on the outside.</p>
<p>New Brick Wall and Stone Wall—(A) Mix 2% waterproofing slurry into the mortar for laying bricks and stones. Do not leave gaps in the joints. (B) After the wall is built, clean the inside and apply damp-proof paint once. Then apply paper reinforcement on it.</p>
<p>Leaking Walls—(A) If you do not want to change the original color and pattern of the outer wall (such as facing brick walls), you can apply transparent waterproof paint twice. But if there are cracks and gaps, fill them with mortar first. (B) If black does not affect the appearance, apply waterproof paint once on the outside. (C) First roughen the flat surface (if it is a brick or stone wall, the embedded lines must be chiseled off). Wet it with water. Apply 1...2 cement slurry one inch thick. Mix 4% waterproofing slurry.</p>
<p>(3) Floor:</p>
<p>Cement Floor—Mix 2% waterproofing slurry into the sand-lime mixture to prevent moisture. If the ground is loose, apply Bodijin three times to make it hard and durable.</p>
<p>Mosaic and Other Tile Floors—(A) Mix 2% waterproofing slurry into the cement slurry to prevent moisture from entering. (B) First apply waterproof paint twice or paper-reinforced paint once on the ground. Then use the normal method to lay mosaic or tiles.</p>
<p>(4) Underground Pits, Tunnels, etc.:</p>
<p>New Underground Pit—Use sufficient steel bones and a suitable "drainage" layout. During construction, dig three or four deep pools or ditches to extract the accumulated underground water at any time (water extraction can only be stopped after the underground pit sand-lime mixture is slightly dry). Mix 4% waterproofing slurry into the steel bone cement.</p>
<p>Leaking Underground Pit—(Method A) If water vigorously enters from the wall, first dig out the mud outside the underground pit to reduce the pressure, and extract the accumulated water at any time. (If the inner wall is just printed with water, this can be omitted) Fill the leaking holes with cement mixed with Special Quick Essence (Special Quick Essence can make the cement harden in more than ten seconds). Then roughen the inside of the wall. 1...2 cement slurry half an inch thick. Mix 4% Quick-drying Essence to prevent water from rushing in. The next day, apply 1...2 cement slurry eight minutes thick mixed with 4% waterproofing slurry. After drying, return the excavated soil to its original place.</p>
<p>(Method B) Dig out the soil outside the underground pit. After the underground pit is dry, apply waterproof paint twice on the outside of the wall. After two or three days, return the soil to its original place.</p>
<p>(5) Water Towers, Swimming Pools, etc.—Refer to the underground pit waterproofing method</p>
<p>According to Mr. Zheng Ruyi, the founder of Yale Manufacturing Factory. Has more than ten years of research on house waterproofing methods and material manufacturing. The factory sells all the materials mentioned in the article. The office is located in the Continental Commercial Building</p>

<h3 id="e276">Overview of the Chinese Institute of Engineers <a href="#e276" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c276" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">276</a></h3>
<p>(A) History</p>
<p>In the first year of the Republic of China, Mr. Zhan Tianyou, a pioneer in the engineering field, was then the general manager of the Guangdong-Hankou Railway and gathered comrades in Guangzhou to establish the Chinese Institute of Engineers. Mr. Zhan served as the president. At the same time, Yan Deqing, Tu Weiceng, and others established the Engineering Society in Shanghai, with Mr. Yan serving as the president. Xu Wenwei and others also founded the Railway Colleagues Qiji Society, with Mr. Xu serving as the president. From then on, people in the engineering field became interested and realized the need for organizations. At the same time, there were as many as three associations. Although their names and organizations were slightly different, their purpose was nothing more than to seek the development of engineering academics, the concentration of talents, and to serve the country and society with a spirit of mutual assistance. However, there were still few engineering scholars at that time. The number of members in the three associations was roughly equal, about sixty or seventy people. They were able to hold meetings on schedule, discuss technology, print newsletters, and promote knowledge to awaken the Chinese people's awareness of engineering technology and to know the need for construction. In the second year of the Republic of China, it happened that both Zhan and Yan were in Hankou to build the Guangdong-Hankou-Sichuan Railway. More and more engineering scholars came to gather. They proposed that in order to develop the association's affairs, they should further cooperate. The three associations stood side by side, with different routes but the same goal. It was better to merge into one, so that like-minded people would be more united. Therefore, it was decided to merge the three associations and name it the Chinese Institute of Engineers. Mr. Zhan was elected as the president and Mr. Yan as the vice president. The members were divided into three categories according to civil engineering, mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, mining and metallurgy, military engineering, applied chemistry, shipbuilding and other categories: full members, members, and associate members. From then on, the association's affairs became increasingly developed. The government was in the north at that time, so the association's headquarters was moved to Beiping. Under the promotion of Mr. Zhan, all members tried their best to donate and build a suitable clubhouse on a wide foundation purchased in Baozi Street in the western city. Newsletters were published on schedule, annual meetings were held every year, and monthly meetings were held every month. Many books were published over the years, which were still popular in the world. Mr. Zhan also donated money to set up awards every year to solicit papers. By the end of the 19th year of the Republic of China, there were a total of 500 full members, members, and associate members. Many of them served in government industries and transportation agencies, as well as education, industry, and commerce, and were able to win good reviews.</p>
<p>The Chinese Institute of Engineers was founded in the Republic of China in the sixth year by more than 20 engineers who studied in the United States. The association's headquarters was located in New York, USA. In the seventh year, it held a joint annual meeting with the China Science Society. Since then, the association's affairs have developed, moving towards the path of engineering industry and engineering academics, with annual progress. All kinds of activities are limited to the United States. By the eleventh year of the Republic of China, more and more members returned to China, and the head office was moved back to our country and established in Shanghai. The association's affairs became increasingly prosperous, and its goals were further advanced: one was to test industrial materials, one was to publish newsletters and engineering series, one was to participate in international engineering academic conferences, one was to increase the professional status of engineers and improve the qualifications of members, and one was to contribute practical construction opinions and plans to local and government. In ten years, the reputation has grown day by day, and the number of members has increased day by day. By the 24th year of the Republic of China, there were 2,794 people (including 17 group members), including five major groups: civil engineering, chemical engineering, electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, and mining and metallurgy; branches were set up in Shanghai, Nanjing, Tianjin, Beiping, Hankou, Qingdao, Jinan, Hangzhou, Changsha, Wuzhou, Guangzhou, Nanning, Suzhou, Chongqing, Daye, Taiyuan, Tangshan and other places, together with the United States and Europe, a total of 18 places, which is truly the largest gathering of engineering academics in our country.</p>
<p>In the spring of the 20th year of the Republic of China, the members of the two associations believed that engineering academics in our country were still in their infancy, and that it was urgent to concentrate talents and strive for progress in order to develop. Therefore, Hua Nangui, Hu Shuhua, Ling Hongxun, Xia Guangyu, Xu Peihuang, Wei Yizhi, Wang Shenshan, Tang Zaixian, Xue Cixin and other nine gentlemen proposed a merger and drafted a letter of opinion to solicit the consent of the members of the two associations. In August of the same year, the two sides held a joint annual meeting in the capital and resolved to merge the two associations and rename it the Chinese Institute of Engineers. Wei Yizhi was elected as the first president and Hu Shuhua as the vice president. In the autumn of the 21st year, at the second annual meeting in Tianjin, Yan Deqing was elected as the president and Zhi Bingyuan as the vice president. In the autumn of the 22nd year, the third annual meeting was held in Wuhan, and Sa Fujun was elected as the president and Huang Boqiao as the vice president. In the autumn of the 23rd year, the fourth annual meeting was held in Jinan, and Xu Peihuang was elected as the president and Yun Zhen as the vice president. In August of the 24th year, the fifth annual meeting was held in Nanning, and Yan Deqing was elected as the president and Huang Boqiao as the vice president.</p>
<p>(B) A Glimpse of Work</p>
<p>The purpose of this association is to connect engineering comrades, cooperate in developing the country's engineering industry, and research and promote various engineering academics. All work is carried out in accordance with this purpose. The following is a summary of the business handled by this association in recent years (1) Establishment of the Industrial Materials Testing Institute</p>
<p>(1) Establishment of the Industrial Materials Testing Institute</p>
<p>In recent years, the industry in our country has gradually developed. In view of this, this association began planning to establish an industrial materials testing institute seven years ago to meet the needs. Now the housing for the testing institute has been completed in the central area of Shanghai, and it can serve the society as soon as the machine installation is ready. It is hoped that all sectors of society will make full use of this facility to achieve the effect of cooperation.</p>
<p>(2) Organization of Inspection Groups</p>
<p>In recent years, the provincial governments have entrusted this association to organize inspection groups to investigate and plan for the development of industries and the handling of construction. The Sichuan inspection group last year and the Guangxi inspection group this year have been seen in fact. Both have collected various specialized talents through the association, worked in groups, and compiled detailed reports for the authorities of the two provinces for adoption.</p>
<p>(3) Compilation of Engineering Series</p>
<p>In recent years, Chinese people have paid attention to the study of applied sciences, but there is a great lack of such books. Members of this association are all specialized in their fields, or have studied academic theories, or have rich experience. They should do their best to compile books and contribute to society. Those that have been published include "Reinforced Concrete" by member Zhao Fuling and "Outline of Locomotives" by member Yang Yi. Those that are about to be published include "Maintenance and Repair of Locomotive Boilers" by member Lu Zengqi.</p>
<p>(4) Compilation of Engineering Terminology</p>
<p>Most of the engineering terminology in our country is translated from European and American countries. However, the translations are mixed and extremely inconsistent, which has a great impact on the future development of engineering academics in our country. In view of this, this association compiled and printed various engineering terminologies between the 17th and 18th years of the Republic of China, which was convenient for scholars. The drafts of mechanical and electrical terminologies have been drafted and the first edition has been issued. Later, due to the urgent need of various circles, a committee has been organized by expert members to be responsible for the revision. It is estimated that there are more than 11,000 mechanical terminologies and more than 5,000 electrical terminologies, which are several times more than the first edition. As for other engineering terminologies, they will also be compiled and published one after another.</p>
<p>(5) Award of Honorary Gold Medals</p>
<p>For those who serve the construction industry in Europe and the United States, those who have made special contributions will often be awarded honorary gold medals or medals to encourage experts to spy on happiness for the country and society. The intention is very good. In view of this, this association has formulated measures for awarding honorary gold medals, selecting one person (not limited to members) each year in the engineering field who has made special contributions to award a gold medal to encourage them. This year's gold medal winner is chemical engineering expert Mr. Hou Debang.</p>
<p>(6) Publication of Magazines and Weekly Publications</p>
<p>The world's engineering academics are advancing day by day. At this time when our country is striving for construction, engineering colleagues should exchange knowledge and experience in order to achieve the effect of attacking mistakes. This association publishes two kinds of publications with this purpose. One is the "Engineering Magazine", which is published once every two months, focusing on publishing long articles and theses. The other is the "Engineering Weekly", which is published once a week, focusing on publishing construction news from all over the country.</p>
<p>(7) Introduction of Specialized Talents</p>
<p>The construction industry in our country is expanding day by day, and there are more engineering talents than in the past. However, the voices of those seeking jobs and those seeking talents are often not in communication, which leads to the use of people who are not good at their strengths, or the hiring of people who are not suitable. In view of this, this association has set up a career introduction committee to specialize in finding specialized talents for all sectors of society in order to match people and jobs and meet supply and demand.</p>
<p>(C) Appendix</p>

<h3 id="e277">Outline of the Shanghai Municipal Stadium Project <a href="#e277" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c277" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">277</a></h3>
<p>(I) Origin: The Shanghai Municipal Government, considering that the city's population has reached over three million, yet a large-scale stadium is still lacking, which is insufficient to meet the needs of citizens for physical exercise and leisure entertainment. Moreover, with the establishment of the new city center, various facilities are needed to impress the new citizens and promote the prosperity of the area. Therefore, it planned to build a municipal stadium here, achieving two goals with one move. In early 1934, the architect's office of the Central Area Construction Committee of the municipality began the design. On July 7 of the same year, the Municipal Government submitted a request to the Central Government to issue public bonds of $3.5 million, and designated $1 million for the construction of the municipal stadium. This is a rough overview of the preparation process for the construction of the Shanghai Municipal Stadium.</p>
<p>(II) Location: Since the municipal stadium needs to be of a considerable scale, the area it occupies must be over 1,000 acres. To avoid the acquisition of private land and to conserve funds, a portion of the First Park in the southwest of the Central Area Administrative District was chosen as the construction site for the stadium (marked "5" in the first map). It is bordered by Guohua Road to the east, Songhu Road to the west, Zhengdong Road to the north, and the Qujiang River to the south. To its south are the intersections of Songhu, Xiangyin, Qimei, and Huangxing Avenues, and to its north is the future station where the Songhu Railway will connect to the intersection of Sanmin Road and Songhu Road, making transportation very convenient.</p>
<p>(III) Project Overview: The municipal stadium includes the existing sports field, gymnasium, and swimming pool, and the future addition of tennis courts and baseball fields (second map), covering an area of approximately 300 acres. The key design points are described as follows:</p>
<p>(A) Sports Field: The sports field (marked "　" in the second map) is not only for citizens' daily physical exercise, but also for holding school sports meets, national games, Far Eastern Games, and even world games. Its architectural form and various dimensions are mostly determined by the needs of track and field events, soccer, basketball, tennis, and other competitions. The site does not take the U-shape or circular shape but the chain shape (fourth map) because if it were U-shaped, the main entrance would have to be located at the protruding end, facing the less important Zhengdong Road, which is not appropriate. Also, if it were circular, it would be impossible to set up a 200-meter straight track required for sprinting events. Other design points have also been carefully considered and determined with reference to the layout of famous European and American sports fields.</p>
<p>The site occupied by the field, including the stands, is 175 meters (574 feet) wide and 230 meters (1,082 feet) long. The highest point of the field building is about 20 meters (66 feet) above the ground, and the wall of the stands is about 10 meters (32 feet). The area of the field is about 27,500 square meters (440,400 square feet). The center is a soccer field, volleyball field, and venues for high jump, long jump, discus throw, and Chinese martial arts, surrounded by a circular track approximately 500 meters long. The circular track is bifurcated into straight tracks on the east and west sides, each 200 meters long. Outside the track, there are three tennis courts and three basketball courts on the north and south ends. The circumference of the stands is approximately 760 meters (2,500 feet), and the width is approximately 17 meters (55 feet), accommodating 40,000 seated and 20,000 standing spectators. Its capacity is approximately twice that of the Nanjing Stadium.</p>
<p>To ensure that tens of thousands of spectators can enter and exit quickly and orderly, two types of traffic routes are provided: (A) Circular traffic routes, divided into two lines: one outside the ticket collection points, namely the passageway surrounding the stands (fourth map) and the sidewalks and roadways (9 meters wide) around the field, and the other inside the field, namely the 1.8-meter-wide circular walkway on the stands. (B) Vertical traffic routes, connecting the circular traffic routes with the seats in the stands, namely the entrances and exits between the sections of the stands, leading down to the passageway under the stands and up to the edges of the seats. These entrances are set up in 24 locations, evenly distributed throughout the field. With each entrance allowing 1,200 people to pass through, tens of thousands of spectators can exit completely in a maximum of five minutes. Each entrance is equipped with iron sliding doors so that ticket collectors can easily maintain order when spectators are crowded.</p>
<p>At the center of the east and west long sides of the field, there are magnificent gates for athletes to enter and exit in formation, and vehicles can also pass through directly to the field.</p>
<p>To ensure that spectators' lines of sight can extend from the stands to all parts of the field, the floor of the stands supporting the seats is arranged in a curved shape, with the slope gradually increasing from bottom to top. The construction method is to increase the height of each step by 6 millimeters (1/4 inch) compared to the lower step. The distance between the front and rear seats is 71 centimeters (28 inches), so the area occupied by each seat is 45 centimeters (18 inches) wide and 70 centimeters (28 inches) deep. According to the aforementioned capacity, twenty rows of seats should be set up.</p>
<p>The sports field has ample accommodation, enough to accommodate 2,500 athletes to meet the needs of holding large sports events. There are also magnificent gates and lobbies, lounges, offices, showrooms, information desks, radio broadcasting stations, dining rooms, etc. Its completeness of layout is rarely surpassed even among sports fields worldwide.</p>
<p>There are two special stands, facing each other from east to west, reserved for special guests and journalists. Due to economic considerations, the stands in this field are generally not equipped with wooden chairs, with the exception of the special stand under the flat roof on the west side.</p>
<p>Another special feature is the use of the space under the stands to set up shops, public restrooms, and ticket offices (fourth map). The surrounding passageways not only help to shield these shops from wind and sun, but also provide shelter for spectators in case of heavy rain. According to the current plan, only half of the space under the stands is utilized, and the remaining half is reserved for the future addition of shops, etc.</p>
<p>The sports field uses reinforced concrete as the frame, red bricks for the walls, and artificial stone for the base and coping of the exterior walls. The east and west gates adopt a Chinese style, made of artificial stone. The rest of the structure is quite simple.</p>
<p>The sports field has many flagpoles, which are very important when holding sports events. Floodlights are installed on the field and the front of the field building.</p>
<p>The elevation and cross-section of this field can be seen in Figures 5 and 6.</p>
<p>(B) Gymnasium: This gymnasium (marked "2" in the second map) not only meets the needs of citizens for various indoor sports, but also serves for gatherings, exhibitions, and theatrical performances.</p>
<p>The capacity is 3,500 seats and 1,500 standing positions. Temporary seats can be added around the perimeter of the sports hall when necessary. The sports hall is located in the center of the building, with the floor covered with teak wood. It is approximately 23 meters (63 feet) wide and 40 meters (131 feet) long, and can accommodate three regular basketball courts. For formal competitions, a larger court can be placed in the center, leaving more space on all sides (Eighth Map). The gymnasium building is approximately 46 meters (150 feet) wide and 82 meters (270 feet) long. The stands around the sports hall are supported by sturdy reinforced concrete beams and brick walls. It is approximately 11 meters (36 feet) wide, with thirteen steps, each step 66 centimeters (26 inches) wide and 36 centimeters (14 inches) to 41 centimeters (16 inches) high. The assumed live load during design was 610 kilograms per square meter (125 pounds per square foot), and the total load, including the static load of 120 kilograms per square meter (25 pounds per square foot), was 730 kilograms per square meter.</p>
<p>On both sides of the lobby inside the main entrance, there are staircases for spectators to reach the stands directly. On both sides of the back of the building, there are side doors and narrower staircases for spectators to exit the gymnasium.</p>
<p>The walls on the front of the gymnasium building (Ninth Map) are built with artificial stone, with a modern artistic style incorporating national patterns for decoration. Three arched doors are opened here, which are the main entrance to the gymnasium. The rest of the exterior walls are built with red bricks, and the coping and base are inlaid with artificial stone blocks.</p>
<p>Entering from the main entrance is the entrance hall, with ticket offices on both sides. Further in is the lobby, with men's and women's restrooms and the aforementioned staircases leading to the stands on both sides. Further in is a passage leading directly to the sports hall (basketball court) and the fitness room at the back, and to the offices and reception room on the side. Also, through a door on each side (marked "D" in the Eighth Map), you can reach the men's and women's changing rooms, shower rooms, etc., from which you can access the sports hall, fitness room, and sports equipment storage room. On both sides of the fitness room are the kitchen and boiler room, as well as the entrance halls and staircases of the aforementioned side doors.</p>
<p>The front and back walls of the building, above the platform, have a rounded shape at the top, with the highest point being 20 meters (66 feet) high, and the outer walls on both sides being approximately 12 meters (39 feet 6 inches) high. The roof frames are arranged front to back, each spaced 6 meters 7 centimeters (22 feet) apart, and are three-hinged steel arched frames (Tenth Map). The span (i.e., the distance between the hinge points at both ends) is 42 meters 7 centimeters (140 feet), the rise (i.e., the vertical distance between the center hinge point and the hinge points at both ends) is 19 and a half meters (64 feet), and the radius of the curve of the upper chord is 30 meters (99 feet). The height of the side vertical rods, starting from the hinge points at both ends, is approximately 12 and a half meters (41 feet).</p>
<p>The lighting in the sports hall and fitness room is high-angle, to avoid the problem of athletes feeling dizzy. Therefore, ten fixed casement windows are set on the dome, sixteen octagonal small windows are opened on both sides of the outer walls above the stands, and five rectangular windows are set on the front and back walls above the platform. The latter two types of windows can be opened to allow air circulation. As for electric lights, they are installed under the steel roof frame.</p>
<p>The heating equipment inside the gymnasium building adopts a low-pressure system, and the water condensed from the hot air is returned to the boiler by an automatic pump. The sports hall and fitness room use motorized fans to distribute warm air, and other parts directly utilize the radiation of heat for heating.</p>
<p>(C) Swimming Pool: The purpose of setting up this swimming pool (marked "　" in the second map) is to provide citizens with water sports and to hold swimming competitions. The pool is open-air, surrounded by stands with a capacity of 5,000 seats. Under the stands, there are changing rooms, shower rooms, lounges, shops, public restrooms, boiler rooms, water filtration machine rooms, etc. On the north side of the stands is a magnificent main entrance, inside which there are offices, lounges, halls, ticket offices, etc. Along the east, west, and south sides under the stands, corridors and passageways are built to meet the needs of spectators for shelter from rain (Twelfth Map). Regarding the dimensions of the swimming pool, according to the American college swimming competition regulations, the pool surface should be at least 18 meters (60 feet) long and 6 meters (20 feet) wide. The depth of the pool should be at least 9 decimeters (3 feet) at the shallower end, and at least 1.5 meters (5 feet) at the deeper end. The dimensions of this pool, after consultation with the city's sports officials, are planned to be 50 meters long and 20 meters wide. The bottom of the pool is shaped like a spoon in the direction of the long side, gradually deepening from about 1.1 meters (3 and a half feet) at one end to 1.7 meters (5 and a half feet) in the center, and then steeply dropping to a depth of 3.5 meters (11 and a half feet) from the center to 5 meters (16 feet) from the other end. (This depth is used by the Far Eastern Games).</p>
<p>The pool body is constructed of reinforced concrete and waterproof materials, sufficient to withstand the "water pressure" when the pool is full and the "earth pressure" when the pool is empty. 725 piles are driven into the pool bottom as a base. The bottom and edges of the pool are lined with white mosaic, and the four walls are lined with white ceramic tiles.</p>
<p>The capacity of this pool is approximately 2,200 cubic meters (600,000 gallons). If this huge amount of water is changed frequently, the cost will inevitably be high, and each change will take ten hours, which is also very inconvenient. Therefore, water filtration equipment is installed to turn turbid water coming out of the pool back into clean water, and then return it to the pool for continuous circulation. Each cycle consists of five stages: (1) disinfection, (2) filtration, (3) entry into the pool, (4) circulation, (5) exit from the pool. This filtration work can continue non-stop during the swimming season. Each time it is disinfected and filtered, the water quality becomes cleaner.</p>
<p>The pool's lighting equipment is the latest type, with high-intensity light bulbs placed inside the pool walls under the water surface, so that the light and water color blend together to form a whole "light source," which is very pleasing to the eye when viewed at night. Conversely, if the light is shone down into the pool, the outside of the pool will be very bright due to the reflection of the water surface, but it will only dazzle the swimmers, and the inside of the water will be dark, which may cause difficulties in rescue in the event of an accident. Therefore, the method of placing the lights in the pool below the water surface has the advantages of facilitating both swimming and rescue, and it is particularly necessary to adopt it at a time when summer night swimming is becoming a trend. The design of this pool and its auxiliary buildings is based on practicality, and attention has also been paid to aesthetics. The walls of the main gate are made of artificial stone blocks, with carvings added to show national cultural colors (Thirteenth Map). The rest of the walls are built with red bricks, with artificial stone as the base and coping to save costs. From the perspective of the entire pool building, all architectural forms are adapted to the sports field and gymnasium.</p>
<p>Swimming pools in Europe and the United States often have small pools attached, with a depth of less than 1.2 meters, specifically for children to swim in. Due to budget limitations, this pool has not been able to take this facility into account, which is a pity.</p>
<p>(D) Tennis Courts and Baseball Fields: In the central and northwestern corners of the sports field, it is planned to build tennis courts (with three courts and stands with 4,000 seats, etc.) and a baseball field (with stands with 4,000 seats) (marked "4" and "5" in the second map), which will be built in the future and are not within the scope of this project.</p>
<p>(IV) Construction: The architectural drawings of the sports field, gymnasium, and swimming pool were designed and completed under the direction of Mr. Dong Dayou, architect of the Central Area Construction Committee, and Assistant Architect Mr. Wang Huabin, and after being approved by the Municipal Government, the Bureau of Public Works invited bids in July 1934. Among the eleven bidders, Chen Tai won the bid with the lowest bid price. Construction started in August, and the foundation laying ceremony was held on October 1, with completion scheduled for May 1935.</p>
<p>(V) Concluding Remarks: The design of this project is not lacking in novel points, such as the reinforced concrete roof frame, the layout of traffic routes, the dormitory layout, the facilities under the stands such as shops, and the interior and exterior decoration, all of which can be used as a reference for those designing sports fields in other parts of the country. The fact that the project, with its large scale, high capacity, and complete layout, can be completed with a budget of around one million yuan shows the painstaking efforts of the designer!</p>

<h3 id="e279">An Overview of the Establishment of the Shanghai Municipal Hospital <a href="#e279" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c279" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">279</a></h3>
<p>The goal of public health administration is to prevent diseases as the principle, and to eliminate diseases as the practice; therefore, the general practice of medical administration is that for every thousand people, at least two common disease beds should be prepared, because preventive medicine and treatment medicine should be used together and cannot be neglected. Shanghai has a population of over three million. Looking around the city, although there are many well-run hospitals, it is impossible for ordinary citizens to obtain appropriate medical treatment at a low price. Mayor Wu was concerned about the majority of citizens, thinking about their well-being, and was also saddened by the suffering of the victims of the war, who were plagued by poverty and disease. The Municipal Hospital was particularly needed. Therefore, despite the severe financial constraints and the pressure of other tasks, he resolutely made the establishment of the Municipal Hospital one of the important undertakings for the revitalization of the urban area. He allocated 100 acres of land in the city center and raised 400,000 yuan to build two parts: one is the Municipal Hospital with 200 beds, dedicated to treatment, and the other is the Hygienic Testing Institute for inspection and manufacturing, which also takes into account prevention. He also established the Shanghai Municipal Hospital Preparatory Committee, recruiting experts to work together on this matter. Just as Mr. Hu Wenhu returned to China from overseas and came to Shanghai to visit municipal construction, he realized the importance of medicine and generously donated 110,000 yuan for the equipment of the Hygienic Testing Institute. As a result, the Municipal Hospital, which had been called for for eight years, was completed by Mayor Wu, and Mr. Hu's generosity in donating private funds to help accomplish this matter, his compassionate heart, will be forever remembered by all at home and abroad. This is a brief account of the process of establishing the hospital for future reference. The construction plan will be described in another article and will not be repeated here.</p>

<h3 id="e281">Hopes for the National Building Materials Exhibition <a href="#e281" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c281" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">281</a></h3>
<p>— Ying Dai</p>
<p>We know that building materials exhibitions are often held in various European and American countries. The purpose of holding building materials exhibitions is, on the one hand, to promote the progress of building materials, and on the other hand, to promote domestic building materials. If the scale is larger, it can be expanded to the discussion of building projects, which has a great significance that cannot be ignored!</p>
<p>In the era of the 20th century, China's building materials are too backward. In recent years, several building materials exhibitions have been held in the city of Shanghai. However, the result of these exhibitions is that there are very few visitors, far less lively than art exhibitions and photography exhibitions. From this point, we can see that the Chinese people's concept of building materials is very weak.</p>
<p>In fact, the so-called building materials should not be ignored, especially in the current economic downturn, the economic crisis in China is becoming more and more serious due to the increasing trade deficit year by year. It is very sad to say that most of China's building materials rely on foreign goods. The number of building materials that have to be imported every year is also very alarming. However, most Chinese people do not pay attention to the construction industry, and they often neglect this leakage.</p>
<p>The purpose of the Real Estate Materials and Building Exhibition held by the Engineers Association this time is nothing more than to make the Chinese people pay attention to what extent domestic building materials have progressed, and which building materials our domestic products are already very good, and do not need to rely on the supply of foreign merchants; and this is also a rare opportunity, which happens to coincide with the opening of the National Games. Undoubtedly, there will be more visitors to this exhibition than to the previous exhibitions, and the result may arouse considerable attention to building materials among the Chinese people.</p>
<p>On the part of the building materials merchants themselves, this exhibition can enable everyone to pay attention to how their products are doing, what are their achievements, and what are their shortcomings? They can make further research, improve with a will, and make domestic building materials cheap and good, enough to seize the market of foreign goods. Shanghai Municipal Administrative District Bird's-eye View Designed by Architect Dong Dayou, to avoid a huge outflow of money from China. At the same time, visitors should enthusiastically promote domestic building materials, and in the future, when applying these materials, they should never use foreign goods if there are domestic products. If this can be done, the future of domestic building materials will have unlimited development. It can be seen that this exhibition has great significance!</p>
<p>Our smallest hope is to seek that this exhibition can arouse social attention to building materials, and can promote the great progress of domestic building materials!</p>

But when we think back to the arduous and extraordinary spirit of the martyrs, we should encourage each other. It is important for us to encourage without forgetting to congratulate during the celebration. This is the important meaning of our commemoration today. Secondly, he said that today, in the midst of congratulating and encouraging each other, we have infinite hope for the healthy future of our nation. To achieve this goal, we must first pay attention to the organization of the nation. The tutelage work indicated to us by Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings is mostly related to the organization of the nation, such as the census and the land survey. Therefore, what we need in this difficult environment is a healthy nation. We should organize the nation in accordance with Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings, and we should make this organization a complete success so as to achieve the goal of health. Only in this way can we be worthy of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, and we can be worthy of the martyrs above and the people below. At 9:30 a.m., the speech was over, the music was played, and the ceremony was completed. The whole group took a group photo in front of the National Government Auditorium before dispersing.

<p>Participating Representatives</p>
<p>The representatives from all circles participating in the Double Tenth National Day Commemoration Meeting included the presidium: Xing Wan from the Municipal Party Department, Chen Kecheng from the Municipal Government, Pan Xusheng from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Li Mengnan from the Municipal General Labor Union, Yu Zhenhui from the Municipal Farmers' Association, Lin Kecong from the Municipal Women's Association, Zhang Lichun from the Municipal Education Association, and Jiang Huaishu from the Defense Committee.

<p>Venue Arrangement</p>
<p>The venue was in the lecture hall of the Municipal Public Education Center. The national flag and the portrait of the Premier were hung on the rostrum. Small national paper flags were hung crisscrossed in the venue, and there were slogans posted. The national flags were hung high at the entrance, with a bamboo cloth banner in the middle, which read "Shanghai All Circles Representatives Double Tenth National Day 24th Anniversary Commemoration Meeting." The meeting was policed by marshals and police officers from the Public Security Bureau to maintain order, and Boy Scouts were sent to take care of the entrance.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report</p>
<p>At 10 a.m., representatives from all circles gathered at the meeting hall. Firecrackers were set off first, and the national flag was raised. After the ceremony began, Chairman Xing Wan delivered the opening speech, saying, "Fellow compatriots, fellow comrades, today is the 24th anniversary of the Double Tenth National Day. The Double Tenth National Day is the result of many martyrs exchanging their heads and blood. During the Qing Dynasty, China was in a critical state day by day due to the court's oppression of foreign races and the corruption of political measures. Our Party's Premier Sun knew that there was no way to save the country without overthrowing the Qing government, so he used his innate talent and gathered patriots to establish our Party to carry out the revolution and strive for the survival and independence of our Chinese nation. At that time, the Qing Dynasty court severely oppressed the revolutionary forces. Although the revolutionary volunteers experienced ten failures, they still adhered to the spirit of perseverance to overthrow the Qing Dynasty court. Since the Guangzhou Uprising on March 29th of the Xinhai year, revolutionary ideas have spread throughout the country, and the revolutionary forces have become increasingly strong. Our Party comrades then turned to the Yangtze River basin to carry out activities, gathering like-minded people, mobilizing the New Army, and waiting for an opportunity to act. When the Qing government had a proposal to nationalize the railways, the people rose up to resist, but the Qing court unreasonably used high pressure and issued an edict to kill without mercy. As a result, the people became increasingly angry. Peng Zefan, Pan Fuhui, Yang Hongsheng, and other martyrs in the Wuchang New Army believed that the time had come and urgently wanted to launch an uprising, so they sent people to invite Huang Keqiang and others to Hubei to plan together. Later, the New Army launched an uprising, and the Qing soldiers lost control and the order was in chaos. In a few days, the revolutionary army completely occupied the three towns of Wuhan and publicly elected Li Yuanhong as governor. Then, Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Guangdong, Guizhou, Yunnan and other provinces responded to independence one after another. In less than a month, the revolutionary army had recovered more than ten provinces, and thus overthrew the Qing Dynasty and established the Republic of China. However, after actual investigation, the results of this revolution were not thorough. One was because the Party organization was not sound, the second was because comrades ignored Premier Sun's doctrine and strategies and failed to follow them, and the third was because the publicity, organization, and training of the masses were not deeply emphasized, resulting in the loss of the support of the people. After the establishment of the Republic of China, it caused the warlords to harm the country and the people, the imperialists to continue to invade and oppress, and the Red Bandits to disturb the nation. Therefore, after the Xinhai Revolution, the lessons learned from the revolution were: (1) Only by following the Three Principles of the People can we build the avenue of the Republic of China; (2) Only by supporting our Party can we seek the long-term stability and security of the Republic of China; (3) We must thoroughly eliminate the reactionary forces to ensure true peace and unity; (4) Revolutionary forces will always defeat reactionary forces. Therefore, future revolutionary efforts must establish a new Republic of China under the leadership of a revolutionary leader."</p>
<p>Comforting the Soldiers</p>
<p>After Chairman Xing Wan's report, Lin Ke listened to the report on the conference proposal, saying, "Chairman Chiang, in view of the current domestic instability due to the disturbance of the Communist bandits, led the three armies deep into the bandit dens to severely suppress them. This meeting intends to send a telegram to the soldiers at the front to comfort them." All representatives unanimously agreed and resolved, "Chairman Chiang led the soldiers to suppress the Red Bandits with great effort and merit. The meeting should send a telegram to the front to express its condolences." Then, Li Mengnan, the representative of the Municipal General Labor Union, gave a speech. In addition to elaborating on the significance of the National Day, he advised all circles to solve the disaster in the spirit of mutual support in the face of the current severe flood situation. Representatives from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Pan Xusheng, etc., also delivered speeches one after another. The length of the speeches has been omitted.</p>
<p>Meeting Slogans</p>
<p>Finally, call out the slogans, 1. National Day Commemoration is the commemoration of our Party's Xinhai Revolution to overthrow the Qing Dynasty and establish the Republic of China. 2. October 10th is the commemoration day of the revival and glory of the Chinese nation. 3. Commemorate the National Day, do not forget the difficulties of Premier Sun and the martyrs in creating the Republic of China. 4. Commemorate the National Day, we must produce and build, and enrich national strength. 5. Commemorate the National Day, we must eliminate the Red Bandits and stabilize society. 6. Support the government and implement construction work. 7. Unite sincerely to ensure peaceful unification. 8. Long live the Chinese Kuomintang. 9. Long live the Three Principles of the People. 10. Long live the Republic of China.</p>

<h3 id="e294">League of Nations Assembly Passes Key Sanctions Against Italy, Over Fifty Nations Accept Administrative Council Report, Separate Twenty-Four Nation Committee Formed to Study Details, Only Austria and Hungary Abstain During Assembly Vote <a href="#e294" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c294" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">294</a></h3>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Assembly today passed the report of the Six-Nation Committee condemning Italy as the aggressor in the war against Abyssinia. More than fifty nations supported the report, with only Austria and Hungary abstaining. French Prime Minister Laval declared to the Assembly that France was prepared to fulfill all its obligations under the League of Nations Covenant. Swiss representative Motta also made a similar declaration, stating that Switzerland was prepared to faithfully participate in the League of Nations economic sanctions. (National Telegram, 10th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Assembly reconvened this morning at 10:45 a.m. After the Italian chief delegate Aloisi's impassioned and lengthy defense of Italy's position, Chairman Benes announced that the Administrative Council's report condemning Italy had been endorsed by the majority, except for Austria and Hungary, which expressed dissent. The delegates present today remained silent on the League of Nations' final condemnation of Italy as a violator of the Covenant. The most noteworthy statement in Aloisi's speech was that the League of Nations had delayed dealing with the Sino-Japanese dispute for as long as seventeen months and the Chaco dispute for as long as two years. The League of Nations did not resort to sanctions in the Sino-Japanese dispute or the Bolivia-Paraguay dispute. The Italian people do not understand why the League of Nations is treating Italy differently. Italy's actions are in accordance with the League of Nations Covenant and international obligations. Italy has the right to exercise self-defense, and Abyssinia has proven itself unfit to remain in the League of Nations, he stated. After Aloisi's address, Benes rose and said, "If no other representative wishes to speak, then I will take silence as consent to the Administrative Council's resolution." There was silence for several seconds. The chairman then solemnly announced, "The judgment has been passed." A general discussion then followed, with French Prime Minister Laval and British Minister without Portfolio Eden speaking in succession. French Prime Minister Laval delivered a brief speech, declaring that France was willing to fulfill its obligations. "We cannot violate the Covenant, nor can we allow it to be weakened. However, we also believe that our implementation of the Covenant's laws is aimed at seeking a moderate solution," he said.</p>
<p>British Minister without Portfolio Eden declared, "Swift action must be taken now. The British government will fully carry out its responsibilities. We undertake our task with the deepest regret." Swiss representative Motta announced that Switzerland did not wish to deviate from its solidarity with the other nations of the League of Nations and raised reservations against military sanctions.</p>
<p>Then, Haitian representative General Nemours unexpectedly rose and declared that the Black Republic of Haiti was prepared to fully fulfill its responsibilities. Mexican representative Gómez followed, declaring that Mexico would not evade its obligations. Finally, Soviet Russian representative Potemkin rose and said that Soviet Russia was willing to fulfill its responsibilities fully. "When a member violates Article 12 of the Covenant and uses force without cause, it is the responsibility of the members to respond with united action," he said.</p>
<p>The Assembly then adjourned until 4:30 p.m. to continue the general discussion. It is expected that the Albanian representative will raise reservations at that time. (Reuters, 10th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Assembly reconvened this morning at 10:45 a.m. The atmosphere was very serious. The meeting adjourned at 12:55 p.m. First, the Italian chief delegate Aloisi rose to speak, expounding on his country's position. Representatives from Great Britain, France, Soviet Russia, Haiti, and Mexico then responded, unanimously advocating for the implementation of the Covenant. Swiss representative Motta alone raised reservations, stating that Switzerland maintained a loyal attitude toward the League of Nations, but as a permanently neutral country, its position was unique. Aloisi's speech was divided into four sections. The first section criticized the League of Nations' procedure toward Italy, saying that the Administrative Council did not allow Italy to fully present its views before determining that it had violated the Covenant. However, in the past, the Administrative Council had taken a longer time on similar cases, especially the Sino-Japanese dispute, where it did not submit a report in accordance with Article 15 of the Covenant until ten months after the parties had come into conflict. In the case of the Chaco dispute, it was delayed for as long as two years. "This time, a swift procedure was adopted for the Italo-Abyssinian dispute, suddenly submitting the case to the Assembly for handling. Why?" The second section recounted the relationship between Italy and the League of Nations, stating that Italy was a civilized great power that had cooperated with the League of Nations from its inception. Its faithful attitude had been demonstrated in the Saar dispute and the disarmament issue. Conversely, Abyssinia had failed to fulfill all the obligations required of a member state. This could be seen in the Five-Nation Committee's proposal to limit Abyssinia's sovereignty. The third section stated that the safety of Italy's colonies in East Africa was threatened, but the League of Nations refused to provide assistance. Italy had no choice but to rely on its own strength to protect them. The fourth section was based on legal principles, stating that in accordance with Article 22 of the Covenant, advanced countries could assist backward countries to promote their civilization and develop their economies. It was also stated that Italy's actions in Abyssinia did not conflict with the obligations stipulated in the Kellogg-Briand Pact. Great Britain had also raised reservations regarding this pact, namely that it did not apply to matters affecting the vital interests and security of the British Empire within certain regions. In short, after the Sino-Japanese dispute and the Chaco dispute occurred, the League of Nations Covenant had already been violated. Why was there no proposal to impose sanctions at that time? Italy has the right to ask the League of Nations this question. Aloisi concluded by saying that the course of history could not be stopped. The League of Nations' responsibility lies in eliminating the causes of international disputes. For now, the first priority is to abandon biased policies, and the second is to ensure that the principles of evolution and conservation can be reconciled. "Italy is a great laboring nation and demands justice from the League of Nations," he said. After Italian representative Aloisi finished his address, French Prime Minister Laval immediately followed with a brief declaration, stating that France still regarded the League of Nations Covenant as its guide. "France will continue to carry out mediation work with the League of Nations and still expresses faith in the League of Nations." British Minister without Portfolio Eden then argued that the League of Nations should take prompt action to implement the principles enshrined in the Covenant. He said, "The League of Nations has two responsibilities: one is to resolve international disputes fairly to prevent war, and the other is to stop war once it has begun. The strength of the League of Nations depends on its ability to stop the Italo-Abyssinian War. Great Britain remains prepared to participate in any solution based on the Covenant." At this point, Swiss representative Motta stated that his country would participate in the work of the sanctions adjustment committee, but only to the extent that it did not affect its neutral status, and that it hoped the League of Nations would continue its efforts to mediate. Soviet Russian representative Potemkin, who is also the country's ambassador to France, stated that his country was prepared to fulfill its obligations under the Covenant to stop the Italo-Abyssinian War. Finally, representatives from Haiti and Mexico, Nemours and Gómez, spoke in moving terms, advocating for collective action to stop the war. At that point, the meeting adjourned until 4:30 p.m. (Havas, 10th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Assembly convened yesterday in an atmosphere of tension to consider the issue of sanctions against Italy. The members had differing views. After Chairman Benes spoke to explain the purpose of calling the meeting, the representatives of Austria and Hungary announced that their governments refused to participate in any sanctions, causing an uproar throughout the chamber. Austrian representative Pflügl rose and stated that the Austrian government wished to reiterate its loyalty and adherence to the principles of the League of Nations, but its position was such that it could not endorse the resolutions of the other members of the Administrative Council. Italy had made great efforts to assist Austria's independence in difficult circumstances, and Austria therefore felt deep sympathy for the Italians. Austria could not fail to reciprocate this friendship, he said. Hungarian representative de Velics then stated that Hungary could not endorse a resolution to impose sanctions on a country that had always maintained friendly relations with the Hungarian people. Hungary was in an unfortunate position with regard to economic sanctions, as the cessation of all exports to Italy would cause economic turmoil and a serious financial panic.</p>
<p>The delegates at the Assembly looked at each other in astonishment at this development. No other representative rose to speak, and the chairman announced that the meeting would be adjourned until today, at which time the Italian chief delegate Aloisi and others would present their views on the Administrative Council's resolution.</p>
<p>A large number of people attended yesterday's meeting, and there was not a single empty seat in the gallery. Chairman Benes stated that the Assembly had originally been scheduled to adjourn a week earlier, but the reason for the decision to extend the session was that (1) the development of the war had led to a serious change in the overall situation, and (2) the Administrative Council had reached a point where it needed the cooperation of the Assembly. Benes then recounted the development of the overall situation since the Assembly's previous adjournment and reported that the Administrative Council had passed the Six-Person Committee's resolution that the outbreak of the Abyssinian War was clear evidence that Italy had disregarded the League of Nations Covenant and resorted to force. He then read the letter from Administrative Council Chairman Quiñones de León, which cited the Assembly's resolution of October 4, 1921, stating that, in accordance with the clear terms of the Covenant, all members were now required to fulfill the obligations stipulated in Article 16. Anyone who disregarded this task could not avoid violating treaty obligations. For this reason, the Assembly formally resolved to include the matter on the agenda so that the dispute could be discussed immediately. To eliminate misunderstandings, the Chairman stated that the Presidium had decided that</p>
<p>(1) The Administrative Council should continue to handle the matter,</p>
<p>(2) The Assembly should not replace the Administrative Council,</p>
<p>(3) The Assembly representatives may express their opinions on the matter,</p>
<p>(4) The Administrative Council should participate in the work of the special committee (i.e., the one handling sanctions) in accordance with the Assembly's recommendations. Benes then asked any representatives who wished to oppose the Administrative Council's resolution or who did not wish to participate in the plan contained in the resolution to explain the reasons for their difficult situation. Anyone who did not speak would be deemed to have approved and tacitly consented to the Administrative Council's resolution.</p>
<p>After the Chairman finished speaking, the representatives of Austria and Hungary then successively expressed their governments' dissent to the sanctions. (Reuters, 10th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Presidium of the Assembly has appointed Argentina, Australia, Chile, Denmark, Ecuador, France, Great Britain, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Spain, Turkey, Soviet Russia, Yugoslavia, Venezuela, Persia, South Africa, Austria, Belgium, Greece, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Sweden, and Czechoslovakia to form a committee to draft the details of the sanctions. (National Telegram, 9th)</p>
<p>(London) The Daily Telegraph reports that French and British experts have reached an agreement in Geneva on sanctions measures and will submit their views to the League of Nations Sanctions Adjustment Committee today. The content is divided into four items: (1) Absolutely prevent countries from lending money to Italy, (2) Adopt restrictive measures and import quotas for goods imported from Italy, (3) Restrict the export of goods necessary for military industry to Italy, (4) Cancel the ban on arms shipments to Abyssinia. (Havas, 10th)</p>
<p>(Rome) A reporter inquired with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman about the news that Austria and Hungary had refused to participate in sanctions against Italy. The response was, "The road is still open." However, fair-minded observers here believe that the sanctions plan passed by fifty countries on the fourth of this month will soon force Prime Minister Mussolini to seek peace. This observation is based on two reasons: (1) The League of Nations' plan to jointly boycott Italian goods will cut off Italy's supply of foreign exchange, making it impossible for it to purchase goods from Germany, Austria, and Hungary. (2) It would be easy for League of Nations member states to cut off the supply of key raw materials for military equipment, such as fuel oil and nickel. Although representatives of various countries in Geneva do not hold out hope that Germany will participate in the sanctions, they have stated that the declarations of Austria and Hungary are not as important as they are being portrayed. In view of the League of Nations' sanctions being imminent, it is noteworthy that an Italian spokesperson reiterated Italy's willingness to negotiate peace. (National Telegram, 9th)</p>
<p>The Hague The Dutch Parliament today passed a bill authorizing the government to manage export goods in order to promote peace. The bill is similar to the Neutrality Act passed by the U.S. Congress. The government now has the power to order a ban on arms shipments to belligerent countries. However, one aspect is more thorough than the U.S. plan: it not only prohibits the export of armaments but also prohibits raw materials for armaments. (National Telegram, 9th)</p>

<p>(London) Parliament will convene a week earlier, on the 22nd of this month, rather than the 29th. This was the result of yesterday's weekly cabinet meeting. The early opening of Parliament has revived hopes for an early general election. Well-informed sources say that a general election is expected to be held soon, around mid-December. The resolution of the general election issue will depend on the amount of business after Parliament opens this time. Approximately several bills will be shelved, as is customary before Parliament is dissolved. Therefore, the relevant departments are actively considering this issue. The government may shelve all unfinished business in Parliament and announce a general election after Parliament discusses international affairs in order to obtain a new mandate to deal with any developments that may arise in the international situation.

<p>(Rome) According to well-informed sources, Italy will continue its offensive as soon as it has consolidated its defenses in the positions it has captured in East Africa. The current lull in fighting does not mean a ceasefire for negotiations. However, Italy still hopes to negotiate with Great Britain and France. (Reuters, 10th)</p>
<p>(Rome) Previous reports that the key northern Abyssinian city of Axum had been captured by Italian forces have not been confirmed by semi-official sources here, but they say that the fall of the city is imminent. At the same time, rumors that Abyssinian troops had retaken the city of Adwa have been denied here. Italian military and diplomatic actions are now proceeding in tandem. On the one hand, they are intensifying military operations to force the League of Nations to recognize Italy's rights in Abyssinia. On the other hand, they are still prepared to negotiate a solution with Great Britain and France on the basis of the 1906 Tripartite Treaty. Regarding the bombing of the Abyssinian capital by Italian planes, although the various foreign legations there are concerned about it, it is said that the Italian planes will take all possible measures at the time, such as using flares, to avoid harming the legations.

<p>(London) According to military experts here, Italian forces will probably not be able to completely conquer Abyssinian territory before the start of the rainy season in East Africa next year. According to the military plan set by Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, it will take at least eighteen months to completely occupy Abyssinia. However, if the rainy season is encountered in the middle, the fighting will inevitably stop, and if countries implement economic sanctions, it will cause serious obstacles for Mussolini. Therefore, it is also possible that Mussolini will be forced to stop the war before completing his mission. (Havas, 9th)</p>

<p>(Paris) According to news here today, the Italian expedition to East Africa has resulted in 12,000 deaths from illness to date. According to French reports, 10,000 Italian soldiers suffering from tropical diseases have been transported back to Italy via the Suez Canal, and another 2,000 in domestic camps are already infected. There are countless cases of dysentery, malaria, and other diseases in Italian territories. However, if the total number of Italian troops in Africa is estimated at 200,000, the results are still not bad, as these soldiers are all from northern Italy and are not accustomed to the heat. It is said that French experts in Africa believe that Italian troops are likely to suffer from a lack of meat and gradually starve to death. High-ranking Italian generals are also very anxious about this point. It is said that they have told Italian Prime Minister Mussolini that even if the League of Nations imposes very mild sanctions, cutting off the supply of refrigerated meat would be fatal to the Italian army. Current news in London indicates that the first step in British sanctions is to seize refrigerated transport ships, which has attracted much attention. (National Telegram, 9th)</p>

Therefore, the constitutional position of the master of Memel remains unchanged, and the Governor-General of Memel will continue to manage the affairs of Memel without being subject to the Parliament's control.

A solemn and grand opening ceremony was held at the Shanghai Municipal Stadium in the central district of Shanghai, which was newly built at a cost of millions of dollars. Chairman Lin of the National Government attended in person and delivered a speech. President Wang and Chairman Chiang also sent representatives to deliver speeches. Ambassadors, ministers, consuls in Shanghai, and Chinese and foreign dignitaries gathered at the venue. 38 units participated, a new record for the Games. There were over 2,000 athletes. Before the opening ceremony, a celebration ceremony was held to celebrate National Day. After the opening ceremony, 3,000 elementary school students performed Tai Chi exercises, which were extremely magnificent.</p>
<p>According to statistics, about 100,000 spectators attended the Games yesterday, which shows how grand the occasion was. It is a pity that the weather was not good. There was a slight drizzle before the opening ceremony, but this did not dampen the enthusiasm. After the opening ceremony, the weather cleared up again, until it rained again around 4:00 PM, and the rain became heavier and heavier. The track and field competition was stopped because of this. It is hoped that the weather will be good today.</p>
<p>Yesterday's ball games were all preliminary rounds, and the track and field competitions were also preliminary rounds, so there were no significant signs. However, Shanghai has already won 19 points in women's track and field, dominating everything, and there is a great chance of winning the championship. It is a pity that no records were broken. It is hoped that from today onwards, everyone can work harder and new records will emerge one after another.</p>
<h3 id="e307">Solemn and Enthusiastic Venue: Unprecedented Grand Occasion in the City Center <a href="#e307" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c307" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">307</a></h3>
<p>Starting at 8:00 AM yesterday, public buses and trains were packed to the brim, making it difficult for those with less strength to board even after waiting for several hours. The bustling scene was evident. Residents along Jiangwan Road had even less chance to get on the bus. The athletic field was surrounded by heads, numbering over hundreds of thousands. Ticket booths and entrances were exceptionally crowded. At noon, when the audience dispersed for lunch, every restaurant was packed. Even those in remote corners were bustling with customers. Other shops also experienced a hundredfold increase in business, making it an unprecedentedly lively day in the city center.</p>
<p>Enthusiastic Spectators</p>
<p>In the morning, the sky was overcast, with light rain overnight. The sporadic drizzle did not affect the proceedings of the event. Around 7:00 AM, the main avenues in the city center were already filled with vehicles, and tourists walked in groups. The traffic police effectively directed vehicles, maintaining order for pedestrians and vehicles. After 8:00 AM, students from various schools and Boy Scouts gathered, and military music frequently arose from around the venue. Because yesterday was the Double Tenth National Day, all agencies and shops were closed for commemoration, making the crowds even larger. Most attendees wore raincoats and carried rain gear, demonstrating the nation's enthusiasm for sports.</p>
<p>West Rostrum</p>
<p>The West Rostrum, after a day and night of preparation, appeared splendid. At the highest point, the national party flag and the portrait of Sun Yat-sen were hung. The front of the platform was decorated with red and green silk ribbons. Many pots of fresh flowers were arranged in front of the platform, adding vitality. Guest seats were marked with numbers, and guests were guided to their seats by female ushers. Many rectangular soft mats were placed on the benches, likely to prevent the distinguished guests from getting tired after sitting for a long time. These mats were sold at low prices by merchants throughout the venue.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of the Grandstand</p>
<p>Mayor Wu Tiecheng arrived at the venue around 8:00 AM, wearing formal attire, as did senior officials of the municipal government, who were busy taking care of the arrangements. By 9:30 AM, government officials and personnel from various embassies also continued to arrive, giving the West Rostrum a dignified and solemn appearance. At this time, the northern grandstand was already filled with guests. From the two rostrums, one could only see a sea of faces, mostly wearing dark brown clothing, and their number was impossible to estimate. The southern grandstand was mostly occupied by Boy Scouts, forming a yellow expanse. Each team formed a sloping rectangle, which was quite orderly and impressive.</p>
<p>Clear Broadcast</p>
<p>Several loudspeakers were installed on the West Rostrum, one for broadcasting announcements and another for speeches by officials attending the event. The machines were connected to six broadcasting tubes throughout the venue, ensuring that audiences in every part of the grandstand could clearly hear everything. Thirty-eight red markers were planted in the field in front of the platform, to serve as lineup standards for representatives of each team when they took the oath.</p>
<p>Soaring Aircraft</p>
<p>At 9:25 AM, the China Aviation Society dispatched the "Save the Nation" No. 2 aircraft to distribute leaflets. The colorful leaflets fluttered in the air. The two aircraft flew around the field very low, and the pilots and leaflet distributors were clearly visible. Every time the audience saw a handful of leaflets being thrown down, they cheered loudly, creating a lively scene. Around 10:00 AM, they flew back to Longhua Airport. At 11:00 AM, another aircraft from the Eurasia Aviation Corporation flew over, circling the field and distributing leaflets and dropping a flower basket tied with red silk ribbons. Large characters reading "Congratulations on the Success of the 6th National Games" were written on the ribbon, a gift from the Nanjing Daily. At 10:10 AM, three military aircraft from Hangzhou arrived over the venue, flying in formation and distributing leaflets.</p>
<p>Chairman Enters</p>
<p>Chairman Lin departed from Avenue Petain at 8:00 AM yesterday morning, accompanied by Chief Aide Mao Zhongfang. Mayor Wu also added Staff Officer Xu and Municipal Secretary Guo as escorts. At 8:30 AM, he arrived at the Municipal Government to rest. At 9:20 AM, he left the Municipal Government and traveled via Sanmin Road, Guofu Road, Xiangyin Road, and Songhu Road to the entrance of the city center stadium. Chairman Wang and Mayor Wu stepped forward to welcome him with a handshake. After the honor guard and ceremonial guard, he first went to the lounge to rest. At 9:45, he entered the rostrum as chairman and delivered a speech. As Chairman Lin walked into the rostrum, the entire audience stood up. The Chairman, holding his hat in one hand, frequently nodded to the guests and the personnel from various embassies. Only after the Chairman was seated in the center did the audience sit down.</p>

<p>Around 9:00 AM, important figures from the Central National Government, foreign envoys, and important officials of the Games entered one after another and ascended the West Rostrum.

<p>At 10:00 AM, the National Day Commemoration Ceremony was held. The entire audience stood and sang the national anthem. Mayor Wu delivered a speech, stating that today was not only the opening of the Sixth National Games but also a day to commemorate the founding of the nation by remembering revolutionary martyrs and honoring the National Day. He then led the crowd in shouting "Long live the Republic of China," to which the entire venue responded with cheers.</p>
<h3 id="e310">Grand Opening Ceremony: President Wang Shijie Presides <a href="#e310" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c310" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">310</a></h3>
<p>After the National Day Commemoration Ceremony, the grand opening ceremony of the Games commenced. Minister Wang, the Chairman, and Yu Hongjun, the Secretary of the Municipal Government, acted as masters of ceremonies, proceeding with the rituals in order. The athletes paraded around the field, the Games flag was raised, six cannon shots were fired, and white doves were released. Simultaneously, aircraft from the aviation school performed aerial displays and distributed leaflets. Chairman Wang then delivered the opening address, and Mayor Wu, the Director of the Preparatory Committee, delivered a speech. All the athletes, led by Wang Jihuai representing the Shanghai team, then took the oath. After the oath, Honorary President Lin delivered an address, followed by Honorary Vice President Kong, representing Premier Wang, and Zhu Peide, representing Chairman Chiang, who also delivered addresses. Then, the National Games song was sung, and the athletes departed.</p>
<h3 id="e311">Report by Wang Shijie: Adhering to the Belief of Fair Competition, Demonstrating the Ability of Team Cooperation <a href="#e311" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c311" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">311</a></h3>
<p>Chairman Wang Shijie reported, "Today is the first day of the Sixth National Games. The holding of the National Games has two basic purposes: one is that such a grand gathering can arouse the strong attention of the people across the country to sports; and the other is that the skills, courage, and spirit shown by the athletes can provide a good example for the youth of the whole country. Therefore, I would like to extend the following two hopes to all the male and female athletes in this Games: (1) Strictly adhere to the belief of fair competition; (2) Fully demonstrate the ability of team cooperation. The above are my expectations for all the athletes. In addition, I hope that the holding of this Games can enable us to work together towards the following two major goals: first, a strong and healthy nation; second, a united nation. With our goals set, we must also hope that all the agencies in the country that have the responsibility of publicity, especially those engaged in news, film, and other industries, will give sports news ample opportunities to spread, so that a strong and healthy nation and a united nation can quickly become nationwide propaganda. I wish this National Games a success."</p>
<h3 id="e312">Mayor Wu's Welcome Speech: Welcoming All Units to Shanghai, Encouraging Gentlemanly Competition <a href="#e312" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c312" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">312</a></h3>
<p>The Sixth National Games is opening today. As the Director of the Preparatory Committee and the Mayor of Shanghai, I am deeply honored to participate in this grand event and extend my sincere welcome to all of you. You are all promising young people and skilled athletes from all walks of life. This time, you represent your respective units to participate in various competitions of the Games. Some of you have traveled far across the Eastern Ocean, a journey of thousands of miles; others have overcome the barrier of mountains and rivers, taking a month to arrive. You have all shown great courage and come together for this event. This spirit is a symbol of national rejuvenation and fully demonstrates the new vitality of our Republic of China. The Games is honored by your presence.</p>
<p>What I hope from you is that each of you can give full play to your strengths and achieve great success in the various competitions you participate in. What I also hope from you is that the significance of modern sports lies in national defense and production, not in personal vanity. If you show the spirit of gentlemanly competition in the competition, then the result, even in failure, is more honorable than the victory achieved by improper methods. Moreover, the manifestation of sportsmanship should not be limited to the sports field; it should be extended to the nation and society. We should use this principle to restrain ourselves and make it a lifelong guide.</p>
<p>The central and Shanghai municipal governments, in order to ensure the success of the Games, have done their best in terms of preparatory work, providing financial support, and paying close attention to the convenience and comfort of the athletes and spectators. I believe that the Shanghai Stadium is one of the largest and most well-equipped buildings in the Far East, and it is also something that Shanghai can be proud of. I hope that in the future, we will continue to use this excellent venue to plan for the development of sports and the vitality of the nation, and not fail the government's construction efforts.</p>

<p>At 11:30 AM, with the opening of the National Games, all the athletes, led by Secretary-General Shen Siliang, Deputy Secretary-General Ma Chonggan, Shao Rujing, Jiang Xiangze, and a municipal military band, entered from the main gate of the rostrum and circled the field.

In particular, when the Heilongjiang, Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, Rehe, Mongolian, Xikang, Xinjiang, Malayan, and Javanese teams entered, the crowd applauded and cheered enthusiastically. After circling the field, they lined up at the entrance on the east side. The solemn ceremony then began after cannon shots.</p>
<h3 id="e314">All Athletes Take the Oath, Led by Wang Jihuai of Shanghai <a href="#e314" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c314" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">314</a></h3>
<p>The oath was taken under the leadership of Wang Jihuai, representing Shanghai. Representatives from each unit stood in a circle in front of the rostrum. Wang Jihuai, representing everyone, bowed to the rostrum, while all the athletes stood solemnly and raised their hands to read the oath as follows: "We hereby uphold the spirit of physical education proposed by the late Dr. Sun Yat-sen and participate in the competition as amateur athletes. We are willing to strictly abide by all the rules of the Games and obey the decisions of the referees. We pledge."</p>
<h3 id="e315">Chairman Lin Delivers an Address: Promoting Sports, Reviving the Nation <a href="#e315" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c315" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">315</a></h3>
<p>Chairman Lin of the National Government said in his address, "Today is the National Day of the Republic of China, and the Sixth National Games are being held here. If the people want to be physically fit and mentally rejuvenated, they must develop physical and mental health and develop sports. In ancient China, there were systems of spring hunting, summer hunting, autumn hunting, and winter hunting, which were originally designed to develop national sports. In recent centuries, people have become accustomed to being weak in both literary and martial arts, and the national strength has also declined as a result. In the late Qing Dynasty, officials were complacent and neglectful of military affairs, and foreign troubles deepened, to the point that we were ridiculed by countries around the world and called the 'Sick Man of Asia.' The country's position became increasingly worse, which is painful to think about. Since our Party came to power, we have spared no effort in promoting sports. The results of various sports events at previous National Games have made significant progress. Now, seeing the athletes cheering and dancing and joining the event, they will surely create amazing new records, so as to promote national glory. I deeply hope that those who participate in the competition will not be arrogant when they win, and will not be discouraged when they lose. They should discuss each other, learn from each other, and strive to create new records in the next Games. Moreover, national sports should aim at the general development of the masses. The government holds the National Games to promote this. After participating in this event, all athletes must work hard to promote it, so that the national sports of the country can be developed evenly, and hopefully it will become a trend, and people's minds will be revitalized, saving the country and reviving the nation. This is the hope of the Chairman and the mission that all athletes should have. Let us encourage each other."</p>
<h3 id="e316">Premier Wang of the Executive Yuan: The Meaning of the National Games Lies Not Only on the Surface, But Also in the Comparison in the Experiment <a href="#e316" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c316" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">316</a></h3>
<p>Vice President Kong Xiangxi of the Executive Yuan delivered Premier Wang's address: "The difficulties we face today and the responsibilities we bear are unprecedented. If we do not come forward with precise knowledge, resilient sentiments, and a healthy physique, we will not only fail to help the nation and the country, but also harm them. The increase of knowledge and the cultivation of sentiments are based on physical exercise. This is our most urgent need at present. The Sixth National Games is a kind of self-experiment for our physical exercise in recent years. In this experiment, we can compare with the previous sessions of the results, can be compared with the physical strength of people in all countries, and can determine the direction of future efforts from this experiment. Therefore, the meaning of the National Games lies not only in the performance but also in the comparison in the experiment, so that we can check our own strength at any time and place, how we can save the country and seek existence in the face of difficulties, and how to choose the path to deepen our strength. This is what all the people of the country should work together. The participants of this National Games should understand the important significance of this experiment and comparison."</p>
<h3 id="e317">Chairman Chiang's Address: Taking Sports as an After-Work Activity, National Rejuvenation Based on Sports <a href="#e317" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c317" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">317</a></h3>
<p>Chairman Chiang's representative declared, "Special message to Mayor Wu of Shanghai and all the athletes of the National Games: The purpose of sports is to seek the average development of each individual's body and mind, so as to create a sound physique and a strong spirit. The purpose of competition is to cultivate discipline, cooperation, and courage to obey through regulated movements. These are all good remedies for the current state of the nation. Therefore, the promotion of sports should not be limited to schools, but should be popularized in society. It should not only focus on individual strengths, but should encourage the progress of the entire nation. The basic work of national rejuvenation is the most important. I have repeatedly promoted and instructed this over the years. I hope that all of you present today can understand this. Since the Shang and Zhou dynasties in ancient China, education in schools has placed equal emphasis on rites, music, archery, chariot driving, calligraphy, and mathematics. The so-called archery and chariot driving are equivalent to today's sports. At that time, the country was prosperous and the Chinese nation was prestigious and respected. Since the Jin and Tang dynasties, literature has been valued over martial arts, and the teaching of archery and chariot driving has declined. The physical strength of the people has become increasingly worse. When the Far Eastern Games were first established, our athletes were able to barely compete and compete with others. I thought that from then on, we would learn from each other, improve and popularize, and wash away the shame of our country's weakness. However, in recent sessions, track and field competitions have often been at the bottom of the list, and even often zero points. Other competitions are also mostly inferior to others. The reason is that, on the one hand, our country's sports have degenerated, and the athletes have not been trained consistently. On the other hand, others have been inspired by shame and have worked hard. One step back and one step forward, the distance is getting further and further. This is the reason for this. Speaking of this, I am very saddened. Today, the world's great powers and emerging countries are all united in their efforts to develop national sports and encourage them. Looking at the past and present, if we do not catch up and work hard, how can we compete for survival in this universe? If we examine this, the significance of this National Games and the mission of all the athletes in the future must be deeply understood. I deeply hope that the results of this National Games will excite the people of the country and create a consensus on engaging in sports. The continued efforts of the athletes will show the people of the country a good model for recognizing sports. Each of you should take sports as a lifelong after-work activity, and each of you should take promoting public sports as your greatest responsibility. In the future, the great cause of national rejuvenation should be built on the foundation of sports and a new era should be created at this National Games. I hope that all the athletes will encourage each other. Chiang Kai-shek. Zhirong Seal."</p>

There were a total of 60 teams, with 50 people in each team and one leader in each team, holding a team flag. At the head was a military band of 30 people, followed by the general team flag, which was yellow satin with red borders all around, decorated with Tai Chi patterns and the words "Shanghai Tai Chi Exercises". Each team stood in formation, and white lines were drawn in advance by the meeting, and each person's standing point also had a white mark, so the formation was neat and without any confusion. After the formation, the performance began, with Chu Minyi as the chief commander giving the command. Loudspeakers were installed on the rostrum, so the pronunciation was clear and could be heard throughout the venue. A total of 60 schools performed, and the movements were consistent and quite wonderful.</p>

<p>The Sixth National Games was held at the city center stadium at 10:00 AM yesterday, with the most solemn opening ceremony. The reporter was fortunate enough to attend the event and has recorded several trivial and interesting anecdotes to serve as a side report on the opening ceremony.</p>
<p>Chinese and Western Formal Attire</p>
<p>The Games rostrum was specially designed to accommodate Chinese and Western VIPs. Ambassadors and consuls from various countries, as well as military attachés, wore formal attire, with towering hats, and were elegant and dignified. The Games dispatched male and female ushers to diligently lead them to their seats. The Games officials, including Mayor Wu, also wore Chinese and Western formal attire, with blue robes and black jackets everywhere, which were eye-catching and complemented the Western formal attire. Mayor Wu was busy welcoming guests, standing on the steps and shouting greetings to the Russian Ambassador and the British Commissioner, etc., with great enthusiasm.</p>
<p>Welcoming the Chairman</p>
<p>Chairman Lin Sen of the National Government arrived at the Municipal Government before 10:00 AM yesterday, and Mayor Wu personally went to pick him up. At 10:15 AM, Chairman Lin, surrounded by Mayor Wu and others, slowly ascended the rostrum. The chairman wore a blue robe and black jacket, fabric shoes, and his silver beard fluttered, making him look majestic. The announcer reported on the wireless radio that the Chairman had arrived and asked everyone to stand up. The chairman smiled and nodded to the foreign guests and sat down. President Sun Ke of the Legislative Yuan and Vice President Kong Xiangxi of the Executive Yuan arrived a little later and sat to the left and right of the Chairman.</p>
<p>Parade of Athletes</p>
<p>When the athletes from various provinces and cities paraded, their costumes were colorful, their steps were neat, and their order was orderly. When they approached the rostrum, they all opened their steps, took off their hats and saluted. Chairman Lin and other foreign guests also stood up and applauded to welcome them. When the teams from Liaoning, Harbin, Rehe, Mongolia, Qinghai, Xikang, Suiyuan, and Malaya passed by, the applause lasted for several minutes. Chairman Lin also clapped his hands vigorously and shouted "Good!"</p>
<p>Mr. Chu's Leadership</p>
<p>Finally, Mr. Chu Minyi led the elementary school students in the city to perform Tai Chi. The costumes were donated by Premier Wang Jingwei for 2,500 yuan, and were all white, neat and solemn. Mr. Chu also changed into a white uniform similar to riding breeches, held a baton, and directed from the small rostrum. Mr. Chu's voice, with his unique vocal qualities, was broadcast over the radio on the platform, and was clearly audible throughout the venue. The elementary school students also directed as they wished and handled it with ease, as if Mr. Chu was performing on stage, and the audience praised him incessantly.</p>
<p>Camera Work</p>
<p>During the opening ceremony, the activities of the camera work were the most spectacular. Film crews, photojournalists, and male and female private photographers went up and down the rostrum to find targets and were the busiest. Many foreign guests' wives also brought small cameras to take pictures back and forth. It is estimated that there were at least dozens of cameras among the hundreds of thousands of people in the venue, so the temporary photo shops in the venue were all making three times the profit. A certain cartoonist immediately drew several quick sketches of the photographers, which were realistic and humorous. Mermaid Yang Xiuqiong was also one of the centers of the photographers. When the athletes paraded, the Yang sisters were at the front, and the sound of cameras chasing after them was incessant.</p>

<p>Yesterday's attendance was particularly enthusiastic. Ticket sales totaled $12,300. Although most spectators purchased tickets, some were unable to enter. The Organizing Committee issued a special notice stating: "The Sixth National Games opened yesterday, and the enthusiastic attendance of spectators is a testament to the genuine passion for sports among people from all walks of life in this city. We are deeply gratified. However, due to the venue being completely full with virtually no space available, some later arrivals with tickets were unable to enter. The Organizing Committee is deeply sorry. Therefore, a special arrangement has been made: those who have purchased ten-day tickets but were unable to enter, can use their complete and undamaged tickets (not torn) to enter and spectate on the eleventh, limited to one entry only. This arrangement will not be extended. This notice is hereby issued for public awareness, and we hope for your understanding."</p>

<p>Yesterday, there were three finals in men's and women's field events: women's shot put, men's high jump, and men's discus. The following is a summary of the finals:</p>
<h3 id="e325">Women's Shot Put Final: Shanghai Sweeps Top Spots. Chen Rongtang's First Place Performance Mediocre. Results Matched Our Prediction. <a href="#e325" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c325" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">325</a></h3>
<p>The first final for women was the women's shot put. The results for the top four matched this newspaper's predictions. The four female athletes from Shanghai swept the top four spots. Yesterday's women's shot put final lacked fierce competition, resulting in a mediocre performance that was quite disappointing. The fifth and sixth places were won by Wang Fengwu from Hebei and Pang Lu from Sichuan, which was a notable achievement. It was also a groundbreaking event for Sichuan Province in the National Games. The full results are recorded below:</p>
<p>(1) Chen Rongtang (Shanghai) 10.05 meters</p>
<p>(2) Pan Yingchu (Shanghai) 9.62 meters</p>
<p>(3) Ding Guimei (Shanghai) 9.546 meters</p>
<p>(4) Liang Yunsen (Shanghai) 9.03 meters</p>
<p>(5) Wang Fengwu (Hebei) 8.69 meters</p>
<p>(6) Pang Lu (Sichuan) 8.64 meters</p>
<h3 id="e326">Men's High Jump Final: Wu Bixian Wins Champion. Result: 1.80 Meters. Performance to be Reattempted Today. <a href="#e326" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c326" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">326</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's high jump final had over fifty participants. The finalists included Wu Bixian, Xu Wenkui, Liu Mingru, Qiu Guangxie, Yu Qingrong, Zhou Shizhao, and Ling Hongzhao. All seven cleared 1.735 meters. At 1.77 meters, Yu Qingrong, Qiu Guangxie, Liu Mingru, and Wu Bixian cleared the height, while Ling, Zhou, and Xu failed to clear it in three attempts. After repeated adjustments, Ling Hongzhao was eliminated. Xu Wenkui defeated Zhou Shizhao and secured fifth place, while Zhou Shizhao defeated Ling Hongzhao to take sixth place. At this point, only Yu Qingrong, Qiu Guangxie, Liu Mingru, and Wu Bixian remained. The bar was then raised to 1.80 meters. Yu, Qiu, and Liu all failed in three attempts. Wu Bixian also failed in two attempts. However, Wu is highly experienced and had scored points at the 10th Far Eastern Games. Therefore, he cleared 1.80 meters with a light and graceful posture. Yu, Qiu, and Liu competed for a long time before the final rankings were determined. The complete results are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Wu Bixian (Hubei) Result: 1.80 meters</p>
<p>(2) Qiu Guangxie (Shanghai) Result: 1.77 meters</p>
<p>(3) Yu Qingrong (Liaoning) Result: 1.77 meters</p>
<p>(4) Liu Mingru (Nanjing) Result: 1.77 meters</p>
<p>(5) Xu Zhikui (Shanghai) Result: 1.73 meters</p>
<p>(6) Zhou Shizhao (Jiangxi) Result: 1.73 meters. It was noted that Wu Bixian's 1.80 meters had potential for improvement, but it was stopped due to rain. Field events referee Zhang Jiwu mentioned that Wu would attempt to re-jump after the completion of football this morning. Therefore, Wu still has a chance to set a new record.</p>

<h3 id="e327">Men's Discus Final: Guo Qingrong Leads. Final Round to be Held Today. <a href="#e327" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c327" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">327</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's discus final was unfinished. Unfortunately, the weather turned unfavorable, and the final could not be completed. Those who qualified for the final were: Guo Jie (Qingrong), Liu Furun, Zhang Lingjia, Leng Peigen, Cheng Bichun, Wang Deng, the veteran Chen Baoqiu, and Liu Qixiu (who did not participate). Guo Jie's result was exceptional. One throw achieved the final record. Unfortunately, the weather spoiled the final, and all athletes were affected. Therefore, no outstanding results were achieved. As a result, each athlete must perform two more throws. This will be held today. The scores of the six finalists from yesterday are as follows. The final ranking will be determined by today's final. If today's results do not exceed yesterday's, then yesterday's results will be considered the official ones.</p>
<p>(1) Guo Jie (Liaoning) 37.605 meters</p>
<p>(2) Liu Furun (Hebei) 36.365 meters</p>
<p>(3) Zhang Lingjia (Beiping) 35.44 meters</p>
<p>(4) Leng Peigen (Nanjing) 35.11 meters</p>
<p>(5) Cheng Mengping (Shanghai) 34.725 meters</p>

<h3 id="e328">Track and Field Preliminary Rounds: Intermediate Hurdles Preliminary. Li Houda's Disqualification Regrettable. <a href="#e328" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c328" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">328</a></h3>
<p>The intermediate hurdles preliminary was divided into eight groups. The results were not particularly outstanding. Li Houda from Shanghai reached the finish line in 61 seconds. Unfortunately, he mistakenly stepped out of his lane, and the referee disqualified him. The audience was very sympathetic. In this event, Sun Huibei, Wang Jingtai, Tao Yingjie, and Jin Huaizhi are all experienced competitors. It is expected that the next final will be highly competitive.</p>
<h3 id="e329">100 Meter Preliminary: Liu Changchun Unexpectedly Behind <a href="#e329" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c329" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">329</a></h3>
<p>There were many talented athletes in the men's 100 meters. For the past five or six years, Liu had consistently held the championship title unchallenged. However, in today's preliminary, he was unexpectedly surpassed by Huang Feilong, which was quite a surprise. It was later learned that Liu was conserving his energy for the final battle, aiming to break his personal record of 10.7 seconds. In the second group of the 100-meter preliminary, Pin Rongzhong directly pursued Han Jinglin in the last twenty meters, crossing the finish line. Hao Chunde, a veteran in the sixth group, also performed well. It is said that Chuan Jincheng is a young and promising sprinter from Malaysia. He uses good force in his starting and finishing sprints. He has a reasonable stride and arm swing. He finished the preliminary in 11.1 seconds. There are high hopes for Chuan in this 100-meter race.</p>
<h3 id="e330">800 Meter Preliminary: High Hopes for Li Shiming <a href="#e330" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c330" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">330</a></h3>
<p>The 800-meter race was divided into four groups. In the second group, Liaoning athlete Li Shiming took the lead at the sound of the gun, running easily and leading by a large margin. His posture was graceful, and he reached the finish line. The second-place finisher was more than thirty meters behind. If he can work hard in the final, breaking the national record is a real possibility. Dong Shuzhao won the first group very comfortably. Jia Lianren was defeated by Li Yanxiang, carelessly losing ground.</p>
<h3 id="e331">Women's 50 Meter: Future Competition Will Be Spectacular <a href="#e331" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c331" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">331</a></h3>
<p>Shanghai athlete Jiao Yulian took the lead at the sound of the gun and reached the finish line unchallenged. She finished with a time of 7.1 seconds. It is hoped that she can work harder in the final and break the national record. Deng Yinjiao from Malaysia, Zhao Yunshan from Guangdong, and Li Sen from Shanghai, all have times around 7.1 or 7.2 seconds, making the competition quite interesting.</p>
<h3 id="e332">Predictions for Today's Track and Field Finals <a href="#e332" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c332" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">332</a></h3>
<p>Men's Shot Put</p>
<p>Chen Baoqiu gave up the discus competition yesterday and will focus on the shot put today. Therefore, Chen has hope of retaining his title. However, Liu Furun from Hebei is unstoppable and may surpass "Iron Bull" Chen. Other accomplished shot putters include Leng Peigen, Gong Wanyu, Zhou Shunsheng, Yang Yongcan, Zhang Jiechun, Liu Jingfeng, and Guan Hongda. Due to weather and field conditions, it will be difficult to break the national record.</p>
<p>Women's Long Jump</p>
<p>There are many talented athletes in the women's long jump final. Shanghai has Lu Shu, Li Sen, and Chen Zaichun. Jiangsu has Kuang Yuzhen and Li Yuanfen. Malaysia has Deng Yinjiao and Zheng Zhi. The long jump results are around 5 meters. The 50-meter sprint today has a second round and a final. It may be difficult to achieve ideal results due to the combination of the two. Second, third, and fourth places are predicted to go to Lu Shu, Pang Yuanyu, and Chen Ouji.</p>
<p>Men's 100 Meter Final</p>
<p>The championship in the 100-meter final belongs to Liu Changchun. However, it will be difficult to break the national record. Besides Liu, Chuan Jincheng from Nanyang has a chance of breaking the 11-second barrier, with a possible time of 10.8 or 10.9 seconds. Huang Feilong from Shanghai is also making rapid progress and has a chance of being selected. Zhao Bingheng and He Peigen from Guangdong, and Zeng Rongzhong from Jiangsu, will compete for fourth, fifth, and sixth place.</p>
<p>Women's 50 Meter</p>
<p>In yesterday's preliminary for the women's 50 meters, Jiao Yulian had a time of 7.1 seconds, Kuang Yinjiao had a time of 7.2 seconds, Li Yuanfen had a time of 7.2 seconds, Zhao Yunshan had a time of 7.2 seconds, and Li Sen also had a time of 7.2 seconds. The top positions are likely to be among these athletes. Zhang Jiezhen from Guangdong and Xu Aipu from Shanghai also have a chance of being selected.</p>

<p>Yesterday's men's and women's track finals consisted of one event. Besides the women's shot put, which was officially completed, the men's high jump also determined the rankings. However, the first-place winner, Wu Bixian, stopped at one meter eighty, needing to go higher, but was halted due to rain. Additionally, the men's discus final, although the top six performers had been selected, each still needed to throw twice, so the final was postponed to today.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the women's 50-meter semi-final and the men's 100-meter semi-final and 400-meter hurdles final were also unable to take place yesterday due to the rain. Therefore, they are all scheduled to be held today after the Far East vs. Malaya football match.</p>
<p>Liu Changchun Suffers a Minor Setback</p>
<p>In today's 100-meter preliminary race, fifth group, the general audience eagerly anticipated a glimpse of Liu Changchun. As a result, Mr. Liu, unhurriedly, secured the second position. The championship of this group was conceded to Huang Feilian. In today's 100-meter semi-final and final, Mr. Liu will surely display his lifelong skills.</p>
<p>Cheng Jinkuan Absent</p>
<p>Jiangsu representative Cheng Jinkuan, due to illness suffered the day before, did not accompany the Jiangsu team to Shanghai. Therefore, he was also absent from yesterday's 100-meter preliminary race.</p>
<p>Athletes from Border Regions Emerge</p>
<p>In yesterday's various preliminary races, many athletes from inland areas were selected, such as those from Qinghai, Jiangxi, and Fujian, all of whom were named in the preliminary selections, which is quite remarkable. Moreover, the scores of the Sichuan athletes in the women's shot put and the scores of the Jiangxi athletes in the men's high jump were unprecedented in previous events. Therefore, it is sufficient to prove that our country's sports have gradually progressed. According to Liu Changchun and Li,</p>

<p>Shiming told reporters that it is feared that this大会 [Dàhuì, literally "Grand Assembly"] will not have good results in track events, because the continuous cloudy days make it difficult for the human body muscles to relax. Secondly, from the beginning of the construction of this event venue, the track laying was not well done, the geology is too loose, and generally well-known athletes all sigh in vain, he said.</p>

<p>The soccer match between Malaya and Liaoning, originally scheduled for 4:00 PM yesterday at the athletics field, was postponed because the track and field competition was extended to 2:00 PM, thus conflicting with the soccer match time.

<h3 id="e336">Men's Basketball The Opening of the Basketball Tournament The Jiangxi Army Eliminated Henan Wins with 35 to 14 Technical Skills Not Good, Fouls Repeated <a href="#e336" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c336" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">336</a></h3>
<p>The basketball preliminary match between Henan and Jiangxi was the first basketball battle of the tournament, held at 2:00 PM yesterday. About 500 people watched. The technical skills of both sides were below the average level, and fouls were numerous. As many as four people were successively penalized off the court. The Henan team was slightly better in coordination, and their shooting was also more accurate than Jiangxi's. Therefore, they won with a score of 35 to 14.</p>
<p>First Battle</p>
<p>After referee Wu Demao blew the whistle to choose positions, the first war in this gymnasium began. Before contact for a few minutes, the Jiangxi team's defender fouled while intercepting the ball. Chen Zhaolin of the Henan team scored first. Liu, the center forward, made two free throws, both hitting the target. He, the left forward, was not willing to be lonely and scored another point, taking the lead 4-0. The Jiangxi army was busy stopping the war, seeking a good strategy, and after many battles, finally scored one point. Subsequently, Liu, the center forward, made a long shot, and after that, the score did not expand. The shots were weak and powerless, and the ball could not be thrown over the range. The first half ended with a loss of 7 to 19.</p>
<p>Fouls</p>
<p>After a short break, the two armies fought again. The Jiangxi army tried to avoid the dangerous situation, and the competition was fierce. However, because they were inland, they were not familiar with the rules, so the number of fouls was countless. The forward Li, the defender Wei Zhide Meng Qianxin, were successively sent off the court, and the entire Ning Zun was about to collapse. Henan entered the situation, and the result was 35 to 17.</p>

<p>The men's basketball game between Henan and Jiangxi had just ended when the women's army of Min and Xiang rose up. The Fujian team was the runner-up in the previous tournament, losing to Shanghai by only one point. Over the years, they have worked hard and vowed to avenge their shame. Their skills have improved more than before. When they entered the field in an orderly manner, wearing white clothes and green trousers, the colors were harmonious. They first practiced passing and shooting, rarely missing, and the surrounding applause was loud. The Hunan team was not weak either, but it was a pity that they met this strong enemy in the first battle, which was also bad luck in the game.</p>
<p>Initial Appearance Divided into Courts</p>
<p>After contact, both sides guarded closely, and the record could not be opened for a long time. The situation was extremely tense. The Min team was petite and exquisite, running fast and snatching lively. The Hunan girls were strong in physique and had the advantage of strength, so they formed a stalemate. Lin Suqing got Zhao Ayu's long pass, turned around and threw, and her posture was beautiful, so she got two points. The Hunan army had a free throw opportunity, and Chen, the center forward, waved her jade arm and also got one point. The first quarter was two to one.</p>
<p>Changing Strategy The Min Army Showed Its Power</p>
<p>After the start of the second quarter, the Xiamen girls changed their strategy, focusing on attacking from both sides. Xu Meilin's forward, like a butterfly wearing flowers, successively scored several goals. The Hunan army's defense was shaking, and their hands and feet were chaotic. The forward was also tightly guarded by Zhao and Lin, and they had no ability to move. Chen, the center forward, could not clap with one hand. Although she slightly scored several points, she could not make up for the trouble.</p>
<p>The Hunan Team Was Miserably Eliminated</p>
<p>After lemon time, the Min army saw that victory was in hand, and Chen changed the line slightly. Lin Xiuluo played as a forward, and the captain Zhao Ayu retired. The army was still strong. Lin Suqi was as agile as a monkey, and her cooperation with Wu Huilian was wonderful. Although the Hunan team tried their best to resist, they were rejected by tigers in front and wolves in the back. In the third and fourth quarters, they were miserably eliminated with a score of four to sixteen.</p>

<p>Two men's volleyball preliminary games were held on the opening day, and the women rested. In the first game, Hebei vs. Qingdao, the competition was quite fierce and there was still something to watch. The second game, Min vs. Xiang, was one-sided, and Fujian won with a straight set.</p>
<p>Hebei 21 to 17 15 to 21 21 to 15 21 to 10 wins Qingdao</p>
<p>Fujian 21 to 11 21 to 12 21 to 6 wins Hunan</p>
<p>(1) Hebei Wins Qingdao</p>
<p>At 1:00 PM, Qing Hebei cut the ribbon for the debut. At the beginning of the game, Wang Dachun of Hebei took the lead, and the serve was good. Although Qingdao did not lose its heavy stronghold, the front line of the road was already in chaos, so in less than ten minutes, it was seen that the difference was very far. Jiang Xisheng of Qingdao served and gained a little, but when changing the court, there was still a big mistake of 11 to 4. After that, Qingdao reorganized its spirit, responded to the rear, did not seek a fluke victory, but strictly guarded the gate, and it worked. However, the situation in the first half was very bad, and the game ended with 21 to 17. At the beginning of the second game, Qingdao changed its strategy again, attacking urgently in the middle and defending in the back row. The situation seemed to be slightly better, and Xianliang suddenly rushed like a hungry tiger. Chen Li of Hebei failed to make up for it, and he actually won a game. If he had confidence, he would lose Jingzhou carelessly, causing a situation of one game each with a difference of 15 to 21, six points. In the third game, Qingdao and Hebei made the same childish mistakes. One pair of straps, one gain and one loss, each had a coincidence. Still, Hebei returned the side with 15 to 21. The fourth game was a matter of life and death. The war came and went inevitably. However, both sides were also a mob, fighting to the death. It was just a situation of mechanical fighting, so there was very little excitement. As a result, 21 to 10, Hebei Qingdao, the score, referee Yu Jie, and Lian Rong are as follows:</p>
<p>(3) Fujian Wins Hunan</p>
<p>At 3:00, Fujian vs. Hunan was on the scene, referee Chen De, anxious, blew the whistle to start the fire, and Fujian served in the middle. Lin Yuanbo of Hunan returned the color, and from then on, they advanced and retreated, not giving in to each other. However, Fujian is indeed an old player in this way, and the pass is full. In a flash, he took the opportunity to go deep. Hunan, with the spirit of a newborn calf, did not relax, so the difference in the first half was only 11 to 9. After changing the court, the weather cleared, and the sun shone on Hunan, dazzling. Hunan suffered a lot. Fujian won the first game 21 to 11. In the second game, Fujian continued to put pressure, and the Xiang army was not the same as it was in those years. Under the invasion, there was no resistance, and it was quite difficult to get 21 to 12. In the third game, it was Lin Renxin's turn to serve. It was done in one go, and he scored seven points in a row. The veteran of Hunan not only could not resist, but also found it difficult to struggle. So the whole country gave way, and the score was 21 to 6.</p>

<p>The opening match of men's tennis included singles. Yesterday, there were two groups in total, which started simultaneously at 1:00 PM. As a result, Xu Lianpei and He Jialiu of Hong Kong defeated Zhao Tianfu and Zhao Yunsheng of Shanxi with a score of 2 to 0 respectively, and won the right to the next match. He is a veteran of tennis, and his hitting is steady. Xu is a famous player in Hong Kong. He once defeated Xu Chengji last year. In the previous National Games, he was very sharp. Recently, in the exhibition match, he also defeated Lin Wangsu. The skills of the two Zhao's were barely satisfactory, but their experience was insufficient, so they had to admit defeat. The results are listed below:</p>
<p>(1) Xu Pei (Hong Kong) 6-2 6-2 wins Zhao Tianfu (Jin)</p>
<p>(2) He Jia (Hong Kong) 6-1 6-1 wins Zhao Yunsheng (Jin)</p>

<p>The men's doubles competition started at 3:00 PM. According to the order, there were originally two groups of competitions, but Henan had registered to participate in the morning, but no players came to the meeting. Weihaiwei only had one representative, so they all forfeited. Therefore, Malaya and Java won the right to the next match without any effort, and the hundreds of spectators who came to admire Xu Chengji, the young tennis player from Java, also returned disappointed. As scheduled, there was only one group of Hunan vs. Anhui. Hunan was represented by Ling Zhiyang and Li Shikang, and Anhui was represented by Zhu and Wu Zhang Mingqin. The technical skills of both sides were average, and there was nothing to say. However, the strength was still considered average, so the competition was divided into three sets to determine the winner. The result is as follows:</p>
<p>Ling Zhiyang Li Shikang (Xiang 4-6 6-2 6-1 wins Zhu Ying Zhang Mingqin (Wan)</p>
<h3 id="e341">Shanghai Pillar Lin Baohua's Physical Discomfort He May Not Be Able to Attend the Competition <a href="#e341" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c341" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">341</a></h3>
<p>Lin Bao, Shanghai's first singles player, may not be able to attend the competition recently due to physical discomfort. If this is true, then Shanghai's hope for the tennis championship is dim. Because the tennis order of this tournament gathers the strongest singles players from each unit together, and the weaker ones are also gathered together. If the first singles player cannot attend, the second singles player will take over, and the rest will be supplemented in order. Once the ranking is determined, it cannot be changed. In the first singles group, Xu Lianpei of Hong Kong will meet Xu Chengji of Java in the next match, and Wang Wenzheng of Sichuan will meet Xu in the semi-repechage. It is bound to be eliminated. Shanghai's strong enemy has lost most of it, and it will only meet Lin in the semi-repechage, so it is very likely to win the right to the repechage. In the second singles group, if Shanghai appoints Qiu Feihai as the representative, it can reach the final. If this is the case, although the singles championship is hopeless, the hope for the second and third places is very strong. If the doubles can win, the tennis championship can still be maintained. Otherwise, Qiu will be the first singles, even if he can win the right to the repechage, but no one will succeed Qiu. In the second singles group, Chen Qi'an of Malaya or Zeng Duancai of Java will definitely win the right to the final. In this case, Qiu will at most get second place, and if Lin does not attend, the hope for doubles is gone. Shanghai's championship is hopeless. Whether Lin will attend or not will be clear today.</p>
<p>Participating in Two Units Wu Bixian's High Jump Has Problems The Competition Committee Notifies Him to Stop Participating</p>
<p>As a result of the second meeting of the大会 Competition Committee the day before, an important principle was resolved, which was recorded in yesterday's newspaper. Regarding athletes who participate in two units, their qualifications to participate in this tournament must be cancelled. It is heard that the Competition Committee has discovered that Wu Bixian, the high jump representative of Hubei Province, had participated in the pre-selection in the rainy area. Wu Dǎng participated in the pre-selection in Hebei Province at that time, but was not admitted for some reason. Later, Wu registered with Hubei Province and was able to represent Hubei Province to attend. Today, the Competition Committee has sent a letter to the general leader of Hubei Province, asking him to stop participating. However, Wu had won the high jump championship before receiving the notice, so how to solve it is still unknown.</p>

<p>Yesterday, there were four groups of women's tennis singles, which started simultaneously at 1:00 PM. The situation in each group was very different, and they all became one-sided, with very little excitement and no interest. Except for the Guangdong and Hubei groups, which had a little competition, Mao Yuwen of Shanghai won all the games with two bagels, and Wei's victory over Cui was also very easy. The comparison is as follows:</p>

<p>C. Refereeing Standards</p>
<p>The above solo boxing competition for both men's and women's groups is also known as an exhibition match. The refereeing standards for each male and female contestant are divided into (1) Posture, (2) Movement, and (3) Exercise three items. Fair scoring is added to each item, and the total score of the three items is divided by 15. The resulting number is the individual score. Yesterday's preliminary round selected 12 men and women each. During the finals, 6 people will be selected from each of the 12 people as the final winners.</p>
<p>Chief Referee Expresses Satisfaction</p>
<p>Chu Minyi, the chief referee of the national martial arts competition group, told reporters during the solo boxing competition that there are 38 units in this National Games, but only 18 units participated in the martial arts competition. Therefore, it cannot be as enthusiastic as participating in other competitions. One reason is that many provinces have not yet established national martial arts halls. Secondly, because there is no establishment of national martial arts halls, it is also more difficult to select martial arts athletes. However, all the units that did not participate this time sent personnel to the meeting to observe, as a reference for the next conference. I think this is a good phenomenon. There are a total of seven martial arts competitions this time, of which boxing and weaponry are both exhibition competitions. The so-called comparison is not between Unit A and Unit B, but the unit itself competing against itself. All others are called competitions. Furthermore, the reason why I advocate for martial arts without sparing any effort is to seek the universality of martial arts. Based on the results of today's observation, men's boxing is certainly more exciting, but the progress of women's boxing is particularly rapid, which is very gratifying.</p>

<p>Minister of Education Wang Shijie and Mayor Wu Tiecheng are scheduled to host a banquet at 6 PM tonight in the City Hall Auditorium, inviting head delegates and leaders from various provinces and cities, as well as art committee members to accompany them.</p>
<h3 id="e346">Quick Sketches of the Athletes' Parade <a href="#e346" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c346" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">346</a></h3>
<p>Brawny Men as Flag Bearers</p>
<p>The flag bearers of each unit are all brawny men over six feet tall, with two athletes supporting them on either side, giving the impression of heroes and beauties. Among the flag bearers, the most eye-catching are Zhang Xihu, a famous tall man from the Zhejiang team, and Zhang Ge from the Shanghai team. The height of these two is unmatched among the flag bearers of each unit. Chen Zhenxing, a handsome man, serves as the flag bearer for Xiangman, with the mermaid Yang Xiuqiong and her sister Xiuzhen serving on either side, forming a delightful contrast of red flowers and green leaves.</p>
<p>Many Fat People Among the Beiping Athletes</p>
<p>There are particularly many fat people among the Beiping athletes. Some look like the big fat doll from Huishan, while others look like executioners from a city god temple parade, swaying back and forth, making people laugh. If weighed, they would be at least over 250 pounds, truly hard to bear.</p>
<p>Mongolian Athletes' Bald Heads</p>
<p>Among the units, the most notable are the athletes from the border provinces, who have traveled far and wide to participate, which is commendable. The Mongolian athletes are all bald, with bare heads, causing the audience to burst into laughter. Their limelight is so strong that the bald heads of Shanxi can no longer claim exclusive attention.</p>
<p>Henan Athletes Are All Elderly</p>
<p>The Henan athletes are dressed in green uniforms, resembling a team of postmen. Among them are several martial arts athletes, all with white hair and sideburns reaching their necks. The oldest is nearly 70 years old, but they are still vigorous in their old age, able to shoot through a hundred paces and hit the target every time, which is admirable.</p>
<p>Audiences Endure Watching the Flags of the Four Provinces</p>
<p>The four northeastern provinces have been lost for a long time. This time, at the National Games, the four provinces also sent athletes to participate. As the parade passed by, although the audience greeted them with smiling eyes, their hearts were filled with a mixture of sourness and bitterness. Most of the unit flags are yellow with red characters, white characters, or blue, etc. Only the flags of Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, and Rehe provinces are white on top and black on the bottom, with black and white characters, representing the Black Mountains and White Waters, and a map of the lost territories in the middle. How can one not feel heartbroken when looking at them?</p>

<p>Various groups and factories in Shanghai have arranged to host banquets for team leaders and athletes from various units. The schedule has been coordinated with the reception group of the conference as follows: On October 11th at 7 PM, the China Student Weekly will host a banquet for the team leaders of various units at the Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA. On October 15th at 5 PM, the Shanghai University Federation will hold a tea party at the Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA, attended by the team leaders of various units. On October 17th at 4 PM, six factories, including the Wuhe Weaving Factory, Zhanghua Woolen Fabric Factory, Meiya Silk Weaving Factory, China Chemical Industry Company, China Enamel Factory, and Hongxiang Dyeing and Weaving Factory, will jointly hold a tea party at the International Hotel on Jing'an Temple Road, attended by all the female athletes of this National Games. The factories will provide transportation to and from the event.</p>

<p>Stimulant</p>
<p>The athletes' parade was solemn and magnificent, with the participation of border provinces and cities, as well as the four northeastern provinces. The flag colors were uniform, but different from those of other units, with an extra border and a map. The audience all understood this during the parade, which is what is meant by "understood without words." However, the thunderous applause indicated that they had already taken a dose of stimulating excitement.</p>
<p>Hot and Sour Soup</p>
<p>The conference takes the moral aspects of the Games seriously, and strictly prohibits athletes who sit on the fence. The matter is quite acidic on the favorable side before it is resolved, while it is deeply spicy on the side being resolved. Observers believe it is a hot and sour soup with two kinds of feelings but a common stimulus.</p>
<p>Cooling Powder</p>
<p>Before the preliminary rounds, each unit holds high hopes, but as the situation suddenly changes, their momentum suddenly declines. One hot and one cold, like a spirit or an echo, is a cooling powder in the scorching heat.</p>
<h3 id="e349">Snippets <a href="#e349" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c349" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">349</a></h3>
<p>Special Boxes in the Gymnasium</p>
<p>The female athletes' dormitory is under the grandstand around the gymnasium, with several small windows offering a direct view of the basketball court. When the basketball game starts, the female athletes all occupy the windows to watch. Some say they are special boxes.</p>
<p>The Mermaid Is Heavily Surrounded</p>
<p>The mermaid Yang Xiuqiong's fame is almost known to every woman and child. Those who want to catch a glimpse of her beauty number in the millions. During the athletes' parade, the Yang sisters flanked the flag, but the audience felt regretful because the focal point was too far away, like viewing flowers through a mist. Therefore, they waited together at the West Gate, waiting to surround her when she left the venue. Reporters and non-reporters alike scrambled, with flashbulbs and cameras going non-stop. The mermaid was very embarrassed. Fortunately, she was protected and broke through by male athletes from her team.</p>
<p>Chu Minyi Takes Off His Clothes to Direct</p>
<p>The Tai Chi exercise performed by thousands of elementary school students was directed by Chu Minyi as the general director. At first, the entire group circled the field, and then he went back and forth to direct, setting up formations and running around extremely busily. When he went on stage illegally, he removed his helmet and armor, and went on stage in short clothes, displaying the威風威風 of Zhang Fei fighting Ma Chao.</p>
<p>Xinjiang Athletes Travel Far with Difficulty</p>
<p>The reporter met yesterday with Ai She, the instructor of Xinjiang, who said that the team had traveled a long distance this time, departing from Xinjiang and arriving in Shanghai, taking more than two months. The team relied on walking and camels when passing through Gansu and Shaanxi, enduring hardship and suffering. The small caps worn by the team's athletes are Muslim-style and have a unique charm.</p>
<p>Chairman Lin Praises Tai Chi Exercise</p>
<p>Yesterday's Tai Chi exercise performance was quite wonderful. It was the result of Chu Minyi and the coaches' painstaking efforts over the past six months. Yesterday, the entire audience praised it, and Chairman Lin of the National Government applauded and praised every exquisite movement.</p>
<p>Jiangxi Province Values One Point</p>
<p>Jiangxi Province's sports are infantile, and they have never scored in the National Games. This time, they surprisingly won a valuable point, which was a pleasant surprise. Zhou Shizhao's sixth place in the high jump final was not easy. It is heard that Zhou currently works at the Nanchang Bank of China, and his usual highest record is 1.82 meters. This time, he was unable to fully display his talents.</p>
<p>Southeastern Female Students Busy with Reception</p>
<p>Yesterday, many foreign guests and central dignitaries attended, and the reception work of the conference was extremely important. Students from the Southeast Women's Physical Education School were specially hired to be on duty at the rostrum to receive guests. The uniforms were custom-made by the conference, and they were gentle, polite, and well-mannered. They were particularly convenient and appropriate when receiving foreign guests, which was a credit to the conference.</p>
