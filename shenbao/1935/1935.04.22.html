<h3 id="c41">歡迎美國經濟考察團 <a href="#c41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>— 仁</p>
<p>喧騰社會已久之美國經濟考察團。將於今日抵派矣。該團團員。多爲美國工商界頒袖。而團長福勃斯氏與副團長卡羅爾氏則均熟悉東方情形。此行預計在華有兩個月之覊留。以言時日。雖不可謂畏久。但以言使命。則不可謂不大。此行不獨在中美兩國邦交上爲有歷史的價値者。抑且在中美兩國貿易前途。或竟因而能發見一光芒之坦道。吾人茲敬以赤誠。歡迎此來自新大陸之遠客。並貢其所見焉。</p>
<p>十字軍後。歐亞交易頻繁。西人莫不知亞洲之廣大。迨馬哥波羅（Marcopolo）仕元廷。歸著「東方見聞錄（Dictations）。於是西人又莫不知亞洲爲富庶。當時之所謂亞洲。殆以中國爲代表。目之爲「天上人間。」稱之爲黃金東方（GoldenEast）。而是時西人之來東方者。多帶好奇冒險之性質。而非有關於一國之經濟貿易政策者。其後交通術日臻進步。東西往還便捷。加之鴉片戰爭之筏。我國海禁大開。於是各國人士之來華者益衆。而中國與各國間亦遂有正式經濟之關係。且使中國亦成爲世界經濤之一環。而有彼此休戚相關之誼。在此歷中演變之中。吾人與美國之國際關係。雖發生較晚。但中美兩國人十。輒相曰以誠。持乏以雜。故中美兩國邦。　素稱輯陸。　　十年來。未嘗稍渝。卽以中美之貿易關係論。去年中國對美之輸出爲九千四百四十餘萬元。輸入爲二億七千二百萬元。占列國對華輸入之首位。以兩國之經濟合作論。如精琦氏對中國幣制之提出改革案。史密十氏對中國鐵路之提出改革案。甘末爾氏對中國採用金本位之提出方案。若此數端。要皆可以表示中美兩國在經濟關係上固亦向頗密切也。</p>
<p>在過去。中美兩國旣有深厚之友誼。則此友誼。吾人自希望其能永遠保存於今後。是以吾人於可能範圍以內。當竭誠爲美國助。而美國於可能範圍以內。亦當竭誠爲吾人助。年來中國災害頻仍。饑饉囂年。兼之受世界恐慌之影響。人民購買力。已逈異往昔。故對外貿易亦不得已而日趨於銳减。今考察團諸公遠道而來。吾人深望其於此有一詳細之研究。用歸納之方法。以遠大之眼光。考察其購買力减退之原因與現狀。及其援助之方法。夫中美貿易前途如何。乃爲今後兩國經濟關係上最根本之問題。而中美貿易前途。能否有一新的展開。實卽看此購買力能否有一新的增加。不此之圖。而欲在今日購買力上求中美貿易之發展。誠無異於竭澤而漁。不特對中國爲無私。在美國亦非得策。換言之。在今日現狀之下。中國之最感急切者。爲依經濟之建設以求人民購買力之加增。目前吾人雖無時不以最大之努力。求「新中國」之產生。但友邦之美國。若再能於此加助力。則中國購買力當易恢復。而中美貿易之發展。亦庶幾有　。此吾人於歡迎之餘。望考察團諸公注意者一。</p>
<p>雖然。美國於中國購買力之增進。固非漠不關心者。若白銀銀價之提高。其目的要亦不外求遠束購買力之提高。但此白銀政策。行之將及一載。而吾人就已成之事實而論。則結果與美國之所望者。適成背道之勢。白銀價格提高以還。中國存銀卽源源外流。截至目前止。大約已在四五萬萬元以上。此種事象之發生。當非美國始料所及。中國目前合全國之白銀而計之。約爲十五萬萬元。中國之存銀日减。中國人民之購買力並未有反比例之變化。假使購買手段之白銀流凈。中國幣制上勢有一大波瀾。此不僅於中美貿易之發展爲無益。成竟因此而將於數十年來中美親善之前途。投一暗影。亦未可知。此吾人於歡迎之餘。望考察團諸公注意者二。</p>
<p>今日者察團之諸公。皆平素直接間接與中國之有往還者。故其調查與考察。吾人固深信其必有極大之成就。他日歸去。不特將影響於美國之實業界。而中國當亦將受其影響。助人郎所以自助。吾人極願爲美國助。美國當亦爲吾人助。故中美兩國經濟之互助互榮。吾人深望於此考察團考察以後。能有更進一步之發展也。</p>

<p>（倫敦）德國反對日內瓦决議之牒文、今日仍爲世界舞台之中心、各國首都皆謠啄繁興、惟大多數人咸以爲德國之此項答覆與其謂爲對付他國、不如目爲聊平德國人民之憤慨而已、巴黎羅馬皆以爲不足重視、日本雖稱之爲係「絕對拒絕國聯之行動」、然亦謂「將來討論之門戶尙未關閉」、此間官塲方面、則覺字裏行間、德國外交界猶有重返國聯之意、惟同時德國亦將堅持其不顧凡爾賽和約、而維持其重整軍備計畫之初衷耳、法國官塲今日表示、日內瓦之决議、係行政院之全體行動、故各國除以德國之抗議備案之外、不能有何其他舉動云、（廿一日國民電）</p>
<p>（柏林）據外交界消息、國際間現正進行之各項談判、德國仍有參加之可能、本日午後德國因國聯會行政院决議案、對於英法意各國所提出之抗議、一般人原以爲措詞必甚粗率、不合外交慣例、迨發出後幷不如是、足見希特勒元首接受外交當局之勸吿、而以緩和形式出之、然則德國參加國際談判之可能、已由外交當局設法加以保留矣（二十日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（柏林）各報紛紛攻擊國聯會、其語氣雖屬高傲、但言外之意、則表示德國在其抗議書中仍爲未來談判預留地步、例如柏林日報謂、「日內瓦人土盲目而行、吾人當有以啟導之、吾德各鄰國、杯弓蛇影、吾人當有以曉諭之」云、（廿一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）各報評論德國抗議書、皆謂詞意激烈、不若預料之甚、「小巴黎人報」謂「希特勒左右有作溫和主張、亦有作激烈主張者、觀于抗議書、卽知溫和派已占優勢」、「小日報」對於德國抗議書不甚重視、謂「其目的僅欲表明見解、而不以緘默自甘、至德國對於國聯會决議案之眞正答案、眞正辯護詞、則主管機關正在草擬中、」事業報論調與此相同、幷謂「所不可知者、德國所謂表明立塲、究係如何」斐伽羅報謂、德國所舉理由、在法理上毫無價値、至所謂行政院决議案、係屬一種差別待遇、尤屬莫明其妙、但「以抗議書詞意而論、則德國並無拒絕談判之意明矣」云、（廿一日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>在別處，「人」是「人」，在上海「人」卻變了「金錢」·你看：早上，和漁悅色的車夫，把「人」當車錢」載了走。書問，大减價的商店，吹吹打打的，當「人」是「物的代價」，歡迎主顧；夜裏，二房東般殷勸勸，當「人」是「房租」，開門讓進。</p>
<p>田間的農夫農婦，「坑育·杭育……」地，共同把農作物挑回家去，我看了，只是欽佩、百貨商店裏的洋式夫婦，「喞喞噥噥」手臂挽手臂地跑上跑下，我看了，只是肉麻。</p>
<p>可膏，我覺得我睡在我愛人的手臂裏，我的胸口緊緊地貼着伊的胸口，但是開眼一看，我仍然孤零零地擁被獨宿着，在這一刹那，我才覺得失愛的痛苦。</p>

<p>春日西湖，靠它為生的，不知有多少人；所以，杭人有「三冬靠一春」之語。按西湖最盛於春，不但現今如此，自昔已然、明瞿宗吉有西湖四時望江南詞，其描寫當時西湖春景云：「西湖景，春日最宜晴。花底管絃公子宴，水邊羅綺麗人行，十里按歌聲。」這已是怎樣的繁華！然宋末時的西湖春景，其繁華更有甚於明代者。茲摘錄元白廷玉西湖賦中一節如左，以見一斑：</p>
<p>別有龍舟兩兩，　鼓馮馮，陳百戲於水面，豎六標於湖心。……觀者舟兩行，如廣陌：迓者錦萬竿，如長林。五步一亭，酒飾茶祻。笙歌沸騰，軒鞅紛紜。柳行撲地，花陣排雲。梭門秋千，出沒乎翠　；舞衣歌扇，周旋乎香塵。…目不暇瞬，步不得循。想見淮魯羹之宋嫂，猶多呈鶴舞之優人。剪羅饤採花之盤，範飴為穿柳之鱗。飾木兵於小桁，串家具於修筠。篙矢激半空之霹靂，紙鳶競九天之經綸。拓彈象弩，畫棍潑盆。（原註，踏混才·潑臣盆·皆水戲）羅襪凌波，金釵照春。時固多攬紅拾翠之子，亦豈無尋幽討勝之賓？此特言萬一於春九十之辰。」</p>
<p>按廷玉生於理宗時。上所云云，蓋賦宋末西湖春景，其熱鬧較之庾信春賦。無遜色。然當時國家已危若累卵，而人民猶粉飾太平，醉生夢死如此；我們讀了，怎能不掩卷長歎呢！</p>
<h3 id="c153">公子鷂 <a href="#c153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>— 顔</p>
<p>由首都雨花台十五萬人的觀風箏大比賽，想起了二十年前常熟的公顏子鷂。凡風箏的取名，都以其形狀像什麽呌什麽，如鷹鷂蝴蝶鷂蜈蚣鷂等皆是。獨此公子鷂則以放的人而得名，所以公子鷂者，就是公子少爺所玩弄之鶴也。</p>
<p>公子鷂不以巨大競勝，而以小巧玲瓏是尙。取織細光滑的竹篾，為鷂骨，上糊以蟬翼之紗，可張可縮，張則五色繽紛，美麗絕倫，縮則摺疊如扇，置於囊中。囊製也很精美，以錦綢為料，刺繡花鳥虫魚，並綴纓絡，類多出自閨秀之手，鷂置錦囊，囊懸腰際，猶昔日書生雅煽之懸於腰帶然。放鷂之繩，也捨粗麻而用白絲，彩色之鷂，配以潔白之綫，更相得而益美了。</p>
<p>春光明媚，春風柔和，公子少爺相約到郊外競放風箏為戲。每一公子身後，必有僕人相隨，相助理絲縱鷂。或自己牽引，或交僕人之手，而在旁引領觀賞。花花鴿子在天上穩立風中，輕盈自得。花花公子在地下緩步往來，軟語輕笑。春光旖旎，鷂子旖旎，公子旖旎，這一個旖旎風光，好不樂死人也麽哥。到得興盡時，再命僕人相助繞綫收鷂，依然納鷂於錦囊中，腰間繫着，沿着斜陽晚風，緩緩歸去。</p>
<p>近年來到處不景氣，資產階級也都衰落，公子少爺的資格根本不復存在，所以這二十年前的韻事，也不復見於今日了。區區放風箏的樂意事，也在這世運叩起了滄桑之感，可嘆呵！</p>

<p>第十二回　慚愧沒衣裳垂帷避客辛勤省膏火拂曉抄書</p>
<p>北海聽說是月英在這裏，自己也感到臉上有些發熱。他就想着，這是什麽原故？程先生讓他睡在自己床上，自己倒躲了開去，假如有個有身分的生朋友來了，豈不要發生誤會？不管什麽嫌疑了，我得坐在這屋子裏看功課，假如有人來了，我也可以替程先生分說分說。他如此想着，又走進房去，也不管床上的人，自在進門靠窗戶的桌子邊坐下，將帶來的書本，在桌上攤開來看。月英在帳子裏面，向外看得淸楚，明知王北海這個人是很規矩的，不會有什麽舉動，不過自己一絲不掛，睡在別人床上，這總是很害臊的事情。自己心神不安，只管在床上翻來覆去。北海這倒有些忍耐不住了，於是向他帳子裏面道：裏面是朱姑娘嗎？你是不是受了戚胃了？月英不好意思答應，依舊是默然的躺着。北海見桌上放着暖水瓶，用手捧時，瓶子很沉重，自然是裏面盛得有水。便道：朱姑娘，這裏有熱水，我倒一杯給你喝，好嗎？月英見人家如此的殷勤，不好意思，再不理會了，便答應着不敢當。北海於是搬了個方凳子，放到床面前，就倒了一大杯熱水，加上茶壺嘉的茶滷，小小心心的，給他放到方凳上。這就向帳子裏笑道：你自己拿着喝罷。（一八七）</p>

<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>伊們還有一個特點，就是富有「藝工」的精神，所謂藝工的精神，便是只為了「藝術」和「工作」而工作的意思。伊們每做成一雙鳳鞋，時間上至少就得費一個月，而在這一個月以內，伊們為着一雙鳳鞋而所費的心力，更是無可限量；但伊們努力的結果，却只有大后一個人可以見得到，卽使給太后愛上了而御用起來，也不過我們這寥寥幾個人得有欣賞的機會。此外更有誰能發現伊們的巧妙的工技？所以伊們當製作的時候，就絕不存心想藉此誇耀於大衆，一心只是想把這一項工藝做得如自己理想一般的完美而已！何况伊們所做成的亂鞋，多數是給太后打進了冷宮，永遠讓了兩個飽食無事的老太監看守起來的，根本沒有問世機會，伊們等於白白的努力了一塲。但伊們並不灰心，仍用盡心力的工作；這種精神，豈是尋常的一般藝術家和大工匠所能有的？</p>
<p>這些小姑娘們旣在這樣特殊的環境中過着超特的生活，伊們本身的思想也就不免因此而變得很別緻，看起來伊們對於出嫁和餐育子女的事，實在是非常漠視的。我也曾間接的聽到過伊們的言論，大致對於現狀都很滿足。伊們把那些一方一方的貢緞看做是伊們的丈夫，又把那些一絞一絞的絲線看做伊們的子女；伊們的內心上，也確乎是很愛好這兩伴常和伊們做伴侶的東西的。（二九七）</p>
<h3 id="c156">外國人與狗 <a href="#c156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>— 怡怡館主</p>
<p>在這被譽為「東方巴黎」的上海，無論是在英租界，或是法租界的馬路上。時常瞧見一般「外國人」，尤其是一般「外國女人」，在散步着。十有八九是牽着一頭狗，或二頭，或茶而至於三頭，也有的。大的小的，各色各樣，搖頭擺尾，隨着它們的主人走，或是在前面帶了它們的主人跑。</p>
<p>有時間，嗚地一輛「摩托卡」，駛了過去。裏面除了坐着的「外國人」之外，往往還有這麽一條狗，蹲伏其上。昂着頭，吐着舌，雄糾糾地脾睨着一切！因此，它的主人，似乎更顯得威風。</p>
<p>不知怎的，我從這些上，不由的會使我想起租界上的公園，在從前尙未開放的時候，「華人與狗」，是「不准入內」的。當時、我們華人，都認為是侮辱！然而，於今看到了「外國人」與狗，那樣的「形影不離」這纔使我恍然！覺得那時所謂「華人與狗不准入內」，這一句裏面的「狗」字，實在指的還是華人所畜的狗！至於「外國狗」，當然，是不在其列的。否則，如果「外國狗」進出公園也受了拘束，那麼，講問它們的主人，願不願？</p>
<p>唉！這樣看來，當初那一條「華人與狗不准入內」的吿示，無異是昭吿華人說：「惟外國人與外國狗，纔可以進去！」細想起來，彼此一樣，何辱之有呢？呵呵！</p>

<p>— 吉雲</p>
<p>橫濱在日本大地震時受災最重，全市幾成平地。經十餘年的苦鬥，表面　設，已有超過災前的現象。博覽會是紀念復與運動，所以都是各地物產的陳列所。該會山橫濱市發起，各縣都有加入。屬地如朝鮮台灣南洋統治地等，也有出品。另有滿洲暹遜兩館，該處並未受震，也未復興，濫芋厠入，眞是不倫不類。</p>
<p>開港紀念館中，陳列着橫濱女化進步的歷史，電話汽車自來水的建設都用圖書模型表示。外面門口坐着兩個日人，穿着開港時警察的服裝。圓椎形的笠帽，茶色短衣，頸後有一個白色旭字，不知是何用意。腰揷倭刀。　邊還有舊式的刀槍架子，揷着各種長柄武器。</p>
<p>復興館裏有許多災時慘狀的照片；使人回想到地震時的極度恐懼。一張丈餘的地圖，是由飛機攝影集成的，當然詳細正確。高大的洋房，僅如一粟，旁有放大鏡以濟目力的不足。</p>
<p>此次博覽會的上面雖然也有一個大字，實際很小。除了橫濱山下公園全部，另有一處在馬路的對而，地方更小。中間又被馬路分為兩部，他們就造了木橋，以渡覜衆，方法滑糟之至。大規模的機器，搬運不便，參加的很少。各館內容大都是輕工業金屬製造品和漆工，泥江木工布匹日用品罷了。</p>
<p>日本女子也用很小的摺扇，梯式和我國相同，白色大骨，木製小骨，扇面闊僅三四寸，反面比扇骨狹了。扇面和扇骨上都印着各種圖案花卉，顏色雅淡，十分新穎。日本製造用品，最大的特點，便能利用廢物。竹頭大屑，盡是材料。一片美麗的貝殼，上面粘着一个小人，便成飾物。和我國江北人在蚌殼裏置粉人，異曲同工。奈良有神鹿，成零的在樹林裏棲息，日人無敢加害者。那地人民就利用脫下的鹿角，做烟咀，飾物。</p>
<p>日本火柴大都是扁匣，中間僅能容三十餘支，售洋一分。大商店常將廣吿貼在上面，送給雇客，每人可得四五匣。所以在日本吃香烟，簡直不必再買火柴。匣子上面廣吿，金銀彩色，小而精繳。日本印刷費是十分便宜的。</p>

<p>（北平快訊）最近上海工部局華人敎育處長陳鶴琴氏「又談注音漢字之利弊問題」、對於國語統一會常委黎錦熙氏之談話、又有所辯解、今黎氏又有表示如下、</p>
<p>輔助工具</p>
<p>（一）陳君謂注音符號與標點符號繁簡不同、但完全的新式標點符號計十六種、幷非簡單之一一點一綫一、注音符號在國音中只用到三十七個、幷非漢字一波磔紛紜、變化繁多、」之可比、標點符號應與漢字文義合為一體、注音符號應與漢字讀音合為一體、其用相等、而其形皆必不致與漢字相混淆、閱讀者得此兩種輔助工具、大可節省時間、增加了解能力、毫無疑義、</p>
<p>事實未合</p>
<p>（二）陳君調査日本報紙情形似與事實未合、日本普通報紙及通俗雜誌、除一二三等數目漢字例不注音外、凡漢字無不注音、陳君所謂「十字中不過一二」、殆指其高文典冊而言、則惟生僻漢字偶注假名耳、（據本人所見、晶本近出之文藝作品、較俗者、亦無不盡注假名、）至六號字這印刷物、本不應給兒童閱讀、若兒童讀物亦用六號字、即不注音、吾知陳君亦不能保證其不成近視限也、</p>
<p>免除危害</p>
<p>（三）在敎學過程中、應訓練閱讀者注音集中於漢字、不識之字、帝看注意何來「擾亂」、若無注音、對於漢字誤認誤訊、乃是事實、豈有因注音而反致錯誤之理、若有注音、不識之字、旁看即得、至少可省去亂找宇典東詢西問之煩、豈有因注音而反致費時之理、陳君所舉各種危害、正起於漢字旁無注音、惟有推行注昔漢字、始可免除此等危害、</p>
<p>喧賓奪主</p>
<p>（四）凡問題皆當作實騐的研究、惟研究之工具及條件必須完備、數年前、有友人恐漢字注音、將來喧賓奪主、兒童只識注音、忽略漢字、因在此間東城一個平民小學從事實騐、一年之後、此班學生認識漢字轉多、彼認為滿意、遂贊成注音符號、但此種實騐　以為靠不住、因其所用之材料、只是一種油印注音課本、及每日注音號報而巳、將來注音符號是否喧賓奪主、在本人雖不加考慮、但友人據此而决、未免革草、故必須準備注音漢字模、印出多量的讀物、方可施行種種研究、否則有損於學術專家研究之眞實性、</p>
<p>主要目的</p>
<p>（五）陳君今已視見南洋華僑國語敎育之功效、須知華僑學校之國語敎員、近年來即利用注音符號作敎授國語之工具、此亦共見共聞之事實、今所缺者、即此一注音符號與文字幷列之敎科書、及一般之注音讀物耳、據國語會南洋特務委員之報告、如有此種刋物、國語敎育及識字效能當更加擴大、蒙新兩地特委尤有此熱烈提議、此次請政府撥欵鑄造注音漢字銅模、其動機即半在邊疆敎育與華僑敎育耳、陳君所謂「統一國語、統一國音、」固其目的之一、而主要之目的更在輔助識字、增加國民敎育之效率、此點不容抹煞、國語曾提案所謂民衆施敎時間現極有限、而民族意識及各種常識之灌輸又刻不容緩、此種輔助識字之工具、更宜參法東瀛、永使聯繫、符號一熟、文義自明、聲入心通、事半功倍、區區之「重床疊屋、」又何必引以為嫌乎、</p>
<h3 id="c178">讀書建動十三日　王新命講研究文學 <a href="#c178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>昨為中國文化建設協會、主辦全國讀書運動大會之第十三日、該會特請王新命演講「怎樣研究文學」、茲錄演詞全文如次、</p>
<p>今天中國文化協會主辦的讀齊運動大會、要我來講「怎樣研究文學」的問題、我現在把我個人的意見聊備各位的參考、</p>
<p>普通看法、文學和自然科學·社會科學等的不同、自然科學是解釋自然界現象的學問、社會科學是解釋各種社會制度批評各種社會問題的工具、文學卻是描寫自然和社會的工具、自然科學社會科學偏重理智和現實、文軍偏重情感和理想、其實這不過是大概的區分法、我們倘再加以精細的考察、便會知道描寫自然和社會的文學、也帶有解釋自然現象、解釋各種社會制度和批評各種社會問題的任務、不過是在純粹理論的研究和完全情感的發揮上、自然科學社會科學和文學便有一個不可逾越的分水嶺罷了、</p>
<p>我們以為文學和自然科學社會科學之間有一個共同點、這個共同點就是都把充實人類的生活為前提、</p>
<p>瑞一般人都把文學看做沒有實際的學問、以為文學是一種不切實用的奢侈品、有也不為多、無也不為少、其實文學是很有貢獻的東西、不僅具有潛移社會默經人心的偉力、而用還發動驚天動地的風潮、例如柏拉圖的理想國、盧梭的天賦人權論、美國的獨立宣言、法國的馬賽曲、馬克斯的共產宣言、在當時都不過是一部小說、一篇文章或一首歌、但後來便都成為政治革命、社會革命的原動力、這便足以說明文學影響的偉大、</p>
<p>至於研究文學的方法、是隨研究文學的目的而不同的、現在我所希望大家研究的、是研究文學和他背景的關係、我們應該知道每一國每時代的文學、必然都附有他的特殊色彩、或是有鼓動征服他國向他族的風潮的色彩、或是激發反抗他國他族的情緒的色彩而形成為一種一國民的文學」、關於這一點我們可純在文學史中得到相當的證明、</p>
<p>比如我們中國明清兩代最流行於下層社會的文學、不都是以征伐他國他族為題材的小說和戲劇嗎、這個小說和戲劇的名稱實在太多、舉也不勝舉、一言以蔽之、總是「征西」「征東」「平南」「掃北」這此東西、裏面都是說中國同圍的某小國、忽然改變了向來恭順的態度、動員蠜兵入寇中國、最初中國沒有準備、蠜兵到處好像入了無人之境、後來皇帝勃然大怒、命將出征、大隊人馬浩浩蕩蕩殺到了某國、雖其初因為將帥無勇無謀、中了敵人的計、吃了幾仗敗仗、後來人業中跑出身高八九尺、　力過人的人、自告奪勇、蠜將做了他刀下之鬼、於是皇帝下詔班師、大賞羣臣、這種文學的產生、决不是偶然的、其背景就是當時一般人征伐慾的熾盛、此外還有一種以掃除漢奸為目標的文學、是因為當時士大夫的民族意識不明、一部分人有「伊川為」之懼、因而寫了許多反漢奸的說部和戲劇、　種文學、岳傳可做他的代表、岳傳裏面所容形的秦檜、便是他們所反對的標準的漢奸、</p>
<p>這不過是一例而已、其實這例、是舉不勝舉的、譬如波蘭未復國前的文學、全是提介民族自救的文學、韓國剛滅之時的文學、全是以恢復三韓為理想的文學、俄國十月革命後的文學全部懷着「資本主義向蘇俄進攻一的口號、也都足以證明文學和交學背影有不分的關係、有什麽背景、便應產生什麼文學、</p>
<p>再從純社會的見地來考察文學的發展、也是各國以其社會的意識形態而不同的、例如英國迭更司的小說、沙士比亞的戲劇、為什麼多半是描寫社會的黑暗面呢、這沒有別的原因、就是因為那時英國的社會是那樣的黑暗、他們想喚起一般人改造社會的意識、因此他便不能不努力抨擊黑暗的社會、</p>
<p>總之、在研究文學上、最重要的一件事是理解文學的背景、能理解他的背景、然後才能够知道他的中心意識、自己前進的路才不會讓「先入之見」塞住、</p>

<h3 id="c184">四十六年來金銀進出口統計之結果中國金銀尚有幾何 <a href="#c184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>— 柳塘</p>
<p>自金價貴而黃金滾滾以去，銀價貴而白銀又源源以往，中國至今尙握有金銀幾何，此一問題，恐無能作確切之答復。外人之不察我國情形者，以我爲用銀之國，並且別有懷抱，思以提高銀價之手段，遂其吸收操縱之企圖。奸商浪人，又復乘機作祟，私運偷稅。無惡不作。我人於艱苦備嘗之餘，固除奮力掙扎之外無他途。而於我切身有關之金銀出納狀况，不可不一察其究竟。</p>
<p>金銀出入有數字可稽者，自惟關冊。但據「六十五年來中國國際貿易統計」所載，海關報告冊之金銀銅進出口統計表，始於光緒二十年（一九〇四年），其前僅於報吿書中述及之。又據該統計表所載自光緒十五年（一八八九年）至民國十七年（一九二八年）爲止，此四十年中，黃金出超年份，占有二十七年，入超年份爲十二年。（光緒二十九年卽一九〇三年進出平，）白銀自光緒十六年（一八九〇年）起亦至民國十七年止，計三十九年，入超年份占有二十五年，出超年份占有十四年。於此可見黃金出超年份居多，白銀以入超年份爲多也。下表卽爲該統計表中所載金（四十年）銀（三十九年）逐年出入超數値之併計，及其出入超併計數相劑後之凈値也。</p>

<p>白銀在此四十五年中，出超占十七年，入超占二十八年，出入相抵，入超尙有十億四千一百八十二萬九千九百六十一元。如以四億四千萬人口分配之，則每人所得亦僅兩元，似此戔戔之數，雖中國舊有之存銀，尙未訐入在內，然爲數之無多，已灼然可見，奈何尙啓人覬覦之心，欲逼中國人竟無黃金白銀之可有，則中國固不了，彼豈亦得了耶！</p>
<h3 id="c185">國際貿易入超之新形勢 <a href="#c185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>— 余捷瓊</p>
<p>國際貿易的入超，是中國經濟的嚴重威脅。倘無年來巨額人超的累積，則白銀的外流，决不育如一年來的風浪險惡。自從銀出口徵稅之後，暫時覊留白銀於國內，然人力稍一放鬆，或國際市塲有更劇烈的變化，則白銀的外流，隨時可以出現。有如最近美國再度提高銀價，雖然找國關禁森嚴，而津厦等地，白銀私運之風，依然無法杜絕。且更有進者，果入超現象不設法消滅，則縱令白銀出口因課稅而停止，然爲平衡貿易差額計，遲早總有運現出口的必要。是以近來談中國之財政金融問題者，無不尋根究底，集矢於頻年貿易之入超。</p>
<p>貿易人超爲目前財政經濟金融日趨惡化的重要癥結，爲帝國主義者控制我國財政金融經濟的工具，要打破目前財政金融經濟上的保險局面，要排開外人太上的控制勢力，則消滅入超，爲當前之要圖，顧將採取何種步驟，運用何種方法，爲我人所應研究之問題。此地願根據事實，說明最近國際貿易入超之趨向，願國人對於此一重要問題，得一更深切之瞭解。</p>
<p>兩年以來，入超的數値漸趨減少。這是大家所知道的，並且减少的稈度非常迅速。不單入超的絕對値呈迅速的衰退，即相對値亦呈迅速的低落。我們且看如下的事實。（單位千元）</p>
<p>一九三一　一九三三　一九三五</p>
<p>三年來入超數値　八七七、一六八　七三三、一四六　四九四、四五一入超值占總貿易額之百分率　三六·〇％三七·五％三一·六％</p>
<p>第一行表示絕對値，去年的入超較之入超最高記錄的一九三二年，已减少三萬八千萬元實較之一九三三年，亦已减少二萬四千萬元，其數目不可謂不巨了。第二行表示相對數値。我們知道幾年來我國貿易總値是在迅速的衰退中，而入超的衰退更速，特別以去年爲甚。一九三三年入超爲貿易總値之百分之三十七點五，去年只及百分之三十一點六了。這就是表明入超的减退較之貿易總額的减退還要速。</p>
<p>但是上面所說的還是表面的價値，至於眞實的輸出入（即物最的輸出入）如何呢？我們要更淸晳的理解眞實入超的趨向，不能不進而加以分柝。</p>
<p>我們平常所說的貿易額，是指貿易的物値而言，入超額係指入超的數値而言，並不是指物量。物値是物和物量相乘得出來的結果。眞，要明瞭入超的趨勢，不能不剔除物價的變化，以觀眞實物量移出入的狀况。下面言個表，就在剔除物價後觀察物量的變化。把輸出人的物價指數，分別除輸出入數値，結果可以代表物量的趨向。而以物價指數除物値指數，結果即爲物量指數。最後一行，爲以一九二六年爲計算基準之物量出入狀况。所以應標明以一九二六年爲計算基準者，因爲我們所用的是以一九二六年爲基期的指數。</p>
<p>一九三二　一九三二　一九三四</p>
<p>（一）輸入値（單位千元下同）　一、六三、〇七三　一、三四三、六六八　九一九、六六三</p>
<p>（二）輸入物値指數（一九二六爲基期下同）　九三·三　七六·八　五三·一</p>
<p>（三）輸入物指數　一四〇·二　一三二·二　一三二·〇</p>
<p>（四）剔除物價變化後之量數（即以四除一）　一、一六四、八一六　一、〇一五、六二二　七〇四、二九六</p>
<p>（五）輸入物量指數（即以四除二）　六六·六　五八·一　四〇·二</p>
<p>（六）輸出額　七六五、九五六　六一一、八二二　五三五、三二</p>
<p>（七）物値指數　五七·〇　四五·四　三九·八</p>
<p>（八）輸出物價指數　九〇·四　八二·〇　七一·七</p>
<p>（九）剔除物價後之量數（即以八除六）　八四七、一九七　七四六、一二四　七四六、四六〇</p>
<p>（十）輸出物量指數（即以八除七）　七三·一　五五·三　五五·五</p>
<p>（十一）以一二六爲計算基準之物量出入（十）入超（十一）出超　三七、五一九　（十）三六九、四九八　（一）四二、一七〇</p>
<p>這一個表，表現了好幾點重要的事實。第一去年的輸入物價與前年相差無幾，而去年的輸入數値，卻減退特甚，這表明所减退的全是物量。這是很顯明的，物價與物量相乘得物値，物値大形减少而物價不變，足見所變的完全是第三個數，即是物量。第一，去年的出口物量不單不較前年減少，反而較前略有增加，這是可以從輸出物量指數中看出來的。前年的指數爲五十五點三，去年爲五十五點五，反而增多了零點二。然去年的出口數値亦見减少，物量方面旣未見减退，是物値减退的原因，必全由於物價的變化。</p>
<p>這是一個非常可注意的事實。去年的入口方面，物價並未變動，而减少的是入口物量，去年的出口方面，物量並未變動，减少的只是物價，所以剔除物價的變化之後，輸出入物量愈見趨於接近。亦即是說，眞實的物量入超，遠較物値上所表現的爲减。</p>
<p>其次，我們把輸出入物値剔除物價的變化之後加以比較，假如以一九二六年爲計算基準，去年的物量方面，巳經不是入超，而是出超。</p>
<p>所以我們在這裏便得到一個非常重要的結論，即是近來的入超數値漸趨減少，而事實上物量的入超，更見减少。去年貿易値的大形减退，入口方面，全是由於量的减退，至於入口物價，並未見退落，出口方面，减退的原因全是出於輸出物價的低落，至於輸出物量，去年不但未見减少，反而有些微的增加。</p>
<p>爲什應會發生道種現象，我們應該加以說明。去年因銀價上漲關係，我國貨幣無形增値，論理外貨輸入我國，致以我國貨帶算價，其價格必見下落，亦即是輸入物價必見低降，而事實上之所以未見低降者，主要原因，係由於去年各國物價，已逐漸上漲，適足以與在我市塲上的跌價相抵銷，所以去年的輸入物價，可以不再下降。至於入口量的頓見减退，是國民購貿力極度低落的結果，根本便沒有購買的能力，所以造成入口物量的非常的衰退。至於出口方面，出口物量的所以能够不再往下减退，一個原因固在於世界經濟狀况轉現繁榮之象，對我國貨物需要，徵有增加，而另一個原因，則於出口商極力壓低出口物價，以求爭生存於萬一。去年出口物價的非常下落，一個原因即在此點，而另一個原因，却是由於世界各國的貨幣貶値政策使然。蓋因各國貨幣貶値，我國貸物運至外國之後，致以外幣算價，無形中卽已大形漲價，結果無從求售，出口商爲維持其事業計，乃不得不大量壓低出口物價。這是去年出口物價的所以瘋狂下落的最主要一個原因。</p>
<p>上面是對前頭我們所得的結論的解釋。今後的情形怎麽樣呢？這是我們在這篇求應附帶加以推測的。</p>
<p>根據我們分析的結果，年來輸入的减少，全是由於輸入物量的减少，物價方面並無多大的變化。所以即是說年來入超的减少，全在於洋貨輸入數量的减少，其所以致此，則是由於國民沒有購買的能力。我們推測，在相當時期之內，國民的購買能力决無憑空增加之理，因爲就目前的形勢視察，國民經濟是日往破碎的路上走，國民的購買力將見逐日减退是當然的。國民購買力逐日减退，需要洋貨的數量亦將逐日减少，是未來的入口數値有再度往下减少的趨勢。至於出口方面，因世界市塲巳有起色，對我國貨物的需要或反增加，則我國出口的物量，似有隨世界經濟之匡復而再行回漲之望。至於輸出物價，因受各國貨幣政策壓迫之故，暫時要回復上漲，恐不可能。由此，我人旣認輸入有再度減少可能，而輸出似又有回漲之望，則入超額的再趨减少，大是可能的事。</p>
<p>總括言之，年來貿易入超的數値逐日减少，而剔除物價變化後物量的入超，更見减少。去年輸入的减退，全是由於物量的短少，而輸出的减退，則又全是由於物價低落。純物量的入超，事實上遠較數値所表現的入超爲低，並且今後的趨向，入超額有往下再度低落之望，這是我人分析所得的結論。</p>
<p>然而，入超額的减少，並不就是可以樂觀的，我們不要忘記這是國民的窮困壓迫出來的結果。並且我們不要以爲入超減少了，今後的人超便不再成其爲問題。今日國民的負擔能力，已經遠非昔比。今日的入超額雖然减退甚速，而國民的負擔能力的衰退更速。相較之下，國民的入超負荷依然是逐日趨重，入超還是當前的重要問題，並不因數額的减退而失去其重要性。如何解决，依然有待於研究。上而所說的不過是報吿入超的眞實的趨向而已。</p>
<h3 id="c186">發展出口貿易之新途徑 <a href="#c186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>— 孔滌庵</p>
<p>一</p>
<p>近年我國對外貿易，因輸出之銳减，以致入超劇增，現金外流，靡所底止，長此不巳，國民經濟必由萎枯而趨於垂絕無疑，時賢頗有以舉辦輸出信用保險爲發展今後對外貿易相商榷者，茲故略述其梗概如左：</p>
<p>輸出信用保險，爲以填補輸出信用上之危險爲目的之一種特殊制度，詳言之，出口商因收取貨狄而發行之押滙票據（進出口貿易中貨狄之收付，大都由出口商於發裝貨物時，即將該項貨物爲抵押，以受貨人之外國進口商爲付狄人而發行滙票，）如遇其付狄人之外國進口商，陷於倒閉或拒絕承付時，由第三者之保險業對於發票人或貼現銀行，負一定賠欺之謂，而此所謂輸出危險者，析言之，其種類有二：</p>
<p>第一·無力淸價者此中原因，又可分爲破產及非常事變兩種。</p>
<p>（一）由於破產而生之危險，謂之破產危險（BanlruFtcy　rik），多由於買主之破產而起，爲出口商利益計，此種偶發而不可避免之事實，苟無第三者出而設法保障，則對於國際貿易之經營，必有所顧慮而不敢大膽以爲之，故初時輸出信用保險之內容，大都以承保此種危險爲其主要之業務。至何種狀態，始謂之破產，普通法律，均有詳細之規定，祇於保單中載明此種條狄，日後即可依爲解决問題之關鍵。又買主雖未臻破產：而其財政上已瀕絕境，不得不宣吿淸理帳目，以致債欺之全部或一部不能支付時，則可視爲準破產，於保單中訂明要保人得以債權委付（Abandonment）之乎續，轉移於保險業者而取得其賠狄焉。</p>
<p>（二）由於戰亂洪水地震以及政府發布付狄延期令等以致買主之外國進口商不能履行其債務時，謂之非常危險，（Catastropherrik）。此種危險，進口商人苟橫被捲入漩渦，必致無法擺脫，陷於倒閉絕境，轉嫁其損失於出口商無疑。惟所恃乎保險者，雖至屬切要，而普通信用保險公司，對於不可抗事故之發生，例得主張免除其責任，因之承保非常危險是否應由國家之力爲之，遂成問題焉。</p>
<p>第二·拒絕付狄者拒絕付欵之原因，有由貨色惡劣，或到貨過遲，以致買主不願提取者，有由貨價跌落，或銀根奇緊，無法調欵，欲將貨物退還，以致拒絕承兌押滙票據者。其在前者，雖不能作爲締結保險契約之目的：而在後者，除其發生之事由確能歸責於買主外，以危險之豫測，頗不易易，普通多不列入承保之範圍內。</p>
<p>二</p>
<p>從私經濟的觀點立論，在輸出貿易上最有效之方策，自莫若就一般買賣條件中如貨色，貨價，及付狄方法專，一一能副其海外顧客之希望，而較優於其他競爭者，誠能如此，則不待招徠，人將爭往問津以期其交易之成功矣。顧貨色貨價之是否能較優較廉，恒爲種種條件所支配，斷非一朝一夕所易能達到。惟付欵方法之如何，則可以人爲乎段，使設法改變。如貨狄之淸償，夙爲短期者，今易以長期，或押匯跟單（DocumentaryBills）。向須買主將貨欵支付後交與之所謂付狄交（Documentsagain）stpayment）（簡稱Dp（者，今易以承兌交付（Documentsagainstacceptance）（簡稱DA），買主祇須承諾日後支付票面所開金額，即交與之，俾貨物提取到乎後，一而從事脫售入一面冉歸還貨欵，因無臨時張羅購貨資金之不便，又誰不願購入其貨品而樂爲之推銷。然遵斯行之，姑母論出口商資本有限，無力爲此長期賒賣，自其所負之風險甚大。設買主在此期間中因遭遇他故，致宣吿歇業，或竟藉口他故，延不淸償，以營利爲目的之貿易商，誰能堪此。此就出口商方面以言，輸出信用保險之重要如此。（未完）</p>

<h3 id="c193">論詩 <a href="#c193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>— 江寄萍</p>
<p>隨園詩話中談到詩要曲，所謂曲也就是王國維的「不格」的說法，但我的意見以為做詩不妨多管閒事，不妨發痴，如「夜來風雨聲，花落知多少」便是多管閒事，然而管得好，又如陳楚南題背面美人圖云：</p>
<p>「美人背倚玉閩干，惆恨花容一見難；幾度喚他他不轉，痴心欲掉畫圖看。」</p>
<p>其好處就在明知是畫，而偏要掉過來看。這便是發痴，然而這痴却是詩意的痴。</p>
<p>隨園詩話有一節論詩之曲的，很可啓發人之性靈。他說「或問詩如何而後謂之曲？余曰：「古詩之曲者，不勝數可矣。卽如近人王仔園訪友云：「亂烏棲定夜三更，樓上銀燈一點明；記得到門遠不扣，花陰悄聽讀書聲。」此曲也。若到門便扣，則直矣。方蒙章訪友云：「輕舟一路繞烟霞，更愛山前滿澗花，不為尋君也留住，那知花裏即君家？」此曲也。若便知是　君家，直矣。宋人詠梅云：「綠楊解　語應相笑，漏洩春光恰是誰？」詠紅　梅云：「牧童睡起朦朧眼，錯認桃林　欲放牛。」詠梅而想到楊柳之心，牧童之眼，此曲也。若專詠梅花，便直　矣。」</p>
<p>所謂曲，也就是在詩中別有一番好境，是別人所想不到的。就彷彿林盡水源，前路已被山遮住，像是「此路不通」了，可是忽然一轉身，繞過這山去，那邊又豁然開朗，另有許多美景，一眼看不過來。這時讀詩的人，便自然的頒受了一種快哉。這也就是所謂「不格」，所謂「曲」所謂「有神韻」，所謂「性靈」，所謂「幽默」，怎樣稱之，都無不可。好詩是沒有什麼分別的，新詩也好，舊詩也好，批評詩的總離不開以上這幾種說法。</p>
<p>詩這種東西，是應當有感而作的，如果有人出題目，一定沒有佳作，我們翻開唐詩來看看，應制之詩可有一首是好的？袁子才云：「無題之詩，天籟也，有題之詩，人籟也：天籟易功，人籟難工。三百篇古詩十九首，皆無題之作，後人取其詩中首面之一二字為題，遂獨絕千古。漢魏以下，有題方有詩，性情漸漓。至唐人有五言八韻之試帖，限以格律，而性情愈遠。」所謂無題而有詩，一定是情感極登富的時候，這樣寫出來的詩，一定是性靈的作品，我以為作詩正如交朋友，兩個好朋友聚在一起，促膝長談，傾吐肺腑，覺得彼此說的話一言一句，非常動聽，且每句話都帶着豐富的感情，就是談到深夜，也略無倦容，我們有所感觸的時候作詩也是這樣子。有時在冬夜醒來，聽得外面幾聲凄淸的梆子饗，或在一個春天的淸晨，看見河堤上的柳條，被風吹一擺搖，忽然心裏一動，立刻胸中的詩句彷彿像滾滾的河水要流出堤來，不傾吐一下，實在不快，這便是性靈到來的時候。若無感觸而作詩，正如敷衍一個討厭的朋友，越討厭，便越覺得沒有話說，卽是能說幾句話，也是不關痛癢的敷衍話，彼此都感覺枯燥乏味，恨不得趕緊離開遠遠的。苦吟便是這樣，伏案握筆，不得半句，繞壁翻書，亦無所得，這樣作詩，實在人生的惡刑。唐代著名的苦吟詩人賈島有句云：</p>
<p>「二句三年得，一吟雙淚流；知音若</p>
<p>不賞，歸臥故山秋。」</p>
<p>這他先把作詩的目的看錯了，古人說「詩言志」，所謂「言志」也就是抒發自己的情感，說自己要說的話，他人之賞不賞，是他人的事，與我有何干—為他人之賞識，而不肯說自己的話，便是摧殘性靈，便一定沒有佳句，不怪他要「二句三年得」了。試觀古人之詩能獨抒己見者，都有他自己的個性，不是人云亦云。其實事情是早已陳腐不堪的事了，而經過他的筆一描寫，表示出他獨有的意見，却能光景常新這便能說自己的話的好處。如李白詩「若敎管仲身常在，宮內何妨更六人！」楊誠齋詩云；「但願君王誅宰嚭，不愁宮裏有西施。」唐人詠明皇云：「姚宋不亡妃子在，胡塵那得到中華！」僖宗幸蜀詩云：「地下阿瞞應有語，這回休更怨楊妃。」范同叔詩云：「吳國若敎丞相在，越王空送美人來。」唐人有詩云：「吳王事事都　倒，未必西施勝六宮。」這種詩都是有自己的見解，不依傍古人，所以新穎異常。有的人雖然明明有這種意見，却不敢說，那還是不肯說自己的話。</p>
<h3 id="c194">航船夜話 <a href="#c194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>— 唐錫如</p>
<p>我從無錫趁了最末一班的輪船回家。聽說明天便沒有了，河裏水太淺。不單是沿路的農民反對輪船的行駛，（這很容易使龍骨車受傷，）就是那貪小利的小輪船主人，也主張停班了。因為即使船是開的慢車，慢得有如蝸牛那樣爬，不過仍舊要時時小心河底裹有什麽石塊，會把船底咬掉一塊的，</p>
<p>從日出到日落，纔算捱到了和橋。這兒到我的家，還有二十多里水路，輪船不經過這條路，所以我得另外雇航船。</p>
<p>這次回去，是父親從家鄉雇了船來接的。所以省掉許多麻煩。我在細雨中走過輪船的跳板，又踏上了航船的跳板，教船家上岸去買了一些麵與粥之類來充飢後，船立刻又在濃黑的夜色裏出發了。</p>
<p>我有七八年沒回去了，所以父親忙着吿訴，我家鄉這些年來的變遷。什麽人死掉了，什麽人抽上鴉片了，什麼店家倒閉了。什麽人入了靑　　，而且做了首領，竟有二三百個徒弟，在地方上橫行了。全是瑣屑的消息，灰色的消息，使人詫異而又氣悶的消息。</p>
<p>船搖出和橋鎭不上三里路，船窗邊立刻熱鬧起來，光亮起來。火把，保險燈，燈龍。兩邊岸上繁多得像星星似的。抽水機的喘息聲，龍骨車的乾號聲，農夫的吆喊，村狗的狂吠，還有那憧憧往來的人影，合起來譜成一首使人煩躁得想自殺的音樂，構成一幅使人看了要下淚的圖畫，他們愈是出死力的掙扎，愈是現出他們的偉大，而同時他們又是何等悲苦和可憐啊！</p>
<p>燈光淡卜去了，聲音也淡卜去了。我們已經來到本地有名的大河。這裹的鄉民，似乎全憑這絛大河的恩賜，現在還可以在夜裏休息，四週是寂寂的，月光出來了。照見一叢叢的樹影，一塊槐的屋影在疲乏地睡着。要不是有剛才碰到的惡麥似的現實，這兒該是最理想的一首抒悄詩似的月夜景色了。可是……。</p>
<p>「死鬼！睡着了嗎？撐到河當中去！你要擱在淺灘上去嗎？一後梢有一個人在大聲叱駡，同時船頭上有竹篙戳到水裏去的聲音。</p>
<p>這樣聽了多時的疲倦的咿啞咿啞的櫓聲，幾乎要睡着了。</p>
<p>忽的，父親往窗口探了一探，把烟筒往窗檻上除淸了烟渣，爽一爽喉嚨，說「快到了！讓我們到船頭上淸醒一下去。」</p>
<p>我們走到船頭上坐下，忽的父親低低地對我說：「那………就是前面那口，左邊河灘上，有一口白皮棺材，就是那個給流氓打死的巡官：……是騙他出去捉賭打死了的，……眞可惜！年紀還不滿二十八歲呢……」</p>
<p>說了，父親站起來，把背朝着左邊，喃喃的說了兩句「冤有頭，債有主」的話，立刻又爽了一下喉嚨，故意乾咳幾聲，大聲的對船家搭赸：</p>
<p>「金龍，西南角上有幾塊鳥雲呢！明天會來一次陣頭雨罷。」</p>
<p>「但願這樣就好了，阿彌陀佛！老天爺要是再不開恩，窮人便沒飯吃了！」</p>

<p>— 艾蕪</p>
<p>「息息吧，大家息息吧！……天這樣熱！」</p>
<p>被同伴叫做秦老板的停下足，喘一口氣，一邊提起右足來，鬆一　給草鞋絆結勒痛了的地方，一邊向走到坡那面的人，焦燥地大聲喊着。　　　老徐，挑着一擔洋線洋針之類的雜貨的，就立刻站着，措一揩額上的汗，說道：</p>
<p>「好，等一等他吧！」</p>
<p>「不要管他，讀他吃一點苦頭！……他在這裏擺大老板的架子嘛！……走走。」</p>
<p>老陳掉轉頭來這麽說着，同時把墜在背上的藍布包袱聳了一下，便仍舊向前走着。</p>
<p>老徐笑了一笑，同意了，就將壓在左邊肩頭的担子，移放在左邊，跟着尾上前去。</p>
<p>秦老板見坡那面沒人答允，暗自想道：這兩個傢伙就不等我了麽？欲待一屁股坐下去休息自家的，但早上動身一直到現在，還不曾看見一所人家，而這裏的山坡，又全是一望的矮緣樹叢，靜悄悄的，好像走進了原始的山林一般。便禁不住害怕起來，只得忍着足痛朝前走去。</p>
<p>季候是亞熱帶的春天了。坡頭和壕裏的雜色樹木，都在長年不變的濃綠中，抽着新芽，發散出淸淡的苦味和香氣。沿途的葉上，浮閃着點點金燦的陽光。沒有風吹來，到處悶着熱。</p>
<p>轉過坡去，望見兩人緩緩走動的背了，秦老敎又呌了起來：</p>
<p>「喂，你兩位不覺得重麽？…天又這樣熱！……我空平還不打緊！」</p>
<p>「還好！還好！」</p>
<p>老陳翻過頭來，高聲回答着，隨即掉轉去，仍舊走他的，一面快意地笑着，低聲向老徐說道：</p>
<p>「媽媽的，他還不打緊哩！看嘛！」</p>
<p>「徐大哥，你也不息息麽？…只顧趕路會發悶心痧的！挑那樣重的担子。」</p>
<p>秦老板便單獨向老徐勸駕。老陳就小聲說道：</p>
<p>「你看，他在向你討好了，不要　他的。他眼裏全把我們看成下苦人，呸！」</p>
<p>老徐覺得不理別人，是不對的，但要順從地停下來，又不願意，就把肩上的担子移了一移，高聲回答道：</p>
<p>「秦老板，走　走再息吧，這裹又沒水喝！」　　老陳諷刺地小聲笑道：</p>
<p>「你才愛叫他老板哩！……什麽老板？簡直靠不住！」</p>
<h3 id="c196">塔上塔下 <a href="#c196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>— 奔水</p>
<p>隨着距離的逼近，錫山塔　在我們的眼前大起來了。</p>
<p>我們循着那縈迥的石級上了山，上了寺。循着那古老的，幽暗的梯級上了塔，上了塔頂</p>
<p>隨着梯級的升高，風也就大起來。山頂上的一棵草，一株樹，都在動。</p>
<p>我用二支眼望着底下，望着一切。我知道全城是那麼大，那麼寬廣，可是在現在都奔入了我的眼底。我能數得淸這所那所的建築物。我知道惠山頂上的一株草，太湖中的一掀波，山徑上的一行人，馬路上的一輛車，都在動，都在動。可是，在我的眼下，他們都成了凝固的東西。</p>
<p>我看着許多山像許多墳，看着太湖像一個池，看着膚六尺高的人像個小人國裏的孩子，看着車馬像件玩具。</p>
<p>「呵，呵，他們都在我的眼底渺小了。」</p>
<p>我又知道我們現在所處的社會是一座塔，而我是在塔頂，那麽無疑的我便是這座塔的主宰了。呵，呵，千萬人都在我的脚下，我的脚下！我用腳蹴在水門汀的地上，錚錚然。</p>
<p>隨手將一支殘餘的燜尾丟將下去，它便像醉漢般踉　地隨風　滾着，很久才着地。</p>
<p>隨口噴出一點唾沫，它也是踉　地滾下去。</p>
<p>一啊，塔頂上的一支烟尾，一點唾沬，也偉大起來了」</p>
<p>我的臉上發着光。</p>
<p>暮色把我們催下塔來，我們又踏上那榮迥的石級了。我知道這時塔上的人們看着我們是渺小的；但我回首望望那剩留在塔上的人，我也覺得他們渺小了。不，運那塔的本身我也覺得渺小。不，連那錫山，根本找也覺得渺小了。</p>
<p>我的心頭堆上無名的悵惘。</p>
<p>隨着距離的增大，錫山塔便在我們的視綫中消失。</p>

<p>— （美國J．T．法來耳作）宜閑譯</p>
<p>—美國生活素描—</p>
<p>太克司·費樂司本是希臘的山鄉裏一個强壯的牧童。他那辛苦操作的母親積受了一些錢，夠　做着盤用到美國去，那個國度裹，據大家說，金子舖着街路，有着一般的大建築，女的提穿得像公主一般，男的袋子異滿是錢，個個男孩子有一部脚踏車，個個男人和女人備一部汽車，而且所有的房子都好像王宮一般。太克司身材生得長大，十三歲上，看去不止這點年紀的他就到這天國名叫支加哥的一個城市了。</p>
<p>他這驚慌失措的孩子坐在火車上，有一個親戚到車上來接。這親戚把他帶到南霍司推特街的家裏，便呌他進一家糖菓店做生意。不多久，太克司發見了天國生活的意義。這就是從早上六點鐘一直工作到晚上六點鐘，星期六和星期日再遲些。這就是打掃店堂，洗碗碟，揩門　，擦器具，收拾東西，出差。這就是他眼睛　不起來的時候，上夜校讀英文，時時給人家笑他不長進。這就是在齷齪的街市當中走着，住着，時刻有煤氣，灰塵，烟煤和汽車裏放出來的惡氣味撲上他的鼻管來，惹得他咳嗆。這就是每逢想念着他那希臘山間的故鄉，想念着他的母親，想念着牧羊的清閒日子，不由得引起深深的寂寞來。</p>
<p>太克司進店後，有許多日子一直是很沈靜的孩子。他老是回想着自己的故鄉和跟別的孩子們玩過的遊戲，回想着那老母親的微笑和接吻。他怕着美國的一切，怕着支加哥的　雜的天國生活。他天天耐着心工作，每星期縣五塊洋錢，從這上頭省出一點來，存在一家移民的銀行。然而他却指望着，總啊一天，他會變得活像美國人，會講着同他們一樣的話，會穿着他們穿的衣服，會照他們的樣坐着汽車，會帶着美國女郎出去。</p>
<p>漸漸兒，太克司學會了種種的乖。他學會了美國話，只是學不會怎樣講得同美國人一樣。他知道了自己是不成樣子的希臘土佬兒，許多美國人都不見得要他和他的許多同鄉到美國來。他知道了美國女郎是談笑着年靑的希臘土佬兒的。而且，他又知道了幾塊地方，他化兩塊錢就可以到那裏去找那些不會笑希會土佬兄的美國女郎，至少有五分錡或是十分錡可以白相。他知道了趁什麽時候可以買便宜的美國人穿的衣服，知道了紫色的綢襯衫和紫色的短襪怎麽穿，橘黃色的領帶怎麽打結。漸漸兒，他又知道了在店裹他可以把放到收錢機去的錢塞些到自己的袋子裏。</p>
<p>到後來，雇用着他的那個親戚一光火，就辭退了他，駡他賊骨頭，沒良心的東西。太克司有些不服氣，回嘴說，他　着這種壞貨色，賺了很多錢，要人家老實，怎麼只給人家六塊錢一星期的工錢呢。</p>
<p>太克司後來有別的同鄉們雇川他，在水菓店，冷飲室，酒排間，和菜館做生意。他史加慌得了些美國世情，和美國的話。有時候，他穿了紫色綢襯衫和相稱的短襪，打了橘紅領結，不是在公園里，便是沿着南霍司推特　散散步，一面看看美國的女郎，恨不得有一個美麗的粉紅膚色的碧眼女郎，歸給他自己。有時候，他想念着他的希臘的山鄉，他夢想着回到那裏去，隨帶美國的洋錢，還隨帶一個女郎，也許就是這些紅膚色的年靑美麗的美國女郎中閒的一個。</p>
<p>太克司混過了多年的光陰，他是二十多歲的靑年了，還帶着他那最初的居留護照。他一向狗也似的工作着，他依然幹着他到美國老幹着的那些雜差。他每星期　十五塊洋錢，在糖菓店裏每天工作十二小時。他打掃着，揩拭着，洗擦着，收拾着，伺候着買賣，每逢他一幹于在店裏的時候，他就從收錢機落些錢。每星期，他到銀行裏儲蓄一次，他幾乎每夜看一看他的銀行褶子，見儲蓄多起來，心裏很得意，然而他總不能把錢積受得怎麽多，因為他常常免不了歇生意，那就不得不靠他的儲蓄來過活，處到有新的生意為止。</p>

<h3 id="c198">蛋黃素戒烟問題（類脂肪體戒烟問題）（二） <a href="#c198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>— 龐京周</p>
<p>蛋黃素戒烟法怎樣出而問世？</p>
<p>馬文照君以蛋黃素戒烟的原理和經過。已如上述，自此之後，南京方面戒烟醫院中自然採月，而同時馬君又曾作第三次細胞變態的研究。來答解各細胞丙高基氏器所需要的類脂質，是否與血小板增加有關及白血球如何輸送類脂質等諸問題，他仍用白鼠來試騐所得結果，大要如下。</p>
<p>（甲）嗎啡有刺激紅血球產生多量小血板之可能，上面已經說過，而血小板重</p>
<p>要成分乃是類脂質。</p>
<p>（乙）在解癮期內，血小板增多之後，白血球體內的類脂質也增加，並見血小板在無核白血球的體內，而血管中的白血球大减，各器官中的白血球大增，由此知道白血球係在血行中含帶多量類脂質，或血小板，運輸至各器官，以供改造高基氏器的情形。</p>
<p>（丙）在犯癮期間，血小板之數大减，白血球旣無所吸取，故發見停滯於血管之中者甚多，似有待機吸取類脂質之狀，同時各器官中白血球大减，高基氏器亦减少，甚或消失。</p>
<p>（丁）飼食蛋黃素後，白血球卽於腸壁吸收此項類脂質，以供需要，不必勞紅血球之產生多量血小板，故發見滯留於血管中者减少，而在器官中者又復大增。</p>
<p>這一項研究的報告，詳載在一九三三年中華生理雜誌第七卷第四期二八七—至—三四二頁，題爲「白鼠長期中嗎非癮及治療時白血球之改變」，</p>
<p>去年南京開遠東熱帶病學會的時候，馬君又與南京市立戒烟醫院兩位醫師，同發表一篇論文，載在該會彙刋第二集裏面，題目是「服用蛋黃素係舒適而自然之戒鴉片法」，（AcomfortableandspcontaneouecureofopiumhabitbyMeansofalecithindiet）</p>
<p>據這一篇臨床實騐的報告，說服用大量蛋黃素有槍上戒烟，令吸奢自己戒絕的可能，並有精神愉快，體重增加，大便通暢，睡眠安定，胃納旺盛，姻容驟减，從不發癮，自然少吸等八大功效，觀夫以上兩篇文字，就可知道研究者至去年對於蛋黃素認爲相當滿意，因此衛生署遂於去冬發售「新生牌蛋黃素」的製品到江浙一帶，論衛署發行初意，也是爲提倡普及戒烟起見，所以連製品的品名，加上新生字樣，表示與新生活相符，然而在發行手續上缺少了幾個步驟，以致使用方法，與馬君實騐的條件也不盡合，造成了今日市上烏烟瘴氣的讕言，纏七搭八的批評，茲分述他的來源如左</p>
<p>（甲）按馬君等在市立醫院的實騐，是用四十個法院送交的烟犯爲標準，與普通家居吸烟者環境精神皆有不同。</p>
<p>（乙）馬君等的實騐係以醫院爲背景，戒烟手續，服用蛋黃素方法，皆在醫師支配之下，並詳細診查其經過，同時以他種藥物爲烟犯冶病，</p>
<p>（丙）馬君等原文申述此項戒烟法之奏效，仍根據他細胞學上的研究，並未包羅一切鴉片作用，皆可以蛋黃素解除之。</p>
<p>（了）馬君等在論文結語，希望其他醫案與醫院作擴大的實騐，並請同道加以研究批評，（未完）</p>

<p>— 司徒學</p>
<p>美國之學校齒科管理法，種類雖甚多，大約可分爲州立市立或社會團體，或財團經營等。至於學校齒科之設施，如波斯頓之Forsyth兒童診療院，及Rochester市之Rochestet齒科病院，爲中央治療所中之最偉大最理想之代表。而其他都市，亦有中央式治療所之設施。Bidgeport市則設於市立會館內，且於市內三十餘小學校內，亦設置簡單之齒科治療所，其他普通多爲學務局，衛生局，赤十字會，結核豫防協會等所管理</p>
<p>都會之學校齒科設施，管理略如上述。至於鄉間，因不易設置中央治療所，則組織巡迴齒科治療班。此巡迴班，亦採用種種方式，簡單者僅携帶摺疊式之椅子及手用器械往診，遠處則利用汽車或馬車，設一簡單之治療室於其內，巡迴往診，甚爲便利。</p>
<p>法國之口腔衛生運動</p>
<p>法國之口腔衛生設施，始於一九〇八年三月二十三日，據社會敎育局公布之法令，凡小學及師範學校之學生，均須施行口腔檢查及治療。此法令公布後，乃委任齒科醫二名，擔任檢查與治療之任務，每年施行口腔檢查二次，將被檢查者之口腔狀態，填入檢查證，寄示其家長，唯治療與否，任其自便。當時尙未有學校治療所之設施，故欲治療者，大抵就合意之私人齒科醫院治療之，惟治療醫不受診查醫之拘束，而診查醫不過檢查學童之口腔狀態而已。</p>
<p>在此法令未公布之前，法國之齒科醫界，對於口腔衛生運動，雖具有推進之熟忱，但因敎育界當局漠不關心，故其發展亦不如英美德諸國之進步。彼時對於小學兒童之口腔衛生，多未深加注意，唯中學以上之學生，間有施行者而已。及至一九〇八年，此法令頒布後，乃於校醫之規定職務上，追加關於齒牙一項，命校醫將診查各學生之口腔狀態，須填入精密之表記，並對於將來任職敎育界或師範學校之學生，依法律上所規定，一年須受兩次口腔診查，並勸告其治療，當時對於口腔衛生之工作，如此而已，實未有何貢獻也。其後經過二年，師範學校以外之中學，亦漸次規定檢查。至於小學兒童，仍未見法律上有何規定。及至下議院提出小學兒童應施行口腔診查之法案後，乃漸實現焉。</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>一九一二年Nice市等，開始創辦市立學校齒科治療所，而巴黎及其他大都市之慈善團體，成齒科醫會，齒科學校等，亦相繼創立，以作義務報効。</p>
<p>法國口腔衛生協會，創立於一九一一年，其目的（一）使民衆知口腔衛生之重要，非僅保存齒牙健全，且於個人身體健康上有重要之關係，及種族之發達與否，亦受其支配。（二）藉演講幻燈等，以普及民衆之口腔衛生敎育。（三）以期學校軍隊及各慈善機關內實行口腔診査與治療等。此齒科衛生協會之會員，不僅為齒科醫師，並網羅議員，新聞記者，敎育界等智識階級，協力共謀發展，故法國之口腔衛生，日見進步也。</p>

<p>— 李與</p>
<p>平常無病的月經也有些痛，不過不是忍不住的痛。此處所講的是異常的痛。治療經痛一可用熱力，如用熱濕塾敷與熱飲類。其次鎭靜神經與止痛藥品可用。通大便，平素實行個人衛生也可减少經痛。有時亦需外科改正子宮位置。</p>
<p>腰痛Lumbago</p>
<p>腰痛不是稀奇的痛。報紙上也可看見大登特登治腰痛的廣吿。賈膏藥的一大批銷路也是賴着腰痛的顧客。普通治療腰痛的方法多是不合病理所以也不免多是緣木求魚。怎麼樣呢？腰痛是一種最複雜的毛病。由多年來的研究已知腰痛的原因不下一百二十種。若是各種腰痛都用一樣的治法當然不能得到好效騐。茲因限於篇幅不能一一述說腰痛的原因。茲略述最緊要原因於下：現在從皮外向內講；腰部肌肉發炎可以呌人有腰痛。這種發炎多由口鼻喉部慢性發炎病而來。由肌肉再向內有骨頭，脊骨，盆骨有毛病了也呌人有腰痛。脊骨癆與普通發炎也是腰痛的原因。脊柱是集二十多活動小骨節而成下端又與盆骨成微活動的骨節。這些骨節負上半身之重時時運動，並且又易受意外傷害；例如，懷孕與生產時特別受傷。多生子女的婦女腰痛也越多。兩腿若長短不等或大腿節不正使脊柱一邊受累較重於別的一邊也是腰痛的原因。脊柱之內面或腎外生瘡平常人也以為是腰痛。</p>
<p>婦女們腰痛，最普通的原因是骨盆內器官的毛病。例如，子宮炎，子宮位置不正，卵巢炎，輸卵管炎，骨盆內組織生膿，子宮生瘤，卵巢生瘤等。所以治療婦女們腰痛必須先明白這種病理。假設腰痛了就在背後貼幾張膏藥豈不是緣木求魚麽？</p>
<p>腎（俗稱腰子）毛病也是腰痛的一種原因；例如，腎炎，腎生石，腎癆病，腎生瘤，腎游動等。其次一個人腹部特別肥胖也多有腰痛。第三期的梅毒長在脊骨上也呌人腰痛。</p>
<p>由此可見治療腰痛不是根簡單的事。治療腰痛的醫師必須有充分內科的知識，他也必須精外科，骨科，婦科等。病家若有了醫學常識也可不上人的當。</p>
<p>有幾點是治療腰痛的標準，務須注意。不是有了腰痛祇曉貼膏藥或服藥丸。第一要曉得是不是脊骨或脊骨節或盆骨節發炎。假設査明是以上的原因，治療須休息身體，用熱力，扶托，除去病根。如係骨癆須照治療骨癆方法行。第二，婦女腰痛務注意及子宮病，或生瘤，或骨盆內有毛病，均非貼膏藥與服腎藥丸所可濟事。必須用外科或婦科方法除掉毛病然後才能洽好腰痛。</p>
<p>第三，特別宜注意的是腎病。平常人每誤以任何腰痛為「腰子」病。平常人常以為腰下部痛是由腎病發生的。其實腎是在腰部之上部並不是在腰之下部。腎有毛病固然是腰痛的一種原因，但不是一切腰痛都是由腎病而來。使腰痛的腎病也有好幾種，例如，腎生石，腎癆都非藥丸所可了事。就是普通腎炎也不是像廣吿上治療之簡單。</p>
<p>其次特別肥胖的人宜少使腰受累。兩腿長短不等的穿一隻高底鞋使腰部平衡。</p>
<p>急性副睪炎</p>
<p>有淋病的常發生副睪丸炎，其原因為淋病菌由尿道經輸精管達到副睪丸致起急性發炎。同時睪丸亦腫大。急性的副睪丸炎與睪丸炎是很疼痛的毛病。有些基本原理若是明白丁，一可預防副　丸炎，二可减少副睪丸炎與睪丸炎的痛苦。預防這種毛病並不</p>
<p>預防這種毛病並不是特別難事，祇要明白了病理就可以辦得到。第一，有淋病的人如用藥水洗尿道或施行任何種手術務須輕輕的舉行。第二務勿使睪丸受傷。第三，有淋病的人就是畢丸沒有一點毛病也須時時帶陰囊布托（或鬆緊托）。這樣雖不可絕對免除副畢丸與畢丸炎但可以免去十之八九。</p>
<p>止急性副睪丸與畢丸炎的痛量要緊的不是麻醉品北痛。最要緊的是：（一）身體臥床休息。（二）將腫痛的陰囊托起，最好托起使完全不能動，膠布做的托為最宜。（三）局部用熱或用冷均可减少疼痛（冷較好於熟）。止痛的藥糊也有一點益處。（四）必須時時服用或注射止痛藥一次至數次也很合理。</p>
<p>心痛</p>
<p>我們在講心痛前可先講講心的位置。若是不曉得心在什麼地方我們也不容易曉得心痛是什麽。俗語講，『把良心擺在正當中』。講起來良心應當在正當中但心却不在胸的正當中。心的位置是在：胸之前，上達第三肋軟骨卽第二肋間隙下。下達中間第七肋軟骨，左右達第五肋間隙。心下部左邊向左距中綫約三吋半，在左乳頭內一吋半。右邊距中綫約二吋，故心之位置是在胸中部略偏向左邊，而不在正中心。</p>
<p>知道了心的地位有心痛時就容易曉得所有的痛是不是心痛。心痛治療心痛就有好效騐，不是心痛當為心痛治當然不會有好結果。</p>
<p>要明白心痛也須明白心的構造與病理。茲略述於下。心的外面有兩層雙摺的薄膜將心完全包住，此膜名為心包膜。為包膜有時發炎稱為心包膜炎。這種心痛常在心前面的胸部。痛有的像刀刺，有的悶痛。有時這種痛也反射到腹部。務勿誤以為腹病。</p>
<p>心包膜旣是雙層有時心包膜炎在這兩層當中生出液體使病者覺到心悶痛。止這種痛須將這種液體抽出機以休息。</p>
<p>心包膜內是心肌肉。心肌肉炎名為心肌炎。心肌炎常有心痛。慢性心肌炎常是慢性痛。這種痛常起於用力或心受激刺時。痛在胸骨之上部，或在胸左邊上部，或在心前之胸部，或反射到左肩左臂左手，或左下牙牀之角處。很少時候反射到身體之右邊。心肌炎痛有輕有重，輕的不過覺到心悶，重的就是疼痛難忍，好像是心被擠在鐵匠的螺旋挾中間被扭轉挾緊起來一樣。同時胸部覺到縮緊大有死亡臨身之勢。痛常發現在飯後，大概是因飯後血多聚在腸胃處心肌肉感受貧血。病人除在心肌炎末期外少有在休息時或睡眠時發生疼痛的。病輕的愈後常有幾個月不發，病重的痛的次數也多，不痛的時期也少。痛來時病人立時卽須停止行動，痛也常於數分鐘內過去。有時痛達到極點病者立時死亡。有的死於心臟久經疼痛精疲力竭之後。</p>
<p>止這種的心痛，當痛來時吸亞硝酸澱粉立時就可止痛。但根本治療還須除去病根與休息。除病根例如，根治瘋濕痛，局部病根，梅毒（第三期梅毒），血壓高，腎炎等病。</p>
<h3 id="c203">肺結核淺說（四八） <a href="#c203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>— 胡嘉言</p>
<p>第十章　肺結核症的預後</p>
<p>病者的年齡，和預後方面也是狠有關係的。一二歲以內的乳兒，最為危險，差不多是個個陷於不治的；但患本病的數計，實較成人為少。在剛過靑春期的少年（十六歲以上），也是特殊危險的。自此一直到三十歲左右，都屬於危險期範圍以內。從三十五歲到五十歲以上，則本病大半為慢性型式，預後亦較良。但在五十四五歲以上，因體力之消耗，本病再成惡性，結果多危及生命，所謂老年性結核是。在三歲以上，靑春期以下的本病，預後均大抵較良。</p>
<p>病者的性格，也是人人不同，各有其特點的；結果也會影響到病症本身的。有些人是極易感應的，他們對於本症，素來就抱着談虎色變的態度；不知道本症的嚴重和輕微，是大有出入的。像早期浸潤的型式，祇須療治得當，係大半能轉愈的；但因患者過分膽怯神經過敏的關係，影響於前途是很大的。有些人是意志非常堅强，處處抱着人定勝天的態度，以謂不足憂慮的。但在嚴重的時侯，像高熱是應該决對眠息的，空洞是應該專門療治等情，他有時會置若罔聞的；結果之日趨於惡劣，那是不言而喻了！</p>
<p>患者之治療方針得當與否？以及長期療養之是否屐行？對於預後方面之情形，係大有出入的。我們可以大膽地說一句，就是：正當的治療愈早，前途的希望也是愈大的。至於住處攝生之得宜，營養之適當，以及病者環境如何等種種：都和病症前途有莫大之關係，决不能當作具文的。</p>
<p>末後，患者的經濟狀况，對於病症前途，係有絕大權威的。有許多的本症，起初狀况並非萬分惡劣，但是廢棄職業，長期療治，是病者事實上所辦不到的；結果日趨於惡劣，以致不治；這一種例子，恐怕是數不勝數的。但這是國家社會整個的問題，當然不是開業醫師和私人醫院所可單獨擔任的了！　（本章完）</p>

<p>（四十四）耳鳴</p>
<p>我們的耳器官。遇着外界有音波振動的時候。立卽可由攝音的機能。而發生聽覺。若外界沒有音波振動的時候。那就聽覺也就不會發生這是當然的道理。但是有的時候。外界並沒有什麽音波的振動。自己確可聽得一種聲音。是卽所謂耳鳴。一般俗間以為耳鳴是體弱氣虛的徵象。這種的解釋。未免過於渺茫。我們如果從耳科學上確實的講起來。耳鳴實因聽神經發生異常的興奮而來的一種聽感覺。這種聽感覺祇有自已覺得。他人是不覺得的。所以耳鳴又稱自覺的聽覺。耳鳴多隨聽器的病象而發。醫如在急性中耳加答兒，慢性中耳加答兒，急性化膿性中耳炎，慢性化膿性中耳炎，耳硬化症，迷路貧血，迷路充血，各種中毒，及內耳炎等等時候。耳鳴常為一種必發的症候。耳鳴的音調，種類，强弱，持續，及痛苦等等。亦各有不同。現在大略一述如左。</p>
<p>（一）耳鳴的音調　耳鳴的音調。千變萬化。有低調，高調，調和的，不調和的，淸音，及雜音等等區別。</p>
<p>（二）耳鳴的種類　由耳鳴的聲音性狀常可別為蜂鳴，蟬鳴，蟲鳴，風聲，鐘聲，笛聲，水泡聲，沸水音，波音，及鈴響等等。</p>
<p>（三）耳鳴的强弱　在心境暢悅，精神爽快，天氣晴朗，操勞適度，及月經正常等時候。耳鳴的程度常弱。在忿怒煩惱，心境惡劣，精神衰憊，氣候變化，操勞過度，月經異常，生殖器障碍，及姙娠等時候。耳鳴的程度常强。</p>
<p>（四）耳鳴的持續　耳鳴的持續有三。卽發作性，間斷性，及持續性。其中要以持續性耳鳴的預後。較為不良。</p>
<p>（五）耳鳴的痛苦　耳鳴的痛苦。第一是妨碍聽覺。第二是易起煩惱。第三是悮認聲音。耳鳴程度劇烈的時侯。常可令人不能從事於職務的工作。或者妨碍睡眠。甚或不耐痛苦而致自殺。</p>

<h3 id="c205">爆竹呢？炸彈呢？ <a href="#c205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>— 龍</p>
<p>二十日國民社倫敦電，德國對於國聯議决的抗議書，已向國聯行政院十四國同時提出，其措詞與外問預測者大相懸殊，政府中人稱，「此非炸彈，實一爆竹耳，」爆竹和炸彈，其爆裂性的强弱，天然有霄壤的差別，德國的抗議書，果為爆竹呢，還是炸彈？倒也有一談的價値。</p>
<p>凡事，傍觀者淸，當局者昧，在當局者用盡心機，鈎心鬥角，極操縱運用的能事，然而在傍觀者視之，殊不値一哂。國聯的議决案，在國聯視之，自為對於德國所投的巨大炸彈，然而在德國人視之，不啻一爆竹，德國的抗議書，雖吾人未經見其原文，但卽據倫敦電稱，照會內容，係反對國聯决議之直捷了當抗議書，其措辭雖屬强硬，但有節制。就這寥寥數語觀之，已足見德國的抗議書，實係炸彈而非迎神賽會所放的爆竹可比。</p>
<p>在德國的意思，你們十四國議决儘管議决，我們德國絕不承認，看你們還有什麽辦法？何容多說。在這樣一來，國聯的議决案，已等於廢紙，其抗議書的嚴重性，已可概見。而英人則態度從容，輕揮羽扇曰：「這是爆竹而非炸彈，」其中原有不得已的苦衷，英國對於德國的立傷，自與法意兩國有別，英國一方面為國聯會員國，一方面又自願居於調人地位，而不願加入漩渦，迨一經開會，自不能置身局外，不得不贊成决議案，（英國亦為凡爾賽簽字國之一）這樣一來，英國眞有好呌我左右為人難之勢，英國實有說不出的痛苦，原因在此。</p>
<p>所以德國儘管堅决地反對國聯議决案，而英國亦只有以冷靜態度處之，不能不說幾句風凉閒話，一則自已身為國聯議决案的一國，若過於重視德國的抗議，非但自己面子不好看，而亦翻不過身來，二則英國自願處於調人的地位，總不願雙方到破裂的地步，苟有調解的機會，英人還是願出來調解，所以在任何緊張的空氣中，必定要說得緩和一些，這是在英人的心理中，不能不懷如此願望，為後來望風轉舵的張本。</p>
<p>但回過頭來再看看德國的態度怎樣？二十日柏林電，希特勒生辰，檢閱勁旅，耀武揚威，同時並公布對國聯的抗議書，並將政府决定重整軍備之重大意義，重加申述，播音各國，公務員聯合會，釀資一百萬馬克，獻呈元首，以為德國人民體育訓練之角，卽在這一點看來，德國的抗議書，果為爆竹呢？還是炸彈？究竟是什麽東西？</p>

<p>今年入春以來，晴朗的日子不多，然而雨水却也來得很少，三月里的桃花水也沒有像一股人們所想像的發下來；但是整天陰霾，沒有幾個完全太陽面見却是實在的。</p>
<p>「咳！老天爺簡直要收拾窮百姓的性命它去年那樣稱心稱意的旱了一年，今年却又是這麽一副嘴臉，天氣又陰，四月里的天也沒有這樣寒冷的。這英說春熟要大打折扣，恐怕樹頭上的花菓和將來的田稻也要受到它的影響了！」</p>
<p>近來小老虎才順時常嘆着氣，自言自語地咒詛着天，怨恨着天，嗔怪老天爺姑意和它作對。其實他那里知道，那一個農人都不是和他同一個命運，在這饑荒恐怖的壓迫下掙扎着！吃了今天，明天就不知在那里，過了明天，後天又不曉得怎樣過下去？甚至，有時也許連了今天都還挨不過去。像這種慘凄的情形，在目前的每一個農村里，隨時隨地都很容易見到。</p>
<p>小老虎才順一家有十一只口子吃飯，而能够做事的祇有他和他的大兒子阿根二個人。在往年，他們除了耕種之外，還有一行副業，——紮紙頭房子——冥屋，這一年至多也有二百元左右的收入，可是如今那兒還會有什麽閑錢來超荐祖宗，燒紙頭房子？</p>
<p>他三年以來，花菓收不着，田又種個空，紙頭房子更沒有人家來請敎他紮了；於是他的整個生活泉源不啻吿了個渴！</p>
<p>前年收起了幾擔穀子，除完了糧和納了租，所剩祇得有限，餐餐喝豆粥，纔勉强挨到了去年春上便光了。去年田爿給乾得龜裂，剛插好秧苗全給枯死，至現在足足一年沒有一些兒進賬：借着當着賣着過生活。如今當的當完了，借的借絕了，買的就是有也沒有人要了，這種日子眞呌小義虎才順活受罪！去年時常自己安慰自己似的想：「大荒之後，必是大熟！」所以他今年滿擬是一個大熟之年，可以補償去年的歉收，而借的也許可以還些出去，當的也許可以贖些回來。不道今年春熟的第一砲先把他這個幻夢打得粉碎；秋收究竟是一個很渺茫的希望啊！</p>
<p>小老虎才順為了吃口太重，好容易把一個纔十四歲的第二兒子託人荐到了一爿鹹貨行里去當學徒，將一個十七歲的女兒去催夫家來草草地娶了過去，同時又把一個十二歲的小女兒送給了一隻小網船上去做童養媳。這樣一來，在他的肩頭上固然平白地减少了三只吃口，然而現在還有八個人吃飯，八個人倒底也不是容易對付的呵！因此他也時常感到自己有被吞下去的危險：</p>
<p>「㗒！年成這樣荒，吃口又這樣重，我總有一天會被他們吞下去的，咳！總有一天……」</p>
<p>『春寒凍死老黃牛！」他除了每天對這灰黯色的天發愁，咒詛又有什麽辦法</p>
<h3 id="c207">家的誕生 <a href="#c207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>— 程銓</p>
<p>兩口兒已經大家都生活到了中年的邊綫上，自己們也全明白：已經不再是可以進天國的孩子，也不再適宜把建築在實生活的基礎上面的男女孩子們底友好與愛戀當作詩一般的游戲去欣賞，去神往了；大的兩口兒，老是落在生活的邊綫上沒有着落地浪着幹麼？而且事實上，這也不是一次二次的事了：一些相識者們全用了不懂的心思瞧着我們：「又不是流浪人，也應該有一個家了啊。」眞的，話是一點都沒錯兒，就連我們自家兒都早就那麽想過了：應該有一個家了啊１不是嗎？連螞蟻都有着自己們底可愛的小窩，為什麽人便應當從流浪中出生之後，却又得無休止地重去繼續這怕人的永世的流浪呢？—這，可並不是好受的生活啊。</p>
<p>是事實；兩口兒漸漸地在走出靑春的，嬉戲的埃用樂園了，而一方面則從中年的心情下體騐到了一陣微微的空虛：明白這是己經必須用正經的臉來對付生活的時代了，於是感到怕，而且孤單；接着便想到從桃色之戀情中走着過來的兩口兒，必須開始來擠在一起；也就是說，必須有一個自己的小窩了。</p>
<p>兩個人全都有那麽一種感覺與需要，於是，便那麼想了：卽使自己的力量微弱如螞蟻，但螞蟻也是十分勇敢地用自己的勞力來建設自己的小小的安身處的呢。那麼着，我們便帶了二顆依舊是孩子氣的心，與螞蟻一般的忍耐和勞作，不怕，不憂愁，也不萎縮，開始在這寂寞而荒凉的世界上，擇取了「用自己的勞苦來產生一個可愛的小小的家吧」這一個想念來做生活的目標，而走着每個從孩子時代跨進中年的人所必需經過的，同樣的路了。</p>
<p>也許「家」這一個東西是多少有點可怕的吧？是的，這沒有人可以否定。然而，生活的本身就祇不過是一種誘惑、一種憧啊。當一種安樂的家的媚影在中年的邊綫上開始不停地閃耀着的當兒、人便什麼都忘掉了，人拚命地去就着她，獲得她，忘掉了危險，也忘掉了可怕！</p>
<p>同樣地，為了家，為了自己底家，我們也得開始一個時期的可怕的勞作了，兩口兒在生活的險濤裏是需要力量的；首先，為了艱難的物質上的基礎、我們得死拚地把各人的勞力增加起來，也曾把工作自願地增加到每天十二小時以</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>上的長度，也曾努力地忍受了不可言說的長時期的隔離，但這些是全用了可能的忍耐度過去了，而接着來的，却是舊社會制度的影的絆石，於是，為了要搬除，抗爭與粉碎，力量與勇氣；便又成為必需的了。幼年的兩口兒是微弱的；但卽使是微弱的又有什麽關係呢？人依着他自已的綫路走，勞作，又流着汗，那麽着，我們便慢慢地爭得了合在一起的可能，有了居住的地方，有了從一件而二伴而增多起來的傢具，有了　一種適宜於兩個年靑人合作起來的心情，有了家。</p>
<p>誕生了家！但是一種從生活的行動上出發的難受的恐怖跟着誕生了呢却也。日子是有着無窮盡的長，生活却有着無窮盡的渺茫；然而，却是「有了家的人」了啊。</p>
<p>彷彿是一隻徬徨在牆脚下的垂死的蝸牛：負着殼，我開始感到它底重，而且怕了。</p>
<h3 id="c208">漁汛 <a href="#c208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>— 時風</p>
<p>翁家宅的居民，是以漁為生的，每年春秋兩季，是產魚最盛的季節。翁家池塘是條官河，祇要不侵犯誰家的壩頭，（雖然壩頭也是各自私立的）在自家的魚壩上一天到晚張網，沒有人敢來干涉的。但是那里幾十家的漁父，都是安份守己，他們把生命都付托於這條池塘。什麼時候是卵子的時侯，每個壩頭上就不見有人張網捕魚。魚類的繁殖彷彿農夫希望於他們的稻麥一樣，不敢摧殘他們的生命的。所以兩季漁汛，每個漁翁都笑顏逐開捕上整桶的魚上市鎭上去販賣，那些小魚雜蝦作為每晚上的酒餚，大家安閑地過着，好像他們的生命祇是為了捕魚。</p>
<p>桃花怒放的時候，又是翁家宅的漁汎之期。阿根，一個粗壯的漢子，沒有要妻，家里有一母一妹，今天他揹上漁具出門的時候，吩咐過他十一歲的妹妹：「不要胡亂去玩，木桶里兩條魚別被野貓拉走了！唱着以歌，迎着東升的太陽，大踏步向壩頭走去。走通兩條泥岸，金三從迎面跑來衝着他說：</p>
<p>「翁家河上頭要做墳了，那天殺的河面壩出了一丈多，不是要我們的命！」金三滿面通紅，額角上的汗珠從兩邊眉毛角吊下來，像兩條蚯蚓似的在赤色的臉膛上盤旋。見了阿根，彷彿就是天殺的仇人，摩拳擦掌起來。</p>
<p>「眞的做墳？」阿根也跳了起來。去年冬天他就知道鎭上金老爺要葬他的老太爺，陰陽先生吳三官，每天帶了羅盤針在翁家池塘左右端相。他說過上河是龍潭虎穴，要是做了墳，子孫必大發。現在果然要把河面做風水了。</p>
<p>「那殺才！祇知拍馬屁，為什麽不認金老爺做爸，時常到我們這里來要飯吃！」</p>
<p>別談起那灰孫子了！他早想佔霸池塘！」</p>
<p>「要我們不吃飯？先要他的狗命！我們到壩上去對太家說。」</p>
<p>壩頭上已有幾個安份的漁民正在張　，看見金三阿根前來，大家招呼着「　一。</p>
<p>『大家聽了…』金三　　猴子踨上自家的壩頭，「金老爺要做墳了，你們知道嗎？……」</p>
<p>二哥兒是翁家宅上的丑角，他打渾，玩笑，有正經事就鬼一般地溜走。今天他到壩上第一個早，剛誇耀過他捕得了一尾三斤多的大魚。聽了金三的演說，發出他那種特有的使人發笑的笑聲，在對河喊了起來；</p>
<p>「聽着：那狗才請我們的金三爺喝杯酒呢！」</p>
<p>果然雷也似的笑聲從兩岸鬨了起來，更有鼓着掌的。</p>
<p>「喝鳥酒？要斷糧了！」金三用更大的聲音喊着：「那天殺的做墳做到河面上來，河面壩出一丈寬，大家到上河去看看…」金三彷彿發了瘋，在壩頭上蹤着，一雙要爆出眼眶的大眼珠盯着對河的二哥兒。</p>
<p>吳三官到翁家河來，是大家知道的，號小子說龍潭虎穴也是大家知道的，二哥兒向上河頭打了個眼照，那里有一排木椿直在河中心，他避過金三的視綫去玩他那條三斤多的大魚了。</p>
<p>河上這時候是靜着，祗有金三的聲音撤野似的饗着，每個人恨恨地咬着牙，他們的心都飛到家里去了，他們有老母，妻子，弱妹，兒子，一家人的嘴巴都向着這池塘的；現在把死人葬到河上來啫住活人的嘴…</p>
<p>「這這是官河…」幾個人喊了起來。</p>
<p>「這是官河！我們到縣政府去講活，大老爺總講公理的！」</p>
<p>「大家一齊去！」金三彷彿是首領，命令着。</p>
<p>「我們一齊去！」大衆的聲音。</p>

<p>— 西蒙</p>
<p>能够把我們從粗俗的苦惱的人生之綱超脫出來的，惟有夢，惟有夢可以給予嫌厭於紛紜的世事的人以一種舒適的慰籍。如果沒有夢的浸潤，我想人生將會形出異樣的乾枯，或者减去許多的興緻。而有似一片無邊無際的浩渺的沙漠，儘是飛塵黃土在飛蔽着天日，夢，彷拂就是沙漠間很稀貴的也許是一泓淸水，也許是一株靑靑的草，更或許是遙遠的遠方的綠色的屋子，使長途跋涉的旅人現極度勞頓的中問，會有尋到一窩水以沾喉，或者是有着略略安憇的地方，不至於是成為無盡頭的永恒的辛苦。雖然那最後的休息的綠色的屋子還遠着呢，但期待的心德是自然醖釀着了、因而沈重的脚步會不知不覺加了勁。現實到底是單調而又醜惡的，紛陣於你的眼底的是一幅慘淡可怕的畫面，那上邊有互相爭奪的揪打的呌喊，有被踐踏的悲哀的呻吟，有獰猙的嘴臉，有血，有眼淚，而你自已就是那里邊各樣各形的角色中的一個角色。誰瞅住誰在一千回留神中有一回滑溜，便一棒打過去，人家是那麼覷準着，你也是那麽覷準着，在日常生活中各人全都把自已的眞形像掩藏，而另外假扮一個或許是堅硬的或許是軟弱的面孔去跟週遭的人們軋鑠，撞襲，因為生活—也就是現實吧、是一種鬥爭，一種緊張的行程，不能片刻放手，讓別人從他的身子上踩　去。在這險劣的現實—生活的行程上、你能換一口氣，後響翻身，矣一笑麽？</p>
<p>然而人徧是不得不為生活的指使者，——現實的俘虜，而生活的現實簡直就等於一個囚籠，一架鎖練，緊緊地牢牢地把你綑縛着，約束着想逃脫出來不成，全是無用的妄想。不過這囚籠，這架鎖是無形存在的，可是你知道自已完全走不出它的圈子里。不信，想一想吧，你怎的每天自早及暮，一年到底老是無休無止的奔波着，磨折着，弄得漸漸頭髮變白，眼發花，垂垂老了。難道不是遭受那生活的種種酷刑的結果？於是你一點也不否認現實的生活的煩惱的源，是痛苦的淵藪，感到絕對的失望，乏味，像一片沙漠實在太枯燥了。幸而有夢，正同沙漠上有淸的水，有靑靑的草，也有綠靑的屋，使你不至成為一個永恒的絕望的旅人了，夢是美麗的，溫暖的，像一個渾身飄着香芬的縹緻的女人，趁着你暫時跟現實分手的期間—總是閉着眼睛的時候吧。她笑瞇瞇的輕輕地來造訪你了，於是你迷迷忽忽地呌她帶進燦爛的使人陶醉的天堂上去，因着她一些柔情的慰撫和婉變的體貼，不由地忘却現實所有的糾纏的痛楚了，有夢里，你是快樂的，幸福的，為着你將瞧到平時所瞧到的人或物，得到平時所得不到的種種貴重的東西，夢會儘量的無吝嗇地賜與給你。而且在夢里你看見眞正的一自已了。</p>
<p>雖然不會因此而湯平了現實的瘡瘟，但借着她的慰安你多少總可以獲得精神上的排解，暫時間跨越那痛苦的苦惱的現實之綱的羈絆。同時有一度的夢的挹注，你那對於現實厭嫌到極點的疲憊的心，又將一度支持着，像長途的旅人期待那遠方的綠屋的到達。</p>

<p>— 知</p>
<p>老友，多時沒有見到你的文字，總以為多少轉變了些吧，但是，我眞欣慰，你還是唱着你固有的調子。這自我們相識以來，我始終是印象得最深的，你還能忘記你替我作的序嗎？幾年以來，幼時相混的人兒，各走了各的路，世途的磨難，在我們各個的身上，雖留下絕不相同的創痕，但是受傷時的血，大家都是一樣紅的，現在你，可說行程已吿一段落，略事休息，而我則越和你相反不同了。我固然不可判定我現在的情景是好是壞，但，遠遠的聽見你唱着你固有不變的調子，我私地裏想：該換種嗓子吧？</p>
<p>鎭江的豪遊，我豈能忘記？至於從那時節起想到我現在失業的事，我倒並不覺得有什麽特別的戚懷，但，偶一忖到有幾個以商人的態度來對待朋友的人兒，不禁寒心之極。二年來潦倒的生活，我難道還沒有看透嗎？不過是今天偶然提一提而已。</p>
<p>說我閉門讀書，那並不假；我不願受書本的束縛，也不假，一句話，我的確是「閉門而讀書」。我的讀書旣不是為了「書中自有黃金屋」，更不是為了「開卷有益」的那套舊話‘却是為了我要脫去長袍穿「短打」而找個引導罷了。我記得你寫過「棄文就武」的文章，（裏面所說的當然記不淸了）曾發揮過「文」之無用論，那麽我的讀書，在你就該明瞭了。</p>
<p>鶴久未會面，許是因為我「閉門讀書」的緣故吧？這次你家裏的事，也曾略聞一二。這還有何說呢？但是想到了我自己的事，我認為比你的更要痛苦呢。別談吧，這些老話，讓我們來看看今年的春是怎樣。再用說嗎？今年的春是多雨。</p>
<p>說出來你會不大相信，我昨晚化了三毛錢去看了一張中國重攝的有聲片子，竟很滿意地從頭至尾看完。你會想我是低級興趣者，同時你也定能想及低級興趣者之悠悠然。這，假使在五年前我說這句話，現在問你有什麼感想？你一定能回答我說是「五年前的感想。</p>
<p>別提吧，五年前的事，甚至於從現在最目前一秒鐘以往的事！來，讓我們把今天起的五年後的事，和現在比較變到怎麽樣地步罷，卽此作答。</p>

<h3 id="c214">好萊塢黑幕重重電影演員的招考（下） <a href="#c214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>— 馥</p>
<p>以上所說的，是關於舞台招考方面的黑慕。好萊塢有一種演員的代理人，係一種高等的荐頭店，專門替演員們向各公司接洽。等到合同成立了，他按照合同的薪水，支取百分之十。當然，一位大明星，每星期的薪水，高到三四千美金，代理人每星期坐拿三四百的佣金，那是很可觀了。但是小演員呢？你以為代理人一定沒有什麽可拿的了。但是他亦有他的法子。他吿訴你，秘密的告訴你：「某公司現在正託某代理人尋覓一個人，而他那裏沒有，我薦你去。但是……那個代理人亦要百分之十的佣金的。」你答應了，因為你念於要尋到一個位置。</p>
<p>結果，那某代理人本來沒有那回事，而你的代理人却穩拿了百分之二十的佣金。有的時候，所謂某某代理人的，竟多至三個人以上。你的薪水却不過二十五塊錢一天，除了付去三四個百分之十的佣金外，所餘的祇够做車錢的。但是永存的希望，或者有一天能够得到一個長工作，總使你忍氣的接受，雖然你有些知道此中的黑幕。</p>
<p>此外還有野鷄影片公司的黑慕。有一次，有一家小公司招請學生式的演員，要拍幾張學校生活的短片。某甲又去應考了，因為他自已知道，他對於學校生活是很內行，並且是位運動健將。他抱到那裏，看見那所謂公司的房屋，亦不過係一種臨時性質，排戲的主任亦並不難見到。不差的，他吿訴他，他正是他們所需要的人才。他請他送幾張相片來看看。當然，他歡然的答應了。</p>
<p>過了一天，他將相片送了去。那位主任看了，還不差……但是……哦，他太熱心了，他一定要替他設法，成全這件事……但是最好再拍幾張相片。剛巧那裏有一個攝影師，他於電影的經騐很深，他一定知道怎樣拍生動活潑的照相的。價錢亦不大，不過八塊錢一打，因為那不過是那個攝影師額外的收入而已。某甲一想亦不差，送到公司裏去的照相，一定要生動活潑的。為什麽要可惜一些小費而放棄了一個好機會呢？於是他就和那位主任約好了明天晚上來拍照。</p>
<p>到了明天晚上，他去一看，拍照的人，男女學生打扮的，不知道有多多少少，好像開一個大學二年級的跳舞會似的。那位先生一算，那裏一共有七八十個人，每人八塊錢，收入就很可觀了，他靈機一動，就縮了出去，决計等四年級開跳舞會的時候再來吧。果然，有一天他遇到了那天看見過的一位「女同學。」他就問她結果如何。原來她化了八塊錢，得到了一打活動小照片。戲從來沒有拍過，因為「公司停辦」了。</p>
<p>無綫電台的廣播，也是進身影界的一個好門路，當然亦不能沒有它的黑幕。據說有一家新的無綫電台要就立了，正在招考新人才。某甲又跑了去，見了一位編戲主任。他眞客氣極了。他沒有說什麼他正是他們所尋求的人等等。他說的是：「我看見了天才，是一望而知的。你就是一個！」他吿訴他，他和某某幾家大公司，巳經有了同意，祗要節目排演完全，就可以訂立長期合同的。但是，他有極好的戲文，極好的節目，合同楚沒有問題的，不過要先作三天的試演而已。不過……（來！）在排戲之中，那個導演是個械有身份的人，所以不略收一點補助費。那亦不多，每次試演，不過收費二元五角。當然試演的人不止他一個，但是那位主任吿訴他，别人不過是試試，而合同却除他莫屬的了。他肚子裏明白，立即設詞退了出去。</p>
<p>過了幾個禮拜，他去打聽打聽，試演果然是有的，但是有沒有人聽，却是一個疑問，因為那個試演不過像唱幾張留聲機器片子凑凑空檔而已。他拿出鉛筆來一算，三十個人，每星期試演兩次，每次收費二元五角，（共是五個星期，總數是七百五十元。多雖不多，壞却不壞。</p>
<p>黑幕眞多。形形色色、不能一概而論的。有用照相騙錢的，亦有用收音於唱片上騙錢的。他們招考無綫電歌唱員的時候，先叫每人收音一張，好給公司當局去選擇。往往有人化了五塊大洋，收了一張價値兩角五分的唱片。至於謀事，亦不過空勞往返而已。</p>
<p>這種黑慕，像聊齋誌裏的念秧一樣，眞是詭計百出，防不勝防，好在聰明人自已隨時隨地留意而已。（完）</p>

<p>在這經濟恐慌與政治危機空壓得大部分國家喘不過氣來，不得不向戰爭中去找尋不可知的出路的時候，世界第二次大戰風雲的緊急差不多巳經成為不可掩飾的事實了。於是有一部分正視着現實的劇作家，感覺到兵兇戰危的可怕，撫模着第一次大戰的創傷，大聲疾呼地喊出戰爭危險的警號，製作了不少近於反戰的影片。由於作者事理認識與了解程度上的差别，以及電影企業的生意眼的通過，因此，我們所看過的作品，不是人道主義地對於戰爭罪惡之消極的詛咒與暴露，便是無原则地反對一切不同性質的戰爭。所以祇成為近於反戰的東西；但是同時也有和這相反的一羣劇作者，他們成為戰爭製造者的傳聲筒，黷武主義，軍國思想的支持架，與擴張軍備，增加軍費的提案與行動，唱着合拍的急速進行曲。</p>
<p>從「海上權威」到這「飛將軍」，就是這一傾向的顯例。前者誇耀了飄着「花旗」的偉大海軍之寬力，這兒又作了龐然的航空母艦，及成羣飛機的示威。</p>
<p>傳導着這一使命的影片「飛將軍」，劇本本軍的編製，却分明是欠佳的。</p>
<p>在震耳的機聲，亂目的機影中，作者浮現了一個粗暴，曠野，輕浮，自大的少年湯姆出來作為英雄，替他作自負與好鬥的說敎。說他山於鄰居的現任軍官畢蘭尼干的介紹，入了軍事訓練班。他因着出風頭的飛行不當，被長官責駡而駕着飛機飛去，作者就硬使他中途出了毛病降落在少决　蒂的咖啡店前，讓他有了向女人吹牛的機會，把虛搆的劇情向羅曼司中去發展，自然男女羅曼司是以三角型為有趣的，於是先把這少女昆蒂的愛情屬於畢蘭尼干，這樣以長官與下屬的關係來作愛的競爭，自然糾紛就更多了。他又寫畢蘭尼干為了要視察湯姆的技術，同乘着一個飛機，再在機身於空中突然着火這一偶然機會上，寫畢蘭尼干因為怕死便乘傘跳下，而湯姆却安然下降這一做作，來抑制畢蘭尼干，表揭湯姆。接着再讀他們在琵蒂的店中相互出醜。</p>
<p>在戀愛上吃虧於長官的湯姆自然也該在職位上來努力的，於是湯姆也終於升到副官了。海軍大操演，空軍大發動的正本戲，也就在這時正式開幕，長長的鏡頭作為海空軍多方的表演，展衝，掩護，襲擊，烟幕，盡了總示威的能事後，再歸到個人英雄的豐功偉續上來，呌湯姆的機翼被折了，陷入危險中去，當時和他同坐的又是畢蘭尼干，這次却是畢氏出風頭的機會了，冒着險救了湯姆，據說驕傲輕浮的他從此也被折服了，於是，畢氏把琵蒂當作獎品般地讓給了這位少年多才的空軍英雄，自己又升官去了，湯姆與琵蒂英雄美人，功成名就地團圓大吉。</p>
<p>除了故事的虛搆，情節的牽强，和「花旗」軍威的顯示外，似乎沒有什麼了。若有的話，那只是攝影的技術。</p>
<p>導演（Lloyd　Bacon）描寫人物個性的地方也未見佳妙，除了在湯姆洋洋自得地高談闊論，同伴却假寐來寫他的吹牛，軍官指導時他修指甲，模型演習作計戰劃他打磕睡，算是刻劃他的個性外，就只有哈哈大笑這特性了。至於寫湯姆屢次向琵蒂求愛，以被打耳光為榮幸等原是一般胡調水兵的本色。寫琵蒂的這人格更是模糊與矛盾，從認識到畢蘭尼干的離走，她始終沒有一點愛他的表現，而結果却突然要使她投向湯姆的傻抱去，這過程是太缺乏的。</p>
<p>演員大半是「海上權威」的原班，除了飛行技術以外的演技是極有限的，所以也用不着多說了。</p>

<p>— 緹雲</p>
<p>脫雷道：「你的記憶力倒不差。」華德又說道：「至於錢呢，一年半以前，你銀行裏有兩萬。現在恐怕一萬都沒有了吧。」脫雷接口道：「確實的數目，祇有五百左右了。再則，沒有付的退票亦很多。」華德聽了，祇覺得口呆眼定，知道和他辯駁或理論是沒有用的。自從五年之前，飛機出事之後，他就這樣的。</p>
<p>那是五年以前的事，他帶了他的父母和妹妹，坐了他自己駕駛的飛機到紐波特去。中途遇了大霧，他的父母雙親和幼妹都死了，但是他却死裏逃生，至今還活着。他身體雖活着，但他的靈魂却和他所愛的人一同死了。</p>
<p>那個亂子，並不是他的錯誤……因為沒有人能預知會遇到那種霧的。它不聲不響的上升，來襲擊他們，好像强盜襲擊行旅的客人一樣。脫雷在雲霧之中，盲目的飛行了幾個鐘頭之久。他眼看著汽油快完了。他的父母亦知道他精神上的痛苦他額角上的汗珠，一顆一顆地生出來。他咬緊了牙齒吿訴他們，他祗可以强制的停下去了。他的父母和妹妹並沒有驚喊，但他們臉上的可怖的表情，是他腦筋中永遠不能磨滅的，因為脫雷說完了話，引擎已經停住了，機身已在盤旋着，向着無底的深谷中墜了下去。</p>
<p>那是多末快活的一椿事，當他們出發的時候。天色是那麽晴朗。他們都覺得興高彩烈的，深知脫雷的駕駛術是一些毛病沒有的。但是天違人願，竟發生了這種慘劇。</p>
<p>他在醫院中蘇醒過來的時候，他已不是從前的脫雷派克了。後來他完全痊愈了，在身體方面，他曾一度做過航空郵政局的駕駛員，漸漸以不怕死著名了。他有鐵石般神經，在死神當前的時候，愈見得高興。一天一天的他冒着腦筋健全的駕駛員所不肯冒的危險。這些事都是華德勃立强所深知的……自從那慘事發生之後。但他總希望着他的性情，在年月既深之後，會慢慢忘記的。現在他看了脫雷的精神，却使他為之深憂起來了。</p>
<p>華德於是又問道：「那末五百用完了之後，你作什麽打算呢？」他想用金錢的話，來打動他實事求是的觀念。但脫雷却聳了聳肩說道：「在一個生活在雲天之中的人，有錢沒有錢，怎樣化法，都不成問題的。」華德勸着他道：「你還是這副光景。現在已經五年了，你該想穿些了。」</p>
<p>脫雷深思着，好像和自己滿話似的道：「我知道……我頭上裂了三個口子……但是父親，母親，和辛茜亞……他頓了一頓，心中一陣痛楚，然後父說道：「為什麽我要活着呢？世界上最親愛的三個人都死了，我反而僥倖的活着，難道找是貪生怕死的人……其實我的靈魂早巳和他們一同死去了……從此以後，我是永遠生存在雲天之中的人了。」　　華德一時說不出話來，但他一面駕駛着汽車，一面深思着。過了一回，他勉强地說道：　「你的感想我當然明白的，無論誰都要這樣的。但是這種無謂的冒險，難道是必須的嗎？為什麼你一定要這樣呢？』（未完）</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The Sino-British members of the Yunnan-Burma Boundary Survey Committee are separately selecting members from China. The establishment of the committee is expected to be in the autumn of this year. When it starts to proceed in the future, all the committee members will first go to the undetermined boundary sections of the Yunnan-Burma father boundary and conduct detailed inspections based on various historical and geographical materials. Then, they will hold meetings nearby for discussion, and finally hold a meeting in Nanjing to discuss and determine a draft agreement. The Yunnan-Burma Boundary Survey Promotion Association, organized by Yunnan natives in Beijing, held a meeting to determine three principles: 1. Expressing approval of the method of this Sino-British joint boundary survey committee. 2. This survey must conduct a thorough and detailed inspection of all actual conditions within the undetermined boundary in the southern section to provide a thorough solution. 3. Hoping that the government will proceed earnestly based on public opinion so as to resolve the long-standing case as soon as possible. It was also decided to draft an opinion paper on the Yunnan-Burma boundary survey based on the above three principles, submit it to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for reference, and announce this opinion to the people of the country. According to Zhang Weihan, a Yunnan native in Beijing, the Yunnan-Burma boundary case has been pending for 40 years. This time, the Sino-British sides agreed to jointly form a boundary survey committee to resolve the long-standing case, and they should be able to negotiate sincerely and determine the boundary. Moreover, the indigenous people in the Yunnan-Burma border area have been prone to disputes in the past due to the long-pending border issue. If it is resolved once and for all in the spirit of sincere negotiation, the Sino-British relationship will surely become even better. (21st Special Telegram)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) China and Persia are negotiating a treaty of commerce. Our country has submitted a draft, but the Persian side has not yet responded. Recently, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs received a telegram from the embassy in the Soviet Union stating that, according to the Persian chargé d'affaires, Persia's treaties of commerce with various countries will expire at the end of 1935. At that time, the Persian government intends to sign new equal treaties with various countries and is willing to use these new treaties as a blueprint to negotiate a treaty of commerce with the Chinese government. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs replied by telegram that since the Sino-Persian Treaty of Friendship has been established for a long time, the treaty of commerce should not be pending for too long. The Ministry hopes that the Persian government will respond to our original draft as soon as possible and proceed accordingly to facilitate the treaty of commerce. (21st Special Telegram)</p>

<p>(Tianjin) On the 17th, a conflict occurred between workers of the Dutch company building the port of Huludao and puppet workers. Both sides engaged in armed conflict with knives, axes, and wooden sticks. They fought fiercely at Pier No. 1 for a long time, and some even fired guns. The Japanese and puppet police brigade arrived and used force to stop them. Three puppet workers were seized by the Dutch workers. Due to severe injuries, more than 20 people were killed on the spot, and more than 30 were injured. Currently, the puppet workers are still planning to gather a large force for a second armed conflict. The reason for the conflict is that after the establishment of the puppet organization, the Dutch company continued to contract to build the port. The Japanese deliberately made things difficult for them and created various inconveniences in order to force them to terminate the contract automatically. The armed conflict on the 17th was entirely instigated by the Japanese. (21st Special Telegram)</p>

<h3 id="e41">Welcome to the American Economic Mission <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>— Ren</p>
<p>The American Economic Mission, which has been the subject of much discussion in society, will arrive today. The members of the delegation are mostly leaders from American industrial and commercial circles. Both the head of the delegation, Mr. Forbes, and the deputy head, Mr. Carroll, are familiar with the situation in the East. This trip is expected to last two months in China. In terms of time, it cannot be said to be short, but in terms of its mission, it cannot be said to be insignificant. This trip not only has historical value for the friendship between China and the United States, but also may reveal a bright and promising path for the future of trade between the two countries. We respectfully and sincerely welcome these visitors from the New World and offer our views on the matter.</p>
<p>After the Crusades, trade between Europe and Asia became frequent. Westerners were generally aware of the vastness of Asia. When Marco Polo served in the Yuan court and returned to write "The Travels of Marco Polo," Westerners became even more aware of the wealth of Asia. The so-called "Asia" at that time was mostly represented by China, which was regarded as "heaven on earth" and called the "Golden East." At that time, Westerners came to the East mostly out of curiosity and adventure, rather than being concerned with the economic and trade policies of a country. Later, transportation technology improved day by day, making it easier to travel between East and West. With the catalyst of the Opium War, China's maritime trade restrictions were greatly relaxed, and more and more people from various countries came to China. China and other countries then established formal economic relations, making China a part of the world's economic currents, with shared interests and mutual concerns. In this historical evolution, although our international relations with the United States developed later, the people of both countries have always treated each other with sincerity and without deceit. Therefore, the relationship between China and the United States has always been considered harmonious, and has not changed in the past decade. Taking the trade relationship between China and the United States as an example, last year China's exports to the United States amounted to more than 94.4 million yuan, and imports amounted to 272 million yuan, ranking first among all countries importing into China. In terms of economic cooperation between the two countries, there were reforms proposed by Mr. Jingqi regarding China's monetary system, reforms proposed by Mr. Smith regarding Chinese railways, and a plan proposed by Mr. Ganmier regarding China's adoption of the gold standard. These points can all show that China and the United States have indeed had quite close economic relations.</p>
<p>In the past, China and the United States already had a deep friendship, and we naturally hope that this friendship can be preserved forever in the future. Therefore, within our capabilities, we should sincerely help the United States, and the United States, within its capabilities, should also sincerely help us. In recent years, China has suffered frequent disasters and persistent famines. Coupled with the impact of the world panic, the people's purchasing power has been very different from the past. As a result, foreign trade has inevitably declined sharply. Now that the members of the Economic Mission have come from afar, we sincerely hope that they will conduct a detailed study of this, using inductive methods and a far-sighted perspective to investigate the causes and current situation of the decline in purchasing power, as well as methods of assistance. The future of Sino-American trade is the most fundamental issue in the future economic relationship between the two countries. Whether there can be a new development in Sino-American trade depends on whether there can be a new increase in purchasing power. To do otherwise and seek the development of Sino-American trade on today's purchasing power would be tantamount to draining the pond to catch all the fish. This would not only be detrimental to China, but also unwise for the United States. In other words, under the current situation, what China feels most urgent is to increase the purchasing power of the people through economic construction. At present, we are constantly making our utmost efforts to create a "New China." However, if our friendly ally, the United States, can add its assistance to this, then China's purchasing power should be easily restored, and the development of Sino-American trade will also be promising. This is one thing we hope the members of the Economic Mission will pay attention to in addition to our welcome.</p>
<p>However, the United States is certainly not indifferent to the increase in China's purchasing power. For example, the purpose of raising the price of silver is nothing more than to raise the purchasing power of the Far East. However, this silver policy has been in effect for nearly a year, and judging from the facts that have already materialized, the results are the opposite of what the United States hoped for. Since the price of silver has increased, China's silver reserves have been flowing out continuously. As of now, the amount is approximately 400 to 500 million yuan. The occurrence of this kind of phenomenon was probably not anticipated by the United States at the beginning. Currently, China's total silver reserves are estimated to be 1.5 billion yuan. The daily decrease in China's silver reserves has not been accompanied by a reverse proportional change in the purchasing power of the Chinese people. If the silver, the means of purchasing, is completely drained, there is bound to be a major upheaval in China's monetary system. This will not only be unhelpful to the development of Sino-American trade, but may even cast a shadow over the decades-long future of Sino-American friendship. This is the second thing we hope the members of the Economic Mission will pay attention to in addition to our welcome.</p>
<p>Today, the members of the Economic Mission are all people who have directly or indirectly interacted with China on a regular basis. Therefore, we firmly believe that their investigation and research will definitely achieve great success. In the future, when they return, they will not only influence the American business community, but China will also be affected. Helping others is helping oneself. We are very willing to help the United States, and the United States should also help us. Therefore, we sincerely hope that the mutual assistance and prosperity of the economies of China and the United States can have a further development after this Economic Mission's investigation.</p>

<p>Komoro, 20th. At 4:22 PM, Mt. Asama suddenly erupted with a loud sound, and at the same time, lava erupted, with black smoke rising into the sky. It was even more intense at night. Even in the distant Takasaki area, the ashfall was very heavy. In the Karuizawa area, stones fell like rain, temporarily disrupting traffic. The scene was extremely bleak. The state-owned forest in Konuma Village was set on fire by falling lava, and the fire was very fierce. The sky was ablaze, and the fire burned for nine hours before it was extinguished at 11:00 PM. The damage to the foothills was very severe. The extent of this eruption can be compared to that of 1929. The smoke rose 12,000 meters above sea level, making it a rare and spectacular sight in decades. (United News, 21st)</p>
<p>Taipei. The entire island of Taiwan and the Penghu Islands experienced two strong earthquakes this morning at 6:02 AM and 6:27 AM. The magnitude of the earthquake was 60, making it the most severe earthquake in decades. The epicenter was located in the upper reaches of the Huangliu River in southern Hsinchu Prefecture. The damage in various places is very severe. Railways were destroyed, iron bridges were broken, and tunnels collapsed in a total of 25 locations. Telecommunications were disrupted. The most severely affected area was Hsinchu Prefecture. The damage in Taichung Prefecture was also great. A large fire broke out in Shimizu Street, and the ground nearby cracked, spewing out mud. The damage in Taipei and Tainan Prefectures and the eastern coast was relatively light. (China United Press, 21st)</p>
<p>Taipei. At 6:00 PM on the 21st, the Taiwan Governor-General's Police Bureau announced the following:</p>
<p>Hsinchu Prefecture Taichung Prefecture</p>
<p>Deaths 854 1,498</p>

<p>The most severely affected areas are Neipu Village in Fengyuan County and Shimizu Street in Dajia County. (Dentsu, 21st)</p>
<p>Taipei. The damage from the earthquake in the Taichung area this time is beyond expectations. Communication organs in the affected areas have lost contact with various parties, making it difficult to determine the details. However, the number of people crushed to death has reached more than 3,000, and the affected areas number 30. Due to the lack of communication organs, rumors are spreading everywhere. The Governor-General's Office has contacted the Taiwan Army Command to make efforts to suppress the wavering public sentiment. (Dentsu, 21st)</p>
<p>Report from the Meteorological Observatory</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Central Meteorological Observatory issued the following report regarding the violent earthquake that occurred in Taipei this morning: At 8:02 AM (Tokyo time) on the 21st, the entire island of Taiwan felt an unusually severe earthquake. Taipei and Taichung were moderately affected, while Tainan and Mount Ali were only slightly affected. The shaking was most intense in Hsinchu and Taichung Prefectures, and there is likely to be considerable damage. It is noted that the last major earthquake in Taiwan occurred in Chiayi Prefecture in March of 1906, with 1,300 deaths. More recently, there were earthquakes in the Taichung area in December of 1930 and in the Yilan area in August of 1934, but the damage was not significant. (United News, 21st)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Central Meteorological Observatory further reported on the earthquake in Taiwan as follows: The epicenter of the earthquake in Taiwan this morning was likely in the area of the lower reaches of the Daan River in Hsinchu and Taichung Prefectures. The depth of the epicenter was very shallow, about ten kilometers below the surface. Because the epicenter was shallow, the shaking was limited to a local area but was extremely intense, resulting in significant damage. A considerable number of aftershocks are still expected in the future, but the situation is gradually calming down. (United News, 21st)</p>
<p>Taichung Suffers the Greatest Damage</p>
<p>Taipei. Among the damages caused by this morning's earthquake, Taichung Prefecture suffered the most severe damage. As of 1:00 PM today, the number of deaths in Fengyuan County reached 1,039, with 3,202 seriously injured. In the Shimizu Street area of Dajia County, more than 1,500 bodies have been found as of 1:00 PM, and the situation is tragic. 631 houses were completely destroyed and 76 houses were half-destroyed. It is feared that the damage in other areas is also very severe. Due to the disruption of communications, the details are unknown. The Taipei Governor-General's Office dispatched rescue teams immediately after receiving the report and is currently rushing sanitary materials and other items. (Dentsu, 21st)</p>
<p>Taipei. The epicenter of the earthquake this morning was in Taichung, which suffered severe damage. In addition to the collapse of the railway bridge between Fengyuan and Houli, many other sections of the railway were also damaged. In Dajia, a fire broke out, and the losses are incalculable. The telegram and telephone communications to Taichung are almost completely destroyed. Repairs began at 9:16 AM, and the only connection currently working is the one between Taipei, Taichung, and Hualien. The sixth and seventh tunnels on the mountain line of the Taiwan Longitudinal Railway have cracked, and the inside of the eighth tunnel has collapsed. (Dentsu, 21st)</p>

<p>Railways Destroyed, Ground Collapses</p>
<p>Taipei. The damage to the railways from this earthquake is unprecedented. There were 25 locations where bridges were destroyed and tunnels cracked, collapsed, or caved in. The railways in Hsinchu and Taichung Prefectures, where the epicenter was located, were especially badly damaged, to the point of being completely destroyed. The seventh tunnel on the mountain line of the Taiwan Longitudinal Railway, between the Shiliufen Station in Miaoli County, Hsinchu Prefecture, and the Daan Station in Taichung Prefecture, suddenly dropped seven feet. Many iron bridges were dislodged, making it impossible to restore the mountain line for the time being. The coastal line tracks have collapsed in many places. The Railway Department is now fully mobilized and making every effort to restore them, and it may be possible to restore them barely in the near future. (United News, 21st)</p>

<p>Taipei. The damage situation in Hsinchu Prefecture is unclear due to the interruption of telephone lines. However, many houses have collapsed, causing residents to take refuge on the roads, creating a chaotic scene. Due to the two strong earthquakes, almost all civilian houses were destroyed. The most severely affected area was a household outside the North Gate, where all six family members were buried alive in the collapsed house. The strong men's corps and the police worked hard to rescue them, but three of them had already died, and the other three were seriously injured. Two people died each in the South Gate and West Gate.

<p>(London) The plan for the Imperial Conference to be held next month has been completed today. The purpose of this conference is to determine the opinions of the prime ministers of the various British colonies regarding Britain's foreign policy. The government believes that the most important thing is to reach a more in-depth understanding with Soviet Russia. This plan must at least be approved by the various colonies. The first meeting will be chaired by Prime Minister MacDonald, and Foreign Secretary Simon will attend to explain in detail his plan to maintain peace in Europe and the world. Other important events will likely be the formal national defense plan of the empire, and the United Kingdom will also have to adopt a definite policy towards Japan's withdrawal from the League of Nations. The individual defense issues of the various colonies will be discussed in detail, and it is likely that the Ministers of the Army and Aviation will also attend. Another matter is the Imperial Commercial Agreement of the last Ottawa Conference. The Prime Minister will ask the prime ministers of the various regions whether the original agreement should be continued or whether further plans should be made. (National News, 21st)</p>
<h3 id="e46">Germany Protests League of Nations Resolution, Three Countries Remain Silent, Unexpectedly Mildly Worded German Dispatch, Leaving Room for Future Negotiations <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>(London) The German government's short dispatch opposing the resolution passed by the League of Nations Council condemning Germany's rearmament has not caused turmoil in the capitals of the three major European powers: Britain, France, and Italy. Major British cabinet members have gone out to enjoy the Easter holiday, so the German dispatch will not be considered until after the holiday is over. Politicians in France and Italy have not expressed surprise at Germany's actions. It is reported that Paris does not want to respond at present because Germany has indicated that it will have another protest. According to a French government spokesman, the German dispatch is not important and does not need to be criticized. Rome has published the German dispatch, but officials and newspapers have not commented on it. It is believed that the Italian government is also waiting for Germany to present its second protest before issuing an opinion. According to the German dispatch, it is protesting the League of Nations' resolution condemning Germany. This dispatch was sent to the 14 countries related to the League of Nations' resolution, but the dispatch to Denmark was mild in tone, stating that the German government specifically sent this dispatch to inform the Danish government that Germany had sent dispatches to other countries. When the League of Nations Council voted, the Danish representative abstained from voting in favor of condemning Germany. (Reuters, 21st)</p>
<p>(London) The German dispatch opposing the Geneva resolution is still the focus of the world stage today. Rumors are rampant in the capitals of various countries. However, most people believe that this response from Germany is more to appease the anger of the German people than to deal with other countries. Paris and Rome both believe that it is not worthy of attention. Although Japan calls it "an absolute rejection of the League of Nations' actions," it also says that "the door to future discussions has not been closed." Officials here feel that between the lines, the German diplomatic community still intends to return to the League of Nations. However, at the same time, Germany will also adhere to its original intention of maintaining its rearmament plan regardless of the Treaty of Versailles. French officials stated today that the Geneva resolution was a collective action of the Council, so countries can only file Germany's protest and cannot take any other actions. (National News, 21st)</p>
<p>(Berlin) According to diplomatic sources, Germany may still participate in the various international negotiations currently underway. The protest that Germany lodged with the United Kingdom, France, and Italy this afternoon due to the resolution of the League of Nations Council was generally expected to be very rude and inconsistent with diplomatic practice. However, it was not so after it was issued, which shows that leader Hitler accepted the advice of the diplomatic authorities and issued it in a moderate form. In that case, the possibility of Germany participating in international negotiations has been preserved by the diplomatic authorities. (Havas, 20th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Newspapers are attacking the League of Nations, and although their tone is arrogant, their words imply that Germany has reserved room for future negotiations in its protest. For example, the Berliner Tageblatt said, "The people of Geneva are acting blindly, and we should guide them. Our German neighbors are seeing ghosts in the shadows, and we should inform them." (Havas, 21st)</p>
<p>(Paris) Newspapers commented on the German protest, saying that the wording was intense but not as extreme as expected. Le Petit Parisien said, "There are those on Hitler's left and right who advocate moderation, and those who advocate radical action. Looking at the protest, it is clear that the moderates have prevailed." Le Petit Journal did not attach much importance to the German protest, saying, "Its purpose is only to express its views and not to remain silent. As for Germany's true answer and true defense of the League of Nations' resolution, the competent authorities are drafting it." The Les Echos' tone was similar, and it said, "What is unknown is what Germany's so-called expression of its position is." Le Figaro said that the reasons cited by Germany have no value in law, and the so-called Council resolution is a kind of differential treatment, which is even more inexplicable. However, "in terms of the wording of the protest, it is clear that Germany has no intention of rejecting negotiations." (Havas, 21st)</p>

<p>(Berlin) Today is the 46th birthday of the German leader, Hitler. The details of the national celebration are as follows: Berlin and other parts of the country were decorated with flags and streamers on Saturday and Sunday. Hundreds of thousands of people in Berlin marched in the streets to congratulate Hitler. The weather was clear and the breeze was gentle, which increased the people's joy. The highlight of the celebration was the parade of the German Army Commander's Honorary Detachment. On Wilhelm Street, people were thronging, rushing to sign the guest book in front of the Prime Minister's Office. Among those who came to sign this morning was Max Wolff, leader of the Brownshirts of East Prussia, who started from Sensburg ten days ago, walking 50 kilometers every day to reach the capital. Premier Hitler, appreciating his sincerity, specially provided him with breakfast and personally met with him. The gifts sent by the people were of all kinds, without exception. A baker in white clothes presented a large birthday cake to the Premier, with a giant sugar rabbit squatting on the cake, wishing him a happy Easter. There was also a trainload of huge oil paintings, as well as sculptures, books, photography supplies, and socks and gloves, countless. The flowers presented were particularly numerous and beautiful beyond description. However, there were no cigars or alcohol presented because it is a well-known fact throughout the country that Hitler does not smoke or drink. At 10:30 this morning, foreign envoys from various countries came one after another to congratulate Hitler, followed by representatives from the military, political, and other circles, such as Goebbels, General Göring, Commander-in-Chief of the National Defense Forces General von Blomberg, and Brownshirt leaders, who personally congratulated Hitler. At 11:30, Hitler went out to give a speech to the people's groups to express his gratitude. Then the honorary guard paraded, and Hitler stood upright at the main entrance of the Prime Minister's Office to receive their salute. (National News, 20th)</p>

These aircraft have recently been assigned to the team, and Hitler has named it the "Horst Wessel" Team, in memory of the great man of the party who was assassinated by the Communists.

<p>(Moscow) Izvestia published an article entitled "Warning," detailing the discussion and resolution of the League of Nations Administrative Council, and pointed out that the Soviet Union has always opposed the Treaty of Versailles. It said, "All financial, economic, and military deceptions in the Treaty of Versailles have now been abolished, and the powers with historical responsibility for the treaty have also acknowledged this, and since the treaty can no longer be forcibly restored, it can be seen that the treaty has become a useless burden. However, the powers have further raised the question of 'what can be done in the future?' This question is extremely important politically, and the League of Nations Administrative Council has resolved to warn Germany, accusing it of unilaterally destroying the European status quo and causing people to step into a cruel war in the future. Germany is eager to change the few remaining territorial clauses of the Treaty of Versailles and wants to realize its open aggressive plan to expand its territory. All of this is a threat to the world, and the members of the League of Nations (including Denmark) have all acknowledged this. All the allied countries in their resolutions have unanimously stated that they are willing to take defensive measures against Germany's actions to disrupt peace. The resolution unanimously passed by the Administrative Council is a great political event. We must not ignore its significance. Although Fascist Germany has various means of threatening its neighbors, Bismarck had warned in the past not to underestimate the 'insignificant elements' in politics. At present, most countries believe that Germany is threatening peace, so they must find ways to defend themselves. This belief is what Bismarck called 'insignificant elements.' Once this element is tested, it can always turn into millions of tons of steel and hundreds of millions of people fighting to defend peace. At present, this public opinion is extremely powerful, so Poland and other countries have to join (at least join the voting) in warning Germany. The Soviet Union's support for the resolution of the League of Nations Administrative Council is not out of any hostility towards the German people, but based on its consistent peace policy. If the German government can understand the significance of this warning and understand that all its aggressive steps can only strengthen other countries to take more resolute defensive measures, then it will come to the conclusion that it must create a collective security system in fact, not just in words. This conclusion will be welcomed by the Soviet Union," (TASS dispatch on the 20th).</p>
<h3 id="e50">Russian Ambassador to the US Speech Discusses War Crisis: Once It Erupts, It Will Affect the Whole World, Russia Is Willing to Cooperate with All Countries to Maintain Peace <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>New York News: The Soviet Russian Ambassador to the United States, Mr. Troianovsky, recently gave a speech at a luncheon at the Pond Club in New York, stating that the growth of the war crisis has become increasingly obvious. Even those who do not want to see this crisis cannot pretend not to see it. Perhaps Americans are still hesitating and examining, but those of us who live in dangerous areas already deeply feel the urgency of the situation. I do not believe that anyone with access to information hopes to limit the scope of a new war to Western Europe, Eastern Europe, or Southern Europe. If a future European war occurs, it will definitely not be localized but will become a universal and large war, the largest of all major wars. And because of the continuous invention of new weapons, the barbarity and cruelty of this war will also be unprecedented. Not only soldiers on the battlefield but also civilians far from the battlefield will be attacked by poison gas and from the air. Entire cities and villages will be destroyed. The destruction of resources and the decline of civilization cannot be quantified. It can be declared without hesitation that my Soviet Union is being forced to consider the situation from our special perspective, that is, the force of events has forced us to prepare for the worst. We are prepared to protect the integrity of our country's territory and even the lives and property of our people. Mr. Troianovsky stressed that the Soviet Union does not want war but is willing to cooperate with other countries as much as possible to ensure and consolidate peace. He also said that if the traditional diplomatic methods are not suitable for today's use, then new methods must be sought to maintain peace. In his opinion, even if the governments of various countries cannot guarantee a peaceful outcome for the current crisis, they should at least promise not to provide assistance to countries that provoke aggression. Although this is just empty words, it can also give the "violent troublemakers" the power of sanction. (World Press)</p>

However, Duchov is now encountering major difficulties. He is an old man of seventy years old, with old-fashioned ideas, so he has few comrades.

<p>(Paris) In the future, the various organs in the human body can be filmed and projected on the screen for research. This amazing invention is the result of hard work by French Doctor George. The method is to use several non-arc-shaped lenses, which are combined to form a lens with extraordinary luminosity and equal to the speed of ordinary films (i.e., 16 images per second). It can be used to film the internal organs of the human body. From now on, what doctors can see when examining patients is no longer the static state of the organs but the working state of the organs, which will inevitably be more accurate. For example, the flow of blood in the pulse, the enlargement of the trachea, the contraction of the diaphragm, the operation of the stomach, and the absorption and digestion of food can all be filmed and examined.

<p>Foreign Commentary Agency said, according to Japanese statistics, the comparison of national wealth between China and the great powers is as follows:</p>
<p>Country Total National Wealth (Japanese Yen) Average Wealth Per Capita (Japanese Yen)</p>
<p>United States 762,256,000,000 6,607</p>
<p>United Kingdom 236,320,000,000 5,247</p>

It is extremely shocking. If we do not awaken early, strive for self-improvement, and work hard to promote domestic goods, then this economic decline alone will determine the national crisis.</p>

<p>Re: Letter from the Hebei Post Office Regarding the report in your newspaper's Special Dispatch column on March 27th of this year, which stated that the people's militia resisting orders in Yutian were defeated by the security team. It also stated, "The Yutian Post Office has compiled statistics showing that the security supplementary team stationed in the county extorted property from wealthy households and remitted it abroad, amounting to more than 1,267,000 yuan in the past year. Among them, remittances from Japanese and Korean drug foreign firms accounted for the most, totaling several hundred thousand." We have investigated in detail and found that the Yutian Post Office does not have such statistics. The total amount of remittance business for the entire year of the 23rd was only tens of thousands of yuan, which does not match the situation published in your newspaper. We believe that it is a misrepresentation of rumors and should be corrected to show the facts. We would be very grateful.</p>

<p>Beiping Correspondence: Minister of Railways Gu Mengyu and Director of the Beining Railway Bureau Yin Tong arrived in Ping one after another this morning (20th). Gu came north to recuperate. He took the Shuntian wheel from Shanghai along the sea route north a few days ago. He arrived at Tanggu at 5:00 this morning (20th) and transferred to a special train specially prepared by the Beining Railway Bureau to travel west. He passed Tianjin at 7:40 and arrived at Qinghua Garden Station at 11:00. He transferred to a car and went straight to Huanshan Valley in the Western Hills to rest. In addition to his wife and children and attendants, there were also Shen Chang, Director of the Ping-Sui Railway Bureau, and Zheng Zhao, Deputy Director of the Beining Railway, who accompanied Gu to Ping from Tanggu. Gu did not meet with any visiting guests except for Yin Tong, the Director of the Beining Railway Bureau, whom he met for a brief conversation. Shen Chang, the Director of the Ping-Sui Railway Bureau, told the press at the Railway Bureau at 3:00 this afternoon (20th) about the reason for Gu's trip north, "Minister Gu suffered from insomnia before. After being cured, he was advised by his doctor to rest and recuperate in a different place, so he made this trip north. He does not have any mission. He is scheduled to return to the capital at the beginning of next month to report for duty. On the way back to the capital, he may inspect the railway affairs of various lines." Yin Tong came to Ping to prepare for a sightseeing trip to Japan and to deploy the work of clearing up the "war zone." According to Yin, who told reporters at the East Station waiting room, (1) Chairman Huang (Fu)'s health has recovered and he has gained weight. He may come to the capital at the end of this month or the beginning of next month to take up the post of Minister of Interior. In the future, he plans to travel back and forth between Beiping and Nanjing to take care of the political affairs of both the north and the south. (2) After the replacement of the security team in the "war zone," the issue of command is clearly stipulated in the organizational regulations of the two district commissioners' offices, that is, the commissioners have the power to command the security team, so there is no problem with the commissioners commanding the security team. However, there is no preparation for the establishment of a security command. (3) The issue of the continued existence of the "war zone" clearing committee after the statutory time has expired was not discussed when I met Chairman Huang. Therefore, this matter will be discussed at a plenary meeting of the committee and then reported to the higher authorities for a decision. (4) I will not stay in Ping for long. I am scheduled to go to Tianjin on the 24th and lead specialized personnel from the Railway Bureau out of the pass from Tianjin, passing through Shenyang, Andong, Korea, and other places to Japan to participate in the sightseeing conference of the Japanese Ministry of Railways, which opens on May 2nd. The conference will last for ten days and is scheduled to close on the 12th. After the conference, we will investigate railway administration in Japan and then return to China. (5) I visited the central government officials in the capital and reported on the recent situation in the north. The central government is very clear about the situation in North China and expressed its appreciation for the clearing work in the "war zone." (6) I heard that Minister of Railways Gu came north to recuperate. Because I did not meet Gu in Shanghai, it is difficult for me to answer how long Gu will stay in Ping. (20th)</p>
<h3 id="e75">Security Bureau of Hubei Province Uncovers a Major Embezzlement Case; Section Chief, Division Chief, and Accountant Implicated; Mastermind Yu Taoshen Sentenced to Death <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>Hankou Dispatch: The Security Bureau of Hubei Province discovered a major embezzlement case last year. Section Chief Yu Taoshen was the mastermind, with Division Chief Wang Xuejun and Accountant Zuo Hexuan as accomplices. At the time, Fan Xiji was the director. After the incident came to light, Fan secretly reported to Zhang Qun, Chairman of the Hubei Provincial Government, who then forwarded it to the former Pacification Headquarters of the Three Provinces (Hubei, Henan, Anhui). The headquarters dispatched personnel to jointly investigate the case, while Fan resolutely resigned to show his responsibility. The case has now been investigated and clarified, and the official verdict was announced on the 19th. The details of the case's origin and the judgment are recorded as follows: Initially, Yu Taoshen, a colonel and section chief of the Fourth Section of the bureau, colluded with Division Chief Wang Xuejun and Accountant Zuo Hexuan to embezzle funds. The scheme remained undiscovered for a long time, but rumors spread widely, eventually reaching Director Fan Xiji. However, lacking solid evidence, Fan could only investigate secretly. On the morning of August 11th last year, Yuan Guilin, a service soldier of the bureau, stole 21 packages of military supplies from the repair shop warehouse, including 390 old military blankets, 390 leg wraps, 144 new military hats, and 559 new gray military uniforms. In the afternoon of the same day, he stole another 20 packages of military supplies from the Security Bureau warehouse, including 1,887 new and old bedsheets and 100 sets of new cotton military uniforms with military hats. He transported these items to the Xinyilong Military Uniform Store and deposited them with Zhu Kaixuan. Upon receiving the report, Fan Xiji dispatched soldiers to the store the next morning, recovering all the stolen military supplies and arresting Yuan Guilin. Yuan confessed that he was acting under the orders of Section Chief Yu Taoshen, Division Chief Wang Xuejun, and Accountant Zuo Hexuan. Yu and Zuo immediately fled upon hearing the news, leaving only Wang Xuejun to be arrested. The bureau reported the matter to the provincial government. Zhang Qun, Chairman of the Provincial Government, reported it to the Pacification Headquarters of the Three Provinces. The headquarters, together with the provincial government and the bureau, jointly dispatched personnel to investigate the case. All related parties were summoned for questioning. It was also discovered that in addition to stealing military uniforms, Wang and others had also engaged in the malpractice of withholding equipment and embezzling public funds. The most conclusive evidence was found in two matters: First, in May of the 22nd year of the Republic, an application was submitted to receive five items—canteens, dry food bags, bullet belts, rifle slings, and backpack frames—for the headquarters and various regiments. Yu Taoshen and Zuo Hexuan prepared a preliminary budget, issued false receipts for goods received, and exchanged them for fake receipts from the Xinkang Company military uniform store to claim funds from the treasury, receiving 8,407 yuan and 20 cents. Second, in the case of summer uniforms issued to the headquarters in the 23rd year of the Republic, a preliminary budget was prepared, and receipts from the Xinyilong Military Uniform Store were obtained by Yu Taoshen and Wang Xuejun. Among them, for the item of coarse cloth shoes, the preliminary budget was for 13,346 pairs, but only 3,026 pairs were actually purchased. For the remaining 10,320 pairs, Yu Taoshen and Wang Xuejun issued false receipts for goods received, exchanged them for fake receipts from the Xinyilong Military Uniform Store, and claimed funds from the treasury, receiving 6,708 yuan. For both of these matters, there were no receipts from the headquarters or various regiments, indicating that the items were never manufactured or issued. Yu Taoshen embezzled the funds alone. Other criminal circumstances that were not proven were not considered. Based on these two cases alone, Yu had embezzled over 15,000 yuan, a very serious offense. After collecting evidence and thoroughly investigating the confessions, the judges determined that Yu Taoshen, Wang Xuejun, and Zuo Hexuan had jointly stolen military uniforms, withheld equipment, and embezzled public funds. The evidence was conclusive and undeniable. Yu Taoshen was the mastermind, guilty of both crimes. Therefore, in accordance with the Regulations on Rewards and Punishments for Civil and Military Officials and Soldiers in the Bandit Suppression Area, the Military Criminal Law of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, the Military Trial Law of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, and the Criminal Law, he was sentenced to death. Upon capture, he will be executed by shooting, and all his property will be confiscated to compensate for the losses. Zuo Hexuan and Wang Xuejun were subordinates of Yu, following his orders, and Yu had absconded with the public funds. Their criminal circumstances were deemed deserving of leniency, and their death sentences were reduced by half. Zuo Hexuan was sentenced to 14 years of imprisonment, and Wang Xuejun was sentenced to 12 years of imprisonment, both with deprivation of civil rights for 20 years. The case is now closed. (20th)</p>
<h3 id="e76">Construction Bureau of Anhui Province Organizes Scenic Spots in Caishi; Cui Luo Mountain Developed into a Park; Plum, Bamboo, and Chrysanthemum Planted All Over the Mountain <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>Wuhu Dispatch: Caishi is located in Dangtu County, Anhui Province, close to the capital area and controlling the vital passage of the Yangtze River. Since the construction of the Jing-Wu Highway and the Jing-Wu Railway, transportation has become more convenient. Cui Luo Mountain stands tall by the river, with vast and boundless waters. The morning glow and evening sunset create a magnificent scene. Wild grass grows luxuriantly, and ancient pine trees are lush and verdant, offering excellent scenery and numerous historical sites. The burning of rhinoceros horns by Wen Qiao of the Jin Dynasty and the attempt to capture the moon by Li Bai of the Tang Dynasty are famous stories passed down through generations. The Construction Bureau, recognizing the increasing number of Chinese and foreign tourists visiting by car after the opening of the Jing-Wu Road, has specially ordered the Dangtu County government to enclose Cui Luo Mountain and develop it into Caishi Park to enhance the scenery and preserve historical sites. To save expenses and achieve quick results, a simple design is initially proposed as follows: (1) Transportation A. Roads: The section of Cai Xiang Road from the Caishi Station on the Jing-Wu Road to the entrance of Cai Xiang will be reinforced and leveled, approximately 100 zhang in length, leading directly to Caishi city. The streets within the city, up to the riverside and west to the foot of the mountain, will be demolished and widened to 2 zhang, and the surface will be converted into gravel. B. River Bridge: A wooden bridge with three openings, approximately 10 zhang wide and 4 zhang long by 2 zhang wide, will be built over the river, with earth filling at both ends to ensure unobstructed land and water transportation. C. Ornamental Archways: Concrete archways will be elaborately constructed at the entrance of the bus station and the park's main entrance to enhance the appearance. A wooden archway will be built at the park's rear entrance. D. Street Trees: Street trees will be planted along both sides of the road, using three-year-old new locust trees with protective frames to ensure they grow straight and easily survive. (2) Park Site A. Slopes and Stone Steps: Stone steps will be laid along the route from the park's main entrance to the San Tai Pavilion, through the ancient pine forest, and out of the park's rear entrance. Stone benches and tables will be provided at suitable locations for visitors to rest. Lamp posts will be placed throughout the area for nighttime strolling. B. Sports Ground: A sports ground will be built in the open space to the right of the park's main entrance, equipped with sports equipment. C. Planting Trees: Locust trees will be planted on the northwest side of the mountain, bamboo on the southeast side, tea trees by the river, plum trees on the south side of the mountain, flat grass around the Taibai Tower and the Three Dukes Shrine, chrysanthemums at the lower part of the south side of the mountain, and flowerbeds with various flowers and plants at the southern foot of the mountain. (3) Historical Sites A. Restoration: The San Shan Pavilion, located on the mountain peak with a panoramic view, is now completely gone, with only ancient steles remaining. It is proposed to build a palace-style stele pavilion on the site, retaining the original name. The Moon-Catching Terrace: Caishi is famous for the exiled immortal's attempt to catch the moon. The original site of the terrace is no longer extant. It is decided to build a semi-circular terrace on the original site, with steps leading up from the outside, providing a view of the river. Two rooms will be built below the terrace to provide shelter from wind and rain. B. Preservation: The Tang Taibai Tower has recently been renovated. However, the archway, bed, and other equipment are too few and will be added. Wen Qiao's burning of rhinoceros horns is also well preserved and will be slightly renovated. The ancient Emei Pavilion (i.e., Guanlan Pavilion) was recently built, but the ground is uneven and will be paved with concrete. The Guanyin Pavilion will be slightly renovated. The Sanyuan Cave and Yuxing Hall are still intact. The rugged roads will be repaired to facilitate visitors. (20th)</p>

<p>Dai Jusheng, residing at No. 38 Qingsong Stone, is 38 years old and works at the Jinwannian Flower Shop as a partner. Last August, he married Xu Fuying, a woman from Suzhou who is only 18 years old. She is inherently romantic and dislikes her husband's cautiousness, leading to a strained relationship and extramarital affairs. Her husband discovered her infidelity and repeatedly admonished her, but she refused to change. She frequented Hanzhuang. The other day, Dai discovered that his wife was again at the home of Shi Sheng in Hanzhuang, south of Changqiao, and dragged her home. Unexpectedly, her lover, A, assaulted Dai. Xu also helped with the assault. Dai was no match and fled back home. That evening, the couple quarreled at home. Around midnight, Dai Jusheng suddenly cried out in pain. It turned out that his genitals had been stretched by his wife to nearly a foot in length, causing bleeding. The next day, he went to Dr. Gan for treatment. Initially, he was unable to urinate and suffered unbearable pain. After several days of treatment, he has not fully recovered. This is also a rare and shocking incident.</p>

<p>Jiangzhuang Town in Punan is a sparsely populated commercial area. A public security team was originally stationed there, but it was recently transferred to Shanyang. Consequently, at about 1:00 AM on the 18th, more than ten bandits suddenly arrived in the town, carrying iron shovels, flashlights, and other items. They came from the east and broke into the home of Tan Shouren, owner of the Yiji Nanhua Shop, smashing the south window and entering the inner room. They intimidated the family into silence and ransacked the house. The Tan family was not particularly wealthy. The bandits stole over 30,000 copper coins, clocks, clothes, and other items before escaping. In addition to reporting the case to the Public Security Bureau for investigation, all the shops in the town agreed to go on strike. It is unclear how this will be resolved.</p>
<h3 id="e79">Jiading: Illegally Established Licensing Tax Collection Office <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>Pu Tianqing, from Loutang in this county, used to be a businessman in Shanghai. A few days ago, he returned to Jiading to establish a county tobacco and alcohol licensing tax collection office. He rented Xiao Hanjiang's house in Gu Dian Lane in the city with a guarantee from the Tongmao Gong Flower Shop outside the West Gate. He also borrowed most of the internal equipment from Xiao. He hung up the sign of the tax collection office and prepared to collect taxes. The staff included five or six people, including Wang from Luodian. However, the collection of tobacco and alcohol licensing tax in this county had been handled by the Business Tax Bureau of this county since March 6th, according to an order from the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Finance. Upon hearing this, Bureau Chief Wu Gengyang reported it to the County Public Security Bureau, which ordered the police to arrest Pu and escort him to the county government. During the interrogation, Pu confessed that he was entrusted by Qian Wanzong, a Shanghai resident, to handle the matter. Qian is the director of the county tobacco and alcohol licensing tax collection office and holds an appointment letter issued by Wang Ziliang, the director of the tobacco and alcohol licensing tax bureau of the five counties of Shangbao, Chuanjia, and Tai. He contracted the county tobacco and alcohol licensing tax for 8,500 yuan. Pu paid 150 yuan on behalf of Qian. The county government, considering that the statement seemed to have a basis, temporarily detained Pu and telegraphed the Department of Finance for instructions. On the 19th, a telegram was received from the Department of Finance ordering strict handling of the matter. It is clear that Qian and Pu illegally established the tax collection office. However, it is also heard that the appointment letter held by Qian is not entirely false, but it was issued in early February, when the Department of Finance had not yet ordered the Business Tax Bureau to concurrently collect tobacco and alcohol licensing tax. After Pu Tianqing was detained by the county, the staff in the office dispersed, and all the equipment, except for the borrowed items, was also moved elsewhere. After the county government received the reply from the Department of Finance, the Public Security Bureau again ordered the police to go there. Shen and two others were arrested together. Shen and others said that they saw the office's advertisement in the newspaper recruiting staff, applied, were hired, and paid a deposit. They had only come to Jiading to take office the day before.</p>
<h3 id="e80">Wuxi: Four Rural Temple Fairs Result in Bloody Tragedies <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>The day before yesterday was the 18th day of the third lunar month. The Furong Mountain festival in the fifth district of the county traditionally has a temple fair for morning pilgrimage. Villagers often engage in fighting to be the first to offer incense. The day before yesterday, incense associations from various villages went to the mountain to offer incense as usual. When the incense association from Xi Qi was about to enter the temple to offer incense in front of the Zhang Zhongcheng Temple, the incense association from Kenzhuang Bridge suddenly appeared. A conflict arose due to competition to be the first to offer incense. The thugs and swordsmen from both sides formally engaged in fighting, turning the mountain into a battlefield. The fierce battle lasted about half an hour before it stopped. However, the Xi Qi side suffered more injuries. Three people were seriously injured. One, Zhou Afu, was slashed four times on the top of his head and once on his shoulder, making him the most seriously injured, with his life in danger. Others, such as Zhou Fugen and Chen Baosheng, were also seriously injured. All three were covered in blood, a frightening sight. Also, on the day before yesterday, the combined incense association from Tang Lane and Zhang Lane near Liumenli in the ninth district came to Wuxi to offer incense at the Sanmao Temple on Huishan Mountain. Unexpectedly, the thugs from Zhang Lane planned to set up a boxing ring at the Zhonglie Temple with the swordsmen from Tang Lane to show off their skills, but Tang Lane refused, which angered the thugs from Zhang Lane. They immediately started fighting at the site. As a result, Tang Ronggen, a villager from Tang Lane, was beaten on the head, and blood flowed like a stream. Fortunately, the military police stepped forward to suppress the situation, and a tragedy was averted. Furthermore, a grand temple fair was held at Bashiqiao in Beixiang on the day before yesterday. The Public Security Bureau dispatched a mobile patrol team to the countryside to suppress the situation. Unexpectedly, when passing through Yandai Town, patrolman Song Tingbi was arguing due to the narrow road when suddenly a person punched Song's right ribs twice. Song felt dizzy and vomited blood twice. The team arrested the assailant, Zhu Genda, who has been taken to the bureau for interrogation. In addition, Madam Xi Fan, an old woman from Xinglong Bridge in the city, was watching the Sibao Bridge incense association at the West Gate the day before yesterday. Unexpectedly, due to the crowd, she was pushed off the city wall, causing a hole in the top of her head more than four inches deep. She lost consciousness due to heavy bleeding. Although she was treated at the hospital, her life is still in critical condition.</p>
<h3 id="e81">Ordering Japanese Silkworm Eggs to Relieve the Silkworm Market <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>During this spring silkworm egg season, various fields in Jiangsu Province produced a total of more than 1.1 million sheets. Generally, silkworm egg merchants have been importing silkworm eggs into Zhejiang Province for sale, with a total of more than 500,000 sheets. Only more than 600,000 sheets remain in this province, resulting in supply falling short of demand. The silkworm mulberry model districts in various counties have established current sales offices at three locations, including the Wuxi Hotel, since the 6th of this month. Since the beginning of sales, the villagers who purchase silkworm eggs have been extremely crowded. As of 12:00 noon yesterday, all of the supply was completely sold out. However, those who arrived later were still extremely enthusiastic but felt disappointed. The deputy director of the model district, Zhou Yuanxun, considering the panic caused by the shortage of eggs, consulted with Tang Xixiang, the director of the Provincial Silkworm Silk Experiment Field, on relief measures. It was decided to purchase silkworm eggs from Japan to meet the emergency needs. After urgently telegraphing the province for approval, he quickly telegraphed Shanghai to contact the Japanese silkworm egg merchant, Jinzi. Jinzi immediately telegraphed his country to notify them to prepare for delivery and came to Wuxi last night to discuss everything with Deputy Director Zhou in person. It is reported that the price is one yuan per sheet, but the model district sells them to farmers for only forty cents per sheet. According to Deputy Director Zhou, the shortage of eggs in Jiangsu Province is not limited to Wuxi County. Counties along the Jing-Hu area also need to supplement their supply. Therefore, the quantity ordered from Japan has not yet been determined. Currently, it is temporarily assumed to be 100,000 sheets. The Japanese side has already replied to Shanghai. 3,000 sheets are expected to arrive tonight (the 22nd) to meet the market's needs.</p>

<p>The Zhou Shen Temple in Lian Tangluo Township in the third district traditionally holds a temple fair in mid-March. The temple fair was held again on the 19th of this month, with all kinds of ceremonial guards. Therefore, the nearby villagers flocked there. Both vendors and ferry boats made ten times their usual profit. At about 2:00 PM, the villagers were very crowded. There is a ferry crossing there. Pedestrians must usually be ferried across. At that time, there were many male and female passengers on the ferry, including many young women. Some frivolous people were joking around in the boat. Due to uneven seating, the boat suddenly capsized. Fortunately, most of the men and women in the boat were familiar with swimming, and either swam ashore themselves or were rescued. Zhang Shigen's wife, Zhang, and a five-year-old girl drowned and died because they sank to the bottom of the river and could not be rescued in time.</p>
<h3 id="e83">Jiaxing: Large Gangs of Silkworm Raising in the Four Rural Areas <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>Silkworm farming in the four rural areas of Jiaxing has begun. The various silkworm industry guidance centers have already started to promote the germination of silkworm eggs. On the 19th and 20th, they distributed the silkworm eggs. A total of more than 96,000 sheets of silkworm eggs were distributed in the county. However, in the four rural areas, due to the private transportation of silkworm eggs out of the area, the silkworm eggs were sold to farmers at a reduced price, causing disputes. In the fifth district, most of the villagers were unable to purchase silkworm eggs for silkworm farming due to the severe drought last year. Therefore, fewer silkworm eggs were distributed. It is learned that after the villagers received the silkworm eggs, they started to harvest silkworm ants in large gangs on the 10th and 11th. Because the mulberry trees are very sparsely leafy, and the leaves are quite thin and the moisture content is normal, it is expected that the price of leaves will inevitably rise sharply in the future.</p>
<h3 id="e84">Stage Play Crushes Six People to Death <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>In Shengjia Township, where Jiaxing's northern rural area borders the Jiangsu Province, rural residents recently pooled their resources to organize a three-day spring opera performance starting on the 19th. The 21st was the last day of the opera performance. When the performance started in the afternoon, due to the crowd, some of the audience climbed onto the artificial rocks next to the stage to watch. As the artificial rocks had been piled up for a long time, the lower part was loose. At about 3:00 PM, when the gongs and drums were sounding, the artificial rocks suddenly collapsed, and the audience fled in panic. Several people were unable to escape and were crushed by the rocks. It is reported that six people were crushed to death, and many others were injured. After the incident, the opera performance was stopped immediately. The deceased were in a terrible state.</p>
<h3 id="e85">Jintan: Chen Kunshan Steals Electricity and Commits Assault <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>At 8:00 PM on the 15th of this month, Wang Xiaotong, an inspector of the Yili Electric Company in this county, and Wang Kouzi, a lamp installer, went out to check the lamps. While passing through Ximen Town, they found that Chen Kunshan's family had illegally installed electric lights. They immediately reported it to the First Substation of the Public Security Bureau nearby. The patrol chief, Yang Renlin, led a policeman to the scene together. Wang Kouzi was in the process of removing the illegally installed lights and handing them over to Chief Yang as evidence. Unexpectedly, Chen Kunshan suddenly led a group of security team members to the scene, forcibly took back the electric lights, and after beating Wang Xiaotong and Wang Kouzi, dragged them to the sub-team department outside the West Gate and hung them up and beat them for several hours before releasing them. At that time, Wang and others could not move. After the company was notified, they sent someone to take Wang and others to the public hospital for treatment. It is reported that Wang Jianzhong, the manager of the company, has filed a criminal lawsuit with the county government and plans to telegraph the Electrical Enterprise Federation and other groups to request assistance to achieve the purpose of punishing the perpetrators and obtaining compensation.</p>
<h3 id="e86">Zhenjiang: Jiangsu Anti-Smoking Association Establishes Factory <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>At the regular meeting of the Jiangsu Provincial Anti-Smoking Committee on the afternoon of the 20th, only three members, Ye Xiufeng, Leng Yuqiu, and Xiang Zhizhuang, attended. A discussion meeting was temporarily convened, and many cases were discussed. Only a few decisions were tentatively made, and the rest were left for discussion at the next meeting. One decision was to establish a tobacco factory for smokers in the Nantong district. Leng Yuqiu reviewed the plan and submitted it to the meeting for discussion. The Provincial Anti-Smoking Association has now allocated 3,000 yuan as the factory's start-up expenses. The provincial association will also establish a canned food factory for smokers in the near future. The machines for manufacturing canned food can also be used to manufacture gas masks and other supplies. Its function can take care of both periods. Furthermore, to promote anti-smoking propaganda, the association plans to publish two publications: the Anti-Smoking Yearbook and the Anti-Smoking Newsletter. Both will be implemented at the beginning of the next year. The film script solicited by the association in the past has now received more than thirty pieces. Chairman Chen is very interested in this and has submitted it to the association for review. It will be transferred to the Central Propaganda Committee for selection. Because film scripts are different from ordinary scripts, the cinematography, scenery, economic factors, and time aspects must be considered. The Central Propaganda Committee has sufficient personnel for this and the selection is more meticulous.</p>
<h3 id="e87">Taixian: Lawsuit on Additional Taxes for Guiding the Huai River <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>In the Jiangsu Province's effort to guide the Huai River, the counties in the Huai River region collect labor, and the province subsidizes the workers' wages. However, many counties have added additional land taxes or collected per-mu donations to fund expenses related to guiding the Huai River. Huang Tong, from the Louzhuang Township Farmers' Association in Taixian County, previously filed a separate petition with the central government's relevant departments, requesting the revocation of the additional taxes imposed by the provincial government for guiding the Huai River and the illegal collection of per-mu donations by Zhang Yi, the magistrate of Taixian County, for the same purpose, and requesting that the county magistrate and others be handed over to the competent authorities for disciplinary action. This case has been repeatedly instructed by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, first ordering the relevant official departments to review the matter, and then ordering the Jiangsu Provincial Government to review and handle it. It is learned that Huang Tong continued to submit new evidence on March 20th of this year, presenting it to Premier Wang Chonghui of the Executive Yuan and Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, concurrently chairman of the Guiding the Huai River Committee, for review. Both replies were received on the 12th of this month. (1) The Executive Yuan replied, "The submission is noted. As the matter concerns the Guiding the Huai River project, since it has been submitted separately, please wait patiently for the Guiding the Huai River Committee to review and handle it." (2) The Military Committee Chairman's Headquarters replied, "The submission and attachments are noted. Please order the Jiangsu Provincial Government to investigate and handle it."</p>
<p>Special Report</p>
<h3 id="e88">Investigation into the Circulation of Subsidiary Coins in Gansu (Continued) <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>— Zhu Jingzhou</p>
<p>(C) Exchange Rates of Common Copper Coins in Various Counties</p>
<p>The exchange rates of common copper coins vary across counties due to differing local conditions. For instance, in Jingtai County, one silver dollar can be exchanged for 5 strings of cash; in Jingyuan County, for 5 strings and 200 cash; in Gulang, Xiahe, Anxi, Minqin, and Pingliang counties, for 5 strings and 500 cash; in Wuwei County, for 5 strings and 800 cash; in Linxia, Yongdeng, Taosha, Yongjing, Lintan, Hezheng, Shandan, Yumen, Dunhuang, Yongchang, Gaolan, Dingxin, and Jiuquan counties, for 6 strings; in Ningding and Lintao counties, for 6 strings and 200 cash; in Zhangye, Minle, Haiyuan, Gaotai, and Jingning counties, for 6 strings and 500 cash; in Zhang County, Gangu, Huating, Huan County, Yuzhong, Huining, Tianshui, Wudu, Huixian, Min County, Liangdang, and Weiyuan counties, for 7 strings; in Wushan and Qingshui counties, for 7 strings and 300 cash; in Li County, for 7 strings and 400 cash; in Dingxi, Longde, Zhuanglang, Qingyang, Zhenyuan, Tongwei, Cheng County, and Longxi counties, for 7 strings and 500 cash; in Jingchuan County, for 7 strings and 750 cash; in Qin'an County, for 7 strings and 800 cash; in Huaping, Chongxin, and Kang County, for 8 strings; in Xihe County, for 8 strings and 200 cash; in Lingtai County, for 8 strings and 400 cash; and in Xigu, for 8 strings and 780 cash. Observing the varying exchange rates across counties, Jingtai County's 5 strings are the most expensive, while Xigu County's 8 strings and 780 cash are the cheapest. The difference between the two is 3 strings and 780 cash. The fact that such a phenomenon exists within the same province not only fully demonstrates the disorder of the monetary system and the obstruction of transportation but also provides an overview of the situation. What is even worse is that within the same county, copper coins may be commonly used in area A but not in area B, and vice versa. Min County is one example of this.</p>
<p>(D) Origin of Copper Coins in Various Counties</p>
<p>Regarding the origin of copper coins in various counties, except for 21 counties that did not report, the following is based on the 41 counties that did report. Among them, the most come from Sichuan, such as in Dingxi, Zhang County, Qingshui, Gangu, Lintao, Zhuanglang, Xihe, Wushan, Longxi, Huining, Wen County, Kang County, Wudu, Huixian, Qin'an, Min County, Xigu, Li County, Lingtai, Liangdang, and Cheng County. Those from the provincial capital and neighboring counties include Linxia, Wuwei, Xiahe, Lintan, Longde, Huaping, Jingtai, and Tongwei. Those from both Sichuan and the provincial capital include Jingchuan, Huating, Haiyuan, Huan County, Chongxin, Tianshui, Zhenyuan, and Li County. Jingning County receives its copper coins from the southeast, while Jingyuan and Pingliang counties receive theirs from Shaanxi. Yumen County receives its copper coins from Baotou and Suiyuan. In Sichuan Province, each defense zone freely mints coins, resulting in inferior coins worth 50, 100, or 200 cash flooding the market. Consequently, they have to rely on neighboring provinces as outlets. Longnan, which borders Sichuan, is the most severely affected.</p>
<p>(E) Copper Coin Notes and Cash Notes</p>
<p>Copper coin notes are circulated only in 10 counties: Taosha, Wuwei, Zhangye, Longde, Qingshui, Pingliang, Tianshui, Zhenyuan, Gaolan, and Cheng County. Except for Pingliang, which also uses copper coin notes from the Shaanxi Provincial Bank, the rest are issued by the Gansu Ping City Official Branch. The face value is mostly 10 coins, priced at 4 strings of cash per silver dollar. Since the provincial treasury has no intention of using this to supplement its funds, the amount issued is always determined by the market demand. With sufficient reserves and established credit, their exchange rate can even exceed that of the base currency they represent – copper coins. This is a unique phenomenon in Gansu Province and is unmatched by any other province. As for money shops and businesses issuing similar promissory notes, there have been no reports of such. The finances of various counties in Gansu are exhausted, and except for a few larger county towns, there is no organization of silver and money shops. Therefore, domestic remittances are extremely difficult, which is one of the reasons for the sluggishness of commerce. In the entire province, only Tian Shun Dang, Quan De Tang, Zhong Yi Hou, Wan Qing Cheng, and other shops in Jiuquan County issue oilcloth cash notes similar to promissory notes, totaling about 14,600 strings, circulating in the market. It is unknown when these originated, as there is no mention of it, making it impossible to speculate. Generally, the county is located in a remote western area, and funds are often insufficient. These cash notes were created in response to this need. However, their credit is still good, and the number issued is small. Once reorganized, there will be no problems. Although transactions in various counties in Gansu are still mostly based on cash as the unit, as a result of years of purchasing and recasting, cash coins have almost disappeared. Only in Minqin, Dingxin, Yongchang and other counties are some still used for small change. (3) Conclusion: In summary, the monetary evolution of Gansu Province is still stuck at the copper coin standard stage. There are two reasons for this: (1) Transportation in Gansu is inconvenient, the economy is backward, and monetary credit is not yet fully developed. In places like Dunhuang, there are still commercial systems of barter trading goods for goods. (2) People's lives are simple, and the amount of transactions is not large. The circulation of copper coins is most suitable for their economic background. Since copper coins are the center of transactions among various social groups in Gansu, once their price drops, it always causes prices to rise, and its impact on the livelihood of ordinary poor people is not insignificant, especially for those who run small businesses. Therefore, in terms of unifying the monetary policy, it is necessary to reorganize it, and in terms of the livelihood of ordinary people, it must be reorganized as soon as possible. However, once reorganized, the price of copper coins will inevitably rise, and copper coins from neighboring provinces will take advantage of the situation to enter. Where there is great profit, people will compete to go there, and even with strict laws and harsh punishments, it may not be possible to manage the aftermath well. This is why they hesitate all day long, thinking carefully but unable to find a solution. In short, currency is based on the nation as the unit, and it is not something that one province can do alone. Gansu Province only does its best within the possible range. As for unifying and standardizing it, so as to be on par with advanced and civilized countries, this is what they deeply hope from the central government. Fortunately, the Currency System Committee has already been established. Will there be a day when the complex, intricate, and bizarre problem of Chinese subsidiary coins will be resolved? They look forward to it. (Attached table omitted)</p>

<p>Business Report</p>
<p>The bank has been established for four years in an instant since its opening. At the beginning of its establishment, it coincided with the Shanghai Incident. The city's industry and commerce suffered a severe blow, and its vitality was depleted. By last year, the rural economy had already been declining. In addition, the implementation of the US silver policy and the depreciation of currencies in various countries caused China's finances to experience an unprecedented panic. There were financial storms in the silver and money industry, and there were those who were liquidated and went bankrupt. The severity of the situation was unprecedented in recent years. The silver and money industry is the hub of the re-industry. Since all industries are declining and depressed, finance is naturally stagnant and exhausted, which is a matter of course affecting the silver and money industry. The bank has always maintained a steady attitude, seeking progress in gradual progress and survival in panic. All business is based on prudence. Therefore, in the midst of the financial world's stormy seas, the bank is still at ease. This is naturally due to the faith of the society, but also to the efforts of the bank's shareholders to maintain and support it, making the bank's foundation solid. Now, the difficult pass has been overcome, and the business is getting better and better. This can be said to the shareholders in two aspects: one is the business situation of each branch, and the other is the various facilities that the bank is currently carrying out. Please allow me to briefly explain to the shareholders: (1) Business situation of each branch: The Hangzhou branch of the bank was established after the resolution of the fifth board of directors of the bank in the province. It has been reported to the previous general meeting of shareholders. After five months of preparation, it officially opened on April 16, 23 years. Last year, the actual business hours were only eight and a half months. After opening, Zhejiang Province encountered a drought unprecedented in 60 years, and the remnants of bandits in Anhui and Jiangxi repeatedly disturbed the border of Zhejiang. The general commerce of Hangzhou City became more and more depressed. Small and medium-sized shops often closed down. Even those with a long history and a good reputation were closed down and liquidated due to the weakness of the people's purchasing power and the stagnation of the accounts on the upper reaches of the Yangtze River. The silk, tea, paper, and foil and other major products were also lifeless due to poor sales. In the general decline of industry and commerce, the Hangzhou branch has been progressing smoothly with the sincere cooperation of all sectors of the local community. In eight and a half months, the deposits received have reached about 800,000 yuan, and the total amount of receipts and payments has also exceeded 35.7 million yuan. The average daily balance of various deposits in the business department is 535,333 yuan. In the future, it will naturally carefully consider the business environment and the actual needs of various industries to properly handle each also. The Nanshi branch of the bank is a part of the former site of the Nanshi Chamber of Commerce, which was rented and repaired. It opened on March 21 last year. In the past year, it has received more than 160,000 yuan in various deposits. In the future, the number of people in Huhang who have a relationship with the bank will increase day by day. The Baxianqiao branch of the bank was established in mid-October of the 22nd year. It is the first branch established by the bank. The residents and shops in the area are very prosperous, and the business can be developed. However, since the Baxianqiao area is the center of concentration for various banks to establish branches, business competition is inevitable, and progress is difficult to achieve quickly. Various savings deposits have reached more than 130,000 yuan. The western district of the city has always been known as a residential area. Banking peers have successively set up branches in the Jing'an Temple Road area. At first, the bank did not have a suitable location, so it was still empty. Last November, the Western District Branch of the Four Banks Savings Association moved to a new house after its completion. The bank rented it because it was located between Jing'an Temple Road and Carter Road, which is convenient for transportation. It announced its opening on November 20. Although it has been a short time, the business is still smooth, and it is very promising. The bank has always paid close attention to the business of other places. Since the opening of the Hangzhou branch, it has made every effort to promote the business in Zhejiang Province. Shaoxing is the old capital of eastern Zhejiang, and its commerce has always been prosperous. In the past ten years, wars and disasters have continued in various provinces, rural areas have gone bankrupt, and people have no means of livelihood. Shaoxing is located in the east of Zhejiang, far from the center, and there are few soldiers. Residents have settled in their respective industries, producing silk and wine, which are sold at home and abroad. The amount is quite large, and the folk customs are simple, hardworking, and patient, which is a feature. Therefore, in this time of worldwide recession, the people are generally rich. The only rich county is Shaoxing. Therefore, the bank decided to set up a branch there and found a site in Shuicheng Lane. The sixth meeting of the second board of directors decided to hire Xu Shengyang as manager. It opened on March 2, 2016. Although the business is not yet a month, it has gained considerable credibility, and the future outlook can be predicted. (2) Facilities under construction: The bank has been handling businesses of a trust nature for a long time, and it has gradually become developed, such as the securities department's buying and selling securities on behalf of customers, the warehouse department's depositing goods, the safe deposit box department's renting safe deposit boxes, and the real estate department's renting houses. In addition, it has signed an insurance special agreement with Tianyi Insurance Company to manage insurance on behalf of customers, etc. These are all aspects of the development of the wood industry. It is now planned to establish a trust department to be solely responsible for handling all trust businesses, so as to achieve the effect of managing simple matters easily. Furthermore, the bank is aware that the market in the Hongkou area is gradually becoming prosperous, and is currently planning to set up a Hongkou branch to assist in the arms and fingers. In addition to working hard to promote various businesses, the bank has never forgotten to run social undertakings. Recently, in view of the increasingly large and complex economic organizations, laws, and personnel in the society, a general department has been specially created to provide consultation and research for all sectors. The scope of this consultation is temporarily divided into (1) academics, (2) economics, (3) law, and (4) personnel, and experts are invited to serve as special contracted instructors. At the same time, a monthly publication, tentatively named "Silk Weaving," will be published to selectively disclose the answers to various consultations and other valuable works. All of these facilities are intended to serve the society. In short, "seeking credit with service" and "seeking pure profit with credit" are the bank's only creeds. In the future, it will naturally strive to live up to the elegant expectations of all shareholders.</p>
<h3 id="e96">New Life Service Corps: Yesterday's Service Conditions: Station and Wharf Order Changes Drastically from the Past <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday was a regular Sunday holiday. Most organizations and schools were closed. The members of the Shanghai New Life Youth Service Corps, mostly students and employed individuals, took advantage of this holiday to gather and set off to work. Yesterday's service focus was on stations and wharves. Therefore, in addition to guiding people along the roads, the corps members paid close attention to the stations and wharves. Yesterday, the "National News Agency" reporter went to Xieqiao, Nanyangqiao, South Railway Station, North Railway Station, and the Guanzhao area of the South City, as well as wharves such as Pentangqiao on the Suzhou River, to inspect. It was observed that in Nanyangqiao and Xieqiao, adult corps members wearing white armbands were assisting traffic police in directing traffic. Police persuasion teams were also patrolling the roads, holding white flags for guidance. At the South and North Railway Stations, there were both student guards and ordinary corps members, who were guiding arriving and departing passengers and maintaining order. At the steamboat wharves, corps members were also directing passengers getting on and off. What most caught the attention of the general public was the white armbands of the corps members, which were very striking. Therefore, the public had a deep impression of them. The previously chaotic order of the steamboat wharves was drastically changed through the efforts of the corps members in maintaining service. This shows that the public not only has awareness of the New Life Movement, but also is able to accept and implement it.</p>

<p>Zhabei: The Wuzhen Road Police Station of the Xinzha Sub-bureau held a New Life Movement conference at the Anle Theater in the local small vegetable market at 10:00 AM yesterday. Approximately 1,000 people attended, including Ruan Kaiji, the head of the Xinzha Sub-bureau, patrol officers Luo Siwei, police chiefs Liu Jinling, Hu Yao, Wu Dengxin, and male and female residents. After performing the rituals, Sub-bureau Chief Ruan first reported on the purpose of the meeting and explained the meaning of the "propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame" principles, encouraging the public to carry out a life revolution, which was very detailed. Then, a guest raised an objection to placing trash cans indoors, arguing that as the weather gradually warms, it would be detrimental to hygiene and inconsistent with the New Life Movement. He requested the reactivation of the old garbage bins in the alleyways. In addition, waste collectors issued notices demanding a tip of one dime per night pot per month, threatening to refuse to empty the night pots otherwise. He requested that the authorities find a way to stop this. Sub-bureau Chief Ruan replied that the reactivation of old garbage bins in the alleyways was a comprehensive issue that required a formal request to be submitted to higher authorities for approval. Until approval from above was obtained, the old system would continue to be used. As for the issue of waste collectors demanding tips, the hygiene and public safety bureaus had previously issued announcements prohibiting this. In the future, if such incidents were discovered, whether reported to the police or apprehended by citizens themselves, they would be investigated and punished. Finally, Patrol Officer Luo and others delivered speeches, and the meeting adjourned.</p>
<p>Pudong: A preparatory meeting for the Cleanliness Campaign was held at the Pudong YMCA at 2:00 PM on April 18th. Representatives from organizations, including Shen Yu, Zhang Wuqin, Cao Hanwu, Yao Songyu, Yu Yue, Chuan Qinghuai, Zhang Qinggen, and Tu Shuren, totaling eight people, attended. At the time, Zhang Qinggen was elected chairman by the attendees, and Tu Shuren served as the secretary. After the chairman reported, various proposals were discussed and the meeting adjourned.</p>
<h3 id="e98">Amidst the Economic Downturn: Yongxingzhuang Ceases Business Yesterday; Has Entrusted a Lawyer to Announce Liquidation <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, another new example of the economic downturn in this city occurred yesterday, namely the Yongxing Huihua Zhuang at No. 11 Xingren Lane, 120 Ningbo Road, which also ceased business. As the end of April closing period is approaching, this phenomenon was also expected. The Central News Agency reporter learned of the following details yesterday:</p>
<p>History of Establishment</p>
<p>Yongxingzhuang was established in February of the 20th year of the Republic of China, with a capital of 300,000 yuan, divided into ten shares. The shareholders were Chen Dizhou (three shares), Yu Zhendong (two and a half shares), Guo Ruoyu (two shares), Chen Zhongchi (one and a half shares), and Chen Meibai (one share). The manager was Chen Jingtao, the assistant manager was Wang Hanqing, and the assistant manager was Chen Dizhou. The business involved remittances and loans. Although it was not established for long, its creditworthiness was quite remarkable.</p>
<p>Announcement of Liquidation</p>
<p>The previous night, due to the failure to deliver 70,000 yuan in remittances, it was forced to announce its closure at 10:00 PM that night. From yesterday morning, it did not open for business. Manager Chen Jingtao entrusted lawyer Xu Zuyan to announce liquidation. Important staff members have not been going to the Zhuang to work since that day. Only a few trainees remained inside to take care of things.</p>
<p>Reasons for Closure</p>
<p>The Central News Agency reporter interviewed Xu Zuyan, the liquidator of the Zhuang, yesterday. According to him, the Zhuang's accounts have been mostly reviewed. In addition to the capital of 300,000 yuan, there were over 900,000 yuan in deposits and 700,000-800,000 yuan in loans. Assets and liabilities are roughly equal. The reason for the forced closure this time is nothing more than the impact of the economic downturn. Yongxingzhuang invested heavily in real estate mortgages. Some mortgages have expired and been taken over by the Zhuang, but they cannot be sold, leading to stagnation. However, the losses to creditors should not be too significant, only a matter of time. As for the question of whether it can resume business, a Qianzhuang is not comparable to a bank. Its establishment relies solely on credit. Once it closes, it is difficult to have hope of recovery.</p>
<p>Lawyer's Notice</p>
<p>Lawyer Xu Zuyan, representing Yongxing Qianzhuang, announced a liquidation notice, stating: "According to the agent of Yongxing Qianzhuang, the Zhuang has been affected by the sluggish market, resulting in poor turnover, and has had to suspend business and announce liquidation. Please make a public announcement, handle registration procedures, and recover outstanding debts. Therefore, this announcement is made on behalf of the agent. All creditors of the Zhuang must, within fourteen days from today, register at this firm with their debt instruments. All debtors must also pay off their debts in full within the above-mentioned period. Failure to do so will result in legal action. Do not delay. Lawyer Xu Zuyan, April 21st, 24th year of the Republic of China, Office: Room 406, Xingye Building, Beijing Road Intersection, Shanghai, Telephone: 19074."</p>

<h3 id="e101">Art Exhibition: Preview Day 14 <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday (the 21st) was the 14th day of the Shanghai preview of the International Exhibition of Chinese Art in London. Since its opening, it has been two weeks, and the average daily number of visitors has been around 2,000. Yesterday was a Sunday, a regular holiday for various organizations, so the number of visitors was even more crowded. The entrance to the venue was bustling with activity. Here is a summary of the news obtained yesterday:</p>
<p>Visits by Celebrities in Recent Days</p>
<p>In the past two days, celebrities who visited the exhibition included Cai Yuanpei, President of the Academia Sinica; Chu Minyi, Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan; Xu Beihong, professor and artist of Central University; Li Ximou, Dean of Studies of Jinan University; He DeKui, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Council. Hu Shi, Dean of the Faculty of Arts of Peking University, will also visit the exhibition with American educator Paul Monroe. Recently, a delegation from an American economic survey group also intends to visit the exhibition.</p>
<p>More Antiquities Arrive</p>
<p>A total of 100 pieces of Yin oracle bones, stone knives, stone axes, bronze molds, ivory carvings, etc., previously sent by the Academia Sinica for exhibition, have been displayed in the seventh room. However, the Academia Sinica plans to send more of these antiquities. It is said that they will arrive next Wednesday (the 24th).</p>
<p>Trends in the Evolution of Painting</p>
<p>The second chapter of the explanation of calligraphy and painting written by the exhibition, "The Evolution of Calligraphy and its Masters," was published in yesterday's newspaper. Here is the third chapter, "The Lack of Evolution of Calligraphy and its Learning," and its famous scholars, continued for reference by those who study calligraphy and painting. To the utmost of learning's complexity, it is divided into three categories: landscape, figures, and sketches, and explained as follows: (1) Specializing in landscape painting originated in the Six Dynasties and flourished in the Tang Dynasty. For convenience of explanation, it can be divided into the Northern and Southern Schools. The Southern School takes gentleness to capture charm, gaining ethereal spirit from the tangible, emphasizing brushwork. The Northern School takes strength to capture momentum, revealing real power from the intangible, emphasizing the use of condensation. Wang Wei is regarded as the ancestor of the Southern School, with Yang Sheng and Lu Hong of the Tang Dynasty, Jing Hao, Guan Quan, Dong Yuan, and Ju Ran of the Five Dynasties, Li Cheng, Fan Kuan, Hui Chong, Yan Wengui, Xu Daoning, Guo Xi, Zhao Danian, Mi Fu, Jiang Can, Mi Youren of the Song Dynasty, Zhao Mengfu, Qian Xuan, Gao Kegong, Huang Gongwang, Cao Zhibai, Wu Zhen, Wang Meng, Ni Zan, Sheng Mao, Zhu Derun, Tang Di, Chen Ruyan, and Xu Ben of the Yuan Dynasty, Wang Hong, Liu Yu, Shen Zhou, Wen Zhengming, and Dong Qichang of the Ming Dynasty, and Wang Shimin, Wang Jian, Wang Hui, Wang Yuanqi, Wu Li, Yun Shouping, Shi Xi, Shi Tao, Bada Shanren, Emperor Gaozong, Tang Yifen, and Dai Xi of the Qing Dynasty inheriting the Dharma milk, without interruption for over a thousand years. Northern School landscapes often combine figures and buildings, with both meticulous and raw styles. Li Sixun and Li Zhaodao of the Tang Dynasty, known as the Big and Small Generals Li, are their representatives. The meticulous style of the Northern School includes Wang Xi, Zhao Zonghan, Zhao Boju, Zhao Boxiu, and Liu Songnian of the Song Dynasty, Ge Ziping, Wang Zhenpeng of the Yuan Dynasty, and Qiu Ying and Wu Bin of the Ming Dynasty as one line. The raw style includes Li Tang, Zhu Rui, Ma Yuan, and Xia Gui of the Song Dynasty, Liu Guandao of the Yuan Dynasty, and Dai Jin, Kai Chen, Tang Yin, and Lan Ying of the Ming Dynasty as one line. Early Qing painting styles still followed the late Ming style, such as Wang Duo, Zai Mingshuo, Fu Shan, and Fa Ruozhen, who were all close to the Northern School. These two schools sometimes mixed with each other and were not strictly divided. Observers should be good at distinguishing them. (2) Figure painting probably began in the Han Dynasty, continued through the Six Dynasties, and was slightly influenced by foreign influences. The works handed down from the Tang Dynasty are more reliable. Yan Liben, Wu Daozi, the Big and Small Weichi, and Zhou Fang of the Tang Dynasty, Zhou Wenju and Qiu Wenbo of the Five Dynasties, Shi Ke, Chao Guangjiu, Li Boshi, Su Hanchen, Ma Hezhi, Zhang Zeduan, Jia Shigu, Liang Kai, and Li Song of the Song Dynasty, Zhao Mengfu, Zhao Yong, Zhao Yanzheng, and the Zu Sun family of the Yuan Dynasty, and Wu Wei, Guo Xu, Du Jin, Tang Yin, Qiu Ying, Ding Yunpeng, and Cui Zizhong of the Ming Dynasty, and Chen Hongshou, Zhang Feng, Hua Yan, and Gai Qi of the Qing Dynasty, either wrote facts or captured charm, combining meticulous and freehand styles, each with their own strengths. (3) For sketches, Han Gan, Dai Song, Han Huang, Bian Luan, and Diao Guangyin of the Tang Dynasty, Xu Xi, Huang Quan, and Teng Changyou of the Five Dynasties, and Huang Quan's son Ju Cai, Xu Xi's grandson Chongsi, each with their own family traditions, Zhao Chang, Cui Bai, Ai Xuan, Wu Yuanyu, Lin Chun, Wu Bingli, Di, and Ma Lin of the Song Dynasty, Lu Zonggui, Xiao Rong of the Liao Dynasty, Qian Xuan, Wang Yuanming, Emperor Xuanzong of the Ming Dynasty, Lin Liang, Lu Ji, Lu Zhi, Chen Daofu, Wang Guxiang, Xu Wei, Zhou Zhimian, and Chen Kuo of the Ming Dynasty, and Yun Shouping, Wang Wu, Jin Nong, Jiang Tingxi, and Zou Yigui of the Qing Dynasty all had their own specialties. This school of painting, in its meticulousness, still possesses charm. Its coloring and transmission of colors are extremely refined. Among them, there is also a freehand style, which is good at using reduced brushstrokes, with few strokes but sufficient expression, not flowing into wildness, far surpassing general court books that only imitate.</p>

<p>The Shanghai City Solicitation Team Headquarters of the China Aviation Association received a letter from Zhang Jitang, captain of Team 168, requesting the appointment of Xin Zhouxiang as deputy captain of the team. Lu Jingmei, captain of Team 315, requested the appointment of Xu Xingsan and Hua Mingsheng as deputy captains of the team. Yu Songchu, captain of Team 377, requested the appointment of Dai Yuheng, Wang Zhipang, Zheng Shixu, and Cai Beiquan as deputy captains. Jin Runxiang of Team 233 requested the appointment of Liu Gui and Sun Dingyang as deputy captains. The headquarters has approved the appointments and issued letters of appointment to assist in the solicitation work.</p>
<p>Zhang Zhuping, the general manager of the Shishi Xinbao and Dalu Bao newspapers, has been dedicated to social and cultural undertakings for over twenty years, and is particularly enthusiastic about the national salvation movement. During the first solicitation campaign, he was appointed as the captain of Solicitation Team 81, and his performance was very impressive. This time, he was reappointed as the captain of Team 61, and his solicitation work is very diligent. This year marks his 50th birthday. Friends and acquaintances wanted to celebrate his birthday, but he declined. He wished to donate all birthday gifts to the aviation national salvation fund to express his patriotic enthusiasm. The headquarters highly praised this move and is said to have sent a letter of thanks. After the headquarters started the solicitation work, it appointed more than 400 leaders from all walks of life as captains of the solicitation teams, who worked hard to solicit members and raise donations for aviation national salvation. It is said that Rong Hongsan and Weng Yangwu have also been appointed as captains, and letters of appointment and various solicitation documents have been sent to them, asking them to work hard. In addition, the headquarters received 312 yuan in membership fees from Zhang Jitang, captain of Team 168, and 104 yuan from Li Yuanshan, captain of Team 324, yesterday.</p>

<p>The Shanghai National Goods Movement to Aid Disaster Relief Conference, initiated by the Jiaxu All-Zhejiang Disaster Relief Association and the China National Products Manufacturers Association, has been actively preparing and is now ready. The conference has decided to officially open on the 26th of this month, with no further delays, and has scheduled the first representative conference for today. In addition to discussing important proposals, the conference will also decide to draw lots to reserve venue locations. Because of the large number of participating manufacturers, the conference has decided to use venue fee receipts as the standard for drawing lots, in order to be cautious. Yesterday, because the venue was under construction, the conference feared petty theft and leakage, and sent a letter to the Wenmiao Road Police Station of the Ximen Sub-bureau of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, requesting police patrols. The original letter stated: "To whom it may concern, the purpose of this conference is to promote national goods and relieve disaster victims. After active preparations, we have determined to officially open on the 26th of this month. Because the venue is currently under construction, we fear that there may be petty thieves mixed in with the workers, causing leakage. We request that your station provide a few police officers to patrol back and forth near the construction site for three or four days to prevent this from happening. We are sending this letter for your reference."</p>

<p>Since Director Cai concurrently assumed the post of director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau Police Training Institute, and Qiu Yuesong was appointed as director of education, efforts to reorganize have not been spared, and the affairs of the institute are thriving. Recently, in order to promote the New Life Movement and advocate labor service, a New Life Labor Service Corps was specially organized. Yesterday, the entire corps of more than 300 people, carrying tools such as iron shovels and brooms, were organized and sent to Nanshi, Gaochangmiao, Dapu Road, Longhua Road, and Riweiqiao to sweep garbage, and to go from house to house, persuading residents to implement the New Life. At that time, the weather was warm, and working too hard caused many to have sweat on their faces. The streets were clean and refreshed, and the residents were deeply moved by the sight. Their contribution to the advancement of the New Life Movement and the promotion of labor service in this city is by no means insignificant. It is said that the corps will continue to go to various streets to work and serve every Sunday in the future.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Federation of Machine-Made National Goods Factories previously submitted a petition to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce on April 14th of last year, requesting that the Legislative Yuan propose a supplement to the Trademark Law because the interpretation of the Trademark Law was unusual and detrimental to national credibility. Yesterday, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce replied: "We have received your petition. The Ministry is preparing to review the matter, but it is related to the Executive Yuan's order to draft amendments to the Trademark Law. Therefore, it is being reviewed together. The draft has been prepared by the Ministry and submitted to the Executive Yuan for review. In accordance with your petition, you are hereby notified."</p>
<h3 id="e108">Municipal Chamber of Commerce Writes to the Bureau of Public Works Requesting the Opening of the Tongmatang Dam <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce wrote to the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Public Works yesterday, stating: "To whom it may concern, according to a letter from Zhong Yibo, director of the Jiangwan branch of our chamber, dated the 19th of this month, the Zoumatang River in this town has not been opened, affecting the transportation of goods and causing great suffering to merchants. A letter was previously submitted, and a method of partially opening the dam was offered, but more than half a month has passed and it has not been implemented. It is rumored that the project will be opened only after the bridge reconstruction project is completed and staff have been dispatched for inspection and acceptance. However, it is found that the Wanan Bridge is currently being reconstructed at Xianghua Bridge, and vehicles are not allowed to pass. This has greatly hindered the transportation of goods by both land and water, which has a great impact on the interests of merchants. We have received petitions from various merchants expressing their suffering and urging us to write to your council again, forwarding it to the Municipal Bureau of Public Works, to approve the aforementioned method of partially enclosing the dam at both the east and west ends, so as to facilitate transportation and benefit merchants and the public. According to this, we found that on the 4th of this month, the branch office sent a letter with the same request, and we sent a letter to your bureau with No. 393, requesting that you expedite the matter. Now it is said that the entire river project will take time to complete and accept. Long-term enclosure of the dam is indeed detrimental to the transportation of goods. We are sending this letter for your attention, hoping that your bureau will approve the request in the previous letter and order the dam to be opened at both the east and west ends, while ordering the river dredging project to be completed as soon as possible, in order to facilitate traffic. We look forward to your reply, and we are deeply grateful."</p>

<p>According to the New Voice News Agency, more than 300 fishermen from Wenzhou, including Zhou Zhiming, found it difficult to make a living in their hometown and brought their fishing gear to fish in the Huawushan and Shengshan areas of Chongming County. On the 12th of this month, they took the Fuping steamboat of the Zhenan Company from Ruian and Pingyang to Huawushan and Shengshan. Unexpectedly, when they arrived, they were refused landing by the local fishermen, who even fired shots as a warning. Zhou Zhiming and others, fearing trouble, took the boat back to Shanghai, arriving the day before yesterday. The boat docked at the Nanmatou of Shiliupu. Representatives were sent to the Wenzhou Fellow-Provincials Association to request relief. After receiving the report, the association found that the fishermen had limited funds, could not afford to stay in hotels, and had no place to stay due to the large number of people. Therefore, it ordered them to stay on the boat temporarily and sent letters to the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau and the Water Patrol Team for protection to avoid trouble. At the same time, it also requested the Shanghai Ping Steamboat Joint Bureau to reduce fares for the fishermen and send them back to their hometown.</p>

<h3 id="e113">Second Group Wedding: Machine Industry Association Distributes "The Way of Husband and Wife" <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Machine-Made National Goods Factories Association, in order to promote conjugal love, specially sent a letter to the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau yesterday, requesting that "The Way of Husband and Wife" be distributed when the second group wedding of the new life movement is held on May 1st. The original letter stated: "To whom it may concern, the way of husband and wife is profound and complex. In ancient times, some people disliked their wives being naked in private rooms, while others loved their wives so much that they forgot their status. Because of the difference between love and dislike, some were as intimate as mandarin ducks, while others separated like swallows. Since the eastward spread of Europeanization, freedom has been valued, and the Zhou Dynasty's influence is no longer heard of in today's world. The matter of breaking free from constraints is even more frequently reported in newspapers. Husband and wife are the starting point of human relations. If the way of husband and wife is bitter, the family will be in turmoil. The association has recognized this and has published an article on "The Way of Husband and Wife" in each issue of the Machine Industry Association Journal in the past, so as to guide the young couples of the 20th century onto the right track, so that they can enjoy the harmony of the zither and the flute, and the love in the boudoir is more important than everything else. It has now been published as a separate book entitled "The Way of Husband and Wife." We have learned that your bureau has scheduled to hold the second group wedding ceremony of the new life movement at the Municipal Government Auditorium on May 1st, eliminating cumbersome procedures and reforming bad customs, and forging a marriage alliance, which is indeed a grand event for promoting the new life movement. However, the way of husband and wife cannot be absent to embellish it. Our association intends to send some copies at that time for your bureau to give to the newlyweds, so that they can have a good relationship and grow old together. Perhaps it will also be an aid to the government's promotion of the new life movement. We hereby send this letter and await your reply."</p>

<p>The Girls' Association, initiated and organized by the Shanghai Women's Education Hall on Hualong Road, held its first tea party at Zhaofeng Park at 3:00 PM yesterday.

She reported on the significance of the meeting, stating that similar associations are organized in various countries in Europe and Asia, but the names are different. This association should be a pioneering initiative in China, with the aim of connecting emotions, exchanging knowledge, training for group life, and providing proper entertainment, so that they can be comforted spiritually. She hoped that the sisters would actively participate. Subsequently, Ms. Bu Zhenhua, director of the civic group of the hall, gave a speech, stating that girls are like the sun in the morning and flowers in spring. Although there are many happy futures, there are also many obstacles and dangers. If they want to resolve future troubles, they should start today to work hard to enrich their knowledge and cultivate their virtues, so that they can be self-sufficient in the future and not be laughed at and rejected by society. Even if they do not dedicate themselves to society, they can also be a virtuous wife and good mother in the family. The purpose of the Girls' Association is also the same. Subsequently, the members freely expressed their opinions and discussed "How to Make Our Bodies Healthy" and how to pay attention to hygiene in clothing, food, and housing.

<p>Yin Wang, a woman from Taizhou residing at No. 44, Sanqingfang, Huade Road, had a daughter named Liu Mei, 13 years old. Due to poverty, it was difficult to make a living. On March 18th, at about 3:00 PM, Wang Mama, an old woman from the same village, and Chen Liji, from Yangzhou, introduced her to Wu Ziheng and his wife Qiao, from the same village at No. 72, Lane 142, Xinji Bang Road, as a maid. It was agreed that the annual salary would be four yuan, for a period of two years. The girl was sent to work for several months. The girl's mother went to Chen to get the four yuan, asking him to pass on the message. Chen made excuses to negotiate, but never returned. The next day, Xiang said that Wu Ziheng's family had moved and could not be found. Yin Wang realized that these people had colluded to sell her daughter and turned them over to Hua Police Officer No. 1741 and Detective Ji Xiucheng, who took them to the Yangshupu Police Station. The police chief learned the details and ordered them to be detained. The day before yesterday at noon, Detective Ji learned from a mover named Xi that Wu Ziheng and his wife were hiding at the home of a friend at No. 60 in the same lane. He secretly went to the address and arrested Wang and others. Yesterday, they were sent to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Li Zhishan, a lawyer from the Public Works Department, detailed the previous situation and said that the defendants had said in the police station that Zhao Zhiming, who was at large, had taken the girl to Daqiao and sold her for forty yuan, which was shared and used. The case was requested to be postponed. Then, Wang's mother proved the process. When questioned, the defendants' statements were vague. Judge Wu Zehan ordered them to be detained separately for further verification at a later date.</p>

<p>Mr. Zhang Shanzi, a member of the Huangshan Construction Committee, took hundreds of pieces of Huangshan Club's artistic works of famous scenic spots to various places in Southeast Asia on the 19th of last month for promotion. On the ship, the captain of the Lapudana ship, which he was traveling on, requested that a part of the works be exhibited on the ship, which was highly praised by people from various countries. After arriving in Southeast Asia, the people in Singapore, Penang, and various federations of Malaysia, such as Selangor and Perak, all loved them. Tens of thousands of overseas Chinese visited the exhibition in each place. Westerners especially expressed their admiration. Local politicians led their children to the exhibition and were amazed by Zhang's works. Therefore, they visited Zhang one after another. A female painter named Mrs. Peony even invited him to cooperate on a tiger and leopard painting, opening a new record of Chinese and Western art cooperation. Under admiration, Europeans asked Zhang to take the scenery of Huangshan and his works to Europe and the United States for exhibition. Zhang said that this trip was originally scheduled for Southeast Asia and had not been agreed to by the central government and the Construction Committee, so it was inconvenient to follow the request. Therefore, he returned to China on time and arrived in Shanghai with honor yesterday morning. At noon, Mr. Hu Guigeng, the Shanghai manager of Yong'an Hall, specially held a banquet at Taolechun to welcome Zhang. More than 20 people, including Ye Yuhu, Xu Beihong, Wang Mianzhi (principal of Peiping Art School), Zhu Yazhen, He Guanwu, Pan Lesheng, Chen Wanli, Jiang Teng, and Zhang Daqian, attended. During the banquet, Zhang reported on the exhibition process and his feelings, saying that the impression he got from representing the Huangshan Club at the exhibition in Southeast Asia was very good. Westerners and overseas Chinese did not pay much attention to Chinese culture in the past. After this visit, they realized the greatness of China and the nobility of its culture. Overseas Chinese also had a better understanding of their motherland. They especially admired Yu (Zhang referred to himself) and others for their spirit of not soliciting donations, not selling out, and not selling tickets, which was very effective in promoting our country's inherent culture. The Hu Wenhu and Wenbao brothers of the overseas Chinese community also voluntarily donated 10,000 yuan to establish a civilian hospital in Huangshan. The guests and hosts enjoyed themselves until about 2:00 PM before dispersing. It is reported that Zhang will stay in Shanghai for a few days before returning to Suzhou to visit relatives, and then go to Beijing to report the process to the Construction Committee.</p>

<h3 id="e119">Illegally Setting Up a Morphine Factory; Accomplice Russian Arrested; Russian Vigorously Denies; Order to Retrieve Case Files for Further Interrogation <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>A Russian named Artemski, Si Dani Sila (transliteration), 45 years old this year, invested 4,000 yuan in January 1933 to partner with a Frenchman named Aiju Bo Liye (transliteration) and a German named Bai Shi (transliteration) to open a morphine factory in the Chinese area of ​​West Shanghai, Columbia Road. Bai Shi was hired as a secretly manufacturing engineer. Before long, the competent public security bureau found out and arrested the German Bai Shi and hired Chinese accomplices Zhang Yunbao and Jin A'gen, and confiscated machines and toxic substances. They were transferred to the Shanghai Local Court for trial. Bai Shi was sentenced to one year in prison and fined 3,000 yuan. The Chinese Zhang Yunbao and others were also sentenced separately. The Frenchman Aiju Bo Liye was also arrested and transferred to the French Consulate for interrogation. He was sentenced to one year in prison and fined 3,000 francs on February 7 of that year. Aiju refused to accept the original verdict and appealed to the High Court of Saigon, Annam. At that time, the Russian Artemski was the only one who escaped and lived freely until now. Two years later, at the beginning of this year, the German Bai Shi was released after serving his sentence and paying a fine by the Shanghai Local Court. Because the Russian Artemski was also a shareholder, he did not provide assistance or rescue at the time. It was hateful to be free. Because he lived at No. 35, No. 66 Laerdong Road in the French Concession, he reported it to the French police, requesting an arrest and interrogation. The chief of police approved and sent detectives to arrest Artemski on March 6 this year and found the correspondence between Aiju Bo Liye and Bai Shi and evidence that he sold toxic substances. He was taken back to the police station for detention and transferred to the First Special District Local Court. The police lawyer filed a public prosecution based on the Anti-Smoking Law and the Criminal Law. Judge Zhang Chaozuo opened several court sessions for interrogation. The defendant denied colluding to open a morphine factory. He was ordered to be remanded in custody for a later date to retrieve and review the case file of Aiju Bo Liye from the French Consulate before conducting another interrogation. The judge opened another court session the day before yesterday for further interrogation. Lawyer Gu Shouxi from the police department appeared in court. Bai Shi, the witness who was summoned, did not arrive. When asked, the defendant still denied it. The court verified the confession and, since the summoned witness had not arrived and the French Consulate case file was still in the Saigon Court and had not been retrieved, it was ruled that the defendant should be remanded to the police station for another interrogation at a later date.</p>

<p>Child abduction is a daily occurrence in Shanghai. Recently, a type of kidnapper specifically targets students residing at schools, falsely claiming to be family members sent to pick them up. To counter this, many are targeting schools, employing various tactics. On the afternoon of the 20th of this month, at a certain school on Ju Po Lai Si Road in West Shanghai, a student was residing. At approximately 4 PM, a kidnapper went to the school, falsely claiming to be the student's maternal uncle, sent by the father to pick him up. The teacher at the school found it suspicious, as it was a Friday and there was no letter. Questioning the student, the student stated that his maternal uncle had already died. Further questioning revealed the kidnapper's deception, and he left stammering. Schools and families should pay close attention to this.</p>

<p>Around 9:30 PM the night before, the Yongtai Opium Paper Store at No. 147 Dalin Road, Nanshi, was closing for the night when four armed robbers in short clothes suddenly broke in. Under the guise of purchasing goods, they went straight to the counter, pulled out guns, and warned everyone to be quiet. One robber monitored their movements while the other three searched and looted the store. As a result, thirty-five dollars in banknotes, twenty-odd cents in small coins, and twenty strings of copper coins were stolen from the cash register drawer. After the robbery, the four thieves fled with their loot. Afterward, the store owner reported the incident to the Ximen Branch of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, requesting an investigation and apprehension of the criminals.

<h3 id="e131">Children's Broadcasting Competition: Awards Presented to Group A Yesterday <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>The awards ceremony for Group A of the Children's Broadcasting Competition was held yesterday at 2 PM at the Dalu Department Store. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Chairman's Speech</p>
<p>The Children's Broadcasting Competition, co-organized by the Shanghai Wireless Radio Station of the Ministry of Communications and the China National Products Company, held its awards ceremony for Group A yesterday afternoon in the dining area of the Dalu Department Store. Wen Yuqing (represented by Gao Yuanchun), Director of the International Telegraph Administration, Pan Gongzhan (represented by Fang Shousong), Director of the Education Bureau, Li Kangnian, Shen Jinghui, Chen Junwu, and others, as well as over 300 children and their families, were present. Chairman Gao Yuanchun delivered a speech, stating that the Shanghai Wireless Radio Station and the China National Products Company initiated the Children's Broadcasting Competition to promote children's intelligence. He expressed his joy at seeing the children's vitality, innocence, and enthusiastic participation. He emphasized the significant responsibility that children bear, urging them to not only diligently pursue knowledge but also to strengthen their physical fitness to be able to take on the responsibility of saving the nation in the future.</p>
<p>Representative's Speech</p>
<p>Subsequently, Ding Zixiao, a representative of the children, delivered a speech, stating that the call for promoting national products in China has been going on for four years, but the result has been that imports have not decreased but increased. This is heartbreaking. It is all because adults, gentlemen, ladies, and misses are fond of fashion and Western products, wearing suits and leather shoes. They have completely forgotten the sounds of gunfire on September 18th and January 28th, using precious money to provide foreigners with the means to manufacture guns and cannons to slaughter our compatriots. This is a heartbreaking matter. Although this is a manifestation of treacherous merchants loving money and forgetting the nation, it is also the result of compatriots being greedy for cheap goods. Even more strange is that people who wear Western clothes, eat Western food, and ride in cars constantly shout about promoting national products, without thinking about their own clothing, food, housing, and transportation. All of this is a contradictory phenomenon. He hoped that from this year onward, all Chinese people would unite as one, block the outflow of money, promote national products, and boycott foreign goods, so that the country can be revived.</p>
<p>Awards Presentation</p>
<p>Finally, the children performed songs, Cantonese opera, Peking opera, and other performances. Then, the awards ceremony was held. The 24 winners were: 1. Ding Zixiao, 2. Du Jie, 3. Fang Meili, 4. Ma Sihong, 5. Qian Jingyun, 6. Zhou Qichang, 7. Xu Guanglin, 8. Cheng Shufang, 9. Xu Si, 10. Liu Ruonan, 11. Qin Pengzhang, 12. Chen Rong, 13. Chen Tianle, 14. Xu Weishan, 15. Du Daqi, 16. Guo Shujuan, 17. Xi Yukun, 18. Qin Ma, 19. Feng Ying, 20. Sun Juying, 21. Yan Wenshu, 22. Peng Kaihua, 23. Lu Yongfa, 24. Cai Ruitong. Each winner was awarded a silver shield, a silver cup, and national products. All other participants were given a commemorative plaque.</p>
<h3 id="e132">Tragic Boating Accident at Liwa Lita Village: Chen Siblings Tragically Die, Village Authorities Should Improve Conditions Immediately <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>Chen Wenlan, a 32-year-old man from Dinghai, took his cousin Chen Xiufeng (also known as Ding Chenshi), 29 years old, and other relatives, nine people in total, to Liwa Lita Village in West Shanghai for a holiday outing yesterday afternoon at 3 PM. After walking around for a while, Chen and his relatives decided to go boating. They split into two groups and took two small boats to go boating on the river. Chen and his cousin, along with three others, were in one boat, leading the way. The other four people were in another small boat, following behind. Unexpectedly, when Chen's boat reached the middle of the river, it suddenly tilted to the left due to uneven weight distribution. The people in the boat panicked and, in the chaos, the boat capsized, causing everyone to fall into the water. Chen's relatives in the boat behind saw this and bravely rowed over to rescue them. They saw three people clinging to the side of the boat and rescued them first. However, Chen and Xiufeng were nowhere to be seen. After pushing the overturned boat aside, Chen and Xiufeng were finally brought out of the water. The village staff had also heard the news and rushed to the scene, quickly pulling up Chen and Ding Chenshi. However, they had swallowed too much water, and their faces were lifeless, with only a faint breath remaining. They were rushed to Hong'en Hospital for treatment, but despite the hospital administering oxygen and other treatments, it was ineffective, and they soon died. The bodies were taken by their relatives to the Huanqiu Funeral Home on Jing'an Temple Road, and the coffin was scheduled for placement on the afternoon of the 23rd, a truly tragic event. However, after investigation, this is not the first accident involving boating in this village. The reason for the accidents may be that the construction of the small boats is not adequate. It is hoped that the village staff will quickly improve the situation to avoid future tragedies.</p>

<p>— (Jin Xiong Yu)</p>
<p>Elsewhere, "people" are "people," but in Shanghai, "people" have become "money." Look: in the morning, rickshaw pullers with smiling faces take "people" as "fare" and pull them away. In bookstores, stores with big discounts play music, treating "people" as "the price of goods," welcoming customers. At night, landlords are so eager, treating "people" as "rent," opening the door to let them in.</p>
<p>Farmers in the fields, "heave-ho, heave-ho..." together carry the crops back home. When I see that, I only feel admiration. Western-style couples in department stores, "murmuring and mumbling," walk arm in arm up and down. When I see that, I only feel disgusted.</p>
<p>Ah! I thought I was sleeping in my beloved's arms, my chest pressed tightly against hers, but when I opened my eyes, I was still lonely, embracing the quilt alone. In that instant, I felt the pain of lost love.</p>
<h3 id="e152">Spring Scenery of West Lake in the Late Song Dynasty <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>— 19</p>
<p>In the spring, countless people depend on West Lake for their livelihood; therefore, Hangzhou people have the saying "three winters rely on one spring." West Lake is at its best in spring, not only now, but it has always been so. Qu Zongji of the Ming Dynasty wrote "West Lake's Four Seasons, Looking South," which describes the spring scenery of West Lake at that time: "West Lake scenery, spring days are best when sunny. Beneath the flowers, music and songs at the young masters' banquets, along the water's edge, beautiful people walk, ten miles of singing." How prosperous it already was! However, the spring scenery of West Lake in the late Song Dynasty was even more prosperous than in the Ming Dynasty. Here, I extract a section from the "West Lake Fu" by Bai Tingyu of the Yuan Dynasty to give a glimpse:</p>
<p>"Especially the dragon boats in pairs, drums pounding, display hundreds of performances on the water, erecting six markers in the heart of the lake... The viewers' boats are in two rows, like broad paths; the welcomers' silk banners are like long forests. Every five steps, there is a pavilion, serving wine, tea, and pastries. The sounds of music and singing boil, carriages bustle. Willow branches touch the ground, flower formations line the clouds. Shuttle doors and swings appear and disappear in the emerald greenery; dancing costumes and singing fans twirl in the fragrant dust... Eyes cannot take it all in, steps cannot follow. Imagining the Song Sister Geng of Huai and Lu, still presenting crane dances performed by actors. Cutting silk and arranging flowers on plates, molding sugar into scales to thread on willow branches. Decorating wooden soldiers on small crossbars, stringing furniture on long bamboo. Oars and arrows stir up thunder in the air, kites compete with the warp and weft of the nine heavens. Catapults, ivory crossbows, painting sticks and splashing basins. (Note: "Treading on mixed talent" and "splashing minister basin" are both water games.) Silk socks step on the waves, golden hairpins illuminate the spring. Often there are sons who gather red and pick green, and how can there be no guests who seek secluded beauty? This is just a mention of a fraction of the ninety days of spring."</p>
<p>It is said that Tingyu was born during the Lizong era. What he describes above is a depiction of the spring scenery of West Lake in the late Song Dynasty, the liveliness of which is no less than that of Yu Xin's "Spring Fu." However, at that time, the country was already in a precarious state, yet the people still embellished peace and lived in a drunken dream. How can we not sigh deeply after reading this!</p>
<h3 id="e153">Young Master Kite <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>— Yan</p>
<p>From the kite-flying competition in the capital's Yuhuatai, where 150,000 people watched, I thought of the Young Master Kite of Changshu twenty years ago. All kites are named after what they resemble in shape, such as eagle kites, butterfly kites, centipede kites, etc. Only this Young Master Kite is named after the person who flies it. Therefore, the Young Master Kite is the kite played by young masters and sons.</p>
<p>The Young Master Kite does not compete in size, but rather emphasizes its smallness and exquisiteness. It is made of finely woven and smooth bamboo strips for the kite's frame, covered with cicada-wing gauze that can be stretched or shrunk. When stretched, it is colorful and beautiful, and when shrunk, it folds like a fan and is placed in a bag. The bag is also exquisitely made, using brocade and silk, embroidered with flowers, birds, insects, and fish, and adorned with tassels, mostly made by young women of noble families. The kite is placed in the brocade bag, and the bag is hung at the waist, just like the elegant scholars of old hanging their fans from their waistbands. The kite's string is also made of white silk instead of coarse hemp. The colorful kite, paired with the pure white string, enhances its beauty.</p>
<p>In the bright spring, with gentle spring breezes, young masters and sons would agree to go to the suburbs to fly kites as a game. Behind each young master, there would always be a servant to assist in unraveling the silk thread and releasing the kite. They would either guide it themselves or hand it over to the servant, while they admired it from the side. The colorful kites stood steadily in the wind in the sky, light and carefree. The colorful young masters walked slowly back and forth on the ground, speaking softly and laughing gently. The spring scenery was enchanting, the kites were enchanting, and the young masters were enchanting. This enchanting scene was so delightful! When they were tired, they would order the servant to help wind the thread and retrieve the kite, then place it back in the brocade bag, tie it to their waists, and slowly return home along the setting sun and evening breeze.</p>
<p>In recent years, things have been depressed everywhere, and the bourgeoisie has also declined. The qualifications of young masters and sons no longer exist, so these elegant pastimes of twenty years ago are no longer seen today. This simple pleasure of flying kites also evokes a sense of滄桑 in this era. It is regrettable!</p>

<p>Chapter 12: Ashamed of Being Naked, She Avoids Guests Behind a Curtain; Diligently Saving Kerosene, He Copies Books at Dawn</p>
<p>When Bei Hai heard that Yue Ying was here, he himself felt a little hot in the face. He thought to himself, what is the reason for this? Mr. Cheng let her sleep in his bed, but he hid away. If a respectable male friend came, wouldn't there be a misunderstanding? Regardless of any suspicion, I have to sit in this room and study. If someone comes, I can also explain things for Mr. Cheng. Thinking this, he walked back into the room, ignoring the person on the bed, and sat down at the table near the window as if he owned the place, spreading out the books he had brought. Yue Ying inside the mosquito net could see clearly. She knew that Wang Bei Hai was a very proper person and would not do anything untoward, but still, being stark naked and sleeping in someone else's bed was a very embarrassing thing. Her heart was uneasy, and she just kept tossing and turning in bed. Bei Hai couldn't bear it any longer, so he spoke to her inside the net: "Is that Miss Zhu inside? Are you feeling unwell?" Yue Ying was too embarrassed to answer and continued to lie there silently. Bei Hai saw a thermos on the table and picked it up. The bottle was very heavy, so it must be filled with water. So, he said, "Miss Zhu, there is hot water here. Shall I pour you a cup to drink?" Yue Ying saw that the man was being so attentive that she felt too embarrassed to continue ignoring him, so she replied, "I dare not trouble you." Bei Hai then moved a square stool and placed it in front of the bed. He poured a large cup of hot water, added some tea concentrate from the teapot, and carefully placed it on the stool. Then, he smiled at the net and said, "Take it and drink it yourself." (187)</p>

<p>— Originally written by Princess Der Ling of the Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>They also have a characteristic, which is that they are rich in the spirit of "artisan work," meaning working only for the sake of "art" and "work." Each pair of phoenix shoes takes at least a month to make, and within that month, the amount of effort they put into each pair of phoenix shoes is immeasurable. However, the result of their efforts can only be seen by the Empress Dowager herself, and even if the Empress Dowager likes them and uses them, only a few of us have the opportunity to admire them. Who else can discover their ingenious craftsmanship? Therefore, when they are making them, they never intend to boast to the public, but only want to make this craft as perfect as their ideals! Moreover, most of the embroidered shoes they make are relegated to the cold palace by the Empress Dowager, and are always guarded by two old eunuchs who are full and have nothing to do. They have no chance to see the world, and they are equal to working hard for nothing. But they are not discouraged and still work with all their effort. How can this kind of spirit be possessed by ordinary artists and master craftsmen?</p>
<p>Since these young girls live such extraordinary lives in such a special environment, their thoughts inevitably become very unique. It seems that they are very indifferent to getting married and raising children. I have also indirectly heard their comments, and they are generally satisfied with the status quo. They regard those squares of tribute satin as their husbands, and those skeins of silk thread as their children. In their hearts, they truly love these two companions who are always with them.

<p>In Shanghai, which is praised as the "Paris of the East," whether on the roads of the British Concession or the French Concession, one often sees "foreigners," especially "foreign women," walking around. Eight or nine out of ten are leading a dog, or two, or even three. Big and small, of all kinds, wagging their tails, following their owners, or leading their owners.</p>
<p>Sometimes, a "motorcar" whirs past. Inside, in addition to the "foreigner" sitting there, there is often a dog squatting on it. Head held high, tongue lolling, proudly looking at everything! As a result, its owner seems even more impressive.</p>
<p>I don't know why, but these things invariably make me think of the parks in the concessions. Before they were opened, "Chinese and dogs" were "not allowed to enter." At the time, we Chinese felt that this was an insult! However, now seeing "foreigners" and dogs so "inseparable," it suddenly dawns on me! I feel that the word "dog" in the phrase "Chinese and dogs not allowed to enter" really referred to the dogs kept by the Chinese! As for "foreign dogs," of course, they were not included. Otherwise, if "foreign dogs" were also restricted from entering and leaving the park, would their owners be willing?</p>
<p>Alas! In this light, that notice saying "Chinese and dogs not allowed to enter" was tantamount to announcing to the Chinese people: "Only foreigners and foreign dogs are allowed to enter!" Thinking about it carefully, we are all the same, so what is insulting about it? Hehe!</p>

<p>— (Hong Jingshan)</p>
<p>Returned from the sea to lie ill in Baisha Village in the winter month of Jiaxu, taking stock of the factory gates. Adding Sighs, both are written with a stone broom.</p>
<p>Shadowed by the small building's gloom, the cold ripples reflect my image, graying hair too heavy for the hairpin. Returning, ah, returning, the year draws to a close, myriad feelings given over to oblivion. Beyond the frozen mist, the pruned branches rustle in the evening, just as weary birds fly three or two to return to their nests. Likewise drifting, several times ceasing the construction, such a descent. Looking back on the Jiangguan journey, tears still stain my collar, no heart to pluck the sword. The streams and mountains of my hometown, childhood fishing and frolicking, like a dream, afraid to seek them out again. Completely inviting mountain apes and cranes, yet in the vast expanse, who will send money to buy a mountain? Waiting to dispel sorrow with clear wine, but sorrow is too deep!</p>

<h3 id="e158">Random Tidbits from the Yokohama Exposition (Part 1) <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>— Ji Yun</p>
<p>Yokohama suffered the most severe damage during the Great Kanto Earthquake in Japan, with almost the entire city being reduced to rubble. After more than ten years of arduous effort, its surface facilities have already surpassed pre-disaster levels. The exposition commemorates this recovery movement, and thus it serves as a display of local products from various regions. The Yokohama Municipal Government initiated the event, with various prefectures joining in. Territories such as Korea, Taiwan, and areas under South Seas governance also have exhibits. Additionally, there are Manchurian and Siamese pavilions. These areas neither suffered from the earthquake nor underwent reconstruction, making their inclusion quite inappropriate and incongruous.</p>
<p>The Opening of the Port Memorial Hall showcases Yokohama's female-oriented progress, with the construction of telephone systems, automobiles, and running water all represented through illustrations and models. At the entrance stand two Japanese individuals dressed in the attire of police officers from the port's opening era. They wear conical straw hats and short brown jackets, with a white "Sun" character emblazoned on the back of their necks, the meaning of which remains unclear. A Japanese sword is tucked at their waists. To the side, there are also old-fashioned sword and spear racks, holding various long-handled weapons.</p>
<p>The Reconstruction Hall features numerous photographs depicting the harrowing scenes of the disaster, evoking the extreme fear experienced during the earthquake. A map, spanning over ten feet, is compiled from aerial photography, ensuring its detail and accuracy. Tall Western-style buildings appear as mere grains, with magnifying glasses provided to aid viewers with less acute vision.</p>
<p>Although there is a large character at the top of this exposition, it is actually quite small. Besides the entirety of Yokohama's Yamashita Park, there is another area across the road, which is even smaller. The middle section is further divided into two parts by a road, so they built wooden bridges to accommodate the crowds, a rather crude method. Due to the difficulty of transporting large-scale machinery, few such items are on display. The exhibits in the various pavilions mainly consist of light industrial metal products, lacquerware, carpentry, textiles, and daily necessities.</p>
<p>Japanese women also use very small folding fans, with a ladder-style construction similar to those in our country. They have large white ribs and small wooden ribs, with the fan surface being only three or four inches wide, narrower than the ribs on the back. Both the fan surface and ribs are printed with various patterns of flowers and plants, with elegant and subtle colors, which is quite novel. The greatest characteristic of Japanese manufactured goods is their ability to utilize waste materials. Bamboo scraps and large wood shavings are all used as materials. A beautiful seashell, with a small figure attached, becomes an ornament. This is similar to the people in Jiangbei, China, who place powdered figures in clam shells. Nara has sacred deer that live in groups in the forests, and the Japanese do not dare to harm them. The local people use the shed antlers to make cigarette holders and ornaments.</p>
<p>Japanese matches are mostly in flat boxes, with each box only holding about thirty matches, sold for one foreign cent. Large stores often paste advertisements on them and give them to customers, with each person receiving four or five boxes. Therefore, in Japan, if you smoke, you almost don't need to buy matches. The advertisements on the boxes are gold, silver, and colored, small and exquisitely designed. Printing costs in Japan are very cheap.</p>

<p>The Jiangnan and Huaguang track and field teams held a match yesterday afternoon at 2:00 pm at the Chizhi College on Shuidian Road. Jiangnan boasts national athletes such as Hao Chunde, Tao Yingjie, Cao Yu, Gong Wanyu, Zhang Jiakui, and Wang Jihuai, while Huaguang has Tu Zhengling, Jia Lianren, Pan Chengbin, Li Yuanyuan, Guan Youwen, etc. The two sides are evenly matched and equally strong, making the competition extremely fierce and rare. Also, since this match is to examine each athlete's performance, only the rankings are recorded, not the scores, so the winner is not recorded. Yesterday's race was most notable for Wang Zhengling's 5,000-meter time of 17 minutes 10.8 seconds, breaking the national record. Jia Lianren's 800-meter and Guan Youwen's 1,500-meter times were also rare this season. Tao Yingjie, the famous hurdler, seemed to be neglecting his training, and Dong Shuzhao was absent due to business, so there were no good records in the 400-meter. The triple jump was called off due to lack of time. The results are as follows:</p>

<p>In this year's Western League soccer tournament, except for the final match between Xingguang and St. Francis in Group E, the other matches such as the Scott Cup, Group A Cup, Zilin Cup, Junior Cup, and Group B, C, and D Cups, have all concluded successively. Yesterday afternoon, Donghua met Ennis at Shenyuan, in the last match of Group A. Both sides were evenly matched, and the situation was extremely balanced. Donghua finally relied on the bravery of its entire team to win 2-1. It is not easy for a Group B team to play so vibrantly.</p>
<p>First Half</p>
<p>The match began with alternating attacks and defenses, and the teams were evenly matched. After about ten minutes, Donghua's Zhou Guangzhong got the ball and advanced. The enemy defense resulted in a corner kick. Yang Renwei kicked it well, and Qian Zuozhi hooked it into the net from the crowd. After the goal, the British army counterattacked strongly. Once, Chen Gongyu illegally hit someone in the penalty area and was penalized with a penalty kick. The enemy center forward kicked it, and it went to the left. Then, they kicked a free kick outside the twelve-yard line, and it went to the right. One left and one right, complementing each other interestingly. In the first half, Donghua took the lead with one goal.</p>
<p>Second Half</p>
<p>Changing sides, Ennis tried to cheer up and came fiercely, but because Donghua's defense was strict, there was no chance to take advantage of. Ten minutes before the end of the game, Ennis launched a surprise attack. The right winger got a chance to take a corner kick. Guan Dangan slapped it not far, and Tai Hede sent it into the net corner, making it 1-1. The situation suddenly became tense. Feng Nianhan entered the abdomen alone, and after aiming, he swept it away. Goalkeeper Smithon jumped up to catch it, and Qian Zuozhi slammed on it. Smithon slipped the ball he had in his grasp. Before the central kick-off, the battle ended. Donghua won 2-1.</p>

<h3 id="e166">Surrounded by Green Mountains and Wildflowers Like Hairpins, the Third Shandong Provincial National Arts Examination Opens, Male and Female Heroes Offer Themselves <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: The third Shandong Provincial National Arts Examination, after several months of preparation, opened this morning (20th) at the Provincial People's Sports Field at the foot of Thousand Buddha Mountain. The morning sun was slightly bright, the mountains were verdant, and the wildflowers were like brocade. The officials of the conference and the male and female examinees arrived at the venue very early. People from all walks of life took time out to watch, which was extremely lively. The heads of various agencies and guests included Governor of Shandong Province Han Fuju, Qingdao Mayor Shen Honglie, Jiaoji Railway Committee Chairman Ge Guangting, Director of the Education Department He Siyuan, Provincial Committee Member Lin Jiqing, Provincial Executive Committee Member Li Wenqi, and dozens of consultants and senators from the Provincial Government. At 7:00 am, a meeting was held in front of the main building. The military band was in the south, the first row in front of the stage was for the conference officials, and behind them were all 610 examinees, with orderly discipline. After the meeting started according to the ritual, the Chairman of the Examination Committee, Han Fuqu, gave the opening speech, followed by honorary Examination Committee Chairman Shen Honglie, Guidance Committee Chairman Ge Guangting, Yang Songshan, the supervising committee member sent by the Central National Arts Hall, and judge Liu Buxian, who delivered training speeches successively. Afterwards, Ma Liang and Zhang Ming delivered speeches on behalf of the guests. The photography ceremony was completed at 8:30 am. The performance began at 9:00 am. The ones who took the stage in order were the vine shield and broadsword team of the Nanguan National Arts Society of this city, the entire team of Qingdao athletes, and the performance troupe of children from the National Arts Hall. Among them, the female athletes Yue Xiuyun and Jiang Ailan from the Qingdao team attracted the most attention. The performance ended at 11:00 am, and there was a break. The competition started at 1:00 pm. At that time, there were about 10,000 spectators, and the number of people was unprecedented.</p>
<p>Performing Vine Shield Tactics: The first Shandong Provincial Examination only involved unarmed combat, wrestling, long weapons, and short weapons. The second examination added archery and slingshot performances. This examination also added vine shield tactics, and the atmosphere of reviving the past is becoming increasingly strong. According to legend, the vine shield was a weapon used in the era of knife and spear warfare in ancient China. It has been abandoned and has not been seen in the world for more than 40 years, becoming a historical relic. The National Arts Society on Desheng South Street in this city has recently been practicing this kind of tactics. Today, the president Jiang Laibin led the vine shield team to perform on the field. There are about 40 team members, with green turbans wrapped around their heads, the ends of the turbans hanging behind their heads, and wearing green uniforms. The left hand holds a round shield woven from thin bamboo, covered with a yellow cloth, painted with a tiger head shape, and the right hand holds a single sword. At first glance, it looks like a martial arts performance on the stage. Under the command of vine shield teachers Yang Derun and Yang Jingyi, National Arts teacher Li Kuixiang, and archery teacher Zhang Kehan, the team first performed group exercises, moving forward and backward in accordance with the law, and also performed somersaults with shields, shouting and shaking the earth. Afterwards, they performed duels, broadswords against shields, spears against vine shields, etc. Finally, they stacked vine shields into a mountain, with people behind it, and then performed double duels, climbing the mountain and flipping somersaults down. The surrounding spectators cheered, and gray-haired old men nodded in praise, sighing that they had not seen it for decades. According to the president, this kind of skill can be divided into broadsword shield, double sword shield, Ma Yi shield, Shaozi shield, spear shield, meteor shield, and various formations. Now, because they have not practiced for a long time, they feel quite unfamiliar.</p>

The misunderstanding lies not in the name 'Cunwen' (Preserve Literature), but in specific issues. (1) The problem of vernacular writing: some people think that the Cunwen Association opposes vernacular writing. In fact, I promoted vernacular writing more than thirty years ago. It makes no sense to oppose vernacular writing. However, I believe that articles have different styles, and writing should be free. Each should do what they are suited to do without restrictions. The function of vernacular writing is primarily for enlightenment and secondarily for making things accessible. But apart from these two points, we still advocate using classical Chinese in textbooks above the middle school level. (2) The problem of phonetic script: the Cunwen Association also promotes phonetic script and phonetic symbols. However, if someone were to exclusively use symbols and abandon Chinese characters, the Cunwen Association would absolutely oppose it. (3) The problem of shorthand characters or simplified characters: the Cunwen Association also approves of shorthand characters to a considerable extent and does not oppose them. This is our attitude. For the progress of future work, we hope that at least Chinese teachers above the middle school level will engage in this Cunwen movement. We also hope that students above the general middle school level will have a basic knowledge of classical Chinese, and even if they cannot write articles in classical Chinese, they should at least understand and be able to read classical Chinese." The representatives of the Municipal Party Department and the Municipal Education Bureau also delivered speeches, as did Yao Minghui and others.</p>
<p>Discussion of Proposals</p>
<p>Next, the proposals were discussed: (1) The draft charter of the Cunwen Association was read and amended item by item by the chairman and passed. (2) The draft declaration of the Cunwen Association was resolved to be revised and published by Champion. (3) A proposal to petition the Ministry of Education in the name of the conference to issue an order to all primary schools nationwide to add two hours per week of simple classical Chinese reading from the middle grades onwards was resolved and passed.</p>
<p>Election of Officers</p>
<p>Finally, officers were elected. Under the supervision of Mao Yun, representing the Municipal Party Department, and Nie Haifan, representing the Municipal Education Bureau, Jiang Kanghu, Wang Xishen, Pan Gongzhan, Yao Minghui, Hu Puan, Ma Gongyu, and Qian Jibo were elected as directors. Mao Xiaocen, Jiang Jianbai, and Zhang Feng were elected as alternate directors. The meeting was adjourned for a photograph at noon.</p>
<p>Conference Declaration</p>
<p>The declaration of the Cunwen Association stated: "Since the Cunwen movement was launched, voices of support and opposition have arisen everywhere. Let us leave aside the supporters for now and focus on the arguments of the opponents. A says, 'Literature has not been abandoned; why preserve it? This is baseless moaning and shooting at random.' This person has not considered Yan's four preservations. Human nature, learning, and governance have never been completely absent from this land, yet Yan alone held the warning of 'its loss, its loss.' Is it not because taking care will preserve it, and identifying it early is essential? B says, 'Classical Chinese is dead, like a corpse. It should be buried without decoration.' This contradicts A's statement. Believing this, it is our responsibility to revive the flesh and bones. Once the sword is drawn, there is no turning back, because preserving literature preserves everything, and abandoning literature abandons everything. Literature may not encompass all of culture, but culture cannot be separated from literature.' C says, 'No, what should be abandoned now is only classical Chinese. The rise of vernacular language marks the advancement of culture.' But advancement must be based on what is already there and added to it. How can we rely on decades of creation to erase millennia of heritage? D says, 'No, classical Chinese should only be listed as a special subject for archaeologists to study and artists to appreciate. Why should the public and students study it?' If so, history and culture will be forever separated from the nation, and the nation's vitality will almost be extinguished.' E says, 'Studying it is fine, but only to understand it, not to be arrogant. Reciting classical Chinese or learning vernacular should not be required. However, if you only read but don't write, the meaning will not be precise, and the application will not be broad, and it will become like Latin in European and American schools, transforming from a living language into a dead one. But Latin can die, while classical Chinese cannot. If classical Chinese dies, then language will differ by region, and writing will also differ by region, making it impossible to unify the national language and leading to the division of the national script. Language changes with the times, and writing also changes with the times. Every four or five hundred years, it must be translated once. What are the gains and losses of this?' F says, 'What's the harm? Vernacular writing and phonetic transcription are innovative literature. The elimination of classical Chinese writing and characters is appropriate. Why not learn from Japan's past? Chinese characters were originally imported, and kana has long been in common use. Phonetic transcription is most convenient, so why mix the two? Yet classical Chinese writing and characters have ultimately not been abandoned. What is the reason? It is worth pondering, especially since it is our own heritage.' G says, 'Not abandoning Chinese characters and classical Chinese is fine, but textbooks are readily available in bookstores. Why read the classics, histories, philosophers, and collections? Why make them the standard for literature? Alas, errors are passed down, and bad habits become the norm. Abandoning the original and demolishing the center, what is left? Moreover, literary standards should be based on current practice, as all countries do. Now, we abandon the Zhou tripod and fill it with Kang earthenware, discarding the essence and feeding on dross. What could be worse?' H says, 'The classics, histories, philosophers, and collections are also dross. Quoting erroneous and absurd words from the Four Divisions to attack each other leads to the belief that everything can be demolished. Finding fault with everything and stopping eating because of one choking is like letting yourself freeze and starve. Who can you blame?' I says, 'The evolution of writing is roughly the same as language. The Zhou, Qin, Han, and Tang dynasties did not follow each other. Engaging in stagnation and staying in the past is useless.' This idea seems right, but the change in writing should be very slow, and we should let it evolve naturally. If we change everything into vernacular, it will create a clear divide, which is inconvenient. J says, 'There are many excellent works by vernacular writers. Leaving aside contemporary ones, works like Romance of the Three Kingdoms, Water Margin, Scholars, and Dream of the Red Chamber are in no way inferior to classical Chinese.' This argument is also valid, but up to now, all vernacular writers have been skilled in classical Chinese. A lion fighting a ghost is doubly energetic. If they did not know classical Chinese, would they have achieved these results?' Summarizing the above ten arguments, the answers have been detailed. Other derogatory remarks are intentionally left unsaid, out of respect for individuals and to avoid counterattacks. In short, we acknowledge the value of vernacular language but should not abandon classical Chinese because of it. Phonetic transcription has its functions but should not replace Chinese characters. Vernacular writing can be written but should not prohibit people from promoting classical Chinese. There are many good articles in vernacular, but it should not be regarded as orthodox literature. As the association is now being established, we have presented these scattered opinions, both positive and negative, in a comprehensive declaration."</p>
<h3 id="e177">Li Jinxi Makes Another Statement: The Advantages and Disadvantages of Phonetically Annotated Chinese Characters; Responding to Chen Heqin's Doubts <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>(Beiping Express) Recently, Chen Heqin, Director of the Chinese Education Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council, "Again Discussed the Advantages and Disadvantages of Phonetic Chinese Characters." He responded to the remarks of Li Jinxi, a standing member of the National Language Unification Association. Now, Li has made another statement as follows:</p>
<p>Auxiliary Tools</p>
<p>(1) Mr. Chen says that the phonetic symbols and punctuation marks differ in complexity. But there are sixteen types of completely new punctuation marks, which are not as simple as a dot, a dash, or a line. Only thirty-seven phonetic symbols are used in the national language, which is not comparable to the numerous and complex strokes of Chinese characters. Punctuation marks should be integrated with the meaning of Chinese characters, and phonetic symbols should be integrated with the pronunciation of Chinese characters. Their uses are equivalent, and their shapes must not be confused with Chinese characters. Readers can save time and increase understanding with these two auxiliary tools, without a doubt.</p>
<p>Facts Do Not Match</p>
<p>(2) Mr. Chen's investigation of the situation in Japanese newspapers seems to be inconsistent with the facts. Ordinary Japanese newspapers and popular magazines, except for the number of Chinese characters like one, two, three, etc., which are not annotated, all Chinese characters are annotated. Mr. Chen's so-called "only one or two out of ten" probably refers to high-level literary works, where only rare Chinese characters are occasionally annotated with kana. (According to my own observation, recent Japanese literary works, even more popular ones, are fully annotated with kana.) As for printed materials in six-point type, children should not read them in the first place. If children's books also use six-point type, even without annotation, I know that Mr. Chen cannot guarantee that they will not become nearsighted.</p>
<p>Avoid Harm</p>
<p>(3) In the teaching process, the training of readers should focus attention on Chinese characters, not the annotations. Where does the "disturbance" come from with unknown characters? If there are no annotations, it is a fact that Chinese characters are misrecognized and misheard. How can annotation lead to errors? If there are annotations, unknown characters can be understood by looking at the side, which can at least save the trouble of looking up dictionaries and asking around. How can annotation lead to time consumption? The various harms mentioned by Mr. Chen arise from the lack of annotation next to Chinese characters. Only by promoting phonetically annotated Chinese characters can these harms be avoided.</p>
<p>Overshadowing the Main Thing</p>
<p>(4) All problems should be studied experimentally, but the tools and conditions for research must be complete. Several years ago, a friend feared that phonetic annotation of Chinese characters would overshadow the main thing in the future, and children would only recognize the annotations and neglect the Chinese characters. Therefore, he conducted experiments in a civilian primary school in Dongcheng here. After a year, the students in this class recognized more Chinese characters. He was satisfied and supported phonetic symbols. But I think this kind of experiment is unreliable because the materials used were only a mimeographed phonetic textbook and a daily phonetic newspaper. Whether phonetic symbols will overshadow the main thing in the future is not considered by me, but it is premature for a friend to decide based on this. Therefore, it is necessary to prepare phonetically annotated Chinese character molds and print a large number of reading materials before conducting various studies. Otherwise, it will be detrimental to the authenticity of academic experts' research.</p>
<p>Main Purpose</p>
<p>(5) Mr. Chen has now seen the effectiveness of national language education for overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia. It should be known that national language teachers in overseas Chinese schools have been using phonetic symbols as a tool for teaching the national language in recent years. This is a fact that everyone has seen and heard. What is lacking now is this kind of textbook with phonetic symbols and characters side by side, as well as general phonetic reading materials. According to the report of the National Language Association's special commissioner in Southeast Asia, if there are such publications, the effectiveness of national language education and literacy will be greatly expanded. Special commissioners in Mongolia and Xinjiang have particularly fervent proposals for this. The motivation for the government to allocate funds to cast copper molds for phonetically annotated Chinese characters this time is half for education in the border areas and overseas Chinese education. Mr. Chen's so-called "unifying the national language and unifying the national pronunciation" is indeed one of its goals, but the main purpose is to assist literacy and increase the efficiency of national education. This point should not be ignored. The National Language Association once proposed that the time for public education is currently very limited, while the inculcation of national consciousness and various common senses is also urgent. This kind of tool to assist literacy should be studied by following the example of Japan to maintain a permanent connection. Once the symbols are mastered, the meaning will be clear, and hearing will lead to understanding, making things twice as easy with half the effort. Why should we be concerned about "redundancy"?</p>
<h3 id="e178">Reading Movement Day 13: Wang Xinming Lectures on Literary Research <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday was the thirteenth day of the National Reading Movement Conference, sponsored by the Chinese Culture Construction Association. The association specially invited Wang Xinming to lecture on "How to Study Literature." The full text of the lecture is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Today, at the Reading Movement Conference sponsored by the Chinese Culture Association, I am asked to talk about the problem of "how to study literature." I will now offer my personal opinions for your reference.</p>
<p>In general, literature differs from natural sciences and social sciences. Natural science is the study of explaining phenomena in the natural world. Social science is the tool for explaining various social systems and criticizing various social problems. Literature, however, is the tool for describing nature and society. Natural science and social science emphasize reason and reality, while literature emphasizes emotion and ideals. In fact, this is only a rough distinction. If we examine it more closely, we will know that literature, which describes nature and society, also carries the task of explaining natural phenomena, explaining various social systems, and criticizing various social problems. However, there is an insurmountable watershed between natural science, social science, and literature in the pure theoretical research and the complete expression of emotion.</p>
<p>We believe that there is a common point between literature and natural science and social science. This common point is that all take enriching human life as a prerequisite.</p>
<p>Generally, people regard literature as knowledge without practical application, thinking that literature is a kind of impractical luxury. It is not too much to have it, and not too little to not have it. In fact, literature is a very valuable thing. It not only has the great power of subtly influencing society and deeply affecting people's hearts, but it can also trigger earth-shattering trends. For example, Plato's Republic, Rousseau's theory of natural human rights, the American Declaration of Independence, the French Marseillaise, and Marx's Communist Manifesto were all just novels, articles, or songs at the time, but later they all became the driving force behind political and social revolutions. This is enough to illustrate the greatness of literary influence.</p>
<p>As for the method of studying literature, it varies with the purpose of studying literature. What I hope everyone will study now is the relationship between literature and its background. We should know that the literature of each country and each era must be attached to its special color, either a color that encourages conquering other countries and tribes, or a color that inspires resistance to other countries and tribes, thus forming a "national literature." Regarding this point, we can get considerable proof in literary history.</p>
<p>For example, in China during the Ming and Qing dynasties, wasn't the literature most popular in the lower classes novels and dramas with the theme of conquering other countries and tribes? There are too many names for these novels and dramas to list them all. In a word, they are always "Conquering the West," "Conquering the East," "Pacifying the South," and "Sweeping the North." They all say that a small country around China suddenly changed its always-submissive attitude, mobilized troops to invade China. At first, China was unprepared, and the troops seemed to have entered an uninhabited land everywhere. Later, the emperor became furious and ordered generals to go on expeditions. A large army marched mightily to a certain country. Although at first, because the generals were cowardly and unwise, they fell into the enemy's trap and suffered several defeats, later someone ran out of the army with a height of eight or nine feet and superhuman strength, volunteered, and the enemy general became a ghost under his knife. Therefore, the emperor issued an edict to withdraw the troops and rewarded the courtiers. The emergence of this kind of literature is by no means accidental. The background is the rampant desire to conquer among the general public at that time. In addition, there is also a kind of literature aimed at eliminating traitors because the national consciousness of the literati at that time was unclear, and some people had the fear of "Yi becoming China." Therefore, they wrote many novels and dramas against traitors. Yue Zhuan can be the representative of this kind of literature. Qin Hui, shaped in Yue Zhuan, is the standard traitor they opposed.</p>
<p>This is just one example. In fact, this kind of example is too numerous to mention. For example, before Poland regained its independence, its literature was all about promoting national self-help. The literature at the time when Korea had just been destroyed was all about the ideal of restoring the Three Hans. The literature after the Russian October Revolution was all about carrying the slogan of "Capitalism attacking Soviet Russia." They all sufficiently prove that literature and its background are inseparable. What kind of background there is, what kind of literature should be produced.</p>
<p>Looking at the development of literature from a purely social point of view, it is also different in each country according to its social ideology. For example, why do Dickens's novels and Shakespeare's dramas mostly depict the dark side of society? There is no other reason. It is because the society in England at that time was so dark that they wanted to arouse the awareness of the general public to transform society. Therefore, he could not but work hard to criticize the dark society.</p>
<p>In short, the most important thing in studying literature is to understand the background of the literature. If you can understand its background, then you can know its central consciousness, and your own path forward will not be blocked by "preconceived ideas."</p>

<p>Yesterday (the 21st) was the thirteenth day of the National Reading Movement. Mr. Pan Gongzhan, the president of Chenbao (Morning Post), specially invited scholars and celebrities from this city to the Shanghai United Club for the supplementary publication of the newspaper "Chenyi" (Morning Ant) to hold a "Reading Guidance Symposium." Those who arrived included Huang Zao Xiong, Li Shaozhe, Wu Zifu, Hu Huaichen, Shen Pengfei, Zhu Yingpeng, Wang Xinming, Chen Zehua, Tai Shuangqiu, Tao Youchuan, Zhang Ziping, He Bingsong, Sun Hanbing, Chen Gaochu, Liu Baimin, Fan Zhongyun, Tong Xingbai, Zhao Jingshen, Ye Qing, Cao Juren, Wang Fuquan, Pan Yangyao, and more than fifty others. All of them were highly respected and admired by the general youth. At 3:00 PM, He Xiya first delivered an opening speech on behalf of Chairman Pan Gongzhan, and then the discussion began. The speakers spoke in the order of signing in. The majority opinions were summarized as follows: (1) Reading should focus on practical and useful learning. (2) Attention should be paid to physical health. (3) Young people should read more books related to physical and mental cultivation to stabilize their minds and absorb knowledge that meets the needs of the times, so as to cultivate sound talents to revive the nation. (4) History and geography are most important, law is most relevant to daily use, biographies of celebrities and great men are helpful for cultivating character, learning, and temperament, and natural science is the foundation of cultural history, so they should be read more. Newspapers are especially the place where citizens' common sense lies, so they should form a daily reading habit. (5) In addition to self-cultivation books, working youth should read more books related to their profession to increase their knowledge and skills. (6) Ancient books can be read slowly, but modern academics should be studied at present. (7) Toxic books, such as those about gods and monsters, pornography, and those whose theories are incompatible with the orthodox ideology of the country and the Three Principles of the People, should not be read, so as to avoid endless harm. (8) Reading should be economical and effective, so attention should be paid to methods, that is, selecting the subjects that are needed. For those related to enriching common sense, a broad approach is appropriate, that is, reading extensively. For those subjects that must be studied, a focused approach is appropriate, that is, reading intensively, and it is necessary to propose "self-centeredness" to avoid being aimless. It is also necessary to avoid "nearsightedness" and "astigmatism" in learning, so as to avoid superficiality and disorder. (9) In order to help the majority of those who cannot afford to study, it is appropriate to request the opening of public and private libraries to benefit students. More systematic academic lectures should be held, and more publications of the "Reading Guidance" type should be published. The publications can set up two columns, "Book Introduction" and "Academic Correspondence Q&amp;A," in order to effectively take on the responsibility of guidance. It is best to have specialized scholars classify and review them accurately to introduce them, so as to reduce the energy and time of the majority of readers. The meeting adjourned at about 5:30 PM.</p>

<h3 id="e184">Results of Gold and Silver Import and Export Statistics Over the Past Forty-Six Years: How Much Gold and Silver Does China Still Possess? <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>— Liu Tang</p>
<p>Since the price of gold became expensive and gold flowed out in torrents, and since the price of silver became expensive and silver flowed out in a continuous stream, the question of how much gold and silver China still holds is probably one that cannot be answered with certainty. Foreigners who do not understand our country's situation regard us as a silver-using country and harbor ulterior motives, thinking of using the means of raising the price of silver to fulfill their ambition of absorption and manipulation. Unscrupulous merchants and vagrants, seizing the opportunity, engage in smuggling and tax evasion, committing all kinds of evils. After enduring hardship, we have no other choice but to struggle hard. As for the situation of gold and silver inflows and outflows, which is closely related to us, we must examine it thoroughly.</p>
<p>The only figures that can be verified for gold and silver inflows and outflows are from customs records. However, according to the "Statistics of China's International Trade in the Past Sixty-Five Years," the customs report's statistical table of gold, silver, and copper imports and exports began in the twentieth year of the Guangxu reign (1904); before that, it was only mentioned in the reports. According to the statistical table, from the fifteenth year of the Guangxu reign (1889) to the seventeenth year of the Republic of China (1928), in these forty years, there were twenty-seven years with a gold surplus and twelve years with a deficit (the twenty-ninth year of the Guangxu reign, i.e., 1903, was balanced). For silver, from the sixteenth year of the Guangxu reign (1890) to the seventeenth year of the Republic of China, a total of thirty-nine years, there were twenty-five years with a surplus and fourteen years with a deficit. From this, it can be seen that there were more years with a gold surplus, while silver had more years with a surplus. The table below is a compilation of the annual surplus and deficit figures of gold (forty years) and silver (thirty-nine years) recorded in the statistical table, as well as the net value after offsetting the total surplus and deficit figures.</p>
<p>(Unit: Customs Taels)</p>
<p>Table 1: Net Amount of Gold and Silver Imports and Exports from the Fifteenth Year of Guangxu (Sixteenth Year for Silver) to the Seventeenth Year of the Republic of China.</p>
<p>Gold Surplus 200,761,920 Silver Surplus 194,931,612</p>
<p>Gold Deficit 104,001,703 Silver Deficit 822,109,039</p>
<p>Net Surplus 96,760,217 Net Deficit 627,177,427</p>
<p>If 1.5 is converted into silver dollars, the net gold surplus is worth 145,140,325 yuan, and the net silver deficit is 930,766,140 yuan. The difference is still a deficit of 785,625,815 yuan.</p>
<p>From the eighteenth year of the Republic of China (1929), the import and export figures for gold and silver are not included in the statistical table. According to the customs trade records, up to the twenty-second year of the Republic of China, the table is shown on the left:</p>
<p>(Unit: National Currency) Table 2: Net Amount of Gold and Silver Imports and Exports in the Five Years from the Eighteenth Year of the Republic of China</p>
<p>Gold Surplus 257,556,760 Silver Surplus 19,952,275</p>
<p>Gold Deficit None Silver Deficit 346,193,837</p>
<p>Net Surplus 257,556,760 Net Deficit 326,241,562</p>
<p>During these five years, the price of gold was very high, so there was a surplus every year. Silver, on the other hand, began to change to a surplus from the twenty-first year. Last year (the twenty-third year), under the influence of the American silver policy, the impact intensified. The huge surplus may also set a record unprecedented in history. However, the customs records for the twenty-third year have not yet been published. According to reports, the figures released by the customs are shown below.</p>
<p>Table 3: Net Amount of Gold and Silver Imports and Exports in the Twenty-Third Year of the Republic of China (1934) (Gold is calculated in Customs Gold Units, Silver is calculated in National Currency)</p>
<p>Gold Import 5,856 Silver Import 4,571,543</p>
<p>Gold Export 26,222,399 Silver Export 233,345,684</p>
<p>Surplus 26,216,543 Surplus 228,774,141</p>
<p>Looking at the above table, last year's gold and silver had a surplus. Gold was worth 26,216,523 Customs Gold Units, and silver was worth 228,774,141 yuan. Gold was almost entirely shipped to the United Kingdom, and silver also went to the United Kingdom the most, with 130 million yuan, the United States with 36 million yuan, and Japan with 10 million yuan. As for the situation in the first quarter of this year, according to reports, it is as follows:</p>
<p>Table 4: Net Amount of Gold and Silver Imports and Exports in the First Quarter of the Twenty-Fourth Year of the Republic of China (Units are the same as the above table)</p>
<p>Gold Import 76,666 Silver Import 3,596,500</p>
<p>Gold Export 13,969,110 Silver Export 100</p>
<p>Surplus 13,892,444 Deficit 3,596,400</p>
<p>The above-mentioned silver was all shipped from Hong Kong, the exported gold was shipped to the United Kingdom, and the imported gold came from Japan.</p>
<p>In the twenty-third year of the Republic of China, one Customs Gold Unit was approximately 1.9 National Currency Units. In the first quarter of this year, it was 1.799. Now, let us use 1.8 to convert the surplus value of gold for one year and one quarter into National Currency Units, totaling 72,196,141 yuan. Another table is compiled below:</p>
<p>Table 6: Net Amount of Gold and Silver Imports and Exports Over the Past Forty-Six Years (Forty-Five Years for Silver) (Unit: National Currency) From the Fifteenth Year of Guangxu (1889) to the First Quarter of the Twenty-Fourth Year of the Republic of China (1935)</p>
<p>Gold Surplus 630,895,781 Silver Surplus 541,123,834</p>
<p>Gold Deficit 156,002,554 Silver Deficit 1,582,953,795</p>
<p>Net Surplus 474,893,227 Net Deficit 1,041,829,961</p>
<p>In these forty-six years, gold had a deficit for only twelve years and a surplus for a total of thirty-three years. After offsetting the surplus and deficit, the surplus reached a huge value of 474,893,227 yuan. I am afraid that even if China has any gold reserves, they are already very few. Looking at the spot gold swap in April of this year, the final result was that the bulls had to pay in, which shows the scarcity of gold.</p>
<p>In these forty-five years, silver had a surplus for seventeen years and a deficit for twenty-eight years. After offsetting the surplus and deficit, the deficit still reached 1,041,829,961 yuan. If this is divided among the 440 million people, each person would only get about two yuan. Although the old silver reserves in China are not included, the small amount is already clearly visible. Why still arouse people's covetousness, wanting to force the Chinese people to have no gold or silver at all? Then China will certainly not be good, but will they also benefit?</p>
<h3 id="e185">New Trends in International Trade Deficits <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Jieqiong</p>
<p>The deficit in international trade is a serious threat to China's economy. Without the accumulation of huge deficits over the years, the outflow of silver would not have been as turbulent and dangerous as it has been in the past year. Since the imposition of export duties on silver, silver has been temporarily detained in the country. However, if human efforts are relaxed even slightly, or if there are more drastic changes in the international market, the outflow of silver can occur at any time. For example, recently, the United States has once again raised the price of silver. Although our country's customs prohibitions are strict, the smuggling of silver in Tianjin, Xiamen, and other places still cannot be stopped. Furthermore, if the deficit phenomenon is not eliminated, even if silver exports stop due to taxation, there will eventually be a need to transport cash for export sooner or later in order to balance the trade deficit. Therefore, those who discuss China's financial problems in recent times invariably seek the root cause and focus on the trade deficit that has persisted for years.</p>
<p>The trade deficit is an important crux of the current deteriorating financial and economic situation and a tool for imperialists to control China's finance and economy. To break the current precarious financial and economic situation and to remove the superior control of foreigners, eliminating the deficit is the most important task at present. Therefore, the steps and methods to be taken are issues that we should study. This article is willing to explain the recent trends in international trade deficits based on facts, so that the Chinese people can have a deeper understanding of this important issue.</p>
<p>In the past two years, the value of the deficit has gradually decreased. This is something that everyone knows, and the degree of reduction is very rapid. Not only is the absolute value of the deficit declining rapidly, but the relative value is also declining rapidly. Let us look at the following facts. (Unit: Thousand Yuan)</p>
<p>1931 1933 1935</p>
<p>Deficit Value in Three Years 877,168 733,146 494,451</p>
<p>Percentage of Deficit Value to Total Trade Volume 36.0% 37.5% 31.6%</p>
<p>The first line represents the absolute value. Last year's deficit was 380 million yuan less than the highest record in 1932 and 240 million yuan less than in 1933. The amount cannot be said to be insignificant. The second line represents the relative value. We know that in recent years, the total value of our country's trade has been declining rapidly, and the decline in the deficit is even faster, especially last year. In 1933, the deficit accounted for 37.5% of the total trade value, while last year it only accounted for 31.6%. This shows that the reduction in the deficit is faster than the reduction in the total trade volume.</p>
<p>However, what has been said above is still the surface value. What about the real exports and imports (i.e., the exports and imports of goods)? To understand the trend of the real deficit more clearly, we must further analyze it.</p>
<p>The trade volume we usually speak of refers to the value of the goods traded, and the deficit amount refers to the numerical value of the deficit, not the quantity of goods. The value of goods is the result of multiplying the quantity of goods by the price. Truly, to understand the trend of the deficit, we must eliminate the changes in prices to observe the situation of real quantity moving in and out. The following table observes the changes in quantity after eliminating prices. The result of dividing the export and import values by the export and import price indices can represent the trend of quantity. The result of dividing the value index by the price index is the quantity index. The last line is the situation of quantity inflow and outflow with 1926 as the base year. The reason why it should be marked with 1926 as the base year is because we are using the index with 1926 as the base period.</p>
<p>1932 1933 1934</p>
<p>(1) Import Value (Unit: Thousand Yuan, same below) 1,63,073 1,343,668 919,663</p>
<p>(2) Import Value Index (1926 as base period, same below) 93.3 76.8 53.1</p>
<p>(3) Import Price Index 140.2 132.2 132.0</p>
<p>(4) Quantity after eliminating price changes (i.e., dividing 1 by 3) 1,164,816 1,015,622 704,296</p>
<p>(5) Import Quantity Index (i.e., dividing 2 by 3) 66.6 58.1 40.2</p>
<p>(6) Export Value 765,956 611,822 535,32</p>
<p>(7) Value Index 57.0 45.4 39.8</p>
<p>(8) Export Price Index 90.4 82.0 71.7</p>
<p>(9) Quantity after eliminating prices (i.e., dividing 6 by 8) 847,197 746,124 746,460</p>
<p>(10) Export Quantity Index (i.e., dividing 7 by 8) 73.1 55.3 55.5</p>
<p>(11) Quantity Inflow and Outflow with 1926 as the Calculation Base (10) Deficit (11) Surplus 37,519 (10) 369,498 (11) 42,170</p>
<p>This table shows several important facts. First, the import price last year was not much different from the previous year, but the import value last year declined significantly. This shows that all the reduction was in quantity. This is very obvious. The value of goods is obtained by multiplying the price by the quantity. If the value of goods decreases significantly while the price remains unchanged, it is sufficient to show that what has changed is completely the third number, that is, the quantity. Second, the export quantity last year not only did not decrease compared to the previous year, but even increased slightly. This can be seen from the export quantity index. The index for the previous year was 55.3, while last year it was 55.5, an increase of 0.2. However, the export value last year also decreased. Since there was no decline in quantity, the reason for the decrease in value must be entirely due to changes in price.</p>
<p>This is a very noteworthy fact. On the import side last year, the price did not change, and what decreased was the import quantity. On the export side last year, the quantity did not change, and what decreased was only the price. Therefore, after eliminating the changes in prices, the export and import quantities are seen to be closer to each other. In other words, the real quantity deficit is far less than what is expressed on the value of goods.</p>
<p>Secondly, we compare the export and import values after eliminating the changes in prices. If we take 1926 as the calculation benchmark, last year's quantity was no longer a deficit, but a surplus.</p>
<p>Therefore, we have arrived at a very important conclusion here, namely, that the deficit value in recent times has gradually decreased, and in fact, the quantity deficit is even smaller. The large decline in the trade value last year was entirely due to the decrease in the quantity of imports. As for the import prices, there was no decline. On the export side, the reason for the decline was entirely due to the drop in export prices. As for the export quantity, it not only did not decrease last year, but even increased slightly.</p>
<p>Why does this phenomenon occur? We should explain it. Last year, due to the rise in the price of silver, our country's currency increased in value invisibly. Logically, foreign goods imported into our country, calculated in our currency, should have seen their prices fall. That is to say, the price of imports must have fallen. The main reason why they did not fall is that the prices in various countries gradually rose last year, which was enough to offset the price drop in our market. Therefore, last year's import prices did not fall further. As for the sudden decline in the quantity of imports, it was the result of the extreme decline in the purchasing power of the people. They simply did not have the ability to buy, which caused a very large decline in the quantity of imports. As for the export side, the reason why the export quantity was able to stop declining was partly due to the fact that the world's economic situation turned to prosperity, and the demand for our country's goods showed an increase. Another reason was that exporters tried their best to lower export prices in order to survive by any means. The very large drop in export prices last year was partly due to this point, and another reason was due to the currency devaluation policies of various countries. Because of the devaluation of currencies in various countries, our goods, after being transported to foreign countries, were priced in foreign currencies, and the prices increased invisibly, making them impossible to sell. In order to maintain their businesses, exporters had no choice but to drastically lower export prices. This is the most important reason for the crazy drop in export prices last year.</p>
<p>The above is an explanation of the conclusions we obtained earlier. What will the situation be like in the future? This is what we should also speculate on in this article.</p>
<p>According to the results of our analysis, the reduction in imports in recent years is entirely due to the reduction in the quantity of imports. There has not been much change in the price. Therefore, the reduction in the deficit in recent years is entirely due to the reduction in the quantity of imported goods. The reason for this is that the people do not have the ability to buy. We speculate that within a considerable period of time, there is no reason for the purchasing power of the people to increase out of thin air, because judging from the current situation, the national economy is on the road to fragmentation, and it is natural that the purchasing power of the people will decrease day by day. As the purchasing power of the people decreases day by day, the quantity of foreign goods needed will also decrease day by day. Therefore, the future import value has a tendency to decrease again. As for the export side, because the world market has improved, and the demand for our country's goods may increase, it seems that the quantity of our country's exports has the hope of rebounding with the recovery of the world economy. As for export prices, it is temporarily impossible to recover and rise due to the pressure of the currency policies of various countries. From this, we believe that imports have the possibility of decreasing again, and exports seem to have the hope of rebounding. Therefore, it is highly probable that the deficit amount will decrease again.</p>
<p>In summary, the trade deficit value has been decreasing day by day in recent years, and the quantity deficit after eliminating price changes has decreased even more. The decline in imports last year was entirely due to the shortage of quantity, while the decline in exports was entirely due to the drop in prices. The purely quantity deficit is in fact much lower than the deficit expressed by the numerical value, and the future trend is that the deficit amount is expected to fall again. This is the conclusion we have reached through analysis.</p>
<p>However, the reduction in the deficit amount does not mean that we can be optimistic. We must not forget that this is the result of the people's poverty and oppression. And we must not think that because the deficit has decreased, the deficit will no longer be a problem in the future. Today, the people's ability to bear the burden is far from what it used to be. Although today's deficit amount is decreasing very rapidly, the decline in the people's ability to bear the burden is even faster. In comparison, the people's deficit burden is still becoming heavier day by day. The deficit is still an important issue at present and does not lose its importance due to the reduction in the amount. How to solve it still needs to be studied. What has been said above is only a report on the real trend of the deficit.</p>
<h3 id="e186">New Ways to Develop Export Trade <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>— Kong Dian</p>
<p>I.</p>
<p>In recent years, China's foreign trade has suffered a sharp decline in exports, leading to a dramatic increase in the deficit, and the outflow of cash has been endless. If this continues, the national economy will undoubtedly wither and decline. Some people in the current era are discussing the idea of organizing export credit insurance to develop future foreign trade. Therefore, I will briefly describe its outline as follows:</p>
<p>Export credit insurance is a special system aimed at filling the risks of export credit. In detail, it means that if the foreign importer who is the payer of the draft issued by the exporter for collecting goods goes bankrupt or refuses to pay, the insurance industry, as a third party, will bear a certain amount of compensation to the issuer or the discount bank. The so-called export risks can be analyzed into two types:</p>
<p>First, those who are unable to pay. The reasons for this can be divided into bankruptcy and extraordinary incidents.</p>
<p>(1) The risk caused by bankruptcy is called bankruptcy risk. It is mostly caused by the bankruptcy of the buyer. For the benefit of the exporter, if there is no third party to provide protection for this kind of occasional and unavoidable fact, there will inevitably be concerns about the operation of international trade, and they will not dare to boldly do it. Therefore, the content of export credit insurance at the beginning mostly focused on underwriting this kind of risk as its main business. As for what kind of state is called bankruptcy, ordinary laws have detailed regulations. As long as this kind of provision is stated in the insurance policy, it can be used as the key to solving problems in the future. Also, even if the buyer has not reached bankruptcy, but his financial situation is on the verge of desperation, and he has to announce the clearing of accounts, so that all or part of the debt cannot be paid, it can be regarded as quasi-bankruptcy. It should be stipulated in the insurance policy that the policyholder can transfer the continuation of the debt entrustment (Abandonment) to the insurer and obtain its compensation.</p>
<p>(2) When the foreign importer of the buyer is unable to perform his debts due to war, floods, earthquakes, and government issuance of payment extension orders, it is called extraordinary risk (Catastropherrik). If importers are caught in a whirlpool, they will inevitably be unable to get rid of it and fall into a desperate situation of bankruptcy, transferring their losses to the exporter without a doubt. However, although relying on insurance is extremely important, ordinary credit insurance companies are usually exempt from their responsibilities for the occurrence of irresistible accidents. Therefore, whether the underwriting of extraordinary risks should be done by the power of the state has become a problem.</p>
<p>Second, those who refuse to pay. The reasons for refusing to pay may be due to poor quality or late delivery, resulting in the buyer's unwillingness to pick up the goods, or due to the drop in the price of goods or the tight money supply, the inability to transfer the payment, and the desire to return the goods, resulting in the refusal to accept the draft. Although the former cannot be used as the purpose of concluding an insurance contract, it is not easy to predict the risk of the latter, unless the reason for its occurrence can be attributed to the buyer. In general, it is not included in the scope of underwriting.</p>
<p>II.</p>
<p>From the perspective of private economy, the most effective strategy in export trade is to meet the hopes of overseas customers in general trading conditions such as goods, prices, and payment methods, and to be better than other competitors. If this can be done, then without solicitation, people will scramble to inquire in order to achieve the success of their transactions. However, whether the quality and price of goods can be better and cheaper is always governed by various conditions, and it is not easy to achieve overnight. However, the method of payment can be changed artificially. For example, if the payment for goods has always been short-term, it can now be changed to long-term, or documentary bills. If the buyer is required to pay the goods before handing them over (Documents against payment) (referred to as Dp), it can now be changed to Documents against acceptance (referred to as DA). The buyer only needs to promise to pay the amount stated on the bill in the future, and it will be handed over to him, so that after the goods are picked up, he can engage in selling them on the one hand and returning the goods on the other. Since there is no inconvenience of temporarily raising funds to purchase goods, who would not want to purchase their goods and be happy to promote them. However, if this is followed, not to mention that exporters have limited capital and are unable to engage in this long-term credit sale, the risks they bear are very large. If the buyer encounters other reasons during this period, resulting in the declaration of bankruptcy, or even using other reasons to delay payment, who can bear this as a profit-making trader. This is in terms of the exporter. The importance of export credit insurance is so great. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e187">Finance: Sunday Call Loan Rate Remains the Same—Subsidiary Coin Situation Remains Stable— <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday was Sunday, and it was also a holiday for foreign banks, so trading felt even quieter. However, although the money industry was in this bank holiday period, the market atmosphere was still strong due to the approaching end of the fourth quarter and the need was more urgent. Yongxingzhuang even went bankrupt the night before because it could not circulate funds, and it was also seen that the internal situation was still unable to loosen. In yesterday's market, the interbank overnight loan rate in the morning and afternoon markets was still the same at one dime, the same as in the past few days. The trading volume of discounted bills was more than 3.4 million in the morning market, and the new transaction was more than 300,000. The transaction volume in the afternoon market was more than 200,000. The transaction volume in the Small General Association was more than 600,000. The foreign mortgage loan transaction took redemption of more than 300,000 and made a new deposit of more than 400,000. The remittance of foreign public bills received by money houses was more than 19 million, and the fraud of various routes was more than 200,000. As for the bank's reception, it was completely stopped because it was a holiday. The subsidiary currency situation was still very stable. The price of small silver coins in Jiangsu and Zhejiang was 836 yuan in the morning and afternoon markets, with no difference from the previous day. The number of transactions made was 3,000 dimes in the morning market and 2,000 dimes in the afternoon market. The price of small silver coins in Guangdong fell 8 dimes in the morning market, to 734 yuan, and recovered 5 dimes in the afternoon market, to 734 yuan and 5 dimes. The result was still 3 dimes smaller than the previous day. The number of transactions made was 120,000 dimes in the morning market and 40,000 dimes in the afternoon market. The price of copper coins increased by 1,000 texts compared to the previous market, to 336,500 texts. The transaction volume was 30,958 strings of texts, equivalent to 9,200 yuan in foreign currency.</p>

<p>Last week, from April 15th to 20th, at the Chinese Securities Exchange, as the April futures delivery approached, both the bulls and bears maintained a firm defensive posture. Their lines remained unmoved, without either side attempting to crush the other, nor were there any hurried swap transactions. The market situation was almost numb, and the morale of investors was increasingly scattered. Arbitrageurs saw meager profits, so they were not enthusiastic. Speculators found no opportunities to exploit, so they mostly stayed on the sidelines. Superficially, due to the loosening of credit by the three banks and the financial accommodations from the "four bottoms" (referring to basic industries), there seemed to be hope for a slight recovery in finance and commerce. However, in reality, the special increase in American silver prices had a significant impact. Talk of a British pound loan seemed like a mirage, desirable but unattainable. Only the government's efforts to rescue the financial situation were highly active. In the near future, there should be a clear demonstration of progress. The public bond market, in this uncertain and confusing period, was also caught in a chaotic and swirling pattern. Regarding the 96 Public Bonds, it was rumored that certain prominent figures ("鉅公") were unable to cover their large short positions, so there were initial rumors of it not being listed on the exchange, followed by rumors of old bonds being universally accepted. All sorts of news were unfavorable for the bulls. One side was trying to suppress the price, so the future outlook must still show some decline. Due to the large short positions that were not covered, prices will ultimately be unable to rise. The week progressed with a weak market on Monday after settlement, with minimal fluctuations. On Tuesday, due to the surge in American silver, floating long positions emerged, resulting in a small gain of about half a yuan. On Wednesday, there was some short-covering and swapping, recovering about half a yuan. From Thursday to Saturday, the situation was extremely chaotic, with stagnant trading, and no significant fluctuations occurred even as the delivery date approached. Only the 96 Public Bonds saw a sudden increase in trading volume due to various rumors, and a downward trend gradually began. The future situation, having been brewing for too long, is such that if a slight crack appears, there will inevitably be a surge. Overall, the week's market price results showed that fluctuations were only one or two jiao (tenths of a yuan), with declines generally outnumbering gains. The total transaction volume was 59,959,500 yuan, plus 7,000 yuan in spot transactions. The results of the price changes are compared and listed in the table below (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan):</p>

<p>A report from Xinfeng Foreign Firm states that yesterday (the 20th), the New York stock market trended upward, with both industrial and utility stocks reaching new annual highs. Steel stocks saw particularly strong gains due to a 2% increase in production in Pittsburgh and stabilizing iron prices. It is reported that orders for U.S. Steel Corporation have increased, and traders anticipate that steel production will rise further. Trading within the first hour of the day was the most active first hour of the year. The bond market was mixed but firm. Small exchange stocks rose sharply. Half-day volume was 880,000 shares. The Dow Jones New York indices are as follows:</p>
<p>30 Industrial Stocks 107.97 10.76 Up 1.79</p>
<p>20 Railroad Stocks 30.01 30.56 Up 0.55</p>

<p>Yesterday's sugar market saw the Sugar Association trading 24 bags of coarse refined sugar for transshipment at 5.75 yuan, a rise of 0.15 yuan. Spot price was 17.35 yuan, and this firm's stock was 17.43 yuan. Outgoing shipments were lacking, and the outlook is for continued tightness. Taikoo's "0" mark sugar was still quoted at 17.80 yuan. The firm's fine white sugar remained at the original price. Chaoqing dealers wanted to raise prices, but actual sales were not moving, leading to a standoff between the two sides.</p>

<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the sources from various groups suddenly became scarce again, with only about twenty shipments arriving (a total of over 4,000 shi). The initial market was still weak, but when scarcity was observed, confidence began to gradually recover. Wholesale transactions were somewhat active, with about 600-700 bags from Qingdao and Yantai groups being purchased. The situation turned stable, and by the close of the market, it had completely settled. The prices of both thick japonica and thin indica rice were unchanged, while the flow of Yinyuan rice was unremarkable and slightly weak. Bianyuan rice was out of stock and unavailable.</p>

<h3 id="e193">On Poetry <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>— Jiang Jiping</p>
<p>Suiyuan Shihua discusses the need for poetry to be "winding," which is similar to Wang Guowei's concept of "unconstrained." However, I believe that when writing poetry, one might as well be nosy and foolish. For example, "The sound of wind and rain came last night; who knows how many flowers have fallen" is being nosy, but it is done well. Another example is Chen Chunan's inscription on a painting of a beautiful woman's back:</p>
<p>"The beauty leans against a jade闽干 (railing), regretting that her beautiful face is hard to see; I call out to her several times, but she doesn't turn around; with foolish heart, I want to turn the painting around to see."</p>
<p>The merit lies in knowingly being a painting, but still wanting to turn it around to see. This is foolish, but this foolishness is a poetic foolishness.</p>
<p>There is a section in Suiyuan Shihua discussing the winding nature of poetry, which can greatly inspire one's spirit. It says, "Someone asked, 'How can poetry be considered winding?' I replied: 'There are countless examples of winding ancient poetry. For example, the recent poem by Wang Ziyuan visiting a friend says: 'Restless crows settle down at the third watch of the night, a single silver lamp shines brightly upstairs; I remember arriving at the door but not knocking, quietly listening to the sound of reading in the flower shade.' This is winding. If he had knocked upon arriving at the door, it would have been straightforward. Fang Mengzhang's poem visiting a friend says: 'A light boat winds through misty clouds, I love even more the flowers filling the valleys before the mountain; not only am I not seeking you, I also linger, not knowing your home is within the flowers.' This is winding. If he had known it was 君家 (your home) from the start, it would have been straightforward. A Song dynasty poem about plum blossoms says: 'Green willows, understanding language, should laugh at each other, who exactly leaked the spring light?' A poem about red plum blossoms says: 'A shepherd boy wakes up with drowsy eyes, mistakenly recognizing the peach grove, wanting to release the cattle.' Thinking of the heart of willows and the eyes of shepherd boy when writing about plum blossoms is winding. If it only focused on plum blossoms, it would be straightforward.'"</p>
<p>What is meant by "winding" is having a different and beautiful realm in the poem, something that others would not think of. It is as if one has reached the source of a stream, and the road ahead is blocked by a mountain, as if "this road leads nowhere," but suddenly turning around, going around the mountain, there is a sudden opening, with many beautiful sights that one cannot take in at a glance. At this time, the person reading the poem naturally receives a kind of joy. This is what is meant by "unconstrained," "winding," "having divine charm," "spirit," and "humor." Whatever one calls it is fine. Good poems have no difference; whether it is new poetry or old poetry, criticism of poetry cannot deviate from the above ways of expression.</p>
<p>Poetry is something that should be written when one is moved. If someone gives a topic, there will definitely be no masterpieces. If we open Tang poetry to look, is there even one good poem written in response to imperial command? Yuan Zicai said: "Poems without titles are the music of heaven; poems with titles are the music of man. The music of heaven is easy to achieve, while the music of man is difficult. The three hundred poems of the Book of Songs and the Nineteen Old Poems are all works without titles. Later people took the first one or two characters from the poem and made it the title, thus making them uniquely outstanding for thousands of years. From the Han and Wei dynasties onward, poetry only had titles, and emotions gradually weakened. By the Tang dynasty, there were five-character eight-rhyme examination poems limited by rules and regulations, and emotions became even more distant." What is meant by having poetry without a title is that the emotion must be at its peak. Poems written in this way must be works of spirit. I believe that writing poetry is like making friends. Two good friends get together, sit knee to knee, and pour out their hearts. They feel that every word and sentence they say to each other is very touching, and every sentence is filled with rich emotions. Even if they talk until late at night, they show no signs of weariness. Writing poetry when we are moved is also like this. Sometimes, waking up in the winter night, hearing several desolate and clear clapper sounds outside, or on a clear spring morning, seeing the willow branches on the riverbank swaying in the wind, suddenly, one's heart stirs, and the poetic lines in one's chest seem like the rolling river water about to flow out of the embankment. It is truly unpleasant not to pour them out. This is when the spirit arrives. If one writes poetry without being moved, it is like dealing with a disliked friend. The more one dislikes them, the more one feels there is nothing to say. Even if one can say a few words, they are perfunctory words that are irrelevant. Both feel bored and wish they could quickly get away. Hardship in writing is like this. One sits at the desk, pen in hand, unable to find half a sentence. One walks around the walls and flips through books, but also gains nothing. Writing poetry in this way is truly a torture of life. Jia Dao, a famous hardship poet of the Tang dynasty, had a line saying:</p>
<p>"Two lines take three years to obtain, one sigh brings forth tears; if the appreciator</p>
<p>does not admire them, I will return to sleep in the old mountains in autumn."</p>
<p>He first misunderstood the purpose of writing poetry. The ancients said, "Poetry expresses intention." What is meant by "expressing intention" is expressing one's own emotions and saying what one wants to say. Whether others appreciate it or not is their business, what does it have to do with me? For the sake of others' appreciation, refusing to say one's own words is destroying one's spirit and will definitely not produce good lines. No wonder it takes him "three years to obtain two lines." Looking at the poems of the ancients, those who can express their own opinions all have their own individuality, not echoing what others say. In fact, things are already outdated, but after being described by his pen and expressing his unique opinion, they can still shine brightly. This is the benefit of being able to say one's own words. For example, Li Bai's poem "If only Guan Zhong were always alive, why not have six more ladies in the palace!" Yang Chengzhai's poem says, "I only wish the monarch would execute Zai Pi, not worrying about Xi Shi in the palace." A Tang dynasty poem praising Emperor Minghuang says, "If Yao and Song had not lost the imperial concubine, how could the barbarian dust have reached China!" Emperor Xizong's poem when fleeing to Shu says, "Aman (Cao Cao) in the underworld should have something to say, this time he should no longer blame Yang Guifei." Fan Tongshu's poem says, "If the prime minister of Wu were still here, the King of Yue would have sent the beauty in vain." A Tang dynasty poem says, "The King of Wu did everything upside down, Xi Shi may not be superior to the six palace ladies." These poems all have their own opinions, not relying on the ancients, so they are exceptionally novel. Some people may clearly have this kind of opinion, but they dare not say it, that is still being unwilling to say their own words.</p>
<h3 id="e194">Night Talk on a Boat <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>— Tang Xiru</p>
<p>I took the last scheduled steamer from Wuxi to go home. I heard that there wouldn't be any more tomorrow, because the river water was too shallow. Not only were the farmers along the way opposed to the operation of the steamers (because it could easily damage the dragon-bone water lifts), but even the petty-minded steamer owners were advocating suspending the service. Because even if the boat was running slowly, as slow as a snail crawling, they still had to be careful all the time that there weren't any rocks on the riverbed that would bite off a piece of the bottom of the boat.</p>
<p>From sunrise to sunset, I barely managed to endure until Heqiao. From here to my home, there were still more than twenty li of waterway, but the steamer didn't go along this route, so I had to hire a rowboat.</p>
<p>This time, my father had hired a boat from our hometown to pick me up, so I was spared a lot of trouble. I walked across the gangplank of the steamer in the fine rain, stepped onto the gangplank of the rowboat, and asked the boatman to go ashore to buy some noodles and porridge to fill our stomachs. Then the boat immediately set off again in the dense darkness of the night.</p>
<p>I hadn't been back for seven or eight years, so my father was busy telling me about the changes in our hometown over the years. Who had died, who had taken up opium, what shops had closed down. Who had joined the Green Gang and even become a leader, with as many as two or three hundred disciples, rampaging through the area. All were trivial news, gray news, news that was both surprising and stifling.</p>
<p>The boat rowed less than three li out of Heqiao Town, and the boat window immediately became lively and bright. Torches, safety lamps, lanterns. So many on both sides of the bank that they looked like stars. The wheezing of the water pumps, the dry howling of the dragon-bone water lifts, the shouts of the farmers, the frenzied barking of the village dogs, and the shadowy figures coming and going all combined to compose a piece of music that made one want to commit suicide, and formed a picture that made one want to weep. The more desperately they struggled, the more they showed their greatness, and at the same time, how bitter and pitiful they were!</p>
<p>The lights faded away, and the sounds also faded away. We had already reached the famous large river in the area. The villagers here seemed to depend entirely on the bounty of this river, and now they could rest at night. All around was quiet, and the moonlight came out, illuminating clumps of tree shadows and blocks of dark roof shadows, sleeping wearily. If it weren't for the wheat-like reality we had just encountered, this would have been the most ideal moonlit night scene like a lyrical poem. But....</p>
<p>"Damn you! Are you asleep? Row to the middle of the river! Do you want to run aground on the shoal? There was a loud scolding from someone in the stern, and at the same time, there was the sound of a bamboo pole poking into the water from the bow of the boat.</p>
<p>I had been listening to the tired creaking of the oars for so long that I was almost asleep.</p>
<p>Suddenly, my father leaned out of the window, knocked the soot out of his pipe on the windowsill, cleared his throat, and said, "We're almost there! Let's go to the bow of the boat to clear our heads."</p>
<p>We went to the bow of the boat and sat down. Suddenly, my father said to me in a low voice, "That...that's it in front of us, on the riverbank to the left. There's a white coffin. That's the policeman who was beaten to death by the hooligans.... They tricked him into going out to catch gamblers and beat him to death.... What a pity! He wasn't even twenty-eight years old yet..."</p>
<p>After saying that, my father stood up, turned his back to the left, muttered the words "The wronged have their avengers, the debtors have their creditors," cleared his throat again, deliberately coughed a few times, and loudly addressed the boatman:</p>
<p>"Jinlong, there are a few black clouds in the southwest corner! It's going to be a downpour tomorrow."</p>
<p>"I hope so! Amitabha! If God doesn't have mercy again, the poor will have no food to eat!"</p>

<p>— Ai Wu</p>
<p>"Let's rest, everyone, let's rest! ...It's so hot!"</p>
<p>The man called Boss Qin by his companion stopped and took a breath. While lifting his right foot to loosen the area where his straw sandals had rubbed and caused pain, he anxiously shouted loudly to the people who had walked to the other side of the slope. Old Xu, carrying a load of sundries such as foreign thread and needles, immediately stopped, wiped the sweat from his forehead, and said:</p>
<p>"Okay, let's wait for him!"</p>
<p>"Don't mind him, let him suffer a little! ...He's putting on the airs of a big boss here! ...Keep going."</p>
<p>Old Chen turned around and said this, while shrugging the blue cloth bundle on his back, and continued walking forward.</p>
<p>Old Xu smiled, agreed, and shifted the load on his left shoulder to his right, following behind.</p>
<p>Seeing that no one on the other side of the slope responded, Boss Qin thought to himself: These two fellows aren't going to wait for me? He wanted to sit down and rest, but since setting off in the morning, he hadn't seen a single house, and this hillside was full of low evergreen bushes, quiet as if he had entered a primeval forest. He couldn't help but feel afraid and had to endure the pain in his feet and walk forward.</p>
<p>The season was subtropical spring. The miscellaneous trees on the hilltop and in the ditches were all sprouting new buds in their perennial greenness, emitting a light bitter taste and fragrance. Along the way, the leaves were flashing with spots of golden sunlight. There was no wind, and everywhere was sweltering.</p>
<p>Turning past the slope, seeing the backs of the two men walking slowly, Old Qin called out again:</p>
<p>"Hey, don't you two feel heavy? ...It's so hot! ...It's okay for me to be empty-handed!"</p>
<p>"It's okay! It's okay!"</p>
<p>Old Chen turned his head and replied loudly, then turned back and continued walking, smiling gleefully as he whispered to Old Xu:</p>
<p>"Damn, he's saying it's okay for him! Look!"</p>
<p>"Brother Xu, aren't you resting either? ...Just focusing on the road will make you feel heart-stricken! Carrying such a heavy load."</p>
<p>Boss Qin persuaded Old Xu alone. Old Chen whispered:</p>
<p>"Look, he's trying to ingratiate himself with you, don't mind him. He thinks of us all as laborers, bah!"</p>
<p>Old Xu felt it was wrong to ignore others, but he didn't want to stop obediently, so he shifted the load on his shoulder and replied loudly:</p>
<p>"Boss Qin, let's walk a little further before resting, there's no water to drink here!"</p>
<p>Old Chen sarcastically smiled quietly:</p>
<p>"You're the only one who likes to call him boss! ...What boss? He's simply unreliable!"</p>

<p>As the distance lessened, the Xishan Pagoda grew larger in our eyes.</p>
<p>We followed the winding stone steps up the mountain, up the temple. We followed the ancient, dim stairs up the tower, up to the top of the tower.</p>
<p>As the stairs rose higher, the wind grew stronger. A blade of grass, a tree on the top of the mountain, were all moving.</p>
<p>I used my two eyes to look down, to look at everything. I knew that the whole city was so big, so wide, but now it all rushed into my eyes. I could count clearly this building and that building. I knew that a blade of grass on the top of Huishan, a wave in Taihu Lake, a line of people on the mountain path, a car on the road were all moving, all moving. But in my eyes, they had all become solidified things.</p>
<p>I looked at the many mountains like many graves, looked at Taihu Lake like a pond, looked at a six-foot-tall person like a child in a land of little people, looked at the cars and horses like toys.</p>
<p>"Ha, ha, they are all insignificant in my eyes."</p>
<p>I also knew that the society we were in now was a tower, and I was on the top of the tower, so undoubtedly I was the master of this tower. Ha, ha, millions of people are under my feet, under my feet! I kicked my foot on the cement ground, ringing.</p>
<p>I casually threw a remaining cigarette butt down, and it stumbled and rolled in the wind like a drunkard for a long time before landing.</p>
<p>I spat a little saliva casually, and it also stumbled and rolled down.</p>
<p>"Ah, a cigarette butt and a little saliva on the top of the tower also become great!"</p>
<p>My face was glowing.</p>
<p>Dusk urged us down the tower, and we stepped on the winding stone steps again. I knew that the people on the tower at this time were looking at us as insignificant; but when I looked back at the people left on the tower, I also felt that they were insignificant. No, even the tower itself I felt was insignificant. No, even Xishan, I felt was insignificant at all.</p>
<p>A nameless melancholy piled up in my heart.</p>
<p>As the distance increased, the Xishan Pagoda disappeared from our sight.</p>

<p>— (By American J.T. Farrell, Translated by Yi Xian)</p>
<p>— Sketches of American Life —</p>
<p>Tax Fellers was originally a strong shepherd boy from the mountainous region of Greece. His hard-working mother saved up some money, enough to make a trip to America, a country where, according to everyone, the streets are paved with gold, there are grand buildings everywhere, women dress like princesses, men's pockets are full of money, every boy has a bicycle, every man and woman owns a car, and all the houses are like palaces. Tax was tall and strong, and at the age of thirteen, looking older than his age, he arrived in a city in this heaven called Chicago.</p>
<p>As this frightened child sat on the train, a relative came to meet him. This relative took him to their home on South Halsted Street and told him to work in a candy store. Soon, Tax discovered the meaning of life in heaven. It meant working from six in the morning until six in the evening, and even later on Saturdays and Sundays. It meant sweeping the store, washing dishes, wiping doors, cleaning equipment, tidying up, and running errands. It meant attending night school to learn English when his eyes could barely stay open, and constantly being laughed at for not making progress. It meant walking and living in dirty streets, constantly bombarded by the gas, dust, soot, and exhaust fumes from cars, causing him to cough. It meant that whenever he thought of his hometown in the Greek mountains, his mother, and the leisurely days of shepherding, he was overcome with deep loneliness.</p>
<p>For many days after starting at the store, Tax remained a very quiet child. He always thought back to his hometown and the games he played with other children, and he remembered his old mother's smile and kisses. He feared everything about America, the chaotic heavenly life of Chicago. He patiently worked every day, saving five dollars a week, pinching pennies from it to deposit in an immigrant bank. However, he hoped that one day he would become just like an American, speak the same language as them, wear the clothes they wore, ride in cars like them, and take American girls out.</p>
<p>Gradually, Tax learned all sorts of tricks. He learned to speak American, but he couldn't learn to speak it like an American. He realized that he was an unrefined Greek peasant, and many Americans didn't want him or his many compatriots to come to America. He learned that American girls laughed at young Greek peasants. Moreover, he also discovered some places where he could go for two dollars to find American girls who wouldn't laugh at Greek peasants, and he could have fun for at least five or ten cents. He learned when he could buy cheap American clothes, how to wear purple silk shirts and purple socks, and how to tie an orange tie. Gradually, he also learned that he could pocket some of the money he put into the cash register at the store.</p>
<p>Later, the relative who employed him became enraged and fired him, calling him a thief and an ungrateful wretch. Tax was somewhat indignant and retorted that he had made a lot of money selling this shoddy merchandise, and yet he only paid him six dollars a week.</p>
<p>Later, Tax was employed by other compatriots, working in fruit stores, soda fountains, bars, and restaurants. He became increasingly familiar with American society and the American language. Sometimes, he would wear a purple silk shirt and matching socks, tie an orange tie, and stroll in the park or along South Halsted Street, hoping to find a beautiful, pink-skinned, blue-eyed American girl for himself. Sometimes, he would think of his Greek mountain village, dreaming of returning there with American money, and also bringing a girl, perhaps one of these rosy-skinned, young, and beautiful American girls.</p>
<p>Tax spent many years drifting along. He was in his twenties and still carried his original residence permit. He had always worked like a dog, and he continued to do the same odd jobs he had been doing since he came to America. He earned fifteen dollars a week, working twelve hours a day in a candy store. He swept, wiped, scrubbed, tidied, and served customers. Whenever he got a chance, he would pocket some money from the cash register. Every week, he went to the bank to deposit money. He checked his bankbook almost every night, pleased to see his savings grow. However, he could never save up much money, because he often had to take time off work, and then he had to live off his savings until he found a new job.</p>

<h3 id="e198">The Lecithin Smoking Cessation Problem (Lipid-Like Substance Smoking Cessation Problem) (2) <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>— Pang Jingzhou</p>
<p>How did the lecithin smoking cessation method come into being?</p>
<p>Mr. Ma Wenzhao has already explained the principles and process of lecithin smoking cessation as described above. Since then, it has naturally been adopted by smoking cessation hospitals in Nanjing. At the same time, Mr. Ma also conducted a third study on cell metamorphosis to answer questions such as whether the lipid-like substances required by the Golgi apparatus of various cells are related to the increase in platelets and how leukocytes transport lipid-like substances. He still used white mice for experiments, and the main results are as follows:</p>
<p>(A) Morphine may stimulate red blood cells to produce a large number of platelets, as mentioned above, and the important component of platelets is lipid-like substances.</p>
<p>(B) During the withdrawal period, after the increase in platelets, the lipid-like substances in leukocytes also increase, and platelets are found inside anuclear leukocytes. The number of leukocytes in blood vessels greatly decreases, while the number of leukocytes in various organs greatly increases. From this, it is known that leukocytes contain a large number of lipid-like substances or platelets in the bloodstream, transporting them to various organs to supply the remodeling of the Golgi apparatus.</p>
<p>(C) During the craving period, the number of platelets greatly decreases, and leukocytes have nothing to absorb. Therefore, it is found that many are stagnant in the blood vessels, seemingly waiting to absorb lipid-like substances. At the same time, leukocytes in various organs greatly decrease, and the Golgi apparatus also decreases, or even disappears.</p>
<p>(D) After feeding lecithin, leukocytes immediately absorb this lipid-like substance from the intestinal wall to meet needs, without the need for red blood cells to produce a large number of platelets. Therefore, the number of leukocytes retained in the blood vessels is found to decrease, while the number in organs greatly increases again.</p>
<p>The report of this study is detailed in the "Chinese Journal of Physiology," Volume 7, Issue 4, pages 287-342, 1933, entitled "Changes in Leukocytes During Long-Term Morphine Addiction and Treatment in White Mice."</p>
<p>Last year, during the Far Eastern Tropical Medicine Conference in Nanjing, Mr. Ma and two physicians from the Nanjing Municipal Smoking Cessation Hospital jointly published a paper in the proceedings of the conference, entitled "A Comfortable and Spontaneous Cure of Opium Habit by Means of a Lecithin Diet."</p>
<p>According to this clinical experimental report, taking a large amount of lecithin has the possibility of stopping smoking immediately, allowing smokers to quit themselves. It also has eight major effects: mental pleasure, weight gain, smooth bowel movements, stable sleep, strong appetite, rapid reduction of addiction, no withdrawal symptoms, and natural reduction of smoking. From the above two articles, it can be known that researchers were quite satisfied with lecithin as of last year. Therefore, the Ministry of Health sold "Xinsheng Brand Lecithin" products in the Jiangsu and Zhejiang areas last winter. The initial intention of the Ministry of Health was also to promote and popularize smoking cessation. Therefore, the product name was even given the name "Xinsheng" (新生), meaning it aligns with the New Life Movement. However, several steps were missing in the distribution process, so the usage method did not fully comply with the conditions of Mr. Ma's experiments, resulting in the current market being filled with chaotic rumors and rambling criticisms. The sources are described separately as follows:</p>
<p>(A) According to the experiments conducted by Mr. Ma et al. in the municipal hospital, forty drug offenders sent by the court were used as the standard, which is different from ordinary smokers in terms of environment and mentality.</p>

<p>Second item: Farmers' Health Care</p>
<p>Rural health work should prioritize treatment first. Once the people have faith in "new medicine," all long-standing problems can be easily solved. The design of this center for this issue is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Disease Treatment: Outpatient work, mobile treatment, referrals</p>
<p>(2) Health Education: The time spent waiting for consultation is used by the staff of this office.</p>
<p>A. Explain the phenomena and causes of diseases</p>
<p>B. Explain the relationship between disease and people and prevention methods</p>
<p>C. Health problem consultation and answers</p>
<p>(3) Home Visits: A. Patients who have come to the clinic and have special circumstances</p>
<p>B. Impart hygiene knowledge and provide home care</p>
<p>C. Isolation of infectious diseases and disinfection of equipment</p>
<p>D. Connect with farmers' feelings</p>
<p>(4) Plague Prevention Work: A. Fully cooperate with the Nanjing Anti-Malaria Committee</p>
<p>B. Train farmers to fill ditches and polluted water</p>
<p>C. Investigate the number of malaria patients</p>
<p>D. Divide the island and designate it as a medication area</p>
<p>(5) Maternal and Child Health: There is no new method of midwifery on the island, and special attention should be paid to maternal and child health. The implementation plan for this work is as follows:</p>
<p>A. Women's Class: The center's midwife teaches maternal and child health knowledge</p>
<p>B. Family Meetings: Gather housewives from each family together for training in one organization so that they can solve common issues that are close to them, and then be influenced by interest.</p>
<p>B. Training and Registration of Midwives: Management of old-fashioned midwives</p>
<p>D. Midwifery Work: Those who have come to the center for prenatal checkups will receive free midwifery services and postnatal visits.</p>
<p>E. Infant Mortality Investigation: The township office reports to the center, and the center conducts infant mortality investigations during diagnosis and treatment.</p>
<p>(6) Others: Matters related to farmers' health care</p>
<p>Third item: Environmental Sanitation</p>
<p>The quality of environmental sanitation is related to overall health. The occurrence and spread of diseases are closely related to the environment. The points that need to be addressed in terms of environmental sanitation on the island are:</p>
<p>A. Digging Wells: Disinfect the wells daily</p>
<p>B. Constructing Public Toilets: A good method for dealing with indiscriminate defecation. The style should adopt the Javanese toilet.</p>
<p>C. Garbage Disposal: Set up trash cans and collect them at designated times</p>
<p>D. Other Management: Teahouses, restaurants, bathhouses, vegetable markets, barber shops, etc.</p>
<p>Fourth item: Special Work.</p>
<p>A. Train health care workers to complete the township autonomous health care system.</p>
<p>Given the size of the island and the number of people, the distribution of the staff in this office is particularly difficult. If farmers with some knowledge within the island can be given general health training and organization, this problem can be avoided and the great effect of public autonomy can be achieved. It is planned to select outstanding individuals from the graduates of the island's adult class, the children's class, and the women's class, and organize and train them in this office. The method will be detailed in another article.</p>
<p>B. Vital Statistics: Concluded by this office in conjunction with the township office.</p>
<p>Those who manage rural hygiene should integrate education, agriculture, and hygiene into one, which means combining agriculture, education, and hygiene into one, dividing labor and cooperating so that the work is not difficult.</p>
<p>We firmly believe that hygiene is particularly important in the method of rescuing rural areas, because rural areas are the foundation of society, and farmers account for 85% of our country's population. Therefore, if we want to revitalize our nation and save the declining phenomenon, we must first start with farmers' hygiene.</p>
<p>If we want to build a new China and make our people wash away the shame of being the sick men of East Asia, there is no other way than rural hygiene.</p>
<p>Since Xinren first entered rural work, he has had great ambitions for reviving the health of farmers. Because he feels that if he wants to implement rural health work, he should first educate the public about hygiene. Therefore, he drafted the above plan. He dared not publish it to readers before, but "throwing a brick to attract jade" has been a clear motto since ancient times. Moreover, "a rustic's offering of sunshine should not be criticized by gentlemen." Therefore, he hopes to receive guidance from experts from all walks of life.</p>
<h3 id="e200">A Brief History of School Oral Hygiene in Various Countries (3) <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>— Situ Xue</p>
<p>There are many types of school dental management methods in the United States, which can be roughly divided into state-run, city-run, social organizations, or foundation-run. As for school dental facilities, the Forsyth Children's Dental Clinic in Boston and the Rochester Dental Hospital in Rochester City are the greatest and most ideal representatives of central treatment centers. Other cities also have central treatment facilities. The city of Bridgeport is located in the municipal hall, and simple dental clinics are also set up in more than 30 primary schools in the city. In general, they are mostly managed by the Bureau of Education, the Bureau of Health, the Red Cross, and the Tuberculosis Prevention Association.</p>
<p>The school dental facilities in the metropolis are managed as described above. As for the countryside, because it is not easy to set up a central treatment center, mobile dental treatment teams are organized. These mobile teams also adopt various methods. The simple ones only carry folding chairs and hand-held equipment for home visits. In remote areas, cars or carriages are used to set up a simple treatment room inside for mobile home visits, which is very convenient.</p>
<p>Oral Hygiene Movement in France</p>
<p>Oral hygiene facilities in France began on March 23, 1908. According to the decree promulgated by the Bureau of Social Education, all students in primary schools and normal schools must undergo oral examinations and treatment. After the promulgation of this decree, two dentists were appointed to be responsible for the task of examination and treatment. Oral examinations were carried out twice a year, and the oral condition of the examinees was filled in the examination certificate and sent to their parents. However, whether to treat or not was up to them. At that time, there were no school treatment facilities, so those who wanted to be treated mostly went to private dental hospitals that they agreed with for treatment. However, the treating doctor was not restricted by the examining doctor, and the examining doctor only examined the oral condition of the students.</p>
<p>Before the promulgation of this decree, the dental community in France had a strong enthusiasm for promoting the oral hygiene movement, but because the education authorities were indifferent, its development was not as advanced as in England, the United States, and Germany. At that time, little attention was paid to the oral hygiene of primary school children, but students above middle school occasionally received it. In 1908, after the promulgation of this decree, a clause on teeth was added to the prescribed duties of school doctors, ordering school doctors to fill in a detailed record of the oral condition of each student. According to the law, students who will be employed in the education sector or normal schools in the future must undergo two oral examinations a year and be advised to receive treatment. At that time, that was all that was done for oral hygiene, and there was really no contribution. Two years later, middle schools other than normal schools gradually stipulated examinations. As for primary school children, there are still no legal regulations. It was not until the House of Commons put forward a bill to conduct oral examinations for primary school children that it was gradually realized.</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>In 1912, the city of Nice and others began to establish municipal school dental clinics, and charitable organizations, dental medical associations, dental schools, etc. in Paris and other major cities also established them one after another to provide voluntary services.</p>
<p>The French Oral Hygiene Association was founded in 1911. Its purpose is (1) to make the public aware of the importance of oral hygiene, which is not only important for maintaining healthy teeth, but also important for personal physical health, and is also governed by the development of the race. (2) To popularize oral hygiene education to the public through lectures, lantern slides, etc. (3) To implement oral examinations and treatment in schools, military units, and various charitable organizations. The members of this dental hygiene association are not only dentists, but also include knowledge classes such as congressmen, journalists, and educators to work together for development, so oral hygiene in France is progressing day by day.</p>
<h3 id="e201">The Importance of Vitamins to Life (1) <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>— Zhong Zhihe</p>
<p>Vitamins, also known as vitamin elements, are a type of organic substance found in various foods. They were first discovered by Mr. Kasimir Funk twenty-two years ago. Since then, doctors all over the world have studied them carefully and clarified their principles, and only then did they realize that they are necessary elements in the human body's metabolism! Once there is a lack or absence of this type of substance, it is easy to cause various diseases of vitamin deficiency. The importance of vitamins to life is indeed great.</p>
<p>However, many of our compatriots often do not ask for medical knowledge, do not understand how vitamins are classified, and what their functions are, and often buy vitamins as tonics. This is like sailing in the dark without a compass, blindly without knowing where to go. As a result, they only waste money and gain nothing, which is really regrettable.</p>
<p>I, a member of the medical community, do not want my compatriots to fall into this fog any longer, so I wrote this article to tell my compatriots, so that they will have a clear understanding of the value of vitamins in the future, so that they can be used properly and effectively. I hope my compatriots will not neglect it. Here, I will describe vitamins in detail, which I believe my compatriots will be happy to read to the end.</p>

<h3 id="e202">Pain Relief in Medicine (11) <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>— Li Yu</p>
<p>Even normal menstruation can have some pain, but not unbearable pain. What is discussed here is abnormal pain. One treatment for menstrual pain is to use heat, such as applying a hot, moist compress or drinking hot beverages. Secondly, sedatives and pain relievers can be used. Regular bowel movements and practicing personal hygiene can also reduce menstrual pain. Sometimes, surgical correction of the uterine position is necessary.</p>
<p>Back Pain (Lumbago)</p>
<p>Back pain is not a rare ailment. You can see large advertisements for back pain remedies in newspapers. A large portion of plaster sales relies on customers with back pain. Common treatments for back pain are often not aligned with the pathology, so they are often futile. What's going on? Back pain is a very complex problem. Years of research have revealed no fewer than one hundred and twenty causes of back pain. If all types of back pain are treated the same way, good results cannot be expected. Due to space limitations, I cannot describe all the causes of back pain one by one. Here is a brief description of the most important causes: Now, let's talk from the outside in; inflammation of the back muscles can cause back pain. This inflammation often comes from chronic inflammation of the mouth, nose, and throat. From the muscles further inward, there are bones, the spine, and the pelvis; problems with these can also cause back pain. Spinal tuberculosis and common inflammation are also causes of back pain. The spine is made up of more than twenty movable small vertebral segments, and the lower end forms a slightly movable joint with the pelvis. These vertebral segments bear the weight of the upper body, move constantly, and are easily injured accidentally; for example, during pregnancy and childbirth. Women who have many children have more back pain. If the legs are of unequal length or the hip joint is misaligned, causing one side of the spine to bear more weight than the other, it can also cause back pain. Abscesses on the inner surface of the spine or outside the kidney are also commonly mistaken for back pain.</p>
<p>For women, the most common cause of back pain is problems with the organs in the pelvis. For example, endometritis, uterine malposition, oophoritis, salpingitis, pelvic abscesses, uterine tumors, ovarian tumors, etc. Therefore, to treat back pain in women, you must first understand this pathology. If you have back pain and just stick a few plasters on your back, isn't that futile?</p>
<p>Kidney (commonly known as the waist) problems are also a cause of back pain; for example, nephritis, kidney stones, kidney tuberculosis, kidney tumors, wandering kidney, etc. Secondly, people who are particularly obese in the abdomen often have back pain. Tertiary syphilis growing on the spine can also cause back pain.</p>
<p>From this, it can be seen that treating back pain is not a simple matter. Doctors who treat back pain must have sufficient internal medicine knowledge, and they must also be proficient in surgery, orthopedics, gynecology, etc. If patients have medical knowledge, they will not be easily fooled.</p>
<p>There are several standards for treating back pain that must be paid attention to. Don't just stick plasters or take pills when you have back pain. First, you need to know if the spine, vertebral joints, or pelvic joints are inflamed. If it is determined that the above is the cause, treatment requires resting the body, using heat, support, and removing the root cause. If it is bone tuberculosis, it must be treated according to the methods for treating bone tuberculosis. Second, women with back pain must pay attention to uterine disease, such as tumors or problems in the pelvis, which cannot be solved by applying plasters or taking kidney pills. Surgery or gynecological methods must be used to remove the problem before the back pain can be cured.</p>
<p>Third, special attention should be paid to kidney disease. Common people often mistake any back pain for "kidney" disease. Common people often think that pain in the lower back is caused by kidney disease. In fact, the kidneys are in the upper part of the waist, not the lower part. Kidney problems are certainly a cause of back pain, but not all back pain is caused by kidney disease. There are several types of kidney disease that cause back pain, such as kidney stones and kidney tuberculosis, which cannot be resolved with pills. Even common nephritis is not as simple to treat as advertised.</p>
<p>Secondly, people who are particularly obese should reduce the burden on their waist. People with legs of unequal length should wear shoes with different heel heights to balance the waist.</p>
<p>Acute Epididymitis</p>
<p>People with gonorrhea often develop epididymitis, the cause of which is that gonococci reach the epididymis through the vas deferens from the urethra, causing acute inflammation. At the same time, the testicles are also swollen. Acute epididymitis and orchitis are very painful conditions. If some basic principles are understood, epididymitis can be prevented, and the pain of epididymitis and orchitis can be reduced. Preventing this disease is not</p>
<p>Preventing this disease is not particularly difficult; it can be done as long as the pathology is understood. First, people with gonorrhea must use medication to wash the urethra or perform any kind of surgery gently. Second, do not injure the testicles. Third, people with gonorrhea, even if the testicles have no problems, must always wear a scrotal support (or elastic support). Although this cannot absolutely prevent epididymitis and orchitis, it can prevent eight or nine out of ten cases.</p>
<p>To stop the pain of acute epididymitis and orchitis, the most important thing is not narcotics or pain relievers. The most important things are: (1) Bed rest. (2) Lift up the swollen and painful scrotum, preferably so that it cannot move at all; a support made of adhesive tape is best. (3) Local heat or cold can reduce pain (cold is better than heat). Analgesic paste also has some benefit. (4) Taking or injecting painkillers once to several times is also very reasonable.</p>
<p>Heart Pain</p>
<p>Before we talk about heart pain, let's first talk about the location of the heart. If we don't know where the heart is, we can't easily know what heart pain is. As the saying goes, "Put your conscience in the middle." Speaking of which, the conscience should be in the middle, but the heart is not in the middle of the chest. The location of the heart is: in front of the chest, reaching the third costal cartilage, i.e., the second intercostal space below. Below it reaches the middle seventh costal cartilage, and left and right it reaches the fifth intercostal space. The lower part of the heart on the left side is about three and a half inches from the midline, one and a half inches inside the left nipple. The right side is about two inches from the midline, so the position of the heart is in the middle of the chest, slightly to the left, and not in the very center.</p>
<p>Knowing the position of the heart makes it easier to know whether the pain is heart pain when there is heart pain. Heart pain is treated for heart pain, and the results are good. If it is not heart pain and is treated as heart pain, there will certainly be no good results.</p>
<p>To understand heart pain, you must also understand the structure and pathology of the heart. Here is a brief description: The outside of the heart has two layers of double-folded thin membrane that completely enclose the heart; this membrane is called the pericardium. The envelope is sometimes inflamed and is called pericarditis. This kind of heart pain is often in the chest in front of the heart. The pain is sometimes like a knife stabbing, sometimes dull. Sometimes this pain also reflects to the abdomen. Do not mistake it for abdominal disease.</p>
<p>Since the pericardium is double-layered, sometimes pericarditis produces fluid between these two layers, making the patient feel chest tightness and pain. To stop this pain, this liquid must be extracted and rested.</p>
<p>Inside the pericardium is the heart muscle. Inflammation of the heart muscle is called myocarditis. Myocarditis often has heart pain. Chronic myocarditis is often chronic pain. This pain often starts when exerting force or when the heart is stimulated. The pain is in the upper part of the sternum, or in the upper part of the left chest, or in the chest in front of the heart, or reflects to the left shoulder, left arm, left hand, or the corner of the left lower jaw. Rarely does it reflect to the right side of the body. Myocarditis pain can be mild or severe; mild pain is just a feeling of chest tightness, while severe pain is unbearable, as if the heart is being squeezed in a blacksmith's screw clamp and twisted tight. At the same time, the chest feels constricted, and there is a sense of impending death. The pain often occurs after meals, probably because after meals, more blood gathers in the stomach and intestines, and the heart muscle feels anemic. Patients rarely experience pain at rest or during sleep, except in the late stages of myocarditis. In mild cases, there are often several months of no recurrence after recovery, while in severe cases, the number of pains is more frequent, and the periods without pain are less frequent. When the pain comes, the patient must immediately stop moving, and the pain usually passes within a few minutes. Sometimes the pain reaches its peak, and the patient dies immediately. Some die after the heart has been in pain for a long time and is exhausted.</p>
<p>To stop this kind of heart pain, inhaling amyl nitrite when the pain comes can immediately stop the pain. But the fundamental treatment still requires removing the root cause and resting. Remove the root cause, for example, radically treating rheumatic pain, local root causes, syphilis (tertiary syphilis), high blood pressure, nephritis, and other diseases.</p>

<p>— Hu Jiayan</p>
<p>Chapter 10 The Prognosis of Pulmonary Tuberculosis</p>
<p>The patient's age is also very related to the prognosis. Infants under one or two years old are the most dangerous, and almost all are incurable; however, the number of cases of this disease is actually less than that of adults. Adolescents who have just passed puberty (over sixteen years old) are also particularly dangerous. From then until about thirty years old, they are all within the scope of the danger period. From thirty-five to over fifty years old, most of this disease is chronic, and the prognosis is relatively good. But above fifty-four or five years old, due to the consumption of physical strength, this disease becomes malignant again, and the result often endangers life, which is called senile tuberculosis. In those over three years old and under puberty, the prognosis of this disease is generally better.</p>
<p>The patient's personality is also different from person to person, each with its own characteristics; the result will also affect the disease itself. Some people are extremely sensitive; they have always held a terrifying attitude towards this disease; they do not know that the severity of this disease varies greatly. For example, the early infiltration type can mostly be cured if treated properly; but because the patient is too timid and nervous, the impact on the future is great. Some people have a very strong will, and everywhere they hold the attitude that man will conquer nature, thinking that there is nothing to worry about. But in serious times, like high fever, they should absolutely rest, and cavities should be specially treated, etc., he will sometimes turn a deaf ear; the result will inevitably become worse!</p>
<p>Whether the patient's treatment plan is appropriate? And whether long-term recuperation is carried out? There is a big difference in the situation for the prognosis. We can boldly say that the sooner the proper treatment, the greater the hope for the future. As for the suitability of living in a place for health, the appropriateness of nutrition, and the patient's environment, etc.: all have a great relationship with the patient's future, and must not be regarded as a mere formality.</p>
<p>Finally, the patient's economic situation has absolute authority over the patient's future. Many cases of this disease are not extremely bad at first, but abandoning work and long-term treatment are actually impossible for the patient; the result is that they become worse day by day, leading to incurable; this kind of example is probably countless. But this is the problem of the entire country and society, and of course it cannot be individually undertaken by practicing physicians and private hospitals! (End of this chapter)</p>

<p>(44) Tinnitus</p>
<p>Our ear organs. When there are sound wave vibrations from the outside world. They can immediately generate hearing through the sound-receiving function. If there are no sound wave vibrations from the outside world. Then hearing will not occur, which is a natural principle. But sometimes. There are no sound wave vibrations from the outside world. One can indeed hear a kind of sound oneself. This is what is called tinnitus. People in general believe that tinnitus is a sign of physical weakness and qi deficiency. This kind of explanation. Is rather vague. If we speak clearly from the perspective of otology. Tinnitus is actually a kind of auditory sensation that comes from abnormal excitation of the auditory nerve. This auditory sensation is only felt by oneself. Others do not feel it. Therefore, tinnitus is also called subjective hearing. Tinnitus often occurs with diseases of the auditory organs. For example, in acute catarrhal otitis media, chronic catarrhal otitis media, acute suppurative otitis media, chronic suppurative otitis media, otosclerosis, labyrinthine anemia, labyrinthine hyperemia, various poisonings, and inner ear inflammation, etc. Tinnitus is often a necessary symptom. The pitch, type, strength, duration, and pain of tinnitus are all different. Now I will briefly describe them as follows.</p>
<p>(1) Pitch of tinnitus The pitch of tinnitus is ever-changing. There are low, high, harmonious, disharmonious, clear, and mixed sounds, etc.</p>
<p>(2) Types of tinnitus The sound characteristics of tinnitus can often be distinguished as buzzing, cicada chirping, insect chirping, wind sound, bell sound, flute sound, water bubble sound, boiling water sound, wave sound, and ringing, etc.</p>
<p>(3) Strength of tinnitus When in a happy mood, refreshed, sunny weather, moderate labor, and normal menstruation, etc. The degree of tinnitus is often weak. When angry, upset, in a bad mood, mentally exhausted, in changing weather, overworked, abnormal menstruation, reproductive organ disorders, and pregnancy, etc. The degree of tinnitus is often strong.</p>
<p>(4) Duration of tinnitus There are three types of tinnitus duration. Namely, paroxysmal, intermittent, and continuous. Among them, continuous tinnitus has a relatively poor prognosis.</p>
<p>(5) Pain of tinnitus The pain of tinnitus. First, it hinders hearing. Second, it easily causes annoyance. Third, it is mistaken for sound. When the degree of tinnitus is severe. It can often prevent people from engaging in work. Or hinder sleep. Or even be unable to endure the pain and commit suicide.</p>

<h3 id="e205">Firecrackers or Bombs? <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>— Long</p>
<p>A Reuters dispatch from London on the 20th stated that Germany's letter of protest against the League of Nations resolution has been simultaneously submitted to the fourteen countries of the League of Nations Council. Its wording is far from what foreign sources predicted. Government officials said, "This is not a bomb, but a firecracker." The explosive power of firecrackers and bombs naturally has a difference as vast as the sky and the earth. Is Germany's letter of protest really a firecracker or a bomb? It is worth discussing.</p>
<p>In everything, onlookers are clear, and those involved are confused. Those involved exhaust their scheming, engage in infighting, and do their best to manipulate and operate. However, onlookers consider it unworthy of a smile. The League of Nations resolution, in the eyes of the League of Nations, is naturally a huge bomb thrown at Germany. However, in the eyes of the Germans, it is nothing more than a firecracker. Although we have not seen the original text of Germany's letter of protest, judging from the London dispatch, the content of the note is a straightforward letter of protest against the League of Nations resolution. Although its wording is strong, it is restrained. Judging from these few words, it is enough to see that Germany's letter of protest is actually a bomb, not comparable to the firecrackers set off at temple fairs.</p>
<p>In Germany's opinion, you fourteen countries can pass resolutions as you please, but we Germany will never recognize them. See what else you can do? There is no need to say more. In this way, the League of Nations resolution is equivalent to waste paper, and the seriousness of its letter of protest can be generally seen. However, the British are calm and wave their feather fans lightly, saying: "This is a firecracker, not a bomb." There are originally unavoidable difficulties in it. The British attitude towards Germany's situation is different from that of France and Italy. On the one hand, Britain is a member of the League of Nations, and on the other hand, it is willing to be a mediator and does not want to join the vortex. Once the meeting starts, it cannot stay out of it and has to support the resolution (Britain is also one of the signatory countries of Versailles). In this way, Britain really has a difficult situation of pleasing both sides. Britain really has unspeakable pain, and the reason is here.</p>
<p>Therefore, although Germany firmly opposes the League of Nations resolution, Britain can only deal with it with a calm attitude and cannot help but say a few sarcastic remarks. On the one hand, as a country of the League of Nations resolution, if it overemphasizes Germany's protest, not only will its own face not look good, but it will also not be able to turn around. On the other hand, Britain is willing to be a mediator and does not want both parties to break down. If there is an opportunity for mediation, the British are still willing to come out to mediate. Therefore, in any tense atmosphere, they must say something to ease it. This is in the British psyche, they cannot but harbor such a wish, as a basis for changing course later.</p>
<p>But turning back to look at Germany's attitude, what is it like? A dispatch from Berlin on the 20th stated that for Hitler's birthday, troops were reviewed and power was displayed. At the same time, the letter of protest against the League of Nations was announced, and the important significance of the government's decision to reorganize its armed forces was reiterated. Broadcasting to various countries, the civil servants' union contributed one million marks to present to the leader, as the corner of the German people's physical training. Judging from this point, is Germany's letter of protest really a firecracker? Or a bomb? What exactly is it?</p>
<h3 id="e206">Spring Cold <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>— Yafei</p>
<p>Since the beginning of spring this year, there have not been many clear days, but there has also been very little rain. The peach blossom water in March did not flow down as people imagined. However, the overcast sky all day long, without seeing a few full suns, is indeed the reality.</p>
<p>"Ah! God is simply going to take the lives of poor people. Last year, it was so dry and satisfying for a year, but this year it is such a face again. The weather is overcast, and even the weather in April is not so cold. It is said that the spring harvest will be greatly discounted, and I am afraid that the flowers and fruits on the trees and the future paddy fields will also be affected by it!"</p>
<p>Recently, Little Tiger Cai Shun often sighed, cursing the sky to himself, resenting the sky, and complaining that God was deliberately going against him. In fact, he didn't know that every farmer was not in the same fate as him, struggling under the oppression of famine and terror! After eating today, I don't know where tomorrow will be. After tomorrow, I don't know how the day after tomorrow will go on? Sometimes, perhaps, even today cannot be survived. Such a miserable situation can be easily seen at any time and anywhere in every rural area today.</p>
<p>Little Tiger Cai Shun's family has eleven mouths to feed, and only he and his eldest son, A Gen, can work. In previous years, in addition to farming, they also had a sideline—tying paper houses—冥屋 (miniature paper house burned at funerals), which earned at most about two hundred yuan a year. But now, where would there be any spare money to transcend ancestors and burn paper houses?</p>
<p>For three years, he has not been able to harvest flowers and fruits, and the fields have been planted in vain, and no one has asked him to tie paper houses anymore. Thus, his entire source of life has been completely dried up!</p>
<p>A few loads of grain were harvested the year before last. After paying off the grain and rent, there was only a limited amount left. They drank bean porridge for every meal, barely making it to last spring before it was gone. Last year, the fields were cracked from the drought, and the newly transplanted seedlings all withered and died. There has been no income for a full year until now: living by pawning, selling, and borrowing. Now, everything that can be pawned has been pawned, all the borrowing has been exhausted, and even if there is something to buy, no one wants it. This kind of life is really suffering for Little Tiger Cai Shun! Last year, he often comforted himself, thinking: "After a great famine, there will be a great harvest!" So he fully expected this year to be a year of great harvest, which could compensate for last year's poor harvest, and perhaps some of the borrowed money could be paid back, and some of the pawned items could be redeemed. Unexpectedly, the first shot of this year's spring harvest shattered his dream. The autumn harvest is still a very slim hope!</p>
<p>Because Little Tiger Cai Shun had too many mouths to feed, he managed to entrust someone to recommend his fourteen-year-old second son to a preserved goods store to work as an apprentice, and hastily married his seventeen-year-old daughter to her fiancé's family, while sending his twelve-year-old youngest daughter to a small fishing boat to be a child bride. In this way, three mouths were reduced on his shoulders. However, there are still eight people to feed, and eight people are not easy to deal with after all! Therefore, he often felt that he was in danger of being swallowed:</p>
<p>"Alas! The harvest is so poor, and there are so many mouths to feed. One day I will be swallowed by them, alas! One day..."</p>
<p>"Spring cold freezes old yellow cattle!" Besides worrying and cursing about the gray sky every day, what else can he do?</p>
<h3 id="e207">The Birth of a Home <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>— Cheng Quan</p>
<p>We two have already reached the borderline of middle age, and we both understand: we are no longer children who can enter paradise, nor are we suited to regard the friendship and love between boys and girls built on the foundation of real life as a poetic game to admire and yearn for; as older adults, why are we always lingering on the fringes of life without settling down? Moreover, this is not a one-time or two-time thing: some acquaintances all look at us with puzzled thoughts: "You're not wanderers, you should have a home." Indeed, what they say is absolutely right, even we ourselves have thought that way long ago: we should have a home! Isn't it so? Even ants have their own lovely little nests, why should people be born into wandering and then have to endlessly continue this frightening eternal wandering? — This is not an easy life.</p>
<p>It is a fact; we two are gradually leaving the joyful paradise of youth, and on the other hand, we experience a slight sense of emptiness from the perspective of middle age: understanding that this is the time to face life with a serious face, we feel afraid and lonely; then we think that two people who have come through rosy love affairs must begin to squeeze together; that is to say, we must have our own little nest.</p>
<p>Both of us have that kind of feeling and need, so we think: even if our strength is as weak as ants, ants are also very brave in using their own labor to build their own small shelter. So, we took two still childish hearts, and with the patience and labor of ants, fearless, without worry, and without shrinking back, we began to choose "to use our own labor to create a lovely little home" as the goal of our lives in this lonely and desolate world, and walked the same path that everyone must go through from childhood to middle age.</p>
<p>Perhaps the thing called "home" is somewhat frightening? Yes, no one can deny this. However, life itself is just a kind of temptation, a kind of longing. When the charming shadow of a comfortable home begins to shine incessantly on the borderline of middle age, people forget everything, people desperately go for her, get her, forgetting the danger, and forgetting the fear!</p>
<p>Similarly, for the sake of home, for the sake of our own home, we have to start a period of frightening labor, we two need strength in the treacherous waves of life; first of all, for the difficult material foundation, we have to desperately increase our respective labor, even voluntarily increasing work to more than twelve hours a day.</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>We have also worked hard to endure unspeakable long periods of separation, but these were all endured with the greatest possible patience, and what followed were the stumbling blocks of the old social system, so, in order to remove, resist, and crush them, strength and courage became necessary again. We two were weak in our youth; but even if we are weak, what does it matter? People walk along their own path, work, and sweat, so, we gradually won the possibility of being together, had a place to live, had furniture that increased from one piece to two pieces, had a kind of mood suitable for two young people to work together, and had a home.</p>
<p>A home was born! But a kind of uncomfortable terror that starts from life's actions was also born. The days are endlessly long, but life is endlessly vague; yet, we are "people with a home" now.</p>
<p>Like a dying snail wandering at the foot of the wall: carrying its shell, I begin to feel its weight, and I am afraid.</p>
<h3 id="e208">Fishing Season <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>— Shi Feng</p>
<p>The residents of Wengjiazhai live by fishing. Every spring and autumn are the seasons when fish are most abundant. Wengjia Pond is an official river. As long as one does not encroach on anyone's dam (although the dams are also privately built), no one dares to interfere with net fishing on one's own fish dam all day long. But the dozens of fishermen there are all law-abiding, and they entrust their lives to this pond. When it is the spawning season, no one is seen casting nets to fish on each dam. The propagation of fish is like farmers' hope for their rice and wheat, and they dare not destroy their lives. Therefore, during the two fishing seasons, every fisherman smiles and catches buckets of fish to sell in the town. Those small fish and miscellaneous shrimp are used as wine dishes every night, and everyone lives in peace, as if their lives are only for fishing.</p>
<p>When the peach blossoms are in full bloom, it is again the fishing season for Wengjiazhai. A'gen, a robust man, does not have a wife. There is a mother and a younger sister at home. Today, when he carries his fishing gear out of the house, he tells his eleven-year-old sister: "Don't go out to play randomly. Don't let the wild cats steal the two fish in the wooden bucket!" Singing a song, facing the rising sun, he strides towards the dam. Walking through two mud banks, Jin San comes running towards him, shouting:</p>
<p>"A grave is going to be built on the upper reaches of the Wengjia River. That damned river surface dam has extended by more than ten feet, isn't that going to kill us!" Jin San's face is flushed, and the beads of sweat on his forehead hang down from the corners of his eyebrows on both sides, circling on his red face like two earthworms. Seeing A'gen, it is as if he is a mortal enemy, and he is eager to fight.</p>
<p>"Really building a grave?" A'gen also jumped up. He knew last winter that Jin, the master in town, was going to bury his late grandfather. Yin-yang master Wu Sanguan took his compass every day to examine the left and right sides of the Wengjia Pond. He said that the upper river was a dragon's pool and a tiger's den. If a grave was built there, the descendants would surely prosper. Now they really want to make fengshui on the river surface.</p>
<p>"That murderer! He only knows how to flatter. Why doesn't he recognize Master Jin as his father and come to us for food all the time!"</p>
<p>"Don't talk about that rascal! He has long wanted to dominate the pond!"</p>
<p>"Want us to have no food to eat? He'll have to lose his life first! Let's go to the dam and tell everyone."</p>
<p>Several law-abiding fishermen are already setting up their nets on the dam. Seeing Jin San and A'gen coming, everyone greets them.</p>
<p>"Everyone listen..." Jin San jumps on his own dam like a monkey, "Master Jin is going to build a grave, do you know?..."</p>
<p>Brother Er is the clown of Wengjiazhai. He makes jokes, and when there is something serious, he sneaks away like a ghost. Today, he was the first to arrive at the dam, and he just boasted that he had caught a big fish weighing more than three pounds. Hearing Jin San's speech, he lets out his unique laughter that makes people laugh and shouts to the other side of the river;</p>
<p>"Listen: That dog is inviting our Master Jin to drink a cup of wine!"</p>
<p>Sure enough, laughter like thunder roars from both banks, and some are even applauding.</p>
<p>"Drinking bird wine? We're going to run out of food!" Jin San shouts in an even louder voice: "That murderer is building a grave on the river surface, the river surface dam is ten feet wide, everyone go to the upper river to take a look..." Jin San seems to be going crazy, jumping on the dam, his eyes wide, as if about to burst out of their sockets, staring at Brother Er on the other side of the river.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that Wu Sanguan came to the Wengjia River. Everyone also knows that he called it a dragon's pool and a tiger's den. Brother Er glances at the upper river, where there is a row of wooden stakes straight in the center of the river. He avoids Jin San's line of sight and goes to play with his big fish weighing more than three pounds.</p>
<p>The river is quiet at this time. Only Jin San's voice echoes wildly. Everyone grinds their teeth in hatred. Their hearts are all flying home. They have old mothers, wives, weak younger sisters, and sons. The mouths of the whole family are all facing this pond; now burying the dead on the river is blocking the mouths of the living...</p>
<p>"This... this is an official river..." Several people shout.</p>
<p>"This is an official river! We'll go to the county government to speak out. The magistrate will always be fair!"</p>
<p>"Everyone go together!" Jin San seems to be the leader, ordering.</p>
<p>"We'll all go together!" The voice of the crowd.</p>
<h3 id="e209">Dreams and Reality <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>— Simon</p>
<p>Only dreams can detach us from the coarse and troubled web of life, only dreams can give a comfortable solace to those who dislike the tumultuous affairs of the world. If there is no nourishment of dreams, I think life will appear abnormally dry, or reduce a lot of interest. And it is like a boundless vast desert, full of flying dust and yellow earth obscuring the sky, dreams, it seems, are a very rare oasis in the desert, perhaps a pool of clear water, perhaps a green grass, or perhaps a green house in the distant distance, making the traveler on a long journey find a nest of water to wet his throat in the midst of extreme fatigue, or have a slightly restful place, so as not to become an endless eternal hardship. Although that green house of final rest is still far away, the expectation is naturally brewing, and therefore the heavy steps will unknowingly speed up. Reality is ultimately monotonous and ugly, what is confusing to your eyes is a bleak and terrible picture, on which there are mutual struggles of fighting and shouting, there are the sad groans of being trampled on, there are ferocious faces, there is blood, there are tears, and you yourself are one of the various roles in it. Whoever sees who slips once in a thousand times of attention, they will hit you with a stick, people are aiming so accurately, and you are also aiming so accurately, in daily life everyone hides their true image, and instead pretends to have perhaps a hard or perhaps a weak face to compete and attack the people around them, because life—that is, reality—is a struggle, a tense journey, you can't let go for a moment, and let others step on him. On this treacherous reality—the journey of life, can you take a breath, turn over, and smile?</p>
<p>However, people have to be the agent of life—a prisoner of reality, and the reality of life is simply equal to a cage, a chain, tightly and firmly binding you, restricting you from escaping, all are useless delusions. However, this cage, this chain is invisible, but you know that you can't completely walk out of its circle. If you don't believe it, think about it, how is it that you are always tirelessly running around from morning to night, all year round, grinding, and gradually your hair turns white, your eyes become dim, and you are getting old. Isn't it the result of suffering all kinds of torture in life? So you don't deny at all that the source of the troubles of real life is the abyss of pain, feeling absolute despair, and boredom, like a desert is really too dry. Fortunately, there are dreams, just like there is clear water, green grass, and green houses in the desert, so you will not become an eternally desperate traveler, dreams are beautiful, warm, like a delicate woman with a fragrance all over her body, taking advantage of the period when you temporarily separate from reality—always when your eyes are closed. She smiles and lightly comes to visit you, so you are dizzy and call her to lead you into a splendid, intoxicating paradise, because of her tender comfort and gentle consideration, you can't help but forget all the pain of entanglement in reality, in the dream, you are happy, happy, because you will see the people or things you usually see, and get all kinds of valuable things that you usually can't get, dreams will give you as much as possible without stinginess. And in the dream, you see the real self.</p>
<p>Although it will not heal the sores of reality, but with her comfort, you can get some spiritual relief, temporarily cross the shackles of that painful and troubled web of reality. At the same time, with a degree of injection of dreams, your heart, which is extremely disgusted with reality, will once again support you, like a long-distance traveler expecting the arrival of the distant green house.</p>

<p>— Zhi</p>
<p>Old friend, I haven't seen your writing for a long time, I always thought that you have changed a little, but, I am really gratified, you are still singing your inherent tune. This is what I have always been most impressed with since we met, can you still forget the preface you wrote for me? Over the years, the children who mixed together in childhood have gone their separate ways, the hardships of the world have left absolutely different scars on each of us, but the blood when injured is the same red for everyone, now you can say that the journey has come to an end, and you are resting a little, and I am more and more the opposite of you. I certainly cannot judge whether my current situation is good or bad, but, hearing you sing your inherent unchanging tune from afar, I think privately: should you change your voice?</p>
<p>How can I forget the extravagant travels in Zhenjiang? As for thinking about my unemployment from that time, I don't feel any special sorrow, but, when I occasionally think of a few people who treat friends with a merchant's attitude, I can't help but feel extremely cold. Haven't I seen through the impoverished life of the past two years? It's just a casual mention today.</p>
<p>It is true that I am reading books behind closed doors; it is also true that I am unwilling to be bound by books, in a word, I am indeed "reading books behind closed doors". My reading is neither for the sake of "there are golden houses in books", nor for the old saying "opening a book is beneficial", but for the sake of my wanting to take off the long gown and wear "short clothes" and find a guide. I remember that you wrote an article on "abandoning literature for martial arts" (I certainly can't remember what was said inside), and you expounded on the uselessness of "literature", then you should understand my reading.</p>
<p>We haven't met for a long time, perhaps because I am "reading books behind closed doors"? I have also heard a little about the affairs of your family this time. What else can be said about this? But thinking of my own affairs, I think it is more painful than yours. Let's not talk about it, these old words, let us see what this year's spring is like. Is it necessary to say more? This year's spring is rainy.</p>
<p>You may not believe it, I spent thirty cents last night to see a Chinese-produced sound film, and I was very satisfied to watch it from beginning to end. You will think that I am a low-level enthusiast, and at the same time you will definitely be able to think of the leisurely low-level enthusiast. This, if I said this five years ago, what do you think now? You will definitely be able to answer me that it is "a thought from five years ago."</p>
<p>Let's not mention things from five years ago, or even things from the most current second ago! Come, let us compare what the next five years from today will change to, and answer accordingly.</p>

<p>Opening Piece "Ode to Seeing Off Spring"</p>
<p>An inch of time is worth an inch of gold. An inch of gold cannot buy an inch of time. Time easily passes with spring. As spring leaves, fallen flowers fill the courtyard. Fallen flowers fill the courtyard, flowers do not speak. Courtyard flowers do not speak, locking in the city of sorrow. The city of sorrow surrounds spring without laziness. Without laziness, spring wind carries catkins and dust. Wind and catkins carry dust, lightly unpolluted. Dust lightly unpolluted, grass is green. Green willows hang by the riverbank. Willow thousands of strands dance like catkins. Dancing catkins lightly drift thousands of miles. Drifting thousands of miles to short and long pavilions. Long pavilion to see off spring in the third month. The third month of spring returns, dreams do not form. Dreams do not form, sleep is lazy with spring. Eyes are lazy with spring, accompanied by waning lamps. Waning lamps in a lonely spring boudoir of resentment. Boudoir resentment yellow orioles seem to be telling their feelings. Like telling their feelings, intestines are about to break. Sadness to the point of breaking, a pitiful person. Pitiful people grow old with the spring. Growing old with the spring, fearing to hear the singing of orioles. Fearing to hear the singing of orioles, tear stains wet sleeves at midnight. Midnight listening to two lonely lamps, sipping wine to see off spring under the lamps. Sipping wine to see off spring with a song. A song of spring, emotions of parting. Emotions of parting, the Yangguan willow. Willows dark, flowers bright, another village. When the village birds sing, the southern shore is green. Green waves of spring water rise on the stream banks. Stream banks water rises, reflecting green moss. Moss reflects the remnants of spring, the valley entrance is deep. Deep courtyard butterflies fly, flowers fill the ground. Flying flowers fill the ground, no one sweeps. No one can earn a long spring to stay. Spring stays in Jiangnan, far away to see off. Seeing off writing a song to see off spring.</p>

<h3 id="e214">The Deep Dark Secrets of Hollywood: Auditioning Actors (Part 2) <a href="#e214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>— Fu</p>
<p>What has been said above pertains to the dark secrets of stage auditions. In Hollywood, there exists a type of actor's agent, essentially a high-class referral service, specializing in connecting actors with various companies. Once a contract is established, they take ten percent of the actor's salary as commission. Of course, for a major star earning three to four thousand dollars a week, the agent pockets three to four hundred dollars in commission weekly, which is quite considerable. But what about the smaller actors? You might think the agent has nothing to gain. But they have their methods. They tell you, secretly: "A certain company is looking for someone through a certain agent, and he doesn't have anyone. I'll recommend you. But... that agent also wants a ten percent commission." You agree, because you're desperate to find a position.</p>
<p>In the end, that "certain agent" situation never existed, but your agent securely pockets twenty percent commission. Sometimes, the so-called "certain agents" number three or more. Your salary is only twenty-five dollars a day, and after paying three or four ten percent commissions, you're only left with enough for transportation. But the enduring hope, that one day you might get a longer engagement, always makes you reluctantly accept, even though you are somewhat aware of the darkness behind it all.</p>
<p>Besides this, there are the dark secrets of the fly-by-night film companies. Once, a small company advertised for student-type actors, to shoot some short films of school life. Someone named Jia went to audition, because he knew he was very knowledgeable about school life and a strong athlete. He arrived there and saw that the so-called company's premises were only temporary, and the director of rehearsals was not difficult to meet. Indeed, he told him that he was exactly the talent they needed. He asked him to send some photos to look at. Of course, he happily agreed.</p>
<p>The next day, he sent the photos. The director looked at them and said, not bad... but... oh, he was too enthusiastic, he absolutely had to help him and make this happen... but it would be best to take a few more photos. Coincidentally, there was a photographer there with deep experience in film, who would certainly know how to take lively and energetic photos. The price wasn't high, only eight dollars a dozen, because that was just the photographer's extra income. Jia thought it wasn't a bad idea, that photos sent to the company must be lively and energetic. Why should he save a little tip and give up a good opportunity? So he made an appointment with the director to take photos the next evening.</p>
<p>When he arrived the next evening, he saw many people dressed as male and female students, like a sophomore dance party. The photographer calculated that there were seventy or eighty people, each paying eight dollars, and the income would be considerable. With a sudden idea, he shrank back, deciding to come back when the senior class had a dance party. Sure enough, one day he met a "female student" he had seen that day. He asked her how it went. It turned out she spent eight dollars and got a dozen small promotional photos. The movie was never made, because the "company closed down."</p>
<p>Radio broadcasting is also a good way to enter the film world, and of course it also has its dark secrets. It is said that a new radio station was about to be established and was recruiting new talent. Jia went again and met a playwriting director. He was extremely polite. He didn't say anything like he was exactly who they were looking for. What he said was, "I can tell genius at a glance. You are one!" He told him that he had already agreed with several large companies, and as long as the program rehearsals were complete, they could sign long-term contracts. But, he had excellent scripts and excellent programs, and there was no problem with the contract, but he had to do three days of auditions first. But... (listen!) In the rehearsals, the director was a person of status, so he had to collect a little subsidy. It wasn't much, only two dollars and fifty cents for each audition. Of course, he wasn't the only one auditioning, but the director told him that others were just trying out, but the contract was exclusively his. He understood in his heart, and immediately excused himself and left.</p>
<p>A few weeks later, he inquired, and the auditions were indeed happening, but whether anyone was listening was a question, because the audition was just like playing a few gramophone records to fill the gaps. He took out a pencil and calculated, thirty people, rehearsing twice a week, charging two dollars and fifty cents each time, (for five weeks, the total would be seven hundred and fifty dollars. Not much, but not bad.</p>
<p>There are really many dark secrets. Varied and numerous, they cannot be generalized. Some use photos to swindle money, others use sound recordings on records to swindle money. When they recruit radio singers, they first ask each person to make a recording for the company to choose. Often someone spends five silver dollars to buy a record worth twenty-five cents. As for finding a job, it's just a wasted trip.</p>
<p>These dark secrets, like Nian Nu in "Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio," are full of tricks and impossible to guard against. Fortunately, clever people are always careful. (The End)</p>

<h3 id="e215">Review of "Flying Generals" <a href="#e215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>— You Jing</p>
<p>“Devil Dogs of the Air”</p>
<p>——Great China Theater</p>
<p>After watching "Flying Generals," one can't help but think of the recently released "Here Comes the Navy." Not only are the main actors in these two films the same, but the script content, presentation style, and production attitude are also completely consistent.</p>
<p>In this era of economic panic and political crisis, suffocating most countries and forcing them to seek unknowable exits in war, the urgency of a second world war has become an undeniable fact. As a result, some playwrights who face reality, feeling the horror of war and caressing the wounds of the first world war, loudly shout out the warning signs of the dangers of war, producing many films that are close to anti-war. Due to differences in the authors' understanding and knowledge, and the profit-driven minds of film enterprises, the works we have seen are either humanistic, passively cursing and exposing the evils of war, or unprincipledly opposing all wars of different natures. Therefore, they only become things that are close to anti-war; but at the same time, there is a group of playwrights who are the mouthpieces of war-makers, the supporters of militarism and militaristic thought, and sing a synchronized quick march to the proposals and actions of expanding armaments and increasing military spending.</p>
<p>From "Here Comes the Navy" to "Flying Generals," is a clear example of this trend. The former boasted of the power of the great navy flying the "Stars and Stripes," and here there is another demonstration of huge aircraft carriers and swarms of planes.</p>
<p>As for the script of the film "Flying Generals," which conveys this mission, it is clearly poor.</p>
<p>Amid the deafening sound of engines and the dazzling shadows of planes, the author presents a rude, wild, frivolous, and arrogant young man named Tom as a hero, making him a sermon for conceit and belligerence. He said that Tom, through the introduction of his neighbor, current military officer Bill Lanigan, entered military training. Because of his improper showboating in flight, he was scolded by his superiors and flew away in his plane. The author forced him to have a problem on the way and land in front of Petty’s coffee shop, giving him the opportunity to brag to the woman, and naturally developed the fictitious plot into romance. Naturally, male and female romances are more interesting as triangles, so first attribute the love of this girl, Quinty, to Bill Lanigan. In this way, using the relationship between superior and subordinate to compete for love, naturally there will be more disputes. He also wrote that Bill Lanigan wanted to inspect Tom's skills, and they rode in the same plane. Then, in the accidental opportunity of the fuselage suddenly catching fire in the air, he wrote that Bill Lanigan jumped with a parachute because he was afraid of death, while Tom landed safely. This artificiality was used to suppress Bill Lanigan and reveal Tom. Then read about them embarrassing each other in Petty's store.</p>
<p>Tom, who suffered a loss in love to his superior, naturally had to work hard in his position, so Tom was finally promoted to adjutant. The main show of the naval exercise and the air force's great mobilization officially opened at this time. Long shots served as a multifaceted performance of the navy and air force, showing off impact, cover, attack, and smoke screens, doing everything possible to demonstrate total power, and then returning to the heroic feats of individual heroes. Tom's wing was broken and he was in danger. At that time, Bill Lanigan was sitting with him again. This time, it was Bill's chance to shine, risking danger to save Tom. It is said that the proud and frivolous Tom was also conquered from then on. So, Bill gave Petty to this young and talented air force hero as a reward, and he was promoted again. Tom and Petty, hero and beauty, were reunited in triumph and good fortune.</p>
<p>Aside from the fictitious story, the far-fetched plot, and the display of the "Stars and Stripes" military power, there seems to be nothing else. If there is anything, it is only the technique of photography.</p>
<p>The director (Lloyd Bacon) also failed to portray the characters' personalities well. Besides writing about Tom's boasting while his companions pretend to sleep, and his manicuring his nails when the officer is instructing him, and his dozing off while planning a battle in a model exercise, the only characteristic is his loud laughter. As for writing about Tom repeatedly wooing Petty and taking pride in being slapped, it was originally the nature of the general foolish sailors. The personality of Petty is even more vague and contradictory. From the time she met Bill Lanigan to his departure, she never showed any love for him, but in the end she suddenly had to make her throw herself into Tom's silly embrace. This process is too lacking.</p>
<p>Most of the actors are from the original cast of "Here Comes the Navy." Their acting skills, other than flying techniques, are extremely limited, so there is no need to say more.</p>
<h3 id="e216">"After Midnight" Is a Sketch of New York Nightlife <a href="#e216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>

<p>Silver screen heartthrob Clark Gable previously starred with Joan Crawford and Robert Montgomery in "Forsaking All Others." He can deeply perform the active spirit of modern youth to the point of mythologization. But this first collaboration with Constance Bennett in "After Midnight" is also a brand new 1935 romance. Movie fans already know about Constance Bennett's allure. But don't forget that Connie is one of the six movie stars in the world who is most fashionable and elegantly dressed. At the same time, Clark Gable, due to his performance with Claudette Colbert, the star of "It Happened One Night," both won the Academy Award for Best Actor and Actress in 1934.</p>
<p>"After Midnight" was originally Mankiewicz's work. Mankiewicz has served in the press for many years, of course his observations and experiences of New York nightlife are very deep and abundant. Especially regarding the secrets of the East River yacht nightclub Nirety Yacht Club, there are faithful sketches, not to mention the thrilling plots of love disputes between men and women, and assassination detectives, etc.</p>
<p>The director of the film is Robert Z. Leonard. In addition to Clark playing the editor-in-chief of the newspaper and Connie playing the female reporter, other actors include Beery R．Harworth and Stephen, etc.</p>

<p>— Ti Yun</p>
<p>Tolee said, "Your memory is not bad." Ward said again, "As for the money, you had twenty thousand in your bank a year and a half ago. Now I'm afraid you don't even have ten thousand." Tolee interjected, "The exact amount is only about five hundred. Also, there are many unpaid returned checks." Ward listened, feeling dumbfounded, knowing that it was useless to argue or reason with him. He has been like this since the plane crash five years ago.</p>
<p>That was five years ago, he took his parents and sister to Newport in a plane he piloted himself. He encountered a heavy fog midway, and his parents and young sister died, but he escaped death and is still alive today. Although his body is alive, his soul died with those he loved.</p>
<p>That mess was not his fault... because no one could have foreseen that kind of fog. It rose silently and attacked them, like bandits attacking traveling guests. Tolee flew blindly in the fog for several hours. He watched as the gasoline was running out. His parents also knew his mental anguish. Beads of sweat emerged one by one from his forehead. He gritted his teeth and told them that he could only be forced to stop. His parents and sister did not scream, but the terrible expression on their faces was something he could never erase from his mind, because after Tolee finished speaking, the engine had stopped, the plane was spiraling, and plunging into the bottomless abyss.</p>
<p>That was such a happy thing when they set off. The sky was so clear. They all felt excited, knowing that Tolee's driving skills were flawless. But heaven did not fulfill their wishes, and this tragedy happened.</p>
<p>When he woke up in the hospital, he was no longer the Tolee Pike he used to be. Later, he fully recovered. In terms of his body, he had once been a pilot for the air mail bureau, and gradually became famous for not being afraid of death. He had nerves of steel, and the closer he was to death, the happier he became. Day by day, he took risks that sane drivers would not dare to take. These things were well known to Ward Blythe... since that tragedy happened. But he always hoped that his temperament would slowly forget as the years went by. Now, looking at Tolee's spirit, he was deeply worried.</p>
<p>So Ward asked again, "Then what do you plan to do after the five hundred is used up?" He wanted to use money to touch his realistic ideas. But Tolee shrugged and said, "For someone who lives in the clouds, whether or not they have money, how to spend it, is not a problem." Ward advised him, "You're still like this. It's been five years now, you should think it through."</p>
<p>Tolee thought deeply, as if talking to himself, "I know... I have three cracks on my head... but father, mother, and Cynthia..." He paused, feeling a pang of pain in his heart, and then said, "Why should I live? The three people I loved most in the world are dead, but I am lucky enough to live, am I a greedy person who is afraid of death... In fact, my soul died with them long ago... From then on, I will forever live in the clouds." Ward couldn't say a word for a moment, but he was driving the car while thinking deeply. After a while, he reluctantly said, "Of course I understand your feelings, everyone would be like that. But is this kind of meaningless adventure necessary? Why do you have to be like this?"
