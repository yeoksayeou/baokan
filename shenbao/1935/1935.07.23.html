<h3 id="c26">再論英日關係 <a href="#c26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>— 昻</p>
<p>日前論東亞方面英日之利害衝突。近數日中復有二事。足資參證。（一）日本與偽滿本月十五日在長春簽訂設置共同經濟委員會之協定。以「謀兩國經濟關係之永久强固。實現兩國經濟之合理的融洽。」此為東亞集團運動之又一步驟。（二）孟却斯德商會之紡織業化學工業及機器業於本月十七日向英商部提呈對華貿易報告。確認日本之進取政策及商業競爭情形。使英國近年來在遠東之放任政策有代以積極行動之必要。此為英國方面感受威脅之又一表示。以上兩事針鋒相對。兩國經濟衝突之嚴重性。於此亦可見其一斑。</p>
<p>英日兩國具有若是深刻之矛盾。而外交方面猶虛與委蛇。廣田外交屢以協和二字為標榜。英國新外相霍賽穆則近在表示保持英國遠東利益之外。猶以願與日本提携為言。此兩國間之外交狀態。亦値得一加考慮。請先言霍氏政治思想之本質。當鮑爾溫改組英內閣之初。霍氏以印度事務大臣而繼西門氏為外相。另由艾登氏為不管部閣員。專辦國聯事務。霍氏於英外交界為一新人物。其上台可視為英政府外交政策改弦更張之表徵。尤以在對美對亞方面最為明顯。據吾人觀察。霍氏就任外相後之言行。最足表現英國之新保守主義此種主義。簡言之。卽於國際妥協之中。謀自身利益之積極發展是也。</p>
<p>上月間。日本駐英大使松平離任返國之際。霍氏曾致數語。略謂。「英日關係近來不無糾紛之因素。華北近事可槪其餘。兩大工業國工商業遍天下。時起紛爭。勢所不免。」又云。「吾英以為兩國間正當之諒解與提携。不僅為亞洲安寗之要素。亦為世界繁榮之所繫。」本月中霍氏向下院宣布政策。亦謂</p>
<p>「英政府深信中國安定之得保持。胥賴中日關係之進步以及該兩國與其他利益相共目的相關之各國問之合作。」就此以觀。霍氏對於英日合作。平分秋色。似尙未能忘情。</p>
<p>雖然。自倫敦經濟會議失敗以來。國際合作以謀世界繁榮之企圖。卽成可望而不可卽之幻想。英日之間。自去年印日商約廢止。及西謨拉通商會議破裂後。識者固早謂已無調和之餘地。近頃英政府為其首席經濟顧問黎樂施來華一舉。迭向日本政府徵求合作。而日外務次官重光葵始終表示拒絕。尤證兩國合作。絕不可能。然則兩國外交辭令上之所謂協和所謂提携。豈非僅以掩蓋相互間之敵意乎。</p>

<p>（又黎）法國報紙一致載稱、意阿爭端自最近阿王向國會發表激昻之訓詞後、已入嚴重之階段、小巴黎人報之羅馬專電稱、兩國斷絕外交關係當不在遠、但此後未必卽將宣戰或發生戰鬥行為云、巴黎廻聲報認日本之態度在以有色人種之保護者自居、故堪重視、英國旣在亞菲兩洲擁有廣大之殖民地、决不願拱手讓人、此事發展之結束、意國愈欲增進對法之邦交、蓋法國對於意阿爭執實抱親意態度之唯一國家也、但意國對於法國之中立尙不滿足、現正要求法國作進一步之行動、惟法國自身現在發生困難、苟非愚駘、决不願為新交之意、而犧牲對英之友誼也、衆院外交委員會主席巴斯鐵在共和日報發表一文、稱意國現欲凌駕國際組織而上之、此種態度實際等於否認他國存在或自由决定之權利、故將危害國際秩序之全部槪念云、（二十一日國民電）</p>

<p>（倫敦）據每日電聞報載稱、關於意阿爭端、雖有人主張國聯行政院應設法延緩開會、然倫敦方面則尠加贊成、蓋意阿戰爭、危機已問不容髮、欲圖維持和平、不宜再緩、故國聯會行政院不應延期開會、以耗費此僅有之時光也、該報又謂、「英國採取何種政策、現為全世界各國所注目、美國政府曾要求以英國對於意阿爭端之態度、隨時通知華盛頓政府、至於蘇聯則在英國政策確定以前、對於意阿爭端亦不允作任何評判」云、泰晤士報則登載駐羅馬訪員電訊、內稱、「昨晚意國報紙登載消息、謂英法意三國於最短時期內、在羅馬舉行會議之一說、意國負責方面並未聞知、此項消息就共文字技術而論、原屬正確、蓋英法意三國並未提議舉行平常所謂「會議」、惟按照一九〇六年關於阿比西尼亞之三國條約、英法意三國中任何國對於阿比西尼亞有所行動、事前應先向其餘二國磋商、此種磋商、意國政府實難以拒絕、如意相墨索里尼與英法駐意大使在羅馬舉行磋商、則在各義上雖非會議、實則與召集三國會議未有以異也、但至目前為止、英法政府均尙未訓令駐意大使與意相舉行磋商、因此阿比西尼亞問題目前正陷於僵局、前途殊為混沌、一切均難預測、而阿比西尼亞境內目前正屬多雨季節、不復行軍、則亦時局混沌之一原因云、（廿二日哈瓦期電）</p>

<p>（倫敦）阿比西尼亞新任駐英公使馬爾丁、頃向每日快報記者發表談話、謂「余來英倫目的、係在獲得一宗借欵、蓋阿國政府需欵甚殷、不惟為應付戰事計、卽為開發國內礦產及其他經濟利源、亦在在需用鉅欵、阿比西尼亞蘊藏礦產至為豐富、吾人已準備加以開發、」並謂如果與英國財團談判、不幸失敗、則擬與現方在英之美國資本家摩根設法接洽、考慮在美國方面是否有獲得借欵之可能、按馬爾可來英使命、除接洽財政問題之外、尙有兩種目的、其一為向英國政府遊說、俾使其對於意阿爭端、出為阿國之後盾、並在國聯會方面努力、以期對於意大利實施制裁、例如封鎖蘇彝士運河、阻止意國軍隊通過、卽其一端、其二為請求英國政府撤消對阿比西尼亞禁運軍火之命令、馬爾又於談話中、詳述阿國軍備情形、謂已屯積大批軍械彈藥、如機關槍·魯易式步槍·遠射野戰砲·及防空高射砲等、購備尤多、至於毒瓦斯則决不採用、則以「此種戰具、在歐洲或尙有用之者、但以吾人視之、實為出於野蠻根性之瘋狂行動」云云、（二十二日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>（巴黎）據意國前任殖民部畏某君之談話、則意國對於意阿爭執之態度、約可撮述如下、意國並不重視此事之解决、任何解决應擔保意國兩點、（一）「安全、」不僅保障意國國境之安全、並得無限制控制阿國之軍事、（二）「擴張、」意國能如法國之於摩洛哥及英國之於伊拉克、殖民於阿比西尼西、藉此開化阿國、意國願和平解决此事、但戰事非其所畏、對於此事之解决决不妥協、意國對於凡爾賽和約已感失望、現正努力矯正已往之錯誤云、（廿二日國民電）</p>

<p>極力緊縮可望收支適合　被裁部隊已達十二萬人</p>
<p>南京通訊、四川財政廳長劉航琛、財政特派員關吉玉兩氏、於日昨飛京、向財部請示整理四川財政詳細辦法、記者前往訪謁劉氏、暢談一小時之久、言及四川財政及裁兵剿匪情形甚詳、茲記如次、（以下為劉氏談話）</p>
<p>四川財政情形一、支出方面、大別之約為四項、原支部隊經常費年約六千萬元、剿匪費約一千八百餘萬元、還債基金一千二百二十萬元、行財政費一千一百餘萬元、共計在一萬萬元以上、現經編遺軍隊、緊縮開支、並由行營負担剿匪費、支出數目、計部隊經常費年約四千萬元、還債基金一千二百二十萬元、行財政費一千一百餘萬元、共計六千三百餘萬元、二、收入方面、原收數目、鹽稅正附稅年約一千五百萬元、田賦七百五十餘萬元、特徵軍費二千二百七十餘萬元、特稅一千二百萬元、地方稅一千五百萬元、印花烟酒稅三百餘萬元、雜稅四百三十餘萬元、屠宰稅一百八十餘萬元、共約八千一百餘萬元、繼因共匪竄擾南北兩岸、以致收入銳减、現有收入數目、約為鹽稅正附稅年約一千零三十萬元、田賦六百九十餘萬元、特徵軍費二千零七十餘萬元、特稅九百餘萬元、地方稅一千二百餘萬元、印花烟酒稅三百餘萬元、雜稅四百三十餘萬元、屠宰稅一百八十餘萬元、共約六千八百餘萬元、但以當局力謀節流、一切開支緊縮之後、尙可敷衍下去、此四川財政收支之大槪情形也、</p>
<p>極力節省開支自本人（劉氏自稱）返川時、四川善後督辦劉甫澄氏所直轄部隊軍餉、每月支出、已達二百九十四萬餘元、當時劉督辦卽自動裁减官兵三萬人左右、餉額减至二百四十餘萬元、二月份以後、又自行再度縮减為二百十餘萬元、三月份各軍交出防區後、連同各軍餉額、共三百七十餘萬元、加被服及其他雜費、各部隊經常費總額每月約四百二十萬元、各軍事機關及軍實補充費、每月總額為七十八萬三千餘元、兩項合計、每年約支經常費六千萬元、</p>
<p>川軍限期編遣今日四川財政、已有收支適合之希望、其樞紐則全在於裁兵、故蔣委員長於六月三十日、以「卅秘蓉電」令飭縮編三分之一、限於七月十五日以前完竣、在本人此次東下前、所得各方消息、裁編减少之經費、巳年達一千五百萬元、劉督辦並於本月十八日飛渝、盡力緊縮軍事機關及軍實補充費、委員畏電令所定之限度、最短期內、當易辦到、</p>
<p>編遣後之財政此次編遺之後、四川財政、當有餘裕、卽以所餘之欵、及將來開源之收入、如房捐營業稅等等、第一步於最短期內歸還省政府接收防區時所負之債、第二步以所餘欵項移充建設經費、此次裁編經費、遵照蔣委員長規定、只耗去一百四十萬元、將來縱有增加、為數亦復有限、此皆由於各軍事長官澈底覺悟、故能以十五天之最短期間、一百四十萬元之最少經費、編遣部隊達十二萬人以上、在前方剿匪最劇烈之今日、而能收此成績、非蔣委員長之毅力、不克臻此、</p>
<p>來京向部請示編遺辦法、委員長已明令實施、在節流方面、已吿成功、本人此次奉命東下、係向財部請示整理財政詳細辦法、以便遵循、決定今晚赴滬、一周後卽行返川、將來確定辦法如何、容再奉告、今日農村破產、减輕民衆負担、為舉國上下一致之主張、本人辦理川省財政、亦應盡力於斯、凡屬於省府者、現已經减輕、屬於省府以下者、刻正照行營所頒辦法、分令各縣查報、現已具報者九十餘縣、約達全省三分之二、將來返川、卽恊盡力着手整理縣市地方財政、至於剿匪情形、已紀載各報、最近各要隘地方、如土門·疊溪·等處、次第收復、已能將匪區整個針鎖、前途甚可樂觀云云、</p>

<p>申時社云、本市銀行公會為救濟通貨緊縮、經議决辦理發行銀行承兌匯票、流通市面、刻已經小組委員會議定、預定基金為三千萬至五千萬元、作為承兌匯第二担保品、並已商得中央銀行允准辦理再貼現、約在八月中可實行、特探誌詳情如下、</p>
<p>創行銀行承兌匯票</p>
<p>自滬埠　金融潮頻起後、致造成通貨緊縮規象、工商業對資金之流通、備戚痛苦、本市中國交通上海浙江興業等各大銀行、有鑒及此、經連日開會集議、密商結果、將建議銀行公會、創辦銀行承兌匯票、經銀行公會上次會議通過原則交小組會辦理後、刻已將詳細辦法製定、俟提交銀行公會常會及會員大會通過後、卽實行、工商對該項辦法、亦均表示贊同、故實現决可無問題、</p>
<p>銀承兌票二重担保</p>
<p>銀行公會為辦理銀行承兌匯票、已决定令由銀行準備委員會、另舉辦一票據承兌所、負責辦理銀行承兌匯票事宜、凡工商客戶有確實之貨物、卽可向該所請領承兌匯票、經所方估定價格後、開予相當銀額之匯票、工商客戶卽可持票向任何會員銀行貼現、流通極為便利、同時信用方面、除特定之貨物為實質之第一担保品外、並有銀行公會聯合準備庫所認定之基金為第二担保、故其信用、較諸個別銀行所發行之本票、尤為可靠、將來外埠方面、並可辦理押匯、其流通範圍極廣、</p>
<p>增流通籌碼五千萬</p>
<p>此次銀行公會辦理銀行承兌匯票、其總票額限止規定約為三千萬至五千萬、其第二組保之基金部份、决由全體會員銀行三十六家分別認定、現正進行接洽中、故該項承兌匯票實行後、金融方面、無形中卽可因此增加流通籌碼三千萬至五千萬、不但工商界之資金、可因此而流通、卽銀行公會本身、亦可藉此項匯票而有所調節、</p>
<p>限定各業承兌數量</p>
<p>此項銀行承兌匯票、現由銀行公會聯合準備庫積極籌備中、預定八月中可望實現、蓋秋間農產物品將登塲、內地農村及工商界、對資金需要必殷、故有從速實現之必要、又據可靠方面息、此項承兌匯票、對各業均有嚴格分配限制、主要者如麵粉花紗雜糧油類水泥、及國貨工廠生產品質出口貨物等、視各業情形需要、各限定相當數量、其承兌主旨、則以發展國貨生產事業、及扶助出口目的、至承兌票之期限最多不得超過四個月、</p>
<p>中央銀行允轉貼現</p>
<p>銀行公會創辦銀行承兌匯票、為擴展流通範圍起見、有請中央銀行辦理再貼現之必要、故已數次派員非正式前往接洽、以事關救濟金融、已予允准、依照商業承兌匯票辦法、辦理銀行承兌匯票再貼現等業務、故將來各銀行方面、感覺吸收該項票據過量時、卽可向中銀辦轉貼現、以維穩定云、</p>

<p>近幾天委實悶熱得夠了，蟄居鬧市裏，過着厭倦的生活，常想到鄉村去欣賞碧綠的原野，吸收淸新的空氣，可是勞役羈身，怎容你逍遙自在？一昨適值星期，劍秋博士及業裕伉儷來訪，歡談片時，願盡半日之遊。有的說海濱沐浴，裨益身心；有的說園游野餐，別饒風味；我便翻開申報，想找個特殊去處，驀地看到大達新輪招待來賓，試航吳淞的新聞，浦江納凉，正是我們消暑的一法，終於取得一致的同意。午餐方罷，趨車至大達碼頭登愉。</p>
<p>大達爲大中華船廠所承造，外觀旣十分優美，內部又非常富麗。不到一句鐘來賓千餘人，從都市裏擠出來，想必與我們表示同情的。一時十分解纜，輪埠萬衆歡呼，樂聲與爆聲應和，十六舖的空氣，大爲震動！輪出楊樹浦，主人以汽水，啤酒，茶點欵待賓客，至爲慇懃。我們一邊吃，一邊遙覽歇浦兩岸的野景，久矣不履郊外，就分外覺得鄉村的可愛。輪出淞口約十里，乃循原綫折回，共費三時又半，打破了預算四小時的紀錄。我們在歸程中參觀全輪谷部，深佩大達實施科學化的設備與管理，實爲我國內河航輪之冠。</p>
<p>輪上晤總經理張孝若先生，承吿大達公司卅載以來，由奮鬥而興盛，由頓挫而複興，感創業的艱難，改進之匪易，現當國內經濟恐慌之時，以五十萬鉅資建此新輪，聊盡繼往開來的夙願。聆他一席話，使我憶起通海先賢張嗇公，當年力主利用厚生，創實業，興教育，關交通，籌善舉，那種偉大的精神與功績，的確使後人肅然起敬！如嗇公者，求之當世，能有幾人？</p>

<p>被不景氣侵襲着的都市裏，謀生，似乎不是容易的一伴事，而更其是小本經紀的，感到困難。但是我的鄰家魏老頭，却是一個例外的。</p>
<p>魏老頭今年近五十了，精神很好。他說，我的壯健的身子，便是我的資產。一年三百六十五日，他是每天都是天才發白，就起來的。他沒有固定的驗業，他的驗業，是隨着時季變更的。在這幾天裏，他是負販着適於這個時季裏的冷飲品。如二個子兒一盃的酸梅湯，有時賣着三個子兒一盃的冰其林或刨冰。開片西瓜，自然也是他每年所賣的。雖然這些東西，是衛生家見着皺眉的，但他却靠此度過整夏的吃喝。</p>
<p>待到天凉之後，他便賣「蘇州嫩塘藕」，或是「白花百合」，或是「沙角菱」。有時，若是資本充裕些，他便賣着「大閘蟹」。總之，他瞧着那一樣的利息厚，他便賣甚麽。冬季裏，他總是在弄口賣「烘山芋」。初春季節裏，委直沒甚賣，他便賣靑菜。但是在暮春時節，他是叫賣小黃魚，或到鄉下去弄些柳枝桃花來叫賣着，撈錢。而端午，中秋，以及新年裏的那些佳節上，他也是不肯輕輕地放過的。</p>
<p>他的兒子阿大，是賣粢飯的。但他在賣粢飯之外，在春天是帶賣着粽子，秋天，帶賣着窩熱藕，冬天，帶賣酒釀圓子。在夏季裏，照例是把粢飯桶撒了，改成冷麪攤，帶賣涼粉和陰凉綠豆湯。</p>

<h3 id="c171">西門掌舊 <a href="#c171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>— 上海通社</p>
<p>上海通社有一個「掌四門之舊」的計劃，今天，宣布掌西門。</p>
<p>話西門的時候，却是從西門外說起，更是在上海有縣城以前說起；這就是要先說那「黃家闕」。</p>
<p>現在西門外，有一條黃家國路，是很有名的。論起這塊地方，該是早就有名了，原名元代黃銘是住在這裏的。他的住宅呌做西郊野趣軒，人家稱他爲西郊先生。那時候上海還沒有縣城，但已設縣，縣治正是後來建城舊地的中心；所以，西郊就等於後來所謂「西門外」，而黃家闕的得名，正是因爲黃銘住過在此地。</p>
<p>住在西門附近的人，有一個便捷的寫意的去處正如住在呂班路，北四川路底，膠州路……那些地方一樣，因爲他們很可以把文廟公園（即上海市民衆教育館）當做自己的家園正如顧家宅公園，虹口公園，膠州公園一樣。說起文廟，就是從前的學宮，它和西門大概是緣分很深吧，雖然從東門搬到了西門，却又搬過回去，但是結末了兒仍舊在西門。—元代元貞元年（一二九五），上海縣學始就鎮學改成，本來是在東門，至大三年（一三一〇），瞿霆發助田，把它請到了西門門；延祐元年（一三一四），縣丞王珪又掮它回了老家。這樣，路過了明代，又　過了淸代六朝，到了咸豐三年（一八五三），八月初五那天，霹靂一聲，小刀會佔據了縣城；原來不如滿淸官書那樣的對於革命者反宣傳，小刀會却是知道尊崇文化的，雖則遭清軍包圍，苦守城中，還能夠廣設義塾，訓育人民。倒是淸軍得了手，進了縣城，就把學宮燒得一精二光。戰事平定後，學宮復興，這回又定位於西門。倘使沒有這樣一來，現在的文廟公園怕要給住在東門的人以最大的方便，而我們也要把它在「東門掌舊」裏去閑話了。</p>
<p>西門內有文廟，成了儒教的中心；西門外却有一個道教的中心—就是海上白雲覜，前門在方斜路，後門在肇周路，內容很是不小。光緒八年（一八八二）它的起始時，原來是小小的一個雷祖殿；過了六年後，領了道藏，遵照京師白雲觀的成例，定爲「十方叢林」，才改了現在的名稱，而規模也日益宏大了。</p>
<p>白雲覜的間壁，是一所著名的教會女學—裨文女學，它的命名，是紀念裨治文教士及其夫人Rev．&amp;　Mrs．E．C．Bridgman的。兩位裨治文是美國基督教公理會的宣教師，在道光二十七年（一八四七）到上海開教。</p>
<p>裨文女學的斜對過，是一所著名的教會醫院—婦孺醫院，它的原名譯音是「瑪格烈·韋廉遜醫院」Margaret　William　on　Hotpital，美國女公會教士羅司耐德所創辦，專爲婦孺診疾，尤致力於辦產科，事爲紐約韋廉遜女士所聞，就慨然把伊數十年的積蓄一起捐給了這所醫院，這就是婦孺醫院原名得名的綠故。婦孺醫院創立於淸光緒十一年（一八八五），今年（一九三五）五月十一日舉行五十週紀年。</p>
<p>走到了婦孺醫院，如果向東沿大吉路走幾步，就可以回到我們聞塲時所說的黃家闕路；再如果向南進尚文路，別忘記就是從前的尚文門（小西門），向北進肇嘉路，別忘記就是　鳳門（老西鬥）。好了，再見。</p>

<h3 id="c172">今日的閒談偶語 <a href="#c172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>— 伊峯</p>
<p>近來各種刊物常有「閒談偶語」這一欄，在這里面所講的，大都儘是夠人頭痛的東西。這麽一來，有些人難免就着急起來了。大學不甘寂寞，也來辦刊物，也來「閒談偶語」一下，也想來稱稱別人，急起直追。</p>
<p>他們的稱法，浮表上看起來，是多少還帶點紳士學者氣的。他們似乎並不怎樣破口罵人，計塵器以也總還曲曲折折。可是明明酒酣耳熟，一陣人張三長，李四短的說長道短了，但他們卻要裝得毫不在首的神氣，裝得溫文爾雅，娓娓清談，低低耳語，好像大有一笑置之的狂士風度。所以，他們假是在那里要對誰某口誅筆伐，他們都可不稍露青藍色，因爲他們明明說過自己是在閒談，是在偶語。這不很明白的嗎？閒談原是無拘無束的上天下地的亂談，偶語，不過偶然想到，低低地自己人說說罷了，這那里還可以當真？你自己要去信他，那就當然我不負現任，因爲在我祇　是威慨系之！如此而巳。</p>
<p>辦法是插聰明的，祇可惜的是屁股頭終於不免還要露出了條尾巴。譬喻說：談到你也不興，他也興之類，那麽要問誰興哩？當然祇　有他自己了，雖不明說出來，也就不言而喻了。「談」翁之意，原祇在此。</p>
<p>其次，他們的閒談偶語，因爲目的在反功別人或事實，當然是有的之夭了，不同於上天下一的胡扯。所以他們的談鋒語氣也就專門對准了某些人而發。因此就成了也惟有某些人纔是他們的深　大敵，此外就從有強梁大盜剪徑穿窬者流，也無關乃公一毛一髪，不但可以置之不聞不問，如果於巳有利，還不妨勾勾搭搭，以留方便。這樣的紳士學者神氣，真是要漢觀止了</p>
<p>從前的時候，有人說里蒼村言是毫不足信的，但到現在看來可不盡然了。在今日，惟有文人之言，纔是大半都完全虛誑。正經話固不必論，就是閒談偶語，也竟成了另有用心。如上的那種稱法，就是一例。</p>
<p>說到這裏，我倒愛起里巷村言來了；因爲雖是鄙野，卻還天真，而荒誕，卻也毫不遮掩，所以就可愛了。但這點，你還能從今日文人閒談偶語裏得到百分之一的真實嗎？真時阿門！</p>
<h3 id="c173">關於「擬人法」 <a href="#c173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>— 王集叢</p>
<p>高爾基曾說：「我們常常聽着。「風在哭」。「在鳴咽」。「月亮沉思似的照着」。「波浪想要搖動岩石。岩石對於波濤的打擊雖皺了一下臉，但並不爲爲波濤所敗。」「長統靴子不原意被腳穿。」「玻璃淌着大汗。」——雖然玻璃並沒有發汗神經。</p>
<p>「凡此一切，都是想使我們易於了解自然現象的「擬人法」。在此，我們是在將自身人類的性質附與人所見着的一切之物。」</p>
<p>夏目漱石在其有名的「文學論」中，將「擬人法」歸入於「射出語法」內，並作了這樣一個解說：</p>
<p>「我語言上最富於情的，自應附隨於最有情的我們人類，如笑，如怒，都有表現情的浩劫物之本質的資格，故用這些語言所寫出來的東西，顯會征聘躍然的情結，而且自然要呌起有活氣的狀態，這也是無可疑的了。況且當解釋宇宙萬象時，爲其標凖者乃是自己個人，紛繞自己周圍的事體，一概被攏到這個中心，爲自己的情結所處決；換言之，我們有一種傾向，動輒要移自己的情結去理會他物。這個，我現在姑名之曰射出語法（Projevtive　language），意即把自己射出（Project），說明外界的手段，所謂擬人法或Prospopoeia都應該包含在這里面。」</p>
<p>「我們日常無意中所用慣的語言里面，可以爲此語法適例者意外地多。如「雨腳渡江」，「木葉的私語」，「抽屜的把」，在歐語如「縫眼」，「鋶吉」等，都是道地的射出語法。」</p>
<p>高爾基和良自漱石的解說都是對的，不過，我在此還有一點補充：</p>
<p>所謂「擬人法」，乃是作家在其文學作品中對自然現象的擬人的描寫法則。因爲文學是藉着潔的形象的力來傳達人類的思想與感情的，所以用表白人間的生活現象的詞句去表明某種自然現象，使那種自然現象與人間的生活現象，因而與我們的思想和感情結合起來，其結果必將增強其傳達思想與感情的能力。譬如，在描寫天快晚了時，寫着「黑夜從遠山到來」（雖然黑夜並沒有腳），比較直率地寫成「天漸漸地黑暗了」，必然是更要使人髮生興趣的。</p>
<p>我們知道，每一個作家在其作品中所表現的都必然是一定的社會思想與感情，其對於自然現象的描畫也不過是在企圖強化其表現的思想與感情罷了。所以，作家之用「擬人法」去描畫自然現象也和其整個創作方法一樣，是爲其所要表現的思想與感情的內容所規定着的；是通過了他的世界觀，他的心情的；並不是其憑空的幻想。譬如，我們的大詩人李白，他就喜歡用「擬人法」來描畫自然，但他的此種描寫法則在各處都是與其意識相結合着的。現在，且隨便舉他的一首詩——「月下獨酌」來看罷——</p>
<p>「花間一壺酒一，獨酌無相親。舉杯邀明月，對影成三人。月既不解飲，影徒隨我身。暫伴月將影，行樂須及奢。我歌月徘徊，我舞影零亂。醒時同交歡，醉後各分散。永結無情遊，相期邈雲漢」。</p>
<p>這首詩，不僅表現出了李折之能適當巧妙地應用「擬人法」去描畫月夜獨飲時的情景，而且這樣的描畫是加強了由這詩中流露出的他的孤獨頹廢的心情之藝術的表現力；假使李白的孤獨頹廢的心情及由此引出來的他的詩意，是從當時的貴族的沒落情結所産生的，那麽，他在此所用的「擬人法」，也是與沒沒落貴族的情結結合着的。因爲要沒落的集團，才會感到孤獨，才需要離開現實，離開人羣，「舉杯邀明月」，以消解其愁悶和悲傷。</p>
<p>再如大家所知道的郭沫若的「瓶」，期中也有許多自然現象是被　作者用「擬人法」描畫出來的，例如：</p>
<p>「梅花呀，我謝你幽情，</p>
<p>你帶回了我的青春。</p>
<p>我久巳幹涸的心泉，</p>
<p>又從我化石的胸中飛迸」。</p>
<p>其實梅花並不是多情的姑娘，那里來的「幽情」呢？它也沒有手腳，又何能爲人「帶回」什麽東西呢？不過他的東西，乃至凡是與其愛人有關係的東西，都是「有情」的。郭沫若的「瓶」，是頹廢的小市民的戀愛至上主義的「情詩」，戀愛至上主義的感情可說是充滿了這詩作的全篇，這里所描畫的梅花，便是一個詩人的愛人贈與他的，所以在那詩人的感覺中，梅花便是很「有情」的，於是，梅花便被擬人化了。這樣的描寫當然是加強了詩中所表現的熱情，也就加強了作者所表現的戀愛至上主義的情感。因此，我們可以說「瓶」中所用的「擬人法」，是被當時作者的小市民的戀愛至上主義的意識規定的。</p>
<p>總之，所謂「擬人法」也與一般的描情寫景的法則一樣，是由作品所表現的內容中流出來的；更進一步說是與作家的思想感情，與他的世界觀結合着的。至於要適當地應用這種方法去描畫自然，那不消說是要有的想像力；但豐富的想像力並非來自天空，而是由豐富的生活經驗與知識構成的；所以，最後說來，要適當地應用「擬人法」，必須要有豐富的生活經驗，要對一般社會生活有深刻的理解。因爲要對人生有深刻的理解，才能把自然現象與人生結合起來，統一起來，因而也才能用「擬人法」去描畫自然。譬如明月吧，在孤獨頹廢的李白的感覺中，是酒友；在戀愛詩人的感覺中，是美麗的姑娘；在想要在黑暗中去行竊的小偷看來，也許是很討厭的人；……假使你不理解這些人的生活和心情，那你在描寫他們的生活時，遇着浩月當空的情景，便就不能適當地用「擬人法」去描寫；這是非常顯然的事情。</p>

<p>三叔公和孩子們說故事，孩子們都喜歡他。不曾看過三叔公讀書，三叔公卻一肚子的故事——三叔公肚子里的故事，五十擔也擔不完。夏夜，吃過晚飯，男人和孩子都到屋後革塲上乘涼，孩子們便圍着三叔公要他講故事。三叔公的飯常是要晚些，等得不耐煩了，就公推一個人去三叔公家里望望。三叔公來了，孩子們即刻吵着，「不要吵，剛吃了飯，飯也還在喉管里，等我抽抽烟再講。」裝好黃烟，孩子替他點上火，一筒，兩筒，三筒，吼就跟着烟縷出來了。西遊記，封神傳中的故事，武松打虎，孔明借箭，薛仁貴大破摩天嶺，這些都是孩子們喜歡聽的。有時也講聊齋里的故事，喜歡聽，而心里又害怕自己遇着這樣的鬼，坐着不敢動。一個人回去睡，經過黑暗的地方的故意咳幾聲，彷彿後面有人跟着，拼命的開腳走。</p>
<p>三叔公是擔擔子的。三叔公的爸爸我沒有見過，據說也是擔擔子的，十四五歲的三叔公就跟着爸爸擔擔子，這樣承繼下來。我知道的時候，三叔公，擔了許多年擔子——是的，三叔公常常說，他看着我出世，就在河堤崩了的那年，一瞬眼，就那麽大了。三叔公不是長年擔擔子，而擔子也不是長年有得擔。三叔公還種田，三叔公也有自己的田地的，就在井邊，照三叔公的活是「手掌那麽大」，實在等於不曾井田。農忙的日子，做完他自己的田事，還替人做短工。三叔公氣力大，手腳活，插秧割禾都做得快，一個人比得上兩三個女人，田地多的幾家爭着請他。但三叔公的工錢也比別人多一倍，還得買燒酒給他喝，不然，工作準會少。</p>
<p>交了貨擔子，從城里回來，有時扁擔上掛着豬肉，不過一年也沒有好幾次。後來我年紀大了，和他上過多少回賭館，才要在贏了時才有這麽闊氣。他總輸的時候多，他輸了錢卻不介意，對我說：「賭博不是贏就是輸，賭博，賭博，是要「博」。一定贏，誰和你賭？」他贏了，這是「橫財」，什麽都買得多多，你出聲不要買太多，他就，「尴尬尴尬，要吃就吃夠，這麽小食狗。贏得的錢不吃做什麽？留着做屋嗎？命里發財就發財，不發財儉也沒有用。一個人勞勞碌碌就是爲吃，吃得一日算一日。出世不曾帶錢來，死了帶入土麽？」</p>
<p>「賭博！賭博！你看三叔公，不是連兒子也賭去了麽。」長輩這樣訓誡子姪。這里所說的是他的第二的兒子，在他七歲那年，說帶他到城里去，以後就不見回來，傳說就是爲了賭博。聽說孩子是賣難隣縣的本家，在後三叔公還去看了他幾次，人變得又白又胖，背着人就呌「爸爸」。事隔多年了，我贏了錢，兩人吃得又飽又醉，由到城回家，一路斷斷續續的談，拉拉扯扯，不知怎的就拉到那件事上去，我問他：「又不是多，僅僅兩個兒子，你怎麽捨得了賣難別人呢？」「唉，姪孫，這是剮心肝的事，我就不是人麽？但我那里有本事來養他？在我家裏受凍受餓，不如讓他賣難人家——有好吃，有好穿，有書讀。我的爸爸擔擔子，我擔擔子，要他也和我一樣嗎？」他這樣回答我。我不懷再問，究竟是輸了錢才賣兒子，抑是將賣得的錢輸了，沒有明白。</p>
<p>保善，三叔公的大兒子，在城里一家店里挑水燒飯。一年，善才，從前小學校裏的伙頭，做了排長，威威風風的回到縣裏來招兵，動了保善的心，說也要去當兵。三叔公卻看不起：「什麽也好做，去當兵——當兵賤過狗。養大了他了，我話他不聽，任他去做什麽都好。好人不做做歪人，讓他去吃吃苦才知道。」終於，保善和本村三個少年一齊跟着招兵的走了。</p>
<p>好幾天不見三叔公，大家都納罕，有人說那天還見他擔貨到城裏去。過了半年，他回來了，病着，人很廋，很衰弱，說是被軍隊捉去做擔夫，乘機逃走，一路乞食回來。</p>
<p>由他的堂弟作主，泉鳳叔和瑞清叔見證，將井邊的田賣去，辦理他的後事。晴朗的秋天的下午，三叔公夾在棺材中間，兩個人抬着，聽過他講故事的人，敲着銅鑼，撒着紙錢，送他到山地裏去。那裏，臥着他的父親，他的母親，他的兄弟。　（完）</p>

<p>— 德國施托謨著陳隱之譯</p>
<p>「下午很晚時候，我們在屋內已經把衣物洗好了，我們就到院子來，想把衣物晾在墓地中間那些木椿上面。鄒麗把衣服高捲在半膝上，把黑頭髪抹到耳機後面去，拿着小木凳從這個木椿走到那個木椿去。老太婆那裏正在靠椅上面打盹；我，我不是高個子啊，不能夠幫她的忙啊！」</p>
<p>說到這裏，跛腳瑪麗便站起來把她那衰弱的身軀伸直給我看。</p>
<p>「我坐在衣藍旁邊一個大石頭上面，正在注視鄰家底馬夫如何刷洗一匹金粟色的馬。我素來喜歡馬匹，你知道，我的父親也是一個馬夫。這的確是一匹好看的牲口；當牠把頭從陰影中轉到日光底下時候，毛片上就發起光來，燦爛得像金屬物一親。但我從馬腿上華麗的飾物看來，知道這馬一定不是鄰居出租的馬匹。「這馬是誰的？」我問鄒麗，她剛把小踏凳移到靠近我最後一根木椿旁邊來。「這馬麽？」她說，一面墊起足尖在踏凳上面把衣物晾掛起來，「這是那個外邦大學生的，我不知道他叫甚麽名字。」我抬頭看她，但她沒有轉過頭來，仍舊晾她的衣物。我正等得不耐煩時候，忽聽見背後一個聲音說：「娜麗小姐，算了罷，已經晾好了！」</p>
<p>「我還看見她怎樣把兩垂下來，趕快放下捲起的衣服；等我回頭一看，祇見那個高貴的蒼白面色青年站在我的面前，娜麗沒有說一句話就從踏凳上跳下來站在我旁邊。那個青年先生也祇站着，眼睛祇在娜麗身上，彷彿甚麽事情都忘記了。「碰着鬼了！」我想，於是我隨便說了些關於金粟色馬的話，我一直說下去，直至有人回答我；但不知不覺我們三個人都走過院子那邊去了。馬用蹄踏着地，並拿伶俐的眼光看牠的主人。娜麗站在馬旁邊，拿手掌撫摸光滑的馬頸，現出非常羨慕的樣子。「這馬是像綿羊那麽馴養的，」青年先生說，「娜麗小姐，你想騎一會麽，馬廐還掛着一個女人用的鞍子？」她搖搖頭；但我聽見她的呼吸短促了，她的確實發出快樂的光輝。這位伯爵先生很明白她的念頭的，因爲他使了一個眼色，別人就把鞍子裝到馬背上去並安下一個輕松的轡頭了。娜麗看着馬鞍，眼睛像受了魔術一樣。但當馬夫把上馬用的木踏凳放在她面前時候，那個青年先生便把這凳子移向一旁。「不用這個，約翰！」他喊，他便自然而然地一隻手抱起小姑娘。「把腳緊緊踏在我的手心吧！」他說，一面伸出另一隻手在她面前，同時抬起頭來凝視着她。娜麗彷彿唯命是從的樣子，把她的小腳踏在伯爵手裏。我看見伯爵遲疑了一會，但僅祇一會兒而巳，接着他便用一種迅速的動作把她送上馬去了。</p>
<p>「她在以鞍上坐着，面色慌亂得很，眼睛垂向地下，並耐心地讓他把韁繩緾在手指間。那馬搖搖頭，發出一聲長嘶。牠的主人在綢樣的鬃毛上撫摸了幾下，然後一隻手放在娜麗背後鞍上，另一隻手則挽着轡頭並慢慢地拉住馬冏繞那塊墓地兜圈子。」</p>
<p>「我必須說，這二個年輕人恰正可以配成一對；看見她這個模樣的人，絕不曾想到這美貌姑娘僅祇是一個做針綫的女人，一個裁縫女兒！」</p>
<p>「不久她就嫌馬走得還不快。她把手一揮，於是馬開始快跑，青年先生便放手退到草地上去。但他的沒有離開她一下，馬一面跑，他也拿着馬鞭兜圈子；他像着迷一樣，眼睛不斷地瞅着小姑娘，從她那隨風飄動的黑頭髮，看到鞍上從衣服底下露出來的那隻小腳。他有時對她喊，有時又對馬說了機個字。馬愈跑愈快，喘着息，把尾巴在空中擺動。娜麗簡直不注意這個。她祇　喪魂落魄地坐着，對這青年先生微笑着，眼睛釘着他，恰像是他的把她支持在馬鞍上似的。」</p>

<h3 id="c176">節約拯災 <a href="#c176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>— 瓊聲</p>
<p>去年旱魃爲虐之時，我們的時賢卽云：人禍之餘，繼以天災；大致是「福無雙降禍不單行」的所以罷，今年我們竟是受人禍複罹天災了！南起百粵之濱，北抵齊魯之域，警報傳來，零落的中國本土，幾乎泰半沉入水鄉，洪流汜濫！澧樊偃師，全市陸沉，宜沙等地，形同澤國，災縣數踰一百，難民以千萬計，廬舍田地，牲畜人民，捲入水波以喪生漂失者，實不知凡幾！若許我們撇去「人事未修」的話不說，許多「慈悲爲懷」的人，定必搔首跺足，椎心涕泣，三呼「昊天不弔，降此巨凶」哩！</p>
<p>慈悲固然慈悲，但是這一慈悲仍然不能打破這一方面是哀鴻遍野，餓以待斃，而另一方面則車馬服飾，樂以忘憂的慘絕人寰的對比。跳舞塲內，可以聽不到滬北的炮聲，冷氣間裏，又何常能看得見那些嗷嗷待哺的災黎，眞的，「使人而仁，何克至此」！</p>
<p>然而「民胞物與」，古有明訓，何况同舟共濟，率屬黃帝子孫？因之九六老人馬相伯先生有鑑乎此，「願國人俯鑑其忱」的疾呼：「衣齊紈而裹蜀錦者，當念災黎之赤其身而裸其體；飲芳冽而餐肥鮮者，當念災黎之嚙樹皮而嚼草根，居高堂而處大廈者，當念災黎之巢樹顛而穴土山，策駿馬而驅鈿車者，當念災黎之沉洪流而浮瀉波」，並「謹以節約救濟水災之議，進諸國人之前」。當然，我們也認爲，雞蛋上跳舞，必有跌碎之日，「使人而仁」，誰也贊成這一節約救災之舉。尤其是馬相伯所謂「野有餓莩，我獨飽食，人皆露宿，我獨燕居」的現象，實在是太不合理！</p>
<p>這種不合理的事實，所以須爲國人一再道及者，不僅是要將它唾棄，且值得我們嚴重的警惕！因爲年來有那種「愛國不敢後人」的仕女，「跳舞救國」，「寓愛國於娛樂」，很被他們採用爲「通力合作」的大道理；我們很可預言，這些老爺太太們於尋歡作樂中，揭此旗幟，恐將又大發其慈悲，實行其救災的「義舉」！</p>
<p>馬相伯先生的節約拯災運動，我想不應當是老爺太太們尋歡取樂的護符，不幫助他們作那種歡樂與「義舉」的「實至名歸」，這是牠的意義。</p>
<h3 id="c177">家 <a href="#c177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>— 是非</p>
<p>自從離別了故鄉，過着流浪生活，雖然表面上自欺欺人地說這是多麽自由自在的生活呵：但是在病中，或者碰到不如意底襲擊時，總憧憬着家的可愛，家的溫暖！</p>
<p>如果我有了家，生病時，不致獨自被遺棄在一角，呻吟着，痛苦着。卽使想吐吐自家的牢騷，人們那裏會聽得進這些殺風景的話，人們都有着一個我所沒有的家呵！如果我有了家，碰壁時，不致獨自在一角裏暗自飲泣，你想吿訴人們你的委曲嗎，人們是不喜歡聽那種不如意的事的，人們都有着一個我所沒有的家呵！</p>
<p>但是能保證自家不生病嗎，能夠永遠如意地在人海中浮沉嗎？然而終有蒼髮滿鬢的時侯，那個時侯家是更可愛更寶貴，「老年沒有家「是故鄉一句最引人眼淚的話！</p>
<p>自家已是到了接近暮境的中年，那末樣一半悠長的日子過着漂泊生涯。雖然在天的一角，我有着一個溫暖的家，而且是家的驕子底一個獨生子呵。爲了我的出走，父親用最動人的字句在報上登着要我歸去的吿白。我每天讀着父親從心底深處叫出來的，懺悔語，他已感到了「老年沒有家」底痛吿。一個溫暖的家不是爲了那個潑野的後妻而剝奪了快樂，他甚至不能保護一個前妻的獨生子，使我在年輕的時節就遭到了那樣底命運。我是深深地感到父親的痛苦，想忘了那種侮辱投到他的懷中去。但是事實上是要弄得更壞的，當我再出現在家中，的時候，或許我父親的痛苦將更甚了。就犧牲了自家的幸福讓父親在老年時有個家吧！</p>
<p>但是自家也到了中年了，已經是將近黃昏的人了，看到朋友們的融融洽洽底家，是那樣羨慕着而勾起一種莫奈何底煩惱。於是朋友們或明或暗地慫恿我結婚，但是我總是笑而不答。</p>
<p>記得誰說過妻子與馬桶是家的主要條件。要有個家，我自然得結婚；但是結婚是那樣容易的事嗎？一個孤獨的異鄉人，他是不能有那樣的奢望的。年輕時自家也鬧過戀愛，現在是空留着辛酸底回憶而已。</p>
<p>據故鄉傳來的消息，父親始終惦念他出走的兒子，我祝福他長壽，我終有一天帶着一顆純潔底心投到父親懷裏向他懺悔，我是屬於那個「家」的呵！</p>
<h3 id="c178">老了的心境 <a href="#c178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>— 啟筠</p>
<p>靜穆的伸夏之夜，沈寂的街頭灑着水一般淸麗的月光，黯藍而略帶明朗的天空嵌了微笑着的星子，獨個兒彳亍在淸幽的夜靜中，心是老了起來了。</p>
<p>拐過了一個轉灣，們而間，低下腦袋，瞧見自家那蹌跟的瘦影，愈近街燈便愈淡薄。好像是給那頹然無力的燈光吞蝕去似的。老了的心更加是添上一派黯澹的情緒。</p>
<p>月色中顯示出個明晰的輸廓的，而在頹然的街燈下，却被映沒了的瘦影，正是象徵了自家那憂鬱而陰晦的生命哪！</p>
<p>自從第一步踏進了生活的圈子，就彷彿雲雀兒給關入樊籠裏一般。水遠地，不會再得到所謂美麗的愉快的春天的日子底來臨。不獨是先蘊藏在年靑人的心腔裏的熱望，希冀，憧憬，儘像汹湧的海水中聲着礁石或堤岸似的，都化作水沫兒，悄悄地退去，悄悄地消逝；而且，從此就和那純潔，天眞，無邪的王國絕了緣，無可奈何地，在極端的不願意中，而走進另一個充滿了欺騙，虛偽，奸詐的地獄。——儘日裏埋在市儈商的惡劣的氛圍中，咬緊牙根，艱忍着人與人之間的陰險，狠惡，擠軋，和暗地裏藏了刀子的歡笑。</p>
<p>可是，我應該來學習生活的方法呢！——因爲，人生的道路上，尤其是在脫離童年的王國，而走進社會的這一段路程，多崎嶇的蜀道呵。——冷眼，歧視，軋擠，受人家的出賣，……這些，正是在意中的磨煉，做人是怎麽地痛苦的事呢！</p>
<p>因此，我現在學會了冷談，沈默。</p>
<p>一向老是愛好羅漫蒂克的小說和電影的心境也開始變了。而今，只喜歡把自家滲透在人世的苦味中，多體驗一些所謂「人情世故」。</p>
<p>生活，折磨年靑人的熱情的魔鬼哪！</p>
<p>但，有誰能避開生活（醜惡的現實底因素）如生存的呢？</p>
<p>呵，多可憐而又可飲仰的一回事啊！</p>

<p>— 野菲</p>
<p>嘡嘡嘡！嘡嘡嘡！嘡……嘡…………嘡……</p>
<p>——大家快去搶險呵！南鄉的東堤已經給大水冲坍了！</p>
<p>村子裏的人家都在睡夢中給驚醒了轉來，大家聽到了這樣恐怖的呼聲，金根和三德叔都不暇穿衣的一骨碌從床上爬了起來，走到門口看看，人是一羣又一羣的在門外流動着，鏜鑼聲和呼號聲只不住地在村子裏蕩漾，婦女的喊聲，孩子的哭叫，把整個的天地都震撼得動搖了起來。</p>
<p>雨，彷彿似倒般的傾瀉着，於是在每一個人的心中全有了個陸沉的恐怖！</p>
<p>「唉！天老爺眞是殺人放火了，坍了東堤，我們全村的人還會有命活嗎？」阿七老太一面模着牆壁走，一面嘮哩嘮叨的咕嘟。</p>
<p>「大水，大水！不想這裏也會發大水的。」仁生嫂從床上翻下來，開門出去一看；但見無數火把在屋簷下搖幌，許多頗長的影子却雜亂地在泥濘的地面上移過，而且都是那末匆忙失措的嚷着奔着。</p>
<p>嘡嘡嘡！嘡瞠瞠！嘡……嘡……嘡……嘡……</p>
<p>——人越多越好，快去呵！請大家帶些鐵耙繩索槓捧去！」</p>
<p>叱叱嚓嚓的脚步踐着水潭聲和呼叫聲鬧成了一片，一羣一羣的人，都向着南鄉蜂擁而去——</p>
<p>「三德叔快啊！」</p>
<p>「金根你還不快些，水就要向村裏冲進來了！」</p>
<p>大家全你埋怨我，我責備你的互相嗔怪着，但是除了彼此焦急之外，什麼辦法都沒有。</p>
<p>在東堤一帶低窪的地方，已經完全成了澤國，然而水還儘管地往裏面漲，漲，浜渚上一塊石碑也給淹沒了，接着禹王廟裏也進了水，堤岸早已給冲得干干淨淨。</p>
<p>人雖然是彷彿蟻羣般的擠了一大堆，幾支火把却在禹王廟的廊下閃耀，照徹得每一個人的蒼白臉上，更塗上了一層慘淒的色彩，然而大家都淋得差不多全像一堆落湯雞了。</p>
<p>「快堵，快堵，如果再讓它冲進來是靠不住了！」酒鬼金友站在右邊高岸頭上拚命的喊！</p>
<p>「別噪！先鋸松樹來打椿，不然爛泥石頭都要冲掉的。」</p>
<p>「石頭，石頭，快搬石頭來。」</p>
<p>「挑泥，快！快！來不及了！」</p>
<p>黃泥石塊都紛亂地向决口處堵上去，但是急流的力很猛，所以儘管堆上去，它還是要全部退下來的。人頭是像浪潮一般的在大雨底下攢動；天雖然已經有些發亮了，可是雨還依舊不見止，决口裏的狂瀾也不住地望裏面流，從一尺至尺半，而二尺……</p>
<p>搶險的人，起先僅僅一般壯年男子，後來連了老年的，和許多婦女，茶至較大的孩子們都去參加相帮了；他們一整夜運泥搬石的工作，人已疲憊得像一條老蠶了。然而滔滔的大水却儘向陸地泛濫着，不到第二天的中午，全村已成了注洋大海，許多人家的傢具東西全在水面上盪漾，人是爬在樹上或屋上求救，哭的哭，叫的叫，生命是只在死亡綫上了，還有不少浮屍在水面上淌。</p>
<h3 id="c180">苗婦 <a href="#c180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>— 尤其</p>
<p>從四川出發，沿着川黔的山道走着，經過了綦江的縣城，交到了貴州的邊界。假使你留意的話，不久的時侯，你就會知道在這裏有宙人的寄居，說不定還能看見苗人生活的一種姿態。</p>
<p>眞的，苗人在開化的城市裏是很少見的，或者簡直可以說沒有，爲了生活，她們或許是不願意到外省去經營什麼事物，於此，在山窩子裏，便種下了很深的根基。</p>
<p>不用說，山窩子對於行旅是非常不方便的，沒有交通的利器，把外面的空氣阻礙住了。自然，因了自然的趨勢，呈現了極明顯的退化，但，都會間的繁榮不住的進展，因了這，隨便你山窩子是怎樣的艱難，可是牠的文明終能打進了一些進去。</p>
<p>許是機緣的湊巧吧？在步入了黃州的第二天，就發現了苗婦的活動跳躍在我們的眼前。</p>
<p>那是一種什麽人呢？當初我問着，懷了驚奇的神情。</p>
<p>苗子，張伕頭說。這裏是很多的。</p>
<p>我沒有再說什麼，不過，在裝束上和言語上，確給了我一種新奇的感覺，然而這感覺，不久也就平復下去。</p>
<p>有人說，小的民族是可以被大的民族同化的，爲了事實上的需要，在相互間絕不能斷絕了往來，這樣，漸漸地，田語言習慣而至日常的生活，都在由遠的距離而變爲近的溶洽了，雖則在服裝上仍有些差異，也有一部份躲在少見人跡的深谷裏實行自樂的耕食。</p>
<p>或許是他們一種獨特的性格，在交易上，他們多由婦女們擔任，所擔任的，又多是些流動性的叫賈，從這裏到那裏，或者計算着什麼時候有「趕集」。</p>
<p>爲什麽不開設店面做比較適意的交易呢？這，並不是不想，被經濟的力量束縛着，而且，以誠懇的經歷對付着圓滑的手腕，結果，失敗的成分是濃厚的。</p>
<p>無論在什麼地方，爲了不景氣的侵襲在同樣的受着淘溶，於此，恐慌鞭撻着她們的心頭，有的也拋掉了家庭受雇於人，有的去採取山裏不費本錢的天然產物擔到市上去叫賣。假使你在省城裏面，就可以聽到苗婦的叫賣的聲音。</p>
<p>當夏天將沒的時候，山裏的產物熟了，黃了，那末，你聽吧：</p>
<p>—買吧，好大的刺梨喲！（註）</p>
<p>然而，當夏天滑了過去，當刺梨的時期跑過去的時候，也絕不會感到沉默的，旁的字眼又會很淸脆的躥進了你的耳中。</p>
<p>衣服，都是土布做的，愛美，是人類的天性，有的人在士布上加印了顏色，成者拿棉綫挑織成了花紋，袖子是那樣的寬大，像和尚一樣，下身，穿了有皺摺的裙子，腿脚裸着，用長的布帶像兵士的綁腿似的，由膝蓋下捆紮到腳腫，腳上是穿了草鞋的，頭上纏了布圈，有些在頭髮上還挿了幾根銀籤，這樣，在她們間，便很足以誇耀了。</p>
<p>如果可能的話，買一點她們織成的「苗錦」，倒是非常細緻的。</p>
<p>總之，她們的體質是剛強的，精神是耐苦的，有自立的本能，被都市間的物質文明所薰陶下的婦女，那是不能相比擬的。</p>
<p>註：刺梨，山中的一種植物，圓形有刺，含有酸味。</p>

<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>我有一位妹妹，現年二十一歲，在二年前與某君結婚。不料在數月前，某君竟因病逝世了。她的公婆看她年紀很輕，又沒有生育過子女，所以很主張她改嫁，而她因爲亡夫在世的愛情關係，一時不忍談什麼改嫁的問題，所以別人也不好積極去勸她改嫁了。不過她的亡夫有好幾位弟兄，都娶了嫂嫂，她們看我妹妹年幼，常常欺她，所以妯娌之間，實有不能同居之概。現在公婆未死，我妹妹還有依靠，假使兩老去世，她的伯叔妯娌豈不是更要欺她嗎？那時她孤立無助，我家又不富有，她的生活一定要發生危險了，所以她想在公婆未死之前，要求析產，以求將來之保障。不知寡媳對於舅姑有要求析產權否？伯叔妯娌們可以阻止嗎？請你給我一個答覆。</p>
<p>敬請</p>
<p>撰安　　葛昌盛敬上</p>
<p>編者按：葛君妹妹的舅姑能夠打破一般人的舊習慣，在兒子死後，爲媳婦將來的幸福着想，勸她改嫁，其思想實屬可佩。至於他妹妹旣一時不忍談到改嫁，那也是人情之常，在最近時期內，當然不必積極去勸她，以免引起她的痛苦的回憶，只好等將來看機會再談了。</p>
<p>現行法令，規定家長財產，子女不得要求分析，但有特別情形者，許其通融。譬如「寡媳之於舅姑，嫡子之於庶母，其已情同陌路，勢難強合者，准其析產分居。」現在葛君的妹妹和她的舅姑相處，當然沒有到「情同陌路，勢難強合」的程度；但伯叔妯娌之間，如果有確實證據，足以證明有急謀日後生活保障的必要者，也可以提出析產的要求。</p>
<p>根據來信所述，她的舅姑對於她的威情似乎並不壞，所以此事最好先直接向舅姑說明苦衷，請他們作主，我想他們或者有更好的方法來幫助她吧。</p>

<p>『船家女』是沈西苓繼「鄉愁」後導演的一部對白歌唱聲片，現已全部吿竣了。</p>
<p>「船家女」的故事，是描寫一個西湖中的划船的女兒，她愛上了一個織工，但被一個有閒的遊湖的靑年所窺見而破壞了他們的愛情，圓滿了自己的好夢，把她囚在籠子裏的鳥兒那麽地玩弄着，在這兒作者站在「人本位」的觀點上，來代替那些被侮辱女子，作一個沉痛的呼號。</p>
<p>該片的主演者，有高占非，徐來，孫敏，梅熹等人，老高在這兒飾一個工人，這再合適他的個性也沒有了，在「船家女」裏，他顯然有着驚人的表現，徐來孫敏梅熹等，也都有新的姿態出現。導演沈西苓，他有比「鄉愁」更進一步的新收穫。</p>

<h3 id="c187">築橋墩之圍堰法 <a href="#c187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>— 小昂</p>
<p>錢塘江大橋，興工刻已數閱月，工程之浩大，實爲國內所少見，小昂此次乘來杭實習之便，得與該工程處張工程師晤面。是夕適逢橋梁專家美人某君作公開學術演講，申論橘墩之建築極詳，聽後復得實地見習之機會，所獲甚多，茲縷述於後，公開研究。</p>
<p>橋墩之鞏固，關於全橋之生命甚巨，蓋橋身有壞，頗易修理，而橋墩坍陷，則全橋盡矣。築墩之法，隨地而異，視河流緩急，河床之結構，河水之深淺，與乎建築家之審察而定，普通可分爲三。</p>
<p>（一）圍堰法—用於河深在十五呎以下，</p>
<p>（二）汽箱法—在深度不滿一百十呎用之；</p>
<p>（三）深掘法—河水極深時用之，今將圍堰法法申述於下，其他二法客後另篇詳述。</p>
<p>圍堰法係將築墩地點，用不滲透而堅固之堰四面包圍，乃將堰內之水用打水機抽出。在此枯涸之堰內乃築橋墩，此法費用甚廉，且易工作，但因河水之壓力及滲透，不易克制故在河深十五呎以上，多不採用。若四面用鋼板打椿，則可增至三十五呎之深，然以安全計，多不用之，又若河水之漲落無定，則此法頗感困難。園堰之材料之相異，可分如下：</p>
<p>（一）士堰—此堰用泥土築成，因泥土不甚堅固而甚滲入，故用土易多，而佔地甚廣，苟隣近無大宗泥土及河水稍深而急流者，多不用之。</p>
<p>（二）岩堰—此堰用岩石疊成，而塗以泥土，以免罅隙之滲漏，此法用費較廉，蓋工作材料均較節省也。</p>
<p>（三）沙袋堰—此法以沙袋疊成圍堰，其厚則視水之深淺而定，因沙袋可移動，故稱便利。</p>
<p>（四）木堰—堰用木板椿互相鑲接打入河底而成，防鑲縫間之漏滲，有用二層者，亦有用木條鑲縫蓋住者，此法在河床岩層舖有軟質物者始有採用。</p>
<p>（五）鋼骨混凝土堰—此堰在岸上築成，分內外二層，藉可浮送至工作地點乃用重物沉入河底，河底舖有泥土，適以封其底端以防滲浸。</p>
<p>（六）冰堰，此法將河水圍以不導熱之物質，形如圍堰，乃將所圍之水用法使之結氷而成，此法用費最廉，但不易弄好。</p>
<p>用圍堰法築墩，困難不少，如河床沙層太厚，堰基不固，自流水來自河底，致堰內之水不能抽盡，以及意外之潮漲，堰墻之傾頹，均須建築者隨時隨地設法解决之難題也。</p>
<h3 id="c188">建築史話（一） <a href="#c188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>— 不忍</p>
<p>在歷史開始以前，人類方面無所謂建築。最初的房屋非當粗糙，非常簡單，是用最輕便的方法把最現成的材料湊集而成的。枝條編成的茅舍，石塊砌成的圍牆，木頭堆成的小屋，諸如此類的房屋，除藉以抵避風雨以外，就沒有其他意義了。人類以這樣幾與巢穴無異的房屋爲住所的時期，約達數十萬年；然後文化發達的埃及人開始建造屬於正當的建築型式的房屋，這些房屋纔是只爲人類所有而非任何其他動物所有的作品</p>
<p>埃及人有很多很多精美的容易施工的合建築用的石料，氣候又很佳妙，沒有泳霜雨霧，所以那些不曾被人力毀壞的建築物到現在還存在着，幾乎和初建時一樣完好。這些建築物的堅固巨大，使後代的人們休想加以毀壞。這就是埃及古王們當初那樣地建造的用意。他們所最想望的，是藉以貯藏他們自己的木乃伊的永垂不朽的墳墓。可是，雖然埃及古王打算死後的墳墓比活時的住屋更加週到，但堂皇的宮殿和略帶猙獰與神秘的大廟宇的遺蹟現在也有不少存在着</p>
<p>我們想，假如沒有富於服從心的人民與成千成萬的奴隸和俘虜，專橫的埃及古王就决不能造成他們的巨大的石碑的，因爲當時的工具和機械都非常簡單，除依賴人畜的氣力外就無從拉曳和放置那些又巨大又笨重的石塊了。實在，不必從銘刻在建築物上的文字，光是從建築物本身，我們就可以很華確地猜想當時的埃及是怎樣的一個團家；宮殿與墳墓的巨大的柱石，現在還存留着，正好替當時埃及人的生活方式做證據。</p>
<p>在叙利亞與波斯，也有大廟宇給建造着，「占屋家僧人」在這些廟宇的上層觀察屋象，預言未來。埃及人的建築用石梁，叙利亞人和波斯人的建築添上磚造的拱廊和圓屋頂，希臘人的建築雖不用拱廊和圓屋頂，却是從這些早期試驗蛻化而成的。</p>
<p>我們所知道的最早的希臘建築是粗糙而強固的，例如仿傚石造廟宇的木造廟宇。早期的以靑銅爲飾物的木造廟宇早已頹壞了。可是，逐漸逐漸的，希臘人成爲最顯赫的建築家，他們的建築師和彫刻師至少足與任何前人或後人媲美</p>
<p>雅典的阿克洛頗里（Acropolis）（可愛的高大的廟宇衛城），大多數在耶穌紀元前十五世紀間建造的，一直是而且仍然是世界奇蹟之一。這些用蜜色的大理石造成的，多柱的房屋，可以說是完全的建築物。它們的比例，它們的光與蔭的型式，它們的支柱的大小形式與位置，它們的嵌綫，它們的乾淨的彫刻，一切都顯得正確合式。</p>
<h3 id="c189">從建築藝術說到希臘的神廟（三） <a href="#c189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>— 孫宗文</p>
<p>——世界建築史蹟上最光榮的一頁——</p>
<p>（二）希臘神廟建築之特點</p>
<p>講到希臘神廟建築之特點，則我們可分成幾點來講。爲篇幅關係，略分成（A）方向，（B）屋頂，（C）門窗，（D）柱頭，（F）階石踏步，（E）建築材料，……等類。現分述於下：</p>
<p>（A）方向希臘神廟之建築其關係最重者，首推「方向問題。」因我們可知，神廟之目的，爲給「神」所居住；而希臘人以爲神與自然物最有關係，而其中尤以太陽最神祕：因此，神廟之建築，其方向就與太陽有密切的關係了。誰也知道，早晨的太陽，係從東方昇起的，而沉於西方，因此，希臘人蓋神廟時，其大門之方向，每每係朝東方的。門口直對神龕，其唯一之原因謂，因神廟爲給神所居住的，而世界上之太陽升於東方；故希臘人民每天朝晨到神廟中去朝拜神的時侯，因向東之大門直對神龕，而光綫卽直射入神的四週；其意義卽爲人們就可很光亮明淸的見到神的一切了。這就指希臘方面而言。至埃及之神廟，其方向不依白天的太陽爲根據，而依晚上天空之屋座爲標準的；此雖不涉本文範圍之內，但爲參考起見，現略把埃及神廟依星座之方向而爲方向之各種建築物，略舉數則於后，以見「神廟與方向」之關係一斑了。</p>
<p>一·西歷紀元前五千三百年，至一千八百五十年之間，埃及之神廟，乃依天狼星（Sirias）昇時之光綫，能射入祭堂中神眼而建設者。</p>
<p>二·埃及在Eottu等地之神廟，多依老人星（Canopus）於日出前光綫能射入祭堂中神眼而建設者。（Caruac）等地之神廟，則依西沒時老人星光綫能射入神眼而建築之。</p>
<p>三·西歷紀元前七千年頃鄧鐵拉亞之最古神廟，乃向織女星座（Vega）而建築者。</p>
<p>四·埃及人與希臘人常稱大角星（ArctuRus）爲「神殿之星」，乃示季節推移之重要目標也。</p>
<p>我們從上面四個例子看來；由此，我們可以證明到，神廟建築之方向，其對於自然界所謂神秘之物的太陽與星座，是有何等相互密切的關係性存在啊！</p>
<p>（B）屋頂希臘神廟建築之方式頗多，據羅馬某名建築師謂，希臘神廟之Plam約有十三種之多，然普通一般之方式，神廟殿堂之結構，大概爲長方形，周圍有各種柱頭圍繞着，左右及後面並無窗戶之開置，其前後部較兩惻面爲窄。而各神廟其屋頂則一致的皆作三角形式的，名之曰Pediment（三角墻）在其上，則以極精巧的手術，雕刻成各種紀念圖案，以點綴裝飾其上。其屋頂外部的形式，概爲三角形式的，足以表現其眞實的精神，以表顯其內部工程構造形式相同，絕不有一絲的虛偽作假的裝飾在上，由此，不虛偽，不作假，極忠實的表現出希臘人民族性之一斑。在屋頂上流露出來。</p>
<p>（C）門窗希臘之神廟，其建築上唯一之特點，還在於門窗問題上；因爲神廟的四週，是絕不開窗的，（雖然及至後來，有阿坡羅神廟Templeof　Apollo的出現，因其內部神龕之地位不建在中部，而建在旁邊，又因其大門的建築方向係朝北的，故在東邊的墻上，就第一次的在神廟上的墻壁上開了一窗；如此，早晨的陽光，又可從窗口直射到神像了。如此，雖有墻上開窗的神廟發現，但究屬少歡中的少數罷了；也可說是例外的。）牠祗在朝東方的墻上，開了一門戶，以備人民朝拜天神之用；但是，這樣說來，殿堂中的光綫問題，就令人有些疑惑了。因爲從小小一門口所射進的光綫，是絕不夠一大殿堂所能支配應用的。那殿堂中又豈不要感到黑暗了嗎？但是，我們又相信，因爲其內部之建築材料，大都係採用有發光體的物質如大理石，金，銀，寶石，之類；並且其屋頂內部又大概全用大理石片所舖成的。故我們從這一點上，又可推想出其四週就有不開窗戶的可能性了。又有一般人則主張其屋頂上爲開有窗戶的；但是我們從發掘出來的遺物上，亦無從考正了。因爲其屋頂之遺蹟，是極少留到現代的，故這一個問題，亦無從有相當的證明，一直到現在。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Rapid Decline in Han River Water Level Indicates the End of the Particularly Dangerous Period; Water Accumulation in Wuhan Streets Gradually Receding, Authorities Still Vigilantly Preventing Breaches, and Danger at the Wu-Hui Dyke Not Yet Averted <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>(Hankou) On the 22nd, the river water receded four inches, with the water level marker at 48.8. It is widely believed that the particularly dangerous period has passed. If it continues to recede below 48 feet, it will gradually transition to a safe period. The authorities are currently maintaining strict dike defense work to avoid any setback, while simultaneously making all-out efforts in disaster relief. (Special dispatch on the 22nd)</p>
<p>(Hankou) Today, the Hankou water level is at 48 feet 8 inches, receding another four inches from the 21st. The water level outside the Zhang Gong Dike is 51 feet, receding another eight inches from the 21st. The water upstream in Yichang has slightly risen, and the Xiang River in Yunyang rose more than ten feet on the 20th. The authorities have telegraphed their subordinates, ordering them to take strict precautions. (Special dispatch on the 22nd)</p>
<p>(Hankou) Although the accumulated water in Wuhan streets is gradually receding, many areas remain flooded. In Wuchang and Hanyang, there are 24,517 households and 116,453 disaster victims. In Hankou, there are 19,275 households and 96,461 disaster victims, totaling 212,000 disaster victims, of whom 23,000 cannot survive without relief. The number of people fleeing the floods from neighboring counties to Hankou is increasing daily, and the authorities are providing relief accordingly. (Special dispatch on the 22nd)</p>
<p>(Hankou) The General Disaster Relief Association has decided on the procedures for providing relief, prioritizing emergency relief, followed by agricultural relief, and then industrial relief. Emergency relief, including sheltering disaster victims, alone requires 3 to 4 million. Agricultural relief aims to address crop failures, and industrial relief prepares for dike breaches, requiring even greater funds. The province's self-raised funds, including provincial treasury expenditures, bank loans, and employee salary donations, total only 700,000 yuan. (Special dispatch on the 22nd)</p>
<p>(Hankou) The Wu-Hui Dike has become severely dangerous again after days of north wind erosion. On the 22nd, the headquarters dispatched a special commissioner to inspect the dike. Particular attention was paid to the six or seven "li" (Chinese unit of distance, approximately 0.5 kilometers) from Jiatang to Xiangjiawei, where the dike body has been severely damaged by waves. Although the entire section has been filled with hemp sacks, the old landslides have been completely destroyed, making the dike body even thinner. The public has been working for a long time, and replenishment is extremely difficult. If it encounters wind and rain again, the danger is unimaginable. After a long discussion on the dike with Yang Shisheng, the magistrate of Wuchang County, they could not find a suitable solution. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 22nd)</p>
<p>(Hankou) The "Chu Bao" newspaper's editorial today questions whether Hankou will face annual flood panic. It states that this year's widespread floods have caused huge losses, and future recurrences must be prevented. The newspaper suggests borrowing a large sum of money, using the dikes as collateral, so that the authorities can earnestly focus on flood prevention. It notes that the dike tax from Hankou to Yichang can generate approximately 1.75 million yuan annually, which can be used to offset a 6% bond loan of 25 million yuan. It also suggests that preventing floods requires more comprehensive arrangements, including large-scale dredging of the Yangtze River, following the procedures of the Dredging Bureau. (Reuters dispatch on the 22nd)</p>
<p>(Hankou) According to official estimates, the losses from the flood in Hubei Province are approximately 200 million yuan, with the losses in the Han River area alone being around 100 million yuan. The number of deaths is currently unknown. (Reuters dispatch on the 22nd)</p>
<p>(Hankou) Although the river water upstream in Chongqing and Yichang surged on the 21st, and there was heavy rain in the Hanzhong area of Shaanxi, the water level in the Hankou river area and Zhang Gong Dike area receded exceptionally quickly. On the 22nd, the Han River water level was 4.8 feet, and the Zhang Gong Dike water level was 51 feet. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 22nd)</p>
<h3 id="e2">The Mahua Dyke Collapsed, Causing Raging Waters; The Xunhou Lake Dyke is Under Strain <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>(Nanchang) A telegram from Xun reports that the Mahua Dyke has collapsed, causing raging waters, and the Houhu Lake Dyke is under strain. In addition, strong north winds have been blowing for two days, causing waves to erode the dike. The Jiangxi Water Conservancy Bureau has not only sent staff to take charge of protecting the sections of the Agong Dyke and Chu Gong Dyke along the river, but also prepared materials and sent more laborers to the Houhu Lake Dyke, making every effort to protect it. Furthermore, Poyang Lake is affected by the Yangtze River floods and is difficult to drain. As of now, it has only receded a little over three inches. The Binhu Nanxin Ji Yiwei area has not yet been rescued and is still being rescued. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 22nd)</p>
<p>(Nanchang) Xiong Shihui discussed disaster relief with the Provincial Relief Association on the 22nd and will begin to organize a disaster relief reserve fund management committee. The Provincial Relief Association has also established water disaster relief associations in Xingzi, Hukou, Jiujiang, Wu'ning, Ruichang, Yujiang, Yiyang, Shanggao, and Xiushui counties to provide emergency relief.

<h3 id="e3">High Water Level in the Southern Grand Canal <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>(Tianjin) The water level in the Southern Grand Canal is rising significantly. On the 20th, the water level had reached over eight feet. The embankments on both sides of the lower reaches are too low, and there is a risk of water overflowing onto the banks. Jiang Yankun, Director of the Southern Grand Canal Affairs Bureau, plans to go to supervise the emergency repairs on the 23rd. (Special dispatch on the 22nd)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The flood season has arrived. The Ziya River, Daqing River, Southern and Northern Grand Canal, and Yongding River all reported water level increases of approximately six inches as of the evening of the 22nd. The water level in the Yongding River is relatively stable. The highest water level in the Southern Grand Canal has reached 4.6 meters, posing a risk of flooding. The embankment in Dahuoxiang is incomplete, and there is concern that water will overflow from there. A group of employees from the River Bureau rushed to block and build it on the 22nd. (Special dispatch on the 22nd)</p>
<h3 id="e4">Xu Shiying Arrives in Changsha <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>(Changsha) Xu Shiying, accompanied by Huang, Hu, and Zhou, arrived in Hunan by special train at noon on the 22nd. He Jian and all department heads welcomed them at the station. Xu told reporters that he had received telegrams about the severity of the disaster in Hunan. After this inspection, he will report to the central government to seek relief. Fortunately, Hunan Province has relied on local self-help in the past when faced with repeated floods and droughts, and construction has progressed daily. In the future, it will be necessary to burden the local officials with their worries and plans. He personally traveled upstream to Hubei, where he was saddened by the devastation he witnessed. He did not have time to visit Jiangxi thoroughly but may go to Nanchang on his way back. He is also quite concerned about reports of the Yellow River overflowing and the severe disaster situation in Shandong and Henan. Xu then stayed at the provincial government guesthouse. In the afternoon, he discussed disaster relief plans with He at the provincial government and decided to depart on the morning of the 23rd to inspect the disaster in Yiyang, Hanshou, and Changde counties. He will depart on the 24th to return to Hankou and then to Jiangxi. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 22nd)</p>

<p>(Jinan) Today, Han Fuqu, according to the decisions made by Li Yizhi, Zheng Zhaojing, and others regarding the method of blocking the breach, telegraphed Lin, Wang, and Song, requesting one million in project funds to purchase materials for blocking. Today, Zheng Zhaojing, Li Yizhi, Puderli, Wan Hefo, and Wu Youxin went to Bian and decided to inspect the breach on the 23rd. Zhang Hanying, a representative from the Yellow River Commission, Zhang Guangyu, a representative from Henan, and Zhang Honglie, a representative from Shandong, went to Taochengpu today to inspect and accept the Golden Dike. They are scheduled to arrive in Puyang on the 23rd. (Special dispatch on the 22nd)</p>
<p>(Jinan) Today, Zhao Yusu, a technician from the Huai River Conservancy, and Zhou Yushan, an engineer from the Jiangsu Construction Department, returned to Xuzhou via Jinan after inspecting the breach. According to them, if the Yellow River rises significantly again, Jiangsu will inevitably suffer. Since the 21st, the main flow of the sixth breach has shifted to the northeast, endangering the civilian dikes and Juancheng. Today, the water flow in the Yellow River has generally increased. (Special dispatch on the 22nd)</p>
<p>(Zhenjiang) The Construction Department received a telegram from the Hanzhuang Water Station on the 21st stating that on the 21st, there was overcast and rainy weather in Hanzhuang, and the water level at Hukou was 31.63 meters, which was 8 centimeters lower than on the 20th. The water level in the Grand Canal was 31.67 meters, which was 7 centimeters lower. (Special dispatch on the 22nd)</p>

<p>(Beiping) The Yongding River water suddenly surged yesterday, reaching 10.5 feet. This morning, it had receded, with the water level at the Huilongmiao water gauge at 9.5 feet. By noon, it had receded to 9 feet. The River Affairs Bureau has instructed its various sections to pay close attention to prevent danger. (Special dispatch on the 22nd)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) A telegram from Baoding reported that Qi Shou'an, Director of the Hebei Yellow River Affairs Bureau, telegraphed the province on the 21st, stating that the Longmen River had risen by one meter. He ordered all counties to strengthen protection and requested that the magistrates of Dongming, Changyuan, and Puyang counties assign laborers to the dikes to assist.

<p>(Nanjing) Chu Minyi arrived in Nanjing from Qingdao on the morning of the 22nd. At 9:00 AM, he attended the Executive Yuan's memorial week and reported on President Wang's illness to all the staff of the Yuan. He said that when Wang transferred from Shanghai to Qingdao, he was in a special vehicle for transporting patients to the airport, which was very bumpy. It was the same when he arrived in Qingdao, which made him feel quite uncomfortable and his fever increased to almost 38 degrees Celsius. In addition, the doctor prescribed Carlsbader mineral water to clear the bile ducts, but he took it twice on consecutive days, and his liver hurt after each dose, proving that the gallbladder was still inflamed. After the doctor gave him injections and treatments and continued to apply hot compresses to his chest, his condition gradually improved. The doctor's blood test also showed a decrease in white blood cells, and his fever usually remained around 37.5 degrees Celsius. However, according to Noel, based on his condition when he left Shanghai, he could have hoped to fully recover after four weeks of recuperation in Qingdao. Now, because the gallbladder has not yet subsided, the medical treatment will need to be extended slightly, perhaps for another two weeks, before he can recover. Furthermore, Wang's trip to Qingdao was solely for the purpose of recuperating and recovering as soon as possible. During the recuperation period, the doctor strongly advised him not to see any guests. Therefore, since arriving in Qingdao, he has not received a single guest, but he instructed me to thank those who came to welcome him at the airport and those who came to the residence to express their sympathy.

<h3 id="e26">Re-discussing British-Japanese Relations <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>— Ang</p>
<p>The other day, I discussed the conflict of interests between Britain and Japan in East Asia. In recent days, there have been two more events that can be used for reference. (1) Japan and Manchukuo signed an agreement on the 15th of this month in Changchun to establish a joint economic committee to "seek the permanent strengthening of economic relations between the two countries and the realization of the rational integration of the two countries' economies." This is another step in the East Asian Group Movement. (2) The Manchester Chamber of Commerce's textile, chemical, and machinery industries submitted a report on trade with China to the British Department of Commerce on the 17th of this month, confirming Japan's aggressive policies and commercial competition, making it necessary for Britain's laissez-faire policy in the Far East in recent years to be replaced by active action. This is another indication of the threat felt by the British side. The above two events are sharply opposed to each other. The seriousness of the economic conflict between the two countries can also be seen here.</p>
<p>Britain and Japan have such profound contradictions, but diplomacy is still hypocritical. Hirota's diplomacy has repeatedly used the word "cooperation" as its banner. The new British Foreign Secretary Hoare recently stated that in addition to maintaining Britain's Far Eastern interests, he is also willing to cooperate with Japan. This diplomatic state between the two countries is also worthy of consideration. First, let us talk about the essence of Hoare's political thought. When Baldwin reorganized the British cabinet, Hoare, as the Minister of Indian Affairs, succeeded Simon as Foreign Secretary. Eden was appointed as a minister without portfolio, specializing in League of Nations affairs. Hoare is a new figure in British diplomacy. His rise can be seen as a symbol of the British government's change of diplomatic policy, especially in its relations with the United States and Asia. According to our observation, Hoare's words and deeds since taking office as Foreign Secretary best represent the new British conservatism. In short, this doctrine is to seek the active development of its own interests in international compromise.</p>
<p>Last month, when the Japanese Ambassador to the United Kingdom, Matsudaira, left office and returned to his country, Hoare said a few words, roughly saying, "British-Japanese relations have recently had some factors of friction. Recent events in North China can be used to illustrate the rest. As the world's two major industrial countries, competition between industry and commerce is inevitable." He also said, "We in Britain believe that proper understanding and cooperation between the two countries is not only an element of Asian tranquility but also the key to world prosperity." From this perspective, Hoare seems to be still unable to forget British-Japanese cooperation, which is equally divided.</p>
<p>However, since the failure of the London Economic Conference, the attempt to seek world prosperity through international cooperation has become a dream that is hoped for but cannot be realized. Between Britain and Japan, since the abolition of the Indo-Japanese Commercial Treaty last year and the breakdown of the Simla Trade Conference, experts have long said that there is no room for reconciliation. Recently, the British government has repeatedly sought cooperation from the Japanese government in its move to send its chief economic advisor, Leith-Ross, to China, but Japanese Vice Foreign Minister Shigemitsu Kui has consistently refused, further proving that cooperation between the two countries is impossible. Then, are the so-called cooperation and collaboration in the diplomatic rhetoric of the two countries only to cover up the mutual hostility?</p>
<h3 id="e27">Italian-Ethiopian Dispute Enters a Serious Phase; British Ambassador Meets with Italian Prime Minister in Hopes of Salvage; Four-Point Plan Struggles to Satisfy Italian Desires; France Caught in a Dilemma, Unwilling to Abandon Old Friendship for New Acquaintance; Japan's Fickle Attitude Faces Attack from Italian Newspapers <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>(Rome) Sir Eric Drummond, the first Secretary-General of the League of Nations and current British Ambassador to Italy, plans to meet with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini today in a final effort to avert an Italian-Ethiopian war. However, Sir Drummond also stated that the Ethiopian Emperor's inflammatory speech has closed the door to a peaceful resolution. Nevertheless, diplomatic talks are continuing in a subdued atmosphere, while Mussolini continues to order the steamship "Arabia" to transport troops, supplies, and 580 mules to Africa, and has announced that, as of June 30th, Italy's military expenditure for the conquest of Africa has reached US$107,500,000. The plan proposed by Sir Drummond and the French Ambassador to Italy, Mr. Chambrun, to Mussolini includes the following four points: (1) Cession of Ethiopian border territory; (2) Italy to enjoy economic privileges in Ethiopia; (3) Italy to be allowed to build a railway through Ethiopian territory, connecting Eritrea and Italian Somaliland; (4) The Ethiopian government to employ Italian advisors, similar to Egypt's employment of British advisors. However, according to today's Italian newspaper editorials, one can clearly see Italy's attitude towards this kind of diplomatic negotiation. One newspaper stated that one thing has been determined in the dispute between Italy and Ethiopia, that is, the League of Nations has no right to interfere. (21st National Telegram)</p>
<p>(Also from Paris) French newspapers unanimously report that the Italian-Ethiopian dispute has entered a serious phase since the Ethiopian Emperor's recent passionate address to Parliament. A special dispatch from Rome in the "Petit Parisien" states that the severance of diplomatic relations between the two countries is not far off, but this does not necessarily mean that war will be declared or fighting will occur immediately. The "Paris Echo" believes that Japan's attitude of positioning itself as the protector of people of color is worthy of attention. Britain, having vast colonies in both Asia and Africa, is determined not to give them up easily. As this matter develops, Italy increasingly desires to strengthen its relations with France, as France is the only country that holds a pro-Italian attitude towards the Italian-Ethiopian conflict. However, Italy is not satisfied with France's neutrality and is now demanding further action from France. However, France itself is currently facing difficulties and, unless foolish, is unwilling to sacrifice its friendship with Britain for a new acquaintance like Italy. Mr. Bastié, Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Chamber of Deputies, published an article in the "République" stating that Italy now wishes to rise above international organizations, an attitude that is tantamount to denying the existence or the right to self-determination of other countries, and will therefore endanger the entire concept of international order.

<p>(London) Cabinet members held a meeting this morning, generally believed to be discussing the Abyssinian issue. (22nd Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>(London) According to the "Daily Telegraph," although some have argued that the Council of the League of Nations should seek to delay its meeting, London does not favor this. The crisis of an Italian-Ethiopian war is imminent, and to maintain peace, no further delay is appropriate. Therefore, the Council of the League of Nations should not postpone its meeting and waste this limited time. The report also stated, "What policy Britain will adopt is now being watched by all countries in the world. The United States government has requested to be notified at any time of Britain's attitude towards the Italian-Ethiopian dispute. As for the Soviet Union, it will not make any judgments on the Italian-Ethiopian dispute until Britain's policy is determined." The "Times" published a dispatch from its correspondent in Rome, which stated, "Last night, Italian newspapers published news that a conference of Britain, France, and Italy would be held in Rome in the shortest possible time. Italian officials have not heard of this. The news is technically correct because Britain, France, and Italy have not proposed holding what is normally called a 'conference.' However, according to the 1906 Three-Power Treaty on Abyssinia, any of the three countries (Britain, France, Italy) taking action regarding Abyssinia should consult with the other two countries beforehand. The Italian government can hardly refuse this kind of consultation. If Italian Prime Minister Mussolini holds consultations with the British and French Ambassadors to Italy in Rome, then, in all senses, although it is not a conference, it is no different from convening a three-nation conference. However, so far, the British and French governments have not instructed their ambassadors to Italy to hold consultations with the Italian Prime Minister. Therefore, the Abyssinian issue is currently in a stalemate, and the future is extremely chaotic. Everything is difficult to predict. The current rainy season in Abyssinia, which prevents military movement, is also one of the reasons for the chaotic situation." (22nd Havas Telegram)</p>

<p>(London) The newly appointed Ethiopian Minister to Britain, Mr. Martin, recently gave an interview to a reporter from the "Daily Express," stating, "My purpose in coming to Britain is to obtain a loan. The Ethiopian government is in dire need of funds, not only to cope with the war but also to develop domestic mineral resources and other economic benefits. Ethiopia has extremely rich mineral reserves, and we are prepared to develop them." He also stated that if negotiations with British financial groups unfortunately fail, they plan to contact American capitalist Mr. Morgan, who is currently in Britain, to explore the possibility of obtaining loans from the United States. According to Martin, in addition to financial matters, his mission to Britain has two other purposes: one is to lobby the British government to support Ethiopia in the Italian-Ethiopian dispute and to work within the League of Nations to impose sanctions on Italy, such as blockading the Suez Canal to prevent Italian troops from passing through; the other is to request the British government to lift the embargo on arms to Ethiopia. Martin also detailed the Ethiopian military preparations in the interview, saying that they have stockpiled a large number of weapons and ammunition, such as machine guns, Lewis rifles, long-range field artillery, and anti-aircraft guns.

<p>(Paris) According to a statement by a former Italian Minister of Colonies, Italy's attitude towards the Italian-Ethiopian dispute can be summarized as follows: Italy does not value a resolution to this matter unless any resolution guarantees Italy two things: (1) "Security," not only guaranteeing the security of the Italian border but also gaining unlimited control over the Ethiopian military; (2) "Expansion," allowing Italy to colonize Ethiopia as France did with Morocco and Britain with Iraq, thereby civilizing Ethiopia. Italy is willing to resolve this matter peacefully, but it does not fear war and will not compromise on the resolution. Italy feels disappointed by the Treaty of Versailles and is now working to correct past mistakes. (22nd National Telegram)</p>

Therefore, the severance of diplomatic relations between the two countries is becoming increasingly imminent. (22nd National Telegram)</p>
<h3 id="e32">Detention of Prince Zema: Italy Uses it as a Pretext for Criticism; Ethiopian Government Responds to This <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>(London) Italian newspapers recently accused the Ethiopian Emperor of detaining the Prince of the Kingdom of Zema, intending to annex the country. Regarding this matter, the "Daily Telegraph" recently received a telegram from Addis Ababa, stating, "The Ethiopian government has responded to this accusation from Italy, mainly stating that it is true that the late King Abba Jiffar of Zema had designated his grandson Abba Shia as his successor. However, the Ethiopian Emperor revoked his right of succession because Abba Shia was incompetent, and he was also detained for participating in slave trafficking. Now, while foreigners oppose the slave system on the one hand, they defend the right to inherit the throne of slave traders on the other hand. The Ethiopian government is deeply surprised by this. The Kingdom of Zema was originally a stronghold of the slave system, and the Ethiopian government intends to reform it. Therefore, it directly exercises administrative power there to achieve effective reform. However, the so-called direct exercise of administrative power is completely different in nature from annexation. Outsiders cannot selectively quote it as a pretext for criticizing Ethiopia."

<h3 id="e33">Japan's Fickle Actions: Italian Newspapers Unanimously Attack, Saying that Invoking the Kellogg-Briand Pact is Especially Disgusting <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>(Rome) Italian newspapers are now reacting strongly to Japan's attitude towards Ethiopia. The newspapers accuse Japan of trying to expand its commercial influence in East Africa, thereby harming Italy's interests. (22nd Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Rome) Italian newspapers unanimously attack Japanese Foreign Minister Hirota's statement regarding the Italian-Ethiopian dispute, considering the Japanese government to be fickle and unprecedented. The "Messaggero" attacks Japan especially fiercely, stating, "Japanese Ambassador to Italy, Mr. Sugimura, just made a declaration, saying that Japan should remain neutral in the Italian-Ethiopian dispute, but before the ink was dry, he reversed himself, which is truly shocking. However, once the relationship between Japan and Italy is considered, it is not surprising at all. The Japanese government's sudden change of attitude is actually due to Japan's long-standing policy of hostility towards Italy. As for Japanese Ambassador Sugimura's visit to Mussolini, declaring neutrality in the Italian-Ethiopian dispute, it was actually due to accepting instructions from the Japanese government to deceive the Italian government (the motive for the deception is unknown). Unexpectedly, Sugimura took it seriously, and Foreign Minister Hirota had to deny it. In short, the reason why Japan is so concerned about the future of Ethiopia is due to two motives: one is due to commercial relations, and the other is due to racial relations. In terms of racial motives, its nature is very serious. All those who cherish the dignity of the white race must pay attention to it. We still remember that a spokesman for the Japanese government once declared that 'If Japan can sympathize with Ethiopia, it will be enough to increase Japan's commercial authority and political prestige among the black people in Africa and the Asian nations.' Moreover, for fifty years, Japanese politicians have repeatedly regarded the white race as Japan's enemy, so Japan's support for Ethiopia is indeed due to racial motives. As for Japan's proposal to invoke the Kellogg-Briand Pact to resolve the Italian-Ethiopian dispute, it is especially disgusting because Japan is now invading Chinese territory, and Chinese culture is more ancient and excellent than Japan's. Now that Japan is occupying China, shouldn't Italy be allowed to punish the barbaric Ethiopia?" "Il Piccolo" stated, "Japan's interference in the Italian-Ethiopian dispute is bizarre and misguided. However, in any case, Italy's position is very clear and firm. Japan's attitude, on the contrary, is enough to show the legitimacy of Mussolini's actions to Western countries and make people feel that action to protect European culture is, in fact, imperative."

<p>Munich: A grand ceremony was held today in front of the War Museum. A delegation of British war veterans visited the European War Memorial and paid tribute to the Munich soldiers who died in the European War. German war veterans' groups, carrying wartime banners, stood in formation around the memorial. The British delegation then inspected the various ranks of war veterans and shook hands with the seriously wounded to show respect. The British representatives also declared that today's respect for yesterday's enemies is not accidental; it is indeed admiration for the enemy's bravery. A miracle that could not be believed a few years ago will now become a thing of the past. Enemies who fought each other yesterday now stand shoulder to shoulder, without any animosity, paying tribute to the soldiers who died in the European War to commemorate them. After the ceremony, the British delegation went to the headquarters of the Nazi Party to listen to the history of the Nazi Party's past struggles. Afterwards, they attended a reception hosted by the Mayor of Munich, where they were warmly welcomed by the Mayor. After the banquet, the British delegation split into groups to tour.

<p>(Paris) The British war veterans' delegation went from Berlin to Munich yesterday to visit the "Brown House," the birthplace of the Nazi Party. Someone asked them to lay a wreath in front of the monument to the Nazi Party members who died in the November 29, 1923 coup. The British delegation refused to do so because they believed that this act had political implications. The "Paris Echo" recently published a telegram from its correspondent in London, stating that the British delegation, after this provocation, will inevitably return disappointed after going in with high spirits. The British war veterans' delegation went to Munich at the invitation of the German side, and the German side did not inform them of the purpose of the visit beforehand. When they arrived there, they were asked to lay a wreath in front of the monument to the Nazi Party members. The British delegation believed that this kind of expression had political implications and was inconvenient to participate in, so they politely declined. Although the Nazi Party authorities were rejected, they kept it secret until the scheduled time, when the crowd gathered in front of the monument. The German war veterans temporarily placed a wreath there as a cover. Therefore, the general public still thought that it was a wreath laid by the British. Even the German newspapers misrepresented the facts and believed it to be true. (21st Havas Telegram)</p>

<p>(Berlin) The conflict between the German Nazi Party and the Catholic Church is now becoming increasingly acute. Catholic priests have openly resisted General Goering's order to crack down on political Catholicism. Yesterday, hundreds of priests, disregarding the danger of being imprisoned, read essays from the Vatican newspaper on the church platform, condemning the Nazi Party's destruction of the treaty between Germany and the Vatican. This essay defended the Catholic youth movement and the Catholic labor organization, and criticized the destruction of reproductive function and Interior Minister Frick's statement that German Catholics must abide by national laws, even laws that are against religion and morality. Yesterday, secret detectives were deployed in Berlin churches, but the Nazi Party authorities have not yet decided on a way to arrest the priests on a large scale. The Nazi Party apparently attacks both German Jews and Catholics in unison, without distinction. General Goering's order to crack down on political Catholicism has been promulgated nationwide. The Minister of Education has reissued an instruction stating that this order must be implemented, regardless of who they are or the position of the church. At the same time, the court has been instructed to severely punish dangerous elements that could harm the country and the people. The "Münchner Neueste Nachrichten" reported from Berlin that the Nazi Party's anti-religious plan and the plan to disband the Stahlhelm are progressing simultaneously. The Nazi Party considers the Stahlhelm to be a conservative restorationist organization with no anti-Semitic nature. Furthermore, the public is gradually feeling the impact of Germany's economic difficulties and the loss of foreign trade. The Nazi Party's actions against Jews and religion and its crackdown on the Stahlhelm are probably also intended to divert public attention. (22nd Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>Brussels: According to news obtained by the "Nation Belge" on the Belgian-German border, a wave of anti-Nazi sentiment has recently occurred in Aachen, a city in western Germany, and the situation is very tense. Aachen has always been a Catholic stronghold, and the Catholics have always lacked goodwill towards the Nazi Party. Recently, several nuns were arrested for smuggling money. At the same time, a certain professor was also arrested on suspicion of being an accomplice. This has aroused resentment from the Catholic Church, and the entire city is extremely uneasy. The Nazi Party authorities are deeply afraid of accidents and have strictly defended the barracks of the Party Army. (21st Havas Telegram)</p>

<p>(Berlin) Members of the Nazi Party's assault troops clashed with Jews on Kurfürstendamm here several times last week, but today the situation there is no longer turbulent, and the situation is slightly more stable. Jewish customers are no longer seen in front of cafes, and the "assault troop groups" against Jews no longer march in teams to demonstrate. There are also no more slogans on the street saying "Jews insult the German race." However, anti-Semitic disturbances continue to occur in the area around Bavariaplatz. Nazi Party members wrote in large letters in front of the shops opened by Jews there, "I am a Jew. German people who come here to buy will be in danger." In addition, a Swedish film called "Pettersson und Bendel," whose content is based on the anti-Semitic movement, is considered by the Propaganda Department to have "political value" and has been authorized to be shown in various places tax-free. The film has recently been reprinted in multiple copies and sent to various places for screening. It is also reported here that the anti-Semitic movement is very active in the provinces. For example, in Trieste, Jewish shops are limited to closing at 5:00 PM every day. Crowds march in teams, shouting "Jews, die quickly" or "German women, don't have relations with pigs (referring to Jews)." The names of all women who have been with Jews are disclosed in the newspapers. Some public places also have signs hanging at the entrance saying "Dogs and Jews are not allowed in."

<p>(London) According to news reported by the "Daily Telegraph," a riot suddenly occurred in Lahore, India, yesterday. At that time, ten people were killed and 74 people were injured, including five British police officers. The situation of this rebellion is the most serious in years. Although the military and police tried their best to suppress it after the incident last night, the rebellion is still rampant, and the entire city has suddenly become uneasy. Furthermore, the Muslim people of Amritsar in Punjab are on strike to express their sympathy for the rebellion. A large number of soldiers and police were deployed to suppress it, so there was no tragedy of bloodshed. (22nd Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>Lahore: Yesterday, Muslims attacked the military and police, causing great disturbance. The situation is still serious today, so more British troops were deployed in the afternoon to suppress them. The troops placed barbed wire nets in the streets to prevent the Muslims from attacking. However, the Muslims still did not disperse at night. This morning, the number of people suddenly increased by several thousand, and the momentum was fierce. They threw bricks and stones at the soldiers. The authorities' warning was ineffective. At noon, the soldiers fired six shots, but the Muslims still resisted the soldiers and threw stones at them again. The British soldiers then fired live ammunition again, killing about two people. The demonstrators' arrogance was slightly reduced, but their attitude is still strong. The Lahore Light Cavalry of Punjab was also deployed to assist, and the Sixth Lancers and the Sixth Armored Car Regiment were ordered to station in the park to prevent accidents. British troops are now stationed in all important places in Lahore, and armored vehicles travel back and forth on the main thoroughfares. It is reported that a total of 16 people have died in the riots, and the number of injured is quite large. (21st Reuters Telegram)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) The Egyptian government's abrogation of the trade treaty with Japan is actually orchestrated by Britain. This oppressive policy adopted by Britain was decided after the breakdown of the Anglo-Japanese private cotton industry cooperative. Moreover, its instigation is not limited to Egypt. "Palestine," nearby "Transjordan," and "Iraq," which is under British control, are all being influenced by British merchants through the power of the aforementioned governments. Britain is also encouraging British Imperial markets and those in Central and South America to prevent the import of Japanese goods. In the current state of affairs, it is impossible for Japanese cotton products to develop new markets. Even maintaining the current situation will become impossible. To protect the existing market for cotton products and to attempt reasonable development, the idea of reopening the Anglo-Japanese private sector conference has recently resurfaced.

<p>Ottawa: After the report that the Japanese government is launching a trade protection law reached here, Canada's government and public are quite shocked. In particular, the western regions such as British Columbia, which are directly affected, are advocating retaliatory measures against Japan. (Twentieth Dispatch from the Japanese Allied Press)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) It is reported that Canada is considering levying an additional tax of one-third ad valorem or abrogating the trade treaty based on the provisions of the tariff law in response to Japan's launch of the Trade Protection Act. The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs is also studying countermeasures with a cautious attitude. However, if Canada adopts a challenging attitude, Japan is determined to fight a tariff war. If Canada raises tariffs, Japan will increase the current 50% additional tax to 100% or add other goods in accordance with the provisions of the Trade Protection Act to counterattack. If Canada abrogates the trade treaty and treats Japanese goods in a discriminatory manner, Japan will also impose discriminatory tariffs on Canadian goods and adopt a policy of prohibiting Canadian goods from entering the country. However, in terms of Japan-Canada trade tariffs, Japan's exports to Canada in the past year were only 8.66 million yuan, while Canada's exports to Japan reached 54 million yuan. Therefore, the impact on the Canadian side is greater than that on the Japanese side. It is expected that the Canadian side will not abrogate the trade treaty and will continue diplomatic negotiations. The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs knows that Canada's strong demands will be difficult to sustain. Therefore, it is determined to persist in a tough confrontation to prompt Canada to reflect. (Twenty-second Dispatch from the Electric Communication Society)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) It is reported that the United States will adopt import restrictions on Japanese cotton products. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has the following views on this intention: It is true that American textile manufacturers are advocating raising tariffs or implementing restrictions to prevent the import of Japanese cotton cloth. Regarding this matter, Ambassador Saito has repeatedly visited Secretary Hull to request understanding. Although the United States pointed out that Japanese cotton cloth is flooding the entire American market and that imports of Japanese cotton cloth account for 17% of the total, the United States should also consider the large amount of American cotton imported into Japan and the great benefit to the American agricultural community. This time, the movement is a compromise proposal because Japan has withdrawn the increase in the processing tax on rayon products from the Lyon region. It is also unknown whether it will take the form of import restrictions or become a matter for Congress. However, as no official telegram has been received, it is impossible to express an attitude.

<p>(Tokyo) The Kailuan Coal Mines, the center of British power in North China, have been affected by pressure from the Fushun Coal Mine and the Xishan Coal Mine, as well as the economic downturn. Last year, the coal mine and its associated businesses suffered losses of approximately 400,000 yuan. Furthermore, Britain is considering the expansion of Japanese power along the Beining Line and that it will be more difficult to revive the business in the future. Therefore, Japanese newspapers reported that Britain intends to transfer the rights and interests of the Kailuan Coal Mines and its affiliated businesses to Japan, making it a joint venture between China, Britain, and Japan. Changben, wanting to develop the North China economy, intends to take control of the port of Qinhuangdao, so it is also very eager to operate the mines.</p>
<p>Note: The Kailuan Coal Mines are located in the area of ​​Tangshan Guye Station along the Beining Railway, eleven kilometers north and south, including the coal mines of Tangshan, Xishan, Linxi, Majiagou, Zhaogezhuang, Yinzikou, Langweigou, Chenjialing, and Taoyuan. The average coal seam is thirteen to thirty-four meters thick, and the deepest reaches seventy-six meters. The reserves are approximately 325 million tons. The coal quality is bituminous coal. In the years before and after the September 18th Incident, the annual production was 3 million to 4.5 million tons. If estimated based on the previous production standards, it can still be mined for a hundred years. (Twenty-second Dispatch from the China United News Agency)</p>

Article 3 of the treaty stipulates that the Chinese government may station consuls in Hanoi or Haiphong and Saigon in Vietnam. It is reported that our government intends to establish consulates in Vietnam to protect the interests of overseas Chinese. The location of the future consulates will be in Saigon and Hanoi, but it is still under consideration. (Twenty-second Dispatch from the Central News Agency)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Special Treaty on Relations between Vietnam and the Border Provinces of China and its appendices, which have been recently agreed upon by China and France, were announced and implemented by both parties on the 22nd and have been reported in various newspapers. According to a diplomatic expert familiar with the process of this negotiation, the main treaty of the Special Treaty on Relations between Vietnam and the Border Provinces of China was signed by former Foreign Minister Wang Zhengting and former French Ambassador Martell on May 16, 1930. Subsequently, work began on discussing Tables A and B contained in the first annex to the treaty. Table A contains more than 30 kinds of important goods from the southwestern border provinces of China, which, when transported from Yunnan, Guangxi, and Guangdong to Vietnam, can be taxed at the lowest tariff rate. Table B contains goods from French Vietnam that, when transported to the above three provinces, can be taxed in accordance with China's tariffs at the time. Initially, the French proposal reportedly also included dozens of items. After several disputes, the French side finally agreed to reduce it to six taxable items and agreed to use the tariffs at the time of the formal signing of the goods table as the standard. However, it insisted that the item of white coal produced in Vietnam in Table B should be taxed according to the previous tax rate and stated that if this issue could not be resolved, the negotiations would be impossible to proceed. The government did not agree to the request because the coal tax had already been increased at that time. After repeated consultations, the negotiations were on the verge of breaking down. In 1933, the government considered that the completion of the Vietnamese treaty was related to the entire Sino-Vietnamese commerce and the interests of overseas Chinese in Vietnam. It had no choice but to make slight concessions. It reached an agreement with the French side that within the validity period of this special treaty, the import of Vietnamese white coal could be taxed according to the 1932 tax rate, and an exchange of documents was immediately made to clearly define Vietnamese white coal, so that only the components of Vietnamese anthracite white coal would match it, in order to show restrictions. The issue of the Vietnamese coal import tax was thus resolved. At that time, China was collecting rice tax and increasing the tax rate. The French side then requested the unification of the rice tax and the reduction of the tax amount because of the large amount of Vietnamese rice imported. The signing of the two appendices, A and B, went through another twist. Afterwards, after repeated consultations, the government, always for the sake of the entire Sino-Vietnamese commercial relationship and the maintenance of the interests of overseas Chinese in Vietnam, again agreed to the French side's determination of a tax amount that was not much different from the current tax rate, and only for a period of two years. The rice tax issue was also brought to a close. Thus, all the points of contention on both sides were resolved. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the French Ambassador Weili signed the protocol on the conclusion of the two appendices A and B and other annexes on May 4 of this year. The written records of the entire treaty and its annexes were signed and exchanged instruments of ratification by our Acting Charge d'Affaires in France Xiao Jirong and representatives of the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Paris on July 20. The treaty was announced and implemented on the 22nd. The Vietnamese treaty, which had been desired by the government and the public for many years, was thus completed. According to the provisions of the treaty and its annexes, the most important benefits obtained by China are the following: (1) The more than 30 kinds of Chinese goods listed in the above-mentioned Table A, when transported from China to Vietnam, can be taxed at the lowest tax rate; (2) A large number of overseas Chinese reside in Vietnam, and they have suffered greatly because no consulates have been established. After the implementation of the new treaty, China can station consuls in Saigon and Hanoi or Haiphong to protect overseas Chinese; (3) The Vietnamese government has often discriminated against overseas Chinese and treated them harshly, especially in matters such as entry and relocation. After the implementation of the new treaty, overseas Chinese will enjoy most-favored-nation treatment when entering and leaving Vietnam and traveling in the interior. They will also be treated the same as most-favored-nation nationals in terms of paying various taxes; (4) Various privileges historically enjoyed by overseas Chinese, such as land rights, navigation rights, and fishing rights, can be more clearly guaranteed after the implementation of the new treaty, so that they will not be deprived at any time; (5) The transit tax levied on Chinese goods passing through Vietnam has in fact been levied up to 20%. After the implementation of the new treaty, the transit tax can be reduced or exempted separately, and the increase in Chinese goods exported to Vietnam and the prosperity of commerce in Yunnan, Guangxi, and Guangdong are all the more a matter of course.

<p>(Paris) Xiao Jirong, Counselor of our Embassy in France, went to the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the morning of the 20th at 11:00 to sign the Vietnamese treaty and exchange records (Process Verbal) and received the original treaty. The French side was approved by Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs Laval. Both sides will announce it on the 22nd of this month, and it will take effect immediately.

<p>(Nanjing) After the closure of the Yangzi Flour Company, the results of consultations between various agencies on the 22nd were that since the company was closed due to financial losses and inability to support itself, there are in fact no funds available to resume operations. Representatives of various agencies held a small group meeting before the talks to determine a reasonable compromise solution. According to the labor side's demands, all workers must be paid one and a half years' wages. The factory side only agreed to give one month's wages in accordance with the provisions of the Factory Law. The representatives, considering the difficulties of both labor and management, determined a comprehensive solution. The main points are: 1. All workers will be paid two and a half months' wages; 2. The factory will issue certificates of employment, and they will have priority in employment when operations resume; 3. The 6,000 bags of flour stored in the factory when the Datong Flour Mill leased the factory will be allowed to be released and taken back by Datong itself. Representatives of the party and government agencies will go to the factory this afternoon to announce this plan and set a deadline of 10:00 a.m. on the 23rd to receive replies from both parties in order to sign the agreement and implement it. It is reported that the company's debts are about 1 million yuan, with the China Industrial Bank being the largest creditor. Several companies such as Zhejiang Xingye Salt Industry National Goods Shanghai and others are temporary commodity mortgage loans with small amounts. As for the machinery and other equipment, they were mortgaged to the China Industrial Bank long ago. As far as the hope of resuming operations is concerned, Yangzi itself has no way to do so.

<h3 id="e54">Customs Administration Expenses to be Paid in Three Parts <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Wu Jing, Chief of the Customs Administration Section of the Ministry of Finance, reported that the expenditure of the Customs Administration is divided into three parts: (1) the Customs Service, (2) the Customs Superintendent, and (3) the Customs School. (1) The original budget for the Customs Service for the 24th year was 34 million yuan (including anti-smuggling expenses). The Central Political Committee reviewed it and first reduced it to 32 million yuan, and then reduced it to 30 million yuan, a sudden reduction of 4 million yuan, which is quite insufficient. It is now striving to tighten expenses to adapt to the situation. According to the customs expenses of various countries, the ratio of customs expenses to tax revenue is between 1% and 10%. China's current customs revenue is about 30 million yuan per year. Increasing the anti-smuggling effectiveness will minimize tax evasion, while reducing the anti-smuggling effectiveness will expand the scope of tax evasion. It is also unknown whether the result of reducing expenditure will be penny-wise and pound-foolish. (2) There are a total of 28 Customs Superintendent offices nationwide. The budget for the 24th year is 670,000 yuan, which the Central Political Committee reviewed and reduced to 570,000 yuan, which is very tight. It was originally prepared to abolish the inland transit customs, but now, because the abolition of transit and exemption of export taxes cannot be implemented for a while, it has been decided to start with a general reduction in expenditure. The current monthly expenses of each customs post are 3,000 yuan for those with more expenses and 1,000 yuan for those with fewer expenses. (3) The Customs School, including the Beiping Main School and the Shanghai Branch School, has achieved excellent results in the past. Most of those who now serve in the Customs Service are graduates of the school. Due to the overcrowding of customs personnel, graduates cannot be placed, coupled with financial constraints, it has been decided to suspend the Beiping Main School from this semester and merge it into the Shanghai Branch School, saving 50,000 yuan per year, which has been approved by the Minister.

<p>Tightening Expenses to Balance Revenue and Expenditure is Hoped For, 120,000 Troops Have Been Disbanded</p>
<p>Nanjing Correspondence: Liu Hangchen, Director of the Sichuan Finance Department, and Guan Jiyu, Special Finance Commissioner, flew to Nanjing yesterday to request detailed methods for reorganizing Sichuan finance from the Ministry of Finance. This reporter visited Mr. Liu and had a long conversation of one hour, discussing the financial situation and troop reduction in Sichuan in detail. The following is a record (what follows is Mr. Liu's talk):</p>
<p>Regarding Sichuan's financial situation, first, on the expenditure side, it can be roughly divided into four items: The regular expenses of the original troops were about 60 million yuan per year, the bandit suppression expenses were about 18 million yuan, the debt repayment fund was 12.2 million yuan, and the administrative expenses were 11 million yuan, totaling over 100 million yuan. Now, after reorganizing the remaining troops, tightening expenditures, and with the Military Affairs Commission bearing the bandit suppression expenses, the expenditure figures are: regular troop expenses of about 40 million yuan per year, a debt repayment fund of 12.2 million yuan, and administrative expenses of 11 million yuan, totaling about 63.3 million yuan. Second, on the revenue side, the original revenue figures were: salt tax (including surcharges) of about 15 million yuan per year, land tax of over 7.5 million yuan, special military levies of over 22.7 million yuan, special taxes of 12 million yuan, local taxes of 15 million yuan, stamp, tobacco, and alcohol taxes of over 3 million yuan, miscellaneous taxes of 4.3 million yuan, and slaughter tax of 1.8 million yuan, totaling about 81 million yuan. Due to the bandit disturbances in the north and south, revenue has sharply decreased. The current revenue figures are: salt tax (including surcharges) of about 10.3 million yuan per year, land tax of over 6.9 million yuan, special military levies of over 20.7 million yuan, special taxes of over 9 million yuan, local taxes of over 12 million yuan, stamp, tobacco, and alcohol taxes of over 3 million yuan, miscellaneous taxes of 4.3 million yuan, and slaughter tax of 1.8 million yuan, totaling about 68 million yuan. However, as the authorities are striving to reduce expenditures, and with all expenses being tightened, it can still be managed. This is the general situation of Sichuan's financial revenue and expenditure.</p>
<p>Striving to Save Expenditures: When I (Mr. Liu referring to himself) returned to Sichuan, the monthly military expenses of the troops directly under the command of Liu FuCheng, the Sichuan Rehabilitation Supervisor, had reached over 2.94 million yuan. At that time, Supervisor Liu immediately and voluntarily reduced the number of officers and soldiers by about 30,000, reducing the military expenses to over 2.4 million yuan. After February, it was voluntarily reduced again to over 2.1 million yuan. After the various armies handed over their defense zones in March, including the military expenses of each army, it totaled over 3.7 million yuan. Adding clothing and other miscellaneous expenses, the total regular expenses of the various units were about 4.2 million yuan per month. The total amount of military agencies and military supplementary expenses was 783,000 yuan per month. Combined, the annual regular expenses were about 60 million yuan.</p>
<p>Sichuan Army Limited to Reorganization: Today, Sichuan's finances have the hope of balancing revenue and expenditure, the key to which lies entirely in troop reduction. Therefore, on June 30th, Chairman Chiang issued the "30 Secret Chengdu Telegram" ordering a reduction of one-third, to be completed before July 15th. Before I came east this time, according to news from all sides, the expenses reduced by the reorganization have reached 15 million yuan per year. Supervisor Liu also flew to Chongqing on the 18th of this month to make every effort to tighten military agencies and military supplementary expenses. The limit set by the Chairman's telegram can be easily achieved in the shortest possible time.</p>
<p>Finances After Reorganization: After this reorganization, Sichuan's finances will have a surplus, which will be used in the first step to repay the debts incurred by the provincial government when it took over the defense zones in the shortest possible time, as well as future revenue from sources such as house rent and business tax. The second step will be to transfer the remaining funds to construction expenses. The expenses for this reorganization will only amount to 1.4 million yuan, as stipulated by Chairman Chiang. Even if there is an increase in the future, the amount will be limited. This is all due to the thorough understanding of the military commanders, so they were able to reorganize over 120,000 troops in the shortest period of 15 days and with the least expense of 1.4 million yuan. It is only with the determination of Chairman Chiang that this achievement could be reached, even with the most intense bandit suppression going on in the front lines.</p>
<p>Coming to Nanjing to Request Instructions on Reorganization Methods: The Chairman has already ordered the implementation of the reorganization. In terms of reducing expenditures, we have succeeded. This time, I was ordered to come east to request detailed methods for reorganizing finances from the Ministry of Finance in order to follow them. I have decided to go to Shanghai tonight and will return to Sichuan in a week. How the final measures will be determined, I will inform you again later. Today, rural bankruptcy and reducing the burden on the people are the unanimous demands of the entire country. In handling Sichuan's finances, I should also do my best in this regard. Everything under the provincial government has already been reduced, and everything under the provincial government is currently being investigated and reported by the counties according to the methods promulgated by the Military Affairs Commission. Over 90 counties have already submitted reports, accounting for about two-thirds of the province. When I return to Sichuan, I will do my best to start reorganizing county and city local finances. As for the bandit suppression situation, it has been recorded in various newspapers. Recently, important locations such as Tumen and Diexi have been successively recovered, and the bandit areas have been completely locked down. The future is promising, and so on.</p>
<h3 id="e80">Smuggling Foreign Rice Flows into Chaoshan <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>The Right to Transport and Sell Grain in Shantou City Will Be Controlled by a Certain Foreigner</p>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: The monthly import of foreign rice into Shantou is no less than 100,000 bags. Currently, rice merchants, in response to the boycott of Siamese rice, have mostly switched to importing and selling Annam and Rangoon rice. In the first half of July, only 2,150 bags of Siamese rice were imported. However, a certain foreigner in Shantou is taking this opportunity to jointly establish a rice shop, planning to directly charter ships to transport rice from Siam to Shantou for distribution. Relying on special preferential trade agreements, the foreigner does not pay the special agricultural product tax when the rice arrives in Shantou. The North-South lines, charter lines, and grain lines of Shantou are greatly panicked upon hearing this news and have held several meetings and telegraphed the provincial government to inquire about countermeasures. This is because the foreign rice imported by our own people is subject to a special tax of more than three yuan per bag, while the rice imported by the foreigner is not subject to special taxes. Moreover, they have opened retail shops in Qi Lu, which are very prosperous. If the market price is twelve catties of rice per yuan, they sell seventeen or eighteen catties. Most of those who buy are poor people, some coming from as far as Chenghai Oumen and Chaoan Anbu to buy in Shantou. The foreigner has a protective amulet, and the tax bureau inspectors dare not interfere. Most of the rice buyers are poor people, so there is no way to restrict them from buying good rice. Yesterday, the Japanese ship "Guangdong Maru" and the Chaozhou ship arrived in Shantou from Hong Kong, carrying the 15th batch of Siamese rice, more than 800 bags. After being unloaded at the customs and inspected by customs officials, it was transported by freight car to the foreigner's rice shop on Xinxing Road in Qi Lu. The inspectors looked aside, and passersby were amazed. As smuggled rice is continuously being imported, the market price of rice has plummeted. According to rice merchants, the foreigner can make a profit of 20% on each yuan's worth of tax-free rice, while domestic merchants will lose money on the rice they import at thirteen catties per yuan. However, given the situation, even at a loss, they must sell the rice, otherwise they will have to pay warehouse rent, and the rice will be damaged by rats and insects over time. It is better to sell it all at a loss at once, temporarily suspend business, and wait for the government to resolve the issue. If the government has no solution, the Chinese grain shops will have to wait for their demise. The right to transport and sell grain will henceforth be transferred to the foreigner's hands, which is truly heartbreaking. (July 17th)</p>
<p>Songjiang: Water Police Patrol and Seize Smuggled Opium</p>
<p>He Tu, the leader of the second squad of the third team of the first district of the Water Police Provincial Public Team, led patrol officers Gu Lansheng and others on patrol through Sijing, Qibao, and reached the Fengjing Xinbang area. On the 21st, based on a report that Zhai Xingrang in the area was suspected of selling opium and operating a private opium den, they quietly led officers and police to search the premises and seized more than ten taels of smuggled opium, 8.7 qian of official opium, opium pipes, and many other items. With both the person and the evidence in hand, they took them back to the squad headquarters for interrogation and then prepared a document to transfer them to the county government on the 22nd for legal action.</p>
<p>Suzhou: Demolition of Enclosed Fields Causes Riot Among Tenant Farmers</p>
<p>The enclosure of lake fields in East Taihu, carried out jointly by the governments of Wu County and Wujiang County, dispatched provincial security teams and over 7,000 villagers to demolish the enclosures. All the enclosed fields and embankments of various companies, such as Gongcheng, Minsheng, and Nankai, have been completely demolished. However, on the 21st, during the demolition, near Nankai, over 200 tenant farmers who had enclosed 70 shares suddenly beat gongs and fired guns, intending to riot and obstruct the demolition. Fortunately, battalion adjutant Nie led the team to deploy carefully, and the tenant farmers could not succeed. The security team arrested 14 rioting tenant farmers, including Fang Zongxian, and Wujiang also arrested two, all of whom were detained at the team headquarters. The county government has submitted a request to the province for instructions on how to handle the matter. The magistrates of Wujiang and Wu County will discuss how to handle the remaining issues immediately.</p>
<p>Wuxi: Flour Boat Encounters Bandits in Taihu Lake</p>
<p>Zhou Xingquan, from Jiangxiqiao in the southern suburbs of this county, has been transporting flour for the Maoxin Flour Company. On the 21st, his barge was fully loaded with flour and transported to Huzhou, Zhejiang. After unloading the goods, he was sailing back to Wuxi when he encountered a bandit boat near the Shushankou Wutangmen area of Taihu Lake. Seven bandits jumped out, one with a pistol and the others with sharp blades, ordering the boat to stop. They arbitrarily searched and robbed. When crew members Xu Ape and Apan slightly resisted, they were stabbed three times, injuring their hands, but not seriously. On the 22nd, they sailed to the city and reported to the Public Security Bureau to request the arrest of the bandits and the recovery of the stolen goods.</p>
<p>Changzhou: Jiang Tide Rises Sharply, Embankments in Danger</p>
<p>Dehe Township in the third district of Wuyi County is mostly sandy fields. The residents there rely on dikes for protection. Recently, due to the sharp increase in the Yangtze River water level and the period of strong tides, the residents of each dike feel uneasy. A section of Xitaishun Dike in the third Bao of the township was breached by the river tide, about two Zhang long. The water rushed in, and the soybean seedlings in the dike were all submerged. Fortunately, the nearby police station supervised the Baojia heads and able-bodied men to work hard to block the breach, and it took three hours to close the breach. However, the adjacent Nanxing Dike, Dadunzi Dike, and Dongheshun Dike were all under heavy pressure from the river tide, and their current condition is dangerous. Several breaches have already occurred. If the river tide continues to surge, the collapse of the dikes is a concern. They are conscientiously preventing and blocking the breaches daily, and the Xiaochehe Public Security branch office reported to the county bureau on the 21st for instructions.</p>
<p>Yangzhou: Investigation of Baojia Reveals Bizarre Case</p>
<p>Dong Xueti, the chief of the third Bao of Huangjin Township in the ninth district of Jiangdu, discovered two suspicious men and women while compiling and investigating the Baojia at the home of Zhou Chengye in Yanting Village. He took them to the town office, where Shi, who was representing the town chief, inquired and learned that the man was named Wu Xuerong and the woman was named Cuiying. They had worked in Shanghai and returned home together and were temporarily staying with Zhou because they were relatives. Just as they were about to be sent to the district office, a person from Qianjiashan came to the town claiming that a daughter had been lost many years ago and suspected that she was Cuiying. He brought a photo of a girl slightly resembling Cuiying for comparison. There was only a one- or two-point resemblance in the eyebrows, so he confirmed that Cuiying was his daughter. Cuiying also recognized him as her father, so Qiu Yongkang, the Jia head of Baocheng Township, vouched for her. Later, Qian saw that Cuiying's behavior was not like that of his daughter. Then, blacksmith Qiu Ruhai recognized Cuiying as his wife and went directly to the Public Security Detective Team to report. The detective captain Hu Keyin has now taken all the witnesses to the team for interrogation. It is not yet known what the truth is.</p>
<p>Zhenjiang: Provincial Chamber of Commerce Holds Executive and Supervisory Meeting</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Chamber of Commerce also held a joint executive and supervisory meeting in Zhenjiang on the afternoon of the 21st, chaired by Yu Shichuan. Matters discussed included: (1) A letter from the Third Section of the Construction Department stating that this province is scheduled to convene a representative meeting of various trade associations for silk, cloth, and spun yarn on August 1st and 2nd, regarding matters that should be established and reformed in each industry, hoping that proposals will be submitted by each industry for discussion. How should this be handled? It was resolved that Mr. Qian Sunqing should draft the silk industry plan, Mr. Cheng Ganqing should draft the silk fabric industry plan, and Mr. Lin Junbao and Mr. Wu Shuying should draft the cotton yarn fabric industry plan. All should be submitted to the association for transfer to the department within five days. (2) A letter from the Beijing Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Wu County Chamber of Commerce requesting a joint petition for the promulgation and implementation of the Stamp Tax Law. How should this be handled? It was resolved to pass the proposal. (3) It was resolved to convene the fourth members' meeting on October 1st, with the meeting period set for two days.</p>
<p>Haimen: Steam Boiler Explosion Injures Five People</p>
<p>Chen Hesheng Dyehouse in Hehe Town, District 5, has been open for many years and has been quite successful. Recently, in order to improve its products and compete with its peers, it purchased new-style machinery and hired five technicians. On the morning of the 20th, the machinery was completely installed, and they began dyeing cloth. However, the quality of the steam boiler was poor, and it suddenly exploded. Iron pieces flew in all directions, and five technicians, including Zhu Laoer, were all injured by the explosion. Blood flowed like a river, and they fell to the ground in extreme pain. The shop owner hired a doctor to treat them, and it is said that their injuries are quite serious, and there may be danger to their lives.</p>
<p>Hangzhou: Xu Qinwen Case Retrial Judgment</p>
<p>The Xu Qinwen case, involving the Liutao tragedy at the West Lake Art School, was suspected of endangering the Republic of China. The Zhejiang High Court sentenced him to three years and six months of imprisonment. The Supreme Court found that there were doubts and sent it back for retrial. The High Court had held one hearing. The judgment was announced on the morning of the 22nd. The main text of the judgment was: Xu Qinwen knowingly concealed the fact that he was a traitor and did not report him, so he was given a reduced sentence of two years of imprisonment with a three-year suspended sentence.</p>

Article 16: If the loan applicant is already a guarantor business for a small credit loan, the loan standard amount shall include the amount guaranteed by the guarantor business (for example, if the applicant is qualified for a loan of 10,000 yuan, but has a guarantee responsibility of 3,000 yuan, then only 7,000 yuan can be loaned to him/her). Article 17: Matters not covered in these Detailed Rules may be resolved by the Committee and submitted to the Ministry of Finance for approval and implementation. Article 18: These Detailed Rules shall be implemented from the date of approval by the Ministry of Finance.</p>
<h3 id="e82">Founding of the Banking Association: Bank Acceptance Bills; Banking Associations Prepare to Organize Bill Acceptance Offices to Take Charge of Operations <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>Shen Shi News Agency reports that the Shanghai Banking Association, in order to alleviate the tight currency situation, has resolved to issue bank acceptance bills to circulate in the market. The small group committee has already decided that the reserve fund will be 30 million to 50 million yuan as a second collateral for acceptance bills. The Central Bank has also agreed to handle rediscounting. It is expected to be implemented in mid-August. A detailed report is as follows:</p>
<p>Creating Bank Acceptance Bills</p>
<p>Since the financial turmoil in Shanghai, a tight currency situation has resulted. Industry and commerce are suffering from the circulation of funds. The major banks in the city, including the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Shanghai Commercial &amp; Savings Bank, etc., in view of this, have held meetings and discussions for days. As a result, they will recommend that the Banking Association create bank acceptance bills. After the last meeting of the Banking Association passed the principle and handed it over to the small group committee for handling, detailed methods have now been formulated. They will be implemented after being submitted to the Standing Committee and General Membership Meeting of the Banking Association for approval. Industry and commerce have also expressed their support for this method, so there is no problem with its realization.</p>
<p>Bank Acceptance Bills Have Double Guarantee</p>
<p>In order to handle bank acceptance bills, the Banking Association has decided to have the Bank Reserve Committee establish a bill acceptance office to be responsible for handling bank acceptance bill matters. Industrial and commercial customers with real goods can apply to the office for acceptance bills. After the office assesses the price, it will issue a bill with a corresponding amount of silver. Industrial and commercial customers can then take the bill to any member bank for discounting, which is extremely convenient. At the same time, in terms of credit, in addition to the specified goods as the first collateral in substance, there is also a reserve fund recognized by the joint reserve of the Banking Association as the second collateral, so its credit is more reliable than the promissory notes issued by individual banks. In the future, foreign trade can also handle trade finance, and its scope of circulation is extremely wide.</p>
<p>Increase Circulation by 50 Million</p>
<p>This time, the total amount of bank acceptance bills handled by the Banking Association is limited to about 30 million to 50 million yuan. The reserve fund part of the second guarantee will be subscribed by all 36 member banks separately. Negotiations are currently underway, so after the implementation of these acceptance bills, the financial sector can invisibly increase the circulation by 30 million to 50 million yuan. Not only will the funds of the industrial and commercial sectors be able to circulate as a result, but the Banking Association itself can also adjust through this bill.</p>
<p>Limit the Acceptance Quantity of Each Industry</p>
<p>These bank acceptance bills are currently being actively prepared by the joint reserve of the Banking Association and are expected to be realized in mid-August. The autumn agricultural products will be launched, and the demand for funds from the inland rural areas and the industrial and commercial sectors will be high, so it is necessary to realize them as soon as possible. According to reliable sources, there are strict allocation restrictions for each industry for these acceptance bills. The main ones are flour, cotton yarn, groceries, oils, cement, and national product factories producing quality export goods, etc., and corresponding quantities are limited according to the needs of each industry. The purpose of acceptance is to develop the national product production industry and support export purposes. The term of the acceptance bill shall not exceed four months at most.</p>
<p>Central Bank Agrees to Rediscount</p>
<p>In order to expand the scope of circulation, the Banking Association, which founded bank acceptance bills, needs to have the Central Bank handle rediscounting, so it has sent personnel for informal contact several times. Because it concerns financial relief, it has been approved to handle bank acceptance bill rediscounting and other businesses in accordance with the commercial acceptance bill method. Therefore, in the future, when various banks feel that they have absorbed an excessive amount of these bills, they can transfer them to the Central Bank for rediscounting in order to maintain stability.</p>

<p>Guo Wen News Agency reports that a hurricane recently occurred in the South Pacific and has been blowing northward through Luzon and Taiwan for days. At 12:00 noon yesterday, the Shanghai Xujiahui Observatory received a report that the hurricane had reached 27 degrees north latitude and 123 degrees east longitude, and the direction was still west-northwest, which is close to Wenzhou and Fuzhou. If the direction does not change, it may impact Shanghai, but the coastal areas at the junction of Jiangsu and Zhejiang are obstructed by many mountains, and the wind may change direction after being obstructed. It is difficult to predict whether the direction will change. As for the wind force of the hurricane, it is said that it is about five to six in northeast Taiwan and the momentum is turning fierce in the eastern ocean, with a wind force of nine. However, the wind is in the ocean, which is different from the land. If the hurricane lands in Wenzhou, its momentum may be slightly reduced. There is another new hurricane rising in the Pacific Ocean, but it is far from Shanghai and the direction is unknown. The temperature yesterday was cool due to rainy and cloudy weather and a weak northeast wind, with a high of 91.9 degrees and a low of 77.5 degrees.</p>
<p>Another report states that since the beginning of summer, Shanghai has been dry with little rain, and it has almost caused a drought. Since the beginning of this month, there have been continuous rains, and in the last three days, there have been showers every day, so the fields have been sufficiently moistened. In addition, the rivers in the inner river ports are full of water, almost flush with the shore. If it rains again, it will damage agricultural affairs and harm cotton and rice. It is now feared that in lower fields, there is already too much water, and farmers are pumping water out. If the weather does not clear up and the rainfall increases by half a foot, it will inevitably lead to flooding.</p>

<p>Xu Shiying, Chairman of the National Government Relief Committee, sent a telegram to Wang Yiting and others: Elder Wang and all elders, I arrived in Hankou on the night of Jia day. The Zhang Gong embankment is gradually getting out of danger due to the efforts of military and political officials to supervise and order the people to block it together. The wind was strong yesterday and today, and it is said that it has been properly taken care of and should be safe. This afternoon, Chairman Zhang Yuejun and Supervisor Gao Yihan took a plane to view the upper reaches. It passed through Jiayu, Xindi, Jianli, Shishou, Gong'an, Shashi, Jiangling, Qianjiang, Tianmen, Hanchuan, and Hanyang. Except for the Shashi city area and Qianjiang city, which were slightly exposed to water, all of them have been submerged and turned into swamps. Tianmen and Hanchuan are the most tragic, and the people are in dire straits, which is very sad. After the establishment of the Hubei Provincial Flood Relief Association, funds were raised and remitted to various counties for relief, and rice, noodles, and miscellaneous grains were prepared and dispatched in various ways. The work is tense, and the survey personnel have also set off successively. I will stay in Wuhan tomorrow to inspect the Zhang Gong embankment, and then transfer to Changsha in the evening. I also heard that I, Shiying, am viewing on Jia day.</p>

<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Yangtze River liner Jiangda, which departed from Shanghai for Hankou on the 17th of this month and arrived in Hankou on the 21st, was originally scheduled to return to Shanghai from Hankou today after loading and unloading goods and passengers. However, on the morning of the 21st, when the ship arrived at Yangluo, about 60 nautical miles from Hankou, the river water was extremely high, a vast expanse, and it was difficult to identify whether the track was a shallow shore or a deep place. The Jiangda sailed to the river surface opposite Yangluo, and the pilot accidentally drove onto a shoal, causing the ship to run aground and unable to move. It urgently telegraphed to the Shanghai and Hankou branches for help.</p>
<p>Telegram to Shanghai for Help: The place where the Jiangda ran aground is only a three-hour voyage from Hankou. Due to the flood, the waterway was mistaken, causing it to be deeply trapped. It has repeatedly reversed, but has failed to withdraw from the shoal. The Jianghua liner of the branch saw it and telegraphed to Shanghai for help through the captain of the Jianghua. The original telegram arrived at the branch yesterday afternoon, stating briefly that the Jiangda ran aground on the opposite bank of Yangluo. Due to the dangerous river water, it urgently needs to be towed and rescued. It is not advisable to delay the matter as the water recedes day by day. The Shanghai branch obtained the telegram and immediately telegraphed the Hankou branch to quickly dispatch the Liji liner to rush to tow and rescue.</p>
<p>Discharge Coal and Cargo: Now the most feared thing is that the draft of the hull will become shallower after the water recedes, making rescue difficult. Shipowner Feng Jun has now decided to discharge the cargo and coal in the Jiangda ship first to reduce the load. Then, when the Jiangda hull slightly rises above the water, it will carry out towing work. The shipping department of the branch has telegraphed the Hankou branch and instructed the Jiangda shipowner to do so.</p>

<h3 id="e89">"New Life Weekly" Case: Du Houyu's Appeal and Protest Argues That Article 367 of the Criminal Procedure Law Does Not Apply and Interprets the Meaning of Jurisdiction Defined by the Court Organization Law <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>According to New Sound News Agency, after the judgment in the New Life Weekly case, Hou Yu, the wife of Du Chongyuan, dissatisfied with the judgment of the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court, filed an independent appeal with the original trial court. However, this appeal was rejected by the Criminal Division of the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court on the 20th of this month. It is learned that Mrs. Du also submitted a petition to the Supreme Court within the statutory period, requesting a redress of this case. Therefore, although the Second Branch of the High Court has rejected Mrs. Du's appeal, the hope for an appeal in this case has not yet been extinguished, and it is also heard that a protest has now been filed. The appeal and its written reasons are recorded below:</p>
<p>Criminal Appeal: In order to express disagreement with the fifth instance judgment made by the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court regarding the case of my husband, Du Chongyuan, endangering foreign relations, declare appeal for cultural activities, respectfully requesting that the files be examined and handled. Upon investigation, my husband, Du Chongyuan, was sued for endangering foreign relations and sentenced by Jiangsu High Court Second Branch to one year and two months of imprisonment on July 9 of this year, and the judgment was concurrently made on July 11. Both the appellant and Du Chongyuan himself feel that this judgment cannot be accepted, and in accordance with Article 337 of the Criminal Procedure Law, for the benefit of the defendant, an independent appeal is filed against the first instance judgment. However, because the original trial court, after announcing the judgment, declared in court that this judgment could not be appealed and immediately ordered imprisonment to carry out the sentence, it clearly misunderstood the law. The reason for the misunderstanding is that it failed to study Article 368 of the Criminal Procedure Law in conjunction with Article 17, Paragraph 1 and Article 22, Paragraph 1 of the Court Organization Law, thereby confusing the first instance judgment of the High Court and its branch courts on the crime of endangering foreign relations with the second instance judgment, without distinguishing them. It also mistakenly believes that the applicable procedures specified in Article 367, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Procedure Law are also provisions restricting appeals. It is not known whether an appeal should be allowed in this case is one issue, and whether the second or third instance procedure should be applied after the appeal is another issue. Article 367, Paragraph 2 of the Procedure Law only indicates that the Supreme Court's trial of appeals against first instance judgments of the High Court should apply the second instance procedure, and cannot restrict the application of Article 21, Paragraph 1 of the Court Organization Law. The original trial court's distortion is alarming. In order to prevent the original trial court from stubbornly adhering to its mistaken views, regarding the appellant's appeal, or from again misquoting Article 376 of the Criminal Procedure Law and rejecting it outright, in addition to separately filing an appeal with the original trial court, pointing out the errors, and separately submitting written reasons for the appeal in accordance with the statutory period, please forward them for review and judgment by the Supreme Court to redress the injustice. Respectfully submitted to the Supreme Court for review, by Hou Yu.</p>
<p>Reasons for Appeal: In order to supplement the reasons for the appeal in the case of Du Chongyuan's endangering foreign relations, against the first instance judgment made by the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court, my husband, Du Chongyuan, is the editor and publisher of "New Life Weekly". Because the 15th issue of Volume 2 of "New Life Weekly" on January 4 of this year contained an article entitled "Idle Talk of the Emperor" signed by Yi Shui, it was discovered by the Japanese Consul-General in Shanghai, who went to the Shanghai Municipal Government to request prosecution according to law. The Shanghai Municipal Police Department sent a letter to the prosecutor of the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court to initiate a public prosecution. The court ruled on July 9 of this year, "Du Chongyuan disseminated words to jointly defame, sentenced to one year and two months of imprisonment, and confiscated the 15th issue of Volume 2 of 'New Life Weekly'," and instructed that this case belongs to the crime listed in Article 61 of the Criminal Law and, in accordance with Article 368 and Article 367, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law, is not allowed to be appealed, and ordered to be sent to prison for execution on the same day. The appellant and Du Chongyuan himself firmly disagree with the above judgment, and believe that the distortion of the ruling is suspected of deliberately destroying the law. In accordance with the provisions of Article 327 of the Criminal Procedure Law, within the statutory appeal period, errors were made and appeal documents were submitted to the original trial court and the appellate court on the same day, declaring disagreement for the benefit of the defendant. Now, in accordance with the period stipulated in Article 374 of the Criminal Procedure Law, I am submitting additional reasons, which are detailed as follows: (1) Whether the appeal should be allowed, (2) Whether the conditions for prosecution are met, and (3) Whether there is criminal responsibility. (1) Whether the appeal should be allowed. Upon investigation, the original trial court recognized that the defendant Du Chongyuan had committed the crime of harming the reputation of the head of a friendly country and made a judgment of sentencing. This is the first instance criminal judgment for endangering foreign relations listed in Article 17, Paragraph 1 of the Court Organization Law. This first instance judgment can be appealed and should be under the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court, as clearly stated in Article 22, Paragraph 1 of the Court Organization Law. Although the statutory principal penalty for the crime of defamation is listed in Article 61 of the Criminal Law and should be subject to the restriction of Article 368 of the Criminal Procedure Law, which does not allow appeals to the third instance, defamation of the head of a friendly country is an independent crime under Article 116 of the Criminal Law. Since the new Criminal Procedure Law does not have an equivalent provision to Article 12 of the old Criminal Procedure Law, it cannot be equated with cases that should be subject to Article 368 of the Criminal Procedure Law, which does not allow appeals to the third instance, simply because the principal penalty for ordinary defamation is within the scope listed in Article 61 of the Criminal Law. Moreover, the so-called cases that cannot be appealed to the third instance court in that article are clearly limited to cases that have already been judged by the second instance. According to Article 17, Paragraph 1 of the Court Organization Law and Article 4 of the Criminal Procedure Law, the original trial jurisdiction is clearly the first instance and not the second instance. How can its first instance judgment claim to be the second instance and say that it should be subject to the restriction of not allowing appeals? Or it is said that the original trial court's distortion of the law is that it confuses the provision in Article 367, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Procedure Law, which states that "appeals against first instance judgments of the High Court also apply the third instance procedure," with the provision in Article 368 of the same law, and mistakenly believes that they both belong to the legal provisions restricting appeals to the third instance court. It should be known that the main purpose of Article 367, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Procedure Law is to stipulate the procedure that should be applied when the highest court hears appeals against first instance judgments of the High Court, that is, its appeal must be handled in accordance with the provisions of Article 369 and subsequent articles of the same law, and not according to the second instance trial procedure. It has nothing to do with the question of whether the first instance judgment made by the High Court should be allowed to be appealed. If it were not for taking the text out of context and omitting the words "trial by the highest court," there would be no possibility of distortion. The wording of Article 368 of the same law also states that cases that have been judged by the second instance cannot be appealed to the third instance court, and does not state that cases judged by the High Court cannot be appealed to the highest court. Its original legislative intention is very clear. From the perspective of legislative reasons, the first instance jurisdiction court for cases of endangering foreign relations is the High Court, which is intended to show special caution because these cases are related to national security. How can there be any intention to suppress appeals? If a guilty verdict is received by the defendant, what would be the repercussions when a miscarriage of justice occurs? If a verdict of not guilty is received by the defendant, what happens upon their exoneration? Modern countries with a legal system absolutely do not adopt the principle of single-level trial in ordinary litigation. There are only slight differences in the number of trials. The Criminal Procedure Law clearly states the principle of three trials and lists several cases of minor crimes, which, after being judged by the second instance, cannot be appealed to the third instance as an exception. Since endangering foreign relations must not be regarded as a minor crime and relates to national security, and its first instance is under special jurisdiction, those who should be civil and administrative judges have created a strange theory of one instance finality, not allowing appeals. This is known to those who know the law to be absurd. Although this does not involve the main issue of the original judgment being illegal, it is related to whether this appeal is legal. Therefore, it is specially explained in advance in order to correct the illegal matters instructed by the original trial during the pronouncement. (2) Whether the conditions for prosecution are met. Article 119 of the Criminal Law stipulates that the crime of defamation in Article 116 and the crime in Article 118 must be prosecuted upon the request of the foreign government. The manner of the request is also clearly stipulated in Article 220, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Procedure Law. The Judicial Yuan's Interpretation No. 753 on June 7, 1932 also clearly states that this term must be a legal term of the foreign government or someone who can represent the foreign government. Based on the above legal articles and interpretations, it is clear that the crime of defamation in Article 116 of the Criminal Law must be legally stated by the foreign government or someone who can represent the foreign government in order to meet the conditions for prosecution. Now, upon investigation of the facts stated in the original judgment and the original indictment, this case was only requested by the Japanese Consul-General in Shanghai to the Shanghai Municipal Government, and the Municipal Government ordered the Public Security Bureau to forward it for investigation and prosecution. The Consul-General in Shanghai cannot be regarded as the representative of the foreign government, and there is the aforementioned interpretation for reference, which is beyond doubt. The Shanghai Municipal Government and the Public Security Bureau cannot regard themselves as the highest officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Judicial Administration. Therefore, both the requester and the recipient of the request are not qualified, which means that the request cannot be regarded as legal. There are still shortcomings in the essential elements of the prosecution. The prosecutor's hasty public prosecution and the original trial's judgment on the substantive criminal law are both cases of acceptance without being accepted and violate the law. Responsibility lies with all, and in accordance with the provisions of Article 375, Paragraph 5 of the Criminal Procedure Law, the original trial should naturally be deemed inappropriate, and there is no room for applying Article 372 of the same law. (3) Whether there is criminal responsibility. Article 12 of the Criminal Law stipulates that conduct is not punishable if it is not intentional or negligent, that is, anything that is not intentional cannot be called the person's conduct, that is, it cannot be said that the person has committed a crime. The punishment for negligent conduct is limited to those that are specifically stipulated in the special provisions of the Criminal Law. According to the principle of criminal responsibility stipulated in this Criminal Law, the crime of defamation by disseminating words in Article 310 of the Criminal Law, in addition to those who commit the criminal act and those who knowingly assist, there is no so-called person who is naturally responsible in law. Because the Criminal Law and the Publication Law, which is a special law, are clearly different, the penalties in the Publication Law clearly stipulate which ones should make the publisher, editor, author, and printer jointly responsible, and which ones should make only one of them solely responsible. The crime of defamation by disseminating words in the Criminal Law only requires those who commit the crime and those who knowingly assist to be responsible. If the publisher and editor can prove that they did not know and participate, there is no basis for making them jointly responsible. The 15th issue of Volume 2 of "New Life Weekly" was published on May 4 of this year, and Du Chongyuan stayed in Jiangxi before that issue. The letter from the Jiangxi Pottery Administration has been submitted, which proves that Du Chongyuan did not participate in the publication and distribution of "Idle Talk of the Emperor" and did not know about it. Even if he should be blamed for dereliction of duty because he held the title of publisher and editor, or because he entrusted someone to edit on his behalf and entrusted the wrong person, there is no provision for punishing negligence in the crime of defamation under the law. The original trial was unwilling to conduct detailed trials and research on whether the article was a foreign submission, whether the author Yi Shui had another person, and whether the manuscripts for that issue had actually been selected by Du Chongyuan. They only believed that because Du Chongyuan held the position of editor and publisher, he should naturally be responsible in law. It is difficult to say that he has done his best in the trial. (Omission) Therefore, in addition to the improper distinction of criminal responsibility, the original judgment cannot be said to be erroneous in the application of criminal provisions. For the above reasons, I should ask the Supreme Court to review and, in accordance with the provisions of Article 271, Paragraph 5, Article 389, Article 390, Paragraph 2, and Article 295, Paragraph 1, Paragraph 3 of the Criminal Procedure Law, revoke the original judgment and instruct that this case should not be accepted, or immediately make a judgment of not guilty for the defendant Du Chongyuan. Respectfully submitted to the Supreme Court for review. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e94">Collected Flood Disaster Reports Received by the Huayang Righteous Relief Association <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>The Renji Road Huayang Righteous Relief Association has repeatedly received reports from the Hubei Branch, and the Fancheng Xiangyang Relief Committees, and the Catholic Church in Dongming, Hebei, and other organizations that this flood disaster is extremely serious and no less tragic than that of the 20th year of the Republic of China. It has also received reports from various provinces in Henan, Jiangxi, and Hubei, which are recorded below: (1) Chairman Liu Xiao of Henan telegraphed that the rivers have risen sharply, and floods have overflowed, submerging Yanshi, causing countless losses of property and lives throughout the city. The highest point is still eight or nine feet deep. Gongxian's new and old cities and various districts from 1567 have all become swamps. Other places such as Lanfeng, Chenliu, Xinye, Fengqiu, and Yancheng are also severely affected. Urgent funds or a large number of supplies are needed to save the remaining survivors. (2) The Jiangxi Provincial Relief Association reported on the general situation of the freeze-to-death flood disaster. According to detailed reports, from Jidongming to Yugan through Xinhuazi, a total of 42 counties have suffered disasters in every county and are waiting for relief. In late June, the situation deteriorated sharply, and postal and telecommunications communications were mostly cut off. Its severe and tragic situation can be seen. (3) Chairman Zhou of the Hanyang County Chamber of Commerce in Hubei telegraphed that since the 20th year of the Republic of China, floods have flooded the cities, and like bandits, they have ravaged the countryside, causing the people to suffer and lose their vitality. Unexpectedly, there was a severe drought last year, and this summer, it has been raining continuously. Official and civilian dikes collapsed in the afternoon, and urban and rural areas have all become swamps. It is even worse than the flood disaster in the 20th year. Houses were washed away, and crops were submerged in the ocean. The people suffered the same catastrophic disaster. Those who were spared from drifting have no place to live in the treetops and no food to fill their stomachs. Under the scorching sun, they are appealing in all directions to save their lamentations so that they can survive.</p>

<p>Chen Chixin Machinery Shop, located at 427 Tiantong Road, is an investment by Ningbo native Chen Baoquan (aka Ah Jin) and others. Chen has a concubine named Qian Ayue, who is 29 years old. She lives in the shop. However, Qian is addicted to gambling, resulting in heavy debt. On the 16th of this month, Chen Baoquan went to Ningbo on business. Fearing the shop would need funds, he gave a checkbook from Dunxu Bank and two stamps to the manager, Zhang Liaoming. Unexpectedly, the day before yesterday, Zhang suddenly discovered that the checkbook and stamps were missing. He went to Dunxu Bank to inquire and was told that on the 20th, a woman had presented a 300-yuan check for withdrawal. The bank had verified that the signature matched Chen Baoquan's and had paid the money. Zhang suspected Qian and reported it to the Jiaxing Road Police Station. Detective Ye Yusi was dispatched to arrest Qian. A key that matched the one on the counter and silver dollars worth 26 yuan were found during a search and taken back to the police station. Qian confessed without hesitation. Besides the 26 yuan recovered, the rest of the money had already been used to pay off gambling debts. Yesterday morning, she was sent to the Fifth Tribunal of the First Special District Court. The police lawyer, Li Zhishan, explained the situation and charged her with stealing and misusing stamps under articles 217 section 2 and 322 of the criminal law, requesting severe punishment. Zhang Ziming stated in court that the check, etc., were locked in a drawer at the time. He hired a lawyer to file a civil suit, requesting that the criminal judgment include a simultaneous ruling. When questioned, the defendant Qian Ayue confessed. Judge Dai Rongduo, after reviewing the confession, postponed the hearing because the case required further investigation.</p>

The meeting then discussed several other matters related to fundraising and concluded at around 4 p.m.</p>

<p>The Yuxing steamer, owned by Zhaoxing Company, originally sailed on the Russian Far East route. Recently, the steamer was chartered to transport goods from Yingkou to Fujian and Quanzhou. It was fully loaded with soybean cakes, grains, etc., from Niuzhuang to Xingquan for unloading and then transport goods from that port to Shanghai. On the morning of the 21st of this month, the steamer safely arrived in Quanzhou. While entering the port of Quanzhou, the steamer accidentally strayed from the waterway and ran aground on a reef.</p>
<p>After running aground, it withdrew. The waters near Xiaozhui Island in the port of Quanzhou have many reefs, making navigation difficult. Because of the careless route taken by the Yuxing, it hit a reef near Xiaozhui Island. The ship was suddenly stranded on the reef and could not move. The captain immediately engaged reverse thrust to move the ship off the reef. After some time, it was finally able to reach the port of Quanzhou.</p>
<p>Report to Shanghai. Yesterday, Zhaoxing Company received a telegram from the captain of the Yuxing, stating that the steamer ran aground near Xiaozhui Island when entering the port of Quanzhou at 10:30 a.m. on the 21st. The ship anchored in the port at 11:30 a.m. and was not taking on water. The telegram did not provide details on whether the hull was damaged. Further details will be available once the captain provides a detailed report. Yesterday, the company sent a letter to the China Ship Insurance Joint Association for investigation.</p>

<h3 id="e106">Shanghai's Anti-Smoking Campaign is in Full Swing; Municipal Government Issues Notice for Registration of Smokers; The Poor are Sent to Anti-Smoking Hospitals for Free Treatment <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Public Security Bureau, under the order of the Municipal Government, is in charge of the registration of smokers in Shanghai. Yesterday morning, it issued a notice that from today until the end of September is the deadline for smokers to report their addiction. All smokers in Shanghai should register with the bureau as scheduled. Those who voluntarily want to quit smoking but are too poor to afford medical treatment will be sent to anti-smoking hospitals for free treatment within these three months. Those who cannot quit immediately due to illness will be issued a limited-time smoking permit, allowing them to purchase and smoke opium paste. If they do not voluntarily register before September of this year, the period from October to the end of December will be the compulsory registration period. The bureau will fine captured smokers while forcing them to register. The bureau's regulations for smoker registration have also been officially announced. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Municipal Public Security Bureau Notice Regarding Registration. Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau Notice Fa Zi No. 137. It is well known that opium is extremely harmful and has long been banned. However, Shanghai is a city where people from all over gather, both good and bad are mixed, and unscrupulous people secretly open dens for people to smoke. Citizens indulge in their habits and do not pull themselves together. Therefore, although strict bans have been enforced, opium has not been eradicated. The reason for this is that Shanghai's anti-smoking program has not been publicized, treatment for smokers has not been widespread, and the management of opium sales has not been carried out according to regulations. Since April of this year, when the bureau received the "Implementation Measures for Banning Opium," we have drafted anti-smoking plans and requested instructions. Recently, the Municipal Government issued the "Measures for Registering Smokers During the Registration Period," ordering us to conduct smoker registration from this month until the end of December this year, etc. We have also drafted "Detailed Rules for Implementing Smoker Registration" and submitted them to the Municipal Government for approval and implementation. From today until the end of September is the deadline for smokers to voluntarily report. All smokers in Shanghai should register with the bureau as scheduled. Those who voluntarily want to quit smoking but are too poor to afford medical treatment will be sent to anti-smoking hospitals for free treatment within these three months. Those who cannot quit immediately due to illness will be issued a limited-time smoking permit, allowing them to purchase and smoke opium paste. The bureau has printed "Smoker Registration Application Forms" and "Smoker Registration Instructions" and distributed them to all bureaus, police stations, and sub-stations and outposts, so that smokers can obtain them anywhere, advise each other, and register with the bureau. If they do not voluntarily register before September of this year, the period from October to the end of December will be the compulsory registration period. The bureau will strictly investigate and punish all captured opium smokers with a fine of 50 yuan to 300 yuan according to regulations, and force them to register. After the registration deadline at the end of December, the bureau will stop issuing smoking permits. All smokers caught thereafter will be fined according to the promulgated regulations and sent to anti-smoking hospitals for compulsory treatment. It should be known that the bureau is carrying out this anti-smoking campaign in strict accordance with the high command's strict order to eradicate opium, with the determination to thoroughly eliminate it. During the registration period, we will first persuade, then force, and promote the campaign step by step. We urge all smokers in Shanghai to carefully examine and register, ensuring that no one is missed, so that after the registration deadline this year, we will have accurate data on the number of smokers and the amount and quality of opium consumed, and then gradually reduce it year by year, so that there is a standard. Five days after the posting of this notice, if there is any secret operation of trafficking or opening of opium dens for people to smoke, once discovered, the offenders will be handed over to the Songhu Garrison Headquarters for handling according to military law in accordance with the anti-smoking regulations issued by the Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission, and their property will be confiscated. This notice is hereby issued for general information. Everyone must abide by it and not violate it. Be sure.</p>
<p>Promulgated Smoker Registration Instructions. (1) The Significance of Smoker Registration. The purpose of the smoker registration carried out by the bureau is to ascertain the precise number of smokers in Shanghai, in order to have a standard for gradually reducing smoking year by year, so that all smokers can quit completely within a specified period. (2) Registration Deadline. The registration period for smokers in Shanghai is set at six months, divided into two phases. The first phase, from July to the end of September this year, is the voluntary registration period for smokers. All smokers in Shanghai must register with the bureau voluntarily. The second phase, from October to the end of December this year, is the compulsory registration period. The bureau will summon and question captured smokers. (3) Matters for Smoker Registration. Smokers who voluntarily report or are forcibly registered, those who voluntarily want to quit smoking will be sent to the hospital for treatment, and those who cannot quit immediately due to illness will be issued a smoking permit, allowing them to purchase and smoke opium paste temporarily, and gradually reduce the amount smoked. (4) Registration Application Form. (1) Smokers should first fill out a registration application form in order to obtain a limited-time smoking permit or await referral to an anti-smoking hospital. (2) The bureau has prepared three types of registration application forms: one for applying for an ordinary limited-time smoking permit, one for applying for a limited-time smoking permit for the poor, and one for requesting to quit smoking. The aforementioned application forms have been printed and distributed to all sub-bureaus, police stations, and sub-stations and outposts for smokers to obtain anywhere. (5) Obtaining an Ordinary Limited-Time Smoking Permit. (1) Applicants for an ordinary limited-time smoking permit should personally submit the registration application to the bureau for registration. The registration application form can be filled out in advance or temporarily at the bureau. Immediately pay the permit fee and obtain the limited-time smoking permit.

(3) The applicant can submit the registration application form and permit fee to the household registration office of the sub-bureau or police station in charge, immediately obtain a receipt, and go to the original agency where the registration application form was submitted three days later to exchange it for a limited-time smoking permit. (6) Obtaining a Limited-Time Smoking Permit for the Poor. (1) Applicants for a limited-time smoking permit for the poor should fill out a registration application form and a guarantee form, along with the permit fee, and submit them to the bureau or its subordinate sub-bureaus and police stations, immediately obtain a receipt, and come to the bureau or go to the original agency where the registration application form was submitted one week later to exchange it for a limited-time smoking permit for the poor. (2) Qualifications of the Guarantor. Any friend or relative of the smoker with a confirmed address and family can be a guarantor. (3) If the bureau determines that an applicant for a limited-time smoking permit for the poor is not actually poor, they should be punished in accordance with the provisions of items B and C of Article 5 of the "Measures for Registering Smokers During the Registration Period." The original text is recorded below: Item B of Article 5 of the "Measures for Registering Smokers During the Registration Period": "Those who are not truly poor shall not fraudulently obtain this type of permit for the poor. Violators shall not only be required to obtain an ordinary limited-time smoking permit but shall also be fined three to five times the permit fee of five yuan stipulated in Article 9 of the Regulations for Suppressing Smokers." Item C: "The permit for the poor must be issued only after the local Baozhang or Jiazhang has filled out a certificate proving that it is true. If there is any false reporting or concealment, the person providing the certificate shall be fined half the amount of the fine imposed." (4) Smokers who are illiterate can invite a guarantor to go to the bureau or its affiliated agencies to apply for registration. All registration application forms, guarantees, etc., can be filled out by the bureau staff and the household registration or internal affairs police officers of each sub-bureau and police station. (7) Limited-Time Smoking Permit for Travelers. When smokers travel to various places, they should submit the limited-time smoking permit they have obtained to the bureau, immediately pay the fee, and apply to exchange it for a limited-time smoking permit for travelers. (8) Fee Amount and Validity Period. The fee for each ordinary limited-time smoking permit is five yuan. The fee for each limited-time smoking permit for the poor is six jiao. The fee for each limited-time smoking permit for travelers is three yuan. Limited-time smoking permits must be exchanged every six months. The validity period of a travel permit is three months. (9) Requesting to Quit Smoking. (1) Smokers who request to quit smoking during voluntary registration will be sent to the municipal anti-smoking hospital for free treatment to show special consideration. (2) Smokers who request to quit smoking should fill out a request to quit smoking application form and submit it in person to the bureau or its subordinate agencies for investigation and registration. The registration application form can also be filled out temporarily upon submission. Immediately obtain a receipt and await the scheduled referral to the anti-smoking hospital. (3) The request to quit smoking application form should list the name and address of the guarantor, and the guarantor should sign and affix their seal. If the smoker deliberately evades and does not report to the bureau when the time for referral comes, the guarantor will be responsible for investigating and summoning them, and their registration qualification will be revoked. (10) Penalties for Failure to Register During the Compulsory Registration Period. They will be ordered to register retroactively, and people will be allowed to report them. If the report is verified, a percentage of the fine will be awarded as a reward. The methods for punishment and rewarding people for reporting will be implemented in accordance with the provisions of Article 4 of the "Measures for Registering Smokers During the Registration Period." The original text is recorded below: Article 4 of the "Measures for Registering Smokers During the Registration Period": "During the compulsory registration period, those who still conceal and attempt to evade registration will be allowed to be reported secretly by the people. Once verified, in addition to being registered retroactively in accordance with regulations, they will also be fined 50 yuan to 300 yuan. Those who make false accusations will be punished in reverse in accordance with the law. Thirty percent of the aforementioned fine will be awarded to the informant." (11) Handling After the End of the Compulsory Registration Period. After the end of the compulsory registration period, limited-time smoking permits will no longer be issued. If there are still people who secretly smoke and have not registered, after being discovered by the bureau, they will be punished in accordance with regulations and forced to quit. (12) The Basis for the Bureau's Suppression of Opium Smokers Thereafter. 1. After the registration of smokers in Shanghai, all suspects arrested for smoking opium will first be sent to an anti-smoking hospital for testing. If the test confirms that they are not addicted to opium, they will be released immediately. 2. After the registration of smokers in Shanghai, all cases of opening dens for people to smoke and other major trafficking cases discovered by the bureau will be handled in accordance with Article 8 of the "Measures for Registering Smokers During the Registration Period" issued by the Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission and Articles 3 and 20 of the "Regulations for Strictly Prohibiting Narcotics and Suppressing Opium Paste Shops."

<h3 id="e109">After the Collapse of Minghua Bank, the Shanghai Branch Cannot Be Sorted Out; Responsible Persons Are Not in Shanghai; Creditors File Lawsuit with the Court <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>The Minghua Bank on Henan Road, after the collapse of its Qingdao headquarters, took the same action and declared its closure, which has been over a month. It has no way to deal with the various debts it owes. The chairman of the bank, Tong Jinhui, is reportedly being detained by the Qingdao authorities, and the assistant manager, Miao Zhendong, is also in Qingdao, being monitored by local creditors in a hotel, fearing his escape. The general manager, Zhang Jiongbo, from Ningbo, is rumored to have returned to his hometown to evade debts, but others say he is still in Qingdao. Therefore, only the deputy manager, Yu Dehua, remains in Shanghai, making it increasingly difficult to quickly conduct the Shanghai branch's liquidation affairs. In general, depositors, because there is no prospect of repayment, have recently filed criminal lawsuits against the responsible persons of the bank with the First Special District Local Court. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Yang Zhaoxin opened a court session to examine the case of fraud and breach of trust brought by Qian Zhen against Tong, Zhang, Yu, and Miao. Of the four defendants, only Yu Dehua, accompanied by his defense lawyer, appeared in court. Qian Zhen stated in his complaint that he was originally from Zhenhai and worked in Shanghai. On May 1st of last year, he deposited 300 yuan, his savings, in the bank for a one-year term, and this year he continued to deposit for another year. Unexpectedly, it suddenly closed down in less than three weeks. This situation is a breach of faith and a fraud against depositors. Judge Yang then stated that since many of the defendants in this case had not appeared in court, and there were multiple lawsuits filed against the bank, he had already sent a letter to the Qingdao authorities to inquire about the progress of the liquidation. He stated that the case could only be clarified after receiving a reply from Qingdao, and adjourned the hearing to the afternoon of July 31st.</p>

<p>The Public Concession's Bureau of Police of the Municipal Council, based on the Publications Law, has ordered strict suppression of various publications that have not been registered with the relevant government office, in order to prevent them from spreading inaccurate information and confusing the public. It ordered all subordinate police stations to strictly suppress these publications. In one day, those selling tabloids on various roads were searched by Chinese and Western detectives and had unregistered tabloids confiscated. The confiscated tabloids included: "New Life News," "Sweat and Blood News," "Erotic News," "Fitness News," "Great Ming News," "Giant Wheel News," "Modern Daily," "Iron News," "Metropolitan News," "Robin Hood News," "Great Sun News," "Morning News," "Social News," "Social Pro-News," "Great Crystal News," "Broadcasting Daily," "Era Daily," "Spring and Autumn News," "Ming News," "Entertainment News," "Rainbow News," "Shanghai News," "Chinese Mainland News," "Sino-Foreign Forum," "Movie News," "Star News," "Life Daily," "Star Bi-Monthly," "Great Road," and dozens of other types. They were all sent to the Second Branch of the High Court yesterday morning for disposition. The Bureau of Police's lawyer, Ru Baoyi, stated in court the reasons for the suppression, requesting confiscation according to Articles 7, 8, 21, and 41 of the Publications Law. After discussion among Judges Zhou, Shi, and Wu, it was decided to proceed as requested by the Bureau of Police.</p>
<h3 id="e111">Notorious Bandit Leader from Jiangbei, Yue Youwei, Arrested; Zhenjiang Garrison Headquarters Requests Transfer <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>Yue Youwei, a notorious bandit leader from Jiangbei, also known as Feng Youcai, nicknamed "Marshal Yue," and also known as "Baldy Yue" because of his pockmarked head, is 44 years old and from Funing. He has over three to four thousand followers and possesses all kinds of firearms. He has committed numerous cases of kidnapping, extortion, arson, murder, and robbery in the counties of Xu, Huai, and Hai in Jiangbei. Recently, he fled to Shanghai to hide. The county governments of Yancheng and thirteen other counties reported this to their superiors, who approved a bounty for his arrest. The Zhenjiang Garrison Commander, Xiang Zhizhuang, secretly ordered the deputy director of the special affairs team, Hu Zhen, to bring his detectives to Shanghai to secretly investigate with the Shanghai Municipal Public Safety Bureau. Until the 21st, Hu Zhen received a tip from an informant that Yue was hiding in Room 31, Wuling Apartment, No. 2 Lane, 244 Baille Road, in the French Concession. Hu immediately, together with detectives from the Municipal Public Safety Bureau, Wang Zhengrong, etc., reported to the French Concession police station at 1:45 a.m. yesterday and dispatched Western detectives led by Deputy Inspector Lu Zhixiang and Detective Song Yunfeng, etc., to the address of Room 31 in Wuling Apartment. They found Yue and his follower, Fei Jinhong (40 years old, from Funing), inside the room and immediately arrested them both, taking them back to the police station for detention. Yesterday at noon, they were sent to the First Criminal Division of the Special Second Court, where Judge Wang Gangxu, along with clerk Zheng Rongsheng, interrogated them. First, they asked the defendants Yue and Fei about their ages and origins. According to Yue, he came to Shanghai to look for work but has not found it yet. Fei stated that his wife used to run a cloth factory business, but it stopped after her death and he is currently unemployed. Then, the Bureau of Police's lawyer, Fei Xizhen, presented the case, stating briefly that the defendants were notorious bandit leaders from Jiangbei and that the police station had received a request for assistance from the Zhenjiang Garrison Command to arrest them. The Garrison Command had no objection to the transfer. Hu Lingxing and Wang Zhengrong, who came from the Command, also submitted a statement detailing the process of arresting the defendants. They also stated that the Command had prepared a document to the Shanghai Municipal Public Safety Bureau requesting permission to transfer the defendants for investigation. The court verified the statements and, since the request for transfer from the Command did not have a valid official document and the procedures were incomplete, ordered that they would be handled after receiving a letter from the Shanghai Municipal Public Safety Bureau. The defendants were detained.</p>

<p>The Tongren Fuyuan Branch Hall in the French Concession has recently received three letters reporting suicides in the river.

Unexpectedly, after the publication of this news, the hall has continuously received similar letters, creating a new trend for suicides. Yesterday, around 3 p.m., the hall received another letter from the post office, sent from this port and signed with the code "Cbony." The letter stated that he had graduated from a primary school in Fengxian and intended to apply to junior high school, but his mother refused, wanting him to apprentice instead. His father worked in a factory in Shanghai and lived at his uncle's house. He took three silver dollars from home and came to Shanghai to find his father and ask for money to go to school. After arriving in Shanghai, he did not know the address, looked around sleeplessly, and spent the money he had brought on hotels and restaurants, with little left. Unable to endure it any longer, he was overwhelmed with anger and wanted to commit suicide in the river. He was wearing a white twill suit and had a graduation certificate. He hoped that after the hall received the letter, they would pay attention to salvaging the body near Xiaodongmen River. If it was salvaged, please publish a notice for his father, Wang Qicheng, to collect it. He also stated that the letter was sent two hours before the suicide. The hall has informed the Nanshi Life Saving Bureau to pay attention to salvaging the body.</p>

<p>Xu Heshang, a local resident residing at No. 8, Lane 310, Tangshan Road, 44 years old, bought shaved ice from Lu Axiao (from Nanxiang, 22 years old), who set up a cold drink stall in front of the Fuxingguan Congee Shop at No. 643, Dongyouheng Road, at around 8 a.m. on the 17th of this month. He did not pay the copper coins, leading to a dispute between the two, which then turned into a mutual brawl. Afterwards, Xu returned home and felt chest pain after being beaten. He died suddenly at around 1 p.m. the next day. Xu's wife, Zhang, then went to Lu's place and reported him, and he was detained in the Jiaxing Road Police Station. Hua Detective Jin Yangwu and others were dispatched to investigate, and Xu's body was taken to the autopsy site on Feilun Road. The next morning, Lu was sent to the First Special Court for detention. The procuratorate of the court commissioned prosecutors to go to the autopsy site to examine the body. At the time, the cause of death could not be determined from the external appearance of the body, so it was decided to perform an autopsy to clarify the truth. This has already been reported in the newspapers. Yesterday morning, the autopsy was completed, and it was found that two of the deceased's left ribs were broken and he had symptoms of tuberculosis. At around 10 a.m., Prosecutor Guo Wei, along with forensic doctors Wei and Zhang, and clerk Wang Zuyi, etc., were commissioned by the Special First Court to go to the site and inform the relevant police station of the autopsy results.

The suspect Lu Axiao should be prosecuted by the police station and sent to the court for handling. The body was handed over to his wife, Xu Zhang, for burial after she signed a bond.</p>

<p>After the World Commercial Savings Bank closed down, the shareholders' meeting resolved to announce liquidation and entrusted lawyer Jiang Yiping and accountant Jiang Wanping as liquidators. Accountant Jiang, together with Tao Moqing, the supervising and liquidation commissioner of the Ministry of Finance, took over yesterday morning and immediately handled the registration. Details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Announcing Liquidation: Accountant Jiang Wanping and lawyer Jiang Yiping, representing the World Bank, announced the liquidation and notified all creditors and debtors: "Our company has been resolved by a special shareholders' meeting to announce liquidation, and we, the accountant and lawyer, have been appointed as liquidators of the company. In addition to accepting the appointment according to law, we will immediately submit it to the Ministry of Finance and the court for record, and after submitting it to the Ministry of Finance for the selection and appointment of a supervising and liquidation commissioner, we should immediately announce to all creditors, in accordance with the company law liquidation regulations, that within one month from today, they should bring their credit certificates to this liquidation office to report their claims for registration and verification. All debtors should, within the same period, send the principal and interest owed in full to this liquidation office in exchange for a receipt stamped with the seal of this accountant to clear their responsibilities. Please do not delay, lest it lead to pursuit. This is hereby announced."</p>
<p>Taking Over Together: At 9 a.m. yesterday, liquidator Jiang Wanping, along with Tao Moqing, the supervising and liquidation commissioner of the Ministry of Finance, and his staff, went to the bank on Fuzhou Road, opened the seals on the documents that had been kept in custody, and took over immediately.

<h3 id="e117">Liquidators of Huaying Pharmacy Request the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to Try Mediation; The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Has Agreed to Accept <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>After Huaying Pharmacy closed down, the shareholders' meeting entrusted lawyers Zhang Shizhao and Yuan Xingyun, and accountant Qin Kai, to handle the liquidation. It is heard that the liquidators have now prepared a mediation plan and sent a letter to the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce to try mediation in accordance with the new bankruptcy law's mediation regulations. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce has also agreed to accept. After convening a meeting of creditors and obtaining their consent, they will try to handle it. The original letter from the company's liquidators to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce is as follows: "Dear Sirs, This is to inform you that our Huaying Pharmacy Co., Ltd. was resolved by a special shareholders' meeting on February 28th of this year to cease liquidation, and accountant Xie Lin was elected as the company's liquidator. Later, accountant Xie resigned due to matters, and the company's special shareholders' meeting on June 25th of this year elected our lawyers, accountants, etc., as the company's liquidators. We have taken office and reported to the Shanghai First District Local Court for record. The company's book assets and liabilities were originally offset, but the company's property is mainly composed of medicines and Western medicine raw materials, accounting for about 60% of the total assets. Previously, the book value was advertised for bidding, but no one has inquired about it. If the price is reduced for bidding again, the company's assets will obviously be insufficient to pay off the debts. It is the duty of our lawyers to suspend the liquidation and apply to the court for bankruptcy according to law. However, the value of the pharmaceutical raw materials stored by the company is very large. At this time of commercial failure, a wholesale auction will not only fear that there will be no one to undertake it, but it will also be more difficult to sell it at a good price. Moreover, the legal procedure for applying to the court for bankruptcy will take a long time, and the loss of creditors will be even more unimaginable. After repeated consideration, the lawyers prepared a more favorable mediation plan for the creditors, and in accordance with the new bankruptcy law's mediation regulations, we have attached a statement of property conditions and a list of creditors and debtors, and sent them to your association for inspection, to schedule a meeting of creditors, and to conduct mediation. We sincerely appreciate your public assistance."</p>

<p>The Fuyuan steamer of the Jufu Foreign Firm is the oldest ship sailing on the Sichuan River route. The hull is strong, stable, and fast. Since its maiden voyage more than ten years ago, it has been very safe. Its comfortable cabins, affordable fares, complete facilities, and attentive service are especially praised by passengers. The steamer's itinerary usually stops at Hanwan to load and unload cargo, taking nine and a half days to travel upstream from Shanghai to Chongqing and five and a half days to travel downstream from Chongqing to Shanghai. However, it departed from Chongqing at dawn on the 18th this time. Because it did not unload cargo along the way, it arrived in Shanghai at noon on the 22nd, taking only four and a half days. Its safety and speed are truly rare and it is indeed a new record for navigation on the Sichuan River route.</p>

<p>Guo Wang, a woman from Yancheng, residing in a straw shed in Xiaoshadu, was 52 years old. She had a son named Kai Tai, who worked as a laborer and married a woman named Wang. The family of several could manage to make a living. However, Guo Wang was plagued by illness and repeated medical treatments were ineffective. She resented her prolonged illness, spent her days sighing in frustration, and developed a desire to end her life. She attempted suicide three times, but each time she was discovered and rescued, escaping death. On the afternoon of the day before yesterday, around 2 PM, taking advantage of the fact that her son and daughter-in-law were out working and no one was around, believing the opportunity had arrived, she hanged herself with a rope from a bamboo pole behind the straw shed. When her son and daughter-in-law returned home after work and saw her, she was already cold as ice and beyond saving. The matter was discovered by the local police station. Fearing there might be other circumstances, they instructed the local security officer, Dong Xiqing, yesterday morning to report to the local court and request a coroner's inquest. Also, Du Maochang, a partner in the Hongxing Pig Business in Yangjing Town, Pudong, a native of Nanhui, recently suffered some unknown shock. On the night before last, he suddenly committed suicide by taking poison in his residence next to the fire brigade on Dingshui Road, north of Yangjing Road. Yesterday morning, his roommates discovered that Du had died and found a note of grievance on his body. They reported this to the police officer on duty, who took the note back to the Yangjing Police Station and ordered Zhuang Hongkui, the local security officer of the 24th Bao, 20th Tu, to report to the court for an inquest. For both of these cases, Prosecutor Du Jiasheng, commissioned by the court, along with Inspector Shen Qixiu, went to conduct the inquests in the afternoon.</p>

<p>Social Bureau Regulates Transfer Procedures for Female Students</p>
<p>Since Beijing has rigorously implemented the separation of boys' and girls' schools in middle schools, the Social Bureau has been actively preparing to establish the Second Girls' Middle School and expand the First Girls' Middle School to accommodate female students from private co-educational middle schools. In addition to ordering each private middle school to report the list of female students currently in the second and third grades of junior and senior high school in each school to serve as a basis for arrangement, the bureau also took into consideration that very few names were being sent from the private schools to the bureau, and for the convenience of each female student's studies. It is specifically stipulated that each student may submit documents sufficient to prove their academic status (it is reported that documents such as student ID cards, transcripts, and notices can be used), as well as two 4-inch photos of themselves, to the bureau from the 24th of this month to the 15th of August to apply for registration. Those who have been reviewed by the bureau and found to be on file will be arranged in order. Such strict regulations will eliminate the abuse of power. After completing this registration, students no longer need to register with the school, which can save the cost of registration. Furthermore, in the future, transferring schools will be much more convenient than applying on their own. In addition, the bureau also stipulates that female students who should be entering the first grade of senior or junior high school should go directly to private girls' middle schools in the city to register according to the school's registration date. The Social Bureau's announcement and the locations of various municipal private girls' middle schools in this city are recorded below to guide the studies and further education of each female student.</p>

<p>The 15th Annual Meeting of the Vocational Education Society is Held at the Same Time</p>
<p>Chairman Wang Zhengting Reports; Chu Minyi Delivers a Speech</p>
<p>(Qingdao Correspondence) The 15th Annual Meeting of the China Vocational Education Society and the 13th National Vocational Education Discussion Meeting were held simultaneously at 9 a.m. on the 19th of this month in the auditorium of the Municipal Girls' Middle School on Taiping Road in this city. A total of 206 male and female members from various provinces and cities attended the meeting. Chairman Wang Zhengyan gave an opening speech. The meeting lasted for three days. The detailed situation is recorded below:</p>
<p>Grand Opening Scene Around 9 a.m. on this day, all male and female members arrived on time. The guests who attended included Chu Minyi, Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan; Gu Shusen, representative of the Ministry of Education; He Siyuan, representative of the Shandong Provincial Government; Mayor Shen Honglie; Hu Jiafeng, Secretary-General of the Municipal Government; Chu Zhen, Director of the Social Bureau; Lei Fazhang, Director of the Education Bureau; Ge Futing, Chairman of the Jiaoji Railway Committee; Committee Member Lu Bianneng; and reporters from newspapers, totaling more than 206 people. After the ceremony began, Chairman Wang Zhengting gave an opening speech, followed by a speech by Secretary-General Chu. Then, Jiang Hengyuan of the Presidium reported, followed by speeches by Gu Shusen, representative of the Ministry of Education, Mayor Shen Honglie, and He Siyuan, representative of the Shandong Provincial Government. After the speeches, Huang Yanpei of the Presidium gave a reply. The ceremony was completed, and it was already past 11 a.m. The meeting was adjourned, and the meeting continued at 2 p.m. to discuss various proposals.</p>
<p>Chairman's Opening Speech Chairman Wang Zhengting said briefly that today is the opening of the 15th Annual Meeting of the China Vocational Education Society, and the 13th National Vocational Education Conference is being held at the same time. It is a rare opportunity for colleagues from all over the world to study and discuss with each other. First of all, we should thank Mayor Shen and the gentlemen who are in charge of the preparations here, as well as the many comrades who have warmly supported us. The reason why this year's annual meeting was decided to be held here is that Qingdao has made progress in local construction and the climate is cool. At the same time, vocational education is very developed in all aspects, which can provide us with a lot of observation and reference. This is very memorable. We have carefully reviewed the past education, and there are two major mistakes: one is from top to bottom, and the goal is to pay attention to universities, from universities to middle schools to primary schools, and to neglect primary school education. We must know that the foundation of a country lies in primary schools. Taking Russia as an example, how its political economy and other facilities are is another issue, but its efforts in general education are admirable. Sixteen years ago, illiteracy accounted for eight-tenths of the population. After the joint efforts of the people and the government, the number of illiterate people has now been reduced to two-tenths. In the future, we must promote the work of popularizing education from the lower levels to the upper levels. This kind of foundation is very important. The second is to focus on using the brain and ignore using the hands. The hands and brain cannot be unified and cannot be given equal importance. This is a major mistake. In the future, we should try to correct this shortcoming and pay attention to implementation, especially in physics and chemistry. Education must rely on government assistance and promotion. All vocational education societies must pay attention to the above two points, and under the guidance of the government, work together to promote and complete them.</p>
<p>Chu Minyi's Speech I came to Qingdao with President Wang, and it happened to be the annual meeting of the Vocational Education Society. I am very honored to be invited to participate. In recent years, the importance of vocational education has been gradually recognized by the Chinese people and promoted. After careful examination, education has no distinction between vocational and non-vocational. Whether it is liberal arts, science, philosophy, etc., they all contain the meaning of occupation. However, because people later paid too much attention to ideals and neglected the application of their hands, the source of this neglect has been around for a long time. Since the saying that those who labor with their minds govern others, and those who labour with their strength are governed by others, all occupations have been neglected. It must be known that in ancient times, there were no saints greater than Shennong and the Yellow Emperor. Both of them founded their countries on agriculture and industry, and they themselves were farmers and workers. Therefore, they were able to create everything and do great things. Nowadays, once you enter school, you are afraid of labour. Some people even think that studying is a way to get promoted. This is a big mistake. Even the current liberal arts, engineering, science, and medical subjects are mostly not what they have learned. And their level is stipulated to be above high school. Therefore, there are very few of these schools that belong to the United Industry. In the future, we should pay attention to establishing and promoting secondary vocational schools, and pay more attention to adapting to the environment and local conditions to avoid the blame of building cars behind closed doors. At present, the country's annual trade deficit is very large, and food, clothing, housing, and transportation all depend on foreigners. There are many dangers. How to increase production in the future should be paid special attention to. The results of your research and discussion on the improvement of vocational education will be discussed with the government, hoping that the government will adopt them and that vocational development and production will increase in the shortest possible time. The future is unlimited.</p>
<p>Jiang Hengyuan Reports There are about 500 members at this year's annual meeting. Due to the North China Incident and other reasons, as of now, there are 206 people who have registered, covering five cities and ten provinces. They have come from afar, from Guizhou in the south to Liaoning in the north, which makes people feel more courageous. The preparations have been enthusiastically supported by all sectors of Qingdao, which has taken a lot of effort. I am deeply grateful. Regarding the Society's undertakings, it can be divided into internal and external parts for a brief report. The Society focuses on research, and the investigation and editing items belong to it. Outside the Society is the experimental undertaking, and there are currently 30 affiliated institutions that are carrying out management. It is divided into three types: self-management, agency management, and cooperation. There are four categories of undertakings: (1) vocational school education; (2) vocational training education; (3) vocational guidance, etc.; (4) rural improvement. The future direction of efforts and advocacy can be divided into five points: (1) vocational school education, vocational training education, and vocational guidance should be developed equally; (2) for schools that have been established, the content of the school should be enriched and the way out for students should be broadened. For schools that have not been established, attention should be paid to adapting to social needs; (3) rural education should have a comprehensive rural improvement plan; (4) implement and promote women's domestic education; (5) pay attention to civic education, moral influence, especially pay attention to youth training. There are many proposals submitted by members this time, and there are also central issues for discussion. It is hoped that everyone will express their opinions as much as possible during the meeting.</p>
<p>Gu Shusen's Speech I originally attended the annual meeting as a member, but I was ordered by Minister Wang to represent the Ministry of Education to deliver a speech. Now, I will give a brief report on the Ministry of Education's past facilities for vocational education, the recent situation, and future plans. In 1933, the Ministry of Education investigated education in various provinces and found that there were too many middle schools and normal schools, and vocational schools accounted for less than one-tenth of the budget. Therefore, it was stipulated that the budget for middle schools should account for 40%, normal schools should account for 25%, and vocational schools should not be less than 35%. It is stipulated that this standard will be reached before 1937. Now, we are first seeking improvement in quality, not only seeking promotion in quantity, and hope to gradually achieve it. In 1932 and 1933, the Ministry promulgated two important regulations: (1) the Vocational School Law; (2) the Vocational School Regulations. Regarding the current program of vocational schools, there are several major revisions, such as internships and summer vacations, senior vocational schools are not limited to three years, and subjects can be established according to local needs. The Ministry of Education has made great efforts to promote and promote vocational education. From the spring of last year to the summer of this year, specialists have been sent to 15 provinces and cities to investigate vocational schools in great detail. The excellent ones are rewarded, and the slightly worse ones are guided and improved. The rewards are not only in writing, but also in material terms, that is, financial assistance. Special attention is paid to the difficulties of private vocational schools. Starting from 1935, it was decided to allocate special funds for application. More attention should be paid to vocational guidance, and specialists have been appointed in various provinces and cities to be responsible for promotion. Vocational guidance books have been published one after another, and will continue to be carried out in the future. Recently, the Ministry of Education plans to establish large-scale and very complete vocational schools in major cities in various provinces as models for general vocational schools. There will be at least one school in each province, and funds are being sought. In addition, special attention must be paid to production education, and more attention should be paid to production training for primary school students. Each primary school student is required to do a few production things. If each student can only produce one or half a yuan per year, the total number in the country is considerable. This is roughly the recent situation and future plans of the Ministry of Education for running vocational education.</p>
<p>First General Assembly The first general assembly was held at 2 p.m. the day after tomorrow, and all members attended. The report and the approved proposals are recorded below: (1) Report: A. 14 items that are requested to be adopted and implemented by the Ministry of Education; B. 7 items that are requested to be sent to the provincial and municipal governments and education departments for selection and implementation; C. 15 items to be handled by the Society; D. 2 items related to Society affairs; (2) Explanation: A. and B.

<p>The Shanghai Middle School and Physical Education Normal School Graduation Joint Examination for this year was held on the 24th, 25th, and 26th of last month for three days. The results were satisfactory and all results have been announced yesterday. According to statistics, the number of schools participating in the joint examination was 65 high schools, 89 junior high schools, and 5 physical education normal schools, for a total of 159 schools.

There were 144 high school make-up examinees and 80 junior high school make-up examinees, for a total of 4,954 people. As a result of the joint examination, 1,434 out of 1,870 high school students passed and were approved to graduate, accounting for 76.7%. 363 had to make up exams, 61 were held back, and 12 did not finish the exam. 2,224 out of 2,726 junior high school students passed and were approved to graduate, accounting for 81.5%. 434 had to make up exams, 59 were held back, and 9 did not finish the exam. 120 out of 134 physical education normal school students passed and were approved to graduate, accounting for 94.7%. 11 had to make up exams, 2 were held back, and 1 did not finish the exam.

<p>As for the students who should have participated in the joint examination this year, some were absent due to illness or other reasons, and some did not finish the exam. The schools should submit a request for leave, which is understandable. After deliberation by the Joint Examination Committee, it was decided to allow them to participate in the next joint examination to make up for it. However, the schools must still register and handle the matter to complete the procedures. Instructions have been issued to each school to comply with them.</p>

<p>The Chinese Economic Society was scheduled to hold its 12th Annual Meeting in Guangzhou starting on August 28th this year, as previously reported. It is now known that the Society recently received requests from a majority of members, who felt that it would be hot in Guangzhou at that time, and that the meeting was approaching soon, making it difficult to have enough time to prepare papers and to write them carefully, which would affect the number of attendees. Therefore, they unanimously advocated postponing the meeting. Yesterday, the Society specifically convened its 11th Council meeting to discuss the matter and agreed that the majority opinion should be followed. It was decided to reschedule the annual meeting to be held from December 26th to 29th this year, still in Guangzhou. This is because the members of the Society are either tied up with their duties or are university professors, and at that time, they can take advantage of the year-end vacation to gather in the famous city and discuss together.</p>

<h3 id="e151">Establishment of the Municipal Drama Research Association for the Revival of Spoken Drama Movement <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>Urgently Seeking to Improve Scripts and Train Talents, with Chen Dabe and Wang Zhongxian Taking Charge</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Education considers drama to be the most authoritative tool for promoting social education. Therefore, starting in 1933, Ding Shouye of the Bureau's Opera and Recording Review Committee was responsible for leading the city's entertainment circles to organize research associations separately, to seek improvements and achieve practical results. So far, the officially established associations include the Shanghai Comic Monologue Research Association, the Shanghai Shenqu Opera Research Association, the Shanghai Sutang Opera Research Association, the Shanghai Yongyu Society's Shanghai Storytelling Research Association, the Shanghai Siming Opera Research Association, and the Shanghai Pingci Pinghua Research Association, totaling more than ten groups. The Shanghai Spoken Drama Research Association held its inaugural meeting at the Municipal Public Education Center on Wenmiao Road at 10:00 AM yesterday. Director Pan of the Education Bureau originally intended to attend in person, but due to temporary official business, he sent Section Chief Jiang Jianbai to attend instead. Details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>More than 250 members attended the inaugural meeting, including Chen Dabe, Wang Zhongxian, Li Junpan, and Hu Hensheng. Huang Tiwen, representative of the Municipal Party Department, Jiang Jianbai, representative of the Education Bureau, and Ding Shoutang of the Opera and Recording Review Committee attended to provide guidance. The presidium consisted of Chen Dabe, Wang Zhongxian, Xu Zhuodai, Li Junpan, Hu Hensheng, Chen Wuwo, and Xu Hanmei. After formal salutations, Chairman Hu Hensheng reported on the preparatory process, followed by speeches by Huang Tiwen, representative of the Municipal Party Department, and Jiang Jianbai, representative of the Education Bureau. Ding Shoutang and Chen Dabe also delivered speeches. Subsequently, the charter was approved, proposals were discussed, and directors and supervisors were elected. The meeting adjourned without taking a group photo.</p>
<p>In his speech, Huang Tiwen, representative of the Municipal Party Department, stated that spoken drama groups are organizations that promote culture and social education. The spoken drama movement was once popular in the early Republic of China and was regarded as a new product of China, and was quite popular with the society. However, it gradually declined due to a lack of organization. Now that the Spoken Drama Research Association has been established, it should strive to research and improve in order to seek development. In his speech, Section Chief Jiang of the Education Bureau stated that there are many types of drama, but spoken drama has the greatest value. Unlike many other dramas whose wording is too deep or limited to locality, and cannot be understood by the public, its impact on society is therefore very large. He hoped that everyone can sincerely research and receptively accept the opinions of others so that spoken drama can develop. Regarding the source of materials, first, it must have a national spirit, and second, it must have a creative spirit. In his speech, Ding Shoutang expressed the hope that the materials for reforming dramas could be improved, and to cultivate one's own personality. In his speech, Chen Dabe expressed the hope that people in the spoken drama circles can be aware and clearly understand that spoken drama is not only for entertainment, but also has the significance of educating the people.</p>
<p>Discussion of Proposals: (1) Approval of the association charter; (2) All members shall pay a monthly contribution of 2%. Those who do not report will be penalized double once discovered; (3) Within five years, all groups are not allowed to recruit students. If recruitment is necessary, each person shall pay one hundred yuan to subsidize the association fee and be approved by the association for recruitment and training, and then introduced to various groups; (4) From now on, the stage scripts of all groups should be unified; (5) Those who perform spring dramas and Taoist dramas are allowed to join this association.</p>
<p>Elected Directors and Supervisors: Chen Dabe, Hu Hensheng, Gu Jianqiu, Xu Hanmei, Wu Yixiao, Zhu Yu'er, Li Zhuan, Wang Raoyou, Wang Tiexue, Wang Moto, Fang Tie Mei, Qin Zilong, Chen Wuwo, Wang Shaobai, Jiang Daier, and fifteen others were elected as directors. Zhang Siwei, Xu Limin, Gu Ya'er, Li Junzhi, Tang Wuseng, and five others were elected as alternate directors. Li Junpan, Qin Haha, Song Chiseng, Zhang Ye'er, Zhou Tianbei, Zhao Jingzhong, Dong Biesheng, and seven others were elected as supervisors. Yu Tiehun, Zhu Yizhen, Miao Yiyun, and three others were elected as alternate supervisors.</p>
<p>After the Dissolution of the National Language Unification Association, the Ministry of Education Established the National Language Promotion Committee, with the Address Still in Beiping and the Funding Undetermined, Wu Jingheng Appointed as Chairman</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education's National Language Unification Preparatory Committee was abolished at the end of June due to the central government's implementation of austerity measures in May of this year. However, the work of the national language still needs to be actively carried out. Last month, Li Jinxi and other members of the Standing Committee of the Association went to Beijing to discuss the matter in detail with Minister Wang Shijie and decided to establish the "National Language Promotion Committee". The address of the association is still in Beiping, and the funding is undetermined. However, the Ministry of Education will find ways to allocate funds for the work. The list of members is as follows: Wu Jingheng (Chairman), Qian Xuantong, Li Jinxi, Wang Yi, Chen Zhi, Wei Jiangong (all also serving as Standing Committee Members), Cai Yuanpei, Zhao Yuanren, Lin Yutang, Gu Jiegang, Hu Shi, Zhao Jialin, Dong Ya.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Chinese Stock Exchange, the market started rumors that were beneficial to the long party again. For a time, the bulls were excited, and the shorts were squeezed. The northern gang frequently covered shorts, and the trading market suddenly became a short squeeze. In fact, the rumors had been around for a long time, and the international situation was such that it could not be established in the short term. If it is raised again, it will turn into a bull squeeze, which is inevitable. The 96 public bonds have been rising continuously, and No. 53 still has a large number of purchases, and the value is very low, so it is easy to deal with, and it is not easy to fall sharply in the short term. It is heard that Sun Yungu and other holders of 96 bonds in Beiping are again requesting reorganization. No matter how much the interest rate is reduced or how long the principal is extended, it is intended to realize the second request made by various groups in 1932 when they discussed the reduction of interest rates, that is, to allocate funds to repay the 96 and two reorganized bonds that have not been repaid in principal and interest within three years. Yesterday's process was that the opening was uniformly rising, and the northern gang's buying was very strong. Numbers 35, 74, and 78 all had considerable purchases, and market prices were raised by 1-2 jiao to 6-7 jiao. It is said that the prices were raised to the front row market prices in preparation for the rear row to be released. At this time, the delivery is approaching, and rumors are rising in response to the market, but in the end, it should be transferred based on the relationship between supply and demand of chips. The market in the second market continued to rise, and continued to rise by about 2-3 jiao. The situation was still very firm. The market price results were that the meter rose by 3-4 jiao to 1 yuan less. The total number of transactions was 13.14 million yuan. The rise and fall results are compared and listed on the left.

<p>US and Indian Cotton Markets Fall, Bulls Spit Out</p>
<p>Far-Month Still Breaks into the 70 Yuan Range</p>
<p>The yarn market, which had risen for a week in a row, is now reacting and falling back. This situation is also expected. However, the current yarn sales market can still be maintained, and the chips in the warehouse have been greatly reduced, leaving only about 3,000 bales. Therefore, the cotton yarn itself is becoming more and more consolidated. However, the short position of foreign merchants is huge, and it is still not offset. Therefore, the far-month situation is more relaxed than the near-term. The future situation still depends on the actual sales.</p>
<p>Golden Rooster Fell by One and a Half Yuan Before the Spot Yarn Market Opened, Due to the Reaction and Fall After the Continuous Surge, Coupled with the Bulls Taking Profits, and the Decline in Foreign Cotton, All Months Tended to Fall, The Market Became More and More Loose, and the Far-Month Broke Through the 170 Yuan Mark Again, But the Current Yarn Roots are Still Tight, and the Sichuan Gang is Also Active, So a Part of the Reason is That the Stored Yarn in the Warehouse is Gradually Decreasing, and There is Not Much New Yarn Delivered, The Near-Month is Firmer, and the Far-Month is Weak, As a Result, This Month Fell 9 Jiao Compared with the Closing Price of the Previous Day, and the Far-Month Fell 1.3.4.5.6.

<p>After the cotton market rose, profit-takers closed out positions, causing a slight market decline. Some bullish investors released their holdings, leading to a loosening of the market. As for new cotton, due to declines in the Indian and American cotton markets, market sentiment was sluggish. However, most large holders remained unmoved. Current deliveries for this month are still insufficient. It is said that today is the deadline, and the inspection office has approved about 4,000 bales of cotton.</p>
<p>Zheng Biao (cotton yarn futures) also fell by a cent per bale at the pre-market opening. Near-month bullish forces remained strong, with high bids, but some took advantage of the rise to exit, causing the market to weaken. Distant-month new cotton suffered due to poor foreign cotton and sharp declines in Indian cotton, dampening market sentiment. In addition, bidding prices were also flat, and the yarn market also declined, causing the market to decline step by step. As a result, the prices for all months fell by 2.2 to 3.5 cents compared to the previous day's closing price. Sales included 3,000 bales from Taixing, 1,900 bales from Gengfeng, 4,200 bales from Changyu, 1,000 bales from Hengchang, 1,100 bales from Yuanfeng, 1,200 bales from Yongchang, 2,000 bales from Xincheng, 4,600 bales from Yuanxingchang, and 1,000 bales from Changhe.

<p>Foreign Wheat Prices Rise… Flooding Remains Severe</p>
<p>Yesterday's wheat futures market saw solid prices across all months after the morning opening. Improved foreign wheat prices boosted market confidence, and serious flooding in the Yellow River basin was expected to reduce domestic wheat production. Therefore, industry insiders were relatively bullish. Near-month contracts saw minimal gains due to physical inventory considerations, while distant-month contracts, from August onwards, rose by 0.3 to 0.5 cents. By the afternoon, prices began to fluctuate due to limited buying interest. The August contract actually fell by 0.2 cents, while others remained steady. Future stability depends on active flour sales. Ultimately, the current month rose by 0.1 cents, August remained unchanged, September and October rose by 0.2 cents, and November rose by 0.4 cents. The spot wheat market remained unchanged, with factories reporting smooth sales but difficulty increasing prices.

Shanfu Xinqu sold 5,000 bags, Shenda sold 3,000 bags, and Xinda sold 2,000 bags.</p>
<p>Chicago Wheat</p>
<p>Canadian Wheat</p>
<p>Flour Prices Improve Slightly Due to Short Covering</p>
<p>Yesterday's flour market remained stable. Foreign wheat from Chicago rose by about 0.3 to 0.4 dollars, and Canadian wheat rose by 0.04 dollars. At the opening, the current month saw limited gains of 0.005 cents due to rumors of confirmed foreign wheat orders in Tianjin at prices similar to previous reports, although the quantity was unknown. However, distant-month contracts improved slightly as foreign wheat prices rose and factories remained inactive. The lack of foreign wheat orders reduced selling pressure, leading to short covering and improved market sentiment. However, trading was still not very active. The outlook for the current month remains uncertain due to sluggish sales in North China and slightly high factory inventories. Ultimately, the current month rose by only 0.025 cents, August rose by 0.075 cents, September remained unchanged, October rose by 0.025 cents, November rose by 0.0125 cents, and December rose by 0.01 cents.</p>
<p>Limited Rice Inventory at Dujian River Leads to Price Increase, Good Sales of Foreign Rice Also Boost Prices</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sources of domestic rice (Shanghai South) were not abundant, totaling about ten suppliers (nearly 2,000 shi). Sales were active on the street, with North Gang buying two to three hundred bags. Both buyers preferred fresh, high-quality products. As a result, prices for high-quality Japonica and Indica rice rose slightly, while prices for medium-quality rice remained stable. Given the overall situation of decreasing daily arrivals and limited inventory in the Huangpu River, a decline in prices is unlikely. Yin Yuan remained stable, and Bian Yuan saw no market. (Shanghai North) Sources were from about ten routes. The opening price for high-quality Japonica rice was called up by 0.2 dollars, with continued spot trading leading to further price increases. Spot sales were slow, and the market rose by about 0.3 dollars compared to the previous price. Arrivals of early-season Indica rice were scarce, and spot sales were decent, with prices rising by 0.1 to 0.2 dollars. The inventory of Bai Yuanhe rice was low, and sales were brisk, with prices rising by 0.2 to 0.3 dollars. Other types of rice also increased by about 0.1 dollars.</p>
<p>Yesterday's foreign rice market was more active due to brisk sales. Market sentiment was also optimistic. Sales from the Yangtze River area were particularly active, with inquiries from Jiujiang, Hankou, and Nanjing. Local trading was limited, and Ningbo saw some activity. Sellers and domestic buyers were less eager to sell than before. As a result, prices for high-quality and secondary-quality rice rose by 0.05 to 0.1 dollars across the board. A total of 12,000 bags of Siam rice and 2,000 bags of Xiaojiao Siamese, Min Dang, Su Gengdi, etc. were sold throughout the day. Furthermore, Ke Xian rice has not been available for many days, and the market inventory has also been depleted. A new batch of Wenzhou rice arrived in Shanghai and was immediately purchased by domestic buyers for 200 bags at a price of 8.98 yuan, similar to the previous selling price.</p>
<h3 id="e161">Soybean Cake Plunges, Sales Active <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>Customer Warehouses and Goods in Transit Total 200,000 Pieces</p>
<p>Yesterday, the soybean cake market experienced unstable weather, leading to poor sales in the morning. In the afternoon, news of continuous price declines further dampened the market. Customer-owned soybean cakes were the first to drop in price, falling by 0.05 to 0.06 dollars compared to the previous market. Factory-owned soybean cakes also followed suit, falling by 0.03 to 0.04 dollars. The market was filled with a weak atmosphere. However, the sharp price drop attracted buyers from Shantou, so despite the weak prices, trading was still active. Statistics show that over 4,000 pieces of customer-owned soybean cake were traded, along with over 8,500 pieces of spot factory-owned soybean cake and 22,000 pieces of forward contract soybean cake. Factory-owned soybean cake prices did not fall as quickly as customer-owned soybean cake prices. Customer-owned soybean cake is not suitable for long-term storage due to its identity, so it is easily sold at a low price when sales are slow. Currently, customer-owned soybean cakes that have arrived at warehouses and are in transit total 200,000 pieces, so sellers are unwilling to hold onto them tightly.</p>

<p>—Cocoon Prices Also Rise to 20 Yuan—</p>
<p>The international market has long been bearish, so import companies have very little inventory. Current strong sales suggest a potential supply shortage. As a result, the New York market is unusually firm, and Yokohama and Lyon are also rising. B-grade white filature silk in Shanghai has also risen by a strong 50 yuan. Recently, dried cocoons have become even more popular, rising by about 20 yuan per bale. Based on the cost of cocoons, silk prices need to rise another 50 yuan to be profitable. Therefore, manufacturers without cocoons are feeling the pressure, leading some to stop selling and wait for an opportunity to profit. Yesterday's silk market remained firm.</p>
<p>Needle-Shaped Green Tea Sales in Europe Show Slight Improvement</p>
<p>Yesterday's green tea market remained stable. Yingzhuang, Tongfu, Fushi, and other companies are actively purchasing needle-shaped green tea from Wuyuan, Tunxi, and Shexian. Sales are more active than before. However, the opening price for high-grade Zhuang tea was 15-16 yuan, unchanged from before, while the opening price for low-grade Zhuang tea was only 13-14 yuan, down another 2-3 yuan compared to before. The situation in the Chunmee green tea market is still developing. Chinese tea merchants are uniformly optimistic due to the scarcity of sources. Yesterday, high-grade Chou Xin tea continued to be offered at 126 yuan. Based on the current market situation, tea with good body and strips is likely to continue to rise.</p>
<h3 id="e163">Sugar Market: Raw Sugar and White Sugar Rise Again by 5 Cents <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market continued to tighten as customs gold remained stable and foreign buyers were active. The public association set the initial price for spot 24-grade raw sugar and white sugar at 16.20 yuan, with 300 bags trading at 16.15 yuan. Re-export sugar was offered at 4.80 yuan but did not trade. Taikoo Sugar B Mark was offered at 17.50 yuan, up another 0.10 yuan. Zhenyu No. 1 refined sugar also rose by 0.10 yuan to 15.40 yuan, with some transactions. A Chao Gang company offered a newly arrived batch of about 100 bags of Qi white sugar at 13.60 to 13.50 yuan, and 200 bags of good quality Zheng Mian red sugar at 10.075 to 10.07 yuan, with prices slightly lower for lower quality. Dong White rose by 0.10 yuan, with J Mark at 16.40 yuan and N Mark at 16.20 yuan. Dong Red was also slightly tight, with an offer of 11 yuan but no trade.</p>

<p>Due to the poor harvest of new Jinshan branches this year, arrivals have been delayed. Yesterday, it was reported that Guang Gang companies have already shipped eight boxes to adorn the first market. However, the cost was too high, and a deal could not be reached. It is said that the stored Chen glutinous rice branches are offered at over 200 yuan, with retail prices around 180 yuan, a reverse situation.</p>

<p>Recent trading in large lead ingots has been inactive, but the Huangdan factories on this street have suddenly shown interest in buying, resulting in numerous transactions in recent days. It is estimated that over 400 ingots have been sold. Market conditions have created the expectation of a price increase. Foreign lead is estimated at 13.85 yuan per dan, up 0.10 yuan, and domestic lead is at 13.40 yuan, up 0.20 yuan. It is said that domestic lead transport has been disrupted due to flooding in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, boosting market sentiment. Further price increases are expected.</p>

<p>Watches and clocks, made on the same machine, with the same model number, style, and brand, sold from the same watch factory, can still be "fast or slow," accurate or inaccurate, just like people who come out of the same "mother's womb," with the same seven orifices, five senses, and bodies, but with differences in "intelligence" and "good and evil."</p>
<p>If a person in charge can first "discard" themselves, then whatever they do will not cause enmity or resentment, and they can do it perfectly and successfully. Furthermore, they should think in reverse: always make sure that if I ask someone to "swallow this iron bullet," I can also "earn it down" myself.</p>
<p>One pair of hands can only block out one sun. This is a wonderful metaphor for "those who engage in infighting." Large institutions, companies, and branches have dozens to hundreds of employees. One person only has one pair of hands and can only hold one position. How can they be like the Thousand-Hand Guanyin, using multiple hands to perform tasks? If you "squeeze out colleagues like maggots" and have all the positions "done by you" and all the salaries "taken by you," it would probably be impossible in reality!</p>
<h3 id="e167">A Special Account of the Maiden Voyage of the Da Da <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>— Jiping</p>
<p>These past few days have been truly stifling. Living in the bustling city and leading a weary life, I often think of going to the countryside to admire the emerald green fields and breathe in the fresh air. However, burdened by labor and commitments, how can you be carefree? Yesterday happened to be a Sunday, and Dr. Jianqiu and Mr. and Mrs. Yeyu came to visit. After chatting happily for a while, we decided to take a half-day trip. Some suggested bathing at the beach to benefit the body and mind, while others suggested a picnic in the park for a special flavor. I opened the Shen Bao, wanting to find a special place to go, and suddenly saw the news that the Da Da new ship was inviting guests for a maiden voyage to Wusong. Enjoying the cool breeze of the Huangpu River was just the way to escape the heat, so we finally reached a unanimous agreement. Immediately after lunch, we took a car to the Da Da pier to board.</p>
<p>The Da Da was built by the Great China Shipyard. Its exterior is very beautiful, and its interior is very luxurious. In less than an hour, over a thousand guests crowded out of the city, presumably expressing sympathy with us. At that moment, the ship was unmoored, and the crowd cheered. Music and explosions echoed each other, shaking the air of the 16th Pier! As the ship left Yangshupu, the hosts treated the guests with soda, beer, and refreshments, being extremely courteous. As we ate, we admired the scenery on both sides of the Huangpu River. Having not been to the countryside for a long time, we felt an extraordinary appreciation for the loveliness of the countryside. The ship sailed about ten miles out of Songkou, then turned back along the original route, taking three and a half hours, breaking the estimated four-hour record. During the return trip, we visited all parts of the ship and were deeply impressed by the scientific equipment and management implemented by Da Da, truly the crown of domestic river ships.</p>
<p>On the ship, we met General Manager Zhang Xiaoruo, who told us that Da Da Company has been striving for prosperity for thirty years, rising from setbacks and resurgence. He felt the difficulty of starting a business and the challenges of improvement. At a time when the domestic economy is in a panic, he built this new ship with a huge investment of 500,000 yuan, hoping to fulfill his long-cherished wish to continue the past and open up the future. Listening to his words reminded me of the former sage of Tonghai, Zhang Qian, who strongly advocated utilizing resources to benefit the people, creating industries, developing education, opening transportation, and organizing charitable deeds. His great spirit and achievements indeed made later generations feel solemn respect! How many people like Zhang Qian can be found in today's world?</p>

<p>In cities plagued by economic recession, making a living seems not to be an easy task, especially for small businesses that feel the difficulties. However, my neighbor Old Man Wei is an exception.</p>
<p>Old Man Wei is nearly fifty years old this year and in very good spirits. He says that my strong body is my asset. Three hundred and sixty-five days a year, he gets up at dawn every day. He doesn't have a fixed job. His job changes with the seasons. These days, he is peddling cold drinks suitable for this season, such as sour plum soup for two cents a cup, and sometimes ice cream or shaved ice for three cents a cup. Sliced watermelon is also naturally what he sells every year. Although these things are frowned upon by hygienists, he relies on them to get through the whole summer.</p>
<p>When the weather cools down, he sells "Suzhou Tender Lotus Root," or "White Lily," or "Water Chestnut." Sometimes, if he has more capital, he sells "Dazha Crabs." In short, he sells whatever has the highest profit margin. In winter, he always sells "Roasted Sweet Potatoes" at the alley entrance. In early spring, there is really nothing to sell, so he sells green vegetables. But in late spring, he sells small yellow croaker fish, or goes to the countryside to get willow branches and peach blossoms to sell and make money. And he is not willing to let go of the festivals such as the Dragon Boat Festival, Mid-Autumn Festival, and New Year.</p>
<p>His son, A Da, sells glutinous rice rolls. But besides selling glutinous rice rolls, he also sells zongzi in the spring, warm lotus root in the autumn, and glutinous rice balls in rice wine in the winter. In the summer, as usual, he gets rid of the glutinous rice roll bucket and turns it into a cold noodle stall, selling jelly and cold mung bean soup.</p>
<p>Although the father and son each have their own household and bear the burden of their families, their lives are quite comfortable.</p>

<h3 id="e169">Mummy <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>— (Wang Letian)</p>
<p>The West Lake Museum in Hangzhou recently displayed a mummy, attracting crowds of men, women, old, and young from Hangzhou to visit. Boatmen and rickshaw pullers have also changed their slogans, immediately saying to customers: "Sir! Going to see the mummy?"</p>
<p>I arrived in Hangzhou and happened to encounter this event, so I hired a boat with my older brother Mutian to go see it. Upon landing, we immediately saw that the inside and outside of the museum gate were extremely crowded. After signing our names, we proceeded to the room displaying animals. Before entering, we saw a display case surrounded by spectators, which contained the so-called mummy. The case was divided into two compartments. The upper compartment displayed the mummy's head, padded with absorbent cotton. We could see that the facial features had decomposed, and the back of the head had a hair bun with a gold hairpin inserted. Upon closer inspection, it was an old woman. The skull was ash-black in color, and its texture did not resemble human bone but rather mineral matter. Within the right eye socket, we vaguely saw what appeared to be an eyeball, no different from a dead fish's eye. The lower compartment contained a pair of the mummy's hands and feet. The feet were small, and the muscles had contracted, resembling boiled chicken or duck wings. The people of Hangzhou did not know the meaning of mummy, and rumors said that it was a zombie that had been defeated by the villagers.</p>

<p>Jiefu laughed: Not busy for the time being. These words probably stayed in Mr. Cheng's heart. Within six or seven days, brother will have a small position to announce. This is all thanks to Mr. Jia Duocai's eight-line flattery. When making friends outside, no one knows when they will be useful and when they will not, so it is always best to make as many friends as possible. For example, this Mr. Jia, I do not know him, but he was introduced by Mr. Li Shilian. However, the things that Mr. Li is trying to do do not have any news, and my things have a very good chance. Mr. Jia is extremely generous and does not lose the demeanor of a banker. In the future, when a branch bank is established in Xi'an, he will definitely be the branch manager. If Mr. Li stays in Xi'an for a longer period of time, I think there will always be a way. Zhiqian did not smoke cigarettes, so he had to learn to take a cigarette and smoke it. In this room, the noise turned into silence. Jiefu had no way to praise Mr. Jia any further. After thinking for a while, just as he was about to speak again, Miss Yang Wanhua passed by outside the window wearing a new green silk cheongsam. Jiefu immediately exclaimed, quite surprised. When Wanhua heard these words, she stood outside the window and stopped walking. Zhang Jiefu disregarded everything and quickly went out to greet her. Wanhua laughed: Mr. Zhang, I have decided to leave early tomorrow morning. What about the letter of introduction that you promised to write for me? Jiefu cupped his hands and laughed: I am really very sorry. I went to the Construction Department at six o'clock this morning. I came back for less than twenty minutes, received a call from the Finance Department, and I went to the Finance Department again. It just so happened that Chief Wang had something to do and invited the director to talk. (272)</p>

<p>Of course, they accused him of more serious things than these, but I can't remember many of them; however, they were generally of the same nature as these six, and it is not difficult to understand what kinds of crimes that Governor Lao committed! The first and second articles above were nothing more than accusing him of being good at exploiting the people's wealth for his own benefit, which of course was not anything particularly special; but the third article could not but make the author offer an explanation! Because in the eyes of people today, no matter who is the chairman, president, or minister, they can openly dine in restaurants and eateries in the market, which is not considered a loss of official status; but in the former Qing Dynasty, the situation was different. Generally, high-ranking officials were not accustomed to going to restaurants outside to drink and eat; needless to say, they could not go to brothels! At that time, people regarded restaurants as inferior places exclusively for ordinary people, and high-ranking officials paid particular attention to these small details, which were especially likely to attract attention; even the people who opened restaurants, if there was an official who often went to their place to eat and drink, no matter how much business he brought them, they would always discuss him first and point fingers at him. What was the reason for this? To put it bluntly, there is only one sentence. That is because these kinds of things were not common; especially because those high officials who ruled one side were in fact the representatives of the imperial court and could be said to be a part of the imperial court. They should respect themselves more and not casually rush into restaurants, causing people to look down on them. Not only would they lose their own dignity, but it would also affect the prestige of the imperial court. Therefore, this charge was obviously a very serious one! (372)</p>

<h3 id="e172">West Gate Past <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>— Shanghai News Agency</p>
<p>Shanghai News Agency has a plan to "take charge of the past of the four gates." Today, we announce that we will take charge of the West Gate.</p>
<p>When talking about the West Gate, we must start from outside the West Gate, even before Shanghai had a county seat; this is to say the "Huangjia Que" first.</p>
<p>Outside the current West Gate, there is a very famous Huangjia Guo Road. Speaking of this place, it should have been famous a long time ago. Originally, Huang Ming of the Yuan Dynasty lived here. His residence was called Xijiao Yequ Xuan, and people called him Mr. Xijiao. At that time, Shanghai did not yet have a county seat, but it had already established a county. The county government was exactly the center of the old site where the city was later built; therefore, Xijiao was equal to what was later called "outside the West Gate," and the name Huangjia Que came about precisely because Huang Ming lived in this place.</p>
<p>People who live near the West Gate have a convenient and picturesque place to go, just like those who live on Luban Road, North Sichuan Road, Jiaozhou Road... because they can regard the Temple of Confucius Park (i.e., the Shanghai Civic Education Center) as their own garden, just like Gujiazhai Park, Hongkou Park, Jiaozhou Park. Speaking of the Temple of Confucius, it is the former school palace. It probably has a deep connection with the West Gate. Although it moved from the East Gate to the West Gate, and then moved back again, it ended up still being in the West Gate. —In the first year of Yuanzhen (1295) of the Yuan Dynasty, the Shanghai County School was changed from a town school. It was originally in the East Gate. In the third year of Dazhi (1310), Qu Tingfa helped with the fields and moved it to the West Gate. In the first year of Yanyou (1314), County Magistrate Wang Gui moved it back to its old home. In this way, it passed through the Ming Dynasty, and then through the Qing Dynasty and the Six Dynasties. In the third year of Xianfeng (1853), on the fifth day of the eighth month, with a clap of thunder, the Small Swords Society occupied the county seat. Unlike the Manchu Qing official books that carried out anti-revolutionary propaganda, the Small Swords Society knew how to respect culture. Even though they were besieged by the Qing army and stubbornly defended the city, they were able to widely establish free schools to educate the people. On the other hand, after the Qing army gained control and entered the county seat, they burned the school palace to a crisp. After the war was pacified, the school palace was rebuilt, and this time it was located in the West Gate again. If this had not happened, the current Temple of Confucius Park would probably have given the greatest convenience to the people living in the East Gate, and we would have been chatting about it in "Taking Charge of the Past of the East Gate."</p>
<p>There is a Temple of Confucius inside the West Gate, which has become the center of Confucianism; outside the West Gate, there is a center of Taoism—that is, the Shanghai Baiyun Temple, with the front door on Fangxie Road and the back door on Zhaozhou Road, and the content is quite large. When it started in the eighth year of Guangxu (1882), it was originally a small Leizu Temple; after six years, it received the Taoist canon and, following the example of the Baiyun Temple in Beijing, was designated as a "Ten-Fang Jungle," and only then was the current name changed, and the scale became increasingly large.</p>
<p>Next to the Baiyun Temple is a famous church girls' school—the Bridgman Girls' School. Its naming is to commemorate the missionaries Bridgman and his wife. The two Bridgmams were missionaries of the American Congregational Church and came to Shanghai in the twenty-seventh year of Daoguang (1847) to preach.</p>
<p>Diagonally across from the Bridgman Girls' School is a famous church hospital—the Women and Children's Hospital, its original translated name is "Margaret Williamson Hospital." It was founded by the American Missionary Society missionary Luo Sinaide and was dedicated to diagnosing diseases for women and children, especially focusing on obstetrics. Ms. Williamson of New York heard about this and generously donated all of her decades of savings to this hospital. This is the reason why the Women and Children's Hospital was originally named. The Women and Children's Hospital was founded in the eleventh year of Guangxu (1885) of the Qing Dynasty, and held its 50th anniversary this year (1935) on May 11.</p>
<p>Arriving at the Women and Children's Hospital, if you walk a few steps east along Daji Road, you can return to Huangjia Que Road, which we mentioned at the beginning. If you go south into Shangwen Road, don't forget that it is the former Shangwen Gate (Little West Gate); if you go north into Zhaojia Road, don't forget that it is Yifeng Gate (Old West Gate). Okay, goodbye.</p>

<h3 id="e173">Idle Chats of Today <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>— Yi Feng</p>
<p>Recently, various publications often have a column called "Idle Chats and Casual Remarks." What is discussed in these columns is mostly headache-inducing material. Because of this, some people inevitably become anxious. Universities, not wanting to be left out, also start publications, also engage in "Idle Chats and Casual Remarks," also want to critique others, and quickly catch up.</p>
<p>Their criticisms, on the surface, still carry a bit of a gentlemanly and scholarly air. They don't seem to be openly scolding people, and their scheming is always roundabout. But clearly, after drinking and becoming tipsy, they gossip about Zhang San's strengths and Li Si's weaknesses, yet they pretend to be nonchalant, acting cultured and refined, engaging in gentle conversations and whispering, as if they have the demeanor of unrestrained scholars who dismiss everything with a laugh. Therefore, if they want to verbally attack someone, they don't show any hint of anger, because they have clearly stated that they are just chatting idly and making casual remarks. Isn't that very clear? Idle chats are unrestrained, talking about anything and everything, and casual remarks are just things that come to mind occasionally, whispering among themselves. How can anyone take it seriously? If you choose to believe it, then of course I am not responsible, because I am just expressing my feelings! That's all.</p>
<p>The method is cleverly deceptive, but unfortunately, the tail inevitably gets exposed in the end. For example, when they talk about how you aren't doing well and he isn't doing well either, then you have to ask who is doing well? Of course, it's only themselves. Although they don't say it explicitly, it's self-evident. The intention of the "talkers" is only this.</p>
<p>Secondly, their idle chats and casual remarks, because their purpose is to attack others or facts, are of course aimed at specific targets and are different from aimless rambling. Therefore, their tone and language are specifically directed at certain people. As a result, only certain people become their greatest enemies. As for bandits, thieves, and burglars, they are of no concern to them. Not only can they ignore them, but if it is beneficial to themselves, they might even collude with them for convenience. Such gentlemanly and scholarly behavior is truly breathtaking.</p>
<p>In the past, some people said that village gossip was not to be trusted, but now it seems that is not entirely true. Today, only the words of scholars are mostly completely false. Serious talk is not necessary to discuss, idle chats and casual remarks, have become ulterior motives. The above-mentioned kind of critique is one example.</p>
<p>Speaking of this, I am beginning to like village gossip. Because although it is vulgar and unsophisticated, it is still genuine, and although it is absurd, it is not concealed at all, so it is likable. But can you get even one percent of the truth from today's scholar's idle chats and casual remarks? Truly, Amen!</p>
<h3 id="e174">On "Personification" <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Jicong</p>
<p>Gorky once said: "We often hear, 'The wind is crying,' 'The wind is sobbing,' 'The moon shines thoughtfully,' 'The waves want to shake the rocks. Although the rocks frown slightly at the impact of the waves, they are not defeated by the waves,' 'Boots do not want to be worn by feet,' 'Glass is sweating profusely'—even though glass has no sweat glands."</p>
<p>"All of this is 'personification,' which is intended to make it easier for us to understand natural phenomena. Here, we are attributing our own human characteristics to everything we see."</p>
<p>Natsume Soseki, in his famous "Theory of Literature," classified "personification" as "projective language" and offered the following explanation:</p>
<p>"In my language, the most emotional aspects should naturally be attached to the most emotional beings, ourselves. Laughter and anger, for example, are both qualified to express the essence of emotional disasters. Therefore, things written in these languages will clearly and vividly convey emotional bonds and will naturally evoke a lively state. There is no doubt about this. Moreover, when explaining the phenomena of the universe, the standard is one's own individual. Matters surrounding oneself are all drawn to this center and decided by one's own emotions. In other words, we have a tendency to readily transfer our own emotions to understand other things. I will now tentatively call this projective language, meaning the means of projecting oneself to explain the outside world. So-called personification or Prosopopoeia should all be included in this."</p>
<p>"There are unexpectedly many examples of this grammar in the languages we habitually use in our daily lives. For example, 'rain feet crossing the river,' 'the whispers of leaves,' 'drawer handles.' In European languages, such as 'seam eyes,' 'hinges,' are all authentic projective language."</p>
<p>Both Gorky and Natsume Soseki's explanations are correct, but I have one more point to add here:</p>
<p>The so-called "personification" is the descriptive principle used by writers in their literary works to anthropomorphize natural phenomena. Because literature conveys human thoughts and feelings through vivid imagery, using expressions that describe human life phenomena to describe certain natural phenomena, thereby linking those natural phenomena with human life phenomena and with our thoughts and feelings, will inevitably enhance the ability to convey thoughts and feelings. For example, when describing that it is getting late, writing "Night comes from the distant mountains" (although night has no feet) will certainly be more interesting than writing "It is gradually getting dark."</p>
<p>We know that every writer inevitably expresses certain social thoughts and feelings in their works, and their depiction of natural phenomena is merely an attempt to strengthen the thoughts and feelings they express. Therefore, a writer's use of "personification" to describe natural phenomena, like their entire creative method, is determined by the content of the thoughts and feelings they want to express; it is conveyed through their worldview, their mood; it is not merely their baseless fantasy. For example, our great poet Li Bai, he liked to use "personification" to describe nature, but his method of description is always combined with his consciousness. Now, let's just take one of his poems at random—"Drinking Alone by Moonlight"—</p>
<p>"A pot of wine among the flowers, I drink alone, no kith or kin. I raise my cup to invite the bright moon, Facing my shadow, we become three people. The moon does not know how to drink, My shadow merely follows my body. I temporarily accompany the moon and shadow, Enjoying pleasure while we must. I sing, and the moon lingers, I dance, and my shadow scatters. When sober, we rejoice together, When drunk, we part ways. We forever form a friendship without emotion, Promising to meet again in the distant Milky Way."</p>
<p>This poem not only demonstrates Li Bai's ability to appropriately and skillfully apply "personification" to describe the scene of drinking alone by moonlight, but such a depiction enhances the artistic expressiveness of his feelings of loneliness and decadence revealed in this poem. If Li Bai's feelings of loneliness and decadence, and the poetic inspiration derived from them, stemmed from the decline of the aristocracy at the time, then his use of "personification" here is also linked to the sentiments of the declining aristocracy. Because only a declining group would feel lonely and need to leave reality and the crowd, "raising a cup to invite the bright moon" to dispel their sorrow and sadness.</p>
<p>Another example is Guo Moruo's "Vase," which also contains many natural phenomena that the author describes using "personification," for example:</p>
<p>"Plum blossoms, I thank you for your subtle feelings,</p>
<p>You bring back my youth.</p>
<p>The spring in my heart, long since dried up,</p>
<p>Bursts forth from my petrified chest."</p>
<p>In fact, plum blossoms are not affectionate girls, so where do their "subtle feelings" come from? They also have no hands or feet, so how can they "bring back" anything for anyone? However, his things, or rather, everything related to his lover, is "affectionate." Guo Moruo's "Vase" is a "love poem" about the love-above-all-else ideology of decadent petty bourgeois, and the feeling of love-above-all-else can be said to fill the entire poem. The plum blossom depicted here is a gift from the poet's lover, so in the poet's feeling, the plum blossom is very "affectionate." Thus, the plum blossom is personified. Such a depiction certainly enhances the passion expressed in the poem, and also enhances the feelings of love-above-all-else expressed by the author. Therefore, we can say that the "personification" used in "Vase" was determined by the author's contemporary petty bourgeois consciousness of love-above-all-else.</p>
<p>In short, the so-called "personification," like the general principles of describing scenes and expressing feelings, flows from the content expressed in the work; further, it is connected with the writer's thoughts and feelings, and with his worldview. As for appropriately applying this method to describe nature, it goes without saying that one must have imagination. But a rich imagination does not come from the sky; it is composed of rich life experiences and knowledge. Therefore, in the end, to appropriately apply "personification," one must have rich life experiences and a deep understanding of general social life. Because only by having a deep understanding of life can one combine and unify natural phenomena with life, and thus be able to use "personification" to describe nature. For example, the bright moon, in the feelings of the lonely and decadent Li Bai, is a drinking companion; in the feelings of a love poet, it is a beautiful girl; in the eyes of a thief who wants to steal in the dark, it may be a very annoying person... If you do not understand the lives and moods of these people, then when describing their lives and encountering the scene of a bright moon in the sky, you will not be able to appropriately use "personification" to describe it; this is a very obvious thing.</p>

<p>Third Uncle-grandfather told stories to the children, and they all loved him. I never saw Third Uncle-grandfather read books, but he had a belly full of stories - the stories in Third Uncle-grandfather's belly could not be carried away even with fifty loads. On summer nights, after dinner, the men and children would go to the threshing ground behind the house to enjoy the cool, and the children would surround Third Uncle-grandfather, asking him to tell stories. Third Uncle-grandfather's meal was often later, and if they waited impatiently, they would publicly appoint someone to go to Third Uncle-grandfather's house to see. When Third Uncle-grandfather came, the children immediately made a fuss, "Don't make noise, I just ate, the food is still in my throat, let me smoke a bit before telling the stories." After loading the yellow tobacco, the children lit it for him, one puff, two puffs, three puffs, and the stories followed the smoke. Stories from Journey to the West, Investiture of the Gods, Wu Song fighting the tiger, Kong Ming borrowing arrows, Xue Rengui breaking through Motian Ridge, these were all the stories that the children liked to hear. Sometimes he also told stories from Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio, which they liked to hear, but they were also afraid of encountering such ghosts, and they sat there without daring to move. Someone would go back to sleep alone, deliberately coughing a few times when passing through dark places, as if someone was following behind, desperately opening their legs to run.</p>
<p>Third Uncle-grandfather was a porter. I never met Third Uncle-grandfather's father, but it was said that he was also a porter. Third Uncle-grandfather, at the age of fourteen or fifteen, followed his father as a porter, thus inheriting the trade. When I knew him, Third Uncle-grandfather had been a porter for many years - yes, Third Uncle-grandfather often said that he saw me born, in the year that the river embankment collapsed, in the blink of an eye, I had grown so big. Third Uncle-grandfather was not a porter all year round, and there was not always work for porters all year round. Third Uncle-grandfather also farmed, Third Uncle-grandfather also had his own fields, near the well. According to Third Uncle-grandfather, the fields were "as big as the palm of your hand," which was practically as if he had no fields. During the busy farming season, after finishing his own field work, he also did odd jobs for others. Third Uncle-grandfather was strong and nimble, and he was fast at transplanting rice seedlings and harvesting rice, one person was worth two or three women, and the families with more fields competed to hire him. But Third Uncle-grandfather's wages were also twice as much as others, and they also had to buy him liquor to drink, otherwise, the work would definitely be less.</p>
<p>After handing over the cargo, returning from the city, sometimes there was pork hanging on the carrying pole, but it didn't happen often in a year. Later, when I grew older, I went to the gambling house with him many times, and only when he won would he be so generous. He usually lost more often than he won. He didn't care about losing money, and he said to me, "Gambling is either winning or losing, gambling, gambling, is about 'bo.' If you're sure to win, who would gamble with you?" When he won, it was "unexpected wealth," and he bought a lot of everything. If you told him not to buy too much, he would say, "Embarrassing, embarrassing, if you want to eat, eat enough, don't be such a small dog. What's the point of not eating the money you win? Keep it to build a house? If fate decrees that you'll get rich, you'll get rich, there's no use in being frugal if you're not destined to. A person works hard just to eat, count one day at a time. You didn't bring money when you were born, and you can't take it into the grave when you die, right?"</p>
<p>"Gambling! Gambling! Look at Third Uncle-grandfather, didn't he even gamble away his son?" The elders would admonish their children in this way. This refers to his second son, when he was seven years old, he said he would take him to the city, and he was never seen again. It was said that it was for gambling. It was said that the child was sold to a relative in a neighboring county. Later, Third Uncle-grandfather went to see him a few times, and the child had become white and fat, and he secretly called him "Dad." Many years later, I won some money, and we both ate our fill and got drunk. On the way home from the city, we talked intermittently, pulling and tugging, and somehow we got to that matter. I asked him, "It's not like you had many, just two sons, how could you bear to sell him to someone else?" "Ah, nephew, it's like cutting my heart out, am I not human? But where would I get the ability to raise him? If he stayed in my house, he would suffer from cold and hunger, it's better to let him be sold to someone else - he'll have good food, good clothes, and be able to read books. My father was a porter, I'm a porter, do you want him to be like me too?" He answered me like this. I didn't ask again, whether he sold his son because he lost money, or he lost the money he got from selling his son, I didn't know for sure.</p>
<p>Baoshan, Third Uncle-grandfather's eldest son, carried water and cooked in a store in the city. One year, Shan Cai, who used to be a cook at the elementary school, became a platoon leader and returned to the county in great style to recruit soldiers. This moved Baoshan's heart, and he said that he also wanted to be a soldier. Third Uncle-grandfather looked down on it, "Anything is good, but being a soldier - being a soldier is cheaper than a dog. I raised him, but he doesn't listen to me, let him do whatever he wants. He doesn't want to be a good person, he wants to be a bad person, let him suffer and he'll know." In the end, Baoshan and three other young men from the village followed the recruiting soldiers together.</p>
<p>For several days, Third Uncle-grandfather was not seen, and everyone was surprised. Someone said that they had seen him carrying goods to the city that day. Half a year later, he came back, sick, very thin, and very weak. He said that he had been captured by the army to be a porter, and he took the opportunity to escape, begging all the way back.</p>
<p>With his cousin presiding, Uncle Quanfeng and Uncle Ruiqing witnessing, the fields near the well were sold off to take care of his funeral. On a clear autumn afternoon, Third Uncle-grandfather was placed in the middle of the coffin, carried by two people. The people who had heard him tell stories, struck gongs, scattered paper money, and sent him to the mountains. There, lay his father, his mother, and his brothers. (The End)</p>

<p>— By German Storm, Translated by Chen Yin Zhi</p>
<p>"Late in the afternoon, we had already washed the clothes indoors, and we came to the yard, wanting to hang the clothes on the wooden stakes in the middle of the cemetery. Julie rolled up her clothes to mid-thigh, smoothed her black hair behind her ears, and carried the small wooden stool from one wooden stake to another. The old woman was dozing in the armchair; I, I am not tall, I can't help her!"</p>
<p>Speaking to this point, Lame Mary stood up to straighten her weak body for me to see.</p>
<p>"I was sitting on a big stone next to the clothes basket, watching the neighbor's coachman brush a golden chestnut horse. I have always liked horses, you know, my father was also a coachman. This was indeed a handsome animal; when it turned its head from the shadows to the sunlight, the fur shone like metal. But from the gorgeous ornaments on the horse's legs, I knew that this horse must not be the neighbor's rented horse. "Whose horse is this?" I asked Julie, who had just moved the small footstool next to the last wooden stake near me. "This horse?" she said, standing on tiptoe on the footstool to hang the clothes, "It belongs to that foreign university student, I don't know what his name is." I looked up at her, but she didn't turn her head, she was still hanging her clothes. I was getting impatient when I suddenly heard a voice behind me saying, "Miss Nali, forget it, it's already hung up!"</p>
<p>"I also saw how she let her arms fall down and quickly lowered the rolled-up clothes; when I turned my head, I only saw that noble, pale-faced youth standing in front of me, Nali didn't say a word and jumped down from the footstool to stand beside me. That young gentleman also just stood there, his eyes only on Nali, as if he had forgotten everything. "I've met a ghost!" I thought, so I casually said something about the golden chestnut horse, I kept talking until someone answered me; but unconsciously all three of us walked across the yard. The horse stomped the ground with its hooves and looked at its master with smart eyes. Nali stood beside the horse, stroking the smooth horse neck with her hand, showing a very envious look. "This horse is as tame as a sheep," the young gentleman said, "Miss Nali, would you like to ride for a while? There is also a woman's saddle hanging in the stable?" She shook her head; but I heard her breathing shorten, she was indeed emitting a happy glow. This Count understood her thoughts very well, because he gave a wink, and others put the saddle on the horse's back and installed a light bridle. Nali looked at the saddle, her eyes as if bewitched. But when the groom put the wooden step for mounting in front of her, the young gentleman moved the stool aside. "No need for this, John!" he shouted, and he naturally picked up the little girl with one hand. "Put your feet firmly in the palm of my hand!" he said, extending his other hand in front of her, while raising his head to gaze at her. Nali seemed to obey his orders, putting her small feet in the Count's hand. I saw the Count hesitate for a moment, but only for a moment, then he sent her onto the horse with a quick motion.</p>
<p>"She sat on the saddle, her face flustered, her eyes cast down, and patiently let him entangle the reins between his fingers. The horse shook its head and let out a long hiss. Its master stroked the silky mane a few times, then placed one hand on the saddle behind Nali's back, while the other hand held the bridle and slowly pulled the horse to circle the cemetery."</p>
<p>"I must say, these two young people were a perfect match; anyone who saw her like this would never have thought that this beautiful girl was just a seamstress, a tailor's daughter!"</p>
<p>"Soon she complained that the horse was not going fast enough. She waved her hand, and the horse began to trot, and the young gentleman let go and retreated to the grass. But he did not leave her for a moment, as the horse ran, he also circled with the whip; he was like crazy, his eyes constantly fixed on the little girl, from her black hair fluttering in the wind, to the small feet peeking out from under her clothes on the saddle. He sometimes shouted at her, and sometimes said a few words to the horse. The horse ran faster and faster, panting, waving its tail in the air. Nali simply didn't pay attention to this. She just sat there distracted, smiling at the young gentleman, her eyes fixed on him, as if he was supporting her on the saddle."</p>

<h3 id="e177">Saving Disaster Through Thrift <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>— Qiong Sheng</p>
<p>When the drought demon raged last year, our contemporary worthies said: After human disasters, comes natural disasters; it is roughly "good fortune never comes in pairs, but bad luck never comes alone," this year we have suffered both human disasters and natural disasters! From the coast of Guangdong in the south to the land of Shandong in the north, news reports came that the fragmented Chinese mainland was almost half submerged in water, and floods were rampant! Li, Fan, Yanshi, the entire cities were submerged, Yisha and other places were like swamps. More than one hundred disaster-stricken counties, millions of refugees, houses, fields, livestock, and people, were swept into the water and lost their lives, the exact number of which is unknown! If we are allowed to ignore the words "human affairs are not well managed," many "compassionate" people will surely scratch their heads and stomp their feet, beat their chests and weep, and shout, "Heaven does not pity us, sending down this great calamity!"</p>
<p>Compassion is certainly compassion, but this compassion still cannot break the shocking contrast between the wails of refugees, starving and waiting for death, on the one hand, and the cars, horses, clothing, and music, forgetting their worries, on the other. In the dance halls, one cannot hear the sounds of cannons from northern Shanghai, and in the air-conditioned rooms, how can one see the disaster victims crying for food? Truly, "if one were to treat people with benevolence, how could one go so far!"</p>
<p>However, "treat people as siblings, and regard all creatures as companions," as the ancients have taught. Moreover, we are all in the same boat, all descendants of the Yellow Emperor. Therefore, Mr. Ma Xiangbo, an old man of ninety-six, with this in mind, earnestly appealed, "May our countrymen look down and appreciate his sincerity": "Those who wear silk and wrap themselves in Shu brocade should think of the disaster victims who are naked and bare; those who drink fragrant liquor and eat rich food should think of the disaster victims who gnaw tree bark and chew grass roots; those who live in high halls and reside in mansions should think of the disaster victims who nest in treetops and live in earthen mounds; those who ride swift horses and drive jeweled carriages should think of the disaster victims who are submerged in floods and float on the surging waves," and "humbly presents the proposal of saving disaster through thrift to the countrymen." Of course, we also believe that dancing on eggs will inevitably lead to breakage. "If one were to treat people with benevolence," everyone would agree with this act of saving disaster through thrift. In particular, the phenomenon that Ma Xiangbo called "when the fields are full of starving people, I alone eat my fill; when everyone is sleeping in the open, I alone live in comfort," is truly unreasonable!</p>
<p>The reason why this unreasonable fact must be repeatedly mentioned to the people is not only to despise it, but also to be seriously vigilant! Because in recent years, there have been ladies who "dare not lag behind in patriotism," "saving the country through dancing," and "integrating patriotism with entertainment," which has been adopted by them as a great principle of "working together." We can predict that these gentlemen and ladies, while seeking pleasure, will raise this banner and fear that they will greatly express their compassion and carry out the "righteous deeds" of disaster relief!</p>
<p>Mr. Ma Xiangbo's movement to save disaster through thrift, I think, should not be a talisman for gentlemen and ladies to seek pleasure, and it should not help them make that kind of pleasure and "righteous deeds" "truly deserved," that is its meaning.</p>

<p>— Right and Wrong</p>
<p>Since leaving my hometown and living a vagrant life, though on the surface I deceive myself by saying how free and unfettered this life is, whenever I am sick or encounter adversity, I always yearn for the loveliness and warmth of home!</p>
<p>If I had a home, when I was sick, I wouldn't be abandoned in a corner alone, groaning and suffering. Even if I wanted to vent my grievances, who would listen to such disheartening words? Everyone else has a home that I don't! If I had a home, when I hit a wall, I wouldn't be weeping silently in a corner alone. You want to tell people about your grievances? People don't like to hear such unpleasant things; everyone else has a home that I don't!</p>
<p>But can I guarantee that I won't get sick, can I always float and sink in the sea of humanity as I wish? Eventually, there will be a time when my hair is full of white. At that time, home is even more lovely and precious. "Old age without a home" is the most tear-jerking phrase in my hometown!</p>
<p>I am already a middle-aged man nearing the end of my life. In this way, I spend half of my long days living a wandering life. Although in a corner of the world, I have a warm home, and I am the only son of a pampered child. Because of my departure, my father published the most moving words in the newspaper asking me to return. Every day I read the words of repentance called out from the depths of my father's heart. He has already felt the painful plea of "old age without a home." A warm home was deprived of its happiness because of that wanton stepmother. He couldn't even protect the only son of his previous wife, causing me to suffer such a fate in my youth. I deeply feel my father's pain, and I want to forget that humiliation and throw myself into his arms. But in reality, it will only make things worse. When I reappear in the home, perhaps my father's pain will be even greater. Let me sacrifice my own happiness so that my father can have a home in his old age!</p>
<p>But I am already middle-aged, and nearing the twilight of my life. Seeing the harmonious families of my friends, I am so envious that it stirs up a feeling of helpless annoyance. So, my friends either openly or secretly urge me to get married, but I always smile and don't answer.</p>
<p>I remember someone saying that a wife and a toilet are the main conditions for a home. To have a home, I naturally have to get married. But is marriage such an easy thing? A lonely stranger in a foreign land cannot have such extravagant hopes. When I was young, I had a love affair, but now I am left with only bitter memories.</p>
<p>According to news from my hometown, my father always thinks about his son who left home. I wish him longevity. One day, I will bring a pure heart and throw myself into my father's arms to repent. I belong to that "home"!</p>

<p>— Qi Yun</p>
<p>On a quiet summer night, the silent streets are bathed in water-like clear moonlight, and the dark blue sky, slightly bright, is inlaid with smiling stars. Wandering alone in the serene quiet of the night, my heart feels old.</p>
<p>Turning a corner, unexpectedly, lowering my head, I see my own stumbling, thin shadow. The closer it gets to the street lamp, the fainter it becomes, as if it is being swallowed by the listless light. My old heart is even more filled with a desolate mood.</p>
<p>The clear outline shown in the moonlight, but the thin shadow reflected by the listless street lamp, truly symbolizes my own melancholy and gloomy life!</p>
<p>Since I first stepped into the circle of life, it has been as if a lark has been locked in a cage. Never again will the so-called beautiful, happy days of spring arrive. Not only the fervent desires, hopes, and yearnings originally hidden in the hearts of young people, like reefs or embankments resisting the turbulent seawater, all turn into foam, quietly receding and disappearing; moreover, from then on, I am cut off from the kingdom of purity, innocence, and naivete, and helplessly, unwillingly, I step into another hell full of deceit, hypocrisy, and treachery. — All day long, I am buried in the bad atmosphere of merchants and businessmen, gritting my teeth and enduring the insidious, vicious, and oppressive behavior between people, and the laughter with hidden daggers.</p>
<p>But, I should learn the ways of life! — Because, the road of life, especially this journey from leaving the kingdom of childhood and entering society, is a rugged Sichuan path. — Cold eyes, discrimination, squeezing, being betrayed by others... these are the trials that are meant to be, how painful it is to be a person!</p>
<p>Therefore, I have now learned to be indifferent and silent.</p>
<p>My mind, which always loved romantic novels and movies, has also begun to change. Now, I only like to immerse myself in the bitterness of the world and experience more of the so-called "ways of the world."</p>
<p>Life, the demon that torments the passion of young people!</p>
<p>But, who can avoid life (the ugly factors of reality) and survive?</p>
<p>Ah, what a pitiful and admirable thing!</p>

<p>— Ye Fei</p>
<p>Clang clang clang! Clang clang clang! Clang… clang… clang…</p>
<p>——Everyone, hurry to the rescue! The east embankment of the southern village has been washed away by the flood!</p>
<p>The families in the village were awakened from their sleep. Everyone, hearing such a terrifying cry, Jin Gen and Uncle San De jumped out of bed without even putting on their clothes. They went to the door and saw groups of people flowing outside. The sound of gongs and the cries were constantly echoing in the village. The shouts of women and the cries of children shook the entire world.</p>
<p>The rain poured down as if it were being dumped, and a sense of complete submersion filled everyone's heart!</p>
<p>"Alas! The heavens are really killing and setting fires. If the east embankment collapses, will any of us in the entire village survive?" Old Lady A Qi mumbled, touching the wall as she walked.</p>
<p>"Flood, flood! I never thought there would be a flood here," Sister-in-law Ren Sheng rolled out of bed and opened the door to take a look. She saw countless torches flickering under the eaves, and many long shadows moving messily across the muddy ground, all rushing and shouting in a frantic manner.</p>
<p>Clang clang clang! Clang clang clang! Clang… clang… clang… clang…</p>
<p>——The more people, the better, hurry up! Please bring iron rakes, ropes, and poles!</p>
<p>The sound of feet treading through puddles mixed with the shouts, forming a chaotic scene. Groups of people surged towards the southern village.</p>
<p>"Uncle San De, hurry!"</p>
<p>"Jin Gen, why aren't you hurrying? The water is about to rush into the village!"</p>
<p>Everyone blamed each other, but there was nothing they could do except worry about each other.</p>
<p>The low-lying areas around the east embankment had completely turned into a swamp, and the water was still rising steadily. A stone tablet on the bank was submerged, and then water entered the Yuwang Temple. The embankment had long been washed away.</p>
<p>Although people were crowded together like ants, a few torches flickered under the corridor of the Yuwang Temple, illuminating the pale faces of everyone, adding a layer of tragic color. Everyone was soaked through like drowned chickens.</p>
<p>"Block it, block it quickly! If we let it rush in again, we won't be able to hold on!" Drunkard Jin You shouted desperately from the high bank on the right!</p>
<p>"Don't shout! First, saw pine trees to drive stakes, otherwise the mud and stones will be washed away."</p>
<p>"Stones, stones, quickly carry stones over here."</p>
<p>"Carry mud, quickly! Quickly! There's no time!"</p>
<p>Yellow mud and stones were thrown haphazardly towards the breach, but the force of the rushing water was very strong, so despite being piled up, it would all be washed away. Heads moved like waves under the heavy rain. Although it was already getting light, the rain still didn't stop, and the raging waves in the breach kept flowing inward, from one foot to one and a half feet, and then two feet...</p>
<p>The people doing the rescue were initially just able-bodied young men, but later even the elderly and many women, and even the larger children, went to help. They worked all night carrying mud and moving stones, and they were as exhausted as old silkworms. However, the滔滔 flood kept inundating the land. Before noon on the second day, the entire village had become an ocean. The furniture and belongings of many families were floating on the water. People climbed on trees or roofs to seek help, some crying, some shouting. Life was only on the line of death. There were also many floating corpses on the water.</p>
<h3 id="e181">Miao Women <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>— Especially</p>
<p>Starting from Sichuan, walking along the mountain roads of Sichuan and Guizhou, passing through the county town of Qijiang, and reaching the border of Guizhou. If you pay attention, soon you will know that the Universe people reside here, and maybe you can see a posture of Miao people's lives.</p>
<p>Indeed, Miao people are rarely seen in civilized cities, or it can simply be said that they do not exist. In order to live, they may be unwilling to go to other provinces to operate things, so here, in the mountain depressions, they have planted very deep roots.</p>
<p>Needless to say, the mountain depressions are very inconvenient for travelers. Without the tools of transportation, the outside air is blocked. Naturally, due to the trend of nature, a very obvious regression is presented, but the prosperity between capitals is constantly progressing. Because of this, no matter how difficult your mountain depression is, its civilization can still penetrate a little.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was a coincidence of opportunity? On the second day of entering Huangzhou, I discovered the activities of Miao women jumping and leaping before our eyes.</p>
<p>What kind of people are they? At first, I asked, with a surprised expression.</p>
<p>Miao people, said Zhang Futou. There are many here.</p>
<p>I didn't say anything more, but in terms of dress and language, it did give me a novel feeling, but this feeling soon subsided.</p>
<p>Some people say that small ethnic groups can be assimilated by large ethnic groups. For the sake of practical needs, there must be no interruption of exchanges between each other. In this way, gradually, from language habits to daily life, everything is changing from a distant distance to a close harmony. Although there are still some differences in clothing, there are also some who hide in the deep valleys where few people are seen, practicing self-enjoying cultivation and food.</p>
<p>Perhaps it is their unique character. In transactions, they are mostly handled by women. What they handle is mostly mobile peddling, from here to there, or calculating when there will be a "market."</p>
<p>Why not open a shop for more comfortable transactions? This is not that they don't want to, but they are bound by economic forces, and, dealing with sophisticated tactics with sincere experience, the result is a strong component of failure.</p>
<p>No matter where, in order to resist the invasion of depression, they are similarly being eroded. Here, panic whips their hearts. Some also abandon their families and are hired by others, and some go to collect natural products in the mountains that do not cost capital to carry to the market to peddle. If you are in the provincial capital, you can hear the cries of Miao women selling.</p>
<p>When summer is about to end, the mountain products are ripe and yellow. Then, listen:</p>
<p>—Buy it, big wild pears! (Note)</p>
<p>However, when summer has slipped past, and when the wild pear season has passed, you will never feel silence. Other words will crisply leap into your ears.</p>
<p>The clothes are all made of homespun cloth. Love of beauty is human nature. Some people add colors to the homespun cloth by printing, or weave patterns from cotton thread. The sleeves are so wide, like a monk's. The lower body wears a pleated skirt, the legs and feet are bare, and long cloth strips like soldiers' leggings are tied from below the knee to the ankle. The feet wear straw sandals, and the head is wrapped in a cloth ring. Some also insert a few silver hairpins into their hair. In this way, it is very sufficient to boast among them.</p>
<p>If possible, buying a little of their woven "Miao brocade" is very detailed.</p>
<p>In short, their physique is strong, their spirit is enduring, and they have the instinct to be self-reliant. Women who are influenced by the material civilization between cities cannot be compared.</p>
<p>Note: Wild pear, a kind of plant in the mountains, round and thorny, containing a sour taste.</p>

<h3 id="e182">Can a Widow Request Property Division? <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>Editor:</p>
<p>I have a younger sister who is twenty-one years old. She married a certain gentleman two years ago. Unexpectedly, a few months ago, the gentleman passed away due to illness. Her parents-in-law see that she is very young and has not had any children, so they strongly advocate that she remarry. Because of her love relationship with her deceased husband, she is reluctant to talk about the issue of remarriage for a while, so others do not actively persuade her to remarry. However, her deceased husband has several brothers, who have all married sisters-in-law. They see that my younger sister is young and often bully her, so there is a general inability to live together between the sisters-in-law. Now that her parents-in-law have not died, my younger sister still has support. If the two old people pass away, wouldn't her uncles and aunts-in-law bully her even more? At that time, she will be isolated and helpless, and my family is not wealthy, so her life will definitely be in danger. Therefore, she wants to request a property division before her parents-in-law die in order to seek future security. I don't know if a widow has the right to request property division from her in-laws? Can her uncles and aunts-in-law prevent it? Please give me an answer.</p>
<p>Respectfully,</p>
<p>Ge Changsheng</p>
<p>Editor's Note: Ge Jun's in-laws are able to break the old habits of ordinary people and think about the future happiness of their daughter-in-law after their son's death, and advise her to remarry. Their thinking is really admirable. As for his sister being reluctant to talk about remarriage for a while, that is also human nature. In the near future, there is no need to actively persuade her, so as not to cause her painful memories. We can only wait and see for opportunities to talk about it again.</p>
<p>The current laws stipulate that children may not request an analysis of their parents' property, but exceptions may be allowed in special circumstances. For example, "The relationship between a widow and her in-laws, or between a legitimate child and a stepmother, has become like strangers, and it is difficult to force them together, so they are allowed to separate their property and live separately." Now, Ge Jun's sister and her in-laws are certainly not in the "like strangers, it is difficult to force them together" degree; but if there is concrete evidence between uncles and aunts-in-law sufficient to prove that there is an urgent need for future life security, a request for property division can also be made.</p>
<p>According to the letter, her in-laws do not seem to have bad feelings towards her, so it is best to directly explain the difficulties to her in-laws and ask them to make the decision. I think they may have better ways to help her.</p>

<p>"Boat Girl" is a dialog singing sound film directed by Shen Xiling after "Homesickness", and has now been completely completed.</p>
<p>The story of "Boat Girl" depicts a girl who rows a boat in West Lake. She falls in love with a weaver, but their love is destroyed by a leisurely young man who enjoys the lake, who fulfills his own good dream, playing with her like a bird in a cage. Here, the author stands on the perspective of "human centrism" to make a painful cry for those insulted women.</p>
<p>The main actors in the film are Gao Zhanfei, Xu Lai, Sun Min, Mei Xi, etc. Lao Gao plays a worker here, which is perfect for his personality. In "Boat Girl", he clearly has an amazing performance. Xu Lai, Sun Min, Mei Xi, etc. also have new postures appearing. Director Shen Xiling has a new harvest that is even more advanced than "Homesickness".</p>

<p>After Wang Ying's lover Shi Chao died in the hospital, she began a new life, sacrificing herself for the country, and set off from Guangzhou, the source of the revolution, to join the Northern Expedition with the army. Zhou Bodong, who had a crush on her, also came to the station to see her off. The set of this scene is really interesting. Under the camera, the people in the train need to shake slightly. Set designer Zhang Yunqiao came up with the idea of mounting a train on a car. The carriages were crowded with male and female Northern Expedition soldiers. The lights were set up, and the pedestrians at the station were clamoring. The people inside the carriages shook slightly as the car slowly moved forward under the camera. Everyone said: "This kind of set is both light and realistic." It can be said that it has a unique style.</p>

<h3 id="e188">The Method of Cofferdam for Bridge Pier Construction <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>— Xiao Ang</p>
<p>The Qiantang River Bridge has been under construction for several months. The magnitude of the project is truly rare in the country. Xiao Ang took the opportunity of his internship in Hangzhou to meet with Engineer Zhang of the engineering office. That evening, a certain American bridge expert gave a public academic lecture, elaborating on the construction of caissons in great detail. After listening, Xiao Ang had the opportunity to see the construction site firsthand, gaining much knowledge. This is now described in detail below for public research.</p>
<p>The solidity of the bridge piers is crucial to the life of the entire bridge. While damage to the bridge body is relatively easy to repair, the collapse of the bridge piers means the end of the entire bridge. The method of pier construction varies depending on the location, taking into account the flow rate of the river, the structure of the riverbed, the depth of the water, and the judgment of the architects. Generally, it can be divided into three types:</p>
<p>(1) Cofferdam method - used for river depths of 15 feet or less;</p>
<p>(2) Pneumatic caisson method - used for depths of less than 110 feet;</p>
<p>(3) Deep excavation method - used when the river water is extremely deep. The cofferdam method is described below. The other two methods will be detailed in a separate article later.</p>
<p>The cofferdam method involves surrounding the pier construction site with an impermeable and solid dam on all four sides, and then pumping the water out of the dam using a water pump. The bridge piers are then built inside this dry dam. This method is inexpensive and easy to work with, but it is difficult to control the pressure and seepage of the river water, so it is generally not used in river depths of more than 15 feet. If steel sheet piles are driven on all four sides, the depth can be increased to 35 feet, but for safety reasons, this is rarely used. Moreover, if the river water level fluctuates unpredictably, this method becomes quite difficult. Depending on the materials used, cofferdams can be divided into the following:</p>
<p>(1) Earth cofferdam - This dam is made of soil. Because soil is not very strong and is very permeable, a large amount of soil is used and it occupies a large area. It is generally not used if there is no large source of soil nearby or if the river water is slightly deep and fast-flowing.</p>
<p>(2) Stone cofferdam - This dam is made of stacked rocks and coated with mud to prevent leakage through the gaps. This method is less expensive, as both work and materials are more economical.</p>
<p>(3) Sandbag cofferdam - This method uses sandbags stacked to form a cofferdam. The thickness depends on the depth of the water. Because sandbags are movable, it is considered convenient.</p>
<p>(4) Wooden cofferdam - The dam is made of wooden planks interlocked and driven into the riverbed. To prevent leakage between the seams, some use two layers, while others cover the seams with wooden strips. This method is only used if the riverbed is layered with soft material.</p>
<p>(5) Reinforced concrete cofferdam - This dam is constructed on the bank in two layers, inner and outer. It can be floated to the work site and sunk to the riverbed using heavy objects. The riverbed is covered with mud to seal the bottom to prevent seepage.</p>
<p>(6) Ice cofferdam - This method surrounds the river water with non-conductive materials in the shape of a cofferdam, and then uses a method to freeze the enclosed water. This method is the least expensive, but it is not easy to do well.</p>
<p>Building piers using the cofferdam method has many difficulties, such as when the sand layer of the riverbed is too thick, the dam foundation is not solid, spring water comes from the riverbed, preventing the water inside the dam from being completely pumped out, as well as unexpected tides and the collapse of the dam wall. These are all problems that the builders must solve at any time and in any place.</p>
<h3 id="e189">Tales of Architectural History (1) <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>— Buren</p>
<p>Before history began, there was no architecture in terms of mankind. The earliest houses were extremely crude and simple, made by gathering the most readily available materials in the easiest way. Huts made of branches, walls made of stones, cabins made of wood—such houses had no other meaning than to provide shelter from the wind and rain. Humans lived in such dwellings, which were almost indistinguishable from nests, for hundreds of thousands of years. Then, the Egyptians, whose civilization was developed, began to build houses that belonged to proper architectural forms. These houses were works that belonged only to humans and not to any other animals.</p>
<p>The Egyptians had many fine and easily workable stones suitable for building, and the climate was excellent, without frost, dew, or fog. Therefore, those buildings that have not been destroyed by human power still exist and are almost as perfect as when they were first built. The solidity and grandeur of these buildings make it impossible for later generations to destroy them. This was the original intention of the ancient Egyptian kings in building them in that way. What they most desired was to create immortal tombs in which to store their mummies. However, although the ancient Egyptian kings planned their tombs after death to be more elaborate than their residences when they were alive, there are still many relics of magnificent palaces and slightly grotesque and mysterious temples.</p>
<p>We believe that the tyrannical ancient Egyptian kings could never have created their massive monuments without a people full of obedience and tens of thousands of slaves and prisoners of war, because the tools and machines of the time were very simple, and there was no way to haul and place those huge and cumbersome stones except by relying on the strength of humans and animals. Indeed, without having to rely on the inscriptions on the buildings, we can infer very accurately from the buildings themselves what kind of society Egypt was at the time. The huge pillars of palaces and tombs still stand, serving as evidence of the lifestyle of the Egyptians at that time.</p>
<p>In Syria and Persia, grand temples were also being built. "Chaldean priests" observed celestial phenomena from the upper levels of these temples and predicted the future. Egyptian architecture used stone beams, while Syrian and Persian architecture added brick-built arcades and domes. Greek architecture, although not using arcades and domes, was evolved from these early experiments.</p>
<p>The earliest Greek architecture we know of was crude and robust, such as wooden temples that imitated stone temples. The early wooden temples decorated with bronze have long since collapsed. However, gradually, the Greeks became the most prominent architects, and their architects and sculptors were at least equal to any predecessors or successors.</p>
<p>The Acropolis of Athens (a lovely, tall temple citadel), mostly built in the 15th century BC, has always been and still is one of the wonders of the world. These multi-columned buildings made of honey-colored marble can be said to be perfect buildings. Their proportions, their patterns of light and shadow, the size and position of their columns, their inlays, their clean carvings—everything seems correct and appropriate.</p>
<h3 id="e190">From Architectural Art to Greek Temples (3) <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>— Sun Zongwen</p>
<p>——The Most Glorious Page in the History of World Architecture——</p>
<p>(II) Characteristics of Greek Temple Architecture</p>
<p>When discussing the characteristics of Greek temple architecture, we can divide them into several points. For the sake of brevity, it is roughly divided into (A) Orientation, (B) Roof, (C) Doors and Windows, (D) Capitals, (F) Stepped Stones, (E) Building Materials, etc. These are now described separately below:</p>
<p>(A) Orientation The most important factor in the construction of Greek temples is the "orientation issue." Because we know that the purpose of a temple is to be inhabited by a "god"; and the Greeks believed that gods had the closest relationship with natural objects, especially the sun, which was the most mysterious: therefore, the orientation of the temple had a close relationship with the sun. As everyone knows, the morning sun rises from the east and sets in the west. Therefore, when the Greeks built temples, the direction of the main entrance was often facing east. The entrance faces directly towards the shrine, the only reason being that the temple was to be inhabited by a god, and the sun in the world rises from the east. Therefore, when the Greek people went to the temple every morning to worship the gods, the light shone directly into the surroundings of the god because the eastward-facing entrance faced directly the shrine; the meaning of this being that people could see everything about the god very clearly and brightly. This refers to the Greek aspect. As for the temples in Egypt, their orientation was not based on the daytime sun, but on the constellations in the night sky as the standard. Although this does not fall within the scope of this article, for reference purposes, I will now briefly list several examples of various buildings whose orientation is based on the orientation of constellations, in order to see a glimpse of the relationship between "temples and orientation."</p>
<p>1. Between 5300 BC and 1850 BC, the temples of Egypt were built according to the light of Sirius rising, which could shine into the god's eyes in the sanctuary.</p>
<p>2. Temples in Eottu and other places in Egypt were mostly built according to the light of Canopus before sunrise, which could shine into the god's eyes in the sanctuary. Temples in Caruac and other places were built according to the light of Canopus at sunset, which could shine into the god's eyes.</p>
<p>3. The oldest temple of Dendera, around 7000 BC, was built facing the constellation Vega.</p>
<p>4. The Egyptians and Greeks often called Arcturus the "star of the temple," indicating an important target for seasonal changes.</p>
<p>From the four examples above, we can prove that the orientation of temple buildings has a very close relationship with the sun and constellations, so-called mysterious objects of nature!</p>
<p>(B) Roof There are many forms of Greek temple architecture. According to a famous Roman architect, there are about 13 types of plans for Greek temples. However, in general, the structure of the temple hall is roughly rectangular, surrounded by various capitals, with no windows on the left, right, or rear sides, and the front and rear parts are narrower than the two sides. The roofs of all temples are uniformly triangular, called a Pediment. On it, various commemorative patterns are carved with extremely exquisite techniques to embellish and decorate it. The external form of the roof is generally triangular, which is sufficient to express its true spirit, showing that its internal engineering structure is the same, and there is absolutely no trace of false decoration on it. From this, we can see a glimpse of the Greek people's national character of being non-hypocritical and not making falsehoods, and faithfully expressing themselves. This is revealed in the roof.</p>
<p>(C) Doors and Windows The unique feature of Greek temples in terms of architecture also lies in the issue of doors and windows; because the temple is never opened with windows on all sides (although later, the Temple of Apollo appeared, because the position of the shrine inside was not built in the center, but built on the side, and because the construction direction of the main entrance was facing north, so on the east side of the wall, a window was opened on the wall of the temple for the first time; in this way, the morning sunlight could shine directly onto the statue from the window. In this way, although there are temples with windows opened on the walls, they are ultimately a minority among the minority; it can also be said that they are exceptions.) It only opened a door on the eastward-facing wall for people to worship the gods; but, speaking of which, the issue of light in the hall becomes somewhat doubtful. Because the light shining in from the small entrance is definitely not enough for a large hall to control and use. Wouldn't the hall feel dark? However, we also believe that because the internal building materials mostly use luminescent substances such as marble, gold, silver, and gems; and the inside of the roof is probably paved entirely with marble slabs. Therefore, from this point, we can infer the possibility that there are no windows on all sides. There are also some people who advocate that there are windows opened on the roof; but we have no way to verify this from the excavated relics. Because the remains of the roof are rarely left to the present day, this question cannot be adequately proven, even until now.</p>
