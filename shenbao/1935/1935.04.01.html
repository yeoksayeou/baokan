<h3>推廣衛生教育之先决問題</h3>
<p>— 都</p>
<p>我國民族。夙以和平著稱。唯其渴求和平。寖成萎靡之勢。而平日體魄之缺乏鍛鍊。攝生之不合科學。尤為召致荏弱之總因。際茲物競日烈之世。視耽欲逐者所在皆是。若猶不及時振拔。一洗痼習。其不為砧爼之魚肉者幾希。政府當局。頻年厲行軍訓。由學生而公務員而市民。使有適當之矯正。意至善也。顧鍜鍊體魄為一事。倡導衛生又為一事。江者雖若劃分。而實相須相成。偏廢其一。於事猶為無濟。最近衛生署擬就各校設立健康敎委會。以謀衛生敎育之推廣。而國聯顧問斯丹巴博士亦積極進行改善衛生之設計。與中央民運會規定公民訓練綱要定期實施。適成互相呼應之局。如此兼程並進。淬厲以赴。振刷國魂。庶其有豸。</p>
<p>推廣衛生敎育一語。言之良易。而欲確收實效。其艱阻且十百倍於公民訓練之施行。蓋一為表面之運動。一為內心之改造。强制訓練。可以一紙命令行之。而推廣衛敎。則必期其本身之覺悟。以我國現狀而論。社會人士缺乏衛生意識者。至少當在百分之七十以上。若在內地窮鄉僻壞。且並觀念而無之。又遑論乎意識。以此而言推廣。不戛乎其難哉。且今茲衛生云者。逈不侔於古之所謂養生。昔人養生之目的在薪長生。今時衛生之主旨在競生存。長生為縱的方面圖自保。其意義為消極的。競存為橫的方面謀發展。其意義為積極的。明乎此。則知在推廣衛敎之過程中。吾人須以科學為依據。不能復襲舊日消極之見。凡病源之識別。疾疫之防免微菌之消滅。食物之檢騐。胥有賴於科學醫之指導與合作。科學醬乃隱然為推廣衛敎之中心人物矣。然科學醫在我國社會中。迄未能博得全民之信仰。則其進行推廣。自必更戚困難。故吾人以為推廣衛生敎育之先决問題。乃在如何使科學醫普逮於社會。</p>
<p>秤學醫之不能普逮於社會。半由反科學勢力之中梗。半由國人保守觀念之不易祛除。而一部分科學醫本身之未靖厥職。亦常足予反對者以藉口。而增厚保守之壘壁。如何補直已往而策來茲。管見所及撮述之為四點。</p>
<p>第一。知識分子應有確切之認識與協助在富於保守觀念之國人中。知識分子。頭腦此較明晰。易於適應環境。其自身對於科學醫之傾響。宜不復有疑翳。祇以私情友誼之牽。率猶多模稜兩可之持論。此在人情。原無足怪。惟念今日國勢之頹唐。欲求脫積弱之羈絆。寗能舍科學而他求。則自當為理制情。蟠然改團。對科學醫予以扶植與恊助。</p>
<p>第二。病家方面應有充分諒解與信念普通病家對於醫生。每易懷兩種矛盾之心理。方其蒞診之初。瞻仰之如神明。屬望之切直謂藥到卽可病除。兩次三次以後。未有瘳象。便斥棄之如土宜矣。殊不知病情複雜。非能一蹴而幾。綫有把握。已轉他人之手。則又何由冀某早愈。故病家必須記取。醫生於延攬之先。不妨審愼委託之後。宜加信任。勿以躁妄　亂之情緒。自貽無可追悔之憂戚。一切遵從醫生之囑咐。隨時提供參酌之資料。如此足以增進治療之效能。而免除無謂之隔閡。</p>
<p>第三。醫生本身應有切實之聯絡與努力處今日過渡時代之我國社會。醫家不僅負治療之責。且須宣誘導之力。接待病人之際。允宜以忠實之態度。盡委婉之曉喻。期能給予病人以良好印象。而藉以為流傳之資助。凡足以引起病人之反感者。皆應設法避免之。至若同業間之相與。更應切實聯絡。互為糾察。如於臨診上有需要共同研究之處。應不恤攻錯他山以求濟。如發覺同業中有不忠實或失態之處。卽設法予以糾正或裁制。勿於眞理之外存意偏袒。勿以個人利害故自矯飾。務使整個醫業。不至因一二人之不肯而引起外界之誤解。同時復能以加倍努力之貢獻。博致一般國民對於科學之信仰。</p>
<p>第四。行政機關應有嚴切之倡導與督促行政機關運用其固有權力。以從事於衛生事業之倡導。自不待言而。其淺易之著眼點。謂宜注意於公共醫務之管理。蓋一般在都市自設診所之醫生。因生活關係。取資不能無昂。貧病者卽難免有裏足之嘆。唯公家設立之醫院。收費低廢。堪為羣衆尾閭之洩。其接觸之機會旣多。所發生之影響自大。凡在此中任職之醫生。假令有一二不肯者。恃俸給有規定。竟輕率以從事。則其所生惡果。寗堪設想。當局對於此項醫生。自應嚴予甄別。優其俸給。明賦責任。厲定處分。藉免無意中造成羣衆對科學之離心力。而予推廣衛敎以更大之製肘。</p>
<p>要之。科學醫之亟須與全社會謀緬合。已成為時勢切迫之要求。為推廣衛敎立基礎。為削弱國勢下針砭。關鍵之大。寗容漠視。此吾人所以不憚喋喋而必欲正色為國人告者也。</p>

<h3>比參院通過　貨幣貶佱法案　齊倫內閣地位鞏固</h3>
<p>比京　參議院頃以一百十票對二十票十九票棄權、表示信任齊倫政府、通過貨幣貶值法案、並在財政以特別權力賦予政府、社會黨及天主敎黨議員皆贊成政府、自由黨議員態度不一、（三十日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>比京　齊倫內閣所提貨幣貶價法案、經國會通過後、政府决將國幣貝爾格之黃金比價貶低百分之二十八、並對於物價之過分增漲將予抑制、又若有人利用時機操縱市面、則亦將嚴加制裁、證券交易所前經奉令暫停營業、將於明日開始復業、匯兌統制亦卽開始實行、並以减低百分之二十八以後之幣價為匯兌標準、政府頃並宣佈刻下外國需求比國證券為數甚鉅去、（三十一日哈九斯電）</p>
<p>比京　參議院昨日通過貨幣貶價法案、可認齊倫總理個人之勝利、緣參院對於此舉、原來反對甚力也、據聞齊氏鑒於衆院昨日表决此案時、天主敎黨半數及自由黨大多數議員、皆投票反對、至為灰心、因而有退避賢路之意、嗣由各要人尤其是國王利奧波得三世加以勸止、始乃打銷辭意、茲旣在參議院獲得勝利、則其地位愈形鞏固矣、（三十一日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>瑪德里　柴摩拉總統决命勒樂組織新閣、似為左傾之表示、因糖統已給與勒氏極廣泛之範圍、於必要時得延攬左派入閣、此舉將形成一種新共和派之陣綫、惟無論如何、在國會中不能佔極大多數、蓋大槪社會黨將採取中立態度也、（三十日國民電）</p>
<p>瑪德里　西班牙政界耆宿激進黨領袖勒樂、今日已接受柴摩拉總統之命令、組織新閣、勒氏曾屢任總理、此次大槪將組織混合內閣、而保留前閣中本黨閣員數人云、（三十日與民電）</p>
<h3>齊泊林飛船　南美飛行成績　歷百萬基羅米突航程　二十四倍於地球周圍　任何氣候均不受障礙</h3>
<p>國民社柏林通訊　「齊泊林伯爵飛船、於去年十二月十八日由南美作聖誕節之飛航、經法國繞回德國、共計已飛一百萬基羅粎、因此時人稱之「空中百萬財產人同航者有十八人、該船已能飛一百萬基羅粎之航程、故卽等於「空中百萬財產人」無異、此一百萬航程之光榮紀錄、現今世界各國之飛機或飛船無能及之者、其數近江十四倍之地球周圓、「齊泊林伯爵」號、經六年之努力、始有今日圓滿之成績、此種成績業於飛航事業、有象徵的意義、吾人以為LEIAF號飛船亦已受「齊泊林伯爵」號之洗禮、齊泊林老伯爵美巧的理想之命運、亦與其飛船之命運互相聯繋、因此吾人可以判明齊泊林之將來矣、一百萬基羅粎乃齊泊林之理想最得意之勝利、同時此舉亦卽是吾人不屇不撓的意志、及不倦的精神之表現、自一九二八年十月十二日「齊泊林伯爵」號飛船其飛航任務達到後、已為第一太平洋飛船所要求之飛航數目、最好之證據、據漢堡達美利堅綫關於飛船搭客及裝運之統計、該叚共有航線四二三次、並約有九十次橫渡海洋綫、每一航次、需時八·八一五小時、可搭二七·七零零旅客、五百五十萬餘郵件、並載貨四萬二千公斤、可保毫無危險、</p>
<p>若吾人試一回憶齊泊林伯爵號飛船之成績、則吾人可以肯定飛船及其駕駛人員等、於富有才幹的艾根的博士領導之下、其關於開拓勞務所發表之言論的眞意義矣、猶憶一九二八年十月問首次飛往北美、及一九二九年八月間世界最著名之飛航、一九三一年七月往北極之探險、諸如此事、皆為齊泊林飛船之事蹟、惜今已為人所遺忘矣、再者吾人猶憶有歷史價值之一九三年三月二十日之事、德國飛船竟能造成新紀綠、而入於發展之大道、能為兩大陸之航空交通事業開關南大西洋之航綫、齊泊林之飛航有確信之保險、定期之飛航時問準確、雖一分一秒亦不致有所遺誤、無論任何風向、任何天氣、及一切天文氣候之困難、均與齊泊之飛行毫無關係、仍可按常飛行、由於力德立海港至皮爾南布哥之航線、本來共需時七十二小時、且多次改良將時間縮短、因德國之第一次太平洋航空聯運、比之前者已可省時百分之七五、則興北美之經濟互相關和、期與德國對外貿易為益甚大、</p>
<p>吾人對於國際飛船、交通之信心漸次滋長、漸有適應所要求之搭客數目之傾向、一九三一年平均每一次有旅客四人、而於一九三三年平均每次已增多旅客百分之九、今年則打破從前紀錄、「齊泊林伯爵」飛船巳有江十個鎗位、且航次又已增多、但仍不足供旅客之用、今旅客已日見增加、則其票價自可减低、一九二九年渡洋飛船、每次票價為德幣八·四零零馬克、其間雖减至近百分之八五、然至今日由菲力德至港里可德耶納羅、僅售一·五零零馬克矣、</p>

<h3>英俄談話結果圓滿　艾登啓程赴華沙　俄請英在遠東方面　仍繼續其傳統任務　印度問題獲得妥恊</h3>
<p>（莫斯科）英掌璽大臣艾登自星期四日來此、與蘇俄外委李維諾夫等討論歐洲大局外、茲定今夜十時四十五分首途赴波蘭京城華沙、明晚九時三十分可抵該處、翌日將與波蘭陸長畢蘇資基上將會談、並將會晤波蘭外長貝克大佐、貝克定星期二日宴待艾登、聞艾登駐華沙時、將不舉行正式歡迎會、艾登此次蒞俄、衆覺其結果良佳、當在柏林會談時、問及二月三日英法公報中所述之各節德當局輒以「否」「或然」等語答之、今在此問及時、李維諾夫則恒以誠摯之態答曰「然」、艾登昨日侵晨赴距此三十哩之李維諾夫別墅、談至午後、始與李氏作別、歸英大使署時已鐘嗚五句矣、艾登旋赴文化中央俱樂部、卽號稱「赤軍之總家庭」者是也、今校英大使署將開宴會、繼將招待外交團人員蘇俄官員及外國新聞家、（卅一日路透電）</p>
<p>（莫斯科）蘇聯共產黨秘書史丹林與英國一掌璽大臣艾登、在距莫斯科四十公里地方外交委員李維諾夫別墅中秘密會談、談話性質至爲重要、據聞史丹林曾要求英國在遠東方而繼續擔任其傳統任務、卽在列國之間擔任調處任務、英國人士因蘇聯並未刺激英國、以反對日本而主張予以平等待遇、甚爲滿意、外傳艾登與李維諾夫曾考慮由英日俄三國締結遠東羅加諾條約、又傳蘇聯對於共產主義在英國屬地宣傳問題、曾向英國提出保證、此層由蘇聯方面予以否認、但英俄兩國關於印度問題、大約可成立一種協定、（三十日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（莫斯科）本日期午史丹林與艾登在李維諾夫別墅中會晤、其談話內容與其結果、蘇聯人士均緘口不言、僅謂經過情形仍極可樂觀、英蘇兩國主張在原則上並無參差之處、外傳蘇聯關於共產主義宣傳問題、已向英國提出保證、蘇俄方面雖加以否認、但此項問題必已談及、自屬事理之常、一般人以爲英俄兩國在印度邊境毘連地帶之相互關係、業已討論及之、蘇俄曾予英國以種種安慰、蘇聯某要人幷說明共產主義、目今形勢已非往昔可比、此際共產主義與全世界之關係、正與一九一四年之社會主義相同云、（三十日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>基本各點　意見一致</p>
<p>（莫斯科）英俄談話今日已經終結、最後一次係由艾登與李維諾夫在李氏別墅舉行、艾登係初次來俄、故除談話之外、尚往各處參觀、昨夜往劇塲觀演歌劇、入座之時、全塲觀衆皆高聲歡呼、並唱英國國歌、至兩國談話結果、則似對於基本各點、已完全同意、惟艾登亦曾屢次向報界聲明、此次談話亦與柏林談話相等、係屬採訪性質、俄方消息則稱蘇聯政府曾提出法俄捷克三國之互助計劃、請英國維持「善意的中立」、惟此間對於東歐公約之實現、則殊少希望云、（三十日國民電）</p>
<p>素抱疑忌　今始消釋</p>
<p>（莫斯科）英國掌璽臣大艾登來莫斯科時、擔任籌備事宜之蘇聯某外交官於今晨語哈瓦斯社代表、謂「艾登來俄、結果之佳竟出望外、此次英俄談話竟獲圓滿結果、其原因不外二者、一則艾登訪問柏林之結果、使彼瞭解蘇聯要人恐懼德國之嚴重威脅、非出無因、二則蘇聯在遠東方面之局勢、最近已大見緩和是也」、又艾登之一僚屬、頃向報界宣稱、謂「英俄兩國互相疑忌、歷十八年於茲、英國今乃始行認識蘇聯」云、惟英國方面人士仍謂艾登此行結果雖佳、範圍則仍屬有限、蓋艾登來莫斯科係採訪消息、而非舉行談判、其所得結論、英國內閣可加以追認、但亦可加以拒絕、艾登在莫斯科所計畫之一切、非經倫敦方面同意、仍不能發生效力、且英俄雙方意見之接近、大部分係由於「希特勒犯最嚴重之外交失策（此係艾登左右所作之語）之所致、解鈴還須繫鈴人、此後希特勒倘改變其强硬態度、則英國對蘇聯之妥協態度、亦未始不可改變也、（三十一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>蘇聯陸長　陳述見解</p>
<p>（莫斯科）英國掌璽大臣艾登、昨晚在英國駐俄大使館宴會中、與蘇聯陸軍人民委員伏波希洛夫會晤、伏氏曾向艾登有所陳述、按艾登在柏林時、希特勒曾語彼謂、「德國大多數城市、均未設堡壘、易遭攻陷、反之、蘇聯則擁有廣大之平原、使穗國砲彈失其效用、此二者不可同日而語云」、昨晚伏洛希洛夫之陳述、乃係間接答覆希特勒之論斷、證明蘇聯頜土亦易受德國之威脅、至於艾登及一般英國人士則均以爲蘇聯陸軍設備、僅係供防衛之用、俄國人民心理酷愛和平云、本日午後艾登尚將與法意兩國駐俄大使會晤、然後乘飛機前赴華沙、（三十一日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>解决日俄糾紛　俄議訂不侵約　歡迎英國居間調停　華府方面態度冷淡</h3>
<p>（倫敦）掌璽大臣艾登在莫斯科談話之結果、或可由英國居間、調停日俄兩國之糾紛、官塲方面謂蘇俄政府頗有歡迎英國調停之理由、日俄交涉雖仍將直接進行、惟外交界以爲如有第三者居間、則當能易於同意、蘇俄外長李維諾夫業已表示、俄國政府願與日本討論在「滿洲國」邊境設置非武裝區之計劃、且日俄兩國依照凱洛格公約原則、簽訂不侵條約之議、亦曾非正式討論、惟苟無英美參加、此項公約能否成立、殊爲疑問耳美國方面迄今對於此事尚拒絕考慮、國務總理赫爾亦無正式表示、（卅一日國民電）</p>
<h3>東京觀察　俄遠東政策轉和緩</h3>
<p>（東京）廣田外相近與蘇聯駐日大使優列尼夫氏作私人談論、關於確立日蘇兩國友誼關係之基礎、頗得到相當效果、中廣田外相極爲注意之日蘇「滿」三國國界糾紛調停委員會之設立案、蘇聯方面雖未表贊成、而要求確立彼此互不侵犯條約、以及友誼上之安全保障、但最近蘇聯因德國重整軍備、極爲驚愕、英國特使艾登氏與史太林李維諾夫在莫斯科會見之際、蘇聯首腦部人員均以爲此時應首先獲得遠東方面之安全保障、其希望現實之心至爲迫切、所謂不採取條約上之形式、此項主張亦不如從前之固執、事實上已漸趨和緩、廣田外相所提倡之糾紛調停委員會案、現亦表示慎重考慮、其態度頗形顯著、是以今後廣田外相與蘇聯大使之會談、在蘇聯此次變更外交政策上、當有新的進展、故於日蘇懸案之解决上頗饒興趣、實堪注目者也、（三十一日日聯電）</p>

<h3>英軍事學權威　論俄空軍力量</h3>
<p>（莫斯科）英國某要人、係極有權威之著名軍事專家、昨日向哈瓦斯社發表談話、略謂「蘇聯東方及西方邊境防禦工事、均異常鞏固、决難攻陷、卽就現在各國航空技術而論、欲炸毀蘇聯防禦工程、亦非咄嗟間所能辦到、蘇聯國防目的至目前爲止不外二者、一則防衛本國、以免他國之進攻、二則加入集體防衛、以共同向侵略國作戰是也、蘇聯之地理及軍略形勢、均適合於担任以上兩種任務、至就航空方面而論、俄國空軍設備極爲完善、於施行集體制裁時、足以担任重要之任務、不寗唯是、如戰爭一旦爆發、則現有之飛機實際上僅足供表面不甚重要之用途、蘇聯專家、業在其試騐室內、繪成稱完備之飛機圖樣、如鐵甲飛機、同溫層飛機·透平式空氣壓榨器等、如戰爭一旦開始、則將立卽按圖製造、用以代替現在之飛機、其戰鬥力殊可驚人、蘇聯不僅有衆多之飛機及飛機塲、且蘇聯之工業組織、可於最短時期內、將航空事業、煥然一新、職是之故、蘇聯支持戰爭之能力、必甚爲鉅大、凡此情形、德國知之甚讅、德國所以力謀使東歐互助公約不能成爲事實、卽因恐蘇聯加入集體制裁故也、今如使蘇聯孤立、不加入互助公約、則蘇聯本身、固有自衛之能力、未必受德國之挾制、一然因此不能使蘇聯担任保障歐洲秩序之主要任務、則殊爲可惜、反之、如令蘇聯加入互助公約、則一旦發生侵略行為、蘇聯軍力、可迅速出動、以向侵略國施行懲戒、彼蓄意侵略者、有鑒於此、自必有所畏憚、而不敢輕於啟寡矣云去、（三十一日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>（莫斯科）法文莫斯科日報社論稱、英國恒有一極幻想、以爲希特勒方面如以萬分溫和之方法、親爲勸說、必能令其放棄原定計劃、而於安全與和平之要求較能順從、而柏林談話已無疑的毀滅此項幻想矣、當英國閣員對希氏詢以願否與他國合作、以爲德國自身及其他國家保障和平增進安全之時、彼等所得答案爲「堅决之「不」字、則此項談話之結果、從此可知」、該報復稱、據稱希氏與英閣員談話時、詳述德國國社主義以反共骨幹爲其歷史任務之理論、此點完全可信、「唯吾人以爲各國報紙對於柏林談話之重要太事誇大、而以此種反蘇聯之激越論調、眞爲法西德國眞有立卽進攻蘇聯之可能老、夫希特勒氏固願接受反蘇聯之計劃、而以其爲整個侵略及擴張領土計劃之一部份、彼於談話中、並不掩飾其欲於東方發動、以實現其强制改變版圖之計劃、然此並非希氏之眞意也、吾人不應忘却、希氏並不能以相同之坦白態度、聲稱彼願先向法國捷克、（非常可能）或意國利益發難、德國當局之神智並未昏迷、彼等並未忘却歷史的客觀教訓、故彼等不願侵入蘇聯廣大之領土、以胃無上之危險、蓋蘇聯不僅現時有强大之軍備、且有無限之可能以改進並擴充其軍備焉、故在某種塲合、希氏或願以其他侵略對象入手、同時歐洲版圖之變更、必不自東方始、而必自西方始、吾人不能忘却穗國現有一部份人物、其力量與希特勒等、唯不如希氏之多言耳、彼等嫉恨法國與波蘭之甚、彼等所認爲至要者、唯復仇而已、「至於蘇聯彼於其戚受之危險完全了解、並已準備迎頭痛擊、蘇聯政府領袖之行動、乃以蘇聯實力爲基礎、彼等决不妄想一且有事、則全世界必能協助蘇聯、同時彼等不以防禦穗國之危險、爲其歐洲政策之中心、更不以爲蘇聯邊界爲全歐最易攻入之地帶、蘇聯輿論乃以更遠大更深刻之目光、考慮此等問題、照彼等之了解、德國之侵略乃全歐心坎之炸彈、此項炸彈得向任何方向爆炸、同時須以眞正有效之步驟阻止之、歐洲現遇一種難題、卽彼將加緊努力、以爲各國建立眞正安全、如是而令希特勒統治下之德國、與從冒險厲行其侵略企圖乎、抑長此紛亂、繼續加深局勢之不安以及戰爭之威脅、以令希特勒主義乘機完成其流血之準備、了無所阻乎、除此以外、別無解决途徑矣、」（卅一日塔斯電）</p>

<p>實業部長陳公博致訓詞云、今日中國酒精廠行開幕禮、本人是以賓客而兼行政上關係的兩重資格來參加、中國酒精廠的成立、不但是政府當局和公司當局認為愉快、亦是全國人民都應該愉快的事、今日有兩件事要談的、第一點、現中國實業的建設、可說本身都是問題、亟待政府與人民合力設法去解决、諸如農業方面、棉·麥·稻·絲·都急需設設法改進、至工業方面、無論輕工業和重工業、亦均同樣需要謀發展、而酒精廠就是工業中一個極重要的單位、因為牠和許多工業有着密切的關係、現在這一個工業單位、能吿解决、希望以後有關農工等的其他單位、亦都能逐步的解决、今日中國酒精廠的開幕、就可說是這一種計劃實現的開端、第二點要說的、便是中國酒精廠的成立、名義上雖屬官商合辦、但官股僅佔十分之一、而這十分之一的官股、亦祇是予以蘇浙間等地十年專營權和保護、作為代價、政府這種辦法、目的亦無非是在鼓勵工業的發展、將來完全商辦實業、也都保護、所以希望海外僑胞、能儘量以技術及資財來投資祖國辦實業、同時亦盼望國內同胞來共同努力、辦理工業初步的開始、當然須經過一番艱苦的奮鬥、諸如外貨推銷競爭、及價格低昂等問題、都要經過一番研究和計劃、祗要努力做出、並希望在座各位及全國同胞、予以協助、不難逐步達到成功的目的、今天兄弟謹祝中國酒精廠的發展、並預祝中國實業前途的發展云、</p>

<h3>點滴</h3>
<p>— （雲裳）</p>
<p>春寒料峭，春正來到，男子尙多棉衣，而女子却已盡是飄飄然的單旗袍了。在這一點看來，女子確是能够迎頭趕上，得風氣之最先的，而是一個時代的前驅者</p>
<p>春一來到了人間，於是又忙煞了一般公子哥兒們，他們鈎心鬥角的做着追逐異性的工作，大概和嗡嗡的蜜蜂在花叢中忙着做採蜜的工作一樣，都是為着「一年之計在於春」的一條格言吧。</p>
<p>有女懷春，吉士誘之。在春天裏，這種把戲似乎是層出不窮的。</p>
<p>春天是可愛的；但是在晚上，聽見猫兒的狂呌，蓋在身上的棉被嫌太熱，在床上翻來覆去睡不熟的時候，覺得春天又是可惡了。</p>
<h3>春陽</h3>
<p>— 世坤</p>
<p>春之神來了！太陽也好似隨着春神的降福；而換了本來面目。</p>
<p>它—春陽—用那慈祥的臉龐；柔軟的手腕；撫長了地上的小草。引出了樹頭的靑芽：更付與那一般靑年進取的精神；領導那靑年奮團的途徑。</p>
<p>啊！你是多麼偉大啊！</p>
<p>小草得了春陽的撫育；漸漸地長大了！脫去了枯黃的舊服；換上了簇新的碧綠衣裳；身兒裊裊地；似在感謝他的好意。</p>
<p>柳；軟着腰兒；穿着鮮綠的長衣；得意洋洋；消遙自得；不住地向那春陽行着最敬禮；並表示伊不願離別春陽；希望永遠地在一塊兒作樂。</p>
<p>靑年們！得了春陽的指示；努力地幹着工作；向那光明正大的路上行進。向那堅苦卓絕之中奮鬥；盡力地找他們的前程；啊！他們受着春陽多麼大的恩惠啊！</p>
<p>還有那許昆蟲鳥獸；它們受了嚴冬的支配；蟄居巢中，多麽厭悶；現在它們聽得大地上一切的新聲。知道時令又更新啦！氣象又轉變啦！於是爬出久居厭悶的巢穴；向那大自然的懷抱中；找求他們的新生活。</p>
<p>啊！春陽多麼偉大啊！他能喚醒世界上的一切。我希望你永遠留在世間。</p>
<h3>春雨</h3>
<p>— 周賢</p>
<p>春天的雨，老是那麼的像磨裏磨出來的細粉，會跟着輕的風兒飛舞着的。街上是泥濘得令人走着，眞有些兒不痛快，更其是汽車飛馳過去，泥濘給濺上衣服時，恨不得逃出都市，回進故鄉去。</p>
<p>不錯，在我的故鄉，有山，有水，有林木，有田疇。在這春雨像細粉般飄下來時，我只須推開了柴扉，便能望見籠罩在如烟如霧的春雨之下的天然景色。原野裏是一片的靑綠色，但是靑綠色的山，是給烟霧投的春雨，煊染得一層淡似一層，最淡的，僅存着一簇渺茫的靑灰色，眞像是一副天然的圖畫。</p>
<p>屋子前面的樹林裏的鳥聲，整天的啁啁啾啾地，噪一個不停。燕，在霧一般的春雨裏，不停的啣泥築巢兒。孩子們，赤裸着脚，在池塘裏捉蝌蚪。尾後的河裏，有時還送過一聲二聲的欵乃聲來，在雨天裏，也似乎有一種特殊的音韵</p>
<p>在田塍上走的，都戴起箬帽，穿着蓑衣，遠望着，幾乎辨別不出是農夫呢，還是漁翁，但走近來時，往往會得出乎意外的發現着是一個那麽壯碩的姑娘呢</p>
<p>但是，在都市裏，唔，一樣的是春雨，我所有的，只是一腔不快的情緒。</p>
<h3>公園的春色</h3>
<p>— 重樓</p>
<p>有人說：「都市裏是沒有春天的！」這話我覺得是「言過其實。」</p>
<p>譬如說：在都市的公園裏，我們至少就可以看見或找到一些春意。</p>
<p>為了探春，在一個晴朗明媚的朝晨，我和蝶瑜踏進了兆豐公園的門。</p>
<p>說我們去得很早吧，許多孩子們已經先到那裏了，他們在和暖的日光中跳躍着，在靑靑的草坪上歡舞着，他們眞是幸福的一羣喲。</p>
<p>因為管理得宜，園裏各處都開放着花，湖濱的楊柳也抽出嫩芽，湖中有多隻白鵝在水面上嬉戲着；還有小人國的帆船，在微波中給春風吹來吹去。</p>
<p>在假山旁的亭子上坐了一會，把帶來的留蘭香糖送到口裏細嚼，仰首望見有幾隻風箏在天空中搖曳着，像是很得意的樣子。</p>
<p>我給蝶瑜在盛開的桃花樹枝底下拍了兩張照片，這算是留作我們半日春遊的紀念。</p>
<p>下午，我又被碧君拉進了虹口公園。</p>
<p>在這裏看見的又是一種局面，這裏有許多男女健兒們，他們都是熱心於體育者；當然在這春天更是他們活躍的時期，於是園中大部分的地與，都為他們的足球，網球，棒球，……；這些球戲所佔領。</p>
<p>我們行過一個小溪，看見溪邊垂着幾根裝有機器的釣竿，我望了望那垂釣的人，心裏覺得很好笑，這樣一個淺而小的溪中，能有幾條小魚，何必要使用那機器的釣竿呢？這眞可說是「小題大做」呵。</p>
<p>聞着園裏的花香，聽着園裏的鳥語，心上感到舒適，臉上露出微笑，要不是夜幕已經拉下來，還不肯運然離去呢。</p>
<h3>江南的春天</h3>
<p>— 一葉</p>
<p>「我愛春天，我尤愛江南的春天，我愛江南，我更愛春天的江南。」記得很淸楚，這一段話是數年前我向一位南國的姑娘說的。那時，伊在探問着我到這兒來的感想。</p>
<p>這不是向女人討好的啦；實在江南的春天那種可愛的色彩太誘惑我了。不論是在山坡，原野，橋頭，河岸，總可以看得見：在柳綫上，草葉上，水面上暈染出一種醉人的綠色，這顏色彷彿是一片迷濛的綠海，這裏有少年人的心，愛悅的夢，孩童的天眞的笑，一支人生舞臺上的前奏曲。</p>
<p>我知道，春天什麼地方都有着，但是，要像江南的春天都未必有，也許是春之神特地在這兒多塗上一層綠色的顏料吧；最近，當我要從上海赴杭州的時候，一位敎師對我說：「你要多帶幾瓶粉綠的色油去，這時在西湖作畫，最用得着這種顏料。」他是不會騙我的，火車一過了龍華沿途都是我敎師要我帶來的畫料中的色彩，我用着得計時的心在微笑，火車也狂喜似的向着悠悠的綠海中奔去。</p>
<p>這時，想起英國的王爾德。這位愛綠的藝術家，他的天鵝絨的外衣，大的領帶，都是綠色的啦。他的「沙樂美」和「道靈格雷畫像」不都是含蓄着綠的意味，綠的情調麽？</p>
<p>唯美主義的色彩，在江南的春天中被我看到了；綠色的江南，藝術化的春天的江南……</p>
<h3>海雲洞之春</h3>
<p>— 汪放庵</p>
<p>陋室銘云：「山不在高，有仙則名，如果把這兩句話來銘之我們的超山，許是誰都認為恰當的。</p>
<p>這回；報慈寺外的宋梅，已將綠滿枝頭。閒來無事，在這桃李花開日，又給和暖的春風，把我吹上了海雲洞畔。</p>
<p>我深深地相信超山勝景，不獨梅花開時，香雪成海暗香浮動，蔚為大觀，在這春光絢爛的時候，如果登臨憑眺，也未嘗稍减逸興，如今，我一葉扁舟，獨個兒前去，當輕輕泛遇那激灧波光的丁山湖，回頭看不盡那可愛的迎人靑嶂，以至舍舟登陸，慢慢地爬上那海雲洞的山徑，此情此景，我眞的恍如身入畫圖，幾乎遺忘了這擾擾的人間也了。</p>
<p>海雲洞在超山山巓之東，乾元觀左側高處，就此而上，綴以石級，洞口寬廣如坪，蒼松翠竹，像一片綠雲似的披在上面，跑進洞去，你漸進就漸漸覺得陰鬱深邃，那早洞居上，上去綴有石級，雖然以前有人然炬入內，但終於不得其源而出。水洞臨下，也有石級可以下去，泉聲潺潺，隱約可聞。泉水流入乾元觀裏面小軒之前，就此滙為天然地沼，涓涓地都來自石隙之間，這裏更有嵯峨的怪石，像斷壁供笏一般。似乎令人覺有玉笋，瑙簪，跳珠鳴琴的狀况，此外還有明丁西軒父子及沈望雲石像，鏤石成屋，四面雕空，由此可見前代藝術的一斑</p>
<p>要是再讓我介紹，些關於海雲洞的歷史和文獻的話，那末，這裏曾經宋代趙忠獻建過黑龍五洞，這裏有宋時趙淸獻手筆，海雲洞三大字，石刻壁上，還有趙氏以及丁氏父子等石刻題詩，還有吳缶老的五言律句，摩崖在削立的巖上，還有乾元觀中藏着的文徵明書丁氏墓碑，劉蘭塑像，誰說不够人留連玩賞呢？</p>
<p>這些，眞够人挺憶念，海雲洞不置咧，然而，在這絢爛的春光中，我們還可以遠遠望見靑螺似的山峯，嫩綠的柳條，非紅的桃花，金黃色的菜畦，把環山隴畝，一一置在足底，何况，那錢塘海門，也如隱現眼前。呵！誰說超山勝處，不是海雲洞呢？明丁大武遊此記中云：「眞天開圖畫，令人如在靑霞洞天，又何必實履三島十洲，始稱仙境也哉」？這些，眞的描寫够了它的妙境。</p>
<p>朋友們，願你們在這絢蘭的春光中，不要這忘了那海雲洞之春。</p>
<h3>春的懷想曲</h3>
<p>— 陳亮</p>
<p>把那隻紫檀木的司必靈座椅移到洋臺上，在午後的輕鬆的氣流裏，浴着明潔溫暖的陽光，身邊有一隻矮几，一冊詩集，一壺雨前茶和一罐淡味的烟捲，那麽閒逸地坐着，有一股薰熱的氣息冉冉的打股間上升到脊樑，到面部的每個細胞裏，膨脹，膨脹，覺得暖烘烘的，是那種難以訴說的情意呵。</p>
<p>「三月裏來是淸明，桃花柳綠正當景」……這歌聲是打街面飄上來的，正想側耳細聽的時候，却又中止了。街上依然錯雜地走着各式各樣的人，那個賣地栗糕的又把一羣饞嘴的孩子吸引在身邊了，小臉兒有着興奮的色澤和光輝。有兩三個沒穿長外褂，露出大紅大綠的絨綫緊身。姑娘們的身子亦瘦下了，穿得多麼單薄呵，伊們的姿態是活潑的，臉蛋兒上貼着明媚的陽光。</p>
<p>夾在人叢中，「滴鈴滴鈴」衝出幾輛脚踏車，車頭或座後都綁着一點桃花和柳枝，粉紅和嫩綠，嫩綠和粉紅，這色調是含着强烈的刺激性的，它會使一個沉靜的人躁動起來，它會使孤獨者更反應出自己的單調，它會……它會促起生命重趨於活躍。不是嗎？那在車上踏着的人是那樣一副高興的神氣呢。「遊春歸來的人兒呵：他們把春色又帶到都市裏來了！」默默地，抽吸着淡味的烟捲，讀着詩集……可是，在春天，是多麽的無聊呢！</p>
<h3>春的讚美曲</h3>
<p>— 陳遵源</p>
<p>春到人間，照飛跑的日曆上所記業已來了好久。</p>
<p>然而，春在那裏？</p>
<p>有人說春在「楊柳梢頭」，有人說「春在梨花枝上」，也有人說「春在燕子的翅膀下」。春，究在那兒？這裏，只有聳立的方矩圖形的大建築，旣沒有楊柳，梨花，也沒有流浪人般的飛燕翩然蒞止，何處找春呢？</p>
<p>啊：有的，春蘊藏在女人的身上。瞧呀：街頭的女人，不是脫掉下了笨重的羔裘，挺高了酥胸，拖着飄飄的軟長袍在閒步兒走嗎？够醉人，够迷人呀，這春意，這女人身上的春意。</p>
<p>春，是值得人們的讚美。</p>
<p>春的風像是演奏着愛的曲調，會吹散人間的沈鬱，愁悶。春的雨像滋潤靑春之心的葡萄美酒，一滴滴會使人奮與，愉快。春是繼嚴冬而來，會援引人們從冰天雪地的深寒轉入和煦溫暖的氣候。萬物都從這時期萌育，人類的活動與食物也都從這時期開始獲得。俄國的盲詩人愛羅先珂說：「在每年裏，春天是最忙的時節，我們在春天所播種的，我們在收成的時候就可以收獲，全年的幸運在倚靠我們的春天的工作，饑荒缺乏以及一國的別的一切不幸的根也都在春天裏，人類歷史上的春天也是如此，每個新時代的春天工作，嚴密的决定全時代的發展的界限。」春對於一切的造就與失敗的關連有這麼的偉大呀！</p>

<h3>亞軍地位成問題　優游昨和西捕　上半時二比二下半時各無建樹　孫錦順頻失良機雙方均無精彩</h3>
<p>西聯足球甲組賽、昨日原有三塲、因前日申園發生意外事件、東華對英尼斯改期比賽、故昨日僅有二塲、為優游對西捕、與法商對臘克斯、分別在虹口公園第一及第二球塲舉行、茲分誌如左、</p>
<p>優游會和西捕</p>
<p>優游足球隊昨日戰西捕隊於虹口公園第一球塲、雙方實力至為半均、上半時成二比二、下半時各無建樹、結果以二與二成和局、昨日陽光普照、風和日暖、前往觀者、極為踴躍、約計可萬餘人、四周籬笆、均為坍倒、幸派有大批巡捕到塲維持、故秩序井然、</p>
<p>戰鼓方催　互得一球</p>
<p>鐘鳴三下、戰幕開展、西捕隊一路佔先、不五分鐘、優游孫錦順劉祖儒雙騎並進、被休說墨維二內衛被阻而退、但自此以後、球卽盤旋西捕之門不去、劉山儒窺得良好運球直入、合斯韜無法應付、　　　處、凱歌齊唱、優游以一比零佔勝、西捕亦不甘示弱、遂由前鋒諸將、挾球來犯、倍達神勇、鮑台振威、活根生烏特威輩、復為左輔右弼、是時優游門前、危機四伏、旋活根生借得角球之機會、一掃而入、張榮才雖堅如鐵門、亦難固疆域、遂成一與一和局、</p>
<p>彼此加宮　又成和局</p>
<p>嗣優游車整旗鼓、合力重征、孫錦順率諸將上前、以迅雷不及掩耳之方法、逕至門口、經吉勃生赫雷等救出險境、然而敵膽巳寒、不多時鍾勇森攫球傳與許文奎、許乘機向前、不費吹灰之力、輕撥脚顯、球應聲入網、萬衆歡呼聲中、優游又以二比一取勝、須臾、活根生邊疆發難、孤軍深入、疾馳優游門前、陸江兩將、急欲上前、則已不及、致被乘虛而入、成一一比一一、兩隊各自加官晋爵、又成和局、</p>
<p>下半時中　客客氣氣</p>
<p>至下半時開始、兩方陣綫、均缺少聯絡、確各有千狄、而以射球不準、無心戀戰、彼此客客氣氣、揖讓頻頻、毫無建樹、自三時五十五分戰至四時三刻、依舊各吃鴨蛋、裁判員鳴金收兵、乃以二比二成和局矣、</p>
<p>優游失機　殊為惋惜</p>
<p>約日兩隊球藝、平心而論、均未屆登峯造極之境、雖個人之表演、尙屬出色、然全綫之聯絡、殊欠訓練、而孫錦順是日不肯努力奔波、遂使良機頻失、上半時孫屢次射門、均相差毫厘、未得命中、下半時倍遂被罰十二碼、孫錦順主射、一般人以為此次西捕難逃浩刦、距孫鑯腿竟未湊效、碎然一蹴、球越綱而去、因之以和局終場、亞軍一席、遂成問題、</p>

<p>臘克斯勝法商</p>
<p>法商對臘克斯、昨日下午在釘口第二球塲交鋒、法商陣容零落、實力單薄、攻旣不能、守亦無方、致門戶洞開、臘克期遂得暢所欲為、以七比一大勝法商、</p>
<p>西聯甲組　最近成績</p>
<p>觀西聯足球會甲組最近成續、優游以二十一分榮居首席、東華自日昨之事發生後、西聯方面猶不知作何解决、至亞軍一席已成問題、藍優游昨日如勝可以坐得亞軍、今者旣成和局、則尙須亞軍、如一勝一負、則優游仍可居亞軍也、</p>

<h3>中華足球會中字組　真如戰和復旦　復旦僅十人作戰　結果三比三和局</h3>
<p>復旦曁南兩大學足球隊、昨在眞如作中華足球會中字組比賽、春光和煦、風和日麗中、觀者亦有二三千人、兩隊陣容、均不齊整、復旦關洵安缺席、並祗以十人應戰、暨南則以徐亨王甫珍等不到、實力亦减色不少、勢均力敵、棋逢敵手、曁南賴前鋒之聯絡、曾以三比一佔優、後以內衛疏漏、被復旦還敬二只、成三比三和局而散、裁判員何春輝、茲將中字組形勢、及昨戰經過分述如下、</p>
<p>隊名　已賽　勝　和　負　得分</p>
<p>維華　四次　四　〇　〇　八分</p>
<p>復旦　五次　三　一　一　七分</p>

<p>樂濟　七次　二　〇　五　四分</p>
<p>商船　六次　一　〇　五　二分</p>
<p>客軍先開紀錄</p>
<p>暨南開球、其勢汹汹、諸小將左衝右突、聯絡有方、鍾育祥一次猛射、橫木彈回、石永南對門還擊、一飛冲天、甚為可惜、復且乘勢追擊、前鋒雖祇四人、但攻勢不弱、余順章、楊榮華脚頭强硬、主隊吃驚不小、戰至二十分鐘時、復旦襲子文得安樂生之接濟、邊疆抄入、曁南陳春彥即起勤王、襲乃傳球與陸秀文、陸挑高送至門前、楊榮華趕上一脚、打入曁南門內、淸晣美觀、紀錄先開、接後復旦襲子文又遞一球、守門奔出撲空、幸楊榮華趕上稍遲一步、否則暨南又將不利、</p>
<p>主隊運中兩球</p>
<p>曁南陳鎭祥坐鎭中原、前接後濟、不稍怠懈、全軍立志收復失地、前鋒圍困客軍球門、左右夾攻、復旦顧此失彼、應付不暇、卒被丘振安從斜刺裏打中一球、造成平乎、復旦再度深入、龔子文闖入禁地、幸麥延琳機警、擋住龔之去路、球由守門救出、此後曁南攻勢極盛、鍾勇祥射門不中後、李省官高球窘敵、正對敵門落下、復旦門將顧得剛接得後、被蔡今才石永南衝入門內、曁南遂以二比一佔優、復旦在曁南門前二十碼處、罰兩次任意球、均未得利、</p>
<p>三比一佔優勢</p>
<p>上半時過後、復旦頗不得志、究以前鋒缺一人員、失一帮乎、力量單薄、而曁南小將、小派司十分出色、形勢成一面倒、復旦張容在罰球棧外、以乎拍球被罰、陳鎭祥高球挑至門去、鍾石二將乘勢追上、鍾頭頂攻門、被顧得剛托出門後、麥廷琳改任左冀、送出角球無效、三前鋒捲土重來、復旦後衛招顧不濟、又被湧入一球、三比一、曁南遙領前茅、</p>
<p>復旦造成和局</p>
<p>曁南前鋒聯終雖好、但脚頭甚軟、失去機會不少、論形勢、復旦勢孤力單、發展不易、但天有不測風雲、勝負不可預卜、復且一度深入、掙扎多時、曁南守門在門邊拾球踢出時、竟踢在面前復旦楊榮華脚上、而楊復在無意間將球一鐘、球竟彈入門內、意外奪得一功、喜出望外、曁南未免為之一餒、繼之、余順章孤軍奮鬥、獨闖敵營、又建一功、乃成三比三、曁南雖作最後之掙扎、力圖重見光明、無如幾次攻門、均在門柱上彈回、事不如意、無可奈何、和局而散、</p>

<h3>天津中華隊獲　國際愛羅鼎盃</h3>
<p>（天津三十一日電）津國際愛羅鼎盃足球决賽、三十一日下午二時四十分在英球場舉行、中華對俄僑、上半時一比零、下半時無勝負、總結果、一比零、中華隊勝、獲得錦標、該盃已輪賽三年、本年中華獲得、為一般未料及、</p>
<h3>市一體育場　工商足球閉幕賽</h3>

<p>活　郵工勝興泰　三比二</p>
<p>生　茂泰勝保險　二比一</p>
<p>基字組環戰成績、三民飛公兩隊最優、惟三民較飛公多得一分、昨日之交鋒、兩隊相值、三民即打和局、亦可執該組之牛耳、時屆十時三十分、戰士列陣、由張樂執行裁判、三民居順風、勞師無功、已損幾分銳氣、下半時、飛公由踢角球機會、打進一球、三民遭此挫折、陣綫散亂、軍心過激、而猛烈之舉動、失檢之行為、亦時有所見、幸裁判員執法如由、未肇事變、結果、三民再失一球、成〇與二之比、飛公遂獲該組錦標、論人村、三民內外平均、飛公强弱不齊、故觀衆預測、三民勝利、可操左券、奈戰士缺乏素養、致辜負辦理該隊者提倡體育之苦心、惜哉、</p>

<h3>注音漢字利弊問題　黎錦熙表示四項意見　對費時耗目力等有所解釋　對應先從事研究表示贊同</h3>
<p>（北平通訊）近日滬報載有陳鶴琴對於注音漢字之談話、略謂黎錦熙所主張民衆讀物及小學敎科書全數用注音漢字排印之計劃、恐有三種弊端、上海社記者因走訪黎氏、詢其意見據談如下</p>
<p>不費時間</p>
<p>（一）費時、注音漢字原為節省時間起見、生字注音、陳君已認為必要、熟字注音、亦有備忘之用、民衆及兒童閱濟時、果係未忘之熟字、自不會再看注意、何至多費工夫、若偶忘共音、即旁　而識、其檢查詢問之時問即節省矣、至謂敎學時淆亂視覺、分散注意、更不必慮、因注音即係識字之符號、猶之句護標點、並非摻雜別種事物也、</p>
<p>不耗目力</p>
<p>（二）耗目力、此係敎科書字體大小問題、字體太小、卽不加注音亦耗目力、且已識未忘之字、閱讀者斷不須字字細看符號、若謂附加符號即易引起近視之危險、則日本人每日看朝日新聞者、都成近視眼矣、因日本普通報紙、雖小如六號漢字、亦皆旁注假名、即以便利民衆及兒童之閱讀也、、</p>
<p>不易差誤</p>
<p>（三）易差誤、此層似更不必過慮、蓋幼年兒童每易誤認符號為文字之一切部分者、乃敎學上應注意之問題、且差誤之原因、即正在無淸楚正確的注音漢字之字模、將來用此一律注音、文字居中、符號在右、行欽分明、賓主相對、較之從前偶一注音、字體惡劣者、自可不再發生差誤之機會、</p>
<p>從事研究</p>
<p>（四）應先從事研究、此項我（黎氏自稱）亦贊成、惟此種試騐、須先有其工具、即須印出多量之注音漢字讀物，非可空言研究者、故必實行然後有結果、所謂「不行則不得謂之知」也、但若此時即斷然實行、縱或「少益」、亦决不至「有害」云、</p>

<h3>錢莊業之衰敗及其前途（續）</h3>
<p>— 吳曉晨</p>
<p>話雖這樣；可是信用的收縮，祇是一句極範統極含糊的話，也只是事之果，而非事之因；我們當然還得追求所以形成收縮的因素，錢莊業衰收的危象，旣這般重大，更不容我們用這種輕描淡寫的語氣來交待過去的。現在且作進一步的推究：</p>
<p>自從物物交換時代進而為金屬貨幣交換時代以後，社會經濟的組織，發生重大變化，借貸的方式，亦由此推開。蓋事業隨時代的演進而日漸擴張，而資金的運用，亦隨事業的擴張而增進其需要。不過這二者之間，必須取得一種適當的聯絡，然後纔可在借貸關係下五相利用；要知道社會上很多坐擁着鉅資而不事業務的資產階級，同時也有日欲企劃事業而迫於資金不克擴張其計劃的事業家，資本家旣未必為事業家，事業家更未必是資本家。錢莊業的產生，就是補救這種缺陷，而成為流通資金的媒介，使資本家和事業家，因錢莊的轉助而取得間接的聯絡。換句話說：就是錢莊旣得社會的信任，即以自己之信用向社會吸收資金，復察客家之信用如何，而與以相當之貸放。至於錢莊業的業務，當然還有匯兌，貼現等項目，不過牠最大的企圖，誰也知道就在放欵和存欵的高低利率差額中找取利潤！</p>
<p>錢莊業藉存放欵高低利率不同而所得的利潤，以維持其融通社會金融的權力，那末我們要明白，這利潤的所出，是接受錢莊貸欵者所提供，錢莊業的放欵，旣以工商業為主。則工商業實是營養錢莊業生機的源泉，也可說錢莊業是寄生在工商業之下的一種分潤組織。設句更露骨的話：也就是坐地分贓之賭塲塲主的變相。所以錢莊業欲求自身的健全，須先渴望工商業的繁榮。而工商業的一切，却又受制於農村，農村的生產和消費旣是相對的，那末生產能力越增，工商業的發展也越大，這中間的關係非常密切。我們現在可以引用李去非作的「書洛陽名園記後一的筆法，說句槪括的話。：「錢莊業的興替，候於工商業之盛衰而知；工商業之盛衰，候於農村之榮枯而得。」</p>
<p>經不起帝國主義經濟侵略的宰割，而復橫受層層刮削下的中國農村，在最近幾年中，漸漸趨向沒落，而將走上破產的危途，巳是大家習知的事實，這裏也無須浪費篇幅。但是農村衰落了以後，休戚與共的工商業，眞好比前無去路後有追兵的一批潰卒，行將瓦解！錢莊業適巧立在陣綫的前面，非特營業的重心，遭受嚴電的打擊，而在一食糜實然後知禮節的古訓昭昭之下，萬刧不復的工商業，今天淸理，明日倒閉，鬧成一團的當兒，往昔斷斷自守唯恐或懈人生第二生命的信譽，到這般地步，雖欲求全而不能。以致工商業對錢莊應繳利息的支付，不消說往往談不到，即對借欵的償還，亦困難萬分。可是錢莊對提供資金的存戶，却不容有絲毫的拖欠，或轉緩的可能，以致處於絕對矛盾形態下的錢莊業，窮途日暮，大有求生不得，求死不能之概。繼農村和工商業破產之後，人心破產的聲浪，遂亦甚器塵上，所以我說錢莊業的衰敗，山於一般信用的收縮；不過一般信用的所以收縮，實為農村和工商業的破產所促成！</p>
<p>錢莊業的衰敗，其主要病源，旣在農村，所以內地的錢莊，因為和農村來得接近，故衰敗的景象，也較通商口岸的錢莊要早，並且受創也比較深刻：例如蠶絲區域內的錢莊，在三年前，巳是不堪收拾。而通商口岸如上海。天津。厦門等處的錢莊，則在最近一二年內，才無法隱蔽自己的弱點，這還因一般信用收縮以後，內地的資金不斷向都市集中，通商口岸的錢莊，或受回光返照的餘輝，——事實上錢莊權力不敵銀行所得甚微——所以多堅持了一二個年頭。</p>
<p>吳興·常州·和徐州的錢莊，最後都只剩一家苟延殘喘，而安慶·嘉興·海鹽等處的錢莊，則竟全數停歇，然而我們要知道，吳興等處幾十家錢莊，並不是家家都無法立足，這中間良莠不齊，决不能等量齊觀。可是一般信用收縮以後，一髮可以牽動全身，社會因某地某錢莊的倒閉，而對某地整個錢莊業的信任心，完全發生疑問，這豈不是危險到極點嗎？所以很多收付極可相抵的錢莊，因無法應付存欵的擠提而停業。這般情形下的錢莊業，大有動彈不得之苦，尤其是內地的錢莊，囚為　羅欵項較通商口岸困難得多。因此在客觀條件下，內地的錢莊也不易獲得他人信任的機會，資金的流動，漸漸失去往日特具的控制能力，而內地資金，遂也如川歸海地向都市集中了。這樣一來，內地的資金愈枯竭，金融的周轉，也愈不靈，一敗塗地的錢莊業，當然受禍很深；可是農村經濟却因枯澀而迅速地破產，成為中國目前腹心之患。</p>
<p>三</p>
<p>此次錢莊業的衰敗，固然不是破題兄第一遭，在過去如中法開戰，以及橡皮股票騙局的風潮，錢莊業也橫遭危害。而辛亥鼎革時，大局杌隉，風木頻驚，錢莊業尤覺亟亟可危，衰敗的景象，雖沒有像今日這般普遍，而恐慌的程度，却也不在今日之下。不過以往的衰敗，只不過是一時或局部的創傷，有如患輕度的感冒，雖形寒形熱的來勢很兇猛，但如有休養的機會，即不難回復固有的康健。所以以往的錢莊，衰敗雖然衰敗，不旋踵間，仍能重興。現在的情形，當然不能和過去的相提並論了，病勢的沉重，巳不是輕度的感冒，而變為念性的肺炎，以故依照目前的特殊環境來論錢莊業的前途，恐怕誰也不敢傾向樂觀吧！</p>
<p>况且一般信用收縮以後，錢莊業信用放欵的立塲，巳根本發生動搖。而法律的救濟，又極空泛。一方崇尙抵押放欵的銀行勢力，又異常膨脹，間接更予錢莊業以嚴重的威脅，如工商界向錢莊借欵後所得的貨物，復可向銀行抵押，無形中使錢莊失去貨物的保障，而僅恃信用。所以民廿一年春，杭州緯成織綢廠因不能償還中國銀行的債務而停業，致使杭垣聲譽卓卓之惟康錢莊，因墊放信用放欵甚巨，該廠停業後，本利無着，不得不隨緯成之後，宣告淸理。</p>
<p>有同驚弓之鳥的錢莊業，在這樣艱危交乘的年頭，當然巳不能故步自封，為社會計，為自身計，應當怎樣改弦易轍，方可不為時代所淘汰。所以上海的錢莊，今年對營業方針，有重大的改變，而改變之主要目的，在乎收縮放欵，故往來摺有至今尙未分送者。實則內地的錢莊，在二三年前，早巳依此原則辦理，在力竭聲嘶的境地下，也不容不採取緊縮政策，希圖苟安。上海錢莊衰敗較晚，故至今纔有改善業務的發動。可是經此轉變以後，無疑的社會金融，更將陷於停頓狀態中，這豈是萬全之策？否則二三年前的內地錢莊，早巳各具戒心，何以至今仍是一籌莫展？而內地自農村以至工商業，何以反益形凋敝呢？申地更有少數錢莊，準備坐貼開支拆息，實行停止放欵，以俟市面轉機，再圖活動之傳說，此亦舍本遂末之談，要知以有限之資本，那能供無厭之虛耗，結果守株待兎，坐食山空，恐市面未必如錢莊所期望而即否極泰來，而錢莊或已先市面復蘇（？）而山窮水盡。</p>
<p>錢莊業旣是寄生在工商業之下，那末錢莊業的衰敗，不僅是自身的問題，因此錢莊業的前途，也就萬難離工商業而自闢生路。今後補救之道，不僅在自身之覺悟，以及內部組織之興革，人力財力之集中。其大者重者，乃在援助工商業之復興；不過欲求工商業之復興，須先療治病重如山的農村。關於農村的挽救，第一須使農村經濟的圓活，蓋農村經濟圓活以後，纔能恢復農村生產能力，因此可以增加一般人民的購買力來鼓勵工商業的繁榮，藉工商業的繁繁榮來發展錢莊業對工商業的放欵。因其如此，故覺目前錢莊業在失敗後所改變的措施，適得其反，噬膚滅鼻，並非策自已之安全，而在滅自己之生路。所以此種緊縮政策，極少有長時間支持的可能，假使一心一意地要堅持下去，那就無異自掘墳墓！</p>
<p>不過話又說回來了，以錢莊業區區的力量，决不能使農村經濟走上圓活的途徑、即現在銀行界所高唱的農村投資，亦屬似是而非，所以有人說：「資金回到農村去，誠然農村現在十二萬分的需要資金，但是未將農村不斷的逆態的流出資金的原因，和未將資金不能回到農村去的條件改變以前，資金是不會巨量的回到農村去的。即使人為的流回一點點，能否有益於破產的農村，和是否會眞正的落到農民身上，那是十分成為疑問的。」（新中華二卷一期一零八頁）可見欲使農村經濟圓活，其先决條件，還在阻止農村農業資本逃到通商口岸去建築洋房，而農村資金所以外流，則泰半因內地錢莊失去控制能力所致，錢莊業所以無法控制，則因一般信用的收縮，信用的所以收縮，則因工商業的一落千丈，工商業的所以一落千丈，則囚農村破產的現象益明顯，這是陳陳相因的。所以挽救農村的責任，雖非力量薄弱的的錢莊所可担任，但以自身關係的密切，在此刻全國上下，一致致力於農村重興的時候，錢莊業應就能力之所及，全力改善環境，然後才有一綫之希望可言。若一味以緊縮坐食為得計，則錢莊業的前途，非我們所願言。（完）</p>
<h3>銀行存息高低的商榷</h3>
<p>— 李俊思</p>
<p>近年銀行利率的增高，巳成為般週知的事實；定期存欵年利在一分左右的，已屬司空見慣；活期儲金週息在四五釐的，亦不足為怪。但銀行利率的增高，對於經濟社會有極不良的影響，所以一般有識之士，莫不引為隱　，並有巳引起政府注意之處，可見本問題的重要了。不過我們要討論銀行利率的高低，首先該明自利率祭什麽？利率的發生基於利息，所以現在先從利息說起。</p>
<p>凡稍有經濟常識的，都能够知道，如果某甲能够自由支配他所有的一千塊銀，那麽，某甲的手中，就有將一千塊錢變成比一千塊多的錢的權力。但某甲祇是個貨幣資本家，他不能適當的支配這一千塊錢，於是他去借給企業家某乙，限期一年。當某乙接受了這一千塊錢時，就作為資本，運用到生產事業上去，到了一年，某乙大概可得到一百多塊錢的利潤，而述本增殖到一千一百多塊錢，於是某乙在一千塊錢上再加上一百多塊錢的一部分若干元，歸還原主，這若干元，我們便叫它利息。</p>
<p>由此看來，所謂利息，是資金使用的報酬金或代價；而上面所說的某乙付給某甲一百多塊錢的一部分若干元，就是使用一千塊錢的酬報。但這不過是某乙所得的一部分，决不為超過某乙所得的全部的。因為某甲如果所得的資金使用酬金，等於某乙運用資金所得的全部利潤時、某乙就白費心思，毫無所得了、所以利息低不過是利潤的一部分、但是我午深信，如果某乙運用這一千塊錢的結果，很幸運的增殖到一千五百塊或一千五百塊以上，那麽，某甲利息的獲得，必也相對的增大起來。可是在事實上，如果將這一千塊錢運用在正當的生產事業上，决不會有這樣大的獲利的。倘必要獲到這樣龐大的利潤，那必須投放到不正當的生產事業上去，或一變投資而為投機行為，但這種投放，獲利雖厚，危險性却極大，時時有喪失本金的可能。所以我們可說：獲利豐厚的事業，其所含的危險性亦必重大。</p>
<p>本來，利息的高低大小，完全和商品市塲的價格一樣：是由資本的需要和供給相調節的。如果資本的需要迫切，利息必隨之而大；反之則小。所異的就是商品的價格，在普通情形下，必須成本加上利潤，方不致蝕本，而資本則並不是這樣。在這個原則下，會使我們聯想起往時農村經濟破產，資金集中都市，在上海造成過程的局面，可是那時滬上各銀行，非惟沒有减低存欵的利息，以適應資金的過剩，並且有計多銀行，正在這時爭相以利息優厚為標榜吸引資金。這種畸形的狀態，雖別有其資金去路的背景在，但我們亦可以看出銀行界對於資金的過剩和缺乏，是絲毫沒有調節的機能，而全是在畸形下發展的。</p>
<p>上面所說的，都是關於利息，至於利率，就是借出的資金在一定期限內所獲得的利息，對於全部資本額的比率。</p>
<p>二</p>
<p>我們旣巳明白利率是利息對資本金的比率，而利息就是使用資金的酬報；現在且讓我們來看看銀行對於資本的使用付了怎樣的報酬，換句話說，就是銀行對於需要資金的企業家懷了多大的慾望。</p>
<p>一般說來，銀行的利率，大致可分為存欵利率和放欵利率兩種。存欵的利率在歐美的銀行，大都是不重視的；在民衆方面，存錢於銀行，也都不斤斤於利率的高低。所以往來的活斯存欵。大多數的銀行，只是代司出納，不給利息的；或許有少數的銀行，也有利息的給予，但我們敢斷定是極微細的。放欵利率雖比較重視，但自從一九二九年世界經濟恐慌發生以來，物價跌落，生產呆滯，銀行家為减輕產業家的負擔計，世界各銀行利率都有顯明的减低的趨勢。世界經濟恐慌的發生，對吾國並不是沒有影響的，在外貨猛烈的傾鉗下，我國的經濟命脈根本發生了動搖；加以國內農村經濟衰落日趨嚴重，以致工商萎靡，市場蕭條，照理在這樣嚴重的環境的逼迫下，銀行的利率當亦有减低的趨勢；可是我們看到的銀行的利率，非惟絲毫沒有减低的趨勢，反隨着恐慌程度的深刻化而有遞增的現象。這種發展，尤以近　二年來為最。當小銀行如雨後春笱般的一家家成立，利率亦漸漸抬高；大銀行的態度雖　持重，然定期存欵的利率，亦多至八九釐。可見銀行在存欵方面利率的提高，已成為一般的趨勢。記得去年十月十一日中國興業銀行因組設國際賽馬會失收而倒閉，後來負責人員陸續被捕，在第一特區法院審訊時，庭長責其以高利騙取存欵，被吿律師提出證據辯護，謂存欵週息在一分以上的，不僅被吿一家。這被吿律師的辯護，我們可毫不疑遲的承認是實情。這非他，委實是銀行存欵利率在一分以上的，巳成為普通的現象。在這裏我們可很容場的指出幾家來，作為佐證。有則存疑利率的規定，定期的三個月六釐，六個月七釐，九個月八　，一年一分，二年一分一釐，三年就達一分一釐；活期的也大得非凡，存滿六個月年息五釐，存滿一年年息七釐，存滿一年半年息八釐，存滿二年就一分差一釐而達九釐了。再有比他為高的，如定期存欵半年七釐半，一年九釐，二年九釐半，三年一分，四年一分零半釐，五年一分一　（據廣吿有一分三釐半）；活期存欵自五釐至七釐，此外還有種「取得活期提用之方便，享受定期優厚之利息」的特種儲金，利率也在一分以上。利率這樣的高昂，眞有點出人意外而使人吃驚。但據報章記載，存戶除享這樣大的利率外，在開戶時這可得到銀行精美的贈品，於此可見銀行對於資金的取得，是怎樣的鞠躬盡瘁了。但我們應該注意的：這裏所舉的，不過是我們所能够見到的一斑而巳，其他還有許多的銀行，在這種資金的爭奪戰下，或許還有更大的利率呢！</p>
<p>在這種情形下，我們要加以剖視的，就是銀行對於存欵的利率，為什麽會這樣的遞高呢？第一：是由於社會心理的養成。依據我國的社會情形。當某人要將他所有的資金儲放到銀行中去時，他不問這家銀行的信用是否良好，資金的運用是否正當，而是先要看銀行的存欵章程，能够給予多少利息；基於這種環境下，銀行欲求資金的取得，不得不提高利息，以迎台社會心理了。第二：是小銀行的衆多。這種銀行的規模都不大的，有一部分是由錢莊改組的，他們的資本額大都是五十萬到一百萬，資本額旣小，勢力當很薄弱，在金融市塲上不能和大銀行競爭，於是退而從事於資金的爭奪。而存欵利率的提高，就成為奪取資金的惟一工具。</p>
<p>銀顯明的，銀行對於存欵給予這樣豐厚的利息，但銀行對存戶雖處在債務人的地位，對需要資本的產業家却站在債權人的地位；換句話說，就是銀行對於豐厚的利息付給，是以轉嫁的方式委託於需欵的產業家的。不但如此，銀行本身不是盡義務的，所以銀行還要從存欵利率和放欵利率的差額中，竄取餘利。職是之故，需欵的產業家不但須担負銀行付給存戶的優厚的利息，同時須担負銀行的企業利潤，—一般的利潤扣去利息的剩餘部分。可是處在這工商不振的局面下，產業家有沒有能力担負這樣重大的負担呢。無疑的，這是問題。</p>
<p>三</p>
<p>銀行利北的提高，甚至達一分以上，我們看到，在往昔工商發達的時候，正當產業能夠獲利到一分以上的巳不多見；在這工商凋敝的現階段，正當產業能够獲利到一分的，當然更如鳳毛麟角。所以銀行這樣高昂的利率，决不是現在的產業界所能擔負的。同時其流弊所及，不但對整個社會有極大的為害，就是銀行本身也將連帶地發生無法避免的危機，這是多麽嚴重的事件！</p>
<p>現在讓我們詳述一下銀行提高利率的弊害：（一）對於正當產業的：（甲）間接的　造成金融資本與產業資本的分離狀態，使正當產業無從發展。—正當生產事業的獲利旣如前說是有限的，當然不能滿足銀行家貪饜的慾望，於是銀行就很難借欵給產業家。可是每種產業的自從製造至於出售的全部過程中，需要鉅額的資金以便週轉，是不可缺乏的條件。現在銀行家旣為了利率上的懸殊，不能放欵給產業家，於是正當的產業，無從發展，即巳發展的，缺乏資金的灌溉，亦有漸趨萎靡的危險。（乙）直接的—加重產業的成本，使商品不能在市塲上競爭。—事實當然不能一槪抹殺的，現在有許多的產業，還接受銀行的貸欵。但接受銀行高利的貸欵的結果，徒增加了產業的成本一試舉紡織工業為例：紗布係大量生產，需用鉅額資金，自製造以至晚售，又須相當時日，其間資金的利息，為計算成本的一要素。利率的高低，足以支配事業的消長，普通廠家一十支的棉紗，每包須負擔金利十三元至十五元，與日商棉紗之有政府或其他機關補助者，相較不啻有霄壤之隔。在此種情形之下，華商紗廠任是如何掙扎，終難與日商競爭，其他所謂民族工業，莫不皆然。」（三卷一期新中華）所以往往有些工廠，一方面急於資金的獲得，一方面又苦於本國銀行利率的高昂，出於無法，只得乞隣外國銀行了。如最近被滙豐拍賣的申新七廠，即為一例。這種情形，眞令產業界有點哭笑不得。（二）對於整個社會的：（甲）投資房地產，平民生活困苦。—銀行對房地產投資，獲利之厚，遠非放欵產業界所能及的。所能銀行都踴躍於房地產的投資。這種傾向的由來，先是農村破產，內地資金集中上海，躱於銀行，銀行旣感到投資困難，復覺資金過剩，於是漸漸作房地產的投資，一時頗能獲利。就在就種情形下，銀行一面再接冉厲的作房地產投資，一面再提高存欵利率，吸引資金，可是上海的房地產，經銀行界投資之後，地價日昂，房租日貴，平民的收入，三分之一要供給房主，這樣平民的生活亦受著間接的影饗而困苦了。（乙）使擁資金的無心企業。—擁有資金的人，見銀行有這樣高利的給予，大都將資金存入銀行，安心享受利息，不再從事於企業的投資；這無論對國家對社會都是個嚴重的損失。（三）對於銀行本身的：就是銀行營業趨向投機，以便一方面應付高厚的利率，一方面本身有更多的獲得。可是投機事業，在前面巳說過，危險性極大，在存戶時時有喪失本金的可能，在銀行吏時時有倒閉的危險。在先前巳有不少的銀行，因營投機事業失敗而倒閉，如中國與業銀行，即為適當的一例。</p>
<p>由上看來，銀行的提高利率，實是有百弊而無一利的。如果說必欲提出銀行提高利率有利於社會，為銀行家辯護的話，那麽，唯一的只好說是提倡儲蓄，養成人民節儉的風氣了。這一點，我們也承認銀行提高利率後，確能吸引大量資金，使人民部將剩餘資金從事於儲蓄。但是銀行吸引這資金後，運用是否正當？是否投　二在造益國家社會的事業上？如果銀行家能够將這正報吿出來，恐怕也有些不能自圓具說吧！</p>
<p>四</p>
<p>綜觀上述，銀行利率實有迅速厘正的必要。我們看到銀行以高利吸收來的資金，其主要的運用途徑，除了房地產的投資外，還有就是公債的買賣。公債的買賣；買進近期，賣出遠期，所謂「套利」，本可得一分以上的利率。但公債市塲自經銀行界大量的買賣，其價格巳漸漸的高漲，市價對票面，平均在七折以上。債券價格四漲，銀行巳不能套做，故行將此路不通。同時房地產方面，亦是這樣：自從上海工商不振，市面蕭條以來，商店紛紛倒閉，空屋日益增高，地價日趨低落，故房地產的投資，亦巳路不通行。銀行失了這兩條生財大道後，再也沒有可以獲利這樣豐厚的事業，所以有許多銀行都巳改變方針，趨向於農村的放欵，但農村放欵的獲利，决不會如營地產公債一樣豐厚的。所以銀行對於自己抬高的利率，必有陷於無法應付的一日，而又不得不暗想辦法，以維持對外的信譽。</p>
<p>我們知這，銀行放欵利率的所以高昂，實基於存欵利率的支出浩大：所以欲求放欵利率的减低，首先應該减低存欵的利率。但欲謀存欵利率的减低，如果銀行能够自動减低，當然是再好沒有的事。否則必須政府與民衆的同時進行方能奏效。依據個人的管見，以為應該：（一）規定存欵利率的最高限度，—這限度規定後，無論那家銀行，其存欵利率最高不得超過此限度。這種限度的規定，須由政府厘訂，因我國有多數規模簡小的銀行，大都不入銀行公會，所以銀行公會的權力實屬有限。但由政府規定後，政府即站在監督的地位，如遇有超過這標準的高利率出現，政府即可施行權力，嚴加取締。此法較公定利率，似覺更勝一籌。因為公定利率，在日本雖著成效，但在我國，公會的組織未會健全以前，恐未能適合；况且銀行利率公定以後，與資金的需要與否完全不能調節，不免失之呆板。所以不如規定其最高限度當然，這最高的限度，不過高也不過低，是完全吻合於我國的經濟情形的。（二）使人民明白銀行以高利吸收存欵的弊害、人民如能充分的明瞭銀行以高利吸引存欵的害處後，知道銀行將其資金做投機的事業，而有全部喪失的危險，必不願再將資金儲放於高利率的銀行，而寧存於信用孚著的銀行。這樣小銀行雖在暗中提高利率，招誘資金，人民也不願嘗試了，所以人民自身的覺悟，亦是不可忽略的一點。</p>
<p>不過，我們應該顧慮的，就是在經濟社會機構不健全的我國，銀行一旦减低存欵利率後，恐引起資金流入外商銀行的危險。我們知道，在往時，同時在現在，外商銀行和本國銀行在利率上有很大的差額。不但在現在决不會有資金移人外商銀行的事情發生，就是將來銀行的存欵利率减至相當限度後，也不至引起資金的流亡。可是到最近，有某外商銀行，因為過去美國自銀政策的實行，海外銀價大漲，於是外商銀行儘量的將存銀運出拋售，以博巨利。就在這種拋售下，發生了存銀空虛的狀態。於是外商銀行就預備吸收現銀，增發鈔票，以充實它的存銀。它吸收現銀的方法，就是提高存欵的利率，使我國銀行的存欵，移入他自己的銀行。所以在銀行减低利率的過程中，這是應該羞重從事的事情。</p>

<h3>報告兩個鄉鎮的醫藥衛生狀況</h3>
<p>— 宋忠鈺</p>
<p>我於上月初旬，應友人之約，赴鎮江縣屬之寶堰鎮診病，順便我就將該鎮的醫藥狀況，詳細調查清楚。我在寶堰時，又被友人約赴句容縣屬的陳府莊鎮診病，我又將陳府莊鎮的醫藥狀況，也調查清楚。今將兩鎮的醫藥狀況，作一詳細報告，自可見出鄉鎮的醫藥缺乏專門人才了。我先說寶堰鎮，該鎮居戶，約兩千餘家，人口約六七千人，中國藥店，大小六家，每一藥店，均有坐堂醫生一人，由藥店供給膳宿。診金不論多寡，均是醫生的，只給藥店賣藥，在自已家裏掛牌的，只有潘姓一人，醫生不問在家在店均出診一元，門診酬報隨意。我又赴北街，參觀一家新醫診所，醫生姓白，係鎮江某醫院。三年以上練習生，此君年歲雖輕，人很和譪，經驗亦較江湖冒牌西醫，豐富多啦。了他詳細一談。據他說，本地仍是相信新醫的外科，皮膚病最多（如濕疹頑癬等）其次就是下腿潰瘍，淋巴腺結核。胯關節結核等，這些外科，全是難醫的病，白君的診例。是掛號診金。一概不收，只取藥資，外科敷一次藥，還要給他些藥帶回去。至多取他五六角，四五十裏，只有寶堰鎮，有新醫診所一處，故白君在寶堰，能維持一年有餘，亦因鄉鎮生活低廉的緣故，最可紀錄的，是中醫和新醫，不但不反對，並且很想和新醫聯絡，因我同友人，至兩家中藥店去閑談。該店醫生和老　，均極端歡迎，並蒙他們請茶請酒，談起話來。是很佩服的。這比較上海，中新醫反對的情形，大不相同了。又調查一家，洋廣貨店，代售西藥，所賣的全是製成的藥，如阿斯比林片，金雞納霜片等，我在他店裏，應買凡位蒙藥片三片，每片竟售至八百文，因為旁的店買不到，所以價值如此之巨，不然就要到鎮江去買，九十裏路，來往路費，細算起來，要比八百文還多。我又調查中藥店，有兩家較大的，尚備有貴重藥品，如羚羊，犀角，人參，麝香等。不過價值巨的可觀了。我在友人家，看一處方，羚羊三分，犀角四分，加上旁的藥十餘味竟開價至十一元三角，又有針炙科醫生二人，一是銀店的老板，是教私學的先和一，每年署天為人醫治發痧，酬報隨病家，多寡不爭，我又被友人，約赴陳府莊鎮診病，該鎮居戶約一千餘家，人口約三千有餘，藥店大小四家，貴重的藥品，是很少的，大半多是醫生，自已開醫藥店，連診病帶賣藥。有一家姓袁的小藥店，備有少許西藥，如黃碘酒等，該店的少東家，他自已說家過新醫，這話我是不相信的，又有針炙科醫生一人，眼科醫生一人，全是土著，由此兩鎮看起來，可見新醫的人才缺乏了。據寶堰鎮土著人談，在豐收的年歲，每一藥店，每年的進欵，大的約人七八百元，小的亦可入三百餘元，今年因農村破產，大小藥店，均不夠開支，兩鎮的居民，十家差不多，有七八家，沒飯吃的，那還有錢去看病呢，有病自然忍著，等好或是等死，真是十二分的可憐，我在這兩個地方，不足半個月，完全義務，診治的病人，約有六十餘人，有的借欵或當衣服去買藥，有的連藥都賣不起，這樣下去，鄉民能得到健康的體質嗎？再要說起兩鎮的衛生　。實在無一可取的地方，街裏的廁所，有八處，有的在門外擺一糞缸，每一個小弄裏，有五六個尿桶，蒼蠅到處亂飛，菜館的菜，是蒼蠅先吃，人後吃，飲水更不要說了。因為今年旱，河水少，挑來的水，就是泥水，非用明凡末澄清，決不能飲，你要和他們講衛生，真是對牛談琴了。我今有個提議，組織幾班旅行施診團，由正式醫師，率領看護，攜帶大比藥品，分赴各鄉鎮施診，並設衛生宣講所，每鎮半月或一月，鄉民可以得到不少的利益，可是這筆欵，那裏去籌呢？我想政府如能辦到更好，不然應由滬上名人，首先提倡，請各慈善家，捐欵舉辦，這確是救濟農民的第一，要務惟能否成為事實，我就不敢妄下斷語了。</p>
<h3>現在松江醫藥衛生概況（續）</h3>
<p>— 傅積仁</p>
<p>（九）新興之戒煙所</p>
<p>縣立戒煙所於去年十月間開始籌備，二十號報成立，而於十一月一號開幕者，由省禁煙委員會會委馮友鹿為所長，所址在舊婁縣隍廟。內分診察，調劑，調驗，化驗室及病房。病房又分自願及勒戒二種，均為男女分開者。職員為所長兼產任醫師，助理醫師二人，化驗師一人，護士二人，事務員四人。自開辦迄今，調驗者共三十九人，自願戒除者二十三人，勒令戒除者七十九人，成績甚佳，其所採戒煙方法，以發泡為主，兼用血清法，注射藥品法，與麻醉品遞減法。全視戒煙者之身體現狀與經濟為定，尤多一星期左右可以戒絕，戒絕後並出一證明書。其納費分甲二十元，乙十元，丙二元三種，膳食另加。</p>
<p>（十）慈善機關</p>
<p>（甲）中國紅十字會松江分會：此會於民國十三年江浙戰爭時方成立，無一定之會址，常借各醫院為臨時會址。初因戰事，辦一臨時傷兵醫院，及難民收容所數處。十六年時革命軍至，醫院乃停，其中主持者亦多去職。後於每年夏季。舉辦時疫醫院數次。最近則因浙省難民過境甚多，特設立臨時浙江旱災過境難民收容所，地址在超果寺。已於上月三十一號開始收容，一方分發糧食等，一方由會中推定柯德瓊·張紹修·二人為西醫主任，及中醫二人辦理施診治給藥事宜。</p>
<p>（乙）施醫局：乃松江商會於每年夏季時方開辦者，內分西醫中醫二部。收掛號費銅元六枚，更注射防疫針，為期僅三月。</p>
<p>（丙）縣立醫院：每年夏季，特設一時疫部，免費注射防疫針，如診病，則以施診例收費，院內更另設病房數間，又派醫師護士分往各公共機關內注射防疫針。</p>
<p>本縣雖有上述之慈善機關，然前者僅一社會事業性質，又無醫院之設施；後者則僅為暑期中短短之三月期限耳，且又非完全施診給藥者，故甚望政府當局有以注意之。</p>
<p>（十一）新醫團體</p>
<p>松地雖有醫師十數人之多，然至今未有醫師公會，或其他新醫團體之組織，且亦無新醫刊物之發行，即報章亦未之登載，更無人有此擬議也，余將為新醫界同人惋惜！</p>
<p>（十二）結論</p>
<p>余來松僅三月有半，經斷續之一月，餘探詢與調查，始得完成本文。自經調查之後，使余發生無限感想。先就衛生行政言，松江距上海甚近，火車或汽車僅需一小時餘即達，理應一切建設甚為發展，然街道之狹小如故，市內最繁盛之貫通東西一大道，僅能通人力車一輛有奇，然雖有衛生行政之設施，而實際等於烏有。據雲乃因經費關係也。各街道之垃圾滿堆路中，各小巷之弄口，幾均為公共之便溺處，非在夏日，行經其地，已覺其臭不可耐，如至夏令，則又不知如何矣。全城無自來水固無論矣，即有自流井者，亦甚少見。大多取諸河水，而淘米洗菜亦為同一之河水！居戶水飲料，更非河水不可！余初到數日，誠有不願飲之概，然無他法可求，至今已不覺其苦矣！余想傳染病流行之際，其危險將不堪設想也！</p>
<p>次及新醫界而言，松馳之開業醫師，亦有十餘位之多，其資格亦以正式學校畢業者為多，而新醫之流入亦為時甚久，但至今未有新醫團體之組織成立，以資互相聯絡感情與研究學術，別之分歧，然究其實際，因私人之利害關係，常有私爭暗鬥之事發生，亦為吾新醫界之恥也。</p>
<p>再有一事，值得討論者，乃醫院中招收學生，兼充護士之職，似有舊醫方法之嫌，余不知他地亦有此情形否？</p>
<p>本地這新藥業，可謂不景氣。並無藥劑師之聘請，可供病家配方，且專售若幹成藥，生意亦甚有限，有時需用藥品，非至上海不可，實使人失望！</p>
<p>更就堂堂一縣立醫院言，設備之簡陋，組織之散漫，殊使人不之信。然究其原因，不外經費困難，收入有限所致。而其特殊之情形，更非私人任院長不呆：再為他處所少見者。尚望縣政府諸公，有以改正之！</p>
<p>最後，特在此向柯德瓊醫師及第一區巡官陸建分先生致謝！承二位之指教助我不少材料，得以完成本文！</p>
<h3>耳鼻喉眼衛生常識</h3>
<p>— 唐仁縉</p>
<p>（四十一）耳鼓膜</p>
<p>耳鼓膜在聽器當中，要算一個重要的部分。他的功用。仿佛留聲機上的一個唱頭。他的形狀也相仿。如果留聲機沒有唱頭。或者唱頭有了損壞。那就不能發言音。所以在聽器當中。如果缺少了耳鼓膜。或者耳鼓膜患者疾病的時候。那就聽覺當然同時也要發生困難（當然還有其他一切的危險病象。）因為耳鼓膜是聽器的音波傳達主要的部分。是決不可有什麼病理上的變化的。所以耳科醫生在診察耳病的時候。一定先要詳察耳鼓膜。是否保持著生理的狀態及有無病理上的變化。論到耳鼓膜的生理狀態。本來是很複雜的。現在不妨大略講一講。同時也可作為答覆平時諸位問我「耳鼓膜是什樣的」的一個機會。</p>
<p>（一）耳鼓膜的位置　鼓膜是外聽道與鼓室（屬於中耳）的一個隔膜。所以他的位置。就是在外聽道與鼓室的交界處。</p>
<p>（二）耳鼓膜的形狀　鼓膜是一個灰白……。依年齡</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>的不同而有稍異，就是初生兒同乳兒的鼓膜。是正圓形。發育成人的鼓膜。是橢圓形、更因他的形態、分為緊張部（圖一）及弛緩部（圖二）的兩部、緊張部占居鼓膜的大部分。弛緩部占居鼓膜的小部分。這兩部是依着兩個　讓來分界限的。走向前端的。稱爲鼓膜皺襞（圖三）。走向後端的。稱爲後鼓膜皺襞（圓四）</p>
<p>（三）耳鼓膜表面的形態在第（二）條中所講的兩個皺襞的會合處。有一個凸出的小部。稱爲槌骨短突起部（圓五）。由此向下。則可察見槌骨柄（圓六）。鼓膜的中央。有一個臍形部。稱爲鼓膜臍（圖七）。在鼓膜臍的前下方。有一個三角形的光錐體（圖八）。我們用耳鏡診察鼓膜的時候。常可得見三角形的反射光</p>
<p>（四）耳鼓膜的組織構造鼓膜的組織。是由皮膚層，固有層及粘膜層的三部而構成。但是在弛緩部的鼓膜。是沒有固有層的。</p>
<p>（五）耳鼓膜對於聽覺上的重要外來的音波。傳至我們的聽器而發生聽覺的道路。本有兩途。一爲氣導。一爲骨導。骨導是由頭蓋骨的振動而傳導的。氣導是音波傳達的主要道路。就是外來的音波。先經外聽道傳至鼓膜。再由鼓膜導至和他連接的三個聽小骨（就是槌骨，砧骨及爲鐙骨的三個聽小骨。是包容在鼓室及上鼓室裏面的，這三個聽小骨並且以關節而互相繫連的。）更由聽小骨的振動。而達內耳。此時方始發生聽覺。</p>
<p>（六）耳鼓膜在什麼時候才會有病變關於這個問題。範圍很廣。簡單的說起來。就是在鼓膜的外傷，歐氏管的狹窄，歐氏管的閉塞。中耳的炎症，及各種急性傳染病（譬如像流行性感冒，氣管炎，肺炎，實扶的里，猩紅熱，麻疹，腸梯扶期等等）等等。都可以使鼓膜發生病變的。至於一切詳細的說明。日後當可叙述。</p>
<p>（一）緊張部</p>
<p>（二）弛緩部</p>
<p>（三）前鼓膜皺襞</p>
<p>（四）後鼓膜皺襞</p>
<p>（五）槌骨短突起部</p>
<p>（六）槌骨柄</p>
<p>（七）鼓膜臍</p>
<p>（八）三角形光錐體</p>

<h3>止痛的醫學</h3>
<p>— 李興</p>
<p>（八）</p>
<p>腸梗阻（Infestinal　Obstruction）腸子梗阻是一種很疼痛的毛病並且也是一種很危險的毛病。腸梗阻有以下幾種：（一）是腸絞窄約佔總梗阻中百分之三十五。（二）腸紐，糾纏，成結約佔總數百分之十二。（三）腸套疊佔總數百分之三十八。（四）腸內被外物阻塞佔總數百分之十一。（五）腸收縮狹窄或被內外瘤阻塞佔總數百分之四。第一種（腸絞窄Strangulation）爲壯年人所常有的。第二種常起於受傷或服猛性瀉藥。第三種是腸之一段疊起套在別的一段，患者多爲幼童嬰兒。第四種外來之物如膽石，口嚥下外來之物，腸內寄生蟲等塞滿腸內。第五種腸收縮窄狹常是痢疾，腸癆，腸內梅毒等的結果。其次腹內生瘤亦阻碎腸內的通行。</p>
<p>急性腸梗阻起頭就是腹部猛痛。痛初起於梗阻處漸及於全腹部。痛也常反射在腹之中心。小腸梗阻比大腸梗阻痛厲害些。如果腹膜炎隨腸梗阻而起腹痛亦更甚，就是手指一觸肚皮疼痛也就難忍。</p>
<p>現在略談談止痛的方法。大多數急性腸校阻須用外科手術。慢性梗阻用藥物治療亦可。如單用麻醉品止痛是不對的，因麻醉品所去掉的不過是知覺並不是去掉毛病。急性腸梗阻是很危險的毛病。假設以麻醉品敷衍遷延時間終至挽救乏術。這樣就不能不算是妄用麻醉品之罪。普通人家以瀉藥治腹部百病，但用於腸梗阻痛却是火上加油。其理由卽已梗阻的腸再使起猛烈蠕動（瀉藥的作用）豈不是使梗阻加甚麼。故腹痛時萬不可妄服瀉藥以自招大禍。</p>
<p>腎石絞痛　腎內有時生石，也有時腎石子掉下入輸尿管。石子經過輸尿管時就發生一種非常猛烈的痛，此卽腎石絞痛。這種痛常如靑天霹靂忽然臨身。痛覺到在腎處並且也反射痛到腹部與腹之下部膀胱處，及大腿內部，生殖器等處。這種痛也算是任何疼痛中最疼痛的，就是好漢也必翻身狂呌。一直等到石子落到膀胱內痛才算結束。痛的時候在小便內可查出血與血球來。</p>
<p>治療這種痛是救急的性質，因爲痛可於數小時或數日之內完結，故當疼痛難忍時注射嗎啡也是屬於人道的。這樣當然是痛一停止了麻醉品也要停止。</p>
<p>絞窄的疝氣　現在略談談疝氣是什麽東西。中國老名辭呌做「疝氣」。這個疝字大概是因腹部或男子的陰囊凸起腫大狀爲高起故以山字放在病旁內。至於這個「氣」到現在却未免無稽。這凸起的一塊內中並不是氣。要曉得這裏面到底是什麽東西我們祗要曉得腹皮與腹內的構造就可以明白。腹腔之內是腸胄等。腹腔的皮從內向外是腹膜（薄如紙），肌肉，腱膜，與皮。有時腹皮的肌肉與腱膜有裂痕或軟弱的部分腸卽由這些部分凸出漸久漸大。有時也通入陰囊內卽成陰囊疝氣。疝氣平時很少痛苦，但有時疝氣內的腸絞紐絞窄疼痛便起，痛如刀刺。因腸絞紐其內血脈就不能流通；因無血流通不到幾個小時這絞紐的腸就要壞死（卽局部死去）。此時如再不施行外科挽救漸則病者將無生活希望。（未完）</p>
<h3>印花與醫界</h3>
<p>— 宋國賓</p>
<p>余作本文之動機，發自遠近二事一爲五年前蘇州印花局曾令該地醫界在處方箋上貼用印花，雖經該地醫界一再反對，而至今仍爲懸案。一爲最近醫藥評論社因在廣告收據上忘貼印花二分，至被罰洋二十元是也。</p>
<p>查政府印花稅則之施行，係專爲以營業爲目的之工商業而設，換言之，卽等於工商業之一種營業稅也。醫業雖爲百業之一，而旨在救人，負有保障國民生命之義務，故各國對於醫師，多優異其待遇，從未有以營業性質視之者也。至中國之醫學，則更在萌芽時期，政府若存獎進事業之義，正宜特加優異，今乃肆意誅求，欲令醫師於處方箋上貼用印花。夫處方箋旣非收據，又非契約，與藥房賣藥之發票有異。藥房發票之貼印花。以其含有營業之謀利性質也。今乃以救人性命之藥方，視同謀利性質之發票，是無異於以運用科學頭腦之醫家，認爲純粹營業性質之市儈矣，其爲謬誤，不言可知，此其一。</p>
<p>醫藥評論社爲中比庚欵委員會事業之一，其所出之醫藥評論則專在闡揚學術宣傳醫藥衛生。該社純粹學術文化機關，無絲毫之營業性質。廣告收入，亦僅以補償印刷之費用，乃法院不諒，重加處罰，似屬非宜，此其二。</p>
<p>嘗考印花與郵票，在政府之收入上，居同等重要之地位。故漏貼印花與漏貼郵票，皆須受罰，但郵票欠資，罰僅加倍，如欠資一分者罰二分，欠二分者罰四分而已！至於漏貼印花，處罰乃在千倍以上，印花稅暫行條例第五條曰：</p>
<p>「凡應貼印花各件不貼印花者，或貼用時未蓋章畫押者，每件處以百元以下十元以上之罰金，貼不足數者，每件處以五十元以下五元以上之罰金，均酌量情形辦理」，</p>
<p>觀此可知漏貼印花罰欵之駭人矣！印花郵票，同爲國營事業，而處罰之輕重乃懸異若此。此誠令人不解者也，此其三。</p>
<p>綜觀上述，則印花稅暫行條例，實有修改之必要，鄙人不敏，謹議數端，以爲將來修改時之參考焉：</p>
<p>暫行條例第三條曰：</p>
<p>「國家所用之契約簿據及其他憑證不貼印花。」</p>
<p>按此條之用意甚顯，蓋以國家所用之契約等，非營業性質也。故下文接以「有營業性質之各種官業仍須貼用」一語，於此可知印花之貼用祇限於有營業性質之官私工商業明矣！夫文化機關，固非營業，而醫師治病，更與工商業有殊。鄙意本條下當添入「文化機關及醫師所用之契約簿據及其他憑證不貼印花」一條，方與政府施行印花稅之宗旨相合。</p>
<p>考人民漏貼印花之原因，不全由於故意逃稅，其中偶爾疎忽，忘於貼用者亦有之，若均科以重金，自必中多寃枉，故罰欵一項，似以漏貼郵票爲例，加倍處罰足矣。</p>

<h3>太活之弊</h3>
<p>— 稜磨</p>
<p>容認寫別字這一種態度，現在有很多人反對了。但反對者似乎都對於最基本的一點，並未觸到。一個字該有個一定寫法，說來是極簡單而又無可反對的。可是現在我們還只知道該，而並不能斷說其已有。某一個字的寫法由古變動到現在，現在的較從前的一定較好是無問題的，但現在的寫法也一定並不是極好。如已極妥當，就一定大家同樣寫而决無歧異，到現在還有人把某字寫別，就是某字本身還有問題，就是要這個字的定寫產生，還須時日。容認寫別字，大概就不外鼓勵這種自然的發展。在這自然發展中，總有一天那字的寫法不期而統一。所以容認別字者與反對別字者間的差異，只是怎樣才有一個定寫的差異。反對者是要立刻在現行寫法中選定一個，容認者是讓時間去產生一個。</p>
<p>理論地說，當前决定是比讓時間决定，更爲爽利，可是誰能提出具體的辦法呢？就能提出其成效也是生問題。專制時代曾屢經有這樣的企圖，我們現在仍能看到字辨那樣的書，大概就是其遺惠或是遺毒。那些正寫，現在大概只能放在考慮之外了，現在有許多活字，早就與科場中的正字背馳，而用活字是現在無人反對的。這些活字，以別字的地位，打出生路，都還不久，其地位也並不十分穩固，一些可以與他們通用的字都還並存着。其活的層度之差，是無法用尺度去量的。如此，我們若現在想决定一個字的正寫，則通用字比別字倒是更大的障碾。</p>
<p>再向一極端方面想，能决定一字的定寫，還不能减少文字上的多少煩難，在許多同義字或詞中，更須要能决定以某一個字或詞爲標準。中國讀書人往往須有一龐大的字彙，而其中的多數是應應付某一意義的另一說法，這或者可擬稱爲「別詞」及「別語」。如果主張字有定寫的人，其目的在使求學者少記許多字，則這方面的問題是須列在考慮之內的。這裏，倒是容認寫別字者對這問題容易解决，因爲若容許以別字替代，則少量的字——可以少到表示一個音的字只有一個——就可以表示一切的詞語了。不過主張容認寫別字者，大致不主張到這樣的極端；而反對寫別字者，也就不想到其節省字彙的主張很難貫澈。</p>
<p>總之，中國文字，如容認寫別字，其弊固然是太活，就不容認寫別字，而可以表一意義之字之詞的多，其弊也還是太活。也許這就是所謂辭料富豐的優點，但這優是應該在大辭典裏擺樣，而不是一般所需要的，現在大概連很小的辭典裏，總也有一半是這樣的陳冽品。現在的別字活字之爭，如果能引致一本給一般人用的標準辭典，倒是很好。自然，倘能以試編標準的白用辭典，來解决這個問題，似更爲簡單些。</p>
<h3>人與書</h3>
<p>— 寒峰</p>
<p>山林隱逸</p>
<p>「新民業報」載憂患餘生「捫蝨談虎錄」中有「桃花扇一題，引該書「餘韻」徐靑君「奉本官籤票，訪拿山林隱逸」一節，說當局「網羅遺佚之苦心。」引文中，有幾句對話，頗有意趣。先是徐靑君問老贊禮，蘇崑山，柳敬亭，說道：「三位是山林隱逸麽」？他們三人答：「不敢，不敢。爲何問及山林隱逸？」徐靑君道：「三位不知麽？現今禮部上本，，搜尋山林隱逸。撫案大老爺，張掛告示，布政司行文，已經月餘，並不見一人報名。府憲著忙，差俺們各處訪拿。三位一定是了，快快跟我回話去。」老贊禮答：「老哥差矣。山林隱逸，及文人名士，不肯出山的。老夫原是假斯文的一個老贊禮，那裏去得？」其餘兩人也答：「我倆個是說書唱曲的朋友，而今做了漁翁樵子，益發不中了。」於是徐靑君很幽默的作結道。「你們不曉得，那些文人名士，都是識時務的俊傑，從三年前俱已出山去了，目下正要訪拿你輩哩。」這個諷刺，令假山人假名士讀了，眞有哭笑不得之感。在維新運動期「新民叢報」一班人，對山林隱逸固無好感，一些小說家們，對此也常有諷刺。吳研人作「上海游　錄」，也就涉及到這班人，在第七回書裏，他說：「我們中國向來有一種名士，或會作些詩詞歌賦，或能作兩篇古文，或懂點金石，最高等的是註疏過一部半部古書，這些人都是自以爲名士的。走起路來，眼睛看著天，自以爲學問充足，恃以驕人。大抵中國中古而後，這種不瘋不顚的名士，向來未曾斷過種，便有許多不長進的人，跟着他們學。」這裏雖說是的名士，實際上是不妨和山林隱逸並論的。可見自稱山人名士的人，實際上並不是心在山林，這也就可見徐靑君眞的到「山林」裏找「隱逸」，眞是天下第一等的大傻瓜了。</p>
<p>「孽海花戲本」</p>
<p>說到東亞病夫的「孽海花」，誰都知道這是維新運動以後的一部重要小說。這部書最初是發表在當時的雜誌「小說林」上的，乙已年第一卷在日本印成單本。續集以下，好像是移到另一刊物「新小說」上發表。有正書局印「孽海花」單本，實際上，已不是第一次了。在「孽海花」發表以後，有署名「天竇宮人」的，曾經把第一卷十回編成戲本，在雜誌「月月小說」上發表，後將作羣學社刊行的「說部叢書」第四十六種，與作者另一戲本「義俠記」（一名「黑奴報恩一，日本尾崎德太郎原本）合冊。這是很少有人提起的。戲本亦分作十幕，情節與原書毫無出入，但並沒有特殊優秀的地方。不過，也有些值得一說的，如第五幕寫臧崙失首馬關的一段唱詞：</p>
<p>（臧占城上唱）旌旗招展龍蛇影，要退敵人十萬兵。占立城樓看得準，兵如潮水往上騰。一霎時黑烟如雲起，雷聲大砲墮邊城。（法兵放砲烘城介）（殺下）（臧赤身足走介唱）一時兵敗如山倒，殺的俺盔甲一齊拋。一着棋走錯全盤左，書生用武誤六韜。背地裏只把傳相怨，他不該授我計一條。練兵訓將全無靠，外交和欵計為高。今日裏失却馬關道，有何面目對當朝。赤身露體往前跑，去見傳相說根苗。（內塲喊介）砲聲不絕耳邊呌，法人得勝志氣驕，無奈何夾入在難民道（雜扮逃難介），頭頂銅盆找路逃。（戴銅盆逃下介）</p>
<p>把臧耑諷刺得實在辛辣，使人聽到這些唱詞，真是氣也不好，笑也不好。第七幕裏，許鴻荃上塲，有一段帝國主義侵略的唱詞，註作「緊板」：</p>
<p>法蘭西，占越南，閩疆告警。德意志，寇威海，山東不甯。英吉利，騖商務，開埠八省。俄羅斯，侵北邊，要約同盟。五大國，起雄心，思想兼幷。日本國，本同種，也起枭心。羽檄馳，電報飛，政體不定。每日裏，講交涉，焦敝舌唇。</p>
<p>說明當時中國所處的地位，與被侵略的情形，這幾句唱詞，說得是最明白的。至於其他各幕，平平而已。我所見到的戲本，祇這一卷，二卷以後是否有作，則不得而知了。</p>
<h3>家</h3>
<h3>隱</h3>
<p>— 柳湜</p>
<p>一向就不大愛到大舞臺之類的地方去的，所以對於那裏面的風景同人物，知道的就很少。在幼小時，故鄉有漢班，也有京戲，間或同大人一同去玩這些地方，我總看不到掃台戲就溜着跑了。我不要看戲子臉上晝着的那鬼臉，也討厭他們在臺上走八字路，我覺得太不近情理；但大人們一定要對我說，這有道理，畫鬼臉到做臉譜，走人步改是臺步，都是京戲漢戲裏的門檻。眞正的品劇家，是最注意它的。聽說曾經有一個京班子到了C城，剛上舞台就被觀衆一陳「通」打走了，爲的不過是一個大花臉額上少畫了一條黑綫，花旦出臺沒有把眼睛掃塲子］正生的八字路多走了兩步。據說從此以後，京班子知道C城人有眼力，在入境前就得默起火神的。</p>
<p>不過，我在十五歲時，就把這扮鬼臉的秘密拆穿了，發覺了眞正的門檻。那就是有一晚上我同四哥走到了後臺看見那扮大花臉的大漢的面相，活像一隻猪玀，滿面黑麻子上長着許多肉瘤，還叢生着髒而又討厭的鬍子，我頓時心中一定，啊！原來這就是臉譜的作用了。他要隱藏那醜惡的鬼臉，怎能不用一個面具呢。同時我還看見花旦小生，在臺前出現時之好像有點可愛可敬的，但是一到後臺，卸了裝，就同捧她或他的「紳商」動手動脚的胡諷起來，這還有什麽可愛可敬呢</p>
<p>以後，我大抵就不到這些地方了，同時，有點失敬得很，我看不大起中國的舊戲，雖然現在仍有人與江亢虎唱對臺的在那裏發揚國粹，喊出什麼「正戲」的鬼話。</p>
<p>至於在「人行道上，四五十人密集在一起」的「所謂民衆娛樂」無論是賣解，把戲，或唱一段京腔，兩三句小調，甚或同時來一個「毛毛雨」久雖然演出的是「沒有一定的範圍，」像做戲又不能保大舞臺能「演出整本」的，並且沒有排塲，沒有臺，不能走臺步，沒有那紅紅紫紫的顏料畫臉譜，嘴裏發出的又祇是一些沙的聲音，但我却從未討厭它過。在故鄉，我心愛的娛樂塲所是火官殿，水風井，教育會坪等地帶。我常常夾在許多污穢的羣衆間去欣賞這「民衆娛樂」。</p>
<p>到了北平，梅蘭芳博士的男扮女相只看過一次，我常到的地方是天橋，天橋，第三個地方還是天橋。到了上海「西藏路泥城橋附近」，愛多亞路，以及城隍廟等處也是我最歡喜玩的。是的，這有點一低級趣味」，「下流」，但我也覺得這些低級的「藝人」，雖然或是道地的「飯桶」，有些唱得四不像，女的不會弄媚眼，男的臉上露出了一個大疤，我反而以爲比舞臺上那樣藏藏隱隱，「欲蓋彌彰」的醜態要直爽得多，因爲我在街途「藝人」面上看出的只有飢容，並無淫態，只在用簡單的技術行乞，却沒有後臺上隱藏着醜惡，而在前臺行騙，他們雖或是無能，但不至比後臺上的膜大腿還「硬滑稽」。</p>
<p>自然，行乞的賣藝，不會是一種高尚藝術，這猶如行乞不是一種正當的職業一樣。迷於這種「街頭藝術」的人，自然他的生活內容也比這些「藝人」差不厘了。至於像我們還有一套奮西裝可穿的人，雖然不把這些「低級」的「民衆」娛樂，看成得如何下賤，但對他的趣味是有一定限度的。</p>
<p>所以，我們要首先要求改善大衆的生活，同時提高他們的娛樂，都不足嘲笑，尤其在「民衆」尚在過一種這樣的生活，沉於這樣的趣味的形式中時，我們要廢棄舊型，却不可不研究奮型，我們反對低級趣味，却不能把雙眼閉着夢想天堂，何况新的趣味要達到大衆時，利用舊型也是一種法門呢？</p>
<p>至於用嘲笑謾駡的態度去詛咒正在生長中的科學小品，把它比作街上的滑稽戲，而自己以爲是批評、那就只顯得它的淺薄了。我覺得臉譜在中國的勢力眞大，有點害怕太陽，不敢面迎眞理的人，都需要一具，去隱藏自己。</p>

<h3>巨卿先生（三）</h3>
<p>— 柯靈</p>
<p>進了中年以後的巨卿先生，家庭的軍累和境遇的牽掣折磨着他，一片雄心，早被生活的逆風吹盡；在百無聊賴中間，他開始執起了那一枝末路凄淸的銀硃筆。</p>
<p>一方面，他把遼還的將來的好日子，全部寄託在一個「獨養子」的身上。因爲他這時已經一個誠實能幹的兒子，在杭州一家綢廠裏做職員，情形過得很好。但巨卿先生彷彿這一輩子註定的就是交墓庫運，在十年前，正當他們夫妻倆興興頭頭，張羅着爲兒子討了親的一年，那一家綢廠恰巧關了門，兒子失了業，在家裏賦閑起來了。他是好勝的，兼有着父親的遺傳的固執，在社會上幾次碰壁以後，更患上了深沉的慢性憂鬱症。邑鬱地閑了一年多，便傳染着時疫悄悄死去了。拋下了一對年老的父母，一個躭了四個月身孕的年靑的妻。</p>
<p>希望的紅燭被燒成了流不盡的淚，剩下來的祇是寸寸的灰燼了。這以後，一家人便　著巨卿先生那一技銀硃筆，再由婆媳兩個做點針綫，在那沒有花也沒有草的荒凉的人生路上，意着那漫長的旅程。</p>
<p>像蝸牛爬牆似的，這樣難挨的光陰居然也爬過了十年。這中間，生活自然是慘澹透了，巨卿先生唯一的慰藉，便是他兒子留下來的遺腹的孫子，今年已經養到了八歲，一部千字文和神童詩，也可以爛熟地背誦了。</p>
<p>可是，人在一年一年老下去，這世界也像一年一年地在坍下去。</p>
<p>在最近兩年裏面，這鎭上忽然發生一種奇異的現象，六十多歲的巨卿先生開始遇着了新鮮讀書的學生一天比一天少，而教書的私塾却漸漸多起來。祇要稍稍通得一點文墨的人，大家便把它當作一種不化資本的生意做着：許多本來在家鄉坐守田園，這一陣感得江河日下，坐吃山空的所謂「書香子弟」，都教書了；少數從外埠失了業回來的年靑店夥，不是託人介紹進小學校當了教員，便是在家裏騰出一間空屋，開設了蒙館。</p>
<p>這情形使得巨卿先生很氣憤，好像誰駡了他祖宗三代似的難過，跟人一談，到這便紅了臉，搖頭慨嘆着「現在的教書先生是不值錢了」那一類話。因爲，這情形不但玷辱了教育事業的淸高，而且也影響到巨卿先生的蒙館的繁盛了。</p>
<p>巨卿先生的弟子在年不如年地减少。</p>
<p>最難於應付的，還有區立小學校對私塾的明爭暗鬥。因爲學校裏當然也要設法增加學額，像店舖子擴充營業拉一攏主顧一樣。所以去年學校裏主動調查私塾，取締私塾的事情，就不知鬧了幾回。</p>
<p>雖然這兩年很有許多政府要人和社會名流在提倡讀經，但學校取締私塾的口號，照例總是教育陳腐，貽誤學童那一套老文章。</p>

<p>電信特刊</p>
<p>電界之聲</p>
<h3>簡明</h3>
<p>— 楨</p>
<p>發報人士與政軍機關注意</p>
<p>吾人欲寄電報，其電文之簡明與否，與電報之功效大有關係。而華文明語電報之電文，尤以意義明顯為主要條件。茍電文簡到僅用一字，在發報人意在省費，固有權衡，然若此字不能表時何種意義時，則電局必將此電作密語加倍計費。例如電文僅列一「到」「安」「收」「漲」「縮」「跌」「緩」「來」「行」等字。雖僅一字，意義顯然，自可作明語價目收費。至其他單獨之字，不合習慣用法，或非經說明不能明瞭其用意者。例如「游」「率」「劍」「火」等字，應由發報人酌添一二字，以明其意義。否則須按密語計費。故簡之定義，必以明為限，簡而不明，不能達到省費之目的也。</p>
<p>政軍機關發電，多犯電文冗長之病。如報告軍情宣達政令之電報，多至千百言，究其內容，多屬舖張之字。不獨迻譯傳遞，多費人力與時間，且滿紙篇、拍發抄寫、極易錯誤。旣不能正確，又不能迅速，其事已成明日黃花，文則多魯魚亥豕，又何貴乎發此一電耶？故政軍機關之執筆者，應知電報之功效、在於迅且確，而能達到二者之目的，在於電文之簡明。舉凡公文程式之辭句，宣傳性質之文章，均不宜選入電文之內。必也言簡意賅，質樸精練，然後於傳遞時頃刻可到、於讀閱時一自了然，在電局可省材料，在機關可省電費，轉移之間，在乎執筆者之一念。故明之定義，必以簡爲限界，明而不簡，亦無效率之可言也。</p>
<p>蔣總司令知電文簡明之必要，曾於二十二年一月刪電豫鄂皖三省軍政機關，以「查近來各軍政機關發電繁多，或故爲緊急，或過事冗長，以政電路壅塞，電件積壓，要電轉滯，實誤事機。以後無論任何機關發電，電文務求簡明，非萬難節省，不得長過一百字，非特急事件，不得濫加限卽刻到字樣，非緊急情事，尤難改用快郵，不應動輒發電」，等因，通飭遵照在案。值此剿匪軍電倥忽之時，我軍政機關，自應恪遵斯義也。</p>
<h3>有無綫電合併之原因</h3>
<p>— 雲</p>
<p>交通部自上年五月决定有無綫電合併政策後，首先將上海電報局與無綫電台實行合併改組，其名稱則仍用電報局，。試辦數月，成績極佳，於是南京，北平·天津·漢口四處局台繼續於九月間合併。迨至最近，交通部爲完成全國有無綫電之合併起見，遂令飭下列各處無綫電台，自今日（四月一日）起一律與當地電報局合併；</p>
<p>厦門，福州，靑島、巴縣（卽重慶），廣州，汕頭，宜昌，長沙，成都，濟南·張家口·鄭州·南昌·萬縣·貴陽·烟台·歸綏·長安（卽西安），蘭州，寧夏。</p>
<p>從此全國除邊疆或其他未設電報局之處，仍由獨立之無綫電台負通信之使命外，各地有無綫電完全合爲一體，不復分立。</p>
<p>就一般人之意識言，「合併」二字含有「緊縮」之意義，故往往易認交通部之實行有無綫電合併、僅爲一種消極政策，與公衆通信，不生關係。但電局電台俱爲通信機關，其數愈多則人民愈覺便利，以我國今日之交通狀况言，此類機關正嫌其少，何可亟亟裁併。循是考慮，我人知交部此舉必另有其遠大之理由而不能與一般政府機關之緊縮政策等量齊觀。</p>
<p>夷考有綫電報及無綫電報雖同爲通信最速之利器，但因技術上特性之關係，彼此實各有所長，各有所短。例如有綫電一遇戰事或匪警易遭阻斷，而無綫電則無此虞。反之無綫電遇天電騷擾時工作易受妨礙而有綫電可無此弊。再我國幅圓遼闊，地方不靖，凡邊疆及交通不便各處之電訊，必須充分利用無綫電，以補有綫電之不足。交通部有鑒及此，對於全國有無綫電之聯絡合作及分配報務辦法，向極注意，但實際經騐所得之結果，深覺惟有局台實行合併，方爲最圓滿之合作辦法。其理如下：</p>
<p>甲·减少轉電稽延電局電台傳遞電報，向已不分彼此、互相接轉。例如南京發往廣州之電報，其南京上海間一叚因電局裝有快機，故由陸綫傳遞。至上海廣州間一叚，因無綫電通信較捷，故抵滬後卽交電台傳遞。自電報局與當地電台實行合併後，因聯絡愈形密切，所有以前局台問互相交轉電報必不可免之稽延，更低减至極少度，同時卽係電報之速率，增進至最高度。</p>
<p>乙·增高工作效能以前局台分立時代，雙方組織大體相同，其兩方工作人員及事務之分配，多少有輕重不勻之弊。例如電局及電台各有報差十人，但有時電局來報較忙，其報差頗感不敷調遣，而電台之報差或尚有餘閑。反之有時電台來報較忙時，其弊正復相同。更以此類推，則所有局台之收發員、譯電員、派送員等等，莫不有此情形。合併以後，雙方人員可以統籌支配，對於工作效能之增進，裨益自多。</p>
<p>據交部發表，上海電報局及無綫電台自合併後，其營業較前顯有增進，其他各處，諒亦有相同之趨勢。於此可證一般公衆對於此舉確已感覺便利也。</p>
<h3>電政員工損機救國</h3>
<p>— 仲羅</p>
<p>自一二八事變發生以後，國人受敵機蹂躪之教訓咸認非鞏固空防，不足以禦外悔、而捐購飛機，充實國防，遂為有識人士所奔走呼號，博得社會民眾廣大之贊助。近年以來，各地人士激於愛國熟忱，捐購飛機，至爲踴躍。吾電政員工，負電信交通之重責，愛國向不後人，此次以全體員工捐薪所得，購置飛機三架，業已裝運到華，將於本月四日在首都明故宮飛機塲舉行命名典禮。並定名爲電政員工機第一號第二號第三號以示紀念。記者欣感之餘，用贅數語以實本刊。</p>
<p>按電政員工所捐飛機此次雖僅三架，顧以飛機價值之昂，所費亦屬不貲。且電政界人員薪給微薄捐額有限。而員工散居全國徵集尤難。然於此萬分困難之中，竟能有此成績，足徵凡百事業，苟能萬衆一心，戮力以赴，終必有達到成功之一日。</p>
<p>嘗憶一二八之役中，眞茹國際電臺及上海民國路無綫電總臺，雖在敵機環伺之下，仍努力工作，曾不稍示畏縮，悲壯之景，歷歷猶昨。當時以我國空防缺乏，竟一任敵機之縱橫出沒，毫無抵抗。吾電政員工悲憤填胸，眥漲欲裂。時至今日，電政員工號飛機，固將翱翱於首都天空，而全國電信交通事業，亦有長足之進步，以今視昔，當亦稍自慰藉矣。</p>
<p>雖然。頻年以還，吾國空防，雖經舉國一致努力，略具規模。較之歐美列强，尚覺瞠乎其後。最近德國宣言擴充軍備，據聞每日飛機可造七架，不數月間，可達千架，以視吾電政員工捐購之三架，自不足補國防於萬一。然藉此表示愛國熱忱，與夫提倡國防之旨，實有重大意義存在其間也。</p>
<h3>國際電台最近之種種設施</h3>
<p>— 明</p>
<p>國際電台爲我國自辦之唯一對外通信機關，規模之大，遠非其他外人經營之通信機關所能望其項背，其內部行政管理，辦事手續，工事設施，通信技術等等之科學化現代化，尤爲外人所稱道。以故業務發達，與日俱增，計自該台創立迄今，其營業收入，已較前增加十倍，可見其業務進展之一斑，凡此事實，均係該台同人數年來彈精竭慮，與夫社會人士提倡愛護之功，初非一蹶而就，徼倖所致者也。茲將該台最近之種種設施與改進，擇要摭拾於后，想亦關心該台者所樂聞歟！</p>
<p>（一）創辦機器自行車接收電報　該台因鑒於滬市地面遼闊，偏僻地帶之公衆至該台發電，往返極費時間，雖訂有電話收發電報辦法以濟其窮，但收發報人對於該項辦法，未必盡知利用。故有機器自行車接收電報之創舉。現在機車業經購到，正弁髹漆特別標識，實行之期，卽在目前。今後凡住居本市僻遠處所之公衆或商行，欲拍發國際電報者，可隨時電知該台派員騎車飛馳接報。不必親勞玉趾長途奔波矣。</p>
<p>（二）充實報務問訊處　該台爲便利社會人士對於報務上有所問訊起見，原有問訊處之設立。此項問訊事務，以前係由辦理公報員兼管，有時公報繁忙。應答不免稍緩，近來業務猛增，更感兼顧不周，乃自上月份起，特派諳習英語熟悉報務之業務員四人，畫夜值班，專辦問訊事務，各界人士，如有關於國際電報之問訊事項，請隨時打電話詢問，　（先打該台總機問訊處）自可得到滿意之答復。</p>
<p>（三）開辦電話收發日文電報　該台辦理電話收發電報，歷時已久。惟電話收發日本字母之電報，尚係最近開辦，查自上年中日直達電路通報後，各界要求開放電話收發上項電報者，紛至沓來，該台隨卽着手籌備，自上月起正式實行，成績極爲美滿，良以管理此項職務之人員，均係挑選精通日語，發音淸晰者充任也。</p>
<p>（四）增設稽查報差　該台管理報差投送電報，素極嚴密，凡有來報均計路程之遠近，限時送妥回局，超前則獎，逾限則罰，故對於來報之投送，從無稽延情事，近爲加緊管理起見、特有稽查報差之設，其職務爲查詢報差送報有無稽延遲誤等情事。該台爲永維盛舉，保障公衆利益計，此舉實亦應有之措施也，</p>
<p>該台其他革新改進之事項尚多，限於篇幅，不及備載，惟有一事，頗足一述者：記者昨晤該臺主管人員某君，因讚其進業之隆，設施之善，某君乃默然有傾，始言日：「本台同人對於業務之改進，雖自始迄今，全力以赴、冀貫澈電信商業化之本旨，惟是同人才識有限，掛漏必多，尚望轉告社會人士，儘量指導，並將不滿意本台之處，盡情直告，俾本台集思廣益，於改進方針，有所借鏡，此本台同人所竭誠盼望者也，至過譽之詞，愧不克當。」其虛懷若谷，謙撝有爲之精神，足以昭示該台事業之進展，將永無涯埃也。樂爲之記，以告當世人士。</p>
<h3>從剿匪勝利說到官軍電欠費</h3>
<p>— 葆真</p>
<p>過去兩三年中匪共爲患，不但匪區民衆直接受其茶毒，國內各地一切經濟，建設，亦間接因此而衰落停頓，甚至影響及於民族根本問題。蔣委員長有鑒於攘外必先安內，不惜躬冒矢石親自督師終於得到最後勝利肅淸贛省匪巢。在剿匪時期，軍事消息，動關成敗，端賴電報傳遞，不容片刻延誤。同時剿匪軍隊因軍費支出浩繁，發電報告軍情，如果全價付現、不免困難，特由總司令部規定一種剿題電報書收材料費辦法，咨由交通部轉飭各地局台對於上項軍電每百字暫先牧取材料費五角，其餘報費作爲記帳欠費。（例如官電一通計一百字，照章應收報費五元，現祇先收材料費五角，尚欠四元五角卽作爲欠費列帳）此項官軍電欠費，截至民國二十二年三月份爲止、滾欠數目，已達二千二百餘萬之鉅。電政方而，受官軍電欠費之影響，不但不能力圖擴充機器材料，展設電報綫路，而每月員工薪水，欠發者占百分之七十左右。經濟竭蹶，足見一般先加以閩贛等省因爲剿匪軍事關係、隨時隨地添設電報局所，修造綫路，用費支出，尤屬不贊。電政收入旣因欠費而减少，支出反因與收復匪區，修建電綫和添設局所而倍增，在此入不數出環境中掙扎，當然十分困難。現在匪息敉平，匪區一切農工商業，均在計劃興復，民切來蘇，希望政府對此全國電信交通機關，在可能範國以內，設法由國庫分期攤還一部份官軍電欠費，以資救濟。俾電政經濟基礎，得以穩固，經過相當時期之努力，電信事集，自可逐漸推進，日趨發展，倘爲我「以建設求統一」之政府所樂爲歟？</p>
<h3>電報錯誤的原因和補救方法（續前）</h3>
<p>— 淸華</p>
<p>上面已經將錯誤的種類與原因擇要說過，現在我們要研究怎樣去補救他：補救的方法我已想出幾種寫在下面，要是讀者有何高見，寄給本刊發表，那不僅是我個人的榮幸，實在是造福電信界不淺了！</p>
<p>一、發報人方面應該注意的有三點：（一）電文書寫務須淸楚，最好用打字機抄打，惟須注意打錯時，應用橡皮擦去，切勿貪懶將另一字母打上，以免電局人員看不淸楚。（二）自譯電碼，譯妥後應覆校一遍，以免錯誤。電碼新編交通部刊行的，比較可靠。（三）收報人的店號或姓名住址不要簡略，並且要書寫正確，（洋文的公司名稱或人名相差一二個字母，最易發生誤送）。</p>
<p>二、收報人方面應該注意的，也有三點：（一）對於來電電文中如有疑義之字，可查閱下列二表，試行糾正錯誤之字母或數碼，如無法覓得正確之字母或數碼，然後將電底送交電局免費發電查問。收報人方面如能自行糾正來電的錯誤，那末可以省卻向電局查問的麻煩。（二）對於來電電文中字句、如疑有脫落，可查該電報頭字數欄內所列之實在字數。（字數欄內往往計費字數與實在字數列在一起，例如三五四二字，三五爲計費字數，四二就是實在字數）。與電底上的字數是否相符，如少了幾字，就可確定是電局的錯誤，立卽向共查問。（三）對於發報地名，發報時日或其他各欄，疑有錯誤時，可立卽向電局查問，不必遲疑，也無須自行發電查詢。</p>
<p>三、電局方面補救的方法，有下列四點，都已見諸實行：（一）各繁忙電局特設正誤校對員，對於來往電報、隨時校對，如有錯誤，立卽發電更正，這是補救人工錯誤的最好方法，錯誤同時對於打錯或抄錯電報的報務員，另訂嚴密的懲處辦法，以資儆惕。（二）對於機械及電氣方面，特設工程師及測騐員隨時調整，以期電碼正確。（三）對於誤送電報，特設覆核員，將送電回單與收報人店號或姓名核對，以便遇有錯誤時，立卽交差重送。（四）爲調查收發報人對於電局業務是否滿意起見，特設業務稽查員，隨時向各商行及私人詢問，如有電報錯誤而未曾向電局查問者，卽由該員同局報告上級人員，查明經手人加以罰處，並設法改善。</p>
<p>總之，電報的錯誤，在事實上不能絕對避免，我們希望收發報人注意上述的補救方法與電局合作，那麽錯誤當然可以减少至最低度，電報的效用，更加顯著了！</p>
<h3>考工</h3>
<p>— 一寄</p>
<p>考工兩字，厥稱甚古，周禮有考工篇，允爲我國關於工程記錄之始。諸凡建設，端賴興工，而工程進行，莫不各具章則，所謂有法度可守，有準繩可據，大匠鳩材集工，正不離乎規矩者也。從前交通部，屬於電政司者，有考工科，現則定爲工務科。工務範圍頗廣，於督促進行之餘，考工尤爲重要。茲所厘訂，祇關乎考工者述之，至綫路整理與擴充，容當另篇申述。</p>
<p>有綫電報綫路之建築，其初借材異域，頗仿他國之成規，舊交通部參酌損益，並節取西藉所載，著爲「電報綫路建築須知」一書，成本發行，流傳時久。不過其中間有不適用之處，且技術一道，隨時日而進步，「建築須知」，編印旣歷多年，當時所未及者，就現狀觀察，亦須加以補充，方成完善。近者九省長途電話，交部正在積極進行，綫路興造，計畫周密，於工務方而，尤多改進之處。前人所述，如綫路施行普通交、又，或幻象交叉，當時以鮮有應用，漏焉未列，茲均經技術人員，分別研究，譯定　遺，並精繪各圖，令人一覽卽明，斯卽「長途電話綫路建築規則，工務上可資爲準編者也。</p>
<p>尚有一事，卽自本年一月起，全國電信材料以及工程上測量，所用單位，已改定一律。譬如電綫，從前均以磅計，現則改爲公斤，距離從前以英尺計，現則改爲公里公呎以至公分。經此改定、非特電信工程上有統一之單位，且與國內其他工程技術，亦得一致，如鐵路方面，卽以公里計算長度，沿用旣久，殊無不便也。</p>
<p>此外電報電話以及無綫電之專用名詞或材料名稱，向係譯自外籍，頗不統一：如Imsulator稱爲隔電子，或亦可謂係磁頭；Motot稱爲電動機，或亦呼爲馬達。定名之出入，於應用方面，覺有何所適從之苦，而我國電信上名稱，現旣全用中文，同一物也，稱謂彼此不能一致，亦屬他國所鮮有，且亦不能昭示技術之大同。微聞交通部方面，關於此點，深加注意，不久當有統一電料及技術名稱之發表云。</p>
<h3>美國橫越太平洋之無綫電話臺（績前）</h3>
<p>— 健</p>
<p>發電台共用發射天綫兩付，皆爲平置菱形，築於狄克遜地方，其中一付之方向直對火奴魯魯，他一付之方向則介於爪哇及菲列濱之間。因該兩地由狄克遜觀點測得之角度甚小。用此一付天綫所得之結果，較用兩付天綫分向各該地直射者相差有限也。該兩天綫鐵質雙用輸電綫接連，傳具無週期性，而可適用於寬大之週率範圍。並以與地氣平衡之綫輸電綫均經天綫選電鑰擇接至發射機。</p>
<p>與夏威夷菲利濱爪哇通話</p>
<p>（二）收音台　美國方面之收音台築於加利福尼亞省之帮脫電斯地方，距舊金山北三十五哩。所用收音機一架，係西方電氣公司之D-91719式，其電路爲雙檢波式，凡五至二十一兆週間之週率均可調諧截收。其擴大量約爲一一零A-rV此項收音機係以多個單獨屏蔽之單位，分裝於四調電板及四具繼電器架上組成。計有屏柵高週率擴大器兩級，首次檢波器一，中週率擴大器一（附輸入輸出波帶濾波器）；直綫次級檢波器一。及成音週率擴大器一。並備自動音量控制機件以調節電塲强度之變動。</p>
<p>除上述專供商業通訊之收音機外，尚有特種收音機多架，均附裝揚聲器，乃供監察諸務之用者。其中一架專以在營業通訊時間內調諧各外來之週率，以守聽各方之呼喚。</p>
<p>收音機之電源，乃以二十四及一百三十伏脫乏自動調整發電機供給，電壓極爲穩定。</p>
<p>該台菱形收音天綫三付，亦築於帮脫雷斯。其中兩付皆具週期性，供收聽火奴魯魯發來之兩種週率用。其餘一付具非週期性乃用以收聽爪哇及菲列濱。其方向恰與前述發射天綫同，介於二者之間。因該兩處由美方收音台觀點測得之角度極小，母須分別設置直向天綫也。</p>
<p>收昔機旁裝有天綫電鑰板一塊，俾收音機得轉換接至任何一付天綫。至天、綫與天綫電，板間，則以同心管輸電綫連絡之。</p>
<p>（三）成音週率控制設備　成音週率控制設備，爲無綫電話電路內之主要部份。該項設備之設于舊金山電台者，有西方電氣公司之　式終端控制器一部，附帶轉變聲音之隱秘機件。包括司機用監察及測騐台一席（附音量表示及控制器），佛打阻滯器（odasdelay）及隱秘機件附測騐板與電源板）。所謂佛打機件者，簡言之，乃由多數聲音動作繼電器所組成，可使對方通話人發話時將輸電綫與發射樓相短絡，如已方通話人發話時則收音綫卽與收音機相短絡，其目的在供無綫電路發話與受話方面之交互作用。阻滯機件，則用以將外來及發出兩種成音電流，貯留片秒，使電路內之佛打繼電器得從容動作。而成爲單方向之無綫電通訊電路。</p>
<p>（四）電話交換台　成音週率電路，接入舊金山長途電話管理局內之特設交換台上。此台之裝置遇司機生以擴大器監察電路之狀態時，可不碍及該電路之動作。該交換台上並裝有特製計時表、以記錄通話時間，惟因傳遞上發生障碍而佔去之時間則不許。</p>
<p>（五）接續綫路　發射機及收音機與成音週率終端控制機件問，均係用四綫（一對發射用一對收音用）傳音最良（每秒一百至五千週）之電纜綫路接連。並用電話及電報兩種命令綫路接連其間，以利工作。</p>
<p>四、通訊週率下列各發射週率均爲橫越太平洋無綫電話通訊應用者也：</p>
<p>美國加利福尼亞省狄克遜城發話臺</p>
<p>KWN21,060C/S（14.2m.）</p>
<p>DWU15，355C/S（10.6m）</p>
<p>KWV10，840C/S(27.7m.）</p>
<p>KWX7，610C/S（39.4m.）</p>
<p>KKP16，030C/S（16.7m.）</p>
<p>夏威夷奧庫卡呼庫發話臺　（未完）</p>
<h3>內外箏訊</h3>
<p>— 記者</p>
<p>放箏爲我國古時一種遊戲，每逢春季天朗氣淸之時，兒童輒以此事爲樂。因其有碍電綫，警廳曾加以取締，近來首都爲提倡民衆遊戲起見，與電綫保持相當之距離，特許放箏，定期比賽，遙望天空，龍飛鳳舞，雨花臺畔，士女如雲，頗極一時之盛。頃閱倫敦電氣雜誌，據其美國加州通訊，稱該處亦有放箏遊戲，亟爲迻譯，足見外人注意之周到。</p>
<p>太平洋電氣公司，得警廳與學校之合作，關淤放穩一事，再三向兒童團體，用各種語言說明之。因該地華童甚多，酷愛此種遊戲也。箏之構造，禁止用金屬綫作成。該公司幷製影片表演放箏依近電綫及鐢些電程取箏之危險。演後每一兒童，分給放箏小冊一本云。</p>
<h3>更正</h3>
<p>上期「新聞界與報話欠費」文內第二十四行……「尤不願以改進業務，而增加民衆負担」，手民誤爲「尤以願以改進業務，而增加民衆負担」，意義完全相反。又「答上海顧君Mr．Koo問」，手民誤爲Mr．Kao合併更正。</p>

<h3>福建人口减少千萬</h3>
<p>— 震</p>
<p>最近福建省府統計室的報告，謂福建全省人口，已由二千萬減至九百萬，這卽是說近年來的過程中，福建人口已减少百分之五十五。當然，這樣的人口銳减，恐怕巳經開古今中外的創聞，在此繁榮國家復興民族的聲中，實在是「殊堪注意」的事。</p>
<p>何以呢？因爲有人說過，咱們中國是一個中道式微的破落戶，正因爲如此，一方面家財不知不覺地幾已被前人當盡了，一方面則聊以自慰的回憶着過去的；一方面因「破落」而不自圖振，一方面却得意的以「世界門戶」自傲自驕，好像黃金時代永遠不能忘記。以前我們因列强的侵略，「天朝帝國」，「大漢子孫」是我們的慰藉；但夭朝帝國受堅甲利兵的攻擊就迅速溶解了，「地大物博」，「四萬萬同胞」跟著成爲唯一的自恃。因此近來有一種盛行的「愛國」理論：敵人將全中國佔據了有甚麼要緊呢，四萬萬同胞還是四萬萬同胞、卽或將中華民族征服了也並不怎樣了不得，中國還是中國，咱們這魯殿靈光的文明古國。就始終以這一武器來保障「和平」，正如那一種破落戶，在饔準不繼的時候，還要擺「世家門第」的架子。這種名論，認爲中國不亡的原因，就是我們每個腦經中所有的「四萬萬同胞」這幻影。</p>
<p>可歡的是這一幻影也日益年增的破滅了。前幾年西北的旱災、說是死了好幾千萬或好幾百萬，究竟多少，無從得知。二十年汜濫十幾省的大水災，報紙上看到的是這兒成澤國，那兒全部陸沉，大漢子孫死了多少，也只有天曉得。去年華北一帶的水災、遍及永定河黃河淮河，我們是知道的，江南旱魃爲虐，通信的消息告訴我們，是一個一個的死，一家一家的死。但死了幾多，也難於詳細。近來江北的黑熱病，人民由抽籤來决定誰死的命運、擬聞已有幾十萬到了「十殿閣羅」那裏。此外三千六百萬人民業已成了「華僑」，再加上年來許許多「非命」的死於被殺自殺者，我很懷疑這「四萬萬同胞」究竟已經打了幾拆。福建人口减少的事實說明，我們之以四萬萬人民看作中國不亡的理由，幷拿之來做政治資本的人，將來不知何以自恃。</p>
<h3>幻象</h3>
<p>— 青峯</p>
<p>那是什麼影子呢？</p>
<p>以前，他是離我很遠的，像霧裏的景物，看不眞切。現在他卻漸漸地移動了，漸漸地逼近我了。終於露出了可怕的面目，來到我的跟前。</p>
<p>他的顏色是黑的，他的形體是沉電而龐犬的，—像一座山。不分畫夜，他壓在我的肩上，壓在我的肩頭。</p>
<p>他有那麼一股古怪的魔力，我一看見他，就得打寒戰，而且不自主地會想到了死。</p>
<p>在我做事的時候，他就阻到我的手邊，使我無心做一切的事，一直到我放下了工作，他才離開去，但也只是稍稍地離開一點。在我走路的時候，牠橫亙在我的面前，我不由的就要向後退。於是低倒了頭，像肩上背着幾百斤的担子那麼地步履艱難，像丟了什麼東西那麼地四處尋找，別人招呼我，我聽不見。</p>
<p>牠使我成天地想睡，可是眞正地睡到床上的時侯，却又睡不着。長久地睜着眼，望着天花板，亮的時候望着，暗的時候也望着，直到頭痛，臉熱，耳鳴</p>
<p>他的名子呌「生活」。</p>
<p>朋友們見到我的時候，劈頭總是這麼一句；「你有病？」</p>
<p>我說：『是的，我有點小病。』</p>
<p>其實，我有什麼病？只是那黑影子老纏着我罷了。如果那算中病，那可又不能算是小病呢。我也曾把牠眞的當做了病去訪問過醫生，可是在我說了病狀之後，醫生總是謙虛地謝絕了。我只好自個兒尋我着，尋找那能醬得好這種怪病的藥方。一直到今天，我還沒有能正式地尋到牠，雖然代替的含有毒質的藥劑却尋到了酒。</p>
<p>的確的，的，酒，對於驅逐那個黑影，是有相當的功效的。當我醉了的時候，我的頭會旋轉，我的耳目會失了作用；那一煞那間，我是悠然了。我看不見牠猙獰的雄姿，也聽不見牠的像風潮似的怒吼。牠的聲影，在我的從腦中蒸發出來的水氣和沸湯似的嘶嘶的嗚呌中消失了。然而醉的時候到底是很短的呢。並且這怪藥劑的副作用也是很古怪的：</p>
<p>『愈糊塗，愈淸醒；愈忘得乾凈，愈記得分明。』</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>於是在它的威力消去的時候，那黑影的輪廓更加鮮明了，它的分量更加沉重了，而我的悲傷和憤怒的感覺也更加深切了。有時直使我悲傷得想狂笑，憤怒得想向每個人去求饒。然而至今我還沒有這樣做，為的是自已到底是弱者，不願被當做了瘋子。</p>
<p>唉，到什麼時候你才向我告別呢？你這古怪的巨靈呵！我是缺乏著招待你的能力呢。</p>
<h3>雨巷</h3>
<p>— 斯全</p>
<p>灰黯的天空仿佛蓋在警察亭子的鉛皮頂上，挾著沙屑的狂風，了陳緊一陳地吹過這巷口，祥泰兌店的招牌就像鐘擺似的沒有停息的時候。老關是個五十開外的老頭，架著老花眼鏡，把　像八美園湊在眼鏡邊上上下移動，幾乎像獵犬用鼻子去嗅尋野獸的蹤跡似的那樣認真。</p>
<p>巷口一輛黃包車停了下來，一塊大洋「晶」的一聲在櫃臺上響了，老關急忙拋去八美圓去迎接今天稀有的主顧。當他接起龍洋來審視的時候，無意識到天色已是暗下來了，於是目光從眼鏡的上緣向對街望去；那邊是一個飯攤，在盞晶亮的電燈底下圍著一群黃包車夫。他知道現在是七句鐘。</p>
<p>把主顧送走後，扭亮了那盞五支光的電炬，這是他每天結算賬目的時候。可是今天錢板上數得清的幾個銀角，他仿佛賭氣似的一下子都拋進櫃箱裏，上了鎖。剛想再去取過　像八美圓來，那高個子的警察一腳踩過店堂裏。</p>
<p>「生意好？—媽的又下雨來！」</p>
<p>說話聲音仿佛同他一百八十磅開外的身子同時跌進來，一百反手拉開櫃臺內的抽屜，熟練地抽過一枝金鼠牌。老關照例是含首了事；隨即把賬臺上的火柴拋過去。但是今天他忘了這例行的公事，慢慢地踱過來先向街頭望去，雨點撒野地酒著，他的頭沒有探出櫃臺，面上已著了電燈被水果店收了進去，阿根在油布傘下忙手忙腳地收市了。黃包車都散開，只是愈下愈急的大雨把街頭打成白霧一片。</p>
<p>「一天只做塊把錢生意。昨天水果店裏來兌角子，說香蕉，橘子論堆賣還沒有人要！老總，你說？」</p>
<p>「媽的！」那個把煙擲挺有樣地含在嘴角，他沒有聽清楚老關嚕咕著些什麼，毫不在意他把「媽的」沖口罵了出來。</p>
<p>老關踱回身來，老總終究還是同情他的，雖然每天揩油一枝金鼠牌香煙，他不是罵了起來嗎？或許他有權力禁止那「赤老」開門！想著就把火柴抓了過來，並且客氣地劃亮了湊上去。</p>
<p>「×伊拉！隔了一條馬路，生意就格能好！赤老！」</p>
<p>那個明白了老關的意思。那邊新馬路開了一家煙兌店，電車站頭就在他門前，而且規模大，貨色多，這條巷裏的祥泰主顧，幾乎都被搶了過去。老關從前做過二十來塊錢一天生意的。</p>
<p>「媽的，伊拉地段好！」那個深深地吸了一口，兩道白煙從鼻孔裏沖出來。</p>
<p>老關失望地退了兩步，背脊被錢櫃擋住了，他望著那枝金鼠牌的圓印燒去了一半，一股濃煙　的白煙把那個巨大的腦袋隱藏了去。他旋過頭來，門外一片雨聲，嘩拉嘩拉地。就果店也歇了。</p>
<p>「老總，下雨天嘸末生意哉！」這顯然是逐客令。老關覺得這最好的報復辦法。那個沒有答話的餘裕，他掮起店堂裏作為坐地的門板，一個年青漢子似的乒乓著把牌的碰起來。</p>
<p>老總遲疑了半響，終於把燃蒂一摔，披上雨衣，頭也不回地向警察亭走了去。</p>
<p>「赤老！」老關闔上了最後一扇門，目光射到地上一個塑像八美圓，被反鞋腳跡了個稀爛。</p>
<h3>雨的回憶</h3>
<p>— 華木</p>
<p>對於雨，現在可失了喜悅的情趣了。一到雨天，心頭就像塞了一塊棉花，又沉悶又虛空的怪難受。這個時候，常常是不言不語的昨到床上去，細細的回味著幼年時代的心情，如何在雨天活躍。</p>
<p>當睡夢中給雷聲驚醒過來，燐青的閃電，打窗格子上割劃而過，轟天撼地的雷響，破空而落，震得心頭突突的跳，忙把頭朝被內一縮，鑽伏在母親的懷裏。這個時候，雖然為著雷響惹起無邊的甘心恐怖；但聽著打在屋瓦上西哩沙咧的雨點，心裏又暗暗的歡喜，總是希望這樣一刻不停的落到天亮就更好。</p>
<p>第二天天一亮，就興沖沖的赤著雙腳跑到外邊去。哇，滿溪滿田都漲滿了水，嘩嘩唎唎的；無數白翅膀的水烏滿段滿埭的飛著，鳴著。把褲管一擲，就帶跳帶叫的奔上田堤，溪邊；涉水，跳提，早把早飯丟到腦背。等到給母親叫回去，一身衣裳早已弄得濕淋淋的了。</p>
<p>盛夏天熱，用稻收完了，大人們也希望下幾陣大雨涼爽一下，好翻土作第二次的耕　。當午後一陣風來，西南角上蓋著一塊烏雲，禾坪裏飛塵走沙的打旋風。這時個常常都給母親禁在房子裏。雷聲起後，呼荷呼荷的雨聲，即由遠而近。隔著竹簾望著果園裏的龍眼樹，垂著沉甸甸的龍眼，搖過去，擺過來，受了風雨的搖打，一顆一顆脫蒂墜下，打在泥地上博博篤篤的響。心裏就盡在計算。雷聲一停，雨點一弱，怎樣能夠搶先跳過天階，拐過小巷……果然，不久雲頭上過，雨息雷停。歡天喜地從果園裏提了一小藍子龍眼走回來，在廊子裏就跟著祖母們邊剝邊笑的吃著。</p>
<p>有時連著下了三天雨，河水一漲，溪裏的小沒處排洩，下段一帶的水田就變成了個大洋湖，渺渺茫茫的，把泥穴裏的蛇，大蛙，蟋蟀，都趕到上段田埭上來，每天就打夥兒的去捉大蛙，蟋蟀，打到一條花蛇，還可以送到藥鋪子裏去賣。水退時就撐著竹排子去捉河鯉……</p>
<p>跟著年齡的增長，離開了故鄉，把生活寄放在流浪的波浪裏，故鄉的影子已漸漸的後遠了。一到雨天，也換了兩樣心情，沉悶，虛空，厭煩，再不會逗起喜悅的好感。</p>
<p>我悲惻著，童年而今是消失了！</p>
<h3>景元</h3>
<p>— 天騏</p>
<p>走出門來，天剛剛發亮。景元仰起頭望望東邊天空，一片高曠，素淨。放射著白色的光影。濛濛的晨霧從田野裏流散開來，綱著前面的松林，黑森森的　留著殘夜的陰影。禾坪上一堆一堆的臥著穗實累累的稻草。狗兒靜靜的臥在那裏，聽到有人來了機警地抬起頭來四目楞楞的向人注視。院子裏這時也沉沉地送出悠長的雞鳴，向四村播送。</p>
<p>父親腋下挾著一把油布傘走在前頭，母親擔著行李跟在後面。景元這時，腳下沉澱澱的似給什麼東西絆住一般。有許多話要說出來，一到喉頭又給什麼梗住了。望望父親的背影，回頭又看著低頭走著的母親，心裏就隱隱作痛。</p>
<p>將到松林的轉彎道上，景元忽停住腳向前叫了一聲爸，翻過身來望著前面的家屋，和禾坪裏堆著的稻草，想起自己這次一到番邦就不知到什麼時候　得回來。父親雖還結實，做得田事，但是一年到頭流盡汗血都還種不出三籍穀的一塊水田，以後的日子又將怎樣過去？眼前的傷離，未來的憂患，適得他一陣酸痛，眼淚簌簌的落下來了。</p>
<p>「景兒，自古道老天下負苦心人，總望汝到了番邦，好好運氣，三年五載賺些錢回來……」</p>
<p>母親一邊放下行李，一邊說著，喉頭已給什麼梗住了似的搴起衣角擦眼淚，又繼續著說。</p>
<p>「娘什麼都放得心下，就是想不到辛苦一生還不能給汝娶個媳婦就放汝去千裏外的番邦尋活。」</p>
<p>母親嗚咽著，景元這時心裏就像有無數的尖針在心坎裏刺著似的難過。父親站在前頭，看樣子也在那裏拭淚。</p>
<p>「媽，我過到番邦自曉好好做人，只是捨不得去下爸媽在家受苦……」</p>
<p>「蠢兒子，爸媽年紀雖然有了，也還做得吃得，就只是……」</p>
<p>「我前回已和爸爸說過，益敬公的利錢長此下去，利上加利終不是個辦法，不如索性把田抵給他，一刀兩斷落得乾淨，但爸總說捨不得，給了人沒田耕」。</p>
<p>「就是啊，僅有這一塊小田，一旦抵給人家，一日在餐粥將向那裏來？」</p>
<p>「橫豎也耕不到三　　，不抵給人也一樣餓肚子，抵了倒可不要負利錢。媽，還是叫爸抵了罷。我做滿一年「新客」後就寄錢回來。」</p>
<p>景元說到這裏，似乎眼前光明了些。他明白，他這次離家飄洋過海到番邦去，三年兩年以後就可捆載榮旋，振興家業的。想到這裏，他就翻過身去催著母親趕路了。</p>
<p>「爸爸。媽媽，我做滿一年新客後就寄錢回來。」</p>
<p>開船的時候，景元站在船舷向父親和母親說著，眼淚又滾下來。</p>
<h3>魚村小景</h3>
<p>— 拓人</p>
<p>從鎮上到魚村雖只有十幾裏路，但跑起來卻要一個多鐘頭。因沒並不是一條坦道，而是一條崎嶇不平的小山路。</p>
<p>跑這條路算起來已經走過三次了，但我還不能起憶清楚，到了遇有參差的小徑時，還是要等著問鄉下人的。終算是好，轉過了一個山頭，就遇著一個也是到魚村去的人，他是鎮上一家大魚行的夥計。他合我一道跑，好似知道我的苦衷，把腳步放得特別慢。一面走著一面就和他談起來。</p>
<p>「近來的生意好嗎？聽說去年魚行都很不錯。」我先開口問他。</p>
<p>「生意好壞都不一定，要天氣好合碰運氣。去年並不怎樣好，現在比不得從前了，一擔魚要過幾次捐，還有什麼好？」他似乎怕我不信的眼睛朝著我望。</p>
<p>「捕魚看天氣是實在的，為什麼還要碰運氣？」我問。</p>
<p>「你們外行人不知道，碰運氣是了要緊的。要是運氣壞，同是一隊船出海去，人家的裝得一艙一艙的回來，他卻是空著，有時還會遇著風浪哩！你信嗎？老板都要靠運氣的。」</p>
<p>「唔」</p>
<p>崎嶇的路面上的石碎合沙子，一粒粒地滾進鞋子裏去，跑不幾步就得脫一下鞋子，要不然會擦出水泡來。可是那些腳夫，他們一個都擔著幾十斤重魚，赤著足，卻不感到碎石子的擦著腳皮，跑起路還是那末快，這使我對他們起了敬仰的心，感到自已的懦弱無能。</p>
<p>在這路上來往的人，除了擔魚的腳夫合魚村的人，很少有別人在這裏行走的。像我這樣，是偶然間有一二個而已。至於鎮上的老板們或村裏的警官，他們上落這條路。大都是坐轎，就是那稅局裏的職員或巡兵，也很少走路的。</p>
<p>路是漸漸地平坦了，走了穀口，就是一條小泥路。在這一條路上，除了高山峻嶺之外，很少有一畝農田。一直的到了走出穀口的這條小路上，兩旁才有田野。</p>
<p>「幾年沒到這兒來，畢竟是變了。」走進了魚村，我就有這樣的感覺。跑得已經麻木了的腿，也沉重地遲緩下來。</p>
<p>魚村，這因產魚而得名的村子裏，人沒有　，每個壯年或老年的男人，還都是赤著背的在海邊搬運著那在狂風大浪之中辛苦得來的魚。婦人們小孩們也還是赤著足的在沙灘上檢拾著被擯棄的小魚回家去當飯吃。海也一樣的沒有變，那澎湃的潮濤也還是好似巨狼張開著大口的等著吞　冒險的魚人。街道，濘滑潮濕的街道，房屋，將成廢墟頹垣的魚夫之家，一切都如舊的蒼老。只有那海岸邊的一座新屋，高掛著大招牌的稅局，在蒼老的廢墟上聳立著。一擔擔地魚，加重著負荷的從稅局的後門送出。魚夫們的血汗，他們從狂風大浪之中捨著生命得來的收獲，一擔擔地蓋上著紅印，一擔擔地變成了他人所有的向著城市送去了。</p>
<p>魚在籃子晨一年過一年活活的跳，魚夫卻在紅印之下一年過一年的壓死了。</p>

<h3>打破害人的迷信羅吉柏萊易的怪行</h3>
<p>— 素因</p>
<p>羅吉柏易萊（Roger　Pryor）說：「你指給我一但迷信看看、我可以打破它，如同戳破一個水泡一術容易、我是惟一的演員，背在化妝室裏噓嘯的。我常常將我的帽子，擲在床止。我每天看見了梯子、就毫不遲疑的從下面鐵了過去。一根自來火點三支香烟，是我的拿手戲。我一個人生平所打破的鏡子，比好萊塢一切演員所打破的合併起來還要多、我和朋友在馬路上走路的時候，最喜歡繞着電燈柱子走。雨傘在我家裏，是常常在屋內撐着的。我每天早晨穿鞋，總是左脚先穿的。我最喜歡的數目就是十三。」</p>
<p>以上是一位好萊塢新進的明星柏萊易，關於電影從業員崇尙迷信的箴勸。他說：「電影事業是世界各種事業中，迷信最多的一個。電影從業員之中，尙然並不個個是迷信甚深的人。一隻黑貓在他們的面前竄過去，或者不足使他們驚怪。但是倘使你要尋一位電影從業員，他是一個迷信都沒有的那是一椿很困難的事。」</p>
<p>柏萊易在好萊塢是一個新人物，但是他在舞臺上却資格甚老。他的父親是個軍樂隊的指揮官，他從小就會玩十餘種的樂器。他的成爲紐約舞臺明星，還在李屈山之前。現在環球公司將他羅致了來。他的歌喉，我們以後可以在許多歌舞片中聽到。</p>
<p>他說他從小就是一個最迷信的人。他無論說什麼話，凡遇見有些不吉利的意思的，他就要將手指導擊着木頭，敲得手指骨都疼痛了。每一個月的第一天，他從床上醒過來，他一定先要喊一聲“Rabbit”他情願斷了一只手，不情願一個月的開始，說任何別的一個字的。但是後來他父親的一位朋友，看了這孩子迷信得着實可憐，就開始勸導他，用許多事來證明，各種迷信都是不確的。但是他還不相信。後來他自己用了多年秘密觀察的功夫，才决定各種迷信，都　是建築於無意識的恐怕上的。因此，他就開始他的打破迷信的工作了，尤其是在舞臺或銀幕上的演員方面。</p>
<p>他說：「優伶或演員，是一種特殊階級的人，因此他們有特別的習慣和迷信。往往平常人所不注意的，他們却很重視而忌諱。但是這種迷信在演員們中，貽害亦最深。我有一位同事，他的年齡能力，却和他相同。他有一次得了感冒之症，以致喪失了一個很好的表演機會。他病好之後，他忽然想起他病之前，曾打破過一面鏡子。照着普通的說法，打破一面鏡子就是七年的壞運。因此，他自己就傷心悔恨，以爲一生事業都完了，他雖是受過敎育的人，但他却接受了他的命運，而不再求進取了。即此一端就可以知道迷信害人之深了。這亦就是我决心和迷信奮鬥的開始。」</p>
<p>據柏萊易的經駝，十三是他很幸運的數目。他第一次登臺，座上觀客祇有十二個人，但是後來越來越多，接連演了四個星期，聲名就此鵲起了。他到了輪盤賭，他專門押十三，常常贏許多錢。他最近的一張歌舞片，是開始於十三日的。他到好萊塢，亦是在一個十三日。</p>
<p>關於在化妝室中噓嘯，那是演員們最忌諱的一件事。他們說，演員在化妝室中噓嘯，可以使戲院着火，或使布幕倒下來，至少他會被開除的。但是柏萊易有一次，被派充了一個他不願意扮演的角色。戲院經理不答應他更換，亦不准他辭職。他沒有法子，就開始在化妝室中噓嘯，靜待着迷信的證實，或者他會被開除的。但是他却接連演了五個月，並沒有被開除。從此以後，他就天天在化妝室裏噓嘯了。</p>
<p>柏萊易說：「我在有意無意之中，打破了許多同事們的迷信，但是有意無意之中，也得羅了許多朋友，有一次，我在一次宴會中碰倒桌上的鹽餅。照規矩我應當抓起一把鹽來，從我　厲上向後擲過去，不然就會有不幸之事發生的。我旁邊坐的一位女客，看着我靜待我如法泡製。但是我明知而不爲。那位女客竟驚駭莫名的害怕起來，好像橫禍之來，會連帶到她的身上的。這是我生平所遇到迷信最深的一個女人了。」</p>
<p>柏萊易的格言是：「忘記恐懼。破除迷信。不然就是你自貽伊戚了。」</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3>評「鐘樓怪客」</h3>
<p>— 華倫</p>
<p>Secret　of　the　Chateau　大上海映</p>
<p>這張偵探片「鐘樓怪客」，和兩月前在南京映的，Lambert　Hillyer導演，賴爾夫。白萊梅主演的「神秘古鐘」差不多。後者的謀殺案中心在遺產承繼的爭奪，這是爲了盜竊一本古版的聖經。至於在神秘的外衣下，憑藉一種無稽的傳說，以增加疑竇，移轉與渚混觀衆的注意，便於空洞無物的劇本之演出這一方式，却完全是同樣的。</p>
<p>在這殺人越貸的案件，隨着社會的不安，與一部分人們的生活糜爛程度之增進的現在，偵探影片的接連着生產，原是有着牠的客觀條件之必然的。但是同時由於生活方式的進步，實際上發生的殺人越貨的案情與手法，也與過去，大爲不同，各人競競然利用着科學技術的現在，而製片者還斤斤較量着神秘外衣的運用，在無稽的傳說中跑着走馬燈式的製作這類片子，未免太陳舊了吧！</p>
<p>這兒寫述一個古堡中的貴族死後不久，有承繼權的人都邀了朋友來商量分配與品評遺產的一個晚上，堡樓上的古鐘，突然自動地饗了，在全家恐怖中，道產管理人被殺了，而遺物之一的珍貴聖經也同時失去。案情在偵察中剛展開來時，就捉到了犯人。但是馬上又因女主人被暗殺的案件岔了開來，案情重又墜入離奇費解的雲霧中去。自然，後來所謂怪客也者的終於被獲，讓那被認爲兇手的犯人因禍得福地會倒入有情人的懷中，這也是此類故事必有的結束。</p>
<p>由這樣平常與老調的故事，欲求其演成怎樣成功的作品，原不是容易做得到的。這兒，導演者除了說明故事之外，總算還有着若千成功的地方。</p>
<p>首先是疑雲重重的空氣佈置的充份，在謀殺與盜竊案發生之前，就使有關係的各人有着可疑之點，被偵探早已認定，而且由自己經介紹過的少女裘麗是最犯嫌疑的一人。共餘如在拍賣塲中賊頭賊腦，和在古堡作客時設法弄得開門關門不發聲響的阿孟，以及挨駡討厭的男僕，行色忽忽的敎授，都擔受着干係。作者雖是使那著名的竊賊盧先事先一再出現在裘魔的房中，事情發生後，又讓他來找裘麗而被捕，想把注意集中在他身上。其實這種故意的做作，不待後來女主人隆比夫人的被殺，由於他會自首地來找尋假妻子這不近情理的舉動，就可以看出所謂怪客者究竟是繼的。至於少女裘麗由於她認識了保羅—少年公子，美術家時的熱愛情形，對於同夥慮先的厭倦的表示，殺巴都的槍聲響時她的驚呼等，也足以由最大的嫌疑中，—她是偵探認識與盧先派來的偷書賊，事情發生前的一剎那，明明帶着假鑰匙與手槍出去的—，輕放出來的。</p>
<p>總之，犯罪的空氣佈置，與翻案式的水落石出，這是「鐘樓怪客」較好的地方。</p>
<p>在參觀聖經，鐘聲突響等塲面的畫面織接也頗可取。自然？恐怖的氣息，暗淡的光影，是一般偵探片中所常見的。</p>
<p>演技平平，克拉克威廉的保羅在這裏倒沒有多少特長之處。還是演裘麗的克蘭陶德與偵探馬洛的較佳。</p>
<h3>評「希特拉青年突擊隊巷戰記」</h3>
<p>— 蘋</p>
<p>The　Storm　Troope　—新光</p>
<p>對於這樣的影片，我們幾乎無話可說。這樣武斷的宣傳影片，難道我們還能在其中我着多少對於我們藝術修養有益的東西麼？我們一點也不反對影片應有其宣傳敎育意義，但是我們却不敢贊成武斷的宣宣傳。譬如說在中國目前，反帝抗日的影片，自有其宣傳作用，因爲這是廣大的觀衆所迫切要求的，在這誰也不否認這種影片眞實的抓住了廣大觀衆的需要，巳經决定了其藝術的價値。然而武斷宣傳却並不如此，它唯一的目的，便是誇大宣傳，甚至於可以不根據事實。似那强烈的嗎啡興奮劑，隨着長長的針管注入人們的心臟，强迫地使人們興奮，即使是不必興奮，或者是不需要興奮的，也不能不被動的興奮起來</p>
<p>很顯明的，國社黨在德國秉政之後，除了瘋狂的備戰，或者焚燒書籍，驅逐大批學者或藝術家們出國之外，到底給與了我們什麼好的印象呢？說到這裏，我們不能不聯想起偉大的導演柏勃斯忒，優秀的演員瑪琍黛德琳，康勒維德之葷，到現在還是流浪在外國。這些電影藝人的悲哀，乃是正義的觀眾們可以想像得到的。電影藝術直接的受着殘酷的政治干涉，那是何等可怕的現象啊！</p>
<p>至於技術的觀察，或者是在製片技巧說到一些，我以為也沒有多大的必要。反正這兒出現的也是沒有多大深刻表現的演員，導演祇是盡了武斷宣傳的責任。這些，在梟雄的卍字黨領袖看來，也許有其偉大的成就，然而在我們外國的觀衆看來，却感覺是無謂的浪費了。</p>
<h3>好萊塢珍聞一束</h3>
<p>— 馥</p>

<h3>Prerequisite Problems for Promoting Health Education</h3>
<p>— All</p>
<p>Our nation has always been known for its pursuit of peace. However, this thirst for peace has gradually led to a state of weakness. The lack of physical training and the failure to adopt scientific methods of health preservation are the main causes of our frailty. In this fiercely competitive world, those who indulge in pleasure-seeking are everywhere. If we do not awaken and change our bad habits in time, we will inevitably become the prey of others. The government authorities have been vigorously promoting military training in recent years, from students to civil servants to citizens, to provide appropriate correction, which is well-intentioned. However, physical training is one thing, and promoting hygiene is another. Although they seem to be separate, they are actually mutually dependent and complementary. Neglecting one is ultimately futile. Recently, the Department of Health plans to establish health education committees in various schools to promote health education. Dr. Stampar, a consultant of the League of Nations, is also actively designing to improve hygiene. This, coupled with the Central People's Movement Committee's stipulation of a citizen training outline to be implemented regularly, forms a mutually reinforcing situation. If we proceed in this way, advancing on both fronts and striving diligently, we may rejuvenate the national spirit.</p>
<p>Promoting health education is easier said than done. To achieve tangible results, the difficulties are tenfold greater than implementing citizen training. The latter is a superficial movement, while the former is a transformation of the inner self. Compulsory training can be implemented with a single order, but promoting health education requires individual awareness. As far as our current situation is concerned, at least 70% of people in society lack health awareness. In poor and remote areas, even the concept is absent, let alone awareness. How can promotion be easy under these circumstances? Furthermore, hygiene today is vastly different from the so-called "health preservation" of ancient times. The purpose of ancient health preservation was to prolong life, while the main goal of modern hygiene is to compete for survival. Prolonging life is a vertical approach to self-preservation, with a passive meaning. Competing for survival is a horizontal approach to development, with an active meaning. Understanding this, we know that in the process of promoting health education, we must rely on science and cannot simply repeat the old passive views. The identification of disease sources, the prevention of epidemics, the elimination of germs, and the inspection of food all depend on the guidance and cooperation of scientific medicine. Scientific medicine is thus the central figure in promoting health education. However, scientific medicine has not yet gained the full trust of the public in our society, which will undoubtedly make promotion even more difficult. Therefore, we believe that the prerequisite for promoting health education is how to make scientific medicine accessible to society.</p>
<p>The failure of scientific medicine to reach the public is partly due to the obstruction of anti-scientific forces and partly due to the difficulty in eradicating the conservative ideas of the Chinese people. The failure of some scientific doctors to fulfill their duties also often gives opponents an excuse to reinforce conservative barriers. How to rectify the past and plan for the future can be summarized in four points as far as our humble views are concerned.</p>
<p>First, intellectuals should have a clear understanding and assistance. Among the Chinese people, who are rich in conservative ideas, intellectuals have clearer minds and are more adaptable to the environment. They should have no doubt about their inclination towards scientific medicine. However, due to personal relationships and friendships, they often adopt ambiguous arguments. This is understandable in human nature. However, considering the decline of our national strength and the desire to escape the shackles of weakness, how can we seek alternatives to science? We should therefore be rational and change our ways, giving support and assistance to scientific medicine.</p>
<p>Second, patients should have full understanding and faith. Ordinary patients tend to have two contradictory psychological attitudes towards doctors. At the beginning of the consultation, they look up to the doctor as if he were a god, hoping that the medicine will cure the disease immediately. However, after two or three visits without improvement, they discard the doctor like dirt. They do not realize that the condition is complex and cannot be cured overnight. When there is a chance of improvement, they switch to another doctor, thus making it impossible to recover quickly. Therefore, patients must remember that they should be careful when choosing a doctor, and trust the doctor after entrusting him with their care. Do not cause irreparable worries with impetuous emotions. Follow the doctor's instructions and provide relevant information for reference. This will improve the effectiveness of the treatment and avoid unnecessary misunderstandings.</p>
<p>Third, doctors themselves should have practical connections and efforts. In today's transitional Chinese society, doctors not only bear the responsibility of treatment but also need to educate and guide. When receiving patients, they should adopt a sincere attitude and give gentle explanations to give patients a good impression, which can be used to spread the word. Anything that may cause resentment from patients should be avoided. As for the relationship between colleagues, it should be practical and close. Mutual supervision and correction are necessary. If there is a need for joint research in clinical practice, efforts should be made to learn from others to achieve success. If dishonesty or misconduct is discovered among colleagues, efforts should be made to correct or sanction them. Do not be biased against the truth or beautify oneself for personal gain. Ensure that the entire medical profession is not misunderstood by the outside world due to the unwillingness of one or two people. At the same time, make greater efforts to contribute to the general public's belief in science.</p>
<p>Fourth, administrative agencies should have strict promotion and supervision. It goes without saying that administrative agencies should use their inherent power to engage in the promotion of health undertakings. A simple starting point is to pay attention to the management of public medical affairs. Generally, doctors who set up their own clinics in cities cannot avoid charging high fees due to the cost of living, and the poor and sick cannot help but sigh. Only public hospitals charge low fees, which can be a relief for the masses. Since there are more opportunities for contact, the impact is naturally greater. If one or two doctors working in these hospitals are unwilling to perform well, relying on the fixed salary and acting carelessly, the resulting bad consequences are unimaginable. The authorities should strictly screen these doctors, improve their salaries, clarify their responsibilities, and impose strict punishments to avoid inadvertently creating public estrangement from science, thus creating greater obstacles to the promotion of health education.</p>
<p>In short, it has become an urgent requirement of the times for scientific medicine to seek integration with the entire society. Establishing a foundation for the promotion of health education and providing a remedy for the decline of national strength are of great importance and cannot be ignored. This is why we do not hesitate to speak at length and seriously advise the Chinese people.</p>
<h3>Doihara Returns to Shimonoseki, Discusses Sino-Japanese Cooperation, Plans to Make Important Recommendations to the Government</h3>
<p>(Shimonoseki) Lieutenant General Doihara returned to Japan on the 31st morning aboard the Kanpu Liaison Steamer to provide recommendations on promoting Sino-Japanese cooperation. He boarded the express train east at 9:15 a.m. At the Sanyo Hotel, he told people that during his trip to China, he conveyed his personal beliefs to important Chinese figures. In general, all parties expressed great support for his views. The recent efforts of the Kuomintang to revive the Eastern spirit and move forward on the path of regeneration are admirable. As for why Sino-Japanese friendship should occur, both sides should examine the cause-and-effect relationship. Economic cooperation should be encouraged through mutual concessions between the two countries. However, the Chinese government is currently facing financial difficulties. If assistance is provided immediately, it may draw bandits into the vortex of Chinese internal affairs, which would be undesirable. The purpose of his trip to the east is merely to report on his experiences in China and does not involve any so-called important recommendations. He plans to stay for a week before returning to Manchuria. (31st Jiji News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japanese Military Plans to Implement a Four-Year Plan to Strengthen the Air Force, Add Air Regiments Nationwide, and Intensify Training for Pilots</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The army has approved a four-year plan to urgently strengthen aviation and air defense forces, allocating 48.34 million yuan in the tenth fiscal year budget. Preparations for implementation are currently underway. Starting in April, the army will add army aviation schools and aviation regiments, as outlined in the military order. The main points of the plan are as follows: (1) Aviation regiments will be added in the following locations: (a) Central Japan, (b) Northern Korea, (c) Taiwan (under investigation). The locations for adding these regiments have been tentatively determined, and implementation will begin in the tenth fiscal year. (2) Reform of aviation schools: Separate the technical students and juvenile airmen within the current Tokorozawa Aviation School and establish the Army Aviation Technical School and the Army Juvenile Airmen School.

<h3>Foreign Minister Hirota Refreshes Economic Diplomacy, Formulates Concrete Plan</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Foreign Minister Hirota has formulated a plan to strengthen the content of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Bureau of Commerce and plans to submit it to the Cabinet for deliberation to promote its realization. The main points of the Foreign Minister's plan to refresh economic diplomacy are as follows: (1) Administrative officials from the Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Commerce and Industry, Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, Ministry of Communications, and Ministry of Colonial Affairs who are in charge of matters related to the Bureau of Commerce may be temporarily appointed as administrative officials of the Bureau of Commerce of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and concurrently hold positions in order to cultivate the handling of foreign affairs. At the same time, these concurrently serving administrative officials may be appointed as consuls and consuls general to facilitate smooth economic diplomacy. (2) To plan for increasing the number of commercial officers, it is planned to select suitable personnel from both the government and the private sector in order to complete the overseas commercial information network. (3) To develop Japanese commercial rights, efforts must be made to cultivate outstanding merchants and enable them to stand at the forefront overseas and spread throughout the world. (31st Jiji News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) To prepare for the intensification of the world economic war, the Ministry of Commerce and Industry will replace the knowledge consultants planned by former Minister of Commerce and Industry Matsumoto with the highest guiding body for the control of Japan's foreign trade, which will be parallel to the Trade Deliberation Council within the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The establishment of this new trade bureau consultant system is currently in the stage of administrative preparation and is nearing completion. The official system will be announced on April 1st and will include the following: (1) Trade Bureau consultants will be appointed by the Minister of Commerce and Industry after submitting a request to the Cabinet and selecting those with rich knowledge and experience. (2) Trade Bureau consultants will be treated as Chokunin officials, but those who have a main post will still be treated according to their main post. These consultants will assist in matters of trade control. The main personnel must be entrusted to powerful figures from the private sector. It is heard that candidates such as Takashi Isaka, Baron Seinosuke Go, Viscount Kyoshiro Inoue, Yunosuke Yasukawa, and Viscount Masatoshi Okouchi are highly regarded.

<h3>Belgian Senate Passes Currency Devaluation Bill, Zyren Cabinet's Position Consolidated</h3>
<p>Brussels The Senate recently expressed its confidence in the Zyren government with 110 votes in favor, 20 votes against, and 19 abstentions, passing the currency devaluation bill and granting the government special powers in financial matters. Socialist and Catholic Party members all supported the government, while Liberal Party members had mixed attitudes. (30th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>Brussels After the Currency Devaluation Bill proposed by the Zyren Cabinet was passed by the parliament, the government decided to devalue the gold parity of the national currency, the Belga, by 28% and will suppress excessive price increases. Those who take the opportunity to manipulate the market will also be severely punished. The stock exchange, which was previously ordered to suspend business, will resume operations tomorrow. Exchange control will also be implemented immediately, using the exchange rate after the 28% devaluation as the exchange standard. The government also announced that there is currently a large foreign demand for Belgian securities. (31st Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>Brussels The passage of the currency devaluation bill by the Senate yesterday can be considered a personal victory for Prime Minister Zyren, as the Senate was originally strongly opposed to this measure. It is said that Zyren was disheartened by the fact that half of the Catholic Party and most of the Liberal Party members voted against the bill during yesterday's vote in the House of Representatives and intended to resign. However, he was persuaded by key figures, especially King Leopold III, to abandon his intention to resign. Now that he has won a victory in the Senate, his position is even more consolidated. (31st Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>Brussels Although the discussion of the abandonment of the gold standard in Belgium has been widely publicized for two weeks, this morning's events are still a major blow to most of the public, as they have deep experience with drastic currency changes. During the parliamentary debate on the devaluation of the Belgian currency, all parties attacked Prime Minister Zyren. Former Prime Minister Jasper even strongly opposed the need for any devaluation of the Belgian currency. In some industries, the impact of the devaluation has already been seen, with prices rising by a quarter, and the national population is rushing to stores, buying everything regardless of price. If the government cannot cope with this phenomenon, the currency devaluation may only cause losses to those with little savings, and Zyren's government will eventually lead the political situation into a state of complete chaos.

<h3>Former Spanish Prime Minister Lerroux Ordered to Form a Cabinet</h3>
<p>Madrid President Zamora yesterday afternoon ordered former Prime Minister Lerroux to form a coalition government. The three seats in the previous government, justice, labor, and agriculture, were all held by Catholic Party members. They resigned from the government in opposition to the pardon of the death sentences of social party members Benna and twenty-some others who participated in the rebellion some months ago. Lerroux submitted the government's general resignation on Friday. (31st Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Madrid President Zamora's decision to order Lerroux to form a new cabinet seems to be an indication of a shift to the left, as the president has given Lerroux a very wide scope, allowing him to recruit left-wingers into the cabinet if necessary. This move will form a new Republican front, but in any case, it cannot occupy a large majority in the parliament, as the Socialist Party will likely adopt a neutral attitude. (30th National Telegram)</p>
<p>Madrid Lerroux, a veteran political figure in Spain and leader of the Radical Party, accepted President Zamora's order today to form a new cabinet. Lerroux has served as prime minister many times and will likely form a coalition cabinet this time, retaining several cabinet members from his party in the previous cabinet.

<h3>Zeppelin Airship's South American Flight Record, Reaches One Million Kilometers of Flight, Twenty-Four Times the Circumference of the Earth, Unimpeded by Any Climate</h3>
<p>National News Agency Berlin Correspondent The "Count Zeppelin" airship made a Christmas flight from South America on December 18 last year, circling through France back to Germany, for a total flight of one million kilometers, and is therefore called the "Millionaire of the Air." There are eighteen people on board, and the ship has been able to fly one million kilometers, which is equal to being a "Millionaire of the Air." This glorious record of one million kilometers of flight cannot be matched by any aircraft or airship in the world today, and is close to twenty-four times the circumference of the Earth. The "Count Zeppelin" has achieved today's satisfactory results after six years of effort, and this achievement has a symbolic meaning in the aviation industry. We believe that the LEIAF airship has also been baptized by the "Count Zeppelin," and the fate of old Count Zeppelin's ingenious ideals is also linked to the fate of his airship. Therefore, we can judge the future of Zeppelin. One million kilometers is Zeppelin's most proud victory of his ideals, and at the same time, this move is also a manifestation of our unyielding will and tireless spirit. Since the "Count Zeppelin" airship reached its flight mission on October 12, 1928, it has been the best evidence of the number of flights required by the First Pacific Airship. According to the statistics of the Hamburg-American Line on airship passengers and shipments, the team has a total of 423 flight routes, with approximately 90 ocean crossings. Each flight takes 8,815 hours, carrying 27,700 passengers, over 5.5 million pieces of mail, and 42,000 kilograms of cargo, all safely.</p>
<p>If we recall the achievements of the Count Zeppelin airship, we can affirm the true meaning of the remarks made by the airship and its crew, under the leadership of the talented Dr. Egen, regarding the pioneering labor. We still remember the first flight to North America in October 1928, and the world's most famous flight in August 1929, and the expedition to the Arctic in July 1931. All of these are deeds of the Zeppelin airship, but unfortunately, they have been forgotten. Furthermore, we still remember the historically valuable event of March 20, 1933, when the German airship was able to create a new record and enter the road to development, opening the South Atlantic route for air traffic between the two continents. Zeppelin's flights have reliable insurance, and the scheduled flight times are accurate, without any errors even by a minute or a second. Regardless of any wind direction, any weather, and all astronomical and climatic difficulties, they have nothing to do with Zeppelin's flights and can still fly as usual. The route from Friedrichshafen to Pernambuco originally took 72 hours, and the time has been shortened through multiple improvements. Because Germany's first Pacific air transport joint venture saves 75% of the time compared to the former, the economic interconnection with North America is of great benefit to Germany's foreign trade.</p>
<p>Our confidence in international airship transportation is gradually growing, and there is a tendency to adapt to the required number of passengers. In 1931, the average number of passengers per flight was four, and in 1933, the average number of passengers increased by 9%. This year broke the previous record. The "Count Zeppelin" airship has more than ten gun positions and the number of flights has increased, but it is still not enough for passengers. Now that the number of passengers is increasing daily, the ticket price can be reduced. In 1929, the ticket price for an ocean-crossing airship was 8,400 German marks. Although it has been reduced to nearly 85%, today it only costs 1,500 marks from Friedrichshafen to Rio de Janeiro.</p>

<h3>Satisfactory Outcome of British-Russian Talks: Eden Departs for Warsaw; Russia Asks Britain to Continue Its Traditional Role in the Far East; Indian Issue Resolved</h3>
<p>(Moscow) British Lord Privy Seal Anthony Eden, who has been here since Thursday discussing the European situation with Soviet Foreign Commissar Maxim Litvinov, etc., is scheduled to depart for Warsaw, the capital of Poland, at 10:45 tonight. He is expected to arrive there at 9:30 tomorrow night. The following day, he will meet with Polish Minister of Military Affairs Marshal Józef Piłsudski and Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Józef Beck. Beck is scheduled to host a banquet for Eden on Tuesday. It is reported that no official welcoming ceremony will be held for Eden during his stay in Warsaw. The public feels that Eden's visit to Russia has yielded good results. During the Berlin talks, when asked about the points mentioned in the Anglo-French communiqué of February 3rd, the German authorities invariably answered with words like "no" or "perhaps." Now, when asked here, Litvinov always answered sincerely with "yes." Eden went to Litvinov's villa, located thirty miles from here, early yesterday morning and only bid farewell to Litvinov in the afternoon. By the time he returned to the British Embassy, it was already five o'clock. Eden then went to the Central Cultural Club, also known as the "General Home of the Red Army." Tonight, the British Embassy will host a banquet, followed by a reception for members of the diplomatic corps, Soviet officials, and foreign journalists. (Reuter, 31st)</p>
<p>(Moscow) Soviet Communist Party Secretary Joseph Stalin and British Lord Privy Seal Anthony Eden held secret talks at the villa of Foreign Commissar Litvinov, located forty kilometers from Moscow. The nature of the talks was extremely important. It is reported that Stalin requested Britain to continue its traditional role in the Far East, namely, to act as a mediator among nations. British officials are very pleased that the Soviet Union did not provoke Britain to oppose Japan and advocated treating it equally. It is rumored that Eden and Litvinov considered the conclusion of a Far Eastern Locarno Treaty by Britain, Japan, and Russia. It is also reported that the Soviet Union had made assurances to Britain regarding the issue of communist propaganda in British territories. This was denied by the Soviet side. However, an agreement on the issue of India between Britain and Russia is likely to be reached. (Havas, 30th)</p>
<p>(Moscow) Stalin met with Eden at Litvinov's villa this afternoon. Soviet officials remain silent about the content and results of their talks, only saying that the situation is still very optimistic and that there is no difference in principle between Britain and the Soviet Union. It is rumored that the Soviet Union has made assurances to Britain regarding the issue of communist propaganda, although the Soviet side has denied it. However, it is only natural that this issue has been discussed. It is generally believed that the mutual relations between Britain and Russia in the areas bordering India have already been discussed. The Soviet Union has given Britain various reassurances. A senior Soviet official even explained that the current situation of communism is no longer comparable to the past, and that the relationship between communism and the world is the same as that of socialism in 1914. (Havas, 30th)</p>
<p>Basic Points: Consensus Reached</p>
<p>(Moscow) The British-Russian talks concluded today. The last meeting was held by Eden and Litvinov at Litvinov's villa. It was Eden's first visit to Russia, so in addition to the talks, he also visited various places. Last night, he went to the theater to watch an opera. When he took his seat, the entire audience cheered loudly and sang the British national anthem. As for the results of the talks between the two countries, it seems that they have completely agreed on the basic points. However, Eden has repeatedly stated to the press that these talks were of an exploratory nature, just like the Berlin talks. Russian sources say that the Soviet government proposed a mutual assistance plan for France, Russia, and Czechoslovakia and asked Britain to maintain "benevolent neutrality." However, there is little hope for the realization of the Eastern European Pact here. (Kuo Min, 30th)</p>
<p>Long-Held Suspicions Now Dispelled</p>
<p>(Moscow) A certain Soviet diplomat responsible for preparations for British Lord Privy Seal Anthony Eden's visit to Moscow told a Havas News Agency representative this morning, "The excellent outcome of Eden's visit to Russia exceeded expectations. The complete success of these British-Russian talks is due to two reasons: first, the results of Eden's visit to Berlin made him understand that the fears of Soviet leaders regarding the serious threat from Germany were not unfounded; second, the situation of the Soviet Union in the Far East has recently greatly eased." An aide to Eden recently told the press, "Britain and Russia have been suspicious of each other for eighteen years. Britain is only now beginning to understand the Soviet Union." However, British sources still say that although the results of Eden's trip are good, the scope is still limited. Eden came to Moscow to gather information, not to negotiate. The conclusions he reached can be ratified by the British cabinet, but they can also be rejected. Everything Eden planned in Moscow will not take effect without the approval of London. Moreover, the rapprochement between Britain and Russia is largely due to "Hitler's committing the most serious diplomatic blunder" (these are the words of Eden's entourage). "He who tied the bell must untie it." If Hitler changes his hard-line attitude in the future, then Britain's conciliatory attitude towards the Soviet Union may also change. (Havas, 31st)</p>
<p>Soviet Minister of Military Affairs States His Views</p>
<p>(Moscow) British Lord Privy Seal Anthony Eden met with Soviet People's Commissar for Military Affairs Kliment Voroshilov at a banquet held at the British Embassy in Russia last night. Voroshilov made some statements to Eden. According to Eden, Hitler told him in Berlin, "Most German cities do not have fortresses and are easily captured. In contrast, the Soviet Union has vast plains that render German shells ineffective. The two cannot be compared on the same day." Voroshilov's statement last night was an indirect response to Hitler's argument, proving that Soviet territory is also vulnerable to German threats. As for Eden and the general British public, they all believe that Soviet military equipment is only for defensive purposes, and the Russian people are deeply peace-loving. This afternoon, Eden will also meet with the French and Italian ambassadors to Russia before flying to Warsaw. (Havas, 31st)</p>
<p>Eden Visits Red Army Headquarters</p>
<p>(Moscow) British Lord Privy Seal Anthony Eden today visited the headquarters of the Red Army's Navy and Army, where he was well received by the respective commanders. He then visited the Red Army's art exhibition. (Kuo Min, 31st)</p>
<p>(Moscow) Eden and his party visited the Western Modern Art Museum yesterday for an hour and a half, and then visited the Central Red Army Museum, inspecting its military room, library, museum, and the painting exhibition of Soviet painter Grekov. (TASS, 31st)</p>
<h3>British Embassy Hosts Reception for Senior Soviet Officials: Eden Says Trip Has Created Good Impression, Sufficient to Initiate Future International Negotiations</h3>
<p>(Moscow) British Lord Privy Seal Anthony Eden held a grand banquet at the British Embassy last night, inviting senior Soviet officials. A reception was held after the banquet. Eden told reporters from this agency at the reception, "We can say that we have completed a good job." The impressions of the British delegation are that the trip yielded very good results. The atmosphere between Britain and the Soviet Union has thus been cleared, and mutual recognition and mutual understanding have naturally progressed as a result. A British representative said, "It is better to deal with Soviet officials in person than to read telegrams sent by the Soviet Union in the Foreign Office in London. There is a big difference." Members of the British delegation remained silent about the content of the British-Soviet talks, but they frankly admitted that the two sides had the same views on various major issues and that there were several other items that needed to be sorted out. However, since the two sides trust and understand each other, the sorting out will be easier to start. Regarding the issue of the Eastern European Mutual Assistance Pact, it is reported that Eden expressed that his country highly sympathizes with this pact and hopes that it will be established even if Germany refuses to join. The Far East issue was also mentioned in the British-Soviet talks, but Soviet officials were unwilling to comment on this. In addition, members of the British delegation said that Stalin had a deep understanding of various diplomatic issues, and Eden greatly admired him, believing that "Stalin is a practical man, just like the British." In short, the British delegation was very satisfied with the Soviet government's courteous treatment and deeply believed that the results of this trip were sufficient to open up future international negotiations. Britain and the Soviet Union are currently jointly drafting a communiqué to summarize the progress. (Havas, 31st)</p>
<h3>Resolving the Japan-Russia Dispute: Russia Discusses Non-Aggression Pact, Welcomes British Mediation, Washington's Attitude is Cold</h3>
<p>(London) As a result of Lord Privy Seal Eden's talks in Moscow, Britain may mediate the dispute between Japan and Russia. Officials say that the Soviet government has good reason to welcome British mediation. Although Japan-Russia negotiations will still be conducted directly, diplomatic circles believe that if a third party mediates, it will be easier to reach an agreement. Soviet Foreign Minister Maxim Litvinov has indicated that the Russian government is willing to discuss with Japan the plan to establish demilitarized zones on the border of "Manchukuo," and the discussion on the conclusion of a non-aggression pact between Japan and Russia based on the principles of the Kellogg-Briand Pact has also been informal. However, it is questionable whether this pact can be concluded without the participation of Britain and the United States. The United States has so far refused to consider this matter, and Secretary of State Cordell Hull has not made a formal statement. (Kuo Min, 31st)</p>
<h3>Tokyo Observes: Russia's Far East Policy Turns Moderate</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Foreign Minister Koki Hirota recently held private talks with Soviet Ambassador to Japan Konstantin Yurenev. Considerable progress has been made regarding the establishment of a foundation for friendly relations between Japan and the Soviet Union. Foreign Minister Hirota is paying close attention to the establishment of a mediation committee for the border disputes between Japan, the Soviet Union, and "Manchukuo." Although the Soviet side has not expressed its approval, it has requested the establishment of a mutual non-aggression treaty and security guarantees of friendship. However, recently, the Soviet Union has been extremely shocked by Germany's rearmament. During the meeting between British special envoy Anthony Eden and Stalin and Litvinov in Moscow, the Soviet leaders all believed that they should first obtain security guarantees in the Far East at this time, and their desire to be realistic is extremely urgent. The so-called non-adoption of a treaty form is also not as rigid as before, and in fact, it has gradually become more moderate. Foreign Minister Hirota's proposed dispute mediation committee is now also expressing careful consideration, and its attitude is quite significant. Therefore, Foreign Minister Hirota's talks with the Soviet Ambassador will have new progress in the Soviet Union's change of foreign policy this time. Therefore, it is of great interest in resolving the pending issues between Japan and the Soviet Union, and it is worthy of attention. (Domei, 31st)</p>
<h3>Sino-Eastern Railway Agreement Documents: Russian Representative Returns to Moscow</h3>
<p>(Harbin) The two Russian representatives who attended the Tokyo Sino-Eastern Railway transfer meeting returned here by plane last night. They will take a train to Moscow tonight. All documents relating to the transfer of the Eastern Railway will be taken to the Russian capital. (Reuter, 31st)</p>
<h3>British Military Authority Discusses Russian Air Force Strength</h3>
<p>(Moscow) A certain senior British official, a well-known military expert of great authority, issued a statement to Havas News Agency yesterday, saying, "The Soviet Union's fortifications on its eastern and western borders are unusually solid and difficult to capture. Even with the current aviation technology of various countries, it is impossible to destroy the Soviet Union's defensive works in a short period of time. The Soviet Union's national defense objectives are currently only two: first, to defend the country to avoid foreign aggression; second, to join collective defense to jointly fight against aggressor countries. The Soviet Union's geographical and military strategic situation is suitable for undertaking the above two tasks. As for aviation, the Russian air force is very well-equipped and can undertake important tasks in the implementation of collective sanctions. Moreover, if war breaks out, the existing aircraft will in fact only be sufficient for superficial and unimportant purposes. Soviet experts have already drawn up complete aircraft designs in their laboratories, such as armored aircraft, stratospheric aircraft, and turbine-type air compressors. If war begins, they will immediately be manufactured according to the drawings to replace the current aircraft, and their combat power will be extremely alarming. The Soviet Union not only has a large number of aircraft and airfields, but also the Soviet Union's industrial organization can rejuvenate the aviation industry in the shortest possible time. For this reason, the Soviet Union's ability to support war must be very great. Germany knows this very well. The reason why Germany is trying to prevent the Eastern European Mutual Assistance Pact from becoming a reality is because it fears that the Soviet Union will join collective sanctions. Now, if the Soviet Union is isolated and does not join the mutual assistance pact, then the Soviet Union itself has the ability to defend itself and may not be controlled by Germany. However, it is a pity that this cannot enable the Soviet Union to assume the main task of guaranteeing European order. Conversely, if the Soviet Union joins the mutual assistance pact, then once an act of aggression occurs, the Soviet military force can quickly be dispatched to punish the aggressor country. Those who intend to commit aggression will naturally be afraid of this and dare not easily start a war." (Havas, 31st)</p>
<h3>Germany Persists in Original Plan: Britain's Illusion Destroyed; Commentary in Moscow Daily</h3>
<p>(Moscow) The French-language Moscow Daily editorial stated that Britain constantly has an illusion that if Hitler is persuaded in a very gentle manner, he will be able to abandon his original plan and be more obedient to the demands of security and peace. But the Berlin talks have undoubtedly destroyed this illusion. When British cabinet members asked Hitler whether he was willing to cooperate with other countries to guarantee peace and promote security for Germany itself and other countries, the answer they received was a firm "no." The result of this talk can be known from this. The newspaper continued, "It is claimed that Hitler, when talking with British cabinet members, detailed the theory that the anti-communist backbone is the historical task of German National Socialism. This point is completely credible. However, we believe that the newspapers of various countries have exaggerated the importance of the Berlin talks and that this kind of激越论调 against the Soviet Union is really that Nazi Germany has the possibility of immediately attacking the Soviet Union. Hitler is willing to accept the anti-Soviet plan and make it part of the entire plan of aggression and territorial expansion. He does not hide in the conversation that he wants to launch in the East to realize his plan to forcibly change the map. However, this is not Hitler's true intention. We should not forget that Hitler cannot claim with the same frankness that he is willing to launch against France, Czechoslovakia, (very likely) or Italian interests first. The sanity of the German authorities has not been confused. They have not forgotten the objective lessons of history, so they are unwilling to invade the vast territory of the Soviet Union to bear the supreme danger. Because the Soviet Union not only has a powerful military force at present, but also has unlimited possibilities to improve and expand its military force. Therefore, in a certain situation, Hitler may be willing to start with other objects of aggression. At the same time, the change of the European map must not start from the East, but must start from the West. We must not forget that there is a part of the people in Nazi Germany, whose power is equal to Hitler's, etc., but not as eloquent as Hitler. They hate France and Poland very much, and what they think is most important is revenge." "As for the Soviet Union, it fully understands the dangers it faces and is ready to strike back head-on. The actions of the leaders of the Soviet government are based on the strength of the Soviet Union. They never妄想 that once something happens, the whole world will be able to help the Soviet Union. At the same time, they do not take the defense of the dangers of Nazi Germany as the center of their European policy, nor do they think that the Soviet border is the most easily invaded area in the whole of Europe. Soviet public opinion considers these issues with a more distant and deeper vision. According to their understanding, German aggression is a bomb in the heart of the whole of Europe. This bomb can explode in any direction. At the same time, real and effective steps must be taken to stop it. Europe is currently facing a difficult problem, that is, it will step up its efforts to establish real security for all countries, as if to allow Germany under Hitler's rule to recklessly carry out its aggressive attempts, or to continue to deepen the unrest of the situation and the threat of war, so that Hitlerism can take the opportunity to complete its preparations for bloodshed unimpeded. There is no other way to solve the problem." (TASS, 31st)</p>
<h3>Britain Should Adopt Policy: Find a Compromise Among Three Options, to be Decided After Eden Returns Home</h3>
<p>(London) Diplomatic circles believe that after Lord Privy Seal Eden returns from Russia and Poland, the British government will exchange views with France and Italy to prepare for the Stresa Conference. The British Cabinet will also hold a meeting at the end of next week to decide its attitude. According to political circles, there are three policies that the government can adopt: (1) A collective security system under the auspices of the League of Nations, in which all countries willing to participate should cooperate; (2) Temporarily focus on the Western European Air Pact and the Arms Limitation Pact. As for the Eastern European Mutual Assistance Pact and the Danube River Pact, they should be established when the situation is more favorable. This policy is advocated by the recent editorial of The Times; (3) A wait-and-see policy. It is generally believed that the British government should find a compromise solution among these.

<p>Press Opinions Divided into Two Factions</p>
<p>(London) Regarding the European situation, the British press has recently been divided into two factions with different opinions. One is represented by Robert Corfe, editor-in-chief of The Observer, and the other is represented by "Investigator" (pseudonym of the author) of The Sunday Times. Corfe believes that there are large differences in opinion between Britain and Germany. Britain should now cooperate with all peace-loving countries so that the collective security system can be completed. "Investigator" said, "Britain should not support any party. If our country wants to preserve the position of mediator, it must maintain the freedom of all actions. This is the only condition for our country to serve the public." (Havas, 31st)</p>
<h3>Diplomatic Blunder: Germany Apologizes to Britain; German Embassy in Britain Statement: British Government Considers it an Insult</h3>
<p>(London) Germany today formally apologized to the British government for a diplomatic blunder. The cause of the matter was that Foreign Secretary Sir John Simon reported to the Cabinet on his recent talks with German Führer Adolf Hitler in Berlin. A certain British radio station broadcast news that the Foreign Secretary deeply felt that the German Air Force, even if not superior to Britain, was equal to Britain. The German Embassy then rashly issued a statement saying that Simon had said that Hitler had said that the German Air Force, even if not superior to Britain, was equal to Britain, which was not true. Simon was reportedly quite angry when he heard this and immediately sent a telegram to the British Ambassador to Germany, Sir Eric Phipps, ordering him to protest to the German Foreign Office. German Foreign Minister Konstantin von Neurath also immediately sent a telegram ordering the German Embassy in London's Chargé d'affaires, Prince Bismarck, to formally apologize to the British Foreign Office. Diplomatic circles said that this matter was quite different. Simon's usual position was that even if France opposed it, Germany must be given the opportunity to show its good faith. If he believed that the German Embassy's statement was an insult to the British government, then Britain might turn around and support the abandonment of Germany's conclusion of a mutual assistance pact by Russia and France. As for what Simon's original report to the Cabinet was, it has not been announced. However, according to The Observer, it must have mentioned the powerful air force that Germany was building up, while the Cabinet has always believed that Britain's air force is 40% better than Germany's.

<h3>Little Entente to Conclude Mutual Assistance Pact</h3>

<h3>Germany Retaliates Against Lithuania: Refuses to Sign Transit Visas, Lithuanians Must Go by Sea to Western Europe</h3>
<p>Kaunas: The German authorities have taken retaliatory steps because the Lithuanian authorities sentenced several National Socialist Party members accused of subverting the state to severe penalties. Yesterday, the German Consul stationed here refused to issue passports to Lithuanians passing through German territory. Lithuania has no diplomatic relations with Poland, so Lithuanians who want to go to Western Europe must now reach there by sea. Germany is extremely indignant at Lithuania's heavy punishment of the National Socialist Party members. Of the 126 defendants, only 34 were acquitted. Four were sentenced to death, two to life imprisonment, nine to nine years imprisonment, two to eight years imprisonment, and the rest were sentenced to imprisonment ranging from one to seven years.

<h3>British Finances: Surplus, Not Deficit</h3>
<p>(London) According to a Ministry of Finance report, after offsetting revenue and expenditure for the fiscal year ending last night, there remains a surplus of £7,652,000. The total revenue for the year was £716,441,000, exceeding the budget by approximately £10,000,000. Expenditure totaled £708,879,000, exceeding the budgeted figure by £3,155,000. Income tax alone amounted to £229,000,000 by last night, exceeding the budget by £9,000,000. Additional taxes and property tax revenues were also higher than expected. Customs duties totaled £290,000,000, exactly as projected. Expenditure included £12,343,000 for debt repayment through the Sinking Fund. Therefore, excluding debt repayment, revenue exceeded expenditure by approximately £20,000,000. Short-term debt currently totals £833,380,000, compared to £844,710,000 at the same time last year.

<h3>Illegal Sale and Purchase of the Sino-Soviet Railway by Japan and Russia: Important Towns on the Mid-Eastern Line Completely Control Enormous Military and Economic Authority. Each Town Produces Abundant Goods and Has Beautiful Scenery.</h3>
<p>Harbin Correspondence: The Sino-Soviet Railway illegal sale and purchase event, which has attracted worldwide attention, was completed with the signing ceremony on March 23rd. From then on, the Eastern Line belonged to Japan. The true owner who seized the line is Japan. Its intention is to exert its military power in transportation and control the entire Northeast in order to complete a part of Japan's domination of the Far East. From this, we can know the importance of the line. No wonder the Japanese do not hesitate to spend huge sums to urgently purchase it. The important towns along the Eastern Line, their military positions, and their production and scenery are described as follows:</p>
<p>Binzhou Line</p>
<p>Manzhouli is located 580 miles west of Harbin, at the northwestern tip of the Northeast. It borders Russia, Outer Mongolia, and Manchukuo. It is a protruding town like a tumor. In the past, when the Qing Dynasty built the Chinese Eastern Railway, it was the terminus of the Trans-Baikal Railway and the starting station of the Chinese Eastern Railway. After the Russo-Japanese War, according to the Sino-Japanese Manchuria Treaty, it was opened to foreign residents and trade at the same time as Hailar. The current population is about 6,500, including 350 Japanese, 3,000 Russians (half Red and half White), and 3,000 Chinese. Near the 86th station on the line stands a gate. This gate is a memorial to the Chinese army repelling the Russian army after the Sino-Russian conflict, named the Counterattack Gate. The streets are quiet. During the conflict, the remains of houses destroyed by Russian aircraft bombs still exist, giving one a feeling of ruins.</p>
<p>Zalantun is the location of the famous Zalantun Coal Mine on the Eastern Line. The mining area is divided into five areas. The annual coal production is about 10 million tons. The quality is not very good. Coal mining was suspended during the Sino-Russian conflict. After the establishment of Manchukuo, it continued to operate.</p>
<p>Hailar is the ancient political center of Hulunbuir and a thriving commercial town. It is a basin-shaped central town surrounded by sandy hills on the right bank of the Hailar River tributary. The population is about 11,000. Since the establishment of Manchukuo, Hailar has been the political and administrative center of Xing'an Province and shows a trend of development. The Ganzhuur Temple, 300 li south of Hailar, has a large Mongolian fair every year from the first to the fifteenth day of the eighth month of the lunar calendar.</p>
<p>Xing'an is the rooftop of Manchukuo, the junction of the Greater and Lesser Khingan Mountains, with deep birch forests. Even summer nights are chilly. Located on high ground, it is a famous resort and sanatorium. There is a route-type railway here. When Su Bingwen rose up to resist Japan and quell the puppet regime, Japanese army engineer Captain Araki was shot and killed in front of the Xing'an Tunnel.</p>
<p>From Niuzishan to Genghis Khan, the area is a hilly grassland with beautiful birch trees everywhere, close to the famous Genghis Khan Fortress.</p>
<p>Fularji borders the Nen River and faces Ang'angxi. It is a relatively important city on the Binzhou Line and a place of special products. It exports 50,000 tons of soybeans and soybean cakes each year. The Nen River fishery is also very prosperous. During the Russo-Japanese War, six Japanese martyrs, Hengchuan Shengzan and Zhongzhenjie, infiltrated from Beijing with multiple difficulties, attempting to destroy the Nen River Railway Bridge. They were discovered by the Russian army and arrested Hengchuan and Zhongzhen at this place.</p>
<p>Anda is the granary of northern Manchuria and a major distribution center for agricultural products. Within a year, about 500,000 dan of soybeans, 200,000 dan of wheat, 30,000 dan of millet, 20,000 dan of barley, and 20,000 dan of sorghum are sent from the station. The aggregate quantity is very significant. During harvest time, merchants from Britain, Russia, and other countries establish branch offices here. The soybeans in the open-air stacking yard are piled up like mountains, which is quite spectacular.</p>
<p>Binsui Line</p>
<p>Suifenhe is the only gateway between the Soviet Maritime Province and our Northeast, facing the old Soviet trading center of Groot. It is the terminal station of the Eastern Line. The town is on a mountain slope and has a Russian style. The populations of Chinese and Russians are about the same. Including the Japanese and Koreans, the population is about 9,000.</p>
<p>Mudanjiang, a tributary of the Songhua River, borders the Mudan River and is close to the fertile fields of Ning'an. Relying on water transportation, it is a distribution center for agricultural products. The city is convenient for transportation by water and railway. Its future development is promising. The Ahe shelter station, about seven kilometers west of Mudanjiang, has the Chinese Eastern Railway Agricultural Experimental Station and is a scenic spot with the Mudanjiang and Ahe rivers.</p>
<p>Hengdaohezi is located in the middle of the Binsui Line. In the past, it was only a cold village. When Russia built the Eastern Railway, it regarded it as an important military location and established a large parking lot. Since its establishment, it has developed rapidly. The population is about 10,000. Nearby areas produce a large amount of timber, and agricultural products such as honey are also quite abundant. The so-called Arashiyama of northern Manchuria refers to this place. From this point of view, it is truly a scenic line in northern Manchuria. It is also one of the most important cities on the Binsui Line, with a population of about 15,000. The city is more beautiful than other cities, and the commerce is also very prosperous. The Ant River near the city is suitable for swimming and fishing in the summer. Many Russians from Harbin go there every year to escape the summer heat. It is also an agricultural distribution center, with famous products such as mountain wine, honey, and berry wine.</p>
<p>Ercengdianzi is surrounded by mountains. It is the only hot spring and hunting ground in Binsui County. The middle class of Harbin often take hunting dogs to the area. In the summer, many people from Harbin go there to escape the summer heat, and there are villas rented specifically for vacationers.</p>
<p>Five li south of the Ashe River Station is the city of Acheng. This place has lost its development because it is too close to Harbin. In the past, it was also a connecting point between northern and southern Manchuria, and a place with considerable development. Five li south of Acheng is the ruins of the Tucheng of Baicheng. This is the capital of the Jin Dynasty, Huining Prefecture, a historically famous place.</p>
<p>"Jing"Bin Line</p>
<p>Kuanchengzi, the terminal station of the southern line, is a branch line three kilometers from the "Xinjing" station and connected to the South Manchuria Railway. The city is located northwest of "Xinjing" and has a population of about 3,000. It has the flavor of a Russian rural town. There is a telegraph company and Kuanchengzi post office. Zhang has a tall radio broadcasting line. Because it is adjacent to "Xinjing," the Japanese population has greatly increased.</p>
<p>Yaomen has been a rapidly developing city since the construction of the Eastern Railway. It is an important collection point for grain along the line. The station transports about 270,000 dan of soybeans, 200,000 dan of sorghum, and 50,000 dan of other grains each year. Poultry breeding is also very prosperous. The population is about 10,000.</p>
<p>Songhuajiang borders the right bank of the Second Songhua River. The bridge is 2,400 feet long and is the second longest bridge on the Eastern Line. Water transportation is convenient. Grain is transported by sailing boats from the lower reaches of Botuna.</p>
<p>Sanchahe ranks first in the amount of grain sent on the "Jing"Bin Line, reaching 13 million poods per year, ranking fourth after Binzhou, Binsui County, Harbin, Anda, and Mangou. The population is 35,000, and commerce is prosperous.</p>
<p>Shuangchengpu is located 24 miles south of Harbin and is an important city along the Jingbin Line. This place has always been the official post office, and like Ashehe Botu, it has been a capital city of northern Manchuria since ancient times. By the end of the Qing Dynasty, as a result of encouraging immigration to "Manchuria," the population increased, especially since the construction of the Eastern Railway, the accumulation of materials has increased daily. The amount of goods sent is second to none among the three lines. The city is located one mile south of the station, with a population of over 50,000. (Northeast News Agency)</p>
<h3>War Zone Issues: Negotiations Between Both Sides in Tianjin; Cleansing Committee Convenes to Discuss Three Matters; Two Commissioners Will Concurrently Serve as Security Commanders; Yin Tong Will Come South to Meet Wang Jingwei and Huang Fu</h3>
<p>Beiping Correspondence: The Cleansing Committee met in full committee on the previous (28th) and yesterday (29th) to address the unfinished "War Zone" issue and held discussions. This morning (30th) an interim meeting was continued. Only Yin Tong, Yin Rugeng, and Tao Shangming attended. The meeting adjourned at about noon. The various situations as obtained by inquiry are recorded below:</p>
<p>Conference Contents</p>
<p>The content of the meeting concerns roughly three issues: (1) the thorough rectification of illegal civil corps in the "War Zone"; (2) the date of departure of the newly formed security force; (3) the unification of the powers of the commissioners in the Jixuan and Yuyu areas. Regarding the first item, the Jixuan area will begin after the completion of the troop deployment of Feng Shoupeng and other units of the Yu County Security Force, although the resistance of Wang Chengzhu's troops at Ya Hongqiao is not a serious concern. Up to recently, the rebellious troops are about to be put down in order, and reorganization can be started soon. The Aoyuyu area will continue to be reorganized after the completion of the reorganization of the Jixuan area civil corps. The second item, the date of departure of the newly formed security force, has not yet been determined because Yu Xuezhong, Chairman of Hebei Province, is visiting relatives in his hometown of Penglai and has not yet returned to Tianjin. It has been decided that it will be determined after Yu returns to Tianjin. It is necessary to negotiate with the Japanese. As for the unification of the powers of the commissioners of the two areas, the parties concerned are still trying to avoid talking about it until the facts are concrete.</p>
<p>Continued Discussions in Tianjin</p>
<p>The above three matters all require contact with the Japanese. Therefore, it has been decided to negotiate in Tianjin. Iga Seiya, head of the Japanese Yuyu Special Service Agency, left for Tianjin from Beiping on the previous (28th) and has remained in Tianjin, preparing to meet our representatives. Takahashi Hiroshi, a military attache at the Japanese Embassy in Beiping, also left for Tianjin at 8:45 this morning (30th). Tao Shangming, Commissioner of the Aoyuyu area, left Beiping this evening (30th) at 8:15. Yin Tong, Director of the Beining Railway Bureau, has also decided to leave Beiping tomorrow (21st). It is heard that the conference will be held on the day after tomorrow (1st) at the latest. At that time, in addition to discussing the above three matters, the issue of the receiving of the Eastern Mausoleums may be discussed on the side.</p>
<p>Security Issues</p>
<p>Since the establishment of the commissioners' offices in the Jixuan and Yuyu areas two years ago, the powers of the commissioners have been limited to administrative supervision. In the event of bandit alarms, command has always been ineffective in suppressing them. Therefore, some people advocate increasing the powers of the commissioners, and some people suggest setting up a security commander to take responsibility. Since the matter concerns the administrative system of the provincial government, all parties believe that thorough discussion is necessary. This issue has been brewing until now and is likely to be realized in a concrete way. In general, it is following the precedent of administrative supervisors and commissioners in bandit areas, with the commissioners of the two areas concurrently serving as security commanders. The authorities are now considering this and are expected to approve it. If this proposal is successful, the security forces and civil corps in the "War Zone," in addition to the original command system remaining the same, the "War Zone" security commander will have the power to dispatch at any time. With this approach, the banditry in the "War Zone" can be expected to be suppressed.</p>
<p>Yin Tong Goes South</p>
<p>According to unofficial sources, Yin Tong, Director of the Beining Railway Bureau, will go to Nanjing from Tianjin in the short term. In addition to reporting to the Ministry of Railways on the affairs of the bureau, he will also call on Director Wang to present a statement on the recent situation in North China. Yin will stay in Nanjing for about three days and then travel to Hangzhou via the Beijing-Hangzhou Highway to call on Huang Fu at Mogan Mountain and report everything. As for his itinerary after arriving in Shanghai, there is no definite information at this time. (30th)</p>
<h3>Huang Commission Sends Personnel to Shandong to Oversee Repairs to the Golden Dike: Plugging the Guantai Breach Extremely Difficult; Yellow River at Risk of Changing Course; On-Site Inspection of the Breach Mouth</h3>
<p>Jinan Dispatch: The Guantai project is becoming increasingly perilous. Over 80% of the water is leaking through the breach mouth, almost completely diverting the main river flow. According to the first section report from the Shandong Provincial River Affairs Bureau, the water volume in the main river is decreasing daily. Although there is still 20% of the water downstream from Guantai, it becomes a mere trickle by the time it reaches Shandong Province. Near Li Sheng Village, the riverbed is almost completely dry, and the riverbed is fully exposed. The situation suggests a change of course is imminent. Simultaneously, the water level within the Golden Dike is vast, with turbulent waves rushing towards Taochengbu, rejoining the main river. This section of the Golden Dike is quite low and thin. The Fan County section has the river flowing straight with no bay area, and the flow is mainly in the center, so there is probably no danger. East of Fan County, the main flow is approaching the dike root. If the Guantai breach is not plugged, and a major flood occurs, the water level will rise sharply, scouring the dike root. The Golden Dike has no diversion dams to resist, and danger is feared to be unavoidable. Guarding the Guancheng and Taochengbu area is the most important. The Shouzhang County seat is close to the Golden Dike and has a protective city wall dike. If the Golden Dike has an accident, the Shouzhang County seat will certainly be submerged, the consequences of which are too horrible to contemplate. Therefore, it is most important to reinforce the Golden Dike before this major flood. The Yellow River Conservancy Commission has been ordered to take responsibility for reinforcing the Golden Dike in Hebei, Shandong, and Henan provinces. It has convened a meeting of the heads of the river affairs bureaus of the three provinces in Kaifeng to discuss the construction methods. It has now been decided to divide the work into two sections: from Hua County to Gaodigou, Zhao Shenlu has been appointed as the section chief; from Gaodigou to Taochengbu, Wang Zongkui has been appointed as the section chief. A telegram has also been sent to the Shandong Provincial Government ordering the counties along the Golden Dike within the province—Dong'a, Shouzhang, Yanggu, Chaocheng, Guancheng, Fan County, and Pu County—to fully cooperate to ensure work starts on time. The provincial government has immediately sent telegrams to the various counties to comply and has instructed the River Affairs Bureau to take note. According to people in the river works sector, if the Guantai breach cannot be plugged, the Yellow River will inevitably change its course and follow the Golden Dike. The losses of people and property within the Golden Dike can be compensated by taking from the dried-up reclaimed land. However, the government's finances are stretched, and the sudden northward shift of the Yellow River will make future flood prevention work even more difficult. On the south bank of the main river, the cost of sorting out diversion dams over the years has been approximately several million dollars. Once the Yellow River shifts north, it will be all for nothing. The Golden Dike has always been low and thin. To make it a formal major dike, it is necessary to add and repair diversion dams, costing several million dollars. With the government's current strength, raising this huge amount of money may be difficult. If it cannot be properly repaired, the lives and property of the people on the north bank of the Yellow River will have no protection at all. This is truly worrying. Continued dispatch: Since the Yellow River breached at Guantai, the counties in western Shandong have suffered severe disasters. Shouzhang County, being located downstream, is particularly affected. On the 18th of this month, after the disaster victims in Shouzhang County established the Committee to Petition for Repairing and Plugging the Changyuan Breach, they have been actively working to request the plugging of the breach. In addition to sending telegrams to the central government requesting prompt allocation of funds for repair and plugging, they have also sent representatives from the county, Yue Chongjue, to Fan County, Pu County, and Changyuan County in Hebei Province to coordinate appeals and to conduct an on-site inspection of the Guantai breach mouth. The reporter also went along. On the 20th of this month, at 7:00 AM, we departed from Shouzhang and arrived in Fan County at 11:00 AM that day. Unfortunately, County Magistrate Zhang had left to inspect the Golden Dike, so we did not meet. We then agreed with the Fan County representative, Zhuo Shengwu, to travel west together. At 5:00 PM, we arrived in Pu County and visited County Magistrate Xu Shusheng and leaders of various agencies, all of whom said that if the Guantai breach mouth is not quickly plugged, the disaster in western Shandong will continue to worsen. That evening, we stayed in Pu County. The next day (21st), we traveled west again. On the 23rd, we arrived at the Guantai breach mouth. Because the area is at the junction of Hebei and Shandong provinces, the area is not peaceful, and bandits often appear, so the journey was delayed. After arriving at Guantai, we stayed at the office of the Yellow River Conservancy Commission in Xinzhuang. We were received by the staff. Chief Kong Xiangrong had returned to Kaifeng to withdraw funds, and the Director of the Hebei River Affairs Bureau, Qi Shou'an, had returned to Puyang, so we did not meet them. Later, we met with Sang Xinzhi, inspector of the Work Relief Group of the Yellow River Conservancy Commission, and Section Chief Zhu Chang'an. According to them, when the work was estimated at the Guantai breach mouth in August of the 23rd year of the Republic, the river channel was over 20 zhang wide and 3-4 chi deep. By the Lunar New Year, the deepest point was no more than 6 chi. Construction started on the 19th day of the first lunar month this year. From last year to the present, over 10 million stakes, tens of thousands of hemp, and over 200,000 bricks and stones have been used. The total expenditure on sacks, straw bags, and earth materials is 420,000 dollars. Currently, the upper opening of the breach mouth is 6.6 zhang wide, the lower opening is 7.5 zhang wide, and both are 10 zhang deep. 80% of the water is flowing through. The main flow is scouring the main dam and side dams at the breach mouth, but the dam bodies and side dams, which are protected by stone-filled cages, are solid. The back of the embankment on both sides has been eroded by the main flow. An additional 40 zhang of facing has been added to the east dam, with a width of over 3 zhang. The construction departments and River Affairs Bureaus of the three provinces have jointly estimated that two spur dikes should be built at the breach mouth, with an estimated cost of 200,000 dollars. A brushwood dam is estimated to cost 200,000 dollars. The Taikang Dike (i.e., the Linhuang Dike) is estimated to cost 200,000 dollars. The Huaqing Dike North (built by the China International Famine Relief Commission) is estimated to cost 50,000 dollars, totaling 650,000 dollars. Chief Kong has now received 200,000 dollars, and work can start within three to five days. Currently, the project at the breach mouth is still suspended, but protection work is still actively underway. There are over 540 river soldiers, 220 boatmen, over 30 boats, and 310 laborers. To repair the stone-filled basket dams, the coastal counties of Shandong Province have been ordered by Chairman Han via telegram to contribute ships to transport materials, which are now arriving one after another. If the central government can promptly allocate funds and start construction within the specified time, there is still hope of closing the breach before the summer flood season. If the delay continues, the consequences will be unimaginable. The reporter returned east on the 25th, arrived in Pu County on the 26th, and passed through Fan County to Shouzhang on the 27th. I saw the river water rising rapidly outside the Golden Dike, and the disaster situation is getting worse. If the Changyuan breach is not closed quickly, the disaster victims in western Shandong will be truly unimaginable. (29th)</p>
<h3>Songjiang: Fire Brigade Members Continue Mass Resignation</h3>
<p>Li Ruizhi and Yao Chongshi, fire brigade members of this county, were test-driving the fire engine last year when they encountered the demolition of the Songhui Amusement Park. The park owner, Yin Shisheng, filed a lawsuit according to the law, which was transferred to the Shanghai District Court for trial. After the debate concluded, bail was granted pending judgment. All members of the brigade were unanimously indignant and initiated a mass resignation, also organizing the "Support Association for Comrades Li and Yao Who Were Wrongfully Accused." Subsequently, the County Chamber of Commerce, citing the importance of local fire protection while the city river is being dredged, sent a letter requesting the fire brigade members to resume their duties. Furthermore, Wang Zhewu, a standing committee member of the Party Branch, and County Magistrate Jin Tigan, among others, attended to persuade and comfort, and they agreed to maintain their positions until the end of this month. The Shanghai court is scheduled to pronounce judgment on the 30th. At the beginning of the resignation, the members' copper helmets and uniforms were all handed over to the Federation. During the maintenance period, temporary certificates were issued for identification. Yesterday, the court sentenced the two members, Li and Yao, to one year of imprisonment each, suspended for three years. The private prosecution part was transferred to the civil court for trial. When the news arrived, the brigade members were even more indignant that Li and Yao were unjustly wronged. Representatives from the fire brigades of Districts 1, 2, 3, and 4 gathered at the Federation to hold an emergency meeting. It was resolved that they would unanimously continue the mass resignation, handing over the temporary certificates and all fire-fighting equipment to the Federation to indicate that they would no longer be responsible for any fire protection matters from the 30th. For a time, the pumps and Western-style dragons gathered, totaling eighteen. They also distributed a declaration to all sectors, stating roughly: "Regarding the case of our comrades Li and Yao being falsely accused by Yin Shisheng, this association previously issued a declaration announcing a mass resignation. Subsequently, after sincere persuasion from the Party and government organs, we reluctantly agreed to maintain our positions until the 30th of this month. Now, the Shanghai District Court has actually sentenced the two comrades, and all of us are deeply indignant. Fire brigade members, with a spirit of sacrifice, serve the public. Now, the two comrades are falsely accused for serving in fire protection, and instead of obtaining justice, they are wronged. The injustice suffered by the two comrades is a threat to every member. Therefore, it has been resolved that, in addition to handing over the temporary certificates and all fire-fighting equipment to the Federation, we will not be responsible for fire protection matters from March 31st. We hereby declare this for public knowledge."</p>
<h3>New Appointed Police Chief Arrives at Songjiang</h3>
<p>The appointment of the Police Chief for this county, which was resolved in the provincial government meeting, is that He Runzhang, Police Chief of Huaiyin County, will be transferred to Songjiang. After receiving the commission, He first sent the Chief of the General Affairs Section, Yang Shaozhen, and the Chief of the First Branch Bureau, Ma Kaifan, who arrived in Songjiang last night. He himself has also arrived in Songjiang and is scheduled to take office on April 1st.</p>
<h3>Wuxi: The Bail Issue of the Gu Tongshen Case</h3>
<p>Yi Yu, the County Magistrate, and Zhong Jingcheng, because of the case of the former Land Tax Director Gu Tongshen and others of the county absconding after embezzlement, detained Shao, the wife of Chu Kaiyao, the judicial secretary of the county, for interrogation and also detained Gu Tianmin, who had previously acted as guarantor for Gu and others, and demanded a payment of 5,000 silver dollars, leading to accusations that were tried by the local branch court of this county. This has already been reported in this newspaper. Now, the original text of the bail bond of Gu Tianmin and others guaranteeing Gu Tongshen is recorded below: "The firms Xinyangxian, etc., submit a bail bond to the County Magistrate. We hereby guarantee that the former Tax Collection Director, Gu Tongshen, who handled the collection of taxes and land prices for various years of busy canal transport, will, in accordance with the order, follow the procedures for clearing up accounts and will not shirk responsibility or leave without authorization. Before the final settlement is completed, we guarantee that he will be available whenever summoned and will not evade. If there is any evasion, all outstanding amounts cleared will be jointly compensated by the firms. This is a true bail bond."</p>
<h3>Developing Postal Services in Jiangsu-Anhui Region</h3>
<p>Tu Jiahua, the Director of Postal Services for the Jiangsu-Anhui Region, in order to promote the development of postal services, in addition to reorganizing the existing post offices in various counties of Jiangsu and Anhui, is also establishing branch offices in various locations. Recently, Shen Fengzheng, the Director of the Wuxi First-Class Post Office, received an order from the region instructing him to plan for the establishment of three third-class post offices in Huashu and Changjing in Jiangyin County, and Xueyanqiao, which is at the junction of Wuxi and Changzhou. After receiving the order, Director Shen has dispatched Wang Chongsheng and Quan Changsheng to Huashu and Changjing to make preparations. Qian Songnian has been sent to Xueyanqiao to make preparations. Wang and Quan are scheduled to go to Cheng this week to investigate and select sites. In Caoqiao, Yixing County, the region also plans to establish a third-class post office, which will soon be realized. The Wuxi First-Class Post Office, due to the developed postal services in Wuxi, in addition to setting up four branches in the east, south, west, and north, has also established postal agency offices at Futaiyuan on Malu Road, Xuehaitang on Beidajie, and other locations. Regulations have also been established regarding the sending of parcels by the people, such as "lightweight parcels" that can be placed in mailboxes, with a postage of 2 jiao for each parcel. However, if the weight exceeds 100 centimeters, an additional 5 fen of postage is required, up to a limit of 1,000 centimeters. Those exceeding this regulation must be handed over to the parcel room for delivery. Five new-style mailboxes were replaced in the Xinsheng Road area of the city last month, making it more convenient for nearby people to send mail.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou: Tang Dynasty Tomb Discovered in Situ Temple</h3>
<p>Xue Zaitian, a farmer in Situ Temple in the western countryside of the county, has a field located at the east end of Xiaoxingtang. Next to his field is a stone tomb of the Hong family from the Tang Dynasty. Because no one had taken care of it for many years, Xue invited his clansman Xue Wanming and others to excavate the tomb and discovered many ancient objects stored in the tomb passage. It is reported that the coffin has now been sent to Liu Chunxiang, the mayor of the town, for safekeeping.</p>
<h3>Gaoyou: Fire at Xu Family Village Burns a Child to Death</h3>
<p>Last night (the 28th), in the home of Yao Weixian, a farmer in the Xu Family Village area of the third district of this county, a fire was started when he struck a match to light a paper cigarette and left the fire on the grass. He did not notice it at the time. After a while, the fire broke out and immediately spread to the thatched hut. Yao quickly got up to extinguish it, but to no avail. His wife was also startled and ran out to call for help, but it was late at night, and no one came to the rescue. In an instant, the fire illuminated the sky and also affected the Xu family next door, burning for an hour. More than ten rooms in both families and all their belongings were reduced to ashes. Yao's four-year-old boy was unable to be rescued and died in the fire. The loss is estimated at about a thousand dollars.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou: Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway Business Increases Sharply</h3>
<p>Recently, with the approach of the spring holiday, there has been a sudden increase in tourists coming to Hangzhou on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway, especially school groups. Each express train has more than a thousand passengers. Although most tickets are round-trip tickets purchased in Shanghai, the income of the Hangzhou station is also around five or six thousand dollars per day. Yesterday, the 31st, due to the excessive number of passengers and luggage, the early express train was delayed by about an hour upon arrival. The business of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway has also increased similarly, with a large number of spring tourists. Special excursion buses to Tianmu Mountain and Yan Ziling have been opened to facilitate tourism.</p>

<p>Publication of Land Requisition</p>
<p>The municipal government also issued a notice saying, "This city is a major port for trade, with numerous factories and a large population. The general public often builds thatched huts in the suburbs as places to live, which are crowded together everywhere. There is no sanitation or fire protection equipment, making it difficult to avoid the occurrence of infectious diseases and disasters. In order to relieve the people's livelihood, this government has built hundreds of rooms in common people's residences in the Nanshi and Zhabei areas, which are rented out at low prices, in order to improve the poor environment of the common people. Recently, due to the decline of rural areas, more and more people from all over are coming to Shanghai to seek a living, and the number of shantytowns has become even greater. This not only hinders the appearance of the city but is also related to international impressions. Therefore, this government has decided to temporarily requisition dozens of mu of land in Tanzhiwan and near the American Road where there are shantytowns to build two more common people's residences for the general poor to rent. In addition to ordering the relevant bureaus to erect signs within the scope of requisition, handle matters according to the law, and start construction, we will also investigate the demolition of houses, relocation of graves, and agricultural products, and pay compensation in accordance with the usual practice. Apart from requesting approval from the relevant ministry, a map is attached for public notice in advance. All those who own land listed on the map must stop transferring ownership from today to facilitate the process. This is to notify all property owners in the area. Mayor Wu Tiecheng, March 27, 24th year of the Republic of China."</p>
<h3>Chen Gongbo Discusses Developing Industry</h3>
<p>Minister of Industry Chen Gongbo, who came to Shanghai the day before yesterday to preside over the opening ceremony of the China Alcohol Factory, told a reporter from the Central News Agency that the Ministry of Industry is determined to develop the various industries of our country, adhering to the spirit of "talking less and doing more," and will proceed step by step. He especially hopes that all sectors will work hard to create and cooperate with the government. He will return to Beijing around today or tomorrow (i.e., yesterday and today).</p>
<h3>Sun Ke and Others Went to Beijing Yesterday</h3>
<p>Sun Ke, Ma Chaojun, and Zeng Zhongming went to Beijing yesterday on the night express train.</p>
<h3>Polish School Ship Hosted Press Tour Yesterday Afternoon; Polish Embassy Held a Tea Party in the Evening to Thank All Sectors; Scheduled to Leave Shanghai Southbound for Hong Kong This Morning</h3>
<p>The Polish Commercial Training School Ship Dar Pomorza, which is circumnavigating the world and visiting China, has been warmly welcomed by all sectors of our country. Yesterday, the ship's owner hosted a tour for Chinese and foreign reporters on board, and the Polish Embassy held a grand tea party in the evening to bid farewell. It is scheduled to leave Shanghai southbound for Hong Kong at 10:30 AM today to continue its voyage. The details of each situation are recorded separately as follows:</p>
<p>Hosting Reporters: At 3:00 PM yesterday, the ship's owner, Mr. Maziejewski, hosted a tour for Chinese and foreign reporters on board, and specially prepared Polish tea and snacks. More than 20 Chinese and foreign reporters accepted the invitation and went to visit. They were guided by Mr. Huasel, the counselor of the Polish Embassy, from the Customs Pier on the Bund at 2:50 PM and boarded the Dar Pomorza on a gasoline ferry. The ship's owner, Mr. Maziejewski, personally greeted them, accompanied by the Polish Consul General in Shanghai, Guo Jiaxin Skirsky. The ship's professor led them to visit various parts of the ship. Then, they enjoyed tea and snacks in the shipowner's room. Finally, the shipowner and the Chinese reporters took a group photo. They left at about 5:00 PM. Students dispatched by the ship sent the reporters to the Xin Guan Pier on a gasoline ferry.</p>
<p>Perfect Equipment: The ship's hull and masts are all made of iron, so its appearance is roughly the same as an ordinary ship. However, its speed depends entirely on the power of the sails, so it is not as fast as a steamship. The upper part of the bow is for raising and lowering the anchor. The method usually uses manpower, but sometimes mechanical power is also used. The lower deck is the food storage room and the bathroom and toilet. The middle part of the ship has only the lower deck and no upper deck. Inside are a number of small rooms, which are the rest areas for the officers of the ship. On the right side are two large rooms, one is a music room and classroom, and the other is a machinery room. The machinery is specially prepared to supplement when it is impossible to use sails or when there are other difficulties, so the engine horsepower is very small, only 560 horsepower, using gasoline as fuel. The upper deck at the rear of the ship is the radio and astronomical instrument room, etc. The lower deck is the captain's room and living room, which are well arranged. When the ship's professor guided the reporters to visit, he gave a detailed explanation of each part. It is said that when the weather is good and there are no waves, the ship can sail at four or five miles per hour by sail. When the wind is strong, it can only sail at a variable ten or so miles, so it took 42 days to travel from Honolulu to Yokohama, Japan.</p>
<p>Polish Envoy's Farewell: The Polish Ambassador to China, Weideng Tao, as the ship is scheduled to leave Shanghai today, specially hosted a banquet at the Polish ambassador's residence on Baojian Road at 7:30 last night to bid farewell to the ship's owner, Maziejewski, and Professor Lojuski. Mayor Wu, the Vice Minister of the Navy, and Polish Consul Guo Lai Xinski were also present. The guests and hosts enjoyed themselves until 9:00 PM.</p>
<p>Grand Tea Party: At 10:15 PM last night, Polish Ambassador Weideng Tao and his wife held a grand tea party at the ambassador's residence on Baojian Road to thank all sectors for their hospitality. Over a hundred people attended, including Vice Minister of the Navy Chen Jiliang, Mayor Wu's representative Tang Shixuan, Director of the Diplomatic Affairs Office Yu Ming, Section Chief Zhao Tiezhang, Director of the General Affairs Department of the Ministry of Finance Xu Jianping and his wife, Japanese Ambassador Ariyoshi Akira and his wife, the Soviet Russian Charge d'Affaires, the Consuls General of Japan, France, England, and Germany, representatives of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, and Chinese and foreign journalists. The Polish Ambassador and his wife, Dr. Guo Lai Xinski, the Polish Consul General, and the ship's owner and officers warmly greeted the guests with champagne, accompanied by music and dancing. The guests and hosts enjoyed themselves until about 1:00 AM.</p>
<p>Leaving Shanghai Today: The ship stayed in Shanghai for five days and was deeply impressed by the various places it visited. Having completed its mission, it is scheduled to leave Shanghai southbound at 10:30 AM today, first to Hong Kong, where it will stay for two or three days, and then to Singapore and Batavia to continue its voyage. It is scheduled to return to the port of Danzig in Poland in September of this year.</p>
<h3>Returned Refugees from Japan Arrive in Shanghai; 44th Group Arrives Yesterday; Return Home Aboard Japanese Ship "Asu Maru"; Shanghai-Based Compatriots Leave for Anhui to Cultivate Land Yesterday</h3>
<p>The number of returned refugees from Japan arriving in Shanghai has reached 44 groups. The 44th group, including refugees Liu Dayou and Wu Chaojun (from Fujian), arrived in Shanghai yesterday aboard the Japanese mail steamer "Asu Maru" in rather distressed conditions. According to refugee Wu Chaojun, who spoke to a reporter from the Industrial News Agency, the current Japanese policy of expelling overseas Chinese has undergone some changes. The Japanese are forcing overseas Chinese to resign from all their jobs, making it impossible for them to make a living in Japan, and thus forcing them to return home voluntarily. The poisonousness of this scheme is said to have reached its extreme. In other news, five Shanghai-based refugees, Pan Jinkai, Zhuo Yongfa, Xu Jinfa, Pan Jinfa, and Xu Jingeng, took the Sanbei Company's Qingpu transport yesterday morning to cultivate land in Qiaole Village, Xuancheng, Anhui.</p>
<h3>Bank of China Board Meeting Today; Held at 4 PM</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the Bank of China's shareholders' meeting resolved to increase the total capital stock to 40 million yuan, with the government and private sectors each holding half. The board of directors was authorized to negotiate with the Ministry of Finance. Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi has already indicated his acceptance. The bank's board of directors has decided to hold its first enlarged board meeting at 4 PM today on the third floor of the bank's building on the Bund, 3rd Ma Road.

<p>Chairman's Report</p>
<p>At 3:15 PM, all the guests had gathered, and the ceremony was announced by Lin Zeren, the factory secretary. After the rituals were performed, Chairman Liu Hongsheng gave a report, which briefly stated: "Today is the opening of the China Alcohol Factory. We are very honored to have guests from all walks of life participate. Regarding this factory, (1) Development Process: Our industrial authorities, in view of the development of road transportation in China in recent years, feel that liquid fuel is a very important element. However, most of the liquid fuel needed in China is imported and cannot be self-supplied, resulting in huge losses. Therefore, the Ministry of Industry listed it as one of the essential industries to be developed. Mr. Huang Zongxiao, an overseas Chinese, is the son of the late financier and industrialist Major Huang Zhonghan. Mr. Huang is particularly enthusiastic about developing the production industry in his motherland. He entrusted Jian Yuan Company to supervise Mr. Huang Jiangquan to invest in the motherland. The Ministry of Industry discussed cooperation with Mr. Huang Jiangquan based on the basic industrial plan. After repeated consultations between the two parties, it was decided to start with setting up a factory for manufacturing, with official-private joint management. This is the development process of the China Alcohol Factory. (2) Preparation Overview: In October of the 22nd year of the Republic of China (1933), the official and private parties signed a contract, with the initial capital set at 1 million national currency. Later, in order to maximize the effectiveness, the commercial party increased the total amount to 1.5 million national currency. Since the signing of the contract, we have begun to actively proceed, surveying the factory site, at Bailianjing in Pudong. Construction began on May 10th of the 23rd year of the Republic of China (1934), and the project was completed on November 10th of the same year. At the same time, the machinery was installed, and trial operation began. On December 1st, manufacturing began, and on December 5th, distillation began. It only took seven months from a wasteland in Bailianjing to the completion of the factory buildings and the production of products. (3) Product Overview: The alcohol of our factory is distilled by the latest British-invented three-tower distillation machine. These three towers are the distillation tower, the purification tower, and the alcohol tower. This kind of equipment is not only a pioneering effort in China, but also rare in Europe and America. Therefore, the alcohol content produced is 96.7%, which is about 2% higher than commercially available alcohol. Its quality is pure and excellent, comparable to the best products in various countries. The alcohol production of our factory is about 30,000 liters per day, equivalent to 7,000 English gallons. Production can be doubled next year. Two storage tanks are available for storing finished products. Based on the current production, it can store several months of products. In the past five years, the statistics of alcohol imports have averaged 2.7 million English gallons per year. Based on our factory's current production, about 2.55 million gallons are produced annually, which is currently sufficient to meet the urgent needs of our country. If the substitution of gasoline with alcohol is implemented in the future, the demand will increase further. In short, the preliminary solution to the problem of liquid fuel self-sufficiency has been achieved under the leadership of Minister of Industry Chen Gongbo, with the support of central and local agencies and local gentry and merchants, the enthusiastic planning of Mr. Huang Zongxiao, and the hard work of Mr. Huang Jiangquan, and has been declared a success. As for the company's scheduled expansion plan, Minister Chen, Vice Minister Liu, Director Liu, and various experts have spoken about it in detail in the opening commemorative album, so I will not repeat it here."</p>
<p>Minister's Speech</p>
<p>Minister of Industry Chen Gongbo delivered a speech, saying: "Today, at the opening ceremony of the China Alcohol Factory, I am participating in two capacities, as a guest and with administrative relations. The establishment of the China Alcohol Factory is not only a pleasure for the government and company authorities, but also a pleasure for the people of the whole country. There are two things to talk about today. The first point is that the current industrial construction in China can be said to be problematic in itself, and the government and the people need to work together to find solutions. For example, in the agricultural field, cotton, wheat, rice, and silk all urgently need to be improved. As for industry, whether light industry or heavy industry, both need to be developed. The alcohol factory is a very important unit in industry because it has close relations with many industries. Now that this industrial unit can be solved, it is hoped that other units related to agriculture and industry can also be solved step by step. The opening of the China Alcohol Factory today can be said to be the beginning of the realization of this plan. The second point I want to say is that the establishment of the China Alcohol Factory is nominally a joint venture between the government and business, but the government share accounts for only one-tenth. And this one-tenth of the government share is only to grant a ten-year exclusive right and protection in Jiangsu and Zhejiang as a consideration. The purpose of the government's approach is nothing more than to encourage the development of industry and to protect all fully commercial industries in the future. Therefore, it is hoped that overseas Chinese can invest in their motherland with technology and capital as much as possible to start industries, and at the same time, it is hoped that domestic compatriots will work together to manage the initial start of the industry. Of course, a period of arduous struggle must be experienced, such as the competition of foreign goods promotion and price levels, all of which must be studied and planned. As long as efforts are made, and it is hoped that everyone present and compatriots across the country will assist, it will not be difficult to gradually achieve the goal of success. Today, I sincerely wish the development of the China Alcohol Factory and look forward to the development of China's industry."</p>
<p>Chairman's Reply</p>
<p>Chairman Liu Hongsheng delivered a reply, briefly stating: "Today is the first day of the opening of our company. We are very honored to have guests from all walks of life come to guide us. Our factory will do its best to develop and expand all departments, under the guidance of the Ministry of Industry, in order to live up to the expectations of all parties. Hongsheng, on behalf of my colleagues, thanks everyone for your visit and wishes you good health."</p>
<p>Opening Ceremony and Tour</p>
<p>After the Chairman finished his reply, the opening ceremony was held. Led by the Chairman to the front door of the factory workshop on the left side of the auditorium, Minister Chen cut the red and green silk ribbon in front of the door with scissors. The door was opened amid applause from Chinese and foreign guests. Then Chairman Liu Hongsheng, Factory Director Tang Xiangxian, Chief Chemical Engineer Chen Zousheng, and other staff led the guests to visit the various departments and explained the uses of the various machines. After the tour, guests were served refreshments in the auditorium. At 5:30 PM, they took the special boat and happily returned to Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Commercial Acceptance Drafts to be Implemented Today; Chairman Luo Qinghua Asks All Sectors to Fully Support; Silk and Satin Associations Host Gathering Yesterday</h3>
<p>According to the New Voice News Agency, the Silk and Satin Industry Association and the Silk Weaving Industry Association will implement commercial acceptance drafts starting today. To make people understand its needs and benefits, they hosted leading figures from party, government, financial, and news circles, as well as various native place associations, at the Dadong Restaurant at 6 PM yesterday. Chairman Luo Qinghua and Cai Shengbai reported on the implementation methods. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Hosting All Sectors</p>
<p>Wu Xingya, Director of the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs, Section Chief Wu Huanru, and leading figures from various sectors Tang Shoumin, Ye Fuxiao, Mei Zhezhi, Wang Zhihua, Chen Zheqing, Qu Jigang, Jin Guobao, Lin Kanghou, Xu Jiyin, Li Quanshi, Zhang Naiqi, Yu Zuoting, Qian Chengxu, Wu Zhihao, Guo Shun, Jin Runyang, Ma Shaoquan, Hu Xiyuan, Zhu Yinong, and various native place associations such as Guangchao, Chuanjian, Quanxia, Gan, Yu, Lu, Xiang, E, Pingjin, and Yungui, as well as local associations Ji Zhongmou, Chen Yusheng, Cheng Yongliu, Cheng Hengjiu, Yang Changyan, Ma Ziying, Wang Shaoyu, Tao Yongjiang, and more than 500 people attended.</p>
<p>Chairman's Speech</p>
<p>Luo Qinghua, Chairman of the Silk and Satin Industry Association, delivered a speech, saying: "Today, our industry is holding a reception for leading figures from party, government, financial, and news circles, and representatives from various native place associations, to mark the scheduled implementation of commercial acceptance drafts. I am deeply honored that you have not abandoned us and have graced us with your guidance. Silk has a long history of over 4,000 years with the ancient Chinese nation. Its sales range all over the country and abroad. In the past, in addition to cash transactions, most goods were bought and sold on account. The method of extending credit varies from association to association, but the payments were generally cleared in three installments a year. In the past, when the market was not depressed and sales were booming, the trade was able to obtain the help of silver houses in facilitating loans and using limited funds to supply goods to the trades. However, in recent years, the world economy has been hit by the economic depression, and the provinces have suffered from frequent droughts and floods. Silk exports are far less than they used to be, and domestic consumption is also weakening day by day. Coupled with the financial industry's tightening of loans and efforts to preserve its own strength, economic circulation has become impossible to use in a flexible manner. Since the huge outflow of silver from Shanghai at the end of last year and the market's fear of it, the financial community has had to accumulate reserves and tighten credit. Many industries are therefore in a dilemma of being unable to circulate and being unable to advance or retreat. Our industry has thin profits, and its difficulties are no less than those of other industries, or even far greater than those of other industries. After initial discussions among the industry, it was agreed that the contraction of credit by the silver houses is not likely to improve in a short period of time, and the increase in sales of goods cannot be achieved overnight. Therefore, we can only make changes to the original method of extending credit, so as to increase the industry's chips without hindering the convenience of the trade. Therefore, the creation of commercial acceptance drafts. Although this type of draft is not commonly seen in China, it has long been used in countries in Europe and America where the credit system is fully developed. Not only are both buyers and sellers said to be convenient, but the financial community also has a safe way to plant profits. Currently, the two most difficult problems faced by the industrial and commercial sectors are stagnation. The reason why the accounts are stagnant is that the payment of various goods in credit transactions does not use commercial paper, so that the seller needs to pay capital for a product, and the buyer has difficulty in preparing for the payment on festivals. The financial community also finds it difficult to promote its business because of the lack of corresponding tools for commercial credit. That is because the system of commercial paper acceptance has not been implemented, which has made the production, sales, and financial aspects suffer. Now, if we can transform the old method of payment for the delivery receipts into negotiable acceptance drafts, then the seller can hold the acceptance draft to the silver house after selling the goods to discount the cash for circulation. For the buyer, the payment is made on a fixed date, so that there is no lack of preparation, and compared with the previous method of clearing accounts on festivals, it can achieve the effect of paying in installments easily. This is a steady way to solve the current lack of chips in this industry. Since the proposal of this industry, experts from all parties have expressed their approval and believe that this acceptance draft is in full compliance with the requirements stipulated by the negotiable instruments law. If it can be widely implemented, it will not only be sufficient to relieve the current temporary economic panic, but also be of great benefit to the promotion and development of industrial and commercial undertakings in the future. Financial leaders also believe that in this time of increasing credit contraction and panic, only the industrial sector can automatically create credit tools to save the situation. Therefore, they are very happy to help with this newly created paper after its implementation. The Central Bank has also repeatedly requested to allow commercial banks to rediscount it. Our industry believes that the creation of this draft has been enthusiastically supported by the academic, business, financial, and other circles. We should expedite its realization. Therefore, after discussions at the joint meeting of the Silk and Satin Industry Association and the Electrical Silk Weaving Industry Association, it was decided to officially implement it on April 1st. At the initial stage of the implementation of this new system, we are deeply concerned that the public may not fully understand it. Therefore, we have made a brief report on the causes and consequences of our industry's creation of this acceptance draft. We hope that the trade can understand the current difficulties of our industry and do its best to support it. We especially hope that party and government agencies will vigorously promote it and that commercial organizations will work together to implement it. Then the success will not be far away. However, this matter is of great importance, and it is impossible to benefit without gathering ideas. Therefore, we especially hope that economic experts will not hesitate to teach us and elaborate on it in theory. As for the support in strength, the financial leaders cannot help but express their expectations. I sincerely hope that this trial of our industry can complete the mission of creation with the support of all parties. It will not only be a great fortune for the industry but also the supreme gospel for the industrial and commercial sectors." Cai Shengbai, Chairman of the Electrical Silk Weaving Industry Association, reported on the acceptance draft, briefly stating that several companies in the electrical silk weaving industry have already implemented it for several years, and in fact there have been no difficulties. This type of draft benefits both buyers and sellers. If there are difficulties in implementation, our industry will always humbly learn and ask for advice. In short, this draft system is complete, and we must trust and understand each other in order to achieve the goal of regulating the financial situation of the entire market. We do not express distrust of any party, but take this action."</p>

<h3>Report on the Tragic Situation in the Disaster Areas of Anhui Province</h3>
<p>The World Red Swastika Society's Central and Southern Anhui Office reported that the disaster situation in Anhui Province is tragic and urgently in need of relief. Yesterday, it specially dispatched Representative Zhou Genjing, the president, to Shanghai to report to the Shanghai General Office the tragic situation in the disaster areas throughout Anhui Province, which is unbearable to read. The report is excerpted below: Disaster areas cover 49 counties in the entire Anhui Province, with 9 million disaster victims. The early disaster area is approximately 18 million mu. After the flood twenty years ago, the reserves were empty. In addition, banditry raged, and vitality was lost again and again. Now, it has suffered an early disaster, and the famine victims are everywhere. The water plants have been completely collected, and the bark of the trees has been completely peeled. The disaster victims mostly use two types of soil, Guanyin soil and bran, to fill their hunger, and many suffer from abdominal distension and die. There are often cases of families committing suicide. Children of three or two years old are only worth a few yuan, and the sound of crying shakes the wilderness, reaching the tragic point of separation of life and death. In large and small villages, there is no sound of chickens and dogs, and ten houses out of ten are empty. How can the mournful remnants bear it? All of these tragic situations are true and tragic situations that we have witnessed during our on-site inspections and emergency relief efforts. Now, the spring season is beginning, and the new wheat can be harvested until the beginning of summer. In these few months, it is a critical time for the survival of the disaster victims. In other words, they will live if they are given relief, and they will die if they are not given relief. Our cotton strength is limited, and we cannot bear to sit idly by when we see this tragic situation. We sincerely weep and cry for help for the millions of disaster victims in the disaster areas. One yuan can save a person's life, and ten yuan, a hundred yuan, a thousand yuan, or ten thousand yuan can save ten, a hundred, a thousand, or ten thousand people's lives. The Buddha said, "Saving a life is better than building a seven-story pagoda." I hope that benevolent people and benefactors will</p>
<h3>Ministry of Finance Approves Yünli Factory's Industrial Salt Usage; Permission Granted for Annual Purchase of 10,000 Dan</h3>
<p>Industrialists Xue Mingjian and others, considering ammonium carbonate and other substances essential for industrial production, established the Yünli Chemical Factory outside the West Gate of Wuxi. In addition to the already established carbonate factory, lime factory, and stone sulfur factory, they recently planned to use salt to manufacture bleaching powder, caustic soda, pure alkali, and green ammonia products. However, the market price of ordinary salt is more than 12 yuan per dan. If approved for industrial use, the price would only be more than 1 yuan per dan. Therefore, the factory specially submitted a request to the Ministry of Industry and the Ministry of Finance, requesting permission to issue industrial salt. After investigation by officials from both ministries, the request was confirmed to be true. The factory received joint instructions yesterday from the Songjiang Salt Transport Deputy Envoy's Office and the Salt Affairs Audit Branch, stating that, according to the Ministry of Finance's instructions, permission was granted to purchase 10,000 dan of industrial salt annually.</p>

<p>The local postal administration will open a lightweight parcel service starting today. The weight of the parcel must not exceed one kilogram. The delivery method is the same as that of letters.

<h3>Japanese Car Causes Accident on Shanghai-Minhang Road; Two Children Struck on Roadside</h3>
<p>Yesterday was Sunday, and it was sunny after the rain. Tourists and tomb sweepers on Longhua and Shanghai-Minhang Road in southern Shanghai came and went. At about 10:00 a.m., a Japanese man and woman were traveling from Shanghai to Minhang in a private car. When passing Beiqiao, they hit two children on the side of Zhennan Road. One was hit on the head, and the injury seemed light. The other had a broken leg, and amputation seemed inevitable. After the incident, pedestrians on the road came forward to negotiate and called the police nearby. Because they were Japanese, the perpetrators could not be detained, and only the license plate on the car was taken down. The car continued to drive to Minhang. The injured children were only three or four years old and were the children of nearby small grocery store owners. They have been sent to Minhang Hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3>Runaway Wife Unwilling to Return Home, Jumps from Car and Gets Injured, Escorts Also Injured, Passersby Suspect Kidnapping</h3>
<p>Chang Fu-lin, a villager from outside the North Gate of Changzhou, is twenty-seven years old this year and makes a living by farming. He married a woman named Li, also from the same village, who is twenty-eight years old this year. They have been married for years and already have children. Although Ms. Li comes from a rural background, she possesses a certain rough beauty. Although she is approaching middle age, she still has a seductive charm. She often complained that her husband was stupid, cowardly, and ugly, and was restless in her marriage. Last year, she secretly ran away from her husband to Shanghai, claiming to be a worker, but in reality, she was living with a lover. After his wife disappeared, Chang searched for her everywhere, but found no news of her until recently, when a fellow villager met her in Shanghai and learned that she lived in the Chinese territory outside the West Gate. Chang then invited several relatives and friends, including Zhou Ao-da, and brought credentials to Shanghai. They went to the address and found his wife, Li. At that time, her lover happened to be out. However, Ms. Li refused to go with her husband. Chang called the police, and the Second District Public Security Bureau learned that the case involved a wife running away from her husband. They ordered her to be sent to the local court for investigation. After interrogation by the prosecutor, she was detained for review. Later, the judge allowed Chang Fu-lin to provide a guarantee and take Ms. Li back to reunite with him. He scolded and advised her, and then ordered Chang to take her away. Chang planned to take the train back to his hometown that day, but fearing that she would resist along the way and that it would be inconvenient to take care of her during the journey, Chang hired a rental car No. 12567 from the Sino-Western Automobile Company at 465 Caishi Road in the French Concession, driven by driver Liu Dian-qing, to the local court. Chang took his wife, Li, and several others, including Zhou Ao-da, who had come with him, into the car, and ordered the driver to drive directly to the North Railway Station, intending to take the evening train back to Changzhou that day. Unexpectedly, when the car passed the Yongtai-xiang Tobacco and Paper Store at 144 Lafayette Road in the French Concession, the driver slowed down to avoid pedestrians and vehicles in front of them. Who knew that Ms. Li seized the opportunity to jump out of the car, trying to escape. Zhou Ao-da, who was in the same car, also jumped down to chase her regardless of everything. Because the car was still moving, both she and Zhou fell to the ground after jumping out, as they couldn't stand still. Ms. Li's face and arms were scratched by the road surface, and Zhou injured his head. Both were covered in blood, with Zhou's injuries being more serious. Neither of them could get up. Chang immediately ordered the driver to stop and jumped down to drag Ms. Li back into the car. While they were struggling, passersby and shopkeepers on both sides, initially unclear about the reason, mistakenly thought it was a kidnapping or forced abduction of a woman, and rose up in indignation. They immediately called the French Concession police station, which sent detectives to take the injured Chang Li, Zhou Ao-da, to Guangci Hospital for treatment. At the same time, Chang Fu-lin and others, along with the car, were taken to the police station. After investigation by the police, the head of the police was informed and ordered Chang Li and Zhou Da, the two injured (who had already been dressed and bandaged by the doctor), to be taken out of the hospital and sent back to Changzhou by the original car with Chang Fu-lin. Because Ms. Li was in pain from her injuries, she did not dare to resist anymore after leaving the police station. Thus, a humorous drama of finding a wife came to an end.</p>

<h3>Westerners' Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Holds Animal Protection Painting Competition, Location: 116 Nanjing Road, Starting from the 11th</h3>
<p>The Westerners' Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals in this city will hold a regular painting competition on the theme of animal protection. The Chinese Animal Protection Association has sent a letter to the Municipal Education Bureau asking it to instruct all primary and secondary school students in the city to visit the exhibition at the appropriate time to promote animal protection.

<h3>Soy Sauce and Liquor Industry to Increase Prices from April 1st Due to Business Decline and Frequent Cost Increases</h3>
<p>The Soy Sauce Garden Industry, Soy Sauce and Liquor Industry, Liang Shao Liquor Industry, and Fen Liquor Industry Associations in this city have recently stated that due to the economic downturn, business decline, and inconsistent selling prices among the same industry, resulting in self-competition, the consequences would be unimaginable if not rectified immediately. Therefore, after a joint meeting, it was decided to comply with the actual selling prices and abide by them uniformly. The implementation date reported yesterday was slightly incorrect. The notice from the industry association is recorded below: "Notice: Regarding the rectification of liquor prices, our liquor industry, including liquor stores, hotels, soy sauce gardens, and distilleries, all sell and distribute liquor. However, although the costs are the same, the selling prices are different. Recently, due to the economic downturn and sluggish business, suspicion and competition have arisen, even disregarding costs. Weaker businesses find it difficult to maintain. Moreover, commerce is exhausted, finance is extremely tight, the cost of liquor raw materials has been rising frequently, and wholesale prices have also increased accordingly. All of us in the same industry are in a difficult situation. If this chaos continues without rectification, the consequences would be unimaginable. Therefore, we invited the four public groups to hold a joint meeting and agreed on actual selling prices to help the liquor industry overcome difficulties and maintain capital. In addition to submitting a report to the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau for record, starting from April 1st, all members of the industry must comply with the agreed liquor prices and not deviate again. The industry is very fortunate. This is a special notice."</p>
<h3>Pudong Electric Company Held Shareholders Meeting Yesterday, Last Year's Profit Reached Over 140,000, Decided to Expand Capital to 1 Million</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Pudong Electric Co., Ltd. held its 17th annual shareholders' meeting at the Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association on Xizang Road at 2:00 p.m. yesterday. More than 100 people including Lu Bo-hong and Huang Ren-zhi attended. The meeting reported on the company's operating conditions for the past year, profit distribution, amendment of the articles of association, and re-election of directors and supervisors. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>After the chairman announced the opening of the meeting, Zhao Jin-qing was elected as the chairman. Zhao reported that the world economic panic in 1934 became more serious, and the industrial and commercial sectors in the city declined daily. The company's operation of local public utilities is closely related to the prosperity and decline of the economy. Under such a dangerous environment, it is also deeply affected. In addition, due to the separation of the Huangpu River and the lack of municipal construction, it will be more difficult to seek business development. Fortunately, with the sincere support of the shareholders and the diligent work of the colleagues, most of the plans can be carried out in an orderly manner. The business performance is not only not inferior to previous years, but also has significant progress. After the expansion of capital, the profits obtained can also be increased proportionally, which is especially gratifying to the shareholders, etc.</p>
<p>Regarding the business situation, Tong Ji-tong, director and general manager of the company, read the business situation and revenue and expenditure account. He stated that because the power supply is sufficient, the company actively expanded its lines. The fifth district of Shanghai County and the fifth district of Nanhui County were not powered due to their remote location. Last year, at the request of merchants, power lines were laid from Sanlin-tang to Yunxi, Central River, Chenjia-hang, Tangkou, and Tiqiao and other towns, which were completed in August. Other areas such as Gao-hang District, Lu-hang District, Yangjing District, Tangqiao District, and Yangsi District were also energized and illuminated successively last year. Last year, the highest power supply load reached 2,830 kilowatts, an increase of 1,060 kilowatts compared with the previous year. The total power sales volume was more than 9.9 million kilowatt-hours, an increase of 52% compared with the previous year. The various electricity charges collected also increased by 32% compared with the previous year. The overhead lines laid were 245 kilometers long, an increase of 63 kilometers compared with the previous year. The total number of electric poles was more than 8,000, an increase of more than 1,800 compared with the previous year. The business area has included the entire Pudong area of Shanghai City and Shanghai County, and a part of Nanhui Chuansha County. In the near future, such towns as Zhangjiang-zha, Hengmian, and Zhoupu, and as far as Nanhui County, will purchase electricity from the company for distribution. In the future, the power and light will be able to cover all the large and small cities and towns east of the Huangpu River, and the power grid of Greater Pudong will be successfully completed. He then reported that after offsetting last year's revenue and expenditure, the surplus was 142,818 yuan and 6 cents, and then discussed the distribution of dividends.</p>
<p>Regarding the expansion of capital, the amendment of the articles of association was discussed, and it was decided that the total capital should be expanded to 1 million yuan. The added 200,000 yuan will be collected within two years and handed over to the board of directors for implementation. Article 2 of the company's articles of association is planned to be changed to "The company's business area includes the entire Pudong area under the jurisdiction of Shanghai City and Shanghai County, and the three parts of Nanhui Chuansha County, which have been approved and registered by the government authorities and protected as a whole."</p>
<p>Regarding the re-election of directors and supervisors, 11 directors and 3 supervisors were re-elected. The elected directors were Tong Ji-tong, Zhang Chan-fen, Tong Shou-min, Wu Yun-zhai, Zhao Jin-qing, Yang Ding-chen, Lu Bo-hong, He Jing-zhi, Feng Bing-nan, Qian Xin-zhi, and Xiang Sheng-wu. The elected supervisors were Huang Ren-zhi, Wang Zhong-xie, and Shan Yun-gong. The meeting adjourned after refreshments.</p>

<h3>Fellow Villagers from Shaoxing Initiate Formation of Yue Opera Improvement Research Society</h3>
<p>Liu Chun-fan and others who traveled in Yue, considering that the plots of Yue opera are quite fascinating, but the lyrics are outdated and difficult to cater to the trend, so that good art is lost, if they can engage in research and improvement, it is not difficult to gain a foothold in Chun-shen and create a unique style. Therefore, they specially summoned more than 30 like-minded people to organize the Yue Opera Improvement Research Society, which has already drafted the articles of association for filing with various levels of government. It is also heard that once the society is well prepared, it plans to invite Wang Xiao-xiang, a well-known Yue native living in Shanghai, to be the honorary president.</p>

<p>Yesterday was a holiday, and it was also the day when the New Life Movement Youth Service Corps in this city set out to serve. All eleven branch corps in the city, totaling about 500 groups, were led by their respective group leaders to go out to various roads, thoroughfares, and alleys to persuade citizens to implement the New Life. The members were energetic. Wherever they went, the general households and pedestrians paid attention, especially women and children. The members wore armbands, and when they encountered people smoking on the street, baring their arms and chests, or wearing their hats and clothes improperly or soiled, they would step forward to persuade them to pay attention. Those who heard were ashamed and blushed. After several services by the corps in this city, the appearance of the city has indeed changed considerably. If it can be sustained, the future results will be significant. It is heard that the corps will take a further step next time and will be responsible for rectifying the appearance of the city and directing traffic.

<h3>Youth Carrying Volunteer Letter, Director Liu Cleared and Released</h3>
<p>The police officer of the Yimiao Police Station in Nanshi checked a pedestrian at the Shiliupu the previous day and found that a young man was carrying several red-paper printed volunteer letters with the words "Mou Shan" on them. He was taken to the station at that time. According to the young man's confession, his name was Chen Yu-yong, 19 years old, from Hubei. The volunteer letter was entrusted to him by a fellow villager living in Yong'anli to be taken to Pudong and handed over to a friend, etc. However, Director Liu, for the sake of prudence, ordered the police to go to the address to check at any time. When they arrived, they saw that the four walls were covered with slogans of propriety, righteousness, integrity, shame, filial piety, brotherly love, loyalty, and faith, and various New Life Movement slogans. The portrait of General Sun Yat-sen was also hung high in the center, and they were all intellectuals from the military, political, commercial, and academic circles. The content was aimed at mutual encouragement. After Director Liu reported back, he released Chen immediately, as it was a legitimate action.</p>
<h3>Two Fires in Nanshi and Zhabei, Two Houses Burned on Jiangyin Street, Only Two Quilts Burned in Zhabei</h3>

In an instant, the fire spread and could not be approached. The police officer Sun Cui-pie of the jurisdiction saw it and immediately notified the fire brigades of the Western District, etc. by telephone. The fire trucks rushed to the scene and tried their best to put out the fire. The fire was extinguished at about 11:00 p.m. It is estimated that the front building and the loft on the ground floor were burned down. Afterwards, Director Tang of the Wenmiao Road Police Station sent police to investigate the cause of the fire. The shop owner Ma Lan-bo had gone out, so his wife Liu was taken to the station for questioning. Also, the house of Qiu Hui-zhi, a resident of No. 124 Zhangjia-xiang Road, Zhabei, caught fire at 11:30 p.m. the previous night. Fortunately, it was discovered by neighbors, who notified the fire brigades of each section of Zhabei to send fire brigades to the scene to put out the fire. Only two quilts were burned, but the general neighbors rushed to move and grab objects to escape, and have already suffered a false alarm.</p>
<h3>Notorious Robbers Heavily Sentenced Everywhere</h3>

Investigation revealed that the gangsters had committed many cases separately: (1) Between March 6 and 25 of this year, they held weapons and gathered a gang to rob the Chen Shui-tang family at No. 19 Baoqingli, Lane 247, Qipu Road, but failed; (2) At 8:00 p.m. on January 2 of this year, they robbed the Weng Zhi-an family at No. 941 Qiqihar Road of clothes and silver worth 128 yuan; (3) On January 30 of last year, they robbed the Taiyuanheng Silver Furnace in Qingyuanli, Beijing Road, of more than 10,000 yuan of silver bars and goldware, etc. A gun was seized. Investigation revealed that the gun was stolen from the fourth team of the South District Security Group in November of the year before last. Dai Yong-lin and other defendants were sent to the First Special District Court, and the details of their confessions have been recorded in this newspaper. They were instructed to wait for sentencing. Yesterday, Judge Wu Ze-bao presided over the third criminal court and sentenced Dai Cheng-lin to 13 years of imprisonment, Yang Jin-long to 8 years, Hu Fu-seven years, Jiang Jin-lian, Huang Han-cheng, and Lin Ke-mei to 3 years and 6 months each, Yu Yong-sheng and Wang San-mei to 8 months of imprisonment each.

<h3>Two Cases of Abduction on Qingdao Maru, Wang Zhao-di and Chen Gui-bao</h3>
<p>Wang Zhao-di, a woman from Changzhou, is 29 years old and has a decent appearance. Recently, due to the famine and poor harvest in her hometown and the difficulty of life, she resolutely came to China and stayed temporarily at the home of her sister Zhao Wang in Gaolangqiao. Then Zhao Wang asked someone to recommend Zhao-di to work at the nearby Dafeng Rice Store. Because the guest and host were not in harmony, she quit shortly after. Zhao-di returned to her sister's home and supported herself by needlework. It was unexpected that Zhao Wang had ulterior motives and led Zhao-di out for an evaluation on the pretext of going to the Great World to play. Zhao-di saw with her own eyes that her sister was talking to an old woman for a long time before they dispersed. The next day, the old woman suddenly came to Zhao Wang's home and talked secretly with Zhao Tu, after which Zhao Wang ordered Zhao-di to go to the factory with the old woman to work. Zhao-di was an ignorant and weak woman and did not suspect anything else. Unexpectedly, as soon as they left the door, the old woman hired a car in advance, waiting for them there. So they got into the car and drove straight to the wheel port and left the car to board the boat (the Qingdao Maru steamer bound for Fengtian). At that time, investigators Chen Shao-ting and Lin Yong-fang from the relief society happened to be investigating the ship. When they saw the old woman looking flustered, they interrogated her. The old woman's surname was Liu Zhou, 54 years old, from Yangzhou. The rest of the words were vague. The members knew that she was abducting and questioned Wang Zhao-di again. At this point, Zhao-di woke up from her dream and wept. She revealed everything and said that the old woman regarded each other as mother and daughter in the car and were going to work in Fengtian together. There was an extreme shortage of female workers there, and they could get a salary of more than ten yuan a month. Now she knew she had been fooled and asked for rescue. The members detained the old woman and reported to the Water Patrol Police Station by telephone, and sent detectives Huang Song-sheng and Li Wen-qi to come. Unexpectedly, the investigator found another abduction case similar to the above in the cabin of the ship. The abducted was Chen Gui-bao, a 21-year-old woman from Jia. The abductor was Wang Jin-biao from Yangzhou. Therefore, the male and female abductors and the two abducted women were taken to the police station and transferred to the local court for interrogation yesterday.</p>

<h3>Jin Cheng Bank's 1934 Business Report (18)</h3>
<p>In terms of agricultural product imports, rice, wheat, and cotton all decreased. This is because after China increased import taxes, the cost of foreign rice and wheat increased, making them difficult to sell. The successful trial planting of American cotton in the Yu-Shaan region resulted in a very abundant cotton crop this year, and domestic transportation construction made transportation more convenient. This is the reason for the decrease in agricultural product imports. This year's import of rice and grains was 7,710,610 hectoliters, a decrease of 40.48% compared to last year's 12,954,001 hectoliters. Wheat imports were 4,649,419 hectoliters, a decrease of 56.61% compared to last year's 10,714,634 hectoliters. Cotton decreased less, with 1,163,223 hectoliters this year, a decrease of 3.55% compared to last year's 1,206,067 hectoliters. Other grains also declined, with wheat flour having the largest decrease at 69.56%. In short, as the Chinese people recognize the seriousness of the rural decline, those advocating for rural revitalization have gradually put it into practice. For example, this year's guidance on agricultural technology, improvements in agricultural product transportation and sales, adjustments to the rural economy, and establishment of agricultural organizations (according to the Central Agricultural Examination Institute, there are already 691 places) have shown significant progress. Therefore, in this year of disaster, it is a commendable phenomenon that agricultural imports have decreased. (5) Industry: This year, due to falling prices, decreased purchasing power of the general public, and dumping of foreign goods, domestic industries not only did not progress but also showed a tendency to decline. Among them, the silk reeling industry was the most affected. Other industries such as spinning, flour milling, match making, and daily necessities also declined, but to varying degrees. Only a brief overview of the situation is provided below: (A) Textile Industry: The most difficult aspect of the textile industry this year was the decline in cotton yarn prices, which was far greater than the decline in cotton prices. The average annual price of standard yarn in 1933 was 186.20 yuan per bale, while the average annual price this year was only 173.65 yuan, the lowest figure in nearly ten years, a difference of 12.75 yuan, or 6.84%, compared to last year. The average price of standard cotton in 1933 was 44.10 yuan per picul, while in 1934 it was 43.75 yuan. Although there was a decline, it was only 0.79%, less than 1%. The decline in the price of cotton yarn products—cloth—was even greater than that of yarn. The average price of 15-pound coarse cloth this year was 6.45 yuan, a decrease of 9.15% compared to last year's lowest average price of 7.10 yuan. In addition, after the implementation of the new tariff this year, the tax rate on cotton goods imports was reduced by 10% to 50%, while the tax rate on cotton imports was increased by 43%. When there is no sufficient supply of long-staple cotton domestically, the yarn industry is more difficult to progress under this influence. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Snippets</h3>
<p>— (Yun Shang)</p>
<p>The spring chill is still sharp, but spring is arriving. Men are still mostly wearing cotton clothing, while women are already floating about in light, single-layered qipaos. In this respect, women are certainly able to catch up and be the first to embrace the latest trends, becoming pioneers of an era.</p>
<p>As soon as spring arrives in the human world, the young masters become busy again. They engage in fierce competition to pursue the opposite sex, probably just like buzzing bees busily gathering honey in the flower bushes, all for the sake of the maxim "The year's plan begins in spring."</p>
<p>When a young woman feels spring in her heart, a gentleman tempts her. In spring, this kind of drama seems to emerge endlessly.</p>
<p>Spring is lovely; but at night, when you hear the frantic cries of cats, and the cotton blanket on you feels too hot, and you toss and turn in bed unable to sleep soundly, you feel that spring is hateful again.</p>
<h3>Spring Sunshine</h3>
<p>— Shi Kun</p>
<p>The god of spring has arrived! The sun, too, seems to have changed its original appearance, following the blessings of the god of spring.</p>
<p>It—the spring sun—uses its kind face and soft wrists to caress the small grass on the ground into growth and bring out the green buds on the treetops. Even more, it bestows upon the youth a spirit of enterprise and leads them on the path of united struggle.</p>
<p>Ah! How great you are!</p>
<p>The small grass, nurtured by the spring sun, gradually grows tall! Shedding its withered, yellowed old clothes, it dons brand new emerald green garments, swaying gently, as if thanking him for his kindness.</p>
<p>The willow, softening its waist, wearing a bright green long dress, is proud and carefree, constantly saluting the spring sun with the utmost respect, expressing its unwillingness to part from the spring sun, hoping to always frolic together.</p>
<p>The youth! Receiving the spring sun's guidance, work diligently, advancing on the path of brightness and uprightness, striving amidst hardship and perseverance, doing their best to find their future! Ah! How great a favor they receive from the spring sun!</p>
<p>And also those many insects, birds, and beasts; controlled by the harsh winter, they hibernate in their nests, how weary and bored! Now they hear all the new sounds of the earth, knowing that the seasons have been renewed and the climate has changed! Thus, they crawl out of their long-inhabited, tiresome nests and seek their new lives in the embrace of nature.</p>
<p>Ah! How great the spring sun is! It can awaken everything in the world. I hope you will stay in the world forever.</p>
<h3>Spring Rain</h3>
<p>— Zhou Xian</p>
<p>The spring rain is always like fine powder ground out of a mill, dancing with the light breeze. The streets are so muddy that walking is truly unpleasant, especially when a car speeds past, splashing the mud onto your clothes, making you wish you could escape the city and return to your hometown.</p>
<p>Indeed, in my hometown, there are mountains, water, forests, and fields. When this spring rain like fine powder drifts down, I only need to push open the wooden door to see the natural scenery shrouded in the smoky, misty spring rain. The fields are all green, but the green mountains, tinted by the smoky spring rain, are shaded layer upon layer, the faintest retaining only a misty, blue-gray hue, truly like a natural painting.</p>
<p>The birds in the woods in front of the house chirp and twitter all day long, making a constant racket. Swallows, in the mist-like spring rain, constantly carry mud to build their nests. Children, barefoot, catch tadpoles in the pond. Sometimes, a sound or two of oars comes from the river behind the pond, which seems to have a special rhythm in the rain.</p>
<p>Those walking on the field ridges wear straw hats and rain capes. From afar, it is almost impossible to distinguish whether they are farmers or fishermen, but when you get closer, you often find an unexpected discovery: it is actually a very robust girl!</p>
<p>But, in the city, oh, the spring rain is the same, but all I have is an unpleasant mood.</p>
<h3>Spring Colors in the Park</h3>
<p>— Chonglou</p>
<p>Some people say, "There is no spring in the city!" I think this statement is an exaggeration.</p>
<p>For example, in the city's parks, we can at least see or find some signs of spring.</p>
<p>In order to explore spring, on a clear and bright morning, Dieyu and I stepped into the gates of Zhaofeng Park.</p>
<p>Perhaps we went too early, as many children had already arrived before us. They were jumping in the warm sunlight and dancing on the green lawn. They were truly a happy group.</p>
<p>Because of good management, flowers were blooming everywhere in the park, and the willows by the lake had also sprouted tender buds. Several white geese were playing on the water in the lake; and the sailboats of Lilliput were blown back and forth by the spring breeze in the ripples.</p>
<p>We sat for a while in the pavilion beside the rockery, chewing on the spearmint gum we had brought. Looking up, we saw several kites swaying in the sky, seeming very pleased with themselves.</p>
<p>I took two photos of Dieyu under the blooming peach tree branches. This can be considered a memento of our half-day spring outing.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, I was dragged into Hongkou Park by Bijun.</p>
<p>The scene we saw here was different. There were many male and female athletes here, all of whom were enthusiastic about sports. Of course, spring is their most active time, so most of the land in the park was occupied by their football, tennis, baseball, and other ball games.</p>
<p>We walked past a small stream and saw several fishing rods equipped with machinery hanging by the stream. I looked at the people fishing and felt amused. How many small fish could there be in such a shallow and small stream? Why was it necessary to use such a machine fishing rod? This is truly a "fuss about nothing."</p>
<p>Smelling the fragrance of the flowers and listening to the birdsong in the park, I felt comfortable and a smile appeared on my face. If the curtain of night had not already been drawn, I would not have been willing to leave.</p>
<p>###江南’s Spring</p>
<p>— A Leaf</p>
<p>"I love spring, I especially love the spring in Jiangnan. I love Jiangnan, and I love Jiangnan in spring even more." I remember clearly, this was what I said to a southern girl a few years ago. At that time, she was asking for my impressions of coming here.</p>
<p>This wasn't to please a woman; it was just that the lovely colors of Jiangnan's spring were too tempting to me. Whether on hillsides, fields, bridgeheads, or riverbanks, you can always see it: a kind of intoxicating green is smudged on willow branches, grass leaves, and the water surface. This color is like a hazy green sea, containing the hearts of young people, loving dreams, the innocent smiles of children, a prelude to the stage of life.</p>
<p>I know that spring exists everywhere, but it may not be like the spring in Jiangnan anywhere else. Perhaps the god of spring has specially applied an extra layer of green paint here. Recently, when I was about to go from Shanghai to Hangzhou, a teacher said to me: "You should bring a few more bottles of powdered green oil paint. When painting in West Lake at this time, this kind of paint is most useful." He wouldn't lie to me. As soon as the train passed Longhua, the scenery along the way was full of the colors of the painting materials that my teacher wanted me to bring. I smiled with a sense of accomplishment, and the train sped excitedly towards the leisurely green sea.</p>
<p>At this time, I thought of Oscar Wilde of England. This artist who loved green, his velvet coat, his large tie, were all green. Don't his "Salomé" and "The Picture of Dorian Gray" all contain a subtle sense of green, a green mood?</p>
<p>I saw the colors of aestheticism in the spring of Jiangnan; the green Jiangnan, the artistic spring of Jiangnan...</p>
<h3>The Spring of Sea Cloud Cave</h3>
<p>— Wang Fang'an</p>
<p>The inscription on my humble dwelling says: "Mountains are not judged by their height, but by the presence of immortals." If we use these words to describe our Mount Chao, perhaps everyone would agree that it is appropriate.</p>
<p>This time, the Song Plum outside Bao Ci Temple has already turned the branches green. At leisure, on this day when peach and plum blossoms are blooming, the warm spring breeze blows me to the side of Sea Cloud Cave.</p>
<p>I firmly believe that the scenic beauty of Mount Chao is not only when the plum blossoms bloom, with fragrant snow forming a sea and a subtle fragrance drifting about, creating a magnificent sight. At this time of brilliant spring, if you climb up and look around, it will not diminish your carefree spirit. Now, I am going alone in a small boat. As I gently float through the rippling waters of Ding Shan Lake, I can't help but look back at the lovely, welcoming green peaks. When I abandon the boat and go ashore, slowly climbing the mountain path to Sea Cloud Cave, this scene, this scenery, truly makes me feel as if I have entered a painting, almost forgetting the troubles of the human world.</p>
<p>Sea Cloud Cave is located in the east of the peak of Mount Chao, high on the left side of the Qian Yuan Temple. From here, there are stone steps. The cave entrance is wide like a flat ground, covered with green pines and bamboo, like a green cloud. Running into the cave, you gradually feel the gloom and depth. In the early days, people burned torches to enter, but they never found the source and exit. Down below is a water cave, with stone steps leading down. The sound of the spring is gurgling and faintly audible. The spring water flows into the Qian Yuan Temple, in front of the small pavilion, and gathers into a natural swamp. The trickling water all comes from the crevices between the rocks. Here, there are even rugged, strange rocks, like broken walls offering tablets. It seems to give people the feeling of jade shoots, agate hairpins, jumping pearls, and chiming harps. In addition, there are also the stone statues of Ding Xixuan and his son from the Ming Dynasty, and Shen Wangyun, carved into a house, with carvings on all four sides, from which we can see a glimpse of the art of the past.</p>
<p>If I were to introduce some more about the history and literature of Sea Cloud Cave, then, Zhao Zhongxian of the Song Dynasty once built the Black Dragon Five Caves here. Here are the handwriting of Zhao Qingxian of the Song Dynasty, the three large characters of Sea Cloud Cave, carved on the stone wall. There are also stone carvings of poems by Zhao and the Ding family and his son, as well as Wu Changshuo's five-character verse, carved on the steep rocks. There is also the tombstone of the Ding family written by Wen Zhengming hidden in the Qian Yuan Temple, and the statue of Liu Lan. Who says there is not enough to linger and enjoy?</p>
<p>These are truly enough to make people remember, let alone Sea Cloud Cave. However, in this brilliant spring, we can also see from afar the snail-like mountain peaks, the tender green willow branches, the non-red peach blossoms, and the golden-yellow vegetable plots, placing the ridges and fields around the mountains one by one at our feet. What's more, the Qiantang Sea Gate is also as if it is hidden and appears before our eyes. Ah! Who says the scenic beauty of Mount Chao is not Sea Cloud Cave? Ming Dynasty Ding Dawu's travelogue here says: "Truly a picture opened by heaven, making people feel as if they are in Qingxia Cave, so why must they actually step on the three islands and ten continents to be called a fairyland?" These truly describe its wonderful realm enough.</p>
<p>Friends, may you not forget the spring of Sea Cloud Cave in this brilliant spring.</p>
<h3>Spring Rhapsody</h3>
<p>— Chen Liang</p>
<p>Move that rosewood swivel chair to the sun deck, bathe in the bright and warm sunlight in the relaxed afternoon air. Beside you is a low table, a collection of poems, a pot of pre-Qingming tea, and a tin of light cigarettes. Sitting so leisurely, a warm breath slowly rises from your crotch to your spine, to every cell in your face, swelling, swelling, feeling warm, is that indescribable feeling.</p>
<p>"In the third month comes Qingming, peach blossoms and willows are in full bloom"... This singing floats up from the street, and just as I was about to listen carefully, it stopped again. Various people still walked on the street in a mixed manner. The chestnut cake vendor attracted a group of gluttonous children around him. Their little faces had an excited color and luster. Two or three were not wearing long coats, revealing bright red and green woolen sweaters. The girls' bodies were also thinner, wearing so little. Their postures were lively, with bright sunshine on their faces.</p>
<p>Mixed in the crowd, several bicycles rushed out with a "ding-a-ling, ding-a-ling" sound. Peach blossoms and willow branches were tied to the front or behind the seat, pink and tender green, tender green and pink. This tone contains a strong stimulating effect. It will make a calm person restless, it will make a lonely person react to their own monotony even more, it will... it will prompt life to return to activity. Isn't that so? The people riding on the bikes have such a happy look. "The people returning from their spring outings: they have brought the colors of spring back to the city!" Silently, smoking a light cigarette, reading poetry... But, in spring, how boring!</p>
<h3>Ode to Spring</h3>
<p>— Chen Zunyuan</p>
<p>Spring has arrived in the human world, as recorded on the flying calendar, it has been here for a long time.</p>
<p>However, where is spring?</p>
<p>Some say spring is "at the tips of the willows," some say "spring is on the pear blossoms," and some say "spring is under the wings of swallows." Where exactly is spring? Here, there are only towering rectangular buildings. There are neither willows nor pear blossoms, nor do wandering swallows gracefully stop. Where can we find spring?</p>
<p>Ah: there is. Spring is hidden in the bodies of women. Look: aren't the women on the street taking off their heavy fur coats, raising their breasts high, and strolling leisurely in their fluttering soft robes? Enough to intoxicate, enough to fascinate, this spring mood, this spring mood on women's bodies.</p>
<p>Spring is worthy of people's praise.</p>
<p>The spring breeze is like playing a melody of love, which will blow away the depression and sorrow in the human world. The spring rain is like the delicious grape wine that nourishes the heart of youth. Every drop will make people feel excited and happy. Spring comes after the harsh winter, and will lead people from the deep cold of the ice and snow to a warm and pleasant climate. All things germinate and grow from this time, and human activities and food also begin to be obtained from this time. The Russian blind poet Eroshchenko said: "In every year, spring is the busiest season. What we sow in spring, we can harvest at harvest time. The luck of the whole year depends on our spring work. Famine, lack, and all other misfortunes of a country are also in spring. The spring in human history is also like this. The spring work of each new era strictly determines the boundaries of the development of the entire era." Spring's connection to the creation and failure of everything is so great!</p>

<p>Sports News</p>
<h3>The Runner-Up Position is Questionable. Yu You Drew with Western Police Yesterday. The First Half Was Two to Two, and Both Sides Did Not Score in the Second Half. Sun Jinshun Missed Good Opportunities Frequently. Neither Side Had Any Highlights.</h3>
<p>There were originally three matches in the Western Union Football League A yesterday. Due to the accident that occurred in Shen Yuan the day before, the match between Donghua and Inness was postponed. Therefore, there were only two matches yesterday, namely Yu You vs. Western Police, and French Merchants vs. Lux, which were held at the first and second fields of Hongkou Park respectively. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Yu You Drew with Western Police</p>
<p>The Yu You football team fought the Western Police team at the first field of Hongkou Park yesterday. The strength of both sides was very even. The first half ended with two to two, and neither side scored in the second half. As a result, they drew with two to two. Yesterday the sun was shining, the wind was gentle and the weather was warm. A very large number of people went to watch, estimated to be more than ten thousand people. The fences around were all collapsed. Fortunately, a large number of police officers were dispatched to the field to maintain order, so the order was well maintained.</p>
<p>The War Drums Urged, Each Scored a Goal</p>
<p>The bell rang three times, and the battle began. The Western Police team took the lead all the way. In less than five minutes, Yu You's Sun Jinshun and Liu Zurong advanced side by side, but were blocked and retreated by Hughes and Moore, two interior defenders. However, from then on, the ball revolved around the Western Police's goal. Liu Shanru saw a good opportunity to dribble straight in, and Hastings was unable to cope. Cheers rang out, and Yu You took the lead with one to zero. The Western Police were not willing to be outdone, so the forwards launched an attack, with Better being brave, Botie showing his power, and Huggins and Utley assisting on the left and right. At this time, there was a crisis in front of Yu You's goal. Soon, Huggins took advantage of a corner kick to sweep the ball in. Although Zhang Rongcai was as strong as an iron gate, it was difficult to defend the territory, so it became a one to one draw.</p>
<p>Each Side Added Goals, and Another Draw Was Achieved</p>
<p>Afterwards, Yu You reorganized its forces and launched a joint attack again. Sun Jinshun led the generals forward, and went straight to the goal with a lightning-fast method. Gibbs and Hayley rescued the dangerous situation. However, the enemy's courage had been chilled. Not long after, Zhong Yongsen grabbed the ball and passed it to Xu Wenkui. Xu took the opportunity to go forward, and without much effort, lightly flicked his foot and the ball went into the net. Amidst the cheers of the crowd, Yu You won again with two to one. In a moment, Huggins launched an attack from the border, penetrating deep into the territory, and rushing to the front of Yu You's goal. The two generals, Lu Jiang, hurriedly tried to go forward, but it was too late, so he took advantage of the situation and entered the territory, making it eleven to eleven. The two teams each added officials and were promoted, and another draw was achieved.</p>
<p>In the Second Half, Everyone Was Polite</p>
<p>At the beginning of the second half, the formations of both sides lacked contact. There were indeed thousands of differences, and they were unwilling to fight because of inaccurate shooting. Everyone was polite, and there was frequent yielding, with no achievements. From 3:55 to 4:45, everyone still ate duck eggs. The referee blew the whistle to end the game, and it ended in a two to two draw.</p>
<p>Yu You Missed Opportunities and Was a Pity</p>
<p>In terms of the skills of the two teams, to be fair, they have not yet reached the pinnacle of perfection. Although the individual performances are still outstanding, the contact of the entire line is lacking in training. Sun Jinshun was unwilling to work hard on this day, which caused frequent loss of good opportunities. Sun repeatedly shot in the first half, but they were all a millimeter away and failed to hit the target. In the second half, Better was fined a twelve-yard penalty. Sun Jinshun took the penalty kick. The general public thought that Western Police would be difficult to escape this disaster, but Sun's kick was not effective. With a broken kick, the ball went over the net. As a result, the game ended in a draw, and the runner-up position became a problem.</p>
<p>Yu You</p>
<p>Zhang Rongcai, Zhi Mingjiang, Shan Jingwang, Zhang Bao, Liang Shutang, Shi Jinsheng, Liu Zurong, Chen Shikai, Sun Jinshun, Xu Wenkui, Zhong Yongsen</p>
<p>Western Police</p>
<p>Hastings, Moore, Hughes, Hayley, Gibbs, Moore, Huggins, Botie, Willey, Better, Utley</p>
<p>Lux Won Against French Merchants</p>
<p>French Merchants and Lux met at the second field in Dingkou yesterday afternoon. The French Merchants' lineup was scattered and its strength was weak. They could not attack and could not defend. As a result, the door was wide open, and Lux was able to do whatever they wanted, winning a big victory over French Merchants with seven to one.</p>
<p>Recent Results of Western Union A</p>
<p>Looking at the recent results of the Western Union Football League A, Yu You ranks first with 21 points. After the incident yesterday, the Western Union does not know how to resolve it. The runner-up position has become a problem. If Blue Yu You had won yesterday, they could have sat in the runner-up position. Now that they have drawn, they still need the runner-up. If they win one and lose one, Yu You can still be the runner-up.</p>

<h3>Zhenru Drew with Fudan in the Middle Character Group of the China Football Association. Fudan Played with Only Ten People. The Result Was a Three to Three Draw.</h3>
<p>Fudan and Jinan University football teams competed in the Middle Character Group of the China Football Association in Zhenru yesterday. The spring sunshine was warm, the wind was gentle, and there were two or three thousand spectators. The lineups of both teams were not complete. Guan Xun'an was absent from Fudan, and they only played with ten people. Xu Heng and Wang Fuzhen were absent from Jinan, and their strength was also reduced. They were evenly matched, and met their opponents. Jinan relied on the contact of the forwards and once took a three to one lead. Later, due to loopholes in the interior defense, Fudan returned two goals, resulting in a three to three draw. The referee was He Chunhui. The situation of the Middle Character Group and the course of the battle yesterday are described separately below:</p>
<p>Team Name | Games Played | Won | Drawn | Lost | Points</p>
<p>---|---|---|---|---|---</p>
<p>Weihua | 4 | 4 | 0 | 0 | 8</p>
<p>Fudan | 5 | 3 | 1 | 1 | 7</p>
<p>Zhenru | 6 | 3 | 1 | 2 | 7</p>
<p>Leji | 7 | 2 | 0 | 5 | 4</p>
<p>Merchant Marine | 6 | 1 | 0 | 5 | 2</p>
<p>The Guest Team Opened the Score</p>
<p>Jinan kicked off, and their momentum was fierce. The young generals charged left and right, and the contact was well-organized. Zhong Yuxiang once shot fiercely, and the horizontal bar bounced back. Shi Yongnan counterattacked the door, rushing into the sky, which was a pity. They continued to pursue, and although there were only four forwards, the offensive was not weak. Yu Shunzhang and Yang Ronghua had strong feet, and the home team was surprised. When the battle reached 20 minutes, Fudan's Xi Ziven got assistance from An Lesheng and copied from the border. Jinan's Chen Chunyan immediately started to defend. Xi passed the ball to Lu Xiuwen, who picked it up and sent it to the front of the door. Yang Ronghua caught up and kicked the ball into Jinan's goal. Clear and beautiful, the record was opened first. Then Fudan's Xi Ziven passed another ball, and the goalkeeper rushed out and missed. Fortunately, Yang Ronghua caught up a little later, otherwise Jinan would have been even more unfavorable.</p>
<p>The Home Team Recovered Two Goals</p>
<p>Jinan's Chen Zhenxiang sat in the center, receiving and assisting, without the slightest slack. The whole army was determined to recover the lost ground. The forwards besieged the guest team's goal, attacking from left and right. Fudan was overwhelmed and could not cope. Finally, Qiu Zhen'an hit a goal from the side, creating a tie. Fudan went deep again, and Gong Ziwen broke into the penalty area. Fortunately, Mai Yanlin was alert and blocked Gong's path. The ball was saved by the goalkeeper. Since then, Jinan's offensive has been very strong. After Zhong Yongxiang's shot missed, Li Shengguan's high ball embarrassed the enemy, and fell directly on the enemy's goal. Fudan goalkeeper Gu Degang caught it, but Cai Jincai and Shi Yongnan rushed into the door. Jinan took a two to one lead. Fudan was 20 yards away from Jinan's goal, and was penalized for two free kicks, but did not benefit.</p>
<p>A Three to One Lead Was Taken</p>
<p>After the first half, Fudan was quite frustrated. After all, the lack of a forward made a difference. The power was weak, and the small passes of the Jinan young generals were very good. The situation became one-sided. Fudan's Zhang Rong was penalized for slapping the ball outside the penalty area. Chen Zhenxiang picked up the high ball and sent it to the door. The two generals Zhong and Shi took the opportunity to catch up. Zhong headed the goal, but was blocked out of the door by Gu Degang. Mai Tinglin was transferred to the left wing, and sent out a corner kick to no avail. The three forwards made a comeback, and Fudan's defender could not take care of it, and another ball was poured in. Three to one, Jinan led the way.</p>
<p>Fudan Tied the Game</p>
<p>Although the Jinan forwards' contact was good, their feet were very soft and they lost many opportunities. In terms of the situation, Fudan was isolated and weak, and development was not easy, but the weather is unpredictable, and the outcome cannot be predicted. And once penetrated deep, struggling for a long time, when the Jinan goalkeeper picked up the ball at the edge of the door and kicked it out, he kicked it on the feet of Yang Ronghua of Fudan in front of him, and Yang unconsciously clocked the ball, and the ball bounced into the door. Unexpectedly won a goal, overjoyed. Jinan could not help but be discouraged. Then, Yu Shunzhang fought alone, breaking into the enemy camp and built another success, forming three to three. Although Jinan made a final struggle, trying to regain the light, but several attacks were bounced back on the goalposts, things did not go as planned, and it was helpless, and the game ended in a draw.</p>

China vs. Russian Overseas Chinese, the first half was one to zero, and there were no wins or losses in the second half. The overall result was one to zero. The Chinese team won and won the championship. The cup has been played in a round for three years. This year, China won, which was unexpected by the general public.</p>
<h3>Shanghai First Sports Stadium, Closing Ceremony of Industrial and Commercial Football</h3>
<p>Group | Team | Win/Loss | Result</p>
<p>---|---|---|---</p>
<p>Setting | South China vs. Zilin | South China wins | 1 to 0</p>
<p>Life | Lianyi vs. Huadian | Lianyi wins | 1 to 0</p>

<p>Live | Yougong vs. Xingtai | Yougong wins | 3 to 2</p>
<p>Life | Maotai vs. Insurance | Maotai wins | 2 to 1</p>
<p>In the base character group's round-robin results, Sanmin and Feigong teams are the best. However, Sanmin got one more point than Feigong. In yesterday's confrontation, the two teams met, and Sanmin immediately drew the game. They can also hold the lead in the group. At 10:30, the soldiers were lined up and the referee was Zhang Le. Sanmin was in the direction of the wind, and his hard work was fruitless, and he had lost a few points of sharpness. In the second half, Feigong took the opportunity to kick a corner kick and scored a goal. Sanmin suffered this setback, and the formation was scattered, and the military's morale was too radical, and there were often excessive movements and behaviors. Fortunately, the referee enforced the law as usual, and no incidents occurred. As a result, Sanmin lost another goal, resulting in a ratio of 0 to 2, and Feigong won the championship of the group. In terms of manpower, Sanmin is average inside and outside, and Feigong's strength is uneven. Therefore, the audience predicted that Sanmin would win and be able to control the situation, but the soldiers lacked training, which disappointed the hard work of those who run the team to promote sports, unfortunately.</p>

<h3>Zhejiang Province Holds Scout Rally</h3>
<p>The fourth Zhejiang Provincial Scout Rally will be held at Wansongling from April 2nd to 4th. About 5,000 people have registered to participate. The General Association sent Feng Ti and others to Hangzhou for inspection. The Central Government sent Zeng Yangfu to participate in the guidance.</p>
<h3>Sichuan Province Strictly Implements Production Education</h3>
<p>(Chongqing, Central News Agency) Liu Xiang held talks with senior officials of the Education Department on the 29th, saying that Sichuan will strictly implement production education in the future, and asked them to draw up a detailed plan to be implemented in July.</p>
<h3>Central China University Experimental School Implements a Flexible System; Graduation from Senior and Junior High School Not Limited to Six Semesters; Exceptional Students Can Graduate in Five Semesters; Students with Lower Aptitude May Require Seven or Eight Semesters</h3>
<p>The Central China University Experimental School is of an experimental nature and differs slightly from ordinary primary and secondary schools. In terms of the academic system, it is given considerable freedom in order to give full play to the spirit of experimentation and fulfill its mission. The school is implementing a flexible system, and the graduation period for senior and junior high school students is not limited to six semesters. Exceptional students can graduate in five semesters, while students with lower aptitude may require seven or eight semesters to graduate, so that those with innate intelligence do not have to waste time, and those with poorer endowments can gradually reach the prescribed level. Under this fairly flexible system, various experimental and testing methods can be applied to realize the spirit of experimental education of the University Education College. The Nanjing Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs checked the results of the school's past two joint entrance examinations, which were always ranked first, indicating that there are no drawbacks to giving this kind of freedom to extend or shorten the length of study to a school with the purpose of experimentation. The bureau has submitted a report to the Ministry of Education for approval, and the Ministry has instructed the Bureau of Social Affairs to forward the information to the school for notification.</p>
<h3>The Pros and Cons of Phonetic Script and Chinese Characters; Li Jinxi Expresses Four Opinions; Explanations Regarding Wasting Time and Eyestrain; Agrees That Research Should Be Conducted First</h3>
<p>(Beiping Correspondence) Recently, a Shanghai newspaper published Chen Heqin's views on phonetic script and Chinese characters, stating that Li Jinxi's proposal to use phonetic script and Chinese characters for all popular reading materials and elementary school textbooks may have three drawbacks. A Shanghai reporter visited Li to inquire about his opinion, which he shared as follows:</p>
<p>Does Not Waste Time</p>
<p>(1) Wasting Time: Phonetic script and Chinese characters were originally intended to save time. Chen believes that phonetic transcription of unfamiliar characters is necessary, and phonetic transcription of familiar characters also serves as a reminder. When the public and children read, if the characters are indeed familiar and not forgotten, they will naturally not look at the phonetic symbols again, so how could it waste time? If they accidentally forget the pronunciation, they can recognize the character by looking at the phonetic symbol next to it, saving the time of checking and asking. As for the concern that it will confuse vision and distract attention during teaching, there is no need to worry, because phonetic transcription is a symbol for recognizing characters, just like punctuation marks, and it does not involve mixing in other things.</p>
<p>Does Not Cause Eyestrain</p>
<p>(2) Eyestrain: This is a matter of the font size of textbooks. If the font is too small, it will cause eyestrain even without phonetic transcription. Moreover, for characters that have been learned and not forgotten, readers do not need to look closely at the phonetic symbols for each character. If it is said that adding phonetic symbols easily causes the danger of myopia, then all Japanese people who read the Asahi Shimbun every day would become nearsighted. This is because ordinary Japanese newspapers, even with font sizes as small as size six Chinese characters, all have Kana (phonetic symbols) written beside them, precisely to facilitate reading for the public and children.</p>
<p>Not Prone to Errors</p>
<p>(3) Prone to Errors: This point seems even less of a concern. The fact that young children easily mistake phonetic symbols as an integral part of the text is a matter that should be paid attention to in teaching. Moreover, the reason for errors lies precisely in the lack of clear and accurate font types for phonetic script and Chinese characters. In the future, when uniform phonetic transcription is used, with the characters in the middle and the phonetic symbols on the right, with clear lines and a distinct relationship between the main body and the adjunct, it will be possible to eliminate the chance of errors that occurred in the past when phonetic transcription was occasional and the font was poor.</p>
<p>Conduct Research</p>
<p>(4) Research Should Be Conducted First: I (Li refers to himself) also agree with this point. However, this kind of experiment must have its tools first, that is, it must print a large number of phonetic script and Chinese character reading materials, and it cannot be researched in words alone. Therefore, it must be implemented before there can be results, as the saying goes, "If you don't do it, you can't say you know it." But if it is resolutely implemented at this time, even if there is "little benefit," it will definitely not be "harmful."</p>

<h3>Municipal Education Bureau Sends Letter to Court to Arrest Liu Dairuo, Principal of Nanyang Senior Commercial School; Liu Manages Poorly, Absconds with Funds</h3>
<p>(Central News Agency) The private Nanyang Senior Commercial High School on Haige Road, West Shanghai, has been operating for many years, and its performance is considered not bad. Since Liu Dairuo became the acting principal, the management has been poor, and there have been repeated incidents. This time, a dispute arose, and Principal Liu was unable to resolve it.

It is reported that the Municipal Education Bureau has sent a letter to various courts to strictly arrest him as a warning to others and to rectify the school's ethos. Nanyang Senior Commercial School sent a letter yesterday stating: Respectfully, the news about Jiangxi Vocational Middle School in your newspaper the day before yesterday, which is related to Nanyang Senior Commercial School, is inconsistent with the facts. Since internal disputes occurred in our school, we have requested the education authorities to find a way to resolve the current board of directors. The board of directors has been reorganized and is ready, and a new principal will be produced soon. Classes will be resumed in the near future. Fearing that people from all walks of life do not understand the truth and are confused, we urge your newspaper to correct the record. Sincerely, Nanyang Commercial School's Expel Principal and Protect School Committee, 30th.</p>

The other day, the German entrepreneur Walter Wolff visited the school and praised it greatly, saying that the level of the students is comparable to that of German universities, and generously attached 20,000 marks to the school for the purchase of physics and chemistry equipment. In addition, many of the school's professors are German, and they teach mostly in German. Recruiting students every year (is quite difficult. In order to increase the source of new students, last year they cooperated with Hangzhou Provincial High School to set up a German class. This year, they have agreed to cooperate with Yangzhou Middle School, Jiangsu Province. Zhou Fohai, Director of the Jiangsu Education Department, strongly supports this, and has stipulated that the provincial government will subsidize 3,000 yuan in 1935 for the employment of German teachers. The cooperation contract has been negotiated and finalized by Zhou Houzhao, the principal of Yangzhou Middle School, and the school. Yangzhou Middle School will be able to recruit German class students after the summer vacation.</p>

<h3>The Decline of Native Banks and Their Future (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Wu Xiaochen</p>
<p>Though stated this way, the contraction of credit is just an extremely broad and vague statement, merely a consequence, not a cause. We must, of course, seek the factors that formed this contraction. The crisis of the native banking industry’s decline is so significant that we cannot simply gloss over it with such a superficial explanation. Let us now engage in further investigation:</p>
<p>Since the transition from the barter era to the era of metallic currency exchange, significant changes have occurred in the organization of the social economy, and the methods of borrowing have also been developed. Business enterprises have gradually expanded with the evolution of the times, and the use of funds has also increased in line with the expansion of business. However, a suitable connection must be established between these two, so that they can mutually benefit in lending relationships. We must recognize that there are many members of the bourgeoisie who possess vast amounts of capital but do not engage in business, while at the same time, there are entrepreneurs who desire to plan ventures but are constrained by a lack of capital to expand their plans. Capitalists are not necessarily entrepreneurs, and entrepreneurs are even less likely to be capitalists. The emergence of native banks is to remedy this deficiency, serving as a medium for circulating capital, enabling capitalists and entrepreneurs to establish indirect connections through the assistance of native banks. In other words, native banks, having gained social trust, absorb funds from society using their own credit, and then assess the creditworthiness of customers to provide corresponding loans. As for the business of native banks, there are of course items such as remittances and discounting, but everyone knows that their biggest goal is to find profits in the interest rate differential between deposits and loans!</p>
<p>Native banks maintain their power to facilitate social finance by profiting from the difference between high and low interest rates on deposits and loans. We must understand that these profits come from those who accept loans from native banks. Since the lending of native banks is mainly focused on industry and commerce, industry and commerce are the true source of vitality for native banks, and it can even be said that native banks are a parasitic distribution organization dependent on industry and commerce. To put it more bluntly, they are a disguised version of the house in a gambling den that sits and divides the spoils. Therefore, if native banks want to be healthy themselves, they must first desire the prosperity of industry and commerce. However, everything in industry and commerce is controlled by the countryside. Since the production and consumption of the countryside are relative, the more the production capacity increases, the greater the development of industry and commerce, and the relationship between them is very close. We can now quote Li Qufei’s writing style from "Notes After Reading the Records of Famous Gardens in Luoyang" and say a general statement: "The rise and fall of native banks can be known by observing the prosperity and decline of industry and commerce; the prosperity and decline of industry and commerce can be obtained by observing the prosperity and desolation of the countryside."</p>
<p>Having been subjected to the economic aggression of imperialism and then repeatedly exploited at various levels, the Chinese countryside has gradually declined in recent years and is heading towards bankruptcy, a fact that is widely known, so there is no need to waste space here. However, after the countryside declines, industry and commerce, which share the same fate, are like a group of defeated soldiers with no way forward and pursuers behind them, about to disintegrate! Native banks happen to be standing at the forefront of the battle line. Not only is the center of gravity of their business severely attacked, but under the clear instruction of the ancient adage that "only after having enough to eat does one know etiquette," industry and commerce, which are beyond salvation, are settling accounts today and closing down tomorrow, causing utter chaos. The reputation that was once guarded so cautiously, fearing even the slightest negligence, like a person's second life, cannot be maintained even if one wishes to. As a result, it goes without saying that industry and commerce often cannot pay the interest due to native banks, and even the repayment of loans is extremely difficult. However, native banks cannot tolerate the slightest delay or postponement in payments to depositors who provide funds. As a result, native banks, caught in an absolute contradiction, are at their wit's end, wishing neither to live nor to die. Following the bankruptcy of the countryside and industry and commerce, the cry of the bankruptcy of the human spirit is also rising rapidly. Therefore, I say that the decline of native banks stems from a general contraction of credit; however, the reason for the general contraction of credit is actually due to the bankruptcy of the countryside and industry and commerce!</p>
<p>Since the main source of the decline of native banks lies in the countryside, the native banks in the interior, being closer to the countryside, are declining earlier and more severely than the native banks in the treaty ports. For example, the native banks in the silk-producing areas were already beyond recovery three years ago. However, the native banks in treaty ports such as Shanghai, Tianjin, and Xiamen have only recently been unable to conceal their weaknesses in the past one or two years. This is because, after the general contraction of credit, funds from the interior have been continuously concentrated in the cities, and the native banks in the treaty ports have benefited from a last burst of glory—in fact, the power of native banks is no match for banks, and the profits are very small—so they have persisted for a year or two longer.</p>
<p>In Wuxing, Changzhou, and Xuzhou, only one native bank was left barely surviving in each place, while in Anqing, Jiaxing, Haiyan, and other places, all the native banks were closed down. However, we must know that not all the dozens of native banks in Wuxing and other places were unable to survive; there were good and bad ones among them, and they cannot be treated equally. However, after the general contraction of credit, one hair can move the whole body. Society's trust in the entire native banking industry in a certain place is completely questioned due to the bankruptcy of a certain native bank in that place. Is this not extremely dangerous? Therefore, many native banks whose receipts and payments could be offset were forced to close down because they could not cope with the runs on deposits. The native banking industry under such circumstances has great difficulty in moving, especially the native banks in the interior, because raising funds is much more difficult than in the treaty ports. Therefore, under objective conditions, native banks in the interior also find it difficult to gain the trust of others. The flow of funds has gradually lost its past control ability, and funds from the interior have also concentrated in the cities like rivers flowing into the sea. In this way, the more funds dry up in the interior, the more inflexible the financial turnover becomes, and the native banking industry, which is completely defeated, suffers deeply. However, the rural economy is rapidly bankrupt due to the lack of funds, becoming the current ailment in China's core.</p>
<p>III</p>
<p>The current decline of native banks is certainly not the first time they have faced difficulties. In the past, during the Sino-French War and the rubber stock speculation craze, the native banking industry also suffered harm. During the Xinhai Revolution, the overall situation was precarious, and frequent alarms were raised, and the native banking industry felt particularly endangered. Although the scene of decline was not as widespread as it is today, the degree of panic was no less than today. However, the past declines were only temporary or localized injuries, like suffering a mild cold. Although the onset of chills and fever was very fierce, if there was an opportunity to recuperate, it would not be difficult to restore the original health. Therefore, although the native banks declined in the past, they were able to revive shortly after. The current situation cannot be compared with the past. The severity of the illness is no longer a mild cold, but has turned into chronic pneumonia. Therefore, judging the future of the native banking industry based on the current special environment, I am afraid no one would dare to be optimistic!</p>
<p>Moreover, after the general contraction of credit, the basis for the native banking industry's credit lending has been fundamentally shaken. The legal remedies are also extremely vague. On the other hand, the banking power that advocates mortgage lending is also expanding abnormally, indirectly posing a serious threat to the native banking industry. For example, the goods obtained by the industrial and commercial sectors after borrowing from native banks can be mortgaged to banks, invisibly depriving the native banks of the guarantee of goods and relying only on credit. Therefore, in the spring of 1932, the Hangzhou Weicheng Silk Weaving Factory was forced to close down because it could not repay its debts to the Bank of China, causing the Weikang Native Bank in Hangzhou, which had a high reputation, to declare liquidation after Weicheng because it had provided a large amount of credit lending, and the principal and interest were nowhere to be found after the factory closed down.</p>
<p>The native banking industry, like a startled bird, in such difficult and dangerous years, certainly cannot stick to its old ways. For the sake of society and for its own sake, how should it change its course so as not to be eliminated by the times? Therefore, the native banks in Shanghai have made major changes to their business policies this year, and the main purpose of the changes is to contract lending, so some account books have not yet been distributed. In fact, the native banks in the interior had already been operating according to this principle two or three years ago. Under the circumstances of exhaustion, they could not help but adopt a tight policy in the hope of surviving. The decline of native banks in Shanghai was later, so they have only now launched the initiative to improve their business. However, after this transformation, there is no doubt that social finance will be further stagnated. Is this a perfect plan? Otherwise, if the native banks in the interior had already been wary two or three years ago, why are they still at a loss now? And why has the interior, from the countryside to industry and commerce, become even more desolate? There are rumors in Shanghai that a few native banks are preparing to sit and spend their capital by paying expenses and discounting interest, implementing a cessation of lending, and waiting for the market to turn around before resuming operations. This is also a discussion of abandoning the root and pursuing the branches. One must know that with limited capital, how can one supply unlimited consumption? As a result, waiting for the hare to hit the tree stump, one will sit and eat the mountain empty. I am afraid that the market may not recover as the native banks hope, and the native banks may have already exhausted their resources before the market recovers.</p>
<p>Since the native banking industry is parasitic on industry and commerce, the decline of the native banking industry is not only its own problem. Therefore, the future of the native banking industry can hardly be separated from industry and commerce to create its own path. The way to remedy this in the future lies not only in self-awareness and the reform of internal organization, and the concentration of manpower and financial resources. The most important thing is to help the recovery of industry and commerce; however, to seek the recovery of industry and commerce, one must first cure the countryside, which is as sick as a mountain. Regarding the salvation of the countryside, the first thing is to make the rural economy active. Only after the rural economy is active can the rural production capacity be restored. Therefore, it can increase the purchasing power of the general public to encourage the prosperity of industry and commerce, and use the prosperity of industry and commerce to develop the native banking industry's lending to industry and commerce. Because of this, I feel that the measures changed by the native banking industry after the failure are counterproductive, and they are destroying their own path to survival. Therefore, this tight policy has very little chance of being supported for a long time. If you are determined to persevere, it is tantamount to digging your own grave!</p>
<p>However, to reiterate, with the limited power of the native banking industry, it is impossible to put the rural economy on the path to vitality. Even the rural investment that the banking industry is advocating now is also a fallacy. Therefore, some people say: "It is true that the countryside now urgently needs funds, but unless the reasons for the continuous outflow of funds from the countryside and the conditions under which funds cannot return to the countryside are changed, funds will not return to the countryside in large quantities. Even if a little bit is artificially flowed back, it is very questionable whether it will benefit the bankrupt countryside and whether it will truly fall on the farmers." (New China, Volume 2, Issue 1, Page 108) It can be seen that the prerequisite for making the rural economy active is to prevent rural agricultural capital from escaping to the treaty ports to build foreign-style houses. The reason why rural funds flow out is mostly because the native banks in the interior have lost their control ability. The reason why the native banking industry cannot control is because of the general contraction of credit. The reason for the contraction of credit is because of the plummeting of industry and commerce. The reason for the plummeting of industry and commerce is because the phenomenon of rural bankruptcy is becoming more obvious. This is a series of interconnected causes and effects. Therefore, although the responsibility for saving the countryside cannot be borne by the weak native banks, due to their close relationship, at this moment when the whole country is working together to revive the countryside, the native banking industry should do its best to improve the environment within its ability, and then there will be a ray of hope. If one is solely focused on tightening and sitting and eating as a good plan, then the future of the native banking industry is not something we want to talk about. (The End)</p>
<h3>A Discussion on the High and Low of Bank Deposit Interest Rates</h3>
<p>— Li Junsi</p>
<p>In recent years, the increase in bank interest rates has become a generally well-known fact. Annual interest rates of around 10% for fixed deposits are now commonplace, and weekly interest rates of 0.4% to 0.5% for current savings are not surprising. However, the increase in bank interest rates has a very negative impact on the economy and society, so knowledgeable people are all worried about this, and it has even attracted the government's attention, which shows the importance of this issue. However, if we want to discuss the level of bank interest rates, we must first understand what interest rates are. Interest rates are based on interest, so let's start with interest.</p>
<p>Anyone with a little economic knowledge knows that if someone can freely control the 1,000 silver dollars he owns, then he has the power to turn that 1,000 dollars into more than 1,000 dollars. But if he is just a monetary capitalist and cannot properly manage this 1,000 dollars, he lends it to entrepreneur B for a period of one year. When B accepts this 1,000 dollars, he uses it as capital in production. After one year, B can probably earn more than 100 dollars in profit, and the capital will increase to more than 1,100 dollars. Then, B adds a portion of that 100 dollars or so to the original 1,000 dollars and returns it to the original owner. This amount is what we call interest.</p>
<p>From this, we can see that interest is the remuneration or price for the use of funds. The portion of the 100 dollars or so that B pays to A is the reward for using the 1,000 dollars. However, this is only a part of what B earns, and it will never exceed all of B's earnings. Because if A's income from the use of funds is equal to all the profits that B makes from using the funds, then B's efforts would be wasted and he would gain nothing. Therefore, interest is never lower than a portion of the profit. However, I firmly believe that if B's use of this 1,000 dollars is successful, and it increases to 1,500 dollars or more, then A's interest income will also increase relatively. But in reality, if this 1,000 dollars is used in legitimate production, it will not generate such a large profit. If you must obtain such a huge profit, then you must invest it in illegitimate production, or change the investment into speculation. Although this kind of investment yields high profits, the risk is extremely high, and there is always the possibility of losing the principal. So we can say that the more profitable a business is, the greater the risk it contains.</p>
<p>Originally, the level of interest, like the price of goods in the market, is completely regulated by the supply and demand of capital. If the need for capital is urgent, interest will naturally be high; otherwise, it will be low. The difference is that the price of goods, under normal circumstances, must include cost plus profit to avoid losses, while capital is not like that. Under this principle, we are reminded of the past bankruptcy of the rural economy, the concentration of funds in urban areas, and the situation created in Shanghai in the process. However, at that time, the banks in Shanghai not only did not reduce the interest on deposits to adapt to the surplus of funds, but many banks were competing to attract funds by touting generous interest rates. Although there is a different background for the destination of funds in this abnormal state, we can also see that the banking industry has no regulatory function for the surplus or lack of funds, and is developing entirely under abnormal conditions.</p>
<p>The above is all about interest. As for the interest rate, it is the ratio of the interest earned on borrowed funds within a certain period to the total amount of capital.</p>
<p>II</p>
<p>Now that we have understood that the interest rate is the ratio of interest to capital, and that interest is the reward for using funds, let's see how much compensation the banks are paying for the use of capital, or in other words, how much desire the banks have for entrepreneurs who need funds.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, bank interest rates can be roughly divided into deposit interest rates and lending interest rates. In European and American banks, deposit interest rates are mostly not valued. On the public side, depositing money in banks does not haggle over the high or low interest rates. Therefore, most banks only act as cashiers for current accounts and do not pay interest. Perhaps a few banks also give interest, but we dare to determine that it is extremely small. Although lending interest rates are relatively valued, since the outbreak of the world economic panic in 1929, prices have fallen, production has been stagnant, and bankers have reduced the burden on industrialists, so the world's bank interest rates have shown a clear downward trend. The outbreak of the world economic panic was not without impact on our country. Under the fierce dumping of foreign goods, our country's economic lifeline has been fundamentally shaken; in addition, the decline of the domestic rural economy has become increasingly serious, resulting in industrial and commercial depression and market depression. In theory, under the pressure of such a serious environment, bank interest rates should also have a downward trend; but what we see is that bank interest rates not only do not have the slightest downward trend, but instead have a increasing phenomenon with the deepening of the degree of panic. This development is most prominent in the last two years. When small banks were established one after another like bamboo shoots after rain, interest rates gradually increased; although the attitude of large banks was cautious, the interest rates on fixed deposits were mostly as high as 8% or 9%. It can be seen that the increase in interest rates on deposits in banks has become a general trend. I remember that on October 11 last year, the China Industrial Bank went bankrupt due to losses from the organization of the International Racing Club. Later, the responsible personnel were successively arrested. During the trial in the First Special District Court, the president of the court accused them of fraudulently obtaining deposits with high interest rates. The defendant's lawyer presented evidence to defend, saying that the defendant was not the only one with weekly interest rates of more than 1%. We can undoubtedly admit that the defense of this defendant's lawyer is true. This is because the phenomenon of bank deposit interest rates exceeding 1% has become common. Here we can easily point out a few to serve as evidence. One bank stipulates that the interest rate for fixed deposits is 6% for three months, 7% for six months, 8% for nine months, 10% for one year, 11% for two years, and as high as 11% for three years. The interest rate for current deposits is also extraordinarily high, with an annual interest rate of 5% for deposits held for six months, 7% for deposits held for one year, 8% for deposits held for one and a half years, and 9% for deposits held for two years. There are even higher rates, such as fixed deposits of 7.5% for six months, 9% for one year, 9.5% for two years, 10% for three years, 10.5% for four years, and 11% for five years (according to an advertisement, there is even 13.5%); current deposits range from 5% to 7%. In addition, there is a special savings deposit that "obtains the convenience of current withdrawal and enjoys the generous interest of fixed deposits," with interest rates also above 10%. Such high interest rates are truly somewhat unexpected and shocking. But according to newspaper reports, in addition to enjoying such high interest rates, depositors can also receive exquisite gifts from the bank when opening an account. From this, we can see how devoted the banks are to obtaining funds. But we should note that what is cited here is only a small part of what we can see. There are many other banks that may have even higher interest rates in this battle for funds!</p>
<p>Under this situation, what we need to analyze is why the banks' interest rates on deposits are so increasing? First: it is due to the development of social psychology. According to the social situation in our country, when someone wants to deposit his funds in a bank, he does not ask whether the bank's credit is good or whether the use of funds is legitimate, but first looks at the bank's deposit regulations and how much interest it can give. Under this environment, if banks want to obtain funds, they have to increase interest rates to cater to social psychology. Second: there are many small banks. The scale of these banks is not large, and some of them are reorganized from money shops. Their capital is mostly 500,000 to 1 million. With such small capital, their power is very weak and cannot compete with large banks in the financial market. Therefore, they retreat to engage in the competition for funds. And the increase in deposit interest rates has become the only tool to seize funds.</p>
<p>It is obvious that banks give such generous interest on deposits, but although banks are in the position of debtors to depositors, they stand in the position of creditors to industrialists who need capital; in other words, banks entrust the payment of generous interest to industrialists who need funds by way of transfer. Not only that, but the banks themselves are not fulfilling their obligations, so the banks also want to embezzle the remaining profits from the difference between the deposit interest rate and the lending interest rate—the remaining part of the general profit after deducting interest. For this reason, industrialists who need funds must not only bear the generous interest paid by the bank to depositors, but also bear the bank's business profits—the surplus of general profits after deducting interest. But in the face of this depressed industrial and commercial situation, do industrialists have the ability to bear such a heavy burden? Undoubtedly, this is the question.</p>
<p>III</p>
<p>The increase in bank interest rates, even reaching more than 10%, we see that in the past, when industry and commerce were developed, it was rare to see legitimate industries that could earn more than 10%; in this current stage of industrial and commercial depression, it is of course even rarer for legitimate industries to be able to earn 10%. Therefore, such high interest rates from banks are definitely not something that the current industry can bear. At the same time, the resulting malpractices not only cause great harm to the entire society, but also lead to an unavoidable crisis for the banks themselves. This is such a serious event!</p>
<p>Now let us describe in detail the disadvantages of banks raising interest rates: (1) For legitimate industries: (A) Indirectly create a state of separation between financial capital and industrial capital, making it impossible for legitimate industries to develop. As mentioned earlier, the profits of legitimate production businesses are limited, and they cannot satisfy the greedy desires of bankers. Therefore, it is difficult for banks to lend money to industrialists. However, every industry needs huge amounts of capital to turn over from manufacturing to sales, which is an indispensable condition. Now that bankers cannot lend money to industrialists because of the disparity in interest rates, it is impossible for legitimate industries to develop, and even those that have developed are at risk of gradually withering due to lack of capital irrigation. (B) Directly increase the cost of industry, making it impossible for goods to compete in the market. Of course, the facts cannot be swept away in one go. There are still many industries that accept loans from banks. However, the result of accepting high-interest loans from banks only increases the cost of the industry. Take the textile industry as an example: yarn is produced in large quantities and requires huge amounts of capital. From manufacturing to late sales, it takes a considerable amount of time. The interest on capital during this period is an element in calculating costs. The level of interest rates is enough to dominate the rise and fall of the business. Ordinary manufacturers of 10-count cotton yarn have to bear 13 to 15 yuan of interest per package, which is worlds apart compared to Japanese cotton yarn, which is subsidized by the government or other agencies. Under this circumstance, no matter how much Chinese yarn factories struggle, it will be difficult to compete with Japanese merchants. The same is true for other so-called national industries." (New China, Volume 3, Issue 1) Therefore, some factories are often eager to obtain funds on the one hand, and suffer from the high interest rates of domestic banks on the other hand. Out of helplessness, they have to beg neighboring foreign banks. The Shenxin No. 7 Factory, which was recently auctioned by HSBC, is one example. This situation really makes the industry feel a little dumbfounded. (2) For the entire society: (A) Investing in real estate makes the lives of ordinary people difficult. The profits from bank investment in real estate are far higher than those from lending to the industry. Banks are all eager to invest in real estate. The origin of this trend is that the rural areas went bankrupt and inland funds were concentrated in Shanghai and hid in banks. Banks felt it difficult to invest and felt that there was a surplus of funds, so they gradually invested in real estate, and were able to make a profit for a while. Under this situation, the bank continued to invest in real estate, and at the same time raised the deposit interest rate to attract funds. However, after the banking industry invested in real estate in Shanghai, land prices rose day by day, and rents became more and more expensive. One-third of the income of ordinary people has to be supplied to landlords, so the lives of ordinary people are also affected by indirect influence and are difficult. (B) Make people who own funds unwilling to start a business. People who own funds see that banks give such high interest rates, and most of them deposit their funds in banks and feel at ease to enjoy the interest, and no longer engage in business investment; this is a serious loss for both the country and the society. (3) For the banks themselves: That is, the bank's business tends to speculate, so as to cope with high interest rates on the one hand, and to obtain more profits on the other hand. However, as mentioned earlier, speculative businesses are extremely risky. Depositors may lose all their principal at any time, and bank officials may face the danger of bankruptcy at any time. In the past, there have been many banks that went bankrupt due to failure in speculative businesses, such as China and Yeyin Bank, which is a suitable example.</p>
<p>From the above, raising interest rates by banks really has hundreds of disadvantages and no advantages. If we must propose that raising interest rates by banks is beneficial to society and defend bankers, then the only thing we can say is that it promotes savings and cultivates the people's habit of thrift. On this point, we also admit that raising interest rates by banks can indeed attract a large amount of funds, making the people devote their surplus funds to savings. But is the bank's use of this fund correct? Is it invested in a business that benefits the country and society? If bankers can report this truthfully, I am afraid that some of them will not be able to justify themselves!</p>
<p>IV</p>
<p>In summary, bank interest rates really need to be quickly corrected. We see that the main uses of funds absorbed by banks at high interest rates, in addition to real estate investment, are also the buying and selling of public bonds. Buying and selling public bonds; buying near-term and selling far-term, the so-called "arbitrage," can earn more than 10% interest. However, the price of the public bond market has gradually risen after being traded in large quantities by the banking industry, and the market price is on average above 70% of the face value. With the price of bonds rising four times, banks can no longer arbitrage, so this road is about to be blocked. At the same time, the same is true for real estate: since the depression of industry and commerce and the depression of the market in Shanghai, shops have closed one after another, empty houses have increased day by day, and land prices have been declining, so real estate investment has also reached a dead end. After losing these two major ways to make money, there is no business that can generate such high profits, so many banks have changed their policies and are turning to lending in rural areas, but the profits from lending in rural areas will definitely not be as high as operating real estate public bonds. Therefore, the banks will inevitably fall into a day when they cannot cope with the interest rates they have raised, and they have to secretly think of ways to maintain their external credibility.</p>
<p>We know that the reason why bank lending rates are so high is based on the huge expenditure of deposit interest rates: therefore, if we want to reduce lending rates, we must first reduce deposit rates. But if we want to reduce deposit rates, it would be best if banks can automatically reduce them. Otherwise, the government and the public must work together to achieve results. According to my personal opinion, I think it should be: (1) Stipulate the maximum limit of deposit interest rates—after this limit is stipulated, no matter which bank it is, its maximum deposit interest rate must not exceed this limit. The stipulation of this limit must be made by the government, because most of the small banks in our country do not join the Banking Association, so the power of the Banking Association is actually limited. However, after the government stipulates it, the government will stand in the position of supervision. If a high interest rate exceeding this standard appears, the government can exercise its power and strictly crack down on it. This method seems to be better than publicly setting interest rates. Because publicly setting interest rates has been effective in Japan, but in our country, it may not be suitable before the organization of the association is sound; moreover, after the bank interest rate is publicly set, it cannot be adjusted completely according to whether funds are needed or not, and it is inevitable that it will be rigid. Therefore, it is better to stipulate its maximum limit. Of course, this maximum limit is neither too high nor too low, and it is completely in line with our country's economic situation. (2) Make the people understand the disadvantages of banks absorbing deposits at high interest rates. If the people can fully understand the disadvantages of banks attracting deposits at high interest rates, and know that banks are using their funds for speculative businesses, and there is a risk of losing all of them, they will definitely not want to deposit their funds in high-interest banks again, but would rather deposit them in banks with trustworthy credit. In this way, even if small banks secretly raise interest rates to attract funds, people will not be willing to try. Therefore, the people's own awareness is also a point that cannot be ignored.</p>
<p>However, what we should be concerned about is that in our country, where the economic and social structure is unsound, the banks may cause the risk of funds flowing into foreign banks once they reduce deposit interest rates. We know that in the past, and now, there is a big difference in interest rates between foreign banks and domestic banks. Not only will there never be any funds transferred to foreign banks now, but even if bank deposit interest rates are reduced to a considerable extent in the future, it will not cause the exodus of funds. However, recently, a certain foreign bank, because of the implementation of the US silver policy in the past, the price of silver overseas has soared, so foreign banks have tried their best to transport and sell their silver deposits to make huge profits. Under this sale, a state of empty silver deposits occurred. Therefore, foreign banks are preparing to absorb cash and issue more banknotes to replenish their silver deposits. The method they use to absorb cash is to raise deposit interest rates, so that the deposits of our country's banks are transferred to their own banks. Therefore, this is a matter that should be ashamed of in the process of banks reducing interest rates.</p>

<h3>Quiet Sunday Foreign Exchange Market; Call Loan Rate Still Opens at 10%; Copper Coins Fall by 1,500</h3>
<p>Yesterday was Sunday, a bank holiday. Therefore, although it was the end of the month and a large payment period, the market situation was unusually quiet. The call loan rate was 10% in both the morning and afternoon markets, with no change from the previous day. In the call loan market, over 3.5 million yuan were transferred and traded in the morning, with over 400,000 yuan in new transactions. There was no activity in the afternoon market. The small general association traded over 1.1 million yuan. Over 300,000 yuan were redeemed in the foreign exchange mortgage market, with no new transactions. There was no return of banknotes. Only the issuance side showed over 500,000 yuan in circulating notes and over 600,000 yuan in coded notes. The Qianzhuang foreign exchange public orders collected and resolved over 5.5 million yuan. Remittances from various routes amounted to over 300,000 yuan, and sources from the passenger route were 200,000 yuan. There was no news on the stomach side. As for the division and resolution aspects, the bank was closed due to the holiday, and changes were completely halted. The auxiliary coin situation was also the same as in the previous market. It is estimated that both the morning and afternoon markets for Jiangnan small foreign coins were still 837 yuan, the same as the previous day. There were 1,000 jiao of transactions in the morning market, and none in the afternoon market. Guangdong small foreign coins were slightly better by 2 jiao in the morning market, opening at 734.2 jiao. The afternoon market rose sharply by 4 jiao to 734.6 jiao. As a result, it only rose slightly by 6 jiao compared to the previous day. There were 190,000 jiao of transactions in the morning market and 75,000 jiao in the afternoon market. However, the copper coin situation has turned unfavorable. Both the morning and afternoon markets were 335,000 wen, a drop of 1,500 wen compared to the previous day. The transaction volume was 31,825 strings of wen, worth 9,500 yuan in foreign currency.</p>

<h3>Securities: Bond Market Hovered Upward Last Week</h3>
<p>Last week, from March 25th to 30th, at the Chinese Securities Exchange, it was the transition period between the end of the March futures and the beginning of the May futures. The trading volume was inherently light, and due to settlement reasons, the market was closed for one day, making trading even quieter. However, the environment showed significant changes. Since the increase in capital of the Central Bank, Bank of Communications, and Bank of China with the 100 million gold supplementary public bonds, and with the change of authorities, the government has shown the determination to control finance. Based on this, it is speculated that the second step of nationalizing silver is very likely to be effective. The so-called financial exhaustion and commercial depression can easily rely on this to restore prosperity. The gold pound bonds advocated by Sir Sassoon can coexist without hindering our inherent silver standard. Sino-Japanese amity is not opposed by any country, and the Southwest's advocacy is similar. Based on this speculation, from international amity to economic cooperation, and even the reorganization of old Japanese debts, the somewhat hopeful reorganization of the "96 Public Bonds" is within reach. The recent rumors in the market that the "96 Public Bonds" would not be reorganized, or even no longer be auctioned in the market, are either hypersensitive or fabricated propaganda. Although the "96 Public Bonds" still do not repay principal or pay interest, the government has never denied them. Even the new reorganization plan after the January 28th Incident, which reduced interest and extended the repayment period for various bonds, did not exclude the "96 Public Bonds". When the government's economic power is abundant, it may share the benefits of the reorganization of the Japanese gold portion. This is because the financial sector, which has close ties with the government, holds a large portion of these bonds. Based on speculation about the environmental situation, the bond market has the potential to hover upward. Last week, Monday was the last day for March futures. The baseless rumors about the "96 Public Bonds" only caused a small drop of three to five cents, while other bonds were in a short squeeze situation. Gold Short-Term Treasury Bonds rose seven cents, and others also rose by three to five cents. On Tuesday and Wednesday, only one month of April futures was traded, with initial highs and subsequent lows, and very little squeeze. Thursday was a market closure for the March futures settlement. On Friday, with good environmental news, May futures began trading with enthusiasm. Swap and arbitrage transactions were quite active, rising by three to six cents. On Saturday, swap transactions were still lively, and the market was firm and stable. The future trend is that the two types of bonds, "22 Customs" and "23 Customs", are difficult to boost due to large accounts delivering too much during the March settlement. However, due to urgent needs, there is hope for a gradual rise in other types of bonds. In summary, the results of the weekly market prices: March futures have no market, May futures are newly launched and not counted, and April futures have mostly risen by several cents to over one yuan. The total transaction volume was 49,576,000 yuan. Among them, March futures only traded for one day, but still had 9,330,000 yuan. The results of the rises and falls are compared in the table on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan):</p>

<h3>Sugar Market: The Quantity of Sugar Stored Locally is Not Abundant</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market was unsettled because customs duties would not be increased today. There were few transactions in all goods. However, it was found that the city's inventory was not large, and the supply for this month was indeed reduced. The market is unlikely to be too loose in the future. The survey of the current sugar reserves in the city is recorded as follows (as of March 30):</p>

<h3>Report on the Medical and Health Conditions of Two Towns</h3>
<p>— Song Zhongyu</p>
<p>At the beginning of last month, I went to Baozhen Town, which belongs to Zhenjiang County, for a consultation at the invitation of a friend. I also took the opportunity to thoroughly investigate the medical conditions in the town. While in Baozhen, I was invited by a friend to Chenfuzhuang Town, which belongs to Jurong County, for a consultation. I also investigated the medical conditions in Chenfuzhuang Town. Now, I will make a detailed report on the medical conditions of the two towns, which will show the lack of specialized medical personnel in the townships. I will first talk about Baozhen Town. The town has about 2,000 households, with a population of about 6,000 to 7,000. There are six Chinese medicine stores of various sizes. Each store has a resident doctor, provided with room and board by the store. The consultation fee, regardless of the amount, belongs to the doctor, who only sells medicine at the store. Only one person, surnamed Pan, has a practice at his own home. Doctors, whether at home or in the store, charge one yuan for house calls, and the consultation fee at the clinic is discretionary. I also went to North Street to visit a new medical clinic. The doctor, surnamed Bai, is a trainee from a certain hospital in Zhenjiang for more than three years. Although this gentleman is young, he is very amiable and has more experience than the quack Western doctors. I had a detailed conversation with him. According to him, the locals still trust new medicine. The most common are surgical and skin diseases (such as eczema and stubborn tinea), followed by lower leg ulcers, tuberculous lymphadenitis, and tuberculosis of the hip joint. These surgical cases are all difficult to treat. Dr. Bai's practice does not charge registration fees, only medication costs. For surgical dressings, he also gives the patient some medicine to take home. He charges at most five or six cents. Baozhen Town is the only place within 40 or 50 miles that has a new medical clinic, so Dr. Bai has been able to maintain his practice in Baozhen for more than a year, also because the cost of living in the town is low. The most remarkable thing is that traditional Chinese medicine doctors and new medicine doctors not only do not oppose each other but also want to connect with new medicine doctors. When my friend and I went to chat at two traditional Chinese medicine stores, the doctors and staff of the store were very welcoming and even offered us tea and wine. They spoke with great admiration. This is very different from the situation in Shanghai, where traditional Chinese medicine and new medicine are opposed to each other. I also investigated a foreign goods store that sells Western medicine on behalf of others. All the medicines sold are manufactured drugs, such as aspirin tablets and quinine sulfate tablets. I bought three Phenalgin tablets at his store for 800 cash each. Because other stores could not buy them, the value was so great. Otherwise, I would have to go to Zhenjiang to buy them. The round-trip fare for 90 miles would cost more than 800 cash. I also investigated the traditional Chinese medicine stores. Two of the larger ones still have valuable medicines such as antelope horn, rhinoceros horn, ginseng, and musk. However, the value is impressively high. At my friend's house, I saw a prescription for three fen of antelope horn and four fen of rhinoceros horn, plus more than a dozen other medicines, which cost 11.30 yuan. There were also two acupuncture doctors. One is the owner of a silver shop, and the other is a former teacher who treats heatstroke for people every summer, with remuneration at the discretion of the patient. I was also invited by my friend to Chenfuzhuang Town for a consultation. The town has about 1,000 households, with a population of over 3,000. There are four medicine stores of various sizes. There are very few valuable medicines. Most of them are doctors who run their own medicine stores, combining diagnosis and medicine sales. A small medicine store owned by a person named Yuan has a small amount of Western medicine, such as yellow iodine tincture. The young owner of the store said that he had studied new medicine, but I do not believe this. There is also one acupuncture doctor and one ophthalmologist, all of whom are natives. From these two towns, it can be seen that there is a lack of new medical talent. According to the natives of Baozhen Town, in years of good harvest, each medicine store earns about 700 to 800 yuan per year for the larger ones and over 300 yuan for the smaller ones. This year, due to the bankruptcy of the rural economy, all the medicine stores, large and small, are not enough to cover expenses. In the two towns, almost 7 or 8 out of 10 families do not have enough to eat, so how can they have money to see a doctor? If they are sick, they naturally endure it, waiting to get better or waiting to die. It is truly very pitiful. In these two places, in less than half a month, I treated about 60 patients completely free of charge. Some borrowed money or pawned their clothes to buy medicine, and some could not even afford medicine. If this continues, how can the villagers have healthy bodies? Furthermore, there is nothing to commend in the health conditions of the two towns. There are eight toilets in the streets. Some have a manure tank outside the door, and there are five or six urine buckets in each alley. Flies are flying everywhere. Flies eat the food in the restaurants first, and people eat it later. Not to mention the drinking water. Because of the drought this year, the river water is low. The water that is drawn is muddy water. It cannot be drunk unless it is clarified with alum. It is like talking to a cow when you talk to them about hygiene. Now I have a suggestion to organize several groups of traveling medical teams, led by qualified doctors and nurses, carrying a large amount of medicine, to go to various towns for medical treatment, and to set up health propaganda centers, for half a month or a month in each town. The villagers can get a lot of benefits. But where can this money be raised? I think it would be better if the government could do it. Otherwise, prominent figures in Shanghai should take the lead and ask philanthropists to donate money to organize it. This is definitely the primary task of helping farmers. But I dare not make a rash judgment on whether it can become a reality.</p>
<h3>Current Medical and Health Conditions in Songjiang (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Fu Jiren</p>
<p>(9) Newly Emerging Anti-Smoking Clinic</p>
<p>The county-run anti-smoking clinic began preparations around October of last year and was announced as established on the 20th. It officially opened on November 1st. Feng Youlu, a member of the Provincial Anti-Smoking Committee, serves as the director. The clinic is located in the old Lou County Chenghuang Temple. It is divided into examination, dispensing, testing, and laboratory rooms, as well as wards. The wards are further divided into voluntary and compulsory types, with separate sections for men and women. The staff includes the director, who also serves as the attending physician, two assistant physicians, one laboratory technician, two nurses, and four administrative staff. Since its opening, a total of 39 people have been tested. 23 people voluntarily quit, and 79 people were ordered to quit. The results have been very good. The clinic's anti-smoking methods primarily involve blistering, combined with serum therapy, injection therapy, and gradual reduction of narcotics. The approach is determined based on the individual's physical condition and financial situation. Most people can quit within about a week. After quitting, a certificate is issued. The fees are divided into three types: Type A costs 20 yuan, Type B costs 10 yuan, and Type C costs 2 yuan, with meals charged separately.</p>
<p>(10) Charitable Organizations</p>
<p>(A) Songjiang Branch of the Chinese Red Cross Society: This society was established during the Jiangzhe War in the Republic of China in 1924. It does not have a fixed address and often borrows various hospitals as temporary locations. Initially, due to the war, it operated a temporary wounded soldier hospital and several refugee shelters. In 1927, when the Revolutionary Army arrived, the hospital was closed, and many of those in charge left their positions. Later, it held several seasonal epidemic hospitals every summer. Recently, due to the large number of refugees passing through Zhejiang Province, a temporary Zhejiang drought refugee shelter was established at Chao Guo Temple. It began receiving refugees on the 31st of last month. On one hand, it distributed food, etc. On the other hand, the society appointed Ke Deqiong and Zhang Shaoxiu as Western medicine directors and two traditional Chinese medicine doctors to provide medical treatment and medication.</p>
<p>(B) Charitable Medical Bureau: This bureau is operated by the Songjiang Chamber of Commerce only in the summer season. It is divided into Western and traditional Chinese medicine departments. It charges a registration fee of six copper coins and provides epidemic prevention injections for a period of only three months.</p>
<p>(C) County Hospital: Every summer, a temporary epidemic prevention department is specially set up to provide free epidemic prevention injections. For consultations, the fee is charged according to the charitable medical care example. The hospital also has several wards and sends doctors and nurses to various public institutions to administer epidemic prevention injections.</p>
<p>Although this county has the above-mentioned charitable organizations, the former is merely a social welfare enterprise and lacks hospital facilities. The latter is only a short three-month period in the summer and does not provide completely free medical treatment and medication. Therefore, it is hoped that the government authorities will pay attention to this.</p>
<p>(11) New Medical Organizations</p>
<p>Although there are more than a dozen doctors in Songjiang, there is no doctors' association or other new medical organization. Furthermore, there are no new medical publications, and even newspapers do not publish anything about this. No one has even proposed this. I deeply regret this for my fellow new medicine practitioners!</p>
<p>(12) Conclusion</p>
<p>I have been in Songjiang for only three and a half months. After intermittent inquiries and investigations for over a month, I was finally able to complete this article. After this investigation, I have countless thoughts. First, in terms of health administration, Songjiang is very close to Shanghai. It only takes a little over an hour by train or car. Therefore, all construction should be very developed. However, the narrow streets remain the same. The most prosperous east-west thoroughfare in the city can only accommodate one rickshaw at a time. Although there are health administration facilities, they are practically nonexistent. It is said that this is due to financial constraints. Piles of garbage fill the streets, and the entrances of alleys are almost all public urinals. Even outside of summer, walking through these places is unbearably smelly. It is hard to imagine what it will be like in the summer. The entire city does not have running water, let alone artesian wells. Most people take water from the river, and the same river water is used for washing rice and vegetables! Residents can only drink river water! For the first few days after my arrival, I really did not want to drink it, but there was no other way. Now, I no longer feel the suffering! I think the danger would be unimaginable during an epidemic!</p>
<p>Secondly, in terms of the new medical community, there are more than a dozen practicing physicians in Songjiang. Most of them are graduates of formal schools, and new medicine has been introduced for a long time. However, no new medical organization has been established to connect people's feelings and study academics with each other. In reality, due to private interests, there are often private disputes and secret struggles, which is also a shame for our new medical community.</p>
<p>There is another matter that deserves discussion, which is that hospitals recruit students and have them serve as nurses, which seems to be a method of the old medicine. I don't know if other places have this situation or not?</p>
<p>The new drug industry here can be said to be sluggish. No pharmacists are hired to fill prescriptions for patients, and only a few prepared medicines are sold. Business is very limited. Sometimes, medicines are needed that can only be found in Shanghai, which is truly disappointing!</p>
<p>Furthermore, the county hospital, of all places, has such simple equipment and disorganized organization that it is unbelievable. However, the reason for this is nothing more than financial difficulties and limited income. And the special situation is that it cannot be a private person serving as hospital president: this is rarely seen elsewhere. It is hoped that the county government officials will correct this!</p>
<p>Finally, I would like to express my special thanks to Dr. Ke Deqiong and Mr. Lu Jianfen, the patrol officer of the First District! I am grateful for your guidance and help, which provided me with a lot of material to complete this article!</p>
<h3>General Knowledge of Ear, Nose, Throat, and Eye Hygiene</h3>
<p>— Tang Renjin</p>
<p>(41) The Eardrum</p>
<p>The eardrum is an important part of the auditory system. Its function is similar to the stylus of a phonograph. Its shape is also similar. If a phonograph does not have a stylus, or if the stylus is damaged, it cannot produce sound. Therefore, in the auditory system, if the eardrum is missing, or if the eardrum is diseased, then hearing will naturally also be difficult (of course, there are also all other dangerous symptoms). This is because the eardrum is the main part of transmitting sound waves in the auditory system. It is absolutely essential that there are no pathological changes. Therefore, when otologists examine ear diseases, they must first carefully examine the eardrum to see if it is maintaining its physiological state and whether there are any pathological changes. The physiological state of the eardrum is inherently complex. Now, it may be useful to give a rough explanation. At the same time, this can also serve as an opportunity to answer those who usually ask me, "What is the eardrum like?"</p>
<p>(1) Location of the Eardrum: The eardrum is a membrane that separates the external auditory canal from the tympanic cavity (which belongs to the middle ear). Therefore, its location is at the junction of the external auditory canal and the tympanic cavity.</p>
<p>(2) Shape of the Eardrum: The eardrum is a grayish-white color... It varies slightly depending on the age. The eardrum of newborns and infants is perfectly round. The eardrum of adults is oval. Furthermore, due to its shape, it is divided into two parts: the pars tensa (Figure 1) and the pars flaccida (Figure 2). The pars tensa occupies most of the eardrum. The pars flaccida occupies a small part of the eardrum. These two parts are separated by two folds. The one that goes forward is called the anterior malleolar fold (Figure 3). The one that goes backward is called the posterior malleolar fold (Figure 4).</p>
<p>(3) Shape of the Surface of the Eardrum: At the meeting point of the two folds mentioned in paragraph (2), there is a small protruding part called the short process of malleus (Figure 5). From there downward, the handle of the malleus can be observed (Figure 6). In the center of the eardrum, there is an umbo-shaped part called the umbo (Figure 7). Anteroinferior to the umbo, there is a cone of light (Figure 8). When we use an otoscope to examine the eardrum, we can often see the triangular reflection of light.</p>
<p>(4) Tissue Structure of the Eardrum: The tissue of the eardrum is composed of three layers: the cutaneous layer, the fibrous layer, and the mucous layer. However, the pars flaccida of the eardrum does not have a fibrous layer.</p>
<p>(5) Importance of the Eardrum for Hearing: There are two pathways for external sound waves to transmit to our auditory system and cause hearing: one is air conduction, and the other is bone conduction. Bone conduction is transmitted by the vibration of the skull. Air conduction is the main pathway for sound wave transmission. That is, external sound waves first pass through the external auditory canal to the eardrum, and then the eardrum conducts them to the three ossicles connected to it (that is, the malleus, incus, and stapes, which are the three ossicles contained in the tympanic cavity and epitympanic recess. These three ossicles are also connected to each other by joints.) The vibration of the ossicles then reaches the inner ear. Only then does hearing occur.</p>
<p>(6) When Will the Eardrum Have Pathological Changes: The scope of this question is very broad. Simply put, trauma to the eardrum, stenosis of the Eustachian tube, blockage of the Eustachian tube, inflammation of the middle ear, and various acute infectious diseases (such as influenza, bronchitis, pneumonia, scarlatina, scarlet fever, measles, typhoid fever, etc.) can all cause pathological changes in the eardrum. Detailed explanations will be given in the future.</p>

<h3>The Medical Science of Pain Relief</h3>
<p>— Li Xing</p>
<p>(8)</p>
<p>Intestinal Obstruction: Intestinal obstruction is a very painful and dangerous condition. There are several types of intestinal obstruction: (1) Intestinal strangulation, accounting for about 35% of all obstructions. (2) Intestinal knots and twists, accounting for about 12% of the total. (3) Intussusception, accounting for 38% of the total. (4) Obstruction of the intestine by foreign objects, accounting for 11% of the total. (5) Intestinal stricture or obstruction by internal or external tumors, accounting for 4% of the total. The first type (Strangulation) is common in adults. The second type often results from injury or taking strong laxatives. The third type involves one segment of the intestine telescoping into another, and it mostly affects young children and infants. The fourth type involves foreign objects such as gallstones, swallowed foreign objects, or intestinal parasites blocking the intestine. The fifth type, intestinal stricture, is often the result of dysentery, intestinal tuberculosis, intestinal syphilis, etc. Furthermore, abdominal tumors can also obstruct the passage within the intestines.</p>
<p>Acute intestinal obstruction begins with severe abdominal pain. The pain initially starts at the site of obstruction and gradually spreads to the entire abdomen. The pain is also often reflected in the center of the abdomen. Small intestinal obstruction is more painful than large intestinal obstruction. If peritonitis accompanies intestinal obstruction, the abdominal pain is even more severe, to the point where even a light touch on the abdomen is unbearable.</p>
<p>Now, let's briefly discuss methods of pain relief. Most cases of acute intestinal obstruction require surgery. Chronic obstruction can be treated with medication. However, simply using narcotics for pain relief is incorrect because narcotics only eliminate the sensation of pain but do not address the underlying problem. Acute intestinal obstruction is a very dangerous condition. If one relies on narcotics to delay treatment, it may ultimately be too late to save the patient. Such use cannot but be considered a misuse of narcotics. Common people use laxatives to treat all kinds of abdominal ailments, but using them for intestinal obstruction pain is like adding fuel to the fire. The reason is that the already obstructed intestine is further stimulated to move vigorously (the effect of laxatives), which would only worsen the obstruction. Therefore, one must never recklessly take laxatives for abdominal pain, lest one invite disaster upon oneself.</p>
<p>Renal Colic: Sometimes stones form in the kidneys, and sometimes kidney stones fall into the ureter. When the stone passes through the ureter, it causes a very intense pain, known as renal colic. This pain often comes suddenly, like a bolt from the blue. The pain is felt in the kidney area and also radiates to the abdomen, lower abdomen, bladder, inner thigh, and genitals. This type of pain is considered one of the most severe of all, and even the strongest person will writhe and scream. The pain only ends when the stone reaches the bladder. During the pain, blood and blood cells can be found in the urine.</p>
<p>Treatment for this type of pain is of an emergency nature because the pain can end within a few hours or days. Therefore, when the pain is unbearable, injecting morphine is considered humane. Of course, the use of narcotics should be discontinued as soon as the pain stops.</p>
<p>Strangulated Hernia: Let's briefly discuss what a hernia is. The old Chinese term for it is "疝氣" (shàn qì). The character "疝" (shàn) probably originated from the observation that the abdomen or the scrotum of men protrudes and swells, thus the character "山" (shān, mountain) is placed next to the radical for illness. As for the "氣" (qì, energy) part of the term, it is now considered baseless. The protruding mass is not air. To understand what it really is, we simply need to understand the structure of the abdominal wall and the inside of the abdomen. Inside the abdominal cavity are the intestines, stomach, etc. The abdominal wall, from inside to outside, consists of the peritoneum (thin as paper), muscles, aponeurosis, and skin. Sometimes, there are cracks or weak spots in the muscles and aponeurosis of the abdominal wall, and the intestines protrude through these spots, gradually becoming larger over time. Sometimes, it also enters the scrotum, forming a scrotal hernia. Hernias rarely cause pain usually, but sometimes, the intestines within the hernia become twisted or strangulated, causing sharp, stabbing pain. Because the intestines are twisted, blood flow is disrupted; and if there is no blood flow, the twisted intestines will become necrotic (locally dead) within a few hours. At this point, if surgical intervention is not performed, the patient will gradually lose hope of survival. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Tax Stamps and the Medical Profession</h3>
<p>— Song Guobin</p>
<p>The motivation for writing this article stems from two recent events. One is that five years ago, the Suzhou Tax Stamp Bureau ordered the local medical community to affix tax stamps to prescriptions. Despite repeated opposition from the medical community, the issue remains unresolved. The other is that recently, the Medical and Pharmaceutical Review Society was fined twenty yuan for forgetting to affix a two-cent tax stamp to an advertising receipt.</p>
<p>The government's implementation of the tax stamp regulations is specifically designed for industrial and commercial enterprises that operate for profit. In other words, it is equivalent to a type of business tax for industrial and commercial activities. Although the medical profession is one of many professions, its aim is to save lives and it bears the responsibility of safeguarding the health of the people. Therefore, most countries treat doctors with special respect and do not view them as operating a business. As for Chinese medicine, it is still in its infancy. If the government intends to promote this profession, it should give special consideration. Instead, it is arbitrarily demanding that doctors affix tax stamps to prescriptions. A prescription is neither a receipt nor a contract, and it is different from a pharmacy's sales invoice. The pharmacy's invoice requires a tax stamp because it involves the profit-making nature of business. Now, to treat a prescription for saving lives as the same as a profit-making invoice is no different from regarding medical practitioners who use scientific knowledge as mere merchants operating solely for profit. The fallacy is self-evident. That's one point.</p>
<p>The Medical and Pharmaceutical Review Society is part of the Sino-Belgian Geng Funds Committee's undertaking. Its publication, Medical and Pharmaceutical Review, focuses exclusively on promoting academic knowledge and disseminating medical and health information. The society is purely an academic and cultural institution and has no business nature whatsoever. Advertising revenue is only used to cover printing costs. The court's failure to understand this and imposing a heavy penalty seems inappropriate. That's another point.</p>
<p>Consider the fact that tax stamps and postage stamps occupy equally important positions in the government's revenue. Therefore, failure to affix tax stamps and failure to affix postage stamps are both subject to penalties. However, the penalty for insufficient postage is only doubled, such as a one-cent deficiency being penalized by two cents, and a two-cent deficiency being penalized by four cents! As for failing to affix tax stamps, the penalty is more than a thousand times higher. Article 5 of the Provisional Regulations on Tax Stamps states:</p>
<p>"For each item that should have had a tax stamp affixed but did not, or was affixed but not stamped with a seal or signature, a fine of between ten and one hundred yuan shall be imposed. For each item that was understamped, a fine of between five and fifty yuan shall be imposed, with the specific amount determined based on the circumstances."</p>
<p>From this, it is evident that the penalties for failing to affix tax stamps are alarming! Tax stamps and postage stamps are both state-run enterprises, yet the severity of the penalties differs so drastically. This is truly puzzling. That's a third point.</p>
<p>In summary, the Provisional Regulations on Tax Stamps truly need to be revised. I, in my humble opinion, propose several suggestions for consideration during future revisions:</p>
<p>Article 3 of the Provisional Regulations states:</p>
<p>"Contracts, documents, and other vouchers used by the state shall not be affixed with tax stamps."</p>
<p>The intention of this article is very clear, as the contracts, etc., used by the state are not of a commercial nature. Therefore, the following sentence continues with "Various state-run industries of a commercial nature must still be affixed," from which it can be known that the affixing of tax stamps is limited only to state-run and private industrial and commercial enterprises of a commercial nature. Cultural institutions are certainly not commercial enterprises, and doctors treating illnesses are even more different from industrial and commercial activities. I suggest adding "Contracts, documents, and other vouchers used by cultural institutions and doctors shall not be affixed with tax stamps" to this article, in order to align with the government's purpose of implementing the tax stamp regulations.</p>
<p>The reason why people fail to affix tax stamps is not always due to intentional tax evasion. Some people occasionally neglect or forget to affix them. If heavy fines are imposed on all cases, there will inevitably be many unjust situations. Therefore, the penalty amount should follow the example of insufficient postage, with a penalty of double the amount being sufficient.</p>

<h3>The Drawbacks of Excessive Flexibility</h3>
<p>— Lingmo</p>
<p>Many people now oppose the tolerance of writing variant characters. However, the opponents seem to have not touched upon the most fundamental point. That a character should have a fixed way of writing is an extremely simple and undeniable statement. But now we only know that it "should" be the case, and cannot definitively say that it already "is" the case. A character's writing has changed from ancient times to the present. It is unquestionable that the current way is better than the former, but the current way is certainly not perfect. If it were extremely appropriate, then everyone would write it the same way and there would be no differences. The fact that some people still write a certain character in a variant form indicates that the character itself still has a problem, and that the fixed way of writing for that character still requires time to emerge. Tolerating variant characters is likely to encourage this natural development. In this natural development, the writing of that character will unify one day without being planned. Therefore, the difference between those who tolerate variant characters and those who oppose them is only the difference in how to arrive at a fixed way of writing. Opponents want to immediately select one from the existing ways of writing, while those who tolerate variant characters allow time to produce one.</p>
<p>Theoretically, a current decision is more straightforward than allowing time to decide, but who can propose a concrete method? Even if one could propose it, its effectiveness would be problematic. During the autocratic era, there were repeated attempts to do this. We can still see books like "Character Distinctions," which are probably their legacy or their toxic remnants. Those "correct writings" can probably only be considered obsolete now. There are many movable type characters now that have long deviated from the "correct characters" in the imperial examinations, and no one opposes using movable type now. These movable type characters, as variant characters, forged a path for themselves not long ago, and their position is not very stable. Some characters that can be used interchangeably with them still coexist. The difference in their degree of flexibility cannot be measured by a yardstick. Therefore, if we want to decide on the "correct writing" of a character now, commonly used characters are a greater obstacle than variant characters.</p>
<p>Thinking towards an extreme, being able to decide on a fixed writing for a character still cannot reduce the amount of difficulty in writing by much. Among many synonymous characters or words, it is even more necessary to be able to decide to use a certain character or word as the standard. Chinese scholars often need to have a vast vocabulary, and most of it is just another way of expressing a certain meaning, which can be called "variant words" and "variant phrases." If the purpose of those who advocate that characters have a fixed writing is to allow students to memorize fewer characters, then this aspect needs to be taken into consideration. Here, those who tolerate writing variant characters can easily solve this problem, because if it is allowed to replace characters with variant characters, then a small number of characters – it could be as few as one character to represent one sound – can represent all words and phrases. However, those who advocate tolerating writing variant characters generally do not advocate to such an extreme; and those who oppose writing variant characters do not think that their proposition of saving vocabulary is difficult to carry out thoroughly.</p>
<p>In short, if Chinese characters tolerate writing variant characters, the drawback is that it is too flexible. Even if the writing of variant characters is not tolerated, the abundance of characters and words that can express one meaning still makes it too flexible. Perhaps this is the so-called advantage of abundant vocabulary, but this advantage should be displayed in large dictionaries, not what is generally needed. Now, probably even in very small dictionaries, half of the content is such obsolete material. The current dispute between variant characters and movable type characters would be very good if it could lead to a standard dictionary for the general public. Naturally, it would seem simpler to solve this problem by trying to compile a standard vernacular dictionary.</p>
<h3>People and Books</h3>
<p>— Han Feng</p>
<p>Seclusion in the Mountains and Forests</p>
<p>"Xinmin Yebao" published a section in Youhuan Yusheng's "Men Shi Tan Hu Lu" about the play "The Peach Blossom Fan," quoting the section "Yuyun" where Xu Qingjun "visits and arrests hermits in mountains and forests by the order of the local government," saying that the authorities have "the painstaking effort to recruit talented people." In the quote, there are a few interesting dialogues. First, Xu Qingjun asked the old Master of Ceremonies, Su Kunshan, and Liu Jingting, saying: "Are you three hermits in mountains and forests?" The three of them replied: "We dare not, we dare not. Why do you ask about hermits in mountains and forests?" Xu Qingjun said: "Don't you three know? The Ministry of Rites is now submitting a memorial, searching for hermits in mountains and forests. The Grand Governor has posted notices, and the Provincial Administration Commissioner has issued documents for more than a month, but not a single person has registered. The Prefectural Magistrate is anxious and has sent us to visit and arrest people everywhere. You three must be them, quickly come back and talk to me." The old Master of Ceremonies replied: "You are wrong, sir. Hermits in mountains and forests, as well as famous scholars, are unwilling to come out of the mountains. I am just an old Master of Ceremonies who pretends to be refined, how could I go?" The other two also replied: "We two are friends who tell stories and sing songs. Now we have become fishermen and woodcutters, even less qualified." So Xu Qingjun concluded humorously: "You don't know, those famous scholars are all wise men who know the times. They have all left the mountains three years ago and are now looking for people like you." This satire makes fake hermits and fake famous scholars feel embarrassed. During the reform movement period, the people of "Xinmin Congbao" did not have a good impression of hermits in mountains and forests, and some novelists often satirized them. Wu Yanren's "Shanghai You Xi Lu" also involved these people. In the seventh chapter, he said: "We Chinese have always had a kind of famous scholar, who can either write some poems and lyrics, or write two classical essays, or understand a little epigraphy. The highest level is to annotate a part or half of an ancient book. These people all consider themselves famous scholars. When they walk, their eyes look at the sky, thinking that their knowledge is sufficient and relying on it to be proud of others. Generally, in China after the Middle Ages, this kind of famous scholar who is neither crazy nor demented has never been extinct, and there are many unprogressive people who follow them to learn." Although this refers to famous scholars, it is actually no harm to compare them with hermits in mountains and forests. It can be seen that the people who claim to be hermits and famous scholars are not actually in the mountains and forests, and it can also be seen that Xu Qingjun is really the biggest fool in the world to find "hermits" in the "mountains and forests."</p>
<p>"Nie Hai Hua Playbook"</p>
<p>Speaking of the "Nie Hai Hua" of the sick man of East Asia, everyone knows that this is an important novel after the reform movement. This book was first published in the magazine "Xiaoshuo Lin" at that time, and the first volume in Yi-si year was printed as a single book in Japan. The sequels seemed to have been moved to another publication "Xin Xiaoshuo" for publication. The Zhengzheng Bookstore printed a single book of "Nie Hai Hua", which was not actually the first time. After the publication of "Nie Hai Hua," a person named "Tian Dou Gong Ren" once adapted the first volume of ten chapters into a playbook, which was published in the magazine "Yu Yue Xiaoshuo", and later included in the "Shuo Bu Cong Shu" No. 46 published by the Zuoxue Society, together with another playbook "Yixia Ji" (also known as "Black Slave Repays Kindness," originally by Tokutaro Ozaki in Japan). This is rarely mentioned. The playbook is also divided into ten acts, and the plot is exactly the same as the original book, but there is nothing particularly excellent about it. However, there are some things worth mentioning, such as the lyrics of the fifth act describing Zang Lan losing Ma Guan:</p>
<p>(Zang Zhan Cheng sings) Banners wave like dragons and snakes, want to repel the enemy's hundreds of thousands of troops. Zhan stands on the city tower to watch accurately, the soldiers are like a tide rushing up. In a flash, black smoke rises like clouds, thunderous cannons fall on the border city. (French soldiers fire cannons and bombard the city) (Killed down) (Zang runs barefoot and sings) For a time, the army was defeated like a mountain falling, killing me and throwing away my armor. One wrong move loses the whole game, a scholar using force misunderstands the six tactics. Behind the scenes, they only blame each other, he should not have given me a plan. Training soldiers and generals is unreliable, diplomatic negotiations and money are the best plan. Today I lost Ma Guan Road, what face do I have to face the court. Running forward naked, to see Chuan Xiang and tell the roots. (Inner field shouts) The sound of cannons is endless in my ears, the French are victorious and proud, I have no choice but to join the refugee road (dressed as refugees), wearing a copper basin on my head to find a way to escape. (Wearing a copper basin and escaping)</p>
<p>The satire of Zang is really spicy, making people feel neither good nor bad when they hear these lyrics. In the seventh act, Xu Hongquan came on stage with a section of lyrics about imperialist aggression, marked as "tight board":</p>
<p>France, occupies Vietnam, the frontier of Fujian warns. Germany, invades Weihai, Shandong is uneasy. England, rushes to business, opens eight provinces. Russia, invades the north, wants to make an alliance. The five great powers, rise in ambition, thinking of annexing. Japan, of the same race, also has evil intentions. Urgent reports fly, telegrams fly, the political system is not stable. Every day, talking about negotiations, exhausting the tongue.</p>
<p>It explains the situation of China at that time and the situation of being invaded. These few lines are the most clearly stated. As for the other acts, they are just average. I only saw this volume of the playbook, and I don't know if there are any works after the second volume.</p>

<h3>Seclusion</h3>
<p>— Liu Shi</p>
<p>I have never liked going to places like large stages, so I know very little about the scenery and characters there. When I was young, there were Han classes and Peking Opera in my hometown. Occasionally, I would go to these places with adults, but I would always sneak away before the end of the show. I didn't want to see the ghost faces painted on the actors' faces, and I also hated them walking in figure eights on the stage. I felt that it was too unreasonable. But the adults always said to me that there was a reason for this, that painting ghost faces to make facial masks, and changing the way people walk to stage steps, were all the thresholds of Peking Opera and Han Opera. True drama connoisseurs pay the most attention to it. It is said that a Peking Opera troupe once went to C city, and was chased away by the audience as soon as it took the stage, just because a big painted face was missing a black line on its forehead, the Huadan did not scan the audience with her eyes when she came on stage, and the Zhengsheng walked two more steps in the figure eight path. It is said that from then on, the Peking Opera troupe knew that the people of C city had sharp eyes, and before entering the city, they had to silently pray to the fire god.</p>
<p>However, when I was fifteen years old, I exposed the secret of this face-painting and discovered the real threshold. That was one night when I went backstage with my fourth brother and saw the face of the big painted face actor, who looked like a pig, with black pimples all over his face and many fleshy tumors, and also with dirty and annoying beards. I immediately decided in my heart, ah! So that's the role of the face painting. He has to hide that ugly ghost face, how can he not use a mask? At the same time, I also saw that the Huadan Xiaosheng seemed a bit cute and respectable when they appeared in front of the stage, but once they got backstage, took off their makeup, and started to flirt with the "gentry and merchants" who supported her or him, what was there to love and respect?</p>
<p>After that, I generally stopped going to these places. At the same time, with a bit of disrespect, I didn't like the old Chinese operas very much. Although there are still people singing against Jiang Kanghu there to promote the national essence and shouting some nonsense about "real plays."</p>
<p>As for the "so-called public entertainment" of "40 to 50 people crowded together on the sidewalk," whether it is selling solutions, performing tricks, or singing a section of Peking Opera tunes, two or three sentences of ditties, or even a "drizzle" at the same time, although the performance is "without a certain scope," like acting in a play but not guaranteeing that the big stage can "perform the whole play," and there is no rehearsal, no stage, no walking on the stage, no red and purple paint to draw face paintings, and the sound from the mouth is just some sandy sounds, I have never disliked it. In my hometown, my favorite entertainment venues were the Fire God Temple, Water Wind Well, and Education Association Square areas. I often squeezed in among many dirty crowds to appreciate this "public entertainment."</p>
<p>When I got to Beijing, I only saw Dr. Mei Lanfang's male扮女相 once, and the place I often went to was Tianqiao, Tianqiao, and the third place was still Tianqiao. When I got to Shanghai, "near the Mud City Bridge on Tibet Road," Edward Road, and the City God Temple were also my favorite places to play. Yes, this is a bit of a "low-level taste," "vulgar," but I also feel that these low-level "artists," although they are either authentic "rice buckets" or some sing poorly, the women don't know how to make coquettish eyes, and the men's faces show a big scar, I think it's more straightforward than hiding and concealing on the stage, and the "hypocritical" ugliness is much more straightforward because I only see hunger on the faces of the street "artists," and no lewdness, and they are just begging with simple skills, but there is no ugliness hidden backstage, and they are deceiving in front of the stage. Although they are either incompetent, they are not as "hard and slippery" as rubbing thighs backstage.</p>
<p>Naturally, street performing is not a noble art, just as begging is not a proper profession. Those who are fascinated by this kind of "street art" naturally have a life content that is not much worse than these "artists." As for people like us who still have a set of Western suits to wear, although we don't consider these "low-level" "public" entertainment to be so lowly, there is a certain limit to its interest.</p>
<p>Therefore, we must first demand the improvement of the lives of the masses, and at the same time improve their entertainment, which is not enough to laugh at. Especially when the "masses" are still living such a life, sinking into such a form of interest, we must abandon the old type, but we must study the new type. We oppose low-level tastes, but we cannot close our eyes and dream of heaven. What's more, when new tastes reach the masses, using the old type is also a way?</p>
<p>As for using a mocking and scolding attitude to curse the growing scientific essays, comparing it to the slapstick on the street, and thinking that oneself is criticizing, that only shows its superficiality. I feel that the power of face painting in China is really great. People who are a little afraid of the sun and dare not face the truth need one to hide themselves.</p>
<h3>Cook</h3>
<p>— Liu Baiyu</p>
<p>On the ragged stall of the black market cloth,</p>
<p>Patches of oil reflect the shadows of the people opposite.</p>
<p>The water pot on the fire spews white smoke,</p>
<p>He gazes at a little cat's yawn.</p>
<p>Every day, baking lost fates on the stone stove,</p>
<p>Today, he will be saddened by a slaughtered little fish.</p>
<p>A bead of sweat hangs down from his rough eyelids,</p>
<p>He tastes the bitterness of a black stain on the ground.</p>
<h3>Mr. Juqing (3)</h3>
<p>— Ke Ling</p>
<p>Having entered middle age, Mr. Juqing was burdened by family responsibilities and tormented by his circumstances. His ambitions had long been extinguished by the headwinds of life. Amidst utter boredom, he began to pick up that silver cinnabar brush of his, its future bleak and desolate.</p>
<p>On the one hand, he placed all his hopes for a better future on his "only son." Because at this time, he already had an honest and capable son working as a clerk in a silk factory in Hangzhou, doing quite well. But it seemed that Mr. Juqing was destined to have bad luck all his life. Ten years ago, just when he and his wife were happily preparing for their son's wedding, the silk factory happened to close down, and the son lost his job, becoming idle at home. He was competitive and possessed his father's inherited stubbornness. After several setbacks in society, he developed a deep, chronic depression. After being depressed and idle for more than a year, he quietly died from a contagious epidemic, leaving behind his elderly parents and his young wife, who was four months pregnant.</p>
<p>The red candle of hope was burned into endless tears, leaving only inches of ashes. From then on, the family relied on Mr. Juqing's silver cinnabar brush skills, supplemented by the needlework of the mother and daughter-in-law, to endure the long journey on the barren road of life, devoid of flowers or grass.</p>
<p>Like a snail crawling up a wall, this unbearable time somehow passed for ten years. During this time, life was naturally miserable. Mr. Juqing's only solace was his grandson, the posthumous child of his son, who had now grown to eight years old and could recite the Thousand Character Classic and the Divine Child Poetry perfectly.</p>
<p>However, people are getting older year by year, and the world seems to be collapsing year by year.</p>
<p>In the past two years, a strange phenomenon suddenly occurred in this town. Mr. Juqing, who was in his sixties, began to see fewer and fewer students coming to him to study, while the number of private schools teaching the classics gradually increased. As long as someone had a little knowledge of writing, everyone treated it as a non-depleting business. Many so-called "scholarly families" who originally stayed in their hometowns tending to their fields, feeling the decline of their fortunes and the depletion of their resources, all became teachers. A few young shop assistants who had lost their jobs in other cities returned and either asked someone to recommend them to become teachers in small schools or cleared out an empty room at home to open a private school.</p>
<p>This situation made Mr. Juqing very angry, as if someone had scolded his ancestors for three generations. Whenever he talked to someone about it, he would blush and shake his head, sighing about how "teachers are worthless these days." Because this situation not only tarnished the noble reputation of the education profession but also affected the prosperity of Mr. Juqing's private school.</p>
<p>The number of Mr. Juqing's disciples decreased year after year.</p>
<p>The most difficult thing to deal with was the overt and covert competition from the district-established elementary schools against the private schools. Because the schools naturally wanted to find ways to increase enrollment, just like shops expanding their business to attract customers. Therefore, last year, the school took the initiative to investigate private schools and ban them, which caused quite a stir several times.</p>
<p>Although many government officials and social celebrities have been advocating the study of classics in the past two years, the slogan of the schools banning private schools is still the old argument that education is outdated and misleads students.</p>

<h3>Brevity</h3>
<p>— Zhen</p>
<p>Attention to Telegraphers and Political and Military Agencies</p>
<p>Whether the wording of a telegram is concise or not has a great relationship with the effectiveness of the telegram. The wording of Chinese plain language telegrams should be mainly based on clarity of meaning. If the wording is so concise that only one word is used, the sender has the right to weigh the cost savings. However, if this word does not express any meaning, the telegraph office will treat the telegram as code and charge double the fee. For example, if the telegram only lists words such as "arrive," "safe," "received," "rise," "shrink," "fall," "slow," "come," "go," etc. Although it is only one word, the meaning is obvious, and it can be charged at the plain language rate. As for other single words that do not conform to customary usage or whose meaning cannot be understood without explanation, such as "swim," "lead," "sword," "fire," etc., the sender should add one or two words to clarify their meaning. Otherwise, it must be charged as code. Therefore, the definition of brevity must be limited by clarity. Brevity without clarity cannot achieve the purpose of saving costs.</p>
<p>Political and military agencies often make the mistake of using lengthy wording in telegrams. For example, telegrams reporting military situations or announcing political orders often run into the thousands of words. Upon closer examination, much of the content is embellishment. Not only does translation and transmission cost a lot of manpower and time, but it is also very easy to make mistakes in copying and transmitting the full page. Since it is neither accurate nor fast, the matter has become old news. If the text is full of errors, what is the point of sending this telegram? Therefore, the drafters of political and military agencies should know that the effectiveness of a telegram lies in speed and accuracy, and the key to achieving these two goals lies in the conciseness of the wording. All official document phrases and propaganda articles should not be included in the telegram. It must be concise, comprehensive, simple, and refined. Then it can be delivered in an instant during transmission and understood at a glance during reading. The telegraph office can save materials, and the agency can save electricity costs. The key to this transformation lies in the intention of the drafter. Therefore, the definition of clarity must be limited by brevity. Clarity without brevity also has no efficiency to speak of.</p>
<p>Commander-in-Chief Chiang knew the necessity of concise wording in telegrams and issued an order to the military and political agencies of the three provinces of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui in January of the 22nd year, stating that "It has been found that in recent years, various military and political agencies have been sending a large number of telegrams, either deliberately exaggerating the urgency or being excessively lengthy, causing the political circuits to be congested and telegrams to be backlogged. Important telegrams are delayed, which seriously hinders the timing of events. In the future, no matter which agency sends telegrams, the wording must be concise. Unless it is absolutely necessary, it should not exceed one hundred words. Unless it is a particularly urgent matter, the phrase 'deliver immediately' should not be used indiscriminately. Unless it is an emergency, express mail should not be used. Telegrams should not be sent at the drop of a hat," etc., and ordered compliance. At this time of urgent military telegrams for suppressing bandits, our military and political agencies should abide by this principle.</p>
<h3>Reasons for the Merger of Wired and Wireless Telegraphy</h3>
<p>— Yun</p>
<p>After the Ministry of Communications decided on the policy of merging wired and wireless telegraphy in May of last year, it first merged and reorganized the Shanghai Telegraph Office and the Wireless Station. The name was still the Telegraph Office. After a few months of trial operation, the results were excellent. Therefore, the four offices in Nanjing, Beiping, Tianjin, and Hankou continued to merge in September. Until recently, in order to complete the merger of wired and wireless telegraphy nationwide, the Ministry of Communications ordered the following wireless stations to merge with the local telegraph offices from today (April 1):</p>
<p>Xiamen, Fuzhou, Qingdao, Baxian (i.e., Chongqing), Guangzhou, Shantou, Yichang, Changsha, Chengdu, Jinan, Zhangjiakou, Zhengzhou, Nanchang, Wanxian, Guiyang, Yantai, Guihua, Chang'an (i.e., Xi'an), Lanzhou, Ningxia.</p>
<p>From now on, except for the border areas or other places where telegraph offices have not been established, where independent wireless stations will still be responsible for communication, wired and wireless telegraphy in all places will be completely integrated and no longer separated.</p>
<p>In general people's minds, the word "merger" contains the meaning of "contraction." Therefore, it is often easy to believe that the Ministry of Communications' implementation of the merger of wired and wireless telegraphy is only a passive policy and has no relationship with public communication. However, both telegraph offices and radio stations are communication agencies, and the more there are, the more convenient people feel. Given the current transportation situation in China, there are too few of these agencies, so how can we rush to cut them back? Based on this consideration, we know that the Ministry of Communications' move must have other far-reaching reasons and cannot be equated with the contraction policies of general government agencies.</p>
<p>Upon careful examination, although wired and wireless telegraphy are both the fastest means of communication, they each have their own strengths and weaknesses due to technical characteristics. For example, wired telegraphy is easily disrupted in the event of war or banditry, while wireless telegraphy does not have this concern. Conversely, wireless telegraphy is easily disturbed by atmospheric electricity, while wired telegraphy does not have this disadvantage. Moreover, China has a vast territory and unstable local conditions. The telecommunications in the border areas and places with inconvenient transportation must fully utilize wireless telegraphy to supplement the shortcomings of wired telegraphy. The Ministry of Communications, in view of this, has always paid close attention to the cooperation and allocation of reporting affairs between wired and wireless telegraphy nationwide. However, the results of actual experience have shown that the only satisfactory method of cooperation is to implement the merger of offices and stations. The reasons are as follows:</p>
<p>A. Reduce Delays in Switching Telegrams: Telegraph offices and radio stations have never distinguished between each other when transmitting telegrams and have always switched them back and forth. For example, a telegram sent from Nanjing to Guangzhou is transmitted by landline between Nanjing and Shanghai because the telegraph office is equipped with a fast machine. The section between Shanghai and Guangzhou is transmitted by radio station after arriving in Shanghai because wireless communication is faster. After the telegraph office and the local radio station are merged, due to the closer connection, all the inevitable delays in the mutual switching of telegrams between offices and stations are reduced to a minimum. At the same time, the speed of telegrams is increased to the highest level.</p>
<p>B. Increase Work Efficiency: In the past, when offices and stations were separated, the organizational structure of both sides was roughly the same, and the distribution of personnel and affairs between the two sides was somewhat uneven. For example, the telegraph office and the radio station each had ten messengers, but sometimes the telegraph office was busier with reports, and its messengers felt that they were not enough. On the other hand, the messengers of the radio station might still have spare time. By extrapolating from this, all the receivers, decoders, dispatchers, etc. of the offices and stations have this situation. After the merger, the personnel on both sides can be comprehensively deployed, which will greatly benefit the increase in work efficiency.</p>
<p>According to the Ministry of Communications, the Shanghai Telegraph Office and the Wireless Station have seen a significant increase in business since the merger. It is expected that other places will also have the same trend. This proves that the general public has indeed felt the convenience of this measure.</p>
<h3>Telecommunications Employees Donate Machines to Save the Country</h3>
<p>— Zhong Luo</p>
<p>Since the January 28th Incident, the Chinese people have learned a lesson from the enemy planes' trampling and recognized that without consolidating air defense, it is not enough to resist foreign aggression. Therefore, donating money to purchase airplanes and enriching national defense has become the cause of knowledgeable people, winning broad support from the public. In recent years, people from all over the country have been donating money to purchase airplanes with great enthusiasm, driven by patriotism. Our telecommunications employees bear the heavy responsibility of telecommunications and transportation, and patriotism has never lagged behind others. This time, the entire staff donated their salaries to purchase three airplanes, which have been shipped to China and will be named at the Ming Palace Airport in the capital on the 4th of this month. They will be named the No. 1, No. 2, and No. 3 Telecommunications Employees' Aircraft to commemorate the event. In addition to being happy and grateful, the reporter uses a few words to fill this publication.</p>
<p>Although the telecommunications employees only donated three airplanes this time, considering the high value of airplanes, the cost is also quite high. Moreover, the salaries of telecommunications personnel are meager, and the amount of donations is limited. It is even more difficult to collect from employees scattered across the country. However, in the midst of these difficulties, they were able to achieve this result, which shows that in all undertakings, if everyone can be of one mind and work together, they will eventually achieve success.</p>
<p>I still remember that during the January 28th Incident, the Zhenru International Radio Station and the Shanghai Minguo Road Wireless General Station worked hard despite being surrounded by enemy planes, never showing any timidity. The tragic scene is still vivid. At that time, due to the lack of air defense in our country, enemy planes were allowed to come and go at will without any resistance. Our telecommunications employees were filled with grief and anger, and their eyes were bloodshot. Today, the telecommunications employees' aircraft will soar in the skies of the capital, and the national telecommunications and transportation industry will also have made great progress. Looking at the present compared to the past, we can also feel a little comforted.</p>
<p>Although, in recent years, our country's air defense has been somewhat scaled up through the concerted efforts of the entire country, it is still far behind the European and American powers. Recently, Germany declared its expansion of armaments. It is said that it can build seven airplanes every day, and in a few months, it can reach thousands of airplanes. Compared with the three airplanes donated by our telecommunications employees, it is not enough to supplement national defense even by one ten-thousandth. However, this expresses patriotism and promotes the cause of national defense, which has great significance.</p>
<h3>Recent Facilities at the International Radio Station</h3>
<p>— Ming</p>
<p>The International Radio Station is the only foreign communication agency in China run by the Chinese themselves. Its scale is far beyond the reach of other foreign-run communication agencies. Its internal administrative management, handling procedures, engineering facilities, communication technology, etc., are scientific and modern, and are praised by foreigners. Therefore, its business is developing and increasing day by day. Since the establishment of the station, its business income has increased tenfold compared to the past, which shows a glimpse of its business progress. All of these facts are due to the tireless efforts of the station's colleagues over the years, as well as the promotion and care of people from all walks of life. It was not achieved overnight or by luck. The following is a selection of the station's recent facilities and improvements, which I believe are also of interest to those who care about the station!</p>
<p>(1) Creating a Machine Bicycle to Receive Telegrams: The station, in view of the fact that the city of Shanghai is vast and the public in remote areas spends a lot of time traveling to the station to send telegrams, although it has established a method of receiving and sending telegrams by telephone to help them out, the senders and receivers of telegrams may not fully know how to use this method. Therefore, there is the innovative idea of using machine bicycles to receive telegrams. The motorcycle has now been purchased and is being painted with special logos. The implementation date is imminent. In the future, any member of the public or business firm residing in a remote place in the city who wishes to send an international telegram can notify the station at any time to send someone to ride a bicycle to receive the telegram. There is no need to personally travel a long distance.</p>
<p>(2) Enriching the Reporting Inquiries Office: The station has established an original inquiry office to facilitate inquiries from the public on reporting matters. This inquiry work was previously handled concurrently by public reporting officers. Sometimes, when public reporting was busy, responses were inevitably slightly delayed. Recently, business has increased sharply, and it has become more difficult to take care of everything. Therefore, starting last month, four business personnel who are proficient in English and familiar with reporting matters have been specially assigned to work day and night shifts to handle inquiry matters exclusively. People from all walks of life, if they have any inquiries about international telegrams, please call at any time to inquire (first call the station's main switchboard to the inquiry office), and you will get a satisfactory answer.</p>
<p>(3) Opening Telephone Receipt and Delivery of Japanese Telegrams: The station has been handling telephone receipt and delivery of telegrams for a long time. However, telephone receipt and delivery of telegrams in Japanese alphabets has only recently been opened. Since the opening of the direct communication circuit between China and Japan in the middle of last year, people from all walks of life have been asking for the opening of telephone receipt and delivery of the above-mentioned telegrams. The station immediately began preparations and officially implemented it starting last month. The results have been very satisfactory, because the personnel managing this work have been selected from those who are proficient in Japanese and have clear pronunciation.</p>
<p>(4) Adding Investigators of Messengers: The station's management of messengers delivering telegrams has always been extremely strict. All incoming telegrams are calculated based on the distance of the route, and a time limit is set for delivering them properly back to the station. Rewards are given for exceeding the time limit, and penalties are given for exceeding the time limit. Therefore, there has never been any delay in the delivery of incoming telegrams. Recently, in order to strengthen management, a special investigator of messengers has been established, whose duty is to inquire about whether there are any delays or delays in the delivery of telegrams by messengers. This measure is also a necessary measure for the station to maintain its prosperity and protect the interests of the public.</p>
<p>There are many other innovations and improvements at the station. Due to space limitations, they cannot be fully recorded. However, there is one thing that is worth mentioning: Yesterday, the reporter met with a certain person in charge of the station. Because he praised the station's prosperity and the excellence of its facilities, the person was silent for a while before saying: "Although the colleagues of this station have done their best from beginning to end to improve the business, hoping to implement the essence of commercializing telecommunications, the colleagues' talents and knowledge are limited, and there must be many omissions. We hope that you will inform the public as much as possible and tell us about the shortcomings of this station so that this station can gather ideas and benefit from them and use them as a reference for improvement. This is what the colleagues of this station sincerely hope for. As for the exaggerated words, we are ashamed to be unable to bear them." His humble and modest spirit is enough to show that the progress of the station's business will never have an end. I am happy to record this and tell the people of the world.</p>
<h3>From the Victory of Suppressing Bandits to the Government's Arrears in Telecommunications Fees</h3>
<p>— Bao Zhen</p>
<p>In the past two or three years, the Communist bandits have been a disaster. Not only have the people in the bandit areas directly suffered from their poisoning, but all economic and construction activities in various parts of the country have also indirectly declined and stagnated, and even affected the fundamental issues of the nation. Commander-in-Chief Chiang, in view of the fact that internal stability must come before resisting foreign aggression, personally supervised the army at the risk of his life and finally achieved the final victory in eliminating the bandit nests in Jiangxi Province. During the bandit suppression period, military news was related to success or failure and depended on the transmission of telegrams, which could not be delayed for even a moment. At the same time, because the military expenses of the bandit suppression army were huge, it was difficult to report military situations by telegram at full price and pay in cash. Therefore, the General Headquarters stipulated a method of collecting material costs for bandit suppression telegrams and consulted the Ministry of Communications to order telegraph offices to temporarily collect 50 cents for every hundred words of the above-mentioned military telegrams, and the remaining reporting fees would be recorded as arrears. (For example, if an official telegram is counted as 100 words, the reporting fee of 5 yuan should be collected according to regulations, but only 50 cents of material costs are collected first, and the remaining 4.5 yuan is recorded as arrears.) As of March of the 22nd year of the Republic of China, the accumulated amount of official military telegram arrears has reached more than 22 million yuan. The telecommunications department is affected by the official military telegram arrears. Not only can it not strive to expand machinery and materials and expand telegraph lines, but the wages of employees are in arrears by about 70% per month. The economy is exhausted, and it can be seen that the construction of telegraph offices and the repair of lines in the provinces of Fujian and Jiangxi, in particular, are not praised due to the military relationship of bandit suppression. The telecommunications revenue has decreased due to arrears, and the expenditure has doubled due to the restoration of bandit areas, the repair of telegraph lines, and the addition of telegraph offices. It is of course very difficult to struggle in this environment where income does not exceed expenditure. Now that the banditry has been quelled, all agriculture, industry, and commerce in the bandit areas are being planned for revival, and the people are eager to recover. It is hoped that the government will, within the possible scope, find a way to repay a part of the official military telegram arrears from the national treasury in installments to provide relief to this national telecommunications and transportation agency. So that the economic foundation of the telecommunications department can be stabilized. After a considerable period of effort, the telecommunications industry can be gradually promoted and develop day by day. Is this what our government "seeks unity through construction" is happy to do?</p>
<h3>Causes and Remedies for Telegram Errors (Continued from Previous)</h3>
<p>— Qinghua</p>
<p>The types and causes of errors have been described above. Now we want to study how to remedy them: I have come up with several remedies and written them below. If readers have any good ideas, send them to this publication for publication. That is not only my personal honor, but also a great blessing to the telecommunications industry!</p>
<p>1. Telegraphers should pay attention to three points: (1) The telegram must be written clearly, preferably typed. However, be careful to erase it with a rubber if you type it wrong. Do not be lazy and type another letter to avoid telegraph office personnel from not being able to see it clearly. (2) Self-translated codes should be proofread once after translation to avoid errors. The new codes published by the Ministry of Communications are more reliable. (3) The store number or name and address of the receiver should not be abbreviated and must be written correctly (English company names or names that differ by one or two letters are most likely to be misdelivered).</p>
<p>2. Receivers should also pay attention to three points: (1) If there are any doubtful words in the incoming telegram, you can check the following two tables to try to correct the wrong letters or numbers. If you cannot find the correct letters or numbers, send the telegram to the telegraph office for free inquiry. If the receiver can correct the error in the incoming telegram himself, he can save the trouble of inquiring with the telegraph office. (2) If you suspect that there are omissions in the words and sentences in the incoming telegram, you can check the number of characters actually listed in the number of characters column at the beginning of the telegram. (The number of characters in the number of characters column is often listed together with the number of characters charged. For example, if the number of characters is 3542, 35 is the number of characters charged, and 42 is the actual number of characters). Check whether it is consistent with the number of characters on the telegram. If there are a few words missing, you can determine that it is a mistake of the telegraph office and immediately inquire with it. (3) If you suspect that there are errors in the place of origin, date of transmission, or other columns, you can immediately inquire with the telegraph office without hesitation, and you do not need to send a telegram to inquire yourself.</p>
<p>3. The telegraph office has the following four methods of remedy, which have all been put into practice: (1) Each busy telegraph office has a special proofreader to proofread incoming and outgoing telegrams at any time. If there are any errors, a telegram is immediately sent to correct them. This is the best way to remedy manual errors. At the same time, strict punishment methods are also formulated for telegraph operators who type or copy telegrams incorrectly to warn them. (2) For mechanical and electrical aspects, special engineers and testers are set up to adjust at any time to ensure the accuracy of the code. (3) For misdelivered telegrams, a special reviewer is set up to compare the delivery receipt with the receiver's store number or name to ensure that if there are any errors, the messenger will be asked to resend it. (4) In order to investigate whether the senders and receivers are satisfied with the telegraph office's business, special business inspectors are set up to inquire with various business firms and individuals at any time. If there are telegram errors that have not been inquired with the telegraph office, the staff will report to the superior personnel and find out the responsible person to impose a penalty and find ways to improve.</p>
<p>In short, telegraph errors cannot be absolutely avoided in fact. We hope that senders and receivers will pay attention to the above-mentioned remedies and cooperate with the telegraph office so that errors can of course be reduced to a minimum and the effectiveness of telegrams will be more significant!</p>
<h3>Technology</h3>
<p>— Yiji</p>
<p>The term "technology" is very ancient. The Zhouli has a chapter on technology, which is considered the beginning of engineering records in our country. All construction depends on construction, and all engineering processes have their own rules. The so-called rules to be followed and guidelines to be followed, the great craftsmen gather materials and workers, and they are not separated from the rules. In the past, the Ministry of Communications, under the Department of Telecommunications, had a Department of Technology, which is now designated as the Department of Engineering. The scope of engineering is quite broad, and in addition to urging the progress, technology is especially important. What is defined here is only related to the technology, and the line arrangement and expansion will be described in another article.</p>
<p>The construction of wired telegraph lines initially borrowed materials from foreign countries and imitated the established rules of other countries. The old Ministry of Communications referred to the gains and losses and extracted from Western books to write a book entitled "Notes on the Construction of Telegraph Lines," which was published at cost and circulated for a long time. However, there are some inapplicable places in it, and the technical field has progressed with the times. The "Notes on Construction" has been compiled and printed for many years, and what was not mentioned at that time must also be supplemented in light of the current situation to be complete. Recently, the Ministry of Communications is actively promoting the long-distance telephone project in nine provinces, and the line construction is planned carefully. There are many improvements in the engineering field. The predecessors' descriptions, such as the ordinary cross, or phantom cross, or transposition cross, were not listed at that time because they were rarely used. Now, the technical staff have studied and translated them separately, and carefully drawn various diagrams, so that people can understand them at a glance. This is the "Long-Distance Telephone Line Construction Rules, which can be used as a compilation of standards for engineering."</p>
<p>There is one more thing, that is, starting from January of this year, the units used for national telecommunications materials and engineering measurements have been changed to be uniform. For example, telegraph wires were previously measured in pounds, but now they are changed to kilograms. The distance was previously measured in feet, but now it is changed to kilometers, meters, and even centimeters. After this change, there will not only be unified units in telecommunications engineering, but also consistency with other engineering technologies in the country. For example, the railway side has been calculating the length in kilometers for a long time, and there is no inconvenience.</p>
<p>In addition, the dedicated terms or material names for telegraphs, telephones, and wireless telegraphy have been translated from foreign languages, and they are not very unified: for example, Imsulator is called a spacer, or it can also be called a magnetic head; Motot is called an electric motor, or it can also be called a motor. The difference in naming makes it difficult to know what to do in terms of application, and the names in our country's telecommunications are now all in Chinese. The same thing, the names cannot be consistent with each other, which is rare in other countries, and it cannot show the great similarity of technology. I have heard that the Ministry of Communications is paying close attention to this point, and it is said that the unification of electrical materials and technical names will be announced soon.</p>
<h3>American Transpacific Wireless Telephone Station (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Jian</p>
<p>The transmitting station shares two sets of transmitting antennas, both of which are horizontally placed rhombuses. They are built in Dixon, with one set directly facing Honolulu and the other set oriented between Java and the Philippines. This is because the angle between these two locations as viewed from Dixon is very small. The results obtained using this antenna are only slightly different from those obtained using two sets of antennas aimed directly at each location. The two antenna wires are connected by iron double-use power lines, which are aperiodic and can be used for a wide range of frequencies. The transmission lines are balanced with the ground and are connected to the transmitter via an antenna selection switch.</p>
<p>Communicating with Hawaii, the Philippines, and Java</p>
<p>(II) Receiving Station. The American receiving station is built in Bolinas, California, 35 miles north of San Francisco. It uses a Western Electric D-91719 receiver, with a dual-detection circuit, which can be tuned to receive frequencies between 5 and 21 megahertz. Its amplification is approximately 110 A-rV. This receiver is composed of multiple individually shielded units, divided into four tuning boards and four relay racks. It has two stages of shielded-grid high-frequency amplifiers, a primary detector, an intermediate-frequency amplifier (with input and output band-pass filters), a linear secondary detector, and an audio-frequency amplifier. It also has automatic volume control to adjust for changes in field strength.</p>
<p>In addition to the above-mentioned receiver specifically for commercial communication, there are also multiple special receivers, all equipped with loudspeakers, for monitoring purposes. One of these is dedicated to tuning into various external frequencies during business communication hours to listen for calls from all parties.</p>
<p>The receiver's power supply is provided by a 24 and 130-volt automatic adjustment generator, and the voltage is extremely stable.</p>
<p>The station has three rhombic receiving antennas, also built in Bolinas. Two of them are periodic, for receiving two frequencies transmitted from Honolulu. The other is aperiodic and is used to receive signals from Java and the Philippines. Its direction is exactly the same as the aforementioned transmitting antenna, between the two locations. Because the angle between these two places as viewed from the American receiving station is extremely small, there is no need to set up separate directional antennas.</p>
<p>Next to the receiver is an antenna switchboard, allowing the receiver to be connected to any antenna. The connection between the antenna, the antenna board, and the antenna is made using coaxial transmission lines.</p>
<p>(III) Audio Frequency Control Equipment. Audio frequency control equipment is the main part of a wireless telephone circuit. The equipment installed at the San Francisco station includes a Western Electric terminal controller, with a secret mechanism for transforming sound. It includes an operator's monitoring and testing station (with volume display and controller), a "VODAS delay" (Voice Operated Device Anti-Sing delay), and a secret mechanism with a test board and power board. The so-called VODAS mechanism, in simple terms, is composed of a number of voice-activated relays, which short-circuit the transmission line to the transmitting building when the other party is speaking, and short-circuit the receiving line to the receiver when our party is speaking. Its purpose is to allow for the interaction of speaking and receiving in the radio circuit. The delay mechanism is used to store incoming and outgoing audio currents for a fraction of a second, so that the VODAS relay in the circuit can operate smoothly, making it a one-way radio communication circuit.</p>
<p>(IV) Telephone Switchboard. The audio frequency circuit is connected to a special switchboard in the San Francisco Long Distance Telephone Administration. The installation on this switchboard allows the operator to monitor the status of the amplifier circuit without interfering with its operation. The switchboard is also equipped with a special timer to record call time, but time lost due to transmission obstacles is not allowed.</p>
<p>(V) Connection Lines. The transmitter and receiver are connected to the audio frequency terminal control equipment using four-wire (one pair for transmitting, one pair for receiving) cable lines that transmit sound best (100 to 5,000 cycles per second). Telephone and telegraph order lines are also connected between them to facilitate work.</p>
<p>IV. Communication Frequencies. The following transmission frequencies are used for transpacific wireless telephone communication:</p>
<p>Dixon, California, USA Transmitting Station</p>
<p>KWN 21,060 C/S (14.2m.)</p>
<p>DWU 15,355 C/S (10.6m)</p>
<p>KWV 10,840 C/S (27.7m.)</p>
<p>KWX 7,610 C/S (39.4m.)</p>
<p>KKP 16,030 C/S (16.7m.)</p>
<p>O'ahu, Hawaii Transmitting Station (To be continued)</p>
<h3>News from Home and Abroad</h3>
<p>— Reporter</p>
<p>Kite-flying is an ancient game in our country. Every spring, when the weather is clear and the sky is bright, children enjoy this activity. Because it obstructs electric wires, the police department once banned it. Recently, in order to promote public games in the capital, kite-flying has been allowed, provided that a considerable distance from electric wires is maintained. Regular competitions are held, and looking up at the sky, dragons and phoenixes dance. By Rain Flower Terrace, ladies and gentlemen gather like clouds, making it quite a grand occasion for a time. Recently, I read a report in a London electrical magazine, based on news from California in the United States, stating that kite-flying games also exist there. I have translated it for your information, showing the thoroughness of foreigners' attention.</p>
<p>The Pacific Electrical Company, with the cooperation of the police department and schools, has repeatedly explained the matter of safe kite-flying to children's groups in various languages. This is because there are many Chinese children in the area who are very fond of this game. The construction of kites prohibits the use of metal wire. The company has also produced films demonstrating the danger of flying kites near electric wires and retrieving kites from electric cables. After the performance, each child is given a small booklet on kite-flying.</p>
<h3>Correction</h3>
<p>In the previous issue, in the article "The Press and Overdue Telephone Bills," on line 24... "particularly unwilling to improve business and increase the burden on the people," the printer mistakenly wrote "particularly willing to improve business and increase the burden on the people," which is the exact opposite of the intended meaning. Also, in "Reply to Mr. Koo from Shanghai," the printer mistakenly combined Mr. Kao's name. Corrections have been made.</p>

<h3>Fujian's Population Decreases by Ten Million</h3>
<p>— Zhen</p>
<p>According to a recent report from the Fujian Provincial Government Statistics Office, the population of Fujian Province has decreased from 20 million to 9 million, which means that in recent years, the population of Fujian has decreased by 55 percent. Of course, such a sharp decline in population is probably unprecedented in ancient and modern times, both at home and abroad. In the midst of the voices of national prosperity and national revival, this is truly a matter "worthy of attention."</p>
<p>Why? Because someone once said that our China is a declining and impoverished household. Because of this, on the one hand, family property has been unknowingly pawned off by our predecessors, and on the other hand, we comfort ourselves by recalling the past. On the one hand, we do not try to revitalize ourselves because of our "poverty," and on the other hand, we proudly boast of being the "gateway to the world," as if the golden age can never be forgotten. In the past, because of the aggression of the great powers, "Celestial Empire" and "Descendants of the Great Han" were our comfort; but the Celestial Empire was quickly dissolved under the attack of strong armor and sharp weapons, and "vast land and abundant resources" and "400 million compatriots" became our only reliance. Therefore, there is a popular "patriotic" theory these days: what does it matter if the enemy occupies all of China? The 400 million compatriots are still 400 million compatriots. Even if the Chinese nation is conquered, it is not a big deal. China is still China, our ancient civilization of Lu Palace spirit. We will always use this weapon to safeguard "peace," just like that kind of impoverished household, who still puts on the airs of a "noble family" when it is struggling to make ends meet. This famous theory believes that the reason why China will not perish is the illusion of "400 million compatriots" that we all have in our minds.</p>
<p>It is gratifying that this illusion is being shattered more and more each year. In the past few years, the drought in the Northwest was said to have killed tens of millions or millions, but the exact number is unknown. In the great flood of the 20th year that inundated a dozen provinces, the newspapers reported that this place became a watery country, that place was completely submerged, but only God knows how many descendants of the Great Han died. Last year's flood in North China, which spread across the Yongding River, the Yellow River, and the Huai River, we know about. The drought demon wreaked havoc in Jiangnan, and news from communications told us that people died one by one, family by family. But it is difficult to know exactly how many died. Recently, the kala-azar in Jiangbei has caused people to draw lots to decide who will die, and it is said that hundreds of thousands have already gone to the "Ten Temples of Yama." In addition, 36 million people have already become "overseas Chinese," plus the many "unnatural" deaths from being killed or committing suicide in recent years, I suspect that this "400 million compatriots" has already been discounted several times. The fact that Fujian's population has decreased shows that those of us who regard the 400 million people as the reason why China will not perish, and who use it as political capital, will not know what to rely on in the future.</p>
<h3>Illusion</h3>
<p>— Qingfeng</p>
<p>What is that shadow?</p>
<p>Before, it was far away from me, like scenery in a fog, I couldn't see it clearly. Now it is gradually moving, gradually approaching me. Finally, it revealed its terrifying face and came before me.</p>
<p>Its color is black, its shape is heavy and enormous—like a mountain. Day and night, it presses on my shoulders, presses on my shoulders.</p>
<p>It has such a strange magical power that whenever I see it, I have to shiver, and I can't help but think of death.</p>
<p>When I am working, it blocks my hands, making me unwilling to do anything, until I put down my work, and then it leaves, but only a little. When I am walking, it lies across my path, and I can't help but retreat. So I lower my head, as if I am carrying hundreds of pounds on my shoulders, and I walk with difficulty, searching everywhere as if I have lost something. I can't hear when others greet me.</p>
<p>It makes me want to sleep all day long, but when I actually go to bed, I can't fall asleep. I keep my eyes open for a long time, staring at the ceiling, staring when it is bright, and staring when it is dark, until my head hurts, my face feels hot, and my ears are ringing.</p>
<p>Its name is "Life."</p>
<p>When my friends see me, they always say: "Are you sick?"</p>
<p>I say: "Yes, I have a little illness."</p>
<p>Actually, what illness do I have? It's just that black shadow that keeps bothering me. If that counts as a serious illness, then it can't be considered a minor illness. I have even really treated it as an illness and visited a doctor, but after I described my symptoms, the doctor always humbly declined. I had no choice but to find my own way, to find a prescription that could cure this strange disease. Until today, I have not been able to officially find it, although I have found a substitute medicine that contains poison: alcohol.</p>
<p>Indeed, yes, alcohol has a considerable effect on driving away that black shadow. When I am drunk, my head spins, my senses lose their function; for that moment, I am carefree. I cannot see its ferocious appearance, nor can I hear its roar like a tide. Its voice and shadow disappear in the water vapor and hissing wail like boiling soup evaporating from my brain. However, the time of being drunk is very short after all. And the side effects of this strange medicine are also very strange:</p>
<p>"The more confused, the more sober; the more I forget, the clearer I remember."</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>So when its power disappears, the outline of that black shadow becomes clearer, its weight becomes heavier, and my feelings of sadness and anger become deeper. Sometimes it makes me so sad that I want to laugh wildly, and so angry that I want to beg everyone for mercy. However, I have not done this yet, because I am still a weak person and do not want to be taken for a madman.</p>
<p>Alas, when will you say goodbye to me? You strange giant! I lack the ability to entertain you.</p>
<h3>Rain Alley</h3>
<p>— Si Quan</p>
<p>The gray sky seemed to be covering the tin roof of the police booth. The fierce wind, carrying sand and dust, blew through the alley opening in a tightening rhythm. The signboard of Xiangtai Exchange was swinging like a pendulum without stopping. Old Guan, an old man in his fifties, wearing reading glasses, moved the *like Eight Beauties Garden* up and down close to his glasses, examining it with almost the same seriousness as a hound sniffing for the scent of wild beasts.</p>
<p>A rickshaw stopped at the alley opening. A silver dollar *jing*ed loudly on the counter. Old Guan hurriedly threw away *Eight Beauties Garden* to welcome today's rare customer. As he picked up the silver dollar to examine it, he unconsciously noticed that the sky was darkening. So he looked towards the other side of the street over the upper edge of his glasses. There was a food stall over there. A group of rickshaw pullers were gathered under a bright electric light. He knew it was seven o'clock now.</p>
<p>After seeing the customer off, he switched on the five-light electric lamp. This was his time to balance the books every day. But today, seeing the few scattered silver coins on the counting board, he threw them all into the safe as if in a fit of pique, and locked it. Just as he was about to retrieve *Eight Beauties Garden*, the tall policeman stepped into the shop.</p>
<p>"Good business? — Damn, it's raining again!"</p>
<p>The sound of his voice seemed to fall into the shop at the same time as his one hundred and eighty plus pounds of weight. He reached over the counter with a backhand and skillfully pulled out a Golden Mouse brand cigarette. Old Guan habitually lowered his head and let it pass. Then, he slowly walked over and first looked towards the street. Raindrops were wildly splashing everywhere. His head did not protrude out of the counter, but his face reflected the light of the electric lamp. The fruit shop across the street was closing up. Ah Gen was busily taking down his stall under an oilcloth umbrella. The rickshaws had all dispersed. Only the increasingly heavy rain had beaten the street into a white mist.</p>
<p>"I only made a dollar or so today. Yesterday, the fruit shop came to exchange change. They said that no one wanted the bananas and oranges even when they were selling them by the pile! Chief, what do you say?"</p>
<p>"Damn!" That one skillfully held the cigarette in his mouth, apparently not hearing what Old Guan was mumbling. Unconcerned, he blurted out "Damn."</p>
<p>Old Guan walked back. The chief was still sympathetic to him after all, even though he was skimming a Golden Mouse brand cigarette every day. Wasn't he cursing out loud? Perhaps he had the power to forbid that "Red-Hair Devil" from opening shop! Thinking this, he grabbed the matches and politely struck one to light it for him.</p>
<p>"×*Them*! Across the street, their business is so good! Red-Hair Devil!"</p>
<p>That one understood what Old Guan meant. A new tobacco and currency exchange shop had opened on the other side of the road. The streetcar stop was right in front of their door. And it was large-scale with a wide variety of goods. Xiangtai's customers in this alley had almost all been snatched away. Old Guan used to do twenty plus dollars worth of business a day.</p>
<p>"Damn, their location is good!" That one took a deep breath. Two streams of white smoke shot out from his nostrils.</p>
<p>Old Guan took two steps back in disappointment. His back was blocked by the money safe. He watched the round stamp of the Golden Mouse brand burn away halfway. A puff of thick, *choking* white smoke concealed that enormous head. He turned his head. Outside the door was a sheet of rain, *whaling* down. Even the fruit shop was closed.</p>
<p>"Chief, there's no business on rainy days!" This was obviously an order to leave. Old Guan felt that this was the best way to retaliate. That one did not have time to reply. He shouldered the door panel inside the shop, making a *bumping* sound as he moved it like a young man.</p>
<p>The chief hesitated for a long time, finally tossed away the cigarette butt, put on his raincoat, and walked towards the police booth without looking back.</p>
<p>"Red-Hair Devil!" Old Guan closed the last door, his gaze landing on a crumpled *Eight Beauties Garden* on the ground, smeared with shoe prints.</p>
<h3>Rain's Memories</h3>
<p>— Hua Mu</p>
<p>Now, I have lost the joy of rain. Whenever it rains, my heart feels like it's stuffed with cotton, strangely uncomfortable, both heavy and empty. At this time, I often silently go to bed, carefully recalling the feelings of my childhood, and how active I was on rainy days.</p>
<p>When I was awakened by the sound of thunder in my sleep, the phosphorescent lightning flashed across the window lattices, and the earth-shaking thunder crashed down, making my heart beat. I hurriedly shrank my head into the quilt and nestled in my mother's arms. At this time, although I was scared by the thunder, I was secretly happy listening to the pattering raindrops on the roof tiles, always hoping that it would rain like this non-stop until dawn.</p>
<p>The next day, as soon as it was light, I excitedly ran outside barefoot. Wow, the streams and fields were full of water, rushing and gurgling. Countless white-winged water birds were flying and chirping all over the sections. I threw up my pants legs and ran onto the field embankments and stream banks, jumping and shouting, forgetting about breakfast. By the time my mother called me back, my clothes were already soaked.</p>
<p>In the hot summer, after the rice harvest was over, the adults hoped for a few heavy rains to cool down and to turn the soil for the second planting. When a gust of wind came in the afternoon, a black cloud covered the southwest corner, and dust and sand flew across the threshing floor in whirlwinds. At this time, I was often confined to the house by my mother. After the thunder started, the sound of rain came closer and closer. Looking through the bamboo curtain, I watched the longan trees in the orchard, drooping with heavy longans, swaying back and forth, shaken by the wind and rain, and one by one, the fruits fell off the stems and hit the ground with a *bobo dudu* sound. I was busy calculating. As soon as the thunder stopped and the rain weakened, how could I be the first to jump over the heavenly steps and turn the corner of the alley... Sure enough, before long, the cloud passed and the rain and thunder stopped. I happily ran back from the orchard with a small basket of longans and ate them in the corridor with my grandmothers, peeling them and laughing.</p>
<p>Sometimes it rained for three days in a row. The river water rose, and the small streams had nowhere to drain, so the rice paddies in the lower reaches became a large ocean lake, vast and misty, driving the snakes, large frogs, and crickets in the mud holes up to the field embankments in the upper reaches. Every day we went to catch large frogs and crickets in groups. If we caught a striped snake, we could sell it to the pharmacy. When the water receded, we would pole bamboo rafts to catch river carp...</p>
<p>As I grew older, I left my hometown and placed my life in the waves of wandering. The shadow of my hometown has gradually faded into the distance. Whenever it rains, I have different feelings, depressed, empty, and annoyed, no longer evoking pleasant feelings.</p>
<p>I sadly reflect that childhood has now disappeared!</p>
<h3>Jing Yuan</h3>
<p>— Tian Qi</p>
<p>Coming out of the door, the sky was just beginning to brighten. Jing Yuan raised his head and looked at the eastern sky, which was high and clear, and pure. Casting white light. The misty morning fog was dissipating from the fields, bordering the pine forest in front, which was dark and retained the shadows of the remaining night. Piles and piles of rice straw laden with full ears lay on the threshing ground. The dog was lying quietly there, hearing someone come and alertly lifting its head to stare with its four blank eyes. At this time, the courtyard also heavily sent out a long cock-a-doodle-doo, broadcasting it to the surrounding villages.</p>
<p>His father, with an oilcloth umbrella under his arm, walked in front, and his mother, carrying the luggage, followed behind. At this time, Jing Yuan's feet felt heavy, as if they were tripped by something. There were many things to say, but once they reached his throat, they were stuck by something. Looking at his father's back and then back at his mother walking with her head down, he felt a vague pain in his heart.</p>
<p>As they approached the bend in the pine forest road, Jing Yuan suddenly stopped and called out "Dad" to the front, turned around and looked at the house in front, and the rice straw piled up in the threshing ground, thinking that once he went to a foreign country this time, he didn't know when he would be able to come back. Although his father was still strong and able to do farm work, a year of sweating blood from head to toe still couldn't grow enough grain on the one piece of paddy field. How would the days ahead pass? The pain of separation and the worries of the future caused him a burst of soreness, and tears streamed down his face.</p>
<p>"Jing'er, from ancient times, the old heavens have not let down those who work hard. I always hope that when you get to a foreign country, you will have good luck, earn some money and come back in three or five years..."</p>
<p>His mother said as she put down her luggage, wiping her tears with the corner of her clothes as if something was stuck in her throat, and continued to say.</p>
<p>"Mom can put everything out of her mind, but she can't believe that she has worked hard all her life and still can't get you a wife before letting you go to a foreign country thousands of miles away to find a living."</p>
<p>His mother was sobbing, and at this time Jing Yuan's heart felt as if countless sharp needles were stabbing at his heart. His father stood in front, looking like he was wiping away tears as well.</p>
<p>"Mom, I will be a good person when I get to a foreign country, but I can't bear to see Mom and Dad suffer at home..."</p>
<p>"Stupid son, although Mom and Dad are old, we can still work and eat, it's just..."</p>
<p>"I told Dad before that the interest on Yijing Gong's loan will eventually add up to more interest, so it's better to simply mortgage the field to him, and cut it off cleanly. But Dad always says he can't bear it, that if you give it to others, there will be no field to cultivate."</p>
<p>"That's right, there's only this small field. Once it's mortgaged to others, where will we get our porridge every day?"</p>
<p>"Anyway, we can't grow three *volumes*, so it's the same to go hungry whether we mortgage it or not. Mortgaging it will save us from paying interest. Mom, you should still tell Dad to mortgage it. I'll send money back after I finish my first year as a 'new guest'."</p>
<p>As Jing Yuan said this, things seemed brighter in front of him. He understood that this time he was leaving home, crossing the ocean to a foreign country, and that in two or three years he would be able to return in glory and revitalize the family business. Thinking of this, he turned around and urged his mother to hurry on their way.</p>
<p>"Dad. Mom, I'll send money back after I finish my first year as a new guest."</p>
<p>When the ship was leaving, Jing Yuan stood on the deck and spoke to his father and mother, and tears rolled down again.</p>
<h3>Fish Village Vignette</h3>
<p>— Tuoren</p>
<p>Although it's only a dozen or so *li* from the town to the fishing village, it takes more than an hour to travel there. This is because it's not a smooth road, but a rugged, uneven mountain path.</p>
<p>I've traveled this road three times now, but I still can't remember it clearly. When I encounter branching paths, I still have to ask the locals. Luckily, after turning over a mountain ridge, I met someone else going to the fishing village. He was a clerk from a large fish shop in town. He walked with me, seemingly understanding my hardship, and slowed his pace considerably. As we walked, we started talking.</p>
<p>"How's business lately? I heard the fish shops did well last year," I started.</p>
<p>"Business isn't always good; it depends on the weather and luck. Last year wasn't very good. It's not like it used to be. A load of fish has to pass through so many levies; what's good about that?" He seemed to fear I didn't believe him and looked at me.</p>
<p>"I understand that fishing depends on the weather, but why does it depend on luck?" I asked.</p>
<p>"You outsiders don't understand; luck is very important. If your luck is bad, even if you're on the same team of boats going out to sea, others will return with full holds, while you'll come back empty. Sometimes you'll even encounter storms! Do you believe that? Even the boss relies on luck."</p>
<p>"Hmm."</p>
<p>The stone fragments and sand on the rough road rolled into my shoes, forcing me to take them off every few steps to avoid blisters. But the porters, each carrying dozens of *jin* of fish, barefoot, didn't seem to feel the pebbles rubbing against their skin. They still ran quickly, which made me admire them and feel my own weakness and incompetence.</p>
<p>Besides the fish porters and villagers, few people travel this road. Someone like me is only here occasionally. As for the town's bosses or the village's police officers, they usually travel this road by sedan chair. Even the tax bureau staff or patrol soldiers rarely walk.</p>
<p>The road gradually became smoother. Passing through the valley entrance, it became a small mud road. On this road, besides the high mountains, there's hardly an acre of farmland. It wasn't until we walked out of the valley entrance that fields appeared on both sides of the road.</p>
<p>"It's been a few years since I've been here; it's definitely changed," I thought as I entered the fishing village. My legs, numb from walking, slowed down heavily.</p>
<p>In this village, named for its fish production, the people hadn't changed. Every strong young or old man was still bare-backed on the beach, carrying the fish that had been arduously caught in the fierce winds and waves. The women and children were still barefoot on the sand, picking up the discarded small fish to take home for food. The sea hadn't changed either. The surging tides still seemed like giant wolves, mouths open, waiting to swallow the adventurous fishermen. The streets, muddy and damp streets, the houses, the crumbling ruins of fishermen's homes, everything was as old and decrepit as before. Only the new building by the coast, the tax bureau with its large sign, stood tall amidst the aged ruins. Loads of fish, adding to the burden, were sent out from the back door of the tax bureau. The fishermen's blood and sweat, their harvest gained by risking their lives in fierce winds and waves, were stamped with a red seal, and load after load, became the property of others, sent to the city.</p>
<p>The fish in the baskets jump lively year after year, but the fishermen are crushed year after year under the red seal.</p>

<p>Qi Lu Zheng Person's Promise</p>
<p>Sharing adversity is easy, sharing benefits is difficult. Adversity is something that everyone possesses. Benefits are what everyone desires. Sharing fear makes people unite. Sharing desire makes people compete. From ancient times to the present, changing intimacy to estrangement, changing favor to resentment, rarely occurs without sharing benefits. I observed the Three Kingdoms' attack on Xu, how well they managed the relationship between merit and benefit. During the attack on Xu, the first to climb the walls were the Zheng officials, while the Qi and Lu officials did nothing. The last to climb were the Zheng soldiers, while the Qi and Lu soldiers did nothing. Therefore, the merit of conquering Xu belonged solely to Zheng. Returning Xu to Zheng would be natural. However, it is a common human sentiment to avoid danger and stay behind during battle, and to compete for benefits and stay in front during victory, without shame for one's own lack of merit, but intolerant of others' merit. In the past, Deng Ai and Zhong Hui together attacked Shu. Ai pacified Shu and killed him. Wang Jun and Wang Hun attacked Wu. Jun pacified Wu, and Hun imitated him. If the rulers of Qi and Lu had been like Zhong Hui and Wang Hun, it would have been a disaster for the Three Kingdoms. Xu, though small, was an ancient state. One rabbit in the wilderness, a hundred people chase it. One gold in the wilderness, a hundred people compete for it. How much more the benefits of a state?</p>

<h3>Breaking Harmful Superstitions: Roger Pryor's Strange Behavior</h3>
<p>— Suyin</p>
<p>Roger Pryor said, "You point out a superstition to me, and I can break it as easily as popping a blister. I am the only actor who whistles in the dressing room. I often throw my hat on the bed. I see ladders every day and unhesitatingly walk under them. Lighting three cigarettes with one match is my specialty. I have broken more mirrors in my life than all the actors in Hollywood combined. When walking on the street with friends, I love to walk around lampposts. Umbrellas are often opened indoors in my house. I always put on my left shoe first every morning. My favorite number is thirteen."</p>
<p>The above is the advice of a Hollywood newcomer, Pryor, regarding the superstitious beliefs of movie industry workers. He said, "The movie industry is the most superstitious of all industries in the world. Not every movie industry worker is deeply superstitious, of course. A black cat crossing their path may not surprise them. But if you're looking for a movie industry worker who has no superstitions at all, that's a very difficult task."</p>
<p>Pryor is a newcomer in Hollywood, but he is a veteran on the stage. His father was a band conductor, and he learned to play more than ten instruments from a young age. He became a stage star in New York even before Lee Richman. Now Universal has recruited him. We will be able to hear his singing voice in many musicals in the future.</p>
<p>He said that he had been a most superstitious person since childhood. Whenever he said anything, if he encountered anything with an unlucky meaning, he would strike his knuckles on wood, knocking his finger bones until they hurt. On the first day of every month, when he woke up in bed, he would definitely shout "Rabbit" first. He would rather lose an arm than say any other word at the beginning of the month. But later, a friend of his father's, seeing the child being so pitifully superstitious, began to advise him, using many things to prove that various superstitions were incorrect. But he still didn't believe it. Later, he used years of secret observation to finally determine that all superstitions are based on unconscious fear. Therefore, he began his work of breaking superstitions, especially among actors on the stage or screen.</p>
<p>He said, "Performers or actors are a special class of people, so they have special habits and superstitions. Often, things that ordinary people don't pay attention to, they value and avoid. But this kind of superstition is most harmful among actors. I have a colleague whose age and ability are the same as mine. He once got a cold, which caused him to lose a very good performance opportunity. After he recovered, he suddenly remembered that he had broken a mirror before he got sick. According to the common saying, breaking a mirror means seven years of bad luck. Therefore, he was sad and remorseful, thinking that his whole career was over. Although he was an educated person, he accepted his fate and no longer sought to improve. This alone is enough to show how harmful superstition is. This is also the beginning of my determination to fight against superstition."</p>
<p>According to Pryor's experience, thirteen is his lucky number. The first time he went on stage, there were only twelve audience members, but later there were more and more, and he performed for four consecutive weeks, and his reputation rose. When he went to roulette, he specialized in betting on thirteen and often won a lot of money. His latest musical began on the thirteenth. He arrived in Hollywood also on the thirteenth.</p>
<p>As for whistling in the dressing room, that is the most taboo thing for actors. They say that an actor whistling in the dressing room can cause the theater to catch fire, or cause the curtain to fall, or at least he will be fired. But Pryor was once assigned a role that he did not want to play. The theater manager wouldn't allow him to change it, nor would he allow him to resign. He had no choice but to start whistling in the dressing room, waiting for the superstition to be confirmed, or for him to be fired. But he performed for five consecutive months and was not fired. From then on, he whistled in the dressing room every day.</p>
<p>Pryor said, "I have unintentionally broken many of my colleagues' superstitions, but unintentionally, I have also lost many friends. Once, at a banquet, I knocked over a salt shaker on the table. According to the rules, I should grab a handful of salt and throw it over my left shoulder backwards, otherwise something unfortunate will happen. A female guest sitting next to me watched me, waiting for me to do it as prescribed. But I knew it and didn't do it. The female guest was so horrified and scared, as if the imminent disaster would affect her as well. This is the most superstitious woman I have ever met in my life."</p>
<p>Pryor's motto is: "Forget fear. Break superstitions. Otherwise, you will only bring trouble on yourself."</p>
<p>Film Commentary</p>
<h3>Review of "Secret of the Chateau"</h3>
<p>— Hualun</p>
<p>Secret of the Chateau, Shown at Da Shanghai</p>
<p>This detective film, "Secret of the Chateau," is similar to "Mysterious Clock," directed by Lambert Hillyer and starring Ralph Bellamy, which was shown in Nanjing two months ago. The latter's murder case centered on a dispute over inheritance, while this is for stealing an ancient edition of the Bible. However, the approach of relying on a kind of absurd legend under a mysterious guise to increase suspicion, shift and confuse the audience's attention, in order to facilitate the performance of an empty script is exactly the same.</p>
<p>In this era of increasing murder and robbery cases, along with social unrest and the increasing level of decadence in the lives of some people, the continuous production of detective films is inevitably due to their objective conditions. But at the same time, due to the progress of lifestyles, the actual murder and robbery cases and methods are also very different from the past. Now that everyone is competing to use science and technology, the filmmakers are still haggling over the use of mysterious guises, running a carousel-style production of this kind of film in absurd legends, which is a bit too old-fashioned, isn't it?</p>
<p>Here, it is written that not long after the death of a nobleman in an ancient castle, those with inheritance rights invite friends to discuss the distribution and evaluation of the estate one evening. Suddenly, the ancient clock on the castle tower rings automatically. In the family's terror, the estate manager is killed, and a valuable Bible, one of the heirlooms, is also lost at the same time. When the case has just begun to unfold during the investigation, the criminal is caught. But immediately, the case is diverted by the murder of the hostess, and the case falls back into a cloud of bizarre incomprehensibility. Naturally, the so-called "monster" is finally captured, allowing the criminal, who was considered the murderer, to fall into the arms of a lover as a blessing in disguise. This is also the inevitable ending of this kind of story.</p>
<p>It is not easy to make such a common and cliché story into a successful work. Here, the director, in addition to explaining the story, has managed to achieve some success.</p>
<p>First of all, the atmosphere of suspense is fully arranged. Before the murder and theft occurred, each person involved had a suspicious point, had already been identified by the detective, and even Julie, the girl he had introduced, was the most suspicious of all. Others, such as Meng, who looked like a thief in the auction house, and who tried to open and close the doors of the castle without making a sound when he was a guest, as well as the scolded and annoying male servant, and the professor who came and went in a hurry, all bore involvement. Although the author made the famous thief Lu Xian appear repeatedly in Julie's room beforehand, and had him come to find Julie after the incident and be arrested, intending to focus attention on him. In fact, this deliberate act, even before the murder of the hostess, Mrs. Longbi, due to his unreasonable act of voluntarily seeking out a fake wife, one can see who the so-called "monster" is. As for the girl Julie, due to her passionate love when she met Paul—the young master, the artist—her expression of weariness towards her accomplice Lu Xian, her exclamation when the gunshot of the murder of Batu rang, etc., are enough to release her from the greatest suspicion—she is a book thief sent by Detective Ren and Lu Xian, and just a moment before the incident, she clearly went out with a fake key and a gun—.</p>
<p>In short, the arrangement of the criminal atmosphere and the reversal-style unveiling are the better aspects of "Secret of the Chateau."</p>
<p>The visual transitions in scenes such as viewing the Bible and the sudden ringing of the bell are also quite commendable. Naturally, the atmosphere of horror and the dim light and shadows are common in detective films.</p>
<p>The acting is mediocre. Clark Williams as Paul doesn't have much to offer here. It is still Kland Todd who plays Julie, and Detective Marlowe who are better.</p>
<h3>Review of "Hitler Youth Storm Troopers Street Fighting Record"</h3>
<p>— Ping</p>
<p>The Storm Troope — New Light</p>
<p>We have almost nothing to say about this kind of film. Can we still find anything beneficial to our artistic cultivation in such an arbitrary propaganda film? We are not at all opposed to films having propaganda and educational significance, but we dare not agree with arbitrary propaganda. For example, in China today, anti-imperialist and anti-Japanese films have their own propaganda effect, because this is what the vast audience urgently demands. No one denies that this kind of film truly grasps the needs of the vast audience and has already determined its artistic value. However, arbitrary propaganda is not like this. Its only purpose is to exaggerate propaganda, even if it is not based on facts. It is like a strong morphine stimulant, injected into people's hearts through a long needle, forcing people to get excited, even if they don't need to be excited, they can't help but be passively excited.</p>
<p>It is very clear that after the National Socialist Party came to power in Germany, besides frantically preparing for war, or burning books, and expelling a large number of scholars or artists from the country, what good impression did it give us? Speaking of this, we cannot help but think of the great director Bertolt Brecht, the excellent actress Marlene Dietrich, and Konrad Veidt, who are still wandering abroad. The sorrow of these film artists is imaginable by righteous audiences. How terrible is the phenomenon of film art being directly subjected to cruel political interference!</p>
<p>As for technical observations, or talking about some filmmaking techniques, I don't think there is much need. Anyway, what appears here are actors who don't have much profound expression, and the director is only fulfilling the responsibility of arbitrary propaganda. These, in the eyes of the swastika party leaders of the tyrant, may have great achievements, but in the eyes of our foreign audience, it feels like a pointless waste.</p>
<h3>A Collection of Hollywood Anecdotes</h3>
<p>— Fu</p>
<p>Fred Astaire's Troubles - Fred Astaire, the dance expert in "You Were Never Lovelier," because he is a dance expert, he cannot enjoy the pleasure of social dancing. Because every time he goes to the dance floor, anyone who doesn't dance with him feels resentful. Therefore, he simply doesn't do social dancing anymore.</p>
<p>Jeanne Crain Absolutely Can't Get Married - Recently, a dentist from New York came to Hollywood. He was often with Jeanne Crain, so everyone rumored that Jeanne would marry soon. However, the dentist stayed in Hollywood for more than a month and returned to New York. After he left, Jeanne often went out with another person. So rumors started again. That person is an architect whom Jeanne met on the ship when she went to Honolulu. But why do people fabricate rumors just because she went out with a man a few times?</p>
<p>Jean Harlow is Getting Married Again - It is said that the person she is going to marry is the big star William Powell. Powell is currently building a new house, and people say that is their future new home. Powell recently lost his beloved dog and was very sad. Jean knew about it, so she found a largest St. Bernard type of English dog and gave it to him. Powell was very grateful and specially purchased an acre of land for that big dog and built a dog house for it.</p>
<p>Claudette Colbert's New Home - She is building a purely American-style country house. It is very strange that the bricks used in that house were given by fans - all of Claudette's admirers gave her a brick each. This was initiated by two fans. They heard that Claudette was going to build a house, so they specially made two bricks with their names on them and sent them to her. After this news spread, bricks from all directions were sent in various ways. So after the house is built, it can be called the "House of Ten Thousand People".</p>
<p>Movie Novel</p>
<h3>Elegy of Life (1)</h3>
<p>— Pei Yuan</p>
<p>Produced by Yi Hua Company, directed by Hu Rui, starring Li Minghui,</p>
<p>Wang Yin, Hu Ping, Wang Naiai, Qin Tong</p>
<p>Lin Mengou (played by Wang Yin) is an assistant professor at Nanfu University and also a researcher of opera art.</p>
<p>Liang Suqiu (played by Li Minghui) is a teacher working in a kindergarten in a small school and is a woman trapped in poverty.</p>
<p>Qiao Qiao (played by Qin Tong) graduated at the same time as Lin Mengou, but since graduation, he has been involved in unemployment. The fatigue of life makes him feel the dimness of the future.</p>
<p>The three of them live in the same apartment. They are neighbors and get along very closely.</p>
<p>It was a moonlit night, and Mengou stood alone on the balcony, facing the gentle evening breeze, playing a melodious song on his skillful violin towards the bright moon. At this time, Qiao Jie came in from outside, listening attentively. The same temple also attracted the attention of Suqiu in the next room.</p>
<p>After a song was over, the three of them gathered together to chat. During the conversation, Suqiu revealed the sigh of the school owing wages. Qiao Jie also uttered a lot of complaints about unemployment. Mengou comforted them with witty remarks.</p>
<p>Zhao Manna (played by Hu Ping), a school beauty at Nanfu University, is also Mengou's student. She is very beautiful and very lively, so her beauty and liveliness are deeply imprinted in Mengou's mind. Although they are teacher and student, Mengou loves her very much.</p>
<p>While Mengou, Suqiu, and Qiao Jie were talking and laughing, Manna ran over excitedly. She came to invite Mengou to a party at Liu Rong's (the son of a banker, also a student at Nanfu, played by Wang Naidong) house tonight, and at the same time she stated that she would also go tonight. When Mengou heard that she was also going, he excitedly agreed.</p>
<p>That night, many guests came to Liu Rong's house, which was exceptionally lively and happy. The purpose of Liu Rong's gathering tonight is to gather everyone's strength and organize a theater troupe; and he has an attempt to organize a theater troupe, which is to occupy Manna, because he also loves Manna and is pursuing Manna.</p>
<p>Mengou did not know that Liu Rong had such an attempt, and came happily. Everyone stepped forward to greet him with greetings. During the banquet: Liu Rong stood up and said: "Every holiday, students always scatter; this year I want to start a drama club to contact each other, so I specially invited Mr. Lin over." Then; Manna also stood up and said: "Especially this year, I heard that the school will be closed down next semester due to economic reasons." (To be continued)</p>
