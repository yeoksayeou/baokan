<h3>美國對華政策之歧途</h3>
<p>— 星野</p>
<p>自吾國經濟及金融之恐慌開始之後。對日外交。漸有急轉直下之勢。列強之在遠東有利益者。莫不倉皇失措。籌思對策而諸國之中。最感煩悶與躊躇者。以吾人度之。殆莫美國若。據華盛頓電傳。美國外交次長菲列浦已與英國駐美大使林特賽。于中國問題有所商洽。擬根據九國公約。重組國際銀團。俾中國渡過目前經濟及金融之難關。而不至有饑不擇食之苦。吾人當此進退維谷。前有猛虎後有深淵之境。固不必蓄何種奢望。亦不必存厚此薄彼之心。然事至今日。對于美國之無確定的遠東政策。只顧目前。不思久遠則良不能無遺憾也。</p>
<p>美國於遠東之對華政策。人皆知其為門戶開放與領土保全。然此非政策。僅口號耳。蓋若推行一國之政策。固應因地因時而加以修正。然根本精神所在。必不惜傾全力以赴之。日本之推行其大陸政策。英國之推行其蘇彝士政策。莫不如是。惟美國政府。則因狃于傳統之孤立主義及門羅主義。並以地理上國力上之優勢為可恃。對于一種對外政策。往往虎頭蛇尾。或口惠而不實施。其提倡國際聯盟。其主張召集倫敦經濟會議。其提出不承認偽國之主張。其對于巴黎和約之「過事恊商」一點之解釋。每使理論與事實相違。主張與行動相背馳。而使世界各國。對于美國之是否能「貫澈始終」亦常發生懷疑。</p>
<p>中國圖自存于東亞。固只有自助自奮之一途。然為中國之友邦者。若無領土及政治之野心。則應如何認識富強之中國為列強利益之最佳保隙。申言之卽如何使中國得早日實現眞正之統一。積極建設。使中國人民之生活標準提高。購買力加強。以達其利人而利己之目的。乃各國往往目光不遠。雖有九國公約之條欵。保證中國得有自與之機會。然為眼前利益。每不惜犧牲將來之收穫。正如世俗所謂圖鵝之金卵。而殺其鵝。日本之佔我東北四省。固不待言。卽蘇俄近亦垂涎于新疆。法國于中法越南條約。遲遲不肯讓步。亦莫不如此。而最使吾人感覺失望者。以中國素認為良友之美國。亦強持其白銀政策。使中國經濟困難。日益尖銳化。而其于維持「門戶開放」主張之無熱誠。其與列強合作之不努力。每使吾人懷疑美國外交當局。是否有一貫之主張與基本之態度。</p>
<p>今遠東問題。離總解決之期或已不遠。美國人民。應有或向前或退後之決心。而無彷徨歧路之可能。孤立政策在經濟相互依賴之今日。勢難持久。明于世界大勢者莫不知之。遠東之列強合作。本為比較的有實行可能性。且較合子和平方向之辦法。而列強合作。往往唯美國之馬首是瞻。蓋美國為九國公約之主動者。其國力較英法俄為強。其在遠東之將來希望。亦較歐洲諸國為大。假如美國當局。誠能認淸彷徨歧途之失策。只圖目前苟安之非計。則應及早確定其方針。鮮明其態度。而對於遠東問題。第一步改變其白銀政策。免中國經濟金融之陷于困境。第二步于九國公約原則下。積極領導各強國。予遠東問題以一個切于實際之解決。此不但世界和平之所賴。亦美國利益之所在。賢明之美國政府當局。其三思之。</p>

<h3>西北視察記</h3>
<p>— 本報特約記者賡雅</p>
<p>概述新疆今年變亂之經過（六）</p>
<p>新疆於四一二政變後所誕生之新政府、不久卽將有二週紀念之慶祝、迴顧其過去一年半之歲月、可謂無日不在風雨飄搖之中、今彼新政府之新生命、已漸入佳境、亦卽督署盛世才一人所攬政軍大權、已日見其鞏固之徵象、然新政府之得有此新生命、眞由所謂「締造艱難、經營慘淡」得來、蓋彼新政府自誕生以來、不僅外有唯一大對頭之馬仲英、與彼兵戈相見一年餘、而彼新政府內部中心人物之互相傾軋、亦殊有一波未平一波又起之概、至於曇花一現、幾成孿生雙長之南疆獨立政府、其耐尋味之小史、尚不與焉、南疆纏民鐵米爾等、在喀什突樹獨立政府之旗幟、關內所傳對彼自生自滅之消息、紛紛不一、然哈密有曾與彼互通聲息之纏民、則謂」被政府之成立、不過擬在中央政府之指導下、求達新疆人民自洽自主之目的、該政府領袖鐵木爾嘗有「一個尚未健壯之幼駒、驟然離家遠逸、若遇野狼、必被膏其吻也無疑、是知新疆人民尚决不能完全離開中央政府之懷抱提携、別求富有危險性之生存途徑」之語、故該政府所新鑄之銅幣、印有中國國民黨黨徽、所樹新幟、亦配戴中國國旗於其上、此事實非虛傳、蓋該政府所持態度、所含意義、實可於此大白」云云該政府早經消滅、經過情形、已散見各報、今聆上言、更可得其大要矣、</p>
<p>楊增新有言、古語「西出陽關無故人之故字、應易為好字、新人亦云、新省治世是桃源、亂時是絕地、前者乃楊多年治新經騐之談、後者係由觀察地理所得、皆各有其客觀上之適切性、足見新省人事複雜、環境特殊、有非內地可比、前文所述山纏之變、盛馬之戰、今所欲記之新政府要人、屢次傾軋之眞相、似皆不能逃其準繩也、</p>
<p>新政府內部之傾軋、除廿二年六月間、陶明樾李笑天陳中等、醞釀所謂「二次政變、」已見前文外、此後繼續暴露者、尚有倒盛之二大組織、從事此種活動之人、多係平素與盛有鄉誼戚誼之親信、而新政府堂堂首任主席之劉文龍、亦在其內、此無怪局外人引為駭異、卽盛初亦百思莫解也、</p>
<p>首次暴露倒盛之組織、時在廿二年十月間、主要份子、為前救國軍首領（時充迪化城防司令）鄭潤成、自衛軍首領楊耀鈞、軍股廠廠長李丹初、汽車局長格米力克等二十五人、劉文龍卽在其中、傳陶李陳二次政變時、劉曾參與其事、乍聞陶等槍决之耗、為之失色良久、惟劉等為主席、盛未便處置、僅將其豢養之歸化軍、設法拉攏過來、劉無以自處、厚禮請聯蘭譜、盛皆婉辭不受、此次劉又參加、知盛巳得線索、反先秘告主謀人名、詎盛當出名單一紙、劉亦赫然蓋戳其上、嗣按圖索驥、諸人被禁畢、省府遽以劉請病假、由財廳長朱鳳樓代主席聞、</p>
<p>劉請病假後、初被軟禁於省府之三堂、該處本為前主席金樹仁燕居之所、設備華麗、器物名貴、價值二十餘萬元、金隻身出走、劉卽携眷入住、事發後、卽由「逆產淸理委員會」派員前往點查物件、劉尚竭力抗拒、且臥地高呼、謂「你們無理如此、難道要逼我的老命麽」、然終被迫、遷回私宅、劉歷任南疆八城肥缺、宦囊充裕、居常兼營商放欵、在伊黎塔城、牧羊十萬餘頭、馬仲英之將圍迪化也、衆議速移官糧於城、劉反對未果、後城被圍、糧價飛漲、劉乃從容開其私倉、善價而沽、其工於聚財如此、故衆傳家藏白銀、在百萬以上、然皆為淸委會所代理矣、其他被淸理之「逆產」尚多、中以金樹仁（金主新五年所蓄、多為名貴古董）陶明樾張培元崔肇基·諸人最為豐富、其豐富之由來、殆非搜括莫辦也、又南疆各縣之纏變、漢官民之被難者固多、然據是役脫險者談、眞正淸廉愛民之縣長、特蒙另眼看待、實未玉石俱焚、悖入悖出、古有名訓、收民者、當知自處矣、</p>
<p>廿三年上半年、軍隊大部開往南疆、擬收拾馬之餘部、幷鎭懾各物、盛本人亦未輕離迪化、尚稱平靜無事、惟至九月間、素稱「第二督辦」之新省銀行總經理蘇上達、忽爾被逮下獄、空氣突又緊張、株連者計有建設廳科長金某、汽車局長劉某、童子軍隊長陳某等六人、案情迄未公佈、外間傳說紛耘、有謂蘇等秘密買槍、圖謀刺盛事洩者、有謂此係留日（盛為代表）留美（蘇為代表）兩派人物暗鬥之結果者、據無綫電台長王國光語人、謂盛蘇私誼、實無間言、惟政見不同、故迫而出此、然無論如何、其為反盛則一耳、</p>
<p>綜觀新省四一二政變、陶李陳槍决、劉文龍被軟禁、張培元攻省、蘇上達被捕五事、新人恒相提並論、稱為「五次革命」、當第五次事變暴露時、現任主席李榕（朱鳳樓又已辭職）曾與盛商發晉關護照、俾異己者得以自便、一時官民踴躍請照、最後一次由迪化直接東開之新綏汽車三輛、（以後則由綏通至哈密）客票於十數日前卽已售罄、迪哈途間、哈薩殺人行刧、由迪化至吐魯番、短短六站路程、僱大車出價二十萬票兩、（約合現洋四百元）猶無敢應命者、東行七角井一帶、則更須一請哈薩兵護送、其他間有騎駝者、數尤寥寥、未幾、停發護照之令又下、故東歸得至哈密者、卽互以「生入玉門關」相慶幸、</p>
<p>現在新省內部之局勢、一因馬仲英張培元等反對派之實力、巳先後消滅、二因新省府對各族（尤其纏族）領袖、優加任用、如省府副主席·各廳副廳長·各區行政長·及督署師旅長等、均有各族充任、頗能覊糜人心、四一二革命紀念日、盛氏有言、「新省情形特殊、軍事計劃實現、政治方有保障、」今就大體言、新當局確已辦到結束軍事、集中權力之地步、從此若不受外力之影饗、或意外之變動、一面更努力建設、重視各民族間之利益、則前途未可量也、</p>

<h3>點滴</h3>
<p>— （范樹深）</p>
<p>張鐵口說：「明年鴻運高照，財喜臨門。」李鐵口說：「三日內必有大禍，往西北方避之則大吉。」不過依我想來，如果顯能趨之，禍能避之，那末，生長在世界上的，一定都是有福之人。</p>
<p>有人說；如果以禽獸比喻人類，那末，有的像威嚴的獅子，有的像勇猛的虎豹，有的像狡猾的狐狸，有的毒如蛇蝎，有的美如孔雀，有的識時務的，像鴻雁燕子，……　　有人說：如果以植物比喻人類，那末，有的人像耐寒的梅竹，有的像常綠的松柏，有的像依附別的樹木上的藤類，有的像帶刺的玫瑰，……可是，一種種植物或是動物能够生長在世界上，至少有些功用；然而有祇吃飯不做事的人，將以比喻那一種動物或是植物呢！</p>
<h3>夫妻老少縱橫談</h3>
<p>— 易生</p>
<p>夫婦配合，若能年齡相仿，在生理上和日常生活都得「旗鼓相當」地調和。但因愛力的驅使或其他特殊關係，兩性間的年齡大相懸殊得成配偶，也是情理中應負的事。從前，像晋文公娶齊姜，劉先主入贅東吳，歷史上有不少著稱的事件可作先例。在民間，這種事更和家常便飯相似，不值得大驚小怪。就像年前某名律師和某名媛的婚姻，妻長夫幼，聽說是多份出於咸思知己；那時，也並沒有誰議論着什麽。今年熊希齡和毛彥文結婚，把老夫配少妻，同屬在社會上有地位的人，却事出偶然，大受社會注意和批評了！</p>
<p>最近，還有一位在萬里外六十歲的印度老伯伯，沒幾天便要和一個十三歲的少女結婚了。那位印度聖人甘地知道了大為反對，預備教他的信徒們加以抵制。在三年前，曾有同樣事件發生，甘地教徒弟們組成送喪儀仗，沿路相送；這項行動太有點幽默意義了！要是那結婚的老人一方見機而作，先發制人，自備棺　相隨，表示要和他或伊的耄年的前途輿襯决一死戰，恐怕甘地也沒奈何咧！</p>
<p>甘地為維護人道主義，纔不惜招人家怪怨：不過他太會惡作劇了，可算是一位聖之時者。照這樣看來，做老人還是做中國老人——最好做中國的老翁，得沾穩做老新郎的便宜；在鰥寡孤獨四種無告窮民中佔上一個「鰥」字，從前得為王政所矜，——就據熊氏婚後自白——現在也總不致有人實行搗蛋呢。</p>
<h3>煙包逸話</h3>
<p>— 鄭逸梅</p>
<p>香煙之在我國，已有數十年之歷史，我友錢化佛素不吸烟，却喜藏香烟盒包，兼收並蓄，蔚為大覜，黏之於冊，纍纍若干帙，且匠心獨運，彙集有方，如將世界牌與和平牌，合為世界和平，中央牌與委員牌，合為中央委員，又合孫中山，紫金山，萬壽山，馬占山，萬寶山五牌，為五岳圖，亦見巧思，又白鳳牌盒面為一雞，狗牌為一狗頭，詢之則曰：此雞鳴狗盜也，又一頁上黏日本所出之某烟盒，下則強盜牌及長城牌，曰：此亦稍有寓意，然意殊顯豁，不難猜測也，最為吉兆者，合黃金牌，如意牌，長樂牌，大豐年牌，四種為一頁，見之令人色然而喜，是眞善頌善禱者矣，其他如品海牌，旁註光緒二十五年出品，每盒價十六文，脚踏車牌，光緒三十二年出品，每盒十八文，黃包牌，宣統三年出品，註俗稱黃包車牌每包五枝，售五文，觀此更足以見物價今昔之懸殊，又鳳鳴牌，盒面繪一彩鳳，據云，為民國二年洪武烟公司出品，柏烈武所創辦者也，今巳絕跡於市上矣，化佛更指白金龍牌日：此章太炎所喜吸之烟也，老刀牌日：此天虛我生所喜吸之烟也。美麗牌曰：此鄭曼陀與黎錦暉所同嗜者也，他如游藝家之與金字塔，勞働家之與金鼠牌，皆若有密切不解之緣者。則吸烟之好尚，可覘其人之地位與品性。蓋化佛有心人，觀察有得之言也。爰作逸話以紀之。</p>
<h3>小竊</h3>
<p>— 茱英</p>
<p>這一回，我們弄裏的張先生家，捉到了一個小竊。這個小竊，是在下午五時半，天色垂暮時，掩進了張先生家半開着的大門，偷了一件毛葛馬褂，一伴夾大衣，正想溜走時，給張先生撞見，便給一把抓住了。</p>
<p>「張先生家捉住了一個小竊」的聲浪，登時俾遍了全弄。人聲是那麽的嘈雜，都趕上張家門口去瞧熱鬧。我為好奇心所驅使，也擠上去想一觀究竟。走到張家門口，只見那小竊跪在張先生面前，打着　，只是碰頭。</p>
<p>張先生見了我，點頭招呼，於是我擠上一步，向那跪在地上的小竊，瞥了一眼，倒不禁嚇了一跳，因為那小竊，竟是在三年之前，曾和我做過貼隣的余桂生呢。於是我不禁脫口而出的問道：「余桂生，你怎的幹起這種事來了？」　　那小竊聽我提他的名字，對我怔了一怔，才記起了我來，便雙液直流的說道：「先生，唉，我自從工廠倒了之後，一直到現在，四個年頭了，沒找到工做，我的老娘，老婆，孩子，也都間着三四年。吃盡當光，無法可想，才幹這勾當。幹了三次，沒失過風。今天給捉且了，求你先生給方便方便，若是要送到行裏去，我一家子得活活餓死了。」　　我聽了，有些惻然。張先生見是我認識的，便也不再想送捕究辦了。余桂生忙便又爬在地上對我同張先生碰響頭。接着，一條瘦瘠的黑影，便在烏黑的弄口消逝了。</p>
<p>我回到家裏，自己覺得眼裏有些兒濕潤。</p>
<h3>同病相憐</h3>
<h3>御香縹緲錄</h3>
<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>我從轎簾的隙縫裏低頭下視，只見地上舖着的黃沙，很快地在往後面退去，也可見我們的轎子是行得怎樣的快了。便使我回想到十幾天功夫以前，我們打宮中出來，從這條黃沙路上到車站去的時候，我們的興緻是何等的高啊？彷彿還是昨天的事情！不多一會，我們已進皇城來了，城門分兩邊暢開着，絕不遲疑地把我們迎接了進去。</p>
<p>然而這裏却還不是我們的全程的最終點咧！太后是决不會就在這裏停留着的。雖然這裏確然是皇城的中心。內苑的深處，所謂中樞之地；但太后是一向不歡喜這個地方的！</p>
<p>「這裏是多麽的陳舊古陋啊！」有一次，伊曾經很顯明地表示過伊對於這座皇宮的不滿意。伊說：「除掉了許多的高大得不適當的房屋之外，簡直是空空洞洞的一無所有了！只要我們發出一極輕微的聲音，便會激起絕大的回聲；使我們聽了，立刻會毛髮悚然。便是那一所御花園，也是一些點綴都沒有；滿目全是高大陰森的老樹，旣無鮮艷的花卉，也沒有溫聲的和風。這個地方簡直是到處祇有一陣冷冰冰的死氣，絲毫的生趣都沒有！」</p>
<p>因為這個綠故，伊暮年的生活，十分之七以上是在頤和園中度着的。不過今天才從奉天回來，依理講，不能不先到宮中來走一遭：如果沒有這一種習慣上的拘束，伊出了車站，必然直接要上頤和園去了。（二六二）</p>
<p>小食譜</p>
<h3>家常飯菜</h3>
<p>— 朱</p>
<p>菜蔬的收藏　春天的油菜，到了杏樹著花的當兒，田野裏面，開得一片黃澄澄的，十分動目。這種油菜在剛剛抽條還沒有開花的時期，喚做菜心；是春天普通的菜蔬，輩煮素食，都甜的很覺可口。這種菜心，在嫩的時候，洗汰乾净，然後在鍋裏和水煮沸，取出晒在竹竿或繩子上，在太陽裏曬乾。這種乾的菜心，名叫「菜乾頭」，放在乾燥的瓦缸或鍋器裏，可以久藏不壞，這種菜乾頭在煮食的當兒，須先用沸水浸胖，然後才可著手烹調。還有菠菜和馬蘭頸，也可煮沸晒乾，收藏待用，吃起來凉凉的別有風味。</p>
<p>筍晡與甜笋　春季著名的菜蔬，笋當然是唯一的物品。笋的滋味，是鮮美可口，無論輩煮素食，都是鮮美爽口，津津有味。然而笋是時鮮，在二三月裏，固然鮮嫩，不過春光老去，笋亦揮解生葉，變成新竹，就將老不可食。所以笋的保藏，除了罐頭食品之外，蘇州人家也有幾種收藏的法兒。普通的約有兩種。先將笋切成細條，和醬油等煮熟，然後取出在太陽裏曬乾，還有一種，也是先將笋切做細條，和醬油糖一同煮熱，然後在太陽裏略略晒乾，就藏起待用。這種甜笋，都是嫩笋所製，鮮美異常。</p>
<p>臘肉與風魚　魚肉蔬菜，新鮮的固然鮮晚肥美，但醃臘的，却也別具風味。在年尾歲首，將新鮮的魚或肉，洗净之後，先用鹽醃一過，再在醬油裏浸一二星期，使醬油的鹹味，透入魚肉之內，然後取將出來，在太陽中曬乾，晒在屋簷下面透風的所在，可以久藏不壞，在吃的時候，可以隨割隨吃。因着這種魚或肉，旣經醬油浸透，肥的旣不油膩，瘦的更顏色鮮紅，彷彿火腿一般。臘肉在春笋上市的當兒，最為當令，和着鮮肉同煮，是淸明時節一味最時鮮的家常菜者。風鮮用酒燉食，其爽晚鮮美，眞不亞於南腿哩！</p>
<p>豆苗萵苣與蒪絲　豆苗是豌豆的籐苗，蘇州人呌「豌荳籐」，和蝦仁同炒，有相得益彰之妙。近年來已有製罐收藏，可以四季不缺。萵苣笋新鮮時拌食，淸爽可口，蘇州野味店和糖果店，將萵苣製成盤笋，綠綠的十分悅目。至於蒪絲，也是太湖特產，在淸明時期和雞絲同煮，鮮腴異常。不過罐頭收儲的，鮮味却遠遜了。</p>
<h3>小西天</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第十回　唐突女郎前露財選　覬覦墻隙裏為病傷廉</p>
<p>於是又接着道：我不過是把賈老爺的話轉一轉，肯與不肯，自然還在你娘兒兩個，難道還能勉強不？若說到你們家等了錢過日子，馬上有錢拿回去，有什麽不好。好在你已經是答應給賈老爺的了，又不是隨便的一個生人。譬方你現在答應了，依着你要挑一個日子，挑好了一個日子之後，你不還是要把姑娘送到這旅館裏來陪着他的嗎？早一點兒，我想這也沒有什麼使不得。他說着，便又向人嘻嘻的一笑。朱胡氏知道什麼，聽了介夫的話，前後翻着一想，覺得他的話也是有理。旣是答應把姑娘給人了，就早一點給人，有什麽要緊？只要能够把這堆洋錢拿回家去，許許多多的事情，也都可以辦完，姑娘留在這裏，人家也不搯了一塊肉去，頂多不過是算糊裏糊塗當了新娘子罷了。他心裏想着，眼睛向那堆銀元，不免偷看了好幾回，再又同頭看看姑娘。心裏一想，想着人都快要餓死了，還講什麼面子，譬如早幾年把姑娘賣了，不也是送到人家去了的嗎？便向介夫道；張老爺，我就是這樣把他留在這裏嗎？他雖是大着膽子把這話問了出來，可是他依然是膽怯的那聲帶顫動着說出來的，字也含糊不淸。（一五一）</p>

<h3>美棉下跌英棉訉不佳　—漢口棉市凋敝已極—</h3>
<p>美棉開題、因利物浦消息不佳、外商賣出、各月跌二至六磅音、惟同業仍限價買進、其後因總統羅斯福有重行談及通貨膨脹、及麥市與股市上漲、發生反動、買戶審愼、緣主要出路、乃本地操業者及紐奧崙帮、卒以白宮盤明政策不變、股麥下落、多頭了結、復行疲軟、商報館預佔本年度棉田為三一、四八〇、〇〇〇畝、收盤平疲、計現貨跌五磅音、期貨跌六至十磅音、英棉市况平穩、計現貨跌一點、期貨漲二點、印棉停市、原電錄左、（六日電）</p>
<p>又據孟買電、七日白羅溪花之開盤預測、為二百四十五羅比、較上日收盤跌一·五羅比、</p>

<p>漢口通信、本市棉花市况、日趨凋敝、至為可驚、各方銷塲竟告斷絕、市價較春節前每担狂跌一元二角、上市臨塲者僅申新廠一家、購河口產一百七十小件、合市秤一千六百三十担又六十斤、茲將近日行情列下、</p>

<h3>糧食　粉麥一致向下移</h3>
<p>粉市以洋麥報價、芝加哥跌二角零、坎拿大跌四分至二角左右、又兼金價回跌亦猛、故開價時、各月份均無形短去二分左右、本月份旋以浮空抵補、及現貨仍然緊軋、故人心軟後即穩、達期則客戶回出、浮空則翻多、跌度未狂、迨至下午開盤、本月份因客帮交易頗暢、市趨堅定、遠期則因金價　續下落、大部分市氣、依然不振、惟買賣雙方、在此舉棋不定之時、出入則均稀淡也、結果本月跌七釐半、四月份跌一分七釐半、五月份跌二分、六月份跌三分、七月份跌二分七釐半、八月份跌二分二釐半云、</p>
<p>麥市各月份交易、均見冷淡、以洋麥報小、金價亦以回低、人心當然鬆軟、不過小麥市况、雖與外滙亦有關係、但助者終須備有　貨、方屬正式買賣、與純　投機者究有分別、故上下午以拋售不暢、市氣祗呈平弱、跌度則有限也、結果三四月份各較小三分、八月份小三分、現麥市面、高貨尙屬隱固、中次平平、開山東　德宿州麥三元七角七分、蚌埠明光新浦福州麥三元七角半、內信大去二千五百包、申大去一千包云、</p>

<h3>中關薄稻略回數分</h3>
<p>（滬南）昨日各帮來源十餘號、（貸共二千餘石）銷塲雖屬平常、包胃未動、然因連日到稀、河下存積見空、人心稍平穩、故市色巳見轉定、各厚粳及薄稻價均無榮學、中關晚稻有回起數分者、杜尖及陰變元等各花色亦無上落、</p>
<p>（滬北）昨日河下各路來船約念餘號、市上各貨去　、白粳稍有交易、薄稻平常、羊杜尖交滯、白元問津者廖寥、市價白粳回漲一二角、薄稻緊起數分、其餘各貨與前相仿、</p>
<h3>大絞米售現三千包</h3>
<p>昨日洋米市况、依然挺俏、漢口九江長江一路、因有行家自行配裝、（約有三十萬包）故在市新交易巳少、惟本街內地反見活絡、已非日前之擯持壓價狀態、本街辦去西貢一三號四千多包、內地去三號西貢二千六百包、碎米二千包、暹邏三號五百包、小絞一千包、敏黨五百包、又大絞米三千包、尙係初次售開之現貨、價格當佳、售開九元二角、業中人或作為小絞三號次米也、昨日售價仍與前日相近、惟形勢甚佳、如今後去化再旺、或有步砌之希望也、客秈只由本辦街去湖南機紅米二百五十包、價十元零二三角、比之前市步砌一角云、</p>
<h3>黃豆乏上漲之力</h3>
<p>昨日黃豆市况、茲承上日之良好市態、但大勢不易上漲、原因購買力薄、價大即停、昨市外形平定、內實呈疲、計廠家辦去全河豆三車、價為三元六角半、內地採去歸德豆二百包、價為三元七角半、又去亳州豆二百餘包、價為三元五角至四角半、及頴州豆一百餘包、價為三元六角二、本街成交西城豆四百包、價做四元七角、沙市豆一百包、價為三元三角七、內地辦去漢口乍豆八百餘包、價自三元四角半至三角六分、</p>
<h3>糖市　本廠棉白回小二角</h3>
<p>昨日糖市、以關金略鬆、初為一七九零、後至一七八八、故趨勢轉平、公會划盤、二四粗砂白叫升一角、為十七元、但乏受乎、轉口貨四元九角半、成交二百五十包、關棧貨四元九角未成、八九號荷赤叫十三元、太古　B麥叫十八元、均未划出、本廠綿白、因前日激升過高、而昨日又逢關金轉鬆、是以回小二角、振裕一號十六元五角、二號十六元四角、三號十六元二角半、四號十六元一角、潮齊號貨正在報關中、尙有一部份手貨、暫守不售、以致昨無成交、</p>
<h3>南北貨　石碼桂圓稍有運到</h3>
<p>石碼桂圓、云冬因受泉州奧化貨湧到關係、價甚　宜、故久難合劃、通來中小粒存貨漸薄、價逐回好、碼圓亦可近　、查昨日　州輪入口已稍有運到、大約後日方可開盤云、</p>
<h3>油市　洪江桐油漲風已伏</h3>
<p>洪江桐油、自本埠春盤漲後、副洪每桶二十三元四角、形勢漸見穩固、迨至上週鎮江方面、新貨頭盤亦公議開出、合算價格與本埠所議春盤相彷、惟盤後似覺俏俐、現聞數未紮定、而市面已轉緊張、昨晚得鎭來電謂正洪濟昌和每桶須售二十八元、副洪一概停售、加增幾何、雖未明言、但弦外之音、巳可想見、以此而衝、恐非加起七八角不可、推其致漲之因、不外受白桐油影響、蓋自白桐油飛漲、洪桐油成本亦為之增加、各榨坊產額或因此而减少、故現在所到新貨、有居奇之可能、本埠副洪售盤最低限度恐在二十四元左右矣、</p>

<h3>「狗咬呂洞賓」</h3>
<p>— 寒峰</p>
<p>長樂鄭氏輯印「淸人雜劇」，收葉承宗（奕繩）雜劇四種。「孔方兄」一折，「是一本戲劇化的錢神論，以儒生金莖的獨唱，表白出錢神勢力的偉大，是憤世之作」（西諦釋語）。所謂錢神的勢力，是可以動鬼神的，金莖因而唱着：</p>
<p>天也是愛錢的，天錢星耀碧宵；</p>
<p>地也是愛錢的，古錢塘湧浙潮；</p>
<p>木也是愛錢的，楡錢兒春畫飄；</p>
<p>花也是愛錢的，金錢花顏色嬌；</p>
<p>馬也是愛錢的，金錢驄聲價高；</p>
<p>豹也是愛錢的，金錢斑性咆哮；</p>
<p>神也是愛錢的，擺金錢問六爻；</p>
<p>鬼也是愛錢的，化紙錢冥路燒；</p>
<p>文也是愛錢的，選靑錢顯俊髦；</p>
<p>武也是愛錢的，中金錢較射豪。</p>
<p>這一闋「後庭花」，是說明了錢爲人人所愛，動物所愛，鬼神所愛，「一日無錢怎麼了？」事實本是如此，因而葉承宗諷刺的結束道：「孔方父親呵，俺只在膝前倚靠，俺把你椿庭哀吿，」而說如果一日無錢，那便會：</p>
<p>釜少糧淘，　少柴燒，廚少嘉餚，樽少香醪；</p>
<p>朋友寥寥，親戚蕭蕭，妻子呶呶，奴僕嘵嘵；</p>
<p>有皮無毛，有肉無臕，便腹空枵，痴夢空勞；</p>
<p>心似油調，喉似烟焦，汗似瓢澆，眼似鈴搖；</p>
<p>挿翅難逃，疆口難饒，苦趣難消，活罪難熬；</p>
<p>借代無交，乞丐無豪，變賣無巢，質當無袍；</p>
<p>儘攅眉博不出半分毫，只落得乾焦燥。（靑歌兒！）</p>
<p>葉承宗的憤慨，於此可想。不過，他所恨的，重心似乎並不是這「錢」，而是爲官走動的「狗」，他寫作四折的「狗咬呂洞賓」，其目的大約在此，雖然他究竟不免於幻想，要點醒「狗」，使他們也能成仙得一道，靈性恢復，一同登仙。</p>
<p>故事如西諦所說：「以俗語狗咬呂洞賓，不識好人，點綴成文，而平度添出石介一人，以洞賓度介爲仙之事爲中心。「楔子說洞賓雲遊，路過泰山，雲端裏看見書生石有道，定意要超度他。第一折說洞賓作爲雲遊僧點化石介，要求他佈施修廟，而介這時是：</p>
<p>儘屋裏刷刮，也不過是殘篇斷剳；</p>
<p>儘肚裏　査，濟不得您堂前後厦；</p>
<p>儘口裏撲搭，當不得那根椽片瓦；（那叱令）</p>
<p>是連「這五臟祠沒處安挿」的。最後，洞賓便要求「淸話一宵，亦是緣分」。他覺得石介這個人，「名士習氣猶存，只此便是禍本。」第二折寫呂介次日到城中訪友回來，路遇夜巡官蔡奇和他「頗能咬人」的狗。呂介是「不衫不履山林性」慣的，並不理會，遂被他拿下。他恨極了，駡蔡奇道：</p>
<p>久聞名，纔識荆，止不過貓鼠公堂，火耗征徭，罰贖刑名。問老兄，有蔡京，除却這，有何德政，甚面顏與人爭競？（上小樓）</p>
<p>蔡奇「打他不得，說他不過，」呌狗把他咬傷，送到泰廟東廊裏去凍，預備凍死他。但是石介並不害怕，也不屈服，他一路上還是駡，直罵到泰廟：</p>
<p>難道說，泰山老母無靈聖，脚跟下容這蒼生。權威在手便把令來行，你放火俺不許張燈。（要孩兒）</p>
<p>第三折寫洞賓得知此事，再去點化，他先吩咐柳樹精：「石生受困，我欲點化蔡奇，恐其不悟，只到午時三刻，作起風霧，天日無光，蔡奇必然恐懼，石生方可得釋。」然後自去找蔡奇，想不到狗突然出來，把洞賓咬了，一直咬了多次。洞賓於是破口罵狗道：</p>
<p>呀！俺則見　　獰犬出朱扉，呈盡東人勢。狗呵，顱上胎毛未曾退，便張威……（小桃紅）</p>
<p>狗呵！待喫，有東西，道不得倉有餘糧飽是飢。兀自溝中多少流亡輩，偏你這殺才飽食無忌。……（調笑令）</p>
<p>使煞你狼心狗肺，大古人來善人欺。你便是神獒也遇彌明斃，逞甚麽狗見識，狗心機，痴迷！（禿厮兒）狗也仗人勢，似虎助狐威，笑桀犬將堯亂　吠，便是你狗黨施爲。（麻郎兒）</p>
<p>接着就是洞賓施法，威嚇蔡奇，把呂介放了。而這時的狗，却也變了樣，「看這狗呵，只見他乞憐搖尾，難道狗也有意轉心回。」第四折時間大概隔得很久了，呂介「中了狀元，官拜御史，衣錦還鄉」，他覺得「榮枯事，人怎曉，恍如身在邯鄲道。」而蔡奇，却苦惱萬狀，惟恐他要報私仇，忙把石介的舊居重加修整，以贖前愆。石介覺得可笑，反而責備他，「誰呌你來休坯俺石氏藏書舊草瓢，敢將俺小窗前梅花斫了！」當他看到狗也乞憐搖尾，便又唱：</p>
<p>昨日個舞爪張牙，搖頭擺尾，喬聲厮咬，恁樣逞粗豪。怎如今搖尾乞憐，垂頭喪氣，千般腔調，休承望將你輕饒。（甜水令）</p>
<p>洞賓這時便再來度石介，介也感到這回做官，是「逼入猢猻套」，習成傀儡交，空落得予尾翛翛」，於是「脫朝衣，換布袍，除寳帶，綰絲縧，着上芒鞋將靴拋，九陽巾換了，打扮的一仙標」（沽美酒），「再不入利名圈套，」把「狗」也連同的度了去。</p>
<p>全劇大概情形是如此。這很容易使人理會到，作者葉承宗是一個具有滿腹牢騷的人。在「孔方兄」裏他咒詛着錢；在「十三娘」裏，他感歎着「聞道不平雙　裂，俠腸誰可借」；在「賈浪仙」裏，憤慨的指出文章無用，「止不過虛名喧鬨，救不得孤身寒凍」；而「呂洞賓」，更是憤恨的痛駡，從蔡奇一直到仙獒。</p>
<p>他借文章抨擊了當時社會的不平，政治的窳敗，希望能有大仙大俠出來。在封建社會裏生長的作家，其見解如此，是無可異的。但是，他的想望，似乎不止於此，就是他不僅希望這些「人間的不平」，爲仙仙俠俠所剷，也盼望着那些狗盜之徒也能被超度，能以放下屠刀。</p>
<p>這是道家的一貫思想，也是一貫的不現實的空想，當時作家中，也不止葉承宗一人是如此。</p>
<h3>一天</h3>
<p>— 千冬</p>
<p>早晨起來，握着筆正沙沙地預備寫一篇自己能够滿意的東西：可是，母親也沙地刮着米箱子裏的剩餘的米。</p>
<p>米又完啦！</p>
<p>我便放下筆，我不能再寫什麽了。</p>
<p>母親輕輕地在數着日子，初七，初八…他拿着這些殘餘的米到樓下去淘，一面自言自語地念着：「爲什麽吃得這樣快啦」！</p>
<p>洗着尿布的妻子，急急忙忙地跑上樓來，她惶恐地吶吶地對我耳語：「今天又要打米啦。下半天你跑出去吧」！</p>
<p>我點點頭。她又跑下去洗尿布了。</p>
<p>妹妹笑笑，整好書本上學校去了。</p>
<p>太陽已經觸到地上。我想再提起筆來，睡在搖籃裏的孩子却又那麼兇猛地咳嗽啦。他又哭得那麽可憐，正好像慘白的月夜下一隻孤猿在嗚咽，悠悠地而又哀傷地。他這樣的已經繼續四天啦。</p>
<p>我又擱下筆，拖過搖籃來，提着我枯萎的嗓子着他唱催眠歌。可是他還是那麽悠悠地哭得很悲傷，他的兩隻帶淚的小眼睛直釘住我，咿咿嗚嗚向我哭泣，而我又不懂他的話。</p>
<p>在這個時候，這聲音實在是太悲哀了，我簡直不能聽。我曾經想，假使一刀殺了他，他一定不會有絲毫抵抗的，也許當刀口觸着他頸項的時候，他還以爲在替他醫治咳破了的咽喉呢。也就是爲了他這把無抵抗的利刃，將我曾經刺殺過許多强悍的敵人的劍輕輕地縮回去了，反而，被這把無抵抗的利刃刺傷了我的心了！</p>
<p>從前，我總覺得，男人無論如何不應該哭的。現在我是朝着小孩的枯澀的臉哭啦，而且滂沱地流下淚來。</p>
<p>午飯早已煮熟，妹妹也放學了，可是我們却沒有平時的喜悅的聲音。</p>
<p>母親沈默地吃了一淺碗的飯，不吃了。</p>
<p>「怎麽？飯還有啦」。我說。</p>
<p>「不，我很飽。早晨起來的時候，肚子就有些飽，悶悶的」。她還咕咕咕地一打着呃。</p>
<p>妻子也只吃了一碗飯，不吃了，說是身體有點不舒服。妹妹也停下飯碗來。我不安地吃了一碗飯，也放下筷來了。</p>
<p>孩子又哭起來。妻子一面抱着孩子，一面用眼睛釘住我說：「那末，下半天你預備出去吧」？</p>
<p>「是，我就出去」！</p>
<p>我應着。我拭去衣服上的灰塵，揩一揩足上的破皮鞋，走了。</p>
<p>天陰沈下來，褐色的風狂吹着。馬路，是這裏一條那裏一條，像稠密的蜘蛛網。電車，汽車，來來往往在褐色的風裏飛着。我躊躇問着自己：</p>
<p>「往那裏去呢」？</p>
<h3>死去了的情緒</h3>
<p>— 魏中天</p>
<p>依舊是有着這樣淸朗的月亮的夜，依舊是有着這様灣曲的兩傍栽着楊柳的小道，假如是在三年前的話，當我孤獨的帶着寂寞的心走過時，我就會立着，或者徘徊着，舉頭望那閃閃的繁星，俯頭看着自己的影，作着各種各樣的荒唐的夢，到最後，人倦了，就會帶着乾笑離開了那小道的。可是，如今我依舊孤獨的走過這樣的小道，然而，這情境，再不能引起我作那些荒唐的夢，過去的那種感傷情緒全都死了。</p>
<p>所謂「靑春」，所謂「幸福」，騙去了我不少的熱情，不少的眼淚，使我在煩悶中打發了一大堆悠長的歲月。於今我覺悟了，從今後我不再荒唐不再蠢，不再在悲痛中失望中咬破自己的手指了。</p>
<p>靑年人應當有着朝氣，有着堅强的意志。幾年來艱難的生活吿訴我，一個人太弱是不行的，隨便受着半點刺激，隨便遇着小小的打擊就灰心，就消極，這不是一個年靑人應有的本份，這樣的靑年，終會被滾滾的潮流拋棄在兩岸的沙灘上的。一個人，在年靑的時候，有機會碰着各種的艱難各種惡劣的環境也不壤，因爲在這環境中，常常是把一個人磨練得更堅强更精幹的。我自己就是在惡劣的環境中拯救了出來，而且使我懂得了多量的人生智識。到今天，我更有這副勇氣來對付未來的艱難。</p>
<p>話雖這麽說，不遇我覺得我近來的日子仍是過得有點蠢，這也許是我的慾望太大和太熟情，所以使我在任何一個環境中都會感到不滿足，感到蠢！我的希望多得很，若是希望變成失望時當然苦，僥倖，萬一希望眞的達到目的了，跟着又會感到平凡與乏味的苦悶，這樣一來，常使我感到生活蠢得嚇人！這怨誰好？只好怨自己了。以前有一個時期總是希望着到日本來看深秋的紅葉，以爲在紅葉樹下坐着，讀着自己愛讀的書，高興時就採牠一片二片回來，夾在愛讀的書裏當書簽用，留到一年或十年後，有機會重翻開那愛讀的書時，發現那紅葉，追憶當時一切的情境，定是很愉快的吧。現在，紅葉是看過了，而紅葉給與我什麼呢？沒有的，要說有，就是那一堆惆悵而已。</p>
<p>天氣是一天天的和暖起來，在陽光裏似乎已有一點春天的氣息，不久以後，春天又要來臨了，等着吧，當春天來了的時候，櫻花也就跟着開放了。櫻花，「櫻花」這二個字也曾使我愛好過，現在尙不敢說什麽，當看了櫻花以後再來紀錄自己的心情了。</p>
<p>近來似乎感到有點兒寂寞，所以前天我就買了一個紫色的花瓶來，和一束紫色的花（我最歡喜紫色的），放在案頭上，想來調劑這生活，當我疲倦了就嗅嗅這花，滿心以爲在這花的氣息裏有着多量的溫情傳給我，然而，失望的，牠只給與我悶燥的戚覺，是的，這是應該的，因爲我通去那種情緒全都死去了。</p>
<h3>嚮晚（十六）</h3>
<p>— 屈軼</p>
<p>「哦！原來是那麼樣大的一隻臭虫」！</p>
<p>「臭虫嗎」？坐在洗澡間裏底新文學家，聽到隔壁在討論臭虫問題，突又心血來潮了。他想：「我在日本時候，臭虫是呌南京虫Nekin　Musi的。而在現在的國民經濟破產的時候咱們讀書人，却全變做奧虫階級了」。</p>
<p>可是坐起在坑床上的胡一元，却搖着手阻了紅頭文學家對這女臭虫的作弄。</p>
<p>「總之，雖然是隻臭虫，却是叮在你心裏的哪！心裏—」</p>
<p>「哈哈！」於是一陣陽氣的笑。可是笑聲中突然有一個奇怪的聲音夾和着：「少老板！少老板！」</p>
<p>直等笑聲停止了。又是你倒出來一下看。」一聲，—是帶有點恐怖的聲音。</p>
<p>胡一元立刻拖着拖鞋走出來，屋子裏找不出，那剛才頗熟習的聲音的播送者。坐在醉人旁邊撫着，摩着，笑着，抱着，各自淘醉在男女底謔笑裏的二個「女軍長」，却對胡一元往門外呶着嘴，示意。胡一元又走出門去。　僅僅一秒鐘工夫。胡一元形色愴惶地進來了。房間裏燈光也立時蒼白起來。</p>
<p>「去！去！你們趕快出去！貨來了！貨！」</p>
<p>一聽到貨，本來是屬於臭虫階級的她們，自然驚起了。嘴雖然笑着，心却沒有一時候放平來過，這是她晌晚時的生活。胡大少爺底多少帶有點吃驚的像風吹着壁縫的「去去」聲，自然在她們底神經底末梢；很快地起了個反應。她們立刻肅然歛容的悄悄地退出去了。接着胡一元又請走了。紅頭文學家，和尙在沉醉中的步行半個全國的李安。於是再一把拉起自家底娘舅。低低地貼在娘舅耳邊說：</p>
<p>「糟了！娘舅，給觸出　脚來了。那賣發財票！那水災獎！呀！趕快！咱們先走吧。先走了爲是！……」</p>
<p>二個人也踉踉蹌蹌走着出去了。</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>青年最劣年</h3>
<p>— 宸</p>
<p>一九三四年日曆擺在我們的案頭之時，許多政論者預言家都嚷着經濟恐慌大戰危機，到了「世界大破局」之日。</p>
<p>紐約基督敎靑年會秘書長棣愛克氏，在其一九三四年工作年報中，謂是年為美國歷史上靑年最惡劣之一年。「彼等之慘劇之兇惡性之全景，殆永遠不克判明，蓋精神的道德的性質之衰落，微妙無形，難作統計；然而人類之破爛使人震驚，則為事實。此項道德的衰微，係靑年時代在一個戰亂的世界中過度，繼之以世界重造，不健康的繁榮及不景氣之結果」。因彼等自覺「不見需於世」故也云。</p>
<p>一般唯心論者，總把人類「道德的衰微」解釋作精神惡劣或缺乏敎養所致，而忽略了經濟的物質原因。但是這素來自命為文明的盎格魯薩克遜靑年，我們總不會懷疑到他會精神惡劣缺少敎養吧，但是他們「在一個戰亂的世界中過度」，愛「健康的繁榮及不景氣之糟　」　使本見需於貴，因而「道德衰搬」了。猶之乎我們有了大學生失業，便產生出開學校斂錢的「高等流氓」，與大學生偷竊的事實。</p>
<p>不過我們要講的，靑年「道德衰微」是隨世界現社會末運以俱來，固如棣愛克氏所云，靑年「不負責任」，但是却非如紐約靑年會等社團所用的「性靈修養」能够「補救」。顯然，現時精神腐惡了的，中心尙不在一般靑年，而在造成「不健康繁榮及不景氣」的社會，和這部份人們的統治；正因為牠的存在，才使靑年處於「戰亂的世界中，」「不見需於世」，以致到了道德的衰微。抱着「性靈修養」的敎義，卽不能打破這一環境，也不使他見需於世，更不能輕便的就「繼之以世界重造」。</p>
<p>我們應當不要忘去：能够使世界重造的，常常總是那般「道德衰微」的奴隸。</p>
<h3>小五伯</h3>
<p>— 江天</p>
<p>五伯的年紀雖已過了半百了，但因他平時的那樣喜說喜笑的不成了老頭兒的樣子。所以小孩子們都不呌他五伯，却在五伯二字上加個小字，大家就都呌他小五伯。他聽小孩子們這樣呌他，他到事不生氣，反而獲歡喜似地和孩子們打玩。</p>
<p>小五伯到也算得是一個怪物，從小時候就喜歡玩，一直到了老了也還不變本性。據他自己說：從小就奔南北闖東西，很多省分的大城市小村鎭，到也鑽了一大半，認識的人也各色各樣都有，從來却沒和誰弄不好，個個都可稱兄道弟的。</p>
<p>有他的這樣本領，到也不錯。可是有一項，他却從娘孕裏生下來就窮，一　的到了半百歲以後還是窮　他在　淸時當過兵，在革命時參加過革命，當過茶房。做過長工，工人，農民，什麽的差役　幹過，也　去過南洋，所以他時</p>
<h2>Page 19</h2>
<p>時對人說：天下的什麽事悄，件件都做過，味兒到也嘗得不少了。到了四十歲，他才安心的在家鄉里種田。給兒子也討了一房媳婦。但過不了幾年，他那老婆子就死了，他到也沒什麼過不去，還是那麼合小孩子一樣的嬉皮笑臉，　　一點兒心事似地。到了他五十歲那一年，他媳婦雖已生過幾次小孩子，但却一個活着，好端端地一個才二十餘歲的兒子，就在這一年死了。這使他對一切都失望了，老頭兒就只好看着一個年靑的媳婦孤零零地活下去。他雖心里不快意，但他那喜說喜笑的老調兒却還不减當　。</p>
<p>小孩子們是個個喜歡他，我小的時候，也是一見了他，就要他講笑話，似乎他講得比別人好。</p>
<p>自己年紀漸漸大了，也就不大合小五伯接觸了，可是腦子里却忘不了他的影子。他兒子死時我才十七歲，從那年起，我就離開了故鄉沒回家去。到了前三年的一個陰曆正月，我又回到幾年不見的故鄉了。</p>
<p>走進故鄉的門，心里就想起了小五伯來，本來小五伯是時常到我家里來，他知道我回來，是一定會跑來看我的，可是等了一天，却不見他的影了到我家里來。第二天的早上，才爬下床，就問着我母親，我母親就訴說：</p>
<p>「他，已經死了，去年才死的，我倒忘記告訴你了」。</p>
<p>母親一壁說着一壁走下樓梯去。我這時聽了母親的幾句話，心里到愕住了，總在揣想着：一個活潑潑好似小孩子一樣的小五伯會這末快的死了？他那年靑的寡媳婦呢？心里在想，脚也不由自主的動起來，走出了門，就望着他家裏跑去。</p>
<p>轉灣抹角的走過了幾條幽靜的小路，就到了小五伯家的門口了。我看看那門板，石階，銅門環，門板上的兩個褪色的一福字，一切都如舊時的門庭。只有那二張白紙黑字的對子是新近貼在門板上的。我輕輕地敲了幾下門環，兩扇木板門呀的一聲就開了。</p>
<p>「呵！是芝叔嗎？請到里面坐坐吧！」</p>
<p>一個中年的婦人閃現在我的眼前，她說了一聲就讓我先走進去。我一邊走一邊說：</p>
<p>「大嫂還住在這里，一向好吧？為什麼不到我們家里玩玩，過新年也得歡喜歡喜呀！」</p>
<p>她在我後面走着，却一聲不饗，我在她那供奉着五伯的靈位的廳上坐談了一會也就走了。</p>
<p>「一個人生着也沒什麽滋味，像小五伯的樣的人，一生到老沒好日子過，自己死了却留着一個寡媳婦。她，今年也不過二十四五歲，正是靑春的時期，難道已挨過了幾年，現在還想挨下去嗎？在現在這個世界上，守節也不容易了，做妮姑去吧，在這年頭做妮姑也不見得就會淸白到澈底，像她這樣還想怎樣呢？」</p>
<p>一壁想一壁走，已到了自家的門口了。</p>
<h3>光榮的日子</h3>
<p>— 華之</p>
<p>根保從牢獄中釋放出來已是第二年的春天了。</p>
<p>除了從前爸新蓋三間茅屋的那年冬天，他曾懷了花緣的紙幣度過一個笑臉的新年之外，之後就祗有在唉聲嘆氣之中打發那一連串難過的年關。雖然在記憶之中，喝酒，賭博，唱社戲，以及和招姐偷偷地在山背後私會，覺得被剝奪這種綺麗之夢是够難受的。但是每天從扳床上直起身來就得想法子合家的兩餐秈子粥，餓肚子的難挨，卽使想起新蓋茅屋那年的盛况，也打不起一個免强的笑臉。打發一個日子就是勾延一天生命，他正害怕着新年的到來，在他身上作更多一層的綠削；綺麗之夢是被打得粉碎而不能在腦角間尋覓一絲一毫的痕跡了。</p>
<p>所以當他被如狼如虎的鐵鍊鎖進縣城去的時候：他對吊着莫奈何的淸淚，站在村口送行的鄰居，作長嘯的笑聲說：「好罷！到縣城去坐吃過年罷！」這悲壯的故事至今村中被認為英雄式的。其實那里知道在眼淚掩遮背面底他的心境呢！</p>
<p>有着光榮歷史的老父，自從妻子故世之後，陰暗之綱就常年籠罩在那個被工作磨折了底多紋的臉上。在苦愁的生活中，還奮着他僅餘的精力帮同兒子犂鋤幾畝薄田，而賜給他的是三間新蓋茅屋都變了姓。從此獲得了一個等侯死日來臨的不治之症。</p>
<p>帶着重重的苦難，根保踏進了黑暗的獄房。沒有太陽，沒有同情。混過了那些糢糊的日子而釋放出來的時候，他爸的新墳上已滋長了靑色的小草了。於是他再扶起父親遺留下來的鐵鋤，踏着父親遺留着的血跡，孤獨地播種這幾畝曾有過光榮日子的田地。</p>
<p>他冥想着從自己的手臂上再建立起父親光榮的歷史，那三間茅屋新蓋的時候，家中殺羊屠豬，鄰村的長少老幼都來慶賀，廣塲上就排起了列隊的衫木桌子，大碗的肉，大碗的酒，這熱鬧的情形往往母親們以後作為勉勵兒子們的故事。提起根保伯村裏是誰不曉得？根保想起了這光榮的歷史，綺麗之夢不由得又浮現出來。</p>
<p>—乳燕穿梭着柳條，莊稼漢子在田里唱着私情的山歌。根保吃過了媽送來的午飯，在爸抽着旱姻躺在樹根下休息的時候，一溜姻的奔到山後去和招姐打混，那種日子呵，被苦難的日子磨平了</p>
<p>根保望着鄰近的田里，沒有一個唱山歌的漢子，長長的芳草在春風中發野。「這勢口莊稼人是祇有餓死！」狗富揹上了包裹不知到那裏去了，他留下的這句警告把村中的壯年漢子都丟下了莊稼跑碼頭去了。根保把鐵鋤拋在身畔，担着自家的命運恐怕已經接近了滋長滿了靑草的墳墓吧！</p>
<p>上一代把希望付託在下一代的身上，而下一代的希望呢？布穀鳥在樹頭飛過，是播種的時候了呵！春天不是讀書天昨日不值錢的「寶貝」誤「寶欠」</p>
<h3>春天不是讀書天</h3>
<p>昨日不值錢的寶貝誤寶欠</p>
<h3>小白鴿</h3>
<p>— 羅姗</p>
<p>工作的人總覺得太煩忙，游蕩的人們感得太一無事事，於是想方法去塡滿閒暇的時間，兩週前朋友送來了一對小鴿子，羽毛白色的，尾巴有梅花點綴着，眼睛異常秀麗，於是，那對小白鴿便成為我的友伴了。</p>
<p>彷彿有神推動似地，一淸早，大約六點鐘的時光，我慌張地爬起牀，打開窗子，緩緩地由鐵絲網空中偷瞧她們的睡容，可是無論我起得多早，或是輕得聯自己都不信的步音，而她們老早在那裏跳動着了，於是揭開籠門，撲的一聲飛走了。</p>
<p>籠子是按置於我的三層樓上的左邊牆壁間的，我那不算低的房子眞正對着西子湖，和北高峯恰恰成個直綫，八字塔和孤山靠在右邊，風景是很美麗的，兼以有一對小白鴿的點綴，更顯得生動。</p>
<p>關切一對小白鴿的起居飲食，我彷彿有種說不出的慰籍，而那種慰籍是超物質超人世的。</p>
<p>（為什麼我竟會變成這樣子？）一向煩厭小生物的我，對於忽然的反常驚奇　，時常問自己。</p>
<p>飛翔了整天倦怠地撲着輕翅回來時，我幽嫺地在窗口等待着，於是把她們捉在我的手裏，好像慰勞她們一天的辛勤，用手指撫摸着羽毛，光澤地發有的羽毛，固然討喜歡，然她們的溫駛乎我意料的，軟綿綿地裝睡的姿熊，頓然像天然的母性顯露着，把她們的眼放上自己的臉龐，好像那是我唯一的繫念痛愛的事物了。</p>
<p>（哈！你那樣喜歡歡她們，如果換了孩子不更好麼？）</p>
<p>當有一天，我正在為她們個別地洗操時，朋友看不過我那奇特的愛護，小心，他那樣說。</p>
<p>（噯，要是孩子的話，那……）</p>
<p>我吞下去了，不明白為什麼，我不顧意提起那些，雖然我已開始幻想，要是孩子的話，在目前自我不厭惡小生物的日子起，我將用我全生命去愛護她們，灌漑她們以智識，造成理想中的偉人。</p>
<p>繼續我每天的工作，抖掉鴿籠裏的鳥糞，用一塊新棉花墊下去，心想，幾天來陰霾佈滿於天空，說不定會下雪的，如果下雪，那這對小白鴿準得凍壞吧。</p>
<p>我望望蹬在鴿籠中的她們，眉心緊擠成三條紋印，胸口彷彿有千斤沈的鐵塊壓住了。</p>
<h3>紙鳶</h3>
<p>— 勞心</p>
<p>春天來了，心裏浮上了一層快樂。該怎樣地來歡迎這春天哩？雖然這個春天並不是為我們而來的。</p>
<p>這，在我過去的很多陳舊的痕跡裏，也可以找出怎樣歡迎的例子，但是在這些例子之中，也是永遠地尋找不到一種作為好的有意思的方法，因為我的過去是這樣地平凡。如果一定要找一種出來的話，那只好靦顏地說出來：紙鳶。</p>
<p>眞的，紙鳶曾經在一個時候是我的好朋友。我記得，那時還是五六歲的孩子，在鄉下裏是一個十足頑皮的牧牛童，雖然生活是過得並不怎樣好，可是孩子時的心理，只要自由，只要有朋友玩要，便顧不得別些的了。在春天，這樣的一個好季節裏，我們幾位頑皮的小同志是頂高興玩放紙鳶。不過，我們的鄉下很村僻，紙鳶買得來並不易，而且很貴。因此曾經有一次為了買一隻紙鳶買不成功，賭氣一天沒有吃飯。</p>
<p>放紙鳶一定要別人帮助，請一位朋友拿了紙鳶站在高的地方舉起，而後自己拿緊了綫紮，用力地一抽一抽的，如果是風大的話，很迅速地便會高高地飛起了。有時風比較寗靜一點的話，便站在牛板背上放；有時還扒到屋頂上來。當紙鳶象一隻餓鷹般在半空裏躀觔斗時，可算是絕妙的，不過要這樣便得有本頒：沒本領的只配放得高高跌了下來。</p>
<p>中國人好打鬥，無論什麽東西也想得出打鬥的方法來，紙鳶自然不能例外。因此，比方偶然間發現了別的不同自己的紙鳶時，便象開戰時發現了敵機一樣，很迅速地調動了自己的轄下的紙鳶，向敵方圍攻，直至用自己的綫割斷了敵機的綫為止；有時也會給別人割斷了自己紙鳶的綫的，這就要看你的經騐和膽量去應戰了。往常我是很高興玩這個的，因為這也得思巧和技術，而且此較有趣味一點的玩藝。</p>
<p>過去的一剎過去了，現在浮浪到了這大都市裏來，這些過去只能成為歷史的陳跡。我們要眞的看放紙鳶，只好在報章雜誌的小品文裏找了，或者看大人先生們提倡來救國的紙鳶運動吧了。早幾年看見一篇詩，他描寫春天的季節：「紙鳶掛在電綫上」。這無疑地是一個很好的描寫，可是如果作者是居住在上海的，那又未免有點滑稽了。我從未在上海看過一隻紙鳶飛在天空上。</p>
<p>偶然有一天在馬路上碰到了一個五六歲的孩子在放紙鳶了。我心裏便有點高興起來：我的理想不一定是對的，大都市也有孩子放紙鳶的呀。但是，當我看了那孩子放紙鳶的可憐相，心裏又不免失望起來，因為他是那樣地愚蠢呀。他在一條舖滿了煤姻灰的馬路上，一隻半破的紙鳶，在他引着的小綫上飛呀飛的，也許不能飛得過一個大人的頭上。這樣飛沒有用的呀，差不多我想去帮他的忙，使他的紙鳶飛高一點。可是　疑地這也是理想，任你天大本領的人也不可以使一隻破鳶在這樣的平地上人叢中飛到天上去的。…</p>
<p>呀—我驚惶起來了。小孩子，那放紙鳶的小孩子給一輛車子碰倒了。倒在地上哭。</p>
<p>春不會到我們的領域來的，也許。</p>
<h3>春雨</h3>
<p>— 陳亮</p>
<p>揭開了那幅墨綠色的窗緯並沒有像平日那樣一個照耀着輕鬆而和煦的陽光的早晨，却是，沉鬱的，呌每一個人見了都戚覺着不舒快的陰天。</p>
<p>「要下雨吧，天總不肯給人多爽快幾天！」</p>
<p>披着沒有整理過的頭髮，兩條胳膊緊裏着紫紅色的睡衣，那樣一躺，便躺倒在沙發上，她有着一張和陰天一樣沉鬱的臉，不想笑可亦不想哭，昨天的生活她是過過來了，她又想着今天……今天呵？</p>
<p>可是，那張半牀上有個側睡着，面孔向外，嘴唇上貼着半支「白金龍」的靑年在喊着她的名字—連續的；「彩娥…彩娥……」</p>
<p>眞的下起雨來了，敲着玻璃窗，連綿的—春雨哪。</p>
<p>她沒給回話，光是用右手搥着她自己的腦袋，誰呌這名字呢？為着生活，連自己的年歲和姓名都得瞞着人的，幹嗎？我就一生一世欺騙着人苟延在人間，為什麽我不能說出我眞實的姓命和歲數？她氣得眞想悲悲切切的哭一塲，可是，萬萬不行，眼淚該往肚子裏咽，她處於這地位，只有笑的本份，沒有哭的權利，她翻過身，她跌入無底愁帳之淵。</p>
<p>「頭痛嗎？」那躺在牀上的靑年含着一絲奇異的目光。</p>
<p>「謝謝吧，這種假情假義，這種虛偽的，言不發乎衷的慰問，你不是為着愛來的，你是市慾來的，別說頭痛，就是我今天兀的死了，還不是你走你的—」想着。她過意的不給理睬，她是比誰都明瞭　自己的遭際和地位的，可是，她不能直截了當的指破一個會在相當條件下給予自己一些生命源泉的男子的虛僑。</p>
<p>窗外的雨是越下越大了，一嘩嘩嘩嘩」地，像永無休止的樣子，幾根並行列的電綫，亦無休止地向窗裏面的人淌着眼淚，每顆雨珠打着玻璃窗格，也打</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>着她柔嫩的心朶，激起星星故創的隱痛，慢散而捉摸不定的－神經的隱痛。</p>
<p>那青年下床走了過來，用他兩隻粗蠻的手坳過她的腦袋，一座陳列在美術院裏的半身石膏造像似的，不想笑亦不想哭。</p>
<p>「吞幾片阿司必靈吧。」</p>
<p>「爲什麽？」</p>
<p>「你不是有頭痛病嗎！」</p>
<p>可是她笑了「病！你是懂得我的病得嗎？阿司必靈就會醫得了我的病嗎」這麼大聲大氣的從她紫紅的嘴唇皮裏噴射出來。她伸手撩開披掛在眼前的亂髮，一骨咯跑到窗前，雨絲風片祗隔著一塊脆薄的玻璃向她襲擊，她從迷濛的霧氣裏瞧著下面的市街，依舊是衝來衝去，沒一刻不顯着忙碌的行人和街車。</p>

<h3>電影發達的簡史（十一）</h3>
<p>— 文瀛</p>
<p>（十一）默片時代技巧的完成</p>
<p>金維多所導演的（The　Big　Parade）其中有男女主角嚼口香糖的一幕，那種幽默的風味，是凡看見的人，都不會忘記的。但是怎樣攝成的呢，說來殊堪令人發噱。按照原有的脚本，並沒有嚼口香糖的一幕的。祇要男女主角很簡單的相會就是了。那時的男主角是約翰吉爾勃（John　Gilbert）女主角是法籍明星倫妮亞道利（Renee　Adoree），她的早死亦是電影界很大的損失）。</p>
<p>倫妮正在攝影塲上，等待開始拍戲的時候，她很舒閒地咀嚼着口香糖。她偶然的說了一句話，說法國的鄉下人，在歐戰以前，還沒有看見過這東西。等到歐戰末葉，美國少年兵開到法國去之後，這東西亦就隨着風行於法國了。這幾句話給金維多聽見了，他就喊起來道：「好極了。約翰，你拿一條口香搪給倫尼吃。敎給她怎樣吃法。她不懂你的語言。你亦不懂他的話。你們用手勢來表演。」</p>
<p>他們亦沒有試演過。倫尼和約翰旣沒有準備，亦不知道吃完了口香辨之後怎樣。開未拉徐徐地搖着搖着。攝影師看着導演的臉，靜等他喊「卡脫」。可見導演　看着男主角吃口香搪，亦不喊「卡脫」，這使攝影師疑惑起來，這吃些口香精，亦要費這許多膠片，不知道金維多別具隻眼，所見與人不同也。等到那一幕拍完，已經成了一切影片中，空前最長的單獨的一幕。這亦可以說是攝影藝術上，和導演手法上的一大改革。</p>
<p>當影片剪接完畢，那吃口香糖的一幕景，竟能保持了原璧。到了公映之後，觀衆們看了影片的全豹之後，最受感觸的，亦就是那一幕。這小小的「程序製作」的攝製費，一共不到二十萬美金，但是公映之後，在紐約一地所售得的蔡資却巳超過了八十萬美金。這張戰事影片的成功，亦就可想而知，而觀衆們在厭倦戰事之後，而能對於這（The　Big　Parade）獨表歡迎，亦可見心理的反覆無常，以及一位好導演操縱人心的手腕了。</p>
<p>過去的光榮，我們可以無須再去感歎。但是好萊塢的進展，是極速的。好萊塢是個生動，活潑靑嫩，可愛的東西，但是它一切的生機，都是由於靑春富足的血液發生出來的金錢，金錢，金錢，就是好萊塢的血液，生命之源。在以前所說的默片時代中，投資最大的幾張影片，要推賓漢」（Ben　Hur）為第一。除去金錢之外，一般有關係的人，所灌注於其中的心血，亦是可觀的。但是那張片子，終究是歷史上不可磨滅的傑構。其餘的幾張，如Beau　Geste”，The　Covered　Wagon”，“Phantom　of　The　Opera”，“Robin　Hood”　等，直到現在，一定　瀠洄於你們的腦中哩。</p>
<p>電影的前進，是極迅速的，但是它所經過的路程，却並不是康莊坦道，多少次它幾幾乎被毀滅，但是却能轉危為安因禍得福。現在大家鬧着「淸潔運動」使影界感到極度的不安，但是第一次的註册戰爭（Patent　War），却幾幾乎送了它的命。同時受了「檢查」的打擊，幾致一蹶不振。那時的電影界人物，不無行動失檢的地方，但是他們能懸崖勒馬，及早回頭。他們答應了以後守規矩，並且推舉了一位威爾海斯（Will　Hayes）作為好萊塢的道德檢閱使，這才安然渡過難關，而達現在的地位。</p>
<p>你於回顧之餘。且不要笑那些默片的簡陋無聊，因為其中最好的製作，在技巧上却巳達到了完善的程度。三十年以來，從「活動西洋景」發展到技巧完善的電影事業，却是一件驚人的進展。金錢亦富足了，它可以聘用大導演，第一流的作家，和名伶。它已到了無不可為的地步了。它在藝術上，已經登峯造極了。但是，一個人到了最高峯之後，再往那裏去？如同三十年以前，觀衆看了簡單活動的影片而感到厭倦，必須加以人物故事的編輯一樣，他們現在又感覺到同樣的厭倦。影片公司漸漸蝕本了。影戲院裏觀衆漸漸稀少了。難道電影技巧完成之後，却又到了末路嗎？（待續）</p>

<p>影片談評</p>
<h3>評「復活」</h3>
<p>— 凌鶴　尤兢</p>
<p>We　Life　Again—南京映</p>
<p>一，托爾斯泰</p>
<p>關於托爾斯泰（Leo　To　lstoy　1828—1910）這位俄羅斯的，也是全世界的大藝術家，不是我們在這兒用簡短的篇幅，所能寫傳够的。為了對於「復活」這一文藝鉅著，托氏藝術觀，宗敎觀—表示所謂「托爾斯泰主義的思想最鮮明的作品之深一層的瞭解起見，我們簡略地從托氏的生平中來看一下他的藝術論與宗敎覜。</p>
<p>里奧·托爾斯泰，和他同時代的另一你大的作家伊凡·屠格湼夫（Ivan　Turgenev）同樣是出身貴族，由於現實生活的接觸，而對於自己出身的階級，深致不滿的。托氏從加桑大學出來之後，寄寓在高加索當聯隊士官的兄長家中，不久也擔任了士官的職務，在與許多軍人的接觸中，他濃厚地沾染了當時少年軍官們的習氣，而不自覺地墮入酗酒，賭博，玩樂的生活，這可以說是墮落的一段生活，給他後來在絕對不同的生活態度中，以深沉的懺悔資料。一八五五年參加了克里米亞戰爭，目擊了戰塲中的一切慘狀，由這認識當時戰爭的本質，於是成為他晚年非軍國主義，與澈底的主張和平主義的基礎，戰爭之後，他漫游了英法德各國，加上回國後的對當時所謂文明的底頁之昏暗醜惡，有了深恐痛絕的認識，就在結婚的幾年之後，冷淡了他巳有成果的著作事業，以一個宗敎與社會改革活動的熱心與實行者，向當時的文明投一個極大的炸彈。可是由於他所出發的竹學的二元，與原始基督敎敎養的歸向與發揮，他這一炸彈是不像他所想的那般有力。</p>
<p>你貧困，正是富足</p>
<p>你强頑，就是弱者，</p>
<p>母親的，俄羅斯呵！</p>
<p>托爾斯泰這樣唱着。托氏一方面不但是以俄羅斯民衆生活眞好的繪圖，給世界文壇第一流作品的天才藝術家，同時他是狂信基督敎的地主。一方面對於社會的虛偽與欺瞞，作無情的，强烈的，直接與眞摯的反抗者，然而又以托爾斯泰宗敎徒來對羣衆說他自己雖是醜惡，可是是在從事道德的自我完成的智識份子，衰損與精神病的虛弱者。他無悄地批判當時體制的榨取，沙皇政府的專制更深實地解剖社會的矛盾，但同時又狂信着對於暴力的「惡害的無抵抗」的傳道。他見解與敎義上的矛盾不是偶然的，是十九世紀三十年間俄羅斯生活中的矛盾條件的表現，所以對托氏的見解，單只用近代勞動運動以及科學的社會主義的觀點來觀察與評價是不够的，應該在當時正在到來的資本主義及大衆的貧窮化與土地的喪失，而必然的從專制的農村生出之反抗的這種見地去評價。托氏是俄羅斯資產階級革命到來時，幾百萬農民底思想及精神的偉大表現者。</p>
<p>二，「復活」</p>
<p>「復活」這一小說，在托爾斯泰的著作中，比之「戰爭與和平」，「婀娜小史」以及其他短篇在藝術上是較差的。但，牠是托氏晚年的傑作，是他藝術觀，宗敎觀最具體與明顯地表現的結晶，是成為作者小說中最世界性的一部。</p>
<p>在「復活」中托氏羅織了他所接觸到的問題，當時社會的結癥，黑暗的焦點，特別是「土地與自由」的問題的注意，在一個戀愛故事的外衣下，通過他的宗敎觀，而給以解决。特別是在後半，他以自己的替身迭密區里扮演了從墮落的罪惡中，懺悔出來，皈依到宗敎的無政府主義，個人的地去解决他所見到的大衆的問題，這本來是非常滑稽的事。可是在托氏這誠摯的熱情的，藝術的，悲劇中，巧妙地獲得了他所企圖的效果。這在一些無條件的崇拜托爾斯泰的一切中，我們得强調地指出的。</p>
<p>三，銀幕上的「復活」</p>
<p>記得以前我們曾經看過「娜娜」，那是高爾溫（Samvel　Goldwyn）監製的，也由安娜斯丹主演。同時我們也不會忘記，左拉（Emil　Zola）的「娜娜」在高爾溫的製作之下是變質了的，這是說小說土的娜娜並沒有原般的在銀幕上出現，而高爾溫的娜娜却是完全通過了商人的有色眼睛而出現的。因而「娜娜」在價值上的損失，頗招致了觀眾的不滿。現在，托爾斯泰的「復活」又在高爾溫的如意算盤之下搬上銀幕了，和「娜娜」一樣，這使原着的小說，改換了本來面目。</p>
<p>為了說明這一點，我們很可以舉出如下的證明。</p>
<p>「復活」所以成為托爾斯泰的代表作，所以成為世界性的偉大名著，正因為在最後的部份有着托爾斯泰主義的展開，因此男主人公在最後犧牲自己成全了茄陀莎（Katiiaha　Malova）西蒙孫（Simdnson）的戀愛，迭密區里王子隻身從事社會事業去了。所謂被認為原始的基督敎義的機械的翻讀「馬太福昔」跪在聖像面前，企圖在聖經中得着社會問題的解决。</p>
<p>就在這種地方，正是托爾斯泰主義最中心的發揮，正是評價「復活」的基調，同時為了愛而犧牲自己的愛，也是作為托爾斯泰的戀愛觀表現出來。然而在高爾溫的製作之下，却完全忽略了這一重心，而是Happy　Endirlg的使男女主人公結合了，歪曲了原著的茄陀莎和政治犯西蒙的結婚，歪曲了迭密區里尋求社會問題解决的精神。固然我們對於托爾斯泰主義，在現階段不能有過高的評價，那末進步的電影作家是可以大膽修正這種錯誤的，但是劇作者全部是接收了原著的宗敎藝術的主張，祗是在後面摘去了原著的精華，於是將原名的Resurrection改為（We　Life　Again），其實是庸俗的（We　Love　Aga　n）罷了。</p>
<p>在這裏充分說明了劇作者是在高爾溫的授意之下，沒有很好的理解原著，進而在其他塲合也表演着技術上的缺憾。最主要的我們得提出茄陀莎在火車站去找迭密區里的時候，在默片的『復活」中（桃樂絲德里奧主演）那是最動情感的一塲，那是使觀衆痛哭流淚的。可是在一影片裏却是這般平凡不僅是和在花棚中一樣的沒來由的下雨，而主要的是在造成悲劇的高潮效果上的失敗。同時在花棚失身之前，迭密區里是說在美麗的夏夜裏偕她散步的，雨來得未免過於奇突。再要提出的，便是因為以『七年以後」的字幕說明時間的過去，將女主人公淪為娼妓和失誤殺人的過程，不是畫而的表現而是對話的說明，於是劇巾人茄陀莎個性的變換，沒有給觀衆明快的體念，然而這也是默片的成功之處。</p>
<p>但是這一影片却將宗敎的塲合儘量的誇張，作為積極的接收原著宗敎藝術的說敎。同時這些地方，由於馬穆林（Rouben　Mamouliau）導演手法的純熟，更由於弗萊立馬區和安娜斯丹演技的優秀，却是在技巧上頗為成功的。</p>
<p>特別應常提及的是馬穆林，在一懋歌』和『瓊宮恨更」之後，在這裏所表現的他的導演技巧，就劇本所規定的範圍，無論如何是作為優秀的技術家而成功了的。自然我們不能不指出火車站等塲面表現了織接法的錯誤，因而失去了悲劇的情感，然而對於演技的指導，或者對於單獨的塲面之處理，都見純熟。尤其是對於囚徒生活殘酷的描寫，其刺戟觀衆的力量，極得電影藝術上的成功。不失為偉大的文藝作品。</p>
<p>四，結論</p>
<p>「復活」被多次的搬上銀幕，正說明了電影商人是怎樣利用着世界名著。然而當他們在曲解原著的時候，却是充分的表明商人態度之庸俗。在這裏沒有做到悲劇的最高效果，雖然在個別的技巧方面給與了我們很大的滿足。不過軟性紳士常將藝術價值和政治價值對立起來，那末假使他們不否認托爾斯泰是藝術家的話，對於『復活」中的說敎，不知有何解釋？</p>
<p>「復活」兩主角安娜史丹與茀德立馬區在俄大文豪託爾斯泰氏不朽傑著巾演出</p>
<h3>反帝影片「美人心」</h3>
<p>攝製了一年多的「美人心」，終於在日前告竣了。</p>
<p>「美人心」是徐欣夫繼「鹽潮」後的一部力作。它的故事描寫一個名士的女兒，愛上了一個東北義勇軍。戎馬倥　。情絲挽不住雄心，終於義勇軍戰死在疆場上。在悲恨的情緒中，其它許多的民族英雄依舊很嚴肅地進行着。</p>
<p>在這「高女不知亡國恨隔江猶唱後庭花」的時候，這部反帝的影片，無疑的是有很嚴重的意義的。它是民氣消沉中和醉生夢死者的興奮劑，使觀衆看了欲哭無淚，欲笑無聲。</p>
<p>在導演的技巧方面，較「鹽潮」更為美滿。當然，意義也較「鹽潮」史為嚴重。再加上許多富麗堂皇的佈景，和細膩深刻的表情，它將出於人們意外地成功</p>
<p>由胡蝶，王徵信，顧梅君蘭君，徐莘　等演出。（却）</p>

<h3>National Cooperative Undertaking</h3>
<p>Nanjing. The Central Agricultural Experiment Station of the Ministry of Industry has recently published the results of a survey on the national cooperative undertaking as follows: There are 14,649 cooperative societies in the country, with Jiangsu ranking first with 2,937 societies, followed by Shandong with 2,472 societies, Hebei with 1,435 societies, Zhejiang with 1,793 societies, Anhui with 1,463 societies, Jiangxi with 1,078 societies, Henan with 997 societies, Hubei with 566 societies, and Hunan with 558 societies.

In terms of the nature of cooperative societies, credit cooperative societies account for more than 76% of the total, cooperative societies that both produce and market account for 8.9%, and cooperative societies that purchase and utilize account for less than 4%. In addition, the number of cooperative societies increased by as much as 1.8 times in the past year. The rate of increase was the greatest in Shaanxi, Hunan, Shanxi, Hubei, Henan, Anhui, Shandong and other provinces.

However, according to our country's population of 400 million, there are currently only 1.4 members per 1,000 people. Compared with the Soviet Union, which has 656 people per 1,000, and other 17 countries with more than 100 people per 1,000, 21 countries with more than 10 people per 1,000, and 13 countries with 2 to 10 people per 1,000, our country ranks only 53rd, still lagging behind.

<h3>The Wrong Path of American Policy Towards China</h3>
<p>— Hoshino</p>
<p>Since the economic and financial panic in our country began, our diplomacy towards Japan has taken a sharp turn. All the powers with interests in the Far East are in a state of panic, devising countermeasures. Among these countries, the one most troubled and hesitant, in our estimation, is probably the United States. According to a Washington dispatch, U.S. Under Secretary of State Philipps has consulted with the British Ambassador to the United States, Lindsay, on the China issue. They plan to reorganize the international banking consortium based on the Nine-Power Treaty to help China overcome its current economic and financial difficulties and avoid the desperation of choosing anything to eat in times of famine. We are now in a dilemma, facing both a fierce tiger in front and a deep abyss behind. We need not harbor extravagant hopes, nor need we favor one over the other. However, at this point, we cannot help but regret the lack of a definite Far East policy in the United States, focusing only on the present and not considering the long term.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that America's policy towards China in the Far East is one of open door and territorial integrity. However, this is not a policy, but merely a slogan. To implement a country's policy, it should be revised according to local conditions and the times. However, the fundamental spirit must be pursued with all efforts. Japan's pursuit of its continental policy and Britain's pursuit of its Suez policy are both examples of this. However, the U.S. government, clinging to its traditional isolationism and the Monroe Doctrine, and relying on its geographical and national strength, often starts strong but ends weakly when it comes to foreign policy, or promises benefits but does not deliver. Its promotion of the League of Nations, its advocacy of the London Economic Conference, its proposal to not recognize puppet states, and its interpretation of the "over-negotiation" point in the Treaty of Paris all contradict theory and practice, and its claims are divorced from action. This makes countries around the world often doubt whether the United States can "see things through from beginning to end."</p>
<p>China's survival in East Asia depends solely on self-reliance and striving. However, for China's allies, if they have no territorial or political ambitions, they should recognize that a strong and prosperous China is the best guarantee of the interests of the powers. In other words, how to enable China to achieve genuine unity and positive construction as soon as possible, and improve the living standards and purchasing power of the Chinese people, so as to achieve the goal of benefiting others and oneself. However, countries often lack foresight. Although there are provisions in the Nine-Power Treaty guaranteeing China's opportunity for self-development, they are willing to sacrifice future gains for immediate interests, just like the saying goes, "killing the goose that lays the golden eggs." Japan's occupation of our four northeastern provinces goes without saying. Even Soviet Russia is now eyeing Xinjiang. France is reluctant to concede in the Sino-French Vietnam Treaty. All are doing the same. What disappoints us the most is that the United States, which China has always regarded as a good friend, is also stubbornly pursuing its silver policy, making China's economic difficulties increasingly acute. Its lack of enthusiasm for maintaining the "open door" policy and its lack of effort in cooperating with the powers make us doubt whether the American diplomatic authorities have a consistent position and basic attitude.</p>
<p>Now, the Far East issue is not far from a comprehensive resolution. The American people should have the determination to either move forward or retreat, and there is no possibility of wandering down a wrong path. The policy of isolationism is difficult to sustain in today's economically interdependent world. Those who are clear about the world situation all know this. Cooperation among the powers in the Far East is relatively feasible and more in line with the direction of peace. However, cooperation among the powers often follows the lead of the United States. This is because the United States is the initiator of the Nine-Power Treaty, its national strength is stronger than that of Britain, France, and Russia, and its future hopes in the Far East are greater than those of European countries. If the American authorities can truly recognize the mistakes of wandering down a wrong path and the shortsightedness of seeking temporary security, then they should determine their direction and clarify their attitude as soon as possible. For the Far East issue, the first step is to change their silver policy to avoid China's economic and financial difficulties. The second step is to actively lead the major powers under the principles of the Nine-Power Treaty to provide a practical solution to the Far East issue. This is not only what world peace depends on, but also where American interests lie. May the wise American government authorities consider this carefully.</p>

<h3>Japanese Commercial Attaché Yokotake Discusses Sino-Japanese Cooperation; Improving Agricultural Technology Stationed in China</h3>

Mr. Yokotake stated at the meeting, "Although the Chinese government has explicitly stated that it prohibits anti-Japanese movements, we must temporarily observe the situation. China is an agricultural country, but due to natural disasters and other reasons, it imports 200 million yuan worth of rice, wheat, cotton, sugar, etc. every year. If Japan assists in improving its agricultural technology and agricultural products, making China a powerful raw material producing country, and cooperates with Japan's industrial technology, then the substance of Sino-Japanese cooperation can be realized."

<h3>New King of Siam Ascends the Throne at a Young Age; State Affairs Handled by the Regency Council; Similar to the King of Yugoslavia; Attempted Assassination of the Minister of Defense Fails</h3>
<p>Bangkok Prince Ananda Mahidol, nephew of the former King of Siam, who is eleven years old, ascended the throne as King of Siam today. Before he comes of age, all state affairs will be handled by the Regency Council. The King of Siam's parents are currently residing in Lausanne, Switzerland, and will come here soon. The former King of Siam is now residing in England and has changed his name to Prince Sukhothai. (Reuters dispatch on the 7th)</p>
<p>Bangkok Today, the proclamation was made that the eleven-year-old prince, nephew of the king, is the new monarch of Siam. This is the second young ruler in recent months to ascend the throne at the same age. The new king, Prince Ananda, is the nephew of the King of Siam, who abdicated last week and retired with his Queen to Surrey, England. The Siamese government has organized a Regency Council to assist the young ruler until he comes of age. The chairman of the Regency Council is Prince Anuwatna. The new King of Siam, Ananda Mahidol, and King Peter II of Yugoslavia both ascended the throne at a young age. Although both countries are ruled by a regency, the people of both countries await the coronation of the new king and the future of the royal family. The experience of Peter II was far more tragic than that of the new King of Siam, because his father, King Alexander, was assassinated while visiting Versailles. The accession of the new King Ananda this time was due to the King of Siam's voluntary abdication because the cabinet rejected his proposed reforms. However, the official statement released today stated that the King abdicated on March 2. This morning, there was an attempt to assassinate Minister of Defense Siri Ratnuthu, which was thwarted. The edict of the new king's succession to the throne has stabilized the tense atmosphere in the country. Prior to this, the government kept the new king's movements a secret and strictly censored the news to prevent leaks. Some quarters have stated that the people have repeatedly requested the former king to continue on the throne, so the news of the former king's abdication may cause some political turmoil. The army is now in control of all government agencies and will effectively rule the country until the new king is formally proclaimed. It is said that for the sake of protecting the new king, all activities will be prevented to demonstrate to the former king. The King of Siam ascended the throne in 1925 and had absolute power, but the King did not like the vast power. The King wanted to educate his people and instill knowledge in them, at least to enable the people to participate in politics. The King proposed promulgating a constitution. Powerful princes opposed this proposal because their power would be shaken, but the Nationalist Party cooperated with the King and eventually won. Although Siam implemented an autonomous system, the King continued to educate the people tirelessly. Many people thought he was too radical, but the world believed that Siam was in the most stable position in this turbulent world. It is said that the king's return to the throne is still possible, as the young King Michael of Romania recently abdicated to his father, King Carol. The new king is the king's beloved nephew, and some quarters have stated that the king only needs to lift a finger to remove all obstacles. When the king abdicated, he drafted many decrees, the most important of which was that the power to make the final judgment on the death penalty should be in the hands of the king. The king left many other plans for educating the people and defining the powers of parliament. (National Telegram on the 7th)</p>
<h3>Amidst Italian-Ethiopian Compromise Rumors, Italian Air Force Opens in East Africa; Governor-General of Italian Somaliland Officially Appointed</h3>

<h3>France Strengthens its Military; Naval Construction Program Submitted to Parliament Yesterday; Cabinet Discusses Extending Military Service Period</h3>
<p>(Paris) The government today proposed to the House of Representatives to build a main battleship and two 1,700-ton destroyers by the end of this year, and to begin construction of another battleship after January 1937. The tonnage of the main battleship has not been announced, but according to non-official sources, it is likely to be 35,000 tons. Some quarters say that France's move is a response to the naval turmoil that has been plaguing the world diplomatic community, in which France has been seen as a secondary player, so it is building ships as a response. France's naval status is the fourth in the world, with a total of 500,000 tons, including nine main battleships. Japan also has nine, while the United Kingdom and the United States each have fifteen. The government's request to the House of Representatives today does not exceed France's quota under the Five-Power Treaty. (National Telegraph on the 4th)</p>
<p>(Paris) At a special cabinet meeting today, a decision may be made to increase the military service period from one year to two years. This is because during the war years from 1914 to 1918, the birth rate declined, resulting in a decrease in the annual number of conscripts from 240,000 to 120,000. This will begin this year and will continue until 1939. It is believed that the radical members of the government are advocating delaying the decision until after the municipal elections on May 5, as the public is largely opposed to increasing the military service period. (Reuters dispatch on the 7th)</p>
<p>(Paris) After the cabinet met today to discuss increasing the term of military service, it issued a communiqué in the afternoon stating that no decision had been made on the matter. (Reuters dispatch on the 7th)</p>

<p>(London) The Labor Party members in the House of Commons today strongly criticized the government's White Paper on defense issues and questioned Foreign Secretary Simon on the reasons for postponing his trip to Germany.

When Simon mentioned that German Chancellor Hitler was currently suffering from a cold, Labor Party members laughed wildly. Simon replied that the German Foreign Minister had informed the British Ambassador in Berlin yesterday that the German Chancellor had caught a cold and lost his voice when returning to the Saar, so the scheduled talks with British cabinet members this week had to be postponed. The German government was very sorry for this. When asked when the talks would likely take place, Simon replied that he was in contact with the German government on this matter. Then, Labor Party leader Lansbury rose and asked if the Foreign Secretary could advise his colleagues to withdraw the White Paper pending the Anglo-German talks. Simon replied that he could not, and indeed could not. Lansbury continued to ask whether the Foreign Secretary thought that publishing an unfriendly document such as the Defense White Paper would promote friendly negotiations. Simon replied that this matter would be discussed on Monday when the House of Commons debates defense issues. Labor Party member Cox suggested that the Foreign Secretary should go to Moscow first, as the authorities there had not lost their voices, which caused much laughter and ended the discussion. According to today's news, the Labor Party will propose a vote of impeachment against the government when the House of Commons debates defense on Monday and will ask the House to express its opinion on the government's defense policy, that is, whether the government's policy is fully in line with the spirit of establishing a League of Nations to lay the foundation for collective world peace, whether it will greatly hinder any hopes for a disarmament convention, and whether it will lead to international competition and insecurity and ultimately to war. When the cabinet met this afternoon, it discussed the postponement of Simon's trip to Germany. Cabinet members believed that it would eventually take place after Hitler recovered. The Foreign Secretary's preparations for his trip to Moscow and Warsaw have not been suspended due to the postponement of his trip to Berlin, but the government still hopes that Hitler will recover soon so that Simon and Eden can go to Germany first and proceed according to the original plan.

<p>(London) Lord Privy Seal Eden will soon go to Warsaw and Moscow to conduct negotiations with the Soviet and Polish governments on the Anglo-French Declaration of February 3. On Monday, Eden will announce in the House of Commons the various preparations for his trip to Russia and Poland. As for whether German Chancellor Hitler has recovered and when Foreign Secretary Simon can go to Berlin, the response from Germany is currently awaited here. (Havas on the 7th)</p>
<p>(London) The cabinet held a cabinet meeting today to discuss the situation caused by Foreign Secretary Simon's postponement of his trip to Germany. As a result, it was decided that the British government's proposal to send representatives to Moscow and Warsaw should not be hindered by Hitler's illness. If Herr Hitler's health recovers within days and he is prepared to meet with Foreign Secretary Simon and Lord Privy Seal Eden, then Simon and Eden will still travel to Germany first. Regarding this matter, Simon and Berlin are currently in communication. British officials are unwilling to question the reasons given by Hitler for requesting the postponement of the Anglo-German talks (referring to Herr Hitler's illness), but they are quite surprised by the attacks launched by German newspapers against the British government after the publication of the White Paper on defense policy. Some figures regarding Germany's rearmament have been circulating here. It is said that at the end of 1934, Germany's military expenditures and the expenses of military groups other than the regular army increased by more than 1,100,000,000 marks compared to 1933, while the increase listed in the budget was only 605,000,000 marks. The total military budget reached 2,000,000,000 marks, which exceeds the British defense budget. Now Germany is expressing indignation at the British budget, which is completely unreasonable.

<h3>The Rebellious Faction Resorts to Defiant Resistance; Greek National Army Begins Offensive; Air Force Heavily Bombs Rebel Positions, Inflicting Severe Damage; Venizelos Sails Towards the Mediterranean by Ship</h3>
<p>Athens - Because the rebel faction refused the ultimatum, the government has launched a final and forceful suppression. This morning, government troops, after a fierce bombardment, crossed the Struma River and launched a strong attack on enemy positions. As it is the dead of winter, the rebels are in dire straits and may not be able to hold out for long. The government troops are personally commanded by General Kondylis. Before the government troops launched their offensive, they used aircraft to heavily bomb the area near Kavala on the Macedonian coast, where the rebels were heavily concentrated, inflicting severe damage. When the planes dropped bombs from the sky and strafed the streets with machine guns at low altitude, the 50,000 residents of the town were greatly alarmed. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<p>Alexandria - News received here this morning stated that two cruisers occupied by Greek rebels are now heading towards this port. Former Prime Minister Venizelos is also said to be on board. This caused great shock among the people. The Egyptian government has today ordered that if the Greek rebel ships seek refuge in the port of Alexandria, the weapons of the crew members should be confiscated, the breechblocks of the cannons removed, and their ammunition confiscated. Police are stationed at all key points in the city to prevent demonstrations by those who sympathize with the Greek revolution and Venizelos's party. Meanwhile, according to a Reuters correspondent in Athens, one of the cruisers belonging to the rebels has arrived off the coast of Dattilo Island in the Aegean Sea today. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<p>General Offensive Delayed Due to Bad Weather</p>
<p>(Vienna) According to the latest news from Athens, the reason why yesterday's general offensive could not be carried out was due to bad weather. However, it will definitely be held within the next 24 hours. Currently, both sides are doing their best to strengthen their fighting power in preparation for the decisive battle. (National Telegram, 7th)</p>
<p>Salonika, Greece - The Minister of the Army, Kondylis, issued the following public announcement at 8 PM tonight: Although the weather is currently extremely cold, government troops are continuing to advance towards the front lines. The transportation of supplies to the rear has not been obstructed. By noon today, the weather gradually improved. A large squadron of bombers attempted to fly to the enemy's position, but due to cloud cover, they were unable to take action and immediately returned. However, two of the planes bravely broke through the clouds and dropped bombs on the enemy barracks in Serres and the enemy troops in Xigalkebanli from a low altitude of 20 meters above the ground. The rebels in Serres are now in a state of chaos. According to news from Eastern Macedonia Province, the rebels have been routed one after another, and the situation is extremely dire. At the Aliakmon River front line, the rebel forces are weak and cannot stand against the government troops. If the weather is clear tomorrow, the government troops can make a major advance. In short, the only reason for not immediately suppressing the rebellion is the weather. As for suppressing the turmoil, it is no longer a problem. The people of Salonika are now quietly awaiting the development of events and have consistently expressed their trust in the government. The first batch of those who died in the previous conflict with the rebels were buried at 2 PM today. The public all went to the funeral to express their opposition to the rebellion. (Havas, 6th)</p>
<p>The Government is Confident of Victory</p>
<p>Athens - Since the Minister of the Army, Kondylis, personally led his troops to the front lines, the progress of the army has been affected by the bad weather. However, Kondylis declared that he has decided to fight the rebels to the finish in Serres. Last night, there was heavy rain and snow here, and tonight there is a thick layer of fog. The rebel position is only ten miles away from the national army. According to Kondylis, only 2,000 of the rebels have adequate weapons. Even at the time of battle, if the rebels increase their forces to 10,000, the government can mobilize 100,000, so victory is practically assured. The leaders of the national army have sent a telegram to the Prime Minister, stating that the discipline and morale of the national army are perfect, and that the rebels can be annihilated when the weather clears up in the coming days. Within the capital, all traces of rebellion have been eliminated, and about a thousand people with suspicious behavior have been arrested. Military officers who have not gained the full trust of the government have also been replaced. The arsenals are repairing the warships destroyed by the rebels day and night. Today, the government reissued a decree that the property of all rebel personnel and their relatives will be confiscated, all Greek ships are prohibited from entering Greek ports, and foreign ships will also be subject to strict inspection. (National Telegram, 6th)</p>
<p>Success or Failure Will Be Determined Imminently</p>
<p>Athens - The Prime Minister of Greece, Tsaldaris, recently issued a declaration stating, "The rebel faction has disrupted the country, and their crimes are obvious. The government is now suppressing them with a large army. Success or failure will be determined imminently. I dare to resolutely assert that the government will be completely victorious. Recently, in the Macedonia area, due to the severe cold and dense fog, military operations around Salonika have inevitably encountered difficulties. However, today, the government troops are still advancing steadily and have achieved their marching objectives. The government troops are far superior to the rebels in terms of numbers and equipment, and reinforcements and supplies are now coming in a steady stream. If the rebel faction continues to refuse to surrender, the government will use the force of thunder to wipe them out in one fell swoop." (Havas, 6th)</p>
<p>The Prime Minister Declares the Preservation of the Republic</p>
<p>Athens - The Prime Minister, Tsaldaris, recently made a statement to a representative of Havas, saying, "The leader of the rebel faction, former Prime Minister Venizelos, has claimed that the purpose of this armed rebellion is to defend the republican system in order to prevent danger. This excuse is completely unfounded and not worth a laugh. I have repeatedly declared that the Greek state system has long been undisputed, and no one is threatening the republican system. If the republic itself is in danger, it is entirely caused by Venizelos and his followers. Since the Greek people lost confidence in the Venizelos faction, the strategies and actions taken by the faction have all proven its contempt for the republican system and the freedom of the people."

<p>General Plastiras Still Lingers in Italy</p>
<p>Brindisi, Italy - Former Greek dictator General Plastiras arrived here some days ago from Cannes in southern France, intending to return to his country to take action, but because air traffic between here and Athens and Salonika has been cut off, his plan has been thwarted.

<h3>Roosevelt Expresses No Intention to Further Reduce the Value of Currency; The Time is Not Yet Ripe to Stabilize Prices</h3>
<p>(Washington) - President Roosevelt told reporters at the White House this afternoon that the international effort to provide China with loans is under consideration, but in the past half month, he has not heard of any progress in this matter. President Roosevelt continued to talk about prices but declined to comment on the suggestion of continuing to reduce the gold value of the dollar. He said the government hopes to reduce the burden of debt, but he feels that prices have not yet reached a sufficient level to make this burden relatively lighter. Therefore, he believes that the time is not yet ripe to stabilize domestic prices. Several sources in New York believe that President Roosevelt's statement is a veiled reference to the British monetary authorities, meaning that the pound is so low that it may suppress American prices, in which case the United States will take retaliatory action to deal with it. However, Wall Street is quite confused about the true meaning of President Roosevelt's remarks, because last autumn President Roosevelt also made similar remarks about raising prices. (Reuters, 6th)</p>
<p>(Washington) - President Roosevelt spoke with reporters this morning, and speculators may have misunderstood the President's meaning. This afternoon, White House aides claimed that the President had no intention of further reducing the value of the dollar, and there was absolutely no hint in the President's statement that could be interpreted as implying a reduction in the value of the dollar. When the President spoke with reporters, he said that he believed the purchasing power of the dollar could still be adjusted to reduce people's debts. Although the debt burden has been reduced a lot, it is still far from enough. At that time, someone asked if the President meant to reduce the value of the dollar again, but the President smiled and shook his head. Some believe that the President's words indicate a desire to raise domestic prices without affecting the value of the dollar. The government has adopted two methods to adjust the domestic economic situation: first, to reduce debt; second, to raise prices. However, the President did not indicate to what extent prices must be raised, and at present, due to the drought and the Agricultural Adjustment Administration's plan, food prices have risen very quickly, but other items are still slightly behind.

<h3>Hungarian Election Campaign; Gömbös and the Constitutionalists Become Formidable Opponents</h3>
<p>Budapest - All parties are now doing their best in the election campaign. The primary election is approximately on March 31, and the secondary election is on April 6. Because there is ample time, all parties can make full preparations for the issues in dispute. Prime Minister Gömbös met with Christian Social Economic Party leader Wolff today, and the two talked for a long time. According to those familiar with the situation, not only will Wolff support Gömbös, but also Smallholders Party leader Eckhardt will form a common front with Gömbös. Now, the eyes of the general public are focused on former Prime Minister Bethlen, but it is still unclear which direction Bethlen's actions will take. It is likely that he will lead the opposition to defend Hungary's constitutional system of more than a thousand years. The order prohibiting gatherings will likely be lifted tomorrow. Judging from the editorials of various newspapers, although there are a dozen or so political parties participating in this election, the formidable opponents are Gömbös and Bethlen. It is predicted that there will be a fierce battle. (National Telegram, 7th)</p>

<h3>A Report on the Northwest Inspection</h3>
<p>— Special correspondent for this newspaper, Geng Ya</p>
<p>An Overview of the Changes and Turmoil in Xinjiang This Year (6)</p>
<p>The new government of Xinjiang, born after the April 12th coup, will soon be celebrating its second anniversary. Looking back at the past year and a half, it can be said that it has been constantly battered. Now, the new government's new life has gradually improved. That is, the control of political and military power by Governor Sheng Shicai alone has become increasingly consolidated. However, the new government's ability to gain this new life can be said to have come from so-called "difficult creation, tragic management." Since its birth, the new government has not only had a major adversary in Ma Zhongying, who fought with it for more than a year, but also the internal strife among the central figures of the new government has been one wave after another. As for the ephemeral, almost twin-born independent government of Southern Xinjiang, its small history worthy of exploration has not yet been written. The Southern Xinjiang Hui people, Temir, and others suddenly raised the flag of an independent government in Kashgar. The news spread within China about its self-generation and self-destruction, which was inconsistent. However, the Hui people in Hami who had previously communicated with them said, "The establishment of the government is intended to achieve the goal of self-government by the people of Xinjiang under the guidance of the central government. The leader of the government, Timur, once said, 'A young colt that is not yet strong suddenly leaves home and escapes. If it encounters a wolf, it will undoubtedly have its lips greased. It is known that the people of Xinjiang still cannot completely leave the embrace and support of the central government and seek a dangerous path to survival.' Therefore, the new copper coins cast by the government are printed with the Kuomintang emblem, and the new flags erected also bear the Chinese national flag. This is not a false rumor. The attitude and meaning of the government can be clearly understood here." The government was destroyed long ago. The details of the process have been seen in various newspapers. Now, listening to the above, one can gain a better understanding of the general situation.</p>
<p>Yang Zengxin said that the ancient saying "There are no old friends west of Yangguan" should change the word "old" to "good". The new people also said that the new provincial rule is a paradise in times of peace and a deadly place in times of chaos. The former is Yang's many years of experience in governing Xinjiang, and the latter is derived from observing the geography. Both have their own objective appropriateness. It can be seen that the personnel in Xinjiang are complex and the environment is special, which cannot be compared with the inland. The aforementioned changes in the mountainous areas and the war with Sheng Ma, as well as the truth about the repeated infighting among the important figures in the new government, all seem unable to escape its criteria.</p>
<p>In addition to the internal strife within the new government, in June 1933, Tao Mingyue, Li Xiaotian, Chen Zhong, and others brewed the so-called "Second Coup," which has been mentioned in previous articles. After that, two major anti-Sheng organizations continued to be exposed. Most of the people engaged in this activity were close confidants of Sheng who had kinship with him. The president of the new government, Liu Wenlong, was also among them, which is no wonder outsiders find it shocking. Even Sheng himself could not figure it out at first.</p>
<p>The first organization to expose the opposition to Sheng was in October 1933. The main members were Zheng Runcheng, the former leader of the National Salvation Army (then the commander of the Dihua city defense), Yang Yaojun, the leader of the Self-Defense Army, Li Danchu, the director of the military factory, and Gmilek, the director of the Automobile Bureau, and twenty-five others. Liu Wenlong was among them. It was rumored that Liu had participated in the second coup by Tao, Li, and Chen. Upon hearing the news of Tao's execution, he turned pale for a long time. However, Liu and others were chairmen, and Sheng was not in a position to deal with them. He only tried to win over the converted troops that he had been raising. Liu had no way to deal with himself and politely asked Lian Lanpu to visit, but Sheng politely declined. This time, Liu participated again, knowing that Sheng had obtained clues, and secretly informed the mastermind's name first. Unexpectedly, Sheng issued a list, and Liu also impressively stamped it. Later, according to the list, all the people were imprisoned. The provincial government hastily announced that Liu had requested sick leave and was replaced by Zhu Fenglou, the director of the Department of Finance, as the acting chairman.</p>
<p>After Liu requested sick leave, he was initially placed under house arrest in the third hall of the provincial government, which was originally the residence of the former chairman Jin Shuren, with luxurious equipment and valuable objects worth more than 200,000 yuan. Jin fled alone, and Liu immediately moved in with his family. After the incident, the "Confiscated Property Clearance Committee" sent personnel to check the objects. Liu tried his best to resist and shouted while lying on the ground, "You are so unreasonable, are you trying to force me to my death?" However, he was finally forced to move back to his private residence. Liu had served in lucrative positions in eight cities in Southern Xinjiang and had a large fortune. He often engaged in commerce and lending. In Ili and Tacheng, he had 100,000 sheep. When Ma Zhongying was about to besiege Dihua, the public discussed quickly moving government grain into the city, but Liu opposed it to no avail. Later, when grain prices soared after the city was besieged, Liu calmly opened his private granary and sold it at a good price. He was so skilled at accumulating wealth that it was rumored that he had more than one million taels of silver at home, but they were all handled by the Clearance Committee. There were many other "confiscated properties" that were cleared, among which those of Jin Shuren (accumulated during Jin's five years in Xinjiang, mostly famous antiques), Tao Mingyue, Zhang Peiyuan, and Cui Zhaoji were the most abundant. The origin of their abundance was almost entirely from extortion. In addition, there were many Han officials and civilians who were victims of the Hui rebellions in various counties in Southern Xinjiang. However, according to those who escaped from the war, the truly honest and people-loving county magistrates were treated differently and were not all destroyed. Illicit gains come with illicit losses. There is an ancient saying that those who govern the people should know how to conduct themselves.</p>
<p>In the first half of 1934, most of the troops were sent to Southern Xinjiang to clean up the remnants of Ma and suppress various things. Sheng himself did not leave Dihua lightly, and it was still peaceful and uneventful. However, in September, Su Shangda, the general manager of the New Xinjiang Bank, who was known as the "Second Governor," was suddenly arrested and imprisoned, and the atmosphere suddenly became tense again. Those who were implicated included Jin, a section chief of the Department of Construction, Liu, the director of the Automobile Bureau, Chen, the captain of the Boy Scout team, and six others. The details of the case have not yet been announced. There are various rumors circulating outside. Some say that Su and others secretly bought guns and plotted to assassinate Sheng, and the matter was leaked. Some say that this was the result of a secret struggle between the two factions of those who studied in Japan (Sheng's representative) and those who studied in the United States (Su's representative). According to Wang Guoguang, the director of the Radio Station, Sheng and Su had a close personal friendship, but they had different political views, which forced them to take this action. However, no matter what, they were both anti-Sheng.</p>
<p>Looking at the New Xinjiang April 12th Coup, the execution of Tao, Li, and Chen, Liu Wenlong's house arrest, Zhang Peiyuan's attack on the provincial government, and Su Shangda's arrest, the new people constantly mentioned them together and called them the "Five Revolutions." When the fifth incident was exposed, the current chairman Li Rong (Zhu Fenglou had already resigned) discussed with Sheng about issuing passports to Shanxi so that dissidents could leave at their own convenience. For a time, officials and civilians enthusiastically applied for passports. The last time, three new Sui automobiles departed directly from Dihua eastward (after which they would travel from Sui to Hami). Tickets were sold out a dozen days ago. On the way from Dihua to Hami, the Kazakhs killed and robbed people. From Dihua to Turpan, the short journey of six stations cost 200,000 taels of paper money to hire a cart (approximately 400 yuan in current currency), but no one dared to accept the order. In the area of Qijiaojing east of the road, one had to hire a Kazakh soldier to escort them. There were even fewer people riding camels. Before long, the order to stop issuing passports was issued again. Therefore, those who were able to return to Hami rejoiced with the phrase "enter Yumen Pass alive."</p>
<p>At present, the internal situation in New Xinjiang is due to the fact that the strength of the opposition parties such as Ma Zhongying and Zhang Peiyuan has been eliminated one after another, and the new provincial government has given priority to employing the leaders of various ethnic groups (especially the Hui people), such as the vice chairman of the provincial government, the vice directors of various departments, the administrative chiefs of various districts, and the division and brigade commanders of the governor's office, all of whom are from various ethnic groups, which is able to appease people's hearts. On the anniversary of the April 12th Revolution, Sheng said, "The situation in New Xinjiang is special. Only when the military plan is realized can political guarantees be achieved." Now, generally speaking, the new authorities have indeed managed to end the military and concentrate power. From now on, if they are not affected by external forces or unexpected changes, and on the one hand, they work harder to build and attach importance to the interests of various ethnic groups, then the future is immeasurable.</p>
<h3>Zhu and Mao Trapped in Zunyi; Xu Bandit Front Also Wavering</h3>
<p>Hankou Communication: Zhu De, Mao Zedong, Peng Dehuai, and other remnant bandits fled westwards to the Yunnan border some time ago, attempting to break into Leibo and Ebian counties, occupy western Sichuan, threaten Chengdu if they advanced, and use it as a base for rest. However, the Yunnan army strictly blocked them at the junction of Weixin and Zhenxiong, inflicting heavy casualties on the bandits, who then fled back to the border of Sichuan and Guizhou. The bandits, after wandering through several provinces, were exhausted. They initially intended to cross the Jinsha River to connect with the Xu bandits in northern Sichuan. Having failed to pass through Yunnan, they had no choice but to change their plans and cross the Wu River southward to join forces with the He bandits in western Hunan. The bandit suppression troops, aware of their intentions, defended the Wu River line while launching a joint encirclement. At the beginning of this month, the bandits fled to Zhongzhuang and Huangnipu near Zunyi, and the situation in northern Guizhou became tense again. However, as the bandits arrived in Zunyi, various armies followed closely. The National Army advanced rapidly in three routes and has surrounded the bandits. A portion of them fled to Suiyang, attempting to break through to Meitan and Fengquan, but the Wu River blocked their path, making it impossible to escape into Hunan. At this time, the He Long and Xiao Ke bandits also broke out of Dayong, fleeing westwards to Yuanling and Luxi, intending to meet Zhu and Mao. However, the National Army's defense line was solid, preventing them from passing through. The Hunan and Hubei armies redoubled their efforts to suppress them, making it possible to annihilate these bandits. He Jian, the commander-in-chief of the first route of pursuit and suppression, originally departed from Hunan on the 2nd to come to Hankou to meet Chiang Kai-shek and seek instructions. However, hearing that Chiang Kai-shek had gone to Chongqing, he turned back to Changsha and went directly to Changde to supervise the suppression. After He and Xiao are cleared, he will lead a large army into Guizhou to pursue them. When the Xu Zhang and other bandits in northern Sichuan were under the second general suppression by the Sichuan army, internal strife had already occurred. The military faction, including Xu Xiangqian, advocated defending Tongnan, Ba, Cangxi, and Yi counties, taking Jiange in the north, and eyeing Suining in the south. The political faction, including Zhang Guotao, advocated abandoning northern Sichuan and fleeing to Shaanxi and Gansu. Subsequently, the Zhang bandits fled north to Guangyuan and Nanzheng without success, and the Xu bandits also lost Tong, Ba, Cang, and Yi. All plans failed.

<h3>Anhui Construction Department Plans to Repair Three Major Water Conservancy Projects – Huayang River, Shao Weir, Chaohu Lake –</h3>
<p>Anqing Communication: In order to prevent the backflow of river water in the Huayang River area, and to connect the Shao Weir and dredge Chaohu Lake, the Anhui Provincial Construction Department plans to launch the Huayang River Area Consolidation Project, the Diversion Project, and the Chaohu Lake Dredging Project. All the plans have been drafted and are being actively prepared. Construction will begin soon. The following is a summary of the plan:</p>
<p>(A) The Huayang River Water Conservancy Area covers more than 8,000 square kilometers, spanning the jurisdictions of Hubei, Anhui, and Jiangxi provinces, with Anhui province accounting for the majority. The people of this province have suffered disasters repeatedly. Since the beginning of the Republic of China, they have jointly conducted consolidation movements with Hubei and Jiangxi provinces. Subsequently, the central government sent personnel to supervise the project, with Anhui province as the main body. Due to insufficient funding, no achievements have been made. This province, based on repeated requests from the people, continued to raise funds for consolidation. After organizing a survey team for measurement and design, it was confirmed that the cost was not much, but the benefits were enormous. It is estimated that after consolidation, the following can be obtained: (1) 1.1 million mu of dried fields, estimated at 15 yuan per mu, worth 16.5 million yuan; (2) 298,000 mu of benefited fields, with an estimated increase of 5 yuan per mu, worth 1.49 million yuan. The total value of both items is 17.99 million yuan. The increase in agricultural production for the people and the increase in tax revenue for the government are not included. The construction methods are: (1) Construction of a 200-meter-long earth dam; (2) Construction of three reinforced concrete culverts; (3) Construction of one ship lock; (4) Dredging of internal river channels; (5) Construction of dikes around the lake; (6) Construction of bank protection works connecting the river dikes to the gate; (7) Repair of the Ma Hua Dike. The total cost of the project is estimated to be 1.022974 million yuan. The seventh item, the Ma Hua Dike, has already been repaired, which can save 150,000 yuan, so the remaining amount is 1.872974 million yuan. It is divided into three phases to implement. The first phase will first implement items one, three, four, and three, requiring 542,917 yuan.</p>
<p>(B) The Shao Weir in Shouxian County, northern Anhui, was created in the Spring and Autumn period. It is said by Chu Prime Minister Sun Shuao, as an ancient famous water conservancy area. Its operation is earlier than the Northwest Qin Canal, Han Canal, Zheng Canal, and Bai Canal. Initially, it irrigated 1 million mu, or said to be 4 million mu. Over time, it gradually became obsolete. Today, only more than 100,000 mu of irrigation area remain. Its water source is one to draw water from the Pi River and the other to receive mountain water. Due to the blockage of the diversion route, the irrigation area is shrinking day by day. The Anhui Provincial Government is seeking to restore the old view and sent personnel to survey and design it. Its construction methods are: A. Dredge the bottom of the channel that diverts the Pi River to one meter below the low water level, the channel bottom is four meters wide, and build a flood control gate; B. Dredge the channel bottom to half a meter below the low water level, two meters wide, and extend the original spillway dam. Type A requires an engineering fee of 121,231 yuan, and Type B requires 61,043 yuan. It is now proposed to adopt the Type A method and allocate funds for implementation.</p>
<p>(C) Chaohu Lake is located in the hinterland of Anhui Province, with an area of 2,800 square kilometers. It collects water from counties such as He, Chao, Shu, and Lu, with a vast basin of about 10,000 square kilometers. It borders the long Huai River in the north and the big Yangtze River in the south. Its main waterway carries the first heavy town of Hefei in the upstream, passes through Shikou, Chaoxian, Yunchao, and reaches Hexian's Yuxikou to enter the river. Its important tributaries take the route from Sanhe Town upstream to towns such as Fengle, Xincang, and Taoxi, reaching Shucheng and Lu'an. The agricultural water conservancy around the lake for hundreds is extremely important. The output of grain, tea, hemp and other items from Lu'an, Hefei and other all take this road. Since the blockage of the lake entrance, the traffic is blocked bricks, its Shikou one place, there is a very large silt beach, across the lake mouth, winter water dry, Heng with cattle dragging ships, is very inconvenient. Its construction plan is to dredge from Zhongmiao via Shikou to Hefei County, about 55 kilometers long. Inside (1) Zhongmiao to Shikou section of 20 kilometers, the average dredging depth of 2 meters, about 560,000 cubic meters of excavation, with dredger excavation, (2) Shikou to Hefei section of thirty-five kilometers, the average dredging depth of 1 meter, about 300,000 cubic meters of excavation, the first section of dredger excavation, each cubic meter to 1.5 cents, the need for 84,000 yuan, the second section of artificial excavation, each cubic meter to 1 dime, the need for 30,000 yuan, two together need 114,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The above plan has recently been resolved at the Standing Committee of the Provincial Government, allocating 100,000 shi of relief rice and 160,000 yuan of relief funds, and choosing to do urgent work to relieve disasters. It is heard that the Provincial Government has decided to allocate 1,700 shi of relief rice and 10,000 yuan of construction funds to the Pi River, allocate 2,500 shi of relief rice and 50,000 yuan of construction funds to Chaohu Lake, and allocate 2,000 shi of relief rice and 100,000 yuan of construction funds to the Huayang River, which will be handled separately by the Construction Department in order to complete them.

<h3>Japanese Purchase and Transport of Qin and Han Bricks and Tiles Case Concluded - The Entire Value Is No Less Than a City - Compensation for the Price Settled Locally</h3>
<p>Jinan Communication: Shandong is the land of Qilu, the birthplace of Confucius and Mencius, so the influence of culture and the ethos of customs have all taken the lead. Therefore, the literary style of past generations is luxuriant. In the past, during times of peace, most of the reading seeds were devoted to the collection of antiques, concentrating on textual research to show their erudition. Passing on and learning, it became a trend. For example, the Haiyuan Pavilion's collection of books in Liaocheng, the Great Sutra of Nanhai Temple in Yexian, and the bricks and tiles of Wan Yin in Weixian, although they initially arose from temporary interests, are deeply related to the culture and history of our country. It is a great pity that their descendants could not inherit the legacy of their predecessors, cherish and treasure them, and collude with foreigners due to domestic unscrupulous merchants, dazzled by high prices, and the great national treasure was lost and flowed into foreign lands, which is very lamentable. The Haiyuan Pavilion's collection of books and the treasures of Wanyinlou were damaged, sold, and no longer belonged to Shandong Province. The Qin and Han bricks and tiles were also extremely valuable. Unexpectedly, the descendants of the Gao family could not inherit the mantle of their predecessors. In mid-May of the twentieth year of the Republic of China, they sold all the bricks and tiles to Ota, a famous Japanese antique dealer. The introducer was a Mr. Gong. The selling price was only 2,500 yuan. Mr. Gong received 900 yuan, and the Gao family only received 1,600 yuan. With this small amount of money, they actually ruined the only national treasure. The representative of the Japanese acquisition was named Kuhara. He divided the bricks and tiles into five large boxes in Weixian and secretly transported them to Qingdao. They were shipped from May 17th of that year and arrived in Qing on the 18th. The matter was heard by the Shandong Provincial Library. They immediately telegraphed the Qingdao Municipal Government, the Education Bureau, the Social Bureau, and the Jiaoji Railway Administration, stating that the bricks and tiles were related to national culture and requested that they be detained in accordance with the Law on the Preservation of Antiquities. On the 22nd, a telegram was received from the Jiaoji Railway stating that the antiques transported by Ota were two steles and five boxes of Han bricks and tiles, which were indeed treasures and had been temporarily detained. The Education Department sent Wu Jingshou to Qingdao to negotiate so that the antiques could be transported back to Jinan, and telegraphed the Ministry of Education to report. When Wu arrived in Qingdao, he found out that two of the twelve-character bricks had been taken away by the Japanese, leaving only one and other bricks and tiles. He negotiated to transport them to Jinan. Unexpectedly, the Japanese Chief of the Traffic Department of the Jiaoji Railway, Kagasawa Manabu, refused. After repeated negotiations, the antiques were transported from Qing to Jinan on June 14th. On the 16th, the Provincial Government sent Secretary Ren Fenggang and Liu Runmin, together with Pi Songyun, Chief of the Third Section of the Education Department, and Wang Xiantang, Director of the Provincial Library, to be responsible for checking. A total of 531 bricks and tiles and two portraits were displayed in the library. The history of the bricks and tiles was originally that Gao Qingling, a collector of antiques in Weixian, Shandong Province in the Qing Dynasty, collected about seven or eight hundred pieces of Qin and Han bricks and tiles, which were the essence of the national ancient bricks and tiles and the only crystallization of the history of Chinese pottery culture. Gao wrote the book "Shang Tao Shi Bricks and Tiles Wen," to record the matter. The book has a total of 24 large volumes, all of which are rubbings, about two feet long and eight inches wide. The Shandong Provincial Library purchased one of them for 350 yuan. The most valuable brick and tile is the twelve-character brick, with the twelve characters "The sea is full of ministers, and the year is mature, and there is no hungry person." The brick is square, each side is eight inches long, and it is placed in a wooden box. The text on the box is written by Wang Yirong, which reads, "The twelve characters are all special words, obtained by Hansheng, and ordered to be made in the Qin Dynasty. Weng Ge Xue said that the era is determined by the text, and he is about to use this sentence to celebrate the current Tianjia. Yi Rong Ji," Gao Hansheng was the son of Gao Qingling, and he wrote a poem attached to it. The value of all the bricks and tiles is no less than a city of jade.</p>
<p>After the bricks and tiles were detained, the Japanese negotiated repeatedly, and the Japanese ambassador negotiated with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of our country. After a delay of four years, the Provincial Government received two telegrams from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Dongshi, ordering the case to be quickly settled locally through consultation, and the settlement of the case was reported for record. The Provincial Government ordered the Education Department to review and report. After the Education Department, in accordance with the claims of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, drafted measures and submitted them to the Provincial Government for approval. It was then submitted to the Political Affairs Conference on the 5th and resolved. The original text of the Education Department's proposal is copied below, "The Education Department presented that it received two telegrams from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Dongshi, regarding the case of Japanese nationals purchasing Gao's antiques in Weixian being detained, ordering that the case be quickly settled locally through consultation in accordance with the method of compensating for the price, and the settlement of the case be reported to the Ministry for record, etc. Upon receiving this, it was found that this case is related to foreign affairs, and it seems that the Provincial Government can send personnel to consult with the Japanese Consul stationed in Jinan in accordance with the claims of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and give the original purchaser a considerable amount of compensation based on the transaction price of 2,500 yuan for the antiques, so as to settle the case. The reason for submitting this for approval is to ask for a public decision," (5th)</p>
<h3>Songjiang: Zhejiang Province Sends Personnel to Take Back Refugees</h3>
<p>The Songjiang branch of the Chinese Red Cross Society has set up a refugee camp for refugees from Zhejiang. The first batch of disaster victims is planned to be sent back first. The Zhejiang Provincial Government was telegraphed to order Hai'ning County to send personnel to Songjiang to take them back. Recently, a reply was received from the Zhejiang Provincial Government, which has been transferred to be followed up. The reply from the Zhejiang Provincial Government is as follows: "Case approved, letter No. 28 of your association dated February 28 this year, on the grounds that Jiashu and other places suffered severe drought disasters last year, and farmers moved to seek food. Songjiang is close to the border of Zhejiang, and many disaster victims came. An investigation found that the most victims were from Xiashi Wangdian and other places in Hai'ning County. This association has started to take in refugees. Now that spring plowing is approaching, please order the Hai'ning County Government to send personnel to Songjiang to take them back to resume their business. This is in addition to ordering the magistrate of Hai'ning County to send personnel immediately to investigate and find ways to provide relief, and to notify the Zhejiang Relief Association. Respond to your association for information."</p>

<h3>Rice Industry Association Changes to New Measuring Instruments</h3>
<p>The county's Rice Industry Association convened an executive meeting yesterday. The chairman, Zhang Jiliang, decided that the industry would switch to the new measurement system.

The price of measuring instruments, except for the price of one-dou measuring instruments, will be calculated after production. One-sheng measuring instrument costs 4.8 cents per unit, plus a 2-cent inspection fee. There are no restrictions on the import of foreign rice, which is destroying domestic agriculture.

Because he had no heirs, Xianzhang took over both families and Peiran married him to a woman named Li. He had two children each. However, Xianzhang liked to spend money lavishly and spent more than 4,000 yuan in three months, resulting in a debt-ridden situation. Peiran refused to take care of it for him. Xianzhang felt unable to make up for it and developed a pessimistic attitude towards life. He came to Wuxi the day before yesterday afternoon and stayed in room 67 of the Wuxi Hotel. That night, he wrote a letter, gave it to the waiter to mail, and then closed the door and slept peacefully. At about 9:00 am yesterday, Xianzhang had not yet gotten up.

The Jinghu Railway Bureau stated that passengers from the Jiangbei Jingjiang, Dongtai, and Taixing areas used to take Dada and Datong Jianglun to Shanghai from the waterway. Since the Joint Transportation of Passengers was handled by the two Road Administration Bureaus and the Xicheng Automobile Company, passengers from Jiangbei to Shanghai switched to automobiles due to economic travel time reasons, and transferred to fourth-class cars to Shanghai from Xihuan. The business of the two roads has therefore flourished day by day. Recently, the Provincial Department of Construction is working on opening the Huangtiangang. The Road Bureau believes that this project is extremely important for passengers from Dajiangnan.

<p>Letter to Women</p>
<p>International Women's Day Letter to Women, Dear Sisters, Time passes quickly, it is again "March 8th" (omitted) Since "September 18th" to this day, China is fragmented, the countryside is bankrupt, externally there is strong aggression, internally there are continuous wars, Japanese imperialism, in addition to its military aggression, is rapidly carrying out its economic aggression against China, in order to fulfill its dream of a continental policy, China, increasingly ruined by colonialism, is about to step onto the final stage of being completely devoured or jointly managed. In other words, the fate of the Chinese nation is on the verge of life and death. Women cannot exist independently from the nation, nor can they seek solutions to their own problems independently from the nation's survival. Therefore, Chinese women, in addition to struggling for their own liberation, should also strive for the national liberation movement. "March 8th" is a day when women around the world jointly seek liberation. In the eyes of women who have already been liberated, it is good news, and the formal commemoration is, of course, a celebration. However, in the eyes of Chinese women under heavy oppression, it can only be a warning sign, and the expression that comes with this warning sign is the spirit of going to war and the determination to resist. Sisters, rise up together, unite closely, continue the spirit of the enlightened and strive, shoulder the unfinished mission of our predecessors, resist feudal forces, overthrow imperialism, and promote women's liberation, human equality, and world peace. Respectfully issued by the Shanghai Women's Association.</p>

<p>Business Report</p>
<p>At the beginning of the 23rd year, Shanghai's silver deposits were as abundant as before. Weekly warehouse inspection reports showed increasing silver, seemingly indicating prosperity. However, examining the source, most of it was the price paid for purchasing foreign goods from the interior. Because the income from production was not enough to offset it, it was necessary to transport silver to Shanghai. The relaxation of Shanghai's finances was a reflection of the financial depletion of the interior. In other words, every province, county, town, village was importing more than exporting. Once silver arrived in Shanghai, part of it was no longer owned by Chinese people. However, before leaving the country, it could still be a medium for domestic transactions, but it had the opportunity to drift away at any time. Our industry colleagues silently observed such a twisted form of relaxation and decided that it could not last. On the one hand, we tried to develop properly, and on the other hand, we always strictly guarded against the onslaught of panic. Since summer and autumn, droughts have spread everywhere, and the source of the interior has dried up. Suddenly, the United States vigorously implemented its silver purchase bill, and overseas silver prices soared. By purchasing silver in Shanghai and reselling it in overseas markets, substantial profits could be obtained. In a few months, there was a large outflow, causing panic and a sudden tightening of credit. Later, the government levied a silver tax to make it unprofitable, and the government declared the rumors of inflation to be untrue, and people's hearts were roughly settled. Our industry colleagues, in this environment, still adhered to their prudent approach and deep solidarity, and were able to maintain their modest prosperity. Whether China's economy can improve in the future depends entirely on the state of international payments. Whether silver deposits flow out or not is a secondary issue. How should we contribute to the government, guide society, rescue the countryside, and assist industry and commerce so that the amount of imports gradually decreases to balance? Our industry colleagues must have been preparing thoroughly. This is what the committee is waiting to see. The committee has been established for three years, and thanks to the supervision of colleagues, we have been able to avoid failures. In addition to maintaining the enrichment of the reserve portion, there has also been significant development in other exchange affairs. Now that it is the end of the 23rd year, we respectfully report the key points of the business situation of the past year as follows.</p>
<p>Joint Reserves</p>
<p>(A) Joint Reserve Section: (1) Admission of New Member Banks: In February of this year, Hengli Bank joined the committee as a member bank. (2) Reserve Assets: The total amount of reserve assets deposited by each bank, according to the total amount of the year-end settlement this year, is 60,071,912.04 silver dollars. The total amount of all reserves was 66.78% of the total evaluated amount in the previous settlement period and 62.91% in the next settlement period. Asset classification, according to the number of the next settlement period, real estate accounts for 85.32% of the total, foreign securities account for 9.65%, and domestic public bonds account for 5.02%. This year, there were not many real estate transactions in Shanghai. Real estate is the main part of the association's reserve assets. In the future, adjustments should be made as appropriate, seeking agility in verification. (3) Various Documents and Interbank Discount Loans: The documents received by each bank are still used to deposit various reserves or are exercised among colleagues. At the beginning of this year, the financial situation was relaxed as described above. The average interest rate for public bond loans from the association in the first half of the year was 9%, and the average discount rate was 12%. Since August, credit has tightened sharply, and the interest rate for interbank loans has gradually increased. In December, it rose sharply. On December 28, the interest rate for money shops rose to 60%. The interest rate for the association's public bond loans was 30%, and the discount rate was 34%. Throughout the year, the total amount of loans borrowed from the association by each bank was only more than 2.7 million yuan. The abundance of the strength of our colleagues can be seen in general. The public bond discount item has not been implemented this year. (4) Exchange Deposits: The average exchange deposits of exchange banks were higher in the first half of the year. Since November in the second half of the year, due to the reduction of silver deposits in the city, the amount of deposits has also decreased accordingly. The total amount of year-end deposits totaled 10,024,000 silver dollars, of which silver dollars accounted for 51.91% and remittances accounted for 48.09%. The ratio of the exchange difference to the exchange deposit averaged 1/31.05. Profits and Losses: This year, in accordance with the resolution of the 10th Delegates' Meeting of Member Banks, appropriate loans were made to ensure guarantees. The interest income was used as the association's operating fund. The total income from loan interest for the whole year was 121,653.85 yuan and the total from interbank lending was 461.11 yuan, for a total of 122,114.96 silver dollars. The budget for the reserve portion was 18,000 yuan. The amount of the final account was 18,292.37 yuan, which was 292.37 yuan higher than the budget, a decrease of 20% compared to the previous year. After amortizing equipment and start-up costs, the net profit was 94,910.57 silver dollars after offsetting profits and losses.</p>
<p>Bill Exchange</p>
<p>(B) Bill Exchange Section: (1) Progress in the Scope of Exchange: On January 4 this year, Hengli Bank joined as an exchange bank. Sichuan Meifeng Bank entrusted Xinhua Bank to act as an exchange agent from the same day. On August 1, Chouye Bank and Jiangzhe Commercial Savings Bank simultaneously joined as exchange banks. There are 15 new branches in the city that have joined the exchange one after another. In addition, the number of silver money shops in the city entrusting exchange banks to collect bills has also increased. According to the latest survey, there are more than 150 shops. (2) Exchange Volume: The total exchange volume for the whole year was 322,211,609.54 silver dollars, an increase of 64% over the previous year, and 1,627,784 bills, an increase of 80% over the previous year. The average daily exchange volume was 10,070,400 silver dollars and 5,400 bills. Comparing the monthly exchange amounts, the daily average in January, April, and May was all above 9 million yuan, the same as the highest month of the previous year, but the lowest this year. February, June, and July were all above 10 million yuan. August to November were all above 11 million yuan. By December, the daily average reached 13 million yuan, the highest record since the exchange was established. The ratio of the total exchange difference to the total exchange, calculated by combining silver dollars and remittance silver dollars, averaged 14.80%. (3) Exchange Expenses: The budget for the exchange portion of the year was 52,000 yuan. The final account was 51,298.59 yuan, a decrease of 701.41 yuan compared to the budget. Calculated according to the total amount of exchange receipts and payments for the whole year, the cost is only 7.9 li per thousand yuan of exchange bills, a decrease of 3 li compared to the previous year. In order to exempt the burden on each bank, it is proposed to pay it from the association's net profit. Executive Committee: Li Fucun (Chairman), Bei Songsun (Standing Committee Member), Tang Shoumin (Standing Committee Member), Qian Xinzhi (Standing Committee Member), Xu Jilu (Duty Committee Member), Chen Guangfu, Chen Zeqing, Wu Yunzai, Hu Bijiang, Ye Fuxiao, Sun Hengfu.

<h3>London Art Exhibition: British Commissioner to Arrive in Shanghai Tomorrow; Opening Date of Preview Exhibition Not Yet Confirmed</h3>
<p>The preparatory work for the London Exhibition of Chinese Art, including the renovation of the former Bank of China building on Rue du Consulat (Ren Ji Lu), the inventory of ancient artifacts for the exhibition transported to Shanghai from the Cathedral Street (Tian Zhu Tang Jie) and various locations, as well as the undertaking of examination and safekeeping, has kept all staff members extremely busy. Yesterday, a reporter from the Central News Agency (Zhongyang She) visited Mr. Tang Xifen, the secretary of the exhibition, to inquire about the latest developments in the preparation and the confirmed date of the exhibition, as well as concerns raised by a certain academic group regarding the safety of transporting antiquities to England for the exhibition. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>British Commissioner to Arrive in Shanghai</p>
<p>According to Mr. Tang, the London Exhibition of Chinese Art has dispatched a committee of five members to China specifically to select antiquities. Among them, Sir Percival David, the director-general of the exhibition, and Mr. Raphael have already arrived in Shanghai last month. They have also visited President Wang Jingwei and Education Minister Wang Shijie in Nanjing. They are scheduled to return to Shanghai today. In addition, Mr. Hobson and Mr. Oscar Raphael will arrive in Shanghai from Hong Kong tomorrow. Professor Paul Pelliot from France is expected to arrive on the 24th of this month.</p>
<p>Extremely Busy with Examination Work</p>
<p>Secretary Tang also stated that the examination and safekeeping committees of the exhibition, together with experienced artisans in handling antiquities, have been working in the warehouse for days to examine and safekeep the artifacts. Two photography experts have also been invited to film the selected artifacts for verification upon their return from the London exhibition and for the purpose of compiling a catalog. The total number of staff members involved is over forty. As for the confirmed date of the preview exhibition, there are varying rumors circulating. Some say it has been set for the 25th, but in reality, there is still no certainty on this end. This is because the procedures for examination and safekeeping are quite complex. Currently, efforts are being intensified in numbering and card-making, hoping to open the exhibition in the shortest possible time. It is expected to be realized around the 20th of this month. The duration of the exhibition will be approximately at least one month, but at most no more than forty days, as the venue here is scheduled for demolition in May.</p>
<p>Willing to Answer Questions on Security Concerns</p>
<p>The Central News Agency reporter then asked whether a certain academic group's concerns, recently reported in the newspapers, regarding the safety of transporting antiquities to England for the exhibition, had been addressed. Secretary Tang replied that they had not yet received any correspondence from the group. He added that he had just arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing, and that no such letters had been received in Nanjing either. However, the exhibition has always prioritized caution regarding the transportation of antiquities to England for the exhibition. Figures from various fields who are concerned about this issue, such as Mr. Tao Menghe from the North, had issued declarations as early as January and February, advocating for prudence in all matters. The exhibition has also provided essential explanations, which have been published in various newspapers. Perhaps some may not have noticed. The exhibition has formulated detailed regulations for the transportation of antiquities to England, which have been submitted to the Executive Yuan for record. The Palace Museum has also expressed its approval. If various sectors have any doubts regarding the safety of transporting antiquities to England, the exhibition is more than willing to provide detailed answers.</p>

<h3>Overseas Chinese in Fiji No Longer Enjoy Consular Jurisdiction and Must Be Subject to Chinese Courts</h3>
<p>According to the Greater Shanghai Evening News, the U.S. District Attorney in China, Watson, stated this morning (the 7th) that American courts will no longer handle cases concerning Philippine overseas Chinese as they used to. This is because the U.S. Congress recently passed a bill allowing the independence of Fiji, and Fijians are no longer U.S. citizens, but Fijian citizens. Now, if they go to the United States, they must also apply for passports from the U.S. consulates according to the methods for other foreigners. Therefore, they no longer enjoy consular jurisdiction in China and must be subject to Chinese courts.</p>

Recently, because the Ministry of Foreign Affairs sent Chen Chunpu to various parts of Southeast Asia to inspect various consulates, He Bingxian, the director of the International Trade Bureau, specially entrusted Chen to investigate the commercial situation abroad on its behalf. Yesterday, He spoke to the Central News Agency reporter about the recent trade situation and methods to save it, as follows:</p>
<p>Gathering Causes and Fundamentally Relieving</p>
<p>The decline of China's industry and commerce has led to the slump in international trade. The authorities are constantly preparing plans to save and develop it. Minister Chen previously went to Southeast Asia for inspection and returned to report that China's original market has been almost completely seized by others. He specially formulated principles and handed them over to the Bureau to find concrete ways to restore it. Now, Chen Chunpu is going to Southeast Asia for inspection again, and I have also entrusted him, out of personal friendship, to investigate the commercial situation in Southeast Asia, so as to gather causes extensively and seek fundamental relief.</p>
<p>Planning to Convene a Meeting to Save the Decline</p>
<p>The number of industrial and commercial products exported from China to Southeast Asia is very small, with only vegetables having a relatively large volume. Recently, overseas Chinese businessmen are very eager for Chinese to invest and compete there, but to save this situation, we must pool our wisdom and efforts. Therefore, the Bureau is now planning to convene the industrial and commercial sectors to jointly discuss methods to save it and seek self-improvement. All plans are in preparation and are expected to be realized in the short term.</p>
<p>Inflation Has No Impact</p>
<p>Looking at the countries around the world, although they are in an economic recession, their spirit of striving for development is admirable. China's recent trade imports and exports have decreased, but the rate of decrease in imports is greater than that in exports. The only reason for this is that the people's purchasing power is greatly reduced. Although the United States still ranks first in trade with China after implementing inflation, China's economic decline has not made special progress.</p>
<h3>Foreign Affairs Commissioner Zheng Lin Departs the Country Yesterday</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs specially sent three commissioners, Chen, Zheng, and Liang, to Southeast Asia to inspect consulates and investigate overseas Chinese affairs and commercial conditions. Chen Chunguo has already left the country on the 5th. Commissioner Zheng Lin had to handle private affairs in Shanghai, so he changed the date to yesterday and departed on the French postal ship "Athos I". Liang Yugao needs to go to Beijing for instructions and can only leave after the matter is completed.</p>
<h3>China Aviation's Large Ford Aircraft Transported to Longhua for Assembly Yesterday</h3>
<p>According to the Kwok Man News Agency, China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) is preparing to fly the newly purchased large Ford aircraft on the Chongqing-Kunming route. Yesterday morning at 8:00 AM, the aircraft was transported from the Osaka Wharf to the Longhua hangar by a lighter from Wheelock &amp; Co. (Originally, it was intended to be transported by Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. by land, but due to its bulk, a lighter was temporarily used.) It arrived around 12:00 PM and was immediately transported into the hangar for assembly. It is expected to be completed soon and tested in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Three Postal Workers' Aircraft to Be Officially Named on a Scheduled Date; Representatives from the National Postal Workers' Union to Go to Beijing for Consultation; to Be Named at the Same Time as the Children's Aircraft</h3>

A letter has been sent. Later, it was inquired when the new Breguet aircraft would arrive, or whether three other aircraft would be allocated instead. Now, a reply has been received stating that one Children's Aircraft and two Postal Workers' Aircraft have arrived, and the remaining one will arrive soon. They can be named at the same time on April 4th, etc. With this approval, in addition to sending it in two parts, it should be conveyed.

<h3>Li Tianzhen's Proposal for Spring Disaster Relief in Jiangsu Province</h3>
<p>Li Tianzhen, Deputy Director of the Jiangsu Province Disaster Relief, recently conducted on-site disaster relief in Changzhou, Zhenjiang and Nanjing counties, learning about the tragic situation of the people in the disaster areas and the urgent need for relief. Yesterday, it was heard that he had a proposal, which was sent to the Early Disaster Relief Association of the provinces. The original text is recorded below. Respectfully, I, Tianzhen, was entrusted by the conference to serve as the Deputy Director of Disaster Relief in Jiangsu Province. For more than half a year, I have been running around in the disaster areas and deeply feel that the drought suffered by various counties in Jiangsu Province last year was rare in the disaster relief in the past 20 years. The most serious ones are Liyang, Lishui, Jurong; followed by Gaochun, Jintan, Yixing, Yizheng, Liuhe; followed by Jiangpu, Zhenjiang, Wujin, Jiangdu. Although there are slight differences in comparison, the disaster situation is serious everywhere. The affected people have no food to cook, and they are lifeless. Ferns and bracken have been searched and exhausted, and it is difficult to even get enough bran and chaff to eat. They cry for hunger and cold, sell their sons and daughters, and some even flee their homes or commit suicide as a family. Among them, the number of people who died of starvation is unknown. All kinds of situations are heartbreaking to see, sad to hear, and too unbearable to describe, nor can they be fully described in writing. The suffering is that the disaster is widespread and the funds are limited. If the original number of urgent relief funds is used for inspection and release, it is really impossible to implement. As a last resort, I returned to Shanghai to make a final appeal to all parties. As a result, the counties received as much as 20,000 to 30,000 yuan, followed by only several thousand yuan. Like a cup of water to put out a cartload of burning firewood, it is still not enough. Fortunately, the Jiangsu Provincial Government has a plan to use work as disaster relief, raising huge funds to dredge rivers on a large scale. This can not only relieve the disaster temporarily, but also seek permanent benefits. It is a good idea in every way. However, only the strong men can get enough to eat, and the old, weak, women, and children cannot help but regret it. Moreover, it cannot be without worry. This work relief should be done during the winter farming season. I, Tianzhen, have been to various counties for inspection and release of urgent relief. Some of them have not yet started construction due to incomplete measurement, or because the entire project has not been approved by the provincial departments. However, now it is spring, and spring water will occur in a blink of an eye, which will obstruct dredging. The farming season is also approaching, and it is also impossible to recruit workers. Forcing to proceed will inevitably lead to abandonment halfway, wasting relief funds, and abandoning previous achievements. This is a great loss to the original intention of doing work relief. At this time of year, when the supply is not yet ready, work relief cannot be carried out, and spring relief cannot be planned, it is estimated that there are hundreds of thousands of disaster victims in each county. It is impossible to sit and wait for death, so the people's hearts are floating, which must be prevented. The disaster is so great that it is unimaginable. I, Tianzhen, dare not deliberately alarm the public, but I feel that the situation is dangerous and it is difficult to remain silent. Now, for the sake of prudent facts and weighing the advantages and disadvantages, I propose to ask the conference to approve and quickly send a telegram to the Jiangsu Provincial Government, ordering the counties that have started work on dredging rivers for work relief to complete the important projects as soon as possible within a limited time. Those that have not yet started work at all will stop working immediately. The remaining work relief funds will be distributed to the county magistrates according to the original number, ordering them to verify and distribute them to the disaster victims in each district as spring relief and for the need to purchase seeds. If this can be done, it will be of great benefit to local security. The matter is of great importance, so I dare to express my opinion. Whether it is feasible, I am extremely apprehensive and eagerly awaiting orders.</p>

<h3>### Horrific Case of Chinese Woman Beaten to Death: Concession Authorities Promise to Investigate, Shanghai West Residents Held Meeting Yesterday to Respond, Reaching Out to Party and Government Agencies for Support</h3>
<p>According to the Huadong News Agency, regarding the case of the British police officer, Stanford, from the Putuo Road Station, beating the vegetable-selling woman, Zhao Liujiali, to death on Yichang Road, the residents of Shanghai West have formed a support association for the victim. They have approached the municipal authorities and the police station to demand punishment for the perpetrator, as previously reported. Yesterday morning at 10 AM, the residents of Shanghai West held a general membership meeting at the fourth district branch of the residents' association. More than 500 merchants from Shanghai West attended. The atmosphere at the meeting was very tense. As a result, Chen Weiren, Wu Shuying, and Zhu Qizhen were appointed as representatives to visit Mr. Jullerat, the police chief of the Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department on Jiangxi Road, at 2 PM, to present the details of the incident and demand strict punishment and compensation for the offending Western police officer. Jullerat did not agree. They then went to Jiujiang Road to meet with Mr. Ansley, the deputy police chief of the Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department, to make the same request. Both police chiefs expressed their regret over the incident but stated that because they did not know the details, they would investigate and then handle the matter accordingly. If this incident occurred, they would deal with it severely according to the law. The three representatives were satisfied. They then went to the Municipal Party Headquarters, the Municipal Government, the Social Affairs Bureau, and other agencies to petition. All agencies agreed to provide support. The three representatives then left. At the same time, the fourth district branch of the Shanghai West residents' association sent a circular to residents of all districts, asking for assistance. The Shanghai Special District Residents' Federation sent a letter to the Shanghai Municipal Council yesterday regarding the unwarranted beating to death of the vegetable-selling girl, Zhao Liujiali, from Yichang Road, by a Western police officer from the Public Concession. The original letter stated: "We are writing to inform you that according to a statement from resident Zhao Yongru, who lives at 76 Zhujiawan, Zhabei, his daughter, Zhao Liujiali, was selling vegetables at the Lid You Factory Alley on Yichang Road on the morning of March 5th at approximately 7 AM. Unexpectedly, while walking, she encountered a Western police officer No. 62 from the Putuo Road Station, who, without asking why, came forward to drive her away. At that time, the woman Zhao immediately walked away to avoid him, but the Western police officer forcefully pursued her and struck her head with his fist. She immediately fell to the ground injured and was helped up by her grandmother. The Western police officer not only refused to allow her to be helped up but also punched and kicked her grandmother. She was then sent to the Guangren Hospital on Avenue Haig via ambulance, but unfortunately, she died en route. Yongru is heartbroken but feels helpless because he is powerless and his voice is not heard. Therefore, he is submitting the facts to your Federation for assistance to redress the injustice and uphold national rights. It is our understanding that if street vendors do not violate police regulations, police officers should be responsible for protecting them. If there is a violation of police regulations, they should be detained at the police station for detailed questioning to determine whether they should be punished. However, this Western police officer did not follow this procedure and instead, without asking why, arbitrarily used force to beat an innocent person, resulting in death. He treats the law like discarded straw and human life like grass. Such unfortunate incidents are caused by your Bureau's Western police officers who are familiar with the law, indicating that police training has been neglected. The brutality and unreasonableness are not in line with the civilized world, and the security of the municipality in the future is a cause for concern. In order to protect the lives of citizens and the safety of the municipality, our Federation cannot remain silent. We hereby lodge a serious protest, demanding prompt punishment of the perpetrator, compensation, and an apology to our government authorities. Please do not disregard this and provide a reply." The Federation also sent letters to the Chinese Ratepayers' Association of the Concession and the Chinese Directors to jointly lodge protests to facilitate the process.</p>

<h3>### Li Guojie Case to be Tried: Court Hearing Set for the 30th of This Month at the District Court</h3>
<p>Mr. Li Guojie, the former general manager of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, was accused of embezzlement and misappropriation of large sums of money two years ago. He was sentenced to imprisonment by the District Court. Li was dissatisfied with the result and appealed to the Jiangsu High Court, but was still dissatisfied. He then appealed to the Supreme Court in Nanjing. Li himself was being treated at the Shanghai Hospital on the Santai Wharf in the Nanshi due to illness. For the sake of caution, the Municipal Public Security Bureau sent two inspectors and two detectives, along with four police officers from the fourth squadron, to take turns monitoring him day and night for nearly two years. Last November, the Supreme Court specially held a hearing at the Shanghai District Court. Presiding Judge Hu Shancheng, together with Prosecutor Shen Bingqian, held a public hearing in the first criminal court. As the provided evidence still required investigation, the session was adjourned for further inquiry. A reporter from Guowen News Agency recently learned from Li's defense lawyer, Jiang Yiping, that the Supreme Court's second summons has been issued and a hearing is scheduled for 1 PM on the 30th of this month at the District Court.</p>
<h3>### International Trade Bureau Introduces Domestic Goods</h3>

The Bureau's address is on the fourth floor of the Bank of China Building at the north end of the new garbage bridge on Suzhou Creek.</p>
<h3>### Suicide of Nursing Student at Red Cross Hospital No. 2: Fearing Layoffs, He Secretly Took Poison, Rescue Efforts Failed, Resulting in Death</h3>
<p>Lu Xiyao, a nursing student at the Chinese Red Cross Hospital No. 2 on Xinzha Road, was from Suiyuan. He was 23 years old. He was one of the orphans recruited from the north and brought to Shanghai for care by the Association in the autumn of the 18th year of the Republic. Because of his quiet character and careful conduct, he was recruited as a nursing student by the hospital director, Wang Peiyuan. Recently, he was assigned to the pharmacy to learn formulation, and his work was making progress. His monthly salary was six yuan. He often lamented his tragic life and the fact that he could not afford clothes in addition to paying for night school tuition with his monthly salary. Recently, the Association received instructions from the Ministry of Interior to tighten expenses and reduce the budget from two thousand five or six hundred yuan to one thousand five hundred yuan. This would inevitably lead to layoffs and salary cuts. Therefore, the student, anticipating being laid off and facing a lonely and wandering life, secretly entered the pharmacy the night before (the 4th), stole poison, and went to his dormitory to commit suicide. When the hospital director checked on his work the next morning, he assumed that the student had not yet gotten up and ordered a servant to wake him in his room. Only then was it discovered that he had taken poison. Despite the hospital's best efforts to save him, it was too late, and he died at around 11 PM the night before.</p>
<h3>### Another Eleven Depositors Accuse Jiande Bank: Only Chai Chuangui Surrenders, Firmly Requests Extension for Reconciliation with Plaintiffs</h3>
<p>The collapse of Jiande Bank has now been almost three months, and there is still no resolution to the debts. The shareholders and general manager of the bank, including Chai Chuangui, have been repeatedly sued by creditors such as Wei Haijiang to the First Special District Court for fraud and embezzlement, and have been repeatedly summoned, as previously reported. It is now learned that eleven savings depositors of the bank, including Hu Qingxiang, Luo Hongji, Xu Bolun, Zhang Yiyuan, Tang Jinshu, Hu Xinpei, Zou Jiaquan, He Miaohong, Jiufeng Xinji, and Yong Taiyuan, have also jointly hired lawyers to file a lawsuit against the bank's directors and general manager for fraud and embezzlement. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Liu Yugui opened the court session. Unexpectedly, only Chai Chuangui surrendered among the defendants. The others, Chen Xifu, Chai Yousheng, Tu Kaizheng, Li Jingwei, Yan Ziyu, Yan Keming, Ma Suizhi, Ou Jiancheng, and Zheng Huairong, all avoided appearing in court. The accountant from the clearing house, Mr. Pan, submitted seven or eight related account books to the court as instructed. The plaintiff's lawyer then stated the intent of the lawsuit, stating that the bank's capital was claimed to be one million, and it was claimed that fifty thousand was collected when registered, but the actual amount was only slightly more than twenty thousand. Not long after opening, the bank widely advertised a six-week anniversary celebration, adding one percent interest to deposits during the anniversary period. When the business failed, the responsible directors not only failed to declare bankruptcy according to the company law, but also secretly repurchased the bank's shares as it was on the verge of collapse. For example, Liang Yaoting was originally a shareholder of the bank, and Liang's shares were repurchased at that time so that Liang could relieve himself of shareholder responsibility. All of these actions were fraudulent to depositors, embezzling deposits, and violating company regulations. The total amount of money defrauded from the plaintiffs in this case is more than three thousand yuan. Therefore, in addition to requesting that the defendants be punished according to law, they also requested that they be ordered to repay the principal and interest. When questioned, the defendant Chai Chuangui insisted on requesting an extension, saying that the authorities and the plaintiffs were reconciled. The plaintiff's lawyer immediately said that the defendant's request for an extension based on the possibility of reconciliation was purely a delaying tactic, and that the defendant was now doing his best to buy up the bank's savings passbooks, because he had seen through the weakness of the average depositor, knowing that they were not wealthy, and was taking the opportunity to buy back the passbooks with six percent cash, forcing the depositors to sacrifice. Judge Liu then said that many of the plaintiffs had also not arrived, so the session was adjourned for further questioning.</p>
<h3>### Midnight Show: Teenage Girl's Fatal Misstep, Cao Ding Complains Against Xia Jinrong</h3>
<p>Cao Ding, a Suzhou woman residing at 122 Avenue Edward VII in the French Concession, is 47 years old. Her husband was a well-known rascal, nicknamed "Lame Foot Agen," and has since passed away. She has a daughter named Qiaoyun, who is 16 years old. She is pretty. She entered Yangxing Primary School when she was 11 or 12 years old and studied there for three years. Recently, she dropped out of school and stayed at home, unmarried and waiting to be betrothed. Xia Jinrong, the son of Xia Laosan (who was from Hubei and is now deceased), the owner of the Yuquanchi Bathhouse at No. 4 Jixiang Street, is 27 years old. He owns hundreds of thousands of dollars in inheritance and likes to be frivolous and wandering, frequenting entertainment venues and engaging in affairs. On the evening of January 23rd (the 19th day of the twelfth lunar month), Xia and two friends, Wang and Sun, went to Cao's house. At that time, Qiaoyun's younger sister, Su Lili, was also present. Xia and the other two invited Cao Ding, her daughter Qiaoyun, and Su to go to the Tianchan Stage on Fourth Avenue to see a play. When the show ended at midnight, everyone left their seats and went out the door. The theater entrance was crowded with people. Xia followed Qiaoyun and Lili, and Xia Ding, Wang, and Sun were separated from them. Xia then used his seductive skills and invited Qiaoyun and Lili to have some snacks, luring them to room 504 on the fifth floor of the Oriental Hotel on Tibet Road. After eating snacks, Lili took a bath and returned home alone. Qiaoyun was forced to stay overnight by Xia and was forcibly raped that night. The next day, they got up and separated. When Qiaoyun returned home, her mother asked where she had stayed the night before. Qiaoyun concealed the truth from her mother, falsely claiming that she had stayed at Su Lili's house. Ding did not think much of it. It was not until the Lantern Festival that Ding discovered that Qiaoyun had been raped by Xia, and she was shocked. She negotiated with Xia, but Xia not only refused to admit it but also used abusive language. Ding was extremely resentful and could not bear it any longer. Therefore, in her capacity as legal guardian, she hired a lawyer with her daughter to file a lawsuit in the criminal court of the Special Third Court, accusing Xia Jinrong of violating Article 240, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law for raping a girl under the age of fifteen, endangering public morals, and Article 257 of the same law for abducting a minor, separating her from the person with parental rights, arbitrarily raping her, and endangering the family. At the same time, she collected evidence to prepare for the case. The court issued a summons based on the lawsuit and sent police officers to serve the parties, scheduling a hearing for the afternoon of the next day, presided over by Judge Li Changnian.</p>
<h3>### Shanghai Municipal Council Discusses the Registration of Rickshaw Pullers: The Vehicle Committee is Granted Special Authority to Deal with the Matter Easily</h3>

<h3>### Ruan Lingyu Case to be Heard Tomorrow: Yesterday, Some People Already Tried to Reserve Seats at the Courthouse, Court Officials Respond that Courthouse is Not a Theater</h3>
<p>Ruan Lingyu, a Cantonese actress and leading actress in a certain film company, whose childhood name is A Gen and who is 26 years old, met Zhang Damin, a wealthy son (currently at 650 North Sichuan Road) while walking in the Kunshan Garden in Hongkou when she was seven years old. Their love developed into cohabitation. The following year, Zhang's mother passed away in Guangdong. Zhang and Ruan returned to their hometown to attend the funeral. Ruan first observed filial piety in the position of a daughter-in-law, and after a hundred days, the two were hastily married in the mourning hall. Afterwards, they came to Shanghai together and formed a small family in Hongkou. Because Zhang worked as a comprador for the Ruian Shipping Company in Taikoo Company in Hong Kong, he served on the ships and feared that Ruan would feel lonely living alone in Shanghai, so he adopted a daughter, named Miaorong (that is, Xiaoyu), to accompany her. In the 20th year, they moved to Dasheng Hutong on Haig Road in the French Concession. Ruan, through the introduction of Zhang's brother, Zhang Huichong, became an actress at the Star Film Company, while Zhang continued to do business in Hong Kong. At this time, Ruan developed a love affair with Tang Xiushan, a wealthy businessman from the same hometown in Hong Kong. She rented another house at 21, Lane 147, Haig Road to live in. In the spring of the 22nd year, Zhang went to Beijing from Hong Kong on business and visited home on the way. He saw that Ruan was living with Tang and left in a fit of anger. The next day, Ruan appointed lawyer Wu Chengyu to make an agreement for Zhang to sign to end their relationship. Zhang requested that Ruan return the clothes, furniture, and other items she had purchased. Ruan agreed to return them, but at that time, Zhang was unable to stay in Shanghai and hurriedly went to Hong Kong to become the director of the Business Tax Bureau in Fujian Province. Until the Fujian Incident occurred some years ago, Zhang returned to Shanghai. In the winter of last year, he hired a lawyer to send a letter to Ruan Lingyu asking her to fulfill the previous conditions and return the clothes and other items. Recently, Ruan broke her promise, and Tang instead filed a lawsuit in the First Special Court against Zhang Damin for defamation. As a result, he was found not guilty. Recently, Zhang Damin hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit in the primary criminal court of the Second Special Court, accusing Ruan Lingyu of forgery, embezzlement, theft, and other crimes. He also sued Ruan Lingyu and Tang Xiushan in the local criminal court for abduction and adultery. The court, based on the lawsuit, issued a summons on the 27th of last month, by Judge Sun Penghian of the primary court, to both parties for a hearing. The defendant Ruan Lingyu claimed to be ill and did not attend. The court reviewed the case file and determined that the case was related to the case in the local court, and ruled to wait for the transfer to the local court for a joint hearing. It has been reported before. It is now learned that the local criminal court of the Second Special Court has issued a summons, sent police to notify both parties and inform both lawyers, and scheduled a hearing for the afternoon of the 9th (that is, tomorrow). The occurrence of this case, after being reported in the newspapers, has attracted the attention of fans and people from all walks of life in Shanghai. It is expected that the court will be crowded with spectators tomorrow. What is even stranger is that yesterday morning, someone went to the registration office of the Second Special Court to request to reserve seats, fearing that it would be crowded at the time and that they would not be able to enter the court to see the splendor of both parties. The clerk at the registration office replied that the court was a solemn place, not a theater where tickets could be reserved, and rejected the request. The person left disappointed. It is heard that the judicial police chief of the Second Special Court, because the hearing of this case will be crowded with spectators and disrupt the order of the court, will send French police officers to supervise the court police to maintain order and check admission tickets. Those without tickets will be denied entry to the court.</p>
<h3>### Female Swindler Qiao Xu Conned for Goods Worth One or Two Yuan, Apprenticed Qian Xinchu Pursued and Caught Her, Li Shufang Proves She Is Guilty</h3>
<p>Recently, there has been a female swindler in Nanshi who specializes in swindling items from small shops, and the items swindled are worth at most one or two yuan. Many people have been victimized. Yesterday at 11:50 AM, she bought a foot basin and a pot lid at the Yuan Tong shop at No. 157 Fangxie Road, promising to pay one yuan and saying that she would go back to get the money and send it over. Then she took the items and left. Qian Xinchu (14 years old), an apprentice at the shop, immediately followed her. The female swindler saw that she was being followed and jumped into a rickshaw and sped away. Qian could not catch up, so he called the police to intercept her. When passing Fangbanqiao, Li Shufang (16 years old), who set up a shoe stall, caught a glimpse of her. The female swindler was the person who had swindled shoes from him a few days ago and never returned. So he immediately joined the Lao Beimen police station and asked for an investigation. After questioning, Chief Shen learned that the defendant's name was Qiao Xu, 42 years old, from Yangzhou, and lived in the house of Tang Laowu on Jiale Road. She denied swindling the items and only admitted that she had gone back to get the money. After Li Shufang proved that she was lying, the woman was speechless. The case involved accusations of fraud and was handed over to the Bureau for investigation.</p>

<h3>Stolen Car from French Concession Found in Nanshi Yesterday Morning; Only French Concession License Plate 8669 Found; Investigation Underway to Determine if Illegal Activities Occurred</h3>
<p>A report from the Guomin News Agency states that yesterday morning at approximately 3:00 AM, a dark blue Austin automobile with a French Concession "8669" black license plate was discovered at the end of Penglai Road, Nanyang Street, in Nanshi. It did not have a Chinese area license plate. Huang Jingyao, the officer from Post No. 6 of the Xundao Street Police Station of the Nanshi Public Security Bureau, investigated and found the car parked by the roadside with neither owner nor driver present. Moreover, the front right fender was damaged, and the rear left tire was punctured, although the body of the car was undamaged. He immediately reported this to the head of the station, Jin Dianyang, fearing that the car had been stolen by bandits for illegal activities. Consequently, he dispatched officers to take the car to the station for temporary storage and investigation, and reported the matter to headquarters for record. It is now known that the car was reported stolen to the French Concession police by the owner. The Public Concession General Police Department was notified on the night before yesterday at approximately 9:00 PM to be on the lookout. It was discovered yesterday morning in the Chinese area.

<h3>Liu Xiangsun, Former Shanghai Daotai, Sued by His Nephew's Widow; Unable to Endure Oppression After Her Husband's Death, She Took Her Son and Left; Uncle Says Household Affairs are in His Brother's Hands and He Can't Help; Zhou Heying Files Criminal Complaint for Abandonment</h3>
<p>Liu Xiangsun, from Hangzhou, who served as the Shanghai Daotai in the late Qing Dynasty, is now elderly and has been a resident of Shanghai since the Republic. He currently resides at No. 1 Gordon Road in Western Shanghai. Liu has four brothers, and he is the eldest. His second brother, named Zhongchang, also has four sons. The eldest, Zengbao, married a woman from Ningbo named Zhou Heying in the 11th year of the Republic (1922). Unexpectedly, Zengbao died suddenly the following year. Fortunately, Zhou gave birth to a son, continuing the family line. From then on, she remained chaste and raised her son with great hardship. She did not change her mind despite being a young widow. However, the Liu family in their ancestral home was a large, undivided household. After her husband's death, Zhou was frequently oppressed by the head of the family. At first, she endured it, but later found it impossible to live together. In the 14th year of the Republic (1925), she took her orphaned son from Hangzhou to Ningbo. As she had no parents or brothers, she temporarily stayed at her sister's home and obtained a teaching position at Zhongshan School in Ningbo, using her salary to make a living. She also tutored her son. However, the tuition fees were never enough to support their livelihood, so she repeatedly wrote to her father-in-law, Liu Zhongchang, asking for assistance. Zhongchang always excused himself by saying that household affairs were handled by Xiangsun, and he could not help. Zhou had no choice but to turn to her uncle-in-law, but each year she received only 40 gold yuan. Fortunately, her sister was very affectionate and lent her money whenever she was short, preventing her from freezing or starving. This year, she began teaching at the Xindan Elementary School on Yuezhou Road in this city, so she and her son moved to Shanghai. Her son, A'ming (also known as Zhonghe), is now twelve years old and is also studying at Xindan. However, having lived in Ningbo for many years, she has accumulated debts of over 4,000 gold yuan to her sister. Her sister, Wu Zhou, unwilling to sacrifice such a large sum, recently filed a lawsuit in the First Special District Court. After summoning both parties and questioning them, the judge kindly advised them to resolve the case peacefully, as they were sisters. He ordered Zhou Heying to repay in installments. Afterwards, Zhou, considering her current situation precarious, had no spare capacity to repay the debt. She thought about the family property her late husband should have inherited. As the Liu family had not divided their assets for several generations, and now they were all controlled by Liu Xiangsun, the living expenses for her and her son should naturally be provided by Xiangsun. She could not allow this abandonment to continue. Therefore, she hired a lawyer to file a criminal self-accusation against her uncle-in-law, Liu Xiangsun, in the name of her son A'ming's legal representative, for abandonment. She also attached a civil suit requesting a monthly living allowance of 50 yuan and 5,000 yuan for A'ming's education expenses. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Jiang Shuzi of the First Special District Court summoned the defendant, but he claimed to be ill and did not appear. He also hired a lawyer to defend him. After Zhou Heying stated the facts of the lawsuit, the witness Liu Pingzong, Zhou's nephew, testified. He said that he is currently a professor at Jiaotong University, the defendant is his uncle, Zhongdang is his father, the plaintiff is his sister-in-law, and A'ming is his nephew. After his brother Zengbao died, his sister-in-law insisted on moving out, and they could not stop her. Later, they repeatedly urged her to return, but she refused. The family property has not yet been divided among his brothers. Now, his parents still hope his sister-in-law will return, as they miss their grandson very much and have not seen him for ten years. The court then adjourned for another hearing.</p>
<h3>Yixing Compatriots Organize Yixing Disaster Relief Efforts</h3>
<p>Last year, Yixing suffered a severe drought, second only to Linyang in severity. The total number of affected people was 120,000, and deaths from starvation were reported daily. Pan Xulun, Sha Wuceng, Zong Boxuan, Zhou Boying, Zhu Rongzhuang, and other executive and supervisory committee members of the Yixing Association in Shanghai felt it was their inescapable duty to provide disaster relief to their hometown. Therefore, last autumn, they organized the Yixing Drought Relief Shanghai Branch under the Yixing Association in Shanghai, uniting with compatriots in Beijing, Hubei, and Tianjin to jointly raise relief funds. They also appealed to various charitable organizations in this city, such as the Provincial Drought Relief Association, the Red Swastika Society, the Sino-Foreign Relief Association, and the Jisheng Association, for assistance. These organizations generously donated funds to organize winter relief. The Red Swastika Society allocated 10,000 yuan, the Sino-Foreign Relief Association allocated 5,000 yuan, the Provincial Drought Relief Association allocated 3,000 yuan, the Yixing Drought Relief Association headquarters raised 10,000 yuan, and the Shanghai Branch raised 5,000 yuan, totaling 33,000 yuan, which was used to purchase flour and distribute it to provide emergency relief. Now that the winter relief has ended, the 120,000 victims are still crying out for food, and they lack seeds for summer planting. If spring relief is not continued, they will be left to die. It is now known that Pan Xulun, the chairman of the Yixing Association in Shanghai, has repeatedly pleaded with the Sino-Foreign Relief Association and the Jisheng Association, requesting them to send personnel to Yixing to distribute spring relief on their behalf. These associations have agreed to undertake this, but the relief funds must be at least 50,000 yuan, and Yixing compatriots must provide half of the funds. Mr. Pan consulted with these associations and the Yixing Drought Relief Association, and it has been agreed that the Jisheng Association, the Sino-Foreign Relief Association, the Yixing Drought Relief Committee, the Headquarters, and the Shanghai Branch will each donate 12,500 yuan, totaling 50,000 yuan, which will be handed over to the Jisheng Association to send personnel to Yixing to distribute. Recently, Pan Xulun has handed over the 12,500 yuan raised by Yixing compatriots living abroad to the Sino-Foreign Relief Association (including more than 6,600 yuan donated and raised by Mr. Pan himself, 800 yuan raised by Zhu Rongzhuang through calligraphy and painting, 1,000 yuan from compatriots in Beijing, more than 2,700 yuan from Jia Guobo and other compatriots in Hubei, 600 yuan from Ren Zhencai and other compatriots in Tianjin, and the remaining 900 yuan from the Yixing Shanghai winter relief donations.) The Yixing Drought Relief Association Headquarters has also remitted 6,000 yuan to the Jisheng Association in advance.</p>
<h3>National Goods Showcase Competition; Today Commemorates Women's Day</h3>
<p>Since participating in the Sino-American sponsored national goods showcase competition, the Oriental Chemical Industry Company has launched a great sacrifice by offering one yuan (various Sino-American cigarettes) for one yuan (various Oriental cosmetics), causing a sensation in Shanghai. The Sino-American retail department at 509 Nanjing Road is unusually crowded with male and female customers. The originally scheduled gifts of 1,000 yuan were to be distributed in the morning and afternoon, but as soon as the iron doors opened, the gifts were gone in less than half an hour, and the iron doors had to be closed again. Female customers were often pushed out and found it difficult to participate universally. The company felt apologetic about this. Today, on the occasion of Women's Day, they are holding a celebration to specially entertain women, to thank them for their enthusiasm for using national goods. From tomorrow onwards, regardless of gender, gifts will be given out as usual. The ten-day gift period will therefore be extended by one day to the 11th.</p>
<h3>Follow-up on the Zhabei Robbery Case; Suspects Claim They Were Not Robbers; All Six Handed Over to Separate Sections</h3>
<p>The Zhabei Xinza Police Station's Tanziwan Police Outpost escorted two suspects in a theft case, Wu Kaijue and Sun Jinhong, at 3:10 PM the day before yesterday. They were robbed by Wu San and others at the railway crossing. Wu San, Bao Genpei, Li Xiaofuzi, and Ling Yangsheng, the alleged robbers, were apprehended at the time, and along with the plaintiff Jiang Zongtang and three others, were sent to the Xinza Police Station. While they were being interrogated, Wu Er handed over his younger brother Wu Kaijue and others, and Wu Kaijue and Sun Jinhong suddenly surrendered themselves. These events were reported in yesterday's newspaper. Now it is known that the plaintiff stated that after the theft that night, he immediately reported it to the Tanziwan Police Station, which dispatched police to arrest Wu Kaijue and Sun Jinhong. Unexpectedly, while being escorted to the station, Wu San and others robbed Wu Kaijue and Sun Jinhong at the railway crossing. Fortunately, I reported it to the Tanziwan Police Station by phone, which dispatched a large number of police officers to arrest Wu San and the other four. However, no evidence was found at the time, so Wu San and others turned on me, saying they wanted me to "pull the table" (a slang term for gangsters, meaning to treat them to several tables of wine). Wu San stated that he initially did not intend to rob Wu Kaijue and others, but was trying to plead with the police officer, Lu Wenxing. Unexpectedly, the police officer did not recognize him, which led to a scuffle. Wu Kaijue and Sun Jinhong both stated that when they were being escorted to the station, they saw them fighting, so they took the opportunity to escape. They did not intend to do so. Later, realizing that things were not going well, they surrendered themselves. Bao Genpei and Li Xiaofuzi admitted to being friends with Wu San, but denied helping to rob Wu Kaijue and Sun Jinhong. Ling Yangsheng insisted that he did not know Wu San and the others, and had been mistakenly arrested. After reviewing the statements, interrogator Zheng Zuhan determined that the case involved robbery and fell within the scope of criminal law, which this branch station was not authorized to handle. Therefore, he ordered that the plaintiff Jiang Zongtang, the defendants Wu San, Wu Kaijue, Sun Jinhong, Bao Genpei, Li Xiaofuzi, and Ling Yangsheng, all six of them, be handed over to the third section of the Public Security Bureau's Zhabei branch yesterday afternoon at approximately 5:00 PM for further action.</p>

<h3>Film</h3>
<p>First-Class Animal Film to be Shown in Paris: Animal films have been popular in recent years. Since the birth of *Tarzan the Ape Man*, the appeal of animal films has grown even stronger. The American Ediel Film Company has also recently produced an animal film entitled *Crawling Death*. The content is interspersed and has a unique flavor. It was filmed in the wilderness of the lower reaches of the Mexican Levalente Grande, so it is very different from animal films that use scenery. The fights between wild animals were filmed with a telescope, and the scenes are completely real, making people shudder when they see them. The whole film has many tense moments. In the scene where a tiger eats a monkey, after the tiger pounces on a lion, the monkeys cry sadly. A shepherd hears this and lets his water buffalo fight the tiger. The tiger is injured and a bear comes to eat it. The monkeys are overjoyed and dance around the buffalo to show their gratitude. The key point of the plot is that a couple separates due to disagreements. The wife takes her young son to the Grande. The young son spends his days with the natives and wild animals. When he grows up, he becomes extremely brave and falls in love with a native girl. Later, his father finds him and the family is reunited. The young son is the little Tarzan, played by young star Maurice Murphy. It is reported that this film will be shown at the Paris Grand Theater on Avenue Joffre, starting this Sunday.</p>

Today, the final two games between the second and first-ranked players from China and Britain will be held at the Victoria General Association at 5:30 PM and 9:00 PM respectively. Zhang Yingda of China was originally scheduled to play against Bowder of Britain, but he has been replaced by Shekharm. The first-ranked Li Gongying will play against Glean in the last game. There is no doubt that Li Gongying and Zhang Yingda, the main players of the Chinese team, will win. How much they win will be the key to this year's Sino-British championship.</p>
<p>Ding Mingyi Lost by One Shot</p>
<p>In yesterday's first game, Ding Mingyi of China played against Bolger of Britain. The situation was fairly even. Bolger continued to make two shots of 30 and 72, leading Ding by 100 points. Ding did not lose heart and focused on improving, gradually reducing the difference. Fortunately, the god of luck arrived, and he scored 46 and then 48, making the score 347. Since then, although he often fell behind, the number was very small. After 500 points, Ding suddenly made an incredible shot, causing the audience and Li Baying, the billiards king of Shanghai, to applaud and stick out their tongues. He accumulated 73 points in one hand, for a total of 575 points. At that time, he had surpassed his opponent by more than 30 points. The goal was in front of him, and it was not difficult to win. Suddenly, one shot missed the target, and Bolger scored 16 more points to finish. As a result, Bolger scored 600 points and Ding Mingyi scored 584 points. The high points are as follows: (Bolger) 30, 72, 35, 24, 20, 21, 30; (Ding Mingyi) 21, 21, 28, 46, 48, 28, 33, 24, 23, 28, 73.</p>
<p>Maxwell Wins with Steadiness</p>
<p>In the third game, Xu Shizhang and Maxwell of Britain were indeed strong opponents. Maxwell's final victory relied on his experience and steadiness. He was not reckless or negligent. His high points were only up to 40, but there were 11 scores over 20. Xu's skills were also superb, but his weakness was that he was too eager to try, often sacrificing a little point and giving the other party a good opportunity to advance. They approached each other several times, but it was difficult to maintain a difference within 100 points. Fortunately, in the last two shots, he scored 32 and 29 in a row. As a result, Xu scored 550 points and Maxwell scored 600 points. China lost another 50 points. The high points for the two are as follows: (Maxwell) 32, 23, 22, 123, 11, 40, 34, 34, 36, 31, 21; (Xu Shizhang) 20, Hole 5, 22, 22, 66, 32, 29.</p>

<h3>Liangjiang Basketball Team's Southern Expedition (2): A 67-2 Victory Over the All-Star Team</h3>
<p>(Manila Correspondence) The Liangjiang Women's Physical Education School basketball team showed its edge as soon as it arrived in the Philippines, defeating the All Nations Central School, a strong female team that dominates the Philippines, with a score of 49 to 13. The fierceness of their combat power and the excellence of their ball skills have left a deep impression on local Chinese and foreign people. On the afternoon of the 17th of last month at 4:30 PM, they went out for the second time and played against the All-Star team at the Saint Thomas basketball hall. Liangjiang showed great power and won a big victory over the All-Star team with a score of 67 to 2. The large difference in score has set a record that has never been seen in the Philippine women's basketball community. The following is a brief record of the battle:</p>
<p>Ms. Pan</p>
<p>Petite and Exquisite</p>
<p>It happened to be Sunday that day, so more than 2,000 people came to watch the game. The Shanghai team wore white shirts and green pants, and the Philippine team wore white shirts and black pants. At 4:30 PM, the two teams followed the referee Bao Dishi, and the whistle sounded. Liangjiang was very active from beginning to end, and the guards and forwards were brave and unparalleled. Before long, Chen Rongming received a ball from the back, stepped up a few steps, and scored the first goal. Not long after, Ms. Pan Meng and Ms. Chen Jucai successively scored points, and Ms. Pan was petite and exquisite, conquering east and west, and her footprints covered the entire field. The beauty of her shooting posture was praised by the audience. In the first quarter, Liangjiang took the lead with a score of 10 to 0.</p>
<p>Chen Rongming</p>
<p>Contributed Despite the Pain</p>
<p>The All-Star team, having suffered in the first quarter at the hands of Liangjiang, was eager to retaliate and used two people to monitor Dong Rongming and Chen Jucai. Not long after the second half began, Dong Rongming was injured in the head by the opponent's guard. Chen held his head and stopped the game. After a while, he continued the game despite the pain. Seeing him so brave, everyone applauded him. Liangjiang had Hu Zuo and Pan Meng enter the game. Before long, they scored points one after another. The two teams competed back and forth. The obese left forward of the All-Star team, Ms. Kiro, took the opportunity to foul Chen Baixue and got a free throw opportunity, making one of two attempts. The situation broke with a score of one to twenty, breaking the dull situation. At the end of the first half, Liangjiang was leading 24 to 1.</p>
<p>Philippine Miss</p>
<p>Indignant and Filled with Anger</p>
<p>After quenching their thirst, the two sides changed bases and fought again. Pan Meng showed her great skill in dodging, turning, and passing the ball, often working with Chen Rongming to attack. The score board high hung twenty-nine to one, and Liangjiang was still aggressive. The All-Stars could not resist. Chen Jucai and Pan Meng scored four more goals, making the score thirty-seven to one. At this time, Philippine Miss Annie took a risk and charged towards Liangjiang, attacking twice, but she was repelled by Chen Baixue and Bao Shuxia, and Liangjiang's defense was secure.</p>
<p>Hu Zuoqiong</p>
<p>Enters the Game Again</p>
<p>At the start of the fourth quarter, Hu Zuoqiong of Liangjiang entered the game to replace Pan Meng. The three wingers shot from left and right, and they were all successful. The score increased to sixty-three to one. Chen Rongming was injured in the head again by the opponent, but he continued to fight despite the pain. Later, the opponent scored one point from a free throw, making the score one to sixty-three. With one minute left in the game, Chen Rongming continued to be powerful, scoring two goals in a row. At the end of the game, Liangjiang played a triumphant song for the second time, winning 67 to 2.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Education Supervises Middle Schools in Studying Education and Issues Outline for Research Associations</h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 7th) The Ministry of Education has instructed all departments that in recent years, the ministry has successively formulated and promulgated standards for curricula and equipment in primary and secondary schools and normal schools, graduation examinations for students in middle and normal schools, and regulations for the certification of teachers in primary and secondary schools, in order to comprehensively improve and enhance educational efficiency. However, our country has a vast territory, and the circumstances of schools in various regions, due to historical legacy and geographical environment, are extremely different. The way to improve is to follow the central government's decrees on the one hand and to consider the actual situation in various localities and study implementation on the other, so as to promote benefits to the fullest extent and avoid the drawbacks of rigidity. Moreover, there are countless aspects of educational methods, and there are countless problems that need to be studied on the ground. Without research organizations, it is not easy to carry out reforms and obtain appropriate results. In order to supervise local schools in studying education issues, the ministry has specially formulated the "Outline of Measures for Provincial and Municipal Academic Teacher Training Education Research Associations" and the "Outline of Measures for Research on Guidance for Elementary Education", along with examples of research questions to be addressed, and issued them with an order. The ministry directs immediate establishment of research associations in accordance with the respective outlines to conduct research and to report the results of the research on the questions raised to the ministry for review by the end of May.</p>

<h3>Madame Weydenthal, Wife of the Polish Envoy, Delivers a Celebrated Lecture at Jinling Women's University</h3>
<p>At the invitation of the China-Poland Cultural Association and Jinling Women's Arts and Sciences College, Madame Weydenthal, wife of the Polish Envoy to China, accompanied Envoy Weydenthal to Nanjing on the 5th evening and gave a public lecture at Jinling Women's College. The topic was "The Contribution of Polish Women to the History and Culture of Their Country." Dr. Wu Yifang, President of Jinling Women's College, specially invited the Envoy and his wife to a tea party at the college at 4:00 p.m. on the 6th, accompanied by Ao Jingshi and Xie Shoukang, directors of the China-Poland Cultural Association, and others. Afterwards, she led Envoy Weydenthal and others on a tour of the college. Madame Weydenthal praised the college repeatedly. Foreign and Chinese people who came to listen to the lecture had already arrived successively. Among the foreign guests were Mr. and Mrs. Haas, Mr. and Mrs. Lee Hofer, Mr. and Mrs. Trier, Mr. Dantek, representatives of the League of Nations, members of various embassies and consulates, consultants and engineers from various countries, academic figures from various institutions in Nanjing, and students from various schools, totaling more than 500 people. Madame Weydenthal entered the auditorium, and President Wu delivered a speech, stating, "Madame Casimire Barthel de Weydenthal, the wife of Envoy Weydenthal, has been in China for a long time and has close ties with people in the academic community of our country. Madame Weydenthal is a scholar who has studied literature at the world-renowned Krakow University in Poland. Today, she has agreed to come to our college to lecture on the contribution of Polish women to the history and culture of their country, which will surely enable us to have a more precise understanding of Polish women, thereby promoting the rapprochement and understanding between our two nations. I am extremely happy and grateful," etc. Amidst applause, Madame Weydenthal stood up and lectured, giving a concise and clear account of important figures and general conditions of various eras of Polish women from the beginning of Polish history to the present. Her description of their participation in revolutionary work and their contribution to the revival of the Polish nation was particularly moving. The lecture ended at 6:40 p.m. In the evening at 8:00 p.m., Chu Minyi, Xie Shoukang, Chen Jianxiao, Guo Youshou, Ao Jingshi, directors of the China-Poland Association, hosted a banquet at the Association of Students Returning from Germany, Austria, and Switzerland.

<h3>Huang Yingbai and Li Jigu Support the Principles of the Ten Articles Declaration, Advocate Maintaining the Inherent Virtues of the Chinese Nation, Hope for Mutual Love Among Compatriots to Seek Self-Reliance, and Praise Famous Officials and Brave Generals as Models for People Today</h3>
<p>Huang Yingbai's Opinion Huang Yingbai expressed his enthusiastic support for the Ten Articles Declaration with a very sincere attitude. Mr. Huang first stated that "The survival of a nation must have its conditions for survival. The most important principles we should promote today are self-reliance and harmonious coexistence among compatriots. To achieve self-reliance, we must first strive for the unity of the nation. To realize the unity of the nation, compatriots must first have the spirit of mutual love. This spirit is what the ancients called 'coming and going as friends, watching and helping each other, and supporting each other in sickness,' which is also the inherent virtue of our nation. If we do not preserve and promote it today, how can we talk about sincerely uniting to revitalize the nation? Mutual love among compatriots is an innate instinct. Since you all want to build a culture rooted in China, I hope you can inspire this spirit of mutual love among compatriots." He continued, "The Ten Articles Declaration will have a great impact on awakening the consciousness of young people. Currently, a portion of our country's youth often forgets their roots and clamors for world revolution, shouting long live for foreign countries. After this upheaval, they will surely realize that forgetting their roots is wrong." Finally, he solemnly stated, "Building a culture rooted in China is the responsibility of all Chinese people. Examining various countries in the world, whenever they are weak, there is always a 'nation-building' movement of this kind. I sincerely hope that this movement to build a culture rooted in China can be as powerful as the nation-building movements of other countries."</p>
<p>Li Jigu's Opinion Mr. Li Jigu, professor at Peking University and director of the Department of Literature and History at the Women's Arts and Sciences College, recently happened to be in Beijing. When discussing the Ten Articles Declaration, he said that he fully supports its principles, but the declaration has not yet mentioned specific plans. This aspect still needs to be considered and discussed by everyone. If a specific plan can be formulated so that all parties have something to follow, then the results may be even greater. He also said that in terms of material aspects, China is not truly poor. China simply cannot utilize all its wealth. If the Chinese people can develop their industries in a planned and down-to-earth manner, it may be possible to move from poverty to prosperity. Poverty is an inevitable disease. In terms of spiritual aspects, although China has always emphasized an ethical view of life, after the Song Dynasty, due to hypocrisy, many things were out of touch with human feelings, making it difficult for the people to know what to do or follow. In the last hundred years, due to the influence of Western civilization, the old morality has been discarded even more, and the morality of the new era has not yet been established or formed, causing the people to be even more bewildered. Intellectuals should pay close attention to this situation. He also said that from the standpoint of revitalizing the nation, the Ministry of Education should issue a unified order to promote famous officials and brave generals with integrity, such as Yue Wumu, Wen Tianxiang, and Fang Xiaoru, so that high officials and military generals have models to follow.</p>

<h3>Elementary School Students are Enthusiastic Patriots</h3>

The elementary school students understood the heavenly duty of saving the country through aviation and asked their parents to do their best to donate. At 8:00 a.m. yesterday (the 7th), when the school students gathered at the accounting office to pay their aviation donation, three female students cried incessantly. Principal Jin Yamin asked them the reason. They said, "We usually save money for cakes, and we are willing to donate it for aviation, but our parents detained it today, and we are really unwilling." Principal Jin comforted them in many ways, but the sound of crying did not stop. This shows that the patriotism of elementary school students is truly unwilling to lag behind.</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Tidbits</h3>
<p>— (Fan Shushen)</p>
<p>Zhang the fortune teller said: "Next year, good fortune will shine brightly, and wealth and joy will come to your door." Li the fortune teller said: "A great disaster will surely occur within three days; going northwest will bring great luck." However, according to my thinking, if good fortune can be brought about and disaster can be avoided, then everyone born in the world must be blessed.</p>
<p>Some people say: If we use birds and beasts to compare human beings, then some are like majestic lions, some are like brave tigers and leopards, some are like cunning foxes, some are as poisonous as snakes and scorpions, some are as beautiful as peacocks, some are aware of current affairs like geese and swallows,... Some people say: If we use plants to compare human beings, then some people are like cold-resistant plums and bamboos, some are like evergreen pines and cypresses, some are like vines attached to other trees, some are like thorny roses,... However, various plants or animals can grow in the world, at least with some usefulness; however, what kind of animal or plant can those who only eat and do nothing be compared to!</p>
<h3>Random Talk Among Couples, Old and Young</h3>
<p>— Yi Sheng</p>
<p>The coordination of a couple is such that if their ages are similar, both will obtain "evenly matched" harmony in their physiology and daily life. However, driven by the power of love or other special relationships, it is also reasonable to expect that the age gap between the two sexes may be very different to form a match. In the past, there were many famous events in history that could serve as precedents, such as Duke Wen of Jin marrying Qi Jiang and Liu Xianzu marrying into the Eastern Wu. Among the common people, such things are even more like everyday meals, not worth being surprised at. Just like the marriage of a certain famous lawyer and a certain celebrity a few years ago, where the wife was older than the husband, it was said to be largely due to a mutual understanding; at that time, no one was discussing anything. This year, Xiong Xiling and Mao Yanwen's marriage, which matches an old man with a young wife, also belongs to people with status in society, but the matter came about by chance and has received great attention and criticism from society!</p>
<p>Recently, there was also an old Indian man, sixty years old, ten thousand miles away, who was about to marry a thirteen-year-old girl in a few days. That Indian saint, Gandhi, was greatly opposed to it and prepared to teach his followers to resist it. Three years ago, a similar event occurred, and Gandhi taught his disciples to form a funeral procession and accompany it along the road; this action has a bit of humorous meaning! If that marrying old man acted on his own initiative and preemptively, prepared a coffin to accompany him, and indicated that he wanted to fight to the death against his or her old age prospects, I'm afraid Gandhi would have no choice!</p>
<p>Gandhi is willing to incur resentment in order to safeguard humanitarianism: but he is too good at playing pranks and can be considered a saint of the times. From this point of view, it is better to be an old man, or an old Chinese man, to enjoy the advantage of being a new groom; to occupy the word "widower" among the four helpless poor people: widowers, widows, orphans, and the childless, in the past one was pitied by the royal government -- just according to Xiong's post-marital confession -- now no one will actually carry out sabotage.</p>
<h3>Anecdotes About Cigarette Packets</h3>
<p>— Zheng Yimei</p>
<p>Cigarettes have been in our country for decades. My friend Qian Huafo does not smoke, but he likes to collect cigarette cases and packets, collecting everything, which is a grand sight. He glues them into albums, a number of volumes, and he is ingenious in his organization. For example, he combines the World brand with the Peace brand to form World Peace, and the Central brand with the Committee brand to form Central Committee. He also combines the Sun Yat-sen, Zijin Mountain, Longevity Mountain, Ma Zhanshan, and Wanbaoshan five brands into the Five Mountains Chart. He also demonstrates clever thinking. Also, the White Phoenix brand box shows a chicken, and the Dog brand shows a dog's head. When asked, he says: "This is a chicken crowing and a dog stealing." On another page, he glues a certain cigarette box from Japan, below which are the Bandit brand and the Great Wall brand, saying: "This also has a slight meaning, but the meaning is quite obvious and not difficult to guess." The most auspicious combination is to combine the Golden Brand, Ruyi Brand, Long Happiness Brand, and Great Harvest Brand into one page. Seeing it makes people happy. This is truly a good song and prayer. Others, such as the Pinhai brand, are marked as produced in the 25th year of Guangxu, with a price of sixteen texts per box; the Bicycle brand, produced in the 32nd year of Guangxu, with a price of eighteen texts per box; the Rickshaw brand, produced in the third year of Xuantong, is marked as the rickshaw brand commonly known, with five sticks per pack, sold for five texts. Seeing this is enough to see the huge difference in prices between today and the past. Also, the Phoenix Call brand, with a colorful phoenix painted on the box, is said to be produced by Hongwu Tobacco Company in the second year of the Republic of China, founded by Bai Liewu. It has now disappeared from the market. Huafo further pointed to the White Gold Dragon brand and said: "This is the cigarette that Zhang Taiyan liked to smoke." Old Knife brand said: "This is the cigarette that Tianxu Wosheng liked to smoke." Beauty brand said: "This is what Zheng Mantuo and Li Jinhui both loved to smoke." Others, such as the relationship between art performers and the Pyramids, and the relationship between laborers and the Golden Mouse brand, all seem to have a close and inextricable connection. Therefore, the taste of smoking can reveal the person's position and character. Huafo is a thoughtful person with insightful observations. I am writing this anecdote to record it.</p>
<h3>Petty Theft</h3>
<p>— Zhu Ying</p>
<p>This time, Mr. Zhang's family in our alley caught a petty thief. This petty thief, around 5:30 in the afternoon, when dusk was approaching, slipped into Mr. Zhang's half-open front door and stole a summer wool jacket and a lined overcoat. He was just about to sneak away when Mr. Zhang caught him and grabbed him.</p>
<p>The cry of "Mr. Zhang's family caught a petty thief" immediately spread throughout the alley. The noise was so loud, everyone rushed to Mr. Zhang's door to see the excitement. Driven by curiosity, I also squeezed in to see what was going on. When I got to Mr. Zhang's door, I saw the petty thief kneeling in front of Mr. Zhang, kowtowing repeatedly.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang saw me, nodded and greeted me, so I squeezed forward and glanced at the petty thief kneeling on the ground, and couldn't help but be startled, because the petty thief was actually Yu Guisheng, who had been my next-door neighbor three years ago. So I couldn't help but blurt out, "Yu Guisheng, how did you get into this kind of thing?" The petty thief paused when he heard me call his name, then recognized me and said with tears streaming down his face, "Sir, alas, ever since the factory closed down, for the past four years, I haven't been able to find work. My old mother, wife, and children have all been starving for three or four years. We've eaten everything and pawned everything we have, and I couldn't think of any other way, so I started doing this. I've done it three times, and never been caught. Today I was caught. I beg you, sir, please be lenient. If I'm sent to the authorities, my whole family will starve to death." I felt somewhat sympathetic after hearing this. Mr. Zhang saw that I knew him, so he didn't want to send him to the police. Yu Guisheng quickly crawled on the ground and kowtowed to me and Mr. Zhang. Then, a thin, gaunt figure disappeared into the dark entrance of the alley.</p>
<p>When I got home, I felt my eyes were a little wet.</p>
<h3>Shared Suffering</h3>
<h3>Records of Lingering Fragrance</h3>
<p>— Originally written by Princess Der Ling of Qing, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Peeking down from the gap in the sedan curtain, I could only see the yellow sand on the ground quickly receding behind us, which showed how fast our sedan was traveling. It made me recall how high our spirits were when we left the palace and went to the train station on this same sandy road just over ten days ago? It felt like only yesterday! Before long, we had entered the Imperial City, and the city gates were wide open on both sides, welcoming us in without any hesitation.</p>
<p>However, this was not the final destination of our journey! The Empress Dowager would definitely not stay here. Although this was indeed the center of the Imperial City, the depths of the inner court, the so-called central hub; the Empress Dowager had never liked this place!</p>
<p>"How old and dilapidated this place is!" She once clearly expressed her dissatisfaction with this palace. She said, "Besides the many tall and inappropriate buildings, it's simply empty and devoid of anything! As soon as we make the slightest sound, it will evoke a huge echo; making us feel terrified. Even that Imperial Garden has no decorations; it's full of tall, gloomy old trees, with no bright flowers or gentle breeze. This place is simply filled with a cold, lifeless atmosphere, without the slightest hint of vitality!"</p>
<p>Because of this reason, she spent more than seven-tenths of her later life in the Summer Palace. However, today we have just returned from Fengtian, and logically speaking, we must first come to the palace: if there were no such customary restrictions, she would have gone directly to the Summer Palace after leaving the train station.

<h3>Home Cooking</h3>
<p>— Zhu Yun</p>
<p>Preserving Vegetables: In spring, when the apricot trees are in bloom, the rapeseed flowers in the fields are a vibrant yellow, very eye-catching. This type of rapeseed, when it is just sprouting and hasn't yet flowered, is called "vegetable heart"; it is a common spring vegetable, and is very delicious when boiled as a vegetarian dish. When this "vegetable heart" is tender, wash it clean, then boil it in a pot with water, take it out and dry it on bamboo poles or ropes in the sun. This dried "vegetable heart" is called "dried vegetable head," and it can be stored for a long time without spoiling in a dry earthenware jar or pot. When cooking this "dried vegetable head," it must first be soaked in boiling water until it is plump, and then you can start cooking. Spinach and horsehair also can be boiled, dried, and stored for later use, and they have a cool, unique flavor when eaten.</p>
<p>Bamboo Shoots and Sweet Bamboo Shoots: In the spring, bamboo shoots are certainly the only famous vegetable. The taste of bamboo shoots is fresh and delicious, and whether boiled or used in vegetarian dishes, they are always fresh, refreshing, and flavorful. However, bamboo shoots are seasonal, and while they are tender in February and March, as spring fades, the bamboo shoots also sprout leaves and become new bamboo, at which point they become old and inedible. Therefore, in addition to canned goods, Suzhou families also have several ways to preserve bamboo shoots. There are usually two common methods. First, cut the bamboo shoots into thin strips, and boil them with soy sauce, etc., then take them out and dry them in the sun. Another method is to also cut the bamboo shoots into thin strips, and boil them with soy sauce and sugar together, then dry them slightly in the sun and store them for later use. These sweet bamboo shoots are all made from tender bamboo shoots and are exceptionally delicious.</p>
<p>Cured Meat and Dried Fish: Fresh fish, meat, and vegetables are certainly fresh, delicious, and fatty, but pickled and cured foods also have a unique flavor. At the end of the year and the beginning of the new year, after washing the fresh fish or meat, first marinate it with salt, then soak it in soy sauce for one or two weeks to allow the salty taste of the soy sauce to penetrate into the fish or meat, then take it out and dry it in the sun, and hang it under the eaves in a ventilated place, where it can be stored for a long time without spoiling. Because this fish or meat has been soaked in soy sauce, the fat is not greasy, and the lean meat is even more bright red, almost like ham. Cured meat is most popular when spring bamboo shoots come on the market, and cooking it with fresh meat is the most seasonal home-style dish during the Qingming Festival. Dried fish, stewed with wine, is so refreshing and delicious that it is truly not inferior to southern ham!</p>
<p>Pea Shoots, Lettuce, and Water Shield: Pea shoots are the vines of peas. Suzhou people call them "pea vines," and stir-frying them with shrimp meat has a wonderful synergistic effect. In recent years, they have been canned for storage, so they are available in all seasons. Lettuce is refreshing and delicious when eaten fresh, and Suzhou wild game shops and candy stores make lettuce into sliced shoots, which are green and very pleasing to the eye. As for water shield, it is also a special product of Taihu Lake, and it is exceptionally delicious when cooked with shredded chicken during the Qingming period. However, the flavor of canned water shield is far inferior to the fresh version.</p>

<p>Chapter 10: Rudely Displaying Wealth Before a Young Woman, Coveting the Wall and Getting Sick, Losing Integrity</p>
<p>So he continued, I'm just relaying what Master Jia said. Whether you agree or not is naturally up to you two women. I can't force you, can I? If you're saying your family is waiting for the money to live on, there's money to take back right away, what's wrong with that? It's good that you've already agreed to give yourself to Master Jia, it's not like a random stranger. If you agree now, according to you, you'd pick a date, and after picking a good date, wouldn't you still have to send the girl to this hotel to accompany him? Sooner rather than later, I don't think there's anything wrong with that. As he said this, he smiled obsequiously at the others. What did Zhu Hush know? After listening to what the matchmaker said, she thought it over and over and felt that what he said made sense. Since she had agreed to give the girl to him, what did it matter if she gave her sooner rather than later? As long as she could take this pile of silver dollars home, she could take care of so many things. If the girl stayed here, it wasn't like he'd take a piece of her flesh, at most it would just be like she'd become a bride in a daze. As she thought this in her heart, she couldn't help but steal a few glances at the pile of silver dollars, then looked at the girl again. She thought to herself, thinking that people are about to starve to death, what's the point of talking about face? Like selling the girl a few years ago and sending her to someone else? So she said to the matchmaker, Mr. Zhang, am I just leaving her here like this? Although she was brave enough to ask this question, she was still timid, and her voice trembled as she spoke, and the words were also vague. (151)</p>

<h3>Finance: The Exchange Rate Weakens; The Premium Falls Back to Over Three Yuan; The Central Bank Initially Opens Strong but Repeatedly Rebounds Midway; Many Bulls Close Positions, Resulting in Final Weakness</h3>
<p>The gold market yesterday saw a rebound in overseas silver markets, and the subsequent rise after the closing, which led to a strengthening exchange rate. Many bulls emerged, causing a significant drop. However, midway through, due to the Central Bank and Sassoon buying sterling, there were many rebounds after the initial decline. In the morning, overseas silver markets saw British gains and American losses, with ongoing rises after large-scale trading closures. The forward silver price in Montri rose by 7.5 to 1 fen. London raw gold rose by 1 shilling and 5.5 pence. The exchange rate continued to shrink. Off-market preliminary trading opened and immediately retreated to 67-68 yuan. Shortly after, it rose from 65-66 yuan to 70 yuan, driven by the combined purchases of Hanheng and Taichang. The Central Bank's official rate was revealed late, with the standard premium rising to 932.9 yuan. The morning opening was still low. After the opening, market sentiment remained weak. With any supply, a decline was immediately seen. However, due to continued bank purchases, there were repeated rebounds after the decline, but the 70 yuan mark was not breached. Chinese merchants felt quite uneasy. The exchange rate strengthened, and the HSBC official rate was revealed, with a sharp drop that broke the 60 yuan mark. However, the banks took advantage of the low prices to continue buying, which helped to maintain the price. Later, the Central Bank and Sassoon competed to buy sterling, which boosted market confidence, and the price revolved and rose. The news that the Central Bank intervened to open spot trading at 865 yuan immediately caused a rise and broke through the 70 yuan mark. However, due to the ordinary psychology of Chinese merchants and the loosening of the exchange rate, many sold off, leading to a gradual decline, which once again broke the 60 yuan mark. However, the banks continued to buy, and the noon closing showed a rise. In the afternoon, the Central Bank continued to aggressively purchase sterling, stabilizing the market. However, as the banks' appetite decreased and Chinese merchants showed similar behavior, the exchange rate ultimately failed to sustain itself, leading to sellers becoming active and many bulls closing their positions. Supply exceeded demand, and the price gradually declined. The Indian silver report lengthened, and there was no hope of a rebound for large trades, leading to a drop within the 60 yuan range. After this, major players bought in at the low prices, but sellers also became active, so the rise was only temporary after the decline. After the closing, the trend seemed weak. The day's rise lacked momentum, and many major players sold off, putting pressure on buyers. In addition, the previous sharp rise had been too great, so the decline was naturally forceful. The future seems uncertain. Here is a record of the day's market conditions:</p>

<h3>Large Trades Rise; Foreign Exchange Supply Exceeds Demand; Sassoon and the Central Bank Aggressively Buy Sterling; The Struggle Results in Strengthening of Both British and American Currencies</h3>

At closing, the United States bought according to the official rate plus .1875, with the last buyer at .0625 and the seller above .125. The New York silver price shrunk by .125.

The Central Bank's official rate was revealed, with the British pound flat and the U.S. dollar falling by .125. The customs gold unit rose by 1.8 fen. The process after opening was unstable. Although the banks bought, Chinese merchants had a strong desire to sell. The HSBC official rate was revealed, with the British pound rising by .25 and the U.S. dollar rising by .4375. The process gradually hardened. Later, the banks took advantage of the low prices to buy, which helped to maintain the price. Later, the Central Bank and Sassoon worked hard to buy British exchange, which made the process tighter. The Central Bank's aggressive buying was particularly strong, and the overall trend improved. However, due to the poor psychology of Chinese merchants, although the Central Bank had opened spot trading, the process hardened, but the banks took advantage of the low prices to maintain the price. The mid-day situation was stable. In the afternoon, the Central Bank still came to aggressively buy, which stabilized the situation. However, the banks' desire to sell was still strong, and the psychology of Chinese merchants was not strong, so the maintenance lacked strength. The Indian silver report lengthened by 5 annas, and the process hardened. In the end, the banks took advantage of the low prices to buy, which helped to support the price. At the closing, the recent selling price was 1 shilling, 7 pence, and .5625 for the British exchange, and 38.6875 yuan for the U.S. exchange. Compared to the previous closing, the British pound loosened by .5 pence and the U.S. dollar hardened by .8125.

<h3>The Money Supply Is Apparently Loose; Interbank Lending Rate Reduced by One Fen</h3>
<p>Recently, due to the sluggish market and the difficulty of lending in the money industry, it has resulted in closed doors and no lending, making it impossible for various businesses to turn around funds. Since the opening of business on the 5th, over the past month, it has been very cautious to open accounts with money shops and banks. Even old accounts are unwilling to be opened. As a result, businesses have been unable to sustain themselves, and there have been frequent reports of businesses ceasing operations. However, the money supply has largely become looser, and the interbank lending rate in the market has fallen. Yesterday's noon market was all at 8 fen, a decrease of 1 fen compared to the previous day. Added interest for overdue loans was also non-existent, and was all treated as a write-off. Interbank bill transactions and reciprocal transactions were special. Morning trading turnover was over 2.5 million, new trading was over 400,000. Noon trading turnover was over 600,000. Trading in the Small General Association was over 300,000. 600,000 banknotes were withdrawn, and 800,000 were issued. Gold pawn transactions of redemption and new issues exceeded 1 million. The source of customer routes was over 300,000, with sales to Hankou and the Yangtze River of 400,000. Bank collections: foreign banks collected over 1.6 million in collections, over 4.1 million in collections for various goods, exchange pawns, and miscellaneous taxes, over 700,000 in special exchange funds, over 1.5 million in foreign exchange settlement funds, and 300,000 in warehouse entries. Chinese banks collected over 2.5 million in bill collections, over 5 million in collections for various goods, exchange pawns, miscellaneous taxes, and over 800,000 in special exchange funds, over 1.4 million in foreign exchange settlement funds, and 500,000 in warehouse exits. Japanese banks collected over 1.6 million in bill collections, over 3.2 million in collections for various goods, exchange pawns, and miscellaneous taxes, over 800,000 in special exchange funds, over 1.1 million in foreign exchange settlement funds, and 600,000 in warehouse entries.

<p>[Fluctuations in Subsidiary Currency]</p>
<p>Yesterday in the subsidiary currency market, there was very little rise and fall. Jiangnan small foreign currency was 835.5 yuan in the morning, a decrease of 2 yuan from the previous day, with 2,000 jiao of transactions. The noon market was the same, with no reported transactions. Guangdong small foreign currency was 733 yuan, a decrease of 2 jiao from the previous day, with 160,000 jiao of transactions.

Copper coins rose by 500 wen, to 331,500 wen, with 42,432,000 wen of transactions, equivalent to 12,800 yuan.</p>
<h3>Securities: Bond Short Positions Build Higher Barriers</h3>
<p>Yesterday at the Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange, because the international loan was still in the brewing stage and had not yet become a reality, market sentiment was therefore both doubtful and half-believing. The short positions on the surface built higher and higher barriers, and the pressure became heavier and heavier, so the reaction was stronger. The absorption of the 23rd, 4th, and 20th issues gradually became firmer, and there were no major disturbances in the future. The process yesterday: at the morning opening, initially bearing the decline from the previous day's closing, the first two or three types remained weak and lackluster. After the entry, as soon as major players made a move to buy, the market price immediately turned to the upside. Gold shorts rose sharply by half a yuan, and the rest also rose by 3-4 jiao. In the second session, sellers surged slightly, and most of the gains were lost, falling back by 5 fen, 1 jiao to 3 jiao. Compiled remains of the 20th issue rose by 3-4 jiao, with a slightly chaotic appearance. At the afternoon opening, the price rebounded slightly by about 1 jiao, and the closing price rebounded by 2-3 jiao. As soon as the trend slightly declined, shorts were covered, and the surface was tight. The market price result was quite different, with both rises and falls, ranging from 5 fen, 1 jiao to 2-3 jiao. Only gold shorts rose by 5 jiao, making it the most favorable. Military cutbacks 20th issue still fell by 2-3 jiao. The total number of transactions was about 10 million yuan. Here is a comparative table of the results of the rises and falls (unit: yuan):</p>
<h3>The US Dollar No Longer Devalues: New York Stock Market Plunges After Rising</h3>
<p>According to a report from the New Feng Foreign Firm, yesterday (the 6th), the New York stock market fell to a new low. A counselor from the White House solemnly declared that President Roosevelt's remarks at a press conference did not in any way imply a further reduction in the gold content of the US dollar. After talking with reporters in the morning, Wall Street speculators believed that Roosevelt's words hinted at the possibility of another devaluation of the dollar. Mining stocks rose sharply, and other stocks followed suit. The rise was further fueled by short covering and the weakness of the dollar. At the same time, grains also soared, and government bonds plummeted, causing anxiety to the Treasury Department, which was about to issue new bonds. Roosevelt then instructed his counselor to explain his remarks, stating that all speculation about a further devaluation of the dollar was entirely unfounded. After this statement was released, market trends immediately reversed, with stocks plunging, government bonds rebounding, the dollar strengthening, and grains falling. A total of 1.29 million shares were traded throughout the day. The Dow Jones index is listed below:</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cloth: Bulls Secretly Exit, Marked Yarn Suddenly Plummets</h3>
<p>After rising for two consecutive days, yarn prices plummeted again yesterday. However, spot yarn sales were brisk, and the Henan, Guangdong, and Tianjin merchants continued to actively purchase spot goods. Nevertheless, market sentiment failed to rally, mainly because the core members of the bull organization were selling off large quantities of yarn from other accounts, causing the market to decline.</p>
<p>"Golden Rooster" Brand Yarn Drops 1.5 Yuan; Marked Yarn Plunges in the Morning Session</p>
<p>Due to the weakening gold market, the opening of the marked yarn market saw declines across all months, and the downward trend resumed. However, trading on the floor was quiet. As a result, all months fell by 6.7.8 to 1 yuan. The afternoon session opened weaker, and prices continued to fall, with sluggish sentiment. However, spot yarn sales were enthusiastic, with coarse yarn transactions in North China being particularly active. The marked yarn market price showed significant instability. According to market rumors, bullish parties had been gradually selling off, leading to poor sentiment and a market decline. The current month fell by 1.2 yuan, and distant months fell by 5.7.8 yuan. Sales included 750 bales from Mingde, 800 bales from Changyu, 1,350 bales from Runkang, 450 bales from Shengyuan, 600 bales from Taichang, 800 bales from Changfeng, and 400 bales from Xincheng.

<h3>Inventory Congestion: Cotton Market's Decline Intensifies</h3>
<p>The cotton market was weak and the downward trend intensified. Due to a slight drop in American cotton and the chaotic state of gold prices, buyers in the market reduced their purchases, resulting in market instability. The main reason for this was the excessive cotton inventory, causing widespread anxiety. As market conditions changed, the downward trend became more severe. However, Yuanda continued to purchase on dips.</p>
<p>Zheng Standard Cotton Falls 6.7 Jiao</p>
<p>The morning session of marked cotton trading opened with sharp declines across all months. Due to the turmoil in the gold market and rumors of difficulties in securing loans from the UK, combined with expectations of continued long positions in exchange rates, there was a lack of short covering in the market. Market sentiment changed, and the downward trend worsened. As a result, all months fell by 0.35 to 0.45 yuan. The afternoon session remained weak. Later, news that the gold market was still declining and the yarn market was not performing well caused prices to weaken further in the second and third rounds of trading. The market closed even weaker. As a result, all months fell again by 1.2.3 jiao. Sales included 7,100 dan from Gengfeng, 7,000 dan from Dafeng, 2,200 dan from Tongji, 2,000 dan from Runkang, 1,400 dan from Yuanyi, 1,800 dan from Yongchang, and 2,000 dan from Yifeng.

<h3>Bull and Bear Positions Expand in Marked Cotton</h3>
<p>The number of marked cotton accounts in the Shanghai Yarn and Cloth Exchange, as of March 6th, totaled 87,300 dan for March contracts, 121,800 dan for April contracts, 145,800 dan for May contracts, 134,200 dan for June contracts, 128,500 dan for July contracts, and 39,200 dan for August contracts, for a total of 664,800 dan. This is an increase of 77,000 dan compared to the 587,800 dan at the end of February. The battle lines between bulls and bears have expanded, and the increase in trading volume has led to more drastic changes. It is found that the main sellers are Japanese and Ningbo merchants, while the main buyers are factories and speculators. The largest buying and selling volumes are as follows:</p>
<p>Sellers: Buyers</p>
<p>Sellers: Jifeng: 25,900</p>
<p>Tongji: 17,300</p>

<h3>American Cotton Falls, British Cotton News Is Not Good—The Hankou Cotton Market Is Extremely Depressed—</h3>
<p>American cotton opened with declines as unfavorable news from Liverpool led foreign merchants to sell off, resulting in declines of 2 to 6 points per pound across all months. However, domestic traders continued to buy within limited prices. Later, President Roosevelt's renewed remarks on inflation and the rise in the wheat and stock markets caused a reaction, leading buyers to become cautious. The main outlets were local operators and the New Orleans merchants. Eventually, the White House clarified that its policy remained unchanged, causing stock and wheat prices to fall and bulls to liquidate their positions, resulting in renewed weakness. The "Commercial News" estimated that the cotton acreage for this year would be 31,480,000 mu. The market closed weakly, with spot prices falling by 5 points per pound and futures prices falling by 6 to 10 points per pound. The British cotton market was stable, with spot prices falling by 1 point and futures prices rising by 2 points. The Indian cotton market was closed. The original telegram is listed below (dated the 6th).</p>
<p>According to a telegram from Mumbai dated the 7th, the opening forecast for White Rose cotton was 245 rupees, a decrease of 1.5 rupees compared to the previous day's close.</p>
<p>A telegram from Manchester dated the 6th stated that the yarn market fluctuated with the exchange rate, and selling prices were slightly firm. 20-count yarn sold for 10 1/8 to 11 1/8 pence, 30-count yarn sold for 11 1/8 to 12 1/8 pence, and 40-count yarn sold for 12 1/8 to 13 3/8 pence, all up by 1/8 pence. Egyptian cotton 60-count yarn sold for 16 to 17 pence, unchanged.</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: The cotton market in this city is becoming increasingly depressed, which is alarming. Sales channels in all directions have been cut off. Market prices have plummeted by 1.2 yuan per dan compared to before the Spring Festival. Only one factory, Shenxin Factory, came to the market to purchase 170 small pieces of He Kou cotton, equivalent to 1,630 dan and 60 jin according to the city's scale. The recent market prices are listed below:</p>
<p>Tianmen Cotton: Price: 33.5 yuan</p>
<p>Yuekou Cotton: Price: 33.3 yuan</p>
<p>Shayang Cotton: Price: 33.9 yuan</p>
<p>Hekou Cotton: Price: 33.6 yuan</p>
<h3>Grains: Flour and Wheat Move Downward Together</h3>
<p>The flour market was based on imported wheat prices. Chicago fell by 0.20 yuan, and Canada fell by 0.04 to 0.20 yuan. Furthermore, the sharp drop in gold prices also caused opening prices to be implicitly reduced by about 0.02 yuan for all months. The current month then stabilized after an initial softening due to short covering and still tight spot supplies. However, distant months saw customers selling and shorts covering, preventing a sharp decline. In the afternoon session, the current month became firmer due to brisk trading by out-of-town merchants, while distant months remained weak due to the continued decline in gold prices. However, trading volume was light as both buyers and sellers were hesitant. As a result, the current month fell by 0.075 yuan, April fell by 0.0175 yuan, May fell by 0.02 yuan, June fell by 0.03 yuan, July fell by 0.0275 yuan, and August fell by 0.0225 yuan.</p>
<p>Transactions in all months of the wheat market were sluggish. Prices were based on imported wheat, and the decline in gold prices naturally softened sentiment. However, although the wheat market is related to foreign exchange rates, buyers must have physical goods to engage in legitimate trading, which is different from pure speculation. Therefore, selling pressure was light in both the morning and afternoon, resulting in only a weak market and limited declines. As a result, March and April each fell by 0.03 yuan, and August fell by 0.03 yuan. The spot wheat market saw firm prices for high-quality wheat, while medium and lower-quality wheat were average. Shandong Dezhou and Suzhou wheat opened at 3.77 yuan, and Bengbu Mingguang, Xinpu, and Fuzhou wheat opened at 3.75 yuan. Neixin sold 2,500 bags, and Shenda sold 1,000 bags.</p>
<p>Chicago Wheat:</p>
<p>May: 95.875, 95.125, down 0.750</p>
<p>July: 90.500, 89.625, down 0.875</p>
<p>September: 89.875, 89.000, down 0.875</p>
<p>Spot: No market, 104.875</p>
<p>Canadian Wheat:</p>
<p>May: 83.500, 83.375, down 0.125</p>
<p>July: 83.375, 83.250, down 0.125</p>
<p>Spot: 81.000, 80.750, down 0.250</p>
<h3>Zhongguan Thin Rice Recovers Slightly</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, more than ten merchants from various provinces brought goods (a total of over 2,000 shi). Although sales were average and demand was unchanged, the market sentiment stabilized slightly due to the recent scarcity of arrivals and the depletion of inventory downstream. Therefore, the market color has turned stable. Prices for thick japonica and thin rice showed no change. Zhongguan late rice recovered slightly by a few fen. Dujian, Yinbianyuan, and other varieties also showed no fluctuations.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, approximately twenty ships arrived downstream. Various goods were sold on the market. There was some trading in white japonica, but thin rice was average, Yang Dujian was difficult to sell, and there were few inquiries for Baiyuan. Market prices saw white japonica recover by 0.1 to 0.2 yuan, and thin rice tightened by a few fen. The prices of other goods were similar to before.</p>
<h3>3,000 Bags of Large Milled Rice Sold on the Spot</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the imported rice market remained firm. Along the Yangtze River from Hankou to Jiujiang, traders have been independently packaging rice (approximately 300,000 bags), so there has been less new trading in the market. However, the domestic market within this area has become more active, no longer being in a state of holding down prices like before. Traders here have purchased over 4,000 bags of Saigon No. 13, 2,600 bags of Saigon No. 3 for domestic use, 2,000 bags of broken rice, 500 bags of Siam No. 3, 1,000 bags of small milled rice, 500 bags of Mindang rice, and 3,000 bags of large milled rice. The large milled rice was the first spot to be sold and had a good price, selling for 9.2 yuan. Traders believe it to be a secondary grade of small milled rice No. 3. Yesterday's selling prices were similar to the previous day, but the situation was very good. If sales continue to be strong in the future, there may be hope for further price increases. Hunan Jihong rice (customer xiān) was purchased by traders here for domestic use at 250 bags, with a price of 10.023 yuan, an increase of 0.1 yuan compared to the previous market.</p>
<h3>Soybeans Lack Upward Momentum</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the soybean market maintained the good market conditions of the previous day, but it was difficult for the overall trend to rise because purchasing power was weak and prices stopped rising when they reached a certain level. The overall market was stable, but the underlying trend was weak. Factories purchased three truckloads of all Hebei beans at a price of 3.65 yuan. Domestic buyers purchased 200 bags of Guide beans at a price of 3.75 yuan, over 200 bags of Bozhou beans at a price of 3.5 to 4.5 yuan, and over 100 bags of Yingzhou beans at a price of 3.62 yuan. 400 bags of Xicheng beans were traded here at a price of 4.7 yuan, and 100 bags of Shashi beans were traded at a price of 3.37 yuan. Domestic buyers purchased over 800 bags of Hankou Zha beans at a price ranging from 3.45 to 3.6 yuan.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: This Factory's Cotton White Recovers Slightly by 0.2 Jiao</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market saw a slight easing of customs gold, initially at 1.790 and then at 1.788, leading to a leveling trend. The association's clearing price for No. 24 coarse granulated white sugar was raised by 0.1 yuan to 17 yuan, but there was no demand. Re-export goods were priced at 4.95 yuan, with 250 bags traded. Customs bonded goods were priced at 4.9 yuan but no transactions occurred. No. 8 and 9 Dutch red sugar was priced at 13 yuan, and Taikoo B wheat was priced at 18 yuan, but none were cleared. This factory's cotton white sugar, which had risen too sharply the previous day, saw a slight recovery of 0.2 jiao yesterday due to the easing of customs gold. Zhenyu No. 1 was priced at 16.5 yuan, No. 2 at 16.4 yuan, No. 3 at 16.25 yuan, and No. 4 at 16.1 yuan. The goods from Chaoqihao are currently being declared to customs and there are still some hand-carried goods that are being held for the time being, resulting in no transactions yesterday.</p>
<h3>Dried and Preserved Goods: Shima Longan Arrives in Small Quantities</h3>
<p>Shima longan was said to have been difficult to negotiate due to the influx of Quanzhou inferior goods last winter, resulting in very favorable prices. As inventory of small and medium-sized grains of general shipments dwindled, prices gradually improved, and Shima longan is also approaching a suitable price. It was found that some goods have already arrived through Guangzhou轮轮, and the market is expected to open in a few days.</p>
<h3>Oil Market: Hongjiang Tung Oil's Rising Trend Has Subsided</h3>
<p>Since the spring trading of Hongjiang tung oil in this port, the price of secondary Hongjiang oil has been stable at 23.4 yuan per barrel. Until last week, the new first trading price in Zhenjiang was also publicly negotiated and opened, and the calculated price was similar to the spring trading price negotiated in this port. However, after trading, it seemed that it was smart, and it is now heard that the numbers have not been fixed, and the market has become nervous. Last night, a telegram came from Zhenjiang saying that Zhenghong, Jichang, and He tung oil must be sold for 28 yuan per barrel, and secondary Hongjiang oil will not be sold. Although it was not explicitly stated how much it would increase, the implication was obvious, and it was expected that it would increase by 0.7 or 0.8 yuan. The reason for the increase is nothing more than the influence of white tung oil. Since white tung oil has soared, the cost of Hongjiang tung oil has also increased, and the production volume of each oil pressing workshop may have decreased as a result. Therefore, the new goods currently arriving may be hoarded for profit. The lowest limit for the selling price of secondary Hongjiang oil in this port is expected to be around 24 yuan.</p>

<h3>"A Dog Bites Lü Dongbin"</h3>
<p>— Hanfeng</p>
<p>Zheng of Changle edited and printed "Miscellaneous Dramas of the Qing Dynasty," which includes four kinds of dramas by Ye Chengzong (Yi Sheng). The "Kong Fang Brother" excerpt "is a dramatized theory of the god of money, which expresses the greatness of the power of the god of money through the solo of the Confucian scholar Jin Geng, and is a work of anger at the world" (Xi Di's interpretation). The power of the so-called god of money can move ghosts and gods, so Jin Geng sang:</p>
<p>Heaven also loves money, the Heavenly Money Star shines in the blue sky;</p>
<p>The earth also loves money, the ancient Qiantang surges with the Zhejiang tide;</p>
<p>The wood also loves money, the elm money drifts in the spring painting;</p>
<p>The flowers also love money, the golden money flowers are beautiful;</p>
<p>The horse also loves money, the golden money horse has a high price;</p>
<p>The leopard also loves money, the golden money leopard roars with its nature;</p>
<p>The gods also love money, they ask about the six lines with golden money;</p>
<p>Ghosts also love money, they burn paper money on the road to the underworld;</p>
<p>The literati also love money, they select young talents with green money;</p>
<p>The warriors also love money, they compete with golden money in archery.</p>
<p>This song "Rear Courtyard Flower" explains that money is loved by everyone, loved by animals, and loved by ghosts and gods. "What will happen if there is no money for a day?" This is the fact, so Ye Chengzong satirically concludes: "Father Kong Fang, I only rely on your knees, I beg you, Chunting," and says that if there is no money for a day, then:</p>
<p>The pot is short of grain, the stove is short of firewood, the kitchen is short of fine food, the jar is short of fragrant wine;</p>
<p>Friends are few, relatives are few, wives are nagging, servants are chattering;</p>
<p>There is skin but no hair, there is meat but no fat, the belly is empty, the foolish dream is in vain;</p>
<p>The heart is like oiled, the throat is like smoked, the sweat is like pouring, the eyes are like shaking bells;</p>
<p>It is difficult to escape with wings, it is difficult to be spared, it is difficult to eliminate the suffering, it is difficult to endure the living sin;</p>
<p>There is no exchange for borrowing, there is no pride for beggars, there is no nest for selling, there is no robe for pawning;</p>
<p>Try hard to frown and cannot get half a cent, only to end up dry and anxious! (Qing Ge Er!)</p>
<p>Ye Chengzong's indignation can be imagined here. However, what he hates seems not to be "money" itself, but the "dogs" who run errands for officials. He wrote the four-act "A Dog Bites Lü Dongbin," and his purpose was probably here, although he ultimately could not avoid fantasy, wanting to awaken the "dogs" so that they could also become immortals, recover their spirituality, and ascend to immortality together.</p>
<p>The story, as Xi Di said, "uses the common saying 'a dog bites Lü Dongbin, not knowing a good person' as a point, and Pingdu adds Shi Jie as a person, with the matter of Dongbin leading Jie to become an immortal as the center. "The wedge says that Dongbin travels around and passes by Mount Tai. He sees the scholar Shi Youdao in the clouds and decides to save him. The first act says that Dongbin acts as a wandering monk to enlighten Shi Jie, asking him to donate to build a temple, but Jie at this time is:</p>
<p>All the scraping in the house is nothing more than incomplete notes;</p>
<p>All the investigation in the belly cannot help your front and back mansion;</p>
<p>All the flapping in the mouth cannot be worth a rafter or tile. (That Zha Ling)</p>
<p>He doesn't even have a place to insert this five-zang temple. Finally, Dongbin asks for "a clear conversation for one night, which is also a predestined relationship." He feels that Shi Jie is a person who "still has the habits of a celebrity, and this is the root of the disaster." The second act writes that Lü Jie returns to the city to visit friends the next day, and meets Cai Qi, a night patrol officer, and his dog, which is "quite capable of biting people." Lü Jie is used to "wearing casual clothes and having a mountain forest nature," and does not pay attention to it, so he is taken down. He hates it extremely, scolding Cai Qi:</p>
<p>I have heard of your name for a long time, and only now do I know Jing. It is nothing more than cats and mice in the public hall, fire consumption and levies, fines and punishments. I ask you, brother, do you have Cai Jing? Besides this, what virtue do you have? What face do you have to compete with people? (Shang Xiao Lou)</p>
<p>Cai Qi "can't beat him, can't talk him down," and tells the dog to bite him and send him to the east corridor of the Tai Temple to freeze, preparing to freeze him to death. But Shi Jie is not afraid, nor does he submit. He continues to scold all the way, scolding all the way to the Tai Temple:</p>
<p>Could it be that the Old Mother of Mount Tai has no divinity, and allows this living being under her feet? You wield authority and issue orders, you set fire and I will not allow you to light lanterns. (Yao Hai Er)</p>
<p>The third act writes that Dongbin learns of this matter and goes to enlighten him again. He first instructs the Willow Tree Spirit: "Shi Sheng is trapped, and I want to enlighten Cai Qi. I am afraid that he will not understand, so only at noon, create wind and fog, and the sky will be dark. Cai Qi will surely be afraid, and Shi Sheng will be released." Then he goes to find Cai Qi himself, but unexpectedly, the dog suddenly comes out and bites Dongbin, biting him many times. Dongbin then bursts out scolding the dog:</p>
<p>Ah! I only see a fierce dog coming out of the vermilion door, showing the power of the eastern people. Dog, the lanugo on your head has not yet receded, and you are already showing off your power... (Xiao Tao Hong)</p>
<p>Dog! Waiting to eat, you have things, you can't say whether the warehouse has surplus grain or is hungry. There are so many vagrants in the ditch, but you, the killer, eat your fill and have no scruples... (Tiao Xiao Ling)</p>
<p>You make me furious with your wolf's heart and dog's lungs, and deceive good people since ancient times. Even if you are a divine mastiff, you will be killed by Mi Ming. What dog knowledge, what dog scheming, what infatuation! (Tu Si Er) Dogs rely on people's power, like tigers helping foxes. Laughing at vicious dogs barking and disturbing Yao, it is your dog party that is doing this. (Ma Lang Er)</p>
<p>Then Dongbin casts a spell to threaten Cai Qi and release Lü Jie. But at this time, the dog also changed its appearance. "Looking at this dog, I only see it begging for pity and wagging its tail. Could it be that the dog also intends to turn its heart back?" The fourth act is probably a long time later. Lü Jie "passed the imperial examination and was appointed censor. He returned to his hometown in brocade," and he felt that "prosperity and decline are things that people cannot know, as if they were in the Road of Handan." But Cai Qi was distressed, fearing that he would take revenge, so he hurriedly repaired Shi Jie's old residence to atone for his previous sins. Shi Jie found it ridiculous and instead rebuked him, "Who told you to repair my Shi's old thatched cottage where books are stored? How dare you chop down the plum blossoms in front of my small window!" When he saw the dog begging for pity and wagging its tail, he sang again:</p>
<p>Yesterday you were dancing your claws and baring your teeth, wagging your head and tail, and biting each other fiercely, showing off your rudeness. How can you now wag your tail and beg for pity, hang your head and lose your temper, with all kinds of tones? Don't expect me to spare you lightly. (Tian Shui Ling)</p>
<p>At this time, Dongbin comes again to save Shi Jie, and Jie also feels that this time of being an official is "forced into a monkey suit, learning to be a puppet, only to end up with his tail bare," so he "takes off his court clothes, puts on a cloth robe, removes his precious belt, ties a silk cord, puts on straw shoes and throws away his boots, changes his nine-sun scarf, and dresses up as an immortal" (Gu Mei Jiu), "never entering the circle of fame and fortune again," and the "dog" is also saved along with him.</p>
<p>The general situation of the whole drama is like this. It is easy to understand that the author, Ye Chengzong, is a person with a belly full of complaints. In "Kong Fang Brother," he curses money; in "Thirteen Niang," he laments "Hearing about injustice makes his eyes split, who can borrow the chivalrous heart?"; in "Jia Langxian," he indignantly points out that writing is useless, "but empty fame and noise cannot save him from the cold." And "Lü Dongbin" is even more indignant and scolds fiercely, from Cai Qi to the Celestial Mastiff.</p>
<p>He used articles to criticize the social injustice and political corruption of the time, hoping that great immortals and chivalrous people would come out. It is not surprising that a writer who grew up in a feudal society would have such views. However, his expectations seem to be more than that, that is, he not only hopes that these "injustices in the world" will be eliminated by the immortals and heroes, but also hopes that those bandit-like people can also be saved and lay down their butcher knives.</p>
<p>This is the consistent thought of Taoism, and it is also the consistent unrealistic fantasy. At that time, Ye Chengzong was not the only writer who was like this.</p>
<h3>One Day</h3>
<p>— Qian Dong</p>
<p>I woke up early in the morning, holding a pen and rustling, preparing to write something I could be satisfied with. However, my mother was also scraping the remaining rice in the rice box with a rustling sound.</p>
<p>The rice is gone again!</p>
<p>I put down my pen; I couldn't write anything more.</p>
<p>My mother was quietly counting the days, the seventh, the eighth… She took the remaining rice downstairs to wash it, muttering to herself, "Why are we eating so fast?"</p>
<p>My wife, who was washing diapers, rushed upstairs in a hurry. She whispered to me anxiously, "We have to buy rice again today. Go out in the afternoon!"</p>
<p>I nodded. She ran back downstairs to wash diapers.</p>
<p>My younger sister smiled, tidied her books, and went to school.</p>
<p>The sun had already touched the ground. I wanted to pick up my pen again, but the child sleeping in the cradle started coughing fiercely again. He cried so pitifully, like a lone ape wailing under the pale moonlight, lingering and mournful. This had been going on for four days.</p>
<p>I put down my pen again, dragged the cradle over, and sang a lullaby to him with my withered voice. But he still cried so mournfully, his two tearful little eyes fixed on me, crying to me with "咿咿嗚嗚," and I didn't understand his words.</p>
<p>At this moment, this sound was so sad that I simply couldn't listen. I once thought that if I killed him with a knife, he wouldn't resist at all. Perhaps when the blade touched his neck, he would think I was treating his cough-broken throat. It was because of this defenseless blade that I gently retracted the sword that had killed many powerful enemies. Instead, this defenseless blade pierced my heart!</p>
<p>In the past, I always felt that men should never cry, no matter what. Now, I was crying at the child's withered face, and tears streamed down profusely.</p>
<p>Lunch was already cooked, and my younger sister was home from school, but we didn't have the usual joyful sounds.</p>
<p>My mother silently ate a shallow bowl of rice and stopped.</p>
<p>"What? There's still rice," I said.</p>
<p>"No, I'm very full. When I woke up this morning, my stomach felt a bit full, stuffy," she said, hiccupping.</p>
<p>My wife only ate one bowl of rice and stopped, saying she felt a bit unwell. My younger sister also put down her rice bowl. I uneasily ate one bowl of rice and also put down my chopsticks.</p>
<p>The child started crying again. My wife, holding the child, stared at me and said, "Then, are you going out in the afternoon?"</p>
<p>"Yes, I'll go out!"</p>
<p>I replied. I brushed the dust off my clothes, wiped my worn-out leather shoes, and left.</p>
<p>The sky became overcast, and a brown wind blew wildly. The roads were like a dense spider web, one here, one there. Streetcars and cars flew back and forth in the brown wind. I hesitated, asking myself:</p>
<p>"Where to go?"</p>
<h3>Dead Emotions</h3>
<p>— Wei Zhongtian</p>
<p>It's still a night with such a clear moon, still a small path with willows planted on both sides, just like three years ago, when I walked through with my lonely and isolated heart, I would stand still, or wander around, raising my head to look at the sparkling stars, lowering my head to look at my shadow, making all kinds of absurd dreams, and in the end, when I got tired, I would leave the small path with a dry laugh. But now I still walk through such a small path alone, however, this situation can no longer inspire me to make those absurd dreams, and all the sentimental emotions of the past are dead.</p>
<p>So-called "youth," so-called "happiness," have deceived me of a lot of enthusiasm, a lot of tears, and made me spend a lot of long years in boredom. Now I have awakened, and from now on I will no longer be absurd or stupid, and I will no longer bite my fingers in sorrow and disappointment.</p>
<p>Young people should have vigor and a strong will. The difficult life of the past few years has told me that it is not okay for a person to be too weak. Being disheartened and negative by any small stimulus or slight blow is not what a young person should be. Such a young person will eventually be abandoned on the beaches on both sides of the rolling tide. It is not bad for a person to encounter various difficulties and harsh environments when they are young, because in this environment, a person is often tempered to be stronger and more capable. I myself was rescued from a harsh environment and learned a lot of life knowledge. Today, I have even more courage to deal with the difficulties of the future.</p>
<p>Even though I say that, I still feel that my recent days have been a bit stupid, which may be because my desires are too great and too deep, so I feel dissatisfied and stupid in any environment! I have a lot of hopes. If hope turns into disappointment, it is of course bitter. Fortunately, if hope really reaches its goal, I will feel the boredom of being ordinary and boring. This often makes me feel that life is terribly stupid! Who can I blame for this? I can only blame myself. There was a time when I always hoped to come to Japan to see the autumn leaves, thinking that sitting under the maple trees, reading my favorite books, and picking one or two leaves when I was happy to put in my favorite books as bookmarks, and after one or ten years, when I had the opportunity to reopen that favorite book, and found the maple leaves, recalling all the situations at that time, would be very pleasant. Now, I have seen the maple leaves, but what do the maple leaves give me? Nothing. If I have to say, it is that pile of melancholy.</p>
<p>The weather is getting warmer day by day, and there seems to be a little bit of spring in the sunlight. Soon, spring will come again. Wait, when spring comes, the cherry blossoms will also bloom. Cherry blossoms, the two words "cherry blossoms" have also made me love them. I dare not say anything now. After seeing the cherry blossoms, I will record my mood.</p>
<p>Recently, I seem to feel a little lonely, so the day before yesterday I bought a purple vase and a bunch of purple flowers (I like purple the most) and put them on my desk, thinking to adjust this life. When I am tired, I will smell these flowers, and I am full of thinking that there is a lot of warmth in the breath of these flowers to convey to me, but, disappointingly, they only give me a stuffy feeling of irritability, yes, this should be the case, because all those emotions of the past are dead.</p>
<h3>Toward Evening (16)</h3>
<p>— Qu Yi</p>
<p>"Oh! It turned out to be such a big bedbug!"</p>
<p>"A bedbug?" The new literary man sitting in the bathroom heard the discussion about bedbugs next door, and suddenly had an inspiration. He thought, "When I was in Japan, bedbugs were called Nanjing bugs. But now, when the national economy is bankrupt, we scholars have all become bedbug class."</p>
<p>However, Hu Yiyuan, sitting on the bed, shook his hand to stop the red-headed literary man from making fun of the female bedbug.</p>
<p>"In short, even though it's a bedbug, it's stinging in your heart! In your heart—"</p>
<p>"Haha!" There was a burst of laughter full of vitality. But in the laughter, there was suddenly a strange voice mixed in: "Young master! Young master!"</p>
<p>It wasn't until the laughter stopped that there was a voice, "You dump it out and take a look." – It was a voice with a bit of terror.</p>
<p>Hu Yiyuan immediately dragged his slippers out, but he couldn't find the broadcaster of the familiar voice in the room. The two "female army commanders" sitting beside the drunkard, stroking, caressing, laughing, and hugging, each indulging in the teasing of men and women, pointed their mouths at Hu Yiyuan towards the door, signaling. Hu Yiyuan went out the door again. Just a second. Hu Yiyuan came in with a panicked expression. The light in the room immediately turned pale.</p>
<p>"Go! Go! You get out of here quickly! The goods are here! The goods!"</p>
<p>As soon as they heard the word "goods," they, who originally belonged to the bedbug class, were naturally startled. Although they were smiling, their hearts had never been at ease for a moment. This was their life in the evening. Hu Yiyuan's somewhat surprised "go, go" sound, like the wind blowing through the cracks in the wall, naturally had a quick reaction at the end of their nerves. They immediately quietly retreated with solemn expressions. Then, Hu Yiyuan asked the red-headed literary man and Li An, who was still drunk and walking across half the country, to leave. Then he pulled his uncle again and whispered in his uncle's ear:</p>
<p>"It's over! Uncle, the trick has been exposed. That lottery ticket! That flood prize! Oh! Hurry! Let's go first. It's better to leave first!…"</p>
<p>The two of them also staggered out.</p>

<h3>The Worst Year for Youth</h3>
<p>— Chen</p>
<p>As the calendar for 1934 is placed on our desks, many political commentators and forecasters are crying out about the economic panic and the crisis of war, until the day of the "Great World Breakdown."</p>
<p>Mr. Di'aike, the secretary-general of the New York Christian Youth Association, said in his work report for 1934 that this year was one of the worst years for youth in American history. "The tragedy and heinousness of their panorama can hardly be determined forever, because the decline of spiritual and moral qualities is subtle and invisible, and difficult to statistically analyse. However, the wreckage of humanity is shocking, which is a fact. This moral decline is the result of the youth era spent in a world of war, followed by world reconstruction, unhealthy prosperity, and recession." It is also said that they feel "not needed by the world".</p>
<p>General idealists always explain the "moral decline" of mankind as caused by spiritual inferiority or lack of education, while neglecting the economic and material reasons. However, we will never doubt that the Anglo-Saxon youth, who have always prided themselves on being civilized, are spiritually inferior or lack education, but they "spent their youth in a world of war" and loved "the unhealthy prosperity and recession" causing them not to be needed by the noble, and therefore "morality declined". Just as we have unemployed college students, we produce "higher-level hooligans" who open schools to collect money, and the fact of college students stealing.</p>
<p>However, what we want to say is that the "moral decline" of youth comes with the end of the world and the current society. It is true that youth are "irresponsible," as Mr. Di'aike said, but it cannot be "remedied" by the "spiritual cultivation" used by organizations such as the New York Youth Association. Obviously, the center of current spiritual corruption is not in the general youth, but in the society that creates "unhealthy prosperity and recession" and the rule of this part of the people. It is precisely because of its existence that youth are in "a world of war," "not needed by the world," which leads to moral decline. Holding the doctrine of "spiritual cultivation" cannot break this environment, nor make him needed by the world, nor can he easily "follow up with world reconstruction."</p>
<p>We should not forget that it is always those "morally declining" slaves who can rebuild the world.</p>
<h3>Little Fifth Uncle</h3>
<p>— Jiang Tian</p>
<p>Fifth Uncle's age has passed his fifties, but because of his usual talkativeness and laughter, he doesn't look like an old man. So the children don't call him Fifth Uncle, but add a small character to the words Fifth Uncle, and everyone calls him Little Fifth Uncle. He doesn't get angry when he hears the children calling him that, but instead, he plays with the children as if he is happy.</p>
<p>Little Fifth Uncle can be regarded as a monster. He has liked to play since he was a child, and he hasn't changed his nature even when he is old. According to him, he has been running around the north and south since he was a child, and he has traveled to most of the major cities and small villages in many provinces. He knows all kinds of people, but he has never had trouble with anyone, and everyone can call him brother.</p>
<p>Having this kind of skill is not bad. But one thing is that he was born poor from his mother's womb, and he is still poor after half a century. He was a soldier during the Qing Dynasty, participated in the revolution during the revolution, worked as a waiter, worked as a long-term worker, worker, farmer, and did all kinds of chores. He has also been to Southeast Asia, so he often</p>
<h2>Page 19</h2>
<p>He often says to people: all the secrets of the world have been done, and he has tasted a lot of flavors. When he was forty years old, he settled down in his hometown to farm. He also found a wife for his son. But after a few years, his wife died, and he didn't have any problems, he was still as happy as a child, as if he didn't have any worries. When he was fifty years old, although his daughter-in-law had given birth to several children, none of them survived, and his son, who was in good health in his early twenties, died this year. This made him disappointed in everything, and the old man had to watch a young daughter-in-law live alone. Although he was unhappy in his heart, his old tune of talking and laughing was still as good as ever.</p>
<p>The children all liked him. When I was a child, I would ask him to tell jokes as soon as I saw him, as if he told them better than others.</p>
<p>As I grew older, I didn't have much contact with Little Fifth Uncle, but I couldn't forget his shadow in my mind. I was only seventeen when his son died. From that year on, I left my hometown and didn't go home. It wasn't until one lunar New Year three years ago that I returned to my hometown, which I hadn't seen for several years.</p>
<p>Walking into the gate of my hometown, I thought of Little Fifth Uncle. Little Fifth Uncle used to come to my house often. He knew I was back and would definitely come to see me, but after waiting for a day, I didn't see his shadow come to my house. The next morning, after getting out of bed, I asked my mother, and my mother said:</p>
<p>"He's already dead. He died last year. I forgot to tell you."</p>
<p>My mother said as she walked down the stairs. At this time, I was stunned when I heard my mother's words, and I was always thinking: would Little Fifth Uncle, who was lively and like a child, die so quickly? What about his young widow? I was thinking in my heart, and my feet couldn't help but move, and I ran towards his house.</p>
<p>Turning around and walking through a few quiet paths, I arrived at the entrance of Little Fifth Uncle's house. I looked at the door panel, the stone steps, the copper door ring, and the two faded good fortune characters on the door panel. Everything was like the old courtyard. Only the two white paper and black characters couplets were newly pasted on the door panel. I gently knocked on the door ring a few times, and the two wooden doors opened with a creak.</p>
<p>"Oh! Is it Uncle Zhi? Please come in and sit down!"</p>
<p>A middle-aged woman flashed before my eyes. She said something and let me go in first. As I walked, I said:</p>
<p>"Sister-in-law is still living here, is everything okay? Why don't you come to our house to play? You have to be happy during the New Year!"</p>
<p>She walked behind me, but didn't say a word. I sat and talked in the hall where Fifth Uncle's spiritual tablet was enshrined for a while and then left.</p>
<p>"There's no fun in living alone. People like Little Fifth Uncle have never had a good life until they get old. After they die, they leave a widow. She's only twenty-four or five years old this year, which is the period of youth. Has she endured it for a few years, and does she still want to endure it? In today's world, it's not easy to keep chastity. Let's be a nun. In this era, being a nun is not necessarily completely pure. What else does she want?"</p>
<p>As I thought, I walked, and I had already arrived at the entrance of my house.</p>
<h3>Glorious Days</h3>
<p>— Hua Zhi</p>
<p>It was the second spring since Genbao was released from prison.</p>
<p>Except for the winter when his father built three new thatched huts, he had spent a smiling New Year with flowered paper money. After that, he only spent a series of difficult New Years in sighs and sighs. Although in memory, drinking, gambling, singing community dramas, and secretly meeting with Sister Zhao behind the mountain, the deprivation of this kind of beautiful dream felt difficult. But every day, when he got up from the bed, he had to find a way to make two meals of rice porridge for the family. It was difficult to bear the hunger, and even if he thought of the grand occasion of building new thatched huts that year, he couldn't even force a smile. Spending a day was to delay life for one more day. He was afraid of the arrival of the New Year, which would make his life even more difficult. The beautiful dream was shattered and he couldn't find a trace of it in his mind.</p>
<p>So when he was locked into the county seat with wolf-like chains, he said with a long, roaring laugh to the neighbors who were seeing him off at the village entrance with helpless tears: "Okay! Let's go to the county seat to sit and eat for the New Year!" This tragic story is still considered heroic in the village. But who knew his mood behind the tears!</p>
<p>The old father with a glorious history, since his wife passed away, the dark net has been shrouded in his multi-textured face that has been tortured by work. In the bitter life, he still struggled with his remaining energy to help his son plow a few acres of thin fields, and what was given to him was that the three newly built thatched huts had changed their surname. From then on, he obtained an incurable disease waiting for the day of death to come.</p>
<p>Carrying heavy hardships, Genbao stepped into the dark prison room. No sun, no sympathy. When he was released after mixing up those blurry days, green grass had grown on his father's new grave. So he picked up the iron hoe left by his father again, stepped on the bloodstains left by his father, and lonely planted these few acres of fields that had had glorious days.</p>
<p>He meditated on re-establishing his father's glorious history from his own arms. When the three new thatched huts were built, the family killed sheep and slaughtered pigs, and the old and young people from the neighboring villages all came to congratulate them. On the square, rows of fir tables were lined up, large bowls of meat, large bowls of wine. Mothers often used this lively scene as a story to encourage their sons later. Who in Genbao's village doesn't know? Genbao thought of this glorious history, and beautiful dreams could not help but emerge again.</p>
<p>—Swallows shuttle through the willows, and peasant men sing private love songs in the fields. Genbao ate the lunch sent by his mother, and while his father was smoking a dry marriage and lying under the roots of the tree to rest, he ran to the back of the mountain to mess around with Sister Zhao. Those days, the days of suffering smoothed out</p>
<p>Genbao looked at the neighboring fields, and there was not a single man singing mountain songs. Long fragrant grass grew wildly in the spring breeze. "This is only to starve the peasants!" Gou Fu carried his luggage and didn't know where he went. The warning he left behind made the strong men in the village leave the crops and run to the wharf. Genbao threw the iron hoe beside him, and the fate he was carrying was probably approaching the tomb full of green grass!</p>
<p>The previous generation entrusted their hope to the next generation, and what is the hope of the next generation? The cuckoo bird flew over the treetops. It's time to sow! Spring is not a reading day yesterday's worthless "treasure" mistakenly "treasure owed"</p>
<h3>Spring Is Not a Reading Day</h3>
<p>Yesterday's Worthless Treasure Mistakenly Treasure Owed</p>
<h3>Little White Dove</h3>
<p>— Luo Shan</p>
<p>People who work always feel too busy, and people who wander feel too idle, so they think of ways to fill their leisure time. Two weeks ago, a friend sent me a pair of small pigeons. Their feathers were white, their tails were dotted with plum blossoms, and their eyes were exceptionally beautiful. So, the pair of little white pigeons became my companions.</p>
<p>As if driven by a god, early in the morning, around six o'clock, I got out of bed in a panic, opened the window, and slowly peeked at their sleeping faces from the air of the wire mesh, but no matter how early I got up, or how light the footsteps that even I couldn't believe, they were already jumping around there. So I opened the cage door, and they flew away with a flutter.</p>
<p>The cage was placed on the left wall of my three-story building. My house, which is not low, is directly opposite West Lake, and the North Peak is just a straight line. The Eight Characters Pagoda and Gushan are on the right side. The scenery is very beautiful, and it is even more vivid with the embellishment of a pair of small white pigeons.</p>
<p>Caring about the daily life and diet of a pair of small white pigeons, I seemed to have an unspeakable comfort, and that kind of comfort was beyond material and beyond the world.</p>
<p>(Why have I become like this?) I, who have always been annoyed by small creatures, am surprised by the sudden abnormality and often ask myself.</p>
<p>When they flew back tiredly after fluttering their light wings all day, I waited quietly at the window, and then I caught them in my hands, as if to comfort them for their hard work all day. I stroked their feathers, their shiny feathers were of course pleasing, but their warmth was beyond my expectations, and their soft and pretending-to-sleep posture suddenly revealed a natural maternal instinct. I put their eyes on my face, as if they were the only things I cared about and loved.</p>
<p>(Ha! You like them so much, wouldn't it be better if you had children?)</p>
<p>One day, when I was washing them individually, a friend couldn't stand my strange care and said carefully.</p>
<p>(Alas, if it were children, then...)</p>
<p>I swallowed it down. I don't understand why I didn't want to mention those things. Although I have already started to fantasize that if it were children, from the days when I no longer hate small creatures, I would use my whole life to care for them, irrigate them with knowledge, and create ideal great people.</p>
<p>Continuing my daily work, shaking off the bird droppings from the pigeon cage, and putting a new cotton pad underneath, I thought, the sky has been covered with haze for the past few days, and it may snow. If it snows, then this pair of small white pigeons will definitely freeze.</p>
<p>I looked at them squatting in the pigeon cage, my eyebrows were squeezed into three wrinkles, and it felt like a heavy iron block was pressing on my chest.</p>
<h3>Paper Kite</h3>
<p>— Laborious Heart</p>
<p>Spring has come, and a layer of joy floats in my heart. How should I welcome this spring? Although this spring is not for us.</p>
<p>In my past, full of old traces, I can find examples of how to welcome it, but among these examples, I can never find a good and interesting method, because my past is so ordinary. If I must find one, then I can only say with embarrassment: a paper kite.</p>
<p>Indeed, the paper kite was once my good friend. I remember when I was a five or six-year-old child, a very naughty cattle herder in the countryside. Although life wasn't very good, as a child, as long as there was freedom and friends to play with, I didn't care about anything else. In spring, such a good season, we naughty little comrades were very happy to fly kites. However, our countryside was very remote, and kites were not easy to buy and were very expensive. Therefore, once I didn't succeed in buying a kite, I sulked and didn't eat for a day.</p>
<p>Flying a kite always requires someone's help. I would ask a friend to hold the kite and stand in a high place to lift it up, and then I would hold the string tightly, pulling it with force. If the wind was strong, it would quickly fly high. Sometimes, if the wind was a little calmer, I would stand on the back of an ox to fly it; sometimes, I would even climb onto the roof. When the kite somersaults in the air like a hungry eagle, it can be considered wonderful, but to do this, one must have the skill: those without skill can only watch it fall from high up.</p>
<p>Chinese people like to fight. They can think of ways to fight with anything, and kites are naturally no exception. Therefore, if we accidentally discovered a kite different from our own, we would mobilize our kites very quickly, like discovering an enemy plane during wartime, and surround the enemy until we cut the enemy plane's string with our own string; sometimes, others would cut our kite's string, which would depend on your experience and courage to fight back. I used to enjoy playing this very much because it also required thinking and skill, and it was a more interesting game.</p>
<p>The fleeting past has passed, and now I am drifting into this big city. These pasts can only become historical relics. If we really want to see kite flying, we can only find it in the essays in newspapers and magazines, or see the kite movement promoted by adults and gentlemen to save the country. A few years ago, I saw a poem that described the spring season: "The kite hangs on the power line." This is undoubtedly a good description, but if the author lives in Shanghai, it would be a bit comical. I have never seen a kite flying in the sky in Shanghai.</p>
<p>One day, I accidentally encountered a five or six-year-old child flying a kite on the road. I felt a little happy in my heart: my ideal is not necessarily correct, there are also children flying kites in big cities. But when I saw the child's pitiful appearance of flying a kite, I couldn't help but feel disappointed, because he was so stupid. On a road covered with coal smoke and ash, a half-broken kite was flying on the small string he was pulling, perhaps not even able to fly over an adult's head. Such flying is useless; I almost wanted to help him make his kite fly higher. But undoubtedly, this is also an ideal. No matter how skilled you are, you cannot make a broken kite fly into the sky in such a flat, crowded place. ...</p>
<p>Ah—I was frightened. The little child, the little child flying the kite, was knocked down by a car. Crying on the ground.</p>
<p>Spring may not come to our domain, perhaps.</p>
<h3>Spring Rain</h3>
<p>— Chen Liang</p>
<p>Opening that dark green window curtain didn't reveal a morning illuminated by cheerful and warm sunlight as usual, but rather, a gloomy day that made everyone who saw it feel uncomfortable.</p>
<p>"It's going to rain, the sky never wants to give people a few more refreshing days!"</p>
<p>With unkempt hair and arms wrapped tightly around her purple-red pajamas, she lay down on the sofa, her face as gloomy as the weather, not wanting to laugh but also not wanting to cry. She had lived through yesterday, and she was thinking about today... today?</p>
<p>But, on the half of the bed, there was someone sleeping on their side, face outward, with half a "White Gold Dragon" cigarette stuck to their lips, a young man calling her name—continuously; "Cai'e... Cai'e..."</p>
<p>It really started to rain, tapping on the glass window, continuous—spring rain.</p>
<p>She didn't reply, only using her right hand to hit her own head. Who is calling this name? For the sake of life, even her age and name must be hidden from people, why? I am deceiving people all my life to survive in the world, why can't I say my real surname and age? She was so angry that she really wanted to cry sadly, but it was absolutely impossible. Tears should be swallowed into her stomach. In this position, she only has the duty to laugh, not the right to cry. She turned over and fell into the abyss of bottomless sorrow.</p>
<p>"Do you have a headache?" the young man lying on the bed asked, with a hint of strange light in his eyes.</p>
<p>"Thank you, this kind of false affection, this kind of hypocritical, insincere concern. You didn't come for love, you came for lust. Don't say headache, even if I suddenly die today, you would still go your way—" she thought. She deliberately ignored him. She understood her own situation and position better than anyone else, but she couldn't directly point out the hypocrisy of a man who would give her some life source under certain conditions.</p>
<p>The rain outside the window was getting heavier and heavier, "Hua Hua Hua Hua," like it would never stop. Several parallel power lines were also endlessly shedding tears into the window. Each raindrop hit the glass windowpane, also hitting</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>hitting her tender heart, arousing stars of old creation hidden pain, slowly spreading and elusive - nerve pain.</p>
<p>The young man got out of bed and came over, using his rough hands to twist her head, like a plaster bust displayed in an art academy, not wanting to laugh or cry.</p>
<p>"Swallow a few aspirin."</p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>"Don't you have headaches!"</p>
<p>But she laughed, "Illness! Do you understand my illness? Can aspirin cure my illness?" Such a loud voice sprayed out from her purple-red lips. She reached out and brushed aside the messy hair hanging in front of her eyes, and ran to the window in one breath. Rain and wind were attacking her through a thin piece of glass. She looked at the city streets below through the misty air, still rushing back and forth, with busy pedestrians and streetcars appearing at every moment.</p>

<p>Duke Mu of Song Establishes Duke Shang</p>
<p>Those who have a country pass it on to their sons, which is the common way. It is also the middle way. Duke Xuan of Song must pass it on to his brother, thinking that it is high. Passing it on to Duke Mu once and making him chase away his son. Passing it on to Duke Shang again and making him kill himself. Gongyang Shi believed that the gentleman greatly resided in the disaster of Zheng Song. Duke Xuan did it. His theory is nothing to add. I have tried to push Duke Xuan's intention. Must think that the sage builds the country. Those who make fathers and sons succeed each other are for the crowd. What kind of person is Yao? He did not pass it on to his son but passed it on to Shun. What kind of person is Shun? He did not pass it on to his son but passed it on to Yu. Why do I treat myself as the multitude?

<p>Therefore, the gentleman does everything to the utmost. Renovating oneself and the people, all want to stop at the highest good. (Right Transmission of the Second Chapter, Explaining the New People) The poem says, the territory of the country is a thousand miles, the people live there. (Poetry, Shang Ode Xuan Bird's chapter. State base, the capital of the king. Stop, live; words things each have their proper place.) The poem says, the warbling yellow bird, stops in the corner of the hill. The Master said, knowing where to stop, can one not be as good as a bird. (The warbling poem is made into wailing. Poem, Small Ode Wailing chapter, warbling, bird sound. Hill corner, dense place. The Master said the following, Confucius's words about poetry; words people should know where to stop.) The poem says, solemn King Wen, on continuing brightly, respectfully stopping being a ruler, stopping in benevolence; being a subject; stopping in respect; being a son, stopping in filial piety; being a father, stopping in kindness; interacting with the people of the country, stopping in good faith. (On continuing, the sound of the black bird. Poetry, Wen Wang's chapter. Solemn, meaning far-reaching. On, exclamatory word. Continue, continue. Bright, bright. Respectfully stop, speak of his nothing but respect, and rest where he stops; quoted here to say the saint's stop, nothing but the highest good, five are the largest of its goals, scholars in this, explore its subtle implications, and then extrapolate to exhaust the rest, then in the world's affairs, all have to know where to stop without doubt.)</p>

<h3>A Brief History of Film Development (11)</h3>
<p>— Wen Ying</p>
<p>(11) The Completion of Techniques in the Silent Era</p>
<p>In (The Big Parade), directed by King Vidor, there is a scene where the male and female leads chew gum. The humor of that scene is something that anyone who has seen it will not forget. But how was it filmed? It's quite laughable to say. According to the original script, there was no scene of chewing gum. The male and female leads were just supposed to meet very simply. The male lead at that time was John Gilbert, and the female lead was French star Renee Adoree (her early death was also a great loss to the film industry).</p>
<p>Renee was on the set, waiting to start filming, when she was chewing gum in a relaxed manner. She accidentally said a sentence, saying that the country people in France had not seen this thing before the European War. After the end of the European War, when American soldiers went to France, this thing also became popular in France. King Vidor heard these words and shouted, "Great. John, give Renee a piece of gum to eat. Teach her how to eat it. She doesn't understand your language. You don't understand his language either. You use gestures to perform."</p>
<p>They had not even rehearsed it. Renee and John were neither prepared nor did they know what to do after eating the gum. The camera slowly shook. The photographer looked at the director's face, quietly waiting for him to shout "Cut". The director was looking at the male lead eating gum, and not shouting "Cut", which made the photographer wonder, eating some gum also required so much film, I don't know that King Vidor had different eyes, and what he saw was different from others. By the time that scene was filmed, it had become the longest single scene in all films ever. This can also be said to be a major reform in photography and directing techniques.</p>
<p>When the film was finished editing, the scene of eating gum was able to maintain its original perfection. After it was released to the public, the audience, after seeing the entire film, was most moved by that scene. The production cost of this small "program production" was less than $200,000, but after it was released, the box office revenue in New York alone exceeded $800,000. The success of this war film is conceivable, and the audience, after being tired of war, was able to uniquely welcome (The Big Parade), which also shows the fickleness of psychology, and the skill of a good director in manipulating people's hearts.</p>
<p>We don't need to lament the past glory. But the progress of Hollywood is extremely fast. Hollywood is a vivid, lively, young, and lovely thing, but all its vitality comes from the money that is produced from the blood of youth and abundance. Money, money, money is the blood of Hollywood, the source of life. Among the films with the largest investment in the silent era mentioned earlier, "Ben-Hur" was the first. In addition to money, the effort put into it by the people involved was also considerable. But that film is still an indelible masterpiece in history. The other few, such as "Beau Geste", "The Covered Wagon", "Phantom of The Opera", "Robin Hood", etc., must still be reverberating in your minds.</p>
<p>The advancement of film is extremely rapid, but the road it has traveled is not a smooth road. How many times has it almost been destroyed, but it has been able to turn danger into safety and turn misfortune into good fortune. Now everyone is making a "clean-up movement", which makes the film industry feel extremely uneasy, but the first patent war almost killed it. At the same time, it suffered a blow from "censorship", which almost made it slump. The film industry figures at that time were not without places where their actions were out of line, but they were able to rein in their horses at the edge of the cliff and turn back in time. They promised to abide by the rules in the future, and elected Will Hayes as Hollywood's moral inspector, which allowed them to safely overcome the difficulties and reach their current position.</p>
<p>When you look back, don't laugh at the simplicity and boredom of those silent films, because the best of them have already reached perfection in terms of technique. In the past thirty years, the development from "moving peep shows" to the technically perfect film industry is an amazing progress. Money has also become abundant, and it can hire great directors, first-class writers, and famous actors. It has reached a point where nothing is impossible. It has reached the peak of art. But, after a person reaches the highest peak, where else can he go? Just like thirty years ago, the audience was bored with simple moving films and had to add the editing of character stories, they now feel the same boredom. Film companies are gradually losing money. The audience in movie theaters is gradually thinning out. Could it be that after the completion of film techniques, it has reached the end of the road? (To be continued)</p>

<p>Film Review</p>
<h3>Review of "Resurrection"</h3>
<p>— Ling He, You Jing</p>
<p>We Life Again—Nanjing Screening</p>
<p>1. Leo Tolstoy</p>
<p>Regarding Leo Tolstoy (1828–1910), the great Russian, and indeed global, artist, we cannot possibly write a sufficient biography within these brief pages. To gain a deeper understanding of the literary masterpiece "Resurrection," Tolstoy's artistic and religious views—representing the most vivid expression of so-called "Tolstoyan" thought—we will briefly examine his artistic theories and religious views within the context of his life.</p>
<p>Leo Tolstoy, like his contemporary, the other great writer Ivan Turgenev, was born into nobility and, through contact with real life, developed a deep dissatisfaction with his own class. After graduating from Kazan University, Tolstoy stayed with his older brother, a staff officer, in the Caucasus and soon took up a similar position himself. In contact with many soldiers, he became heavily influenced by the habits of young officers at the time and unwittingly fell into a life of drinking, gambling, and pleasure-seeking. This period of decline, one might say, later provided him with profound material for repentance in a completely different attitude toward life. In 1855, he participated in the Crimean War, witnessed all the horrors of the battlefield, and came to understand the nature of war at that time. This became the foundation for his later anti-militarism and thoroughgoing advocacy of pacifism. After the war, he roamed through England, France, and Germany, and combined with his observations after returning home, he had a deep and painful understanding of the darkness and ugliness of the so-called civilized world. A few years after his marriage, he cooled towards his already fruitful writing career and, as an enthusiast and practitioner of religious and social reform activities, threw a huge bomb at the civilization of the time. However, because of the dualism of the metaphysics from which he departed, and the return to and development of original Christian education, this bomb of his was not as powerful as he had thought.</p>
<p>You are poor, precisely because you are rich,</p>
<p>You are strong-willed, precisely because you are weak,</p>
<p>Mother Russia!</p>
<p>Tolstoy sang thus. On the one hand, Tolstoy was not only a genius artist who provided the world literary scene with excellent depictions of the real life of the Russian people, but also a fanatical Christian landowner. On the other hand, he was a relentless, strong, direct, and sincere opponent of social hypocrisy and deceit, yet as a Tolstoyan religious follower, he told the masses that although he himself was ugly, he was an intellectual engaged in the moral self-completion, a debilitated and mentally ill weakling. He mercilessly criticized the exploitative systems of the time, the autocracy of the Tsarist government, and even more deeply dissected the contradictions of society, but at the same time fanatically preached "non-resistance to evil" through violence. His contradictions in views and doctrines were not accidental but were a manifestation of the contradictory conditions in Russian life during the 1830s. Therefore, it is not enough to observe and evaluate Tolstoy's views solely from the perspective of the modern labor movement and scientific socialism; one should evaluate them from the perspective of the emerging capitalism, the impoverishment of the masses, and the loss of land, which inevitably gave rise to resistance from the autocratic countryside. Tolstoy was a great expression of the thoughts and spirits of millions of peasants at the time of the coming Russian bourgeois revolution.</p>
<p>2. "Resurrection"</p>
<p>The novel "Resurrection" is artistically inferior to "War and Peace," "Anna Karenina," and other short stories in Tolstoy's oeuvre. However, it is a masterpiece of Tolstoy's later years, the most concrete and explicit crystallization of his artistic and religious views, and the most cosmopolitan of the author's novels.</p>
<p>In "Resurrection," Tolstoy wove together the problems he encountered, the nodes of society at that time, the focus of darkness, and especially the attention to the issue of "land and freedom," and provided a solution through his religious views, under the guise of a love story. Especially in the second half, he played himself as Dmitry, repenting from his fallen sin and converting to religious anarchism, personally solving the problems of the masses he saw. This was originally a very ridiculous thing. But in Tolstoy's sincere, passionate, and tragic artistry, he cleverly achieved the effect he intended. This is what we must emphatically point out among those who unconditionally worship everything Tolstoy did.</p>
<p>3. "Resurrection" on the Screen</p>
<p>I remember we once saw "Nana," produced by Sam Goldwyn and starring Anna Sten. At the same time, we will not forget that Émile Zola's "Nana" was transformed under Goldwyn's production. That is to say, the Nana of the novel did not appear on the screen as she originally was, but Goldwyn's Nana appeared completely through the colored lenses of a businessman. Therefore, the loss in value of "Nana" caused considerable dissatisfaction among the audience. Now, Tolstoy's "Resurrection" has been brought to the screen under Goldwyn's wishful thinking, and like "Nana," it has changed the original face of the original novel.</p>
<p>To illustrate this point, we can cite the following proofs.</p>
<p>"Resurrection" became Tolstoy's representative work, and a world-renowned masterpiece, precisely because the last part had the development of Tolstoyism. Therefore, the male protagonist ultimately sacrificed himself to complete the love of Katusha Maslova and Simonson. Prince Dmitry single-handedly engaged in social undertakings. The so-called mechanical translation of the original Christian meaning "Matthew 5:39", kneeling before the icon, attempting to find a solution to social problems in the Bible.</p>
<p>It is in this place that the most central development of Tolstoyism lies, and the keynote for evaluating "Resurrection." At the same time, sacrificing one's own love for the sake of love is also expressed as Tolstoy's view of love. However, under Goldwyn's production, this focus was completely ignored, and the male and female protagonists were combined in a Happy Ending, distorting the marriage of Katusha and political prisoner Simonson in the original work, and distorting the spirit of Dmitry seeking a solution to social problems. Of course, we cannot have too high an evaluation of Tolstoyism at the current stage, so progressive filmmakers can boldly correct this error, but the playwrights have completely accepted the original religious art proposition, only removing the essence of the original work in the end, and then changed the original name Resurrection to (We Life Again), which is actually a vulgar (We Love Again).</p>
<p>Here, it is fully explained that the playwrights, under Goldwyn's instructions, did not have a good understanding of the original work, and further demonstrated technical flaws in other scenes. Most importantly, we must point out that when Katusha went to the train station to find Dmitry, in the silent film "Resurrection" (starring Dolores del Río), that was the most emotional scene, which made the audience cry bitterly. But in this film, it is so ordinary, not only does it rain for no reason as in the flower shed, but mainly it fails to create the climax effect of the tragedy. At the same time, before losing herself in the flower shed, Dmitry said that he would take her for a walk on a beautiful summer night, so the rain came too suddenly. What also needs to be pointed out is that because the time passed was explained by the subtitle "Seven Years Later", the process of the heroine becoming a prostitute and accidentally killing someone was not a pictorial expression but a dialogue explanation, so the audience did not have a clear understanding of the change in the personality of the character Katusha, but this was also the success of the silent film.</p>
<p>However, this film exaggerated the religious scenes as much as possible, as a positive reception to the original religious art sermon. At the same time, these places were quite successful technically due to Rouben Mamoulian's skilled directing techniques and the excellent performances of Fredric March and Anna Sten.</p>
<p>What should be mentioned in particular is that Mamoulian, after "Applause" and "Queen Christina," demonstrated his directing skills here. Within the scope stipulated by the script, he succeeded as an excellent technician no matter what. Naturally, we cannot fail to point out that the train station and other scenes showed errors in weaving techniques, thus losing the tragic emotion. However, his guidance on acting, or the handling of individual scenes, was very skillful. In particular, the cruel depiction of prisoner life, its power to stimulate the audience, was extremely successful in terms of film art. It is worthy of being a great literary work.</p>
<p>4. Conclusion</p>
<p>The fact that "Resurrection" has been brought to the screen many times shows how film merchants are exploiting world-famous works. However, when they distort the original work, they fully demonstrate the vulgarity of the merchant's attitude. The highest effect of tragedy has not been achieved here, although we have been greatly satisfied in terms of individual skills. However, soft gentlemen often juxtapose artistic value and political value, so if they do not deny that Tolstoy is an artist, how would they explain the sermon in "Resurrection"?</p>
<p>Anna Sten and Fredric March, the two leading actors of "Resurrection," performed in the immortal masterpiece of the great Russian writer Tolstoy</p>
<h3>Anti-Imperialist Film "Beauty's Heart"</h3>
<p>"Beauty's Heart," which has been in production for more than a year, has finally been completed recently.</p>
<p>"Beauty's Heart" is Xu Xinfu's powerful work following "Salt Tide." Its story depicts the daughter of a famous scholar who falls in love with a Northeast volunteer soldier. Engaged in constant warfare. Love threads cannot hold back ambition, and finally the volunteer soldier dies in battle on the battlefield. Amidst the emotions of sorrow and hatred, many other national heroes still proceed very seriously.</p>
<p>At a time when "high-ranking women do not know the hatred of national subjugation and still sing the Backyard Flower across the river," this anti-imperialist film is undoubtedly of great significance. It is a stimulant for the declining national spirit and those who are drunk and dreaming of death, making the audience want to cry but have no tears, and want to laugh but have no voice.</p>
<p>In terms of directing techniques, it is more perfect than "Salt Tide." Of course, the significance is also more serious than "Salt Tide." Coupled with many magnificent sets and delicate and profound expressions, it will be unexpectedly successful.</p>
<p>Starring Hu Die, Wang Zhengxin, Gu Meijun, Lan Jun, Xu Xin, etc. (However)</p>
