<p>我國自白銀出口徵稅以後。通貨膨脹之說。時爲街頭巷尾之談資。逮乎最近。中華工業總聯會特設一經濟專門委員會。研究通貨膨脹之施行方案。以救濟今日之恐慌。一俟議有具體。再向政府條陳。由是而觀。此說已成爲實業團體討論之中心。其討論之結果。是否卽爲異日政府採擇之政策。在目前雖尙未可以臆測。但其自動研究之精神。殊足令人欽佩也。</p>
<p>然而如欲以通貨膨脹求中國經濟恐慌之解脫。則吾人對於恐慌之原因。竊有未能已於言者。中國今日之工商恐慌。以其爆發之時期論。乃在於金融恐慌之前。農業恐慌之後。由此正足見今日商業之所以蕭條。民族工業之所以衰敝。其前因乃在於農村之破產。國民大部分購買力之消失。又加之以國外廉價商品。滾滾輸入。使中國之市塲。趨於隘狹。而隘狹市塲之大部分。又爲洋貨所充斥。換言之。今日中國所殘餘之購買力。多爲洋貨所刦奪而去。在此種情形之下。中國工商之爆發危機。正有其由來也。至於金融資本與產業資本之分離。乃爲促進工商恐慌之稈度。而决非爆發工商恐慌之基因。故欲求工商恐慌之解脫。自非先自農村改善入手不爲功。</p>
<p>至於通貨之膨脹。無論在理論或事實上言。自可提高物價。是以今日認工商之恐慌不安。由於市塲金融籌碼不敷周轉所致者。多認膨脹通貨。爲唯一解脫工商恐慌之途徑。此說也在白銀源源流出。市塲通貨收縮。籌碼不足之今日。固可以言之成理。然而將何以解過去銀賤金貴時之恐慌。蓋籌碼不足。不過爲目前一時之現象。並非中國恐慌之根本原因。中國恐慌之根因。乃爲國民大部分購買力之消失。而所謂購買力之消失者。其意非爲通貨數量之不足。而爲通貨之不能入手。因此。若購買力不能設法使其恢復。則縱令將來膨脹十百倍於今日之通貨。其結果。不過徒增貨幣之數量。减低貨幣之價値而已。誠然。通貨數量增加。物價可以騰貴。全國大部分之農民。可因農產物之漲價而多獲得貨幣。然在另一方面。農民豈非仍以一般物價上騰而多支出貨幣耶。入多出多。則未來之購買力。又豈有異於今日之購買力乎。</p>
<p>故在今日而言解脫經濟恐慌。其最根本之方法。在求如何能使中國大部分之農民。成爲「入超於出」。而此「入超於出」之部分。更應求其不爲外國商品所攫去。更應求其能增進農民之購買力。比一根本問題如能救濟。則一切恐慌皆可解脫。設若治標而不兼治本。將來難免不一波未平。一波又起。殊非一勞永逸之道也。通貨膨脹之政策。往往「開塲容易收塲難」。若不經通盤之籌劃。縝密之考慮。則其實行也。不獨爲效甚尠。或且使社會國家交受其困。退一步言之。卽使行之而無弊。亦决非救濟恐慌之根本辦法。此亦國人之所不可不察者也。</p>
<p>總之。凡事須看得淸。認得眞。脚踏實地。勇往邁進。以言經濟組織。其必須澈底改造者。便應澈底改造。若可以部分改善者。則不妨部分改善。本「大無畏」之精神。以極「科學」之態度。一手執解剖刀。一手執縫皮針。應割便割。應補便補。夫然後恐慌之病根。方有抜除之希望與可能也。</p>

<p>初、馬攻破達板城時、曾遣指揮陳淸浴、北路總指揮馬玉良、團長馬占祿等、先後進攻孚遠、均以失敗而退、馬聞之不悅、以孚遠孤懸天山之麓、城小如斗、何致不能攻克、遂親率騎兵二千數百人、於十一月十二日夜、開抵孚屬南區之泉子街、至五更時、集衆授以攻城方略、且言同到濟木薩（孚遠）城中吃早飯、是早天微雪、遍地皆白、馬令兵士、翻服白裘與雪色相映爲一、以混守城兵民之辨視、時已黎明、守城者因甚疲倦、不知敵臨城下、竟由北城架梯而上、該處守城戶民某少年者方持矛依雉堞而朦朧、幸驚覺、猛刺登垜之敵、使跌城下、餘見城中有備、遂以排槍齊發、機槍掃射、迫擊砲、手溜彈、亦紛紛擲入城上、聲如萬山崩倒、駭不可聞、守城兵民、奮力以石擲擊、並以劈山長龍等各種火槍、連環應戰、敵奮死猛撲、終不得逞、但城上女墻、多被蕩平、守城兵民、無所屏蔽、乃急於城上、挖掘戰壕、伏而還擊、迄午戰稍停、馬脅迫鄕民、赴城下送書、略謂「攻孚乃軍事上重要策略、志在必得、如不早降、則殺入城內、鷄犬不留」云云、時城中始知攻城者、爲作亂多年屠殺甘新兩省數十萬生靈之馬伸英也、城中守兵、僅數百人、快槍二百枝、且子彈甚缺乏、城之四面及四角、分配佈防、每處快槍、不過二十餘枝、其餘兵民、皆持火槍、刀矛、及棍棒之類、各守一垜、不許紛動、雖傷亡達百數十人、而竟無一畏懼退縮者、城垜之被毁缺者、以毛綑毛毡、或袋實沙土、隨時堵之、入夜恐敵梯城、不易察覺、以久浸洋油之新磚、燃懸於城垜外、遂長明如畫、然磚易爲彈碎、後改用厚麻布、其效力益著、敵屢於夜間、以雲梯大舉撲城、故城上得用長龍實火藥、碎鍋片爲子彈、從容射發、命中敵人、某夜戰停、守城軍民、見城壕棄擲槍彈甚多、使兵士縋城、取得敵屍所帶之手槍七十餘枝、子彈三萬餘粒、分發守衆、氣勢倍壯、一日天色未明、東北城外、隱約見一巨物、髙懸空際、審視之、乃敵架設之毛綑也、緣孚邑城隍廟、在東北城角之外、其戲樓高出城墻數丈、據其樓巔、可俯瞰城中、敵乘夜用毛綑架墩於上、伏向城中射擊、居高臨下、莫之能敵、城上兵民、立卽掘壕藏身、又將北城鎭武樓頂、挖取一窓、窓外四圍、壘以土坏、使其高與城隍廟戲樓上之毛墩相埓、並特選槍手、更番向高墩射擊、馬見高墩失恃、又出掘洞以攻之計、城中偵獲其情、恐地洞掘成、敵將掩入、卽令凡城墻與敵挖洞密邇之處、先沿城根挖暗溝以迎之、溝形腹大、低可容人、口小令能納音、內置磁罎一具、上覆銅鑼、令人時刻聽之、如在外有挖洞情事、雖十里可聽也、一日忽聞罎鑼鏗鏘有聲、知敵洞已近、卽以聽得方向、召壯丁日夜迎掘、及相通後、用水灌之、使洞中敵不能立足、即埋地雷亦必致火藥浸濕、難於爆發、計敵洞縱橫六七道、被接通灌水者三四道、至十七日天未明時、東甕城洞下、又被守軍截掘一洞、距不遠矣、忽聞敵洞有置藥箱聲甚晰、守洞軍營長趙某與團長尤某、先後入洞視察、並運水四十桶於洞口、此時如將水灌入、則火藥必全爲水淹矣、尤日「盍速出洞灌水」、趙曰「尙早」、正在相商之際、轟然一聲、烟塵閉目、如天地之崩覆、則敵之地雷、已爆發矣、城之門扇、倒入門洞、而尤趙及兵民數人、俱已被埋洞中、尤力頂覆土而出、急於敵彈下、滾逃入城、趙亦隨之脫險、餘則壓死洞中、</p>
<p>當地雷爆發時、東門轟開、馬隊悍猛、欲搶入城、城中卽運砂袋、且壘且戰、敵仍不得逞、此時有最奇險之一事、卽敵猛撲東門時、東城內墻下、挖洞之一民人、因行赴東北城角大便、甫止步間、恍見城墻下、現有一洞、大如碗口、微聞內有物響聲、驚呼日、「此中有賊」、忽孔內砰然發槍、比人手無寸鐵、他兵聞呼、由城躍下、向孔內連發數槍、敵遂鼠竄而去、後取鐵器掘之、洞大可容五人、再以辣椒菸葉等物、燃諸洞口、復用風箱扇之、藏敵由城外出、且高呼曰、「大烟鬼、（回人多以此呼罵漢人）、請勿費心了、我們原是不會吃烟的、」某君料城門上所駢列之方木、若敵潑石油以燃之、則城樓不保、而防守亦殆矣、乃計由木上鐜兩孔、由孔灌士實洞、可不虞被火、但城中丁壯、全在城上扼守、城門洞大、需土甚多、正苦運土乏人、忽見羣兒嬉戲、有一二重爲之長、衆皆聽命、遂以童召童、不旋踵間、羣兒畢集、應命運土、多至三四百人、縣長戒之日、「行勿過速、速則疲矣、負勿過多、多則覆矣、」諸兒聞言、反相競爭、行愈速而負亦更多、自巳至申、洞土滿矣、午後天霧蔽空、陰風颯颯、人皆談虎色變、到處覺有掘洞聲、蓋以人心戒懼過甚、慮敵復以地洞攻我、以幻爲眞也、如是相持至二十一日午、迪化援軍至、城圍始解、馬潰敗率殘部千餘人、向達坂城而逃、傷亡逾千、子彈亦耗三十萬發以上、城中因防守周密、人心團結、卒獲無事、然死傷之數、亦達三百數十人矣、（當抗戰方酣之某夜間、乍將敵洞截通、二小時內竟灌水三百餘担、此時男丁皆在城上、守垜應戰、運水者皆爲婦女、往來絡繹、奔馳甚速、且運且言曰、「快灌洞吧、勿使敵進、進則鷄犬不留矣、」以故奏功甚速、事後省府據縣長報吿、來電褒獎曰、「婦女協防、兒童奮鬥、該縣長調度有方、與民效死弗去、殊堪嘉獎」云云、所謂該縣長者、卽現任哈密區行政長劉應麟也、孚遠之役、在盛馬戰爭中、尙屬小焉者、然猶畫攻夜襲、砲火連天、死傷枕藉、劇烈如此、若南山·紫泥泉·省城圍攻·南疆追擊等役、戰事之烈、較此殆將十百倍、苟一一詳加記述、不知更將如何令人毛骨悚然也、（未完）</p>

<h3>時人行踪録</h3>
<p>賀耀組昨晚乘夜快車晉京、</p>
<h3>各種運銷合作社組織方式</h3>
<p>（再續）　史蒂芬氏演講</p>
<p>有人主張謂農人能力淺陋、故集中式是較聯合式爲適合、因集中式祗須經理得人、進行定可順利、誠然、如有優良領袖、集中式確可採行、惟所困難者、即領袖問題也、且選擇領袖時、亦有應特別注意者、倘爲集中式合作社之領袖時、則祇憑一次之判斷、而乏事實根據、所選者不幸而遭失敗、則其影響及於全部之合作社、倘爲聯合式之領袖、則其影響祗限於一分社、當此領袖辦理分社時、成績不良、則被舉爲聯合社之領袖機會甚少、即使誤舉爲聯合社之職員、而聯合社所理之事、僅限於運銷之一部份工作而已、其危害於合作社甚徵也、聯合社之領袖、已先在分社、有良好成績者、始有被舉至聯合社之機會、故聯合社易得有經騐之領袖、而集中式則不能必其然也、總之如有優良領袖、則集中式實可較聯合式進步迅速、然集中式經理之意見、不能代表多數人之意見也、</p>
<p>運銷合作社之辦法、頗不一致、其業務之簡單者、如羊毛運銷合作社等、不必如其他各社之有二層組織、再如雞蛋及雞隻運銷合作社、農民以養雞爲其副業、祇需用汽車駛往各地、收集產品、無需大規模之設備、則不必有上述之複雜組織、在美國之維基尼亞、（Virginja）有一蔬菜合作社、鄰近城市、當地交通極便、有鐵道貫其間、其組織爲集中式、經理頗有經騐、故雖爲集中式之合作社、成績甚佳、其組織之情形、除總辦事處外、尙有辦事分處若干、略具設備、統由總經理管轄、此社因管理得人、始有如此成績、否則其結果殊難預測、更因交通便利、社員參與大會、往返頗便、此皆成功之大原因、否則恐力難勝任也、故依據以往之情形、對些種方式、孰優孰劣、未能遽加斷論、總之於不得已時、始能採行集中式、且應詳細審查其弱點之所在、於可能範圍以內、仍以聯合式爲較妥也、</p>
<p>E終點市塲運銷合作社、此種合作社、得聯合在各大城市設立終點市塲合作代銷處、專事經營各分社運來之產品、所得之欵、除略收手續費外、其餘悉數滙交運貨之合作社、茲以牲畜爲例、當牲畜運出時、販牲畜之商人、不能親至當地販買、故地方合作社、須設法將其運上車輛加以記號、以資識別、故此項合作社、無需設備、祇須事先决定運裝之日期、再通知各社員、按時各將牲畜裝運上車即可、牲畜不如其他貨物之易於分等、故運裝時、須有詳細記錄、免致混亂也、</p>
<p>終點市塲合作代銷處之經營運銷、比較經濟而適宜、蓋代銷處營業之所在、均位於城市交易中心、故銷售極易、且辦事人員、對於當地運銷情形、比較熟悉、不致受愚、缺乏經騐之指導員、或易主張、將終點市塲亦取聯合社之組織者、惟此種情形、須加考慮、因各地市塲、銷售暢滯、時有不同、故原產區須按各市塲之市况以决定其銷售地點、彼此距離遠近不一、固定屬於一終點市塲、事實上不完全適宜、蓋同時可以加入數個終點市塲、惟原則上合作社加入某一終點市塲、對該市塲始有權利義務之責、而對於其他終點市塲、似無利害關係、欲其祖負同等責任、似不公允、勉强聯合、必無成績之可言也、</p>

<h3>中日經濟提携之商榷　（三續）</h3>
<p>— 穆藕初</p>
<p>輸入减少部分糧雜及麵粉一六二，七九六，二八三元。肥皂脂肪等五九，〇一八，二六五元。棉布品（棉紗除外）三四，四七三，九八一元。其他五金一九，六六三，一一五元。煤及燃料一一，二九七，六四一元。化學及藥品九，七四一，九六七元。糖九，五六二，四七一元。棉花八，七一一，〇四三元。絲及絲織品六，二一二，五九〇元。書籍，地圖，紙張等六，三二七，八六三元。</p>
<p>上列數宇，因經濟恐慌及其他各種關係，自難作單純的判斷，不過從輸入增加部分，最多者爲機器等類，則可知中國正在急需生產手段的商品。减少部分，雖有很多複雜關係，但如棉布，紙張等的减少，不能不說係一部分爲國產工業品所代替。由此更可證明中國的輕工業正在發展，國產工業正在抬頭，然而道裏就發生一個問題了，就是國產工業正在發展的時侯，如果放任日貨。在中國市塲上横行，那末中國國產工業將遭遇什麼困難呢？我們再看日貨輸入我國是什麼商品。（未完）</p>

<h3>藝術的幻想</h3>
<p>— 立波</p>
<p>差不多一切浪漫主義的作品，尤其是詩歌，都是建築在放蕩不覊的幻想上，誇大的綫，濃厚的色彩，瑰奇的情節和那使人遐想的「金色的夢」，這一切浪漫諦克的質素，都不是自然和人間的現存的東西，都是創造的主體的幻想的產品。</p>
<p>環繞着浪漫主義者的周圍世界，常常是充滿了醜惡和平凡，一切作爲藝術的原料的境過和事物，差不多總是無價値，無色澤的雜質的堆積，在這表面，看不出任何藝術美，更沒有人類的夢；只有經過創造底提煉和誇大，才能成爲包含着這一切的浪漫的產品，如果把這產品當作藝術的溶液，把創造的主體當作镕爐，那末幻想就是這鎔爐的主耍的炭火。</p>
<p>但是，藝術的幻想决不只是對於浪漫主義如此重要，就是在極端的一自然主義」和嚴格的現實主義的創造活動中也演着最重要的角色。主張用文件上的忠實來處理現實的「自然主義」大師左拉也說過他的所謂現實是「以感情的三稜鏡所窺見的現實。」通過這三稜鏡所見的多芒的，輝煌的東西不是等於我們的幻想的一部分嗎？</p>
<p>幻想常常使自然現象和人類生活，反映到人的腦裏，成爲此實際的存在更鮮明，更尖利的東西，這一點，在詩和漫畫上，表現得更加明白。</p>
<p>在現實主義的範圍中，常常地，因爲有了幻想，我們可以更堅固地把握現實，更有力地影饗現實。不理解這一點，對於許多偉大寫實主義者的奇幻的構想—如哥郭爾的常常出的鬼怪等—是不能解釋的。</p>
<p>也許有人要說，進步的現實主義不靠幻想。這意見，是很機械的，一切進步的現實主義者的血管裏，常常有浪漫主義的成分，因此，也離不了幻想。實際上，沒有幻想的成分的現實主義决不能滿足新的社會層的需要。高爾基鄭重地吿訴我們：「在言語的創造的藝術上，在作出種種性格和典型的藝術上，想像和直觀，「幻想」是必要的。」烏拉基密爾更强力地主張「夢想的權利」的確保。</p>
<p>進步的現實主義者不但要表現現實，把握現實，最要緊的是要提高現實；要使「我們的關於人類和生活的認識深化，擴大」。要「補足那尙未發見的事實的運鎖之鐶」。沒有豐富的想像力乃至幻想，這一切都沒有可能的。在這意味上，可以應用那句名言：「不能做夢的實行家，是壞的實行家。」</p>
<p>當然，我們要把幻想的兩種不同的作用，分別淸楚，在退步的浪漫主義中，幻想對於現實常常有一種「病態的逃避」作用，牠總是麻痺和腐敗生活力的有毒的東西，但在進步的浪漫主義乃至現實主義當中，幻想始終保持着現實的基調，不但發揮着照耀現實，充實現實的充分作用，而且提供着燦爛的實踐底理想。</p>
<p>但是，幻想有時是要和現實矛盾的，幻想要引人走到「矇朧的遠方」去，甚至於要引人走上「空中樓閣」去，這里，不是要毒害了現實嗎？關於這問題，皮沙雷夫說得最好：</p>
<p>「夢想和現實的矛盾，假如夢想的人一方面眞正地相信自己的夢想，注意深深地凝視着現實，一方面把對於現實的自己的觀察和自己的空中樓閣加以比較，一句話，爲了自己的空想的實現肯誠實地去努力，只要這樣，是什麽毒害也不會有的，幻想和現實之間存在着什麼接觸的時侯，一切會都順利地進行的。</p>
<h3>上學</h3>
<p>— 陳福熙</p>
<p>進了學校，余知章就淌眼淚了。</p>
<p>他是高中二年級生，年齡約莫二十歲，但他總像小孩子似的天眞。他這次離家，眞感到一種深切的，離別的滋味。現在他進了校，獨個兒睏在冷淸淸的寢室裏，心裏只有排解不開的憂鬱。想起父母，覺得二十年來天天接受他們最誠摯的熱愛，一旦分別了，這種熱愛，往往更容易反映到余知章的記憶裏。離家誠是辛酸的，當人力車在父親的身旁轉過去時，他看見父親的額上淌着熱汗，正從什麼地方回來，手裏還拖着東西。</p>
<p>「路上當心，家裏的事用不着記掛的……」</p>
<p>父親說了這句話，車子終於拉遠了。余知章回顧頭來，只望到父親的白髮，在朝暾裏閃亮。</p>
<p>「父親眞的老了！」</p>
<p>他在洋車上想，好幾年不曾流的眼淚忽然流了……。想到父母的衰老，在余知章是很擔憂的，恨不得自己馬上成家立業，可以使雙親的晚景好一些。母親在最近三四年來，身子一天天壞，她的頭髮原是又長，又黑，又密，但現在時常脫，滿梳滿梳的脫；而且不僅脫，那幾根稀疎的頭髮，又在漸漸白起來。記憶力差了，食量减了，時常頭疼，腰酸，眼花，這些，都是不健康的象徵。至於父親呢？父親的身子比媽結實得多，但因生活的鞭策，往往被一般縉紳之流侮辱，原是開着個店舖，目下連店舖也關了。他沒有享過一天愉快的生活，中年時的父親是苦的，到了晚年，他的生活却仍是那麽慘澹……</p>
<p>照他家庭的狀况，在一個小資產沒落的經濟下，照理，他只有像一般人一樣，把自己的天才去埋沒，去犧牲，做一個起碼的店徒，過那種沒有靈性的奴隸生活。然而余知章居然能在高中裏唸書，他自己，已經感到滿足；雖然，他每學期的學費全是借貸來的。這次他到學校裏之前，他父親說：</p>
<p>「知章的學費怎麼籌措呢？」</p>
<p>「再到女婿那兒去設設法看……」母親說。</p>
<p>「去借嗎？」</p>
<p>「當然去借呀。」</p>
<p>「……」</p>
<p>父親不開口，他的臉更加陰沈了，籠罩他臉上的只是慘然的愁思。他對於這次借欵，似乎沒有把握，也許是借過好幾次，難以啟齒了。室中的燈，掉在長久的靜默裏。父親很難過，很憂鬱，爲了兒子的讀書，不惜把僅有的財產栽培他，所以翌日，等父親各處奔走，統通失了望以後，父親祇得把自家住的，一所破舊的平屋抵押了。</p>
<p>「祇有把房子抵押了」！</p>
<p>父親說。</p>
<p>下午，一個陰霾的下午：在客堂裏寫抵押契單時，父親的臉色，更加沉鬱得，慘澹得厲害了；在余知章有生以來，從未看見父親這樣悲愁。這破舊的平屋，是祖父的遺產，又是父親從小在這屋子裏長大的，他對於這平屋，有了深的疼愛，那疼愛的心，使他捨不得抵押。</p>
<p>父親的臉色雖是異常陰沉，但一寫過契約，拿到了彼方的抵押金，年老的父親終於又笑了：彷彿抵押屋子的事，在他已經忘懷了似的。</p>
<p>「錢有了，知章明天可以上學……」</p>
<p>邊說，一邊，父親把六十塊錢的鈔票交給知章，知章拿了錢便上學，但一想到經濟的來源，他的淚，每像梅雨樣的直淌了。</p>
<h3>恐怖生活的回憶（下）</h3>
<p>— 蘭如</p>
<p>北軍敗退時，整整地從我家的門首過了三天三夜。母親本來不想逃走的，但爲了我和三哥，姊姊苦苦的請求，她才和我們一同逃到祖母的姪女—表姑—家裏。這里是一個山抝，離我家有六里路，母親每天要爬到山頂去看幾次，回來時老是流着淚吿訴我們：「老屋裏燒完了，現在又在燒台上了，我家的屋子雖然還存在，但一會兒就要沒有了！」</p>
<p>「說不定還要燒到這裏來，聽說王家冲已殺掉了四十幾個老百姓，房子通通燒光了。」</p>
<p>表姑也嘆息着說。</p>
<p>「他們到這里來時，我們不耍逃走，就大家死在一塊吧，我是捨不得和兒女離開的。」</p>
<p>說着，母親忍不住大哭起來了，我們也被這句話感動得流淚。</p>
<p>「哼！不走嗎？太危險了！」表姑丈驚惶地說着。「李家坪一個八歲的小姑娘，和一個剛要生產了的大肚皮都被他們强姦死了！這些東西連畜生都不如，比土匪遝厲害，就是一百歲的老太婆，他也是一樣地要摧殘的。」</p>
<p>「一命抵一命，爲什麽不抵抗呢？」姐姐說。</p>
<p>「媽，我口袋裏有小刀，我可將他們的喉管割破。」</p>
<p>到是我這句話，引得他們都苦笑了。</p>
<p>幾晚來，大家都不曾閉眼，只有我和八歲的表弟，躺在一條長凳上，每天只聽到劈拍劈拍的榆聲，因爲民衆抵抗的緣故，所以他們老是開放機關槍。鄕里人是從來不知道這東西的，聽了「苦苦苦」的聲音，都以爲這是自己的喪鐘在響了。</p>
<p>「菩薩呵，快點殺死那些狗東西吧，我們再不能活下去了！」</p>
<p>母親跪在神前這樣祈禱。</p>
<p>「我……我……我已經把刀磨快了，我……我……我要回去殺掉我的女孩。」</p>
<p>忽然一個年約四十歲的寡婦手裏拿着白晃晃的菜刀，這樣邊流淚，邊說着走過去了！</p>
<p>「爲什麼？你瘋了嗎？」</p>
<p>表姑一手抓住了她。</p>
<p>「不！我沒有瘋，我的女孩不願死在野蠻的土匪手裏，我要親自殺死她。」</p>
<p>「你忍心嗎？」</p>
<p>「殺死了她，我自己也死，有什麽忍不忍心！自己殺自己，總比給人家殺來得好！」</p>
<p>母親聽了她的話，望望我，又望望哥哥，最後她竟號淘大哭起來了……</p>
<p>是北軍敗退的最後一天，母親在山頂上望到我家的房屋正在冒烟，述忙氣喘喘地跑來對我們說：</p>
<p>「孩子們，你們好好地在這裏，千萬不要出去，我們的房子被燒掉了，我要趕快去搶一點東西出來。」</p>
<p>說着，她頭也不回地走了，我和三哥都拚命地跟着她跑，走到半途，子彈如暴雨一般打來，母親連忙回轉來把我們往後面拖。過了一會，我們又走到前面，她又把我們拖回來，最後她爲得要趕快去救火，不顧一切地往前奔去！三哥隨在她的後面，我因爲裹了脚，跑不快，慢慢地一個人在最後走着。</p>
<p>噗通一聲，我倒在田裏了，睜眼一看，原來我的脚踢住了一個血淋淋的人頭，屍首擺在路的左邊，心，肺，肝，腸，肚子都被挖出來了。這生來沒有看見過的慘狀，我駭得魂飛天外，很久還爬不起來。最後我的兩眼向前望着正在燃燒的房子，不知怎的忽然胆大起來，什麽都不怕，只是衝上前去，路上擺滿了死屍，血腥的氣味直向鼻孔裏鑽，心裏感到一種說不出的凄凉和恐怖，但兩只小脚仍然不住地在往前狂奔。</p>
<p>回到家了，因爲很多鄰居趕來救火，房子只燒去兩間，保存着的也已經沒有門窗了，地上堆滿了屎，像厠所似的臭得不能進去，母親辛辛苦苦餵大的兩只猪也被他們殺掉吃了，猪皮和腸子丟在天井裏發臭，後面坪裏横躺着三副在血泊裏的死屍，天空是灰黯的，幾隻烏鴉「呱」的一聲從屋簷上飛過了，母親連忙跪下來對天磕頭</p>
<p>「菩薩呵！求你保佑，該再沒有什麽災禍了吧！」</p>
<p>從這時起，北洋軍閥的兇惡，野蠻，無惡不做的印象，已深深地印入了我的弱小的靈魂。</p>
<h3>「做人與做文」</h3>
<p>— 大陵</p>
<p>林語堂先生很可憐於「激昂派」的「現代小作家」，因為他們有一種「特別壞脾氣」，那就是喜歡「罵人」。據林先生說，「你想這樣到處罵人的人，就是文字十分優美，有誰敢用，所以常要弄到失業，然後怨天尤人，詛咒社會。這種人跳下黃浦，也於社會無損。……拉他起來，呌做罪過。」</p>
<p>接着，林先生便指出這班人的「毛病」，是因爲「通常人情世故之ABC尙且不懂」的緣故，「所以我如果有甚麽機關，還是敢用商店學徒，而不敢用激昂派靑年。」他覺得「今日吃苦的商店學徒禮貌都在大中學生之上，人情也比靑年作家通達。」</p>
<p>如果「激昂派」的「小作家」能够由此觀之，當會得着一種很好的做人和謀生的敎訓，——首先，應該通達人情，學習禮貌，於是，你便不致「到處駡人」了，於是，便有人喜歡用你，於是，你不致「失業」。</p>
<p>但我想，單只學會了「不駡人」，還算不得通人情」，有「禮貌」，譬如說，你不曾駡過當今的名流，不見得名流就會給飯你吃，這是很顯明的。就算這是名流不詔識你的緣故罷，世界上儘有你認識而且很熟習的人，因爲你說話的技術不高明，也不會給飯你吃的。</p>
<p>我們因此可以看出說話不僅不要駡人，而且不要觸着實際，萬一有一觸實際的必要，也不要直說，要繞灣見，最好能够練習得句句「幽默」。於是，便有人喜歡你，便有人給飯你吃了。</p>
<p>吾道一以貫之，做人如是，做文也應如是。</p>
<h3>嚮晚　（十）（五）</h3>
<p>— 屈軼</p>
<p>「哈哈」！抽着口烟，噴着一聲笑。胡一元像鷺鷥似的伸一伸頭頸。「也還是拿咱們的呀！特稅局還不是稅到咱們吃的人身上，——噯，這且不必說，我還沒有到沒飯吃的地步，讓你們去多分幾個肥吧。我可——我要幹——我是講整數的一千二千，一萬二萬！——唔——你別摸我鼇脚了呀」！說着，用手推一把那旁邊坐着的女人。手剛落在那女的奶奶上。女的假意地呌出了一聲淫蕩的「噯」！接着：又「不要動手動脚呀」！說了一句，表示自己是個多麼正經的女人。同時，又看到對面坐着那個女的，却在做鬼臉，手指指那個還在抽烟的胡一元，像叫她自己該對這旅長有更進一步的動作。</p>
<p>「那麼——論梅花歌舞團那篇文章呢」？紅底白點頭又擺動起來了。「權利不要享，義務總得盡哪！再說，這碼頭上，用你名字發表文章是響喨的，響喨的。」</p>
<p>「文章嗎？哦哦！老郭！老郭」！胡一元又呌起來了。</p>
<p>在坑床間站了老一會兒，給他們冷在一邊不理的老郭，正起了一陣埋沒英雄之感，想蕩出坑床間外去，這時，又給胡一元突然叫住了。「老郭，你給我做一篇文章。駡駡梅花歌舞團，如何？你說，你說，我旅長閱人多矣，那些歌女底大腿，大腿呀一點也不那個！何况，何况，她們速咱們記者也不招待。我是，唔，我是，唔。……」烟筒又擱上嘴邊了。</p>
<p>「但——」新文學家，回過身來，「但我此刻要洗澡去了。我非洗操去不可了。——過會兒，我可——可給你做一篇歌女必須洗腿論吧！……說着，竟向洗澡間走去。誰也不知道新文學家，在如何搆思洗腿論了。</p>
<p>「不過！今晚，今晚她們總算送了五張入塲券來。五張——」紅底白點頭的文學家看看新文學家去遠了，才安心地又從衣袋裏探出幾張紅紙片來。</p>
<p>「五張！五張！」一聲麻麻的尖叫聲。屁股上又像給蜂刺似的扭了一下，紅頭文學家立刻翻起身來。拍着屁股說：</p>
<p>「糟糕糟糕！有臭虫，有臭虫呀」！</p>
<p>「嘻喀」！這善做鬼臉的「白粉共胭脂一色」的姑娘，低低地笑了，用眼示着意，也在呌對面那個女的這麽做。可是正當她一霎眼間，紅頭文學家鷄爪似的手，一把抓住她裸着的臂膀。</p>

<p>貢獻話</p>
<h3>他國提倡國貨的情況</h3>
<p>— 紀謙</p>
<p>在這生存競爭的潮流中，大家都想本國貨物能充分的推銷，於是大家都努力着提倡國貨的宣傳，我國現在的形勢已够緊張了，看看別國怎樣的，至少可以給我們一個參考吧！</p>
<p>（一）英國組織愛國聯盟會，發起購用國貨週，勸用國貨。此外又發起了「購買國貨運動週」，「國產棉布週」…等等。</p>
<p>（二）德國他們認爲愛用國貨的，才是國家健全的公民，才是國中的優秀份子，他們的誡言如下：</p>
<p>一·不要把外國貨的食品放在你的桌上；</p>
<p>二·德國造的紙，要用德國造的筆和墨水來寫，並且要用德國吸墨紙；</p>
<p>三·眞正給我們德人精力的，只有德國麵粉果實和啤酒；</p>
<p>四·你假使不歡喜喝德國咖啡，你可以喝德國殖民地的咖啡；</p>
<p>五·你應當穿德國的布，戴德國的帽子。</p>
<p>（三）法國他們對於外國貨，像罐頭食品等·强制註明原來出產國的國名，對於麵包原料，强制用國產小麥。</p>
<p>（四）比國因爲擁護法郎——法幣名稱——的價格，特設「比利時法郞日。」法郞擁護聯盟會的宣傳標語上有幾句話說：「你的祖國是比利時，你必定要和你祖國共生共死，你要節儉，要愛用國貨，不要浪費。</p>
<p>（五）丹麥每逢星期，設「丹麥日」，　力宣傳，使用國貨，且張貼許多了國貨商標在公共塲所，或來往要道以示分別。</p>
<p>（六）挪威獎勵使用國貨，在公共塲所，不許張貼外國貨的廣告。</p>
<h3>申新七廠的強被拍賣與國貨前途</h3>
<p>— 玄萬</p>
<p>最近——二月二十七日，我們大家讀報的，一定知道國貨工業史上，又發現空前沉痛的一頁吧！事實是這樣，七年前的申新紗廠，曾因經濟關係，向英商匯豐銀行押欵二百萬元，現以到期不能償付，被該行竟於二十六日在魯意師摩洋行拍賣，結果爲一日人以二百二十五萬元購去，正式成交，我方現在在積極交涉中云。</p>
<p>從這一個事實的昭示，我們自然更加深地明瞭，中國工業在帝國主義經濟侵略下的前途，是已這般地危竭，這號稱碩果僅存——輕工業之「王」的紡績業，代表中國民族工業的申新廠，目下已達到如許的地步，於外來暴風雨的侵襲下，已由「停工」「减工」，而到整個破產的階段，國際資本主義市塲獨佔，傾銷榨取的結果，也可更具體地表現，猙獰的面目，兇惡的手段，怎樣摧殘我國實業的姿態，我們可在這事態的發展上，更確切的望到，並且「痛定思痛」，在這時侯，至少可給與我們下列兩個最慘痛的刺激。</p>
<p>一，中國工業，到處受人牽掣，而帝國主義經濟侵略的後盾，却正是强有力的政治力量，在華外廠能以種種特惠，由傾鉗而至整個市塲的獨佔，進而至操縱全國的供求，些微本國工業自身的力量，自然遠非敵手；受摧折而宣吿崩潰。</p>
<p>二，帝國主義在這個時候，完全地揭起了他平日的假面目，已使我們領受劉傾銷結果的風味，從這裏，却也正可加强我全國民衆自我努力的信念，知道民族經濟的復興，在依藉外資勢力下，是永遠得不到希望的，我們必須掙脫外人的桎梏，努力建築自己的園地，向眞正的中國工業生產前途邁進。</p>
<p>總之，這一次匯豐拍賣申新事件，實不能作爲申新一廠的成敗看，他的關鍵，實在是整個國貨工業前途的問題，嚴重的敎訓，吿訴我們必需澈底自悟了，此後，金融界和我生產界，務以調協國民經濟的機構，勿再將民族工業被外人有操縱的機會，應以大量資金援助我們，我工業界也益加努力，謀改進技術，節减成本，和外貨相競爭，而政府尤應將最大的力量，保護和扶持，全國的民衆，一致起來作後盾，這樣，今日的失敗，也許就是將來產業復興的徵兆呢</p>
<p>至於目下我國貨各集團正在謀如何救濟申新七廠，和匯豐力爭，這尙牽涉到司法問題，外交問題，恕本文短論中所不能再加詳述了。</p>
<h3>丁育三女士發明自動針織機</h3>
<p>— 菱湖昭</p>
<p>丁育三女土，生長於鄧縣地方。她幼時就非常聰敏，及長畢業於省立女師。對於各種理化功課，最喜歡研究。</p>
<p>一九二八年，丁女士發明手工製造草帽，和創辦針織工廠。在去年的夏季裏又發明靈巧自動針織機，這種織機構造簡單，但對於各種毛織棉紗衣衫背心以及圍巾童帽等品，都能織成；比那舊法棒針編結織品，敏捷到數十倍哩。</p>
<p>那種機體，輕便異常，隨時隨地，均可工作，所出物品，也很平勻很美觀，花樣和顏色可任意改變。實業部以該發明人丁育三女士，獨具匠心；創造機器，對於平民職業方面，裨益良多，除專令奬勵外，幷發給專利證書，准於專利五年云。</p>
<p>最近丁女士爲普及平民工藝，以推廣生產起見，首先在汴設立自動針織機織品工藝傳習所，免費傳習，擬說報名學習者，甚爲踴躍。</p>
<h3>利用五金工廠參觀記</h3>
<p>— 張孟昭</p>
<p>在這洋貨充斥，白銀外流的關頭，購用國貨，是人人應盡的責任，對於國貨製造工廠，尤其應該注意和認識。前天星期休假，余偕杜君逸臣，驅車赴虹口胡家木橋嘉德里，參觀利用五金工廠，承楊志義君出而招待，引導參觀工塲，見製造機車床等排列整齊，職工四十餘人，俱受過相當的敎育，正在埋頭工作，經理兼工程師沈鴻君浙江海寗人，富於機械學識，與製造經騐，督率職工，孜孜不息。楊君吿我云「該廠出品有門鎖，檯鎖，保管箱鎖，鋼窗鎖，銀箱鎖，司匹令狗牌門鎖等數十種，並能代客設計定製，惟一宗二，是薄利推銷，喚起國人樂用國貨爲前題，客戶採用的，有上海郵政局，上海鋼窗公司，浙江實業銀行等，經售的，有中國國貨公司，上海國貨公司，永安，先施，等公司，創辦人係胡廉淸，楊鏡淸，沈鴻，張潤達，楊志義，並云股東兼任推銷，未有絲毫開支加重工廠負担」云云余深覺楊君的話，確可供其他工廠之效法，尤其難能可貴的，是製造必需的工具，乃沈工程師和工友自己所瓶造，余等參觀殊爲滿意，爰撰文以吿國人</p>
<h3>國貨展覽會在常熟</h3>
<p>— 意虹</p>
<p>在全國國貨運動怒潮澎湃之下，侷促於內地的常熟，居然也有參觀國貨展覽侖的呼聲，從一般人們很覺欣喜的喊出。原來上海各廠家聯合組織的流動性國貨展覽會，又第二次開慕了，此次參加廠商計有五洲皂廠，亞光電木玉廠，雪恥陽傘廠，永固油漆廠，第一牙刷廠，永豐電池廠，雲福祥絲巾廠，萬生食品公司，益利料器廠等二十二家。雖然國貨的範圍很廣，但是東麟西爪，可見一斑。</p>
<p>這次舉行展覽的地點在常熟城裏市中心的慧日寺，一方面爲了地位適宜的關係，另一方面因了人們受好奇心的驅使，所以開幕的那天，參觀的和購買的很是擁擠，雖然沒有舉行什麽隆重的典禮，可是在寺前一帶的市中心區就無形中造成了國貨運動的空氣：於此可以見到我們平日空口宣傳不如實地示范來得容易引動人家的注意。婦女國貨年和學生國貨年抓往了時代的巨輪，所以參觀的人們中，尤其婦女和學生最多；他們購買國貨的品種，雖是各有不同的目的，但是愛護國貨工業的精神，却一樣底熱誠。</p>
<p>在這二十二廠家之中，尤以亞光電木玉，張小泉剪刀，大中華賽璐珞出品頂引起觀者的興趣。其他各家也都給常熟人不少良好的印象。我希望不但上海的國貨廠商常到內地來展覽，並且還須各地的特產，互相觀摩，那末，這種流動展覽的前途，真是無限呀！</p>
<p>在白銀出口，全國恐慌的當兒，我們苟翻開海關進出口統計一看，就知道歷年貿易的入超鉅額，早已註定白銀流出的命運。去年海外銀價飛漲，有利可　，不過從外商銀行庫裏移到國外去罷了。阻止白銀流出的根本辦法，祗有减少入超，要想减少入超，祇有使得人人决心服用國貨，提倡國貨，推廣國貨，國貨展覽會就負着這重大的使命！</p>

<h3>洋拆市仍混沌</h3>
<p>昨日市塲中消息閒散、交易亦稀、洋拆依舊勿動、早午兩市同為九分、劃頭無加水一律白劃、拆票交易、緣無人肯拆出、致形勢冷靜、故成交數目有限、然昨日較勝、計轉賬額有三百十餘萬、新交易三十餘萬、午市交易二十餘萬、小總會中交易四十餘萬、客路來源二十萬、去胃五萬、鈔票交易、收回五十餘萬、發出九十餘萬、洋押欵交易取贖五十餘萬、新做出七十餘萬、又華商各方面代解洋米欵一百二十餘萬、銀行收解、外商銀行收解票欵二百九十餘萬、各種貨滙押墊雜欵收解五百十餘萬、外匯結價欵一百三十餘萬、出倉四十萬、華商各銀行收解票欵二百三四十萬、各種貨匯稅墊押雜諸欵收解五百二三十萬、外匯結價欵九十餘萬、出倉五十萬、日商銀行收解票欵一百三四十萬、各種貨匯雜欵收解一百八九十萬、特滙欵三十餘萬、外匯結價欵八十餘萬、進倉三十萬、錢莊洋公單收解二千五百餘萬、洋劃頭欵收解三百三十餘萬、各路滙欵三十餘萬、收現六十餘萬、</p>

<h3>江角早市挺秀</h3>
<p>昨市江南小洋、晨初略有買胃、故價上挺、計為八百三十七元五角、較前日改好一元五角、午市同價、惟形勢終難久站、恐不久仍須下墜、做出交易、早市五千角、午市無交易、廣東小洋、早市為七百三十三元二角、較前日跌小七角、午市價格亦同、做出交易早市十八萬角、午市七萬角、銅元仍無上落、計為三百三十一千文、做出交易四萬六千三百四十串、合代價洋一萬四千元、</p>
<h3>證券借欵問題震盪債市</h3>
<p>砟華商證券交易所、市面起極度震盪之象、初以多頭出籠而疲、繼以空頭抵補而大漲、終以消息不佳而猛跌、市價一日三變、完全受環境空氣條忽不定之影響、蓋以國際借欵、初傳愈益接近、後以晚報傳日本反對而起阻碍、市價隨此狂抬狂跌、稍有春氣之市塲、因此又大受打擊、趁勢前進、因借欵問題、尚多波折、恐不免尚有數度之波動也、昨日經過、上午開盤、各帮零星賣出而跌、略小三四角、次盤四號十六號等、進胃極濃、檯面至為緊張、市價上騰甚勁、鹽稅猛漲九角半、午後開盤、稍形恍惚、交易極旺、各種大部續好三四角、而鹽稅獨小二三角、多方陣綫、顯有搖動、收盤忽傳日本反對國際借欵、雖北帮故意拉提編遺、以亂視綫、終以空方踴躍、由疲而跌、入後愈跌愈猛、金短驟小八角半之多、市價結果、前列微高一二角、而編遣裁兵、獨漲六七角、後列自二十捲以後、則均小二三角不等、九六又尚好三四角、成交總數、約計三千萬元、</p>
<h3>美元續挺　紐約股市頻跌不已</h3>

<p>四日　五日　比上日</p>

<h3>紗花　標紗花繼續上漲</h3>
<p>紗市續漲、形勢漸現安定之象、因匯兌轉穩、金價漲勢銳不可當、致空頭活動抵補、市盤乃漲、同時現紗銷路益覺發展、豫省對於十七支紗、購辦連續、蜀帮因匯率便宜、銷胃亦健、故人心方面、愈為鞏固矣、</p>
<p>遠月紗又好七八角</p>
<p>標紗前市開盤、各月均呈微昂之象、但塲中新買者少、拍至三收盤、聞金市狂漲、浮戶稍有抵補、漲二·三·四·六·角、惟本月跌一角、午後開盤、市情繼續良好、而現紗客銷興奮、有三千餘包、但行情不動、然市塲未能十分趨高、因新買者缺乏、而成交甚少、實以有多顯公司組織之後、一般散戶對於拋賣、均具戒心、所以雖有良好消息播來、無空頭扒補、因此紗市反動、不若棉市之烈、結果各月又漲一·二·四·角、查賣出大孚七百五十包、穗隆六百包、仁豐七百五十包、泰昌六百包、潤康九百五十包、愼記六百包、益昶五百包、長豐一千一百五十包、買進通記八百五十包、裕康六百包、大豐一千〇五十包、同豐五百包、愼記五百五十包、長豐一千包、元一一千五百包、一日間最高低價及收盤價如下、</p>

<p>花市隨金價猛漲、美印棉市雖疲、而滙兌大縮、一日改縮幾檔、致人心轉昂、寗波帮突來大批扒補、約有三萬餘擔、市盤漲氣愈激、但外商仍無舉動、棉市前途、據棉業中人云、還有數角漲力、</p>
<p>鄭標續好三四角</p>
<p>標花前市開盤、英棉平平、印棉趨跌、然美國銀價遠期縮小一百多磅音、金價猛漲、故塲中拋賣者較鮮、市價隱伏漲風、拍至二盤又跌、後聞金價穿出八百九十元外、漲勢甚銳、寗波帮大批扒空、收盤形勢較昂、結果各月均漲一角半至二角半、午後開盤、市况尚堅、寗波仍來扒補、惟源大乘漲時出檔、市氣壓平、但至收盤時尚佳、結果各月又漲五分至一角半、杳賣出源大一萬一千九百擔、泰興二千六百擔、仁豐三千七百擔、益昶三千六百擔、大昶二千二百擔、生源三千四百擔、益康四千擔、新亭一千七百擔、吉豐一千八百擔、森康一千八百擔、買進賡豐九千一百擔、長豐六千四百擔、源興昌七千擔、長和一萬九千九百擔、裕大一千八百擔、均昶一千五百擔、一日間最高低價及收盤價如下、</p>

<h3>匯市不定　美棉跌風未息　英印棉亦然見疲</h3>
<p>昨美棉開盤、市况堅穩、近月因同業限價買進、頗形挺秀、惜為利物浦軟勢所抵銷、大陸及遠東均有買進、利物浦帮則售出、本地帮及紐奧崙經紀商亦拋賣、又穀類及股票跌小、致引起華爾街之售賣、投機家因國外滙兌及棉業立法之不定、無從着手、紡織業前途暗淡、紗廠正在考慮减工問題、收盤平平、計現貨不動、本月漲二磅音、餘月跌一至五磅音、英棉因金鎊上漲而疲、計現貨跌四點、期貨跌五點、印棉因散戶跨賣、略形疲弱、計平果爾跌一·二五羅比、奧辣姆不動、白羅溪跌一羅比、原電錄左、（五日電）</p>
<p>平果爾　一四二·二五　跌一·二五　一九·四〇</p>

<p>又據孟買電、七日白羅溪花之開盤預測、為二百四十七羅比、較上日收盤跌半羅比、</p>
<h3>糧食粉麥又跟金價趨升</h3>
<p>粉市上午開盤後、各月份又呈一致激漲之象、以洋麥報價、芝加哥會跌二三角左右、坎拿大跌四分至一角零、當開盤後、以國際之匯兌好轉、命價又逐步暴升、是以業內外人心、均見良好、更以本月份因現粉奇緊、不但二號粉須定日批裝、即三四號粉、亦無現可出、人心之反漲、一半亦與現粉有關也、迨下午開盤、初尚平定、後因大部分浮空、鑒於現粉之緊、不免發生惶恐、抵補一殷、市氣即步步高昂、本來此次之跌風、純為金價所牽動、今形勢一變、自然回復甚易也、結果本月份漲二分七釐半、四月份漲三分二釐半、五月份漲二分半、六七八月份各漲三分七釐半、</p>
<p>麥市上下午開盤後、各月份均見穩定之態、以洋麥報價、芝加哥小二三角左右、坎拿大小四分至一角不等、上午開盤時、市氣均呈平定、故上落甚微、迨至下午開盤、因粉市回漲甚烈、並以金價之回升、人心遂亦轉好、不過業外買戶甚少、廠家均自定巨額之洋麥、故趨勢雖好、漲度未見巨大也結果三月份好三分、四月份好六分、七月份好四分、現麥市况、連擯多日、昨因雙方談判接近、始有做開、計山東歸德麥三元七角七分、蚌埠麥三元七角半、江北六合麥三元七角二分、次七角、共四千包、由申大信大辦去、</p>

<h3>長江帮辦洋米萬餘包　—價大一角至五分—</h3>
<p>昨洋米客化甚旺、尤以長江各帮為貪、因長江各埠產區平價飛升、滬價低落後反又匯劃、昨九江帮最活、辦去西貢米近萬包、漢口帮亦最後成交三四千包、南京及內地各埠尤為食辦、本街反為退縮、全日開出西貢暹暹小絞各半達二萬五千包、圓粒西貢漲近一角、其它各大五分、客秈久無新到、中存亦微、昨內地辦去機糙紅米一千多包、價亦跟好五六分、</p>
<h3>米市到稀稍見轉平</h3>
<p>（滬南）昨日各新來源十餘號、（貨共近三千石）、銷塲本街尚屬乎淡、而包胃亦祗天津烟台等帮辦五六百包、惟市况以連朝到稀、人心稍定、故各厚粳及首稻價其較高者悉巳站住、無甚榮辱、僅中次者因問津不多帶軟、陰元變元平疲、杜尖無上落、</p>
<p>（滬北）昨日河下各路來船十五六艘、各貨去路早市平淡、價雖仍小數分、午市略有問津、致價轉站定、薄更到貨落稀、另貨尚可、價形定局、尚有各貨價格疲軟、</p>
<h3>芝蔴抵空見好　—黃豆交易不弱—</h3>
<p>昨日黃豆市况、乘上日之良好市氣、辦胃見加、計廠家辦去毫州芝九車、價自三元五角六至五角三、廠家及通州帮合辦歸德芝一千餘包、價扯三元七角半、又合取蚌埠之五車、價為三元四角七至四角三、漢口乍芝由本街內地及通州帮採去二千餘包、價自三元四角九至三角八、行情因貨戶扳售而帶緊、行情因各方關係、暫少把揰、洋庄芝蔴寂静久矣、前日有成交二百噸、價開八元七角半、昨有業餘掮客洋行抵空買進二百噸、價開九元、</p>
<h3>五金　青鉛到旺銷滯</h3>
<p>靑鉛近來交易異常滯呆、蓋客帮生意尚無動情、而廠家交易、亦十分稀少、因此市象之寂寞、幾可云為極點、惟到源一節、則十分衆多、因此存積之厚、足供三四月銷塲而有餘、緣是標準一節、異常軟弱、刻佔十四元一二角、而火票買賣、則尚可廉至十四元光景、聞連日開出祗有二三百條而已、惟近來海外定價、亦十分軟弱、計每噸估美金五十二元、比之上次來電亦小去二元之多、因之本埠市面、一時殊不易回好也云、</p>
<h3>糖市　粵粗白猛漲六角</h3>
<p>昨日糖市、因關金飛漲最高曾到一八五〇、收盤一八〇五、趨勢因之激升、糖業合作公司標兌廣東粗砂白三千三百六十五包、價為十六元九角、結果承購者踴躍、求過於供、袛得照額以六八攤派、如數兌運、其中有轉口者、照退四角半、比前（四日）突漲六角、又二四荷粗砂白轉口一百五十包、四元九角、亦升角半、太古B嘜十七元九角、比升二角半、本廠綿自振裕一號十六元七角、二號六角、三號四角半、四號三角、比最低回升七角、潮靑前昨兩日開出五百包之譜、價亦帶堅、提靑為十元四角、以次十元一二角、至九元二角、</p>
<h3>南北貨　汕柑餅突跌二元</h3>
<p>汕頭柑餅、前盤曾到二十七八元、近因正值出新之際、又適滙水尚長、劃申成本較低、昨聞各號來貨為數轉增、當有開出、價為二十五元、比前竟跌二元之鉅、如後貨不湧、或可暫定、</p>
<h3>絲茶　貢熙綠茶略有走銷</h3>
<p>近日洋莊茶市、因國外銀價疊升、匯市昂貴、市面異常沉寂、珍眉珠茶等貨、日前錦隆恊和等洋行、雖因華商讓價求售、多有電訊發出、然均杳無音問、惟路莊貢熙綠茶、昨市白頭莊瑞昌焀隆等行、買進三百七十餘籍、市盤做開二十二三元、較上月銷售之貨、見低三四元、商家所受虧折、頗為鉅大、</p>

<h3>點滴</h3>
<p>— （金雄宇）</p>
<p>朋友的老伯伯死了，延富　迫薦，悲哀中非常熱鬧。但是我祇看見一對性的判决無期徒刑者；法壞邊一個十來歲的小和尙，　　裏一個年未三十的來亡人。（程珍如）</p>
<p>吾人碌碌于世，無所表見，直如吃燒餠一般；馬齒漸長，是咬在餅邊：寰朽就木，是吃到中心。迨乎長辭人世，則餅已食靈：僅有無數狠　的芝蔴，待後人一一檢點收拾而已。</p>
<p>于是世上人少一燒餠，而我亦永永不復再見於人世：久而久之，竟并我之姓氏里居而泯滅之，　不大佳？余嘗謂吾人最好一生不落迹象，彼動績彪炳，名垂千古者，特不想穿此意耳。</p>

<p>自覺心是進步之母，自獲心是墮落之源，故自覺心不可無，自殘心不可有。像昨天敝友來函，提及×君爲了失業的問題，就連飯都不吃，據說情願做餓死鬼，你想，像這種自殘心是否是我們靑年應當有的嗎。我們試分析這種心理，實是自己看不起自己，自己不願做有爲的靑年。試再作進一步心理上的分析，便知這是發生了自覺心以後的自殘心。以堂堂一個有爲的靑年，乃具有這種自殘心，殊屬可惜。這種潛伏在靑年腦子裏的自殘心，苟非剷除凈盡，則我靑年的前途，實少希望，而將人人跑上墮落的路。</p>
<p>所謂自覺心，簡言之卽自覺有何長處，便當極力保存而更發揚光大，自覺有何短處，便當極力避免而更奮發看爲。自覺心所以能爲進步之母者，卽在乎此。若自覺有所短而存着自殘的心理，便是自甘永居卑劣的地位，所得的結果，是頽廢，不是進步。</p>
<p>我國在此混亂的時代，當然有許多不滿人意的地方。我們所該努力的方向，是要靠我們自己，羣策羣力把不滿意的地方，使它變成滿意。否則你儘管不願去做，終究不會滿意的；想穿了這一點，我們自覺之後，只用得着自奮，用不着自殘，我們當光明磊落泰然坦然的做去，盡我們心力，做一個肯求進步的靑年。</p>
<h3>怪姓錄</h3>
<p>— 椀</p>
<p>中國研究姓氏的書，除一本蒙學讀物「百家姓」之外，我沒有看見過什麽專籍，所以中國的姓氏，不知究竟有多少？就我所知道的：「百家姓」上沒有記載着的姓，而現在却時常遇見着的，實在不少—而且有許多姓很奇怪！我姑且寫幾個出來瞧瞧！</p>
<p>上海冠生園的主人洗冠生，（冼）與洗異，姓洗已經很少了，他却比洗字少了一點。上海河南路，有一家藥舖洗種福堂，它的主人就姓洗。（蹇）春秋時侯，晋國有蹇叔，現在上海文壇上，有一位寒先艾，不知道是不是蹇叔的後人？（戢）北平軍分會的委員戢翼翹，（策）有一位策覺林，現在常在報上看見他。（門）豫軍的師長門致中。（井）井岳秀，也是豫軍師長。（况）西康建省委員會的委員祝傳義。（尋）江西方面俘虜着的僞十九師師長呌尋維洲。（寸）第三軍第十二師的旅長呌寸連捷，他是雲南人。（明）第三軍的軍醫處長呌明紹武。（戎）海上名票友戎伯銘，大概知道他的人很多，（閃）我從前認識過一位姓閃的，他的先人呌閃殿魁，做過四川的提督，（偶）合肥敎育界有一位偶石君，（兀）音齊，懷寗有這一姓的人，上面這些姓，都極其冷僻的—還有（古）應芬，（居）正，（經）亨頤，（香）翰屏，（冷）遹，（辜）鴻銘，（區）芳浦，這幾位名人的姓，也都很少見，不過因他們太出名，倒變成見不鮮了</p>

<h3>小西天</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>他這樣完全吿哀的說法，眞呌張介夫聽了，良心軟下去大半截，除了和他同情，那裏還能說那欺壓他的話？自己頓了一頓，微笑了一笑，這話可就說不下去了。月英道：張老爺怎麽又不說了，我這話說的不對嗎？張介夫笑道，你說的是可憐的話，有什麼不對？不過我是代別人說話，我若說的不對，你倒不要見怪。嘿嘿！說着，他又笑了兩聲，這才向胡氏道：那賈先生的意思，以爲你若是肯把姑娘給他，那就早一點罷。胡氏道：就是這話嗎？那好說呀。只要賈老爺把我這三口人有個交代，隨便他挑個什麽日子，我們就把姑娘送來。張介夫點點頭道：你們的意思呢，自然是這樣，不過他不是把題目看得那樣大。他的意思，最好就是今天晚上，你把姑娘留在這裏，桌上那些洋錢，你就可以帶走了。胡朱氏呵呀了一聲道：這是啥話兒？婚姻大事，那有這樣隨便的。月英聽了這話，早是心裏砰砰亂跳，臉上好像用燒酒抹過，一直燒紅了到耳朶後面去，那頭也就向下低垂着，下巴頭是緊靠了胸襟。張介夫把話說到了這裏，若不說個愛情，更爲引起兩個人的誤會，而况他兩人好像也不過覺得奇怪，並不十分違抗。（一五〇）</p>
<h3>御香縹緲錄</h3>
<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>太后返　的消息原是單已傳　到了京中來的，所以在我們的火車未過豐台時，這裏的站上，已　着一大筆的官真了。上至皇親國戚，下至留守在宮中的宮娥太跑、凡有一些提會可以挨上來的，那個不臘來，太后　駕。價是那幾個頑固的大臣，當太盾來啟程以鉤，　是拚命的上奏章，口口聲聲的要阻止伊坐着火車上奉天去，但此刻也都忙着趕來了，在他們的心中，對於太后和我們這一起人的竟能安然回京，少不得總要有些　　的，或者會當做是太后的洪福所特致的奇跡，　非常理所許。那也不能細究了，太后見了這麽許多誠心誠意來迎接伊的人也並無怎樣興音的表示，祇略略看了他們一眼，便算數了。這是伊四十餘年來已見慣了，這種炫耀赫弈的排塲，因此不再有什麼特殊的　覺了。假使伊的性格並不是歡喜大權獨攪，睥睨一世的話，這種虛榮熱鬧的排塲，必然早就厭倦了！我往往在私下估量着，萬一有一個出人意外的機會，竟可使伊解除了一切的來縛，重新做起另外一個人來的話，伊究竟會不會就肯把伊所習慣了的種種行爲改變過來？這是大可研究的。現在呢，伊的生命裏雖然充滿着一種超人的權力，但快樂的成分是一些沒有的！</p>
<p>下了車，我們便一齊重上肩輿：這些抬轎的小太監們也像比往常跑得快了許多，雖然他們還是抬得很小心。（二六一）</p>
<h3>滬京航綫的回溯（下）</h3>
<p>— 枕綠</p>
<p>那時，在離高橋約六里的田畝間有一所　造局。高橋輪船常特地　　該局前的江　，祗爲該局西人夫婦倆到上海的便利。這一個小媚外的舊痕令人想起了便感到全民族的羞辱！有一次，因輪船上執事的言詞間得罪了一個搭客，這搭客呈准寶山縣府，也辦輪渡和舊輸作營業競爭。這家船票每客祇售銅幣二枚，那家售票同價，加送每客毛巾一條，各拚損失要達營業獨佔的結局。這又是勇於私阿的國民性的表現，可資紀念的一幕！</p>
<p>市輪船上設備進化，旅客都樂於趨搭。不過，那船上裝定的茶壺，其中茶水總是冷的時候居多，不論冬夏；厠所裏不備粗紙，這在船上也很難辦到；諸諸如此類，似乎違背設計者的初心。船上雖設意見箱，也不大發生影響的。很望辦事人始終弗懈，開展它光明的前路！</p>
<h3>黃晦聞最後之詩</h3>
<p>— （笑）</p>
<p>北大老敎授黄晦聞，（節）爲當代詩學泰斗，其所箋注古樂風曹飽謝阮各集暨毛詩纂辭詩律等，早已風行海內，不幸於去臘逝世，現京中陳樹人葉楚傖等開會追悼，其詩集名豪葭樓，月前由汪精衛出資印行，得六百餘首。其甲戌所作。亦止十首，最後絕筆爲送余越園南歸一絕句云：國計身謀未盡言，又傾殘淚入離尊，明朝送別歸高士，一醉鐙前似　原。其律詩最後之作，則爲遲王秋湄看花之約，句云：暗雨飄風落萬家，小樓心遠似奔車，寇來草木爭先後，春在陰晴去咄嗟，一夜澤蒲吹作　，半天　茀看成霞，丈夫老矣情何限，千里秋齋約爲花。廣陵絕響，法曲飄零，讀此亦足以知其懷抱之幽哀矣。又其詩集中尙有我詩一首，未經刻入，是詩作於壬申歲暮，時國難嚴重，故感憤傷時，流露字裏行間，句云：亡國哀音怨有思，我詩如此殆天爲，欲窮世事傳他日，難寫民間盡短詩，習苦　蟲惟不徙，食肥蘆鴈得無危傷心羣言經國，孰謂詩能見我悲。游踪所至</p>
<h3>毛公積雪</h3>
<p>— 吳雅非</p>
<p>在包山塲里，只要天下過一塲大雪，那就有一條彷彿玉龍般的山崗盤踞在朝陽山和背陰山之上，而且這里的雪，時常過了半月還沒有完全融消息的；這就是洞庭八景中的「毛公積雪」。從前我每當下雲之後，總耍踏着雪地，到包山塢里去看一回梅花和欣賞一次雪景的。因爲那里也有一大片梅林，它雖沒有鄧尉山香雪海那麽有名，可却也有暗香浮動，疎影横斜的那樣風致。</p>
<p>那里山深林密，古剎梵音，衆山起伏，雄偉莊嚴，置身其間，幾疑是世外桃源，尤其是那淸流潺潺的溪澗，奏出那琤琮的音樂，和着林間的小鳥，低唱着大自然里的歌曲，會逗起我們無限的留戀。</p>
<p>昨天下了一天大雪，今天那里可又「白雪　　玉作崗」了。恰巧我又返鄕在家，豈肯錯過了那天好機會；所以今天便和湄到包山踏雪　梅去。</p>
<p>天氣有些陰　，然而風卻不大，我們兩個人翻過了一座八砲山，便走上了漫長而平坦的常山路，兩面平常山里的楊梅樹和老松樹都給雪壓得低垂了頭。穿過紅山門。就到了石人石馬，傍邊楊樹潭里剩水却不多，上面小天竺上正有三五個小沙彌在戲雪。</p>
<p>「我們今天到慶雲寺里去喝茶去」。湄走得有些乏了，所以預備到慶雲禪寺里去坐坐，慶雲寺正劈對毛公峯，那是一隻有名的古剎。</p>
<p>「也好，我去叫和尙們準備些飯菜，就在那裏吃了午飯再上山去玩賞梅花。</p>
<p>踱過香花橋，大殿前一隻很髙的石塔　然地站在朝陽山坡上。我們走進大殿，四個奇長奇大的魔家四將，很怕人的分站在兩傍，里面是靜悄悄的沒有一個人，我就熟練地闖到了方丈室，看見幾個小和尙正在煽風爐茶。</p>
<p>坐不片刻，小和尙獻上了香茗捲烟，還有四盆乾菓，我喝了一口茶，就辨得出這是毛公峯上的名產，「個庭碧螺春」，用朝陽泉煮的，所以十分淸芬醇厚。我們正在閒談和觀賞屋後的風景，一位四十多歲的和尙却恭而敬之的來向我們合十，這便是方丈興隆法師。</p>
<p>飯後，我們便沿着一條羊腸山徑踱着，一路上欣賞着白雪梅花，蒼松古柏，把我的都市塵念，洗滌殆盡，我當時就口占了一絕七言詩，現在只記得後面兩句：「羣山深處林更密，梅花開時雪亦香。</p>
<p>回來，我們又採得了兩個鬼饅頭，和拗了兩株打皷竹。</p>

<h3>文場如戰場</h3>
<p>— 二郎</p>
<p>偶然看到一份新雜誌，照習慣翻一翻，有一幅漫畫描寫着兩個文人手提筆桿在打仗，題曰「文場如戰場」，不禁感慨系之。</p>
<p>「文人相輕」，雖然「古已有之」，卻亦真得「於今尤烈」。而筆戰的事，只因印刷術的發明與否大有關係，古不如今，更為顯然。（竹簡漆書時代，輾轉抄錄時代，比較印刷術昌明的現代，文人作文的難易相差不啻天壤之別。）</p>
<p>「筆戰」俗稱「打筆墨官司」，大體別之，可以分為兩類，一類是「論爭」，一類是「對駡」。「論爭」是各人於學術上的見解不同，或者於學說上的主張有異，而憑理論互相爭勝，因此亦呌「理論鬥爭」。從事「理論鬥爭」的人，共同的目標，都是為的闡明眞理；誰的理論是屬於眞理方面，或者比較接近眞理方面，勝負顯然，讀者卽可判决。「對罵」就不同。兩方「筆戰」旣然不是為的闡明眞理，亦自然幷沒有什麽理論可說，彼此各顯本領，明攻暗襲無所不為，甚至於強詞奪理不管是非，那是好像戲台上的丑角在演雙簧，只爭得台下觀衆（卽是讀者）的鼓掌喝彩吧了。</p>
<p>於今之世，真理不靈，公說公有理，婆說婆有理，在文壇上「理論鬥爭」便亦「不景氣」，給互相對駡的「雜文」佔了上風。「文塲如戲塲」亦就已經沒有那一種「下戰書」，「佈陣圖」的雍正氣派：彼此一出馬，舉槍揚刀，混殺之外，放暗器，毒瓦斯，成了「拚個你死我活」的「肉搏」情勢力。而「對駡」的「筆戰」，便是如今文壇的普遍現象。</p>
<p>「對罵」的「筆戰」，已經成為文壇上的風氣，而且有「英雄豪傑「在一耀武揚威」地助長這一風氣，看來是要高揚下去的了。有人說，「始作俑者」對於這一風氣，不知是引為快樂，或者是引為惶憂。我想，這是一種「勳續」，「始作俑者」是一定引為無上光榮與快樂的吧。</p>
<p>理論鬥爭「不景氣」，「對駡」的「筆戰」成了風氣　眞理在哭了。可是，眞理亦似乎已經到了「不景氣」的時代，——不是麽？早已經看不見眞理的「廬山面目」了？—還有什麽話好說呢？</p>
<p>「文塲如戰塲」，表面上看來，十分蓬勃有生氣，其實正是文壇的昏黃暗黑的不幸時代。</p>

<h3>汕島之夜</h3>
<p>— 辛爾</p>
<p>可懷念，可依戀的故鄉！</p>
<p>徘徊在街頭，望着天，統是一片迷失的冷威。渾身是酸軟萎頓，腦子是昏脹糊塗；對人間，對人生，都覺得落漠生疏無味。但有時腦海偏要閃上那絲已過逝了的甜蜜的故鄉的柔影，使人失神的，凄哀的湧着難堪的酸情，老愛忍着吞下自己的肚子裏的淚，會酸溜溜的濕着眼角。</p>
<p>咬緊牙根，忍住自己的痛苦，常常可以泰然安過。但是想起生我的故鄉，現在已是遍村在嗚咽的故鄉，故鄉裏那老淚流得眼睛快瞎了的母親……我忍不住慘酷的鞭擊了！我的四肢再亦沒有力量來支撑這笨重的身子。</p>
<p>彷彿，時常聽見媽駡着忍心的兒子老沒有信回家，但始終不明白我為什麽老連訊息都不給母親！要對母親說些什麽好吃！說自己有飯吃，為什麼不寄些給父母！說是在挨餓，那又何必把挨餓的事情告情她們！</p>
<p>「忍心的孩子呵！」我聽見這哀音時，我想不再活下去。心，腦，渾身，都碎　了。</p>
<p>我已經踏上　南的鄉士的　　　睡在同一情調的鄉音的親氛裏、。但我更紛亂了的心。越發深刻的，追憶起那浪子的旅心的哀苦。到了故鄉，聽到鄉音，，胸部凄　得更　亂。</p>
<p>好像闖進生疎可怕的異地。隔別了五年的故鄉，完全和記憶中的故鄉兩樣了。我的心比那思鄉的旅人的心更痛楚！景物都劇變了，心情更急動。自己是潦倒，故鄉更荒凉呵！不如歸去，已不是那種年代了！</p>
<p>靜寂的小旅店內，遠遠傳來街道　的黃包車上的鈴聲，特別盪來故鄉的意味。在這將進午夜的　聲，眞有些像詩人們所歌咏的，有如沙漠裏風鈴聲似的音調，斷斷續績的，給南國的微風輕飄夾來。</p>
<p>門內外的脚步聲騷動，心不由自主的跳盪，簫笛的吹音突起，小鑼聲有節奏的配合着，孩子的歌曲哀嗚似的婉奏、我的心波隨着抑揚幽低的歌音振盪。這更是故鄉的哀訴曲呵！那從鄉下流落出來的孩子，買唱着最會打動人心的悲劇裏的鄉曲度生，聲調的婉雅，就像惹人憐的孤兒在且哭且歌。夜更寂沉，人越凄亂，歌曲樂聲漸漸的更加凄沉悠揚，一陣陣的敲斷心　的夜曲鄉音。孩子的歌聲一家奏過一家，輾轉在床上，隱約迷離，像醒着又似在夢中。難堪的憂亂的心情，在懊悔不該徒然回來，只增加難受的歸鄉，溫柔明媚的汕島，今夜只有給我無限的迷亂。踏上鄉土的第一夜，我只是更加哀亂而已！故鄉，我惱恨牠，不如破碎到全毀滅吧！在這汕島一夜，印下了多少的哀愁呵！</p>
<h3>不值錢的寶欠</h3>
<p>昨日漏排畫題「生活的鞭撻」，特此更正</p>
<h3>海上隨筆</h3>
<p>— 蘆邨</p>
<p>在甲板上</p>
<p>下弦的月牙掛在天的一角，星兒疏疏的點在碧空。我獨自憑着船欄，心裏充滿了空虛的悵惘，讓濤聲喧擾我寂寞的心情。這時剛是新秋的時節，海風送來淸爽的意味，喚醒了被鬱悶所征服的官能。我坐在裝菠蘿的篾籠上，聞着果的香的息氣。</p>
<p>我是一個孤征的旅人，只帶了一顆希望的心。在這海天濛漠的旅程之間，危坐着，獨自在沉思。</p>
<p>我沉思着，想回答自己的問題。然而，假如要問我，希望甚麽，追求甚麽呢？我又朦朧了。</p>
<p>不過，我仍是沉思着，想着，我願意像一隻站在潮頭的海鷗，不願意做一隻木立灘頭的白鷺。</p>
<p>帆影</p>
<p>南望故鄉，北望前途，東邊是無涯的蒼海，西面是縹渺的雲山，許多帆影就在那邊跟着波濤低昂出沒，他們大概是靠海吃飯的人。</p>
<p>誠然　不少的人讚美海主的生活　是的，海是蔚藍的，天是蔚藍　　　　與落日，把海面塗得像紅霞，驚濤駭浪洶湧着銀色的花，誰能說海不是偉大，，美麗而富有詩意呢！</p>
<p>然而，　又能說海不是罪惡的深　呢？當我想起伊巴涅茲的「海上」。</p>

<h3>婚姻不自由的呼聲</h3>
<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>我現在有一個問題要來擾亂你，請你忙中抽暇，給我一個答覆。</p>
<p>我有一位朋友，姓黃現年二十一·已在某銀行服務，在一年前，認識同事陳女士，現年十七。二人由友誼而戀愛，熱情達至沸點，抱定非他不嫁，非她莫娶之念。故黃君特向（陳女士之家長求婚，陳女士父母均亡，祗有姑丈一人，是她的家長。）但是她的家庭却是一個舊式專制的家庭，竟遭拒絕。後來又經數次請求，結果都是失望。以致二人廢寢忘食，竟要走上死的一途，幸經友輩的勸導，纔使他們沒有實行自殺。但是有何種方法可以成全他們的事呢？現有下列幾個問題，請聰明的先生給我一個滿意的答覆罷！</p>
<p>（一）他們二人，都到了婚姻自决的年齡，可否自行訂婚，結婚，——但有朋友作證人——不受家庭之束縛？</p>
<p>（二）現在該女之家長—指娘舅—要把她許配他人—非陸君—雖經她幾次拒絕，願死不嫁，但竟不顧，請問用何方法對付，且以後如何佈排抵制之？</p>
<p>（三）他們二人，可否不受家庭束縛，各自走出結婚——經朋友證明——組織新家庭，是否犯法律？專上敬請撰安張劍秋上</p>
<p>編者按，民法中規定：未成年之男女，訂定婚約，應得法定代理人之同意。陳女士現在只有十七歲，她的姑丈（就是法定代理人）對於她的婚姻當然有監督的權利；如果陳女士未得姑丈的允許，不顧一切的和黃君訂婚，那末這種婚約在法律上是沒有效力的。所以黃陳的婚事除了向姑丈婉商外，別無他法。　者　暫時　提此事、等她　到成年的　　囑　　　　的　　那時　　」　　主的權利，一切就不成問題了。所以我們要勸雙方不必消極　只要意志堅決，不半途變更，則將來終有成功的希望。並且暫時不能結婚，對於愛情是一點沒有妨礙的；談愛並不一定要結婚啊！</p>
<p>為了使張君等較為明瞭起見　特將　　問題，再個別解答於後。</p>
<p>（一）男女達到婚姻自主的年齡，可以自行訂婚，結婚，不受家庭的束縛。惟須用公開的儀式並有證婚人二人以上者，方能有效。</p>
<p>（二）法律規定，婚約應由男女當事人　　訂立　姑　　得　　　可　代為訂定的婚約，本人可加以否認；並　婚約是不得強迫履行的。</p>
<p>（三）女方未達成年，假使貿然出外結婚，男方就有被控「誘拐」或「誘姦」的罪名的危險。這　　法的事、切不可行。</p>

<p>未交質之前，周為天子，鄭為諸侯，旣交質之後，周鄭等耳，亦何所憚哉，溫之麥，洛之禾，宜其梱載而不顧也，向若平王始惡鄭伯而亟　之，鄭雖跋扈，不過一叛臣耳，天子之尊，猶自若也，苟與之質，是自處以列國而不敢以天子自處矣，歲改月移，豈知周之為君哉，一旦用兵而不忌，非諸侯之叛天子也，是諸侯之攻諸侯也，使周素以天子自處，至尊至嚴之分，鄭　敢犯乎，惟周以列國自處，故鄭以列國待之，天下亦以列國待之，左氏亦以列國待之，周不自伐，鄭未必敢伐之也，無王之罪，左氏固不得辭，周亦分受其責可也，雖然左氏所載君子之言，固出於左氏之筆，然亦推本當時君子之論也，其論周鄭，概謂之二國，而靡所輕重，是當時之所謂君子者，舉不知有王室矣，戎狄不知有王，未足憂也，諸侯不知有王，未足憂也，至於名為君子者，亦不知有土，則普天之下知有王室者其誰乎，此孔子所以憂也，此春秋所以作也，此春秋所以始於平王也。</p>

<h3>電影發達的簡史（十）</h3>
<p>— 文瀛</p>
<p>（十）歐戰中戰事影片的盛况</p>
<p>我們大家都曾看見過許多無聲片子，其中五花八門，各色俱備。「西部片子」哩，戰事影片哩，家庭影片哩，野獸片子哩，可以分出無數種類出來。你或者以為我們看影戲，如同吃公司大菜一樣，侍者搬出來，我們就大嚼。但是你想差了。他們影片公司的製造影片，並不是他們自作主張去攝製的。照事實而論，他們拍製什麽影片，先要請教於觀衆，問他們喜歡不喜歡。</p>
<p>但是你如果不喜歡看一張片子，你怎機使攝製家知道呢？你用不著坐在影戲院裏，心神不安地反側著。你亦不用寫信到公司裏，表示你失望的程度。你惟一的武器，就是看見了電影院不進去，不拿出錢去買票子。攝製家要是拿不到你的角票或洋錢，他們簡直就束乎無策了。</p>
<p>每一張新片出世的時候，攝製家總是中心惴惴，不知道能否博得觀眾們的歡迎否。如果有一位天才的攝製家，能够正確的預卜觀眾們的好惡的話，他早就成了百萬富翁了。所以，現在電影界的鉅頭，能够幾十年來，保持他們不倒的地位的，差不多總是有些天才，或是從歷年的經騐上，得到過相當的教訓的。但是他們，亦不能完全捉摸觀衆們的心理。</p>
<p>觀衆們的好惡，是反覆無常，連觀眾們自己亦不知道的。往往攝製家發現了你所喜歡的什麽，但是因為過於討好的緣故，反而損失了大量的金錢。我們現在可以將歐戰時候的戰事影片講一講。歐戰之中，美國全國人民的眼睛，都集注於歐洲的戰事，幷且大家都痛恨德皇該撒。因此，仇德的戰事影片就風行了一時，那時候，有一張片呌做「柏林的畜生」。當然，那是咒駡該撒的作品，所以尤合乎那個時候一般觀衆的脾胃。好萊塢於是大量地製造這類的戰事影片，其他的影片都擱置起來了。</p>
<p>當然攝攝家發明觀衆們的喜歡看戰事影片，已經費了不少時日，因此，等到他們趕快攝製，歐戰已是將近告終了。當停戰消息宣佈的時候，已攝成的戰事影片，固然已有幾十張，而尚在攝製之中的，確亦不在少數，大約有數百張之多。</p>
<p>但是現在戰事告終了，人心鬆解了，他們亦不再仇視德國了。他們現在所需要的，是忘記戰爭的痛苦，消滅殘殺的痕跡，這種心理的反動是驟然的，但是這一個小小的反覆，却糟塌了攝製家數百萬的投資，因為後來攝成的影片，都不能吸引觀眾了。觀眾萬能，於此更得了一個明証。</p>
<p>過了多少年之後，戰爭的創傷，已經平復了，奚斯帝里亞巳經消失了。一位名導演，金維多（King　Vidor）却又提起了要拍攝一張戰事影片。他讀了一本關乎歐戰故事的小說（Plumes），想將它搬上銀幕。但是一般資本家於痛空思痛之餘，却都不敢嘗試。但是因為金維多堅持著要進行，他們就不得不答應他，於是他們和金維多訂明了，攝製費應守最低的限度，不得超出一張普通的「程序影片」的範圍。他們並且將小說的故事，修改又修改，等到面目全非之後，還要將它的名字更換了，叫做（The　Big　Parade）。</p>
<p>在那個時候，除去金維多之外，大家都沒有預料到那張（The　Big　Parade）的多末偉大。金維多像一位眞藝術家努力工作著。他和一位彭哈雷改編劇本的時候，他們很巧妙的將Tempo）穿挿進去—戰爭的Tempo—用一種鋼琴的音節來節制影片動作的程序。但是除去了這種有意做進去的Tempo之外，其餘的一切美麗，光彩等等，都是攝影塲中偶然發生的。其中最美麗的是男女主角在攝影塲上，嚼口香糖的一幕。（未完）</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3>評「相見恨晚」</h3>
<p>— 尤競</p>
<p>The　Age　of　Innocence　大上海映</p>
<p>被譯作「相見恨晚」的這張影片，在衷惋的空氣上，是頗像這同一男主角約翰鮑爾士主演的「茀姬遺恨」—The　Life　of　Vergie　Winters的。原著者埃迪霍登（Edith　Wharton）對於戀愛的認識與處理的態度，以及他所根據的世界觀，也和後者的原作家魯易司·勃龍飛地（Lonis　Bromfield）差不多。同樣出發於不澈底的戀愛觀，處處顧慮着所謂「正當的，合禮的舉動」，實則對於自己也明知所演出的是頹喪感傷的悲劇。唯其是主觀上囿於陳舊的圈子裏，廿心地在演做悲哀的忍受所以客觀上給人的感應，並不深刻。</p>
<p>片中展開的是一截十九世紀中葉時，紐約世家社會的生活。和別的許多戀愛的事沒有多大差異地在少年律師牛郎與梅小姐的結婚前，闖入一個為世俗習慣束縛而無法擺脫不滿意婚姻的少婦愛倫。後者因為委托牛郎辦理離婚手續，而復轍了少年時的愛情。這兒作者誇張了老祖母—一個極有權戚的貴婦人，對於當時離婚這類的事情，反對甚烈，她強制愛倫必須屈服於禮教。同時又以另一少年對愛倫與牛郎間秘密之宣揚，來強調劇中人無可奈何的處境？這兒用舊的表現法來看時；技術上是相當可以的。</p>
<p>劇情以愛倫的犧牲，牛郎與梅小姐結婚為一大波折，更深入地直瀉到悲劇中去，而以蜜月歸來的堇然愛燄，與愛倫的悄然離去，作為高潮。</p>
<p>全片是以小說的手法演出的，開始於牛郎已經老邁得為人祖父時，在深夜的車中把這創痛的一頁當作故事般地告訴了少年孫兒。末了結束於他景物全非的回憶，與愛倫含淚作別的複印中。</p>
<p>片中悲劇的氣息是頗濃重的。也就因此而失之於沉悶，陰鬱，與呆板。從服裝，步調，行坐，起居，以及「正當的合禮舉動的」接吻，所織成森然的畫面，對於看慣了目前好萊塢型男女生活方式的觀衆，彷彿是一鱒不大配味口的陳酒導演Priiip　Moeller為了避免沉悶而竭力呌女婢來做戲，却是相當的損失。</p>
<p>作為音響效果的音樂，在這兒是頗值得注意的。片中六七次有音樂的地方，除了提琴演奏與結婚的琴音這兩次是劇中的正面應用，隨着卡脫的畫面同來之外，其餘多是在寂靜的畫面所演進到必要時，才適當地用來以盡其效果之能事的。這對於濫用音樂的一些片子，倒是個糾正。</p>
<p>攝影極靜穆和美，光綫也頗能隨着劇情而明朗沉滯。只是中間表現時間過去的幾個霜雹與花葉的卡脫嫌長了些。</p>
<p>演員男的約翰鮑爾士的儀態與動作，以及內心的表現都相當地成功的。女主角愛琳鄧實不够凄艷。倒是演老祖母的Laura　HopeCrews。大見成功。據說她和另外四位配角，都是紐約舞台上的名優。這在他們穩健的作風上是流露着的。</p>
<h3>評「蛇蝎美人」—金城</h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>由於「良宵」的開映，楊小仲先生是以積極的反封建的姿態而開映被人們熱烈推崇了的。這很顯然的當一電影作品相當深刻的批判了現實，而且勇敢的表現了反封建的觀念形態的時候，我們是很容易被作者的熱情所盛動的了。</p>
<p>在不久以前，我們又鑒賞了他的「紅羊豪俠傳」，在這民族危亡的現在，那是一部頗有時代意義的作品，雖然其中還不免包含了些創作方法上的缺點。</p>
<p>在這「蛇蝎美人」作者很明顯的暗示了都市是罪惡的漩渦，當渾厚的靑年農民從農村踏進了都市，而給物質迷惑住了的時候，結果是家破人亡，一切都歸幾滅。這種暗示，我們在美國影片如「田野風月」等影片中，有過不少次同標的接觸。他們常將都市和鄉村對立起來，都市是罪惡的淵藪，而鄉村却是純樸可愛的。因此他們讚美鄉村，咒咀都市，結果使人們從殘酷的都市現實中，對鄉村作美妙的懷想。可是事實上是否如此呢？都市和鄉村在本質上並沒有兩樣，都市的黑暗，固然被人們從道德觀念上去評價它的價值的低賤，同時在鄉村也有不可掩飾的罪惡存在。所謂中世紀的純樸的鄉村，在這二十世紀的時代，已經不復存在的了。</p>
<p>如此說來，「蛇蝎美人」中如此推論，自然只是浮面的觀察。當都市中的罪惡表現得最為明顯的現在，作者只看到了都市是罪惡的漩渦，袛看到女人是和蛇蝎一般的可怕，而對於鄉村却表現着安居樂業，（至少我們看不到那靑年農民為什麼要去都市。）實際上鄉村中有着土豪劣紳以及天災人禍使農村完全破產等等，這些可怕的現象，這些黑暗，作者却沒有絲毫掘發的。</p>
<p>這「蛇蝎美人」假使那够深入一點的話，至少從所謂交際花的美人身上，就可以探討出許多更本質的聯繫，然而這裏却祇看到她沒來由的戲弄着一個年靑力壯的汽車夫。正因為浮面的現象描寫的原故，正因為僅是從道德觀念上出發的原故，於是農民之妻到底「寬恕」了她的丈夫，而農民也沒來由的「寬如」了那蛇蝎美人了。我們並不主張個人的復仇，但是作者教那靑年茫茫然走向何處去呢？這是我們所要問的。至於在農民妻子身上，給與人們無批判的同情，也不免遺留下為封建說教的作用，雖然我們並不認為那是意識的表現。</p>
<p>正如作者在「自白」中說，「這部戲是注重在情緒的充實……」，在內心描寫方面，有着若干成功的表現。然而就全部的表現技術來說，並沒有將內容充份的表現出來。最主要的是累贅，繁亂，不能更緊凑明快的介紹劇中人物，如張翼到公館給一男子認為是他的替身，如張翼搬家時被人們預言沒有好結果，都是如所謂「標語口號」一般的奇突的說教。假使本片再經過一番很好的整理的話，至少可以省去許多膠）。至於速度的過慢等等，到是其次的缺點。他如汽車夫之子死於非命，不將被軋傷的原因畫而化，接着張翼回家也還是那麽慢慢的，都足以說明導演在織接法方面的失當。因此梁賽珍和張翼二位的演技，有的塲面甚佳，有的却是十分生硬了。</p>
<p>作者在自白中說得好，「……但唱高調，內容空虛，使全劇的情節，成為口號標語的背景，這是一種損失。」這由於不能將積極的內容電影藝術的表現出來，因而所留下的紙是口號，而不是藝術。但是我們却不能如軟性紳士一樣的將藝術價值和社會價值對立，正確的而且是藝術的地深刻的描寫現實，自然有其極高的社會評價。這一解釋，不知作者以為如何？同時，正因為作者是誠懇的接收一切嚴正批評的，所以誠懇的和作者商榷如上。</p>
<p>電影小說</p>
<h3>威靈登軼事（The　Lron　Duke）（二）</h3>
<p>— 信之</p>
<p>那是路易十世的姪女，瑪麗安東尼的女兒，安諾勒姆公爵夫人。她是一位聰明狡獪的婦人。她全身充塞了波邦族的血，一心一意地想為她被殺的母親復仇。她又痛恨那一般聯合起來，驅逐拿破崙出國的人，因為他們的功績，却無形中顯示了波邦族人的闇弱無能。</p>
<p>但她的厭惡威靈登，却尤不在此點：她恨他，因為他是扶植她的伯父做法國皇帝的人，他的勢力比她的還大。所以現在威靈登公爵，坐在維也納會議桌上的時候，他並不是想念那些君主王候，而是想到了這一位足智多謀的女子（她的形狀時時蕩漾於他的腦海之中，却是歐洲前途和平最大的一個障碍。</p>
<p>這個時候，普王還在咆哮着道：「普魯士一定要得到荷蘭和上露蘭的土地，才可以保全普魯士的安全……」忽然一個膽小的，而無血色的秘書，用足尖走着路，跑到威靈登的身旁，將一張折好的紙交給了他，仍舊躡着足，毫無聲息的走了出去。大家還在爭吵着，一回兒是俄羅斯的使臣們，一回兒是普魯士王，都是無底止，無結果的紛呶。惟有威靈登獨自一個人坐着不動聲色。他徐徐將那張紙打了開來。</p>
<p>麥泰湼忽然不耐煩似的道：「我們一定要想出一定的辦法出來，不能永遠這樣爭持着」。他說完了，然後對着威靈登公爵道：「公爵，你有什麽意見呢」？威餵登公爵帶着譏諷的語氣道：「我想，這隻獅子的皮還不够大」。</p>
<p>他說了這句話大家都默不作聲了，面面相覻蒲，覺得受了無情的譏刺，但事實又是確然如此，使他們有發作不了的憤怒。可是威靈登却管不了他們的羞惱，他正在看剛才收到的那張紙條呢。他看了，忽然怒形於色的突然站了起來，他的憤怒又轉成了一種夷然不屑的神氣說道：「我再加一句。這隻獅子的皮，並且分得太早了。他還沒有死哩。拿破崙從厄爾巴逃出來了」！</p>
<p>他一說，一面將眼光掃射着會議桌上的一般人。大家聽了，好像晴天起了一個霹靂，大家都默然不響了半天，細細琢磨着這個消息的重要意味……拿破崙出了樊籠！回到了故鄉法國，長驅直入的向着巴黎前進！</p>
<p>泰勒蘭頭一個復了他的喉嚨。他對着威靈登道：「他一定要先到瑞士」。威靈登道：「他己在向巴黎前進了！泰勒蘭先生，請你立即通知路易王，叫他立即離開巴黎。讓他到琴脫去，帶了他的家屬回去」。泰勒蘭聽見威靈登提到路易王的家屬，不覺笑了一笑，可是感靈登又說道：「但是不帶他們去更好」。</p>
<p>他說完了，就對着會議桌上的許多人道：「這個會議，現在已告終止。等到我們再打敗了拿破崙之後，再重新召集，不過那不是五分鐘之內，可以辦得到的」。其中一個代表發言道：「我們亦不用愁聽。他儘管再來，可是他己經沒有軍隊了」。威靈登道：「軍隊？他們從各拔，各鎭，各鄉村，都會奔馳着去投効他的。他祇要噓一下子，他們都來了。那人不服道：「他拿什麼東西給他們呢」？威靈登乾笑道：「土地。你不要忘記了。土地會經一度在他的掌握之中的」。　（未完）</p>

Do not drive the people to become bandits, so as not to harm the country in the future. Moreover, the country is currently facing great difficulties and needs the cooperation of the military and the people.

<h3>Conflict Between People of Xiaoxian and Suxian; Tongxiao Counties Jointly Dredge Kui River; Suxian People Oppose and Launch Armed Cross-Border Attack; Serious Standoff Between the Two Sides</h3>
<p>Xuzhou. The Kui River is a major river in Xuzhou and flows south into Anhui Province. Tongxiao Counties decided to jointly dredge it this spring to develop water conservancy. Construction began in the Xiaoxian area on the 3rd, and dredging in the Tongxian area is scheduled to begin on the 8th. Unexpectedly, the people of Suxian opposed it and, on the evening of the 4th, gathered an armed force to launch a cross-border attack on the people dredging the river in Xiaoxian. The people of Xiaoxian also gathered to resist. The two sides engaged in fierce fighting for a day and night, only ceasing on the evening of the 5th. The people of Xiaoxian drove the armed forces of Suxian out of the area, and both sides suffered casualties. Currently, the people of Suxian are gathering in Shixiang Town, while the people of Xiaoxian are gathering in Anlou. The situation is still serious.

Shao Hanyuan, the commissioner of the Tong District, also intends to go to supervise the river works. The people of Tongxiao believe that dredging the Kui River is related to disaster prevention and are determined to thoroughly dredge it without stopping. Qu Zhuxun, the county magistrate of Suxian, sent a telegram inviting County Magistrate Wang to meet at Fenghuangkou to discuss everything. Wang declined, replying that he could not leave the area without provincial orders. According to water conservancy experts, the people of Suxian should urgently join in dredging, and refusing to dredge is not a solution. (6th Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Relief for Inflation and Panic</h3>
<p>— Ren</p>
<p>Since our country levied taxes on silver exports, the topic of inflation has become common chatter on the streets. Recently, the Chinese National Federation of Industries has established a special economic committee to study the implementation plan for inflation, aiming to alleviate the current panic. Once a concrete plan is discussed, it will be submitted to the government. From this, it can be seen that this topic has become the focus of discussion among industrial and commercial groups. Whether the results of their discussions will be adopted by the government in the future is still uncertain at present. However, their spirit of independent research is admirable.</p>
<p>However, if we want to use inflation to solve China's economic panic, then we have some things to say about the causes of the panic. China's current industrial and commercial panic, judging by the time of its outbreak, occurred before the financial panic and after the agricultural panic. This clearly shows that the reason for the current business depression and the decline of national industries is the bankruptcy of rural areas and the disappearance of the purchasing power of the majority of the people. In addition, the influx of cheap foreign goods has narrowed China's market. Most of this narrow market is filled with foreign goods. In other words, most of the remaining purchasing power in China today has been plundered by foreign goods. Under these circumstances, the outbreak of crisis in Chinese industry and commerce is inevitable. As for the separation of financial capital from industrial capital, it is merely an accelerator of the industrial and commercial panic, but not the fundamental cause of it. Therefore, if we want to solve the industrial and commercial panic, we must start with improving the rural areas.</p>
<p>As for the expansion of currency, whether in theory or in fact, it can raise prices. Therefore, those who believe that the current industrial and commercial panic is due to the lack of market financial chips for turnover mostly believe that expanding the currency is the only way to alleviate the industrial and commercial panic. This argument can be justified in today's situation where silver is flowing out and the market currency is shrinking due to insufficient chips. However, how can we explain the panic during the past period of cheap silver and expensive gold? Insufficient chips are just a temporary phenomenon and not the fundamental cause of China's panic. The root cause of China's panic is the disappearance of the purchasing power of the majority of the people. The so-called disappearance of purchasing power does not mean that the amount of currency is insufficient, but that currency cannot be obtained. Therefore, if the purchasing power cannot be restored, even if the currency is expanded ten or a hundred times more than it is today, the result will only increase the amount of currency and reduce the value of the currency. It is true that the increase in the amount of currency can lead to higher prices, and most of the farmers in the country can earn more money due to the rise in agricultural products. However, on the other hand, won't farmers still spend more money due to the rise in general prices? If there is more income and more expenditure, how will the future purchasing power be any different from the purchasing power today?</p>
<p>Therefore, in today's world, the most fundamental way to solve the economic panic is to find a way to make the majority of Chinese farmers "earn more than they spend." Furthermore, this portion of "earning more than they spend" should not be seized by foreign goods and should increase the purchasing power of farmers. If this fundamental problem can be solved, then all panics can be alleviated. If only superficial symptoms are treated without addressing the root cause, one wave will inevitably follow another, which is not a permanent solution. The policy of inflation is often "easy to start and difficult to end." If it is not thoroughly planned and carefully considered, its implementation will not only be ineffective, but may also cause hardship to society and the country. Even if it is implemented without any drawbacks, it is definitely not a fundamental solution to alleviate the panic. This is something that the Chinese people must not fail to realize.</p>
<p>In short, we must see clearly, recognize the truth, be down-to-earth, and move forward bravely in everything. When it comes to economic organization, what must be thoroughly reformed should be thoroughly reformed. If it can be partially improved, then partial improvement may be considered. With a spirit of "fearlessness" and a very "scientific" attitude, holding a scalpel in one hand and a suture needle in the other, cut what should be cut and mend what should be mended. Only then will there be hope and possibility of removing the root cause of the panic.</p>
<h3>### Hirota Answers Questions from Assemblymen, Explains Sino-Japanese Relations, Promotes Goodwill Through Heart-to-Heart Communication</h3>
<p>Tokyo – Tanaka Takeo questioned the China issue in the House of Representatives meeting on the 5th. Foreign Minister Hirota responded as follows: In the future, to improve Sino-Japanese relations, a heart-to-heart approach is more important than forcibly considering concrete methods aimed at goodwill. There are widespread rumors about the opinions of the UK and the US on Sino-Japanese issues, but these are just the opinions of a few critics. It should not be hastily concluded that they represent the overall opinion or trend of the UK or the US. Based on my impressions from directly meeting with representatives of the UK and the US in my capacity as Foreign Minister, the UK and the US definitely do not hold skeptical attitudes or objections to the issue of Sino-Japanese rapprochement. However, because the UK and the US have close trade relations with China, they strongly hope that China will develop its political and economic capabilities. Japan also wants to conduct research on this issue with the UK, the US, and others. (Jiji News Agency, 6th)</p>
<h3>### Opinions from Japanese Financial Circles: Use Goods as Currency in the Form of Loans</h3>
<p>Tokyo – The opinions of Japanese financial circles regarding Sino-Japanese economic cooperation are as follows: Sino-Japanese economic cooperation is the most important issue from the standpoint of Sino-Japanese coexistence and co-prosperity. However, unless China ceases its anti-Japanese goods movement, Japan should not take the initiative to propose the loan issue. If the Chinese side requests a loan from Japan, then it should be in the form of goods rather than currency. The so-called goods loan means that Japan exports industrial products such as machinery and equipment in the form of loans, and China imports cotton and other raw materials as repayment. This method can boost Japanese industry and at the same time develop China's raw material exports to Japan, increase its purchasing power, and improve China's cultural standards.

<h3>### Contents of the UK-US Talks: Japanese Ambassador Saito Reports to His Country</h3>

Philip replied that the US silver policy had domestic reasons and could not be changed overnight. They also discussed the issue of financial aid to China. (Jiji News Agency, 6th)</p>
<h3>### International Loan Issue: British Ambassador States They are Currently in Contact with Our Side</h3>
<p>Beijing – The British Embassy issued the following statement today: "In view of the inaccuracies of the rumors, this embassy specifically declares that the British government has not proposed providing aid to China in the form of loans. The only fact is that, in light of China's recent financial panic, the Chinese and British governments have exchanged opinions with each other. The British government is willing to see China obtain this loan to resolve its financial difficulties. However, the British government currently believes that this matter must first be discussed with other relevant countries. Therefore, it has notified the relevant countries of its talks with the Chinese government and hopes that the relevant countries will express their opinions on any substantive proposals." (National News Agency, 6th)</p>
<p>Beijing – British Minister Sir Alexander Cadogan, in a separate meeting with an Associated Press reporter today, made the following remarks regarding the negotiations between Britain and China on the "20 Million Pound International Loan Issue": "At China's repeated requests, we are currently negotiating the establishment of a 20 million pound international credit system. Although its success is not yet certain, it is necessary to have a clear understanding that it will not hinder Sino-Japanese cooperation. Sino-Japanese friendship is the greatest condition for loans to China and peace in the Far East. We do not deem it necessary to attach conditions to this loan that would protect the future interests of Britain or other countries. Regardless of whether the loan is granted, we will take appropriate measures to protect ourselves. China initially proposed the loan to Britain several months ago, but the negotiations are still in the first stage and have not progressed. This is because Britain does not believe that acting alone on this loan is a wise move. Furthermore, Treasury regulations prohibit the government from providing funds to countries that are not on the gold standard. Therefore, we do not want this debt to be individual and want to proceed under joint assistance. From this perspective, a hesitant attitude is naturally adopted. I have not heard that Japan formally opposes joint aid to China. As a result of my consultations with various countries, I have notified a certain key figure in the Nanjing government. The Nanjing government is considering the effective and appropriate use of the loan, as well as methods to guarantee it. Therefore, concrete proposals are expected in the coming days. I can only wait for the Chinese side to express its will." (Dentsu News Agency, 6th)</p>
<p>London – Responsible parties declared today that the request made by Britain to the US, Japan, and France, and the proposal for international financial assistance to China, are all intended to ease the tense political situation in the Far East. (National News Agency, 5th)</p>
<p>London – During a meeting in the House of Commons today, Conservative MP Lenn asked about the loan to China, and asked whether it was intended to be provided by a banking consortium. Foreign Secretary Simon replied that a concrete proposal for a loan to China was made last December, but after careful consideration, the government felt that this move would not help the overall situation. The government is now closely monitoring China's financial situation and attaches great importance to cooperation among the major powers most relevant to it, including China. The government has discussed this matter with other countries, one of which is the United States. At this point, Conservative MP Lady Astor interjected with a smile, saying, "Sir Simon, is the commitment to China somewhat looser than our commitment to Germany in the past few days?" This was a clear reference to the White Paper on national defense. The Foreign Secretary did not respond to this and continued to answer Lenn's question, saying that the plan for a loan to China had not been formally submitted to the government, so the second half of Lenn's question did not arise. (Reuters, 6th)</p>
<h3>### US Silver Policy Unchanged</h3>
<p>Washington – A spokesperson for the Treasury Department declared to an Associated Press reporter today that the US silver policy remains unchanged. Secretary of State Hull declared that he has not recently discussed with anyone the issue of changing the US silver policy to benefit China. However, it is noteworthy that the amount of silver imported in the past two bi-weekly periods has decreased significantly, indicating that the United States is only purchasing enough silver in the international market to avoid silver-producing countries from opposing during international discussions on financial aid to China. (National News Agency, 5th)</p>
<p>Paris – According to news obtained by a correspondent in New York from the Economic and Financial Communications Agency, the United States is willing to lend money to China to stabilize its currency and replenish its exchange equalization fund. The US Treasury Department has assured China that the silver policy has a significant impact on the Shanghai market and is now willing to work to reduce its pressure as a win-win solution. (Havas, 6th)</p>
<h3>### Lytton Expresses Views on Sino-Japanese Cooperation</h3>
<p>London – Lord Lytton, the leader of the League of Nations investigation team sent to Manchuria in 1932, expressed his views today when asked by a Reuters reporter about Sino-Japanese cooperation, saying, "I am confident that the moderate faction in Japan understands the need for a frank and sincere resolution with China. I believe that members of the Japanese military, if properly persuaded, will also agree with this view. Because their position, on the one hand, is Manchuria, where people are resentful, and on the other hand, China, where hostility is strong, will inevitably make the Japanese military anxious and uneasy. There is currently no country restraining China's issues. China is vast, and the powers have plenty of room to operate China's trade separately, without having to be jealous of each other. I have never supported biased attacks on Japan, because such actions only prevent the Japanese from cooperating with the rest of the world. Unfortunately, the League of Nations passed a censure resolution against Japan without taking any other action. The way to approach them is not to criticize, but to make efforts with a friendly spirit and seek an agreement that can be recognized by all parties and eliminate suspicion in the Far East. The world wants Japan to return to the League of Nations, but if the Far East problem cannot be resolved, the League of Nations may disappear without a trace. Regarding China, the first priority now is to restore its seat on the League of Nations Council. I hope this can be done. China's currency is in serious condition due to rising silver prices, so financial assistance is necessary. The only way to assist China seems to be through international loans, and Japan may not be able to bear this huge amount of money alone. Assistance from the United States is needed to solve the Far East problem." (Reuters, 6th)</p>

<h3>### Negotiations on Japanese-Russian Pending Issues: Fundamental Issues Remain Divided</h3>
<p>Tokyo – Regarding the dispute between Japan and Russia over the fishing area bidding issue, the Russian currency exchange rate has been resolved at 3.25%, as requested by Japan. Negotiations between Japan and Russia have progressed further. The Russian ambassador has been very busy with exchanges with the Japanese side in recent days. According to the Japanese side, the progress of negotiations on various pending issues is as follows: (1) The Japanese-Russian "Manchukuo" border committee case: Japan has raised this issue to Russia several times since 1933. Russia has recently agreed to establish such a committee. (2) The issue of revising the Russian fishing treaty: Japan will submit a concrete proposal, which includes issues such as exchange rates, regulation of distant fishing, preservation of fish stocks, and stability of fishing areas. The original proposal was taken to Moscow by Ambassador Ota at the end of March. (3) The issue of extending the Sakhalin oil rights: Russia still insists on disagreeing. Representatives of Japanese civilians are negotiating in the Russian capital. (4) The issues of abolishing defenses and non-aggression treaties are the most difficult issues for the two countries to resolve. Foreign Minister Hirota initially raised the issue of demilitarized zones, but the military believed that it did not meet current military requirements. It instead requested Russia to abolish its military equipment in the Russian Far East and still agreed to discuss the non-aggression treaty after the pending issues were resolved. The two sides are far apart. (China United Press, 6th)</p>

<h3>UK Naval Budget Increases Sharply: Shipbuilding Program Accelerated: Singapore Naval Base Expected to Be Completed Soon: New Submarine Squadron Stationed in Our Territorial Waters</h3>
<p>London – The 1935 naval budget estimate provides a total of £60,050,000 for naval expenses, an increase of £3,500,000 compared to last year, and the number of naval personnel will also increase by 2,000. This funding includes £2,553,600 for fleet maintenance, specifically for major repairs and new reforms of capital ships and the organization of national defense equipment. It also includes an additional £535,000 for naval aircraft expenses and £1,145,196 for the construction program. The program stipulates the construction of three cruisers, one leader ship, eight destroyers, 21 submarines, one submarine supply ship, four supply ships, one survey ship, and seven small warships. The reason for the increase of 2,000 sailors is that old ships need to be replenished and naval aircraft squadrons need to be expanded. Naval Minister Monsell issued a statement today, saying that the construction of new cruisers, destroyers, and submarines will still be governed by the London Naval Treaty until the end of December 1936. According to this treaty, the United Kingdom can build new ships to compensate for one cruiser and submarine exceeding the age limit by the end of 1939, and destroyers exceeding the age limit by the end of 1938. The British government did not forget this restriction when deciding on the 1935 naval shipbuilding program. The number of cruisers has not increased or decreased. Since the implementation of the London Naval Treaty, the fourth cruiser listed in the 1921 program, which was moved into the 1934 program, was built for Australia to replace the old cruiser Brisbane. This method has now been implemented. The number of new destroyers and submarines stipulated in the 1935 estimate is consistent with the number stipulated in the years after the implementation of the London Naval Treaty. The statement included a note explaining the British warships were equipped with equipment to increase efficiency, such as speed change and distance recorders, echo sounders, and each submarine was equipped with Davis escape equipment, etc. The statement also stated that three submarines would be added to the Chinese maritime submarine squadron because several submarines in China were about to be repaired. Therefore, new large cruisers will be concentrated in China, so that the organization can be simplified and maintenance costs can be saved. (Reuters, 6th)</p>
<p>London – According to the figures announced by Naval Minister Monsell today, the British naval budget for this year is £60,050,000, an increase of £3.5 million compared to the 1934 budget. When Monsell announced the budget, he also released a memorandum stating that the increased funds would be used to increase the number of naval personnel by 2,000. As for the new shipbuilding plan, it is still subject to the restrictions of the London Naval Treaty until 1937. Monsell limited the 1935 naval shipbuilding plan as follows: three Southampton-class cruisers, one leader destroyer, eight destroyers, three submarines, one for burying torpedoes, one for ordinary submarines, and one for cruising submarines, one submarine storage ship, four small gunboats, three of which are anti-torpedo boats, and the other one is an escort ship, and seven small boats. The increase in the naval budget, along with the sharp increase in army and air force expenditures, makes this year's military budget more than 10 million pounds higher than in previous years. Monsell also said that 26 capital ships and cruisers have now been equipped with decks, housing 33 aircraft. The progress of the Singapore project is satisfactory and is expected to be completed in the spring of 1939. As for the large dock, it can be completed in September 1937.

<h3>British Air Minister Explains: Plans to Strengthen the Air Force: The Speed of Progress in the Coming Year Will Depend on the International Situation: Particular Emphasis on Far East Aviation Exercises</h3>
<p>London – The British Air Force's program has the flexibility to adjust its speed of progress according to the needs of the international situation. The explanatory memorandum on the Air Force budget estimate released by the Air Minister today explained this point, stating that the estimate increased by £3,089,000, for a total of £20,650,000. The progress of foreign air forces is very rapid, and the United Kingdom has no choice but to expand it. Therefore, the government has made this decision. The Air Force will continue to practice flying from Egypt to India, from Iraq to Singapore, and from Singapore to India, and plans to use land aircraft to go to South Africa. As for the plan to establish a branch line in the British West African colonies, with weekly flights to connect with the main line of Cape Town, South Africa, is also under consideration. The most important thing at present is the ground preparation for the British Empire Air Line to facilitate the take-off and landing of various aircraft day and night and to help realize the Empire's transportation industry.

<p>Labor Party Expresses Opposition London – After the government issued a white paper explaining the reasons for increasing military expenditure, many Labor Party members in the House of Commons believed that this move was tantamount to throwing a torpedo at the disarmament conference and planned to ask the chairman of the disarmament conference, Henderson, to resign from his post to show their protest. The members will also introduce a motion in the House of Commons next Monday to impeach the government's rearmament policy, but it is generally believed that they will decide how to word the motion after hearing Henderson's own opinion. (Havas, 6th)</p>
<p>Government Bonds Plummet London – After seeing the White Paper on national defense, the London financial community felt that Britain's military expenditure would increase greatly, and there was no hope of reducing taxes in the next budget. Therefore, government bonds plummeted today, and the popularity of various markets was also bleak. (Reuters, 6th)</p>
<p>The United States Does Not Criticize London – Senior US officials believe that the increase in British defense expenditure is entirely related to Britain's own interests and therefore do not criticize it. However, the general opinion in political circles is that the increase in British defense expenditure is only about 10 percent, which is not excessive. Recently, the US government has released a budget that greatly increases the expenditure on the army and air force, and the national defense standard it maintains in peacetime has reached an unprecedented height.

<h3>Italian Naval Power</h3>
<p>Rome: The Italian naval fleet consists of the following ships: four armored ships of 32,000 tons each; seven cruisers of 10,000 tons each, which were commissioned between 1927 and 1933; twelve "Condottieri" class cruisers, half of which were commissioned between 1930 and 1932, with the other half currently under construction; seven old-style cruisers; twenty-seven scout ships; thirty-six torpedo boats, of which sixteen are of the latest type; thirty-five old-style torpedo boats of 600 tons each, and six new ones; forty submarine destroyers; seventy-five submarines, of which fifty-four are new; three mine-laying ships. In addition, there are two large battleships of 35,000 tons each, one being the Littorio and the other the Vittorio Veneto, both under construction, and 146 auxiliary ships, namely training ships and tugboats. There are also as many as 150 small vessels serving in various ports. (Havas, 6th)</p>
<h3>Hitler's "Diplomatic" Illness: Simon's Visit to Germany Postponed Indefinitely; The British White Paper Offends Germany, Affecting the Development of the European Situation</h3>
<p>Berlin: Foreigners here now believe that Hitler's suffering from a cold is actually an excuse to stall the arrival of British Foreign Secretary Simon, because the British White Paper on defense issues, which involves Germany's rearmament, has greatly offended the German authorities. Simon was originally scheduled to depart with Eden for Berlin on Thursday, but this has now been postponed indefinitely. According to a German Foreign Ministry spokesman speaking to Reuters today, the date of the British Foreign Secretary's visit to Germany may be rescheduled, but everything depends on the state of health of the Führer.</p>
<p>Hitler met with his disarmament envoy Ribbentrop for two hours today, and they certainly discussed the British White Paper. After learning the content of the British White Paper, Hitler convened a meeting of senior officials at the Reich Chancellery last night. This morning, Hitler personally decided to ask British Foreign Secretary Simon to postpone his visit to Germany, and Foreign Minister Neurath agreed. Subsequently, the following communiqué was issued: The Führer caught a slight cold while visiting Saarbrücken and lost his voice. He is now following the doctor's advice and canceling talks scheduled for the near future to rest his voice. Therefore, the German government, through the Foreign Minister, notified the British Ambassador, requesting the British cabinet to postpone their visit to Germany. The British government has replied to the German Foreign Ministry, saying that they are very concerned to hear of the German Führer's indisposition and deeply hope for his speedy recovery. (Reuters, 5th)</p>
<p>Berlin: Political and diplomatic circles here were shocked to hear that Hitler suddenly felt unwell, causing British Foreign Secretary Simon to postpone his visit to Germany. The public, however, is indifferent to the Führer's illness. An official communiqué stated only that Mr. Hitler caught a cold in Saarbrücken the other day, resulting in a hoarse voice. People often say that Hitler's throat was badly damaged by poison gas in the European War, causing him to lose his voice from time to time. It is said that he did indeed catch a cold last Friday during his visit to the Saar region because he did not take care of himself, so it is not a "diplomatic" illness. It should be noted that Foreign Secretary Simon's visit to Germany was at Germany's request, with sincerity and earnest words. Without a serious reason, they would never go back on their word and request Simon to postpone his trip. According to reliable sources, Hitler has been handling political affairs continuously in recent days, meeting with many important figures until midnight last night. This afternoon, he also met with Ribbentrop, the special representative for disarmament issues, for over two hours, which shows that the illness is for a reason. Political circles believe that Hitler's illness is of great importance, because the postponement of the British cabinet's visit will delay diplomatic negotiations between major European powers, and the development of the European situation will inevitably be affected. (Havas, 5th)</p>
<h3>German Newspapers Criticize Intercourse and Conjunction</h3>
<p>Berlin: Tonight, German newspapers deliberately avoided linking the British government's publication of the White Paper on defense issues with Hitler's sudden announcement of illness and request for British Foreign Secretary Simon to postpone his visit to Germany. They only expressed Germany's regret regarding the British White Paper. The Deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung said that the British White Paper, which criticizes Germany's rearmament, actually hinders European coordination policies. It is strange that the British government has taken this "unfriendly action." It is said that Britain once suffered from war mania last November, and now the old disease has recurred. The Berliner Börsen-Zeitung said that the British government's resentment only proves the necessity of Germany's rearmament. It should be known that German youth grow up in an environment of national spirit and have nothing to do with military training. Germany's neighbors have been subjecting their youth to military training for many years, while Germany has not. Conversely, the Berliner Tageblatt seems to have a considerable understanding of the British point of view, saying that all attempts at peaceful organization result in ever more intense war preparations, so Germany's rearmament is even more necessary. However, Der Angriff placed the headlines of the British White Paper and the postponement of Foreign Secretary Simon's visit to Germany in the same place. (Havas, 5th)</p>
<h3>Comments from British and French Newspapers</h3>
<p>London: The Daily Telegraph commented on the postponement of Foreign Secretary Simon's visit to Germany, saying that they hope Hitler will recover quickly so that diplomatic negotiations can continue. It also said, "The British government's view of the true state of international affairs is probably not fully understood by German officials, as evidenced by the reaction in Germany after the publication of the British White Paper." The Morning Post's tone was the same as the Daily Telegraph's, saying, "Talks between Britain and Germany have now encountered obstacles. We sincerely hope that these talks are only postponed and not definitely canceled. The British government, before its cabinet members went to Germany, frankly explained its views on the international situation in the White Paper, which should have been welcomed by Hitler, as it would have made it easier to dispel any doubts in the British view." In addition, opposition newspapers criticized the White Paper, saying that the reason for Foreign Secretary Simon's postponement of his visit to Germany was precisely this. Among them, the Daily Herald, the organ of the Labour Party, stated, "Regardless of others' opinions of the British government's policy towards Germany, the publication of the White Paper on the eve of Foreign Secretary Simon's departure for Germany was a huge mistake. In the future, the foundation for talks between Britain and Germany may need to be rebuilt." (Havas, 6th)</p>
<p>Paris: Newspapers commented extensively on the postponement of the Anglo-German talks, believing that the reason why German Führer Hitler requested Foreign Secretary Simon to postpone his visit to Germany was due to the British government's publication of the White Paper, which declared the necessity of strengthening armaments. The newspapers also said that the statement that the borders between Britain and Germany are now on the Rhine is even more credible. However, Foreign Secretary Simon's proposed visits to Moscow and Warsaw have also been greatly affected by this. Le Journal stated, "Führer Hitler originally believed that Part V of the Treaty of Versailles, the military clauses, had expired and that Britain would have no objection, so Germany could rearm at will. Now the British White Paper has actually criticized this, which is a reversal of fortune. This is why Führer Hitler's indignation is seen in his words, and he wants to use the British government's opposition party as a means of self-preservation." Le Matin stated, "After Germany rearms, Britain has its own reasons to take precautionary measures militarily to safeguard the security of the empire." L'Intransigeant stated, "Germany originally wanted to use Anglo-German talks to alienate Britain and France. After failing, it may propose to France to start Franco-German talks, hoping to isolate Britain." Le Figaro stated, "Germany now wants to use Britain's internal affairs to achieve its speculative intentions and wait for the results of the debate on the military budget in the British House of Commons on March 11 as a means of taking advantage. Hitler hopes that the opposition party can make things difficult for the British government." (Havas, 6th)</p>
<h3>Hungary: Signs of Fascism, Parliament Suddenly Dissolved, General Election Next Month</h3>
<p>Budapest: The House of Representatives met today and announced its dissolution, which lasted only seven minutes. First, the new Prime Minister Gömbös presented a secret sealed document to the Speaker to be read. Its contents were a list of the new cabinet members. After the Speaker finished reading, the Prime Minister took out another document from his pocket and handed it to the Speaker to read, and it was then known that the government had ordered the dissolution of the House of Representatives.</p>
<p>Budapest: Gömbös's resolute action to dissolve Parliament is generally seen as a sign of the formation of a united front by right-wing parties. Among them, the Christian Social Party led by Gömbös and the Smallholder's Party led by Eckhardt are the mainstays. This group aims to make Hungary fascist in order to resist Marxism and liberalism. The group led by former Prime Minister Bethlen has formed a constitutionalist faction to resist Gömbös and has pointed out that Gömbös's actions are incompatible with Hungary's political system of more than a thousand years. The monarchist leader Bellawicz, who is famous for opposing German forces, said that Gömbös's actions are to promote Hitler's doctrines in Hungary, and all those who cherish constitutionalism are working hard to oppose it.

<h3>Greek National Army Concentrates its Forces to Attack; the Rebel Party's Situation is Difficult to Sustain; the Ultimatum Expired Yesterday Afternoon; the Eastern Macedonian Army and Air Force Display Great Power</h3>
<p>Yugoslav Capital: The ultimatum issued by Greek Minister of the Army Kondylis to the rebels expired at noon today. If the rebels have not surrendered by then, the Greek government forces and the rebels will begin fighting in eastern Macedonia today in the afternoon. Minister of the Army Kondylis intends to concentrate military forces to tighten the encirclement of the rebels, so as to avoid excessive bloodshed and force the rebels to surrender. It is generally expected that the government forces will win, because the rebels rely entirely on supplies from Crete. However, the rebel ships in Crete are moving very slowly due to lack of fuel and have not yet reached the Macedonian coast occupied by the rebels. Without supplies, the rebel army's momentum is difficult to sustain. It is said that domestic public opinion in Greece is clearly against the rebel leader, former Prime Minister Venizelos, and many Greek youths are now enlisting in the government army to help eliminate the rebels. (Havas, 6th)</p>
<p>Athens: The Greek rebellion seems to be on the verge of collapse. According to government sources, the land rebels can be subdued in less than two days. The authorities are now using aircraft to quell the rebellion, as it is the most effective. Yesterday, both the rebel army and the rebel warships were attacked from the air. Last night, the government army won a great victory in eastern Macedonia. Bombardiers and loyal and brave troops, under the personal command of General Kondylis, fiercely attacked the rebel army in the Salonica-Struma area and defeated them greatly. The rebel army initially resisted stubbornly, but soon collapsed under machine gun and field artillery fire, abandoning many dead and wounded. The rebel army has crossed the Struma River and reached Serres, but the government army from Salonica and other places has been closely pursuing them since this morning. The morale of the rebel army commanded by General Kamenos is very low. Yesterday, aircraft dropped leaflets on the army, saying that the government is well aware that you are forced to fight by the rebellious officers, who do not tell you the truth. You should quickly repent and surrender, so that you can avoid being pursued. The government today stated that all islands except Crete are loyal to the government. The air force is now focusing its bombing on Crete. Shops in towns such as Athens and Salonica have reopened, which shows that the overall situation has turned for the better. The government has temporarily banned private commercial aircraft from landing in Greece. (Reuters, 6th)</p>
<p>Athens Resembles a Dead City: Paris: According to a passenger on an Imperial Airways flying boat that arrived in Alexandria today, the current state of Athens and Piraeus is that the two places have become dead cities, and it is difficult to see a single pedestrian on the road. At the same time, according to a Reuters correspondent in Athens, the Greek government today announced special laws to confiscate all the property of the rebel party. The Minister of the Army issued an ultimatum today, calling on the rebel party to surrender as soon as possible to avoid continued bloodshed. Prime Minister Tsaldaris issued a statement today, saying that from today onwards, the action to suppress the rebel party has taken a major turn for the better, and the government's victory is assured. Moreover, after this battle, it can be done once and for all. Yesterday's battle against the rebel masses was entirely aerial bombardment, because it was the winter season, and the weather was extremely cold, which was not conducive to the use of other weapons. (Havas)</p>
<p>Minister of the Army Urges the Rebel Army to Surrender: Today, Minister of the Army General Kondylis issued a proclamation, urging the soldiers and junior officers of the Macedonian rebel army to surrender together. It stated, "The government has now mobilized four classes of army reserves, totaling 100,000 people. In addition, there are 60 aircraft and many artillery pieces, which will be used to suppress them with all their strength. I would not hesitate to order the army to completely annihilate you. However, I sincerely hope that fratricidal strife can be avoided, and you have all been incited by Venizelos, who is harming the country and the people, and his crimes are unforgivable. He will inevitably abandon you and flee abroad soon. Do not be fooled by him. Now that the government's army is gathered in eastern Macedonia, before formally opening fire, I would like to give you a final warning, and each of you should abide by the oath you have sworn, bring your weapons and return, so as to jointly defend the highest interests of the motherland and the freedom of the Greek people. As for this rebellion, Venizelos should be held responsible, and those who return from the rebel army will not be implicated. Let each of you take heed," and so on. (Havas, 5th)</p>

<p>The Liberal Party Opposes Civil War: Athens: The government has ordered a ban on any foreign aircraft flying over Greek territory. According to reports from Macedonia, the fighting between the government army and the rebels has been delayed due to heavy rain and dense fog. Liberal Party leader, former Prime Minister Michalakopoulos, made a statement to the press, disapproving of the rebellion and advising former Prime Minister Venizelos to prioritize patriotism and avoid civil war. It is the first time that a Liberal Party figure has made a public declaration opposing the rebellion.

<p>Turkey Increases Troops on the Border: Bulgarian Capital: Due to the spread of the Greek turmoil, which may endanger Bulgaria, Foreign Minister Batalla reported to reporters today that the Bulgarian government has increased its border defenses. This step is entirely for the sake of maintaining peace in the Balkans and has absolutely no desire to take advantage of the situation to gain anything. Mr. Bai also said that Turkey is currently concentrating troops on the border with Bulgaria, and the purpose is incomprehensible. He only hopes that Turkey's move is not aimed at Bulgaria, because Bulgaria has not provoked Turkey in the slightest. (National Telegram, 5th)</p>

<h3>The French Government Decides to Maintain the Gold Standard; the United States Remains Calm About Exchange Rate Fluctuations; It Will Allow Gold to be Re-exported at an Appropriate Time</h3>
<p>Paris: After Prime Minister Flandin firmly declared that France does not intend to lower the price of the franc, he won a majority of 333 votes to 154 in the Chamber of Deputies today. The Prime Minister not only resolutely stated that the government is determined to maintain the franc, but also said that it has never considered changing its monetary policy. Mr. Flandin told the Chamber of Deputies, "The government has paid close attention to recent fluctuations in foreign currencies. Some people think that we may abandon the policy of monetary stability and protecting the franc. I specifically declare that we have never considered such actions and believe that monetary stability is a prerequisite for the world's economic recovery." (National Telegram, 5th)</p>
<p>Washington: Government officials today still seemed to remain calm regarding the fluctuations in foreign exchange, apparently deeply convinced that the government has the power to cope with any financial situation that endangers American business. Observers said that the backing for this confidence is actually the huge amount of cash reserves held by the United States, which is sufficient to subdue any speculator who wants to gamble by taking advantage of the dollar's decline. Moreover, the United States has apparently decided to continue to maintain the cash ratio of $35 per ounce. Treasury Secretary Morgenthau has also stated that the international gold bullion standard is still effective, so this statement has become even more powerful. Experts explained that the Treasury Secretary's statement means that the United States will maintain the world gold price of $35 per ounce, regardless of how other countries' currencies fluctuate. The current method of maintaining the international gold bullion standard by the Department of the Treasury is to sell gold reserves when the gold price rises to $35.22 per ounce and continue to absorb it when it falls to $34.78. The reason for the standard of 22 cents difference at the time of purchase and sale is that this number is equal to the insurance and freight costs for cash flowing between Europe and the United States per ounce. Therefore, if the gold price rises again, or is about to ship gold to Europe, it is reported that the Treasury Department is willing to allow cash to be shipped out, as it did in September last year. Senior government officials said today that the recent changes in foreign exchange have no impact on American commerce and do not hinder the government's huge fiscal plan. They believe that the public has welcomed the Treasury Department's recent issuance of new bonds. By April 15, of the 25 billion yuan in bonds issued during the European War, only 3,270,569,550 yuan will not have been recovered, and the rest will be completely converted into new bonds with lower interest rates.

<p>Overview of the Tumultuous Events in Xinjiang in Recent Years (5)</p>
<p>Fuyuan is the old site of the Tang Dynasty's Beiting Protectorate. It is located on the north side of the Tianshan Mountains, 90 li east of Gucheng, 370 li west of Dihua, south across the Tianshan Mountains, connected with Turpan and Kun, and borders Halamay to the north, facing the Altai Mountains from afar. Gucheng is an important town on the east road, and Fuyuan is located between Dihua and Gucheng, with crisscrossing canals and fertile land, known as a rich producing area. Its importance is particularly great. Therefore, the former Qing Dynasty's Jimusa Deputy Commander and the Grain Affairs Office were both located here. At the end of the Guangxu period, it was changed to a county seat. In the autumn of the 17th year of the Republic of China, all place names that followed the official system of the former Qing Dynasty were reformed one after another, so the Fuyuan Deputy Commander was dismissed, and one battalion of troops was stationed there. In the 22nd year of the Republic of China, Ma Zhongying led his troops to re-enter Xinjiang, intending to surround Dihua, gathered his main force, and besieged Fuyuan. After nine days and eight nights, the soldiers and civilians in the city, with few soldiers and inferior weapons, were able to unite and fight, so that this small city was not breached by the strong enemy's cloud ladders, cannons, landmines, and underground tunnels. Ma Zhongying, who once dominated the battlefield, unexpectedly suffered a setback. The process of the events is worth recounting, because it shows that cooperation between officials and civilians can achieve the effect of the weak defeating the strong.</p>
<p>Initially, when Ma broke through Dabancheng, he sent commanders Chen Qingyu, Ma Yuliang, the commander-in-chief of the northern route, and Ma Zhanlu, the regimental commander, to attack Fuyuan one after another, but they all retreated in failure. Ma was displeased when he heard this, thinking that Fuyuan was isolated at the foot of the Tianshan Mountains, and the city was as small as a dipper. How could it not be conquered? So he personally led two thousand and several hundred cavalrymen, and on the night of November 12th, he opened to Quanzijie in the southern district of Fuyuan. At the fifth watch (early morning), he gathered the troops and instructed them on the strategy of attacking the city, and said that they would all eat breakfast in the city of Jimusa (Fuyuan). Early that morning, it was slightly snowy, and the ground was white. Ma ordered the soldiers to turn their white fur coats to reflect the color of the snow, so as to confuse the defending soldiers and civilians. It was already dawn, and the defenders were very tired and did not know that the enemy was approaching the city. The enemy put ladders to the city from the north side and climbed up. A young man from a household who was guarding the city was holding a spear and leaning against the crenellations, half-asleep. Fortunately, he was awakened, and fiercely stabbed the enemy who was climbing the parapet, causing him to fall under the city. The remaining enemies saw that there was defense in the city, so they fired in unison, and machine guns swept the wall. Mortars and hand grenades were also thrown into the city one after another, and the sound was like the collapse of ten thousand mountains, which was terrifying to hear. The defending soldiers and civilians fought hard by throwing stones, and also used various firearms such as the Pishan Long Dragon to fight back in a continuous cycle. The enemy tried desperately to pounce, but ultimately failed. However, many of the city's battlements were destroyed. The defending soldiers and civilians had no shelter, so they hurriedly dug trenches on the city wall, lay down, and fought back. The battle stopped slightly at noon. Ma coerced the villagers to send a letter to the city, stating, "Attacking Fuyuan is an important strategic policy in military affairs. We are determined to win. If you do not surrender early, we will kill our way into the city, and no one will be left alive," etc. At this time, the city people realized that the attacker was Ma Zhongying, who had been causing trouble for many years and had slaughtered hundreds of thousands of people in Gansu and Xinjiang provinces. There were only a few hundred defending soldiers in the city, two hundred rifles, and very little ammunition. The four sides and four corners of the city were assigned for defense. Each place had no more than twenty rifles, and the remaining soldiers and civilians held fire guns, knives, spears, and sticks, and each guarded a crenellation, not allowing them to move around. Although there were hundreds of casualties, none were afraid of retreating. The breaches in the city's crenellations were blocked with woolen bundles or sandbags filled with earth at any time. At night, fearing that the enemy's ladders would be difficult to detect, new bricks soaked in kerosene were burned and suspended outside the city's crenellations, and they remained lit like paintings. However, the bricks were easily broken by bullets, so thick hemp cloth was used instead, and the effect was even better. The enemy repeatedly launched large-scale attacks on the city with cloud ladders at night, so the city used long dragons filled with gunpowder and broken pot shards as bullets to shoot from a relaxed position, hitting the enemy. One night, after the battle stopped, the defending soldiers and civilians saw many discarded guns and bullets in the city's moat, so they sent soldiers to descend the city to retrieve more than seventy pistols and more than 30,000 bullets from the enemy corpses, and distributed them to the defenders, and their morale was greatly boosted. One day, before dawn, a huge object was vaguely seen outside the northeast city, hanging high in the sky. Upon closer inspection, it was a woolen pile erected by the enemy. The Fuyuan City God Temple is located outside the northeast corner of the city, and its opera stage is several zhang higher than the city wall. From the top of the opera stage, one can overlook the city. The enemy took advantage of the night to erect a woolen pile on top of the opera stage and hid on top of it to shoot into the city. Being at a high position, they were unmatched. The soldiers and civilians on the city immediately dug trenches to hide themselves and dug a window on the top of the Zhenwu Building on the north city wall. The window was surrounded by earthen mounds to make it as high as the woolen pile on the City God Temple's opera stage, and specially selected gunmen took turns shooting at the high mound. Ma saw that the high mound had lost its reliance and came up with the plan of digging a tunnel to attack. The city detected the situation, fearing that the tunnel would be dug and the enemy would sneak in, so they ordered that where the city wall was close to the enemy's digging, they should first dig a dark ditch along the base of the city wall to meet it. The ditch was large in the middle and small at the opening. A magnetic urn was placed inside with a copper gong covered on top, so that people could listen to it at all times. If there was any digging outside, it could be heard even ten li away. One day, the urn gong suddenly made a loud sound, and they knew that the enemy's tunnel was near. So they summoned strong men to dig day and night. After they connected, they poured water into it, so that the enemy in the tunnel could not stand, and even if they buried landmines, the gunpowder would be wet and difficult to explode. It was estimated that the enemy's tunnel had six or seven vertical and horizontal paths, and three or four of them were connected and filled with water. On the 17th, before dawn, another hole under the east barbican was intercepted by the defending soldiers, and it was not far away. Suddenly, the sound of placing medicine boxes was heard very clearly in the enemy's tunnel. Zhao, the battalion commander of the defending army, and You, the regimental commander, entered the tunnel to inspect one after another, and transported forty buckets of water to the entrance of the tunnel. At this time, if the water was poured in, the gunpowder would definitely be flooded with water. You said, "Why don't we quickly get out of the tunnel and pour water?" Zhao said, "It's too early." Just as they were discussing, there was a loud explosion, and smoke and dust covered their eyes, as if the heavens and earth had collapsed. The enemy's landmine had exploded. The city's gate panels fell into the doorway, and You, Zhao, and several soldiers and civilians were buried in the tunnel. You tried to push the covering earth out and hurriedly rolled into the city under the enemy's bullets. Zhao also escaped with him, while the rest were crushed to death in the tunnel.</p>
<p>When the landmine exploded, the east gate was blasted open, and Ma's troops were fierce, wanting to rush into the city. The city transported sandbags and fought as they piled them up, but the enemy still could not succeed. At this time, there was one of the strangest and most dangerous incidents, that is, when the enemy was fiercely attacking the east gate, a civilian who was digging a tunnel under the inner wall of the east city was going to the northeast corner of the city to relieve himself. Just as he stopped, he vaguely saw a hole under the city wall, as big as the mouth of a bowl, and faintly heard a sound inside. He exclaimed, "There are thieves here!" Suddenly, a gun was fired from the hole. Without any weapons in his hand, the other soldiers heard the call and jumped off the city and fired several shots at the hole. The enemy fled away like rats. Later, they took iron tools to dig it out, and the hole was large enough to hold five people. Then they lit chili peppers, tobacco leaves, and other things at the entrance of the hole and used bellows to fan it. The hidden enemy came out of the city and shouted, "Opium addicts (the Hui people often used this to scold the Han people), please don't bother, we don't eat smoke anyway." Someone thought that if the square wood arranged on the city gate was splashed with petroleum and burned, the city tower would not be safe, and the defense would be in danger. So he came up with a plan to drill two holes in the wood and fill them with earth, so that there would be no fear of being burned. However, all the strong men in the city were guarding on the city wall. The city gate cave was large and required a lot of earth. They were just suffering from a lack of people to transport the earth when suddenly they saw a group of children playing, with one or two of them being the leader, and everyone listened to them. So they summoned the children with the children, and in no time, the children gathered, responding to the call to transport the earth, as many as three or four hundred people. The county magistrate warned them, "Don't walk too fast, or you'll get tired. Don't carry too much, or you'll fall." The children heard this and competed with each other, walking faster and carrying even more. From 9 AM to 5 PM, the tunnel was full of earth. In the afternoon, the sky was foggy, and the yin wind was rustling. Everyone was talking about tigers and changing their colors, and everywhere they felt the sound of digging tunnels, probably because people were too afraid and worried that the enemy would attack us with tunnels again, so they turned illusion into reality. In this way, they held on until noon on the 21st, when reinforcements from Dihua arrived, and the siege of the city was lifted. Ma was defeated and led more than a thousand remnants to flee towards Dabancheng, with more than a thousand casualties. More than 300,000 bullets were also used up. The city was well-defended, and the people were united, so nothing happened in the end. However, the number of deaths and injuries also reached several hundred people. (During a certain night when the War of Resistance was in full swing, when the enemy's tunnel was cut off, more than three hundred dan of water were poured into it within two hours. At this time, the men were all on the city wall, guarding the crenellations and fighting, and those who transported the water were all women, coming and going in a continuous stream, running very fast, and saying as they transported, "Quickly pour water into the tunnel, don't let the enemy in, if they come in, no one will be left alive." Therefore, it worked so quickly. Afterwards, according to the county magistrate's report, the provincial government sent a telegram praising, "Women cooperate in the defense, children struggle, the county magistrate's dispatch is effective, and he is determined to die with the people. It is especially commendable," etc. The so-called county magistrate is the current administrative head of Hami, Liu Yinglin. The battle of Fuyuan was a small one in the Sheng-Ma War, but it was still filled with night attacks, artillery fire, and heavy casualties, and was so intense. If the battles of Nanshan, Ziniquan, the siege of the provincial capital, and the pursuit in southern Xinjiang were to be described in detail, the intensity of the fighting would be ten or a hundred times greater than this. If each were to be described in detail, I don't know how much more terrifying it would be. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>War Zone Security Force: Agreement Reached on Troop Rotation; Sun and Peng's Units from Yutian to Move to Kaiping and Tong Counties; New Security Force of 5,000 to Enter War Zone</h3>
<p>(Beiping Communication) The "war zone" issue, after repeated discussions between representatives of both sides in Tianjin, has reportedly resulted in an agreement to transfer the Yutian Security Force of Feng Shoupeng, Sun Yuchen, and others to parts of Kaiping and Tong Counties. This will be implemented immediately and marks the first step in resolving the "war zone" issue. The date for the new security force to enter the "war zone" is listed as the second step. The Japanese side insists that the takeover of Malanyu Eastern Tombs be the third step, arguing that the late Qing Consorts Yu and Jin are about to be buried in the Eastern Tombs, and it is appropriate to wait until their burial is complete before taking over. Our side has accepted all three steps.</p>
<p>After it was decided that the Yutian Security Force of Feng and Chen would be transferred to Kaiping and Tong Counties, the Hebei Provincial Government issued a relocation order on the 3rd, scheduled to begin on the 5th. However, due to insufficient preparation by the two units, the departure was temporarily changed to the 6th. The new garrison housing had been surveyed and determined in advance by the Luanyu Jimmi district offices. Tao Shangming is currently in Tangshan overseeing the relocation. Gu Rugeng is also scheduled to go to Yutian County on the 6th to supervise the relocation. The relocation of these two units will take about a week to complete.</p>
<p>The number of new security forces entering the "war zone" is limited to 5,000 by the Japanese side. They are currently training in Machang, Yangcun, and other places. The date of departure will be decided by both parties after Hebei Provincial Government Chairman Yu Xuezhong returns north for further consultation. The procedure and route for entering the "war zone" will also be discussed at that time. Previously, there were widespread rumors about the command of the new security force, with some suggesting that the administrative inspector commissioner would concurrently serve as the security commander, following the bandit suppression area model. However, according to authoritative sources, this matter concerns the Hebei provincial administrative system, and it is difficult to say whether it is necessary before careful consideration. The issue of taking over Malanyu Eastern Tombs has been repeatedly postponed and has not been realized. The reason for this is not only that our representatives avoid discussing this matter, but also that the Japanese representatives are unwilling to express any opinions. Recently, after Yin Tong, Yin Rugeng, and others continued discussions with Takahashi, the Japanese side requested that the handover date be set after the Qing Consorts Yu and Jin are buried in the Eastern Tombs. Takahashi, seeing that the "war zone" issue had a beginning, went to Changchun on the evening of the 5th to report to the headquarters of the Japanese Kwantung Army. After his return to Beiping, the issue of the date of taking over Malanyu Eastern Tombs can be expected to be discussed. The coffins of the Qing Consorts Yu and Jin will be transported from Berlin Temple in Beiping within the week and buried in mid-March. By analogy, the handover date will be between the end of March and the beginning of April.</p>
<p>Further news: The security force currently stationed in Yutian is a reorganized old unit of Shi Yousan, consisting of the first and second battalions and a special service guard, totaling more than 2,000 people, led by Sun Jizhou and Feng Shoupeng. Because this unit is controlled by Shi Yousan, its organization and discipline have always been questionable. Therefore, since being stationed in Yutian, it has frequently clashed with local militias, causing great damage to the area. After the second conflict between the security force and militia, the residents of the affected area fled, and the situation has not yet returned to normal. Yutian City is also extremely desolate, with many shops closed and nineteen out of ten people having moved away. The authorities have repeatedly sent personnel to mediate and try to reorganize, but they have been hampered by various factors and unable to start. Now that it has been decided to transfer the security force for training, it is reported that the Yutian Security Supplementary Regiment, Sun Jizhou's unit, will be transferred to the border area of Sanhe and Tong Counties, and the special service unit, Feng Shoupeng's unit, will be transferred to Tangshan Kaiping. Another security battalion stationed in Qinhuangdao, Zhou Yuying's unit, will be transferred to Yutian to fill the gap. Sun Jizhou's unit has about 1,000 people, and Feng Shoupeng's unit has about 400 people. After receiving the order, they immediately began the transfer. Zhou Yuying's unit will also depart from Qinhuangdao, passing through Dadaizhuang in Luan County and Yangjiazhuang in Fengrun County, heading towards Yutian. Zhao Lei's unit, stationed in Tangshan, will be transferred to Kaiping in the coming days to facilitate Feng Shoupeng's unit to move in for training. Li Yunsheng, the commander of the new security regiment, went to Yutian from Beiping on the 5th to direct the transfer of the local security force. (5th)</p>
<h3>Four Provinces Farmers Bank Renamed China Farmers Bank – Expanding Agricultural Loans and Collateral –</h3>
<p>(Wuhu Communication) The Four Provinces Farmers Bank of Henan, Hubei, Anhui, and Jiangxi has established a branch in Wuhu, which has been in operation for half a year. Its general business is the same as other banks, but it is particularly dedicated to agricultural loans and collateral. Therefore, the bank's banknotes and subsidiary coins are widely circulated within the four provinces. Recently, I met with Mao Maoqing, the president of the Wuhu branch, who said that since its establishment, the head office's business has been growing, and branches have been added in Shaanxi (Xi'an, Nanzheng, Ankang, Tianshui), Fujian (Putian, Chengnei, Xiamen), Zhejiang (Hangzhou), Jiangsu (Nanjing, Shanghai), and Anhui (Wuhu). It has been working hard to provide agricultural product collateral loans, cooperative loans, and manage agricultural warehouses. However, because the bank's name is limited to the four provinces, it has been hampered in developing its business and circulating its banknotes. Now, the 20th board meeting of the head office has resolved to apply for a name change to the China Farmers Bank, which will be implemented on April 1st. Items that cannot be changed, such as banknotes that have already been issued, will still be used as usual, and checks will be stamped. Other items such as store signs and forms will all be replaced with the new name at that time, and agricultural and agricultural product loans and various collaterals will be further expanded. (March 5th)</p>
<h3>Shao Yuanchong Visits Jin Hua Scenic Spots</h3>
<p>(Hangzhou News) Beishan in Jinhua County is world-renowned for its rock caves. Recently, the Beishan Renovation Committee excavated and opened the collapsed Shuanglong Inner Cave and built the Ancient Jinhua Temple and the Buddha Longevity Pavilion, making it even more beautiful. There is a highway to Luodian, and transportation, food, and accommodation are very convenient. Therefore, many people from Shanghai and Hangzhou have been visiting recently. Shao Yuanchong, a member of the Central Committee of the Kuomintang, recently came to Hangzhou on official business and took the time to travel by the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway to visit. It is said that Shao appreciated the Shuanglong Yonghu and Chaozhen caves.</p>
<h3>Songjiang: Defense Corps Leader Arrested for Colluding with Bandits</h3>
<p>Guo Jiaquan, who was captured in the case of Yang Meimei, a notorious bandit who roamed the three counties of Songjiang, Jinshan, and Qingpu, confessed that Cao Yunfu, the leader of the Xiaozheng Defense Corps, had colluded with bandits in the past. Although Yang Meimei was executed, Guo Jiaquan was transferred to the court and confessed as before. The county court then requested the Qingpu County government to send police to arrest him, but the Qingpu County police did not capture Cao. The police from Songjiang joined forces with the local water patrol team and dispatched a team to Jiaodiaowan, where Cao was arrested and brought to court. He was still identified as an accomplice by Guo Jiaquan, and was ordered to be detained pending verification.</p>
<h3>Xingye Bank to Hold Regular Auction</h3>
<p>The Songjiang branch of the China Xingye Bank was affected by the collapse of the head office in Shanghai and suspended business at the same time. The creditor, the Farmers Bank, filed a petition with the county court to enforce the seizure. It is now learned that the county court has issued a notice of auction, with a minimum price of 14,000 yuan. Bids will be opened on the 21st.</p>
<h3>Wuxi: Traveler Dies by Poisoning</h3>
<p>On the afternoon of the 3rd of this month, a traveler came to the Railway Hotel on Chezhan Road. He was about thirty years old, wearing a silk robe and glasses. He claimed to be named Tang Yaogeng from Wuxing, Zhejiang. He immediately booked room number 18 and stayed there, going out for leisure during the day and returning to the hotel to sleep at night. However, on the morning of the 5th, Tang suddenly took several sleeping pills to commit suicide. After taking the pills, he remained calm and hired a rickshaw to visit Xiaojishan. After arriving there at about 1 pm, he crossed the lake to visit Yuantouzhu. He sat briefly in Guangfu Temple and then wandered around Wang's Taihu Villa several times. Suddenly, he became unconscious and fell down by the trees on the Sanshan Road. The workers guarding the villa saw him and immediately telegraphed the Ninth Branch Guard Post, which sent police up the mountain to carry Tang down and cross the shore, sending him to Tongren Hospital and the county clinic for injections and emergency treatment. However, due to severe poisoning, he was unable to be revived. His body was carried to the front of the clinic, where Song Baoji, the head of the Northeast Sixth Map, reported to the court for an autopsy. Yesterday (the 6th), Prosecutor Ren led officials to conduct an autopsy, which confirmed that he had died from poisoning. He ordered the head of the Northeast Sixth Map to collect the body and wait for relatives to claim it.</p>
<h3>Private Opium Den Cracked Down</h3>
<p>The Supervision Division of the local Public Security Bureau received a secret report a few days ago stating that Cheng Ziquan, the owner of the former Qiayue Clothing Store, and his son Cheng Donglin, had established a den to sell private opium and requested a search and arrest. After receiving the report, Director Wang sent Inspector Ge to find a lead. Inspector Ge purchased two ounces of private opium from Cheng with six yuan of marked money. Then Inspector Ge led more than 20 police officers from the guard and patrol teams to Cheng's residence in Heze Lane for a search. Cheng Ziquan was arrested on the spot, but Cheng Donglin escaped. Cheng Ziquan confessed that the opium was supplied by Zhang Xusen, also known as Zhang Shunxing, nicknamed Pig Bajie, who lived at door number 53 of the Fourth Branch Road of Guangqin and was formerly a locomotive mechanic on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway. Cheng Ziquan was willing to lead the police to arrest him. Inspector Ge and others then went to the address to arrest Zhang Xusen and his accomplice Zhou Fuqing, and seized five packages of private opium. They were all taken to the bureau for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Supervisory Council Opposes Additional Property Tax</h3>
<p>Han Zishi, chairman of the Jiangsu Provincial Tax Supervisory Committee, believes that the provincial government has decided to collect property tax from all counties starting this month without going through legal procedures, which is obviously inconsistent with central regulations. If implemented, it will inevitably increase the burden on both urban and rural residents, and farmers will be especially unable to bear it. He has decided to convene a meeting of all committee members on the 10th of this month to discuss it. A notice was issued yesterday, and merchants and residents of various counties believe that the provincial government's actions violate the central government's Provisional Law on Supervision of Local Finances and the resolutions of the Second National Financial Conference last year. The provincial tax supervisory committees have a real need to report it, so they have high expectations for the committee.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou: Water Conservancy Expert Gu Delai</h3>

They inspected the Hexi project and left Shangba at 3:30 PM to inspect Qingjiang, Suqian, and other places.</p>

<p>Local News</p>
<h3>Kong Xiangxi Arrives in Shanghai This Morning to Handle Dispute over Shenxin No. 7 Factory</h3>
<p>The Central News Agency reports that after the Shenxin Textile Company's No. 7 Factory was illegally auctioned off by the British-owned HSBC Bank, the possibility of reversing the situation has emerged due to government intervention and enthusiastic support from all sectors. Although a concrete solution has not yet been decided, it will likely involve the Ministry of Finance guaranteeing payment in installments. Rong Zongjing, the general manager of the company, has not only sought to secure loans from banks and native banks but has also entrusted Mr. Borgel, the manager of Xiangmao Foreign Firm, to negotiate with Mr. Houchimon, the manager of HSBC, to request that the interest of 160,000 yuan be paid first and that the remaining loans be repaid over a one-year extension. HSBC has also agreed to consider this. However, a certain evening newspaper reported yesterday that Rong had suddenly denied this. A reporter from the China Interior News Agency went to Rong's residence to inquire and Rong stated that the news reported in the newspaper was inaccurate but said that the future of the negotiations was still uncertain and that he still hoped for government assistance. Furthermore, according to the second creditor, it is feared that these negotiations will be very difficult to be optimistic about. Moreover, Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi had originally planned to come to Shanghai from Hankou via Beijing as soon as possible to handle official business and resolve the dispute over the Shenxin No. 7 Factory, but he was slightly delayed in Beijing due to important official business. It was not until last night that he took the night express train from Beijing and arrived in Shanghai this morning.</p>
<h3>Japanese Envoy Enters Beijing Last Night; Definite Date of Return Undecided</h3>
<p>The Central News Agency reports that the Japanese Ambassador to China, Ariyoshi Akira, along with Counselor Arino and Secretary Yokokawa, a party of three, took the night express train from Shanghai to Beijing at 11:00 PM last night. According to Counselor Arino, who spoke to a reporter from the Central News Agency, the Ambassador's visit to Beijing is for no special business. After arriving in Beijing, he will meet with President Wang to have some talks. This is a routine courtesy visit once a month. He will stay in Beijing for two days and take the night express train from Beijing to Shanghai at 11:00 PM on the evening of the 8th. As for the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs' telegram summoning the Ambassador back to Japan, I have not heard of it, so the definite date of the Ambassador's return has not yet been decided.</p>
<h3>Italian Ambassador Has Returned to Shanghai; Mayor Wu to Host Banquet Tonight</h3>
<p>The Italian Ambassador to China, Lojacono, accompanied by his wife, arrived in Shanghai on the night express train from Beijing at 11:30 PM on the 5th. The Mayor of Shanghai, Wu Tiecheng, will host a banquet in his private residence on Haig Road at 7:00 PM on the evening of the 7th to welcome the Ambassador. Wu had originally planned to host a banquet for the Italian Ambassador on the 26th of last month, but the date was postponed because the Ambassador was eager to enter Beijing. It is understood that after the banquet hosted by Mayor Wu, the Italian Ambassador will stay in Shanghai for a short time before going to Beiping to inspect embassy affairs and the situation of the Italian community.</p>
<h3>International Loan to China: Financial Circles Observe: No Definite News Received, Impossible to Say</h3>
<p>Hope That the U.S. Silver Policy Will Not Proceed Rapidly</p>
<p>The Daily News reports that the talk of an international loan to China has become rampant in recent days. Western newspapers report as if it were certain. However, this matter is closely related to the current financial situation. A reporter from the Daily News visited important figures in the financial community to inquire. It is learned that this statement originated from the United States. Whether it is reliable is worth studying. However, looking at the Washington telegrams, it is unknown whether the talks between the Chinese Ambassador to the United States, Shi Zhaoji, and the U.S. government authorities were ordered to negotiate. Because the matter concerns national politics, the financial community has not received definite news about this matter, so it is impossible to say. However, based on reasoning, there are many doubts. Assuming that the United States can lend to China, is it possible for the United States to have the lending capacity at a time when its silver policy has not been completed? The economic problems of China and the United States are both moving towards the same path of needing silver. China is suffering adverse effects from the United States' active purchase of silver and is maintaining that silver does not flow out and needs a large amount of imports. However, the United States also continues to need to purchase silver to complete its silver policy. It may not lend silver to China. Therefore, from the standpoint of China's financial and business circles, what is hoped from the United States is that it can quickly change the silver purchase procedure in the implementation of the silver policy and not proceed rapidly to avoid causing significant disadvantages to China's financial goods market.</p>

<h3>Two Organizations Are Carrying Out Revitalization Measures in Order: Chamber of Commerce Encourages All Industries to Respond Calmly; Municipal Government Ordered to Hold Meeting</h3>
<p>The Xin Sheng News Agency reports that the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and the Local Coordination Association have each been handling the five measures decided upon after consultation to revitalize the market. In addition, work on stimulating the market is also being carried out. The Municipal Government has also received an order from the Executive Yuan to cooperate with the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry to hold a meeting. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Handling Five Measures Separately: The two organizations have already handled the five measures agreed upon. (1) For discount of bills of exchange in various industries, the two organizations have written to the Central Bank, requesting that it quickly realize its rediscount business in accordance with the Central Bank regulations and expand the amount. They have also sent letters to the banking and native banking guilds. (2) The two organizations have written to the Central Bank to explore the inclusion of title deeds and land license certificates in the Central Bank's voucher guarantee reserve. (3) The two organizations have jointly submitted a report to the Ministry of Finance and sent letters to the Savings Guarantee Reserve Committee to include title deeds and land license certificates in the savings guarantee reserve. (4) Banking and native banking industries should send account books to stores as usual. The two organizations have sent letters to the banking and native banking guilds to circulate them to all banks and native banks. (5) The Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications should accept as much collateral as possible of goods or real estate. The two organizations have sent letters to the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications to handle it.</p>
<p>All Industries Respond Calmly: The Municipal Chamber of Commerce previously received a joint request from twenty trade associations to quickly devise fundamental relief measures. In addition to having telegraphed the government and received a reply from President Wang, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce also replied to the twenty trade associations yesterday, informing them of the five measures decided upon to revitalize the market and the appointment of representatives to prepare to present the case in person. President Wang's telegram also urged all industries to respond calmly.</p>
<p>Promoting Acceptance Drafts: The commercial acceptance drafts created by the silk and satin industry association were approved by the ninth executive committee meeting of the Chamber of Commerce, believing that they were in line with the first of the five measures to revitalize the market and should be promoted. Yesterday, a circular was sent to all industries to uniformly follow suit, and the banking and native banking guilds were given a discount. A public letter was sent to the Central Bank to handle rediscounts in order to increase currency and stimulate the market.</p>
<p>Municipal Government Ordered to Consult: The Central News Agency reports that since various organizations appealed to the authorities for relief for the city's industrial and commercial sectors, the Municipal Government has received an order from the Executive Yuan regarding the matter of relieving the market, to consult with the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry on concrete measures, and then submit a report for approval and implementation. After receiving the order, the Municipal Government will formulate opinions in advance based on the order and hold a meeting with the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry in Shanghai to discuss effective measures to revitalize the market.</p>
<h3>Jiangxi Province Successfully Obtains Water and Electricity Loan; Construction Bank Company to Undertake 1.5 Million Yuan; Song Ziliang Scheduled to Fly to Jiangxi on the 12th to Sign Contract</h3>
<p>The Jiangxi provincial government's planned construction of electric light and water plants, with a total budget of 3 million yuan, has secured a loan of 1.5 million yuan from the China Construction Bank Company. A reporter from the Daily News met with Song Ziliang, the general manager of the Construction Bank Company, yesterday and inquired about everything. Song was kind enough to tell the details. Song is scheduled to fly to Jiangxi by plane on the 12th of this month to sign the loan contract. The details of the conversation are as follows:</p>
<p>Loan Negotiation Process: Song first said that the chairman of Jiangxi Province, Xiong Shihui, in order to develop the province's industry and commerce and revitalize the market, plans to build large-scale electric light and water plants in the provincial capital of Nanchang. However, the projects are magnificent and the province's funds are limited, so he contacted the company last year to negotiate loans and investments. President Xiong secretly discussed it again in Shanghai a month ago, and I personally went to Jiangxi for a survey, which was very satisfactory. Now the general situation has been determined, and this construction is expected to be successful. I believe that Jiangxi Province, which has suffered from banditry for a long time, should also be restored to prosperity as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Total Amount 1.5 Million: As for the foundations of the Jiangxi Province's water and electricity plants, they have long been surveyed and determined in the provincial capital of Nanchang, with more than 200 acres of land. The transportation there is convenient and appropriate. The total cost of the plant buildings, machinery, etc., is about 3 million yuan. The company has now decided to undertake 1.5 million yuan, and the rest will be planned by the province itself. Jiangxi Province has also prepared for this amount and there is no problem.</p>
<p>Scheduled to Sign Contract: After the principles of loan investment were determined, the procedures for signing the contract were also negotiated between the two parties in correspondence. The content will be announced after the formal signing. I am scheduled to fly to Jiangxi by plane with an engineer on the 12th of this month to handle the contract signing procedures and to conduct another survey of everything, so that construction can begin.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau's Work and Facility Plan for the 24th Year: Exerting Utmost Efforts to Assist and Guide Returning Overseas Chinese</h3>
<p>Director Jian of the Shanghai Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau yesterday announced the bureau's work and facility plan for the 24th year. The establishment of this bureau coincides with the global spread of economic recession. Among all the cities, commerce is declining, and domestic rural areas are simultaneously going bankrupt. The country's finances are becoming increasingly strained, and overseas Chinese are facing increasing unemployment. Therefore, the organizations that serve overseas Chinese cannot afford to relax their efforts. Inquiring into overseas Chinese affairs, much of it is not fixed, but the key is still in field work. Now that this bureau is located in the most prosperous area of the country, and a necessary entry and exit point for the national capital, it should have a larger plan to serve overseas Chinese. However, due to economic and budgetary constraints, it is necessary to proceed gradually. At the beginning of the bureau's establishment, letters were sent to party headquarters, consulates, chambers of commerce, and social organizations in the Americas, the South Seas Islands, and Australia, etc., to make them understand the government's intention in establishing overseas Chinese affairs bureaus in various ports, and the responsibilities of the overseas Chinese affairs bureaus, in order to fulfill the duty of guidance and to cooperate fully. During the bureau's preparation, it coincided with the most severe period of unjustified expulsion of overseas Chinese by Japan. The Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission repeatedly requested the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to protest on record and decided on temporary relief measures, providing each person with five silver dollars. At that time, there were as many as fifteen batches, with hundreds of people. To this day, there have been thirty-six batches. Most of the expelled returning overseas Chinese are destitute and impoverished. In this environment of rising prices and a high cost of living, receiving this paltry sum is like a drop in the bucket. They are lost and without shelter. Due to limited funds, this bureau could only, in an unavoidable situation, distinguish their origins and request their fellow villagers in Shanghai to find ways to subsidize travel expenses, so that they could plan to return home. Fortunately, the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, at this time, purchased more than 10,000 acres of land in Xuancheng, Anhui, to establish the Overseas Chinese Happy Village, specifically to resettle unemployed returning overseas Chinese, and established the Unemployed Returning Overseas Chinese Relief Committee, which is specifically responsible for all reclamation and relief matters in the Overseas Chinese Happy Village. All those within the Shanghai area are ordered to be handled by this bureau. The most difficult thing is that the unemployed returning overseas Chinese are in this severe cold season, and their immediate hunger and cold have yet to be resolved. Preparing travel expenses is naturally impossible. As a last resort, this bureau asked the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to provide free passage for the overseas Chinese as a benevolent gesture. As a result, due to company regulations, only half-fare was approved. The only business of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau is the registration of overseas Chinese going abroad and entering the country. Due to custom and subordination, it is still being carried out. The current work plan of this bureau can only adopt what is practical and suitable for the local environment, and implement it as soon as possible: (1) Regarding the relief of overseas Chinese, in recent years, various countries, due to the difficulty in resolving the unemployment problem, have resorted to expelling overseas Chinese on various pretexts. Inquiring into the returning overseas Chinese who are in distress, most of them are laborers. Those who have been expelled from Japan will be given a living allowance of five yuan per person, in accordance with the resolution, until March 1st. In the future, those who have no home to return to will be introduced by this bureau to the Overseas Chinese Happy Village in Anhui for reclamation (limited to those who pass the examination). (2) Regarding guidance and answering inquiries, overseas Chinese have been away from their hometowns for a long time and are often unfamiliar with the situation in the motherland. This bureau is an organization that serves overseas Chinese. If there are those who do not understand the domestic situation and want to inquire, this bureau will clearly explain and guide everything. The following is an outline of the scope of guidance and answers: (A) Regarding preventing deception by bad people and guiding customs declaration and tax payment when returning overseas Chinese first arrive in Shanghai; (B) Regarding guiding or introducing returning overseas Chinese to invest in industries and conduct inspections and tours; (C) Regarding guiding overseas Chinese to study in China and recommending the children of overseas Chinese to study in domestic schools; (D) Regarding guiding returning overseas Chinese to report to local foreign consuls and process passport transfers or stamps; (E) Regarding answering inquiries from overseas Chinese doing business abroad, such as inquiring about the economic status of banks or commercial organizations, or other situations, and handling commissions from overseas Chinese, such as collecting catalogs of domestic products, etc. (3) Regarding persuasion and propaganda, in order to resettle unemployed returning overseas Chinese, the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission has built the Overseas Chinese Happy Village in Xuancheng, Anhui, engaged in reclamation, and taught them production knowledge and agricultural and pastoral skills. The intention is excellent, but few unemployed returning overseas Chinese have a good understanding of the Overseas Chinese Happy Village. This bureau plans to find ways to enlighten overseas Chinese and ensure that they understand the purpose of the Overseas Chinese Happy Village, so that unemployed returning overseas Chinese can have a place to live and will not be destitute. At the same time, this bureau also engages in publicizing the purpose and responsibilities of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau, so that overseas Chinese will not be alienated from the government. When distressed overseas Chinese return, they will be greeted with condolences, showing the government's sincere concern for overseas Chinese. (4) Regarding other work, in addition to implementing the above work, if the environment and economy permit, this bureau still hopes to do its best to provide relief to unemployed overseas Chinese. Because Shanghai is a large area, there are particularly many returning overseas Chinese who have been expelled compared to other cities. Since the establishment of this bureau, there have been several cases of people coming to the bureau every day to seek job recommendations, and what they are seeking is only food and lodging. This bureau plans to set up an employment agency for unemployed returning overseas Chinese, introduce them according to their skills, and wait for the factory owners to discuss guarantee measures before submitting a request to open it. As for the guidance and publicity work, we will slightly imitate the tourist guide method and publish it as a booklet, detailing the main traffic routes in Shanghai, annotating the routes of hotels of all levels, and handing it over to sailors for distribution, so that overseas Chinese can find their own place and will not be misled. It also lists the tricks of the pickpockets at the docks, so that the returning overseas Chinese can know how to prevent them.</p>
<h3>Xu Xiuzhi Went to Beijing Yesterday to Meet Wang and Inquire Before Taking Office in the Ministry</h3>
<p>Xu Xiuzhi, the Permanent Vice Minister of the Ministry of Interior, after returning to Shanghai from Moganshan a few days ago, took the special Shanghai-Beijing express train at 4:00 PM yesterday and entered Beijing.

<h3>Japanese Marines to Conduct Exercises This Morning from 2:00 AM to 7:00 AM, Notifying Our Side to Inform Residents</h3>
<p>According to the Huadong News Agency, the Japanese Shanghai Naval Special Landing Forces will conduct a nighttime exercise and field training this morning from 2:00 AM to 7:00 AM in the area of ​​the extended road construction at the end of Jiangwan Road and North Sichuan Road in the Hongkou District. Major General Sugisaka, the commander of the landing forces, Assistant Officer Kobetsuto, and other officers will serve as commanders, and the exercise will end at 7:00 AM this morning. The exercise location is limited to the area of ​​the extended road construction, and the landing forces notified our side's municipal government, public security bureau, and other police agencies in advance. The Municipal Public Security Bureau has issued a notice to all sub-bureaus to inform them. As for the North Station Sub-bureau and the North Sichuan Road Sub-bureau (ie, the first sub-station of the fifth district), which are near the exercise site, police officers have been dispatched to maintain order within the boundary and inform residents not to panic.</p>
<h3>China Aviation Ford New Aircraft to Be Transported to Longhua This Morning for Assembly</h3>
<p>The large Ford aircraft prepared by China Aviation Corporation for the Chongqing-Kunming route was shipped to Shanghai on the first of this month. The aircraft is currently placed at the Osaka Wharf in Hongkou. Yesterday, the company completed customs clearance with the customs, and handed the bill of lading to the Maotai Foreign Firm, who will pick it up at the Osaka Wharf this morning and transport it to the hangar in Longhua Airport for assembly.</p>
<h3>Tianli Light Gas Plant to Ship Goods Next Month, Machinery Parts Are Being Installed</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the Tianli Light Gas Products Plant, which was initiated and organized by the industrial giant Wu Yun Chu, with a total capital of one million yuan, began preparations last spring and purchased machinery worth 300,000 yuan in the United States. The machinery has already been shipped to Shanghai for installation. Yesterday, the Central News Agency reporter learned that the plant will not be able to start production and ship goods until the beginning of next month. The recent situation of the plant is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Preparations Completed: This light gas plant is a pioneering project in China. Its main products are nitric acid and ammonia, which are widely used. At the beginning of the preparations, the factory buildings were built in Zhou Taipu Temple, and Wu purchased a large number of machines in the United States at a low price and transported them to Shanghai for installation, which is about to be completed.</p>
<p>Installing Machinery Parts: Wu said that the light gas plant belongs to heavy industry, which is much more troublesome than light industry, especially the installation of machinery is very complicated. The original plan was to complete the installation by the end of last month, but it was not possible. Although the main project has been completed, other machinery parts are still waiting to be installed. Moreover, this pioneering industry must be taken seriously in advance, so it must be postponed to the beginning of next month before it can be installed, start production, and ship goods.</p>

<h3>Two Notices from the Municipal Government</h3>
<p>Banning Money Shops Discriminating Against Auxiliary Currency: Municipal Government Notice No. 209 states that the Ministry of Finance has sent a letter stating that money shops in Beijing and Shanghai have been discriminating against silver coins from the 7th to 10th years of the Republic of China, refusing to accept them from each other, or lowering their exchange rates. This has been a long-standing problem. The local administrative organs have issued notices to ban it, and in recent years, this trend has subsided slightly. However, those who exchange money still cannot avoid indulging in old habits, discriminating against auxiliary currency, and suppressing exchange rates in order to profit from it and deceive the common people. It is urgent to effectively ban it again to prevent manipulation and stabilize the market. In addition to notifying the Shanghai Money Shop Association and the Nanjing Chamber of Commerce to instruct all money shops to temporarily allow the use of auxiliary coins from the 7th to 10th years of the Republic of China at market prices before the new auxiliary currency is formulated and promulgated, and not to discriminate against them, and sending separate letters, it is appropriate to send a letter for investigation and request a notice to ban it, so that the public is aware of it. This notice is issued by Mayor Wu Tiecheng.</p>
<p>Circulation of Auxiliary Currency of the Four Provinces Agricultural Bank: Municipal Government Notice No. 210 states that the Yugeng Telegraph of the General Commander of the Bandit Suppression Headquarters of the Provinces of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui opened, according to the report of the Farmers Bank of the four provinces of Henan, Hubei, Anhui, and Jiangxi, stating that the one-yuan circulation coupons and one or two-jiao auxiliary currency coupons issued by the Hangzhou Office of the Bank have been submitted to the Department of Finance and Intelligence and issued the No. 4766 directive, and the Zhejiang Provincial Government and the Ministry of Railways have been instructed to collect and use the circulation coupons of the Bank. Now that the Nanjing and Shanghai branches of the Bank have been established one after another, all the above-mentioned circulation issued by the Hangzhou Office is in the area of Beijing and Shanghai. For the convenience of the people, in addition to sending separate letters to the Beijing and Shanghai branches to cash them, it is specially submitted to the Department for prompt action to the Jiangsu Provincial Government, the Nanjing and Shanghai Municipal Governments to issue notices, and to inform their subordinates to issue notices, so that all the places where the circulation coupons of the Bank are located will be collected and used to facilitate circulation. According to this, the requests of the Bank are not inconsistent, and should be approved. In addition to the directives and separate letters, it is urgent to send a telegraph to investigate and handle them. This notice is issued by Mayor Wu Tiecheng.</p>

<h3>Organizational Methods of Various Marketing Cooperatives</h3>
<p>(Continued) Speech by Mr. Stevens</p>
<p>Some people argue that farmers have shallow abilities, so the centralized type is more suitable than the united type, because the centralized type only needs a capable manager to proceed smoothly. Indeed, if there is an excellent leader, the centralized type can be adopted. However, the difficulty lies in the leader's problem. When selecting a leader, there are also special considerations. If it is the leader of a centralized cooperative, then relying only on one judgment and lacking factual basis, if the selected person is unfortunately defeated, then its impact will affect the entire cooperative. If it is the leader of a united cooperative, then its impact is only limited to one branch. When this leader handles the branch, if the performance is not good, then the opportunity to be elected as the leader of the united cooperative is very small. Even if the staff of the united cooperative is mistakenly elected, the matters handled by the united cooperative are only limited to a part of the marketing work, and its harm to the cooperative is very significant. The leaders of the united cooperative must first have good results in the branch before they have the opportunity to be elected to the united cooperative. Therefore, the united cooperative can easily obtain experienced leaders, but the centralized type cannot guarantee this. In short, if there is an excellent leader, then the centralized type can indeed progress faster than the united type. However, the opinion of the centralized manager cannot represent the opinion of the majority.</p>
<p>The methods of marketing cooperatives are quite inconsistent. For those with simple businesses, such as wool marketing cooperatives, etc., it is not necessary to have a two-layer organization like other cooperatives. Furthermore, for egg and chicken marketing cooperatives, farmers use chicken farming as a side business. It is only necessary to drive cars to various places to collect products, without the need for large-scale equipment. Then, there is no need for the above-mentioned complex organization. In Virginia in the United States, there is a vegetable cooperative, near a city, where transportation is very convenient, and there is a railway running through it. Its organization is centralized, and the manager is quite experienced. Therefore, although it is a centralized cooperative, the results are very good. In addition to the head office, there are also several branch offices, with slight equipment, all under the jurisdiction of the general manager. This cooperative has such results because of good management. Otherwise, the result is difficult to predict. Moreover, because transportation is convenient, it is convenient for members to participate in the conference and travel back and forth. These are all major reasons for success. Otherwise, I am afraid that the strength is difficult to win. Therefore, according to past circumstances, it is not possible to make a sudden judgment on which of these methods is superior or inferior. In short, the centralized type can only be adopted when it is absolutely necessary, and the location of its weaknesses should be carefully examined. Within the possible scope, the united type is still more appropriate.</p>
<p>E. Terminal Market Marketing Cooperative. This cooperative can jointly establish cooperative consignment offices in major cities to specialize in operating products transported by various branches. The money obtained, in addition to slightly collecting handling fees, is remitted to the cooperative that transports the goods. Taking livestock as an example, when livestock is transported out, livestock merchants cannot go to the local area to buy and sell. Therefore, the local cooperative must find a way to transport it onto vehicles and mark it for identification. Therefore, this cooperative does not need equipment. It only needs to decide the date of transportation in advance, and then notify the members to load the livestock onto the vehicle on time. Livestock is not as easy to sort as other goods. Therefore, there must be detailed records when loading to avoid confusion.</p>
<p>The operation and marketing of the Terminal Market Cooperative Consignment Office is relatively economical and suitable. The business locations of the consignment offices are located in the trading center of the city, so sales are extremely easy. Moreover, the staff is more familiar with the local marketing situation and will not be fooled. A lack of experienced instructors may easily advocate that the organization of the united cooperative should also be adopted in the terminal market. However, this situation must be considered, because the sales of various markets are sometimes different. Therefore, the production area must determine its sales location according to the market conditions of each market. The distances between each other vary. Fixing it to one terminal market is not entirely suitable in practice. Because it can join several terminal markets at the same time, in principle, the cooperative has the rights and obligations to a certain terminal market, and it seems that it has no vested interest in other terminal markets. It seems unfair to force it to assume equal responsibilities. Forcing a union will definitely have no results.</p>

<h3>Aviation Donation Collection: Team Leaders Striving to Proceed</h3>
<p>After the Shanghai Second Fundraising Campaign of the China Aviation Association began, it was heard that Guo Yunguan, the president of the First Special District Court, who served as the leader of the 32nd team, immediately ordered all personnel of the court to join as members after receiving the letter of appointment, and the members separately raised aviation patriotic funds from outside. He Zhuoxian, the leader of the 218th team, is the director of the Trademark Bureau. He has decided that all the staff of the bureau will be members, and will expand the recruitment of members and persuade people to donate aviation patriotic donations. It can be seen that the team leaders are enthusiastically carrying out the fundraising work in general.</p>
<p>Ma Jiazhen, the principal of Huadong Women's Middle School, after receiving the appointment of the chief captain as the captain of the 355th team, immediately actively carried out the fundraising work. It is heard that it is stipulated that all teachers and staff of the school must join, and what kind of members are admitted according to their economic situation. All middle school students are also members, and those with the ability are selected to do their best to persuade people to donate aviation patriotic donations, and parents of each student are requested to join as members. Because the various solicitation documents issued by the chief captain's office before are insufficient for distribution, please continue to issue 500 badges and membership certificates, 20 receipt books for membership fees, and 10 receipt books for donations for distribution. The office has already sent them as requested.</p>
<p>Gu Jiwu, the captain of the 343rd team, is the principal of Qingnian Middle School. It is heard that he has appointed the directors of each department of the school as deputy captains, and all teachers, staff and some students as team members, and actively persuades relatives and friends and student families from the outside to donate aviation patriotic donations.</p>
<p>Zhu Jingan, the chairman of the Oil Press Association, is the captain of the 170th team. He is doing his best to collect donations. A few days ago, he convened the association meeting, and joined the Aviation Association as a group member in the name of the association. More importantly, manufacturers of each industry are members, and each member will do their best to solicit donations from the workers in their factories and from the outside. It can be seen that the business community enthusiastically supports aviation patriotism.</p>

<h3>Xiong Xiling's Report on the Investigation of the Disaster Situation in Jiangshan</h3>
<p>Xiong Xiling, the president of the China General Association of the World Red Swastika Society, reported that: The Association previously received a letter and telegram from the Jiangshan County Relief Committee requesting relief, and turned it over to Ling for review. Ling replied immediately, waiting for the visit to Jiangshan to visit relatives and investigate the situation before reporting back to Shanghai. On February 21, Ling went to Jiangshan County and stayed for four days, repeatedly inquiring about the disaster situation from the gentry and people in the city and countryside of the county, and also met Mr. Xu of the Xiaohui Society of Beiping, who was distributing relief from Qu County and went to Jiangshan to investigate the disaster. According to him, the disaster situation in Jiangshan is more serious than that in Qu County. The disaster victims in the countryside have exhausted the ferns they dug for food, and are about to run out of food. I am afraid they will not be able to survive until the wheat harvest. The knowledge gained is listed below: 1. Jiangshan County suffered the most severe drought last year, with only 20% of the harvest. Originally, Jiangshan's normal grain production was not enough for the county's population to eat, and it still needed to purchase 20% of grain from other counties. Now that neighboring counties are also barren and grain prices are rising daily, it is not known how to start transporting the required 80% of grain. This is the first major problem in the county. 2. Jiangshan is located on the border, and the news is not very well-informed. There are no large merchants from the county in Shanghai, which is different from the situation in Ningbo Haini. Therefore, although it suffered this major disaster, there is no one to publicize it, and few people in the cities and commercial ports know the actual situation. This time, Zhejiang Province issued a relief fund of 12,000 yuan. After withdrawing 4,000 yuan to run the porridge factory, the remaining 8,000 yuan was distributed to 20,000 households of disaster victims, with each household receiving only 4 jiao, which is of no help. Although the Drought Relief Association of various provinces has sent personnel to investigate and release relief, it is not yet known whether they can share some. Other charitable organizations, only the Xiaohui Society, came here from Qu County, but it is heard that its relief fund is also only a few thousand yuan. Jiangshan urgently needs relief, and it is urgent and cannot be delayed. 3. There are about 30,000 boatmen in Jiangshan who rely on this for a living. Since the railway was opened, many boatmen have lost their jobs. In addition, last year, the communists sneaked in and went straight through the county from north to south. The first, third, and fourth districts were all ravaged. Jiangshan's folk customs are known as strong and fierce. Cases of robbery are endless at ordinary times. There are still more than 500 people detained in the prison. Two disasters have come together, and the people have no food to eat. They must become bandits, which is a major problem for public security. What's more, all counties are suffering from disasters. If there is incitement, a spark will start a prairie fire, which is more than just a matter of public security in Zhejiang Province. 4. The Zhejiang Provincial Construction Department has designated 80,000 yuan for the work of building dams and sluices on the Yu River. The local officials plan to ask for the separate management of dredging rivers and drilling wells. However, if Western-style dams and sluices are adopted, about 70% of the money will be used for purchasing materials, and about 30% will be used for labor relief for disaster victims. If earthen dams are built, rivers are dredged, and wells are drilled using the native method, about 40% of the money will be used for purchasing materials, and about 60% will be used for labor relief for disaster victims. For the sake of saving the lives of disaster victims at present, it is appropriate to use the native method temporarily, which can save more lives. In the future, when the local area develops, it can still be changed to the Western style. Ling conveyed this point to Chairman Huang in person yesterday in Hangzhou, who agreed very much. 5. Because there are so many disaster victims begging for food in Jiangshan, 24 porridge factories have been set up in the county's urban and rural areas as a last resort. Each factory has about 1,000 people eating porridge every day, a total of 24,500 people. In the future, it will gradually increase, and the number will be more than this. However, the local area is very large, and some disaster victims who eat porridge come from as far as 10 or 20 miles away. It was heard a few days ago that an old woman from the countryside went to the city to eat porridge, passed through the railway, and was crushed to death by a train, which is very pitiful. However, in addition to the 4,000 yuan of provincial relief funds and the 8,000 yuan raised by the gentry and merchants in each township, these porridge factories are only enough for the current month's use. According to the monthly requirement of 60 shi of rice per factory, calculating 24 factories for 4 months, a total of 5,760 shi of rice are required. At a price of 11 yuan per shi, a total of 63,360 yuan is required. If the wheat is harvested this year, it can be used to help the people's food. The porridge factories can be abolished after May. Therefore, in order to find a way to relieve the disaster in Jiangshan, it is necessary to raise more than 50,000 yuan of insufficient porridge factory expenses, so that tens of thousands of disaster victims who are waiting to be fed can extend their lives. The above five items are all the actual situation of the Jiangshan disaster. A summary report is hereby made in general. It seems that this association should initiate and persuade charitable people in Shanghai to help as much as possible to save the disaster victims in this area. If there is any inappropriateness, please decide. Moreover, Zhou Xinwan, the county magistrate of Jiangshan County, is kind to the people and eliminates violence, and his political achievements are remarkable. All the gentry and merchants in the county are fair and honest people. Ling personally visited the porridge factories in the city this time and witnessed the gentry and merchants serving the disaster victims, holding porridge beans and giving them to the disaster victims, which is rare. If charitable organizations and individuals raise money to go to distribute relief, they will be able to facilitate everything and achieve practical results. This is stated together.</p>
<h3>Sino-Foreign Charity Relief Association: Reports of a Glimpse of Spring Famine in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui</h3>
<p>Renji Road: The drought relief efforts managed by the association are not yet concluded, and the spring famine already presents a dangerous situation. Because those affected are all small farmers, they lack clothing and food, and crucially, seed for planting. They are sitting idly awaiting death, deeply fearing that efforts will be wasted. Fund-raising is underway. Here are summaries of reports received from various Chinese and Western sources:</p>
<p>(Liyang) Yesterday, Mr. Cheng Jingsheng personally visited the association to report that his inspection of Liyang revealed an exceptionally tragic situation. Disaster victims have no means of survival, and are dying in droves. Some die from eating "Guanyin flour" (a kind of clay) and bloating to death. Others are poisoned by incorrectly adding sugar to elm bark they are consuming. Coarse grains and chaff are viewed as precious commodities. Some even die from bloating from those. It is truly unbearable to describe.</p>
<p>(Tongxiang) Western missionary Mr. Hua Disheng reported that he had recently visited the countryside to inspect the work-relief projects in the county. He found that the river near Dingjiaqiao, which had dried up and become a bottomless ditch last year, has now been dredged deeply and restored to free flow, allowing boats to travel unhindered. Farmers on both banks, seeing the association's work, have also successively deepened small creeks. Regardless of high or low-lying fields, they are able to benefit from irrigation. The funds allocated can be said to have been used without waste, with the results being practical. There are still several places where work-relief projects are essential, to not only alleviate the spring famine, but also prevent future disasters.</p>
<p>(Xuancheng) Western missionary Mr. Bai Shou reported that Xuancheng has been severely hit by the disaster, to an unprecedented extent. Therefore, he is writing specifically to request relief. Two-thirds of the county is upland, yielding no harvest last year due to the severe drought. While the lowland areas did have some autumn harvest, the disaster victims were burdened with heavy debts from the previous flood, making it impossible for them to eke out a living. Farmers account for 70% of the population, and their lives are hanging by a thread. Deaths from starvation have been widely reported. In the disaster areas, many are resorting to eating green shoots and tree bark to stave off hunger. According to elderly people, they have never encountered such a catastrophe. A reliable report states that one family of seven has already seen five members die of starvation. Another person, Mr. Jia, died after falling while climbing a mountain to gather firewood, due to exhaustion. A woman holding a nursing infant was also on the verge of death. On the fifteenth day of the first lunar month, thousands of disaster victims from various villages, supporting the old and carrying the young, flocked to the market town begging for food, rarely finding enough to fill their stomachs. At the door of Reverend Zhao's wife, a member of our church, disaster victims were seen dying of starvation. Walking through the streets is like being surrounded by beggars. Most are originally decent farmers, driven to beggary by the struggle for survival. They are selling their children. If these babies are not properly nourished during their developmental years, what problems might arise in their future development? We plan to establish a shelter for young children from March to May, after the wheat harvest. This will not only reduce the burden on disaster-stricken families, but also educate and cultivate talent. If you agree, we are willing to do our best.</p>
<h3>Zhou County Magistrate of Jiangpu Comes to Shanghai to Raise Relief Funds</h3>
<p>Jiangpu County suffered a severe drought last year, with nearly 100,000 people starving and displaced. Although various charitable organizations and fellow countrymen from Shanghai provided meager relief, the amount was insufficient for the large number of people in need, like a drop in the bucket. It is reported that when distributing winter relief last month, each extremely impoverished person received only three catties of flour, and those who were less impoverished received only one catty. Now that the spring famine has arrived, disaster victims are scrambling for tree bark and grass roots, eating them until they are nearly gone. They are leading the old and carrying the young, forming groups and heading to the capital to beg for food and porridge, but they cannot even get their fill. Countless numbers are dying of starvation on the way back, or committing suicide at home. The misery is unprecedented. The county magistrate of Jiangpu, Mr. Zhou, is doing his best to plan both work-relief and spring relief programs. He came to Shanghai the day before yesterday with Mr. Lin Chunting, chairman of the county's Chamber of Commerce, to consult with fellow countrymen and appeal to various charitable organizations. In terms of work-relief, the dredging of the Zhikou River will be completed within days. They now plan to continue dredging the Zhu Jia Shan River, which requires over 140,000 yuan. The provincial and county governments will share the responsibility, and there are ways to do this. However, while strong men can work, how can we bear to watch the old and weak die passively? Therefore, spring relief is particularly important. It is reported that Magistrate Zhou has been contacting various parties for spring relief for days, but there are no solutions at the moment. It is hoped that various charitable organizations will consider the severity of the disaster in the county, pay close attention, send people to investigate, and find ways to provide relief.</p>
<h3>Shaoxing National Goods Exhibition to Open on the 10th, Anhui National Exhibition Formally Being Prepared</h3>
<p>The Shaoxing National Goods Exhibition, organized by the Chinese National Products Manufacturers Association, is ready and scheduled to open on the 10th. Liu Zhongying, a standing committee member of the association, left the night before last to go to Shaoxing to arrange the exhibition venue. The Anhui Province Wu-Tun Railway line Products Exhibition, in which the association is participating, has also begun and is officially being prepared. The association has sent a letter to the Anhui Provincial Government, which says:</p>
<p>To the esteemed Anhui Provincial Government:</p>
<p>In order to participate in the Wu-Tun Railway line Products Exhibition hosted by your government, our association has specially dispatched Secretary Zhou Zhaolin to Anhui to investigate the conditions of counties and cities along the railway line, so as to arrange the venue and carry out preparations. He already left on the night of March 5th. This letter is to request that you order the various counties to send personnel to accompany him on his inspection, in order to facilitate progress. Please investigate and reply.</p>
<h3>Nanyang Tobacco Company Dismissal of Workers Incident</h3>
<p>Regarding the recent labor dispute at the Nanyang Tobacco Company, those concerned inquired about the details of the company's dismissal of workers. Here is a record of the Q&amp;A with the company's spokesperson:</p>
<p>Q: Has your company recently dismissed workers? What is the truth of the matter?</p>
<p>A: On the 21st of last month, workers Wang Yuanting and others distributed leaflets, inciting fellow workers. They gathered many people and assembled in the reception room, making various unreasonable demands. The general manager ordered them to go to the office to reason with them, but Wang Yuanting and others refused to go, insisting that the general manager come to the reception room to be surrounded and intimidated. After the chief of engineering, Mr. Pan, repeatedly explained the situation, they still did not repent. From February 22nd to March 1st, they occupied the reception room all day, abandoning their duties. Except for the 24th, which was a Sunday holiday, they continued to be absent from work for six days. Moreover, according to reports from other workers, they forced others to sign their names. An investigation revealed that continuing to be absent from work for six days violates Article 31, Section 2 of the Factory Law. Forcing workers to sign their names violates Article 30, Section 7 of our factory regulations and Article 31, Section 1 of the Factory Law. Therefore, they were legally dismissed on March 1st. As for Ding Xinglong and six others, they were arrested by the Public Works Bureau police for advocating a strike and should also be dismissed according to the law.</p>
<p>Q: When were bonuses established, and what are the details?</p>
<p>A: Bonuses were established to reward employees and were tentatively implemented in the 20th year. This originated from the company's own initiative and is not found in other companies. Therefore, workers who serve our company earn 50% more per year than workers of the same level in other companies. Since the 22nd year, the income and expenditures of this bonus have been audited and publicly announced by accountants hired by our company every year.</p>
<p>Q: Will this bonus continue to be offered in the future?</p>
<p>A: The original plan stated that the bonus was offered on a trial basis. If workers work hard to increase production and the company's business develops accordingly, the trial will be successful, and the company will be happy to maintain it to reward employees. If someone uses it to create trouble, the trial will be unsuccessful, and there will be a need to make changes. Most workers understand where their interests lie, so since this incident, they have all恪守厂规恪守厂规 and worked as usual.</p>
<h3>Three Advertising Companies Host Banquet for the Press</h3>
<p>The three famous advertising companies in this city, United, Viro, and Continental, hosted a banquet at the Wei Ya Restaurant on Fourth Road yesterday to connect with the press. Members of the various departments of the major daily newspapers in this city and all reporters were invited. Ms. Chen Jingfang of Jing Yin Xing Guang Society and all the singing stars also provided friendly performances to add to the fun. Over 200 guests attended, and Mr. Chen Jinghan, Mr. Xu Zhuodai, and others gave speeches (omitted). Toasts were exchanged and laughter filled the room. It was truly an unprecedented gathering for the press and the advertising industry. The party ended happily at 10 PM. The three advertising companies are known for their excellent customer service and their harmonious relationships with the major daily newspapers. They have greatly assisted in the development of industry and commerce and are the leading force in the national advertising industry.</p>
<h3>Travel Agency Opens Three New Hostels: Huangshan, Jinhua, and Xuedou Temple</h3>
<p>The China Travel Agency in this city has been actively building hostels in important cities and scenic spots in the country to facilitate travelers' needs for food and lodging. It is reported that the agency has built hostels in Huangshan in Anhui Province, and in Jinhua and Xuedou Temple in Zhejiang Province. They have now been completed and have begun to accommodate travelers. The facilities are complete, the management is meticulous, and the food is excellent. From now on, travelers to these places will not have to worry about finding suitable places to eat and stay. It is also reported that the agency has brochures for each hostel to give to travelers. Those who wish to visit can contact the agency's Sichuan Road headquarters in advance to request a copy.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Bank Publishes Famous Works on Cooperation</h3>
<p>The Agricultural Department of the Shanghai Commercial and Savings Bank previously convened a meeting in Shanghai of agricultural department staff from various branches to discuss issues such as rural lending and marketing cooperation. During the meeting, they invited cooperation experts Mr. Stephen and Mr. Strand to give multiple lectures. The translations of Mr. Strand's "The Objectives of the Cooperative Movement" and Mr. Stephen's "Various Methods of Marketing Cooperation" have been published in various newspapers. In order to popularize this knowledge of the cooperative movement to all sectors of society, the bank now plans to compile all the speeches of the two gentlemen at the bank into a book and issue it at the lowest possible price. The contents will include twelve speeches, totaling over 100,000 words. However, typesetting and printing will take time, and it will be available to the public around the beginning of next month.</p>
<h3>British Cooperative Sector Pays Attention to Economic Credit Cooperative</h3>
<p>The China Economic Credit Cooperative at 918 Edward Road in this city has been working diligently on the cooperative cause since its establishment on November 11th two years ago. It has earned a reputation at home and abroad. Many people from Europe, America, and Japan have come to visit and inquire. The British Cooperative News, the largest cooperative newspaper in that country, with a circulation of over 100,000 copies, had not previously published news about Chinese cooperatives. It published a brief news item about the cooperative several months ago. Now, on the cooperative's anniversary, the British Cooperative News publishes a lengthy article with a large headline. A summary is translated below for the attention of those concerned about the cooperative cause.</p>
<p>The establishment of the China Economic Credit Cooperative is to solve economic problems for the lower and middle classes. The cooperative was established on November 11, 1933, and was then located at 455 Hankou Road. This newspaper (Cooperative News) published a photo of the cooperative. In the past year, the cooperative has developed rapidly. This time, it moved its office to the building at 918 Edward Road and held an anniversary celebration. Leaders from all walks of life in this city and over 1,000 members attended, making it a grand occasion. According to the plan, Dr. Qiu Hanping gathered dozens of comrades based on his research several years ago. With the assistance of Zhang Shuyong, a senior advisor to the Ministry of Finance, the organization was established. Mr. Zhang is now the chairman of the cooperative and is highly respected. The internal organization of the cooperative is divided into three departments: Savings, Loans, and Mutual Assistance. The Savings Department issues Savings Life Fund Certificates to members in principle, but non-members who wish to enjoy these rights may also do so, subject to approval procedures. These Savings Life Fund Certificates are available in three types: five years, ten years, and fifteen years. The payment methods are divided into a lump sum payment and installment payments, which are affordable for people in the lower and middle classes. The various loans in the Loans Department are particularly novel, but it will be difficult to realize them all in the early stages of establishment. The Mutual Assistance Department provides medical and legal advice, which is in great demand by members in urban areas. In the view of the British cooperative sector, all the plans of the cooperative are novel and feasible, and its development deserves special attention.</p>

By 4:00 PM, over 300 instruments had been calibrated, and the rest will be calibrated today.</p>
<h3>The Second Hu Nan Shelter Ends</h3>
<p>The General Affairs Group of the Shanghai Charity Organization Federation's Hu Nan Shelter announced the end of the second shelter yesterday. The announcement stated that according to Commissioner Lun's instructions, the second shelter would be closed on March 1st. All the residents of the shelter were ordered to leave and seek their own livelihoods. As of the 6th of this month, all have been merged. All supplies, items, and equipment have been inventoried and handed over to the first shelter for safekeeping, in order to show diligence. The notice will be carried out without delay. At the same time, letters were sent to the Red Cross and other organizations requesting continued relief.</p>
<p>The text of the letter is as follows:</p>
<p>To the esteemed organization,</p>
<p>Last winter, our shelter housed a large number of poor people at the Chaozhou Guild Hall on South Station and the Chao Hui Villa on Xietu Road. We are grateful for your donation of 250 bags of rice, which shows your compassion for the poor. Now that the weather is warm in spring, we want the poor people to leave the shelter in succession and seek their own livelihoods, so as to end the operation. However, the market is sluggish, industry and commerce are depressed, and the unemployed still have nowhere to rely on. Therefore, the shelter still houses over 1,000 poor people, but funding is stretched and fundraising is difficult. We consulted with Mr. Wen Lanxiang of your organization the other day for more assistance with rice, and we are very grateful for his willingness to help. Therefore, we are sending this letter to respectfully request the appropriation of aid.</p>
<p>It is reported that the director of the shelter, Zhang Zixin, will send Kong Xianzhang and other poor people who have requested to be sent back to their hometowns to Hankou and other places on the Nisshin Kisen Company's Luoyang Maru ship to return to their villages. There is also a second batch that is planned to be sent within days. They are currently in contact with the shipping company. Each person will be given one yuan for food expenses. There are also 88 disabled poor people who will be sent to the Disabled People's Home for care after the closure, so as to avoid displacement.</p>
<h3>The Creation of the Bank Crash Course</h3>
<p>Modern banking is growing rapidly, but there is a shortage of talent. Although there are many scholars who teach banking, they all use textbooks and do not emphasize experience. Therefore, what is learned cannot be applied and still cannot meet the needs of society. There is now a bank crash course, because the instructors of the course are all experienced bankers, which is completely different from ordinary teaching methods. It is reported that the course has entrusted the Baozhang Law Office in Xinping Lane, Longmen Road, to report the fees to show diligence.</p>

<h3>The Mystery of the Missing Girl: Good Things Turned Into a Bubble, Fiance Requests Termination of Contract</h3>
<p>When Mr. Wu Mengying of Ningbo was studying at Asian Middle School, he got along very well with Wang Yifen, a girl in the junior high school department. After class, they would whisper and were innocent of suspicion. Later, the school organized a music and drama group, and Wu and Wang both joined it. Wu was also elected as the leader. From then on, the two became closer and closer, gradually moving from discussing academics and studying art to engaging in love. By January of last year, both parties believed that their love had reached maturity. Because they both wanted to become lifelong partners and grow old together, they each sought the permission of their parents. On the 23rd of that month, they were formally engaged. In addition to hosting a large banquet, Wu deposited 400 yuan in the Shanghai Bank as a betrothal gift. At that time, Wu had already graduated and was working in a machinery factory. Later, Wu's fiancee transferred to Zhirenyong Girls' School, and Wu was busy with his work, making it difficult for them to meet. They often communicated through letters. Each month, they sent each other over fifty love letters. However, Wu's longing for his fiancee did not diminish. On weekends and holidays, when he heard that the girl had returned home, he would drive to her home at 49 Songpan Road, Yangshupu in the evening to see her. The girl's mother, Zhu, who was over sixty years old with white hair, and her brother, Weide, were both very courteous to Wu. However, on December 3rd of last year, Wu's letter to Yifen revealed a lot of dissatisfaction between the lines. The next night, Wu went to the Wang's house, and he was still talking and laughing with the Wang's mother, daughter, brother, and sister. They thought that Wu's grumbling was due to other feelings, so they didn't care. Wu left at 10 PM that night. Just one hour later, the Wang girl suddenly disappeared. The girl's mother and brother searched all night, but could not find her. The next day, Ding, a tenant of the Wang's family, moved out, causing Wang Zhu to suspect that her daughter's disappearance was related to Ding. She reported the case to the police station in charge, and after investigation, it was determined that Ding had nothing to do with it and should be released from investigation. However, the girl has been missing for several months. Because of this incident, Wu filed a lawsuit with the First Special District District Court to terminate the engagement and requested that Wang Zhu and her three children jointly compensate him for the 950 yuan of losses from the engagement. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Shen Hong examined the case. The plaintiff, Wu Mengying, stated that he was 22 years old and described the engagement. The defendant, Wang Zhu, stated that Yifen was only 19 years old and her whereabouts are still unknown. She did not agree to terminate the engagement and did not want to compensate for the losses. The court then ordered a further hearing at a later date.</p>
<h3>Female Vegetable Vendor Dies Suddenly: Western Police Officer Waves Stick in Chase, Leading to Death, Judge Orders Autopsy to Determine the Cause</h3>
<p>Zhao Qiejia, a 16-year-old local girl living at 67 Zhujiawan, Zhongshan Road, carried baskets with her grandmother, Zhao Zhang (72 years old), to sell vegetables at the entrance of Sandeli Lane, Yichang Road, the day before yesterday. At around 7:00 AM, Western police officer No. 63 from Putuo Road Police Station passed by and intervened, waving his stick to drive them away. Zhao girl fled into the lane and immediately fell to the ground, foaming at the mouth. The police then called the police station and summoned an ambulance, which transported her to Guangren Hospital. The treatment was ineffective and she died soon after. The body was taken to the Féllon Road Morgue for examination. Yesterday morning, Prosecutor Guo Wei, appointed by the First Special District District Court, along with forensic doctors Wei and Zhang, clerk Wang Zuyi, and others, arrived at the morgue to examine the body. Lawyers Ru Baoyi was also sent by the Public Works Bureau to audit the case. First, Prosecutor Guo and others went to the mortuary to carefully inspect the girl's body. Then, they took their seats in the court. According to the Western police chief, Martin, at 7:35 AM yesterday, patrolman No. 62 from our police station was patrolling Yichang Road near Sandeli and saw twenty to thirty women selling vegetables. When they saw the police, they fled into Sandeli Lane. At that time, the Western police officer stood at the entrance of the lane and a Chinese police officer No. 2841 gave him the logbook to sign. Suddenly, an old woman ran out of the lane and told the Chinese police officer that a girl was injured and lying in the lane. The police officer and Western police officer No. 62 followed the old woman to the tributary lane of the third lane and saw a stone slab next to the girl's body, about two feet square and three inches thick, and her right temple was injured by the stone. It was obvious that the girl had tripped over the stone while fleeing. Because the Western police officer was standing at the entrance of the lane, about 53 yards away from where the deceased fell. Later, the girl was sent to the hospital, and it was said that the deceased's mother had given birth to thirteen children, all of whom died one after another. It was said that the child may have died of illness. According to Chinese police officer No. 2841, at about 7:00 AM yesterday, I was also there and saw a Western police officer arrive. Over ten vegetable vendors fled. After I gave the logbook to the Western police officer to sign, an old woman came out of the lane and said that a girl had fallen in the lane. I went to see it with the Western police officer. According to Western police officer No. 62, at about 7:40 AM, I was patrolling Sandeli, Yichang Road and saw many people running into the lane with baskets. At that time, I was standing at the entrance of the lane talking to an old woman. At the same time, the Chinese police officer gave me the logbook to sign. Later, someone ran out and reported that a girl had fallen in the lane. The Chinese police officer entered first, and I followed him, about three feet away. When I got there, I saw that the deceased was being hugged and thrown around by an old woman. I ordered her not to throw her around and put her on the ground. I ordered the Chinese police officer to call an ambulance to take her to the hospital. I saw a big stone next to the girl's body. According to Zhao Zhang, 72 years old, living in Zhujiawan, the deceased was my granddaughter. Yesterday morning, I was selling vegetables with her there. Later, when I saw the Western police officer arrive, he first beat me with a stick and then chased my granddaughter, hitting her on the back of the head. She fell to the ground and could not get up. Prosecutor Guo got the testimony and ordered that the case be autopsied and continued at a later date. The body was handed over to the grandmother of the corpse, Zhao Zhang, who signed a statement to take it back for burial.</p>
<h3>International Kidnapping Ring Leader Accused Again by a Woman - All Due to Financial Matters, Strong Suspicion of Theft</h3>
<p>The Russian named Folandti Menghan Zha (also known as Haige'er), formerly a dentist at No. 83 Beijing Road, and known as the leader of an international kidnapping ring, was arrested for allegedly eloping with Mrs. Haste, the wife of the German Haste, and being involved in the theft of gold ingots and American and Japanese gold coins valued at 7,390 yuan. He was sent to the First Special District Court, questioned several times, and denied the charges. He was then released on bail, as reported in this newspaper. The female defendant, however, remains detained in the police station without bail. Yesterday afternoon, she was brought before English magistrate Kai Xing Ba Ting for continued trial. Jiang Baolian, the lawyer from the Public Works Department, stated that Mrs. Ha had also filed a criminal suit against the defendant, alleging that he had swindled her out of two diamond rings valued at over 1,000 yuan. Subsequently, the criminal suit was withdrawn in court, and a civil suit was pursued. It was found that both rings had been pawned off last year - one in May and the other in August - for a total of 275 yuan. The defendant was very destitute when he first arrived in Shanghai, and it was his compatriot, dentist Kaolaike, who helped him. No. 83 Beijing Road was Kaolaike's clinic, where he rented out rooms and helped purchase dental equipment, etc. After the defendant left Shanghai, he also accumulated debts of several thousand yuan. He is now in court. Furthermore, a woman named Bailatuo was also allegedly swindled out of 170 silver yuan and borrowed a watch that was damaged. She had to pay a few yuan for repairs but could not afford to retrieve it, demonstrating that the defendant was penniless. According to Kaolaike's statement, he met the defendant in October of the year before last. At that time, he rented three rooms of his medical office and bedroom for 160 yuan per month and also guaranteed the dental equipment, materials, and loans, totaling over 3,300 yuan by January of this year. He left without notice. Previously, he saw a key being filed in the kitchen. Although he didn't see it himself, Zhang Zifu from the pawnshop mentioned it. According to the woman Bailatuo, 28 years old, a Russian from Gagaliri, she was a nurse at a hospital on Haining Road. In May of last year, she met the defendant through a friend. He borrowed money from her twice, totaling 170 yuan. At the end of the year, when she resigned, she asked for the repayment. He often falsely claimed that he wanted to marry her and said that his parents had asked a friend working as a sailor on an Italian ship to bring 500-600 yuan to Shanghai to buy gold leaves. One day, he admitted that he was a bad person and that she would find out in the future. According to the plaintiff's wife, Mrs. Ha, the stolen property was the joint property of her and her husband, and the theft had caused them both losses. She only learned about it when she was detained in Qingdao. Initially, she was accused of stealing it and it was said that the defendant had borrowed her two diamond rings and pawned them off. Questioned, the defendant admitted that he owed Kaolaike over 1,000 yuan, excluding the installments he had paid. As for the loan from Bailatuo, he promised to repay her later, without affecting their marriage prospects. She wanted to marry him but it did not happen, and she said bad things about him. As for the two diamond rings from Mrs. Ha, he admitted to borrowing and pawning them. He was evasive about the rest. The magistrate, suspecting the defendant of theft, ordered him to remain under his original bail and scheduled another hearing.</p>
<h3>Feeding a Child Steel Needles - Wet Nurse Sentenced to One Year</h3>
<p>Mrs. Shi Gao, a woman from Ningbo, was hired as a wet nurse by Mrs. Zhang Dong, a fellow villager residing in the factory dormitory of Shenxin No. 9 Factory on Macau Road. Because her milk was scarce, she was scolded by the employer. She then took her anger out on the child, secretly placing a broken steel needle into the child's mouth. When this was discovered, she was fired by the employer, who also reported it to the police. She was detained and sent to the First Special District Court. The details of the interrogation have been reported in the previous newspaper. It is now known that the child was sent to the hospital for an X-ray examination, and no damage was found in the abdomen. Yesterday morning, magistrate Liu brought the defendant to court again. At the conclusion of the hearing, Shi Gao was sentenced to one year of imprisonment as a warning.</p>
<h3>Using Green Wire to Insulate Electric Meter - Stealing Over 2,000 Yuan Worth of Electricity - Court Issues Arrest Warrant for Zhang Ziyun</h3>
<p>Zhang Ziyun, a local resident who deals in real estate and lives at No. 89-91 Zhangjiazhai Road, Xinzha, was discovered on the 25th of last month by the Shanghai Electric Power Company, who sent Chinese and Western staff to Zhang's house to replace the electricity meter. They noticed that the meter's coil was insulated with insulated wire, preventing the current from registering and indicating theft of electricity. They notified the Chinese and Western detectives of the Xinzha police station, who investigated and found that Zhang had been stealing electricity continuously from January 1933 to the end of February this year, amounting to 2,193.78 yuan. They removed the meter and took it back to the police station. They also reported to the First Special Court, which issued an arrest warrant for Zhang Ziyun to be questioned yesterday morning. However, Zhang himself did not appear, and attorney Fan Gang appeared in court, stating that Zhang was in Guangdong and that the house was occupied by a woman named Tang Peiyu. Tang has now surrendered herself; please interrogate her. After the police lawyer Zhang Shizhu presented the case, Magistrate Ye Shengchao, because Zhang failed to appear, ordered an arrest warrant to be issued. The case was postponed for seven days.</p>
<h3>Escape During Transfer of a Prisoner from Tanziwan Police Station - One Person Arrested on the Spot - Three Accomplices Captured - Wu Kaijue Surrenders Himself</h3>
<p>At around 10 PM the night before last, the Tanziwan police station of the Zhabei Xinzha branch received a report from Jiang Zongtang, a clerk at a drug store at No. 23 Jiaotong West Road, stating that thieves had stolen clothing and other items from his store. Inspector Li Qingjie immediately dispatched patrol officer Lu Huaigong and policeman Yuan Yao, who arrested two suspects, Wu Kaijue and Sun Jinhong, and brought them to the station for questioning. At 3:10 PM yesterday afternoon, a document was prepared, and policeman Lu Wenxing and others were assigned to escort them to the Xinzha branch. Unexpectedly, when passing the railway crossing, several people suddenly arrived and seized the two prisoners. The police were outnumbered and had their uniforms and shoulder straps torn. Fortunately, someone reported it to the Tanziwan police station, which dispatched a large number of police officers who captured one person. While taking him to the station for questioning, three accomplices of the prisoner, posing as onlookers, came to inquire and were also arrested. The arrested prisoner confessed to being Wu San, 32 years old, from Yancheng, residing in a thatched shed on Jiaotong Road. Wu Kaijue was his younger brother. Bao Genpei and Li Xiaofuzi were Wu San's friends. Another person, Ling Yangsheng, claimed that he did not know Wu and the others and was mistakenly arrested. Later, the plaintiff Jiang Zongtang and policeman Lu Wenxing gave testimonies similar to the above. Inspector Li immediately ordered them to be sent to the Xinzha branch. During the investigation, Wu San was ordered to hand over his younger brother Wu Kaijue, and Wu Kaijue, along with Sun Jinhong, surrendered themselves. The case is currently under investigation.</p>
<h3>Assassination of a Female Hostess - Record of the Suspect's Trial - Arrest by Police Based on Report - Defendant Vigorously Denies Any Involvement</h3>
<p>Xu Meiying, a 28-year-old woman from Jiangwan and a hostess at the Daxing class No. 1 in the Xinxin Company amusement park, residing at No. 88 Jin Shenfu Road in the French Concession, was suddenly strangled to death in her apartment between 9 and 10 AM on the first of this month while she was still in bed. A man, around 30 years old and wearing short clothes, broke into her apartment, strangled her, and stole the gold jewelry she was wearing. At noon, Xu's lover, Gu Xiaodi, returned to the apartment for lunch and discovered the body. He reported it to the French police and requested the arrest of the murderer. At 12:30 PM on the day before yesterday, French police detectives Zhou Bingcheng and Tao Ronglin arrested a person named Xue Xiaodi at the Xile Teahouse at the intersection of Caishi Road and Ximen Road and brought him back to the police station for investigation. The details were reported in yesterday's newspaper. Yesterday at noon, the police sent Xue to the Criminal Division 1 of the Second Special Court, where he was interrogated by Magistrate Li Changnian. Xue stated that he was 32 years old, from Pudong, residing at No. 4 Majili, Chongqing Road, and worked as a mason. The police lawyer Fei Xizhen presented the case, stating that the defendant was arrested for premeditated murder, the case was complicated, and he requested a postponement of two weeks for further investigation. Detective Tao Ronglin reported that the plaintiff came to the police station to report that the witnesses said the murderer was wearing a short coat and blue cloth pants, and claimed that the defendant had previously been involved with the deceased and lived at No. 6 Deqingli, Annajin Road, but they had separated for about seven or eight months. At that time, the defendant prevented the deceased from living with Gu Xiaodi and threatened to kill Gu Xiaodi and the deceased. Based on this report, the police arrested the defendant and requested a postponement for detailed investigation. Questioned, Xue Xiaodi stated that he went to the Xinxin Company last January and had tea made by the deceased Xu Meiying. He went there often afterwards, but stopped going in November because he had no money. Now that she has been killed and he is accused of murder, it is really unfair. Xue's defense lawyer stated that although the case was serious, there was no evidence against the defendant and it was a false accusation. He requested that the defendant be allowed to post bail. The court denied the request for bail and adjourned the hearing to the morning of the 15th. The defendant was returned to custody.</p>
<h3>Preparing Wills - Attempting Suicide in a Hotel - One Dead, Two Saved - Mostly Due to Economic Pressure</h3>
<p>Zhang Yiming of the Pacific Hotel: At around 9 PM the night before last, a young male traveler named Zhang Yiming, 28 years old, a local businessman, arrived at the Pacific Hotel at No. 430 Guangxi Road. He took room No. 32. After entering the room, he wrote two letters, one to a friend in Lao Ximen and one to his family, and asked the tea server to mail them. Shortly after, he went out alone and brought a modern woman back with him. At around 12 AM, the woman left, and the young man went to sleep, telling the tea server not to disturb him. Yesterday at noon, the tea server asked him if he wanted to extend his stay. The young man said to extend it for one more day. Unexpectedly, less than half an hour after the tea server left and checked back in, he found the young man lying stiff on the bed, barely breathing. The hotel accountant immediately reported it to the police, who sent a detective to investigate. They found the young man wearing a small white hat, a black cloth jacket, a patriotic cloth cotton robe, and white socks and white shoes, as if in mourning attire. He was taken to Renji Hospital but died before arrival. The body was sent to the morgue to await examination by the court.</p>
<p>Chen Chaosheng of the Yangtze Hotel: At 2:30 PM the day before yesterday, a young male traveler claiming to be Chen Chaosheng, 23 years old, from Anhui, arrived at the Yangtze Hotel on Hankou Road. He took room No. 411 on the fourth floor. He closed the door and went to sleep alone. Yesterday at noon, when the tea server called him as usual, he found Chen pale and unable to speak, realizing that he had taken poison. He immediately reported it to the accountant, who reported it to the police. Chen was taken to Renji Hospital, where he was given emergency treatment. According to the doctor's diagnosis, he had swallowed raw opium, but fortunately the amount was small and his life was in danger. When the police sent a detective to investigate, they found two letters on the table, one to his family and one to the Yangtze manager, expressing his apologies. The reason for his suicide was said to be due to economic pressure.</p>
<p>Huang Rongjiu of the World Hotel: At the end of November of last year, a traveler claiming to be Huang Rongjiu, 30 years old, from Suzhou, who dealt in firewood and charcoal, arrived at the World Hotel at the corner of Xizang Road and Aiduya Road. He took room No. 39 and has been living there for almost two months. Initially, there was nothing unusual, but yesterday at around 8 AM, a traveler in the room next to Huang's suddenly heard a strange noise from Huang's room. He quickly called the tea server, who managed to pry open room No. 39. They found Huang lying on the bed, unconscious and breathing heavily, clearly having taken poison. They immediately telegraphed the police, who sent him to Renji Hospital for treatment. It was said that he had taken only a small amount of poison and his life was in danger. On the table in his room, there was a letter to his father, stating that he was taking this drastic measure due to economic hardship.</p>
<h3>The Zhenru Apprentice's Tragic Death Case - Forensic Examination Concludes He Died from Water Injected into Lungs - Trial Opens Yesterday for Zhenru Police Station Chief and Others Prosecuted</h3>
<p>Zhu Jianqiu, a Hunanese who ran a home food business below the Zhenru Radio Station, was detained by the station's household registration officer, who claimed the population report was inaccurate. Zhu's apprentice, Gu Fulang, was first detained in the station. The next day, Zhu himself surrendered to the station to exchange the apprentice for release. Because Zhu was straightforward and spoke frankly, he was beaten and even had a large amount of water poured into his nose. When his complexion changed, he was helped out by the police and put on a rickshaw. Students Hong Xingchi and five others from Southeast Medical College, after learning that he was beaten, had Zhu Jianqiu immediately sent to their hospital.</p>
<p>He died after ineffective treatment. His younger brother, Zhu Shiying, reported the incident and requested the Nanshi District Court to send someone to examine the body. Although there were injuries, they were not fatal, and the cause of death was unclear. Later, the judge ordered the body to be sent to the Zhenru Forensic Research Institute for an autopsy. The examination determined that the deceased had a large amount of water injected into his lungs, which caused his death. A letter was sent to the court, and prosecutor Lei Binzhang questioned and confirmed the facts, regarding the defendants Zhou Pingyuan (Chief of Zhenru Police Station), Xing Guonong (Officer of the Police Station), Zhang Zhizhong (Head of Household Registration Section of the Police Station), Liu Mingqi, Ma Xiantu (Police of Household Registration Section), as guilty of crimes.

<h3>Yan'an Road: Suspected Red and White Powder Seized; Shen Jinkui, Ye Changlin, and Others Sent for Investigation</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning at 5:20 AM, as dawn was breaking, police watchman Cai Chuncheng from the 10th watch post of the Old North Gate discovered Shen Jinkui, Liu Fuliang, and Wang Dagou engaging in suspicious secret talks at No. 187 Yan'an Road. He immediately approached them for questioning. According to Shen Jinkui, No. 16 in that alley was a clandestine red pill manufacturing operation, and he had already reported this to Inspector Wang. Police Officer Cai immediately returned to the station to report this. Station Chief Shen then dispatched patrol officers Qi Bin and Zhang Lantian, leading police chief Liu Guangyi and others, to the location. Shen Jinkui and the others led them to the house in question for inspection. According to Ye Changlin (24 years old, from Jiangyin), who was inside the house, he was a clerk at the Shanghai Chemical Industrial Company, and the owner was Shen Shanchang, who did not come to the shop. After searching everywhere, no evidence of red pills was found. However, substances resembling raw materials for red pills, such as red and white powder, as well as sugar powder, rouge, and foreign soap, were seized. The shop clerk Ye Changlin, along with the informant Shen Jinkui and two others, were taken to the Old North Gate Police Station for questioning. After interrogation by Station Chief Shen, Shen Jinkui and the others jointly testified that the house was secretly manufacturing illegal items, and some people said they were making poison pills. When questioned, the defendant Ye Changlin was evasive. It was decided that the seized red and white powder and other items resembling raw materials for red pills should be sent for chemical analysis to determine if they were poisonous substances. Since the matter involved criminal charges, Shen Jinkui and the others should also be handed over to the General Bureau for further interrogation.</p>
<h3>The Great Shanghai Bank Sues Qian Guanxian; Qian Guanxian Found Not Guilty</h3>
<p>Qian Guanxian from Ningbo used to work as a runner for the Great Shanghai Bank on Nanjing Road and also partnered with Chai Fugui, the former manager of the Jiande Bank, to open the Deyu Securities Firm on Hankou Road. This firm had dealings with the Great Shanghai Bank and had a 5,000-yuan credit overdraft. Last year, the firm suffered losses due to customer defaults, resulting in a debt of 4,461.19 yuan to the Great Shanghai Bank. The bank later discovered that Deyu had gone bankrupt and reported Qian for breach of trust to the Old Zhabei Police Station. After being arrested and brought before the First Special Court, Qian Guanxian argued that Deyu had frequent dealings with the Great Shanghai Bank, and that last year's transactions with the bank amounted to over 200,000 yuan. Furthermore, although Deyu had suffered some losses, it was still in operation and its accounts could be audited. The Great Shanghai Bank falsely accused him of bankruptcy and reported him to the police. The defendant intended to file a counterclaim, as the case was entirely a civil matter and the prosecution was deliberately using criminal charges. He requested to be declared not guilty and was defended by lawyer Fan Gang. After inquiry by the judge, Qian was found not guilty. The police also declared yesterday that they would withdraw the appeal and requested that Qian's bail be canceled.</p>
<h3>The Assassination of Tang Jiapeng; Wang Xinggao's Case Re-examined</h3>
<p>Tang Jiapeng, also known as Tang A Yu, the former manager of the Great World amusement park, was suddenly shot and killed by thugs in front of the Great World on the morning of June 18, 1933, at around 1:00 AM. At the same time, a stray bullet killed a pedestrian, Wu Guangcai. Recently, based on a confession from Zhao Huangfu, a Yangzhou native who had already been sentenced to life imprisonment, the French police arrested Wang Xinggao from Funing, a suspect as the mastermind behind the case. He was transferred to the Second Court, and a public prosecution was initiated against him for premeditated murder. Judge Xiong Huitui held repeated hearings and sent a document to the Hubei High Court to investigate Wang's employment history at the No. 1 Prison in Wuchang. Due to incomplete witness testimonies, the court ordered a postponement for further hearings. These details have been reported in previous issues. Yesterday was the date for the continued hearing. However, Judge Xiong, who was originally presiding over the case, was transferred to the Third Branch of the High Court. Therefore, Judge Sun Peng, accompanied by Clerk Tao Zongkan, came to the Second Criminal Court yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM to hear the case. Lawyer Gu Shouxi appeared on behalf of the Police Department. Defense lawyers Shen Xingxia and Huang Qikai, hired by the defendant, also arrived on time. The court ordered Wang Xinggao to be brought to the court and declared that the case would be re-examined. First, the police lawyer presented the main points of the prosecution. Then, Wang Xinggao was questioned about the circumstances of Tang Jiapeng's death. Wang replied that he did not know, as he was working at the No. 1 Prison in Hubei at that time. His other statements were the same as before (previously reported and not repeated here). Next, witnesses Wu Xuedong and Shen Yousheng were called to the stand. Wu testified that he was 48 years old, from Yancheng, and lived at No. 3 Quanlu Lane, Hengfeng Road, Zhabei, and worked as an actor. Shen Yousheng testified that he was 57 years old, from Xuzhou, and lived at No. 1024 Maigen Road, and ran a teahouse. The court ordered both to swear an oath and instructed Wu to copy the oath once and write a number for handwriting comparison. After Wu finished writing, the court ordered Wang to be taken down and questioned Wu Xuedong. Wu testified that although he had known Wang Xinggao (who lived at No. 4 of the same lane) for seven or eight years as neighbors in Quanlu Lane, they did not see each other often. He often performed in other cities and did not know that Wang had been arrested for the murder case. Wang's family had not asked him to do anything, nor had he visited Zhao Guangfu in the detention center. Wu was asked if he had written a letter to Zhao and was shown the letter to read. Wu replied that he had not written it, nor had he visited Wang Xinggao in the detention center. Shen Yousheng testified that he had been running Huaxing Teahouse for seven or eight years and had many customers, but he did not know Zhao Guangfu, nor was Zhao his apprentice. He was asked if Zhao had a letter on September 26 to be handed to Wang Xinggao. He replied no, but running a teahouse and delivering letters for others was not surprising. At this point, Zhao Guangfu was ordered to be brought to the stand. He said that Zhou, a carpenter, told him about the killing of Tang, and that Wang Jinkui had a grudge against him and wanted revenge. He had met Wang once, and the harm to Wang Xinggao was actually because of a woman. He did not know the Wu Xuedong and Shen Yousheng in the case. He had previously asked someone to write a letter to Wu Shaoming while in the detention center, and Wu had visited him twice in the detention center. He was asked, "Zhao, you previously said Wang Jinkui was Wang Xinggao. Have you now reached an agreement outside? Did your family receive money in December last year, was it 600 yuan or 5,000 yuan?" Zhao replied, "No." The court then brought Wang Xinggao back for questioning and then announced that it had just taken over the case yesterday and needed to study the contents, and would schedule another hearing at a later date. Wang was returned to custody.</p>
<h3>Protecting the Ancient Pagoda of Longhua Temple; Peach Blossoms Along the Route Will Soon Be in Full Bloom, the Incense Pilgrimage is Approaching Again; Strict Prohibition of Unscrupulous Acts by Chinese and Foreign Visitors</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau, to protect the ancient pagoda of Longhua Temple, and at the same time, as the peach blossoms along the route to the temple are about to bloom, and the incense pilgrimage season is approaching again, has specifically posted Public Notice No. 2, stating: "Longhua Temple in this city is one of the most famous Buddhist monasteries, founded during the Sun Wu period of the Three Kingdoms. The pagoda outside the temple is ancient, and its age and verifiable history are recorded in various books. As a local scenic and historical site, it should be given special protection. Every spring, during the incense pilgrimage season and when the peach blossoms along the route are in bloom, the number of Chinese and foreign visitors is extremely large and crowded. To prevent unscrupulous individuals from causing disturbances inside and outside the temple, strict measures must be taken to maintain order and security. In addition to instructing the Caojing Police Station to comply with these measures, this public notice is hereby issued to inform all citizens to abide by them. Anyone who dares to deliberately disrupt the peace, disturb order, or engage in unlawful acts inside or outside Longhua Temple will be arrested and severely punished without leniency. This notice is hereby issued on February 28, 1935."</p>
<h3>Wanted Murderer, "Flower Tailor," Sentenced to Seven Years</h3>
<p>"Flower Tailor," also known as Yan Zhi, from Anhui Province, lived at No. 12 Puaifang, Zhoujiapai Road. He recently had a dispute with his neighbor and fellow townsman, Qin Maobiao, over a debt of three yuan in silver dollars. On the fourth day of the first lunar month, he assaulted Qin Maobiao. "Flower Tailor" then fled to a friend's place in Zitengbang, Minhang. On the 14th of last month, he came to Shanghai for some business. At around 9:00 PM, while walking near Ningwu Road and Haizhou Road, he ran into Qin Maobiao. The two enemies crossed paths and started arguing again. As a result of the mutual assault, they both fell into a small river. Qin suffered serious injuries and managed to climb ashore, but then collapsed and died. "Flower Tailor" fled back to Minhang. Later, Chinese Detective Zhang Yunjian of the Yangshupu Police Station arrested him and brought him before the First Special District Court for questioning. The details of the interrogation have been reported in this newspaper. After the final arguments, the court awaited the verdict. Yesterday morning, Judge Wu Zehan, presiding over the Third Criminal Court, sentenced "Flower Tailor" to seven years in prison. The number of days spent in pre-trial detention would be deducted from the sentence at a rate of two days for every day of imprisonment.</p>
<h3>Dong Wenli Reports Being Falsely Accused; Requests Justice from All Sectors; Upholding Citizens' Legal Rights and Human Rights</h3>
<p>Dong Wenli, a standing committee member of the Fourth District Branch of the Second Special District Citizens' Association, was illegally searched by the French police on the night of February 10th, under the suspicion of running a gambling den. Fearing that the true situation may be unclear to all sectors, he issued a report to various organizations yesterday, outlining the circumstances. The report is transcribed below:</p>
<p>Regarding the report, Dong Wenli, a standing committee member of this association, is 37 years old and a native of Yancheng, Jiangsu. He operates the Yuanyuan Secondhand Goods Market and the Yuanyuan Teahouse between Pingjili Road and Bai'er Road in the French Concession of Shanghai and also manages part of the Zhenhe Tea Warehouse property on Pingjili Road. He has been doing business in Shanghai for several decades, always acting fairly and treating people with sincerity, so everyone is happy to interact with him. The incident occurred on the night of February 12th, around 8:00 PM, when Inspector Qian Chenglong of the French police, leading several Chinese and foreign detectives in three cars, arrived at Wang Shunxing Wood Shop at No. 206 Pingjili Road to search for gambling. Without asking for any explanation, they went straight upstairs. At the time, four friends and relatives of the tenants upstairs, who were in the secondhand goods business, were playing mahjong for recreation, as they had nothing else to do during the Lunar New Year holiday. Seeing the detectives arrive, they immediately stopped playing. The detectives entered the room, stating that mahjong was not prohibited and instructing the four not to panic and to continue playing. Several detectives stood watching the mahjong game, while the rest searched each room for over an hour.</p>
<p>No evidence of gambling was found. They then went downstairs. At this time, besides the four friends and relatives of the tenants upstairs who were still playing mahjong, the shop's employees and apprentices were already asleep downstairs. The detectives went to the apprentices' beds (two apprentices sleeping in the same bed). Inspector Qian Chenglong immediately dragged one of the apprentices, Wang Xizhi, out of bed. The apprentice was young and did not know why he was being dragged out by the detectives. In a state of panic, he fell to the ground and cried loudly. The inspector then let go of this apprentice and dragged out another apprentice, Wang Wenqing (a newcomer to Shanghai from Shandong), who was 18 years old. He immediately raised a gun and threatened him, saying, "Do you know where the gambling den is? Tell me quickly!" The apprentice (who did not speak Shanghainese) replied that he did not know. Before he could finish speaking, the inspector began to punch and kick him arbitrarily. Alas, what crime had the apprentice committed to deserve such an unexpected disaster? After being beaten, he was handcuffed and taken upstairs. Inspector Qian pointed at the four people and said they were gambling, and then threatened them with a gun, forcing the four to say that Dong Wenli ran the gambling den. He also beat them individually and handcuffed them before detaining them in the special room of the police station. They were then given brutal whippings and strictly interrogated. Because there were no facts to support the accusations, they were forced to confess that Dong ran the gambling den and to admit that they were gambling. At the time, the four insisted on answering truthfully, saying that the facts were absolutely not as described. The inspector, seeing that there was no opportunity to exploit, confined the young apprentice in a room and threatened him with extreme punishment, saying, "If you say that Dong Wenli runs the gambling den, I will release you. Otherwise, I will subject you to torture," etc. The young and ignorant apprentice, having suffered from the beatings and now facing confinement and the threat of punishment, could only answer in the affirmative. As a result, Inspector Qian wrote down a confession and forced him to sign it. The four detainees and the apprentice were only released the next day. On the evening of the incident, Dong Wenli was attending a banquet at a friend's invitation and was not at home. The next day, February 13th, the police sent a large number of detectives to search Dong's residence, teahouse, and shop, but found nothing. They then sent four detectives to station at the two shops for surveillance, only withdrawing them on the 15th of this month. Dong Wenli is a legitimate businessman. This false accusation of gambling and the inspector's coercion to falsely accuse the innocent are evidenced by what Dong said: "Several years ago, Qian's younger brother stole items from a secondhand goods stall and shops on Pingjili Road and was scolded by Dong. Later, he committed another crime and died in a public concession prison. Therefore, Qian harbors resentment." This abuse of power for personal revenge is conceivable. In order to maintain the legal rights of its members and respect the human rights of citizens, this association has no choice but to negotiate based on reason. The above is a report of the circumstances. We request that all sectors uphold justice. Furthermore, the French police often search the residences of people within the concession without a search warrant from the court. This is detrimental to the legal rights and human rights of our citizens. This association will be endlessly grateful if the legal rights and human rights of our Chinese citizens can be protected. We respectfully request your consideration.</p>
<h3>Recent Affairs of the Ningbo Fellow-Villagers Association</h3>
<p>Since the renovation of all the premises of the Ningbo Fellow-Villagers Association in Shanghai was completed, the offices of various departments have also been restored to their original state, and various association affairs are being actively carried out. The newly built clinic and reading room have been relocated and opened, providing convenience and comfort for fellow villagers seeking medical treatment or reading newspapers. The second scholarship of the Siming University Scholarship, organized by the association, has also completed the review of the students' transcripts for the last semester and will be sent out in order.

<p>Guanshengyuan's Newly Made Chocolate Biscuits: Few domestic factories produce chocolate biscuits. In recent years, these foods have come from imports, with prices around three yuan per pound.

The center of the biscuits is filled with a sandwich, and the flavor is good enough to compete with imported products. Currently, to clear inventory, the original price of one yuan and five jiao per pound is being offered at half price for several days, selling for only seven jiao and five fen per pound.

<h3>Discussion on Sino-Japanese Economic Cooperation (Continued 3)</h3>
<p>— Mu Ouchu</p>
<p>The reduction in imports included grains, miscellaneous grains and flour, totaling 162,796,283 yuan; soap and fats, totaling 59,018,265 yuan; cotton fabrics (excluding cotton yarn), totaling 34,473,981 yuan; other metals, totaling 19,663,115 yuan; coal and fuel, totaling 11,297,641 yuan; chemicals and pharmaceuticals, totaling 9,741,967 yuan; sugar, totaling 9,562,471 yuan; cotton, totaling 8,711,043 yuan; silk and silk fabrics, totaling 6,212,590 yuan; books, maps, paper, etc., totaling 6,327,863 yuan.</p>
<p>Due to economic panic and other various factors, it is difficult to make simple judgments based on the numbers listed above. However, from the increased imports, the largest being machinery and other similar products, it is clear that China is in urgent need of commodities for production. Although there are many complex factors involved in the reduction of imports, the decrease in cotton fabrics, paper, and other items cannot but be said to be partly due to the substitution of domestic industrial products. This further proves that China's light industry is developing and domestic industry is on the rise. However, the key question arises: If domestic industry is developing, what difficulties will Chinese domestic industry encounter if Japanese goods are allowed to run rampant in the Chinese market? Let us then examine what commodities Japan is exporting to our country. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>The Illusion of Art</h3>
<p>— Li Bo</p>
<p>Almost all Romantic works, especially poetry, are built upon unrestrained fantasies, exaggerated lines, rich colors, wondrous plots, and the "golden dreams" that evoke reverie. These qualities of Romanticism are not found in nature or the human world as they exist. They are all products of the creator's subjective imagination.</p>
<p>The world surrounding Romanticists is often filled with ugliness and ordinariness. The circumstances and objects that serve as raw materials for art are almost always accumulations of valueless, colorless impurities. On the surface, no artistic beauty is visible, let alone the dreams of humanity. Only through the creator's refinement and exaggeration can these raw materials become Romantic products containing all of these elements. If we regard the product as the solution of art and the creator as the furnace, then imagination is the primary fuel of this furnace.</p>
<p>However, the illusion of art is not only important to Romanticism. It also plays a significant role in the creative activities of extreme "Naturalism" and strict Realism. Zola, the master of "Naturalism" who advocated for dealing with reality with documentary faithfulness, also said that his so-called reality is "reality glimpsed through a prism of emotion." Are the multi-faceted, brilliant things seen through this prism not part of our imagination?</p>
<p>Imagination often causes natural phenomena and human life, reflected in people's minds, to become even more vivid and sharp than actual existence. This point is even more clearly expressed in poetry and cartoons.</p>
<p>Within the realm of Realism, imagination often allows us to grasp reality more firmly and influence it more powerfully. Without understanding this point, the fantastical conceptions of many great Realists—such as Gogol's frequent appearances of ghosts and monsters—cannot be explained.</p>
<p>Perhaps some will say that progressive Realism does not rely on imagination. This view is very mechanical. The veins of all progressive Realists often contain Romantic elements, and therefore they cannot be separated from imagination. In fact, Realism without elements of imagination can never satisfy the needs of new social strata. Gorky solemnly tells us: "In the art of creating language, in the art of creating various characters and types, imagination and intuition, 'fantasy' are necessary." Vladimir strongly advocates for ensuring the "right to dream."</p>
<p>Progressive Realists must not only express and grasp reality, but most importantly, they must elevate it; they must "deepen and expand our understanding of humanity and life." They must "complete the missing links in the chain of undiscovered facts." Without rich imagination, even fantasy, none of this is possible. In this sense, one can apply the famous saying: "A practitioner who cannot dream is a bad practitioner."</p>
<p>Of course, we must clearly distinguish between two different functions of imagination. In regressive Romanticism, imagination often has a "morbid escape" effect on reality. It is always a poisonous substance that paralyzes and corrupts the vitality of life. But in progressive Romanticism and even Realism, imagination always maintains the basic tone of reality, not only exerting a full effect of illuminating and enriching reality but also providing brilliant practical ideals.</p>
<p>However, imagination sometimes contradicts reality. Imagination wants to lead people to "obscure distances," even to lead people to "castles in the air." Isn't this poisoning reality? Regarding this question, Pisarev said it best:</p>
<p>"The contradiction between dream and reality, if the dreamer on the one hand truly believes in his dream, pays attention to staring deeply at reality, and on the other hand compares his observation of reality with his castles in the air, in a word, is willing to honestly work hard for the realization of his dream, as long as this is the case, there will be no poisoning. When there is any contact between imagination and reality, everything will proceed smoothly."</p>
<h3>Going to School</h3>
<p>— Chen Fuxi</p>
<p>Upon entering school, Yu Zhizhang burst into tears.</p>
<p>He was a second-year high school student, about twenty years old, but he was always as innocent as a child. This time, leaving home, he truly felt a deep sense of separation. Now, having entered the school, alone in the cold and desolate dormitory, his heart was filled with unresolvable melancholy. Thinking of his parents, he felt that for twenty years he had received their most sincere love every day, and once separated, this love was often more easily reflected in Yu Zhizhang's memory. Leaving home was indeed bitter. As the rickshaw turned past his father, he saw sweat streaming down his father's forehead, who was returning from somewhere, carrying something in his hands.</p>
<p>"Be careful on the road, don't worry about things at home..."</p>
<p>His father said these words, and the rickshaw finally pulled away. Yu Zhizhang looked back, only seeing his father's white hair shining in the morning sun.</p>
<p>"Father is really getting old!"</p>
<p>He thought on the rickshaw, tears that hadn't flowed for several years suddenly streaming down... Thinking of his parents' aging was a great concern to Yu Zhizhang, and he wished he could immediately start a family and establish a career, so that his parents could have a better life in their later years. His mother's health had been deteriorating day by day for the past three or four years. Her hair was originally long, black, and thick, but now it often fell out, filling the comb. Moreover, not only was it falling out, but the few sparse strands of hair were gradually turning white. Her memory was poor, her appetite had decreased, and she often had headaches, backaches, and blurred vision. These were all symbols of poor health. As for his father? His father's body was much stronger than his mother's, but due to the whip of life, he was often humiliated by the gentry. He originally had a shop, but even that shop was now closed. He had never enjoyed a day of pleasant life. His father's middle age was bitter, and in his old age, his life was still so bleak...</p>
<p>Given his family's situation, under the collapsing economy of a small bourgeoisie, logically, he could only bury and sacrifice his talent like most people, becoming a basic shop apprentice and living that soulless, slave-like life. Yet Yu Zhizhang was actually able to study in high school, and he himself already felt satisfied, even though his tuition for each semester was all borrowed. Before he went to school this time, his father said:</p>
<p>"How will Zhizhang's tuition be raised?"</p>
<p>"Go to our son-in-law's place again and see if we can find a way..." his mother said.</p>
<p>"Borrow it?"</p>
<p>"Of course, borrow it."</p>
<p>"..."</p>
<p>His father didn't speak, and his face became even more gloomy, shrouded in a miserable melancholy. He seemed unsure about borrowing money this time, perhaps because he had borrowed it several times before and found it difficult to ask again. The lamp in the room hung in a long silence. His father was very sad and depressed, willing to cultivate his son with the only property he had for the sake of his son's education. So the next day, after his father ran around everywhere and was disappointed, he had no choice but to mortgage the old, dilapidated house they lived in.</p>
<p>"We have to mortgage the house!"</p>
<p>His father said.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, a gloomy afternoon, as he wrote the mortgage deed in the living room, his father's face became even more depressed and miserably severe. In Yu Zhizhang's life, he had never seen his father so sorrowful. This dilapidated house was his grandfather's legacy, and it was also the house where his father had grown up since childhood. He had a deep love for this house, and that loving heart made him reluctant to mortgage it.</p>
<p>Although his father's face was unusually gloomy, once the contract was written and he received the mortgage money from the other party, the old father finally smiled again, as if he had already forgotten about mortgaging the house.</p>
<p>"We have the money, Zhizhang can go to school tomorrow..."</p>
<p>As he spoke, his father handed Zhizhang sixty dollars in banknotes. Zhizhang took the money and went to school, but when he thought about the source of the money, his tears flowed like the plum rains.</p>
<h3>Memories of a Terrifying Life (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Lan Ru</p>
<p>When the Northern Army retreated, they passed our house for three days and three nights. My mother originally didn't want to run away, but because of my constant pleading by myself, my third brother, and my older sister, she finally fled with us to the home of my grandmother's niece, my cousin. This place was in a mountain hollow, six miles away from my house. My mother had to climb to the top of the mountain several times a day to look, and when she came back, she always told us in tears: "The old house has been burned down, and now they are burning the terrace. Although our house still exists, it will be gone in a moment!"</p>
<p>"They might even burn this place. I heard that Wangjiachong has already killed forty or fifty people, and all the houses have been burned down."</p>
<p>My cousin also sighed.</p>
<p>"When they come here, we shouldn't run away. Let's all die together. I can't bear to leave my children."</p>
<p>Saying this, my mother couldn't help but cry. We were also moved by these words and shed tears.</p>
<p>"Humph! Not leave? It's too dangerous!" My cousin-in-law said in alarm. "In Lijiaping, an eight-year-old girl and a pregnant woman about to give birth were both raped to death! These things are worse than beasts, even more ruthless than bandits. Even a hundred-year-old woman will be destroyed the same way."</p>
<p>"A life for a life, why not resist?" my sister said.</p>
<p>"Mom, I have a knife in my pocket. I can cut their throats."</p>
<p>It was my words that made them all smile bitterly.</p>
<p>For several nights, none of us had closed our eyes, only my eight-year-old cousin and I lay on a long bench. Every day, we only heard the cracking sounds of gunfire, because the resistance of the people caused them to constantly fire machine guns. The villagers had never known this thing, and when they heard the "ku ku ku" sound, they thought it was their own death knell ringing.</p>
<p>"Buddha, please kill those dogs quickly, we can't live any longer!"</p>
<p>My mother knelt before the gods and prayed like this.</p>
<p>"I... I... I have sharpened the knife. I... I... I want to go back and kill my daughter."</p>
<p>Suddenly, a widow about forty years old, holding a shiny kitchen knife, said this while crying and walked past!</p>
<p>"Why? Are you crazy?"</p>
<p>My cousin grabbed her hand.</p>
<p>"No! I'm not crazy. My daughter doesn't want to die at the hands of barbaric bandits. I want to kill her myself."</p>
<p>"Can you bear it?"</p>
<p>"Killing her, I will also die. What can't I bear! Killing myself is always better than being killed by others!"</p>
<p>After hearing her words, my mother looked at me, then looked at my brother, and finally burst into loud sobs...</p>
<p>It was the last day of the Northern Army's retreat. My mother saw our house on fire from the top of the mountain and hurriedly ran back to us, panting:</p>
<p>"Children, stay here well and don't go out. Our house has been burned down, and I need to quickly grab some things out."</p>
<p>Saying this, she left without looking back. My brother and I desperately followed her, running halfway, bullets rained down like a storm, and my mother quickly turned around and dragged us back. After a while, we went to the front again, and she dragged us back again. Finally, in order to quickly put out the fire, she rushed forward regardless of everything! My brother followed behind her, and because I had bound feet, I couldn't run fast and slowly walked alone at the end.</p>
<p>With a thud, I fell into the field. Opening my eyes, I saw that my foot had kicked a bloody human head, the corpse placed on the left side of the road, the heart, lungs, liver, intestines, and stomach all dug out. This terrible sight, which I had never seen before, frightened me out of my wits, and I couldn't get up for a long time. Finally, my eyes looked forward at the burning house, and somehow I suddenly became bold, afraid of nothing, and just rushed forward. The road was full of corpses, and the bloody smell drilled straight into my nostrils. I felt an indescribable desolation and terror in my heart, but my two small feet still ran wildly forward.</p>
<p>Returning home, because many neighbors came to put out the fire, only two rooms were burned, and the ones that were preserved had no doors or windows. The ground was covered with feces, stinking like a toilet, and the two pigs that my mother had painstakingly raised were also killed and eaten by them. The pigskin and intestines were left stinking in the courtyard, and three corpses lay horizontally in the pool of blood in the back yard. The sky was gray and dark, and several crows flew over the eaves with a "caw," and my mother quickly knelt down and kowtowed to the sky.</p>
<p>"Buddha, please protect us, there shouldn't be any more disasters!"</p>
<p>From this time on, the ferocious, barbaric, and evil impressions of the Northern Warlords were deeply imprinted in my weak soul.</p>
<h3>"Being a Person and Writing"</h3>
<p>— Daling</p>
<p>Mr. Lin Yutang pities the "agitated" "modern young writers" because they have a "particularly bad temper," which is that they like to "curse people." According to Mr. Lin, "If you are a person who curses people everywhere, even if the writing is very beautiful, who would dare to use it? So you often end up unemployed, then complain about heaven and earth and curse society. It doesn't matter to society if this kind of person jumps into the Huangpu River... Pulling him up is a sin."</p>
<p>Then, Mr. Lin pointed out that the "problem" with this group of people is that "usually they don't even understand the ABCs of human relations." "So if I have any organization, I would dare to use a shop apprentice, but not an agitated youth." He feels that "today's hard-working shop apprentices have better manners than most college students, and are more understanding of human relations than young writers."</p>
<p>If "agitated" "young writers" can see this, they will gain a very good lesson in being a person and making a living—first, they should be understanding of human relations and learn manners, so that they won't "curse people everywhere," so that someone will like to use you, so that you won't "be unemployed."</p>
<p>But I think that simply learning "not to curse people" doesn't count as being understanding of human relations or having "manners." For example, just because you haven't cursed today's celebrities doesn't mean that the celebrities will give you food to eat. This is very clear. Even if this is because the celebrities don't know you, there are plenty of people in the world that you know and are very familiar with who won't give you food to eat because your speaking skills aren't high enough.</p>
<p>Therefore, we can see that speaking not only should not curse people, but also should not touch on reality. In case there is a need to touch on reality, don't say it directly, but say it indirectly. It is best to be able to practice "humor" in every sentence. Then, someone will like you, and someone will give you food to eat.</p>
<p>My Tao is consistent, being a person is like this, and writing should also be like this.</p>
<h3>Towards Evening (10)(5)</h3>
<p>— Qu Yi</p>
<p>"Haha!" Taking a puff of smoke and exhaling with a laugh. Hu Yiyuan stretched his neck like a heron. "It's still taking from us! The Special Tax Bureau isn't taxing the people who eat, — hey, no need to say this, I haven't gotten to the point where I have no food to eat, let you share a few more fats. I can — I want to do — I'm talking about whole numbers of one thousand, two thousand, ten thousand, twenty thousand! — um — don't touch my ticklish spot!" Saying this, he pushed away the woman sitting next to him. His hand just landed on the woman's breasts. The woman feigned a lewd "Ai!" Then: "Don't get physical!" Saying a sentence to indicate that she was such an upright woman. At the same time, she saw the woman sitting opposite making faces, pointing her finger at Hu Yiyuan, who was still smoking, as if telling her to make a more advanced move on this brigade commander.</p>
<p>"So — what about the article about the Plum Blossom Dance Troupe?" The red-bottomed white-spotted head wagged again. "Don't enjoy the rights, you always have to fulfill the obligations! Besides, using your name to publish an article on this wharf is loud, loud."</p>
<p>"Article? Oh oh! Old Guo! Old Guo!" Hu Yiyuan called out again.</p>
<p>Old Guo, who had been standing in the pit for a long time and was being ignored, was feeling a sense of buried heroism and wanted to wander out of the pit. At this time, he was suddenly stopped by Hu Yiyuan. "Old Guo, write me an article. Scold the Plum Blossom Dance Troupe, how about it? You say, you say, I, the brigade commander, have read many people, those dancers' thighs, thighs are not at all that! Moreover, moreover, they don't even entertain us reporters. I am, um, I am, um..." The cigarette holder was placed on his mouth again.</p>
<p>"But —" the new literary man turned around, "But I'm going to take a bath now. I must go take a bath. — Later, I can — can give you an essay on why dancers must wash their legs!..." Saying this, he walked towards the bathroom. No one knew how the new literary man was conceiving the essay on washing legs.</p>
<p>"But! Tonight, tonight they finally sent five admission tickets. Five —" The red-bottomed white-spotted head literary man looked at the new literary man going far away, and then safely took out a few red paper slips from his pocket again.</p>
<p>"Five! Five!" A numb, high-pitched scream. His butt was twisted again as if stung by a bee, and the red-headed literary man immediately stood up. Patting his butt and saying:</p>
<p>"Terrible terrible! There are bedbugs, there are bedbugs!"</p>
<p>"Hee hee!" The girl with "white powder and rouge in one color" who was good at making faces, laughed softly, using her eyes to indicate that she was also telling the woman opposite to do the same. But just as she blinked, the red-headed literary man's chicken-claw-like hand grabbed her bare arm.</p>

<h3>International Basketball United States Retains Championship China Suffers Second Defeat, 56 to 36</h3>
<p>This year's Shanghai International Basketball Championship only had teams from China and the United States participating. A best-of-three match system was adopted. The United States won the first match yesterday. The two countries played the second match at Zhongyuan at eight o'clock. The United States won again with a score of 56 to 36. The championship thus belongs to the United States. If China wants to win, it can only wait until next year.</p>
<p>China's Hard Fight Still Not Enough</p>
<p>One or two hundred spectators were present. The United States still sent out their strongest lineup first. After Sun Baoqing missed twice, he still opened the scoring first. The first team fought hard, and it was difficult to break the deadlock. This lasted for about three or four minutes. After four each, the situation plummeted. When the United States took a 24 to 7 lead, Qian and Feng, the two forwards, began to score. In the first half, the United States led by 28 to 14.</p>
<p>Quick Pursuit Still Fails In the second half, the United States formally retreated and rested, switching to the reserve team. Their strength was greatly reduced. The Chinese team took the opportunity to launch a fierce counterattack, recovering a lot of lost ground in succession, and quickly catching up. The difference was actually only four points. From 27 to 31 and 30 to 34, the difference was again four points. When it was 34 to 38, the United States' formal team reappeared, and the Chinese team could not avoid being embarrassed again. They eventually lost 36 to 56.</p>

The goal was 600 points, and Clark won by 184 points. Today at 5:30 PM, Chinese Ding Mingyi, ranked fourth, will compete against British Burg, and at 9:00 PM on the same afternoon, Chinese Xu Shizhang, ranked third, will compete against British Maxwell.</p>
<p>Mr. Ye Meets a Strong Opponent and Loses Badly Ye Mouzhuo is the runner-up in this year's Class B competition and has good skills, but lacks experience. He suffered from stage fright when he first met a strong opponent. He initially lost only a small amount, around 40 points. As they approached 400 points, Clark, the opponent, showed great promise. He is one of the veterans participating in the Class A competition and is experienced on the battlefield. He was able to get points from all sides. In terms of hitting the red ball alone, he scored 94 points, which was not easy. Adding another 49 points, the 600-point goal was achieved in two shots. The high scores of the two are as follows: (Clark) 25, 21, 34, 94, 49, 49, (Ye Mouzhuo) 25.</p>
<p>Xu and Ding Must Work Hard The Chinese failure in the first match was expected, but it was unexpected that Clark would have such an amazing performance, winning by a huge margin of 184 points, which could not help but give the subsequent generals a blow. In the future, the first representative Li Gongying and the second representative Zhang Yingda are likely to win against their opponents, so the outcome of the championship depends heavily on the results of the third Xu Shizhang and fourth Ding Mingyi today. If they can work harder, surpass their opponents, and reduce the number of losses, then this year's championship will still be in the hands of the Chinese team.</p>

<h3>Director of Chinese Education Chen Heqin Returned to China Yesterday Morning; Very Good Impressions Gained from Inspecting Eleven Countries; Various Educational Groups Scheduled to Hold Separate Banquets</h3>
<p>Mr. Chen Heqin, Director of the Chinese Education Department of the Shanghai Public Concession Bureau, went to England last autumn to inspect education. He returned to China on the Safort of the Blue Funnel Line on the 16th of last month and arrived in Shanghai at 9:00 a.m. yesterday. Various educational groups in Shanghai sent representatives to the port to welcome him and scheduled to hold separate banquets. The following is a record of the various situations obtained by the Shanghai News Agency reporter:</p>
<p>Returned to Shanghai Yesterday Morning. The Safort arrived at the Pudong Blue Funnel Pier at 9:00 a.m. yesterday. At 9:30, passengers were carried to the New Customs Pier by ferry. In addition to Chen's family, those who went to the port to welcome him included Chen Xuanshan, Deputy Director of the Chinese Education Department, and all senior staff, principals of various primary and secondary schools under the Public Concession Bureau, Hu Shuyi of the Children's Happiness Society, Ge Liting and Lei Zhenjing of the China Children's Education Society, Weng Guodong of the Private School Association of the Public Concession, Huang Jingwan of the China Popular Education Promotion Association, Sun Shuxing of the Commercial Press, and dozens of others.</p>
<p>Inspection Process. Chen told the Shanghai News Agency reporter on the wheel that he went abroad to England on July 29 last year. He stayed in England for a long time. In addition to inspecting the country's education administration, he also visited famous universities such as Oxford and Cambridge. After completing the inspection in England, he went to Europe to inspect France, Italy, Germany, etc., for a total of eleven countries. He observed the administration of primary and secondary schools and the facilities of new education in various places. He (Chen referred to himself) was also entrusted by the Curriculum Compilation Committee of the Ministry of Education and organizations such as the Children's Education Society and the Shanghai Branch of the Educational Film Association to conduct a supplementary inspection of the curriculum compilation in various European countries and the general situation of children's educational film education. The trip abroad lasted seven days in total. Because the vacation was over, he returned to China.</p>
<p>Situation in Various Countries. The reporter then asked about his impressions of the education situation in various countries. According to him, the goal of this trip abroad was to focus on England, so he spent the longest time in England and observed it in more detail. The situation in England is very good, and education can be universally developed. Secondly, France focuses on academic theory, while Italy is a Fascist empire, and education focuses on militarization. Its patriotic spirit is commendable, but whether it can be implemented in China cannot be imagined. As for other countries, each has its own strengths and weaknesses, and there are many places to learn from.</p>
<p>Returned to Work. Chen was granted a seven-month leave of absence by the Public Concession Bureau for his trip abroad, and Mr. Chen Xuanshan acted on his behalf in all matters. Now that the vacation is over, Chen will report to work yesterday and prepare a detailed report on the inspection process. In addition to submitting it to the Board of Directors of the Public Concession Bureau, he also plans to submit it to the Ministry of Education for reference.</p>
<p>Scheduled Banquets. Various educational groups in the city believe that Chen has gained a lot from his trip abroad to inspect education and will hold separate banquets and invite Chen to report on the inspection process. Those that have been scheduled include the Education Section of the Chinese Staff Association of the Public Concession Bureau, which will hold a banquet at the New Asia Restaurant this afternoon (7th).

<p>(1) Britain has organized a Patriotic League and launched a National Goods Purchase Week to encourage the use of national goods. In addition, they also launched "Buy National Goods Movement Week," "National Cotton Week," etc.</p>
<p>(2) Germany believes that those who love and use national goods are healthy citizens of the country and outstanding members of the country. Their admonitions are as follows:</p>
<p>1. Do not put foreign food on your table;</p>
<p>2. Use German-made paper, write with German-made pens and ink, and use German blotting paper;</p>
<p>3. Only German flour, fruit, and beer truly give us Germans energy;</p>
<p>4. If you don't like drinking German coffee, you can drink coffee from German colonies;</p>
<p>5. You should wear German cloth and wear a German hat.</p>
<p>(3) France requires foreign goods, such as canned foods, to clearly indicate the original country of origin and requires domestic wheat to be used for bread ingredients.</p>
<p>(4) Belgium, in order to support the price of the franc - the name of the French currency - has set up a "Belgian Franc Day." The promotional slogans of the Franc Support League have a few words saying: "Your motherland is Belgium, you must live and die with your motherland, you must be frugal, love and use national goods, and do not waste."</p>
<p>(5) Denmark sets up "Denmark Day" every week, vigorously promoting and using national goods, and posting many national goods trademarks in public places or on main roads to show the difference.</p>
<p>(6) Norway encourages the use of national goods and does not allow the posting of foreign goods advertisements in public places.</p>
<h3>The Forced Auction of Shenxin No. 7 Factory and the Future of National Goods</h3>
<p>— Xuan Wan</p>
<p>Recently - on February 27th, we all read in the newspaper that another unprecedented and painful page was discovered in the history of national goods industry! The fact is that seven years ago, Shenxin Yarn Factory mortgaged 2 million yuan to the British HSBC Bank due to economic reasons. Now, because it cannot be repaid upon maturity, the bank auctioned it off at the Loui Shi Moyer &amp; Co. on the 26th. As a result, it was purchased by a Japanese person for 2.25 million yuan, and the transaction was formally concluded. Our side is now actively negotiating.</p>
<p>From the revelation of this fact, we naturally understand more deeply that the future of Chinese industry under the economic aggression of imperialism is already so dangerous. This so-called last remaining fruit - the textile industry, the "king" of light industry, representing the Shenxin Factory of China's national industry, has now reached such a point. Under the invasion of foreign storms, it has gone from "stopping work" and "reducing work" to the stage of complete bankruptcy. The result of the international capitalist market monopoly, dumping and exploitation, can also be more concretely demonstrated, the hideous face and vicious means, how to destroy the attitude of our country's industry, we can see more clearly in the development of this situation, and "learn from the pain," at this time, at least it can give us the following two most painful stimuli.</p>
<p>First, Chinese industry is being constrained everywhere, and the backing of imperialist economic aggression is precisely a strong political force. Foreign factories in China can enjoy various preferential treatments, from dumping to the exclusive possession of the entire market, and then to manipulating the national supply and demand. The slight power of the domestic industry itself is naturally far from being an opponent; it is being crushed and declared bankrupt.</p>
<p>Second, imperialism has completely unveiled its usual mask at this time, which has made us feel the flavor of the result of dumping. From here, we can also strengthen the belief of the people across the country to work hard on their own, and know that the revival of the national economy can never be hoped for by relying on the power of foreign capital. We must break free from the shackles of foreigners, work hard to build our own garden, and move towards the future of genuine Chinese industrial production.</p>
<p>In short, this HSBC auction of the Shenxin incident should not be regarded as the success or failure of Shenxin Factory alone. The key to it is the future of the entire national goods industry. The serious lesson tells us that we must thoroughly understand it. From now on, the financial sector and our production sector must coordinate the national economic structure, and no longer give foreigners the opportunity to manipulate the national industry. We should provide a large amount of funds to assist us. Our industrial sector should also work harder to improve technology, reduce costs, and compete with foreign goods. And the government should especially use the greatest strength to protect and support it. The people of the whole country should unite as a backing. In this way, today's failure may be a sign of future industrial revival.</p>
<p>As for how the various national goods groups are currently planning to rescue Shenxin No. 7 Factory and fight with HSBC, this still involves judicial issues and diplomatic issues, which I will not be able to elaborate on in this short article.</p>
<h3>Ms. Ding Yusan Invented the Automatic Knitting Machine</h3>
<p>— Linghu Zhao</p>
<p>Ms. Ding Yusan was born in Deng County. She was very clever as a child, and graduated from the Provincial Women's Normal School when she grew up. She liked to study various physics and chemistry subjects the most.</p>
<p>In 1928, Ms. Ding invented the handmade manufacture of straw hats and founded a knitting factory. In the summer of last year, she invented the ingenious automatic knitting machine. This kind of knitting machine has a simple structure, but it can weave various woolen yarn and cotton yarn clothing, vests, scarves, children's hats, etc.; it is dozens of times faster than the old method of knitting with knitting needles.</p>
<p>That kind of machine is extremely lightweight and can be used anytime, anywhere. The products are also very uniform and beautiful, and the patterns and colors can be changed at will. The Ministry of Industry believes that the inventor, Ms. Ding Yusan, has a unique ingenuity in creating machines, which is of great benefit to the civilian occupation, in addition to specially ordering rewards, and issuing a patent certificate, allowing a five-year patent.</p>
<p>Recently, in order to popularize civilian crafts and promote production, Ms. Ding first established the Automatic Knitting Machine Weaving Craft Training Institute in Bian, providing free training. It is said that those who sign up to study are very enthusiastic.</p>
<h3>A Record of Visiting a Metal Factory</h3>
<p>— Zhang Mengzhao</p>
<p>At this critical moment when foreign goods are rampant and silver is flowing out, it is everyone's responsibility to purchase and use national goods. Special attention and understanding should be given to national goods manufacturing factories. The day before yesterday, during my holiday, Mr. Du Yichen and I drove to Jiadeli, Hujiamuqiao, Hongkou, to visit the Liyong Metal Factory. Mr. Yang Zhiyi came out to receive us and led us to visit the factory. We saw machine tool beds and other equipment arranged neatly, and more than 40 employees, all of whom had received considerable education, were immersed in their work. Manager and engineer Shen Hong, a native of Haining, Zhejiang, is rich in mechanical knowledge and manufacturing experience, and supervises the employees tirelessly. Mr. Yang told me that "the factory's products include dozens of types of door locks, desk locks, safe locks, steel window locks, silver box locks, and dog tag door locks. It can also design and customize for customers. The only purpose is to promote sales at low profits and awaken the people to use national goods. The customers who use it include the Shanghai Post Office, Shanghai Steel Window Company, and Zhejiang Industrial Bank. The distributors include China National Goods Company, Shanghai National Goods Company, Wing On, Sincere, and other companies. The founders are Hu Lianqing, Yang Jingqing, Shen Hong, Zhang Runda, and Yang Zhiyi. The shareholders also serve as salespersons, and there are no expenses to increase the burden on the factory." I deeply feel that Mr. Yang's words can be used as an example for other factories. What is especially commendable is that the necessary tools for manufacturing are made by Engineer Shen and the workers themselves. We were very satisfied with the visit, so I wrote this article to tell the people of the country.</p>
<h3>National Goods Exhibition in Changshu</h3>
<p>— Yihong</p>
<p>Under the surging tide of the national goods movement across the country, Changshu, confined to the inland, actually has calls for visiting the national goods exhibition, which are excitedly shouted out by the general public. It turns out that the mobile national goods exhibition jointly organized by various manufacturers in Shanghai has opened for the second time. This time, there are 22 manufacturers participating, including Wuzhou Soap Factory, Yaguang Electric Wood Jade Factory, Xuechi Parasol Factory, Yonggu Paint Factory, First Toothbrush Factory, Yongfeng Battery Factory, Yun Fuxiang Silk Scarf Factory, Wansheng Food Company, and Yili Glassware Factory. Although the scope of national goods is very wide, you can get a glimpse of it.</p>
<p>The location of this exhibition is in Huiri Temple in the city center of Changshu City. On the one hand, it is due to the suitable location, and on the other hand, due to the curiosity of people, so on the opening day, those who visited and purchased were very crowded. Although no grand ceremony was held, an atmosphere of national goods movement was invisibly created in the city center area in front of the temple. From this, it can be seen that our usual empty propaganda is not as easy to attract people's attention as a practical demonstration. The Women's National Goods Year and the Student's National Goods Year have seized the giant wheel of the times, so among the people who visit, especially women and students are the most; although the types of national goods they purchase have different purposes, the spirit of protecting the national goods industry is equally enthusiastic.</p>
<p>Among these 22 manufacturers, Yaguang Electric Wood Jade, Zhang Xiaoquan Scissors, and China Celluloid products have particularly aroused the interest of viewers. The other companies also gave the people of Changshu many good impressions. I hope that not only will Shanghai's national goods manufacturers often come to the inland to exhibit, but also the local specialties of various places will be visited and studied by each other. Then, the future of this kind of mobile exhibition is truly limitless!</p>
<p>At a time when silver is exported and the whole country is panicked, if we open the customs import and export statistics, we will know that the huge amount of import surplus in previous years has already destined the fate of silver outflow. Last year, the overseas silver price soared, which was profitable, but it was just transferred from the vaults of foreign banks to foreign countries. The fundamental way to stop the outflow of silver is to reduce the import surplus. If we want to reduce the import surplus, we can only make everyone determined to use national goods, promote national goods, and promote national goods. The national goods exhibition shoulders this important mission!</p>
<h3>Small Statistics</h3>
<p>— Yan Xinquan</p>
<p>Stationery and Envelopes</p>
<p>In one hundred letters from friends, I have statistically analyzed whether the stationery and envelopes used are national goods or non-national goods. The results are as follows:</p>
<p>Stationery and envelopes are all national goods, accounting for 21%. Completely non-national goods account for 32%. Envelopes are national goods, stationery is non-national goods, accounting for 11%. Envelopes are non-national goods, stationery is national goods, accounting for 28%. Others that are unclear account for 8%.</p>

<h3>Finance: Speculation Gold Rises Again; Exchange Market Extraordinarily Tight; News Favors Buying; Highest Almost Nearing 900 Yuan Mark; Continues to Jump Madly by 23 Yuan</h3>
<p>Since the counter-offensive rebound in the gold market the day before yesterday, the market yesterday showed an alarming rising trend, almost approaching the 900 yuan mark, because national goods banks and others frantically grabbed foreign exchange, and there was a rumor that Sassoon was secretly covering shorts, which led to the exchange market being extraordinarily tight again and again, stimulating buying, and a sharp rebound. Several major levels were broken one after another, and rumors fueled the buying mood. Ordinary retail investors who had turned from long to short had already suffered heavy losses. Unexpectedly, the panic had just subsided, and there was a sharp rise. The strength of retail shorts was extremely weak. At this point, they could not withstand the destruction and were forced to cover urgently. The trading floor was dry, and the rising trend was even more intense. It was found that at the beginning of the morning, the overseas silver market in the UK and the US both shrank, but not much. The long position was established, and after the market closed, it rebounded higher. The forward silver price in Menderi fell by 6.5 to 1.12 points. The exchange rate opened higher and shrank.

After the opening, the selling mood did not subside, and it once fell to the 50 yuan mark, but because the banks seized the cheap to grab, it rose immediately after falling. HSBC's official exchange rates were still afraid and still struggling. When the national goods banks began to grab foreign exchange sharply, and there was also a rumor that Sassoon was secretly covering shorts, the exchange market suddenly tightened after that. HSBC's official exchange rates were revised again, and two major levels of 67 and 70 yuan were broken. Foreign banks were still blocking, and there were more orders after the high. However, the national goods banks continued to pour in foreign exchange, and the people's hearts were even more cheerful. There were also many rumors on the trading floor because of this, and another level of 90 yuan was broken. An Associated Press report stated that after inquiring the British and American ambassadors, they denied any borrowing. HSBC's official exchange rates were revised again, and the market conditions were extremely chaotic and irregular after that, rising sharply to 897.5 yuan. Sassoon seized the opportunity to throw repeatedly, which first made the exchange market stiff, and the sellers began to move. The falling trend followed, and another two levels of 90 and 80 were broken, falling back by 20 yuan. The noon closing was still flat. At present, the chips have increased to more than 19,000, with 44 long positions and 56 short positions. Now, the details of the half-day market conditions are recorded below.</p>

Afterwards, national goods banks and others aggressively covered their short positions in foreign exchange. There was also talk of Sassoon quietly covering its short positions. Confidence improved.

Sassoon aggressively sold shillings at high prices. HSBC China also sold, while Banque de l'Indochine bought.</p>
<h3>Call Loan Market Still Chaotic</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market lacked news and trading was sparse. Call loan rates remained unchanged. The morning and afternoon rates were both at 9%. Headings were unmarked, with no added water. Call loan transactions occurred because no one was willing to lend, resulting in a calm situation. Therefore, the number of transactions was limited, but better than the previous day. The amount of transfers totaled over 3.1 million, new transactions over 300,000, afternoon transactions over 200,000, transactions at the Small General Association over 400,000, customer sources 200,000, withdrawals 50,000.

<h3>Kiangsi Small Silver Shows Strength in Early Market</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the local small silver of Kiangsi, early in the morning a bit of buying appetite, so the price rose, calculated to be 837.5 yuan, better than the previous day by 1.5 yuan, the afternoon market the same price, but the situation is difficult to stand for long, fearing that it will still have to fall soon, making transactions, 5,000 in the early market, no transactions in the afternoon, Guangdong small silver, the early market was 733.2 yuan, lower than the previous day by 0.7 yuan, the afternoon market price was also the same, making transactions of 180,000 in the early market, 70,000 in the afternoon, copper coins still no up or down, calculated as 331,000 cash, making transactions of 46,340 strings, equivalent to 14,000 yuan in foreign currency.</p>
<h3>Securities Loan Problem Shakes Bond Market</h3>
<p>Yesterday at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange, the market showed signs of extreme volatility. Initially, it weakened due to long positions liquidating, then rallied sharply due to short covering, and finally fell sharply due to unfavorable news. Market prices changed three times in one day, completely affected by the unpredictable environmental atmosphere. International loans were initially reported to be increasingly close, but later evening newspapers reported that Japan opposed and hindered them. Market prices rose and fell wildly accordingly. The market, which had a slight spring air, was greatly hit as a result. Moving forward, the loan issue still has many twists and turns, and I am afraid that there will be several more fluctuations. Yesterday, after the opening in the morning, various gangs sold sporadically and fell slightly by 0.3 to 0.4 yuan. In the next session, No. 4 and No. 16 and others had extremely strong buying appetite, and the situation on the table was extremely tense. The salt tax rose sharply by 0.95 yuan. After the opening in the afternoon, it was slightly dazed, and transactions were extremely strong. Most of the various types continued to be good by 0.3 to 0.4 yuan, while the salt tax alone was slightly lower by 0.2 to 0.3 yuan. The long position front line showed signs of shaking. Suddenly, at the close, news spread that Japan opposed international loans. Although the northern gangs deliberately pulled up and compiled and omitted information to confuse the line of sight, in the end, the short side was enthusiastic and fell from weakness. After entering, it fell more and more fiercely, and the short gold suddenly fell by as much as 0.85 yuan. As a result, the market price was slightly higher by 0.1 to 0.2 yuan in the front row, while compilation and demobilization rose by 0.6 to 0.7 yuan alone. In the back row, from the 20th roll onwards, all were lower by 0.2 to 0.3 yuan, and 96 was still good by 0.3 to 0.4 yuan. The total number of transactions was approximately 30 million yuan.</p>
<h3>US Dollar Continues to Strengthen, New York Stock Market Continues to Fall</h3>
<p>Sin Fung Foreign Firm reports that yesterday (May 5), the New York stock market, led by railway, automobile, and steel stocks, fell by $1 to $4. Railroad freight traffic increased significantly. At the same time, steel purchases from various sectors, except the automobile industry, were better than generally expected. However, according to "American Hardware Market," the steel purchased by the automobile industry was not as large as generally stated. The US dollar continued to strengthen. Mining stocks also fell due to the decrease in New York silver prices. The decrease in New York silver prices was due to the smaller London open market discount rate, due to sales from China and low gold prices. The bond market fell slightly. US government bonds rose. Small exchange stocks fell sharply. Wheat fell due to uncertain currencies and lack of interest. The total daily turnover was 900,000 shares. The Dow Jones New York index is listed below:</p>
<p>4th     5th     Compared to previous day</p>
<p>Thirty Industrials  102.58   100.09   Down 2.49</p>
<p>Twenty Railroads   30.52    29.24    Down 1.28</p>
<p>Twenty Utilities   15.79    15.35    Down 0.44</p>
<p>Forty Bonds    96.52    96.26    Down 0.26</p>
<p>Eleven Commodities  58.70    57.95    Down 0.75</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton – Marked Yarn and Cotton Continue to Rise</h3>
<p>The yarn market continues to rise, and the situation is gradually stabilizing. Because the exchange rate has stabilized and the rise in gold prices is unstoppable, short positions are being covered, and the market is rising. At the same time, spot yarn sales are becoming more and more developed. Henan Province is continuously purchasing 17-count yarn. Sichuan merchants have healthy sales due to the cheap exchange rate. Therefore, confidence is becoming more and more consolidated.</p>
<p>Far-Month Yarn Also Up 0.7-0.8 Yuan</p>
<p>In the pre-market for marked yarn, prices for all months showed a slight increase. However, there were few new buyers in the market. At the 3:00 PM close, it was heard that the gold market was soaring, and floating traders covered their positions slightly, rising 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, and 0.6 yuan, but the current month fell by 0.1 yuan. After the opening in the afternoon, the market conditions continued to be good, and spot yarn sales were exciting, with more than 3,000 bales sold, but the prices did not move. However, the market was unable to rise significantly because there was a lack of new buyers, and there were very few transactions. This is because after the organization of multiple large companies, the general retail investors are cautious about selling. Therefore, although there is good news, there is no short covering, so the yarn market's reaction is not as strong as the cotton market's. As a result, prices for all months rose again by 0.1, 0.2, and 0.4 yuan. It was found that 750 bales of Dafu, 600 bales of Suilong, 750 bales of Renfeng, 600 bales of Taichang, 950 bales of Runkang, 600 bales of Shenji, 500 bales of Yichang, and 1,150 bales of Changfeng were sold. 850 bales of Tongji, 600 bales of Yukang, 1,050 bales of Dafeng, 500 bales of Tongfeng, 550 bales of Shenji, 1,000 bales of Changfeng, and 1,500 bales of Yuanyi were bought. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day are as follows:</p>
<p>Yarn Sales Exceed 3,000 Bales</p>
<p>The spot yarn sales market is unusually active. It is reported that all gangs bought a total of 3,315 bales throughout the day. Prices were similar to the previous day. The purchase amounts for each gang are as follows:</p>
<p>Sichuan 710, Yunnan 280, Inland 565, Wuhu 25, Henan 1370, Xuzhou 15, Guangdong 260, Fujian 5, Jiangxi 5, Trade 30, Shantou 1.</p>
<p>The cotton market soared with gold prices. Although the US and Indian cotton markets were weak, the exchange rate shrank significantly, changing several levels in one day, causing confidence to rise. The Ningbo gang suddenly came with a large number of covers, about 30,000 piculs, and the rising atmosphere in the market became more intense. However, foreign merchants still did not take action. Cotton market insiders said that the cotton market still has a few cents of upward potential.</p>
<p>Zheng Marked Cotton Continues to Rise 0.3-0.4 Yuan</p>
<p>In the pre-market for marked cotton, English cotton was flat, and Indian cotton trended downward. However, the US silver price for forward contracts shrank by more than 100 British pounds, and gold prices soared, so there were few sellers in the market, and the market price had a hidden rising wind. At the second session, it fell again. Later, it was heard that gold prices broke through 890 yuan, and the rising trend was very strong. The Ningbo gang covered their shorts in large quantities, and the closing situation was more expensive. As a result, prices for all months rose by 0.15 to 0.25 yuan. After the opening in the afternoon, the market situation was still strong. Ningbo still came to cover their shorts, but Yuanda took the opportunity to release stock during the rise, and the market atmosphere was flattened. However, it was still good at the close. As a result, prices for all months rose again by 0.05 to 0.15 yuan. It was reported that 11,900 piculs of Yuanda, 2,600 piculs of Taixing, 3,700 piculs of Renfeng, 3,600 piculs of Yichang, 2,200 piculs of Dachang, 3,400 piculs of Shengyuan, 4,000 piculs of Yikang, 1,700 piculs of Xinting, 1,800 piculs of Jifeng, and 1,800 piculs of Senkang were sold. 9,100 piculs of Gengfeng, 6,400 piculs of Changfeng, 7,000 piculs of Yuanxingchang, 19,900 piculs of Changhe, 1,800 piculs of Yuda, and 1,500 piculs of Junchang were bought. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day are as follows:</p>
<p>Factory Demand Active Again</p>
<p>Spot cotton consumption, due to the shrinking exchange rate and the rising of cotton futures, factory demand has become active again.</p>
<p>Yunbao Cotton  48.50  Shanghai Factory Intake 164 pieces Spot Delivery to Factory</p>
<p>Also  48.30  Shenxin Factory Intake 200 pieces Also Also</p>
<p>Tianjin American  47.50  Also  300 pieces Also Also</p>
<p>Shashi Cotton  43.20  Dafeng Factory Intake 150 pieces Also Also</p>
<p>Also  43.20  Yufeng Factory Intake 100 pieces Also Also</p>
<p>Lingbao Cotton  49.00  Shenxin Factory Intake 164 pieces Also Also</p>
<h3>Uncertain Exchange Rate, Decline in US Cotton Not Abating, English and Indian Cotton Also Weakening</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the US cotton market opened steadily. Near-month contracts were quite strong due to limit-priced purchases by traders, but were offset by the soft situation in Liverpool. The mainland and the Far East were buying, while Liverpool was selling. Local traders and New Orleans brokers were also selling. In addition, small declines in grains and stocks caused Wall Street to sell. Speculators, due to the uncertainty of foreign exchange rates and cotton industry legislation, did not know what to do. The future of the textile industry is bleak, and spinning mills are considering reducing production. The close was flat, with spot prices unchanged, the current month rising by 2 points, and the remaining months falling by 1 to 5 points. English cotton weakened due to the rise in the gold pound, with spot prices falling by 4 points and futures falling by 5 points. Indian cotton was slightly weaker due to retail short selling, with Pingguoer falling by 1.25 rupees, Oulaom unchanged, and Bailuoxi falling by 1 rupee. Original telegrams are listed on the left (May 5 telegram):</p>
<p>Pingguoer 142.25 Down 1.25 19.40</p>
<p>Oulaom 123.00 Flat  29.40</p>
<p>Bailuoxi 146.50 Down 1.00 32.80</p>
<p>According to a Mumbai telegram, the opening forecast for Bailuoxi cotton on the 7th was 247 rupees, down half a rupee from the previous day's close.</p>
<h3>Grains and Flour Follow Gold Price Increase</h3>
<p>After the opening of the flour market in the morning, prices for all months showed a consistent and sharp increase. As for foreign wheat quotations, Chicago was down by about 0.2 to 0.3 yuan, and Canada was down by 0.04 to 0.1 yuan. After the opening, with the improvement in international exchange rates, prices rose sharply step by step. Therefore, people inside and outside the industry saw good conditions. Moreover, because current flour is unusually tight this month, not only must No. 2 flour be scheduled for loading, but also No. 3 and 4 flours are not currently available. Half of the market's rebound is also related to current flour conditions. When the afternoon market opened, it was initially stable, but later, due to a large number of floating shorts, and in view of the tightness of current flour, panic inevitably arose, and coverage began. The market atmosphere then rose step by step. The previous decline was purely driven by gold prices, and now that the situation has changed, recovery is naturally very easy. As a result, the current month rose by 0.0275 yuan, April rose by 0.0325 yuan, May rose by 0.025 yuan, and June, July, and August each rose by 0.0375 yuan.</p>
<p>After the opening of the wheat market in the morning and afternoon, prices for all months showed a stable state. As for foreign wheat quotations, Chicago was down by about 0.2 to 0.3 yuan, and Canada was down by about 0.04 to 0.1 yuan. When the morning market opened, the market atmosphere was stable, so the fluctuations were very small. When the afternoon market opened, because the flour market rebounded sharply, and with the rise in gold prices, confidence also turned for the better. However, there were very few outside buyers, and factories all ordered huge amounts of foreign wheat, so although the trend was good, the increase was not significant. As a result, March was up by 0.03 yuan, April was up by 0.06 yuan, and July was up by 0.04 yuan. Current wheat conditions had been suspended for many days. Yesterday, because the negotiations between both parties were close, trading finally resumed. It was reported that 4,000 bags of Shandong Guide wheat at 3.77 yuan, Bengbu wheat at 3.75 yuan, and Jiangbei Liuhe wheat at 3.72 and 3.77 yuan were bought by Shen Da and Xin Da.</p>
<p>Chicago Wheat 4th 5th Fluctuations</p>
<p>May 97.00 95.875 Down 1.25</p>
<p>July 91.25 90.50 Down 0.875</p>
<p>September 90.625 89.875 Down 0.75</p>
<p>Spot 105.25 No Market</p>
<p>Canadian Wheat 4th 5th Fluctuations</p>
<p>May 83.875 83.50 Down 0.375</p>
<p>July 83.50 83.375 Down 0.125</p>
<p>Spot 81.25 81.00 Up 0.25</p>
<h3>Yangtze Gang Buys Over 10,000 Bags of Foreign Rice – Price Up 0.1-0.05 Yuan –</h3>
<p>Yesterday, foreign rice demand was very strong, especially among the Yangtze gangs, because the flat prices in the Yangtze ports of origin have soared, and Shanghai prices have fallen, resulting in reverse remittances. Yesterday, the Jiujiang gang was the most active, buying nearly 10,000 bags of Saigon rice. The Hankou gang also finalized 3,000-4,000 bags. Nanjing and other inland ports were especially keen to buy, while local merchants retreated. A total of 25,000 bags of Saigon and Siam rice were sold, half of which were small-grain varieties. Round-grain Saigon rice rose by nearly 0.1 yuan, and other major varieties rose by 0.05 yuan. There have been no new arrivals of customer rice for a long time, and inventories are also low. Yesterday, inland merchants bought over 1,000 bags of machine-husked red rice, and prices also rose by 0.05-0.06 yuan.</p>
<h3>Rice Market Arrivals Scarce, Slightly Stabilizing</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, over ten new sources of supply arrived (totaling nearly 3,000 piculs). Local sales were still sluggish, and only the Tianjin and Yantai gangs and others bought 500-600 bags. However, the market has seen limited arrivals for several days, and confidence has stabilized slightly, so the prices of various high-grade japonica and early rice have mostly stabilized, with no significant ups or downs. Only mid-grade rice, due to lack of inquiries, has been weak, with variable rates and flat price weakness. Du Jian remained unchanged.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, fifteen or sixteen ships arrived from the lower reaches of the river. The destination for various goods was flat in the early market, and prices were still slightly lower by a few cents. The afternoon market saw slight inquiries, leading to price stabilization. With fewer arrivals of thin-grain rice, other goods were still acceptable, and the price situation was fixed. There were still soft prices for various goods.</p>
<h3>Sesame Short Covering Sees Improvement – Soybean Transactions Not Weak –</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the soybean market, taking advantage of the good market atmosphere of the previous day, saw increased buying interest. It was reported that factories bought nine truckloads of Haozhou sesame, with prices ranging from 3.56 to 3.53 yuan. Factories and the Tongzhou gang jointly bought over 1,000 bags of Guide sesame, with prices reaching 3.75 yuan. They also jointly took five truckloads of Bengbu sesame, with prices ranging from 3.47 to 3.43 yuan. The Hankou Zazhi sesame was purchased by local, inland, and Tongzhou gangs for over 2,000 bags, with prices ranging from 3.49 to 3.38 yuan. Prices tightened due to sellers holding back their goods. The market situation is temporarily less certain due to various factors. Foreign sesame has been quiet for a long time. The day before yesterday, 200 tons were transacted at a price of 8.75 yuan. Yesterday, amateur brokers and foreign firms bought 200 tons to cover their shorts, with the price reaching 9 yuan.</p>
<h3>Metals: Arrivals of Pig Lead Strong, Sales Stagnant</h3>
<p>Pig lead transactions have been unusually stagnant recently. The customer gangs have not shown any interest, and factory transactions are also very rare. Therefore, the market's quietness can almost be described as extreme. However, arrivals have been very numerous, and the amount in storage is sufficient to supply the market for three or four months with ease. As a result, the standard price has been unusually weak, currently at 14.12 yuan, while fire ticket transactions can be as low as 14 yuan. It is said that only two to three hundred bars have been sold in recent days. Overseas pricing has also been very weak recently, estimated at USD 52 per ton, down USD 2 from the previous telegram. Therefore, the local market will not easily recover for a while.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Guangdong Raw White Sugar Soars by 0.6 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market's trend rose sharply due to Customs Gold soaring to a high of 1850, closing at 1805. The Sugar Industry Cooperative Company auctioned 3,365 bags of Guangdong raw white sugar for 16.9 yuan. As a result, buyers were enthusiastic, and demand exceeded supply, and it was only possible to allocate the sugar proportionally at a rate of 68%, and the full amount was shipped. Among them, those who re-exported received a refund of 0.45 yuan, a sudden increase of 0.6 yuan compared to the previous (4th) day. Also, 150 bags of 24 Dutch raw white sugar for re-export were sold at 4.9 yuan, an increase of 0.15 yuan. Taikoo B mark was 17.9 yuan, an increase of 0.25 yuan. Our factory's cotton, Zenyu No. 1, was 16.7 yuan, No. 2 was 0.6 yuan, No. 3 was 0.45 yuan, and No. 4 was 0.3 yuan, rebounding from the lowest point by 0.7 yuan. Chaoqing had about 500 bags available in the past two days, and prices were also firm, with Tiqing at 10.4 yuan, followed by 10.12 yuan to 9.2 yuan.</p>
<h3>Dried and Preserved Goods: Shantou Tangerine Cakes Suddenly Fall by 2 Yuan</h3>
<p>Shantou tangerine cakes had previously reached 27-28 yuan. Recently, because it is the peak season for new production and the water level is still high, the cost of shipping is lower. Yesterday, it was heard that the number of arrivals from various shops had increased significantly, and they were available for sale at 25 yuan, a huge drop of 2 yuan compared to before. If there is no surge in later arrivals, it may be temporarily stable.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Gongxi Green Tea Sees Some Sales</h3>
<p>Recently, the foreign tea market has been unusually quiet due to the rising silver prices and expensive exchange rates abroad. The Jinlong Xiehe and other foreign firms had previously sent out many telegrams due to Chinese merchants offering price concessions for Zhenmei and Zhucha teas, but there was no news. However, Ruichang and Honglong, among others, bought over 370 packages of Luzhuang Gongxi green tea yesterday, with the market selling at 22-23 yuan, 3-4 yuan lower than the sales in the previous month. The losses suffered by merchants were quite large.</p>

<p>Essays</p>
<h3>Tidbits</h3>
<p>— (Jin Xiongyu)</p>
<p>A friend's old uncle died. Extending wealth and forcing recommendations made the event very lively amidst the sorrow. However, I only saw a pair of lifetime imprisonment judgments; the law damaged a small monk of about ten years old; inside a man of not yet thirty years of age who came to mourn the deceased. (Cheng Zhenru)</p>
<p>We people toil in this world, without expressing ourselves, just like eating sesame cakes; the older we get, the more we bite at the edge of the cake: approaching old age and death is like eating the center. By the time we bid farewell to the world, the cake has been eaten: only countless sesame seeds remain, waiting for future generations to count and tidy up one by one.</p>
<p>Therefore, the world loses one sesame cake, and I will never be seen again in this world: over time, even my surname and residence will disappear, isn't that very good? I have always said that it is best for us to leave no trace in our lives. Those with brilliant achievements and lasting fame throughout the ages simply do not want to understand this meaning.</p>
<h3>Self-Awareness and Self-Destruction</h3>
<p>— Xuan</p>
<p>Self-awareness is the mother of progress, self-destruction is the source of decline. Therefore, self-awareness is indispensable, and self-destruction should not exist. For example, in yesterday's letter from my friend, he mentioned that Mr. ×, because of the problem of unemployment, even refused to eat, and reportedly wanted to be a starving ghost. Do you think that this kind of self-destructive mentality is something our young people should have? Let's try to analyze this mentality. It is actually looking down on oneself, unwilling to be a promising young person. If we conduct further psychological analysis, we will know that this is a self-destructive mentality that arises after self-awareness. It is a pity that a promising young person has this kind of self-destructive mentality. If this self-destructive mentality latent in the minds of young people is not completely eradicated, then the future of our young people is really bleak, and everyone will run down the path of decline.</p>
<p>In short, self-awareness means being aware of one's strengths and striving to preserve and further develop them, and being aware of one's shortcomings and striving to avoid and work hard to overcome them. Self-awareness is the mother of progress because of this. If one is aware of one's shortcomings and harbors a self-destructive mentality, it means willingly living in a lowly position forever. The result is decadence, not progress.</p>
<p>In this chaotic era in our country, there are naturally many unsatisfactory aspects. The direction we should strive for is to rely on ourselves, using collective wisdom and efforts to turn the unsatisfactory aspects into satisfactory ones. Otherwise, no matter how unwilling you are to do it, it will never be satisfactory. Thinking through this point, after self-awareness, we only need to strive forward, not self-destruct. We should be upright and open-minded, doing things with peace of mind, and doing our best to be a progressive young person.</p>
<h3>Record of Strange Surnames</h3>
<p>— Wan</p>
<p>Besides a primer reader called "Hundred Family Surnames", I have not seen any special books on the study of surnames in China. So I do not know how many surnames there are in China. As far as I know, there are many surnames not recorded in "Hundred Family Surnames", but which are often encountered now - and many surnames are very strange! Let me write a few out to see!</p>
<p>The owner of Shanghai Guanshengyuan is Xi Guansheng. (冼) is different from 洗. There are already very few people with the surname Xi, but he has one less stroke than the character 洗. On Henan Road in Shanghai, there is a medicine shop called Xi Zhongfu Tang, and its owner has the surname 洗. (蹇) In the Spring and Autumn Period, the Jin state had Jian Shu. Now in the Shanghai literary scene, there is a Han Xian'ai, I wonder if he is a descendant of Jian Shu? (戢) Ji Yiqiao, a member of the Beiping Military Sub-Committee (策) There is a Ce Jue Lin, and he is often seen in the newspapers now. (門) Men Zhizhong, the division commander of the Henan Army. (井) Jing Yuexiu, is also a division commander of the Henan Army. (况) Zhu Chuanyi, a member of the Xikang Provincial Construction Committee. (尋) Xun Weizhou, the commander of the pseudo-nineteenth division who was captured in Jiangxi. (寸) Cun Lianjie, the brigade commander of the 12th Division of the Third Army, he is from Yunnan. (明) Ming Shaowu, the chief of the Medical Department of the Third Army. (戎) Rong Boming, a famous amateur actor at sea, probably many people know him. (閃) I used to know a person with the surname Shan, whose ancestor was called Shan Diankui, who served as the governor of Sichuan. (偶) In the educational circles of Hefei, there is an Ou Shijun. (兀) pronounced Qi, there are people with this surname in Huaining. The above surnames are all extremely unpopular - and there are also (古) Ying Fen, (居) Zheng, (經) Hengyi, (香) Hanping, (冷) Yu, (辜) Hongming, (區) Fangpu. These celebrities’ surnames are also rarely seen, but because they are too famous, they have become common.</p>
<h3>Doors Unlocked at Night</h3>
<p>— Jiang Mi</p>
<h3>Little Western Paradise</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>His completely pleading way of speaking softened Zhang Jiefu's conscience considerably. Besides sympathizing with him, how could he say those oppressive words? He paused, smiled slightly, and found himself unable to continue. Yueying said, "Master Zhang, why have you stopped speaking? Am I saying something wrong?" Zhang Jiefu laughed and said, "You are saying pitiful things, what could be wrong? However, I am speaking on behalf of someone else. If I say something wrong, don't blame me. Hehe!" Saying this, he laughed twice more before saying to Madam Hu, "Mr. Jia's intention is that if you are willing to give him your daughter, the sooner the better." Madam Hu said, "Is that all? That's easy to say. As long as Master Jia gives us three an explanation, he can pick any day he likes, and we will send the girl over." Zhang Jiefu nodded and said, "That's naturally what you mean, but he doesn't see the matter as so grand. What he means is, it would be best if you left the girl here tonight, and you could take the silver dollars on the table with you." Madam Hu exclaimed, "What are you saying? Marriage is a serious matter, how can it be so casual?" Yueying, upon hearing this, felt her heart pounding wildly, her face as if smeared with spirits, burning red all the way to the back of her ears, and she lowered her head, her chin pressed tightly against her chest. Zhang Jiefu had brought the matter to this point, and if he didn't mention love, it would cause even more misunderstanding between the two. Moreover, the two of them seemed only to find it strange, not particularly resistant. (150)</p>
<h3>Fragrant Imperial Records</h3>
<p>— Original work by Princess Der Ling of the Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>The news of the Empress Dowager's return had already spread to Beijing. Therefore, before our train even passed Fengtai, a large number of officials were already waiting at the station. From imperial relatives and nobles to palace maids and eunuchs remaining in the palace, anyone who had any connection and could squeeze in had come to welcome the Empress Dowager. Even those stubborn ministers who had desperately submitted memorials to prevent her from going to Fengtian by train when she departed were now rushing to come. In their hearts, they couldn't help but feel somewhat surprised that the Empress Dowager and our group could return to Beijing safely. Perhaps they regarded it as a miracle brought about by the Empress Dowager's great fortune, something beyond normal reason. There was no time to delve into it. The Empress Dowager showed no excitement at seeing so many people sincerely welcoming her, merely glancing at them briefly and considering it done. She had grown accustomed to this kind of flamboyant display of power over the past forty years, and therefore no longer felt anything special about it. If her character hadn't been one of enjoying sole control of power and looking down upon the world, she would surely have grown tired of this kind of vain and bustling display long ago! I often wondered privately, if there were an unexpected opportunity that could free her from all constraints and allow her to start anew as a different person, would she be willing to change all the behaviors she had become accustomed to? This is something worth studying. Now, although her life is filled with a superhuman power, there is a lack of happiness!</p>
<p>After getting off the train, we all boarded sedan chairs again. The young eunuchs carrying the chairs seemed to be running much faster than usual, although they were still carrying them very carefully. (261)</p>
<h3>A Retrospective of the Shanghai-Beijing Air Route (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Zhen Lü</p>
<p>At that time, about six li from Gaoqiao, in the middle of the fields, there was a shipbuilding bureau. Gaoqiao steamboats would often specifically stop at the river in front of the bureau, for the convenience of the Western couple at the bureau to go to Shanghai. This small instance of fawning on foreigners evokes a sense of national humiliation! Once, because the words of an officer on the steamboat offended a passenger, this passenger obtained permission from the Baoshan County government to also operate ferries and compete with the old transport businesses. This company sold tickets for only two copper coins per passenger, and the other company sold tickets at the same price, but added a towel for each passenger, each willing to lose money to achieve a monopoly. This is another manifestation of the national characteristic of being eager for private gain, a memorable scene!</p>
<p>The equipment on municipal steamboats has been upgraded, and passengers are happy to take them. However, the tea in the teapots installed on the boats is usually cold, regardless of winter or summer; there is no toilet paper in the restrooms, which is also difficult to provide on the boats; and so on. These seem to go against the original intentions of the designers. Although there is a suggestion box on the boat, it doesn't seem to have much impact. It is hoped that the operators will persevere and develop a bright future!</p>
<h3>Huang Huiwen's Last Poem</h3>
<p>— (Smile)</p>
<p>Huang Huiwen, an old professor at Peking University (excerpt), was a leading figure in contemporary poetics. His annotations of the ancient Yuefu, Cao Zhi, Xie Lingyun, Ruan Ji collections, as well as Mao Shi Zuan Ci, poetic rules, etc., have long been popular throughout the country. Unfortunately, he passed away last year. Chen Shuren, Ye Chucang, and others in Beijing are holding a memorial meeting. His poetry collection is named Haojialou, and it was printed by Wang Jingwei at his own expense last month, containing more than 600 poems. The poems written in Jiaxu also number ten, the last written poem being a quatrain to see Yu Yueyuan off on his return south: "National plans and personal schemes are not yet fully spoken, again pouring the remaining tears into the farewell cup. Tomorrow, seeing off a noble scholar returning, drunk before the lamp, resembling Ruan Yuan." His last poem in regulated verse was about being late for an appointment with Wang Qiumei to see the flowers, with the lines: "Dark rain and wind scatter upon ten thousand homes, the small building feels distant, like a speeding carriage. The invaders arrive, plants and trees compete for precedence, spring goes and comes in sunshine and rain, with a sigh. One night, the Ze Pu blows into snow, half the sky's Fei Fu looks like sunset clouds. An old man, with unlimited feelings, agrees to see flowers in the Thousand Li Autumn Studio." The Guangling melody is extinct, the Fa music fades away; reading this is also enough to know the profound sorrow of his embrace. Furthermore, in his poetry collection, there is also a poem of mine, which has not been engraved, written at the end of the Ren Shen year, when the national crisis was severe, hence the feelings of indignation and sadness at the times, revealed between the lines, with the lines: "The lament of a fallen country is full of thought and resentment, my poems are thus, almost made by Heaven. Desiring to exhaust worldly affairs to pass on to future generations, it is difficult to write all the short poems of the people. The Xi Ku Yi Chong only does not move, the Shi Fei Lu Yan, is there no danger? Heartbroken, people talk about governing the country, who says poetry can see my sorrow?" Places visited.</p>
<h3>Mao Gong Accumulation of Snow</h3>
<p>— Wu Yafei</p>
<p>In the Baoshan field, as long as there is a heavy snowfall, there will be a mountain range resembling a jade dragon entrenched on Chaoyang Mountain and Beiyin Mountain, and the snow here often does not completely melt away for more than half a month; this is one of the Eight Views of Dongting, "Mao Gong Accumulation of Snow." In the past, whenever it snowed, I would always step on the snow to go to Baoshanwu to see the plum blossoms and enjoy the snow scenery. Because there is also a large plum forest there, although it is not as famous as Dengwei Mountain's Fragrant Snow Sea, it also has the charm of faint fragrance and sparse shadows.</p>
<p>There, the mountains are deep and the forests are dense, with ancient temples and Sanskrit sounds, the mountains rising and falling, majestic and solemn. Placed among them, one almost suspects it is a paradise on earth, especially the clear, gurgling streams, playing a clanging music, harmonizing with the birds in the forest, singing the songs of nature, stirring up our infinite attachment.</p>
<p>It snowed heavily all day yesterday, and today it is probably "white snow fluttering, jade as a mountain range" again. Coincidentally, I have returned home, how could I miss that good opportunity; so today I went with Mei to Baoshan to step on the snow and admire the plum blossoms.</p>
<p>The weather was a bit overcast, but the wind was not strong. The two of us crossed a Bapao Mountain and walked onto the long and flat Changshan Road. The waxberry trees and old pine trees on both sides of the mountain were bowed down by the snow. Passing through the Red Mountain Gate, we arrived at the stone figures and stone horses. There was not much water left in the Yangshu Pond beside them, and there were three or five young monks playing in the snow on Little Tianzhu above.</p>
<p>"Let's go to Qingyun Temple for tea today." Mei was a bit tired from walking, so she planned to sit down at Qingyun Chan Temple. Qingyun Temple is directly across from Mao Gong Peak, which is a famous ancient temple.</p>
<p>"Okay, I'll ask the monks to prepare some food and we'll have lunch there before going up the mountain to enjoy the plum blossoms."</p>
<p>Walking across Xianghua Bridge, a very tall stone pagoda stood prominently on the slope of Chaoyang Mountain in front of the main hall. We walked into the main hall. The four strangely tall and large Demonic Heavenly Kings stood fearsomely on both sides. It was quiet inside, with no one in sight. I skillfully went to the abbot's room and saw a few young monks fanning the stove for tea.</p>
<p>After sitting for a short while, the young monks offered fragrant tea, cigarettes, and four plates of dried fruit. I took a sip of tea and could tell that it was a local product of Mao Gong Peak, "Ge Ting Biluochun," brewed with Chaoyang Spring water, so it was very clear, fragrant, and mellow. We were chatting and admiring the scenery behind the house when a monk in his forties came respectfully to clasp his hands together in front of us. This was Abbot Xinglong.</p>
<p>After lunch, we strolled along a narrow mountain path, admiring the white snow, plum blossoms, green pines, and ancient cypresses along the way, washing away all my worldly thoughts. At that time, I improvised a seven-character quatrain, but now I only remember the last two lines: "Deep in the mountains, the forest is even denser, when the plum blossoms bloom, the snow is also fragrant."</p>
<p>On the way back, we also picked two ghost buns and broke off two stalks of bamboo for making drums.</p>

<h3>The Literary Arena is Like the Battlefield</h3>
<p>— Erlang</p>
<p>I happened to see a new magazine and, as usual, flipped through it. There was a cartoon depicting two literary figures wielding pens in battle, titled "The Literary Arena is Like the Battlefield," which couldn't help but fill me with emotion.</p>
<p>"Literary figures disparaging each other" has "existed since ancient times," but it is truly "even more intense today." The matter of pen battles is greatly related to whether or not printing technology has been invented. The past is not like the present, which is even more obvious. (The difference in the ease of writing between the era of bamboo slips and lacquer writing and the era of repeated copying, compared with the modern era of developed printing technology, is like the difference between heaven and earth.)</p>
<p>"Pen battles," commonly known as "ink lawsuits," can be roughly divided into two categories: one is "debate," and the other is "mutual scolding." "Debate" is when individuals have different academic views or different arguments on doctrines and rely on theory to compete with each other. Therefore, it is also called "theoretical struggle." The common goal of those engaged in "theoretical struggle" is to clarify the truth; whoever's theory belongs to the side of truth, or is closer to the side of truth, the victory or defeat is obvious, and the reader can judge. "Mutual scolding" is different. Since both sides of the "pen battle" are not for the purpose of clarifying the truth, there is naturally nothing theoretical to say. Each shows their abilities, openly attacking and secretly ambushing, doing everything possible, even resorting to sophistry regardless of right and wrong. It is like clowns on a stage performing a duet, only striving for the applause and cheers of the audience (i.e., the readers).</p>
<p>In today's world, truth is ineffective, everyone says they are right, and "theoretical struggle" in the literary world is also "depressed," giving way to "miscellaneous essays" of mutual scolding. "The literary arena is like a theater" no longer has that kind of Yongzheng style of "issuing battle letters" and "laying out battle formations": once they come out, they raise guns and wave knives, and in addition to mixed killing, they release hidden weapons and poisonous gas, turning it into a "fight to the death" situation of "melee combat." And the "pen battle" of "mutual scolding" is now the prevalent phenomenon in the literary world.</p>
<p>The "pen battle" of "mutual scolding" has become a trend in the literary world, and there are "heroes" who are "flaunting their might" to promote this trend. It seems that it will continue to rise. Some people say that the "originator" of this trend does not know whether to take it as happiness or worry. I think this is a kind of "meritorious service," and the "originator" must take it as supreme glory and happiness.</p>
<p>Theoretical struggle is "depressed," and the "pen battle" of "mutual scolding" has become a trend—truth is crying. However, truth also seems to have reached an "unprosperous" era—isn't it? We can no longer see the "true face of Mount Lu"? What else is there to say?</p>
<p>"The literary arena is like the battlefield." On the surface, it looks very vigorous and energetic, but in reality, it is an unfortunate era of gloom and darkness in the literary world.</p>

<h3>Shantou Night</h3>
<p>— Xin'er</p>
<p>A memorable, cherished hometown!</p>
<p>Wandering the streets, looking at the sky, it's all a lost coldness. The whole body is sore and weak, the mind is dizzy and confused; towards the human world and life, everything feels lonely, strange, and tasteless. But sometimes, my mind insists on flashing back to that wisp of the sweet, past, gentle shadow of my hometown, causing me to feel a disturbing, sad, and unbearable sourness, always holding back tears in my stomach, with a sourness that wets the corners of my eyes.</p>
<p>Clenching my teeth and enduring my pain, I can often get through it calmly. But thinking of my hometown that gave birth to me, now a hometown weeping throughout the village, my mother in my hometown with tears flowing so much that her eyes are almost blind... I can't help but feel cruelly whipped! My limbs no longer have the strength to support this heavy body.</p>
<p>It seems, I often hear my mother scolding her heartless son for never writing home, but I still don't understand why I never even give my mother a message! What good is it to tell my mother? Saying that I have food to eat, why not send some to my parents! Saying that I am starving, then why tell them about starving!</p>
<p>"Heartless child!" When I hear this mournful sound, I don't want to live anymore. My heart, brain, and whole body are broken.</p>
<p>I have already set foot on the southern soil of my hometown, sleeping in the familiar atmosphere of my hometown's accent. But my heart is even more chaotic. Even more deeply, I recall the sorrow and bitterness of a wanderer's journey. Arriving in my hometown, hearing the familiar accent, my chest feels even more melancholic and chaotic.</p>
<p>It feels like stumbling into a strange and terrifying alien land. My hometown after five years of separation is completely different from the hometown in my memory. My heart aches even more than the heart of a homesick traveler! The scenery has changed drastically, and my mood is even more agitated. I am down and out, and my hometown is even more desolate! It's not the time to go back anymore!</p>
<p>Inside the quiet little inn, the sound of rickshaw bells from the streets far away is especially evocative of the hometown. In this sound approaching midnight, it is truly somewhat like the tone of a wind chime in the desert, as sung by poets, intermittent, gently carried by the southern breeze.</p>
<p>The sound of footsteps stirs outside and inside the door, and my heart jumps involuntarily. The sound of flutes and bamboo pipes suddenly rises, and the sound of small gongs rhythmically complements it. The children's songs play like a mournful complaint. My heart's waves resonate with the undulating and low song. This is even more of a lament of the hometown! The children who have fled from the countryside, singing the most touching tragic rural tunes to make a living, the elegance of the tone, is like a pitiful orphan crying and singing. The night is even more silent, people are even more melancholic, and the songs and music gradually become even more melancholic and melodious, a series of night songs from the hometown that knock on the heartstrings. The children's singing plays from one house to another, tossing and turning in bed, vaguely blurred, like being awake and yet in a dream. The unbearable disturbing mood, regretting that I should not have returned in vain, only adds to the painful homecoming. The gentle and bright Shantou, tonight only gives me infinite confusion. On the first night of stepping on the soil of my hometown, I am only more sad and chaotic! Hometown, I hate it, I wish it would be shattered into complete destruction! How much sorrow is imprinted on this night in Shantou!</p>

<h3>Random Maritime Notes</h3>
<p>— Luchun</p>
<p>On the Deck</p>
<p>A crescent moon hangs in a corner of the sky, and sparse stars dot the blue sky. I lean alone on the ship's railing, my heart filled with empty dismay, letting the sound of the waves disturb my lonely mood. This is just the season of early autumn, and the sea breeze brings a refreshing feeling, awakening the senses conquered by depression. I sit on a bamboo basket filled with pineapples, smelling the fragrant breath of the fruit.</p>
<p>I am a lonely traveler, bringing only a hopeful heart. In this vague journey of sea and sky, I sit precariously, thinking alone.</p>
<p>I ponder, trying to answer my own questions. However, if you were to ask me, what do I hope for, what do I pursue? I am hazy again.</p>
<p>However, I still ponder and think. I would rather be a seagull standing on the crest of the tide than a white heron standing still on the beach.</p>
<p>Sail Shadows</p>
<p>Looking south to my hometown, looking north to the future, to the east is the boundless sea, and to the west are the misty cloud mountains. Many sail shadows rise and fall with the waves over there, and they are probably people who make a living from the sea.</p>
<p>Indeed, many people praise the life of the sea master. Yes, the sea is azure, the sky is azure, and the setting sun paints the sea like red clouds, and the shocking waves surge with silver flowers. Who can say that the sea is not great, beautiful, and full of poetry!</p>
<p>However, who can say that the sea is not the abyss of sin? When I think of Ibanez's "Sea".</p>

<h3>A Voice for Lack of Freedom in Marriage</h3>
<p>Editor:</p>
<p>I now have a problem that I need to bother you with. Please take time out of your busy schedule to give me a reply.</p>
<p>I have a friend surnamed Huang, who is twenty-one years old and works in a bank. A year ago, he met a colleague, Miss Chen, who is seventeen years old. The two developed from friendship to love, and their passion reached a boiling point. They are determined to marry no one but her, and she is determined to marry no one but him. Therefore, Mr. Huang specifically proposed marriage to (Miss Chen's guardian, as Miss Chen's parents are deceased, and she has only an uncle as her guardian). However, her family is an old-fashioned, autocratic family, and he was rejected. Later, he requested several more times, but the results were all disappointing. As a result, the two of them neglected food and sleep and were about to go down the path of death. Fortunately, they were persuaded by friends, which prevented them from committing suicide. But what methods can be used to help them succeed? Now there are several questions below. Please, smart sir, give me a satisfactory answer!</p>
<p>(1) They are both of marriageable age. Can they get engaged and married on their own—with friends as witnesses—unrestrained by their families?</p>
<p>(2) Now, the woman's guardian—referring to her uncle—is going to promise her to someone else—not Mr. Huang—even though she has refused several times and is willing to die rather than marry him, he still disregards her wishes. What methods should be used to deal with this, and how should we arrange to resist it in the future?</p>
<p>(3) Can the two of them get married without being bound by their families—with friends as witnesses—to form a new family? Is this against the law? Respectfully, Zhang Jianqiu</p>
<p>Editor's note: The civil law stipulates that underage men and women should obtain the consent of their legal representative to enter into a marriage contract. Miss Chen is only seventeen years old, and her uncle (who is her legal representative) naturally has the right to supervise her marriage; if Miss Chen gets engaged to Mr. Huang regardless of everything without obtaining her uncle's permission, then this marriage contract is not legally valid. Therefore, the only thing that can be done about Huang Chen's marriage is to negotiate politely with the uncle. The best thing to do is to temporarily not mention the matter, and wait until she reaches adulthood, at which point she will have the right to be her own master, and everything will no longer be a problem. Therefore, we must advise both parties not to be negative. As long as their will is firm and they do not change halfway, then there will eventually be hope for success in the future. And not being able to get married temporarily does not hinder love at all; talking about love does not necessarily mean getting married!</p>
<p>In order to make it clearer for Mr. Zhang and others, the above questions are answered individually below.</p>
<p>(1) Men and women who have reached the age of marriage can get engaged and married on their own, unrestrained by their families. However, it must be done with a public ceremony and with two or more witnesses for it to be valid.</p>
<p>(2) The law stipulates that a marriage contract should be entered into by the male and female parties. The guardian does not have the right to enter into a marriage contract on their behalf, and the individual can deny it; and a marriage contract cannot be forcibly enforced.</p>
<p>(3) If the woman is underage and rashly goes out to get married, the man runs the risk of being accused of "enticement" or "rape." These are illegal things and must not be done.</p>

<p>The Estrangement Between Zhou and Zheng (Continued)</p>
<p>Before exchanging hostages, Zhou was the Emperor and Zheng was a feudal lord. After exchanging hostages, Zhou and Zheng were equals. What else was there to fear? The wheat of Wen and the grain of Luo could be carried away without regard. If King Ping had initially hated Zheng Bo and frequently attacked him, Zheng, though unruly, would have been no more than a rebellious subject. The Emperor's dignity would have remained intact. But by exchanging hostages, he treated himself as an equal nation and dared not act as the Emperor. As years and months passed, who knew Zhou as the ruler? Once military force was used without restraint, it was not a feudal lord rebelling against the Emperor, but feudal lords attacking each other. If Zhou had always acted as the Emperor, with supreme dignity and strict division, would Zheng dare to offend him? Only because Zhou treated himself as an equal nation, Zheng treated him as such, and the world treated him as such. Zuo Zhuan also treated him as an equal nation. It was not that Zhou did not attack himself, Zheng might not have dared to attack him. Zuo Zhuan could not escape the blame for the crime of lacking a king, and Zhou could also share the responsibility. However, the words of gentlemen recorded in Zuo Zhuan certainly came from Zuo's pen, but they also traced back to the arguments of gentlemen at that time. Their discussion of Zhou and Zheng generally referred to them as two countries, without any sense of importance, which meant that the so-called gentlemen of that time did not know there was a royal family. It was not enough to worry that the Rong and Di barbarians did not know there was a king. It was not enough to worry that the feudal lords did not know there was a king. But when those called gentlemen also did not know there was a king, who under heaven knew there was a royal family? This was what Confucius worried about, this was why the Spring and Autumn Annals were written, this was why the Spring and Autumn Annals began with King Ping.</p>

<h3>A Brief History of Film Development (10)</h3>
<p>— Wen Ying</p>
<p>(10) The Popularity of War Films During the European War</p>
<p>We have all seen many silent films, which are varied and diverse. There are countless types of "Western films," "war films," "family films," and "wild animal films." You might think that watching movies is like eating a course meal at a company, the waiter brings it out and we devour it. But you are mistaken. The film companies' production of films is not their own decision. In fact, they ask the audience what films to make, whether they like it or not.</p>
<p>But if you don't like watching a film, how do you let the filmmakers know? You don't need to sit in the cinema, restlessly tossing and turning. You don't need to write to the company to express your disappointment. Your only weapon is to not enter the cinema when you see the film, not to take out money to buy tickets. If the filmmakers can't get your dimes or dollars, they are simply at a loss.</p>
<p>Every time a new film is released, the filmmakers are always apprehensive, not knowing whether they can win the audience's welcome. If there were a genius filmmaker who could accurately predict the audience's likes and dislikes, he would have become a millionaire long ago. Therefore, the tycoons in the film industry today, who can maintain their position for decades, are almost always geniuses, or have learned considerable lessons from years of experience. But even they cannot fully grasp the audience's psychology.</p>
<p>The audience's likes and dislikes are fickle, even the audience themselves don't know. Often, the filmmakers discover what you like, but because they are too eager to please, they lose a lot of money. We can now talk about the war films during the European War. During the European War, the eyes of the American people were focused on the war in Europe, and everyone hated Kaiser Wilhelm. Therefore, war films that hated Germany became popular for a while. At that time, there was a film called "The Beast of Berlin." Of course, it was a curse on Kaiser Wilhelm, so it was especially in line with the tastes of the general audience at that time. Hollywood then produced a large number of such war films, and other films were put aside.</p>
<p>Of course, it took the filmmakers a lot of time to discover that the audience liked to watch war films, so by the time they rushed to produce them, the European War was nearing its end. When the armistice was announced, there were already dozens of war films that had been made, and there were certainly many more that were still in production, probably hundreds of them.</p>
<p>But now that the war was over, people relaxed, and they no longer hated Germany. What they needed now was to forget the pain of war and eliminate the traces of slaughter. This psychological reaction was sudden, but this small reversal ruined the filmmakers' millions of investments, because the films that were made later could not attract the audience. The audience is all-powerful, which is further proven here.</p>
<p>After many years, the wounds of war had healed, and hysteria had disappeared. A famous director, King Vidor, raised the idea of ​​making a war film again. He read a novel about the European War (Plumes) and wanted to bring it to the screen. But after the capitalists had experienced pain, they dared not try it again. But because King Vidor insisted on proceeding, they had to agree to him, so they and King Vidor agreed that the production cost should be kept to a minimum and should not exceed the scope of an ordinary "program film." They also revised the story of the novel again and again, and after it was completely unrecognizable, they had to change its name to (The Big Parade).</p>
<p>At that time, except for King Vidor, everyone did not expect the greatness of that (The Big Parade). King Vidor worked hard like a true artist. When he and a Peng Hailei adapted the script, they cleverly inserted (Tempo) - the Tempo of war - using the rhythm of a piano to control the program of the film's action. But other than this intentionally made Tempo, all the other beauty, brilliance, etc., happened accidentally in the photography studio. The most beautiful of these is the scene where the male and female protagonists chew gum on the set. (To be continued)</p>
<p>Film Review</p>
<h3>Review of "The Age of Innocence"</h3>
<p>— You Jing</p>
<p>The Age of Innocence - Showing at the Great Shanghai</p>
<p>This film, translated as "The Age of Innocence", is similar in its atmosphere of regret and lament to "The Life of Vergie Winters" - The Life of Vergie Winters, which also stars the same male protagonist, John Boles. The original author, Edith Wharton, shares a similar attitude towards the understanding and handling of love, and the worldview on which she bases it, with the original author of the latter, Louis Bromfield. Both start from an incomplete view of love, always considering the so-called "proper and courteous behavior", but in reality, they are aware that they are performing a decadent and sentimental tragedy. Precisely because subjectively they are confined to old circles, and conscientiously acting out sorrowful endurance, the objective impact on people is not profound.</p>
<p>The film unfolds a section of life in New York's high society in the mid-19th century. Like many other love stories, before the marriage of young lawyer Newland Archer to May Welland, Ellen Olenska, a young woman bound by worldly customs and unable to escape an unsatisfactory marriage, intrudes. The latter repeats the love of her youth because she entrusts Archer to handle divorce procedures. Here, the author exaggerates the old grandmother - an extremely powerful noblewoman - who strongly opposes such things as divorce at that time, and forces Ellen to succumb to etiquette. At the same time, she uses another young man's announcement of the secret between Ellen and Archer to emphasize the helpless situation of the people in the play? When viewed from the old expression method here; the technique is quite acceptable.</p>
<p>The plot takes Ellen's sacrifice and Archer's marriage to May as a major turning point, and plunges even deeper into the tragedy, culminating in the newlywed's hidden love flame and Ellen's quiet departure.</p>
<p>The entire film is performed in the style of a novel, beginning when Archer is already old and a grandfather, telling this painful page as a story to his young grandson in the car late at night. Finally, it ends with his memories of completely changed scenery, and a reprint of Ellen's tearful farewell.</p>
<p>The atmosphere of tragedy in the film is quite strong. Therefore, it also loses to dullness, gloom, and rigidity. The solemn picture woven from clothing, pace, sitting and standing, daily life, and "proper and courteous" kissing, is like a glass of stale wine that does not quite suit the taste for audiences accustomed to the current Hollywood-style male and female lifestyles. Director Philip Moeller tried his best to get the maid to act in order to avoid dullness, but it was quite a loss.</p>
<p>The music as a sound effect is quite noteworthy here. In the six or seven places where there is music in the film, except for the violin performance and the wedding piano sound, which are both frontal applications in the play, coming with the Katul scene, the rest are mostly used appropriately when the silent scene progresses to the necessary time to maximize its effect. This is a correction to some films that overuse music.</p>
<p>The photography is extremely quiet and beautiful, and the light is quite able to follow the plot and become bright and stagnant. It's just that the several frost and flower leaf Katuls in the middle that show the passage of time are a bit too long.</p>
<p>In terms of actors, John Boles's demeanor and movements, as well as his inner performance, are quite successful. The heroine Irene Dunne is not tragic enough. It is Laura Hope Crews, who plays the old grandmother, who is very successful. It is said that she and the other four supporting actors are all famous actors on the New York stage. This is revealed in their steady style.</p>
<h3>Review of "The Siren" — Jin Cheng</h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>Due to the premiere of "Good Night", Mr. Yang Xiaozhong was praised for his proactive anti-feudal stance. It is very obvious that when a film profoundly criticizes reality and bravely expresses anti-feudal ideas, we are easily moved by the author's enthusiasm.</p>
<p>Not long ago, we also appreciated his "The Red Sheep Heroes", which is a work of considerable contemporary significance in the present time of national crisis, although it inevitably contains some shortcomings in its creative methods.</p>
<p>In this "The Siren", the author clearly implies that the city is a vortex of sin. When honest and simple young farmers step into the city from the countryside and are seduced by material things, the result is the destruction of their families and the ruin of everything. We have encountered many similar themes in American films such as "The Way of All Flesh". They often oppose the city and the countryside, with the city being a den of sin and the countryside being pure and lovely. Therefore, they praise the countryside and curse the city, resulting in people having wonderful nostalgic thoughts about the countryside from the cruel urban reality. But is this actually the case? The city and the countryside are not essentially different. While the darkness of the city is certainly evaluated as being of low value from a moral perspective, there are also undeniable evils in the countryside. The so-called simple countryside of the Middle Ages no longer exists in this era of the twentieth century.</p>
<p>Thus, the reasoning in "The Siren" is naturally just a superficial observation. When the sins in the city are most clearly expressed, the author only sees that the city is a vortex of sin, only sees that women are as terrible as sirens, while portraying the countryside as a place of peaceful and happy life (at least we don't see why the young farmer went to the city). In reality, there are local tyrants and evil gentry in the countryside, as well as natural and man-made disasters that completely bankrupt the countryside, etc. The author has not unearthed any of these terrible phenomena and darkness.</p>
<p>If "The Siren" were deep enough, many more essential connections could at least be explored from the so-called courtesan siren, but here, it only sees her teasing a young and strong chauffeur for no reason. Precisely because the superficial phenomena are described, precisely because it only starts from a moral perspective, the farmer's wife ultimately "forgives" her husband, and the farmer also "forgives" the siren for no reason. We do not advocate personal revenge, but where does the author teach the young man to go in a daze? This is what we want to ask. As for giving people uncritical sympathy for the farmer's wife, it inevitably leaves behind the role of feudal preaching, although we do not think it is a conscious expression.</p>
<p>As the author said in his "Confession," "This play focuses on the fullness of emotions..." There are some successful expressions in the description of inner feelings. However, in terms of the entire performance technique, the content is not fully expressed. The most important thing is the redundancy and chaos, and the inability to introduce the characters in the play in a more compact and clear way, such as Zhang Yi being mistaken for his substitute by a man in the mansion, and people predicting that Zhang Yi will have no good results when he moves, are all as bizarre preaching as so-called "slogans". If this film were to undergo a good reorganization, at least much glue could be saved). As for the slow speed, etc., they are secondary shortcomings. He, like the chauffeur's son dying unexpectedly, does not transform the reason for being crushed into a picture, and then Zhang Yi goes home still so slowly, all show the director's improper weaving method. Therefore, the acting skills of Liang Saizhen and Zhang Yi are very good in some scenes, but very stiff in others.</p>
<p>The author said well in the confession, "... But singing high-pitched tunes with empty content, making the plot of the whole play a background for slogans, is a loss." This is because the active content cannot be expressed by film art, and what is left behind is just a slogan, not art. But we cannot, like soft-hearted gentlemen, oppose artistic value and social value. The correct and artistic in-depth description of reality naturally has a very high social evaluation. I wonder what the author thinks of this explanation? At the same time, precisely because the author is sincerely receiving all serious criticisms, I sincerely discuss the above with the author.</p>
<p>Film Novel</p>
<h3>Anecdotes of Wellington (The Iron Duke) (2)</h3>
<p>— Xin Zhi</p>
<p>That was Louis XVI's niece, Marie Antoinette's daughter, the Duchess of Angoulême. She was a clever and cunning woman. Her whole body was filled with Bourbon blood, and she was determined to avenge her murdered mother. She also hated the people who united to drive Napoleon out of the country, because their achievements invisibly showed the weakness and incompetence of the Bourbons.</p>
<p>But her disgust for Wellington was not just this: she hated him because he was the one who supported her uncle as the Emperor of France, and his power was greater than hers. So now, when the Duke of Wellington was sitting at the Vienna Conference table, he was not thinking about those monarchs and kings, but about this resourceful woman (her image was constantly rippling in his mind, but it was the greatest obstacle to the future peace of Europe.</p>
<p>At this time, the King of Prussia was still roaring: "Prussia must obtain the land of Holland and Upper Lorraine in order to preserve Prussia's safety..." Suddenly, a timid and bloodless secretary walked on tiptoe to Wellington's side and handed him a folded piece of paper, then tiptoed out silently. Everyone was still arguing, sometimes the Russian envoys, sometimes the King of Prussia, all arguing endlessly and without result. Only Wellington sat alone without moving. He slowly unfolded the piece of paper.</p>
<p>Metternich suddenly said impatiently: "We must come up with a certain method, we cannot always argue like this." After he finished speaking, he turned to the Duke of Wellington and said: "Duke, what is your opinion?" The Duke of Wellington said with a sarcastic tone: "I think the skin of this lion is not big enough."</p>
<p>After he said this, everyone was silent, looking at each other, feeling that they had been mercilessly ridiculed, but the fact was indeed the case, making them unable to express their anger. But Wellington ignored their shame and anger, he was looking at the note he had just received. After reading it, he suddenly stood up with anger on his face, his anger turned into a kind of disdainful expression, saying: "I will add one more sentence. The skin of this lion has also been divided too early. He is not dead yet. Napoleon has escaped from Elba"!</p>
<p>As he said this, he swept his eyes over the people at the conference table. Everyone who heard this was as if a thunderbolt had struck on a clear day, and everyone was silent for a long time, pondering the important meaning of this news... Napoleon had escaped from his cage! Returned to his hometown of France, and drove straight into Paris!</p>
<p>Talleyrand was the first to recover his throat. He said to Wellington: "He must go to Switzerland first." Wellington said: "He is already marching towards Paris! Mr. Talleyrand, please notify King Louis immediately and tell him to leave Paris immediately. Let him go to Ghent and take his family back." Talleyrand smiled when he heard Wellington mention King Louis's family, but Wellington said again: "But it would be better not to take them."</p>
<p>After he finished speaking, he said to the many people at the conference table: "This conference is now over. We will reconvene after we defeat Napoleon again, but that cannot be done in five minutes." One of the representatives said: "We don't need to worry. Let him come again, but he no longer has an army." Wellington said: "Army? They will rush to join him from all the forts, towns, and villages. He only needs to hiss once, and they will all come. That person refused to accept and said: "What does he have to give them?" Wellington smiled dryly: "Land. Don't forget. Land was once in his hands." (To be continued)</p>
