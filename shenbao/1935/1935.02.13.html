<p>時評</p>
<h3>推廣造林說愼</h3>
<p>浙江省政府因爲近年來浙江境内修築了二千五百七十餘公里的公路擬在道路兩旁。種植樹木。估計要植三十萬株左右。這在消極的意義上。足以鞏固路基。增添路上的景色。在積極的意義上。足以啟發新建設的興趣。這些樹木。將來也有實際的用處。</p>
<p>我們中國本來是天產豐富人爲優越的國家。但是近百年與世界各國接觸以來。我們豐富的天產未能開發優越的人工。也落下乘。僅僅依憑自然。保持着農業民族的面目。别人日進千里。我們却差不多停滯在這裏。卽有一點進步。也是非常遲緩。其速度的差别。好像牛車與飛機之比。如此相形之下。我國農業手工業的長處。也漸覺淹没。破敗的景象就更顯露出來了。例如木材的出產爲農業國家的副產品。至少也應該能够自給。但是事實竟相反。大都市上的建築。固然用外國輸入的木材。卽中小城市。也用外國木材了。由此反映出農業經營者祗顧目前生活利得没有餘力打算到稍撤長遠的事業。　　中國實際的窮乏狀况。恐怕還不止如此。許多名山勝景。如杭州西湖的週圍各山。如普陀島上。並不一定没有財力去經營植樹。也不是没有空地以供種植。乃竟使許多的山。成爲毫無顏色的童山。偶爾因某種禽鳥的機緣。長出一兩株樹。作爲風景的點綴。實際上並無多大補益。卽於整個山色。也没有什麽好處况當霉雨時節。偶然雨量稍多。就會洪水成災若雨量略少。就會荒旱少有週轉調劑的餘地。地面所含水分减少。長久如此。很有轉成爲沙漠的危慮。隴海路上從商丘至中牟一帶這樣景象。特别明顯。</p>
<p>最近幾年以來。金國上下。漸次明白推廣造林的需要。不單是點綴風景而已并且於農業的耕作。氣候的調節。也有很大的關係。所以植林的提倡。是通國皆知有好些地方。也確努力進行。種了不少的樹木。不過造林這件事。說起來很是稀鬆平常。需要多種。大家也没有什麽疑問祗是實行的時候。立刻就發行許多不易解决的問題。㈠現時種地的農人。在最普遍的情形下。是人口多。土地少。土地不會增長。而吃飯的人則日見加添。因之他們要盡量開闢地力。不顧令眼前看不見好處的樹木。遮蔽了他們生產的熱地。㈡農人保守性雖强。對於長遠的將來施設。在生活尙未安定期中。也無暇打算。所以對植樹。非但不熱心努力。并且有時候還要摧殘旣成的樹木。㈢地方已盡民力已疲的現在。卽有意於植林。也無從着手。因爲樹苗來源缺乏。甚至没有財力去購買。㈣因爲交通不便。想到較爲偏僻的地方。縱樹木滿山。也無法輸運。且捐稅又重。不免卽要却顧起來。如今日報載建木商之呼籲。卽爲捐重之故。　　現在通國皆知。對於樹木任其「自生自長。」决不是辦法。况且「自生自長。」要很長久的時間。故適當的培植。爲目前必要的事。樹木培植法。在技術上且待專門家討論。今日祇就一般情形講。第一·須戒除人爲的摧殘。使多數農人。知道植林的重要。第二·凡公有荒山。應由地方政府籌劃種植。并選擇適宜於該地土壤的植物。更要估量到經過若干時期後採伐一次。以除舊佈新。用途何如。也要有一種計劃。其收效縱然要在十年二十年以致更遠的時間以後。而無形的調節氣候。有形的特别收入。也是巨大的利益。所以我們以爲造林運動。該遍及於全國。尤期是多山的區域。</p>
<h3>意壓迫阿比西尼軍事外交並進</h3>

<p>意軍隊動員待機進攻</p>
<p>阿人抱最後抵抗决心</p>
<p>（羅馬）在此意阿戰爭濃雲密雨之時、意國對阿特提五項要求、㈠爲阿國賠償意國損失、據謂已定一百萬金鎊、㈡阿政府正式道歉、㈢派一阿人對意大利國旗致敬、㈣組織意阿邊疆委員會、㈤阿人不得侵犯意邊疆、與此五項要求同時傳出之消息、卽意政府已任命葛拉臣將軍爲征阿軍統師、葛氏曾平里比亞土人之亂、對於應付殖民地人民具有經騐、最近彼又曾率軍駐戍奥國邊疆、意方消息、阿國軍隊集結意邊者約有三萬餘人云、（十二日國民電）</p>
<p>又電　在此意阿戰爭、同時動員儘在進行、外交方法亦復採用、如意國要求賠償損失、卽其一端、此種談判、可使事態轉趨和緩、啟一解决爭端之途徑、據說國聯爲使意阿邊疆成立一合理界綫、已委任一混合委員會、辦理此事、以免日後再起不幸事件、（十二日國民電）</p>
<p>（羅馬）駐意阿國代辦今日語路透訪員、謂如意國欲與阿國開釁、則阿國擬保衛疆土至最後一人、阿國有武裝兵八十萬人、更能續募一百萬人、阿國有新時代之戰器、獨缺坦克車與飛機耳、聞意兵屯集於伊里特里者已有四萬人云、據意政府今日宣稱、解决爭案之談判、現正在阿京進行中云、（十一日路透電）</p>
<p>阿比亞尼亞　此間因意大利已動員、爲應付意兵侵入計、山堡中之兵士近開始試放來福槍、據說阿國應付意國之軍隊已調動五萬至八萬、皆帶有新式武器及機關槍、同時意大利之動員、已使國際局勢爲之嚴重、阿國戰士習慣高原生活、驍勇猛騺、終局或許意國勝利、然事情亦並不如所料之簡單、因現値雨季、大隊行軍殊多不便、唯意國繼續動員、故戰爭空氣頗爲濃厚、（十一日國民電）</p>
<p>（羅馬）現信意政府仍將力避與阿比西尼亞開釁、今日官塲解釋動員　陸軍兩師之理由、謂阿國現屯兵三萬於邊界、且可續出兵十萬名、意國爲未兩綢繆計、不得不備援軍、以衛意國殖民地、並取避免續起邊界衝突之步驟云、當局又稱、所動員之兩師、一駐佛洛倫斯、一駐美西那、共兵三萬名、凖備於必要時進攻阿國、駐羅馬阿國代辦今日下午曾至意外交部討論此事、（十一日路透電）</p>
<p>（羅馬）意相墨索里尼已向阿比西尼亞提出抗議、大意謂意大利已忍無可忍、如外交方面不能使意國充分滿意、則意國已凖備在阿國及意屬索瑪里倫邊境作戰云、據政府解釋、意國以爲近來屢次攻擊意軍之阿國游擊隊、必須澈底銷滅、再阿國在邊境有武裝軍隊甚多、此等兵士亦屢擾邊安、墨氏已大爲震怒、蓋此等現狀並非言之過甚、政会已絶端鎭靜、惟至此已必須澈底解决矣云、據阿國消靜、謂該國官塲不信意大利能於此時䨙雨之季採取攻勢、因邊境絶難行軍、現在外交關係雖甚緊張、然官塲方面仍希望戰事可以避免云、至於意國方面、則對於氣候問題絶不注意、蓋如不再採取斷然手段、邊境紛擾將永無止日、故軍隊業已凖備、隨時可以出發、惟卽使戰事發生、恐意國亦將如日本在滿·及美國在尼加拉圭·不致正式宣戰、而墨索里尼之軍隊將直接進佔阿境、以俟事件結束、至意國政府滿意爲止、阿國軍隊亦頗不少、如迫不得已、或亦將盡力抵抗、據觀察者咸謂此種抵抗在重砲坦克車等等精良利器之下、終難持久耳、（十一日國民電）</p>

<h3>意軍動員眞相</h3>
<p>（羅馬）意阿衝突事件、發生已有多時、今始公之於世、同時意國動員之實在時日、與宣佈時期、亦相差甚巨、此種辦法已引起此間政界之種種謠諑、有謂全部事實之眞相、猶不如是、有謂所動員者不僅爲一九一一年所生之預備員、卽一九○八年至一九一二年所生者亦已動員矣、有謂所有戰鬥人員皆已動員、其中有數部分、卽將一二日内遣送海外、眞相如何雖尙難明瞭、唯一般人皆以爲意大利决對阿國作大規模之行動、使阿國就範、唯現在適値雨季、惡戰恐尙不致發生云、（十二日國民電）</p>

<p>（倫敦）政府印度案現已二讀通過、當辯論之際、自治領土地位之問题辯論最烈、檢事長殷斯基甫聲稱、就印度所可施用之自治領土地位而言、威斯明斯特法典予以無限制之立法權、惟不得涉及妨害憲法之事件、雖賦以平等地位、但須始終在英帝國之内、並未有印度有權可脫離帝國之問題、凡英國對於印度之各種諾言、皆以印度不脫離帝國爲條件云、素來對亽印度案抨擊頗烈之邱吉爾起而發言、但此次言詞之温和、出人意外、謂渠與友人不欲有所留難、渠主張首先許各省自治、而使中央政府得以干涉制止公共事業之退化、其所以有此主張者、蓋深覺保障民衆利益之需要也、若以政權給與少數人之計畫、殊與民治主義相反云、工黨領袖藍斯堡謂此案之編製、未曾眞正商諸印人、渠以爲應由印人自製一種計畫而提出之、此種計畫應具有退出帝國之理論上的權利、與其他自治領土相同、惟渠深信印度絶不行使此種權利也云、樞密院長包爾温稱、及時而與之寬大讓步、已獲取印度對於帝國之忠貞、吾人現以一種機會伐獻印度、使之作一大步驟、以成帝國中完全之一份子、吾人宜以願意慷慨與信任之精神供獻此種機會云（十一日路透電）</p>

<h3>對日的兩條綫（三續）林柏生</h3>
<p>···讀徐道鄰「中日關係的檢討」書後···</p>
<p>本年一月八日汪精衛氏在國民政府紀念週演講，除前記關於外交的作用者之外，尙有一段很重要的說話，對於今年的國際形勢，分析得極爲透闢，均未經發表，今並錄於次，以供參證。汪氏說：</p>
<p>「照個人觀察，今年的國際形勢，歐洲方面是保障和平的，而東亞方面，則向着和平没有保障的一條路走。</p>
<p>先說歐洲。法國外交總長已起程赴羅馬了，法意兩國，自歐戰結束以後，積不相能，有好幾次兩國形勢，非常緊張，如今法意兩國外交當局之會見，雖然截至現在，尙未有結果，但其爲防止惡化，努力於形勢之好轉，是無疑的，法意兩國形勢好轉，則中歐德奥匈捷等國形勢，必然因以安定，縱有波瀾，不難平息，證之去年奥國首相被刺，德奥關係，非常危殆，因意法之態度一致，德國表示無助長奥國内亂之意，奥國内亂，也就平息，是則意法之形勢好轉，有關於中歐之和平維持是無疑義的，中歐和平旣然維持，則歐洲和平，亦可以維持了。</p>
<p>我們於此，必須知道，歐洲之和平維持，决非偶然，那是由於歐洲一般人民都有維持和平之要求，所以縱然有少數興風作浪的人物，以及有偶然興風作浪的機會，終爲一般人民維持和平之要求所束縛，而不得逞，一般人民何以要求維持和平，如此熱烈，如此堅决呢？這裏頭似乎有兩個原故：第一，照歐洲歷史看來，每逢一次大戰之後，至少須要百數十年的休息，因爲大戰之後，一般人民創鉅痛深，生命之損失，財產之消耗，不易恢復，孤兒寡婦的哭聲，自都市以致鄉村，歷歷可聞，所以大戰復起的興頭，極其薄弱，而和平休息之心事乃牢不可破，自一八一四年拿破崙大戰結束之後，至一九一四年世界大戰方纔開始，整整的一百年，這一百年之中，固然有一二國，以至二三國間的戰爭，但不是歐洲的共同戰爭，例如普丹普奥普法之戰，不過二國，薩的尼亞和奥國的戰，有法國拿破崙第三參加，苦利米亞之戰，爲英法對俄，亦不過三國，又如巴爾幹半島各小國之戰，雖有三四國以上，但皆是小國，英俄德法等列强，并未加入，所以說歐洲的大戰歷百數十年而一遇，在歷史上是有證據的。第二，歐洲各國壤地相接，因交通發達的原故，其錯雜關係，益开密切，漸漸做到不戰則已，戰則必至牽連數國，很少很少可以單獨行動的，其在平時旣彼此致力於接攏，則在戰時，自然如弩之併發，這種趨勢，自有所謂同盟國恊商國以來，而益加明顯。以上兩點，一是就時間上看，一是就空間上看，因爲大戰的損失太大，牽連太多，所以人民厭惡戰爭，維持和平要求，因之十分迫切，雖然現在歐洲各國，仍在武裝和平的現象下過生活，大戰的爆發，具備可能，而何時爆發，從那一點爆發，則誰也不能斷定，而其維持和平之努力，則是一般人民所同的，因之政府也就不敢輕易出爲戎首了。</p>
<p>再就東亞來說。中國現在無所謂和平，因爲和平兩字顧名思義，必平而後能和，反言之，則不平未有能和者，所以中國目前，只有所謂忍辱負重，求亡圖存，和平兩字，直不配講。至於日本，甲午一戰，勝了中國，得了二萬萬兩的賠欵，以及台灣及澎湖列島的割讓，甲辰一戰，勝了俄國，繼承俄國在東三省所得的權利和利益，而列加擴張，甲寅一戰，勝了德國，取得了德國在山東所遺失的權利及利益，每十年一戰的結果，所得和甜頭多，苦頭少，而且三戰之中，只算得日俄之戰犧牲較大，所付的代價較重，但也不能與歐戰時的犧牲代價，相提并論，至於中日之戰，因滿洲政府腐敗的結果，實没有費了多大的力量，至於日德之戰，則所攻取的不過一個膠州灣，所犧牲更是輕微了，一般人民旣然嘗得戰爭的甜頭，而未嘗得戰爭的苦頭，自然覺得戰爭不是可厭惡的事，甚至以爲一切的問題，取决於戰爭，較之取决於和平手段，較爲痛快。加之東亞關係，不如歐洲的複雜，因爲歐洲先有幾個大强國，勢均力敵，互相對抗，還有許多小强國，夾雜其間，趨舍從違，隨時有舉足輕重之勢，平時關係複雜，互相顧忌，互相牽制，戰時的併發性，遂勃然莫之能遏，東亞現在，幾乎只是中日兩國，俄國雖然接壞，而距離較遠，英法美各國對於東亞，雖然有經濟貿易種種關係，而遠不如在歐洲之犬牙相錯，息息相關。所以各國在歐洲則努力於維持和平，而在東亞，則關心雖同，努力的程度，却相差甚遠，好戰的心理如此其濃厚，而維持和平的努力，如此其薄弱，所以東亞的和平前途，實不能與歐洲同日而語的。</p>
<p>徴之近事，日本退出國聯，至本年三月，已經滿期了，而華盛頓九國公約，日本已於去年十二月杪通告廢止了，兩種維持和平的保障，已經不復存在，則東亞和平，可以說没有保障了。</p>
<p>有些人說，華盛頓九國公約的意義，固然在尊重維持中國主權領土之獨立與完整，而尤其在海縮；關係海縮，英美如果一致，日本决不能不屈服，不但此也，即以英美海軍之力臨於日本，亦隨時可以制勝。固然，英美一致，其力量增長是無疑的，但我們還須加以分析。第一：如果英美一致以海軍之力臨於日本，則日本必然取守勢，英美海軍數量，固較日本爲强，而攻勢所需的數量亦較守勢爲多。第二：英國的海軍，先要維持地中海的威權，大西洋的威權，印度洋的威權，然後進而維持太平洋的威權，正所謂備多力分，不能集中於一點。第三：現在各國海軍正在競爭，譬如跑馬，已經跑至第一二匹的，决不願第三四匹奪之而前，英美海軍與日本相攻擊，即使得到勝利，終不免有所犧牲，海軍與陸軍不同，一隻軍艦之養成，需要許多時日，尤其是大艦，如果犧牲了去，則其第一把第二把的交椅，不免讓之第三第四者了，這是必不能免的顧慮。以上三者，不過舉例，其他類此者尙多。英美一致牽制力量，尙且没有絶對把握，何况現在英美並未一致呢？然則剛纔所說，好戰的心理，極其濃厚，而維持和平的努力，極其薄弱，是東亞方面最大的危機，誰也應該深切注意的。</p>
<p>明白了今年國際的形勢，與中國所處的環境，則我們努力的方向，可以想出一個决定了。」（完）</p>

<p>敎育消息</p>
<h3>敎部着手編訂大學課程綱目</h3>
<p>以謀適應二十七年大學會考</p>
<p>敎部對於普通敎育之中小學課程標準以及師範職業各校之課程或敎材綱要編訂公布後、對於高等敎育之大學各學院課程、去年已先從醫學做起、業經召集醫學敎育委員會開會數次、討論醫學院等課程標準草案、經推員修訂整理、不久將由敎部再召集一次會議、即可作最後之决定、敎部第二步本已從事、編訂大學其他各學院課程、適考選委員會函知銓叙會議、决議大學於二十七年會考、囑事先編訂大學課程標準、以謀適應、敎部本諸前定計畫、現已通盤草擬大學各學院課程綱目、並已函復考選委員會說明正在編訂課程大綱情形、查大學課程之編訂、在民國十九年時已有所編訂、彼時所訂對於大學各科課程之詳細内容、都逐一列舉、比較繁複、各大學實行方面較爲困難、聞此次所草擬列舉綱目比較具體、易於普遍照行云、</p>
<h3>浙省地方敎育破產</h3>
<p>敎廳長許紹棣瀝述原因及其補救辦法</p>
<p>浙江敎育廳長許紹棣、昨在省政府紀念週、報告如何保障地方敎育經費、略謂、今天想說的是地方敎育經費問題、去年因爲災荒同其他原因、地方敎育經費、已經到破產的狀態、各縣停辦的小學、爲數達一千以上、總計浙西三舊府屬各縣不足經費六十九萬元、浙東八舊府屬共一百十餘萬元、這裏我們要注意的、是區立私立的小學經費、尙未計算在内、經費旣如此短絀、則已成的事業、多無法維持、現在江山·桐廬·東陽等縣、停辦的小學、均在七八十所以上、餘杭·上虞·湯溪·淳安·遂安等縣、亦各有四五十所小學未能開學、各縣敎育經費積欠、少則四五月、多則八九月、至鄉鎭小學的補助費、如衢縣有積欠三年之久、服務小學的人員、生活本已十分艱苦、遇到這種雪上加霜的情形、其痛深苦絶、更可想而知、兄弟以爲人類如果没有喪失同情心、對於遭受這種痛苦的敎育人員、　　　　　切的注意、地方敎育經費之所以如此困難、原因甚爲複雜查全省各縣敎費、總計約三百卅萬元、其中屬於田賦帶征及學田租金者約二百廿萬、所以一遇荒歉、田賦滯收、敎育隨之動搖、去年旱災、各縣收成、統扯四成，敎費要短少一百卅萬之鉅、所以歉收爲敎費短絀第一原因、其次、歷年農村衰落、影響於一般農村經濟、各種敎欵隨之减少、此其二、各縣縣長或財務機關、往往挪移敎費、此其三、捐稅的征收、學產的保管、不免有中飽或其他舞弊情事、此其四、預算不確、虛列過多、或擴充過度、支出逾額、因此收支不符、愈見竭蹶、此其五、省欵撥補、已兩重八折、現在又要緊縮、實收僅及五成、此其六、各地奉令廢止苛稅、同時没有籌補、此其七、本省地方敎費、旣如上述、如不急爲設法、勢必至於破產、我們一方面喊普及敎育、掃除文盲、而現在連已有的敎育事業、都不能維持、未免太矛盾了、兄弟以爲目前祗能講救急與維持、希望財政廳能從速把一百萬公債、撥交保管委員會、使救濟事業。得以進行、至於積極的工作、希望全省敎育界同人及熱心敎育的各界全體動員、㈠欲求敎費收入有保障、各縣應仿照省敎費保障辦法、設法使敎費獨立、在統收統支原則下、指定可靠的收入作爲敎費專欵、㈡積極整理地方敎育欵產、嚴定保管辦法、不至被少數人把持呑没、或被别種機關移用、㈢奬勵捐資興學、使詞產·私產·能多量變爲學產、㈣舉辦敎育儲蓄、查全省小學生七十餘萬人、每人每年儲蓄半元、小學敎員二萬餘人、儲蓄一元、又縣立市立中學學生敎職員共约八千人、每人儲一元半、又得萬餘元、共總一年可得四十餘萬元、積之十年、可得四百餘萬元、五十年後可增至幾千萬元、那時息金所得已足用了、㈤舉辦積儲地方敎費募捐運動、由各縣分進行、我想必有不少樂捐的人、此項捐欵、一槪撥作基金、永遠不許移用、以上幾種保障地方敎育經費辦法、願全省人士、亟起圖之、更望敎育界能奮勇前驅、一致來保成這件事體、</p>
<h3>全國勞展總評判報告（五）</h3>
<p>㈢小學勞作課程標準中、各於利用當地特產原料、甚爲重視、惟在本屆展覽會中、此項出品不多、即著名原料、如宜興之陶土、江西之瓷土、山東之麥桿、亦未見有全力利用以之製成出品者（職業學校出品除外）注意利用當地原料者、計惟山東掖縣初中及黃縣聖泉小學之石彫、福建省立第二小學之竹器、及靑海甘肅之毛絨製物等數種、</p>
<p>㈣應用智慧構成物品、乃工藝製造中最重要之條件、製造品之能日新月異、均爲應用此原則之產物、此次出品中具有此項條件者甚多、尤顯著者、如福建小學、以一個銅元爲原料、製成徽章鈕扣及各項小件銅器、輕而易舉、頗見巧思、湖南自治小學及女子職業學校、以鈕扣連結而成花瓶、亦極精巧、廣西興業中學之袖珍測量儀、製法簡易、構造合法、山東博衛小學之警鈴、應用電力以報警、又有電鎖、應用電力以鎖閉門户、均頗有思想、又合實用、江蘇省立鎭師附小以色彩明、暗濃、淡之鷄、鴨蛋穀、嵌成肖像、利用尋常廢物、而成此清雅美觀之成績、亦屬别開生面者、安徽省會十五小學之木製磅秤、江西省會將軍渡小學之木製天秤、捕鼠籠、湖北漢口市立第五小學利用細松枝、粗松叚、製成馬、鹿等動物雛形多種、且具坐臥走立各種姿勢、均屬妙想巧構、</p>
<p>㈤此次出品中、對於敎具及其他器械之發明極少、僅凌君平之彈簧算盤（嘉定普通小學）、及賡甫水車（江蘇省之淮師）尙有意義、凌君所發明之彈簧算盤、更屬成品優良、切合實際應用、似應奬勵提倡、</p>
<p>㈥小學勞作課程標凖、範圍甚廣、故師範生所習之勞作、應以小學之全部課程爲範圍、但時期有吳、如何實施方能達到此目的、尙屬一應研究之問題、茲見安徽黃家獅小學各項工藝基本製作法標本、及浙江嘉興中學之工藝構成標本（他處間亦有之、茲舉　例而已）將小學課程中工藝部份之基本製作法、全部包含、習之則全課程之基本方法、已能完全了解、故師範生之工藝、可以上列材料爲中心敎材、另外再選小學敎育有關係之玩具、敎具儀器、以爲應用、則敎學之目的與應用、及學習之時间、均能解决矣、</p>
<p>㈦此次關於國防方面敎材、爲數雖不少、但除上海市和安小學之國防設計、較有意義外、其他各校、僅僅製作幾種砲、槍、飛機、兵艦等模型、價値甚微、此後應視學生程度、注意戰壕構築、民衆防空、防毒、等種種用品及模型之製作、俾得與學生以深刻的印象、且較切於適用、</p>
<p>㈧關於勞作科應用之各種材料、及各種工作過</p>
<p>程等標本、實爲勞作敎學時必需的參考品、惟此種參考品、在本國目下、尙無現成商品出售、全賴各校平時搜集製造、師範學校勞作料、應以此項參考品、爲重要工作、以便學生畢業後服務小學時、能各自製作敎具、但此次出品中、關於此項成績、僅有浙江之嘉興中學、及黃家獅小學、更能依據勞作科課程標準、搜集製作、完備而有組織、應加奬勵、</p>
<p>㈨此次工業出品、附送學生自繪之工作圖者甚少、按我國各校勞作敎學、工藝品之製作、大都並不先繪工作圖而任意爲之、故在製作品未完成以前、作者之意象及製作品之形式、他人往往不得而知、以是、學生對正式的工作圖不但不能繪製、並且不能認識、實與我國工藝改進前途、影響甚大、此後勞作科工藝製作、應注意工作圖、以養成學生製圖及識圖能力、</p>
<p>㈩小件竹工製作物、幾爲最普遍之出品、估計其數量、殆爲各出品冠、其所以成此現象者、殆以勞作敎育、雖經政府一再提倡、然實際上能重視而實施之學校、尙屬極少數、在此種狀態之下、學校無工具設備以利工作、家庭無材料供給以供練習、於是祗能利用手工刀、能之乔刮削竹片、雕刻竹片、此外别無良法、故竹工之出品特多、但此等成績、用力雖多、收效甚微、我國欲謀敎育勞作化、勞作生產化、則對於設備上之缺憾、</p>
<p>亟應設法以補救之、</p>
<p>㈩㈠石刻印章、似爲美術品、不應歸入勞作科敎學、精製之器具模型、陳設模型、校舍模型、運動模型、（敎學設計上需要者除外）···出品中不在少數、雖略有勞作價値、但並無實用價値、以有用之材料、可貴之時間、消耗於此類工作上、殊覺不値、以甚費時間精力之刺繡、充作普通中學之敎材、（職業學校除外）與勞作之要旨、似亦不甚符合、縫紉僅注意於洋式單衣繡花沈墊、而忽略一般鞋帽及棉夾衣之普通縫法、殊未能適切平民化之日常生活、課程標準中敎學通則第六項之規定、希望敎材有組織、减少「割裂」「攙雜一一重複」等弊、而此次出品、十之八九仍是無組織之單獨物件、敎學方面、無聯絡研究之綫索可尋、製作方面、無練習設計之進程可覓、此種現象、亟應加以改進、以上各點、於勞作之設施及課程之推行上、均有重大關係、特提出之以供研究、</p>
<p>（十二）雕刻之筆筒及木板屏聯、全會塲中、爲數亦不少、論其工作、所費之時間與經濟均甚可觀、考其用途、實得不償失、究其價値、除訓練笨拙的死的做精神外、亦無其他可取之點、此類敎材、殊不適宜、如舉行第二次勞展、殊不願再見之、</p>
<p>（十三）用幾種彩色紙、剪貼成幾幅圖畫、本爲美術課程中之敎材、而本屆會塲、亦有以之充勞作成績者、此種設施、不特有背課程標準、且毫無勞作價値、徒使兒童之時間、耗費於漿糊紙張之間、故今後似宜禁止、此外以彩色洋綫、用單純之針法、刺成枕套抬單等大小物品、固較剪貼爲稍有價値、但如其物件細小、祗費兩三小時即可作成、且偶一爲之、原無不可、倘爲大件、需費整個學期之長時期工作以成之、則兒童之身心、爲呆板之工作所束縛、其害有不可勝言者、故亦似宜予以限制、</p>

<h3>點滴</h3>
<p>— （匡逮）</p>
<p>點滴這名詞是非常重要，不可忽略的；尤其在醫學上更當注意。前天據張醫士言：『我的醫院中有位病者，被刀傷了腹部，腸與腹膜也已漏在外面。經外科主任施了手術，將他送回原籍，同時把傷口縫好，使不再漏出。但因此人流血過多，其情况十分危險，所以用一種垂滴法，使那生理鹽水從靜脈一點一滴的入心，復流至動脈而運用全身的各組織，其功効爲補血以維持病者生命，也可以抵抗毒素。但此法要用得得當，每分鐘只限幾點或幾滴，過量則病者不但不得益處，反戕其生。』，如此這點滴在醫學可不是非常重要嗎？望吾國新醫界同志，對於這點滴加以注意，勿視人命如兒戲。</p>
<h3>收集家</h3>
<p>— 周賢</p>
<p>「收集家」，這名詞，在這勢口裏，風頭是挺健不過的。在前些年，只聽人說「集郵」，是怪有趣的。此外就不過是學校裏的學生，背起了採集箱，採集幾株植物，捉幾個昆蟲，檢幾片石屑，回到校裏去製作一些兒動植礦物的標本而已。别的似乎就没曾聽聞過甚麽。</p>
<p>但是這些年來，愛收集的就多了。就以我所認識的朋友而說，也很有幾位是很愛作很有系統的收集的。</p>
<p>一位是愛收集香烟殼的。他收集香烟殼的工作，還只有四年光景，但已收集得了三百七十餘種。他收集的方法，是每天上弄口的那家烟兌店去問可有新出品的香烟。若是有的，他便不管中外貴賤，購買一包。所以近來是烟兌店裏有了新出品，總是招他去買了。這位朋友，自已是不抽烟的，所以他買了烟，總是請人抽的，但他却有這一種奇特的興趣。</p>
<p>某君是假鈔票的收集家。據說已收集了十多年了，還没收集滿一百種。但是他收集的興趣，却十數年如一日，從没衰退過。他不拘遇到了誰，一見面，便問「這幾天可曾有假鈔票吃進」？若是報上一旦登了一則「破獲僞鈔機關」的消息，他便十分活躍的想去收一張新鮮花樣的。</p>
<p>還有一位是專愛收集中醫藥方的。他已集了二年了，家裏所藏的藥方，已有五六百張。（每醫一張）。他不拘到誰家裏，總得探聽可有人害過病。若是有的，他便跟着討藥方。他的收入與支出，本來是不怎麽寬裕的。但是他却每月總得花五六塊錢，去求不知名的中醫開藥方。爲了這一層，他的夫人，常駡他發神經病，常和他吵鬧，但他却依然的收集着。他說，再過三年，可以集滿一千位醫士的藥方了。</p>
<h3>野鴨獵話</h3>
<p>— 阿鴦</p>
<p>野鴨卽鳬之别稱，狀似鴨而能高飛，性喜合羣、常棲息湖澤中，故杜甫詩有『沙上鳬雛傍母眠』之句。毛羽甚美，雄者尤麗，故周紫芝詩有『花鳬趁綠波』之句；其體肥而多脂，肉供食品，味鮮可口，附體多絨毛，輕鬆温暖，可以製衣衾墊褥，爲禦寒之名貴物。</p>
<p>吾蘇洞庭湖，沙湖，陽澄湖等處，產野鴨甚多，每當冬季，或春冰初解時，有許多獵户，以打野鴨爲生，若輩所用之獵鎗，名獨眼鋶，每支重至百餘斤，出獵時，往往二人同行，備二舟，一大一小，先裝銃於小舟上；小舟復置於大舟上；如救生艇之附於大輪船上然，每値清晨或傍晚，將銃舟放入水中，隨臥一人，見湖邊水面，有野鴨成羣覓食，卽瞄凖發銃，一銃可得數十百羽不等。銃彈名曰鐵珠，製造鐵珠之方法；先將生鐵入爐溶化，同時備一木盆，滿盛冷水，中置南瓜或山芋等圓滑之物，鐵液取出後，卽對凖南瓜等澆下，一時液花四濺，入冷水後，則成鐵珠；製者手段頗有高低，高者粒粒珠圓，低者或橢或扁，不堪用也。鐵珠出水，必焙乾，以免生銹，價値每石約七八元，而生鐵每擔僅一二元，以上相較，其獲利之厚可知矣！</p>
<h3>新善乎</h3>
<h3>煤油箱</h3>
<p>— 顏波光</p>
<p>城廂的設備什麽都比較鄉鎭來得完全，像這兩天我們時常聽到傳報各處火警，漫漫長夜好夢正酣的時候，每每給瞭望臺上守警鐘的人幾聲警鐘驚醒，同時又聽得各區救火車聞警馳救的叮噹鈴聲。如果是距離稍近的話，就急急地披上了衣服，走到洋臺上向外探視，只見火光融融，火星向黑暗的天空飛迸，已成燎原之勢。啼哭跳嚷，也會遠遠地傳來，我心中有時會同小鹿般的頻頻而撞，就回身穿好衣服，㧞關而出，到災塲去作一回巡禮。</p>
<p>老的，少的，男的，女的，都偎身在搬出來的東西旁邊，珠淚紛紛，對着一片瓦礫塲呆呆的出神，眞是慘不忍覩呢！</p>
<p>可是鄉鎭地方，一遇到了火警，只聽到四處的煤油箱，敲得鎭天價響。嚴冬的季節，起身比較遲緩，十來個人扛了一具水龍，抬到火燒的地方，裝置龍頭咧，派入撳扛咧，派人提水咧，等到龍頭出水，早已成了灰燼，，至也坍倒了，或一燒竟延數十家！眞是吃了設備不週的虧。但是，每家人家的大門上，是必須掛一隻空煤油鐵箱，方能高枕無憂，這鐵箱倒有種妙用，第一可代替報火的警鐘，第二可防偷賊挖門，墮地驚醒主人。所以煤油箱在鄉鎭地方也得賣三角大洋一隻呢。</p>

<p>蔬菜爲佐饌必需之品，雖四時常有，而冬令尤佳；以其一經濃霜，味更肥美：不僅以適口見稱，而滋養天然，極合人體，尤爲難得；冬季蔬菜，以下列四種爲最著。</p>
<p>㈠白菜：白菜爲蔬菜中上品，是菘之變種，唐人所謂『闊葉吳菘是也』；其曰菘者，以凌冬不凋，四時常見，有松之操耳。白菜，原產於山東膠州，通稱膠菜；山東泥土鬆，天氣旱，原與本地水土不服，後經人工之種種培養而成，現在市上之叫賣者，大都本地出產；白菜之形狀：葉與柄皆扁闊，層層包裏極緊，全體成圓柱形，頂端似球形，葉微作淡黃色，秋末冬初，爲其出產初盛時代；一經濃霜，其質柔軟，味尤甘美；煮食可佐以魚，肉，蝦，蟹，魚生，煖鍋等，必用之品；如與開洋（海蝦米）同煮，曰金鈎白菜：用菜心嵌以千刀肉，層層包裹，縛以網繩，加鷄汁或南腿同煮，曰白菜幢；其湯之鮮，味之甘，不亞上珍，又有一種菜葉蓬鬆，外靑而内作嫩黃色者，產於浙西，味稍遜；，又瓣尖全作綠色，包裹不緊，作長圓形者，更非白菜之正種，其性甚粳，煮不易爛，味亦懸絶。</p>
<p>㈡盤科菜：以其塌地而生，故又稱塌科菜；其形如盆，平舗地上，高不盈寸，其菜紋甚縐，如摺疊式，色作深碧；一經濃霜，則味甘如餂，烹食最佳，他處所無有也。</p>
<p>㈢菠菜：原名菠稜菜，蔬菜中亦爲常用之品；原係西域頗陵國產，唐時其種始入中國；葉互生，略如三角形而尖，莖高約五寸餘，花小而黃綠，單性，雌雄異株，根作艶麗之赤色，時人戲呼之曰：『紅嘴綠鸚哥』：一經濃霜，其味更甘美，爲食魚生必佐之菜，故冬令銷售更廣。</p>
<p>㈣羅漢菜：又名遏藍菜，本年生，產於田野之濕地，莖不盈尺，葉作長橢圓形，網葉叢生，多至百餘瓣，葉脚抱莖；春夏之交，開小白花，結實圓而小，似團扇形。羅漢菜，向惟嘉定鄉間有之，本地原無此品，近亦盈筐市賣矣；採食以冬令最佳，經其開花結實之後，則莖葉粗老，不堪食矣；菜之氣味辛芳，儉歲人擷其莖葉醃之爲菹，雜靑果裝瓶，以貽遠客，其味芬芳甘美；有酒癖者，更珍之爲無上品云。</p>
<h3>另外一欄封神榜與五霸七雄傳</h3>
<p>— 恨水</p>
<p>近春秋欄，兩載烟橋村任先生，關於封神榜演義考證事，弟略有微見，敢以就正。中國所傳之章回小說，如水滸，三國，西遊，均有數度之演變，今日流行社會者，並非本來面目。封神爲舊傳四大奇書之一，不能例外。就現在所知而論，封神榜似發源於武王伐紂。然並不直接繼承之，其間尙有一部五霸七雄傳。此書弟有一部乾隆版，半已糢糊，唯大體可以辨識，其卷一若干則，（古章回小說，有分則不分回者，其詳他日當另論之）均記姜子牙佐周滅紂事，約二三萬言，未有封神之說也。書有陳眉公序，即令僞託，亦必同時所出，陳氏在明季，名士名氣甚大，清人則鄙笑之矣，不屑於僞託也。此書另有明版，圖甚佳，今藏北平大學研究院圖書館。書中稱明，均曰皇朝，其爲明著，非元著，亦證據確鑿無疑。或者，卽割武王伐紂書，冠諸此篇之首乎？弟未見武王伐紂書，未敢斷言。至封神榜著者，是否許仲琳，固有可疑，然至少係此人改編者，如金聖歎之於七十一回水滸然。誠如村任先生言，許名不刋卷首，而刋於卷二，弟收本亦如是，未知是何緣由矣。又此書中人物，與西遊記人物，有相同者，如哪咜，如楊戬，如慈航道人之與觀音，不一而足，仔細玩味，似各有淵源外，亦曾共取，書故事，另伸其說。弟閱明人戒菴漫筆，知西遊記有唱本，則明人之神話小說，今已湮没者必多，西遊封神之有另一所本，而業已失去，事乃可能也。今姑擬一西遊封神統系圖，願得高明之指正！</p>

<h3>御香縹緲錄</h3>
<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>一想起這些事情，伊還能有一些樂觀嗎？想到後來，伊的腦神經顯然是已被愁悶，痛苦，失望，憂鬱等等的影象全部包圍起來了，更無怪我們合宮的人，個個都戰戰兢兢，提心吊胆的忙竭力把自已約束着了！這一天上居然還給我抽出了一些空工夫來，我得了這機會，便忙着奔到那收藏着同治帝的遺物的古宮裏去；我的意思就是想看看前幾天太后親自帶去的一隻有自已會轉動的眼珠就和舌頭的小泥兎，有没有放還到原處來。我找了半嚮，却不見影踪，這當然是太后已把這一件同治的恩物用心收藏起來了；大致當我們不在伊跟前的時候，伊不免還要拿出來看看可撫摩撫摩咧！</p>
<p>這一天的工夫，也不知道是怎生消磨過去的，後來黑夜終於是到臨了；日間籠罩在這整個古宮中的一重憂鬱的空氣，至此便尤覺深沉濃厚了！天彷彿比往常壓低了許多，人的喘息也愈感費力。更有一件很凑巧的事，倒像是老天故意要恐嚇太后，使伊死心塌地的信服那兩個欽天監官員的預言：便是一陣陡然而起的北風，很猛烈地在宮外吹括着，怒吼着，搖撼得那些窗户也格格地響了。將到晚餐時候，我的服務時刻已滿，而我的精神和軀體也已同感疲乏，便辭别了太后，怱怱退出，先在我們的寢室前面的一條長廊裏倚欄憑眺着，打算吸一些清凉的空氣；不料那些紫色和白色的丁香花，給大風一吹，枝枝都在空中瘋狂似的曳蕩着，因此它們所有的那一股令人難聞的氣息，也越發覺得濃烈了，竟使我連帶的想起了死的氣息來！（二四二）</p>

<h3>標花跌勢加甚</h3>
<p>棉市趨弱、跌勢尤銳、因美印棉一致下落、匯兌步髭、金價愈跌、人心未免被其挫折、但通州帮及通濟公司之多頭、仍無舉動、故檯面未見十分衰落、不過紗花比價棉市太高、</p>
<p>（鄭標又跌三角半）　標花前市開盤、顯現不安之勢、因印美棉市一味下落、而金市步跌、紗市情形下良、據市塲上言、上海棉較上年增加、單就靈寳棉去年五萬餘件、現有七萬餘件、兩相比較、約增一萬多件、因之人心懈怠、賣風益濃、各月均跌一角半至二·三角、午後聞印棉暗又跌一·二·羅比、塲中人氣仍疲、各月又跌一角半、惟多頭仍不大量的吐出、查賣出明德一千一百擔、遠大一千八百擔、潤康六千二百擔、源興昌一千三百担、益豐六百擔、吉豐八百担、大豐一千二百担、長豐二千六百担、恒德八百担、買進源大四千八百担、愼昌一千九百擔、永昌四千一百擔、合興一千一百担、大福一千一百担、長和九百担、一日間最高低價及收盤價如下、</p>

<h3>津市紗花大體平穩</h3>

<h3>需要大呆下之美棉</h3>
<p>昨美棉開盤、市况平疲、價跌三至六磅音、交易平平、旋以外商抛賣、金候欵判决展期、商人失望、加之利物浦與孟買方面、均形疲軟、股市與小麥、亦形不振、市價益鬆、去路遲緩、不啻假前氣象、（按十二日爲林肯誕日美棉停市）紡織業呆滯異常、市價有名無實、收盤平穩、計現貨跌五磅音、期貨跌四至六磅音、英棉市况疲弱、計現貨跌三點、期貨跌一至三點、印棉初因多頭了結而疲、後以歐洲出口商買進而回、計平果爾跌四·五羅比、奥姆辣跌三羅比、白羅溪跌二·五羅比、原電錄左、（十一日電）</p>

<h3>糧食現銷帶好期粉</h3>
<p>昨日粉市、上午開盤後、各月份、呈初疲繼漲之象、以洋麥報價、芝加哥固跌三四角左右、坎拿大跌一角六七分左右、當開價時、以洋麥之報小、近遠期人心、曾略衝動、各月份小去半分左右、二盤後因實銷帮如天津營口帮、對現粉去路依然殷勤、頻有抽動、聞兩日内計成交十二三萬包、并以一小部廠家减車未開、似乎現粉需要、更覺堅勁、因此本月份疲而復振、遠期各月份、廠抛已减、惟恐洋麥之續定、買氣未挺、照目下情形、以現粉去路尙活、遠期則有洋麥之關係、將成倒掛之局面也、結果本月份好一分二厘半、三月份好七厘半、四五六月份未動、七月份好二厘半、</p>
<h3>期麥廠家無收進意</h3>
<p>昨期麥市面、上午開盤後、各月份復呈疲跌之象、以洋麥報價、芝加哥跌三四角不等、坎拿大跌一角六七分、至天時雖春寒甚烈、惟晴光大放、不致再見春雪、故開價時、各月份人心、均見虛弱、本月份因廠家無收貨之意、小勢較銳、遠期則交易不多、祗小一三分不等、迨下午開盤本月份因粉市銷塲甚活、帶好一二分、至遠期則因匯市逐長、現洋麥不昂、澳麥喊八角七分、阿麥喊六角左右、故人心仍平、結果本月份跌三分、三月份跌二分、四月份跌一分、現麥因廠胃不動、又無見交、</p>

<h3>河下米市到銷兩平</h3>
<p>（滬南）昨各帮來源、依舊寥落、共祗到十五六號、（貨共三千餘石）銷塲亦忽轉澥、大局似成兩平之格、各厚粳價悉無上落、晚稻雖靑島帮績有動動、然爲數僅三百餘包、亦無榮辱、杜洋尖仍見站定、陰變元、則定滯之局、</p>
<p>（滬北）昨河下各帮到船念一二號、市上胃口清懈、上中北粳價削小角外、嘉善早稻及小價北粳價短數分、杜尖客尖等價平定、其餘各價帶軟、高薄稻到貨稀少、去路活動、價昂一二角、</p>
<h3>洋客秈内地去路甚活</h3>
<p>閩省試辦湘紅米····客秈漲五六分</p>
<p>昨日洋米、内地去胃稍活、日前辦成者亦在絡續付裝中、市乃由疲轉定、開出西貢七千包、暹邏米一千五百包、江浙内地需要尙濃、後形似有步砌之必要、惟市上存底本足、邇日到頭不絶、昨日又有公司船達達鳥號進口二萬五千包、明後可有繼續抵申、故市面亦不易上升、惟客秈存到兩少、搬運不划、昨日浙路内地及南京與本街胃口均濃、目新有福州帮試辦湖南紅米一千包、南形更見　　、南京　内地　　　　　　　、價比前市步升五六分云、</p>
<h3>華南繼續暢辦豆餅</h3>
<p>豆餅自紅　以來、　　　　　　　　　　　頗健、市價已漲起五六分、昨市雖形回軟、但去路仍不弱、所以人心尙穩、統市計開各廠四牌現餅九萬餘片、價自一元五角至五角一分、訂三月十五號交三萬片、價爲一元五角零五釐、尙有輪運靑中餅成交一千零二十片、價爲一元五角七分、去路除靑中餅由行家辦進外、餘均爲廣帮汕頭等採去、</p>
<h3>糖市　太古糖降去二角</h3>
<p>｜新成立糖行一家｜</p>
<p>昨日糖市趨勢平平、公會劃盤、廣東粗砂白仍十七元七角、轉口貨五元、九號荷赤十三元四角、太古糖Ｂ嘜續小二角、爲十八元八角、本廠綿白原價未動、潮靑僅另星開出數百包、價爲十元半至九元六角、無上落、前傳之新組織糖行、茲已成立、牌號元亨、股東爲方玉剛、正資本爲二萬元、附本四萬元、經理柳琴軒、地址法租界洋行街、不日即可正式開張、</p>
<h3>廣帮糖號更改銀期</h3>
<p>改爲星期日付銀</p>
<p>廣帮號家、兼營枝干桂圓者、向分省城香港兩帮、所有來貨售於行家、其付欵期限、省帮爲一個月、例如本月一日至十五日所出之貨、須至下月十四五日付銀、十六日至月底出者、則於下月底付銀、港帮銀期較短、以星期日爲限、如本週一至週六所出之貨、至本週末即須付銀、今年省帮銀期於二月份起、一律亦照港帮爲例、逢星期日付銀、</p>
<h3>絲茶絲經交易節後</h3>
<p>匯票　　　外　　　　　低、而滬　人心依然堅挺、致絶少成交、白廠經市情、洋裝方面、聞有數家、絲電已轉、價碼相差亦微、諒爲時間未熟而未成交、國内用户、須挨過廢曆元宵節後、方有正式行市、昨日祗灰經七里等、略有交易云、</p>
<h3>疋頭呢羢店銷愈益擴展</h3>

<h3>五金點錫成交稀薄</h3>
<p>點錫新近交易、仍不興旺、市塲情形、依然暗淡、紹興帮因金融緊迫、胃口大呆、杭州天津生意亦不發動、市塲賴以點綴者、祗有一種雜錫生意、故開出之貨、爲數殊尠、行情因環境不良、所以亦外强而中乾、計小烘錫售一百七十八元、荷蘭錫一百九十八元、福足錫一百九十五元、正焊錫六十五元、副焊錫五十三元、斗錫一百九十元、比之紅盤祗有少許進出、</p>
<h3>東白鐵到湧滯銷</h3>
<p>東白鐵新近裝到十分湧旺、故在三菱大阪諸棧、裝到之貨、共有數十萬張之多、惟出路毫無、人心甚軟、是以市上標準、大有再跌之勢、</p>

<h3>追話舊歷年</h3>
<p>— 唐弢</p>
<p>元旦試了回筆以後，一擱就擱了一個多月，在這一個多月里，又看到不少文章，或者清算過去，或者希望來茲，總括一句說，是都爲新年而發的。</p>
<p>我也還想寫一點，也是關於新年的，這雖然已經狠遲，然而不管，横豎還有一個舊曆新年。</p>
<p>倘可彌補，則對於遲早，我們照例是不管的。陽曆新年里打麻將輸了錢，於是想：横豎還有一個新年。陽曆新年里拜貴客没有碰面，於是想：横豎還有一個新年。孩子領不到壓歲錢，夥計得不到休息，於是大家一齊想：横豎還有一個新年。</p>
<p>但所謂還有一個新年，也終於來到了。打牌，拜客，領錢，「白相」，自然又有一番熱鬧。然而拍賣，關店，縮小範圍，延長時間，支票不兌現；這熱鬧也終於落了空。</p>
<p>熱鬧一落了空，照例是要冷靜的，但在上海可不盡然。新年畢竟是小市民們「愛不忍釋」的東西，我們有殺牲口，接財神的市儈；有乘佳節，作雅集的書生；有釘著女人摜摜砲的英雄；有立在馬路邊拍手呌好的清客。跑狗塲，影戲院，酒館茶樓，街頭巷尾，買獨贏，猜五奎，鬧新年鑼鼓，「恭喜發財」！</p>
<p>上海，在這舊曆新年里，是熱鬧的。</p>
<p>鄉村的舊曆新年，留在我記意里的，也還一樣的熱鬧。</p>
<p>初一那天，東方還不曾發白的時候，就要起來祭天地，照例是三杯茶，四盆糕，四盆水果。叩頭旣畢，放了個開門砲，一年便這樣地開始了。接着是去拜年，先到家廟，次到宗祠，然後再拜在世的長輩。老老小小的面上都很高興。</p>
<p>他們高興，因爲他們還活着。這年頭的天災人禍，隨時都可以呌一個小百姓死。他們居然在這艱難困苦的人生道上，又挨過了一年，不但自已没有死，連别人也還活着，所以要互相道喜，希望這一年仍舊能够順流地過去，明年還有元旦，還得見面，還得互相道喜。</p>
<p>這樣一年一年地下去，縱然艱苦，在他們却還以爲幸福的。</p>
<p>元旦吃飯的時候，照例要用圓檯子，要全家圍在一處吃，意思是這樣才能博得一家的團圓。他們實在怕「流連」，怕「家破人亡」。</p>
<p>然而他們却偏有這樣的預感。</p>
<p>造成他們這預感的，是無數人的「流連」，無數人的「家破人亡」。</p>
<p>初二初三依舊是拜年的日子，親戚朋友們來來往往，閒叙心曲，互道好話，這實在是他們僅有的高興。一年四季里可以高興的日子雖然多，然而别人團拜慶祝的，未必便是他們所要慶祝的日子。只有這新年才是他們的。賭錢無須避官，偷閑不至挨駡，每一個人都覺得輕鬆，自由，放任。</p>
<p>新年特有的花樣，是船燈，馬燈，龍燈，和尙戲和打花鼓，鼕鼕鏜鏜，噯噯唷唷，這樣一直要鬧到月底。</p>
<p>鄉村的舊曆新年，留在我記憶里的，也是熱鬧的。</p>
<p>然而我的記憶却終於被打碎了。經過這一回的旱災以後，去年受兒孫拜年的長輩，已經不知死向何處；去年向父親拜年的兒子，已經不知賣向何處；只賸幾個餓㿜了的肚子，還在那里掙扎，呼號。</p>
<p>新年又到了，凄凉，寂寞，荒蕪，新年不再是他們的。天，誰能再裝一個笑臉？</p>
<h3>高空（二）</h3>
<p>— HenrlBarbusse著狄舟譯</p>
<p>｜｜繆塞的蒼白色的面龐上，與其說是銀白的不如說是金白的髯。多數的助手們，這時，面容凄蒼，放着細瘦的手在安樂椅的椅柄上的病人，彷彿在王座上面一樣。</p>
<p>富裕·有閑·誘蕩女人，一切只爲自已捧獻的他，不管他那高貴，銳敏的感受性，常常是最殘酷的野獸。又不管他那眞摯的精神，他是一個最說謊話的人。</p>
<p>現在，他覺悟到死了。用這至高的夜間的柔和的悒愁之聲，他，在咻咻喋喋着什麽事。就是這温暖的聲音，是給多數的心以苦惱的聲音啊。</p>
<p>｜｜我，滿足而幸福。他這麽說着。</p>
<p>｜｜我，什麽願望也没有。我，什麽也······</p>
<p>但是，他的眼睛正碰着一個立在那裏的女人的面龐了。他便把話收住。是一次也末見過的女人的面龐。是從親戚方面來的年靑的女人的面龐。這個面龐，顫着内心的感動，眺望着他。</p>
<p>慾望？是罷。或者是慾望的悔悟罷。這者是同樣的。慾望和悔悟，這兩個力量的衝突和交替之間，有不能切斷的鎖連結着在。現在，由他看來，一個新的有生命的東西出現了。對於這女人的熱戀的夢，又在他腐壞的肉體裏面，强烈强烈地燃燒了。但是，現在他没有法子觸一觸這女人的手。他，陷入無限的苦惱裏了。無限，那是沉到最深底的無限呵。并且，揭開這個夢的幕的釣絲，已落到他的棺木上面。已經停止怔忡的他的心臟，又悲傷，激動起來了。</p>
<p>不久之間，暫時過去了。像受傷的小鳥靜寂地掉下來一樣，很快地衰弱下去了。人們走後，只剩下和我兩人的時候，他，向我說。</p>
<p>｜｜我，從前，做了把財產給你的遺言。以後，大家都來强迫我寫别的遺言了。就在這抽屜裏面。拿去，把它燬了吧。只是，痛悔當初的遺言啊。</p>
<p>｜｜不行呵······</p>
<p>｜｜不行？</p>
<p>瀕於死的人，抬起大理石般的額，垂倒着的莊嚴的側面，用美麗的光輝的眼，不動地釘向我。像看到陌生的野獸那麽不動地注視我了。</p>
<p>｜｜遵從我的意願罷。不給那般東西的。給你的呵。</p>
<p>我不能再說「不行」，無力地垂下頭，身體動也不動。</p>
<p>時間過去了。人們又走進來。而時間已遲了。</p>
<p>······我對自已說了。咱所做的事是多麽糊塗呀。咱，毫不經心地走進寳山，而走過了却不往訪，並不是靠着貧乏的邊沿的我，却做了奪回財產的無益的事。多麽湖塗的事啊。</p>
<p>這樣，和廣大的空間的接觸，做成了我内心的第二個天性。而我的内心，却没有想繼續比那更進一步的這樣習慣的欲求。我，充分地侵略了世界的上層而過。顚倒觀察事物的舊的角度的習慣，奪我而去，渴望的蠢動呀，一切的惡呀，就連從强烈的利已心生出來的禮節呀，都從我的視野消失殆盡了。</p>
<p>他失掉理解力了。他的臉龐，微微地爲巨大的苦悶所撥着。······只有肉慾的敏感的他，幾次蘇醒來的他，他，是慢慢地慢慢地死去了。</p>
<h3>爸爸失業了</h3>
<p>— Ｈ</p>
<h3>讀「永勞永逸」有感</h3>
<p>— 先河</p>
<p>近來因爲自已正感着失業的恐慌，所以對於討論失業問題的文章，特别愛看。前幾天讀到本刋王平陵先生的「永勞永逸」，有點小感想，現在簡單地寫出，想王先生一定願意指敎的</p>
<p>這篇文章的中心思想，是把失業歸罪於「嚴重的錯誤」和「非分的徼倖」，而這「錯誤」和「徼倖」，照王先生的意思，就是「一勞永逸」的「觀念」。如果這邏輯没有錯誤，那失業羣衆的所以找不到職業，自然是只能自怨自艾。「你失業，是因爲你懶，能力不够，没有天才」，王先生正是這樣的意見。所以他提出「三問」，要失業羣衆反躬自省；究竟對這三個試題能否不交白卷。不交白卷的才有「試用」若干年月的希望，否則就只得請你上街白相。</p>
<p>可是事實是和這個理論完全相反的。試檢查一下失業隊伍，里面儘有才學兼全的分子；反之，在享受高祿厚俸的人們中，却也並不缺乏不學無術的低能兒。那些妄想一勞永逸的敗類，誠不足道，値得攻擊，但對「永勞」却不能「一逸」，或「永逸」却並未「一勞」的這種奇怪現象，王先生又該怎樣解釋呢？</p>
<p>王先生所舉的例子，是大學生。他說「有些人以爲祇許吃着一次苦，撈到一張文憑以後，便終身受用不盡了」，這當然是中肯之論，可是事實上却多的是莫說「終身」，就連「一朝一夕」也没有得到試用的大學生。對於「畢業卽失業」這個事實，王先生又能怎樣說明呢？</p>
<p>至於王先生所說的一年二年的能力，一年二年的生存權利，這種說法也未免失之抽象和玄秘吧？</p>
<p>我覺得如果糾正個把錯誤的觀念卽能解决失業問題的「一部分」，那王先生在那文章劈頭就說的「不知有多少組織是爲解决這個問題而設立，不知有多少政令是爲解决這個問題而更變，更不知有多少名流學者是爲解决這個問題而絞其腦汁」云云，簡直是不可思議的了。</p>
<p>其實王先生自已也承認這是一個「不易解决」的「社社問題」呀！</p>
<h3>鍾五（上）</h3>
<p>— 歐陽山</p>
<p>廣生發木棧底看棧人梁運已經是差不多五十歲年紀的人了。身體矮小，但是很健旺｜｜而且在這個狹窄的外包裏面，藏着一顆寬大而忠厚的心。没有兒女，年輕的時候娶過一個老婆，不到幾年就跑掉了，往後他獨身地，謹愼地盡着對他底職務應負的責任，而什麽欲望都不做地生活着。當他底老婆丢棄了他的時候，他還在欽州一間專門收集白鹿，金錢鷄，土麟鼠那一類野味的山貨店裏當伙計，知道這將成爲他一個不能塡補的恥辱了，就躱在一個黑房間裏悲哀地哭起來｜｜以後，他離開了那被荒山和大海合抱着的小城市，做着輪船上的火伕，魚棧裏的小鐵匠，一直到了廣州，永遠没提起他曾經有過一個女人。</p>
<p>他底性格是恬淡的，那程度恰好等於一塊擱在燒紅的炭盆裏的素瓦，能够烤熟一隻剝光了毛羽的雌雞，可是無論如何不會使牠本身燃燒起來。他有時捉到一匹野狗，秘密地把牠殺了，用許多醬料把牠底肉煮得在兩丈遠就聞到那股濃郁的香味，於是呌了許多朋友來吃，一面說他曾經爲這種食物花了多少多少錢，一面就高興地靜聽着那些人物對於這小小的謊話的反響｜｜讚美或者嘲駡。没有什麽善意和惡意的選擇，好像他永遠没有用他底意志去强迫過别人，而且自已的謊話也不包藏什麽野心。</p>
<p>被人打傷了肩膀，寄居在他底小木屋裏的「無主孤魂」鍾五，是一個魁梧，豪爽，而常常說着誇大的話，用能够侮弄警察，小商人和田主那樣的事體來驕傲自已的脚色。當他肩膀上的骨傷稍微好了一點兒的時候，就完全忘記了梁運底勸告了。他曾經叮囑他日間躱在小屋裏的木架床上，不要給存棧部理事查出有生人停留在木棧裏，但鍾五挺着胸膛四處跑，有時還站在栅門口喝駡那些搬運木材的小工，使别人在一個時候裏以爲他是新任的理事。</p>
<p>看見梁運踫到什麽人從遠遠的河岸吹着口哨走過來，就慌張起來的神情，鍾五說着這樣的話：</p>
<p>「那理事底名字是不是叫做金耀？｜｜是胖子胡壽告訴我的，那麽一個姓金的脚色會有什麽道理！他也許要把我僱用做存棧部底伙計｜｜至少，他應該知道碰到有人來偷木料的時候，就用得着我這種人。」或者用一隻手搓着被打傷了的肺部，狡黠地說：「這些人，連廣生發老板算在一起吧，並不是金眼白額虎，只不過是一些臭虫｜｜大量點，給牠們一顆血珠吧，永遠不會咬得死人的。去年有一次；我給一班契弟像圍獵那樣把我逼得没有法子，跳進一條涌裏，在水底走了半里路｜｜後來在田基路上晒太陽，無意中捉到一顆臭虫了｜｜牠好像換上了全新的衣服，咖啡色的，發出閃閃的玲瓏的光亮。我眞没有碰到過比這更好看的臭虫呢，馬上把牠當做一個患難朋友，心軟軟地愛着牠。把牠放在胳膊上面，要親眼看牠怎樣啜我底血｜｜牠那時候實在一點討厭的地方都没有，一點都不肯放肆，牠底温柔和順簡直把我打動得非常利害。我伸出一個指頭逗着牠玩，用輕輕的口氣把牠吹得四脚朝天，末了就替牠小心地在衣袋裏找了一個穩當的角落，把牠安置在那里。做完了這樣的事情，那天的受難幾乎都忘掉了，我底心反而輕爽得多呢！」</p>
<p>等到梁運縮起鼻子，一隻老猢猻似地笑起來了，他就加上說：</p>
<p>「所以，姓金的果眞來了，就讓我和他辦交涉｜｜他也許還記得我底口袋裏的味道的。」</p>
<p>梁運並不喜歡誇大的性格，但他能够容納牠。當鍾五說他自已在那些人物面前說話不會格裏格搭，而且要說得比他們更暢快豐富，反面使他們應付不來的時候，他總是深信不疑地點着頭，非常和靄地笑。</p>
<p>鍾五底靈魂是比他底身軀更魁梧的。他傲岸地踐踏過具有各種不同的顏色和氣味的土地，用强力使他周圍的東西向他低頭，而把他底牙齒對凖一切生物底最軟弱的部份。他不會使用那些必需的卑汚齷齪的詭計｜｜爲補償這個缺點，他不能不向一切人明說，他底殘暴的手爪是無情的。</p>
<p>他底品質還有一種善用詼諧的譬喻特點。</p>
<p>「你在寳安，東莞這幾縣地方轉來轉去，怎樣對人家說，你抱的是什麽宗旨呢？」</p>
<p>他們蹲在木堆旁邊晒太陽的時候，梁運會這樣問他。而他回答的時候，臉色顯得非常闊朗，好像這使他底心生出很大的感謝。</p>
<p>「要看什麽人。有時我說，」這不關你底事呢，老兄，」你看，世間就有這種人！把我踼到汚泥裏面去，没告訴我什麽道理；等到我在爛泥巴裏面爬着走，他們又來盤問了。你呢，你什麽話都不要對他們說！······」</p>
<p>「但是也有老實的人，眞是一個朋友那樣來問你的。」</p>
<p>「我就騙他。我說我有一個妹子，給人拐走了，我無論跑到什麽地方都得找着她才甘休。那麽大家都替我關心起來，有幾個人還因此和我做成好朋友。其實｜｜」</p>
<p>「你好像不會想到她的。」</p>
<p>「不，牠一定也高興見着我｜｜不過没有什麽理由能够叫我一定要去把她從什麽地方挖出來。這是用不着的。她應該自已去闖自已的世界，或者給人賣到新加坡，或者······總之，到處都是天空海闊的。」</p>
<p>鍾五這樣地在叙述着一些關於自已的不幸的遭遇，好像牠們只是一些虛張聲勢的恫嚇，被他察覺了的時候只能够使他好笑，更輕視地，更安心地。</p>

<p>眞的，近年來商業的不景氣，大有年不如年，江河日下之勢，並不是因爲倒閉了商店，方知市面的凋零，倒閉商店，僅僅表現商業一部份的破產，而尙有許多商店，欲閉不得，欲倒不能者，不知凡幾。惟推究近來商市所以不景氣的原因，便是我國整個經濟來源衰落的結果。</p>
<p>試觀近年以來，奢侈日增，農村破產，水旱凶荒，生產落後，外國資本主義的侵略和榨取，有此種種原因，人民幾無生存的餘地，各種企業，安有繁榮的希望，而滬上市面，表面似尙繁盛者，亦是我國全國經濟破產的反映，因爲内地種種情形的不景氣，全部經濟，都集中於都市，故此種都市的繁榮，實是外强中乾，曇花一現的景象，眞如水上浮萍，絶無根　。</p>
<p>就據滬上商業一端而言，號稱商業中心的大馬路，有某大菜館，平日營業，尙稱不惡，但據該館中人云，天天虧本，無法維持，余問其房租若干？答云三千五百兩，若再加以房捐及電炬等費，非四千兩以外不可，如此除資本利率不計外，每日房租等費，已非二百元不辦，所以每日營業，非做七八百元，不能開支，試問一家菜館，每日要做七八百元生意，在此不景氣情况之下，如何可能。</p>
<p>觀此一家，其餘可想無論各業貿易，不能發達，房金開支，無法維持，卽使營業狀况，差强人意，而收入所得，能有開支，能納房租，已屬幸事。惟在此營業狀况年壞一年的當兒，而地價則年高一年，房租則依舊昂貴，此種畸形的發展實足促進市面急激地潰敗，無論近年商情的不景氣，卽使景氣，也不過爲幾位房主地主做生意而已，所以近來各處建築高大市房，而十九無人顧問，原因所在，亦可推而知矣。</p>
<h3>失路以後</h3>
<p>— 默雁</p>
<p>「一朝天子一朝臣」，不圖事情的變化起得這樣的快！我們終於大家遇到了不可挽救的厄運。於是我們把我們的事業拱手讓人，作鳥獸般地散了！</p>
<p>我和老樓對於這一次失業，原感不到什麽過分的悲哀，因爲雞助的生活遲早總有捨棄的一日，但是當局的那樣處置｜植黨營私的處置｜｜與一班同事的無地容身，使人發生無限的忿懣和同情。</p>
<p>雖然時時嚷着要脫離那個鬼蜮的所在，但至此有家歸不得的時候，我不能不想到過去還是比今日好。現在更有什麽辦法呢？我將往何處去呢？我悵望着前途，不禁有托足無門之慨！</p>
<p>盲目地到都市去鑽了兩趟，結果使希望化成了死灰，擺在眼前的，祇有一條絶路！不知誰在播弄我，我眞想痛哭！怪只怪，自已一點也没有生活的技能和苦幹的耐性，當年楚霸王敗到烏江口還有一把利刃來結果自已的生命，這回我就連一件自殺的工具都難以找到，否則在心境惡劣時倒還可以隨手毁滅自身，省却無數次的焦躁和躊躇！</p>
<p>在逆旅中，老樓終於打算出一個無辦法中的辦法。經過了一番鄭重週詳的考慮，我覺得，如果這也算今後生活的保障的辦法，那末世界上簡直絶對不會有終日惶惶然喊着饑餓的人了。我體諒老樓之所以有此計劃，實出於安慰我和他自已的苦心，人家在鼓勵我撫惜我，我該有不同意的勇氣不近人情的拒絶嗎？這纔决定了我們的目標。</p>
<p>『得弄些錢到都市裏去，都市中有着我們的新希望，新生命，以及一切的一切』！這是老樓的計劃。</p>
<p>可是我到東到西没有碰到一椿順利方便而解决的問題，彷彿我所走的路程永遠是崎嶇險峻似的；平時間朋友們設法些錢，往往開口便得，算不得什麽，如今在需要殷切的當兒，却竟至一籌莫展！這最大的原因，自然要歸咎於這貧窮者所咒詛的年關。</p>
<p>人就弄得不像人形，整天奔跑，衣食住都破壞了常規。然而意外的仍徒勞跋涉，一無所得！歸納起來說，我們一樣的窮友朋，當然愛莫能助或心有餘力不足；稍稍富裕或略有居積的朋友，｜我没有鉅富的朋友，｜不是說近來經濟拮据，便是說年關到來周轉不靈。話是一句可以了結的：可恃緩急的朋友實在很少。</p>
<p>老樓的頭巾氣畢竟太重，他在相對無言的沉默中，突然口占了兩句，可是已深深地打動了我的心弦：「堪嘆世情淡于水，古今管鮑有幾人」！</p>
<p>最後我懷着失望的心情，奔到一位不好意思再向他開口的友人那裏。他那副富于同情的臉和極度誠摯的表情，直敎人感動得不忍啟口。他爲救濟朋友而窮而節衣縮食，我還能狠心的要求嗎？然而，朋友，令人五體投地的朋友喲！他窺察了我的來意，爲我轉作將伯之呼，托皇天之佑，設法到一筆足以濟事的欵子。惶愧之餘，居然如願以償，私衷不無快感，雖然還期是非常的迫近。</p>
<p>如魚得水，我掉轉了頭，回去告訴老樓這麽一個喜訊。</p>
<p>兩個人拊掌大笑了一陣，一同携着箱篋趕進了都市。</p>

<h3>一個胖子</h3>
<p>— 白舍</p>
<p>寒冷的黃昏</p>
<p>我爲着找一家澡堂走過很多冷落的街路。結果找到一個弄堂裏的什麽泉，一進門就有一股子廉價澡堂裏所特有的熱水氣冲進鼻孔裏來，在茶房的熱烈招攬之下，我終於走進了比這對面貴了七個銅板一位的暖客房，潤濕的不氣相當於偉大建築裏的暖氣設備，使得自已立刻便把外衣卸下，祗剩下在夏天所穿的一點衣服在身上。茶房跟我倒了一碗淡茶，我便拿出口袋裏帶着的報紙來看，在這片刻之間，我已忘了衣服的單薄與日间躑躅在街頭的寒戰，更抽起了一枝淡味的紙烟，似乎把自已手邊所能找得着的足以安心怡神的東西都找來了，縱使這裏是一個臭味的暖春，但畢竟是一個没有了寒冷的境界呢。正想抽完這枝味澹的烟，一件意外的事情却在這時發生了。</p>
<p>在茶房喊着「打手巾來」的聲音當中，我看見一個胖子就在我的旁邊坐下了，我因爲是靠在後邊，祗看見那胖子的背影，那胖子的後腦生出了兩條摺紋，誰都知道那不是凹陷，傳說一個人的腦袋計重九斤又八兩，可是在那個胖子講來，無疑是破了紀錄的。不過他的肩膀，其寬度却和平常人的相差無多，但愈到下部愈膨大了，我没有走進滿藏名畫的羅佛宮，不知道那裏的人體表現得有幾多重，但是我可是猜想得到，假如立體派的畫師來畫胖子的半身像，將會用一個圓錐來作成。不過那作爲圓錐的頂點的首腦，却是一個佛堂裏的木魚呢。茶房用了熱氣直冒的手巾跟他從背上擦到胸前，當到擦到胖子的下身，胖子便把身子仰倒了，我於是看見他的奶，奶峯高聳着，同生了孩子的婦人的奶一樣，能够從别處的肉上的震動的牽連而顫動起來，茶房替他用大毛巾裹起了脚，裹了一隻叉一隻，胖子一任其擺佈着，比到兩個孩子的身體還要粗胖的腿子息架在一個茶房的肩上，把胖子的肚上腿上小心地用毛巾覆蓋了之後，便有一個揑脚趾的人把他又粗又短的脚趾揑着，於是一種異常宏大的鼾聲便從胖子的鼻管裏發出了，把滿堂客人的視綫都吸引了過來，我眞耐不住這猪鼻子裏的叫　便到浴室裏去洗了。</p>
<p>在浴室裏停留了半點鐘，我的肺量再也抵不住水氣的壓迫，走回座位的時候，胖子依然睡得很熟，滿堂祗聽颼他的打鼾，這時他的一隻腿大抽縮着，下身的毛巾已經不知在什麽時候滑下去了，腿子的抽動劃入了我的坐位，我在他脚上打了一下仍然無用。於是我想起異國人給我們的「睡獅」的雅號了。同時我又想起了象，象是走獸中最大最肥硬的，但是他害怕鼻子裏爬進一隻小小的老鼠。</p>
<p>離開澡堂已近十點，胖子還睡着没有一絲動意，我不想再回顧他一下就走出來了。</p>
<h3>相隔一世紀（百樂門大飯店前所見）</h3>
<p>— 王云</p>
<h3>艒艒船中</h3>
<p>— 華之</p>
<p>續某年紀事</p>
<p>兵隊祇見闖來，没有退防，火車斷了後，這小鎭上彷彿被困的孤城一樣，雖然從那些灰老虫方面探聽得來的都是勝利的消息，但是風勢急的夜裏已經隱隱聽到隆隆的砲聲了。</p>
<p>城裏的商店都已歇業，鎭上田中的出產都賣給軍隊了，看情形前方戰事不是短時期内可以停止的，城裏城外一二萬人口的食糧問題是發生危險了，而况這末多地兵士的口食也要仰給於此？李媽日夜鬧着要回鄉下去，她的一個小包裏幾乎没有離開她手腕　時問。阿雲雖是無家可歸的，也每天深銷着眉頭的像怨恨我這個小主人爲什麽不早些設法跳出這個虎口。</p>
<p>三天以後，我知道困守不是辦法。不過合家人爲了父親的病都住在杭州，或者他們爲了戰爭的影響而搬走，不知他們是否要繞道歸家來一次。如果我一走，兩方面都不能通消息，大家躭心着對方也不是道理。這樣維持了一個星期。</p>
<p>本城的軍隊漸見騷亂了，前方失利是顯然的事實。阿雲去了一次城裏回來說，城裏人家都逃了，呌了民船從内河到了海去的，李媽就硬逼着我要動身。我一方成竭力寬慰他們，一方面也略事收拾預備必要時可以立卽起身。</p>
<p>父親那邊還是没有消息，而某一天黎明時車站方面起了密密的槍聲，說是有一排敵人偷渡過來。這緊張的捷報把我强自鎭定的心也搖動了，阿雲就沿城河一路搜尋船隻，但是被僱了逃出這虎口都没有回來，另一部份被軍隊扣住了裝運米糧，軍需等物，最後用了最高的代價把一艘没有人要的艒艒船租了來。</p>
<p>說起艒艒船，每天冬天總有成羣的一隊遠征到我們鎭上來，他們都是大江以北的居民，一艘船就是他們整個的財產，他們都能够作手藝，糖擔，花紙玩意兒，塑泥像，孩子們所喜歡的他們都有，這樣總要過了春天做一筆好賣買歸去。現在雖没有過春天，他們見風勢不對勁都提早走了。我們所僱的一艘，是老伙伴兩個，男的生了病，新年的賣買又被戰爭鬧去了，他們差一點幾乎出賣他們的財產。現在接到了這一筆好生意，夫妻兩個塗着哭臉來招待我們三個顧客，但當我們爬進了船艙的時候，一股霉臭的腥味令人作噁，李媽第一個没有好嘴臉叱着開船，對於他們殷勤的誠意是完全辜負了。</p>
<p>艒艒船後面是被泥土和竹篾堵塞了的，他們的衣食住佔了這一丈船身後部，兩個船家都站在船頭上，我們三個人還是盤膝佔了其餘的一半，船底又窄，稍稍舒一舒腿，他們就警告著船要翻身的。我們對着李媽一時從未裝過的嘴臉，心中笑着她也後悔不該草草出走嗎？</p>
<p>三個人綳緊了臉没有交談一句，這苦况祇有自家兒知道的。幸而順流，船很快地出了城河。兩岸靑靑的樹梢在船　口拂過，還有幾隻迎春的鳥兒啁啾着，才把三顆倒懸着的心臟弦緩了。</p>
<p>問了船家，知道到上海起碼要在這不能安膝的船上過二個夜，事到其間，就掏出捲烟來抽着，並且作爲這是一次奇特的旅行似的來賞觀四野的風景。</p>
<p>河身是率直的，這小舟蕩在河心就彷彿停在那裏似的，我想着如其在月夜眞可以浮三大白了。但是把目光放遠到兩旁連綿的阡陌，我的暢快的心不能那樣幻想了。那些農夫們到那裏去了啊？把翻起了泥塊的被太陽曬成龜背般的裂紋，春耕夏耘，世襲的種田人怎這樣荒懶呢？田旁的葇屋上也不見有嫋嫋的炊烟，一條瘦弱的野狗却並着我們的船走，不時投着飢荒的紅眼睛哩！</p>
<p>於是，我合了眼，隨這艒艒船把我一步步的遠離家鄉｜那我父親，祖父，二世辛苦積造起來的房舍啊！</p>
<h3>冬之晨</h3>
<p>— 吳飛</p>
<p>揉了揉惺松的眼睛，走上街頭，冷風吹過脖子，使我打了一個寒噤，街是靜寂寂的没有一些兒擾聲，雖然那糞車的輪子在奏送着天明的進行曲，然而都市裏的人們，却還在黑甜鄉中找尋他們的好夢，週遭的空氣，也好像跌入在無聲區里，連我自已的呼吸亦聽得很清楚。走上橋，我向空中長長地嘘了一口氣，一股霧樣的熱氣從嘴裏噴了出來，散在這空間。望望天空見灰黯得彷彿張了一層布幔在上面，雖有幾朶雲在徐徐地推動，但這動力是遲緩得比了逆風裏的帆船還要慢，幾乎使人看不出。</p>
<p>「多冷呵，冬天的早晨，這樣子是像快要下雪了吧！」不錯，那不是三九嚴寒了嗎？該是應當下雪的時候了！」</p>
<p>我這樣想着，儘管低着頭默默的向前走，脚趾頭在朝那一個方向前進，我却没有計較，整個意識已浸入在沉思裏面。</p>
<p>「天冷了！孩子身上的衣服已不够暖，你得去替他做一件棉衣來才好啊！」妻當我每次出門的時候，曾這樣喊我回去，叮囑我的幾句話，猛可的掩進了我的心頭。「對呀！孩子到現在還祗穿了一件破舊的薄衣，的確不够暖了，就是妻身土也僅穿了那麽」件六年前做的破絮襖怎樣能擋寒呢！總要想法替她們一人做一件新衣才好挨過遣個冬天；可是，可是錢呢？」</p>
<p>慢慢的走着，默默的想着，脚步是顯得十分沉重，而一顆心更似止水一般的　　着了。</p>
<p>天，終於漸漸地亮了，可是那冬日的太陽却依舊躱在雲翳裏，枝頭上的小鳥，已經給行人驚得噗嚓　的飛去了。　　我移着了個曳長的影了，不經意的闖進了公園裏，枯黃的草坪上堆了雪白的濃霜，草葉子給壓得重重的倒掛着。</p>
<p>「昨夜的霜濃得像雪一樣，怪不得睡不温暖了；何况那個破被絮，還是我們結婚時做的，現在已硬而且破，怎樣還會暖呢！看了霜，我又不禁想起了昨夜的冷，同時，也想起了要想替妻和孩子製一件新的棉衣，但是到那裏去拿錢來？我感到失望，我感到痛苦，「唉！一個男人！」</p>
<p>我再没有勇氣往下相了，但是我不想它，這思潮的漩渦越是趕不去，捲緊在我的心里。我走到河浜上，將一個肢體重重地投在一隻露天椅子裏，伸伸兩足，躺在上面，彷彿全身都癱軟了，没有一些兒氣力。</p>

<h3>日本汽車業現狀</h3>
<p>— 虞</p>
<p>｜出品運銷澳大利亞｜</p>
<p>日本雖是一個工業國家。可是重工業的發展。遠不及她的小工業。所以汽車工業之在日本。還是很糼稚的。日本國内的汽車。一大半來自歐美。本國的出產可說得是很微細的。政府當局和工業界。近年來對於汽車的製造。十分注意。因爲汽車雖然是一種普通的代步用品。和工商業有關係。可是在軍用運輸上。也佔着非常重要的地位。現在國際形勢如此險惡。遠東危機隱伏已深。世界上的强國都埋着頭擴張軍備。日人的注意汽車工業。自然也不是一件例外的事情哩。</p>
<p>據最近日本所出的汽車雜誌内稱。目下日本的汽車業大略如下。日本的汽車製造業和别種工業差不多。都有顯着的進步。關於汽車的製造。分爲兩點而言。一是汽車製造。一是零件製造。自從去年以來。大家渴望着的各汽車製造廠。都能實行工作。效率大增。報紙上登載新工廠的產生和舊工廠的擴展的。近幾個月來。也是不一而足。所以一般人。尤其是具有汽車製造知識的人。格外對於他的飛突猛進。大爲驚異。</p>
<p>日本汽車業的最足令人注意的就在他進步的神速。若然拿别樣的工業來比較。那没别種工業走一步。汽車製造業就要走十步。所以他的進步。不下十倍。或者有人要問。日本的汽車製造業。究經受着怎樣的激刺。而能如此猛進呢。這完全是由於國内和國外市塲的增進所致。因爲在從前。製作簡陋。銷行不暢。而現在呢。製造方法日進。就無怪他能不脛而走了。若干年前。一般人終以爲日人自製的東西。凡是需要確切的工藝技術的。終不能和外國貨相比較。後來經報紙的輿論。將這種成見打破。到了現在。果然自製的出品暢行國内。外人的東西竟無所施展其競爭了。</p>
<p>雖然環境上有許多窒碍的地方。日本的汽車出產。已經每年有增進。在最近的十個月中。國中供過於求。雖然各廠家都以全力製造。結果還是不够。在幾年以前外國的小型汽車市塲已爲日人所自製的出品追到。而各種汽車引擎呢，日製品的出口者。也一日多似一日。數量大爲增長。預料現在着手創造中的各廠家。一旦完成之後。日本汽車的出口當再有鉅大的進步哩。</p>
<p>日本汽車業的所以能如此發達。一方面固然是受製造技術的成功。和市塲銷路的開展所致。可是另一方面呢。在於汽車業本身。没有受着嚴重的。經濟衰落影響。近年以來。世界經濟的衰落。舉目咸是。雖然有人說。復興的現象已經到處吐露了。可是有誰能够說。究經繁榮能來與否。日本自然也受着這個經濟上的打擊。然而爲什麽汽車事業却能跳出這個圈子。而獨有滿足的長進呢。這自然是因爲祗有汽車業是新進少壯。富有朝氣和毅力，故能一日千里。</p>
<p>現在日本市上所見的。雖然都是些歐美各國的汽車。可是這個現象在不久的將來。將没有存在的餘地。目下日本的其他工業都能超越歐美之上。那没汽車事業自然也不會久居人下的。何况現在的汽車製造技術已經追及歐美。汽車市塲的擴展。當然是意中之事了。日本的汽車出品却是進步非凡。所以各種零件。不但銷行國内。就是海外也多歡迎而滿意。續漸的銷往世界各處。這種進步。是發生於短期間的。所以經濟衰落不能侵入汽車製造業中。日本的汽車現在已經銷往澳大利亞。零件底架裝運往美爾鉢缽地方裝配。並且經過代理行的各種試騐。</p>
<p>上面所說雖多是日人的口吻。容有言過其實的地方。不過我們看了之後。也可以曉得日人的刻苦努力。却是不可輕侮。巩怕再隔數年。她的汽車出品更要衆多哩。</p>
<h3>一九三五年福特廠的偉大計劃</h3>
<p>— 影呆</p>
<p>支出四萬一千五百萬美金</p>
<p>僱工人數增至八萬七千人</p>
<p>費去美金四一五，○○○，○○○元。僱用職工八七，○○○人。全年預備產車百萬或百萬輛以上。這便是福特廠一九三五年的大計劃。福特主廠的高級職員。工程師。統計專家。對於這偉大的計劃。曾經過幾星期的考慮。在產銷兩方。更有過嚴密的規劃。才决定在一九三五年度對於全美各地的汽車原料供應者六，○○八家商人。支出四一五，○○○，○○○元。在這鉅額的支出項下。單就密西根省一，七五七家供應者。他們都和地屈勞哀直接發生關係。自設工廠製造汽車材料的。預備支出三○○，○○○，○○○元。這個大量生產的計劃。實行而後。福特廠方面。每月的支出。單在地屈勞哀。當有六，八六一，○○○元呢。</p>
<p>關於他的事業。最近有人和福特討論過。他這樣的說。「就福特廠看來。不景氣象似乎已過去了」。「在我們所經騐的看來。過去六個月中」。他說「事實告訴我們。未來的一年之中。事業已可進展了」。「那麽在你以爲不景氣已全部過去了嗎」。有人問福特。「爲什麽。不景氣象在全美國。不久將過去了」。他答道「假如美國的實業界。把「不景氣」這個字母的拼音完全忘却了。依舊把美國人所獨有的那種健全良好的經商精神去努力的促進他們的事業。那麽他們便可控制全個美國。同樣。更可使全美的人民。應用他們健全良好的常識。</p>
<p>汽車事業的促進。無疑。又可僱用很多的失業工人。而據福特廠方面的報告。在過去一年之中。地屈勞哀的在城和近郊各處。早已有甚多工人。守候廠方的添僱。且在最近的幾月之中。所僱的職工。最多的時候。到達過五五，○○○人。眼前雖然因爲内部在整頓和計劃。僱的人數是减少了。担一待復興計劃的着手進行。便立刻要添僱工人。將來添工的時候。廠方更已决定先儘量僱用福特廠的老工友和其他地屈勞哀各廠的熟手工人。就事前所計劃的。假如未來一年。預備產車總數。達百萬輛以上。那麽至少將僱工八七，○○○人。</p>
<p>在這巨額的支出中。照事前所預定的。其中原料的購入。直接用車輛運入者。有一六四，○○○車。由海外購入。到了美國。再用車輛裝運的一六○，○○○車。單就運費一項。大部份是鐵路方面的運費。已有七四，○○○，○○○元。福特一九三五年預算表上，支出項下。最大的一項。便是車身的購入。將有一○○，○○○，○○○元。這一項支出。差不多完全因購進車身而交付於地屈勞哀整個區域中的車身製造廠的。</p>
<p>此外支出方面。佔巨大的一項者。便是鋼鐵和非鐵質金屬的購入，三項總共有七五，○○○，○○○元。其中福特自已的鋼廠。供應不足。而向公開市塲方面購進的鋼。佔五三，六○○，○○○元。有展性的生鐵六，六一八，○○○元。白鐵二，六八三，○○○元。（在羅傑河濱所產的還不計在内）。非鐵質金屬一項。最多便是鋁。佔六，○○○，○○○元，此外靑銅三，六○○，○○○元。鉛一，四四三，○○○元。錫一，一五一，○○○元。亞鉛三三七，七五○元。</p>
<p>橡皮事業。的確受惠於福特廠不少。因爲在福特一九三五年的預算表上。橡皮胎的購入。有二二，五○○，○○○元。而粗橡皮有六，○○○，○○○元之多。其他的原料。用以裝配車身的。預計也須支出三二，○○○，○○○元。其中車座上應用的托布。毛毯。皮革。和其他車身上縫補用的材料。總共三六，七二七，○○○元。玻璃一一，○○○，○○○元。漆四，三○○，○○○元。木材的購進。連同行李箱裝運包套等等三，○○○，○○○元。在預算表上。支出項下。最重要的一種，便是使福特。現在鍊鋼廠的擴大和動力的增加。新廠一所。需欵一四，○○○，○○○元。另外福特廠的機器。器物。和各種物件的購置。需支出二，五○○，○○○元。加上燃料和不生產的人工｜像機器的移動。門窗的洗擦等等｜使一九三五年的預算表上。支出四一五，○○○，○○○元。</p>

<h3>汽車製造中新出之各種生鐵合金</h3>
<p>— 冗林</p>
<p>近年來汽車製造之進步。突飛猛進。而其應用材料之革新。亦頗可觀。卽如生鐵合金一料。其抵抗融銹。增强力能。均較鋼料爲優。而成本則廉賤多多。合金中攙雜之各種物料。以鎳爲最多。其能使鐵質各部成份調和。不存堅粒。不致因厚薄不匀而肇禍。且散熱極易。利益更大。其它則鉻鋼釩　　砂等物均有參入。各有利用。</p>
<p>通常充作汽缸材料用者。其生鐵合金中所加物料爲鎳百分之一丨一·五。鉻百分之○·三丨○·五。矽百分之一·五。此種成份。在求得與鋼鐵同等機械力時。其體重可减輕百份之十五左右。</p>
<p>掣動桿用生鐵合金。可加入鎳百分之二·五丨三·○。砂百分之一·五丨一·八。鉻百分之○·四丨○·六。鐵百分之一·○。及碳百分之二·八。量則較能更增阻力。可使高速度駛車。突然煞止。决無危險。</p>
<p>在美國後車軸及傳動軸。亦多以新合金充任。可得較强之耐彎耐壓力。用於後車軸者其成份爲鎳百分之三丨四。矽百分之一·五。碳百分之二·五。用於傳動軸者其成份爲鎳百分之一·一。鎂百分之○·三丨○三·五。矽百分之一·八丨二·○。鉻百分之○·三丨○·二五。碳百分之三。</p>
<p>活塞所需之材料。本多以鋁鐵合金充之。然以其阻力過大。體質過重。積熱難散。故難滿意。亦有用銅鉻鐵相合者。則以澎漲性能過劇。不甚合宜。現在進步所得。活塞用合金。鐵中加鎳百分之一·○丨二·○。百分之三·五。砂百分之三·○。而活門用者則加鎳百分之三·八。鉻百分之○。八。碳百分之一·○。碳百分之三·○。矽百分之一·五。於是乃能得高强之機械效率。而積熱亦極易疏散。</p>
<p>此外復有釩○·六鉻一·五碳○·二五成份者。具有八五○丨九○○Vickes之硬度。而鉻一八·○鎳八·○者可受熱至華氏一○○○丨一五○○度合而毫無伸縮現象。斯則均爲現代生鐵合金中進步之一班也。</p>

<h3>汽車的新燃料</h3>
<p>— 瑤</p>
<p>美國汽車工程師學會紐約分會。在本年九月集會時。預測在不久的將來。流綫形汽車必將風行各處。而且牠的速度一定可以打破現在新式流綫火車的紀錄。</p>
<p>這種高速度汽車所用的冷却物。卽是引擎的燃料丨丨丁烷和丙烷。（ButanePropaneGas）據說用了這種新的燃料。壓縮率比現在用汽油的提高一倍。燃料的重量也可减輕百分之二十。</p>
<p>按丁烷及丙烷。以前曾用於引擎去熱。現在同時把牠作燃料。這樣可使引擎的去熱量及燃料消耗的引擎速度成正比例。所以最爲適宜。並且這種方法並不佔去地位。更不增加重量。駛行時也毫無困難。</p>
<p>普通用汽油的引擎的壓縮率。大槪在五比一左右。如用丙烷。壓縮率可提高至十比一。如用丁烷。可提高至七比一。</p>
<p>當這種燃料通至化油器時。因爲先前吸收了引擎熱力。所以差不多已成氣體。極容易和空氣混和。這樣在汽缸裏燃燒可以更完全。油的消耗可以减少。炭屑的產生也可消除。</p>
<p>這二種新燃料都是提煉火油的副產品。價錢和普通汽油所差無幾。因爲極易蒸發。運輸比較困難。所以祇適合於商業用途。</p>
<p>普通汽油汽車的引擎。祗要稍加改革。卽可改用這種新燃料。</p>

<h3>英國名小說家許·華爾坡在好萊塢（下）</h3>
<p>— 黃天始</p>
<p>在「塊肉餘生述」中，他盡量採用迭更斯原著的台詞。影片中祗有一個塲面和小說兩樣的：他把大衛和都拉相會於戲院之内，而不在大衛的父親的寫字間之内。大衛父早死。晚父關係已絶。此處疑有誤。待查原小說。編者註。</p>
<p>「我相信該影片是一件十分能幹的工作。」華爾坡報告說。</p>
<p>關於却利賴甫頓退出該片的謠言，是否眞確的呢？他是否已放棄飾演密考伯（Micawtr）因爲他「憎惡迭列斯」呢？</p>
<p>「是的，眞的有過這一回事。」就是華爾坡的答覆。「他原先不想接受該角色的，後來因爲我的勸告纔答應下來。我當初以爲他可以大顯身手。但他並不宜於滑稽角色，他自已很明瞭的。他眞的憎惡迭更斯的作品，認爲太兒戲的太淺薄。」</p>
<p>華爾坡第一次現身銀幕的感想如何？</p>
<p>「他們請我飾演Vicat。牠是一個微末的角色。他們一天内就把我的戲拍完。劇情叙述我在敎堂中佈道時，大衛在座中睡着了。有人散佈消息說我在水銀燈下十分慌張。這是不確的。我覺得澈底的快意。電影上的演技比較舞台上的演技容易得多；你不會忘記你的台詞或失掉你的自主能力的。</p>
<p>「我希望在不外的將來我們在家庭之内可以設立一個電影室，如圖畫室一般。」他說。「有許多偉大的電影我們極願意保藏及重看的，像「民族之誔生」，「塊肉餘生述」，「小婦人」等。自然祇有若干作品是有不朽的價値，但我們的電影室可以儲藏着一百張影片，並可以計畫一種較簡單的有聲放映機。如果電影眞正有永遠存在的價値，我敢保證這一類的發展是不可缺少的。然後自然將有更多的製作人致力於有永久價値的影片的攝製。」</p>
<p>華爾坡預備立卽回返英倫，待至本年七月再次蒞臨好萊塢，繼續製片工作。有人問他是否想寫作原著電影劇本，他的答覆就是「不！」</p>
<p>「最好的辦法還是把别人的故事改編電影劇本。」他答道。「你就用不着顧累你的故事會給一位製作人分裂了，並完全改變了原來的意義。至於我動手寫作原著電影劇本之前，我先要獲得相當的保證，保證牠能依照我的理想實現。如果製作人能提出這種的保證，則作家們像蕭伯納，威爾斯等對於給電影寫故事的問題，就可以用不着踟蹰了。</p>
<p>「我相信作家在電影製作上將佔據更重要的地位；一方面，一個作家也要明瞭他是需要和製作人，導演人及佈景人在營業上合作的。最重要的是要各方面互相信任。許多影片因爲工作人員不融洽而失敗的。各個原子必要絕對的和諧；這不是說我們要整個的服從；我們對於「塊肉餘生述」曾有劇烈的爭論，但每人都互相尊重别人的意見。祗有這一個方法纔可以希望製成一張完善的影片。」（未完）</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3>評「爲郎辛勞」</h3>
<p>— 尤兢</p>
<p>CheatingOheaters大上海映</p>
<p>這又是一張强調着男女懸愛關係的偵探片。</p>
<p>也許是因爲從舞台劇改編的關係，在許多没有結搆，没有情節的偵探影片中間，這「爲郎辛勞」要算是比較好的一張了。</p>
<p>關於原作者MaxMarcin，我媿於不甚熟悉，這兒不便多說什麽話。只是從這透過了鏡頭，在銀幕上所顯示給我們的看起來，覺得這被譯作「爲郎辛勞」的CheatingCheaters稱之爲GreatatFamousStagePlay却未免過甚其詞的。</p>
<p>情節的開始是從巴黎到紐約的輪船上起的。勃羅克登的女兒嫩小姐，一見生情地愛上了同船的少年湯姆。抵埠後賃屋和他做了鄰居。</p>
<p>這兩家人同時顯着不大正派，在鬼頭鬼腦地相互誇耀富有，又相互用心地在偵察財富之所在。</p>
<p>勃氏請湯姆全家來吃飯，他把同夥者扮成僕從及嫩小姐的音樂敎授等。盛筵方散時，僕人送個空白電報來僞說老夫婦和僕從得往芝加哥去了趟。嫩小姐爲學音樂就被留在湯姆家中住着，花前月下，旣加深了兩人的愛情，而飯餘酒第的閒情中，也顯露了兩家的財產與秘密的收藏所。戲劇在這瞹昧的氣象中，鈎心鬥角地進行着。劇作者與導演處理這些綫索是相當細膩而又簡潔得可取的。</p>
<p>劇情展開在兩家的相互偷竊中，湯姆父子因偷却勃家被他們所綁；而勃家同樣被厄於湯姆家保險庫的電流上。嫩小姐密召警士來，把兩家七八個人全擒起來，兩家的財寳也早爲她當賊贓没收去了。這時劇作者才告訴觀衆們說嫩小姐原來是名偵探愛麗絲，她爲了愛湯姆纔他裝盜女來弄出這些糾紛的。於是她購了丈夫又破了同時的兩椿案子。</p>
<p>由於劇作者的努力，把這曲折的情節織接得相當巧妙的。本文上面所稱比之一般没有結搆與情節的偵探片較好的，就是指此。自然，這兒的所謂好，不只是有意義而已。我們所要求的有意義的東西，决不是徒有離奇的情節與精密結搆，而脫離了實生活之反映與指示的作品。</p>
<p>導演RichatdThorpe的手法没有出衆的地方。前半部的處理尙有可取，後半部簡直顯着慌張，忙亂，精神灌注不到每個劇中人。只是在嫩與湯姆初認識時·後者燃着火石來照她臂上的飾物，以寫出他的盜性，這點頗爲深刻的，在嫩的表現中導演也用了相當多的小聰明。在斯梯夫與湯妮的性格與動作上，所有的出點趣味也頗好，</p>
<p>電影劇的編者除了幾處伏綫的設置尙算不惡外，似乎不能電影藝術的地來處理這舞台劇本，如不在勃家請客，巴氏客廳中這些接觸到較多人數的塲合。都顯着舞台味兒。至於從案子展開到警署中的多人的塲合，簡直受着很深的舞台面型的限制了。自然這是導演者也要負責的。倒是湯妮在巴家敎嫩小姐彈琴同時商量做賊這塲戲受了舞台劇之帮助的。</p>
<p>演員在主FayWray始終很努力，一顰一笑中寓着深沉與嚴肅，很有偵探女之味兒的，只是潑辣的力量還稍嫌不足。其餘的都平均地有着戲做，也都平穩地過得去。</p>
<h3>胡萍會造摧淚彈</h3>
<p>— 靑雲</p>
<p>在史東山導演的有聲對白歌唱片「人之初」裏，胡萍是飾魏鶴齡的「女人」，也就是一個船娘。因爲他們是靠着每天用船送渡客人過河爲生計的。</p>
<p>當胡萍生了第二個男孩子時，因爲家裏貧窮，不能養活小孩子，只得忍痛的把孩子送給了有錢没有孩子的黃太太去扶養，當黃太太派人來領取孩子時，胡萍眼睜睜見了親生的孩子被大家抱了去，不禁牴犢情深的哭了。昨天」人之初」便是拍這一幕戲。</p>
<p>這一幕戲拍完了之後，史東山因爲她表演得非常逼眞，所以很嘉讚他，又有人問她表演哭時的眼淚，怎麽會流得那麽的多？她笑而不答，大胖子陳麟書挿舌曰：「你不知道嗎，她會造摧淚彈啊」！（却酬）</p>
<p>觀衆意見</p>
<h3>觀「紅羊豪俠傳」後</h3>
<p>— 萬里</p>
<p>在這舊曆新年，各戲院爭映新片，五花八門，花團錦簇，這給予我們影迷們多大的眼福啊！我前天也曾隨着擁擠的觀衆，前往卡爾登，看「紅羊豪俠傳」。</p>
<p>「紅羊豪俠傳」開始，便現着玉闕丹墀，彼九五之尊，受着百官覲見的朝賀。這一幕很偉大，表暴過去的曆史，色采充分極了。接着洪秀全和馮雲山便在銀幕上和觀衆相見，洪由田方飾，馮由嚴影飾，英俊立氣，溢於眉宇，若云人選，適當之至。洪馮兩人馳馬村野，以大自然爲背景，畫面美秀異常，大有「金勒馬嘶芳草地」的詩境。</p>
<p>童月娟飾歌女，在村店賣唱，唱落花飛絮曲，農村破產，黎庶流離，盡在歌聲嚦嚦中傾吐而出，悽愴悲哀，一字一淚，任作鐵石心腸的聽了也要大爲感動哩！</p>
<p>一般人都以爲王虎辰受着京劇的洗禮，熏陶在功架姿態之中，一旦上了銀幕，難免帶着幾分京劇色采。不料事有出於意料之外者，他在此片中飾韋昌輝，表情恰到好處，和舞台上所見的王虎辰截然爲兩人，這是王虎辰的處女作，也可說是成功作。</p>

<h3>塊肉餘生（Ｄavid　Copperfleld）（七）</h3>
<p>— 柳村</p>
<p>但是有一次，大衛的姑母和密司脫狄克來到大衛家裏吃夜飯，一切家政的紊亂，就立即呈現無遺那天廚子喝酒喝醉了，蛤蜊没有劃開，開蛤蜊的小刀亦找不得，一隻羊腿半邊没有烘熟，半邊還是生的。這種情形，顯見得大衛的娶都拉是一件錯誤的事，後來大衛就設法，重新將忠實的壁各德請了來，照料都拉以及管理家務。但是自始至終，内助二字却談不到。都拉至多能做得勝任愉快的事，就是在大衛寫字的字候，她把筆尖浸在墨水缸裏，沾些墨水而已。</p>
<p>不過大衛的愛，是始終不變的。他繼續地愛着她，如同她是他的兒女似的。一年一年地過去，他對於都拉的温柔體貼，却一些没有减少。有一天晚上，都拉病了。那天晚上，老漁亦尋着了大衛，告訴他愛密柳已經被他尋到了。老漁雖然心還想復仇，但却感謝上蒼愛密柳能被他尋回來。他並且告訴大衛，愛密柳在尼泊爾司被司蒂爾福司遺棄了。司蒂爾福司臨行之前，並且告訴他的僕人，呌他納愛密柳爲妻。</p>
<p>愛密柳自悲身世，遇人不淑，以致被人留作奴僕輩之用，就想一死了之。司蒂爾福司的僕人，將她鎖在一間空房之内。不過她終究設法逃了出來。老漁設法將她尋到了。愛密柳看了老漁，就匍匐在他的脚下，求他饒恕。老漁的愛，終究是偉大的。他將愛密柳樓抱在他的心頭，兩行老淚不覺就漱漱不止地流了下來。</p>
<p>愛密柳雖然已經覓到，但是老漁却又愁着一捲事。他聽說漢姆自從失去了愛密柳之後，就不顧自已的生命，遇見海上發生風浪，船翻人溺的時候，他總是爭先恐後的，第一個躍入海中，從事於救溺的工作。因此，老漁請大衛光趕到鴉墨司，去告訴漢姆，說愛密柳已經尋到了，勸他以後不必再將自已的生命作孤注之一擲了。</p>
<p>大衛到鴉墨司的時候，他遠遠看見海邊上，聚了一大堆的人，大家都神色倉皇地談論着一件事。在海上浮着一隻破碎的航海大船，船上站着一個人爲生命而掙扎着。大衛遠遠望見衆人拖住了漢姆，但是漢姆將大衆擺脫了，大聲喊着：「無論誰，凡是要溺死的，我就要去救。」大衛向前狂奔着，但是他還没有到海邊上，漢姆已經向着波濤洶湧，狂風怒號的海水中，縱身躍了下去，很命地仲長了兩臂，左右攀擊着急流，向着目的物前進。</p>
<p>漢姆一下子一下子，泳近了那在水中掙扎的人，但是每進一步，又被浪激回了一步。大衛在岸上大聲喊着，但是漢姆已經聽不見了。他和波濤鬥爭着。他超過了一個浪頭，又一個浪頭，最後那他所要救的那個人的面貌，漸漸隱約可見了。他仔細看着丨原來就是司蒂爾福司。漢姆狂喊了一聲，好似看見了什麽魔鬼似的。他高高的舉頭拳頭，作欲擊之狀。正在這個當兒，忽然一個大浪，像一座靑山似的，排山倒海而來，那條破碎的船，忽然轟然一聲崩裂了，沉在浪底下去了。跟着司蒂爾福爾和漢姆亦都捲進了漩渦，不知去向了，海面上似乎較以前平靜得多了，那裏祗浮着幾塊碎木片，好像方才被擊破的，不過是一個小木匣，又好像大海呑没了許多東西，和兩個人，已經消了怒氣而不再逞其狂暴了。（未完）</p>

<h3>British Legislative Council Discusses Hong Kong Stock Exchange Issues</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) This morning, the government issued a white paper stating that Legislative Council member Braga will raise the issue of trading in commodity exchanges by commercial firms not residing in Hong Kong when the next Legislative Council convenes. Mr. Braga intends to question whether the government failed to prevent the establishment of commodity exchanges several years ago and whether the Colonial Financial Secretary knew that Hong Kong had organizations of an exchange nature, with local transactions telegraphed to foreign exchanges to trade in commodities such as wheat, cotton, and rubber. The Financial Secretary was also asked whether he knew if the traded commodities were actually delivered in full or in part according to the orders. Mr. Braga's questioning is an attack on the authorities' permission for brokerage firms not residing in Hong Kong to engage in the commodity trading business in Hong Kong. However, the brokers do not pay attention to Mr. Braga's remarks about gambling on commodities and believe that the government seems unlikely to implement any prohibitive measures.

<h3>Loan Conditions of Various Banks in Beijing</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) It has recently been rumored that banks in Beijing have received a notice from the Shanghai head office regarding mortgage loans for immovable property, stating that they will temporarily cease to operate this business. In fact, this is not universal. According to a bank source, the situation of real estate mortgages in Beijing is that in the past, banks in Beijing operated housing mortgages in a prudent manner, which was not the main part of their business. To meet social needs, they carefully issued loans based on collateral and guarantees to provide turnover for all sectors. According to the regulations of the Ministry of Finance, commercial banks are not allowed to exclusively engage in housing mortgages, but they are allowed to concurrently operate property mortgages under the savings department of the savings section, with a maximum limit of six years to pay off principal and interest. The mortgage amount is generally 30% of the original value, with a monthly interest rate of about 1.2%, which is a very prudent investment and should not cause problems. (Special dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The person in charge of Jin City Bank said that last year the Shanghai money market was extremely tight, and occasionally one or two banks tightened their lending, which was expected. However, there have been no such rumors in Beijing. According to the Beijing Bankers Association, the scope of real estate mortgages is also wider. The rumor that various banks have received a notice from the Shanghai head office to suspend this type of mortgage is not true. An investigation shows that most real estate mortgages in Beijing are for housing, and pure land without buildings is rarely accepted due to its lack of production, unless there is a special and reliable guarantee. In short, in a sluggish market, banks primarily focus on ensuring clear guarantees when accepting collateral and do not reject all mortgages. (Special dispatch, 12th)</p>

<h3>Lord Lytton Visits White House to Discuss Far East Situation</h3>
<p>Secret Talks with Ambassador Shi Prior to Visit</p>
<p>Anglo-American Cooperation is Sincere</p>
<p>Will Jointly Request Japan to Restrain Aggression</p>
<p>(Washington) Sir Victor Bulwer-Lytton held successive meetings today with President Roosevelt and senior American officials to discuss in detail the general situation in China and the Far East. Prior to his talks with President Roosevelt, Lytton held secret talks with Chinese Ambassador to the United States Shi Zhaoji for several hours. Detailed information about Lytton's meeting with the president was not released, but it is generally believed that all Anglo-American policies in the Far East were studied. Government observers said that the main feature of the meeting was probably to discuss how to maintain peace in the Far East. It is said that Lytton suggested that the United States and other countries jointly request Japan to restrain its aggression to avoid causing war. According to Lytton, he believes that Britain and the United States can cooperate to maintain peace in the Pacific, and this agency's news yesterday also stated that Washington officials largely agreed with this idea, but American policy has not been formally announced. According to predictions here, Lytton and President Roosevelt discussed the entire issue, but did not mention the point of signing a treaty, because although Britain and the United States have ways to cooperate, it must be a tacit understanding. Lytton also met today with Secretary of State Hull, Deputy Secretary of State Phillips, and Far East Director Hornbeck. (Guomin Electric, 11th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Lord Lytton is traveling in the United States, lecturing, and this afternoon President Roosevelt held a tea party to entertain him.

<h3>Hirota Actively Pursues Diplomacy with China and Russia</h3>
<p>Seeks Economic Development with China</p>
<p>Eases Tensions with Russia</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Foreign Minister Hirota is formulating diplomatic strategies for the major current situation, aiming to actively adjust Sino-Japanese and Japanese-Russian relations in parallel with arms reduction countermeasures. He is currently preparing with the determination to personally take action. The reasons why Foreign Minister Hirota strongly advocates adjusting Sino-Japanese relations are as follows: 1. At the London Disarmament Preparatory Conference, Japan's proposals are far from those of Britain and the United States, making it difficult to approach. 2. The reason why Britain and the United States do not recognize Japan's request for equality is that they fear Japan's development toward China, Outer Mongolia, and Siberia. 3. Britain and the United States hope that Japan will clarify its attitude and dispel this concern. Therefore, although Foreign Minister Hirota will not hold an arms reduction broadcast after the return of the Japanese arms reduction representative, in order to stimulate the emotions of various countries,</p>
<p>China Policy - The Foreign Minister's attitude and policy toward China are as follows: 1. Abandon previous petty suspicions. Japan will definitely provide China with productive assistance. 2. Provide necessary human and material assistance to China, which is a raw material supply country. 3. Japan must seek raw materials from China, and China must purchase Japan's refined products, and establish a reciprocal trade agreement.</p>
<p>Russia Policy - His policy toward Russia is as follows: 1. Start direct negotiations between Japan and Russia, revise the fisheries and oil agreements, and persuade the establishment of a Japan-"Manchukuo"-Russia border committee and a demilitarized zone. 2. If the Soviet Union understands Japan's sincerity, it will persuade it to expand the demilitarized zone and withdraw military facilities east of Lake Baikal. If the Soviet Union recognizes this, Japan will also agree to limit Japan's military deployment in northern Manchuria in order to completely eliminate international disputes between Japan-"Manchukuo"-Russia. As for the specific negotiations with China and Russia, the starting date will be after Ambassador Arima returns to China at the end of March, and for Russia, it will be after Ambassador Ota, who is returning home, assumes office in March.

<h3>Foreign Ministry Leaders' Meeting Listens to Yokotake's Opinions</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) At 9:30 AM today, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs held a leaders' meeting attended by Vice-Minister Shigemitsu and other department heads. Centered on Commercial Counselor Yokotake, an important consultation was held on concrete measures to establish Sino-Japanese economic cooperation. Commercial Counselor Yokotake's concrete measures are stated as follows:</p>
<p>1. Fundamentally, China must rely on its own efforts. Therefore, Japan must hire technicians to improve the cultivation methods of rice, wheat, cotton, etc., in order to reduce imports and increase exports. Because Japan alone has the potential to import 100 million gold worth of cotton, an improvement in trade may be realized. 2. There must be a thorough end to anti-Japanese sentiment, and people must realize that cheap and high-quality Japanese goods are definitely effective for China's self-reliance. 3. However, the current Chinese economy is on the verge of collapse and must be rescued. Therefore, it is necessary to lend money to China. Commercial Counselor Yokotake also made the same remarks to Foreign Minister Hirota in the afternoon. (Dentsu dispatch, 12th)</p>
<h3>The Eastern Report Claims that Minister of the Army Hayashi has Thoughts of Resigning</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) According to the Yamato Evening News, Minister of the Army Hayashi plans to resign after the parliament closes. The reasons for Minister Hayashi's thoughts of resignation are as follows: 1. Due to the issue of the Manchurian organization reform and the Tokonami's 500,000-yuan case, the pure and rational claims of the army and the political interpretations within the government are becoming increasingly sharp. Minister Hayashi is in a difficult position to please both sides. 2. In a certain day's case, the whole case will be announced to the world, and Minister Hayashi is very distressed about the concept of responsibility for this case. 3. The ministry believes that the Minister of the Army's personnel administration and parliamentary countermeasures are not thorough enough, and there is great dissatisfaction. For these three major reasons, Minister Hayashi has expressed to his close associates that he intends to make a decision to resign after the end of the Diet session. However, the internal situation is very complicated, and the environment may not allow him to resign. (Hualian Electric, 12th)</p>
<h3>French Newspaper Comments on Anglo-American Cooperation</h3>
<p>(Paris) A famous reporter, Marcel, commented in the "White Day" newspaper on the speech by South African Union Minister of Justice Smuts regarding Anglo-American cooperation against Japan, saying that his words were sharp and indicative of the diverse opinions within the British Empire. Then, if war were to break out again in Europe, it is not certain whether the major autonomous colonies would still be willing to assist the mother country. "The autonomous colonies along the Pacific and Indian Oceans undoubtedly disagree with Japan and agree with the views of the United States. Now the South African Union has turned its attention to the United States and proposed to form an alliance, which is even more surprising to London."</p>
<p>(Havas dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>(Paris) South African Union Minister of Justice Smuts delivered an emotional speech in the capital of the Philippines, suggesting that Britain and the United States cooperate closely in the Pacific. The local "Times" commented, "If Britain and the United States want to cooperate to prevent the formation of an Asian group and maintain peace in the Pacific, they must also make the United States cooperate in maintaining peace in Europe. After all, the issue of peace in Europe is something that Britain cannot but care about. General Smuts has not been able to provide a clear analysis of this level. It seems that the United States is not prepared to participate in the European coalition policy. If so, it is difficult to say whether the United States can cooperate with Britain in the near future solely to cope with the threat of Asian awakening." (Havas dispatch, 11th)</p>

<h3>US Reinforces National Defense Plan</h3>
<p>Building an Invincible Merchant Fleet</p>
<p>Strengthening Coastal Defense Works</p>
<p>(Washington) News from reliable sources today indicates that the government is currently planning to reinforce the national defense plan, which is divided into three points: ㈠ strengthening the merchant fleet; ㈡ strengthening coastal defense works; ㈢ reforming aviation bases. News of the strengthening of the merchant fleet was announced simultaneously with news of the current plan for an invincible merchant fleet. It is said that President Roosevelt had previously commissioned former Attorney General under President Wilson, Balmore, to draft a bill to enable the Navy to have the cooperation of a strong merchant fleet in the event of an incident. It is learned that Balmore has held meetings with officials of the Shipping Bureau for several weeks and has now formulated a plan to abolish postal subsidies and directly pay subsidies to American shipping companies. The bill will soon be submitted to Congress, it is said. Congress may also soon accept the Budget Committee's recommendation to allocate 20 to 30 million yuan from the 300,000,000 yuan public works budget for the construction of warships. As for naval expenditures, 4 million yuan may be proposed for the construction of floating docks at Pearl Harbor and the Pacific Ocean naval base, and it is also possible to build naval floating dock projects in Bremerton, Washington, with the same amount. It is said that the naval budget also includes the following plans: 3.5 million yuan for the construction of new-style projects at the Pensacola Naval Training Station, which has the largest aviation base in the country; ㈡ 120,000 yuan for the equipment of the Mare Island Naval Shipyard ordnance depot in San Francisco; ㈢ 100,000 yuan for the construction of the San Nicolas Air Station in California; ㈣ a radio station in St. Paul, Alaska; ㈤ 500,000 yuan for new-style equipment at the Hawaiian aviation base; ㈥ 500,000 yuan for the expansion of the submarine base in Coco Solo, Panama Canal Zone; ㈦ 800,000 yuan for the Coco Solo submarine and aviation base. Congressman Routt and Tumult also asked the House Army Committee to consolidate the defenses of the Pacific Northwest coast and Alaska. Routt said that Washington should have an aviation base, and that the entire state of Washington has no anti-aircraft artillery. Tumult said that Alaska is the proper route from Yokohama to the United States, and that if the East attacks the United States, it will undoubtedly abandon the southern route and take the route through Alaska. Therefore, although I support the defense works on the island of Hawaii, I feel that Alaska is more in need of this equipment. (Eleventh National Telegram)</p>
<h3>US Army Chief of Staff Advocates for Naval Supremacy</h3>
<p>Army and Air Force Should Be Expanded Simultaneously</p>
<p>Draft Plan Divided into Three Sections</p>
<p>Chicago – US Army Chief of Staff Bellgreno today drafted a military plan divided into three sections, one of which advocates that the United States build the most superior navy. Bellgreno also advocates that the United States actively carry out an exclusion movement. His argument is as follows: If Europe needs communism, Hitlerism, or fascism, then it is free to do so, but the United States does not need it. The United States can only accommodate Americans and American ideas. Bell's defense plan is purely defensive in nature. Bell said that the geographical location of the United States and its position in international debt should give the United States the most superior navy stipulated in the London Naval Treaty. Therefore, the United States should immediately build ships to the extent permitted by the treaty. The United States should also have a standing army whose training and equipment can be compared with those of the great powers. The army should have sufficient soldiers and munitions to defend the coasts of the United States and defend against possible aggression. The third section of the unified plan stipulates the expansion of the current National Defense Force and the adoption of conscription, so that in the event of an incident, the people can take up arms against the enemy. Bell went on to say that the Air Force should also be increased. He expressed his approval of the plan to build an aviation base in Hawaii for 11 million yuan. The US Army also requested that Congress pass a bill to gather capital and manpower to avoid the dispersion of national strength and prohibit private individuals and companies from profiting during wartime so that there is no profit to be made from munitions, etc. (Eleventh National Telegram)</p>
<h3>Saar Financial Power Returns to Germany; Franco-German Agreement Signed</h3>
<p>Rome – Experts from France and Germany handling the transfer of power in the Saar region have already completed their work. The experts have drafted 28 draft agreements in Basel, Switzerland, all of which have been initialed. The three-person committee initially proposed combining these 28 agreements into one document, but later advocated combining them into three or four agreements. The first of these, concerning currency exchange and the tariff system, was officially signed in Rome yesterday. Among the various agreements, the most important is the general agreement on the transfer of jurisdiction over mines and railways. The mines and railways in the Saar region owned by France will be redeemed by Germany at a price in accordance with the resolution of December 3 last year. The price is set at 900 million francs. The issue of leased land is being discussed by representatives of France and Germany in Berlin and will be included in the agreement after a solution is agreed upon. In addition, there are agreements on French private insurance and social insurance in the Saar region. The amount of private insurance is quite large. Although social insurance was resolved by a treaty concluded between France and Germany in 1932, it has not been implemented. A new agreement is now being drafted so that this treaty can be implemented and take effect. As for the debt settlement method, it is currently being drafted, and its form has not yet been determined. After the transfer of power in the Saar, the francs used by the people must be exchanged for marks, but it is stipulated that those leaving the Saar region, such as French people, do not have to exchange them. This is more important for private individuals than for companies. In addition, German law stipulates that those residing in German territory should deposit their capital in the central bank, but this has not yet been implemented for foreigners. An agreement will now be drawn up separately for French people and those leaving the Saar to protect them from being subject to this type of law. (Twelfth Havas Telegram)</p>
<h3>No Germs Ever Found in Chinese Eggs Imported to England</h3>
<p>British Under-Secretary of Health Answers Member's Question</p>
<p>(London) At today's meeting of the House of Commons, Conservative MP Hurt asked whether the method of making Chinese liquid eggs meets sanitary conditions, whether it has been carefully inspected after entering England, and asked the British representative in China to conduct a thorough investigation. Under-Secretary of Health Shakespeare replied that there is no clear evidence regarding sanitary conditions, but it must be inspected when it is transported to various ports in England, and if it is not suitable for human consumption, it must be confiscated. The Ministry of Health has never found germs in this type of egg product, and a mold expert is now being hired to examine its samples, he said. Hurt also asked why such a huge amount of Chinese eggs is not subject to the sanitary precautions applied to British produce. Shakespeare did not answer. (Eleventh Reuters Telegram)</p>

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>On Promoting Afforestation with Caution</h3>
<p>The Zhejiang Provincial Government plans to plant trees on both sides of the roads because more than 2,570 kilometers of roads have been built in Zhejiang Province in recent years. It is estimated that about 300,000 trees will be planted. In a passive sense, this is enough to consolidate the roadbed and add to the scenery along the road. In an active sense, it is enough to inspire interest in new construction. These trees will also have practical uses in the future.</p>
<p>China was originally a country with abundant natural resources and superior human efforts. However, since contacting other countries in the world in the past century, our abundant natural resources have not been developed, and our superior manual labor has also fallen behind. We have only relied on nature to maintain the face of an agricultural nation. Others have made progress of a thousand miles a day, but we have almost stagnated here. Even if there is some progress, it is very slow. The difference in speed is like the ratio of a bullock cart to an airplane. In such contrast, the strengths of our country's agriculture and handicrafts have gradually been submerged, and the scene of decline has become more obvious. For example, the production of wood is a by-product of agricultural countries, and at least it should be able to be self-sufficient. But the fact is just the opposite. The buildings in large cities, of course, use foreign imported wood, and even small and medium-sized cities also use foreign wood. This reflects that agricultural operators only care about current living gains and have no spare capacity to plan for slightly longer-term undertakings. I am afraid that the actual poverty situation in China is more than that. Many famous mountains and scenic spots, such as the mountains around West Lake in Hangzhou, and on Putuo Island, do not necessarily lack the financial resources to engage in tree planting, nor do they lack open space for planting. However, many mountains have become colorless barren mountains. Occasionally, due to the opportunity of some birds, one or two trees grow as decorations for the scenery, which is actually not very helpful. It is also not good for the overall mountain scenery. In the rainy season, if the rainfall is slightly more, floods will occur. If the rainfall is slightly less, there will be a shortage of drought and little room for turnover adjustment. The moisture contained in the ground decreases. If this continues for a long time, there is a danger of turning into a desert. This phenomenon is particularly obvious along the Longhai Railway from Shangqiu to Zhongmou.</p>
<p>In recent years, the whole country has gradually understood the need to promote afforestation. It is not only to decorate the scenery, but also has a great relationship with agricultural cultivation and climate regulation. Therefore, the promotion of afforestation is well known throughout the country, and some places have indeed made efforts to plant many trees. However, afforestation is a very common thing to say, and everyone has no doubts that more should be planted. It is just that when implementing it, many difficult problems immediately arise. ㈠ At present, the most common situation for farmers who cultivate the land is that there are many people and little land. The land will not increase, but the number of people eating is increasing day by day. Therefore, they want to develop land power as much as possible, regardless of the fact that trees that do not see benefits in the eyes block their hot land for production. ㈡ Although farmers are conservative, they have no time to plan for long-term facilities during the period when their lives are not yet stable. Therefore, they are not only not enthusiastic about afforestation, but also sometimes destroy existing trees. ㈢ In the present situation where the locality has exhausted its people's strength and the people are tired, even if they intend to afforest, there is no way to start. Because the source of seedlings is lacking, and there is even no financial capacity to purchase them. ㈣ Because of inconvenient transportation, even if there are trees all over the mountains in more remote places, there is no way to transport them. Moreover, the taxes are heavy, and they cannot help but hesitate. The appeal of Jianmu merchants reported in today's newspaper is due to the heavy taxes. Now the whole country knows that letting trees "grow naturally" is not a solution. Moreover, "growing naturally" takes a very long time. Therefore, proper cultivation is a necessary thing at present. The tree cultivation method should be discussed by specialists in terms of technology. Today, I will only talk about the general situation. First, we must eliminate man-made destruction so that most farmers know the importance of afforestation. Second, all public barren mountains should be planned and planted by local governments, and plants suitable for the soil of the area should be selected. It is also necessary to estimate how long it will take to harvest once after a certain period to remove the old and bring forth the new. There must also be a plan for what the use is. Even if the effect is to be achieved ten or twenty years or even longer, the intangible regulation of the climate and the tangible special income are also huge benefits. Therefore, we believe that the afforestation movement should be spread throughout the country, especially in mountainous areas.</p>
<h3>Italy Presses Abyssinia with Military and Diplomatic Advances</h3>
<p>Five Harsh Demands to Atti</p>
<p>Compensation and Apology, Respect for the Italian Flag</p>
<p>Italian Troops Mobilize Awaiting Opportunity to Attack</p>
<p>Abyssinians Resolve on Final Resistance</p>
<p>(Rome) At this time of dense war clouds in the Italo-Abyssinian War, Italy has made five demands of Atti: ㈠ Abyssinia must compensate Italy for its losses, reportedly set at one million gold pounds; ㈡ The Abyssinian government must formally apologize; ㈢ An Abyssinian must be sent to pay respects to the Italian flag; ㈣ An Italo-Abyssinian border commission must be organized; ㈤ Abyssinians must not violate the Italian border. News of these five demands was transmitted simultaneously with news that the Italian government has appointed General Graziani as commander of the Abyssinian expeditionary force. Graziani has put down the rebellion of the Libyan natives and has experience in dealing with colonial peoples. Recently, he also led troops to garrison the Austrian border. Italian sources say that there are about 30,000 Abyssinian troops gathering on the Italian border. (Twelfth National Telegram)</p>
<p>Another Telegram – At the same time as this Italo-Abyssinian War, mobilization is in full swing, and diplomatic methods are also being adopted, such as Italy's demand for compensation for losses, which is one aspect. This kind of negotiation can turn the situation towards moderation and open a way to resolve the dispute. It is said that the League of Nations has appointed a mixed commission to establish a reasonable boundary on the Italo-Abyssinian border to avoid future unfortunate events. (Twelfth National Telegram)</p>
<p>(Rome) The Abyssinian chargé d'affaires in Italy told Reuters today that if Italy wants to start a war with Abyssinia, Abyssinia intends to defend its territory to the last man. Abyssinia has an armed force of 800,000 men and can recruit another 1 million men. Abyssinia has weapons of the new era, but lacks tanks and aircraft. It is heard that 40,000 Italian troops have been stationed in Eritrea. The Italian government announced today that negotiations to resolve the dispute are currently underway in the Abyssinian capital. (Eleventh Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>Abyssinia – Here, due to the Italian mobilization, soldiers in mountain forts have recently begun test-firing rifles to cope with the Italian invasion. It is said that 50,000 to 80,000 troops have been mobilized to cope with the Italian army, all equipped with new weapons and machine guns. At the same time, the Italian mobilization has made the international situation serious. Abyssinian soldiers are accustomed to highland life and are brave and fierce. In the end, Italy may win, but things are not as simple as expected, because it is now the rainy season and it is very inconvenient for large teams to march. However, Italy continues to mobilize, so the air of war is quite strong. (Eleventh National Telegram)</p>
<p>(Rome) It is now believed that the Italian government will still try to avoid opening hostilities with Abyssinia. Today, the official explanation for the mobilization of two army divisions is that Abyssinia is currently garrisoning 30,000 troops on the border and can continue to send 100,000 more. Italy has no choice but to prepare reinforcements to defend its colonies and take steps to avoid further border conflicts. The authorities also said that the two divisions mobilized, one stationed in Florence and one stationed in Messina, totaling 30,000 troops, are ready to attack Abyssinia when necessary. The Abyssinian chargé d'affaires in Rome went to the Italian Foreign Ministry this afternoon to discuss this matter. (Eleventh Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Rome) Italian Prime Minister Mussolini has protested to Abyssinia, roughly saying that Italy has reached the end of its tolerance. If diplomacy cannot fully satisfy Italy, then Italy is ready to fight on the border between Abyssinia and Italian Somaliland. According to government explanations, Italy believes that the Abyssinian guerrillas who have repeatedly attacked the Italian army in recent times must be thoroughly eliminated, and there are many armed troops on the Abyssinian border, and these soldiers have also repeatedly disturbed border security. Mussolini has been greatly shocked, because these current situations are not overstated. The Political Council has been extremely calm, but it must now be thoroughly resolved. According to Abyssinian news, officials in the country do not believe that Italy can take the offensive at this time of year, as it is extremely difficult to march across the border. Although diplomatic relations are very tense now, officials still hope that war can be avoided. As for Italy, it pays no attention to the climate issue, because if decisive measures are not taken again, border disturbances will never end. Therefore, the army has been prepared and can depart at any time. However, even if war breaks out, it is feared that Italy, like Japan in Manchuria and the United States in Nicaragua, will not formally declare war, and Mussolini's army will directly occupy Abyssinian territory to await the end of the event, until the Italian government is satisfied. The Abyssinian army is also quite large, and if forced to, it may try its best to resist. Observers say that this kind of resistance is difficult to sustain under the heavy artillery, tanks, and other sophisticated weapons. (Eleventh National Telegram)</p>
<h3>Abyssinian Military Equipment Situation</h3>
<p>(Rome) A military magazine called "Military Power" recently published the situation of the Abyssinian military equipment. According to reports, the Abyssinian army is composed of several armed teams, some of which are directly under the Abyssinian emperor and some of which belong to local leaders. Thirty percent of the country's people can be mobilized, totaling 2 million people, but only 500,000 people have weapons. The types of weapons are of varying quality, but new-style portable machine guns have also been deployed. The artillery has a total of 180 cannons, in addition to 250 machine guns, six tanks, and more than ten aircraft. (Eleventh Havas Telegram)</p>
<h3>Truth About Italian Military Mobilization</h3>
<p>(Rome) The Italo-Abyssinian conflict has been going on for a long time, and now it has only been made public. At the same time, the actual date of the Italian mobilization and the date of the announcement are also very different. This method has aroused various rumors in political circles here. Some say that the truth of the whole facts is not as it is, and some say that not only the reservists born in 1911 have been mobilized, but also those born from 1908 to 1912 have been mobilized. Some say that all combat personnel have been mobilized, and some of them will be sent overseas in one or two days. Although it is still difficult to know the truth, the general public believes that Italy is determined to take large-scale action against Abyssinia to make Abyssinia submit. However, now it is the rainy season, and it is feared that a bad war will not occur. (Twelfth National Telegram)</p>
<h3>League of Nations Uneasy</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations today suddenly felt the seriousness of the conflict between Italy and Abyssinia, because Italian Prime Minister Mussolini mobilized troops, preparing to attack the Abyssinians and attack the defense line between Italian Somaliland and Ethiopia. It is now believed that the League of Nations Executive Council, which will meet at the end of this month to monitor the return of the Saar to Germany, may be forced to intervene in the Italo-Abyssinian conflict. Abyssinia may become the second "Manchukuo," and key figures are very uneasy. (Twelfth National Telegram)</p>
<h3>England Mediates</h3>
<p>(London) Regarding the rumor that Italy sent an ultimatum to the government of Abyssinia, officials here claimed this evening that it has not been confirmed. Britain is still mediating between the two governments to conduct direct negotiations to clarify the border between Italian territories in East Africa and Abyssinia. If so, various other outstanding issues will naturally be easier to resolve. (Eleventh Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>(London) Regarding the conflict between Italian troops and Abyssinian troops, the British government ordered its ambassador to Italy, Sir Drummond, to inquire about the news. According to Drummond's report, the Italian government has prepared two infantry divisions equipped with wartime personnel, that is, 35,000 people, but stated that this move is purely a precautionary measure. Drummond told the Italian government that he hoped that Italy could begin negotiations with Abyssinia in the near future, in accordance with the recommendation of the League of Nations Executive Council in January of this year, to resolve the dispute.

<h3>Germany Will Issue a Reply to the Anglo-French Proposal Soon</h3>
<p>Belgium Supports the Sky Pact</p>
<p>Formally Notifies the British Government</p>
<p>(Paris) Germany's reply to the Anglo-French agreement recently concluded in London is expected to be issued on Thursday. It is now believed that its wording must be vague, containing a request for negotiations, but not expressing the government's views. (Eleventh Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Paris) The Berlin correspondent of the Petit Parisien predicted the content of Germany's reply to the Anglo-French London Agreement and published its outline as follows: "The Anglo-French Agreement is sufficient to guarantee the western border of Germany and is therefore supported, but the Danube Convention, especially the East European Mutual Assistance Pact, in the form drafted in Rome and London, is strongly opposed. Germany is unwilling to guarantee the eastern border of Soviet Russia with its military force, and is also unwilling to be involved in the complicated vortex of the Balkan Peninsula. Regarding the issue of Austrian independence, Germany believes that the Danube Convention is only interesting in reducing Italy's power in Vienna. Regarding the Sky Mutual Assistance Pact, Germany believes that a general solution should be made on the issue of armaments. Germany is willing to join and should enjoy the right to equip a strong air force and possess thousands of military aircraft. As for the issue of returning to the League of Nations, this reply may not mention it in detail, because Germany believes that the content of the League of Nations is not pure and needs to be reorganized.

<h3>Draft Indian Constitution Approved on Second Reading by British Parliament</h3>
<p>Debate Fiercest on Dominion Status</p>
<p>Labor Party Amendment Ultimately Rejected</p>
<p>Baldwin Claims No Intention to Consider General Election</p>
<p>(London) During today's House of Commons debate on the second reading of the government's India Bill, Labor Party members of the opposition put forward an amendment arguing for the explicit acknowledgment of India's right to attain dominion status. After a vote, it was defeated by 404 votes to 133. Lord President of the Council Baldwin, in closing the debate, declared that the government did not wish to consider the question of a general election. There was much to be done now, and he hoped the House would work hard. (The cabinet benches cheered.) He had previously announced a period of thirty days for debating the India Bill, and nervous newspapers were interpreting this announcement of the procedure as a prelude to a general election around Christmas. (Eleventh Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) A total of 133 opposed the government's India Bill, including 80 Conservative Party members, 48 Labor Party members, 3 Independent Labor Party members, and 2 Independents. That so many Conservatives opposed the bill was quite unexpected. Of the 404 who supported the government, 28 were Liberal Party members, but Liberal Party leader Lloyd George did not vote. (Sixteenth Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) The government's India Bill has now passed its second reading. During the debate, the question of dominion status was debated most fiercely. Attorney General Inskip declared that, with regard to the dominion status that could be applied to India, the Statute of Westminster granted unlimited legislative power, except in matters affecting the constitution. Although granted equal status, it must remain within the British Empire. There was no question of India having the right to secede from the empire. All of Britain's promises to India were conditional on India not seceding from the empire. Churchill, who had previously been a strong critic of the India Bill, rose to speak, but his tone this time was unexpectedly mild, saying that he and his friends did not want to obstruct the bill. He argued that autonomy should first be granted to the provinces, so that the central government could intervene to prevent the degradation of public works. He made this argument because he deeply felt the need to protect the interests of the people, and that a plan to give power to a small number of people was contrary to democracy. Labor Party leader Lansbury said that the bill had been drafted without genuine consultation with the Indian people, and that he believed the Indian people should draft their own plan, which should include the theoretical right to secede from the empire, as with other dominions. However, he was confident that India would never exercise this right. Lord President of the Council Baldwin said that timely and generous concessions had won India's loyalty to the empire, and that we now offered India an opportunity to take a major step to become a full member of the empire, and that we should offer this opportunity in a spirit of willingness, generosity, and trust.

<h3>Doihara's Activities in Peiping</h3>
<p>Reportedly, a Dawn Has Appeared in Sino-Japanese Relations</p>
<p>Will Visit Various Dignitaries in Shanghai and Then in Beijing</p>
<p>(Peiping Communication) Doihara, the director of the Special Service Agency of the Kwantung Army stationed in Shenyang, has entered the pass with open activity. Because the people of the country remember that Pu Yi was taken to Dalian by Doihara alone in the past, they all feel that Doihara's coming here is unfathomable. Doihara lived in Peiping before the Northeast Incident, residing in Chunshu Hutong. During the Beiyang government era, the East Asia Association, jointly formed by Chinese and Japanese nationals, was located at East Single Third Street. The Chinese president was Xiong Xiling, and the Japanese president was Sakatani Rihachiro. When Sakatani returned to his country, Doihara succeeded him as president. Doihara was known as a "China expert." The association was later disbanded due to the dispersal of its members, and Doihara was no longer noticed. After Pu Yi was kidnapped in Tianjin, Doihara became famous and served as the director of the Special Service Agency of the Kwantung Army stationed in Dalian and Shenyang. Although he continued to travel between Peiping and Shenyang, his secret whereabouts attracted the attention of the general public. Recently, Doihara suddenly arrived in Peiping under the pretext of investigation and visiting friends. He visited He Yingqin, Chairman of the Military Sub-Committee, and also visited various agency leaders and old friends in Peiping, engaging in very busy socializing. The reporter visited Doihara at his residence, who readily received him. After the greetings, the reporter first asked about the purpose of this trip. Doihara replied that it was purely a private tour to investigate the local situation. Officials such as Minister He, Yuan Liang, and old friends such as Wang Shulu, Tang Erhe, and Yin Tongsheng had all been met, and he was very happy privately. The reporter then asked about the future itinerary. It was said that the investigation in Peiping was completed, and he would go to Tianjin for a short visit, stay for two days, and then go to Shanghai and then to Beijing by sea. In Shanghai and Beijing, he plans to meet with dignitaries in your country and make ordinary greetings. My trip to various places in China is purely a private activity, and since I do not represent any party to have any contact with the Chinese government, there is no task to speak of. At this point, the reporter smiled and asked if he could tell us about his impressions in Peiping. He replied that he was very satisfied. Later, when the Sino-Japanese relations issue was discussed, Doihara said that, according to his personal feelings, judging from the current situation of the two countries, he believed that a dawn has appeared. If both sides can treat each other with sincerity, the future avenue can naturally benefit both sides. Doihara then talked about the diplomatic commentary on the Sino-Japanese relations review paper written by Xu Daolin, and said that this article is indeed a public opinion in the Sino-Japanese problem, and it is no different from opening a viable path to solve the Sino-Japanese problem. On the Japanese side, it has aroused deep interest. In your country, it can be called a kind of courageous public opinion. I personally admire it very much. However, how to put this problem into practice depends on the joint research of politicians and intellectuals in both countries in order to seek a simple way to achieve twice the result with half the effort and share the success. If so, it will be of no small benefit to the friendship between China and Japan. At this point, because there were visitors, the reporter said goodbye and left. Doihara hosted a banquet at the Hotel des Nations today (the 9th) at noon to answer all parties, and then left Peiping for Tianjin at 4:30 p.m. It was scheduled to take a ship from Tianjin to Shanghai the day after tomorrow (the 11th). It is said that Doihara will stay in Shanghai for four days, and then go to Beijing. According to reliable sources, although Doihara has repeatedly stated that he has not shouldered any task for this entry, his task is implicit in what he said about the investigation. Doihara is between the steady and young factions in the Japanese Kwantung Army. His words and deeds may influence the general thinking of soldiers. Therefore, Doihara's future words and deeds after returning to Shenyang are also worthy of attention. (9th)</p>
<h3>Gansu Province Financial Reorganization Situation</h3>
<p>Abolish the Appropriation System</p>
<p>Abolish Unjust Taxes</p>
<p>(Lanzhou Communication) Gansu is located in a remote border area and has always been known as a poor area. During the Qing Dynasty, it was a province that received subsidies. After the establishment of the Republic of China, the subsidies were cut off, and military expenses greatly increased, resulting in a deficit of about 4 million yuan. The provincial treasury owed more than 10 million yuan, and the person in charge of finance was unable to cope. Therefore, the appropriation system became the only means of turnover, allowing the requisitioning agencies to extract from the collecting agencies. The amount of appropriations often exceeded the additional requisitions from various counties and bureaus. Once an appropriation was ordered, it had to be apportioned to the people, burdening officials and harming the people. The abuses were endless. Director of the Department of Finance Zhu Jingzhou, upon taking office last year, keenly understood the abuses and urgently considered eliminating them. Due to the Ningxia War, discussions were repeatedly interrupted and failed to be implemented. Now, Mr. Zhu has carefully planned the military and political expenses in detail, and has presented them to the provincial government for approval last year. From January of this year, the appropriation system will be abolished in the following counties of Longdong: Pingliang, Jingning, Longde, Zhuanglang, Huaping, Guyuan, Haiyuan, Qingyang, Ningxian, Heshui, Zhenning, Huanxian, Jingchuan, Chongxin, Zhenyuan, Lingtai, Huating, etc.; the following counties of Longnan: Tianshui, Xihe, Gangu, Wushan, Qin'an, Qingshui, Lixian, Huixian, Chengxian, Liangdang, Wudu, Wenxian, Xigu, Kangxian, etc.; and the following counties in the old Lanshan Road District: Gaolan, Linxia, Lintao, Hezheng, Yongjing, Xiahe, Ningding, Jingyuan, Longxi, Tongwei, Zhangxian, Yuzhong, Taosha, Weiyuan, Dingxi, Jingqin, Lintan, Minxian, Huining, etc. The appropriation system will be abolished first to alleviate the people's difficulties. The counties in Hexi are currently being planned in a comprehensive manner. It is expected that by the end of this year, the appropriations in the entire province can be completely cancelled. In addition, since the central government abolished the Likin tax in 1931, it has repeatedly ordered various provinces to abolish unjust taxes. Gansu, due to its special circumstances and financial difficulties, has not been able to implement this. It is now heard that Director Zhu of the Department of Finance, in accordance with the central government's intention to relieve the people's suffering, has decided to abolish the taxes in stages. Fifty-seven types of taxes that are overly burdensome and detrimental to the livelihood of civilians, totaling more than 380,000 yuan per year, have been listed and reported as the first phase, to be abolished first from January 1, 1935. Personnel have also been dispatched to various districts to investigate, and they will be abolished gradually after a detailed report. A list of abolished unjust taxes is attached below:</p>

<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>Robbed While Going to the Toilet at Night</p>
<p>Yang Xiangjin, the younger brother of farmer Yang Hesheng in Shantou Temple, was attacked while going to the toilet in the back of his house around midnight the night before. Notorious bandit Wu Suisheng (aka Xiao Asan) ambushed him outside the door, pushed Yang Xiangjin down, and stabbed him with a sharp blade. Yang shouted for help, and his brother heard the noise and called for help. Neighbor Chu Axiang came out to help capture the bandit. They immediately reported to Qin Shihai, the first squad leader of the first company of the twelfth security brigade, who led his team to the scene and arrested the criminal Wu Suisheng at the squad headquarters. During interrogation, Wu confessed to stabbing Yang and also confessed to robbing a family named Mou in the north of Hougang of four and a half piculs of white rice and cloth while selling smuggled salt on the thirteenth day of the eighth lunar month last year. On the night of the ninth day of the lunar month, he robbed a family in a thatched house on Xin Street of white rice and clothing. He confessed that he had five accomplices and that he had mortgaged a Mauser rifle at the Zhou family in the west of Changshan Dam, Haiyan, Zhejiang, for 16 yuan. Captain Qin has escorted the bandit to the brigade headquarters yesterday to await verification and handling.</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>New Trend in Various Industries Requesting Reduced Electricity Rates</p>
<p>Various associations in Suzhou, such as the Iron and Machinery Industry Association and the Silk Weaving Industry Association, have repeatedly petitioned various departments and provinces, requesting that the Suzhou Electric Plant reduce the electricity rates for motors. The details of this process have been repeatedly reported in this newspaper. It is now known that local figures have been appointed to mediate. After the chairman of the Iron and Machinery Industry Association, Liu Fuqing, and the manager of the Electric Plant, Ding Chunzhi, contacted each other on the 12th, a peaceful solution is expected. In addition, the Construction Bureau and some electricity users believe that the street light lines used by the plant are old lines from 15 years ago, and there is no outer covering on the lines. Eight years ago, there was a tragic accident in which firefighter Shi Jinkui was electrocuted to death. So many years have passed, and they have not been replaced, which is very dangerous. They are currently negotiating with the electric plant authorities, requesting that the new cable be replaced to avoid danger. If this goal cannot be achieved, it is feared that disputes will arise again.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>The Fifth Public Security Bureau Subverted</p>
<p>Yesterday morning after one o'clock, the Wuxi County Public Security Bureau received a report that gambling activities were taking place in the Wang residence in Bu Xiang Alley outside the North Gate. The Inspectorate dispatched over fifty officers and police to arrest those involved. Upon arriving at the Wang residence, it was discovered that the location was the dormitory of the First Aid Society's fire brigade of the First District and the defense post of the Ninth Detachment of the merchant corps. It being fire prevention season, most of the brigade members were already asleep. The police officers searched the premises but found nothing, and there was no sign of gambling. Upon questioning by the brigade members, the police officers successively withdrew. However, after the search, the interior was left in disarray, and the door lamp was broken. Suddenly, alarm gongs sounded, reporting a fire at the Fifth Public Security Bureau in Jiangyin Alley. The fire brigades of various sections, not knowing the truth, rushed out of their warm beds to drag their water pumps to the rescue. Some even went to the Dahe Pond behind the bureau to draw water for firefighting. At that time, the bureau chief, Hong Houchang, and bureau staff member Gu Songxun were out on patrol. The police officers inside the bureau and nearby sentry police also fled, leaving only the gate sentry, Wei Lanting, who urgently declared to the fire brigades that there was no fire. However, the crowd was large and chaotic, and the interior items, doors, windows, desks, and tables were all damaged. Fortunately, no firearms were missing. Although the prisoners in the detention center were soaked with water, none escaped. At that time, the county government, the Public Security Bureau, and the Joint Fire Brigade had received reports. Xu Yi, the detachment commander of the security team, and Feng Ziqian, the captain of the third company, immediately led their teams to the scene to suppress the situation. The Joint Fire Brigade also sent personnel. Only then did the firefighters and bystanders disperse in confusion. All the fire engines and water hoses from various sections' fire brigades, totaling twelve units, were placed in front of the Fifth Public Security Bureau. Afterward, the bureau chief Hong and staff member Gu successively reported to the Public Security Bureau, who then reported to County Magistrate Yan, awaiting resolution. The person who reported the gambling was temporarily detained at the Public Security Bureau, awaiting further investigation.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou</h3>
<p>The Zhen Tai Steamer Collides with Bridge and Capsizes</p>
<p>The Zhen Tai steamer of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, while sailing from Zhenjiang to Nantong on the tenth morning, was passing by a large bridge near Yiling Town. As usual at 8 PM, it was required to wait for the bridge to be raised before passing through. Unexpectedly, the steamer was traveling too fast and the current was strong, causing the steamer to collide with the bridge pier and capsize. Dozens of passengers fell into the water at that time. Although nearby boats provided rescue, it was nighttime, and the exact number of passengers who drowned was difficult to ascertain.</p>

<h3>The Foreign Exchange Stabilization Committee Temporarily Suspends the Purchase of Silver for Shipment to Shanghai for Regulation</h3>
<p>The Three Banks Extended the Loan Repayment Period After Closing Accounts</p>
<p>The Xin Sheng News Agency reports that the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Committee has decided to temporarily suspend the purchase of Hong Kong silver for shipment to Shanghai for regulation due to a shortage of silver in Hong Kong. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>The Stabilization Committee Temporarily Suspends the Purchase of Hong Kong Silver: In order to stabilize the market, the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Committee entrusted the Hong Kong branches of the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications to purchase silver for shipment to Shanghai for regulation. The first, second, third, fourth, and fifth batches arrived in Shanghai before the end of 1934, totaling 2,312,000 yuan in national currency. The original total purchase amount was 20 million yuan. As the closing account period for various industries in Shanghai has passed, the purchase has been temporarily suspended. A decision will be made in the future based on future needs. As for the sixth batch of cash, it is rumored that it has already been loaded on the Great American Company's Coolidge for shipment to Shanghai. The reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency visited the three committee members of the committee yesterday morning, and they all stated that they had not heard of it.</p>
<p>The Three Banks Released Loans to Regulate Finance: In view of the urgent silver shortage in Shanghai, the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications, in order to regulate finance, held a large amount of cash to provide to silver and money businesses. Before the end of 1934, up to the closing account day of February 3, a total of more than 8 million yuan was released. Now, most of these loans have been extended for repayment, except for a small number that have been recovered. No new loans have been released after the closing of accounts, but it has been decided to continue handling mortgage loans at any time, depending on the needs of the market.</p>
<p>After the end of 1934, various industries have opened one after another. The daily published foreign exchange interest rates in the money market, except for two points on the first day, have been six points for several consecutive days. It is found that every time after the end of the closing of accounts, when money shops enter the market, because the demand for cash among money shop colleagues is relatively small, the foreign exchange interest rate is usually a white premium.</p>
<p>Stayed in Japan and Taiwan for two months and thoroughly investigated the planting of tea trees and the method of tea production. Japan currently produces a total of 5 million dan of tea, and Taiwan approximately 2 million dan. Although the quantity is not large, when compared with China, it is only equivalent to China's export quantity. However, the quantity that increases each year is extremely alarming. There is still a trend of increasing year by year, and their attention to the equipment of tea is far better than that of China. For example, Japan spent more than 3 million yuan on tea equipment last year. As a result, its quality is also becoming increasingly superior, and both quality and quantity have been improved. China's tea industry is sticking to old methods and not making any improvements. As a result, the international sales market is gradually declining, and Japanese tea has the potential to encroach on Chinese tea. If improvements are not made quickly, the future is truly unimaginable. I also plan to go to Nanyang for further inspection and will set off within a few days. After returning from Nanyang, I will draft a report and submit it to the National Economic Council for reference as a basis for improving China's tea industry.</p>

<h3>Coal Industry Public Bonds Mortgaging Cash</h3>
<p>Banking circles are quite hesitant</p>
<p>Nanjing telephone, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce once requested to issue 20 million yuan of coal industry public bonds, and the Ministry of Finance considered it too large and has been stalled until now. Recently, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce has reiterated its previous request due to the increasing decline of the coal industry and has negotiated with the Ministry of Finance several times and has obtained the consent of the Ministry of Finance and discussed with the Shanghai banking community to mortgage cash with bonds. The banking community considers that the national coal sales are sluggish and there is a danger of excess, and it is hesitant to accept loans, and the number may have to be reduced in the future.</p>

<h3>The Municipal Council Held a Meeting Yesterday and Wang Xiaolai Was Elected as Chairman</h3>
<p>Passed the Temporary Budget for Fiscal Year 23</p>
<p>Disaster Relief Fund Should Still Be Included in the Budget as a Special Appropriation</p>
<p>The Municipal Council held a meeting yesterday, attended by councilors Wang Xiaolai, Du Yuesheng, Lu Jingshi, Qin Runqing, Qian Xinzhi, Yu Qiaqing, Liu Zhanen, Xu Yongzuo, Wang Yansong, and Wang Yiting, and Municipal Government Representative Yu Hongjun. Wang Xiaolai was elected as temporary chairman. After the meeting was conducted as usual and reported, the chairman was re-elected, and Wang Xiaolai was unanimously elected as chairman. Subsequently, the temporary budget for general fiscal year 23 was discussed. Since the proposal was slightly tighter than the previous year, it was passed as is. However, the disaster relief fund of 30,000 yuan was listed in the temporary budget for the previous fiscal year, and it was not included this year. The councilors believed that last year's harvest was poor and rice prices were rising. It is still difficult to predict how high rice prices will be when the green and yellow do not meet this year. The previous budget should be included as a special appropriation, and if there is a shortage, it should be spent from the reserve fund to maintain people's food and value people's livelihood. A letter has been sent to the municipal government for review.</p>

<h3>The Ministry of Railways Responds to the Chamber of Commerce Urging Payment of the Jinpu Railway Vehicle Purchase Public Bonds</h3>
<p>Has Ordered the Bureau to Quickly Determine a Method</p>
<p>According to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, the Jinpu Railway Vehicle Purchase Public Bondholders' Association sent a letter stating that the Jinpu Railway Bureau issued 1 million yuan of vehicle purchase public bonds in 17 years, and the coupon stated that the principal would be repaid in installments from January 20 years. The term was extended for two years on the pretext of the war. Just when the bondholders were looking forward to it, on December 20, 22 years, a notice of extension of repayment for one year was issued again. Now the extension period has passed, and there is still no official announcement of repayment. I implore you to help so that it can be effective. The association sent a telegram to the Ministry of Railways on the beautiful day of last month, requesting to inform the railway bureau to take care of the previous agreement and not extend the term again. The association received a telegram from the Ministry of Railways yesterday, which is recorded as follows: Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, I know about the beautiful telegram. Regarding the case of the Jinpu Railway Vehicle Purchase Public Bondholders requesting the repayment of the principal and interest, the ministry has repeatedly received petitions from the bondholders and has transferred them to the railway for review and reply for verification. According to the previous situation, in addition to re-telegraphing the bureau to quickly review and reply, it will notify the bondholders to contact the bureau after the method is verified and approved.

<h3>Team Leader Appointment Letter</h3>
<p>To whom it may concern, In recent years, the people of our nation, recognizing the imminent peril of our national destiny and the importance of aviation construction, have established this Association. We are actively engaged in recruiting members and soliciting substantial donations. The first round of fundraising resulted in the generous contributions of patriotic compatriots throughout the city, totaling 1,394,870.911 yuan in silver. These funds have already been used to purchase warplanes, and naming ceremonies have been held successively for each aircraft, which have been contributed to the government and incorporated into the air force. However, this is a significant undertaking that relies on the continued efforts of compatriots nationwide to contribute enthusiastically in order to achieve the goal of defending against aggression and ensuring survival. The Association has resolved to launch the Second Fundraising Campaign in Shanghai, expanding membership recruitment, continuing to collect membership dues, and raising funds for aviation-related national salvation. We have already established simplified rules for the General Headquarters office, a plan of action, and fundraising reward measures. We have entrusted Iron City with the responsibility of serving as the General Team Leader of the Second Fundraising Campaign in Shanghai. This matter concerns the fate of our nation, and we dare not decline. However, we believe our abilities are limited, and we rely on the collaboration and support of esteemed individuals in the city to achieve significant results. We have long admired your leadership and patriotic enthusiasm, which is second to none. If you were to raise your voice, patriotic compatriots would surely respond and join enthusiastically, contributing generously. Therefore, we specifically appoint you as the Team Leader of the Second Fundraising Campaign in this city for the China Aviation Association. Enclosed is a letter of appointment. We earnestly request that you accept the position, work diligently, and jointly accomplish this grand endeavor. This is our sincere hope. Respectfully addressed to Mr. So-and-so, Wu Tiecheng, February 1, Year 24.</p>
<h3>Five Stock Exchange Brokers' Associations Telegraph the Central Government Requesting a Delay in the Collection of Transaction Taxes</h3>
<p>Letter to the Federation of Stock Exchanges to Act in Unison</p>
<p>Will Petition in Beijing Again If Necessary</p>
<p>The Shanghai Yarn and Cloth, Securities, Gold, Flour, and Miscellaneous Grains stock exchange brokers' associations, feeling unable to bear the burden of the Ministry of Finance's scheduled collection of transaction taxes, held their ninth joint meeting at the Yarn and Cloth Stock Exchange Brokers' Association yesterday at 4:00 PM. They resolved to telegraph the central government, requesting a delay in the collection to safeguard commerce. Details of the situation are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Attending Representatives: Yesterday's attendees included Bian Futang, Kuang Jian, Zhang Bojin, and Shao Wenmei from the Yarn and Cloth Stock Exchange; Wang Yingchang, Wang Jiafu, and Zhan Liansheng from the Gold Stock Exchange; Wang Zhengru and Wu Limen from the Securities Stock Exchange; Zhang Weiyun, Zhu Jiansheng, Yang Jingcheng, and Wang Zhongliang from the Flour Stock Exchange; and Xue Chengzhang from the Miscellaneous Grains Stock Exchange, totaling over a dozen people.</p>
<p>Resolutions: Bian Futang was elected chairman. After formal greetings, the chairman reported the purpose of the meeting and then began discussion. 1) Regarding the Ministry of Finance's collection of transaction taxes, although the Legislative Yuan has reduced various tax rates, it is difficult to bear this burden during this time of commercial depression. How should this Association express its views? It was resolved: (A) Telegraph the Central Government requesting a delay; (B) Send a letter to the Federation of Stock Exchanges to take unified action; (C) Recent newspaper reports have stated that some people advocate requesting the government to postpone collection for one year. This news is inaccurate and a letter should be sent to the Federation of Stock Exchanges to correct the reports. The meeting adjourned at approximately 7:00 PM. According to a reporter from the Industrial and Commercial News Agency, if the association's request is not granted by the Ministry of Finance, it is determined to send representatives to petition in Beijing again, not stopping until the objective is achieved.</p>
<p>Telegraph Requesting a Delay in Collection: Yesterday, the association telegraphed the Central Political Council, National Government Chairman Lin, Military Affairs Commission Chairman Chiang, Legislative Yuan President Sun, Executive Yuan President Wang, Minister of Finance Kong, and Minister of Industry Chen, stating: "We have recently seen reports that the Legislative Yuan has reduced the tax rates of the transaction tax regulations for stock exchanges, showing your esteemed Yuan and Ministry's deep understanding of the hardships faced by businesses. Associations like ours dare not be silent. Due to the pressing circumstances, we venture to telegraph again, hoping for your kind consideration. We have previously reported that an economic crisis is imminent, and we have repeatedly appealed regarding the difficult circumstances of businesses. We did not expect that within a month, various flaws would emerge rapidly and the level of panic would worsen day by day. During the accounting period in Shanghai's financial circles, due to fluctuations in the overall economic malaise, various loans could not be recovered upon maturity, leading to difficulties and illiquidity. The situation is precarious and fraught with danger. As a result, nearly ten Huihua Qianzhuang (money shops) which are members of the Shanghai Qianye Dagonghui, known for their sound organization and strong financial resources, have been liquidated and closed, accounting for a strong tenth of the total membership of the industry. Other industries, factories, and shops have closed or suspended business one after another, facing precarious situations. The urgency of the situation is becoming increasingly apparent. Although various industries have resumed business as usual after the Spring Festival holiday, they have all fallen into a lifeless state due to financial exhaustion. Regarding the daily turnover of associations like ours, new transactions have been very few since the beginning of spring, presenting a bleak picture unseen in recent years. The rapid and widespread spread of the economic downturn is even more severe than when associations like ours previously reported. We observe that the serious prelude to future disasters is just beginning. The financial crisis is such, and the commercial recession is such. Merchants are in difficult times, and if they want to maintain the status quo, they are still worried about various problems. How can they bear to pay taxes? Although the collection of this tax was previously stipulated by your esteemed Yuan and Ministry, in this extraordinary period of commercial depression, the burden on businesses will inevitably increase, and transactions will inevitably decrease. The impact is unimaginable. Associations like ours have repeatedly considered that we can only request your esteemed Yuan and Ministry to consider the current difficulties and allow the tax case to be postponed. Under these circumstances, it is by no means possible to bear it within three to five years, and we should wait for the market to recover to a prosperous and normal state before collecting it, so that both national taxes and commercial strength can be considered, and we can uphold the late Premier's legacy of the Principle of People's Livelihood, and show the government's intention to let the people rest. The future of commerce really depends on this. In addition, public bonds and treasury bills are issued by the state, and there is no precedent for taxation in countries around the world. If they are taxed in the same way as other marketable securities, it is tantamount to restricting people's investment in national debt. In terms of both reason and sentiment, it should be inappropriate. We request the Legislative Yuan to remove public bonds and treasury bills from the category of marketable securities and exempt them from taxation with explicit provisions. The above requests are humbly submitted for approval and implementation, which would be a great kindness. We are extremely fearful and await orders. Respectfully presented by Bian Futang, representative of the Shanghai Chinese Yarn and Cloth Stock Exchange Brokers' Association; Wang Zhengru, representative of the Securities Stock Exchange Brokers' Association; Zhan Liansheng, representative of the Gold Stock Exchange Brokers' Association; Zhang Janyun, representative of the Flour Stock Exchange Brokers' Association; and Xue Chengzhang, representative of the Miscellaneous Grains Stock Exchange Brokers' Association."</p>
<h3>News of the Emergency Relief General Donation Association</h3>
<p>The Emergency Relief General Donation Association previously entrusted various newspaper offices, banks, money shops, companies, stores, tea houses, Chinese and Western pharmacies, and movie theaters to collect general donations. The second phase of settlement was originally scheduled for the end of last month. However, due to the Lunar New Year, stores were busy closing and did not submit the collected donations to the association. The association then sent letters urging various banks and stores to submit the collected donations. The response has been very enthusiastic. It is reported that yesterday, the Ningbo Industrial Bank submitted 108 yuan in silver, the French Concession branch of the China Industrial Bank submitted 36.7 yuan in silver, the Zhongfu Bank submitted 13 yuan in silver, the Jincheng Silk Shop submitted 5 yuan in silver, the Guoan Trust Company submitted 1.9 yuan in silver, the Banhua Garden Restaurant submitted 2.6 yuan in silver, the Guotai Photo Studio submitted 1 yuan in silver, the Hengxun Money Shop submitted 2 yuan in silver, the Shanghai Tongyi Trust Company submitted 1 yuan in silver.</p>
<p>In addition, the Great Beauty Evening News submitted 8 yuan in silver, and the Dunren Girls' Elementary School submitted 8 yuan in silver and 1.02 yuan in small silver coins.</p>
<h3>The Machine Industry Association Advised Factories to Respect National Sovereignty</h3>
<p>Establishment of a Special Committee to be Decided at the Next Meeting</p>
<p>The Shanghai Machine-Made National Goods Factory Federation previously organized a special committee to deal with the French Concession Police Department's refusal to inspect factories. However, the meeting was not convened due to the general accounting of various industries. Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, the Machine Industry Association held a special executive meeting to determine the date for the official establishment of the special committee. However, due to insufficient attendance, discussion could not proceed and it was decided to leave the decision to the next meeting (on the 19th). It is reported that the Machine Industry Association intends to petition the municipal government for negotiations in the near future in order to effectively cope with the situation. At the same time, it will also inspect the member factories at any time, earnestly advising all factories to refuse foreign investigations in order to uphold national sovereignty.</p>
<h3>Public Bond Transactions are Legitimate and Legal Business</h3>
<p>Futures Trading of Public Bonds Cannot Be Considered Speculation</p>
<p>According to Xin Xin News Agency, it was reported on the 8th of this month that during the discussion of the transaction tax in the Legislative Yuan, it was stated that the futures trading of public bonds has a speculative nature. A reporter from Xin Xin News Agency met Mr. Zhang Weiru from the financial sector yesterday to discuss this matter. Mr. Zhang said, "Public bond transactions are originally legitimate and legal business. The occurrence of buying and selling depends entirely on the needs of supply and demand, with prices determined accordingly. Sometimes, when financing is tight, the bond price is low and supply exceeds demand. When financing is relaxed, the bond interest rate is low and demand is high. For example, individuals or shops may have payments due and estimate the time required to purchase futures, earning interest on a regular basis. Conversely, they may sell futures to cope with payments. Through cycles of buying and selling, the futures market becomes prosperous." He further elaborated: "(A) Financial institutions or individuals purchase bonds for the current month and sell futures for the next month, calculating the difference between principal and interest to earn profits. This is called arbitrage in commercial terms. The turnaround is convenient, and the term is not long. The amount of interest depends on the tightness of financing. Since there are accurate estimates, the business is not risky. It is purely an investment and definitely not speculation. (B) Investors in bonds are not limited to Shanghai. The securities market is centered in Shanghai, so merchants from other places entrust securities brokers to buy and sell through letters and telegrams. Even if there is spot trading, it is difficult to transport the goods in advance. Therefore, futures trading must be done to prepare for delivery upon maturity. (C) Shops or individuals plan to invest in public bonds, but the current cash is expected to be received in a certain period of time. Therefore, they purchase futures for the next month and receive the goods upon maturity." The above three points cannot be solved by spot trading alone. Judging from the situation in Shanghai, the first two types account for the majority of transactions. The market is becoming increasingly busy because of this. The financial sector uses this to circulate funds, adjust surpluses and deficits, and popularize it among the masses. The credit of public bonds is becoming increasingly solid, and national economy and social finance rely on it. It seems a bit theoretical to call it speculation. In fact, these types of transactions can definitely not be considered speculation."</p>
<h3>The Two Railways Issue Notices to Pay Attention to On-Time Train Operation</h3>
<p>Shanghai-Ping Train Arrives More Than Half an Hour Late</p>
<p>Should Make the Greatest Determination to Maintain and Improve</p>
<p>The Vehicle Affairs and Locomotive Affairs Departments of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Bureaus jointly issued Notice No. 81 the day before yesterday, stating: "On-time train operation is the most important goal of the railway. Although the traffic density of railways in Europe and the United States is high, passenger trains rarely arrive late. On the other hand, the Shanghai-Ping train often arrives more than half an hour late. Fast trains and express trains often arrive about two hours late. In addition, it is rare for regional trains and slow trains to arrive on time. The reasons for the delays are extremely complex, but the employees of our Vehicle Affairs and Locomotive Affairs Departments are most closely related. Self-improvement is essential for rectification. In the future, all relevant employees of the Vehicle Affairs and Locomotive Affairs Departments should make the greatest determination to maintain and improve on-time train operation. Even a minute's delay should be avoided. If a train is delayed, regardless of whether the reason belongs to the Vehicle Affairs, Locomotive Affairs, or other aspects, the employees of the Vehicle Affairs and Locomotive Affairs Departments should regard it as a major issue and a disgrace. They must report the details truthfully for verification and handling. If there are suggestions for improvement regarding equipment, personnel, or employee perceptions, they should be reported in detail for our departments to take remedial measures. Those who do well will be rewarded, and those who are perfunctory or mismanaged will be severely punished upon verification. Our departments have made the greatest determination. All relevant employees must understand our departments' intention to rectify train operation, encourage each other, and not regard it as a mere formality, lest they be found guilty of serious violations. This notice is issued jointly for strict compliance."</p>
<h3>More Requests for Relief for the Spring Famine in Jiangsu and Zhejiang</h3>
<p>The Renji Road Sino-Foreign Charity Relief Association believes that due to the widespread drought last year, Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces suffered the most severe disasters. It immediately sent staff to investigate and selectively provide relief. Counties such as Liyang, Yixing, Danyang, Jiangpu, Gaochun, Lishui, and Jurong in Jiangsu, and Haining, Haiyan, Jiangshan, Changshan, Longyou, and Tongxiang in Zhejiang have all been involved. Unfortunately, the winter relief has not yet ended, and news of the spring famine has arrived again. According to recent telegrams and letters from various sources, the details are as follows: 1) The Liyang Drought Relief Committee telegraphed that Liyang suffered a severe drought last year, the severity of which has not been seen in a century. Your association and other charitable organizations came to Liyang to provide emergency relief, saving countless lives. We are deeply grateful and cannot express it in words. Now it is early spring, and the people have no food and cannot farm. Moreover, the old and weak are wailing in the fields. How can we encourage planting? The coming disaster is unimaginable. We hope that your association will continue to do good deeds and provide relief to the end, and help raise funds for spring relief so that the victims who survived the winter will not die in the spring. Then, the virtue of saving hundreds of thousands of lives will be attributed to your association. The telegram is urgent and awaits orders. 2) Father Wang of the Jiangshan County Catholic Church wrote that Jiangshan is located in the remote border of Zhejiang, with overlapping mountains and few fields. Even in fertile years, it is only self-sufficient. Unexpectedly, there was a severe drought last summer, which caused the crops to wither and die, and the autumn harvest was hopeless. The livelihoods of farmers were cut off. Some people dug ferns and boiled grass to satisfy their hunger, and those who sold their sons and daughters blocked the roads. Starved and emaciated people were everywhere, and the sound of hunger could be heard everywhere. The Jiangshan Disaster Relief Association planned to sow buckwheat to try to make up for the loss. However, the autumn sun was scorching, and it still did not rain. They were deeply anxious. Unexpectedly, there was a heavy frost, and the buckwheat was killed. Another hope was dashed. Moreover, a large team of Red Bandits from Zhabei (a district of Shanghai) fled to Zhejiang, and local bandits helped the evildoers. Wherever the bandits went, such as Guanxi, Puhu, and Hecun and more than a dozen villages, they were not only robbed, but also murdered and set fires. The misery of the displaced victims was unbearable to witness. Fortunately, the officials and soldiers were courageous and drove back the bandits. However, the essence of the local area was almost completely lost. Jiangshan suffered these two major disasters. The dead cannot be brought back to life, and the scars are everywhere. Without considerable relief, the people will inevitably die together or become bandits. The Church is appealing to the kind-hearted gentlemen of the world to provide relief. It is said that each relief effort of the association feels that there are too many disaster victims and that the relief funds are insufficient. As a result, all the funds are exhausted. Recently, there has been another spring famine, and they are at a loss. They urgently hope that all sectors will quickly provide assistance so as not to fail in their efforts.</p>
<h3>The Jisheng Association's Report on the Tragic Disaster in Jiangshan</h3>
<p>The China Jisheng Association has just completed the emergency relief in Haining and Haiyan, Zhejiang, and is now handling the work-relief in Zhangguo and other villages in the southern countryside of Nanjing, and jointly handling the spring relief in Gaochun. Now it has received a report from Mr. Wang Yanlun, a priest of the Catholic Church in Jiangshan County, stating that Jiangshan is located in the remote border of Zhejiang, and is connected to Zhabei, Gannan, and Kunshan. It has always been known as a prosperous place, but in recent years, due to the many bandits in neighboring areas, governance has become more difficult. Moreover, its location at Xianxia, with overlapping mountains and sparse fields, means that even in years of good harvests, it is only self-sufficient. The harvest was poor the year before last, and the people had little savings. Unexpectedly, after the Dragon Boat Festival last year, it did not rain for seventy days, the crops withered and died, and the autumn harvest was hopeless. The farmers, whose lives were at stake, worked hard day and night, irrigating the fields. However, when the water source was cut off and there was no water to draw, they cried to the heavens and were helpless. The land was barren and the people were poor, and there was nothing to borrow. Those who dug ferns and boiled grass to satisfy their hunger and those who sold their sons and daughters blocked the roads. Emaciated refugees filled the fields, and the sound of hunger could be heard everywhere. It was heartbreaking to see. The Jiangshan Disaster Relief Association planned to sow buckwheat to try to make up for the loss. However, the autumn sun was scorching, and it still did not rain, causing deep anxiety. Unexpectedly, there was a heavy frost, and the buckwheat was killed. Moreover, a large team of Red Bandits from northern Fujian fled to Zhejiang, and local bandits helped the evildoers. Wherever the bandits went, such as Guanxi, Qingxi, Hecun, Maojiacang, Xintangbian, Shangtai, Baoan, Shangyu, and Dachen, they were not only robbed, but also murdered and set fires, kidnapped people for ransom, and mothers cried and children wept, wives cried and husbands wailed. The tragic deaths were scattered everywhere, and the fleeing refugees were unbearable to hear or see. Although the dangerous city was finally secured and the fierce bandits were driven back, the essence of the local area was almost completely lost. Jiangshan, with its poor people and exhausted wealth, suffered these two major disasters. The dead cannot be brought back to life, and the scars are everywhere. Without considerable relief, the people will inevitably become bandits. Moreover, there are still many bandits on the border who will come out at any opportunity. Without a way to eliminate them, how can we prevent them from recurring? We dare to ask for the allocation of benevolent syrup to save our disaster victims. The 3,000 members of the church and 310,000 people of Jiangshan are waiting with great anticipation to thank you, etc. After reading this report, with the commerce in Shanghai so depressed and the disasters in various places so serious, people with compassion are at a loss and can only cry together.</p>

<h3>China Travel Service Establishes Inns in Beishan and Wuxie</h3>
<p>Zhuji Wuxie and Jinhua Beishan on the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway are famous scenic spots in eastern Zhejiang. Recently, with the beautiful spring and pleasant scenery, people from all over the world have been visiting in droves. In order to entertain tourists from afar, the China Travel Service has specially sent personnel to plan to establish inns in suitable locations in the two famous scenic spots to provide food and lodging for tourists. In addition, the fees for baggage handling and river crossing at each station along the railway have always been quoted in foreign currencies. As the market prices in various places fluctuate, it is inevitable that there will be trickery and deception of merchants. In view of this, the railway has changed all the above fees to copper coins and made the price list into signs to be hung at each station so that passengers can easily see them.</p>

<h3>Silk and Satin Prices Expected to Rise This Year</h3>
<p>Interview with Wu Zhihao, Leader of the Silk and Satin Industry</p>
<p>Price Increase is Not Surprising</p>
<p>Prices May be Higher After Autumn</p>
<p>Since the resumption of business after the Spring Festival holiday, the prices of various goods in the Shanghai silk and satin industry have increased slightly. At this time of economic downturn, this price increase has surprised many people in society. A reporter from Guowen News Agency met with Wu Zhihao, a leader in the silk and satin industry, yesterday. According to him, the price increase in the silk and satin industry is not surprising. Every year after the opening of business after the New Year, prices will increase slightly, and then gradually decrease after the new spring silkworm cocoons enter the market. This year is the same. The main reason is that inventories are not high, and the demand in the market has not decreased. However, there are special circumstances this year, that is, in the past few decades, after the New Year, each store had to purchase a certain amount of goods. However, this year, only a few stores can purchase goods. And according to my observation (Wu said himself), the price of silk will definitely rise after the autumn this year. The main reason is that in recent years, due to the low price of silk, high labor and food costs, silkworm farmers have suffered excessive losses. Raising something else would be better, so it is expected that this year's rearing will be limited.</p>
<h3>Huang Jiemin Arrested for Illegally Establishing a Drug Eradication Society</h3>
<p>Established Articles of Association and Collected Substantial Fees</p>
<p>Organized and Paraded Without Approval</p>
<p>Huang Jiemin from Suzhou, who previously worked as a clerk for the late lawyer Cai Nipei, saw that Chiang Kai-shek, Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission, had promulgated strict regulations prohibiting potent drugs, and that the central government was also strictly enforcing the ban on opium, aiming to eradicate it nationwide within six years. He then saw a great opportunity to make money and established the "China Public Drug Eradication Society." He rented house number 8, Sanrui Lane, 201 Tongfu Road in western Shanghai as the society's general office. He printed articles of association, declarations, and provisional rules for subsidizing the society's expenses, and distributed them everywhere to recruit members. The qualifications for becoming a member were divided into five categories: (A) Group member, required to contribute 100 yuan annually; (B) Branch member, first-class branch members required to contribute 1,000 yuan annually, second-class 500 yuan, third-class 200 yuan, fourth-class 100 yuan; (C) Basic member, divided into individual and student categories, individuals required to contribute 10 yuan or more annually, students were exempt from fees; (D) Honorary member, required to contribute 100 yuan or more annually; (E) Fee-paying items, stipulating that branch certificates cost 5 yuan each, member badges 2 yuan each, and student badges 1 yuan each. It was also stipulated that those who joined the society, once identified as a certain type of member, should pay all the required fees at once, and failure to pay by the deadline would result in the revocation of membership. The treatment of members was also stipulated. Those who organized branches in various provinces, cities, counties, and districts would have their fees temporarily deferred, and the member certificates and badges they obtained on behalf of the members would be calculated at 75% of the price, with the remaining 25% being the branch's remuneration. If a member could gather three or more like-minded people to join the society, the member's certificate fee would be waived. If more than three people were introduced, 25% of the certificate fee would be offered as a reward. Official members who worked for more than one year and had excellent drug eradication achievements would be recommended by the society to the authorities to be appointed as members of the county opium prohibition committee. Those with special merits would be recommended to the National Government for generous rewards. Huang even submitted the process of organizing the society to the Ministry of Interior of the National Government, the Central Party Headquarters, the Public Guidance Committee, and the Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters, hoping to fraudulently register it, in the hope of using government offices as a protective talisman. Internal instructions were successively sent to the Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters for submission, but the Municipal Party Headquarters had long been aware of its intentions, and only because it used the name of persuading people to quit opium did not directly denounce it, but only approved that the nature of the society was the same as that of the Drug Resistance Association. Since there was a Drug Resistance Association first, there was no need to establish another name, and they could join the association to work, etc. However, Huang still did not realize it, and repeatedly petitioned the Jiangsu Provincial Government and other agencies, but was rejected. At that time, the Public Concession Bureau of the Shanghai Municipal Council also felt that Huang's actions might hinder the work of the bureau's drug prohibition team, and were suspected of violating Article 165 of the Criminal Law. The bureau's legal team put forward a discussion on whether to ban it. As a result, because no evidence of fraud was found, a laissez-faire attitude was adopted and no interference was made for the time being. Seeing that the police station under its jurisdiction had not interfered, Huang did not regard the approval or disapproval of registration as a measure of progress, and became even more flamboyant. Recently, it was heard by the Nanchang Headquarters of the Military Affairs Commission, which ordered the Shanghai Garrison Command to instruct the Municipal Public Security Bureau to send inspectors Ding Xubao and Wu Yihong to go to the address with Chinese and foreign detectives from the Chengdu Road Police Station the day before yesterday, arrest Huang Jiemin, and search out two wooden seals, 18 badges, five account books, eight official letters, as well as the society's articles of association, declarations, leaflets, and correspondence between members, and bring them all to the police station. He was escorted to the First Special District Local Court yesterday morning, where Judge Wu Tingqi conducted a preliminary hearing. Zhang Tianyin, the police station's lawyer, stated the process of the police station's assistance in arresting Huang and the reasons why the society was not banned immediately when it was established. Next, Zhan Jifeng, the legal advisor of the Public Security Bureau, stated that the society was an illegal organization, and Huang had also interfered with the police power of the Public Security Bureau. Now that he had been arrested by the order of the Nanchang Headquarters of the Military Affairs Commission, he should request permission to transfer him. Judge Wu then questioned Huang Jiemin's confession about the procedures for organizing the society, but firmly denied that he had committed fraud. Finally, Huang's lawyers Fan Gang and Fan Qisheng defended him. As a result, Judge Wu ruled that Huang Jiemin was obviously suspected of fraud and approved the transfer to the representative of the Public Security Bureau, together with the evidence, for investigation. The police station's lawyer requested that Huang be temporarily detained at the police station during the appeal period, which was approved by the court.</p>
<p>The number of silkworms will inevitably decrease, and the price of silk will also inevitably increase, so the price of silk fabrics will also inevitably rise along with the price of silk.</p>
<h3>International Trade Bureau Introduces Domestically Produced Goods</h3>
<p>Pig Bristles and Flashlight Shells</p>
<p>Pig bristles are the hairs that grow on the back of pigs, as hard as needles, and about two to seven inches long. Their quality is judged by the place of origin, the slaughter period, the length, and the color. Generally, those produced in cold regions are better than those produced in temperate regions. The bristles obtained from the spring slaughter period are better than those obtained from the autumn slaughter period. Long and white bristles are more expensive than short and black ones. Wild boar bristles are more expensive than domestic pig bristles. Their main use is as raw materials for making brushes. White pig bristles can be used for toothbrushes, hairbrushes, and hat brushes. They are often exported from Mongolia, the three northeastern provinces, North China, and Central China to countries such as Britain, France, and the United States, in very large quantities, with Tianjin, Chongqing, and Hankou being the distribution centers. Those produced in Sichuan are of the best quality and occupy an important position in the European market. The Finnish Boromeisen Company needs pig bristles that are five to ten inches long and hopes that exporting merchants will inform the bureau so that it can introduce them.</p>
<p>There are many places in the interior of our country without electric lights, so the demand for flashlights is very high. Therefore, operators of flashlights set up factories to manufacture them, because the capital is small and it is easy to do. There are now many factories in Shanghai that manufacture small light bulbs for flashlights, and there are also many factories that manufacture flashlight shells. Their products are excellent and sell well. The New York Gas Company needs flashlight shells from our country and has specifically sent a letter to the bureau to introduce them. Those who are willing to export this kind of goods can write to the International Trade Bureau for introduction. The address is under the New Rubbish Bridge.</p>
<h3>Tragic and Strange Event: Child's Body Burned</h3>
<p>Yinyang Twins Can Cure Consumption</p>
<p>Origin of the Child's Body Not Verified</p>
<p>| Suspect Woman, Chen Xu, Acted Suspiciously |</p>
<p>A case of killing a baby was discovered on Xingjiazhai Road, Zhabei, yesterday, and the baby was set on fire and refined. The behavior was cruel. Fortunately, it was discovered by neighbors and reported to the police for capture. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Strange Odor. Number 2, Yuyuan Lane, Xingjiazhai Road near Xingjia Wood Bridge, Zhabei, is the residence of Chen Xu, a widowed woman from Yuyao. Although the woman is almost fifty years old, she still powders her face and applies rouge, not reducing her youthful demeanor. The neighbors looked askance. But since there were no other anomalies, they got along well. Yesterday at noon, when the neighbors were having lunch, they suddenly smelled a strange odor coming from the air. People wanted to vomit. At that time, the neighbors thought it was blown from afar, so they did not take it seriously. But the more they smelled, the more foul it became. They suspected something was wrong and rumors flew. People questioned each other, and for a time, the neighborhood was noisy and chaotic.</p>
<p>Setting Fire and Burning. Some busybodies followed the strong odor and traced it to the front of number 2. They suddenly saw black and white smoke coming out of the door cracks. The stench was also coming out of this place. The double doors were tightly closed, and no one knew what was going on. So everyone peered into the door cracks and saw Chen Xu standing in the room, burning something that looked like meat on the ground. There was water all over the ground, and the stench was coming from here. After seeing this, the neighbors planned to knock on the door and go in to see the truth. But they knocked for a long time without response. They only saw Xu's face panicked through the door cracks, as if she was afraid of being caught in a hidden matter.</p>
<p>Several Pieces of Human Flesh. Seeing that things were suspicious, the neighbors did not make a sound.</p>
<p>They hurriedly reported to the Yinxinggang Public Security Sub-bureau, which dispatched police to rush there. Since knocking on the door was unanswered, they broke the door and entered. They saw bloodstains on the ground, and several tiles were covering the stove. Several pieces of human flesh were being burned on the tiles. The stench was unbearable. There were still several pieces of human flesh next to the stove that had not been burned. Chen Xu saw that her secrets had been discovered, and she was immediately trembling and pale. The police officers immediately arrested Chen Xu and took her, along with the corpses of two male and female babies, tile shards, knives, etc., to the sub-bureau. After being strictly interrogated by the sub-bureau,</p>
<p>Origin of the Babies. According to her confession, it was rumored that if you could get yinyang twins, refine them into ash with yinyang tiles, it could cure all consumption diseases for men and women. After searching for a long time, she finally obtained them recently in a garbage can on Di Siwei Road. She originally had the heart of saving people and had no intention of deliberately killing babies. When asked about the real origin of the male and female babies, she was evasive and refused to confess the truth. After reviewing the confession, the sub-bureau chief thought that this case was cruel and inhuman, and the origin of the babies must be investigated. He ordered Xu to be temporarily detained and then sent for trial after the investigation. For a time, the nearby neighborhoods were blocked by spectators.</p>
<h3>Detective Beaten Down by Thief Halfway While Arresting Him</h3>
<p>The Thief Was Very Ferocious and Struck with an Iron Bar</p>
<p>The Detective Was Seriously Injured and His Life Was in Danger</p>
<p>Yang Wende, a detective from the Huajuan class of the French Concession Police Station, lived at number 17, Quandefang, Dapufang, Dapuqiao. He had been there for many years. When Yang was returning home from work at about 1:00 a.m. yesterday, he suddenly caught sight of a thief just as he arrived at the door. The thief was prying open Yang's front door with an iron bar, trying to steal something. Seeing this, Yang tiptoed forward and captured the thief on the spot, seizing the iron bar. But Yang did not carry handcuffs with him at the time, let alone a handgun. So he held the bar in his left hand and tightly grasped the thief's collar with his right hand, intending to take him to the Lujiiawan Police Station for questioning. Unexpectedly, while passing the corner of Jinshenfu Road and Xuehuali Road, the thief suddenly had a stroke of genius. Taking advantage of Yang's unpreparedness, he suddenly turned his body and punched Yang in the left eye. Yang was caught off guard and was hit. His head hurt, his eyes blurred, and the iron bar in his left hand fell to the ground. At the same time, the thief took the opportunity to struggle hard. Yang let go, and the thief, fearing that Yang would get up and chase him, simply picked up the iron bar and struck Yang on the back of the head. At this point, Yang was unable to support himself and fell to the ground. In addition, his head and forehead hit the stone steps again, and blood flowed from the front and back of his head. The thief carried the bar and fled without a trace. A rickshaw driver happened to pass by and reported it to the postman, who reported it to the police station. The police chief immediately sent a detective to rush to the scene. After examining it, they saw that Yang was dying and unconscious. He was immediately taken to Guangci Hospital in a car. His life was in danger.</p>

All of them were public workers working together. It has been announced that the debate is over. Yesterday was the date of judgment. At 10:00 a.m., Judge Zhang Chaozuo visited the first criminal court and sentenced Lin Gen, Chen Chuncheng, Huang Puwen, and Wei Shun to five years of imprisonment, each deprived of public rights for five years.

<h3>Yesterday Was the Anniversary of the Birth of Lincoln, the Great Emancipator of Black Slaves</h3>
<p>The Twenty-Second Day is Washington's Birthday</p>
<p>Yesterday (the 12th) was the anniversary of the birth of Lincoln, the 16th President of the United States, the great man of national liberation. Celebrations were held throughout the United States. Many Americans in this city also freely held celebrations. According to reports, President Lincoln was born in Kentucky, USA in 1809. He was physically fit and was a famous athlete. Later, he studied law and politics, and became a member of parliament from a lawyer, and was honorably appointed as the 16th President of the United States from a member of parliament. He took office on March 4, 1861. He then worked hard to liberate blacks, which triggered the North-South American War. In 1865, the war stopped, and Lincoln was re-elected as president. He was assassinated and killed in Washington on April 14 of that year. Also, the 22nd of this month is the anniversary of the birth of Washington, the great president and founder of the United States. The American expatriates in this city plan to hold a celebration at the Paramount Hotel that evening.</p>
<h3>Abnormal Weather After the Start of Spring: Sha Syndrome Found in This City</h3>
<p>Mostly in Children, But Also in Adults</p>
<p>Avoid Exposure to Wind to Prevent Transmission</p>
<p>Since the beginning of spring, the weather in this city has been abnormal, causing diseases to breed. According to Pan Yuzai, director of the medical affairs department of the Zhabei Municipal Infectious Disease Hospital, although various spring epidemics have not been very rampant recently, a type of measles (commonly known as "fasazi") has suddenly been discovered in the past week. More than a dozen people have come to the hospital for treatment. According to news from the Nanshi Municipal Shanghai Hospital, three or four people have also requested hospitalization recently. Most of them are children, but there are also adults. It is said that this infectious disease, although not very life-threatening to patients, is very easy to transmit. Patients are prone to transmit it to others when they are exposed to wind and cold. The best way to prevent it is to protect patients from wind and cold. It is heard that there are only two hospitals in this city that accept this type of disease: the Municipal Shanghai Hospital and Guangci Hospital.</p>
<h3>Special Program of the Concert</h3>
<p>The Municipal Council Orchestra has arranged for the young singer Mr. P. Arnhold and the young pianist Miss W. Tomazewska to join the orchestral symphony concert this Sunday, February 17.

<h3>The South Shanghai Shelter is Extended</h3>
<p>Expenses will be Covered by the Righteous Relief Association</p>
<p>The First and Second South Shanghai Shelters, organized by the Shanghai Charity Federation, have extended their closure due to the cold weather and the fact that there are still more than 2,800 poor people staying in the shelter. According to a person in charge of the Shanlian Association, the shelter will generally continue to operate for one month. The expenses that are not enough will be requested by the chairman of the association, Wang Yiting, from the Shanghai Provincial Drought Relief Association for appropriation and subsidy. However, the members of the association are currently going to various disaster areas to provide relief and inspection. It will be after the return of Yi Deng after the abolition of the lunar half of the month that Chairman Wang will formally propose it. It is thought that a few thousand yuan is a small amount, and the righteous relief will be happy to donate generously. If there is still not enough, then ask various charities to donate.</p>

<h3>The Rent Review Committee Summoned the Landlords and Tenants of Baoxingli to Speak</h3>
<p>There are 60 single-family houses and more than 40 shops in Baoxingli, Baoxing Road, Zhabei, which were built by Tongfu Company. The monthly rent for each room ranges from 28 yuan to 38 yuan. In addition to the guarantor, the guarantor for rent arrears, and compensation, each household must also pay two months of rent as a deposit, a tip of 12 yuan, and a street cleaning fee of 6 corners of the ocean. The tenants could not bear the various burdens and immediately requested assistance from various agencies in the city in their names. Mayor Wu instructed the Shanghai Municipal Rent Dispute Review Committee to thoroughly investigate the unauthorized collection of tips and high rents and report back. The committee notified both parties to attend the meeting to speak. The landlord sent the rental accountant Ding Jifa to attend as a representative. The tenants publicly elected Hu Jianbo and Wu Fudi to attend as representatives. Hu and Wu then spoke one after another, stating that the rent was expensive, the surrounding area was deserted, the market was depressed, and it was unbearable to maintain. Moreover, the rental prices in the neighborhood were lower. The landlord originally set the price at 20 yuan to 30 yuan per building, but then saw the commercial factory start repairs, thinking it was a rare commodity, so the price suddenly increased by 8 yuan per household. Unexpectedly, the business only repaired a small part, so that the landlord was complacent and the tenants complained. To plead for it, not only would they not allow a reduction, but they hired Wang to lead his apprentices to the neighborhood to intimidate them. Moreover, the construction workers handed over the houses on December 16. How could they want to rent from December 1? They requested that the owner be ordered to return the tip and reduce the price by 20% according to the market conditions. Accountant Ding then said that the important shareholders of Tongfu Company are all in Hangzhou and cannot make decisions. Commissioner Chen said that regarding the point of renting, Tongfu Company must submit the contract for research. If the rental date is set, it will be difficult to overturn in this meeting. Regarding the unauthorized collection of tips, it is illegal and should be reported to the mayor for verification. Regarding the rent reduction part, it must be decided after an investigation of the market conditions. The representatives of both parties then resigned.</p>
<h3>Silk Dyeing Guild's Letter to Silk Fabric Association Requesting Price Adjustment</h3>
<p>The Silk and Satin Dyeing Industry Association of this city, regarding the standard dyeing prices, and the agreement signed by all parties in the silk dyeing industry, for which the higher authorities established a special project. Now that the term of the previous general meeting is coming to an end, many yarn silk businesses are not settling accounts according to the agreed dyeing prices, causing disputes. The association yesterday sent a letter to the Yarn Silk and Silk Fabric Business Association, requesting a price adjustment. The original text is recorded below:</p>
<p>To the Yarn Silk Association, Silk Fabric Business Association:</p>
<p>We hereby inform you that regarding the dyeing price agreement signed with the members of your association, our association had a special project approved by higher authorities. In October of the 22nd year of the Republic of China (1933), because your members frequently failed to settle prices according to the legally agreed dyeing price standards and arbitrarily deducted amounts, a labor strike was triggered. Subsequently, after negotiations between our association and your Silk and Satin Industry Association, four measures were agreed upon: (1) All dyeing prices shall be handled in accordance with the 16th-year treaty and the 19th-year permit; (2) The newly proposed price for Hua Jin crepe silk factory Ge is one dollar and twenty-seven cents; (3) For new patterns introduced in the future, the dyeing workshops and various factories and stores shall negotiate face-to-face at any time; (4) The Dyeing Industry Association shall be responsible for starting work on a specific date. The records of both parties' agreement are on file.</p>
<p>Now, during the period of general account closing this term, your members still occasionally have discrepancies in settling dyeing prices. In particular, the nine-fold discount on flower bubbles is suddenly reduced to an eight-fold discount, gradually squeezing and exploiting us, causing significant losses to our members. At a time when we are experiencing economic downturn and our business is teetering on the brink of collapse, being subjected to discounts makes it difficult to sustain ourselves. This matter is of utmost importance. Therefore, we are sending this letter, hoping that your association will instruct your members to deny all previous deductions of dyeing prices and short discounts on flower bubbles that were made without our association's consent. Please provide the agreed dyeing prices in full to protect our capital and maintain the difficult business environment, and please provide a date for payment in advance for notification purposes.</p>
<p>Respectfully addressed to the Yarn Silk Association, Silk Fabric Business Association.</p>

<h3>Record of the Trial of Gong Shaoting's Case of Killing His Mistress, Dismembering Her Body, and Concealing the Evidence</h3>
<p>Gong Tries to Deny, But Is Speechless After Strict Interrogation</p>
<p>The Case Is Complex; Key Witnesses to Be Summoned for Further Interrogation</p>
<p>The case of Xie Aiqiao, a woman from Changshu, being murdered by Gong Shaoting's new mistress, Gong Houshi, in collusion with Shen Fufu and others at midnight on the 21st day of the third month of the lunar calendar in the 22nd year of the Republic of China (1933), has been detailed in previous reports. The plaintiff, Xie Baolin, has now hired lawyer Song Shixiang to file a private prosecution, stating that the defendants premeditated murder, dismemberment, and concealment of evidence, and attaching a civil suit, requesting the court to seize Gong Shaoting's property.</p>
<p>The civil parents died one after another, and fortunately, the aunt Xie (named Aiqiao) raised him to adulthood. The aunt treated him like her own child. The aunt had worked as a nanny in Westerners' residences for many years and had accumulated some savings. Unexpectedly, the defendant Gong Shaoting, a small carpenter, coveted his aunt's wealth and used his cunning to become intimate with her and cohabit with her. The aunt exhausted her savings to give to Gong to run a business, sharing hardships together, and thus started a family. They built 16 factory buildings at 927 South Pier, West Baoxing Road, and opened the Gong Hongtai Construction Factory. From then on, the business developed, and tens of thousands of dollars were accumulated. Gong then became lustful, abandoned the old, and welcomed the new, becoming intimate with the young woman Houshi, completely ignoring his aunt. On April 20th of the previous year, the plaintiff suddenly saw a newspaper advertisement from the defendant Gong Shaoting searching for his aunt, claiming that she had run away with clothes and cash, and had reported to the government to investigate, etc. The plaintiff was very surprised and thought that his aunt was not young and that there might be a villain who had harmed her. However, the plaintiff had a one-thousand-yuan bank deposit book stored with his aunt, and the defendant Gong Shaoting dared to swallow it up and secretly withdraw it from the bank. Fortunately, the plaintiff stopped payment first and sued in court, where a settlement was reached after persuasion.</p>
<p>The plaintiff and the defendant Gong Shaoting each received half (Case No. 2471 in the early part of the 21st year). Since the aunt's disappearance for more than a year, the plaintiff has never forgotten his desire to investigate. Now the plaintiff has learned that the defendant and others had murdered his aunt and dismembered her body, so he reported to the police, who arrested the defendants. They confessed that the aunt was strangled to death by Gong Shaoting's mistress, Houshi's son-in-law, Shen Fufu, and that the body was buried outdoors by Gong and others in collusion with the defendants Zhou Baoquan, Li Baosheng, Liu Guisheng, etc., after bribing them. In May of last year, Gong and others, fearing that the matter was not thorough enough, bribed Zhou Baoquan and the other three again, exhumed the aunt's body, used a sharp axe to</p>
<p>Divide it into several sections and pour it with potions, move it to the back door of the new factory building for burial, intending to destroy the evidence, and secretly bury the aunt's head in the wilderness, etc. The plaintiff was shocked and horrified to learn of this. The defendant's cruel behavior is inexcusable. He requests severe punishment according to the law. The two defendants who are at large should also be wanted and brought to justice. The attached civil suit is as follows: 1. The plaintiff relied on his aunt for a living (the aunt had no children, and the plaintiff is the legal heir). The aunt had an income of 40 yuan per month, which amounts to 480 yuan per year, for a total loss of 4,800 yuan over ten years. 2. The aunt's coffin, funeral, and other expenses will cost approximately 1,000 yuan. 3. The plaintiff previously sued the defendant Gong Shaoting in</p>
<p>The deposit case (Case No. 2471 in the early part of the 21st year) for unjustly profited 450 yuan, and there is also a note for 500 yuan that the aunt lent to others, and two leather suitcases containing three leather coats and other clothing, etc. The defendant Gong Shaoting voluntarily confessed to this in the Public Security Bureau. 4. The aunt had four gold rings, a pair of gold bracelets, a gold flower, a gold hairpin, and three gold buttons, which the aunt gave to the plaintiff in her lifetime. The plaintiff requests that the defendant Gong Shaoting be ordered to compensate for the above four items of loss. Furthermore, the defendant Gong Shaoting has the entire factory building</p>
<p>Factory buildings and property of Gong Hongtai Construction Factory, located at 927 South Pier, Gongxing Road, and all the movable property in the house at 37 Shunda Lane, Keming Road, are subject to change. In order to avoid difficulties in future execution, the plaintiff also requests that they be seized together. It is learned that this case has been investigated and concluded by prosecutor Lei Binzhang of the local court. Gong Shaoting, Gong Houshi, and Shen Fufu, who are at large, are being prosecuted for crimes such as premeditated murder and destruction of corpses, while Zhou Baoquan, Li Baosheng, and Liu Guisheng, who are at large, are being prosecuted for the crime of abandoning corpses.</p>
<p>The criminal court was scheduled to open the trial on the 12th of this month. Yesterday was the due date. At 2:00 PM, Judge Zhang Shao specially opened the fifth court for trial. The plaintiff Xie Baolin and lawyer Song arrived in court one after another. The judge ordered the defendants to be brought to the case and questioned their age and origin. According to Gong Shaoting, he is 61 years old, from Gaoqiao, Pudong, and runs the Gong Hongtai Construction Factory, residing at 37 Keming Road. Gong Houshi stated that she is 41 years old, from Shanghai, residing at 37 Keming Road. Zhou Baoquan stated that he is 59 years old, from Shanghai, and works as a supervisor at the Gong Hongtai Construction Factory. Li Baosheng stated that he is 31 years old, from Jiangwan, and makes a living by farming. The judge ordered the criminals to be taken down and</p>
<p>Interrogated separately. First, Gong Shaoting was asked, "Was Xie Aiqiao your mistress?" He replied, "Yes." Asked, "How many years were you a mistress?" He replied, "Eight years." "When did she die? I don't know." Asked, "When did you start your mistress with Xie Aiqiao?" He replied, "Because her former mistress died of illness and lacked funds for burial, I paid 60 yuan to buy a coffin for her, and then we started to live together. We lived in the eight-bay house opposite the Xin Puyu Hall on Guohuo Road, Nanshi, which I owned, for about four years. Later, we moved to 973 Shanyang Road, which was also owned by me. When the January 28th Shanghai Incident broke out, we were separated." Asked, "When living on Shanyang Road, how many</p>
<p>People lived together?" He replied, "There were carpenter Guan Lin, mason Jin Fa, cook Shen Aqing, handyman Zhang Guifa, and me and Aiqiao, six people in total." Asked, "How did you meet Houshi?" He replied, "In May of the 22nd year of the Republic of China, I met Houshi in Caojiadu. At that time, Aiqiao had already left in March, and there was no one to take care of the house, so I became intimate with Houshi and lived together at 37 Keming Road." Asked, "You confessed very clearly in the Public Security Bureau that on the afternoon of March 21st, 22nd year of the Republic of China, you ordered Shen Fufu and others to strangle Xie Aiqiao with a rope. You are still trying to deny it today." Gong was speechless. Asked, "How old was Xie Jiqiao?" He replied, "She was 51 years old when she left." Asked, "When did Zhou Baoquan come to your workshop to work?" He replied, "He came on April 10th of the 22nd year of the Republic of China. By that time, Aiqiao and I had already</p>
<p>Left." Asked, "When was the house in the Daxing Road bridge area of Baoxing Road built?" He replied, "Six bungalows were built five years ago, and another eleven bungalows were built in July of the year before last and completed in October." Asked, "Who lives in the third house where the body was exhumed?" He replied, "The third house in front was a laundry room, but it soon moved away. The back was a workshop." Asked, "Zhou Baoquan confessed in the Public Security Bureau that you asked him to dig up the body and move it elsewhere." He replied, "I didn't know it was Aiqiao's body." The interrogator obtained the confession and ordered him to be taken down. Zhou Baoquan was ordered to be brought to the case and asked, "Where was Xie Aiqiao's body exhumed?" He replied, "It was exhumed behind the door of the third house at 933 Gongxing Bridge, West Baoxing Road (that is, the third house)." Asked, "Is this house newly built?" He replied, "Yes, when the house was half finished, the boss (referring to Gong Shaoting) told me to call two people to exhume the dead person's bones. That was around October. I called Li Baosheng, Liu Guisheng, etc. to dig four feet deep." Asked, "Where is the head now?" He replied, "The head was taken away by Li Baosheng and Liu Guisheng. I don't know where it was buried." Asked, "You confessed in the Public Security Bureau that Gong gave you 60 yuan as a reward afterward." He replied, "No, it was wages." Gong Houshi stated, "I used to</p>
<p>Live in Xujiahui. In late April of the 22nd year of the Republic of China, I met Gong Shaoting in Caojiadu. He was a widower, and I was a widow, so we started living together at 37 Keming Road in May." Asked, "Have you ever lived in the construction factory?" She replied, "I have never lived there." Asked, "Do you know Xie Aiqiao?" She replied, "I don't know her." Asked, "Gong Shaoting confessed very clearly in the Public Security Bureau that you and Shen Fufu and another worker strangled Aiqiao with a rope." She replied, "I have never seen Shen Fufu. It's really a miscarriage of justice." Asked, "Since it's a miscarriage of justice, why was the body exhumed below the door of the third house you mentioned? I'm afraid there is no such coincidence in the world." Gong Houshi</p>
<p>Lowers her head without saying a word. The judge orders Li Baosheng to be brought to the case and asks, "Did you dig up the body?" He replies, "I dug it up. Zhou Baoquan asked me to dig it up." Asked, "How many people dug it up?" He replies, "Me, Liu Guisheng, and Zhou Baoquan, three people. We got two yuan in wages afterward." Asked, "Since you moved the head, why did the body stay there?" He replies, "I didn't see the body at the time." Asked, "Where is the head buried now?" He replies, "Liu Guisheng went to bury it, so I don't know." At this point, the judge ordered the plaintiff Xie Baolin to go to the case and state that he is 37 years old, from Changshu, and lives at 5 Dingning Lane, Elig Road, French Concession, and</p>
<p>Works in a hotel. The deceased Xie Aiqiao is my aunt. Gong Shaoting published a notice saying that my aunt had run away. I had a dream at night and saw my aunt asking me to help her avenge her wrong." The judge obtained the confession and immediately shouted to stop him from talking nonsense. You should tell the truth about what happened." He replied, "Chen Zhangzhang told me." Asked, "How did Chen Zhangzhang know?" He replied, "He lives there and investigated it clearly. My aunt was brutally murdered, so I avenged my aunt." Asked, "Can you summon Chen Zhangzhang?" He replied, "I can bring him to the case." The judge considered the circumstances of this case to be complicated and will summon key witnesses for further trial. The defendants were returned to custody.</p>

<p>Special Feature</p>
<h3>The Two Lines Towards Japan (Continuation 3) By Lin Baisheng</h3>
<p>···After Reading Xu Daolin's "Review of Sino-Japanese Relations"···</p>
<p>On January 8th of this year, during Wang Jingwei's speech at the National Government Memorial Weekly, besides the previously mentioned role of diplomacy, there was another very important segment. He analyzed the international situation of the year extremely thoroughly, but it has not been published. Now, I am recording it below for reference. Wang stated:</p>
<p>"In my personal observation, the international situation this year indicates that Europe is safeguarding peace, while East Asia is moving down a path where peace is not guaranteed.</p>
<p>Let's talk about Europe first. The French Foreign Minister has already departed for Rome. France and Italy have been at odds since the end of the European war. There have been several times when the situations in the two countries were extremely tense. Now, the meeting of the diplomatic authorities of France and Italy, although as of now, there has been no result, there is no doubt that they are preventing deterioration and striving for improvement in the situation. If the situations of France and Italy improve, then the situations of Central European countries such as Germany, Austria, Hungary, and Czechoslovakia will inevitably stabilize. Even if there are waves, they will not be difficult to quell. Proof of this is that last year, when the Austrian Prime Minister was assassinated, the relations between Germany and Austria were very precarious. Because Italy and France had the same attitude, Germany expressed no intention of aiding Austria's internal strife, and Austria's internal strife was quelled. It is undeniable that the improvement of the situations in Italy and France is related to the maintenance of peace in Central Europe. If peace in Central Europe is maintained, then peace in Europe can also be maintained.</p>
<p>Here, we must understand that the maintenance of peace in Europe is by no means accidental. It is because the general European populace has a desire to maintain peace. Therefore, even if there are a few troublemakers and occasional opportunities for trouble, they are ultimately constrained by the general populace's desire to maintain peace and cannot succeed. Why do the general populace demand the maintenance of peace so enthusiastically and so resolutely? There seem to be two reasons for this: First, according to European history, after each major war, there must be at least hundreds of years of rest, because after a major war, the general populace suffers great pain and deep wounds. The loss of life and the consumption of property are not easily recovered. The cries of orphans and widows can be heard everywhere, from cities to villages. Therefore, the enthusiasm for the resurgence of major war is extremely weak, and the desire for peaceful rest is unbreakable. From the end of the Napoleonic Wars in 1814 to the beginning of the World War in 1914, there were a full hundred years. During these hundred years, there were certainly wars between one or two countries, or even two or three countries, but they were not common European wars. For example, the wars between Prussia and Denmark, Prussia and Austria, and Prussia and France involved only two countries. In the war between Sardinia and Austria, France under Napoleon III participated, and the Crimean War was between England and France against Russia, involving only three countries. Furthermore, the wars of the small countries in the Balkan Peninsula, although involving three or four or more countries, were all small countries. Great powers such as England, Russia, Germany, and France did not join. Therefore, it can be said that a major European war occurs once every few hundred years, and there is historical evidence for this. Second, the territories of European countries are adjacent to each other. Due to the development of transportation, their complex relations have become increasingly close. It has gradually become the case that if war breaks out, it will inevitably involve several countries. It is very rare for them to act independently. In peacetime, they are already working hard to connect with each other, so in wartime, they will naturally be like crossbows firing together. This trend has become increasingly apparent since the so-called Allied Powers and Entente Powers emerged. The above two points, one is viewed from the perspective of time, and the other is viewed from the perspective of space. Because the losses of a major war are too great and the involvement is too much, the people are averse to war, and the desire to maintain peace is therefore very urgent. Although European countries are still living under the phenomenon of armed peace, the outbreak of a major war is possible, but when it will break out and from what point it will break out, no one can say for sure. However, their efforts to maintain peace are shared by the general populace. Therefore, the government does not dare to easily be the first to start a war.</p>
<p>Let's talk about East Asia again. China currently has no so-called peace, because peace, as the name implies, must be peaceful before there can be harmony. Conversely, if there is no peace, there can be no harmony. Therefore, China currently only has so-called enduring humiliation and bearing burdens, seeking survival and planning for existence. The word peace is simply not worthy of being spoken. As for Japan, after winning the Sino-Japanese War, it obtained 200 million taels of indemnity, as well as the cession of Taiwan and the Penghu Islands. After winning the Russo-Japanese War, it inherited Russia's rights and interests in the three eastern provinces and began to expand. After winning the war against Germany, it acquired the rights and interests lost by Germany in Shandong. As a result of a war every ten years, it gained more benefits and less suffering. Moreover, among the three wars, only the Russo-Japanese War can be considered to have involved greater sacrifices and a heavier price. However, it still cannot be compared with the sacrifices and prices paid during the European war. As for the Sino-Japanese War, as a result of the corruption of the Manchurian government, it did not require much effort. As for the war against Germany, it only captured Jiaozhou Bay, and the sacrifices were even more minor. Since the general populace has tasted the sweetness of war and has not tasted the bitterness of war, they naturally do not feel that war is a hateful thing. They even believe that all problems are resolved by war, which is more pleasant than resolving them through peaceful means. In addition, the relations in East Asia are not as complex as those in Europe, because Europe first has several great powers, whose strengths are evenly matched and confront each other. There are also many small powers interspersed among them, whose tendency to obey or disobey has a significant impact at any time. In peacetime, the relations are complex, and they are wary of each other and restrain each other. During wartime, the concurrency is so abrupt that it cannot be stopped. East Asia is now almost only China and Japan. Although Russia is adjacent, the distance is far. Although England, France, and the United States have various economic and trade relations with East Asia, they are far less intertwined and closely related than in Europe. Therefore, countries in Europe strive to maintain peace, while in East Asia, although the concern is the same, the degree of effort is very different. The psychology of warmongering is so strong, and the efforts to maintain peace are so weak. Therefore, the future of peace in East Asia cannot be compared with that of Europe.</p>
<p>In recent events, Japan's withdrawal from the League of Nations will be completed in March of this year. Japan has already notified the termination of the Washington Nine-Power Treaty at the end of December last year. The two guarantees for maintaining peace no longer exist. Therefore, it can be said that there is no guarantee of peace in East Asia.</p>
<p>Some people say that the significance of the Washington Nine-Power Treaty lies in respecting and maintaining the independence and integrity of China's sovereignty and territory, and especially in naval reduction. If England and the United States are united, Japan will definitely have to yield. Not only that, but the naval power of England and the United States can also defeat Japan at any time. Of course, there is no doubt that the power of England and the United States will increase if they are united, but we must also analyze it. First, if England and the United States unite to use naval power against Japan, then Japan will inevitably take a defensive stance. The naval numbers of England and the United States are certainly stronger than Japan's, but the numbers required for an offensive are also greater than those for a defensive stance. Second, the British navy must first maintain its authority in the Mediterranean Sea, its authority in the Atlantic Ocean, and its authority in the Indian Ocean, and then proceed to maintain its authority in the Pacific Ocean. It is truly a case of preparing for many things and spreading one's strength, unable to concentrate on one point. Third, the navies of various countries are now competing. For example, in a horse race, those who have already run to the first and second positions will definitely not want the third and fourth horses to take the lead. If the British and American navies attack Japan, even if they win, they will inevitably suffer some sacrifices. The navy is different from the army. It takes many days to build a warship, especially a large warship. If it is sacrificed, then the first and second seats will inevitably be given to the third and fourth. This is an inevitable concern. The above three are just examples. There are many other similar cases. The restraining power of England and the United States being united is still not absolutely certain, let alone the fact that England and the United States are not united now. Therefore, what I just said, the psychology of warmongering is extremely strong, and the efforts to maintain peace are extremely weak, is the greatest crisis in East Asia, and everyone should pay close attention to it.</p>
<p>Understanding the international situation this year and the environment in which China finds itself, we can think of a direction for our efforts." (End)</p>

<p>Education News</p>
<h3>The Ministry of Education Starts Compiling Curriculum Outlines for Universities</h3>
<p>To adapt to the University Entrance Examination in the 27th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1938]</p>
<p>After the Ministry of Education compiled and announced the curriculum standards for primary and secondary schools in general education, as well as the curriculum or teaching material outlines for normal schools and vocational schools, it began working on the curriculum for various colleges in universities for higher education last year, starting with medicine. It has already convened the Medical Education Committee several times to discuss the draft curriculum standards for medical colleges, etc. After the members revised and sorted it out, the Ministry of Education will convene another meeting soon to make the final decision. The Ministry of Education had already started the second step, which was to compile the curriculum for other colleges in universities. The Examination Yuan informed the Quanshu Conference [a conference on personnel evaluation and appointment] that universities would hold an entrance examination in the 27th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1938], and urged them to compile university curriculum standards in advance to adapt to the examination. Based on its predetermined plan, the Ministry of Education has now drafted curriculum outlines for various colleges in universities and has replied to the Examination Yuan, explaining that it is in the process of compiling the curriculum outlines. It is found that the compilation of university curriculum was already done in the 19th year of the Republic [i.e., 1930]. At that time, the detailed content of the curriculum for various subjects in universities was listed one by one, which was relatively complicated, and it was more difficult for universities to implement it. It is heard that the outlines drafted this time are more concrete and easier to implement universally.</p>
<h3>Bankruptcy of Local Education in Zhejiang Province</h3>
<p>Director Xu Shaodi of the Department of Education Eloquently Narrates the Reasons and Remedial Measures</p>
<p>Xu Shaodi, Director of the Department of Education of Zhejiang Province, reported on how to protect local education funding at the Provincial Government Memorial Weekly yesterday. He said that what he wanted to talk about today was the issue of local education funding. Due to disasters and other reasons last year, local education funding had reached the point of bankruptcy. The number of primary schools closed in various counties reached more than 1,000. In total, the counties under the three old prefectures in western Zhejiang were short of 690,000 yuan, and the eight old prefectures in eastern Zhejiang were short of more than 1.1 million yuan. It is important to note here that the funding for district-established and private primary schools is not included. Since funding is so short, most of the existing businesses cannot be maintained. Currently, more than 70 or 80 primary schools have been closed in Jiangshan, Tonglu, Dongyang, and other counties. Yuhang, Shangyu, Tangxi, Chun'an, Sui'an, and other counties also have 40 or 50 primary schools that have not been able to open. The educational funding owed by various counties is at least four or five months, and at most eight or nine months. As for the subsidy for township primary schools, Qu County has owed it for as long as three years. The personnel serving in primary schools already have a very difficult life. When they encounter this kind of double whammy, the depth of their pain can be imagined. If human beings have not lost their sympathy, they will pay close attention to these educational personnel who are suffering. The reasons why local education funding is so difficult are very complex. The total education fee in the province is about 3.3 million yuan, of which about 2.2 million yuan belongs to the land tax and school field rent. Therefore, once there is a famine and the land tax is not collected, education will be shaken. Last year's drought caused the harvest in various counties to be only 40%, and the education fee would be short by a huge 1.3 million yuan. Therefore, poor harvest is the primary reason for the shortage of education fee. Secondly, the decline of the rural areas over the years has affected the general rural economy, and various education funds have decreased accordingly. This is the second reason. The county magistrates or financial institutions in various counties often misappropriate education fees. This is the third reason. The collection of donations and taxes and the management of school property inevitably involve embezzlement or other corrupt practices. This is the fourth reason. The budget is inaccurate, the false list is too long, or the expansion is excessive, and the expenditure exceeds the amount. Therefore, the income and expenditure do not match, and it becomes more and more exhausted. This is the fifth reason. The provincial funds allocated have already been discounted twice, and now they have to be tightened, and the actual receipt is only 50%. This is the sixth reason. Various places have been ordered to abolish harsh taxes, but at the same time, there is no supplementary funding. This is the seventh reason. The local education fees in this province are as described above. If we do not take urgent measures, we will inevitably go bankrupt. On the one hand, we are shouting about popularizing education and eliminating illiteracy, but now we cannot even maintain the existing education business, which is too contradictory. I think we can only talk about emergency relief and maintenance at present. I hope that the Department of Finance can quickly transfer one million public bonds to the management committee so that the relief business can be carried out. As for the active work, I hope that all education circles in the province and all enthusiastic people from all walks of life will mobilize. 1. To ensure that education fee income is guaranteed, each county should follow the province's education fee guarantee method and try to make the education fee independent. Under the principle of unified collection and unified expenditure, designate reliable income as a special fund for education fees. 2. Actively reorganize local education funds and property, strictly define management methods, so that they will not be controlled and swallowed by a few people, or used by other agencies. 3. Encourage donations to establish schools, so that words, property, and private property can be transformed into school property in large quantities. 4. Carry out education savings. There are more than 700,000 primary school students in the province. If each person saves half a yuan each year, there are more than 20,000 primary school teachers. If they save one yuan, and students and faculty members in county and municipal middle schools total about 8,000, if each person saves one and a half yuan, they can get more than 10,000 yuan, a total of more than 400,000 yuan a year. If you accumulate it for ten years, you can get more than 4 million yuan. After 50 years, it can increase to several million yuan. By then, the interest income will be enough. 5. Carry out a donation campaign to raise local education fees. Each county will carry out it separately. I think there must be many people who are happy to donate. All of this donation will be allocated as a foundation and will never be used for other purposes. The above are several ways to protect local education funding. I hope that all people in the province will rise up and strive for it. I also hope that the education sector can bravely take the lead and work together to protect this matter.</p>
<h3>General Evaluation Report of the National Labor Exhibition (5)</h3>
<p>(3) The primary school labor curriculum standards place great emphasis on utilizing local specialties and raw materials. However, there were not many such products in this exhibition. Even famous raw materials, such as Yixing's pottery clay, Jiangxi's porcelain clay, and Shandong's wheat straw, were not seen to be fully utilized to make products (except for vocational school products). Only a few types of products paid attention to utilizing local raw materials, including the stone carvings from Lai County Middle School and Shengquan Primary School in Huang County, Shandong, the bamboo products from the Second Provincial Primary School in Fujian, and the wool products from Qinghai and Gansu.</p>
<p>(4) Applying wisdom to construct objects is the most important condition in craft manufacturing. The ability of manufactured goods to innovate and change with each passing day is the product of applying this principle. There were many exhibits with this condition in this exhibition. The most prominent was the primary school in Fujian, which used a copper coin as raw material to make badges, buttons, and various small copper objects easily, which showed ingenuity. The Autonomous Primary School and Women's Vocational School in Hunan also made vases by connecting buttons, which was also very delicate. The pocket-sized surveying instrument from Xingye Middle School in Guangxi had a simple manufacturing method and a legal structure. The alarm bell from Bowei Primary School in Shandong used electricity to sound an alarm, and there was also an electric lock that used electricity to lock the door, which was quite thoughtful and practical. The Zhenshi Attached Primary School of Jiangsu Province used chicken and duck eggshells with bright, dark, strong, and light colors to embed portraits, using ordinary waste products to achieve this elegant and beautiful result, which was also innovative. The wooden weighing scale from the 15th Primary School in the provincial capital of Anhui, the wooden balance and mousetrap from the Jiangjundu Primary School in the provincial capital of Jiangxi, and the various animal models made of thin pine branches and thick pine segments by the Fifth Municipal Primary School in Hankou, Hubei, all had wonderful ideas and ingenious structures.</p>
<p>(5) There were very few inventions of teaching aids and other machinery in this exhibition. Only Ling Junping's spring abacus (Jiading Ordinary Primary School) and Gengfu's waterwheel (Huaiyin Normal School of Jiangsu Province) were still meaningful. The spring abacus invented by Ling Jun was even more of a high-quality finished product that closely met practical applications and should be encouraged.</p>
<p>(6) The scope of the primary school labor curriculum standard is very wide. Therefore, the labor skills learned by normal school students should cover the entire primary school curriculum. However, there are many problems with the implementation period, such as how to achieve this goal. It is still a problem that needs to be studied. Here, we see the basic production method samples of various crafts from Huangjiashi Primary School in Anhui and the craft composition samples from Jiaxing Middle School in Zhejiang (there are also some in other places, here are just examples). The basic production methods of the craft part of the primary school curriculum are all included. If you learn it, you can completely understand the basic methods of the entire curriculum. Therefore, the craft of normal school students can be based on the above materials as the core teaching materials, and then select toys, teaching aids, and instruments related to primary school education for application. Then, the purpose of teaching, application, and learning time can be solved.</p>
<p>(7) Although there were many teaching materials related to national defense in this exhibition, except for the national defense design of He'an Primary School in Shanghai, which was more meaningful, other schools only made a few models of cannons, guns, airplanes, and warships, which were of little value. In the future, we should pay attention to the construction of trenches, civil air defense, poison gas protection, and other supplies and models according to the students' level, so as to give students a deep impression and be more applicable.</p>
<p>(8) Various materials used in the labor science and various working processes, such as specimens, are necessary reference materials for labor teaching. However, there are no ready-made products for sale in our country at present. It all depends on the schools collecting and manufacturing them at ordinary times. The normal school labor materials should take these reference materials as an important work so that students can make their own teaching aids when they serve in primary schools after graduation. However, in this exhibition, only Jiaxing Middle School in Zhejiang and Huangjiashi Primary School collected, produced, completed, and organized according to the labor science curriculum standards, which should be rewarded.</p>
<p>(9) Very few industrial products in this exhibition were accompanied by work drawings drawn by students themselves. According to the labor teaching in our country's schools, the production of handicrafts is mostly done arbitrarily without drawing work drawings first. Therefore, before the finished product is completed, the author's intention and the form of the finished product are often unknown to others. Therefore, students not only cannot draw formal work drawings but also cannot recognize them, which has a great impact on the future of industrial improvement in our country. In the future, labor science and handicraft production should pay attention to work drawings to cultivate students' drawing and drawing recognition abilities.</p>
<p>(10) Small bamboo handicrafts are almost the most common products. It is estimated that their quantity is the crown of all products. The reason for this phenomenon is that although labor education has been repeatedly promoted by the government, the number of schools that actually pay attention to and implement it is still very small. Under this state, schools have no tool equipment to facilitate work, and families have no materials to supply for practice. Therefore, they can only use hand knives to scrape bamboo slices and carve bamboo slices. There is no other good way. Therefore, there are many bamboo products. However, these achievements, although they take a lot of effort, have very little effect. If our country wants to seek labor education and labor production, we must find ways to remedy the shortcomings in equipment.</p>
<p>(11) Stone carvings and seals seem to be works of art and should not be included in labor science teaching. Exquisite instrument models, display models, school building models, and sports models (except for those required for teaching design) are not in the minority of products. Although they have some labor value, they have no practical value. It is a pity to spend useful materials and valuable time on this kind of work. Using time-consuming and energy-intensive embroidery as teaching materials for ordinary middle schools (except for vocational schools) does not seem to be very consistent with the main purpose of labor. Sewing only pays attention to western-style single clothes and embroidered pillows, ignoring the ordinary sewing methods of ordinary shoes, hats, and cotton-padded clothes, which fails to properly adapt to the daily life of the common people. It is hoped that the sixth provision of the teaching rules in the curriculum standard will organize the teaching materials and reduce the malpractices of "fragmentation," "mixing," and "repetition." However, 80% to 90% of the products in this exhibition are still disorganized and individual objects. In terms of teaching, there is no clue of contact research to be found. In terms of production, there is no progress to be found in the practice design. This phenomenon should be improved as soon as possible. The above points are of great importance to the implementation of labor facilities and curriculum and are specially put forward for research.</p>
<p>(12) Carved pen holders and wooden screen joints were also numerous throughout the hall. Judging from their work, the time and economy spent were considerable. Considering their use, the gain is not worth the loss. In terms of its value, in addition to training clumsy and dead work spirit, there is nothing else to be taken. This type of teaching material is not very suitable. If the second labor exhibition is held, I hope not to see it again.</p>
<p>(13) Using several colored papers to cut and paste into several pictures is a teaching material in the art curriculum, but in this exhibition, some people used it to fill in the achievements of labor. This facility not only violates the curriculum standards but also has no labor value. It only wastes children's time between paste, paper, and silk. Therefore, it seems appropriate to prohibit it in the future. In addition, using colored wool threads and simple needlework to embroider pillowcases, lifting lists, and other large and small items is slightly more valuable than cutting and pasting. However, if the object is small and can be made in only two or three hours, and it is occasionally done, there is nothing wrong with it. If it is a large object, it takes the whole semester to complete it. Then, the child's body and mind are bound by the rigid work, and the harm cannot be overstated. Therefore, it also seems appropriate to limit it.</p>
<p>(14) Some of the products are very neatly made, but when you look at their forms, structures, colors, etc., it seems that they are made by one or two people. Although the product list fills in that a certain item is produced by School A, a certain item is produced by School B, a certain item is produced by primary school, a certain item is produced by normal school, and the types are similar, the forms are similar, and the structure colors are not much different, it is difficult to investigate what kind of method is used to implement teaching. After the production is completed, it is gathered and sent to the meeting. This type of product whose source is unknown can only be placed in the list of non-discussion and non-discussion during the evaluation. There are also some with good themes and good production, but the level is very different. For example, there is a warship in a certain school in a certain province. At first glance, it should be a cooperative achievement of junior high school students, but its label states that it is the achievement of a certain grade in junior primary school. This type of product, regardless of its authenticity, regardless of its merits and demerits, is also not discussed. There are also products whose style and skills are clearly from the hands of craftsmen. Even if the theme is good and the level is appropriate, it is not discussed. However, there are also those who are retained as reference products because of their good themes.</p>
<h3>(2) Sub-evaluation (in the order of display)</h3>
<p>(1) Shandong Province has many self-made teaching aids (simple physics and chemistry instruments and biological specimen models, etc.) and can use local products or rural by-products to make practical products, which are numerous and useful (stoneware, grass curtains, reed curtains, willow baskets, wheat straw hats, mountain thorn baskets, etc.). It can be seen that they can pay attention to the labor production and education of the common people and strive to implement it. But it is a pity that there are too few ordinary educational toys in its products.</p>
<p>(2) Hebei Province has many self-made teaching aids (simple physics and chemistry instruments, geographical models, building blocks, etc.) and educational toys. The achievements of metalwork are particularly good. It can be seen that each school in its products has considerable equipment, but it lacks products for the common people.</p>
<p>(3) There are many wood and bamboo works in Beijing, and most of them are small practical products. The clay sculptures of various ethnic groups' masks, with ten styles, are very good and meaningful.</p>
<p>(4) Henan Province has many good wooden practical products and toys. There are many national defense teaching aids or toys. Other teaching aids (physics, chemistry, biology, specimen models, and mechanical prototypes, etc.) are also numerous and generally applicable. The clay potting and kiln products (plain fired and glazed) are very good, but there are few products for the common people.</p>
<p>(5) Nanjing City can develop various crafts on average, so all kinds of products should be available. Among them, teaching aids and practical products are the majority. The various products in the city are novel and applicable, and there are many creative designs. In terms of teaching, it can pay attention to the design of large units and the working process. In the structure and form of various works, it can also pay attention to correctness and beauty. Especially those with national defense (such as going to the front line to design, etc.) and scientific (such as "volcano model," etc.) spirit are the most distinctive.</p>
<h3>Returned Textbooks Must Be Revised and Submitted to the Ministry for Review within the Time Limit</h3>
<p>(Nanyang, 12th) On the 12th, the Ministry of Education issued an order to all education bureaus and departments, stating that all textbooks and books that have been returned for revision by the Ministry must be revised within the six-month deadline and submitted for review. They are to be transferred to all bookstores for compliance.</p>
<h3>External Appointment of Peng Chun to Russia for Cultural Studies</h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 12th) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has sent a letter to Nankai University, inviting Professor Zhang Pengchun to go to Russia to study cultural affairs. Nankai University has agreed to grant him a two-month leave. Zhang is scheduled to take the Jin-Hu train from Tianjin on the 13th and head south, spending two days in Beijing before heading to Shanghai to board a Soviet ship with Yan Huiqing, Mei Lanfang, and others.</p>
<h3>High School Textbook Appendices Should Include Chinese and Western Terminology</h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 12th) On the 12th, the Ministry of Education issued a general order to all education departments, bureaus, and offices, requiring that all high school textbooks of various subjects must include a Chinese-Western terminology comparison table at the end of each book for inspection. It is hoped that all bookstores will be informed and instructed to comply accordingly.</p>
<h3>Fujian Province to Hold Province-Wide Scout General Inspection on May 7th</h3>
<p>(Fuzhou, 12th) The province-wide Scout general inspection is scheduled to be held on May 7th, 8th, and 9th, for three days. The Department of Education and the Provincial Party Headquarters are preparing and issuing notices to all counties in the province to prepare for participation.</p>
<h3>Science Association Holds High School Graduation Exam Awards</h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 12th) The China Association for Scientific Management will hold high school graduation examinations this summer and offer award money. Initially, this will be held in the nine provinces and cities where branch associations have been established: Zhejiang, Anhui, Hunan, Hubei, Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, and Qingdao. The top five students with the highest average scores in mathematics, physics, and chemistry will be awarded cash or prizes by the association.</p>
<h3>Hao Erkang Schedules Public Lectures Regularly</h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 12th) Hao Erkang, a newly hired American professor at Central University, is scheduled to give public lectures once a week from February 20th to April 10th. The lecture topics are: (A) International Politics, (B) American Politics, (C) Constitutional Theory and Practice.</p>
<h3>Special Commissioner for Repairing Confucius' Mausoleum and Temple to Depart for Ji'nan Soon</h3>
<p>Tang Wencong and Zhong Ling, section chiefs from the Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Education, who were dispatched to survey the Confucius' mausoleum and temple project, will depart from Beijing on the 15th and arrive in Ji'nan on the 16th. The engineering expert jointly hired by the two ministries has telegraphed, stating that he will depart after giving a lecture at Tsinghua University on the morning of the 16th and will arrive on the same day. They will jointly go to Qufu to survey the Confucius' mausoleum and temple in order to estimate the project. At the same time, the Shandong Provincial Government has dispatched secretaries from various departments to set up offices to begin construction.</p>
<h3>Sun Fuyuan Agrees with the Principles of the Ten Declarations</h3>
<p>Advocates that National Spirit Cannot Be Without a Place to Rest</p>
<p>Seeks National Revival, Most Wary of Blindly Following</p>
<p>Mr. Sun Fuyuan, Director of the Literature Department of the Chinese Association for the Promotion of Mass Education, returned to Beijing from his hometown of Shaoxing to visit relatives. When he passed through Shanghai, someone asked him what he thought of the Chinese-based cultural construction movement. He expressed his agreement, saying that he had been feeling a lot about the issue of Chinese-based culture in recent years, and had repeatedly published articles, arguing that most of his views were the same as those of the ten people. He also listed several examples to illustrate his personal views, generally saying that culture is like the customs of a nation, each with its own historical origin and its own conditions for existence. There is no need to force them to be the same, and there is no absolute standard of superiority or inferiority among various customs, nor is there any reason to imitate them blindly. As for the scope of Western culture, it only accounts for a quarter of the world's land and population. The other three-quarters of the nations, apart from the natives of Western colonies, have no obligation to follow Western culture entirely. Moreover, our country has a culture passed down for four or five thousand years, which is different from uncivilized nations, and there is no need to abandon ourselves and follow others. In short, the strengths of the West should be adopted as much as possible, and our own strengths should be brought into full play as much as possible. Our own shortcomings should be eliminated as much as possible, and the shortcomings of the West should also be avoided as much as possible. For example, the spiritual life of the French nation is almost entirely entrusted to the tightly organized Catholic Church, while in China, since the end of the Qing Dynasty, as a result of destroying temples, the spiritual life of the nation's rural farmers has had no place to rest. All foreign doctrines such as communism and anarchism are like entering a no-man's land. This cannot but blame the scholars of reform at that time for not recognizing the culture of their own country and acting rashly. We cannot but eat the consequences today. Another example is dancing. Western dancing was originally a rural custom, which was transformed into dances such as the foxtrot in the city, with clear origins and became a habit. However, it is incomprehensible that Chinese youth must also follow suit. There are countless other blind actions, and our solid culture is shelved. How can our country achieve national revival with this situation, and so on. It is said that Mr. Sun also expressed to others that after he goes north, he will do his best to promote the concretization of the ten-person declaration.</p>
<h3>Municipal Bureau of Education Schedules Academic Lectures Regularly</h3>

<p>Director Pan of the Bureau of Education Will Give the Lecture Personally</p>
<p>The Municipal Bureau of Education of this city has scheduled the sixth academic lecture to be held at 2:30 PM on February 16th at the Chinese Society of Arts and Sciences on Avenue Édouard VII. Director Pan will give the lecture personally. In addition to the municipal primary and secondary schools and social education institutions, which will attend the lecture with the number of people stipulated as usual, it is reported that the places where private primary and secondary schools can obtain listening certificates are as follows:</p>

<h3>Xue Guangqian and Wu Zhiqian Depart from Shanghai</h3>
<p>Departing for Italy Today</p>
<p>Mr. Xue Guangqian is going to Italy to study and has been commissioned by the Executive Yuan to investigate rural economics in Europe and by the China Cultural Construction Association to investigate the newspaper industry. He will depart from Shanghai on the Italian mail ship Conte Verde at 4 AM this morning. After attending the farewell party held by the various trade associations of this city last night, Mr. Xue boarded the ship at 8 PM. More than 500 people from various party, government, military, business, education, and other groups, Chinese and Western newspapers, as well as Mr. Xue's relatives and friends Wu Xingya, Pan Gongzhan, Tao Baichuan, and others, came to see him off, which was quite a grand occasion. Ms. Wu Zhiqian, Principal of Shanghai Girls' Middle School, will also travel to Italy on the same ship. It is reported that after Mr. Xue arrives in Italy, he will first visit Mr. Cilino, the son-in-law of the former Italian Minister to China, Mussolini, and then be introduced by Mr. Cilino to meet with the Italian Prime Minister to discuss the promotion of Chinese-Italian culture. It is also reported that Mr. Xue has worked in the head office of the Bank of China for many years. Before his departure, colleagues from the Central, China, Communications, and Four Banks of Shanghai, Zhejiang, Xingye, Silk, and other banks held farewell banquets to wish him well. It is also reported that all the businesses run by Mr. Xue have been entrusted to Mr. Ren Xianqun to act as his agent.</p>
<p>The primary school principals' joint celebration was held at the Daguanlou on Fourth Road to bid farewell to Wu Zhiqian, who is going to Italy for further studies. Representatives from various schools, including Feng Yixian, Chen Jicheng, Xu Zexiang, Weng Guoxun, Cui Jianwu, Xi Feiyuan, Huang Jingwan, Wang Longzhang, Zhang Lingfei, Wu Yao, and others, totaling more than 50 people, attended. During the banquet, representatives from various schools gave speeches successively, all exhorting him to pay attention to the study of Italian Fascism and the education system.

<h3>Principal Dispute at Cangxiang Elementary School in Beijing</h3>
<p>Principal Wei of Cangxiang Elementary School in Beijing took over the school amidst the chaos. In the past two years, he has reorganized and expanded the school, and the results are obvious. Last autumn, he repeatedly resigned due to illness, but it was not approved. At the beginning of this semester, he decided to leave. The bureau initially appointed a graduate of Central University to succeed him. After being instructed by Director Li and others, the candidate discussed the hiring of new and old faculty and staff with Principal Wei, and it has been approved. The faculty and staff are also working with peace of mind. Unexpectedly, after the school has been in session for a long time and everything is on track, the bureau suddenly changed the appointment and appointed Zhu to take over, denying the already appointed faculty and staff. Principal Wei argued on the grounds that the faculty and staff had no security and found it difficult to hand over the school.</p>

<h3>Black Eagles Lose to Jinan by One Point</h3>
<p>Result is 26 to 27</p>
<p>The Qingdao Black Eagles basketball team went south with their teacher for the purpose of observing ball skills. They played a total of four games in Shanghai, losing three and winning one. Their ball skills are worse than those of Furen and Guoti. Last night, the team originally arranged to play against the Pirates, but the Pirates broke the contract, so they changed to play against Jinan. The performance of both sides was not exciting at all. Xu Ting and Han Zhenyuan of Jinan did not play. In the first half, they lost 12 to 14. In the meantime, Jinan once led 12 to 8, but later surrendered because Zhang Yucai and Zhang Qingfu scored four goals in a row.</p>
<p>In the second half, the Black Eagles' performance improved slightly. Zhang Yucai's jump ball was quite effective. The guard Zhang Wencheng made several throws, all of which hit the target, and the score increased immediately. When it reached 20 to 13, Cai Yanxiong and Yin Guiren of Jinan relied on their personal struggle to catch up six points. After that, the situation became tense, and the scores fluctuated up and down. When it reached 26 to 25, the Black Eagles were still in the lead. Unexpectedly, within 20 seconds, Cai Yanxiong of Jinan made a wave throw, and the Black Eagles fell behind by one point, resulting in a record of one win and three losses. Most of the team will return north today. The remaining two or three people will stay in Shanghai temporarily for personal matters and will also return in a day or two. The battle records of both sides are recorded as follows.</p>

<h3>Guangyi Volleyball Team Revives New Drums</h3>
<p>The Guangyi Sports Association Volleyball Team participated in the last West Qing Volleyball Association Championship and achieved good results. Later, due to the return of the main player and captain Yuan Bingqiu to Hong Kong and the emphasis of most players on football games, there was no practice for a long time. Now that the West Qing Volleyball Tournament is approaching, the main cadre Huo Zhenghong has recently notified the old troops to register. The registered players include Zheng Jichang, Shen Bingcong, Feng Songqian, Zhu Jiongpei, Su Naichun, Huang Jinyuan, Huang Jinfang, Bao Lesheng, Hu Baoluo, etc., and new team members He Songjing, He Shouzhen, He Zijing, Chen Baoyi, Xu Dingzhong, etc. have been added. According to the above-mentioned new team members, most of them are former Hong Kong Hanzhong volleyball players, so the strength is even more impressive. Zheng Jichang has now been elected as the captain, and he has been working hard to practice recently. The contact address is the corner of Haining Road, North Sichuan Road, No. 878, 3rd floor, Huo Zhenghong receives.</p>

<h3>Tidbits</h3>
<p>— (Kuang Dai)</p>
<p>The term "tidbits" is very important and should not be ignored, especially in medicine, where it should be given more attention. The day before yesterday, according to Dr. Zhang: "There is a patient in my hospital who was injured in the abdomen by a knife, and the intestines and peritoneum have leaked out. After the chief surgeon performed the operation, he sent him back to his hometown, and at the same time sewed up the wound so that it would no longer leak out. However, because this person lost too much blood, the situation is very dangerous, so a drip method is used to allow the physiological saline to enter the heart drop by drop from the vein, flow back to the artery, and be used by all the tissues of the body. The effect is to replenish blood to maintain the patient's life, and it can also resist toxins. However, this method must be used properly. It is limited to a few points or drops per minute. If it is excessive, the patient will not only not benefit, but will harm his life." Is this tidbit not very important in medicine? I hope that my country's new medical colleagues will pay attention to this tidbit and not regard human life as a child's play.</p>
<h3>Collector</h3>
<p>— Zhou Xian</p>
<p>The term "collector" is very popular these days. In the past few years, I only heard people say "collecting stamps," which was quite interesting. In addition, it was only the students in the school who carried collecting boxes, collected a few plants, caught a few insects, and collected a few pieces of rock debris, and returned to the school to make some specimens of animals, plants, and minerals. It seems that I have never heard of anything else.</p>
<p>But in recent years, there are more and more people who love to collect. As far as the friends I know are concerned, there are also several who are very fond of making very systematic collections.</p>
<p>One is fond of collecting cigarette packs. He has only been collecting cigarette packs for four years, but he has already collected more than 370 kinds. His method of collecting is to go to the cigarette shop on the alley every day to ask if there are any new cigarettes on the market. If there are, he will buy a pack regardless of whether they are Chinese or foreign, expensive or cheap. Therefore, recently, when the cigarette shop has new products, they always invite him to buy them. This friend does not smoke himself, so he always asks people to smoke the cigarettes he buys, but he has this strange interest.</p>
<p>A certain gentleman is a collector of counterfeit banknotes. It is said that he has been collecting for more than ten years, but he has not collected 100 kinds. However, his interest in collecting has been the same for more than ten years and has never waned. No matter who he meets, he will ask, "Have you been cheated by any counterfeit banknotes these days?" If the newspaper publishes a piece of news about "cracking down on a counterfeit banknote organization," he will be very active in wanting to collect a fresh pattern.</p>
<p>There is also one who specializes in collecting Chinese medicine prescriptions. He has been collecting for two years, and there are already five or six hundred prescriptions in his home (one prescription per doctor). No matter who he goes to, he always inquires if anyone has been ill. If there is, he will ask for the prescription. His income and expenditure were not very generous. However, he always has to spend five or six yuan a month to ask unknown Chinese medicine doctors to prescribe prescriptions. Because of this, his wife often scolds him for being crazy and often quarrels with him, but he still collects them. He said that in three years, he can collect the prescriptions of 1,000 doctors.</p>
<h3>Wild Duck Hunting Tales</h3>
<p>— A. Yang</p>
<p>Wild ducks are another name for teal, resembling ducks but capable of high flight. They are gregarious and often inhabit lakes and marshes, as in Du Fu's poem, "Ducklings sleep beside their mother on the sand." Their plumage is beautiful, especially the males, as in Zhou Zizhi's poem, "Mallards follow the green waves." Their bodies are plump and fatty, the meat is edible and delicious, and they have abundant down feathers, light and warm, which can be used to make clothing, quilts, and bedding, making them prized items for warding off the cold.</p>
<p>My Suzhou's Dongting Lake, Sha Lake, Yangcheng Lake, and other places produce many wild ducks. Every winter, or when the spring ice first melts, many hunters make a living by hunting wild ducks. The hunting guns used by these people are called "one-eyed blunderbusses," each weighing over a hundred pounds. When hunting, they usually go in pairs, with two boats, one large and one small. They first load the gun onto the small boat, and then place the small boat on the large boat, like a lifeboat attached to a large ship. Every morning or evening, they put the gun boat into the water, with one person lying down. When they see flocks of wild ducks feeding by the lakeshore, they aim and fire the gun, obtaining dozens or hundreds of birds in one shot. The bullets are called "iron pellets." The method of making iron pellets is as follows: first, melt pig iron in a furnace, and at the same time prepare a wooden basin filled with cold water, with smooth objects like pumpkins or yams placed in the middle. After the molten iron is taken out, it is poured directly onto the pumpkins, etc. Immediately, molten sparks fly everywhere, and upon entering the cold water, they become iron pellets. The skill of the makers varies greatly; skilled makers produce perfectly round pellets, while unskilled makers produce oval or flat pellets, which are unusable. The iron pellets must be dried after being taken out of the water to prevent rusting. Their value is about seven or eight yuan per dan (unit of weight), while pig iron is only one or two yuan per dan. Comparing the above, the thickness of the profit is evident!</p>
<h3>New Benevolence?</h3>
<h3>Kerosene Can</h3>
<p>— Yan B.G.</p>
<p>The facilities in the city are more complete than those in the countryside and towns. For example, these past two days we have often heard reports of fires in various places. In the long night, when good dreams are at their peak, we are often awakened by several alarm bells from the watchtower, and at the same time we hear the clanging bells of the fire trucks rushing to the scene. If the distance is slightly closer, we hurriedly put on our clothes, walk to the balcony, and look outside, only to see the fire shining brightly, sparks flying into the dark sky, already forming a prairie fire. Cries and shouts can also be heard from afar, and my heart sometimes pounds like a frightened deer. I then turn around, put on my clothes, pull open the door, and go to the disaster site to make a pilgrimage.</p>
<p>Old, young, men, and women are all huddled next to the things they have carried out, tears streaming down their faces, staring blankly at a pile of rubble. It is truly a miserable sight!</p>
<p>But in the countryside and towns, when a fire breaks out, all one hears is the sound of kerosene cans being banged everywhere, shaking the whole town. In the cold winter season, getting up is relatively slow. Ten or so people carry a water dragon to the place where the fire is burning, set up the nozzle, assign people to pump the bellows, and assign people to fetch water. By the time the nozzle produces water, everything has already turned to ashes, and even collapsed, or one fire has even spread to dozens of homes! It is truly suffering from the lack of adequate facilities. However, every household must hang an empty kerosene can on their door in order to sleep soundly. This iron can has a kind of wonderful use: first, it can replace the fire alarm bell; second, it can prevent thieves from digging through the door, as it will fall to the ground and awaken the owner. Therefore, a kerosene can sells for three silver dollars each in the countryside and towns.</p>
<h3>Vegetable Root Flavors</h3>
<p>— Jin X.Y.</p>
<p>Vegetables are essential ingredients for dishes. Although they are available in all four seasons, they are especially good in winter. Once they have been exposed to heavy frost, their flavor becomes even more delicious. They are not only known for their palatability, but their natural nourishment is extremely suitable for the human body, which is especially rare. The following four types of vegetables are the most prominent in winter.</p>
<p>(1) Cabbage: Cabbage is a top-grade vegetable, a variant of su, which the Tang people called "broad-leaved Wu su." It is called su because it does not wither in winter and is commonly seen in all four seasons, having the qualities of a pine tree. Cabbage originally came from Jiaozhou, Shandong, commonly called Jiaocai. The soil in Shandong is loose and the weather is dry, so it was originally unsuited to the local soil and water. Later, it was cultivated by artificial means. The cabbages sold on the market today are mostly produced locally. The shape of cabbage is as follows: the leaves and stalks are both flat and broad, tightly wrapped layer upon layer, the whole forming a cylindrical shape, with the top resembling a spherical shape. The leaves are slightly yellowish. Late autumn and early winter are the times of its initial peak production. Once exposed to heavy frost, its texture becomes soft and its flavor is especially sweet. It can be cooked with fish, meat, shrimp, crab, raw fish, hot pot, etc., as an essential ingredient. When cooked with dried small shrimp (dried shrimp), it is called "golden hook cabbage." When the heart of the cabbage is stuffed with thousand-cut meat, wrapped layer upon layer, tied with netting, and cooked with chicken broth or Nanjing ham, it is called "cabbage pagoda." The freshness of its soup and the sweetness of its taste are not inferior to top-grade delicacies. There is also a type of cabbage with loose leaves, green on the outside and tender yellow on the inside, produced in western Zhejiang, with a slightly inferior taste. Furthermore, there is a type with completely green petal tips, not tightly wrapped, forming a long, oval shape, which is even less a true type of cabbage. Its nature is very stiff, difficult to cook until tender, and the taste is also vastly different.</p>
<p>(2) Plate-shaped Cabbage: It is called plate-shaped cabbage because it grows flat on the ground; it is also called collapsed cabbage. Its shape is like a basin, spread flat on the ground, not exceeding an inch in height. Its vegetable veins are very wrinkled, like folds, and the color is deep green. Once exposed to heavy frost, its taste is as sweet as licking sugar. It is best cooked and eaten, and is not available anywhere else.</p>
<p>(3) Spinach: Originally named Bolingcai, spinach is also a commonly used vegetable. It originally came from the country of Boling in the Western Regions. Its seeds first entered China during the Tang Dynasty. The leaves are alternate, slightly triangular and pointed, the stem is about five inches high, the flowers are small and yellowish-green, single-sexed, and dioecious. The root is a beautiful red color, and people jokingly call it "red-mouthed green parrot." Once exposed to heavy frost, its taste becomes even sweeter. It is an essential vegetable to serve with raw fish, so its sales are even more widespread in winter.</p>
<p>(4) Luohan Vegetable: Also known as Elan vegetable, it is an annual plant that grows in wet fields. The stem is less than a foot long, the leaves are long and oval, and the reticulated leaves grow in clusters, often up to more than a hundred petals, with the leaf base clasping the stem. In the spring and summer, it blooms with small white flowers, and the fruit is round and small, resembling a round fan shape. Luohan vegetables were previously only available in the countryside of Jiading. There were no such products locally, but recently they have also been sold in baskets in the market. It is best to pick and eat them in winter. After they have bloomed and fruited, the stems and leaves become coarse and old, and are no longer suitable for eating. The vegetable has a spicy and fragrant aroma. In lean years, people pick its stems and leaves and pickle them to make pickles, mix them with green fruit, and pack them in bottles to give to distant guests. Its taste is fragrant, sweet, and delicious. Those with a fondness for wine especially cherish it as a top-grade item.</p>
<h3>Another Column: Investiture of the Gods and the Biography of the Five Hegemons and Seven Powers</h3>
<p>— Hen Shui</p>
<p>Regarding Mr. Ren of Yanqiao Village's research on the Investiture of the Gods, I, the younger brother, have some slight views and dare to offer them for correction. Chinese chapter novels, such as Water Margin, Romance of the Three Kingdoms, and Journey to the West, have all undergone several evolutions. What is popular in society today is not their original appearance. Investiture of the Gods is one of the four great classic novels, and is no exception. As far as we know now, Investiture of the Gods seems to have originated from King Wu's conquest of Zhou. However, it does not directly inherit from it. In between, there is still a Biography of the Five Hegemons and Seven Powers. I, the younger brother, have a Qianlong edition of this book, half of which is already blurred, but the general idea can be discerned. Several sections in its first volume (ancient chapter novels have sections that are not divided into chapters; the details will be discussed separately another day) all record Jiang Ziya's assistance to Zhou in destroying Zhou, about 20,000 to 30,000 words, with no mention of Investiture of the Gods. The book has a preface by Chen Meigong. Even if it is a forgery, it must have been produced at the same time. Chen was a famous scholar with great fame in the late Ming Dynasty, while the Qing people despised and ridiculed him and would not bother to forge it. This book also has a Ming edition, with very good illustrations, now in the collection of the Peking University Research Institute Library. The book refers to the Ming Dynasty as the "Imperial Dynasty," which is conclusive evidence that it was written in the Ming Dynasty, not the Yuan Dynasty. Perhaps, the Book of King Wu's Conquest of Zhou was cut and placed at the beginning of this chapter? I, the younger brother, have not seen the Book of King Wu's Conquest of Zhou, and dare not make a definite statement. As for whether the author of Investiture of the Gods is Xu Zhonglin, it is indeed questionable, but at least this person is the reviser, like Jin Shengtan in the seventy-first chapter of Water Margin. As Mr. Ren of the village said, Xu's name is not printed at the beginning of the volume, but in the second volume. The copy I have also has the same, and I do not know the reason. Also, the characters in this book are the same as the characters in Journey to the West, such as Nezha, Yang Jian, and Cihang Daoren and Guanyin, and so on. Upon careful examination, it seems that they each have their own origins, but they have also taken stories from each other and expanded on their theories. I, the younger brother, read the Ming Dynasty's "Casual Notes from Jie'an," and learned that Journey to the West has a script for singing. Therefore, there must be many mythical novels from the Ming Dynasty that have now been lost. It is possible that Journey to the West and Investiture of the Gods have another source, which has already been lost. Now, I will tentatively propose a lineage chart of Journey to the West and Investiture of the Gods, and hope to receive corrections from experts!</p>
<p>Song Dynasty's Poetry of Tang Sanzang's Journey to the West → Script for Singing Four Journeys → Four Journeys → Wu's Journey to the West → Xu's Investiture of the Gods → Yuan Dynasty's King Wu's Conquest of Zhou → Biography of the Five Hegemons and Seven Powers → Creation Evolution → Romance of the Seven Kingdoms</p>
<h3>Records of Fleeting Fragrances from the Imperial Incense</h3>
<p>— Original by Princess Der Ling, translated by Qin S.O.</p>
<p>Can she still be optimistic when she thinks about these things? Thinking about it later, her brain nerves were obviously completely surrounded by shadows of sorrow, pain, disappointment, depression, and so on. No wonder everyone in our palace was trembling with fear, and anxiously and cautiously restraining ourselves! On this day, I actually managed to squeeze out some free time. I took advantage of this opportunity to rush to the ancient palace where Emperor Tongzhi's relics were stored. My intention was to see if the small clay rabbit with eyes and a tongue that could turn on its own, which the Empress Dowager had personally taken there a few days ago, had been returned to its original place. I searched for a long time, but could not find any trace of it. Of course, the Empress Dowager had carefully collected this treasure of Tongzhi. Presumably, when we are not with her, she cannot help but take it out to look at and caress!</p>
<p>I don't know how this day passed. Later, the night finally arrived. The heavy atmosphere of melancholy that enveloped this entire ancient palace during the day now felt even deeper and thicker! The sky seemed to be lower than usual, and people felt more difficulty breathing. What's more, a very coincidental thing happened, as if Heaven was deliberately trying to intimidate the Empress Dowager, making her wholeheartedly believe in the predictions of the two astronomers: a sudden north wind rose violently outside the palace, howling and shaking the windows, making them rattle. As dinner time approached, my service time was up, and my spirit and body both felt tired. I said goodbye to the Empress Dowager and hurried out, first leaning against the railing on a long corridor in front of our bedroom, planning to take a breath of fresh air. Unexpectedly, the purple and white lilacs were blown wildly in the air by the wind, and therefore all the unpleasant odor they possessed felt even stronger, and even made me think of the smell of death!

<h3>Financial Bulls Emerge, Gold Price Drops Again by $7.40</h3>
<p>Lowest Price $932.80</p>
<p>Large Shorts Take Advantage of Low Prices to Cover, Quite a Few to Beijing</p>
<p>Yesterday, large bullish forces emerged in the gold market, selling pressure was dense, the entire market broke through the $40 mark again, and the drop was quite severe. Large short positions took advantage of the low prices to cover, temporarily maintaining the situation. The market outlook is still weak, but the overall trend has stabilized slightly. In the early morning, overseas silver markets were flat, exchange rates fluctuated slightly, and London spot gold rose by one penny. Off-market pre-market trading opened at $43.40, but unexpectedly, there were quite a few people who took the opportunity to sell off. The chips were originally loose, lacking support, and large traders also came to supply the market, gradually falling. The Central Bank's official exchange rate announcement showed that the British and American currencies were flat, and the customs gold unit rose by 0.02%. The standard gold price was posted at $965.60, slightly lower than before. After the opening, the banks had a slight appetite for buying, and the sentiment was still flat. There was still a strong desire to buy at low prices, which allowed the price to rebound. However, large traders took advantage of the high prices to sell aggressively, and the buying side ultimately lacked strength. The $40 mark was broken. It was learned that HSBC Bank and the British and American exchange rates remained unchanged, and were struggling at the $40 mark. After that, the banks' appetite waned, Jewish merchant Qiao Zhifu wanted to sell American currency, and HSBC Sassoon was willing to sell British currency, and the downward trend began. However, because large traders took advantage of the low prices to cover short positions, there were quite a few rebounds. Unfortunately, a large amount of selling emerged aggressively, and the market situation was extremely weak. The silver equalization tax announcement showed no change, and the price continued to hover and fall to $933.90. After that, Chinese banks took advantage of the cheap prices to close out positions, and the gold market stabilized. The domestic market immediately tightened, and large traders rushed to cover positions, rebounding quickly. Ultimately, Sassoon still held forward shillings at high prices, and there were still many sources of supply. However, the market situation was slightly flat, and later presented a fluctuating state. The market opened from flat to slightly weak, and although the buying side was strong, the selling side gained the upper hand. The initial report for Indian silver was down by one anna, gradually rising after being low, and the banks took advantage of the high prices to continue holding positions. The selling pressure was still difficult to eliminate, and the downward trend began again. Finally, sentiment stabilized, and buying at low prices surged. The second report for Indian silver was flat, and the market trend at the close was stable. The day was filled with busy trading, and many parties closed out their positions.

However, Jewish merchant Qiao Zhifu wanted to sell American currency, and HSBC and Sassoon and others were inclined to hold shillings. The process gradually loosened.

<h3>Financial Market Still Without Recovery</h3>
<p>Foreign Exchange Stays at Six Percent</p>
<p>Yesterday, February 12th, the market still lacked vitality. Discounted bills were still not being released in quantity. Although the foreign exchange discount rate was in a period of urgency, there was no increase. The opening market was still at six percent, the same as the previous day. The clearing rate included an added commission. Because there was no afternoon session, there was still no market quote. In discounted bill transactions, the morning session saw over 1.8 million in transfers, over 300,000 in new transactions, 150,000 in incoming funds, and no outgoing funds. Foreign pawnshop loans recovered 600,000, with 800,000 made. Foreign banks received over 1 million in ticket payments, over 2.6 million in various goods and foreign exchange pawnshop collateral miscellaneous payments, over 900,000 in foreign rice payments, over 500,000 in special foreign exchange payments, and 200,000 withdrawn from storage.

<p>Securities</p>
<h3>Bond Market Under Strong Manipulation</h3>
<p>23 Customs Bonds Rise Another 2.7 Yuan</p>
<p>96 Bonds Drop Alone by 1.0 Yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday at the Chinese Securities Exchange, the 23 Customs Bonds turmoil still hadn't subsided. Market changes were unusually intense, quite different from ordinary fluctuations, full of unpredictable twists and turns, and capable of the most extreme ups and downs. At the same time, the 96 Public Bonds, in the absence of rumors or ordinary conditions, unexpectedly experienced a sharp decline. Other various forms gradually shifted from low to high. The chaotic state of the market was truly rare. According to market rumors, there was still a plan to recall the 23 Customs Bonds and reissue the 24 Customs Bonds. The market frantically pushed up and suppressed prices, causing a city-wide uproar. Transactions were unusually robust. On one side, long positions flooded the market, causing a very sharp drop. On the other side, short positions were covered and prices were raised, resulting in a violent surge. Before the government has announced a formal plan, violent fluctuations are likely unavoidable. If the facts are the opposite, then a sharp advance will be followed by a rapid retreat, and a crazy decline may also be expected. Because the number of general trend-following buyers is already significant, once the line is shaken, the rush to sell will also be alarming. An investigation of the various bonds issued by the government reveals that all procedures for principal and interest payments have been reviewed and approved by the Legislative Yuan and have the nature of law. Their nature is the same as that they cannot be arbitrarily prepaid and cannot be repaid past the due date. If there is organized monopolistic trading, then the current market price is actually only about six yuan away from the face value, and it will soon be difficult to avoid a sell-off. However, the 96 Bonds have fallen for two consecutive days, a small drop of one or two yuan, which is also an unexpected move. Yesterday's events were as follows: at the opening, bond prices mostly continued to rise by small amounts of two, three, or four jiao. The 20 Customs Bonds rose by three and a half jiao due to the excessive drop the day before. The 23 Customs Bonds, starting at an initial market price of 78.50 yuan at the beginning of this month, rose another 1.5 yuan compared to the closing price the day before, reaching a maximum of eight jiao. At that time, numbers 4, 11, and 46, etc., were sold, and each group's selling pressure was very strong, plummeting to 7.2 jiao at the close. This was the trend from high to low for this month's term. When the March term opened, people's hearts turned weak, and selling pressure was extremely strong, opening at 75 yuan, a sharp drop of two yuan compared to the closing price the day before. At that time, numbers 49 (probably representing 32), 69, and 74, etc., suddenly appeared on the market, aggressively absorbing and bravely raising prices, gradually rising, and the trading was unusually lively. The rise to 78 yuan at the close of the session was inevitably criticized as manipulation. The next session opened around 4:00 PM, and bond markets mostly rebounded by one or two jiao to four or five jiao. The 23 Customs Bonds rebounded again, surging 2.7 jiao. However, number 32 had a lot of selling. Opening a position and closing it in the next session does not escape the nature of speculation. Judging from yesterday's trend, the monopolistic situation already has cracks, and those who cannot afford to receive the goods or do not have goods to deliver should not try it lightly. As a result of the market price, the 23 Customs Bonds surged about 2.7 yuan, the Complete Six rose nearly one yuan, and the 96 Bonds fell sharply again by eight jiao to one yuan. Other varieties rose and fell equally, about three or four jiao up and down. The total number of transactions was 19.91 million yuan, of which the 23 Customs Bonds accounted for 6.615 million yuan. The results of the price changes are shown in the comparative table on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan).</p>

<h3>New York Stock Market Declines More Than Rises</h3>
<p>Xinfeng Foreign Firm reports that yesterday (11th) the New York stock market was mixed and weak. Except for public utility preferred stocks, the market was extremely dull. The public utility preferred stocks rose by as much as three yuan. If the Zhongxin Public Utility Securities Company were to dissolve, the amount paid to preferred shareholders would be considerable. The bond market was stable, and small exchange stocks declined slightly and unevenly. Chicago wheat tended to weaken due to the Liverpool decline and the gold standard issue. The Liverpool market was affected by the failure of the London Pepper Bull Company. The company wanted to squeeze the pepper market, but failed due to the arrival of large quantities of pepper. As a result, three brokerage firms went bankrupt, and at least a dozen others were affected. Total trading volume for the day was 360,000 shares. The Dow Jones New York index is listed below:</p>

<h3>Increased Delivery of Cotton Yarn This Month</h3>
<p>The yarn market continues to be weak, and the downward trend is intensifying. The main reason is that there are still more than 16,000 bales of inventory in the warehouses. Most of this cotton yarn is not easy to sell off in a short time. Recently, due to the financial emergency, a certain company has been delivering the goods it previously received on a monthly basis. As a result, the market atmosphere has relaxed, and the market has tended to fall. However, there are still more than 1,000 bales of spot yarn being traded, but the market is declining. (Jin continues to fall by one yuan). In the opening market for listed yarn, each month showed signs of decline.

<h3>Listed Cotton Falls Further</h3>
<p>The cotton market is weakening, and the decline is particularly sharp. The reason is that American and Indian cotton are falling in unison, foreign exchange is faltering, and gold prices are falling further. People's hearts are inevitably frustrated by this. However, the long positions of the Tongzhou Merchants and the Tongji Company have not moved, so the surface has not seen a complete decline. However, the cotton-to-yarn price ratio is too high.</p>
<p>(Zhengbiao Down Another 3.5 Jiao) In the opening market for listed cotton, there was a clear sign of unrest. Because the Indian and American cotton markets were falling all the way, and the gold market was declining, the yarn market situation was not good. According to the market, the amount of Shanghai cotton has increased compared to last year. Just taking Lingbao cotton as an example, there were more than 50,000 pieces last year, and there are now more than 70,000 pieces. Compared to each other, it has increased by about 10,000 pieces. As a result, people's hearts are slack, and the selling wind is getting stronger. Each month fell by 1.5 to 2.3 jiao. In the afternoon, it was heard that Indian cotton had secretly fallen another 1.2 Robi, and the market atmosphere was still tired. Each month fell again by 1.5 jiao. However, the bulls still did not spit out a large amount. It was found that 1,100 dan of Mingde were sold, 1,800 dan of Yuanda, 6,200 dan of Runkang, 1,300 dan of Yuanxingchang, 600 dan of Yifeng, 800 dan of Jifeng, 1,200 dan of Dafeng, 2,600 dan of Changfeng, and 800 dan of Hengde. 4,800 dan of Yuanda, 1,900 dan of Shenchang, 4,100 dan of Yongchang, 1,100 dan of Hexing, 1,100 dan of Dafu, and 900 dan of Changhe were bought. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day are as follows:</p>

<h3>Tianjin Yarn and Cotton Are Generally Stable</h3>
<p>(Yarn Dealers' Trading is Lively) The Tianjin cotton yarn market is because it is the defunct lunar New Year. Most of the merchants have not come to Tianjin to handle goods, but the trading among the local dealers is more active than that of the merchants. However, the market atmosphere is stable. The prices of the Tianjin and Qingdao yarn markets are listed below:</p>
<p>(Including Unified Tax)</p>

Qingxi Hang bought 180 bales, Rongda bought 150 bales, and Dongmian Hang bought 247 bales. The asking price was 37 yuan, and no other transactions were made.</p>
<h3>American Cotton with Great Dullness in Demand</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the American cotton market opened. The market conditions were weak and tired, and prices fell by three to six pounds. Transactions were flat. Foreign merchants then sold off. The gold arrears payment ruling was postponed, and merchants were disappointed. In addition, Liverpool and Mumbai were both weak. The stock market and wheat were also depressed. Market prices eased further. The outbound traffic was slow, not unlike the pre-holiday atmosphere. (According to the 12th, it was Lincoln's birthday, and the American cotton market was closed.) The textile industry was extremely sluggish, and market prices were nominal. The closing price was stable, with spot prices falling by five pounds and futures falling by four to six pounds. The British cotton market was weak, with spot prices falling by three points and futures falling by one to three points. Indian cotton was initially weak due to bulls closing their positions, but later recovered due to purchases by European exporters. Pingle fell 4.5 Robi, Aumra fell 3 Robi, and Bailuoxi fell 2.5 Robi. The original telegram is recorded on the left (11th telegram):</p>

<h3>Good Spot Sales of Grain Drive 期粉 (Wheat Flour Futures)</h3>
<p>Yesterday in the wheat flour market, after the opening in the morning, each month showed signs of initial weakness followed by rising prices. The price quoted for foreign wheat from Chicago fell by about three to four jiao, and Canadian prices fell by about one jiao and six to seven fen. When the opening price was quoted, the near and distant term sentiment was slightly agitated due to the small quotation of foreign wheat. Each month fell slightly by about half a fen. After the second session, actual sales merchants, such as Tianjin and Yingkou merchants, were still diligent in purchasing spot flour. There were frequent purchases. It was heard that 120,000 to 30,000 packages had been traded within two days, and some manufacturers had reduced their vehicle departures, so the need for spot flour seemed more robust. Therefore, this month's contract weakened and then recovered. Factory sales of distant term contracts have decreased, but there are concerns about the continued settlement of foreign wheat, and buying sentiment is not strong. In the current situation, with spot flour sales still active, the distant term contracts will be in a reversed market due to the relationship with foreign wheat. As a result, this month's contract rose by 1.25 fen, the March contract rose by 7.5 fen, the April, May, and June contracts did not move, and the July contract rose by 2.5 fen.</p>
<h3>Manufacturers Have No Intention of Receiving 期麥 (Wheat Futures)</h3>
<p>Yesterday in the wheat futures market, after the opening in the morning, each month showed signs of weakening and falling prices. The price quoted for foreign wheat from Chicago fell by three to four jiao, and Canadian prices fell by one jiao and six to seven fen. Although the weather was very cold in early spring, the clear sunlight was strong, and no more spring snow was expected. Therefore, at the time of the opening price, the hearts of the contracts all appeared weak. This month's contracts were more volatile due to the manufacturers having no intention of receiving goods. The trading volume for distant contracts was small, with only one to three fen of fluctuation. When the afternoon session opened, this month's contracts were boosted by the active flour market, improving one or two fen. As for distant contracts, the exchange rate was gradually lengthening, spot foreign wheat was not expensive, Australian wheat was quoted at eight jiao and seven fen, and A wheat was quoted at about six jiao. Therefore, people's hearts were still calm. As a result, this month's contract fell by three fen, the March contract fell by two fen, and the April contract fell by one fen. Spot wheat was not purchased by factories and there were no deliveries.</p>

<h3>河下 Rice Market: Equal Arrival and Sales</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the origin of various merchants was still sparse, with only fifteen or sixteen boats arriving (a total of over 3,000 shih of goods). The sales market also suddenly turned slack. The overall situation seemed to be balanced. The prices of all thick japonica rice did not change. Although the Qingdao merchants made some movements in late rice, the quantity was only over 300 packages, and there were no ups or downs. Du Yangjian rice remained stable. Yinbianyuan rice was in a stagnant situation.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, the boats from various merchants in Hexia were numbered 21 and 22. The market appetite was slack. The prices of upper, middle, and northern japonica rice fell slightly by a jiao, while the price of Jiashan early rice and northern japonica rice of small price fell by a small number of fen. The prices of Du Jian, Ke Jian, etc. were stable. The prices of other varieties were soft.

<h3>Foreign 客秈 (Xiang Rice) Sells Actively to Mainland</h3>
<p>Fujian Province Trials Hunan Red Rice... 客秈 (Xiang Rice) Rises Five or Six Fen</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sales of foreign rice to the mainland were slightly more active. Those who had completed the purchases a few days ago were also continuing to pack. The market turned from weak to stable. 7,000 packages of Saigon rice and 1,500 packages of Siamese rice were opened. The demand from the Jiangzhe mainland was still strong. The later trend seemed to have the necessity of pushing up. However, the inventory in the market was ample, and the arrival of goods has been uninterrupted recently. Yesterday, another company's ship, the Dada Bird, imported 25,000 packages. There may be continued arrivals in the near future, so the market is not easy to rise. However, there were fewer 客秈 (Xiang Rice) in stock and arriving, and transportation was not cost-effective. Yesterday, the taste for rice was strong in the Zhejiang Mainland, Nanjing, and the local market. Currently, Fuzhou merchants are trying to run 1,000 packages of Hunan red rice. The southern situation is even more [text missing]. Nanjing, Mainland [text missing] The price has risen five or six fen compared to the previous market, it is said.</p>
<h3>South China Continues to Actively Purchase Soybean Cake</h3>
<p>Since the red [Text Missing], soybean cake [Text Missing] has been quite healthy, and the market price has already risen by five or six fen.

<h3>Sugar Market: Taikoo Sugar Drops Two Jiao</h3>

<h3>Guangbang Sugar Stores Change Silver Term</h3>
<p>Changed to Sunday to Pay Silver</p>
<p>Guangbang stores, who also operate branches of longan, are divided into two branches: Provincial City and Hong Kong. All goods sold to merchants are subject to payment terms. The payment term for Provincial City merchants is one month. For example, goods sold from the 1st to the 15th of this month must be paid for on the 14th and 15th of the following month, and those sold from the 16th to the end of the month will be paid for at the end of the following month.

This year, the silver term for Provincial City merchants, starting in February, will also follow the example of Hong Kong merchants, with silver paid on Sundays.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea Silk Business After the Holiday</h3>
<p>The exchange rate [Text Missing] outside [Text Missing] low, and Shanghai [Text Missing] people's hearts are still strong, resulting in few transactions. As for the white factory silk market, it is heard that several 洋装 (Western-style clothing) companies have transferred silk orders, and the price difference is also small. It is believed that the time is not ripe and no transactions have been made. Domestic users will have an official market after the Lantern Festival of the defunct lunar calendar. Yesterday, only ash silk and Qili, etc., had slight transactions, it is said.</p>
<h3>疋頭 (Piece Goods) Neirong Store Sales Expand Further</h3>
<p>The cloth sales were very strong yesterday. Cloth stores and silk foreign goods bureaus on this street continued to purchase large quantities. Sales of 元直貢 neirong (wool cloth), spring thin fancy cloth, and raincoat cloth were particularly numerous. Most of them were completely stamped and invoiced. The Association also negotiated a large number of smuggled goods. Anli genius Tu Yuan Zhigong was sold in 8 pieces, priced at 7 yuan 2 jiao net price.

Japanese goods, such as 3 yuan or so of thin fancy cloth, Wufeng and Feng Erhao, have sold more than 100 pieces since Hongpan.</p>
<h3>Thin Transactions of Hardware and Tin</h3>
<p>Recent transactions in tin are still not prosperous. The market situation is still bleak. Due to the financial constraints of the Shaoxing merchants, their appetite is very dull. The business in Hangzhou and Tianjin is also not active. The market is decorated only by a kind of miscellaneous tin business, so the number of goods opened is very small. The market is strong on the outside but weak on the inside due to the poor environment. Small baked tin was sold for 178 yuan, Dutch tin for 198 yuan, Fuzu tin for 195 yuan, Zheng soldering tin for 65 yuan, auxiliary soldering tin for 53 yuan, and bucket tin for 190 yuan. Compared to Hongpan, there were only a few gains and losses.</p>
<h3>Eastern White Iron Arrives in Torrents, Difficult to Sell</h3>
<p>The recent arrival of Eastern white iron is very abundant. In the Mitsubishi Osaka warehouses, there are hundreds of thousands of sheets of goods in stock. However, there are no sales, and people's hearts are very soft. Therefore, according to market standards, there is a great potential for another decline.</p>

<h3>Reminiscences of the Old Lunar New Year</h3>
<p>— Tang Tao</p>
<p>After trying my hand at writing on New Year's Day, I put down my pen for over a month. During this month, I've seen many articles, some settling accounts of the past, others hoping for the future, all generally expressing sentiments about the New Year.</p>
<p>I also want to write something, also about the New Year. Though it's already very late, it doesn't matter, since there's still the old Lunar New Year.</p>
<p>If something can be made up for, we usually don't care about being early or late. Losing money playing mahjong during the solar New Year? We think: There's still a Lunar New Year anyway. Failing to meet important guests during the solar New Year? We think: There's still a Lunar New Year anyway. Children not getting lucky money, employees not getting rest? Everyone thinks together: There's still a Lunar New Year anyway.</p>
<p>But the so-called "still a Lunar New Year" finally arrives. Playing cards, visiting, getting money, "having fun," naturally, there's another round of excitement. However, auctions, store closures, downsizing, extended hours, bounced checks; this excitement ultimately falls flat.</p>
<p>When the excitement falls flat, things usually calm down, but that's not necessarily the case in Shanghai. The New Year is, after all, something the petty bourgeoisie "can't bear to part with." We have merchants slaughtering livestock and welcoming the God of Wealth; scholars taking advantage of the holiday to hold elegant gatherings; heroes kicking women while they light firecrackers; onlookers standing by the roadside clapping and cheering. Dog racing tracks, movie theaters, taverns and tea houses, streets and alleys, betting on the favorite, guessing the dice, the New Year's gongs and drums, "Gongxi facai!" (Wishing you wealth!)</p>
<p>Shanghai, during this old Lunar New Year, is bustling.</p>
<p>The Lunar New Year in the countryside, as I remember it, was just as lively.</p>
<p>On the first day, before the east even began to turn white, we had to get up to worship heaven and earth, usually with three cups of tea, four plates of pastries, and four plates of fruit. After bowing, we set off firecrackers to open the door, and the year began like that. Then came the New Year visits, first to the family temple, then to the ancestral hall, and then to the living elders. Everyone, young and old, looked happy.</p>
<p>They were happy because they were still alive. In this era of natural disasters and man-made calamities, any commoner could die at any moment. They had actually survived another year on this difficult and hardship-filled path of life. Not only had they not died themselves, but even others were still alive, so they congratulated each other, hoping that this year would still pass smoothly, and that next year there would still be New Year's Day, they would still meet, and they would still congratulate each other.</p>
<p>Year after year, even if it was hard, they still considered it happiness.</p>
<p>When eating on New Year's Day, we usually used a round table, with the whole family sitting around it, meaning that this could win the family's reunion. They were really afraid of "wandering" and "family ruin."</p>
<p>However, they had such a premonition.</p>
<p>What created this premonition in them was the "wandering" of countless people and the "family ruin" of countless people.</p>
<p>The second and third days were still days for New Year visits, with relatives and friends coming and going, chatting intimately, and exchanging good wishes. This was really their only joy. Although there were many days to be happy throughout the year, what others celebrated together was not necessarily what they wanted to celebrate. Only this New Year was theirs. Gambling without having to avoid officials, stealing leisure without being scolded, everyone felt relaxed, free, and uninhibited.</p>
<p>The special features of the New Year were boat lanterns, horse lanterns, dragon lanterns, monks' plays, and flower drum performances, with drumming and singing, continuing until the end of the month.</p>
<p>The Lunar New Year in the countryside, as I remember it, was also bustling.</p>
<p>However, my memory was finally shattered. After this drought, the elders who received New Year greetings from their children and grandchildren last year are now nowhere to be found; the sons who paid New Year greetings to their fathers last year are now sold to nowhere; only a few starving bellies remain, struggling and crying out.</p>
<p>The New Year has arrived again, desolate, lonely, barren, the New Year is no longer theirs. Heavens, who can put on a smile again?</p>
<h3>High Altitude (2)</h3>
<p>— by Henri Barbusse, translated by Di Zhou</p>
<p>|| On the pale face of Musset, the beard was not so much silver-white as gold-white. Most of the assistants, at this time, had sad faces. The patient, placing his thin hands on the armrests of the easy chair, seemed as if he were on a throne.</p>
<p>Wealthy, idle, seducing women, all for the sake of self-devotion, regardless of his noble, keen sensibility, is often the most cruel beast. And regardless of his true spirit, he is the most lying man.</p>
<p>Now, he is aware of dying. With this supreme, nightly, gentle, melancholy voice, he is murmuring about something. It is this warm voice that causes distress to most hearts.</p>
<p>|| I am satisfied and happy, he says.</p>
<p>|| I have no wishes. I have nothing...</p>
<p>But his eyes were meeting the face of a woman standing there. He stopped talking. It was the face of a young woman he had never seen before, from the side of a relative. This face, trembling with inner emotion, gazed at him.</p>
<p>Desire? Perhaps. Or perhaps the remorse of desire. These are the same thing. Between the conflict and alternation of desire and remorse, there is an unbreakable chain linking them. Now, from his point of view, a new, living thing has appeared. The dream of love for this woman is burning strongly, strongly, inside his decaying body. But now, he has no way to touch this woman's hand. He has fallen into infinite pain. Infinite, that is the infinite sinking to the deepest bottom. And the fishing line that opens the curtain of this dream has fallen on his coffin. His heart, which had already stopped throbbing, became sad and excited again.</p>
<p>Before long, a short time passed. Like a wounded bird falling silently, he quickly weakened. After the people left, when only he and I remained, he said to me:</p>
<p>|| I made a will before, giving you the property. Afterwards, everyone forced me to write other wills. It is in this drawer. Take it and destroy it. I only regret the original will.</p>
<p>|| That won't do...</p>
<p>|| Won't do?</p>
<p>The dying man raised his marble-like forehead, his solemn profile drooping, and with beautiful, bright eyes, fixed on me motionlessly. He stared at me as motionlessly as if he were seeing a strange beast.</p>
<p>|| Follow my will. Don't give it to those people. Give it to you.</p>
<p>I could no longer say "no," and lowered my head powerlessly, my body motionless.</p>
<p>Time passed. People came in again. But the time was already late.</p>
<p>...I said to myself. How foolish is what I have done. Without thinking, I entered a mountain of treasure, and passed by without visiting. It is not I, relying on the edge of poverty, who did the useless thing of recovering the property. What a foolish thing.</p>
<p>In this way, contact with the vast space created a second nature within me. But my heart had no desire to continue to be more advanced than that kind of habit. I have fully invaded the upper levels of the world and passed by. The habit of inverting the old angles of observing things, took away from me, the throbbing of desire, all evil, even the etiquette born of strong selfishness, have disappeared completely from my sight.</p>
<p>He lost the power of understanding. His face was slightly moved by the enormous distress. ... Only sensitive to carnal desires, he who awoke several times, he was dying slowly, slowly.</p>
<h3>Dad is Unemployed</h3>
<p>— H</p>
<h3>Thoughts on Reading "Eternal Labor, Eternal Ease"</h3>
<p>— Xian He</p>
<p>Lately, because I myself am feeling the panic of unemployment, I am particularly fond of reading articles discussing unemployment. A few days ago, I read Mr. Wang Pingling's "Eternal Labor, Eternal Ease" in this publication, and I have some small thoughts, which I will now simply write out, hoping that Mr. Wang will be willing to instruct me.</p>
<p>The central idea of this article is to blame unemployment on "serious mistakes" and "undue good fortune," and these "mistakes" and "good fortune," according to Mr. Wang's meaning, are the "concept" of "eternal labor, eternal ease." If this logic is not wrong, then the unemployed masses can only blame themselves for not being able to find a job. "You are unemployed because you are lazy, not capable enough, and have no talent," Mr. Wang's opinion is exactly this. Therefore, he puts forward "three questions" to ask the unemployed masses to reflect on themselves; whether they can avoid submitting a blank paper for these three test questions. Only those who do not submit a blank paper have the hope of a "trial" for several months, otherwise you will have to be asked to go to the streets to have fun.</p>
<p>However, the fact is completely contrary to this theory. If you examine the ranks of the unemployed, there are plenty of members with both talent and learning; on the other hand, among those who enjoy high salaries and generous emoluments, there is no lack of incompetent idiots. Those scum who fantasize about eternal labor and eternal ease are not worth mentioning and deserve to be attacked, but how should Mr. Wang explain this strange phenomenon of "eternal labor" but not being able to achieve "eternal ease," or "eternal ease" but not having "eternal labor"?</p>
<p>The example Mr. Wang gives is university students. He says that "some people think that they are only allowed to endure hardship once, and after obtaining a diploma, they can enjoy it for the rest of their lives," which is of course an appropriate argument, but in fact, there are many university students who have not even obtained a "day and night" of trial, let alone "for the rest of their lives." How can Mr. Wang explain the fact that "graduation is unemployment"?</p>
<p>As for Mr. Wang's claim of one or two years of ability, one or two years of survival rights, this statement is also a bit abstract and mysterious, isn't it?</p>
<p>I think that if correcting a few wrong ideas can solve "part" of the unemployment problem, then Mr. Wang's statement at the beginning of the article that "I don't know how many organizations have been established to solve this problem, I don't know how many government orders have been changed to solve this problem, and I don't know how many celebrities and scholars have racked their brains to solve this problem" is simply incredible.</p>
<p>In fact, Mr. Wang himself also admits that this is a "difficult to solve" "social problem"!</p>
<h3>Zhong Wu (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Ouyang Shan</p>
<p>Liang Yun, who watched over the lumber in the Guang Sheng Fa Lumberyard, was a man almost fifty years old. He was short, but very robust – and in that narrow exterior was hidden a heart that was broad and honest. He had no children; he had married a wife when he was young, but she ran away after a few years. Afterwards, he lived alone, conscientiously fulfilling his responsibilities in his job, without any desires. When his wife abandoned him, he was still working as a clerk in a mountain goods store in Qinzhou that specialized in collecting wild game such as white deer, golden pheasant, and pangolins. Knowing that this would become an irreparable shame for him, he hid in a dark room and cried sadly – afterwards, he left that small city embraced by desolate mountains and the sea, working as a stoker on a steamboat, a blacksmith in a fish market, until he arrived in Guangzhou, never mentioning that he had once had a woman.</p>
<p>His character was tranquil, to the extent that he resembled a plain tile placed in a brazier of red-hot coals; it could roast a plucked hen, but it would never ignite itself. Sometimes he caught a wild dog, secretly killed it, and cooked its meat with so many sauces that the rich aroma could be smelled from twenty feet away. Then he would call many friends to eat, saying how much money he had spent on this food, and happily listened to the reactions of those people to this little lie – praise or ridicule. There was no choice of goodwill or malice, as if he had never used his will to force others, and his own lies did not harbor any ambition.</p>
<p>Zhong Wu, a burly, generous "ownerless wandering spirit" who often spoke exaggeratedly, boasting about his ability to make fools of policemen, small merchants, and landlords, and who had a shoulder injury, was staying in his small wooden hut. When the bone injury on his shoulder was slightly better, he completely forgot Liang Yun's advice. He had urged him to hide in the wooden bunk in the hut during the day, so that the storage department director would not find out that there was a stranger staying in the lumberyard, but Zhong Wu ran around with his chest out, sometimes even standing at the gate and scolding the coolies carrying wood, making others think for a moment that he was the newly appointed director.</p>
<p>Seeing Liang Yun's flustered expression when someone walked over from the distant riverbank whistling, Zhong Wu said:</p>
<p>"Isn't the director's name Jin Yao? – Fatty Hu Shou told me. What reason would a character named Jin have! He might want to hire me to work in the storage department – at least, he should know that I am useful when someone comes to steal wood." Or, rubbing his injured chest with one hand, he cunningly said: "These people, even including the boss of Guang Sheng Fa, are not golden-eyed white-browed tigers, they are just bedbugs – let them have a blood bead, and they will never bite to death. Once last year; a bunch of brothers forced me like a hunt, and I had no choice but to jump into a canal, walking half a mile underwater – later, while I was sunbathing on the embankment, I accidentally caught a bedbug – it seemed to have put on a brand new suit, coffee-colored, emitting a sparkling light. I really had never encountered a better-looking bedbug, so I immediately regarded it as a friend in need, and loved it tenderly. I put it on my arm, wanting to see with my own eyes how it sucked my blood – at that time, it really had nothing annoying about it, it didn't dare to be presumptuous at all, its gentleness and compliance simply moved me very much. I stretched out a finger to tease it, blowing it upside down with a gentle breath, and finally carefully found a safe corner in my pocket for it and put it there. After doing such a thing, the suffering of that day was almost forgotten, and my heart was much lighter!"</p>
<p>When Liang Yun curled up his nose and laughed like an old monkey, he added:</p>
<p>"So, if the one named Jin really comes, let me negotiate with him – he might still remember the smell in my pocket."</p>
<p>Liang Yun didn't like the exaggerated personality, but he could tolerate it. When Zhong Wu said that he wouldn't be awkward when speaking in front of those people, and that he would speak more fluently and richly than them, making it difficult for them to cope, he always nodded in deep conviction, smiling very kindly.</p>
<p>Zhong Wu's soul was even more burly than his body. He arrogantly trampled over lands with various different colors and smells, using force to make the things around him bow to him, and pointed his teeth at the weakest parts of all creatures. He would not use those necessary base and filthy tricks – to compensate for this shortcoming, he had to tell everyone plainly that his brutal claws were merciless.</p>
<p>Another feature of his character was a good use of humorous metaphors.</p>
<p>"You wander around in the counties of Bao'an and Dongguan, how do you tell people what your purpose is?"</p>
<p>Liang Yun would ask him this when they squatted beside the woodpile sunbathing. And when he answered, his face looked very broad, as if it made his heart feel a lot of gratitude.</p>
<p>"It depends on who it is. Sometimes I say," this is none of your business, brother," you see, there are such people in the world! Kicking me into the mud without telling me why; when I crawl in the mud, they come to question me again. You, don't say anything to them! …"</p>
<p>"But there are also honest people, who really ask you like a friend."</p>
<p>"I'll lie to him. I say I have a younger sister who was abducted, and no matter where I run, I have to find her before I give up. Then everyone cares about me, and some people even become good friends with me because of this. Actually –"</p>
<p>"You don't seem to think of her."</p>
<p>"No, she must also be happy to see me – but there is no reason that can make me have to dig her out of somewhere. It's unnecessary. She should break into her own world, or be sold to Singapore, or… In short, everywhere is vast and boundless."</p>
<p>Zhong Wu narrated some of his own unfortunate experiences in this way, as if they were just some bluffs, which, when he noticed them, could only make him laugh, and despise and feel more at ease.</p>

<h3>The Pessimism of the Commercial Market</h3>
<p>— Chui</p>
<p>According to investigations and statistics from banking circles here, the number of large and small shops that have closed down from December 11th to the 8th of this month is very large, and the commercial future is really unthinkable.</p>
<p>Indeed, in recent years, the sluggishness of the commercial market has been getting worse year by year, with a downward trend, and it is not because shops have closed down that we know the decline of the market. The closure of shops only represents the bankruptcy of a part of the commerce, and there are still many shops that want to close but cannot, and want to go bankrupt but cannot, I do not know how many. But the reason why the commercial market has been so sluggish lately is the result of the decline of the entire economic source of our country.</p>
<p>Looking at recent years, extravagance has increased daily, the countryside has gone bankrupt, there have been floods and droughts, production has lagged behind, and foreign capitalism has invaded and exploited. With these various reasons, the people have hardly any room to survive, and various enterprises have no hope of prosperity. The Shanghai market, which seems to be still prosperous on the surface, is also a reflection of the economic bankruptcy of the whole country, because the various situations in the interior are sluggish, and all the economy is concentrated in the city, so this kind of urban prosperity is actually a strong outsider and a weak insider, a fleeting scene, really like duckweed on the water, without any roots.</p>
<p>Taking the commercial side of Shanghai as an example, a large restaurant on the Great Horse Road, which is known as the commercial center, has been doing fairly well in its daily business, but according to people in the restaurant, it is losing money every day and cannot maintain it. I asked how much the rent was? The answer was three thousand five hundred taels. If we add the rent tax and electricity, it cannot be less than four thousand taels. In this way, excluding the capital interest rate, the daily rent and other expenses are not less than two hundred yuan. So if you do not make seven or eight hundred yuan a day, you cannot pay the expenses. May I ask how it is possible for a restaurant to do seven or eight hundred yuan of business every day in this sluggish situation.</p>
<p>Looking at this one family, the rest can be imagined. All kinds of trade cannot be developed, and housing expenses cannot be maintained. Even if the business situation is barely satisfactory, and the income can cover the expenses and pay the rent, it is already a fortunate thing. However, in this time when the business situation is getting worse year by year, the land price is getting higher year by year, and the rent is still expensive. This kind of deformed development is enough to promote the rapid collapse of the market. Regardless of the sluggishness of the commercial situation in recent years, even if the economy is good, it is only doing business for a few landlords. Therefore, the reason why tall buildings are being built everywhere, but no one cares about them, can also be inferred.</p>
<h3>After Losing One's Way</h3>
<p>— Mo Yan</p>
<p>"A new emperor, a new courtier," I didn't expect things to change so quickly! We finally all encountered an irreparable misfortune. So we handed over our careers to others and scattered like birds and beasts!</p>
<p>Old Lou and I didn't feel too much sadness about this unemployment, because a chicken rib life will always have a day to be abandoned, but the authorities' disposition—the disposition of planting parties and operating private interests—and the homelessness of a group of colleagues, made people feel endless resentment and sympathy.</p>
<p>Although I was constantly shouting to get out of that ghostly place, but now that I have no home to return to, I can't help but think that the past was better than today. Now what can I do? Where am I going? I look at the future with dismay, and I can't help but feel that I have nowhere to turn!</p>
<p>I blindly went to the city twice, and as a result, my hope turned to ashes. All that was in front of me was a dead end! I don't know who is playing with me, I really want to cry! I can only blame myself for not having any skills in life and perseverance in hard work. When King Xiang of Chu was defeated at Wujiang Estuary, he still had a sharp blade to end his life. This time, I can't even find a tool to commit suicide. Otherwise, when I am in a bad mood, I can still destroy myself at will, saving countless times of anxiety and hesitation!</p>
<p>In the inn, Old Lou finally decided to come up with a way out of no way. After a serious and thorough consideration, I felt that if this is also a way to guarantee future life, then there will be absolutely no people in the world who are shouting hungry all day long. I understand that Old Lou's plan is really out of his painstaking efforts to comfort me and himself. People are encouraging me and comforting me, should I have the courage to disagree and refuse in an inhumane way? This is how we decided on our goal.</p>
<p>"We have to get some money to go to the city, the city has our new hope, new life, and everything else!" This is Old Lou's plan.</p>
<p>But I didn't encounter a smooth and convenient problem to solve from east to west, as if the journey I was taking was always rugged and dangerous; in normal times, it was often easy to ask friends for some money, it was nothing, but now, when I was in urgent need, I was at a loss! The biggest reason for this, of course, must be attributed to the year-end, which is cursed by the poor.</p>
<p>People are not like human beings, running around all day, and their food, clothing, and housing have broken the routine. However, the unexpected is still a futile trek, with nothing to gain! To sum up, our poor friends are of course unable to help or have the will but not the power; friends who are slightly wealthy or have a little savings—I don't have any wealthy friends—either say that they have been financially strapped recently, or that the year-end is coming and they are unable to turn around. The words are a sentence that can be concluded: there are really few friends who can be relied on in times of need.</p>
<p>Old Lou's turban spirit is too heavy after all. In the silence of being speechless to each other, he suddenly extemporized two sentences, but they deeply touched the strings of my heart: "It is lamentable that the world is as indifferent as water, how many Guan Zhong and Bao Shu are there in ancient and modern times"!</p>
<p>Finally, with a feeling of disappointment, I ran to a friend who I was embarrassed to ask for help again. His sympathetic face and extremely sincere expression made people feel so moved that they couldn't bear to speak. He is frugal and saves on food and clothing to help friends who are poor, can I still be cruel to ask for it? However, my friend, a friend who makes people prostrate themselves! He discerned my intention and acted as a matchmaker for me, entrusting the heavens to bless me and finding a sum of money that was enough to help me out. After being ashamed, I actually got my wish, and I was not without pleasure in my heart, although the deadline was very close.</p>
<p>Like a fish getting water, I turned my head and went back to tell Old Lou this good news.</p>
<p>The two of us laughed and clapped our hands for a while, and together we carried our suitcases and rushed into the city.</p>

<h3>A FAT MAN</h3>
<p>— Bai She</p>
<p>Cold Evening</p>
<p>I walked along many deserted streets to find a bathhouse. Finally, I found a place called "Something Spring" in an alley. As soon as I entered, the hot, cheap bathhouse air rushed into my nostrils. With the enthusiastic greetings of the attendant, I finally stepped into the warm waiting room, which was seven copper coins more expensive than the one across the street. The humid air was comparable to the heating system in a grand building, making me immediately take off my coat, leaving only the clothes I wore in summer. The attendant poured me a cup of weak tea, and I took out the newspaper I had brought in my pocket to read. In this brief moment, I forgot about the thinness of my clothes and the cold I had felt wandering the streets during the day. I even lit a weak-flavored cigarette, as if I had gathered all the things I could find to put my mind at ease. Even though this place was a smelly warm spring, it was, after all, a place without cold. Just as I was about to finish this weak-flavored cigarette, an unexpected event occurred.</p>
<p>Amidst the attendant's call for "hand towels," I saw a fat man sit down next to me. Because I was leaning back, I only saw the fat man's back. Two creases had formed on the back of his head. Everyone knew that these weren't indentations. Legend has it that a person's brain weighs nine catties and eight taels, but in the fat man's case, it undoubtedly broke the record. However, his shoulders were not much wider than those of an average person, but they grew increasingly large towards the bottom. I have never entered the Louvre Museum, which is filled with famous paintings, and don't know how many layers of human figures are depicted there, but I can guess that if a Cubist painter were to paint a half-body portrait of the fat man, they would use a cone to create it. However, the head at the apex of the cone would be a wooden fish from a Buddhist temple. The attendant used a steaming hot towel to wipe him from his back to his chest. When he wiped the fat man's lower body, the fat man leaned back, and I saw his breasts. The peaks of his breasts were high and erect, just like those of a woman who had given birth, able to tremble from the vibrations of the surrounding flesh. The attendant wrapped his feet with large towels, one at a time. The fat man let him do as he pleased. His legs, which were thicker than the bodies of two children, rested on the attendant's shoulders. After carefully covering the fat man's belly and legs with towels, a foot massager began to massage his thick, short toes. Then, an exceptionally loud snore erupted from the fat man's nostrils, drawing the attention of everyone in the room. I really couldn't stand the squealing of that pig nose, so I went to the bathroom to wash.</p>
<p>After spending half an hour in the bathroom, my lungs could no longer withstand the pressure of the steam. When I returned to my seat, the fat man was still fast asleep, and all I could hear was his snoring. At this time, one of his legs was twitching violently, and the towel covering his lower body had slipped off at some point. The twitching of his leg encroached on my seat, but slapping his leg did nothing. Then, I thought of the nickname that foreigners gave us: "Sleeping Lion." At the same time, I also thought of elephants. Elephants are the largest and fattest of all beasts, but they fear a small mouse crawling into their trunk.</p>
<p>I left the bathhouse close to ten o'clock. The fat man was still asleep and showed no signs of moving. I didn't want to look back at him again, so I walked out.</p>
<h3>A Century Apart (Seen in Front of the Paramount Ballroom)</h3>
<p>— Wang Yun</p>
<h3>In a Sampan</h3>
<p>— Hua Zhi</p>
<p>Continuing the Chronicle of a Certain Year</p>
<p>The soldiers only seemed to be invading, not retreating. With the trains cut off, this small town felt like a besieged and isolated city. Although the news from those old, gray insects (spies) was all about victories, in the nights when the wind was strong, I could faintly hear the rumble of cannons.</p>
<p>The shops in the town were all closed. The produce from the fields around the town had all been sold to the army. It seemed that the war at the front would not end in the short term. The food problem for the ten to twenty thousand people inside and outside the town was becoming dangerous. Moreover, so many soldiers had to rely on this town for their food? Li Ma was constantly nagging about returning to her hometown. Her small package almost never left her wrist. Although Ah Yun had no home to return to, she also frowned every day, as if resenting me, her young master, for not finding a way to escape this tiger's den sooner.</p>
<p>Three days later, I knew that holding out was not an option. However, my entire family was living in Hangzhou to take care of my father's illness, or they might have moved away because of the war. I didn't know if they would have to detour home. If I left, we wouldn't be able to communicate with each other, and it wouldn't make sense for everyone to worry about each other. I maintained this situation for a week.</p>
<p>The army in our town was gradually becoming restless. It was clear that the front lines were losing. Ah Yun went to the town once and came back saying that the people in the town had all fled, hiring boats to go from the inner river to the sea. Li Ma forced me to leave. On the one hand, I tried my best to comfort them, and on the other hand, I also tidied up a little, preparing to leave immediately if necessary.</p>
<p>There was still no news from my father's side. Then, one day at dawn, there was rapid gunfire from the direction of the train station. It was said that a platoon of enemies had sneaked over. This urgent report shook my forcibly calmed heart. Ah Yun searched along the town river for boats, but those that had been hired to escape this tiger's den did not return. Another portion had been seized by the army to transport rice and military supplies. Finally, at the highest price, we rented a sampan that no one wanted.</p>
<p>Speaking of sampans, every winter a group of them would come to our town from afar. They were all residents from north of the Yangtze River. A boat was their entire property. They were all able to do handicrafts: sugar candies, paper flowers, clay figures. They had everything that children liked. They would always spend the spring here, making good sales before returning home. Although it wasn't spring yet, they had left early because they saw that the situation was not good. The one we hired was run by two old partners. The man was sick, and the New Year's business had been ruined by the war. They had almost sold their property. Now that they had received this good business, the couple, with tear-stained faces, greeted us three customers. But when we climbed into the cabin, a musty, fishy smell made us nauseous. Li Ma was the first to show a bad face, scolding them to set sail, completely betraying their earnest sincerity.</p>
<p>The back of the sampan was blocked with mud and bamboo strips. Their food and lodging took up the rear part of the ten-foot boat. The two boatmen stood at the bow, and the three of us sat cross-legged, occupying the remaining half. The bottom of the boat was narrow, and if we stretched our legs even a little, they would warn us that the boat would capsize. We looked at Li Ma's face, which we had never seen before. Were we secretly laughing that she regretted leaving so hastily?</p>
<p>The three of us kept our faces tight and didn't exchange a word. Only we ourselves knew the bitterness of this situation. Fortunately, we were going downstream, and the boat quickly left the town river. The green treetops on both sides of the river brushed against the boat, and a few spring birds chirped, easing the tension in our hearts.</p>
<p>I asked the boatman, and he said that it would take at least two nights on this uncomfortable boat to reach Shanghai. Since we had reached this point, I took out a cigarette to smoke and pretended that this was a unique trip, admiring the scenery around us.</p>
<p>The river was straight, and the small boat floating in the middle of the river felt as if it was stopped there. I thought that it would be great to float three large cups of wine in the moonlight. But when I looked out at the continuous fields on both sides, my cheerful heart could not imagine it that way. Where had those farmers gone? The soil was turned over, and the mud blocks were cracked like turtle shells in the sun. Why were these hereditary farmers so lazy? There was no wisp of smoke rising from the thatched houses next to the fields. A thin, weak stray dog walked alongside our boat, its hungry red eyes constantly glancing at us!</p>
<p>Then, I closed my eyes, letting the sampan take me further and further away from my hometown—that house that my father, grandfather, and great-grandfather had worked so hard to build!</p>
<h3>Morning in Winter</h3>
<p>— Wu Fei</p>
<p>Rubbing my sleepy eyes, I walked onto the street. A cold wind blew across my neck, making me shiver. The street was quiet and still, without any noise. Although the wheels of the manure cart were playing the marching song of the dawn, the people in the city were still searching for their sweet dreams in the land of slumber. The surrounding air also seemed to have fallen into a silent zone. I could even hear my own breathing very clearly. Walking onto the bridge, I exhaled a long breath into the air. A stream of misty heat came out of my mouth and dissipated into the space. Looking at the sky, I saw that it was as gray and dim as if a curtain had been stretched over it. Although there were a few clouds slowly moving, their momentum was slower than a sailboat sailing against the wind, almost imperceptible.</p>
<p>"How cold it is! This kind of winter morning is like it's about to snow!" That's right, wasn't this the coldest part of winter? It should be snowing!"</p>
<p>I thought this, keeping my head down and walking silently forward. My toes were moving in a certain direction, but I didn't care. My entire consciousness was immersed in contemplation.</p>
<p>"It's cold! The clothes on the children aren't warm enough. You have to make them a cotton-padded coat!" My wife had called me back and told me these words every time I left the house, suddenly breaking into my heart. "Yes! The children are still only wearing a thin, old garment. It's definitely not warm enough. And my wife herself is only wearing that six-year-old tattered cotton-padded jacket. How can she keep out the cold! I have to find a way to make them a new garment each to get through this winter; but, but where is the money?"</p>
<p>Walking slowly, thinking silently, my footsteps were heavy, and my heart was as still as water.</p>
<p>Finally, the sky gradually brightened, but the winter sun was still hiding in the clouds. The birds on the branches had already been startled by the passersby and had flown away with a "whoosh." I was dragging a long shadow and unintentionally wandered into the park. The withered yellow lawn was covered with a thick, white frost. The blades of grass were weighed down and hanging upside down.</p>
<p>"The frost last night was as thick as snow, no wonder I didn't sleep warmly; besides, that tattered quilt was still the one we made when we got married. Now it's hard and broken, how can it still be warm! Looking at the frost, I couldn't help but think of the cold last night, and at the same time, I also thought of wanting to make a new cotton-padded garment for my wife and children, but where can I get the money? I felt disappointed, I felt pain, "Ah! A man!"</p>
<p>I no longer had the courage to continue thinking about it, but the more I didn't want to think about it, the more the vortex of thoughts tightened in my heart. I walked to the river and heavily threw my body into an outdoor chair, stretching out my legs and lying on it, as if my whole body was paralyzed, without any strength.</p>

<h3>New Dodge Six-Cylinder Car</h3>
<p>— Fu</p>
<p>Value Exceeding Price</p>
<p>The 1935 New Dodge automobile. It is so exquisite and magnificent, its style so beautiful, and its quality so outstanding, that experts unanimously assumed its price must be high. No one believed its selling price could be so low.</p>
<p>One hundred and seventy-five discerning evaluation experts guessed the selling price of the New Dodge car. The results showed that all guesses were higher than the actual price. Some even guessed $200 to $300 more than the actual price. It is not surprising that these individuals did not guess correctly. Yet, their accuracy is still worthy of experts and is truly admirable. This is because a vehicle with such a low selling price, such ingenious design, and such robust construction is unprecedented. The New Dodge car has ninety-five fundamental improvements, making it exceptionally comfortable, economical, fast, and safe. The car captivates at first sight, as every part is beautiful and pleasing. Upon personally driving it, one is amazed by its newly invented harmonic management. Driving and handling are extremely smooth and convenient. All major driving actions, such as steering, braking, shifting, and using the clutch, are effortless and at will. Its stability and road-hugging ability during travel surpass any previous automobile. Regardless of road conditions, the New Dodge can speed along smoothly, as if gliding. Even on sharp turns, it remains safe and reliable at high speeds, with no risk of tilting or shaking. These advantages are due to the Dodge engineers' unique secret in evenly distributing weight on all four wheels.</p>
<p>What is especially commendable about the New Dodge is its unparalleled economy. The superior engine is exceptionally quiet. Its absolute reliability is a traditional Dodge feature. It reaches speeds of over eighty-five miles per hour. Gasoline consumption is particularly economical, saving fifteen to twenty cents per dollar spent. Oil consumption is also surprisingly low. In addition, the New Dodge retains all the renowned advantages of Dodge, such as the all-steel safety body, floating engine mounts, and hydraulic brakes.</p>
<p>Some say that the 1935 New Dodge car has so many features, yet its selling price is only slightly higher than that of a small car. Therefore, it is expected that people will be happy to purchase a large car to enjoy the true pleasure of driving.</p>
<h3>Current Status of the Japanese Automobile Industry</h3>
<p>— Yu</p>
<p>| Exports to Australia |</p>
<p>Although Japan is an industrial country, its heavy industry is far less developed than its small industry. Therefore, the automobile industry in Japan is still very young. Most cars in Japan come from Europe and America, and domestic production is very small. In recent years, the government and industry have paid close attention to automobile manufacturing because, while automobiles are ordinary transportation tools related to industry and commerce, they also play a very important role in military transportation. With the current perilous international situation, the Far East crisis deeply hidden, and powerful nations around the world burying their heads in expanding their military equipment, the Japanese attention to the automobile industry is naturally not an exception.</p>
<p>According to the latest Japanese automobile magazines, the current state of the Japanese automobile industry is roughly as follows. The Japanese automobile manufacturing industry, like other industries, has made significant progress. Automobile manufacturing can be divided into two areas: automobile manufacturing and parts manufacturing. Since last year, the automobile manufacturers that everyone has been longing for have been able to implement their work, greatly increasing efficiency. The emergence of new factories and the expansion of old factories have been reported frequently in newspapers in recent months. Therefore, the general public, especially those with knowledge of automobile manufacturing, are extremely surprised by its rapid progress.</p>
<p>The most noteworthy aspect of the Japanese automobile industry is its rapid progress. Compared to other industries, for every step other industries take, the automobile manufacturing industry takes ten steps. Therefore, its progress is no less than ten times greater. Some may ask, what kind of stimulus has the Japanese automobile manufacturing industry been subjected to that has allowed it to progress so rapidly? This is entirely due to the increase in domestic and foreign markets. In the past, production was simple and sales were sluggish, but now, with the daily advancement of manufacturing methods, it is no wonder that it can spread without needing promotion. Several years ago, the general public always believed that Japanese-made products requiring precise craftsmanship could not be compared with foreign goods. Later, the press broke this stereotype. Now, domestically produced products are indeed popular in the country, and foreign goods have no way to exert their competitiveness.</p>
<p>Despite many obstacles in the environment, Japanese automobile production has increased every year. In the past ten months, domestic supply has exceeded demand. Although manufacturers have been manufacturing with all their might, the result is still insufficient. Several years ago, the foreign small car market had already been caught up by Japanese-made products. Moreover, exports of various Japanese-made automobile engines are increasing day by day, and the quantity is greatly increasing. It is expected that once the factories currently under construction are completed, Japan's automobile exports will have a significant increase.</p>
<p>The reason why the Japanese automobile industry has been able to develop so rapidly is, on the one hand, due to the success of manufacturing technology and the expansion of market sales. On the other hand, it is because the automobile industry itself has not been severely affected by the economic recession. In recent years, the world economic recession has been everywhere. Although some say that signs of recovery have already emerged everywhere, who can say whether prosperity will ultimately come? Japan has naturally also been hit by this economic blow. However, why has the automobile industry been able to jump out of this circle and have unique and satisfying progress? This is naturally because only the automobile industry is new, young, and full of vigor and perseverance, and therefore able to advance rapidly.</p>
<p>Although what is seen in the Japanese market now are mostly automobiles from European and American countries, this phenomenon will not last in the near future. At present, other industries in Japan are able to surpass Europe and America, so the automobile industry will naturally not remain inferior for long. Moreover, the current automobile manufacturing technology has already caught up with Europe and America. The expansion of the automobile market is, of course, expected. Japan's automobile products have made extraordinary progress. Therefore, various parts are not only sold domestically, but are also welcomed and satisfied overseas. They are gradually sold to various parts of the world. This progress has occurred in a short period of time, so the economic recession cannot penetrate the automobile manufacturing industry. Japanese automobiles are now sold to Australia. Parts and chassis are shipped to Melbourne for assembly and undergo various tests by agents.</p>
<p>Although the above is mostly in the tone of the Japanese and may have overstated the facts, after reading it, we can also understand the Japanese perseverance and hard work, which cannot be underestimated. I am afraid that in a few years, her automobile products will be even more numerous.</p>
<h3>The Great Plan of the Ford Factory in 1935</h3>
<p>— Ying Dai</p>
<p>Spending $415 Million US</p>
<p>Increasing the Number of Employees to 87,000</p>
<p>Spending US$415,000,000 and employing 87,000 workers, with plans to produce one million or more cars throughout the year—this is the grand plan of the Ford factory for 1935. Senior officials, engineers, and statisticians at the Ford main factory spent weeks considering this ambitious plan, with thorough planning on both the production and sales fronts. They decided to spend US$415,000,000 on 6,008 automobile raw material suppliers across the United States in 1935. Under this huge expenditure, the 1,757 suppliers in Michigan alone, all directly related to Detroit, who own factories to manufacture automobile materials, are projected to spend US$300,000,000. Once this mass production plan is implemented, the Ford factory's monthly expenditure in Detroit alone will be US$6,861,000.</p>
<p>Regarding his business, someone recently discussed it with Ford, and he said, "From the perspective of the Ford factory, the recession seems to have passed." "Based on our experience, the past six months," he said, "the facts tell us that in the coming year, the business can progress." "So, in your opinion, has the recession completely passed?" Someone asked Ford. "Why, the recession will soon pass throughout the United States," he replied. "If American industrialists completely forget the spelling of the word 'recession' and continue to promote their businesses with the sound and good business spirit unique to Americans, then they can control the entire United States. Similarly, they can enable all Americans to apply their sound and good common sense."</p>
<p>The promotion of the automobile business will undoubtedly employ many unemployed workers. According to a report from the Ford factory, in the past year, many workers in Detroit and its suburbs have been waiting for the factory to hire more. In recent months, the number of employees hired has reached 55,000 at its peak. Although the number of people employed has decreased due to internal reorganization and planning, as soon as the recovery plan is launched, workers will be hired immediately. When adding workers in the future, the factory has decided to prioritize hiring old Ford factory workers and skilled workers from other Detroit factories. According to the pre-planned figures, if the total number of cars produced in the coming year reaches one million or more, then at least 87,000 workers will be employed.</p>
<p>Of this huge expenditure, as pre-planned, 164,000 vehicles will be used to directly transport raw materials, and 160,000 vehicles will be used to transport goods purchased from overseas after they arrive in the United States. The transportation costs alone, mostly railway transportation costs, will be US$74,000,000. The largest expenditure item on Ford's 1935 budget is the purchase of car bodies, which will be US$100,000,000. This expenditure is almost entirely paid to car body manufacturers in the Detroit area for the purchase of car bodies.</p>
<p>In addition, a significant expenditure is the purchase of steel and non-ferrous metals, totaling US$75,000,000. The steel supplied by Ford's own steel mill is insufficient, and the steel purchased from the open market accounts for US$53,600,000. Malleable pig iron is US$6,618,000, and white iron is US$2,683,000 (not including what is produced in River Rouge). Among the non-ferrous metals, aluminum is the most expensive, accounting for US$6,000,000, followed by bronze at US$3,600,000, lead at US$1,443,000, tin at US$1,151,000, and zinc at US$337,750.</p>
<p>The rubber industry has indeed benefited greatly from the Ford factory, because Ford's 1935 budget shows the purchase of rubber tires at US$22,500,000, and raw rubber at US$6,000,000. It is estimated that another US$32,000,000 will be spent on other raw materials used to assemble car bodies, including US$36,727,000 for fabrics, blankets, leather, and other materials used for sewing and repairing car bodies, US$11,000,000 for glass, US$4,300,000 for paint, and US$3,000,000 for the purchase of wood, including luggage boxes and packaging. The most important item in the budget is the expansion of Ford's current steel mill and the increase in power, requiring a fund of US$14,000,000 for a new factory. In addition, the purchase of Ford factory machinery, equipment, and various items requires an expenditure of US$2,500,000, plus fuel and non-productive labor (such as machine movement and window cleaning), resulting in a total expenditure of US$415,000,000 in the 1935 budget.</p>

<h3>Newly Emerging Cast Iron Alloys in Automobile Manufacturing</h3>
<p>— Rong Lin</p>
<p>In recent years, the progress of automobile manufacturing has been rapid, and the innovation of its applied materials is also remarkable. Take cast iron alloy as an example, its resistance to melting and rust, and its enhanced strength are better than steel, while the cost is much lower. Among the various materials mixed in the alloy, nickel is the most abundant. It can harmonize the components of the iron, prevent hard particles from forming, avoid disasters caused by uneven thickness, and dissipate heat easily, which is of great benefit. Other materials such as chromium, steel, vanadium, and sand are also added, each with its own use.</p>
<p>Usually, the materials added to cast iron alloy used as cylinder material are 1-1.5% nickel, 0.3-0.5% chromium, and 1.5% silicon. With this composition, when seeking the same mechanical strength as steel, its weight can be reduced by about 15%.</p>
<p>For cast iron alloy used for brake levers, 2.5-3.0% nickel, 1.5-1.8% sand, 0.4-0.6% chromium, 1.0% iron, and 2.8% carbon can be added. The amount can further increase resistance, allowing high-speed vehicles to brake suddenly without danger.</p>
<p>In the United States, rear axles and drive shafts are also mostly made of new alloys, which can obtain stronger bending and pressure resistance. For rear axles, the composition is 3-4% nickel, 1.5% silicon, and 2.5% carbon. For drive shafts, the composition is 1.1% nickel, 0.3-0.35% magnesium, 1.8-2.0% silicon, 0.3-0.25% chromium, and 3% carbon.</p>
<p>The material required for pistons has mostly been aluminum-iron alloy, but because its resistance is too great, its body is too heavy, and it is difficult to dissipate heat, it is difficult to be satisfied. There are also copper-chromium-iron combinations, but they are not very suitable due to their excessive expansion performance. The current progress is that the alloy used for pistons is iron with 1.0-2.0% nickel, 3.5% and 3.0% sand, while the one for valves is 3.8% nickel, 0.8% chromium, 1.0% carbon, 3.0% carbon, and 1.5% silicon. Then, high mechanical efficiency can be obtained, and accumulated heat can also be easily dissipated.</p>
<p>In addition, there are compositions with 0.6% vanadium, 1.5% chromium, and 0.25% carbon, which have a hardness of 850-900 Vickes, and those with 18.0% chromium and 8.0% nickel can be heated to 1000-1500 degrees Fahrenheit without any expansion. These are all advances in modern cast iron alloys.</p>

<h3>New Fuel for Automobiles</h3>
<p>— Yao</p>
<p>At a meeting of the New York branch of the Society of Automotive Engineers in September of this year, it was predicted that streamlined cars will become popular everywhere in the near future, and their speed will definitely break the record of the current new-style streamlined trains.</p>
<p>The coolant used in this high-speed car is the engine's fuel—butane and propane gas. It is said that using this new fuel doubles the compression ratio compared to using gasoline now, and the weight of the fuel can also be reduced by 20%.</p>
<p>Butane and propane have been used to cool engines in the past. Now, they are used as fuel at the same time. This allows the engine's heat dissipation and fuel consumption to be proportional to the engine speed, so it is most suitable. Moreover, this method does not take up space or increase weight, and there is no difficulty in driving.</p>
<p>The compression ratio of ordinary gasoline engines is roughly around 5:1. If propane is used, the compression ratio can be increased to 10:1. If butane is used, it can be increased to 7:1.</p>
<p>When this fuel passes through the carburetor, it has almost become a gas because it has previously absorbed engine heat. It is extremely easy to mix with air, so combustion in the cylinder can be more complete. Oil consumption can be reduced, and the production of carbon deposits can also be eliminated.</p>
<p>These two new fuels are by-products of kerosene refining. The price is not much different from ordinary gasoline. Because they evaporate very easily, transportation is more difficult, so they are only suitable for commercial use.</p>
<p>With slight modifications, ordinary gasoline car engines can be converted to use this new fuel.</p>

<h3>The Famous British Novelist Hugh Walpole in Hollywood (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Huang Tianshi</p>
<p>In "David Copperfield," he tried as much as possible to use the original dialogue from Dickens. There is only one scene in the movie that differs from the novel: he had David and Dora meet in a theater, not in David's father's office. David's father died early. The relationship with his late father was already severed. This is suspected to be an error. The original novel needs to be checked. - Editor's Note.</p>
<p>"I believe the film is a very capable work," Walpole reported.</p>
<p>Is the rumor that Charles Laughton withdrew from the film true? Did he give up playing Micawber because he "hated Dickens"?</p>
<p>"Yes, that's true," Walpole replied. "He didn't want to accept the role at first, but he agreed after my persuasion. I originally thought he could show his skills greatly. But he is not suitable for comedic roles, and he is very clear about that himself. He really hates Dickens' works, considering them too childish and too shallow."</p>
<p>What were Walpole's feelings about his first appearance on the screen?</p>
<p>"They asked me to play Vicat. It's a minor role. They filmed my scene in one day. The plot describes me preaching in church when David falls asleep in the audience. Someone spread the news that I was very flustered under the lights. This is not true. I felt completely joyful. Acting in movies is much easier than acting on stage; you won't forget your lines or lose your self-control.</p>
<p>"I hope that in the near future, we can set up a film room in our homes, like a picture room," he said. "There are many great films that we would be very willing to keep and re-watch, like 'The Birth of a Nation,' 'David Copperfield,' 'Little Women,' etc. Of course, only some works have immortal value, but our film room can store a hundred films and can plan a simpler sound projector. If movies truly have eternal value, I guarantee that this kind of development is indispensable. Then, naturally, more producers will devote themselves to making films with lasting value."</p>
<p>Walpole is preparing to return to England immediately and will come to Hollywood again this July to continue film work. Someone asked him if he wanted to write original screenplays, and his answer was "No!"</p>
<p>"The best way is to adapt other people's stories into screenplays," he replied. "You don't have to worry about your story being split up by a producer and completely changing the original meaning. Before I start writing original screenplays, I must first obtain a considerable guarantee that it can be realized according to my ideals. If producers can provide this kind of guarantee, then writers like Shaw, Wells, etc., can be spared the hesitation about writing stories for movies.</p>
<p>"I believe that writers will occupy a more important position in film production; on the one hand, a writer must also understand that he needs to cooperate commercially with the producer, director, and set designer. The most important thing is that all parties trust each other. Many films fail because the staff is not harmonious. Every atom must be absolutely harmonious; this does not mean that we have to be completely obedient; we had fierce debates about 'David Copperfield,' but everyone respected each other's opinions. Only this method can hope to produce a perfect film." (To be continued)</p>
<p>Film Reviews</p>
<h3>Review of "Cheating Cheaters"</h3>
<p>— You Jing</p>
<p>Cheating Cheaters, shown at the Great Shanghai Theater</p>
<p>This is another detective film emphasizing the suspenseful love relationship between men and women.</p>
<p>Perhaps because it was adapted from a stage play, among the many detective films without structure or plot, "Cheating Cheaters" is considered one of the better ones.</p>
<p>I am ashamed to say that I am not very familiar with the original author, Max Marcin, and it is inconvenient to say much here. Just from what is shown to us on the screen through the lens, I feel that calling Cheating Cheaters, translated as "Working Hard for My Love," a Great and Famous Stage Play is somewhat of an exaggeration.</p>
<p>The plot begins on a ship from Paris to New York. Miss Nen, the daughter of Brokden, falls in love at first sight with the young Tom on the same ship. After arriving in port, she rents a house and becomes his neighbor.</p>
<p>Both families appear to be somewhat unscrupulous at the same time, boasting about their wealth in a sneaky way and carefully investigating where the wealth lies.</p>
<p>Mr. Brok invites Tom's family to dinner, and he disguises his accomplices as servants and Miss Nen's music professor, etc. When the sumptuous banquet is over, a servant sends a blank telegram, falsely claiming that the old couple and servants have gone to Chicago. Miss Nen is left to live in Tom's house to learn music, which deepens their love under the moonlight. In the leisure time after dinner and wine, the two families' properties and secret hiding places are revealed. The drama unfolds in this ambiguous atmosphere, with each family scheming against the other. The playwright and director handle these clues quite delicately and concisely, which is commendable.</p>
<p>The plot unfolds with the two families stealing from each other. Tom and his son are tied up by the Brok family for stealing from them; and the Brok family is similarly threatened by the electricity in the Tom family's vault. Miss Nen secretly summons the police, capturing all seven or eight people from both families, and confiscates all the treasures of both families as stolen goods. At this time, the playwright tells the audience that Miss Nen is actually the detective Alice, and she pretended to be a female thief to create these disputes because she loved Tom. So she both bought a husband and solved two cases at the same time.</p>
<p>Thanks to the playwright's efforts, the convoluted plot is woven together quite skillfully. What I mentioned above as being better than the general detective films without structure and plot refers to this. Of course, what is called "good" here is not just meaningful. What we demand as meaningful things is by no means just bizarre plots and precise structures, but works that are divorced from the reflection and indication of real life.</p>
<p>Director Richard Thorpe's technique is not outstanding. The handling of the first half is still commendable, but the second half simply appears hurried, chaotic, and with no spirit infused into each character. It is only when Nen and Tom first meet that the latter lights a flint to illuminate the ornaments on her arm, in order to show his thieving nature, which is quite profound. The director also used quite a few small tricks in Nen's performance. The points of interest in the personalities and actions of Steve and Tony are also quite good.</p>
<p>Apart from a few foreshadowing settings that are not bad, the editor of the screenplay does not seem to be able to handle this stage play in terms of film art, such as the occasions where more people are contacted at the Brok family's reception and the Ball's living room. They all show a stage flavor. As for the occasions with many people from the unfolding of the case to the police station, they are simply restricted by a very deep stage form. Of course, the director is also responsible for this. However, the scene where Tony teaches Miss Nen to play the piano while discussing theft at the Ball's family is helped by the stage play.</p>
<p>The lead actress, Fay Wray, is very hardworking throughout, and her frowns and smiles imply depth and seriousness, which have the taste of a female detective, but the sassy power is still slightly insufficient. The rest all have an average amount of acting to do, and they all pass smoothly.</p>
<h3>Hu Ping Can Make Tear Gas</h3>
<p>— Qingyun</p>
<p>In the sound dialogue singing film "The Beginning of Man," directed by Shi Dongshan, Hu Ping plays Wei Heling's "woman," who is a boat girl. Because they rely on ferrying passengers across the river every day for a living.</p>
<p>When Hu Ping gave birth to her second son, because the family was poor and could not afford to raise the child, she had to reluctantly send the child to Mrs. Huang, a wealthy woman who had no children, to raise. When Mrs. Huang sent someone to pick up the child, Hu Ping watched helplessly as her own child was taken away, and could not help but cry deeply from maternal love. Yesterday, "The Beginning of Man" was filming this scene.</p>
<p>After this scene was filmed, Shi Dongshan praised her greatly because she performed very realistically, and someone asked her why so many tears flowed when she performed crying? She smiled and did not answer. The fat Chen Linshu interjected and said: "Don't you know, she can make tear gas!" (Thank you)</p>
<p>Audience Opinions</p>
<h3>After Watching "The Red Sheep Heroic Story"</h3>
<p>— Wanli</p>
<p>During this Lunar New Year, various theaters are competing to show new films, with a variety of dazzling displays, which gives us movie fans such a great feast for the eyes! The day before yesterday, I also followed the crowded audience to the Carlton to see "The Red Sheep Heroic Story."</p>
<p>"The Red Sheep Heroic Story" begins with a scene of the Jade Palace and the Red Steps, where the supreme emperor receives the greetings of hundreds of officials. This scene is very grand, expressing the past history, and the colors are extremely full. Then Hong Xiuquan and Feng Yunshan appear on the screen to meet the audience. Hong is played by Tian Fang, and Feng is played by Yan Ying. They are handsome and energetic, overflowing from their eyebrows. If we talk about casting, it is very appropriate. Hong and Feng ride horses in the countryside, with nature as the background, and the picture is beautiful and unusual, with the poetic realm of "golden-bridled horses neighing on fragrant grassland."</p>
<p>Tong Yuejuan plays a singing girl, singing in a village shop, singing the song of falling flowers and flying catkins. The bankruptcy of the countryside and the displacement of the common people are all poured out in the clear and mournful singing, with a tear in every word, which would greatly move even those with iron hearts!</p>
<p>Generally, people think that Wang Huchen is baptized by Peking Opera and nurtured in the postures and movements of the art. Once he is on the screen, he inevitably brings some Peking Opera colors. Unexpectedly, things are contrary to expectations. In this film, he plays Wei Changhui, and his expression is just right, and he is completely different from Wang Huchen seen on the stage. This is Wang Huchen's debut work, and it can also be said to be a successful work.</p>
<p>The corruption of officials and the ferocity of yamen runners are often expressed as much as possible in small actions, making people's hair stand on end with anger, which shows the director's painstaking efforts.</p>
<p>The final scene of the Taiping Army uprising, self-immolating village houses, the military song is passionate, majestic and powerful, which is unprecedented in domestic films, and the whole drama ends in an extremely tense atmosphere. Looking at the whole film, it is impeccable, promotes national spirit, and promotes revolutionary consciousness. It is a top-notch work.</p>
<p>Movie Novel</p>
<h3>David Copperfield (7)</h3>
<p>— Liu Cun</p>
<p>But once, David's aunt and Mr. Dick came to David's house for supper, and all the chaos of the family management was immediately revealed. That day, the cook got drunk, the clams were not cut open, and the clam-opening knife could not be found. Half of a leg of lamb was not baked, and half was still raw. This situation clearly showed that David's marriage to Dora was a mistake. Later, David tried to re-hire the loyal Peggotty to take care of Dora and manage the household affairs. But from beginning to end, there was no mention of being a helpmate. The most that Dora could do well was to dip the pen in the inkwell and dip some ink when David was writing.</p>
<p>But David's love remained unchanged. He continued to love her as if she were his child. Year after year passed, and his tenderness and care for Dora did not diminish at all. One night, Dora was sick. That night, Old Fisher also found David and told him that Em'ly had been found by him. Although Old Fisher still wanted revenge, he thanked God that Em'ly could be found. He also told David that Em'ly had been abandoned by Steerforth in Naples. Before Steerforth left, he told his servant to marry Em'ly.</p>
<p>Em'ly was sad about her life experience, met the wrong person, and was left as a servant, so she wanted to die. Steerforth's servant locked her in an empty room. But she eventually managed to escape. Old Fisher managed to find her. When Em'ly saw Old Fisher, she crawled at his feet and begged him for forgiveness. Old Fisher's love was ultimately great. He hugged Em'ly in his heart, and two lines of old tears could not help but flow down.</p>
<p>Although Em'ly had been found, Old Fisher was worried about another matter. He heard that since Ham lost Em'ly, he had disregarded his own life. Whenever there was a storm at sea and a ship capsized and people drowned, he always rushed to be the first to jump into the sea to rescue people. Therefore, Old Fisher asked David to rush to Yarmouth to tell Ham that Em'ly had been found and to advise him not to stake his life anymore.</p>
<p>When David arrived at Yarmouth, he saw a large group of people gathered on the beach, all talking about one thing in a panic. A broken sailing ship was floating at sea, and a person was standing on the ship struggling for life. David saw from afar that the crowd was holding Ham back, but Ham broke free from the crowd and shouted loudly: "Whoever is about to drown, I will go and save." David ran wildly forward, but before he reached the beach, Ham had already jumped into the turbulent, raging sea, desperately extending his arms and climbing left and right in the rapids, heading towards the object.</p>
<p>Ham swam closer and closer to the person struggling in the water, but with each step forward, he was pushed back by the waves. David shouted loudly on the shore, but Ham could not hear him. He fought against the waves. He overcame one wave after another, and finally the face of the person he wanted to save gradually became visible. He looked closely and it turned out to be Steerforth. Ham shouted wildly, as if he had seen some kind of demon. He raised his fist high, as if about to strike. At this moment, suddenly a big wave, like a green mountain, came crashing down, and the broken ship suddenly collapsed with a bang and sank under the waves. Then Steerforth and Ham were also rolled into the whirlpool and disappeared. The sea seemed much calmer than before. There were only a few pieces of broken wood floating there, as if what had just been broken was just a small wooden box, and it seemed that the sea had swallowed many things and two people, and had extinguished its anger and no longer showed its ferocity.
