<h3 id="c10">外滙與法幣 <a href="#c10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>昨日外滙又起空前之波瀾，晨間市况之紊亂，行市波輻之廣闊，舉不可以常理相繩。英滙縮至三辦士二五，與去年八月十一日之最短行市相埒，美滙縮至四元六人七五，則爲空前之緊價，而實際交易尙不逮此數。以　黃金之價，一漲千元，最高曾有七千元之呼聲。他如棉紗　漲二百元，每包曾達一千七百餘元之高價。現鈔之需妥既殷，貼現乃至二百三十元。銀根日緊，滙劃拆息亦提高主月息一分左右。米糧油豆之屬，無一不聞風奇貨，行盤立漲。夫究竟何故哉？蓋觀於前日夜報上海美僑要求美政府對華鞏固金融貸款之電訊，此在投機白熱之上海市塲，可知昨日必有人焉，將掀起甚大之風波，蓋投機分子，好在隔縫中看消息、恒從相反方面以論事；而時間之距離與漲落之差額，即投機分子牟利之田地也。經昨日之大變，眉飛色舞者固多，垂頭喪氣者豈少；然絕對多數之一般生活，又增加重重之負擔，一家笑，一路哭，此誠今日上海社會之寫眞也。</p>
<p>夫何謂外滙縮？曰外幣趨貴，法幣趨賤。夫外滙何爲而縮？則言人人殊。顧觀於其縮之暴也至於斯極，則可斷言絕非外幣有何突貴之眞實事由，法幣有何突賤之眞賈事由。剖析主因，無非在此經濟戰爭之中，內奸外宄播弄人心，於中漁利而已。播弄人心之焦點，在於陰損法幣，在於使法幣制度與信念之動搖。然而法幣果眞動搖乎？此在一般人之皮相，以爲外滙之一縮冉縮，即法幣之一跌再跌，非動搖而何？不動搖，何以昨日對於外滙市塲不增加外滙之供給，而一任其就市塲進出籌碼，以爲買賣，致有中英平準基金委員會不再干涉上海黑滙市塲之流言，日前美僑要求美政府出而維持之舉動。抑知此皆爲幣値論幣値，而誤以之爲法幣本身之動搖也。實則法幣本身之是否動搖，繫於法幣準備基金之是否相當。法幣準備基金之是否相當，又不能以黃金白銀滙票之多寡，而爲論斷，蓋所謂黃金白銀滙票也者，非幣材，即通貨，不足以爲貨幣之尺度。溯中國自法幣制度確立之後，法幣旣與國富融爲一片，且與國運併趨一途。申言之，中國國運之吾泰窮通，直接影響及於法幣而成爲明顯之正比例；中國在艱苦抗戰之中，斯法幣在風狂雨暴之中；中國戰勝復興，法幣亦必欣欣向榮；故謂法幣或將如第一次歐戰後之帝俄羅卜，德國馬克，等於廢紙，乃爲絕對不能想像之事。更具體言之，法幣以物產爲尺度，物產爲法幣之源泉。中國旣幸而擁有無窮盡之寳藏，又幸此次抗戰時期猶屬生產落後之農業國，蓋逈殊於百廢盡舉，百利盡興，資本產業極度發達之工商國族；故中國富力永永不毀，生生不息。以小喻大，以一喻白，蓋猶農家火燒不盡，盜刧不窮，容有靑黃不接之困，及至秋穀登塲，又是豐衣足食，苦盡甘來矣。因此之故，戰時短絀旣不足異，亦不足憂；祗要朝野協力，開發生產，則隨什均可用以覓取不盡之外幣，亦即中國法幣之準備固無虞匱乏。</p>
<p>以吾人所聞，法幣平準基金猶合必要之水準。，或以爲當局不事維持上海黑滙，即爲平準基金垂盡之表示，則又大誤特誤。蓋維持上海黑滙，正無殊齎盜以糧也。如欲打破已在榨取及方謀破壞法幣之陰謀，則一任上海外滙之自爲供求，不加維持，策之上者也，更徵往事，上二次外匯緊縮，平準會仍暗中一再予以維持，則今日之暴縮，焉知中國當局不採取適當之措置。以爲大衆稍舒物價高漲所予生活上之痛苦。即以英美之立傷言之，中國法幣本與英鎊相維繫，港滬金融又如輔車之相依，英人進忙於戰事，未遑他顧，然遠東經濟上之勢力，決不肯輕易放棄；即使英國不得不放棄矣，必有起而代之者，蓋美國無決心維持遠東之權益則已，有之，則對於中國整個經濟，決不肯作壁上觀，揆之兩次對華信用貸款，已可知美國誠意之所在。前日夜報所傳，謂美國持重，非謂美國漠視；美國對遠東，謂援華，實抑日，謂助華，實自助，固美國明達所熟知者也。</p>
<p>至於投機份子以及但保一已不顧大局之資金逃避者流，誠不知其目光何在。其意可鄙，其心可誅，其目光尤短。彼身爲中國人，財產在中國，豈逃避得盡耶？即其所有盡易爲外幣，則今日之外幣果能長此不變耶？彼所陰損者法幣，所下井投石者法幣，所不恤加以損害者法幣，然彼所資以計盈絀者猶是法幣，其愚其矛盾可及耶？抑吾人固亦不以其愚其矛盾而寬宥之爲不足道；吾人猶願警告之者：投機愈甚，逃避愈多，則所加於法幣之斲傷亦愈甚；法幣誠必有其光明之前途，然不幸而倘若遭破壞，即中國經濟元氣將受打擊；他人方日謀破壞而不得，而乃爲一般盲目的行動，自抉藩籬，予人以進攻之機會；則無論終於屹然無恙，然投機者之行爲，其性質上實屬破壞國家金融，其罪固萬無可逭者也。</p>
<p>上述數端之外，請更贅數言。近頃一般市况，凡百土貨價格隨洋貨而步漲，然土貨究屬較廉；故外滙暴縮之影響，在服用購備洋貨愈多者，受影響愈烈，凡欲力避影響者，祗須力倡土貨；此其一。上海外滙之黑市，不足以代表滙價，亦不足以代表內地，代表全國；亦即不應以上海一隅之目光與感覺以及觀念，衡量一切；此其二。抑上海不失爲國際貿易之重鎭，洋商在中國沿海，能得自由貿易者，僅存此唯一之口岸而已。若外滙頻縮不已，進口商品大貴特貴，勢非一般華人所能購買，則洋行亦將掩旗閉戶而去，此中損失，髯可計算。蓋今日上海市塲，富於國際性，則封於上海金融如何善後，如何防維，非僅中國人之事，而爲上海中外商人所應共謀應付者也。</p>

<p>倫教　首相張伯倫今日應人民之渴望、在下院陳述挪威戰局之現狀、首相請議員在渠能作詳　之陳述前稍加忍耐、因軍事計劃與運動、目下尙未完成、故不能公布也、首相曰、今日余僅能作臨時之陳述、惟余希望邱吉爾與本人或能在下週初作較詳之陳述、屆時下院無疑的必願就所得之消息辯論全問題、約在一月前、政府曾決議命少數軍隊準備一切、俾德國對挪威南部有侵略行動時、一接命令、即可登程往佔挪威西部各港、政府所計議之任何行動、皆以德國先行破壞挪威之中立爲條件、下院當然猶憶政府在三個月前曾準備遺派協約軍前往芬蘭、進抵芬蘭之可能性、端賴挪威與瑞典政府之協助、吾人因覺縱彼等對協約軍之假这予以默許、德國亦必藉口實施侵略、故曾準備軍隊、以救彼等之急、余對於此事、並未漠視、且料挪戚之特隆漢與娜西其他各港、以及斯達文格飛機塲、均有被轟炸之虞、故復另備軍隊、以期佔據以上各地、惟余須聲明者、所予此項軍隊各指揮之命令、說明僅能在一二條件之下進兵佔據、即彼等經挪威政府邀請出此、或挪威中立已被破壞是也、下院皆知派軍由陸　經過挪瑞國境、曾由該兩國政府拒絕、經過若干時期後、此項曾經集中之軍隊、大部分曾經解散、因彼等及所撥運輸彼等之船雙在他處需之也、惟在約一月前、政府決議應留少數軍隊、準備於德國對挪威有侵略行動時、一接命令、即往佔據挪威西部各港、</p>
<p>戰爭之發生</p>
<p>或有問及英國旣有此種之準備、何以德國仍能着先鞭者、此項答覆殊爲簡易、因其爲計書已久及充分周密之詭計以對付毫不疑慮及幾無軍備之人民也、吾人在許多月之前、已知德方集中運輸艦及軍隊於波羅的各海口、此項德軍更時常作登船及離船之演習、德方之正在計畫某項侵略行動雖頗顯然、但此項軍隊同時可用以進玫芬蘭瑞典挪威荷蘭英國、故不能在事先確定其將打擊何方、即使吾人早知丹麥及挪威將爲被侵略者不得該兩國之合作、亦不能防止事變之發生、但吾人深信彼等之中立將能挽救其刼運、彼　毫無戒備，亦未予吾人以將受攻擊之警吿、實則彼等從未有此疑慮也、吾人當憶及四月初間英政府決定不能再容忍德國繼續利用挪戚領海爲其獲得鐵砂及其他違禁品接濟之交通壉溝、並決定於四月八日在三處敷設水雷、逼使德方放棄此項捷徑而至海洋之上、以便加以截留、所可認爲奇異者、即英政府所決定此重大行動之四月八日、幾與德國所選定之發動日期適相巧合、</p>
<p>摧毀敵海軍</p>
<p>首相乃回述四月七日獲得情報知大批德艦向挪威西海岸移動而沿該海岸前進、並重述英檻榮譽號與德艦香霍斯特號大戰、及那維克第一次海戰之情形、接言曰、鑒於挪威中部局勢之混沌、及佔取那維克之重要吾人迅速召集之第一軍乃啟椗直赴那維克區、而於四月十五日開抵該區維時英海軍已於四月十三日進攻獲勝、完全摧毀該港之敵海軍、而使原定進佔那維克之各軍不必用及之、吾人之決定繼續行動、抱有三種目的、即（一）竭力援助挪威、（二）抵禦或阻延德軍由南面之前進、（三）便利救護挪王與挪政府是也、英軍和能佔據特隆漢、則此項目的可極迅速達到、而吾人決計努力爲之、（衆歡呼）乃於特隆漢南北擇定登陸地點兩處、余今日不能詳述英軍登陸後該兩綫之戰鬥情形、目前所能言者）爲我軍以勇敢與決心作戰、曾以重創加諸敵軍、惟該二境之協約軍現遭遇嚴重之困難、其中最重大者、厥爲凡可利用之飛機塲、已均落敵軍之手、此項困難吾人固先料及者也、職是之故、吾人遂不能利用戰鬥機數日前吾人乃知因德軍佔天空之優勢、故使吾人抵抗由南面進攻之敵軍所必需之砲隊與坦克車、皆不能運登岸上、故吾人乃於上週決定必須放棄由南面奪取特隆漢之計畫、且必須將該區軍隊撤至他處、</p>
<p>戰略的撤退</p>
<p>於敵軍之前作撤退行動、衆皆公認乃軍事中最困難之眾、但此次吾人甚屬僥倖、賴强大海軍之助、及統率該區英陸軍裴蓋特少將之決心、與我軍之勇敢機警、現已將全軍由安達爾斯納撤退、德飛機雖不斷監視、而就余所知、英軍在此舉中未折一人、</p>
<p>傷亡不重大</p>
<p>各役中我軍傷亡之數、余今尙不能告知下院、惟就戰役之規模而論、余敢信傷亡之數、並不重大、余所滿意者、我軍雖因遭遇極大之困難、不能佔得特隆鎭、但比較敵我所佔之便利、協約軍目下所佔之便利、仍優於敵軍也、</p>
<p>德目的未達</p>
<p>首相繼言德軍初望安步而入挪威、佔領其全部、今此希望已遭失敗、經三星期之戰鬥、敵軍於陸海空三方均受重大損失、而卒米佔領挪威、德國前由那維克所得之大批鐵砂供給、今已無期停止矣、在此三星期餘之時期中、德海軍所　損失甚重、計損主力艦二艘、沉巡洋艦三四艘、其三艘已經確知、又沉驅逐艦十一艘、潛艇五艘、再運輸船與供應船之被沉、或自行鎜沉、或起火者、共三十艘喪失生命數千之多、另有運輸船供應船十艘爲矢魚雷　中、大的亦沉失矣、王家海軍在此時期中喪失　逐艦四艘、潛艇三艘、小兵船一般、漁船五艘、另有五軍艦因受空襲負創、及有供應船一艘、中敵魚雷沉沒、就此項數字而輪、王家海軍之實力所失甚微、而德海軍則受創至巨、而足變史海軍力之比較差數、並足使協約國主力緩隊得重作重要分配矣、前者因吾人北海需要强大之海軍、故不能分軍以防地中海、今則可以爲之矣、故英法戰鬥艦巡洋艦與輔助艦已臨地中海東部、而向亞力克山特里亞進發矣、總之吾人如未達到目的、而德人亦未運到其目的、而其損失則遠在吾入之上也、（二日路透電）</p>

<p>「目前祗有蘇聯民衆、能以熱烈情緒慶祝此勞慟節日、蘇聯社會主義之成就、蘇聯民衆引爲自豪、同時、彼　對此次未被捲入第二次帝國主義戰爭、尤爲滿意、」</p>
<p>「時至今日、資本國家之民衆、必更爲深切認識資本主義與蘇維埃國家之區別、在列寗·史達林黨及偉大的史達林領導下、蘇聯一萬萬八千三百萬民衆、正在努力建設彼等社會主義之生活、蘇聯不願加入戰爭、但隨時準備應戰、」</p>
<p>芬蘭自衛隊之被擊潰、以及　納興陣之被摧毀、已證明吾民衆之力量及紅軍之光榮　與勇敢、</p>
<p>「目前國際形勢極爲複雜、第二次帝國主義戰爭　已逐漸擴大、煽動者現企圖將吾人牽入此流血大屠殺、甚至在機會來臨時、進攻吾國之領土、因此、吾人必須隨時準備應付一切、吾人必須加倍增强祖國之防務、並鞏固紅軍海軍之力量、吾人必以布爾希維克精神完成此項任務、而此種任務之完成、已由吾一萬萬八千三百萬民衆之意志及賢明之列寗·史達林黨所保證」、</p>
<p>軍隊受檢閱時、步伐整齊、獲得來賓稱譽、同時、紅軍及海軍指揮人員亦經過檢閱台、向史達林及其同志致敬、在此輩指揮人員後爲軍官學校之學生及指導、</p>
<p>最令人注意者　爲步兵之進行、彼等步伐之整齊以及精神之雄壯、獲得一致好評、此時、勞動大衆之武裝份子入塲、彼等係紡織業工人、鐵路員工及科學家、美術家、肩負長槍、精神飽滿、表示彼等隨時起而保衛祖國、</p>
<p>飛機六百餘架　表演新式戰術</p>

<p>勞働大衆之游行、共四小時、表示蘇聯民衆之政治團結、以及彼等對黨及史達林之擁護、（一日塔斯社電）</p>
<p>蘇聯國防委長　五一發表文吿</p>
<p>莫斯科　蘇聯國防入民委員長伏羅希洛夫、今日爲勞働節發表文告云、</p>
<p>「今日本國民衆慶祝五月一日、此係檢視吾勞働大衆成就之紀念此紀念日、今年蘇聯尤應以莊嚴之方式慶祝此紀念日、良以除在社會主義文化及和平工作方面已有極大成就外、蘇聯紅軍並已爲祖國添增光榮的勝利也、</p>
<p>英·法雖企圖將吾人捲入歐戰、但由於史達林領導下政府及黨的賢明政策、吾國幸未被波及、英。法集團向德進行之戰爭現已趨擴大、新的國家已被捲入戰禍、同時、在遠東方面、戰爭亦在繼續中、關於吾國之外交政策、已由吾國元首莫洛托夫在蘇聯最高議會中加以說明、並已由該議會加以通過、該項布爾希維克的外交政策、極爲明顯、其主要目的爲保證各國和平及本國之安全、此項政策係由吾國　與各國之條約所保障、同時並由吾一八三·〇〇〇·〇〇〇民衆及武裝同志所擁護、去年秋間、芬蘭政府成爲「强大」保護者之玩物、非特未與否國簽訂友好條約、且向吾人作戰、</p>
<p>蘇聯政府立即採取步驟、保障列寗格勒及吾人西北邊境、結果芬蘭自衛隊已由列寗格勒軍區隊伍予以致命打擊、而所謂孟納興陣綫亦被摧毀、查孟納興陣綫係由帝國主義專家、工兵及參謀團所建造、爲準備攻擊蘇聯之軍事根據地、</p>
<p>又孟納興陣綫之建造與馬奇諾及齊格菲陳綫同、該陣綫築有數百之堅固堡壘、機槍·大砲·隧道·地雷陷坦克車網及其他各種障礙物、戰爭挑釁者以爲該陣綫係不可攻克之堡壘、無論任何軍隊均將被擊潰、但在列寗格勒區隊伍嚴重的打擊下、卒被粉碎、史達林曾謂、就布爾希維克黨而言、世上並無不可攻克之堡壘、此言現已獲得證明、</p>
<p>在此次戰事中、蘇聯紅軍官員以及政治人員非特已充分顯示紅軍之士氣、以及蘇維埃軍器之偉大、且已證明紅軍無論在任何環境下、均能善用其武器、此外、紅軍除擊潰芬軍外、並已擊破企圖將芬蘭戰事易爲世界大戰之帝國主義武裝軍隊、最近數日之戰事、已使紅軍在戰爭上獲得新經騐、吾人應從事研究此種新經騐、糾正吾人之缺點、繼續增强吾人之優點、布爾希維克幷無株守之積習、吾人不應對於吾人之勝利深覺自滿、時代在進展、因此、紅軍亦必須繼續增强其實力、無論在軍事學識方面、均應精益求精、</p>
<p>帝國主義戰爭挑釁者必仍以戰爭威脅加諸吾國、因此、吾人應隨時準備、並改善吾人之戰鬭力、擊退任何進攻吾祖國之敵人、又蘇聯海長古斯納作夫發表文告、指出勞働節日之政治意袋及蘇聯近年來之成就、文云、「蘇聯波羅的海及北部艦隊、已與紅軍同時完成其任務、擊潰芬蘭自衛隊、政府並已嘉獎、海軍之功蹟」（一日塔斯電）</p>

<h3 id="c70">平準委會繼續維持 <a href="#c70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>昨日午後、本埠銀行界鉅子、曾接香港方面私電、據接近財政當局者表示、中央對於滬市法幣滙率、始終由平準基金委員會維持、過去外滙暗市兩度緊縮、乃爲打擊日僞陰謀、取締投機行爲之故、現中央決將增加外匯平準基金、逆料滬市外匯、即將臻於穩定、按法幣外滙暗市、數月來極爲穩定、最近且有鬆動之勢、聞係中央方面擬增加外滬基金、計英幣五白萬鎊、美金七八百萬元、如果此訊屬實、則此次停止供給、殆純係傾軋投機者頭寸、外匯即可逐漸放長、而盲從投機之徒、則徒然自取其咎耳、</p>

<p>昨據某經濟學專家談、美國在華利益之重心在滬、無論投資或貿易幾全部集中上海、自日本統制華北貿易、美商在平津方面、已無發展之餘地、美貨以上海爲主要市塲、現美貨銷滬佔美國對華輸出百分之七五、上海對美輸出、亦佔全國運美貨物百分之八十以上、除非美國甘心退出中國市塲、否則決不肯任日人擺布、日人所以遲遲未敢破壞法幣、濫施統制者、亦知有所顧忌也、</p>
<h3 id="c72">昨晨金融市塲　頓呈空前混亂 <a href="#c72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>兩小時內狂漲不已</p>
<p>英文大美晚報云、法幣匯價、今（二日）晨父吿劇跌、昨日（一日）法幣美滙平均十六元五、今晨在兩小時內漲至二十元七五、中午前一小時、始稍回乎、午刻收盤爲法幣二十元、合美金一元、當今晨開盤時、上海對紐約滙兌爲五元九六二五、僅有買戶而無賣戶、旋匯豐　麥加利拒不出售外匯消息、遍傳全市、顯係中英平準基余復已停止干涉上海黑市買戶出價、遂益提益高、致美滙縮至現貨四元九三七五、五月期貨四元六八七五若干賣客乃有拋出、然其拋出、是否因平準基金恢復工作之故、則未可知、市塲買風仍熾、惟更爲審慎、迄午、紐約滙兌稍鬆、收盤現貨五元一二五、五月期貨爲五元、下午市况之前途、不可捉摸、美匯旣有空前緊縮、英滙亦縮至三便士半、即去歲八月份之最低紀綠、</p>
<p>日元滙價同時下跌</p>
<p>本埠銀行界對於日元滙價法幣下跌隨獲强烈印象日金一百元午刻仍可以法幣一百廿五元購得之、日方軍用票一百元、僅須法幣一百廿四元、即可購得、故本市日元滙價「僅稍逾東京官定匯價」四分之一而已、外滙市塲今晨之發展、使其他市塲立即受强烈影響、平準基金或其代表銀行對於突從滙市撒回支持、皆未說明理由、致種種謠諑紛起、未能獲得可靠消息、關於美國行將援助法幣說、尙未證實、但一般皆信美國或將採取辦法、至少援助、「自由中國」境內交易之法幣、</p>
<p>金價又見空前高峯</p>
<p>現金昨日亦受極大影響、而造成瘋狂劇漲之狀態、昨晨開市時、即現驚人之象、在漲爲六千八百元、較前日收市之五千七百二十八元、竟突躍一千零七十二元之鉅、惟未幾又忽猛跌八百元、繼之父飛漲至七千元之空前高峯、嗣後又降爲六千三百元、至午收市時、回降爲六千二百六十元、飾金則僅高一百元、爲六百五十元、</p>
<h3 id="c73">嚴重局勢造成　外間傳說不一　金融界傳兩大原因 <a href="#c73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>昨日本埠金融黑市、情形異常緊張、金融界對於此點、認爲此種現象之造成、基於兩項重要原因、（一）由於匯豐及麥加利兩銀行、爲防止日方鉅額套匯、一度停止供給外匯、外間懷疑平準基金發生問題、（二）鑒於過去數月中滬關入超激增、據調查所悉、本年第一季、依照黑市匯率計算、全國入超九萬萬、上海一埠二萬五千萬、以致滬市需要外匯激增、（外傳出超之說、係根據法定匯率計算、並無確實數字）、</p>
<p>外間臆測絕不可靠</p>
<p>昨晨市塲中、另有某種謠傳、認爲黑匯之所以發生劇變而突趨緊縮者、另一理由、係盛傳僞「中央銀行」行將成立之故、但昨日出可靠方面探悉、此項消息、絕難證實、而權威方面亦表示、即使如此、其與匯市之影饗、亦不至有如此之大、匯市之所以突趨緊縮者、大半原因、當爲本埠入超之激增、據銀行界稱、在過去數月中、本埠外匯之需要突增、而此種需要之听以增加、又無非因本埠入口貨物數量激增、入口貨物數量之激增、即足使本市中外商人不論匯價高漲至如何程度、必須購買而付淸貨款、</p>
<p>日方大事套購外滙</p>
<p>此外銀行界又表示、除本埠對外匯之需要激增外、在過去數月中、日人以法幣套購外匯之數量、亦頗驚人、以往日方係以海關收入爲套取外匯之張本、據一般人士估計、在過去四月中、日人以法幣套取外匯達數十萬萬元之鉅、此可爲匯市突趨緊縮之另一原因、</p>
<p>紐約英滙亦吿跌價</p>
<p>路透社一日紐約電、挪威形勢不定、英國復有貨船改道好望角　決定、今晨紐約英匯價乃相繼趨低、英鎊開盤爲三元四八五、收盤稍回爲三元四九六二五、查昨日收盤爲三元五〇八七五、法佛郞開盤爲一·九八三七五、收盤爲一·九八一二五、查昨日收盤爲一·九九、外國公債賣風頗熾、義國公償因英義緊張增劇、價格低落、</p>

<h3 id="c75">法幣價値穩定　平準基金充裕 <a href="#c75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>維持幣制早具決心</p>
<p>中國政府對於維持幣制穩定外匯、早抱有最大決心、今抗戰已二年有餘、而法定外匯、依然如前、即英匯一先令二便士半美匯三十元、對於各業正當需要、仍各儘量供給、至於上海黑市外滙、亦由平準外匯基金會酌予維持、並不因投機者之操縱而予停止供給、此種情形早有事實之證明、關於平準會本身之基金、依然充實、外傳用罄之說、實屬無稽，</p>
<p>匯率低落有利輸出</p>
<p>據一般人士觀察、黑市滙價之突趨緊縮、似與法幣前途、有密切之關係、目認爲由黑市匯價之劇變、可決定法幣前途之狀况、至黑市匯價之所以突然緊縮、其中最顯著之原因、爲有平準基金發生問題之謠傳、所謂平凖基金者、乃在便利對外貿易、但結果竟引起若干人和用此項基金從中謀利、遂致造成目前混亂惡劣之狀况、據權威方面之表示、則認爲中國幣値目前實已循自然之水準而發展、如吾人以此爲觀察點、則與對外貿易有密切關係、觀於近數月來人超之激增、其所造成之趨勢、如以全國計、實已成爲有增無减之現象、職是之故、中國幣値之下跌、似有不易以人力遏止之概、但與中國整個對外貿易、亦並非完全不利、因滙率跌落、可使洋貨進口减少、土貨輸出增加、兩者將來仍有趨於均衡可能、</p>
<p>平準基金依然充裕</p>
<p>此外、吾人又須注意者、所謂平準基金、其處理之方針、並不在對中國法幣規定一固定之匯率、以免平準基金之耗費過大、但吾人如以爲二大英國銀行所供給之平準基金、有一定數額、則此種判斷、實屬誤解、此事可由二銀行最近之分析報吿中證明之、因該二銀行在滙市上賣出購進、本身亦可獲得利益、故吾人可以斷言、平準基金非但不致被耗費殆盡、且可由該二銀行繼續設法維持、或擴充其數量、</p>
<p>投機份子決難獲利</p>
<p>四月份之外匯交易、業已交割淸楚、投機家所進五月期貨、據聞達七百萬至八百萬美元之間、照目前平準金運用之情形觀之、多方現時固無利可圖、今後亦然、所進之美匯、大部均於匯率低落時購入、將來祇有忍痛拋塞、或甘願貼費掉換六月期、以希冀彼時環境之有利、此輩投機份子、認定匯市有縮無漲、故增加平準基金之消息、使若輩之希望消滅、</p>

<p>英文大美晚報云、據可靠消息、此次日軍在滬西進行殘忍的反游擊戰、傷亡慘重、游擊隊因日軍屠殺鄕民、焚燒村莊、乃奮身出而報復、得農民之協助、向各地日軍反攻、其行動迅速而靈活、聞已獲顯著勝利、星期日及星期一日間、日軍一隊、在滬杭鐵路松注區、被游擊隊截斷、而遭痛擊、日軍亟派兵大增援、致該區若干地點、日軍充斥、近月來駐紥長江多數城鎮之日軍、數額大减、因大多已開前綫增援、乃調到「和平救國軍」、以示不協助、自大規模游擊戰爆發後、使華中日軍、疲於奔命、人力殊感竭蹶、日軍雖大舉摧毀村鎮、以期消游擊隊根據地、惟游擊隊賡續活動、星期二日晚、日方派救護車數輛、駛抵北站、以接來目游擊區之受傷日兵、</p>
<p>日軍撤退</p>
<p>上月二十六日、有日軍約千名、開往滬西諸翟·蟠龍·紀王廟·觀音堂等鎭、分別留駐各該處、茲據傳稱昨日（一日）留駐諸翟之日軍、約二百名、强將全鎭居民趕集一處、如有畏避者、即遭毒打經日僞首腦、向趕集之居民「演說撫慰」、隨後日軍即起拔回滬、居民怏怏星散、據稱、留駐其他各該鎮之日軍、亦將即日撤離、</p>
<p>實地視察</p>
<p>大陸報云、上海西上五哩之靑浦區、近受日軍荼毒、星期一日、本市英美新聞記者五人、曾往該區探視、目擊焚成白地之村落十二處、及傷亡村民、其傷心怵目之情景、及焚村落之照片、皆已刋於大陸報、本市日陸軍發言人、昨（一日）竟璋否認焚燒一處以上之村落、及殺害婦孺、</p>
<p>掩飾事實</p>
<p>據稱、靑浦區乃共黨游擊隊之巢穴、反日情慼極强、且　游擊隊化裝鄕民、擊斃日兵數名、日軍一隊、乃於四月十四日開始對游擊隊進行軍事行動、旨在完全撲滅共黨份子、日軍曾排戶搜查、發現許多共黨份子、化裝農民、並抄出大批軍器與軍火、日軍行動極審愼、故反日報紙所載殺害平民連同婦孺在內之說、並不確實、起火村落僅一處、擊斃日兵之游擊隊、在該村設有司令部云、</p>

<p>繼姑虐待</p>
<p>且處於舊式家庭之中、痛苦殊深、而其所天則在蘇州東吳大學讀書、鞭長莫及、不能有所庇護、不料志子因身體素弱、乃棄學赴北平協和醫院養疴、迭决函招其妻赴平、皆爲翁姑所阻、直至志千病人膏肓、仲氏始得趕至病榻之旁、相叙無幾、藁砧即溘然長逝、當時氏之神經受刺戟頗深、一度曾在二層樓上躍下、</p>
<p>希圖自盡</p>
<p>經人見而援救、得免於難、及至扶柩回申、父遭翁姑之拒、氏乃挈領其所育之女慶儀（現年八議）歸寗暫住、詎迄今忽已四載有餘、翁姑方面毫無接回之表示、雖曾一度向其翁姑要求生活費而涉訟於蘇州法院、初審判決氏可得生活費三千餘金、但經對造之上訴、而遭敗訴、現此案尙延擱於最高　院查氏系出名門、深知禮敎、且受高等敎育、</p>
<p>靑年守寡</p>
<p>已屬人生之慘變、翁姑見擯內心尤爲痛苦、歸寗四載、父母雖無閒言、然偶一思及舊禮敎中「嫁出女兒潑出水」之情形、自覺無顏久居、人生樂趣、毫無所圖、憂鬱之餘、逕萌短見、遂於四月二十六號下午五時、氏與其八歲女慶儀同時呑服安眠藥片三瓶自殺、幸經家人發覺尙早、急將車送紅十字會醫院施以急救母女</p>

<p>自晨每條（十兩）、初開九時以前人心尙定、待九時匯市開出竟吿有行無市、致人心頓起恐慌、大衆爲避免風險計、待匯市開出再行交易、故開市比往日較遲半小時、十時光景某金號首喊七千元賣出、但當時祇有另一金號還價六千七百元買進、不久即見做開價爲六千七百元、比上日軋漲九百七十二元、實屬罕見、後以買戶絕跡、一瀉二百元、且毫無成交、後再以金號帮及銀樓業傾吐、雖其時某證券帮乘機扒吸、頭寸終感充斥、續見回落二百五十元、證券帮出銀號五十兩、遜爲六千二百五十元、旋乃銀號帮忽來猛進、而賣者已漸轉少、竟一漲再跳二百五十元、銀號進錢兌業二十兩、爲六千五百元、後乃外匯轉鬆、重掀起賣風、證券帮忽來復出、而金號錢兌業亦塞、不久復見回跌三百元、登劵帮出銀號三十兩、爲六千二百元、目聞其時六千一百八十元亦有少數成交、但六千二百元限價買戶未曾得手者亦有、十一時後賣者漸少、而證劵帮某號及銀號帮突來收撈、遂飛升一百九十元、銀號進金號二十兩、爲六千三百九十元、時六千四百，限價、賣戶頗多、漲風被阻、後再加銀號帮止扒力塞、頓回小一百三十元、銀號互做三十兩、爲六千二百六十元作午收價、午後開時人心奇佳、金號抬價收買、竟橫跳一百九十元、金號進銀號二十兩、爲六千四百五十元、後證券帮賣出、立回低七十元、銀號對做十兩、爲六千三百八十元、卒因外匯復吿緊、證券帮忽來復進、同時錢兌業亦買、飛漲一百五十元、金號進銀號三十兩、爲六千五百一二十元、後買風漸息、金號陡起賣意、塞出有數、立回落一百三十元、銀號出證券帮二十兩、爲六千四百元、入後證券帮再來搜購、重告向上、證券帮進金號二十兩、爲六千四百八十五元作晚收價、結果比上日在漲七百五十七元、全天五百元上落、現金號之本牌金售出價、照烚赤較高十數元、收進减低三十元、現標金照掛牌金低五十餘元、均鮮做開、</p>

<p>昨糖市因外匯暴縮、荷匯會到八·七五〇、後　長至九·五〇〇至九·三七五、但本市公會劃盤、以出戶索價過高、結果致乏成交、現貨　四粗白外棧新貨叫七十五元、轉口貨六十元、太古車白B嘜西棧貨叫八十五元、荷赤六十三元、叫升之程度均達十元左右、故進戶觀望、只包未有成交、國糖亦爲帶緊、聞刁靑會開五十七八元、升二三元、餘亦叫漲、</p>

<p>厚薄粳等國米、到貨雖有二千餘包、然以洋米暴漲、遂令並駕齊驅、市上賣買又變爲塲外暗盤、因價較洋米低廉、做開殊夥、雖後亦相互帶高、然終不若洋米之巨、僅一二元之上落、做開錫帮特淸粳四十八元、大市四十七元、粉粳四十六元、常崑白粳四十七元半至四十五元半、靑泗特薄四十七元出零、大市四十五六元、中關四十四元左右、南港早稻四十五元、特別四十六元、中次四十三元、斛見四十一二元、</p>

<p>某甲素好鬥蟋蟀，前年秋季，獲得一頭，屢鬥屢勝，得彩至千有餘金。比蟋蟀死，盛以銀棺，鐫以玉碣，題曰：「勁捷將軍」。葬於後院之花臺，而並圓其塚焉。去秋白露旣降，故癖復萌，各處購求，迄無當意。一夕，獨步後院，陡聞虫聲唧唧，就而聽之，乃在塚中，掘塚覓之，無有所見，啟其銀棺，則昔之僵而葬者，今且赳赳鼓翅張牙，躍然已具鬥志焉。某喜出望外，以為將軍之復生也，取而哺之，以所畜者試與較比，則俱望風披靡，已乃出外，稍稍博彩，亦俱投無不利，自是珍如拱璧，非巨彩不能博一鬥。翌日，客有自杭州來者，携盆訪某，且請鬥彩，某見　蟋蟀不甚精健，故昂其彩，議以十金為一花，以百花決一勝，客未滿意，擬更加增一部，由是兩下入盆，甫交口，某之蟋蟀，轉身走躍，迫之復鬥，則　跳不已，已乃挺然而斃，斃後償所負彩，蓋罄前年秋季之所獲，而猶不及半云。今年春日後院草綠，某閒步過蟀蟋塚處，恨而毀掘一窟云。</p>

<p>受着人　大激怒的時候，他仍安於緘默。先知以賽亞所說的預言，描寫耶蘇一點不錯，預言說，「他同犯人被釘在十字架上，同惡人埋葬在一起，雖則他不曾犯罪，口中也無欺騙的話。」羅馬法官在該撒的審判廳中對耶蘇「說，你不聽見他們控告你許多的事嗎？」耶蘇不答一言。令法官覺得非常之驚鄂。當耶蘇不答一言時，彼拉多帶他到宮前面對眾人站着，簡單而真實的說這麼一句話，「看，這個人！」耶蘇受着極大的激怒和怨屈，所有的本能，催促他發言，免致後悔，在這個時候，他仍緘默如常，這非有真勇敢，真精神不辦。從這一點，我們看出耶蘇的偉大。耶蘇明白緘默的價值，故嚴格控制自己說話的才能。第二點我們看出耶蘇謹慎發言。他要說話的時候，十分仔細選用言詞，擇有價值的說出，並且簡捷，不枉發一言。每一句話，對於人生都有多少的意義，每一個字，都足啓示出他自己的人格。記得當美國舉行格定堡戰塲奉獻禮時，美國大演說家赫爾，足足講了一個多鍾頭，而林肯只演說七分鍾，如今譯成世界各國的文字，流傳千古。從四福音所載看來，耶蘇的話，用三十五分鍾，可以讀完，這樣簡短，然而被人引用却最多，這樣看來，言詞的價值，不在量而在質。我們的禍福苦樂，多從我們所說的話而來。說話的才能，是我們極大的資產，也可成爲我們永久的危險。「誰是有智慧有見識的呢，他就當在智慧的溫柔中顯出他的善行來。」　如欲詳細研究請函郵箱一二二七號</p>
<h3 id="c115">重提「安全運動」 <a href="#c115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>— 前車</p>
<p>在大都市中，每年喪生在車輪下的枉死鬼，實在是一個可怕的紀錄。去年秋季，上海兩租界當局特舉行宣傳「安全運動」，法至善也。據當時的報告，在拍電影，貼標語，各校學生出發各馬路服務的大規模宣傳及實行的時期中，車輛肇禍的紀錄確是减少的。可是人們對於死的威脅雖然感到可怕，而「馬路如虎口，當中不可走」警告却一忽兒就忘了：駛機者在肇禍後也果然怕吃官司，但「惟我獨尊」的精神還是繼續着，所以「宣傳」時期一過，彷彿大家都「保證安全」了而忘得乾乾淨淨。</p>
<p>所謂「安全運動」自然是行人與駛機者雙方面合作的，但有許多情形却也是行人所防不勝防的。要舉例吧，手頭有一個最好的例子在，就是藝華主人嚴春堂的雙足輾傷。</p>
<p>這過失自然不在嚴某，因爲乘客無論怎樣擁擠，車門沒有關上，駛機者是不能即行開車的，如果由於售票員的提早拉鈴，則該售票員應和駛機者共同負這責任，因爲他們是這車上最密切的合作者。</p>
<p>更由於這慘劇的發生，對於十路公共汽車的駛機者與售票有不能不說的幾點意見，—其實也是他們的罪狀，因爲即使不闖禍，他們的玩忽職務也是事實。</p>
<p>我們知道十路公共汽車是最擁擠的車輛，因爲站上乘客眾多而不停車是常見的（這希望公司能多加車輛），但因此使駛機者養成一種習慣，有時車中並不十分擁擠，也踏着風門向前開去，讓許多乘客在站上鵠候，於是在一輛二輛甚至三輛車子開過後，站上的乘客像購平糶米一樣的排起隊來，這樣在第四輛車來的時候，自然是無法容納如許乘客的，售票員提早拉鈴就發生在這時候，而不幸的乘客輾傷雙足的慘劇也發生在這時候。</p>
<p>這不過是一個例子，其他電車或無軌電車也有這種情形。</p>
<p>讓我再說一遍，「安全運動」是行人與駛機者合作的，但故意以自己的生命和車輛博鬥的終究是個笑話，所以駛機者的注意自己的職務，也是「安全」之道。</p>
<p>「安全運動」是是「遊藝會」，等於駛機不是一件簡單的機械工作一樣。</p>
<h3 id="c116">「生活不下」 <a href="#c116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>— 陳參</p>
<p>路過跑馬廳路，幾個相當大的瘦的粉筆字：「生活不下」，闖入我的眼簾。接着是一個垂了頭的母親，懷中抱着不滿週歲的嬰孩，旁邊還有一男一女，默默地跪着在哀求路人的矜憐。</p>
<p>「生活不下！」那是一個多迫切多簡單有力的呼聲，它强烈地表現着求生存的願望；它比洋洋灑灑的「告地狀」更直截了當，更一針見血。</p>
<p>旁邊圍着一些人，凝視着他們，間或也有一個二個路過的人擠進來張望一下，然而又望望然去之。難道他們是鐵石心腸嗎？見了這些彷彿是麥綏萊勒木　中的人物，竟漠然無動於中，不伸出他們同情的手來。可是你想錯了，這些栖栖皇皇來來去去的不相識者，也許他自己也該歸在「生活不下」一類裏呢！</p>
<p>然而孤島上又儘多着生活得太好的人們：高樓大廈，嬌妻美妾，錦衣玉食，一呼百諾，「生活不下」這迫切的簡單有力的呼聲，他們是無從見到的，也永遠不會聽到；因爲他們生活在另外一個世界中。</p>
<p>但請你們掏出你們的同情心來吧，要知道「生活不下」的一羣，也是我們炎黃遺胄呢。本「風雨同舟」之義，我們　把他們從飢餓綫上搶救過來的貴仵，只要你們把　費的生活節制一些，一舉手一投足之勞，就令人受　不淺了。</p>
<p>我們應該使「生活不下」的人們大家生活下去！</p>
<h3 id="c117">一個疑問 <a href="#c117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>— 心印</p>
<p>四點多鍾，電車中擠得差不多透不過氣來。</p>
<p>金神父路到了，乘客下去了很多，月台上也舒暢得多了。車動了後，開車的先說了：</p>
<p>「兩個　赤老」走了，那個老頭子不知給他扒去沒有？」</p>
<p>「不曉得，想來不會空手罷。」賣票的回答。</p>
<p>一個乘客不懂似的問道：</p>
<p>「兩個「赤老是什麼？」」</p>
<p>「三隻手！」</p>
<p>「那兩個？」那乘客繼續問下去。</p>
<p>我沒有聽賣票者的回答，只是心中疑問着：</p>
<p>「旣然曉得，爲何不捉牢他們呢？」</p>
<p>邁而西愛路到了，乘客紛紛下去，我也隨着下了車。</p>

<p>第廿三回　舊侶新儔文章有價　名區勝地管領得人</p>
<p>這事，金澹雲已暗暗通知了朱愛人，敎她放心好了。而且過一天，蘇理雅太太還想來參觀你們的醫院與嬰院咧。因此朱愛人想到：與其過一天來參觀醫院與嬰所，不如現在就來參觀。便說：『那末我們今天送了君素姊到校後，不如就到敝處安樂鎮看看我們的鄉下醫院與鄉下育嬰院。倘然不嫌怠慢，就在我們那裏吃一餐便飯好嗎？』金澹雲道：「不！我們的路程已經排好了。我們送了君素姊回學校後，我們便要到無錫奄頭渚吃中飯。這是預先約好了的，是建成的一位老同學薛工程師夫婦請客。這位薛工程師，是太湖水泥公司的副經理，而又是那裏的總工程師。晚上，我們要趕到湖州，住宿在環湖第三飯店，夜飯也有人請吃，就是建成的令姊與姊丈。他們住居在湖州，也是預先約定的。明天早晨，我們回到嘉興，午飯也有人約定。從嘉興冉回到蘇州，到那時我們或者可以到安樂鎮一游，然後就回到上海了。“朱愛”道：「那末也好！准定明天下午到安樂鎮吧。我就趁了這趟車，回到醫院裏去了。只是我們沿途叨擾，深滋不安，如何是好。」金澹雲道：「自家姊妹，說什麼客氣的話。」那時何家兩位小姐，本要想請林建成林工程師到自由村去看一看她們的廠址，預備建築起來。只是他們在蜜月休假期中，不好說得。今天知道他們明天下午要到安樂鎮，到了安樂鎮，距自由村也就不遠了。趁此便請他們夫婦到自由村一看廠址，也就可以約略有個大槪了。當時何家兩位小姐便乘勢與金澹雲說了，金澹雲便即答應道：「一定可以的，我們并且要到自由村拜訪朱村長朱老先生，他還是先父的同袍，也是先父所最尊敬的長輩咧。」何家兩位小姐恰逢到有這個機會，自然歡喜不迭。她們談話之問，車子漸漸已近蘇州，是一個熱鬧的鎮市，而蘇州那個報恩寺塔，已魏然在望了。蘇理雅太太道：「這裏是個什麼地方？」吳君素道：「這裏喚做外跨塘，是蘇州東北的一個鄉鎮。」因便問金澹雲：「我就在這裏上車吧，趁着公共汽車，便可以到我學校裏了。」</p>

<p>— 秋熹</p>
<p>年來「古裝片」的攝製，眞可謂風起雲湧，大月不可一世，但　觀其內容，十九都取材於「才子佳人」的兒女私情。像這類的「古裝片」只能合一部份人的胃口，在少年兒童們看來，是感不到任何情趣的。所以我希望各國片公司當局，對於以後選擇材料方面，斟酌多採歷史上民族小英雄有關少年兒童們的良好資料，想來亦是少年兒童們迫切需要的吧！</p>
<p>處於今日的孤島，少年們遭際的艱困，惡勢力的引誘，在在足以使他們麻醉，沉淪，墮落，因爲他們遠離了祖國的懷抱，這裏，我們可用暗示的方式，拍攝一些有意識的影片，來激勵他們的意志，指示他們的途徑，使他們知道强敵臨頭，自已正要怎樣的奮鬥！</p>
<p>至於歷史上，民族小英雄的資料很多，像春秋魯國的在琦，爲保衛祖國，救國家的垂危，而執干戈奮身殺敵，陣亡沙塲的壯烈事蹟。明嘉定的石童子，爲禦寇而作犧牲的英勇行動，及明末，松江的夏存古——本刊於日前刋有海星君的「少年英雄夏存古」中云魏如晦現已從事編爲兒童歷史劇本——當淸兵南下即毅然從戎，圖謀復國的可歌可泣的故事，都是現實的拍攝的好題材。</p>
<p>此外，還有歷史上名人童年的奮鬥史，均値得現代少年兒童們來傚法，來實踐。</p>
<h3 id="c121">評永安樂社義演「潘金蓮」 <a href="#c121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>— 吾</p>
<p>永安公司同人組織之永安樂社，日前爲上海救濟中山難民會邀請，義演於蘭心大戲院，一連八晚，記者於三十日晚驅車往觀，是晚所演爲該社新編之改良「潘金蓮」。</p>
<p>該劇凡演四句鐘，劇情之熱烈，空氣之緊張，無時或懈。劇情描寫潘金蓮作封建制度下强迫婚姻之犧牲品，由麥友雲編成，哀艷可誦，情節雋永，唱做繁重。劇作者國學精湛，所編曲詞典麗矞皇，透澈玲瓏：劇中對白，妙語雙關，回味無窮，措詞隱約，雅俗共賞非能手不克臻此。</p>
<p>主角郭琳爽之武松，扮相英武雄偉，動作靈敏穩重，歌曲淸亮，殺嫂祭靈兩塲，激昂悲壯，動人魂魄；念唱帶磁音，凄厲有勁。鍾鳳華之潘金蓮，演來亦甚精湛，戲叔時之先溫存，後撒嬌；見拒時又恨又驚，宛轉之情，曲曲傳出。嗓子細若游絲，響遏行雲。麥君飾西門慶，其灑落不覊，給人以深刻之印象，唱白字眼之淸，全塲獨一。梁毅民去武大郞，描摹欲絕，發揮個性，恰到好處；別弟一塲，情深語摯。唐觀鵬之九叔，神氣充沛，唱工醇厚，動作認眞，惟微嫌過火。其他配角，配搭備極整齊，頗有紅花綠葉之妙。</p>
<p>至於一切佈景·服裝·这具·燈光·富麗新頴，讀該社特輯，知「西施」與「桃花扇」更具國家思想，余意以爲此次義演券價，五元十元二十元，相當昂貴，祇以事屬善舉，不得不然耳，倘能稍低券價普遍公演，其裨益世道人心豈淺鮮哉</p>

<p>劇藝社演名劇「武則天」</p>
<p>當上海劇藝社在璇　演出的時候，已有作國際性的慈善公演的消息，但後來却又沉下去了。現在，這慈善公演又具體化起來。可以說，戲劇界還是第一次和國際發生關係，因爲這是英法大使主持，而由上海劇藝社執行演出的。劇藝社對這隆重公演的劇目，曾經有一番細細的考慮，當時打算演的是從英法著作譯過來的劇作，可是，想到以中國並未達到精境的舞台技巧來表演外國　劇，使外國人士看了未必感想到滿意。於是決定演出含有濃桃樂拉姍摩行將起舞的神秘姿態。</p>
<p>厚中國風味的戲，「武則天」就在這樣的情形下決定下來。武則大是中國歷史上僅見的女皇，外國人對她的經歷，知道的人是很多的。這不但可以引起外國人士的與趣，而且也使外國人士對他有眞正的理解。公演的日子已決定在五月二十二日晚塲舉行，票價大的是分五元和十元兩種。劇藝社對這次演出，十分重視，演員選擇尤其週密（武則天一角仍由夏霞担任），並定於五月三日作預演一次，这預演的票價則與中常相同。</p>

<p>Xingji: More than 3,000 Japanese troops who converged from Xiaxian, Anyi, Yuncheng, and other places to invade southward were encircled and severely decimated by the Nationalist army in the Dongpu area east of Ruicheng, suffering extremely heavy casualties. The Nationalist army took advantage of the momentum to advance directly to Ruicheng, fiercely attacking the city walls. On the evening of the 26th, the Japanese army could not withstand the assault and retreated in disarray towards Shangxiacao Village and Dongbi. They then coordinated with the Japanese troops at the 25 Ridges in Monan Town, attempting to resist stubbornly. After the Nationalist army recovered Ruicheng, a powerful unit immediately actively pursued and殲滅ed the remnants of the Japanese army. Another group of more than 4,000 Japanese troops was lured by the Nationalist army to the vicinity of Maojin Ferry and fell into a heavy siege, resulting in almost complete annihilation after the Nationalist army's relentless assault. (2nd Dispatch)</p>
<p>Zhengxian: The Japanese troops who invaded southward from Changzhi and Huguan in two routes were routed by the Nationalist army. In the following days, most of them have been歼灭ed by the relentless pursuit of the Nationalist army. A group of about 4,000 Japanese troops retreated to the south side of the Linjin Highway and on the 29th of last month, they attempted a last-ditch struggle near Jiuzhang Village (southwest of Jincheng), launching a fierce attack on the Nationalist army. The pursuing Nationalist troops charged bravely, killing more than 1,300 Japanese soldiers and driving more than 500 Japanese troops who had invaded Shangzaitou into a mountainous area, where they were completely殲滅ed after being surrounded on all sides. Currently, the rear of the Japanese troops who have penetrated deep into the area south of the Linjin Highway has been cut off by the Nationalist army. The complete annihilation is expected to be not far off. (2nd Dispatch)</p>
<p>Xingji: Ruicheng was recovered by the Nationalist army on the evening of the 26th. (1st Dispatch)</p>
<p>Lingbao: The Japanese troops in the southeast area of Zhangdian in Southern Shanxi have suffered heavy casualties after being attacked by the Nationalist army for several days, resulting in the recapture of Zhongcun, Guwang, and Jiwang. On the morning of the 29th, the Japanese troops were reinforced to over 3,000 and used intense firepower from machine guns and grenade launchers to resist the Nationalist army stubbornly near Nancun Bazhenglin. The morale of the Nationalist army was high, and they charged repeatedly, killing countless Japanese soldiers. The fierce battle continued until late at night. (3rd Dispatch)</p>
<p>Xingji: Since the 25th of last month, a Nationalist army unit has been engaged in a fierce day-long battle with more than 4,000 invading Japanese troops in the Wanjing Village Xushe area south of the Lingjin Highway, killing 600 to 700 Japanese soldiers and completely annihilating more than 300 Japanese troops who had entered Shangshen Tou. (1st Dispatch)</p>
<p>Luoyang: The Japanese troops in Zhangdian mobilized 8,000 troops from April 16th, launching a large-scale southward invasion under the cover of machine guns and artillery. The Nationalist army fought hard to intercept them, and by the 19th, more than 4,000 Japanese soldiers had been killed. Subsequently, a large number of Japanese reinforcements invaded Zhangmao Avenue to the east, advancing on Zhongtiao Mountain. The Nationalist army transferred a large force to the southern line of the mountain. The Japanese troops then successively occupied Guwang, Jiwang, Dongxi Yancun, Guocun, Yandi, Shizigou, and various strongholds south of Maojiashan. On the 23rd, they further invaded Wangyuan Village east of Yandi. Seeing that the Japanese troops had fallen into the Nationalist army's encirclement, the Nationalist army launched a full-scale general offensive on the 24th. By the 27th, the Japanese troops had been cut into several sections. The strongholds of Yandi, Shizigou, and other places defended by the Japanese were successively captured by the Nationalist army. On the 28th, the Nationalist army, with the momentum of victory, followed up with a mop-up operation, engaging in bloody battles for two days and nights. Miaoao, Yaodian, Guwang, Jiwang, and other places were once again in Nationalist hands. On the 30th, the Nationalist army continued to capture Dongxi Yancun and Huixia Village. The fighting strength of the Japanese troops had completely waned by this point. A small number of remnant Japanese troops have been surrounded by layers of Nationalist forces. Currently, the large Nationalist army on both sides of the highway is using a mobile deployment to encircle and attack the Japanese troops from multiple directions, flanking them from left and right. The entire force of the Japanese troops invading southward has been completely disintegrated, and their dream of sweeping through Zhongtiao Mountain for the eleventh time has become a vain illusion. (1st Dispatch)</p>
<p>Xingji: The Japanese troops who invaded Yangcheng eastward from Zhangma Zhongcun were blocked by the Nationalist army in the Donggua (west of Yangcheng) area. After several days and nights of hard fighting, the Japanese suffered heavy casualties. On the morning of the (30th), they attempted to retreat to Zhongcun. At noon, they reached the southwest highlands of Yangru (northwest of Dongfeng). The Nationalist army followed up in pursuit, and the Japanese troops continued to retreat west to Puhong Village. The Nationalist army captured a large amount of military supplies and documents. (1st Dispatch)</p>
<p>Zhengxian: The Japanese troops in Bo'ai, Northern Henan, have recently resumed their attempts to stir up trouble. On the morning of the 1st, a group of about 2,000 Japanese troops with eight cannons launched a fierce attack on the Nationalist army from Sixun (west of Bo'ai). Near Changping, they were valiantly intercepted by the Nationalist army, resulting in countless Japanese casualties. Another group of about 1,000 Japanese troops moved from Xuliang Town to the vicinity of Boji Palm. The Nationalist army relied on favorable terrain to block them from multiple directions, and the Japanese suffered even heavier losses. The fierce fighting continued until late at night. (2nd Dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing: A spokesperson for the Nationalist army stated at a press conference this afternoon that the Japanese army has carried out a large-scale concentration in a certain area northwest of Hankou, but no significant battles have yet occurred. The Nationalist army's concentration in the suburbs of Jincheng in southeastern Shanxi Province has been completed. The general offensive by the Nationalist army against the Japanese in that area can occur at any time. The fighting in Zhongtiao Mountain in southwestern Shanxi Province is nearing its end. Although the Japanese army's offensive has been repelled, the battle has been extremely fierce, and both sides have suffered significant losses. The Japanese claims of fierce fighting occurring in various areas near the border of Hubei, Hunan, and Jiangxi are laughable. The situation in that area is as calm as Chongqing.

<p>Chongqing: Today, a Nationalist army spokesperson stated that the Japanese army, attempting to expand its occupied areas and protect transportation along the Yangtze River, launched a three-pronged general offensive against Nationalist army positions in southern Anhui on April 24th. Subsequently, within a few days, they occupied Fanchang, Nanling, and Qingyang. When the Japanese army reached these three cities, there was no major battle because the Nationalist army had already adopted the strategy of allowing the Japanese army to penetrate deep and then disrupting their rear. At the same time, because the Japanese army occupied Fanchang, Nanling, and Qingyang, the Nationalist army was able to advance to the outskirts of Wuhu, threatening Japanese transportation between Nanjing, Wuhu, and other Anhui cities, forcing the Japanese army to rush around in an attempt to defend these cities. Chinese troops are fiercely attacking towns and cities on the south bank of the Yangtze River such as Datong and Fanchang, making it difficult for the Japanese army to defend their newly occupied positions. The spokesperson also pointed out that the Japanese army in southern Anhui has the 15th, 17th, and 116th Divisions. These three divisions are actively consolidating their positions near Nanjing. The spokesperson also stated that the Chinese artillery along the Yangtze River has caused significant damage to Japanese transportation on the Yangtze River. (2nd Dispatch by United Press)</p>
<p>Fuliang: The Japanese troops moving from Miaoqian to Lingyang Town were valiantly fought by the Nationalist army, and by 9:00 AM on the 1st, dead Japanese soldiers covered the fields. The Japanese army was unable to withstand the assault and retreated north in disarray, and Lingyang Town was immediately recovered. At the same time, another Nationalist army unit fiercely attacked Yangtiangeng, and by noon on the 1st, it was also recovered. Currently, the Nationalist army is vigorously pursuing the retreating Japanese troops in separate directions. (2nd Dispatch)</p>
<p>A Certain Place in Northern Anhui: More than 1,000 Japanese infantry and cavalry in Boxian attempted to harass the Nationalist army on the afternoon of the day before yesterday. Near Zhangfengliu, they were ambushed by Nationalist army troops. Caught off guard, the Japanese were shocked and disoriented. The Nationalist army took advantage of the momentum to charge bravely. The Japanese were unable to resist and retreated in disarray. More than 400 Japanese soldiers were killed, and a large amount of military supplies was seized. (2nd Dispatch)</p>

<p>Fengcheng: The Japanese army in Northern Jiangxi has been gathering remnants of its forces for days, launching counterattacks against the Nationalist army. After the Nationalist army inflicted heavy casualties on the Japanese army, the Nationalist army launched a full-scale attack on the 29th. Fierce fighting continued with the Japanese army for one day and night. Until the 30th, Fengxin City was recaptured, and many Japanese soldiers were killed. The remnant Japanese troops retreated in disarray towards Anyi. At the same time, other Nationalist army units successively recovered important strongholds such as Shayuan, Hucun, Chitian, Zhangchi, Tujie, Yapotan, Nuoli, and Jiaocun. Subsequently, the Nationalist army took advantage of the victory to advance in separate directions. The Japanese army collapsed at the mere sight of them, and successively recovered Futong Mountain and Shishu Mountain. One unit even entered Hongkou Street and is currently engaged in intense street fighting. That place will soon be recovered. (1st Dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing: Today, military news received here from the Nationalist side stated that the Japanese army's counterattack west of Nanchang has been repelled. After the Nationalist army recovered Jing'an on April 29th, Fengxin was recaptured at noon on the 30th. The Japanese army is retreating towards Anyi and Senpu (transliteration). (2nd Dispatch by Reuters) After the Japanese troops in Xiushui suffered setbacks in Jing'an and Fengxin, Northern Jiangxi, reinforcements were sent from Nanchang to attack Xishan and Wan Palace.

<p>Fancheng: The war in Southern Henan has recently reignited. The Japanese troops in the Xinyang area have begun to invade north after a series of heavy reinforcements in recent days. On the 28th, more than 1,000 Japanese troops from Yanghe invaded the Da Xiao Wuying and Liying areas on the south bank of the Huai River, engaging in fierce fighting with the Nationalist army. They then concentrated their firepower to attempt to cross the Huai River forcibly. The Nationalist army calmly opened fire, killing many Japanese soldiers as they were halfway across the river. A remnant group of Japanese soldiers retreated to the north bank and was殲滅ed by the Nationalist army. Another group of Japanese soldiers moved through Mujia Village to Wuzhai South (southeast of Pingchangguan) on the afternoon of the 30th and has already made contact with the Nationalist army.

On the afternoon of the 1st, Japanese troops in Fangjiakou, Luojiadupo, and other places fired more than 200 artillery shells at the Nationalist army. At the same time, Japanese soldiers launched fierce attacks. The Nationalist army calmly responded to the battle, and the Japanese army's repeated attempts to attack were unsuccessful. Subsequently, a unit of Japanese soldiers harassed the vicinity of Dawei, attempting to detour and use poison gas bombs in their attacks.

The Japanese corpses piled up like mountains, and they were unable to withstand the attack and retreated across the board. (2nd Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e10">Foreign Exchange and Legal Tender <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign exchange market experienced unprecedented turmoil. The market situation in the morning was chaotic, and the fluctuations in exchange rates were so wide that they defied normal logic. The exchange rate for British pounds shrank to 3 shillings and 25 pence, on par with the lowest exchange rate on August 11th of last year. The exchange rate for US dollars shrank to 4 yuan 6 jiao and 7.5 fen, which was an unprecedentedly high price, but the actual transaction price was even higher than this figure. As for the price of gold, it rose by 1,000 yuan, with the highest call price reaching 7,000 yuan. Other commodities such as cotton yarn also rose by 200 yuan, with each bale reaching a high price of more than 1,700 yuan. The demand for cash was so high that the discount rate was as high as 230 yuan. Credit became increasingly tight, and the interest rate for interbank lending also increased by about one point per month. Commodities such as rice, grain, oil, and beans all rose sharply in price due to speculation. What exactly is the reason for this? Upon observing the Reuters dispatch in yesterday's evening newspaper that American businessmen in Shanghai were requesting the US government to provide a financial loan to China to stabilize the financial situation, we can infer that in Shanghai's feverishly speculative market, someone must have stirred up a great disturbance. Speculators like to look for news in the cracks, and they always argue from the opposite perspective; the distance in time and the difference in rise and fall are the speculators' fields of profit. After yesterday's great change, many were elated, but few were disheartened. However, the vast majority of ordinary people saw their burdens increased many times over; one family rejoices, while the whole street cries, which is a true reflection of today's Shanghai society.</p>
<p>Why is foreign exchange shrinking? It means that foreign currencies are becoming more expensive and the legal tender is becoming cheaper. Why is foreign exchange shrinking? Everyone has a different opinion. Considering that it shrank to such an extreme degree, it can be asserted that there is absolutely no real reason for foreign currencies to suddenly become more expensive, and there is no genuine reason for the legal tender to suddenly become cheaper. Analyzing the main reason, it is nothing more than internal traitors and external enemies manipulating public sentiment in this economic war to profit from it. The focus of manipulating public sentiment lies in undermining the legal tender, and in shaking the legal tender system and belief in it. But is the legal tender really shaken? To the general public, the repeated shrinking of foreign exchange is equivalent to the repeated decline of legal tender. How can it not be shaken? If it were not shaken, why did the foreign exchange market not increase the supply of foreign exchange yesterday, but instead allow the market to freely introduce and withdraw chips for trading, leading to rumors that the Sino-British Exchange Equalisation Fund Committee would no longer intervene in the Shanghai black market for foreign exchange, and why did American businessmen request the US government to come forward and maintain the financial situation? It must be known that all of this is assessing the value of currency based on the currency itself, and mistakenly taking it as a shake in the legal tender itself. In fact, whether the legal tender itself is shaken depends on whether the legal tender reserve fund is adequate. Whether the legal tender reserve fund is adequate cannot be judged by the amount of gold, silver, and bills of exchange; the so-called gold, silver, and bills of exchange are not currency materials, but currency, and are not sufficient to serve as a measure of currency. Tracing back to the establishment of the legal tender system in China, the legal tender has already become an integral part of the national wealth, and its course is aligned with the national fortune. In other words, the ups and downs of China's national fortune directly affect the legal tender and become a clear direct proportion; China is in a hard-fought war of resistance, and the legal tender is in the midst of a storm; China will win the victory and be rebuilt, and the legal tender will also prosper. Therefore, saying that the legal tender will become like the imperial Russian ruble or the German mark after the First World War, which are equivalent to waste paper, is absolutely unimaginable. More specifically, the legal tender takes products as its measure, and products are the source of the legal tender. China is fortunate to possess endless treasures, and is also fortunate that the current war of resistance is still in an agricultural country with underdeveloped production, which is very different from a capitalist industrial country with all industries thriving; therefore, China's wealth will never be destroyed and will continue to grow. To use a small analogy to illustrate a large concept, it is like a farmer whose crops cannot be burned completely and cannot be stolen completely. There may be a time of hardship when the old crops have been depleted and the new crops have not yet been harvested, but when the autumn harvest arrives, there will be plenty of food and clothing again, and the suffering will come to an end. Therefore, short-term difficulties during the war are not surprising and are not to be worried about; as long as the government and the people work together to develop production, then any method can be used to acquire an endless amount of foreign currency, which means that there is no need to worry about the legal tender's reserve being depleted.</p>
<p>According to what we have heard, the legal tender exchange stabilization fund still meets the necessary standard. Some may think that the authorities' failure to maintain the Shanghai black market for foreign exchange is a sign that the exchange stabilization fund is depleted, but that is a big mistake. Maintaining the Shanghai black market for foreign exchange is no different from providing supplies to thieves. If you want to break the conspiracy to exploit and sabotage the legal tender, then it is better to let the foreign exchange in Shanghai be supplied and demanded on its own without maintaining it. Furthermore, recalling the past, the Exchange Equalisation Fund still secretly maintained the previous two foreign exchange contractions, so who knows whether the Chinese authorities are not taking appropriate measures to ease the pain in life caused by the general public's slightly higher prices. Even taking the positions of Britain and the United States as an example, the Chinese legal tender is originally tied to the British pound, and the Hong Kong and Shanghai financial markets are interdependent. The British are busy with the war and do not have time to take care of other things, but they will never easily give up their economic power in the Far East. Even if Britain has to give it up, someone will definitely rise up to replace it. The United States has no determination to maintain its rights and interests in the Far East, but if it does, it will never stand idly by regarding China's entire economy. Considering the two previous credit loans to China, we can already see the sincerity of the United States. The Reuters dispatch the day before yesterday said that the United States is cautious, not that it is indifferent; the United States supporting China is actually suppressing Japan, and helping China is actually helping itself, which is well known to the insightful people of the United States.</p>
<p>As for speculators and those who only protect their own interests and disregard the overall situation, it is truly unknown where their vision lies. Their intentions are despicable, their hearts are punishable, and their vision is even shorter. They are Chinese, and their property is in China, so how can they escape completely? Even if they convert all their assets into foreign currency, can today's foreign currency really remain unchanged for a long time? They are undermining the legal tender, throwing stones down the well of the legal tender, and not caring about damaging the legal tender, but the legal tender is still what they use to calculate their profits and losses. How can their ignorance and contradiction be described? However, we do not forgive them for their ignorance and contradiction as being insignificant; we still want to warn them: the more speculation, the more evasion, the greater the damage to the legal tender. The legal tender will certainly have a bright future, but unfortunately, if it is damaged, China's economic vitality will be hit; others are trying to sabotage it every day but cannot, but we are blindly acting, opening the door, and giving people the opportunity to attack; then, regardless of whether it finally remains unharmed, the speculator's behavior is, in essence, destroying the national financial system, and its crime is absolutely unforgivable.</p>
<p>In addition to the above, please allow me to add a few more words. Recently, the prices of all local goods have risen following the prices of foreign goods, but local goods are still cheaper; therefore, the more foreign goods people buy and prepare, the more affected they are by the shrinking of foreign exchange. Anyone who wants to avoid the impact only needs to vigorously promote local goods; this is one point. The black market for foreign exchange in Shanghai is not enough to represent the exchange rate, and it is not enough to represent the interior and the whole country; in other words, one should not measure everything with the vision, feeling, and concept of a corner of Shanghai; this is the second point. Shanghai is still an important international trading center, and only this port remains where foreign merchants in coastal China can trade freely. If foreign exchange shrinks frequently and imported goods become very expensive, it will be difficult for ordinary Chinese people to buy them, and foreign firms will also close their doors and leave, and the losses cannot be calculated. Because today's Shanghai market is rich in international character, the way to properly handle and defend Shanghai's financial situation is not only a matter for the Chinese, but also for the Chinese and foreign merchants in Shanghai to plan and deal with together.</p>
<h3 id="e11">Chamberlain's Report to the House of Commons: Current Status of the Norwegian Campaign: Military Plans Not Yet Complete: British Army Changes Planned Strategy <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>London: Prime Minister Chamberlain, responding to the public's desire, addressed the House of Commons today regarding the current state of the Norwegian campaign. The Prime Minister asked the Members of Parliament to be patient before he could give a detailed account, as military plans and movements are currently incomplete and therefore cannot be disclosed. The Prime Minister stated, "Today, I can only give a temporary statement. However, I hope Mr. Churchill and I will be able to give a more detailed account early next week. At that time, the House will undoubtedly wish to debate the entire matter based on the information available." About a month ago, the government decided to order a small number of troops to prepare everything so that if Germany took aggressive action against southern Norway, they could set sail and occupy the western Norwegian ports upon receiving orders. Any action planned by the government was conditional on Germany first violating Norway's neutrality. The House will certainly recall that three months ago, the government prepared to send Allied forces to Finland. The possibility of reaching Finland depended on the assistance of the Norwegian and Swedish governments. We felt that even if they tacitly allowed the Allies to pass through, Germany would use it as an excuse to launch an invasion, so we prepared troops to assist them in an emergency. I did not ignore this matter and anticipated that the Norwegian ports of Trondheim and Narvik, as well as the Stavanger airfield, were at risk of being bombed. Therefore, we prepared additional troops to occupy these locations. However, I must state that the orders given to the commanders of these troops stated that they could only advance and occupy these locations under one or two conditions: either they were invited by the Norwegian government, or Norwegian neutrality had already been violated. The House is aware that the governments of Norway and Sweden refused to allow troops to pass through their countries by land. After a period, most of the troops that had been concentrated were disbanded because they and the ships transporting them were needed elsewhere. However, about a month ago, the government decided to keep a small number of troops ready to occupy the western Norwegian ports upon receiving orders if Germany took aggressive action against Norway.</p>
<p>The Outbreak of War</p>
<p>Some may ask why, since Britain had this preparation, Germany was still able to take the initiative. The answer is simple: it was a long-planned and thoroughly prepared conspiracy to deal with an unsuspecting and almost defenseless people. We had known for many months that the Germans were concentrating transport ships and troops at various Baltic ports. These German troops were frequently practicing boarding and disembarking. Although it was quite clear that the Germans were planning some kind of invasion, these troops could also be used to attack Finland, Sweden, Norway, the Netherlands, or Britain, so it was impossible to determine in advance where they would strike. Even if we had known earlier that Denmark and Norway would be invaded, we could not have prevented the event without the cooperation of those two countries. However, we firmly believed that their neutrality would save them from disaster. They were completely unprepared and did not give us any warning that they were under attack. In fact, they never suspected it. We should remember that in early April, the British government decided that it could no longer tolerate Germany's continued use of Norwegian territorial waters as a supply route for iron ore and other contraband. It decided to lay mines in three locations on April 8, forcing Germany to abandon this shortcut and go out to sea in order to intercept them. What may be considered strange is that the British government's decision for this major action on April 8 almost coincided with the date chosen by Germany to launch the attack.</p>
<p>Destroying the Enemy Navy</p>
<p>The Prime Minister then recounted that on April 7, intelligence was received that a large number of German ships were moving towards the west coast of Norway and proceeding along the coast. He reiterated the battle between the British battleship Renown and the German battleship Scharnhorst, as well as the first naval battle of Narvik. He continued, "In view of the chaotic situation in central Norway and the importance of occupying Narvik, the first British force that we quickly assembled set sail directly for the Narvik area. They arrived there on April 15. By that time, the British Navy had attacked and won on April 13, completely destroying the enemy navy in the port. This made it unnecessary to use the troops originally intended to occupy Narvik. Our decision to continue operations had three objectives: (1) to do our utmost to assist Norway, (2) to resist or delay the German advance from the south, and (3) to facilitate the rescue of the Norwegian King and government." If the British army could occupy Trondheim, these objectives could be achieved very quickly, and we decided to work hard to achieve it. (Applause) Therefore, we selected two landing sites north and south of Trondheim. Today, I cannot describe in detail the fighting on these two lines after the British troops landed. All I can say at present is that our troops fought with courage and determination, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy. However, the Allied forces in these two areas are now encountering serious difficulties, the most significant of which is that all available airfields have fallen into enemy hands. We had anticipated this difficulty in advance. For this reason, we were unable to use fighter planes. A few days ago, we learned that due to the German's air superiority, the artillery and tanks necessary for us to resist the enemy's attack from the south could not be transported ashore. Therefore, last week, we decided that we must abandon the plan to seize Trondheim from the south and that we must withdraw the troops in that area to another location."</p>
<p>Strategic Retreat</p>
<p>It is generally acknowledged that retreating in the face of the enemy is the most difficult military maneuver. But this time, we were very fortunate, thanks to the assistance of a powerful navy, the determination of Major General Paget, commander of the British army in the area, and the courage and alertness of our troops. We have now evacuated the entire army from Åndalsnes. Although German aircraft were constantly monitoring, to my knowledge, not a single British soldier was lost in this operation.</p>
<p>Casualties Not Significant</p>
<p>I cannot yet inform the House of the number of casualties in each battle. However, considering the scale of the operation, I dare to believe that the number of casualties is not significant. What satisfies me is that although our troops were unable to occupy Trondheim due to great difficulties, compared to the advantages held by the enemy, the advantages currently held by the Allied forces are still superior to those of the enemy.</p>
<p>German Objectives Not Achieved</p>
<p>The Prime Minister continued, "The German army initially hoped to enter Norway peacefully and occupy the entire country. Now this hope has been thwarted. After three weeks of fighting, the enemy has suffered heavy losses on land, sea, and air. The complete occupation of Norway and the large supply of iron ore previously obtained by Germany from Narvik have now been indefinitely suspended. During these three weeks, the German navy suffered heavy losses, including two battleships, three or four cruisers sunk, three of which are confirmed, eleven destroyers sunk, five submarines sunk, and a total of thirty transport and supply ships sunk, scuttled, or set on fire, resulting in thousands of lives lost. Another ten transport and supply ships were hit by torpedoes and sunk. During this period, the Royal Navy lost four destroyers, three submarines, one small warship, and five fishing boats. In addition, five warships were damaged by air attacks, and one supply ship was sunk by enemy torpedoes. Based on these figures, the Royal Navy's strength has been only slightly diminished, while the German navy has suffered enormous damage. This has altered the comparative strength of the navies and allowed the Allied main fleets to make important reallocations. Previously, we could not divide our forces to defend the Mediterranean because we needed a strong navy in the North Sea. Now we can do so. Therefore, British and French battleships, cruisers, and auxiliary ships have arrived in the eastern Mediterranean and are proceeding to Alexandria." In short, we have not achieved our objectives, but the Germans have not achieved their objectives either, and their losses are far greater than ours. (Reuters, 2nd)</p>

<p>Tokyo: A spokesman for the Foreign Ministry stated today while receiving newly arrived reporters that Foreign Minister Arita's informal meeting with US Ambassador Grew on April 26 would prompt them to continue talks. However, this matter has not yet been definitely planned. On the evening of April 26, Arita invited Grew to a banquet, taking the opportunity to resume informal talks to discuss various issues between the US and Japan that had been delayed due to Foreign Minister Arita's busy schedule. The talks lasted three-quarters of an hour, but he declined to disclose the nature of the talks. Asked if the Japanese side had prepared for a meeting between US Commissioner to the Philippines Sayre, who arrived in Tokyo yesterday, and Arita, the spokesman replied that the Japanese side had not made such preparations because the US Embassy had not made this suggestion.

<p>Tokyo: The Miyako Shimbun reported that Japan may begin negotiations with various countries to conclude a defense pact to prevent Far Eastern countries from being drawn into the European war. It is reported that the Japanese government intends to make efforts to maintain the status quo of Far Eastern countries that have direct or indirect relations with European powers and to prevent them from being drawn into the war. (Reuters, 1st)</p>
<p>Tokyo: The Kokumin Shimbun predicted today that the positive intentions contained in Foreign Minister Arita's statement on April 15 regarding the Dutch East Indies would also apply to British India and French Annam. The newspaper said that Arita's statement indicated that in order to maintain its policy of non-interference in the European war, Japan could not be indifferent to the expansion of the European war to East Asia, nor could it ignore the political and economic changes caused by the belligerent countries in various East Asian countries in the status quo. Britain and France now have a tendency to extend their mobilization plans to various East Asian countries, as evidenced by the arms agreement between India and Vietnam announced on April 29. (Reuters, 1st)</p>
<p>Tokyo: Today, a spokesman for the Foreign Ministry, in response to questions from reporters from various newspapers, stated that the reports in the Kokumin and Miyako Shimbun that Foreign Minister Arita's principle of invoking his statements on April 15 regarding the Dutch East Indies, French Vietnam, and British India might be applied to indicate that Japan, even in the midst of the European war, is deeply concerned about maintaining the status quo of the above countries are all unfounded and idealistic. The spokesman also responded to the question of whether the Japanese government was prepared to conclude a non-aggression pact with the Philippines, saying that Foreign Minister Arita had stated in response to questions in the last Diet that the Japanese government was prepared to conclude mutual non-aggression pacts with various countries in the South Seas. Therefore, the Japanese government is prepared to conclude such an agreement with any other country, not just the Philippines. However, no substantive negotiations have yet begun, nor is a multilateral convention under consideration. (Reuters, 1st)</p>

<p>Chongqing: The Ministry of Economic Affairs recently issued a circular to economic circles nationwide to strengthen the economic warfare front. The original text of the circular is as follows: Regarding various enterprises in war zones or near war zones, the Ministry has previously formulated restrictive measures, which have been circulated for compliance. As the Japanese puppets attempt to seize various economic enterprises, they often use the name of returning private property to entice people to cooperate with them. If the organizers of various companies and enterprises are misled by their plans, it will not only harm private rights and interests but also endanger national resources, with far-reaching consequences. The restrictive measures for various enterprises in war zones or near war zones stipulate that any change of name or transfer, mortgage, or alteration of rights and interests for those engaged in fisheries, mining, forestry, and obtaining special business licenses, any transfer or mortgage of real estate, any change of name of shareholders in various companies, any transfer or mortgage of shares, and any contracts or agreements entered into by organizers or representatives of various companies or other enterprises with foreign merchants regarding rights and interests must be submitted to the Ministry for approval, otherwise they will be invalid. It is hoped that the organizers of various enterprises and the shareholders of various companies will strictly abide by the nine measures, adhere to justice, and avoid falling into treacherous schemes and regretting it later. This is of utmost importance. (Telegram, 2nd)</p>

<p>London: Labour MP Noel-Baker asked the Prime Minister in the House of Commons last night whether he could confirm to the House that the British government would not conclude a new agreement on the disposal of silver deposits in banks in the Tianjin Concession without the consent of the Chinese government. Under-Secretary of State Butler replied that what Noel-Baker asked about was the silver deposited in a Chinese bank in the British Concession in Tianjin. At every important stage of the negotiations on this matter, the British government consulted with the Chinese government and will continue to do so in the future. (Reuters, 2nd)</p>

<p>London: The War Office recently announced that the Allied forces have expanded their occupied area in Narvik, and the war is progressing satisfactorily. There have been no changes on the front lines in the southern Sossus region. In the Donbas region, British troops were fiercely attacked by enemy forces and retreated to their predetermined positions after determined resistance. (Reuters, 1st)</p>
<p>Stockholm: A local radio station has just announced that British, French, and Norwegian troops have consolidated their positions around the port of Bergen, and the German troops there are being withdrawn to the Eidsvoll area. (Havas, 2nd)</p>
<p>Paris: Military personnel here have recently discussed the situation of the war in Norway, summarizing it as follows: (1) Fierce fighting has been taking place in the Donbas area since yesterday, and is still ongoing. (2) When German troops advanced towards Storlien, they encountered resolute resistance from Norwegian forces. In addition, a group of volunteers from Scandinavian countries had just returned to Norway from Finland and immediately went to the front lines to assist in blocking the advance. The German troops were therefore hindered and unable to continue advancing. (3) The claims that Røros and Tynset have been recaptured by Norwegian forces have not yet been officially confirmed, but it is certain that Norwegian forces have the upper hand in those areas. (4) The German side is experiencing great difficulty in establishing contact between Oslo and the port of Trondheim. (Havas, 2nd)</p>
<p>Berlin: German troops advancing south from Trondheim have made contact with German troops advancing north from Oslo. This is of great military significance. The German troops stationed in Trondheim no longer depend on air and sea transport and can directly transport military supplies and reinforcements from the Oslo area. (Haitong, 1st)</p>
<p>Berlin: Today's German war report stated that fierce battles have taken place several times between Oslo and Trondheim. British troops have withdrawn from the Åndalsnes area, and countless military supplies and equipment have fallen into the hands of the German army. 300 Norwegian soldiers were captured by the German army 40 kilometers southwest of Åndalsnes. They were covering the retreat for the British army and were unable to escape. All railways between Donbas and Ulvsborg are under German control. German troops advancing eastward from Bergen and German troops advancing westward from Oslo met along the railway line. No particularly important events occurred in Narvik and Trondheim. The German Air Force continues to bomb enemy forces landing in various parts of Norway. British naval forces near Narvik were attacked by German aircraft, and a cruiser was hit by bombs, with heavy smoke and intense flames visible from high altitudes. The sound of explosions was very loud. A British freighter was sunk and six were severely damaged. Several British aircraft were shot down. No special events occurred on the Western Front. (Haitong, 2nd)</p>
<p>Berlin: A German military officer said this morning that a small skirmish occurred last night at Klingen, 50 kilometers northwest of Donbas. More than 300 Norwegian soldiers were captured. Our army advanced northwest from Oslo and has now reached Sognefjord. In the Valdres area, in addition to capturing 290 horses, 3 field guns, and 85 machine guns, we also captured 300 officers and 3,200 soldiers. (Haitong, 2nd)</p>
<p>London: The British War Office recently stated that British troops in Donbas, Norway, are fighting bravely and have stopped the enemy's advance. British troops north of Steinkjer have once again demonstrated their superiority in reconnaissance warfare and inflicted heavy casualties on the enemy. French troops have landed along the Norwegian coast. (Reuters, 1st)</p>
<p>Stockholm: It is reported that the German withdrawal from Røros was due to the disruption of their transportation line at Rena, which is located about 20 miles north of Elverum in southern Norway. It is generally believed that the Norwegian reports of the retreat of German vehicles from the Tysset to Kvikne highway are credible. (Reuters, 2nd)</p>
<p>Stockholm: According to indirect information, the Norwegian army resisting the German advance inland from Bergen has received reinforcements from the Allied forces. In joint operations, they have driven the German army out of Kvamsøy (eastern end of Hardangerfjord). The Norwegian News Agency stated that the Norwegian army attacked Røros from the east at 5:00 AM yesterday and recaptured it. There were some foreign volunteers in the Norwegian army. (Reuters, 2nd)</p>
<p>Stockholm: The Norwegian News Agency here recently stated that German troops withdrew from Røros, an important town south of Trondheim, on Tuesday night, and Norwegian troops immediately entered the town at that time. According to captured German soldiers, the German retreat was due to insufficient supplies. It is reported that German troops are also withdrawing from Tynset, which is 25 miles from Røros. (Reuters, 2nd)</p>
<p>Paris: According to sources in Stockholm, a small number of Norwegian troops who have been defending the Hegra Fortress for more than three weeks have now reportedly made contact with Allied forces. (Reuters, 1st)</p>
<p>Stockholm: According to information obtained here, Allied forces along the railway and south of Donbas are being reinforced. These new forces recently landed at various points between Trondheim and Bergen. There were reports of fighting in Hegra yesterday morning. German mechanized units, after overcoming snow-covered and dangerous roads, rushed to Hegra from the mountains. Another German unit departing from Tynset was blocked by Norwegian forces at Kvikne, 15 miles from the railway. The German command stated that the German troops who had made contact between Støren and Trondheim referred to this army. The German troops on the Steinkjer front, without waiting for the support of reinforcements from the south, suddenly launched a fierce attack on the French and Norwegian positions on both sides of Snåsavatnet, using heavy artillery and aircraft as cover, but were eventually defeated. According to the Norwegian military command, the German army suffered heavy losses in this battle. The reason for their hasty attack without waiting for reinforcements was probably due to the approaching warmer weather. As the climate warms, the river ice melts, the water rises, and the roads are flooded, making it difficult to use mechanized units. (Reuters, 1st)</p>
<p>Berlin: The German High Command issued a war report today stating that German troops operating in Norway continue to advance in all directions. Fighting continued in the Trondheim area yesterday. The number of Norwegian soldiers surrendering in the Lillehammer area is even greater than the previous day. All are officers and soldiers of the Norwegian 2nd Division, including 200 officers and 3,500 soldiers. 7 cannons, 125 machine guns, and 150 intact vehicles were captured. In the mountains near Rommen, between Vågå and Sognefjord, 1,200 Norwegian soldiers surrendered to our army. Our air force again bombed British warships in Namsos, and two bombs sank a British anti-aircraft cruiser. Another cruiser was hit by a bomb and destroyed. A destroyer and five transport ships were also hit and sunk. When British aircraft went to Stavanger for an air raid, eight aircraft were shot down by our anti-aircraft guns and fighter planes. When British aircraft bombed Fornebu Airport near Oslo, one aircraft was shot down by us. (Haitong, 1st)</p>
<p>Berlin: According to the German High Command, German troops pursuing the enemy in Gudbrandsdal have reached Donbas, an important railway and highway center. German troops advancing south along the railway from Trondheim to Donbas have occupied Oppdal. Important railway centers between Oslo and Trondheim have all been occupied by the German army. (Haitong, 1st)</p>
<p>German Airfield Attacked Again</p>
<p>London: This morning, a British pilot detailed the night raid on Stavanger Airfield on Tuesday evening, saying, "I witnessed a British aircraft dropping a bomb that hit the runway in the airfield, and I saw another British aircraft drop multiple heavy bombs near the intersection of the runways. Two of the first batch of British aircraft immediately flew away over the sea. Six German Messerschmitt fighters fiercely attacked them." The pilot continued, "When my aircraft flew to about two miles from the coast, two German Messerschmitt fighters flew to attack. The rear gunner in my aircraft immediately concentrated fire on the right side of one of them, and the aircraft caught fire and fell into the sea. The other aircraft, seeing this, fled towards the coast. Soon, another Messerschmitt fighter flew over and engaged my aircraft in combat for thirty minutes. The German aircraft was hit by several bullets and fled with injuries. After I flew back to base, I inspected the fuselage and there were no damages." Another bomber pilot said that he saw a hangar and dropped several bombs on it, with at least two hitting. (Reuters, 2nd)</p>
<p>Hitler Commends His Generals</p>
<p>Berlin: German Führer and Supreme Commander of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, Hitler, issued an order yesterday commending the troops fighting in Norway, stating briefly that the rapid advance of the German army has established land communication between Oslo and Trondheim, and the Allied attempt to prevent the German occupation of Norway has also failed. The close cooperation of the army, navy, and air force has created the highest honor for the German army. To express the gratitude of the German people, the German Führer awarded the Iron Cross to General Falkenhorst, the commander-in-chief of the German army in Norway. Medals will also be awarded to other officers and soldiers who have fought bravely after their commanders report them. (Haitong, 1st)</p>
<p>British Newspapers Comment on the War Situation</p>
<p>London: According to special dispatches published here today, most London newspapers are emphatically stating that the Norwegian war has reached a critical stage. The Times' editorial is titled "The Setback at Trondheim," and the Daily Telegraph says that anyone who studies the news of the Norwegian war will feel that the Allied war effort in that area has clearly been poor in recent days. Those who read the war reports in the newspapers in detail will understand this even more clearly. The Daily Herald asks the authorities to inform the public of the true situation of the war. The News Chronicle says that the British Army, Navy, and Air Force should urgently unify command so that they can achieve cooperation and make decisions quickly. The Times' editorial said that even if the German troops in Oslo and Trondheim have not yet met, it is now certain that it is only a matter of time. The Allied hope of quickly cutting off and annihilating the German troops in Trondheim has vanished, and the Allied forces fighting south of the city are in danger of being attacked from both sides and cut off. The most important task now is to defend a line that prevents German troops from invading the narrow strip of land stretching from the Swedish border to the North Sea and far into the Arctic Circle. The Allied forces must place a strong army and air force behind this line and make their strength sufficient to overcome the advantages initially held by the enemy and enable them to take the offensive against the enemy at an appropriate time and eliminate the enemy from Norwegian territory. At present, the procedure for expelling the invaders must take longer than originally expected when the navy initially won. However, people everywhere do not slacken in their efforts to save Norway from the abyss of suffering. The Daily Telegraph said that the main element of the Allied spiritual strength is that their governments all feel that they must not conceal the truth when the situation turns critical. In the history of various countries, no one is as determined in battle as Britain and France. The Norwegian war situation needs to be dealt with, lest the Allies lack determination. Today's situation is only a change in the second battlefield, and it has not developed as we hoped. The Daily Mail's editorial, based on the speech by Liberal Opposition leader Sinclair in the House of Commons yesterday, urging the government to take active action in the Norwegian war, said that today's decision must be made by the Allied Chiefs of Staff and cannot allow political reputation to influence this decision.

<h3 id="e31">US Department of Commerce Releases Report: Japanese Economic Structure is Weak, Efuci Rejects "East Asia Bloc" Theory, Says Japan is Not Yet Economically Self-Sufficient <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>Washington: The US Department of Commerce released a report on the state of the Japanese economy in 1939, stating that Japan's economic structure is becoming increasingly weakened due to the war in China. Japan's focus on the war in China has had a detrimental impact on various other developments, such as economic instability, increased currency issuance, inflationary trends, lack of goods supply, reduced labor efficiency, and a large increase in national debt. Military production has increased industrial output by 5% compared to 1938, but the continued expansion of general industrial output has been hindered by insufficient supply of electricity and coal, lack of labor, reduced efficiency of machinery, and scarcity of key raw materials. The most satisfactory aspect of the Japanese economy is the improvement in agricultural conditions, such as the increase in the value of rice, wheat, and silk. However, prices have increased the cost of living for workers by 15.3% compared to 1938, while workers' earnings have only increased by 10% compared to 1938. In 1938, Japan's national debt increased by 30%, totaling US$5,595,000,000. In other words, it has more than doubled the debt amount before the war in China, and the debt absorption capacity has weakened, which is a cause for concern, as it is expected that Japan will issue US$1,500,000,000 worth of national debt in 1940. Since the outbreak of the European War, Japan has adopted a plan to crack down on speculation, regulate prices, and inspect shipping, but it is generally believed that Japan cannot enjoy all the benefits of the trade opportunities provided by the European War. (Reuters, 30th)</p>
<p>Tokyo: Efuci, a member of the Japanese House of Peers and former ambassador to the United States, who is known for his close ties to Britain and the United States, recently published an article in "Diplomatic Times" dismissing the theory of Japan, China, and "Manchukuo" forming an "East Asia Bloc" to seek economic self-sufficiency as "a daydream." He stated briefly that after carefully studying the Japanese economic life, it is known that Japan cannot survive economically without maintaining strong relations with foreign countries.

The US President recently took action to prevent Danes and Norwegians from withdrawing their deposits in the United States.

<h3 id="e36">Mediterranean Situation Tense, British Far East Merchant Ships Change Routes, British Government Instructs All Ships to Detour Around the Cape of Good Hope, and Orders Prohibition of Royal Airplanes Stopping Overnight in Italy <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>London: According to news from Cairo, Egypt, the Egyptian government has taken precautionary measures due to the unstable situation in the Mediterranean. Shipping companies in Port Said and Suez have received notifications stating that British merchant ships that previously passed through the Suez Canal should now detour around the Atlantic Cape of Good Hope and enter the Indian Ocean. However, the British Naval Headquarters declared that traffic between ports along the Mediterranean coast is not subject to this measure. In addition, British merchant ships currently in the Indian Ocean have been ordered to detour around the Cape of Good Hope to return to their home country. (Havas, 1st)</p>
<p>London: After the British government implemented a precautionary plan in the Mediterranean, ships sailing from Britain to the East and the Far East will likely change their route around the Cape of Good Hope instead of loading large quantities of goods at Mediterranean ports. Even if British ships load goods for Naples, Italy, and Marseille, France, these goods may have to be transshipped by non-British merchant ships. Now the shipping companies of Port Said and the Suez Canal have received notifications that British ships will change their route around the Cape of Good Hope. However, it is heard that this precautionary plan will not cause all British ships to withdraw or change their route. Each ship's journey will be considered separately based on its circumstances, and the special needs of the goods it carries and the political situation at the time of departure must be considered. The British naval authorities in Cairo stated that British shipping within the Mediterranean will not be affected by the government's plans. Four days ago, British ships returning home north of Aden were allowed to enter the Mediterranean. However, since then, British ships in the Red Sea have been notified to detour around the Cape of Good Hope to return to Britain. A Reuters diplomatic correspondent learned from reliable sources that the British government's decision is an indication to Italy that the recent remarks made by Italian newspapers and spokespersons in the political circles are contrary to the spirit of the British-Italian Gentlemen's Agreement. It is particularly unfortunate that Italian newspapers suddenly changed their attitude when British-Italian commercial talks were about to take effect. One of the agreements being negotiated will stipulate that Italy builds ships for Britain in exchange for British coal. (Reuters, 2nd)</p>
<p>Paris: Regarding the British merchant ships stopping navigation in the Mediterranean Sea, well-informed sources here recently stated that the British government's adoption of this measure is to express that no matter what happens in the Mediterranean, Britain and France are prepared for any eventuality. Recently, Italy has adopted various methods to demonstrate anti-British and anti-French sentiment, so this British measure is necessary. Moreover, the Italian authorities allow the German Embassy in Italy to spread rumors that a pro-German figure in Italy, namely Farinacci, the former secretary-general of the Fascist Party, will succeed Ciano as Foreign Minister, and Bismarck, the counselor of the German Embassy in Italy, will succeed Mackensen as the ambassador to Italy. It is also said that the Italian government's appointment of Alfieri as ambassador to Germany yesterday is a prelude to the reorganization of the cabinet, so that pro-German figures can occupy important positions. Although these points are not substantial, Britain and France have to prepare for them in advance, because if Italy and Germany cooperate militarily, an incident is bound to occur in the Mediterranean. (Havas, 1st)</p>
<p>Rome: Imperial Airways of Britain, whose airmail planes fly to various destinations in the Near East and Middle East, has canceled Rome as a stop and will now stop in Athens, Greece, or Marseille, France. (Havas, 1st)</p>
<p>London: Reliable sources say that the measures the British government intends to take in the Mediterranean are purely precautionary. It is heard that the British government very much hopes that these measures are only temporary. The British government is only making these necessary precautions in view of the possible future situation in the Mediterranean. (Reuters, 2nd)</p>
<p>Rome: The British government took further precautionary measures yesterday, ordering Royal Air Force planes not to make their usual overnight stops in Italy. This order was issued following this week's order to British ships to stop sailing through the Mediterranean. It is widely believed that this order is the result of Italy's recent Jaron's implication that Italy might join Germany in the war. London's order prohibiting Royal Air Force planes from stopping in Italy was issued hours after British Chargé d'Affaires Sir Charles held talks with Italian Foreign Minister Ciano. (United Press, 2nd)</p>
<p>Rome: The Italian authorities seem to have decided to punish those who publicly sympathize with Britain and France. For example, a certain member of the Fascist Party was recently referred to disciplinary action by the party cadres for giving a speech praising Britain and France. Another journalist who had written articles criticizing Germany is currently being investigated by government authorities for punishment. (Havas, 30th)</p>
<p>London: There are rumors that Germany has concentrated a large army on the border of Yugoslavia, and Italy has also concentrated troops on the border between Albania and Yugoslavia. Reliable sources from the capital of Yugoslavia have denied this. As far as the responsible persons in that country know, the German army stationed in Klagenfurt, Austria, is only four divisions, with 300 to 400 aircraft. As for the Albanian border, the Yugoslav authorities have taken normal defensive measures due to the geographical situation. In addition, although the Yugoslav government has recruited reservists to enlist, officials and residents in general are able to remain calm. (Havas, 1st)</p>
<h3 id="e37">Italy Temporarily Will Not Abandon Non-Belligerent Status; Not a Combatant Nation; Mussolini Meets with US Ambassador; Near East Treaty Nations to Hold Meeting <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>Rome Mussolini met yesterday with US Ambassador Phillips. It is reported that the US Ambassador visited Mussolini due to the international situation. What they discussed is still unknown. However, according to US sources, this meeting gives the impression that Italy will not change its non-belligerent stance in the coming days. The British Chargé d'Affaires in Italy, Charles, met with Italian Foreign Minister Ciano for a long time yesterday. It is said that the conversation was quite harmonious. British figures in Rome believe that the decision of British ships not to travel through the Mediterranean does not reflect a change in the relationship between Britain and Italy or issues of common interest. Although the full meaning of this British decision is not fully understood by the Italians, they will certainly deeply understand the seriousness of the situation because of it. (Reuters, 2nd)</p>
<p>Washington The State Department recently stated that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini has provided assurances to US Ambassador to Italy Phillips that Italy does not intend to abandon its non-belligerent status temporarily. There are no more than two reasons for this: one is that Britain decided to order all merchant ships to cease sailing in the Mediterranean, and the other is that Italy is not yet prepared, economically, militarily, and psychologically, to immediately assist Germany in the war. However, according to the US military and political circles, Prime Minister Mussolini still has the possibility of weighing his own national interests and changing his attitude at any time. If Italy decides to assist Germany in the war, its people, although generally unwilling to be enemies with Britain and France, will follow Prime Minister Mussolini's lead. Diplomatic circles say that at this time, Germany is exerting great pressure to request Italy, and strongly emphasizes the situation of the Norway-Czech war, which has proved that the German air force's power is above the British and French navies. Italy does not seem to be completely persuaded by this, and will continue to maintain an ambiguous attitude as far as it can, but is willing to support Germany for various indications that prove the Germany-Italy axis is solid and unbreakable. (Havas, 1st)</p>
<p>London Members of Parliament and those close to the British government here are pessimistic about the situation in the Mediterranean. They say that although it is rumored that Prime Minister Mussolini has provided assurances to the US Ambassador to Italy Phillips, no reliable news has been received from Rome to confirm this. Although Italy's attitude is still hesitant at this time, or even intends to "hesitate and retreat" because of Britain's warning (referring to the British merchant ships ceasing sailing in the Mediterranean), Italy's policy has already entered a path from which it is difficult to turn back. This is the view generally held by British authorities. Therefore, the government has already conducted talks with the Turkish government to deal with Italy's intervention in the Balkan Peninsula.

<p>Vatican Authoritative circles learned this morning that the Pope is preparing to seek understanding and cooperation between Italy and Britain, based on the following four key points proposed by Italy. It is said that the meeting between British Foreign Secretary Halifax and Italian Ambassador to London Bastiani last Friday was planned by the Pope. Sources in the Vatican said that if Italy can protect its satisfied demands, it will be willing to reopen friendship negotiations with Britain. The four key points are: (1) Italy's position in the Mediterranean should be changed; (2) Britain should guarantee Italy's interests in the Balkans, without being undermined by British economic pressure there; (3) Britain should recognize the alliance between Italy and Germany. If Britain attempts to subvert the Nazi regime in Germany or dismember Germany, Italy will not "sit idly by"; (4) Italy's future maritime trade will not be obstructed by the British blockade.

<p>London Reuters diplomatic correspondent has learned that London has received reliable information that several German armed patrol boats, disguised as cargo ships, have now arrived in the Lower Danube. It is reported that several of them are currently docked at the Bulgarian port of Ruse. London believes this is a move by Germany to disregard the Danube Commission. Before this news came out, Hungary had put forward a suggestion, suspected to be instructed by Berlin, advocating that the security affairs of the Iron Gate narrow passage of the Danube should be entrusted to an international fleet, which of course included German ships.

<p>Nowadays, there are fewer women who can be called "old" than before. Fifteen years ago, judging from a woman's appearance, 38 years old could be regarded as the end of youth and the beginning of middle age. But what about now? The transition period for women from youth to old age has almost been extended by ten years. Nowadays, women generally do not show signs of aging until they are 48 years old. In other words, take the current 18-year-old new movie star, Boni, for example, her youthful appearance can last for another 30 years. What about before? It was only 20 years. The "youth" of 30 years mentioned here for Ms. Boni refers to her private life. If it refers to her appearance in the films, with the modern various wonderful makeup techniques, lighting, and photography techniques, her youth can be maintained longer than in her private life. In terms of private life, not only Ms. Boni, but any charming 18-year-old girl can have 30 years of youth - ladies, if you want a beautiful appearance, please use Da Xi face powder; if you want white teeth, please use Da Xi toothpaste.

<h3 id="e44">May Day Labor Day; Moscow Grand Parade; Military Parade Held in Red Square; Voroshilov Delivers Speech <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>Moscow On May Day Labor Day, an unprecedentedly grand parade and review was held here. The review ceremony began at noon in Red Square. Stalin, Molotov, Kaganovich, Kalinin, Andreyev, Mikoyan, Shvernik, Beria, and members of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, chairmen of various People's Committees, all ascended the podium of Lenin's Mausoleum. As for the representatives of the Moscow Soviet, Red Army and Navy commanders, Soviet heroes, diplomatic corps personnel, and foreign journalists, they were seated on another platform. The reviewed troops were commanded by Soviet Marshal Budyonny, and the People's Commissar of Defense Voroshilov stood in front of the troops and delivered a speech, saying,</p>
<p>"Currently, only the Soviet people can celebrate this Labor Day with enthusiasm. The Soviet people are proud of the achievements of Soviet socialism. At the same time, they are particularly satisfied that they have not been involved in the Second Imperialist War."</p>
<p>"To this day, the people of capitalist countries must more deeply recognize the difference between capitalist and Soviet countries. Under the leadership of Lenin, Stalin's party, and the great Stalin, 183 million Soviet people are working hard to build their socialist life. The Soviet Union does not want to join the war, but is ready to fight at any time."</p>
<p>The defeat of the Finnish Defense Forces and the destruction of the Mannerheim Line have proven the strength of our people and the glory and bravery of the Red Army.</p>
<p>"The current international situation is extremely complicated. The Second Imperialist War has gradually expanded. Agitators are now trying to drag us into this bloody massacre, and even attack our territory when the opportunity arises. Therefore, we must be ready to deal with everything at any time. We must redouble our efforts to strengthen the defense of our motherland and consolidate the strength of the Red Army and Navy. We must complete this task in the spirit of Bolshevism, and the completion of this task is guaranteed by the will of our 183 million people and the wise Lenin-Stalin Party."</p>
<p>The troops were praised by the guests for their neat steps during the review. At the same time, the Red Army and Navy commanders also passed the review platform to pay tribute to Stalin and his comrades. Behind these commanders were students and instructors from military academies.</p>
<p>The most noteworthy thing was the infantry's procession. Their neat steps and majestic spirit received unanimous praise. At this time, armed members of the laboring masses entered the field. They were textile workers, railway employees, scientists, and artists, carrying long guns and full of spirit, indicating that they were ready to rise up and defend their motherland at any time.</p>
<p>More than 600 aircraft perform new tactics</p>
<p>After the infantry were cavalry, machine gun teams, artillery teams, and motorcycle teams. After that, the air defense forces also held a demonstration, showing the thoroughness of the Soviet Union's air defense. The Red Army's new weapons were also shown during the review. The various artillery pieces showed great power when they passed by. The orchestra, with more than 1,000 people, had a majestic and moving tone. Tank and armored vehicle teams galloped through Red Square, attracting attention. There were as many tanks as carp crossing the river. The large Red Square could hardly accommodate them. Three aircraft performed in the sky at this time, with novel postures never seen before. At the same time, various aircraft, in teams of nine, performed in the sky over Moscow. The fighters and bombers that were performed at that time were very new, and they were as fast as thunder during the performance, and the audience was overwhelmed. A total of 634 aircraft participated in the performance. (TASS, 1st)</p>
<p>Moscow After the Red Army was reviewed in Red Square on Labor Day, the laboring masses entered the field one after another, holding slogans and flags, and held a grand parade. First were the factories and cultural figures, followed by athletes. They all paid tribute to Stalin and his comrades, and cheered for their leaders, with voices shaking the sky. In the slogans and slogans, they expressed their respect for the heroic Red Army and were ready to deal with everything. Slogans were everywhere, fully supporting the Soviet Union's neutral policy.</p>
<p>The parade of the laboring masses lasted for four hours, showing the political unity of the Soviet people and their support for the party and Stalin. (TASS, 1st)</p>
<p>Soviet Defense Commissar Issues Proclamation on May Day</p>
<p>Moscow Soviet Defense Commissar Voroshilov issued a proclamation today for Labor Day, saying,</p>
<p>"Today, our people celebrate May 1st, which is a memorial to review the achievements of our laboring masses. This year, the Soviet Union should celebrate this memorial day in a solemn manner, because in addition to the great achievements in socialist culture and peaceful work, the Soviet Red Army has also added glorious victories to the motherland."</p>
<p>Although Britain and France attempted to drag us into the European war, thanks to the wise policies of the government and the party under Stalin's leadership, our country was fortunate not to be affected. The war waged by the British and French groups against Germany has now tended to expand, and new countries have been involved in the war. At the same time, in the Far East, the war is also continuing. Regarding our country's foreign policy, it has been explained by our head of state Molotov in the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, and has been approved by the Supreme Soviet. This Bolshevik foreign policy is very clear. Its main purpose is to guarantee the peace of all countries and the security of our country. This policy is guaranteed by our country's treaties with various countries, and is also supported by our 183,000,000 people and armed comrades. Last autumn, the Finnish government became a plaything of "powerful" protectors. Not only did it fail to sign a friendship treaty with our country, but it also waged war against us.</p>
<p>The Soviet government immediately took steps to protect Leningrad and our northwestern border. As a result, the Finnish Defense Forces have been fatally struck by the Leningrad Military District troops, and the so-called Mannerheim Line has also been destroyed. The Mannerheim Line was built by imperialist experts, engineers, and staff, and was a military base for preparing to attack the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>The Mannerheim Line and the Maginot and Siegfried Lines are the same. The line is built with hundreds of strong bunkers, machine guns, artillery, tunnels, landmine traps, tank vehicle nets, and various other obstacles. War instigators believed that the line was an impregnable fortress, and that any army would be defeated, but under the serious blow of the Leningrad District troops, it was eventually shattered. Stalin once said that as far as the Bolshevik Party is concerned, there is no impregnable fortress in the world, and this statement has now been proven.</p>
<p>In this war, Soviet Red Army officers and political personnel have not only fully demonstrated the morale of the Red Army and the greatness of Soviet military equipment, but have also proven that the Red Army can make good use of its weapons in any environment. In addition, in addition to defeating the Finnish army, the Red Army has also defeated the imperialist armed forces that attempted to turn the Finnish war into a world war. The war in recent days has given the Red Army new experience in war. We should study this new experience, correct our shortcomings, and continue to enhance our strengths. Bolsheviks do not have the habit of sticking to the old ways. We should not feel complacent about our victories. The times are progressing, therefore, the Red Army must continue to enhance its strength, and should strive for perfection in terms of military knowledge.</p>
<p>Imperialist war instigators must still threaten our country with war, therefore, we should be prepared at any time and improve our combat power to repel any enemy that attacks our motherland. Also, Soviet Navy Commander Kuznetsov issued a proclamation, pointing out the political significance of Labor Day and the achievements of the Soviet Union in recent years. The text reads, "The Soviet Baltic and Northern Fleets have completed their tasks at the same time as the Red Army, defeating the Finnish Defense Forces, and the government has commended the naval achievements."

<p>Chongqing Foreign Minister Wang Chonghui delivered a broadcast speech on the International Shortwave Radio Station at 12:20 today. The topic of his speech was "Defending Culture." The gist of his speech was that the "government" in Nanjing cannot succeed, because the Chinese people have already deeply understood its true meaning and know that this government is controlled by the Japanese. The purpose of the Japanese invasion of China is not only to enslave the 450 million Chinese people, but also to eliminate Chinese culture and replace it with Japanese militarism. However, this policy will inevitably fail. No matter what the Japanese do, our final victory cannot be shaken. Any action by the Japanese, even if it is decorated with a Chinese-style appearance, will eventually fail, because the Chinese masses have deeply understood the Japanese intentions and have resolutely engaged in saving the country with their manpower and financial resources. Even women at the front line do not hesitate to volunteer to undertake the work of destroying roads and building defenses. Today is Labor Day, and the world's workers should celebrate it in an atmosphere of peace. But now we cannot talk about this, because the masses of people are currently suffering from the pain of war. Peace is indivisible, and this is a natural principle. Unless Japan's invasion of China is stopped, there will never be hope for peace in the world. China's resistance is not only defending China's own independence and its own culture, but also greatly helping the restoration of world peace and order. (United Press, 1st)</p>

<p>Hong Kong The situation in Macau is very tense. Although the Portuguese and Japanese authorities have repeatedly denied it, it has been confirmed by visitors from Macau. Last week, two Macau Indian policemen were shot dead by soldiers holding Japanese flags on Lapa Island. Another Indian policeman and a Portuguese policeman from Shanghai were injured. Last Sunday, a motor ship loaded with armed Japanese soldiers landed on the coast of Macau, causing great panic among the residents. The Japanese soldiers went directly to the business center of Macau to enter large hotels to gamble on fan-tan. Nearby Chinese merchants, banks, and shops immediately closed their doors. The Portuguese military police authorities rushed to send armed military police to guard important locations until the Japanese soldiers left in the evening. Although no accidents occurred, it has left a very bad impression on the residents. It is heard that many wealthy Chinese in Macau intend to move to Hong Kong, so the demand for Hong Kong dollars is extremely high, resulting in a sharp drop in Chinese currency. (Reuters, 1st)</p>

<p>(7) Implementation Situation</p>
<p>(1) Establishment of Adult Classes: According to the results of a renewed survey, there are 2,798,875 adults in the province who should be enrolled in school. According to the prescribed number of people per class, 63,395 adult classes must be set up throughout the province. In addition to setting up adult classes in basic schools at all levels, secondary schools and above, and other cultural and industrial organizations, each county also sets up at least two demonstration adult classes in specially designated secondary schools or central basic schools with excellent performance, as a demonstration for general adult classes.</p>
<p>As for the establishment of adult classes for special ethnic groups in various counties, it is handled in accordance with the "Provisional Measures for Adult Education for Ethnic Groups in Guangxi Province." It is jointly handled by teachers of national basic schools in the villages and streets where they are located, and one class is conducted per period until it is completed.</p>
<p>(2) Phased Implementation: The implementation of adult education is limited by teachers and textbooks, and for the convenience of supervision, the adult classes in the province are generally divided into four phases. However, the environment in each county is very different, and those that are divided into districts and phases each month are handled separately. Generally speaking, each county can complete the process as scheduled according to the predetermined progress. The number of adult classes and students in each phase in the province is as follows: (Phase 1) 662,217 people enrolled, 18,172 classes, 9,086 teachers, 531,383 graduates, started on March 16th and ended on May 15th; (Phase 2) 657,665 people enrolled, 18,165 classes, 9,083 teachers, 520,14 people graduated, started on June and ended on July 31st; (Phase 3) 632,863 people enrolled, 17,196 classes, 8,598 teachers, started on August 16th and ended on October 15th; (Phase 4) 522,435 people enrolled, 14,401 classes, 7,201 teachers, started on November 1st and ended on December 21st. The total number of enrollments above is 2,474,180, 67,934 classes, and 10,550 teachers, starting from March 16th and ending on December 30th. (Note: (1) The total number of teachers refers to the total number of teachers transferred from various counties and who have received short-term training. (2) The number of graduates in the 2nd and 4th phases is temporarily missing because the war in southern Guangxi affected the reporting of various counties.</p>
<p>(3) Work Review: In order to provide practical problems with the experience of adult education workers, and to increase educational efficiency with the purpose of brainstorming ideas, the "Measures for Phased Discussion Meeting of Various Adult Education Programs" are formulated, stipulating that each county shall convene local adult class teachers and county adult education supervisors within one week after the end of each adult class session to hold discussion meetings. Adult class teachers must submit work reports before the meeting as a reference for studying problems. The discussion matters include the equipment of adult classes, student enrollment and organization, curriculum, teaching materials, teaching, training, continuing education, and adult education for special ethnic groups, and the work of the next adult class is planned. Adult education in each county has made much progress after each review meeting. The problems of the first and second phases of adult classes are rarely present in the third and fourth phases, and the results of the third and fourth phases are far better than the first and second phases. The effectiveness of the review meeting can be seen in general.</p>

<h3 id="e69">Foreign Exchange Fluctuations Drastically Yesterday, Government Decides to Stabilize Currency, Stabilization Fund to Be Significantly Increased, US Loan to China Highly Likely, Japanese Conspiracy Fails, Speculators Also Profitless <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>When Dr. Monroe, a leader of the American business community in Shanghai, visited Shanghai on the 26th and 27th, he reviewed China's financial problems. Fearing that American businesses would be excluded from trade with China in North China, he was deeply concerned that the Japanese would imitate the measures implemented in Tianjin in Shanghai and use the worthless paper of the pseudo "Central Bank" as a tool to attack the legal tender. On the 30th of last month, he sent a telegram to Secretary of State Hull, suggesting that a huge loan be given to China to stabilize China's currency system and consolidate China's finances. This would not only protect American trade with China, but also boost the morale of the Chinese people and strengthen China's position. Dr. Monroe is preparing to lobby after returning to the United States to make it happen. This news spread, and there were rumors that Britain would no longer maintain the stabilization fund, and that the value of Chinese currency would fall in the future, so the United States would come out to maintain it. Until yesterday, the Shanghai foreign exchange market experienced drastic changes and the situation was extremely chaotic. It cannot be said that this drastic change was caused by the above-mentioned proposal, but the turmoil happened at this time, which should be the most important issue for Chinese and foreign people. The information obtained from yesterday's investigation is recorded below:</p>
<h3 id="e70">Stabilization Committee Continues to Maintain <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, the leaders of the banking community in this city received a private telegram from Hong Kong. According to people close to the financial authorities, the Central Government has always maintained the exchange rate of legal tender in Shanghai through the Stabilization Fund Committee. The two previous contractions of the foreign exchange black market were to combat Japanese conspiracies and crack down on speculative activities. Now the Central Government has decided to increase the foreign exchange stabilization fund, and it is expected that the foreign exchange market in Shanghai will stabilize. The black market exchange rate of legal tender has been very stable for several months, and recently there has been a loosening trend. It is heard that the Central Government intends to increase the Shanghai Fund by 5 million pounds in British currency and 7.8 million US dollars. If this news is true, then this suspension of supply is purely to crush the positions of speculators, and foreign exchange can be gradually released, while those who blindly speculate will only suffer the consequences.</p>
<h3 id="e71">United States Will Never Stand Idly By <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>According to an economic expert yesterday, the center of gravity of American interests in China is in Shanghai. Whether it is investment or trade, almost all of it is concentrated in Shanghai. Since Japan has controlled trade in North China, American businesses have no room for development in Tianjin. Shanghai is the main market for American goods. At present, sales of American goods in Shanghai account for 75% of American exports to China, and exports from Shanghai to the United States also account for more than 80% of the country's goods shipped to the United States. Unless the United States is willing to withdraw from the Chinese market, it will never allow the Japanese to manipulate it. The reason why the Japanese have been hesitant to destroy the legal tender and abuse control is that they know there are concerns.</p>
<h3 id="e72">Financial Market Yesterday Morning, Suddenly Unprecedented Chaos <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>Crazy Rise Within Two Hours</p>
<p>The English-language Greater America Evening News said that the exchange rate of legal tender fell sharply this morning (2nd). Yesterday (1st), the average exchange rate of legal tender against the US dollar was 16.5 yuan, but this morning it rose to 20.75 yuan within two hours. It only recovered slightly an hour before noon. The closing price at noon was 20 yuan in legal tender, equivalent to one US dollar. When the market opened this morning, the exchange rate between Shanghai and New York was 5.9625 yuan. There were only buyers and no sellers. Then the news that HSBC and Markali refused to sell foreign exchange spread throughout the city. Obviously, the Sino-British Stabilization Fund had stopped interfering in the Shanghai black market. Buyers' bids became higher and higher, causing the US exchange rate to shrink to 4.9375 yuan for spot goods and 4.6875 yuan for May futures. Some sellers then dumped their goods, but it is not known whether their dumping was due to the resumption of work by the Stabilization Fund. The buying trend in the market is still strong, but it is more cautious. By noon, the New York exchange rate had eased slightly, and the closing price was 5.125 yuan for spot goods and 5 yuan for May futures. The future of the market in the afternoon is unpredictable. As the US exchange rate has shrunk unprecedentedly, the British exchange rate has also shrunk to 3.5 pence, which is the lowest record in August last year.</p>
<p>Yen Exchange Rate Also Fell Simultaneously</p>
<p>The banking community in this city was strongly impressed by the fall in the exchange rate of the Japanese yen against the legal tender. At noon, 100 Japanese yen could still be purchased for 125 yuan in legal tender. 100 yuan of Japanese military currency only required 124 yuan of legal tender to be purchased. Therefore, the yen exchange rate in this city is "only slightly more than one-quarter of the official exchange rate in Tokyo." The development of the foreign exchange market this morning immediately had a strong impact on other markets. The Stabilization Fund or its representative bank did not explain the reason for suddenly withdrawing support from the foreign exchange market, causing various rumors to arise, and reliable information could not be obtained. The saying that the United States is about to assist the legal tender has not been confirmed, but it is generally believed that the United States will take measures, at least to assist, the legal tender traded within "Free China."</p>
<p>Gold Price Reaches Unprecedented Peak</p>
<p>Cash was also greatly affected yesterday, creating a crazy surge. The market opened yesterday morning with an astonishing phenomenon, rising to 6,800 yuan, a sudden jump of 1,072 yuan compared to the closing price of 5,728 yuan the day before. However, it soon fell sharply by 800 yuan, followed by a flying rise to an unprecedented peak of 7,000 yuan. Afterwards, it fell again to 6,300 yuan, and when the market closed at noon, it fell back to 6,260 yuan. Decorative gold was only 100 yuan higher, at 650 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e73">Serious Situation Created, Various Rumors from Outside, Financial Community Says Two Major Reasons <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the black market situation in this city's financial sector was extremely tense. The financial community believes that the creation of this phenomenon is based on two important reasons: (1) Because HSBC and Markali banks stopped supplying foreign exchange for a time to prevent the Japanese from engaging in large-scale arbitrage, there were doubts about the Stabilization Fund. (2) In view of the sharp increase in Shanghai Customs' trade deficit in the past few months, according to investigations, the national trade deficit in the first quarter of this year was 900 million yuan calculated at the black market exchange rate, and 250 million yuan in Shanghai alone, which led to a sharp increase in the demand for foreign exchange in Shanghai. (The saying that there is a trade surplus is calculated based on the legal exchange rate and does not have accurate figures).</p>
<p>External Speculation Absolutely Unreliable</p>
<p>In the market yesterday morning, there was another rumor that the reason why the black exchange rate had undergone drastic changes and suddenly tightened was that it was rumored that the pseudo "Central Bank" was about to be established. However, according to reliable sources yesterday, this news is extremely difficult to confirm, and the authoritative side also stated that even so, its impact on the exchange market would not be so great. The reason why the exchange market suddenly tightened was mostly due to the sharp increase in this city's trade deficit. According to the banking community, the need for foreign exchange in this city has suddenly increased in the past few months, and the reason for this increase is nothing more than the sharp increase in the quantity of imported goods in this city. The sharp increase in the quantity of imported goods is enough to make Chinese and foreign merchants in this city buy and pay for the goods no matter how high the exchange rate rises.</p>
<p>Japanese Buying Large Amounts of Foreign Exchange</p>
<p>In addition, the banking community also stated that in addition to the increased demand for foreign exchange in this city, the amount of foreign exchange that the Japanese have purchased with legal tender in the past few months is also quite alarming. In the past, the Japanese used customs revenue as a source of arbitrage for foreign exchange. According to estimates by the general public, the Japanese exchanged tens of millions of yuan of legal tender for foreign exchange in the past four months. This may be another reason for the sudden tightening of the exchange market.</p>
<p>New York British Exchange Rate Also Fell</p>
<p>Reuters, New York, 1st. Due to the uncertainty of the Norwegian situation and Britain's decision to reroute cargo ships around the Cape of Good Hope, the New York British exchange rate fell successively this morning. The pound opened at 3.485 yuan and recovered slightly at 3.49625 yuan at the close. Yesterday's closing price was 3.50875 yuan. The French franc opened at 1.98375 yuan and closed at 1.98125 yuan. Yesterday's closing price was 1.99 yuan. Foreign public bonds were sold quite actively, and the price of Italian public bonds fell due to the increased tension between Britain and Italy.</p>
<h3 id="e74">International Relief Society Ends Operations, Reception Center Closed, Donations No Longer Accepted <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai International Relief Society issued a public notice to all sectors yesterday, stating that the society's work of providing relief to refugees will soon be three years old. A total of six large-scale reception centers, two refugee hospitals, one street children's education center, and one refugee children's middle school have been established successively, accommodating a total of more than 100,000 people. Fortunately, people from all walks of life have been compassionate and have provided continuous assistance. The Standing Committee of the Society has previously decided to close the affiliated reception centers on April 30. All refugees, except for the elderly, weak, disabled, and those who have no one to rely on, will be resettled separately, and the rest will be given generous severance pay. The severance procedures have been completed, and from May 1, the Society will no longer accept donations from all sectors. It is also scheduled that on June 1, the Society's head office will move to the Huayang Yizhen Society on the fourth floor of No. 97 Renji Road to handle the closing, compile an annual report, and distribute it to all sectors for credibility. This is to inform you and express our gratitude.</p>
<h3 id="e75">The Stability of the Legal Tender and the Abundance of the Stabilization Fund <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>The Determination to Maintain the Currency System Was Already in Place</p>
<p>The Chinese government has always held the greatest determination to maintain the stability of the currency system and foreign exchange. Now, more than two years into the war of resistance, the legal foreign exchange rate remains as before, namely one shilling, two and a half pence for the British pound and thirty yuan for the U.S. dollar. The government still provides as much as possible for the legitimate needs of various industries. As for the black market exchange rate in Shanghai, the Exchange Stabilization Fund Association also provides appropriate maintenance, and does not stop supply due to the manipulation of speculators. This situation has been proven by facts for some time. The fund itself is still substantial, and the claim that it has been used up is purely unfounded.</p>
<p>Lower Exchange Rates Benefit Exports</p>
<p>According to general observations, the sudden tightening of the black market exchange rate seems to be closely related to the future of the legal tender. It is believed that the future of the legal tender can be determined by the drastic changes in the black market exchange rate. The most significant reason for the sudden tightening of the black market exchange rate is the rumor that problems have occurred with the Exchange Stabilization Fund. The so-called Stabilization Fund is intended to facilitate foreign trade, but in the end it has led some people to profit from it, resulting in the current chaotic and bad situation. According to authoritative sources, it is believed that the value of Chinese currency is currently developing along natural lines. If we take this as an observation point, it is closely related to foreign trade. Considering the sharp increase in imports over the past few months, the trend created by this, when calculated nationwide, has become a phenomenon of continuous increase. Therefore, the decline in the value of Chinese currency seems difficult to prevent by human effort, but it is not entirely unfavorable to China's overall foreign trade, because the fall in the exchange rate can reduce imports of foreign goods and increase exports of domestic goods, and the two may still tend towards equilibrium in the future.</p>
<p>The Stabilization Fund Remains Abundant</p>
<p>In addition, we must also pay attention to the fact that the policy of the so-called Stabilization Fund is not to prescribe a fixed exchange rate for the Chinese legal tender, so as to avoid excessive expenditure of the Stabilization Fund. However, if we think that the Stabilization Fund provided by the two major British banks has a fixed amount, then this judgment is actually a misunderstanding. This can be proven by the recent analysis report of the two banks, because the two banks can also obtain profits from selling and buying in the foreign exchange market. Therefore, we can assert that the Stabilization Fund will not only not be exhausted, but the two banks can continue to find ways to maintain or expand its amount.</p>
<p>Speculators Will Find It Difficult to Profit</p>
<p>The foreign exchange transactions in April have already been settled. It is reported that speculators have entered into between seven and eight million U.S. dollars in May futures. Judging from the current operation of the Stabilization Fund, the long side has no profit to make at present, and the same will be true in the future. Most of the U.S. dollars entered were purchased when the exchange rate was low, and in the future they will have to grit their teeth and sell them off, or be willing to pay a fee to exchange them for June futures, hoping that the environment will be favorable at that time. These speculators believe that the exchange market will only shrink and not rise, so the news of the increase in the Stabilization Fund has destroyed their hopes.</p>
<h3 id="e76">Today's May Third Memorial: Citizens are Encouraged to Strive, Strengthen their Belief in Resistance and Nation-Building, Unite as One, and Practice Spiritual Mobilization, Saving and Disaster Relief Through Thrift <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>Today is the 12th anniversary of the Jinan Massacre and the martyrdom of Cai Gongshi. All sectors of the city, due to the special circumstances and in accordance with the central government's regulations, will not engage in extravagant activities, but will commemorate this painful massacre spiritually. In order to support the resistance and build the nation, they will practice spiritual mobilization, saving and disaster relief through thrift. Because on the "May 1st" Labor Day, a large number of leaflets supporting resistance and nation-building and patriotism were found in the Hongkou, Zhabei, and Nanshi districts, the Japanese sent a large number of artillery vehicles and armored vehicles to patrol the areas separately from 10:00 a.m. yesterday. Japanese and puppet police have been added to the bridges in Hongkou District and the iron gates in Nanshi District, and they have conducted extensive searches of pedestrians and vehicles. Therefore, in recent days, there have been very few people traveling to and from these areas.</p>
<p>A Letter from the Shanghai Municipal Party Department to Citizens</p>
<p>The Shanghai Special Municipal Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang issued a letter to the citizens regarding the "May 3rd" Massacre, saying: Time flies, and May 3rd has arrived again. Twelve years ago, around this day, the Japanese warlords, in order to prevent the Northern Expedition of the Revolutionary Army, launched a massacre in Jinan. The invaders painstakingly planned to swallow China in one gulp. From the Sino-Japanese War to the present, they have not hesitated to create a series of bloody debts, also wanting to swallow China. "If China does not perish, aggression will not stop." This sentence speaks to the hearts of the Japanese warlords, and also explains the causes of their launching various massacres and incidents. In the past two years and ten months, for the freedom and liberation of the nation, for the survival of the motherland, for not wanting to be the descendants of a conquered nation, and for liquidating the long-unpaid blood debts of the Japanese, under the leadership of President Chiang, we have launched an unprecedented all-out war of resistance. Today, the war of resistance has tied down the Japanese, and their fighting spirit has declined. Panic and war-weariness are everywhere in the country. These are precisely symbols of the invaders shooting themselves in the foot and embarking on a dead end. Because the invaders have no way to end the war militarily, with the end of the war far off, they use puppet organizations to divide the forces of resistance. This is their last card, which they have always regarded as a rare commodity. Little do they know that they have bought fake medicine in the gourd, and hoping that it will work is simply wishful thinking. Dear citizens, the Japanese war of aggression is on the eve of collapse, and its last card has also appeared. At the same time, the all-out war of resistance under the leadership of President Chiang, after two years and ten months of tempering, has revealed the glimmer of victory. The facts tell us that the last five minutes of struggle are the key to determining the overall situation. From now on, we must strengthen unity and strengthen resistance and nation-building in order to strive for the freedom and liberation of the nation and the country. Only by strengthening unity and strengthening resistance and nation-building can we crush aggression and liquidate decades of blood debts.</p>
<h3 id="e77">The Chinese Army on the Qinghu Road Achieved Significant Victory. Most of the Japanese Troops in the Yangtze River Estuary Were Transferred to the Front Lines. It is Reported that the Japanese Troops Stationed in Zhudi Have Withdrawn <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>The English-language "Great American Evening Post" reported that, according to reliable sources, the Japanese army suffered heavy casualties in its brutal anti-guerrilla warfare in western Shanghai. The guerrillas, because the Japanese army massacred villagers and burned villages, bravely came forward to retaliate. With the help of the peasants, they counterattacked the Japanese army in various places. Their actions were swift and flexible, and it is said that they have achieved significant victories. On Sunday and Monday, a team of Japanese troops was cut off by guerrillas in the Songzhu area of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway and suffered a heavy blow. The Japanese army urgently dispatched a large increase in troops, resulting in the area being filled with Japanese troops in some places. In recent months, the number of Japanese troops stationed in most towns along the Yangtze River has been greatly reduced, because most of them have been sent to the front lines for reinforcement, and have been transferred to the "Peace and National Salvation Army" to show non-assistance. Since the outbreak of large-scale guerrilla warfare, the Japanese army in central China has been exhausted and feels a great lack of manpower. Although the Japanese army has destroyed villages and towns on a large scale in an attempt to eliminate the base areas of the guerrillas, the guerrillas continue to operate. On Tuesday evening, the Japanese side sent several ambulances to the North Station to pick up the wounded Japanese soldiers from the guerrilla area.</p>
<p>Withdrawal of Japanese Troops</p>
<p>On the 26th of last month, about 1,000 Japanese troops went to the towns of Zhudi, Panlong, Jiwangmiao, and Guanyintang in western Shanghai and were stationed separately in these places. It is now reported that yesterday (the 1st), about 200 Japanese troops stationed in Zhudi forcibly gathered all the residents of the town in one place. Those who were afraid and avoided were beaten. After the Japanese puppet leaders gave "comforting speeches" to the gathered residents, the Japanese troops immediately withdrew to Shanghai. It is said that the Japanese troops stationed in other towns will also withdraw in the near future.</p>
<p>On-Site Inspection</p>
<p>The "Continental News" reported that Qingpu District, five miles west of Shanghai, has recently been poisoned by the Japanese army. On Sunday, five British and American journalists from this city went to the area to investigate and witnessed twelve villages burned to the ground and injured and killed villagers. The heart-wrenching scenes and photos of the burned villages have all been published in the "Continental News". The spokesperson of the Japanese Army in this city yesterday (the 1st) denied burning more than one village and killing women and children.</p>
<p>Covering Up the Facts</p>
<p>It is said that Qingpu District is a nest of Communist guerrillas, and the anti-Japanese sentiment is extremely strong. Moreover, guerrillas disguised as villagers killed several Japanese soldiers. A team of Japanese troops began military operations against the guerrillas on April 14, with the aim of completely eliminating the Communist elements. The Japanese army conducted household searches and found many Communist elements disguised as farmers, and seized a large number of military weapons and ammunition. The Japanese army acted with extreme caution, so the claim in the anti-Japanese newspapers that civilians, including women and children, were killed is not true. There was only one village that caught fire, and the guerrillas who killed the Japanese soldiers had their headquarters in the village.</p>
<p>Raising Funds for Burial</p>
<p>Now there are seventeen people, including Zhang Jinxiang, who have launched a campaign to raise funds to bury the exposed corpses. The notice says: What is more heartbreaking in the world than dying without a burial place and exposing bones in the wilderness? Those who suffer may be unaware in the underworld, but how can those who see it not feel pain in their hearts? This time, the northern countryside of Sijing Town suffered a tragic massacre by a certain army, which has been recorded in various newspapers. Innocent farmers have suffered this great calamity, corpses are everywhere, and the stench is overwhelming. Is there no danger of causing an epidemic? Jinxiang and others, in view of this, will rush to collect and bury the corpses everywhere as soon as possible, but the cost is very high. Feeling inadequate, we have to widely solicit donations. If so, the ownerless lonely souls will suffer less from the dismemberment of corpses, and the common people in the wilderness will not suffer from the disaster of the epidemic. This is a win-win situation. If benevolent people are willing to donate generously, then not only will the dead receive great kindness, but the living will also receive infinite blessings. This is an appeal. Also, the previous report that Magistrate Lu of Qingpu County led his troops to surrender to the puppet regime has been corrected by the county government, which stated that it was completely untrue.</p>
<h3 id="e78">Hu Siting Was Shot Dead. It Is Reported that There Was a Nature of Revenge, Involving the Bloodshed at the Wangjiasha Law School. It is Said that Hu Once Sniped Chen Jinbiao <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>At No. 1081 Jing'an Temple Road, Daxia University, at about 1:08 p.m. the day before yesterday, a sudden assassination occurred. The person shot was Hu Siting from Kunshan, 19 years old, a freshman in the law department of the school. He was hit by two bullets in the chest on the spot and died immediately. All the details have been recorded in the newspapers.</p>
<p>One Person Was Detained, Also a Student</p>
<p>According to Pingming News Agency reporters, after Hu fell to the ground after being shot, the shooter sneaked out of the school gate and fled along Jing'an Temple Road. At that time, he did not hide or abandon the gun he was holding. Two Chinese constables, No. 58 and No. 134, saw him and immediately pursued him, and as a result, they arrested the assassin and detained him in the Jing'an Temple Police Station, and then escorted him to the Central Police Station on Simalu. The pistol and bullet casings were also sent to the General Police Station for examination. It is said that the assassin is also a young man, one of the students of Daxia University, named Chen Yiping (but inquiries with the school authorities deny that there is such a student). The motive for the assassination is said to be revenge. The reason is that Hu Siting shot Chen Jinbiao, a student of the Shanghai Law School, on Aivenyi Road in the Wangjiasha Garden on April 12. He and Chen were close friends, and being moved by righteousness, he could not let him survive, so on that day he walked from Jing'an Temple Road into the Daxia school building and shot Hu directly. He did not give any verbal warnings beforehand. Currently, the police station is investigating the deceased Hu Siting's past political activities at the school and his relationship to the Wangjiasha bloodshed.</p>
<p>The Deceased's Unusual Activities on Weekdays</p>
<p>Hu Siting's father, named Wenkai, has been an editor at the Commercial Press, earning only a few dozen yuan a month, and his family is poor, so he lives very frugally. It is said that the son used to rent a room in a building on Aiduya Road under the name of the Sichuan Fellow Association as a cover, and internally specialized in a certain kind of work. Later, it moved to Cishu Building and was renamed the Shanghai Jiangbian Compilation and Translation Society. It held meetings once a week from 7 to 9 p.m. every Saturday. In the past, Hu also served the Party and the country and embraced the Three Principles of the People, but suddenly changed his attitude and secretly engaged in unusual activities.</p>

The Police Are Investigating Strictly <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>In front of the Taichang Woodware Company Manufacturing Factory at No. 433 Yuyuan Road in western Shanghai, a kidnapping case suddenly occurred at about 2:15 p.m. yesterday.

<p>The saying that Shanghai Xi gambling dens would be banned has long been rumored. Although a number of casinos, such as Guangsheng, Shenji, Xiangsheng, Rend, Jing'an, and Zhuan, were closed down last month, the larger ones were still operating as usual, and their business was more prosperous than before. Therefore, the small gambling dens that were closed down were actively discussing ways to deal with the situation and trying to resume business, but the Japanese side has not yet given a definite reply. On the morning of the day before yesterday (May 1), the director of the "Gambling Den Supervision Department", Yamaki, and the Chinese "chief in charge", Pan Sansheng, ordered four casinos, including Fusheng, Dasheng, Lianyi (that is, Kai Xile), and Xinxin, to close down. It is said that the owner of Fusheng is more flexible in his methods. It is said that he will resume business in four days, but according to news from the Japanese side, the existing casinos such as Hollywood have also been ordered to suspend operations within a certain period of time. As for the "Chinese General Association" in Jing'an Temple, because of its special license, the "Department" has no right to deal with it. It is said that it can be extended for six months.</p>

<p>A large number of gambling dens in Nanshi were banned by the Japanese military police because of a bloody incident in the Heng'an gambling den in Heng'an Lane. It is now known that the ashes have been re-ignited and are plotting a revival, because large gambling dens such as Sanxin on Minguo Road have spent a huge amount of capital, so it is no small matter to try. Therefore, in the bustling areas around the refugee area, there are 14 gambling dens preparing to appear in a new guise and have been successfully dredged. It is said that they will be opened on the 6th of this month under the guise of entertainment venues. However, the flower games have been specially approved to be opened by Mao Axiang, Fang Lingen, Yao Rongsheng, and Cheng Hanqing in Guangfu Temple to draw characters and open large barrels.

<p>Local woman Cao, aged 30, together with a man named Cao Zitian, aged 35, claiming to be her husband, arrived at the Da Fang Hotel at 35 Zhengjia Wood Bridge Street in the French Concession at 11:00 AM on the 30th of last month. They booked room 216 for lodging. At 2:00 PM, the man and woman went out together and returned to the hotel around 6:00 PM in the evening to sleep. The next morning around 6:00 AM, the man Cao Zitian went out alone, leaving the woman inside. She slept until 11:00 AM at noon and had not gotten up. The tea server Xu Dingchang (22 years old, from Ningbo) entered the room to inquire and discovered that Ms. Cao had died in bed. He immediately informed the accounting office, which reported to the French police. Detectives were dispatched to investigate and found what appeared to be strangulation marks on the deceased's neck and her fingernails were blue. The cause of death was unclear, so the body was sent to the Tongren Fuyuan branch morgue for examination. Yesterday, Prosecutor Zhao Changmin from the Special No. 2 Court was requested to come to the morgue to conduct an examination. The examination revealed that Cao had died of poison before her death. Because there was no way to find or summon her family, the official determined that the corpse should be handled by the charity for burial, pending family identification. However, the man who stayed with her, Cao Zitian, claiming to be her husband, did not return to the hotel. It is said that the police department dispatched detectives to investigate and investigate the cause of the woman's suicide. Zhang Yuansheng (28 years old) and his wife Zhang Wang (26 years old), arrived at the China Hotel at 241 Jie Road in the Public Concession at about 4 PM the day before yesterday. They booked room number 5 for lodging. Yesterday, at 11:15 AM, the tea waiter heard moaning from the room. He went to knock on the door, but there was no answer. He managed to pry open the door and saw Zhang and his wife lying on the bed with pale faces, moaning, and barely conscious. He saw an empty bottle of poisonous liquid on the table, indicating that they had taken poison. He immediately reported to the accounting office and summoned an ambulance to take the couple to the hospital for treatment. Zhang Yuansheng died of poisoning before reaching the hospital. Wang's life is also in critical condition. It is said that the reason for the suicide was economic pressure.</p>
<p>Pan Xiang, a young man from Suzhou, age 24, residing at 10 Bie Mo (phonetic) Ten Garden on Long Road, had just graduated from school last year during the winter vacation. He had been suffering from lung disease for four years. He had sought medical treatment repeatedly, even having his kidney removed, but none of the medicines were effective. He felt no joy in life and the future was bleak, so he held a pessimistic view. On the 29th of last month, he suddenly became desperate. That night, at 10:00 PM, he secretly swallowed poison at home to commit suicide. His mother discovered it and searched his bedside and found sleeping pills and an empty iodine bottle. He was immediately sent to Renji Hospital, but the treatment was ineffective, and he died at 2:00 PM on the 1st of this month.</p>
<p>Chen Jingying (29 years old), a Fujian woman, residing at 45 Jianye Lane, Fulili Road, had an argument with her husband at 8:00 PM last night. Afterwards, she swallowed raw opium to commit suicide. Her family discovered it and sent her to the hospital for treatment.</p>
<p>Yesterday, at 2:00 PM, a traveler, Zhang Weixin (20 years old), a local man in Room 213 of the Continental Hotel on Yü Qiaqing Road, jumped from a second-floor window, attempting suicide due to economic pressure.

<p>Yan Zhong, the daughter of Zhong Lu, a woman from Suzhou residing at No. 2, Lane 181, Xiaoshadu Road, 27 years old, was married eight years ago by her parents, through a matchmaker, to Zhi Qian (the son of Yan Jia Zhuo, Zi Junshu, the former Director of the Salt Affairs Inspection Office (i.e., the offspring of Yan Jiachi, Zi Mengfan, the former Director of the Jiangsu Finance Department of the Beijing Government and now the Vice Minister of Finance of the "Central Government" in Nanjing). She lived together at No. 25, Meilefang, Lane 210, Huanlong Road in the French Concession. However, since Yan Zhong married into the family, she has suffered greatly from abuse from her step-aunt and being in an old-fashioned family. Furthermore, her husband was studying at Soochow University in Suzhou, and he was unable to protect her. Unexpectedly, Zhi Qian became weak and went to Peking Union Medical College Hospital for treatment. He repeatedly sent letters to summon his wife to Beijing, but was blocked by his parents. It was not until Zhi Qian was terminally ill that Zhong was able to rush to his bedside. After a brief reunion, he died. At that time, Ms. Zhong's nerves were severely stimulated and she once jumped from the second floor in an attempt to commit suicide. She was rescued and spared from death. When she returned to Shanghai with the coffin, she was refused by her parents. Ms. Zhong took her daughter Qingyi (now eight years old) to Ningbo temporarily to live. It has been more than four years and her parents have not expressed any intention to take her back. She once requested living expenses from her parents and filed a lawsuit in the Suzhou court. The first instance ruled that she could receive more than 3,000 yuan in living expenses, but she lost the appeal. The case is now delayed in the Supreme Court. Ms. Yan comes from a well-known family, knows etiquette, and has received higher education. Being a young widow is already a tragedy in life. Being abandoned by her parents is even more painful. She has been living in Ningbo for four years. Although her parents have no complaints, she feels ashamed to live there for a long time when she occasionally thinks of the old etiquette of "a married daughter is like spilled water". She has no joy in life and nothing to look forward to. In a state of depression, she had suicidal thoughts. On April 26, at 5 PM, Ms. Zhong and her eight-year-old daughter Qingyi simultaneously swallowed three bottles of sleeping pills to commit suicide. Fortunately, the family discovered it early and sent them to the Red Cross Hospital for emergency treatment. The mother and daughter survived. The Jing'an Temple Police Station was notified and sent Detective Xie Futang to investigate. Because she had attempted to kill her daughter, Yan Zhong was sent to the Second Criminal Court of the Special First Court yesterday morning. The police initially charged her with murder under Article 271, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law. After questioning by Judge Fu, Yan Zhong confessed that she often kept sleeping pills because she suffered from insomnia after her husband's death. She had not forced her daughter to take poison and Yan Qingyi also testified that she had taken it herself. Under the defense of lawyer Wang Jianhang, police lawyer Zhang Tianyin also stated that he should be judged in accordance with Article 275 of the Criminal Law for attempting to commit joint suicide. Judge Fu reviewed the confession and sentenced Yan Zhong to be exempt from punishment for attempting to commit joint suicide and inciting suicide. Qingyi was taken back by her maternal grandmother.</p>
<h3 id="e90">Case of Wu Qilun's Murder: Gu Zhuxuan Denies Instigation, All Criminals Have Confessed in the Police Station, Confession Forms Submitted to the Court, Gu Denies the Matter Outright, Adjournment Ordered for Further Investigation <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>The case of Gu Zhuxuan being accused of instigating the murder of lawyer Wu Qilun was heard in the Criminal Court One by Judge Feng Shide of the Special First Court yesterday afternoon. Gu's lawyers Wu Linkun, Jiang Baoli, Jiang Pingfan, and Qiao Yaoshan's lawyer Wang Yaofa were all present in court. First, police lawyer Ru Baoyi stated: The defendants related to the case of Wu Qilun's murder are Wei Shoulin, Wang Xingfang, Xia Shoufeng, Xia Guifu, Zeng Changchun, Qiao Yaoshan, and Gu Zhuxuan, a total of seven people. They are now being prosecuted in accordance with Article 171 of the Criminal Law. Gu Zhuxuan and Wu Qilun were acquainted and very friendly. Previously, Gu's apprentice Wang Xinggao killed Tang Jiapeng, and was arrested by the French police. Gu was also arrested for his involvement in instigating the crime. At that time, Wu Qilun was his lawyer. Afterwards, Gu expressed dissatisfaction because Wu had not done his best. Later, Wu represented Qiu Changyin in a guardianship case. As a result, the case was settled through Gu's mediation. Qiu sent a public fee of 30,000 yuan, but Gu did not share the money with Wu, causing Wu to complain. Gu hated Wu to the core because Wu publicized the matter, which affected his reputation. He discussed with his apprentice Qiao Yaoshan how to kill Wu. Qiao then contacted Zeng Changchun, and then successively found Wei Shoulin, Wang Xingfang, Xia Shoufeng, Xia Guifu, Wei Xiaohu (who was killed by the police in another theft case), and others. After discussion, they decided on a method to kill Wu Qilun and designated Xia Guifu as the executor. However, all the defendants did not know Wu Qilun's true face. Therefore, they sent Zeng to accompany Wei and Xia to visit Wu at his residence at No. 102, Tongfu Road, to handle the defense of Ding Shaokun (who had been arrested by the police for robbery and sentenced by the court). After Xia recognized Wu's face, they agreed to pay 100 yuan in public fees on the morning of March 4. That morning at 11:30, Wei Xiaohu, disguised as a rickshaw puller, pulled an empty rickshaw with a pistol borrowed from a certain organization in Shanghai West (the gun had been used in many cases in the concession). They set off together. After arriving at the destination, Wei handed the gun to Xia Guifu, who went to knock on the door, while the others were distributed to watch the wind. When Xia knocked on the door, Wu Qilun thought that someone was coming to pay the public fee, so he ordered his niece Wu Shaohua to open the door and invite the person into the living room. After only a few words, Xia took out the gun and fired three shots at Wu and fled. Wu died because the bullets hit vital parts. In the beginning, Gu was supposed to pay 2,000 yuan as a reward after the deed was done, but only paid 800 yuan. These facts were all confessed by the defendants, and the confession forms have been made. However, Gu Zhuxuan denied everything in the police station. Therefore, the confession forms were submitted to the court. Then, Wu Shaohua testified about the circumstances of Xia Guifu firing the gun at the time. Judge Feng often questioned Xia Guifu, Wei Shoulin, Wang Xingfang, and Zeng Changchun, and they all admitted to the fact of killing Wu without denying it. By this time, it was already dusk, so the court announced an adjournment for further questioning.</p>

<p>At No. 65, Xue Lane, West of the Sanpailou (Three Memorial Archways) in the city, a three-story house, the tenant Li Amao (from Pudong), who traded in foreign jadeite, had an argument with his wife around 8:50 PM the night before last. Inadvertently, he overturned an oil lamp. Sparks touched the foreign jadeite raw materials, causing the fire to blaze and immediately pierce the roof. Black smoke filled the air and spread to the opposite No. 63, the Guojialou (Guo Family Building), and the houses of the Xie family at No. 1 and the Yang family at No. 2. When the fire was raging, two tenants, Zhu A-San and a young woman Zhu Li, both jumped from the building, seriously injuring their heads. They were later taken to the refugee hospital by ambulance for treatment. The fire department dispatched vehicles from the Northern District Fire Brigade to put out the fire.

<h3 id="e96">Letter <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>To the Editor, We write to inform you that, according to Mr. Liu Huilin of Liu Yanghe Tang Traditional Chinese Medicine Shop, upon reading the news about the fire in Ningxing Street, French Concession, i.e., the Caishi (Vegetable Market) Street, published in your newspaper yesterday, he was greatly surprised that the statements made were inconsistent with the facts. Our shop has been located near Gaochang Temple in Nanshi for over 60 years after moving to the French Concession after the war. The report that our shop was originally located in Hongkou and moved to Caishi Street after August 13th is obviously hearsay and untrue. It is also untrue that the fire was caused by our shop accidentally burning ointment in the kitchen. Our shop usually closes at 9:30 PM every night and turns off the lights at 10:00 PM, so how could such an ointment burning event occur? Furthermore, the report that our shop has huge fire insurance is also inconsistent with the facts. Our shop has capital of more than 20,000 yuan, while the fire insurance is only 3,000 yuan, which is a far cry. The loss is quite large, so how can it be said that we have huge fire insurance? Also, the tenants of the second and third floors of the building leased by our shop, Dong and Bao, directly lease from the landlord Siming Real Estate Department. The report that these tenants sublet from our shop is obviously untrue. We are deeply concerned that this untrue news will lead to misunderstandings from all parties, and we have to entrust your lawyer to send a letter to Shen Bao and Xin Bao to declare a correction. We hereby forward the letter and request your newspaper to make a correction. Sincerely, Lawyer Jiang Chiping, May 2nd.</p>

<h3 id="e98">Finance: Foreign Exchange Market Sees a Big Upsurge Yesterday, HSBC Supply is Thin, Black Market is Chaotic, British Exchange Approaches Four Shillings, U.S. Exchange Approaches Five Yuan Mark <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign exchange market saw HSBC consistently shrinking its quotes. The British exchange rate was revised to 3 shillings and 2.5 pence, and the US exchange rate was posted at 4.6875 yuan. The British exchange rate has reached its tightest quoted price since August 11 of last year, and the US exchange rate even broke the record of 5.5 yuan on September 19 of last year. Other exchange rates also shrank across the board. The domestic market situation was extremely chaotic. After the opening in the morning, rumors spread everywhere, causing unnecessary anxiety. As a result, buying surged, while selling was hard to find, and no transactions were made. There was no definite market price. Around 9:30 AM, it was heard that the British exchange rate was 3 shillings and 2.5 pence, and the US exchange rate was 4.625 yuan. Because HSBC and other foreign banks did not maintain their rates, public panic increased. Later, speculators and Chinese banks took advantage of the high prices to sell long positions, and the market temporarily stabilized. Before the close of the morning session, buying decreased slightly, and there was some relaxation. However, speculators fiercely pushed prices up again in the afternoon, and the tight situation returned. The reason was that foreign banks were unwilling to sell, and the closing results were 3 shillings and 3.75 pence for British exchange and 4.875 yuan for US exchange, a sharp decrease of 75 and 1.0625 yuan compared to the previous day. The futures trend was no different from the spot market.</p>
<p>Market Price Only Available After 9:30 AM</p>
<p>In the morning, the price of large London bars rose by nearly 375, the distant ones increased by 25, the price of silver in New York remained flat, and the price of raw gold in London remained fixed. The exchange rates for British against US, Shanghai, and French currencies were all flat. The US exchange rate fell by 1.5 points against the British, 6 points against Shanghai, and 0.75 points against the French. The central government's quoted prices for various currencies remained the same. The selling prices for spot goods at bank morning closings were still 4 shillings and 125 pence and 5.9375 yuan for British and American currencies, respectively. However, the market was extremely chaotic at the time due to widespread rumors. Moreover, it was heard that HSBC and foreign banks had no intention to supply, so the public was panicked. There was buying in the market but no selling, so there were few transactions. It was not until around 9:30 AM that there was an official market price. British exchange rate was 3 shillings and 25 pence, and the US exchange rate was 4.625 yuan. The HSBC quotes were announced, with the British exchange rate changed to 3 shillings and 25 pence, and the US exchange rate to 4.6875 yuan. Other rates were reduced across the board. The silver balance tax was announced, an increase of 1.75 yuan. It was later heard that foreign banks were doing spot British exchange rate at 3 shillings and 375 pence, but the situation remained uncertain. Later, because Chinese banks and speculators profited from long positions, they came out of the market one after another, and slightly hardened. It is estimated that foreign banks absorbed spot US currency from Chinese banks at 4.8125 to 5 yuan, and soon speculators sold spot US currency to foreign banks already at 5.1875 yuan. The noon closing was still stable, with the British exchange rate being 3 shillings and a half penny, and the US exchange rate being 5.09375 yuan. The British exchange rate for the May contract was 3 shillings and 375 pence, and the US exchange rate was 4.9375 yuan, which was 625 lower for British and 84375 lower for American currencies compared to the morning opening. Futures also shrank drastically.</p>
<p>Still Feeling Insufficient Funds in the Afternoon</p>
<p>In the afternoon, speculator's purchases and tight situation revived. It is estimated that speculators had purchased the May US exchange rate from foreign banks at 4.875 yuan and 4.75 yuan. After all, foreign banks still saw thin supply, and funds were often lacking. Until the evening closing, the situation recovered slightly, with the British exchange rate at 3 shillings and 375 pence, and the US exchange rate at 4.875 yuan. There were no transactions heard for the June British exchange rate being 3 shillings and 25 pence, and the US exchange rate at 4.6875 yuan. Compared to the overnight closing, the spot British exchange rate shrank by 75, and the US shrunk by 1.0625 yuan. This month, British and American currencies each softened by 6875 and 1 yuan.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the prices of British and American currency were rising. The prices of British pounds and US dollars were surging as people crowded to buy them due to the rise in gold prices. The market price had risen by 18.5 yuan compared to before this newspaper's holiday. British gold notes rose sharply to 63 yuan because HSBC Bank abandoned its black market British exchange rate maintenance price of four pence and 125. US dollar notes rose sharply to 19.5 yuan because a certain bank also temporarily stopped supplying the black market US exchange rate. The retail price at the money exchange shops had already shouted above 20 yuan. Hong Kong notes rose sharply with the Hong Kong-Shanghai exchange rate. In addition, for French francs, Singapore, Dutch, Annam, Ruble, Canada, Philippine notes, etc., buyers were also scrambling, and the market prices rose across the board.

<h3 id="e102">The Frenzy of Speculation: Gold Market Soars to the Heavens, Opening at a Peak Price of 6,700 Yuan <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cash "cooked red" (shà chì - slang for speculative) grey market was like a bolt from the blue, suddenly experiencing a horrifying surge. Those who heard of it were dismayed. The main reason was that speculators were spreading rumors, and operators were alarming each other, leading to an extremely tight foreign exchange market. The gold rush also surged accordingly. The market was chaotic in the early morning, opening only at 10 o'clock. Initially, bids reached 7,000 yuan, but the actual price was 6,700 yuan, a jump of 772 yuan. Later, many bullish investors took profits and exited, such as Qian Dui Ye and banks, selling heavily. In an instant, the price fell to 6,200 yuan. However, the situation suddenly improved towards the close, with the after-market opening jumping 190 yuan. This was due to the continued tightness of foreign exchange and the frantic search by gold shops and securities firms. The price even rose to 6,530 yuan, ultimately closing at 6,485 yuan, a sharp increase of 757 yuan compared to the previous day. However, according to the US dollar settlement price for the day, it was still more than 700 yuan lower. The future of gold prices is unpredictable and profound. Observing the increasing expansion of the European situation, if the United States is drawn into the war, gold may inevitably experience a reaction. Bullish investors without real strength should be cautious and prepare for the worst. The total trading volume for the day was about 5,000 taels. Jewelry gold in silver shops surged by 80 yuan, reaching an unprecedented peak price of 660 yuan. Customs gold, etc., remained flat.</p>
<p>"Cooked Red" Jumps 757 Yuan</p>
<p>From the morning, before 9 o'clock, people's minds were still stable. However, when the foreign exchange market opened at 9 o'clock, it was reported that there was a market without transactions, causing panic among the public. To avoid risks, people waited for the foreign exchange market to open before trading, so the market opened half an hour later than usual. Around 10 o'clock, a certain gold shop first bid to sell at 7,000 yuan, but at that time, only another gold shop offered to buy at 6,700 yuan. Soon, the opening price was seen at 6,700 yuan, a rare surge of 972 yuan compared to the previous day. Later, with the disappearance of buyers, the price plummeted by 200 yuan without any transactions. Afterward, with the outpouring from gold shops and silver shops, although a certain securities firm took the opportunity to absorb, the position ultimately felt full, and the price continued to fall by 250 yuan. The securities firm sold 50 taels to the bank at 6,250 yuan. Then, the bank suddenly advanced sharply, and sellers gradually decreased. The price jumped again by 250 yuan, with the bank taking 20 taels from Qian Dui Ye at 6,500 yuan. Later, as foreign exchange eased, a selling frenzy was reignited, and the securities firm suddenly reappeared. Gold shops and Qian Dui Ye also filled in, and soon the price fell back by 300 yuan. Deng Juan firm sold 30 taels to the bank at 6,200 yuan. It was heard that a few transactions were also made at 6,180 yuan, but some buyers with a limit price of 6,200 yuan did not succeed. After 11 o'clock, sellers gradually decreased, and a certain securities firm and bank suddenly started to collect, soaring the price by 190 yuan. The bank took 20 taels from the gold shop at 6,390 yuan. At that time, there were many sellers with a limit price of 6,400, and the price surge was blocked. Then, with the bank's reduced collection efforts, the price fell back by a small 130 yuan. The bank mutually transacted 30 taels at 6,260 yuan as the noon closing price. When the market opened in the afternoon, sentiment was surprisingly good. Gold shops raised prices to buy, jumping 190 yuan. The gold shop took 20 taels from the bank at 6,450 yuan. Later, the securities firm sold, immediately falling back by 70 yuan. The bank did 10 taels, at 6,380 yuan. Eventually, as foreign exchange became tight again, the securities firm suddenly advanced again, and Qian Dui Ye also bought, soaring 150 yuan. The gold shop took 30 taels from the bank at 6,512 yuan. Later, the buying frenzy gradually subsided, and gold shops suddenly intended to sell, filling in somewhat, immediately falling back by 130 yuan. The bank sold 20 taels to the securities firm at 6,400 yuan. Afterward, the securities firm came to search and purchase again, rising again. The securities firm took 20 taels from the gold shop at 6,485 yuan as the late closing price, resulting in a 757 yuan increase compared to the previous day. The price fluctuated by 500 yuan throughout the day. The selling price of cash gold from the main brand of gold shops was several tens of yuan higher than "cooked red," and the purchase price was reduced by 30 yuan. The current premium gold was more than 50 yuan lower than the listed gold, and there were few transactions.</p>
<p>Silver Shop Jewelry Gold Rises by 80 Yuan</p>
<p>The initial selling price of jewelry gold in silver shops was still 580 yuan per tael at Datong Hang. By 10 o'clock, due to the surge in "cooked red," reaching nearly 1,000 yuan, the price was also raised by 70 yuan. At 1 o'clock in the afternoon, it rose by another 10 yuan, resulting in Datong Hang changing the listed price to 660 yuan. The new peers had the same price, and the purchase price was reduced by about 30 yuan. The above prices have all created unprecedented high prices since the market's inception.</p>

<p>The securities grey market yesterday suddenly experienced turbulence due to sudden changes in finance. Foreign exchange suddenly experienced extraordinary changes. In an instant, the US dollar shrank by more than one yuan, and gold soared by nearly 1,000 yuan, which was an unprecedented and strange change. It is said that the Hong Kong Foreign Exchange Equalization Fund Committee has abandoned the maintenance of the standard. All Chinese and foreign banks in Shanghai refused to supply foreign exchange, and there was talk of the establishment of a pseudo-Central Bank. The market's morale was severely impacted by this huge change, and the rapid rise in prices caused panic among most people. The tightness of silver was even worse than five days ago, and there were rumors that several silver shops were unstable. In this tense market situation, public bonds were also affected by these unfavorable news and fell. However, there were also many who wanted to buy before selling. The situation will be clear in a day or two. Yesterday, Tong Kang bought in both the morning and afternoon, especially in the afternoon. The rest were mainly covering short positions. The outflow of spot goods occurred both in the morning and afternoon. In the morning, spot goods were delivered from numbers 12, 20, 22, 35, and 38. Xinfu and Yongkang slightly covered short positions. In the afternoon, Changmao and Lianhe sold in large quantities. Hengfu and number 38 still bought out. The market price rose by several dimes in the afternoon, but ultimately fell by a small two to six dimes. About 120 yuan was transacted. A brief table is listed below:</p>

<p>Coal ball market: Yesterday, due to the sharp contraction of shillings and drastic changes in the foreign exchange market, all factories stopped trading in the morning. An emergency meeting was held in the afternoon, resolving that, effective immediately, the factory price for the industry would increase by 23 yuan. The opening prices for Yitaixing, Nanyang, Guohua coal balls are 158 yuan per ton from the factory, 1.25 yuan per bundle, and 8.5 yuan per dan at the street door shops.

<p>Yesterday, the sugar market experienced a sharp contraction in foreign exchange. Dutch exchange reached 8.750, then rose to 9.500 to 9.375. However, the association in this city drew the line, because the asking price of outgoing clients was too high, resulting in a lack of transactions. The spot price for Four Rivers coarse white new goods at the outer warehouse was 75 yuan, transit goods 60 yuan, Taikoo vehicle white B mark goods at the West warehouse was 85 yuan, and Dutch red 63 yuan. The degree of price increases reached about 10 yuan, so incoming clients were watching, and there were only no transactions. National sugar was also tight. It was heard that Diao Qing would open at 57-58 yuan, up 2-3 yuan, and the rest also asked for increases.</p>

Hearing that Gold Prices Have Fallen Slightly, They Fear They Won't Be Able to Get Rid of It in Time. As a Result, Both Foreign Rice and Japonica Rice Rose by One or Two Yuan <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>Since the previous dynasty, because the expiry date has passed, the sales market of rice has become more prosperous. The prices of various kinds of foreign rice have all risen by one yuan. For example, No. 1 Saigon had already been sold for 47 yuan, and small twisted rice for 43.5 yuan. Yesterday morning, inheriting the upward momentum, people's minds were particularly firm, and buying and selling were quite prosperous. The market immediately saw high prices. When news broke that gold prices had caused an unprecedented surge of 1,000 yuan, the city was instantly filled with storms and rain. People's minds were as if selling parties insisted on not getting rid of the stocks, and they actually came out to turn in the gains they made. The market was agitated for a time, and the shouting was chaotic. The market prices of various kinds of foreign rice increased sharply, with No. 1 Saigon reaching a maximum peak of 49 yuan, No. 2 at 47.5 yuan, and small twisted rice at 46.5 yuan, a sharp increase of three yuan compared to the previous market. From morning to noon, there was no slight setback, and it was not until the close of the market that news suddenly broke that gold prices had fallen back by 400 yuan that the market began to flag. Because the changes were so drastic, the resistance was also strong. If people's minds were not discouraged, then everything was fine, but if they were discouraged, the overall situation would be affected. At that time, everyone insisted on recovering losses, using every means to the extreme. By this time, they were afraid that they would not be able to get rid of the stocks in time, and they returned them one after another, causing a reverse situation to the early market, showing only release and no input, and market prices dropped step by step, suddenly shedding about 1.5 yuan. In the end, the market closed weakly, with a total increase of two yuan compared to the previous increase. No. 1 Saigon was 48 yuan, and small twisted rice was 40-45.5 yuan.</p>
<p>Although there were more than 2,000 packages of thick and thin japonica and other domestic rice arriving, because foreign rice soared, they were able to keep pace. Trading in the market was also changed to an off-market grey market. Because the price was lower than that of foreign rice, transactions were particularly numerous. Although they were also raised with each other, they were ultimately not as large as that of foreign rice, only rising or falling by one or two yuan. Transactions for Xibang special Qing japonica were 48 yuan, general market 47 yuan, powder japonica 46 yuan, Chang Kun white japonica 47.5 to 45.5 yuan, Qing Si special thin 47 yuan wholesale, general market 45-6 yuan, Zhongguan around 44 yuan, Nanhai early rice 45 yuan, special 46 yuan, secondary 43 yuan, Hu Jian 41-2 yuan.</p>
<p>Although the sales market for glutinous rice was not as wide as that of other goods, its price was the cheapest, and there were also large households hoarding and collecting, so market prices were also good. The price of Liyang special yuan was 41.5 yuan, general market 40 yuan, Chang Dan goods from 40 yuan, secondary to around 38 yuan.</p>
<p>Foreign rice was suppressed by the tightness of fourth-bottom funds, making it difficult to rise. In recent weeks, it has been difficult to revitalize. After the fourth-bottom term has passed, speculators are all eager to try, and they were suddenly hit by strange changes in the foreign exchange market. The market has reached a point where it is difficult to stop. The prosperity of the market's entry and exit, and the soaring of market prices, have been rare in recent months. Saigon No. 1 rose from 47 yuan to 49.5 yuan, and small twisted rice was even more prosperous, soaring even more. The opening price was 43.3 yuan, and it rose to 46.3 yuan, a total increase of three yuan compared to the previous day. At noon, many floating investors made profits and released their holdings, suppressing the price by nearly one yuan. However, the spot goods of the relending path were the target of speculators. This rose and that lifted, and the May increase rose to 56.8 yuan, an increase of 4.3 yuan compared to the end of last month. The spot goods had already reached 55.7 yuan, which was also a large increase of over three yuan. The market briefly returned to normal at noon, and then the market rose again in the afternoon, but the main business of those entering and leaving the market was the leather ball business. A total of about 600 tons of returned original packages were transacted, and 8-9,000 packages of spot rice.</p>
<h3 id="e107">Flour Market Turns Firm <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>The flour market turned firm. Although the opening price of the No. 2 flour mill was still 13.5 yuan, the factory was quite likely to raise its prices. Because foreign exchange contracted sharply, the gold market surged, and commodity prices were all driven up. In the morning, old truck brand return goods tightened, and the opening price was over 13.47 yuan. The asking price for the afternoon market was already higher than the factory price. Most of those holding goods were defending the price, intending to wait for a good price, so the total number of transactions for various flours in the entire city was only about 10,000 packages. It was also heard that the customer price for artillery truck was 14.6 yuan, and the low-grade flour No. 4 was 12.4-5 yuan. Customers slightly decorated, but in the afternoon it was heard that the American bank came out to maintain foreign exchange, and the future of commodity prices is unknown.</p>
<p>The wheat market has long been in a flat and soft situation. Because export firms and Japanese factories have been inactive, only Chinese factories are handling affairs. At a time when inventory is drying up, both buyers and sellers are trending toward holding, and sellers are even more determined to sell. It was heard that about 1-2,000 packages of goods delivered to the factory were priced at 21 yuan, but transactions remained deadlocked.</p>
<h3 id="e108">Yarn and Cotton: Yarn Also Soars, Double Horse Jumps 180 Yuan <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market soared, and the changes in the situation were truly astonishing. The difference between the opening and closing prices was more than 200 yuan, and the state of the market was as chaotic as hemp. Due to the frequent news of sudden changes in foreign exchange, the price of 20-count Double Horse yarn for May immediately jumped 200 yuan, to 1,730 yuan. With the 70% price added, it has reached around 1,900 yuan. This situation is frightening.</p>
<p>The morning opening for spot yarn was flat because actual sales were weak and market sentiment was flat. In addition, the high and low prices of 20-count yarn were uneven and far apart. The opening price for 20-count variant horse was 1,465 yuan, a drop of 10 yuan. In an instant, news broke that foreign exchange had greatly changed and gold had soared, and the buying atmosphere suddenly became strong, immediately jumping straight to 1,685 yuan. Later, as those taking profits released their holdings, the price fell back to 1,600 yuan, and then rose again to 1,630 yuan at the close. After checking the transaction statistics for half a day, 2,155 packages were transacted. The market price for 20-count variant horse spot jumped 180 yuan. Two pieces of yarn were shipped to Ningbo today. The amount bought by each party is listed as follows:</p>

<h3 id="e109">Native Cotton Transactions Halted, Many Orders Opened for Indian Cotton <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>Native cotton transactions have completely entered the path of market stagnation. This is because after the drastic changes in the financial market, people's minds were frightened and uncertain, and the public should not trade.</p>
<p>In other news, the market price of foreign cotton, the New York cotton market, was very quiet yesterday, but quite firm. Later, due to the purchase by peers and the activity of some short-sellers, the closing price was higher than the previous day by one or two British pounds. In the Indian cotton market, yesterday's forecast fell by more than one rupee, and Egypt rose by more than ten British pounds.</p>
<p>The transaction of foreign cotton in Shanghai continued to be lively as usual, especially Indian cotton. This is because the selling price of Indian cotton is cheaper than American cotton. Because the spot goods in the market have been searched and emptied by all parties, there are many who ordered Indian cotton. All are ships departing from Western India on the 6th. Because the ships depart from Western India, the freight is relatively guaranteed. The following is the factory price converted at a rate of 6 yuan per US dollar for yesterday's cotton market:</p>
<h3 id="e110">Piece Goods: Hoarding Eastern Piece Goods, The Rise is The Fiercest, The Leading Spot Good, Dragon Head Fine Cloth, Raised to 53 Yuan <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>Domestic Cloth: Yesterday, the sharp contraction of foreign exchange stirred people's hearts. Because of the small sales of cloth, the thoughts of cargo owners were different, so the market was extremely chaotic. Transactions of white cloth coarse cloth, fine cloth, and fine twill were traded at original prices and at increased prices of 5 dimes to 1.5 yuan. Later, the prices rose uniformly. The domestic peers traded more than 500 pieces, and the customer sales were still clear. The morning market searched and entered more than 300 pieces at a low price, which was also a hoarding nature.</p>
<p>Eastern Cloth: The rise was the fiercest, and the transactions were also the largest. The white cloth fine cloth and fine twill, internal and external traders searched and hoarded more than 2,000 pieces. Dragon Head fine cloth rose by 5.5 yuan per piece, and mid-range miscellaneous brands and fine cloth rose by about 3 yuan per piece. At the close, the spot price of Dragon Head fine cloth was 53 yuan, and the futures price was 54.5 yuan. The spot price of Sijunzi serge increased to 1.55 yuan per yard, and the futures price increased to 1.625 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e111">Market Situation Summary <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>Erratic Silk Transactions: Yesterday's silk market was extremely chaotic, mainly due to the sharp contraction of exchange rates, prompting foreign firms to scramble for purchases. Most transactions were based on quotations from the previous day's telegrams, resulting in price discrepancies of three to four hundred yuan compared to the day's market prices. Consequently, silk merchants largely adopted a wait-and-see attitude in the afternoon, ceasing trading activities. Yesterday, Da Chang, Jardine Matheson, and Shin Shing and other firms collectively purchased four hundred bales. White filature and various reel silk grades were traded. All selling prices increased by fifty to two hundred yuan compared to the previous day's records. Although the prevailing sentiment is bullish, the silkworm cocoon harvesting season is approaching, and the rise in silk prices may cause more harm than good to future operations.</p>
<p>Slight Movement in Green Tea Exports: Yesterday, the price of green tea in various European estates was driven by the soaring gold prices and the sharp contraction of foreign exchange rates. Regarding Chunmee and Gunpowder tea, Jardine Matheson, Concordia, Tungkfook, Paochong and other firms purchased a total of over five hundred and ninety boxes of green tea. Selected Chunmee tea was sold at prices ranging from three hundred to three hundred and twenty-eight yuan, unselected Chunmee tea at one hundred and ninety to two hundred and forty yuan, and Gunpowder tea at two hundred and eighty to three hundred and ten yuan.</p>
<p>Soybeans Rise by Four to Five Yuan: Yesterday, the market for miscellaneous grains and soybeans was hit by turbulent waves, causing people to hesitate to sell their goods easily. The market was filled with buying interest but lacked sellers. Speculators were actively entering and exiting the market, creating unusual volatility. Consequently, the soybean market surged by four to five yuan (market price). The bean market rose sharply by one to two yuan.</p>
<p>Golden Needles and Hunan Lotus Seeds Both Rise: Among the northern goods, golden needles, tree ears, and Hunan lotus seeds have seen price increases of ten to twenty yuan due to demand from Hong Kong and their connection to foreign exchange. Tree ears were quoted at three hundred and twenty yuan. Locally grown lotus seeds, previously offered at one hundred and eighty-two yuan, were quoted at two hundred yuan yesterday. Top-grade vegetables, previously at fifty yuan, were quoted at four hundred and sixty yuan, with reported transactions at fifty-five yuan.</p>
<p>Seafood Held Back in Anticipation: Most seafood is imported and thus heavily influenced by foreign exchange rates. Therefore, major seafood dealers are adopting a wait-and-see approach and temporarily withholding sales. The expected price increase is approximately thirty percent.</p>
<p>Woolen Fabrics Continue to Arrive in Shanghai: Imported woolen fabrics from countries such as England, the United States, Japan, and Italy continue to arrive in Shanghai. Most are urgently needed fabrics such as feather yarn wool, heavy tweed, "baratheas", worsted coating, white serge, white drill, and "Wan Li Ding" fabrics. Customs clearance is extremely congested, as most of these goods were sold earlier and are now awaiting delivery upon arrival. Market price: Thursday, May 2, Year 29.</p>

<h3 id="e113">Cricket Tomb <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>A certain person was fond of cricket fighting. In the autumn of the previous year, he obtained a cricket that won repeatedly, earning him over a thousand gold coins. When the cricket died, he placed it in a silver coffin, engraved with a jade tablet, and inscribed it with "General Speedy and Agile". It was buried in the flower bed of the backyard, with a rounded tomb. Last autumn, after the White Dew season, his old addiction resurfaced. He sought crickets everywhere but found none to his liking. One evening, he was walking alone in the backyard when he suddenly heard a cricket chirping sound. Upon listening closely, he realized it was coming from the tomb. He dug up the tomb to find it, but saw nothing. Opening the silver coffin, he found that the cricket he had buried stiff and lifeless was now lively, flapping its wings, baring its fangs, and ready to fight. The man was overjoyed, thinking it was the reincarnation of the general. He took it out and fed it. When he tested it against the crickets he had, they were all easily defeated. He then took it out to gamble a little, and every bet was successful. From then on, he cherished it like a treasure, and would not bet a single fight unless for a large sum. The next day, a guest from Hangzhou visited him, bringing a basin and asking for a bet. The man saw that the guest's cricket was not very strong, so he increased the bet, agreeing to ten gold coins per "flower", with a hundred "flowers" determining the winner. The guest was not satisfied and proposed to add more. So, the two crickets were placed in the basin. As soon as they met, the man's cricket turned around and ran away. When forced to fight again, it jumped around endlessly, and then suddenly died. After the man paid off the bets he lost, he realized that he had used up all the winnings from the previous autumn, and it was still not even half of the debt. This year, after the spring sun greened the backyard, the man idly walked past the cricket tomb and angrily dug up and destroyed the tomb.</p>

<p>Even when subjected to great anger, he remained silent. The prophecy of Isaiah perfectly describes Jesus: "He was crucified with criminals, buried with the wicked, although he had committed no crime and no deceit was found in his mouth." The Roman judge, in Caesar's judgment hall, said to Jesus, "Don't you hear how many accusations they are bringing against you?" Jesus did not answer a word, which greatly astonished the judge. When Jesus remained silent, Pilate brought him to the front of the palace and said to the crowd, simply and truthfully, "Behold, the man!" Even when subjected to great anger and injustice, when all his instincts urged him to speak to avoid regret, he remained silent as usual. This requires true courage and true spirit. From this, we can see the greatness of Jesus. Jesus understood the value of silence and strictly controlled his ability to speak. Secondly, we see that Jesus spoke cautiously. When he spoke, he carefully chose his words, selecting those of value and speaking concisely, not wasting a single word. Every word has some meaning for life, and every character reveals his own personality. I remember when the United States held the dedication ceremony at the Gettysburg battlefield, the great American orator Hale spoke for over an hour, while Lincoln only spoke for seven minutes, yet his words have been translated into the languages of the world and passed down for millennia. From the four Gospels, we can see that Jesus's words can be read in thirty-five minutes, so short, yet the most quoted. Thus, the value of words lies not in quantity but in quality. Our fortune, misfortune, joy, and sorrow often come from the words we speak. The ability to speak is our greatest asset, but also our greatest danger. "Who is wise and understanding among you? Let them show it by their good life, by deeds done in the humility that comes from wisdom." For detailed study, please write to P.O. Box 1227.</p>
<h3 id="e115">Re-Emphasizing the "Safety Campaign" <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>– Lessons from the Past</p>
<p>In major cities, the number of innocent people who die under the wheels of vehicles each year is a terrible record. Last autumn, the authorities of the two concessions in Shanghai held a "Safety Campaign", which was a good idea. According to reports at the time, during the period of large-scale publicity and implementation involving filming movies, posting slogans, and students from various schools providing services on the roads, the number of vehicle accidents did decrease. However, although people feel fear towards the threat of death, they quickly forget the warning that "roads are like a tiger's mouth, do not walk in the middle". Drivers also fear legal trouble after causing accidents, but the "I am the only one who matters" mentality continues. Therefore, once the "publicity" period is over, everyone seems to "guarantee safety" and forget everything completely.</p>
<p>The so-called "Safety Campaign" naturally involves cooperation between pedestrians and drivers, but in many cases, there are situations that pedestrians cannot prevent. Let me give you the best example I have at hand, which is the injury to both feet of Yan Chuntang, the owner of Yihua.</p>
<p>The fault was naturally not with Mr. Yan, because no matter how crowded the passengers are, the driver cannot start the car immediately unless the doors are closed. If the ticket seller rings the bell early, then the ticket seller and the driver should jointly bear the responsibility, because they are the closest collaborators on the car.</p>
<p>Furthermore, due to the occurrence of this tragedy, there are a few points that must be said about the drivers and ticket sellers of Route 10 buses – in fact, they are also their faults, because even if they do not cause accidents, their dereliction of duty is a fact.</p>
<p>We know that Route 10 buses are the most crowded vehicles, and it is common for them not to stop due to the large number of passengers at the station (it is hoped that the company can add more vehicles). However, this has caused drivers to develop a habit of sometimes stepping on the accelerator and driving forward even when the car is not very crowded, leaving many passengers waiting at the station. Thus, after one, two, or even three cars have passed, the passengers at the station line up like they are buying cheap rice. In this way, when the fourth car comes, it is naturally impossible to accommodate so many passengers. The ticket seller ringing the bell early occurs at this time, and the tragic incident of the unfortunate passenger having their feet run over also occurs at this time.</p>
<p>This is just one example, and other trams or trolley buses also have this situation.</p>
<p>Let me say it again, the "Safety Campaign" is cooperation between pedestrians and drivers, but deliberately betting one's life and vehicle is ultimately a joke. Therefore, drivers paying attention to their duties is also the way to "safety".</p>
<p>The "Safety Campaign" is not a "fun fair", just as driving is not a simple mechanical task.</p>
<h3 id="e116">"Can't Live On" <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Can</p>
<p>Passing by Race Course Road, several rather large, thin chalk characters: "Can't Live On," burst into my sight. Followed by a mother with a drooping head, holding an infant less than a year old in her arms, and beside her, a boy and a girl, silently kneeling and begging for the sympathy of passersby.</p>
<p>"Can't Live On!" What a desperate, simple, and powerful cry, it strongly expresses the desire to survive; it is more direct and to the point than a long and verbose "complaint to the authorities."</p>
<p>A crowd was gathered around, gazing at them, and occasionally one or two passersby would squeeze in to take a look, but then go away looking blank. Are they so heartless? Seeing these people who seem to be straight out of a Masureller woodcut, they are unmoved and do not extend a hand of sympathy. But you are wrong to think so, these hurried and anxious strangers, perhaps they themselves should be classified as "Can't Live On"!</p>
<p>However, on this isolated island, there are also plenty of people living too well: high-rise buildings, beautiful wives and concubines, luxurious clothing and fine food, responding to every beck and call. The urgent, simple, and powerful cry of "Can't Live On," they cannot see it, and will never hear it, because they live in another world.</p>
<p>But please, take out your compassion, you must know that the group of "Can't Live On" are also our descendants of Yan and Huang. According to the meaning of "sharing the same boat in the storm," the valuable things we rescue them from the line of starvation, only require you to moderate your extravagant lifestyles a little, with a small effort, you will help others considerably.</p>
<p>We should enable people who "Can't Live On" to all live on!</p>

<p>— Xin Yin</p>
<p>A little after four o'clock, the tram was so crowded that it was almost impossible to breathe.</p>
<p>At Rue Cardinal Mercier, many passengers got off, and there was much more space on the platform. After the tram started moving, the driver said first:</p>
<p>"Those two 'Chi Laos' have gone. I wonder if the old man had anything stolen?"</p>
<p>"I don't know, I suppose they wouldn't go empty-handed." The ticket seller replied.</p>
<p>A passenger asked, seemingly not understanding:</p>
<p>"What are 'Chi Laos'?"</p>
<p>"Pickpockets!"</p>
<p>"Those two?" The passenger continued to ask.</p>
<p>I did not hear the ticket seller's reply, but wondered in my heart:</p>
<p>"Since you knew, why didn't you catch them?"</p>
<p>Avenue Mesny arrived, and the passengers got off one after another, and I followed and got off the tram too.</p>

<p>Chapter 23: Old Friends and New Acquaintances, Writing Has Value; Famous Scenic Spots, Well-Managed People</p>
<p>Jin Danyun had already secretly informed Zhu Airen to set her mind at ease. Moreover, the Suliya couple wanted to visit their hospital and infant asylum in a few days. Therefore, Zhu Airen thought: instead of visiting the hospital and infant asylum in a few days, why not visit them now? So she said, "Then after we send Sister Junsu to school today, why not go to our Anle Town to see our country hospital and country infant asylum? If you don't mind the humble accommodations, would you like to have a simple meal with us there?" Jin Danyun said, "No! Our itinerary has already been arranged. After we send Sister Junsu back to school, we will go to Yuantouzhu in Wuxi for lunch. This was arranged in advance, and we are guests of Mr. Xue, an engineer and old classmate of Jiancheng and his wife. This Mr. Xue is the deputy manager and chief engineer of the Taihu Cement Company. In the evening, we will rush to Huzhou and stay at the Huanhu Third Hotel, and someone will also treat us to dinner, namely Jiancheng's elder sister and brother-in-law. They live in Huzhou, which was also arranged in advance. Tomorrow morning, we will return to Jiaxing, and someone has also arranged lunch. After returning to Suzhou from Jiaxing, we might be able to visit Anle Town, and then return to Shanghai." "Zhu Ai" said, "That's fine then! Let's decide on visiting Anle Town tomorrow afternoon. I'll take this ride to return to the hospital. It's just that we're troubling you along the way, which makes us very uneasy. What should we do?" Jin Danyun said, "We're like sisters, why speak so politely?" At that time, the two Miss He originally wanted to invite Lin Jiancheng, Engineer Lin, to see the site of their factory in Freedom Village, which they planned to build. It was just that they were on their honeymoon vacation, so it was difficult to mention it. Today, knowing that they were going to Anle Town tomorrow afternoon, and that Anle Town was not far from Freedom Village, they could take this opportunity to invite the couple to see the factory site in Freedom Village, so that they could have a rough idea of it. At that time, the two Miss He took the opportunity to tell Jin Danyun, and Jin Danyun immediately agreed, saying, "Definitely, and we also want to visit Village Chief Zhu, Mr. Zhu, in Freedom Village. He was still a comrade of my late father, and also the most respected elder by my late father." The two Miss He happened to have this opportunity, and naturally they were overjoyed. As they were talking, the car gradually approached Suzhou, which was a bustling town, and the Bao'en Temple Pagoda in Suzhou was already towering in sight. Mrs. Suliya said, "What is this place?" Wu Junsu said, "This is called Waikuatang, a town in the northeast of Suzhou." So she asked Jin Danyun, "I'll get on the bus here, so I can get to my school."</p>

<h3 id="e120">A Few Suggestions Regarding Domestic Films <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>— Qiu Xi</p>
<p>In recent years, the production of "historical costume dramas" can truly be described as surging like a storm. Great Wall is invincible, but observing their content, nineteen out of ten take the romantic affairs of "talented scholars and beautiful ladies" as their subject matter. This kind of "historical costume drama" can only suit the tastes of a certain group of people. In the eyes of young children, it does not evoke any interest. Therefore, I hope that the authorities of various domestic film companies, when choosing materials in the future, will carefully consider adopting more good materials related to national child heroes in history, which I believe is also urgently needed by young children!</p>
<p>Living on today's isolated island, the difficulties encountered by young people, and the temptations of evil forces, are all enough to make them numb, sink, and degenerate, because they are far away from the embrace of the motherland. Here, we can use subtle methods to shoot some conscious films to inspire their will, point out their paths, and let them know how they should fight against the strong enemy at hand!</p>
<p>As for the historical data of national child heroes, there are many, such as Zai Qi of the State of Lu in the Spring and Autumn Period, who, in order to defend his motherland and save the country from danger, took up arms and bravely killed the enemy, and the heroic deeds of dying on the battlefield. Shi Tongzi of Jiading in the Ming Dynasty, who made sacrifices to resist the enemy, and Xia Cungu of Songjiang in the late Ming Dynasty—this journal previously published Mr. Haixing's "Child Hero Xia Cungu," saying that Wei Ruohui is now engaged in adapting it into a children's historical drama—when the Qing soldiers went south, he resolutely joined the army to plot the restoration of the country. The stories that can be sung and wept over are all good subjects for realistic shooting.</p>
<p>In addition, there are also the struggle histories of famous people in history during their childhood, which are all worthy of emulation and practice by modern young children.</p>
<h3 id="e121">Review of the Wing On Amusement Society's Charity Performance of "Pan Jinlian" <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>— Wu</p>
<p>The Wing On Amusement Society, organized by colleagues from the Wing On Company, was invited by the Shanghai Relief Committee for Zhongshan Refugees to perform a charity performance at the Lyceum Theatre for eight consecutive evenings. The reporter drove to watch on the evening of the 30th. The performance that evening was the society's newly adapted and improved "Pan Jinlian."</p>
<p>The play lasted four hours. The plot was intense, and the atmosphere was tense all the time. The plot depicts Pan Jinlian as a victim of forced marriage under the feudal system. It was adapted by Mai Youyun, and is sad and beautiful, with profound plots and demanding singing and acting. The playwright's mastery of Chinese classics is profound, and the lyrics are ornate and beautiful, thorough and exquisite. The dialogue in the play is witty and ambiguous, with endless aftertastes. The wording is subtle, and is appreciated by both the refined and the common. Only a master can achieve this.</p>
<p>The protagonist Guo Linshuang's Wu Song is heroic and majestic in appearance, agile and steady in his movements, and has a clear voice. The two scenes of killing his sister-in-law and offering sacrifices to her spirit are passionate, tragic, and touching. His recitations and singing have a magnetic sound, and are mournful and powerful. Zhong Fenghua's Pan Jinlian is also very exquisite in her performance, from the initial gentleness to the subsequent coquetry when teasing her uncle; when rejected, she is both hateful and surprised, and the twists and turns of her emotions are fully conveyed. Her voice is as thin as a gossamer thread, and stops the clouds in their tracks. Mr. Mai plays Ximen Qing, and his free and unrestrained manner gives people a deep impression, and his pronunciation is clear throughout the performance. Liang Yimin portrays Wu Dalang vividly, bringing out his personality perfectly; the scene of saying goodbye to his brother is deeply emotional and sincere. Tang Guanpeng's Uncle Jiu is full of energy, has a mellow singing voice, and is serious in his movements, but is slightly overdone. The other supporting actors are well-matched and complement each other perfectly.</p>
<p>As for all the sets, costumes, props, and lighting, they are luxurious and novel. Reading the society's special publication, I know that "Xi Shi" and "The Peach Blossom Fan" have more nationalistic ideas. I believe that the ticket prices for this charity performance, five yuan, ten yuan, and twenty yuan, are quite expensive, but this is inevitable because it is a charitable event. If the ticket prices could be lowered slightly for general public performances, wouldn't the benefits to the world and people's hearts be great?</p>

<p>The children of stars, although they have no direct relationship with the silver screen, after ten or twenty years, they will surely be the substitutes for the current popular stars!</p>
<p>Maureen O'Sullivan and her late husband had a son and a daughter, both of whom are very beautiful. The son is about the same age as Baby LeRoy, and the daughter is five years old this year, and her name is Kathleen.</p>
<p>Dick Powell has three sons: one is from Joan Blondell's previous husband, and the other two are his official sons. The older one is only two years old, and the younger one is only one year old.</p>
<p>Myrna Loy's son is already twenty-five years old, and is three inches taller than her when he stands up.</p>
<p>Although Loretta Young is not yet married, she has already adopted a son. He is three years old this year and is named Judy.</p>
<p>Dan Dailey already has three sons, one named Donny, one named Ronny, and one named Tommy. Now he only hopes to have a beautiful daughter.</p>
<p>Robert Taylor has a godson named Dean, who was adopted by Barbara Stanwyck.</p>
<p>Joan Bennett gave birth to a daughter when she was seventeen, and gave birth to another daughter after marrying Gene Markey.</p>
<p>Annabelle and her ex-husband have a five-year-old daughter. Recently, because Tyrone Power wanted to experience being a father, he specially asked his French ex-husband to give her back.</p>

<p>Drama Society Performs Famous Play "Wu Zetian"</p>
<p>When the Shanghai Drama Society was performing at the Lyceum Theatre, there was already news of an international charity performance, but it later subsided. Now, this charity performance has become more concrete. It can be said that the drama circle is having a relationship with the international community for the first time, because it is hosted by the British and French ambassadors and performed by the Shanghai Drama Society. The Drama Society had carefully considered the repertoire for this grand performance. At that time, it was planned to perform a play translated from British and French works. However, thinking that using the Chinese stage techniques, which have not yet reached the pinnacle of perfection, to perform foreign plays, foreign audiences may not be satisfied. So it was decided to perform a play with strong Chinese flavor.</p>
<p>"Wu Zetian" was decided under such circumstances. Wu Zetian is the only female emperor in Chinese history, and many foreigners know about her experiences. This can not only arouse the interest of foreigners, but also allow foreigners to have a real understanding of her. The date of the performance has been decided to be held on the evening of May 22nd, and the ticket prices are divided into two types: five yuan and ten yuan. The Drama Society attaches great importance to this performance, and the selection of actors is especially meticulous (Xia Xia will still play the role of Wu Zetian), and it is scheduled to be previewed once on May 3rd. The ticket prices for this preview will be the same as usual.</p>

<p>Zhao Ruquan, the pillar of the Gong Wu Stage, met with the important performers and chief screenwriter Chuan Xiaobo the night before yesterday to discuss six new plays about the Living Buddha Jigong. It is said that the stage's leading actress has secretly persuaded Dan Bai Sulian to join.</p>
<p>He Yuru, the up-and-coming actor of the Geng Xin troupe, has submitted his resignation to the authorities and returned the advanced engagement fee of 140 yuan. However, manager Yun Jiqian cannot make a decision on the departure of the performers because Dong Zhaobin is still in Beiping and needs to wait for Mr. Dong to return to resolve the matter. He Yuru's request has not been accepted.</p>
<p>Dan Yu Sulian went to Ningbo to negotiate the troupe's performance. She will return to Shanghai today, but there is news that Ningbo has suspended entertainment, so whether she and they can go to perform is a question that will have to wait for Sulian to return to decide.</p>
<p>Wusheng Li Shunlai left the Da Wu Stage the day before yesterday. He is preparing to cooperate with Yu Sulian and go to Ningbo.</p>
<p>The five episodes of The Vegetarian General by the Carlton Theatre have already distributed the scripts to the actors the day before yesterday and rehearsed the play once. Rehearsals began last night.</p>

<p>— Dani</p>
<p>On March 31, 1930, the American Film Censorship Board convened all filmmakers to jointly formulate and abide by the following articles. Among them, the "Special Regulations" have excessively detailed outlines, and due to space limitations, it is not convenient to copy them verbatim. Here, the three articles of the main text are excerpted and translated here for the reference of filmmakers in our country. Especially in today's isolated island, the film industry has developed abnormally. Works that inspire justice and promote popular morale are already common, but there are also many that are vulgar and boring. I hope that all filmmakers will correct their mistakes if they have them, and encourage themselves if they do not, which is the motivation for the author to excerpt and translate this article.</p>
<p>Main Text</p>
<p>(1) Productions that are lower than the moral standards of the audience are strictly prohibited. In other words, films that are sufficient to promote the audience's tendency to commit crimes and bad behaviors should be made to disappear.</p>
<p>(2) If it is necessary to change the existing social life system or state due to the needs of the plot, this layer can be accommodated and handled.</p>
<p>(3) Productions that produce ridicule of the law, or indirectly encourage blasphemy of the law are not allowed.</p>
<h3 id="e126">A Record of the Chess Tournament for the Soldiers in Chongqing <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>— Xinsheng</p>
<p>(Chongqing Correspondence) Our country's chess master, Mr. Xie Xiaxun, arrived in Chongqing last month from Kunming. He recently participated in a chess tournament for the soldiers. Here is a brief description:</p>
<p>The preliminary round opened at 7:00 p.m. on April 7th in the hall of the Sino-French-Swiss-Belgian Alumni Association. President Shao Lizi delivered a speech, and Mr. Xie reported on his travels in the south, generally saying: This time he went abroad through the Philippines, Java, Malaysia, and Burma, and all the monthly donations promoted and founded amounted to about 20 million yuan in national currency, and the income from chess tickets was more than 50,000 yuan in national currency, all of which were used to help refugees and plead for the lives of tens of millions of victims in the motherland. Then the chess competition began. At the beginning of the preliminary round, both sides fought fiercely. Then, Mr. Xie personally played blind chess against Chen Xunqu, the top player in the Ministry of Finance. The moves were brilliant, and the audience applauded. As a result, Master Xie won a game, and the preliminary round temporarily came to an end.</p>
<p>The official chess competition opened on the evening of April 11th. The venue was the Social Hall, which was still divided into two major chessboards: Chinese chess and international chess. The Chinese chessboard was arranged side by side on the left and right. Souvenirs from Mr. Xie's trip to the south were hung on the scene, colorful and interesting.
