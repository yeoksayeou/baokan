<p>四日之前，蘇聯鄭重保證援華政策決不變更；關於這一點，我們旣深忻慰於本報近頃屢次檢討蘇聯態度時，幸而觀察與論斷的不謬；同時，尤得確認蘇聯對國際的種種難於捉摸之中。却首先得此明朗的一環，予國際以共見共聞。日本新任駐蘇大使的走馬上任，日方謂畀之全權，進行一切談判；日前日首相近衛發表談話，謂蘇日談判在進行一切談判；日前日首相近衛發表談話，謂蘇日談判在進行中；昨日東京所傳柏林消息，謂德國已派遣使命團往莫斯科，促進蘇日兩國重行接近。凡此有關蘇日兩國之，所有各種動作的中心目標，假定還如日本所屢次表示的，希望由努力調整蘇日關係，俾得完成其所謂中國事變的解決；則已由蘇聯決不變更援華政策的保證而迎面打擊了上述各種動作的意義，使之事前獲得了失敗的答案。</p>
<p>蘇聯立國於國際，必然有其根本大計；至於政策的運用，當然不拘一格，却又不離其本。因此，英美與德日兩方面競向莫斯科追求的成敗，至多在蘇聯政策之一時的與局部的角度之內，容或因此而有伸縮；超此角度，終是　旁；遠試證之蘇德締交，蘇聯決不袒德而對英作戰；近試證之全局混沌，蘇聯決不猶豫其援華辦法；這是顯見的範疇。但其間如何伸縮運用，則必與國際其他情況相配合而呼應；故數年來絕不誇耀的援華於沉默之中，這一次却在英國放棄其遠東妥協政策而重行開放滇緬運輸的同時，以重言聲明其不變更援華政策者，鼓勵了英國的決心，而表示其間的相與適應。我們不必過分奢稱，如此兩相適應的含有如何如何重大意義；然在旬日之前，似乎舉世翹企著蘇聯如何率先為英美張目；而當時我們的觀察，以為「蘇聯對的態度為鮮明，英美對此正不必有何新期待；相反的，蘇聯在遠東是否肯更一步而有更好的作為。大約在英美毅然有所作為之後」；要蘇聯「發動」一切，「先視英美」。從這一種觀察所發見的，以與這一次蘇聯所聲明保證，試加揣摩，當不能否認其間蓋有微妙的氣息吧！循此推求，蘇聯雖對於遠東變局把握住了比重很高的決定因素，而為舉世視綫所集，亦即眾望所繫；然大眾所應注目的動力支點，還不在彼，而在南亞演變中的英美。英美兩國，尤其美國，最近對遠東的有作有為，有聲有色，大約也已覷破個中關鍵了。</p>
<p>當然，英美現在的奮然蹶起，分担遠東重任，這與慕尼黑時代的疎忽了藐視了蘇聯，絕不相侔；但看美國最近在外交上以及物資供給上，對蘇聯如何融和貫通，非惟可作不疎忽不藐視蘇聯的反證，且可視為美國對蘇聯盡其在已的眞誠實跡。論者或以為英美意態如此，未可遽許為英美納結蘇聯的把握所在；況蘇聯夙被各方稱為不可捉摸之謎，其舉動安知不出乎英美意外，使英美收穫相反的後果？對此假設的岐途，誰都不能作何必中的預言。且預言不負兌現責任，雖預言，亦無益。然而新近非無新理由，得為英美方面增加幾分希望。是在蘇聯與德義日之，根性上，本質上，悠久的利害上，具有深刻至無可弭縫的間隙，無可消釋的矛盾，有與其根本大計相刺謬之外，別有使蘇聯在一時的與局部的政策上，亦應心懷戒懼，望德義日而却步之處。近有不具名之讀者某君，投書本報，述其對於三國盟約的另一觀察；他說三國盟約顯明的對著美國，又顯明的除開蘇聯，但是別忘了希特勒先生歷來所用出其不意，聲東擊西的攻略原則；彼屢次運用神經戰術，分散了對方注意力之後，却再突然用閃電戰術，收效奏功；故盟約中何在顯明的除開蘇聯，應查考其一貫的攻略原則而尋覓其眞意。他又說：德國並不要什麼英倫三島，然則何為而必冒未可逆的危險，付不可計數的代價，繼續進攻三島？他克服了法國後，西綫已經相當穩固，又何為而必以盟約，明拒美國於千里之外？永久的軍略，為立國的資源，所亟在巴爾幹與烏克蘭一帶，因此而與英法蘇聯三國自始柄鑿不相容；現在法國已收在掌握之中，又因據有法國而對英扼守有餘，三去其二，祇有一蘇·盟約却明除了些「蘇」；盟約纔宣布，跟著即向巴爾幹進展而遣軍入羅馬尼亞了，難道這是對付英國而不是對付蘇聯？此君入羅巴尼亞了，難道這是對付英國而不是對付蘇聯？此君所論，我們最同意於其關於德國進兵羅馬尼亞的這一點。我們不以為德兵入羅，並非對英作戰中的別一面，却以為因此而同時強調了蘇德間原有的矛盾；雖在希特勒先生主觀上不以此舉來威脅蘇聯，但在事實上殆將使蘇聯對德，以此舉而更懷戒懼，望而却步；於此而蔚為蘇聯更不利於英國一敗墮地的新理由，亦即為英美謀所以博得蘇聯同情者，乃得增加幾分新理由，昨傳德　派遣使命團赴莫斯科，大約其使命為日本打算未必多，而為進兵羅馬作解釋，求諒解，甚或是許願，是其主要使命吧！國際許願，輒有奇效；但利盡交疎，圖窮七見，在混噸角逐之中，則雙往往而然。</p>

<p>兩情繾綣，如膠如漆，這是恩愛夫婦應有的現象。誠然，一個情強力足的健壯男子，一旦和風姿綽的憧憬春情的女郎結婚，他們必然情深如海，樂勝于飛，生育着伶俐的子女，組織快樂的家庭，這是何等的幸福！本來夫婦是男女愛情的結合體，應該心心相印，脈脈相連，同歡共苦，無分你我。如果夫婦而不相恩愛，則將與何人恩愛？然而事實每不然，世間相愛的夫婦果然有，但恨若寃家的怨耦，也眞不少。在社會新聞中，關於自殺謀殺，私奔私通，別居離婚的悲舉，不是時有所聞嗎？</p>
<p>愛人何以變爲仇人？夫妻何以變爲寃家？其間雜有原因多端，錯綜複雜，莫衷一是。但性能衰退，致愛情動搖，常爲最多的原因。我們褐開天窗說亮話，夫婦是性關係的結合，他們的性生活如果美滿，那愛情必然濃厚，如果男子於早年犯有自凟與遺精，或婚後的荒淫縱慾，與憂勞斵塲之故，斵傷了性機能，爆發着滑精漏精，早洩陽萎，性器發育不全，短小如指，神經衰弱，精薄不育等症，那在夫婦的性生活上即無法圓滿。我人試設身處地以思，當正在美目凝盼渴求歡慰的居下位者，如果她的對方毫不中用，或竟望風披靡，已萬事皆休，這是何等痛心疾首的事！若一而再，再而三，使她的靑春蹉跎，這怎能不使她惱恨？是以愛情破裂，夫婦閒就發生着種種的悲劇！</p>
<p>聰明丈夫，唯一補救辦法，卽在根本治愈其疾病。治療之法，據世界名醫及余經騐：均以服生殖腺素製劑「生殖素」，最爲對症而特效。因此劑係由雄壯動物如猩猩，海狗等體中提取的生殖腺素用科學方法複製而成。所以品質純粹，藥性王道，服後於一日夜間卽能生精補腎，健腦活血，滋養神經，發揮偉大的效力。若能繼續服用，必可於短期內將上述各症完全治愈，幷可收益壽延年返老還童之效。惟有遺精者，須兼服「希米脫氏固精片，」以固精關，制止遺洩，則標本兼治，收效允速。</p>

<p>據衛生家說：『人生本來該派他享壽七十或八十歲的，但他不愼致患疾病而縮短了天年，這是他的罪惡！』那末，靑年人如果犯有自凟與遺精，這是多麼的罪惡呢？我人體內的精液是在各種內分泌腺中最寶貴的。功能調整新陳代謝作用，助長發育機能，滋養各部神經。若因自凟與遺精使體內的精液流失過多，則新陳代謝作用减退，在各部組織中新細胞產生缺乏，而老細胞的死亡過多，遂致面黃肌瘦，年齡雖輕，已現衰老，更因腦，脊髓，性三大神經的衰弱，凡腦衰健忘，失眠多夢，腰痠背痛，腎虧無能，精力渙散等症更相繼而來，不特此也，遺精不治，勢必致精枯血竭，發育機能受其阻止，常呈身材低矮，性器短小，一如童稚。誠如這樣的靑年，奄奄一息，不特爲學不能專心，職業不能勝任，半生潦倒，一事無成。就是在人生所不可少的夫婦生活上，亦必不能圓滿，爲妻痛恨，家庭更陷於悲慘地獄，以病弱之軀，而復遭遇種種刺激，以致憂傷自殺或一病嗚呼者，亦是甚多的事！</p>
<p>欲謀補救，自凟必須戒絕，遺精允須及早治療，則服『希米脫氏固精片」，卽可鞏固精關，鎭靜神經，遺精自愈。如因遺精已引起上述症象者，須兼服生殖腺素製劑「生殖素」以培補腦腎，增益精血，滋養神經，促進發育機能，旺盛新陳代謝作用，若繼續服用，必可於短期內將上述各症完全治愈，幷可收延年益壽返老還童之效。惟患者如在本埠能親來本診所就專家治療，更可保證治愈。</p>

<h3 id="c52">發育乳峯的最新方法 <a href="#c52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>— 美國醫學博士姚崇培</p>
<p>我們如果要澈底了解女性健美的價値，那無疑祇耍先去估計其乳峰的發育水準，最爲扼要，蓋女性的乳峰。如果能够愈高而愈有彈性，則不僅在美觀上，可以和婀娜的腰身，丯腴的臀部，搆成最神秘的曲線，使入陶醉愛慕之外，同時她們的卵巢機能必健全。新陳代謝作用必旺盛，所以性情無不溫良柔順，肌肉無不晶瑩潔白，面色更無不紅順而嫵媚，她們不但到處香噴噴爲人艷羨，佔着許多便宜，就是於閨房之內的私生活上，亦無不使丈夫心滿意足，幸福無窮！</p>
<p>可是話得說回來。此種幸福，如果去因束胸，自凟，或患有月經不調。白帶，貧血等症，以致卵巢機能迺受摧殘，影響新陳代謝作用，而致乳峰萎瘍，健美喪失者，幸福之神便不會和她親近，她所遭遇者，不過惡劣的環境，和悲慘的命運而已。唯一補救辦法，祗有積極服以卵巢製劑女用「生殖素」，最爲對症而特效，蓋此劑係由奧國生理學大師斯丹那博士，積三十餘年之艱辛實騐發明，復經中西許多著名醫師化騐證明，認爲藥性和平，功效偉大，無論各種婦女隱病，均能在最短期內統治全愈，如果繼續服用，持之以恒，那不個可使萎瘍的乳峰屹然高聳，同時還能使腎部丯腴，肌肉滑潤，面頰嬌艷靑春長駐。</p>

<h3 id="c54">德軍佔領下的巴黎 <a href="#c54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>向稱繁華甲天下的巴黎，自被德軍佔領以來，昔日熱鬧光景，早歸烏有之鄉。市間情形凄凉，居民失業者比比皆是。在饑餓綫上的男男女女，允其是家主婦，和身上仍舊穿着軍服的復員軍人，每天站在伙食鋪與肉店外面的，排列成一長錢，等待購買食物，食物缺乏的嚴重情况亦可想見。茲將紐的泰晤士報所紀的巴黎近况，譯述於左：</p>
<p>法政府副總理賴伐爾會於八月二十六日從維希秘密到巴黎，在麥蒂農旅館，設宴招待德國高級軍官，磋商法政府遷回巴黎問題。德方對此，雖表示願意從長計議，但亦謂事實上却有個重大困難。原來貝當政府如果遷回巴黎，各機關大小職員隨之而來的，人數將在二萬五千人左右，在這人浮於事的巴黎，無論如何，難將這一大批的人安挿下來。</p>
<p>法國復員的軍人，和受戰事影響而失業的人，近來已陸續返回巴黎尋求工作。巴黎區內三百萬法國人中，失業的不下六十萬人。本來在巴黎郊外各工廠中工作的，有百分之七十五爲軍火製造工人，因爲軍火廠閉門，這班工人也就全吿失業。賴伐爾的微服返巴黎，在與德方磋商貝當政府還都之外，還會設法同德軍當局解決這嚴重的失業問題。</p>
<p>紐約泰晤士報記者於八月下旬從維希赴巴黎，覺得由維希赴巴黎困難孔多，曾等待了一星期之久，纔獲得維希政府的通行證。巴黎的情形迴非昔比，栗伏里路穆里期旅館門首貼着一張吿示，上面有「巴黎城駐軍司令部」字樣。德方不叫巴黎爲都會，而貶稱之爲城，倒是觸目得很。</p>
<p>在郊外一路向市區進發，十三世紀時代的沙托克斯堡上卐字旗臨風飄揚，表示德軍司令部駐紥於內。沿路看見德兵來往，有的步行，有的騎着機器脚踏車，還有坐着汽車和運輸車。兩旁壕溝內，已遭破損的各種車輛數在一千以上，都是軍民由巴黎出亡時所遺棄的。由芳丹卜蘿至巴黎的一段路中，向來車馬不絕於途，現在暮色蒼茫之下，路上已闃寂不見一車。趕着大道前進，直奔義大利門。在多霧的夏夜驅車入巴黎，但見一片荒凉景象，和拖泥帶水的感覺。路上旣無車輛，絕駛三四分鐘辰光，巳行盡了臘斯俾蔭路。除了幾座大厦門房外見有少數人之外，一切闐無生氣。蒙脫派納士蔭路口的一家咖啡館還開着，台階上坐着客人。那些藝術家，和後補藝術家仍未曾忘情於這個可愛的所在。</p>
<p>經聖日耳曼蔭路穿過協和廣塲，而至香藹禮大街，幾分鐘內又穿過了巴黎市中心區。夜之慕漸漸下垂，看看街景，知道不久就要昏黑了。香藹禮大街旁兩三家漂亮咖啡館仍舊開着。但是福貴德咖啡館，有時候稱爲巴黎美國俱樂部的，業巳大門緊閉。平時車水馬龍，交通中心的廣塲上，冷淸消得不見一人。凱旋門下歐戰陣亡將士墓旁的長明燈，還是燃點着。</p>
<p>福煦路那里的高堂大厦與富麗的公寓，從七月以來空閉着的，此時却出於意料的熱鬧起來。德軍已微用了這些華麗的大厦，他們的軍用車時時戰着軍官們來往饕嚼。</p>
<p>清晨，波洛臯公園之旁，德軍整隊行進，他們一陣步伐之聲，把園內小鳥的囀鳴聲打斷了。角子上站着一隊身穿綠制服的靑年德兵，引吭高唱軍歌。進行曲和他們的步伐打成一片和諧的音調。這種軍歌，在德軍佔領區內，幾乎沒有一隊德兵不唱的。所以聽了這種進行曲，便恍惚迷離起來，不知自己究竟在波洛臯公園旁呢，還是在柏林的公園旁？</p>
<p>往紐易橋的地下火車站，最近的路，必須穿過公園中一英里長的駛馬道，在那路上碰到一羣騎着馬德德國軍官。這種景象又叫人想起上屆大戰後在柏林公園中所見的一切。那時候在公園中騎着馬德軍官，在這半共產化的柏林城中，連他們自己都一些提不起興緻來。他們都穿着蔽舊的軍裝在溜馬。現在這班在巴黎的德國軍官，情狀大異，都穿着簇新的制服了。</p>
<p>走了這一英里長的寂寞之路，纔達到地下火車站。巴黎除了地下火車的交通未斷外，已沒有公共汽車，沒有出租汽車，私人汽車也被公家徵發一空。眼前所看見的一切景象，與往昔大不相同。早晨醒來時，從前巴黎所具的各種愉快氣氛，早已一掃而光。不錯，這地方還是巴黎，房屋街道和有些人都還是巴黎色彩。但是巴黎的優美柔和之處，已無可尋求了。（未完）</p>

<p>— 聖凱瓊</p>
<p>—十月十二日—</p>
<p>目前日本雖然色歷而內荏，但在控制越南的今日，它的侵略野心仍時時刻刻想利用機會以實現。前日本聯合艦隊高橋海軍大將稱，日本不能怕懼美國的干涉而停止南進，而今日實爲日本向南進展的最後機會；日本爲解決「中國事件」必須將越南。荷印置於日本勢力範圍之下；美國的經濟封鎖，日本固將遭受不利，但未始不可以荷印·越南的油·鐵·橡皮而予補救。故日本表面上的溫和·鎭靜·忍耐，正是內心上的憤怒·急燥·計謀的掩飾，老實說日本繼控制越南之後，遲早要奪取荷印，則遲早必須與美國衝突，而日美的戰爭遲早要在太平洋上發生，日本一旦能奪得荷印，它卽不怕英美的經濟戰爭，因爲不能向英美所取給的，可由越南與荷印來補償，以越南言，每年產米七百萬噸，除米以外，棉花。玉蜀黍·胡麻·大豆·落花生·甘蔗各種產物極爲豐富，卽橡皮出產，一年亦達六萬噸。至於地下資源，年產煤二百四十萬噸，內中百分之六十是鴻基的無烟煤。鑛沙三四萬噸，含鐵的一萬六千餘噸，產錳的二千五百餘噸，產錫一千六百餘噸。而日本對於越南一向是入超。以荷印言，對於日本更較越南重要，荷印的豐富資源中間：年產糖的一百四十萬噸，橡皮的十八萬噸，金鷄納霜一萬餘噸，錫七千四百萬噸，這些都佔全世界產額自百分之三十至九十不等，他如煤油年產的八百萬噸。所以無論在軍事上的價値，在經濟上的價値，實在是取償資源及開拓市塲最好的地域。事實上日本無論如何不肯放棄荷印，則日本一旦巧取豪奪了荷印，美國爲維持太平洋上的安全與美國的經濟利益，勢必出之於戰爭之途。此項可能性決不是在很長很久的將來，而是在極短近的將來。到那時候，遠東戰爭擴大，僅有法幣可以使用，法幣滙價無疑的會自然放長。</p>
<p>於此筆者極誠勸吿在外滙市塲的投機者，快不要再將有用的資金在投機，筆者敢斷言今後外滙的投機無利可圖，而因局勢的變幻，遲早必得受虧損的結果，目前銀行的减息無形中已說明此種動向。爲加强你資金的安全，增殖你資金的累積，祇有加强抗戰建國的力量——努力將資金認儲節的建國儲蓄，不但本金安全可靠，還有優厚的利息。較之在外匯上投機，其所得利益，因勞逸不同，遠不能比擬，何况目今投機又失敗的成份居多呢，投機的人們，快將從謀取投機利益的心思轉向謀取正當的投資利益，而努力認儲節約建國儲蓄吧！（完）</p>

<p>烚赤漲七十八元</p>
<p>晨初人心帶軟、開市卽小二十元、　兌業出銀號二十兩、爲五千五百五十元、繼賴金號搜買、曾引至五百六十五元、旋乃錢兌業銀號力賣、立又退至五百三十五元、後以證券幫及金號扒進、復回至五十元、奈錢兌業銀號再來叶賣、加之斯時金號亦來求售、遂跌達五千五百二十元低價、串其時限價買戶紛來、跌勢遂阻、不久再賴某某二錢兌業互相競扒補空、且現金號納胃亦佳、故收市遂回至五千五百六十元、午後開市抬升二十元、銀號進金號三十兩、爲五千五百八十元、嗣因某錢兌業拋出、曾小至六十五元、旋散戶頗有吃胃、頻來撈入、勢又向上、迨至五千五百九十元時、某證券幫忽來在扒、立衝出五千六百元大關、後某證劵幫繼續猛撈不息、加之銀號幫及錢兌業等空頭爭先抵補、且斯時滙市報軟、兼傳某種利多消息、雖某錢兌業仍不時塞出、但頭寸仍感不敷、不久竟漲至五千六百九十元、入後買戶减少、證券幫散多獲利回吐、收盤前回低至五千六百五十元、收盤卒爲五千六百五十八元、結果比上週末軋漲七十八元、全天一　百七十元上落、現金號之本脾金售出價、照烚赤高十數元、收進减低三十餘元、現標金照掛牌金低五十餘元、均鮮做開、</p>
<p>飾金亦掛大十元</p>
<p>銀樓飾金、每兩兌出、初時未動、迨至午後二時四十分、掛大十元、計大同行改縣五白八十元、新同行與上價相同、收進减低三十元光景、</p>

<p>外滙昨日市况、匯豐掛牌揭曉、英美各長一二五、計爲三辦士六八七五及五兀六二五、其他各匯亦一致放長、英美滙暗市、先鬆後緊、走勢盤旋、後市因有國外利多空氣、投機商如廣帮等買意陡濃、扒入若干、市象一度緊至三辦士七八一二五及五元七五、惟結果英金仍吿三辦士七八一二五、美滙則爲五元七八一二五、比上週末軋緊〇三一二五及〇六二五、</p>
<p>晨初以海外匯兌、英對美對滬均平、美對外匯兌則吿休業、中央掛牌各匯如舊、銀行晨開現貨賣價、英金三辦士八二八一二五、美匯五元八一一五、較之上週六、英平美緊〇三一一五、開後華行首塞、且外行有利等對開盤價、頗肯供給、市面遂吿鬆平、計華行售予某美行十月份美匯五元八七五、滙豐掛牌揭曉、英美各長一二五、白銀平衡稅揭曉則無變動、此後市况殊靜、走勢呆平、投機商吃進十月與十一月份美匯五元八四三七五及八七五、後洋行吸納有利現貨美匯五元八四三七五、嗣後交易更少、迄至午收、英金鬆爲三辦士八二八一二五、美滙吿五元八四三七五、</p>
<p>後市初况尙尙平、迨二時十分、投機家想結、本月份美滙五元八四三七五、但未曾得手不久因有某種空氣、廣帮首來扒結、其他投機商亦接蹤活動、市向驟形軟化、計做開本月份美匯五元八一二五及七八一二五、三時半現貨亦緊至三辦士七八一二五及五元七五、收盤前扒風始息、遂稍回平、迄晚收英金三辦士七八一二五、美匯五元七八一二五、十一月英金三辦士七六五六二五、美匯五元七五、結果比上週末、現期英均緊〇三一二五、美各軟〇六二五、</p>

<p>衆業公所昨日股市開盤、趨勢略現動盪、初因拋空者衆多、市况被壓下游、嗣因會德豐股不斷有人購進、其餘價格、俱被帶高、上午收盤潛勢堅挺、下午獲利了結之風雖盛、但大衆吸胃亦佳、</p>

<p>迴旋多日之紗市、咋則叉　上騰、此因原料來源仍無疏通希望、日廠减工允甚、同時廣幫對於二十三支及十支粗紗、需要殷切、市塲謠詠紛紜、皆屬利於多頭、由此買風奇熾、市價乃逐步前進、二十支雙馬再現新高峯矣、今日有棉紗一千九百三十件運香港、</p>
<p>現紗晨開、承上週末熱烈之人氣而升、二十支雙馬首盤價爲一千一百丸十元、少頃跌至一千一百七十八元、未幾聞日紗大漲、人心激昂、買風驀地而起、直漲至一千二百零三元、此時多頭　利稍有吐出、又見回小至一千一百九十七元、迨至十一時以後、買聲忽振、人心挺秀、只見買手、賣出者寥寥無幾、重形漲至一千二白二十二元收盤、查半日問成交統計五千九百九十包、行情二十支雙馬漲五十四元、收盤以後續見上升、茲將各幫口買去之額量、分列如左、</p>

<p>本埠美僑、對於華盛頓號及曼哈丹號二郵船被遣來遠東撤退美國僑民之消息、頗感熱望、此間多數僑深信美政府之遣派二郵船來此、顯示遠東局勢較以前所想像者更為嚴重、週未記者所作之調查、若干美僑認美日兩國不致有事於遠東、故對國務院勸告「無必要」之美僑撇離遠東一舉、原取觀望態度、但自兩郵船奉命於十二日離紐的來滬消息發表後、本埠美僑、均已開始作撒退之準備、摒擋行裝、先將妻子兒女等、遺送歸國、惟重要美商行號之男職員、則仍表示決心留滬、</p>
<p>兩大郵船　設備富麗</p>
<p>昨日本報所載華盛頓電、美政府已調派華盛頓號曼哈丹號兩巨郵輪、赴遠東各地、載運美僑撇退回國、該兩巨輪係United　States　Lines所有、由本市美國總統輪船公司代理、行駛大西洋航錢、卽紐的至意大利之奈潑斯（Naples）及熱拿亞班、總噸位的四萬噸、凈噸爲二萬四千二百八十九噸、船長七百零五呎、闊八十六呎、較行駛太平洋航綫之美郵船柯立芝總統號、的大百分之二十強、與英商昌興公司世界班巨輪不列顚皇后號（每年來滬一决、不入浦江、在吳淞口外拋泊）相仿、兩巨輪噸位船身相同、爲姊妹船、客位分叫等、曼哈丹號　六位、計頭等六十九、二號九十八、三等廿四、四等二十六、華盛頓號頭等六十九、（同）、二等九十八（同）、三等十九（少五）、四等二十五（少一）、內部設備、亦大致相同、如餐廳·吸烟室·游泳池·甲板網球塲·升降梯·房內浴室等、應有盡有、均極富麗、等於海上皇宮、據美國總統輪船公司云、對於兩巨輪行駛遠東、載回僑民事、尚未接總行電知、諒因政府徵發、暫時無消息、大的須兩輪啟程後、始可有通告、</p>
<p>預定船位　尚不擁擠</p>
<p>惟昨日已有美僑至該公司詢問、並擬預定兩巨輪之艙位、公司方面、因　行尚無通知、未便辦理手續、均已婉言答覆、又據美代理總領事布德立稱、發與美僑之通告、其中一部份已有答復、但申請預定船位準備撒退者、並不擁擠、本埠美國商會會長史密斯對記者稱、美會長對於此事、並不作何決定、認爲美總領事署處置此事、甚使一般人滿意云、據前仟工部局總董美籍律師樊克令稱、「余仍不明何故余之家屬不應與余同留此間之原因、」</p>
<p>大使家屬　定期歸國</p>
<p>路透社十四日北平電、美大使館衛兵家屬共的婦孺叫十人、刻正收拾行裝、因奉有美國海軍部之命令、退出北平也、旅平美僑現共有五百四十人、其中有七十人已請求儘量離平、尚有百人欲於局勢惡化時出境、餘者則非至時局嚴重已極時、不願他往、美大使詹森夫人與子女兩人及美大使館員家屬若干人、定十一月七日由上海乘柯立芝總統號出發、</p>
<p>多數美僑　準備離境</p>
<p>英文大美晚報云、本市美僑、今日（十四日）對於美國華盛頓號與曼哈丹號兩大郵船派來漯東撒退美僑之訊、揣測紛紜、許多美僑相信美政府派該兩郵船前來、足見遠東局勢、遠較此前一般人所料者爲嚴重、據記者於週杪調查所悉、上海美僑大多數收拾行裝、準備離境、惟美僑之認爲「不致發生變動」者、亦不乏人、</p>
<h3 id="c84">美旗艦奧古斯泰　傳於明日離滬　在滬美後備兵本週出發　將有廿一人登旗艦工作 <a href="#c84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>英文大美晚報云、今（十四日）晨據本市消息、美國亞洲艦隊旗艦奧古斯泰號料將於星期三日（卽明日）離滬、目的地不明、記者頃以此說叩諸奧古斯泰號上美海軍官佐、彼等旣不加證實、亦不予吾認、</p>
<p>滬後備兵　上輪執役</p>
<p>旅滬美海軍後備兵可望於本週內登奧古期泰號、聞本市美海軍後備兵共六十人中、約有二十一人將確實在該旗艦上服役、餘者不久或將返美國、擔任岸上職務、咋（十三日）夜本市美海軍後備隊在美艦隊後備隊俱樂部舉行末次聚餐、</p>
<p>郵船侍者　應召入伍</p>
<p>又聞昨日靠泊上海之美郵船茄菲爾總統號上侍者數人、將於行抵馬尼刺時離輪加入美艦隊服役、蓋彼等皆屬美海軍後備隊、已接調入美海軍之訓令也、</p>
<p>領署方面　續發通知</p>
<p>就整個美僑而言、則當初因美國務院勸告「非必要」美人撒離遠東而引起之激動、現已大見消滅、美領署於昨今兩日紛以勸告撇退之通知書、寄交本市各登記美僑、據美領署書面聲稱、領署以通知書寄予業已登記之令體美僑後、並將以是項通知齊寄發未登記美僑</p>
<p>附有表格　調查人數</p>
<p>查通知書內戰有美國務院上週發出之通告、勸　僑返國通知書內附有表格、以便接書美僑塡明闔家幾人等項、其目的在使輪船公司便於辦理、上海方面今日接訊、華北美商德士古火油公司職員、已接返國通知、而本市美孚油公司·花旗銀行·與德十古火油公司職員、上週卽已接撤離遠東之同樣通知、</p>

<p>滇緬路定十八日（星期五）重行開放後、本埠外商正積極準備取道該綫運輸商貨、據外商進出口行消息、上海美英法等商、現以運輸路綫恢復暢通、紛向中國內地訂購大批鎢錫鋁桐油等各種重要金屬原料、將經滇緬路出口、至美政府向中國購得之鎢礦砂、其中一萬五千餘噸已集中昆明、正待機裝車輸出、</p>
<p>內運路徑</p>
<p>上海仰光間向無定期輪隻、不定期船直放偶而有之、平時貨件大多均由新加坡轉道、茲因滇緬路十八日開放、故英美各航商決增輪行駛上海·香港·仰光·間航綫、必要時或再新闢上海仰光間直航、此後由滬運川滇黔各省貨物、均將運至仰光、再循滇緬公路、轉西南及西北各省、惟運費水脚較滇越路及浙溫甬轉運稍昂、</p>
<p>籌備內銷</p>
<p>上海各國貨工廠所出品之貨物、以行銷西南西北各省、爲唯一之大主顧、自滇緬路暫行封鎖、無法輸入內地、存貨堆積、價格低落、實銷毫無、自聞滇緬路開放後、各業甚爲振奮、認爲此後之客貨、得循滇緬路輸入、上海工商各業、得以復蘇、此實滬工商界所翹望、聞已派專員赴仰光、接洽關於滬川黔滇聯運事宜、</p>
<p>滬防直通</p>
<p>當茲英輪停航越屬口岸聲中、法國船隻仍行駛滬防兩地、並不中輟、據悉法輪叫艘、將行駛於海防西貢之間、爲期已不在遠、本月二十日卽有洛司輪由滬直放海防、該輪准十八日到埠、輪泊虹口順泰碼頭、第二艘爲雅羅輪、亦於十八日到、二十三日開往、該兩輪同日到埠、自西貢運來大批洋米有七千五百噸、的八萬包之鉅、至於金第亞輪、則可於二十五日來滬、泊華成碼頭、二十七日由滬直放海防西貢、兼裝貨物、另有大達南郵船一艘、亦將於本月底抵此、以上叫輪、均歸法租界外灘九號法國郵船公司經理、此後西貢各地運滬貨物及貢米、均可由法郵運抵上海、毫無異疑、至於英掄何日復航有待英海軍部決定、</p>

<h3 id="c90">追念奧國精神病專家　華格納葉雷克教授（一）　瘋人全身麻痹症的克服者 <a href="#c90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>— 韓芬著—夏楚譯</p>
<p>維也納精神病院院長余利烏斯。華格納葉雷克氏（Julius　Weguer.Tauregg）最近布奧國逝世。按我國政府前曾請華氏派員來華指導精神病醫療事宜。氏乃於一九三三年派其高足韓芬女醫師（Dr．Fanny　G．Haipern）來華服務。華氏對於中國精神病學之進展情形，，備極關切，對於各種病理，時有切當之指導。對於中國西部所常見之甲狀腺腫病，亦特感興趣。目下吾國醫校所用之腦部圖表，亦係採自維也納精神病院者。華氏逝世後，全球對此最有貢獻之醫界鬬士，莫不表示震悼。韓芬醫師現任本埠聖的翰大學醫學院精神病學敎授兼愚園路一七七一號紅　字會神經病科醫師，最近經醫界友人之催促，特爲文追念共老師。本文經韓芥醫師之特許，亟爲譯出，在本報發表，以餉國人。</p>
<p>華格納葉笛克敎授是用處疾法來醫療瘋人全身麻痺症的發明家，亦楚一九二八年諾貝爾獎金的得主，現在以八十三歲的高齡逝世了，消息傳來，不僅醫藥界爲之痛悼，就是一般人士，只要關心這輩限病魔死神相搏鬬的勇士的，亦莫不惋惜不置。</p>
<p>從一九二四年到一九三三年，我很榮幸的在維也納大學受到這位精神病大師的敎誨，同他一起研究。古話說得好：「只有好人才能做好醫生」，這句話　確，無疑能應用到華敎授身上。凡是和他有私交的，凡是和他一同工作過的，現在都不僅覺得失掉了他們的導師，而且亦失掉了他們一個良朋；他們雖然或者同他犬涯海角重洋睽隔，然而仍舊無時不受到他的指導和啟迪。</p>
<p>他賦與了人類掃除全身麻痺症的能力，然叨他所給你的印象，決不是一個革命家。他面上的皺紋已成了他的標記，他的兩目陰沉而慈祥，一年復一年的你可以看見他在陰暗的維也納精神病院裹踱來踱去。他身上從不穿人衣，不論冬夏總帶一頂黑色軟呢的垂邊帽，穿了一身黑衣，老式的衣領翻轉着，掛了一條高資的老式黑領帶—他這樣子在維也納街頭上人人知道。</p>
<p>他是一個眞正的醫生，他愛自然，他觀察自然，他父知道如何從觀察裹推引出實際的結論。他所認爲頂要緊的是疾病的醫療和病人的健康，這些比　有趣的實騐或頂動人的假設都重要得多。任何過甚其辭，或是太重理論的科學工作，和他都沒有緣，然而他還是寬容的，他用溫厚德同情態度來對付。　（未完）</p>

<p>— 瑞華</p>
<p>朋友都說我是個幸福的人，因爲我生長在一個富裕的家庭裹，過着安定的生活。然而，他們父怎能明瞭我的內心呀！一腔怒火在直冒着：悄怒，怨恨，對家庭的一切的反感。</p>
<p>我的父親是個非常隨便的人，靠着先祖的產業，過着很優閒的生活。但是他那畸形的嗜好，却使他終日的忙着，很少在家裹住上一整天。母親在我九歲的一年就逝世了，遺下的只有我一個人。繼母的來歷，我不十分明瞭，只聽說是一生意浪」來的，因爲很多人都這樣說。</p>
<p>起初，繼母的脾氣還很好，對待我也相當慈愛，時常地親自來照料，有時竟使我忘却了還有個死去的母親在泉下。別人都說這是我的幸運，我自己也覺得不錯。</p>
<p>可是，沒有到一年，我終於嘗到了晚娘的拳頭。她拿出了本來的面目，變得非常的可怕，非但她勢利眼光特別兇而且嘴也生得非常毒。每個人在她的心目中看來，都有一大篇怪好聽的批評，嚇得親戚們都不敢上門，她却沒有自覺，反怪他們太冷淡了。</p>
<p>隔了一年她父領了一個七歲的女孩進來，做了我的妹妹，據說是她的親戚，可是旁的人說，倒是她的親生女。這點，只有繼母自己肚裹明白了。</p>
<p>從此，家裹又多了一位健吵份子，他們倆一搭一檔地，可以爲了些微的小事，鬧得滿城風雨，東去尋岔，西去相駡，直使家宅不安，父親却始終不說一句。因此，造成她更大胆，更潑辣，對家裏的人，沒有一個不曾相駡的，就是僕人也沒有一個做得長的。終於祖母受不住她的雌威第一個同着姑母出外別居了，接着叔父母們也搬走了，頓時，一個熱鬧的大家庭，變成了冷淸淸的。我也感到了無趣，索性住在學校裹，很少到家裹去。卽使放假，我也會住在和母那裹。因此，那叫年中，我跟繼母，妹妹，以及父親，似乎很疎遠了。</p>
<p>戰爭將我的生活又改變了，校長沒有住宿，我不得不回到家裏。起先還希望繼母可以溫柔些了，妹妹也大了可以不再尋岔子了。誰知結果給我的印象，却並不如此。父親還是整天在外，甚至要到天明方返。繼母除了時常出去外，終朝的跟朋友在家裹打牌，仍是那麼的勢利，喜講別人，同人尋岔，相駡，她還是從前的她，我失望了。妹妹雖然也在讀書了，可是她的脾氣跟繼母一樣的糊塗。有時家裏三缺一；她竟會拋了校裏的課本，坐下來湊一局。對於她，我又失望了。</p>
<p>三年了，整個的家庭，還是籠罩着烏烟瘴氣，衰敗現象。我在家裏，始終孤獨着，因爲我沒有跟他們一樣的糊塗。憤怒，怨恨，在我的心頭火熾，我只有埋頭苦幹，預備自立的一天，可以遠走高飛，永遠晚離這腐敗的家庭。</p>
<p>霍桑探案</p>

<p>第九章　驚人消息</p>
<p>倪金壽又說：「霍先生，還有呢。據秦默齋告訴我，白醫生剖騐的結果，竟說王麗蘭是被刀尖刺破了心房致命的，並不是被槍彈打死的。霍先生，你想這事僵不僵？我們的這半天工夫，不是都白忙嗎！」</p>
<p>霍桑一聽這句，他的神經上，好像起了劇烈的變動。他把聽筒在電話機上一擱，竟不再說話。他在電話機旁邊，靜默了兩三秒鐘，便舉起左手，看看他腕上的手錶。接着，他的險上忽現出一絲苦笑。</p>
<p>「包朗，你眞有先見之明！我不能不佩服你！——現在已兩點半了。」</p>
<p>我覺得他的話，簡直近於不倫不類。莫非這個消息的刺激太劇烈了，他的鐵一般的堅定的神經，也承受不住，竟會因此而喪失了它的常度？我還找不出安慰的語句，他忽然說出幾句比較有條理的說話來。</p>
<p>「包朗，我現在馬上要到警廳裏去，瞧瞧那位廳長大人。你不必跟我去。」他向我的臉瞧了一瞧，又笑着說：「你放心，我決不會跟他鬧翻。我衣袋裹雖有手槍，也決不會亂用。你還不瞭解我，我的神經跟你一樣健全——也許比你更健全些。我所以不讓你一塊兒去，因爲我還要你担任其他任務。」</p>
<p>我問道：「那末，你要我做什麼事？」</p>
<p>霍桑道：「你再過半個鐘頭，就到王麗蘭家裹去，先把老毛的皮鞋量一量。」</p>
<p>我應道：「好這個容易。以後還有什麼事？」</p>
<p>「第二步，你，請那老頭兒李芝範，叫他在樓下客室中陪你談話—喂，你須記着，你跟他談話的地點，應得在會客室裹面。還有兩個條件你把會客室的門關着，還須把那鋼窗上黃色的窗帘拉下。」</p>

<h3 id="c118">去學別人 <a href="#c118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>— 人安</p>
<p>敎育的　義，便是根據經騐去確認努力的門徑，其目的正是求减少錯誤和失敗。於此，歷史是對於現實的借鏡，所謂成功人鑑的傳記文章裹，正告訴我們若十努力的門徑。</p>
<p>但如果從「畫虎不成反類犬」一語中去研究，這「去學別人」的舉動，也不是一件簡便的事呢！</p>
<p>眼前，一般人以爲成敗有自然的鐵偉。經理先生以從學徒到現在的高位爲人生天經地義，要自已的學徒去一一效法；阿爸以自已自銅匠做到富翁爲滿腹經綸，要大學畢業的見子也去站在鎔鑪邊。這不獨是個性太強的先生們自已太傻，而易會使靑年人誤解學問加努力等於成功的自然定律。現在和過去的現實環境不同，我們又怎能再來一决的翻本古書呢！</p>
<p>然而，我絕非否定前輩的努力。但，我們去學別人時，固然應該學他們的努力精神，却更應認識他所處的實際環境，以及我們自已的實際環境。於此，我們要去學別人，應先對別人明確的認識。</p>
<p>同時，我們更要明白，我所以要學別人的原因，不是在聲音笑貌的推究。有許多自以爲聰明的君子，亦步亦趨的去學別人家的小動作，傀儡抱笏登塲一般，唱戲的伶人也似的，衣冠楚楚，儼然帝王，須知天虛我生（陳蝶仙先生）的成功不在聲音笑貌，張三李叫生有和吳蘊初先生一般的面貌，沒有努力和奮鬥，也是不會成爲味精發明人的。郁達夫的成功決不在浪漫和喝酒，如果祇去嫖女人和喝酒，那祇成功一個浪子，那裹配稱文學家！</p>
<p>准此，我們去學別人，應該學實際努力才是！</p>
<p>不過，天下沒有毫無缺點的完人，我們對於別人的過去，未必要去全盤接受地去學。所謂盡信書不如無書，最經濟的辨法是把握着可以學習的一點。我們對於研討寫字和畫畫方面，一般人都是以師某人筆意自豪，然而最成功的人却是溶和各家，或是自成一家的。鄭板橋本也是刻意摹擬的，到後來，却悟到「人各有體」四字，才够成名。</p>
<p>所以，取法乎上，而得乎中，這是對於一家的學習，取乎各家之所長，而得乎共各部之發展，這不獨是靑出於藍而勝於藍，而且是能食能化的上乘之「去學別人」的方法了。</p>
<h3 id="c119">人生的危機（一） <a href="#c119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>那耶穌曾經教訓人說：「不要爲自己積攢財寶在地上，地上有蟲子咬，能銹壞，也有賊挖掘窿來偷、只要積攢財寶在天上，天上沒有蟲子咬，不能銹壞，也沒有挖掘窿來偷。因爲你們的財寶在那裏，你們的心也在那裏。（馬太六19-21</p>
<p>物們要明白這段聖經，先當知道這裏所用的「財寶」兩字，在希臘原文是「珍寶」。錢財雖屬珍寶，但珍寶不防限於錢財、耶穌說『你的財寶在那時，你的心也那裏』，顯見得耶穌是注重人的心，而不是財寶。我們常見人們身外之物增加以且，他們的內心反而縮小了。先是財寶供人使用，後來人就降爲財寶的奴隸供財寶驅使了。所謂人後的危機，就是在此。因爲人仌的心，容易受侵蝕，容易墮落，容易被盜，現在我們把這三點，分開來談談：</p>
<p>（一）有蟲蛀：所謂蟲蛀，是指傳染而言。隨便甚麼東西，只要有一個蟲侵入，不久便會藩殖而成爲千千萬萬，直到那東西蛀空爲止。侵害人格的蟲，就是罪惡。起初是極小的。後來由小而大，由輕而衙，由淺而深，生生不已，正可以將一個人的人格，完全吃盡，久而久之，把人領到滅亡的路上去。所以我們謹防我們的心，生傳染病，不要讓這種人格的蟲侵入，致生蟲蛀的危險。世界上有許多罪惡，大半都是爲了財寶。所有偷竊，侵占，搜刮，盤剝，攘奪，以及勒索種種罪惡，無一不是由於財報爲之厲階。如果富有的人，爲了自己失格，善用其所用，貧窮的人，也能爲了自己的人格，對於別人的所有，不紅眼，不垂涎，則社會間的罪惡，可以消弭不少。（十八日再登）</p>

<p>— 鄒嘯</p>
<p>最近有兩種大明的史劇演：其一是新藝劇社的「海國英雄」，魏如晦編；又其一是上海劇藝社的「大明英烈傳」，于伶編；這兩種史劇是各有千秋的。</p>
<p>魏作處處根據史實，參考書達三百種，說明書是一本小冊子，其中對人物考證甚詳，可見引用書目的一斑，這是有考據癖的如晦的特點：于作則大部分不據史實，除夫劉伯溫常遇春爲歷史人物外，其他連女主角蘇佼佼在內，大部分都不是歷史上所有的，但却並不是完全想像的，雖無歷史的根據，却有事實的根據，我們仔細看去，可以想像其一二，總之世間是有這樣可歌可泣的事情的。</p>
<p>但這兩種史劇都在結構方面盡了很大的努力。魏作可稱爲「後本葛嫩娘」，所以第二幕鄭鴻達提起「前决葛嫩娘來的時候，我就和他大鬧過一塲」。第四幕馬余子上塲，又是一陣「他媽的」，這都能引起觀衆的興趣。第三幕又提起張煌言的來信，那末是預備牽引到第四部南明史劇「懸嶼孤猿」上去了。照舊小說講，這些說是「照應」和「伏筆」吧。他如第三幕用兩决「喑換」來替代二晝夜的戰爭：第四幕滄兒見鄭經時追叙前情，都是結構佳妙之處。于伶的作品一向是向多面發展，不大有緊湊結構的，如花濺淚·女子公寓·女兒國·夜上海等，此决却例外地有了完整的結構。末幕有類蘇聯的影片「女壯士」。</p>
<p>同時，這兩種劇本都是以勝利和樂觀結束的，都竭力避免失敗主義，于作取材明初，歷史有據，當然是勝利的；魏作則寫至鄭成功重振義師，擬再度北伐爲止，像歐陽的「梁紅玉」一樣，最後仍舊給我們極大的興奮。</p>
<p>我們看過這兩種劇本之後，該可以從這兒得到不少的絃外之音吧？</p>

<p>— 葉嘉樂</p>
<p>蘇聯的海蘭泡和黑龍江的璦琿是遙遙相對的：看到彈詞界的沈儉安，與評話界的許繼祥，也可說是遙遙相對，一個是啞派珠塔，紅遍書壇，一個是啞派英烈，響極一時，現在把他倆分述如後：</p>
<p>「珍珠塔」，爲小書之王，是誰都不能吾認的，因爲這部書最含有書卷氣的緣故。講到說珠塔的人才，眞是層出不窮。但是前够說得出神入化的，却寥寥無幾，除魏鈺卿以汁，祇沈儉安一人。口齒的老練，書路的細膩，兼以啞中帶糯的嗓子，當然都是他優秀的條件。他的良配薛筱卿，素以琵琶玲瓏著名，所以彈唱時，啞嗓和琵琶，調和一起，更覺韻味十足。他的撒手　像方卿見姑娘，打三不孝，哭訴陳翠娥等，早就響透了。</p>
<p>「吐血四官」，就是許繼祥的綽號。這當然顯出他是體弱的。論起他的書藝，衷氣却談不到，嗓音啞而不沙，書路純淸，絲毫不蕪雜；起角色不很注重，除却老牌胡大海，其他大都敷衍了事。出噱頭，是他的拿手戲，在說書界中首屈一指。往往說到精彩處，妙語橫生，襯着他那副啼笑皆非的尊容，當然博得全堂笑聲，所以我大膽敢說，他的紅，十分之八九在噱頭上得到的。</p>
<p>總之，沈儉安與許繼祥都是現今的紅檔，也無須我再捧，希望他們要好好地保持現在的地位。</p>

<p>New York: A group of Americans sympathetic to China has formed the American Committee for Chinese Industrial Cooperatives, led by First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt and chaired by Rear Admiral Yarnell, former commander of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet. The committee aims to raise funds to strengthen the industrial cooperatives established by Chinese people in the free areas, of which more than two thousand have already been established, specializing in the manufacture of various tools and daily necessities. The technical advisor of the cooperative is a New Zealander named Alley. (Reuters, 14th)</p>

<p>Washington: President Roosevelt, at the opening of the annual "Mobilization for Human Needs" campaign here last night, urged Americans to generously support private charitable causes. The President stated, "This year is no less important than previous years. We need to expand our strength. Events abroad have warned us that we need not only a large number of airplanes, tanks, ships, and cannons, but they have also warned us that we should be prepared to make greater sacrifices, bravery, etc., to promote the nation's morale." (United Press, 14th)</p>
<p>Washington: A prominent South American diplomatic expert stated to the United States today that, as a result of discussions with other South American diplomats, he is convinced that South American countries will firmly support the United States' policy of opposing Japanese expansion in the Far East. It is said that, should a conflict arise between the United States and Japan, South American countries will assist the United States with resources. As to whether Pan-America will jointly issue a policy to deal with the Far East after the U.S. declared its protection of Western Hemisphere countries, he did not give a definite answer. (United Press, 14th)</p>
<p>New York: The New York Times reports that Brazil and Chile have agreed to lease naval and air bases to the United States, and the U.S. will bear all expenses for constructing these bases. It is believed that Uruguay may revise its previous decision and agree to lease its bases as well. (Reuters, 14th)</p>
<p>Eugene, Oregon: Japanese Foreign Minister Yosuke Matsuoka, in an article for his alma mater, the University of Oregon's school newspaper, stated today that Japan's position is being wrongly condemned by international public opinion. He wrote, "Among my countrymen, there are many ideas that cannot understand other so-called armed conflicts except for the word 'conquest'." However, he stated that this way of thinking is not popular. Matsuoka added that the East needs the opportunity to build its own house and live its life under a new order created by its own ideas. "Japan assumes a leading position because other countries are incapable." (United Press, 14th)</p>
<p>Chongqing: Naval experts here express doubts about the possibility of any major naval battles between the U.S. and Japanese fleets in the event of a deterioration in U.S.-Japan relations. They anticipate that small-scale battles may be unavoidable, but both sides will be unwilling to risk decisive battles far from their bases. A British and American blockade of Japan, unless close to the Japanese mainland, will likely be ineffective, as their strength in the Pacific is insufficient for a long-distance blockade. These experts believe that once the U.S. fleet moves to Singapore, the Japanese fleet will attempt to intercept it in the ocean. (Reuters, 14th)</p>

<p>Washington: Government officials continued to hold meetings over the weekend to discuss all matters related to accelerating the evacuation of American nationals from the Far East. The official statement emphasized that the "Manhattan" and "Washington" liners have been ordered by the authorities to sail to the East as soon as possible to assist in the evacuation. However, as of this morning, the date of departure and the routes of these two liners have not yet been announced. (United Press, 14th)</p>
<p>Tokyo: According to semi-official Japanese sources, the Harbin branch of Citibank has closed its deposit department, largely in response to the U.S. State Department's order to evacuate American nationals from the Far East. (Reuters, 14th)</p>
<p>New York: The New York Times, discussing U.S.-Japan relations, stated that the U.S. today is as unintimidated as it was sixteen years ago. Sixteen years ago, the Japanese Ambassador to the U.S., Kijūrō Shidehara, told Secretary of State Hughes that if the U.S. established legislation to abolish the Gentlemen's Agreement and prevent Japanese immigrants from entering the U.S., it would have serious consequences on U.S.-Japan relations. Today, Japanese newspapers, under strict censorship, not only echo Ambassador Shidehara's remarks about retaliating against the U.S., but also threaten a Pacific war to end U.S. aid to China and Britain. If the Japanese are not forgetful, then the experience gained by Shidehara in those years should serve as a lesson. The U.S. can be deceived by clever tactics, but it cannot be intimidated. Today is the same as it was sixteen years ago. (United Press, 14th)</p>

<p>Berlin: German officials have generally refused to comment on President Roosevelt's speech in Dayton. (Haitong News Agency, 14th)</p>
<p>Rome: Fascist political circles expressed the opinion yesterday that President Roosevelt's speech in Dayton has paved the way for the U.S. to join the war on the British side soon. These political circles said that this speech shattered all hopes for an understanding between the U.S. and the Axis powers. Some authoritative spokesmen here believe that President Roosevelt's remarks are "a declaration of an initial state of war." The spokesman said that relations between the U.S. and the Axis powers have reached a new low. (Nazi spokesmen in Berlin refused to give any special criticism of the U.S. president's speech yesterday, saying they had not yet read the full text of the speech. However, one spokesman said, "The full text of the speech will be thoroughly studied as the basis for any subsequent actions." In his Dayton speech, President Roosevelt declared the principle of the Western Hemisphere being "all for one, one for all," criticized the new alliance between the Axis powers and Japan, and declared that the U.S. is determined to continue providing military assistance to Britain because Britain's courageous war is resisting aggression outside our coast.) Informed Fascist party members solemnly stated yesterday that the Axis powers' greatly increased animosity is the result of President Roosevelt's "contemptuous remarks" towards dictators. The tough attitude adopted by the U.S. President towards totalitarian states in his speech is seen here as a sign of rising U.S. war sentiment. A prominent Fascist party member told reporters today, "Italy should fulfill its responsibilities and prepare to deal with this situation." (United Press, 14th)</p>
<h3 id="e5">Japanese Side Indicates: Fewer Statements the Better <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo: Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman Suma refused to comment today on President Roosevelt's speech in Dayton, on the grounds that Tokyo has not yet received the official full text of the speech. Suma said, "At this point, fewer statements are better." (United Press, 14th)</p>
<p>Tokyo: President Roosevelt's speech in Dayton on Saturday has attracted widespread attention because it was the first formal expression of opinion by the U.S. regarding the Tripartite Pact, and announced the U.S. government's intention to increase aid to Britain and China. According to semi-official Japanese sources, political observers believe that this speech is intended to sensationalize the public before the election. (Reuters, 14th)</p>
<p>Tokyo: The Yomiuri Shimbun, which often reflects the will of the Japanese high command, stated today that the U.S. has shown a "hostile attitude" toward the Axis powers and the new tripartite alliance. The Yomiuri Shimbun believes that President Roosevelt's speech in Dayton yesterday was the official response of the U.S. to the German, Italian, and Japanese pact. The newspaper said that the President's move clearly misunderstands what the nations that signed the pact expect from the U.S., because the signing of the Tripartite Pact was not intended to deal with any particular country. The newspaper also criticized the U.S.'s mistaken view, stating that the purpose of the pact is to prevent the spread of war, not to cause new wars. The Yomiuri Shimbun criticized the President for making unfriendly references to the three countries. The newspaper said that President Roosevelt often referred to the three countries as "united enemy countries." The newspaper continued, saying that President Roosevelt's motive in the Dayton speech may be to use it to promote his re-election campaign, but in the opinion of the newspaper, the speech is greatly suspected of inciting war. Tokyo newspapers today competed to publish the full text of the President's speech yesterday, and all put headlines of the same nature at the beginning of the speech. The headline of the White Day News said, "The U.S. Will Completely Abandon its 'Appeasement Policy'." The largest commercial newspaper, "Chugai Shimbun," attacked the "irresponsible remarks towards Japan" of American leaders. The newspaper said, "If they think that tough words can intimidate Japan, then they lack an understanding of the current situation." The Hochi Shimbun claimed, "The reason why American political circles are making almost comical remarks is that they misunderstand the true meaning of the tripartite alliance. The American people may think that the tripartite alliance is aimed at the United States, so they are deeply afraid that the Axis powers will directly attack the United States." The newspaper continued, "However, if the United States insists that the construction of a new order in the world by the three countries is an unfair and unreasonable move, then war between the United States and the Axis powers is inevitable." Someone in the Yomiuri Shimbun selected a commentary that said, "It is incomprehensible why American nationals need to be evacuated from the Far East. Japanese nationals abroad, on the contrary, have no intention of panicking.

<p>Tokyo: The Nichinichi Shimbun stated today that the Japanese government has already decided to sincerely promote the Southern Advance Policy since the conclusion of a "national alliance to protect the uniformity of diplomatic opinions." Furthermore, with Vietnam granting military facilities and friendly relations with Thailand, Japan's foundation for the Southern Advance has long been established.

The newspaper also claimed that the Japanese government's policy is to launch the Southern Advance as soon as possible in order to seek an early resolution of the China Incident. As for the increasing economic pressure from Britain and the United States, since it is unavoidable, Japan must rebuild its economic system. (United Press, 14th)</p>

<p>Tunxi: On the 12th, more than 2,000 Japanese soldiers invaded Xuancheng from the northwest and southwest sides. One force was encircled and attacked by Chinese troops north of the city, suffering almost complete casualties. Another force, under the cover of artillery fire, entered the city and engaged in fierce street fighting with the Chinese troops. The Chinese troops inflicted heavy losses on the Japanese on one side, and dispatched a unit on the other side, detouring to the north of the city, uniting with reinforcements, and completely eliminating the Japanese outside the city. They then joined forces to launch a fierce attack on the Japanese troops in the city, annihilating a large number of Japanese troops. The Japanese did not dare to resist stubbornly, so they broke out of the city. The Chinese troops annihilated more than 1,000 Japanese troops in this battle. They have now entered the city to comfort and gather refugees, and at the same time sent troops to take advantage of the victory to pursue the fleeing Japanese troops. On the afternoon of the 13th, the Japanese reinforcements advanced to Yicheng on Jiulishan (between Wanzhi and Xuancheng), and the Chinese troops pursued them immediately. The Japanese troops were already extremely embarrassed under the encirclement of the Chinese troops on all sides. Now the Chinese troops are stepping up their pursuit. (13th)</p>

<h3 id="e12">The Brewing and Unfolding of International Competition <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>Four days ago, the Soviet Union solemnly guaranteed that its policy of aiding China would never change. We are deeply gratified that our observations and judgments in our recent reviews of the Soviet Union's attitude were fortunately accurate. At the same time, it is even more certain that amidst the various difficult-to-grasp aspects of the Soviet Union's international stance, this clear aspect is first obtained, giving a consensus to the international community. The new Japanese ambassador to the Soviet Union has taken office, and the Japanese side says that he has been given full power to conduct all negotiations. Recently, Japanese Prime Minister Konoe made a statement, saying that Soviet-Japanese negotiations are underway. Yesterday, news from Berlin relayed by Tokyo said that Germany had dispatched a mission to Moscow to promote the re-rapprochement between the Soviet Union and Japan. If the central goal of all kinds of actions related to the Soviet Union and Japan is, as Japan has repeatedly stated, to hope to complete its so-called resolution of the China Incident by striving to adjust Soviet-Japanese relations, then the significance of the above-mentioned various actions has been head-on attacked by the Soviet Union's guarantee not to change its policy of aiding China, giving it a failed answer in advance.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union, established in the international community, must have its fundamental grand plan; as for the application of policies, it is of course unconventional, but it does not deviate from its foundation. Therefore, the success or failure of the competition between the Anglo-American and German-Japanese sides to pursue Moscow is at most within the temporary and partial angle of the Soviet policy; perhaps there will be elasticity as a result; beyond this angle, it is ultimately tangential. The Soviet-German alliance, the Soviet Union never sided with Germany and fought against Britain; the recent global chaos, the Soviet Union never hesitated in its approach to aiding China; this is a clear category. However, how to use elasticity between them must be coordinated and echoed with other international situations; therefore, the Soviet Union, which has never boasted about its aid to China in silence for several years, this time, at the same time as Britain abandoned its Far Eastern compromise policy and reopened the Yunnan-Burma transportation, solemnly declared that it would not change its policy of aiding China, encouraging Britain's determination and expressing the mutual adaptation between them. We do not need to overstate how important the meaning of such mutual adaptation is; however, ten days ago, it seemed that the world was expecting the Soviet Union to take the lead in speaking out for Britain and the United States; and at that time, our observation was that "the Soviet Union's attitude towards it is clear, and Britain and the United States do not need to have any new expectations for this; on the contrary, whether the Soviet Union is willing to take a step further and have better actions in the Far East. It is probably after Britain and the United States have taken decisive action"; to let the Soviet Union "launch" everything, "first look at Britain and the United States." From this kind of observation, compared with this time the Soviet Union's declared guarantee, if we try to speculate, we cannot deny that there is a subtle breath between them! Following this pursuit, although the Soviet Union has grasped a very high proportion of decisive factors in the Far Eastern changes and is the focus of world attention, that is, what everyone expects; however, the dynamic fulcrum that the public should pay attention to is not there, but in the Anglo-American in the South Asian evolution. Britain and the United States, especially the United States, have recently been active and energetic in the Far East, and they have probably seen through the key points.</p>
<p>Of course, Britain's and the United States' current vigorous rise, sharing the heavy responsibility in the Far East, is absolutely not comparable to the negligence and contempt of the Soviet Union in the Munich era; but looking at how harmoniously and thoroughly the United States has recently been in diplomacy and material supply to the Soviet Union, it can not only be used as a counter-evidence that it does not neglect or despise the Soviet Union, but also be regarded as the United States' sincere practice of doing its best for the Soviet Union. Some commentators believe that the Anglo-American intention is so, it is not allowed to quickly allow it to be the certainty of the Anglo-American binding of the Soviet Union; moreover, the Soviet Union has always been called an inscrutable mystery, and its actions may go beyond the Anglo-American surprise, causing the Anglo-American to reap the opposite consequences? No one can make a necessary prophecy for this hypothetical fork in the road. And the prophecy does not bear the responsibility of fulfillment, although the prophecy is also useless. However, recently there is no new reason, which can increase some hope for the Anglo-American side. It is because, in the root nature, essence, and long-term interests of the Soviet Union and Germany, Italy, and Japan, there are deep and irreconcilable gaps, irresolvable contradictions, and beyond that, there are things that contradict its fundamental grand plan, but there are also places where the Soviet Union should be cautious and reluctant to face Germany, Italy, and Japan in its temporary and partial policies. Recently, an unnamed reader, Mr. someone, submitted a letter to this newspaper, stating his another observation on the Three-Power Alliance; he said that the Three-Power Alliance clearly faces the United States, and clearly excludes the Soviet Union, but do not forget Mr. Hitler's principle of using unexpected, attacking east and west strategies; he has repeatedly used psychological warfare tactics to divert the opponent's attention, but then suddenly used blitzkrieg tactics to achieve success; therefore, where in the alliance is it clearly excluding the Soviet Union, one should examine its consistent strategy principles and seek its true meaning. He also said: Germany does not want the British Isles, so why must it risk irreversible dangers and pay countless costs to continue attacking the Isles? After he overcame France, the western front was quite stable, so why must he use the alliance to clearly reject the United States from thousands of miles away? The permanent military strategy, which is the resource for establishing a country, is extremely important in the Balkans and Ukraine, and therefore is incompatible with Britain, France, and the Soviet Union from the beginning; now that France has been taken into control, and because of possessing France, it has more than enough to hold Britain, removing two of the three, leaving only a Soviet Union; the alliance clearly excludes "the Soviet Union"; as soon as the alliance was announced, it immediately advanced towards the Balkans and sent troops into Romania. Is this to deal with Britain or to deal with the Soviet Union? This gentleman's argument, we most agree with him on this point about Germany's troops entering Romania. We do not think that the German troops entering Romania are not another aspect of the war against Britain, but we think that this simultaneously emphasized the original contradiction between the Soviet Union and Germany; even if Mr. Hitler does not subjectively use this move to threaten the Soviet Union, in fact, it will probably make the Soviet Union more cautious and reluctant to face Germany because of this move; this is a new reason that is more unfavorable to the British defeat, and it is also to the Anglo-American that it is seeking to win the Soviet Union's sympathy, and it has increased a few new reasons. Yesterday, it was reported that Germany sent a mission to Moscow. Its mission is probably not much for Japan's sake, but its main mission is to explain the entry of troops into Rome, seek understanding, or even promise! International promises often have miraculous effects; but when the benefits are exhausted, the friendship becomes alienated, and the map is poor, then one often sees that is often the case in the chaotic competition.</p>

<p>Chongqing: Three batches of Japanese planes, totaling thirty-nine, raided Liangshan in northeastern Chongqing, Sichuan, this afternoon, bombing it. The first batch of six Japanese planes was discovered here at noon, and a special alarm was issued when they crossed the Sichuan border. The Japanese planes went up the river together and flew towards Chongqing, but when they reached Chongqing, they suddenly turned around and did not appear over the city, probably because of the low cloud cover. After bombing Liangshan, the Japanese planes flew back to their base. According to Chinese military news from the front line in Yichang, yesterday the Chinese mobile artillery suddenly shelled the Yichang Japanese airfield unexpectedly, destroying fourteen of the twenty-nine Japanese planes parked on the ground. (Reuters, 14th)</p>
<p>Chongqing: Today, officials announced that twenty-nine Japanese planes parked at the Yichang airfield were suddenly shelled by nearby Chinese troops yesterday, and fourteen of them were completely destroyed. Since the start of the Sino-Japanese war, this kind of shelling carried out by the Chinese army taking advantage of the Japanese unpreparedness has been one of the most successful. (United Press, 14th)</p>
<p>Kunming: Yesterday afternoon, Kunming suffered the most violent bombing ever. The city of Kunming was almost razed to the ground by Japanese bombers. After the bombing, thick smoke still shrouded the sky, as if the entire city had been destroyed. Although the material damage was great, the loss of life was not much, because most of the residents had taken refuge in air-raid shelters. Yunnan University was also hit. A bomb fell a hundred yards outside the American consulate, slightly damaging the consulate building. The glass windows of the German and British consulates were also shattered. A total of twenty-seven Japanese planes participated in the raid, first attacking a certain target in the south of the city. Where the bombs exploded, tiles and rubble flew up, obscuring the sky like smoke. The Japanese planes ravaged the area in a systematic manner, from north to south. When bombing, Japanese fighter planes flew over the sky, and at one point flew low around the city, and the markings on the wings could be seen with the naked eye. (Reuters, 14th)</p>

<p>Chongqing: Wang Kuangyue, Director of the Navigation Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Communications and concurrently Director of the West River Shipyard, was previously injured in a car accident on his way back from a public trip to Guizhou. He was hospitalized for two weeks and has recently recovered. The reporter made a special visit yesterday and inquired about the Ministry of Communications' recent shipbuilding plans. He gave the following detailed account: The West River Shipyard of the Ministry of Communications originally had three factories in Guizhou, manufacturing wooden boats. To date, more than 570 ships have been completed and added to the navigation lines in Guizhou Province, greatly increasing transportation capacity. Now, because the Jialing River and Yuan River areas are both land-sea combined transportation routes, there is a great need for wooden boats. Although the Navigation Administration Bureau has loaned money to manufacture a large number of wooden boats in various parts of Sichuan Province, it is still insufficient. In order to develop land-sea combined transportation in Sichuan and Hunan and to regulate supply and demand, Minister Zhang ordered this bureau to move the First Factory to a certain location in western Hunan, and the Third Factory to a certain location in northern Sichuan, to rush to manufacture wooden boats. The First Factory will remain in its original location and continue to manufacture. In order to meet the needs of the Xiang and Yuan Rivers for shallow-draft steamships, it has been ordered to establish a Fourth Factory in a certain location in southern Hunan to manufacture shallow-draft steamships. After I went to Guizhou to supervise and promote this task, it has been completed. All factories will be able to start construction at the beginning of next month. There will be new developments in the shipbuilding industry in Sichuan and Hunan. The equipment for the shoals on the Yuan and Jialing Rivers, which the Navigation Administration Bureau has been ordered to increase, is also being actively handled, in order to further improve the speed and safety of water transportation.

<h3 id="e35">German Troops in Romania Show Signs of Advancing South; Soviet Forces in Black Sea Increase Alert; Naval Conflict Between Soviets and Romanians Resolved; Greece, Turkey, and Yugoslavia Prepare to Defend Against Aggression <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>London: A Reuters diplomatic correspondent says that the entry of German troops into Romania may lead to a breakdown in Anglo-Romanian diplomatic relations. The future plans of the Axis powers are still a matter of speculation at this time. However, the general opinion is that Bulgaria and Greece will be the next targets of the Axis powers. The Axis powers will try to force Bulgaria and Greece to follow in the footsteps of Romania. If successful, Axis troops will reach the Bulgarian-Turkish border to threaten Turkey. The ultimate goal of the Axis powers is to subdue Turkey and Egypt by force or threat, so that they can advance to the Suez Canal. If this is indeed the plan of the Axis powers, it is clearly a gamble. Although Turkey and Egypt have not declared war, Turkey has already issued a statement that if there is an invasion, Turkey will respond with two million rifles. British troops are also stationed in Egypt and Palestine, and they will not allow enemy troops to enter. Turkey does not seem to be overly concerned about Germany's occupation of Romania, because it is now too late for German troops to invade Turkey. Even if Axis troops reach the Turkish border, it should not be considered an action that could disrupt the British Empire's very valuable assets. If Greece is invaded, Turkey will not sit idly by, and Britain will occupy Crete and the Ionian Islands in the Mediterranean Sea. This is something the Axis powers cannot ignore.

<p>Madrid: People here are paying close attention to the developments in Romania and the Middle East.

<p>Five British Nationals Detained in Romania for Espionage</p>
<p>Five British nationals were recently arrested here on charges of "pouring acidic liquid into oil bound for Germany". This move has further complicated the already strained relations between Britain and Romania. Well-informed sources predict that Anglo-Romanian relations may become more strained at any time. It is reported that the Romanian government has introduced chemical inspections of every oil tanker bound for Germany to prevent British espionage. In the future, German secret police will cooperate with Romanian secret police. Police were busy yesterday confiscating leaflets opposing German activities in Romania from the public. A large number of leaflets were thrown into government agencies, public places, and newspaper offices throughout the city. However, apart from the leaflets, there was no organized anti-German rule action in the city.

<p>Bucharest: According to yesterday's Afhtong newspaper here, Romanian accounts in Britain and the Empire have been stopped.

<p>Tokyo: News from Berlin has been received here that the German Foreign Office has dispatched a mission to Moscow, hoping to prevent the trend of Anglo-Soviet relations improving. The German ambassador to the Soviet Union, who went to Berlin, flew back to the Soviet Union last night. Neutral observers in Berlin believe that Germany is currently seeking to agree with the Soviet Union on some method of dividing regions, and following the public guidelines set by the Axis powers for Japan, mutually recognizing the other's sphere of influence. Hitler will respect Stalin's "interests" in Afghanistan, Iran, and other Central Asian regions, in exchange for Soviet acquiescence to Germany's invasion of the Balkan Peninsula. Berlin has not expressed hope that the Soviet Union and Japan will approach each other again. (Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Madrid: From the Berlin dispatch of the Spanish Efe News Agency, it is clear that the Germans are now quite suspicious of the Soviet Union's attitude. The correspondent stated the German official view that the strange events that have occurred in the past few days show that German-Soviet relations are "currently" still good. Talks will begin in Moscow in a few days, aimed at auditing the half-year trade surplus between Germany and the Soviet Union, which is a sign that the existing good understanding between the two countries still exists. Therefore, the rumor heard by people in Madrid that after the alliance of Germany, Italy, and Japan, a "surprising diplomatic event" is expected to occur in Moscow may not materialize, and the prospect of improving Soviet-Japanese relations also proves that Stalin does not want to engage in dangerous adventures. (Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Lyon: The Times recently published an editorial commenting on the Soviet Union's attitude, with the meaning that the Soviet Union's position is indeed very important in the current international struggle, but to say that the country's policy will have a drastic change, and that if it does not actively cooperate with the two Axis powers of Germany and Italy, it should approach the two countries of Britain and the United States, is too early to say. In fact, the Soviet Union's current policy, which can avoid being drawn into the vortex of the European war while obtaining so many territorial and economic benefits, will not be rashly changed due to recent events. In short, the goal revealed by the Soviet government is to avoid being drawn into the war as long as its own interests are not directly threatened, to try to improve relations with various countries and to resolve various outstanding issues with its neighbors in a peaceful manner, and to do its best to strengthen its military equipment in order to cope with future events. If the current war in Europe spreads to the Far East and expands into a world war, then the country cannot continue to ignore it. Moreover, the Slavic ethnic groups have always been of concern to the country, and it must pay close attention to the various changes that may occur in the Balkan Peninsula and the Near East. As for the Far East, since Japan joined the German-Italian alliance, the nature of the relationship between Japan and the Soviet Union has been completely changed. (Havas dispatch of the 13th)</p>

<h3 id="e39">British Air Force Bombs Krupp Armaments Factory with Unprecedented Power - Most Fierce Strike Against Germany Since the Start of the War - Dropped Giant Bombs Hit Targets and Started Fires <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>London - Yesterday at dawn, the British Air Force flew to Essen, Germany, and bombed the Krupp steel factory, the largest in Europe, for two hours, inflicting the most fierce blow since the start of the war. British planes used flares to find their targets and then dropped bombs, which were larger than those previously used, and also dropped high-explosive bombs, which hit their targets. According to one airman, when the British planes flew to Essen, they used flares to see the factory buildings, which stretched for miles. Black smoke billowed from the chimneys, indicating that they were working at full capacity. The bombs dropped by the British planes either hit the machinery directly or were very close to it. Another pilot said that he circled over the factory area for fifteen minutes to find the exact location of the power station, and then dropped bombs, which hit the target and started a fire. British planes that arrived later then bombed the machine shops fiercely, and the fire became very intense. At the same time, Blenheim bombers from the British Island Command flew near Trondheim, Norway, and bombed a German supply ship, which was hit and caught fire. Earlier, Blenheim British bombers patrolled the northern coast of Norway and saw two supply ships marked with the "卍" symbol, each weighing about 2,000 to 3,000 tons, with decks full of cargo. They flew low and bombed and strafed the two ships separately. Two hours later, when the British planes flew back, they still saw one of the two ships on fire, with thick smoke billowing. Soon after, the British planes saw another supply ship near the Norwegian coast, but because they had run out of bombs, they opened fire and strafed the ship, which sped towards the shore to avoid them. (Reuters, 14th)</p>
<p>London - Officials announced that last night, despite extremely unfavorable weather conditions, the British Air Force still launched attacks on several targets inside Germany.

According to the Air Ministry, one British plane was lost in the above raids. (Reuters, 14th)</p>

<p>British Air Force Night Raid on Berlin - Fires in Many Central Areas</p>
<p>London - On Saturday, the British Air Force launched a night raid on Berlin, dropping tons of high-explosive bombs and hundreds of incendiary bombs, and fiercely bombed several military targets in the central district of Berlin. Although the bombing's detailed results could not be clearly seen due to cloud cover, large fires could be seen from far outside the city. According to the Air Ministry's intelligence office, the first batch of attacking British planes arrived in Berlin at nearly 10 p.m. The local artillery, aided by the city's surrounding searchlights, resisted fiercely, but the British were good at using low clouds to fly towards the city center from all directions, found their targets through the gaps in the clouds, and bombed in turn at high and low altitudes. The central power station in the Moabit district was particularly targeted by the British planes, which dropped incendiary bombs and set it on fire. The Berlin dispatch of the Swiss Afton newspaper described the situation in Berlin when the air raid alert was issued on Saturday night, when traffic stopped and entertainment ceased, and people suddenly rushed to take cover, saying that Berlin had been safe for four consecutive nights. On Saturday night, when pedestrians were crowding the streets, the alarm sounded loudly. The underground trains all stopped at the nearest station, and the passengers all got off the train. The train only proceeded after the alarm was lifted. The trams also stopped immediately, and the drivers and conductors, and the passengers hurriedly took refuge in air-raid shelters. The theaters and cinemas stopped showing films, and the audiences went to the cellars for cover. Restaurants also stopped serving meals. (Reuters, 14th)</p>
<p>London - Berlin's main transportation lines were disrupted by the British Air Force's fierce bombing, causing great inconvenience to Berlin residents. Although senior Nazi officials expressed calm and set off for Upper Bavaria for their "autumn vacation," less important Berliners were not encouraged by this. According to recent news from Germany, although Berlin residents recognize air raids as inevitable, they also feel that General Goering's repeated guarantees that foreign planes cannot penetrate German defenses are simply deceptive. A Swedish newspaper recently published a conversation with a Swedish sailor who recently arrived in Sweden from Luleå on a ore carrier. He said, "My impression of Bremen was constant bombing. On the eve of our arrival in Bremen, the port's large warehouse was bombed to the ground. Although the damage to the city was not as great as the bombing of the naval base and its wharves and warehouses in Bremerhaven, it was still a scene of devastation. Every night, the bombing was so intense that it was extremely dangerous. We spent seven days and nights there, and could not sleep peacefully because the air raids lasted for hours." (Reuters, 14th)</p>
<p>German and Dutch Coastal Port Areas Attacked by Air Raids in Storms</p>
<p>London - According to an Air Ministry communiqué, on Friday night, bombers of the Royal Air Force attacked many places in Germany and German-occupied territories in unfavorable weather, with great success. One pilot said, "The weather was impossible. When approaching the Dutch coast, the sky was covered with thick clouds, completely dark, and there was heavy fog and rain. Neither the sea nor the land could be seen. It was also extremely cold in the air, almost freezing, and flying was quite difficult." According to the pilots' reports, although the thick clouds hindered them in many places, the enemy's anti-aircraft guns and searchlights were also hindered. When bombers bombed Wilhelmshaven, the clouds cleared and they saw the target, so they dropped a very large bomb on the port area, and then there was a huge explosion. Other planes continued to drop bombs, and then fires broke out. At the same time, planes attacked Bremen, and explosions occurred repeatedly on the ground in Kiel. When the planes left, three large fires could be seen. The shipyards of Hamburg and the Dutch oil refineries also caught fire due to bomb hits. Several airfields on the six islands of Texel and others on the Dutch and German coasts were also severely damaged. When bombing Texel, a heavy bomber was attacked by two enemy fighters, and one of them was shot down into the sea. A British plane descended to an altitude of 5,000 feet over Den Helder and attacked ships along the docks, causing five large fires. German attacks on British ports such as Antwerp and others were also attacked. The port of Boulogne and Woosdan experienced huge explosions and flames due to bomb hits. (Reuters, 13th)</p>
<p>London - A joint communiqué from the Admiralty and the Air Ministry stated that after Cherbourg was fiercely bombed by British naval heavy warships and the British Air Force on Thursday night, the British immediately sent planes to scout. Although it is impossible to publish all the intelligence obtained, it can be announced that the port's shipping has been greatly reduced, and its shipyards and seaplane base have been damaged. Torpedo boats in the small bay were also damaged. Only a few small boats remained in the Bassin d'Airs, and the dry docks and repair shops in the Bassin Napoléon were also damaged. When the British planes flew to scout, they saw a ship and the entrance to the east side of the inner harbor still burning. The main seaplane base of Zhang Telaian was also hit and severely damaged.

<p>London - Yesterday, tens of thousands of London residents witnessed several attempts by German planes to attack London being repelled in the streets. Spectators saw four or five bombers dodging through the clouds and eventually escaping. A Spitfire British fighter plane swooped down from the west and fiercely attacked nine German fighter-bombers. When the British plane accelerated, the German planes dispersed and quickly fled to the southeast. An Air Ministry communiqué on Sunday's air raid stated that shortly after noon, enemy planes began a series of air raids on southeastern England. The number of planes was small, but later, German planes in batches flew across the Kent coast in succession. Several of them sneaked into the London area and dropped bombs on several places in London and the suburbs. There was no major material damage, and there were some casualties. Several houses in one area were destroyed by bombing, and a fire broke out, which was quickly extinguished. Two places in the suburbs of London were bombed, causing some casualties. The damage suffered in other places was minimal. According to reports received so far, one enemy plane was shot down, and the British also lost one fighter plane, but the pilot was unharmed. (Reuters, 11th)</p>
<p>London - Last night, German planes made their 37th night raid on London, earlier than usual. Not long after the air raid sirens sounded, bombs fell one after another from the moonlit sky. The German planes invaded the skies over London in teams of four or five, taking turns approximately every fifteen minutes. This method was obviously an attempt to defeat the capital's defenses. The German planes were flying so high that the anti-aircraft shells fired upwards and exploding at the German planes' altitude could hardly be seen from the ground. Two bombs fell in one area of London, destroying five houses, and many people were buried in the broken beams, broken rafters, broken tiles, and ruined walls. After the air raid on London began yesterday, German planes were again reported to have flown over Liverpool and a town in the west. The people of London went to the air-raid shelters at dusk, while the sound of distant anti-aircraft guns seemed to warn them that the raiders were coming. On Sunday morning, there were no air raid alerts in the London area. There were only two alerts all day, and the second one was very short. However, during the second air raid, six high-explosive bombs fell in one area of London, four of which landed in open fields, causing no damage. The fifth bomb destroyed a tavern, and the sixth bomb damaged one side of a school building and destroyed another tavern. The two bombs caused more than a dozen deaths and injuries. After Sunday's short air raid, last night until dawn this morning, the German planes again wreaked havoc. Countless houses were destroyed in several areas of London, and in several other areas, incendiary bombs fell like rain. After midnight, 21 areas of London had been bombed, and the German planes were launching intermittent attacks around the city, reportedly breaking into London and unloading their deadly explosives. A house was hit by a bomb, and it is feared that many people were killed under the house. Rescue teams immediately rushed to search. Incendiary bombs caused fires in several places in one area, but the fires were quickly brought under control. Last night's air raid on London was much lighter than the previous few nights, but it was reported that several other places in Britain were also bombed at the same time. It was reported that in a city in southeastern England, a bomb destroyed the mayor's home's basement, and the mayor and his wife are feared to have been killed. Machine gun fire and aircraft engines were heard over eastern Ingria, and it was reported that an air battle had taken place there. Spitfires chased two German planes out to sea. South Wales was also reported to have been attacked. Bombs also fell in the working-class area of a town in northwestern England and a town in southeastern England. During the first air raid yesterday, thousands of people saw German planes repeatedly attempt to break through the defense line and reach central London, but were repelled by British fighters. British fighters chased four or five German planes in the clouds, closely pursuing them until the German planes fled back to their homeland. After a Spitfire swooped down on nine German fighter-bombers from the west and broke through their formation, the German planes scattered to the southeast. The anti-aircraft batteries along the coast of Kent heavily attacked several squadrons of Messerschmitts flying towards London. The German planes were hit and dispersed their formation into several small teams, still pushing towards London. It was not until a squadron of Spitfires rose to meet them that they turned back and fled. (United Press, 10th)</p>
<p>London - Last night, German planes bombed 36 districts of London and more than 20 other places. An apartment in Liverpool was hit by a bomb, causing many deaths and injuries. A monastery was bombed, but fortunately, no one was injured. German planes dropped a new type of "bread basket" bomb in the suburbs of London, which was filled with small high-explosive bombs instead of incendiary bombs. Residents reported that 16 bombs exploded in succession within one minute. The Air Ministry announced that a total of two enemy planes were destroyed yesterday. The British lost two fighter planes, but their pilots had safely escaped. (Reuters, 10th)</p>

The ship was sunk by a torpedo. The Italian torpedo boat was also sunk by enemy fire. Fortunately, all the sailors and crew were rescued by another Italian boat. The battle continued for some time, and two more Italian torpedo boats were sunk. Another torpedo destroyer was hit by enemy fire and could not move.

<p>London - A Reuters correspondent telegraphed from somewhere in England that the newly formed American Eagle Squadron is nearing the end of its training in England and will take to the skies as an elite squadron within the year. The squadron's pilots are quite diverse, including university students, commercial pilots, and professional pilots. Sweeney, who organized the American volunteer group in France during the last war, is also serving as a squadron leader in the Eagle Squadron. According to Sweeney, competition to join the squadron is fierce. Hundreds of American youths have applied to the Montreal recruitment office to join, so there is no shortage of manpower. On average, twenty people are selected each week to come to England for training. (Reuters, 14th)</p>

<h3 id="e50">The Reason for Marital Tragedy - The Spearhead withers on the Wedding Night; - A Wife yearns for rain during a long drought, how can she not resent the endless wait! <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>Affectionate feelings, as sticky as glue and as thick as lacquer, this is the phenomenon that a loving couple should exhibit. Truly, when a robust man with powerful feelings marries a charming girl who is yearning for spring, they will inevitably have affection as deep as the sea, happiness surpassing flying, giving birth to clever children, and organizing a happy family. What happiness this is! Originally, a couple is the combination of male and female love, they should be in harmony with each other, intimately connected, sharing joys and sorrows, with no distinction between you and me. If a couple is not loving, with whom shall they be loving? However, the reality is often not so. Loving couples do exist in this world, but there are also not a few couples who hate each other like enemies. In social news, tragic events such as suicide, murder, elopement, adultery, separation, and divorce are not uncommon.</p>
<p>Why does a lover turn into an enemy? Why does a husband and wife become adversaries? There are various, intricate, and confusing reasons for this. However, the decline of sexual function, leading to the wavering of love, is often the most common cause. To be frank, a couple is the union of sexual relations. If their sex life is fulfilling, then their love will inevitably be strong. If a man has committed self-pleasuring and seminal emission in his early years, or if he has been dissolute and indulged in lust after marriage, or if he has damaged his sexual function due to overwork and anxiety, resulting in seminal leakage, premature ejaculation, impotence, incomplete development of sexual organs, shortness like a finger, neurasthenia, thin sperm, infertility, etc., then there will be no way to have a satisfactory sex life for the couple. Let us put ourselves in her place and think. If the one who is in the inferior position, who is gazing with beautiful eyes and yearning for joy, finds that her partner is completely useless, or even collapses at the first sign of trouble, then everything is over. What a heartbreaking thing this is! If it happens again and again, making her youth wasted, how can she not feel resentment? Therefore, love breaks down, and all kinds of tragedies occur between couples!</p>
<p>The only way for a smart husband to remedy this is to cure the disease from the root. According to world-renowned doctors and my experience, the most effective and appropriate treatment is to take the gonadal hormone preparation "Sheng Zhi Su". This agent is replicated using scientific methods from the gonadal hormones extracted from strong animals such as gorillas and sea dogs. Therefore, it is of pure quality and has a potent medicinal effect. After taking it, it can generate sperm, tonify the kidneys, strengthen the brain, activate blood circulation, and nourish the nerves within one day and night, exerting a great effect. If you continue to take it, you can completely cure the above symptoms in a short period of time, and you can also benefit from longevity, extending your life, and rejuvenating yourself. Only those with seminal emission need to take "Xi Mi Tuo Shi Gu Jing Pian" at the same time to strengthen the seminal gate and prevent leakage, so that both the symptoms and the root cause can be treated, and the effect will be rapid.</p>
<h3 id="e51">Failure to Treat Seminal Emission Can Lead to Premature Aging and Death <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>— Venereal Disease Specialist Zhan Nian-zeng</p>
<p>According to health experts: "A person is originally supposed to live to seventy or eighty years, but they shorten their natural lifespan due to carelessness and illness, and this is their sin!" So, how sinful is it for young people to commit self-pollution and seminal emission? Seminal fluid in the human body is the most precious of all endocrine gland secretions. It functions to regulate metabolism, promote developmental functions, and nourish various nerves. If self-pollution and seminal emission cause excessive loss of seminal fluid in the body, the metabolic rate will decrease, new cells will be lacking in various tissues, and too many old cells will die. This leads to a sallow complexion and emaciated body. Although young in age, one already appears old. Furthermore, due to the weakening of the brain, spinal cord, and sexual nerves, various symptoms such as memory loss, insomnia with excessive dreaming, back pain, kidney deficiency, and scattered energy will follow. Not only that, but failure to treat seminal emission will inevitably lead to depletion of essence and exhaustion of blood. Developmental functions will be inhibited, often resulting in a short stature and small genitals, like a child. Indeed, such a youth, on the verge of death, will not only be unable to concentrate on studies and be incompetent in their profession, but will also be impoverished and accomplish nothing in life. Even in the marital life that is essential for life, they will inevitably fail to fulfill their duties, be hated by their wife, and the family will fall into a miserable hell. With a weak body, and encountering all kinds of stimulation, leading to suicidal depression or succumbing to illness, is also very common!</p>
<p>To seek remedy, self-pollution must be stopped, and seminal emission must be treated as soon as possible. Taking "Hemitol's Semen-Consolidating Pills" can consolidate the seminal gate, calm the nerves, and seminal emission will heal itself. If seminal emission has already caused the above-mentioned symptoms, it is necessary to also take the gonadotropic hormone preparation "Reproductin" to nourish the brain and kidneys, increase essence and blood, nourish the nerves, promote developmental functions, and invigorate metabolism. If continued to be taken, it will definitely be able to completely cure the above symptoms in a short period of time, and can also achieve the effect of prolonging life, rejuvenating, and returning to youth. However, if patients in this city can come to our clinic in person for expert treatment, a cure can be guaranteed.</p>
<p>Beauty and Health</p>
<h3 id="e52">The Latest Method for Developing Breast Size <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>— American Medical Doctor Yao Chongpei</p>
<p>If we want to thoroughly understand the value of female beauty and health, then undoubtedly we only need to first estimate the level of breast development, which is most essential. If a woman's breasts can be higher and more elastic, then not only can they form the most mysterious curves with a graceful waist and plump buttocks, making people intoxicated and admiring, but also their ovarian function must be healthy. The metabolic rate must be vigorous, so their temperament is invariably gentle and docile, their muscles invariably crystal clear and white, and their complexion is invariably ruddy and charming. Not only are they fragrant and envied everywhere, taking up many advantages, but also in the private life within the boudoir, they invariably satisfy their husbands and have infinite happiness!</p>
<p>But having said that. If this kind of happiness is destroyed due to breast binding, self-pollution, or suffering from menstrual irregularities, leucorrhea, anemia, etc., resulting in the destruction of ovarian function and affecting the metabolic rate, leading to breast atrophy and loss of beauty and health, then the god of happiness will not be close to her, and what she encounters is only a bad environment and a tragic fate. The only remedy is to actively take the ovarian preparation for women "Reproductin," which is most suitable and effective. This preparation was invented by the Austrian physiology master Dr. Staner after more than thirty years of arduous experimentation, and has been proven by many famous Chinese and Western doctors to have mild properties and great efficacy. Regardless of various hidden female diseases, they can all be completely cured in the shortest period of time. If continued to be taken consistently, it can not only make atrophied breasts stand tall, but also make the kidneys plump, the muscles smooth, and the cheeks delicate, keeping youth for a long time.</p>

<h3 id="e53">Gandhi Drafts Plan to Fight for Freedom; Prepares for Final Fast; Congress Passes Non-Violent Movement <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>Wardha: Gandhi's civil disobedience plan has been approved today by the All-India National Congress Executive Committee. This plan is a response to the British Empire's failure to meet the Congress's demands for independence. It is understood that only two people will be involved in this plan. It is rumored that Gandhi or Nehru may be arrested for distributing leaflets promoting non-violent civil disobedience. (International News Agency, 14th)</p>
<p>Wardha: The All-India National Congress Party Council issued a statement before adjourning, endorsing Gandhi's proposed individual civil resistance plan. The implementation of this plan will be limited to a small number of people. It is heard that Gandhi proposed that initially only two people would be eligible for arrest, one being the most prominent non-violent passive resister, and the other most likely being Nehru. (Reuters, 14th)</p>
<p>Wardha: The two people Gandhi is preparing to be arrested by the British authorities are Nehru and Vinoba. Vinoba is promoting non-violence in the meeting place every day, and his method of promotion will not be tolerated by the government. It is expected that Vinoba and Nehru will be ordered to speak to the public assembly when necessary, and the German government will arrest them, while Gandhi himself has decided to operate outside of prison, so as to personally guide the passive resistance movement and maintain strict restrictions. (Reuters, 14th)</p>
<p>Delhi: The All-India Hindu Association Council passed a resolution criticizing the attitude of the All-India National Congress Party, saying that the future of India's political liberation depends on the victory of Britain, because the fates of India and Britain are inextricably linked. (Reuters, 14th)</p>
<p>Bugar: Because of the recent two-party meeting between Gandhi and the Viceroy of India, the demands made were extremely moderate, but the Viceroy rejected them. Therefore, at present, the members of the Indian National Party will fight for freedom even at the cost of their lives. (Haitong News Agency, 14th)</p>
<p>Bombay: Gandhi confirmed last night the news that he plans to make a final fast, which is said to be related to the upcoming disobedience movement. This movement is to resist officials who prohibit Gandhi from giving anti-war speeches. Gandhi explained last night that the plan for his fast has not yet been decided. In a letter responding to Baravia, Gandhi only admitted that the news of his fast was "considerably accurate." The letter said, "I have told the Congress Executive Committee and some friends about this idea. I will definitely fast one last time in my life. My fasts are all momentary inspirations. I call them God's gift. The results of the fast are also beautiful. I hope reading this letter should not make you anxious. If God has prepared a fast for me, then the fast will come, and the result will be beautiful. May God's will be done." (United Press, 14th)</p>
<p>Walta: News here last night, Gandhi has selected a worker to lead a movement to resist those who prevent Gandhi from giving anti-war speeches. It is heard that Gandhi originally intended to publish a statement to declare the reasons for his determination to support the authorities and let the conflict happen at this time when Britain is fighting for life and death. It is believed here that the scope of this upcoming movement will be limited, and Gandhi is also prohibited by the Congress from being named to participate. (United Press, 14th)</p>

<h3 id="e54">Paris Under German Occupation <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>Paris, known for its prosperity, has lost its former bustling scene since being occupied by the German army. The situation in the city is desolate, and the number of unemployed residents is countless. Men and women on the hunger line, especially housewives and demobilized soldiers still wearing military uniforms, stand in long lines every day outside food stores and butcher shops, waiting to buy food, and the severity of the food shortage can be imagined. The following is a translation of the recent situation in Paris as recorded by the New York Times:</p>
<p>French Deputy Prime Minister Laval secretly went to Paris from Vichy on August 26. At the Médignon Hotel, he hosted a banquet to entertain senior German military officers to discuss the issue of the French government moving back to Paris. Although the German side expressed its willingness to discuss this matter at length, it also said that in fact there was a major difficulty. If the Pétain government moved back to Paris, the number of officials of all levels who would follow would be around 25,000. In this overstaffed Paris, it would be difficult to accommodate such a large number of people no matter what.</p>
<p>French demobilized soldiers and people who have been affected by the war and have lost their jobs have recently returned to Paris one after another to seek work. Among the 3 million French people in the Paris area, no less than 600,000 are unemployed. Originally, 75% of those working in factories in the suburbs of Paris were munitions workers. Because the munitions factories closed, these workers were all unemployed. Laval's return to Paris in disguise, in addition to discussing with the German side about the Pétain government's return to the capital, will also try to solve this serious unemployment problem with the German military authorities.</p>
<p>A New York Times reporter went to Paris from Vichy in late August and found it difficult to go from Vichy to Paris, waiting for a week before obtaining a pass from the Vichy government. The situation in Paris is very different from the past. A notice was posted at the entrance of the Mauriki Hotel on the Rue de Rivoli, with the words "Paris Garrison Headquarters" on it. The German side does not call Paris a metropolis, but degrades it as a city, which is very striking.</p>
<p>On the way from the suburbs to the city, the swastika flag of the 13th-century Château de Vaux-le-Vicomte flew in the wind, indicating that the German headquarters was stationed there. Along the way, I saw German soldiers coming and going, some walking, some riding motorbikes, and some sitting in cars and transport vehicles. In the ditches on both sides of the road, there were more than a thousand various vehicles that had been damaged, all abandoned by the military and civilians when they fled Paris. On the section of road from Fontainebleau to Paris, which was always busy with traffic, the road is now deserted under the dark twilight. Driving along the avenue, heading straight for the Italian Gate. Driving into Paris on a foggy summer night, I saw a desolate scene and a feeling of dragging mud and water. There were no vehicles on the road. After driving for three or four minutes, I reached the Avenue Raspail. Except for a few people seen at the gatehouses of a few large buildings, everything was lifeless. A coffee shop at the intersection of the Boulevard Montparnasse was still open, and customers were sitting on the steps. Those artists and aspiring artists have not forgotten this lovely place.</p>
<p>Passing through the Boulevard Saint-Germain, crossing the Place de la Concorde, and reaching the Champs-Élysées, I crossed the center of Paris again in a few minutes. The twilight was gradually falling, and looking at the street scene, I knew that it would soon be dark. Two or three beautiful coffee shops on the Champs-Élysées were still open. However, the Fouquet's café, sometimes called the American Club of Paris, was tightly closed. The square, which was usually busy with traffic, the center of transportation, was deserted and empty. The eternal flame next to the tomb of the war dead under the Arc de Triomphe was still burning.</p>
<p>The high-rise buildings and luxurious apartments on the Avenue Foch, which had been empty since July, were unexpectedly bustling at this time. The German army has subtly used these magnificent buildings, and their military vehicles are constantly transporting officers to and from them.</p>
<p>In the early morning, beside the Bois de Boulogne, the German army marched in formation. The sound of their footsteps interrupted the chirping of the birds in the park. A team of young German soldiers in green uniforms stood on the corner, singing military songs loudly. The march and their footsteps formed a harmonious tone. Almost every German troop in the German-occupied area sings this kind of military song. So listening to this march, you will be confused and lost, wondering whether you are really next to the Bois de Boulogne or next to a park in Berlin?</p>
<p>The nearest road to the New Bridge subway station is through a mile-long bridle path in the park, where I encountered a group of German officers riding horses. This scene reminded me of everything I saw in the park in Berlin after the last war. At that time, the German officers riding horses in the park in this semi-communist Berlin city themselves did not feel excited. They were all wearing worn-out military uniforms and riding horses. Now these German officers in Paris are in a very different situation, all wearing brand-new uniforms.</p>
<p>After walking this mile-long lonely road, I reached the subway station. In addition to the subway, which has not been interrupted, Paris has no buses, no taxis, and private cars have also been requisitioned by the government. Everything I see is very different from the past. When I woke up in the morning, all the pleasant atmosphere that Paris used to have had been swept away. Yes, this place is still Paris, and the houses, streets, and some people are still Parisian. But the beauty and gentleness of Paris cannot be found anymore. (To be continued)</p>

In another match, Shanghai played against Jincheng. It was originally scheduled to be played at the Silver Union Ballroom, but it was temporarily changed to the Shanghai Ballroom. Although Jincheng had the Five Tiger Generals playing, due to the loss of home advantage, it was defeated by Shanghai with a score of 13 to 6. Shanghai maintained its winning record. In the four matches tonight, the match between Siming, the champion of the previous session, and Jincheng will be a wonderful performance. The results and schedule are as follows:</p>

<p>The final act of the Charity Challenge Basketball match, the Shanghai vs. Qingdao game at the Paramount, has been scheduled for this Saturday. Ticket prices have been raised to five and ten yuan, setting an unprecedented price record for basketball seating in the Far East. At the same time, special honorary tickets, numbered 1-10, will be sold through an auction. The minimum price for tickets #1-3 is set at 200 national currency each, and for tickets #4-10, the minimum price is 50 national currency each. The auction is scheduled to begin tomorrow afternoon. The auction method involves interested bidders contacting Mr. Yuan Ludeng by phone at 14121 or 10290 between 11:00 AM and 12:30 PM tomorrow (Wednesday) to report the price they are willing to pay for a specific ticket number. Mr. Yuan will personally handle the calls and record the bidder's title, address, and phone number. If no one else competes for a ticket, the bidder will acquire it at their offered price. However, if another benefactor is willing to offer a higher price, Mr. Yuan will contact the initial bidder to inform them that Mr. So-and-so has offered a higher price and inquire if they are willing to increase their bid. This process of notifying and inquiring among the bidders will continue until the winner of the first special honorary ticket is determined. In the case of more than three bidders for the first three tickets, the majority decision will determine the distribution of the second and third tickets. Although the minimum price for tickets #4-10 is fifty yuan, the same auction method will be used to determine the allocation of seats based on the ticket value. If there are more than three bidders for the first three tickets, the majority decision will also grant them priority for tickets from #4 onwards. These ten special tickets will have two copies, a main copy for commemorative purposes and a secondary copy which will serve as admission ticket (also retrievable for saving).</p>

<h3 id="e66">Food: Imported Rice Continues to Arrive Non-Stop, Early Market Rose Briefly on Rumors, New Indica Rice Supply Still Exceeds Demand <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>Since the imported rice market tightened a week ago, with a day's closure in the middle due to the weekend, yesterday saw renewed optimism. In the early morning, rumors of Saigon's closure spread, causing widespread panic buying. No. 2 Saigon rice was the most sought-after, rising sharply by one yuan in an instant. Other varieties followed suit. However, upon learning that the earlier news was inaccurate, speculators quickly tried to sell, causing the market to falter. Subsequently, Shenji announced an agreement to sell 1,000 tons, with 500 tons of No. 1 Saigon at 78.8 yuan and 500 tons of No. 2 at 75.3 yuan, both ready for immediate loading. Additionally, there were two or three inquiries by telegram, and previously arranged batches were expected to arrive today or tomorrow, with smaller batches already arriving continuously. This led to a slight drop in the market by three to five jiao due to wavering confidence. In the afternoon, both buying and selling slowed, and the market remained weak. If large shipments arrive today and tomorrow, prices are expected to fall again.</p>
<p>More imported rice arrived in Shanghai yesterday. The Taikoo Company's Qiongzhou vessel arrived from Hong Kong carrying 1,000 bags and docked at the company's pier on the Bund in the French Concession at around 2 PM yesterday for unloading. Jardine Matheson's Mingsheng vessel also arrived from Hong Kong with 1,500 bags and docked at Roosevelt Pier at 5 PM yesterday for unloading. The Risheng vessel arrived last night, reportedly carrying rice as well, but the exact amount is unknown. Due to the late hour, details will be reported after investigation today. (Zu)</p>
<p>The source of new indica rice, such as Jianyao and Zhong Baige from the lower reaches of the river and from tricycles, is no less than 2,000 bags. Indica rice accounts for two-thirds of this. Therefore, although the sales of new indica rice and Jianyao Zhong Baige are not weak, the supply still exceeds demand, causing prices to fall by about one yuan. New indica rice from Minhang sold for as high as 78.5 yuan, eventually settling at 76 yuan. Zhongguan Jianyao from Qingjiao was at 78 yuan, and Baige from Xitang was at 77 and 76.5 yuan. Taicang Yangjian remained stable, still opening at 70 yuan per original bag. Dujian from Qingjiao was an exception, rising nearly one yuan due to its scarcity and aroma, opening at 72 yuan per original bag, and settling at 67 yuan per dan. Kejian from Wuhu opened at 62.5 to 62 yuan. As for broken rice, the market was already sparse and the prices were falling, so there was no change in the market. Changbang broken rice was at 82-83 yuan to 80 yuan, Sutong broken rice at 76-77 yuan, and Nangang original bag early rice at 82-83 yuan, settling at 72 yuan per dan. Both national and imported glutinous rice had mediocre sales and remained unchanged. Jinli goods opened at around 72 yuan, and Hong Kong goods were at 71 yuan, settling at 68-69 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e67">Chinese Flour Insufficient, Market Remains Firm and Expensive <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>Flour: Yesterday's market was still advantageous, but trading volume was low. This was due to the fact that the supply from Chinese factories was insufficient and returned goods were completely bought up by hoarders, with asking prices reaching over 19 yuan. As a result, transactions were quite quiet. Imported flour's current inventory is depleted, and new shipments are not expected to arrive for another month, making it a case of "distant water cannot quench immediate thirst." Furthermore, Japanese and mainland flour are also lacking in deliveries to the concessions, so sentiment is naturally positive. Yesterday, it was heard that the factory price remained unchanged, and the quantity of shipments was reduced. Retail outlets still lacked supply. The customer price for Chinese flour remained at 18.5 yuan, and the price of Gaopai imported flour rose to 19.5-6 yuan. Muke saw a slight improvement, but the overall situation is that a large shipment of imported flour is expected soon, and the market may have difficulty standing firm.</p>
<p>Wheat: Yesterday's supply was even scarcer as vehicle transport was obstructed, and the amount transported into the concessions was extremely rare. Therefore, asking prices from sellers were quite high. However, Japanese factories limited purchase prices to around 21 yuan, while Chinese factories did not make any formal purchases. There were also no new transactions from the mainland or other regions.</p>
<h3 id="e68">Financial Commentary (Continued) <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>— St. Catherington</p>
<p>— October 12 —</p>
<p>Although Japan currently appears strong on the surface but is weak internally, it still seeks to realize its aggressive ambitions by exploiting opportunities while controlling Vietnam. Former Admiral Takahashi of the Japanese Combined Fleet stated that Japan should not fear US interference and must continue its southward advance. Today is the last opportunity for Japan to progress southward. Japan must place Vietnam and the Dutch East Indies within its sphere of influence to resolve the "China Incident." While a US economic blockade will be detrimental to Japan, it can be offset by the oil, iron, and rubber from the Dutch East Indies and Vietnam. Therefore, Japan's outward display of moderation, calmness, and patience is merely a disguise for its inner anger, impatience, and scheming. Frankly speaking, after controlling Vietnam, Japan will sooner or later seize the Dutch East Indies, which will sooner or later lead to conflict with the United States. A war between Japan and the US will inevitably occur in the Pacific. Once Japan is able to seize the Dutch East Indies, it will no longer fear the economic warfare waged by the UK and the US, as what cannot be obtained from them can be compensated for by Vietnam and the Dutch East Indies. As for Vietnam, it produces 7 million tons of rice annually. Besides rice, its cotton, corn, sesame, soybeans, peanuts, and sugarcane production are also extremely abundant. Even its rubber production reaches 60,000 tons per year. As for underground resources, it produces 2.4 million tons of coal annually, of which 60% is Hongji anthracite. It also produces 34,000 tons of ore, including over 16,000 tons of iron-containing ore, over 2,500 tons of manganese ore, and over 1,600 tons of tin. Japan has consistently run a trade deficit with Vietnam. The Dutch East Indies are even more important to Japan than Vietnam. Among the Dutch East Indies' abundant resources: it produces 1.4 million tons of sugar annually, 180,000 tons of rubber, over 10,000 tons of quinine, and 74 million tons of tin. These account for 30% to 90% of global production. Additionally, it produces 8 million tons of crude oil annually. Therefore, the Dutch East Indies are the best region for obtaining resources and developing markets, both militarily and economically. In fact, Japan will not abandon the Dutch East Indies under any circumstances. Once Japan seizes the Dutch East Indies through cunning or force, the United States will inevitably resort to war to maintain security in the Pacific and protect its economic interests. This possibility will not occur in the distant future, but in the very near future. When that time comes, the Far East war will expand, and only legal tender will be usable. The exchange rate of legal tender will undoubtedly lengthen naturally.</p>
<p>Here, I sincerely advise speculators in the foreign exchange market to stop using their valuable funds for speculation. I dare to say that there is no profit to be made from foreign exchange speculation in the future, and due to the changing situation, it will inevitably lead to losses sooner or later. The recent interest rate cuts by banks have implicitly indicated this trend. To strengthen the security of your funds and increase the accumulation of your funds, the only option is to strengthen the forces of resistance and national reconstruction -- strive to recognize the national savings program, which is not only safe and reliable but also offers generous interest. Compared to speculation in foreign exchange, the resulting benefits are far incomparable due to the difference in labor and leisure, not to mention that speculation is currently more likely to fail. People who are speculating, quickly shift your mindset from seeking speculative profits to seeking legitimate investment profits, and strive to recognize savings in support of national reconstruction!

<h3 id="e69">Finance: Gold Market Short Squeeze Turns Upward in Afternoon <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's spot gold futures market saw a tired trend in the morning session after a bearish dark market. However, the market suddenly rose in the afternoon, driven by the shift from loose to tight in the exchange market and rumors of positive news from abroad, which stirred up sentiment. At one point before the close, it surged to a peak of 5,690 yuan. It was rumored that a securities firm with long positions aggressively added to its holdings, and those who had been short selling for several days were forced to cover due to lack of delivery. However, the closing price settled at 5,658 yuan due to a slight easing in the US exchange rate and continued selling by a money exchange. This was a short squeeze increase of 78 yuan compared to last weekend, with a total trading volume of 4,000 taels. Gold jewelry shops increased prices by 10 yuan, while customs gold and others remained unchanged.</p>
<p>Spot Futures Up 78 Yuan</p>
<p>The market initially opened with a soft sentiment, falling by a small margin of 20 yuan. A money exchange sold 20 taels to a silver firm for 5,550 yuan. Lai Gold Firm subsequently bought, pushing the price up to 5,565 yuan. However, money exchanges and silver firms sold heavily again, causing the price to drop to a low of 5,520 yuan. At that time, limited-price buyers came in, halting the decline. Soon after, two money exchanges competed to cover their shorts, and the spot gold market was also strong. As a result, the closing price recovered to 5,560 yuan. In the afternoon, the market opened up 20 yuan, with a silver firm buying 30 taels from a gold firm for 5,580 yuan. Later, due to selling by a money exchange, the price fell slightly to 5,565 yuan. However, retail investors were quite willing to buy in, driving the price upwards again. When it reached 5,590 yuan, a securities firm suddenly bought in, pushing the price above the 5,600 yuan mark. The securities firm continued to buy aggressively, and silver firms and money exchanges rushed to cover their shorts. At the same time, the exchange market was weak and there were rumors of positive news. Although a money exchange continued to sell from time to time, its positions still felt insufficient. The price soon surged to 5,690 yuan. After that, the number of buyers decreased, and securities firms and retail investors took profits. The closing price fell back to 5,650 yuan. The final closing price was 5,658 yuan, a short squeeze increase of 78 yuan compared to last weekend. The total daily fluctuation was 170 yuan. The selling price of spot gold firms was over ten yuan higher than the spot futures price, while the purchase price was over thirty yuan lower. The current bid price was over fifty yuan lower than the listed gold price. There was little trading activity.</p>
<p>Jewelry Prices Also Increased by 10 Yuan</p>
<p>The price of jewelry in silver shops initially remained unchanged, but at 2:40 PM, it increased by 10 yuan. The price at the Da Tong Hang was changed to 580 yuan, and the price at the Xin Tong Hang was the same. The purchase price was lowered by about 30 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e70">Foreign Exchange Buying Spree Continues <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw HSBC announce rates, with the British and US rates each increasing by 0.125, resulting in 3 shillings 6.875 pence and 5 yuan 6.25 fen, respectively. Other exchange rates also increased across the board. The dark market for British and US exchange rates initially loosened then tightened, following a winding trend. The after-market saw a sudden rise in buying interest from speculators, such as the Guangdong group, due to rumors of positive overseas news. The market tightened to 3 shillings 7.8125 pence and 5 yuan 7.5 fen. However, the closing rate for British gold remained at 3 shillings 7.8125 pence, while the US exchange rate was 5 yuan 7.8125 fen, a tightening of 0.03125 and 0.0625, respectively, compared to last weekend.</p>
<p>The morning began with overseas exchange rates, with British versus US and versus Shanghai staying flat. The US exchange rate was closed. The central rate for each exchange remained unchanged. Banks opened with spot selling prices in the morning, with British gold at 3 shillings 8.28125 pence and the US exchange rate at 5 yuan 8.125 fen, with British flat and US tightening by 0.03125 compared to Saturday. Afterwards, Chinese banks initially sold, and foreign banks with beneficial terms were willing to supply at the opening price, leading the market to loosen and flatten. Chinese banks sold October US exchange rates to a US bank at 5 yuan 8.75 fen. HSBC announced rates, with British and US each increasing by 0.125. The white silver balance tax was unchanged. Afterwards, the market was very quiet, and the trend was stagnant. Speculators bought October and November US exchange rates at 5 yuan 8.4375 fen and 8.75 fen. Later, foreign banks absorbed beneficial spot US exchange rates at 5 yuan 8.4375 fen. Afterwards, there was even less trading activity. Until the close of the morning session, British gold loosened to 3 shillings 8.28125 pence, and the US exchange rate was at 5 yuan 8.4375 fen.</p>
<p>The initial trend of the after-market was still flat. At 2:10 PM, speculators intended to close out October US exchange rates at 5 yuan 8.4375 fen, but were unsuccessful. Soon after, due to certain rumors, the Guangdong group took the lead in covering, and other speculators followed suit. The market suddenly weakened, with the current month US exchange rate opening at 5 yuan 8.125 fen and 7.8125 fen. At 3:30 PM, the spot market also tightened to 3 shillings 7.8125 pence and 5 yuan 7.5 fen. The buying spree finally subsided before the close, and the market slightly recovered. By the evening close, British gold was at 3 shillings 7.8125 pence, and the US exchange rate was at 5 yuan 7.8125 fen. November British gold was at 3 shillings 7.65625 pence, and the US exchange rate was at 5 yuan 7.5 fen.

<h3 id="e72">Securities: Internal Debt Revolves <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>In the securities dark market, yesterday's trend was revolving, with the sentiment of various groups being very slack. This was because various news in the environment was brewing and waiting to change. Yesterday, the volume of buying and selling by various groups was very limited, and the market sentiment was very slack. As soon as there was a slight increase, someone would sell and press it down, and then someone would buy back in, revolving between one and two jiao of the market price from beginning to end. The transactions were nothing more than ins and outs of a small number of people on the table. The total amount of transactions was about 700,000 to 800,000 yuan. The simple table is listed below.</p>
<p>Stock Trading: 100 shares of New Asia Pharmaceutical Factory were traded at a price of 24 yuan and 7.5 fen.</p>
<p>The stock market opened yesterday at the Public Industry Exchange, and the trend was slightly volatile. Initially, the market was pushed downstream due to a large number of short sellers. Subsequently, the prices of other stocks were raised due to continuous purchases of Jardine Matheson shares. The morning session closed with a strong underlying trend. Although there was a strong trend of taking profits in the afternoon, the public's absorption was also good.</p>
<h3 id="e73">Yarn and Cotton: Japanese Factories Reduce Production, Cotton Yarn Surges, Spot Double Horse Raised to 1,250 Yuan in Afternoon <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market, which had been revolving for many days, rose again yesterday. This was because there was still no hope of clearing the source of raw materials, and Japanese factories were significantly reducing production. At the same time, the Guangdong group had an urgent need for 23-count and 10-count coarse yarn. Rumors were rampant in the market, all favorable to bulls. As a result, the buying spree was extremely fierce, and the market price gradually advanced. 20-count Double Horse reappeared at a new peak. Today, there are 1,930 bales of cotton yarn being transported to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>The opening price of the current yarn market rose, inheriting the enthusiastic sentiment from last weekend. The first price for 20-count Double Horse was 1,190 yuan. After a while, it fell to 1,178 yuan. Soon after, it was heard that Japanese yarn had risen sharply, which excited people and a buying spree started suddenly, rising directly to 1,203 yuan. At this time, bulls slightly took profits, and it fell back to 1,197 yuan. After 11:00 AM, the buying voices suddenly vibrated, and the sentiment became strong. There were only buyers, and very few sellers. The market rose again to 1,222 yuan at closing. The half-day transaction statistics were 5,990 bales. The price of 20-count Double Horse rose by 54 yuan. After the closing, it continued to rise. The amounts bought by various groups are listed as follows:</p>
<p>Fellow Traders: 3,770, Hong Kong: 2,220, Total: 5,990</p>
<p>In the afternoon, the yarn market heard of another surge, and the bullish forces were exceptionally active. Because there was talk of another limit-up for Blue Phoenix Brand yarn, there were buying voices throughout the market. 20-count Double Horse reached 1,250 yuan. The situation in the first half of the year seemed to be making a comeback. It is certainly a big jump at present. Whether the future is good or bad, I dare not predict.</p>
<h3 id="e74">Cotton Brought Up Quite a Bit <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>The situation of current cotton turned for the better, due to the jump in the yarn market, which brought up the sentiment of the people. However, the factory's sales are still not smooth, because Japanese factories are reducing production. However, the minds of those holding goods are very active. Today, there are 560 bales of cotton being transported to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Another piece of news: In the foreign cotton market, yesterday was Columbus Day in the New York cotton market, and the entire city suspended trading for one day. The Indian market was also very quiet. It is heard that the forecast is for a rise of more than half a rupee.</p>
<p>The trading of imported cotton in Shanghai has been very firm recently, especially long-fiber cotton. The stock on the market is not abundant, and fellow traders are unwilling to sell, so the price of cotton has been rising, but it has not been possible to obtain huge profits. The minds of all parties are exceptionally active, so it is generally expected that the cotton market will continue to rise.</p>
<h3 id="e75">Piece Goods: Hoarders Active, Selling Offers Rise <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>Domestic Cloth: Yesterday's cloth market surged, because fellow traders and hoarders were enthusiastically speculating. Although actual sales did not show expansion, the buying sentiment was very strong. Selling offers rose uniformly. White goods, fine cloth, and fine twill rose by 0.5 to 1 yuan per bolt, coarse cloth rose by 0.25 to 0.5 yuan, bleached and dyed cloth and flannel rose by 0.5 to 1 yuan, serge, straight tribute, and other fine yarn thread blank cloth rose by 1 to 1.5 yuan. More than 2,000 pieces of various goods were traded in the street. Most of them were sales and purchases by fellow traders. Guangdong and Hong Kong groups traded more than 300 pieces of twill colored cloth and other goods. Yantai groups traded more than 200 pieces of flannel, coarse cloth, and colored twill. Transportation on the Zhejiang Road, Wen Yong, and Furong were not smooth, but because the price of goods rose, they also purchased more than 200 pieces of coarse cloth, colored twill, and other goods for storage and loading.</p>
<p>Eastern Cloth: Yesterday, because yarn and thread were rising, people inside and outside the industry were optimistic about rising prices and buying was vigorous. 12-pound Longtou fine cloth surged by 1.5 yuan per bolt. The high price was over 38 yuan 4 jiao. The closing price was 38 yuan 1 jiao 5 fen. Fine twill also rose by about 1 yuan per bolt. The surge in the Four Gentlemen serge was very intense. The top selling price was over 1 yuan 1 jiao 6 fen 7.5 li per yard. The closing price was 1 yuan 1 jiao 5 fen 7 li 5 hao, a sharp increase of 6 fen 3.75 li per yard compared to last weekend.</p>
<p>Export: 100 pieces of cotton cloth were shipped to Hong Kong today, and 200 pieces were shipped to Tianjin.</p>
<h3 id="e76">Women's Coat Materials Sell Especially Well <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>Mohair, sea tiger velvet, lamb velvet, long-haired velvet, and spiral four velvet, etc., have had a large number of retail and wholesale transactions recently. Women's clothing stores in various places have had strong demand, because actual sales have started with the cold weather, and door-to-door customization is increasing daily. Among them, the transactions of long and short-haired Haibailong velvet have been particularly large. Yesterday, Three Camel Brand long-haired velvet was sold in bulk for 56 yuan per yard, and miscellaneous brands were around 50 yuan. Ordinary short-haired velvet was selling for 46-47 yuan, mohair for 60 yuan, sea tiger velvet for 45-46 yuan, and lamb velvet for 40 yuan. A custom-made women's coat made of long-haired velvet (i.e., Haibailong) now requires 170-180 legal tender. Last year at this time, it was only 110-120 yuan, and the year before last, it was only 70 yuan. It can be seen that the price of clothing has risen sharply.</p>
<h3 id="e77">Miscellaneous Grains: Soybean Market Flat <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>In the recent soybean market, because the export route is not connected, the sales in the street are affected by hawkers and merchants transporting new beans from nearby villages directly to bean curd shops, so the overall situation is hindered and the underlying trend is flat. However, the price of oil has not dropped significantly, and transportation is difficult and the cost is high, resulting in the trend of small price increases. Yesterday, 150 bags of Qingdao beans were traded at a price of 36 yuan, 30 bags of Taicang beans at 33 yuan, 50 bags of Dachang beans at 32 yuan, 30 bags of Beixinjing beans at 33 yuan 1 jiao, and 300 bags of Tianjin beans on the road at 44 yuan 5 jiao, it is said.</p>
<p>Yesterday (14th), 2,250 tins of raw oil and 1,570 tins of soybean oil were shipped from Qingdao.</p>
<h3 id="e78">Sugar Market: Sugar Prices Fluctuate <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, sugar prices fluctuated, but the trend was still stable. The association's board set the prices for spot goods, with 24 coarse white foreign warehouse goods at 74 yuan 9 jiao, up 1 jiao, transit goods at 58 yuan 5 jiao, down 0.5 jiao, Dutch cotton white at 72 yuan 4 jiao, Dutch red continuing to rise 7 jiao to 57 yuan, Taikoo car white B mark at 72 yuan 7 jiao, up 2 jiao, DY mark at 70 yuan, down 0.4 jiao, HX mark at 69 yuan 2 jiao, down 0.6 jiao, and H mark car red at 56 yuan 7 jiao.</p>
<h3 id="e79">Northern and Southern Goods: Black Dates Up More Than 20 Yuan <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>Since the introduction of new black dates, the initial price was quite flat. However, due to exchange rate relations, the cost has increased, so the asking price has continued to rise. Yesterday, a small number opened, and Gaozhuang reached as high as 96 yuan, rising by more than 20 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e80">Coal: Bituminous Coal Supply and Demand in Equilibrium <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>Recently, the coal market has seen prices rise since the interruption of Hongji coal supplies. However, due to ample existing stocks of bituminous coal, and with various factories cautiously making purchases, the supply and demand remain relatively balanced, and there have been no significant fluctuations in sales prices. Yesterday's prices were: Indian bituminous coal at $205 per ton, lump coal at $210 per ton. The above prices are after trade discounts, ex-warehouse, with lighterage and cartage at the buyer's expense. Door-to-door deliveries are subject to additional charges.</p>
<h3 id="e81">Metals: Straits Tin - Scarce Goods, Firm Prices <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>The Straits tin market, which had been quiet for some time, is currently facing a situation where no new shipments are arriving from overseas, and the existing stocks in Shanghai are low. Market sentiment is positive, and prices remain firm. Historically, the primary use for this tin has been for rollers in cotton mills. However, with many cotton mills relocating, business has declined. Even those that have not relocated are unable to procure the tin due to the high prices. Furthermore, lock factories and machine factories are also refraining from purchasing due to the high cost. Current market transactions are limited to small-scale transactions by a few hardware stores. The current prices are $1,000 for 24-gauge tin and $500 for 26-gauge tin.</p>
<h3 id="e82">Aniseed Tightening <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>Aniseed is experiencing a persistent shortage of arrivals, leading to dwindling stocks in the market. Asking prices continue to rise. The previous market price was $250, but it has now risen to $260. Some are even asking for $300, indicating that the tight supply situation has not eased.</p>

<p>The Post-War Chinese Silk Industry (Continued from the 12th) by Shi Xiang</p>
<p>If one has a hundred dan of dry cocoons, calculated at 380 catties per dan for silk reeling, one can produce 31 dan of silk, resulting in a loss of $970 per dan. Thus, the spring season's operations would incur a loss of over $30,000. If the raw materials collected could produce 80 dan of silk, the loss would reach $78,000. According to current estimates, small silk factories in Wuxi are fortunate if their losses are only between $30,000 and $50,000. The outcome for those with outstanding debts is even more uncertain.</p>
<p>(C) Various Difficulties</p>
<p>While exporting new silk faces difficulties, most silk workers have no choice but to seek ways to make a living. At the same time, transportation companies specializing in shipping silk for manufacturers are also seeking solutions. As a result, they pay $300 to obtain a transportation permit. With this, a few batches of new silk can be shipped to Shanghai, but most of the silk stored inland cannot be shipped as desired, as everyone wants to wait for an opportunity to ship it. However, in the past month, permits have disappeared, and no one has been able to obtain them. Therefore, the silk market in Shanghai has been quiet recently. Looking back at the silk factories in Shanghai, since the outbreak of the war in eastern Zhejiang, the ports have been blocked, and not a single cocoon can be transported to Shanghai. Only five or six factories are operating, and their remaining raw materials are only sufficient to reel until the end of March. The decline of the Chinese silk industry is inevitable.</p>
<p>Small factories are constantly facing their demise, and the 12% construction special tax is adding insult to injury. If the price is assessed at $4,000, each dan would be subject to a tax of $480. Subsequently, silk merchants from various regions expressed their distress, so the tax for the spring season this year was temporarily set at $110 per dan. Whether the tax will be increased in the future is reportedly not yet concretely decided. (The End)</p>

<h3 id="e83">Amidst Rumors of Two American Liners Arriving, American Nationals in Shanghai Prepare; Most Believe Situation Growing Serious; Consulate Ordered to Handle Necessary Procedures <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>American nationals in this port are eagerly anticipating the news of the Washington and Manhattan liners being dispatched to the Far East to evacuate American citizens. The majority here believe that the US government's dispatch of these two liners indicates that the Far Eastern situation is more serious than previously imagined. During the weekend investigation by reporters, some Americans believed that war between the US and Japan was unlikely in the Far East, and therefore adopted a wait-and-see attitude towards the State Department's recommendation that "non-essential" Americans leave the Far East. However, since the news was released that the two liners had been ordered to leave New York on the 12th to come to Shanghai, American nationals here have begun to prepare for evacuation, packing their belongings and sending their wives and children back home first. Male employees of major American commercial firms, however, have expressed their determination to stay in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Two Large Liners, Richly Equipped</p>
<p>Yesterday's report in this newspaper, citing a Washington dispatch, stated that the US government had dispatched the two giant liners, the Washington and Manhattan, to various locations in the Far East to transport American nationals back home. These two giant liners belong to the United States Lines and are represented by the American President Lines in this city, operating on the Atlantic route, namely from New York to Naples (Italy) and Genoa. They have a gross tonnage of 40,000 tons, a net tonnage of 24,289 tons, a length of 705 feet, and a width of 86 feet, which is more than 20% larger than the American mail steamer President Coolidge, which operates on the Pacific route. They are similar to the Empress of Britain, a giant liner of the World Class of the British Changxing Company (visiting Shanghai once a year, but not entering the Huangpu River, anchoring outside the Wusong Estuary). The two giant liners are sister ships with the same tonnage and hull. Passenger accommodations are divided into different classes. The Manhattan has 69 first-class, 98 second-class, 24 third-class, and 26 fourth-class seats. The Washington has 69 first-class (same), 98 second-class (same), 19 third-class (5 fewer), and 25 fourth-class seats (1 fewer). The internal facilities are roughly the same, including restaurants, smoking rooms, swimming pools, deck tennis courts, elevators, and in-room bathrooms. Everything is available and extremely luxurious, equivalent to a palace on the sea. According to the American President Lines, they have not yet received a cable from the head office regarding the two giant liners operating in the Far East to transport the nationals back. It is expected that due to the government requisition, there is no news temporarily. The news must be made official after the departure of the two liners.</p>
<p>Reserved Berths Not Yet Crowded</p>
<p>However, some American nationals went to the company yesterday to inquire and planned to reserve cabin space on the two giant liners. The company was unable to process the procedures because it has not received notice from the head office, and politely declined. According to the Acting American Consul General, Mr. Blodgett, some of the notices issued to American nationals have been answered, but the applications for booking berths and preparing to evacuate are not yet crowded. The president of the American Chamber of Commerce in this port, Mr. Smith, told reporters that the American Chamber of Commerce has not made any decisions on this matter, and believes that the handling of this matter by the American Consulate General is very satisfactory to the general public. According to Mr. Fanklin, an American lawyer and former Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, "I still do not understand why my family should not stay here with me."</p>
<p>Ambassador's Family Returning Home on Scheduled Route</p>
<p>Reuters reported from Peiping on the 14th that the families of the guards of the American Embassy, ​​a total of dozens of women and children, are packing their luggage and leaving Peiping under the order of the US Navy. There are currently 540 American nationals in Peiping, of whom 70 have requested to leave Peiping as soon as possible, and another 100 want to leave the country when the situation deteriorates. The rest are unwilling to leave unless the situation becomes extremely serious. Mrs. Johnson, the wife of the American Ambassador, and her two children, as well as some family members of the American Embassy staff, are scheduled to depart from Shanghai on the President Coolidge on November 7.</p>
<p>Most American Nationals Prepare to Leave</p>
<p>The English-language Da Mei Evening News stated that American nationals in this city (14th) are speculating on the news that the United States has dispatched the Washington and Manhattan liners to evacuate Americans from the Far East. Many Americans believe that the US government's dispatch of these two liners shows that the situation in the Far East is far more serious than previously thought. According to the investigation conducted by reporters at the end of the week, most American nationals in Shanghai are packing their luggage and preparing to leave the country. However, there are also many American nationals who believe that "no changes will occur."</p>
<h3 id="e84">US Flagship Augusta Reportedly to Leave Shanghai Tomorrow; US Reservists in Shanghai to Depart This Week; 21 Will Board Flagship for Duty <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>The English-language Da Mei Evening News reported that, according to sources in this city this morning (14th), the flagship Augusta of the US Asiatic Fleet is expected to leave Shanghai on Wednesday (i.e., tomorrow), destination unknown. When reporters asked US naval officers on the Augusta about this, they neither confirmed nor denied it.</p>
<p>Shanghai Reservists Boarding Ship for Duty</p>
<p>American naval reservists in Shanghai are expected to board the Augusta this week. It is reported that of the 60 American naval reservists in this city, about 21 will definitely serve on the flagship. The rest will soon return to the United States to take up shore duties. Last night (13th), the American Naval Reserve in this city held its last dinner at the American Fleet Reserve Club.</p>
<p>Liner Waiters Called Up</p>
<p>It is also reported that several waiters on the American mail steamer Cafeir President, which berthed in Shanghai yesterday, will leave the ship upon arrival in Manila to join the US Fleet for duty, as they are all members of the US Naval Reserve and have received orders to be transferred to the US Navy.</p>
<p>Consulate Continues to Issue Notices</p>
<p>As far as the entire American community is concerned, the agitation initially caused by the US State Department's recommendation that "non-essential" Americans leave the Far East has now largely dissipated. The US Consulate has been sending notices urging evacuation to registered Americans in the city over the past two days. According to a written statement from the US Consulate, the Consulate will send these notices to all registered Americans and will also send these notices to unregistered Americans.</p>
<p>Form Attached to Survey Numbers</p>
<p>The notice contains the announcement issued by the US State Department last week, advising Americans to return home. The notice includes a form for Americans to fill out the number of people in their family, so that the shipping company can process the information easily. It was reported from Shanghai today that employees of Texaco Oil Company in North China have received notices to return home, while employees of Mobil Oil, Citibank, and Texaco Oil in this city received similar notices to evacuate the Far East last week.</p>
<h3 id="e85">Preparations Actively Underway for Reopening of Yunnan-Burma Road and Resumption of Joint Transportation; Shipping Companies Increase Shipments to Handle Cargo; French Ships Arrive in Shanghai Daily and Head Directly to Haiphong <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>With the Yunnan-Burma Road scheduled to reopen on the 18th (Friday), foreign firms in this port are actively preparing to transport goods via this route. According to news from foreign import and export firms, American, British, French, and other merchants in Shanghai, now that the transportation route has been restored, are placing large orders with the Chinese interior for various important metal raw materials such as tungsten, tin, aluminum, and tung oil, which will be exported via the Yunnan-Burma Road. As for the tungsten ore purchased by the US government from China, more than 15,000 tons have been concentrated in Kunming, waiting for an opportunity to be loaded and exported.</p>
<p>Inland Transportation Route</p>
<p>There are no regular ships between Shanghai and Yangon. Irregular ships occasionally make direct voyages. Normally, most goods are transshipped via Singapore. Because the Yunnan-Burma Road is opening on the 18th, British and American shipping companies have decided to increase ships operating between Shanghai, Hong Kong, and Yangon. If necessary, a new direct route between Shanghai and Yangon may be opened. In the future, goods from Shanghai to Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou provinces will be transported to Yangon, and then transferred to the southwest and northwest provinces via the Yunnan-Burma Highway. However, the transportation costs will be slightly higher than transferring via the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway or the Zhejiang-Wenzhou-Ningbo route.</p>
<p>Preparing for Domestic Sales</p>
<p>The goods produced by factories in Shanghai are mainly sold to the southwest and northwest provinces. Since the Yunnan-Burma Road was temporarily closed, it has been impossible to import goods into the interior, resulting in accumulated inventory and falling prices, with virtually no sales. Since hearing that the Yunnan-Burma Road is reopening, all industries have been greatly encouraged and believe that goods can be imported via the Yunnan-Burma Road, and Shanghai's industry and commerce will be able to recover. This is what Shanghai's industry and commerce sectors have been looking forward to. It is reported that specialists have been dispatched to Yangon to discuss matters related to joint transportation between Shanghai, Sichuan, Guizhou, and Yunnan.</p>
<p>Direct Connection to Shanghai-Haiphong</p>
<p>At a time when British ships have suspended service to ports in Vietnam, French ships are still operating between Shanghai and Haiphong without interruption. It is understood that several French ships will operate between Haiphong and Saigon in the near future. On the 20th of this month, the Ross ship will depart directly from Shanghai to Haiphong. The ship is scheduled to arrive on the 18th and will berth at the Suntai Wharf in Hongkou. The second ship, the Yarrow, will also arrive on the 18th and depart on the 23rd. These two ships will arrive on the same day, carrying 7,500 tons, or 80,000 bags, of imported rice from Saigon. As for the Kindia ship, it will arrive in Shanghai on the 25th, berth at the Huacheng Wharf, and depart directly from Shanghai to Haiphong and Saigon on the 27th, also carrying cargo. In addition, a large Datnan mail ship will also arrive here at the end of this month. All of the above-mentioned ships are managed by the French Post Office Company at No. 9, the Bund, in the French Concession. In the future, goods and tribute rice from Saigon and other places can be transported to Shanghai by French mail ships without any doubt. As for when British ships will resume service, it remains to be decided by the British Admiralty.</p>

Therefore, the strike is expected to be settled soon, and the public will soon see all trams and buses resume operation in the French Concession.</p>

<p>The foreign-owned Asiatic Petroleum Company, Standard-Vacuum Oil Company, and Texaco, the three major oil companies, used to hold a dominant position in China's oil industry. Since the outbreak of the war, their operational scope has been forced to shrink. Recently, the Japanese side has further restricted the issuance of oil transport permits to these three companies, making it extremely difficult for them to transport oil to the occupied areas of Central China for sale. They can only hand over the oil to Japanese merchants for transshipment. In fact, the oil industry in Central China has become a monopoly. Previously, the three companies could obtain oil transport permits from the Japanese Oil Merchants Association when transporting oil to the occupied areas of Central China, but now this is no longer possible. It is said that the only oil merchant who can currently obtain oil transport permits is the Chusan Company, which is run by a Japanese.</p>

<h3 id="e90">In Memory of the Austrian Psychiatrist Professor Wagner-Jauregg (1) - The Overcomer of General Paralysis of the Insane <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>— Written by Hanfen — Translated by Xia Chu</p>
<p>Julius Wagner-Jauregg, the director of the Vienna Psychiatric Hospital, recently passed away in Austria. Previously, our government had requested Wagner-Jauregg to send someone to China to guide psychiatric medical affairs. He then sent his outstanding student, Dr. Fanny G. Haipern, to China in 1933 to serve. Wagner-Jauregg was extremely concerned about the progress of psychiatry in China and provided appropriate guidance on various pathologies. He was particularly interested in the thyroid goiter commonly seen in western China. The brain charts currently used in our country's medical schools are also taken from the Vienna Psychiatric Hospital. After Wagner-Jauregg's death, medical circles around the world expressed their condolences for this most contributing medical figure. Dr. Hanfen is currently a professor of psychiatry at the St. John's University Medical School in Shanghai and a neurologist at the Red Cross Neurological Clinic at 1771 Yu Yuan Road. Recently, at the urging of friends in the medical community, she wrote an article in memory of her teacher. With Dr. Hanfen's permission, we are translating and publishing this article in our newspaper for the benefit of the nation.</p>
<p>Professor Wagner-Jauregg was the inventor of malaria therapy for the treatment of general paralysis of the insane, and also the winner of the 1928 Nobel Prize. Now he has passed away at the age of eighty-three. When the news came, not only the medical community mourned him, but also the general public, as long as they cared about these warriors fighting against the god of death, all felt regret.</p>
<p>From 1924 to 1933, I had the honor of being taught by this master of psychiatry at the University of Vienna and studying with him. As the old saying goes, "Only a good person can be a good doctor." This is undoubtedly true for Professor Wagner-Jauregg. All those who had a private relationship with him, all those who worked with him, now not only feel that they have lost their mentor, but also lost a good friend; although they may be separated from him by vast distances, they are still guided and inspired by him at all times.</p>
<p>He endowed mankind with the ability to eradicate general paralysis, but the impression he gave you was definitely not that of a revolutionary. The wrinkles on his face had become his trademark, his eyes were deep and kind, and year after year you could see him pacing back and forth in the dark Vienna Psychiatric Hospital. He never wore fancy clothes, always wearing a black felt brimmed hat, winter or summer, dressed in black, with an old-fashioned collar turned up and an old-fashioned black tie—everyone in the streets of Vienna knew him like that.</p>
<p>He was a true doctor, he loved nature, he observed nature, and he knew how to draw practical conclusions from observation. What he considered most important was the treatment of disease and the health of patients. These were much more important than interesting experiments or moving hypotheses. Any exaggerated or overly theoretical scientific work had no connection with him, but he was tolerant and treated everything with kindness and sympathy. (To be continued)</p>

The following was then discussed: (1) It was decided to continue with another phase from November 1 until the remaining rice is sold out, and (2) the target for this round of donations is 600,000 yuan to cover losses from sales at stabilized prices. Since only half of this amount has been collected, efforts should be made to solicit donations from all industries and sectors to meet the target. At the same time, the Deputy Secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Council, Mr. Hederque, wrote to the committee expressing the Council's willingness to assist with stabilizing rice prices and to solicit donations from Chinese and foreign individuals.

<p>Recently, a Polish merchant arrived here from Lodz, Poland, and spoke about an order recently issued by Greiser, the administrative head of Warsaw, stating that all private property confiscated in the area would be managed by German officials. This Greiser had served as the mayor of the Free City of Danzig. After Poland was occupied by Germany, he was assigned to be the head of Warsaw, and his first "order" concerned the confiscation of private property of Poles and Jews in the area. In Lodz, Poland's second largest city, the German head has also officially established an organization to manage Aryan property.

<p>According to the *Shanghai Times*, around 4:30 PM yesterday (the 13th), a great disturbance arose near the Beijing Road dock on the Bund.

Part of the bow of the ship was embedded in the dock. It is heard that the ship suffered significant damage, but the pontoon dock has been damaged and will require two weeks of repairs before it can be used to moor ships. The Water Police stated yesterday that the reason for the accident by the Shunfeng Maru is inexplicable, as the ship was heading to the third pontoon dock downstream on the Bund to moor.</p>

<p>The strike by silk mercerizing and dyeing factories in Shanghai was resolved by the French Concession Political Affairs Department, which convened representatives of labor and management at the Machine Dyeing and Weaving Industry Association the other day. Nine preliminary conditions were signed on the spot, and the labor representatives agreed that all workers would first resume work the next day (the 11th). The remaining unresolved items were also decided to be negotiated again after resuming work. However, some short-term workers believed that the working period had not been agreed upon and expressed strong dissatisfaction. They went out and strongly prevented the resumption of work. After direct talks between labor and management, it was agreed that if any further attempts were made to prevent the resumption of work, the factories could request the police authorities to send police to protect them. Therefore, several factories have resumed work within the day. Continued negotiations will be held on the 17th of this month.</p>

<p>The British-owned China General Omnibus Company in Shanghai has recently ordered new double-decker buses from the United Kingdom due to the development of its business. Several buses have been loaded onto ships and transported to Shanghai, joining the operations on routes 1, 4, and 14. The appearance of these new buses is generally similar to the existing ones, but the rear windows are square. The mechanical structure is also very sophisticated. As for the recent rumors in Shanghai that public bus fares will be increased, a reporter from the Datong News Agency learned from relevant sources that the company is not currently preparing to increase fares. Moreover, the price increase of passenger tickets must be reviewed and approved by the Municipal Council, and the Council has not heard of such a proposal.</p>

<p>Zhang Shixin, a Wuxi native, founded the Jingyong Machinery Nail Manufacturing Joint Stock Company on Longfu Lane, North Zhejiang Road, several years ago. He raised a total of 20,000 yuan in capital. Zhang is a major shareholder, having paid up 5,500 yuan of capital, accounting for one-fourth of the total capital. Therefore, the board of directors organized by the shareholders elected Zhang as the company's manager and elected shareholder Zhu Ruilin as the company's chairman. After Zhang took office as manager, he</p>

On April 23 of this year, Zhang was imprisoned by the police. On April 25, Zhu Ruilin and others, in the name of a joint meeting of directors and supervisors, dismissed Zhang from his position as manager and resolved that Zhu Ruilin should serve as manager and Xi Xisheng should serve as assistant manager. Xi Xisheng also took away the company's account books. After Zhang was cleared by the police and allowed to regain his freedom, he felt extremely angry because his managerial powers had been</p>

He recently commissioned lawyers Dan Yuhua and Zhang Bingjun to file a complaint with the Civil Division of the First Special Court, requesting confirmation that all resolutions of the meeting of directors and supervisors convened by the defendants Zhu Ruilin et al. on April 25 of this year were invalid, and requesting an order for the defendants Xi Xisheng et al. to hand over the account books and for the plaintiff to continue to perform his managerial duties.

<p>A merchant named Chen Xisheng believed that speculation was profitable in recent years. On May 6 of this year, he deposited 2,500 yuan in cash with Runheng Company at the Securities Building and entrusted the company's broker, Ding Zhiming, to buy and sell stocks on his behalf. These were not spot transactions, but were calculated based on the difference between the buying and selling prices. On May 13 of this year, Ding Zhiming bought more than a thousand shares of various Huai stocks on Chen's behalf. By May 24, Ding had sold all of the stocks because Chen had not expressed any opinion. As a result, Chen lost 26,352 yuan. Ding then repeatedly requested Chen to pay this amount orally and in writing, but Chen ignored him. Recently, Ding hired lawyer E Sen to file a complaint with the Civil Division of the First Special Court, requesting an order for the defendant Chen Xisheng to repay 26,352.25 yuan in national currency. After the court received the complaint, Judge Mo opened a civil hearing yesterday to summon the defendant Chen Xisheng in person, but Chen</p>
<p>Claimed Illness and Failed to Appear, and commissioned lawyer Tao Wuzhi to appear on his behalf. The plaintiff Ding Zhiming's lawyer, E Sen, often stated to the court that the defendant Chen Xisheng was feigning illness and not appearing. In fact, the defendant had come to the plaintiff's office yesterday to discuss a settlement, but the conditions were not agreed upon, and the discussions broke down. After verifying the statements, the court ordered that the case be rescheduled for trial on the 29th of this month. It is hoped that the two parties, Chen and Ding, can reach a settlement out of court during the rescheduling period. If a settlement is not reached, the defendant will be required to appear in court in person for the next hearing.</p>

<p>Around 2:00 PM yesterday, several Japanese military trucks were traveling through the area near the Qiujiang Wharf on Qiujiang Road. A middle-aged man, approximately forty years old, who looked like a merchant, wearing a long Ishilin cloth gown, Western-style trousers, and leather shoes, was crossing the road when he was suddenly knocked down by a speeding truck. His head was crushed and his brains spilled out, resulting in his immediate death. The scene was horrific.</p>

<p>At 6:30 PM yesterday, Hirano Taoo, a Japanese Navy Lieutenant Commander, who is currently a medical officer in the Naval Landing Force, was traveling in a military vehicle with Naval Lieutenant Commander Yakisai on business when someone suddenly pulled out a handgun at the intersection of Bazhi Road and North Sichuan Road and fired</p>

<p>Xu Caiyun, also known as Meimei, a woman from Pudong, is 22 years old this year. Recently, acting as the legal representative of her young child, Xu Ziwen, she filed a petition with the Civil Mediation Office of the Second Special Court against Xu Yuansheng (resident of No. 14, Gengyu Lane, Bubai Road), requesting payment of 50,000 yuan in support. The petition states, in essence, that in the spring of the 28th year [of the Republic], Ms. Xu met Xiang Han, the son of the defendant, and they fell in love. Xiang Han repeatedly said he had no wife and was willing to marry. Ms. Xu, seeing Xiang Han's sincerity, pledged herself to him. Thus, their love blossomed, although their virtue was compromised. Initially, they met secretly in hotels, then rented a house and lived together. After a sweet honeymoon, she became pregnant. When the time came, Xiang Han, using the name Zhu Desheng, sent her to the Kemei Hospital on Avenue Joffre, where she gave birth to a son. Xiang Han named him Ziwen and doted on him. Unexpectedly, misfortune struck, and Xiang Han suddenly fell seriously ill and died at his old home despite doctors' efforts. Upon hearing the news, Ms. Xu was overcome with grief. Thinking of Xiang Han's misfortune, she found solace in Ziwen. She endured the pain and struggled to raise her infant. Considering that the defendant was a direct blood relative of her and her child, and should bear the responsibility of support, she took Ziwen to request adoption, hoping to avoid destitution and provide for their care. However, on the day they arrived, the defendant refused to see them, leaving Ms. Xu lost and helpless. Forced to hire a lawyer to send a letter, she was also ignored. In this time of high prices, Ms. Xu, a weak woman, has no means to support herself. Bereaved and adrift, her daily life is unsustainable, and she is in a precarious situation. Therefore, she filed this petition, requesting the court to order the defendant to pay 50,000 yuan in support to save their lives. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Shen Youqi convened both parties to the court in the Fourth Civil Division for mediation based on the petition. Only the petitioner appeared in court; the defendant did not appear despite being summoned. The court concluded that the mediation was unsuccessful.</p>

<p>Yesterday afternoon around 1:00 PM, an attempted kidnapping occurred in front of the American School on Avenue Petain in the French Concession. The victim was a young student named Xi Deji. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Returning Late as Usual</p>
<p>Xi Juxing, a comprador at the Shangying Youli Bank from Suzhou, lives in a Western-style house at No. 1131 Avenue Joffre. His son, Deji, is ten years old and studies at the American Elementary School on Avenue Petain. He goes to school early and returns late, and is usually picked up and dropped off by his own car, No. 11590, driven by Zhang Amao, a local driver. Yesterday afternoon around 1:00 PM, Zhang Amao drove the car to the school to pick up the young master for lunch.</p>
<p>Car Accident</p>
<p>Three kidnappers ambushed the car on the roadside, blocking its path. They pulled out guns, shouting loudly. As a result, they kidnapped both the person and the car. When the car reached Route Heig and Route Hongqiao, a cyclist happened to be coming in front, and the car was unable to swerve in time, knocking the cyclist to the ground. Nearby police officers arrived after hearing the news and questioned them. The three kidnappers in the car knew things were going badly, so they abandoned their guns and got out of the car one after another, fleeing towards the Chinese area.</p>
<p>Rescuing the Hostage</p>
<p>At that time, the young hostage in the car reported the kidnapping to the police. After listening, the police immediately gave chase and blew their whistles wildly. Police officers gathered to assist in the encirclement and arrest. As a result, all three kidnappers were captured and taken to the police station for investigation. Meanwhile, the police drove the hostage Xi Deji and the driver Zhang Amao, along with the car, to the Avenue Petain police station, informing the family and sending someone to take them back. The police now believe that the driver Zhang Amao is highly suspicious and has been detained. Detectives have been sent to search his residence.</p>

<p>When you go out at night, you won't forget to bring a coat for your wife, right? It's getting cold!</p>
<p>Towards our suffering compatriots, we shouldn't be stingy with that bit of concern, right? They share our misfortunes, shall we cruelly clench our own little happiness, and let them freeze to death in the future north wind?</p>

<h3 id="e115">I Hate My Family <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>— Ruihua</p>
<p>Friends all say that I am a happy person because I grew up in a wealthy family and live a stable life. However, how can they understand my heart! A surge of anger is rising: silent anger, resentment, revulsion towards everything in the family.</p>
<p>My father is a very easygoing person who lives a leisurely life relying on the property of his ancestors. But his deformed hobby keeps him busy all day long, and he rarely stays at home for a whole day. My mother passed away when I was nine years old, leaving only me behind. I don't know much about the origin of my stepmother, but I only heard that she came from a "business wave" because many people say so.</p>
<p>At first, my stepmother had a very good temper and treated me quite kindly, often taking care of me personally, sometimes even making me forget that there was a dead mother in the underworld. Everyone said this was my good fortune, and I myself thought it was not bad.</p>
<p>However, in less than a year, I finally tasted the stepmother's fist. She revealed her true colors and became very terrible. Not only were her snobbish eyes particularly fierce, but her mouth was also very venomous. In her mind, everyone seemed to have a long, strange, and nice-sounding criticism, scaring relatives from visiting, but she didn't realize it and instead blamed them for being too indifferent.</p>
<p>A year later, she brought in a seven-year-old girl, who became my sister. It was said that she was her relative, but others said she was her biological daughter. Only my stepmother knew this in her heart.</p>
<p>From then on, there was another quarrelsome member in the family. The two of them, working together, could cause a storm over trivial matters, going east to find fault and west to scold, making the family uneasy. My father never said a word. As a result, she became bolder and more shrewish, scolding everyone in the family, and even the servants couldn't stay long. Finally, my grandmother couldn't stand her domineering power and left to live separately with my aunt. Then, my uncles and aunts also moved away. Suddenly, a lively big family became cold and desolate. I also felt bored, so I simply lived in school and rarely went home. Even during vacations, I would stay with my grandmother. Therefore, during those years, I seemed very distant from my stepmother, sister, and father.</p>
<p>The war changed my life again. The headmaster didn't provide accommodation, so I had to return home. At first, I hoped that my stepmother would be gentler and that my sister would be older and no longer find fault. Who knew that the result didn't give me that impression. My father was still out all day, even returning at dawn. My stepmother, in addition to going out often, played mahjong with friends at home all day long, still so snobbish, liking to talk about others, finding fault with people, and scolding. She was still the same as before, and I was disappointed. Although my sister was also studying, her temper was as muddled as my stepmother's. Sometimes, when there were three people missing for a mahjong game, she would throw away her textbooks and sit down to make up the numbers. I was disappointed in her too.</p>
<p>For three years, the whole family was still shrouded in smog and decay. I was always alone at home because I was not as muddled as them. Anger and resentment blazed in my heart. I could only bury myself in hard work, preparing for the day when I could be independent, fly far away, and leave this corrupt family forever.</p>

<p>Chapter Nine: Shocking News</p>
<p>Ni Jinshou continued, "Mr. Hawthorne, there's more. According to Qin Mozhai, the result of Dr. Bai's autopsy is that Wang Lilan died from a stab wound to the heart from a blade, not from a gunshot. Mr. Hawthorne, do you think this is a problem? Hasn't our half-day's work been a waste?"</p>
<p>Upon hearing this, Hawthorne's nerves seemed to undergo a drastic change. He put the receiver down on the telephone and stopped speaking. He remained silent by the phone for two or three seconds, then raised his left hand to look at his watch. Then, a wry smile appeared on his face.</p>
<p>"Baolang, you really have foresight! I can't help but admire you! -- It's already two-thirty."</p>
<p>I felt his words were simply incoherent. Could it be that the stimulus of this news was too drastic, and his iron-willed nerves couldn't withstand it, causing him to lose his composure? Before I could find words of comfort, he suddenly spoke a few more coherent sentences.</p>
<p>"Baolang, I'm going to the police station right away to see the commissioner. You don't need to come with me." He looked at my face and said with a smile, "Don't worry, I won't have a falling out with him. Although I have a gun in my pocket, I won't use it recklessly. You still don't understand me, my nerves are as sound as yours—maybe even more so. The reason I don't want you to come along is that I need you to take on other tasks."</p>
<p>I asked, "Then, what do you want me to do?"</p>
<p>Hawthorne said, "In half an hour, go to Wang Lilan's house and measure Old Mao's shoes first."</p>
<p>I replied, "Okay, that's easy. What else?"</p>
<p>"Secondly, invite that old man Li Zhiban and ask him to keep you company in the downstairs parlor—remember, you must talk to him inside the parlor. There are two more conditions: close the door to the parlor and pull down the yellow curtains on the steel window."</p>

<h3 id="e118">Go Learn from Others <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>— Ren An</p>
<p>The meaning of education is to confirm the path of effort based on experience, and its purpose is to reduce errors and failures. In this regard, history is a mirror for reality, and the biographical articles of so-called successful people tell us the path of effort.</p>
<p>But if we study it from the saying "drawing a tiger and failing to resemble it," then this act of "learning from others" is not a simple matter!</p>
<p>At present, some people think that success or failure has a natural iron law. The manager thinks that it is a matter of course to go from being an apprentice to the current high position, and wants his apprentice to imitate him one by one; the father takes his own transformation from a coppersmith to a wealthy man as a wealth of experience, and wants his college graduate son to stand by the furnace. This is not only that these overly individualistic gentlemen are too stupid, but they are also likely to make young people misunderstand that learning plus effort equals the natural law of success. The current and past realities are different, so how can we come and decide to turn over the old book?</p>
<p>However, I am by no means denying the efforts of the predecessors. But, when we learn from others, we should indeed learn their spirit of effort, but we should also recognize the actual environment in which they are and our own actual environment. In this regard, when we go to learn from others, we should first clearly recognize others.</p>
<p>At the same time, we must understand that the reason why I want to learn from others is not in the pursuit of voices and smiles. There are many gentlemen who think they are smart and go to learn the small actions of other people's homes step by step, like puppets holding tablets on stage, like actors in operas, dressed in formal clothes, looking like emperors. We must know that the success of Tian Xuwo Sheng (Mr. Chen Diexian) is not in voices and smiles. Zhang San and Li Siaosheng have the same face as Mr. Wu Yun Chu, and without effort and struggle, they will not become MSG inventors. Yu Dafu's success is definitely not in romance and drinking. If you only go whoring and drinking, you will only succeed as a prodigal, so how can you be worthy of being called a writer!</p>
<p>Accordingly, when we go to learn from others, we should learn actual effort!</p>
<p>However, there is no perfect person in the world, and we do not necessarily have to accept and learn from the past of others in its entirety. The so-called it is better to have no book than to completely trust the book. The most economical way is to grasp the point that can be learned. In the study of writing and painting, people are generally proud of imitating the style of a certain teacher, but the most successful people are those who integrate various schools, or form their own style. Zheng Banqiao also deliberately imitated at first, but later realized the four words "each person has a body" before he became famous.</p>
<p>Therefore, taking the law from above, and obtaining the middle, this is learning from one school, taking the strengths of each school, and developing each part together. This is not only better than the blue, but also a superior "learning from others" method that can eat and digest.</p>
<h3 id="e119">Crisis of Life (I) <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>Jesus once taught people, "Do not store up treasures for yourselves on earth, where moths and vermin destroy, and where thieves break in and steal. But store up treasures for yourselves in heaven, where moths and vermin do not destroy, and where thieves do not break in and steal. For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also." (Matthew 6:19-21)</p>
<p>If we want to understand this passage of the Bible, we must first know that the two words "treasure" used here are "jewels" in the original Greek. Although money is a treasure, treasures should not be limited to money. Jesus said, "Where your treasure is, there your heart will be also," which shows that Jesus is focused on the human heart, not treasures. We often see that as people's external possessions increase, their inner hearts shrink instead. First, treasures are for people to use, and later people are reduced to slaves of treasures, driven by treasures. The so-called crisis of people is here. Because people's hearts are easily eroded, easily fallen, and easily stolen, now let's talk about these three points separately:</p>
<p>(1) Worm-eaten: The so-called worm-eaten refers to infection. No matter what something is, as long as a worm invades, it will soon multiply into thousands upon thousands, until the thing is hollowed out. The worm that harms personality is sin. At first, it is extremely small. Later, it grows from small to large, from light to heavy, from shallow to deep, endlessly, which can completely eat up a person's personality. Over time, it leads people to the path of destruction. Therefore, we must guard against our hearts from becoming infected, and not let this kind of personality worm invade, causing the danger of being worm-eaten. There are many sins in the world, most of which are for treasures. All theft, embezzlement, plundering, exploitation, robbery, and extortion are due to the treasures. If the rich use their wealth properly for their own sake, and the poor can also use their personality not to covet or covet what belongs to others, then the sins in society can be eliminated a lot.

<h3 id="e120">Historical Dramas of the Ming Dynasty <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>— Zou Xiao</p>
<p>Recently, there are two historical dramas about the Ming Dynasty being performed: one is "Heroes of the Sea Kingdom" by the New Art Drama Society, written by Wei Ruhui; and the other is "The Great Ming Heroes" by the Shanghai Drama Art Society, written by Yu Ling. These two historical dramas each have their own merits.</p>
<p>Wei's work is based on historical facts everywhere, referring to 300 kinds of books. The description is a small booklet, in which the textual research on the characters is very detailed. The bibliography can be seen from the bibliography, which is the characteristic of Ruhui with the textual research habit: Yu's work is mostly not based on historical facts. Except for Liu Bowen and Chang Yuchun, who are historical figures, most of the others, including the heroine Su Jiaojiao, are not historically extant, but they are not completely imagined. Although there is no historical basis, there is a basis in fact. If we look carefully, we can imagine one or two of them. In short, there are such moving things in the world.</p>
<p>But these two historical dramas have made great efforts in terms of structure. Wei's work can be called "The Post-Modern Ge Nenniang," so in the second act, Zheng Hongda mentioned, "When the former Ge Nenniang came, I had a big fight with him." In the fourth act, Ma Yuzi came on stage, and there was another "damn it," which can arouse the audience's interest. The third act also mentions Zhang Huangyan's letter, so it is prepared to lead to the fourth part of the Southern Ming historical drama "Lonely Ape on a Hanging Island." According to the old novel, these are said to be "correspondence" and "foreshadowing." For example, the third act uses two "exchanges" to replace the two days and nights of war: in the fourth act, when Cang'er sees Zheng Jing, he recalls the past, all of which are excellent structures. Yu Ling's works have always been developed in many aspects, and there is not much compact structure, such as "Flowers Splashed with Tears," "Women's Apartment," "Women's Country," "Night Shanghai," etc. This time, it is an exception to have a complete structure. The last act is similar to the Soviet film "Female Warrior."</p>
<p>At the same time, these two scripts both end with victory and optimism, and both try their best to avoid defeatism. Yu's work is based on the early Ming Dynasty, with historical evidence, so it is naturally victorious; Wei's work writes to Zheng Chenggong's revitalization of the righteous army and plans to launch another northern expedition, just like Ouyang's "Liang Hongyu," and in the end, it still gives us great excitement.</p>
<p>After we have seen these two scripts, we should be able to get a lot of undertones from here, right?</p>
<h3 id="e121">Tong Zhiling, About to Return North <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>— Mengyu</p>
<p>Tong Zhiling, who performed in the Golden Theater, is a proud disciple of Hui Sheng and is quite famous in Ping. This is her first time in Shanghai. Because of her beautiful appearance and superb acting skills, she is very popular with the audience and has become a famous actress in the north and south. According to Zhiling, she is originally from Nanchang and was born in Peiping. Her father once served as the principal of the Tianjin Jiangxi School; she has two elder brothers, both of whom are students of Jiang Miaoxiang and are as famous as Zhiling. Zhiling received secondary education, is beautiful and dignified, and has no actress habits. She loved Peking opera since she was a child, and could perform on stage at the age of eleven or twelve. After apprenticing to Hui Sheng, she received the deepest guidance, and she can perform Hui Sheng's plays with his charm, vividly. Her talent is very thick, and her voice is high and bright. She can also perform plays from the Mei and Cheng schools, which is really rare. However, this time in the south, because Li Shengzao often performs the original plays, Zhiling's plays were scheduled earlier, and the audience who arrived late often did not have time to see the whole picture, which inevitably disappointed the beautiful art, and Zhiling was also regretful about it. Now that the term has expired, she is about to return north. Below is a recent photo of her.</p>
<p>Book Circle Biographies</p>
<h3 id="e122">Shen Jian'an and Xu Jixiang <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>— Ye Jiale</p>
<p>The Soviet Union's Hailanpao and Heilongjiang's Aigun are far apart: seeing the ballad singer Shen Jian'an and the storytelling master Xu Jixiang can also be said to be far apart, one is the dumb school's Pearl Pagoda, which is popular in the book circle, and the other is the dumb school's heroic martyrs, which was once very popular. Now I will describe them separately as follows:</p>
<p>"Pearl Pagoda" is the king of small books, which no one can deny, because this book is the most bookish. When it comes to the talents who tell the Pearl Pagoda, they are really endless. But there are very few who can tell it vividly, except for Wei Yuqing, only Shen Jian'an. The old-fashionedness of his speech, the delicacy of his book path, and the dumb but waxy voice are of course his excellent conditions. His good partner Xue Xiaoqing is famous for his exquisite pipa, so when singing and playing, the dumb voice and the pipa are blended together, which makes it even more flavorful. His signature actions, such as Fang Qing seeing the girl, beating the three unfilial, and crying about Chen Cui'e, have long been known.</p>
<p>"Vomiting Blood Four Officials" is Xu Jixiang's nickname. This of course shows that he is physically weak. When it comes to his book art, it is not worth mentioning, his voice is dumb but not sandy, his book path is pure and clear, without any clutter; he does not pay much attention to the role, except for the old brand Hu Dahai, most of the others are perfunctory. Coming up with jokes is his specialty, which is second to none in the storytelling circle. Often when he talks about the highlights, witty remarks are born, lining his funny face, of course, he wins the laughter of the whole hall, so I dare to say boldly that eight or nine tenths of his popularity is obtained from the jokes.</p>
<p>In short, Shen Jian'an and Xu Jixiang are both popular files today, and I don't need to praise them anymore. I hope they will maintain their current position well.</p>
<h3 id="e123">Record of the First Performance by Drama School Students <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>— Prepared by Cheng</p>
<p>The Shanghai Drama School, modeled after the Fu Liancheng Binqingshe and other institutions in Beiping, has invited Guan Hongbin, Ruidebao, and others to teach with utmost care. Although it has only been ten months, the results are already remarkable. To enhance the students' stage experience, more than 40,000 yuan was specially made for costumes and props. Starting from the 12th of this month, they will perform at the Golden Grand Theater for four days. The opening play on the first day, *Quan Guan Ci Fu* (The Official's Grant of Blessings), involved more than one hundred people. The dazzling spectacle was a group play rarely seen on the Shanghai stage in recent years. The complete *Jiulong Bei* (Nine Dragon Cups) and the complete *Si Pan Shan* (Four Plateaus Mountain). In the first, Wang Zhengkun played Huang Santai, while Jing Zhengfei and Liu Zhengkui played Yang Xiangwu and Zhou Yinglong respectively. During the fight scenes, banners fluttered and swords flashed, making for a truly impressive sight. In the second, Guan Zhengming played Si Lang (the Fourth Son), while Gu Zhengqiu and Zhou Zhengwen played the Princess and the Empress Dowager. There were as many as forty Tartars. On the second day, during the matinee performance of *Fugui Changchun* (Wealth and Longevity), the "Pile of Flowers" scene was filled with singing and dancing, creating an exceptionally lively atmosphere. In the complete *Famen Si* (Famen Temple), Zhou Zhengli played Liu Ying, while Sun Zhenglu and Zhang Zhengfang played Yu Jiao and Zhao Lian respectively, both in terms of singing and acting were excellent. In the complete *Tielong Shan* (Iron Dragon Mountain), Wang Zhengkun played Jiang Wei, while Zheng Zhengxue and Liu Zhengyi played Chen Tai before and after, all putting in great effort. The evening performance of *Caiyuan Fusou* (Wealth Gathering) was also a popular opera piece with many auspicious words in the lyrics, performed by over a hundred people, also a large-scale group play; *Jie Jiang Duo Dou* (Intercepting the River to Seize the Dipper) and *Er Jin Gong* (Second Entrance to the Palace), in the first, Yang Zhengshan and Wang Zhengkun played Shangxiang and Zhao Yun, and both were wonderful. In the latter, Xu Zhengjun and Guan Zhengming played Yanzhao and Yang Bo, with equal skill. The closing act, *Ba Wu Hua Dong* (Eight Five Flower Caves), from the starting of the boat to the stopping of the demon, the eight true and false Wu Das, with their curled feet and short steps, were already very funny, and the eight true and false Jin Lians had sweet and tuneful voices, making them very pleasant to listen to. Because the students all strove for excellence, even when playing minor roles, they followed the rules meticulously, without the slightest carelessness. Coupled with the brand-new costumes and the large number of performers, it is no wonder that every performance was sold out.</p>
<p>Tall and strong men, riding white horses, holding double guns, galloping across the vast wilderness, just like sitting quietly in a small movie theater as a child, watching Tom Mix play four movies.</p>
<h3 id="e124">China Travel Troupe to Perform "Demon of Desire" <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>— Haixing</p>
<p>Since the "China Travel Troupe" received assistance from the famous playwright Zhou Yibai, providing the script for *Li Xiangjun*, the relationship between the two parties has been quite harmonious. Mr. Zhou has also written another play, *Hua Mulan* (Mulan), during these three months, which is currently in rehearsal. However, *Haiguo Yingxiong* (Heroes of the Sea) will run until the 17th, and *Hua Mulan* may not be ready to go on stage at that time. It has now been decided to use the famous work *Demon of Desire* from the past as a transitional piece for several days, with the leading role of Hua Yueying played by Sun Jinglu.</p>
<p>Brief News: Today, Mr. Zhu Liping and Ms. Zhang Xiujing held their wedding at the Hongyun Restaurant in the French Concession. Relatives and friends organized a grand charity performance, inviting famous amateur and professional Peking opera performers to contribute to the festivities. (2) Jin Yuqing, the younger brother of Jin Dehe, who is famous in the educational circle, will marry Ms. Qin Huijin at the Datong Restaurant on the 20th, and there will also be rehearsals.</p>
<p>Screen Knight</p>
<h3 id="e125">Tom Mix Dies in Car Accident <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>— Si Hua</p>
<p>The Associated Press of the United States reported from Alison, Arizona, three days ago: The famous screen knight Tom Mix was driving from Tucson to Florence when his car suddenly lost control and overturned in a tragic accident. He was later found by passersby pinned under the damaged car, suffering fatal injuries. Road police were immediately called to the scene and took him to a nearby hospital, but he died without regaining consciousness within a few hours.</p>
<p>Tom Mix was admired by millions of children. His performance as a knight was outstanding, and his chivalry was commendable. During the heyday of Western films, he was indeed an unparalleled screen idol. It is said that Tom accumulated a great fortune, was a shareholder in several film companies, and also personally managed a ranch. This sudden and tragic death was truly unexpected. If we close our eyes, we can still faintly see...</p>
