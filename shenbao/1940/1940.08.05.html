<p>倫敦　英政府今日對日本所提倫敦兩日人被捕之抗議、已予以駁斥、且稱此舉完全爲英「國防」關係之故、英外部已堅決表示、雖日大使要求釋放此兩日人、英國決不放棄其强硬態度、（四日國際社電）</p>
<p>瑞典京城　日政府所提倫敦逮捕日僑二名之抗議書、昨由日大使重光葵交英外相哈里法克斯（四日海通電）</p>
<p>倫敦　日駐英大使昨訪外部時、外相哈里法克斯吿以拘捕日僑係根據外僑法令、爲國家安全而爲之者、絕不可視爲在日英人被捕之報復行爲、日大使當卽表示迅速設明被捕日人未有遠害國家安全的犯罪行爲之希望、（四日路透電）</p>
<p>倫敦　據日人方面昨晚傳出消息、英國拘捕旅英日本殷實商人三名之結果、勢將使日人感到有與德·義成立深切瞭解之必要、同時將使日本急於與蘇聯解決兩國間之糾紛、雖然衆料東北日駐屯軍人勢將反對此舉、並稱、此舉之結果、日海軍或將封鎖香港、當日駐英大使重光葵就此事與英外相哈里法克斯會商之際、倫教日使館亦同時舉行會議、此間雖相信英國曾將每一事通知美國、但盛傳英·美對遠東政策業已成立協定一節、均認爲不足置信、衆信重光曾吿哈里法克斯勛爵、謂此種拘捕實屬「不合時宜」、據傳重光並稱、「英當局此種突然舉動、似並無任何效用」、靈通方面稱、哈里法克斯勛爵曾吿日大使謂、渠同樣希望二國正常關係能予以恢復云、同時、政府對拘捕之事絕對緘默、但稱此舉係保證國家之安全、與東京拘捕英僑之舉並無關係云、衆信日人之被捕、係根據外僑法令、三被捕之人中、祇有二人之名字被公開發表、此二人爲牧原及田邊、田邊爲三井公司之副經理、於兩月前由印度來此、據報吿稱、渠之夫人乃係一英籍婦女云、中立万面人士以爲、東京將要求英政府立卽釋放被拘捕之日人、吾則英·日關係將發生危機（四日合衆社電）</p>
<p>華盛頓　此間政界人士、昨日視星期五日寓英著名日本商人在倫敦被逮事件、乃英國對日政策有生氣之出人意料之表示、政界人士相信、英國當局逮捕日僑、表示英國雖忙於對德作戰、但仍深信本國所有之力量、一般視日僑之被逮、乃英當局報復日當局以間諜罪逮捕寓日英僑之舉而發、此間數方面人士、視英國當局逮捕日僑、爲英國政界之態度之轉强、表示英國已增加能抵禦德國任何可能攻擊之自信心、英國方面、王家空軍轟炸機、炸燬德國工業中心、油站及其他戰略有關各地、使中立觀祭家對英信心增加、一部份人士相信、英國對日態度之轉强、半受美國對日堅決政策之故、（四日合衆社電）</p>
<p>香港　東京訊、關於英國逮捕倫敦三重要日僑一節、此間各報之評論咸謂、英國本意在迫使日本從速釋放因間諜嫌疑被捕之英人、並迫致日本放棄其對軸心國之傾向、報知新聞之評論、態度已異常强硬、督促日政府採取激烈之有效方法、召回日本駐英大使、對英斷絕國交、並希望日政府立卽採取斷絕國交前之必要行動、藉以對英國明白表示態度、中外商業新報稱、吾人無須追究英國逮捕日僑之動機、蓋英方此舉、顯係對日本逮捕有間諜嫌疑之英僑所採取之報復行動、上月三十日英上院開會、外相哈里法克斯答覆質問時、早已提及報復之辦法、且英國外交界、報界亦已提倡逮捕日僑、對日經濟制裁及重開緬甸路綫、以上各節、顯可證明英國之動機、在於報復、日政府應從速公佈逮捕英僑之內慕、藉除英國之誤會云云、朝日新聞系報紙認爲、日政府於縝密調査該案後、卽應採取强硬措置、日日新聞系報紙稱、英國雖逮捕牧原·田邊二人、以爲報復、然日政府逮捕間諜與間諜嫌疑犯、決無不當之處，日本處此情勢之下、最好之方策、惟有以暴行應付暴行、英日關係之惡化、應由英方負責、日政府對英更應採取有效方策、以肅淸外僑在日之間諜網、讀賣新聞亦持相似見解云、（四日電）</p>
<p>東京　日本著名商人在倫敦被捕一事、此閒人十聞之、極爲激動、陸軍省與外務省接獲日本駐英大使館之戰吿、立卽舉行會議、所發表之官報、顯示英·日關係又趨於緊張、並表示日本對此事之堅決態度、衆料日本將向倫敦提出嚴重抗議、日本軍人對此、咸加以密切注意、軍界人士認爲、英國此種措施、日本應以最堅決之態度爲答覆、日本報章咸盛載此事、並要求當局更以强硬之手段、鎭壓國際間諜之活動云、（四日海通社電）</p>
<p>東京　「報知新聞」昨日載稱、英國情報部之遠東分部、亦與日本境內之國際間諜活動有關、日本當局將進行嚴密調査云、（四日海通社電）</p>
<p>倫敦　星期泰晤士報外交訪員述及在日英僑被捕事、謂倫教人士之意、日本受無數德員之有力影響、現圖完全仿效義國在德國對實行閃電攻勢前所取之行逕、當德軍在挪威作戰之際、義國報紙作反協约國運動、遂迫令吾人留艦隊一部分於地中海，故日人之反英行動，意實在至少使吾人之力量，分出若干注意遠東、又謂日本陸軍之一部份、固歡迎與英開戰、而日政府未必亦具此意見、日政府現正忙於對華戰爭、而不遑他顧、再較有理智之日人、無疑的並明瞭德國之權謀、尚含有促成日·美戰爭之企圖、俾美國戰爭資源周濟英國者、將分出較大之部份用於太平洋、同時德國或尚勸誘日本藉口美國禁油出口、而圖佔取荷屬東印度云、（四日路透社電）</p>

<p>社評</p>
<h3>日本與蘇聯</h3>
<p>當今春日本政府由外相有田發布關於荷印問題聲明的時候，曾遭軍人和急進份子的猛烈枰擊，據說所以抨擊的原因，並不盡因那一聲明的過分溫和，而是責難有田的輕率，認爲對於蘇日關係的調節尚無把握，而貿然表示南進決意，實爲一種孟浪的冒險。可見蘇日關係問題，在日本急進份子心目中實佔有非常重要地位；因爲日本發動南進，若不先調整對蘇關係，則日本有陷入三面作戰的危險。一般說來，目前日本的地位，大有類於蘇德協定未締結前的德國；所不同的，只是日本另外更深陷於侵華戰爭當中；唯其如此，所以當其準備發動新的冒險之前，也就不能不深深顧慮來自北亞大陸方面的威脅。而另一方面，也只有當蘇聯和英美之間，對於遠東問題缺乏諒解與協調的期間，纔是日本實際從事南進的良好時機。更從另一方面說來，如果去秋蘇德不侵協定的締結，可以看成歐戰爆發的信號；則假如蘇日之間的關係，他日有新的改進的話，則也大可以看作他是南太平洋風暴爆發的先聲。</p>
<p>日本由松岡洋右所發表的近衛新閣對外政策，昨日本報社評既已加以縝密的剖析；而蘇聯方面亦適於本月一日由聯邦院及民族院，通過莫洛托夫的外交政策報告。兩相對照：日本所表示的雖抽象噯昧，而其逐逐貪慾，顯已暴露無遺；在蘇聯方面所報告的，則堅定而具體，始終保持其中立並鞏固自國內外地位的立塲。松岡的談話、無一語涉及各個列强，而其中「得能造成之友邦予以造成之」一語，無疑乃以蘇聯爲其主要對象之一。在莫洛托夫的報告當中，則更明白顯示着蘇日關係改善的可能，且並承認日方似有改善關係的傾向。兩國締交，有類相攸，苟兩情相悅，輙一拍即合；但今日的蘇日改進關係問題，縱使蘇聯有此表示，日方有此需求，而別有種種其他關聯錯綜雜出其間；吾人雖不能斷言其必無成功之望，但亦決不如已往蘇德締的的顺利迅速。原來蘇日關係有改善可能之說，不始於今日，而始見之於去冬莫洛托夫十月革命紀念節的演辭；八九月來，唯一成就僅止一個經過悠久談判纔成立的哈勒欣河區城劃界協定，此外所存在的仍只是關係改善的「可能」。國際間的重大成就，往往出於世人不識不覺之間；其屢屢喧騰於文告人口，而久久未見實現者，大都具有許多難予克服的困難。莫洛托夫固然暗示着兩國關係增進的可能，同時也未嘗不指斥日本的帝國主義慾望，而對於近衛所標榜的「新體制」及其政治抱負，則更顯示其保留態度。是以蘇聯對中國的友好固無所用其憂疑，那絕非日本的片面相思所能撼搖；即以聯蘇在遠東危局當中的態度言，也絲毫用不着悲觀，因爲主要關鍵還要看此後國際間將如何變化和運用。</p>
<p>一年以來，蘇聯政策確屬着重中立和自保，如果在國際間有所左袒，那也總是向着軸心國而不是民治國。這種現象曾使若干反侵略愛正義的人士爲之扼腕，但在歷史上却自有其由來與因果。從一九一七就存在着反蘇情緒以及近三數年來的綏靖政策，都是促成一年前蘇聯外交路綫轉變的重大因素；這兩種因素一天不消除，必然一天妨碍着蘇聯關於反侵略及安全運動的合作。雖然納粹德國能夠在一反掌之間化反共爲親蘇，而在一些民治國，反蘇傳統反而根深帶固，即在國家重大危難之際，亦復難以消除。蘇聯當然對於其本身的安全，看得比一切都重要，同時也決不願在國際局勢危疑震撼之際徒然形成他國的工具；但在這種夾縫之中，有時也很可能造成黷武國家的機會。反蘇情緒與綏靖政策在歐洲醖釀發展的惡果，已經斷送了捷克波蘭，毀壞了丹挪荷比以至法國；至於今後是否會繼續使惡果擴展。則全視各民治國能吾當機立斷，認淸現實，袪除對蘇的疑雲暗霧和枝節隔閡；能將改善對蘇關係，和援助中國抗戰，同樣的放在第一位土去考慮。在莫洛托夫的報吿當中，關於對英美關係固無令人滿意的表示，但也並未杜絕改善關係的門戶，此一問題此後發展的動力仍舊要着重在民治國方面。最近美國之於遠東，其堅定與積極殆屬空前；而英國方面在日來種種刺激之下，亦已有重新考慮其已往種種措施的模樣；英美如此態度，在正常的理由上，可以成爲改善對蘇關係的基調。但國際現象又往往不向正常方面發展，即如莫洛托夫表示的蘇日關係有改善可能，很可以解釋爲蘇聯表示，改善對英美關係的可能較爲渺遠；然而同時亦必認識明白，即蘇日關係即使改善了，日本因此得了保證無復北顧之憂了，却絕非蘇聯因此而對英美關係有何事實上的惡化，更非蘇聯因此而犧牲對中國的友誼。個中微妙的分寸，祗須洞察蘇聯對於國際任何戰爭，俱以自保與中立國策，便得了然。如此觀察，並非謂蘇日關係必可改善；蓋須知道：（一）日本爲了侵略中國，他所求於蘇聯者，非僅保證沒有北顧之憂，并且求蘇聯停止對華的援助；這是蘇聯所絕不應允，而日本所已絕望的，因此之故，三年來的蘇日關係，未能改進。（二）日本爲了實行南進，他所求於蘇聯者，纔祗是沒有北顧之憂的保證；這大的是蘇聯所將許予考慮的限度吧！</p>

<h3>蘇最高議會通過　立陶宛併入蘇聯　熱烈歡呼聲震動全場　立陶宛議員卽將選舉</h3>
<p>莫斯科蘇聯聯邦院及民族院昨晚舉行第三次聯席會議、經分別換票結果、一致通過立陶宛併入蘇聯聯邦法案、昨晚爲大會第三日、會塲擁擠情形、一如第二日、到者包括科學家•紅軍•工人•外交團•外緒記者等、當斯達林及其同志入塲時、來賓報以熱烈歡呼、</p>
<p>立代總統發表演說</p>
<p>旋立陶宛國會全權代表團入塲、全體復起立歡呼、至此、大會乃開始討論議程第三項、由聯邦院院長安杜耶夫介紹立國總理及代理總統兪斯泰士巴列基西入座、立總理當卽以立國語言發表演說、最後請求蘇聯最高議會、將立陶宛併入蘇聯聯邦、同時一並在歡呼聲中將立陶宛併入蘇聯之宜言遞交主席、繼由立代表團團員貧農彼託洛斯克士、地質學家密基士及齊倍塔斯發表演說、彼等均熱誠請求將立陶宛併入蘇聯、女詩人尼利士並高誦讚揚斯達林之詩文、</p>

<p>科夫諾立陶宛內閣昨決定將其駐美公使柴第加及駐英公使烏巴魯底斯革除國籍、因該兩公使曾譴責立國歸併蘇聯、立內閣並決定將該兩公使之財產沒收、永遠不准返國、（四日合衆電）</p>
<h3>蘇消息報分析　莫洛托夫報告</h3>
<p>莫斯科蘇聯消息報今著評、由述莫洛托夫演詞之重要性、該報云、「自若干擁有巨大殖民地之强國戰敗後、歐洲方面現有擴大之危機、且將易爲世界帝國主義大戰、在此次世界大戰中、蘇聯最高議會巳召集會議三次、人民委會委長及人民外委會委長莫洛托夫發表演說、亦已爲第三次、莫氏報吿充分反映我國之外交政策、並詳細分析國際局勢、然則該項報吿之要點果何在耶、吾人必須承認蘇聯政府首腦每一次之報告、均含有下列三要點、（一）明顯的表現蘇聯這種和平意志、（二）顯示蘇聯之勝利及前進精神、（三）表示對國家安全及邊境神聖保陣之關切、</p>
<p>在第六屆及第七屆大會期中、蘇聯對於維持中立及和平、極感困難、蓋過去四個月歐局形勢有極大之變動也、沉寂甚久之戰局、已因德軍攻勢而開展、同時新的國家被捲入戰禍、無數政府相繼崩潰、至此、歐局乃大爲改觀、在此急轉直下之局勢中、蘇聯船隻、因得力於舵手、仍得依照原來途徑前進、蘇聯民衆亦因此而仍可置身戰局之外、繼續進行和平工作、此點極爲重要、蓋戰事如何及何時結束、此時無人能預料之也、况吾人預料在最近將來戰事必進入更兇惡之階段、蘇聯旣處於此種極緊張之局面下、自不能不進一步鞏固其安全之保障、而保障邊境最重要之工作、厥爲調整蘇聯與鄰邦之關係、關於此種工作、在過去四個月中、已獲極大之成就、蘇聯糾紛之和平解決、卽其一端也、查蘇羅糾紛之發動、實非蘇聯之咎、事後延不解決凡二十二年、迄今始吿解決，</p>
<p>波海國家之發展、亦係極大之成功、同時比布區之交還蘇聯、非特除去歷史上之不公允事實、且已避免邊境上可能之糾紛、査立、愛、拉三國財閥政權、由蘇聯敵人指揮下、企圖有所活動、但該項政權現已被推翻矣、此非僅得力於蘇聯之外交、其主要原因係波海國家及比布區民衆任資本主義壓迫下早已渴望加入蘇聯、俾可獲得解放、夫紅軍（解放者）在比布區受歡迎情形、孰不知之、同時比布區人民雖遭羅馬尼亞當局之迫害、而仍紛紛歸返眞正祖國、此種情形、孰不知之、凡此種種、均可由昨日比布代表在最高議會大會中之演詞加以證實、</p>
<p>蘇聯最高議會大會通過成立莫爾達維聯邦、巳造成歷史新的一頁、試問此種和平解決及規劃邊境之迅速、外交史上是否已有前例、此種成就、祇有蘇維埃社會主義共和邦可獲得之、蓋彼等均追隨列寗—斯達林之賢明國策也、每一個勞動者、均能洞悉並酷愛蘇維埃制度、關於此點、可在波海國家最近事實中加以證明、該三國民衆一致贊助建立蘇維埃政權、若非認識之深、絕不能有如此熱烈及一致之情緒、</p>
<p>蘇聯國力之强盛、非僅由於富藏之豐、蘇聯最重視民力、雖然、蘇聯之强盛已引起若干方面之不滿、而國力之增强、亦必使敵人不安、莫洛託夫在報吿中曾謂、「吾人實施工作、並無需若干不滿於吾人之紳士的合作」、此語極盡諷刺能事、雖然、若輩陰毒人仕僅在談話中發表其不滿情緒、吾人自無庸顧及、但爲「不滿情緒」形成反蘇行動、則情形必大爲不同、關於此方面、莫氏已促使英·美政府注意彼等在比次波海事件中非法行動之責任、查美國最近曾非法扣留蘇聯向波海國家銀行所購之現金、</p>
<p>針對蘇聯之非法行動、此後或將更趨激烈、莫洛託夫在報告已略有申述、例如自伊朗及土耳其飛越巴庫及巴吐密之神秘飛機及芬蘭當局迫害親蘇份子之事實、均顯示反蘇方面陰謀在此惡毒之國際關係中、吾人應加倍準備隨時動員、並監視一切、關於此點、吾人殊有重述斯達林之言云、「吾人應隨時在動員狀態下、並準備對付任何武力進攻、俾敵人之一切狡計均無從實施」、</p>
<p>吾國力强大無敵、此種國力係繫於蘇聯一萬萬九千三百萬人民之精神及政治團結、此種國力係繫於紅軍之無上威力、此種國力係繫於民族賢明領袖斯達林之偉大政策、總之、世界上任何力量、均不能動搖我國、莫洛托夫報吿目克林姆而傳達全世界、以蘇聯之威力及政策告示蘇聯之友人及夫能為力之敵人、（三日塔斯社電）</p>

<h3>歐戰實録（一）　德軍戰略的圖解</h3>
<p>本報前曾將英國前任駐德大使漢德森爵士所著的「使德辱命記」一書，節譯發表，俾讀者得知這次歐戰的背景。這次戰爭快要一週年了，大陸的戰事早巳吿一段落，英德之戰仍是相持不決。我們搜集材料甚富，都是歐美記者作家的實地報吿，現在擇其最精彩者譯出，名曰「歐戰實錄」，逐日在本報發表，茲將目錄披露於後：</p>
<p>（一）德軍戰略的圖解</p>
<p>（二）西歐戰塲的巡視</p>
<p>（三）英空軍戰士的自述</p>
<p>（四）英法聯軍的退却</p>
<p>（五）法國戰敗的原因</p>
<p>（六）希特勒下令總攻的前夕</p>
<p>（七）挪威女文學家翁賽德避難記</p>
<p>這是第一篇，名曰「德軍戰略的圖解」，是美國Look誌的軍事記者利沃那特那森少校Lionard　Nason他是美國著名的軍事問題作家。在上次歐戰時，他會在美軍第七十六野戰砲隊參戰，對於上次歐戰，著述甚富。其原文譯錄於後。</p>
<p>希特勒的機械化部隊在西錢總攻，勢如破竹，舉世爲之驚異。但在熟悉英法聯軍防務實際情形的軍事專家看來，德軍閃電戰術所獲的這種勝利，却也無足爲奇。所可異者，英法聯軍對於這種意料中的戰術，竟一籌莫展到如此地步。</p>
<p>一般作家評論家不加思索，貿然稱讚希特勒是個才的軍略家，並且相驚伯有的傳說德軍有什麽秘密的新兵器，實則都是欺人之談，希特勒這次所用的戰略並未逃出德國歷來戰略家的窠臼，數百來年，這種戰略根本上是一貫的。所不同者，希特勒能够集中利用有史以來最神速的破壞力最犬的武力而已。</p>
<p>英法聯軍在這次歐戰所用的戰略，側重於躱在馬奇諾防錢及沿比利時邊境直達北海的擴充錢之後，採取守勢。比利時與德毘運的邊境一帶也築有堅强的防禦工事，似可高枕無憂。但是法比兩國邊境這　馬奇諾擴充錢僅是一種野戰防禦工事，而非永久性質的防禦工事。這種防禦工事，無非是些碉堡聯以戰壕，並有鐵路軌所築成的戰車防禦錢，全綫則護以鐵絲網障碍物。</p>
<p>這種防綫的弱點在色當東面，就是在馬奇諾主綫與法國擴充綫及比國擴充綫交接處。所以色當的防務極關重要。這處如被突破，馬奇諾主綫的側面便失去據點，德軍便可包抄共後，侵入法境，然後沿着挨納河馬爾納河浩浩蕩蕩直趙巴黎。</p>
<p>色當有亞爾丁森林爲其天然屛障，森林的面積自那穆爾直達盧森堡邊境，山川縱橫，其中並有末斯及塞莫亞兩條大河亘延迎過。這種天險殆有一夫當關萬夫莫過之勢。摩托化部隊在這種嶙石叢林之間作戰旣極棘手，守軍並可資爲掩護，避免空襲。</p>
<p>德軍侵犯荷蘭比利時的時候，　常地形勢者立刻就想到色當的門戶已吾堵塞。中立觀察家都以爲法國軍隊必巳駐守亞爾丁森林地帶，以掩護色當了。詎知四日之後，德軍卽已渡過亞爾丁森林地帶東北面的沃爾德河而佔領色當了，並以一日四十五英里的速度，向前推進。這種速度實爲有史以來所未有。</p>
<p>這可證明·亞爾丁並未駐守，色當並未怖防，馬奇諾防綫勢須在且戰且退之中改弦吏張了。色當陷落的翌日，法軍當局卽宣布放棄陣地戰，改取運動戰。德軍的新式戰車隊便得在曠野之地與聯軍交綏了。這種運動戰，聯軍絕無準備，德軍則巳養精蓄銳舉世莫敵，勝敗之數，業已前定。</p>
<p>各種戰略，要以避實擊虛爲原則，卽在集中優勢的兵力攻擊敵軍最弱的一點。這種戰略大致須把軍隊分成兩大兵團，其一是牽制的兵力，其一是包抄的兵力。牽制的兵力先在敵軍陣前，作進攻模樣。敵軍視綫旣被這種佯攻所吸住，包抄部隊卽迂週敵軍側面，襲擊後方。德國著名的舒利芬計劃SchlieffenPlan就是採用這個原則。</p>
<p>簡單的說，這個計劃規定以五路軍隊進攻法國，第一軍到第五軍，自北至南列成陣綫。第一，第二，兩軍担任包抄，取道比利時抄襲巴黎，同時第三，第四，第五，三軍担任牽制，把拉費爾，勒德爾至凡爾登一綫的法軍膠着。包抄部隊進展到巴黎之後，卽轉而向東，使法軍腹背受敵（參觀第二圖）。</p>
<p>德軍在一九一四年進攻法比時曾採用這個計劉。德軍在開戰之初原有速戰速勝的希望。但　德軍攻到亞眠之後，較預定的時間相差甚遠，軍需接濟又趕不上，德軍參謀長小毛奇乃放棄舒利芬抄襲巴黎約計劃，改取殲滅法軍主力的戰略。德軍包抄部隊遂轉而向東南進攻。</p>
<p>德軍旣開到已黎的東面，法軍窺見敵軍右翼空虛，深知有隙可乘，乃分兵向西北方面包抄德軍右翼。同時巴黎的守軍兼程增援馬爾納河沿岸的牽制部隊　至此，德軍反陷於腹背受敵的窘境，不得不實行總退却。法軍在馬爾納之役，因得轉敗爲勝。（參觀第一圖）</p>
<p>希特勒在這次歐戰所用的戰略也是如此。不過德軍這次却從色當向西突進，把法軍截成爾橛；其一困於馬奇諾防綫，其一截斷在末斯河西岸。這種戰略曾用兩僑包抄部隊，叫做重疊包括。</p>
<p>這稱計劃規定第一，第二兩軍從北面進攻巴黎，第三軍則從東北推進，第四軍則從東面包抄。在比利時方面，德軍以三個軍團的優勢兵力團攻英法孤軍，第四軍則在亞爾丁方面從東面包抄。第五軍則在羅倫方面牽制馬奇諾防綫的守軍</p>
<p>這種重疊包抄戰略的優點，厥在任何一路軍隊被迫退却時，其他軍隊卽可向壓迫退却的敵軍加以襲擊。換句話說，德國五路軍隊都可互相呼應，而以優勢的兵力，隨時隨地壓迫比利時境內的聯軍或法軍的主力。英法聯軍呢，一方面正在竭力抵抗德方第三第五兩軍攻勢的時候，德方第一第二兩軍已在進行迂迴攻勢。聯軍若欲增援側翼，以抵抗這種迂迴攻勢，德方第三第五兩軍又已乘虛而入，這種情勢眞有顧此失彼之勢。</p>
<p>至於德軍在戰術上成功因素，在於利用戰車及保持各軍的聯絡。</p>
<p>以德軍閃電戰發動之前，世間原有兩派軍事學說。英法方面以爲戰車是一種輔助兵器，共主要功效在於輔助步兵。其作戰的方式先以排砲轟擊，然後以步兵進攻，在敵軍退却時始以戰車追擊。在兩軍交綏的初期，戰車常爲預備隊，其速度常爲步兵的速度所控制，在曠野之地每小時的行兩英里德國方面歷年來早以戰車爲主力，步兵却退居輔助的地位了。</p>
<p>這兩派理論誰是誰非，在戰前原難斷定，直至兩軍交綏是非立見，但是聯軍方面已明知鑄成大錯，仍未設法補救。聯軍總司令甘茂林將軍雖立被撤職，但這種失策原非一朝一夕之故，未可歸罪甘茂林一人</p>
<p>在聯軍更換統帥竭力覓取可守的陣地的時候，德軍已按照舒利芬計劃自色當直趨勒德爾，拉翁及拉費爾之綫了。色當被突破四日之後，聯軍防綫的樞紐業已落在德軍掌握。自是厥後，德軍摩托化部隊卽一面推至英吉利海峽，一面佔領巴黎。</p>
<p>德軍谷部隊的聯絡則係利用無綫電。上空的飛機，陸地的戰車和機械化步兵，都具備着無綫電，隨時隨地與司令部互通消息。司令部的軍令和隊長的報吿，都是用無綫電傳達。各軍的進攻膳宿，軍需的接濟，都是用無綫電指揮。行軍神速，仍能秩序井然。包抄部隊二日半飛奔二百英里，何堅弗克？</p>

<h3>商業掛牌改訂的原因</h3>
<p>— 孫禮榆</p>
<p>財政部發令，自八月一日起，改訂中國交通二行的商業掛牌，由七辦士而降為四辦士半；一般不明真相者，以為政府貶低法幣匯價，顯有通貨膨脹的徵象；投機者又借此機會掀風作浪，力扒外匯，於是穩定數週的匯市，又現縮勢；英匯由三辦士八五九三七五緊至二辦士八一二五；美匯也由五元九六八七五縮至五元八一二五。但是實際上中央銀行掛牌仍為一先令二辦士半，證明政府並無貶低幣值的企圖；而商業掛牌的改訂，則為一時的便宜措置，另有原因存在，其重要者，約有下列兩端：</p>
<p>（一）最近政府為籌集建設事業經費，發行二十九年建設金公債，計英金公債條例第三條第三項規定，「以法幣繳購者，得依財政部所定工商匯掛牌價格，折合英金或美金計算。」但依上海黑市匯價而言，法幣每元尚不到四辦士，再除去內地與上海間的匯水百分之三十，則以內地法幣在購買英匯，每元僅得二·七辦士；如政府允許內地人民從前的商業掛牌七辦士計算，繳購金公債；則購買金公債者，每元卽可獲得不當利益四·三辦士；現在正當國家財政支絀之時，決不能縱容人民博以厚利；故特降低商業匯北為四辦士半，藉免虧損。不過即以四辦士半計算，內地人民購買金公債者，每元尚可獲利一·八七辦士；上海人民繳購者，也可得〇·七辨士；以此差額獎勵購買公債，也足使公債的銷售獲得良好的成績。試觀近二日來，投機者努力扒結外匯之際，華商銀行的踴躍供塞，卽可證明各銀行願意以此差額認購金公債的態度。</p>
<p>（二）自由中國商品的出口貨物，凡屬於財政部所指定的桐油·茶葉等十四種者，均須先結外匯；去年七月以前，須依中央銀行掛牌結算，七月以後則依商業掛牌七辨士結算，政府藉此津貼商人，獎勵出口，頗著成效；然而以後黑市匯價又縮，最近的約略穩定於四辨士左右，與中交的商業掛牌相去三辨士；不正當商人因其貨物自上海等地出口，可以較低匯率結價，多得法幣，於是走私之風頗為盛行。例如上海出口的桐油，去年上半期僅為三十七萬六千四百十六元，今年同一時期則增至一千三百二十一萬三千〇三十六元，增加率竟達三十四倍；又如茶葉，去年上半期僅為二百三十六萬七千四百〇五元，而今年則增至二千四百五十一萬二千一百五十元，增加率也達十倍；此三種商品出口的增加，固然尚有其他原因，但其中包含大批定走私的數字，也屬不能否認的事實。現在政府減低商業掛牌匯價至四辨士半，使與黑市相去不遠，則內地各國營出口公司也可以抬商收購貨物的價格，而杜絕走私。所以這次措置，在獎勵出口及防止貨物流入淪陷區的目的上，可以收獲極大的效果。</p>
<p>以上兩點，大概是這次政府減低商業掛牌匯價的理由；不過有人以為此種辦法足以抑制黑市匯價的松勢，而使多頭投機者膽壯氣長；此說似若有理，但是實已蔑視商業掛牌的可變性。這次改訂本屬便宜的措置，假使以後法幣形勢好轉，黑市匯價放長，則商業掛牌也可隨之提高，並無任何阻礙；何況依現在黑市匯價而言，距商業掛牌英匯尚有〇·七辨士之差；更照上海美英匯兌三元六角六分計算，美匯商業掛牌約為七元，與黑市也差一元二角左右，多頭投機者是否願意負擔此種危險，也屬大有問題。且自歐戰擴大以後，匯價殊松，物價暴跌，外國商品的進口日見困難，外匯的實際需要已減低至最少限度，而海外匯款陸續不斷，供給仍極盛旺，匯市走勢，依然趨松；投機者如欲借改訂商業掛牌的事實，掀風作浪，則必將自食其嚴重的後果。</p>
<p>編者附言：改訂商業掛牌的原因，已經孫先生作正確而精深之分析；至其後果，就記者所見，或卽消滅外匯黑市場之先聲，因法定之商業匯率既與黑市場匯率掮近，設財部有意維持黑市場，自較過去輕易，因官定率與市場率發生钜大差額時，事實上，中央銀行只能賣出，無法買進，因為出口匯票自必群趨黑市場，過去中央銀行辦理匯兌申核制之所以失敗，便是這個道理，現在兩者間的差額既狹小，財部如有意弭平黑匯市場時，易於克服此種困難，故投機者如欲藉此以掀風作浪，則誠如孫先生所言，必將自食其嚴重的後果，請細嚼孫先生此文</p>
<p>美蘇世界政策中，遠東和歐洲的地位孰重？</p>
<p>在輕重不同中，經濟界將起何種影響？</p>
<p>關於本問題之答案，收到國際問題專家儲玉坤及艾納兩先生特約稿二件。各方應徵文九十三件。大部份兼答其他各題。就其所用之信封　觀之，職業遍及工商醫教律師乃至電影各界；足見各界政治頭腦之發達與文化水凖之日高，茲擇要發表於後，餘則按各人意見提名略示之。</p>
<p>艾納（特約稿）</p>
<p>先說美國。讓我引一段七月如日合眾社的電訊：「新任海軍部長諾克斯陸軍部長史汀生昨已分別於參院之海軍陸軍委員會中，各敷陳其意見，力言美國此後之新前線在大西洋」。諾克斯又說：「本人因國家前途伏有甚大危機，乃重新考慮本人過去所持對日強硬政策之主張。美國或將被迫於大西洋之威協與太平洋之威協兩者之中，擇一應付，為美國計，或以避免同時造成危險局勢之為愈。」從這兩段話看來，遠東與歐洲地位在美國世界政策中的比重，是顯然可見的。歐洲是資本主義世界的中心，美國是世界資本主義的最後堡壘，美國的對外政策，無疑以對歐的政策為其基調。所以歐戰剛爆發，美國就立即通過了有利於協約國的新中立法；而中國抗戰進行了三年，她一百在某種限度上援助中國，一百卻仍源源以軍需原料賣給日本。固然我們並不否認日美矛盾的無法調和，但她的遠東政策卻無疑是從屬於歐洲政策的。</p>
<p>至於蘇聯，我們也可以說，歐洲的問題比遠東的問題還重要得多。歐洲列強的戰爭與反蘇的觀念，給予蘇聯的威協比日本更嚴重。不過，由於她的政治經濟組織上根本與資本主義國家不同，她的外交政策也與它他的相反，蘇聯整個外交政策的基本原則，是在擁護各國間的和平與友好。這在歐洲和遠東初無二致。在遠東，蘇聯援助中國抗戰的政策，是不變的這跟那有限度地援助中國以對抗日本獨佔中國整個市場的外交政策，有著根本上的差異。蘇聯不需要殖民地或半殖民地，也不需要輸出資本的市場，它的援華政策的目的，是幫助中國擊退侵略，和求得本身的獨立解放，擺脫資本主義世界，加之於她的帝國主義的和金融的羈絆。</p>
<p>儲玉坤（特約稿）</p>
<p>蘇聯地跨歐亞兩洲，在世界政治的舞臺上，實處於極重要的地位；不論對於歐洲或遠東，都有著一種「安定的勢力」。美國在地理上雖位於美洲，與歐洲遠東，均遠隔得洋，但因其國內的繁榮，全賴國外市場，而歐亞兩洲，尤為其利益所在；歐亞一旦發生變化，就要影響到美國利益，所以美國對於歐亞兩洲的政治，都極關心。無論在那一洲，美國利益遭受威協時，美國定必出而干涉，加以維護。要之，美蘇兩國的利益，散佈於歐亞兩洲，反以在歐亞兩洲的國際政治臺上，美蘇是兩個重要的角色。她倆所採取的政策，誰也不能予以忽視的。至於在美蘇兩國的外對政策中，歐洲與遠東的地位孰重？這一個問題，應該分別予以答覆。</p>
<p>先以蘇聯而論，她在歐洲實居於舉足輕重的地位，足以左右歐局的發展，德蘇互不侵犯協定簽字之後，希特勒卽敢出兵波蘭，法國失去了蘇聯的援助卒致失敗，就是一個證明此其一。自歐戰以還，蘇聯的勢力，逐漸擴張，匪特大半個波蘭入了蘇聯的版圖，而且波羅的海沿岸各國亦併入蘇聯了。所以蘇聯西陲，極其鞏固，有備無患；此其二。此次歐戰蘇聯未擲入漩渦，實力保全，而德義與英法作戰，均已精疲力盡，卽使德國再戰勝英國，希特勒對於強大的蘇聯，也不敢輕舉妄動。所以蘇聯在歐洲地位鞏固，有備無患。但在遠東則不然，今後蘇聯的目標，當在東陲而在西邊。</p>
<p>其次是美國，希特勒的勝利，當然是美國的一大威協，但自法國投降乞和之後，英國雖欲負隅抵抗，但已無能為力，縱有美國傾全力相助，亦無濟於事，此其一，美國在歐亞兩洲，純屬經濟利益，不論在歐洲或遠東，其利益倘受威協，必出以自衛行動，原不不分彼此。觀於美國擴充海軍，欲建造所謂「兩洋海軍」，卽可知之，此其二。美國的對歐政策，已有變更，大抵「門羅主義」有復活的可能。最近泛美會議所討論的問題，質言之就是如何　止德國的勢力伸入美洲，此其三。所以由我個人看來，美國既不得志於歐洲，自有集中全力對付遠東的可能，關島設防，不必說，對日禁運鐵片及煤油，更可知美國對遠東的態度，一天強硬一天。聞開行動之期，已不遠了。</p>
<p>無分彼此·待機而動</p>
<p>毛邦次</p>
<p>美蘇在歐亞的利害，實在並無輕重；因為和平是不能分割的。但是他們的政策，「或許依歐亞兩方面的危險性何者嚴重？兩方面的危險性何者緊迫？便決定孰先孰後吧？然而這個先後，只在爆發之初；跟著恐要彼此牽連，同時擴大的吧？唯其如此，經濟界將受何種影響？也就不難想像。不外乎是海戰破壞之國際貿易，國際匯兌市場亦因此混亂；戰爭國加強戰時經濟統制的結果，各地物資的供給和需要也於焉大變。戰事如果拖長，世界的通貨流通量不可避免地膨脹。從而埋伏了戰後幣思潮的趨向。大致是：勝利如歸英美，則戰後世界貨幣不會比今日有何激變。反之，那就說不定。</p>
<p>葉新</p>
<p>蘇俄現正有事歐洲對亞洲所以不致就動，但是蘇間無論如何是不會協調的，日本既不敢向他挑戰，他便樂得暫時保守。</p>
<p>美國處境比較不同，因為英美間有血統上聯擊，有歷史上的感情；英德戰爭的後果，對於他的國運，至為密切。至於在遠東，日本既不也得罪他，他也就不必自尋煩惱。</p>
<p>這是他們的主觀心理，但客觀情勢變化時，自然不許他不作非常措置。但目前尚難斷定。不過有一點可以提請討論的：英德戰爭會不會像中日戰爭一樣？同樣進入僵持不決的階段？如果歐亞戰局都僵化，那末美國可能先把遠東問題解決，以便移首東向而助英制德。蘇聯在歐活動，當以不增大德意妒忌為度，適可而止時，他自然也得來和日本算賬罷？但是他的動作，大概要比美國的出動慘一步吧？</p>
<p>此外有金冬人，盧　文兩先生意見近似。</p>
<p>是之於形的美蘇心理</p>
<p>王蕭</p>
<p>美國之願望維持世界之均勢，並保持其領導地位；蘇聯之願望為全世界社會主義化，並保持其領導地位。</p>
<p>美國之遠東政策亦為維持均勢，故其對中國之援助道義物質均重，此係事實；而對日本則冷淡之，並適應其外交政策。</p>
<p>美國已間接參加歐戰，蘇聯則絕對嚴守中立，並利用此時間以鞏固其國力。</p>
<p>觀於中國海岸線之被完全封鎖，（包括滇緬路……等）蘇聯因西方已較鞏固而可從事援華，中國政府對西北公路之重視與修築，美國因自己備戰急需而減少各種（如最近之油鐵）輸出……則蘇聯對中國經濟影響力之比重會日益增加。</p>
<p>觀於英國，德國及保加利亞，伊朗，阿富汗……等歐洲諸國同蘇聯之商務談判，則蘇聯在歐洲之經濟影響力當日益加強，而美國則能保持南美與北美，但也不能不與蘇聯保持聯系。（最近之商約續訂談判美國為主動）。</p>
<p>李俊範</p>
<p>先言美國之於歐洲之地位，實際上，協約對德作戰，美國雖守中立，而相反的，對協約國不論經濟，戰具皆竭力接濟。無可諱言，故美國可謂居交戰國之一方，其地位當甚明顯。至於遠東，則彼尋侵略者誠足制止，蓋日本之經濟端賴美國之支持也。至於蘇聯，則她對德之保有現有關係者實出於昔日協約國不能與之合作而被迫出此者。是故今日英國苟能讓步，則蘇聯甚願與之連絡，如時則勝利在握矣！在遠東，雖對我國援助甚力，然依其一貫政策，則不欲有所發動也。（此可以張鼓峯之衝突，庫頁島漁權，諸問題見之）可知歐洲方面蘇聯足左右全局，在遠東則美國誠舉足輕重矣！於此情形下，我國經濟界，因之有親美，蘇之主張，尤其是親美，至於歐洲之經濟界，特別是英國，實有結好蘇聯之共感。</p>
<p>此外有柳系青，毛崇潔，島客，章榆梅，錢一石，樂慧，潘之華，顧秉乾，劉導鴻，等等先生所見近似。柳系青先生，且將美蘇政策之性格作基本之分析，尤堪欽佩；惜原文太長，只好割愛。</p>
<p>美重亞而蘇重歐</p>
<p>渡雲</p>
<p>美的世界政策，實以遠東為重；形式上似重歐洲。蘇倒以歐洲為重，形式上似重遠東。在輕重不同中，中國的經濟當與美發生更密切的關係；自然與蘇也一樣的關係。美蘇中三國在此微妙的連結中，所受大影響最大的，當推日本了。（未完）</p>

<h3>金融述評</h3>
<p>— 聖凱瓊</p>
<p>—八月三日止—</p>
<p>結匯商品的更動</p>
<p>中國政府最先管理出口外匯的方法，是規定桐油·豬鬃·皮革·羊毛·礦產等二十四類為應結外匯貨物，商人運輸這二十四類貨物出口時，先請貿易委員會估定外幣售價，依此金額向中央銀行簽訂承購外匯證明書，憑證明書，憑以辦理報關運輸手續。貨物出售後須按法定匯率向中央銀行售結，假如貨價所得低於貿易會的估計時，可提出售貨證件向該會申請減繳。實施的時期自二十七年五月至十二月止。二十八年一月起結匯貨物由二十四類減為十三類。二十八年七月起　桐油·茶葉·豬鬃·礦產四類由政府統籌運銷，其餘出口貨一概結匯出口，結售的金額不憑貿易會的估價，而憑該會所發的實售貨價證明書的九成，結匯的匯價亦改由中交銀行掛牌英金七便士美金十三元六二五以為標準。</p>
<p>管理出口外匯的目的是在集中外匯，以安定金融基礎，培養經濟力量。三年來中國政府對於這方面的努力，業已獲得很好的成績，二十七·二十八兩年商人預先拋售於政府銀行的外匯達一萬二千萬元。今年起結匯辦法又有變更，除桐油等四類仍由政府統籌運銷外，其他出口貨中規定蛋品·羽毛·腸衣·皮革·皮毛·五掊子·藥材·油蠟·苧蔴·棉科等十四類為應結外匯貨物，此外出口貨物可免結匯出口，結匯的金額照實售貨價證明書所填底八成結算，但貨物係由西南各省輾轉運出經過外國口岸的，因費用增加，為彌補商人損失起見，可減至七成。同時商人結匯時向銀行繳納外匯法價與銀行掛牌差額百分之三限度內的手續費，亦行豁免。現在的辦法，是從二十九年三月十五日起實行。</p>
<p>現行辦法和過去的比較，在結匯貨物的種類方面說，是與二十八年一月實行的十三類相仿佛。因為一切貨物都要結匯出口，徒增管理上的困擾，而有許多出口貨的數值都是很微少的。在結匯的辦法方面說，是與二十八年七月實行的憑貿易會埴發實售貨價證明書的辦法相同。在結匯的匯價底標凖方面說，亦仍舊採用領取法定匯價與商用匯價的差額底辦法。不過結匯的金額卻從九成減至八成，還可因費用特多而減至七成，這是因為自西南各省取道海防運至香港銷售的貨物，它的運費棧租·銷售傭金。稅捐等要佔到實售貨價的一成半，照二十八年七月的辦法，商人要損失半成。故減低成數，使商人有利可圖，俾出口貿易能夠增進，以加緊外匯的收集。</p>
<h3>商用匯率的改訂</h3>
<p>據重慶傳來的消息，中國財政部業經正式宣佈法幣的商用匯率自八月一日起改為四便士半，其他外國貨幣的匯率則根據它與英鎊的市場匯率十八年七月初財部公佈「進口物口申請購買外匯辦法」「出口貨物結匯領取匯價差額辦法」，規定進口外匯申請人須繳納按法價與中交兩行掛牌價差額的平衡費，出口外匯售給人可以領取法價與中交兩行掛牌價差額的匯價差，是為採用商用匯率之始。（未完）</p>

<p>病痿丈夫如何增強精力</p>
<p>愛情有決巧嗎？曰：什麼事情都有決巧，愛情當然也有決巧。那末，什麼是愛情的決巧呢？好讓求愛的男女，莫徬徨於歧途。得早日進入愛情的快樂之園！</p>
<p>我們知道一個懷春的少女，怒放著她一朵芬芳的心花，而又含羞地藏在情懷裏，簡直是諱莫似深。這路深情的女郎若嫁了一個精力豐足的健壯丈夫，那在春閨中頓時可把嬌妻吸引到歡暢而熱烈的境地，使她妙悟到人生幸福的可貴，於是愛情　　著，甜蜜著，生育著伶俐的子女，組織著美滿的家庭，生活是何等的歡樂！</p>
<p>可是男子若於早年犯有自瀆遺精，或縱濫淫，或憂勞過度，虧損了生殖腺內分泌液，或　傷了性能總樞的神經。則凡早洩陽痿，發育不全，腎虧不育，腰　背痛，腦衰健忘，未老先衰等症象即不一而足。此種病痿丈夫，雖在袒胸露腿良夜，雖有嬌妻擁抱，但在夫婦間的愛情生活上。每衰弱無能，或曇花一現，或竟完全不能入道。這在男子自身，固屬無趣之至，而在正濃情蜜意的妻子，又焉能不生憎恨之心，一而再，再而三後，由些而愛情完全毀滅，致演出私奔，離婚，瘋狂，自殺等家庭悲劇者，亦多不勝計！</p>
<p>病痿男子，務速治愈其疾病！欲為丈夫，更須增強其精力！治愈病痿，增強精力的方法據世界名醫及余等經驗，均以服健壯動物生殖腺素製劑「生殖素」最為對症特效。因此劑係根據新醫學上最有效之補給療法的原理，採取態鹿，猩猩，海狗等體中的生殖腺內分泌精華，骼科學複製法精製而成，所以品質貴重，功效確實，補力偉大，為任何類似制劑所不及。男子於服用「生殖素」後，一日夜間卽生精補腎，助長發育，健腦活血，滋養神經，繼續連服，必於短期內治愈各症，使精力倍增。中老年人常服則延年益壽，返老還童。惟患遺精症者，須兼服治遺特效藥「希米脫氏固精片」（中西五洲太和等大藥房均售），以制止潰洩，則收效尤速！</p>
<p>愛情的訣巧，只有治愈暗疾，增強精力，此外別無他法，求愛男女，莫再徬徨於歧途！</p>
<p>健美</p>
<h3>乳峯萎的悲哀</h3>
<p>— 美國醫學博士姚崇培</p>
<p>凡是廁身都市，頭腦較新一些的人物，誰都知道對於現代女性的審美觀念，是著重於特徵發達的健康美，而不是矯柔造作的病態美了。所謂特徵發達的健康美者，就是必須有高聳而具彈性的乳峯，與豐腴而相稱的臀部，靈活而織細的柳細，此外如步行時的姿態等。誠能具備此數者，則曲線畢露，姿態宜人面貌雖平凡，亦可出入交際場中，博得多數男子的讚美，獲得無上光榮與幸福。反之，如乳峯萎癟，臀部削瘦，肌肉枯槁，曲線毫無者。縱面似西子，身如飛燕，濃妝艷抹，招搖過市，亦徒為識者所譏，有何幸福可言！不但此也。且乳峯萎癟的女性，其生殖腺卵巢機能失健，必連帶患有月經不調，白帶汛濫，營養不良，不感不妊等症，因之生育艱難，終身而不獲一孕，或雖孕而竟至流產，或生不期年，卽遭夭殤，凡此種種，當之者方似尤箭攢心，哀痛無極，而不諒的丈夫，卻聲聲以「不孝有三，無後為大」為辭，以達娶妾的私願，迨丈夫的私願既達，於是愛情中斷，有時雖欲謀一面而不可得，尚望綢繆繾綣愛戀永固乎？故此輩女性每抑　以終，其命運至為悲慘！良深浩歎！故時至今日，對乳峯萎癟一症，絕對不可忽視，應立即購卵巢內分泌制劑女用「生殖素」以謀補救，此劑成分高貴，藥性和平，功效準確，連服二星期，即覺食欲大增，頭腦明晰，四肢輕快，不覺疲乏，連服四星期，最顯著者，乳部似有徵感，由平坦而成微聳，由松懈而呈現堅實，若服至八星期後，不但乳峯發育，有驚人的收獲，同時且連一切宿疾隱病完全治愈，還你固有的健美，那才使你驚奇功效卓越呢。</p>
<h3>遺精失治將葬送青春</h3>
<p>— 性病專科醫師詹念曾</p>
<p>在春情發動期的青年，實是他一生的緊要關頭。這時若意志薄弱，犯了手淫惡癖，或早婚縱欲，摧殘了性神經，使精關松馳者，必爆發著遺精症。精液在生理學上言，即所謂生殖腺內分泌液，功能滋養神經，調節情緒，助長發育，促進新陳代謝，所以凡潔身自愛，清心寡欲的青年，他必然發育健全，頭腦清明，前途無量，婚後的幸福無窮！今患遺精症而因循失治，卽等於生命源泉有了漏　而不塞住，則涓滴不塞，會潰成江海，精關必日愈松馳，遺洩的次數必日益增加，以體內可貴而有限的生殖腺內分泌液，長此遺洩，怎能不枯竭？於是凡腦衰健忘，失眠心悸，腰　背痛，早洩陽痿，發育不全，未老先衰等症象卽不一而足。此種青年，昏憒無能，不特求學不進，習業難成，茫茫前途，毫無希望，且因體貌不揚，房事不能滿美，每為女性所棄，妻妾所憎恨，青春幸福，因此葬送無遺！</p>
<p>其實，遺精症並非為不治之症。在今日醫學昌明的時代，且已有了最對症而特效的療法，此即服「希米脫氏固精片」，當夜可收鞏固精關，鎮靜神經，安眠此遺之特效。如因遺精已有述症象者，須兼服健壯動物生殖腺素制劑「生殖素」，以培補腦腎，增益精血，滋養神經，助長發育，連服一月，必能將上述症象治愈於無形，而使身體強壯，精力培增。患者若能親來本診所，兼施電療注射等新療法，必可保證治愈。</p>
<h3>（一）手淫是遺精的前因</h3>
<p>— 性病專科醫師詹念曾</p>
<p>黃福祥君，年十八歲，無錫人·家住小沙渡路安樂裏。在本埠某中學肄業，頗為聰明，父母甚愛之。詎知近來日漸面黃肌瘦，夜多夢　失眠，日間神思恍惚，學業成績一落千丈。其父疑之，乃細察其睡眠及行動，始知其子因喜讀艷情小說而致入迷。並犯手淫惡習，已使精關松馳，患有遺精症。所以凡腦弱，健忘，失眠，心悸，腰　背痛，面黃肌瘦，發育不全等症象叢生。幾乎誤了黃群的前途，葬送了黃君的青春。其父乃嚴令其子戒絕手淫，並率其子親至本診所診治，由專家醫師詳細診斷其症狀後，卽囑其赴五洲大藥房購「希米脫氏固精片」三匣，「生殖素」半打，使兼服，並施以電療注射等新療術，為時不過一月，遺精症已完全治癒，並覺頭腦清之明，思想豐富，面紅體壯，學業進步又一日千裏矣！</p>
<h3>（二）早洩陽痿的病夫愧對其妻</h3>
<p>馮剛君，卅歲，婚後五年。因馮君患早洩陽痿與遺精之故，從未生育，夫婦愛情淡薄，其妻因不耐青春虛度，乃暗結私歡，正欲與情人商議私奔，幸事機不密為馮君察覺。然因自身患疾，除稍加斥責外，只得忍辱而已，馮君因此覺悟，上月親至本診所診治，經專家醫師診察其病狀後，即屬其購「生殖素」一打及「希米脫氏固精片」三匣，使之兼服，並施以電療注射等新療法，為時未及一月，頃已精力豐足，身體強壯，夫婦間愛情繾綣，其妻亦死心塌地種情於其丈夫雲。</p>

<h3>種銀</h3>
<p>迷信者謂神仙有點金之術，惜大羅天無　　市廛之盛，金銀無所用之故，神仙亦自秘之，獨神仙自不須用，而所需金銀者正復不少，苟以濟人利物爲懷，何妨顯其神通，普利一世，乃亦不肯自炫其術，忍令腰槖空虛者，徒存揮霍之心，而不得一償所欲；床頭金盡者，甘受飢寒之困，而不能自遂其生，然則神仙亦忍人也。蒲柳仙志異所載雨錢一事，明明選大靑錢作母，禹步念咒，如法施符，而自樑間落下者，果然鏘鏘有聲，頃刻堆錢沒踝，約有數十萬貫，閉門而出，止以索酬太奢，主人性吝，頓使滿戶之錢，化蚨飛去，僅存母錢上數枚，事雖荒唐，亦因以見貪人之多愚，而造物之戲弄人也。近南翔民婦舒氏竟能以虛誕之言，哄動婦女，使爭輸本銀而令其代種，聞愈遠來者愈多，致爲所愚者已百餘家。迨至銀被騙去，猶復以未到其時，不宜開看，違敎干怒等語給之，而愚婦反哀懇之，欲其代爲解脫。嗚呼！舒婦果操何術而令人堅信耶？</p>

<p>衣食住行</p>
<h3>衣食住行—最　新科學觀</h3>
<p>— 周南陔</p>
<p>衣食住行關係於人生之經濟，體力，及社會國家之興衰貧富者至巨，而吾人日常習慣，每忽不注意，其間重大損失，不覺不知，可勝浩嘆！列强民智高深，亟亟加意研究，努力改進，學者倡導，政府與人民合力奉行，不止偭人之智愚壽夭，家庭之安樂幸福已也。愚自蟄居滬瀆，五戰於茲，閉戶養疴，頗涉獵於衛生典籍，茲擇最新之學說，略舉其凡，以讅國人之留心健康與驚心衰老者。</p>
<p>德國羅蘭博士，研究長壽醫學，具有威權者也，名著「衰老之原因及其預防」一書，收入世界醫學百科全書，己再版七次，譯成十二國語文，（中文爲丁福保譯，五月甫出版）除以藥物治療內分泌腺外，而尤注意於日常之衣食住行，爰探摘要義，簡叙於次：</p>
<p>衣：宜寬薄通風，不宜堅緊，而允反對時行之硬領及皮鞋</p>
<p>食：宜蔬素，少量肉食，當然屛絕烟酒及刺激物，但歷舉各國之健壽者，百歲之外，亦間有略用極少量之烟酒者。住：宜野外，山上，海邊，戶外生活，最好露宿，而極反對電梯。</p>
<p>行：宜步行，汽車遊　等，反對火車之擠亂汚濁。</p>
<p>所舉粗視似平庸，但列具之方法，根據之學理，均精深博湛，極與他人學說不同，又舉各種病症原因，預防及治療之特效，包括近世各派之長，而折衷至當，愚意西俗每好其偏，故產生之哲理多窮其極，此公持論，頗與吾國舊學契合，處處取道中庸，力愼過猶不及之戒，在西哲中不可多得者也。如性生活之主張，不主絕禁，喪禮之顏色，贊美吾國之尚白，而反對西俗之黑，（影饗神經情緒）在在可證吾先哲化導世俗，體恤人情，演成善良之風俗，確有至理，而寓强種健身之大效於日常微細動作之中焉。愚非頑固泥古，特有鑒於科學新發現，實與往哲同揆，不期然而欣幸吾民族文化之偉大，而益自信自重，願國人之自壯也。</p>
<p>臟器療法，近時西藥盛行，按吾國食療之原理，行之千年矣，礦質藥物，起衰防老，晋人服食五色散，及方士丹藥，均重礦物也，特煉質未純，施用未當，故引以爲戒耳，至其見地，確與科學新法無殊。吾國醫藥，豈僅草根樹皮哉，實則包羅萬象，莫不以經騐致其功，不似西人前此之止重礦質。他如駐顏之學，與長壽相表裏，吾國致意甚久，頗多專籍，今羅蘭書中，亦推述光學，氣候，藥物之忌宜，不能悉舉，姑止於此，倘深研者，有原書在。</p>
<p>夫衣食住行，本以衛生，今俗多以戕生，（富貴而無正確知識者尤甚）良以不明生理，不明事物原理，故日日時時自戕其生而不覺，社會窮困，疾病纒綿，而死亡增率，大可哀矣。更至衰而求醫，病而求藥，鮮有補於死弱，曷不先加之意，豫增知識於平時歟？</p>
<h3>衣服和臭氣</h3>
<p>— 白水</p>
<p>我們身上所穿的衣服，不論是棉織品或是毛緻品，都具有吸收各種氣體和潮濕的性質，因此，我們就得處處地方要加以當心了。一個朋友，租住了醬園作坊的餘屋，雖然他並不和醬去接觸，然而他走到人家面前，人家就老是嗅到了一股醬的氣味。香粉店中的夥計，他們臉上並不擦上香粉，身上也並不洒有香水，可是走到人家的面前，人家的鼻中，就一直有着一股醉人的香氣。這是什麼緣故呢？因爲，我們身上所穿的衣服，能够吸收一種氣息的緣故。</p>
<p>織物的吸收氣候，隨了質料而有所不同，普通以毛織物保存的氣體爲最久而蔴織物爲最短，還有，濕的布對於吸收氣體也較易於乾布。穿了皮袍子或是鬆厚的呢羢衣服，如果走進卽臭氣薰天的不潔的厠所，衣服上吸着的臭氣，至少要一二天才能發散，所以，我們自己的身上雖然注意着淸潔，但我們走到不潔的地上，身上自然會染到了一股氣息的。</p>
<p>爲了衣服要吸收氣息的緣故，所以我們走到上容的面前，我們應該把衣服換一下，免得帶了一股穢氣去衝人。我們平日間，因了不當心而衣服上染上了討厭的氣味，這是很難免的事。我們自己，因爲習慣了，所以不覺得，這正如「入鮑魚之肆，久而不聞其臭」是一個道理的。我們走到上客之前，應當不管自己身上有沒有臭氣，還是細心些把衣服換一下的好。</p>
<p>一個人的身上，不停的一直在流汗，這汗液中間，也是含有不少的臭氣的。我們衣服不常換，也可以從汗液方面染到臭氣。在冬天，我們把襯衣或外衣換換，中間的衣服，似乎不會不潔的了。其實不然，因爲織物會吸收氣息，所以襯衣上的汗臭，依然還是可以被中層的衣服吸去的。所以，在冬天，中曆的衣服，也應當常常換換才是。</p>
<h3>關於維他命的話</h3>
<p>— 愛農</p>
<p>日前本刋刋載拙作「經濟的維他命Ｃ」一文後，竟能引起讀者的注意由編者轉來劉露秋，陳蘭卿二君來函，承詢服用何種物品是最經濟而富有維他命ＡＢＤＥ？今答覆如下，如有不妥之處，尚請指敎。</p>
<p>維他命Ａ和人體的發育有關，牛乳，蛋黃，魚肝油，乳酪等食品中都含有，而魚肝油是供給維他命Ａ最豐富的東西，不過上列的幾樣食品是比較貴族了一些，一般普通人家是不會上口的，但是在菠菜和萵苣等那種綠葉的蔬菜中也含有一點，它們的價格是便宜得多，而含量當不及魚肝油，不過我們一定要吃新鮮的，如果不新鮮的，那維他命Ａ的含量是微乎其微的了。</p>
<p>脚氣病是一種很苦痛的疾病，是缺乏維他命Ｂ所致成，尤其在孤島上所吃的，大都是經過機器打磨的西貢米，多吃了最容易息這種病，因爲維他命Ｂ是含在米的胚子中，經過機器打磨後，米胚完全除去，僅剩了一粒澱粉，澱粉中是沒有維他命Ｂ的，所以我們當常吃黃糙米，在上海不容易買到有的米店中掛着「衛生米」的市招，那就是人工打磨的黃米，在內地黃米的價格比較便宜，可是一到了上海，加上了「衛生」的頭銜，反比白米來得貴了•除了米之外，在豆和水果中，尤其是在橘子檸檬中含有一點，可是橘子和檸檬的價格是貴得可以，那只得不吃，但是可買些赤豆，最和常常燒些赤豆飯，赤豆粥，赤豆湯吃吃，都以淡的爲宜。育菜中也有一些維他命Ｂ能溶解在水裏，所以在煮菜的時候，切不可把湯倒去。</p>
<p>維他命Ｄ在日常食物中的含量很少，五穀中絕對沒有一些，就是葉綠的菜蔬中也沒有，但據最近的發表，美國密西西比河所產河豚屬的Ｒufferfish的肝油中含量很多，那我們也無法服用。以後有許多學者的研究，發現太陽光綫中的紫外綫，照射到人身體上，在人體的皮膚及皮下脂中，有一種麥角醉，受到了紫外綫的影響，在體內生成維他命Ｄ。所以我們要得到維他命Ｄ，就要使紫外綫射到我們身上，要知紫外綫不能透過玻璃窗，故常居住在房屋中，便不能得到。尤其在夏天，太陽光中的紫外綫最强，所以有人提倡日光浴。不過在這孤島上，就是能常常到空曠的公園中，多見見太陽的面，多被太陽光照照也就好了。我們不用怕它，因爲它是我們的營養品呢！</p>
<p>維他命Ｅ是能促進懷妊機能，牛乳，白米，玉蜀黍，萵直中都含有一點。</p>
<p>維他命的發展眞是前途無量，維他命Ｅ已有人發現，將來或許還有更多的收穫哩。</p>
<h3>續記關於住的故事</h3>
<p>— 鏞</p>
<p>唐朝的大詩人杜甫，中年時代，家境貧苦，以致祇能住在草屋內。在一個在風暴雨的午晚，屋上所舖茅草都吹掉了；那時候杜甫所睡的床，被漏進來的雨水淋得簡直完全濕了。可是杜甫非但不抱怨自己的處境，並且由此而加深了對於世界上一般貧窮人士的同情，他願望着有一天他們都有好的住處，那麼他雖仍侷促於這種草屋內，亦是非常甘心的。當時，就吟了一段詩，其中有這樣的幾句：「安得廣厦千萬間，大庇天下寒士盡歡顏」，願今日孤島上狠心的二房東，皆能一聽斯言，而莫再一味求個人的利益而置他人於不顧。</p>
<p>蘇軾，名列唐宋八大家之一，有一次，他在宜興買了一所房屋，手續已辦妥，價錢亦付淸；可是，後來仍舊把它退還給了原來的屋主。原來的屋主是一位年已花甲的老婆婆，因爲伊的兒子不長進，以致無法才把伊視上遺傳下的一點產業變買了。蘇軾看到了這種情形，心內當然有所感動了，結果，預付的錢是不要伊還了，而房屋亦仍舊歸了伊。求諸現世之人，實有不勝今昔之嘆！</p>
<h3>路</h3>
<p>— 連</p>
<p>凡是從小生長在鄉下的，走慣了泥濘路，踏遍了碎石路，一旦跑到上海，看見了光滑平坦的柏油路及水泥路，不免要伸一下舌頭驚嘆一聲吧。當看到南京路是一塊塊整齊柚木塊所堆積成的時候，更要嘆爲奇觀了，然而在這科學昌明的時代，無奇不有的世界上，也正有許多奇奇怪怪的道路哩。</p>
<p>在英國，有人將各種碎玻璃重新溶化，並用模型製成方塊以作舖路的磚頭，路面很是堅固。在捷克並將碎玻璃和水泥混在一起，叫做「二和土」的來舖路，効力據說是非常偉大的。</p>
<p>在南菲洲金柏萊地方有一條馬路，全路上嵌滿了光彩奪目的珍珠，寶石，以及巨大的金剛鑽，全路的價值約值五百萬美金，這條路可說是全世界價值最高的道路了。</p>
<p>在印度，他們利用了製糖廠的大量廢物—價格低廉的糖漿來舖路，成爲絕妙的「冲柏油馬路」，在美國，更用棉花夾在二層柏油之間，使馬路堅固，這正同把鋼骨夾入水泥中一樣。</p>
<p>在上面所說的，不過是一小部分，其他更奇怪更新型的不知有多少呢？像用橡皮，鈍鋼，食鹽等物製馬路，不過我們沒有知道罷了。</p>

<p>前天本刊編者先生轉來一位署名「恨命」的讀者的來信，自稱是服務於一家複雜的家庭中充小飯司者，文字相當通順，字也寫得不壞，大可給人家做做書記，怎麼充一個小飯司，未免可惜了。據信中說，他的主婦是個古怪的女人，不知道外問市面，每天照着我的菜單配菜，硬說八角錢就够了；因此常嫌他買來的菜太貴。這位小飯司受了寃枉氣，所以要我說明一聲，每天我所配的兩葷兩素，到底要多少錢？如今我要奉告這位小飯司先生，貴主婦的確不知道市面情形，在兩年以前，每天八角錢確已够了，如今却非加倍不可。我這菜單的經濟二字，本是比較的，而不是絕對的，譬如一個中人之家，大小八九口，以每天一元五六角吃兩葷兩素的菜，在比較上要算是經濟的了。我的支配方法，是兩葷限一元，兩素限半元左右，吾家每天就是如此。貴主婦要是不信任你，不妨請伊一同到小菜塲去跑幾天，就可明瞭一切，而不致於給你吃寃枉氣了。</p>

<h3>關於「學徒的幸福」</h3>
<p>— 丁人</p>
<p>讀到了七月卅日本刊的學徒的幸福」以後，頗有一點感想，因此，也想來談下：</p>
<p>給在痛苦中生活着的學徒一點精神上的鼓勵和安慰，並不能算是件壞事，但抹殺了客觀事實的存在而以中觀的想像來衡量一切，那未免是蹈入了「唯心論」的觀點，而錯誤地理解了作者所應有的「世界觀」，也就是作者所站的立塲。因此在這位幸福者的作品裏，我們不但沒有看到指示學徒們去　得眞正幸福的方向，而是嗅到了滿紙的階級氣息；我們不但沒有瞧見澈底改造學徒生活的指針，而是萎廢的改良主義的作風；換句話說，這不是向統治這社會的少數人鬥爭；而是向少數人屈服來謀取個人的出路。將來則更進步的好由「學徒，老闆…」而自己變成少數人，慢慢的再來造成從前自己嘗試過的「學徒」批發所。同時，這位「幸福者」完全沒有估計到整個民挨的，集體的力量，而把個人生路脫離了民族的生路來完成、個人的奮鬥史」，這是非常錯誤的理解，但這也就是說，「幸福者」祇是看到了現象，而抓不住本質。</p>
<p>其次，在「幸福」一文中所舉的例子，全是英美的名人，而忽略了自己是站在中國，是在爲中國的學徒謀出路；是漠視了中國社會制度，社會性質與英美各國的不同，是拿英美的資本主義社會同中國的半封建半殖民地的社會來混爲一談；是不看淸現有的中國學徒的現實生活狀况，而是說着主觀的「風凉話」。其實，憑良心說，要改變現在的淘米，洗菜，生風爐，抱小孩，洗尿布……學徒生活」，斷不是枝節的局部的問題。卽便退一萬步來說，正如這位　幸福者」所理想的，頂多造成幾個老闆」，「經理」之流的「大人物」，到底全世界的愛迪生就祇有那麼一個，更何况美國與中國社會性質的異殊呢？</p>
<p>因此，我的意見以爲要合理解決學徒們痛苦的現生活，就應該跟整個民族的解放連在一起，這也正像婦女要得到解放，她就必需在本位努力，而其努力本位的目標，無疑地是整個民族所謀取的同一鵠的，所以，學徒生活的解決，也應該是這個整體中的一環。假如硬要把它分離開來，結果是會鑽到「牛角尖」去的。</p>
<p>最後，我在這裏代學徒們作一誠懇的呼籲：第一，請老闆，師父們把眼界放遠些，看看中國現在是什麼時候，躭誤靑年們寳貴的光陰，不但對不起學徒本人，更對不起國家，民族。第二，我反對這位「幸福者」的個人奮鬥方法，而是應該用集體的方法來學習，來奮鬥：學徒們應該找自己週圍的學徒朋友，或者比較進步的師父或切身的上層份子團叙起來，這樣才能眞正的集思廣益，才能學到自己所要學的知識，同時，也祗有這樣，才能解脫目前的痛苦，而得到眞正的幸福，否則，要是跟這位「幸福者」來跑的話，那末，一輩子也跑不到光明的路上去的。像最近我看到一張影片—航空英雄裏有這樣一句話：「爲什麼平凡的家庭裏，會產生這樣的偉大人物呢？」那就不得不歸功於社會的澈底改造了。第三，我希望社會熱心公益的人士，能出來辦幾所像報童學校」似的學徒學校，那才是功德無量。雖然上海的環境惡劣，但這種社會公益的事情，却還沒有到被全部「封鎖」的時候，因此，這並不是被別人銷不鎖的問題，而是願不願做的問題！以上的意見，雖然淺陋不堪，但爲了謀學徒們眞正的幸福，却不能不將管見陳述，以待識者的指正。</p>
<p>業餘漫談</p>
<h3>讀「學徒的幸福」後</h3>
<p>— 史偉</p>
<p>讀了上月三十一日本刋曹靈佑君的「學徒的幸福」之後，我覺得有許多話要說出來；首先，我非常同意曹君的寫那篇文章的主觀願望，那就是『無非是要來證明做學徒的人，實在不應太悲觀，應當抓住忍耐的機會，奮力的工作，則總　成功的一天。」這種在惡劣環境下不肯氣餒而力求上進的精神是應該予以發揚的。</p>
<p>但是，從客觀的效果上講，曹君的那篇文章會使人家得出可怕的結論來；我讀了該文兩遍之後的印象是這樣的：那就是人們樂得爲學徒，雖然學徒幹着「卑賤的工作」，拿着「還不够買一日常生活必需品一的津貼，受「老關的脾氣」…但這些對學徒却是幸福的。因之，學徒制度也是合理的了。</p>
<p>曹君用愛迪生等的成就來證明做學徒並不是沒有出息的，其用意頗爲善良；但是我要問，像愛迪生，威爾斯，富蘭克林之輩究竟是千萬個學徒當中的幾個呢？</p>
<p>一時想不出通俗的例子，還是翻書吧，我的手頭邊有本外國語的小冊子，這裏　有這樣的一節：</p>
<p>「院庭裏的花草是灰色的，細薄的和軟弱的。爲什麼它們會灰色和敝弱的呢？因爲它們是生在大松樹的下面，大松樹驕傲地仲展着它的枝幹而完</p>

<h3>舞后的歸宿</h3>
<p>— 程小青著</p>
<p>第四章　幾種推想</p>
<p>我瞧見那茶房的號衣上果真有紅綫繡着71的號碼。這是個二十多歲的少年，一雙烏黑的眼睛，已充分表示出他不單靈敏，而且是訓練有素」。不過大旅館裏待役的訓練的主要科目，並不是怎樣待應旅客，却在如何辦別旅客們錢袋口寬緊，和如何撈錢。這七十一號把眼角向他的手掌裏瞟了一瞟，又抬頭向霍桑和我估量一下，便點點頭，立即表演出他的訓練工夫來。</p>
<p>「先生，什麼事？」那先生的稱呼，分明是他的手黨裏的東西所產生的反應。</p>
<p>霍桑道：「這七十四號裏住的什麼樣人？」</p>
<p>那茶房疑遲了一下，答道：「一男一女，姓金。」</p>
<p>「那男的是不是一個穿西裝的少年？」「不，是個老頭兒，穿中裝的。那女的年紀倒還不過二十多歲。」我一聽這話，不能不再度失望。這當然不是我們所要我尋的人。但霍桑仍沒有消極的表示。</p>
<p>他繼續問道：「他們幾時來的？」</p>
<p>七十一號答道：「才到—不到一個鐘頭。」霍桑的眼睛裏閃了一閃。「那末，昨天住的什麼人？」那靈敏的茶房好像忽然想起了什麼，忙應道：「是個少年是的，穿西裝的，個子很高，姓錢。」</p>
<p>霍桑迅速地從胸口袋裏摸出那張小照片來。「是這個人麼？」</p>
<p>那侍役把照片瞧了一瞧，連連點頭說：「正是這個人。他昨天才搬走—不，其實是今天搬走的。」</p>
<p>我的希望突然恢復過來，心裏當然非常高興。</p>
<p>霍桑又問道：「到底什麼時候搬走的？」（六六）全遮蔽了太陽的光綫。</p>
<p>『並且僧侶和寺院裏的僕役常常踐踏它們，損　了它們的萌芽，因之，院庭裏的花草是灰色的和軟弱的。</p>
<p>「現在我們來看河旁的花草。它們充分地享受太陽的光綫，自由地吸收水份，因之它們可以欣欣向榮。它們是强健的，它們愉快地活着，它們舒適地和驕傲伸展着綠油油的葉子。」</p>
<p>顯然地　愛迪生之輩畢竟是院庭裏的花草中，偶然得到太陽的光綫和未被僧侶踐踏過而生長的幾枝而已。而犬多數却是生得灰色而軟弱的。那末，我們希望在社會上有幾個數得淸的愛迪生之輩，還楚數不淸的愛迪生之輩，像河旁的花草　樣？</p>
<p>曹君也談到吃苦問題，但我認爲是缺少原則的：關於道，我在上月二十四日本刊上的「談學徒」一文裏已經指出過，這裏該帶住了。</p>
<p>正文已完，但我還有些感想；我因學徒問題的被人注意而感到高興。因之，我個人希望曾經做過學徒和正做着學徒的本刋讀者諸君，　把他們自身體驗到的種種寫出來；這樣，不是可使我們的理論更切近於現實嗎？</p>

<h3>London Arrests Japanese Residents: British Government Rejects Japanese Protest, US Acknowledges British Action as Strong Move, Japanese Newspaper Advocates Recalling Ambassador and Severing Ties with Britain</h3>
<p>London: The British government today rejected Japan's protest over the arrest of two Japanese residents in London, stating that the action was entirely for the sake of British "national defense." The British Foreign Office has firmly stated that even though the Japanese ambassador has demanded the release of these two Japanese residents, Britain will not abandon its hard-line stance. (International News Agency, 4th)</p>
<p>Stockholm: The Japanese government's letter of protest regarding the arrest of two Japanese residents in London was delivered to British Foreign Secretary Halifax yesterday by Japanese Ambassador Mamoru Shigemitsu. (Haitong Telegraph, 4th)</p>
<p>London: When the Japanese Ambassador to Britain visited the Foreign Office yesterday, Foreign Secretary Halifax informed him that the arrest of the Japanese residents was based on the Aliens Act and was done for national security reasons. It should not be seen as retaliation for the arrest of British residents in Japan. The Japanese Ambassador immediately expressed his hope that it would be quickly clarified that the arrested Japanese residents had not committed any crimes endangering national security. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>London: According to sources from the Japanese side last night, the British arrest of three wealthy Japanese merchants residing in Britain will inevitably make the Japanese feel the need to establish a deep understanding with Germany and Italy. At the same time, it will make Japan eager to resolve its disputes with the Soviet Union. Although it is generally expected that the Japanese garrison troops in Northeast China will oppose this move, it is said that the result of this action may be that the Japanese Navy will blockade Hong Kong. While Japanese Ambassador to Britain Mamoru Shigemitsu was discussing this matter with British Foreign Secretary Halifax, the Japanese Embassy in London also held a meeting. Although it is believed here that Britain has notified the United States of every detail, the widespread rumor that Britain and the United States have reached an agreement on Far Eastern policy is not considered credible. It is believed that Shigemitsu told Lord Halifax that this kind of arrest was "inopportune." It is said that Shigemitsu also said, "This sudden move by the British authorities seems to have no effect." Informed sources say that Lord Halifax told the Japanese Ambassador that he also hoped that normal relations between the two countries could be restored. At the same time, the government remained absolutely silent about the arrests, but stated that the action was to ensure national security and had nothing to do with the arrest of British residents in Tokyo. It is believed that the Japanese were arrested under the Aliens Act. Only the names of two of the three arrested persons have been publicly released. The two are Makihara and Tanabe. Tanabe is the deputy manager of Mitsui &amp; Co., who came here from India two months ago. It is reported that his wife is a British woman. Neutral parties believe that Tokyo will demand that the British government immediately release the arrested Japanese residents, otherwise, a crisis will occur in British-Japanese relations. (United Press, 4th)</p>
<p>Washington: Political figures here yesterday viewed the arrest of prominent Japanese businessmen residing in Britain in London on Friday as an unexpected expression of vitality in British policy toward Japan. Political figures believe that the British authorities' arrest of Japanese residents indicates that although Britain is busy fighting Germany, it still deeply believes in all the strength of its country. The arrest of Japanese residents is generally seen as a retaliatory move by the British authorities for the Japanese authorities' arrest of British residents residing in Japan on espionage charges. Some people here view the arrest of Japanese residents by the British authorities as a strengthening of the attitude of the British political circles, indicating that Britain has increased confidence in being able to resist any possible German attacks. On the British side, Royal Air Force bombers bombed German industrial centers, oil stations, and other strategically relevant locations, increasing the confidence of neutral observers in Britain. Some people believe that the strengthening of Britain's attitude toward Japan is partly due to the United States' firm policy toward Japan. (United Press, 4th)</p>
<p>Hong Kong: Tokyo dispatch. Regarding the British arrest of three important Japanese residents in London, the commentaries in various newspapers here all stated that Britain's intention was to force Japan to promptly release the British people arrested on suspicion of espionage and to force Japan to abandon its inclination toward the Axis powers. The commentary in the Hochi Shimbun has taken an unusually strong stance, urging the Japanese government to take drastic and effective measures, recall the Japanese Ambassador to Britain, sever diplomatic relations with Britain, and hoping that the Japanese government will immediately take the necessary actions before severing diplomatic relations to clearly express its attitude to Britain. The Chung Ngoi Commercial News stated that we do not need to investigate the motives of the British arrest of Japanese residents, as this move by the British is clearly a retaliatory action taken against Japan's arrest of British residents suspected of espionage. When the British House of Lords met on the 30th of last month, Foreign Secretary Halifax mentioned retaliatory measures in response to questions. Moreover, the British diplomatic and press circles have also advocated arresting Japanese residents, imposing economic sanctions on Japan, and reopening the Burma Road. The above points clearly prove that Britain's motive is retaliation. The Japanese government should promptly announce the inside story of the arrest of British residents to eliminate Britain's misunderstanding, etc. Newspapers affiliated with the Asahi Shimbun believe that after careful investigation of the case, the Japanese government should immediately take strong measures. Newspapers affiliated with the Nichi Nichi Shimbun stated that although Britain arrested Makihara and Tanabe as retaliation, the Japanese government's arrest of spies and suspected spies is absolutely proper. Under these circumstances, the best policy for Japan is to respond to violence with violence. The deterioration of British-Japanese relations should be the responsibility of the British side. The Japanese government should take effective measures against Britain to eliminate the network of foreign spies in Japan. The Yomiuri Shimbun also holds a similar view. (Dispatch, 4th)</p>
<p>Tokyo: The arrest of prominent Japanese businessmen in London has caused great excitement among the people here. The Ministry of the Army and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, having received the report from the Japanese Embassy in Britain, immediately held a meeting. The published official report shows that British-Japanese relations have once again become tense and expresses Japan's firm attitude towards this matter. It is expected that Japan will lodge a serious protest with London. Japanese military personnel are paying close attention to this. Military circles believe that Japan should respond to this British measure with the firmest attitude. Japanese newspapers are full of reports about this matter and demand that the authorities take even tougher measures to suppress international espionage activities. (Haitong News Agency, 4th)</p>
<p>Tokyo: The "Hochi Shimbun" reported yesterday that the Far Eastern division of the British intelligence department is also involved in international espionage activities within Japan. The Japanese authorities will conduct a thorough investigation. (Haitong News Agency, 4th)</p>
<p>London: The diplomatic correspondent for the Times of London mentioned the arrest of Japanese residents in Britain, saying that it is the opinion of people in London that Japan, under the strong influence of countless German personnel, is now trying to completely imitate Italy's actions in Germany before launching a blitzkrieg. When German troops were fighting in Norway, Italian newspapers launched an anti-Allied campaign, forcing us to leave part of our fleet in the Mediterranean. Therefore, the Japanese anti-British action is really intended to at least divert some of our forces' attention to the Far East. It is also said that a part of the Japanese army welcomes war with Britain, but the Japanese government may not share this opinion. The Japanese government is currently busy with the war against China and has no time for other matters. More rational Japanese people undoubtedly understand that Germany's scheme still contains the intention of provoking a Japanese-American war, so that American war resources to help Britain will be diverted to a larger extent to the Pacific, while Germany may also persuade Japan to take the Dutch East Indies on the pretext of the American ban on oil exports.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Japan and the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>When the Japanese government, led by Foreign Minister Arita, issued a statement on the Dutch East Indies issue this spring, it was fiercely criticized by the military and radicals. It is said that the reason for the criticism was not entirely due to the excessive mildness of that statement, but rather to blame Arita for his recklessness, believing that he had no grasp of the adjustment of Soviet-Japanese relations, and rashly expressing his determination to advance southward, which was a reckless adventure. It can be seen that the issue of Soviet-Japanese relations occupies a very important position in the minds of Japanese radicals because if Japan launches a southward advance without first adjusting its relations with the Soviet Union, it risks falling into a three-front war. Generally speaking, Japan's current position is very similar to that of Germany before the conclusion of the Soviet-German Pact. The only difference is that Japan is even more deeply mired in the war of aggression against China. Because of this, before preparing to launch a new adventure, it cannot but deeply consider the threat from the North Asian continent. On the other hand, only during the period when the Soviet Union and the United States and Britain lack understanding and coordination on the Far Eastern issue is it a good time for Japan to actually engage in the southward advance. From another perspective, if the conclusion of the Soviet-German Non-Aggression Pact last autumn can be seen as a signal for the outbreak of the European War, then if there are new improvements in the relationship between the Soviet Union and Japan in the future, it can also be seen as a prelude to the outbreak of the storm in the South Pacific.</p>
<p>The Konoe Cabinet's foreign policy recently announced by Yosuke Matsuoka has already been thoroughly analyzed in yesterday's newspaper editorial. On the Soviet side, the Federation Council and the Nationalities Council also passed Molotov's report on foreign policy on the first of this month. In contrast, what Japan has expressed is abstract and ambiguous, but its creeping greed has been exposed. In the report on the Soviet side, it is firm and concrete, always maintaining its neutrality and consolidating its domestic and foreign positions. Matsuoka's speech did not mention any of the major powers, and the phrase "create allies that can be created" undoubtedly takes the Soviet Union as one of its main targets. In Molotov's report, the possibility of improving Soviet-Japanese relations is more clearly shown, and it is even recognized that the Japanese side seems to have a tendency to improve relations. The establishment of ties between the two countries is like a match, and if the two sides are in love, they will hit it off immediately. However, today's issue of improving Soviet-Japanese relations, even if the Soviet Union has expressed this and the Japanese side has this demand, is complicated by various other connections. We cannot assert that there is no hope of success, but it is definitely not as smooth and rapid as the Soviet-German alliance in the past. The theory that Soviet-Japanese relations may be improved did not begin today but was first seen in Molotov's speech on the anniversary of the October Revolution last winter. In the past eight or nine months, the only achievement has been the demarcation agreement for the Halhin Gol area, which was established after a long period of negotiation. What remains is only the "possibility" of improving relations. Major international achievements often emerge between people without knowledge, while those that are repeatedly publicized in announcements and by people but have not been realized for a long time mostly have many difficulties that are difficult to overcome. Molotov certainly hinted at the possibility of increasing relations between the two countries, but he also criticized Japan's imperialist desires. He showed a more reserved attitude towards Konoe's "new system" and its political aspirations. Therefore, the Soviet Union has no reason to worry about its friendship with China, and that is by no means something that Japan's one-sided love can shake. Even in terms of the Soviet Union's attitude towards the Far Eastern crisis, there is no need to be pessimistic because the main key depends on how the international situation will change and be used in the future.</p>
<p>For the past year, Soviet policy has indeed focused on neutrality and self-preservation. If it has leaned to one side in the international arena, it has always been toward the Axis powers rather than the democracies. This phenomenon has made some anti-aggression and justice-loving people wring their hands, but it has its own origins and causes in history. Anti-Soviet sentiment that has existed since 1917 and the appeasement policy of the past three years are major factors that have contributed to the shift in the Soviet Union's diplomatic path a year ago. As long as these two factors are not eliminated, they will inevitably hinder the Soviet Union's cooperation in the anti-aggression and security movement. Although Nazi Germany was able to transform anti-communism into pro-Sovietism in the blink of an eye, in some democracies, the anti-Soviet tradition is deeply rooted, and it is difficult to eliminate even in times of national crisis. The Soviet Union, of course, regards its own security as more important than anything else, and at the same time, it is unwilling to simply become a tool for other countries in the face of a dangerous and volatile international situation. However, in this gap, it is also very likely to create opportunities for militaristic countries. The evils brewed and developed in Europe by anti-Soviet sentiment and appeasement policies have already doomed Czechoslovakia and Poland and destroyed Denmark, Norway, the Netherlands, Belgium, and even France. Whether or not the evils will continue to spread in the future depends entirely on whether the democracies can act decisively, recognize reality, and dispel the clouds of doubt and obscurity and the tangential barriers to the Soviet Union, and consider improving relations with the Soviet Union and helping China resist Japan in the same top priority. In Molotov's report, although there was no satisfactory expression regarding relations with the United States and Britain, it did not close the door to improving relations. The impetus for the development of this issue in the future will still focus on the democracies. Recently, the United States' firmness and activity in the Far East are almost unprecedented. Under the various stimuli of recent days, the British side has also begun to reconsider its past measures. Such an attitude of the United States and Britain can, on a normal basis, become the basis for improving relations with the Soviet Union. However, international phenomena often do not develop in a normal direction. For example, Molotov's expression that Soviet-Japanese relations may be improved can be interpreted as the Soviet Union's expression that the possibility of improving relations with the United States and Britain is more distant. However, it must also be clearly recognized that even if Soviet-Japanese relations are improved, Japan will be guaranteed that there will be no more worries about the north, but by no means will the Soviet Union's relations with the United States and Britain actually deteriorate as a result, let alone that the Soviet Union will sacrifice its friendship with China. The subtle distinctions in the middle only need to understand the Soviet Union's policy of self-preservation and neutrality in any international war to understand. Such observations do not mean that Soviet-Japanese relations must be improved. It must be known that: (1) In order to invade China, what Japan seeks from the Soviet Union is not only to guarantee that there will be no worries about the north but also to ask the Soviet Union to stop its aid to China. This is what the Soviet Union should never allow, and what Japan has despaired of. For this reason, Soviet-Japanese relations have not improved in the past three years. (2) In order to implement the southward advance, what Japan seeks from the Soviet Union is only the guarantee that there will be no worries about the north.

<p>In the third line of yesterday's editorial, there is a sentence: "Dongbao called it the 'basic national policy of the Konoe Cabinet'," Dongbao refers to a Japanese newspaper; it was mistakenly written as "Benbao," which was not the original intention. I hereby correct it urgently.</p>
<h3>Production Committee Supports Guam's High Defense Proposal, Funds Will Be Appropriated for Defense Construction, Congressman Maas Issues Statement</h3>
<p>Washington: Congressman Maas, a Republican from the Production Committee and a member of the House Naval Affairs Committee, told United Press reporters yesterday in an exclusive interview that Vincent, chairman of the House Naval Affairs Committee, promised to fully support the Guam complete defense proposal. The defense funding would require approximately US$80 million to US$250 million. Maas announced that the Naval Affairs Committee last week had rejected the Guam defense proposal, but Vincent assured him that Vincent would support the proposal next year. A few days ago, the House of Representatives voted to allocate hundreds of thousands of dollars for non-military improvements on Guam, but no funds were allocated for the island's defense. Maas said, "I firmly believe that Congress is prepared to defend the island. In fact, if the proposal can be submitted for discussion next Monday, Congress may immediately allocate funds. I believe that defending Guam is extremely important for the defense of the United States and its territories." Maas also said that unless Guam is defended, it will be impossible to defend the Philippines. Converting Guam into a complete naval base would require US$250 million. Maas believed that the change in Congress's attitude towards strengthening Guam's defense was largely due to Japan's recent changes in foreign and domestic policies, as well as the rapid evolution of world events. Congress previously rejected the Guam defense proposal largely to avoid offending Japan because the island is too close to Japan. Other members of Congress also said that the sentiment in Washington in support of defending Guam has increased. (United Press, 4th)</p>
<p>Washington: The United States has allocated 4,300,000 gold yuan to increase air force and naval bases in the Aleutian Islands, Kodiak Island, and other places. These islands are only 700 miles from the northern islands of Japan. According to well-informed sources, this decision to strengthen defense is less than two weeks away from the Soviet Union's action to defend the Diomede Islands in the Bering Strait.

<h3>Horinouchi Visits Welles, Personally Delivers Note, Opposes Ban on Aviation Fuel Exports</h3>
<p>Washington: Japanese Ambassador to the United States Kensuke Horinouchi personally delivered to US Undersecretary of State Welles yesterday a note formally opposing the US ban on the export of aviation gasoline. Although Horinouchi refused to comment on the content of his meeting with Welles, well-informed sources said that Horinouchi did not mention the issue of requiring licenses for the export of scrap iron and other raw materials. Horinouchi said that Welles did not explain the US point of view. (United Press, 4th)</p>
<p>Washington: It is reported that the State Department is currently considering what strategy to adopt to prevent Latin American countries from re-exporting aviation fuel obtained from the United States to non-American countries. Attention should be paid to preventing re-exports to countries currently at war. (International News Agency, 4th)</p>
<p>Tokyo: The Japan Times recently reported that ten Japanese kerosene companies have raised 5 million yen to form a kerosene import company to prepare to purchase kerosene exclusively from countries other than the United States.

<h3>Labor George Delivers a Speech Calling for Freedom, the Germ of Nazism Spreads to Britain, Hoping the British People Will Be Extra Vigilant</h3>
<p>London - Former British Prime Minister Lloyd George recently delivered a speech calling for the protection of freedom in Britain. He said, "Governments that save the country in times of crisis are often less tolerant of public criticism of the government than administrative organs in times of peace. Special vigilance in times of crisis is a natural trend, for fear that something exists behind our country's politics that could damage the free constitution upon which the country has been founded for hundreds of years. Only eleven months have passed since the beginning of the war, and we have already felt threats to the freedom of our people in all aspects. A small number of independent members of Parliament are resisting these attacks on the basic rights of our country and are working for the true meaning of democracy. All who believe that our country is the only remaining free nation in Europe will surely recognize that our actions are justified. However, the current danger is both significant and growing day by day. The threat of Nazi aggression has not yet become a reality; such attempts by the Nazi Party can be launched at any time. However, the most dangerous Nazi move to invade Britain has already begun: the deadly germ of Nazism, which extinguished freedom on the European continent, has crossed the English Channel and is spreading throughout this democratic nation (Britain). If we do not stop the spread of this epidemic in time, our free system will be destroyed without a trace. Home Secretary Anderson will be responsible for implementing various resolutions to give our country's administrative organs great power, similar to that of present-day Germany, Italy, and the part of France not occupied by Germany. Special tribunals will soon be organized everywhere. These tribunals will have the power of life and death over all residents of the country. These tribunals may not be interfered with by jurors and may impose judgments such as long-term imprisonment and the death penalty. All protections of people's lives and freedoms in trials, such as the Magna Carta and habeas corpus, may be suspended. There is no need to say that there is any chaos, illegality, or rebellion in the country that necessitates such revolutionary changes. However, the government has already shown signs of interfering with the press's legitimate criticism of the government. Even the rights of representatives of the people in Parliament to appeal for amendments to judgments in criminal cases and to review illegal executions have been affected by repeated suppression of public debate. The spy system, which irresponsible people mention in private conversations, is now forming a system similar to Germany's secret organizations. The actions of the old British traitor Tudor may reappear in every village and town in Britain. There is no special speech or action by any legal people's organization in Britain that necessitates such policies of oppression, surveillance, and punishment. During the last war, there were various powerful speeches advocating peace in the country, which even caused various difficulties for the war effort, but there was no record of punishing these peace advocates. MacDonald, Snowden, and Lansbury never let the police interfere with peace advocates. There are currently no signs of anyone undermining the administrative department's war effort anywhere in Britain. There are no organizations hindering the war effort as there were in the last war, nor are there large gatherings demanding an immediate peace as there were in 1917 and 1918. The threat of aggression has united the people, a phenomenon that did not exist in the last war. If we dare to speak out boldly about the various laws and plans used by today's impatient rulers to shackle us, we will say that it is absolutely unreasonable. Nothing can permanently tarnish the morale of our country more than applying this method of an all-powerful country to a country that prides itself on democracy in peacetime. I am just returning from a tour of a part of our country. I have seen that all classes and parties are working together with the government. In fact, all kinds of affairs are requested by these people to exercise power to help stop any aggression against our country. Workers in factories are working hard to assist the government in producing national defense equipment. Farmers in the fields have no complaints about the exceptional obligations imposed on them by the Ministry of Agriculture and are wholeheartedly engaged in increasing food production. They often follow the orders of their superiors with unsuitable tools. The number of volunteer corps in various places exceeds what the government needs, and they have not been given equipment and training by the government. These volunteer corps are all prepared to sacrifice their lives to defend their homeland, and these volunteer corps have no partisan affiliation and no activities outside the law. It would be absurd to say that there is no criticism of the government's measures. There is much criticism regarding the organization of local defense. The lack of proper equipment is bound to cause much comment. Legitimate comments from the people regarding the government's measures will still occur and will be done with all efforts, even at the cost of their lives. Therefore, all punishments and treatments are acts of frustrating the patriotism of the people. The British government has a decisive majority in the House of Commons. It is hoped that they will not use the power of Parliament to adopt plans that are hostile to the spirit of the nation, leading to a fate like that of France. (United Press International, 4th)</p>
<h3>Overture to Japan's Southern Advance Policy: Establishment of "National Policy Company" to Develop Resources on Southern Islands; Expansion of Route under Trusteeship</h3>
<p>Washington - Some observers familiar with the situation in the Far East believe that Japan's stated policy of bringing French Indochina and the Dutch East Indies under its control is nothing more than an attempt to boost domestic morale. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>Tokyo - "Hochi Shimbun" reports that Foreign Minister and Minister of Colonial Affairs Yosuke Matsuoka is also planning to establish a "National Policy Company" to develop resources on the southern islands. This is the first step in the Konoe Cabinet's southern advance policy. It is said that the initial capital of the National Policy Company will be 500 million yen, and its nature will be similar to that of the South Manchuria Railway Company. Its main task is to develop Japan's commerce and industry in the South Seas, and to try to enable Japan to obtain various major material resources. In short, Yosuke Matsuoka's plan is interconnected with the Konoe Cabinet's determination to create an East Asian group to achieve self-sufficiency. (Havas, 3rd)</p>
<p>Tokyo - Japan Airlines is currently planning to expand its airmail route between Japan and the South Pacific trustee islands. In addition to maintaining the existing main line between Yokohama and Palau, it also plans to open two new lines. One runs from Palau via Yap, Truk, and Pohnpei to Jaluit, a horizontal line from east to west, with a total length of 4,200 kilometers. The second runs from Saipan to Truk, a straight line from south to north. Both new lines can be connected to the above-mentioned main line. It is scheduled to officially open on the 20th of this month, with a temporary schedule of one flight per month this year, and is expected to increase the number of flights next year. Saipan belongs to the Mariana Islands under Japanese trusteeship, and Palau, Yap, Truk, and Pohnpei belong to the Caroline Islands. Jaluit belongs to the Marshall Islands, while the American Guam is located between Saipan and Yap. (Havas, 3rd)</p>
<p>Tokyo - Chugai Commercial News reports that according to Japanese officials, although Britain has recently made every effort to expand its economic influence in the Dutch East Indies, Japan's policy of developing commerce in the South Seas will not be affected. As far as Britain is concerned, it has indeed made many efforts in all aspects to promote commercial relations with the Dutch East Indies. For example, the Australian Commonwealth recently signed a new commercial agreement with the Dutch East Indies government, stipulating that the Dutch East Indies should sell coffee, tea, fruits, and other goods to Australia without restrictions. Second, the British government agreed to provide a commercial loan of 100 million Dutch guilders to the Dutch East Indies. Third, the Dutch East Indies ordered cotton worth 4 million Dutch guilders from Britain. All of these prove that Britain is unwilling to sit idly by Japan's southern advance policy and is therefore rushing to catch up. (Havas, 3rd)</p>
<h3>French Press Reviews Peace Plan</h3>
<p>Clermont-Ferrand, France - "Le Temps" recently published an article written by its Rome correspondent, Shanti Song, reviewing the outline of a peace plan that Germany and Italy may propose in the future. It roughly stated: "In the eyes of Germany and Italy, this European war has the characteristics of a social war between nations, that is, the characteristics of a revolutionary war. Therefore, one of the most important issues after the war is to enable European countries to establish governments with vocational groups or totalitarian characteristics, so that European nations can live in harmony politically in the future. In other words, the governments of Germany and Italy believe that Europe, from Portugal in the west to Finland in the east, will be easier to establish a common understanding if it can be guided by the same principles, so as to guarantee peace and gradually reduce armaments, so that the governments of European countries will no longer bear huge military expenses, thereby building a new economic order on the European continent. As for the Soviet Union, it seems that it should be excluded from tomorrow's Europe and need not be taken into consideration." (Havas, 3rd)</p>

<h3>Rumors of Germany, Italy, Soviet Union, and Japan Forming Economic Group to Confront Economic Power of Britain and America</h3>
<p>Rome - The economic group of Rome, Berlin, Tokyo, and Moscow seemed to be under discussion last night, as the Axis countries began to make various preparations to establish a new group in Europe, so that countries would not have to rely on British economic supplies. Reliable sources said last night that the goal of this new quadrilateral group is to create the most powerful magnetic group in history, so as to unite the entire Europe, North Asia, the occupied areas of China, Japan, and Italian Africa, and to control Britain's economic lifeline. The Axis countries believe that in this way, even with the aid of the United States and South American countries, Britain will not be able to compete with the Axis countries' huge resources. Political sources pointed out that Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Molotov's recent speech was an implicit willingness to conduct broader and more important negotiations with the Axis countries. The source also pointed out the importance of the long talks between Japanese Foreign Minister Yosuke Matsuoka and former Ambassador to Italy Bai Wuminfu. According to reports from Rome, Bai Wu will soon accept the most important appointment. It is believed that Spain will also join this group, as Spain has recently made various indications that it is gradually approaching the Axis countries. It is believed here that Spain will bring Portugal into the group. It is also believed here that the Soviet Union may be able to draw Turkey into the group. It is also known that it is solemnly declared here that this huge economic group will not only guarantee the supply of military supplies during wartime, but also supply all the necessities of the people in peacetime.

<h3>German Economic Minister Discusses European Economy</h3>
<p>Berlin - German Economic Minister Dr. Raake's article on the future of the European economy, published on July 25, has been recognized by countries around the world as the most important economic event in recent years. This plan has shown practical effects during this week. Sweden's proposal to use Germany as a clearing center, Finland's request to concentrate foreign trade, and the recent commercial agreements between Germany and the countries of Southeast Europe all show the outline of a new European economic order. Germany is gradually becoming the main driving force for building Europe, but Britain is the opposite. The countries most affected by the British blockade are South American countries. Argentina has lost 40% of its European trade, Uruguay has no market for 25% of its wool, and Brazil and Chile have no way to sell coffee, cotton, rice, fruit, and copper. Britain's shift of transportation to the Atlantic proves that there is no foothold in Europe and the Mediterranean. German troops reported that British ships sunk from the 26th to the 28th reached 220,000 tons. Transportation in London and other commercial ports has been completely stopped. The food supply to Britain has fallen into extreme difficulty. (Haitong, 4th)</p>
<h3>Military Commission Announces Overview of Operations for One Week, July 28 to August 3</h3>
<p>Chongqing - A spokesman for the Military Commission said that the Chinese army on all fronts has fiercely annihilated stubborn Japanese troops on the northern and southern battlefields in the past week (July 28 to August 3), and has recovered many important strongholds, giving the Japanese a major blow. The more important achievements are summarized as follows:</p>
<p>Hubei and Anhui</p>
<p>A part of the Chinese army in Hubei entered Yingshan on the 1st and engaged in street fighting with the Japanese. The Japanese suffered heavy casualties. The next day, another part of the Chinese army attacked Guangshui, and also killed many Japanese. The Chinese army on the west bank of the Xiang River continued to attack the remnants of the Japanese between Jingmen, Dangyang and Yichang for days, and achieved great results. Now Yichang is surrounded by Chinese forces, and the Japanese are trapped in fortifications and cannot move. Since last week, the Japanese in Anhui have transferred troops from Chaoxian to attack Wuwei. The Chinese army retreated to the left and right, and after seeing that the Japanese had penetrated deep into the trap, they began to counterattack and soon recovered Wuwei County. At the same time, the Japanese in Chaoxian risked danger to rescue them. The Chinese army took advantage of the situation to attack the rear of the Japanese, sweep away the remnants of the Japanese, and then Chun Chaoxian, killing many Japanese and seizing many spoils.</p>
<p>Shanxi and Henan</p>
<p>More than a thousand Japanese troops and more than ten artillery pieces in the eastern part of Shanxi, northeast of Jincheng, and the Bagongzhen and Gaodu areas invaded eastward along the Jinling Avenue on the morning of the 27th. The Chinese army repelled them separately. By the evening, countless Japanese troops had been annihilated. Also, a certain Chinese elite unit has been fiercely attacking Wuxiang for days. The Japanese stubbornly resisted in the city and fought fiercely for three days and nights, finally recovering the county seat. As for the Chinese army in northern Henan, they have killed many Japanese in Xiuwu and Jinzuo for days. A part of them besieged Qinyang and are engaging in fierce fighting. The Chinese army in southern Henan once again attacked the South Gate of Xinyang, killing many Japanese troops. They are still attacking fiercely.</p>
<p>Guangxi and Guangdong</p>
<p>More than 2,000 Japanese troops in the vicinity of Suilu and Funan in southern Guangxi have attacked Qulixu in two directions for days, with great ferocity. After being intercepted by the Chinese army, they fought fiercely for several days. The Japanese suffered heavy casualties. After the Chinese army intensified its fierce annihilation for the past two or three days, they have now been completely cleared. As for the Japanese troops entrenched in Shenzhen, southern Guangdong, they have been attacked by the Chinese army several times in the past week, and the Japanese have suffered heavy casualties. In addition, the Chinese army launched attacks in different directions, one attacking south to Xinjie and the other rushing into the Southwest Town, an important Japanese stronghold, posing a great threat to the Japanese troops trapped in Guangzhou. Also, there have been fierce battles on the front line of Chaoshan in eastern Guangdong for days. No less than a thousand Japanese soldiers have died under the artillery fire of the Chinese army. The remnants of the Japanese troops are now in an extremely difficult situation.</p>
<p>Jiangsu and Shandong</p>
<p>After the Japanese troops in northern Jiangsu, who had launched a large-scale attack on the Chinese army from Baoying in three directions, were closely surrounded by the Chinese army last week, they have been fiercely attacked by the Chinese army in the past week, killing and wounding more than a thousand Japanese soldiers and seizing a lot of equipment and ammunition. Also, the fighting along the Tongpei Highway is also fierce. The Chinese mobile army is fiercely annihilating the Japanese troops who are acting recklessly in various places. Two thousand Japanese troops from Xintai and Laiwu in southern Shandong have recently invaded the area east of Laiwu, but have been repelled by the Chinese army separately. Also, the Japanese troops in Zhangqiu and along the Jiaoji Railway have invaded southwest of Zhangqiu for days, but have not succeeded and have been deeply surrounded. It is not difficult to annihilate them completely.</p>
<p>Other</p>
<p>In addition, the Chinese army in northern Jiangxi attacked the Japanese stronghold of Huafang on the eastern road of Jing'an on the morning of the 31st, killing many Japanese troops. At the same time, Songbu, an important Japanese stronghold between Anyi and Fengxin, was once again rushed into by the Chinese army, destroying many Japanese barracks and warehouses. On the 27th, Japanese warships on the sea off Yuyao, Zhejiang Province, attempted to land under the cover of artillery fire, but were completely repelled by the Chinese army with a fierce iron fist. Also, Japanese planes have been attacking Sichuan for days, and many have been shot down and damaged by the Chinese army. These are all important achievements of the past week, and are reported incidentally. (3rd telegram)</p>

<h3>Soviet Supreme Soviet Passes Resolution on Annexation of Lithuania into Soviet Union Amidst Enthusiastic Cheers Throughout the Hall; Lithuanian Deputies Soon to be Elected</h3>
<p>Moscow - The Soviet Union's Federal Council and Council of Nationalities held their third joint session last night. After separate voting, they unanimously passed the bill on the annexation of Lithuania into the Soviet Union. Last night was the third day of the conference. The conference hall was as crowded as on the second day, including scientists, Red Army soldiers, workers, the diplomatic corps, and foreign journalists. When Stalin and his comrades entered the hall, the guests greeted them with enthusiastic cheers.</p>
<p>Acting President of Lithuania Delivers Speech</p>
<p>Then the delegation of plenipotentiary representatives of the Lithuanian Parliament entered the hall, and everyone stood up and cheered. At this point, the conference began to discuss the third item on the agenda. Federal Council President Antuyev introduced Lithuanian Prime Minister and Acting President Yustas Paleckis to take his seat. The Lithuanian Prime Minister immediately delivered a speech in the Lithuanian language, finally requesting the Soviet Supreme Soviet to annex Lithuania into the Soviet Union, and at the same time submitting the declaration on the annexation of Lithuania into the Soviet Union amidst cheers. Then, members of the Lithuanian delegation, poor peasant Petrokas, geologist Mikis, and Cybetas, delivered speeches. They all sincerely requested that Lithuania be annexed into the Soviet Union. The female poet Nilys also recited poems praising Stalin.</p>
<p>Several Districts of Belarus Transferred to Lithuania</p>
<p>At this point, Deputy Ponomarenko, on behalf of the Soviet government, proposed to comply with the will of the Lithuanian people and annex Lithuania into the Soviet Union. Ponomarenko also proposed, on behalf of the Belarusian Socialist Republic, to transfer Svencionys and other areas to Lithuania, as the majority of the population in those areas are Lithuanian. Under Ponomarenko's proposal, the two houses voted separately, and as a result, the bill on the annexation of Lithuania into the Soviet Union was unanimously passed. At the same time, after listening to the declaration of the Lithuanian Parliament's delegation of plenipotentiary representatives, the Supreme Soviet decided to accept the Lithuanian Parliament's request to annex Lithuania into the Soviet Union. As for the Belarusian Republic's government's proposal to transfer Svencionys to Lithuania, the Supreme Soviet also approved it.</p>
<p>Borders of Two States to be Determined Soon</p>
<p>The conference also requested that the Supreme Soviets of the two states quickly determine the exact borders of the two states and submit them to the Soviet Supreme Soviet for consideration. In addition, according to the Soviet Constitution, the Soviet Supreme Soviet decided that deputies from Lithuania in the Soviet Supreme Soviet would be elected by Lithuania. The date of the election will be determined by the Supreme Soviet. The situation at today's meeting fully demonstrates the spirit of national friendship in the Soviet Union. Deputies from both houses will enthusiastically welcome the representatives of the Soviet Union's fourteenth republic. Slogans such as "Long live the Lithuanian people" and "Long live Soviet Lithuania" echoed throughout the hall. (TASS, 4th)</p>
<p>Kovno - In the Lithuanian capital and throughout Lithuania, the Soviet Supreme Soviet's resolution approving the annexation of Lithuania into the Soviet Union has been announced in public places via radio. A parade will be held here today to celebrate, and a grand celebration will be held. (Haitong, 4th)</p>
<p>Kovno - The Lithuanian Cabinet decided yesterday to strip its envoy to the United States, Chaitiga, and its envoy to the United Kingdom, Urbalutis, of their nationality, as the two envoys had condemned Lithuania's annexation into the Soviet Union. The Lithuanian Cabinet also decided to confiscate the property of the two envoys and permanently prohibit them from returning to the country. (United Press International, 4th)</p>
<h3>Soviet News Report Analysis: Molotov's Report</h3>
<p>Today's Soviet News in Moscow published a commentary emphasizing the importance of Molotov's speech. The report stated: "Since several major powers possessing vast colonies were defeated in the war, Europe is now facing an expanding crisis that could easily become a world imperialist war. During this world war, the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union has convened three meetings. People's Commissar and People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs, Molotov, has delivered speeches for the third time. Mr. Molotov's report fully reflects our country's foreign policy and provides a detailed analysis of the international situation. So, what are the key points of this report? We must acknowledge that each report by the head of the Soviet government contains the following three key elements: (1) a clear expression of the Soviet Union's desire for peace, (2) a demonstration of the Soviet Union's victory and forward progress, and (3) an expression of concern for national security and the sacred protection of its borders.</p>
<p>During the sixth and seventh sessions of the congress, the Soviet Union found it extremely difficult to maintain neutrality and peace because the European situation had undergone significant changes in the past four months. The war, which had been dormant for a long time, has been revived by the German offensive. At the same time, new countries have been drawn into the war, and countless governments have collapsed in succession. As a result, the European situation has undergone a major transformation. In this rapidly changing situation, Soviet ships, thanks to the skill of their pilots, were able to continue along their original course. The Soviet people were also able to remain outside the war and continue their peaceful work. This is extremely important because no one can predict how and when the war will end. Moreover, we anticipate that the war will enter an even more brutal phase in the near future. Given the Soviet Union's position in this highly tense situation, it is imperative to further strengthen its security guarantees, and the most important task in safeguarding its borders is to adjust the relationship between the Soviet Union and its neighbors. Regarding this work, great achievements have been made in the past four months. The peaceful resolution of Soviet disputes is one aspect of this. The initiation of the Soviet-Romanian dispute was not the fault of the Soviet Union. The dispute remained unresolved for 22 years until it was finally resolved.</p>
<p>The developments in the Baltic states are also a great success. At the same time, the return of the Bibru region to the Soviet Union not only corrects a historical injustice but also avoids potential border disputes. The financial cliques of Latvia, Estonia, and Lithuania, under the direction of the Soviet Union's enemies, attempted to engage in activities, but these regimes have now been overthrown. This is not only due to Soviet diplomacy, but the main reason is that the people of the Baltic states and the Bibru region, under capitalist oppression, have long yearned to join the Soviet Union to gain liberation. Who does not know the welcome that the Red Army (liberators) received in the Bibru region? At the same time, who does not know that the people of the Bibru region, despite being persecuted by the Romanian authorities, have flocked back to their true homeland? All of this can be confirmed by the speech given by the Bibru representative at the Supreme Soviet Congress yesterday.</p>
<p>The passage of the resolution to establish the Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic by the Supreme Soviet Congress has created a new page in history. Is there any precedent in diplomatic history for such a rapid and peaceful resolution and planning of borders? This kind of achievement can only be obtained by the Soviet Socialist Republics because they all follow the wise national policy of Lenin-Stalin. Every worker can understand and passionately love the Soviet system. This can be demonstrated by the recent events in the Baltic states. The people of these three countries unanimously support the establishment of Soviet power. Without deep understanding, there could not be such enthusiastic and unified sentiments.</p>
<p>The strength of the Soviet Union is not only due to its rich reserves; the Soviet Union values the strength of its people most. Although the strength of the Soviet Union has caused dissatisfaction in some quarters, the increase in national power must make enemies uneasy. Molotov stated in his report: "We do not need the cooperation of certain gentlemen who are dissatisfied with us to carry out our work." This statement is extremely sarcastic. Although these insidious people only express their dissatisfaction in conversations, we do not need to pay attention to them. However, if "dissatisfaction" leads to anti-Soviet actions, the situation will be very different. In this regard, Mr. Molotov has urged the British and American governments to pay attention to their responsibility for the illegal actions in the Baltic region. The United States recently illegally detained cash purchased by the Soviet Union from banks in the Baltic states.</p>
<p>Illegal actions against the Soviet Union may become even more intense in the future. Molotov has briefly stated in his report that, for example, the mysterious planes flying over Baku and Batumi from Iran and Turkey, and the fact that the Finnish authorities are persecuting pro-Soviet elements, all show that anti-Soviet conspiracies are underway. In this poisonous international relationship, we should redouble our preparations to mobilize at any time and monitor everything. In this regard, we must reiterate Stalin's words: "We should always be in a state of mobilization and be prepared to deal with any military attack so that all the enemy's conspiracies cannot be implemented."</p>
<p>Our country is powerful and invincible. This national power is based on the spiritual and political unity of the 193 million people of the Soviet Union. This national power is based on the supreme power of the Red Army. This national power is based on the great policies of the wise national leader, Stalin. In short, no force in the world can shake our country. Molotov's report was transmitted from the Kremlin to the whole world, proclaiming the Soviet Union's power and policies to its friends and enemies who are unable to do anything about it.

<h3>Preparatory Negotiations Held Between Romania and Bulgaria to Discuss the Dobruja Region Issue</h3>
<p>Bulgarian Foreign Minister Popov met with Romanian Ambassador to Bulgaria, Cardel, in Sofia yesterday for a lengthy discussion. Political figures claim that the conversation concerned the initial steps to resolve the Dobruja issue. (Haitong dispatch on the 4th)</p>
<p>Romanian Ambassador to Bulgaria, Cardel, arrived in Sofia yesterday to conduct preliminary negotiations with the Bulgarian government on behalf of the Romanian government. Sources with inside information claim that the Bulgarian delegation will travel to Bucharest this week for formal negotiations, but the date has not yet been announced. Haitong News Agency's correspondent in Sofia learned that Romania's invitation and suggestions prove that Romania is willing to conduct negotiations on the Dobruja issue. It is reported that its proposal was delivered to the Bulgarian Foreign Ministry by the Romanian Minister to Bulgaria on the 2nd. It is expected that the negotiations will proceed smoothly without any difficulties. Bulgaria is currently insisting on its demands and is unwilling to accept any compromise. Regarding the speculations in the Romanian newspapers, Bulgarian officials solemnly rejected whether the city of Silistra on the Danube would be ceded to Romania. The Bulgarian newspapers are very optimistic about the upcoming negotiations. The Savolo newspaper stated that Bulgaria's demands for Southern Dobruja will surely be met. Other newspapers also hope that the resolution of the territorial disputes between the two countries will promote friendly relations between the two countries. (Haitong dispatch on the 4th)</p>
<p>It has just been learned in Sofia that the Romanian Minister to Yugoslavia will come here to negotiate with the Bulgarian authorities on the Dobruja region issue. In addition, the Romanian Ambassador to Italy will go to the capital of Hungary to discuss the issue of Outer Transylvania with the Hungarian authorities. After Romanian Prime Minister Gigurtu and Foreign Minister Manoilescu met with the German and Italian authorities in Salzburg, Austria, they told reporters that they would conduct direct negotiations with the relevant countries regarding all outstanding territorial issues. The current travels of the Romanian diplomatic representatives are likely for this purpose. (Havas dispatch on the 3rd)</p>
<p>German Ambassador to Turkey, Papen, is currently making a short visit here in Sofia. Bulgarian King Boris granted an audience yesterday. Papen then left here on the Orient Express that evening to go to the capital of Turkey. (Haitong dispatch on the 4th)</p>
<p>In Bucharest, the Romanian Iron Guard recently secretly distributed 10,000 leaflets throughout the country, urging Romanians not to surrender to the enemy, to be aware of the current crisis, and to say that since Romania has lost its first line of defense in Bessarabia and Bukovina, Dobruja and Outer Transylvania will also be lost one after another. "We have been deceived by lies at home and abroad. The leaders abandoned the people when the country was in danger. Romanians, remember that those who have created the current ambitious war situation are not your friends and will not help you. Take back your homeland, wake up quickly and work. Time waits for no one, do not give up an inch of national territory." The above leaflets were distributed at the same time as the leaflets of the same nature issued by former Romanian peasant party leader Maniu, and the sentiments expressed in the Romanian newspapers are roughly the same. The popular newspaper said that the military victory that dominates the world should not cause Romania to change its goal of territorial integrity and political and economic independence. The pro-Nazi current affairs newspaper stated that no month should be used as a reason for Romania to make unilateral concessions in order to maintain peace in Southeast Europe. At the same time, leaders of the National Țărănist Party, Maniu, and the Iron Guard are now becoming more and more closely related. It is heard that they have agreed not to participate in the organization of any government unless Maniu forms a cabinet and has the right to choose its members. It is also heard that the people of the country are quickly providing assistance to this movement, believing that it is absolutely necessary to find a way to protect the national territory at present.

<h3>Pravda's Observation: The European War is About to Expand; Increased Relations Between Germany and the Soviet Union Confirmed</h3>
<p>Regarding Molotov's report, Pravda commented: "The speed of France's failure has been explained by Molotov. According to Molotov, France's defeat was not only due to insufficient military preparations, but the important reason was that the French ruling class excessively underestimated the power of the Soviet Union in European affairs. In short, any foolish politicians who have not abandoned the idea of lightly celebrating the Soviet Union should read Mr. Mo's words. Regarding foreign relations, the Soviet Union is still following the policy formulated by the 18th Communist Party Congress. In a word, the Soviet Union is engaged in promoting friendly relations with any country. The recent changes in the European situation have not only not weakened the power of the non-aggression pact, but have also proved the importance of the pact. The Stalin diplomacy policy implemented by the government is very clear and is supported by the entire population of the motherland. Although various parties have done their best to slander the Soviet Union, countless working masses in the world are still very sympathetic to Mr. Shi's foreign policy. We are now on the eve of the great war between Germany, Italy, Britain and the United States. The European war is about to expand and become a world imperialist war. Under these circumstances, the Soviet people must do their best to strengthen the defense forces of the motherland. (TASS dispatch on the 4th)</p>
<h3>Philippine President Advocates Abolishing Political Parties</h3>
<p>Philippine President Quezon firmly advocated the abolition of political parties in the Philippines at an information meeting yesterday. Quezon believes that the existence of political parties is actually harmful and not beneficial. He vaguely stated that there should be no political parties in an ideal country. If democratic politics do not abolish the current political party system, they will inevitably lead to disillusionment. (Haitong dispatch on the 4th)</p>

<h3>German Authorities Strictly Blockade the French Border, Seemingly Preparing to Attack Britain; Hamburg Port Suffers Air Raid and Catches Fire; British Aircraft Bomb French, Belgian, and Dutch Airfields</h3>
<p>The activities of the German troops in the occupied area of France yesterday became an undeniable mystery, because the German authorities strictly blockaded the border between the occupied and unoccupied areas of France. Even diplomats taking cars intending to go to Paris were blocked at the Molin control station. The Siamese Minister and U.S. Navy officers intending to go to Paris were forced to turn back halfway. The Dutch Minister intending to go to The Hague via Paris was also not allowed by the Germans. There are currently no trains running between the two regions, and mail has also been suspended. About one million letters in the unoccupied area are piled up like a mountain, waiting to be sent to the occupied area. The French government announced last night that it had allowed refugees from Belgium, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Alsace, and Lorraine, as well as residents south of the Somme and An rivers, to return to their original residences, but this matter is still awaiting a decision from the German side. Neutral observers believe that the closure of the border is because Germany is preparing to attack Britain on the French coast, and news from the Spanish border also said that German troops are being mobilized in the occupied area of France, so this belief seems reliable. (United Press dispatch on the 4th)</p>
<p>London Gazette stated that yesterday British bombers flew to France, Belgium, and the Netherlands to bomb several airfields. Many hangars and runways were hit. Ground aircraft were also subjected to low-altitude bombing and strafing. Enemy fighters offered some resistance. One British aircraft went missing. At the same time, British aircraft are still systematically attacking military targets within Germany. On Friday night, the main targets of the British attack were oil depots in Emden Hamburg, and Sarsbecken, as well as several airfields. Hamburg and Sarsbecken both caught fire and suffered heavy damage. One British aircraft crashed into the sea while flying back after completing its mission. The British Air Ministry's intelligence office recently stated that the British Air Force attacked the Dutch Schiphol air force port yesterday and destroyed several enemy four-engine aircraft. The German Sarsbecken oil refinery is an important source of gasoline, kerosene, gas, and lubricating oil. It was hit by 30 shells yesterday. British aircraft dropped eight tons of high-explosive bombs on this target. (Reuters dispatch on the 4th)</p>
<p>Enemy planes dropped several bombs in southeastern England last night, and there were no reports of casualties or damage. (Reuters dispatch on the 4th)</p>
<p>The Hague Yesterday British aircraft bombed military-related locations in The Hague for the first time, and there were no losses. Only an old man (72 years old) and a 13-year-old girl were killed by the bombing. One of the old man's servants was injured. (Haitong dispatch on the 4th)</p>
<p>Berlin This afternoon, the German military report stated that the German Air Force conducted reconnaissance over the North Sea yesterday. Last night, German aircraft bombed Stanlow, an important oil port near Liverpool, and there were many fires. British anti-aircraft gun bases on the Isle of Canvey and the goose sea were attacked by air. British aircraft attacked northern and western Germany last night. Although they dropped more bombs than last time, the damage was all in places unrelated to strategy, so the impact was minimal. (Haitong correspondent)</p>
<p>London Last night, officials here stated that the important German port of Hamburg was devastated by bombing, and there were many fires that could be seen from 50 miles away. Recent British bomber attacks have again destroyed the oil depots and airfields around Hamburg. (International dispatch on the 4th)</p>
<p>Hamburg Hamburg suffered its 50th air raid by British aircraft the night before. The British aircraft were unable to soar into the clouds and indiscriminately bombed non-military targets, and encountered intensive fire from German anti-aircraft guns, so they left without dropping bombs. However, many bombs were dropped in the suburbs, injuring two people and collapsing many houses. (Haitong dispatch on the 4th)</p>
<p>Berlin A German military expert released a supplementary war report to the Haitong News Agency reporter, saying that Britain has now lost several more merchant ships, totaling more than 72,000 tons, including three oil tankers, all sunk by our submarines. British propaganda often says that Germany will lack gasoline in the near future to carry out maritime warfare, but this statement is not consistent with the facts. On the contrary, British oil tankers have been repeatedly sunk by our submarines. Due to the German and Italian blockade of various ports, the British Navy's maritime routes are becoming longer and longer, and gasoline supply has become a very serious problem. In addition, our air force is constantly bombing its gasoline depots. For example, on the 2nd of this month, our planes bombed the Thames Haven gasoline depot, and a fire broke out on the spot, and the losses must have been very heavy. Our planes are still attacking enemy military targets, but enemy planes are still targeting our country's civilians as their bombing targets. The day before yesterday, enemy planes raided Kifkohn and destroyed several farmhouses. Military tickets near the area were not damaged in any way, but the residents in the farmhouses were all bombed. (Haitong dispatch on the 2nd)</p>
<h3>German Military Releases Weekly War Situation</h3>
<p>Berlin There were no major battles during the week from July 27 to August 3. The German Air Force continued to bomb various areas on the south bank of the English Channel, and the distance to the British Isles became shorter and shorter. The same team of planes can bomb back and forth several times a day. It only takes a few minutes to fly to the English Channel. Although the German Air Force is not very active at present, the airfields, aircraft factories, and munitions factories in famous British seaports have been bombed by German aircraft. According to news from neutral countries, Britain has now closed the navigation of the Thames River. German aircraft bombed British escort convoys and individual ships with remarkable results. The German Navy also made great contributions. German submarines and motor torpedo boats are also active everywhere. The western entrance and exit of the English Channel, the southern entrance and exit of the Bristol Channel, and the Irish Sea are easily reached by the power of the German naval base and can be directly threatened. Germany sinks an average of between 60,000 and 97,000 tons of British ships every day. The losses suffered by the British naval battle are also very heavy. Although British aircraft bombings of Germany are becoming more and more intensified, they mostly target German civilians, such as Hanover, Hamburg, and other places without military targets, but British aircraft frequently bomb them, and Germany will give an appropriate reply. The air war situation seems to be becoming more and more tense. In the Mediterranean, British shipping is greatly obstructed by Italy. Malta has lost its effectiveness. Gibraltar has been repeatedly bombed by Italian aircraft, and the British fleet in the port of Alexandria is often attacked by Italian aircraft, and the losses of ships are very heavy. Regarding the war in foreign territorial waters, the British giant auxiliary cruiser "Alcantara" (22,209 tons) was defeated by a German warship and seriously injured and fled into the port of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Germany is now keeping silent about the development of the war situation because Germany is now in a position to decide when to launch it. (Haitong dispatch on the 4th)</p>
<h3>European War Chronicle (1) - A Diagram of German Military Strategy</h3>
<p>Previously, this newspaper published a selective translation of "Failure of a Mission: Berlin 1937-1939" by Sir Nevile Henderson, the former British ambassador to Germany, to inform readers about the background of this European war. This war is almost a year old, and the land battles on the continent have long since come to an end, while the war between Britain and Germany remains unresolved. We have collected a wealth of materials, all first-hand reports from European and American journalists and writers. Now, we have selected the most outstanding ones to translate and publish in this newspaper under the title "European War Chronicle," which will be published daily. The table of contents is disclosed below:</p>
<p>(1) A Diagram of German Military Strategy</p>
<p>(2) A Survey of the Western European Battlefield</p>
<p>(3) The Self-Description of a British Air Force Warrior</p>
<p>(4) The Retreat of the British and French Allied Forces</p>
<p>(5) The Reasons for France's Defeat</p>
<p>(6) The Eve of Hitler's Order for a General Offensive</p>
<p>(7) The Refugee Story of Norwegian Female Writer Sigrid Undset</p>
<p>This is the first article, titled "A Diagram of German Military Strategy," written by Lionard Nason, a military reporter for the American Look magazine and a well-known American military affairs writer. During the last European war, he served in the 76th Field Artillery Regiment of the U.S. Army and wrote extensively about the last European war. The original text is translated and recorded below.</p>
<p>Hitler's mechanized forces launched a general offensive in Western Europe with unstoppable momentum, astonishing the world. However, to military experts familiar with the actual situation of the British and French Allied defenses, this victory achieved by the German blitzkrieg tactics was not surprising. What was surprising was that the British and French Allied forces were so helpless against these anticipated tactics.</p>
<p>General writers and commentators, without thinking, rashly praised Hitler as a military genius and spread rumors that the German army had some secret new weapons, which were all deceptive. The strategy used by Hitler this time did not escape the confines of German strategists of the past. For hundreds of years, this strategy has been fundamentally consistent. The only difference is that Hitler was able to concentrate and utilize the fastest and most destructive force in history.</p>
<p>The strategy used by the British and French Allied forces in this European war focused on hiding behind the Maginot Line and the extended line along the Belgian border to the North Sea, adopting a defensive posture. The border area between Belgium and Germany was also fortified with strong defenses, seemingly allowing for complacency. However, this Maginot extended line on the border between France and Belgium was only a field defense work, not a permanent defense work. This kind of defense work was nothing more than bunkers connected by trenches, with tank defense lines built from railway tracks, and the entire line was protected by barbed wire obstacles.</p>
<p>The weakness of this defense line was east of Sedan, at the junction of the Maginot main line with the French extended line and the Belgian extended line. Therefore, the defense of Sedan was extremely important. If this point was breached, the side of the Maginot main line would lose its stronghold, and the German army could encircle the rear, invade French territory, and then march triumphantly along the Aisne and Marne rivers directly towards Paris.</p>
<p>Sedan had the Ardennes Forest as its natural barrier. The forest area stretches from Namur to the Luxembourg border, with mountains and rivers crisscrossing, and the Meuse and Semois rivers extending through it. This natural barrier had the potential to be an impregnable pass. It was extremely difficult for motorized units to fight in this rocky jungle, and the defenders could also use it as cover to avoid air raids.</p>
<p>When the German army invaded the Netherlands and Belgium, those familiar with the terrain immediately thought that the gateway to Sedan had been blocked. Neutral observers all believed that the French army must have been stationed in the Ardennes Forest area to protect Sedan. However, four days later, the German army had already crossed the Vierre River on the northeast side of the Ardennes Forest and occupied Sedan, advancing at a speed of 45 miles per day. This speed was unprecedented in history.</p>
<p>This proves that the Ardennes were not garrisoned, Sedan was not defended, and the Maginot Line had to change its strategy in a battle and retreat. The day after Sedan fell, the French authorities announced that they would abandon positional warfare and switch to mobile warfare. The German army's new tank corps was able to engage the Allied forces in the open field. The Allied forces were completely unprepared for this kind of mobile warfare, while the German army had been conserving its energy and was invincible. The outcome had already been predetermined.</p>
<p>The principle of all strategies is to avoid the real and attack the weak, that is, to concentrate superior forces to attack the weakest point of the enemy. This strategy generally requires dividing the army into two major corps, one being a holding force and the other being an encircling force. The holding force first makes a feigned attack in front of the enemy's position. Once the enemy's line of sight is drawn by this feigned attack, the encircling force bypasses the enemy's side and attacks the rear. The famous Schlieffen Plan of Germany adopted this principle.</p>
<p>Simply put, this plan stipulated that five armies would invade France, the First Army to the Fifth Army, arranged in a line from north to south. The First and Second Armies were responsible for the encirclement, taking the road through Belgium to attack Paris, while the Third, Fourth, and Fifth Armies were responsible for holding the French army along the line from La Fère, Rethel to Verdun. After the encircling force advanced to Paris, it turned eastward, making the French army face the enemy on both sides (see Figure 2).</p>
<p>The German army adopted this plan when it invaded France and Belgium in 1914. At the beginning of the war, the German army originally hoped for a quick victory. However, after the German army attacked Amiens, it was far behind schedule, and the supply of military supplies could not keep up. The German Chief of Staff, Moltke the Younger, abandoned the Schlieffen plan to attack Paris and instead adopted a strategy of annihilating the main force of the French army. The German encircling force then turned to attack the southeast.</p>
<p>After the German army reached the east of Paris, the French army saw that the enemy's right flank was empty and knew that there was an opportunity to take advantage of it. They divided their forces and encircled the German army's right flank from the northwest. At the same time, the garrison in Paris rushed to reinforce the holding force along the Marne River. At this point, the German army was in a predicament of being attacked on both sides and had to implement a general retreat. The French army was able to turn defeat into victory in the Battle of the Marne. (See Figure 1)</p>
<p>The strategy used by Hitler in this European war was also the same. However, this time the German army broke through from Sedan and cut the French army into two sections; one was trapped in the Maginot Line, and the other was cut off on the west bank of the Meuse River. This strategy used two encircling forces, called overlapping encirclements.</p>
<p>This plan stipulated that the First and Second Armies would attack Paris from the north, the Third Army would advance from the northeast, and the Fourth Army would encircle from the east. In Belgium, the German army used three army corps of superior forces to attack the British and French isolated army, while the Fourth Army encircled from the east in the Ardennes. The Fifth Army held the defenders of the Maginot Line in Lorraine.</p>
<p>The advantage of this overlapping encirclement strategy lies in the fact that when any one army is forced to retreat, the other armies can attack the enemy forces pressing the retreat. In other words, the five German armies can all respond to each other and use superior forces to pressure the Allied forces in Belgium or the main force of the French army at any time and place. When the British and French Allied forces were trying their best to resist the offensive of the German Third and Fifth Armies, the German First and Second Armies were already carrying out a flanking offensive. If the Allied forces wanted to reinforce the flanks to resist this flanking offensive, the German Third and Fifth Armies had already taken advantage of the situation. This situation was truly a case of losing sight of one thing while attending to another.</p>
<p>As for the factors of the German army's success in tactics, it lies in the use of tanks and maintaining the liaison between the various armies.</p>
<p>Before the launch of the German blitzkrieg, there were two schools of military thought in the world. The British and French believed that tanks were an auxiliary weapon, and their main function was to assist infantry. The method of combat was to first bombard with artillery, then attack with infantry, and then pursue with tanks when the enemy retreated. In the early stages of engagement between the two armies, tanks were often used as reserves, and their speed was often controlled by the speed of the infantry, traveling two miles per hour in the open field. Over the years, the German side had long regarded tanks as the main force, while infantry had retreated to an auxiliary position.</p>
<p>It was difficult to determine who was right and who was wrong in these two theories before the war, but the right and wrong were immediately apparent when the two armies engaged in combat. However, the Allied forces already knew that they had made a big mistake, but they still did not try to remedy it. Although General Gamelin, the commander-in-chief of the Allied forces, was immediately dismissed, this mistake was not due to a day or two and could not be blamed on Gamelin alone.</p>
<p>While the Allied forces were replacing their commander and trying their best to find a defensible position, the German army had already followed the Schlieffen Plan and advanced directly from Sedan to the line of Rethel, Laon, and La Fère. Four days after the breakthrough at Sedan, the key to the Allied defense line was already in the hands of the German army. Since then, the German motorized forces immediately advanced to the English Channel on one side and occupied Paris on the other.</p>
<p>The liaison between the German armies was maintained by radio. The planes in the sky, the tanks on the ground, and the mechanized infantry were all equipped with radios, communicating with the headquarters at any time and place. The orders from the headquarters and the reports from the captains were all transmitted by radio. The advance, accommodation, and supply of the various armies were all directed by radio. The marching was rapid, yet still orderly. The encircling force rushed 200 miles in two and a half days. How could it not be victorious?</p>
<h3>Germany May Send Paratroopers to Defend French West Africa; Dakar Port is Full of German Spies</h3>
<p>London - The London Times reported today that Germany is likely to send aircraft and paratroopers to the port of Dakar in French West Africa. The port is also a base on the air route between Europe and South America, and is the closest point in Africa to South America. Recently, a Polish ship left the port of Dakar without the permission of the French authorities. The captain of the ship told the British authorities last week that the French would detain the ship and that the port of Dakar was full of German spies. It is still unknown whether the British government will take any action to prevent Germany from transporting paratroopers to French territory. (International Telegram, 4th)</p>
<h3>Rumor: Spain is About to Enter the War; A Large Liner Appears in Brazil</h3>
<p>Rio de Janeiro - The Spanish transatlantic liner "Conte Verde" suddenly appeared in the outer port here yesterday, causing speculation that Spain may soon join the European war. The ship was originally scheduled to sail directly from Montevideo to Tenerife without stopping at Brazilian ports. Officials on the ship refused to explain the reason for its unexpected arrival here. The "Jornal do Brasil" said that the ship's "arrival at Guanabara Bay is due to Spain's imminent entry into the war." Naval officers on board the ship claimed that the ship was avoiding the seizure of its cargo by British blockade ships, believing that Spain would soon enter the war. (United Press Telegram, 4th)</p>
<h3>British Air Force Attacks Italian Derna Three Times; Italian Aircraft Bombs Sudanese Airfield</h3>
<p>Cairo - Yesterday, the British Air Force attacked the city of Derna on the coast of Italian Libya three times, bombing the harbor and airfield there, with great effect. Bombs hit ships, aircraft on the ground, and docks. British aircraft also conducted reconnaissance over Dessie in Abyssinia, many of which were piloted by French pilots. According to a British Air Force communiqué, a large squadron of Blenheim aircraft directly hit a large ship during the first raid on the harbor of Derna, and another was almost hit. During the second raid by British bombers, bombs hit a dock and a ship. During the third raid, British bombers attacked the harbor and airfield, dropping bombs on aircraft parked on the ground. The harbor docks were also bombed, and a ship was almost hit and is believed to have been seriously damaged. All British aircraft returned safely to base. (Reuters Telegram, 4th)</p>
<p>London - Rome Radio broadcasted an Italian communiqué stating that the Italian Air Force bombed a Sudanese airfield today and dropped bombs on a railway junction in Haifa. The communiqué also stated that in the recent battle of Gimbel, Italian troops captured the flag of the 6th Battalion of the Royal Rifle Regiment. It also said that the damage from the British air raid on Derna in Libya was minimal. The communiqué finally acknowledged that an Italian submarine had not returned to base. (Reuters Telegram, 4th)</p>
<h3>Netherlands to Implement Clothing Rationing System</h3>
<p>Amsterdam - It was announced here yesterday that the Netherlands will follow Germany's example and implement a clothing rationing system to ensure the supply of clothing to the people, especially the poor. As in Germany, a voucher will be given to those with low salaries who need to purchase inexpensive clothing. Children under the age of three can purchase clothing without a voucher. It is understood that the clothing voucher will be implemented from August 12. (Haitong Telegram, 4th)</p>
<p>Cairo - According to an announcement from London, since the start of the war in Libya, the British have suffered 20 dead and missing, and 10 wounded. The Italians have suffered 20 dead and wounded each, and 472 captured. The Middle East Command stated that the aforementioned 20 Italian deaths and injuries each refer specifically to the Italian corpses buried by the British and the wounded Italian soldiers captured alive by the British. The number of Italian prisoners of war has now reached 818. The number of Italian casualties totals several hundred. The Italian army also suffered the loss of soldiers, guns, and tanks in its adventurous action to recapture the Capuzzo fort. According to ground and aerial observers, enemy corpses are piled up around the positions, many unburied, and destroyed tanks from motor transport units are scattered everywhere. Those captured admit that the hospitals are full of wounded. (Reuters Telegram, 4th)</p>
<h3>Governor-General of Tunisia Inspects Various Cities</h3>
<p>Tunis, French North Africa - The newly appointed Governor-General of French Tunisia, Vice Admiral Esteva, recently visited the cities of Gabes, Médenine, and others, and was warmly welcomed by the local French and indigenous communities. (Havas Telegram, 3rd)</p>
<h3>Swiss Scholar Proves New Chemical Element, the 85th</h3>
<p>Bern, Switzerland - Dr. Minder, a Swiss national scientist, has, after years of research, proven the existence of the 85th element in chemistry, containing chlorine properties. Dr. Minder has now named it "Helvetia" (transliteration). (Haitong Telegram, 4th)</p>
<h3>Churchill Warns the Nation Not to Relax Vigilance; The Possibility of a German Invasion Has Not Been Eliminated</h3>
<p>London - Prime Minister Churchill recently issued a statement saying that even at this time, the possibility of a German invasion of our country has not diminished in the slightest. All of our people should remain vigilant and not relax in the slightest. As for the rumors spread abroad that Germany may not carry out a "blitzkrieg" against us, this is purely German propaganda. Their intention is to induce us to neglect our vigilance. The people must not fall into their trap. From this statement by the Prime Minister, it can be seen that the government is constantly on the alert. In addition, there is another phenomenon worth noting, namely that in peacetime, every year on the summer bank holiday (i.e., August 4th and 5th), a large number of Londoners would go to the seaside to escape the heat, crowding the streets. However, at this time, there are very few. The reason is that the majority of the city's residents have already been evacuated, and those who remain here are all in important positions and cannot leave even for a short time on holidays. In short, on August 5th, all factories will break with traditional habits and work as usual. This tense scene is unprecedented in the last 69 years. (Havas Telegram, 3rd)</p>
<h3>General de Gaulle Criticizes the Vichy Government</h3>
<p>London - General de Gaulle, leader of the Free French National Committee in England, broadcast a message from London to France and French territories last night, saying that not all parts of France followed the "old men of Vichy." Hitler's roar and Mussolini's barking have frightened these old men. However, what I can tell the people tonight is that this is not the case everywhere. Many parts of France have now risen up with the determination to preserve French territories. Today's holders of governing power in the French colonies are fulfilling their duty if they refuse to apply the dishonorable armistice terms. (Reuters Telegram, 4th)</p>
<h3>Swedish Ship Siken Sinks</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden - According to a report from the Swedish consul in London, the Swedish ship "Siken" (1,972 tons) has sunk in the Atlantic Ocean. The crew of 20 have been rescued and will be sent to a British port. The "Siken" is a ship from Helsingborg. (Haitong Telegram, 4th)</p>
<h3>Brazilian Delegation Presents Sword to Franco</h3>
<p>Madrid - After arriving here, the Brazilian delegation presented a sword to Spanish Head of State General Franco. They have now departed for the capital of Portugal. (Havas Telegram, 3rd)</p>

<h3>Commemoration of the Songhu Resistance Approaching; Authorities Adopt Strict Security Measures; Armed Control to Maintain Order in View of Repeated Terrorist Acts Within the Concession</h3>
<p>The raging Songhu War has passed in a flash for three years. The third anniversary of "August 13th" is approaching. The concession authorities in this city, seeing that the situation within the concession is becoming more complex, have no choice but to increase security measures. Furthermore, in view of the repeated terrorist acts within the concession, they will adopt even stricter special security measures than in the past. According to sources, the concession authorities and the Shanghai garrison are planning to make the security situation more thorough, and the cooperation between the military, police, and business community will be even closer.</p>
<p>Military, Police, and Militia Mobilize Simultaneously</p>
<p>At that time, in addition to the police officers of the two concessions going out on patrol, the garrisons of various countries in Shanghai will also mobilize simultaneously. In addition to the entire White Russian unit of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps, all volunteer members from various countries will also be called up for duty. The two concessions will be completely placed under armed control. This special security measure will be more thorough than those implemented in the past, and the duration will also be longer, possibly continuing for three days or even five days.</p>
<p>Strict Curfew and Prohibition of Gatherings</p>
<p>According to a notice from the authorities, the Shanghai Municipal Police will strictly enforce nighttime curfew hours from August 5th to 15th. All citizens are requested to pay special attention. Anyone found loitering on the streets between 12:30 a.m. and 5:00 a.m. without a pass will be arrested and detained. At the same time, the French Concession is taking similar steps. These measures are issued for the anniversary of the Shanghai War. From today, the authorities will also prohibit all gatherings, parades, associations, and other activities. In addition, due to the tense situation, it has been decided to start special security measures earlier on the 9th. All police officers in the two concessions will mobilize simultaneously, patrolling the roads and inspecting pedestrians. Armored car teams, the American Business Corps, and patrol teams of American, British, French, and Italian forces of various countries, as well as male and female inspectors, will be dispatched at any time. As for the closure of various roads, bridges, and unnecessary alleyway traffic, it is not intended to close them except on the 13th. These security measures are all scheduled to be lifted at midnight on the 15th, but if the situation is good, the date of security measures may be shortened in advance.</p>
<p>Japanese and Puppet Police Guard Land and Water Transportation</p>
<p>The Japanese puppet regime, fearing that the Chinese guerrillas will launch an offensive during the commemorative day, is extremely panicked. In recent days, they have been building defensive fortifications in the four suburbs of Shanghai and sending more Japanese and puppet troops to garrison them. They are paying close attention to the areas around Beixinjing, South Huangpu, and Zhabei Railway. As for the bridges in the Hongkou District, such as Zhonghong Bridge, Lihong Bridge, Waihong Bridge, Yokohama Bridge, Sikaizi Bridge, Jiaxing Road Bridge, and Tilan Bridge, the Japanese garrison troops on the bridges have all resumed their posts.</p>
<h3>Tense British-Japanese Relations; Concern Among Overseas Residents in Shanghai; Desire to Know the Truth About the Tragic Death of Cox; Indians in Shanghai Being Orchestrated to Form an Association</h3>
<p>Since multiple British nationals in Japan and Korea were arrested by the Japanese authorities, the British government has also detained two Japanese nationals in London according to defense regulations. The British government has taken a firm stance and rejected the Japanese protest. After the news spread, British and Japanese nationals in this city are paying close attention to the development of this case and are paying attention to the increasingly deteriorating British-Japanese relations. However, they are all maintaining strict silence on this matter and refusing to express any opinions. After Walker, the Far East General Manager of Reuters, left Shanghai for Japan last week, he participated in Cox's funeral in Tokyo and investigated the details of Cox's tragic death on the ground. A letter was received yesterday stating that he is scheduled to leave Japan and return to Shanghai within this week. At that time, he will give a detailed report on the Cox tragedy and the Japanese arrest of British nationals, so all sectors at home and abroad are eagerly awaiting him, hoping to understand the truth.</p>
<p>Japanese Shipping Lines Prohibit British Passengers</p>
<p>According to Japanese sources, Japan has prohibited British passengers from boarding any shipping lines traveling to Japanese ports. This move by the Japanese is actually a ban on British people landing in Japan, which makes relations between the two countries even worse. According to a reporter from the Da Guang News Agency, the Japan Mail Steamship Company and others in this city did not sell passenger tickets to Japan yesterday because it was a Sunday holiday.</p>
<p>Indians Have Organized an Association</p>
<p>Recently, the chairman of the Japanese Indian Association, Sahal, came to Shanghai from Japan, planning to instigate the 2,000 Indians staying in Shanghai to engage in anti-British movements. At 5:30 p.m. yesterday, a meeting was held at the Astor House Hotel in Hongkou to discuss the organization of the "Indian Association in China." The meeting resolved to elect a chairman, secretary, treasurer, head of the propaganda department, and persons in charge of organizing volunteers, and to establish an organization committee, or set up a general association in Shanghai, with branches throughout the country. According to a reporter from the Pingming News Agency, the purpose of the association is to promote friendly relations between the Indian people and China and other countries, and to promote the public opinion of the Indian people. At the same time, we believe that the association was purely established for anti-British purposes, but it claims that the Indian people are indeed engaged in the independence movement, sparing no effort. This is a desire for self-help. This should be understood.</p>
<h3>After Qian Hongye's Murder, a Successor is Being Selected</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Evening Post says that it is heard from responsible sources that although a successor has not yet been selected after the recent murder of Qian Hongye, the Criminal Court President of the First Special District Court of Jiangsu, the criminal proceedings in the Special Court will not be greatly affected. As soon as the judicial authorities in this city determine the successor, the name of the successor will be announced, because there are many judges in the court who are proficient in criminal law. It is also learned that the late President Qian was highly respected by the Chongqing authorities, and Chairman Chiang sent a telegram of condolence to President Qian's family. It is also heard that the Chongqing side will decide to issue a public statement praising him and allocating funeral expenses.</p>
<h3>Bizarre Report Regarding Japan and Place – Discovery of a British Spy Network – Assertions Made with Such Certainty As If They Were True – But the Reason for Their Activity Was Not Explained</h3>
<p>The Continental Daily reports that the Japanese-language Continental News in this city yesterday (the 3rd) carried a piece of news claiming that a large British spy network operating in Shanghai had been discovered, and elaborating on the details of its work. Although the newspaper claimed that this spy group had extended its activities to Nanjing, it did not explain why this group was allowed to continue its activities without interference. The newspaper relayed the following information:</p>
<p>The Leader of the British Group in Shanghai</p>
<p>is named Scott, and his chief assistant is named Li Pinren (transliteration). In addition, there are 20 Chinese, most of whom are former students who studied in the UK, secretly gathering information about the "Nanjing Government." The group is divided into four departments: Political, Military, Economic, and Social Affairs. Their espionage activities are divided into eight sections, focusing on Soviet political, economic, military, and Communist activities in China, Japanese activities, the KMT-CPC cooperation, anti-Japanese resistance, and the activities of the Nanjing government. Other matters such as</p>
<p>the Actions of Various Countries in China,</p>
<p>the actions of Chinese political parties, the state of pro-Japanese groups, and the situation of Japanese state-run companies are also of concern. The newspaper went on to list the names of thirteen people sent to Shanghai to engage in activities by the British group, and the names of four people sent to Nanjing. It claimed that these people are all espionage experts who manage the entire spy network, enabling them to obtain detailed reports on Japan. Almost all of the cultural groups and various enterprises supported by the British are engaged in important espionage work. The two offices they have set up in Shanghai and Nanjing are only part of a spy network spread across the Far East.</p>
<h3>Zhenhai Battles Burned Down Houses – Four to Five Thousand – Japanese Warships Indiscriminately Bomb Two Islands – Japanese Troops Retreat Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Ningbo sojourner groups in Shanghai continued to receive telegrams from Ningbo yesterday. (1) Xu Fu, a member of the Central Relief Committee, happened to be in Zhenhai for medical treatment during the Zhenhai battle. He went to Yong on the previous day for medical treatment. When asked about the extent of the losses and the relief efforts in the Zhenhai battle, he said that four to five thousand houses in the urban and rural areas were burned down. The refugees were displaced and had nowhere to turn, and the situation was extremely dire. He has discussed with Commissioner Xu of the Sixth District and, in addition to telegraphing Chairman Huang of Zhejiang Province, he has also telegraphed Chairman Chiang and the Central Relief Committee, requesting funds for relief and post-war rehabilitation.</p>
<p>Sounds of Japanese Warships</p>
<p>(2) At 6:12 AM on the third, two Japanese warships anchored outside the Zhenhai port fired twelve shots towards Jiangnan. At 9:15 AM, they continued to fire two shots towards Jiangnan. At around 10:15 AM, a Japanese warship was spotted near Hengshan, anchored on the waters of Qijiao. At 2:10 PM, a Japanese warship sailed from the north outside Zhenhai port and is now anchored in the waters of Ligang, with no unusual activity. At 3:05 PM, a Japanese warship was also spotted in the waters of Shipu, sailing south from the north at around 5:00 PM. (3) On the morning of the second, Ningbo heard loud cannon fire, like a string of pearls, all coming from outside the Zhenhai port. According to official inquiries, it was learned that Japanese warships outside the territorial waters twice fired artillery at our fortresses. The first time was at 8:11 AM, when a Japanese warship anchored in the waters east of Hudu Hill suddenly fired eight shots at the southern bank of the Yangtze River. The second time was at 11:20 AM, when it continued to fire four shots. However, there were no targets, and the shells landed in the wilderness, causing no damage.</p>
<p>Japanese Troops Retreat</p>
<p>According to reliable information from the shipping industry, the two islands of Qiliji and Huangmang outside the Zhenhai port were occupied by Japanese troops landed by Japanese warships on the 17th of last month, and the Japanese flag was raised on the islands as a base for invading Zhenhai. After the county town of Zhenhai was recaptured by the Chinese army, the Japanese troops on the two islands boarded warships and retreated yesterday. The two islands have now returned to tranquility, and the Qiliji lighthouse continues to shine as usual, guiding ships.</p>
<h3>Gaodeng's Trial Voyage to Zhejiang Sea – Suddenly Suspended – Japan Permits Resumption of Shanghai-Fujian Shipping Reportedly for Other Purposes</h3>
<p>The office of the Gaodeng steamer of the Lulin Shipping Company suddenly announced yesterday afternoon that it had received a telegram from eastern Zhejiang saying that Japanese warships were still harassing the Zhejiang sea area, and the trial voyage of foreign ships was still prohibited. Therefore, in order to avoid danger, the shipping company had postponed the Gaodeng steamer's trial voyage, which was originally scheduled for 3:00 PM today, indefinitely. As a result, many of those who had purchased Gaodeng tickets from the shipping company rushed to the ticket office yesterday afternoon to return their tickets. As the resumption of shipping between Shanghai and Zhejiang is unlikely to be realized in the short term, a shipping merchant told reporters that the Japanese side's permission for foreign ships to resume shipping between Shanghai and Fujian was not without reason. Most of the Japanese goods entering mainland China are smuggled in through the coastal areas of Fujian and Zhejiang. Since the maritime transport of Fujian and Zhejiang was blockaded, these Japanese goods could not be transported in, causing significant losses to Japanese merchants. Therefore, they resumed the Shanghai-Fujian route in an attempt to allow Japanese goods to continue to be smuggled into the mainland. As for the method of importing Japanese goods, some unscrupulous import and export merchants tear off the original trademarks of Japanese goods, replace them with Chinese trademarks, and also stamp them with words such as "Completely Chinese Goods." However, according to reporter's inquiries, the local authorities of Fujian Province and the Chamber of Commerce of Qihai City have already paid close attention to this matter and will severely punish it once discovered.</p>
<h3>Japanese Bridge in Hongkou – Drunken Wandering</h3>
<p>According to the Continental Daily, it has been reported from Hongkou that Japanese residents in Shanghai who are found wandering the streets drunk at night will be deported back to Japan. The Japanese consulate police have arrested 32 such Japanese this month and sentenced them to four days in prison. The Japanese authorities are doing this to remind the Japanese people of the "current situation of their motherland." Although some Japanese residents in this city are serving the public and restraining themselves, some Japanese people have forgotten the difficulties of the soldiers on the front lines.</p>
<h3>Xu Yongzuo and Xu Maotang – Soon to Regain Freedom – But Must Complete Bail Procedures</h3>
<p>Xu Yongzuo, an accountant in this city, and Xu Maotang, manager of the China Remittance Bank, have been detained in the Guangci Hospital on Jin Shenfu Road for many days since they were arrested by the Japanese side together with the French Concession police. It is rumored that the reason for the arrest of the two Xus was related to the patriotic donations at the beginning of the Shanghai war. However, after investigation, there is no evidence of any criminal behavior. According to sources close to the two Xus, the French Consul has agreed to allow them to regain their freedom, but they must complete bail procedures. The families of the two Xus are now trying hard to obtain the conditions for regaining freedom, because their arrest was indeed innocent.</p>
<h3>International Trade Improves – Foreign Exchange Management Successful – Preparing to Stabilize Balance of International Payments – Black Market Speculation Gradually Suppressed</h3>
<p>The Chinese government has successfully managed foreign exchange, the foundation of foreign exchange is being consolidated, the legal foreign exchange rate remains unchanged, foreign trade has improved, the balance of international payments is gradually being balanced, the issuance of legal tender has increased but the reserves are still sufficient, the Shanghai black market foreign exchange is stable, speculators can no longer use their skills, and legitimate import and export merchants have benefited greatly, which has won the support of Chinese and foreigners.</p>
<p>Indirect Management of Foreign Exchange Period</p>
<p>From the start of the July 7th Incident to March 13th of the 27th year (1938), the main measures during this period were to reduce the amount of legal tender reserves and prevent capital flight, in order to protect the foreign exchange fund. The important measures were: (1) Measures for stabilizing finance during extraordinary times; (2) Implementation of a new remittance system; (3) Promotion of small denomination subsidiary coins; (4) Strict restrictions on domestic remittances; (5) Restrictions on the transportation of banknotes. The above measures were very effective in consolidating the financial foundation. Although there was no direct management of foreign exchange in name, indirect management of foreign exchange was actually implemented.</p>
<p>Formal Management of Foreign Exchange Period</p>
<p>From January 14th of the 27th year (1938) to June 30th of the 28th year (1939), during this period, the unlimited supply of foreign exchange to the patrol ports was stopped. Those who needed foreign exchange had to go through application and approval procedures. For export foreign exchange, for designated export goods, the foreign exchange earned from the sale of goods had to be sold to the national bank. The important measures were: (1) Examination of import foreign exchange; (2) Sale of export foreign exchange; (3) Second stabilization of finance and new remittance system. Thus, the management of foreign exchange entered a formal stage.</p>
<p>Strengthening Management of Foreign Exchange Period</p>
<p>From July 1st of the 28th year (1939) to March 14th of the 29th year (1940), the main measures during this period were to expand the scope of foreign exchange settlement for export goods in order to increase foreign exchange income. At the same time, in order to reduce the use of foreign exchange, the import of non-essential goods was prohibited in order to save foreign exchange expenditure. For goods that were not prohibited, import merchants who had legitimate needs could still apply to purchase foreign exchange to meet the supply of domestic goods. The important measures were: (1) Receiving the difference in foreign exchange settlement for export goods; (2) Implementation of the prohibition of import goods; (3) Application for foreign exchange to pay the balance fee.</p>
<p>Adjusting Management of Foreign Exchange Period</p>
<p>From March 15th of the 29th year (1940) to the present, during this period, there were no changes to the application for foreign exchange purchase. However, the foreign exchange settlement for export goods was changed to fourteen categories of goods, and the commercial exchange rate between legal tender and pound sterling was suppressed, so that the main goods could increase exports, replenish the foreign exchange base, and stabilize the black market foreign exchange. The main measures were: (1) Revising the measures for the settlement and transportation of goods; (2) The exchange rate between legal tender and pound sterling was suppressed to four and a half points. In addition, the government bore the bank's handling fees for settlement.</p>
<p>Trade Improves, Import Surplus Decreases</p>
<p>A reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency learned from related parties yesterday that the management of foreign exchange is closely related to foreign trade. With the successful management of foreign exchange, foreign trade will naturally improve. For example, in the first half of this year, the total value of foreign trade was 966,039,000 yuan for imports and 934,585,000 yuan for exports, with an import surplus of 31,454,000 yuan. Compared with the same period last year, imports increased by 245,455,000 yuan, exports increased by 522,875,000 yuan, and the import surplus decreased by 277,600,000 yuan. Compared with the same period the year before, imports increased by 53,790,000 yuan, exports increased by 610,980,000 yuan, and the import surplus decreased by 88,250,000 yuan. The balance of international payments is therefore gradually being balanced.</p>
<h3>The Armor Arrives in Shanghai Today – Final Voyage</h3>
<p>The US Navy transport ship Armor, originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on the 4th of this month, will be delayed until today (the 5th) due to encountering a hurricane and heavy fog in the North Sea. It will carry American soldiers who have served in the Far East for two full years back to the United States to continue their service. The transport ship has been sailing at sea for more than 20 years, and the US Navy Department has decided to decommission it. Therefore, this trip to the Far East is its last voyage.</p>
<h3>Western Newspapers Discuss Consular Body Meeting – Facts Listed Argue Inability to Improve Situation</h3>
<p>Yesterday's English-language Greater Shanghai Weekly published an article by the well-known British commentator Mr. Woodhead criticizing the recent meeting of the Consular Body held to discuss the Shanghai Municipal Council's appeal for cooperation in stopping terrorist acts. The article began by stating that on the day the meeting reached its final resolution, several murders occurred, including the assassination of Mr. Mesra, Chairman of the Russian Emigrant Committee, the abduction of Mr. Shen Jingzhou, manager of the Yi Tai Hing Coal Briquette Company, and Mr. Ni Lan Shen, local editor of the News. In fact, the above cases were definitely not committed by the Chongqing government. The Consular Body meeting resulted in the passage of a resolution condemning the impermanence of terrorist acts and urging the Shanghai Municipal Council to do its best to suppress terrorist acts and maintain the peace of the Settlement. At the same time, it suggested that the police authorities should strengthen their forces and strengthen cooperation with all parties, such as the French Concession Police, the Japanese Military Police, the Police Department of the Japanese Consulate, and the "Police Bureau" of the puppet municipal government. All these suggestions are very pleasing to the ear, but in reality they have no effect. The police authorities are well aware of the source of terrorist acts, but they are unable to effectively suppress them due to lack of strength. A few hours before and after the Consular Body meeting, Shanghai Municipal Council police officers were disarmed by the Japanese Military Police while arresting thieves on Yu Yuan Road, and traffic on Haig Road was stopped due to the opening of a gambling den. What is the meaning of the proposal for joint cooperation? The situation is so serious, why bother about whether the letter from the Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council to the Consular Body is appropriate or not? In short, the actions of the Consular Body have not reduced the seriousness of the current situation.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Cultural Circles Commemorate Lu Xun's Sixtieth Birthday Yesterday – Lu Xun Devoted His Life to the Great Cause of the Nation – Now that the War of Resistance is About to be Completed, He Should Smile in His Grave</h3>
<p>The late literary giant and ideological mentor Lu Xun (Zhou Shuren) passed away four years ago at the age of fifty-six. This year marks the sixtieth anniversary of his birth. Zhou devoted his life to fighting, and his contributions to the literary and ideological circles will be immortal. Mr. Cai Yuanpei once respected him as the founder of China's new culture. His contributions to national independence and freedom, and his promotion of social evolution, are truly outstanding. As the war of resistance enters its fourth year, the cultural circles, in order to commemorate the sage, initiated the celebration of Zhou's sixtieth birthday. Zhou's birthday was originally on the third day of the eighth month of the lunar calendar. In order to facilitate the unification with the Gregorian calendar, with the consent of Zhou's wife, Ms. Xu Guangping, it was changed to August 3rd of the Gregorian calendar, and a ceremony was held yesterday (the 4th) at 10:00 AM.</p>
<p>Commemoration Ceremony</p>
<p>The commemoration ceremony was held in the auditorium of an academic organization on Lafayette Road. About 200 people attended, mostly from the literary, educational, and youth student circles of this city. The venue was decorated simply and solemnly. On the commemoration stage, there was a small portrait of Zhou taken on his fiftieth birthday. A bottle of flowers was placed on the altar, and there were several flower baskets under the stage. The commemoration ceremony began at 10:00 AM, and the ceremony was as follows: (1) Opening of the meeting; (2) Paying respects to Zhou's portrait; (3) Chairman's speech; (4) Expert's speech; (5) Zhou Jianren, Zhou's third younger brother, narrates Zhou's life; (6) Ms. Xu Guangping's reply; (7) Poetry recitation by five young poets; (8) Closing of the meeting.</p>
<p>Life Contributions</p>
<p>The chairman's speech analyzed in detail Zhou's contributions and success to the nation, and cited Dr. Sun Yat-sen as an example. The contributions of Dr. Sun to the national revolution and Zhou to the ideological revolution have had an immortal impact on the Chinese nation. In the expert's speech, the martyrdom spirit of Zhou's support for truth and justice, and the vast and profound educational significance he made to the Chinese youth were analyzed in detail. The conclusion was that the best way to commemorate Zhou was to advance the war of resistance and the revolutionary cause. Zhou devoted his life to advocating resistance against Japan and striving for national freedom. If Zhou knew that the war of resistance was about to be completed and victory was in sight, he would smile in his grave. Zhou Jianren's report on Zhou's life and Ms. Xu Guangping's reply were both very alert. The commemoration ceremony ended at 1:00 PM.</p>
<h3>British Consulate Recruiting Office – Resumes Registration – British Overseas Chinese Sign Up Enthusiastically</h3>
<p>One week ago, the new conscript recruitment office attached to the British Consulate in Shanghai was so busy due to the enthusiastic participation of British overseas Chinese in registration that it announced a temporary suspension of registration for one week, so that it could calmly carry out physical examinations of a large number of registered service personnel, and at the same time give the overworked staff a chance to rest. It has been learned from the British authorities that the office will resume registration today (the 5th) from 9:00 AM to 2:00 PM. A large number of British overseas Chinese who intended to join the Royal Air Force of the United Kingdom last week but failed to do so can go to register tomorrow. The office was established two weeks ago, and British overseas Chinese responded very enthusiastically.</p>
<h3>A New Hurricane Rises Again in the Pacific Ocean</h3>

<h3>White Russian Leader Assassinated – Police Disclose Clues – Murderers' Vehicle From Hongkou – Mrs. Mesra to Return to Shanghai for Funeral Today</h3>
<p>The Continental Daily reports that Mr. Mesra, Chairman of the Shanghai White Russian Emigrant Committee, was shot and killed by a Chinese assassin on Nanyang Road on the morning of the 2nd. The murderer is believed to have come from the north bank of the Suzhou Creek, because according to the police, the vehicle with license number 1797, which the murderer was riding, belongs to a Korean car rental company in Hongkou. Mrs. Mesra, who was recuperating in Japan, was shocked by the bad news and sent a return telegram, saying that she would arrive in Shanghai on the 5th to handle the funeral arrangements. Mr. Tsurumi Ken, a spokesman for the Japanese Embassy in this city, had previously denied that the assassination of Mr. Mesra was instructed by the Japanese authorities, and said that once the "Shanghai White Russian Emigrant Association" is organized, the White Russian passport will be issued by this new group. It is found that the Japanese side formed this new group and planned to take over the work of the White Russian Emigrant Committee led by Mr. Mesra. Therefore, Mr. Mesra's position as the administrative head of the White Russian emigrants was opposed by the new group. The Japanese side once invited Mr. Mesra to work in the new "Association", but was rejected. The reason why the new "Association" could not be established is believed to be due to Mr. Mesra's refusal.</p>
<h3>Water and Electricity Company Strike – Final Stage – Labor Party to Decide on Steps Today – Jinmen Employees Continue to Work as Usual</h3>
<p>All employees of the British-owned Water and Electricity Company and the workers of the old and new factories will take a stance towards the employer at 9:00 AM today and make a final appeal. Half a month has passed since the go-slow strike occurred in the company, and all users are deeply concerned about this matter and hope that the opinions of both parties can gradually converge and return to normal. According to employees speaking to reporters of the Pingming News Agency, they will once again express the grievances of the labor party to the company today. If the company authorities still do not understand, the employees will demand that the company authorities settle their savings and one year's dismissal fee, and the salary for July.</p>
<p>Jinmen Strike</p>
<p>All employees of the Jinmen Hotel at 104 Jing'an Temple Road have made a request to the employer to improve their treatment in view of the increasing cost of living, as reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is learned that the hotel has been open for nearly two months. The employees, about 190 in total, have received considerable education, and the monthly salary they receive is generally 14 yuan. The tips given by customers must be handed over to the accounting room, and then the accounting room will extract and distribute them. Therefore, the monthly treatment is quite meager. All employees, in view of the high prices at this time, find it difficult to maintain their lives with their monthly income. As a last resort, they made four requests to the authorities the night before: (1) Maintain the minimum cost of living; (2) Abolish the system of unequal salaries for the same work; (3) Employees shall not be dismissed without cause; (4) Publicize the accounts of business tips. The employer did not respond at the time, causing a go-slow strike to occur for a while. However, in order to maintain the convenience of all customers, the labor party continued to work as usual yesterday morning while negotiating with the employer again. The two parties are still at a stalemate.</p>
<h3>Suzhou City Gates – Still Not Open</h3>
<p>Suzhou's city gates were closed at 8:00 AM after the puppet Wuxian County Governor Guo Huiji was assassinated on the morning of the 31st of last month, and traffic inside and outside the city was cut off in the afternoon. It has been five days now. Yesterday, travelers who went to Suzhou to buy train tickets at the North Station were still rejected, because the city gates of Suzhou have not been fully opened. Traffic outside the city was restored at 5:00 PM on the first, and traffic inside the city was restored on the morning of the second. The city gates are opened for two hours a day, allowing only elderly people to enter and exit. The Japanese puppet military police searched house to house, but found nothing. According to the Japanese side, the original state will not be restored until clues are obtained.</p>
<h3>Spring Tax Revenue – Total Amount Intercepted – Jianghai Customs is the Largest</h3>
<p>After the tax revenue of the customs in the occupied areas was intercepted, it was stopped from being remitted to the Chinese government and deposited in the Japanese Yokohama Specie Bank instead. According to the Xin Sheng News Agency reporter who recently learned from the customs, the customs revenue not remitted to the government in the spring of the 29th year (January to April) was: (1) Import tax revenue of 156,255,077 Customs Gold Units, accounting for 90.63% of the total revenue of all customs in the country; (2) Export tax revenue of 172,975,850 yuan, accounting for 65.69% of the total revenue of all customs in the country.

<h3>Japanese "Hengchan Company" – Encirclement of Wusong Civil Fields – Reportedly Paid Half in Cash</h3>
<p>After the Japanese Hengchan Company encircled 60,000 mu of civil fields in Wusong, according to sources, the company has been paying half in cash and half in company bonds since last year. It is also claimed that the company bonds have an annual interest rate of 6% and will be repaid in fifteen years. In the past, when the full amount was paid in company bonds, the Taihe Silver Company would provide a loan of 60% of the face value. Now, the company pays half in cash. However, the farmers in that area have no land to cultivate and have suffered greatly.</p>
<h3>Two Young Girls Sold Repeatedly – Claimed to Be Willing to Work as Dancers – Male and Female Offenders Arrested One After Another – Prosecution for Interfering With Family</h3>
<p>Zhang Wang, a woman from Changshu, is 48 years old and lives at No. 5, Yuanheli, Qinglian Street, Nanjing. In the 23rd year of the Republic of China (1934), she bought Zhang Guiying (13 years old this year) from her hometown as her daughter. In May of this year, due to economic difficulties, she sold her daughter to Liu Wang (40 years old, from Nanjing, living at No. 173, Caishi Street) for 100 yuan. Liu Wang actually forced her daughter to prostitute herself, and she opened the Yu Qiaqing Road Oriental Hotel Room 413, and the guest Yang paid 40 yuan for the virginity, but the girl</p>
<p>Could Not Bear the Abuse</p>
<p>complained to Gu Ni (24 years old, from Pudong, Tangle White), who lived with her. Gu Ni actually had bad intentions and falsely claimed to teach the girl to dance. On the 13th of last month, at about 6:00 AM, she secretly led the girl to Xu Changming's home at No. 3, Lane 100, Wenzhou Road, where Xu hid her at Cao Wu's home at No. 133, Gansu Road. Cao Wu feared being exposed, so she transferred the girl to Wu Chen's home at No. 32, Hengmaoli, Minti Ni Yin Road. Zhang Wang found out about this. According to the report to the French Concession Police, Detective Shao Guanrong was sent to Room 3, Yongxing Inn, No. 183, Caishi Street to arrest Gu Ni and the prostitutes Rong Zhuxilin and Chen Zhong.</p>
<p>According to Confession</p>
<p>The remaining defendants were arrested one after another, and Qian Chenghua (14 years old, from Changzhou, bought by him to work as a dancer) was also found at Wu Chen's home. They were all taken to the police station for investigation. It was considered that the plaintiff Zhang Wang was also suspected, so they were all sent to the Criminal Court No. 1 of the Special Court No. 2. Lawyer Yao Zhao of the Police Station filed a public prosecution against the defendants for the crime of interfering with the family. Judge Liao continued the trial in court the day before yesterday. When questioned, all the defendants denied the charges, and the two victims claimed that they were willing to work as dancers and were not forced. After checking the words in court, because further investigation was still needed, it was ordered to postpone the trial for another week. All the defendants were not allowed to post bail and were all detained.</p>
<h3>Notorious Thieves Hire a Truck to Arrive – All Caught</h3>
<p>The home of Chen Jiyuan, a local man at No. 8, Lane 310, Tangyou Road, was entered by a large group of bandits at 2:30 AM one day, who climbed over the wall from the drying platform, took out a pistol, and threatened Chen not to make a sound. They robbed the five households of tenants including Gu Pufang and Liu Gu, and stole cloth, clothes, bicycles, and other items worth 7,555 yuan. They rushed out of the door and loaded the stolen goods onto a pre-hired truck, just as they were about to drive away. Detective Wang Cheng of the Gordon Road Police Station and Inspector Xu Decheng received a tip-off and rushed to the address with Western detectives to arrest them. The notorious thieves Xu Jinke, Yuan Yigen, Hu Guangyu, Li Shenglin, Cao Fugen, Liu Yuebao, Wu Deshan, Yang Zheyuan, and others, all from Jiangbei, were arrested one after another, and most of the original stolen goods were seized.

Lawyer Zhang Tianyin of the Police Station stated that the defendants in this case gathered in a room at the Bingtong Commercial Hotel on Aiwenyi Road to discuss the robbery and hired a truck in advance, parked near the hotel. He requested a postponement, stating that there were still many accomplices who had not been arrested. Judge Jiang questioned them and ordered them to be detained again. At that time, two Jiangbei women, Wang Xushi and Li Jinhua, were eavesdropping in the courtroom and were discovered by the Chinese and Western detectives, who took them back to the police station and tried them together with Xu Jinke and others.</p>

<h3>The Chemistry Institute of the Academia Sinica's Laboratory Building Completed in Kunming; Construction and Equipment Costs Total 130,000</h3>
<p>The new laboratory building of the Chemistry Institute of the National Central Research Institute outside Xiaoximen in Kunming has now been completed. The institute specially invited visitors on July 1, led by the institute's staff to visit the optical laboratory, organic chemistry laboratory, theoretical chemistry laboratory, factory library, and distillation room, and provided detailed instructions. After the visit, Ren Hong delivered a report on the construction process in the library, distillation room, and other places, stating briefly that after the war of resistance, the institute relocated to various places in the rear to avoid losses. The chemistry institute's laboratory moved to Kunming in the 27th year via Hong Kong and Vietnam. At that time, it was planned to build a new laboratory building to facilitate research. Construction began in the 28th year and has now been completed, costing more than 57,000 yuan for construction and more than 70,000 yuan for equipment, totaling more than 130,000 yuan. In addition to the allocation of more than 60,000 yuan from the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Fund for research institute equipment, the remaining expenses were covered by the institute's savings. Although the scale of this laboratory building is small, it can also be used for research. Before the completion of the laboratory building, colleagues never slackened in their research work, and they will intensify their efforts in the future to achieve success. As for the future goals of the institute, firstly, for those who are not staff of the institute and need chemical testing, the institute has established rules and is willing to help sincerely. Secondly, the institute is built in Kunming for permanent use, and plans to make more efforts for the frontier industry during the war of resistance, so as not to fail the greatest significance of the institute's relocation to the rear. After the report, the meeting was adjourned.</p>
<h3>Fujian Provincial Government Handles Summer Vacation Training Classes for Elementary School Teachers; Provincial Government Establishes Methods for Training, and Supplementing Hygiene Expenses for Public and Private Secondary Schools</h3>
<p>In order to standardize the training subjects for the summer vacation training classes for principals and teachers of central schools and national schools organized by various counties and districts during the summer vacation, the Fujian Provincial Government has specially formulated the following guidelines to be followed: 1. The principle is to be jointly organized by neighboring counties and districts, with the administrative supervisors of each district overseeing the formulation of detailed plans. 2. Expenses are to be covered by the reserve funds of each county and district. 3. In addition to the previous decisions for training of the same nature, four new subjects are added: (1) Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings and the President's speeches, (2) National Education, (3) The theory and practice of local autonomy, (4) The province's national economic construction. 4. After the completion of the training, a summary table and grade report must be submitted, and a graduation certificate must be prepared and sent to the Department of Education for verification and printing. 5.

<h3>Another Upset in the Second Group of the Hezhong Cup; Shangxing Suffers a Miserable Defeat to Nanyang Yesterday; Nanyang Overtakes and Wins; First-Grade Paramount Defeats Qifan Greatly</h3>
<p>The Hezhong Cup Charity Basketball Tournament has seen many upsets in the past month or so, such as Shanghai Youth's defeat to Qunyi, Youlian's defeat to Qifan, Shanghai Youth's loss to Liangxi, and yesterday's defeat of Shangxing in the second group to Nanyang. Nanyang initially lost to Moore and Paramount. After the great victory over Zhongyi, they defeated Tianxing. Yesterday, in the first half, they reversed the situation and defeated the powerful Shangxing, creating another miracle in the Hezhong Cup. At the beginning of the game, Zhang Banglun of Nanyang was trapped and made no progress. On the Shangxing side, the points were very evenly distributed. Zhou Jun and Ye Zuyao were very threatening, so Shangxing was better than the first half with 22 to 16. After changing sides, Nanyang suddenly became excited. Zhang Banglun exerted great pressure and scored every time. Han Longhai was even more unrestrained. The Shangxing basket was repeatedly broken, and the entire Shangxing army suffered a complete defeat. Nanyang overtook and won with 53 to 42. The outcome of the first-grade Paramount and Qifan game was predetermined. However, the situation in the first half was very tense. At the end of the first half, Paramount took the lead with 35 to 28. After changing sides, Qifan showed signs of decline. Qian Xi Zhang's active posture in the first half had been curbed. Qu Xilin and Zhang Zhihua stood out instead. Unfortunately, Paramount's strength was sharp, and Qifan could not do anything. In the end, Qifan lost to Paramount again with 50 to 80.</p>
<h3>Wenbin Charity Ball Second Round Bracket Set; Sanyi Fahua Achieves Victory Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Wenbin Cup Charity Ball Tournament continued yesterday, with more spectators than before. In the first match, Fahua versus Tietui, the first half created a tense situation. The offense and defense in the second half were strong. Fahua finally scored another goal and won the final victory with two to one, advancing to the second round. In the second match, Sanyi versus Zhenhua, Sanyi was the incarnation of the former Xiaozhonghua, and their technology has reached its peak. Zhenhua was also not weak, so both sides' defense was like a golden city, and it was difficult to break through. Therefore, the atmosphere in the stadium became white-hot. When the first half ended without any gains, the audience was even more obsessed, thinking that both sides were boosting their morale, but in reality, their strength was at the same level. The offense was sharp, and the defense was solid. Seeing that the statutory time was about to end, there were still two goose eggs. The soldiers on both sides became even more vigorous. Sanyi finally scored a goal in the last five minutes by Liu Ziquan with the determination to break the boat, and finally won the final victory with this precious goal, joining the three teams of Lianyi, Samsung, and Fahua to advance to the second round. After the game, the captains of the four teams drew lots together to determine the second round order. The results are recorded as follows:</p>

<h3>Reasons for Revising the Commercial Exchange Rate</h3>
<p>— Sun Liyu</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance issued an order, effective August 1st, revising the commercial exchange rate of the Bank of Communications and the Central Bank of China from 7 'ban shi' to 4.5 'ban shi'. Those unaware of the true situation believed that the government was devaluing the legal tender, showing signs of inflation. Speculators seized this opportunity to stir up trouble, forcefully acquiring foreign exchange, causing the exchange market, which had been stable for several weeks, to contract again. The British exchange rate tightened from 3.859375 'ban shi' to 2.8125 'ban shi', and the US exchange rate also contracted from 5.96875 yuan to 5.8125 yuan. However, the Central Bank's official rate remained at 2.5 'ban shi' per shilling, proving that the government had no intention of devaluing the currency. The revision of the commercial exchange rate was a temporary expedient, and there were other reasons, the most important of which are approximately the following two:</p>
<p>(1) Recently, in order to raise funds for construction projects, the government issued the 29th year construction gold bond. Article 3, Section 3 of the British gold bond regulations stipulates that "those who pay in legal tender to purchase may convert it into British gold or US dollars according to the commercial exchange rate set by the Ministry of Finance." However, according to the Shanghai black market exchange rate, each yuan of legal tender was worth less than 4 'ban shi'. After deducting 30% for the exchange difference between the inland and Shanghai, each yuan of inland legal tender could only purchase 2.7 'ban shi' of British exchange. If the government allowed inland people to purchase gold bonds based on the previous commercial exchange rate of 7 'ban shi', then each yuan would gain an undue profit of 4.3 'ban shi'. Now is a time when national finances are in deficit, and the government cannot condone people making huge profits. Therefore, the commercial exchange rate was specially lowered to 4.5 'ban shi' to avoid losses. However, even at 4.5 'ban shi', inland people purchasing gold bonds can still profit 1.87 'ban shi' per yuan, and Shanghai people purchasing can also profit 0.7 'ban shi'. Using this difference to encourage the purchase of bonds is enough to make the bond sales achieve good results. Observing the enthusiastic supply of Chinese banks in the past two days while speculators have been trying to acquire foreign exchange, it can be proved that the banks are willing to subscribe to gold bonds with this difference.</p>
<p>(2) For the export goods of Free China, all the 14 types designated by the Ministry of Finance, such as tung oil and tea, must first settle foreign exchange. Before July of last year, settlements had to be made according to the Central Bank's official rate. After July, settlements were made according to the commercial exchange rate of 7 'ban shi'. The government used this to subsidize merchants and encourage exports, which was quite effective. However, the black market exchange rate contracted again later, recently stabilizing at around 4 'ban shi', a difference of 3 'ban shi' from the commercial exchange rate of the Bank of Communications. Dishonest merchants could settle at a lower exchange rate when their goods were exported from Shanghai and other places, gaining more legal tender, so smuggling became rampant. For example, tung oil exported from Shanghai in the first half of last year was only 376,416 yuan, but in the same period this year, it increased to 13,213,036 yuan, an increase of 34 times. Another example is tea, which in the first half of last year was only 2,367,405 yuan, but this year it increased to 24,512,150 yuan, an increase of 10 times. The increase in exports of these three commodities certainly has other reasons, but it cannot be denied that it includes a large number of smuggled goods. Now that the government has reduced the commercial exchange rate to 4.5 'ban shi', making it not far from the black market, state-owned export companies in the interior can also raise the price of goods purchased from merchants and stop smuggling. Therefore, this measure can achieve great results in encouraging exports and preventing goods from flowing into the occupied areas.</p>
<p>The above two points are probably the reasons why the government reduced the commercial exchange rate this time. However, some people believe that this method is enough to suppress the downward trend of the black market exchange rate and embolden bullish speculators. This statement seems reasonable, but it ignores the variability of the commercial exchange rate. This revision is a temporary expedient. If the situation of legal tender improves in the future and the black market exchange rate rises, the commercial exchange rate can also be raised accordingly without any obstacles. Moreover, according to the current black market exchange rate, there is still a difference of 0.7 'ban shi' from the commercial exchange rate for British exchange. Furthermore, according to the Shanghai US-British exchange rate of 3.66 yuan, the commercial exchange rate for US exchange is about 7 yuan, which is also about 1.2 yuan different from the black market. It is a big question whether bullish speculators are willing to bear this risk. Since the expansion of the European war, the exchange rate has been particularly loose, prices have plummeted, the import of foreign goods has become increasingly difficult, the actual demand for foreign exchange has been reduced to the minimum, and overseas remittances continue to flow in, the supply is still very strong, and the exchange market trend is still loose. If speculators want to take advantage of the revision of the commercial exchange rate to stir up trouble, they will surely suffer serious consequences.</p>
<p>Editor's Note: Mr. Sun has made a correct and profound analysis of the reasons for revising the commercial exchange rate. As for the consequences, from the reporter's point of view, it may be the prelude to the elimination of the black market for foreign exchange. Since the legal commercial exchange rate is close to the black market exchange rate, it will be easier for the Ministry of Finance to maintain the black market than in the past. When there is a huge difference between the official rate and the market rate, in fact, the Central Bank can only sell, but cannot buy, because export drafts will inevitably flock to the black market. The reason why the Central Bank's exchange application and approval system failed in the past was this reason. Now that the difference between the two is small, if the Ministry of Finance intends to eliminate the black market, it is easy to overcome this difficulty. Therefore, if speculators want to take this opportunity to stir up trouble, as Mr. Sun said, they will surely suffer serious consequences. Please carefully consider Mr. Sun's article.</p>
<p>Which is more important, the Far East or Europe, in the world policies of the United States and the Soviet Union?</p>
<p>What impact will the difference in importance have on the economic world?</p>
<p>Regarding the answer to this question, we have received two special articles from international problem experts Chu Yukun and Aina. 93 articles were submitted by various parties. Most of them also answered other questions. Judging from the envelopes used, the occupations cover industry, commerce, medicine, education, law, and even the film industry, which shows the development of political minds and the rising level of culture in all walks of life. The main points are published below, and the rest are briefly indicated by the names according to the opinions of each person.</p>
<p>Aina (Special Article)</p>
<p>Let me talk about the United States first. Let me quote a Reuters telegram from July: "The newly appointed Secretary of the Navy Knox and Secretary of the Army Stimson have respectively presented their opinions to the Naval and Army Committees of the Senate, emphasizing that the new front line of the United States in the future is in the Atlantic." Knox also said: "Because the country's future is fraught with great crises, I have reconsidered my past advocacy of a tough policy toward Japan. The United States may be forced to choose between the threat in the Atlantic and the threat in the Pacific. For the sake of the United States, it may be better to avoid creating dangerous situations at the same time." From these two statements, the weight of the Far East and Europe in the United States' world policy is clearly visible. Europe is the center of the capitalist world, and the United States is the last fortress of world capitalism. There is no doubt that the United States' foreign policy is based on its policy toward Europe. Therefore, as soon as the European war broke out, the United States immediately passed a new neutrality law that was beneficial to the Allied Powers; while China's War of Resistance has been going on for three years, she has been helping China to some extent on the one hand, and she has been selling military materials to Japan on the other. Of course, we do not deny the irreconcilability of the contradictions between Japan and the United States, but its Far East policy is undoubtedly subordinate to its European policy.</p>
<p>As for the Soviet Union, we can also say that the problem of Europe is much more important than the problem of the Far East. The war among the European powers and the anti-Soviet ideas give the Soviet Union a more serious threat than Japan. However, because its political and economic organization is fundamentally different from capitalist countries, its foreign policy is also the opposite. The basic principle of the Soviet Union's entire foreign policy is to uphold peace and friendship among countries. This is no different in Europe and the Far East. In the Far East, the Soviet Union's policy of assisting China's War of Resistance is unchanged. This is fundamentally different from the diplomatic policy of assisting China to a limited extent to confront Japan's monopoly of the entire Chinese market. The Soviet Union does not need colonies or semi-colonies, nor does it need a market for exporting capital. The purpose of its aid to China is to help China defeat aggression, seek its own independence and liberation, and get rid of the imperialist and financial shackles imposed on it by the capitalist world.</p>
<p>Chu Yukun (Special Article)</p>
<p>The Soviet Union spans Europe and Asia, and occupies a very important position on the world political stage. It has a kind of "stabilizing force" for both Europe and the Far East. Although the United States is geographically located in the Americas, it is far away from Europe and the Far East. However, because its domestic prosperity depends entirely on foreign markets, and Europe and Asia are the places where its interests lie, once changes occur in Europe and Asia, they will affect the interests of the United States. Therefore, the United States is very concerned about the politics of Europe and Asia. Whenever the interests of the United States are threatened in either continent, the United States will definitely come out to intervene and maintain them. In short, the interests of the United States and the Soviet Union are spread throughout Europe and Asia. On the international political stage in Europe and Asia, the United States and the Soviet Union are two important roles. The policies they adopt cannot be ignored by anyone. As for which is more important, Europe or the Far East, in the foreign policies of the United States and the Soviet Union? This question should be answered separately.</p>
<p>First of all, as far as the Soviet Union is concerned, it occupies a pivotal position in Europe, enough to influence the development of the European situation. After the signing of the German-Soviet non-aggression pact, Hitler dared to send troops to Poland, and France lost the assistance of the Soviet Union, which led to its failure. This is one proof of this. Since the European War, the power of the Soviet Union has gradually expanded. Not only has most of Poland been incorporated into the territory of the Soviet Union, but also the countries along the Baltic Sea have been incorporated into the Soviet Union. Therefore, the Soviet Union's western border is extremely consolidated, and it is prepared for emergencies; this is the second point. The Soviet Union did not throw itself into the vortex of the European war this time, and its strength has been preserved. Germany and Italy and Britain and France are all exhausted. Even if Germany defeats Britain again, Hitler will not dare to act rashly against the powerful Soviet Union. Therefore, the Soviet Union's position in Europe is consolidated and prepared for emergencies. However, this is not the case in the Far East. In the future, the Soviet Union's goal should be in the east rather than the west.</p>
<p>Secondly, the United States, Hitler's victory is certainly a major threat to the United States, but since France surrendered and begged for peace, although Britain wants to resist stubbornly, it is already powerless. Even if the United States helps with all its strength, it will not help; this is the first point. The United States has purely economic interests in Europe and Asia. Whether in Europe or the Far East, if its interests are threatened, it will definitely take defensive actions, regardless of each other. It can be seen from the expansion of the US Navy and the desire to build the so-called "two-ocean navy"; this is the second point. The US policy towards Europe has changed, and the "Monroe Doctrine" may be revived. The issue discussed at the recent Pan-American Conference, in essence, is how to stop Germany's power from extending into the Americas; this is the third point. Therefore, from my personal point of view, since the United States has not succeeded in Europe, it is possible to concentrate all its efforts on dealing with the Far East. The defense of Guam is not to be said, and the embargo on iron and oil to Japan further shows that the attitude of the United States towards the Far East is becoming stronger and stronger day by day. I heard that the date of action is not far away.</p>
<p>No Distinction, Waiting for an Opportunity to Act</p>
<p>Mao Bangci</p>
<p>The interests of the United States and the Soviet Union in Europe and Asia are really not important; because peace cannot be divided. However, their policies, "perhaps depend on which is more serious, the danger in Europe and Asia? Which is more urgent? Then decide which comes first and which comes later? However, this order only exists at the beginning of the outbreak; then it may be related to each other and expand at the same time? Because of this, what kind of impact will the economic world suffer? It is not difficult to imagine. It is nothing more than the destruction of international trade by naval warfare, and the international exchange market is also in chaos because of this; as a result of the war countries strengthening wartime economic control, the supply and demand of materials in various places have also changed greatly. If the war drags on, the world's currency circulation will inevitably expand. This lays the foundation for the post-war currency trend. Generally speaking, if the victory belongs to Britain and the United States, the post-war world currency will not change much compared to today. On the contrary, that's not certain.</p>
<p>Ye Xin</p>
<p>Soviet Russia is now having problems in Europe, so it will not act in Asia. However, the Soviet Union will never coordinate with Japan. Since Japan does not dare to challenge him, he is happy to be temporarily conservative.</p>
<p>The United States is in a different situation because there is a blood relationship between Britain and the United States, and there are historical feelings; the consequences of the Anglo-German war are extremely close to his national fortune. As for the Far East, since Japan does not offend him, he does not have to look for trouble.</p>
<p>This is their subjective mentality, but when the objective situation changes, he will naturally not be allowed to take extraordinary measures. But it is still difficult to determine at present. However, there is one point that can be raised for discussion: will the Anglo-German war be like the Sino-Japanese war? Will it also enter a stalemate stage? If the European and Asian battlefields are both stalemated, then the United States may first solve the Far East problem, so as to move eastward and help Britain control Germany. The Soviet Union's activities in Europe should be limited to not increasing Germany's jealousy, and when it is appropriate, he will naturally have to settle accounts with Japan? But his actions will probably be one step slower than the US action?</p>
<p>In addition, Mr. Jin Dongren and Mr. Lu Yuwen have similar opinions.</p>
<p>The Psychology of Beauty and the Soviet Union in Form</p>
<p>Wang Xiao</p>
<p>The United States hopes to maintain the balance of power in the world and maintain its leadership position; the Soviet Union hopes to socialize the whole world and maintain its leadership position.</p>
<p>The United States' Far East policy is also to maintain the balance of power, so its aid to China, both moral and material, is important. This is a fact; and it is indifferent to Japan, and adapts to its diplomatic policy.</p>
<p>The United States has indirectly participated in the European war, while the Soviet Union is absolutely strictly neutral, and uses this time to consolidate its national strength.</p>
<p>Considering that the coastline of China has been completely blocked, (including the Yunnan-Burma Road...) the Soviet Union can engage in aid to China because the West has become more consolidated. The Chinese government attaches importance to and builds the Northwest Highway, and the United States has reduced various exports (such as oil and iron recently) due to its urgent need for war preparations... then the proportion of the Soviet Union's economic influence on China will increase day by day.</p>
<p>Considering the business negotiations between Britain, Germany, Bulgaria, Iran, Afghanistan... and other European countries with the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union's economic influence in Europe will be strengthened day by day, while the United States can maintain South America and North America, but it cannot but maintain contact with the Soviet Union. (The recent negotiation on the renewal of the commercial treaty was initiated by the United States).</p>
<p>Li Junfan</p>
<p>First, let us talk about the position of the United States in Europe. In fact, although the Allies remained neutral in the war against Germany, they did their best to assist the Allies with both economic and war equipment. It is undeniable that the United States can be said to be one of the belligerent countries, and its position is very clear. As for the Far East, it is enough to stop the aggressor, because Japan's economy depends on the support of the United States. As for the Soviet Union, its maintenance of its current relationship with Germany is actually due to the inability of the former Allies to cooperate with it, and it was forced to do so. Therefore, if Britain can make concessions today, the Soviet Union is very willing to contact it, and if the time comes, victory will be in hand! In the Far East, although it has assisted our country greatly, according to its consistent policy, it does not want to launch anything. (This can be seen in the conflicts in Zhanggufeng and the fishing rights in Sakhalin) It can be seen that the Soviet Union is enough to control the overall situation in Europe, and the United States is truly important in the Far East! Under this situation, our country's economic circles have pro-American and Soviet views, especially pro-American. As for the economic circles in Europe, especially Britain, there is a common feeling of befriending the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>In addition, Mr. Liu Xiqing, Mao Chongjie, Daoke, Zhang Yumei, Qian Yishi, Le Hui, Pan Zhihua, Gu Bingqian, Liu Daohong, and so on have similar opinions. Mr. Liu Xiqing also made a basic analysis of the characteristics of the US and Soviet policies, which is particularly admirable; unfortunately, the original text is too long, so I have to cut it short.</p>
<p>The United States Emphasizes Asia and the Soviet Union Emphasizes Europe</p>
<p>Du Yun</p>
<p>The world policy of the United States actually emphasizes the Far East; formally, it seems to emphasize Europe. The Soviet Union emphasizes Europe instead, and formally, it seems to emphasize the Far East. In the difference of emphasis, China's economy should have a closer relationship with the United States; naturally, it is the same relationship with the Soviet Union. Among the United States, the Soviet Union, and China, which are in this subtle connection, Japan will be the most affected. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Financial Commentary</h3>
<p>— Sheng Kaiqiong</p>
<p>—Up to August 3—</p>
<p>Changes in Foreign Exchange Settlement Commodities</p>
<p>The Chinese government's first method of managing export foreign exchange was to stipulate that 24 categories of goods such as tung oil, bristles, leather, wool, and minerals should be settled in foreign exchange. When merchants transport these 24 categories of goods for export, they should first ask the Trade Commission to estimate the foreign currency selling price, and sign a certificate of purchase of foreign exchange from the Central Bank based on this amount. With the certificate, they can go through customs declaration and transportation procedures. After the goods are sold, they must be sold to the Central Bank at the legal exchange rate. If the proceeds from the sale are lower than the Trade Commission's estimate, they can submit sales documents to the commission to apply for a reduction in payment. The implementation period was from May to December 1938. From January 1939, the number of foreign exchange settlement commodities was reduced from 24 to 13. From July 1939, the government took charge of the unified transportation and sales of four categories of goods, including tung oil, tea, bristles, and minerals. All other export goods were settled in foreign exchange, and the settlement amount was not based on the Trade Commission's valuation, but on 90% of the actual selling price certificate issued by the commission. The exchange rate for settlement was also changed to the standard of 7 pence for British gold and 13.625 yuan for US dollars quoted by the Bank of Communications and the Central Bank.</p>
<p>The purpose of managing export foreign exchange is to concentrate foreign exchange to stabilize the financial foundation and cultivate economic strength. Over the past three years, the Chinese government's efforts in this regard have achieved good results. In 1938 and 1939, the foreign exchange pre-sold by merchants to government banks reached 120 million yuan. There have been changes in the foreign exchange settlement method this year. Except for the four categories of goods such as tung oil, which are still transported and sold by the government in a unified manner, 14 categories of goods such as eggs, feathers, casings, leather, fur, gallnuts, medicinal materials, oil wax, ramie, and cotton are designated as foreign exchange settlement commodities among other export goods. Other export goods can be exempted from foreign exchange settlement. The amount of foreign exchange settlement is calculated based on 80% of the actual selling price certificate filled in, but if the goods are transported from the southwest provinces through foreign ports, the cost will increase. To compensate for the merchant's loss, it can be reduced to 70%. At the same time, the handling fee within 3% of the difference between the legal price of foreign exchange and the bank's quoted price paid by merchants to the bank when settling foreign exchange is also exempted. The current method has been implemented since March 15, 1940.</p>
<p>Compared with the past, the current method is similar to the 13 categories implemented in January 1939 in terms of the types of foreign exchange settlement commodities. Because all goods must be settled in foreign exchange, it only increases the management difficulties, and the value of many export goods is very small. In terms of the foreign exchange settlement method, it is the same as the method implemented in July 1939, which is based on the actual selling price certificate issued by the Trade Commission. In terms of the standard of the foreign exchange settlement exchange rate, the method of collecting the difference between the legal exchange rate and the commercial exchange rate is still adopted. However, the foreign exchange settlement amount has been reduced from 90% to 80%, and it can also be reduced to 70% due to particularly high costs. This is because the goods transported from the southwest provinces to Hong Kong for sale via Haiphong, its freight, warehouse rent, sales commission, and taxes account for 15% of the actual selling price. According to the method in July 1939, merchants will lose 5%. Therefore, reducing the percentage makes merchants profitable, so that export trade can be increased to intensify the collection of foreign exchange.</p>
<h3>Revision of Commercial Exchange Rate</h3>
<p>According to news from Chongqing, the Chinese Ministry of Finance has officially announced that the commercial exchange rate of legal tender will be changed to 4.5 pence from August 1. The exchange rates of other foreign currencies are based on the market exchange rate between it and the pound. In early July 1939, the Ministry of Finance announced the "Measures for Applying to Purchase Foreign Exchange for Imported Goods" and the "Measures for Settling Foreign Exchange and Receiving Exchange Rate Difference for Exported Goods", stipulating that applicants for imported foreign exchange must pay a balance fee based on the difference between the legal price and the quoted price of the Bank of Communications and the Central Bank. Exporters of foreign exchange can receive the exchange rate difference between the legal price and the quoted price of the Bank of Communications and the Central Bank. This is the beginning of the use of commercial exchange rates. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>North-South Goods, New Black Watermelon Seeds, First Batch Arrived in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Due to the severe drought and lack of moisture in the soil during this summer, most of the watermelon seedlings withered, and the harvest was greatly reduced. According to production news, it was only 30% to 50% of normal. It is said that the first batch of Xu Kui seeds and Mingguang seeds arrived yesterday, totaling nine pieces, which were sold immediately. It is estimated that the two types of seeds were priced at 87 yuan.</p>
<h3>New Lychee and Honey Dates are Offered at New High Prices</h3>
<p>Hainan lychee, old goods have been out of stock for a long time, the first batch of new goods arrived the day before yesterday, totaling 16 pieces, and has been sold yesterday. The higher price reached 198 yuan, which is a new record. The second price was slightly reduced, and the market outlook is loose.</p>
<p>The first batch of new Suzhou honey dates arrived yesterday, totaling more than a dozen pieces, which were quite rare. It was sold at a bald price of 170 yuan, which is also a high price. The source of the second batch is expected to increase, and it is expected to return to small.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market, Raw White Sugar is Stabilized</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market had little change due to Sunday. The price of raw white sugar from foreign warehouses was reduced from 69 yuan to 68.9 yuan, and then rose to 69 yuan. The price of transshipment goods that are invoiced is 53.2 yuan, Taikoo B Mark is 73 yuan, XH is 69 yuan, and DY is 69.5 yuan.</p>
<h3>Coal Ash, Charcoal is Exceptionally Popular</h3>
<p>Charcoal is usually manufactured in large quantities during the hot summer months for winter use, but this year, due to the rare shortage of raw materials, coal dust, the screened dust in this street is also very expensive, and the gains do not outweigh the losses. Most of the charcoal manufacturers have stopped production, so the market is exceptionally popular. It is estimated that large charcoal is 24 yuan per thousand, and No. 2 is 16 yuan.</p>
<h3>Metals Trading: Slow Trading, Stable and Weak Prices</h3>
<p>Yesterday was Sunday, and the metal market was even more subdued. There were no sales to out-of-town merchants, and transactions within the city were also quite sluggish. Throughout the day, the market only saw slight inquiries for black iron sheets, floral hoop lead wires, small tinplates, and common nails. The rest is hardly worth mentioning. Yesterday, black iron sheets, size 3 feet by 6 feet, mixed with various patterns, were quoted at 70 yuan for three to nine sheets. Selected sheets sold for 75 yuan. Small tinplates sold for 130 yuan per box, with retail prices varying around 1.23 yuan per sheet. Floral hoop lead wires were quoted at 13.50 yuan for 28-pound loads, 26.50 yuan for 56-pound loads, and around 52 yuan for 112-pound loads. Common nails were priced at 46 yuan per barrel (base price). Black iron billets were priced around 1,000 yuan.</p>

<p>How Can Impotent Husbands Enhance Their Energy?</p>
<p>Are there secrets to love? Yes, everything has secrets, and love certainly has them too. So, what are the secrets to love? Let those seeking love not wander down the wrong paths, and enter the joyous garden of love as soon as possible!</p>
<p>We know that a young woman in love is blossoming with the fragrance of her heart, yet shyly hides her feelings, as if concealing a great secret. If this deeply affectionate woman marries a strong and energetic husband, he can instantly draw his charming wife into a joyful and passionate realm in their marital chambers, making her realize the preciousness of happiness in life. Thus, love blossoms, sweetens, and leads to the birth of intelligent children, forming a blissful family. What a joyous life!</p>
<p>However, if a man has committed self-pollution (masturbation) or nocturnal emissions in his youth, or indulged in excessive sexual activity, or suffered from overwork and exhaustion, depleting the endocrine fluids in his reproductive glands, or damaging the nerves that control his sexual functions, then premature ejaculation, impotence, incomplete development, kidney deficiency, infertility, back pain, memory loss, premature aging, and other symptoms will inevitably arise. Even with a charming wife in his arms on a warm night, such an impotent husband is often weak and incapable in their marital life, or only experiences a fleeting moment of pleasure, or cannot even participate at all. This is not only extremely unpleasant for the man himself, but how can a wife in the midst of passionate love not feel resentment? After repeated occurrences, love is completely destroyed, leading to family tragedies such as elopement, divorce, madness, and suicide, which are too numerous to count!</p>
<p>Impotent men must quickly cure their illnesses! To be a good husband, one must enhance one's energy! According to the experience of world-renowned doctors and ourselves, the most effective treatment for curing impotence and enhancing energy is taking "Reproductive Essence," a preparation made from the reproductive glands of healthy animals. This medicine is based on the most effective principle of supplementation therapy in modern medicine, extracting the endocrine essence from the reproductive glands of vigorous animals such as deer, orangutans, and sea dogs, and refining it using scientific replication methods. Therefore, its quality is precious, its efficacy is certain, and its restorative power is unparalleled by any similar preparation. After taking "Reproductive Essence," men will experience increased sperm production, kidney replenishment, enhanced development, brain invigoration, blood circulation, and nerve nourishment within one day and night. Continued use will inevitably cure various symptoms in a short period, doubling their energy. Middle-aged and elderly people who take it regularly will prolong their lives, reverse aging, and rejuvenate themselves. However, those suffering from nocturnal emission must also take "Hymetos' Sperm Consolidation Tablets" (available at major pharmacies such as China-West Five Continents Taihe) to stop the leakage, which will speed up the results!</p>
<p>The secret to love is only to cure hidden ailments and enhance energy. There is no other way. Men and women seeking love, do not wander down the wrong paths!</p>
<p>Beauty</p>
<h3>The Sadness of Atrophied Breasts</h3>
<p>— Dr. Yao Chongpei, American Medical Doctor</p>
<p>Anyone who lives in the city and has a relatively modern mindset knows that the aesthetic ideals for modern women emphasize the beauty of well-developed features and health, rather than the artificiality of sickly beauty. The so-called beauty of well-developed features and health means having high, elastic breasts, a full and well-proportioned buttocks, a lithe and slender waist, and graceful posture when walking. If a woman possesses these qualities, her curves will be fully revealed, her appearance will be pleasing, and even if her face is ordinary, she can move in social circles, winning the praise of many men and gaining unparalleled glory and happiness. On the other hand, if a woman has atrophied breasts, a gaunt buttocks, withered muscles, and no curves, even if she has the face of Xi Shi and the figure of Flying Swallow, heavy makeup and flaunting herself in the market will only be ridiculed by those in the know. What happiness can she have! Not only that, but women with atrophied breasts also have impaired ovarian function, which inevitably leads to irregular menstruation, excessive leucorrhea, malnutrition, frigidity, and infertility. As a result, they have difficulty conceiving, may never conceive, or may conceive but miscarry, or give birth to children who die young. All of these hardships are like arrows piercing the heart, causing immeasurable sorrow. Yet, an unsympathetic husband may repeatedly use the saying, "There are three forms of unfilial conduct, and the greatest is to have no descendants," as an excuse to fulfill his desire to take a concubine. Once the husband's desire is fulfilled, love is broken, and sometimes even a glimpse is impossible. How can one hope for lasting love and affection? Therefore, such women often suffer in silence until the end of their lives, and their fate is extremely tragic! It is a profound sigh! Therefore, in this day and age, the condition of atrophied breasts must not be ignored. One should immediately purchase "Reproductive Essence" for women, an ovarian endocrine preparation, to seek remedy. This preparation has high-quality ingredients, gentle medicinal properties, and accurate efficacy. Taking it for two weeks will greatly increase appetite, clear the mind, lighten the limbs, and reduce fatigue. Taking it for four weeks will most noticeably cause the breasts to feel a sensation of growth, changing from flat to slightly raised, and from loose to firm. If taken for eight weeks, not only will breast development have astonishing results, but also all old and hidden ailments will be completely cured, restoring your inherent health and beauty. That's when you'll be amazed by its remarkable efficacy!</p>
<h3>Untreated Nocturnal Emission Will Bury Youth</h3>
<p>— Zhan Nianceng, Venereal Disease Specialist</p>
<p>The period when spring emotions are aroused in youth is a crucial juncture in their lives. If their will is weak, and they indulge in the bad habit of masturbation, or marry early and engage in excessive sexual activity, damaging their sexual nerves and loosening their sperm gates, they will inevitably develop nocturnal emission. In physiological terms, seminal fluid is the so-called endocrine fluid of the reproductive glands, which nourishes nerves, regulates emotions, promotes development, and accelerates metabolism. Therefore, youths who are chaste, self-loving, and pure in heart will inevitably develop healthily, have clear minds, and have unlimited futures with endless happiness after marriage! Now, suffering from nocturnal emission and neglecting treatment is like having a leak in the source of life without plugging it. If drips are not stopped, they will erode into rivers and seas. The sperm gates will inevitably loosen day by day, and the frequency of emissions will inevitably increase day by day. With the precious and limited endocrine fluid of the reproductive glands constantly leaking out, how can it not be depleted? As a result, symptoms such as memory loss, insomnia, palpitations, back pain, premature ejaculation, impotence, incomplete development, and premature aging will inevitably arise. Such youths, being muddled and incompetent, will not only fail to progress in their studies and have difficulty achieving their goals, with no hope for their future, but also be rejected by women and hated by wives and concubines due to their unattractive appearance and inability to satisfy them sexually. Their youth and happiness will be completely buried as a result!</p>
<p>In fact, nocturnal emission is not an incurable disease. In this era of advanced medicine, there are already the most targeted and effective treatments. This is to take "Hymetos' Sperm Consolidation Tablets," which can effectively consolidate the sperm gates, calm the nerves, and promote sleep on the same night. If the nocturnal emission has already caused the above-mentioned symptoms, one must also take "Reproductive Essence," a preparation made from the reproductive glands of healthy animals, to nourish the brain and kidneys, increase sperm and blood, nourish the nerves, and promote development. Taking it for one month will inevitably cure the above-mentioned symptoms invisibly, strengthening the body and increasing energy. If patients can come to our clinic in person, and receive new treatments such as electrotherapy and injections, we can guarantee a cure.</p>
<h3>(1) Masturbation is the Precursor to Nocturnal Emission</h3>
<p>— Zhan Nianceng, Venereal Disease Specialist</p>
<p>Huang Fuxiang, 18 years old, from Wuxi, lives in Anle Lane, Xiaoshatu Road. He is a student at a certain middle school in this city and is quite intelligent, and his parents love him very much. Unexpectedly, he has recently become increasingly pale and thin, experiencing frequent dreams, insomnia, and a dazed mind during the day, causing his academic performance to plummet. His father suspected something, and carefully observed his sleep and actions, and only then did he realize that his son had become infatuated due to reading erotic novels. He had developed the bad habit of masturbation, which had loosened his sperm gates and caused nocturnal emission. As a result, symptoms such as brain weakness, memory loss, insomnia, palpitations, back pain, pale complexion, and incomplete development arose. It almost ruined Huang's future and buried his youth. His father strictly ordered his son to quit masturbation, and took him to our clinic for treatment. After a specialist physician carefully diagnosed his symptoms, he instructed him to purchase three boxes of "Hymetos' Sperm Consolidation Tablets" and half a dozen bottles of "Reproductive Essence" from the Five Continents Pharmacy, to be taken together, and administered new treatments such as electrotherapy and injections. In just one month, the nocturnal emission was completely cured, and he felt clear-headed, had rich thoughts, a rosy complexion, a strong body, and his academic progress was progressing by leaps and bounds!</p>
<h3>(2) A Husband with Premature Ejaculation and Impotence Is Ashamed of His Wife</h3>
<p>Feng Gang, 30 years old, married for five years. Because Feng suffered from premature ejaculation, impotence, and nocturnal emission, they had never had children, and the love between husband and wife had faded. His wife, unable to bear wasting her youth, secretly engaged in an affair, and was about to discuss eloping with her lover, but fortunately, her plan was discovered by Feng. However, due to his own illness, he could only endure the humiliation after a slight reprimand. Feng realized this and came to our clinic for treatment last month. After a specialist physician examined his condition, he instructed him to purchase a dozen bottles of "Reproductive Essence" and three boxes of "Hymetos' Sperm Consolidation Tablets," to be taken together, and administered new treatments such as electrotherapy and injections. In less than a month, he had become energetic and strong, the love between husband and wife was rekindled, and his wife was completely devoted to her husband.</p>

<h3>"Planting Silver"</h3>
<p>Superstitious people say that deities have the power to turn things into gold; unfortunately, the Greater Celestial Realm does not have the bustling markets of the mortal world, so gold and silver are of no use to the gods, who keep their skill a secret. While the deities do not need such things, there are many people who do. If they were to spread the skill to the world for the sake of helping and benefitting others, why not reveal their divine powers and benefit the world? Yet they refuse to show off their skills, instead watching those with empty wallets and a desire to spend be unable to fulfill their wishes; those with no money left in their bedsides suffer from hunger and cold, unable to sustain their lives. If the deities are truly compassionate, how can they be so cruel? In "Strange Tales from the Leisure Lodge," Pu Songling wrote about money falling from the sky. The story clearly states that a large copper coin was chosen as the seed, and the deity chanted incantations and applied talismans according to the rules, and sure enough, coins rained down from the beams with a clanging sound, piling up ankle-deep in an instant, amounting to hundreds of thousands of strings of cash. The door was closed, but because the demanded reward was too extravagant and the owner was stingy, all the money in the house transformed into flying ants and flew away, leaving only a few seed coins. Although the story is absurd, it shows the foolishness of greedy people and the playfulness of the creator. Recently, a woman named Shu from Nanxiang has been able to stir up women with her outlandish claims, causing them to compete to hand over their silver for her to "plant." It is said that more and more people are coming from afar, and over a hundred families have been deceived. Even after their silver has been swindled away, they are told that it is not yet time to open the soil and that it would be violating the rules and angering the gods, and the foolish women instead beg her to help them resolve the situation. Alas! What trickery does this woman Shu use to make people believe so firmly?</p>

<h3>Clothing, Food, Housing, and Transportation—The Latest Scientific View</h3>
<p>— Zhou Nanhai</p>
<p>Clothing, food, housing, and transportation are of utmost importance to people's livelihoods, physical strength, and the rise and fall, poverty and wealth, of society and the nation. Yet, we often neglect them in our daily habits, unaware of the significant losses. It is truly lamentable! The major powers, with their high levels of public intelligence, are urgently paying attention to research and striving to improve. Scholars advocate, and the government and people work together to implement these changes, not only affecting people's intelligence, longevity, family harmony, and happiness. Since I have been living in Shanghai for five years, recuperating in seclusion, I have read extensively on health-related literature. Now, I will select the latest theories and briefly outline them for my compatriots who are concerned about health and alarmed by aging.</p>
<p>Dr. Roland of Germany is an authoritative figure in longevity medicine. His famous book, "The Causes of Aging and Its Prevention," is included in the World Medical Encyclopedia and has been reprinted seven times and translated into twelve languages (the Chinese translation by Ding Fubao was just published in May). In addition to treating endocrine glands with medication, he also pays particular attention to daily clothing, food, housing, and transportation. Therefore, I will extract the main points and briefly describe them below:</p>
<p>Clothing: Should be loose, thin, and well-ventilated, and he strongly opposes the fashionable hard collars and leather shoes.</p>
<p>Food: Should be vegetarian, with a small amount of meat, and of course, should completely abstain from tobacco, alcohol, and stimulants. However, he cites examples of healthy elderly people from various countries, who occasionally use a very small amount of tobacco and alcohol even beyond the age of one hundred. Housing: Should be in the countryside, mountains, or by the sea, with an outdoor lifestyle, and preferably sleeping outdoors. He strongly opposes elevators.</p>
<p>Transportation: Should be walking, car rides, etc., and he opposes the crowded and dirty trains.</p>
<p>At first glance, these points may seem ordinary, but the methods and underlying theories are profound and extensive, and very different from other people's theories. He also lists the causes, prevention, and effective treatments for various diseases, including the strengths of various modern schools of thought, and is the most appropriate compromise. In my opinion, Western customs often favor extremes, so the resulting philosophies often go to the extreme. Dr. Roland's views are quite consistent with our country's old learning, taking the middle path in everything and being careful to avoid going too far. He is a rare find among Western philosophers. For example, his views on sexual life do not advocate complete abstinence, and his praise of our country's custom of wearing white for funerals, while opposing the Western custom of wearing black (which affects nerves and emotions), proves that our ancestors' guidance of society, their consideration of human feelings, and the development of good customs were indeed based on profound principles, and that the great benefits of strengthening the race and improving health were embodied in daily subtle actions. I am not stubbornly clinging to the past, but I have seen that new scientific discoveries are in fact consistent with the ideas of the ancients. I am unexpectedly pleased by the greatness of our national culture and more confident and self-respecting, and I hope that my compatriots will strengthen themselves.</p>
<p>Organ therapy, which is now popular in Western medicine, has been practiced in our country for thousands of years based on the principles of dietary therapy. Mineral drugs, to prevent aging, the Jin people took Five-Mineral Powder, and alchemists used cinnabar pills, both of which emphasized minerals. However, the refining was not pure and the application was not appropriate, so they serve as a warning. However, their insights are indeed no different from modern scientific methods. Is our country's medicine limited to just grass roots and tree bark? In fact, it encompasses everything, and its effectiveness is due to experience, unlike Westerners who previously only valued minerals. As for the study of preserving youth, which is related to longevity, our country has long been interested in it and has many specialized books on the subject. Dr. Roland also discusses the dos and don'ts of optics, climate, and medicine in his book, but I cannot list them all. I will stop here for now. Those who are interested in further research can consult the original book.</p>
<p>Clothing, food, housing, and transportation are inherently for health, but today's customs often harm life (especially among the wealthy who lack proper knowledge). This is because they do not understand physiology or the principles of things, so they harm themselves day by day without realizing it. The poverty of society, the entanglement of diseases, and the increased mortality rate are truly lamentable. Why wait until old age to seek medical treatment and illness to seek medicine, which rarely helps the dying and weak? Why not pay attention to these things in advance and increase your knowledge in peacetime?</p>
<h3>Clothes and Odors</h3>
<p>— Bai Shui</p>
<p>The clothes we wear, whether they are made of cotton or wool, have the property of absorbing various gases and moisture. Therefore, we must be careful in all places. A friend rented the remaining rooms of a soy sauce workshop. Although he did not come into contact with the soy sauce, people always smelled the odor of soy sauce when he approached. The employees in a perfumery do not apply perfume to their faces or spray perfume on their bodies, but people always smell an intoxicating fragrance when they approach. What is the reason for this? It is because the clothes we wear can absorb odors.</p>
<p>The ability of fabrics to absorb odors varies depending on the material. Generally, wool fabrics retain gases for the longest time, and linen fabrics retain them for the shortest time. Also, wet cloth is easier to absorb gases than dry cloth. If you wear a fur coat or a thick woolen garment and enter an unclean toilet with a foul odor, the odor absorbed by the clothes will take at least one or two days to dissipate. Therefore, even if we pay attention to cleanliness ourselves, we will naturally be contaminated with an odor if we go to an unclean place.</p>
<p>Because clothes absorb odors, we should change our clothes before meeting with our superiors, so as not to bring an offensive odor. It is inevitable that our clothes will be contaminated with unpleasant odors due to carelessness. We ourselves do not notice it because we are used to it, just as "entering a shop selling abalone, one does not smell its odor after a long time." Before meeting with guests, we should carefully change our clothes, regardless of whether we think we have an odor or not.</p>
<p>A person is constantly sweating, and this sweat contains many odors. If we do not change our clothes often, we can also be contaminated with odors from sweat. In winter, we change our shirts or coats, and it seems that the clothes in between will not be unclean. But this is not the case, because fabrics can absorb odors. So, the sweat odor on the shirt can still be absorbed by the middle layer of clothes. Therefore, in winter, the middle layer of clothes should also be changed often.</p>
<h3>A Few Words About Vitamins</h3>
<p>— Ainong</p>
<p>After this publication carried my humble article "Economical Vitamin C" the other day, it surprisingly attracted the attention of readers. The editor forwarded letters from Liu Luqiu and Chen Lanqing, inquiring about what items are the most economical and rich in vitamins A, B, D, and E. Now, I will answer as follows. If there is anything inappropriate, please advise.</p>
<p>Vitamin A is related to human development. Milk, egg yolk, cod liver oil, cheese, and other foods contain it, and cod liver oil is the most abundant source of vitamin A. However, the above-mentioned foods are relatively aristocratic, and ordinary families will not consume them. But spinach and lettuce, such green leafy vegetables, also contain a little. Their prices are much cheaper, but the content is not as high as cod liver oil. However, we must eat fresh ones, because if they are not fresh, the vitamin A content is negligible.</p>
<p>Beriberi is a very painful disease caused by a lack of vitamin B. Especially those who eat Saigon rice, which has been ground by machines, on isolated islands are most likely to contract this disease, because vitamin B is contained in the germ of the rice. After being ground by machines, the rice germ is completely removed, leaving only a grain of starch. Starch does not contain vitamin B, so we should often eat whole grains of brown rice. It is not easy to buy in Shanghai. Some rice stores display the sign "Hygienic Rice," which is artificially ground yellow rice. In the mainland, the price of yellow rice is relatively cheap, but once it comes to Shanghai, with the title of "hygienic," it is more expensive than white rice. In addition to rice, beans and fruits, especially oranges and lemons, contain a little, but the prices of oranges and lemons are prohibitively expensive, so you can only go without. But you can buy some red beans, and often cook some red bean rice, red bean porridge, and red bean soup, all of which should be bland. Vegetables also contain some vitamin B that can dissolve in water, so you must not throw away the soup when cooking vegetables.</p>
<p>Vitamin D content in daily foods is very low. Cereals have absolutely none, and even green leafy vegetables do not have any. But according to recent reports, the liver oil of Rufferfish produced in the Mississippi River in the United States contains a lot. However, we have no way to consume it. Later, many scholars studied and discovered that the ultraviolet rays in sunlight, when irradiated on the human body, cause a certain amount of ergosterol in the skin and subcutaneous fat to be affected by ultraviolet rays, generating vitamin D in the body. So, if we want to get vitamin D, we must allow ultraviolet rays to shine on our bodies. But you should know that ultraviolet rays cannot penetrate glass windows, so those who often live in houses cannot get it. Especially in summer, the ultraviolet rays in sunlight are the strongest, so some people advocate sunbathing. However, on this isolated island, it is good enough to often go to the open park, see the sun's face more often, and be exposed to sunlight more often. We don't need to be afraid of it, because it is our nutrient!</p>
<p>Vitamin E can promote pregnancy function. Milk, white rice, corn, and lettuce all contain a little.</p>
<p>The development of vitamins is truly promising. Vitamin E has already been discovered, and there may be even more gains in the future.</p>
<h3>Continued Notes on the Story of Living</h3>
<p>— Yong</p>
<p>The great Tang Dynasty poet Du Fu, in his middle age, lived in poverty, leading him to reside in a thatched hut. One afternoon and evening during a wind and rainstorm, the thatch covering his roof was blown away; at that time, the bed where Du Fu slept was almost completely soaked by the rain leaking in. However, Du Fu not only did not complain about his situation, but also deepened his sympathy for the general poverty of the world. He hoped that one day they would all have good housing, so that even if he were still confined to this thatched hut, he would be very content. At that time, he chanted a poem, in which there were such lines: "How can I get ten million mansions, to shelter all the poor scholars in the world and make them joyful?" It is my hope that the ruthless landlords on the solitary island today can all hear these words, and no longer seek only personal gain while disregarding others.</p>
<p>Su Shi, one of the eight great masters of the Tang and Song dynasties, once bought a house in Yixing. The procedures had been completed and the price had been paid in full; however, he later returned it to the original owner. The original owner was an old woman who was already past sixty years old, because her son was not successful, so she had no choice but to sell the little property she had inherited. When Su Shi saw this situation, he was naturally moved in his heart. As a result, he did not ask her to return the prepaid money, and the house still belonged to her. In seeking among the people of today, there is truly an insurmountable lament for the past!</p>
<h3>Road</h3>
<p>— Lian</p>
<p>Anyone who has grown up in the countryside, used to walking on muddy roads and treading on gravel roads, cannot help but stick out their tongue and exclaim in surprise when they run to Shanghai and see the smooth and flat asphalt and cement roads. When they see Nanjing Road is piled up of neat teak blocks, they will exclaim it as a spectacle, but in this era of scientific advancement, in a world where nothing is strange, there are also many strange roads.</p>
<p>In England, some people remelt various broken glass and use molds to make square bricks for paving roads, and the road surface is very strong. In the Czech Republic, broken glass and cement are mixed together, called "two-and-a-half soil," to pave roads, and the effect is said to be very great.</p>
<p>In Kimberley, South Africa, there is a road that is inlaid with dazzling pearls, gemstones, and huge diamonds. The value of the entire road is about five million US dollars, and this road can be said to be the most valuable road in the world.</p>
<p>In India, they use a large amount of waste from sugar factories—cheap molasses—to pave roads, becoming an excellent "asphalt road." In the United States, cotton is sandwiched between two layers of asphalt to strengthen the road, just like putting steel bars into cement.</p>
<p>What I have said above is only a small part. I don't know how many other stranger and newer types there are. For example, roads are made of rubber, blunt steel, salt, etc., but we just don't know it.</p>
<p>Ms. Xiuzhen's Compilation - Tianchu Recipe</p>
<p>Eating vegetarian food in summer is particularly in line with the purpose of hygiene. In recent years, more and more Chinese and Western people have advocated eating vegetarian food. The motivation is entirely due to the vitamin content in vegetarian dishes, which is superior to various meat dishes. This recipe is intended to increase the interest of people from all walks of life in vegetarian food. For the matching of seasonal dishes, cleanliness is also the principle. At the same time, in order to break superstitions, it is not marked as pure vegetarian for Buddhist meals, but only focuses on refreshment and coolness. If readers have delicious dishes that meet the needs of summer days and can be included in this recipe, please do not hesitate to record them, so that this recipe will become the most beautiful recipe for the family.</p>
<h3>(43) White Jade Emerald Silk</h3>
<p>— Draft by Bai Huizhen</p>
<p>Preparation… Watermelon peel, lotus root, pickled ginger, monosodium glutamate, soy sauce, fine salt, soybean oil or raw oil</p>
<p>Preparation… Remove the flesh from the watermelon peel and wash it clean, add fine salt, and after a while, wash away the salty juice and cut into thin strips. Also, cut the lotus root and pickled ginger into thin strips. Put them all into a pot and stir-fry, add appropriate amount of monosodium glutamate and soy sauce, then cook again until transparent. The taste is clear and palatable, and the color is beautiful and lovely.</p>
<p>Answer to Mr. Jin's Question about Making Tomato Sauce: First, wash the tomatoes clean, soak them in boiling water, remove the skin and seeds, then cook them over low heat until they are rotten and thick. Add a little sugar crumbs, not too much, then cook again, and stir with chopsticks to prevent scorching. When it appears dry, it is ready. The above is a home-made method. The machinery and organization of those purchased on the market are large and sound, so the taste is very different.</p>
<p>If you want to buy "monosodium glutamate", "Tianchu soy sauce essence", and oil, salt, sauce and vinegar, please call "44914", and a special delivery person will deliver them immediately without charging a delivery fee.</p>
<h3>One Week Economic Menu</h3>
<p>— Ms. Huaying</p>
<p>The editor of this journal forwarded a letter from a reader who signed himself "Hate Fate" the day before yesterday. He claimed to be a small cook in a complex family. His writing was quite fluent and his characters were not bad. He could have been a clerk for someone, but it is a pity that he is a small cook. According to the letter, his mistress is a strange woman who doesn't know the market prices and orders dishes according to my menu every day, insisting that eight jiao is enough; therefore, she often complains that the dishes he buys are too expensive. This small cook has been wronged, so he wants me to explain how much the two meat and two vegetarian dishes I prepare every day cost. Now I want to tell this Mr. Small Cook that your mistress really doesn't know the market situation. Two years ago, eight jiao a day was indeed enough, but now it must be doubled. The word "economic" in my menu is comparative, not absolute. For example, for a middle-class family of eight or nine people, it is relatively economical to eat two meat and two vegetarian dishes for one yuan and five or six jiao a day. My method of distribution is to limit two meat dishes to one yuan, and two vegetarian dishes to about half a yuan. That's how my family does it every day. If your mistress doesn't trust you, she might as well go to the vegetable market with you for a few days, and she will understand everything and won't let you be wronged.</p>

<h3>About "The Happiness of Apprentices"</h3>
<p>— Ding Ren</p>
<p>After reading "The Happiness of Apprentices" in this journal on July 30, I have some thoughts, so I would like to talk about it:</p>
<p>Giving apprentices who are living in pain some spiritual encouragement and comfort cannot be considered a bad thing, but to obliterate the existence of objective facts and measure everything with a moderate imagination is inevitably to fall into the viewpoint of "idealism" and to misunderstand the "worldview" that an author should have, that is, the author's standpoint. Therefore, in this work of the happy person, we not only do not see the direction to guide apprentices to obtain true happiness, but also smell a paper full of class atmosphere; we not only do not see the pointer to thoroughly transform the lives of apprentices, but also the decadent style of reformism; in other words, this is not to fight against the minority who rule this society; but to surrender to the minority to seek personal opportunities. In the future, it will be even better to change from "apprentice, boss..." and become a minority himself, and slowly create the "apprentice" wholesale store that he tried before. At the same time, this "happy person" completely underestimated the entire national, collective strength, and completed the "personal struggle history" by separating personal livelihood from national livelihood. This is a very wrong understanding, but this is also to say that the "happy person" only sees the phenomenon, but does not grasp the essence.</p>
<p>Secondly, the examples cited in the "Happiness" article are all British and American celebrities, and they have ignored that they are standing in China and are seeking a way out for Chinese apprentices; they have ignored the differences between China's social system, social nature and those of Britain and the United States. It is to confuse the capitalist society of Britain and the United States with the semi-feudal and semi-colonial society of China; it is not to see clearly the real living conditions of Chinese apprentices, but to say subjective "cool words". In fact, to be honest, to change the current "washing rice, washing vegetables, starting a stove, holding a child, washing diapers... apprentice life" is by no means a trivial and partial issue. Even if we take a step back, just as this "happy person" imagined, at most a few "bosses" and "managers" will be created. After all, there is only one Edison in the world, let alone the difference in social nature between the United States and China?</p>
<p>Therefore, my opinion is that in order to reasonably solve the painful current lives of apprentices, it should be linked to the liberation of the entire nation. This is also like women who want to be liberated must work hard in their position, and the goal of their efforts in their position is undoubtedly the same goal pursued by the entire nation. Therefore, the solution to the lives of apprentices should also be a link in this whole. If you insist on separating it, the result will be drilling into a "dead end".</p>
<p>Finally, I would like to make a sincere appeal on behalf of the apprentices: First, please bosses and masters broaden your horizons and see what time it is in China now. Delaying the precious time of young people is not only sorry for the apprentices themselves, but also sorry for the country and the nation. Second, I object to the "happy person's" personal struggle method, but should use collective methods to learn and struggle: apprentices should find apprentice friends around them, or more progressive masters or close upper-level elements to unite together, so that they can truly pool their wisdom and learn the knowledge they want to learn. At the same time, only in this way can they get rid of the current pain and get true happiness. Otherwise, if you run with this "happy person", you will never run to the bright road in your life. Recently, I saw a movie—Aviation Hero, which had such a sentence: "Why would such a great person be born in an ordinary family?" That has to be attributed to the thorough transformation of society. Third, I hope that people who are enthusiastic about social welfare can come out and run a few apprentice schools like "newsboy schools", which would be of immeasurable merit. Although the environment in Shanghai is bad, this kind of social welfare has not yet been completely "blocked", so this is not a question of being locked by others, but a question of willingness! The above opinions are humble, but in order to seek the true happiness of apprentices, I cannot but state my humble opinions and wait for the correction of those who know.</p>
<p>Amateur Chat</p>
<h3>After Reading "The Happiness of Apprentices"</h3>
<p>— Shi Wei</p>
<p>After reading Cao Lingyou's "The Happiness of Apprentices" in this journal on the thirty-first of last month, I feel that I have a lot to say; first of all, I very much agree with Cao Jun's subjective wish to write that article, that is, "It is nothing more than to prove that people who are apprentices should not be too pessimistic, but should seize the opportunity of patience and work hard, and there will always be a day of success." This spirit of not being discouraged in a bad environment and striving for progress should be promoted.</p>
<p>However, from an objective point of view, Cao Jun's article will lead people to terrible conclusions; my impression after reading the article twice is this: that is, people are happy to be apprentices, although apprentices are doing "humble work," taking "stipends that are not enough to buy daily necessities," and suffering from "the temper of the old manager"... but these are happiness for apprentices. Therefore, the apprenticeship system is also reasonable.</p>
<p>Cao Jun uses the achievements of Edison and others to prove that being an apprentice is not without prospects, and his intention is quite kind; but I want to ask, how many of the like of Edison, Wells, and Franklin are there among thousands of apprentices?</p>
<p>I can't think of a popular example for a while, so let's turn the book. I have a foreign language booklet on hand, which has this section:</p>
<p>"The flowers and plants in the courtyard are gray, thin and weak. Why are they gray and weak? Because they grow under the big pine tree, the big pine tree proudly stretches its branches and completely covers the sunlight.</p>
<p>"And the monks and servants in the monastery often trample on them and damage their buds, so the flowers and plants in the courtyard are gray and weak.</p>
<p>"Now let's look at the flowers and plants by the river. They fully enjoy the sunlight and freely absorb water, so they can thrive. They are strong, they live happily, and they comfortably and proudly stretch their green leaves."</p>
<p>Obviously, the like of Edison are only a few branches in the flowers and plants in the courtyard that occasionally get sunlight and have not been trampled by monks. But the vast majority are born gray and weak. So, do we hope that there will be a few countable Edisons in society, or countless Edisons, like the flowers and plants by the river?</p>
<p>Cao Jun also talked about the problem of suffering, but I think it lacks principles: I have pointed out about the way in my article "Talking about Apprentices" in this journal on the twenty-fourth of last month, so I should bring it to a stop here.</p>
<p>The text is finished, but I still have some thoughts; I am happy that the apprenticeship issue has attracted attention. Therefore, I personally hope that the readers of this journal who have been apprentices and are still apprentices will write down their various experiences; wouldn't this make our theory closer to reality?</p>
<h3>Repeating a Grade·Transferring Schools·Promoting</h3>

<p>Student: "Teacher, will I repeat a grade?" Teacher: "If you repeat a grade, what are you going to do?"</p>

<p>Hawthorne Case</p>
<h3>The Ballerina's Destination</h3>
<p>— Written by Cheng Xiaoqing</p>
<p>Chapter 4 Several Hypotheses</p>
<p>I saw that the bellboy's uniform really had the number 71 embroidered on it in red thread. This was a young man in his twenties, with a pair of dark eyes that fully showed that he was not only quick-witted, but also well-trained." However, the main subject of training for waiters in large hotels is not how to serve passengers, but how to distinguish the size of passengers' wallets and how to make money. This number 71 glanced at the corner of his eye into his palm, and then looked up to estimate Hawthorne and me, then nodded, and immediately performed his training skills.</p>
<p>"Sir, what's the matter?" The title of "Sir" was clearly a reaction produced by something in his hand.</p>
<p>Hawthorne said, "What kind of people live in this number 74?"</p>
<p>The bellboy hesitated for a moment and replied, "A man and a woman, surnamed Jin."</p>
<p>"Is the man a young man in a suit?" "No, he's an old man in Chinese clothes. The woman is still only in her twenties." When I heard this, I couldn't help but feel disappointed again. This was certainly not the person we were looking for. But Hawthorne still did not show a negative expression.</p>
<p>He continued to ask, "When did they come?"</p>
<p>Number 71 replied, "Just arrived—less than an hour ago." Hawthorne's eyes flashed. "Then, who lived here yesterday?" The quick-witted bellboy seemed to suddenly remember something and hurriedly replied, "Yes, it was a young man, wearing a suit, very tall, surnamed Qian."</p>
<p>Hawthorne quickly took out the small photo from his chest pocket. "Is this the person?"</p>
<p>The waiter looked at the photo and nodded repeatedly, saying, "That's the person. He moved out yesterday—no, actually he moved out today."</p>
<p>My hope suddenly recovered, and I was of course very happy.</p>
<p>Hawthorne asked again, "When exactly did he move out?" (66) Completely blocked the sunlight.</p>
