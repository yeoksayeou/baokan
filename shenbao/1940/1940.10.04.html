<p>倫敦　路透社外交訪員稱、今後半月內復開緬甸公路之問題、提出決定時、英日關係將入於緊張階段、英國之封閉此路、本爲對日綏靖之姿勢、今日本旣公然允許於某種情勢下援助軸心國、則英國似未可維持此種姿勢矣、（三日路透社電）</p>

<p>昨日聞悉：（一）蘇聯某發言人告美國記者，謂外傳蘇聯將犧牲中國，以與日本諒解之說。絕非真寶。（二）德國外長里賓特洛甫有赴莫斯科之說，為三國盟約以及促進蘇日親和而活動。（三）日本方面竭力鼓吹蘇日接近，其新任駐蘇大使負有進行一切談判的職責。㈣美國方面或以為美蘇接近，今僅在外交上有其良好機緣，但無實現之政治的理由；美蘇若在目前開始談判，美國所處地位並不優良。這幾種有關蘇聯的消息，假定可以證明其為惑確或不確，皆將予世局前途以影響，而影響遠東者尤深刻。本報昨日評述遠東新局勢中得蘇聯與日本，當謂蘇聯現在不會立即與英美聯合對日，但亦決不會與德義日三國沆瀣一氣；他與日本之間的國交現狀，使南進欲亢奮已達頂點的日本，黏著了一個重大的弱點；同時，這也就是遠東侵略與反侵略者掙逐的焦點；蓋在遠東新局勢中，沿太平洋的各國今後無法絕對超然事外，而蘇聯是其中最具有決定作用的因素。以此評述，證以前述消息，更足映示蘇聯在今後的國際舞臺，是何等角色。　為世界大局計，吾們當然希望蘇聯奮袂登臺，做一個正角；但在蘇聯，除了若干因利乘便的舉動而外，至少在最近的將來，是採取沉機觀變的態度，這是我們一貫的觀察。他所謂和平中立，是主關的，是富有時間性的；而西歐與東亞的兩面動盪，使他的和平中立祗成為暫時的體態，卻不得不在沉機觀變之中埋頭於最積極的準備。最近蘇聯海軍在海參威外的大規模演習以及陸軍空軍所作新戰術的演習，決非徒供報章與影片作宣傳資料；而三國盟約宣佈之後，他又非正式的表示繼續維持其和平中立，亦祗能看作新態度的尙未發動。現在歐戰時有演成新局面的可能，太平洋隨時有發生大波濤的可能，蘇聯必不會依然如故而無所策動。那時候究將成如何局勢，自非目前所得斷言；可是其問有可分別觀者，蘇聯所須應付的，籠統說來，似乎是同時應付西歐東亞兩變局，其實兩面不同，未可等量齊觀，在歐洲，無論蘇聯對於目前交戰中得雙方，有如何親　　疎之辯，怎樣抑揚其間，祗因蘇聯對於這一戰爭的基本認識，視為對等的爭霸，故所謂親疎抑揚，無非是因時制的策略；到了時過境遷，蘇聯又得因事制宜。不但蘇聯的認識如此，歐戰分了勝敗之後，所影響及於蘇聯者，不免是利害錯雜；亦即不論誰勝誰敗，皆無法使蘇聯感覺得自此安全而穩定。至於東亞戰局，無論在性質上，事實上，以及蘇聯的認識上，非所謂對等的爭霸，而是黷武與和平的較量：將來一勝一敗，一消一長，使蘇聯直接感覺到從此可以相安，或從此多事且危險：：因為勝利後的中國，謂將予蘇聯以何種脅迫，必為中蘇雙方所共認為絕對不能想像的事情。從歐亞兩局之性質與前途的迥不相同，可以推想目前蘇聯所沉機觀變的，所積極準備以應付的，亦對東對西，兩相殊絕。　國際演變，雖因三國盟約而由晦澀趨向清朗，但在清朗之中，仍將視各方舉措的程度與時機而造成懸殊的後果。誰敢斷言尙未實行的一切，必成事實。例如英國在遠東，我們深信其已有妥協無益的覺悟，已有放棄妥協的衝動；但其最近將來的舉措如何，還要視其心理的自信程度而轉移，還要視其估量海峽戰事的前途而轉移，例如美國對遠東，我們深信其政策必遠大堅定，貫澈始終；但於其實行之際，誰能保證其必能逐步悉中機宜。因此種種，殆將予沉機觀變中得蘇聯以若干影響。觀察英美，似乎在遠東問題範圍之內，頗有所期待於蘇聯；這類期待，我們感覺到不免有因果賓主倒置的錯誤；因為蘇聯似是[世界之謎]，其實蘇聯對遠東的態度，其為鮮明，英美對此，正不必有何新的期待；相反的，蘇聯在遠東是否肯更進一步而有更好的作為，大約在英美毅然有所作為之後。換一方面說，蘇聯對歐局可能的作為，有其廣大的角度，也許此[世界之謎]再揭曉時，可以使世界再震驚。但在遠東，不論日本對蘇聯如何企圖，如何許願，不論德國如何代日本從旁活動，亦很可能的蘇日之間竟然成立了何種協定；但可深信其內容，至多有關太平洋未來的風雲，或僅限於解決蘇日兩國之間的簡單問題；若謂蘇聯參加三國盟約，若謂蘇聯接受日本速了所謂中國事變的意願，則為事實所必無。蘇聯對遠東，在力量上自是具有決定作用的因素，但力量必以發動而見實效，蘇聯在目前是以援助中國為止，而暫時不會遽有何種發動的。發動一切，先視英美。</p>

<p>本文是Christian　Science　Monitor報駐倫敦訪員的報告，茲譯錄如次。</p>
<p>德國對英，決不能像對波蘭，荷蘭，比利時及法國閃電戰中一樣，在空軍上佔壓迫倒的優勢。英國空戰的成功已有顯著的事實可證。舉例來說，八月十八日，德國空軍大舉轟炸倫敦的結果，德機六百架中，被英國空軍擊落者，達一百四十一架，而英機的損失，只有二十二架。比　極可注意。倫敦居民，正像英國沿海居民一樣。業已表示他們能夠應付這一問題。不但此也，德國打擊英國及其不列顛帝國心臟的企圖，不獨消耗極大，並且在戰略上，也毫無效果可言。</p>
<p>英國空軍在空戰中的成功，並不視擊落敵機數目的多寡而定，雖則此項數目的多寡，也極關重要。德國空軍自八月八日大舉轟炸英國以來，遭　嚴重損失，已有肯定的事實為之證明。自八月八日實行白天大舉轟炸英國之日起，至九月十六日止，德國飛機業已喪失一千七百九十九架，此項數目已經各方證實。此外尚有德國飛機八百架被毀，但尙未經英國官方證實。德國在此期內陣亡的或被俘的飛行員約有六千人，而英國飛機的損失僅六百　十八架，並有飛行員二百九十二人幸免於難。此項數目包括在德被毀飛機及偵察北海及其他地帶失事飛機在內。就全部言，在八月六日以前，英國已擊落德國飛機三千零二十一架，其中很多為戰鬥機。又據英方估計，至彼時為止，德國飛行員，業已喪失約九千人。</p>
<p>舍數目不論，其他更可注意者，英德空戰且已證明優勢不屬於德國，而實屬於英國。在德機大舉襲擊英國八日之中，德國飛機皆在幾百架以上，其中至少有兩次超過一千架，德軍的損害。此項意見，並不完全根據英方公報，有經驗的中立觀察家，亦作如是觀。</p>
<p>德國對英空襲的目標約有三項：第一，軍行空中對鎖政策，以與海上的潛艇與魚雷艇封鎖相呼應。第二，想由空襲以達到進攻英國海岸之目的，特別在使英國空軍由空戰中及毀壞飛機場與飛機工廠而至消滅。第三，以不加揀別的進襲非軍事地帶，擾亂交通及其他損害國民抵抗的方法，以打擊英國的民氣。</p>
<p>就第一項目標而言，德國空中對封鎖業已失敗，德國現已放棄此項目標，即其顯著的證據，德國對英的空襲，最初本集中於商埠，海港，護送艦及船塢，現已大部分改向內地轟炸。據親到英國各重要商埠視察的公正中立觀察家意見，及由管理航運及食糧當局的證明，吾人可斷言，德軍空中封鎖並無成功的希望。且德國轟炸機最近白天空襲，比之以前的夜襲，更無成就可言。英國空軍戰士，藉高射炮之助，及防空汽球與空軍隊伍的合作，已足使德國空軍的進襲，僅為一嚴重的騷擾而已。</p>
<p>德國第二項目標在於造成壓倒英國空軍的優勢。國社黨宣傳部所發表的數目，如屬可信，德國空軍當然已可完成這項目標。然空戰的結果，尙難於斷定。但英國的「噴火」式機及「旋風」式機比之德國飛往英國作戰的任何種飛機，都已顯出無可否認的優勢。</p>
<p>再就轟炸英國飛行場一項而言，英國當局並不否認若干飛機場已遭德機嚴重的襲擊，損害究至如何程度，此事有關軍事秘密，不能宣佈。但可得而言者，德機的轟炸，至少尙無使英空軍不能繼續應用的飛機場。德空軍轟炸英國飛機工廠的情形，亦復相同。少數飛機工廠雖已被德國空軍投彈擊中，但其損害的程度，遠較德國使用大批飛機以求達到的目標為低。據可靠的估計，各兵工廠因德機的襲擊而工作時間延誤者，較英機所加　於德國的，只及十分之一。</p>
<p>就德機空襲第三項目標而言，德國空軍打擊英國民氣，其失敗更為顯然。其最近最好的例證，可由德機襲擊倫敦情形來說明。據德國無綫電廣播：德國空軍擬將英國首都附近大部份炸為平地，使倫敦民氣為之消沉。然而事實與此相距太遠。倫敦近郊小部份地帶若遭受很大的損害，居民死傷亦多。近郊有一車站，且被擊中，並有　三　　路交通。　　　　　　，不是　　　　。理工作即在進行，路綫即收拾清楚，交通又如平時一樣恢復起來了。</p>
<p>記者當空襲時，適在該交通綫火車中，其目睹情形如下：</p>
<p>「警報大鳴之後，大部分乘客多走到車廂以外，只有我們四個人仍在車上。在兩站之間，突然發生不斷的撞擊之聲。火車停下來了，我們仍在車中等待著，聽見飛機在空中飛過，也聽見幾個炸彈爆發聲，與機關槍開火聲，並有飛機一架飛至鐵路綫上空開放機關槍。那飛機越過該路後，響聲隨後即減低下去。</p>
<p>坐在車角上的人說：「我想空襲對於我們的影響，不過如此罷了。」</p>
<p>「過了不久，我們坐在黑暗中，覺的厭倦，便開了窗，拉上窗簾。什麽都看不見，在前面只有些半　點，在這期間，大家相聚作諧談，不久火車又在開始動了。</p>
<p>「約過半英里的路程，我們就到了被轟炸的車站，玻璃狼藉，月古旁邊，見有一節火車　　　　，彈孔很多，木　　　，　　　　　，下面的大街上，一排店面也被炸去。</p>
<p>「另一方面，一直下去約離開四分之一英里，有著好幾家房屋被炸彈擊中；救火會和警察正在工作，在我們一個半小時的停留期間，火已經撲滅，街道也清除了，使人發生一種深刻印象。</p>
<p>「該鎮的附近看來極為鎮靜。大部分乘客走出了火車，去視察損失，但他們聽到站　在大聲呼喊道：這次並無一人受傷。</p>
<p>「後來又有一個房屋被毀的男子說：「炸轟只毀壞了我們的住宅，並沒有擊毀一家工廠。」</p>
<p>更有一顯著的反證，足以證明德國所宣佈倫敦生活已遭打擊的不確，就是英國板球　仍在球　及鄉村草地照常進行，此項球戲，即使一時中斷，但警報一解除，立即又恢復起來了。</p>
<p>從記者在英國東南部幾次空襲的經驗中，並在空襲後　英國人民談話，顯然可以看出，英國的民氣並沒有消沉。</p>
<p>德國飛機雖以不加揀別　方法，轟炸　　並非　　目標的地帶，　　　　　　　，但依然無補於實驗。（完）</p>

<p>（香港通訊）名國畫家張善孖以「虎痴」馳譽藝壇、二十七年冬奉派隨于斌主敎出國宣傳、並携往其所作「正氣歌圖」「忠孝節義」巨畫多幀、在各地展覽籌振、頗得友邦人士之贊譽及各地僑胞之歡迎、成績殊稱圓滿、氏於八月杪離美返國、九月二十五日清晨抵埠、吳部長代表鄭炳忠及其至友雷竺笙簡琴齊陸丹林等、到埠歡迎、氏下榻銅鑼灣灣景樓琴齊書舍、預定休息數日、卽行赴渝復命、擾張氏對記者談此行經過、茲誌於後、</p>
<p>首赴法京　張氏於二十七年十二月間自昆明經越南出國、初張氏於八一三、抗戰開始、為鼓舞民氣、乃選文天祥作正氣歌、作畫十四幅、頗得當局之讚許、林主席蔣委員長均親為題字、歷在漢口重慶等地展覽、觀者稱譽不止、旋又作「忠孝節義」畫四幅、林主席為題寓意精深」四字、是年十一月參政會議決定派于斌主敎出國謝振、同時派氏以中央振委會委員名義、隨往宣傳、先行赴歐、首抵法京巴黎、法政府崇仰其藝術、特允借國家博物館為其展覽會塲、法總統勒伯倫並親往參觀、私人展覽會在該館舉行、尙屬初次、可見法當局對其藝術之重視、旋以亟須趕赴美參加世界博覽會、故未及赴英比瑞各國、</p>
<p>在美經過</p>
<p>由歐赴美、始悉政府不參加世博會、故先後在紐約·芝加哥·費城·三藩市·波斯頓等地、單獨舉行展覽、均得當地熱心僑胞友邦人士之贊助、所獲成績至佳、同時售畫籌振、收入款項、均由當地人士直接匯寄重慶、而各學校團體請渠演講所酬謝之車費、亦掃數匯義政府、作為振款、美總統羅斯夫人、聞其盛名、曾數度邀氏入宮、待為上賓、美福亨大學為天主敎所創辦、對氏熱心救濟事業之精神、深為敬仰、而對氏藝術之造就、尤為推崇、特贈法學博士學位、於本年六月十二日舉行盛大授位典禮、氏對此殊榮、認係此行意外之收穫、</p>
<p>出品一斑</p>
<p>氏此次携往展覽之作品、除上述之「正氣歌圖」等畫外、尙有「怒吼吧中國」「羣虎」等巨畫、大者長逾二丈許、允稱巨作、此外如山水人翎毛等、無不具備、可謂集團畫之大成、諸作均攝成照相、競賣振購者踴躍、氏在返國之輪上、更將作品展覽、招待同輪乘客船員等參觀、頗得好評、氏在國外仍御長衫布履充分代表我團樸實沉毅之民族精神、予歐美人士以深刻之印象、</p>
<p>在港展覽</p>
<p>張氏於九月二十五日由美抵港返國、所有作品亦均隨身携带、初因行期忽促、不願在港展覽、近由張氏友好許世英·吳鐵城·葉恭綽·杜鏞·王曉籟·許地山·胡政之·簡又文·楊天驥·簡經綸等發起、要求張氏作一短期展覽、俾供港方人士之欣賞、張氏雖以情不可却、終因留港時間過促、祗允作非公開性質、將其作品陳列半日、邀請香港中外名流及文化界參觀、作品概不出信、亦不售門票、請柬將由許氏等代為分發、並約陸丹林·馬國亮·葉淺予·張正宇·雷竺笙·簡而明·楊紀等負責佈置一切、展覽期內、愛好張氏藝術者、誠可一飽眼福也、</p>

<p>百樂力戰後來居上</p>
<p>八時一刻、於裁判瞿鴻律銀笛聲中、展開血戰、盤旋三分鐘之久、鴨蛋兩雙、雙方勾心鬥角、未幾樊慶咸罰李震中、恰中紅心、國友先開紀錄、百樂門反攻、李震中二比一百樂門後來居上、國友諸雄、雖一旦召集、依然銳利非凡、合作如常、李祖德一射、邱孝慈擦的一聲、再加張少卿犯規、樊慶咸加上一罰、國光方面、驟增五分、比數形成六比二、國友佔得優勢、第百樂門鎭靜逾恒、從容應付、終於馮念華翻身一射、打開頹勢、八比四後、百樂門漸見得手、李震中穿楊妙射、長鹿代王鏡湖登塲、下馬施威、打成八比八平等局面、此後則念華兩射、少卿祥龍之一罰一擲、一氣增上十一分之多、國友則僅陳邦珍之一射、十比十五、結束前半時百樂門後來居上、</p>

<p>— 施翔</p>
<p>本年的遭遇</p>
<p>小型絲廠，自去年經營獲利以來，本年度大部擴充範圍與改進生產，經統計，無錫一地之小型工塲，計有三百七十餘家之多，總車數共為九千七百部，生產量亦足驚人，惜本年因繭本巨大，故各廠所收原料不足二月之工作，目下停工者，占百分之八十，僅少數維持工作矣。</p>
<p>本年在春繭未登塲前，各廠興緻濃厚，誰料春期營業，適得其反，事實為始料所不及，大都虧折數萬，尙屬徼倖，而少數廠家，竟有虧蝕殆盡者，茲述其原因，不外三點。</p>
<p>繭本鉅大</p>
<p>本年度春期在開秤前，會由同業　議，評定繭價，當時依照上海洋行絲價，折算每担鮮繭價格為二百五十元，最高不得超出三百元，當經一致通過，如以上項價格收貨，　其虧蝕，必無目下之大也，然經營小型絲廠者，大都雜湊成班，對於絲繭，旣無相當經騐，而於成本，更無確切之計算，僅憑往年之冒險賒欠，而獲利奇鉅，故春繭開秤，即見三百元之限價，嗣後一日數市，直趨高峯，結果竟至四百五十元以上，查繭價所以會造成如此高價者，其間尙有一大原因在，按當地土痞，地棍，橫行不法，憑其手段，在繭行附近，魚肉鄕民，以賤價强行收買，鄕民有不願者，輙遭痛毆，且脅以武器，最後復以嚴厲手段，自定價格，硬售與繭行，各行主等迫於淫威，亦無法對付，祗得忍痛收買，然因唱價過高，且鄕民直接赴行售賣者已寥若晨星，故不得不實行停秤，如此情形，各處均有，是亦造成繭本鉅大之重要原因也。（未完）</p>

<h3 id="c99">「失敗與成功的途徑」 <a href="#c99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>— 民强</p>
<p>基督敎靑年會為促使民衆努力進取，十月一日在各報發表「失敗與成功的途徑」俾各檢討行為，勿再墮於醉生夢死的境地。共用意良深。內容包括衣食住行禮義廉恥各方面，總共六十六項。「成功途徑」中之第五項：將自己所任之工作認為發展自己所長之機會。第七項：不虛費光陰作無謂之事。第八項：在應當休息時休息，使精神尙有餘裕。第十七項：從自己底日常工作，以熱誠的態度，强有力的方法及有効力的方法去做。及第廿三項：從觀察中、閱讀巾、及規定自修中，繼續不斷的去求得舉識。在這五項中，完全可以說是針對着現在的職業靑年及在學靑年而言。現在的一般靑年，對、於現實及工作多是非常不滿意的。因為不滿意，就無形中分成絕對相反的兩種人：一種是具有堅韌向上奮鬥的精神的；另一種就是頹廢的向下的，這一種又可以說是「現實的俘虜或工作的俘虜」者。對於這種錯誤的生活方法或方式，在「失敗的途徑」中，已明白地指示了出來，只要我們明白這些失敗的原因，而依着「成功的途徑」做法，是沒有不可以改善的。</p>
<p>在「失敗的途徑」中，牠又很明白而扼要地指出數點很重要的失敗原因：（一）睡眠到被催迫才肯起身。（二）但求樂趣，不顧義務。（三）逃避工作，除非為勢所迫不得不做。（四）愛奢侈，服裝華而不實。（五）從不發生創作的理想。……以上所說的五點，都是靑年最易犯着的毛病。</p>
<p>靑年們！這的確是失敗與成功的途徑。我們只要努力向着「成功的途徑」各項做去，對於事業上及工作上是沒有不成功的。及時努力吧！允其是上海的靑年們，再莫去犯「失敗的途徑」中所述之各項了。</p>
<h3 id="c100">以最高度的警惕　執行我們的工作　一個助產士的懇切呼籲 <a href="#c100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>— 陸洋</p>
<p>讀了九月二十五日本刋所載李傑先生「懇哺哀子」，同情之心，油然而生。李夫人之死，非特使李先生家庭妻離子散，亦卽是給正在做母親或未做母親的婦女們一個嚴重的威脅。一個無辜的婦女，在他正憧憬着做母親的歡樂的時候，却不料竟以分娩的困難而卒以身殉，誠世間之慘事也。</p>
<p>在目前，除了少數養尊處優的太太小姐們之外，其他的婦女是很少時間和充裕的經濟，讓自己滿足健康的要求，加之社會對他們的忽視，於是成千成萬的婦女從自己莫明其妙的　合上遭受了不白的犧牲；這樣的情形，允其在婦女分娩的時候，是不可避免地暴露出來了。李夫人也許就是其中的一個，雖然我不能探知李夫人之死的直接原因。</p>
<p>我曾經在浙省一個產科醫院裏看到許多將垂亡的產婦從醫師悉心救治下得到了更生，很少因了不能救治的原因而遭到了死亡的，但是那裏與這裏的情形是不同的；這個不同，或者就是李夫人之所以死亡的原因吧！希望關心這個問題的丈夫們，婦女們來作一個共同的討論：</p>
<p>（一）李夫人受孕後至分娩前沒有上醫院去檢查，這增加了死亡的可能性，因為有許多形成難產的原因，在檢查發覺後可以人力挽回預防其困難的：如心臟病·肺病·血壓過高·胎兒方位異常·前置胎盤。胎兒過大。骨盤過小等等。上海雖不乏組織完備辦事認眞的產科醫院，但以不完全的產科技術為吃飯的手段而置他人生命幸福如兒戲的又何嘗不多呢！好的醫院當然會提醒產婦以予產婦免費的愼重的檢查，但只想賺錢的就不顧你這許多了。許多婦女都是缺乏生理醫藥常識的，所以醫務工作者不應該僅是一個手藝主義者，而應該更積極地推廣婦女的產科智識。</p>
<p>（二）有的醫院，取費是比較低廉，技術也高明些，但是他們是吾為了每一個病人－產婦誠懇地盡他們最大的努力，那是很大的疑問了。少數的醫師，助產士的冷漠態度眞使我們吃驚。如產婦的產前後出血。子宮破裂內出血等，往往因醫師救治不速而遭慘死！</p>
<p>（三）對於醫療工作者的困難和麻煩，我們當然非常同情和感激。如果有因此而就對本位工作的失責，那却是絕對不可以寬容的。「醫療首重道德」，如果因求治者的社會及經濟地位低下，而就澳然處之，消毒不注意，手術不愼重，置人情。法律於不顧（照理，有生命之虞之難產，於分娩前應有院方通知家屬簽字，然後院方才能施以手術）。為了許多將做母親者的幸福着想，我們應該將此種事實向社會暴露出來，促起社會人士的注意，並對那些不負責任者以輿論法律的制裁。</p>
<p>末後，我謹以一個助產士的身份，向全社會的醫務工作者呼籲：以我們最高度的驚惕和誠意來執行我們的工作吧！我們旣是為了救人類的疾病和死亡而來的，就不要讓一個無辜的人枉死在我們的疏忽裏啊！為了自己的良心，也為了別人的幸福！（酬作寒衣捐）</p>

<p>北河南路天潼路口，有一中年奇丐作別開生面之吿地狀。渠於人行道上，畫成一盛滿米飯之飯碗，下寫：「嗚呼！飯雖滿，奈我不能取之充飢何？」想見其有無限感慨。後並附一聯：「同是肚皮，飽者不知飢者苦；一樣面孔，得時休笑失時人。」亦意味深長。一時觀者如堵，但慷慨解囊者仍屬寥寥。</p>

<p>— 程小靑著</p>
<p>第八章　捉住了兩個人</p>
<p>我禁不住自動地給伊一個提示。我說道：「那個陸健笙怎麽樣？他會不會打死麗蘭？」</p>
<p>安娜抬起頭來瞧着我，答道：「陸健笙？陸經理嗎？我不知道。」伊頓了一頓，又說：「麗蘭跟小余的關係，向來是瞞着陸經理的。伊自以為很秘密，莫非現在已給他看破！」</p>
<p>霍桑忽向我搖一搖頭，自顧自提出新的問題。一姜小姐，你可知道麗蘭有僩表兄，叫李守琦？」</p>
<p>安娜呆了一呆，點頭道：「知道的。他不單是麗蘭的表兄，而且還是伊的未婚夫。」</p>
<p>霍桑本來把背心靠着椅背，坐得很舒適的，這時他突然挺直了身子，眼光也閃動了一下。這是個新的情報，我也不能不有些驚奇。不過如果再牽引開去，我不能不承認霍桑的案情複雜，當眞也「言之有因」了。霍桑仍用鎭靜的聲浪，說道：「喔，他是麗蘭的未婚夫？你能不能說得詳細些？」</p>
<p>姜安娜道：「據　蘭告訴我，這李守琦是伊的姑夫的兒子，他們從小就在一起的。霍先生，你總知道麗蘭是伊的姑父李芝範撫養長大的，因此伊從小就許配給許琦。自從麗蘭到上海以後，伊的眼光自然轉變了。那李守琦是當小學敎員的，每月祗掙二三十塊錢，在麗蘭眼裹，自然再看不上。」</p>
<p>霍桑見安　停頓着不說，便接續伊的語氣，說道：「因此麗蘭就主張退婚。對不對？」安娜點頭道：「對，不過這件事至今沒有辦妥。前年秋天，伊的姑夫和他的兒子到上海來，就要麗蘭回去成親。麗蘭當然不肯，伊還提出退婚的意思，情願承認些損失費。守琦方面也不答應，這件事就擱僵了。去年也有朋友們勸麗蘭提起法律訴訟，麗蘭却有些不好意思，故而至今延擱著。霍先生，你的意思李守琦也有關係嗎？」　（一二六）</p>

<p>— 唯唯</p>
<p>最近幾年，京朝派伶人南來的機會較多，但是所來的差不多都是後起的人才，老一輩的人物，反而不使人注意，而沒有南來的機會。就拿武生一行來說吧，黃金更新兩家戲院所邀聘南來獻藝的，前後計有高盛麟，吳彥衡，張雲溪，楊盛春，傳德威等人，這些都是近數年才露頭角的角兒，論藝術，雖各有千秋，然而講實際，都不是京朝派武生中頭兒腦兒的人物。</p>
<p>北方武生自楊小樓俞振亭相繼作古，尙和玉年老退休，繼起者頗乏人才，短中取長而論之，當推周瑞安，孫毓堃，茹富蘭三人，此三人後，始能輪到楊盛春，高盛麟輩也。</p>
<p>周瑞安綽號周一腿，其實他的玩藝兒隨便怎麼不好，拿現在的情勢來說，他還是不好中最好的一人。周瑞安有兩點適合武生應有的條件，（一）有相。（說他身材魁梧扮起來有個樣子的意思）（二）有嗓，只此兩點，現下一般後起武生卽無之，瑞安之戲路悉宗小樓，因為小樓賣的是相和嗓，而瑞安恰有此兩種特點，所以他學小樓學得很像，小樓的傑作，他最擅長的是「金錢豹」「落馬湖」「連環套」「惡虎村」等戲，瑞安演戲最大的毛病是「過火」，近年來因為年事的關係，武工方面也稍見退化，這都是他的缺點，然而唱「落馬湖」「連環套」「惡虎村」這一路黃天覇武戲文唱的戲，小樓歿後還是要算他最好。</p>
<p>孫毓堃原名小振亭，他是俞振亭的外甥，戲路原集俞楊二家之長於一爐，因為他也有「相」。他也有「嗓」，一般人認為毓堃之藝，駕乎瑞安之上，實則不然。蓋毓堃之經騐閱歷，以及火候，斷不及瑞安也。毓堃的毛病恰與瑞安相反，就是他演戲喜歡偷懶，以致有「過慍」之弊，而毓堃之長處，反較瑞安多一點，卽其武工結實，因此表面上好像毓堃勝瑞安一籌，毓堃的玩藝兒現在以楊」之成份為多，他也的確得過小樓的指點，不過小樓最負盛名之「連環套」「落馬湖」一路武戲文唱的戲，毓堃並不擅長，毓堃之傑作是「鐵龍山」「狀元印」一路鈎臉戲，和靑石山挑滑車一路靠把戲，這點又與瑞安不同。</p>
<p>至於茹富蘭，雖然也是學的楊派，可是他吃虧個子矮小，而且目患近視，以致演楊派戲，難與周孫輩相較，然而審蘭別有專長，卽擅演武小生戲，演「探莊」「夜奔」「八大錘」等戲，非特周孫輩望塵莫及，可謂武生中首屈一指；且演戲能守成規，不慍不火，身上嘴裏，無一不佳，故此人雖有不及瑞安毓堃之處，亦有超出瑞安毓堃之處。</p>
<p>最近聽說黃金邀妥茹富蘭，而更新又有邀孫毓堃南來接吳素秋後隊之說，同時更悉周瑞安年終亦將與孟小冬同來出演，由此可知海上劇壇已注意到老一輩的武生，所以今天把這三個人拉雜來談談。</p>
<h3 id="c106">孤島的十月史劇 <a href="#c106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>— 阿漢</p>
<p>十月，第二天就是形成一種暴風在雨的恐怖空氣，但是大地鬥爭過來，靑的天，白的日，又是多麼光明燦爛呢！是的，這是一個季節的象徵，象徵着十月的季節是偉大的。在這偉大的十月的季節，我們的劇壇，正也非常光明燦爛，展開史劇季的一頁。</p>
<p>正當新藝劇社獻給千萬觀衆的食糧——「海國英雄」之後，跟著，中旅再度公演「李香君」「，該劇已博極高的評價，啓示士大夫階級在大時代中的動盪性，那樣慘痛，但又那樣積極。</p>
<p>至於上海劇藝社，除了以于伶一年來的心血結晶，「大明英烈傳」公演外，跟着的還有「葛嫩娘」「李秀成殉國」兩部，都是一樣的暴露大時代鬥爭的焦點，啓示一般市民共走的步伐！</p>
<p>站在觀衆的立塲，我們除了以熱烈的情緒迎接十月中的偉大一日之外，對於以上數部富有時代性的史劇，當然也是同樣表示興奮。眞的，我們永遠記着，歷史能够反映時代，時代也就是今後的歷史！</p>

<p>速寫帶排已經花了一年多時間的于伶新作「大明英烈傳」，准今日公演了。它的內容是寫劉伯溫如何號召民衆，並聯絡朱元璋常遇春，揭竿而起，共圖爭取自由的偉業。中間穿揷民衆如何遭受壓迫的痛苦，如何流血犧牲，英烈莊嚴，為有歷史劇以來所未見。担任導演的，是裝置專家徐渠，他除了儘量使演出形式美化之外，在佈景上與實際裝置者池寗，有過一番長期的討論，務必做到創造另一種新的風格，使觀衆耳目為之一新。韓非的演技，在近半年來，有着長足的進步，他在這里飾演劉伯溫，滿口斯文，十分風趣。夏霞飾蘇皎皎，當然很勝任愉快的。徐立飾反派的張良弼，凡是看過，「梁紅玉」和「葛嫩娘」的都知道他擅長這一類的戲。總之劇藝社把「大明英烈傳」當作秋季最大一個劇目看的，所以傾了最大的人力和物力來演這個戲。劇藝社並定即日起舉行從來有過的「歷史劇季」，接連的演出幾個歷史劇，如魏如晦的「葛嫩娘」和陽翰笙的「李秀成殉國」兩劇都是該社的拿手傑作，公演時一定會引起觀衆極大興趣的吧！　假美婦女總會舉行</p>

<p>日前談伶人名有關命運，姓名中平聲多者運佳，已列舉老生名若干，今再舉，旦，凈，丑，小生，武生，老旦，等角之名，以實吾說。</p>
<p>旦角　旦角前輩吳順林，喬蕙蘭，孫采珠，陳德霖三字中皆得二平聲，獨王瑤卿得三平，二陽一陰，晚年男女門生衆多，猶有通天敎主之稱。四大名旦，程荀皆二平，尙只一平，而梅蘭芳獨具三平，故輿論推梅占冠軍，屈尙居龍尾。與梅同時之朱幼芬，王蕙芳，南方之馮子和，賈碧雲，聲名，事功結局，皆不及梅，梅之外彼等名字，只得一二平聲故也。去年先後出演黃金之毛世來，宋德珠，藝術，資格，年歲無不相似，而毛則較紅，毛名二陽平，而宋一，且陰平，毛之名以北方音呼出較響故也？（凡伶人名，須以北方音呼之，逢陰平響，逢陽平更響，若以南方音呼之則相反，不作準，北方音區域廣大，故以北音為準。）更新舞台先後的坤角六人，吳趙梁鄭梁，五人名皆二平，而李硯秀較弱。依吾說，則三字全仄，呼出不響，為最大原因。今黃金戲院正唱之童芷苓，以一紡棉花露紅，又豈非童苓二陽平呼得響亮之力哉？名不響則唱不紅，此之謂也。</p>
<p>大面　郝壽臣，侯喜瑞，為北方凈角之二强，及金少山到，遂拔趙幟立漢幟，輕占魁首，蓋因金有二平，郝侯各一平也。晚出凈角，有王泉奎，劉連榮，皆得三陽平聲，繼少山之後，享大名者，將為些二人焉。或曰：「裘盛戎亦不無希望，」然盛戎之盛字為仄聲，此字大為累，好比神前討籤之「中下」近聞彼有桃色糾紛，正此卦也。</p>

<h3 id="e1">The Situation in Vietnam is Uncertain; French-Japanese Negotiations Continue; Japan Continues to Push Chinese Troops to Maintain Vigilance Along the Border; It is Rumored that the British Government Has Decided to Reopen the Burma Road <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Chongqing, today's Guilin news, Japanese troops are advancing towards the Yunnan border, and their vanguard of ten thousand men has already reached Ke Pei, ninety miles northwest of Lang Son, beyond the border. According to Chinese military reports, the advance of the Japanese vanguard has already been discovered by Chinese troops maintaining vigilance along the Vietnamese border. (Reuters, 3rd)</p>
<p>Guangzhou, a Japanese military spokesman claimed yesterday afternoon that the Japanese troops who landed in Haiphong have reached Dongshan (transliteration). French-Japanese negotiations are currently continuing. It is expected that the Japanese troops will advance towards Hanoi when the negotiations conclude. At present, the Japanese troops are in Lang Son and Dongshan. (Reuters, 3rd)</p>
<p>London, according to today's news, the British government has decided to reopen the Burma Road on October 17th. (Reuters, 3rd)</p>
<p>Chongqing, according to the Guinan war report, the Japanese vanguard is now 25 kilometers away from Geban. It is estimated that 3,500 Japanese troops are advancing towards that area. It is also reported that 38,000 Japanese troops have landed in Haiphong so far, carrying 60 field guns and 60 tanks. (Japanese Reuters)</p>
<p>Chongqing, Chinese people here deeply believe that Britain will soon reopen the Burma Road, and are therefore very happy. Various organizations, including the China-British Cultural Association, the League of Nations Association, and the Chinese branch, recently jointly sent a telegram to the British "Aid China General Committee" to express their gratitude for their efforts to urge the British government to open the Burma Road. As for the proposal of British organizations to form a united front of democratic countries against aggression to continue the war, it is welcomed here. In addition, according to news from London, Britain is rumored to lend a large sum of money to China and send a military mission to Chongqing. People here are very pleased to hear this news. (Havas, 3rd)</p>
<p>London, Reuters' diplomatic correspondent said that when the issue of reopening the Burma Road within the next half month is decided, British-Japanese relations will enter a tense stage. Britain's closure of this road was originally a gesture of appeasement towards Japan. Now that Japan has openly allowed assistance to the Axis powers under certain circumstances, it seems that Britain cannot maintain this posture. (Reuters, 3rd)</p>
<p>Hanoi, as of yesterday, French-Japanese negotiations are still continuing. According to French officials, according to the terms of the Hanoi Agreement of September 22, the Japanese troops have selected three airfields, reportedly the Gia Lam, Phu Tho, and Vu Lan Qi Lang (all transliterations) airfields. According to French sources, they suggested giving the Japanese the French airfield at Lao Cai on the Yunnan-Annam border, but this was not accepted by the Japanese. The three airfields occupied by the Japanese are all north of the Red River. The date of the Japanese occupation of Gia Lam Airport will be October 4. It is expected that the Japanese will send guards from Haiphong to defend the airport. As for the Japanese prisoners captured in the battle of Lang Son, the issue has not yet been resolved. Two Japanese officers have arrived here from Guangzhou and are currently negotiating a resolution to the above issue. However, the wounded French soldiers have been sent to Hanoi by the Japanese, while the uninjured are still detained by the Japanese. Furthermore, according to French officials last night, the situation in Haiphong after the bombing has now returned to normal. (Reuters, 3rd)</p>
<p>Hanoi, according to news from here last night, Nishihara, the former head of the Japanese military delegation to Annam, will leave here within a few days to go to southern Annam for an extended "tour." It is reported that the Annam areas that Nishihara plans to inspect are not those already occupied by the Japanese troops. Furthermore, the Japanese expatriates who previously evacuated to Hainan Island have now returned to Hanoi one after another. Their attitude has obviously changed greatly, such as disregarding local traffic lights and behaving arrogantly, just like the Japanese expatriates commonly seen in Japanese-occupied areas in China. At the same time, General Kakuda, who succeeds Nishihara as the leader of the Japanese military delegation, is expected to arrive here today. (Reuters, 3rd)</p>
<p>Chongqing, a Chinese military spokesman confirmed the news that the Japanese troops in northern Vietnam have reached Gaobang (transliteration) when receiving reporters today, but said that the intention of the Japanese troops occupying the area is unclear. Although the Japanese troops have the possibility of using Gaobang as a base to advance towards the Guizhou and Yunnan provinces along the highway, he believes that the activities of the Japanese troops there may be more related to the situation in Vietnam. The spokesman also said that there is a regiment of Japanese troops in Gaobang, mainly to protect the flanks of the Japanese troops in Lang Son, to prevent the Chinese troops from attacking from the north. (Reuters, 3rd)</p>
<p>Chongqing, a Chinese government spokesman recently said that China's bayonets have been drawn, ready to fight back once the Japanese attack Chinese soil from Gaofeng. The Japanese troops have advanced from Lang Son to occupy Gaofeng, which seems to be invading Chinese territory. Chinese border troops will cross the border into Vietnam when necessary. The spokesman also said that Japanese naval vessels and transports have concentrated in French Guangzhou Bay, which is now entirely under Japanese control. He added that about two Japanese divisions have concentrated in the Lang Son and Haiphong areas of Vietnam, leaving only a small number of Japanese troops stationed in the Nanning area of Guangxi Province. Now the Japanese troops have advanced from Lang Son to Gaofeng, but it is not yet known whether they will attack China to the north. (Reuters, 3rd)</p>
<p>London, today's news said that the British government's decision to reopen the Burma Road was made after exchanging views with Washington. It is also reported that the British government intends to supply gasoline from Burma to China on credit. Political circles believe that the reopening of the Burma Road is enough to show that Britain has begun to end its appeasement policy in the Far East. (Reuters, 3rd)</p>
<p>Chongqing, the Central Daily News published an editorial this morning on the situation in Vietnam by the Chinese and Japanese armies. It said that the Chinese and Japanese armies in the Yangtze River basin, North China, northern Guangdong, and southern Jiangxi are in a stalemate. The plan to invade Sichuan Province from western Hubei has also obviously been abandoned. The Japanese army may now have the possibility of entering Yunnan Province from Vietnam. If we look at the map, the mountains of Tibet extend southward and enter western Yunnan, then extend to Vietnam. The Wuliang Mountains are located in the west, the Aiping Mountains are located in the middle, and the Lujiao Mountains are located in the east. (The above mountain names are all transliterations.) The Lujiao Mountains fold eastward to form the natural boundary between Yunnan and Vietnam. The highest points are up to 3,000 to 4,000 meters. The deep ravines between the mountains all have rapid rivers. The Vietnamese railway enters Yunnan at Lao Cai, passes through the Lujiao Mountains, and reaches Kunming. There are more than 2,000 bridges and tunnels along the way. At present, there are 40,000 Japanese troops stationed in Vietnam, 20,000 landed in Haiphong, and the remaining 20,000 entered from Guangxi. China has destroyed the roads and bridges and the tunnels along the road at Hekou, and dismantled the tracks. Therefore, the Japanese army will encounter great difficulties in advancing along the railway from Hanoi to Lao Cai. The column advancing from Longzhou has been blocked near Geban (transliteration). If the Japanese army intends to invade Yunnan Province, we will give it a devastating blow. But if the Japanese army engages in occupying the entire Vietnam, then this is the funeral of the French, and we will ignore it. (Reuters, 3rd)</p>
<p>Bangkok, last night a large crowd gathered in front of the private residence of Thai Prime Minister Songgram, demanding that the government take a firm stance on Vietnam to achieve the goal of revising the territory. The Prime Minister immediately walked out of the gate and gave a brief speech to the crowd, urging the people to remain calm and wait for a peaceful resolution. According to the Bruce Report here, a large number of refugees have been evacuated from the town of Vithani on the Thai-Vietnamese border to the interior of Vietnam in recent days. It is also reported that a total of 1,000 Annamese and overseas Chinese are staying in the town to prepare for defense. There are 40 aircraft and 10 tanks. Bishop Belli, one of the leaders of the French overseas Chinese in Thailand, has telegraphed the French government, calling for a peaceful resolution of the border dispute. Thailand's largest newspaper, Lastra Daily, published an editorial yesterday, criticizing the French government for accepting the demands of the Japanese while rejecting the demands of Thailand, and emphasizing that if France does not revise the Vietnam-Thai border, Thailand will insist on its realization.

<p>Xingji, on the morning of the 28th of last month, a unit of the Japanese army in the triangular area of southwestern Shanxi took many cars and attacked Yuxiang from Wanquan, drove to the vicinity of Jianjia Village Temple between Rong (He) and Wan, and triggered a Chinese landmine, destroying four Japanese cars. The Chinese ambushes then launched a surprise attack on the Japanese, causing many Japanese casualties. Subsequently, the Japanese reinforcements rushed to join the attack on the Chinese. The Chinese army launched a flanking attack on the Japanese, who were trapped in a three-sided encirclement. After two hours of fighting, they were unable to hold on and collapsed towards Wanquan.

<p>Tongguan, the Japanese army in Monan Town (south of Jiexian) has been besieged by the Chinese army for days, killing more than 600 people. The transportation in the 20-mile ridge area between Jie and Mo has also been cut off by the Chinese, and the Japanese army is increasingly panicked. On the night of the 28th, they broke through to the north, but were intercepted and killed by the Chinese army near Shipo Pond, and retreated back to Monan Town. Now the Chinese are intensifying their efforts to annihilate them. (Telegram, 3rd)</p>

<p>Chongqing, the management rights of the telephone bureau in the Tianjin Concession have been transferred by a special committee organized by the industrial bureaus of various concessions. Upon hearing the news, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs believes that this action by the industrial bureaus of the British, French, and Italian concessions in Tianjin is illegal, not only harming China's rights and interests and violating contractual obligations, but also violating the responsibility of accepting the entrustment and acting as custodian. It has lodged a serious protest to the British, French, and Italian embassies in China yesterday, stating that the above-mentioned transfer of the telephone bureau cannot have legal effect, and the Chinese government still reserves all its rights in this case.

<p>Tunxi, after a certain unit of the Chinese army in Jiangnan advanced towards Jurong, the Japanese army dispatched joint infantry and artillery units from Tianwang Temple, Lishui, and other places on the 26th to counterattack in separate routes. The Chinese army not only used the main force to meet the Japanese army head-on, but also set up ambushes with a small force to intercept the Japanese army. When the Japanese army attacking head-on was defeated by the Chinese army, the Chinese army immediately tracked and advanced, chasing to a certain place. At that time, the Chinese ambushes suddenly rose up and gave them a severe blow. The Japanese army was attacked at both ends and fled in a hurry. Now the Chinese pursuit force has crossed the Beijing-Hangzhou National Highway and advanced to the outskirts of Jurong City, directly approaching the city fortifications. (Telegram, 2nd)</p>

<h3 id="e9">On the Soviet Union and the Far East <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday we learned that: (1) A Soviet spokesman told American reporters that rumors that the Soviet Union would sacrifice China in order to reach an understanding with Japan were absolutely false. (2) German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop is said to be going to Moscow to work to promote the Tripartite Pact and to promote Soviet-Japanese amity. (3) The Japanese side is doing its best to promote Soviet-Japanese rapprochement, and its new ambassador to the Soviet Union has the responsibility of conducting all negotiations. (4) The American side may believe that U.S.-Soviet rapprochement now only has good opportunities in diplomacy, but there are no political reasons for its realization; if the U.S. and the Soviet Union begin negotiations at present, the U.S. is not in a superior position. These pieces of news about the Soviet Union, assuming they can be proven to be true or untrue, will all affect the future of the world situation, and the impact on the Far East will be particularly profound. In yesterday's commentary on the new situation in the Far East, this newspaper said that the Soviet Union is now unwilling to immediately unite with Britain and the United States against Japan, but it will never collude with Germany, Italy and Japan. The current state of diplomatic relations between him and Japan is causing Japan, whose desire to advance south has reached its peak, to stick to a major weakness; at the same time, this is also the focus of the struggle between aggressors and anti-aggressors in the Far East; in the new situation in the Far East, the countries along the Pacific Ocean will not be able to remain absolutely detached from the situation in the future, and the Soviet Union is the most decisive factor among them. Based on this commentary, and evidenced by the aforementioned news, it further reflects what a role the Soviet Union is playing on the international stage in the future. For the sake of the world situation, we certainly hope that the Soviet Union will step onto the stage and play a positive role; but for the Soviet Union, in addition to some opportunistic moves, at least in the near future, it will take a calm and watchful attitude. This is our consistent observation. His so-called peaceful neutrality is subjective and time-sensitive; and the two-sided turmoil in Western Europe and East Asia makes his peaceful neutrality only a temporary state, but he has to bury himself in the most active preparations while calmly observing the situation. The recent large-scale exercises by the Soviet Navy outside Vladivostok and the new tactical exercises by the Army and Air Force are by no means merely for newspapers and films to use as propaganda materials; and after the announcement of the Tripartite Pact, he unofficially expressed his continued maintenance of peace and neutrality, which can only be regarded as the new attitude not yet launched. Now there is a possibility that the European war will evolve into a new situation, and the Pacific Ocean is likely to have big waves at any time. The Soviet Union will definitely not remain the same and will not make any plans. What will the situation be at that time is certainly not something that can be asserted at present; but there are things that can be observed separately. What the Soviet Union has to deal with, broadly speaking, seems to be dealing with the two changes in Western Europe and East Asia at the same time, but the two sides are different and cannot be equated. In Europe, regardless of how close or estranged the Soviet Union is to the two sides currently at war, how it suppresses or promotes the situation, it is only because the Soviet Union's basic understanding of this war is that it is an equal struggle for hegemony, so the so-called closeness, estrangement, suppression, and promotion are nothing more than strategies made according to the times; when the time passes and the situation changes, the Soviet Union will have to make adjustments according to the circumstances. Not only is the Soviet Union's understanding like this, but after the European war is divided into victory and defeat, the impact on the Soviet Union will inevitably be a mixture of interests and harms; that is, no matter who wins or loses, it will be impossible for the Soviet Union to feel safe and stable from then on. As for the East Asian war situation, whether in terms of its nature, facts, or the Soviet Union's understanding, it is not the so-called equal struggle for hegemony, but a contest between militarism and peace: in the future, one victory and one defeat, one decline and one growth, will make the Soviet Union directly feel that it can live in peace from then on, or that it will be troublesome and dangerous from then on. Because China after victory, said to impose any coercion on the Soviet Union, must be something that both China and the Soviet Union agree is absolutely unimaginable. From the completely different nature and future of the European and Asian situations, it can be inferred that what the Soviet Union is currently calmly observing and actively preparing to deal with is also completely different for the East and the West. Although the international evolution has become clearer from obscurity due to the Tripartite Pact, within the clarity, it will still create disparate consequences depending on the degree and timing of the actions of all parties. Who dares to assert that everything that has not yet been implemented will become a reality. For example, Britain in the Far East, we firmly believe that it has realized the futility of compromise and has the urge to abandon compromise; but what its actions will be in the near future will still shift depending on its degree of psychological self-confidence, and will still shift depending on its assessment of the future of the English Channel battle. For example, the United States in the Far East, we firmly believe that its policy will be far-reaching, firm, and consistent; but when it is implemented, who can guarantee that it will be able to gradually understand the opportunity. Therefore, all this is likely to give the Soviet Union, which is calmly observing the situation, some influence. Observing Britain and the United States, it seems that within the scope of the Far East issue, they have some expectations for the Soviet Union; we feel that this kind of expectation inevitably has the error of reversing the cause and effect and the guest and host; because the Soviet Union seems to be [the mystery of the world], in fact, the Soviet Union's attitude towards the Far East is so clear that Britain and the United States do not need to have any new expectations for this; on the contrary, whether the Soviet Union is willing to go further and have better actions in the Far East, probably after Britain and the United States resolutely take action. On the other hand, the Soviet Union's possible actions on the European situation have a broad perspective, and perhaps when this [mystery of the world] is revealed again, it can shock the world again. But in the Far East, no matter how Japan attempts to woo the Soviet Union, how much it promises, no matter how Germany acts as an intermediary for Japan, it is also very possible that what kind of agreement will be established between the Soviet Union and Japan; but it can be firmly believed that its content, at most, is related to the future situation of the Pacific Ocean, or is only limited to solving simple problems between the Soviet Union and Japan; if it is said that the Soviet Union participates in the Tripartite Pact, if it is said that the Soviet Union accepts Japan's desire to end the so-called China Incident as soon as possible, then it is something that reality will definitely not allow. The Soviet Union has a decisive role in the Far East in terms of strength, but strength must be effective when it is launched, and the Soviet Union is currently only assisting China, and will not have any kind of launch for the time being. To launch everything, first look at Britain and the United States.</p>
<h3 id="e10">The United States Will Establish an Atlantic Patrol Fleet; The Commander-in-Chief of the Navy Will Go to Washington to Discuss the Chaotic Situation in the Far East <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>The Washington Navy Department announced yesterday that 125 warships in the Atlantic will be temporarily expanded to form a new patrol force. The reason for the establishment of the new patrol force is to improve the efficiency of work and training. It is said that the new patrol force will include various naval air squadrons in the Atlantic. The fleet will be under the control of Admiral Lee Richardson, Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Navy, and the direct commander will be Vice Admiral Ellis, Commander of the Atlantic Fleet. Before this announcement was issued, Captain Knox stated that he had summoned General Lee Richardson to Washington next week to discuss the chaotic situation in the Far East. When commenting on rumors that the United States may send several warships to Australia and New Zealand, Captain Knox said that he had heard unofficial people raise this issue, and he thought this idea was not bad, but he solemnly stated that the official has not made any decision on this matter. When someone asked him if he was satisfied with the U.S. naval base in the Pacific, he said, "I am not satisfied with anything, because I hope everything can be improved." It is obvious that the U.S. naval base in the Pacific can still be improved. (Reuters, 3rd) Washington, the U.S. Navy Department announced that in addition to having a strong fleet stationed in the Pacific, it also plans to establish a newly formed fleet in the Atlantic. The fleet will be established soon, with more than 125 warships, including some originally stationed in the Atlantic, some newly built, some re-commissioned, and some converted for naval use. It has not been announced whether the decision to strengthen the Atlantic Fleet this time is due to the new pact signed by Germany, Italy, and Japan, but people generally believe that this is the first step in establishing a two-ocean navy. According to official language, the main purpose of this new order is to unify command and strengthen the defense of the east coast. (Reuters, 3rd) Washington, the U.S. Navy will soon establish an Atlantic patrol force composed of various types of warships as part of the U.S. fleet.

<p>Cleveland - Republican presidential candidate Willkie, in a recent campaign speech here, stated that Germany, Italy, and Japan all believe the United States intends to go to war, and all recognize the United States as a powerful nation. Willkie criticized President Roosevelt for treating politics as a game, causing the opposition of totalitarian states to the United States. He said the New Deal only watches Hitler's progress and lacks appropriate steps to prepare to protect the United States. Before the United States possesses sufficient military strength, it must not invite aggressors to form an agreement against it. This statement seemed aimed at the recently formed Tripartite Pact. He also assured that if elected, he would continue to work to aid heroic Britain, the only nation in the world fighting for freedom with its life. "I will work to help Britain, even if it delays our country's air force construction. I want to help Britain because if Britain can hold on, our country will have ample time to prepare." He emphasized, "The American people must not think of war, must not have the heart to join any war in the Pacific or Atlantic Oceans. Now is the time for the American people to stop emotional displays and fervent praise. The American people should immerse themselves in building their army, navy, and especially intensify the construction of their air force." (United Press, 3rd)</p>

<h3 id="e12">Guangdong Implements Relay Station System to Save Gasoline Consumption, Increasing Hunan Rice Supply <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>Hong Kong - To counter the French blockade of Vietnam and the British suspension of supplies from the Yunnan-Burma Road, and to save gasoline consumption, Guangdong Province has adopted a new relay station transportation system as part of the national transportation network. The Guangdong provincial government has allocated 300,000 yuan to implement this system. The direct effect of this system is to increase the supply of Hunan rice. It is reported that the province is currently collecting taxes, and Hunan Province Chairman General Xue Yue has expressed his determination to eliminate rice hoarders. Therefore, Hunan rice sold to Guangdong Province may still be obtained at a low price. The relay station system of the past, after twenty-eight years, has been revived. This system will be implemented on 14,019 kilometers of highways and old waterways. Both highways and waterways will have several relay stations, each equipped with a number of weight-bearing animals, small boats, civilian ships, freight vehicles, and drivers. The authorities will adopt an alternating transportation system, where goods will be transported from one station to another without interruption, just like in ancient times. Guangdong Province hopes that each relay station can transport 10 tons of goods daily, and later increase it to 30 tons daily. According to statistics, if each station transports 10 tons daily, 77,768 porters and drivers are needed. If the goods reach 30 tons, this number of laborers must also increase to 233,304. The distance between each station will allow porters to return within a day, and the weight carried by each porter and animal will be based on the principle of not causing them to be immediately exhausted. This revived relay station system will allow the provincial government to prevent the smuggling of Japanese goods from Huizhou Dapeng Bay and Mozes Bay. Matches, tobacco, wax, and cotton yarn are smuggled through the Dongjiang area. The smuggling of opium is also said to occur through this route. (United International News, 3rd)</p>

It is expected that there will be no more changes in the government in the near future.

It is difficult to be competent for the position of a war cabinet member. For the benefit of the country, the Prime Minister should submit a letter of resignation on his behalf and ask the King to appoint another virtuous person to avoid delaying public affairs. Churchill replied, saying that Your Excellency’s illness was caused by serving the country. I have long been worried that Your Excellency may be tired. I and all the cabinet members admire the firmness and understanding of the former Prime Minister’s will. I all know that Your Excellency has dedicated his life to seeking the well-being of the United Kingdom. Now that Your Excellency has the wish to resign and recuperate, I cannot refuse your request, but I will do my best to find a successor, so that the cabinet will not suffer a major loss.

<p>London - The British government has decided to temporarily suspend the plan to send British children overseas again. The sinking of the Benares City, which was sailing to Canada, by a German submarine in the Atlantic Ocean, resulting in the death of many British children on board, proves that in the current weather conditions in the Atlantic, passenger ships, even if escorted, are still quite dangerous. The government has decided that it cannot be responsible for sending British children overseas during the wild winter. However, the government's plan to evacuate children is suspended, not abandoned. Whether it will be possible to resume sending them next year will depend on the situation at that time. According to reports, about 2,650 children have been sent overseas, and they have received very good treatment. The British government knows that the public hopes that their children will be sent overseas, and will be disappointed, and expresses its gratitude to the many people in the Dominions and the United States who have generously taken in British children. However, for the benefit of the British children themselves, the British government has decided to temporarily suspend the sending. This measure will definitely be forgiven by relatives and friends overseas. (Reuters, 3rd)</p>

However, what these countries should understand is that the more they interfere with Japan, the firmer Japan's determination to implement its plan becomes. Currently, Britain and the United States still have the opportunity to consider avoiding this unnecessary international friction. If these two countries do not reflect and further impose embargoes on Japan's oil, rubber, tin, and other products, Japan will not hesitate to fight them. (Associated Press, 3rd)</p>
<p>Hong Kong - A Tokyo dispatch reported that the Asahi Shimbun said in an editorial on the 3rd that if Britain and the United States adopt more economic suppression policies against Japan, Japan will never sit idly by. If the scope of the US embargo expands to oil, and Britain and its Dominions also prohibit the shipment of tin and rubber to Japan, Japan will wage a battle for survival. Japan is not eager to create international friction, but in order to establish the "East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere", it will complete this basic national policy regardless of all obstacles in the process. This article in the Asahi Shimbun, entitled "The Response of Britain and the United States to the Tripartite Pact", commented on the speech given by US Undersecretary of State Welles in Cleveland on September 28. The newspaper stated that Welles' conciliatory words cannot indicate that the United States' Far East policy has also weakened. It is reported that the commissioners stationed in London from Canada, Australia, and New Zealand have held meetings with the British authorities on the implementation of economic suppression against Japan.

The Soviet authorities' slogan is to completely eliminate all fascists, who are considered enemies of the people. (Reuters dispatch, 3rd)</p>

<p>Rome – Italian journalist Gayda published an article in the Italian News yesterday, commenting on British propaganda that the German-Italian-Japanese pact is aimed not only at Britain and the United States but also at the Soviet Union, declaring that Italian-Soviet friendship is permanent in nature. Since Italy recognized the Soviet Union on February 7, 1924, the two countries signed a non-aggression pact in 1933, guaranteeing that they would never wage war against each other. The Italian government has never supported a policy of isolating Soviet Russia. (Haitong Press dispatch, 3rd)</p>
<h3 id="e37">Rumors of Germany Postponing Invasion of Britain; British Side Considers This Unreliable <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>London – Reuters diplomatic correspondent has learned that German officials recently told Japanese journalists stationed in Berlin that Germany has postponed its invasion plans of Britain. Because the country's military and foreign policy positions have been strengthened by the new German-Italian-Japanese alliance, there is no longer a need to rush the invasion. Many British experts have long known that Germany would repeatedly deliberate before hastily invading Britain. However, the reasons Germany now offers for postponing the invasion plan are not credible. If the British navy, army, and air force were insignificant, it would have been advantageous for Germany to proceed with its plan this summer. Germany's current statement has other meanings. For example, if Germany's position has been strengthened, it is obviously not directed at Britain. Germany previously acted as a guarantor for Romania, saying that the source of trouble was the Soviet Union. Now that Germany's power has increased, will it threaten the Soviet Union, or will it seek cooperation with the Soviet Union? This situation should become clear within a few days, but at present, it is still uncertain. This is why German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop's whereabouts are being kept secret. The German claim that Ribbentrop is visiting somewhere near Berlin has not been confirmed. (Reuters dispatch, 3rd)</p>

<p>Berlin – Official sources claim that German planes have been flying continuously towards British airfields since yesterday and this morning, launching the most extensive air raids since the start of the war. The German air force's sudden change in strategy, attacking British air force bases, aims to prevent British planes from attacking the European continent. One statement claimed that several British seaports were damaged, and several factories caught fire. German sources also claim that about twenty British centers, including London, Liverpool, Chester, and others, were bombed and set ablaze. (International News Service dispatch, 3rd)</p>
<p>London – German planes attacked the London area again last night, but intense artillery fire prevented them from reaching central London, and they were driven back just as they reached the suburbs. The alarm was lifted, and London's traffic returned to normal. Shortly afterward, the alarm sounded again, and bombs fell on open countryside. According to an Air Ministry communiqué, a town on the coast of Sussex was bombed yesterday evening, damaging houses and shops, with some casualties. (Reuters dispatch, 3rd)</p>
<p>London – This morning, the Air Ministry and the Cabinet Security Department issued a communiqué stating that enemy planes again concentrated their attacks on London and southeastern England last night. Two locations in Scotland were hit with incendiary bombs, causing minor damage. High-explosive bombs and incendiary bombs fell on the northwest of England, causing several fires, which were extinguished, with slight damage to houses and very few casualties. Enemy planes indiscriminately dropped bombs in several areas of London, but according to reports, damage was limited, and casualties were minor. Several incidents occurred in southeastern England, with high-explosive and incendiary bombs hitting several locations and causing some fires, which were quickly extinguished. Today, a German bomber was shot down near Hertford, and the four German crew members were captured and disarmed by workers and farmers. The city of Midland suffered its first air raid of the war, with factories and a primary school being hit. Fortunately, rescue was swift, and many schoolchildren and workers were rescued from the rubble. (Reuters dispatch, 3rd)</p>
<p>London – During last night's intense air raid, German planes seemed to adopt new tactics to penetrate central London. However, the formidable British anti-aircraft batteries quickly dispersed most of the German formations. Most of yesterday daytime was quiet, but at night, formations of German planes swarmed from all directions, first circling outside the city and then suddenly turning towards the center, attempting to break through and bomb their targets. However, strong British anti-aircraft guns immediately fired on the German formations, preventing them from succeeding. Eventually, no German planes were visible in the London sky last night. The anti-aircraft fire last night was the most intense in recent days.</p>
<p>German war reports, the alert began at 8:30 p.m., and within minutes of the alarm sounding, London residents had taken shelter in basements for the long night. During the day yesterday, German planes also attacked London with great intensity. However, the daytime raiders were at least repelled by British defenses. The German planes only managed to drop three bombs in southeast London during the fifth daytime raid. During the sixth raid, which began at 5 p.m., the German planes that engaged with British planes found it difficult to fly into central London. (Associated Press dispatch, 2nd)</p>
<p>London – British anti-aircraft guns and searchlights, using new defense methods to counter new attack methods, have defeated German planes attempting to penetrate central London. The terrifying anti-aircraft fire has proven more than adequate in dealing with large formations of German planes attacking London from all directions. Thwarted from entering central London by the rain of shells, German planes scattered incendiary and explosive bombs in the London suburbs and surrounding areas during the second raid last night. Only a few German planes penetrated central London. London's new defense method is to fire heavily with special heavy anti-aircraft guns and illuminate the sky with searchlights, creating a sheet of light, supplemented by intense light anti-aircraft fire. At least two German planes were shot down before midnight last night. A famous school in southeastern England was burned down, and the fire threatened a nearby Saxon church. (Associated Press dispatch, 3rd)</p>
<p>London – More than a thousand German planes attacked London and other centers in Britain almost continuously in the last 24 hours. This morning, British officials said that, apart from several large fires in London, the damage was light. (International dispatch, 3rd)</p>
<p>London – Official sources claim that British fighter planes, bravely defending London, displayed their prowess yesterday, intercepting and dispersing several waves of German planes that attacked London throughout the day. If the German air force hoped to destroy British fighter defenses with yesterday's raids, it has failed again. The Air Ministry announced that, according to reports so far, nine German planes were shot down, and the British air force lost only one fighter. Of the attacking German planes (unofficially estimated to be over two hundred), very few penetrated the London area. Bombing caused light material damage and casualties. London sounded the alarm six times yesterday. Several German planes were intercepted over East London, and observers watched as British fighters surrounded the enemy planes, converged together, and then swooped down to attack them front and rear. The enemy planes frantically broke formation and fled towards the coast of Kent. German planes dropped bombs on the districts of Kent both on the way to and from London. The air activity started at 8 a.m., with single German planes making several raids from the south and east coasts, staying briefly before leaving. A few bombs fell in several places in southwestern England, Wales, and Essex, causing slight material damage and casualties. Another formation of German planes, including three Messerschmitt fighters, flying back over inland Britain, fired on three ships off the east coast and attempted to attack a barrage balloon but were driven off by anti-aircraft fire. The fishing boat that was attacked zig-zagged and then continued on its way. A Dornier German plane, flying over a town in Essex, strafed the streets, but was intercepted minutes later by a Hurricane British fighter returning from patrol over the North Sea. The German plane tried to hide in the clouds, but several British planes chased and strafed it, shooting it down near a searchlight battery twenty miles away. The four German crew members were captured by the searchlight battery personnel. The Hurricane plane that helped shoot down the German plane also landed nearby, and when the pilot got out of the plane to inspect it, the searchlight battery personnel were surprised to find that the pilot was small in stature, only four feet three inches tall, said to be one of the smallest pilots in the British Air Force.

<p>London – The Air Ministry announced that British planes attacked targets in Germany and occupied countries this morning, and the planes attacked Stuttgart, dropping bombs and hitting a large oil factory, causing a fire with thick smoke rising straight up. The coastal ports that had already been heavily damaged were bombed again, causing large fires and continuous explosions. British bombers arriving in batches later used the light visible from sixty miles away to find their targets and bomb them again. The bombed areas stretched from the Ruhr and Rhine regions as far as Berlin. It is now known that when the British Air Force attacked Berlin, it concentrated on bombing the northwestern suburbs, which manufacture heavy machinery, and the bombs hit their targets, causing terrible explosions.

<p>Berlin – According to a supplementary talk to the German war report released by the military headquarters, German planes continued to bomb military targets in central and southern England. The industrial center of Manchester was bombed for the first time, indicating that German air force activity has expanded. Manchester is the third-largest city in Britain, after London and Glasgow, with a canal to Liverpool that can accommodate 11,000-ton ships. Manchester's oil depot has a capacity of 600,000 tons and is the second-largest oil depot in Britain. German planes bombed the city's port and factories. German planes continued to bomb military targets in London, causing explosions and large fires. German Air Force Major Hahn hit the British Carru airfield, destroying several hangars and many planes on the field. All German planes returned safely. One German plane bombed an armory in Essex one evening, dropping several bombs on the southeast of the factory, causing severe damage. Another German plane attacked an airfield near the factory, completely destroying it. British planes bombed western Germany one evening but did not hit military targets, only destroying many houses. The number of casualties has not yet been determined. British planes flew to the outskirts of Berlin but were driven back by German anti-aircraft batteries. Several British planes bypassed Berlin and dropped bombs in eastern Germany, mostly hitting empty ground, only hitting a brick and tile factory in the countryside. Seventeen British planes were shot down, one of which was shot down by anti-aircraft guns. German anti-aircraft batteries within the borders of France and Belgium shot down many British planes, totaling twenty-four. (Haitong dispatch, 2nd)</p>
<p>Berlin – This afternoon, the German war report stated that the German Air Force attacked London and military facilities in southern and central England yesterday. Railways in central London were heavily bombed throughout the day. Countless planes were destroyed in British airfields. Factories, freighters, and oil tanks in Goosehaven, Newton, and Weymouth were hit by huge bombs. A British freighter berthed at the southern tip of Ireland had its engine room hit by a bomb, and the cargo on deck caught fire. German submarines led by Lieutenant Reiners sank eight armed enemy merchant ships, totaling 42,644 tons, in one voyage. The 14,172-ton British ship "Highland Patriot" was sunk. Enemy military aircraft flew over various districts of the northwestern borders of Germany and the occupied territories and dropped bombs, but German military targets were not damaged. A factory that had stopped operating was hit. Enemy planes attempted to enter Berlin but were repelled by German anti-aircraft fire and turned elsewhere. Anti-aircraft guns north of Berlin shot down a British plane. In total, six enemy planes were destroyed yesterday, and seven German planes went missing. Major Petersen's fighter squadron sank enemy merchant ships totaling 90,000 tons and damaged enemy ships totaling 40,000 tons in six weeks. (Haitong dispatch, 3rd)</p>

<p>London – News arriving here today states that the war in Africa, attacking Britain from the side, is now being commanded by Germany. Military experts believe that Africa has become the main theater of war between Britain and its enemies. It is said that the main target of the Axis powers' attack is the Suez Canal, and the war of attacking Britain, undertaken by Italian forces, is now being commanded strategically by German forces. The shift of the main battlefield to Africa may indicate a temporary postponement of the plan to invade Britain. News from Berlin states that Japanese reporters there have obtained official information that the German High Command has temporarily abandoned the attempt to land German troops in Britain. However, military operations in Europe have not slackened. Last night, Germany sent six hundred planes in succession to attack Britain, while the coastal artillery of Britain and Germany roared like thunder, continuing their conflict across the strait. British planes are also busy bombing Italian positions in Africa and also bombing Berlin and other German targets on the continent. (International News Service dispatch, 3rd)</p>
<p>Aden – Yesterday, Italian planes made their thirty-second attempt to raid Aden, but there was no material damage. Only one Italian plane entered the city of Aden, and it was forced to fly very high by fire from warships, and the bombs it dropped caused no harm. A British fighter plane attacked and strafed the Italian plane, and the Italian plane was seen descending smoking. Of the Italian planes that have attacked, only sixteen have managed to reach the eastern district of Aden, killing seventeen people. The main targets on land have suffered no damage. Italian propaganda is now despised by the Arabs. The Italian claim that Aden had been reduced to rubble initially caused great distress among people in remote parts of the desert, but they learned that Aden residents regarded the bomb craters as curiosities and competed to collect shrapnel to sell as souvenirs. Thus, grief turned to joy, and disgust arose towards the Italian lies. Residents of coastal towns and villages on Aden Island gather in front of loudspeakers every night to listen to the news. When the reporters mention the Italians, they murmur curses at them, calling them "the scourge of God," and they have great trust in the British. Last night, at the request of a Muslim leader, a British official broadcast a prayer in Arabic, asking God to bless those who observe the Muslim Ramadan. Ramadan has now begun and will last until the new moon appears early next month. (Reuters dispatch, 3rd)</p>

<h3 id="e45">European War Talks (17): The Failure of German Air Raids on England <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>This article is a report from the London correspondent of the Christian Science Monitor newspaper. It is translated and recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Germany cannot achieve overwhelming air superiority over England as it did in the blitzkriegs against Poland, the Netherlands, Belgium, and France. The success of the British air force in aerial combat is evident. For example, on August 18, when the German air force launched a massive bombing raid on London with 600 aircraft, the British air force shot down 141 German planes, while the British losses were only 22. The ratio is extremely noticeable. London residents, like those on the English coast, have shown that they can cope with this problem. Moreover, Germany's attempt to strike at the heart of England and its British Empire is not only extremely costly but also strategically ineffective.</p>
<p>The success of the British air force in aerial combat does not depend solely on the number of enemy aircraft shot down, although this number is important. Since August 8, when the German air force launched its major bombing campaign against England, it has suffered severe losses, as confirmed by definitive facts. From August 8, when large-scale daytime bombing of England began, until September 16, Germany had lost 1,799 aircraft, a number verified by various sources. In addition, 800 German aircraft were destroyed, although not officially confirmed by the British. During this period, approximately 6,000 German pilots were killed or captured, while British aircraft losses were only 618, with 292 pilots surviving. This number includes aircraft destroyed in Germany and those lost while scouting the North Sea and other areas. Overall, before August 6, Britain had shot down 3,021 German aircraft, many of which were fighters. British sources estimate that, by that time, Germany had lost approximately 9,000 pilots.</p>
<p>Leaving aside the numbers, what is more noteworthy is that the Anglo-German air war has proven that superiority does not belong to Germany, but to Britain. During the eight days of major German attacks on Britain, German aircraft flew in numbers of hundreds or more, at least twice exceeding 1,000. The German damage. This opinion is not based solely on British communiqués; experienced neutral observers also share this view.</p>
<p>Germany had approximately three objectives in its air raids on England: first, to implement an aerial blockade to complement the submarine and torpedo boat blockade at sea. Second, to achieve an invasion of the British coast through air raids, especially by destroying the British air force through air combat and destroying airfields and aircraft factories. Third, to undermine British morale by indiscriminately attacking non-military areas, disrupting transportation, and inflicting other damage to the national resistance.</p>
<p>Regarding the first objective, the German aerial blockade has failed, and Germany's current abandonment of this objective is clear evidence. Germany's air raids on England, initially focused on commercial ports, harbors, escort vessels, and dockyards, have now largely shifted to inland bombing. According to impartial neutral observers who have personally inspected various important commercial ports in England, and as confirmed by the shipping and food authorities, we can conclude that the German aerial blockade has no hope of success. Furthermore, recent daytime raids by German bombers are even less successful than previous nighttime raids. British air force fighters, with the assistance of anti-aircraft guns, barrage balloons, and the cooperation of air force units, have made German air raids merely a serious nuisance.</p>
<p>Germany's second objective was to achieve overwhelming superiority over the British air force. If the figures released by the Nazi propaganda ministry were credible, the German air force would certainly have achieved this goal. However, the outcome of the air war is difficult to determine. But the British "Spitfire" and "Hurricane" aircraft have shown undeniable superiority over any type of German aircraft flying to England for combat.</p>
<p>Regarding the bombing of British airfields, the British authorities do not deny that several airfields have been severely attacked by German aircraft. The extent of the damage is a military secret and cannot be disclosed. However, it can be said that the German bombing has not, at least, rendered any airfields unusable by the British air force. The situation is similar regarding the German air force's bombing of British aircraft factories. Although a small number of aircraft factories have been hit by German bombs, the extent of the damage is far less than the target that Germany sought to achieve with a large number of aircraft. According to reliable estimates, the time lost in factories due to German air raids is only about one-tenth of that inflicted by British aircraft on Germany.</p>
<p>Regarding the third objective of German air raids, the German air force's attempt to undermine British morale has been even more obviously a failure. The best recent example is the German attack on London. According to German radio broadcasts, the German air force intended to raze most of the area near the British capital to the ground, thereby demoralizing London. However, the reality is far from this. Small parts of the London suburbs suffered considerable damage, and there were many deaths and injuries. A station in the suburbs was hit, and three lines of traffic were affected. , not . Work was immediately underway, the lines were cleared, and traffic was restored as usual.</p>
<p>The reporter happened to be on a train on that traffic line during the air raid. His eyewitness account is as follows:</p>
<p>"After the alarm sounded loudly, most of the passengers walked out of the carriages, leaving only four of us on the train. Between two stations, there was a sudden series of impacts. The train stopped, and we waited in the carriage, hearing planes flying overhead, and hearing several bombs explode and machine guns firing, and a plane flew over the railway line and opened fire with machine guns. After the plane passed over the line, the noise subsided.</p>
<p>The person sitting in the corner of the carriage said, "I think that's all the impact the air raid will have on us."</p>
<p>"After a while, we sat in the dark, feeling bored, so we opened the window and pulled up the curtains. We couldn't see anything, only some half-dots in front of us. During this time, we gathered together and joked, and soon the train started moving again.</p>
<p>"After about half a mile, we arrived at the bombed station. The glass was shattered, and next to the moon , we saw a carriage with many bullet holes, wooden , , and on the street below, a row of shops had also been bombed.</p>
<p>"On the other hand, about a quarter of a mile further down, several houses had been hit by bombs. Firefighters and police were working. During our hour and a half stay, the fire had been extinguished and the streets cleared, leaving a deep impression.</p>
<p>"The town nearby looked very calm. Most of the passengers got off the train to inspect the damage, but they heard the station shouting loudly: 'No one was injured this time!'</p>
<p>"Later, a man whose house had been destroyed said, "The bombing only destroyed our houses; it didn't destroy a single factory."</p>
<p>A more obvious counter-evidence to prove the inaccuracy of Germany's claim that London life has been disrupted is that English cricket is still being played as usual on the grounds and in the village meadows. Even if the game is interrupted for a moment, it resumes immediately after the alert is lifted.</p>
<p>From the reporter's experience of several air raids in southeastern England, and in conversations with the British people after the air raids, it is clear that British morale has not declined.</p>
<p>Although German aircraft bombed indiscriminately areas that were not targets, it still did not help the experiment. (End)</p>

<p>Reuters, Washington, 3rd: US Naval Secretary Knox stated yesterday at a press conference that the United States has no plans to increase the Asian fleet's Yangtze River patrol in China or increase troop strength in the Philippines due to recent developments. The Navy Department also does not wish to withdraw the current 1,000 sailors stationed in Shanghai. The United States has not conducted any negotiations with Britain regarding the use of the strategic port of Singapore. However, a mission representing the British government and the US Army and Navy is scheduled to go to San Diego this week to standardize the aircraft manufactured for Britain and the US by Consolidated Aircraft Corporation. A standard design has already been determined for the Curtiss-Wright fighter aircraft by the British Air Force and the US Army. The policy of standardizing aircraft designs required by Britain and the US now applies to all types of aircraft.</p>
<p>United Press International, Washington, 3rd: US Secretary of the Navy Colonel Knox stated that the issue of joint British-US use of the Singapore naval base is being gathered. He also stated that the government is not preparing to withdraw the 1,500 US Marines stationed in Shanghai but also does not intend to strengthen the US Asian fleet or Yangtze River patrol force.</p>
<p>Granting Huge Loans; Embargoing Scrap Iron</p>
<p>According to a recent commentary in the Closely Observed Times regarding the issue of British-American cooperation, its main points are as follows: Japan and Germany signed a military-economic alliance on the 27th of last month, which is a major change in the Pacific that has been taking place for years. On September 25, the United States announced a $25 million loan to China; on September 26, the US President completely banned the export of scrap iron. It remains questionable whether these two developments accelerated Japan's decision to join the Axis alliance, as these negotiations had been underway for some time, and Japan had already decided to join the alliance.</p>
<p>British-American Cooperation Can Restrain Japan</p>
<p>Japan's primary task is to end the war against China in order to carry out its southward advance policy. Its biggest obstacle is the United States. The US is now cooperating closely with Britain in the Far East. Reducing this obstacle is also Japan's current task. The United States has long been in negotiations with the Soviet Union for cooperation. Japan is also flirting with the Soviet Union. A Japanese newspaper has even proposed that the Soviet Union and Japan divide China and conclude a non-aggression treaty. The Soviet Union has remained silent on this matter, but Soviet Ambassador to the US, Oumansky, has now consulted with the US Secretary of State.</p>
<p>The More Crises, the Closer the Cooperation</p>
<p>New crises are rapidly unfolding in the Pacific. The new Axis alliance will promote British-American cooperation in the Pacific. The closer British-American cooperation in safeguarding their interests in the Far East becomes, the faster the situation will develop. People on both sides of the Pacific have long been aware of this situation. An editorial in the Tokyo Asahi Shimbun on September 27 pointed out that, on the one hand, Japan must overcome the obstacles to establishing its East Asian revival and resolving the Sino-Japanese Incident, and on the other hand, the United States must prevent Japan from succeeding, be hostile to Japan, and insist on interfering in the Far East.</p>
<p>US Determined to Maintain Interests in the Far East</p>
<p>The same tough stance has been seen in both Britain and the United States. US Undersecretary of State Welles declared that the United States is determined to maintain the legitimate rights and interests of its citizens in the Far East, maintain the dignity of the treaties to which the United States is a party, and stated that the United States is prepared in case of emergency. An official in London told a United Press International reporter that Britain, after a year of war, has taken a tougher stance and is determined not to pursue a policy of appeasement towards Japan. Japan also knows what the current problem is, admonishing its people to work diligently. Prime Minister Konoe broadcast to the nation last Saturday, saying that Japan is facing an unprecedented emergency and "cannot tolerate its citizens having 'beautiful clothes and luxurious food.'" Japanese Minister of the Army Tojo issued an order to the army on the same day, saying, "The path to completing Japan's self-preservation is full of difficulties. Never before in history has there been such a need for national cooperation as today."</p>

<p>According to a statement released by the Shanghai Municipal Council's Health Department, after the recent heavy rains flooded parts of the city, some people believed that this would have an impact on public health and consulted the Health Department. This flood, apart from the risk of catching a cold, has little impact on public health. However, one point to note is that vegetables planted in gardens are inevitably exposed to infectious substances due to the flood. As for general residences, the flood was so brief that it did not allow various pollutants to enter.</p>

<p>The weather in the city cleared yesterday, but the Huangpu River experienced another high tide at noon, reaching 13 feet 3 inches, which was even higher than the previous day. It almost reached the level of the Bund and submerged the low-lying areas on the shore. The Jianghai Customs Inspection Station was flooded by three inches. As a result, the low-lying roads in the city are still flooded and the accumulated water cannot be drained, and is being backflowed. The middle section of Avenue Joffre in the French Concession, from Route Albert to Route Massenet, is over a foot deep. The area around Rue Cardinal Mercier and Pont de Zhengjia is also about a foot deep. The tramways in the French Concession were unable to operate due to the obstruction of the current in the tracks. Public buses continued to be rerouted.</p>
<p>Tomorrow's Tide Level</p>
<p>The Huangpu River has experienced high tides for several consecutive days. According to the predictions of the Huangpu Conservancy Bureau, the high tide will occur at 1:45 PM today, reaching 11.58 feet. There will be another high tide on the 4th, at 2:02 AM, reaching 11 feet, and at 2:20 PM, reaching 11.7 feet, which will be the highest peak. Afterwards, it will gradually subside. When the tide rises, the roads will be flooded, causing flooding.</p>
<p>Estimated Losses</p>
<p>According to the North China Daily News, the losses suffered in the city due to the torrential rains and flooding in the past two days amount to hundreds of millions of dollars. Qualified observers claim that the extent of the losses can only be estimated after the water has receded and the situation has returned to normal. The aforementioned losses include damage to public buildings, sewers, and goods stored in warehouses. Based on</p>
<p>Conservative Estimates</p>
<p>On Tuesday alone, the two concessions, covering a total area of 8,109 acres, received 1,440,000,000 gallons of rainfall. At 8:12, an official from the Municipal Council's Works Department stated that the flooding was caused by heavy rain and high tides. The Municipal Council built a seawall on the Bund several years ago, so the central area was not completely flooded, and the extent of the damage caused by the flooding was relatively light. We must see whether warehouse managers can quickly</p>
<p>Move goods from the lower floors. The damage to public buildings and properties cannot be estimated until the floodwaters have receded and the situation has returned to normal. The pumps installed by the Municipal Council on the Bund are working day and night, but with heavy rain and high tides coming together, this type of flood control plan is insufficient to cope with the situation. It is quite difficult to make the central area completely free of flooding.</p>

<h3 id="e51">Several Japanese Warships Sail to Weihaiwei; Coveting British Leased Territory; Lease of Liugong Island Has Been Approved for Extension; Rumor That the Japanese Side May Accept the Territory <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>According to the English-language Greater Shanghai Evening Post, according to visitors from North China, regarding the land and port of Weihaiwei that China leased to Britain, the Japanese side may accept it. Four days ago, they witnessed six Japanese destroyers, one cruiser, and one transport ship arriving at Weihaiwei. No telegrams have been received in Shanghai regarding this matter, indicating that the arrival of the Japanese warships at Weihaiwei and the events that followed may have been censored and the news was not allowed to be transmitted.</p>
<p>Chinese Government Allows Renewal of Lease</p>
<p>Liugong Island in Weihaiwei was leased to the British in the 24th year of the Guangxu reign (1898). It has been renewed several times since then. The most recent decision was in the 19th year of the Republic (1930), when the Chinese government agreed to renew the lease for ten years. However, Nanjing recently declared that it would not recognize this. On October 1, 1930, the Chinese government leased certain areas and buildings in Weihaiwei to the British government until October 1, 1940. However, the Chinese and British governments have recently agreed to renew the lease.</p>
<p>Naval Personnel Rest and Escape the Summer Heat</p>
<p>Currently, the land leased by the British government in Weihaiwei includes the residence of the senior district officer, the open space inside the residence, stables, two foreign cemeteries, the British Club, the international sports ground, and the golf course. These houses and areas are leased to the British as a "place for British naval personnel to rest and escape the summer heat." The Chinese government has promised to be responsible for repairing the municipal facilities in the area and has allowed the British to use the mooring area and dredge it. However, if China and Britain are at war, China will revoke these privileges and British ships must leave the area. The British also have the right to send troops to land and train in the area and to transport in any supplies they need, but they are not allowed to store military goods or heavy fire.</p>

<p>Goods Transported Through Vietnam Will Not Be Detained; The Ministry of Foreign Affairs Has An Accommodating Arrangement with the French Side. Since mid-June, when the Yin Dan Shi Lin cloth produced by the Lun Hua Factory of Shanghai Chinese Merchants and transported to the interior through Vietnam was detained by the customs there as it was considered to be a German trademark, the industry association immediately submitted a request to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, which in turn requested the French Consulate General in Shanghai to provide proof, and also submitted a request to the Ministry of Economic Affairs, requesting the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to make representations to the Vietnamese government to quickly release the detained cloth in order to maintain friendly relations between the two countries. It is heard that the industry association has recently received a reply telegram from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs forwarded by the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, stating that the Ministry has long ago reached an accommodating arrangement with the French side regarding German goods passing through Vietnam, regardless of whether they are state-owned or privately owned, and has notified all relevant agencies. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated in the telegram that the detention mentioned by the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce may be related to the suspension of transport in Vietnam this time, and should be transferred to the Haiphong Consulate General to verify and handle the details of the detention and the date of arrival of the cloth in Vietnam. It should be noted that the Ministry's telegram refers specifically to goods detained in Vietnam and seems to be a separate matter from the goods confiscated by Yunhua in Guangzhou Bay. However, according to reports, there are rumors that the Haiphong consulate is about to withdraw, and it is feared that the express telegram will not be able to catch up.</p>

<p>The labor dispute at the French-owned Water and Electricity Company, Tramway Company, and Motor Engine Room has lasted for several days, and labor and management have not yet begun formal negotiations as of yesterday. The company's general manager, Favre-Levrey, met with two labor representatives the day before, but failed to accept the workers' various demands, and no results were achieved. Yesterday, in order to quickly resolve the labor dispute, the labor side elected another representative and went to the Political Affairs Department of the French Police Station at 2:00 PM yesterday to request prompt mediation of the labor dispute to avoid escalating the situation. According to a statement from a labor representative yesterday, after the labor representatives went to the Political Affairs Department of the French Police Station yesterday to state the reasons for the strike and request a speedy mediation, they obtained steps for a patrol mediation, and labor and management will soon directly negotiate the methods for various works.</p>
<p>Tram Inspector Kidnapped Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>A kidnapping case suddenly occurred in the floodwaters of Avenue Joffre yesterday morning. No one discovered the whereabouts of the kidnappers at the time. It was not until the family of the kidnapped person reported to the police with information that the details were revealed. Around 1:00 AM yesterday, four men, each armed with a handgun, went to 232 Avenue Joffre, knocked on the back door, went straight to the second floor, and entered the residence of Lu He, a Ningbo native who is currently an inspector at the French-owned Tramway Company. After threatening him with guns, they dragged Lu from the bed and took him downstairs. When Lu's family went outside to investigate, there were no traces. So they reported to the police station and requested an investigation. The police station is currently investigating, but as of this moment, Lu's whereabouts are still unknown. However, based on general observations, Lu's kidnapping may be related to the labor dispute. Whether this is true or not, it will be recorded for confirmation.</p>

<p>According to the English-language "Ta Mei Evening Post," regarding the incident where American sailor Ponat, a first-class seaman on the American ship "Augusta," was beaten and humiliated by Japanese military police, the attitude of the Japanese authorities here is that "the matter is closed" after an "apology" from the American naval shore patrol officer. However, the U.S. Navy in Shanghai stated this morning (the 3rd) that the case has not been resolved. The U.S. Navy sent a note to the Japanese side on Monday and is currently awaiting their reply. According to a U.S. Navy officer who spoke to reporters this morning, the situation is the same as yesterday (the 2nd), with no changes. The U.S. authorities, after completing the investigation of the case, believe that there was no reason for the American side to apologize. The U.S. Navy shore patrol officer wrote a note on the spot, apologizing to the Japanese side at a time when the officer did not fully understand the truth of the case and acted voluntarily. At the same time, Japanese officials in this city said they believed the matter was closed and did not want minor quarrels to lead to unfortunate events.</p>
<p>U.S.-Japan Meeting - Not a Fact</p>
<p>Also, Tsurumi Ken, a spokesman for the Japanese Embassy, told Western reporters that the note from Admiral Hart, commander of the U.S. Navy's Asiatic Fleet, to Vice Admiral Shimada, commander of the Japanese Navy's Third Fleet, would be answered soon. He said that the Japanese authorities considered the case to be an unfortunate minor matter, not worthy of attention. A senior officer on the "Augusta" yesterday denied the rumor that a meeting of senior officials from the U.S. and Japan was held on the flagship. He said that only a newly appointed chief of staff of the Japanese military made a routine visit to Admiral Hart.</p>
<h3 id="e56">Those Requesting Exemption from Excess Profit Tax - Directly Rejected <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>The Executive Yuan issued a notice to chambers of commerce throughout the country to promote the excess profit tax. The imposition of excess profit tax in extraordinary times aims to regulate the abnormal national economy and balance the national burden during wartime. Based on the standard of progressive excess, to realize the principle of "those with money contribute money, those with strength contribute strength," it is indeed a good law with good intentions. Previously, considering the difficulties of merchants, the regulations were amended to postpone the start date by half a year, and the starting standard was also appropriately raised with reference to the statutory interest rate. At the time of implementation and assessment, the Ministry of Finance also formulated measures to provide leniency to small businesses and to relieve wartime losses, further reducing the direct and indirect burden on merchants and the people. Therefore, since the tax was first levied this year, merchants and producers in various places have successively complied and actively reported. However, a few merchants who lack a broad perspective still inevitably manipulate public opinion and request exemption in various ways. It is necessary to strengthen the widespread publicity and administrative sanctions in order to prevent cunning and achieve significant results. In addition to the Ministry of Finance compiling and printing publicity brochures, and separately ordering the responsible tax authorities in various places to step up investigation and collection, the provincial governments should instruct the county governments to fully assist in the tax collection work. If there are cases where merchants submit requests for postponement or exemption, they should be directly rejected to maintain the integrity of tax administration and facilitate implementation. In addition to issuing orders to the provincial and municipal governments, you are hereby ordered to comply accordingly. This order.</p>

<p>The "Ping Bao" newspaper office (formerly the "Wen Hui Bao" site) at 436 Fuzhou Road in the International Settlement was attacked last night at 10:45 PM. A white-牌 car traveling east to west in front of the newspaper office slowed down slightly. Suddenly, a passenger in the car threw a grenade from the car window towards the "Ping Bao" newspaper office. The grenade hit the wire mesh installed outside the second-floor loft of the newspaper office and exploded on the spot.</p>
<p>The sound of the explosion was loud and deafening, and thick smoke filled the air. Fragments of the grenade flew everywhere. One large pane of glass in front of the newspaper office and more than a dozen pieces of Berlin windows and doors on the second-floor balcony were shattered. The wire mesh outside the window was also blown into a hole. At that time, the explosion injured</p>
<p>The newspaper's workers</p>
<p>and five guards, and three passersby. After throwing the bomb, the perpetrator continued to drive the original car west through 浙江路 and north via 建设路. After the incident, the police received a report and sent a large number of Chinese and Western detectives in patrol cars to investigate. Seeing that the bomber had already left, they urgently</p>
<p>summoned an ambulance</p>
<p>to take the eight injured people to Renji Hospital for treatment. They also placed guards in the vicinity and conducted a thorough search, but found nothing. The names of the injured are as follows: Xu Zhongwei, a Chinese police officer (No. 2672) from the Laozha station (30 years old, from Jiangsu), injured his left leg; the newspaper's</p>
<p>guard policeman</p>
<p>Yang Zhengliang (47 years old, from Ningbo), injured his left hand and left leg; Lu Dongliang (28 years old, from Shanghai) injured his left brain and left leg.

<p>Since the price of tap water, along with other public utilities, has repeatedly increased, property owners have used this as an excuse to raise rents, and second landlords pass it on to third tenants, so the public burden is extremely heavy. Citizens from all walks of life hope that the authorities will reduce water prices at an appropriate time to alleviate the burden. According to a public notice issued by the Bureau of Public Works on the 2nd of this month, in May of this year, the Bureau approved the Shanghai Waterworks Company to increase the 50% surcharge on water prices to 110% for the period ending June 17th of this year or after that date, and asked the company to send personnel to jointly negotiate with representatives of the Bureau on how to reduce the burden on users in terms of preparing the maximum amount of British gold dividends in accordance with the franchise operating contract. The company accepted the Bureau's invitation and held several meetings with the Bureau. As a result, although the company had not paid the maximum amount of British gold dividends in accordance with the franchise operating contract in the previous two years, it was not prepared to allow any changes to the relevant clauses of the contract, whether temporary or not, in order to avoid future constraints. The company has now promised not to increase the current surcharge of 110% within the year.</p>

<p>Vietnamese Rice Shipped to Shanghai</p>
<p>The soaring rice prices in the city have greatly affected the lives of ordinary people. Although subsidized rice sales have recently been organized, those between the middle and upper classes cannot benefit because it is not easy to buy subsidized rice. Since the Japanese army landed in Haiphong, the Shanghai-Vietnam shipping route has been interrupted, and rice dealers and hoarders have taken the opportunity to be active, disregarding the people's food, using pretexts to raise prices, and spreading rumors that imported rice cannot come to Shanghai. However, in the week since the Japanese army landed in Haiphong, the imported rice directly and indirectly shipped has continued to arrive.</p>
<p>Arriving Daily</p>
<p>It is estimated that Jardine Matheson's "Mingsheng"轮 directly loaded more than 11,200 bags from Haiphong, and another 7,000 bags were shipped from Hong Kong, arriving in Shanghai on the 30th of last month and having been unloaded completely. The same company's "Lisheng" 轮 also shipped more than 1,400 bags from Hong Kong, which have been unloaded. Yesterday it went to Qingdao. Swire Company's "Suiyang" 轮 loaded more than 6,400 bags from Hong Kong, arriving on the 2nd of this month and unloading at the Huatong warehouse in Pudong. Yesterday, Jardine Matheson's "Taisheng" 轮 also loaded more than 6,500 bags from Hong Kong and docked at the Roosevelt Wharf for unloading. It is now known that the source of imported rice is uninterrupted. Even if Vietnam cannot directly ship it, it is said that there is a large batch of rice in Hong Kong waiting to be shipped to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Yesterday's Transaction Volume</p>
<p>Yesterday, Shenji 洋行 sold 4,000 tons of No. 2 Tribute Rice, and 合中洋行 sold 1,000 tons, totaling 5,000 tons (i.e., 50,000 bags). The transaction price was 79.6 yuan (per bag of one stone and two dou and a half). The imported rice will be shipped to Shanghai by French mail tomorrow. As for the source of domestic rice, it has recently decreased slightly, but more than 1,000 bags still arrive daily, and there is no danger of interruption. General merchants are actively purchasing, waiting for the opportunity to transport it to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Distributing Inexpensive Meals</p>
<p>The Shanghai Zhongjiao Daoyi Association is enthusiastic about charity. Recently, due to the soaring rice prices and the increasingly difficult lives of ordinary people, it has been decided to establish a Daoyi Inexpensive Meal Center at No. 1, Lane 121, Tongfu Road, starting from October 5th, to sell inexpensive meals. The daily limit is 1,000 catties, and each person is limited to 2 catties at 1 jiao per catty. The time is from 9:00 AM to 11:00 AM every day.</p>

<p>The Yindu Dance Palace at 988 Fuxu Road is the first dance hall in the Far East in the style of 1941. Preparations have been underway for half a year and it is now heard that it may open in about half a month.</p>
<p>The Yindu Dance Palace was jointly funded by Fu Huaichen, a well-known figure in Shanghai, and Yang Dechuan, general manager of the Jincheng Western Restaurant. The capital is more than 200,000 yuan, and its nature is entirely to regulate the high-end entertainment of people in Shanghai, and it is not solely focused on profit. Therefore, all facilities can be called the first in the Far East. It is heard that the decoration part alone cost 150,000 gold. The entire project was designed by the famous architect Bao Huai and built by the Xulun Construction Company. Everything from the piano stage, lamps, seats, and sofas are in the style of 1941. What is even more elaborate is that the surrounding walls are made of French silk velvet, which alone cost more than 20,000 gold. It can be described as magnificent and luxurious, which cannot be described by the reporter's casual praise. It is heard that the orchestra was hired from the Philippines at a cost of 10,000 yuan, and the leader is the Addy dance girl. In addition to hiring the most popular dance stars from the major dance halls in the city, special personnel were sent to Hong Kong to hire the queens of various dance publications and invite the socialites of Shanghai and Hong Kong to help dance. In short, everything can surpass the city's dance halls. It is now heard that the important internal personnel have been appointed: Fu Huaichen as chairman, Yang Dechuan as manager, Wang Baosheng as dance hall director, and Chen Guoliang, Chen Defang, and Zhang Gongfu as dance girl foremen. With so many talented people, it will definitely take the lead in the city's dance industry after the opening, which can be predicted.</p>

<p>Li Yuying, a nurse from Fujian province and head nurse at the Zhongxi Sanatorium on Pushi Road, also known as Jieru, suddenly died suddenly in the hospital on the night of June 10, causing a lot of disputes. The hospital's business manager Lu Zhenqing and doctor Lin Zhengliang were prosecuted by the prosecutor for forging evidence. After the initial trial resulted in acquittal, social opinion was rampant. The prosecutor has now filed an appeal to the High Third Branch. The Second Special Court has already</p>
<p>transferred the case file to the High Court for review and instructions. A hearing will be held soon. Lu Zhenqing also withheld 8,700 yuan in cash and gold jewelry and clothing left by Li Yuying, worth about 20,000 yuan, and refused to return them to the deceased's parents. Li Shizhen, the father of the deceased, also filed a lawsuit against him in the civil court of the Second Special Court, and accountants are currently auditing the accounts. Recently, Tao Yangwu, the manager of the China Funeral Home, commissioned a lawyer to file a lawsuit in the civil court of the Second Special Court against Li Shizhen, the father of the deceased, to pay for the funeral expenses of Li Yuying, totaling more than 2,000 yuan. The defendant commissioned three lawyers, Wu Zhiping, Wang Hengyi, and Li Zhongdao, to act as agents. The case was</p>
<p>heard once by Judge Tan Hao, who ordered the witnesses to be summoned for further questioning. All the details have been recorded in this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon, the court held another hearing. The witness Lu Zhenqing himself did not appear and commissioned someone to act as an agent. The court ruled that the witness could not be commissioned to act as an agent, so the letter of commission was rejected and he was not summoned. Then, witness He Shuyu testified, 33 years old, from Fujian, residing at No. 860 Xujiahui Road, and previously worked with Li Yuying at the Zhongxi Sanatorium until leaving on July 19. After Li died, Lu Zhenqing called me to go and see the deceased. Because I was very friendly before, I was very sad to see her body. Lu had already notified the funeral home to send a car to take the body away. I went to the funeral home and saw Lu signing the name of the person in charge on the power of attorney. The chief mourner was the father of the deceased, Li Shizhen. At that time, I advised Lu, Li's</p>
<p>parents are very poor and the whole family relies on Li for support. Now that the person is dead, we should take care of the living and not make the clothes and coffin of the deceased too good. Lu replied that Li Yuying had made great contributions to the sanatorium and that he was willing to handle the best clothes and coffin to thank the deceased for her contributions during her lifetime. He would be responsible for all funeral expenses. Witness Gan Chuanwen also testified that he worked with the deceased. After Li died, I left the sanatorium on July 11. At that time, Lu asked me to help handle the funeral and asked me to buy funeral clothes. Lu was responsible for all the procedures at the funeral home. After the funeral, the funeral home sent someone</p>
<p>to collect the bill, and Lu asked me to issue a 2,000 yuan check. It was heard that Lu had already paid for Li's funeral expenses. The day after Li's death, Lu asked me to comfort Li's parents and asked me to convey that Lu would be responsible for providing living expenses in the future. There are also Wu Xianliang, Zhou Xinyi, Yan Xianhong and other three people who are currently working in the sanatorium and can be summoned for questioning. The rest of the testimony is the same as what He testified. At this point, the court adjourned the hearing to the 21st to summon Lu Zhenqing and Wu, Zhou, Yan and other witnesses to the court for further questioning.</p>

<p>Chen and Sun, two employees of the Beijing Road Jiangxi Road Zhejiang Industrial Bank's revenue and expenditure business unit and trust department, were suddenly arrested by the Japanese side and the police at the bank on the 13th of last month. They were first detained at the Central Police Station. Because the Japanese side repeatedly requested the police authorities to extradite them, they were sent to Hongkou on the 25th of last month. It has been nearly ten days. According to a reporter from the Huawen News Agency, Chen and Sun were sent back to the Central Police Station by the Hongkou side yesterday (the 3rd). It is now known that the police have completed most of the investigation of this case and will release them soon. After investigation, the reporter found that Chen and Sun were young and newly promoted from trainees to formal employees. They were usually law-abiding and did not participate in external affairs. In addition to handling bank affairs, they never participated in any political activities. It is said that the reason for their arrest was due to a misunderstanding.</p>

<h3 id="e73">Famous Painter Zhang Shanzi Returns to Hong Kong from America, His Overseas Promotion Well-Received in America and France, Returns Home with Honorary Doctorate <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>(Hong Kong Dispatch) The famous Chinese painter Zhang Shanzi, renowned in the art world as "Tiger Addict," was dispatched along with Bishop Yu Bin in the winter of the 27th year to promote abroad. He also brought with him several large paintings, including "Ode to Uprightness" and "Loyalty, Filial Piety, and Righteousness," for exhibitions and fundraising. He gained much praise from friendly nations and was welcomed by overseas Chinese communities everywhere. His accomplishments were very satisfactory. He left America at the end of August to return to China and arrived in Hong Kong on the morning of September 25th. Minister Wu's representative Zheng Bingzhong and his close friends Lei Zhusheng, Jian Qinqi, Lu Danlin, and others went to the pier to welcome him. He is staying at Jian Qinqi's studio in the Wan King Building in Causeway Bay. He plans to rest for a few days before going to Chongqing to report back. The following is an account of Mr. Zhang's interview with reporters about his experiences on this trip.</p>
<p>First Stop, Paris: Mr. Zhang left Kunming via Vietnam in December of the 27th year. Initially, at the start of the August 13th Incident and the War of Resistance, to inspire the people's spirit, he chose Wen Tianxiang's "Ode to Uprightness" and created fourteen paintings, which were greatly praised by the authorities. Chairman Lin and Chairman Chiang both personally inscribed words. They were exhibited in Wuhan, Chongqing, and other places, and viewers praised them endlessly. Later, he created four paintings on "Loyalty, Filial Piety, and Righteousness," and Chairman Lin inscribed the words "Profoundly Meaningful." In November of that year, the Political Participation Council decided to send Bishop Yu Bin abroad for fundraising and simultaneously appointed Mr. Zhang in the name of a member of the Central Relief Committee to accompany him for promotion. They first went to Europe, arriving in Paris, the capital of France. The French government admired his art and specially allowed the National Museum to be used as the venue for his exhibition. French President Lebrun even personally visited. A private exhibition being held at the museum was a first, demonstrating the French authorities' high regard for his art. Later, because he needed to rush to America to participate in the World Expo, he was unable to go to England, Belgium, and other countries.</p>
<p>Experiences in America</p>
<p>He traveled from Europe to America, only to learn that the government would not participate in the World Expo. Therefore, he held separate exhibitions in New York, Chicago, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Boston, and other places. He received support from enthusiastic local overseas Chinese and friendly people, and the results were excellent. At the same time, he sold paintings to raise funds, and the income was directly remitted to Chongqing by local people. The travel expenses paid to him by schools and organizations for lectures were also remitted to the government as relief funds. Mrs. Roosevelt, the President of the United States, heard of his great reputation and invited him to the White House several times, treating him as an honored guest. Fu Jen Catholic University in America was founded by Catholics. They deeply admired his spirit of enthusiastic relief work and highly praised his artistic achievements. They specially awarded him a Doctorate of Law degree, and a grand awarding ceremony was held on June 12th of this year. Mr. Zhang believes that this honor is an unexpected harvest from this trip.</p>
<p>Selection of Works</p>
<p>In addition to the aforementioned "Ode to Uprightness" and other paintings, Mr. Zhang also brought to the exhibition works such as the large paintings "Roar, China!" and "A Herd of Tigers," the largest of which were over twenty feet long, truly masterpieces. In addition, there were landscapes, figures, flowers, and birds, all of which were present, making it a grand collection of paintings. All the works were photographed, and those who competed to buy them for fundraising were enthusiastic. On the ship back to China, Mr. Zhang also exhibited his works, inviting passengers and crew members to visit, which was well received. While abroad, Mr. Zhang still wore a traditional Chinese gown and cloth shoes, fully representing the simple and resolute national spirit of the Chinese people, leaving a deep impression on Europeans and Americans.</p>
<p>Exhibition in Hong Kong</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang returned to Hong Kong from America on September 25th, and all his works were brought with him. Initially, due to the suddenness of the trip, he was unwilling to hold an exhibition in Hong Kong. Recently, his friends Xu Shiying, Wu Tiecheng, Ye Gongchuo, Du Yong, Wang Xiaolai, Xu Dishan, Hu Zhengzhi, Jian Youwen, Yang Tianji, Jian Jinglun, and others launched a proposal, requesting Mr. Zhang to hold a short-term exhibition for the appreciation of the people of Hong Kong. Although Mr. Zhang felt that he could not refuse out of politeness, he ultimately only agreed to a non-public exhibition due to the short time he would be staying in Hong Kong. He will display his works for half a day, inviting celebrities and cultural figures from Hong Kong and abroad to visit. The works will generally not be for sale, and there will be no admission tickets. The invitations will be distributed by Mr. Xu and others, and Lu Danlin, Ma Guoliang, Ye Qianyu, Zhang Zhengyu, Lei Zhusheng, Jian Erming, Yang Ji, and others will be responsible for all arrangements. Those who love Mr. Zhang's art can truly feast their eyes during the exhibition period.</p>

<p>The Chinese and Western schools under the Public Works Department were closed for two days due to the heavy rain yesterday and the day before.

<h3 id="e75">British Female Physiologist Dr. Goris Gives a Lecture, Citing the Issue of Muscle Training and Workers' Rest <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>On Monday evening of this week, Dr. Litt, the Army Chief of the Lester Institute of Medical Research, hosted a banquet at the Overseas Chinese Youth Association of the Eight Immortals for members of the Public Health Society and invited Dr. Goris, a famous British female physiologist, to give a lecture on the issue of "Industrial Labor." Dr. Goris first explained how Britain tried to replenish its arms shortage during the European War from 1914 to 1918. She said that at the time, workers were willing to extend their working hours and abolish Sunday breaks, but the result was a decline in arms production, which was surprising. Later, the policy was changed, limiting daily working hours to six and stipulating that there should be one day of rest in seven days. As a result, production increased greatly. Dr. Goris continued that the workers employed by the famous British engineering firm Messon Platt worked ten hours a day, from 6 a.m. to 5 p.m. After adopting an eight-hour work system and trying it out for two years, during the trial period, workers' wages were not reduced. The results were very effective, and the increase in output was enough to offset the increase in wages. Dr. Goris then cited muscle training, saying that if people train their muscles for too long, they will become tired, and the time needed for rest will often be longer than the time for training. If the exertion is temporary and the rest is long, then the training program can be carried out indefinitely. Therefore, the saying that workers should have rest is based on this principle.</p>

<p>The third game of the Charity Basketball Challenge, Paramount vs. Guoguang Alumni, continued last night at the Chinese Youth Gymnasium. The excitement and tension of the game were completely unexpected, and the audience was satisfied. In the thrilling game, Paramount won by only one point, 24 to 23, with the first half being 15 to 10. Ticket prices were doubled last night, but the audience was still very enthusiastic, with a full house of about six or seven hundred people. The order was very good, and the booing was completely gone, which is a welcome phenomenon. It is said that the fourth game will be held next Tuesday night, with Liangxi playing.</p>
<p>Wang Jinghu Buys the Ball for 500 Yuan</p>
<p>During the halftime break, the ball was auctioned off as usual. Yuan Ludeng, the chairman of the Nanyang College, was unable to attend in person due to mediating the labor dispute between the French Concession Tramway, so Pan Hongding, the general secretary of the college, acted on his behalf. Doing good is the greatest joy, and people scrambled to bid. After the opening price of 100 yuan, Yao Jia Gui, Zhu Daxun, and other gentlemen successively bid 300 yuan and 400 yuan, and finally, Wang Jinghu, the general manager of the Jue Dance Hall in the city, donated 500 yuan to buy it. His enthusiasm is admirable.</p>
<p>Guoguang's Performance Unexpectedly Beautiful</p>
<p>Although the Guoguang Alumni team was hastily assembled last night, they were particularly careful in their battle against a strong enemy. They completely changed their strategy, using slow attacks to blunt the edge of Paramount and not throwing easily to reduce the opponent's chances of getting the ball. They changed their defense to a five-man zone defense, which hindered Paramount's attack. As a result, Paramount had fewer chances to get the ball and found it difficult to attack, creating an unexpectedly tense situation.</p>
<p>Paramount Fights Hard to Come from Behind</p>
<p>At 8:15, the fierce battle began with the whistle of referee Qu Honglu. For three minutes, both sides were scoreless. Before long, Fan Qingxian was fouled by Li Zhenzhong, and he hit the bullseye. Guoguang opened the scoring. Paramount counterattacked, Li Zhenzhong scored two points, and Paramount came from behind. Although the Guoguang heroes were gathered together on short notice, they were still sharp and collaborated as usual. Li Zude shot, Qiu Xiaoci made a tip in, and Zhang Shaoqing committed a foul. Fan Qingxian added a free throw. Guoguang's side suddenly increased by five points, and the score became six to two, with Guoguang gaining the advantage. However, Paramount remained calm and responded calmly. Finally, Feng Nianhua turned around and shot, breaking the decline. After eight to four, Paramount gradually gained the upper hand. Li Zhenzhong made a wonderful shot, and Chang Lu replaced Wang Jinghu, showing his power and bringing the score to an equal eight to eight. After that, Nianhua made two shots, and Shaoqing Xianglong made one free throw and one shot, increasing the score by eleven points in one go. Guoguang only made one shot by Chen Bangzhen, ten to fifteen, ending the first half with Paramount coming from behind.</p>
<p>A Precious Point Decides the Victory</p>
<p>After the auction, the war drums were sounded again. Li Zude first probed the basket, Feng Nianhua scored a free throw, and Li Zude came again with a free throw. The score became closer and closer, thirteen to sixteen, only three points apart. Unexpectedly, Paramount's surprise soldier stood out. Yu Dehai both shot and made a free throw, increasing the score by three points. At that time, Bao Songyuan, who was originally the mainstay of Guoguang and is now a member of Paramount, was generously lent to the game by the Paramount authorities to increase the interest of the competition, replacing Fan Qingxian. After adding a shot, Qiu Xiaoci scored another three points, and the score suddenly became eighteen to nineteen, only one point apart. The atmosphere in the stadium became more and more intense. Paramount's five tigers attacked more urgently. Yu Dehai, Zhang Shaoqing, and Feng Nianhua made great contributions, increasing the score from the close score of nineteen to eighteen to twenty-four to eighteen. At that time, there were less than four minutes left until the end of the game. As the Guoguang team fought back, Qiu Xiaoci accidentally fell and injured his abdomen and left the field. Fan Qingxian was transferred in, but ultimately lost his energy. When Fan Qingxian made a long shot to twenty-three to twenty-four, Li Zude had a free throw opportunity but missed it, which was a pity. Before long, the end of the game sounded, and Paramount won with an advantage of one point, twenty-four to twenty-three.</p>

<p>The Yinyin Cup table tennis tournament took place last night between Jin Cheng and Zhonghui at the Yinyin Friendship Association's ball room. According to Mr. Wang Zhongfu, the general manager of the Jin Cheng team, he had called Zhonghui in the afternoon to inquire about their attendance, as the roads were blocked by rainwater, and the game could be postponed. However, Zhonghui did not reply. Jin Cheng arrived at the Yinlian Association on time to play, but Zhonghui's team had not arrived by the appointed time. According to the rules, they were considered to have forfeited the game, and Jin Cheng won without effort. There will be three games tonight, Shanghai vs. HSBC, which are evenly matched and will be a fierce battle. The order for tonight is recorded as follows.</p>

<p>According to Chen Linsheng, a member of the preparation committee for the charity table tennis tournament, table tennis is divided into singles and doubles, like tennis. However, the rules are slightly different, so table tennis is also called table tennis. For more than ten years, singles table tennis has been popular, but no one practices the doubles game. There are two reasons for its unpopularity: one is the limitation of the venue, as doubles requires a wider ballroom to allow players to show their skills, and the other is the difficulty of finding suitable partners. Nanyang College is hosting a charity table tennis tournament to raise funds. To make the event exciting, they have specially created an unprecedented and great team women's doubles competition. It is hoped that all sectors of society will promote it in the future. The charity tournament will be held around the 20th of this month at the Lido Ballroom.</p>

<h3 id="e79">Grain, Rice Prices Slightly Decline After Being Too High, Japonica Rice Prices Still Hold Firm and Are Not Easily Loosened <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the rice market suddenly turned bearish, because after several days of sharp rises, those who had profited took advantage of the high prices to sell, and the sound of selling was everywhere. In addition, the floodwaters inundated many warehouses in low-lying areas, and people hurriedly tried to sell them off, resulting in mutual competition to sell, and the decline was more intense. In the blink of an eye in the early market, the prices of various foreign rice varieties had fallen by about one yuan. Afterwards, continuous selling continued, and the decline became more and more acute. It was then heard that Shenji Foreign Company had ordered 2,000 tons (rumored to be 4,000 tons, but it is said that there were not enough orders to secure half of them, and another said that another 2,000 tons were ordered by a certain celebrity on credit), and Hezhong Foreign Company had ordered 1,000 tons, and there were many other unconfirmed orders. As a result, the market's sentiment became more downward-looking. Yinghua Company's original bags were bought back in the early market for 81.2 yuan, then from 80 yuan to 79.56 yuan, and in the afternoon it fell to as low as 79.34 yuan, with a total volume of 3-400 tons. Compared to the early market, the spot foreign rice was small, and the afternoon market fell by 1.5 yuan, and then another half yuan, for a total decline of about two yuan. The transaction volume was less than 4,000 bags. Except for No. 1 Saigon, which was still priced at 75 yuan due to scarce inventory, the rest, such as No. 2 Saigon, were only 68.5 to 68 yuan, No. 2 Siam was 66 to 67 yuan, small jiao was 65 to 66 yuan, and rice tea was 58 to 59 yuan.</p>
<p>Although the movement of glutinous rice was also flat, it usually lacks volatility. In this tired market, it was able to stand firm like an autumn chrysanthemum defying frost. Jinli special grade was still 74 yuan, Changdan goods were 72 to 73 yuan, Hong Kong special grade was 72 to 73 yuan, and the lower grade was 70 yuan. Nuolü was high from 65 to 66 yuan, and the lower grade was 63 to 64 yuan.</p>
<p>Thick and thin broken japonica rice was originally the only popular product on the market, so it was able to maintain its original price, similar to the previous one. Although the source of new japonica tips from bicycles was cut off, there were still 5-600 shi of river cargo being transported, and the weather turned sunny, so the quality was more durable, so the sales market stagnated and the price was difficult to support, following the decline of foreign rice by 1-2 yuan. Zhuanqiao new japonica was 86 to 87 yuan, Taicang sheep tip was 72.5 yuan and 72 yuan, Qingjiao Du tip was 76 to 77 yuan, and Beigang fragrant japonica was a fresh and wonderful product, and because of the scarcity of goods, it was priced at 94 yuan.</p>
<p>Foreign rice continued to arrive, and yesterday Heyang Company's Taisheng Wheel arrived in Shanghai, carrying 6,501 bags from Hong Kong, docking at Roosevelt Wharf for unloading.</p>
<h3 id="e80">Flour is Supported by Australian Flour, Wheat is All Bought by Japanese Merchants <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>The flour market was not exciting yesterday. The market's sentiment was that there were repeated orders for foreign flour, and more than 500,000 bags of Australian flour were ordered one after another, and large shipments would soon be transported to Shanghai. The market was ultimately affected, so the price of returned old truck warehouse orders was still 17.5 yuan, and it was difficult to rise or fall. Now foreign flour is in demand because the current inventory is insufficient, and it still costs 18.23 yuan. It is heard that yesterday Luyu Weng and other brands, the Nanyang gang added 4-5,000 bags, priced at 18.5 yuan, and the factory price was 16.5 yuan. In addition to supplying the daily needs of this street, there were no large-scale sales. Today, 5,000 bags of flour will be shipped to Xiamen.</p>
<p>Wheat was as calm as usual yesterday. Vehicle and ship sources occasionally exist, all designated for delivery to Japanese factories, and the selling price is still 21 yuan. On the Chinese factory side, it is difficult to import into the concession, and there are almost no formal transactions. Domestic sales are also sluggish due to lack of supply. However, it is heard that 100 bags of wheat were opened in Taicang, priced at 25 yuan.

<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market situation, HSBC's listing price, did not fluctuate. The dark market for British and American exchange rates was loose first and then tight, and the trend was unstable. Speculators seized the opportunity to turn around, because it was rumored that the American policy was still hesitant. This statement was considered a positive, and because there were very few sellers, the market felt an imbalance between supply and demand. However, American banks and others entered British and exited American, with a combined exchange rate of 3 yuan and 7.8 cents, so the initial results were settled. The spot price was 3 shillings 15/625. Only the American exchange rate was tight, and the spot and futures prices were both flattened, with the price being 5.5 yuan, which was softer by 0.031.</p>
<p>Speculators Close Forward American Exchange Rate</p>

After the opening, speculators sold, and the market hardened. A certain American bank and a foreign bank absorbed American exchange rates of 5 yuan 5625 to 59375 for the current month from Chinese merchant speculators. HSBC's listing price was announced without change, and the white silver balance tax was announced to remain unchanged. After this, a slightly positive air was transmitted, so speculators stopped blocking and instead bought forward American exchange rates for the distant month, counting the beneficial purchase of November American exchange rates at 5.5 yuan from British banks. The potential weakening has already been seen, but the transaction is not very strong. Afterwards, it was still relatively stable. Japanese Bank Mitsui sold the current month's American exchange rate to foreign banks for 5 yuan 53125.

Again, because the needs of Hong Kong Electric and others were quite strong, the market was tight, counting the input of the current month's American exchange rate at 5.5 yuan from Hong Kong Electric to foreign banks. The closing price for American exchange rates, both spot and futures, was 5.5 yuan. The spot price for British gold and this month's price were 3 shillings 51/5625, and the price for next month was 3 shillings and a half, with no honor or disgrace compared to the previous day's British gold. The spot price for American exchange rates was reduced by 0.03125, and the forward price was settled.</p>

<p>Yesterday's spot gold dark market fluctuated all day, hovering around 5,850 yuan. The weakest state was at the morning opening, due to the hardening of foreign exchange.

As a result, the closing price was 5,883 yuan, an increase of 28 yuan compared to the previous day. The transaction volume for the whole day was more than 3,000 taels. Silver shop jewelry gold ultimately did not change, and customs gold and other gold remained flat.</p>
<p>Spot Gold Slightly Increases by 28 Yuan</p>
<p>In the early morning, due to the loosening of the exchange market, retail investors came to sell. The silver shops first made a pair of ten taels, for 5,820 yuan, as the opening price, a decrease of 35 yuan compared to the previous day. Before long, the gold shop money changers took advantage of the low price to absorb, and the price rebounded. The securities gang sold 20 taels to the silver shop, for 5,860 yuan. But soon another money changer entered the market seeking to sell, and the silver shop also sold, so it was frustrated again. The gold shop sold 30 taels to the silver shop, for 5,830 yuan. Later, because foreign exchange softened, retail investors were aroused to search and buy, and the gold shop continued to eat in, and in an instant it jumped dozens of yuan. The gold shop entered 20 taels to the money changer, rising to 5,870 yuan. Ultimately, the silver shop forcefully sold, and its momentum was difficult to block, and it was immediately suppressed.

It was heard that the exchange market was still softening, and the gold shop set up a securities gang to make rapid progress, and the price rose. The securities gang entered 30 taels to the gold shop, for 5,885 yuan. However, a certain silver shop short came out, causing a slight decline. The gold shop suppressed 20 taels to the silver shop, for 5,860 yuan. Fortunately, the securities gang and silver shop suddenly turned from selling to buying, pulling up dozens of yuan, and the silver shop paired 20 taels, for 5,885 yuan. As a result, the gold shop sold 10 taels to the silver shop, for 5,883 yuan, as the late closing price, an increase of 28 yuan compared to the previous day.

<p>Yesterday, the oil market opened in the morning with no particularly exciting activity from any party. The market saw slight fluctuations. Soon after, a bullish sentiment grew strong, and people were enthusiastic. The market then rose, with spot prices increasing by two dollars. Futures raw oil suddenly surpassed three dollars. In summary, inland cart workshops were forced to shut down, so they completely rely on supplies from this port. However, there are no large amounts of transportation permits available, so although there is no shocking price surge, its foundation is unusually firm, leading to rampant speculation that is difficult to control. Yesterday, 100 units of Jiaozhou soybean oil were traded at $81, 100 units of Yinqi soybean oil were traded at $82, and 1,200 dan of Dayouyu Factory soybean oil were traded at $90.05 to $91.50.

<p>The securities gray market saw even more prosperity yesterday, with the upward trend becoming more and more intense, soaring upwards. With four mid-sized banks buying heavily, Class C bonds approached the $60 mark, and new high prices were seen again for various market types. Regarding news, because Britain intends to aid China militarily and economically as an ally, and there are rumors of a 100 million dollar loan from the US to China, the excitement of the people, the firmness of the market, and the atmosphere of the market are full of bullish sentiment. Although the bears are still charging forward one after another, thinking that the market price is already extremely high, they do not know that in this extraordinary period, various abnormal developments have not ceased. How can public bonds be an exception? Moreover, they are still very cheap compared to any item at present. The future is unpredictable. Yesterday morning, Number 6 first bought in, followed by Zhongfu, Xinhua, and Guoxiang. Juxu, Xinfu, and Defu also bravely absorbed large quantities. Although Lianhe, Lianyi, and Hongda supplied large amounts, it was still not enough. At midday closing, prices suddenly rose by several cents to over one dollar. After the opening in the afternoon, the situation became even more tense. Class C bonds reached $59.35, and new high prices for various public bonds emerged one after another. Those gathered were all excited. Number 6, Zhongfu, Xinfu, and others were adding to their positions. Yongkang and Jiufu were also buying in. Lianhe also made up for a lot.

<p>Yesterday, the stock market for various industries saw little change, and transactions were also sparse. Judging from the dynamics of the market situation, the floating long volume this week seems to be slightly more than the short selling volume, but news easily influences the rise and fall of prices, regardless of which side is stronger or weaker.</p>
<p>London, 2nd (Wednesday) Dispatch: Today, the listed market prices of Chinese foreign debt and Far East British companies' stocks are all flat, and the market has no glory or disgrace.</p>

<p>The yarn market has turned upwards, but the situation is becoming more and more volatile. This is because the actual demand is mediocre. Hong Kong merchants are still constantly purchasing 10-count coarse yarn. People are optimistic, but the exchange rate continues to weaken, and gold is also flat, which is beneficial to the bears. However, the public's psychology is bullish. But when the price is high, sellers come along accordingly. Conversely, buyers are also active. So, for the time being, it is still in a state of hesitation.</p>
<p>At the opening of the spot yarn market this morning, morale was low because the closing situation on the previous day had softened. Some people took the opportunity to put pressure on the market. The opening price for 20-count Bianma yarn was $1,085, down $10 from the previous day. As soon as this market opened, general scalpers greatly absorbed it, and the market price gradually returned to $1,095 to $100. It hovered for a long time. Around 11 o'clock, rumors spread that the market price of a certain exchange had risen, and people were in an uproar, rising to over $1,100, to $1,110. The closing price was $1,108.

<p>Spot cotton trading has shown slight development because the yarn market has recovered, and the source of new cotton for the month has been blocked. Therefore, factories have a slight intention to purchase.</p>
<p>Baoshan Cotton $168.00, Japanese Factory Bought 1,000 Bales</p>
<p>American Cotton $243.00, Shenxin Bought 100 Pieces</p>

<p>The foreign cotton trade in Shanghai has been particularly active in recent days, especially for long-staple cotton for spot delivery. Yesterday, various Chinese and Japanese factories were well aware of the difficulty of transporting raw cotton to Shanghai, and the selling price in Shanghai was lower than the cargo on the ship. Therefore, various parties competed to buy yesterday, so the selling price was extraordinarily firm. Yesterday, the transaction volume was three to four thousand bales.</p>

Merchants from Nanlu Quagang bought more than 400 pieces of colored cloth and colored twill. Merchants from Yantai, Weihaiwei, and Qinhuangdao on this road bought 300 pieces of heavy coarse cloth and corduroy colored cloth. However, the wholesale of combined pieces by inland merchants from Shanghai-Ningbo and Shanghai-Hangzhou was less frequent due to transportation obstacles.</p>
<p>Eastern Cloth: Because of the increasing demand from the Northern and Yangtze River merchants, and the reduction in inventory, the market is tight. The price of mid-range goods is increasing even faster. Yesterday, the leading Longtou fine cloth rose by three and a half cents per piece, with a closing price of $34.55 per piece. The mid-range fine cloth rose by eight to nine cents per piece. Fine twill rose by five cents. Considering the cost, fine twill is still cheap, so there were five to six hundred pieces of dyeing transactions on this street.

Britain and Italy have no spot goods to ship, and those who inquire in the market are all asking for American goods. British and Italian goods seem to have disappeared. Therefore, the standard market price can only be recorded for American goods. However, in the past week, the situation in the Pacific has changed rapidly, which has also hit the source of American goods, and it is rare for traders to order overseas. As a result, the quoted price continues to rise. Yesterday, 90 pounds were sold for $120, 100 pounds were sold for $130, 90 pounds double-linked were sold for $230, and 100 pounds double-speed were shouted at $260.

<h3 id="e97">China's Silk Industry After the War <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>— Shi Xiang</p>
<p>This Year's Encounters</p>
<p>Since the small silk factories have made profits since last year, most of them have expanded their scope and improved their production this year. According to statistics, there are more than 370 small workshops in Wuxi alone, with a total of 9,700 machines. The production volume is also amazing. Unfortunately, this year, due to the huge cost of cocoons, the raw materials received by the factories are not enough for two months of work. At present, 80% of them have stopped work, and only a few are maintaining work.</p>
<p>Before the spring cocoons entered the market this year, the factories were very enthusiastic. Who would have expected that operating during the spring season would be counterproductive? The fact was unexpected. Most of them lost tens of thousands, which is considered fortunate, while a few factories lost almost everything. The reasons are nothing more than three points.</p>
<p>Huge Cost of Cocoons</p>
<p>Before the spring season started this year, the industry had discussions to assess the price of cocoons. At that time, according to the silk price of Shanghai foreign firms, the price of each dan of fresh cocoons was converted to $250, and the maximum should not exceed $300. This was unanimously passed. If the goods are received at the above price, the loss will not be as large as it is now. However, those who run small silk factories are mostly a mixed group, and they have no considerable experience in silk cocoons, and they have no definite calculation of the cost. They only rely on the adventurous borrowing of previous years to make huge profits, so when the spring cocoons open, they see the limit price of $300. Afterwards, it goes to the market several times a day, straight to the peak. As a result, it actually reached more than $450. There is also a major reason why the cocoon price has reached such a high price. According to local tyrants, hooligans, and those who act illegally, they rely on their means to exploit and bully the villagers near the cocoon shop, forcibly buying at low prices. Villagers who are unwilling are often beaten severely, and they are threatened with weapons. Finally, they set the price themselves and force it on the cocoon shop. The shop owners are forced by their power and have no way to deal with it, so they have to buy it with pain. However, because the quoted price is too high, and villagers who go directly to the shop to sell are already very rare, they have to stop weighing. This situation exists everywhere, which is also an important reason for the huge cost of cocoons. (To be continued)</p>

However, notes with altered place names are common because the foreign banknotes issued by each bank have the same designs and colors as the Shanghai notes. Therefore, many notes from North China have been found with the place names altered to Shanghai. Among them, the China Development Bonds are the most common. The key points for identification can be found in the instructions for altered place name notes of the Bank of Communications. The following is a list of the versions of the Eight Banks banknotes that are still circulating in the market, indicating whether there are altered or counterfeit notes.</p>

<h3 id="e99">"The Path to Failure and Success" <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>— Min Qiang</p>
<p>In order to encourage the public to strive for progress, the YMCA published "The Path to Failure and Success" in various newspapers on October 1st, so that everyone can examine their behavior and avoid falling into a state of drunken stupor. The intention is very good. The content includes aspects of clothing, food, housing, transportation, etiquette, justice, integrity, and shame, totaling 66 items. The fifth item in the "Path to Success" is: Consider the work you are assigned as an opportunity to develop your strengths. The seventh item: Do not waste time on meaningless things. The eighth item: Rest when you should rest, so that you still have energy to spare. The seventeenth item: Do your daily work with enthusiasm, strong methods, and effective methods. And the twenty-third item: Continuously seek knowledge through observation, reading, and prescribed self-study. These five items can be said to be completely aimed at current working youth and students. Nowadays, most young people are very dissatisfied with reality and work. Because of dissatisfaction, they are invisibly divided into two absolutely opposite types of people: one type has a tenacious and upward struggling spirit; the other type is decadent and downward, and this type can also be said to be "captives of reality or captives of work." For this kind of wrong lifestyle or method, the "Path to Failure" has clearly indicated it. As long as we understand the reasons for these failures and follow the "Path to Success," there is no way we cannot improve.</p>
<p>In the "Path to Failure," it also clearly and succinctly points out several important reasons for failure: (1) Sleeping until forced to get up. (2) Seeking only pleasure, regardless of obligations. (3) Avoiding work unless forced to do it. (4) Loving luxury, clothing that is flashy and impractical. (5) Never having creative ideas. ... The five points mentioned above are all problems that young people are most likely to commit.</p>
<p>Young people! This is indeed the path to failure and success. As long as we work hard towards each item on the "Path to Success," there is no way we cannot succeed in our careers and work. Strive in time! Especially the young people of Shanghai, never commit any of the items mentioned in the "Path to Failure" again.</p>
<h3 id="e100">With the Highest Degree of Alertness, Execute Our Work: An Earnest Appeal from a Midwife <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>— Lu Yang</p>
<p>After reading Mr. Li Jie's "Begging for Milk for My Distressed Child" published in this journal on September 25th, a feeling of sympathy arose spontaneously. The death of Mrs. Li not only caused Mr. Li's family to be broken apart, but also gave a serious threat to women who are currently mothers or have not yet become mothers. An innocent woman, while she was looking forward to the joy of becoming a mother, unexpectedly died as a martyr due to the difficulties of childbirth. This is truly a tragic event in the world.</p>
<p>At present, apart from a few pampered wives and young ladies, other women have very little time and ample finances to satisfy their health needs. In addition, society's neglect of them has resulted in thousands of women suffering unjust sacrifices from their own unexplained fates. This situation is inevitably exposed, especially when women are giving birth. Mrs. Li may be one of them, although I cannot know the direct cause of Mrs. Li's death.</p>
<p>I once saw in an obstetrics hospital in Zhejiang Province that many dying mothers were revived under the careful treatment of doctors, and rarely died due to reasons that could not be treated. However, the situation there is different from here; this difference may be the reason why Mrs. Li died! I hope husbands and women who care about this issue will have a common discussion:</p>
<p>(1) Mrs. Li did not go to the hospital for check-ups after becoming pregnant until before delivery, which increased the possibility of death, because there are many reasons that form difficult labor, which can be prevented by human intervention after being discovered in the examination: such as heart disease, lung disease, high blood pressure, abnormal fetal position, placenta previa, oversized fetus, undersized pelvis, etc. Although Shanghai is not short of well-organized and conscientious obstetrics hospitals, how can there not be many who use incomplete obstetrics technology as a means of making a living and treat the lives and happiness of others as child's play! A good hospital will of course remind the pregnant woman to give her a free and careful examination, but those who only want to make money do not care about these things. Many women lack common sense of physiology and medicine, so medical workers should not only be craftsmen, but should also actively promote women's obstetrics knowledge.</p>
<p>(2) Some hospitals charge relatively low fees and have skilled techniques, but it is a big question whether they sincerely do their best for every patient - the mother-to-be. The indifferent attitude of a small number of doctors and midwives is truly shocking to us. For example, postpartum hemorrhage and uterine rupture with internal bleeding in mothers often lead to tragic deaths due to the slow treatment by doctors!</p>
<p>(3) We are of course very sympathetic and grateful for the difficulties and troubles of medical workers. However, if this leads to dereliction of duty in one's own work, it is absolutely unforgivable. "Medical treatment places the highest emphasis on morality." If those seeking treatment are treated indifferently because of their low social and economic status, with careless disinfection and surgery, and disregard for human feelings and the law (in principle, in cases of difficult labor with a risk to life, the hospital should notify the family members to sign before the hospital can perform surgery). For the sake of the happiness of many mothers-to-be, we should expose this kind of fact to society, arouse the attention of people in society, and impose sanctions on those who are irresponsible through public opinion and the law.</p>
<p>Finally, as a midwife, I would like to appeal to medical workers throughout society: let us perform our work with the highest degree of vigilance and sincerity! Since we have come to save humanity from disease and death, let us not let an innocent person die unjustly due to our negligence! For the sake of our own conscience and for the happiness of others!

<p>At the intersection of North Henan Road and Tiantong Road, a middle-aged odd beggar made a unique appeal for assistance. He drew a rice bowl filled with rice on the sidewalk and wrote below: "Alas! Although the rice bowl is full, what can I do if I cannot take it to fill my hunger?" It is conceivable that he has infinite emotion. Later, he attached a couplet: "The same are stomachs, the full do not know the suffering of the hungry; the same are faces, those who are in power should not laugh at those who have lost power." It is also deeply meaningful. For a time, viewers were like a wall, but those who generously donated were still few.</p>

<p>Chapter Eight: Two People Arrested</p>
<p>I couldn't help but give him a hint. I said, "What about that Lu Jiansheng? Could he have beaten Lili Lan to death?"</p>
<p>Anna raised her head to look at me and replied, "Lu Jiansheng? Manager Lu? I don't know." She paused for a moment and then said, "Lili Lan's relationship with Little Yu has always been kept secret from Manager Lu. She thought it was very secretive, but maybe he has seen through it now!"</p>
<p>Hawthorne suddenly shook his head at me and raised new questions on his own. "Miss Jiang, do you know if Lili Lan has a male cousin named Li Shouqi?"</p>
<p>Anna froze for a moment and nodded, "I know. He is not only Lili Lan's cousin, but also her fiancé."</p>
<p>Hawthorne, who had been sitting comfortably with his vest against the back of the chair, suddenly straightened up, and his eyes flashed. This was new information, and I couldn't help but be a little surprised. However, if it goes further, I must admit that Hawthorne's case is complicated, and it is truly "well-founded." Hawthorne still said in a calm voice, "Oh, he is Lili Lan's fiancé? Can you tell me more details?"</p>
<p>Jiang Anna said, "According to Lili Lan, this Li Shouqi is the son of her aunt's husband, and they have been together since childhood. Mr. Hawthorne, you always knew that Lili Lan was raised by her uncle Li Zhiban, so she was betrothed to Xu Qi from a young age. Since Lili Lan came to Shanghai, her vision has naturally changed. That Li Shouqi is a primary school teacher, earning only twenty or thirty yuan a month, and Lili Lan naturally couldn't stand him anymore."</p>
<p>Seeing that Anna paused without saying anything, Hawthorne continued her tone and said, "So Lili Lan advocated breaking off the engagement. Is that right?" Anna nodded and said, "Yes, but this matter has not been settled yet. In the autumn of the year before last, her uncle and his son came to Shanghai and asked Lili Lan to go back and get married. Lili Lan certainly refused, and she also proposed breaking off the engagement, willing to admit some compensation fees. Shouqi's side also refused, so the matter was stalled. Last year, some friends also advised Lili Lan to file a lawsuit, but Lili Lan was a little embarrassed, so it has been delayed until now. Mr. Hawthorne, do you mean Li Shouqi is also involved?"

<p>— Wei Wei</p>
<p>In recent years, there have been more opportunities for Peking opera performers from the north to come south, but almost all of them are rising talents. The older generation, on the other hand, are not given attention and do not have the opportunity to come south. Taking the martial arts actors as an example, the Golden and New China theaters have invited Gao Shenglin, Wu Yanheng, Zhang Yunxi, Yang Shengchun, Chuan Dewei, and others to perform in the south. These are all actors who have only recently emerged. In terms of artistry, each has their own strengths, but in reality, none of them are top figures among the Peking opera martial artists.</p>
<p>Since the passing of Yang Xiaolou and Yu Zhenting, and the retirement of Shang Heyu due to old age, there has been a lack of talent in northern martial arts actors. Taking the best of the lesser talents, Zhou Ruian, Sun Yukun, and Ru Fulan should be considered. Only after these three can Yang Shengchun and Gao Shenglin be considered.</p>
<p>Zhou Ruian is nicknamed "Zhou One-Leg." In fact, no matter how bad his skills may be, in the current situation, he is still the best among the less-than-good. Zhou Ruian has two conditions suitable for a martial arts actor: (1) He has the appearance. (Meaning he has a tall stature and looks good in costume) (2) He has a voice. These two points alone are lacking in most rising martial arts actors today. Ruian's repertoire follows Xiaolou, because Xiaolou sold his appearance and voice, and Ruian happens to have these two characteristics, so he learned from Xiaolou very well. His best works are "The Leopard," "Falling Horse Lake," "The Chain Set," "Evil Tiger Village," and other plays. Ruian's biggest problem in performing is "overdoing it." In recent years, due to age, his martial skills have also deteriorated slightly. These are his shortcomings. However, when it comes to singing the civil and martial plays of Huang Tianba, such as "Falling Horse Lake," "The Chain Set," and "Evil Tiger Village," he is still considered the best after Xiaolou's death.</p>
<p>Sun Yukun's original name was Xiao Zhenting. He is Yu Zhenting's nephew. His repertoire originally combined the strengths of the Yu and Yang schools, because he also has "the appearance." He also has "the voice." Some people think that Yukun's artistry is above Ruian's, but this is not true. Yukun's experience and mastery are certainly not as good as Ruian's. Yukun's problem is the opposite of Ruian's, which is that he likes to be lazy in his performances, leading to the fault of being "understated." However, Yukun's strengths are actually more than Ruian's, namely his solid martial skills. Therefore, on the surface, it seems that Yukun is better than Ruian. Yukun's repertoire now has more of the "Yang" style. He did receive guidance from Xiaolou, but Yukun is not good at Xiaolou's most famous civil and martial plays, such as "The Chain Set" and "Falling Horse Lake." Yukun's best works are the painted-face plays of "Iron Dragon Mountain" and "Top Scholar Seal," and the leaning-on-the-back plays of "Green Stone Mountain Sled Ride." This is also different from Ruian.</p>
<p>As for Ru Fulan, although he also learned the Yang school, he is at a disadvantage because he is short and has nearsightedness. As a result, it is difficult for him to compare with Zhou and Sun in performing Yang school plays. However, Shen Lan has his own specialties, namely being good at performing martial arts young male roles, such as "Visiting the Village," "Night Flight," and "Eight Hammers." Not only are Zhou and Sun far behind, but he can be said to be the best among martial arts actors. Moreover, he can maintain the rules of the performance, being neither understated nor overstated. His body and voice are all excellent. Therefore, although this person has shortcomings compared to Ruian and Yukun, he also has advantages that surpass Ruian and Yukun.</p>
<p>Recently, I heard that Golden has invited Ru Fulan, and New China also plans to invite Sun Yukun to come south after Wu Suqiu. At the same time, I also learned that Zhou Ruian will also come to perform with Meng Xiaodong at the end of the year. From this, we can see that the Shanghai theater scene has noticed the older generation of martial arts actors, so today I will discuss these three people together.</p>

<p>— A Han</p>
<p>October, the second day, forms a kind of storm in the terrifying air of rain, but the earth struggles through, and the green sky and white sun are so bright and radiant! Yes, this is a symbol of the season, symbolizing that the season of October is great. In this great season of October, our theater scene is also very bright and radiant, unfolding a page of historical drama season.</p>
<p>Just after the New Art Theater gave the audience food for thought with "The Heroes of the Sea," the China Travel Troupe once again performed "Li Xiangjun." This play has won extremely high praise, revealing the turbulence of the scholar-official class in the great era, so tragic, but so positive.</p>
<p>As for the Shanghai Drama Society, in addition to premiering Yu Ling's year-long work, "The Heroes of the Ming Dynasty," followed by "Ge Nen Niang" and "Li Xiucheng's Martyrdom," both of which expose the focus of the great era struggle and enlighten the public to walk together!</p>
<p>Standing in the position of the audience, in addition to welcoming the great day in October with enthusiastic emotions, we also express our excitement for the above-mentioned historical dramas with a sense of the times. Really, we will always remember that history can reflect the times, and the times are the history of the future!</p>
<h3 id="e107">Premiering "The Heroes of the Ming Dynasty" and Holding a Historical Drama Season <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>— Lin</p>
<p>Yu Ling's new work, "The Heroes of the Ming Dynasty," which has taken more than a year to prepare, will be premiered today. Its content is about how Liu Bowen called on the people and contacted Zhu Yuanzhang and Chang Yuchun to rise up and fight for the great cause of freedom together. In the middle, it interweaves the suffering of the people under oppression, how they shed blood and sacrificed, and the solemnity of the heroes, which is unprecedented in the history of historical drama. The director is the set expert Xu Qu, who, in addition to trying to beautify the performance form, has had a long-term discussion with the actual set designer Chi Ning, striving to create another new style and refresh the audience. Han Fei's acting skills have made great progress in the past six months. He plays Liu Bowen here, full of elegance and very humorous. Xia Xia plays Su Jiaojiao, and of course, she is very competent and happy. Xu Li plays the villain Zhang Liangbi. Anyone who has seen "Liang Hongyu" and "Ge Nen Niang" knows that he is good at this type of play. In short, the Drama Society regards "The Heroes of the Ming Dynasty" as the biggest play in the autumn season, so it has poured the greatest manpower and material resources into performing this play. The Drama Society has also decided to hold an unprecedented "Historical Drama Season" from now on, successively performing several historical dramas, such as Wei Ruhui's "Ge Nen Niang" and Yang Hansheng's "Li Xiucheng's Martyrdom," both of which are the society's masterpieces. The premiere will definitely arouse great interest from the audience! Held by the American Women's Association</p>

This concert is entirely vocal music, and the performers are all Zhao Meibo's proud students. This summer, they participated in the Municipal Council Orchestra's performance and participated in singing at the Zhaofeng Garden and the American Navy's worship service at the Great Brightness Theater, which was highly praised by Chinese and foreign people. Most of the songs they sing this time are selected from operas. The female performers are Qian Jinhua, Li Yingzhi, Cheng Jingzi, Zhu Qi, Sun Meikun, Xu Huian, and Lao Moyi; the male performers are Tian Mingsi, Xia Anxun, Ge Chaozhi, and Huang Zhongming. Seats can be reserved at Mou Deli and Yongxing Piano Store.</p>

The director is Zhu Shilin. It is heard that all sections involving foreigners have been discarded, for fear of causing negotiations. Gu Lanjun's self-funded production of "Money and Love" has not yet been completed. Because the location of "Sai Jinhua" conflicts, it will be temporarily suspended.</p>
<h3 id="e110">Ma Zhanghua to Be Engaged Tomorrow <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang</p>
<p>Ma Zhanghua, a famous Yue opera actress, is both beautiful and talented. She is very popular at the Da Lai Theater, and her performances are very popular. She is scheduled to be engaged to Mr. Bao Sunzhu at the Atlantic Western Restaurant on the afternoon of the 5th. Mr. Bao is currently studying at a certain middle school and is the eldest son of Mr. Bao Dingbang. He and Miss Ma met more than half a year ago. Initially, Mr. Bao's mother was very fond of Yue opera and went to the Da Lai Theater to watch the play every day. She was very fond of Ma, and she had long intended for Miss Ma to be her future daughter-in-law. She then asked someone to introduce them. As a result, Ma and Bao traveled back and forth from time to time. After half a year of friendship, they actually fell in love, and with the permission of both parents, they decided to get engaged. It is said that the officiant will be Huang Yuzhai.</p>
<h3 id="e111">On the Destiny of Actors as Determined by Their Names (3) <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>A few days ago, I talked about the names of actors being related to their destiny, and that those with more even tones in their names have better luck. I have already listed some names of senior male actors. Now, I will list the names of female roles, painted-face roles, clown roles, young male roles, martial arts roles, and old female roles to support my theory.</p>
<p>Female Roles: The predecessors of female roles, Wu Shunlin, Qiao Huilan, Sun Caizhu, and Chen Delin, all have two even tones in their three-character names. Only Wang Yaoqing has three even tones, two yang and one yin. In her later years, she had many male and female students and was still known as the Tongtian Sect Leader. Among the four famous female roles, Cheng and Xun both have two even tones, Shang only has one even tone, while Mei Lanfang alone has three even tones. Therefore, public opinion pushed Mei to win the championship, while Shang was at the end of the line. Zhu Youfen, Wang Huifang, Feng Zihe, and Jia Biyun, who were contemporaries of Mei, had different reputations, careers, and endings than Mei. Their names only had one or two even tones outside of Mei's. Mao Shilai and Song Dezhu, who performed at the Golden Theater last year, were similar in art, qualifications, and age, but Mao was more popular. Mao's name has two yang even tones, while Song has one, and it is a yin even tone. Mao's name sounds louder when pronounced in the northern dialect? (The names of actors must be pronounced in the northern dialect. Even tones sound loud, and yang even tones sound even louder. If pronounced in the southern dialect, the opposite is true, and it is not accurate. The northern dialect area is vast, so the northern sound is the standard.) Among the six female actors who appeared on the New China stage one after another, Wu, Zhao, Liang, Zheng, and Liang, five of them had two even tones in their names, while Li Yanxiu was weaker. According to my theory, the biggest reason is that all three characters are oblique tones, and they do not sound loud when pronounced. Now, Tong Zhiling, who is singing at the Golden Theater, became popular with a single cotton flower, isn't it also due to the power of the loud pronunciation of the two yang even tones of "Tong" and "Ling"? If the name doesn't sound, then the singing won't be popular. This is what it means.</p>
<p>Painted-Face Roles: Hao Shouchang and Hou Xirui were the two strongest painted-face actors in the north, but when Jin Shaoshan arrived, he replaced Zhao's banner with Han's banner and easily became the leader, because Jin has two even tones, while Hao and Hou each have one even tone. In the later emerging painted-face roles, there are Wang Quankui and Liu Lianrong, both of whom have three yang even tones. After Shaoshan, these two will be the ones who enjoy great fame. Someone may say, "Qiu Shengrong is also not without hope," but the "Sheng" character in Shengrong is an oblique tone, which is a big burden. It's like getting a "middle-low" fortune slip in front of the gods. I recently heard that he has a scandal, which is exactly this sign.</p>
<p>Clown Roles: The clown roles who enjoyed great fame and a long life, the deceased Wang Changlin, and the currently healthy Xiao Changhua, both have three even tones in their names. Wang's name is more prosperous than Xiao's, because the "Wang" character is yang, while the "Xiao" character is yin. I can't think of anyone else with three even tones, only Ci Ruiquan, who has two yang even tones, is now also called a fruitful result. But there is Ma Fulu, who is very popular, and all three characters are oblique tones, but his luck is very good. This is an exception, or it may be due to the circumstances, which I cannot fathom.</p>
