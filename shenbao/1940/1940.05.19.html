<p>社評</p>
<h3>從鄂北之戰論日本前途</h3>
<p>本月初旬起，鄂豫邊區的日軍的七師團之衆，以豫南的信陽和鄂北的隨縣鍾祥爲基點，向西展開了一次新的進攻；其目的當不外：（一）企圖爭取華軍的根據地桐柏山區域；（二）謀占襄樊；（三）假如以上兩點都達到了，那麼，武漢區的日軍地位纔能鞏固，這是因爲襄樊桐柏居高臨下，處於控制地位之故。但是鏖戰十日，卒因在正面受華軍的堅强抵抗，在兩翼及後路受華軍的多方襲擊，日軍西犯企圖，終歸全敗，狼狽潰退；連日華軍迭克雙溝唐縣鎭長台關等要地後，正施展其追擊工作，圍殲殘日，並於十六日收復棗陽，棗陽地處桐柏大洪兩山之間，是襄樊的門戶，鄂北的重鎭，華軍竟能一舉克復，英勇可知；雖在華日軍總參謀長板垣親飛前綫指揮，卒不能挽回頹勢，日軍這一塲慘敗，可算敗得澈底了。</p>
<p>我們假如再進一步觀察，不難知道這一次日軍在鄂豫邊境的慘敗，其意義實非常重大：這不僅是日軍在鄂北一隅的失敗，而且是日方基本戰略的失敗；不僅是一時的失敗，而且是終極失敗的前奏，原來日本對華作戰的基本戰略原則，是求吞滅全中國，獨覇遠東，日本所高唱的口號，無論是政治上的「建設東亞新秩序」也好，經濟上的「日滿支一元」也好，乃至軍事上的「緊密合作共同防共」也好，其用意，都在配合這個「吞滅全中國獨覇遠東」的戰略原則。但因中國英勇抗戰持久抗戰之故，遂使日本想要一口鯨吞中國爲決不可能，於是去年西尾和板垣來華後，又略修改其戰略原則，爲在華北作「面的肅淸」，華中作「綫的占領」，華南作「點的確守」，他們原想等到華北澈底「肅淸」了，再來滅華中，華中滅了，再滅華南。以上是日軍侵華的基本戰略原則。至其具體的戰略手段，則歸納觀察，不外四項，即：（一）充分發揮其機械化設備之優點，迅速機動，先聲奪人；（二）在正面探檢華軍之弱點，實行中央突破；（三）在側翼尋求可供利用之捷徑，實行迂迴進擊；（四）努力引誘華軍之主力，求達速戰速決之目的。這四項戰略手段，幾乎是日方每戰必用的。</p>
<p>但是時問是日本的大敵。隨着戰爭時間的長期延展，客觀局勢也起着變化，日本的戰略原則和戰略手段，遂不得不受新的作戰環境的限制，和新的國際形勢的掣肘，而使其前途日趨於黯淡，日近於沒落。以言新的作戰環境，在日軍作戰對象即中國方面，其政治之統一鞏固，建設之飛躍發展，新軍之質量並進，民氣之沉着强毅，愈經艱苦，愈見成功，凡此一切，洵爲日本當初所未及料，遂使日閥企圖對於華北華中華南各個擊破的詭謀爲不可能，而不得不與整個中國爲敵，不得不與整個中國作戰。這樣，日軍欲分在「華北作面的肅淸，華中作綫的占領，華南作點的確守」的基本戰略原則，便也不得不歸於幻滅。次在日本本身方面，其可供動員之兵額，從寬估計，爲四百餘萬人，除已傷亡的一百五十萬人外，現在中國境內作戰及駐屯服役者，的二百萬，其不敷分配的拮据之狀，早已顯露無遺，即使再將所餘的數十萬乃至百餘萬人全數調華，殆亦少有改善現行局勢之望。何况七七以來，日本侵華軍費已達二三，二七〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇圓，其公債發行額已逾二〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇圓，而去年日本對外貿易（所謂「日圓集團」以外）之入超亦達四〇五·四二六·〇〇〇圓，這些天文學的數字，日本如何長期負擔得下！加之中國的地形，東部平坦，而西境多山，自從主要戰塲西移入丘陵山地區域以後，日軍機械化的設備，即不能充分發揮其威力，運輸補充，尤感困難。日方兵員旣不足，故其進攻，常陷入華軍的反包圍，並遭受華軍的反殲滅。去年五月鄂北之戰，十月湘北之戰，今年二月桂南之戰，乃至最近鄂豫邊區之戰，情形都一樣；不過日軍損失，殆以最近這次爲更大而已。這又證明日軍的戰略手段，也因不能適應新的作戰環境而弱化了。以言國際形勢之演變，日本也許將以歐戰之擴太爲慶，但有可斷言者，歐戰愈擴大愈緊張，則美國對遠東的反侵略政策必將愈積極愈强硬，所以美國的擴軍增防，並不以大西洋爲主要對象，而集中全力於太平洋之經營，這又是日本武力侵華所引起的不能克復的困難。</p>
<p>總之，目前日本的處境，可說正在一種因果相生的困難狀態中，亦即正在循環的矛盾狀態中。就對華論，則徘徊於軍事侵略與政治侵略之間，作戰失敗了，轉而乞靈於對南京的改組，改組南京顯然不能收功，又轉而發動鄂北戰事，終亦陷於慘敗之境。就對外論，則日閥侵華失利之時，亦即有田高唱南進之日，從而愈益引起美國反感，亦即愈增日本侵華之困難。如此循環不已，矛盾日增，日本前途，寧復有一綫光明之望？鄂北敗戰，僅爲其加速崩潰的序幕而已。</p>

<h3>唐名妓薛濤井畔　錦江斷流繼續掘金（續）　張獻忠藏金數萬於錦江下　望江樓頭正用科學方法挖掘</h3>
<p>五月二日、在石牛背後、又挖出石條七十餘根、仍多有字跡和「（一）」的符號、石條下、均有平鋪的無數朽木、更在下面挖得張獻忠所鑄的大順錢數枚、是爲微候之七、</p>
<p>去年今日開工兩個多月、就發現這許多徵候、不但公司方面的益信記載和考證的不無原因、社會的人聽說、也沒有不興奮的、</p>
<p>科學的證明</p>
<p>去春施工的結果、雖然獲得了不少的徵候、但沙洲下面、究竟有無寳藏、却是一個謎，用什麽科學方法來加以證明呢、停工十月期間、公司方面、全部精神都集中在這個問題的解决、用探鑽機探探罷、施工的地方、適在江心、地層全是沙石、使用探鑽機很感困難、最後、決定用無綫電探金儀、探査有無金屬的蘊藏、去年秋、聘請徐韋立·張仲華劉浮伯三個鑛工專家、在成都監製、經過數月的工夫、探金器於是做好、</p>
<p>探金儀製成、儀器是否準確、這是値得注意的問題、爲了試騐探金儀的効能、公司方面的負責人和三個專家、又和成都啟明電達公司接洽、試測電燈公司的地下電綫、試測的結果、非常圓滿、地下電綫的路綫、完全由這件探金儀測繪出來了、</p>
<p>探金儀是根據無綫電平衡原理製造的、利用一具有定向的天綫發報機、和有定向天綫收報機、在無金屬處調節、至無聲可聞、（即平衡位置）固定收發機的相互位置、在金屬的地方、因金屬反射電波之故、失其平衡、而收信機中發如鐘鳴狀的感應、</p>
<p>從今春一月起、開始探査沙洲、確有金屬的反應、皆係人爲的幾何形狀、面積的一百平方丈、其餘的零星小塊金屬地方亦不少、埋藏的深淺、和究爲何種金屬、尙不能判斷、</p>
<p>一天、他們用探金儀在施工地探着玩、忽然發現一個圓圈的金屬感應、圓圈的內外、却毫無什麽反應、圈的直的一市尺半、爲了好奇心的驅使、他們開始挖掘、掘至四尺深的地方、突然發現了一個無首底的洋鐵盆、把洋盆取出、再用探余儀探測、則毫無感應了、至今公司的員工、都把這件事當爲美談、</p>
<p>繼續的挖掘</p>
<p>望江樓頭薛濤井畔、在馬達聲四溢的科學氣氛中、富饒古色古香趣味的工程、又於春風蕩漾下繼續進行、相信藏有無限財寳的沙洲上、去歲掘獲的石牛石鼓、仍默然遙對着、石牛的右耳、不知被誰打斷了、殘耳半片、棄置於牛背上、枯骨石條、和經探金儀測獲的洋鐵盆殘骸、雜堆沙角、供人參觀、相傳張獻忠藏金時、曾斷江截流現在掘金雖未斷江、却予以截流、江水原來沿着沙洲右岸流過、現已將來截住、使改從左岸下流了、用掘金掘出來的土、沿岸高築堤堰、這樣大水時期、仍可照常施工、</p>
<p>沙洲的中央、高聳着一個大木桶、下面接在一個鐵筋洋灰桶上、洋灰桶已深陷地下、木桶的直徑有一丈多、蹬着梯子爬到桶上向下看幾個工人正在底下挖沙掘泥、浸出來的水、都用馬達抽水機瀉入江中、四月底掘井式方法探掘的深度、已達丈許、探金儀探測的結果、這裏的反應最大、所以決定繼續下掘至五丈六丈、看情形再爲定奪、去春施工地點、距沉桶不過三丈、現在也在動工下掘、這邊仍沿用舊法、用龍骨車排水、工人笑嘻嘻的蹬轉車輪、引洩浸水、歌聲蕩浮江上、悠然神怡、天眞而快樂、</p>
<p>不時有些人到這裏來參觀、林主席和陳誠部長、都來參觀過、華僑回國慰勞團、五月三日傍晚、也來參觀、美國米高梅公司、特派攝影師王小亭來成都把掘金的情形、拍成影片、錦江掘金工程、確已轟傳中外了，但是究竟能吾在這裏掘出江藏呢、尙待事實的證明、不過公司方面、這種「奪可求之勿得不能知而不爲」的精神、實在値得欽佩、（五月三日）（完）</p>

<h3>交戰國駐華防軍　決維持華中現狀　赫德與各國司令協商決定　義縱參戰與上海局勢無關</h3>
<p>歐洲局勢、目下已日趨嚴重、同時、地中海上之義大利國、劍拔弩張、伺機而動、據種種徵象觀察之、似義國傾向納粹方面、宣佈參戰、已迫在眉睫、義國在滬素有駐防之海軍陸戰隊一隊、其防區在公共租界西區之勞勃生路一帶、與大西路一帶之英國防軍鄰接、而其南則有法租界之法國防軍、倘使義國果與德國駢肩對英法作戰、則本埠之歐洲各國防軍、其處境勢必甚爲嚴重、關於此點、茲悉此間各國防軍領袖、已妥籌辦法、昨日始經外人方面發表、</p>
<p>各國防軍　重要會商</p>
<p>蓋本月七日、美亞洲艦隊司令長官赫德上將邀集駐華中各歐洲國家防軍司令官、作試探性之談話、當經一致欣然同意、縱使歐洲戰局更趨擴大、影響及於各該駐軍之本國、但此間之現狀、務予維持、是項協定、並適用於華北之各國駐軍、是則歐洲局勢萬一益趨惡化、本埠形勢、亦無足慮、况有美國居間、可仲裁一切、則前途自可坦然無虞也、</p>
<p>英文大美晚報云、今日（十八日）據宣布、美國亞洲艦隊總司令赫德海軍大將、本月七日與駐華中歐洲諸國軍隊司令官舉行探問性質之會談、各司令官迅皆同意在歐戰繼續擴大而影響彼等本國時、各就其權力所及、以維持華中及華北駐軍之和平現狀、</p>
<p>日報紀載　大肆挑撥</p>
<p>惟此事在本埠日方方面、則取沉機觀變之態度、認爲事勢發展、極爲嚴重、素被視爲華中日軍機關報之日文大陸新報、昨晨著文、涉及此事、一則稱、即使上海各國防軍領袖有所議協、但交戰國之此間防軍、仍有「不測事件」發生之可能、二則稱、此間之外國防軍當局、外交界方面、以及外國商行、對義大利之動態、其注意有甚信德國在歐洲前綫之强力突擊者、措辭處處帶恫嚇性質、探其用意、似與去年九月、歐戰爆發之初、日本政府即要求歐洲各交戰國家、撤退其華（日方侵佔區部份）駐軍、以免發生衝突之舉、同出一轍、彼時英法方面、以德國在華並無駐軍、不致發生衝突一點拒之、至今後發展、則因美司令赫德上將高瞻遠矚、未雨綢繆、鄭重取得各歐洲國家防軍領袖之維持現狀之一致保證、則地中海之局勢、果爾惡化、日方亦無從藉口改變上海租界防軍之現狀也、</p>
<p>法公董局　滙款祖國</p>
<p>法租界公董局、近已決定、將該局所可調用之款、悉數購買法國政府軍需公債、計五百萬佛郞（市價每元可購二佛郞九〇）且聞此款、現已匯達巴黎財政部核收、法公董局此舉、乃係倣效法國境中若干城市之所爲、</p>
<p>外僑捐款　援助荷蘭</p>
<p>據荷總領白斯凡氏宣稱、本埠外僑沙遜氏等同情荷蘭抗戰、昨日捐贈荷蘭紅十字會之款、已有法幣一萬五千元、荷領館已加接受、即將匯往祖國、</p>
<p>對華貿易　大受打擊</p>
<p>大陸報云最近期密勒氏評論報載文稱、德國侵略荷比兩國、不利於歐洲對華貿易、德國苟佔荷比、則該兩國對遠東之商業、將自動停止、因協約國仍控制海面也、就他方面言、德方攻勢、若告失敗、而荷比防綫未破、則兩國必自經濟上活動、轉而致力於防務之維持、其輸出縱不完全停止、亦當大减、比國對華貿易、頗爲重要、中國輸入之鋼板與電料等物、迄以比貨居首位、近月來荷船在上海外國航業佔第八位、而在全中國各口岸、佔第六位、荷船退出遠東、將使泰西在遠東之航業地位、大爲减弱、</p>
<p>爪哇貨幣　聯繫美元</p>
<p>據本埠外商銀行界方面探悉、關於荷蘭本國貨幣與荷屬東印度貨幣（即爪哇荷盾）脫離聯繫、而另與美元聯繫一事、昨晨業已實行、因此本埠外商銀行、於昨日起又開爪哇荷盾匯價、計法幣百元、折合爪哇荷盾爲十盾一二五、蓋即爪哇荷盾與美元、匯率之比爲二與一、至於荷蘭本國貨幣、猶未開出行情、</p>
<p>法意郵船　力事鎭定</p>
<p>本市外灘九號法國郵船公司、因地中海局勢朝不保夕、爲防避一旦發生危險、已於前日起對該公司郵船之進出之日期及航程、一律嚴守秘密、不再預吿、惟據消息靈通方面稱、該公司迄昨日爲止、尙未接有巴黎方面繞道之命令、故郵船或仍將經由地中海往來、至意國郵船公司態度、頗爲緘默、似在靜觀時局之變化、惟據該公司中人語記者、在最短期內、該公司之航程及班次、不致有何變動、</p>
<p>法軍司令　茶會盛况</p>
<p>法文上海日報云、法駐軍司令愛蘇第大佐夫婦、前晚（十七日）在祁齊路私邸、舉行茶會、計到法大使戈思默代表畢各特·比大使紀佑穆義·大使馬秀夫人·波蘭代辦羅賽特·英國總領事喬琪·比國總領事巨脫森·荷蘭總領事白斯凡·西班牙總領事意加爾·美國亞洲艦隊司令赫德·英國揚子江艦隊司令格拉斯福·美國巡洋艦「奧古斯達」號司令馬格魯德·日本駐軍司令長谷川·英國駐軍司令西門斯·美國海軍陸戰隊第四聯隊司令威德柏克·意大利「桑麻哥」海軍陸戰隊司令莫朗德·法總領事奧琪·法海軍「加爾尼」軍艦艦長魯賓·上海區法軍司令亞狄哥斯·軍雷長兼空軍參贊吉佛丹、此外尙有法國本國及各國駐滬使領館駐軍會司部各官員、英法兩租界高級職員等、來賓三百五十餘人、極一時之盛、</p>
<h3>美對外貿易週開始　中外同聲慶祝　今日爲國際親善星期日　二十二日爲美國航務節</h3>
<p>美國對外貿易週、於今日開始、昨據探悉、本埠美國商會、舉行兩大慶祝典禮、預定下星期五（二十五日）、假美僑總會、聯合美國大學總會、舉行午宴、招待本年赴美留學之中國學生、由本埠美國學七校學生十餘人及其家屬陪座、晚設盛大宴會、招待本埠美僑、放映電影、舉行名人演說、</p>
<p>國際親善</p>
<p>英文大美晚報云、旅滬美僑、在美商會領導下、定本月十九日至一一十五日之一週中、紀念「美國對外貿易週」、十九日名曰「國際親善星期日」、美敎堂與宗敎團體、將有特殊紀念節目、午前十時、美海軍第四陸戰隊隨軍牧師瑪根大尉主持在大光明戲院舉行特殊禮拜、請美亞洲艦隊隨軍牧師鄧斯屈萊中校到塲講道、題目爲「國際親善」、午前十一時、美國社交會堂舉行紀念禮拜、午後七時、海軍靑年會亦舉行禮拜、由史密斯演講「中美關係、歡迎公衆聽講、</p>
<p>航務令節</p>
<p>又本月二十二日爲義國航務節、是日旅滬美僑將在住宅、商號及汽車上懸美旗、以示紀念、按五月二十日乃美國商船薩凡那號即全球第一艘橫渡大西洋之汽船、離美開航之日、故定爲航務節、</p>

<h3>工部局關懷民困　令商店迅减物價　法幣回漲物價自應削减　倘再操縱卽予嚴厲制裁</h3>
<p>工部局鑒於上海匯價劇變、各項物價、紛紛任意在抬、近來匯市轉好、而物價未見自動抑低、影響市民生計匪淺、爰於本（十八）日分函各有關係商業團體等等、促令分飭所屬各會員商店、尅日减低售價、一面切實遵照該局第五二三三號布吿所規定之辦法辦理、倘有違延、定當嚴懲、茲錄其原函如下、</p>
<p>主要物品　應卽標價</p>
<p>査本局爲維持界內治安起見、近曾訂有改善社會生活狀况之辦法、但貴會之若干會員、迄未遵照本局第五二三三號布吿、將所售主要物品價格、開示揭示、並著籤標明、茲特函請貴會轉促各該會員急速注意、並即遵照本局所訂辦法辦理、勿再遲延、</p>
<p>幣値回漲　物價應减</p>
<p>近數日來、中國法幣價値、業已增高、第零售店肆、所開物價、减削極少、或竟未减、此種情形、當亦爲貴會所見及、因匯價降低而增加之物價、至中國法幣價格回漲時、（除非能提出可令本局滿意之理由）自應减低、應請貴會轉吿各會員、滙價一經好轉、務須將零售物價、立即削减、俾一般民衆、共蒙其利、</p>
<p>破壞法令　從嚴取締</p>
<p>倘仍蔑視關於必需品之本局各布吿、並有壟斷投機或囤積各項主要物品情事、本局當採取相當步驟、加以制裁、最後本局尙須聲明、局中對於正當營業、或其所得公尤合法之利潤、並無干涉或限制之意、但如繼續索價過分、並再圖破壞本局所訂改善社會生活狀况之辦法、不得不從嚴取締、以顧全民衆之鷓利、爲免除誤會起見、茲將此次通函及本局第五二三三號布吿、譯成華文、隨函附送、統希査照、</p>
<p>煤球市價　卽將慘跌</p>
<p>本市煤屑市塲、因外匯猛鬆、市價傾瀉後、茲以到貨仍極湧旺、故價格尙將在跌、昨日海南羅勒輪抵滬、自法屬裝來鴻基白煤屑三千餘噸、當茲囤戶紛圖脫手之際、外煤再行湧到、市價益將暴瀉、自屬必然、煤球市價、已四度回跌、即首次十二元、第二次二元、第三次六元、第四次四元、但合計每噸僅回跌二十四元、現每噸廠盤一百五十二元、昨日各項煤斤、俱有猛跌局勢、結果卒告維持原狀、惟現貨驟增、鮮人問津、</p>
<p>汽油汽水　同時减價</p>
<p>本埠美孚亞細亞德士古三大汽油公司、因日來外滙好轉、爲顧及市民利益起見、於昨日實行每加倫汽油减價兩角、按自本月四日起每加倫汽油由二元九角加至三元五角、而自昨日起則减至三元三角、正廣和公司於本月九日曾預吿加價百分之三十、茲亦聲明取消、希望其他行家爲公益起見、急起效法、</p>
<h3>各界同情比國抗戰　將有熱切表示　籌款捐助傷兵難民醫藥　蔡壽康等擬訪問比大使</h3>
<p>中比關係、素稱敦睦、自互派大使後、國交更形親密、比國文化、發達甚早、足與中國媲美、而近代藝術之進步、尤爲世界各國所驚佩、故中國靑年學子、前往比國留學習藝者、殊不亞於央法美等諸國也、對援助款項、捐輸藥品等工作、比國亦盡最大之努力、</p>
<p>邦交素篤</p>
<p>中國自滬戰爆發、比國即開始是類工作、二年前、留學生監督某君、在比曾對比國各界聲請援助中國醫藥經費、其中有警句曰「諸君如擬一法郞捐助西班牙、不如輸與中國、蓋輸一法郞於西班牙、不能援救一人、在中國則可治療五人至十人也、」詞畢、頃刻即集得鉅軟百餘萬、可見比利時對中國實力之援助、一固超於一般同情之上自紀佑穆大使呼籲宣言發表後、本埠各界及留比同學等曁大使親故、因比國對華友好之精神、數十年如一日、而中比兩國現在之情形、亦復相同、</p>
<p>籌議援助</p>
<p>在萬般困難狀態中、忍籌集款項、作爲救濟傷兵難民之醫藥費用、聊以表示中國各界息息相關之至意、聞比駐華救濟會主辦之慈惠醫院院長蔡壽康及名雕塑家張充仁等、於前日集議籌款計劃、凝於明日晋竭大使、建議方案、如蒙尤准、即着手進行云、（按慈惠慈安兩醫院、係比國駐華救濟會獨立主辦、創立於一九三八年二月、規模宏大、三年來耗費近百萬元、收容中國平民、完全係義務性質、並設有鑺錠院、凡重症均由該處治療、）</p>
<h3>挪威國慶紀念　四國領事廣播　法比荷挪四領同具信心　駢肩作戰爭取最後勝利</h3>
<p>英文大美晚報云、本月十七日爲挪威頒布憲法之第一二六週年紀念日、駐華挪威代辦克紐崇及其夫人、特於是日假座法國拍球總會、招待本國僑民、到二百餘人、內有挪船船員多人、克氏即席致詞、檢討挪威局勢之新近發展、並稱挪王赫康之行爲、乃挪威愛國人民皆應倣效之先例、克氏結尾、堅決表示挪人對最後勝利之信心、並舉觴爲國王與祖國壽、在座挪人、一致熱烈應和、</p>
<p>駢肩作戰　工作艱鉅</p>
<p>字林西報云駐滬法·比·荷·挪四國總領事、於本月十七日即挪威國慶紀念日夜間、假法國無綫電臺、各向本國僑民致廣播演說、首由法總領事歐仁致詞、略稱、今夜余在此歡迎挪·荷·比三國代表向其旅居上海及全中國之僑民演說、殊感欣幸、際此最偉大時期、從挪威以至瑞士邊界之陸海空戰塲、發生有史以來最慘烈之戰事、法·英·波·捷·挪·荷·比國三軍正沿此巨大前綫、駢肩搏戰、負有擊退文明世界所未有的最兇猛攻擊之艱難任務、</p>
<p>冰天雪地　挪軍苦鬥</p>
<p>歐仁轉向挪威領事吉台爾稱、余謹以國人及本人名義、向貴國表最深切之間情、受貴國民衆愛戴之國王赫康、以六旬高齡、跋涉奔波、不失其鎭定與堅決、實樹勇毅之先例、荷·比·法境內之大戰未使我人忽視挪軍在冰天雪地中奮戰、以截斷敵人獲取瑞典曠源之路綫云、</p>
<p>荷女王之　受人愛戴</p>
<p>歐仁續向荷總領事鮑賽文致詞謂、貴國女王威廉明昨發簡潔而堅毅之演說、全世界深爲感動、尤以美國爲最、吾人決不被人征服、而抵抗之願望、決不更變、貴國女王之演詞與比王利奧波德向列日守軍所發「抵抗到底、以救祖國」一語、將垂諸不朽、</p>
<p>法比共同　作戰到底</p>
<p>歐仁又向比總領事克森致詞稱、貴我兩國軍隊、兩次駢肩作戰、而列日·那穆爾·色當等城、兩次罹刧、歷史已重演矣、在此作戰一週後之今日、德軍進攻、已被阻於我聯軍銅牆鐵壁之前、希特勒必將遇戚廉二世之同樣命運、吾人將作戰到底、俾在世上重樹歡樂、即獲取以自由與文明爲基礎之永久和平是、法國萬歲、協約國萬歲、</p>
<p>挪領發表　沉痛演說</p>
<p>歐仁詞畢、演奏法國國歌、繼由吉台爾操挪語向陸上及海中挪僑演說、略述挪威國慶日之意義後、稱、今日德兵已統制挪威南部與中部、其行爲恰如吾人所料、我王近曾云、一德人在挪威進行者、並非戰爭而係屠殺、」蓋敵人行爲、慘無人道、城市之全被摧毀者、可略舉數名、如克列斯丁森·摩爾特·愛爾夫倫、與里爾哈摩等、皆無軍事目標。第一次世界大戰時、德人曾在比國出此行爲、而巳往數日來、又在荷比肆虐矣、</p>
<p>荷僑堅信　最後勝利</p>
<p>次由鮑賽文演說、略述本月十日德軍開始進攻荷蘭後之經過、謂、荷蘭向以和平發展人類繁榮與歡樂爲目的、今吾人不必沮喪、須爲將來而努力、堅信吾人所寳愛的公道與自由之原則、終必勝利、吾人旣未喪失光榮、亦未稍减信心、</p>
<p>籲請援助　比國紅會</p>
<p>末由克森向旅華比僑演說稱、比國今遭二十五年來之第二次侵略、吾人又憶及世界大戰時之黑暗時期及其慘狀、吾人現須自省者、吾人在此豈與可怖之博鬥相距迢遠乎、應如何援助今受痛苦之同胞乎、克森結尾籲請比國友人慷慨捐助比國紅十字會、以照料被德人野蠻行爲所逐、而流離矢所之比國人民、</p>

<h3>工部局銓叙會攷慮　雇員待遇　薪給及養老金問題　昨日會議曾加討論</h3>
<p>上海泰晤士報云、工部局新成立之銓叙委員會、星期四日午後、在工部局大厦舉行會議、聞席聞曾討論工部局雇員薪給問題、及修正領取養老金規則之建議、會議後、局方雖</p>
<p>無所發表</p>
<p>惟聞該委員會對生活程度近趨高漲事、已加考慮、並决定將其建議書提交財務委員會、的一週前、謠傳工部局雇員薪給、將續增百分之二十至廿五、惟銓叙委員會除提出建議書外、已吾商得其他决議</p>
<p>尙未確知</p>
<p>財務委員會接獲建議書、加以相當考慮後、將呈交工部局、作最後之核准、觀於物價之日漲、預料有關各委員會、對於此事、將儘速促其實行、</p>
<h3>投機家　空前厄運　美貨跌價股票猛瀉　投磯損失二千餘萬</h3>
<p>本埠以囤積貨物之各大投機家、現已遭遇慘苦之嚴重打擊、其虧損之鉅大、實爲上海每一金融風潮中所僅見、據平明社記者向本埠進出口商之權威方面探悉、自滬戰後、一般較大投機商人、紛紛囤積歐美貨物、旋歐戰發生、彼等復以囤積美國貨物爲唯一可靠之</p>
<p>發財捷徑</p>
<p>詎美國境內、連日各項貨物、不論爲匹頭·橡皮·花紗·以及其他各種原料或製成品、均空前跌價、而美國股票、亦大事猛瀉、因此、一切美國物品、市價一致下跌、據本埠外商方面估計、上海有力投機商、截至前日（十七日）止、彼等所遭虧損之鉅、將達二千萬元至三千萬元之間、至少當在二千萬元以上、又因由於美貨之抑價、本埠所有其他貨物、無論其爲歐貨或其他外貨、甚至中國土貨、均受此影響而無一不</p>
<p>隨之下降</p>
<p>故上海凡以囤積物品投機者、不論大小、均已蒙慘重虧耗矣、此實本埠投機家、於此次黑匯猛烈回長中、又一意外的嚴重打擊、從事囤積者、當可憬悟、且上海兩租界內、所囤物品之多、實爲空前、不但海關倉庫爲之堆塞無空、雖經江海關迭次催　出貨、但終因銷路阻滯、無法出棧、而其他各銀行倉庫堆棧、亦無不滿坑滿谷、故目前一般投機商人、雖尙留連不欲虧本脫手、但終難維持、必益遭更大虧損、乃爲事理所必然、</p>
<h3>嚴防投機杜絕套匯　採用適當水準　顧全友邦商業繼續維持　基金充足法幣實力鞏固</h3>
<p>上海黑市匯價、自一日起猛縮之後、數日之間、縮勢甚勁、投機者乘機掀風作浪、無知老頗以爲慮、但一星期來、匯價轉而有放長之傾向足以證明此次緊縮、實爲計劃操作、決非法幣實力不充之表示、至於中國政府、爲顧全各友邦商業利益起見、仍不惜負擔巨大損失、繼續維持、但自操作技術而言、以前水凖未免失之過高、於是不得不令匯價冉縮而尋得適當水準、</p>
<p>友邦諒解</p>
<p>政府對穩定外匯維持幣信安定金融、早抱有最大之決心、惟爲防止上海之投機者活動起見、故金融機關對於放款採取愼重方針、提高一切利息、使投機者無利可圖、况某方不絕掉換法幣、套取外匯、高水準滙價之維持、適墮其術中、所以平準外匯基金委員會、採用適當水準、已得各友邦人士之諒解，所謂匯兌基金垂盡、此說絕無左證、實則基金餘額猶豐、爲數當達三四百萬鎊、</p>
<p>外滙充斥</p>
<p>自德軍侵入荷比後、荷比各國在華之金融機關、受其影響、信用頗呈動搖之象、各行爲應付存戶之提現起見、不得不處分其所有外匯、因之十一日上海匯市之變動、完全出於般意料之外、同時荷屬東印度因侵荷而不安、華僑之僑居該地者、爲預防可能的危險與嚴格滙兌管理計、多滙款回國以保安全、其中尤以流入上海者爲最多、此次匯款數額頗鉅、所以滙價之挺秀、自屬當然、</p>
<p>日趨穩定</p>
<p>中國對外貿易、經調整後、已趨好轉、據海關所報吿、今年第一季對外貿易、已出超二千一百三十九萬元、况歐戰醞釀重大變化、對外貿易、此後或有意外發展、所以此後可使匯市不假外力、自趨穩定、上海匯市、必將發現供過於求之現象、而使法幣滙價放長、並聞平準外滙基金委員曾、爲長期維持現在之水準、必要時得向市塲買進外滙、充實基金、使基金充足、幣信鞏固、</p>
<h3>周君常顧鵬程　昨晨突遭綁架　馳馬滬郊突遇綁匪　捕房正在偵緝營救</h3>

<h3>金融　外匯買氣銷沉</h3>
<p>外滙昨日市况、滙豐掛牌、悉無上落、英美匯暗市、爲狀較前寗靜、惟因意國參戰等不利買方消息、故扒戶銷聲匿跡、外行進胃、相形見絀勢吿步鬆、始終未有回頭、至買賣經過、晨初因匯兌重又猛縮、開盤美匯吿緊、但不久華投機商開始拋售、繼之日行出現貨、掉入遠期、美行賣意亦萌、力售現先令達二萬鎊、鬆價疊出、故迄午刻、英金現貨四便士一二五、頗易結得、結果英金叫便士一〇九三七五、美滙五元五三一二五較之前收英長〇七八一二五美則微硬〇六二五、期貨鬆勢、較現貨爲甚、故本月份期貨與現貨價父相接近、</p>
<p>日行仍出現貨</p>
<p>晨初以倫敦大條、近平遠跌三一二五、紐的銀價仍平、倫敦生金呆定、滙兌英對美不動、對滬長〇六二五、對法如前、美對英縮五分半、對滬長一角、對法小三分二五、中央掛牌各匯仍舊、銀行晨開現貨賣價、英金四便士〇三一二五、美滙五元三七五、較之上日晚收、英平美緊〇九三七五、乃滙兌猛落之故、開後於華商投機家吐塞中、市面頗形硬化、計華商投機家售予外行五月份美滙爲五尤三七五、匯豐掛牌揭曉·未有更動、白銀平衡稅揭曉亦無增减、此後趨勢仍鬆、因日行美行等均懷賣意、而外行吃胃依然不振、時現美匯日行出外行爲五元五六二五、惟日行曾扒遠期美滙計納入外行六月份價五元一二五與〇六二五、而某美行亦因貼進後、無巨額法幣、遂轉吐予滙豐曁麥加利現貨英金達二萬鎊、時已爲四便士一二五、迄至午收、絕少變化、結果英金四便士一〇九三七五美匯五元五三一二五、五月份英金四便士〇六二五、美匯五元四三七五、六月份英金三便士九〇六二五、美匯五元一八七五、較隔昨收市現貨英長〇七八一二五、美硬〇六二五、五六月期貨英各鬆一五六二五美亦各便一二五午後週六無市</p>
<p>香港美滙起伏</p>
<p>香港十八日（週六）電、今晨匯市開盤動盪不定、英匯現期貨均站原盤、美匯現貨緊五六二五、爲十九元八七五、（昨收爲二十元四三七五、申匯現貨降三元、爲三百六十二元、昨收爲三百六十五元）日滙現貨緊一元半、爲八十五元、十時正吿平、美匯現貨回鬆〇六二五、爲十九元九三七五、十時十五分穩定、美匯現貨續鬆〇六二五、爲二十元、申匯現貨續降二元、爲二百六十元、十時五十分穩定、美滙現貨續鬆〇六二五、爲二十元〇六二五、十一時三十分吿平、各滙槪無變動、下午週六無市、</p>

<h3>外幣賡續下趨</h3>
<p>昨日外幣市况、以紐的美股指數父猛跌六元、兼以德軍突破馬奇諾防錢、更因義將參戰之空氣迄米消失、凡此均足以助長賣氣、美金票始以鎊價回跌五分半、晨間曾略漲至十八元四角、但旋即步落、上午收盤後曾退至十七元六角、卒爲十七元七角半、比上日仍軋跌四角、英金票供給亦暢、市價甚軟、英美金鎊緊隨金價步落、香港票隨港滬匯兌趨低、法郞票及新加坡斐列濱等票、均趨軟弱、日金票忽又有供給、晚市浪爲二元一角四分、朝鮮票供求尙勻、晚市仍爲九角二分、</p>
<h3>貼現軋小三元</h3>
<p>昨滙劃票據貼現率、穩中略跌、每千元始終在一百十五元至一百廿元間、最後一百十二元、軋小三元、錢業公會拆息早午兩市均掛二角一分、計跌一分云、</p>
<h3>起仆範圍雖狹　金市仍不脫跌勢</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤市况、風浪稍平、起仆已漸見狹隘、奈利多利空消息、續在言人人殊之中、而外滙漫鬆、遂亦壓住不起、結果冉跌一百餘元、晨初於賣風中吿五千九百元開盤、加之銀號帮力賣、跌至五千八百五十元、惟稍隔片刻、證券帮錢兌業金號等聯袂搜購、曾抬辛五千九百五十元、卒因散戶乘機脫售、銀號見高拋空、霎時撳低至五千八百十元、全日低價、收盤前空戶活動抵補、重升至五千九百元、終受人心疲落影響、結果祇五千八百六十五元、較上日軋小一百〇五元、半天交易、時靜時旺、的有二千數百兩、銀樓飾金掛小十元、海關金等仍平、</p>
<p>烚赤再挫百元</p>
<p>自晨　條（十兩）、初以滙兌雖吿猛跌、但美匯緊後旋即回硬、且英滙美鬆、故人心疲弱、首由金號出銀號十兩、爲五千九百元、比上日做小七十元、嗣因某銀號傾向吐出、而一時缺乏買戶、頓又撳壓五十元、某銀號出銀樓帮及同業共三十兩、均爲五千八百五十元、旋某錢兌業忽來猛吸、爲數不少、加之斯時某證券帮吃胃亦健、而賣者已漸减少、不久回漲百元、錢兌業對做五十兩、爲五千九百五十元、奈滙市依然吿鬆、難免引起　高者吐出、未幾復盤小達五千九百元關、其時某銀號重起賣　、另一銀號帮亦跟踪拋空、再又跌落九十元、錢　業互做十兩、爲五千八百十元、後以賣風漸息、重見回升、且銀號帮及散戶等空頭紛紛抵補、價於賣戶缺少中、抬起數十元、銀號進金號等共六十兩爲五千九百元、將近收盤時買者轉少、再見向下、銀號出證券帮錢兌業等共六十兩、爲五千八百六十五元作午收價、結果比上日軋小一百〇五元、半天一百四十元上落、現金號之本牌金售出價、照烚赤較高十元、收進减低三十元、現標金照掛牌金低五十餘元、均鮮做開、</p>
<p>飾金掛小十元</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出、初時大同行仍懸六百十元、迨至十時三十五分掛小十元、此後無變化、結果大同行改懸六百元、新同行與上價相同、收進减低三十元光景、</p>
<h3>英印銀價回跌</h3>
<p>十七日倫敦電、大條銀市近平遠跌三一二五、大衆買進後知足、投機家售出遠期、市况平、收市後照掛牌有進者、賣戶觀望、又紐的電美銀價現貨均平、孟買電、印銀現期貨均已回小七安那、市况平、成交單共一百張云、</p>
<h3>紗花　棉紗浮多　尙未斬盡</h3>
<p>連朝狂上狂下之紗市、今則轉趨穩定、趨勢依然衰弱、實以昔日拉提太高、一旦反動、急性下挫、一般浮多、一時暫結不盡、所以虛風未息、市象仍向軟化之境推進、就此而論、暫時尙難肴升也、</p>
<p>現紗晨開人氣平平、市况和平、二十支雙馬現貨價爲一千三百三十五元、微漲至一千三百四十五元、旋聞多頭了結、外匯放長、而趨勢下落、跌至一千三百十元、少頃聞廣帮稍有需要、又漲至一千三白二十七元、但收盤以後、因外匯續鬆又下、査半日間成交統計一千六百零二包、十九日有紗一千六百九十件運香港、茲將各帮口買去之額量、分列如左、</p>
<p>香港五〇〇　同行　九九〇</p>

<h3>現棉交易停頓</h3>
<p>現棉交易完全入於婷頓之途、此因歐洲戰事愈陷紛亂之境、致人心高低不一、所以市面一無成交云、</p>
<p>另訊外棉市價、紐的棉市、晨初尙屬良好、續後終因人心悼惶、華爾街股票市價之大跌、影響物品價格殊巨、棉市收盤價格昨日又跌二十餘磅音、印度棉市市况穩定異常、較之上日尙漲八九羅比、但預測慘落十四羅比之巨、兩抵較之上日跌六羅比、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、日來市况之尖銳化、洋行方面交易反見大减、市上存底稀蒲、故滬上原棉之售價、且不受海外棉市之影響、一般意見、俱認運輸困難、將來之棉價、一致看漲云、此或係實情、茲將昨日棉市以美匯五元三七五折合美棉期貨送廠價如下、</p>
<p>二十支美米特林　三四一·八〇</p>
<p>二十支　又　下級二三二·一〇</p>

<h3>糧食　米市回小　麵粉平波</h3>
<p>米市結果、落半元至元許不等、早市開手、賣方尙思喊高、作客都呈觀望、轉呈軟勢、各貨價反見貶低半元、若一號陳西貢開五十元零五角、二號四十八元半、小絞四十七十元、價一跌、投機家忽又吸收、將小絞作皮球、小絞價霎又回至四十七元八角、不過其他西貢等貨、因無心思交易、而實銷不暢、未見動盪、依然平復、目如二號暹羅乏人問津、更覺疲頽、小絞亦難久持、一高即落頃刻各貨一致趨下、結果收盤各價小絞爲四十七元、二　西貢四十八元、四十七元五角、火紋四十九元四十八元半、較前貶短半元光景、而一號陳西貢、因遭國米疲跌影響計降元許、爲五十元、四十九元半、二號暹羅僅四十六元七角四十六元半、</p>
<p>洋米投機交易尙未絕跡、市價倐起倐落、仍有半元以上之出入、早市平疲、午市回振、下午復見平落、小絞早晨四十七元、開價漲至四十七元七八角、下午又自四十七元半開價降至四十七元、最後收價四十七元二角、西貢暹邏較少出入、結果均比前日疲小四五角及六七角不等、回籠英華司未有成交、甬帮及其他客帮均以今日星期未有問津云、</p>
<p>厚薄粳等國米、日來到貨旣旺續抵二三千包且以時届霉令米質易起變化、因之傳聞塲外暗盤、人心虛浮、懷貨者亟謀脫手、進貨者不敢多購、致做開寥寥、售價跌落一元有奇、無錫特淸粳五十一元至五十元、粉粳四十八九元，常崑粳自特別五十元左右、次至宿熱者祇四十六七元、靑泗薄稻四十八九元、次四十七元、南港早稻四十六七元、糯米到貨有限、惟銷塲因端節漸近、零躉俱旺、是以市面不受粳尖影響、獨見帶緊、行情提增半元、若金溧特元售四十四元出零、常丹貨亦須四十二三元耳、</p>
<p>粉現貨交易、更見淸淡、本街實銷、自內地粉傾銷以來、各廠零批、逐見减少、客銷前經一度活動、今又去化沉寂、故市淸淡異常、二號粉廠盤雖未更動、老車牌回籠貨十三元九角、尙乏受主、內地粉如順風山鹿等脾價祗十三元五角、亦無正式去化、統市除廠家批出叫千包外、其餘均在擯持中、又麵粉（十九日）有九千三百包、運往香港、</p>
<p>麥交易久靜、各地新麥已在收割時期、下月初旬當有新麥上市矣、</p>
<h3>證券　內債稍稍回漲　遠東股票俱跌</h3>
<p>證券暗盤、昨日市况由呆滯而稍稍轉堅、和平空氣及金庫券、均證明爲謠、昨日久豐始終補空、德孚做多、頗爲踴躍、聯和亦買進不少、同康鴻大鴻康以及六十四號或多或少、均有進胃、永康怡泰則早午均有賣出、協大聯益亦偏於拋賣、以買方較勇、形勢比較爲優、市價結果、除了種午後未能開出略小五分外、餘均同好一角半至三角、成交的七十餘萬元、茲列簡明表於後、</p>

<h3>雜糧　黃豆絕少上進</h3>

<h3>煤炭　煤球八元二角</h3>
<p>煤球行情、自日來先令回長以後、門莊價格、每擔已由九元四角頂盤、跌至八元四角、廠盤亦速跌兩次削低十八元行情、日昨因先令續鬆、經該公會議决、廠盤續跌四元、計開同業自車、每二百五十二元、送到另加車力、本街門莊、每籮二十元零五角、每擔八元二角云、</p>
<h3>疋頭　布銷獨盛</h3>
<p>國布　昨市跌勢漸形緩和、緣實銷及新囤戶均有落手購辦、惟以人心虛怯、大部份售盤仍明緊暗鬆、正式成交價格均低於市盤、甚形混亂、惟粗布實銷獨佳、價亦最堅定、英商綸昌廠各貨本週來訂價始終堅持、惟手貨已一致下落、昨廠盤獨娛樂花布跌三元、本街成交怡和粗布三百餘包、細布細斜一百餘包、溫甬台幫辦粗布斜紋色布色斜二百數十件、閩粤幫辦色布色斜一百餘件、</p>
<p>東布　昨市乍升乍降、略由疲而轉堅、晨開龍頭細布自四十四元降至四十三元、午盤復升至四十四元五角、後市人心頗好、開價售四十五元、旋以實銷仍呆、同業拋售、降至四十三元七角半收盤、較前日提漲七角半、而中檔雜牌細布始終迥旋於四十五六元之間、蓋聞本月份同業手貨尙多、未許樂觀、四君千嗶嘰收盤現出爲每碼一元二角五分半、本月份增至一元二角八分、亦回升三分、</p>
<p>出口　疋頭今（十九日）有十件、運往土樂、又八十件運往暹羅、</p>
<h3>巴勒呢暢銷</h3>
<p>昨星期六、呢絨市氣仍極緊張、巴勒呢、本客帮買方需要甚盛、條子素色皆見暢銷、因其新貨到埠缺乏、行悄愈形俏昂、昨英製頭號各色巴勒呢、每碼現批沽售三十二三元、二號貨售二十七八元、三號貨售二十一二元、東貨頭號售二十三四元、二號售十八九元、三號十五六元、上海紡織本廠貨一無出品、同業中均乏整批現貨、因之手貨居奮、不可一世、</p>
<h3>絲茶　浙繭開秤　到貨不多</h3>
<p>昨日絲市、日美均又吿跌、橫濱現貨小四十元遠期小三十四元、紐的近期跌八分半、遠期跌一角、目匯兌又不利出口業、故外銷更覺沉寂、英美行家近頗不安於業、甚鮮問津、</p>
<p>繭訊方面、浙屬硤斜一帶、昨已開秤、然因收成未佳、故到繭甚少、浙東陳繭、前日到滬達二千担左右、現上海絲廠開工雖寥寥無幾、但新陳繭子似無靑黃不接之象云、</p>
<h3>新繭上市聲中之　無錫蠶訊</h3>
<p>近年蠶絲業因外滙猛縮及美銷暢達、故營業旺盛、獲利空前、而今年情形、不减往年、故業中人對於經營方面、更形熱閙、本年度新繭登塲、迫在眉睫、茲將江浙產繭最著之無錫蠶事消息略誌一二、以供參考焉、</p>
<p>（一）蠶種選擇</p>
<p>育戶選擇蠶種最爲重要、上年育戶購買雜牌、而致收成减少、或中途病斃者、爲數不少、故本年春期羣相爭購老牌蠶種其中爲育戶歡迎者、首推滸墅關大有種塲之老虎牌、此牌種塲開出僅每張三元五角、而經販戶之操縱、一度漲至五元以上、雜牌種其價亦在二元左右、因農民之不信任、致有多處竟乏人問津、而遭虧蝕者、</p>
<p>（二）桑葉漲價</p>
<p>繭　隨絲價之上漲、故農人育蠶之興趣、較之往年、倍形濃厚、因往年常感不敷、故本年度之栽植桑苗者比比皆是、農家培植之施肥工作、亦較往年豐滿、惟因近年蠶量驟增、故葉片之供應、究屬不敷、於是供求背馳、葉價亦超出常情、漲風頓熾、北路一帶已至十三元左右、至南路方面每担竟至十五元以上、目下大幫已屆三眠、蠶體較前更形肥大、食量大增、近日桑價仍於小斷飛漲之中、</p>
<p>（三）各鄕蠶訊</p>
<p>西南路如方橘、板橋、周新鎮方泉·南橋·等處、係屬蠶戶之發原地、關於飼育方面以及應有設備、自較他處爲優、目下大幫已屆三眠、蠶身發育良佳、並無任何病象、如天氣煥濕均衡、預料結果可趨佳境、</p>
<p>至於北路方面如前洲·北七房·堰橋·陳墅·張繆舍等處傳來消息、此處自收蟻較他處稍遲、故大幫在二眠之中、少數已屆三眠、情形甚佳、衆以目下絲價折合繭價，的在二百五十元至三百元之譜云、</p>
<p>（四）繭行登記</p>
<p>目下新繭行將十市、無錫僞署召集同業、於八日開會議決、各項進行事宜、聞關於繭行登記、決於五月十二日起辦理登記手續、至本月二十日截止、如逾期小登記、而私自開行牧繭者、査明即當從嚴法辦云云、其實所謂登記手續、實即「華中公可」之操縱手段、（翔）</p>
<h3>糖市　粗白稍見回好</h3>
<p>昨糖市見平、粗白略有回好、車白僅二三角上落、公會劃盤、現貨二四粗白本棧貨七十二元至七十二元半、升一元、外棧新貨初爲七十一元五角至七角、後升至七十二元至二元一二角、井六七角、轉口貨五十八元至五十八元半、升元半、太車白新貨B嘜八十五元、升三角、東棧老貨以八十三元、成交三百包、XH嘜新貨八十三元二角、H嘜車赤六十三元、荷赤六十六元、本廠雪白仍回至七十二元半、本冰無更動、國糖因產價高昂、茲値洋糖見軟、號盤未肯不弱、擯持迄無續開、脚地甚堅云</p>
<h3>南北貨　紅黑棗續升</h3>
<p>紅黑棗邇來市勢步緊、續見上展、天津紅棗會開八十餘包、棗王六十五元、棗頭五十五元、頭戶四十五元、二戶乏貨高統手黑棗身份干燥開百餘包、價爲四十四元、府紅棗高貨二十八元、普通二十六元至廿四元、</p>
<h3>五金　貨價步落</h3>
<p>邇來外滙日見放長、各貨售盤均吿下跌、五金品行情當亦不能例外、唯各路銷胃依然未開、查昨市成交者僅二三百担而已、本街製罐廠·印刷廠·玩具廠·之會司鐵、建築帮之竹卽鋼條、本廠釘·新盤元·扎鐵絲·及水泥等、雖均略有採辦、惟爲數殊稀、致市况未見如何熱鬧、人心亦步趨鬆懈、如會司鐵每箱沽二百三十元、新盤元每担售六十八元、本釘七十七八元、黑鐵坯子一千二百元、馬口鐵二百六十元、均較前稍减、</p>

<h3>虎出於柙（二）</h3>

<h3>德侵荷比後美國的態度</h3>
<p>— 辛瓊</p>
<p>美國的注意仍集中於太平洋</p>
<p>道義上的努力</p>
<p>國際間的外交戰，在荷蘭若被德國侵入的假定下，已經進行了好久了，現在荷蘭的淪陷已經成爲事實，則外交戰中所預示的帶威嚇性的預言，能實施到怎樣稈度，自然很有關於米來的發展。此前美國是頗想用壓力制止德國的侵略荷蘭，因此一部份人竟致　測或會因此激而參戰，但這　形勢　到來，顯然還早，羅斯　在荷蘭　侵後的演詞，仍只　舟　外侵略，已對美國文明切實挑戰」那種道義的譴責，那末美國暫時的態度，大致仍只限於以道義爲武器。</p>
<p>對意國的壓力</p>
<p>自然美國所進行遏止德國擴張，也並不完全失敗。希特勒顯然曾預算意大利將在地中海發動以響應他在北海的發動，而意大利經美國的迭次勸吿，却不得不遲遲不發。我們固難說意大利會就此平靜下去，但英法頗恃此爲很大倚仗，美國在這方面的壓力，似很有點力量。這與美國是否將運用武力，並無關係，意大利是一個經濟資源最貧乏的國家，他的甘於受美牽制，當不外經濟上的原因。</p>
<p>對英法的態度</p>
<p>美國的暫時不會應用武力，在對於美洲勢力範圍內的丹，荷等國的屬地的措置方面，也可以看出。丹麥淪陷時，美國表示要保護冰島，而最後終於是央法軍在冰島登陸。荷蘭淪陷時，美國正要與南美各國磋商對於荷蘭在美屬地的處鉀方法，而英法軍也有在荷屬西印度登陸的傳說。我們很難說這是美國所願望的，只是美國旣尙無決定的辦法，遂姑憑英法如何罷了。</p>
<p>對遠東的態度</p>
<p>美國比較已決定態度的，却是對於荷屬東印度的關心。大批艦隊的集中太平洋龐大的擴軍　的提出，都顯見以太平洋方面的防務爲重。用威脅阻止日本的南進，固是顯著的目標，就對於　法，是吾有完全諒解，也很難說。英法的一時還禾實行保護荷印，一方面固然顧忌日本，別方面也等候着美國的決定。暫時，就憑荷印自稱防禦力堅强，再加上荷海軍的東開，增强荷印度的海防，以爲作緩衝形勢。可是這些辦法是在英法指揮下的，美國終必要擬出更有利於美國的計議來。</p>
<h3>岌岌可危　歐洲唯一中立國—瑞士</h3>
<p>— 拙</p>
<p>德軍侵犯荷·比·盧　中立國後，世界上僅有的中立國——　士，仍保持着原有　態，可是目下它也處在風雨飄搖之中；不久將來，它也許會捲入戰禍，遭受蹂躪的。現在關於這岌岌可危的小國情形，分誌於后：</p>
<p>國政</p>
<p>瑞士爲一聯邦共和國，由二十二州祖織而成。國家統治權大部操在村或區的公社手裏，再從這些公社產生縣政會，處理縣政（全國共二十五縣）。各縣行政會所派遣的上議院議員，和人民選出的下議院議員，　同選舉聯邦行政院委員，最後由這行政院內選出主席作爲　士共和國的總統；至於其最高聯邦政府所管轄的不過是外交政　·國有鐵路·郵務海　·造幣以及一部份軍事和敎</p>
<p>都市</p>
<p>首都是伯爾　，位跨亞爾河（Aar　R.）兩岸，風景極美，市况繁盛，手工業如絲織。雕刻寳石　有名；市內有萬國郵　聯合會及上下兩院，其他高山博物館。美術館。大學等，建築均極偉大富麗，人口十一萬。此外重要都市尙有交通中立地黎文，貿易總樞巴塞爾，避暑勝地洛桑，國際政治合作塲日內瓦，執世界牛耳的樂園之王——呂森，以及訂立名著於世之羅加諾保安公約的羅加諾。</p>
<p>交通</p>
<p>山嶺重疊，河流湍急，現代的交通運輸工具在瑞　亦相當發達，全國鐵道計長三千五百哩。山谷之問多設登山鐵道及高架索道。登山鐵道行駛着火車，大都是爲遊山的人們而設的；高架索道，遍佈各個山頭，縱橫交又，老遠望去好像蛛網一般，山鄉的人民往往應用着這些索道，輸送乾草·牛酪。白塔油之類。另外，瑞十交通工具上還有一種奇異的東西，就是雪撬，英文名「托波干」（Toboggans）專行駛在雪地上的，許多地方的郵差送信，學生上學，婦女上市，都是乘坐這雪撬的。</p>
<p>工商業</p>
<p>瑞士人民在百分之四十八以上都從事於工商業，所以除却英國及比利時外，在歐洲瑞士亦可稱爲工業最發達的國家了；最著名是冶金及織物業，其次便是名聞全球的鐘表業。父有許　農民，在他們農業的閑暇，常常去找手工業來做，因此如木　·象牙雕刻·編草·做花邊·紡蔴和織布之類在瑞士也很發達。</p>
<h3>德侵荷比的得失</h3>
<p>— 方企</p>
<p>滑鐵盧舊戰塲　又爲血戰之地</p>
<p>一星期以來的激變，幾已使人忘記德國的開始進攻荷，比，盧，三國，只是八天前的事。戰事消息的誇飾，斷碎，使得連以新聞爲第三大企業美國的新聞社也只有說「因戰區範圍之廣，及德軍之迅速攻入各地，以致無法立即準確估計戰區之範圍及雙方軍隊之實數」雖說如此，三國面積，荷一萬二千餘力哩，比一萬千方哩，盧一千方哩弱，合共不足二萬五千五百方哩。由荷蘭最北的格羅寗根到盧森堡最南的杜德爾根的長三百哩，由荷比德邊境的亞琛西北向海牙不足一百五十哩，西南向色當只一百餘哩。這一戰區，並不比中國豫鄂邊境唐河，信陽，鍾祥這三角區域爲大。德國在這區域內所用的兵力，大概只有三十萬至五十萬。</p>
<p>戰事的重心是在亞琛迤西地帶，德國首先所攻陷的重城是亞琛正西，荷蘭南部突入德比之間的稜堡區的瑪斯脫利希特，以後德國就以此爲中心發展。荷蘭最東北部實未經激烈爭奪而就淪於德國。這區域無退路，因而也無守法。盧森堡也很輕易地就被德國佔領，法國方面消息雖然說協約會開往盧國，只是空話，由摩塞爾河的流向就可以見到這是不利反攻的地帶，但冉南是法國軍事重鎮麥茨，所　德國也不再由盧向南。若是德國中路的進攻不很順利，則由盧森堡用重兵西侵自有必要，但德　旣突破亞爾培運河而包圍列日，法比已沒有由這路反攻的餘地，德國遂沿繆司河西南包圍亞登山地，而比國盧森堡省的兵隊只有撤往繆司河以西，德國於是可小勞而得亞登山地，並接着直趨色當，進攻法國。馬奇諾防綫延長綫已竟被突破，使全世界都注視於這歷史上著名的戰塲，可是就現在說，德國木意，也未必想就此　入，目前急需待解決的，還是另一著名歷史戰塲滑鐵盧或說不魯塞爾（比京）帶。協約國的援軍都集中在　一帶，德國不能在那方面制勝，就要在那方面失敗了。協約方面防止再蹈上次歐戰時的覆轍，是當然的，而德國似也米能改用另外的戰略。</p>
<p>上次歐戰，德國視對法重於對英，此次歐戰，則視對英重於對法，攻佔荷蘭，顯然爲對英而發，這自然與上次歐戰情勢不同了。然多一荷蘭作根據地，能加給央國以多大損害，却暫難加以估計。用空軍屈服一個國家，多少總還只是幻想，德國說侵佔荷蘭，是爲防止英法假道荷蘭，倒並不僅是藉口。這點實是德國所恐懼的，但英國却似縱然有此計畫，也並不預備實行，牠　挑怒德國，使破壞別國的中立，牠就正好借口防制德國，而　留，管　中國的船隻，以增加牠的封鎖效力。全世界的船舶計有六千八百萬噸，大部份分屬於九大航業國，現在英法再操縱了，　，荷，丹，比的船船，已超過噸數的一半，加上相助的美國，减去船舶小能活動的德國，則　法所橾縱的過三分之一。如封鎖眞可以致勝，德國倒也不免自斷出路。荷蘭淪陷，而英國偏持鎭靜，或者正自以爲得　，可是一旦英國明白封鎖的效力，有限制，到現在英國　是遭到一個　重的打擊。</p>
<h3>墨索里尼</h3>
<h3>希特勒</h3>
<h3>盧森堡大公國</h3>
<p>— 密騰</p>
<p>人公國這一名稱，就顯出盧森堡是一個封建殘餘。拿破崙盛時屬法，以後加入德意志聯邦，但普奧戰起時沒有附和普魯士，因而戰後（一八六七）牠附庸於尼德蘭，繼幷成爲獨立國。這時德國非但沒有預料到以後萊因區的實業化，而且沒有料到將造成德意志帝國。所以對這蕞爾之地，幷不怎樣重視，普法戰後，（一八七〇）普旣得亞爾隡斯洛林，盧森堡已三面受德國句圍，而依然能維持獨立，只是僥悻。一九一四至一八年歐戰，如結果不是德方失敗，盧森堡的獨立，是必然終結的。這次再爲德佔，也似非德國戰敗不能恢復，所以女人公只有向法國奔避。</p>

<h3>陳栩園先生紀念號　悼陳栩園先生</h3>
<p>— 神禹</p>
<p>當國中禾有家庭工業社以前，栩園先生爲東南有數之文學家，旣有家庭工業社，栩園先生爲全國知名之實業家。此先生畢生歷史中劃然可分之兩大時期也。先生之手創家庭工業社，其經營慘淡之述，凡稍知先生生平者類能言之，同文中周子瘦鵑及謝子啼紅紀之尤詳，余可無贅焉。獨念先生以小工業託始，而成就之偉，蔚然列於上海大實業之林，要非可以倖致者，世人徒知先生以無敵牌擦面牙粉爲奠定具事業之基，殊不知先生當時以牙粉爲首先之出品者，其用意深遠，不徒逐什一之利而已。厥後繼無敵牌牙粉以問世之出品，殆莫不以舶品爲之對象，此尤可窺見其苦心焉。先生木此苦心，持以堅毅之精神，運以神敏之幹略，積健爲雄，底於光大，遂使國貨事業成一堅强之壁壘，而國人漸摩於先生之化，亦紛起致力於國貨之生產，所謂先覺覺後覺，先生其庶幾有之。自世之衰，人每詬病書生爲無用，今先生亦書生也，而建樹卓然如此，亦可以稍雪書生之恥矣。余之識先生，蓋遠在二十年以前，實先生之老友劉丈立人爲之介，嘗數共遊讌，時家庭工業社方發軔，先生每樂道研究化學之心得，娓娓不倦，精辟每出人意表，迨後光生以家庭工業社業務之日擴，諸事叢於一身，而余亦以病懶，遂絕過從。去歲先生自滇歸，屢思往訪而未果，及先生臥病，以至作古，余事先皆未之聞，大殮之日，余聞訊已晚，又未及臨哭，可謂負先生甚矣。今附錄挽先生七古一篇，雖不足盡先生生平於萬一，亦聊以見當日往還之跡云。</p>
<p>先生詞賦相如流，才名蚤歲傾九洲，鄕人隨園亦頗似，捷才下筆風颼颼，千言日試付鉛槧，當時萬紙馳星郵。丈夫讚書貴有用，章句死守非吾儔，惟公淹博貫今古，晚從形下窮鑽求，有仇切齒寄深意，能於物用開新猷，瓊霏玉屑播萬口，昔賢漱石功應恈，世衰戶絕鳴機響，里巷玩惰誰能修。先生作計勸媮俗，考工一室貽良謀，鴟夷　陶不專美，君子開物羣生稠，書生無用世久病，誦說仁義飢難瘳，漢高雖死駡未絕，公起十洗儒冠羞。吁嗟書生豈無用，古今萬事宗軻邱，文章畢業本一貫，公所成就良有繇。昔從劉丈（立人）與公識，忘年晋接情何優，長身嶽嶽若松峙，淸言屢　淸尊酬，別來歲自苦飄忽，廿年夢繞元龍樓，自經喪亂各流散，公亦遠作川滇遊，天南去歲賦歸棹，山川歷歷奚囊收，滄桑棖意未已，騰看黯黯江雲浮。嗟余拙懶關問訊，坐愧舊日江邊鷗，河淸指顧公不俟，乍聞急淚欑雙眸，蓋棺况復欠一訣，負公至此眞吾尤。念公精神有不死，豈惟詩卷人間留，二難繼起並殊絕，元方談藝尤賅周，峨峨門德照時俗，江湖豪氣存千秋，聞公西湖有生擴，梅花掩映依松秋，只今烽火阻歸骨，靑山有恨何時沐。</p>

<h3>你往那裏去　（一）</h3>
<p>「引到永生，那門是窄的，路是小的，找着的人也少。」每年暑假從大中學畢業出來的學生，無慮千萬，當他們從校長手中領得文憑回到座上的時候，他們的朋友，有句關心到他們前途的話，要提出來問他們，就是說，「你往那裏吾？」他們的人數既然這樣衆多，所走的路徑，當然各不相同；有的往成功之路邁進，有的向失敗之途而行，有的走生命之路，有的到死亡之道。某君說，「有一條路，似乎不差，但到頭來，却是死路，」又說，「義人之路，有如黎明之曙光，逐漸開朗，以至于完全明亮。」罪人的路，逐步艱難，善人的路，日見發展。耶穌當日在世曾以他明慧的眼光向世人宣稱，世上有兩條路；一條寬而易行。引到滅亡。走的人多；一條窄而難行，引到永生，找到的人却少。敎育許使我們適于做一種的工作，但當我們手　文憑前去找時，又許無工作可得。蓋以適當工作的找得，機會的有無，頗有關係。不過靑年人要立志做人，這個權柄却操在他自己，不必偕重機會。所以我們不要單看這機會之門當閉的紛亂世界，我們要向內看，向上看，果敢的做個如何的人，我們有了這樣的決心，我們這內心的世界，遲早要影響到這外面的世界。因為一個人的成敗，有賴于內在的靈力，比有賴于其所從事的工作還多。（待續）</p>

<h3>在物價飛漲聲中我們應該怎樣？</h3>
<p>— 文</p>
<p>小朋友們，在這米珠薪桂物價飛漲的時候，父母整天的愁着柴米，我們是否還是做個不懂事的孩子，伸着手要錢，胡亂的買些零食吃，或者一會兒要買點鉛筆要買簿子，使父母加重負擔，不，我們要做圖個識時務的兒童，我們雖然不能分任父母的經濟，可是我們也該盡力節省，减輕父母的　負。以下幾杵事是我們在這時候應該做的，而是最普通且做得到的。</p>
<p>一，努力求學：小朋友們！我們來計算一下，每一學期的學費是多少，我想普通一個小學生，每一年的上學費用，大概在五六十元左有，家中姊殊兄弟多的，一筆教育費用是很可觀的了。父母在極困苦生活中積衣縮食的栽培我們，如果還不肯刻苦自勵，等到學明終結時，成績不合格而不能升級，或因此停學，那時懊悔已來不及了。</p>
<p>二，愛護衣着及用品：小朋友的衣着及用品最耗費，一件衣服穿不到幾天就弄破了，一雙新鞋不到一星期已穿破了，一本新書不到一個月破碎得不成樣子，其他如鉛筆橡皮簿子等的浪費，不能一一提出。總之，兒童的一切用品比成人耗費得多，是什麼原因呢？第一兒童不知來處之困難，第二是不會適當的應用，如一枝新的毛筆，在用以前和用後不用清水洗凈，在用時被墨汁膠住，放在嘴裏咬，筆毛咬斷脫落，就不能再寫。現在一枝毛筆鉛筆的價格也漲了幾倍，如果再不肯愛惜的當心的用着，把一枝鉛筆當幾枝用，一件衣服當兩件穿，以後恐無力購買了。</p>
<p>三，鍜鍊和保護身體：醫藥費的激增，也不是普通一般家庭所能擔負的，所以我們對於自己的身體要加以鍜鍊和保護。（一）鍜鍊方面：因為環境關係，沒有廣大的場地供給我們運動，可以乘着清早人少，空氣淸鮮的時候，在天井裏露臺上舉行早操。並且養成步行習慣，因步行可帮助消化，促進血液運動，是很好的全身運動。（二）保護方面：要按時進食，選擇有營養的食物，如青菜豆腐之類，不吃領事。在夏天要打各種防疫針，以防疾病傳染。三，：盡量利用廢物：我們在路上時常看見拾垃圾的孩子，在垃圾箱中尋出破布碎玻璃等這些又髒又破的東西，拿去整理改造，又成實用美麗的用品來買給我們。所以我們需要什麼用具，或什麼玩具，在　中盡量收集用不到的廢物，創造或摹做，儘我們的力做去，有時一錢不化可以得到我們所希望的東西。</p>
<h3>一個化學故事</h3>
<p>— 朱凱慶</p>
<p>小朋友：現在我來報吿你們一件有趣的事情，這是從陝西我的朋友那裏通信吿訴我的。</p>
<p>我的朋友，住在陝西西安，他來信說：「……有一次，我偕同着我的姊姊，妹妹們去遊，唐代傳至今的名勝古蹟—華淸池——在那面有溫泉噴湧、（當地人有時取來洗浴，因為溫泉內含有硫磺，可醫治皮膚病；如：疥瘡，廯濕症等，這就所謂礦泉浴）。當我們走到那裏，正在看到得意與濃的時候；忽然我抬頭看見姊姊和妹妹們的臉上，搽着的白粉都變了一層黑灰。我當時感覺很是奇怪，……」。我自得着了這個消息，亦是非常的好奇，一時想不出理由。就跑去詢問化學敎師，他回答說：「因為普通次等的粉內，都含有鹼性碳酸鉛，（俗稱鉛白），又溫泉中因含有硫礦，當晴天時，受太傷的曬射蒸發而成蒸氣的硫化氫，騰散空中，硫化氫遇到鉛白，就起化學變化而變成黑色。伊們一定是搽的次等粉，所以會發生這樣的情形。並且次等粉內因含有鉛質，是有毒性的，不宜搽用」。我頓時明白了這個問題。小朋友，你們一定愛美而喜歡搽粉吧！但是，據我的先生說，普通次等粉含鉛質而有毒性，不宜搽用；那麼買高尚些的粉，價錢又太貴；尤其在現時物價飛漲的當兒。所以我勸你們，倒不如將搽粉用的金錢，積省和儲蓄起來。</p>
<h3>切不要將馬路當作遊戲場！</h3>
<p>— 新良</p>
<p>小朋友們，你們在學校里讀完了書之後，是不是即刻回家的？還是，喜歡約集了三四個同學一起到馬路邊，或者里弄底里去玩要的？我想，在事贊上，這種專門高興在馬路上『打菱角』，『造房子』的小同學，一定很多很多。</p>
<p>在這里，就讓我來報吿一個事實給諸位聽聽吧。住在我家隔壁的王兒，因為在馬路上與兩個同學一塊兒打菱角的緣故，一輛汽車從遠處駛來，他竟沒有留意到，等到他的注意力才從菱角上移到『哆…哆…』的汽車喇叭聲上來的時候，他原想立刻避開，可是已經來不及啦，頓時那輛載得重重的汽車直向他身邊衝來，他只能跌倒在地上，讓那輛車子在他手臂上滾過，這可憐的王兒，至今還在醫院裏治療，他父母對於他已花了發百元錢，在他自已呢，失去了一隻可寶貴的手臂，並且，還荒廢了許多的功課！之外，還得要在醫院里吃苦。</p>
<p>『馬路似虎口！』這句話是一些兒不差的！馬路上很危險，我們每一位小朋友都不應該當它作遊戲塲用。你們即便是在課餘想作些消遣，那末，也應該在校園裏，或者乒乓室裏跳跳玩玩，拍拍乒乓，馬路上是無論如何不可以玩的！</p>
<h3>秀蘭鄧波兒自傳　（三）</h3>
<p>— 民</p>
<p>但是我即使有空閒的時候，也不想到那常去的河灘上去玩，一位內圍繞在我四周的人，委實太多了，使人難受得什麼似的。記得有一年的夏季，我們到白爾巴去——那是離綠杉磯不遠的一個海灘。那時爸也的銀行中恰好放假，我們就在這裏盤桓了兩禮拜。我和一般小孩子們在沙上玩，大家玩得怪有趣的。我將我的名兒秀蘭告知他們，他們也各自把名兒告知我。有一天早上，却有一位太太站在我的面前，放聲說道：「哎喲：你的模樣兒活像是秀蘭鄧波兒啊！」</p>
<p>我想這件事倒很好玩，因此帶着笑對那太太說道：﹁是啊，這正是我—秀蘭鄧波兒。﹂那太太將信將疑的呆住了一二分鐘，就走將過來，對我從頭至腳仔仔細細地看了又看。接着伊又瞧見了我的爸爸和媽媽正立在近旁，一時興奮得說不出話來。末了伊從手袋裏掏出一本小冊子來，要求他們倆容許我替伊簽一個名。媽媽答尤了，喚我過去，我正在很高興的和小朋友們挖掘一條沙的隧道，一聽得媽媽的呼喚，即忙住了手，趕過去把我的名兒簽在那太太的小冊子上。那時節我簡直還不會寫字，所以簽個名兒也簽不好；單是簽上「愛—秀蘭鄧波兒這幾個字，就費了好一會工夫。那太太瞧我寫完之後，感激得很，向我謝了又謝，並且說伊有一位姪女兒住在東部，正和我一般大小，要是知值了伊曾和眞的秀蘭鄧波兒講過話，一定很快樂的。</p>
<p>我等伊走開了，才又回過去挖掘隧道；不料不多一會，就有許多人紛紛的趕來了。有的只是在我身旁走過，對我瞧上幾眼，有的却嚷着道：「哈羅，秀蘭！」我也回答了一聲「哈羅，」其實我很想向他們說：「請你們不要來打擾我，不見我正在忙着挖掘一條隧道嗎？」但他們早已拿出鉛筆和小冊子來，彎着腰來央求我給他們簽個名兒。我正在沒法擺佈的時候，幸而媽媽趕上來了，柔聲下氣的對他們說今天不能再簽名了；因為每天規定午睡的時間已到，急急要回去了。於是我們一同回到了旅館裏，其實我午睡時間還沒有到，不過媽媽借此使我脫身罷了。爸爸把我抱在膝蓋上，說道：「親愛的，這就為了你已經出名的緣故。當下他從一本書中讀了一節故事給我聲。我不住的望着窗外，心想我倘能在沙灘多玩一會，把隧道挖掘成功，那才有趣哩。</p>
<p>我在很小的時節，住在　他馬尼加，媽媽和爸爸慣常帶了我的小桌子和小椅子到海灘上去。可甘，你可能精到這是什麼緣故？我來和你說，原來我是慣常在太陽光下，坐在我自已的小桌子上用午餐的。媽媽把一個挺大的保暖瓶，裝了湯，或麥糊，或菜蔬給我吃，都是熱熱的。伊說伊總想給我在一定的時間用餐，即使離開了家，也不致錯過。你可知道我最初拍電影的時候，（那時我還只三歲半）媽媽也慣常帶着這保暖瓶上攝影塲的嗎，旁的婦人們，有時要笑我媽媽，未免太留心我的吃食了；然而伊却不管，老是要隨身帶着這瓶子，並且說：「不管攝影塲不攝影塲，我的寶貝是應富吃得好好的。」</p>

<h3>獻給移風社的管見</h3>
<p>— 唯我</p>
<p>卡爾登的移風社，最近有梁次由李文濬馬金鳳王仲平王仲英曹慕髡等六人脫離的消息。此六人之脫雕，影響移風社的演出頗大。麒麟童是唱鬚生的，鬚生戲最要緊的是小花臉，（和旦角戲最要緊的是小生一樣）尤其是專演新戲的卡爾登，小丑更佔重要。這次脫離移風社的六個人中，却有三個是唱小花臉的。</p>
<p>以前麒麟童有兩個寸步不離的小花臉：一個是周五寳，一個是劉斌崑。這兩個人，都是江南數一數二的丑角人才，過去麒麟童的成就，實得力於兩個小花臉不少。自從移風社出演卡爾登，周五寳因病脫離，小花臉的陣綫是劉斌崑，李瀚三，梁次山，王仲英，曹慕髠，其中李瀚三的包銀比梁王曹三人大。但其藝則一無可取。梁次山，王仲英這兩個後起人物。倒還不錯。所以少一周五寳，對於麒麟童的演戲，尙無多大問題。後來不幸劉斌崑又脫離了，給予移風社一個重大的打擊。同時移風社方面，也知道李瀚三之難撑大局，於是又邀得朱百歲加入，聊以過渡。但米幾朱白歲又應邀外埠而他去，這樣就造成梁次山的地位，雖然李瀚三的包銀比梁次山大，但是台下人都歡迎次山而不歡迎瀚三，於是移風社對次山乃相當倚重。現在次山一旦脫離，還帶上王仲英曹慕髡，頓時移風社的四個基本小丑，祗剩李瀚三一人，其影響移風社如何，可想而知。</p>
<p>現在聽說移風社已邀得塡坑之人，一個叫曹惠霖，一個叫沈之賢，曹惠霖是老伶工曹甫臣的兒子，原習凈兼工丑，歷在小型劇塲充班底，其藝似不及梁次山；沈之賢與王仲央地位相同，藝術相同，替代頗恰當。我以愛護麒藝之深，願貢獻一點意見現在梁次山之缺，尙未補就，應速邀一相當人物，最好能向大舞台商借焦寳奎，或者商借共舞台的秦鎖貴，他也是麟麟童的老搭擋，藝頗可取。而且共舞台的小花臉很多，不妨一借他由之石。如果移風社方面不願向他班借人的話，那末不如重邀朱百歲加入，駕輕就熟，可聊勝於無也</p>

<h3>Victory at Zao Yang, Chinese Army Pursues and Defeats Japanese Troops - Continuing to Recover Tai Ping Lake River Area - High-Ranking Japanese Commanders at Ji Tai Ping Annihilated - Counterattacking Japanese Regiment at Zao Yang Encircled at Hu Yang</h3>
<p>Fan City: Japanese troops besieged on the eastern, southern, and northern sides of Zao Yang by Chinese forces, their retreat routes completely cut off, struggled desperately. They regrouped their defeated forces to counterattack the Chinese. Fierce back-and-forth fighting and hand-to-hand combat erupted, leading to unprecedentedly intense street battles in Zao Yang City. A Japanese regiment counterattacking north of Zao Yang was largely encircled by Chinese forces at Hu Yang. Despite putting up a desperate resistance, their high command headquarters at Tai Ping Town had been captured by the Chinese, and high-ranking commanders were annihilated. Japanese troops retreating to Cao Dian were also wiped out by the Chinese, and the Japanese forces trapped at Hu Yang were on the verge of collapse. Over 400 fleeing Japanese vehicles, including supply trucks and over 200 tanks, along the Xiang Hua Road, were unable to retreat as the area east of Tang County Town was entirely cut off by Chinese forces. They retreated into the Da Hong Mountains, where they were intercepted and attacked by the Chinese, suffering over half casualties. Four to five thousand Japanese troops retreating southwest towards Huang Long Dang and Yu Shan are being encircled for annihilation. (18th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Fan City: Over two thousand Japanese soldiers retreating from Zao Yang, finding their passage blocked by the tight Chinese lines at Ma Jia Ji and Yang Jia Peng, took advantage of the Chinese army's westward advance to retreat into the main peak of the Da Hong Mountains, Chang Gang Dian. Chinese forces immediately pursued them to Wang Hu Shan, intercepting and attacking them. From the morning of the 14th to noon on the 15th, the Japanese suffered over half casualties. Another group entered Zhang Jia Ji, gradually gathering over four thousand troops with ten artillery pieces, constructing fortifications for defense and burning civilian houses indiscriminately. However, the Chinese forces, with a resolute determination to die for the cause, launched fierce attacks, battling fiercely for two days and nights, killing five to six hundred Japanese soldiers. On the night of the 16th, the Chinese launched an even more ferocious attack, recapturing Zhong Mai Zhai near Zhang Jia Ji. Another Chinese unit flanked their rear from the side of Zhu Lin Gang. As wind and rain poured down and Japanese planes provided constant support, the Chinese army gradually approached, bravely besieging them. The Japanese forces, unable to withstand the pressure, retreated in disarray towards Yang Jia Dian, leaving behind over a thousand corpses. Sixteen Japanese soldiers were captured alive, along with hundreds of mules, horses, and abundant military supplies. (18th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Fan City: Chinese sweeping forces on the border of Yu and E provinces captured Qi Fang Gang on the afternoon of the 16th, killing many Japanese soldiers and seizing a large amount of supplies and ammunition. The remaining Japanese soldiers retreated southeast. Another unit recovered Yang Jia Dang, killing over nine hundred Japanese soldiers. Another unit occupied Hu He, killing over two hundred Japanese soldiers, and capturing four heavy machine guns and over one hundred and fifty rifles. (18th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Fan City: Over a thousand Japanese soldiers retreating from Zao Yang gathered at Xin Ji. On the night of the 14th, the Chinese army took advantage of their disarray to launch a fierce attack, killing over two hundred Japanese soldiers and capturing abundant military supplies. The remaining Japanese soldiers retreated towards Shuang He, and the Chinese are in pursuit. (18th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Fan City: Chinese forces reached Yan Dun Dian, west of An Lu, on the night of the 14th, crossing the Yun River and besieging the county seat of An Lu. (17th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Fan City: Since the Chinese forces in Hubei advanced eastward along the Han Yi Road, their progress has been rapid, and their victories have been numerous. On the 14th, they defeated the Japanese who were blocking their advance from Yan Men Kou and Zao Shi. On the afternoon of the 15th, they crossed the Jing Zao Road and engaged in a fierce eight-hour battle from dawn to dusk with Japanese forces coming to meet them at Tang Chi and Jiu Li Gang. Subsequently, the Japanese reinforced with six to seven hundred troops, eight tanks, four artillery pieces, and over ten planes from Ying Cheng and Jing Shan, all of which were repelled by the Chinese, killing over four hundred Japanese soldiers. Including Captain Yano from the Dike unit, who is still engaged in fierce fighting with over six hundred Japanese soldiers at Zhou Jia Wo and Dao Gu Dian. (18th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>He Yingqin Receives Reporters, Reviews the Northern Hubei Campaign - Sun Lianzhong's Troops Were the First to Enter Zao Yang - Japanese Losses Far Exceed Those in the Northern Hunan Campaign</h3>
<p>Chongqing: General He Yingqin, Minister of Military Administration and Chief of Staff, met with reporters this morning to review the Northern Hubei Campaign. He stated that in early April, the Japanese army began preparations to invade Xiangfan, transferring its 33rd Division from Northern Jiangxi to Eastern Hubei to replace the 39th Division gathered in Sui County. Its 40th Division was transferred to the northwest of Xinyang, and then the 33rd Division was transferred from Eastern Hubei to the Ping Han Road in Xinyang. The 3rd Division, previously stationed on the Ping Han Road, gathered at Changtai Pass (north of Xinyang). The 6th Heavy Artillery Brigade was transferred from Hankou to Xinyang. The 13th Division and the 20th Mixed Brigade gathered at Zhongxiang. In addition, the Japanese side also gathered two artillery brigades, two tank regiments, and two poison gas units to invade, aiming to take Xiangfan and Nanyang with their main force. The right flank or northern route would launch an offensive west of the Da Hong Mountains, attempting to break through the Chinese army's positions and attack Nanyang, then turn south to assist the Japanese forces attacking from Sui County and Zhongxiang, completing the encirclement of the Chinese forces in the Zao Yang area. However, the Chinese forces moved their positions north of the Tang River. Once the Japanese army reached the Tang River, the main force of the Chinese army immediately advanced south. The Chinese forces in the Da Hong Mountains firmly defended their positions, launching fierce attacks on the rear and flanks of the Japanese army as they advanced from Sui County and Zhongxiang to invade the Zao Yang area. The Chinese army was now in a position to encircle the Japanese army. After recapturing Zao Yang on the 16th of this month, they continued to attack the remaining Japanese soldiers in the suburbs of Xinglong Ji and Wu Jia Dian in the southeastern area of Zao Yang, cutting off their retreat routes. The fighting is still ongoing. Although the battle has not yet ended, the victory of the Chinese army is assured. The Japanese army's goal of seizing the three cities of Xiangyang, Fancheng, and Nanyang, and annihilating the defending forces of Zao Yang, has been thwarted by the Chinese army. The Japanese army, which originally planned to encircle the Chinese army, is now instead trapped in the Chinese army's encirclement. The number of Japanese casualties and the loss of war materiel in this battle must be extremely high. Because the fighting is still ongoing, it is impossible to obtain the details, but it can be inferred that it will far exceed the Japanese army's defeat near Changsha in the Northern Hunan Campaign. It is now known that the Chinese forces that first entered Zao Yang were the troops of General Sun Lianzhong, who defended Tai Er Zhuang in the past. Mr. He did not believe that the Japanese army could now gather a large number of reinforcements to Northern Hubei to launch another offensive, and said, "Perhaps they can still gather two brigades as reinforcements." Mr. He emphasized the importance of the Northern Hubei Campaign, saying that the victory of the Chinese army has dealt a serious blow to the Nanjing puppet regime, and made it clear that the combat power of the Chinese army is now growing stronger day by day. Mr. He then answered questions, saying that there are currently 35 Japanese divisions in China. Due to casualties and diseases, each division needs to be replenished with 1,500 soldiers per month. Based on this calculation, regardless of this major battle, Japan must send 40,000 to 50,000 soldiers to China every month to maintain its strength. In the summer months, the number of Japanese soldiers who die from illness will inevitably be more than usual, especially in the Guangxi region, where Japanese troops have been stationed for a long time and have often been attacked by diseases and withdrawn. This can be verified by historical records. Mr. He concluded by saying that the Chinese army's mobile artillery units along the south bank of the Yangtze River have been very active recently. To avoid being bombed, Japanese ships mostly sail at night. (Reuters, 18th)</p>
<h3>Film of the Yu E Campaign Soon to Be Shipped to Chongqing</h3>

<h3>Since the Start of the Sino-Japanese War, Chinese Post Offices Have Suffered Losses of 35 Million Yuan - 151 Postal Workers Have Died</h3>
<p>Chongqing: According to the Ministry of Communications, from the start of the Sino-Japanese War to the end of June last year, Chinese post offices suffered losses of over 35 million yuan, including 29,000,000 yuan in lost revenue, 3,800,000 yuan in stolen and burned postage stamps, 690,000 yuan in damage to 49 post offices, 430,000 yuan in equipment losses, 142,000 yuan in losses of 300 postal trucks, and 1,900,000 yuan in evacuation of employees from war zones. Postal workers are under orders to remain on duty until the last minute, so their casualties are higher than any other civilian sector of the government. As of the end of June last year, a total of 151 postal workers had died from Japanese bombs, artillery fire, gunfire, or bayonets. (Reuters, 18th)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>On Japan's Future, from the Perspective of the Northern Hubei Battle</h3>
<p>Beginning in early this month, the Japanese army's seven divisions in the Hubei-Henan border area launched a new offensive westward from Xinyang in Southern Henan and Suixian and Zhongxiang in Northern Hubei. Their goals were likely: (1) to seize the Tongbai Mountain area, a base of the Chinese army; (2) to occupy Xiangfan; (3) if both of the above were achieved, then the Japanese army's position in the Wuhan area could be consolidated, because Xiangfan and Tongbai are strategically located in a controlling position. However, after ten days of fierce fighting, due to the strong resistance of the Chinese army on the front lines and the multi-faceted attacks of the Chinese army on both flanks and rear, the Japanese army's westward offensive ended in complete failure and disorderly retreat. The Chinese army successively captured key locations such as Shuang Gou, Tang County Town, and Changtai Pass, and is now carrying out pursuit operations to encircle and annihilate the remaining Japanese troops. On the 16th, they recovered Zao Yang. Zao Yang is located between the Tongbai and Dahong Mountains and is the gateway to Xiangfan and a major town in Northern Hubei. The fact that the Chinese army was able to recapture it in one fell swoop demonstrates their bravery. Even the Chief of Staff of the Japanese army in China, Itagaki, personally flew to the front line to command, but was unable to reverse the decline. This disastrous defeat of the Japanese army can be considered a complete rout.</p>
<p>If we further observe, it is not difficult to understand that this Japanese army's disastrous defeat in the Hubei-Henan border area is of very significant importance: this is not only a failure of the Japanese army in a corner of Northern Hubei, but also a failure of Japan's basic strategy; it is not only a temporary failure, but also the prelude to an ultimate failure. Originally, Japan's basic strategic principle for the war against China was to swallow the entire China and dominate the Far East. The slogans that Japan loudly proclaimed, whether it was the political "construction of a new order in East Asia", the economic "Japan-Manchuria-China as one", or even the military "close cooperation and joint anti-communism", all served to support this strategic principle of "swallowing the entire China and dominating the Far East". However, because of China's heroic resistance and prolonged resistance, it became impossible for Japan to swallow China in one gulp. Therefore, after Nishio and Itagaki came to China last year, they slightly modified their strategic principle to conduct a "thorough mopping-up of surfaces" in North China, a "linear occupation" in Central China, and a "firm defense of points" in South China. They originally intended to wait until North China was thoroughly "mopped up" before destroying Central China, and after Central China was destroyed, to destroy South China. The above is the basic strategic principle of the Japanese army's invasion of China. As for its specific strategic means, after summarizing and observing, there are no more than four items, namely: (1) fully exploit the advantages of its mechanized equipment, move quickly, and strike first; (2) probe for the weaknesses of the Chinese army on the front lines and implement a central breakthrough; (3) seek shortcuts that can be used on the flanks and implement flanking attacks; (4) make efforts to lure the main force of the Chinese army in order to achieve the goal of a quick war and a quick decision. These four strategic means are almost always used by the Japanese side in every battle.</p>
<p>But time is Japan's great enemy. As the time of the war extends, the objective situation is also changing. Japan's strategic principles and strategic means have to be limited by the new operational environment and constrained by the new international situation, so that its future is becoming increasingly bleak and it is approaching decline. As far as the new operational environment is concerned, the object of the Japanese army's operation, that is, China, its political unity and consolidation, the leapfrog development of construction, the simultaneous improvement of the quality and quantity of the new army, and the calmness and strength of the popular sentiment, are becoming more and more successful after experiencing hardships. All of this was something that the Japanese warlords did not anticipate at the beginning, so that the Japanese warlords' conspiracy to defeat North China, Central China, and South China one by one became impossible, and they had to fight against the entire China, and had to fight against the entire China. In this way, the Japanese army's basic strategic principle of "thorough mopping-up of surfaces in North China, linear occupation in Central China, and firm defense of points in South China" had to be reduced to fantasy. Secondly, on the Japanese side itself, its available manpower, generously estimated, is more than four million people. In addition to the 1.5 million people who have been killed or wounded, there are currently 2 million people fighting and stationed in China. The state of strain of insufficient allocation has long been revealed. Even if the remaining hundreds of thousands or even more than one million people are transferred to China, it is unlikely to improve the current situation. What's more, since the July 7th Incident, Japan's military expenditure for the invasion of China has reached 23,270,000,000 yen, its public debt issuance has exceeded 20,000,000,000 yen, and last year Japan's foreign trade (excluding the so-called "yen bloc") also had an excess of imports of 405,426,000 yen. How can Japan bear these astronomical figures for a long time! In addition, the terrain of China is flat in the east and mountainous in the west. Since the main battlefield has moved westward into the hilly and mountainous areas, the Japanese army's mechanized equipment cannot fully exert its power, and transportation and replenishment are particularly difficult. Because the Japanese army's manpower is insufficient, its attacks often fall into the Chinese army's counter-encirclement and suffer the Chinese army's counter-annihilation. The battle in Northern Hubei in May last year, the battle in Northern Hunan in October, the battle in Guinan in February this year, and even the recent battle in the Hubei-Henan border area, are all the same. However, the Japanese army's losses are probably greater in this recent battle. This further proves that the Japanese army's strategic means are also weakening because they cannot adapt to the new operational environment. As far as the evolution of the international situation is concerned, Japan may celebrate the expansion of the European war, but it can be asserted that the more the European war expands and becomes tense, the more active and tougher the United States' anti-aggression policy towards the Far East will become. Therefore, the United States' expansion of its army and increase in defense is not mainly aimed at the Atlantic, but concentrates its efforts on the Pacific, which is another insurmountable difficulty caused by Japan's armed invasion of China.</p>
<p>In short, Japan's current situation can be said to be in a difficult state of cause and effect, that is, in a circular contradictory state. As far as China is concerned, it is hovering between military aggression and political aggression. After the military operations failed, it turned to reorganization in Nanjing. Obviously, the reorganization of Nanjing could not achieve success, and then it launched the battle in Northern Hubei, which also ended in a disastrous defeat. As far as foreign affairs are concerned, the time when the Japanese warlords failed in their invasion of China was also the day when Arita loudly advocated southward advance, which increasingly aroused the United States' resentment, that is, it increasingly increased the difficulty of Japan's invasion of China. This kind of cycle continues and contradictions increase day by day. Can Japan's future have a glimmer of hope? The defeat in Northern Hubei is only the prelude to its accelerated collapse.</p>
<h3>The Fall of Brussels to German Forces Yesterday; Western Front Battles Reach a Critical Stage; German Advance Less Than 100 Miles from Paris; Change of French Frontline Commander Favors Counteroffensive; Allied Forces in Belgium Retreat Westward from Brussels</h3>
<p>Paris - According to reliable sources, the situation on the Western Front this morning can be summarized in three aspects: (1) In the central region, south of the Sambre River, the German army deployed most of its tanks, totaling 2,500 to 3,000, in a fierce assault on our forces. Judging by the enemy's strategy, they intended to break through the French lines with this tank force to achieve a quick victory. Therefore, yesterday, they repeatedly attacked the areas of Hirson, Avesnes, and Vervins, with vehicles clashing and surging like a tide. As a result, although they made some progress in the Avesnes area, our forces, after several counterattacks, have achieved local victories. In the Vervins area, fierce fighting between the two armies is ongoing. Although the enemy also made some progress, they were ultimately blocked by our tank forces. Considering the battles in these areas, our army has more artillery and can concentrate firepower to bombard the German tank forces. The air force is also assisting from the sky, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy. In addition, a large number of British and French bombers and fighter planes are concentrated in the triangle formed by the cities of Le Cateau, Vervins, and Avesnes, bombing enemy communication lines day and night. Thousands of tons of bombs have been dropped, and millions of machine gun bullets have been fired. Therefore, the German tank force's advance has been very difficult. As of this morning, a major battle has erupted again. In addition to the frontal assault, the enemy is also pressing from the left and right flanks, but with less force than on the front. (2) In the southern region, on the line from Sedan to Montmédy, the enemy's offensive has stalled after being fiercely attacked head-on by our forces. (3) In the northern region, within Belgium, north of the Sambre River, the British and Belgian Allied forces had blocked the enemy on the line of the Dyle River, east of the Belgian capital, on the previous night and yesterday. Now, for strategic reasons, they have retreated west of Brussels, and consequently, the cities of Brussels and Leuven (Louvain) have successively fallen. Overall, although the enemy's offensive has made some progress, they have encountered extreme difficulties everywhere. (Havas, 18th)</p>
<p>Paris - The powerful German blitzkrieg is now in its ninth day and continues to advance. The German advance has now reached a point only ninety miles from Paris. The war has now reached a critical stage, but the Allied forces are still putting up a desperate resistance. (Associated Press, 18th)</p>
<p>London - The northeastern French army, which is responsible for containing the German offensive, is now under the command of General Giraud, who previously served as the garrison commander of Metz and is currently a member of the Supreme Military Council. He enjoys a distinguished reputation in both England and France, and British authorities have expressed great satisfaction upon hearing the news. (Havas, 18th)</p>
<p>Paris - Today, the German attempt to advance into France seems to have been thwarted, as French forces launched a mechanized counteroffensive in the area around Saint-Quentin and Le Cateau, engaging in fierce combat with a large part of the German mechanized units, causing the German offensive to falter. Intense fighting is still ongoing, but French military circles claim that the Germans have indeed gradually retreated. According to military observers, although the German land and air forces launched relentless attacks last night and yesterday, the French positions have actually advanced this morning. (Associated Press, 18th)</p>
<p>London - According to the General Headquarters' communique and frontline reports, we are now in a major melee. The fighting is extremely fierce, and the overall situation is very serious, but it is by no means collapsing. A French government spokesman stated today that the General Headquarters remains calm in its decisions. We can only have full confidence in the commanders and the entire army and await the outcome. The retreat of the British and Belgian armies to positions west of Brussels was deliberate and purely for strategic reasons, completed without being seriously hampered by the enemy. In yesterday's major armored vehicle attack between the Sambre and Lys rivers, the Germans used at least half, or perhaps more, of their armored vehicle forces. Two to three thousand German tanks attacked in two directions: northward towards Avesnes and southward towards Vervins and the vicinity of Hirson. The fighting was extremely fierce. Although we lost some ground, our army has become accustomed to tank attacks and is not afraid. It counterattacks whenever possible and achieves considerable results. Therefore, this battle cannot be considered a failure. Further south, near Vervins, the enemy made an even more forceful advance. This battle ended at a position that had been selected by the Allied General Headquarters early on. There, French armored vehicles encountered German armored vehicles, and the French troops retreated in good order. (Reuters, 18th)</p>
<p>Berlin - The German High Command declared, "German forces besieging Leuven have occupied the city today. The British and French positions south of Leuven have also been broken through. German forces entered the Belgian capital, Brussels, tonight." (Haitong, 17th)</p>
<p>Bern, Switzerland - The German semi-official agency, the German News Agency, recently issued a communique from the German High Command stating, "German forces broke through the British and French positions south of Leuven late tonight and attacked the Belgian capital, Brussels. The Belgian government moved elsewhere yesterday." The communique also stated, "German forces broke through the Dyle River line north of Leuven and occupied the city of Mechelen." It also reported that "The city of Leuven has fallen to German forces after a period of intense fighting." (Havas, 17th)</p>
<p>Paris - The General Headquarters issued a battle report this morning stating that, within our country, our and the enemy are continuing to fight fiercely in the positions mentioned in yesterday's battle report (i.e., the northern city of Avesnes, the city of Vervins, and the northwest of the city of Le Cateau). In Belgium, the Allied forces, in light of the overall situation, have implemented a retreat and are defending positions west of Brussels. Our aircraft attacked enemy positions and communications at night. (Havas, 18th)</p>
<p>London - Reliable sources stated last night that the German motorized units launched a fierce attack northwest of Mechelen yesterday, apparently attempting to threaten the Allied forces' communications in Belgium. According to authoritative observations, the military situation in France has become very serious. However, the Allied forces still have complete confidence in overcoming the difficulties. One military observer believes that, given the intensity of the war, the German claim that they have captured more than 12,000 people is not entirely unreasonable. According to authoritative sources, the German forces attacking in Mechelen have caused some Allied units, which were previously defending east of Brussels, to withdraw from the Belgian front line. It is reported that the German forces are attacking in the Paris area with tank units, each with 400 tanks, totaling two or three units. In Belgium, there are one or two tank units in operation. In total, the German tank force in the west has eight units. (Associated Press, 18th)</p>
<p>German Forces Advance from Breakthrough Point, Spreading Out in a Fan Shape to the North and South. Berlin - German Supreme Headquarters information states that German forces have broken through data points on the Maginot Line, along one hundred kilometers from Maubeuge to Carignan. The information states, "France's impregnable defense line, which guards its eastern front, has now been breached." Well-informed neutral military circles here call the breakthrough of the Allied lines an "unstable achievement of German force" and do not believe this is the beginning of a decisive battle on the Western Front. They suggest that Germany may attempt a large arc-shaped encirclement towards the English Channel in the north. German newspapers report that German troops are surging across the breached 100-mile defensive line in all directions, fanning out to the northwest and southeast in an attempt to widen their breakthrough point. The German press reports that German bombers are dropping large quantities of highly incendiary bombs on British and French rear units and Allied railways and highways. If the French counterattacks on the flanks of the German forces are unsuccessful, the Allied forces in northern Belgium and northeastern France will be in a desperate situation. German forces can counterattack from the rear and press towards the Dyle River line. German forces, attacking from Liege and Maastricht towards that line, have breached a stronghold south of Wavre. (Associated Press, 18th)</p>
<p>Paris - According to reports from frontline military observers, a large-scale "war of movement" has begun in central Belgium and northern France, gradually expanding its scope. The German motorized units, assisted by the air force, are making fan-shaped advances in all directions and have indeed made progress. Small tank units have penetrated deep into enemy territory, too far from their bases, and have been quickly annihilated by the Allied forces. The Allied forces are now paying attention to the German motorized units that have lost contact with their bases and are launching counterattacks on their flanks. The French army is now holding positions between the Scheldt River (i.e., the Escaut River) and the Sambre River, and British aircraft have inflicted heavy damage on the enemy's motorized units. (Havas, 17th)</p>
<p>General Gamelin Urges Soldiers: "Rather Die in Battle Than Abandon an Inch of Territory"</p>
<p>Paris - General Gamelin, Commander-in-Chief of the National Defense Forces, issued an order to encourage all soldiers, with poignant words, saying, "The war has already begun. This war is truly related to the fate of our country, our allies, and the entire world. The armies of England, Belgium, and Poland, as well as foreign volunteers, are fighting alongside us. The British Air Force is also engaging the enemy planes with all its might, just like our air force. All our soldiers bear the heavy responsibility of defending the country's territory. If you cannot advance, rather die in battle. You must never abandon an inch of territory. According to our country's history, whenever we face a major crisis, we can only abide by one maxim: 'Either victory or death.' I believe we will surely achieve final victory." (Havas, 17th)</p>
<p>Geneva - According to news received here, French Chief of Staff General Georges is about to leave his post because General Gamelin is deeply dissatisfied with the strategies planned by Georges for the battles in Belgium. (Haitong, 18th)</p>
<p>German Offensive Avoids Key Points, Resulting in the Loss of France's Northeastern Barrier</p>
<p>Paris - According to various military experts, the Maginot Line originally ended at the city of Montmédy, which is thirty kilometers east of the city of Sedan. The German army never attempted to attack it, wanting to avoid key points, so it did not hesitate to go this way to find weaker points in the French border defense. This kind of thinking has become clear. Furthermore, the German strategy is to seek a quick victory at any cost, while the French army maintains good discipline on one hand and responds with calm and composure on the other. (Havas, 18th)</p>
<p>Berlin - According to an official German report released last night, the last line of defense of the British and French armies in Belgium, the Dyle Line, has been broken through by German forces. The speed of the German advance has greatly exceeded British and French expectations. The British and French positions in Antwerp have also been greatly shaken as a result. In the Netherlands, German forces are continuing to clear out the remaining enemy forces on the islands, but this is no longer as important compared to the battles in Belgium. On the French side, German forces have broken through the Maginot Line, crossing the Meuse River and breaking through the 100-kilometer line from south of Maubeuge to southeast of Montmédy. The eastern barrier of France is now no longer impenetrable. German forces are pursuing and capturing fleeing French prisoners in that area, totaling 12,000 people, including two generals. Yesterday, the German air force bombed enemy transport vehicles, railway stations, and ammunition depots, all with remarkable effect. Fifty-eight enemy planes were shot down in aerial combat. (Haitong, 18th)</p>
<p>Antwerp Replaces Flag with German Flag, German Forces Fail to Cross Canal</p>
<p>Berlin - The German High Command declared this afternoon that our army has now broken through the Antwerp fortress area and entered the city. The German war flag has been raised in Antwerp. (Haitong, 18th)</p>
<p>Berlin - A communique from German Commander-in-Chief von Brauchitsch declared that German forces have invaded the outer defenses of Antwerp from two locations. South of Maldegem, German armored vehicle units have broken through the fortresses along the French border, destroying two enemy divisions and pursuing retreating enemy forces across the Upper Sambre River. German forces south of Sedan have advanced and occupied land to the south. The German air force has attacked communication lines within Belgium and France. All roads are filled with powerful enemy columns, and several locations have been bombed. (Reuters, 18th)</p>
<p>Brussels - According to a Belgian battle report released last night, "Our army is conducting operations systematically according to the planned operational plan. On Thursday afternoon, the light infantry regiment participating in the defense of the Albert Canal repelled German forces attempting to cross the bridge over the river, inflicting heavy damage on them." (Reuters, 18th)</p>
<p>Zeeland Islands Garrison Withdraws, All of the Netherlands Falls Under German Control</p>
<p>London - After the islands of Walcheren and Beveland in the Dutch province of Zeeland were repeatedly bombed by German planes, the French Marines originally stationed on the islands were withdrawn with the agreement of the French commander and the Dutch military authorities. Fierce fighting took place at the mouth of the Scheldt River (i.e., the Escaut River) in Zeeland Province. Military facilities of value there, such as the docks, gasoline pools, and shipyards in the port of Vlissingen on Walcheren Island, have been completely destroyed by Dutch troops to prevent them from being used by the enemy. Furthermore, all faculty and students of the Dansa Aviation School on the island have flown to British and French air bases in training aircraft. (Havas, 17th)</p>
<p>Hitler's Headquarters - Yesterday, German forces continued to advance in the Netherlands. On the Zeeland Islands, German forces made great efforts to clear out the enemy forces and have achieved significant success. On the island of Walcheren in Vlissingen, fighting continues. The Dutch commander applied for surrender. On the Zuiderzee Islands, German forces captured 2,000 Dutch and foreign soldiers. Some of the Dutch warships recently trapped in various ports have surrendered to Germany. Several Dutch coastal batteries have also been occupied by the Germans. (Haitong, 18th)</p>
<p>London - According to a radio station in Hilversum, Netherlands, which is controlled by the Germans, martial law has been declared in all occupied areas of the Netherlands. The radio station also listed "crimes" that will be severely punished, such as assisting civilians to escape from German-occupied areas or providing information detrimental to German interests. The exchange rate has been set at one and a half guilders for one mark. Military authorities must accept receipts issued for purchases over 500 marks. At present, Dutch troops will be sent to various places to carry out repairs. (Reuters, 18th)</p>
<p>London - A German official radio broadcast warned Germans that they must make significant sacrifices, saying, "We know that there are still very difficult tasks to be fulfilled. These tasks will require great self-sacrifice from the country and the frontline troops, but we all know that for the sake of Germany's victory, no sacrifice is too great." (Reuters, 18th)</p>
<h3>London and Paris Become Cities of Sorrow as Residents Evacuate</h3>
<p>London - Because the German army blatantly disregards all the norms of war and its vast blitzkrieg tactics are rapidly advancing on the Western Front, London has become a city of sorrow today. Although the British people have not lost their spirit and determination, the recent news of the German advance seems to have had a serious impact on the British people. (Associated Press, 18th)</p>
<p>London - Approximately 10,000 children have been moved from eastern London to South Wales. Before being settled in private homes, they will be temporarily housed in churches, schools, and other buildings. (Reuters, 18th)</p>

<p>Milan - According to newspaper reports from Paris, French military authorities have prohibited Paris residents from moving elsewhere. Those who leave the capital must obtain special permits. Because people are currently restless, emigration is prohibited in order to avoid large-scale evacuations. (Haitong, 18th) In Geneva, all public transportation in Paris was stopped yesterday, with only buses still operating in some areas. (Haitong, 18th)</p>

<h3>Famous French General Pétain Joins War Cabinet; Premier Reynaud Concurrently Appointed Minister of War; Weygand Returns to the Country to Participate in Military Affairs</h3>
<p>Paris - The State Council recently issued a bulletin stating that General Pétain, the French ambassador to Spain, returned to this city from Madrid today. He was received by Premier and Foreign Minister Reynaud, who immediately invited him to join the cabinet as an associate minister without portfolio. He has already indicated his acceptance. In addition, it is necessary to concentrate power in politics and military affairs during the current war. This has been proven by the recent battles. Therefore, Premier Reynaud has, with the consent of Minister of National Defense and Minister of War Daladier, concurrently assumed the positions of Minister of National Defense and Minister of War, while Daladier has taken over the position of Foreign Minister. Furthermore, Minister of the Interior Roy has resigned, and his vacancy has been filled by Minister of Colonies Mandel. The vacant position of Minister of Colonies has been succeeded by Minister of Commerce Rollin, and Barty (a member of parliament from the central faction) has succeeded as Minister of Commerce. Premier Reynaud is scheduled to give a radio address at 8 p.m. tonight. (Havas, 18th)</p>
<p>Paris - General Weygand, Commander-in-Chief of French Forces in the Near East, is reported to have arrived here.

Military leaders were invited to attend the meeting, and Churchill reported on his hurried visit to Paris. (Haitong, 18th)</p>
<p>Paris - Well-informed sources claim that Prime Minister Churchill's trip to Paris on Thursday was a great victory, rare in his experience. Churchill's talks in Paris until late at night made an extraordinarily deep impression, and all were moved by his firm determination. (Reuters, 18th)</p>
<p>London - It is generally believed that Prime Minister Churchill's trip to Paris on Thursday was due to the serious war situation, and he went to discuss new strategies with the French. (Associated Press, 18th)</p>
<p>London - Prime Minister Churchill recently wrote to Chamberlain, the Lord President of the Council, saying that as Prime Minister of a national government including three parties, it does not seem appropriate for him to hold the leadership of any one party. He hopes that Chamberlain will continue to lead the Conservative Party. (Reuters, 18th)</p>
<h3>Fierce Aerial Battles in French Airspace</h3>
<p>London - British Hurricane fighter squadrons engaged German Junkers bomber squadrons in French airspace yesterday and shot down seven German planes. The details are as follows: At the time, the British squadrons spotted 20 enemy bombers circling over a forest in France. They immediately divided into three teams. One attacked from high altitude, while the other two patrolled in the upper air, preparing to intercept. The German fighter squadron then saw that the enemy bomber squadrons did not have fighter escorts and immediately joined the aerial battle, ultimately shooting down nine enemy planes. Later, on the return journey, they encountered a German plane and shot it down as well, and then safely flew back to their base. (Havas, 18th)</p>
<h3>British Planes Bomb Germany, Disrupting Military Communications and Inflicting Heavy Damage on Advancing German Troops; German Planes Fail to Attack British Airfields</h3>
<p>London - According to an official announcement, on Thursday night, British Air Force bomber units again attacked military targets in western Germany, scoring several direct hits. The aircraft participating in this air raid were all medium bombers. Enemy transport vehicles and gasoline depots around Sedan were bombed, and several fires broke out. On Thursday, the enemy's repeated fierce attacks in the Meuse River valley were met with attacks by the British Air Force, which destroyed pontoon bridges, blocked roads, and dropped bombs and opened machine gun fire on advancing enemy troops. Enemy troops in important locations were hampered, and their mechanized units suffered heavy damage. Yesterday, the Air Force was quite active in the British sector, and bombers repeatedly and fiercely attacked enemy mechanized columns. Although the enemy had strong fighter squadrons assisting their advance, our bombers still flew low to attack and inflicted heavy damage on them. Lysander fighter planes, which were assisting the French army in combat, encountered a large number of enemy planes and anti-aircraft fire when attacking important positions in Gembloux. At dawn, British fighter planes intercepted nine German Stuka bombers heading to attack British airfields, shooting down two and forcing the rest to flee. When German planes bombed another city defended by the British Air Force, three more were shot down. In the past two days, light anti-aircraft batteries defending British airfields have shot down at least ten enemy planes. The German High Command announced yesterday that the Allied forces had lost 1,462 aircraft. However, this was a mistake in publishing their own losses. In reality, the Allied losses are only a small portion of what the Germans have claimed. However, although the German Air Force has suffered such heavy losses, their reserves are still sufficient and will be able to maintain their efforts for some time to come. (Reuters, 18th)</p>
<h3>Estimate of German Air Force Losses; Exceeds 1,000 Since the Invasion of the Netherlands and Belgium</h3>
<p>London - The Ministry of Aviation claims that it is now believed that the German Air Force has lost more than 1,000 aircraft since the invasion of the Netherlands and Belgium. In addition, their losses in Poland and Norway must be added. (Reuters, 18th)</p>
<p>Berlin - The German High Command announced today that the German side again gained the upper hand in yesterday's aerial battles. Within one day, the enemy lost 108 aircraft. Of these, 35 were shot down directly by German planes in aerial combat, and 11 were shot down by anti-aircraft fire. The rest were destroyed by German planes while parked at airfields. As for the German side, only 26 aircraft are missing. The main targets of the enemy air raids were several cities and towns on the German northern coast, especially Hamburg and Bremen. Several locations in western Germany were also attacked by enemy planes, but the damage was minimal. (Haitong, 18th)</p>

Boden continued, saying that the current situation reminded him of the early weeks of the last great war, but today was not as critical as then, and they would soon find a remedy as they did in the past. He urged those bearing arms to express their enthusiasm, protect their compatriots, and unite closely like brothers. He added that many families had been destroyed, dispersed, or broken, and many people had to endure future hardships due to the destruction of their homes. He said that their thoughts were with them, and Belgium would defend its independence to the end because without independence, there was no nation. All their hopes would be revived only after independence was restored. (Reuters, 18th)</p>

<h3>U.S. Under Secretary of State Speaks: Defending Western Civilization, Willing to Live Peacefully with Other Countries, Eliminating All Human Fears</h3>
<p>Washington – Under Secretary of State Welles delivered a speech today, stating, "I deeply believe that the threat currently facing human civilization will disappear, and the destructive forces invented by mankind will also be torn apart one day. In the future, we must establish a better world to relieve all fears for all mankind and establish individual freedom of belief, freedom of thought, and freedom of speech. Our duty lies in defending Western civilization until true peace is restored. Our attitude is to maintain neutrality and live peacefully with other countries while also resolutely defending our new world and all cultural systems. This attitude should be known to the world. In terms of international relations, it is not enough for the interests of governments to align; the peoples of all countries must recognize the value of working together towards common goals to be effective." He concluded by saying, "The United States has received great gifts from the Old World, which is a real situation. However, if the current war continues, it will cause various changes in Europe. If that happens, U.S. civilization will also be significantly affected." (Havas, 17th)</p>

<h3>Swiss Confederation Prepared for Any Eventuality, Especially Watching Italy's Attitude</h3>
<p>Swiss Capital – After reviewing the international situation last night, a senior Swiss military officer declared that there was no need to take further military measures because the army was fully prepared and on a war footing. Everything that can be done is being done as much as possible, and we can only wait patiently for the development of the situation. Responsible sources here stated directly that one thing is quite gratifying: there are signs of a more peaceful tendency on the Italian side. Political observers believe that a certain relevant country recently tested Switzerland's nerves. If the Western Front war eventually comes to a standstill, Switzerland may eventually be in danger. At present, Italy still shows many signs of paying attention to Swiss neutrality. (Reuters, 18th)</p>

<h3>Italy's Attitude Still Hesitant: No Change in Mediterranean Situation, U.S. President's Telegram Being Studied Carefully, Britain Plans to Revise Naval Inspection Methods</h3>
<p>Rome – Diplomatic circles here recently stated that there has been no change in the Mediterranean situation, but there is a slight tendency for it to escalate. The recent alarms were all due to fantasy, and nothing unexpected is likely to happen, at least in the next week. Although the Italian Navy can be mobilized immediately in a few hours, the Army still needs some time for deployment in order to maximize its power. The pressure that Germany is currently putting on Belgium and France is not pleasing to Italian public opinion, contrary to the views of certain newspapers. Some Italian observers have begun to feel that their country will also be threatened by Germany one day. (Havas, 17th)</p>
<p>London – Political circles here recently stated that the Italian issue is currently only of secondary importance. Although the country's attitude has not softened by last night, it has at least become hesitant. In addition, the British government is currently drafting a plan to revise the current naval inspection methods to make their implementation more flexible, or even to avoid implementing them in the Mediterranean, to avoid causing displeasure to neutral countries, especially Italy. Italian newspapers have recently used this blockade method as an excuse to criticize Britain and France for hindering their freedom of trade. If these statements are only aimed at opposing the inspection and are not an excuse for the country to prepare for war, then once the British government adopts a sincere attitude, the relations between Britain and Italy will immediately improve, without a doubt. However, on the other hand, Italian Foreign Minister Ciano's recent speech was not encouraging. In general, the ultimate key to Italy's attitude towards the current European war depends on how Italian Prime Minister Mussolini judges the state of Germany's victory and the "degree of readiness" of domestic public opinion. In short, Prime Minister Mussolini does not seem likely to make any decision until he is absolutely sure. However, although the country has not made this final decision at this moment, Britain and France must still take maximum precautionary measures in the Mediterranean and must not be negligent. In short, Britain's current attitude has not changed and will not do anything to worsen relations between Britain and Italy, but at the same time, it is also prepared to deal with any unexpected events. That is all. (Havas, 17th)</p>
<p>Rome – The Giornale d'Italia recently used the alleged arrest of Maltese as an excuse to criticize "Britain's tyranny," saying that Britain rules Malta under martial law and that the situation there is "very serious." (Reuters, 18th)</p>
<p>Rome – Official sources claim that President Roosevelt's telegram to Mussolini is currently being "carefully studied." However, because the telegram is of a private nature, no information can be provided about its contents, and it is too early to predict what the Prime Minister's response will be. At the same time, the number of political observers who firmly believe that Italy will remain non-combatant is decreasing day by day. Train tickets to the border are fully booked for British and French nationals. The national demonstration scheduled for next Sunday is currently being prepared. The Fascist weekly review, edited by Italian Education Minister Bottai, said, "Britain's hegemony in the Mediterranean is intolerable. We must solve this problem, or we will miss the opportunity."

<h3>Roosevelt Proposes Building 50,000 Airplanes: Requests Emergency Defense Funds, Both Houses Prepare to Enact Legislation</h3>
<p>Washington – The U.S. Senate and House of Representatives began yesterday to prepare to quickly enact legislation for President Roosevelt's request for $1,800,000,000 in emergency defense funds. Some Congressional leaders claimed that the bill would be ready next week for the President to sign. The President's request will increase defense spending for the next fiscal year, starting July 1, to $3,000,000,000. This funding will cost each American $25. This increase in funding is only the beginning, as President Roosevelt proposed building 50,000 airplanes. Yesterday, the President told reporters that the government would build aircraft factories to help private aircraft factories quickly build 50,000 airplanes annually because of the urgency of the European war. The President canceled his plans to return to Hyde Park this weekend and travel to the western United States. The White House received hundreds of telegrams yesterday supporting the plan to build 50,000 airplanes. Military experts estimate that it will take two and a half years to build 50,000 airplanes. Army and Navy officials are currently planning to build 20,000 Army airplanes and 1,000 Navy airplanes first. Military officials admitted that training pilots is a major problem. Military experts refused to estimate the cost of 50,000 airplanes. The new airplanes will be known for their speed, maneuverability, and range, and will include various advantages of German airplanes. (Associated Press, 18th)</p>
<p>Washington – It is generally believed that President Roosevelt's defense proposal is only the beginning. According to some political observers, Treasury officials are now discussing privately increasing defense spending by $10 billion before 1942. As newspapers began criticizing the passage of the new defense program in Congress, they were busy warning the national public that this new armament spending must be paid for. The most common fundraising suggestion is to greatly increase income taxes. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<p>Washington – The House Army Committee is currently studying how to submit legislation to Congress in a short period of time to implement the expansion plan based on President Roosevelt's defense message yesterday. Army Department representative General Cassel recently submitted a bill to the committee, advocating the repeal of the current law restricting the Army to no more than 6,000 airplanes. (Havas, 17th)</p>
<p>Washington – President Roosevelt recently gave a speech to the press, stating, "I originally intended to tour the western regions after Congress adjourned, but I have now abandoned that plan. I have discussed the development of airplane manufacturing with experts, and I especially focus on the government assisting the various aircraft factories. In the Navy, the 35 destroyers that participated in the last war have been disarmed, and we plan to re-equip them with weapons and incorporate them into the fleet. In short, the number of factories producing airplanes and anti-aircraft guns should be increased, and these factories should be distributed in various places. In addition, the production of various components should be increased, and the training of skilled workers should be facilitated. Oil refineries should also be added. The government should establish a special agency to guarantee and support the major rearmament program of President Roosevelt. Many believe that their support for President Roosevelt's program has formed an unparalleled defense alliance." (Reuters, 18th)</p>

<h3>By the Xue Tao Well of the Tang Dynasty - Gold Digging Continues at Jin River (Continued) - Zhang Xianzhong Buried Tens of Thousands in Gold Under the Jin River - Scientific Methods are Now Being Used to Excavate Near Wangjiang Tower</h3>
<p>On May 2nd, behind Stone Ox Ridge, more than seventy stone bars were excavated, many still bearing inscriptions and the symbol "(一)." Beneath the stone bars were countless layers of horizontally laid, decayed wood. Further below, several Da Shun coins, cast by Zhang Xianzhong, were unearthed. This is the seventh minor sign.</p>
<p>Two months after starting work last year on this very day, so many indications have been discovered that it is not without reason that the company's records are credible, and the public, upon hearing of it, cannot but be excited.</p>
<p>Scientific Proof</p>
<p>Though the results of last spring's work yielded many signs, whether or not treasure lies beneath the sandbar remains a mystery. What scientific method could be used to prove it? During the ten months of suspension, the company concentrated all its efforts on resolving this question. Should they try a drilling rig? The work site is conveniently located in the river's center, where the geological stratum is all sand and gravel, making the use of a drilling rig quite difficult. Finally, it was decided to use a wireless gold detector to prospect for metal deposits. Last autumn, they hired three mining experts, Xu Weili, Zhang Zhonghua, and Liu Fubo, to oversee production in Chengdu. After several months of work, the gold detector was finally made.</p>
<p>With the gold detector made, the question of the instrument's accuracy is worthy of note. To test the effectiveness of the gold detector, the company's representatives and the three experts contacted Chengdu Qiming Electric Company to test the underground cables of the electric company. The results were very satisfactory. The course of the underground cables was completely mapped out by this gold detector.</p>
<p>The gold detector is made according to the principle of wireless radio balance. It utilizes a directional antenna transmitter and a directional antenna receiver. It is adjusted in a non-metallic area until no sound is heard (i.e., the balanced position). The relative positions of the transmitter and receiver are fixed. In a metallic area, the balance is lost due to the metal reflecting radio waves, and the receiver emits a bell-like ringing sound.</p>
<p>Starting in January this spring, exploration of the sandbar began. There were indeed metal reactions, all of which were man-made geometric shapes, covering an area of one hundred square zhang. There are also many scattered, small pieces of metal. The depth of burial and what kind of metal remains to be judged.</p>
<p>One day, they were playing around with the gold detector at the work site and suddenly discovered a circular metal response. Inside and outside the circle, however, there was no reaction. The circle's diameter was one and a half city feet. Driven by curiosity, they began to dig. At a depth of four feet, they suddenly discovered a headless, bottomless tin basin. After removing the tin basin, they used the detector again and found no response. To this day, the company's employees consider this a charming tale.</p>
<p>Continuing the Excavation</p>
<p>By Xue Tao's well near Wangjiang Tower, the project, imbued with the rich flavor of ancient charm and surrounded by the scientific atmosphere of the sound of motors, continues under the rippling spring breeze. It is believed that the stone oxen and stone drums unearthed last year on the sandbar, which is thought to hold boundless treasures, are still silently facing each other from afar. The right ear of the stone ox has been broken off, it is unknown by whom. Half of the broken ear is abandoned on the ox's back. The withered bones, stone bars, and the remains of the tin basin detected by the gold detector are piled up in a sandy corner for people to visit. Legend has it that when Zhang Xianzhong buried the gold, he cut off the river's flow. Although gold digging has not cut off the river now, it is being diverted. The river originally flowed along the right bank of the sandbar, but it has now been cut off, forcing it to flow down the left bank. The soil dug up for gold digging is used to build high dikes along the bank, so that work can continue as usual even during periods of high water.</p>
<p>In the center of the sandbar, a large wooden barrel towers, connected below to a reinforced concrete barrel. The concrete barrel is deeply embedded in the ground. The wooden barrel has a diameter of more than one zhang. Climbing up the ladder and looking down into the barrel, several workers are digging sand and mud at the bottom. The water that seeps in is drained into the river by motor pumps. By the end of April, the depth of the shaft-like excavation had reached over one zhang. The results of the gold detector's exploration show that the response here is the greatest, so it has been decided to continue digging down to five or six zhang, and then decide what to do based on the situation. Last spring's construction site is no more than three zhang away from the sinking barrel. Digging has now started there as well. The old method is still being used to drain water with dragon bone water lifters. The workers happily tread the wheels, diverting the seeping water, their songs floating on the river, leisurely and serene, simple and happy.</p>
<p>From time to time, people come here to visit. Chairman Lin and Minister Chen Cheng have both visited. The overseas Chinese repatriation delegation also came to visit on the evening of May 3rd. MGM Studios of America specially sent photographer Wang Xiaoting to Chengdu to film the gold digging. The Jin River gold digging project has indeed become famous at home and abroad, but whether or not gold can be dug up here remains to be proven by facts. However, the company's spirit of "seeking what can be sought, and not ceasing to know what cannot be done" is truly admirable. (May 3rd) (End)</p>

<p>Changzhou Communication, due to the hardships of the people in the countryside of Wujin, unemployed vagrants often engage in tomb robbing. Turning over corpses and smashing bones, even the spirits of the deceased in the underworld cannot rest in peace.

<h3>Middle School Cup Table Tennis Final - Hongyi Plays Huatong Today - 3:00 pm at Jingwu Hall</h3>
<p>The Middle School Cup Third Table Tennis Tournament, with a total of 24 teams participating, is divided into two groups, China and Hua, to compete. The top three teams from each group, Huatong, Youth Association, Hongyi, Fushiguang, and Daxia, are protecting their respective groups. The total standard is adopted, but Daxia withdrew halfway through. Five teams participated, and the strong and weak were gradually separated. Only Hongyi's last battle remains, scheduled for 3:00 pm today at the Jingwu Hall on the third floor of Cishu Building. If Hongyi is unfortunately defeated in this battle, then their score will be equal to that of Huatong and the Youth Association, and the championship seat will have to be decided again. Therefore, this battle is related to the gain or loss of the championship, and a fierce battle is inevitable.</p>

<h3>Defense Forces of Warring Nations Stationed in China Decide to Maintain the Status Quo in Central China; Inspector General of Customs Robert Hart Reaches Decision Through Consultations with Commanders of Various Nations; Italy's Participation in the War Is Unrelated to the Situation in Shanghai</h3>
<p>The situation in Europe is currently becoming increasingly severe. At the same time, Italy in the Mediterranean is poised for action, with tensions running high. According to various signs, it seems Italy is leaning towards the Nazi side, and declaring war is imminent. Italy has a marine corps stationed in Shanghai, with its defense area in the western district of the International Settlement along Robison Road, adjacent to the British defense forces along Great Western Road. To the south are the French defense forces of the French Concession. If Italy joins Germany in fighting against Britain and France, the situation for the European defense forces in this port will inevitably become very serious. Regarding this, it is learned that the leaders of the various national defense forces here have made proper arrangements. It was only yesterday that it was announced by foreign sources.</p>
<p>Defense Forces of Various Nations Hold Important Consultations</p>
<p>On the 7th of this month, Admiral Hepburn, Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet, invited the commanders of the defense forces of various European nations stationed in Central China for exploratory talks. A unanimous agreement was reached that even if the European war situation were to further expand and affect the home countries of these troops, the status quo here should be maintained. This agreement also applies to the defense forces of various nations stationed in North China. Therefore, even if the European situation deteriorates further, there is no need to worry about the situation in this port, especially with the United States acting as an intermediary to arbitrate everything, the future can naturally be smooth and worry-free.</p>
<p>According to the English-language *China Press*, it was announced today (the 18th) that Admiral Hepburn, Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet, held an inquiry-based meeting with the commanders of the European forces stationed in Central China on the 7th of this month. All the commanders quickly agreed that when the European war continued to expand and affect their home countries, they would, to the best of their ability, maintain the peaceful status quo of the troops stationed in Central and North China.</p>
<p>Newspaper Records Engage in Extensive Provocation</p>
<p>However, the Japanese side in this port is adopting a wait-and-see attitude, believing that the development of the situation is extremely serious. The Japanese-language *Continental Daily News*, which is usually regarded as the mouthpiece of the Japanese military in Central China, published an article yesterday morning regarding this matter. One point stated that even if the leaders of the defense forces of various nations in Shanghai had reached an agreement, there was still the possibility of "unexpected incidents" occurring involving the defense forces of the warring nations here. The second point stated that the foreign defense authorities, diplomatic circles, and foreign trading companies here were paying close attention to Italy's movements, and they strongly believed in Germany's powerful offensive on the European front. The wording was intimidating throughout. Examining its intention, it seems to be the same as last September, when the European war broke out, and the Japanese government immediately requested that the European belligerent nations withdraw their troops stationed in China (the Japanese-occupied areas) to avoid conflict. At that time, the British and French sides refused, pointing out that Germany had no troops stationed in China, so there would be no conflict. As for future developments, thanks to the foresight of U.S. Admiral Hepburn, who took precautions and solemnly obtained a unanimous guarantee from the leaders of the defense forces of various European nations to maintain the status quo, even if the situation in the Mediterranean deteriorated, the Japanese side would have no excuse to change the status quo of the defense forces in the Shanghai concessions.</p>
<p>French Municipal Council Remits Funds to Motherland</p>
<p>The French Municipal Council of the French Concession has recently decided to purchase French government military bonds with all the funds available to the Council, totaling five million francs (market price of 2.90 francs per yuan). It is also heard that these funds have now been remitted to the Paris Treasury for verification. This action by the French Municipal Council is in imitation of what some cities in France have done.</p>
<p>Foreign Nationals Donate to Aid the Netherlands</p>
<p>According to Mr. Baesvens, the Dutch Consul-General, Sassoon and other foreign nationals in this port, sympathetic to the Netherlands' resistance, donated 15,000 yuan in legal tender to the Dutch Red Cross yesterday. The Dutch Consulate has accepted the donation and will remit it to the motherland.</p>
<p>Trade with China Greatly Affected</p>
<p>According to the *China Press*, the most recent *Millard's Review* stated that the German invasion of the Netherlands and Belgium is detrimental to European trade with China. If Germany occupies the Netherlands and Belgium, the commercial activity of these two countries with the Far East will automatically cease, because the Allied nations still control the seas. On the other hand, if the German offensive fails and the Dutch and Belgian defense lines are not broken, the two countries will shift from economic activities to focusing on maintaining their defenses. Even if their exports do not completely stop, they will be greatly reduced. Belgian trade with China is very important. Among China's imports of steel plates, electrical materials, etc., Belgian goods have always been the most significant. In recent months, Dutch ships have ranked eighth in foreign shipping in Shanghai and sixth in all ports in China. The withdrawal of Dutch ships from the Far East will greatly weaken the position of Western shipping in the Far East.</p>
<p>Javanese Currency Linked to U.S. Dollar</p>
<p>According to sources in foreign banking circles in this port, the matter of separating the currencies of the Netherlands and the Dutch East Indies (i.e., the Javanese guilder) and linking the latter to the U.S. dollar was implemented yesterday morning. Therefore, foreign banks in this port reopened exchange rates for the Javanese guilder yesterday, with 100 yuan in legal tender converting to 10.125 Javanese guilders. This means that the exchange rate between the Javanese guilder and the U.S. dollar is two to one. As for the currency of the Netherlands itself, quotations have not yet been opened.</p>
<p>French and Italian Mail Ships Attempt to Maintain Calm</p>
<p>The French mail ship company at No. 9 The Bund in this city, due to the precarious situation in the Mediterranean, has been strictly keeping the dates and itineraries of its mail ships entering and leaving secret since the day before yesterday to prevent danger from occurring, and will no longer announce them in advance. However, according to well-informed sources, the company had not yet received orders from Paris to detour as of yesterday. Therefore, the mail ships may still travel via the Mediterranean. As for the attitude of the Italian mail ship company, it is quite silent, as if quietly observing the changes in the situation. However, according to a person from the company speaking to reporters, there will be no changes to the company's itineraries and schedules in the very short term.</p>
<p>Commander of the French Forces Hosts a Tea Party with Great Success</p>
<p>According to the French-language *Shanghai Daily News*, Colonel Aissouty, the commander of the French garrison, and his wife held a tea party at their private residence on Qiqi Road the night before last (the 17th). Those in attendance included Mr. Bigot, representing French Ambassador Cosme; Mr. Gioia Mussi, representing the Italian Ambassador; Mrs. Masu, wife of the Italian Ambassador; Polish Chargé d'Affaires Rosset; British Consul-General George; Belgian Consul-General Goutson; Dutch Consul-General Baesvens; Spanish Consul-General Ical; U.S. Asiatic Fleet Commander Hepburn; British Yangtze River Fleet Commander Glasford; U.S. Cruiser *Augusta* Commander Magruder; Japanese Garrison Commander Hasegawa; British Garrison Commander Simons; U.S. Marine Corps Fourth Regiment Commander Wedemeyer; Italian *San Marco* Marine Corps Commander Morandi; French Consul-General Oki; French Navy *Garnier* Warship Captain Rubin; French Garrison Commander of Shanghai District Attikos; Military Attaché and Air Force Counselor Jiffordan. In addition, there were also officials from the French and other countries' consulates and garrisons in Shanghai, and senior officials from the British and French concessions, totaling more than 350 guests, making it a grand event.</p>
<h3>U.S. Foreign Trade Week Begins; Celebrations by Chinese and Foreigners Alike; Today Is International Friendship Sunday; May 22 Is U.S. Maritime Day</h3>
<p>U.S. Foreign Trade Week begins today. According to reports yesterday, the American Chamber of Commerce in this port will hold two major celebrations. A luncheon will be held next Friday (the 25th) at the American Club, jointly with the Associated American Universities, to host Chinese students who are going to study in the United States this year. More than a dozen students from the seven American schools in this port and their families will accompany them. A grand banquet will be held in the evening to host American expatriates in this port, with film screenings and speeches by famous people.</p>
<p>International Friendship</p>
<p>According to the English-language *China Press*, American expatriates in Shanghai, under the leadership of the American Chamber of Commerce, have scheduled a week from the 19th to the 25th of this month to commemorate "U.S. Foreign Trade Week." The 19th is called "International Friendship Sunday." American churches and religious organizations will have special commemorative programs. At 10:00 AM, Captain Margan, the chaplain of the U.S. Marine Corps Fourth Regiment, will preside over a special service at the Grand Theater. Lieutenant Colonel Dunshire, the chaplain of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet, will be invited to speak on the topic of "International Friendship." At 11:00 AM, a commemorative service will be held at the American Community Church. At 7:00 PM, the Navy YMCA will also hold a service, with Smith speaking on "Sino-American Relations," and the public is welcome to attend.</p>
<p>Maritime Day</p>
<p>May 22 is U.S. Maritime Day. On this day, American expatriates in Shanghai will fly American flags at their homes, businesses, and cars to commemorate the occasion. May 20 is the date when the American merchant ship *Savannah*, the world's first steamship to cross the Atlantic Ocean, departed from the United States. Therefore, it has been designated as Maritime Day.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Concerned About People's Hardships; Orders Shops to Quickly Reduce Prices; As the Value of Legal Tender Rises, Commodity Prices Should Naturally Be Reduced; Strict Sanctions Will Be Imposed If Manipulation Continues</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council, in view of the dramatic changes in Shanghai exchange rates and the arbitrary increases in the prices of various commodities, has noted that although the exchange market has improved recently, commodity prices have not automatically decreased, which has greatly affected the livelihood of citizens. Therefore, on this (18th) day, the Council sent letters to various related commercial organizations, urging them to instruct their member stores to reduce sales prices by a certain date, and to strictly comply with the methods stipulated in the Council's Proclamation No. 5233. Any violations will be severely punished. The original letter is transcribed below:</p>
<p>Prices of Main Items Should Be Immediately Marked</p>
<p>In order to maintain security within the Settlement, the Council has recently established methods to improve social living conditions. However, some members of your association have not yet complied with the Council's Proclamation No. 5233, which requires them to display and mark the prices of the main items they sell. We are now writing to urge your association to promptly pay attention and immediately comply with the methods established by the Council. Do not delay any further.</p>
<p>As Currency Value Rises, Commodity Prices Should Decrease</p>
<p>In recent days, the value of Chinese legal tender has increased. However, retail stores have reduced commodity prices very little, or not at all. This situation must also be evident to your association. Commodity prices that were increased due to the decline in exchange rates should naturally be reduced when the price of Chinese legal tender rises (unless reasons satisfactory to the Council can be provided). Please inform your members that once the exchange rate improves, they must immediately reduce retail commodity prices so that the general public can benefit together.</p>
<p>Strict Enforcement Against Violations of Laws and Regulations</p>
<p>If you continue to disregard the Council's proclamations regarding necessities, and if there is any monopolistic speculation or hoarding of various main items, the Council will take appropriate steps to impose sanctions. Finally, the Council must state that it has no intention of interfering with or restricting legitimate business operations or their just and lawful profits. However, if excessive prices continue to be charged and attempts are made to undermine the Council's established methods for improving social living conditions, it will have no choice but to strictly enforce the regulations in order to protect the interests of the general public. In order to avoid misunderstandings, this circular and the Council's Proclamation No. 5233 have been translated into Chinese and are enclosed with this letter for your reference.</p>
<p>Market Price of Coal Briquettes Set to Plummet</p>
<p>After the market price of coal dust in this city plunged due to the sharp loosening of foreign exchange rates, prices are still expected to fall because of the continued surge in arrivals. Yesterday, the Hainan Loule vessel arrived in Shanghai, carrying more than 3,000 tons of Hongji white coal dust from French Indochina. At a time when hoarders are rushing to sell off their stocks, the further arrival of foreign coal will inevitably lead to a sharp drop in market prices. The market price of coal briquettes has already fallen four times, namely, 12 yuan the first time, 2 yuan the second time, 6 yuan the third time, and 4 yuan the fourth time. However, the total decrease is only 24 yuan per ton. The current wholesale price is 152 yuan per ton. Yesterday, the prices of various types of coal showed a trend of sharp decline, but in the end, they managed to maintain their original state. However, the sudden increase in available stock has attracted few buyers.</p>
<p>Gasoline and Soda Prices Reduced Simultaneously</p>
<p>The three major gasoline companies in this port, namely, Mobil, Asiatic Petroleum Company (Shell), and Texaco, reduced the price of gasoline by 20 cents per gallon yesterday in consideration of the interests of citizens, due to the recent improvement in foreign exchange rates. The price of gasoline was increased from 2.90 yuan to 3.50 yuan per gallon from the 4th of this month, but since yesterday it has been reduced to 3.30 yuan. Zheng Guanghe Soda Company, which had announced a 30% price increase on the 9th of this month, also announced its cancellation. It is hoped that other businesses will quickly follow suit for the sake of public welfare.</p>
<h3>All Sectors Sympathetic to Belgium's Resistance; Expressing Their Earnest Support; Fundraising to Donate Medicine for Wounded Soldiers and Refugees; Cai Shoukang and Others Plan to Visit the Belgian Ambassador</h3>
<p>Sino-Belgian relations have always been friendly. Since the mutual exchange of ambassadors, national relations have become even closer. Belgian culture developed very early and can be compared with that of China, and the progress of modern art is particularly admired by countries around the world. Therefore, the number of young Chinese students who go to Belgium to study art is no less than that of the United States, France, and other countries. Belgium has also made the greatest effort to provide aid funds and donate medicines, etc.</p>
<p>Long-Standing Friendly Relations</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Shanghai War, Belgium has begun this type of work. Two years ago, a certain director of overseas students once appealed to all sectors of Belgium for aid funds for Chinese medicine. Among them was a famous phrase: "If you plan to donate one franc to Spain, it is better to donate it to China, because donating one franc to Spain cannot save one person, but in China, it can treat five to ten people." As soon as he finished speaking, he immediately raised more than a million yuan, which shows that Belgium's substantive assistance to China is above general sympathy. After the appeal declaration issued by Ambassador Ghiolmu, all sectors in this port and the Belgian students, as well as the ambassador's friends and relatives, because of the spirit of Belgian friendship with China for decades as one day, and the current situation of China and Belgium is also the same.</p>
<p>Discussing Assistance</p>
<p>In a state of extreme difficulty, they endure fundraising to serve as medical expenses for wounded soldiers and refugees, in order to express the utmost concern of all sectors in China. It is heard that Cai Shoukang, the president of Cihui Hospital (慈惠醫院), which is organized by the Belgian Relief Association in China, and the famous sculptor Zhang Chongren (張充仁), etc., met the day before yesterday to discuss fundraising plans and agreed to visit the ambassador tomorrow to suggest a plan. If approved, they will begin to implement it. (Note: Cihui and Cih'an Hospitals were independently organized by the Belgian Relief Association in China, founded in February 1938. They are large in scale and have cost nearly one million yuan in the past three years. They accommodate Chinese civilians and are completely charitable in nature. They also have a convalescent hospital, where all seriously ill patients are treated.)</p>
<h3>Norwegian National Day Celebration; Broadcasts by Four Consuls; Consuls of France, Belgium, Netherlands, and Norway Express Confidence Together; Fighting Side-by-Side to Win the Final Victory</h3>
<p>According to the English-language *China Press*, May 17th was the 126th anniversary of the promulgation of the Norwegian constitution. Mr. Kneuchtl, the Norwegian Chargé d'Affaires in China, and his wife specially hosted Norwegian expatriates on this day at the French Ball Club, with more than 200 people in attendance, including many Norwegian ship crew members. Mr. Kneuchtl gave a speech on the spot, reviewing the recent developments in the Norwegian situation, and said that the actions of King Haakon of Norway were precedents that all patriotic Norwegians should emulate. Mr. Kneuchtl concluded by resolutely expressing the confidence of the Norwegian people in the final victory, and raised a glass to the King and the Motherland. The Norwegians present responded enthusiastically in unison.</p>
<p>Fighting Side-by-Side; Difficult Task</p>
<p>According to the *North China Daily News*, the consuls-general of France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Norway in Shanghai gave radio broadcasts to their respective expatriate communities in Shanghai and throughout China on the evening of May 17, the Norwegian National Day. First, French Consul-General Eugene gave a speech, briefly stating that he was very pleased to welcome the representatives of Norway, the Netherlands, and Belgium to speak to their expatriate communities residing in Shanghai and throughout China. At this greatest of times, the most tragic battles in history are taking place on the land, sea, and air battlefields from Norway to the Swiss border. The armies of France, Britain, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Norway, the Netherlands, and Belgium are fighting side-by-side along this vast front, bearing the difficult task of repelling the most ferocious attack the civilized world has ever seen.</p>
<p>Struggling Hard in Icy and Snowy Conditions</p>
<p>Eugene turned to Norwegian Consul Gitel and said, "In the name of the French people and myself, I express my deepest sympathy to your country. King Haakon, who is loved by the people of your country, is travelling and working hard despite his age of sixty, not losing his calmness and determination, and is setting a precedent for courage and perseverance. The great war in the territories of the Netherlands, Belgium, and France has not made us neglect the struggle of the Norwegian army in the icy and snowy conditions to cut off the enemy's route to obtaining Swedish resources."</p>
<p>Dutch Queen Is Well-Loved</p>
<p>Eugene continued by addressing Dutch Consul-General Boissevain, saying, "The succinct and resolute speech delivered yesterday by Your Majesty Queen Wilhelmina of your country deeply moved the entire world, especially the United States. We will never be conquered, and our desire to resist will never change. Your Majesty's speech and King Leopold of Belgium's words to the defending troops of Liege, 'Resist to the end to save the motherland,' will be immortalized."</p>
<p>France and Belgium Will Fight Together to the End</p>
<p>Eugene then addressed Belgian Consul-General Ksen, saying, "Our two countries' armies have fought side-by-side twice, and the cities of Liege, Namur, and Sedan have been twice ravaged. History has been repeated. Today, one week after the start of this war, the German offensive has been blocked by the steel walls of our Allied forces. Hitler will meet the same fate as Wilhelm II. We will fight to the end so that we can restore joy to the world, that is, obtain lasting peace based on freedom and civilization. Long live France, long live the Allies!"</p>
<p>Norwegian Consul Delivers a Sorrowful Speech</p>
<p>After Eugene's speech, the French national anthem was played, followed by Gitel addressing the Norwegian expatriates on land and at sea in Norwegian. After briefly describing the significance of Norwegian National Day, he said, "Today, German troops have taken control of southern and central Norway, and their actions are just as we expected. Our King recently said that what the Germans are doing in Norway is not war but massacre. The enemy's actions are inhumane. To name just a few cities that have been completely destroyed, there are Clestinsen, Molde, Elfreland, and Lillehammer, all of which have no military objectives. The Germans committed this act in Belgium during the First World War, and they have been wreaking havoc in the Netherlands and Belgium for the past few days."</p>
<p>Dutch Expatriates Firmly Believe in Final Victory</p>
<p>Next, Boissevain gave a speech, briefly describing the events after the German army began its offensive against the Netherlands on the 10th of this month, saying that the Netherlands has always aimed at peaceful development, human prosperity, and joy. Now we must not be discouraged but must strive for the future, firmly believing that the principles of justice and freedom that we cherish will ultimately prevail. We have neither lost our glory nor diminished our confidence in the slightest.</p>
<p>Appealing for Aid for the Belgian Red Cross</p>
<p>Finally, Ksen addressed the Belgian expatriates in China, saying, "Belgium is now suffering its second invasion in twenty-five years. We are reminded again of the dark times of the World War and its misery. We must now ask ourselves, are we here too far away from this terrible struggle? How should we help our compatriots who are suffering now?" Ksen concluded by appealing to Belgian friends to generously donate to the Belgian Red Cross in order to take care of the Belgian people who have been driven from their homes and displaced by the Germans' barbaric acts.</p>
<h3>Dr. Petersen Awarded by the National Government</h3>
<p>According to the English-language *China Press*, Dr. Petersen, a Danish surgeon in the Shanghai Municipal Council's Health Department, has received an award from Chongqing. The certificate was signed by Kong Xiangxi, the President of the Executive Yuan, and stated that Dr. Petersen is commended for his enthusiasm for public welfare and meritorious service in relieving suffering and providing disaster relief.</p>
<h3>Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd.</h3>
<p>Vitamins are an indispensable product for human life. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd. of Switzerland was the first large-scale manufacturer of various vitamins. The company was founded in 1896 and has been in business for more than forty years. Its manufacturing policy focuses on excellent quality and meeting standards. All those in the medical field know this.

<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council's Civil Service Commission Considers Employee Benefits; Salary and Pension Issues Discussed at Yesterday's Meeting</h3>
<p>According to the *Shanghai Times*, the newly established Civil Service Commission of the Shanghai Municipal Council held a meeting on Thursday afternoon in the Municipal Council Building. It was heard that the meeting discussed the salary issue of the Municipal Council employees and suggestions for revising the rules for receiving pensions. Although the Bureau</p>
<p>Made No Announcement</p>
<p>It was heard that the Commission has taken into consideration the recent increase in the level of living and has decided to submit its recommendations to the Finance Committee. A week ago, it was rumored that the salaries of Municipal Council employees would continue to increase by 20 to 25 percent. However, it is not yet known</p>
<p>What Other Resolutions Have Been Agreed Upon</p>
<p>In addition to submitting its recommendations, the Finance Committee, after giving it due consideration, will submit it to the Municipal Council for final approval. In view of the daily increase in prices, it is expected that the relevant committees will expedite its implementation.</p>
<h3>Speculators' Unprecedented Misfortune; U.S. Goods Plummet in Price; Stocks Plunge Sharply; Speculative Losses Exceed 20 Million</h3>
<p>The major speculators in this port who hoard goods have now encountered a bitter and serious blow. The magnitude of their losses is truly only seen in every financial upheaval in Shanghai. According to a reporter from Pingming News Agency who inquired with authorities in import and export trade in this port, since the Shanghai War, general and larger speculators have hoarded European and American goods. Soon after, with the outbreak of the European war, they again regarded hoarding American goods as the only reliable way</p>
<p>To Get Rich Quickly</p>
<p>But unexpectedly, in the United States, the prices of various goods, whether they are piece goods, rubber, cotton yarn, or other raw materials or finished products, have all plummeted to unprecedented levels. In addition, American stocks have also plunged sharply. Therefore, the market prices of all American goods have fallen across the board. According to estimates from foreign businesses in this port, as of the day before yesterday (the 17th), the losses incurred by powerful speculators in Shanghai will amount to between 20 million and 30 million yuan, at the very least exceeding 20 million yuan. Furthermore, due to the depreciation of U.S. goods, all other goods in this port, whether they are European goods or other foreign goods, or even Chinese native goods, have been affected by this and all without exception</p>
<p>Followed Suit in Declining</p>
<p>Therefore, all those in Shanghai who speculate by hoarding goods, whether large or small, have suffered heavy losses. This is truly another unexpected and serious blow to speculators in this port during this sharp rebound of the black market exchange rate. Those engaged in hoarding should be aware that the amount of goods hoarded in the two concessions of Shanghai is truly unprecedented. Not only are the customs warehouses piled up and empty, but even after the Jianghai Customs repeatedly urged them to clear the goods, they were ultimately unable to leave the warehouses due to sluggish sales. In addition, all other bank warehouses are also full to the brim. Therefore, although most speculators are still reluctant to sell off their stocks at a loss, it is ultimately difficult to maintain the situation and they will inevitably suffer even greater losses. This is the inevitable result.</p>
<h3>Strictly Prevent Speculation and Eliminate Arbitrage; Adopt an Appropriate Level; Maintain the Commercial Interests of Friendly Nations; Maintain Sufficient Funds and Consolidate the Strength of the Legal Tender</h3>
<p>After the Shanghai black market exchange rate sharply contracted from the 1st, the shrinking trend was very strong in a few days. Speculators took the opportunity to stir up trouble, and the ignorant masses were worried. However, the tendency of the exchange rate to increase in the past week proves that this contraction was a planned operation and not an indication of insufficient legal tender strength. As for the Chinese government, in order to safeguard the commercial interests of all friendly nations, it continues to maintain the rate at the expense of huge losses. However, from an operational standpoint, the previous level was too high, so the exchange rate had to be gradually reduced to find an appropriate level.</p>
<p>Friendly Nations' Understanding</p>
<p>The government has long been determined to stabilize foreign exchange, maintain currency credibility, and stabilize finance. However, in order to prevent the activities of speculators in Shanghai, financial institutions have adopted a cautious approach to lending, raising all interest rates to make speculation unprofitable. Moreover, certain parties are constantly exchanging legal tender to arbitrage foreign exchange. Maintaining high exchange rates would fall into their trap. Therefore, the Exchange Equalization Fund Committee has adopted an appropriate level, which has been understood by people from various friendly nations. The so-called depletion of the exchange fund is completely unfounded. In fact, the fund balance is still abundant, amounting to three to four million pounds.</p>
<p>Foreign Exchange Abundance</p>
<p>Since the German invasion of the Netherlands and Belgium, the financial institutions of the Netherlands and Belgium in China have been affected, and their credit has shown signs of wavering. In order to cope with the withdrawal of deposits by depositors, the banks had to dispose of all their foreign exchange. Therefore, the changes in the Shanghai foreign exchange market on the 11th were completely unexpected. At the same time, the Dutch East Indies was uneasy due to the invasion of the Netherlands. Overseas Chinese residing there remitted more money back to China to ensure safety in preparation for possible dangers and strict exchange control. Among them, the most flowed into Shanghai. The amount of this remittance was quite large, so the exchange rate's rise was natural.</p>
<p>Gradually Stabilizing</p>
<p>China's foreign trade has improved after adjustment. According to the customs report, in the first quarter of this year, foreign trade had a surplus of 21.39 million yuan. Moreover, the European war is brewing major changes, and there may be unexpected developments in foreign trade in the future. Therefore, the exchange market can be stabilized without external force. The Shanghai exchange market will inevitably find a phenomenon of oversupply, which will cause the legal tender exchange rate to rise. It is also heard that the Exchange Equalization Fund Committee will, in order to maintain the current level for a long time, buy foreign exchange from the market when necessary to replenish the fund, so that the fund is sufficient and the currency is credible.</p>
<h3>Zhou Junchang and Gu Pengcheng Were Suddenly Kidnapped Yesterday Morning; They Encountered Bandits in the Suburbs of Shanghai; The Police are Investigating and Rescuing Them</h3>
<p>At about 8:30 yesterday morning, at the north end of the railway on Route Ghisi, west of Shanghai, a well-known German doctor, Zhou Junchang, a construction engineer, Gu Pengcheng, and a groom were riding horses in the suburbs. When they passed by that place, six bandits suddenly jumped out from the side of the road, threatening and intimidating them with guns, and immediately kidnapped them. They took Zhou and the others into a car parked on Route Ghisi and sped away towards the Chinese area.</p>
<p>Kidnapped by Bandits</p>
<p>At this time of early summer, Chinese and Western ladies in Shanghai like to ride horses in the suburbs every morning. Zhou Junchang, a German doctor, and Gu Pengcheng, a construction engineer, met because of seeing a doctor, and their friendship became very deep. They often rode horses together on various roads in western Shanghai. At 5:45 yesterday morning, Zhou hired a car to Gu's residence (address below) and took Gu's own light green car, number 7302, driven by Gu himself, to a stable on Yuyuan Road, where they boarded their horses and galloped west. A groom followed. When they arrived at Route Ghisi, the north end of the railway on Route Ghisi, six bandits suddenly jumped out from the side of the road, all holding pistols, prohibiting any noise. They forcibly dragged the three of them into a car of a certain number on the side of the road and fled towards the Chinese area. Afterwards, another Westerner riding a horse witnessed everything. He knew both Zhou and Gu, so Gu Pengcheng used English to notify the Westerner and asked him to drive his car, number 7302, home and notify his family. Later, Gu's wife relayed the above to Zhou's house and reported it to the Jing'an Temple Police Station. The police are now investigating and rescuing them, and they must solve the case and bring the perpetrators to justice.</p>

<h3>Night Soil Workers Resumed Work Yesterday; The Strike Wave Has Completely Subsided; Accumulated Dirt and Filth are Actively Removed</h3>
<p>The road workers, sewer workers, transportation workers, garbage workers, and street cleaners of the Public Works Department of the Municipal Council requested an increase in wages, resulting in a strike wave. After mediation and resolution, the workers first resumed work the day before yesterday, and the night soil workers also accepted the persuasion of the Political Department and announced their resumption of work yesterday morning. As a result, the strike wave, which had been deadlocked for a week, completely subsided. The garbage and feces accumulated during the strike period have been actively removed by the Public Works Department, which has urged garbage workers, sewer workers, and street cleaners to actively remove them separately. The Public Works Department stipulates that all garbage accumulated in the alleys shall be the responsibility of the garbage workers to sweep away, and the garbage on the roads and in the vegetable markets shall be cleared by the Public Works Department sending vehicles separately, in order to speed up the process.

<h3>Chartering Case Loss - Tongsheng Company Lost the Case; The Defendant Was Ordered to Compensate the Full Amount</h3>
<p>Zeng Bingsen, a Fujianese who once served as a naval captain, opened the Tongsheng Shipping Company in partnership in March of last year. He chartered the Norwegian merchant ship Landi through Taichangxiang Shipping Company, No. 6 Jiqingli, Sanyangjingqiao, at a monthly rent of 887 pounds and 10 shillings. At that time, the charter was signed for a period of one year. However, it was not long before the Tongsheng Company said it had:</p>
<p>Lost all its capital</p>
<p>and requested to return the ship. However, Taichangxiang believed that the company had violated the charter agreement, so the legal representative of the company, Han Jinhua, hired lawyer Jiang Yiping to file a lawsuit against the shareholders of Tongsheng Company - Zeng Bingsen, Zeng Yiping, Huang Siku, Dai Wenlin, Chen Shaoji, Yao Yongwen, Zeng Nianci, Liu Nianhua, Zeng Jizhi, Chen Xiaozeng, Liu Ganrong, and Yao Shoumin - in the Civil Division of the Second Special Court for violating the chartering agreement. Judge Chen Can:</p>
<p>Held several hearings</p>
<p>to hear the case. Among the defendants, Chen Shaoji hired lawyer Zhang Danping, and Zeng Jizhi and Huang Ruku hired lawyer Ma Shouhua as agents to appear in court and submit counter-evidence, claiming that they had withdrawn from the partnership. The remaining defendants failed to appear in court throughout the proceedings. In the end, due to the complexity of the situation, after more than half a year: Yesterday, the judgment was announced. In Chinese, it stated that Zeng Bingsen, Zeng Yiping, Liu Zhenhui, Liu Mengxian, and Wang Wei should:</p>
<p>Jointly and severally compensate</p>
<p>the plaintiff 943 pounds, 12 shillings, and 6 pence, as well as 73,365 yuan and 0.01 yuan in national currency, plus statutory interest calculated at a weekly rate of 5% from the date of filing the lawsuit to the date of execution. The litigation costs, excluding the defendants Zeng Jizhi, Chen Shaoji, Huang Ruku, Yao Rongwen, and Dai Wenlin, shall be borne by the defendant; the remaining expenses shall be borne jointly and severally by the defendants Zeng Bingsen, et al.</p>
<h3>Three Sisters Were Injured in a Car Accident; They Sued for Damages; Driving Without a License Caused a Public Prosecution</h3>
<p>Bai Lancun (26 years old), Bai Meicun (24 years old), and Bai Xiecun (18 years old), three sisters from Hubei who live at No. 12 Zhilanfang, Route Ghisi, west of the Eight Immortals Bridge in the French Concession, all work as dancers at the Paramount Ballroom on Route Bingyuan in western Shanghai. On March 11, at 8:00 p.m., the three sisters hired rickshaws pulled by Shen Linhua, Ji Aixian, and Liu Guojun, all from Jiangbei:</p>
<p>to go to the Paramount</p>
<p>Ballroom for dancing. When they passed the intersection of Route Fuxi and Route Shengmuyuan, Xin Hongbin (23 years old, from Shandong), a copper worker from the British-owned China General Omnibus Company, drove a bus that had just been repaired from the bus factory at No. 1171 Kangnaodao:</p>
<p>out for a test drive.</p>
<p>When he drove to the intersection of Route Fuxi and Route Shengmuyuan, he was speeding west and in the same direction as the three rickshaws, from east to west, behind the rickshaws,</p>
<p>unable to brake</p>
<p>to avoid them, causing the three rickshaws carrying the Bai sisters to be hit. All three Bai sisters fell out of the rickshaws and were injured. Patrolman No. 542 investigated and found that he sent the injured women to the Guangci Hospital for treatment, and at the same time took Xin Hongbin to the French Concession Police Station to await investigation and handling. Now that the three Bai sisters have been treated in the hospital and have been healed for two months, the police sent the defendant Xin Hongbin to the Eighth Division of the Second Special Court the day before yesterday. Police lawyer Yao Zhaodi stated the case, saying that the defendant:</p>
<p>drove without a license</p>
<p>and caused the accident. He is now prosecuting him for negligent injury and violating traffic regulations in accordance with Article 284 of the Criminal Code, and requesting that he be investigated and punished according to law. The victims, i.e., the plaintiffs, the Bai sisters, were accompanied by their father, Bai Huasan (60 years old), and hired lawyers Playfair and Ai Zhenlin as agents to request incidental civil proceedings, seeking to recover damages, medical expenses, and lost business due to injury, and requesting that the defendant be ordered to compensate Bai Lancun for 1,500 yuan, Bai Meicun for 5,000 yuan (due to:</p>
<p>scars on the face</p>
<p>that cannot be treated and restored), and Bai Xuecun for 2,000 yuan. The defendant Xin Hongbin hired lawyers Fan and Yu Enliang to defend him, admitting that he did not have a driver's license and was driving the car out for a test drive when he accidentally caused the accident. After Judge Ai Xiaogen verified the confession, he ordered the defendant to post bail and adjourned the hearing to a later date after the victim's injury.</p>
<h3>A Young Crazy Woman Acts Up in the Downtown Area and Obstructs the Trolleybus with a Prank</h3>
<p>At around 6:00 last night, in front of the Dashin Company at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Yu Qiaqing Road, there was a young and beautiful crazy woman acting up. She was holding a two-month-old girl in her arms and wandering in the middle of the road. At first, she murmured softly, and then she put the child on the main road. When a trolleybus of a certain number arrived, she deliberately pulled down the trolley pole (commonly known as "tou er ling") from behind, making the bus unable to move. She did this two or three times, laughing wildly. Later, passers-by gathered and saw that she had a beautiful face and clean clothes, and was not a beggar. However, when asked repeatedly, she spoke incoherently and did not know what she was talking about. Later, as more and more people gathered to watch, the patrolmen arrived and drove her away. She then walked north alone. (Huaguang News Agency)</p>
<h3>Residents of the Gu Ba Xin Cun Oppose the Order to Vacate</h3>
<p>The Gu Ba Xin Cun on Gu Ba Road is owned by Guangxin Company. There are more than 40 houses, including shops and apartments, totaling no less than 90 units. Before the war, less than one-third of them were rented out. After August 13, the Real Estate Department of the Four Banks Trust, which managed the village, repeatedly increased rents. Last November, the tenants negotiated with Zhu Zhichao, the representative of the Real Estate Department of the bank, and agreed on three conditions: (1) Each tenant would be given an additional rent of 15 yuan per house; (2) A painting fee of 60 yuan will be given with each contract; (3) After the expiration of the contract, each tenant can continue to enjoy this right. In order to protect the interests of the tenants, contracts can be prepaid in accordance with the above conditions. Unexpectedly, the above regulations were agreed upon at the end of last year. In May of this year, the owner suddenly entrusted the management of the village to the business firm Rouyi Shi. According to the announcement of the firm, it has been entrusted by the owner to sell the houses in the village in separate units, and ordered the tenants to vacate the houses within a time limit. More than 90 tenants unanimously and firmly opposed this announcement, argued reasonably, and absolutely refused to move out, and would not stop until the owner withdrew the original proposal.</p>
<h3>Unemployed Messengers Punished for Impersonating and Deceiving</h3>
<p>Xu Wenming, Yao Xueqing, Xu Yeming, and other messengers from the former Nanshi China Telegraph Bureau, became unemployed after the war. Recently, due to extreme poverty, they each wore messenger uniforms and carried donation books to solicit donations from all walks of life. At noon the day before yesterday, Xu and others again solicited 2 yuan from a Western employee of the Public Works Bureau Health Department at No. 1221 Lane 1, Route Avenue Edward VII, but the employee, Truellet, found out after returning home that these people were soliciting donations under false names, which was close to fraud. He reported it to the police, who sent detectives to arrest Xu and the other three, and confiscated two donation books and 17.5 yuan in banknotes, and took them to the police station. Yesterday morning, the police handed them over to the Criminal Division 8 of the First Special Court. The police lawyer, Fang Fushu, filed a lawsuit according to law. Judge Zhong interrogated them and sentenced Xu and the other three to a fine of 30 yuan each, and the donation books were confiscated. Tong Jiajun, the eldest son of Tong Zhongyi, a well-known martial arts master and trauma expert, held a wedding ceremony with Ms. Yuan Xiuying, the daughter of Yuan Ruiting, a prominent family from Cangxian, Hebei, yesterday at the Huibinlou Restaurant. The wedding officiant was the famous lawyer Tang Hao, and more than 500 people from the Shanghai gentry and business circles attended to congratulate them. The guests gathered together, which was a grand occasion for a time.</p>
<h3>A Public Bus Kills a Six-Year-Old Girl</h3>
<p>Hu Fanglin, the six-year-old daughter of Hu Zuchang (38 years old, from Wuxi), who lives at No. 28 Tongdeli, No. 223 Route Fuxi, was crossing the road from south to north at the gate of No. 213 Route Fuxi at nearly 11:00 a.m. the day before yesterday. A French-owned bus F824 of Route 22, driven by bus driver Li Jingui, was speeding from east to west. The girl could not avoid it and was hit and injured in the head, and died instantly. The patrolman inspected and copied the number, and sent the child's body to the Tongren Fuyuantang Examination Office. He reported it to the patrolman. Yesterday, the police reported to Zhao Changmin, the prosecutor of the Second Special Court, to inspect the body and confirm that she died from being hit. After questioning the defendant about what happened, he ordered the father of the corpse to sign a bond to claim the corpse, and the defendant was handed over to the court by the police department for prosecution.</p>

<h3>Finance: Foreign Exchange Buying Momentum Weakened</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market, HSBC's listing showed no ups and downs. The dark market for British and American exchange was quieter than before. However, due to unfavorable news for buyers, such as Italy's participation in the war, speculators disappeared. External investors were less active, and the momentum waned. There was no rebound. As for the trading process, the morning started with a sharp contraction in the exchange rate, and the US exchange rate was tight at the opening. However, Chinese speculators soon began to sell, followed by Japanese banks appearing with spot goods, dropping into forward contracts. American banks also showed a willingness to sell and sold up to 20,000 pounds of spot shillings, with loose prices emerging one after another. Therefore, by noon, spot British gold at 4 1/125 pence was relatively easy to close. As a result, British gold was quoted at 4.109375 pence and the US exchange rate was 5.53125 yuan, with the former rising by 0.078125 and the latter slightly hardening by 0.0625 compared to the previous close. The forward contract weakened more than the spot market, so the price difference between the current month's forward contract and the spot price was close.</p>
<p>Japanese Banks Still Appeared with Spot Goods</p>
<p>In the morning, London's large transactions nearly fell by 3.125, New York's silver price remained flat, and London's raw gold was stable. The exchange rate between British and American dollars remained unchanged, with an increase of 0.0625 against Shanghai, and the same against France. The US dollar rose by 10 cents against Shanghai and slightly less than 3.25 cents against France. The central bank's listed exchange rates remained the same. The banks opened in the morning with spot selling prices of 4.03125 pence for British gold and 5.375 yuan for the US exchange rate, which was flat for British gold and tight for US exchange rate by 0.09375 compared to the previous day's closing, due to the sharp decline in the exchange rate. After the opening, the market was quite hardened due to the jamming of Chinese speculators. It is estimated that Chinese speculators sold US exchange rates to foreign banks for May at 5.375 yuan. HSBC's listing was announced without any changes. The balance tax on silver was announced without any increase or decrease. The trend remained loose afterwards, because Japanese and American banks were willing to sell, while foreign banks' appetite remained weak. The Japanese bank appeared with US exchange rates for foreign banks at 5.5625 yuan. However, after accepting the orders, a certain American bank transferred 20,000 pounds of spot British gold to HSBC and Macalli at a price of 4.125 pence, as it did not have a large amount of legal tender. By the time the noon market closed, there were few changes. As a result, British gold was 4.109375 pence and US exchange rate was 5.53125 yuan. May's British gold was 4.0625 pence and the US exchange rate was 5.4375 yuan. June's British gold was 3.90625 pence and the US exchange rate was 5.1875 yuan, with spot goods rising by 0.078125 for British gold and hardening by 0.0625 for the US exchange rate compared to the closing price yesterday. The May and June futures each weakened by 0.15625 and the US also weakened by 0.125. There was no market on Saturday afternoon.</p>
<p>Hong Kong's US Exchange Rate Fluctuated</p>
<p>Hong Kong, 18th (Saturday) - The exchange market opened with turbulence this morning. British exchange spot and futures both stood at the original level.

<p>Tianjin British Flat, US Tight</p>
<p>Tianjin, 18th (Saturday) - The exchange market opened weakly this morning. British exchange spot was unchanged, still standing at 3.6875 pence. US exchange spot was tighter by 0.125 compared to yesterday's opening, at 4.875 yuan. Shanghai exchange rose by half a yuan, to 110 yuan and 50 cents. The "United Note" dark market rose by 1.5 yuan, to 100 yuan.</p>
<h3>Foreign Currencies Continue to Decline</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market was boosted by the sharp fall of the US stock index in New York by six yuan, the breakthrough of the Maginot Line by the German army, and the fact that the atmosphere of Italy's participation in the war has not disappeared. All of these were sufficient to boost selling sentiment. US dollar bills initially fell by 5.5 points against the pound price. In the morning, it briefly rose to 18 yuan and 40 cents, but then immediately fell, and after the morning close, it retreated to 17 yuan and 60 cents, eventually reaching 17 yuan and 75 cents, which was still a drop of 40 cents compared to the previous day. The supply of British gold bills was also smooth, and the market price was very soft. British and American gold pounds followed the price of gold and fell. Hong Kong bills followed the trend of lower exchange rates between Hong Kong and Shanghai. French franc bills and Singapore Philippine bills also became weak. There was a sudden supply of Japanese gold bills, with an evening wave of 2.14 yuan. The supply and demand of Korean bills were still uniform, with the evening price still at 92 cents.</p>
<h3>Discount Rate Squeezed by Three Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday's exchange bill discount rate was stable with a slight decline, ranging from 115 yuan to 120 yuan per 1,000 yuan, with a final rate of 112 yuan, squeezed by 3 yuan. The Money Dealers Association's lending rate was quoted at 21 cents in both the morning and afternoon markets, a drop of one cent.</p>
<h3>Although Fluctuations Narrow, Gold Market Still Unable to Escape Downtrend</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the spot gold bullion (shā chì) grey market saw calmer conditions, with the range of fluctuations gradually narrowing. However, conflicting rumors regarding positive and negative news persisted, and the weakening of foreign exchange rates further suppressed any upward movement. Consequently, prices fell by over one hundred yuan. The market opened at 5,900 yuan amidst selling pressure, exacerbated by active selling from banks, driving the price down to 5,850 yuan. However, after a short period, securities firms, money exchange businesses, and gold shops collectively engaged in purchasing, briefly pushing the price up to 5,950 yuan. Ultimately, due to retail investors taking the opportunity to sell off their holdings and banks selling short at the higher price, the market was quickly pushed down to a low of 5,810 yuan for the day. Before the market closed, short positions were covered, leading to a rebound to 5,900 yuan. However, the prevailing pessimistic sentiment led to a final close at 5,865 yuan, a decrease of 105 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price. Trading volume fluctuated between periods of quiet and activity, totaling approximately two thousand taels. Gold jewelry prices at jewelry stores decreased by ten yuan. Prices for customs gold remained stable.</p>
<p>Bullion Further Declines by One Hundred Yuan</p>
<p>From early morning, even though exchange rates initially showed a sharp decline, the U.S. dollar quickly rebounded, and the British pound weakened against the U.S. dollar, leading to pessimistic sentiment. Initially, gold shops offered ten taels of gold at 5,900 yuan, a decrease of seventy yuan from the previous day. Subsequently, due to one bank's inclination to sell off holdings and a lack of buyers, prices were further suppressed by fifty yuan. One bank, along with jewelry shops and other businesses, offered a total of thirty taels at 5,850 yuan. Then, a money exchange business suddenly made a large purchase, and a securities firm also showed strong buying appetite, while sellers gradually decreased. Prices soon rebounded by one hundred yuan, with the money exchange business trading fifty taels at 5,950 yuan. However, with the exchange rate still weakening, it was inevitable that those who had accumulated at high prices would sell off. Shortly after, the market briefly reached the 5,900 yuan mark. At that time, one bank resumed selling, and another bank followed suit, pushing the price down again by ninety yuan. Money exchange businesses traded ten taels at 5,810 yuan. Later, as selling pressure subsided, prices rebounded again, with banks and retail investors covering short positions. With fewer sellers, prices were pushed up by several tens of yuan, with banks and gold shops trading sixty taels at 5,900 yuan. As the market approached closing, buyers decreased, and prices declined again. Banks sold sixty taels to securities firms and money exchange businesses at 5,865 yuan as the afternoon closing price, resulting in a decrease of 105 yuan compared to the previous day. The price fluctuated by one hundred and forty yuan throughout the half-day. The selling price of gold by cash shops, based on the bullion price, was ten yuan higher. The purchasing price was thirty yuan lower. The actual price of standard gold was over fifty yuan lower than the listed price, and transactions were infrequent.</p>
<p>Jewelry Prices Decrease by Ten Yuan</p>
<p>The initial asking price for gold jewelry at jewelry stores was 610 yuan per tael at major stores. However, at 10:35 AM, prices decreased by ten yuan, and remained unchanged afterwards. As a result, major stores revised their prices to 600 yuan, while new stores maintained the same price. Purchasing prices were reduced by approximately thirty yuan.</p>
<h3>British and Indian Silver Prices Decline</h3>
<p>London, 17th: The large bar silver market is nearly flat, with a slight decrease of 3125. After widespread purchasing, there is satisfaction. Speculators are selling forward contracts, and the market is flat. After the market closes, there are buyers at the listed price, while sellers are taking a wait-and-see approach. New York: Both spot and forward prices for American silver are flat. Bombay: Spot and forward prices for Indian silver have both decreased by a small amount, 7 annas. The market is flat, with a total of 100 contracts traded.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton Fluctuate Significantly, Not Yet Fully Stabilized</h3>
<p>The yarn market, which has seen wild up-and-down swings in recent days, has now become more stable. The overall trend, however, remains weak. This is because previous prices were pushed too high, and the subsequent correction has been a sharp decline. Many speculative positions remain unresolved, so the speculative mood has not subsided. The market continues to move towards weakness. Therefore, it is difficult to expect an upturn in the near term.</p>
<p>The spot yarn market opened this morning with neutral sentiment, and the market was calm. The spot price for 20-count Double Horse yarn was 1,335 yuan, rising slightly to 1,345 yuan. Then, news of liquidation of long positions and weakening exchange rates led to a decline to 1,310 yuan. Shortly after, reports of slight demand from Guangdong merchants pushed the price up again to 1,327 yuan. However, after the market closed, the continued weakening of exchange rates led to another decline. The total transaction volume for the half-day was 1,602 bales. 1,690 pieces of yarn will be shipped to Hong Kong on the 19th. The quantity purchased by each group is listed below:</p>
<p>Hong Kong 500, Other Merchants 990</p>
<p>Yunnan 12, Total 1,601</p>
<h3>Spot Cotton Trading Stagnates</h3>
<p>Spot cotton trading has completely come to a standstill. This is because the European war is becoming increasingly chaotic, leading to uncertain sentiment. As a result, there is no trading activity.</p>
<p>Another report: The price of foreign cotton. The New York cotton market was initially strong, but later the market became panicked. The sharp decline in stock prices on Wall Street had a significant impact on commodity prices, and the closing price of cotton fell by more than 20 points yesterday. The Indian cotton market is remarkably stable, rising 8 or 9 rupees compared to the previous day, but the projected sharp decline is 14 rupees, so the net drop is 6 rupees compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>The increasing volatility of the Shanghai foreign cotton market has led to a sharp decline in trading by foreign firms. The inventory in the market is scarce, so the selling price of raw cotton in Shanghai is not affected by overseas cotton markets. The general consensus is that transportation difficulties will cause cotton prices to rise in the future. This may be true. The delivered factory price of U.S. cotton futures yesterday, based on an exchange rate of 5.375 U.S. dollars, is as follows:</p>
<p>20-count U.S. Middling 341.80</p>
<p>20-count, Lower Grade 232.10</p>
<p>22-count, 365.50</p>
<p>30-count, Lower Grade 357.20</p>
<p>42-count, 369.90</p>
<p>42-count, Lower Grade 358.50</p>
<h3>Grain: Rice Market Slightly Declines, Flour Market Flat</h3>
<p>The rice market ended with a decline of between half a yuan and a yuan. Sellers initially wanted to raise prices, but buyers were hesitant, leading to a weakening trend. Prices for all grades of rice fell by half a yuan. For example, No. 1 old Saigon rice opened at 50.05 yuan, No. 2 at 48.5 yuan, and Small Jia at 47 yuan. As prices fell, speculators suddenly absorbed supply. The price of Small Jia was like a ball, and the Small Jia price quickly returned to 47.8 yuan. However, other Saigon grades, because of lack of trading interest and sluggish actual sales, did not move and remained flat. No. 2 Siam was unpopular, feeling even more sluggish. Small Jia was also difficult to hold for long, and prices quickly declined for all grades. At the close, the prices for all grades were: Small Jia at 47 yuan, No. 2 Saigon 48 yuan, 47.5 yuan, Fire Pattern 49 yuan, 48.5 yuan, a decline of half a yuan from before. No. 1 old Saigon, because it was affected by the sluggishness of domestic rice, decreased by about one yuan, to 50 yuan, 49.5 yuan. No. 2 Siam was only 46.7 yuan, 46.5 yuan.</p>
<p>Speculative trading in foreign rice has not disappeared completely. Market prices fluctuate, with swings of more than half a yuan. The market was flat in the morning, rebounded at noon, and then fell again in the afternoon. Small Jia opened at 47 yuan in the morning, rising to 47.78 yuan, but then fell from 47.5 yuan to 47 yuan in the afternoon. The final closing price was 47.2 yuan. Saigon and Siam had less fluctuation, and both ended weaker by 45 points and 67 points from the previous day. There was no trading of British and Chinese companies, and Ningbo and other buyer groups did not inquire today due to the weekend.</p>
<p>Domestic rice, such as thick and thin japonica varieties, has continued to arrive in large quantities, 2,000 to 3,000 bags each day. With the arrival of the mildew season, the quality of the rice is easily degraded, so rumors are circulating in the off-market grey market. Sentiment is weak, holders are eager to sell, and buyers are reluctant to buy, resulting in limited trading activity. Selling prices have fallen by more than one yuan. Wuxi Special Clean japonica is 51 yuan to 50 yuan, Powder japonica is 48.9 yuan, Chang Kun japonica is around 50 yuan, but those with heat damage are only 46.7 yuan, Qing Si Thin Rice is 48.9 yuan, or 47 yuan, and Nan Gang early rice is 46.7 yuan. The supply of glutinous rice is limited, but sales are strong due to the approaching Dragon Boat Festival, both retail and wholesale. Therefore, the market is not affected by japonica and indica rice, and is uniquely tight, with prices increasing by half a yuan. Jin Li Special Yuan sells for 44 yuan retail, and Chang Dan goods also require 42.3 yuan.</p>
<p>Trading of spot flour is even quieter. Actual sales in the local market have gradually decreased since the dumping of domestic flour. Customer sales were active once before, but now have become quiet again, so the market is unusually quiet. Although the prices of No. 2 flour mills have not changed, the return cargo of the Old Car brand at 13.9 yuan still lacks buyers. Domestic flour such as Shun Feng and Shan Lu brands is only 13.5 yuan and also has no formal sales. Apart from the thousands of bags sold by factories, the rest is being withheld. Also, 9,300 bags of flour (19th) were shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Wheat trading has been quiet for a long time. New wheat in various regions is already being harvested, and new wheat should be on the market in early June.</p>
<h3>Securities: Domestic Bonds Slightly Rebound, Far East Stocks All Decline</h3>
<p>The securities grey market yesterday shifted from sluggish to slightly firmer. Rumors about peace and treasury bonds were proven false. Yesterday, Jiufeng consistently covered short positions, and Defu was actively taking long positions. Lianhe also bought a lot. Tongkang, Hongda, Hongkang, and No. 64 all had buying interest in varying degrees. Yongkang and Yitai sold in the morning and afternoon. Xieda and Lianyi were also inclined to sell. With buyers being more aggressive, the situation was relatively better. Market prices ended with gains of 1.5 to 3 points for most, except for those that failed to open in the afternoon, which were slightly down by 5 points. The total value of transactions was over 700,000 yuan. A simplified table is listed below:</p>
<p>Category Highest Lowest Closing Compared to Previous Day</p>
<p>Unified A 59.90 59.50 59.90 Up 0.30</p>
<p>Unified B 51.60 51.25 51.60 Down 0.20</p>
<p>Unified C 49.60 49.25 49.60 Up 0.15</p>
<p>Unified D 48.2 - 48.25 Up 0.05</p>
<p>Unified E 50.05 49.80 50.05 Up 0.15</p>
<p>In stock trading, 40 shares of Zhendai Yarn Mill were traded at a price of 88 yuan.</p>
<p>The British Shanghai Waterworks Company Limited's annual shareholders' meeting is scheduled to be held at the company in this city on June 12th at noon. A dividend of one cent per week for 1939 is proposed.</p>
<p>London, 17th (Friday): Today's listed prices for British Far East companies' stocks showed a general decline in bank stocks. Mercantile Bank shares fell 5 shillings to £8 15 shillings. HSBC Bank's London-registered shares fell £6 to £80, and Hong Kong-registered shares fell £4.5 to £82. Chartered Bank shares fell 5 shillings to £12 5 shillings. However, Colacre Rubber shares continued to rebound, rising 1.5 pence to 18 shillings 1.5 pence. The rest remained unchanged.</p>
<p>London, 17th (Friday): Today's listed prices for Chinese foreign bonds remained stable. There were no changes in any bonds up or down.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Textile Declares Dividend of 7.5 Yuan</h3>
<p>The net profit of Nisshin Shanghai Textile Co., Ltd. for the 34th term (i.e., the half-year ending April 1940) was 6.84 million Japanese yen. Together with the retained earnings from the previous term, the total was over 8.75 million Japanese yen. It is proposed to pay a dividend of 5 Japanese yen per share and a bonus of 2.5 Japanese yen per share, for a total of 7.5 Japanese yen. The shareholders' meeting is scheduled to be held on May 16th.</p>
<p>Anglo-Japanese Iron &amp; Steel Co., Ltd. will hold its annual shareholders' meeting on May 31st. It is proposed to pay a dividend of 3 National Currency yuan per share for 1939.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Grains: Extremely Limited Soybean Arrivals</h3>
<p>Yesterday's soybean market was weak due to a sharp drop of 2 to 3 yuan in soybean oil, resulting in a lack of buying interest. Only scattered sales in the local market were recorded, totaling 300 bags of Wuhu beans at a price of 23 yuan to 12 yuan, 700 bags of Anqing beans at a price of 13.7 yuan to 23.3 yuan, 100 bags of Sangyuan beans at a price of 21.7 yuan, and 30 bags of Pudong green soybeans at a price of 24 yuan.</p>
<h3>Coal: Coal Briquettes at 8.2 Yuan</h3>
<p>Coal briquette prices, since the shilling rebounded, have fallen from a high of 9.4 yuan per dan at retail shops to 8.4 yuan. Factory prices have also quickly decreased twice, reducing the price by 18 yuan. Yesterday, due to the continued weakening of the shilling, the company decided to further reduce factory prices by 4 yuan. The prices for deliveries by fellow traders from their own vehicles are 252 yuan, with an additional charge for delivery. The prices at local retail shops are 20.05 yuan per basket, or 8.2 yuan per dan.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Cloth Sales Uniquely Strong</h3>
<p>Domestic Cloth: Yesterday's market decline gradually eased, as both actual sales and new hoarders stepped in to purchase. However, due to nervous sentiment, most selling offers were tight on the surface but loose in reality, and actual transaction prices were lower than market offers, creating much confusion. However, actual sales of coarse cloth were uniquely strong, and prices were also the most firm. The price of each type of goods from the British Lun Chang factory has remained firm this week, but hand goods have fallen across the board. Yesterday, the factory price of Entertainment Floral Cloth alone fell by 3 yuan. Local sales included over 300 bags of Yihe coarse cloth, over 100 bags of fine cloth and fine twill. Ningbo and Taizhou buyers purchased two to three hundred pieces of coarse cloth, twill, colored cloth, and colored twill. Guangdong buyers purchased over one hundred pieces of colored cloth and colored twill.</p>
<p>Eastern Cloth: Yesterday's market rose and fell abruptly, slightly shifting from weak to firm. The opening price of Dragon Head fine cloth fell from 44 yuan to 43 yuan, then rebounded to 44.5 yuan in the afternoon. Market sentiment was quite good, with asking prices reaching 45 yuan. However, with actual sales remaining sluggish and fellow traders selling off, the price fell to 43.75 yuan at closing, an increase of 7.5 points from the previous day. Mid-range miscellaneous brand fine cloth remained between 45 and 46 yuan. It is said that fellow traders still have many hand goods in stock this month, so optimism is unwarranted. The closing price of Four Gentlemen Thousand Serge was 1.255 yuan per yard, increasing to 1.28 yuan this month, also rebounding by 3 points.</p>
<p>Exports: 10 pieces of piece goods will be shipped to Turkey today (19th), and another 80 pieces will be shipped to Siam.</p>
<h3>Baleni Cloth Sells Well</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Saturday, the woolen cloth market remained extremely tight. Baleni cloth was in high demand among native buyers, with both striped and solid colors selling well. Due to the lack of new arrivals, the market is increasingly bullish. Yesterday, the wholesale selling price of British-made No. 1 Baleni cloth in various colors was 32 to 33 yuan per yard, No. 2 was 27 to 28 yuan, and No. 3 was 21 to 22 yuan. Eastern goods No. 1 sold for 23 to 24 yuan, No. 2 for 18 to 19 yuan, and No. 3 for 15 to 16 yuan. Shanghai Textile's own goods had no production. Fellow traders generally lacked whole-sale spot goods, so hand goods are in high demand and unrivaled.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Zhejiang Cocoons Open, Limited Arrivals</h3>
<p>Yesterday's silk market saw further declines in both Japan and the U.S. Yokohama spot prices were down slightly 40 yuan, and forward prices were down slightly 34 yuan. New York recent deliveries down 8.5 points, forward down one dime. Current exchange rates are also unfavorable for the export industry, so foreign sales are even more sluggish. British and American merchants have recently been uneasy about the industry and rarely inquire.</p>
<p>Regarding cocoon news, cocoons have opened in the Xiaxie area of Zhejiang province yesterday. However, due to poor harvests, cocoon arrivals are very limited. Old cocoons from eastern Zhejiang arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday, reaching about 2,000 dan. Although the number of silk factories operating in Shanghai is very limited, there seems to be no shortage of new and old cocoons.</p>
<h3>Wuxi Silkworm News Amidst the Announcement of New Cocoons</h3>
<p>In recent years, the silkworm silk industry has been thriving due to the sharp depreciation of foreign exchange rates and brisk sales in the United States, with unprecedented profits. This year's situation is no less than in previous years, so people in the industry are even more enthusiastic about management. The launch of new cocoons this year is imminent. Here are some brief notes on the silkworm affairs in Wuxi, the most famous cocoon-producing area in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, for reference.</p>
<p>(1) Silkworm Seed Selection</p>
<p>Silkworm seed selection is most important for breeding farmers. Last year, many breeding farmers purchased mixed brands, resulting in reduced harvests or premature death. Therefore, during the spring period this year, everyone is competing to purchase old-brand silkworm seeds. Among them, the Tiger brand from the Hushu Pass Dayou Seed Farm is the most welcomed by breeding farmers. This brand of seed farm opened at only 3.5 yuan per sheet, but through the manipulation of traffickers, it once rose to over 5 yuan. Mixed-brand seeds are also priced at around 2 yuan. Because of the farmers' distrust, many places lack inquiries, resulting in losses.</p>
<p>(2) Mulberry Leaf Price Increase</p>
<p>As cocoon and silk prices rise, farmers' interest in raising silkworms is more intense than in previous years. Because there was often a shortage in previous years, there are many people planting mulberry seedlings this year. The fertilization work of farmers is also more abundant than in previous years. However, because the amount of silkworms has increased sharply in recent years, the supply of leaves is ultimately insufficient. Therefore, supply and demand are diverging, and leaf prices are also exceeding normal levels. The upward trend is intensifying. The price has reached around 13 yuan in the northern region, and has even reached over 15 yuan per dan in the southern region. Currently, most silkworms are in their third molt, and their bodies are larger and their appetites have increased greatly. The price of mulberry leaves is still rising sharply in the recent days.</p>
<p>(3) Silkworm News from Various Villages</p>
<p>The southwest region, such as Fangju, Banqiao, Zhouxin Town, Fangquan, and Nanqiao, are the origin of silkworm farmers. The breeding aspects and the necessary equipment are superior to other places. Currently, most silkworms are in their third molt, and their bodies are developing well without any signs of disease. If the weather is humid and balanced, the results are expected to be good.</p>
<p>As for the northern region, such as Qianzhou, Beiqifang, Yanqiao, Chenshe, and Zhang Miaoshe, the news is that hatching is slightly later than other places, so most silkworms are in their second molt, and a few have reached their third molt. The situation is very good. It is generally believed that the current price of silk translated into cocoon prices is in the range of 250 yuan to 300 yuan.</p>
<p>(4) Cocoon Firm Registration</p>
<p>Currently, new cocoons are about to enter the market. The Wuxi Bureau convened fellow traders and held a meeting on the 8th to resolve various ongoing matters. It is heard that the registration of cocoon firms will be handled from May 12th to the 20th of this month. If those who open a cocoon business without registering by the deadline are investigated, they will be dealt with severely according to the law. In fact, the so-called registration procedures are actually the manipulative means of the "China Central Company". (Xiang)</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Coarse White Slightly Improves</h3>
<p>Yesterday the sugar market was flat, with coarse white sugar slightly improving. Refined white sugar only fluctuated by two to three dimes. The Association's settlement price for spot goods was: local goods of 24 coarse white sugar at 72 yuan to 72.5 yuan, up one yuan; new goods from foreign firms initially at 71.5 yuan to 7.7 yuan, later rising to 72 yuan to 72.12 yuan, and 72.67 yuan; transit goods at 58 yuan to 58.5 yuan, up half a yuan; Taiche White new goods B mark 85 yuan, up three dimes; Eastern firm's old goods traded at 83 yuan for 300 bags; XH mark new goods 83.2 yuan, H mark Red Suger 63 yuan, Dutch Red Suger 66 yuan. The factory's snow white sugar returned to 72.5 yuan. The crystal sugar price remained unchanged. Because domestic sugar production costs are high, and foreign sugar prices are weakening, listing prices are unwilling to weaken, holding firm with no continued sales. The foundation is very solid.</p>
<h3>Dried Goods: Red and Black Dates Continue to Rise</h3>
<p>Red and black dates have been tightening recently, continuing to increase. Tianjin red dates opened at more than eighty bags, king dates at 65 yuan, head dates at 55 yuan, first grade at 45 yuan. High-quality dried black dates were scarce, with over a hundred bags being offered, priced at 44 yuan. High-quality Fujian red dates at 28 yuan, ordinary at 26 yuan to 24 yuan.</p>
<h3>Metals Price Decline</h3>
<p>Recently, as foreign exchange rates have visibly increased, the selling prices of various goods have generally decreased. The same is true for the prices of metal products. However, sales channels in various regions remain inactive. Yesterday's market transactions were only two to three hundred piculs. Local can factories, printing factories, and toy factories; construction gangs' purchases of steel bars; and local factories' nails, new round bars, binding wire, and cement were all slightly increased. However, the quantities were very small, leading to a lack of market activity and a generally relaxed sentiment. For example, structural steel is selling for 230 yuan per case, new round bars are selling for 68 yuan per picul, nails are selling for 77-78 yuan, black steel billets are at 1,200 yuan, and tinplate is at 260 yuan, all slightly lower than before.</p>

<h3>Tiger Escapes Its Cage (Part 2)</h3>
<p>The strategist then said, "A dead cow may not be enough to lure the tiger. Why not sacrifice another live cow, and have a group lie in wait by the enclosure? We might then be able to control the tiger's fate." Everyone agreed. The arrangements were made. The day was fading into dusk. Four men, strong and brave, prepared a simple meal, prayed to the heavens, and with weapons at the ready, entered the park. They hid by the enclosure. Twenty quarter-hours passed. The moonlight shimmered on the water. Dry leaves rustled, and withered grass whispered. They looked at each other, their faces pale. Suddenly, the tiger roared again, an even more terrifying sound than the previous day! They listened fearfully. The tiger roamed the park, finding nothing to eat. It circled around to the cow enclosure, saw the live cow, and pounced upon it, fearing it would not die. The cow butted the tiger with its horns. The tiger roared in fury! It bit the cow's head, and the head fell to the ground. The men lying in wait fired their guns, hitting the tiger in the belly. The tiger roared and stumbled. The men fired again, hitting the tiger in the neck. The tiger roared loudly, leapt into the trees, and the forest shook, branches snapping and breaking. Everyone was terrified, and none dared to go and look. They held their breath all night, feeling as though the night was longer than any they had known before. Fortunately, they heard the first cock crow four times, and the light of dawn broke through. They cautiously emerged, spoke to their companions, and finally, clad in armor and with weapons in hand, went to where the tiger had been. The tiger was lying dead in a pool of blood, its claws and teeth bared, a sight that made the onlookers tremble. Nearby, a hundred-year-old tree had its branches and leaves broken and scattered, some of its roots pulled up. Everyone said that the mountain spirit's power had shaken the human world. If not for the cow, how could it have lost its body? Those who are greedy should take this as a warning. However, the fault of the king who raised the tiger cannot be excused either.</p>

<h3>The US Attitude After the German Invasion of Holland and Belgium</h3>
<p>— Xin Qiong</p>
<p>US Attention Remains Focused on the Pacific</p>
<p>Moral Efforts</p>
<p>The international diplomatic battle has been waged for quite some time, under the assumption that Holland would be invaded by Germany. Now that the fall of Holland has become a reality, the extent to which the menacing prophecies predicted in the diplomatic battle can be implemented naturally has a great bearing on future developments. Previously, the US very much wanted to use pressure to stop Germany from invading Holland, so a part of the population even speculated that this would provoke them to join the war. However, this form of situation arriving is obviously still early. Roosevelt's speech after the German invasion of Holland still only used the language that "foreign aggression has posed a tangible challenge to US civilization," so the US's temporary attitude will likely still be limited to using morality as a weapon.</p>
<p>Pressure on Italy</p>
<p>Naturally, the US's efforts to contain Germany's expansion have not been completely unsuccessful. Hitler clearly expected Italy to launch an offensive in the Mediterranean in response to his offensive in the North Sea. However, after repeated warnings from the US, Italy was forced to delay. It is difficult to say that Italy will remain calm, but Britain and France rely on this a great deal. The US pressure in this regard seems to have some power. This has no relation to whether the US will use force. Italy is one of the most economically deprived countries, and their willingness to be restrained by the US is due to economic reasons.</p>
<p>Attitude towards Britain and France</p>
<p>The US's temporary decision not to use force can also be seen in the measures taken for the territories of Denmark and Holland within the American sphere of influence. When Denmark fell, the US stated that it would protect Iceland, but in the end it was the British and French forces who landed in Iceland. When Holland fell, the US was about to consult with South American countries on how to handle Dutch possessions in the Americas. There are also rumors that British and French forces will land in the Dutch West Indies. It is difficult to say that this is what the US wants, but since the US has not yet made a definitive decision, it will temporarily rely on Britain and France to do as they see fit.</p>
<p>Attitude towards the Far East</p>
<p>The US has made a more decisive attitude towards its concern for the Dutch East Indies. The concentration of a large fleet in the Pacific and the proposal of a large-scale military expansion clearly show that the US prioritizes defense in the Pacific. The obvious goal is to use threats to prevent Japan from advancing south. It is difficult to say whether Britain and France fully understand this. Britain and France are temporarily not implementing protection of the Dutch East Indies. On the one hand, they are wary of Japan. On the other hand, they are waiting for the US to make a decision. For the time being, they are relying on the Dutch East Indies' own claim of strong defense capabilities, coupled with the eastern deployment of the Dutch Navy to strengthen the Dutch East Indies' naval defenses, as a buffer. However, these measures are under the command of Britain and France. The US will eventually need to come up with plans that are more beneficial to the US.</p>
<h3>Perilously Endangered: Europe's Only Neutral Country - Switzerland</h3>
<p>— Zhuo</p>
<p>After the German invasion of the neutral countries of Holland, Belgium, and Luxembourg, Switzerland, the world's only neutral country, remains in its original state. However, it is currently in a precarious situation, and in the near future, it may be drawn into the war and subjected to devastation. The current situation of this endangered small country is described below:</p>
<p>Governance</p>
<p>Switzerland is a federal republic composed of twenty-two cantons. The national governing power is mostly in the hands of the village or district communities, which then generate county councils to handle county affairs (a total of twenty-five counties nationwide). The Upper House members dispatched by the county administrative councils and the Lower House members elected by the people jointly elect the members of the Federal Administrative Council. Finally, the chairman is selected from within this administrative council as the President of the Swiss Republic. The highest federal government only manages foreign affairs, national railways, postal services, customs, currency, and a portion of military and educational affairs.</p>
<p>Cities</p>
<p>The capital is Bern, located on both banks of the Aare River, with extremely beautiful scenery and a prosperous urban condition. Handicrafts such as silk weaving and gemstone carving are famous. The city contains the Universal Postal Union and the Upper and Lower Houses. Other museums, art galleries, universities, and other buildings are all extremely grand and magnificent, with a population of 110,000. Other important cities include the transportation hub of Livorno, the trading center of Basel, the summer resort of Lausanne, the international political cooperation field of Geneva, the world-leading paradise king of Lucerne, and Locarno, where the famous Locarno Security Pact was signed.</p>
<p>Transportation</p>
<p>Mountains overlap and rivers are torrential. Modern transportation is also quite developed in Switzerland. The national railway is 3,500 miles long. Mountain railways and cable cars are set up between the valleys. The mountain railways are for tourists. Cable cars are scattered throughout the mountains, crisscrossing each other, looking like spider webs from afar. People in mountain villages often use these cable cars to transport hay, cheese, and white tower oil. In addition, there is a strange item on Swiss transportation, namely snow sleds, called "Toboggans" in English, which are used exclusively on snowy ground. In many places, mailmen deliver mail, students go to school, and women go to market, all riding on these sleds.</p>
<p>Industry and Commerce</p>
<p>More than 48 percent of the Swiss people are engaged in industry and commerce, so in Europe, Switzerland can also be called the most industrially developed country, except for Britain and Belgium. The most famous are metallurgy and weaving, followed by the world-famous watch industry. Many farmers often find handicrafts to do during their agricultural leisure time. Therefore, wood carving, ivory carving, grass weaving, lace making, hemp spinning, and weaving are also very developed in Switzerland.</p>
<h3>Gains and Losses of the German Invasion of Holland and Belgium</h3>
<p>— Fang Qi</p>
<p>The Old Battlefield of Waterloo Again Becomes a Place of Bloodshed</p>
<p>The rapid changes of the past week have almost made people forget that the German invasion of Holland, Belgium, and Luxembourg only occurred eight days ago. The exaggeration and fragmentary nature of war news have made even American news agencies, for whom news is the third-largest industry, only say that "due to the breadth of the war zone and the rapid German penetration into various locations, it is impossible to immediately accurately estimate the scope of the war zone and the actual numbers of troops on both sides." Even so, the combined area of the three countries - Holland, with over 12,000 square miles; Belgium, with over 11,000 square miles; and Luxembourg, with 1,000 square miles - is less than 25,500 square miles. The length from Groningen in the northernmost part of Holland to Dudelange in the southernmost part of Luxembourg is 300 miles. The distance from Aachen, on the border between Holland, Belgium, and Germany, northwest to The Hague is less than 150 miles, and southwest to Sedan is only a little over 100 miles. This war zone is not larger than the triangular area of Tanghe, Xinyang, and Zhongxiang on the border between Henan and Hubei provinces in China. The forces used by Germany in this area are probably only 300,000 to 500,000.</p>
<p>The center of gravity of the war is in the area west of Aachen. The first important city captured by Germany was Maastricht, directly west of Aachen, in the bastion area where the southern part of Holland protrudes between Germany and Belgium. After that, Germany developed with this as the center. The northeasternmost part of Holland was quickly occupied by Germany without fierce fighting. There was no retreat in this area, and therefore no method of defense. Luxembourg was also easily occupied by Germany. Although French news said that the Allies would advance to Luxembourg, it was just empty talk. The direction of the Moselle River shows that this is an unfavorable area for a counteroffensive. However, because Nancy is an important French military town, Germany did not continue south from Luxembourg. If Germany's advance in the center was not very smooth, then it would have been necessary to invade westward with heavy troops from Luxembourg. But since Germany broke through the Albert Canal and surrounded Liège, France and Belgium had no room to counterattack from this route. Therefore, Germany surrounded the Ardennes Mountains to the southwest along the Meuse River, and the troops in the Belgian province of Luxembourg had no choice but to retreat west of the Meuse River. Germany was then able to obtain the Ardennes Mountains with little effort, and then directly approached Sedan to attack France. The extension of the Maginot Line had been broken through, making the whole world focus on this historically famous battlefield. But as it stands now, Germany may not want to break through immediately. The most urgent problem to be solved is another famous historical battlefield: Waterloo, or rather, the area around Brussels (the Belgian capital). The Allied reinforcements are concentrated in that area, and Germany must either prevail or fail in that area. It is natural for the Allied side to prevent repeating the mistakes of the last European war, and it seems that Germany has not been able to adopt another strategy.</p>
<p>In the last European war, Germany considered France to be more important than Britain. This time, it considers Britain to be more important than France. The occupation of Holland was clearly for the sake of Britain, which is naturally different from the situation in the last European war. However, it is difficult to estimate how much damage having Holland as a base will cause to Britain. The use of air force to subdue a country is still largely a fantasy. Germany's claim that the invasion of Holland was to prevent Britain and France from passing through Holland is not just an excuse. This is what Germany really feared, but Britain seems to not intend to implement this plan, even if it had it. It provoked Germany to break the neutrality of other countries, so it had a good excuse to defend against Germany and to retain the right to inspect Chinese ships in order to increase the effectiveness of its blockade. Of the world's 68 million tons of ships, most belong to the nine major shipping countries. Now that Britain and France have re-manipulated the ships of Holland, Denmark, and Belgium, they have exceeded half of the tonnage. Adding the supporting United States and subtracting the Germany, whose ships cannot move freely, Britain and France have more than one-third of the tonnage that they are manipulating. If a blockade can truly lead to victory, then Germany will inevitably cut off its own path. Holland's fall, while Britain remains calm, may be because Britain believes that it has benefited. But once Britain understands that the effectiveness of a blockade is limited, then Britain will have suffered a heavy blow.</p>

<h3>Hitler</h3>
<h3>Grand Duchy of Luxembourg</h3>
<p>— Mitten</p>
<p>The very name "Grand Duchy" indicates that Luxembourg is a feudal remnant. During Napoleon's reign, it belonged to France, and later joined the German Confederation. However, it did not side with Prussia during the Austro-Prussian War, and thus, after the war (1867), it became an appendage of the Netherlands and subsequently an independent country. At that time, Germany not only did not foresee the later industrialization of the Rhineland but also did not anticipate the creation of the German Empire. Therefore, it did not pay much attention to this small land. After the Franco-Prussian War (1870), when Prussia acquired Alsace-Lorraine, Luxembourg was surrounded on three sides by Germany but still managed to maintain its independence, merely by luck. During the European War from 1914 to 1918, if the German side had not failed, Luxembourg's independence would have inevitably ended. This time, being occupied by Germany again, it seems that it cannot be restored unless Germany is defeated, so the Grand Duchess can only flee to France.</p>

<h3>Memorial Issue for Mr. Chen Xuyuan - Mourning Mr. Chen Xuyuan</h3>
<p>— Shen Yu</p>
<p>Before the establishment of the Home Industries Society in the country, Mr. Xuyuan was one of the few prominent men of letters in the Southeast. After the establishment of the Home Industries Society, Mr. Xuyuan became a nationally known industrialist. These are two distinct periods in the life history of Mr. Chen. The story of Mr. Chen's founding of the Home Industries Society and the hardships of its operation is well known to those who know a little about Mr. Chen's life. Zhou Zishou Juan and Xie Zitihong recorded it in great detail, so I need not add anything more. I only think that Mr. Chen started with a small industry and achieved such great success that he is now listed among the major industrialists in Shanghai. This was by no means accidental. The world only knows that Mr. Chen laid the foundation for his career with Invincible Brand Facial Cleansing Tooth Powder, but they do not know that Mr. Chen's intention in making tooth powder the first product at that time was profound and not merely for the sake of profit. Subsequently, the products launched after Invincible Brand Tooth Powder were almost all aimed at imported goods, which shows his painstaking efforts even more. With this painstaking effort and a spirit of perseverance, coupled with his keen acumen and strategy, he accumulated strength and eventually achieved greatness, making the national goods industry a strong bulwark. The people of the country were gradually influenced by Mr. Chen's transformation and also rose up to devote themselves to the production of national goods. As the saying goes, "The enlightened awaken those who are not yet enlightened," Mr. Chen is perhaps one of them. Since the decline of the world, people often criticize scholars as useless. Today, Mr. Chen is also a scholar, but his achievements are so outstanding that he can somewhat dispel the shame of scholars. I knew Mr. Chen more than twenty years ago, introduced by Mr. Liu Liren, an old friend of Mr. Chen. We often traveled and banqueted together. At that time, the Home Industries Society was just starting, and Mr. Chen often happily talked about his insights into chemistry, speaking tirelessly and with profound insights that often surpassed expectations. Later, as the business of the Home Industries Society expanded and many things fell on him, and I also became ill and lazy, we stopped associating with each other. Last year, Mr. Chen returned from Yunnan, and I repeatedly thought about visiting him but did not succeed. By the time Mr. Chen fell ill and passed away, I had not heard of it beforehand. On the day of the funeral, I heard the news too late and did not have time to attend the mourning, which can be said to have failed Mr. Chen greatly. Now, I include a poem in the style of seven-character ancient verse to mourn Mr. Chen. Although it is not enough to fully express Mr. Chen's life, it is at least a way to show the traces of our past interactions.</p>
<p>Mr. Chen's poetry and prose flowed like Xiang Ru, his talent and fame shook the nine continents in his early years. Like Yuan Mei from his hometown, his quick talent produced writings like a whistling wind. He would try writing thousands of words every day, entrusting them to the pencil and paper, and at that time, countless letters were sent racing through the stars. A true man praises books for their usefulness, holding onto dead phrases is not my kind. Only you, sir, were well-versed and thorough in both ancient and modern times, and in your later years, you pursued in-depth research into the physical world. With deep resentment towards our enemies, you were able to open up new paths in the use of things. Jade-like and snow-white, spreading to ten thousand mouths, the merits of sages of old who used stones to brush their teeth should be praised. As the world declines and households become isolated, the sound of weaving machines is no longer heard, and who in the neighborhoods and lanes is able to repair them? Mr. Chen, you devised plans to advise against the trend of laziness, creating a model workshop to leave behind good strategies. Shi Yi and Tao Zhu were not the only ones who excelled, a wise man opens up all things for the benefit of the multitudes. The world has long suffered from the uselessness of scholars, reciting benevolence and righteousness cannot satisfy hunger. Although Han Gao is dead, the criticism has not ceased, you rose up to wash away the shame of the scholars. Alas, how can scholars be useless? All things in ancient and modern times follow Ke Qiu, from writing to graduation, everything is consistent, and your achievements are indeed due to this. Long ago, I became acquainted with you through Mr. Liu (Liren), our relationship transcended age and was exceptionally kind. Tall and majestic like a pine tree standing tall, clear words were often exchanged as we raised our clear cups in toast. Since our separation, the years have been filled with wandering, and for twenty years, I have dreamed of the Yuan Long Tower. Since experiencing turmoil and scattering, you also traveled far to Sichuan and Yunnan, last year you returned from the south of the sky, the mountains and rivers were collected in your satchel. The vicissitudes of life lingered in my mind, and as I looked up, the river clouds floated dimly. Alas, I am clumsy and lazy, and neglected to inquire, sitting in shame as a former seagull on the riverbank. Mr. Chen did not wait for the Yellow River to become clear, and upon suddenly hearing the news, tears welled up in my eyes. Moreover, I still owe you a farewell at the coffin, and I am truly to blame for this. I believe that your spirit is immortal, and it is not only your poetry that remains in this world. The two Nan brothers rose up one after another, both exceptionally talented, and Yuan Fang's discussions on art were especially comprehensive. Your lofty morality illuminates the customs of the time, and your heroic spirit will remain for a thousand autumns. I heard that you have a living tomb by the West Lake, where plum blossoms are reflected by the pines and autumn leaves. Now the flames of war prevent your bones from returning, and the green mountains hold resentment, when will they be cleansed?</p>
<h3>Autobiography of Tianxu Wosheng</h3>
<p>I am the third son of the Yuehu Gong family, a tribute student attached to Qiantang County. I was recommended twice but failed the examinations, and after the abolition of the imperial examination system, I ended my life as a laborer. I have always been skilled in poetry, prose, lyrics, and songs, but I do not boast about it. Throughout my life, I have regarded rectifying my heart and making my intentions sincere, being always loyal and trustworthy, as my heavenly duty. In all things and matters, I want to exhaust their principles to the fullest extent of my knowledge. Therefore, I am skilled in many arts, but they are not useful to the world, so I call myself Tianxu Wosheng (Heavenly Void I Am Born). My medical writings are named Xu, my literary name is Diexian, and my surname is Chen. It is said that I am a descendant of Emperor Shun, so I can discard fame and fortune and make the whole family live with tolerance. Is this also a hereditary trait? I married a woman from the Zhu family and have two sons. The elder is named Qu, literary name Xiaodie, and the younger is named Cidié. My daughter's literary name is Jun. People who praise her often compare her to the Su family of Meishan.</p>
<h3>Chronology of Entrepreneurship</h3>
<p>The wise son of Mr. Xu, the tenth gentleman, recently wrote a chronology of his late father, which describes his life in great detail. Now, for the sake of this publication, we will extract the process of his dedication to hard work and record it below, calling it the Chronology of Entrepreneurship.</p>
<p>Year 2 of the Republic of China (Gui Chou), Mr. Chen was thirty-five years old. He traveled as a staff member in Yue, and in the autumn, he went to Zhenhai, where he assisted Mr. Qian Shou Xuan as a staff member, and served for a year as the acting magistrate. Once, while walking along the seashore, he saw vast amounts of cuttlefish bones. At that time, Diamond Tooth Powder was selling well, and the annual income of the customs exceeded one million yuan. Mr. Chen said: "This can be taken and replaced." So he presented a request to the government, asking to retain the surplus salt to establish a vocational training center for criminals, using cuttlefish bone powder as tooth powder, calling it Invincible Brand. People laughed at him, saying: "Why spend tens of thousands of yuan annually on such a trivial matter?" The Standing Bureau heard about this and obstructed it, so he resigned. He went to Shanghai to assist Mr. Shi Liangcai in editing the Shen Bao.</p>
<p>Year 7 (Wu Wu), Mr. Chen was forty years old. He compiled the "Home Knowledge" and published 100,000 copies, which sold out in half a month. The world began to recognize that Mr. Chen was proficient in physics and chemistry and not just known for his writing. In this year, he founded the Home Industries Society, aiming to replace machines with handicrafts so that everyone in the common people's lives could have food to eat. He invented Invincible Brand Facial Cleansing Tooth Powder. Mrs. Lan Yun was in charge of inspection, Xiaodie sieved the powder, and the children of the family were all workers. Within half a year, it spread throughout the north and south of the Yangtze River, and his poetry and writing became scarce.</p>
<p>Year 8 (Yi Wei), Mr. Chen was forty-one years old. He founded the Home Box-Making Factory.</p>
<p>Year 9 (Geng Shen), Mr. Chen was forty-two years old. He founded the First Magnesium Factory in Wuxi.</p>
<p>Year 10 (Xin You), Mr. Chen was forty-three years old. He used inexpensive methods to achieve great results, and Mr. Chen's energy began to be spent here. In this year, he built the Half Mu Garden on the lake, and there is a collection of poems called "Half Mu Garden Collection."</p>
<p>Year 18 (Ji Si), Mr. Chen was fifty-one years old. He and Mr. Xiang Songmao, Shen Jiucheng, and others founded the Joint Factory of Machine-Made National Goods in Shanghai, and there was a meeting of the Machine Joint Association. The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce hired him as a member of the Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<p>Year 19 (Geng Wu), Mr. Chen was fifty-two years old. He founded the Huiquan Soda Factory.</p>
<p>Year 13 (Jia Zi), Mr. Chen was forty-six years old. He founded the Invincible Glass Factory.</p>
<p>Year 15 (Bing Yin), Mr. Chen was forty-eight years old. He founded the Liyong Paper Mill.</p>
<p>Year 16 (Ding Mao), the National Government established its capital in Nanjing, and Mr. Chen was forty-nine years old. He founded the Invincible Brand Mosquito Coil Factory in Zhenjiang.</p>
<p>Year 17 (Wu Chen), Mr. Chen was fifty years old. He welcomed Mr. Li Xinpu to join as an unlimited liability shareholder of the Home Industries Society and devoted himself exclusively to the paper-making business until his death, for twelve years without interruption. His goal was to use manual labor to utilize rice straw and bamboo in various villages and towns, adapting to local conditions to create pulp and replace foreign paper, assisting the development of culture. The machines used were all designed with ingenuity. From Ding Mao to Geng Wu, he mostly lived in Ronghu Village in Liangxi, and he and his fourth uncle Rongxuan successfully operated the paper-making business. Small crafts and small series of books were published.</p>
<p>Year 25 (Bing Zi), Mr. Chen was fifty-eight years old. While living in Hangzhou, his old friend Mr. Xu Qingfu was the head of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, and the Director of Construction, Wang Chunbo, and the Mayor, Zhou Qiyu, were all close friends with Qu. They invited Mr. Chen to serve as a design committee member, improving manual paper-making throughout Zhejiang Province. He and his second son, Zu, surveyed the land at Fancun at the foot of Mount Wuyun and established the Provincial Model Paper Mill, which was successful the following year. The Jiangxi Provincial Government also hired Mr. Chen to design and establish a model manual paper mill in Nanchang, and there were lectures on model paper-making.</p>
<p>Year 26 (Ding Chou), Mr. Chen was fifty-nine years old. He collected his poems, prose, and miscellaneous writings since Jia Xu and published the "59th Anniversary Collection." He was hired by the Central Government as a design committee member of the Ministry of Industry. In the spring, he went to Nanjing as a member of the handicraft review committee, and in the summer, he went to the lake. In the autumn of that year, the August 13th Incident occurred, and his eldest son, Qu, accompanied Mr. Chen from Hangzhou to Hankou. He then went upstream along the Yangtze River to Junqing and ordered his disciple Li Shaoguang to establish a model paper mill in Hejiang, and his nephew Zu'en to improve manual paper-making in Jiading. Wherever Mr. Chen passed, the gray and yellow paper was all turned white. In the winter, he went to Chengdu, staying at the Fengwu Thatched Cottage of the Jiang family.</p>
<h3>Crying for Uncle Chen Xuyuan</h3>
<p>— Zhou Shoujuan</p>
<p>Leading the literary world for forty autumns, the lyrics and prose of Jiangguan are naturally clear and graceful. Since you left, sir, the sound of chanting has become silent, and the setting sun is melancholy in the Golden Valley Village. (Uncle's Shanghai residence was in Golden Valley Village on Jin Shenfu Road.)</p>
<p>The setting sun is melancholy in the Golden Valley Village. You let go of everything and rested in peace, and your poetic soul has transformed into a Zhuang Zhou butterfly, freely roaming the two prefectures of Bai.</p>
<p>A family of elegance and happiness, composing poems and competing in rhymes with leisurely intentions, but now where is the person who strikes the bowl, the setting sun is melancholy in the Golden Valley Village.</p>
<p>The setting sun is melancholy in the Golden Valley Village, but you have already relieved yourself of all worries. Your coffin is closed, and there is no shame or regret, and your strong integrity and yellow chrysanthemums adorn the late autumn.</p>
<p>Poetry boxes and zither bags leave behind your handwriting, and the death of a person and the existence of things breed deep sorrow. The literary fish sobs, and the literary birds weep, the setting sun is melancholy in the Golden Valley Village. (Uncle also loved fish and birds, placing birdcages next to his seat, feeding them himself, and also placing a crystal tank, raising many small goldfish, enjoying their sight.)</p>
<p>The setting sun is melancholy in the Golden Valley Village, what more can you ask for after achieving success and fame? Your skill in public transportation is truly invincible, leaving behind the fragrance of teeth in ten continents.</p>
<p>Traveling thousands of miles in exile with a healthy waist and feet, you took Qingyou as your leisure in Sichuan and Yunnan. Where is Yuan Long's heroic spirit now, the setting sun is melancholy in the Golden Valley Village.</p>
<p>The setting sun is melancholy in the Golden Valley Village, and the spring is lonely like deep autumn, only because heaven took away Chen Jingzuo, and there is no more heroic talk that pierces the Bullfight.</p>
<p>Diligently and diligently until your white head, copying scriptures and writing poems from morning till night without rest, and now the pen and inkstone are all idle, the setting sun is melancholy in the Golden Valley Village.</p>
<p>The setting sun is melancholy in the Golden Valley Village, and the tears of the spoiled girl of the Zuo family are difficult to collect, the fallen flowers and drizzle make people live long, can there be new lyrics to send to the Cuilou. (When Uncle discussed lyrics with me, he said that in the collection of Yan Jidao, only the two lines "Fallen flowers and people standing alone, light rain and swallows flying in pairs" are the best. The day Uncle died was also when there was light rain and swallows flying in pairs. Usually, Uncle would always show his works to his daughter, Ms. Cuina, who is also skilled in rhyme, and has works such as "Cuilou Yin Cao.")</p>
<p>Only when you die do you know that happiness comes from Sichuan, and life is originally like a floating bubble, but sadly, the family and country have many regrets, the setting sun is melancholy in the Golden Valley Village.</p>
<p>The setting sun is melancholy in the Golden Valley Village, how can one bear to trace the dust dream from the beginning, last night I endured listening to the flute of Shanyang, and my heart broke over the old tavern by the West Lake. (I used to travel with Uncle to the West Lake and often drank in Louwailou.)</p>
<p>Everything is like yesterday's death, and the wise words are clearly remembered in my heart, and now who can comfort me in my suffering, the setting sun is melancholy in the Golden Valley Village. (Whenever I encountered unsatisfactory things, I would tell Uncle about them, and Uncle would always comfort me with the phrase "Like yesterday's death.")</p>
<p>The setting sun is melancholy in the Golden Valley Village, when will your bones return to your old homeland Qiu, the poet should accompany Bu Xian to leave, and sing and play in the autumn grave under the moonlight. (Uncle has a living tomb built on Taoyuan Ridge on the lake, called Diechao, but the flames of war have not yet subsided, and I don't know when it will be possible to be buried there.)</p>
<p>Year 27 (Wu Yin), Mr. Chen was sixty years old, from Sichuan and Yunnan, living in Jiang Xiaojian's Lingjian New Pavilion, accompanied by his eldest son Qu. Yunnan salt contains a lot of Glauber's salt, and those who eat it have heavy throats, so Mr. Chen set up an improved salt refinery in Anning Prefecture, and also wanted to use trifoliate orange and sugar cane to make paper, but it failed before it was completed, and Mr. Chen sighed. In the autumn, he went to Hong Kong, and in the winter, he returned to Shanghai, publishing the "Ershun Collection." Wherever he passed through Hanyu and Yunnan, he established branch factories of the Home Industries Society, ordering his eldest son Qu to manage them. By the time he returned to Shanghai, the transportation between Chongqing and Yunnan was greatly obstructed, and the Invincible Brand Southwest goods relied on the branch factories to be self-sufficient.</p>
<p>Year 28 (Ji Mao), Mr. Chen was sixty-one years old, lamenting that his hometown could not be returned to, so he lived in Shanghai, often saying: "Business is a public instrument of society. I entrust the Home Industries Society to Xinpu, which is also the meaning of our former sages Yu Shan Yu, and I can have no regrets." Only the improved paper-making industry, which is the essence of my life's work, has no one to inherit my will. His eldest son Lian and Xing gathered funds with his friend Ding Huikang Xu Bangda to set up a factory, and all the plans were drawn up by Mr. Chen, based on his original intention, to popularize small-capital factories in the interior, so that everyone can easily obtain food and clothing. Therefore, it was named Dasheng Company; Mr. Chen was also seriously ill.</p>

<h3>Where are You Going? (1)</h3>
<p>"For the gate is narrow and the way is hard that leads to life, and those who find it are few." Every year, countless students graduate from universities and middle schools during the summer vacation. When they receive their diplomas from the principal and return to their seats, their friends will ask them a question that concerns their future, which is, "Where are you going?" Since their numbers are so large, the paths they take are naturally different. Some are advancing on the road to success, some are traveling on the road to failure, some are walking the road to life, and some are going to the road to death. Someone said, "There is a way that seems not bad, but in the end, it is a dead end." He also said, "The path of the righteous is like the light of dawn, gradually becoming brighter and brighter, until it is completely bright." The path of sinners is gradually difficult, while the path of good people is developing day by day. Jesus once proclaimed to the world with his wise eyes that there are two paths in the world: one is wide and easy to walk, leading to destruction, and many people walk it; the other is narrow and difficult to walk, leading to eternal life, but few people find it. Education may enable us to be suitable for a certain kind of work, but when we go to find work with our diplomas, we may not be able to find any. This is because finding suitable work has a lot to do with whether there is an opportunity. However, young people want to be determined to be people, and this authority is in their own hands, and they don't need to rely on opportunity. Therefore, we should not only look at this chaotic world where the door of opportunity is closed, we should look inward and upward, and bravely be the kind of person we want to be. If we have such determination, our inner world will sooner or later affect this outer world. Because a person's success or failure depends more on his inner spiritual power than on the work he is engaged in. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>What Should We Do in the Midst of Soaring Prices?</h3>
<p>— Wen</p>
<p>Children, in this time of soaring prices of rice, pearls, firewood, and cinnamon, when parents are worried about firewood and rice all day long, should we still be ignorant children, reaching out our hands for money, randomly buying snacks to eat, or wanting to buy pencils and notebooks at any moment, increasing the burden on our parents? No, we must be children who know the times. Although we cannot share our parents' economic burden, we should try our best to save and reduce our parents' burden. The following are a few things that we should do at this time, and they are the most common and achievable.</p>
<p>1. Strive for Learning: Children! Let us calculate how much the tuition fee is for each semester. I think the cost of schooling for an average elementary school student is probably around fifty or sixty yuan per year. For families with many sisters and brothers, the cost of education is very considerable. Parents cultivate us through extreme hardship and by saving every penny. If we are not willing to work hard and discipline ourselves, and when the end of school comes, our grades are not up to par and we cannot advance to the next grade, or we have to drop out of school because of this, it will be too late to regret it.</p>
<p>2. Take Care of Clothing and Supplies: Children's clothing and supplies are the most expensive. A piece of clothing gets torn in a few days, a new pair of shoes gets torn in less than a week, and a new book gets torn into pieces in less than a month. Other wastes, such as pencils, erasers, and notebooks, cannot be listed one by one. In short, all the supplies for children are more expensive than those for adults. What is the reason? First, children do not know the difficulty of where they come from. Second, they do not know how to use them properly. For example, a new brush pen should be washed clean with water before and after use. When it is glued by ink, it is put in the mouth and bitten, and the brush hairs are bitten off and fall out, so it cannot be written again. Now the price of a brush pen and a pencil has also increased several times. If you are not willing to use them carefully and carefully, using a pencil as several, and wearing a piece of clothing as two, you may not be able to afford to buy them in the future.</p>
<p>3. Forge and Protect Your Body: The surge in medical expenses is not something that ordinary families can afford. Therefore, we must forge and protect our bodies. (1) Regarding forging: Because of environmental reasons, there is no large venue for us to exercise. We can take advantage of the time when there are few people in the early morning and the air is fresh to hold morning exercises in the patio or on the balcony. And develop the habit of walking, because walking can help digestion and promote blood circulation, it is a good full-body exercise. (2) Regarding protection: Eat on time, choose nutritious foods, such as green vegetables and tofu, and do not eat leadership affairs. In summer, get various vaccinations to prevent the spread of diseases. 3. Make full use of waste: We often see children picking up garbage on the road, finding broken cloths and broken glass in the trash cans. These dirty and broken things are taken to be sorted and transformed into practical and beautiful supplies to sell to us. Therefore, if we need any utensils or toys, we should try our best to collect useless waste in our homes, create or copy them, and do our best. Sometimes we can get what we hope for without spending a penny.</p>
<h3>A Chemical Story</h3>
<p>— Zhu Kaiqing</p>
<p>Children: Now I will report to you an interesting thing, which was told to me in a letter from my friend in Shaanxi.</p>
<p>My friend lives in Xi'an, Shaanxi. He wrote in a letter: "... Once, I went to visit the famous historical site of the Tang Dynasty—Huaqing Pool—with my sisters. There are hot springs gushing out there (locals sometimes take them to bathe because the hot springs contain sulfur, which can treat skin diseases; such as: scabies, psoriasis, etc., this is the so-called mineral bath). When we walked there and were enjoying the scenery, suddenly I looked up and saw that the white powder on my sisters' faces had turned into a layer of black ash. I felt very strange at the time..." I got this news myself, and I was also very curious and couldn't think of a reason for a while. I ran to ask the chemistry teacher, and he replied: "Because ordinary inferior powder contains alkaline lead carbonate (commonly known as lead white), and the hot springs contain sulfur. When the weather is clear, it is evaporated by the sun's rays and becomes hydrogen sulfide gas, which spreads into the air. When hydrogen sulfide encounters lead white, it undergoes a chemical change and turns black. They must have applied inferior powder, so this happened. And because inferior powder contains lead, it is toxic and should not be used." I suddenly understood this question. Children, you must love beauty and like to apply powder! However, according to my teacher, ordinary inferior powder contains lead and is toxic and should not be used; then buying more expensive powder is too expensive; especially at a time when prices are soaring. So I advise you, you might as well save and save the money used to apply powder.</p>
<h3>Don't Ever Use the Road as a Playground!</h3>
<p>— Xin Liang</p>
<p>Children, after you finish reading in school, do you go home immediately? Or, do you like to gather three or four classmates to play on the side of the road or at the end of the alley? I think, in reality, there must be many, many young classmates who specialize in happily playing "rolling water chestnuts" and "building houses" on the road.</p>
<p>Here, let me report a fact to you all. Wang Er, who lives next door to my house, was playing "rolling water chestnuts" on the road with two classmates. A car drove from a distance, and he didn't notice it at all. By the time his attention shifted from the water chestnuts to the "doo...doo..." car horn, he originally wanted to avoid it immediately, but it was too late. Suddenly, the heavily loaded car rushed straight at him. He could only fall to the ground, letting the car roll over his arm. This poor Wang Er is still being treated in the hospital. His parents have already spent hundreds of dollars on him, and he himself has lost a precious arm. Moreover, he has also wasted a lot of schoolwork! In addition, he has to suffer in the hospital.</p>
<p>"The road is like the mouth of a tiger!" This sentence is not wrong at all! The road is very dangerous, and none of us children should use it as a playground. Even if you want to do some recreation in your spare time, you should jump and play in the campus or in the table tennis room, playing table tennis. You can't play on the road under any circumstances!</p>
<h3>Shirley Temple's Autobiography (3)</h3>
<p>— Min</p>
<p>But even when I had free time, I didn't want to go play on that frequently visited beach. There were just too many people surrounding me, making it unbearable. I remember one summer when we went to Balboa—a beach not far from Los Angeles. Dad's bank happened to have a holiday, so we stayed there for two weeks. I played on the sand with the other children, and we had a lot of fun. I told them my name was Shirley, and they each told me their names too. One morning, a lady stood in front of me and exclaimed, "Oh my! You look just like Shirley Temple!"</p>
<p>I thought it was funny, so I smiled at the lady and said, "Yes, that's me—Shirley Temple." The lady was dubious and stunned for a minute or two, then she came over and looked at me carefully from head to toe. Then she saw my mom and dad standing nearby and became so excited she couldn't speak. Finally, she took a small booklet out of her purse and asked if they would allow me to sign it for her. Mom agreed and called me over. I was happily digging a sand tunnel with the children when I heard Mom's call. I immediately stopped and hurried over to sign my name in the lady's booklet. At that time, I couldn't write very well yet, so signing my name was difficult. It took me a while just to sign "Love—Shirley Temple." After the lady saw me finish writing, she was very grateful and thanked me again and again, saying that she had a niece in the East who was about my age and would be so happy to know that she had spoken to the real Shirley Temple.</p>
<p>After she left, I went back to digging the tunnel. Before long, many people came over. Some just walked by and glanced at me, while others shouted, "Hello, Shirley!" I replied with a "Hello," but I really wanted to say to them, "Please don't bother me, can't you see I'm busy digging a tunnel?" But they had already taken out pencils and booklets, bending down to beg me to sign their names. Just as I was at a loss, Mom came over and softly told them that I couldn't sign any more autographs today because it was time for my afternoon nap and we had to go back. So we went back to the hotel together. Actually, it wasn't time for my afternoon nap yet, but Mom was using that as an excuse to get me away. Dad held me on his lap and said, "Sweetheart, this is because you are already famous." Then he read a story from a book to me. I kept looking out the window, thinking how fun it would be to play on the beach a little longer and finish digging the tunnel.</p>
<p>When I was very young, we lived in Santa Monica. Mom and Dad often took my little table and chair to the beach. Can you guess why? Let me tell you, it was because I always had lunch in the sunlight, sitting at my own little table. Mom brought a big thermos filled with soup, porridge, or vegetables for me to eat, all hot. She said she always wanted me to eat at a certain time, so I wouldn't miss a meal even when we were away from home. Did you know that when I first started making movies (when I was only three and a half years old), Mom always brought this thermos to the set? Other women sometimes laughed at my mom for being too careful about my food, but she didn't care. She always carried the thermos with her and said, "Regardless of whether we are at a movie set or not, my darling must eat well."</p>

<h3>My Humble Opinion for the Yifeng Society</h3>
<p>— Only Me</p>
<p>The Yifeng Society of Carlton recently had six members leave: Liang Ciyou, Li Wenjun, Ma Jinfeng, Wang Zhongping, Wang Zhongying, and Cao Mukun. The departure of these six has greatly affected the Yifeng Society's performances. Qilin Tong sings male roles with beards, and the most important thing for these roles is the small painted face (just like the most important thing for female roles is the young male actor). Especially for Carlton, who specializes in new plays, the clown role is even more important. Among the six who left the Yifeng Society this time, three are small painted-face actors.</p>
<p>In the past, Qilin Tong had two inseparable small painted-face actors: one was Zhou Wubao and the other was Liu Binkun. Both of these men were top-notch clown talents in the Jiangnan area. Qilin Tong's past achievements were greatly due to these two small painted-face actors. Since the Yifeng Society performed at Carlton, Zhou Wubao left due to illness. The small painted-face lineup was Liu Binkun, Li Hansan, Liang Cishan, Wang Zhongying, and Cao Mukun. Among them, Li Hansan's salary was higher than Liang, Wang, and Cao. But his skills were worthless. Liang Cishan and Wang Zhongying are two rising stars who are not bad. So losing Zhou Wubao did not cause too much of a problem for Qilin Tong's performances. Later, unfortunately, Liu Binkun also left, giving the Yifeng Society a major blow. At the same time, the Yifeng Society also knew that Li Hansan could not hold up the overall situation, so they invited Zhu Baisui to join as a temporary replacement. However, Zhu Baisui was then invited to perform in other places and left. This created Liang Cishan's position. Although Li Hansan's salary was higher than Liang Cishan's, the audience welcomed Cishan more than Hansan. As a result, the Yifeng Society relied heavily on Cishan. Now that Cishan has left, along with Wang Zhongying and Cao Mukun, the Yifeng Society is left with only Li Hansan out of the four basic clowns. One can imagine how this will affect the Yifeng Society.</p>
<p>Now, it is said that the Yifeng Society has invited replacements. One is called Cao Huilin, the son of the old actor Cao Fuchen, who originally studied clean roles and also works as a clown. His skills seem to be inferior to Liang Cishan's. Shen Zhixian has the same position and artistic style as Wang Zhongying, so the replacement is quite appropriate. Out of my deep love for Qilin Tong's art, I would like to offer some advice. Liang Cishan's vacancy has not yet been filled, and a suitable person should be invited as soon as possible. It would be best to borrow Jiao Baokui from the Great Stage, or borrow Qin Suogui from the Gong Stage. He is also an old partner of Qilin Tong and his skills are quite good. Moreover, the Gong Stage has many small painted-face actors, so it would be fine to borrow him from there. If the Yifeng Society does not want to borrow people from other troupes, then it would be better to invite Zhu Baisui to join again. He is familiar with the role and is better than nothing.</p>
<h3>Silver Train</h3>
<p>— Xinggu</p>
<p>Ma Xiewei Bang told reporters that the sequel to "Midnight Song" is 30% complete. After this film is finished, he may change his style and switch to ancient historical films. Because some people say that he can only direct horror films and cannot direct other films, this has aroused his ambition to direct ancient films and he is preparing to adopt more progressive historical themes.</p>
<p>Chen Yunshang returned to Shanghai and is resting at home every day due to travel fatigue. Li Minghui accompanies her to chat every afternoon, but in a week, "Su Wu Shepherding Sheep" may start filming. The male lead is still Mei Xi, playing Su Wu, and Chen plays the princess. After this film is completed, the next films scheduled are "The Creation of the World" and "Lady Huarui." After filming, Yunshang still wants to return to Hong Kong, because she has already agreed to a company's invitation. Before coming to Shanghai, she only filmed one film, "The Romantic Empress," in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Yang Xiaozhong is actively rushing to film "Sui Palace Spring Colors," which is not yet finished. He has already been attacked because the words "Spring Colors" are somewhat indecent. However, according to the screenwriter Chen Dabei, the plot of "Sui Palace Spring Colors" does not have any bad taste.</p>
<p>Last night, Sheng Pihua and Zhang Shankun hosted a banquet for Yu Qiaqing, Wen Lanting, Lin Kanghou, Zhang Weiru, and others, as well as Chen Yunshang, Chen Yanyan, Tong Yuejuan, Li Hong, Lu Luming, Li Minghui, etc. Lin Kanghou was invited to give a speech, and Chen Yunshang thanked everyone. The banquet ended happily after ten o'clock.</p>
<h3>After the Rain, a Clear Sky</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 24: The Lakes and Mountains are Swept Clean, Each with its Own Charm; The Scholars and Ladies Cheer Together, Calling "Long Live"</p>
<p>Their group came to the house of the triplets again. These three little brothers had also learned the etiquette of bowing and shaking hands. Zhu Airen then gave them a set of clay figurines that Mrs. Xue of Wuxi had given her. They each held one, with one saying: "It looks like you," and another saying: "It looks like him," but they didn't know that they all looked like themselves. Ms. Kang Ning, who was raising the three children, said: "If I give them to you to play with, they will all be broken in less than three days. Give them all to me, and I will put them in a glass case to display tomorrow." The three children obediently handed them over to Ms. Kang Ning. At that time, Shao Huihua was even more excited, hugging one and then another, and took several photos of them. Later, she also took a photo of Ms. Kang Ning, who was raising the three little treasures. She also asked Ms. Tong Haiying, the director of the kindergarten, to take a photo. Although Shao Huihua had followed Jin Dan'e's honeymoon trip to Anle Town, she was also collecting materials for the newspaper. When she went back, she was planning to write an article, and these photos were her illustrations. It was already 3:30 PM. They left Anle Town and were going to Freedom Village. When Zhu Airen was making a long-distance call to Old Jing Shengshi in Huzhou, she also casually mentioned that she was going to Baiyoutong and asked Old Zhang Physician to tell her grandfather. Therefore, Zhu Village Chief already knew. At this time, the two He sisters were a little anxious, thinking that they were only concerned with delaying, and by the time they got to Freedom Village, it would be night. How could they see the factory site then? But Zhu Airen was paying attention, and urged them. Moreover, although Zhu Airen had returned to the hospital, she still accompanied them to Freedom Village. Fortunately, it only took about ten minutes to get from Anle Town to Freedom Village. The family travel car passed along the way, seeing the neat roads and lush forests, they knew that this village was well-managed. Today, Zhu Village Chief was hosting them at the Freedom Village Elementary School, intending to let them see the intentions of this elementary school, and also wanted to keep them for dinner. Although he hadn't told them in advance, he knew that they would be returning to Shanghai from Freedom Village. When they returned to Shanghai, they would also be having dinner, so why not have a meal here? By the time they arrived at Freedom Village, Old Mr. Zhu had told his granddaughter Zhu Airen about keeping them for dinner. Zhu Airen thought: Anyway, they are not going anywhere else, so it doesn't matter. However, the taste of the countryside may not be enough to entertain the guests. But they came today to see the factory site of the two He sisters, and the sky was gradually darkening, so it was better to go and see the factory site first. (281)</p>
<h3>Important Resolutions of the Second National Film Association</h3>
