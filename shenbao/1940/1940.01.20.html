<h3>中國法幣基礎之檢討</h3>
<p>去年一年，上海黑匯市塲，英匯曾自八辦士以上一度落至三辦士有奇，美匯自十五元以上最低至六元左右，洶湧澎湃，一如狂瀾之倒，人心惶惶，莫知所措。於是懷疑於法幣信用者，竟不擇手段，不暇推究，惟以資金之逃避是務；而利用時機，從中破壞，冀收漁翁之利者復大有人在。加以「統制」勒索之方法愈密，投機囤積之兇燄愈張，馴致物價飛漲，民生艱困，社會杌隉，說者又以此歸咎於幣值之下落，必爲通貨膨脹，無法調劑，物價狂漲，無術平準，農村凋敝，無可救濟之情形相類似。孰意證諸事實，非但大謬不然，抑且中日經濟情況，竟不可以相提並論，此非故作誇詞也。蓋去年上海金融之大變，發動於處心積慮破壞中國整個金融之機構，使陷於萬刦不復之地位，而遂其獨霸一時之企圖。若當時上海對外匯率不起而採取適當應付之手段，則外匯基金，勢必爲所鯨吞蠶食而無餘，故爲自衛上之必要，不維持上海外匯，一任其升降浮沉自生自滅，適以保全中國金融之元氣，誠所謂忍一時之痛，策百年之計者也，若使法幣果已至不可收拾之地步，其對外匯率，必將如江河之日下，無回頭之可能，而一觀去冬外匯趨勢，非但有時回長，亦且平穩異常，此即法幣本身健全之明證。</p>
<p>即以紙幣發行額而言，日本人口九千八百萬，而去年末紙幣發行額竟達三十八億元；中國人口四萬六千萬，而去年末法幣流通額衹有三十億元。以人口與人口相比，日本人口僅有中國人口百分之二一，以紙幣發行額相比，日本紙幣比中國紙幣多發行百分之二六。再以準備而言，日鈔三十八億元，據外報所傳，僅有金準備五億元，衹占百分之一三·一六；中國法幣三十億元，而現金準備乃有十五億四千六百萬元，竟得百分之五〇·一七，以此例彼，中國法幣之基礎，堅固如鐵的一般，而日本紙幣之準備，則誠大覺脆弱矣。此亦非爲中國法幣故作宣傳也，試觀中國紙幣發行額之趨勢，益可明前說之非謬。中國法幣發行額，在蘆溝橋事變之前一月（即民國二十六年六月）爲十四億元，至翌年同期（二十七年六月），即戰事發生後之一年，爲十七億六千萬元，去年（二十八年）六月底爲二十六億二千萬元，此一年中增加八億六千萬元，數似頗鉅，及至去年末又增加四億六千萬元，而有三十億八千萬元發行總額。然若衡其實際，所增加者不得謂爲鉅也，蓋西南各省之貨幣，向極凌亂，硬幣與地方紙幣，紛然雜陣，自國府西遷以後，始逐漸整理，期於統一（即法幣），因之法幣之需要驟增，自爲理所當然。此其例證亦甚明顯，向來中國紙幣之發行額，以中國銀行爲最多，故以中央銀行之地位，尚有所不逮，交通農民兩行更居其後，至前年六月中國銀行法幣發行額爲六億五千萬元，中央銀行尚止四億九千萬元，趨勢猶未改變，直至去年六月在此一年中情勢始見大變，中央銀行發行紙幣爲十億元，中國銀行爲七億元，去年末中央銀行爲十三億四千萬元，中國銀行仍止七億七千萬元，超過中國銀行者乃有五億七千萬元之鉅。此殆由於中國銀行以歷史關係，向爲東南金融界之巨擘，迨抗戰軍興，政府人民，逐漸內移，爲應情勢之需要，中央銀行以地位關係業務，乃自然擴大，而發鈔亦自然增加矣。何況整理內地通貨，勢必收回大宗雜幣，起而補其缺者，又非法幣而何，更以限制提存及受戰事影響，儲藏現鈔者尤夥，爲謀適應地方之需要而增發一部分之新法幣，亦爲市民所殷求，此紙幣發行所以增加之由來也。夫以中國區域之廣，人口之眾，物產之富，貨幣之雜，如盡能推行法幣，三十億之發行額，自未達飽和點也。而況此三十億之法幣，尚有五成有奇之現金準備乎？懷疑於法幣信用者，自可恍然大悟矣。</p>
<p>然此信用之由來，非可以徼幸致也。中國對外貿易常居於入超地位，而去年雖以洋貨消耗最大之口岸若上海者，亦爲出超，寗非大幸，即最近外匯之得以平衡，焉知非與進口貿易減少有關。日本則不然，雖亦名爲出超，然除去日元集團之貿易外，其應付外匯之貿易，仍爲入超，故彼國內經濟恐慌，比之身受戰爭摧殘破壞之中國爲尤甚。而況爲中國土貨集散地之香港，去年十一個月經香港而出口之中國貨物，共值港幣二億七千四百萬元之鉅，單就桐油一項，去年美國所購者已值美金一千五百萬元，由是可知中國法幣之鞏固，蓋非無因。況自物價飛漲，都市生活，咸感困難之際，而農產物價亦同時升騰，農民因以收入驟增，逈異平時，「資金流向農村去」不斯於今日見之，世事固有不可以常理論者矣。雖來日方長，戰事未平，目前一時之佳況，未可視爲定論，然就已往之成績，而測未來之情勢，固可抱樂觀而無疑者也。</p>
<h3>美參議員提出　禁軍火原料輸日案　認爲制止侵略有效行動　民眾反對美日續訂商約</h3>
<p>華盛頓　美國共和黨參議員卡柏、昨日在參議院提出對日實施禁止軍火原料輸日案、渠稱、渠並不鼓吹向日作戰、但「余鄭重聲明、吾人必須停止以吾國軍火接濟日本、作爲侵略中國之用」、卡柏將某一選民抗議重訂日美商約之函件、亦要求登入國會紀錄內、渠稱、渠接獲同樣性質函件、計數百封之多、卡柏引證美國接濟日本軍火統計、一九三七年美國接濟日本之軍火，計百分之五十四、一九三八年則爲百分之五十六、一九三九年則增至百分之八十、倘美國完全停止接濟、則日本侵略中國即須停止、卡柏又曰、「余對吾國數萬人民憎惡日本侵略中國之舉、表示同情、故余主張必須停止出售軍火於日本及其他侵略國」、卡柏又稱、渠之態度與先前投票反對中立法案時之態度完全一致、（十九日合眾電）</p>
<p>華盛頓　據此間商人及官方消息、當美日商約廢止後、數百留美之日本商人、仍可繼續駐在美國、至於新到美國之日商人則須照遊歷家辦理、凡新到美國之日本商人衹可在美國居留兩年、期滿後必須重行請求、否則將被驅出境、美國務院對於此事、不作任何批評、（十九日合眾電）</p>
<h3>日本外交　僵局不易打破　親蘇聯歟抑親美歟　承認有心理上困難</h3>
<p>東京　日本「報知新聞」今日批評日本外相有田八郎之意旨時聲稱、美國與蘇聯各懷戒懼心、故兩國均對日本施行壓力、以致日本對兩國關係處於逆境、該報宣稱、『美國駐日大使格魯曾告前任日本外相野村吉三郎大將、謂美國「對於日本與蘇聯接近極爲關切」、該種關切形成日美商務談判不能滿意進行』該報續稱、『相反的、蘇聯亦設法阻止日美關係之調整、該項企圖影響「外蒙」與「滿洲國」劃界談判之進行、及日蘇其他懸案之解決、乃屬無可否認之事、「報知新聞」又稱、有田外相以爲日本對美蘇兩國問題、均能調整不至衝突、幷信日本對蘇問題能在反共協定範圍內調整之、且對美國不至衝突云、（十九日合眾社電）</p>
<p>東京　日本外務省發言人須磨彌吉郎評述「報知新聞」所載關於日本與美國及蘇聯談判消息聲稱、「日本與美國及蘇聯同時舉行談判、不見有何技術上衝突、」但承認有心理上之困難、須磨聲稱、日本外相有田與美國駐日大使格魯會晤之期尚未決定、或在一月廿六日（一九一一年日美商約滿期日）之前舉行、（十九日合眾社電）</p>
<p>東京　外務省發言人今日在招待新聞記者席上聲稱、日蘇談話與美日會議根本無關、報紙所傳有關一說、實屬不確云、發言人答覆外籍記者問話稱、日本切欲對各國連同美蘇在內、抱「善鄰政策、渠希望一月二十六日（現存之美日商約滿期之日）前、將在東京與華盛頓舉行美日談話數次、外相有田昨日接見美大使格魯、及他國外交代表、但此乃禮節上之舉、故有田未與格魯討論任何事情云、（十九日路透電）</p>

<p>東京　日本新內閣於十六日首次閣議後、連日召開閣議、對當面之議會對策、關於議會休會之繼續並政務官問題等協議後、因已得成案、並將於二十二日起亘三日間更開連續閣議、於新內閣內外施政之全般予以重要檢討、米內首相正對事變處理·對第三國關係調整·國內問題解決之三原則確立邁進、其不動之國策先就（一）援助中國「新中央政府」之成立已決定、（一）對美對蘇對英對德之外交調整、（一）戰時國內經濟問題之解決等諸問題、慎重加以檢討、特別對於前內閣以來爲重懸案之貿易省問題、官吏制度之刷新等諸案件、更以新的角度加以考慮中、此等重要國策一旦決定時、當於二月一日議會再開時、將由劈頭之首相施政方針演說·藏相之財政演說·外相之外交演說、以闡明中外、（十九日同盟電）</p>
<h3>美報認日　求和心切　軍事一籌莫展</h3>

<h3>越界築路交涉　警務問題將妥協　由雙方合組新警務機關　收捐懸案亦將相繼解決</h3>
<p>公共租界工部局與偽市府間之越界築路問題談判、現正由費利浦總辦與傅筱庵討論一新政策之組織、以之管理越界築路地區行政、該新組織、可於二月底前成立、茲將詳情分述如次、</p>
<p>雙方談判　傳將解決</p>
<p>大陸報云、昨（十八日）、工部局總辦兼總裁費利溥、與「上海市長」傅筱庵刻正從事談判、茍非發生未可逆料之嚴重阻碍、則二月底以前、將有一新的警務機關、接管本市越界築路區域、該機關之組織及此警務力之管理兩節、業已擬定、雖未經任何一方正式接受、但聞已得工部局與「上海市府」之核准、</p>
<p>雙方合組　警務機關</p>
<p>該機關將定名為「越界築路警局」、由工部局警務處與「上海市府」聯合管理、爭執年餘之越界築路全區、均將在該新機關管轄之下、警務方面、如獲妥洽、則工部局所遇關於極重要的越界築路問題之兩項懸案、其一即告解決、</p>
<p>收捐問題　亦可妥協</p>
<p>雙方並於若干時日前開始討論該區收捐事之另一懸案、以期獲取解決、聞雙方對此問題將緊隨警務和解之後、而獲妥洽、</p>
<p>偽府派員　充警務長</p>
<p>昨日所得消息、據越界築路警局、將由「上海市府」所遴選之警務長為首腦、副警務長則由工部局委派、此外、總部人員將有四十人、雙方各派半數、彼等之姓名、須於最後委派之前、互相交換、而工部局與「上海市府」均保留拒絕對方所派任何人之權</p>
<p>數項詳則　尚未商妥</p>
<p>上項組織、雖經雙方核准、但有數項詳則、尚未互相商妥、聞工部局今要求予該新機關以全權、警務處亦感覺此新警務力一旦管轄該區、即不能放任該區中種種罪惡場所繼續活動、</p>
<p>歹土罪惡　一律剷除</p>

<p>又據章華毛絨紡織公司來函云、「本月十八日告報載有寗波不准進口貨品、係航運處列表公告、敝公司出品亦在被禁之列、閱之不勝詫異、查敝公司上海特區新廠出品、業經呈奉經濟部發給國字第一五六·一五七·號國貨證明書、並准予運銷內地有案、諒該處未悉詳情、致有誤會、深恐外界不明真相、函請賜予照登、以免混淆」、</p>
<h3>美大使將與　滬外交界接觸　昨接見加藤與貝克上校　自稱赴漢僅係游歷性質</h3>
<p>美駐華大使詹森、於十八日晨乘艦抵滬後、終日忙碌異常、除上午十時在華懋飯店接見高斯總領外、復於十一時在大使辦公室延見日本特使加藤、相談約二十分、大使復於當日下午會見美新任駐滬第四海軍聯隊司令貝克上校、</p>
<p>週一赴漢</p>
<p>大使在滬、渡過星期休假、定於二十二日偕同美揚子江巡選指揮司令官葛拉斯福少將、乘美艦呂宋號由滬西上、巡視南京·蕪湖·九江等地之僑務情形、然後在漢晤見美駐漢總領事、聽取現狀之報告、美艦「沃湖」號屆時隨同大使赴漢、以資護衛、抵漢後、以代瓜姆號離漢之缺、大使定二月六日返抵此間、</p>
<p>外交活動</p>
<p>留滬期內、大使將有外交方面之活動、與各國外交界方面作常例之交接、然後候輪赴港飛渝、會晤英法大使、處理公務、據大使語人、此行來滬、與下週赴漢再返重慶、並無特殊意義、僅係例行公務而已、對政治問題、不欲有所發表、</p>
<p>關念美商</p>
<p>大使此行赴漢、猶為日軍佔領揚子江後、各國大使中之第一人、雖大使表示、渠與葛拉斯福少將乘艦赴漢、係常例之巡視、不含特殊意味、對日方開放揚子江下游問題、並無相互關係、但一般人咸信、大使遽行有赴揚子江之行、對於美僑之現狀、及開放後之趨勢、與美國在揚子江之貿易問題、必因此行、而有所研究、得一參考、並將決定日方曾願考慮關於長江美商之千餘噸柴油出口問題、</p>

<h3>美女被毆事件　日方正式道歉　美領署認為並不滿意　採取何種行動未決定</h3>
<p>英文大美晚報云、關於美僑唐納遜女士被日哨兵毆擊事、美總領事已接日方之道歉、但認為並不滿意、唐女士昨日（十八日）前往美領署時、有備勳章而懸刀之日海軍軍官兩員、向唐女士口　道歉、唐女士經領署官員所囑、不得向</p>
<p>新聞記者發言、據美領事署波特烈克聲稱、「餘準備奉告者、僅美領署已接日總領署所發關於此案之函件一通而已、」或問此事已否解決、波氏答稱、關於此案尚未決定行動云、日方發言人招待新聞記者時、曾對唐女士所稱在</p>

<h3>日人強佔內地小麥　麵粉廠難開工　存貨售罄後有關閉虞　澳麥美麥價格均激漲</h3>
<p>大陸報云、某華人麵粉廠主昨（十八日）告記老稱、今內地已無小麥運來、且自歐戰爆發以還、澳麥與美麥價格均告飛漲、致本埠麵粉廠處境危急、機器工作者僅四分之一、存貨售出後、即有關閉之虞云、該廠主雖未言明何以無麥運來、但外傳日人竭其所能、</p>
<p>強佔小麥</p>
<p>之說、由得證實、該廠主績稱、上海有麥、約司支持五月、屆時局面無變化、則麵粉廠將無以爲繼、澳麥美麥價格騰貴、其故在滙率低落、與運費高漲、而美國歉收、則有使美麥價格、自目前之每布什爾美金一元、</p>
<p>漲至三元</p>
<p>之虞、雖然、聞本月內已有澳麥兩萬噸運滬、且不久　有績購者、中國輸入之麥、大多來自澳洲、平時上海廠家於十月左右本國麥告缺時、開始採購澳麥、惟本年因滙率低落、故於一月份即</p>
<p>開始購辦</p>
<p>一九三八年間、本埠麵粉廠於戰後漸决復原、竭力清理存貨、是年外麥輸入中國者、僅一千七百公斤、但去年因本國麥缺乏、乃購外麥、結果據海關數字所示、輸入外麥、計四六七·〇八三·五〇〇公筆、內來自澳洲者佔二九六·七二一·四〇〇公斤、而去年上半年輸入中國之麥、什七來自澳洲、</p>
<h3>吳淞　炸彈爆發　斃築路小工三人　已受重傷者二人</h3>

<h3>長江水位暴跌　日輪止於蕪湖　蕪湖黃石港間用小輪駁儎　黃石港至漢口須另用駁船</h3>
<p>長江上游水位、每至冬季、必然减退、江輪行駛困難、自國軍西移後、漢口以下長江全綫被日海軍控制、外輪航運全遭排斥、日輪獨享其利、茲據航業消息、今歲冬季、長江水勢銳减、在黃石港一段更甚、近祇水深六尺、東亞海運公司（即前日淸公司改組）長江班各輪、已不能駛漢、較大者至蕪湖爲止、蕪湖黃石港間、由前行駛川湘江輪雲陽丸·當陽丸·宜陽丸·淺水·等行駛駁載貨件、惟黃石港至漢口間、再須另用駁船轉載、以小火輪拖漢、照上述情形、可見今冬長江水勢之淺涸、</p>

<h3>西伯利亞高氣壓　本埠影響極微　向東南東推進侵襲東四省　本埠天色陰霾尙無降雪意</h3>
<p>本埠昨日天氣、微受西伯利亞高氣壓影響、比較趨寒、今明氣候、尚將轉冷、大通社記者茲分述如次、</p>
<p>高壓向東南進行</p>
<p>據徐家匯天文臺消息、西伯利亞現有高氣壓發生、當地氣溫劇降、祗攝氏零下四十七度、海參崴氣候亦祗攝氏零下十九度、平津氣候、雖亦略受西伯利亞高氣　影響、最低溫度、爲攝氏零下七度左右、</p>
<p>上海未受直接影響</p>
<p>因西伯利亞高氣壓現向東南東進行、並不向南南東推進、故其所受影響之處、爲東四省一帶、上海可免被所襲、昨日氣溫雖似略低、惟最低仍有攝氏零上三度一、華氏爲三十七度六、最高爲攝氏零上七度二、華氏爲四十五度、故影響極微、</p>
<p>推測天氣難飄瑞雪</p>
<p>又據天文台推測、今明本埠天氣尚將趨寒、然亦不至呈酷冷程度、昨日天色雖呈陰霾、大有釀雪之意、惟全國各地氣象報告、並無降雪之處、由是推斷、本埠似尚無飄揚瑞雪希望、果爾、則田疇將見害蟲叢生、旣足影響春耕、於攝生方面、爲害亦滋多、</p>

<h3>疋頭　棉布內銷　相形見絀</h3>
<p>棉布國外香港南洋一帶走銷暢達、市勢活潑、惟內銷則相形見細、蓋總結束期已近、本客帮銀根軋緊、故廠盤雖步開步昂、而手貨獲利按市廉脫者亦不尠、各貨市盤頗不一致、相差每疋一角至五角不等、昨市開價平平、怡和·華新·振中等廠出品粗布細布二月份貨開出二千餘件、較現市高角半至五角、本街漂染印花廠辦進以坯布數量最巨、的四五萬疋、粵帮辦粗布·漂布·色斜·色布二百餘件、浙贛帮辦細布·漂布·條漂綸昌花色貨近二百件、杳港南洋　辦粗布·斜紋·漂染·印花布三萬數千疋、二十日疋頭運香港二百八十件、運天津一千一百件、運烟台七百件、</p>

<p>小談</p>
<h3>掩耳盜鈴</h3>
<p>— 黃嘉音</p>
<p>凡是犯法的人，不管張三李四，不論阿貓阿狗，一把抓來，就是扔到圍墻高高，鐵鬥重重的黑牢裏去。這也許是對待「社會罪人」的最簡捷了當的辦法，可是却不是最文明最合理最妥當的辦法。</p>
<p>現代心理學，犯罪學，社會學都進步了。我們曉得犯罪的人，多數是被環境的引誘與壓迫所致，也有因爲敎育不得法，習慣不好，身體不健全而犯罪的。祇有極少數的人因爲遺傳不良而犯法。</p>
<p>對於受環境的引誘與壓迫的人，我們應該改變他們的環境；敎育不得法或未受敎育者，我們應該施以正確的敎育，習慣不好的人，應該帮助他們去改變習慣，身體不健全就應該醫治他們的病態。如果始終像現在這樣不分皂白地把所有的「社會罪人」都關在一起，關到「刑滿」就放出來，以後的生死都由他去了，這豈不是有類乎掩耳盜鈴的舉動？這樣監獄不客滿才怪呢！</p>

<h3>通訊戰時的柏林  東林　　自從大戰發生以來，已經有三四個月了。在柏林最感到恐慌的，要算是食物的缺乏。猪肉和牛肉已經完全得不到，所有的只是鹿肉，野猪肉和野鴨肉吧了。這些都是從獵區和森林裏獵取來的。然而對於一般人，這不但不配胃口，並且價錢也大得嚇人。　　主婦們每天要費數小時去排着隊買食品，假使有客人來了，倘使沒有帶着菜餚來，老實不客氣只好給他餓着回去。大多數柏林的居民，天還沒有黑就都回到家裏，在不漏光的燈下呆坐着。外邊是不敢出去的了。　　德國人每個月只能得着一塊肥皂，因此沒有充分的肥皂可以用來剃鬍鬚，弄得大多數男人都是滿面鬍鬚。有趣的是，希特勒少女團裏最近規定不許拒絕和滿面鬍鬚的男人接吻。　　入口稅漲了百分之五十，捲烟稅漲了百分之二十，而啤酒稅漲了百分之十四。所以柏林的人們不但買不起洋貨，就連香烟和啤酒也吃不起了。　　戰爭使神女們的營業也受到極大的影響。因爲天一黑，男人們都不高興到黑沈沈的街上去，而大多數壯丁又都到戰塲上去了。　　電台沒有固定的節目可以播送，所有的都是政府的報告，加强戰鬥意識的談話和宣傳，而在其間的時間廣播着進行曲和古典音樂。　　報紙的頁數减少了一半，而沒有一種報紙不是老登着同樣的消息。內容無非是公式化的政府公告，維持着友好關係之各國對德國的評論，以及攻擊英國的記事。他們只把英國當做死對頭，對於法國却不大講壞話。　　衣服和食物同樣感到缺乏。男人們祗許有二套西裝，四件汗衫，和六雙襪子。倘使要買新的話，就得拿了舊的去買　　對猶太人的虐待一天比一天厲害起來。大家都擔心着不要於最近的將來連其他的外國人也會遇到同樣的待遇。　　德國的人們都守着緘默，面上露着悲痛的表情。對於戰爭好像都不感到熱心，並且也不大喜歡談論戰爭的事。在街上或公共塲所會到面時，大家只是沒精打彩地招呼着吧了。驚弓之鳥  夢谷　　在倫敦的街上。一聲霹靂大雷的響聲，把路上一位太太嚇得喊了起來。　　路旁一位頑童脫口而出說，『太太，不要怕，不是希特勒，是上帝。』修養空閒的修養  K　　我們發表這篇文章的意思，不是提倡空閒，而是提倡空閒的修養。我們覺得空閒是每個活着的人所應有的權利，而空閒的修養是一種人生的藝術。　　編者　　世界上有兩種人最可憐：一種人自朝至暮，事情忙個不了，還有一種人白天黑夜無事他忙個不了，他們都沒有機會享受閒散的幸福，所謂閒散和懶惰不同：懶惰是有着正當的事不做，就是不盡職；閒散是應做的事做完了之後剩餘的空閒光陰，這種剩餘的光陰如何利用，那就是人生幸福或苦痛的源泉。　　享受空閒不是一樁容易的事，但是你應當試一試，因爲不如此，你决無他法求得一種涵養，使人生產生一種精力，以應付艱巨的事業；你决無他法輕輕的叩動精神的源泉，換句話說，你須先得着一種有不爲的智職，然後纔能有爲。　　工餘之暇，看電影，跳舞，打高爾夫球，開汽車散步，這些都不是眞正享受閒散，眞正的空閒，條件甚簡單：要使緊張的筋肉鬆懈，要停止有所爲的思想，須暫時變成一片隨風飄盪的楓葉，或者像一塊頑石，你須把文化人有計畫的活動，有計畫的思想，種種使人疲乏的習慣，換取精神上的優游自在，質言之，你須一無所爲。你學會了這一套的時候，你的意識界將開闢一種新天地，身心安寗淸醒，爲有生以來所未有，這種境地具有一種不可比疑的疲勞精神的復蘇力。　　你如其戴着眼鏡，把牠們取下，那個架在鼻樑上的輕小壓力也足以引起苦惱的。你的袴帶領帶也須解鬆，然後平臥下來，休息着。一點不要轉甚麼念頭，你的精神就任便　　起來了，你那新近解放的意識上就會立刻發生　種半明半暗的思想，各種回憶和覺醒也隨之湧出，因爲你的思想的壓制和行爲的壓制現在都已消敗，你的精神就有機會領會那好像瓶裏的花香了。這種花香原已瀰散在房間裏的，不過因爲你的精神不自由，未能　得罷了，優游的精神具有一種神秘的感覺力，此種花香就會深深的吸入肺腑，　並且就會有另外一種感覺，覺得陽光射在你手上，到那種境地時，鼻孔裏充滿着花香，皮肉上感覺着陽光，世界並不怎樣惡劣了。你畢竟進入了一種可愛的秘密的境地，唯有懂得空閒的修養者始能問津，回復到這神寗靜的生活，實爲一種値得學習的修養。隨筆蛛網  品品　　屋隅，桌底，床頭，櫥邊，蜘蛛結了網。蜘蛛蹲在網中央，屁股朝天，不動一動。網的樣子，是一個幾何圓形，隨風輕搖，鳶子似的，不過常零亂地掛着幾點飛塵。　　我是一個非常憎厭蛛網的人。阿爾佛列德王（KingAlfred）不知受了什麼啟示才從蛛網裏領會出一個敎訓，我想這大槪是一個傳說而已，世界上沒有人歡喜這髒的醜的東西。　　不用說別的，蛛網是個髒東西。滿淸潔的屋子，東掛一個網，西結一張羅，黏着塵埃，一串串，一球球，屋子生了許多瘡，一摸一大把汚穢。這東西不使人情厭，還有什麼？明亮，像太陽穿過水晶一樣明亮，淸潔，像蓮花瓣上的露珠一樣淸潔，這才是做人的方法，骯髒要不得的。　　蛛網也是醜的。隱在暗處，臨風招展，無辜的小蛾飛蟲，或者沒有經意，或者給網的花紋引誘，投了進去，給那個大魔王吃掉。蜘蛛大了，吃了人家的血大了。如果定神看新蜘蛛，你會吃驚的，你不相信有別的動物比牠更怪的，像章魚，像蟹，又像蜈蚣——魔鬼的影子。生了這怪東西，醜東西，能袖手任牠囂張嗎？　　腌　的，誘人的，吸血的，怪誕的，魔鬼的蛛網，讓我們把牠掃去，還我們的淸潔，自由，幸福，解放！　　所以，我一見到蜘網，我就要用火燒——我覺得用竹竿去挑，處罰太輕。我點了火，照準蜘蛛的腹部燒去，眞快，不等逃，一聲「嗤」響了，蜘蛛一個倒栽葱跌了下來，脚碎了，頭縮了，只有最後的一根細絲懸在尾巴。滿想憑了脆弱的網獨霸一方，蜘蛛終於爲了貪饜死在火的下面。是的，火是光明與奮鬥的記號，不用火，魔王赶不掉。　　光明與奮鬥的火呀！我們將多麼感謝你，因爲你把可惡的怪物驅逐出去，粉碎了牠。柏羅米修斯的子孫，應該用火來跟黑暗勢力鬥爭的，像我用火焚毀蛛網一樣。科學電木飛機  節流　　電木的用途極廣，可是用它來製造飛機，却是一樁新興的事業。　　普通金屬的飛機，很難製造，一則金屬終嫌太重，二則飛機上面的零件，例如鉸釘等，裝配手續非常麻煩。因此，有一輩飛機爲人，便試用電木來製造飛機了。　　幾年以前，美國曾經製成一架電木飛機，英國的張伯倫首相曾經試飛乘過，甚覺滿意。最近美國的葛拉克氏，也造成了電木骨架的飛機多架，而他所用的電木，叫做Duramold。　　葛拉克的飛機，馬力爲四百匹，全部純用電木和布製造，機身光滑異常，絕不像金屬飛機那麼全身到處是釘，飛機的骨架互相溶連在一起，因爲電木的質料是有黏性的。因此機身堅固異常，而目因爲電木不會燃燒，又不像金屬那麼有劇烈的震動，所以不易損壞，乘容坐在其中，亦頗舒適。　　據說製造這種電木飛機的骨幹，只需兩小時的功夫，便能全部製竣，可是怎樣製造，當局極守秘密，外界無從探悉。　　葛拉克式的電木飛機，可容乘客五人左右，其飛行速率，較之普通飛機，可以增加百分之七，飛機重量也較普通飛機爲小，可是電木飛機還在試騐改良之中，如果能够大規模地製造，那麼目今的金場飛機，必將受淘汰了。談資  太洛　　太陽每廿四小時散發熱度三百六十兆噸。如果想用人工做成同量的熱度，每分鐘內要燒三萬萬兆噸的煤。　　現在德國共有醫師五萬五千二百五十九位，其中女性占四千三百三十九位。過去的兩年間，男女醫師的增加率是百分之六，女醫師的達百分之十九以上。</h3>

<p>㳺藝界從楊寶森掛頭牌　說到二牌老生之需要  碧玉　　北平傳來的消息，鬚生楊寶森由滬返平後，已決計自張一軍，現已開始組班，乃兄楊寶忠且因此與馬連良拆夥，預備弟兄合作，為寶森操琴。實森之班，已邀妥旦角胡碧闌加入，不日即將在平出演云云。　　關於楊寶森組班的消息，令人悲喜交併，喜的是寶森此後能不再寄人籬下，悲的是在此二牌老生寥若晨星局面之下，寶森可謂此中之鳳毛麟角，一旦組班，二牌老生勢必更無相當人選矣。　　老生組班，此風始自馬連良，（余叔岩全盛時代，非與小樓合作，即與蘭芳合作，未嘗自張一軍，有之亦不過出演一二塲而已。）連良之後，言菊朋繼之而起，以後更有李盛藻，譚富英以老生之紛紛獨立，旦角深恐掛刀無人，於是四大名旦，乃邀有私房二牌老生，所謂私房二牌老生者，即專為此一旦角配戲，而不搭別班也，此即所謂梅之與奚嘯伯，程之與王少樓；苟之與王文源；尚之與王鳳卿是也。此四人中，除奚嘯伯因梅不出演，亦自行組班外，餘二人與旦角訂有合同，不得再與其他角兒合作，換言之此三人一事亦無組班之可能，但正因此二牌老生乃益見缺少矣。　　論今日之二牌老生，尤推楊寶森為最紅最佳之一人，故一般角兒，邀請老生，多爭聘寶森，由時勢之造成，寶森雖名為二牌老生，其聲勢之大，遂不亞於頭牌老生之奚嘯伯李盛藻羣也。寶森之藝，確多可取，但能挑班號召觀眾之戲並不多，故以情理而論，此時之寶森，尚不應自行組班也。除寶森外，陳少霖亦北方二路老生中之佼佼者，為少霖之嗓音極窄，致一般名伶如王玉蓉南鐵生等人，多邀管紹華前次來滬，雖未走紅，但在北方，極為一般人所賞識。加之紹華脾氣好，價錢巧，乃成目前二牌老生中最忙之一人，紹華外，尚有一賈少棠，其藝遠不及紹華，貫大元亦為二牌老生中負嘉譽者，今既南來，二牌老生中，無形缺一人才，常立恒與黃玉麟合作，雖為二牌老生，但北方伶人邀之合作者少，張如庭似不在平。最近宋德珠出滬返平，鬚生一角，邀就馬德成，馬本黃派武生，今靜兼工老生，北方二牌老生人才之缺乏，概可想見矣。㳺踪藝　舞女淚  小田　　　　一個同是父母生養出來的人，為什麽她做小姐，受着許多人的尊敬，我做舞女，受着許多人的侮辱；她生來就聰明，我生來就愚蠢嗎？每當夕陽西下的時候，我剛從被窩裏鑚出來，匆匆忙忙地向理髮店去，看着一羣一羣的學生，正自提着書包，有談有笑地奔向他們的歸途。我想今生今世，我是享不到這種幸福的了。她們衣食住行的問題，爸爸和媽媽早已替她們安排妥帖了，有不識的字，可以問爸爸，不懂的事，可以問媽媽，懶得做的事情，可以使喚傭人。冷了熱了餓了病了，那一樣沒有人當心着，招呼着。我們呢，在舞塲裏坐了冷板凳回去，本就悶着一肚皮的氣，親娘呢，免不了要絮絮叨叨的嘮叨一陳，可是明天，明天還得要上塲去。絲襪不能不穿，高跟皮鞋不能不着，手提皮包不能不拿，衣服不能不翻花樣，胭脂花粉不能不搽，理髮店不能不去，手指甲不能不修，目下　　百物昂貴　　，單購買盒嘴唇膏，也要化上三五元錢，總算起來，一個月怕不要化上三五十元，陪人家跳七八十和一百次的舞，還恰恰夠本錢，你想這生意好做不好做呢。再講紅了些罷，一天到晚，忙得發慌，跳得腿　，倒也算分內之事。有時碰着幾個客人同時喊坐檯，喊出去吃飯，倒底敷衍了那一位好，那綫為難煞人呢。有時一個不留意，得罪了客人，挨人家冷嘲熱罵坐冷檯子等等，都是免不了的，說不定挨記把耳光，也祇能自己痛苦一塲。還有一種人，裝着笑臉陪他白跳舞，還不算數，總要給他揩些特別油，即使給他如了願，仍不免要對人說得我們一個錢糖都不值，難道我們就天生是個下賤種子嗎？有人說，你們紅了，別的不說，錢總可以多積幾文了，真是說來也不相信，我們能多置些首飾衣服，就算好的了，媽還是第一個要錢，爸爸也要錢，兄嫂弟妹，要得最狠的就是男人，（原來舞女家中，有小半數都養着漢子，其中有已婚的，有未婚的，也有僅祇同居關係的。）我們也曾仔細的想過，要是不嫁人，年紀衰老不能賣色相的時候，靠什麽人來照顧？親娘總比自己先死，假娘呢，你不能替她掙錢時，他還和你有什麽感情。嫁給有錢人做小吧，他家裏早已妻兒滿堂，也不見得容許你同住，就是勉強住進去了，也免不得受人家的嫉　，輕賤和侮辱。另外住吧，自身在法律上根本就沒有地位，有錢人的性情大概流動的多，他一旦又愛上了別人，就哭死在他面前，也免不了要被拋棄，那時如果年紀還輕，還可以重操舊業，勉強生活下去，要是年華老大了，那　真個　　呼　無門　　呢。嫁貧漢，唉，養漢，是多麼難聽的名詞，不但名氣不好聽，就講實在，自身好比鮮花一般，白白給他蹂躪，掙錢來養活他，雖然，他也會獻些像倒臉水擦皮鞋一類的小殷勤。至於說將來呢，一個人連自己都養不活，將來就能希望他養活妻子了麼？所以終日昏昏的過一天算一天，倒也不覺得什麽，每常夜深人靜，獨自捫心，想到了終身問題，真個似萬箭攢心，白瞪着眼睛看天亮。張翠紅　最末次作品  元紅　　古典美人張翠紅，因為外子徐亨（不是守球門的運動健將）不願她嬌弱的身軀卜晝卜夜地從事攝影塲工作，所以早就勸她息影家園，張小姐對於［外子］的美意，全部接受，不過這次［中國聯美］的處女作［梁山伯與祝英台］，卻又是她的主角，這是有點理由的。　　［中國聯美］由嚴春堂張善琨吳邦藩　毓英李大深嚴幼祥等影界巨頭聯合創立，目的是謀電影界的澈底合作，所以導演演員都由各公司中聘請過來，女主角祝英台，各巨頭的意見認為以張翠紅最為合格，所以就以全體的面子誠意相請，張翠紅雖然已無意銀幕工作，而礙於這許多人的盛情，也就不得不勉為其難。所以這部戲許是張翠紅末一次的作品了。三年五載之後或許會重行出出，可是至少三年五載之中，我們將不會看到她的新作品了吧。早生貴子一片描寫各種婦女對於生育子女之心理，上圖為蓋片的一幕。壺齋曲話  蘇少卿　　赤髪鬼劉唐為尺八腿之誤（上）　　水滸一書，描寫人物入妙，一百〇八人各具性情口吻，戲曲採用此書故事最多，三十六天罡最著名，因此三十六人之名姓綽號載於眾人　記小說，蓋確有其人也。然綽號及人名各青頗異同，今撮舉數人，以搏一笑。烏龍院坐樓殺惜一劇，其前有劉唐下書，劉唐綽號赤髪鬼，見於宜和遺事，水滸亦然。劉寶唱大鼓烏龍院有句云：［赤髪鬼小劉唐他把者來下，］（按大鼓係宗水滸故事，句中加一小字，乃說唱戲湊句子之用，）據南宋周密之　辛雜識續集有一節，轉載襲聚與所作宋江等三十六人贊，第六名節尺八腿劉唐，贊云：［將軍下短，書稱侯王，汝　非夫，腿尺八長，］意調劉唐之腿短至一尺八寸，故號尺八腿，非赤髪鬼也。襲氏曾見高如李崇貫三十六人像者，謂劉唐腿短必不誤，尺八腿與赤髪鬼六字為雙聲　韻，髪字亦可讀八字音，而皆入聲字，鬼腿亦可同上聲，語呼改寫文字之誤，又未見畫像及襲氏周氏之記故也。</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>A Review of the Foundation of China's Legal Tender</h3>
<p>Last year, in the Shanghai black market, the British exchange rate once fell from over eight shillings to a mere three shillings, and the U.S. exchange rate fell from over fifteen yuan to a minimum of around six yuan. The surge was like the collapse of a raging tide, and people were panicked and at a loss. Consequently, those who doubted the credit of the legal tender resorted to unscrupulous means, without considering the consequences, focusing solely on evading funds. Moreover, there were many who took advantage of the opportunity to sabotage and reap the benefits. Furthermore, as the methods of "control" and extortion became tighter, the flames of speculation and hoarding flared up, leading to soaring prices, hardship for the people, and social instability. Some attributed this to the fall in currency value, inevitably leading to inflation, impossible to adjust, rampant price increases, impossible to stabilize, and rural decline, impossible to remedy. However, as evidenced by the facts, this is not only greatly mistaken, but the economic situation of China and Japan cannot be compared at all. This is not an exaggeration. The major changes in Shanghai's finance last year were initiated by a premeditated attempt to destroy China's entire financial structure, placing it in a position of eternal ruin, and achieving their ambition of dominating the situation temporarily. If Shanghai had not taken appropriate measures to deal with the rising exchange rate at that time, the foreign exchange reserve would inevitably have been swallowed up and consumed without remainder. Therefore, it was necessary for self-defense not to maintain the Shanghai foreign exchange rate, allowing it to rise and fall freely, in order to preserve China's financial vitality. This is truly the so-called enduring momentary pain to plan for the long term. If the legal tender had indeed reached an irreparable state, its external exchange rate would inevitably decline like a river flowing downstream, with no possibility of return. However, a look at the foreign exchange trend last winter shows that it not only recovered at times but was also exceptionally stable, which is clear proof of the soundness of the legal tender itself.</p>
<p>Even in terms of the amount of paper money issued, Japan has a population of 98 million, and the amount of paper money issued at the end of last year reached 3.8 billion yuan. China has a population of 460 million, and the amount of legal tender in circulation at the end of last year was only 3 billion yuan. Comparing population to population, Japan's population is only 21% of China's population. Comparing the amount of paper money issued, Japan issued 26% more paper money than China. Furthermore, in terms of reserves, Japan's 3.8 billion yuan in banknotes, according to foreign reports, only has 500 million yuan in gold reserves, accounting for only 13.16%. China's 3 billion yuan in legal tender has 1.546 billion yuan in cash reserves, reaching 50.17%. Comparing this to that, the foundation of China's legal tender is as solid as iron, while the reserves for Japanese banknotes are indeed very fragile. This is not a deliberate advertisement for China's legal tender. Examining the trend of the amount of Chinese paper money issued further clarifies that the aforementioned statement is not false. The amount of Chinese legal tender issued one month before the Lugouqiao Incident (i.e., June of the 26th year of the Republic of China) was 1.4 billion yuan. By the same period the following year (June of the 27th year), i.e., one year after the outbreak of the war, it was 1.76 billion yuan. At the end of June last year (the 28th year), it was 2.62 billion yuan. The increase of 860 million yuan in this year seems quite large. By the end of last year, it had increased by another 460 million yuan, resulting in a total issuance of 3.08 billion yuan. However, when considering the actual situation, the increase cannot be said to be large. The currencies in the southwestern provinces have always been extremely chaotic, with hard currency and local paper money mixed together. Since the National Government moved west, they have gradually been reorganized to achieve unification (i.e., legal tender). Therefore, the sudden increase in the demand for legal tender is only natural. The evidence for this is also very clear. In the past, the Bank of China issued the most Chinese paper money, so even the Central Bank was somewhat inadequate. The Bank of Communications and the Farmers Bank were even further behind. Until June of the year before last, the Bank of China's legal tender issuance was 650 million yuan, while the Central Bank still only had 490 million yuan. The trend had not yet changed. It was not until June of last year that the situation changed greatly. The Central Bank issued 1 billion yuan in paper money, while the Bank of China issued 700 million yuan. By the end of last year, the Central Bank had 1.34 billion yuan, while the Bank of China still only had 770 million yuan, exceeding the Bank of China by as much as 570 million yuan. This is probably because, due to historical reasons, the Bank of China has always been a financial giant in the southeast. With the outbreak of the war of resistance, the government and the people gradually moved inland. To meet the needs of the situation, the Central Bank naturally expanded its operations due to its position, and the issuance of banknotes naturally increased as well. Moreover, reorganizing the currency in the interior inevitably requires the recovery of a large amount of miscellaneous currencies, and what else can fill the gap but legal tender? Furthermore, due to restrictions on withdrawals and the impact of the war, there are many who hoard cash. To adapt to the needs of the local area, issuing a new portion of legal tender is also highly sought after by the citizens. This is the reason for the increase in paper money issuance. Given China's vast territory, large population, abundant resources, and diverse currencies, if legal tender can be fully implemented, the issuance of 3 billion yuan has not yet reached the saturation point. Moreover, this 3 billion yuan of legal tender still has a cash reserve of over 50%! Those who doubt the credit of legal tender can now be enlightened.</p>
<p>However, this credit cannot be achieved by luck. China's foreign trade has always been in a deficit position, but last year, even Shanghai, which consumes the most foreign goods, had a surplus. Is this not a great blessing? The recent balance of foreign exchange is also related to the decrease in import trade. Japan is not the same. Although it is also nominally in surplus, its foreign exchange trade, excluding the yen bloc trade, is still in deficit. Therefore, economic panic in their country is even worse than in China, which has suffered the destruction of war. Moreover, as the distribution center for Chinese native goods, Hong Kong's exports of Chinese goods through Hong Kong in the past eleven months were worth a total of 274 million Hong Kong dollars. The United States alone purchased 15 million U.S. dollars worth of tung oil last year. From this, it can be seen that the consolidation of China's legal tender is not without reason. Furthermore, as urban life is becoming increasingly difficult due to soaring prices, agricultural product prices are also rising at the same time, leading to a sudden increase in farmers' incomes, which is very different from normal times. Is it not today that we see "funds flowing to the countryside"? There are indeed things in the world that cannot be explained by conventional theories. Although the future is long, and the war has not yet ended, the current temporary favorable situation cannot be regarded as a final conclusion. However, based on past achievements and assessing future trends, we can hold an optimistic view without doubt.</p>
<h3>U.S. Senator Introduces Bill to Ban Export of Munitions and Raw Materials to Japan; Believes It is an Effective Action to Stop Aggression; The Public Opposes the Renewal of the U.S.-Japan Treaty of Commerce</h3>
<p>Washington. U.S. Republican Senator Capper introduced a bill in the Senate yesterday to impose a ban on the export of munitions and raw materials to Japan. He said that he does not advocate war with Japan, but "I solemnly declare that we must stop supplying Japan with our country's munitions for the purpose of aggression against China." Capper also requested that a letter from a voter protesting the renewal of the U.S.-Japan Treaty of Commerce be entered into the congressional record. He said that he had received hundreds of similar letters. Capper cited statistics on U.S. supplies of munitions to Japan: in 1937, the U.S. supplied 54% of Japan's munitions; in 1938, it was 56%; and in 1939, it increased to 80%. If the United States completely stopped supplying munitions, Japan's aggression against China would have to stop. Capper also said, "I sympathize with the tens of thousands of people in our country who abhor Japan's aggression against China. Therefore, I advocate that we must stop selling munitions to Japan and other aggressor nations." Capper also stated that his attitude was completely consistent with his previous vote against the Neutrality Act. (19th United Press dispatch)</p>
<p>Washington. According to merchants and official sources here, after the abrogation of the U.S.-Japan Treaty of Commerce, hundreds of Japanese merchants residing in the United States can continue to stay in the United States. As for new Japanese merchants arriving in the United States, they must be treated as tourists. Any new Japanese merchants arriving in the United States can only stay in the United States for two years, after which they must reapply; otherwise, they will be deported. The U.S. State Department made no comment on this matter. (19th United Press dispatch)</p>
<h3>Difficult to Break the Stalemate in Japanese Diplomacy; Pro-Soviet or Pro-American? Recognizing Psychological Difficulties</h3>
<p>Tokyo. Japan's "Hochi Shimbun" criticized the intentions of Japanese Foreign Minister Hachiro Arita today, claiming that both the United States and the Soviet Union harbor suspicion and exert pressure on Japan, leading to an adverse situation in Japan's relations with the two countries. The newspaper declared, "U.S. Ambassador to Japan Joseph Grew told former Japanese Foreign Minister Admiral Kichisaburo Nomura that the United States 'is extremely concerned about Japan's rapprochement with the Soviet Union.' This concern has led to unsatisfactory progress in U.S.-Japan commercial negotiations." The newspaper continued, "Conversely, the Soviet Union is also trying to prevent the adjustment of U.S.-Japan relations. It is undeniable that this attempt has affected the demarcation negotiations between 'Outer Mongolia' and 'Manchukuo' and the resolution of other pending issues between Japan and the Soviet Union." "Hochi Shimbun" also claimed that Foreign Minister Arita believes that Japan can adjust its relations with the U.S. and the Soviet Union without conflict, and believes that Japan can adjust its relations with the Soviet Union within the scope of the Anti-Comintern Pact, without conflicting with the United States. (19th United Press dispatch)</p>
<p>Tokyo. Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman Yakichiro Suma commented on the news published by "Hochi Shimbun" regarding negotiations between Japan and the United States and the Soviet Union, claiming, "There is no technical conflict in Japan holding simultaneous negotiations with the United States and the Soviet Union," but admitted that there are psychological difficulties. Suma claimed that the date of the meeting between Japanese Foreign Minister Arita and U.S. Ambassador to Japan Grew has not yet been decided, but it may be held before January 26 (the expiration date of the 1911 U.S.-Japan Treaty of Commerce). (19th United Press dispatch)</p>
<p>Tokyo. The Foreign Ministry spokesman stated at a press conference today that Japanese-Soviet talks are fundamentally unrelated to the U.S.-Japan conference, and the related reports in the newspapers are inaccurate. In response to questions from foreign reporters, the spokesman claimed that Japan sincerely desires to maintain a "good neighbor policy" with all countries, including the U.S. and the Soviet Union. He hopes that several U.S.-Japan talks will be held in Tokyo and Washington before January 26 (the expiration date of the existing U.S.-Japan Treaty of Commerce). Foreign Minister Arita met with U.S. Ambassador Grew and diplomatic representatives from other countries yesterday, but this was a matter of courtesy, so Arita did not discuss anything with Grew.

<h3>Japanese Cabinet Eagerly Seeks to Create a Puppet New Regime; Convening a Meeting of the Asia Development Board</h3>
<p>Tokyo. Prime Minister Yonai stated clearly in his first statement after forming the cabinet on the 16th that the handling of the China Incident would be based on established policy, and that the purpose would continue to be to fully support the establishment and development of the "New Central Government" of China. Now that the Wang-Wang-Liang Qingdao meeting has decided to be held recently, the Japanese government authorities convened the first meeting of the new cabinet's Asia Development Board at the Prime Minister's official residence at 2:00 p.m. this afternoon. Those attending included Prime Minister Yonai, Minister of Finance, Minister of the Army, Minister of the Navy Yoshida, and Kawa Yanagawa, Director-General of the Asia Development Board, who had previously attended the liaison department meeting of the Asia Development Board in Nanjing. After listening to his report from the field in detail, they carefully discussed the policies for the Japanese side to support the new regime in the future. (19th Domei dispatch)</p>
<p>Tokyo. After the first cabinet meeting on the 16th, the new Japanese cabinet has held cabinet meetings every day, discussing measures to deal with the Diet, including the continuation of the Diet recess and the issue of parliamentary vice-ministers. As these issues have been resolved, a continuous cabinet meeting will be held for three days starting on the 22nd to conduct an important review of the new cabinet's internal and external policies. Prime Minister Yonai is working to establish the three principles of handling the incident, adjusting relations with third countries, and resolving domestic problems. The unwavering national policy has already been decided for (1) assisting in the establishment of the "New Central Government" of China, (2) adjusting diplomatic relations with the United States, the Soviet Union, Britain, Germany, and (3) resolving wartime domestic economic problems. These issues are being carefully reviewed. In particular, issues that have been heavily discussed since the previous cabinet, such as the problem of the Ministry of Trade and the reform of the civil service system, are being considered from a new perspective. Once these important national policies are decided, they will be clarified in the policy speech by the Prime Minister, the financial speech by the Minister of Finance, and the diplomatic speech by the Minister of Foreign Affairs at the reopening of the Diet on February 1, to clarify the situation both domestically and abroad.

<h3>American Newspaper Believes Japan is Eager for Peace; Military at a Loss</h3>
<p>Washington. (Washington Evening Star) Regarding Wang Jingwei's telegram to Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek seeking peace, it is tantamount to a confession by the Japanese side that it cannot resolve the China war. It is thinking of using other methods to achieve a face-saving peace. Furthermore, the Japanese troops currently in China are now in a dilemma, but the relations between Japan and the United States are extremely poor. If the United States implements an embargo on munitions and raw materials, Japan will collapse. Therefore, there are many reasons for the Yonai and Arita cabinets to seek peace, and the psychological desire for peace is also strong. Japan's desire to improve relations with the Soviet Union and Germany is also driven by its difficult situation. (16th United Press dispatch)</p>

<h3>Signs of Japan's Economic Difficulties Are Becoming Increasingly Evident; People's Livelihood is Difficult, and Anti-War Sentiment is Strong; Appealing to the Government to Devise Good Policies to Relieve the Suffering</h3>
<p>New York. An editorial in today's "New York Times" stated that the economic difficulties Japan is experiencing due to the war against China are becoming increasingly severe and evident, and can no longer be concealed. The recent change of cabinet in Japan is not unrelated to the expiration of the U.S.-Japan Treaty of Commerce and the failure to renew it, but it is also the result of Japan's increasingly severe economic difficulties, and one of the reasons is that the government's solutions to these difficulties have not been satisfactory. According to the "New York Times," prices in Japan have risen by 16% in the past six months, while the supply of various goods has also been decreasing. According to a Tokyo dispatch received by the "New York Times," a well-known Eastern economist said that as long as Japan continues its expansionist policies, shortages of goods and continued price increases are inevitable. The publication of this view was not only unheard of a year ago in Japan, but also never seen by the general public, but now it is openly expressed. From this, it can be seen how much economic hardship Japan is suffering. In other words, Japan's anti-war sentiment is rising. In short, the war against China has become a bottomless pit, and even if Japan pours as many soldiers and resources into it as possible, it will not be enough to fill it. This point seems to have been understood by the Japanese, but it is difficult to dismount from the tiger, and there is no way to save the situation." (19th United Press dispatch)</p>
<p>Tokyo. After the establishment of the Yonai Cabinet, various newspapers published commentaries on important issues in domestic and foreign affairs, asking how the new cabinet would respond. In general, the public expects the new cabinet to improve the people's livelihood and relieve the suffering of the people. For this reason, people from all over the country have written to the Prime Minister with various requests. The number of letters received at the Prime Minister's residence is piled up like a mountain. For example, a farmer in Aomori Prefecture in the north wrote, "Last year, we had a bumper harvest of oranges, but due to a lack of wooden boxes and nails, we were unable to pack and export them, and because they rotted over time, we had no choice but to endure the pain and not sell them, resulting in a huge loss. Please consider this." A villager in Nagoya City wrote, "As a result of the previous cabinet's controlled economy, we have to pay high prices to buy a small amount of feed needed for raising chickens, resulting in a sharp decline in income and great difficulties. Please amend the ban on the import of foreign feed so that we can buy sufficient feed at a lower price." A farmer in Niigata City wrote, "Last year's rice harvest was excellent, but most of it was purchased and transported out by the local authorities, and local farmers had to buy rice from other places." Retail merchants in Osaka City also wrote to the Prime Minister, expressing their deep dissatisfaction with the authorities' measures to control rice consumption, and said, "We really don't know what the Minister of Agriculture and Forestry is doing. We would rather distribute rice ourselves to regulate the market." People from Morioka Prefecture wrote, "The controlled economy measures implemented by the previous cabinet, especially the measures to increase coal production, have completely failed and have caused a coal shortage. We hope that the new government can correct this." In addition, lumber merchants in Akita Prefecture, wool weavers in Fukui Prefecture, porcelain merchants in Kanazawa Prefecture, silk merchants in Yokohama, match merchants in Kobe, iron smelters in Moji, coal miners in Fukuoka, and other people from all over the country have written to criticize the previous cabinet and request relief from the new cabinet in countless ways.

<h3>A Clever Wife Cannot Cook Without Rice: The Cabinet's Fate Can Be Foreseen, Causing Panic Among Japanese Superstitious Believers; Army Newspaper's Straightforward Commentary Receives Punishment</h3>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo - The cabinet formed by Admiral Yonai is regarded as inauspicious by superstitious believers, as the Japanese word "Yonai" sounds like "no rice." The background of Yonai's cabinet formation also adds to the panic of superstitious believers. The collapse of the Abe cabinet, as everyone knows, was intended to allow Army Minister Hata Shunroku to take office. Now, unexpectedly, the person chosen to form the cabinet is Yonai. The army is extremely resentful, feeling deceived. The army's newspaper, "Kokumin Shimbun," published a straightforward editorial criticizing the inappropriateness of the appointment, which has caused surprise in many quarters. However, the newspaper was punished with a ban on publication. The complexity of the situation when the news of Yonai's cabinet formation was announced can be seen in the fact that the Emperor took extraordinary steps within an hour of the announcement, summoning Hata Shunroku to the palace. According to "Asahi Shimbun," the Emperor instructed Hata Shunroku that day to find a way to get the army to support the new cabinet because the Emperor had already ordered Yonai to form the cabinet. Hata Shunroku, awed by the imperial order, replied that he would do his best to comply. That evening, Yonai met with Hata Shunroku again, asking for his cooperation to remain as Army Minister. Looking at the above situation, we might as well predict that we will see very interesting events in the Japanese political world again next spring, especially when the Diet reopens at the end of January.</p>
<h3>Japan Seeks to Prevent Malignant Inflation</h3>
<p>Tokyo - According to reliable sources today, Japan's new Prime Minister Yonai will announce the government's policy direction in the Diet on February 1. Before that, he does not intend to reveal any government policies. At the same time, the new cabinet plans to reduce the budgets of the army, navy, and other departments to prevent a malignant cycle of inflation, continued high prices, and a large shortage of raw materials. It is heard that the new Finance Minister Sakurai will draft a new budget. (United Press, 19th)</p>
<h3>Japan-British Association Holds a Grand Banquet, a Chorus of Goodwill</h3>
<p>Tokyo - At a banquet held by the Japan-British Association this afternoon to welcome the new military attache to the Japanese Embassy in Britain, Colonel Tatsumi Takau, and the Nogami couple who recently returned from a trip to Britain, speakers emphasized the friendship between Japan and Britain, and the opportunity to improve this friendship is in sight. The chairman was British Ambassador Sir Robert Craigie, and his wife was also present. The British Ambassador's speech expressed his pleasure at the gathering of attendees and mentioned the important work of Colonel Tatsumi Takau in the future, saying that military attaches can greatly assist in improving relations between the two countries. He continued, "According to recent Japanese newspaper reports, the improvement of Anglo-Japanese relations depends on Britain's awakening. I dare say that after the colonel takes office, he will see that our country not only understands the situation in Europe but also understands the situation in the Far East. This is not a matter of sleepwalking, but an attempt to make us compatible in areas where we are incompatible. What is incompatible is not temperament, as the British and Japanese are quite compatible in this regard, but rather some policy issues. This will be a matter of mutual concessions to achieve the wishes of those present. I will stop here, otherwise, I will be criticized for giving a political speech." (Reuters, 19th)</p>
<h3>American Oil Merchants Are Only Interested in Profit, Continuing to Supply Japan with Kerosene, No Different Than Abetting Tyranny</h3>
<p>Los Angeles - At a meeting of the Cole Committee today, Republican Congressman Hugh Futrell strongly attacked the United States for selling kerosene to Japan. However, Cranston, vice president of the Honolulu Consolidated Oil Company, vigorously defended this trade. According to Cranston, Japan purchases 100,000 barrels of kerosene here every day. If the United States were to stop this trade, the kerosene producers in this city would fall into "serious trouble." At this point, Hugh Futrell questioned Cranston, "However, is there no other way to maintain the lives of the people in our country other than helping others to kill people?" At this point, Cranston did not answer but said, "If we do not supply kerosene to Japan, Japan can still obtain kerosene from other countries." According to Hugh Futrell, "As far as I know, the price of kerosene supplied by Californians to Japan is even cheaper than the price obtained by consumers in Los Angeles. What is even more ridiculous is that the signs hung by the Los Angeles kerosene wells during Christmas, while acknowledging the birth of the Prince of Peace, the oil they refine day and night is used to slaughter unarmed Chinese people. This is too contradictory." (United Press, 19th)</p>

<h3>Borah's Condition Is Critical</h3>
<p>Washington - Senator William Borah, a well-known veteran American politician, suffered a cerebral hemorrhage due to a fall. He is unconscious with a high fever.

<h3>US Navy Expansion Plan: Chairman of the House Naval Affairs Committee Proposes Amendment, Reducing Expenses Without Weakening Expansion Goals</h3>
<p>Washington - Vincent, chairman of the House Naval Affairs Committee, notified the committee yesterday that he would amend the naval shipbuilding bill he had previously drafted. He reduced the funds listed in the original bill from $1,300,000,000 to $800,000,000 and reduced 34 destroyers. The original plan recommended building 77 ships, totaling 400,000 tons, increasing naval strength by 25 percent. Vincent's amended bill recommends building 41 ships, totaling 218,000 tons, including the construction of aircraft carriers totaling 75,000 tons, enough to build three aircraft carriers with a displacement of 24,000 tons. The amended bill stipulates the construction of cruisers totaling 110,000 tons, the size of which will be determined by the naval authorities. In addition, 34,000 tons of submarines will be built. The original plan stipulated the construction of 45,000 tons of submarines. (United Press, 19th)</p>
<p>Vincent also explained that although the funds have been reduced, shipbuilding projects that can be effectively managed can still be carried out. He said it would be unwise to accumulate too many projects without actually carrying them out. The method he proposed to reduce shipbuilding expenses is not intended to weaken the navy.

<h3>Military Supplies Cooperation Between Britain and France, Talks in London Have Ended, French Minister of Armaments Returns Home</h3>
<p>London - The French Minister of Armaments, Raoul Dautry, came here to talk with the British Minister of Supply, Burgin, to discuss the manufacturing of military supplies between Britain and France. The talks have been concluded, and he left for his home country this morning with his staff. (Havas, 19th)</p>
<p>London - An official communique was issued stating that the French Minister of Armaments, Raoul Dautry, and the British Minister of Supply, Burgin, studied the progress of the work of the Anglo-French Standing Committee on Military Supplies and decided on various necessary measures to intensify cooperation and ensure that Britain and France have sufficient supplies of ordnance. (Havas, 18th)</p>
<p>London - Before returning home, the French Minister of Armaments, Raoul Dautry, gave a statement to a reporter from the "Daily Telegraph," saying that in general, people use the word cooperation to describe the relationship between Britain and France, but in reality, the word cooperation is too light, and should be replaced by the word unity. The two countries are about to build many factories in their respective territories and send specialized personnel to work in each other's factories. All scientific experimental equipment, various machines, artificial economic and financial resources are mutually used. In a word, there is no longer any so-called secret or border between Britain and France. Dautry also told a Havas reporter that the discussions he had with the British Minister of Supply, Burgin, were like a family collaboration. The division of labor between the two sides was very harmonious and without any friction. As far as the situation of military equipment manufacturing is concerned, the efforts made by the United Kingdom have already achieved remarkable results, which is admirable. In short, the cause of Anglo-French cooperation will be maintained without fail. The two sides have reached agreements in all aspects, and this is the case now and will be the case in the future.

<h3>The German Government Issues Another Statement, France Should Bear the Responsibility for the War, Accuses France of Echoing the British Program, Franco-German Understanding Ruined in One Fell Swoop</h3>
<p>Berlin - The German government yesterday issued a second statement regarding the French Yellow Book, the original text of which is as follows: "According to the recent publication of the details of the visit to Paris by German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop in December 1938, it proves that in the winter of 1938, the preconditions for a permanent relaxation of tensions between Germany and France were already in place. Germany clearly expressed its abandonment of the demand to revise the western border, and the French Foreign Minister also announced that since the Munich Conference, France had completely changed its Eastern European policy and would not interfere in Germany's activities in Eastern and Central Europe. In other words, Germany and France mutually guaranteed not to infringe on each other's vital interests, and the dawn of Franco-German understanding appeared. Despite various objections within France, the French government did not abandon this policy until March 1939. On March 17, after Britain announced that the encirclement of Germany was its program, France blindly followed suit, and the opportunity for Franco-German understanding was ruined in one fell swoop. When Britain gave Poland a 'blank check,' France also signed it. When Britain unilaterally guaranteed Romania and Greece, France also endorsed it. France was actively involved in giving Turkey the Alexandretta issue and actively wooing Soviet Russia in order to complete the encirclement front, which shows that in the spring of 1939, France had destroyed the foundation of the Franco-German Declaration. On July 1, 1939, French Foreign Minister Bonnet met with German Ambassador Weizsäcker and gave him a written consultation, which he asked him to send to Foreign Minister Ribbentrop. In it, he stated that France had decided to maintain its promise to Poland under all circumstances. German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop wrote to the French Foreign Minister on July 13 of the same year, the original text of which is as follows: 'July 13, 1939, German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop respectfully writes to French Foreign Minister Bonnet, having received a letter from Your Excellency's Ambassador Weizsäcker on July 1, after reading it, I have to inform Your Excellency about the attitude of my government towards Franco-German relations and the Danzig issue. Since our two countries signed the Franco-German Declaration on December 6, 1938, we have mutually guaranteed that the borders of the two countries are final and committed ourselves to good neighborliness. My government is still willing to follow this policy today, but Your Excellency states that regarding the third clause of the Franco-German Declaration, the reservation on the relationship between Germany and France and third countries, my country believes that this reservation cannot be applied to Franco-Polish relations, because during the preparatory negotiations held in Berlin and Paris before the signing, and during the final signing in Paris, it was clearly understood that the so-called special relationship refers to France and Britain, Germany and Italy, which no other country can be mixed into. At that time, I also pointed out that in order to establish friendly relations between the two countries, it is necessary to respect each other's vital interests, pointing out that Eastern Europe is within Germany's sphere of interest. Your Excellency strongly stated at the time that after the Munich Conference, France's attitude towards the Eastern European issue had fundamentally changed, but Your Excellency's letter this time overturns the previous statement, stating that if the status quo of Danzig is changed, France will immediately provide Poland with military assistance. Regarding this point, I would like to state a few things on the left, (1) Germany has never interfered with France's vital interests, therefore, it firmly rejects such interference by France. German-Polish relations and the Danzig issue are issues of German policy and cannot be obstructed by France, (2) Regarding Your Excellency's question about Germany's attitude towards Poland, I can answer as follows: After Germany proposed a peaceful resolution to the German-Polish relations and the Danzig issue to Poland, Poland's reply, threatening war, was unexpected. It is not yet known whether Poland will revise this strange attitude. If Poland invades Danzig, Germany will immediately send troops to destroy the Polish army in response, (3) The last sentence of Your Excellency's letter, namely the military assistance to Poland, if it is the intention of French policy, then I inform Your Excellency that this threat can only strengthen the determination of Chancellor Hitler to defend Germany's interests with all his might. Chancellor Hitler believes that there is no conflict of vital interests between Germany and France, that is, there is no need for a second war. If France deliberately starts a war, then Germany is ready to fight at any time, but the responsibility for the war must be borne solely by the French government before France and all its people. When the Franco-German Declaration was signed, Your Excellency and I were in a good mood. This decision to be forced to disturb the situation is unavoidable, I hope you will consider it.'"</p>
<p>According to this document, the reason why the foundation of Franco-German understanding could not be successfully cultivated was that France followed British policy. France cannot shirk the historical responsibility for starting the war. (Haitong Press, 19th)</p>

<p>TASS Special Article - In 1939, Soviet medicine achieved great success. In ophthalmology, Soviet medical personnel devoted themselves to studying methods for treating "glaucoma" and "cataracts." "Glaucoma" is an incurable disease that can cause blindness. According to the research results of the Soviet medical community, the crux of this disease is not in the eye but in the nervous system and the brain. Regarding this point, the Soviet medical community is currently continuing its research and will soon obtain new treatment methods. Also, regarding "cataracts," only surgery can be used to treat them. In the past few years, Soviet medical personnel have experimented on animals with scurvy and found that the vitamin C contained in the aqueous humor of the eye has a very strong impact on the movement of the lens of the eye. After they discovered this, they believed that "cataracts" could be cured without surgery. In 1940, Soviet medical personnel will use vitamin C on a large scale to treat cataracts and prevent the occurrence of cataracts.</p>

<h3>If Northern Europe Is Invaded, Britain and France Will Never Stand By, The Same Measures Will Be Taken for the Near East, The Scope of British Aid to Finland Is Under Discussion</h3>
<p>London - The recent trade agreement between Britain and Sweden is highly valued by the general public here. It is said that Germany imports a large quantity of iron ore from Sweden every year for military industrial use. Until recently, this quantity had greatly declined. Now that the trade agreement between Britain and Sweden has been concluded, it will be gradually reduced, which shows that the negotiations conducted by Britain with the countries of the Scandinavian Peninsula are very successful. Responsible officials also said that if these countries are attacked, Britain and France will never stand by. The measures taken by Britain and France in recent days, especially the various measures regarding aid to Finland, are aimed at placing these countries in a more advantageous position so that they can be more effectively protected if the Nordic countries are invaded in the future. At the same time, the same measures will be taken for the countries of the Near East to ensure that Britain and France can immediately provide assistance if something happens to these countries in the future. (Havas, 18th)</p>
<p>London - Prime Minister Chamberlain replied to a written question in the House of Commons last night, stating that the issue of British financial assistance to Finland is currently under discussion between the British and Finnish authorities. The exact scope of necessary or possible assistance has not yet been determined. (Reuters, 19th)</p>
<p>London - The situation of British and French assistance to Finland has become increasingly active in recent days. It is heard that 150 to 200 new types of aircraft have been supplied, but it is unknown how they were transported to Finland. The assistance given by Sweden to Finland seems to be increasing. The Italian government has also apparently decided to provide assistance. It is heard that various military supplies are being transported to Finland by sea and air. (Havas, 18th)</p>
<p>Washington - Well-informed sources say that there is no sign of how the United States will provide assistance to Finland. It is extremely difficult to figure out how to dispel the doubts of the opposition. Certain important congressmen are trying to find a compromise solution, the content of which is nothing more than lending money to Finland so that it can purchase agricultural tools from the United States, and then use these agricultural tools to exchange for military supplies through the Anglo-French Purchasing Committee in the United States. (Havas, 18th)</p>
<p>New York - The New York Herald Tribune today commented on the issue of the United States lending money to Finland, saying that the fate of Finland is of special importance to the United States and urged the United States to provide assistance to Finland. The famous writer Dorothy Thompson said that if we refuse to lend money to Finland, it is tantamount to telling the world that the United States has concerns. (Reuters, 19th)</p>

<h3>Chen Lifu Issues Statement After Returning to Chongqing</h3>
<p>Chongqing: Minister of Education Chen Lifu returned to Chongqing on the 18th and issued the following statement: I flew from Chongqing to Yunnan on December 24th to attend the annual meeting of the Chinese Institute of Engineers. I took a car to Guizhou on January 5th and returned to Chongqing. The trip took about four weeks. In addition to attending the annual meeting in Kunming, I also took the opportunity to inspect primary schools and higher education institutions in Yunnan and Guizhou provinces and provided instructions based on the conditions of each school. I gave a total of seventy-two public speeches. In general, the teachers and students of each school were able to appreciate the great intention of the country in establishing schools and education, and I found a good spirit of striving, working hard, and enduring hardship everywhere. The students are also more serious and diligent in their studies than before, which is very gratifying. Although primary education in Yunnan and Guizhou provinces has shown progress, the treatment of teachers and the training of teachers still need to be improved and worked on. The relevant authorities in Yunnan and Guizhou are now paying close attention to this. As for secondary education, Yunnan Province should find ways to improve its quality, while Guizhou Province should actively increase both its quality and quantity. In addition, the teaching tools for natural sciences in various schools are mostly incomplete and need to be added and supplemented. The library and equipment of various universities are extremely lacking, and student management and military training also need to be improved. (Dispatch, 19th)</p>
<h3>Sichuan and Xikang Implement Thorough Opium Prohibition</h3>
<p>Chongqing: Opium prohibition in Sichuan is being carried out severely. Yesterday, a reporter learned that Li Huang, Director of the First Office of the Sichuan-Xikang Construction Promotion Association, and Huang Yanpei, Director of the Second Office, had successively come to Chongqing. A special visit was made to inquire about the opium prohibition situation in various places. They were informed as follows: The Sichuan-Xikang Construction Promotion Association offices have now been established separately. The scope of the work undertaken is based on the Sichuan-Xikang construction plan resolved by the Fourth National Political Council. However, when the council members were about to depart, the speaker proposed opium prohibition and bandit suppression as the most important tasks at present. Therefore, special attention was paid to these two points during inspections, supervision, and assessment. Observing the situation, the personnel responsible for opium prohibition in various places were awed by the speaker's determination to thoroughly prohibit opium, and they were able to uphold and practice it. The local gentry and the people were very excited to hear the meeting reports. This is indeed a good sign for the future of opium prohibition. Those who occasionally test the law will be reported to the government and punished according to the law, and will never be lenient, so that those who commit crimes will know to be vigilant. However, the century-old opium poison is deeply rooted. If we want to clear it up once and for all, we must make long-term and continuous efforts. Local gentry and people must work together to achieve thorough results. At this time, the government's thunderous authority has achieved a solid foundation for opium prohibition. (Dispatch, 19th)</p>

<h3>Price Controls on Grains in Beiping Temporarily Lifted</h3>
<p>Beiping: Reuters, according to reliable foreign sources, if the current shortage of flour continues, foreigners will feel inconvenience, or there may be concerns about not being able to obtain bread. Local merchants are now using their stocks. The situation improved slightly yesterday. According to an official announcement, price controls on grains have been temporarily lifted, and efforts are being made to import two million bags of flour before the Lunar New Year. Currently, due to price controls and the requisition of stocks by Chinese and Japanese authorities, Chinese residents, especially the poor, are unable to purchase grains. The official flour price limit is set at around eight yuan per bag, but merchants with stocks are still selling at a price of fifteen yuan per bag. Due to the deteriorating situation, the authorities have had no choice but to distribute food tickets to poor residents through the police. However, many abuses have been discovered, and residents are being charged for the food tickets distributed. Since the official control was lifted, the price of flour has increased by 15% yesterday, and then rose to 18 yuan per bag, but there is still no large quantity available for purchase. It is reported that there are still many flour stocks in Beiping, but they are being hoarded by many merchants to seek high prices. (Reuters dispatch, 19th)</p>

<h3>The Great Victory of Chinese Forces in Northern Guangdong; Japanese Forces Took a Risky Venture Through Xinfeng; Cut Off by Chinese Forces, the Entire Line Collapsed; Chinese Forces Buried More Than Three Thousand Japanese Corpses; Captured Military Supplies Worth Thirty Million Hong Kong Dollars; Countless Armored Vehicles, Tanks, Mules, and Horses</h3>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: In this battle, the Japanese army launched a three-pronged attack on northern Guangdong, with the right wing being the most fierce. This route of the Japanese army, starting from Zengcheng, advanced along the Dongjiang North Road, entering locations such as Mazha, Liang Kouxu, and Niubeiji in Longmen County. This area is a region of rugged mountains. Since the Republic of China, there have been internal wars one after another, and no military strategists dared to pass through this road. The Japanese army actually advanced from here, which shows how risky their venture was. This route of the Japanese army, with over 18,000 men, was originally an elite unit stationed in northern Manchuria to defend against the Soviets. Last winter, they were ordered to return to China. The soldiers thought they could leave military service and enjoy family reunions, but unexpectedly, before they could rest, they were transferred to Guangzhou. Their morale declined, and they had no desire to fight. Therefore, despite being an elite unit, they were ultimately cut off and crushed by the Chinese forces of Peng Linsheng and Zhao Yijian. As for the Chinese forces, after arriving in Wengyuan and Xinfeng, they cleared the remnants of the Japanese army in Jinzhuyuan, Shatian, Meikeng, Huameitang, and other places south of Qingtang. They continued to sweep south and surrounded over a thousand Japanese soldiers who had entrenched themselves in the mountainous area around Gutian Daping, south of Lyutianxu, and fought fiercely overnight. The Japanese army suffered more than half casualties, and corpses were scattered everywhere. Gutian Daping was subsequently recovered, and a large number of military supplies were captured. The survivors retreated to the area of Jilonggang, Guancun, and Shikeng northeast of Conghua. On the morning of the 8th, Zhao's division and the Liu Jingwu regiment of Lin Weichou's division, who were stationed at Ludongdong on the border between Zengcheng and Longmen, joined forces to attack Jilonggang and Shikeng. The Japanese army's Yado Brigade fought Zhao and Lin's divisions for four hours, then collapsed towards Guancun, Fengyuan, Hélùjing, and Shengang. Some fled back to the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway. Most of the Chinese forces stationed at Niubeiji and Liang Kouxu attacked Conghua City along the Xincóng Road on the 8th and recovered Conghua City on the morning of the 11th. The remaining Japanese forces retreated towards Guangzhou.</p>
<p>The Japanese army's defeat in this battle was most disastrous in several battles within Wengyuan, including Wuguandu, Sanhua, Meikeng, and Xinfeng. Because the mountains are high and the forests are dense in each of these places, Japanese aircraft could not assist in combat. Japanese tanks and heavy ordnance could not exert their power. The ravines between the valleys were crisscrossed. Japanese armored vehicles, tanks, cavalry, etc., were completely useless. As a result, the Chinese forces captured 270 tanks that had been destroyed. At the beginning of the Japanese army's northward advance, they forcibly conscripted laborers and grooms in Guangzhou. Those who were conscripted hated them to the bone. Therefore, above Meikeng, they scattered and fled into the mountains. The Japanese mules and horses were unattended. They ran around in the artillery fire, and in less than half a day, they scattered. They left behind mountain guns, baggage, and provisions, piled up in the trails, causing the Chinese forces and civilians to have to detour. The Chinese forces and civilians captured 2,600 mules and horses. It is reported that they were produced in Northeast China. The number of mountain guns and field guns was considerable, filling the road, so that the Chinese forces and civilians had to detour.</p>
<p>When the Chinese forces recovered Wengyuan and Sanhua, the Japanese army, because the retreat route in Meikeng had been cut off, dispersed towards Fogang County. The Chinese forces advancing southward along the west bank of the Yingde North River reached south of Hengshi on the 5th and attacked Qingyuan City in three routes. On the 11th, the Japanese forces were attacked by the Zhang and Wang divisions and entered the city, resulting in fierce street fighting. The Japanese army then collapsed southward, and the Chinese forces recovered Qingyuan City and divided into two routes to cross the North River. One route went straight to Xinjie on the Yuehan Road along Longtang and Yinzhan, and the other route went out of Shijiao and Guotai and ambushed in Chiní and Bainí, and they are now surrounded and annihilated. Between Yinzhan'ao and Shijiao, there are 3,000 remnants of the Japanese army, surrounded by Chinese forces. The Japanese army that fled from Lyutian to Pingtan was completely annihilated. The more than 1,000 Japanese troops retreating south from Yingde along the Yuehan Railway collapsed into the mountains. With the help of the local militia, the Chinese forces tracked them down. On the evening of the 7th, the Chinese forces captured Fogang County.</p>
<p>It is said that the Japanese army that invaded the north in this battle was the 18th Division, the 104th Division, the 108th Division, and the Konoe Mixed Brigade, totaling 100,000 men. The 55th Regiment of the 18th Division was annihilated in the narrowness of Meikeng and Jinzhuyuan. The 104th Division and the 108th Division were cut into several sections in Yinzhan'ao, Yuantan, Lianjiangkou, and Pajiangkou, and corpses were left behind in Guandu, Sanhua, Qingtang, Dazhen, Shilong, Shatian, Meikeng, Lyutian, Zuotan, Liang Kouxu, Hetou, Yingde, and Lianjiangkou, filling the mountains and valleys. The Chinese forces buried more than 3,000 corpses of the Japanese army on behalf of them. Six thousand Japanese officers, including Oada Aqing, erected wooden plaques as a record. The 12th Army Corps captured two artillery pieces, 170 light and heavy machine guns, and more than 4,000 rifles. Other units captured countless military supplies, which have not yet been fully calculated. According to military experts, the value is at least more than 30 million Hong Kong dollars. Just in terms of military radio transceivers, there are as many as 70 units. Others can be imagined.</p>
<h3>Japanese Forces in Wuxi Threaten the People, City Gates Not Fully Opened, Women and Children Allowed to Pass</h3>
<p>Wuxi Correspondence: After the puppet governor Yang Shoutong was shot and killed, the Japanese side made a big fuss. The city gates were tightly closed, and traffic was cut off for a week. After several days of searching the city, many innocent people were arrested by the Japanese army as murderers. The people inside and outside the city, because their food supply had been cut off, were given porridge by the Red Swastika Society at 1:00 or 2:00 p.m. every day to fill their stomachs, and this had to be approved by the Japanese side. From the 15th, the Japanese army allowed Guangfu Gate and South Gate to open, but only for women and children under the age of twelve, and they must have a pass. The time for passage is from 8:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. Men are generally not allowed to pass. From the 16th, traffic outside the city was allowed from Wuqiao, Aolongqiao, Yinglongqiao, Qingmingqiao, Xinglongqiao, Tingziqiao, Shirenqiao, and Tangnanqiao. The day before yesterday, the Japanese army learned that Yang Shoutong was killed at the entrance of a foreign goods store in Sixiangkou. At that time, all the staff in the store were tied up with ropes and stabbed with bayonets. Everyone was seriously injured and is now being treated at Puren Hospital. The goods in the store were also completely destroyed. Teahouses, hotels, and hostels inside and outside the city have not been allowed to resume business. Travelers from Shanghai who take the train to Wuxi, if they arrive in Wuxi after the passing time, have no way to deal with it, and most return to Shanghai or Suzhou. Water and land transportation have not been restored to their original state. The people of Wuxi, after this threat, are full of complaints and do not want to stay in the city. There are quite a few who have fled to the countryside.</p>
<h3>Fujian Province Deploys Guerrilla Warfare, Coastal Counties Have Been Fully Prepared</h3>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: The Fujian Provincial Authorities are aware that the coastal counties are under the threat of Japanese military force and are likely to be attacked at any time. To facilitate flexible operations in the future, so that the military and civilians do not lose contact and local administration is not affected, a special order was issued to all counties to build guerrilla bases in the rear, construct strong fortifications, and store rice, medicine, and daily necessities for future needs. After receiving the order, the counties, after some time of effort, have completed the deployment according to the planned plan. The supplies are fully prepared, and the entire project has reached perfection. The construction is carried out by utilizing the terrain behind a certain number of miles from the coastline, and the engineering is extremely ingenious. The governments of the coastal counties of Dongshan, Zhaoan, Tongan, Haicheng, Jinjiang, and Fuqing have all moved to safe areas for the convenience of peacetime administration and wartime command. The city walls and bunkers in important cities such as Fuzhou and Quanzhou, which had previously been partially destroyed, are now being torn down completely to avoid hindering future guerrilla warfare. The empty houses in Quanzhou are also being demolished to avoid hiding traitors. Residents in coastal villages in Tongan and Hui'an are being ordered by the government to move to designated locations to avoid being shelled by Japanese warships or bombed by Japanese aircraft at any time. Unemployed people in the coastal counties are being transported by the Provincial Relief Association to the interior of northwestern Fujian for reclamation or to work in factories.</p>

<h3>The Republic of China, Year 28: A Review of Chinese Education (3)</h3>
<p>— Chen Lijiang</p>
<p>(III) General Education</p>
<p>General education, including secondary and primary education, has also seen considerable creation and advancement in terms of principles. (1) "Division of School Districts": The distribution of schools in various regions used to be very uneven, but recently, the measure of dividing school districts has been adopted to correct this deficiency. Provincial education departments have divided the entire province into several middle school districts, so that middle schools within the district are appropriately allocated and can develop evenly. Currently, Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, Guangxi, Ningxia, and Qinghai provinces have all implemented this. (2) "Revision of Curriculum Standards": There is a significant need for improvement in the subjects and hours of senior and junior high schools. Regarding these courses, the Ministry of Education is currently gathering opinions from various parties and is working on sorting and revising them. Furthermore, in the past, there were no standards for running kindergartens, but now the Kindergarten Regulations have been formulated and promulgated. (3) "Holding of Summer Workshops": Continuing training and further education for middle school teachers is very important. This summer, Sichuan, Guizhou, Yunnan, Shaanxi, and Gansu provinces have all separately convened middle school teachers to conduct lectures and discussions to provide training. In the field of vocational education, the Ministry of Education has also designated National Central University and other schools to separately run summer workshops on agricultural and industrial education in Shaanxi, Gansu, Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, and Kangding provinces, so that teachers of all subjects can have opportunities for further study. (4) "Training of Education Administrative Officials": The central government has provided few training opportunities for education administrative personnel in various provinces, such as senior officials of education departments and principals of middle schools and section chiefs of county education bureaus. However, this year, the fourth session of the Party and Government Training Class of the Central Training Corps specially gathered 500 education administrative personnel from Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, and Hubei provinces to provide training. For example, the Ministry of Education convened a meeting of middle school principals in Sichuan Province to discuss re-election, etc., which has greatly influenced administrative improvement. (5) "Improvement and Supplementation of Textbooks for Primary and Secondary Schools": Most textbooks were compiled before the war and lacked materials on the War of Resistance, nation-building, and the General Mobilization of National Spirit. However, now the Ministry of Education has compiled supplementary wartime teaching materials for various subjects to remedy this. At the same time, it is also compiling various suitable textbooks for primary and secondary schools and vocational schools for use by various schools. (6) "Addition and Reform of National Middle Schools": This year, three national middle schools have been added, and more than 5,000 students who lost their schooling in the war zone have been admitted. Regarding the division of branch schools, the management of students, the rectification of academic atmosphere, and the assessment of the responsibilities and treatment of teachers and the examination of teaching performance, on the one hand, rectification methods have been formulated and implemented, and on the other hand, principals' meetings have been held to discuss the solution of various practical problems, resulting in considerable improvement. (7) "Promotion of Normal Education": Various provinces still lack overall planning for normal education, but under the guidance of the Ministry of Education, Guizhou, Yunnan, Jiangxi, Guangdong, Guangxi, Hunan, Hubei, Sichuan, Gansu, Kangding, Ningxia, and Qinghai provinces have now formulated and implemented overall implementation plans. The Ministry of Education has also stipulated the implementation of measures for normal schools to guide local education, making normal schools the guidance center for primary school teachers. (8) "Promotion of Vocational Education": Vocational schools have also expanded considerably this year.

Classes are held in Shanghai. It has gone through two summers and winters, and has achieved remarkable results, earning the trust of society. Since it was registered by the Jiangsu Department of Education last year, it has been actively improving and sparing no effort.

<h3>Settlement of the Extraterritorial Road Construction Negotiation; Police Issues to be Compromised; A New Police Organization to be Formed Jointly by Both Sides; The Outstanding Case of Collecting Donations Will Also be Resolved Successively</h3>
<p>Negotiations between the Public Concession's Municipal Council and the puppet city government regarding the issue of extraterritorial road construction are currently being discussed by General Manager Philippe and Fu Xiao'an to form a new policy organization to manage the administration of the extraterritorial road construction area. This new organization could be established by the end of February. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Negotiations Between Both Sides Reportedly to be Resolved</p>
<p>According to the Continental News, yesterday (the 18th), General Manager and Director Philippe of the Municipal Council and "Mayor of Shanghai" Fu Xiao'an were engaged in negotiations. If no unforeseen serious obstacles occur, a new police organization will take over the extraterritorial road construction area of the city before the end of February. The organization of this agency and the management of this police force have been drafted. Although not formally accepted by either party, it is reported to have been approved by the Municipal Council and the "Shanghai Municipal Government."</p>
<p>Police Organization Jointly Formed by Both Sides</p>
<p>The agency will be named the "Extraterritorial Road Construction Police Bureau" and will be jointly managed by the Municipal Council's Police Department and the "Shanghai Municipal Government." The entire extraterritorial road construction area, which has been in dispute for more than a year, will be under the jurisdiction of this new agency. If the police aspect is properly negotiated, one of the two outstanding cases regarding the extremely important extraterritorial road construction issue encountered by the Municipal Council will be resolved.</p>
<p>The Issue of Collecting Donations Can Also be Compromised</p>
<p>The two parties also began discussing another outstanding case in the area of collecting donations some time ago in order to obtain a resolution. It is reported that the two parties will reach an agreement on this issue immediately after the police reconciliation.</p>
<p>Puppet Government Appoints Personnel to Serve as Police Chief</p>
<p>According to news obtained yesterday, the Extraterritorial Road Construction Police Bureau will be headed by a police chief selected by the "Shanghai Municipal Government," and the deputy police chief will be appointed by the Municipal Council. In addition, the headquarters staff will consist of 40 people, with each party sending half. Their names must be exchanged with each other before final appointment, and both the Municipal Council and the "Shanghai Municipal Government" reserve the right to reject any person sent by the other party.</p>
<p>Several Details Have Not Yet Been Agreed Upon</p>
<p>Although the above organization has been approved by both parties, several details have not yet been agreed upon. It is reported that the Municipal Council is now requesting that the new agency be given full power, and the Police Department also feels that once this new police force is in charge of the area, it cannot allow various sinful places in the area to continue to operate.</p>
<p>All Evil in Bad Territories Must be Eradicated</p>
<p>It is a recognized fact that the extraterritorial road construction area is a concentration of gambling dens and drug trafficking activities. Licensed Tu Hangs continue to exist and operate prosperously, and gambling dens are constantly increasing. Since these activities are strictly prohibited and punished by law within the Public Concession, the Municipal Council cannot tolerate its police force, which is jointly managed by senior police officers, allowing these activities to exist.</p>
<h3>Industrial and Commercial Circles Should Stand Firm, Work Hard to Produce; The Ministry Clearly Explains the Truth About Restrictions on Domestic Sales in a Telegram to Shanghai</h3>
<p>The Shanghai National Products Manufacturers Association sent a telegram to inquire about the truth about the restrictions on the domestic transportation of national products. It received a telegram from the Ministry of Economic Affairs stating that there is absolutely no discrimination against industrial and commercial enterprises in Shanghai that have not been seized and utilized by the enemy, and hoping that they will not be confused by rumors. The Shanghai industrial and commercial circles were very pleased to hear this news. The Shanghai National Products Manufacturers Association has sent the original telegram from the Ministry of Economic Affairs to its member manufacturers for information, and encouraged them to stand firm during this extraordinary period, work hard in wartime production, and live up to the expectations of the authorities.</p>
<p>According to a letter from Zhanghua Woolen Textile Company, "The report on the 18th of this month stated that goods were not allowed to be imported into Ningbo, which was a list announced by the Navigation Department. The products of our company are also on the list of prohibited items. We were very surprised to read this. Our company's Shanghai Special Zone New Factory products have been presented to the Ministry of Economic Affairs for the issuance of National Goods Certificates No. 156 and 157, and have been approved for transportation and sale in the mainland. We believe that the Department was not aware of the details, resulting in a misunderstanding. We are deeply concerned that the outside world does not know the truth and ask you to publish this so as not to cause confusion."</p>
<h3>The American Ambassador Will Contact Diplomatic Circles in Shanghai; Met with Kato and Colonel Baker Yesterday; Claimed that Trip to Hankou Was Only a Tour</h3>
<p>American Ambassador to China Johnson arrived in Shanghai by ship on the morning of the 18th and was extremely busy all day. In addition to meeting with Consul General Gauss at the Cathay Hotel at 10:00 a.m., he also received Japanese Envoy Kato at the Ambassador's office at 11:00 a.m. for about 20 minutes of talks. The Ambassador also met with the newly appointed Commander of the Fourth Marine Regiment in Shanghai, Colonel Baker, in the afternoon.</p>
<p>To Hankou on Monday</p>
<p>The Ambassador will spend the weekend in Shanghai and is scheduled to travel west on the American ship Luzon on the 22nd with Rear Admiral Glassford, Commander of the American Yangtze River Patrol, to inspect the overseas Chinese affairs in Nanjing, Wuhu, Jiujiang and other places, and then meet with the American Consul General in Hankou to listen to a report on the current situation. The American ship Wohu will accompany the Ambassador to Hankou at that time to provide protection, replacing the position of the Guam, which has left Hankou. The Ambassador is scheduled to return here on February 6.</p>
<p>Diplomatic Activities</p>
<p>During his stay in Shanghai, the Ambassador will have diplomatic activities and make routine contacts with diplomatic circles in various countries, and then wait for a ship to Hong Kong to fly to Chongqing to meet with the British and French Ambassadors to deal with official business. According to the Ambassador, his trip to Shanghai, and then to Hankou next week and back to Chongqing, has no special significance, and is only routine official business. He did not want to make any comments on political issues.</p>
<p>Concern for American Merchants</p>
<p>This trip of the Ambassador to Hankou is still the first among the ambassadors of various countries after the Japanese army occupied the Yangtze River. Although the Ambassador stated that he and Rear Admiral Glassford were traveling to Hankou by ship for routine inspection and did not contain any special meaning, and had no mutual relationship with the Japanese side's opening of the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, it is generally believed that the Ambassador's sudden trip to the Yangtze River must be for the purpose of studying the current situation of American overseas Chinese, the trend after the opening, and the American trade issues in the Yangtze River, and to obtain a reference, and will decide on the issue of the Japanese side's willingness to consider the export of more than a thousand tons of diesel oil for American merchants in the Yangtze River.</p>
<h3>Zhang Yunhe, Deputy Editor-in-Chief of this Newspaper, Cremated Yesterday; Numerous Mourners, Extremely Honored</h3>
<p>The news of the death of Mr. Zhang Yunhe, Deputy Editor-in-Chief of this newspaper, has been detailed in previous reports. Yesterday was the day of Mr. Zhang's cremation. The scene at the time is described as follows:</p>
<p>Arrangement of the Funeral Hall</p>
<p>Above the auditorium was a half-length portrait of Mr. Zhang, slightly to the right, lifelike. The wreaths given by various sectors surrounded the right side of the shock. Before the seat were sacrificial dishes, white candles burned high, and incense swirled. A mourning couplet was hung next to it, mourned by Mr. Shen Enfu. The upper line said, "Holding the pen for nearly forty years, regretting the difficulties of the times, sick for a long time and seeing the return of the homeland," and the lower line said, "Three years away from rare age, sadly recalling friendship, unwilling to talk about life in old age." The colleagues of this newspaper said in a couplet, "Clear demeanor and bright integrity, the object of public admiration, forty years of dedication and labor, there should be sincerity to rely on future generations, and the colleagues of the editorial department said in a couplet, "Remembering the thirty years of fame on the forum, long admiring the pure fragrance, and thinking that Da Die was in front, Mr. Duan should enjoy the blessing, mourning the recent four or five years, raising illness in the house, and still bearing the teaching, how can we expect Xiu Wen to go to the summons, and the colleagues all sadly lost their mentor."</p>
<p>Removal of the Coffin After Cremation</p>
<p>In the afternoon, mourners from all sides came in an endless stream, such as Chen Taoyi, Tang Dingzhi, Min Ruizhi, Wang Boqi, Yan Duhe, etc., more than a hundred people. All the colleagues of this newspaper went to hold the coffin, and representatives from the Commercial Press, the Newspaper Industry Union, and the Newspaper Workers School all went. The coffin was sealed at two o'clock, dressed in a blue robe and black gown. After the coffin was sealed, the guests paid their respects, and then the coffin was moved to the Wan'an coffin storage place on Haige Road Yidingpan Road. After holding a public memorial ceremony, the guests dispersed.</p>
<h3>Muslim Eid al-Adha Festival Today; Citywide Celebrations; Muslim Classics; Assemble on Time</h3>
<p>Today is the Muslim festival of sacrifice, Eid al-Adha. All Muslims who are able must go to Mecca to make a pilgrimage to the Kaaba, which is an essential part of a Muslim's life. Those who are not able can go to the local mosque to participate in the Eid al-Adha prayers. Therefore, this morning, one-eighth of the world's population will commemorate the sacrificial spirit of the Prophet Abraham and his son Ishmael, and will make a great prayer under the training of firm faith, fully expressing their unity and courage. The mosques in the city are scheduled to hold Eid al-Adha prayers at 9:00 a.m. today, so Muslims in the city will gather at the mosques on time, which will be a grand occasion.</p>
<h3>Japanese Bombing of the Huangpu River and Blocking of Money; Retreating When Knowing it is Difficult; Failure to Succeed After Two Years of Raising Time; Technical Guards Have Returned to Tokyo</h3>
<p>There are more than a dozen large iron-hulled ships among the underwater obstacles left by the Chinese army blocking money in the 16th shop. It has taken the Japanese two years, and there are still six or seven large ships. Because there is too much mud in the hulls, not only is it difficult to salvage, but even if they are all bombed, it is impossible to place a large amount of explosives because there are so many ships entering and leaving the area. Therefore, the technical specialists commissioned by the Japanese side all feel that they are technically exhausted and helpless, and have returned to Tokyo early. It has been rumored that when the tide in the Huangpu River is small in winter, they will come to China again to completely destroy the underwater obstacles in order to restore the navigation of the southern Huangpu River and allow large ships to enter and leave both sides of the South Huangpu River. However, in the blink of an eye, winter is coming to an end and spring is coming. There has been no movement in the Huangpu River in recent days, which proves that the Japanese side has retreated when knowing that this huge project is difficult.</p>
<h3>Flat Price Rice Sales to Begin Tomorrow; Authorities to Ensure Order; Continued Fundraising for Flat Price Rice Sales Aims for Sustainability; Procurement Committee Approves Continued Ordering of Tribute Rice; Location for Receiving Flat Price Rice Must Match the Rice Ticket Number</h3>
<p>The Commissioner of Police of the Public Concession issued a notice on the 18th of this month, stating: The Shanghai Flat Price Rice Committee, in view of the high rice prices, has purchased a batch of Saigon broken rice and established flat price rice distribution points in the Public Concession and the French Concession, entrusting various rice shops to handle ticket sales and rice distribution. This flat price rice sale is purely a charitable endeavor, intended to benefit the people's livelihood. All rice purchasers must understand this intention, strictly maintain order, and not cause trouble. Any unruly individuals who cause disturbances at the rice shops will be immediately arrested and severely punished. This notice is hereby issued.</p>
<p>Flat Price Sale Dates: From January 21st, daily from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM</p>
<p>Limit on Rice Purchase: Six and a half catties (market catties) per yuan; each person limited to one yuan.</p>
<p>Flat Price Foreign Rice: Arriving in batches</p>
<p>The Flat Price Rice Committee entrusted the British firm Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. to order 1,500 tons of broken Saigon rice, which has been shipped to Shanghai in three batches. The first batch of 300 tons, loaded on the French postal ship "Felix Roussel," arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning and docked at the Shuntai Wharf in Hongkou. The second batch of 300 tons, loaded on the Italian postal ship "Fusiyama," is expected to arrive in Shanghai on the 21st. The third batch of 900 tons, loaded on the Italian postal ship "Sammartula," is expected to arrive around the 25th. As for the 20,068 bags of Saigon broken rice purchased from the Shanghai market, the payment has been cleared and delivery has begun. Starting today, they will be distributed to the various flat price rice shops to handle the flat price sales. All flat price procedures, such as rice tickets, account books, and new dippers, have been completed by the Flat Price Committee and are approved for sale starting on the 21st (Sunday). It is stipulated that there are a total of 50 locations in the two concessions. Rice tickets purchased at the first location are only allowed to be redeemed at the designated rice shop for the first location. Each location will sell 50 bags of rice per day, until they are sold out. Calculated at six and a half catties per yuan, the average selling price is approximately 25 yuan in national currency per picul of 160 catties.</p>
<p>Actively Raising Funds: Sustainable Operation</p>
<p>In order to operate the flat price rice sales sustainably, the Flat Price Rice Committee is actively soliciting flat price donations from various industries. The confirmed donations from various industries are 500,000 yuan for the first round and 62,000 yuan for the second round. Fundraising is currently continuing in various industries, and it is hoped that all sectors will voluntarily donate, striving to reach the goal of one million yuan. The receiving agencies are the Zhongnan Bank, Jin Cheng Bank, Shanghai Bank, and the Tongrun Qianzhuang, Zifeng Qianzhuang. In addition, Zhao Fuji personally volunteered to donate 5,000 yuan, which has been sent to Jin Cheng Bank for collection. His enthusiasm for flat price rice sales is truly admirable. Furthermore, Huang Yuzhai donated 500 yuan, which was mistakenly printed as 50 yuan yesterday.</p>
<p>Second Batch of Ordered Rice: Approved</p>
<p>The People's Food Regulation Association held its fourth executive committee meeting yesterday afternoon. Chairman Yu Qiaqing reported on the following matters: ① The treasurer reported that the Jin Cheng Bank escrow account had received over 290,000 yuan in deposit from households who entrusted the association to order foreign rice, totaling over 14,000 bags. In addition to the 6,000 bags already ordered, another 8,000 bags need to be ordered. ② The secretary reported that the Purchasing Committee is planning to order another batch of No. 2 Saigon rice on the 22nd of this month based on the application amounts from various households, which has been approved by the executive committee members. Matters for discussion: ① The warehousing insurance fees and interest for the first 6,000 bags of foreign rice ordered on behalf of the households will be cleared by the treasurer, and then a letter will be sent to each ordering household to prepare funds for delivery. Apart from the aforementioned necessary expenses, the association will not charge any additional fees. ② The second batch of foreign rice will be ordered on the 22nd of this month. The quantity will be based on the application amounts as of the 21st of this month, and the Purchasing Committee will handle the procurement. The delivery must be made to warehouses in the safe zone of the British and French Concessions. The chairman and treasurer will jointly sign the order on behalf of the association. ③ Some households have entrusted the association to order broken rice, but the quantity is small and it is inconvenient to place a separate order. It is proposed to notify these households to withdraw their deposits. The association will temporarily not order broken rice on behalf of households, but will only order No. 2 Saigon rice. ④ For public associations that have pledged funds to the association, it should be verified with the Flat Price Rice Committee whether all or part of the funds have been transferred to flat price rice donations. The remaining amount should still be requested from the public associations. ⑤ Additional appointments: Yan Fang and Guo Shun were appointed as members of the association's Purchasing Committee. ⑥ Cao Xinxi sent a letter resigning from the association's Purchasing Committee, and it was decided to send a letter earnestly requesting him to stay.</p>
<h3>Assault on American Woman: Official Japanese Apology; U.S. Consulate Deems Unsatisfactory; No Decision on Further Action</h3>
<p>According to the English "China Press," regarding the assault on American citizen Miss Donaldson by a Japanese sentry, the U.S. Consul General has received an apology from the Japanese side but deems it unsatisfactory. Yesterday (the 18th), when Miss Donaldson went to the U.S. Consulate, two Japanese naval officers wearing medals and carrying swords verbally apologized to Miss Donaldson. Miss Donaldson, as instructed by consulate officials, was not allowed to speak to reporters. According to Mr. Porter of the U.S. Consulate, "All I am prepared to say is that the U.S. Consulate has received a letter from the Japanese Consulate General regarding this case." When asked if the matter had been resolved, Mr. Porter replied that no decision had been made regarding further action. A Japanese spokesperson, in speaking to reporters, had twice flatly denied Miss Donaldson's claim that she was assaulted by a Japanese sentry on the Sichuan Road Bridge. However, the Japanese naval officers stated during yesterday's apology that, in order to prevent such incidents from recurring in the future, English notices would be posted on the bridges over the Suzhou Creek, advising pedestrians to keep to the left. It is reported that Miss Donaldson is a buyer for an American department store, has an office in the Hamilton House, and also resides there. Furthermore, according to the "Shanghai Times," the Japanese Consulate General issued a statement last night saying, "U.S. Acting Consul General Lockhart sent a letter to Japanese Consul General Miura on December 28 regarding the Donaldson case. On December 30, Miura requested U.S. Consul General Gauss to provide detailed reports necessary for a thorough investigation, and received a reply on January 4. The Japanese authorities then conducted a detailed investigation, the results of which have been communicated by Miura to the U.S. Consul General today. It is believed that this matter will be resolved by the explanations in the letter."</p>
<h3>Commercial Press: Employee Subsidies Resolved; Representatives Return to Shanghai from Hong Kong</h3>
<p>All employees of the Commercial Press, due to soaring prices, had previously submitted a request to the company through the union for subsidies and other demands. Representatives were dispatched in response to a telegram from General Manager Wang in Hong Kong. The representatives have now returned to Shanghai. It is reported that after several frank negotiations, both labor and management have decided to share the difficulties, and the matter has been resolved.</p>

<h3>Japanese Forcibly Seizing Inland Wheat: Flour Mills Struggle to Operate; Closure Feared After Inventory Depleted; Australian and American Wheat Prices Soar</h3>
<p>According to the "Continental Daily," a Chinese flour mill owner told a reporter yesterday (the 18th) that no wheat is being transported from inland areas, and since the outbreak of the European war, the prices of Australian and American wheat have soared, putting local flour mills in a critical situation. Only a quarter of the machines are working, and closure is feared after the inventory is depleted. The mill owner did not explicitly state why no wheat is being transported, but rumors of Japanese people doing their utmost to forcibly seize wheat have been confirmed. The mill owner continued, saying that Shanghai has enough wheat to last about five months. If the situation does not change by then, the flour mills will be unable to continue operating. The high prices of Australian and American wheat are due to the low exchange rate and high freight costs. The poor harvest in the United States may cause the price of American wheat to rise from the current one U.S. dollar per bushel to three dollars. However, it is reported that 20,000 tons of Australian wheat have already been shipped to Shanghai this month, and more purchases will be made soon. Most of China's imported wheat comes from Australia. Normally, Shanghai factories start purchasing Australian wheat around October when the domestic wheat supply runs low. However, this year, due to the low exchange rate, purchases started as early as January.</p>
<p>In 1938, local flour mills gradually recovered after the war, making every effort to clear their inventory. The amount of foreign wheat imported into China that year was only 1,700 kilograms. However, last year, due to the lack of domestic wheat, foreign wheat was purchased. As a result, customs figures show that 467,083,500 kilograms of foreign wheat were imported, of which 296,721,400 kilograms came from Australia. In the first half of last year, 70% of the wheat imported into China came from Australia.</p>
<h3>Wusong: Bomb Explosion Kills Three Road Workers; Two Others Seriously Injured</h3>
<p>Japanese troops stationed at Zhanghuabang in Wusong have recently been building roads in the area, starting from Zhanghuabang, passing west of Haoqiaobin, north to Zhoujiaqiao, turning west along Yunzaobin, passing Jijiabin, and reaching Luodian and Nanxiang. Residents of Haoqiaozhai on the west side of Haoqiao and Xiaoxujia Lane and Zhoujiabangzhai north of Haoqiao have been evicted by the Hengchan Company. The land is priced at 40 yuan per square meter, and the houses are valued at the discretion of the Hengchan Company. Residents are powerless to resist, although they are angry but dare not speak out. A few days ago, five road workers, all from out of town, were working on the west side of Haoqiao. Because of the cold weather, they moved some burnt coke and dug a hole to burn it for warmth. As the five workers were huddled around the fire, a bomb hidden in the soil was detonated by the heat. A loud explosion occurred, killing three workers on the spot. Another worker suffered serious injuries to his shoulders, chest, and abdomen, and his life is in danger. The remaining worker suffered an injury to his right foot, which may result in permanent disability, but his life may be saved.</p>
<h3>Yangtze River Water Level Plummets: Japanese Vessels Stop at Wuhu; Small Boats Used for Transportation Between Wuhu and Huangshigang; Additional Barges Required from Huangshigang to Hankou</h3>
<p>The water level of the Yangtze River inevitably decreases every winter, making it difficult for river vessels to navigate. Since the withdrawal of the National Army to the west, the entire Yangtze River line below Hankou has been controlled by the Japanese Navy, and foreign vessels have been excluded from shipping, with Japanese vessels exclusively enjoying the benefits. According to shipping news, the Yangtze River water level has sharply decreased this winter, especially in the Huangshigang section, where the water depth is only six feet. Vessels of the East Asia Shipping Company (formerly the Japanese Qing Company) can no longer reach Hankou, with larger vessels stopping at Wuhu. Small river vessels previously operating on the Sichuan-Hunan route, such as the Yunyang Maru, Dangyang Maru, Yiyang Maru, and Shallow Water, are being used to transport cargo between Wuhu and Huangshigang. However, from Huangshigang to Hankou, additional barges are required for transshipment, with small tugboats towing them to Hankou. Based on the above situation, the shallow depth of the Yangtze River this winter is evident.</p>
<h3>Wusong Estuary: Rampant Pirates; Fish Vendors Carrying Full Loads; Pirates Covet</h3>
<p>The sea off the Wusong estuary has recently seen frequent pirate activity, with robberies and looting occurring from time to time. On the 10th of this month, a fish boat named "Shi Yuanxing" from Shenjiamen, Dinghai, manned by Zhang Xiaogen and his son Zhang Mingbiao, set off from Shenjiamen to Songshan to purchase iced hairtail for transport to Shanghai for sale at the "Fish Market." The next day, while loaded with cigarettes, matches, and goods from the north and south, it was returning to Shenjiamen when it encountered a pirate ship off the Yushan waters of Wusong and was robbed. On the morning of the 14th, another transport ship from Shenjiamen encountered robbers in the Tongsha waters and suffered losses of over 4,000 yuan. Furthermore, as the hairtail season is coming to an end, fishing boats are carrying New Year's goods back to their hometowns, making them targets for pirates. Recently, pirates have also been rampant in the Putuo waters, Huangdayang, and Shengsi waters.</p>
<h3>American Rescue Ship: Sails to Manila; Encountered Typhoon in Qingdao Last Year; Undergoing Minor Repairs in Shanghai Shipyard</h3>
<p>According to the "Continental Daily," the U.S. submarine rescue ship "Pigeon," which ran aground in Qingdao during a typhoon in early September last year, is still undergoing repairs at the Woofung Machinery Factory shipyard in Shanghai and is scheduled to sail to Manila early next week. It is reported that the "Pigeon" underwent temporary repairs in Qingdao after running aground, and was subsequently towed to Shanghai by the U.S. destroyer "Widgeon." It entered the shipyard on November 14 of last year for repairs to its hull and engine, costing 500 yuan. After arriving in Manila in early February, it may enter a government-managed shipyard for final repairs.</p>

<h3>Zhenhai Port: Japanese Ships Withdrawn</h3>
<p>The four Japanese ships outside Zhenhai Port, off Liaobiaozui, sailed away last night. However, the Zhenhai Fortress defense forces remain on high alert. Order in Ningbo is as usual. Residents of Longshan, Xiepu, and Guanhaiwei in Cibei, where shells fell, are calm and orderly, and they have evacuated as ordered to avoid unnecessary sacrifices.</p>
<h3>Loyal Righteous Army Undergoing Reorganization: Strength Increasing; Puppet Troops in Nanshi Disarmed; Remaining Puppet Troops Panicked</h3>
<p>The Loyal Righteous National Salvation Army in the suburbs of Shanghai, after He Xingjian's betrayal and death, has been reorganized by central government officials, and commanders of various brigades with pure intentions have been promoted. Currently, in the suburbs of Shanghai, such as Pudong, western Shanghai, Baoshan, and Songjiang, there are configurations of "X" detachments. Each detachment has three brigades, its strength equivalent to the momentum of ten regular army regiments. During the recent winter offensive, these troops have advanced on all sides. The troops of various buffer forces such as Ding, Fan, and Xu have defected upon hearing the news, and Ding, Fan, and Xu themselves have hidden and dare not return to their defense positions. It is reported that the puppet "Peace National Salvation Army" has also changed its name to the puppet "Peace National Construction Army." However, generally, bandits in Pudong who adopted this name were ordered to move to Nanshi. Upon arriving in Nanshi, they were all disarmed and disbanded by the Japanese forces.</p>
<h3>Siberian High Pressure: Minimal Impact on Shanghai; Advancing Southeast to Invade the Eastern Four Provinces; Shanghai Sky Overcast, No Sign of Snow</h3>
<p>Yesterday's weather in Shanghai was slightly affected by the Siberian high pressure, becoming relatively colder. The climate will continue to turn colder today and tomorrow. The Datong News Agency reporter provides the following details:</p>
<p>High Pressure Moving Southeast</p>
<p>According to the Xujiahui Observatory, a high-pressure system has formed in Siberia, causing a sharp drop in temperature to minus 47 degrees Celsius. The climate in Vladivostok is also only minus 19 degrees Celsius. Although the climate in Tianjin and Beijing is also slightly affected by the Siberian high pressure, the minimum temperature is around minus 7 degrees Celsius.</p>
<p>Shanghai Not Directly Affected</p>
<p>Because the Siberian high pressure is currently moving southeast and not south-southeast, the area affected will be the Eastern Four Provinces. Shanghai can avoid being affected. Although the temperature seemed slightly lower yesterday, the minimum was still 3.1 degrees Celsius (37.6 degrees Fahrenheit), and the maximum was 7.2 degrees Celsius (45 degrees Fahrenheit). Therefore, the impact is minimal.</p>
<p>Difficult to Predict Snowy Weather</p>
<p>According to the observatory's prediction, the weather in Shanghai will continue to turn colder today and tomorrow, but it will not reach an extremely cold level. Although the sky was overcast yesterday, giving the impression that snow was brewing, the weather reports from all over the country show no snowfall. Therefore, it is inferred that Shanghai is unlikely to see falling snow. If so, the fields will see an increase in pests, which will affect the spring planting and be detrimental to health.</p>
<h3>Wan Yu Sauce Garden: Manager Embezzles Funds; Sentenced to One Year and Two Months in Prison</h3>
<p>Pu Qudan (50 years old), from Jiading, was the manager of Wan Yu Sauce Garden at No. 190 Marlang Road in the French Concession. Recently, he was discovered by the owner, Shen Shuyi, to have embezzled over 10,000 yuan from the store's accounts. On December 24 of last year, Shen reported the crime to the French police, who dispatched detectives to arrest Pu. At the time of his arrest, Pu was caught smoking opium in bed. The detectives brought the smoking paraphernalia to the police station and sent it to the Second Special Court for detention and interrogation. Details have been reported in previous newspapers. The case was continued yesterday by Judge Sun Pengxian of the Criminal Division of the court. The police attorney, Gu Shouxi, stated that the plaintiff had commissioned an accountant to investigate, and the result showed that the total amount embezzled was 29,880 yuan. Furthermore, the defendant was also guilty of opium addiction, so he was prosecuted for embezzlement and opium addiction. When interrogated, the defendant confessed that he had worked at the store for over 20 years and was burdened by family responsibilities after the war. He admitted to embezzling over 10,000 yuan from the store, but he was evasive about the rest. The court verified the confession and ordered a debate. The judge declared that the case was clear and immediately announced the verdict: Pu Qudan was sentenced to one year of imprisonment for embezzlement and eight months of imprisonment for opium addiction, to be served concurrently for a total of one year and two months, with deprivation of public rights for one year. The civil lawsuit portion was transferred to the Civil Division.</p>
<h3>Chauffeur Sentenced in Drug Case Appeals</h3>
<p>Chauffeur Zhang Zhengquan was driving his own car, No. 4734, in the spring of the year before last when he was stopped at the intersection of Julaida Road and Edward Road. French police detectives found over 100 taels of morphine in the car and arrested Zhang and impounded the car. Zhang claimed that the car owner was Zhu Ziyao, a wealthy real estate merchant living in Jing'an Villa, and that the drugs belonged to a Mr. Zhang at No. 36 Guba New Village, Guba Road. However, car owner Zhu Ziyao has avoided arrest since the incident. The initial trial resulted in Zhang Zhengquan being sentenced to 12 years of imprisonment and the car being confiscated. Zhang appealed to the Third Branch of the High Court, which reduced the sentence to seven years. However, Zhang and the car owner were still dissatisfied and appealed to the Supreme Court in the hope of getting the car back. As a result, the case was sent back for retrial. The case was concluded yesterday by a collegial panel of the Third Branch of the High Court, presided over by Acting Judge Chen Huoqich, along with Judges Wang and Gu. The court announced that the verdict would be announced on a scheduled date and ordered the defendant to be remanded in custody.</p>

<p>At 2:05 PM yesterday, a fire suddenly broke out on the upper floor of the Shu Xinzhai Incense and Candle Shop at No. 273, Avenue Minthé in the French Concession. Upon receiving the news, the Central Fire Brigade immediately dispatched vehicles to extinguish the fire. The fire was extinguished at 4:30 PM. The fire was started by Xu Ronggen, a tenant on the upper floor, because he was processing cotton and sparks flew into the cotton, causing the entire upper floor to be burned. Fortunately, it was during the day, and no one was injured.</p>
<p>Fan Qiuzhuang, a 45-year-old man from Chongming, lived at No. 14 Tangjiabang, Yinxiang Port, and made a living by growing vegetables.

<h3>New Contribution to the Textile Industry</h3>
<p>"Canvas" is the raw material for the hand embroidery industry, which used to be imported from Germany. After the embroidery shops added embroidered flowers, they were sold to Europe and the United States. There are already more than 20 embroidery factories in Shanghai alone, with a total of over 10,000 female workers. With the outbreak of the European war, this German "Canvas" could no longer be transported, so over 10,000 female workers in Shanghai were about to lose their jobs. Recently, Lai Hongda and others from the Datong Weaving Factory in Yongting Village, Caojiabo, have used decades of experience and knowledge to conduct careful research, spending half a year and millions of dollars, and have finally achieved success. The quality of their product surpasses that of imported goods, so various factories are competing to order it. Currently, the factory has a large demand and is preparing to expand.</p>

<h3>Case of Extortion Against Silk Merchants: One Suspect Apprehended; Handwriting Comparison Reveals Similar Numerals; Suspect Denies All Knowledge of Extortion</h3>
<p>Ye Yonghui, a Shaoxing native residing at No. 5 Qipu Road and operating a silk store, received three threatening letters from a criminal gang between the 3rd and 12th of this month, demanding 250,000 yuan or they would resort to drastic measures and endanger his life.  Shanghai Concession Police Force Detectives Shang Wu, Huang Fusen, and Shen Dehui apprehended a Shaoxing native named Tong Zhengchu (45 years old, an actor in the Shaoxing opera troupe at the Great World amusement center) in Room 422 of the Far East Hotel on Chatham Road, the suspected perpetrator in this case. He was escorted to the First Special District Court for further investigation. Yesterday morning, Judge Jiang Shuzi from the Criminal Third Tribunal continued the trial. Police lawyer Qian Xunjiu stated that a postponement was required. He requested that the defendant write three sheets of handwriting in the police station for comparison. The writing samples matched similar numerals in the second threatening letter. However, the defendant continued to deny any involvement and requested another adjournment. The three sheets of handwriting written by the defendant were presented to the court. Tong Zhengchu testified that he had been performing at the Great World for four years. At the time of his arrest, he was at Room 422 of the Far East Hotel, a company room opened by his colleague Yang Weixin, an investigator at the Great World and friends, gathered for mahjong to pass the time before being arrested by the police. He claimed to have no knowledge of the threatening letters and pleaded for leniency, hiring lawyers Yan Gang and Yu Enliang for his defense. Subsequently, Yang Weixin, a Suzhou native and investigator at the Great World, testified that he had instructed him to go to the Far East Hotel Room 422 to play mahjong, which he did. Judge Yu ordered him remanded in custody for further investigation in seven days.</p>
<h3>Tongrenhe Paint Store: Manager's Resignation Issue; Allegations of Embezzlement Previously Resolved; Manager Asserts Invalidity and Files Lawsuit</h3>
<p>The Tongrenhe Paint Store at No. 80 Min’guo Road in the French Concession is a business jointly established by members of the Yun family clan from Suzhou, with a history of sixty to seventy years. The shareholders appointed Xu Chengxun from Yuyao as the manager. In September of last year, Yun Huai’gao and other Yun family shareholders had a dispute with Manager Xu regarding sales. After auditing the accounts, irregularities were suspected and Manager Xu was suspected of</p>
<p>embezzlement.</p>
<p>On December 30th of last year, the shareholders appointed representatives to report the matter to the French Concession Police and suspended the accounting books. Both parties commissioned lawyers to negotiate a settlement. Xu submitted a letter to the shareholders declaring his resignation and waiving his profit share, requesting exemption from investigation into the sales dispute and outstanding accounts, to resolve the matter. On the 7th of this month, Xu Chengxun suddenly commissioned a lawyer to publish a statement declaring the previous letter invalid. The shareholders also commissioned a lawyer to publish a rebuttal. Xu then filed a lawsuit with the Civil Division of the Second Special District Court, seeking confirmation that the letter was invalid. Yesterday morning, Judge Chen Ziguan opened the Fourth Civil Tribunal to</p>
<p>summon both parties</p>
<p>for trial. Both parties sent representatives. The plaintiff, Xu Chengxun, was represented by lawyer Gao Danhua, who stated the reasons for requesting confirmation that the letter was invalid, claiming that Xu had been ill for many years, and had been recuperating for two to three years, submitting numerous medical prescriptions as evidence. He also stated that although the letter was certified by Xu's appointed lawyer, Xu Wufang, Xu himself claimed that he had not certified it. The defendant, Yun Huai’gao, was represented by lawyer Xu Jie, who argued that on September 2nd of last year, due to the outbreak of the European war, it was difficult to export goods to the Defu Foreign Firm. Xu was notified to temporarily suspend sales to prevent hoarding and speculation. Although Xu agreed, on September 11th it was discovered that he had</p>
<p>sold a large quantity.</p>
<p>The accounts recorded were all unfamiliar customer names, and there were no delivery receipts. After someone reported the matter, an audit was conducted, and Xu was deemed to be highly suspect. The matter was reported to the police for investigation. Before the account books were delivered and Yun Huai’gao's indictment was completed, Xu entrusted lawyer Xu Wufang to represent him and requested a settlement with Yun’s representative lawyer Qiu Fenling. He voluntarily resigned from his position as manager and was willing to compensate 50,000 yuan for the sales dispute, using his profit share as compensation. The amount of the profit share and the extent of the sales dispute damage were discussed. Xu was willing to treat the profit share and the damage from the sales dispute</p>
<p>as mutually settled.</p>
<p>He also requested the remission of 2,000 yuan in outstanding accounts. Xu issued a letter, certified by lawyer Xu Wufang. Because Xu requested funds for returning to his hometown for recuperation, the shareholders issued a promissory note for 10,000 yuan. The special remuneration was not fixed; in the past, it was to offset Xu’s excessive debts, nominally called special remuneration. At that time, Xu was eating fried rice with eggs and watermelon seeds in the police station. According to his newspaper advertisement, he received a letter from his father in the police station, indicating that he was very free and fully considered the matter. Xu had no objections. Only after many days did he publish a denial and renege on the agreement, which was unreasonable. He requested that the plaintiff’s lawsuit be dismissed. The court reviewed the facts and ordered witnesses and the plaintiff to be summoned to court for questioning, rescheduling the hearing for the 30th for further review.</p>
<h3>Rampant Robbery in Pudong</h3>
<p>Since the beginning of winter, robbery has been rampant in Pudong. Barehanded fake police officers have no security capabilities. Yesterday morning around 1 a.m., in the Tiandu area, bandits robbed eleven civilian households in a row. The victims included Xu Afang at No. 28 Tiandu Li, and his neighbors Zhuang Maomao, and Yang’s residence Yang Along, Yang Chongming, Yang Weimin, Yang Genbao, Yang Yu’mai, Yang Zhuangfa, Zhao Zhiming, Cao Asan, Chen Songlin, and other households. Money, jewelry, clothing, and bedding were all looted, with a total loss of two to three thousand yuan. The victim Zhuang Maomao was severely injured by being struck with the butt of a bandit’s gun because he refused to reveal the location of his hidden silver. The total number of bandits was more than ten, armed with different weapons such as rifles, handguns, and box guns. Furthermore, around 2 a.m. the day before yesterday, six or seven robbers broke into a nunnery fifteen doors east of Qichang Zhan. Finding no money, they beat up a nun to vent their anger and left.</p>

<h3>Food: Flour Prices Continue to Soar; Mills Cite Raw Material Issues, Intending to Hoard; Foreign Flour Available but Not Obtainable</h3>
<p>Flour</p>
<p>Yesterday, the No. 2 Flour Mill held firm at the original price of ten yuan, limiting supply and remaining strict. Each mill stated that the current raw material problem was not resolved temporarily. Domestic wheat was unreliable. Ordering foreign wheat lacked shipping space. Transactions were difficult. Although the flour inventory was ample, the mills were unwilling to sell easily due to the large profit margin and unwilling to increase production. Buyer bids have been suspended for several days. Only a few merchant single flours were being traded in the market in small batches on this street. It was heard that the selling price of Chechuan brand flour had risen sharply from ten yuan and nine jiao or nine jiao half to a peak of eleven yuan and four jiao or eleven yuan and five jiao, a surge of five or six jiao compared to the previous day, which was alarming. This was all incited by those restricting supplies. In the foreign flour market, after continuous speculator activity, holders took advantage of the opportunity to hoard. Although the market price was eleven yuan and five or six jiao, there were few available stocks. Compared with domestic flour, it was still cheaper. This situation was all created by a major mill. It was stated that if foreign flour was exhausted, they could manipulate the market freely with the largest scale of production. Trading in domestic flour was limited to about 10,000 bags of small batches on this street. The trading volume of foreign flour was also only two to three thousand bags.</p>
<p>Wheat</p>
<p>The wheat market has become increasingly brisk recently. Amid serious rumors of rising flour prices, holders naturally regarded their goods as a rare commodity. Therefore, those offering samples for sale on the market could be described as disappearing without a trace. Each mill stated that although there was a need for raw materials currently, there were no large quantities of goods available at high prices. It was heard that the Fuxin and Fufeng Mills had previously ordered Australian foreign wheat, one ship each, which would arrive in Shanghai before the lunar new year, at which time the market might change slightly. The current market trend has become difficult to curb. Yesterday, the selling price of wheat was 18 yuan and 5 jiao. Some buyers absorbed the supply, while the sellers then raised the price to 19 yuan. The two sides then reached an impasse.</p>
<h3>Rice Merchants' Desire to Manipulate Remains Undiminished; New Year Sales Season Brings More Speculation; Wuxi Rice Prices Also Manipulated</h3>
<p>Rice market transactions are changing. Various rices have returned to high prices because the supply from the interior is not large. Furthermore, there are many twists and turns in transferring out of the Hongkou district. Few are transported to the concession for listing. For foreign rice, owners are unwilling to easily sell due to silver prices. Coupled with soaring flour prices, the equivalent weight calculation greatly exceeds the rice price. Rice merchants and hoarders feel there are more opportunities to take. Customers are preparing for the new spring year and must purchase goods, so sales are more robust. At the beginning of the market, there were still returned goods for mutual transfer, and the situation was still stable. Later, they had to purchase from the original customer vendors, and the price was increasing, so the sales situation became more lively. In addition to the native shop , most of the inland merchants were willing to sell in bulk. At this point, each price for thick or thin, japonica, early rice, and white rice increased by 4 or 5 jiao, and Saigon and other foreign rice increased by 6 or 7 jiao. Until nearly noon, there were more who took advantage of the high prices to return. The price also fell back by 1 to 3 jiao. Therefore, the price of domestic and foreign rice increased by 4 jiao compared to the previous. The closing price for No. 1 Saigon was 38 yuan and 1 jiao, 38 yuan, No. 2 Saigon 37 yuan and 3 jiao, 37 yuan, and Fired Rice 37 yuan, 1 or 2 jiao. Statistics showed that no less than 20,000 bags were sold throughout the city. This was one of the most robust days of sales during the week.</p>
<p>After the opening of the foreign rice market in the morning, the clients' appetites were greedy, and the overseas pricing also increased. The difference between Nos. 1 and 2 was nearly one yuan, making it even more difficult to reconcile. Even the broken rice telegram showed a good return of 2 jiao. The previously scheduled 33-yuan broken rice had to be at 33 yuan and 3 jiao to continue. There was a deal for about 1,000 tons of each. The market's current supply is also tight, and it is 3, 4, or 5 jiao greater than the previous market.</p>
<p>Yesterday, another 3,491 bags of foreign rice arrived from the Taikoo Company Jiangsu Yu from Hong Kong and unloaded at the French Concession Main Warehouse.</p>
<p>Rice and grain without pots are still prohibited from leaving the country. The selling price of high-quality goods is 20 yuan and 5 jiao per stone. With the Lunar New Year approaching, farmers need money and are selling in scattered quantities in urban and rural areas. Sources arriving from various routes are also very enthusiastic, but prices are being manipulated by both merchants and customers, making it difficult to expect a fallback.</p>
<h3>Securities: Domestic Debt Rebounds; Most Losses Recovered</h3>
<p>The stock market situation yesterday confirmed that the rumors spread the previous day were unfounded. The market mentality suddenly turned stable. With the absorption of each gang, market prices gradually rose. Most of the losses from the previous day were recovered. Among them, Types A and D were even higher than the previous day due to supply not meeting demand. Type A was drawing near the lottery, which was drawing as many as twenty-six signs. Type D attracted much attention because the market price was lower. With the interest payment period approaching, the prospect should still have a good market. There were more transactions yesterday morning. Runli Tongshen absorbed as much as possible in the sell-off of Jiufeng and Dafeng. The market rose in a natural state. Later, because Xinfu and No. 20 were still in great need, there were few sellers, and the price was more firm. Hengfu Tongkang frequently moved in and out. Gongmao and Shunkang focused on Types D and E. In the afternoon, Defu and No. 40 had a strong appetite, and Lianhe Tongkang sold slightly. There were few transactions. Throughout the day, most of the retail investors were long rather than short. The market price ended with a return of 1.5 to 5.5 jiao. The total number of transactions was 600,000 to 700,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below.</p>
<p>Stock trading: 50 shares of the Bank of China were traded at a price of 58 yuan and 7 jiao cattle.</p>
<p>The public works stock market was slightly bleak. Price fluctuations for each stock were very slight. Transactions were also sparse. Industrial stocks remained stable. Rubber stocks had a small amount of buying activity throughout the day.</p>
<p>London, 18th: Today, the stock market for British companies in the Orient continued to soften. The stock price of the Chartered Bank of India, Australia and China continued to fall by 5 shillings, to £8 7s 6d. The share price of the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, registered in London, remained unchanged. The share price registered in Hong Kong fell by one eighth to £86. The share price of Gula-Klang Rubber fell by 7.5 pence to 21 shillings and 10.5 pence. The rest were flat.</p>
<p>London, 18th: Today, the listed market prices of Chinese foreign debt remained stable. There were no changes to each debt.</p>
<h3>Finance: Foreign Exchange Becomes Stable</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign exchange market revealed that the HSBC acceptance bill remained unchanged. Because of the rumors of the previous day, the dark market for British and American exchange rates was no longer heard. Market psychology turned stable and the situation turned calm. The results were slightly loosened. After the day had passed, the British and American exchange rates suddenly reported a return of 1.125 points. It had an inverse appearance of British flat and American hard. The opening price was 4.828125 and 7.96875.

Later, the foreign firms rose slightly, and once softened slightly.

The silver balance tax revealed a rise of 2 points. After that, the foreign bank community had some scattered settlements. It softened slightly. The American exchange made 7.9375.

<h3>Gold Market Re-Enters Weary Path</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the dark market for cash scorched earth, although it had rebounded the previous day, had returned to be powerless and downward. It returned to the weary state, in a single defeat. It only closed at a low price that day because the rumors in the market the previous day had no basis and were difficult to believe. The foreign exchange hardened. The Hong Kong help's actual needs were also not smooth, so the market mentality was volatile. The selling wind stayed for a long time, so it was not easy to dissipate. In the morning, the market mentality turned soft. There was much selling intent. The silver floor help sought to sell, and buyers watched carefully. Therefore, the opening price fell by 10 yuan to 4070 yuan. The market price was lowered again by 15 yuan during sparse transactions. Because the Hong Kong help saw the cheapness, they pounced on it, so the falling wind was slightly stable. At 11 o'clock, the exchange market reported loosening, and the buyers retreated. It fell to 4048 yuan at the close. In the afternoon, the exchange market was quiet, and ups and downs were even more plain. Only the initial opening was raised several yuan because a certain securities company searched for it, but after entering it suddenly reverted. Therefore, it was finally reduced to 4045 yuan at the close, down 35 yuan compared to the previous day. The whole day's transactions were light. Silver floor ornaments were unchanged. Customs gold was still flat.</p>
<p>Scorched Earth Little 35 Yuan</p>
<p>Since the morning, the (ten taels) opening was because the rumors from the previous day were unfounded, and the exchange market was quite fixed, so the market mentality turned to selling intent. The silver floor help was the first to agree to supply, but the buying appetite was extremely weak, causing the opening to fall by 10 yuan. The silver floor help sold to the gold company for 20 taels for 4070 yuan. In a short time, the money exchange also followed and spat it out, continuing to fall by 10 yuan. The money exchange industry sold to the gold company for 20 taels for 4060 yuan. Later, a certain silver bank and a certain securities help absorbed it and returned 8 yuan. The silver floor help entered the securities help 20 taels for 4068 yuan. After this, another securities help continued to come out , and the cash company supply was not small. Although the Hong Kong help had come to buy it, the head position still felt the unevenness of the request, so after a short time it again 12 yuan. The securities help spat out to the money exchange industry 20 taels for 4055 yuan. At that time, a certain securities help came to drag it in again, once returning to 5 yuan. However, after the exchange market reported loosening, sellers poured in, and a certain two money exchange industries competed to block, and scattered households also had a strong selling intent, causing it to decline again. Soon after, a silver bank sold to the silver floor help 10 taels for 4045 yuan, the silver bank suddenly made another customer grab it, raising 3 yuan, entering the securities help 10 taels, taking 4048 yuan as the afternoon close price. In the afternoon, the securities help first came to buy in, and at that time the sellers watched, and the opening was high at 7 yuan. The silver floor help gave the securities help 10 taels for 4055 yuan. Later, the gold company saw a high sell-off, so it pressed down 8 yuan, the gold company sold to the money exchange industry 10 taels for 4047 yuan. Then, a certain silver bank slightly came to grab it, raising 5 yuan again, the gold company entered the securities help 20 taels for 4052 yuan. A person who suddenly came to return again, the securities help took out 7 yuan, the money exchange industry gave the securities help 20 taels for 4045 yuan as the late close price. The result was a fall of 35 yuan. The whole day was 25 yuan. The cash number's selling price of the standard gold was several yuan higher, the herding decreased by 20 yuan, and the current standard gold was more than 50 yuan lower than the listed gold, so they all rarely did open.</p>
<p>Ornamental Gold Still Hangs at the Old Price</p>
<p>Silver floor ornaments, per tael of redemption, are still unchanged, and remain the same. Da Tong Hang still suspended 410 yuan. The new peer industry is the same as the upper price. The herding decreases by about 15 yuan.</p>
<h3>Foreign Currency Supply Exceeds Demand</h3>
<p>Yesterday, because the rumors from the night before were incorrect, foreign currency prices again softened and declined. British and American gold pounds both lacked demand, and the market was weak. British and American gold bills surged in supply and sharply decreased in price. Early in the morning, the American gold bill fell to 12 yuan and 4 jiao and 3 fen. Although customers took advantage of the low price to absorb the supply, it was difficult to reverse the decline due to smooth supply. The price fell to 12 yuan and 4 jiao and 4 fen in the evening market. Because the Hong Kong exchange rate was weak, the Hong Kong bill price was slightly cheaper. There was little demand for French franc bills, and the price slightly loosened. The Canada bill followed the American gold bill and weakly declined. The Japanese gold bill was slightly firm, with the evening market at 1 yuan, 2 jiao, and 6 fen. The Korean bill had very high demand, with the evening market at 1 yuan and 0 jiao and 2.5 fen. Yesterday's market price, British and American gold were both down 5 jiao, British gold bills were down jiao, American gold bills were down jiao 7 fen, Hong Kong bills were down fen, French franc bills were down , Canada bills were down jiao, other currencies were not changed.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: The Yarn Market Remains Depressed as Before</h3>
<p>The yarn market is still ordinary and without highlights. The near new year, increased inventory, and the customer's practical needs are all factors that make the market depressed. The market transactions are stagnant and very scattered.</p>
<p>The yarn price fell because the rumours of the previous afternoon were all castles in the air. The doubts have been dispelled. There were more bulls in the field, but there were very few buyers. The opening price of 20s Double Horse was 726 yuan. As soon as this price opened, buyers were very few. At the same time, the foreign exchange was also peaceful, and there was no news that would make people excited. It then fell to 724 yuan.

<h3>The Cotton Market Will Wait For The Coming Season</h3>
<p>Transactions in local cotton remain quiet. All parties have no active mindset. Foreign Indian cotton is also fluctuating. The market mentality is plain. However, lately the price of middling American cotton has been relatively cheap. From Northern Jiangsu came 280 packages of toong hua cotton, and 160 packages from Changyinsha. The present transaction amounts are written below.</p>

Generally, manufacturers expect that cotton prices will be very good after the new year. Here are yesterday’s cotton market prices in conjunction with an exchange rate of 7.9375 with the manufacturer’s prices.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Domestic Sales of Cotton Cloth Are Diminished.</h3>
<p>Sales of cotton cloth to foreign, Hong Kong, and Nanyang are smooth and active. Only domestic sales have shrunk. As the end of the year approaches, customers are getting tight on silver. Therefore, although the mill increased prices, profit on selling by hand at a low price is not few. There are great differences in the market, and the difference is 1 jiao to 5 jiao. Yesterday's market price was level. Yihua, Huaxin, Zhenzhong, and other manufacturers' coarse and fine cloth were opened for 2,000 pieces. The current price is half a jiao to five jiao higher. On the street, printing factories bought a great amount of white cloth. Guangdong bought over 200 pieces of coarse cloth, bleached cloth, color twill, and color cloth.

<h3>The Sugar Market: It's Difficult for Diaoqing to Increase</h3>

DY was 57 yuan. There were no other fluctuations. Only Guang opened ordinary Beihai white for sale for a few packages, for 51.2 yuan. South River Thanh called for 48 yuan without trade. Diaoqing remains hesitant, and it does not seem likely to increase. Two hundred seventy packages of sugar were brought from Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>North and South Goods: Zalu Guiyuan Briefly Opened</h3>
<p>Zalu Guiyuan has been scattered recently. Yesterday, several tens of boxes of old goods were traded. The higher ones were 105 yuan, 92 yuan, and small 55 yuan. New goods are still arriving, and are still being reported.</p>
<h3>Coal</h3>
<p>Coal Balls Rise Again, Association Resolves to Increase by Four Dollars</p>
<p>Due to competition among businesses at the beginning of the month, coal ball businesses experienced a price drop and dumping, leading to market chaos and inconsistent factory prices. Recently, due to the increased cost of raw materials from Hongji sawdust, the industry association yesterday resolved to increase factory prices by four dollars, effective immediately. Specifically, Yitai, Xingnan, Nanyang, and Guohua coal ball companies will charge eighty dollars per ton, self-pickup, plus two dollars for delivery by cart. Retail price at shops is four dollars and forty cents per load.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea</h3>
<p>Silk Market in Transition</p>
<p>Yesterday, the silk market saw mixed ups and downs. Spot prices in New York were already recovering. Raw silk prices varied by fractions of cents. Shanghai silk rose by six cents, while near-term exchange sales rose but long-term prices fell by one and a half cents. Yokohama spot prices rose by ten yuan in the morning and sixty-five yuan in the afternoon, while long-term prices fell by fifteen cents and then rose by seventy-five yuan in the afternoon. The future of the silk market remains uncertain. The price surge a month ago lacked a solid foundation, and the current severe drop is not due to relaxed supply and demand. The main reason is the changing political climate in Japan and the shifts in Japanese-American business relations. Therefore, the future of the silk market will continue to change along with international relations. The silk market in this port is not experiencing excessive panic due to the prosperous business of the previous year. However, the price of silk has indeed fallen drastically. Yesterday, the market in this port seemed slightly more stable. White silk "B" grade 7 or 8 is still selling for five thousand yuan. Xinfu and others have imported ten loads, while French firms are offering prices as low as four thousand nine hundred yuan, which is still unsellable. Indian silk prices are not dropping as severely because of shortages of both domestic and international stocks, but transactions are difficult to complete.</p>

<h3>Covering One's Ears While Stealing a Bell</h3>
<p>— Huang Jiayin</p>
<p>All lawbreakers, regardless of who they are, are immediately thrown into high-walled, heavily guarded prisons. This may be the simplest way to deal with "social criminals," but it is not the most civilized, reasonable, or appropriate method.</p>
<p>Modern psychology, criminology, and sociology have all advanced. We know that most criminals are driven by environmental temptations and pressures. Some commit crimes due to improper education, bad habits, or physical ailments. Only a very small number of people break the law due to hereditary defects.</p>
<p>For those who are tempted and pressured by their environment, we should change their environment. For those who are improperly educated or uneducated, we should provide them with correct education. For those with bad habits, we should help them change those habits. And for those with physical ailments, we should treat their conditions. If we continue to indiscriminately lock up all "social criminals" together, and release them after their "sentence is served," leaving them to fend for themselves afterwards, isn't this like covering one's ears while stealing a bell? No wonder prisons are overcrowded!</p>
<p>For criminals, we should use scientific methods to analyze, study, and treat each case as a symptom of an illness.</p>
<p>As the times progress, our methods of dealing with criminals should also advance!</p>
<h3>Wartime Berlin in Correspondence  Donglin</h3>
<p>It has been three or four months since the war began. The most worrying thing in Berlin is the lack of food. Pork and beef are completely unavailable, with only venison, wild boar, and wild duck. These are hunted from hunting areas and forests. However, for the average person, these are not only unappetizing, but also frighteningly expensive.</p>
<p>Housewives spend hours every day queuing to buy food. If a guest arrives and doesn't bring food, they will simply have to go home hungry. Most Berlin residents return home before dark and sit under lights that don't leak light. It's too dangerous to go outside.</p>
<p>Germans can only get one bar of soap per month, so there isn't enough soap to shave with, leading to most men having full beards. Interestingly, the Hitler Youth League recently stipulated that kissing men with full beards should not be refused.</p>
<p>The import tax has increased by 50%, the cigarette tax by 20%, and the beer tax by 14%. Therefore, Berliners can't afford foreign goods, and even cigarettes and beer are becoming unaffordable.</p>
<p>The war has also greatly affected the business of prostitutes. Because men are not happy to go out on dark streets after dark, and most of the strong men have gone to the battlefield.</p>
<p>Radio stations have no fixed programs to broadcast. All that is broadcast is government reports, talks to strengthen combat awareness, and propaganda, interspersed with marches and classical music.</p>
<p>Newspapers have been reduced by half, and all newspapers are filled with the same news. The content is nothing more than formulaic government announcements, comments on Germany from countries maintaining friendly relations, and articles attacking Britain. They only treat Britain as a mortal enemy, and don't say much bad about France.</p>
<p>There is also a shortage of clothing and food. Men are only allowed to have two suits, four undershirts, and six pairs of socks. If you want to buy new ones, you have to bring the old ones.</p>
<p>The abuse of Jews is getting worse every day. Everyone is worried that other foreigners will face the same treatment in the near future.</p>
<p>The people of Germany are silent, with sad expressions on their faces. They don't seem enthusiastic about the war, and they don't like to talk about it. When they meet on the street or in public places, they just greet each other listlessly.</p>
<p>A Frightened Bird  Meng Gu</p>

<p>Cultivation in Leisure Time  K</p>
<p>The meaning of publishing this article is not to advocate leisure, but to advocate the cultivation of leisure. We feel that leisure is a right that every living person should have, and that the cultivation of leisure is an art of life.</p>
<p>— Editor</p>
<p>There are two kinds of people in the world who are most pitiful: those who are busy from morning to night, and those who are busy with nothing to do day and night. Neither of them has the opportunity to enjoy the happiness of leisure. Leisure is different from laziness: laziness is not doing what should be done, which is a dereliction of duty; leisure is the remaining free time after the things that should be done are finished. How to use this remaining time is the source of happiness or pain in life.</p>
<p>Enjoying leisure is not an easy task, but you should try it, because without it, you have no other way to seek a kind of cultivation, to generate an energy in life to cope with difficult undertakings; you have no other way to gently tap the source of spirit, in other words, you must first obtain a kind of wisdom in non-action before you can act.</p>
<p>Watching movies, dancing, playing golf, and taking car rides in one's spare time are not true enjoyment of leisure. The conditions for true leisure are very simple: to relax tense muscles, to stop thinking about doing something, and to temporarily become a maple leaf floating in the wind, or a stone. You must exchange the cultural person's planned activities, planned thoughts, and all the habits that make people tired for spiritual ease and freedom. In short, you must do nothing. When you learn this, your realm of consciousness will open up a new world, with a peace and clarity of mind and body that you have never had before. This realm has an incomparable power to revive the spirit from fatigue.</p>
<p>If you are wearing glasses, take them off, as even that slight pressure on the bridge of your nose is enough to cause distress. You should also loosen your belt and tie, then lie down and rest. Don't think about anything, let your spirit rise. On your newly liberated consciousness will immediately arise a kind of semi-clear and semi-obscure thought, various memories and awakenings will also surge forth, because the suppression of your thoughts and the suppression of your actions have now been defeated, and your spirit has the opportunity to appreciate the fragrance of flowers in a bottle. This fragrance has already permeated the room, but because your spirit is not free, you have not been able to obtain it. An easy-going spirit has a mysterious sense of power, and this fragrance will be deeply inhaled into the lungs, and there will be another feeling, that the sun is shining on your hands. At that point, with your nostrils full of the fragrance of flowers and your skin feeling the sunshine, the world is not so bad after all. You have finally entered a lovely and secret realm, which only those who understand the cultivation of leisure can enter. Returning to this peaceful and quiet life is a cultivation worth learning.</p>
<p>Random Notes: Spider Webs  Pinpin</p>
<p>In the corners of the room, under the table, at the head of the bed, and by the cabinet, spiders have spun webs. The spider squats in the center of the web, with its rear end facing the sky, not moving an inch. The shape of the web is a geometric circle, swaying gently in the wind, like a kite, but it is often hung with a few scattered specks of dust.</p>
<p>I am a person who hates spider webs very much. I don't know what inspiration King Alfred received from spider webs to learn a lesson, but I think this is probably just a legend. No one in the world likes this dirty and ugly thing.</p>
<p>Needless to say, spider webs are dirty. A perfectly clean room, with a web hanging here and a net spun there, clinging to dust, in strings and balls, the room has many sores, and touching it brings a handful of filth. If this thing doesn't disgust people, what else will? Brightness, like sunlight through crystal, and cleanliness, like dewdrops on lotus petals, this is the way to live. Dirt is unacceptable.</p>
<p>Spider webs are also ugly. Hidden in the shadows, waving in the wind, innocent little moths and insects, either inadvertently or lured by the patterns of the web, fly in and get eaten by that great demon king. The spider grows fat, fattened by eating the blood of others. If you look closely at a spider, you will be shocked. You won't believe there is another animal more bizarre than it, like an octopus, like a crab, and like a centipede—the shadow of the devil. Having spawned this strange thing, this ugly thing, can we stand by and let it run rampant?</p>
<p>Filthy, tempting, blood-sucking, grotesque, devilish spider webs, let us sweep them away and restore our cleanliness, freedom, happiness, and liberation!</p>
<p>Therefore, as soon as I see a spider web, I will burn it with fire—I feel that using a bamboo pole to poke at it is too light a punishment. I light the fire and aim at the spider's abdomen. Very quickly, before it can escape, there is a "sizzle" sound, and the spider falls headfirst, its legs crushed, its head shrunken, with only the last thin thread hanging from its tail. Thinking it could dominate one side with its fragile web, the spider finally died under the fire because of its greed. Yes, fire is a symbol of light and struggle. Without fire, the devil cannot be driven away.</p>
<p>O fire of light and struggle! How grateful we will be to you, because you have driven out the hateful monster and crushed it. The descendants of Prometheus should use fire to fight against the forces of darkness, just as I use fire to destroy spider webs.</p>
<p>Scientific Bakelite Airplane  Jieliu</p>
<p>Bakelite has a wide range of uses, but using it to manufacture airplanes is a new undertaking.</p>
<p>Ordinary metal airplanes are difficult to manufacture. First, the metal is too heavy, and second, the assembly of the airplane parts, such as rivets, is very troublesome. Therefore, a generation of aircraft manufacturers has tried using Bakelite to manufacture airplanes.</p>
<p>Several years ago, the United States manufactured a Bakelite airplane, which British Prime Minister Chamberlain test-flew and was very satisfied with. Recently, Mr. Clark of the United States has also built many airplanes with Bakelite frames, and the Bakelite he uses is called Duramold.</p>
<p>Clark's airplane has a horsepower of 400 and is made entirely of Bakelite and cloth. The fuselage is exceptionally smooth and does not have rivets all over the body like metal airplanes. The airplane's frame is fused together because Bakelite has a sticky material. Therefore, the fuselage is exceptionally strong, and because Bakelite does not burn and does not have the violent vibrations of metal, it is not easily damaged, and passengers sit comfortably inside.</p>
<p>It is said that it only takes two hours to manufacture the backbone of this type of Bakelite airplane, but how it is manufactured is kept highly secret by the authorities, and the outside world has no way to find out.</p>
<p>Clark's Bakelite airplane can carry about five passengers, and its flight speed can be increased by 7% compared to ordinary airplanes. The weight of the airplane is also smaller than ordinary airplanes, but Bakelite airplanes are still being tested and improved. If they can be manufactured on a large scale, then the current metal airplanes will inevitably be eliminated.</p>
<p>Things to Talk About  Tailuo</p>
<p>The sun emits 360 trillion tons of heat every 24 hours. If you want to create the same amount of heat artificially, you need to burn 300 million trillion tons of coal per minute.</p>
<p>There are currently 55,259 physicians in Germany, of which 4,339 are women. In the past two years, the increase rate of male and female doctors is 6%, while the increase rate of female doctors is more than 19%.</p>

<p>Show Business Starts with Yang Baosen as the Headliner, Talking About the Need for Second-Tier Lao Sheng Actors  Biyu</p>
<p>News from Beiping says that after returning to Ping from Shanghai, the laosheng actor Yang Baosen has decided to form his own troupe. He has already begun to assemble a cast, and his brother Yang Baozhong has therefore parted ways with Ma Lianliang and is preparing to cooperate with his brother, playing the accompanying music for Baosen. It is said that Bosen's troupe has already invited the dan actor Hu Bilan to join, and they will soon be performing in Ping.</p>
<p>The news about Yang Baosen forming a troupe is both joyful and sad. The joy is that Baosen will no longer have to live under someone else's roof, and the sadness is that in this situation where second-tier laosheng actors are as rare as morning stars, Baosen can be said to be a phoenix feather among them. Once he forms a troupe, there will definitely be no suitable candidates for second-tier laosheng actors.</p>
<p>The trend of laosheng actors forming troupes began with Ma Lianliang (during Yu Shuyan's heyday, he either cooperated with Xiao Lou or with Lanfang, and never formed his own troupe, and if he did, it was only for one or two performances). After Lianliang, Yan Jupeng rose, and later there were Li Shengzao and Tan Fuying. With the laosheng actors breaking off and forming their own troupes, dan actors were deeply afraid that no one would carry the sword, so the Four Great Dan Actors invited their own private second-tier laosheng actors, the so-called private second-tier laosheng actors, who specialized in performing plays for this one dan actor and did not join other troupes. This is what is meant by Mei and Xi Xiaobo, Cheng and Wang Shaolou, Gou and Wang Wenyuan, and Shang and Wang Fengqing. Among these four people, except for Xi Xiaobo, who also formed his own troupe because Mei did not perform, the remaining two had contracts with the dan actors and could no longer cooperate with other actors. In other words, these three had no possibility of forming a troupe, but it is precisely because of this that second-tier laosheng actors are becoming increasingly scarce.</p>
<p>Among today's second-tier laosheng actors, Yang Baosen is especially regarded as one of the most popular and best. Therefore, many actors invite Yang Baosen. Due to the creation of the situation, although Baosen is named a second-tier laosheng actor, his influence is no less than that of the headliner laosheng actors Xi Xiaobo, Li Shengzao, and others. Baosen's art is indeed praiseworthy, but there are not many plays that can attract audiences, so in terms of reason, Baosen should not form his own troupe at this time. In addition to Baosen, Chen Shaolin is also a leader among the second-tier laosheng actors in the north. However, Shaolin's voice is extremely narrow, causing many famous actors such as Wang Yurong and Nan Tiesheng to invite Guan Shaohua to Shanghai last time. Although he did not become popular, he is highly appreciated by the general public in the north. In addition, Shaohua has a good temper and a clever price, and has become one of the busiest second-tier laosheng actors. In addition to Shaohua, there is also Jia Shaotang, whose art is far inferior to Shaohua. Guan Dayuan is also a second-tier laosheng actor with a good reputation. Now that he has come south, one talent is invisibly missing from the second-tier laosheng actors. Chang Liheng cooperates with Huang Yulin, and although he is a second-tier laosheng actor, few northern actors invite him to cooperate. Zhang Ruting does not seem to be in Ping. Recently, Song Dezhu returned to Ping from Shanghai, and the laosheng role was filled by Ma Decheng. Ma was originally a Huang-style martial arts actor, but now he also works as a laosheng actor. The lack of talent in second-tier laosheng actors in the north can be imagined.</p>
<p>Show Business News: Dancer's Tears  Xiaotian</p>
<p>Why is it that a person who is born of the same parents is respected when she is a "Miss", while I, as a dancer, am insulted by so many people? Is she born smarter, and am I born stupid? Every time the sun sets, I just crawl out of bed and rush to the hair salon. I watch groups of students carrying their schoolbags, chatting and laughing as they run towards their homes. I think I will never enjoy this kind of happiness in this life. Their problems with food, clothing, housing, and transportation have long been arranged by their parents. If they don't know a word, they can ask their father, and if they don't understand something, they can ask their mother. If they are too lazy to do something, they can order a servant. When they are cold, hot, hungry, or sick, there is always someone caring and looking after them. What about us? We return from sitting on the cold bench in the dance hall with a belly full of anger, and our mothers cannot help but nag. But tomorrow, tomorrow we still have to go to the dance floor. Stockings must be worn, high heels must be worn, handbags must be carried, clothes must be varied, rouge and powder must be applied, hair salons must be visited, and fingernails must be manicured. These days, everything is expensive. Just buying a box of lipstick costs three to five dollars. All in all, it costs thirty to fifty dollars a month, and accompanying people for seventy to eighty or a hundred dances is just enough to cover the costs. Do you think this business is easy to do? Furthermore, if you are popular, you are busy all day long, and your legs hurt from dancing. This is all part of the job. Sometimes, when several guests call at the same time, calling for you to sit with them and calling for you to go out to dinner, it is difficult to appease all of them. Sometimes, if you are not careful and offend a guest, you will inevitably be ridiculed, cold-shouldered, etc. Maybe you will even get slapped, and you can only suffer in silence. There is also a type of person who puts on a smiling face and dances with you for free, and that's not enough. He always wants to grope you. Even if you give him what he wants, he still says that we are not worth a cent to others. Are we just born to be lowly? Some people say, if you are popular, you can save a little more money. It's hard to believe, but we can buy more jewelry and clothes, which is considered good. Mother is always the first to ask for money, and father also wants money. The siblings and brothers-in-law want the most, and the worst are the men (originally, a small half of the dancers' families were supporting men, some married, some unmarried, and some just cohabiting). We have also thought carefully about what will happen if we don't marry and when we get old and can't sell our beauty. Our own mother will die before us, and our stepmother won't care about us when we can't make money for her anymore. If we marry a rich man and become his concubine, his house is already full of wives and children, and he may not allow us to live with him. Even if we force our way in, we will inevitably be envied, despised, and insulted. If we live separately, we have no legal status at all. Rich men's feelings are probably fleeting. Once he falls in love with someone else, we can cry ourselves to death in front of him, but we will inevitably be abandoned. If we are still young at that time, we can go back to our old business and barely survive. But if we are old, then we are really helpless. If we marry a poor man, alas, supporting a man is such an awful term. Not only does it sound bad, but in reality, we are like fresh flowers that are trampled on for nothing, earning money to support him. Although he may offer some small courtesies like pouring water and wiping shoes, as for the future, a person who can't even support himself, how can we expect him to support his wife in the future? So we just live our lives day by day, without feeling anything. But when it's late at night and we are alone, thinking about our future, it's like ten thousand arrows piercing our heart, and we stare blankly at the sky until dawn.</p>
<p>Zhang Cuihong's Last Work  Yuan Hong</p>
<p>Classical beauty Zhang Cuihong, because her husband Xu Heng (not the goalkeeper sports star) did not want her delicate body working day and night in the photography studio, had long advised her to retire to her family. Miss Zhang accepted all of her [husband's] kind intentions. However, [China United Beauty]'s debut work, [Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai], is her lead role, and there is a reason for this.</p>
<p>[China United Beauty] was jointly established by film industry tycoons Yan Chuntang, Zhang Shankun, Wu Bangfan, Yu Ying, Li Dashen, Yan Youxiang, and others. The purpose is to seek thorough cooperation in the film industry. Therefore, directors and actors are hired from various companies. The heads believed that Zhang Cuihong was the most qualified for the female lead Zhu Yingtai, so they sincerely invited her with the collective face and sincerity. Although Zhang Cuihong had no intention of working on the screen, she had no choice but to reluctantly agree out of consideration for the kindness of so many people. So this play may be Zhang Cuihong's last work. Perhaps she will come out again in three to five years, but at least for those years, we will not see her new works.</p>
<p>Early Birth of a Precious Child is a film depicting the psychological states of various women regarding childbearing. The image above is a scene from the film.</p>
<p>Tales from the Pot Studio  Su Shaoqing</p>
<p>The Red-Haired Devil Liu Tang's Mistake Regarding the Eight-Inch Leg (Part 1)</p>
<p>The novel Water Margin is wonderful in its depiction of characters. The 108 people each have their own personality and tone. Dramas adopt stories from this book the most, and the 36 Heavenly Spirits are the most famous. Therefore, the names and nicknames of the 36 people are recorded in the collective novels, which is proof that they were real people. However, there are quite a few differences in nicknames and personal names. Now I will pick up a few people to elicit a smile.</p>
<p>In the play Sitting in the Tower to Kill Xi at the Wulong Temple, there is a scene of Liu Tang delivering a letter. Liu Tang's nickname is Red-Haired Devil, which can be found in Yihe's Anecdotes, as well as Water Margin. Liu Bao sings a line in the Wulong Temple drum song: [The Red-Haired Devil Little Liu Tang delivers the letter,] (According to the Water Margin story, a small word is added in the sentence, which is used for singing to make the sentence,) According to Zhou Mi of the Southern Song Dynasty's Sequel to Xin Zashi, there is a section that reprints Xi Ju and others' Eulogy to Song Jiang and the 36 People, the sixth person is Liu Tang with the Eight-Inch Leg, the eulogy says: [The general is short, the book calls him a marquis and king, you are not a man, your legs are eight inches long.] It means that Liu Tang's legs are short, only eight inches long, so he is called Eight-Inch Leg, not Red-Haired Devil. Mr. Xi had seen the images of Gao Ru, Li Chong, and 36 others, saying that Liu Tang's short legs must be correct. The six characters Eight-Inch Leg and Red-Haired Devil have the same sounds and rhymes. The character [hair] can also be read with the sound of [eight], and both are entering tone characters. [Devil] and [leg] can also have the same rising tone. It is a mistake in the spoken change of written words, and because he has not seen the portraits or Mr. Xi and Mr. Zhou's records.</p>
