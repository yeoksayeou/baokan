<h3>歐戰與越南</h3>
<p>昨日歐洲電訉：英國空軍於前夜越海長征，對德京柏林作處女的進攻；同時，德機八百架亦突襲英倫東南部；總之，英德兩國間之戰局，迄今繼續不斷開展於緊張之中，未稍緩弛。然其間有可視爲頓挫之符節者，英國報紙僉認爲德國攻英戰事至是自成一章而終了其第一階段，且謂英國守勢業已戰勝德國之初步攻勢；義大利名記者蓋達氏則著論警告英國，謂勿因未被摧毀而自命勝利云；然則雙方於今日以前交戰之得失利鈍，縱日仁智異見，主客殊觀，而綜觀英義論述，其爲或大或小之之段落無疑。其間更有可視爲劇中之挿曲者，某方電傳，敎皇庇護斯十二世曾於本月二十日延見美國總統派駐敎廷之特使戴樂氏，就如何條件之下，可使英國視爲無損名譽而接受和平？就德義兩國所計劃之歐洲新秩序中，英國將擔當何種任務？諄囑戴樂氏徵詢羅斯福氏之意見；因敎皇認爲英德戰爭至於現階段，從事和解之機會已告成熟云。夫吾儕近頃之所見聞，但覺歐局波濤之彌見壯闊，歐空爭覇之愈戰愈酣；顧乃英義報人雖稱戰事必更逐步演進，却共認爲旣告段落；敎廷方面不但視爲段落，且以爲息戰謀和旣得其機運；此其見地，洵難想像，而使吾儕不無迷惑之感者也。此一事也。法屬越南之爲問題，近之有關國際之縱橫，友敵之分野；遠之有關戰後之局勢，資源之窮通。凡與越南有直接間接利害關係之各國之中，除法國倘能力自淬勵，策其智勇，體認退讓之無殊於斷送，便佞之不足以圖全，不避艱危，赴以剛毅，則一時之遭遇誠有所難言，然悠久之地位或猶得保持；此外各國，利害關係誠非一致，甚至蘊伏彼此異常矛盾之因素於其間；然在此國際大局劇烈變化中之今日，無不設願法國克保越南現狀，抑且無不願爲法國保衛越南之後盾。夫法國處境誠屬千難萬難，然關於越南問題之環境，則魔道惟一而有利之條件居什八九焉。易辭申言之：德義雖戰勝法國，猶未欲視越南爲禁臠而遽攫爲己有；雖抗衡英國，亦未欲視越南爲據點而搖撼其敵人。中國爲抗拒侵略，必竭全力而勿使越南淪於侵略者之手。英國雖熟聞覬覦越南者，以假道侵華爲藉口；然明知如此藉口者•實爲掩護其威脅英屬緬甸馬來之重要布局之烟幕。至於美國，尤瞿然於法國而不克保持越南，則對於菲律賓實爲脣亡而齒寒。如此有利環境之下，法國主政者，應如何洞鑒於目前斷送之必一去不復返，先謀保留之於今日國際劇烈變化之過渡時代，然後圖存之於他日國際總淸算時之折衝？應如何不辭慘痛之脅迫，毅然決然，拒絕一切要挾與要求，恢復越南境內主權行政之完整。夫法國在戰爭之前，權衡利害得失，比較緩急重輕，則外交上自有歧途；在戰爭之日，不遑兼顧，有所趨避，則外交上自有歧途；事已至此，無復歧途！顧乃維希傳來消息、離奇刺謬、備見徬徨。謂猶有所畏懼於覬覦者之脅逼歟？謂猶有所歆動於覬覦者之甘言歟？一似別有高深值得攷慮；此其見地，洵難想像，是亦使吾儕不無迷惑之感者也。此又一事也。意者，國際累積之恩怨，錯綜之利害，歷歲月而疑雲重重；雖至戰爭爆發，初未備最高之自信，未有最大之決心；於是兩軍相對，一面以實逼處此而砲火周旋，一面又別有所期待、別有所醞釀：等而下之，猶望如何因循取巧。不得已而交戰、但各無制勝之把握，乃復多方爭取有利作戰之條件。英德交戰誠壯烈矣，各有所顧慮而避不以主力決雌雄，姑且相數以階段曰一也二也。敎皇悲天憫人，更察人心之微；雖知調解之困難，亦以爲調解之自始並非絕不可能，於是隨時想作調解之嘗試。歐局如彼，影響於法屬越南者，使德國明知無所厚望於遠東方面獲得有效之與國，然爲越南問題而支撑維希政府，遂亦有其必然之限度。即此限度，亦足以使覬覦者之曉然於虛聲不能濟事；越南至今滯留於問題之中，謂非此故歟！</p>

<h3>蘇嘉區華軍　頗為活躍</h3>
<p>據自吳江來滬者談、流動於吳江·靑浦·嘉善一帶之華軍游擊隊陳耀宗部、於最近益見活躍、該團曾於本月五日由第一營夜襲西塘鎭、頗爲得手、曾斃日軍多名、井獲得長槍三枝、　第二營則砲擊同里鎭、該鎭所駐日軍均聞風向吳江一帶退去、本月十一日該團在周莊附近、由團長陳耀宗親率機槍連、至角直·陳墓·同里一帶巡弋、當與該地日軍發生激戰、達四小時之久、日軍不支而退、華軍獲得長槍五枝，機槍一挺、幷擊沉日汽艇二艘、又於本月十三日在蘆壚·北庫一帶、恰遇由黎里開出之日軍汽船一艘、陳　當以一連之衆、與日軍作殊死戰、歷一小時半、是役日軍死傷七八、華軍僅有二名受傷、翌日、有日軍百餘名、分乘汽艇及小型兵艦、至蘆墟·莘塔·金澤一帶、意圖報復、因華軍戒備甚嚴、卒未得逞、</p>

<p>自駐華英大使館公告禁止英倫銀行鈔票　入英國並限八月二十七日午夜以前、交在華銀行或從在華郵局寄出、得在英國收到時、收入該銀行之限、否則、不得在英國收取、我財部爲顧全持有該項鈔票之中外人民利益計、特指定中國銀行分支行、爲收兌英鈔機關、以便彙集運英、惟昨據新聲社記者向英大使館探悉、上項限期、已獲展期二日、卽至八月二十九日午夜以前爲止、是以凡持有英倫銀行鈔票者、務須在限期以前、向中國銀行兌換法幣、並悉二十九日以後、凡前往英國旅行者、仍准携帶十英鎊之英倫鈔票、</p>
<p>照法定價　中行收兌</p>
<p>昨據中國銀行上海分行消息、該行雖未奉到總行之任何通知、收兌英鈔辦法、惟凡國人持有英倫銀行鈔票者、得向該分行兌換法幣、該行以法定價格折合兌換、卽法幣一元作五辨士二五計算、每一英金票折合爲四十五元七角一分（國幣）、至於內地各中國銀行分支行處，確已奉到總行通知、收兌英倫銀行鈔票、</p>

<p>英金鈔爲上海錢兌業同業公會之市塲上外國貨幣買賣之一、每日由市塲公告買進賣出行市、昨日行市賣出爲五十四元、買進爲五十三元五角、明日起、市塲或將停止掛牌英金票行市、其他美金票等則照常、惟各錢兌莊鑒於英大使館之公告、爲禁止英倫鈔票輸入英國、並非絕對禁止行使、所以此後對英金票之買賣、擬視實際情形、再行決定買賣與否、惟價格事實上勢必爲錢兌莊所抑低、</p>
<p>金融市塲　不受影響</p>
<p>錢兌業市塲某君告新聲社記者云、英金票在上海市塲之流通額、爲數不多、若欲買進大批現票、則苦無現貨可交、此次之禁止輸入英國消息傳出後、市塲上擁有英金票者出籠、致謠言　起、各方供給頓旺、而買戶鮮有、價格猛跌、將來之英金票情形、則目前殊難預料、與整個金融市塲、則無關係，至於銀錢業公會會員行莊、向不經營英金票業務、錢兌業公會會員莊、亦不過代容買賣而已，</p>

<p>工部局發言人昨日對於日方報紙謠傳工部局大批職員辭職之消息、加以否認、該發言人稱、工部局並未遭遇職員大規模提出辭呈之事、渠指出工部局職員每年均有若干人提出辭呈、此爲極普通之事、本年辭職之人數、或較以往爲多、此則一部份由於各英籍職員多有志願爲國從軍者、但渠否認多數高級職員之辭職、由於工作條件之不滿所致、</p>

<p>撤退之英軍共爲千七百五十名、連同英軍司令長官暨各長官眷屬、一行不下二千餘名、此行航海安全、當此戰爭期內、自須加以重視、故英當局決增派英國砲艦蟋蟀號等六艘獲航南行、撤退英軍眷屬、由奈康達號逕行載往星加坡安置、其餘各英防軍、目的地不詳、</p>
<p>撤退總額</p>

<p>外滙昨日市况、滙豐掛牌、悉無上落、英美匯暗市、緊風突起、市面受流言影響、人心於恍惚中、作多頭活動、蓋謂越南法當局已允日軍假道攻華、又傳某氏將任財長、或行政院長說、投機商扒結、美金達六十萬元以上、而外銀行吸英金、套出美金、但非貴價不售、致當日呈步緊不回勢、英金由三辨士六八七五、步軟至三辨士六二五、美金由五元五六二五、緊至五元四〇六二五、均以最緊價收市、計英緊〇六二五、美緊一八七五、交易頗盛、</p>

<h3>金述融評（續）</h3>
<p>— 聖凱瓊</p>
<p>——八月二十四日——</p>
<p>最近公債行市以連漲（廿一日以前情形）姿態出現市塲，又有以非常時期管理銀行暫行辦法第一條的準備金來解釋的，大意是續存存款的百分之二十作爲準備金勢在必行，但上海情形特殊，或許以變通辦法，在百分之二十的準備金中搭配若干成的公債，從而說明債市的高翔，殆卽川於金融界的購吸。這一個解釋較之前面一個說素，自然進步。但是要以之視爲推動債市的原動力，却還須加以考慮。我認爲有兩個基本前提必須先要了解：</p>
<p>第一點，管理銀行辦法，（請參閱八月十八日金融述評），是一般性的，要說根據第三條及第四條認爲是着重於上海，不如說着重在自由中國的地域，因爲銀行運用存款底不依照第三，四兩條，並非上海所特有的現象。實際上第四，五兩條很顯明的注重於自由中國。第二點，本法如要施行，必須適合環境地將第六條至第九條加以修改而實行，決不能單獨地實行第二條，管理辦法是一個整個的指導，監督，統制的法規，不容分離買行，一加分離，卽不能收統制之効。認識道兩個前提之後，可知該法在上海實行與否，還是一個未知數。銀行運用資金一定要知道千穏萬妥方始落手，現在還是未知數時，尙談不到收購公債作爲準備金之一部。</p>
<p>那末債市高翔的原因，究竟是什麼呢？一是投機市塲的平穩，二是局勢的推移。以投機市塲中的外滙言，自月初轉緊後，美金在五元半英金在三便士七的水準盤旋，而現貨與九月期行市相差甚微，無利可套，紗花市塲，亦甚不振，故此資金向公債市場上活動，市價如相差一元時卽有百分之一以上的利益，卽至少有月息一分以上的利息，則與其呆在外滙紗花上，自不如向公債活動爲優也，以局勢言，八月以來，美國對日强硬，英日磨擦的展開，越南的緊張，防軍問題，中國局勢，無不有相當的影響。（完）</p>
<h3>舶來品？</h3>
<p>自海上交通的脈絡，被箝制住；歐洲的緊張，洋貨進口的日少。然而上海人士還是迷信着舶來品，做生意的當然投顧客之所好，顧客不辨貨物好歹，但知舶來品便佳，於是上海市塲儘多流行着舶來品，有的標油愛司哀，裝璜來得洋化，定價則照外匯，成本是十足道地在上海製造的成本，顧客們捧之卽走，誰知道是變相的舶來品呢！吾且舉一個例來說罷！某工廠新近接得筆洋行交易，定製寫字檯上用的「綠呢玻璃版」四角的白鋼條片，須標明是某外國製造的，轉　由居間人媒介接洽，第一個居間人向廠方談生意經，從兩元一尺的定製價碼，减到每尺一元五角，而第一居間人的佣金（康密興），居然要加到一元五角，這樣定價就一變而爲三元一尺了。不料第二居間人（第一居間人接受委託的定貨者）也要求在造價中，再加上一元的康密興，又從三元一尺。一變而爲四元一尺了。洋行再加上極大的利潤，混充他是進口舶來品，將定價改作外幣，賣給不辨中西的中國人，買的人還是津津樂道說是西洋貨呢！你想寃也不寃。要知冒充外國貨，以欺中國人，正不知有多少，此尤其小焉者也。（島客）</p>
<h3>證券　謠言又起　公債欲漲忽止</h3>
<p>證券暗盤、昨日市况、因今日爲孔子聖誕停市關係、昨市祇做上午半日交易、市面比較稍堅、惟未見踴躍、乙丁兩種均未有成交、市面因防區問題、又另生枝節、尙未解決、同時謠言　起、債市因此未能暢達、前途變化尙多、殊不易推測也、昨日交易、以信昌聯益及恒孚稍有進胃、零星散戶略有補空、同興號先入後出、樂茂賣出較多、大通亦有斬多、午後辦理交割停市、市價結果略好一二角、半日交易成交四十萬元左右、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>股票交易、成交交通銀行股一百股、價爲六十元零五角、</p>
<p>又衆業公所昨日股市開盤、買方勢力比較脆弱、蓋上星期之隔夜多頭太多、致高價有人賣出、但不久形勢突變、多方乘低又來加碼、市况復轉挺昂、下午初因謠傳港地日僑撤退、價格一度又見低落、但瞬卽回上、銀根之鬆、潛勢之堅、無從否認、昨日成交極鉅、實業股與橡皮股、榮辱互見、初不限於一二種特殊類目、</p>
<h3>紗花　存紗已近卅萬　投機興奮反濃</h3>
<p>紗市續堅、且漲風蛟烈、此因市塲流言　起、謂英金鎊停止使用後、將利於棉紗多頭、人心激動、掀起買風、投機者興奮性愈濃、互相購進、一時籌碼稍感枯弱、乃抬力尤强也、不過香港方面需要較爲活動些、但空方議論、本埠各倉庫之存紗、逐步增加、已近三十萬包、港海航運已告中斷、而多方說此貨皆在囤戶手中、一時決不吐出來、所以與大局恐無關係云、</p>
<p>現紗晨開、人氣即良好、塲中搶帽子之戶、大都傾向購進、二十支雙馬開爲九百五十元、漲七八元、旋後在九百五十四元之間進退甚久、豈料至十一時左右、利多謠言紛紛、買風陡起、須臾間忽見在跳、由九百六十元直至九百七十元而至八十元、後以獲利者吐出、回小至九百七十三元、今日爲孔誕、市塲停市、散空非軋直不可、以免風險也、查半日間成交統計二千二百六十包、行情二十支雙馬漲三十元、今日有棉紗八十五件運烟台、一百三十五件運香港、茲將各幫買去之額量分別如左、</p>
<p>香港六〇〇同行一、六四〇六溫州一〇</p>
<p>厦門五〇統計二、二六〇</p>
<h3>棉花買賣　稍見熱鬧</h3>
<p>現棉交易、稍見開展、廠方舉動仍靜默、同行互相買賣又見熱烈、此因紗價上昂之故、投機生意隨之興盛矣、</p>
<p>通州　一七一·〇　三一進　一五〇包</p>
<p>上餘　一八八·〇　元誠進　二五〇包</p>
<p>惠司登　二〇八·〇　慶盛進　二〇〇件</p>
<p>火草包　一五二·五　振大進　二七七包</p>
<p>彭家浦　二〇六·〇　大德進　一〇〇件</p>
<p>如草包　一五五·〇　三一進　二〇〇包</p>
<p>白洛去　二〇〇·〇　永理進　一〇〇件</p>
<p>南宮　一五八·〇　德豐厚　一〇〇件</p>
<p>另訊外棉市價、紐約棉市、晨初市况卽呈活躍之狀、後因現貨商及同業之購買、結果收盤價格、較之上日漲、一三磅音、印度連同預測跌一羅比、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、昨日先因匯兌之轉緊，後日方廠商在市購買現貨頗烈、奈因市上存底不豐、祇有千餘件之成交額、一般預料、按照今日之交易趨勢、開關後、棉價將繼續步漲也、</p>
<h3>糧食　崑山新尖　昨有上市　洋米一漲又回落</h3>
<p>洋米昨市因傳說甬滬交通將恢復而南洋問題又多謠言、且前日適値星期例假、故昨日需要倍增、不獨內地帮乘廉搜辦本鄉店戶納胃亦濃、大局頓呈活躍、一時各貨行情卽升半元光景、若一號陳西貢竟喊至六十元火絞五十九元、二號西貢五十四元半、小絞五十四元、原包英華司暹邏二號轉銀行棧貨開至六十四元半、又二號西貢自六十二元八角大至六十三元一角、旋以甬帮等定米又有到申、本街等實銷、並未繼起、浮戶更紛紛獲利出籠、供過於求、乃告回跌、結果各價雖尙有增高二三角者、但可稱定局、計一號陳西貢爲五十九元、二號五十三元半、五十三元、一號暹邏五十九元、五十八元半、二號五十二元七角、五十二元三角、火絞五十八元、香港尖五十七元半、五十六元、中五十五元、次五十二元半、五十二元、小絞尖五十三元三角、五十三元、東京砶尖特自五十元、次之四十八元、糙尖四十七八元、碎尖四十三四元、米茶四十五六元、全日現米成交七千包原包則有二百噸左右、</p>
<p>洋米昨日又有少數到滬、計五百十九包、係怡和洋行明生輪、自香港裝來、前日（二十五）傍晚抵埠、停靠羅斯福碼頭起卸、</p>
<p>粳糯國米兩朝共到七八百包、而明暗市交易、傳聞早市洋米奔騰時、相隨並提、惟後亦稍回、不過以到貨有限、貨主扳持極力、不肯放鬆、結果售價較週前尙提半元左右、常帮鮮淸粳六十七八元、無錫淸粳六十六元左右、常州蘇崑粳高自六十五六元、次至六十一二元、薄稻宿六十二元半、南港原包早稻六十三元半、六十三元、斛見六十二元半至六十元零五角、糯米溧金特元六十二元左右、常丹白元六十元零五角至五十九元、香港特元六十二元、六十一元半、普通六十元五十九元、砶元五十四五元、</p>
<p>周浦新粳到祗三四十担、銷塲頗佳、價增半元、開開六十二元半、六十二元、崑山新羊尖亦已上市、數計十八担、由正大廠碾白出售、米品美妙、多所歡迎一霎卽、罄價開斛見六十元、</p>
<h3>洋麥湧到後　福新開車應市</h3>
<p>麵粉　昨日粉市大致平疲、蓋自上週洋粉及洋麥運到後、人心不免鬆濫、而本廠粉在月餅汛中、銷塲尙不寂寞，福新廠以洋麥有到、聞已開車供應、統市華廠批出數量、約計五千包、洋粉新到者尙無兜售、內地粉亦鮮動態、惟日廠粉綠鳳凰牌期貨十月份開出六七千包、價爲十四元九角、與上週末相埒、本月份未有正市、現貨價售十四元六角、市面已轉進色也、</p>
<p>小麥　昨日新小麥交易仍鮮開展、因華日粉廠均有洋麥運到、對於原料雖有需用、而吃盤不肯寬放、行團心思尙穩、並無亟脫之意、故市面漲跌兩難、華廠祇收進數十包與一二百包之小數、日廠亦僅收二三千包、扯價已暗小三五角不等、</p>
<h3>油餅　生油再漲</h3>
<p>花生油市面自上週六轉機後、昨市在人心樂觀狀態下、再砌元譜、總之處境特殊、投機風難壓制故市面之起伏、大都越出正軌、昨現生油祇成交膠州油五十件、（價爲六十三元）、訂期交易則熱鬧異常、共成一千七百餘件、計九月下半月內交五百件、（價爲六十元至六十一元）十月上半月內交一千三百餘件、（價爲六十一元）靑島現生油成交二十桶、價爲八十九元至八十九元五角、路貨做開五十桶、價爲八十八元、豆油在被動地位、趨勢平定、計開大連油四十桶、價爲九十七元至九十七元五角、大有廠油都是皮球生意、計開二百五十担、價爲七十五元新棧單、七十四元爲老棧單、及浦東廠油二十桶、價爲七十五元五角云、（今爲孔子誕辰、照例休市一天、）昨有豆油三百聽由靑島運來、今日有芝蔴一百四十三包、生油五百九十聽均運香港、</p>
<h3>糖市　糖價上落無多</h3>
<p>昨粗白據產電稍見鬆跌、荷蘭電爲一〇·三七五、一〇·二五、一〇·一二五、香港電爲二四·五〇至二四·〇〇、公會劃盤尙屬穩定、現貨二四粗白本棧新貨七十四元二角、無更動、老貨七十三元半、升五角、轉口貨亦見緊、九月六日交割爲六十元、荷棉白TML嘜七十三元、荷赤　嘜本棧貨六十四元、現貨六十三元半、途貨九月六日可到者六十一元半、太古車白較軟、L嘜七十四元、小三角、HX嘜仍六十九元半、國糖有建帮開出刁靑三百餘包、價爲六十四元、餘乏成交、</p>
<h3>絲茶　土荘紅茶外銷略活</h3>
<p>昨日綠茶銷路、因地中海戰事方殷摩洛哥銷塲阻滯、仍無重大發展之望、僅土莊紅茶怡和錦隆好士鬥等行、均起動辦、市　視前略見活潑、昨共成交六百餘箱、售價自二百二十元至二百八十五元、鳳眉珠茶等項、美莊雖有零星談判、但未有成交、市情殊爲黯淡云、</p>
<h3>疋頭　囤戶復活　布價突昂</h3>
<p>國布　昨布市激漲、蓋浙閩復航、希望益濃、而紗市頻昂、人心頗受激刺、同業補空及業內外囤戶又來拖進、本街染坯布吸胃突增、故售盤節節上漲、結果白貨漂染布均漲每疋二角半至七角半、本街成交各貨一千餘件、浙閩幫除報裝原定各貨外、新生意尙少成訂、粵港幫辦斜紋色布一百數十件、北路烟津幫辦進二百數十件、南洋新加坡等地辦色布色斜等五千餘疋、今有疋頭二百十五件運烟台、一百七十八件運香港、</p>
<p>東布　昨以各方消息利於多頭、本街同業及囤戶進胃益旺、白貨龍頭細布上午收盤三十二元六角半、下午繼續升騰、漲至三十二元二角、四君子嗶嘰最高盤售開九角四分半、收盤時稍挫、爲九角四分三七五、中檔細布續漲、每疋七角半至一元、形勢殊堅、</p>

<p>舊報新抄　六十七年前（四八八）　（見遜淸同治十二年本報）縣令自戕　　數日前嘉定縣境出有逆倫案件，縣令以治民無方，愁急自戕，茲錄其群情如次：初，嘉定縣知縣缺，江西程序東明府其珏實補授之，既而調簾以去，奉檄署篆者爲劉卯生明府履芬。明府雖由納粟進，而文名甚著，省中月課，屢列前茅，上游頗器其爲人，委署疁篆，三月以來，亦堪勝任，而鄉間忽以姪殺伯之獄，里甲來報，飭俟明晨詣騐，至晚仍冠帶昇堂，提各他案訊鞠，三鼓時，退入靜室，屛從者，而自廣其門，人亦不以爲意也。繼而有大聲疾呼者，其僕疑而窺之，寂無聲息，叩其門不應，集衆破扉入，則見明府衣冠濟楚，長跪於地，右手持小剪一具，血濡縷自喉間出，撫之已冰。急報丞尉，咸茫無所措，質明申文太倉州牧，請委鄰封來騐，其家屬聞訊，亦由省馳來，刻聞未奉騐明，尙難入殮。談靑烏之術者，謂嘉定縣署，不利於官，近年來，或以病歿，或以憂去，或妻子死亡，或官秩罣悮，今劉明府竟因逆倫案自戕而死，人莫不憐其遇之蹇而益咎乎署之凶也。　　明日刊登　　信局新章申報船期表　　今日到埠者　　柯立芝總統　舊金山　美國　　歐洲郵船　泗水　渣華　　定期到埠者　　歐洲郵船　　香港小呂宋　　批亞士總統　八月卅一日　美國　　柯立芝總統　九月九日　美國　　太平洋郵船　　舊金山　　柯立芝總統　八月廿七日　美國　　世界班　　　克總統　九月廿四日　美國　　今日出口者　　　立遜總統　漢呂　美國　　定期出口者　　歐洲郵船　　香港小呂宋船郵　　柯立芝總統　八月廿八日　美國　　太平洋郵船　　洛杉磯　　（神戶海濱檀香山舊金山）　　批亞士總統　九月一日　美國　　柯立芝總統　九月十日　美國　　世界班　　哈立遜總統　八月十五日　美國　　南洋北班　　南華班　　北洋班　　寧波班　　內河班　　嘉興硤石班　　利濟　每隔四日在天后宮橋開　　平湖金山班　　利濟　每隔四日在天后宮橋開　　閔行　三四號洋橋班　　利濟　每日對開船泊天后宮橋開　　南橋班　　天成　每日晨五時外灘碼頭　　大團新場　　　天成　每日晨七時停泊天后宮橋　　蘇州無錫常州　　天成　十六日船舶天后宮橋　　蘆墟黎里市湖州班　　海隆　三十日　船舶南南蘇州</p>

<p>自由談	雜感敎師的責任  金光　　敎師的一張嘴巴，對於可塑性最高的中小學生，簡直是一根魔笛。敎師吹到東，學生就跟到東，敎師吹到西，學生就跟到西。學生對於敎師的話，簡直當聖旨一樣看待。　　在小學的時候，聽見敎師說到中國蘊藏的豐富，就覺得非立志做開礦的工程師不足以救國；後來從敎師那裏知道中國幅員的廣大和鐵路綫的稀少，就改變了主意，以爲應該改做鐵路工程師才行；最後看見了中國科學的落後，經過敎師吹了幾句，又想讀物理化學去了。我知道有許多人是在中小學時代決定了終身事業的方向的，而其決定的標準，又往往是敎師的三言兩語。　　可見敎師的責任是非同小可的。　　中國人對於不好的敎師的形容詞是「誤人子弟」，而這『人』字往往楚指『人家』和『別人』，所包括的是一種狹窄的家族觀念。其實在今日我們不應該再這樣看了。今日的敎師所誤的不僅是別人的一家一族的子弟，而是自己的國家的子弟，是社會的子弟。　　所以今日做敎師者的責任是更其重大的。敎育謹向上海學校當局陳述幾點管見  岳高　　日子過得眞快，從去年部令改訂了敎師節日，今天又是一年一度的敎師節了。日子一天天苦苦地挨過，上海的環境似乎那麽容易地也一天天越發不堪下去。是的，在我們敎育園地的裏裏外外充溢着迫害和窒息，三年來學校當局們苦心的應付，的確是够苦的。然而我們一向念到本身肩負的使命，民族國家託付給我們的責任，我們既不敢說我們在現狀下已盡了最大的任務，實在有許多地方既做得不够，而且有些戰慄於在無意中或多或少地不利了我們國家和民族！我們中間有許多並不曾接受了民族的託付，好好地培植下一代，甚至有的竟收取了家長們的汗血，却沒有償還他們殷殷地期望着敎養他們子弟的願望！趁這一年一度的節日，我願大家作一番回憶，深自省察！　　現在上海的環境也許要更壞下去，那自然還得學校當局們更艱苦地應付。不過有許多事務和設施，是關於學校本身的，比如招收新生，似乎有許多學校是採取了越多越好的態度，並沒有學額的規定，並不注意考試的成績，凡考必取，於是發生了學生的成績一年年下降的趨勢！一個學生要是平日對功課並不注意，考試不及格，要留級了，他換一個學校，就可升級：下一年要是再如此，於是再換一個學校，又可升級；於是他在這幾次的換校以後，竟畢了業。於是有許多學校留級生沒有了。可是一學期開始，一級中學生的成績，竟有差了二三年的。這是一。二，學校爲了增加收入起見，每班學生幾至無限止地儘數加增，擠得課室中一無空隙連敎師走幾步的地位也沒有，不要說跑到後排同學那里去指導一下，或是視察一下了；甚至一級多至九十餘人，上課的效果如何，大概富局們也很明白，可是並不改進。三，說到敎師們的待遇，上海生活程度這麽高，菲薄的敎薪無法應付是誰也知道的，那末，要是當局的收入並不少的話，我希望敎薪也能提高些。末了，我更希望學校當局對學生們的態度以及師生間的連繫該深深地注意，如其學生們有什麼學術上的組織，當局不但不應該去阻礙他們，而且應該盡量滿足他們的要求，正確地指導他們，啟發他們，使他們對學術上的硏究感到興趣，認識他們自己的地位，幫助他們解決問題，務使敎師與學生與學校在學業上情感上融和起來，密切起來；這樣，自然而然地，學生們就會全力地來愛護他們的學校。學校也就得自然地蓬勃地發展了。　　上海環境雖壞，然而許多事我們還可以做，何况我們更肩負着社會國家付予我們的使命。職業敎師經驗談  朱晸暘　　在二十年的敎育生涯中，門弟子怕也不下三千吧。有的也已經桃李門牆，有的則已獲得了專門知識，從外國回來；當然也有的窮愁潦倒，寄人爲活；也有的兒女繞膝，專做着賢妻良母。但是，在孔聖人面前，又那敢吹牛，又那敢曉舌？還是說一些做敎師的經騐罷　　自己學習——敎師未見得件件都能，事事都曉，但又不能對學生說一個不知道」。所以在二十年的從敎生涯中，最多的時間是在自己學習。在課前，在課後把學生所要知道所應該知道的問題，自己先弄淸楚了，然後登臺。那種一拿起書本就進課堂的老敎師架子，我是不敢領敎的。所以在敎師生涯中，所學到的，我覺得比學生時代要多好幾倍。所謂敎學相長　，眞是至理名言。　　上台師生下台友——「師道尊嚴」，不錯，但這決不是擺起了閻王面孔使學生怕懼，而是要學生從心的敬愛你。譬如，你知道得比他們多，你自己也非常好學，跟著時代走，造成一種好學的空氣。你對於他的生活，非常了解，不但敎他書，還指導他的生活，這樣，學生自然會尊敬你。因此，我與學生間的關係，是「上台師生下台友」，在課外的時間，就與他們一起玩耍，一起閑談，把他們看作朋友似的，這樣，彼此更易了解，彼此更易接近，而且更容易收效。我的學生，據說沒有一個人不懼怕我，連眼睛對他們看一看也都是怕的，但却沒有一個人不是找的好朋友。　　不做包辦敎師——有的敎師口才好，一敎書便滔滔不絕的從頭講到底，但洗耳恭聽的學生有幾個呢？在我的班上，決計不容許有白聽講的學生，至少要他們用用腦子，答答問話，有的時候還要他們動動手的做做筋肉練習，變換變換空氣。有些知識，非得要他們自己去發掘不可！儘督讓別人批評，我花頭多，只要于學生有益，於敎育合理，我們爲什麽要做出力不討好的包辦敎師呢？霍桑探案　舞后的歸宿  程小青著　　第六章　危險的經歷　　我暗忖他當眞是個智識份子，顯然瞭解到法律的順序。可是一個智識靑年，竟墮落到這般地步，不能不鈎起我一種不可名狀的嘅嘆。　　倪金壽答道：「拘票？還沒有。此刻還在偵查時期，請你到警廳裏去問幾句話。」　　他冷笑似地說：「請我？用手槍請？」　　倪金壽說：「這是自衛。你袋裏搜出來的什麽東西？」他把左手在自己的玄色細呢夾袍子的衣袋外面拍了一拍。「快走罷。」　　他又沉吟了一下，便點點頭，向着那輛停着的汽車走去。那汽車門本沒有關，倪金壽搶在他前面，先走上車去。我跟在余甘棠後面。他在車廂中的座位，就隔在我們倆的中間。汽車開動以後，我們三個人都保持靜默。過了兩三分鐘，他似乎經過了容愼的考慮，才搆成了一句簡短的問句。　　「你們憑着什麽處分拘我？」　　倪金壽似乎不願在車廂中作答，等了一等，才同樣簡短地回答。「你自己幹的什麼事，你總知道。」　　余甘棠不再回答，但他的眼睛凝視着前面司機人的背，好像在竭力思索。我坐在他貼身，覺得那髮膏的香味和汗臭交雜的氣息，刺鼻難受。我暗忖他雖是個大學生，在一般人看來，他是個智識分子，也是個未來的社會領袖。但他的精神時間，既然大部份消耗在化裝科，跳舞科，和異性交際科上，他的成績一定也可想而知。那末這樣的靑年，當眞可以做社會的領導者嗎？唉，（八八）隨筆為人師表  凱仁　　三年來的戰爭，中國的各方面都在不斷的迅速的進步中，可是敎育界進步的却緩慢，甚至退步，這不可否認是敎育界的恥辱，這恥辱不該將牠隱沒起來，作爲家醜不可外揚，相互的，應該敎育界同人，積極的努力來洗刷。　　今年的敎師節來了！牠有特殊的意義，牠不僅是給敎師們一日的休假，而是帶來反省的機會！三年多的抗戰。敎師們有些什麽貢獻？（自然我並不否認有許多敎師在不斷的努力中）不少的人由於精神的苦悶，生活的壓迫，走向歧途，出入賭窟，跑狗塲，吃酒，　麻將，甚至吸鴉片。在課室裏是堂皇「爲人師長」，回到家裏又是另一種人格，對敎師本身說這是墮落，對學生方面，這些沒有敎師人格的人根本不配爲人師長。敎師不但毀了自已，還毀了無數的赤心的靑年，於心何忍？另有一部份敎師，自己不走正路，還忌妒別人，因之會產生兩種後果：一是他使平時努力認眞敎書的朋友也走向歧途，一是他對別人挑撥，攻擊，毀謗，使得好敎師無法存身，除非你隨同濁流。在這種情况下，敎師不但要自身進步，還得同化他人。　　在這里提供大家一點意見，敎師們應該是「爲人師表」的，我們一定要做到給學生作榜樣：　　（一）在消極方面—不作無意識的消遣，不言行不符，不出入墮落的塲所，不誤人子弟，不忌妒他人，不作對大衆有害的事，不自私，不阻碍他人的進步。　　（二）在積極方面—要培植靑年學生，指示他們正確的方向，敎書要認眞負責任，不要只顧自己愜意而不顧學生，要看些有用的書籍，以便添增敎材，也可以介紹給學生，這對於兩方面都有好處，還可以將書上的問題提出和同事們討論，閒談，大家交換意見，得到正確的結論。緊在集體生活中學習，多做有利心身的活動。</p>

<p>㳺藝界戲詞錯誤談  君美　　（一）　　近年以來，平劇於音韻·樂器·置景·行頭等等，頗事改進，雖見仁見智，毀譽參半，而有意訂正革新，要亦未可厚非，獨於唱詞則鮮有注意及之者，蓋伶人積習，墨守宗派，卽或明知其錯誤，亦雅不欲自我糾正，於是嬗遞而傳，恍若鐵案，有「錯到底」之概矣！　　（二）　　戲詞錯誤，不外乎脫略倒置，含糊謬誤，雖影響於全劇者殊渺，而一言一語，亦往往使人茫然不得其解者，卽如空城計「論陰陽如反掌保定乾坤」，與「東西征南北剿博古通今」二句，其每句末四字，與全句意義，頗不聯貫，其誤蓋由於倒置之故，若易以「論陰陽如反掌博古通今」，「東西征南北剿保定乾坤」，則詞意前後通順，夫亦人而知之矣。乃獨以爲此劇係譚氏傑作，老譚如此唱，無論其爲宗譚與吾，未嘗敢擅易一字！又如賣馬秦　唱「駡聲秦瓊瞎了眼，拿着響馬當賓朋，拉着店東撒個懶，如此你我兩丟開」，四句搖板，眼朋懶開三易其轍，前人亦頗有言之者矣，顧唱者不以爲忤！實則老譚劇藝，硏究極精，此等錯誤，決不致疏忽若此，據老單云：老譚喜故弄狡獪，使學之者不易捉摸，則安知老譚當日，不偶爾有意顚之倒之哉？此其蹈襲前人錯誤，可笑甚矣！　　（三）　　至於唱詞之不能與劇情吻合者，則一語之誤，往往意義全非，白良關尉遲恭明明紮黑靠，戴黑盔，而小黑唱「後面又來一豪家，無有盔來無有甲，皂羅袍上繡團花」，使觀者對之，咸有莫名其妙之感，實則考其原詞，則「烏油盔來烏油甲，皂油袍上繡團花」，與劇情初無矛盾。又嘗見某名伶唱一捧雪，莫成唱「在一傍哭壞了雪氏夫人」，夫雪艷之爲夫人與吾，姑不置論，雪艷之不姓雪，不能稱之爲雪氏，則彰彰明甚，而唱者自唱，聽者自聽，未嘗有間言，亦異事也！　　（四）　　至劇詞謬誤至使人無從索解者，則無過於八大錘，陸文龍出塲引子曰：「席略命元堯辜負幾時飄」。坐塲詩曰：「一杳丹靑綠，空山水木飄，長江波浪湧，海水似湧潮」。其支離割裂，卽欲加以牽强潤飾，亦有無從着筆之概，雖間有改念他詞，而對此則初亦未嘗有人加以注意也。　　（五）　　劇詞錯誤，類乎上述者不勝枚舉，梅畹華唱玉堂春，將「奴與他露水夫妻有甚麼的情」一語，改唱「他與我露水夫妻有甚麼的情」，識者謂爲點鐵成金，蓋示蘇三之一往情深，頗願伶人亟起圖之。「夜上海」短評  病鳩　　「夜上海」是一部富於現實性的劇本，故事發生於三年前的上海，正是「八一三」浩刦後的糜爛都市生活的反映，這裏有現社會的善與惡，愛與佾，有在笑也有痛哭，利用着那尖銳的現實的觀察來搬演，和蘊有暗示力抒情味的親切情感來强調，因此演出的效果是相當的有力和生動。總之，在此時此地演此劇，多少總給觀衆們點刺激。有人說：于伶現實性的作風是他劇作的精髓，這或許還沒有看到他的另一方面。　　「夜上海」的發表本是五幕劇，第一幕的標題是「何處桃源」，第二幕「刦後灰」，第三幕「歸去也」，第四幕「茫茫夜」，第五幕「星移斗轉」，因爲環境和時間的關係，經過一度的刪改，第一幕略去，第二三幕也有不少改動的地方，題材的原素提供得太多，因此缺少了戲劇性的高潮，故事的開展和結束，都在平淡中過去，當然，我們原諒劇作者的苦心，上海之大，無奇不有，要憑一個人的鑒別力去搜集和取捨，確是相當困難。　　這次劇藝社的演出，角色的支配，和去年初决公演時沒有多大更易，人才相當整齊，柏李的梅　輝，是這個劇本的主要人物，也是最成功的一個。募輝是個富於理智和熱情的姑娘，有冷靜的頭腦，堅强的意志，豐富的學識，柏李雖沒有憑着竭力的烘托，却在不知不覺中，反映出她顯明的個性。最後，她有這麽幾句：「夫婦關係，應該建築在雙方的愛情上面，才是幸福的。」這正是她的人生觀的基本認識和抱負。徐立的錢愷之不是個容易搬演的角色，他是個忠實幹練的靑年却沒有堅毅的意志，他苦悶，憂鬱，而沒有能力來目拔，他確有乘人之危，誘人之女的意念，可是他不願意被人發覺。此種現社會的典型人物，可以發現在上海社會的每個角落裏。藍蘭的吳姬，適合她的演技，十分成功，胡導的孫煥君，雖說過火了些，却相當努力，蘇丹，的梅嶺春也稱職　　最後我們得提一提導演朱端鈞的處理塲子的手腕，一部題材複雜的劇本，每幕都能抓住觀衆緊張的情緒，灌注着沈痛的語調，從哭聲中迸發出來，這是値得稱頌的。中國影星水滸人物選　（二）  倪長民　　神醫安道全　（王桂林）　　鼓上蚤時遷　（韓蘭根）　　笑面虎朱富　（尤光照）白楊的行蹤　又有返滬說  海星　　白楊高占非來滬消息，傳之已久，但無下文，茲據香港傳來相當可靠消息稱：白楊施超顧而已魏鶴齡有離渝可能，或者卽行返滬，是否四人同時加入一家公司，則不能預料耳。我對於梅熹的印象  昭　　梅熹我雖然和他同學半年，但是他給予我的印象却很深。他具有最標準的身體和豐富的學識，他喜歡沉思默想，不願多說話，所以不知道他性情的人，輒以爲他很自傲的，但他始終是謙虛不過呢。　　他除拍戱和專心研治法學外，又富實際體味劇本中各個人物，記得上英文戲劇課，講到「少奶奶的扇子」，敎授是個在靑年時失戀而熱情的人，於是觸景生情，把對白一句句講得聲色俱厲；使全堂男女同學失聲大笑，但梅同學却翹着腿，大搖特搖起來，竟把前排同學的屁股踢痛了也沒有知道。　　他平時很忙碌，每日工作在十一小時以上，除從業電影外，不久將掛牌爲律師，好多同學和他打趣，要聘他爲戀愛法律顧問，他只是笑而不答。　　他也歡喜玩球，籃球很有心得，是溪良隊的基本隊員，因爲事務關係，因此不常出席，所以很多人不能看到他的球藝。　　我自己不常看中國影片，所以梅同學的演技如何，我不得而知，不過他的智德體三育，却是値得爲我們同學所敬慕。影人軼事  鏞　　性惑明星梅蕙絲，未與派拉蒙訂立合同前，有三家影片公司一度曾認爲她是不可造就的人才而加以藐視。　　洛勃脫蒙高茂萊，曾在米高梅所拍的第一張影片中唱了一支歌曲，曲名：「到家裏去告訴你的媽媽」，嗣後銀幕上就不能冉見到她的唱歌塲曲。　　卡通鼻祖華德狄斯耐，當未成名前，有一次，親自拿了一部米老鼠短片跑到紐約；可是結果該地的影商竟一致拒絕上映。　　斐爾滋在默片時代一度曾引退銀幕生涯，，後來，有盤影片繼起，他又再度加入影壇工作。　　武俠明星李却迪克斯，原名爲李却·歐斯脫·勃萊茂。在許多年前，有一回卓別麟說他是缺乏做影星的條件，以致他就改成今名。　　克拉克蓋博爾早年時代也在華納影片公司拍過幾部影片，片中所演的都是决要的角色。其時，華納當局亦未加以提拔。　　雷密倫現在是好萊塢影壇上的紅小生了。最近，他告訴人家說：「我能够跨入這座藝術之宮，曾經過了三次的失敗」。　　泰隆鮑華，最初入影圈工作的時候，不過是一個臨時演員，每週的薪金僅祇三十金鎊。棋苑  莆田連學正編　　第一九九局　根深蒂固　李兆精擬　　紅　　先　　和　　自絕前途着法（紅先勝）　　馬四退二　馬九退八　卒三進一　將六退一　卒三進一　　將六進一　馬七進六　車三平四　砲七進七　車三進二　　車五平四　士五退六　車六平四　馬八進六　砲九平四（勝）</p>

<h3>British Air Force Retaliates Against Germany: First Attack on the Berlin Area; British Planes Drop Bombs in the Northern Suburbs of Berlin at Night; German Planes Bombard Various Parts of England Again Yesterday</h3>
<p>Berlin – This morning, the Royal Air Force carried out a retaliatory attack on Germany, flying in formation to bomb Berlin and other cities. Explosions were heard everywhere in the Berlin area, and anti-aircraft guns in various towns returned fire simultaneously. Some saw two British planes flying from the darkness over government buildings, dropping bombs. At 1:10 AM this morning (8:10 AM Shanghai summer time), the anti-aircraft fire became denser, and explosions sounded on all sides. At the same time, stray bullets from the northwest streaked across the sky, indicating that German fighter planes had taken off to intercept the Royal Air Force. At 1:15 AM, anti-aircraft fire was fired directly from beside the Associated Press building, and then anti-aircraft fire rose from all sides. Interspersed with the sound of anti-aircraft guns were occasional huge explosions, likely from British bombs hitting the ground. When the first air raid alarm was issued at 12:25 AM, all residents of the city rushed to air raid shelters to hide. This was the fifth air raid alarm issued in Berlin, but this air raid was the first attack on Berlin by British planes. At the time this article was being written, the air raid was still continuing. (United Press dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden – A Nychter reporter in Berlin reports that ten minutes after the air raid alarm sounded in Berlin last night, a major explosion was heard. Residents took refuge in air raid shelters from midnight until the all-clear signal was given at 1:30 AM, when they came out. The dispatch did not mention any damage or casualties. (Reuters dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>Berlin – An air raid alarm was issued in Berlin this morning, lasting for three hours. The alarm was issued at 0:20 AM this morning and was lifted at 3:25 AM. At that time, anti-aircraft guns around Berlin fired many rounds. It has now been learned that enemy planes only dropped one incendiary bomb in the Rosenthal area in the northern suburbs of Berlin. One gardener's house was hit and caught fire. Enemy planes also dropped leaflets in northern Berlin. (Haitong dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>London – This morning, suddenly one enemy plane appeared in the skies over the London area, dropping three bombs, then rising high into the clouds and disappearing to the northeast. All three bombs were designed to make noise, and the sounds varied in intensity. No air raid alarm was issued at the time. It is now believed that the plane was shot down. Two policemen were killed by the bombing, and one bomb landed on the main gas pipeline of a certain street, causing a fire. (Reuters dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>London – This morning, several large squadrons of German planes again heavily bombed London under cover of darkness. At the same time, long-range artillery of large caliber from the German side also bombarded the Dover area. Although several hundred German planes encountered fierce resistance from British planes and British anti-aircraft batteries, they still managed to break into the skies over London shortly after midnight. The huge British searchlights on the western outskirts of London immediately searched for German planes in the air, and British heavy anti-aircraft batteries also began to roar. Explosions and flashes of fire could be seen in both the western and southern suburbs. The all-clear signal was not given until half an hour later. At the same time, news came from Dover that people had seen searchlights being fired into the sky from the German side across the coast as soon as the German artillery fired, indicating that British planes were also bombing there. The air raids on both sides began after dusk yesterday, so the daytime was relatively quiet. British squadrons encountered suddenly arriving large squadrons of German planes and drove many of them away. (International News Service dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>London – Last night and this morning, squadrons of German planes again attacked the bomb-scarred London area. This morning's air raid was the fifth time in 48 hours that German planes have attacked this city of eight million residents. At 12:30 AM (8:30 AM Shanghai summer time), they flew over the Dover coast. This air raid lasted for 20 minutes. The strange sounds emitted by the "strange noise bombs" were so loud that they were heard throughout Greater London. During the air raid that began at 10:30 PM last night, bombs fell in several locations in the city. The extent of the damage, the number of deaths and injuries, is difficult to ascertain at this time. Shortly after the air raid siren sounded, passersby heard the rumbling sound of anti-aircraft guns, and searchlights began to flash into the sky. The sound of German planes flying could also be heard. However, the bombs dropped in this air raid all fell on the outskirts of the capital. The all-clear was given at 11:20 PM. (United Press dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>London – An explosion occurred yesterday in a certain place on the southeastern coast of England, the sound of which was heard for miles. It is said to have been caused by a mine explosion. Lord Knutsford and his sister, Mrs. Williams, were killed in the explosion. Lady Knutsford was also seriously injured. (Reuters dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>More German Planes Shot Down</p>
<p>London – On Sunday, German planes were less active. It was reported that one person was killed in the Scilly Isles after being bombed in the afternoon. Bombs were also dropped on South Wales, but there was no material damage, and only one person was seriously injured. One enemy bomber in the area was shot down by British fighter planes. Later, enemy planes attempted to cross the Dorset coast but were repelled and did not drop any bombs. (Reuters dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>London – The authorities issued a communique at 9:30 PM last night (6:30 AM Shanghai time today) stating that German planes were less active over England on Sunday than on Saturday. The British Air Force and anti-aircraft guns shot down a total of 39 enemy planes. At the same time, it was confirmed that another five German planes were destroyed on Saturday, so a total of 50 enemy planes were lost on Saturday. During the air battles yesterday, the British Air Force lost 11 planes, and the pilots of three of them were unharmed. It is now known that 12 crew members were rescued from the 19 British planes lost on Saturday. Last night, London issued its fourth air raid alarm of the day. The buzzing sound of planes could be heard in the suburbs, and searchlights illuminated the sky. People on the roads heard the sound of artillery fire. A terrible air battle occurred over the Dorset coast yesterday afternoon, resulting in 40 German bombers and fighter planes being routed. Three of them crashed on land. Spectators on the coastal cliffs said they witnessed three other German planes crashing into the sea. Four German crew members parachuted to land and were captured. In another air battle off the southwest coast in the afternoon, three German fighter planes were shot down, and several others were believed to have crashed into the sea. Later, another German plane crashed in flames. High in the clouds over a town on the southeast coast, a Spitfire British fighter plane engaged a Messerschmitt German plane. Within minutes, the German plane caught fire and plunged straight down. When it was recovered, the pilot was dead. Moments later, another German plane crashed about 12 miles away. (Reuters dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>London – It has now been ascertained that 48 enemy planes that attacked England yesterday were shot down by British fighter planes, and six were shot down by anti-aircraft guns, for a total of 54. The British side lost 13 fighter planes. Three pilots parachuted to safety. Last night, enemy planes bombed areas across southern England and the Midlands. Bombs also fell in several places in northeastern England and Scotland. Several fires broke out in a certain town in the Midlands, damaging several factories, several stores, and a theater. Three bombs also fell in a densely populated area in southwestern England, destroying two houses. Several people were trapped in the rubble. Rescue teams and demolition teams cleared the rubble in the darkness for an hour, rescuing two people. The remaining three people were buried in the rubble for three hours. They could still be heard, and rescue efforts were underway when enemy planes returned, but they were chased away by British planes and fled without dropping bombs. A key area in northeastern England was heavily bombed, which only ended this morning. The anti-aircraft fire was also very intense at the time, and many loud explosions were heard, mostly in the suburbs. Bombs fell in several places on the outskirts of a certain town in the London area, causing several small fires and damaging property. (Reuters dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>British People Have Effective Ways to Prevent Incendiary Bombs</p>
<p>London – During the enemy air raid on a residential area in a certain city in southeastern England last night, one noteworthy feature was that residents were well-versed in how to deal with incendiary bombs. The fires that were started were all extinguished before they became disasters. Even incendiary bombs that landed in open fields were moved to the side of the road by residents with shovels and left to burn themselves out. Air defense personnel were machine-gunned by enemy planes while working, but there were no casualties. (Reuters dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>Damage from London Air Raid Not Severe</p>
<p>London – Today, there are various signs that the German planes' attack on London on Saturday was a complete failure. Fires broke out in several places in a certain densely populated area, but the residents remained steadfast in the face of the air raid. Their response was one of unanimous hatred for Hitler and no fear. An official from the Department of Internal Security told a Reuters reporter after an inspection that the damage suffered by the London area and the city center was actually very slight and that there was no desolate or chaotic scene after the air raid. Several locations in the city may have traffic cordoned off today because there is broken glass everywhere and the windows and doors of many stores have been shattered, leaving them exposed. The areas of London that were bombed and damaged on Saturday night have been strictly forbidden for residents to pass through. A large square has been cordoned off with ropes, and buses have been rerouted. Even those living in nearby stores and houses must obtain a permit from the police before they can return home to check on their property. When this densely populated area was attacked, only one air raid warden was burned on the arm while helping to put out an incendiary bomb. When Portsmouth was attacked on Saturday, there were very few spectators in a certain movie theater that was hit by a bomb. Only a few people, including two women and one child, were killed by the bomb. When a large squadron of German bombers, escorted by fighter planes, appeared high overhead, the streets of Portsmouth were crowded with pedestrians, mostly residents who had gone to the stores for their weekly shopping. A small number of German planes that broke through the intense anti-aircraft fire split into small groups and indiscriminately dropped bombs, mostly in commercial and residential areas. In addition to the movie theater, a certain sports golf course, a commercial center, and a hotel were also hit. Several rows of coastal farms in Lancing were destroyed, leaving many people homeless, but the number of deaths and injuries was still light. After the German planes bombed a certain gas plant, firefighters were dispatched to put out the fire, but they were also strafed by German planes. A communique stated that regarding the air raid on Saturday night, further news had been received that factories and houses on the northeast coast had suffered slight damage, but there were no further reports of casualties. (Reuters dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>London – A certain bank on the outskirts of London was partially destroyed during an air raid on Friday. Yesterday, money and valuables were searched for in the rubble, with the Minister of Information, Mr. Greenwood, supervising. Most of the money has been recovered, but the account books are still buried in the rubble. The homes of the bank manager and his family were spared. The bank had a strongly built room, but this room happened to be hit and destroyed. Fortunately, the bank was hit before the alarm was issued, otherwise the manager and others would have taken refuge in this room and perished. (Reuters dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>London – An air raid alarm was issued in London this afternoon. German bombers, protected by fighter planes, encountered a fierce attack as they flew over the southeast coast. It was previously reported that three German planes were shot down. It is widely believed that two more were also destroyed. British Spitfire fighter planes engaged enemy planes in a fierce battle at an altitude of 30,000 feet. When German dive bombers dropped bombs on a certain city on the southeast coast, they destroyed several houses. Property in a certain area in the southwest suffered slight damage, and there were slight injuries among the residents. According to an announcement by the Ministry of Aviation, of the 55 enemy planes shot down yesterday, 43 were shot down in a battle near Portland. The battle was extremely fierce and unprecedented. Another six were destroyed by anti-aircraft batteries. (Reuters dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>London – Yesterday, when German planes bombed London, a bomb landed about 300 yards from the villa of the American Ambassador to England, Mr. Kennedy. Mr. Kennedy escaped unharmed. A tree planted by Queen Mary to celebrate the Allied victory in the World War at the American Ambassador's villa was destroyed by the bomb. A hole 30 feet deep and 27 feet wide was blown in the ground there. (United Press dispatch, 26th)</p>

<p>Yesterday's European dispatches reported that the British Air Force made a long-range raid across the sea on the German capital, Berlin, for its maiden attack; at the same time, 800 German planes suddenly attacked southeastern England. In short, the war between Britain and Germany continues to unfold in tension, without any slackening. However, among these events, there are signs that can be regarded as a pause. The British newspapers unanimously believe that the German offensive against England has now formed a chapter in itself and ended its first phase, and they claim that the British defense has defeated the initial German offensive. The famous Italian journalist, Mr. Gayda, wrote an article warning Britain not to claim victory simply because it has not been destroyed. Therefore, the gains and losses of the battles fought by both sides up to today, although there are different views and perspectives, are undoubtedly, to varying degrees, a section of the war when viewed in the context of British and Italian commentaries. Among these events, there are also signs that can be regarded as an interlude in the play. A dispatch reported that Pope Pius XII met with Mr. Taylor, the special envoy of the American President to the Vatican, on the 20th of this month to discuss the conditions under which Britain could accept peace without damaging its reputation, and to ask Mr. Taylor to seek Mr. Roosevelt's opinion on what role Britain would play in the new European order planned by Germany and Italy. The Pope believes that the opportunity for reconciliation has matured at this stage of the war between Britain and Germany. What we have seen and heard recently only makes us feel that the waves of the European situation are becoming more magnificent and the battle for air supremacy in Europe is becoming more intense. However, although the British and Italian newspapers say that the war will continue to evolve step by step, they both believe that it has come to an end. The Vatican not only sees it as an end but also believes that the opportunity to cease hostilities and seek peace has arrived. This perspective is difficult to imagine and leaves us feeling confused. This is one matter. The issue of French Indochina is closely related to international politics, the division of friends and enemies, the post-war situation, and the flow of resources. Among the countries that have a direct or indirect interest in Vietnam, except for France, if it can strengthen itself, plan its wisdom and courage, recognize that concession is no different from abandonment, recognize that flattery is not enough to achieve complete preservation, and go forward with firmness without avoiding difficulties and dangers, then its temporary encounter may be difficult to describe, but its long-term position may still be maintained. For other countries, the interests are not necessarily consistent, and there are even factors that contain abnormal contradictions with each other. However, in today's drastically changing international situation, all countries hope that France can maintain the status quo in Vietnam, and all countries even hope to be the shield behind France to defend Vietnam. France's situation is indeed extremely difficult, but the environment regarding the issue of Vietnam has eight or nine out of ten favorable conditions. To put it another way, although Germany and Italy have defeated France, they still do not want to regard Vietnam as a forbidden object and seize it for themselves. Although they are confronting Britain, they do not want to regard Vietnam as a base to shake their enemy. China must do everything in its power to resist aggression and prevent Vietnam from falling into the hands of the aggressors. Although Britain has heard of those who covet Vietnam using the excuse of passing through it to invade China, it clearly knows that such an excuse is actually a smokescreen to cover up their important plan to threaten British Burma and Malaya. As for the United States, it is even more terrified that if France cannot maintain Vietnam, then the Philippines will be in a situation where the lips are gone and the teeth are cold. Under such a favorable environment, how should the French authorities deeply understand that the current abandonment will be gone forever, first seek to preserve it during the transitional period of today's drastic international changes, and then seek to survive in the bargaining during the international final settlement in the future? How should they resolutely refuse all threats and demands, regardless of painful coercion, and restore the integrity of sovereignty and administration within Vietnam? Before the war, France had different paths in diplomacy when weighing the pros and cons and comparing priorities. During the war, when there was no time to take care of everything, there were different paths in diplomacy when there was something to avoid. Now that things have come to this point, there are no more different paths! However, news from Vichy is bizarre, absurd, and full of hesitation. Is it said that they are still afraid of the coercion of those who covet it? Is it said that they are still moved by the sweet words of those who covet it? It seems that there are other profound things worth considering. This perspective is difficult to imagine and is also making us feel confused. This is another matter. Perhaps, the accumulated grievances and complicated interests of the international community have been shrouded in heavy clouds for years. Even when the war broke out, there was initially no full confidence or the greatest determination. Therefore, when the two armies face each other, on the one hand, they use artillery fire because they are forced to, and on the other hand, they have other expectations and other brewing plans. Those below are still hoping to take advantage of the situation by following old routines. They are forced to go to war, but they have no certainty of victory, so they are trying to win favorable conditions for the war in many ways. The war between Britain and Germany is indeed magnificent, but each side has its own concerns and avoids using its main force to decide the outcome, and they are temporarily dividing the battle into stages, one and two. The Pope is compassionate and understands the subtleties of people's hearts. Although he knows the difficulty of mediation, he also believes that mediation has never been completely impossible from the beginning, so he wants to make an attempt at mediation at any time. The European situation is like this, which affects French Indochina, so that Germany clearly knows that it has no hope of gaining effective allies in the Far East, but there is a certain limit to its support for the Vichy government for the sake of the Vietnam issue. Even this limit is enough to make those who covet it understand that empty words are useless. Vietnam is still stuck in the midst of problems. Isn't this the reason?</p>
<p>London – A communique from the Department of Internal Security stated that when enemy planes raided a certain city in the Midlands last night, several people were killed and injured, and there was slight damage to municipal, industrial, and residential property.

<p>British Planes Heavily Bomb German Oil Factories</p>
<p>London – According to a report from the Ministry of Aviation, the German oil factory in Gelsenkirchen was one of the targets of the British plane raids on Saturday night. British squadrons bombed the factory in a systematic manner for over an hour. When the last plane flew away, the main part of the factory buildings was seen to be on fire and explosions were heard. British bombers also went to Hamburg and Frankfurt to bomb artificial oil factories. Many airfields in France, Belgium, and Holland were also attacked. A fire broke out in the woods near the De Kooy airfield and spread rapidly. The raging flames indicated that the gasoline stored in the woods had been hit. Two British planes also returned safely. Military targets in Milan and Turin, Italy, were also attacked by the British Air Force. All British planes returned safely after completing their missions. (Reuters dispatch, 26th)</p>

<p>Berlin – The German military headquarters recently released a supplementary battle report stating that Portsmouth, the main naval port of the British fleet, was attacked by the German Air Force on the 24th. Shipyards and storage depots were hit and caught fire. Reconnaissance planes that returned to Germany yesterday morning reported that the port was still in flames. Several airfields in northern Dover were destroyed. The Manston airfield, which had been bombed several times in the past few days, has now been abandoned by the British army. Hangars and nearby houses have been completely destroyed. The airfield in Canterbury has also suffered the same fate. A total of 57 British planes were shot down during the air battles on the 24th, and seven planes were destroyed on the ground. The German side lost 20 planes. On the 25th, the large oil pools in Bristol Harbor and Thameshaven, German factories in Birmingham, and many other locations were bombed. Seven merchant ships in the waters off Wick, escorted by British ships, were bombed and destroyed by German planes on the 24th. The wharves, warehouses, and a ship (2,500 tons) in Yarmouth Port were destroyed. Five merchant ships, each of 7,000 tons, were set on fire. On the 24th, German submarines sank a British destroyer and a merchant ship of 7,000 tons. (Haitong dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>Berlin – This afternoon, a German military report stated that submarines commanded by Commander Leysingen sank 46,170 tons of enemy cargo. The submarines had traveled far twice and sunk a total of 88,650 tons of enemy cargo. Another submarine sank four merchant ships, totaling 30,000 tons. Yesterday, German planes bombed the Warmwell airfield northwest of Portland and sank a merchant ship with a displacement of 4,000 tons. Last night, German fighter planes bombed aircraft factories and armories in Birmingham, Kings Norton, and Coventry, causing large fires and explosions. Last night, enemy planes flew over Berlin and dropped several incendiary bombs, which landed in the suburbs. This was the first time since the start of the war that enemy planes had attacked Berlin. Enemy planes also dropped bombs elsewhere, but did not hit military targets. German anti-aircraft guns shot down an enemy plane that flew over Berlin. In total, 72 enemy planes were shot down yesterday, of which 51 were shot down in air battles, and 21 were shot down by anti-aircraft guns or destroyed while parked on the ground. Fourteen German planes were missing. Yesterday, the German squadron led by Commander Molders achieved its 150th victory in the air. (Haitong dispatch, 26th)</p>
<h3>China Concentrates All Its Forces to Prepare for the Japanese Offensive; The Large-Scale Japanese Offensive Can Be Roughly Divided into Three Routes; If They Invade Chongqing, They Will Experience Great Difficulties</h3>
<p>Chongqing – The Chinese authorities are now concentrating all their efforts to prepare for the Japanese offensive. All political events have obviously been placed in a critical position. Although there is currently no concrete information on the Japanese military plans, people here believe that the Japanese army may launch a large-scale offensive in October, and they believe that the Japanese may make a desperate gamble in this offensive in an attempt to crush Chongqing's resistance. There are three possibilities that are generally expected: (1) The Japanese army may take the south bank of the Yangtze River, pass through Hubei Province and western Hunan, and launch a fierce attack westward on Chongqing. (2) The Japanese army may attempt to cross the Yellow River to invade Shaanxi Province in an attempt to seize Hanzhong, which is generally considered to be the northern gateway to Sichuan Province. (3) The Japanese army may attempt to invade Yunnan Province in an attempt to occupy Kunming, which would automatically close off the routes to Burma and Vietnam. All three offensives will be extremely difficult. The Japanese must send a large army into the mountains of Sichuan Province without any land or water supply to attack Chongqing. Crossing the Yellow River will not be easy, because there are still strong Chinese troops operating in the Japanese rear in Shanxi Province, and the Chinese army is now guarding the opposite bank of the Yellow River. As for the transportation in Yunnan Province, it is extremely difficult. The Chinese authorities there have completed their preparations to deal with the attack. It is widely believed that future military operations, even if not decisive battles, will be extremely noteworthy. (Reuters dispatch, 26th)</p>

<h3>Situation of This Year's Unified Enrollment</h3>
<p>Chongqing. In order to inquire about the recent handling of this year's unified enrollment, the reporter recently visited the person in charge of the Ministry of Education. According to reports, as of recently, there are still one or two places that have not been reported to the Ministry. The total number of candidates who have been reported nationwide is 19,014. If the number of people from places that have not been reported is included, it will not exceed 19,500. The actual number of examinees should be reduced according to the practice of the past two years. The total number of applicants is slightly less than last year, because the restrictions on equivalent academic ability this year are stricter. Last year, nearly 5,000 people applied with equivalent academic ability, but this year only more than 900 people did so. Therefore, the number of middle school graduates participating in the unified examination has actually increased by more than 2,000 people compared with last year. Currently, the results from various districts that have been sent are 15 districts, and Luoyang, Taihe, and Shanghai have not yet been sent due to transportation. The districts that have arrived are being reviewed and sorted out. Since more than four-fifths of the results from various districts have been sent, the admission and distribution standards can be determined, and the announcement date is in early September. The reporter asked again how the admission and distribution standards are and whether there will be any changes this year. According to the answer, the admission standards are determined based on the students' scores and the required number of places. In the past two years, the standards have been determined under the principles of not lowering the university level and taking into account national needs. This year's admission standards are also based on these principles and were passed at the second committee meeting yesterday, and the admission work is now being rushed according to these standards. The distribution standards have also been set. The distribution principles have been announced in this year's unified enrollment brochure. The first choice is not restricted by the examination area, and the distribution is based on the order of the students' scores with the same choice. If the first choice is full, the distribution will be based on the second and third choices to the schools and colleges in this examination area or nearby areas, still in the order of scores. If the schools in the area are full or there are no colleges to apply to, the Ministry will refer to the scores, characteristics, examination area, and choice of colleges and assign them to equivalent colleges or other colleges of similar nature. In the past two years, detailed procedures have been established for the distribution, which is absolutely based on scores, and often a difference of one point prevents them from achieving their wishes. For the same total score, the scores of Chinese, English, and mathematics must be used to determine the height. The distribution is arranged in the order of the scores of the candidates with the same choice, and the method is very complete and mechanical, but it is not subject to subjective influence. Even in the case of full assignment schools, the results are the main factor, and those with similar situations are decided by lottery. This assignment work was handled by another committee formed by the Unified Enrollment Committee last year, and this method will also be adopted this year, and seven members have been elected to discuss and decide to ensure that the standards are still followed strictly.

<h3>US Leases British Territories in the Western Hemisphere - Negotiations Have Achieved Concrete Results - Bermuda Islands are Strategically Important and the US Will Establish Defenses - Strategic Position is Equal to Hawaii Island in the Pacific</h3>
<p>Hamilton, Bermuda. Retired Governor of Bermuda, Mr. Brat, declared here yesterday that the United States has been allowed to use Bermuda's harbors as naval and air bases. Mr. Brat's statement was made in a message to the Bermuda Legislative Council's emergency meeting. Mr. Brat said, "I have informed the United States that I am very willing for Bermuda to become an important naval and air base for the United States to use to defend the Western Hemisphere." Mr. Brat's declaration is sufficient to show that the negotiations between Britain and the United States regarding the construction of naval and air bases by the United States in British territories in the Western Hemisphere have achieved concrete results. It is expected that other British territories in the Western Hemisphere that the United States wants to use to build naval and air bases will also have the same statement. (Dispatch of the 26th, United Press)</p>
<p>Washington. People here recently believe that Bermuda's approval of the US lease of the land to build naval, land and air bases is only the first step for the US to achieve the construction of naval and air bases in British territories in the Western Hemisphere. People here believe that the Bermuda base is strategically the most important point. Bermuda includes 300 small islands, 580 nautical miles from Halifax. According to naval experts, the islands enable the US naval and air forces to engage in effective Atlantic defense. The Bermuda base can also be quickly connected with other Caribbean bases to form part of President Roosevelt's Western Hemisphere defense plan. The strategic position of Bermuda, it is believed here, is the same as that of the Hawaiian Islands in the Pacific. Officials here also strongly stated that building naval and air bases in Bermuda is extremely important for defending Washington, Philadelphia, New York, and Boston in the event of an enemy attack. Naval experts also said that building a base in Bermuda will enable the US Navy to repair the loopholes in the current defense of the Panama Canal and can bring the US patrols closer to some South American republics and other areas in which the US and Britain are still negotiating to make them bases.

After eight months of surgery and examination by Dr. Jia, it was stated that the girl had the physiological conditions of an ordinary 20-year-old woman. The doctor had detailed tests of the girl's blood, urine, and other liquids, totaling more than 600 times, costing a total of 10,000 US dollars. Dr. Garnaki also said that he is trying to reduce the development of the girl's glands with the help of X-ray experts. (Dispatch of the 26th, United Press)</p>
<h3>US Senate to Pass Army Enlistment Bill - Very Self-Defense Program Costs Reach US$2 Billion</h3>
<p>Washington. Senate Democratic Leader Barkley predicted here last night that the Senate will pass the Army Enlistment Bill by a majority vote on Wednesday and Thursday. He expects that the amendments proposed by Navarre will be rejected because President Roosevelt has expressed opposition to the proposal. Before the Enlistment Bill is officially implemented, all other proposed amendments will not be adopted. According to the US emergency defense program, the cost will reach 2 billion US dollars. When German troops entered the Low Countries (i.e. the Netherlands) on May 16, President Roosevelt requested a budget of $1,182,000,000. The President's second request was on May 31, but on July 11, the President made a third, larger request to Congress, reaching $1 billion, which was immediately approved by Congress. In addition to this unprecedented amount of money, Congress also passed the "Two Ocean Navy" bill.</p>
<p>Navy Plan</p>
<p>The Navy's current plan is: (1) From 1946 to 1949, the number of ships will increase by 70% compared to the current number, with 35 battleships at that time, compared to only 15 ships. (2) The number of active-duty naval personnel will increase from 146,000 to 400,000 by 1946. (3) By 1944, new naval bases and airfields will be completed in the US mainland and its territories. (4) When the naval expansion is completed, the air force strength will be increased from 2,000 to 7,000 or 8,000 aircraft.</p>
<p>Army Plan</p>
<p>The Army plan is as follows: (1) By September of this year, the active army will be increased to 375,000, preferably by people voluntarily enlisting, and mobilizing 240,000 National Guardsmen. The Army Department proposed that the combined number of regular troops and National Guardsmen be increased to 1 million first, then to 1.2 million, and finally to 2 million. (2) Strengthen the air force strength, increasing it from 3,000 to 26,500 aircraft by May 1942. (3) By 1942, complete the arming of 1.2 million people and the needs for arming 800,000 people. (4) By May 1942, organize and train a new type of mechanized army. Related to this program is the production of military supplies, including increasing the rate of aircraft manufacturing, building new ammunition factories to produce bullets and store large quantities of important military raw materials.

After American bombers, reconnaissance aircraft, and destroyers adopted the new fuel system, their speed increased and they were able to quickly fly out of the range of anti-aircraft fire. This new type of aircraft has been unanimously adopted by the US Army and Navy. This type of aircraft equipped with a new fuel device can keep it still at the same altitude. This new fuel system aircraft was built by the Grant Elevator Engineering Plant in Dayton City, Ohio, and the flight test results show that aircraft without a new fuel device vary in altitude at high altitudes, that is, the aircraft is at one altitude today and another altitude tomorrow, but this aircraft with a new fuel system does not have this shortcoming and enables it to fly over 20,000 feet of altitude.

<h3>Scene from British-German Submarine Warfare: HMS Sealion Returns to Base After Sustaining Damage</h3>
<p>London: The British submarine HMS Sealion (670 tons) has returned to base after patrolling at sea. According to the captain, after HMS Sealion set out, it encountered a 3,000-ton cargo ship near the enemy coast and sank it with a torpedo, allowing the crew to reach land in small boats. Later, spotting a German submarine, it engaged in a gun battle, but the enemy submarine submerged to escape. HMS Sealion then detected the location of a German convoy and submerged to the middle of the formation, taking a superior position. Just as it was about to fire torpedoes, a German ship suddenly changed course and collided with HMS Sealion. Shortly afterward, the German ship dropped several depth charges, but none hit. HMS Sealion had to lie on the seabed until late at night before surfacing, only to find both periscopes damaged and other parts of the submarine slightly damaged. The crew, braving the dangers and hardships in the raging waves, cleared the damaged parts, but the night was too short to complete the work. HMS Sealion had to submerge again to wait for the next day. The location was not far from the enemy base, and warships were searching for submarines. Although HMS Sealion lost its periscopes, it still managed to navigate blindly back to its original base. (26th Reuters)</p>

<h3>Anniversary of the German-Soviet Pact: Contributes to Peace in Eastern Europe - Soviet Newspaper Publishes Article (Continued to End)</h3>
<p>At the time of signing, both sides understood that their friendly relations should not be hindered by differences in ideology and national systems. The signing of the German-Soviet non-aggression pact was on the eve of war, and the goals of British and French imperialism were already very clear. In this regard, we must not ignore this point. Furthermore, there is one more thing we must not forget: in the months before the signing of the German-Soviet pact, Britain and France repeatedly attempted to control the Soviet Union and use it as a tool for their imperialist plans. They also attempted to incite a German-Soviet war. Before the outbreak of this European war, the sole purpose of the war-mongers was to create a situation in which they could "reap the benefits of the fisherman." According to this plan, they re-invented the so-called "non-interference" policy, which gradually changed into a policy of appeasement. Although the style of the authors of this policy changed from time to time, their goals remained unchanged. In short, they incited German-Soviet animosity and planned to use Soviet power to attack a strong Germany. However, the signing of the German-Soviet pact ended this incitement and removed the hostility between the two countries. From this point of view, the German-Soviet pact can be called the most important fact for peace. Two major European powers have abandoned military action to resolve all disputes. This point must awaken the warmongers. But they remained unrepentant, and the European War broke out. Poland, under the machinations of London and Paris, was caught up in the war and, as we expected, was defeated. Thus, the Poland of Versailles was liquidated. On September 28, 1939, when German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop came here, the Soviet Union and Germany further concluded a treaty of friendship and borders, supplementing the deficiencies of the non-aggression pact. This new German-Soviet agreement is consolidating permanent peace in Eastern Europe and could also become the starting point for ending the European war. It is said that Germany proposed ending the war to Britain and France at that time, a proposal supported by the Soviet Union. As for the reaction of Britain and France, everyone knows. Stalin said in his reply to the editor of Pravda, "The ruling classes of Britain and France have resolutely rejected Germany's peace proposals and the Soviet Union's mediation." This proves that the responsibility for the subsequent bloodshed should be borne by London and Paris. It also proves that the new German-Soviet relationship aims not only to build peace between the two countries but also to build peace between all countries. The peaceful and solid nature of German-Soviet friendship can be proven by other facts. Since this is a fundamental change in German-Soviet relations, it should not be limited to political nature. We must solemnly declare that, in addition to political relations, the economic foundation of the two countries has also become more solid. Four days before the signing of the political treaty, the trade and credit agreement was signed in Berlin on August 19, 1939. The cooperation between the Soviet Union and Germany in foreign policy is fully in line with the interests of both sides, and the development of the two countries' economic relations also corresponds to this interest. There is no doubt about this. After the signing of the German-Soviet non-aggression pact, there was an extremely important political document. At the same time, the trade credit agreement signed on August 19, 1939, was further developed. On February 11, 1940, Germany and the Soviet Union concluded an economic agreement. To understand the scope of this economic agreement, we should declare that the development of trade between the two countries in the first year of its implementation was unprecedented since the war. According to this agreement, Germany has obtained a great deal of raw materials throughout the year. These raw materials were greatly needed by Germany due to the British blockade of Germany (this blockade has now extended to all of Europe). On the other hand, Germany supplies the Soviet Union with industrial products (including armaments). This is extremely important in the current tense international situation. The above-mentioned economic agreement has also aroused the anger of war-mongers, although this is their theory. The purpose of these politicians is to involve the majority of countries in the war. They will not hesitate to use force against those who oppose their plans. On the other hand, they will strengthen peaceful relations with other strong countries. The facts of the past year have fully proven the extremely important historical nature of the German-Soviet pact of August 23, 1939. In the current stormy period, the pact has endured all kinds of hardships. Although the enemies of the Soviet Union have spared no effort to create discord between the Soviet Union and Germany, the pact still stands firmly. Regarding this, it further proves the truthfulness of Molotov's report at the Seventh Supreme Soviet Congress. At that time, Molotov said, "The friendly relations between the Soviet Union and Germany are by no means a transitional measure. This relationship is indeed based on the fundamental national interests of both sides." This truth has long been understood by the Soviet Union and Germany, but there is a group of gentlemen who do not and do not want to understand this truth, and they determine various plans based on misunderstood truths. Therefore, the failure of this plan is inevitable. Looking at the facts of the past year, both sides should understand that the treaty signed on August 23, 1939, is indeed in line with the interests of both countries. At the same time, the treaty and the subsequent economic and political agreements have enabled Germany to have no worries about the East, aiming to solve Germany's economic problems. For the Soviet Union, the friendly relations between the Soviet Union and Germany will help the Soviet Union complete its national task on the western border and facilitate the Soviet Union to implement a neutral and peaceful foreign policy. A year ago, the people of the Soviet Union unanimously welcomed the conclusion of the German-Soviet pact. They believed that the pact proved that Germany had indeed recognized the Soviet Union's important role in international affairs. Today, the people of the Soviet Union still unanimously welcome the German-Soviet pact, believing that the pact has made great contributions to maintaining the peace of all of Eastern Europe.

<h3>Japanese Businesses Encroach on Concession Roads; Protests Not Responded To</h3>
<p>The English-language "Great American Evening Post" reports that regarding the merger of several Japanese shipping companies in Yangshupu, which has resulted in the encroachment on concession roads, the Municipal Council has protested to the Japanese authorities but has not yet received a response.</p>
<h3>Chinese Troops in the Soochow-Jiading Area are Quite Active</h3>
<p>According to those who have come to Shanghai from Wujiang, the Chinese guerrilla forces under Chen Yaozong, who are mobile in the Wujiang, Qingpu, and Jiashan areas, have become increasingly active recently. The regiment raided Xitang Town on the night of the 5th of this month with the first battalion, with great success. They killed several Japanese soldiers and obtained three rifles. The second battalion shelled Tongli Town. The Japanese troops stationed in the town retreated to the Wujiang area upon hearing the news. On the 11th of this month, the regiment, led by Commander Chen Yaozong in person with a machine gun company, patrolled the Jiaozhi, Chenmu, and Tongli areas, engaging in a fierce battle with the Japanese troops in the area for four hours. The Japanese troops retreated due to being unable to support themselves, and the Chinese troops obtained five rifles and one machine gun, and sunk two Japanese motorboats. On the 13th of this month, near Luhu and Beiku, they encountered a Japanese motorboat sailing from Lili. Chen led a company of soldiers in a desperate battle with the Japanese troops for an hour and a half. In this battle, seven or eight Japanese troops were killed or wounded, and only two Chinese soldiers were injured. The next day, more than one hundred Japanese troops, traveling on motorboats and small warships, went to Luxu, Xinta, and Jinze areas, intending to retaliate. However, because the Chinese troops were heavily guarded, they were unsuccessful.</p>
<h3>Hurricane Approaches Japan</h3>
<p>After the first hurricane in the Pacific made landfall west of Hong Kong and was destroyed in western Guangdong, the second hurricane, at six o'clock yesterday morning, has advanced to 33 degrees north latitude and 136 degrees east longitude, heading northeast.

As for the third hurricane, after reaching 16 degrees north latitude and 130 degrees east longitude, it has stagnated and may dissipate. The observatory is watching its development. Apart from the above two hurricanes, no new winds have risen.</p>
<h3>Bank of China Exchanges British Banknotes; All Exchange at Legal Fixed Price for Legal Tender; Exchange Deadline Extended to the 29th</h3>
<p>Since the British Embassy in China announced the prohibition of Bank of England banknotes entering the UK, and limited the delivery to a bank in China or mailed from a post office in China before midnight on August 27, in order to be credited when received in the UK, otherwise, they will not be received in the UK. Our Ministry of Finance, in order to take care of the interests of Chinese and foreign people holding these banknotes, has specifically designated branches of the Bank of China as the exchange agencies for British banknotes, in order to collect and transport them to the UK. However, according to a report from the "New Voice News Agency" reporter who inquired with the British Embassy, ​​the above-mentioned deadline has been extended by two days, that is, until midnight on August 29. Therefore, all those who hold Bank of England banknotes must exchange them for legal tender at the Bank of China before the deadline. Also, after the 29th, those traveling to the UK are still allowed to carry ten pounds of Bank of England banknotes.</p>
<p>Bank of China Exchanges at Legal Fixed Price</p>
<p>According to the Bank of China Shanghai Branch, although the branch has not received any notice from the head office regarding the exchange of British banknotes, all Chinese citizens who hold Bank of England banknotes may exchange them for legal tender at the branch. The bank exchanges them at the legal fixed price, that is, one yuan of legal tender is calculated as five pence and twenty-five. Each British banknote is exchanged for 45 yuan, 7 jiao, and 1 fen (national currency). As for the branches of the Bank of China in the interior, they have indeed received notices from the head office to exchange Bank of England banknotes.</p>
<p>British Banknote Market to Stop Listing Tomorrow</p>
<p>British gold banknotes are one of the foreign currency transactions on the market of the Shanghai Money Exchange Association. The market announces the buying and selling prices every day. Yesterday's selling price was 54 yuan, and the buying price was 53 yuan and 5 jiao. From tomorrow, the market may stop listing the British gold banknote prices. Other US dollar banknotes will continue as usual. However, in view of the British Embassy's announcement prohibiting the import of British banknotes into the UK, and not absolutely prohibiting their use, the members of the Money Exchange Association plan to decide whether to buy and sell in the future based on the actual situation. However, the price will inevitably be suppressed by the Money Exchange.</p>
<p>Financial Market Unaffected</p>
<p>A certain person in the Money Exchange market told a reporter from "New Voice News Agency" that the amount of British gold banknotes circulating in the Shanghai market is not large. If you want to buy a large number of spot tickets, there are no spot goods available. After the news of the ban on import into the UK came out, those who owned British gold banknotes in the market released them, causing rumors to rise and the supply from all parties to increase sharply, while the number of buyers was low, and the price fell sharply. The future situation of British gold banknotes is currently difficult to predict, and there is no relationship with the entire financial market. As for the member banks and businesses of the Silver and Money Industry Association, they do not operate in the British gold banknote business, and the member banks of the Money Exchange Association only provide agency buying and selling.</p>
<h3>French Ambassador Cosme to Broadcast Tonight</h3>

<h3>Retiring Municipal Council Staff Return to the UK to Serve</h3>
<p>The Municipal Council spokesman yesterday denied the rumors in the Japanese newspapers that a large number of Municipal Council staff had resigned. The spokesman said that the Municipal Council had not encountered a large-scale resignation of staff. He pointed out that some Municipal Council staff resign every year, which is a very common thing. The number of resignations this year may be higher than in the past, partly because many British staff members are eager to join the military for the country, but he denied that the resignation of most senior staff was due to dissatisfaction with working conditions.</p>
<h3>British Ambassador Sir Archibald Clark Kerr Leaves Shanghai This Morning; Stays in Chongqing and Returns to Shanghai at the End of the Year</h3>
<p>British Ambassador to China, Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, who has been staying in Shanghai for more than two months, is scheduled to board a ship leaving Shanghai at 12:00 last night and sail to Hong Kong. It is said that the ship will leave Shanghai early this morning and arrive in Hong Kong on the 28th. After a short stay in Hong Kong, the ambassador will fly directly to Chongqing and arrive in China's wartime capital before the end of this month to meet with the central authorities for important discussions. Accompanying the ambassador are several secretaries. His wife is still at Weihaiwei for summer vacation. The ambassador's trip to Chongqing coincides with the increasingly tense war clouds over the South China Sea and the increasingly serious threat to Vietnam and the British Far East territories by ambitious parties. Therefore, the general public attaches great importance to the ambassador's trip, but British officials only say that the purpose of the ambassador's trip is of an ordinary nature. It is said that the ambassador is expected to return to Shanghai in November.</p>
<h3>Completion of British Troop Withdrawal Today; British Warships Escort Southward; Five Transport Ships Concentrated at Wusong Estuary; Six British Warships Escort to Destination; Last Batch on De Sheng Wheel Departing Shanghai</h3>
<p>The third batch of British troops, numbering over six hundred, aboard the Jardine Matheson &amp; Co.'s Hao Sheng Wheel, set sail from the port at 4:00 PM the day before yesterday (Sunday). The final batch, originally scheduled to depart Shanghai yesterday aboard the British Company's Naknnda and Jardine Matheson &amp; Co.'s De Sheng Wheel, is now known to be departing today. The officers and families aboard the Naknnda boarded last night and are scheduled to depart this morning. The troops aboard the De Sheng Wheel requested boarding yesterday. After arriving in Shanghai from Tianjin, the ship first docked at the Ruirong Dock in Yangshupu. It was only moved from there on the morning of the day before yesterday, as it still needs to load a portion of the British troops being withdrawn from Tianjin and Beijing, which are expected to arrive here this morning. Therefore, the final departure is scheduled for 4:00 PM today, joining the other ships outside the Wusong Estuary to sail south together. At this point, all British troops in Shanghai will have been completely withdrawn.</p>
<p>Yesterday's Situation</p>
<p>According to the English-language Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury, approximately 200 British expatriates in Shanghai who volunteered for the British army boarded the Naknnda today (26th). It is noted that this ship previously belonged to the British Company but has now been requisitioned by the British War Department to transport troops. At the same time, a small number of British troops from the East Surrey Regiment and the West Yorkshire Regiment remaining in Shanghai completed their handover work and also boarded the British ships in the Huangpu River today (26th), heading for Hong Kong and Singapore. It is not yet known when the five British troop transport ships currently docked in Shanghai will set sail. However, it is widely believed that these ships will depart before Wednesday. Among the expatriates who enlisted in the army today is Sampson, the former local news editor of the English-language Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury.</p>
<p>Gathering at Wusong</p>
<p>The British authorities have requisitioned several ships, including Jardine Matheson's De Sheng, Yong Sheng, and Hao Sheng, the Eastern &amp; Australian Steamship Company's Danda, and the British Company's Naknnda, a total of five ships. Except for Jardine Matheson's De Sheng, which still needs to load a portion of the troops stationed in Tianjin and Beijing and remains docked at the Shuntai Wharf in Hongkou, scheduled to sail south at 4:00 PM today, the other four ships have successively loaded the withdrawing British troops and sailed south from Shanghai. However, according to information obtained by a reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency from relevant sources, although the above ships have departed one after another, they are still gathering and anchoring outside the Wusong Estuary and have not left. This is because they must wait for the De Sheng, which departs this afternoon, to sail south together.</p>
<p>British Warship Escort</p>
<p>The withdrawing British troops number a total of 1,750, and together with the British military commander and the families of various officers, the group is no less than 2,000. Ensuring maritime safety on this journey is of utmost importance during this time of war. Therefore, the British authorities have decided to dispatch six British gunboats, including the HMS Cricket, to escort the withdrawing British troops and their families southward.

<h3>Counterfeit Five-Cent Subsidiary Coins Discovered on the Market</h3>
<p>A reader of this newspaper, Gu Qi Jun, wrote in a letter yesterday, "To the esteemed editor, I am enclosing a counterfeit five-cent subsidiary coin note. I urge you to publish it in your newspaper to alert the people of this city not to accept this counterfeit currency, especially the common people. The counterfeiting of this note is extremely harmful. Although it is only a matter of a few cents, the accumulation of small amounts will have a great impact on society. Please publish this quickly to expose this heinous act. I am extremely grateful, Gu Qi."</p>
<p>This newspaper believes that Mr. Gu's enthusiasm is admirable and will specially reproduce the original note. However, the printed version may not be clear enough to fully show the genuineness of the counterfeit. However, the pattern of this note is crude and inferior, and it is immediately recognizable as a counterfeit. Moreover, the font of the numbers is smaller and the arrangement is uneven. It is hoped that everyone will pay attention when receiving five-cent subsidiary coins, so as not to be deceived.</p>
<h3>The Shanghai International Settlement Textile District; Temporarily Defended by White Russians; British Troops Completely Withdrawn and Defenses Vacated; Japanese Have Not Taken Over, and Preparations Must Be Made to Prevent Absence of Defenders</h3>
<p>According to authoritative sources from foreign official circles in this city yesterday, the British defense forces stationed in Shanghai have mostly withdrawn from Shanghai. A large detachment of the West Yorkshire Regiment, numbering approximately 600, which boarded the Jardine Matheson &amp; Co.'s Hao Sheng Wheel the day before yesterday, left Shanghai at 5:00 PM yesterday. The issue of who would take over the British military defense zone was originally decided at the Defense Force Command Meeting on the 15th of this month: District B would be taken over by the American military, and District D would be taken over by the Japanese military. However, the Japanese side had ulterior motives and reserved the right to raise other opinions on this decided proposal, which resulted in the American military not yet taking over District B. The Japanese side also has not yet taken over District D. In addition to District B being temporarily taken over by the A Company of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps, the defenses of District D are largely vacant. The Shanghai Municipal Council believes that after the withdrawal of the British troops, District D west of Jing'an Temple in the Shanghai International Settlement cannot be without any defense. Now that the Japanese side has been slow to take over, the Council has decided that before the takeover issue is resolved, the Shanghai Volunteer Corps will also temporarily be responsible for defense. It has already dispatched approximately fifty or sixty men from half of the White Russian Company to temporarily take over the defense in the area west of Jing'an Temple Road.</p>
<h3>National Salvation Bonds Interest; Paid in Full Legal Tender; However, There Is No Paying Agency in Shanghai; Bondholders Can Entrust Banks to Collect on Their Behalf</h3>
<p>The National Debt Fund Management Committee has consulted with the four banks of China, Central, Communications, and Farmers regarding the discounting and payment of principal and interest on domestic debt guaranteed by customs revenue. The discounting application procedures are now recorded as follows: (1) The matured principal and interest coupons for discounting applications are limited to the Unified Recovery Gold Long Third Bonds; (2) Each type of government bond interest coupon must be bundled into a stack of fifty or more coupons; (3) Various principal and interest coupons for Unified Government Bonds can be filled out on one form. If there are both Unified Recovery Bonds, two forms should be filled out separately. Government bond interest should be subject to a 5% income tax deduction. All holders of matured interest coupons and drawn lottery tickets for the Unified Recovery Gold Long Third Bonds can obtain an application form from the paying Central Bank, fill it out, and submit it together with the principal and interest coupons for verification and receipt by the bank, and issue a discount voucher and the first installment of the voucher payment.</p>
<p>Recovery Bonds</p>
<p>The Central Bank of China, Shanghai Branch, has recently received orders from its head office to jointly discount and pay the ninth installment of principal and interest on the 25th Year of the Republic Recovery Bonds together with the China and Communications Banks from the 31st of this month. The fourteenth installment of principal repayment for the 17th Year of the Republic Long-Term Financial Bonds will be drawn on September 10, and the principal and interest will be discounted and paid starting on September 30, in accordance with the discounting and payment procedures.</p>
<p>National Salvation Bonds</p>
<p>Regarding the National Salvation Bonds issued by the National Government on September 1, 1937, with a total amount of 500 million yuan, the third interest payment of 20 million yuan, as stipulated in the regulations, will begin on August 31 of this year. The matured interest payment has already been allocated by the Ministry of Finance from the national treasury revenue and deposited in a special account at the Central Bank for reserve payment. It is now decided to handle the payment as scheduled. However, there is no paying agency in Shanghai, so all bondholders can entrust banks to collect the interest payment from the China and Communications Banks in Hong Kong, which is in full legal tender and not in the form of Shanghai's "劃".</p>

<h3>Gaodeng Arrives Safely at Songmen; Successful Trial Voyage; No News of Hana Sailing to Gu'ao; Xin'anna Sailing to Fuqing Has Declared Customs</h3>
<p>The Far East Company's German ship Hana's re-trial voyage on the ancient coastal route to Zhejiang is of great importance to the future of the entire Zhejiang route, so all parties are paying close attention. The ship set sail from Shanghai on the evening of the 24th.</p>
<p>Hana Itinerary</p>
<p>The expected itinerary is that it has already arrived at the mouth of the Ao River, but as of yesterday, Hana Company has not yet received a telegram. There should be a telegram today. There is also no news of the Italian ship Maberia, which was detained by a Japanese warship at the mouth of the Ao River. Another Portuguese ship, the Minhe, is scheduled to test sail to Wenzhou tomorrow morning. The German ship Gaodeng, which tested the Songmen port, telegraphed yesterday morning that it had arrived safely at Songmen and unloaded its cargo, so the trial voyage on that line has been declared a success. The Wenzhou Shanghai Fellow Villagers Association began registering fellow villagers returning to their hometowns yesterday. As for how to travel, it is still being planned. If the number of people is large, they plan to rent a foreign ship and consult with the consulate authorities to issue export permits, specifically for fellow villagers returning to their hometowns.</p>
<p>Xin'anna Wheel</p>
<p>Regarding the Fujian route, after the Fuqing port Jianghai Customs approved the customs clearance, the British ship Xin'anna, represented by Fangsheng Company in this city, decided to test sail from Shanghai to Fuqing. The ship was originally scheduled to leave Shanghai yesterday, but it was learned that the customs clearance procedures have not yet been completed and the departure has been postponed. According to the company, the ship is scheduled to depart from Shanghai on the afternoon of the 28th.</p>
<p>Freight Increase</p>
<p>It is also learned that various shipping companies are planning to increase freight rates to compensate for the losses caused by the slow shipping, inconvenient loading and unloading of cargo, and delays in the shipping schedules of Zhejiang and Fujian, which are not listed as blocked ports. There is talk of a 20% increase, but no official announcement has been made.</p>
<h3>Epidemic Rages in Songjiang; Appeal to Shanghai for Relief</h3>
<p>Since entering the hot season, an epidemic has broken out in Songjiang. The initial symptoms are soreness in the limbs, fever, and more severe cases linger for weeks with persistent fever, resulting in a high death rate. It was initially discovered only in the urban area, but it has recently spread to various villages, and the number of patients is increasing day by day, which is worrying. Local sanitation facilities and the original medical assistance efforts have been inadequate in funding since the war, making it difficult to provide adequate assistance. As a result, the poor and sick are unable to receive treatment and are groaning in bed, which is extremely pitiful. The Songjiang Red Cross Branch in Shanghai and the Shanghai Fellow Villagers Association have requested Wen Lanting, Huang Hanzhi, and other leaders of various charitable organizations in this city to allocate good medicine for distribution and relief, and are also soliciting effective medicines for treatment to eliminate the disease.</p>
<h3>Robbers Attempt to Kidnap Infant in Chunpingfang, Hart Road; Police Arrive in Time and Intercept Robbers</h3>
<p>A resident surnamed Mou, residing at No. 5, Lane 4, Chunpingfang, Hart Road, Jing'an Temple Road, west of Shanghai, has a son who is not yet one year old and is still in swaddling clothes. At around 8:00 AM yesterday, the wet nurse Du Ma was holding the infant in her arms and playing at the entrance of the lane when four robbers suddenly appeared. Three of them were wearing long gowns, and one was wearing a white short uniform. They drew handguns and threatened and intimidated the wet nurse. The robber in white shirt and pants stepped forward and forcibly snatched the child, and the robbers fled in all directions. A furniture store clerk and others at the entrance of the alley witnessed the situation and, together with the maid, followed in pursuit and shouted for help. At that time, a Western police officer from the Jing'an Temple police station near Hart Road, Aveneue Road, together with several Chinese police officers, were searching pedestrians in the area. Hearing the alarm, they rushed to pursue, and as a result, one of the robbers holding the infant was arrested on the spot. The remaining robbers escaped without a trace. Fortunately, the child was unharmed and was able to return to its parents.</p>
<h3>Owner of Timber Business Abducted Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>At around 8:00 AM yesterday morning, Hu Yangwu (字 Guopei), the owner of the Guotai timber yard at No. 7, Lane 356, Kangti Road, Malang Road in the French Concession, was suddenly kidnapped. At the time, the people in the yard were unaware of the abduction. Later, after the French police received the news and sent officers to investigate, they learned that he had been abducted. Therefore, the circumstances of the abduction are unknown. The police are currently investigating the case.</p>
<h3>Handgun Used by Gang of Thieves Stolen from Chinese Police; Involved in Three Cases</h3>
<p>At 1:00 PM on the 24th of this month, the home of Fu Zhongshan at No. 8, Renjili, Lane 433, Xinzha Road, was invaded by four thieves who stole cash and jewelry worth 500 yuan. While they were looting, a relative of Fu, Mr. Jia, arrived and, upon seeing the situation, immediately returned to the Xinzha police station to report the incident. Yang Yunfeng, the Chinese detective on duty, led a team of Chinese and Western police officers to arrest them. Because the thieves resisted arrest, the detectives opened fire, resulting in one thief being wounded in the leg and falling from the roof into the courtyard of No. 10, breaking his head and dying. The detectives seized a handgun and three bullets from the dead thief. Another thief, Gao Shunfa from Wuxi, was arrested on the roof, and a handgun, seven bullets, and the original stolen gold ring were seized. A large portion of the stolen goods was also found on the roof. The two remaining thieves took the opportunity to escape. The arrested thieves were taken back to the police station, and the dead thief was taken to the morgue for examination. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Second Criminal Division of the First Special Court. The police lawyer Li Zhishan explained the incident and requested permission for a later hearing because two accomplices were still at large. After Judge Liu Yugui questioned them, he ordered them to be detained pending a later hearing. According to investigations, the handgun held by the defendant Gao was the one issued by the Shanghai Municipal Council to Chinese police officer No. 1593, which was stolen on the 26th of last month at the intersection of Connaught Road and Yanping Road. Moreover, this gun has been involved in two theft cases in the Public Concession since it was stolen. The police are currently investigating the matter in detail.</p>
<h3>Case of Forged Domestic Goods Certificate; Defendant Shifts Blame to Others; Shanghai Chamber of Commerce States That Certificate is Free; Cotton Cloth Industry Association Also Issued Notice</h3>
<p>Chen Yongsen, the owner of Zhikang Cotton Cloth Store at No. 20, Bai'er Road, Nanyang Bridge, was sued by He Bodian, the owner of Yongtaixiang Cotton Cloth Store in Qingyuanli, Beijing Road, for forging a domestic goods certificate from the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce. He hired lawyer Mao Xianshen to file a lawsuit in the Criminal Division of the Second Special Court, accusing him of forging documents and committing fraud and breach of trust, and demanding compensation of 27,840 yuan. After several summonses by Judge Li, the matter was adjourned to a later date because the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce was also investigating the truth of the matter, so the situation was quite serious. Chen Yongsen was released on bail and ordered to produce the person by a deadline. The details have been recorded in previous reports. The hearing continued yesterday afternoon. First, the witness Yang Peisheng, Deputy Inspector of the Central Police Station of the Public Concession, testified that the defendant went to the police station on July 9 and claimed that Wang Xianglin, the owner of the Bailey Company in the Hartung Building on Nanjing Road, had previously asked him to forge a domestic goods certificate, but they were all counterfeits. Now, he is being pursued, so he requested the arrest. I went with the defendant.</p>
<p>Wang Has Fled</p>
<p>Only his brother, Jin Fu, was there, and he did not know the rest. Another witness, Qian Chuntian, testified that I am a broker and was entrusted by the plaintiff to purchase goods from the defendant. It was stated that each piece would cost 38.5 yuan, including the certificate fee. Now, the defendant denies that the certificate fee was included, which is nonsense. Finally, Zhu Zijun, the owner of the Jiufu Cloth Factory, testified that the defendant was previously my apprentice. Wang Xianglin was not familiar with the store when he purchased cloth, so I introduced him to the defendant. I do not know about the matter of entrusting the printing of the certificate. Questioned, the defendant testified that he only admitted that the price per piece was 37.5 yuan. The price of 38.5 yuan on the invoice was entirely instructed by the customer and cannot be used as a standard. At this point, the plaintiff's lawyer, Mao, submitted two letters to the court, stating that since the last adjournment, he had investigated with the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce whether there was a handling fee for issuing certificates. According to the Chamber's reply, the certificate does not incur any fees and has been notified to all members. At the same time, he investigated with the Cotton Cloth Industry Association whether the defendant's Zhikang store was a member.</p>
<p>According to the Reply Letter</p>
<p>Zhikang was admitted to the association in December 1938. In this way, the defendant had already received a notice from the Cotton Cloth Industry Association that the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce does not charge fees for issuing certificates. Why would he entrust Wang Xianglin to print them? He deliberately colluded in this way to defraud the plaintiff of the certificate fee of 432 yuan. The court should punish him accordingly. The court verified the facts and ruled that the case would be heard again on the 3rd of next month.</p>
<h3>Police and Robbers Fight in Putuo Road; One Robber Shot and Killed</h3>
<p>At 4:15 AM yesterday morning, someone suddenly shouted "robbers" at the intersection of Xiaoshadu Road and Putuo Road in western Shanghai. Several Chinese and Western detectives on patrol happened to be passing by and, upon hearing the cries, discovered four men in short clothing in the darkness who appeared suspicious. Knowing that they were not good people, they stepped forward and ordered them to stop. Unexpectedly, the men were indeed robbers and took the initiative to fire their guns. The detectives also returned fire, and a burst of gunfire erupted. As a result, one of the robbers was shot in the head, chest, and left leg and fell to the ground. The robber was wearing a black short shirt and pants and fell on the ground at the entrance of No. 1233, Xiaoshadu Road. A handgun was seized. The robber died from his injuries. At the same time, a Chinese detective No. 1025 from the Putuo Road police station was shot in the leg by a robber's bullet. After calling for an ambulance, the wounded detective and the dead robber were sent to the police hospital, and the robber's body was sent to the morgue for examination. It is now reported that the police have found that the handgun held by the dead robber was a self-defense handgun stolen from a Shanghai patrol officer some time ago. The case is now under investigation by the police.</p>
<h3>North-China Daily News Reports Japanese Robbery Arrested; Transferred to Japanese Consulate Police Station</h3>
<p>According to the North-China Daily News, at around 1:00 AM yesterday (25th), a Chinese man, Mr. Jia, was walking alone along Zhaofeng Road when two Japanese robbers suddenly jumped out from the roadside near Zhoujiazuizui Road and robbed him.

As soon as the Japanese had obtained the money, Mr. Jia immediately called the police and chased the two robbers, who were trying to escape. One of the robbers was captured and taken to the Jiaxing Road police station. However, the stolen money was not found on the Japanese man, as it had been handed over to another robber who had escaped. The police then transferred the Japanese man to the Japanese Consulate Police Station, accusing him of robbery.</p>

<h3>School News Summary</h3>

Although there were many applicants this time, in order to improve the standards of the academic program, the school did not admit many new students, so the quota was not full.

As for the remaining quota, it is still planned to continue to enroll new students and transfer students on September 5th. It is also reported that the school, in response to the requests of major hospitals in this port, plans to add an advanced vocational nursing class to recruit first-year students.

<h3>Finance: Public Sentiment Is in a State of Confusion, Engaging in Bullish Activities in Foreign Exchange</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market situation: HSBC quotations remained unchanged. In the black market for British and American currency, a tight wind suddenly arose. The market was affected by rumors, and public sentiment was in a state of confusion, engaging in bullish activities. It was said that the Vietnamese authorities had allowed Japanese troops to pass through to attack China, and that someone would be appointed as the Minister of Finance or Premier of the Executive Yuan. Speculators colluded, with the amount of U.S. dollars reaching over 600,000. Foreign banks absorbed British gold and exchanged it for U.S. dollars, but would not sell unless at a high price, resulting in a trend of tightening without turning back. British gold softened from 3 pence 6875 to 3 pence 625, and U.S. dollars tightened from 5 yuan 5625 to 5 yuan 40625, both closing at the tightest price. British currency tightened by 0625 and U.S. dollars by 1875. The transaction volume was quite active.</p>
<p>Rumors Fuel Buying Fever</p>
<p>In the early morning, the exchange rate was stable. The British currency against the U.S. dollar was unchanged, and it was also stable against Shanghai currency. The U.S. dollar depreciated by 25 against the British currency, but it was not changed against Shanghai currency. There was no market for French currency. The central quotations for various currencies remained the same. Banks opened for spot sales in the morning, with British gold at 3 pence 6875 and U.S. dollars at 5 yuan 5625, with British currency stable and U.S. dollars softening by 03125 compared to the closing price of last Saturday. The initial market was relatively calm after opening. It was estimated that foreign firms were doing spot transactions among themselves at 6875 pence. However, soon Chinese speculators entered the market to buy, and the potential trend turned tight. It was estimated that speculators entered foreign firms with U.S. dollars for the current month at 5 yuan 5625, reaching 53125. The official exchange rate was announced, and it remained unchanged. The balancing tax for silver was also announced, and there was no increase or decrease. After that, there were also people with favorable intentions buying. It was estimated that U.S. dollar holders were holding on to half a yuan for October, and at that time, positive news came out, such as Vietnam allowing Japanese troops to pass through, causing public sentiment to be unanimously bullish, and speculators continued to buy. It was estimated that U.S. dollar holdings in foreign firms for September were at 5 yuan 50 cents, and by around 11:30 a.m., speculators were eating up August U.S. dollar holdings at McCallister and others at 5 yuan 50 cents, and the current U.S. dollar also softened to 5 yuan 50 cents. The market was still very tight at the close, with British gold at 3 pence 671875 and U.S. dollars at 5 yuan 50 cents, with British currency softening by 015625 and U.S. dollars tightening by 0625 compared to the opening price in the morning.</p>
<p>Fewer Sellers in the Afternoon</p>
<p>The market was even softer in the afternoon, with complex rumors, and public sentiment was in a state of confusion. Sellers were reluctant to sell, and buyers were eager to buy, and the supply and demand felt quite uneven. Initially, Chinese firms sold spot orders to foreign firms at 3 pence 65625, and later, Chinese speculators and others came to buy U.S. dollars for September at 5 yuan 40625, and August dollars also reached 5 yuan 4375. By the close, spot U.S. dollars were at 5 yuan 40625, and the prior orders were at 3 pence 625. The September British gold was at 3 pence 609375, and U.S. dollars were at 5 yuan 375. Compared to the close of the previous weekend, British gold for both spot and forward orders softened by 0625, and U.S. dollars tightened sharply by 875.</p>
<p>Hong Kong U.S. Dollar Tightens</p>

<h3>Rumors Intensify, Gold Price Increase Turns Fierce, Exceeding 5,915 Yuan Outside the Market</h3>
<p>Yesterday, spot gold and black market prices rose unprecedentedly sharply. According to the afternoon trend outside the market, it rose by as much as 200 yuan. This was due to positive rumors and a sharp contraction in drafts, which led operators to buy vigorously. The price was only 5,730 yuan in the early morning. After securities firms and banks bought in, it rose to 5,785 yuan. However, gold firms came to sell, slightly falling by tens of yuan. Eventually, a strong buying spree broke out, and gold firms and money exchange shops all reversed from selling to buying, raising the price sharply to 5,830 yuan at the close, an increase of 105 yuan compared to the previous day. It was reported that transactions outside the market were done at 5,915 yuan in the afternoon, and the market atmosphere was unusually firm and strong. The transaction volume was quite active in the first half of the day, about 3,000 taels. Jewelry gold in silver shops finally increased by 10 yuan, while customs gold remained flat.</p>
<p>Spot Gold Rises by Over 100 Yuan</p>
<p>Since the morning, each bar (ten taels) initially had more sellers, and the market only rose by 5 yuan at the opening. Money exchange shops sold 20 taels from silver shops at 5,730 yuan. Then, securities firms and banks competed to buy in, immediately rising by 55 yuan. Silver shops traded 10 taels with each other at 5,785 yuan. Then, gold firms came out to join the bullish side, and money exchange shops added to their short positions. The market was difficult to boost for a while, and fell slightly by more than 20 yuan. Securities firms sold 20 taels from silver shops at 5,758 yuan. After that, because foreign exchange remained tight, silver shops and securities firms came to buy in again, and it soared again by 37 yuan. Money exchange shops bought 10 taels from gold firms at 5,795 yuan. Later, silver shops came to sell slightly, returning slightly by more than 10 yuan, falling to 5,780 yuan. Eventually, due to the tight foreign exchange and various positive news at the time, the buying spree surged at once. Gold firms and money exchange shops also reversed from selling to buying, and before the close, it soared to 5,835 yuan, and the noon close was also 5,830 yuan, an increase of 105 yuan compared to the previous day. In the afternoon, the market decided to close due to the holiday today. However, there was no shortage of transactions outside the market, and the price fluctuated by 50 to 60 yuan. Initially, it was high at 5,8780 yuan, and then it was as high as 5,915 yuan. Later, due to the easing of the foreign exchange market, it returned slightly, and the final price was 5,8780 yuan. The difference between the noon trade was 105 yuan. The selling price of spot gold at cash gold firms was more than 10 yuan higher according to spot gold, and the purchase price was 30 yuan lower. The current benchmark gold was more than 90 yuan lower than the listed gold, and there were few transactions.</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold Also Increases by 10 Yuan</p>
<p>The exchange rate for jewelry gold per tael in silver shops was initially still 590 yuan at Datonghang. At 11:30 a.m., it increased by 10 yuan. After that, there was no change. It was estimated that Datonghang changed to 600 yuan, and the new firms had similar prices to the above, and the purchase price was about 30 yuan lower.</p>
<h3>U.S. Dollar Bills: Highest at 18 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market situation: Spot gold continued to rise sharply, and British and American gold pounds also rose by one yuan each. British and American gold bill transactions remained active, and market prices softened slightly. U.S. dollar bills were as high as 18 yuan 50 cents in the afternoon, eventually settling at 18 yuan 38 cents, an increase of 46 cents compared to last Saturday. This was because the news about Vietnam was very bad. Hong Kong bills continued to rise by one cent, and there was also demand for Japanese gold bills, with the evening market reaching as high as 1 yuan 46 and a half cents. Korean bills had even supply and demand, and the evening market remained at the original price of 1 yuan 08 and a half cents.</p>
<h3>Financial Review by Jin Shurong (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Saint Ke Qiong</p>
<p>——August 24th——</p>
<p>Recently, the public bond market has appeared in the market with a posture of continuous rise (before the 21st). There is also an explanation of the reserve fund in Article 1 of the Provisional Measures for Managing Banks in Extraordinary Times. The general idea is that 20% of continued deposits must be used as a reserve fund, but the situation in Shanghai is special, and perhaps a flexible approach can be adopted, matching a certain percentage of public bonds in the 20% reserve fund, thereby explaining the high bond market, which is almost the purchase of funds by the financial sector. This explanation is naturally more progressive than the previous one. However, it is still necessary to consider whether it is the driving force behind the bond market. I think there are two basic assumptions that must be understood first:</p>
<p>The first point is that the bank management measures (please refer to the Financial Review on August 18) are general. It is better to say that it emphasizes the free China region than to say that it emphasizes Shanghai based on Articles 3 and 4, because banks using deposits without following Articles 3 and 4 is not unique to Shanghai. In fact, Articles 4 and 5 clearly focus on free China. The second point is that if this law is to be implemented, Articles 6 to 9 must be amended and implemented to suit the environment. The second article cannot be implemented alone. The management measures are a whole set of guiding, supervising, and controlling regulations, which cannot be separated for implementation. Once separated, it cannot achieve the effect of control. After recognizing these two assumptions, it can be seen that whether the law will be implemented in Shanghai is still unknown. Banks must know that their funds are safe and reliable before they can start. It is still unknown whether they will purchase public bonds as part of their reserve fund.</p>
<p>So, what is the reason for the high bond market? One is the stability of the speculative market, and the other is the evolution of the situation. Taking foreign exchange in the speculative market as an example, after turning tight at the beginning of the month, the U.S. dollar has been hovering at 5 yuan 50 cents, and the British gold has been hovering at 3 pence 7 cents. The difference between the spot and September forward market is very small, and there is no profit to be made. The yarn flower market is also very depressed, so funds are moving to the public bond market. If the market price differs by one yuan, there is a profit of more than 1%, which is at least an interest rate of one point per month. Therefore, it is better to move to public bonds than to stay in foreign exchange and yarn flowers. In terms of the situation, since August, the United States has been tough on Japan, the conflict between Britain and Japan has unfolded, the tension in Vietnam, the issue of defense forces, and the situation in China have all had a considerable impact.

<h3>Imported Goods?</h3>
<p>Since the maritime traffic lines have been constrained, and due to the tension in Europe, the import of foreign goods has been decreasing. However, people in Shanghai still believe in imported goods. Of course, businessmen cater to the preferences of customers. Customers do not distinguish between the quality of goods, but only know that imported goods are good. Therefore, there are many imported goods circulating in the Shanghai market. Some are labeled with foreign symbols, decorated in a Western style, and priced according to the exchange rate. The cost is entirely the cost of manufacturing in Shanghai. Customers take it as soon as they like it, but who knows it is imported goods in disguise! Let me give an example! A certain factory recently received a transaction from a foreign firm, ordering "green felt glass plates" with white steel strips at the four corners for desks. It must be marked as made in a certain foreign country, and the transaction was negotiated through an intermediary. The first intermediary talked business with the factory, reducing the order price from two yuan per foot to one yuan and five cents per foot, but the commission (Kang Mixin) of the first intermediary was added to one yuan and five cents, so the pricing became three yuan per foot. Unexpectedly, the second intermediary (the orderer entrusted by the first intermediary) also requested to add one yuan of Kang Mixin to the cost, and it changed from three yuan per foot to four yuan per foot. The foreign firm added a huge profit, pretending it was an imported product, changed the pricing to foreign currency, and sold it to Chinese people who could not distinguish between Chinese and Western goods. The buyers still talked about it with relish, saying it was a Western product! Do you think it is unjust or not? To know that impersonating foreign goods to deceive Chinese people is unknown, and this is especially a small one. (Island Guest)</p>
<h3>Securities: Rumors Arise Again, Public Bonds Stop Rising Suddenly</h3>
<p>Yesterday's security black market situation: Due to the market being closed today for the birthday of Confucius, the market only traded for half a day in the morning yesterday. The market was slightly firmer, but not enthusiastic. Neither Type B nor Type D bonds were traded. The market was affected by the defense zone issue, and new problems arose that have not been resolved. At the same time, rumors arose, so the bond market could not be smooth, and there are still many changes in the future, making it difficult to predict. Yesterday's transactions were slightly interested in Xinchang, Lianyi, and Hengfu. Scattered retail investors made up for short positions slightly. Tongxinghao entered first and then exited. Lemao sold more, and Datong also cut more. The market was closed in the afternoon for settlement, and the market price was slightly better by 10 to 20 cents. The trading volume for half a day was about 400,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below:</p>
<p>Stock transaction, 100 shares of Bank of Communications were traded, priced at 60 yuan and 5 cents.</p>
<p>In addition, the stock market opened weakly at the Public Industry Association yesterday. The bullish forces were relatively weak because there were too many overnight long positions last week, resulting in high prices for selling. However, the situation changed suddenly, and the long positions came to add to their positions at low prices, and the market turned bullish again. The loosening of silver and the strong potential trend could not be denied. The transaction volume was extremely large yesterday. The fortunes of industrial stocks and rubber stocks rose and fell on each other. Initially, it was not limited to one or two special categories.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Yarn Inventory Nears 300,000 Bales, Speculative Excitement Intensifies</h3>
<p>The yarn market continued to be firm, and the rising trend was fierce. This was due to rumors in the market that the cessation of the use of British gold pounds would benefit long positions in cotton yarn. People were excited, and a buying spree was set off. Speculators became more and more excited, buying from each other. For a time, chips were slightly scarce, and the upward pressure was even stronger. However, there was more activity in Hong Kong. However, short positions argued that the inventory of yarn in the warehouses of this port was gradually increasing, approaching 300,000 bales. Shipping to Hong Kong had been interrupted, but the long positions said that these goods were all in the hands of hoarders and would not be released for a while, so it was probably not related to the overall situation.</p>
<p>When the spot market opened in the morning, the sentiment was good. Most of the "scalpers" in the market tended to buy. 20-count Double Horse opened at 950 yuan, up 7 or 8 yuan. Then, it fluctuated between 954 yuan for a long time. Unexpectedly, around 11 o'clock, there were many positive rumors, and the buying spree suddenly broke out. In a short time, it suddenly jumped from 960 yuan to 970 yuan to 80 yuan. Later, after those who made profits sold, it returned slightly to 973 yuan. Today is the birthday of Confucius, and the market is closed. The scattered short positions must be squeezed to avoid risks. It was found that the transaction volume in half a day was 2,260 bales, and the market price of 20-count Double Horse rose by 30 yuan. Today, 85 pieces of cotton yarn were shipped to Yantai and 135 pieces were shipped to Hong Kong. The amount bought by each gang is listed separately as follows:</p>
<p>Hong Kong 600, Tongxing 1, Wenzhou 6406 10</p>
<p>Xiamen 50, Statistics 2,260</p>
<h3>Medicine</h3>
<p>E Zhi Ren Arrives, Price Drops by Twenty to Thirty Yuan</p>
<p>E Zhi Ren (Alpinia Oxyphylla) continues to arrive, but the demand for processing it has decreased, leading to a continuous decline in market prices. Yesterday, ordinary goods were offered at 100 yuan, a decrease of twenty to thirty yuan compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>Hardware</p>
<p>Pig Lead Stabilizes</p>
<p>Although the pig lead trade is not bustling, the tight supply has stabilized prices. Currently, it sells for 115 yuan per dan. The largest market for this product is inland, with only sporadic business seen from local factories. It is reported that battery factories, printing factories, and paint factories purchased forty to fifty dan yesterday, keeping the market stable.</p>
<p>Dried Goods</p>
<p>New Melon Seeds Drop by Five to Six Yuan</p>
<p>According to reports from the producing areas, this year's black melon seed harvest is only one-tenth to one-twentieth of normal. Consequently, the prices at the source are extremely high, exceeding those in Shanghai. However, as this is a consumable item, high prices naturally reduce sales. As a result, Shanghai prices have declined. Yesterday, several dozen packages were offered, with Tongcheng seeds priced at 88 yuan, down five yuan, and Linhuai Guan seeds at 84 yuan, down six yuan. It is reported that trading companies are mostly observing prices at the source, and there is hope for easing in the future.</p>
<p>New Candied Dates Gradually Decrease</p>
<p>Since the arrival of new candied dates, shipments from Suzhou and Jiaxing have continued, causing prices to gradually decline. Yesterday, "bald" dates were selling for only 130 yuan, a decrease of more than ten yuan compared to mid-month. This is due to sluggish sales and continued arrivals of supply.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous News</p>
<p>Southern Meat Supply Cut Off</p>
<p>After the ports of Ningbo and Wenzhou in Zhejiang Province were blockaded, the supply of southern ham has been completely cut off, causing prices to soar. If no shipments arrive within a few months, there will be a shortage. Currently, freshly processed southern meat is selling for 140 yuan per dan according to the Shanghai market scale, and wind-dried meat is selling for 136 yuan per dan.</p>

<p>Magistrate Commits Suicide</p>
<p>Several days ago, an incident of parricide occurred in the jurisdiction of Jiading County. The county magistrate, feeling inadequate in governing the people, committed suicide out of sorrow and anxiety. We record the public sentiment as follows: Initially, the position of magistrate of Jiading County was vacant, and Qi Jueshi from Dongming Prefecture, Jiangxi Province, was appointed. Later, he was transferred, and Liu Maosheng, a prefect named Lv Fen, was appointed to act on his behalf. Although the prefect had advanced through grain donation, he was known for his literary talent. His monthly assignments in the province were consistently ranked at the top, and his superiors valued him for his character. Having acted as magistrate of the county for three months, he was competent in his duties. However, a report came from the village regarding a case of a nephew killing his uncle. He ordered the local officials to await inspection the following morning. In the evening, he still put on his official attire and ascended to the court to interrogate other cases. At the third drumbeat (around midnight), he retired to a quiet room, dismissed his attendants, and widened his door. People did not think much of it. Later, a loud cry was heard. His servant, suspicious, peered in and found no sound. He knocked on the door but received no response. He gathered others and broke down the door, only to find the prefect kneeling upright on the ground, fully dressed in official attire, holding a small pair of scissors in his right hand. Blood streamed from his throat, and he was cold to the touch. The incident was immediately reported to the assistant magistrate, who was at a loss. A formal report was sent to the governor of Taicang Prefecture, requesting that a neighboring official be appointed to investigate. The prefect's family, upon hearing the news, rushed from the province. It is reported that, as the investigation has not been completed, the body cannot yet be prepared for burial. Those who discuss the art of geomancy say that the Jiading County office is unfavorable to officials. In recent years, officials have either died of illness, left due to worry, experienced the death of a spouse or child, or suffered career setbacks. Now, Prefect Liu has committed suicide due to a case of parricide. People lament his misfortune and further blame the inauspicious nature of the office.</p>

<p>Random Thoughts on the Responsibilities of Teachers by Jin Guang</p>
<p>A teacher's mouth is like a magic flute to middle and primary school students, who are at their most impressionable. The teacher blows east, and the students follow east; the teacher blows west, and the students follow west. Students regard their teachers' words as if they were imperial decrees.</p>
<p>When I was in primary school, I heard the teacher talk about China's rich resources, and I felt that I had to dedicate myself to becoming a mining engineer to save the country. Later, I learned from the teacher about China's vast territory and the scarcity of railway lines, and I changed my mind, thinking that I should become a railway engineer instead. Finally, seeing China's backwardness in science, and after hearing a few words from the teacher, I wanted to study physics and chemistry. I know many people who decided on the direction of their life's work in middle and primary school, and the standard for their decision was often a few words from their teachers.</p>
<p>It is evident that a teacher's responsibility is not trivial.</p>
<p>Chinese people use the term "misleading the children" to describe bad teachers, and the word "children" often refers specifically to "other people's" families and clans, reflecting a narrow family-oriented concept. In today's world, we should no longer view it this way. The students misled by today's teachers are not just the children of other families and clans, but the children of our own country, the children of society.</p>
<p>Therefore, the responsibility of today's teachers is even greater.</p>
<p>Educational Advice: A Few Observations to the Shanghai School Authorities by Yue Gao</p>
<p>Time flies so quickly; since the Ministry's order changed the date of Teacher's Day last year, today is once again the annual Teacher's Day. As the days pass by bitterly, Shanghai's environment seems to become increasingly unbearable. Yes, our educational field is filled inside and out with persecution and suffocation. The school authorities have been working hard to cope for the past three years, and it has indeed been difficult. However, we have always been mindful of the mission entrusted to us and the responsibility entrusted to us by the nation and the country. We dare not say that we have done our best under the current circumstances. In fact, there are many areas where we have not done enough, and we tremble at the thought that we may have unintentionally harmed our country and our nation in some way! Many of us have not properly cultivated the next generation, as entrusted to us by the nation. Some have even taken the parents' hard-earned money without fulfilling their earnest hopes of educating their children! Taking advantage of this annual holiday, I would like everyone to reflect and deeply examine themselves!</p>
<p>The environment in Shanghai may get worse, and the school authorities will naturally have to cope even more arduously. However, there are many affairs and facilities that concern the schools themselves. For example, when enrolling new students, it seems that many schools have adopted the attitude of "the more, the better," without a prescribed enrollment limit and without paying attention to test scores. Everyone who takes the test is admitted, which has led to a year-by-year decline in student performance! If a student does not pay attention to his studies on a regular basis and fails the exam, he will be held back a grade. If he transfers to another school, he can advance a grade. If this happens again the following year, he can transfer to another school again and advance a grade. As a result, he graduates after changing schools several times. Therefore, many schools have no repeaters. However, at the beginning of a semester, the academic performance of some secondary school students can be two or three years behind. This is the first point. Second, in order to increase revenue, schools have been endlessly increasing the number of students in each class to the point where there is no space in the classroom, not even enough for the teachers to walk around, let alone go to the back of the classroom to guide or inspect the students. Some classes have more than ninety students, and the school authorities probably understand the impact on the effectiveness of the classes, but they have not made any improvements. Third, regarding the treatment of teachers, everyone knows that the cost of living in Shanghai is so high that the meager salaries cannot cope. If the authorities' income is not low, I hope that teachers' salaries can also be increased. Finally, I hope that the school authorities will pay close attention to the attitude towards students and the connection between teachers and students. If the students have any academic organizations, the authorities should not only not hinder them, but should also try to meet their demands as much as possible, correctly guide them, and inspire them, so that they are interested in academic research, recognize their own position, and help them solve problems, so that teachers, students, and schools are integrated in terms of academics and emotions. In this way, the students will naturally love their schools wholeheartedly, and the schools will naturally flourish.</p>
<p>Although the environment in Shanghai is bad, we can still do many things, especially since we have a mission entrusted to us by society and the country.</p>
<p>A Professional Teacher's Experience by Zhu Zheng Yang</p>
<p>In my twenty years of teaching, I have probably had no fewer than three thousand students. Some have already achieved success in the field of education, and some have gained specialized knowledge and returned from abroad. Of course, some are impoverished and dependent on others for a living, and some are surrounded by children, dedicating themselves to being virtuous wives and mothers. But, in front of Confucius, how dare I boast? Let me share some of my experiences as a teacher.</p>
<p>Self-Learning - Teachers are not necessarily capable of everything, nor do they know everything, but they cannot say "I don't know" to their students. Therefore, in my twenty years of teaching, I have spent most of my time learning myself. Before and after class, I first make sure that I understand the questions that students want to know and should know, and then I go on stage. I dare not adopt the attitude of those old teachers who pick up a book and go straight into the classroom. Therefore, I feel that I have learned more during my teaching career than I did as a student. The saying "teaching and learning reinforce each other" is truly a profound truth.</p>
<p>A Teacher in Class, A Friend Out of Class - "Teachers deserve respect," that's right, but that doesn't mean putting on a fierce face to make students afraid, but rather making students respect you from the bottom of their hearts. For example, you know more than they do, and you are also very eager to learn, keeping up with the times, creating an atmosphere of learning. You understand their lives very well, and you not only teach them books, but also guide them in their lives. In this way, students will naturally respect you. Therefore, my relationship with students is "a teacher in class, a friend out of class." Outside of class time, I play and chat with them, treating them as friends. In this way, it is easier to understand each other, easier to get close to each other, and easier to achieve results. My students, it is said, are all afraid of me, and are afraid even when I just look at them, but none of them have not become good friends.</p>
<p>Don't Be a Teacher Who Does Everything - Some teachers are eloquent, lecturing incessantly from beginning to end, but how many students listen attentively? In my class, I will never allow students to listen passively. At the very least, I want them to use their brains, answer questions, and sometimes even do some physical exercises to change the atmosphere. Some knowledge must be discovered by them themselves! Let others criticize me as much as they want, I have many tricks, but as long as it is beneficial to the students and reasonable for education, why should we be teachers who do everything inefficiently?</p>

<p>The Homecoming of the Dancing Queen by Cheng Xiaoqing</p>
<p>Chapter Six: A Dangerous Experience</p>
<p>I thought to myself that he was indeed an intellectual, clearly understanding the order of the law. But for an intellectual youth to degenerate to this point, I couldn't help but feel a sense of indescribable sadness.</p>
<p>Ni Jinshou replied: "Warrant? Not yet. We are still in the investigation stage. Please come to the police station to answer a few questions."</p>
<p>He said with a sneer: "Invite me? With a gun?"</p>
<p>Ni Jinshou said: "This is self-defense. What's in your pocket?" He patted the outside of the pocket of his black wool coat with his left hand. "Let's go."</p>
<p>He pondered for a moment, then nodded and walked towards the parked car. The car door was not closed, and Ni Jinshou rushed ahead of him and got into the car first. I followed behind Yu Gantang. His seat in the car was between us. After the car started, all three of us remained silent. After two or three minutes, he seemed to have given it careful consideration before forming a short question.</p>
<p>"On what grounds are you arresting me?"</p>
<p>Ni Jinshou seemed unwilling to answer in the car. After waiting for a while, he replied equally briefly. "You know what you've done."</p>
<p>Yu Gantang did not answer again, but his eyes were fixed on the back of the driver's head, as if he were trying to think hard. I was sitting close to him, and the smell of hair cream mixed with sweat was unpleasantly pungent. I thought to myself that although he was a university student, and in the eyes of most people, he was an intellectual and a future social leader, since most of his mental time was spent on makeup, dancing, and socializing with the opposite sex, his grades must be predictable. Then, can such a youth really be a leader of society? Alas! (88)</p>
<p>Essays</p>
<p>Being a Teacher by Kai Ren</p>
<p>In the three years of war, all aspects of China have been continuously and rapidly progressing, but the progress of the education sector has been slow, even regressing. This is undeniably a disgrace to the education sector, and this disgrace should not be hidden away as a family scandal that should not be made public. On the contrary, those in the education sector should actively work to wash it away.</p>
<p>This year's Teacher's Day has arrived! It has special significance. It is not only a day off for teachers, but also an opportunity for reflection! In the more than three years of the war of resistance, what contributions have teachers made? (Of course, I do not deny that many teachers are constantly working hard) Many people have gone astray due to mental distress and the pressure of life, frequenting gambling dens, dog racing tracks, drinking, playing mahjong, and even smoking opium. In the classroom, they are dignified "teachers," but back home, they are a different person. For the teachers themselves, this is a fall from grace; for the students, these people without a teacher's character are not worthy of being teachers. Teachers not only ruin themselves, but also ruin countless sincere youths. How can they bear it? There is another group of teachers who do not follow the right path themselves, but are jealous of others. As a result, two consequences arise: one is that they cause friends who usually work hard and teach seriously to go astray, and the other is that they provoke, attack, and slander others, making it impossible for good teachers to survive, unless you go along with the tide of corruption. In this situation, teachers must not only improve themselves, but also assimilate others.</p>
<p>Here, I would like to offer everyone a few suggestions. Teachers should be "role models." We must set an example for our students:</p>
<p>(1) In the negative aspect - do not engage in mindless pastimes, do not say one thing and do another, do not frequent places of depravity, do not mislead students, do not be jealous of others, do not do anything harmful to the public, do not be selfish, and do not hinder the progress of others.</p>
<p>(2) In the positive aspect - cultivate young students, guide them in the right direction, teach diligently and responsibly, do not only care about your own comfort and ignore the students, read some useful books in order to add to the teaching material, and you can also introduce them to the students, which is beneficial to both parties. You can also raise the questions in the book and discuss them with your colleagues, exchange opinions, and come to the correct conclusions. Study closely in group life, and do more activities that are beneficial to the mind and body.</p>

<p>On Errors in Opera Lyrics by Jun Mei</p>
<p>(1)</p>
<p>In recent years, Peking opera has made considerable improvements in phonology, instruments, stage design, costumes, etc. Although opinions vary, and there is both praise and criticism, the intention to correct and innovate is not entirely unjustified. However, little attention has been paid to the lyrics. Performers, due to ingrained habits, adhere to their schools and factions. Even if they are aware of the errors, they are unwilling to correct them themselves. Thus, they are passed down through generations, as if they were set in stone, with an "error all the way" mentality!</p>
<p>(2)</p>
<p>Errors in opera lyrics are nothing more than omissions, inversions, ambiguities, and mistakes. Although their impact on the entire opera is negligible, a single word or phrase can often leave people confused. For example, in the opera "Empty City Stratagem," the lines "Discussing yin and yang is as easy as turning one's hand to ensure the universe," and "Conquering the east, suppressing the north, widely knowledgeable and versed in the present and the past" are poorly connected in meaning to the entire sentence, especially the last four words of each sentence. The error is likely due to inversion. If they were changed to "Discussing yin and yang is as easy as turning one's hand, widely knowledgeable and versed in the present and the past," and "Conquering the east, suppressing the north, ensuring the universe," the meaning of the lyrics would be consistent and understandable. Everyone knows this. However, because this opera is considered Tan Xinpei's masterpiece, whether one is a disciple of Tan's school or not, no one dares to change a single word! Another example is "Selling the Horse," where Qin Qiong sings "Scolding Qin Qiong is blind, taking bandits as guests, dragging the shopkeeper lazily, in this way, we both abandon it." The rhyme changes three times in the four-sentence passage, and previous scholars have pointed this out. However, the singers do not object! In fact, Tan Xinpei's acting skills were extremely refined. Such errors would not have been overlooked. According to Lao Dan, Tan Xinpei liked to play tricks to make it difficult for those who learned from him to grasp his techniques. So, how can we know that Tan Xinpei did not intentionally invert or reverse them on occasion? This is a ridiculous imitation of previous people's errors!</p>

<p>As for the lyrics that do not match the plot, a single error can change the entire meaning. In "White Liang Pass," Yu Chigong is clearly wearing black armor and a black helmet, but Xiao Hei sings "Another heroic family is coming, without helmet and armor, with embroidered团花 on a black silk robe." This leaves the audience feeling baffled. In fact, when examining the original lyrics, it is "black oil helmet and black oil armor, with embroidered团花 on a black oil robe," which has no contradiction with the plot. I have also seen a famous actor singing "A Pinch of Snow," where Mo Cheng sings "Snow's wife is crying on the side." Whether Snow's wife is Snow's wife or not is not important, but it is clear that Snow's name is not Snow, so she cannot be called Snow's wife. However, the singer sings and the audience listens, without any objections. This is also a strange thing!</p>

<p>As for the lyrics that are so erroneous that they cannot be understood, there is nothing more obvious than "Eight Great Hammers." When Lu Wenlong enters the stage, he says, "Where should I put 元尧 to disappoint, how long will I drift?" The poem in the scene says, "One is missing in the blue and green painting, empty mountains, water and wood drift, the Yangtze River waves surge, the seawater seems to surge." The lyrics are so fragmented that even with embellishment, it is difficult to know where to</p>
<h3>Cotton Trade: Slight Increase in Activity</h3>
<p>Spot cotton trading has seen a slight increase in activity. Factories remain quiet, but trading among merchants is lively due to rising yarn prices, leading to increased speculation.</p>
<p>Tongzhou: 171.0, Sanyi (firm name) purchased 150 bales</p>
<p>Shangyu: 188.0, Yuancheng (firm name) purchased 250 bales</p>
<p>Huishi Deng: 208.0, Qingsheng (firm name) purchased 200 pieces</p>

<p>Foreign Cotton Market Report: The New York cotton market was active from the beginning. Increased buying from spot traders and fellow merchants resulted in closing prices rising by 0.13 pounds per point compared to the previous day. India, along with forecasts, fell by one rupee.</p>
<p>Shanghai Foreign Cotton Trading: Yesterday, the Shanghai foreign cotton market was initially affected by tightening exchange rates. Later, Japanese manufacturers aggressively bought spot goods, but limited inventory resulted in only a few thousand pieces traded. It is generally expected that cotton prices will continue to rise after customs clearance, based on today's trading trends.</p>
<h3>Grains: Kunshan New Top Grade Rice Arrives on the Market; Foreign Rice Rises and Falls</h3>
<p>Foreign rice prices fluctuated yesterday due to rumors of resumed transportation between Ningbo and Shanghai, as well as various other rumors concerning the Nanyang (Southeast Asia) issue. Moreover, the previous day was a Sunday holiday, so demand doubled yesterday. Not only were mainland merchants actively procuring rice from their hometowns, but local shops were also eager to stock up, leading to a generally active market. Prices temporarily rose by about half a yuan. First-grade old Saigon rice was quoted at 60 yuan, and "fire-twisted" (high-quality) at 59 yuan. Second-grade Saigon rice was at 54.5 yuan, and small-twisted at 54 yuan. Original-package Yinghua (firm name) Siamese second-grade rice, stored in bank warehouses, opened at 64.5 yuan. Second-grade Saigon rose from 62.8 to 63.1 yuan. Subsequently, Ningbo merchants arrived in Shanghai with rice, and local shops began to sell, but no further increases occurred. Speculators rushed to cash in their profits, resulting in supply exceeding demand, and prices fell again. While some prices still saw increases of two or three jiao, the situation can be considered stable. First-grade old Saigon rice was priced at 59 yuan, second-grade at 53.5 yuan and 53 yuan. First-grade Siamese was at 59 yuan and 58.5 yuan, second-grade at 52.7 and 52.3 yuan. Fire-twisted was at 58 yuan. Hong Kong top grade was at 57.5 yuan and 56 yuan, middle grade at 55 yuan, second grade at 52.5 and 52 yuan. Small-twisted top grade was at 53.3 yuan and 53 yuan. Tokyo glutinous top grade was from 50 yuan, and second grade was at 48 yuan. Coarse glutinous was at 47-48 yuan, broken glutinous at 43-44 yuan, and rice tea at 45-46 yuan. Daily spot rice transactions totaled 7,000 bags, while original-package rice was around 200 tons.</p>
<p>A small quantity of foreign rice, 519 bags, arrived in Shanghai yesterday on the Jardine Matheson &amp; Co.'s Ming Sheng steamer from Hong Kong. It arrived at the Rossevelt Wharf on the evening of the 25th and was unloaded.</p>
<p>Seven to eight hundred bags of japonica and glutinous domestic rice arrived. Market rumors indicated that the rise in foreign rice prices during the early morning trading session caused a corresponding increase in domestic rice prices. However, the prices later declined slightly. Nevertheless, due to the limited amount of domestic rice arriving, sellers were strongly holding onto their inventory and refusing to lower prices. As a result, selling prices were about half a yuan higher than the previous week. Changzhou fresh pure japonica was at 67-68 yuan, Wuxi pure japonica at around 66 yuan, Changzhou Su Kun japonica was high at 65-66 yuan, lower grade at 61-62 yuan, Bo Dao Su at 62.5 yuan, Nangang original package early rice at 63.5 yuan and 63 yuan, wholesale price at 62.5 to 60.05 yuan. Glutinous rice Li Jin special grade was around 62 yuan, Chang Dan white grade at 60.05 to 59 yuan, Hong Kong special grade at 62 yuan and 61.5 yuan, ordinary at 60 yuan and 59 yuan, common grade at 54-55 yuan.</p>
<p>Only thirty to forty dan of Zhoupu new japonica rice arrived. Sales were quite good, and the price increased by half a yuan, opening at 62.5 yuan and 62 yuan. Kunshan new mutton fat (top grade) rice has also arrived on the market, with approximately eighteen dan sold after being milled by Zhengda Factory. The rice quality is excellent and was well-received. Wholesale prices opened at 60 yuan per dan.</p>
<h3>After the Influx of Foreign Wheat, Fuxin Starts Production for the Market</h3>
<p>Flour: The flour market was generally lackluster yesterday. Since the arrival of foreign flour and wheat last week, people have become somewhat apprehensive. However, local flour mills still saw decent sales during the Mid-Autumn Festival season. Fuxin Mill, having received foreign wheat, has reportedly begun production to supply the market. The total quantity of flour released by domestic mills was approximately 5,000 bags. There was no resale of newly arrived foreign flour, and there was little movement in domestic flour. However, the futures price for the Japanese mill's Green Phoenix brand for October delivery was 14.9 yuan for 6,000-7,000 bags, the same as the previous weekend. There was no spot market for this month. Spot prices are at 14.6 yuan, and the market is showing signs of weakness.</p>
<p>Wheat: New wheat trading remained limited yesterday. Due to the arrival of foreign wheat at both Chinese and Japanese mills, although there was demand for raw materials, mills were unwilling to offer favorable prices. Merchants remained stable in their thinking and were not in a rush to sell, making it difficult for prices to rise or fall. Chinese mills purchased only small quantities, ranging from several dozen to one or two hundred bags. Japanese mills also purchased only two or three thousand bags, with prices secretly discounted by three to five jiao.</p>
<h3>Oil Cakes: Raw Oil Rises Again</h3>
<p>Peanut Oil Market: After the turnaround on Saturday last week, the market continued its upward trend yesterday, driven by optimistic sentiment. Overall, the market situation is unique, and speculative forces are difficult to suppress, causing market fluctuations to deviate from the normal course. Only 50 pieces of Jiaozhou spot raw oil were traded (at 63 yuan), while term trading was extremely active, with a total of over 1,700 pieces traded: 500 pieces for delivery in the second half of September (at 60 to 61 yuan) and over 1,300 pieces for delivery in the first half of October (at 61 yuan). Twenty barrels of Qingdao spot raw oil were traded at 89 to 89.5 yuan, and 50 barrels of "road cargo" (cargo in transit) were opened at 88 yuan. Soybean oil was in a passive position and remained stable. Forty barrels of Dalian oil were traded at 97 to 97.5 yuan. Dayou Factory oil was all "leather ball" business (transactions with no real delivery), with 250 dan traded at 75 yuan for new warehouse receipts and 74 yuan for old warehouse receipts, and 20 barrels of Pudong Factory oil traded at 75.5 yuan. (Today is Confucius' birthday, and the market is closed as usual). Three hundred cans of soybean oil were shipped from Qingdao yesterday, and 143 bags of sesame seeds and 590 cans of raw oil were shipped to Hong Kong today.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Sugar Prices Show Little Fluctuation</h3>
<p>Yesterday, raw white sugar saw slight decreases based on reports from production areas. Dutch reports were 10.375, 10.25, and 10.125. Hong Kong reports were 24.50 to 24.00. Prices set by the association remained stable. Spot No. 24 raw white new goods in local warehouses were unchanged at 74.2 yuan. Old goods rose five jiao to 73.5 yuan. Re-export goods were also tight, with September 6th delivery at 60 yuan. Dutch cotton white TML mark was at 73 yuan. Dutch red mark was at 64 yuan for goods in local warehouses, and 63.5 yuan for spot goods. Goods en route, arriving around September 6th, were at 61.5 yuan. Taikoo's (sugar company) refined white was softer, with L mark at 74 yuan. Small triangle and HX marks remained at 69.5 yuan. The domestic Jianbang sugar company offered over 300 bags of dirty green sugar at 64 yuan. Other transactions were scarce.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Export of Local Red Tea Slightly Revives</h3>
<p>The sale of green tea yesterday remained sluggish, with no significant improvement expected due to disruptions in the Moroccan market caused by the ongoing Mediterranean war. However, local red tea, handled by firms such as Jardine Matheson, Jinlong, and Goodfellow &amp; Co., has seen some activity. The market was slightly more active than before, with over 600 chests traded at prices ranging from 220 to 285 yuan. Although there were scattered negotiations for Phoenix Eyebrow and Pearl Tea items, no transactions occurred. The market situation remains bleak.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Speculators Revive, Cloth Prices Suddenly Rise</h3>
<p>Domestic Cloth: The cloth market rose sharply yesterday. Increased hopes for the resumption of shipping to Zhejiang and Fujian, coupled with the frequent rise of yarn prices, significantly stimulated the market. Wholesalers buying to cover their short positions, and both internal and external speculators entered the market. Absorption of dyed and gray cloth by local merchants increased suddenly. As a result, the sale price of white, bleached, and dyed cloth all rose by 0.25 to 0.75 yuan per piece. Over 1,000 pieces of various fabrics were traded in the local market. In addition to reporting and loading previously contracted goods, Zhejiang and Fujian merchants saw few new deals. Guangdong and Hong Kong merchants procured over one hundred pieces of twill-weave colored cloth, merchants from the north road of Yantai and Tianjin purchased over two hundred pieces, and merchants from Nanyang Singapore and other places purchased over five thousand pieces of colored cloth, colored twill, etc. Today, 215 pieces of piece goods were shipped to Yantai, and 178 pieces were shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Eastern Cloth: Yesterday, with various positive news reports favoring the bulls, local merchants and speculators increased their buying. White goods, particularly "Dragon Head" fine cloth, closed at 32.65 yuan in the morning and continued to rise in the afternoon, reaching 32.2 yuan. Four Gentlemen serge was offered at a peak price of 0.945 yuan, but retreated slightly at closing to 0.94375 yuan. Mid-range fine cloth continued to rise, increasing by 0.75 to 1 yuan per piece, showing a particularly strong trend.</p>
