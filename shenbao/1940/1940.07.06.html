<h3 id="c13">如何救濟民食 <a href="#c13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>物價波折奔騰，滬上居民之生活，迄今猶在嚴重過程中，未獲稍舒喘息之機會；如六月分上海工人生活費指數，仍行上騰，造成百分之四二二，九一之最高紀錄。言其原因，又爲米價飛漲之自然結果。夫今日上海米價之高漲，固非關於供求之不相稱，而由於人爲之操縱。彼之所以敢於操縱，自有其所利用，所憑藉，所勾結，微論其資力，不容輕侮，即觀其不顧一切，悍然無忌，其氣魄必非偶然也，茲舍操縱而談供求，雖至今猶未見上海存米有可靠之調查統計，足資引證；但就本報逐日所載洋米進口報吿計之，已不在少數；又就各方探訪所得，謂若上海存米禁止外運，足敷新穀登塲前之需求而有餘，蓋路貨固不在少，續訂之米爲數亦鉅；以供上海民食之需，固不虞其不足也。</p>
<p>就統計所指示，以論一般之生活，僅見其輪廓之邊緣，未見其內涵之悽慘，蓋非身受者，不易得悉其所遭際之艱苦。間嘗聞之工人言，工作竟日，得工資一元四五角，買米二升，已去其一元有零；所買之米，不但碎粒甚多，中已不知且攙米粞，用以煮飯，似粥而稍堅，猶不夠家人一飽，兒女啼饑，父母心碎，然而血汗盡於此矣。往者，上海嘗有幾度爲糧價高漲，發生騷擾，但近來米價空前之貴，却尠聞由米價而發生之治安問題，此非力足以負担之證，要亦顧及環境，體諒租界當局處境之非昔比，故髯願忍饑挨餓以待當局之有爲耳。惟其然，斯當局尤應洞燭民隱，解民倒懸：務使米價不爲奸商所把持操縱而得恢復正常；務使市塲以外無行盤，行盤以外無暗盤。此則有賴於市塲管理之得力，及評價手續之嚴密。今雖有米糧評價委員會成立之說，但其成效如何，猶待事實作證明。蓋評價委員會成立之後，辦理有方，固可以消除暗盤，使市價上落，有塗轍之可尋。不得其道，仍爲米業作城狐社鼠之憑藉，則太阿倒持，轉使米價無復有平準之可能。故於民食之爲禍爲福，要在監督管制能吾不徒托空言也，茲所當知者，限價與評價之時效，各有其限度。限價之爲效，僅能濟一時之急，不能持久，故其結果勢必發生暗盤，反致無法限制。評價之爲用，使市價重復歸於公開，而暗盤得以消滅，暗盤去，則行市歸於一；既公開，則操縱抬價，當有所顧忌，即如「搶帽子」「皮球」之一類交易或可稍事歛跡。於是米價上下，可望隨供求而作進退。然此所裨益於民食者爲效甚僅，蓋其最大限度之作用，無非使大衆出正常之價格。獲得相當之米糧，至欲使米價平落，造福市民去此尙遠。</p>
<p>夫爲大多數貧苦民衆救急之計，自惟有辦理較大規模，較能持久之平糶。古昔舉辦平糶，開倉發穀，故能爲市塲上增添大宗糧食，而耀價可不受市價過度之拘束：非若今之平耀仍當購之於市塲而以轉耀於民也。惟亦有可道者，則平耀米例得免　，自較一般米糧之進本爲低；升斗如求其不虧，則米糧將不無折耗，此則有待於各界捐款，或公家補助以爲之彌補。且辦理糶振，亦當爲大多數糶買求便利，故地點宜多不宜少，宜散不宜集。貧民爲貪此升斗之便宜，延頸佇企於赤日驕陽之下，情劇可憐，故升合宜整飭，不宜剝蝕，米質宜認眞不宜攙雜。凡此嘉惠於窮黎，惟視辦理其事者之實心實力何如耳！</p>
<p>顧米糧之回復正常行市，與平糶之爲小民减輕苦痛，果得實行，似可稍爲民食問題解決一部分之困難，但非對整個民食有漸進改善之圖，則民生仍無復蘇之望。蘇息民生，似非可遽期之於租界當局，然懲處米蠧，固租界當局權威能力之所可及也。</p>

<p>余旣以讀摯之悲痛、不得不向下院宣佈吾人必須採行以免法艦隊落於敵手之計劃、兩個國家在莊嚴同盟下、對共同敵人駢肩作戰時、一國容可因精力疲竭、爲勢所迫、不得不請其同盟國免除其義務、吾人所可望於法政府之最小程度、爲法政府於放棄戰爭而將全部重量加諸英國之時、當審愼勿以非必要之傷害施諸其　忠實同盟國、致妨碍法國自由、惟此是賴之英國最後勝利、下院當可記憶，吾人會尤解除法人所負之條約義務、而附以一個條件、卽法艦隊應在單獨休戰談判完成以前、駛入英國海港是、法國未依此爲之、法艦隊總司令達蘭雖曾對英國海相等作種種之私人諾言與保證、然休戰議定卒已簽字、而將法艦隊置於德義權力之中、與十日前不及開往非洲口岸而駛入樸資茅斯與濮萊茅斯兩港的其他法艦之入於英國權力中同樣有效、波繭多政府明知此事之後果與其對於吾人之危險、乃在放棄盟約取消協定之際、竟拒絕英國之籲請、其所加於英國之傷害爲如何重大、此乃余所不能不置諸紀錄者也、尙有一事可謂爲無情或惡意的待遇者、此種待遇非出自從未與聞此事之法國民族、但出自波爾多政府、此事維何、則幽禁於法國之被俘德飛行員四百餘人、多係英空軍擊落者、法前總理萊諾曾尤解交英倫收管、但萊諾旣倒、卽交還德國是已、波爾多政府此舉無疑的欲博取德國之歡心、（而絕不顧及加諸吾人之傷害、當德空軍極感高級駕駛員之缺乏時、而波爾多政府竟交回精駕駛衛之四百餘人、明知彼等將肆虐於英國、而將勞英空軍再度擊落之、此不亦更屬可恨乎、此種謬舉、余知歷史決不恕之、余信法人終將奮起以掃蕩此汚點而復其民族榮譽、</p>
<p>堅決行動　自救救人</p>
<p>上週余會謂吾人現須對於吾人之自教、予以特殊注意、余一身經騐中、從未在內閣討論時見有悲痛傷感之問題、如關於處置法艦隊者、吾人職當進行之辦法、其理由至爲堅强、故　員全體皆有何者應爲之同樣信心，毫無猶豫或意見相左、軍事閣員十二人、以及情報部大臣與對法友好最爲著聞之殖民部太臣、於商討此事時、皆覺除此辦法而外、別無他策、吾人乃以悲痛之情緒與明顯之觀察、一致成立此項決定、於是昨晨在各種準備完成後、將法艦隊之一大部份置於吾人統制之下、或使之依從吾人需要、法戰艦與輕巡艦各二·潛艇若干·內有巨型潛艇「塞柯夫」號及小型而極有用之掃雷艦等　約二百艘大部怕於樸資茅斯港者、皆於英方以簡短通吿送交各艦長後、由英兵登艦收管矣、除「塞柯夫」號大潛艇因誤會發生衝突、致登艦英軍官一、與水兵二、及法軍官一殞命、又雙方各傷一人外、餘皆順利進行、未有反抗與流血、法水兵泰半欣然接受此不定的時期之結束、同時表示對德賡續作戰之熱切願望者達八九百人、並有請入英國籍者、吾人準備尤其請、而對於其他數千法人、願以法人資格作戰者亦不加歧視、餘者俟法政府得德方統治者之同意能歡迎其返國時、卽遣回法境、英境內之法兵除自願投效特戈爾將軍麾下從事救國工作者外、吾人亦將遣回之、法潛艇數艘已自動加入英艦隊、而吾人已接受其服務、地中海之亞力山大利亞港中駐有英國强大艦隊、而法國戰艦一巡艦四、裝置八吋口徑砲新式軍艦三、及小型艦若干、亦泊於其旁、今彼等已接到不許擅自離港致入於法國征服者權力中之通知、談判與討論當然已在進行中、其詳情無庸爲下院吿、目前已採取方法、務使法艦非沉沒海中、卽依從吾人志願、今晨義機空襲亞力山大利亞者、若干法艦亦對於共同之敵人開砲猛擊、卽此一事、吾人可想見英法海軍人員對於處分法艦事在精神上所感之痛苦爲何如矣、吾人對於亞力山大利亞之法國將士願繼續作戰者加以便利、予以給養至戰事完畢而後止、餘者吾人亦願遣之返法、而在彼等離亞力山大利亞時、吾人當盡力照料以保其安全、</p>
<p>此事中之最嚴重部份今仍存在、法海軍最優軍艦「鄧扣克」號與「斯特拉斯堡」號兩艘、乃新式戰鬥巡洋艦較德艦「香霍斯脫」號與「格尼森諾」號爲優、今與戰艦兩艘輕巡艦數艘及驅逐艦潛艇等各若干、泊於北非摩洛哥海岸之沃朗港中、昨晨英方遴選前充駐巴黎海軍隨員之賀蘭上校、乘驅逐艦往見法艦隊司令、但被拒不接受、賀蘭乃留下公文一件、</p>
<p>提出通牒　竟遭拒絕</p>
<p>此公文之內容、余不妨向下院誦之、其三段言休戰問題、此後文曰、「前此與君同志之吾　、決不能容許君所統帶之軍艦落於德義權力中、吾輩決計作戰到底、若吾輩勝利果如所料、吾人決不忘却法國原爲吾輩之與國、而吾輩之利益亦卽法國之利益、蓋吾人共同仇敵乃德國也、吾輩莊重聲朋、吾輩果勝、吾輩將恢復法國之偉大與土地、爲此之故、吾輩必須使法國漲軍之最好軍艦、不爲此共同仇敵所利用以制吾人、英政府在此種環境中、飭余要求駐於沃朗港之法艦隊、依照下列辦法之一而行、（甲）偕吾輩駛出仍對德義作戰以求勝利、（乙）酌留艦員在吾輩監視下駛往英國口岸、而所留艦員可儘速遣回法國、以上兩項如採用其一、則英國願於戰事結束時、將此軍艦交還法國、如受損壞、英國願完全賠償、（丙）如君以爲除非德義破壞休戰協定、不應以法艦攻擊德義、則法艦可酌留艦員隨吾輩駛往西印度之法屬口岸、如瑪丁尼克等處、法艦在該處可照吾輩滿意之程度解除武裝、或交托美國保管、以待戰局之結果、而艦員可遣回、士述公尤辦法如君拒絕之、則余不得不以深切憾忱、請君於六小時內自沉各艦、否則余奉有英政府之訓令、將以吾輩可認爲必要之武力阻止各法艦落於敵手、」（衆大歡呼）、</p>
<p>吾人本希望其所提出之辦法、法方可接受其一、而無使用英國戰艦隊可怖的武力之必要、詎知不然、而英艦隊遂於賀蘭上校出發兩小時後、出現於沃朗之前、統帶此艦隊者爲索末維爾海軍中將、其人近在鄧扣克撤兵時、曾載出法人十萬餘衆、功績著聞、除戰艦外並有巡艦與驅逐艦各若干供其指揮、磋議終日、吾人午前猶抱可接受吾人條件而不流血之希望、但法司令無疑的遵守維斯已登德人所指使之命令、拒不就範、而以願意決戰爲言、是以英政府諭令索末維爾中將在薄慕前完成其任務、午後三時五十八分、英艦乃向此强有力而亦爲岸上砲隊所保護之法艦隊開砲轟擊、六時英司令報告正在交戰中、英飛機母艦「王家奥克」號亦猛烈助戰、七時廿分、英司令又來報吿、據謂「斯特拉斯堡級之巡洋戰艦一艘受傷擱淺、尙有「白里太格」級戰艦兩艘一沉一傷、又法驅透艦兩艘與飛機母艦一艘沉沒或被焚毀、當此可悲的戰事正在進行時、另一巡洋戰艦「斯特拉斯堡」號或「鄧扣克」號設法離港、以期駛往都隆或北非某口岸、而遵照波爾多政府休戰條件、自處於德國統制之下、惟艦員等或未知之耳、英艦隊之飛機曾進擊之、該艦至少被一魚雷擊中、惟該艦或已與夜間由阿爾吉里亞駛出之法艦數艘連絡、而能駛抵都隆、爲吾人所不能追及、此「鄧扣克」號旣已受傷、在數月內將不能出戰、</p>
<p>嘲義海軍　袖手旁觀</p>
<p>法艦雖爲不天然之原因而戰、然戰時具有法海軍特性之勇敢、此乃無待余言者、法司令與其屬員、自覺必須遵守其政府在德方指使下而發之命令、吾人對之必須予以種種原諒、余恐法人中與海港中生命之損失勢必頗鉅、因吾人被迫使用甚劇烈之武力，並聞數度大爆炸也、此役英艦未有在砲力上或行動上受對方猛烈砲火之影響者、余尙未接關於英方傷亡之報吿惟索末維爾海軍中將所統帶之艦隊、在軍事各點上完整無恙而準備再戰、（衆歡呼）吾人亦準備與之周旋之義國海軍、其艦數當然較戰於沃朗之英艦爲多者、竟審愼遠避、（衆大笑）但在吾人將作之戰役中以固其地中海之控制權者、義海軍終將受創也、法艦隊至是、一大部分已轉入吾人之手、或已不能參戰、或已脫離德人之權力、至於刻仍逍遙海上之法艦、則吾人對之、決計就力所能至、阻其落入德人掌握中、吾人此番行動之功罪、聽令國會判之、國民判之、美國判之、世人判之、及歷史判之、（衆大歡呼）</p>
<p>應付攻勢　充分準備</p>
<p>余至此請言最近之將來、吾人當然期待敵人之來攻、現正盡其能力作種種準備、無論敵方攻擊加於英國或愛爾蘭、吾人當有以擊潰之、愛爾蘭全體人民不間具何信仰、隸何黨派、應皆知愛爾蘭在轉瞬卽屆之危險中、吾人於此知之甚明、故自晨至夜從事布置、然公開討論此事毫無補益、卽在秘密會中、政府亦須有所保留、余請英國人民及大西洋兩岸對吾人同情者、以其極大之援助給予吾人、吾人現方偕其自治領、度極大的危險與光輝的希望之時期、凡我民族之德性皆將受試騐、此非懷疑或示弱之時期、但爲吾人應召以赴之極屬重要時期、余現欲向下院宣讀余分致在王冕下担任要職者之一文、余願欣然以此文遍送各議員供其採用、但非謂其需此勸吿、文日「首相於敵方來侵之前、願向政府中居負責地位者勉以警敏與自價之精神、任何戒備必須採行、時間與方法旣兼有之、自無可謂敵軍能從空中或海外在英登陸　、較我目前軍隊所可殲滅或擒獲之者其數更多之理由、莢空軍布置極佳力量極强、前所未有、德海軍之弱從未若今日之甚、而英國內睦軍、亦從未若今日之强、余期待各大員樹立穩定堅決之表率、對於其左右或僚屬所表示消化不良之意見、宜加以制止或譴責、苟見任何官吏有故意運用擾亂人心或挫弱人氣之勢力或發此言論者、宜立卽呈報或予以革除、如是始不愧對在海陸空抵禦敵人毫無畏怯之戰士、</p>
<p>求達勝利　決不言和</p>
<p>總之、余覺吾人應得下院之信任、（衆歡呼）各議員應相信無論吾人職責如何艱苦、吾人決不溺職、吾人業已採取之此番行動、尙足以永遠銷釋德國宣傳家在美國等處所散布及第五縱隊在英國內所造成之讕言與謠諑、彼等謂吾人有與敵議和之章、凡此種種、應可爲吾人被迫而採的悲痛而嚴厲之行動所完全掃除矣、在此篤愛和平久為人知之國內、今未有議和之念、不僅此也、吾人且欲以極大之勇力與所有之方法進行戰爭、直至吾人作戰以求之正義目的皆已實現而後已云、（五日路透電）</p>

<p>— 陳靑士</p>
<p>—爲本報大中學生暑期微文而作—</p>
<p>陳先生係公共租界工部局華人敎育處處長、他對於大中學生暑期作業、提出集體研究切身問題、選讀名著、輪流報吿、結合同志、參觀各機關、認識社會的眞相、及努力去做掃除文盲的社會服務四點、都是極有價値的提示、無論就那一點寫成的應徵文章、都是言之有物的作品、（編者）</p>
<p>學校暑假應吾廢止或縮短一問題、曾引起國內敎育界熱烈的討論、贊成者和反對者雙方各持有相當之理由、此問題姑置不論、但無論如何、我們不應讓這兩個月可貴的光陰、虛虛渡過、我想任何人都能同意的、暑期不應消磨於嬉遊之中、而應有固定的作業、我想可以從下列幾點說明、</p>
<p>·從學問上着想　學問不進即退、有人用標準測騐比較學生在放暑假時及暑假後的成績、結果是暑假後的成績較遜、這是學問不進卽退的明證、現代靑年處國家危急存亡之秋、正應發奮圖强、本自强不息的精神、求自身的發展、以爲將來服務社會國家之準備、圖享樂、求安逸、都是靑年所應切忌的、</p>
<p>二·從健康上着想　生活有紀律、作息有定時、乃保持健康的要素、學生在學校中的生活可說是合乎上述的條件、但許多人在暑假中常過着混亂的生活、起居作息、均無定時、弄得精神萎靡不振、而影響到身體的健康、這是萬分不該的、</p>
<p>然則靑年學生應該如何利用暑假、個人處境不同、機會不同、本不能有一律的規定、下面幾種作業或者可供參考、</p>
<p>一·集團研究　在現在學校制度之下、學生的時間大部分消磨於敎科書之中、而對於許多靑年切身的問題或感覺有深切興趣的問題、反無暇顧及、這本是萬分不該的、我想學生正可利用暑假、給合志趣相投的同學、組織討論會、在比較自由的環境、比較活潑的空氣中、硏究和討論道些重要問題、爲使這種討論會成功、事先對於討論的問題、討論的範圍、資料的收集、參加的人員、須定一個詳盡的計劃、以免臨時毫無準備、敷衍了事、</p>
<p>二·名著選讀　學生在學校裏終日捧着幾本敎科書、而對於許多人人應該閱讀的名著、無暇涉獵、這是很可惜的、學生正可利用暑假、在敎師指導之下、選定名著若干種、交換閱讀、掄流報吿、我想所得一定不少、</p>
<p>三·集體參觀　上海機關林立、平時被圈在學校圍牆以內的學生、正可利用暑假、組織參觀團、輪流參觀各種機關、以增加其對於社會的認識、</p>
<p>四·社會服務　在暑假中靑年學生在本分內應該做的一件社會服務工作、就是掃除文盲、我國文盲如此之多、除非全國智識階級（包括學生在內）全體動員、欲掃除文盲實無此可能、道是我們受過敎育的人對於社會應盡的義務、不可推諉的責任、</p>

<p>紗市平靜、不脫徘徊之境、但實際銷路尙稱不薄、香港雲南兩帮採辦繼續不懈、所以人心較爲穩定、市塲傳說、紗廠因天氣暑熱、自動减工、生意尙可减縮、有一部份對於棉紗籌碼短少、市面或可回升一步、加之期貨不做、市惰愈形安定耳、</p>
<p>現紗晨開因環境不良、外滙放長、黃金趨跌、二十支雙馬開價跌十元外、爲八百七十元、續跌至八百六十元、旋聞香港方面需要尙殷、人心重振、市盤徐徐上漲、至八百八十五元收盤、又說日商對於華紗裝運至華南銷售、獲利甚爲豐厚、筆者對於此事略爲探問、據某掮客云、日商洋行（式老虎）某君購二三支金鷄、大發及十支特金城約計一二百包、此貨是否裝運廣州灣、尙難斷定也、乃市塲上人心、轟動一時、查半日間成交統計二千四百二十五包、行情二十支雙馬跌二元、今日有一百三十件運香港、茲將各帮口買去之額量分列如左、</p>

<p>另訊、外棉市價、紐約棉市、昨日爲美國獨立節、全美交易所停市一天、印度棉市因投機者之購買、結果連同預測漲二羅比半、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、始終靜寂異常、市上盛傳日商在市搜購國紗、因之紗價轉昂、棉市亦有被帶起之可能也、</p>

<p>洋米大量到滬、昨日太古公司綏陽輪中午抵滬、自香港運來一萬九千二百三十九包停靠浦東本行碼頭起卸、下午二時許又有太原輪到埠、亦由香港裝來二萬零四百三十包、當停法租界外灘本行碼頭起卸、昨日兩輪共裝來洋米三萬九千六百六十九包之鉅、</p>
<p>糯米內地來源雖無、但銷塲亦以價格連日漲高、不若前日之爽、故形勢轉平、計開金溧白元仍爲六十五元、常丹白元六十三四元、不過香港糯以市貨無多、去路較廣、且素以洋米馬首是膽、猛提二元左右，開六十七元、</p>

<p>麵粉　昨現粉市况、更形堅俏、因華廠方面、以原料不敷、福新廠於昨日起突然停止供粉，僅恃阜豐獨家維持、全日間批出亦有五六千包、老車牌廠盤仍照十五元二角之原價、該廠對於民食前途、頗具熱心、惟目下新麥旣無法大量收買、洋麥雖可定購、恐將來到貨、亦須顧慮、長此以往、殊爲堪虞、聞租界當局　在設法疏通小麥運滬、恐最短期問、尙難實現、而廠粉供應、旣感不敷、內地日廠粉之傾銷機會則更佳、聞雙獅金山等粉源源運到、價在十六元一二角、期貨十六元五六角、成交各有數千包、</p>
<p>小麥　昨新麥來源、依然寥落、除某方直接辦解外、華商在各地辦成者、迄今無法運滬、故市面正式交易、一時無從開展、最近蕪湖方面、正在接洽之搬運許可證一批、亦未有正式回音、故華廠福阜兩廠、有續訂澳洲洋麥之議、合價每百斤三十元左右、</p>

<p>昨日豆餅市况，因天晴無雨、對於農作物施肥有影響、故各方辦胃感乏興趣、僅囤戶及汕頭興化內地帮仍在活動、然交易已較前减縮、致行情稍呈參差、故其潛勢暫吿轉定、統計做開大有餘四牌餅三千片、價爲十三元八角半至九角、甡記餅七千片、現貨價爲十三元一角至三角、七月上半月交爲十三元三角至三角半、元隆餅　　、價爲十三元、通州小豆餅三千片，價爲每百市斤二十元零五角、</p>

<p>東布　晨市因標金續跌、賣氣益盛、細布再見新低價、十二磅龍頭細布收盤降至二十七元六角、漸與中檔各牌軋近、四君子嗶嘰木街走銷尙佳、同業頗有吃戶、故僅跌一分、收盤八角二分半、</p>

<p>工部局正式受託於中國政府、代爲保管之土地局卷宗、終不顧華方之抗議、中外正直人士之反感、擅自交與並無合法地位之第三者、而於昨晨作張冠李戴之「移交」矣、昨日上午八時五十五分、日總領事署高級領事佐藤、携同僞「土地局局長·范某·職員陳某。及僞「市府」代表楊某·吳某、造訪工部局總辦費利溥、然後同至工部局大厦A字五〇六號房間（卽土地局卷宗密藏之處、）該室四周曾砌有墻壁、事前經局方夏工卸除）、由警務處預備隊人員監護之下、完成上海土地局卷宗有史以來最足感喟之一頁、</p>
<p>工部局之　公表消息</p>
<p>據工部局情報室發表、關于經由日本總領事之手而移交前土地局卷宗一事、已由該局於今（五日）晨實行、移交事宜、迄中午全部吿竣、</p>
<p>追溯往事　如在目前</p>
<p>「移交」工作、於上午九時十五分開始、至十二時十五分、始吿畢事、上海市長兪鴻鈞氏前將此項宗卷交託工部局時、係以十九輛卡車搬運者、所耗費之時間、達三夜之久、卽一九三七年十一月二十九·三十日及十二月十一日、今日該項卷宗「移交」之際、捕房人員百餘、由司密斯氏領導、俱守衛於工部局大厦、而卡車上則由俄捕及印捕負保護之責、日方僅由特務隊派佐藤參加、新聞記者前往攝影者、均被禁止、惟潛行於工部局大厦較高處者、仍能攝取若干鏡頭、</p>
<p>點查一過　送上卡車</p>
<p>當上午、工部局大厦中　僅有捕房人員百餘名、此外、卽爲三百十二箱之土地局卷宗、堆置兩旁、至九時十七分、始由工部局公用事業科主任鄧遜氏、開啟聯繫三百十二箱鐵格上之鎖、木箱上之封條與印章、經雙方加以檢騐後、遂自安全室中、絡續搬出、移上預定在外之卡車上、開始其淪落之運命、當起運時、捕房人員俄捕印捕、均環立四圍、從事戒備、</p>
<p>嚴密保護　陸續駛去</p>
<p>至上午十時一刻、木箱全部裝妥、然後由預備隊紅十警備車保護之下、駛離工部局、同時武裝印捕一隊及日憲兵數名、則在卡車上把守、列車沿外灘向北駛去、經外白渡橋至黃浦路口、易以僞「市府警察」、並由日領署當局重再騐看過、然後各卡車續向市中心進行、於是土地局全部卷宗、竟落入僞方之手、</p>
<p>將來糾紛　方興未艾</p>
<p>查此項卷宗、包括本界以外昨午前九時一刻甫過、此項卷宗、卽運出工部局，午後十二時一刻運畢、時工全部土地契據、中外人士產權、均將因工部局此舉、而蒙受鉅大影響、而尤以華人業主爲甚、因華人業主、自此不得不被迫而受僞方左右、據外間謠傳、僞「市府」於此項卷宗到手之後、因多數業主、均擁護重慶中央政府、或將採取報復手段、加以威脅、必要時得將其產業予以「沒收」、唯其中有若干華人業主、聞早經將其產權名義移與外人、惟此種變史、當然尙未在卷宗中註冊、於此可知今後複雜混亂之糾粉、正方興未艾也、</p>
<p>美國領事　並未贊同</p>
<p>兪鴻鈞市長以正式手續寄存工部局之上海土地卷宗、昨已由工部局移交日本駐滬總領三浦矣、查日僞索交此項卷宗、在去年五月間卽已開始、工部局始終認爲此係中國政府託管之物、礙難交付第三者、中外人士頗引爲慰、乃近忽放棄原來立塲、尤予交出並已實行、其經過情形如何、亦一般人所欲知者、據日方大陸新報宣稱、此乃義大利總領事居間斡旋之結果、該報謂「市府」向領事團提出移交土地卷宗之强硬要求後、工部局是董崗本一策則竭力奔走、向各西董遊說、義總領事亦請領事團討論應付交出、其間雖美總領事不願贊同交出之議、但卒因義總領事斡旋於工部局與日方之間、遂採取移交三浦總領事接收之辦法、</p>

<p>貞女姓柳氏，分湖濱之大港人，字嘉音生員朱宗甫，因朱家貧未婚，不幸以疾卒，貞女聞訃，誓歸其家守貞，卽素服號泣而去，鄉里觀者數百人，莫不為之　淚，祇作此詩，以誌紀念！</p>
<p>（一）孟光才德本超倫，願嫁梁鴻豈厭貧；無奈桃夭猶未賦，離鸞一曲淚痕新。（二）報道良人病在閑，焚香先自禱穹蒼；那知氣數終難挽，割股空勞寄藥湯。（三）聞訃怱怱駕棹來，撤環投珥苧裙裁；共姜早矢柏舟志，安用旁人勸百回。（四）未及于歸竟欲歸，從夫豈肯素心違；入門拜見姑嫜後，跪倒靈前涕泗揮。（五）殉夫思捨一身輕，鎮日惟聞哭泣聲；投水投環非一次，連朝絕粒更傷情。（六）夫家本不斷書香，立嗣頻將似續商；伯叔弟兄無幾個，可憐門戶太凄涼。（七）不願依依處母家，貧門甘守玉無瑕；茹茶飲藥心何悔，烈性堅操劇可嘉。（八）白頭尚有老姑存，強作歡顏侍且昏；大節大貞終不泯，尤宜他日荷旌門。</p>

<p>— 莫名</p>
<p>維他命中幾位老大哥：A·B·C……大家都已十分而熟的了，現在這裏要介紹的是他們的一位小弟弟——K。</p>
<p>這位小弟弟雖然還年輕得很，但是「發育」得異乎尋常的迅速。自從一九二五年丹麥的譚姆（Henrik　Dam）博士首先從食物中發現這種能防止動物出血症的質素後，世界科學家羣起而攻，新發現層出不窮，直到去年他的化學構造式和人工合成的方法都相繼硏究成功，今年則連人造品也已在市塲上露面了。前後不過五年，一切問題差不多全吿解決，眞可說是近代科學高速度進展中的代表作品。</p>
<p>維他命K一名一抗出血性維他命」：動物體內缺少了它就要患一種出血症。流血是誰都經騐過的一會事，通常血液會自然地凝固起來把創口封閉，但是當患出血症的時候，血液喪失了原有的凝固能力，結果汨汨地流個不停，造成了嚴重的局勢。原來血液的凝固作用並不是一種簡單的現像，當我們體內發出流血的緊急的警號時，血液內常備的許多「消防隊員」就立刻發動趕往出事地點進行搶救工作。據生理學家吿訴我們，當時在塲參加搶救的人員有：「織維母」，「凝血素」，「凝血素母」，「凝血素核睛」，和「血小板」；它們動作的程序是這樣的：血小板自己破裂，放出大批的凝血素核腈，去跟凝血素母相配合而生成凝血素，凝血素再和纖維母相併合而成纖維蛋白質，這許多織維質能互相連結起來，做成一個嚴密的網，塡滿流血的裂口，於是凝血的大功宣吿完成。至於維他命K在是役中也是一位出力的重要份子，它的任務現在還沒有十分弄淸楚，不過倘若它不在塲，凝血素母就不能產生，搶救工作就無法進行，結果血液就永遠不能凝固。人體的生理作用如此神妙，眞要令人嘆為觀止；我們倘若把人體比做一架精密而複雜的機器，那麼維他命K就是其中一個極小的齒輪，物雖輕微，關係於全部組織却非淺鮮。</p>
<p>含維他命K的食物有紫苴蓿，菠菜，番茄，牛乳等：又因它是一種油溶性的物質，所以各種植物油中也多少含有一點。順便要介紹一下紫首蓿（一名草子，與金花菜同類，但開紫花），這是一種富含各種維他命及其他養料的植物，價廉物美，値得加以提倡，講究食養者幸勿交臂失之。</p>

<p>— 徐翊</p>
<p>日子打着滾，一眨眼，又是炎炎長夏了。</p>
<p>對着喧鬧的馬路，喘不出一口氣，憑着一時的衝動，我也隨着淸間的人們走進了公園。</p>
<p>公園裏，並未隨着春天而衰老的花朶低着頭。蹲在花叢裏的人們，得意地接受着它們的招呼，欣樂地笑了。</p>
<p>於是笑聲佈滿着全園，全園的林葉也低聲地哼起歌調。歌調裏，笑聲中，有着歡樂的人們的寄託，寄託着以人間爲逆旅的人生觀。</p>
<p>突然地，笑聲消失了，消失在花與葉之間，消失在遊子的耳邊——我的心是沉重的。</p>
<p>懷着鄕愁的孩子是悲哀的呢。對着花，花流着鮮紅的血；對着葉，葉幽幽地飲泣；對着人，人的笑聲裏有着一萬個羞慚；對着天空，天空板起了臉，在怒駡着失去了家鄕的孩子的沒有出息。</p>
<p>捫着自己的心窩，我較在鬧市更喘不出氣來了；無力地瞧着四周，四周的人們笑着，笑得多麼起勁呵！</p>
<p>「公園是不配孤寂的年靑人享受的呢，只有原野才是大地的孩子們的啊！公園不過是都市人們的一種妝飾品罷了」</p>
<p>我歎息着，我喘着氣踏出了公園之門。</p>

<h3 id="c102">大時代的生長 <a href="#c102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>— 經緯</p>
<p>我們正面當着偉大的時代，是它給了我們激勵，奮鬥，是埋在堅決的信心裏的新生！然　，這時代有着它的背影，它的成長和經過了不少磨練與驚險的，特別是從紊亂到統一，從離心走到向心，而在這裏，我們更不能忘了靑年的思想變動，是這個偉大的變動促使了大時代的成長。</p>
<p>齊同先生的「新生代」三部曲，就企圖反映出這個連鎖，它不單是部小說，而且也是活的歷史書，雖然我們現在遝祇能看到他的第一部「一二·九」，但這裏已經刻劃了華北靑年思想的路綫，展開了一副英勇的沉毅的畫面！正如作者在小引裏說：「但它的內容却是博大多變，而且淵深。」</p>
<p>在這部「一二·九」裏作者很注重的在寫人，寫年靑人的思想轉變，他們各各有着缺點，也各有着優點，有的前進，有的落伍，有的却竟叛變了，但無論如何，在這些靑年活動着的背後，正顯示着人類應有的進步。這裏有政治腐敗卜的殘酷陰謀，有最大的惡勢力下活動着的爪牙；但從「　二·九」，「一二·一六」，直到寒假下鄕工作，從計劃，示威，被破壞，直到更深入的到民間去；都在在的刻劃了新人物的生長，他們怎樣從書呆子旁觀者漸漸變成革命家，怎樣擺脫了公子哥兒的習性，而達上了堅苦的磨難的鬥爭的道路！</p>
<p>當然，這裏並不全是英雄的畫面，作者用批判的筆去描摹羣衆鬥爭的浮淺，散漫，那是很有力的敎訓；所以有新生，也有犧牲；有堅決，也有動搖；然而「一二·九」正如一顆炸彈，驚醒了全國的靑年，全國的人民。雖然這次鬥爭不足以阻止懦弱的外交的出醜，但是它已激醒了睡獅！這裏的女主人翁魏玲說得好：「但是不要緊，這是種子！不要忘記，還能生出許多新的來，你看，春風已經動了！……」</p>
<p>從這裏，新生代的寫作技巧雖然還有可以改善圓熟的地方，但却是本値得一讀應該一讀的小說，特別是困在孤島感覺到苦悶的靑年們，應該從這裏得到興奮，得到淸醒，（尤其是幾幅挿畫）因為這裏有着你自己的影子，有着整個的新生的影子！（新生代，齊同著，生活書店出版）</p>

<p>第三章　對立的情報</p>
<p>這時候大門外突然起了一陣喧鬧的聲音——汽車聲，人語聲，皮鞋聲，頓時阻斷了金梅的語聲。霍桑和倪金壽也都從皮墊椅上站起來。我覺得這室中的空氣，霎時間也有些緊張起來。</p>
<p>一分鐘後那門外喧擾聲音的來由便被查明，原來警廳裏的載屍車到了。倪金壽袋好了筆冊，搶在霍桑的前面，走出去接洽。不多一回，有一個穿制服的警官，帶了四個穿白衣的抬扛夫，抬着一隻扁狹的舁床，跟倪金壽走進這會客室來。這警官叫做秦默齋，生就一副上得鏡頭的滑稽嘴臉，跟我們早就認識。</p>
<p>他向我們招呼了一下，使微笑着說：「霍先生，已有些綫索了嗎？」</p>
<p>霍桑微微搖一搖頭。「還早。」</p>
<p>「我相信一經你的法眼，什麼秘密，總會給你揭穿。不是我恭維你，那兇手一定跑不了。」秦默齋還向霍桑嘻了一嘻。</p>
<p>霍桑不自在地答道：「秦警長，別說笑話。你吃法律飯，你的眼才是法眼。兇手跑不了跑得了，我可沒有把握。道件事太複雜了。」</p>
<p>「別客氣，你總有辦法。」</p>
<p>「眞的，我的工作必須等你們的工作完畢以後，才能開始。」</p>
<p>「這話什麼意思？」</p>
<p>霍桑不再回答，又從他的衣袋裏摸出他的烟盒來。</p>
<p>倪金壽說道：「秦警長，別發老脾氣罷。你快把屍體抬出去。我們還要問話哩」。他向站在鏡台面前的金梅投射了一眼。</p>
<h3 id="c105">都市 <a href="#c105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>— 雷星</p>
<p>我站立在高樓的窗前俯視這塲都市風光。都市的畫面像一位不够畫手幾筆拙劣的塗抹：那麼雜亂。而我的想像却停駐於古昔。</p>
<p>那時候這地方僅是三五人家的漁村，荒凉伴着寥落；一聲送向遼遠的呼喊，他人也會疑是恐怖的化身。</p>
<p>之後，牠在血淚和屈辱，「文明」的砲火下成長起來。</p>
<p>街面的擾　遮斷了我想像的去路。回歸於現實我要問：都市，今後你往哪兒去？硝烟蔽天，世界鼎沸，你還有幾多好日子呢？這年頭，這日子，誰能一直保持住那份幸運？</p>
<p>如今是淸算的年代。都市，你孕育了多少罪惡？你正在用你的手爲自己挖掘墳墓呢。</p>
<p>而且，砲火是終將回來的。</p>

<p>— 淸暉</p>
<p>最近在「慾　慈航」任主角的愛德華魯濱遜，過去，他的戲永遠限在粗暴的個性中；但是此次確跳出了窠臼，扮起一位仁心仁術，慈悲滿懷的醫師來，依然是步步妥當，處處逼眞。的確，魯濱遜是一個天才的演員。</p>
<p>成功奇蹟　當魯濱遜在學校裏讀書時，每逢有暇，老是提了一隻舊木箱，在街旁人羣中，立起來演講，後來他同別人說，這種演講，對於他以後在銀幕上的演戲，幫助是很大的，因為他時常演講，資格變得老練，於是演戲的時候，也就覺得泰然自如了。</p>
<p>酷愛小孩　魯濱遜的生活感，大都集中於他的家庭，美術品，書籍，好友，以及他的愛子曼米。談話間他時常提起曼米，工作後回家第一件事就是去撫視兒子，有時候背幾段詩歌給他聽。一班朋友，在他家裏，始終是快樂有趣，常會提出一個題目來互相辯論，他也喜歡看戲或是赴音樂會，演講會，並且時常設宴請客。</p>
<p>個性堅強　有一次，他敎訓曼米說：「一個人在社會上，必須尊敬他人，最重要的，應該曉得每個人都有他的尊嚴，如果自己做錯了事。自然咎有應得；倘然不是由於自己的錯誤，而是出於他人的侵擾，那末，為了正義，必須起來奮鬥，以保持自己的尊嚴。」從這段話看來，魯濱遜的個性可想見了，似乎他還想把這堅強的個性傳給他的兒子呢！</p>
<p>烟斗大王　魯濱遜是好萊塢著名的「烟斗大王」，他對於烟斗，有特殊的嗜好，他覺得每一種烟斗，可以代表　種人的性格，譬如：脾氣暴燥的，或深謀遠慮的，看了他的烟斗，就可想像出　二。他曾經搜集了一百零九種烟斗，每種形式不同，不僅雅緻美觀，而且古色古香。在拍戲時，他喜歡用一種巧小的烟斗，因為休息時，可以隨意放在袋子裏。</p>

<p>— 唯我</p>
<p>馬連良輟演之次日，與馬齊名為京朝派三大鬚生之一之譚富英，在更新舞臺登臺，記者準時往觀，記之如後：</p>
<p>「抵院時臺上正演　得意緣」，計艷芬（卽小桂花）年老色衰，扮相殊欠佳妙，演花旦一戲，似已失去品格，但出塲　有人　。</p>
<p>報以彩聲是日艷芬踩蹻，蹻工尚不弱，其他無　可取；姜妙香之慮昆杰，僅演「敎　」一塲，為時不過十數分鐘。繼為楊盛春之「挑滑車」，飾元术者為韓盛信，未見譚世英出塲，楊盛春三年不見，頗多進步，滑車一劇本為盛春之傑作，是夕復係首日打泡，大賣氣力於是此劇乃有如火如荼之妙，與其下靶張連亭對打，更見工夫。惜嗓音依然不振，致大段「石榴花」歌來殊難差強人意，此為美中不足者；盛春設有嗓亮之一日，則不難握當今武生之牛耳也。壓軸為陳麗芳之「女起解」。麗芳為力學硯秋之一人，人皆謂麗芳只能學程之短，未能取程之長，但觀其演起解自有</p>
<p>値得稱贊者。卽唱唸咬字，亦能如硯秋之注重陰陽平也，如流水中「與我三郎把信傳」之「傳」字，如「奴在監中不知春」之「春」字，皆佳；惟硯秋之唱腔，底音頗見工夫，每在底音中討好，麗芳底音不夠，此其短處。</p>
<p>配崇公道之小壽山平穩無疵，可謂難得，大軸為譚富英之全部「空城計」，出塲時之四句引子，末一句頗用力，但仍覺怯塲，似未能盡量發揮；原板中第一句「兩國　鋒龍虎鬥」，意味十足，得一全彩，第四句之「吳要自由」所用之腔，與叔岩所唱者同，此後搖板中「漢諸葛扶幼主」一句，「扶幼主」三字之腔，亦與叔岩所唱者同。綜觀富英此戲，唱腔中學叔岩之處，比比皆是，譚鑫培愚未嘗見，以意度之，富英此戲，必為私淑叔岩無疑。失街亭，看圖一塲，看圖之神情極佳；唸「束手被擒」第二個「束手」翻高，聆之</p>
<p>頗覺痛快接唱搖板「小馬謖失街亭令人可恨」，第三句「老軍們因何故紛紛議論」，「紛紛議論」四字應有佳腔，富英未能使好，末二句「叫老軍掃街道把寬心拿穩」「退司馬保空城端賴此琴」，富英突然冒上，「把寬心拿穩」，使一長腔，且翻高唱，得一全彩，一句「端賴此琴」四字收梢亦頗佳妙。城樓一塲，為全居之命脈，是夕富英僅歌六半調，嗓音未見十分痛快，「我本是」一段慢板，第一句雖得彩，似不如第二句好，下段二六「我正在城樓觀山景」，愚因有事，未及聆異，卽離座他往，致末塲斬謖亦未得觀。至於配角方面，王泉奎之司馬懿尚能稱職，哈寳山之王平極佳，寳山有一下塲身段，妙到秋毫，葉盛茂之馬謖，功候尚淺，不及泉奎周到。但較前次來滬已進步不少，慈瑞泉老當益壯，惟在此劇中飾報子老軍，未能一展所長耳。</p>

<p>Zhengzhou: A unit of the Henan East Chinese Army, on the 29th at midnight, stormed into Shangqiu city, engaging in extremely fierce street fighting with the Japanese. After courageous combat, they annihilated over 600 Japanese soldiers and captured several Japanese officers and other ranks. Shangqiu was thus declared recovered. The remaining Japanese forces retreating outside the city are now being surrounded and fiercely attacked by another Chinese unit. (5th dispatch)</p>
<p>Zhengzhou: The Chinese army advancing northwest toward Daming engaged in fierce fighting with the Japanese at Yangqiao Town on the 27th. By the morning of the 28th, the Japanese forces wavered. They were then heavily reinforced from Qingfeng Yule, launching an active counterattack. They were again dealt a heavy blow by the Chinese army, suffering heavy casualties. (5th dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing: According to Chinese reports, the battle in eastern Henan is still raging fiercely. The Chinese army, having recently recovered Mamuji, is now fiercely attacking Guide. The traffic west of Xuzhou on the Longhai Railway has been cut off. Hao County, on the Henan-Anhui border south of Guide, is also under siege by the Chinese army. The fighting in Kaifeng has shifted to the south of the city. In this attack, the Chinese army stormed into Kaifeng city, capturing countless munitions and destroying thirteen Japanese fortifications and over sixty military trucks. (5th Fast News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>Hong Kong: According to reports from Guilin obtained by the Chinese here, the Chinese army on the Guangxi-Vietnam border is now counterattacking the Longzhou area, making considerable progress. Furthermore, according to information from French residents, traffic between Lang Son, Dong Dang, and Longzhou-Pingxiang has been cut off, which sufficiently confirms the news of this counteroffensive. (5th Fast News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>Zhaoqing: On the 26th of last month, several Japanese aircraft raided the Gaoyao area. One was hit by the Chinese army and crashed into a small island near Sunjian Village in Gaoyao. The entire fuselage was destroyed by fire. (5th dispatch)</p>
<p>Wuming: On the 29th, a unit of the Japanese army advanced toward Funan. They were met with a head-on attack by the Chinese army, resulting in numerous Japanese casualties. The Chinese and Japanese armies are still engaged in fierce fighting east of Funan. (5th dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing: This week, the Japanese have been quite active on the Guangdong-Guangxi border. After being intercepted and ambushed by the Chinese army, they suffered heavy losses and their momentum was completely lost. Regarding the recent fighting in these two areas, a certain military spokesman recently told a Central News Agency reporter the following: On the Guangxi front, the Japanese in Nanning began an offensive west on the 17th of last month, reaching near Suilu on the 21st, and then invading Ningming. After reaching Ningming, they recklessly attacked the vicinity of Longzhou and Zhennanguan. The Chinese army has been consistently employing tactics to lure the Japanese into advantageous terrain for annihilation. It is expected that the Chinese army will have further surprising victories. On the Guangdong front, the Japanese landed at Nantou on the 22nd of last month and advanced toward Shenzhen. After occupying Shenzhen, they advanced to Longgangxu, attempting to invade Huiyang. After several days and nights of bloody fighting, the Chinese army routed the Japanese, who fled back to Nantou. The Chinese army is now advancing fiercely. (4th dispatch)</p>
<p>Inside Kaifeng City: Street Fighting Erupts Again</p>
<p>Zhengzhou: At 2:00 AM on the morning of the 30th, the Chinese army, with swift and violent momentum, stormed into the walls of Kaifeng. The Japanese, caught off guard, collapsed at the sight of the attack. They occupied multiple locations, including the Japanese police station, the Kempeitai, and the special service agency, and continued to surround the remaining Japanese forces. Subsequently, Japanese reinforcements from Xinxiang arrived, but they were ambushed by the Chinese army near Caiyuan Station, causing countless Japanese casualties. Simultaneously, the Chinese army counterattacking toward the South Gate coordinated with the Chinese troops attacking the northern part of the city, engaging the Japanese in fierce fighting. By noon on the 2nd, they stormed into the South Gate and engaged in street fighting. The Japanese launched over ten tanks against the Chinese, who fought valiantly, destroying several Japanese tanks. The Japanese ultimately failed. In this battle, a total of over four thousand seven hundred Japanese were killed, one Japanese armored train and dozens of tanks and vehicles were destroyed, and a large quantity of weapons and ammunition were captured, which are currently being inventoried.

<p>Xingning: The Chaoshan Chinese Army launched a surprise attack on Pushan and Zuolou in Chaozhou Prefecture at 2:00 AM on the 2nd, attacking from multiple directions. After fierce fighting until the 8th, the Japanese were unable to withstand the attack and retreated in defeat. The Chinese army thus recovered Pushan. (4th dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e13">How to Relieve the People's Food Crisis <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>Commodity prices fluctuate wildly, and the lives of Shanghai residents are still in a serious state, without any respite. For example, the Shanghai workers' cost of living index for June continued to rise, reaching a record high of 422.91 percent. The reason for this is the natural result of soaring rice prices. The high rice prices in Shanghai today are not due to an imbalance of supply and demand, but to artificial manipulation. Those who dare to manipulate have their means, their reliance, and their collusion. Not to mention their financial resources, which should not be underestimated, but judging from their reckless and fearless behavior, their audacity is no accident. To discuss supply and demand while ignoring manipulation is pointless. Although there are still no reliable surveys and statistics on rice stocks in Shanghai to cite as evidence, the number of imported foreign rice reported daily in this newspaper is not small. Furthermore, according to inquiries from various sources, if the export of rice from Shanghai were prohibited, it would be sufficient to meet demand before the new grain is harvested, with some left over. There is no shortage of rice on the road, and the number of newly ordered rice is also large. Therefore, there is no fear of insufficient supply for the food needs of the people of Shanghai.</p>
<p>Statistics only show the outline of general life, not the inner suffering. Those who have not personally experienced it cannot easily know the hardships they face. I have often heard workers say that after working all day, they earn a wage of one yuan and forty or fifty cents, and buying two liters of rice costs them more than one yuan. The rice they buy not only has many broken grains, but is also mixed with rice bran without their knowledge. When cooked, it resembles a porridge that is slightly firm, and it is still not enough to feed the family. The children cry from hunger, and the parents' hearts break, yet all their blood and sweat are spent on this. In the past, Shanghai experienced several disturbances due to high grain prices, but recently, although rice prices are unprecedentedly high, there have been few reports of security problems caused by rice prices. This is not evidence that people can afford it, but also because they are mindful of the environment and understand that the situation of the concession authorities is not what it used to be, so they are willing to endure hunger and wait for the authorities to take action. Because of this, the authorities should be particularly aware of the people's suffering and relieve their distress: ensure that rice prices are not controlled and manipulated by unscrupulous merchants and restore them to normal; ensure that there is no parallel market outside the market and no black market outside the parallel market. This depends on effective market management and strict evaluation procedures. Although there is talk of establishing a rice evaluation committee, its effectiveness remains to be seen. If the evaluation committee is properly managed after its establishment, it can eliminate the black market and make market price fluctuations predictable. If it is not done properly, it will still become a refuge for rice merchants, and the situation will be reversed, making it impossible to stabilize rice prices. Therefore, whether the food situation is a blessing or a curse depends on whether the supervision and control are effective and not just empty words. What should be understood now is that price limits and evaluations each have their limits. Price limits are only effective in addressing immediate needs and cannot be sustained. As a result, a black market is bound to emerge, making it impossible to limit prices. The use of evaluation is to restore market prices to the public and eliminate the black market. Once the black market is gone, the market price will be unified. Once it is public, manipulation and price increases will be somewhat restrained, and speculative transactions such as "scalping" and "passing the buck" may be somewhat reduced. Then, rice prices can be expected to rise and fall with supply and demand. However, the benefit to the people's food situation is very limited. Its maximum effect is simply to allow the public to obtain a reasonable amount of rice at a normal price, but it is still far from achieving the goal of lowering rice prices and benefiting the citizens.</p>
<p>The most effective way to help the majority of poor people in an emergency is to carry out large-scale, sustainable grain sales at subsidized prices. In ancient times, subsidized sales involved opening granaries and distributing grain, which could add a large amount of grain to the market, and the subsidized price was not subject to excessive market price constraints, unlike today's subsidized sales, which still require purchasing from the market and reselling to the people. However, it should be noted that subsidized rice sales are exempt from taxes, which is lower than the cost of general rice. If the profit per unit is sought to be non-loss, then the rice will inevitably be subject to wastage, which needs to be compensated by donations from all sectors or public subsidies. Moreover, in carrying out disaster relief sales, convenience should be sought for the majority of buyers, so there should be many locations rather than few, and they should be scattered rather than concentrated. It is pitiful to see poor people stretching their necks and waiting under the scorching sun for this small benefit. Therefore, the unit of measure should be accurate and not eroded, and the quality of the rice should be genuine and not adulterated. All these benefits to the poor depend on the sincerity and strength of those who carry out the work!</p>
<p>If the rice price can return to normal, and subsidized sales can alleviate the suffering of the poor, then it seems that part of the difficulty of the food problem can be solved. But unless there is a gradual improvement plan for the entire food situation, there is no hope for the revival of the people's livelihood. The revival of the people's livelihood cannot be expected of the concession authorities, but punishing rice weevils is within the power and ability of the concession authorities.</p>

<p>New York: According to a United Press report from Washington, U.S. government leaders have remained silent on the statement by a Japanese naval spokesman that the United States must abandon its unreasonable obstruction of Japan's continental policy in the Far East in order to resolve concerns about U.S.-Japan relations. Informed sources interpret the U.S. position differently. The current U.S. government shows no tendency to comply with any conditions demanded by Japan. However, how long this position will be maintained in the new situation depends on various factors, the most important of which is Britain's ability to repel enemy aggression and maintain its own fleet. Britain's seizure of French warships has aroused more than fleeting interest in foreign official circles. As it stands now, Japan, like the United States, is sitting back and watching the progress in Europe, and does not intend to fully implement its new "Asian Monroe Doctrine." (5th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Geneva: According to a London correspondent for the "Geneva Forum," British officials yesterday solemnly denied rumors spread by Japan that the U.S. Navy would soon be integrated into the British Navy for operations. They strongly asserted that the reason for Japan's creation of this rumor was clearly that Britain had strengthened its defenses in Hong Kong and Australia, and the United States had strengthened its defenses in the Philippines, to prevent Japanese Foreign Minister Arita from achieving his dream of dominating the Pacific. At the same time, U.S. Secretary of War Stimson suggested that Britain use U.S. Atlantic ports and the United States use British Pacific ports to mutually exercise police functions, which led to the aforementioned rumors.

<p>Tokyo: The Asahi Shimbun recently published an editorial strongly stating that the current situation in the Pacific is extremely serious. It stated, "The current situation in Hong Kong and the U.S. fleet's return to the Hawaiian Islands are indeed related.

As for Britain, it is also doubtful whether it is deliberately exaggerating the crisis near Hong Kong in order to draw U.S. attention to the Far East. We dare to assert that there is currently no evidence to justify the Hong Kong authorities' declaration of a state of emergency. In short, the Japanese government is determined to pursue its diplomatic policy, and even if it leads to friction with the British and American governments, it will not hesitate to include the South Sea Islands in the 'New Order in East Asia.'"

<p>London: The envoy here has been strenuously trying to persuade the British government to accept its demand to prohibit the transport of war materials from Burma into China. After talks between the Japanese ambassador to London, Mamoru Shigemitsu, and Foreign Secretary Butler, Japanese sources said that Shigemitsu pleaded with the British government to accept Japan's demands, as it was heard that Britain would submit a definite reply. It is claimed that the Japanese ambassador said that Britain's rejection of Japan's demands would hinder the Japanese government's intention to maintain friendly relations with Britain and the United States. The British government seems to be awaiting a response from Australia regarding a draft that Britain is preparing to send to Tokyo next week. It is believed that the British government is also seeking advice from the United States.

(2) Warlords have been stripped of power and all provinces have been united. (3) The western provinces, which have seen no progress for centuries, are now rapidly industrializing, with factories, highways, telephones, telegraphs, ships, post offices, and cities making rapid progress. (4) The Chinese people are optimistic and confident, because no well-equipped Chinese army has been captured or annihilated by the Japanese army. (5th United Press dispatch)</p>

<p>Washington: US naval circles announced today that the US Navy Department is currently planning to build eighty-seven new warships in the coming months. Sixty-eight of these eighty-seven new ships are specified in President Roosevelt's $1,277,741,000 national defense supplementary program. The other nineteen are listed in the 1941 naval budget. According to officials, these two shipbuilding programs will be rapidly contracted to existing private shipyards and naval shipyards. Naval shipyards have recently been ordered to implement accelerated work programs, increasing the regulated forty-hour work week to forty-eight hours, with increased wages corresponding to the increased work hours. The Navy Department now requires $144,400,000 to build 367,000 tons of warships, including three new aircraft carriers, thirteen cruisers, thirty destroyers, and twenty-two submarines. In addition, $78,400,000 is earmarked for the construction of cannons and other equipment. Of these 367,000 tons of new ships, Congress has approved but not yet allocated construction funds for 20,000 tons, with supplementary ships accounting for 167,000 tons. These 167,000 tons of supplementary warships, enough to increase the strength of the US fleet by eleven percent, are included in the Vinson Naval Act. This move by the Navy Department will enable the construction of 143 warships in the short term, with fifty-six already under construction. These fifty-six ships under construction include eight battleships, totaling 45,000 tons, six light cruisers, twenty-seven destroyers, fourteen submarines, and one aircraft carrier.

<p>Tokyo: The position of the Yonai Cabinet has been unstable for some time. According to well-informed sources, the cabinet's demise may be a matter of days. In view of Germany's military victories, the Yonai Cabinet's policies over the past six months, in the eyes of Japanese political commentators, have only proven that the cabinet has completely failed to foresee the world situation and the creation of a "new order" in Europe. Its lifeless negotiations with the Wang Jingwei government in Nanjing have also been widely criticized. In addition, the recent surge in prices, shortages of goods, and increasing internal unrest have allowed the Konoe-led faction to seize the opportunity to revive with great momentum. The faction will represent the broad national interests, not just the warmongering political parties. Its goal is to overthrow the Yonai Cabinet. After Foreign Minister Arita delivered a broadcast speech on June 27, outlining the international situation and the position of the Japanese Empire, the situation became even more urgent. The speech was the result of pressure from the military, and abandoned the government's declaration regarding Japan's future foreign policy. Rumors suggest that both the army and navy now oppose the issuance of formal communiqués that would bind the government's hands at a time when the world situation is undergoing unexpected developments. After consulting with Army Minister Hata Shunroku, senior officials of the Ministry of the Army, and twenty-five army generals, Prime Minister Yonai met with them on July 1 to present the military's views and advocate for the implementation of a stronger policy, as outlined in Arita's broadcast, arguing that Japan should seize the current golden opportunity to lay a solid foundation for "East Asian autonomy." With Puyi's recent visit to Japan and the government busy with hospitality, immediate action was suspended. The new cabinet will likely be led by Konoe or organized by someone else, which has not yet been decided. However, judging from the atmosphere prevailing throughout Japan, it seems certain that a strong nationalistic policy will be implemented. According to the Asahi Shimbun, the Japanese government has fully decided to implement a foreign policy that includes the South Seas in the proposed new order of the Far East, regardless of the risk of friction with the British and American governments. Judging from the situation, Japan will first focus on French Indochina, where there is the possibility of an "automatic" independence movement. Dealing with Hong Kong is a second step. Although Britain's refusal to accept Japan's proposals to cease allowing goods destined for Chongqing to transit through Hong Kong and Burma, and to withdraw British troops stationed in Shanghai, is enough to create a critical situation in South China and Shanghai, Japan is unlikely to take any immediate military action. If there are any signs of German success in attacking Britain, then firmly consolidating the "Axis" is almost certain to be intended. (5th, Reuters dispatch)</p>

The British fleet commander presented an ultimatum to Vice Admiral Gensoul, stating that if the French fleet refused to join the British fleet, the British ships would destroy the French ships to prevent them from falling into the hands of Germany and Italy. Vice Admiral Gensoul replied that he would resist force with force, and that the entire French navy would fight against Britain after the British ships fired the first shot. After receiving the report, the French Navy Department also ordered resistance with force, and the French government approved the Navy Department's decision and notified the Armistice Commission of this fact. Germany and Italy did not demand the surrender of the French navy, but only demobilization, keeping the French ships in French ports, under the control of the Armistice Commission. British government leaders attempted to control the French fleet, and the only countermeasure for the French fleet was to scuttle them. The British fleet did not wait for the French fleet to respond within the prescribed time, but immediately laid magnetic mines in Mers-el-Kébir by aircraft, and opened fire on the French ships after the expiration of the ultimatum. According to reports received by the French Navy Department, the cruiser "Bretagne" has sunk, and the "Dunkerque," "Provence," and "Mogador" have also caught fire. (5th, Haitong dispatch)</p>
<p>British Naval Secretary Reports on Battle Situation: Battle of Mers-el-Kébir in Progress</p>
<p>London: Naval Secretary Alexander broadcast last night, speaking about the British handling of the French fleet, praising Admiral Somerville and his men, saying that the British fleet suffered only minor losses, with one officer and one soldier wounded, and one aircraft missing. From the glorious cooperation between the two navies at Dunkirk to the tragic action at Mers-el-Kébir, the path taken was a painful one. If one could continue to fight the common enemy to the final victory, nothing would bring greater joy. However, we have repeatedly advised and pleaded, and tried various solutions to avoid dangers that would hinder our principles, but to no avail. Now, hundreds of French officers and soldiers have voluntarily joined us, willing to continue fighting for the common cause. We welcome them and wish them success in their great work. (5th, Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>London: According to Madrid Radio, the battle between the British and French fleets at Mers-el-Kébir is still in progress this morning. (5th, United Press dispatch)</p>
<p>Alexandria: No news has been released regarding the future of the French fleet in Alexandria. Today, the joint British and French fleet remains docked in this port, appearing as peaceful as usual. (5th, Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>London: According to information currently being revealed, on June 19 (two days after the French surrender), several French naval vessels sailed into Plymouth, where they were warmly welcomed by thousands of people on the shore. Three tugboats were responsible for attending to the first French ship to arrive. After the ship reached the shore, it was discovered to be filled with departing sailors, far more than needed to operate the ship. It was then learned that these sailors were all from shore-based units located at the ship's base. Several French speedboats entered the harbor that evening, followed the next morning by submarines, destroyers, and smaller ships. Day after day, large numbers of French small ships continued to arrive, including armed fishing vessels, tugboats, and merchant ships. On July 3, two more destroyers arrived. It is now heard that there are still French ships hiding in Scottish territorial waters. (5th, Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Italian Navy Assists France in Combat, Willing but Unable</p>
<p>London: Rome Radio broadcast in response to British Prime Minister Churchill's statement that "the Italian Navy carefully avoids Mers-el-Kébir," saying that the Italian Navy observed the battle from afar because it could not reach the area in time. The radio station threatened naval retaliation and asked the British fleet to repeat its actions against the Italian naval base. (5th, Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Rome: The Italian government last night refused to confirm or deny reports that the Italian fleet was sailing at top speed towards Mers-el-Kébir to assist the French navy in fighting the British fleet. A government spokesman stated that any such information would be considered a "military secret." (5th, Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Rome: German newspapers have denounced Churchill as a villain, saying that Britain should be hanged opposite the Nelson statue in Trafalgar Square. Today, Italian newspapers have followed suit, expressing unrestrained anger at Britain's naval action at Mers-el-Kébir. All newspapers denounce this act as the greatest crime in history, and many call Churchill a "thug." (5th, Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>British Actions Against French Fleet Affect US Naval Policy</p>
<p>Washington: Unofficial sources believe that Britain's takeover or sinking of the French fleet is an important factor in the United States' decision on whether to keep its fleet in the Pacific. If Britain's achievements are as reported by the British, then the US fleet will remain in Hawaii, or at least in the East for the time being, to observe whether Britain's naval power can withstand attacks by the German air force. There is no need for the US fleet to move to the Atlantic until the British fleet has completely failed and the British government is in real danger. (5th, United Press dispatch)</p>
<p>Britain Takes Decisive Measures, US and Turkey Express Sympathy</p>
<p>New York: Today's newspapers all prominently feature the British action against the French fleet. British Prime Minister Churchill's speech was met with sympathy. Americans especially admired Churchill's submission of this action to the United States for judgment. The United States was previously too busy dealing with its surroundings to care about other matters. Now that Britain has occupied the French fleet, the United States can reduce its worries. (5th, Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Washington: Members of Congress here yesterday unanimously approved of Britain's actions against the French fleet. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Pittman believed that Britain's actions restored people's faith in Britain's war efforts. Senator William King told the press that he believed Britain's actions were very proper. "Anything that strengthens Britain's power also strengthens our power. I hope that France will hand over its fleet to Britain. Britain's taking this extraordinary action is entirely justified. Anyone who fights for democracy must welcome Britain's actions. It must be known that gaining political and economic control of Latin America and the United States is also one of the goals of the totalitarian nations. If Britain can continue to resist and the British navy remains intact, then the totalitarian nations' goals will be difficult to achieve." Other members of Congress also unanimously approved of Britain's actions. (5th, United Press dispatch)</p>
<p>Ankara: After the news of the fate of the French fleet was released today, people here felt a mixture of comfort and satisfaction. In the past, people were deeply concerned about the lack of news about the whereabouts of the French fleet. Turkey approves of the measures taken by the British, as its historical motto is "action."

<p>Suez Canal Issue: Rumors of Secret Agreement Between Germany, Italy, and France</p>
<p>Cairo: Reports state that France, Germany, and Italy concluded a secret agreement regarding the Suez Canal during the armistice negotiations. (5th, Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Rome: The naval battle between the British and French fleets near Mers-el-Kébir is a turning point in the international situation. Italian figures believe that the British government has openly regarded France as an enemy country. Political figures here point out that after the British navy attacked the French fleet, the US theory of a joint struggle by Western democracies against dictatorships to "safeguard freedom of rights" has gone bankrupt, and the US intervention policy has lost its meaning and basis.

<h3 id="e31">The British Government's Determination to Fight: Peace Rumors Collapse of their own Accord. Reluctant but Stern Measures Against the French Fleet: Churchill's Tearful Speech in the House of Commons <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>London - Prime Minister Churchill stated in the House of Commons yesterday afternoon that the rumors and slanders that Britain intends to negotiate peace with the German and Italian governments should be dispelled by our necessary adoption of painful and severe actions. There will be no negotiation and no peace talks. We will do our best to wage war with all means at our disposal until the just peace we seek is achieved. (Cheers from the audience). The "painful and severe actions" referred to by the Prime Minister pertain to the Anglo-French naval battle at Mers-el-Kébir in Algeria on Wednesday, and the British taking control of French warships docked in British ports Portsmouth and Plymouth to prevent them from falling into German hands. After the commander of the French fleet at Mers-el-Kébir refused the British request to transfer the fleet to British control, the British fleet attacked the French fleet, sinking or destroying several of its ships. According to the Prime Minister's announcement, two French battleships, two cruisers, eight destroyers, several submarines, and two hundred small vessels, including minesweepers and anti-submarine vessels, docked in Portsmouth and Plymouth were taken over by British soldiers on Wednesday after the British issued a brief notice to the captains of each vessel. There was no resistance or bloodshed, except for one British officer and one French officer killed and several people injured on the giant submarine "Surcouf." Most of the French crew members gladly accepted this and hundreds expressed a strong desire to continue fighting against Germany. Several French submarines in the Mediterranean have automatically joined the British fleet, and French ships docked in the port of Alexandria have also received notification not to leave the port. A large part of the French fleet has been placed under British control, or sunk, or rendered inaccessible to Germany. Britain will also find ways to prevent other French warships from falling into German hands. The full text of Churchill's speech is as follows:</p>
<p>France Breaks a Solemn Promise</p>
<p>I have to announce to the House with heartfelt sorrow that we must take measures to prevent the French fleet from falling into enemy hands. When two countries are fighting side-by-side against a common enemy under a solemn alliance, one country may, due to exhaustion and coercion, have to ask its ally to waive its obligations. The least we can expect from the French government is that when it abandons the war and places its full weight on Britain, it should be careful not to inflict unnecessary harm on its loyal ally, which hinders the ultimate victory of Britain upon which French freedom depends. The House will recall that we offered to release the French from their treaty obligations, attaching one condition: that the French fleet should sail into British harbors before separate armistice negotiations were completed. France did not do this. Although French Fleet Commander Darlan made various personal promises and guarantees to the British, the armistice agreement was ultimately signed, placing the French fleet under German and Italian power, just as effectively as the other French ships that did not head to African ports ten days ago but sailed into Portsmouth and Plymouth and fell under British power. The Bordeaux government, knowing the consequences of this matter and its danger to us, refused Britain's appeal when abandoning the alliance and canceling the agreement. I must record how significant the harm they inflicted on Britain was. There is also something that can be described as heartless or malicious treatment, which did not come from the French people who had never heard of this matter, but from the Bordeaux government. What is this matter? More than four hundred captured German pilots imprisoned in France, mostly shot down by the British Air Force, were to be handed over to Britain by former French Prime Minister Reynaud for custody. But after Reynaud fell, they were returned to Germany. There is no doubt that the Bordeaux government did this to win Germany's favor (and disregarded the harm inflicted on us. When the German Air Force was in dire need of senior pilots, the Bordeaux government returned four hundred elite pilots, knowing that they would wreak havoc on Britain and require the British Air Force to shoot them down again. Isn't this even more hateful? I know that history will never forgive this absurd act. I believe that the French will eventually rise up to sweep away this stain and restore their national honor.</p>
<p>Resolute Action to Save Ourselves and Others</p>
<p>Last week, I said that we must now give special attention to our self-defense. In all my experience, I have never seen such a painful and sad issue discussed in the Cabinet as the one concerning the disposal of the French fleet. The reasons for the method we are duty-bound to carry out are so strong that all the members have the same confidence in what should be done, without hesitation or disagreement. The twelve members of the military cabinet, as well as the Minister of Information and the Minister of Colonial Affairs, who is most famous for his friendship with France, all felt that there was no other option but this. We unanimously made this decision with sadness and clear observation. Therefore, after various preparations were completed yesterday morning, a large part of the French fleet was placed under our control, or made to comply with our needs. Two French battleships and two light cruisers, several submarines, including the giant submarine "Surcouf," and about two hundred small but extremely useful minesweepers, mostly docked in Portsmouth, were taken over by British soldiers after the British sent a brief notice to the captains of each vessel. Except for a conflict on the large submarine "Surcouf" due to a misunderstanding, which resulted in the death of one British officer and two sailors, and one French officer, and one injury on each side, everything else proceeded smoothly without resistance or bloodshed. Most of the French sailors gladly accepted the end of this uncertain period, and 800 to 900 people expressed their strong desire to continue fighting against Germany and requested to become British citizens. We are prepared to especially please them, and we will not discriminate against other thousands of Frenchmen who wish to fight as Frenchmen. The rest will be sent back to France when the French government is able to welcome them back with the consent of the German rulers. The French soldiers in Britain will also be sent back, except for those who voluntarily serve under General de Gaulle to engage in national salvation work. Several French submarines have automatically joined the British fleet, and we have accepted their services. The port of Alexandria in the Mediterranean is home to a strong British fleet, and four French battleships and one cruiser, three new warships equipped with eight-inch guns, and several smaller ships are also docked nearby. They have now received notice not to leave the port without authorization, so as not to fall into the power of France's conquerors. Negotiations and discussions are of course underway, and there is no need to tell the House the details. Methods have been taken to ensure that the French fleet either sinks into the sea or complies with our wishes. This morning, when Italian aircraft attacked Alexandria, some French warships also opened fire on the common enemy. From this alone, we can imagine the pain that the British and French naval personnel felt in spirit regarding the disposal of the French fleet. We will provide convenience and supplies to the French soldiers in Alexandria who wish to continue fighting until the end of the war. We are also willing to send the rest back to France, and we will do our best to take care of them to ensure their safety when they leave Alexandria.</p>
<p>The most serious part of this matter still exists. The French Navy's best warships, the "Dunkerque" and "Strasbourg," are new battlecruisers superior to the German "Scharnhorst" and "Gneisenau." Now, along with two battleships, several light cruisers, and destroyers and submarines, they are docked in Mers-el-Kébir on the coast of Morocco in North Africa. Yesterday morning, the British selected Colonel Holland, the former naval attaché stationed in Paris, to go by destroyer to see the commander of the French fleet, but he was refused. Holland left a document.</p>
<p>Presenting an Ultimatum, Ultimately Rejected</p>
<p>I may as well read the contents of this document to the House. Its three paragraphs concern the armistice issue. The document then states, "We, your former comrades, cannot allow the warships under your command to fall into German and Italian power. We are determined to fight to the end. If we win, as we expect, we will not forget that France was originally our ally, and our interests are also France's interests, because our common enemy is Germany. We solemnly declare that if we win, we will restore France's greatness and territory. For this reason, we must prevent the best warships of the French Navy from being used by this common enemy to control us. In this environment, the British government instructs me to request that the French fleet stationed in Mers-el-Kébir take one of the following actions: (A) sail out with us to continue fighting against Germany and Italy to seek victory; (B) sail to a British port under our supervision, leaving only a few crew members, and the remaining crew members can be sent back to France as soon as possible. If either of the above two options is adopted, Britain is willing to return this warship to France at the end of the war. If it is damaged, Britain is willing to fully compensate; (C) if you believe that French warships should not attack Germany and Italy unless Germany and Italy violate the armistice agreement, then French warships can sail to French ports in the West Indies, such as Martinique, with only a few crew members, where French warships can be disarmed to our satisfaction, or entrusted to the United States for safekeeping, pending the outcome of the war, and the crew members can be sent back. If you refuse the above method, I have to ask you with deep regret to scuttle each ship within six hours, otherwise, I am instructed by the British government to use the force we deem necessary to prevent the French ships from falling into enemy hands." (Great cheers from the audience).</p>
<p>We had hoped that one of the methods we proposed could be accepted by the French side, and that there would be no need to use the terrible force of the British warship fleet. But it was not so, and the British fleet appeared before Mers-el-Kébir two hours after Colonel Holland's departure. The commander of this fleet was Vice Admiral Somerville, who had recently carried over 100,000 Frenchmen during the Dunkirk evacuation and had a distinguished record. In addition to battleships, he also had cruisers and destroyers at his command. After a day of deliberation, we still hoped before noon that our conditions could be accepted without bloodshed. However, the French commander undoubtedly obeyed the orders of the Wiesbaden Germans and refused to comply, saying that he was willing to fight. Therefore, the British government instructed Vice Admiral Somerville to complete his mission before nightfall. At 3:58 p.m., the British fleet opened fire and bombarded the powerful French fleet, which was also protected by shore batteries. At 6:00 p.m., the British commander reported that he was engaged in combat. The British aircraft carrier "Ark Royal" also provided fierce assistance. At 7:20 p.m., the British commander reported again, saying that "one Strasbourg-class battlecruiser was injured and ran aground, and two 'Bretagne'-class battleships were one sunk and one injured, and two French destroyers and one aircraft carrier were sunk or destroyed. While this tragic battle was in progress, another battlecruiser, the 'Strasbourg' or 'Dunkerque,' tried to leave the port in order to sail to Toulon or a port in North Africa, and placed itself under German control in accordance with the Bordeaux government's armistice conditions. However, the crew members may not have known it. The British fleet's aircraft attacked it, and the ship was hit by at least one torpedo. However, the ship may have contacted several French ships that sailed out of Algiers at night, and was able to reach Toulon, which we could not pursue. The 'Dunkerque' has been injured and will not be able to fight for several months.</p>
<p>Mocking the Italian Navy Standing idly by</p>
<p>Although the French warships fought for an unnatural reason, they showed the courage characteristic of the French Navy during the war, which is needless for me to say. The French commander and his subordinates felt that they had to comply with the orders issued by their government under German direction. We must give them all kinds of forgiveness. I am afraid that the loss of life among the French people and in the harbor will be quite large, because we were forced to use very violent force, and I heard several major explosions. In this battle, the British ships were not affected by the opponent's fierce artillery fire in terms of firepower or action. I have not yet received reports of British casualties, but the fleet commanded by Vice Admiral Somerville is intact in all military aspects and ready to fight again (cheers from the audience). The Italian Navy, which we are also prepared to deal with, whose number of ships is certainly greater than the British ships fighting at Mers-el-Kébir, carefully avoided it (great laughter). However, in the battle we are about to wage to consolidate its control of the Mediterranean, the Italian Navy will eventually be damaged. To this day, a large part of the French fleet has been transferred into our hands, or is unable to participate in the war, or has escaped German power. As for the French ships that are still free at sea, we are determined to do our best to prevent them from falling into German hands. Let the Congress judge the merits and demerits of our actions this time, let the people judge, let the United States judge, let the world judge, and let history judge (great cheers from the audience).</p>
<p>Fully Prepared to Cope with the Offensive</p>
<p>At this point, I would like to talk about the near future. We certainly expect the enemy to attack, and we are now doing our best to make various preparations. Whether the enemy attacks Britain or Ireland, we will be able to defeat them. All the people of Ireland, regardless of their faith or party affiliation, should know that Ireland is in imminent danger. We know this very well, so we are engaged in arrangements from morning to night. However, there is no benefit in publicly discussing this matter. Even in secret meetings, the government must make some reservations. I ask the British people and those who sympathize with us on both sides of the Atlantic to give us their greatest assistance. We are now facing a time of great danger and glorious hope with its autonomous regions. All the virtues of our nation will be tested. This is not a time for doubt or weakness, but a very important time for us to answer the call. I would now like to read to the House a document that I have sent to those who hold important positions under the Crown. I would be happy to send this document to all the members for their adoption, but not because they need this advice. The document says, "Before the enemy's invasion, the Prime Minister would like to encourage those in responsible positions in the government to be vigilant and self-respecting. Any precautions must be taken. Since time and method are both available, there is no reason to say that the enemy can land in Britain from the air or the sea in greater numbers than our current army can annihilate or capture. The Air Force is extremely well-organized and powerful, unprecedented. The German Navy has never been so weak as it is today, and the British Home Army has never been so strong as it is today. I expect all senior officials to set an example of stability and determination, and to stop or condemn the opinions of those around them or subordinates who express indigestion. If any official is seen to be deliberately using forces that disturb people's hearts or weaken people's spirits, or making such statements, they should be reported immediately or dismissed. Only in this way will we not be ashamed of the soldiers who fearlessly defend the enemy on land, sea, and air.</p>
<p>Seeking Victory, Never Making Peace</p>
<p>In short, I feel that we should get the trust of the House (cheers from the audience). The members should believe that no matter how difficult our duties are, we will never be negligent. The actions we have already taken are enough to forever dispel the slanders and rumors spread by German propagandists in the United States and elsewhere, and created by the Fifth Column in Britain. They said that we have chapters for peace with the enemy. All of this should be completely dispelled by the painful and severe actions we were forced to take. In this country, which has long been known for its love of peace, there is no thought of making peace. Not only that, but we also want to wage war with the greatest courage and all means until the just goals we are fighting for have been achieved (Reuters, 5th).</p>

<p>London - Britain launched a large-scale air raid on Europe yesterday to break Hitler's plan to invade the three islands. British planes successfully bombed German transport ships in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, and German transport planes staying in Belgium. According to officials, other British planes flew to Germany and bombed at least twelve German cities. German military supply depots in Belgium were also hit and destroyed. The German transport ship sunk in Rotterdam is widely believed to have been used to transport troops to London (International News Agency, 5th).</p>
<p>London - The Air Ministry announced that the British Air Force flew day and night to Europe for larger-scale bombings. On Wednesday, British bombers attacked enemy oil plants, transportation lines, and storage depots, as well as ships near Rotterdam and Schoorl, and aircraft yards and troop transport planes in Eben-Emael in Belgium. The explosions caused fires and damage. High-explosive bombs in the hangar at the Eben-Emael airfield immediately caught fire. Enemy aircraft in The Hague airfield were also hit. All British planes returned safely. The weather was unfavorable for flying at night, but British planes still flew to the Aachen airfield in Germany, the Twente airfield in the Netherlands, and the Mauville airfield in France for large-scale attacks. One British plane was missing. A German military headquarters communiqué stated that 75 British planes were destroyed between June 23 and July 4. In fact, during this period, British planes only lost 30 planes. The enemy admitted to losing only 12 planes, but in reality, the British Air Force destroyed 40 enemy planes (Reuters, 5th).</p>
<p>London - The Admiralty, Air Ministry, and Internal Security Department issued a communiqué yesterday stating that enemy aircraft flew close to a certain port on the coast of the Strait today. A naval auxiliary ship in Portland Harbor was hit and caught fire. A small tugboat and a barge each sank. The houses were slightly damaged. Several civilians were killed or injured. Another batch of enemy aircraft invaded southwestern England and dropped bombs, but did not hit military targets. No deaths or injuries were reported. Anti-aircraft guns fired in several places, and fighter planes also took off for combat. According to the news received so far, a British fighter plane patrol shot down an enemy bomber. It has now been confirmed that seven enemy planes were shot down during the enemy attack on Britain on Wednesday. A German plane was shot down by anti-aircraft fire in southwestern England yesterday. Three crew members died. The other two parachuted down and were reportedly arrested. British planes engaged enemy fighter planes off the south coast of England last night. One enemy plane was shot down at sea. Another enemy plane was severely damaged. Enemy planes tried to attack the southeastern coast of England last night. British planes intercepted them and aerial battles occurred. The German planes were driven out to sea and did not drop bombs (Reuters, 5th).</p>

<p>Bucharest - Romania formed a new government yesterday afternoon. Its line-up is as follows: Prime Minister Gigurtu (newly appointed), Associate Prime Minister General Mihail (newly appointed), Foreign Minister Manolescu (newly appointed), Minister of Labor Gigescu (newly appointed), Minister of Transportation Macovei (incumbent), Minister of Economy Leon (newly appointed), Minister of the Interior Popescu (newly appointed), Minister of the Army Niculescu (newly appointed), Minister of the Navy and Air Force Admiral Petrescu (newly appointed), Minister of National Groups Roşu (newly appointed), Minister of Culture Şeima (newly appointed), Minister of Health Professor Comou (newly appointed), Minister of Propaganda Professor Cleiniceanu (newly appointed), Minister of Education Caracosti (newly appointed), Minister of Justice Gruia (newly appointed) (Haitong News Agency, 5th).</p>
<p>Bucharest - The Romanian government led by Gigurtu will adopt a decisive pro-German policy. Its most prominent symbol is the appointment of German Senator Roşu as Minister of National Groups. At the same time, Foreign Minister Manolescu, Minister of Education Caracosti, and Minister of Health Cleiniceanu have extremely close scientific ties with Germany. The anti-Jewish colors of the new Romanian cabinet are unusually strong, and it can be directly called a pro-German and anti-Jewish cabinet (Haitong News Agency, 5th).</p>
<p>Bucharest - New Prime Minister Gigurtu declared today that faithfully participating in the German-Italian axis system is the cornerstone of Romania's new foreign policy. The Romanian government understands the national sentiment and believes that this foreign policy is not only in line with international relations, but also in harmony with political concepts. The Romanian government is determined to maintain close relations with its neighboring countries, because the maintenance of peace in Southeast Europe is an indispensable factor in creating a good political order. The various regional alliances concluded by Romania are steps to implement this policy. In terms of domestic affairs, the Romanian government is determined to maintain security and order, and those who spread rumors must be stopped. Romania's military strength must be enhanced, and various economic problems will be solved through cooperation. The refugee problems in Bessarabia and Bukovina will also be resolved quickly (Haitong News Agency, 5th).</p>

<p>Moscow. Following the publication of the German Fifth and Sixth White Papers, Izvestia commented, "The instigators of the war have clearly failed militarily, and one of the results is the leakage of the most secret documents, which fully demonstrate the authors' predatory policies. Today, we are publishing relevant documents from the German Fifth and Sixth White Papers. These documents reveal the Anglo-French plans to attack the Soviet Union and the scandalous participation of several neighboring countries (Turkey and Iran) in these plans. These documents further prove that the Soviet Union should strengthen its northern and southern defenses and be vigilant along the borders with Finland, the Baltic States, Romania, and Turkey. Britain and France continue to spread rumors that the steps taken by the Soviet Union in Finland and the Baltic States are a threat to Germany. The purpose of spreading these rumors is twofold: first, to undermine German-Soviet relations, but German-Soviet relations have already been determined by the existing agreements between the two countries, and conspirators will have no way to undermine them. Second, the authors of these documents intend to use these rumors as a smokescreen for their anti-Soviet conspiracy. The defensive measures taken by the Soviet Union have timely thwarted the anti-Soviet plans of British and French imperialism. This point has been fully proven by the Sixth White Paper. At the Sixth Session of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, Molotov said, 'Since the Soviet Union is unwilling to be used by Britain and France to fight Germany, it must be prepared to deal with their extreme hostility towards the Soviet Union.' Today, the documents we are publishing prove the depth of British and French hostility towards us, as evidenced by the poisonous nature of their anti-Soviet plans. They are doing everything they can to prepare to attack our country in the north, south, and southeast, while at the same time using various provocative acts to force the Soviet Union to abandon its neutral position. In short, this plan has exhausted all possibilities of ingenuity and ruthlessness. Everyone knows that General Gamelin has ingloriously ended his life's work. He had a plan to assist the Finnish Defense Forces in attacking the Soviet Union and boasted of the 'spiritual' benefits of this assistance. The authors of these documents attempted to drag other countries into the war for their own benefit. The organizers of the war first used Finland as a test case. Gamelin planned to directly intervene in the Finnish war, with British and French troops landing in Petsamo and seizing Swedish and Norwegian seaports. But whether the benefits gained were as accurate as Gamelin predicted can be judged from Gamelin's fate. Gamelin's judgment was not too bad in terms of commercial bookkeeping, but it was indeed wrong militarily. The ruling class in London was extremely disappointed after the defeat of the Finnish Defense Forces and the signing of a peace treaty between the Soviet Union and Finland. In view of the above facts, this disappointment is not without reason. After the failure of the northern advance, the anti-Soviet organizers shifted their activities southward. They planned to attack our Caucasus. General Weygand planned to bomb Soviet oil wells. Regarding this matter, the French ambassador to Turkey, Massigli, reported the possible consequences to his superiors. This bombing would be a cruel massacre and destruction, but at the very least, it would force the Soviet Union to join the war. As for the plan to bomb Baku and Batumi, it is particularly noteworthy. According to the French ambassador to Turkey, he had discussed this matter in detail with the Turkish Foreign Minister, Saracoğlu. At that time, the Foreign Minister expressed his determination to do his best to help implement this plan. In addition, Iran's role in the Turkish plan was also clarified during the friendly discussions mentioned above. However, since Turkey and Iran have signed non-aggression treaties with the Soviet Union, how could they participate in such a conspiracy? Although Turkey and Iran are willing to be driven by imperialism, this kind of foreign policy decision is to be expected. They must first exchange documents on 'maintaining peace,' and then sign so-called 'guarantees,' but the result will inevitably be that the initiators bear the brunt. The materials in the Fifth White Paper fully prove this point. These materials show the methods used by Britain and France to force the Netherlands and Belgium to fight for them, and at the same time confirm that the firm stance of the leaders of Belgium and the Netherlands has made it impossible for Britain and France to use the two countries as military bases for attacking Germany. The documents published today have fully demonstrated the names of all countries preparing to attack the Soviet Union. The great Soviet Union does not fear the conspirators of imperialism. It will continue to take various steps to ensure the safety of the Soviet people and their happy lives. In this regard, the new documents have not and cannot change everything at the same time. The value of these documents lies in their accurate depiction of the division of labor in the imperialist camp, so that we can make a deduction." (TASS, 5th)</p>

<p>Berlin. The sixth document in the Sixth Volume of the German White Paper is a secret report from the French Ambassador to Turkey, Massigli, sent back to the French Foreign Ministry by special messenger. Massigli discussed the possibility of Anglo-French air strikes on the Baku oil region of Soviet Russia, advocating that Britain and France should bypass Turkey and Iran and carry out bombing raids on the Baku oil region, and advocating that the Turkish government should not be notified in advance to avoid unnecessary unpleasantness. In the future, either wait until the facts are accomplished, or wait until the opportunity is in progress, and then notify the Turkish authorities. If an apology is made to Turkey, it is indicated that the plane will pass through Turkish territory. If the Soviet Union protests to Turkey, Turkey can indicate that it has never heard of it in advance. If the situation is too serious, Turkey can declare to the parliament that the blame lies with Soviet Russia, because Soviet Russia caused the trouble. Massigli's secret report also revealed that Britain and France hoped that Turkey would immediately join the war, but Turkey was quite reluctant for various reasons. In the report, Massigli also discussed the issue of control of the Black Sea, believing that the ships of the five countries of Soviet Romania, Germany, could be controlled, advocating that the detained ships should be taken to ports for confiscation of ships and cargo. Finally, Massigli believed that bombing the Baku oil region would not cause any major consequences, but would instead provide Turkey with more convenience for the Allied countries, and at the same time, control of the Black Sea would be easier to implement. (Haitong Telegraph, 4th)</p>
<p>Berlin. The German Foreign Ministry continued to publish the sequel to the Sixth White Paper last night, that is, Section 7 of the document archives copied by the French General Staff was a letter from French Prime Minister Daladier to Gamelin on January 19, 1940, asking him to draft a plan to destroy the Soviet Russian oil fields. The original letter is as follows: Regarding the plan to destroy the Soviet Russian oil fields, the Army Commander-in-Chief Gamelin and the Navy Commander-in-Chief Darlan are responsible for drafting it. The main points are as follows: (1) Cut off the oil transported to Germany via the Black Sea; (2) Directly intervene in the Caucasus; (3) Do not directly conflict with Soviet Russia, but take steps to support the independence of the Caucasian Muslims (Haitong Telegraph, 4th)</p>
<p>Berlin. Section 8 of the German White Paper is the understanding between the British and French Air Forces regarding the bombing of oil fields. The original text is as follows: "April 5 (Confidential Regarding the bombing of the Caucasian oil fields, the British and French Air Forces have reached an understanding. The British and French bombing targets are limited to the oil fields and seaports of Baku, destroying 20% to 30% of them within six days. The air force sent will include six French aircraft and three British aircraft, a total of 90 to 100 aircraft, with each flight plan dropping 70 tons of bombs. (Haitong Telegraph, 4th)</p>
<p>Berlin. The German Foreign Ministry yesterday continued to publish the documents copied from the French General Staff, the 17th of which was a telegram from General Weygand to General Li Long, the military attaché of the French Embassy in the United Kingdom, on May 28, 1940, declaring that the French naval commander in Dunkirk requested the United Kingdom to provide more assistance in the naval and air forces. "I do not doubt that the British authorities cannot understand this need, but please urge its realization." Regarding this matter, Weygand sent a telegram to the French commander on May 30, 1940, reiterating the previous request. This is the 18th document. The telegram said, "At present, there are only three squadrons of fighter jets of the British Air Force on our territory, and the rest have returned to the United Kingdom. The center of the war is entirely on the shoulders of France. I respectfully appeal to your Commander-in-Chief in the name of the Commander-in-Chief of the French Army. I hope to understand the seriousness of the situation and take all necessary measures to dispatch large squadrons of fighter jets to France to participate in the war. I am very eager." Signed by Weygand."</p>
<p>The 19th document was a telegram from Weygand to the British Commander-in-Chief, after the French covered the British retreat from Dunkirk, declaring that the Dunkirk garrison commander requested the United Kingdom to transfer all available troops to the command of the French army, because the British army was able to withdraw entirely as a result of the heroic resistance of the French army to cover it, so he deeply hoped to accept this request, and that the British and French armies would cooperate effectively and no longer allow the French rearguard to sacrifice in vain.</p>
<p>The 20th document was a letter from Weygand to Prime Minister Reynaud on June 2, requesting Reynaud to quickly ask the United Kingdom to increase military assistance. The original letter is as follows: "Dear Prime Minister, our air force cannot provide sufficient support to the army. The situation is tight. I would like to urge the British Prime Minister to take action in this direction and await orders with bated breath." The letter was accompanied by a letter from General Villemin, Commander-in-Chief of the French Air Force, detailing the seriousness of the war situation, emphasizing that if British and French fighter jets could not intercept the activities of German bombers in large numbers, the German advance could not be contained. Since French aircraft must send a part to Southeast Africa to increase defense, unless the United Kingdom sends a large squadron of aircraft, the task of eliminating enemy bombers cannot be carried out. If this assistance cannot be obtained immediately, the French army may fail. Therefore, I believe that this is a struggle for the survival of Britain and France, and I deeply hope that this request can be realized immediately." (Haitong Telegraph, 5th)</p>

<p>Washington. US Interior Secretary Ickes delivered a shocking speech on Independence Day night, mocking those across the Atlantic who call themselves "supermen" and call Britain decadent. Although Ickes did not mention any names, it is generally believed that he was referring to Hitler and the Nazis. He said that these supermen have completely surrendered their will and body to the absolute will of the master who commands them how to act. They are willing to be humiliated and allow whippings and destruction. Freedom of speech, reading, and marriage have been lost. This superior and powerful people obey their master, violate promises and trample on peaceful lands, destroy the lives of children, and hope for undue gains. They willingly submit to the new God established by their dictators. If Lincoln listened to him, he would tell him that whoever wants to rule others is not enough to say this without obtaining the approval of that person. I wonder when these supermen will use these words to deal with their dictators. (Reuters, 5th)</p>

<h3 id="e41">Recent Work of the Institute of Physics, Peiping Academy <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>(Kunming Correspondence) Since the Institute of Physics of the National Peiping Academy moved to Yunnan, in addition to continuing some of the original research, it has been engaged in practical applications and physical research with local characteristics. The following is a brief description of the recent work:</p>
<p>(A) Regarding geophysics: (1) "Measurement of Gravitational Acceleration in Northwest Yunnan." Two years ago, the Institute sent assistant Zhang Hongji to Yunnan twice along the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway and the Jingdian Highway to measure gravitational acceleration. Last winter, Zhang Junfu set off along the Yunnan-Myanmar Highway to measure the gravitational acceleration of more than 40 places including Dali, Baoshan, Longling, Mangshi, Mengmao, Tengchong, Lijiang, and Xiangyun. The results were published in the French Academy of Sciences Weekly and submitted to the Seventh International Association of Geophysics and Geodesy held in Washington in September this year. (2) "Re-measurement of the Latitude and Longitude of Kunming." Using the altimeter of the Institute, Liu Chaoyang re-measured the results at Yunnan University as 102041'58"88 east longitude and 2503'22"05 north latitude. (3) "Geomagnetic Anomaly in Ciba, Kunming." The geomagnetic anomaly near Ciba is extremely large, with a difference of up to two degrees in declination within a few meters. After Gu Gongxu used a magnetometer to carefully measure Wenling, he determined that the anomaly was due to the surface red soil. (4) "Physical Exploration of the Yimen Iron Mine." Gu Gongxu is an expert in using geophysical methods to explore mineral deposits. After returning to China last autumn, he immediately engaged in the preparation of various methods and instruments. In September this year, he responded to the call of the Yimen Iron Mine Bureau of the Resources Committee and carried an electromagnetic instrument to work with Zhang Hongji.</p>
<p>(B) Regarding applied optics, the Institute originally established an optical workshop for the convenience of its own research and to promote this technology. Now, due to the needs, it is engaged in the manufacture of rangefinders and periscopes, and the design of photographic lenses and microscope lenses.</p>
<p>(C) Regarding optics: (1) Research on the ultraviolet absorption spectrum of salicylic acid and lithium salicylate vapor; (2) Research on the absorption spectrum of salicylic acid and its alkali metals; (3) The effect of pressure on X-ray photography. All of the above three works have yielded results and have recently been published in the French Academy of Sciences Weekly. (4) Atmospheric ozone observation.</p>
<p>(D) Regarding radio, continue the research on crystal column vibration and the supply of crystal oscillators for various radio stations in our country.</p>

<p>The fifth act of the United Cup Charity Basketball has extremely exciting programs today, with a total of two games. The first act starts at 5:30 pm (new time), with Xihua vs. Shangxing, which is also an exciting scene in Group A2. The finale is the reunion of the two giants of Paramount and Shanghai Youth. The two teams were the champions of the last Chinese and Western Youth Championships, which is already well known. Both sides have recently replenished their strength. Paramount has obtained the assistance of the tall player Bao Songyuan, and the lineup is even more abundant. On the Shanghai Youth side, because of the merger of Chen Xuechong, Shen Yugong, and Ren Xiangcheng from the former Hualian team, it is even more powerful. The outcome of today's reunion cannot be estimated based on the performance of the two sides in the Chinese and Western Youth Charity Basketball Tournament a few months ago. Paramount advocates a man-to-man strategy, and its smoke screen offensive and slow offensive strategy have particularly learned skills. In terms of individuals and cooperation, it is deeply rich in scientific meaning. On the Shanghai Youth side, in addition to Chen Xuechong being an old partner of Paramount, the other generals are actually a mixed product of Hualian and Guoguang. Hualian would have been a champion with the Northern School, so Shanghai Youth has formed a pure Northern School team. Today's reunion of the two giants should be the first exciting scene of the season. It is expected that the audience will definitely go crazy, unwilling to miss this feast for the eyes. Tickets are all one yuan. In order to maintain order, it will be limited to 400 tickets, which will be sold starting at 4:00 pm. Sales will stop as soon as the quota is full, but there are only 300 seats. Those who arrive first will be seated first, and those who arrive later can only stand and watch. The revenue from tickets for each game will be allocated to the expenses of the Orphanage. In order to reward the enthusiasm of the audience for donating generously, the hospital will still send a military band to the venue today to play music to adjust the atmosphere of the stadium. The program is as follows: Xihua vs. Shangxing (Group A2) 5:30 pm Wang Jien, Shanghai Youth vs. Paramount (Group A1) 6:30 pm Zhou Jiaqi, Qu Honglu, Paramount (Group A) Chen Xianglong, Lu Zhongen, Li Zhenzhong, Zhang Shaoqing, Wang Jinghu, Zhou Zhi, Feng Nianhua, Bao Songyuan, Lu Zhonghui, Sun Baoqing, Xu Wenkui,</p>

<p>— Chen Qingshi</p>
<p>— Written for this newspaper's summer essays by middle school and university students —</p>
<p>Mr. Chen is the head of the Chinese Education Department of the Public Concession's Bureau of Works. Regarding summer assignments for middle school and university students, he suggests collective research on pressing issues, selective reading of famous works, rotating reports, uniting like-minded individuals, visiting various institutions, understanding the reality of society, and striving to perform social services to eliminate illiteracy. These four points are all extremely valuable suggestions. No matter which point is written about in the submitted essay, it will be a work of substance. (Editor)</p>
<p>The question of whether or not school summer vacations should be abolished or shortened has sparked heated discussions in domestic education circles. Both proponents and opponents have considerable reasons for their positions. This issue will be put aside for now, but regardless, we should not let these two precious months pass in vain. I think everyone can agree with that. Summer vacation should not be spent idly playing, but should have fixed tasks. I would like to explain this from the following points:</p>
<p>1. From the Perspective of Learning: Learning either progresses or regresses. Some people use standardized tests to compare students' scores during and after summer vacation. The results show that the scores after summer vacation are worse, which is clear proof that learning either progresses or regresses. Modern youth are in a time of national crisis, and they should be striving to become stronger, uphold the spirit of continuous self-improvement, seek their own development, and prepare to serve society and the country in the future. Seeking enjoyment and comfort are things that young people should avoid at all costs.</p>
<p>2. From the Perspective of Health: A disciplined life and regular routines are essential for maintaining health. Students' lives in school can be said to meet the above conditions, but many people often lead chaotic lives during summer vacation. Their daily routines and schedules are irregular, resulting in listlessness and affecting their physical health. This is extremely inappropriate.</p>
<p>So how should young students use their summer vacation? Individuals have different circumstances and opportunities, so there cannot be a uniform regulation. The following types of tasks may be helpful for reference:</p>
<p>1. Group Research: Under the current school system, students spend most of their time on textbooks, while neglecting many issues that are of great concern to young people or in which they have a deep interest. This is inherently wrong. I think students can use the summer vacation to gather like-minded classmates and organize discussion groups. In a relatively free environment and a more lively atmosphere, they can study and discuss these important issues. In order to make this kind of discussion group successful, a detailed plan must be made in advance regarding the issue to be discussed, the scope of the discussion, the collection of materials, and the participants, so as to avoid making hasty preparations and doing things perfunctorily.</p>
<p>2. Selected Readings of Famous Works: Students in school spend all day holding several textbooks, but have no time to explore many famous works that everyone should read. This is a pity. Students can use the summer vacation to select several famous works under the guidance of teachers, exchange readings, and report in turn. I think they will definitely gain a lot.</p>
<p>3. Collective Visits: Shanghai has a plethora of institutions. Students who are usually confined within the walls of the school can use the summer vacation to organize visiting groups and visit various institutions in turn to increase their understanding of society.</p>
<p>4. Social Service: A social service work that young students should do within their capacity during the summer vacation is to eliminate illiteracy. There are so many illiterate people in our country that unless the entire intellectual class (including students) is mobilized, it is impossible to eliminate illiteracy. This is an obligation that we educated people owe to society, and a responsibility that cannot be shirked.</p>

<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw no changes in HSBC's listed prices. The black market for British and American currencies continued to weaken. The US dollar was seen at 6.375 yuan. Speculators and Chinese banks were unanimously selling pounds for multiple times around the four shillings level outside the customs. Other foreign banks were eager to supply, so prices were repeatedly lowered. In the morning, because HSBC still had an appetite for buying, foreign firms took advantage of the low prices to settle, and there was a brief rebound. However, because the market was flooded with chips, the result was still weak. The market situation in the afternoon was quite calm, with very little trading activity, and the price was slightly soft, but eventually stabilized. There were various rumors in the market, but they were not taken seriously by operators, so there was no reaction. At the close, British gold was at 3 shillings 953125, and the US dollar was at 6.3125 yuan, up 0.015625 and 0.0325 respectively compared to the previous day. The trend of futures was the same.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the morning, the London price fell nearly 0.03125 yuan. American banks were closed, and London spot gold was fixed. The exchange rate of British currency against the US dollar was unchanged, but it was up 0.03125 yuan against Shanghai. There was no report for France.

Banks opened in the morning with spot selling prices of 3 shillings 9375 for British gold and 6.28125 yuan for the US dollar. Compared to the previous day's close, both British and American currencies were flat. After opening, in addition to the unusually eager supply from American banks, Chinese banks followed suit by dumping and speculating, and speculators were very enthusiastic about selling. The market immediately showed signs of weakness. HSBC's listed price was announced and remained unchanged. The silver equalization tax was announced and there were no increases or decreases. At that time, the July US dollar was traded at 6.3125 yuan offered by American banks, while speculators and Chinese banks sold spot US dollars to foreign banks at 6.375 yuan. The July US dollar was also traded at 6.3115 yuan. The spot pound was absorbed by HSBC from speculators at 3 shillings 96875. Later, foreign banks and Chinese banks continued to sell, but HSBC bought in from time to time. Soon, foreign firms saw low prices and came to settle, and the underlying trend turned from weak to soft. The spot US dollar was traded by foreign firms withdrawing from foreign banks at 6.25 yuan, and the July US dollar was reported at 6.1875 yuan. Spot British gold was seen at 3 shillings 921875.

<h3 id="e52">US Dollar Fluctuates <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market saw British and American gold pounds ultimately weaken due to "shia chik" (cash settlement), so they both continued to fall by one yuan. The supply and demand for British gold notes was still even in the morning, but the selling pressure was slightly stronger in the afternoon, and the market price eventually fell by five jiao. The American gold note fell first and then rose, and after rising, it fell again, and finally rebounded again. The result was the same as the day before. The supply of Japanese gold notes was quite smooth in the morning, and the market price fell. In the afternoon, the demand was strong again, and the market price rebounded, eventually reporting a slight increase of 0.001 yuan. The black market price was 1.136 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e53">Hong Kong Group Suddenly Buys Gold; 5,000 Yuan Barrier Broken Three Times and Then Rebounded <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's cash "shia chik" (cash settlement) black market situation, inheriting the tired momentum from the previous day, fell miserably into the 5,000 yuan barrier, creating a recent new low of 4,950 yuan. This was because people's hearts were decayed, and there were occasional cases of painful settlements after many households suffered losses. It opened at 5,050 yuan in the early morning, down 80 yuan. Subsequently, after the gold shops dumped, it broke into the 5,000 yuan barrier, first seeing a low of 4,950 yuan. However, at that time, those who saw low prices and wanted to buy were also quite crowded. For example, the Hong Kong group of securities companies and a certain jewelry store entered the market to buy, pulling up to 5,080 yuan for the second time. Although it fell again later, the Hong Kong group and a certain household still absorbed it, rising to 5,130 yuan. Unfortunately, many overnight households and money exchange businesses suddenly dumped a lot, resulting in the afternoon close of only 5,035 yuan. After the afternoon opening, the Hong Kong group continued to buy, from 5,050 yuan to 5,070 yuan. Before long, the silver firms sold, falling to 560 yuan. Fortunately, the Hong Kong group worked tirelessly to pull it up, and it rose to 5,105 yuan before the close. The result was 5,095 yuan, down 35 yuan from the previous day. The entire day's transactions were about 4,000 taels. The jewelry gold hung down 10 yuan, and the customs gold, etc., remained flat.</p>
<p>"Shia Chik" Only Down 35 Yuan</p>
<p>Since the morning, the exchange rate reported stronger for each bar (10 taels), and people's hearts were extremely tired. The market opened with a sharp drop of 80 yuan. The silver firm paid the money exchange business 10 taels, for 5,050 yuan. Subsequently, under the selling pressure from gold shops and silver firms, it plummeted another 100 yuan, miserably entering the 5,000 yuan barrier. The silver firm entered the gold shop for 10 taels, inferior to 4,950 yuan. Later, a certain jewelry store saw the low price and frantically bought on behalf of the Hong Kong group. At the same time, a certain gold shop was also happy to absorb it, and then it rebounded by 130 yuan. The silver firms made deals with each other for 10 taels, for 5,080 yuan. However, before long, the buying momentum gradually dissipated, and a certain money exchange business tended to sell, and the price fell again, again entering within 5,000 yuan. The gold shop paid the silver firm 20 taels, retreating to 4,960 yuan. After this, the exchange market suddenly reported a shift to tight, which immediately stimulated considerable buying momentum. In the midst of silver firms and gold shops pulling, it rebounded again by 170 yuan. The silver firms mutually made deals for 20 taels, for 5,130 yuan. Unexpectedly, at that time, the foreign exchange market reported a loosening again, and money exchange businesses and securities groups rushed to sell, and casual observers also sold. It was lowered again by 130 yuan. The gold shop paid the silver firm 20 taels, reducing to 5,000 yuan. At noon, the selling momentum slightly subsided, and it rebounded by 35 yuan. The money exchange business entered the silver firm for 30 taels, using 5,035 yuan as the noon closing price. The situation was still good when the market opened in the afternoon, and it was immediately raised by 15 yuan. The money exchange business entered the silver firm for 20 taels, for 5,050 yuan. Subsequently, because a certain jewelry store had a considerable appetite, it rose another 20 yuan. The silver firms mutually made deals for 50 taels, for 5,070 yuan. Soon, a certain silver firm and securities group vigorously sold, and at that time, a certain jewelry store stopped its activities, causing it to decline slightly by 55 yuan. The money exchange business paid the gold shop 30 taels for 5,015 yuan. After entering, a certain jewelry store's buying intentions rekindled, and some money exchange businesses, gold shops, and securities groups came to search and buy, and they immediately swarmed to the 5,100 yuan barrier. The gold shop entered the silver firm for 20 taels, rising to 5,105 yuan. Before the close, the money exchange business slightly dumped, rebounding by 10 yuan. The money exchange business paid the gold shop 10 taels, for 5,095 yuan, using it as the evening closing price. The result was 35 yuan less than the previous day. The total daily range was 180 yuan. The cash shop's own brand gold selling price, according to "shia chik," was more than 10 yuan higher, and the buying price was reduced by 30 yuan. Currently, the standard gold is more than 50 yuan lower than the listed gold, and there is very little trading.</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold Also Lingered Down 10 Yuan</p>
<p>At the beginning, the gold for jewelry from the major firms was still suspended at 530 yuan per tael. Around 10:00 AM, it hung down 10 yuan. At 11:00 AM, it rebounded by 10 yuan. At noon, it hung down again by 10 yuan. There were no changes in the afternoon. It is estimated that the major firms changed the suspension to 520 yuan. The new firms were the same as the above prices. The buying price was reduced by about 30 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e54">Securities: Category D Stocks Show Particularly Strong Gains <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>The black market for securities continued to be good yesterday, especially with the particularly strong gains in Category D stocks. After the market price trended upwards, all bonds had already risen a lot, but Category D stocks were still relatively cheap, so they were particularly favored by bullish investors. They suddenly rose about one yuan compared to the previous day, which can be said to be an unprecedented honor for Category D stocks. However, in the afternoon, there was suddenly no market, and it was still in its usual desolate state. There were not many changes in the environment. There has been no official report on Song Ziwen's loan negotiations with the United States, and it is still uncertain. According to the sudden arrival of this upward trend, the fundamental reason is that the principal and interest are about to expire soon. Initially, after a certain bank bought hundreds of thousands, there were rumors of a loan. The surface was also biased towards bullish sentiment. In the past two days, new customers have bought 200,000 to 300,000, so the market price has gradually trended upward in mutual support. However, the gains in Category D stocks have been too rapid, and it is feared that losses are inevitable. Yesterday's transactions were mainly bought by Xie Xingyuan from morning to afternoon for 200,000 to 300,000. Sheng Daxingyuan Chang followed. In the afternoon, Tianfeng Hengfu Renchang and others also bought one after another. Hongkang and No. 16 sold throughout the day. Jiufeng and No. 22 also sold. Lianyi advanced first and then exited, and the trend was strong first and then stabilized. The future may be raised again before more bulls emerge. As a result, all equity shares continued to rise by 0.15 to 0.8 yuan. The total number of transactions was less than one million yuan. A brief table is listed below:</p>
<p>Stock trading: 50 shares of Hanyeping shares were traded at a price of 3.9 yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday's stock market at the Public Industry Exchange was extremely quiet, with few transactions and no price changes.</p>
<p>London, 4th (Thursday) Telegram: Today's listed prices of Far East British companies' stocks were generally flat. HSBC Bank shares continued to rebound. British registered shares continued to rise by 3 pounds, with a price of 63 pounds. Hong Kong registered shares continued to rise by 2 pounds, with a price of 65 pounds. The rest remained unchanged.</p>
<p>London, 4th (Thursday) Telegram: Today's listed prices of Chinese foreign debt remained stable. There were no changes in any of the high and low grade bonds.</p>
<h3 id="e55">Yarn and Cotton: Japanese Merchants Purchase Chinese Yarn and Rumored to Be Transporting It to South China for Sale <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market is calm, not escaping its hovering state. However, actual sales are still quite substantial. Hong Kong and Yunnan groups continue to purchase relentlessly, so people's hearts are relatively stable. Market rumors say that yarn mills are automatically reducing work due to the hot summer weather, and business can be reduced. Some people believe that the shortage of cotton yarn chips may cause the market to rebound. In addition, the futures market is not doing well, and the market's inertia is becoming more stable.</p>
<p>The current yarn market opened in the morning due to a poor environment, a looser foreign exchange rate, and a falling gold price. The opening price of 20-count Double Horse yarn fell by 10 yuan to 870 yuan, and continued to fall to 860 yuan. Later, it was heard that Hong Kong's demand was still strong, and people's hearts were revived. The market gradually rose, closing at 885 yuan. It is also said that Japanese merchants transport Chinese yarn to South China for sale, and the profits are very high. The writer slightly inquired about this matter. According to a certain broker, a certain Japanese merchant foreign firm (tiger style) purchased about 100 to 200 bales of 23-count Golden Rooster, Dafeng, and 10-count Special Jincheng. It is still difficult to determine whether this cargo is transported to Guangzhou Bay. However, the people's hearts in the market were a sensation for a while. It was found that the turnover statistics for half a day were 2,425 bales, and the market price of 20-count Double Horse yarn fell by 2 yuan. Today, 130 pieces were shipped to Hong Kong. The amount of purchases by each group is listed on the left:</p>
<h3 id="e56">The Cotton Market Is Extremely Quiet <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>The current cotton situation is still as stagnant as ever. Chinese mills have very little demand, but Japanese merchant foreign firms have slightly purchased transactions to be shipped to Japanese mills. However, the amount is very small. The price of Kanggang cotton is 175 yuan, and the delivery price to the factory is 173 yuan, which is a stock exchange transaction of 200 pieces. The future of the cotton market is still difficult to be optimistic about, because the cotton purchased by all parties is coming in steadily, and the money supply is tight.</p>
<p>In other news, the market price of foreign cotton and the New York cotton market were closed all day yesterday for the American Independence Day. The Indian cotton market rose by 2.5 rupees due to purchases by speculators.</p>
<p>The trading of foreign cotton in Shanghai was extremely quiet from beginning to end. It is widely rumored in the market that Japanese merchants are searching for domestic yarn in the market, and as a result, the price of yarn has risen. The cotton market may also be brought up.</p>
<h3 id="e57">Grain: Nearly 40,000 Bags of Rice Arrive from Hong Kong; Foreign Rice Has a Situation of Breaking the New Price Limit <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>After the rice market tightened again the other day, people's hearts were still firm when the market opened yesterday morning, not feeling discouraged by the continuous arrival of foreign rice. Instead, they seized the opportunity to support it, and shouts rose one after another. At the same time, general floating speculators and speculators who had been missing for many days suddenly took the lead in major activities, absorbing it in every possible way, stimulating the situation to become more turbulent. The market prices of various foreign rice rose step by step, reaching a peak in an instant, reaching the closing limit line of June 29. At this point, there was no further rise possible, and the overall situation began to stabilize. Sales gradually slowed down, and the profitable goods in hand were released one after another. However, as the market was about to close, there was a lack of opponents, so there was no much change. Only a rebound of 0.2 to 0.3 yuan was seen. As a result, the closing prices were 66 yuan, 65.7 yuan for No. 1 Aged Saigon, 64.5 yuan for No. 2, 65.8 yuan, 65 yuan for No. 1 Siam, 64.5 yuan for No. 2, 65.2 yuan for Fire-Refined, 63.2 yuan for Small-Refined, 62 yuan, 61.5 yuan for Tokyo Broken Tip, 53 yuan to 51.5 yuan for Mixed Broken, and 57 yuan to 54 yuan for Rice Green, which was 0.6 to 0.7 yuan higher than the previous day's closing price. Futures for repayment were especially competed for by both sides. The opening price of No. 2 Siamese rice for June 6 jumped out to 70 yuan to 70.05 yuan, and then rose to 71 yuan, which was 2 yuan higher than the previous day. The opening price of 18-packing was 74 yuan, and then from 74.5 yuan to 75 yuan, which was a huge 3 yuan higher. There were profits returned in the noon market, and the futures market's upward trend had stopped. However, the buying sentiment for spot goods turned weak after the high prices because of the large number of imports in recent days, and there were still whole batches on the way. The noon close was slightly suppressed by 0.3 to 0.5 yuan. Actual sales for the entire day were very strong, with 13,000 to 14,000 bags of spot rice and more than 300 tons of futures opened.</p>
<p>A large amount of foreign rice arrived in Shanghai. The Taikoo Company's Suiyang Wheel arrived in Shanghai at noon, transporting 19,239 bags from Hong Kong and mooring at its own dock in Pudong to unload. Around 2:00 PM, the Taiyuan Wheel also arrived at the port, also loaded with 20,430 bags from Hong Kong, and moored at its own dock on the Bund in the French Concession to unload. Yesterday, the two wheels transported a total of 39,669 bags of foreign rice, a huge amount.</p>
<p>Although there is no source of glutinous rice in the interior, the sales are not as good as the previous day due to the continuous rise in prices, so the situation has turned flat. It is estimated that the opening price of Jinli Baiyuan is still 65 yuan, and Changdan Baiyuan is 634 yuan. However, Hong Kong glutinous rice is in short supply in the market and has a wider path, and it has always taken the lead with foreign rice, sharply increasing by about 2 yuan to an opening price of 67 yuan.</p>
<p>More than a thousand bags of domestic rice such as thick and thin japonica rice continued to arrive at the port. It is rumored that the off-market black market is being suppressed by the continuous arrival of goods in recent days, and people's hearts are calm, making it difficult to compete with foreign rice. The Changbang Special Qing Japonica is still at the original price of 73.5 yuan, 73 yuan, Sukun Changzhou Japonica is 712 yuan, and the next lowest Suxiu is 69 yuan. Thin rice has not been traded at all. Nangang Early Rice is especially 71 yuan 70 yuan, and Zhongguan is still at 69 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e58">Fuxin Temporarily Stops Supplying Flour; Wheat Transportation to Shanghai Is Still Difficult to Smooth <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>Flour: Yesterday's spot flour market situation was even firmer, because the raw materials of the Chinese mills were insufficient. The Fuxin Mill suddenly stopped supplying flour from yesterday, relying only on Fufeng to maintain it alone. The daily wholesale volume was also 5,000 to 6,000 bags. The old brand mill remained at the original price of 15.2 yuan. The factory is quite enthusiastic about the future of people's food, but currently there is no way to buy new wheat in large quantities. Although foreign wheat can be ordered, there are concerns about the arrival of goods in the future. If this continues, it is very worrying. It is heard that the concession authorities are trying to dredge wheat transportation to Shanghai, but it may be difficult to realize in the shortest term. The supply of factory flour is insufficient, and the opportunity for domestic Japanese factory flour to be sold is even better. It is heard that Shuangshi, Jinshan and other flour are being transported in continuously, with prices at 16.1 to 16.2 yuan, and futures at 16.5 to 16.6 yuan. Several thousand bags were traded for each.</p>
<p>Wheat: Yesterday's new wheat sources were still scarce. Except for a certain party directly handling the solution, it has been impossible to transport to Shanghai what Chinese merchants have completed in various places so far, so formal transactions in the market cannot be started for a while. Recently, a batch of transportation permits being negotiated in Wuhu has not had an official response, so the Chinese Fufu factories have proposed to continue ordering Australian foreign wheat, with a total price of about 30 yuan per 100 catties.</p>
<h3 id="e59">Drought Causes Soybean Cakes to Be Unsalable; Market Is Potentially Becoming Stable <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's soybean cake market situation was due to sunny weather with no rain, which affected the fertilization of crops, so all parties felt uninterested in buying. Only stockpilers and Shantou Xinghua's interior gang were still active, but the transaction has been reduced compared to before, causing the market to be slightly uneven, so the potential trend is temporarily becoming stable. It is estimated that 3,000 pieces of Dayou Yu Four Brand Cake were traded, with a price of 13.85 to 13.9 yuan. 7,000 pieces of Shengji cake were traded, with spot prices of 13.1 to 13.3 yuan, and 13.3 to 13.35 yuan for delivery in the first half of July. Yuanlong cake was priced at 13 yuan. 3,000 pieces of Tongzhou Small Soybean Cake were priced at 20.05 yuan per 100 market catties.</p>
<p>Also, 400 cans of raw oil came from Yantai yesterday, and 250 cans came from Qingdao. As for export goods, there were 300 bags of soybeans transported to Hong Kong today.</p>

<p>Yesterday's sugar market saw a fall in Dutch production prices, continuing to drop by about 1 yuan. According to reports, the rough white price for the K.G.C.I.F example was 5.07 US dollars, and the Dutch red price for the same example was 4.12 US dollars. The association's divided spot price for 24 rough white in this warehouse was 67.8 yuan, down 1.2 yuan, and 67.34 to 67.5 yuan in foreign warehouses, down 0.6 yuan, and 52.8 to 53 yuan for re-export, down 1 yuan.

DY Mark West Warehouse was 76 yuan, and Dutch red was 57 yuan, down 0.3 yuan. This snow white was 68 yuan, down 0.1 yuan, this No. 1 ice was 90.5 yuan, and Jingming ice was 92 yuan, both down 0.5 yuan. There were no transactions in domestic sugar.</p>
<p>Also, 300 bags of sugar came from Hong Kong yesterday.</p>

<p>100 bags of Jinan Fuhong dates arrived before, and were priced at 38 yuan, but no deal was made after holding for many days. It was heard yesterday that 50 bags had been opened for sale, with a price of 36 yuan in cash, up 1 yuan from before.

<p>The source of Western sea cucumber has been quiet recently, causing the bottom to gradually become thin. As for Chiyu ginseng, another batch was opened yesterday, and the number was small. The result was as follows: the opening price for Chiban was 219 yuan, No. 1 Chichi was 209 yuan, No. 2 Chichi was 193 yuan, No. 3 Chichi was 183 yuan, No. 4 Chichi was 174 yuan, No. 5 Chichi was 148 yuan, the opening price for Chuban jade was 375 yuan, No. 1 jade was 365 yuan, No. 2 was 345 yuan, No. 3 jade was 340 yuan, No. 4 jade was 330 yuan, and No. 5 jade was 396 yuan. The future is still considered firm and high.</p>

<p>The Hong Kong gang has been moving to handle dried fish recently, and because there is a lack of high-quality goods in the market, the selling price has continued to rise. Currently, the opening price is 120 yuan to 117 yuan, which is 135 yuan higher than the previous market. Secondly, Ningbo goods are still flat.</p>
<h3 id="e64">Piece Goods: Stockpilers of Cotton Cloth Dump; Selling Prices Continue to Fall <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>Domestic Cloth: The market was still soft yesterday, and the selling price fell slightly. This was because the industry and stockpilers tended to sell, and the current sales volume was not large. The white goods, coarse and fine cloth, and twill continued to fall by 0.1 to 0.25 yuan per piece. The selling price of bleached and dyed cloth was even more chaotic. A part continued to fall by 0.25 to 0.5 yuan. About 200 pieces of coarse cloth, twill, and Luen Chang patterned goods were handled by the Zhoudong Wenyong gang. The wholesale number in this street traded 10,000 pieces of grey cloth, coarse cloth, poplin, western yarn, bleached cloth, and thread flannel. Purchasing from the guerrilla zones in Suzhou, Zhejiang, and Anhui continued uninterrupted, but there was a lack of wholesale transactions.</p>
<p>East Cloth: Because the standard gold continued to fall in the morning market, the selling pressure was even stronger, and fine cloth saw a new low price. The closing price of 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth fell to 27.6 yuan, gradually approaching the middle-grade brands. The sales of Four Gentlemen Serge Wood Street were still good, and the industry had a lot of buyers, so it only fell by 0.01 yuan, closing at 0.825 yuan.</p>
<p>Export: There were 15 pieces of piece goods transported to Hong Kong today, and 100 pieces transported to Yantai, and 50 pieces transported to Weihaiwei.</p>

<p>The price of flannel has soared several times recently. First-quality British-made flannel is selling for thirty-six or thirty-seven yuan, second-quality for twenty-seven or twenty-eight yuan, and Renli domestic flannel for twenty-two yuan. White first-quality flannel has reached forty yuan and second-quality thirty-six or thirty-seven yuan, which can be considered the peak. Upon investigation, there have been no new arrivals or orders placed recently, and the market inventory is limited, so those holding goods are hoarding them. However, the actual sales volume has decreased by half compared to previous years due to the high prices. As a result, current transactions are mostly small and sporadic, with few whole batches being traded. Therefore, the standard lacks stability.</p>
<h3 id="e66">Metals: Black Iron Billets Listless and Inactive <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>Recently, both local and foreign markets have shown little interest in black iron billets. The local thermos factories are experiencing extremely slow sales due to the hot weather, so they have little need for raw materials, including black iron billets. In addition, factories producing mirrors, printed goods, and cans are also buying less. The market is thus inactive. Furthermore, with the tense situation in Southeast Asia, overseas merchants are unlikely to be interested in purchasing. Merchants from Tianjin, Qingdao, and Yantai have also significantly reduced their buying due to the summer heat. Consequently, traders are offering more flexible prices, selling at around nine hundred and fifty yuan per piece. Today, one thousand five hundred pieces of tinplate were shipped to Tianjin.</p>
<h3 id="e67">Silk and Tea: Raw Silk Plunges, Local Silk Transactions Sporadic <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, there was no market in New York due to Independence Day. Yokohama spot prices were one thousand three hundred and sixty yuan, down twenty yuan. Near-term prices were one thousand four hundred and thirteen yuan, down twenty-one yuan. Distant-term prices were one thousand four hundred and two yuan, down twenty-six yuan. Overseas silk prices seem to have shifted from stagnation to downward pressure.</p>
<p>Local foreign firms only had sporadic transactions, mostly restocking. Yesterday, ten bundles of 7-8 quality white factory silk were sold at four thousand five hundred yuan. Indian foreign firms' filature silk and reeled silk sold well yesterday. The market situation is generally similar to last month. Approximately seventy bundles were traded.</p>
<p>Yesterday, one thousand three hundred and twenty-seven chests of tea arrived from Hong Kong.</p>
<h3 id="e68">June: New York Silk Sales Decline Sharply <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>The New York raw silk market in June saw a continued contraction in imports and sales. Compared to the same month last year, imports and sales were lower, and inventories increased sharply. Therefore, this year's silk prices have not risen as sharply as in previous years. On the contrary, the future of silk prices is bleak and unlikely to improve. June's raw silk imports decreased by four thousand seven hundred and forty bales compared to the previous month, sales decreased by one thousand six hundred and ninety bales, and inventories increased by one thousand four hundred and sixty-three bales.</p>
<p>Compared to the same month in previous years, imports decreased by five thousand four hundred and eighteen bales, about one-third, sales decreased by eight thousand nine hundred and thirty-nine bales, about one-half, and inventories increased by twenty-two thousand six hundred and thirteen bales, an increase of more than two hundred percent.</p>

<h3 id="e70">Gunfire Heard from Longhua Yesterday Morning: Explosions Shake Shanghai; Shelling Beginning at 4:30 AM Lasting Half an Hour; Loud Explosions Arouse Residents <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday morning at 4:30 AM, intense machine gun fire and artillery explosions, interspersed with sporadic rifle shots, suddenly erupted near the South Station. Residents in both foreign concessions were startled awake and climbed onto rooftops or balconies to see what was happening, but they saw nothing. After about half an hour, it became quiet. The Central News Agency reporter inquired in various places. A senior official from the French police stated that he had not heard anything and knew nothing. A spokesman for the Japanese embassy said that he had not heard anything either and could not provide any information, but he denied that the gunfire was due to a conflict between Japanese troops and Chinese guerrillas. He said it could have been Japanese military exercises or the apprehension of thieves.</p>
<p>Japanese Side Claims Military Exercise</p>
<p>The English-language "China Press" reported that loud explosions, machine-gun fire, and rifle shots were heard from Longhua and western Shanghai from 5:00 AM to 7:00 AM this morning (the 5th), and were clearly audible. The Japanese authorities denied reports of guerrilla warfare in the area, claiming that the gunfire was due to Japanese military exercises in the Longhua area.</p>
<p>Residents Awakened, Details Unclear</p>
<p>According to a person who came from western Shanghai speaking to a reporter from the Dagong News Agency, the Japanese dispatched the "Naval Department" and the "Hai Xing Military Ship" to Shanghai, and transferred the "Peace and National Salvation Army" to be stationed in the suburbs of Shanghai. Recently, they have been building barracks, and the Japanese army sends a large number of military trucks every day to load bricks and stones in the South Station and Hongkou to transport them to build on their own, seemingly intending to stay for a long time. Large numbers of Chinese guerrilla troops have also arrived in Shanghai recently. Yesterday (the 5th) around 4:00 AM, intense machine gun fire suddenly erupted near Longhua in southern Shanghai, mixed with rifle shots, sometimes intense and sometimes sporadic, until it stopped at 5:15 AM. Residents in the city of South Station were all startled awake.</p>

<p>Invisible Martial Law Tonight, Special Defense Tomorrow</p>
<p>China's long-term war of resistance against Japan has suddenly gone through three years of trials, and it has become increasingly firm, indomitable, and courageous. Tomorrow is the third anniversary of the Lugou Bridge Incident. In order to prevent accidents, the Shanghai Municipal Council's Police Department will implement invisible martial law starting tonight, and special precautions will be taken tomorrow. From 4:00 AM, iron wire barricades will be placed at various important locations, and all large and small hotels and public places suspected of harboring undesirable elements will be searched. All special Municipal Council police officers will be mobilized, and troops from various countries will also be deployed for emergency defense. The various precautions are the same as last year and include the mobilization of a portion of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps. According to a spokesman for the Shanghai Municipal Council, under these strict precautions, it is hoped that no unexpected incidents will occur.</p>

<p>Danish Cargo Ship Arrives in Shanghai</p>
<p>Shipping between Shanghai and Vietnam is limited to Jardine Matheson's "Tai Shan" which sailed to Haiphong on Thursday afternoon with 300 passengers. Whether it will reach its destination is unknown. If it cannot reach Haiphong, passengers may have to disembark in Hong Kong. Butterfield &amp; Swire's "Sichuan", which normally has Haiphong as its destination, departed Shanghai yesterday but will only go as far as Hong Kong. Some smaller vessels continue to travel between Hong Kong and Annam. The Danish cargo ship "Afrika," which sailed from Copenhagen before Denmark surrendered to Germany, was detained by the British authorities in Colombo for nearly two months. It is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai this afternoon or tomorrow morning. Shipping industry sources announced yesterday that the ship flew the British flag after leaving Colombo, and it is likely that an agreement has been reached between the British naval authorities and the shipowner. The ship has no passengers and carries a large quantity of paper and other Danish products. After arriving in Shanghai, it will dock at the Wheelock &amp; Co. Wharf.</p>

<p>Evidence of Rampant Speculation</p>
<p>The dynamics of the bill market reflect the prosperity or decline of commerce and financial activity. Since the war, Shanghai has seen a concentration of funds and a rise in speculation, making the bill market very busy. The amount of bill clearing has also increased. According to reliable statistics, the amount of bill clearing in May and June of this year has reached 30 million yuan per month, an average of 10 million yuan per day. This surge in bill clearing reflects the abnormal state of Shanghai's commerce and the continued rampant speculation.</p>
<h3 id="e75">Japanese Conduct Large-Scale Search in French Concession Yesterday; Two Chinese Arrested and Still in Custody for Investigation <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>At 6:00 AM yesterday, the Japanese suddenly dispatched more than a dozen plainclothes personnel in vehicles to the French Concession Police Station on Rue Cardinal Mercier, along with more than twenty Chinese and foreign detectives from the police department, who departed in batches to various destinations for searches. This action lasted a long time before it ended.</p>
<p>Two People Arrested</p>
<p>After much inquiry by reporters from the news agency, it was learned that the search involved multiple locations. The residence of an accountant at 355 Route Tenant de la Tour was searched, and he was arrested. The Zhonghui Bank on Avenue Edward VII was also searched. At the same time, the private residences of Xu Maotang, the bank manager, at Lane 116, No. 6 on Rue Amiral Courbet and No. 65 on Avenue Petain were also searched. As a result, Xu was also arrested.</p>
<p>Still in Custody</p>
<p>In addition, traffic was cut off for about two hours at the intersection of Avenue Petain and Route Albert, and the area around Route Massenet was also searched, but nothing was found. The two people arrested are still in custody, awaiting investigation. According to reports, the accountant has an office on Avenue Edward VII. Xu Maotang is from Ningbo and used to be a broker at the Cotton Cloth Exchange. He is now a shareholder and manager of Zhonghui Bank. According to a public announcement from the French police, yesterday morning (the 5th), the French police received a report that improper conduct had occurred at the Zhonghui Bank on Avenue Edward VII. After sending officers to investigate, two shareholders of the bank are now in the Central Police Station awaiting investigation.</p>
<p>Another Case</p>
<p>Also, it was reported that before the Japanese, along with French police officers, conducted the search and arrests in the French Concession yesterday morning, Mr. Xu Muxing was also kidnapped by someone on the 3rd of this month, and there is still no news of his release. This is the third time Xu Mu has disappeared.</p>
<p>Western Press Reports</p>
<p>The English-language "China Press" reported that the agreement established last week between the French and Japanese authorities in this city was implemented this morning (the 5th). Early this morning, several vehicles carrying Japanese troops arrived at the Zhaojia Bang Police Station on Rue Pichon and, after a brief wait, joined the French Concession police to conduct large-scale searches throughout the Concession. The well-known wealthy businessman Xu Maotang and an accountant were arrested and taken to Hongkou by the Japanese. The Zhonghui Bank building on Avenue Edward VII was also searched this morning by Japanese troops and French police. They also went to Xu Maotang's concubine's residence on Rue Amiral Courbet and then to Xu's residence on Avenue Petain to arrest Xu Maotang. The accountant was arrested at his residence on Route Tenant de la Tour.</p>
<h3 id="e76">National Products Sales in Southeast Asia Affected; Deliberating on Solutions <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>Malaya Strengthens Foreign Exchange Controls</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese are very enthusiastic about using national products. According to statistics, there are more than 250 companies engaged in the national products business, of which silk and cotton fabrics are already restricted and are now becoming even more restricted. Large quantities of cotton textiles are being imported. Electrical appliances and light bulbs are subject to strict inspection upon import, and wires are not allowed to be imported. Leather goods are mainly suitcases. Cosmetics have also been continuously shipped for sale in recent years. Therefore, the current changes in the European situation and the tense situation in the Far East are extremely important for the export of Shanghai's entire national products industry. The national products industry in this city is currently deliberating on solutions to alleviate the dire situation. Since the outbreak of the European war last year, the British government of Malaya has controlled import and export foreign exchange based on the British wartime national defense financial regulations to consolidate the economy of Malaya. Subsequently, as the war expanded, the management of import and export foreign exchange has become increasingly strict, such as reducing the amount of remittances for household expenses by overseas Chinese from 500 Singapore dollars to 250 Singapore dollars. Foreign exchange controls have recently been tightened again. The notice to banks stipulates that: (1) Remittances to countries not in the sterling bloc are not allowed without the permission of the foreign exchange control officer. However, banks can continue to remit up to 250 yuan per transaction according to the needs of local businesses. However, all remittance approvals obtained before the publication of this notice that have not yet been remitted will be canceled. (2) Residents living abroad are not allowed to withdraw funds from their bank accounts within the colony, unless they obtain the permission of the foreign exchange control officer. The national products industry in this city has received these measures separately.</p>

<p>According to the American Embassy yesterday, US Ambassador Johnson was originally scheduled to fly to Hong Kong on China National Aviation Corporation on July 4 after commemorating Independence Day in Chongqing. However, due to the repeated air raids on Chongqing, the ambassador has been caring for American expatriates and handling unfinished business. Therefore, this office has not yet received a telegram from the ambassador. It is speculated that his trip to Shanghai and the north will be postponed.</p>
<p>British Expatriate Service, Draft Measures</p>
<p>Regarding the "war service plan" mentioned by the British Ambassador on the radio last week, the New Voice News Agency learned from the embassy that the plan is currently being drafted and may be released as early as next Monday. The reporter then inquired about the ambassador's travel plans to the north. It was reported that there is no definite date yet.</p>
<p>Italian Ambassador Traveled North Yesterday</p>
<p>Italian Ambassador Marquis returned to his original residence in the French Concession at the beginning of the French-Italian armistice. The ambassador's private residence is now heavily guarded, with Vietnamese French police stationed at the gate. All entering and exiting attendants use the back door. Ambassador Marquis left Shanghai by train yesterday to travel north to Beidaihe for summer vacation, canceling the plan to travel by ship. Before leaving, the ambassador sent out a large number of printed materials.</p>

The issue of labor services for British expatriate conscription offices in this city is still under discussion and is expected to be resolved and announced soon. The association decided to continue the meeting on the afternoon of the 16th to continue the discussion.</p>

<h3 id="e82">All Land Bureau Files Transferred to Jiangwan Yesterday; Departing Under Strict Shanghai Municipal Council Security; Property Rights Disputes Will Continue to Arise <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council, formally entrusted by the Chinese government to keep the Land Bureau files in custody, has finally disregarded the protests of the Chinese side and the revulsion of righteous people at home and abroad, and arbitrarily handed them over to a third party without legal status, and made a completely inappropriate "transfer" yesterday morning. At 8:55 AM yesterday morning, Sato, a senior consul from the Japanese Consulate General, accompanied by the pseudo "Land Bureau Director" Fan, official Chen, and pseudo "Municipal Government" representatives Yang and Wu, visited Shanghai Municipal Council Secretary General Fessenden, and then went to Room A506 of the Shanghai Municipal Council building (the secret location where the Land Bureau files were stored, the room had been walled off, and the walls had been removed by the Bureau beforehand), under the supervision of the Police Department's reserve team personnel, completing one of the most poignant chapters in the history of the Shanghai Land Bureau.</p>
<p>Shanghai Municipal Council's Official Announcement</p>
<p>According to the Shanghai Municipal Council's information office, the transfer of the former Land Bureau files through the Japanese Consul General was carried out by the Bureau this morning (the 5th). The transfer was completed by noon.</p>
<p>Recalling the Past, As If It Were Today</p>
<p>The "transfer" work began at 9:15 AM and was completed at 12:15 PM. When Shanghai Mayor Yu Hongjun entrusted these files to the Shanghai Municipal Council, they were transported by nineteen trucks, which took three nights, namely November 29 and 30 and December 1, 1937. Today, during the "transfer" of these files, more than a hundred police officers, led by Mr. Smith, guarded the Shanghai Municipal Council building, while Russian and Indian police officers were responsible for protecting the trucks. Only Sato from the special affairs team participated from the Japanese side. Journalists who went to take pictures were prohibited, but those who sneaked into higher parts of the Shanghai Municipal Council building were still able to take some shots.</p>
<p>Checking and Sending on Trucks</p>
<p>That morning, there were only more than a hundred police officers in the Shanghai Municipal Council building. In addition, there were 312 boxes of Land Bureau files piled on both sides. At 9:17 AM, Mr. Duncan, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Council's Public Utilities Department, opened the locks on the 312 iron cages. After both parties inspected the seals and stamps on the wooden boxes, they were continuously moved out of the security room and onto the trucks scheduled outside, beginning their fate of falling into enemy hands. When the transport began, police officers, Russian police, and Indian police all stood guard around the area.</p>
<p>Strict Protection, Driving Away One After Another</p>
<p>At 10:15 AM, all the wooden boxes were loaded, and then the reserve team's red cross police cars escorted them away from the Shanghai Municipal Council building. At the same time, a team of armed Indian police and several Japanese military police guarded the trucks. The convoy drove north along the Bund, across the Garden Bridge to the Huangpu Road intersection, where they were replaced by pseudo-"Municipal Government Police," and the Japanese consulate authorities re-examined them. Then, each truck continued to proceed to the city center. Thus, all the Land Bureau files fell into the hands of the puppet regime.</p>
<p>Future Disputes Just Beginning</p>
<p>These files include all land deeds inside and outside the current jurisdiction. Just after 9:15 AM yesterday morning, these files were transported out of the Shanghai Municipal Council, and the transportation was completed at 12:15 PM in the afternoon. The property rights of all Chinese and foreign people will be greatly affected by this move by the Shanghai Municipal Council, especially the Chinese property owners, because Chinese property owners will be forced to be controlled by the puppet regime. According to rumors from outside, after the pseudo "Municipal Government" gets these files, because most property owners support the Chongqing Central Government, it may take retaliatory measures to threaten them and "confiscate" their properties when necessary. However, some Chinese property owners have reportedly transferred their property rights to foreigners, but this change of history has not been registered in the files. From this, it can be seen that complex and chaotic disputes are just beginning.</p>
<p>American Consul Did Not Agree</p>
<p>The Shanghai Land Bureau files, which Mayor Yu Hongjun deposited with the Shanghai Municipal Council through formal procedures, were transferred by the Shanghai Municipal Council to Japanese Consul General Miura yesterday. The Japanese puppet regime began demanding the transfer of these files in May of last year. The Shanghai Municipal Council has always believed that this is property entrusted by the Chinese government and could not be handed over to a third party, which was greatly appreciated by people at home and abroad. However, it suddenly abandoned its original position and handed it over, which has already been implemented. People want to know how it happened. According to the Japanese "Continental News," this was the result of the mediation of the Italian Consul General. The newspaper said that after the "Municipal Government" made a strong demand to the consular corps for the transfer of the Land Bureau files, Shanghai Municipal Council Director Gangben Ichisaku ran around lobbying the Western directors. The Italian Consul General also asked the consular corps to discuss how to respond to the handover. Although the American Consul General was unwilling to agree to the handover, the Italian Consul General mediated between the Shanghai Municipal Council and the Japanese side, and the method of transferring the files to Consul General Miura for receipt was adopted.</p>

<p>The Ningbo Shaoxing Disaster Relief Committee of the Shaoshao Public Relief Committee is scheduled to hold the second fundraising conference at 4:00 PM on the afternoon of the 14th of this month at the Shaoxing Shanghai Fellow Villagers Association Hall, No. 330 Avenue Edward VII, Public Concession. At that time, they will actively discuss raising 3 million yuan in donations for grain price stabilization as soon as possible to relieve the urgent needs of their fellow villagers. According to the person in charge of the association, since the first fundraising conference, they have received a total of more than 200,000 yuan in donations as of yesterday, and 120,000 yuan has been withdrawn to purchase 1,000 bags of foreign rice and transport them to Shaoxing for assistance. Also, the rumor that Jiangxi rice can be transported to Shaoxing for assistance is not true, because in these extraordinary times, each province must be self-sufficient in grain. Therefore, the rice shortage in Shaoxing is still very serious. The Ningbo grain price stabilization donation fundraising conference is also scheduled to be held for the third time this afternoon at 4:00 PM at the Ningbo Shanghai Fellow Villagers Association Hall on Rue Yu Ya Ching. The Polish Disaster Relief Committee's drama performance at the Lyceum Theatre on March 27th raised donations, and after expenses, there was a net surplus of 8,978 yuan and 29 cents.</p>

According to what the reporter has learned, of the 88 shelters in the area, only 6 have been ordered to relocate, and the others can still live there peacefully. However, since the area office was withdrawn and the cleaning work in the area was stopped, dirt has accumulated, and at the same time, it is the hot summer season, and the number of refugee diseases is gradually increasing. Now, Xin Puyu Hall and the First Hospital in the area are planning to expand their medical treatment and medicine distribution, and they still hope that charitable people will provide assistance.</p>

<p>Reuters from Tokyo on the 4th reported that the three Japanese ministries of the Army, Navy, and Foreign Affairs all said they had no formal comment on Hong Kong's evacuation of women and children, but reiterated that they did not understand the reason for it. All they knew about the evacuation was from reading the newspapers. An army spokesman considered the evacuation a bizarre action, saying that the Japanese army had not occupied Hong Kong.</p>
<p>British Territory</p>
<p>While committed to revising wartime supplies to Chongqing, they had no intention of crossing the border at this time. One view is that there is no reason for panic in Hong Kong. Some quarters regard the evacuation of women and children as an unfriendly gesture, intended to incite the United States to take definite action in the Far East. The British government's request to the Japanese side to stop wartime supplies being transported to Chongqing via Hong Kong and Burma.</p>
<p>Slow to Reply</p>
<p>This has caused considerable dissatisfaction in various quarters here. This is further evidence of Britain's attempt to draw the United States into Anglo-Japanese incidents. Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman Sama said that he believed Britain had no reason to consult with the United States. According to general opinion, Japanese people who do not want Anglo-Japanese relations to continue to deteriorate hope that Britain will comply with Japan's demands, and say that Britain</p>
<p>Pro-Chongqing Policy</p>
<p>Will strengthen Japan's pro-German sentiments. Well-informed sources expect a surprising reaction in the Far East if the British government rejects Japan's demands. Japan is currently patiently awaiting the British reply. The Japanese Embassy in Tokyo, because it could not foresee what the British would answer, refused to make any critical remarks.</p>

<p>The Hygiene Department of the French Municipal Council and the Vehicle Department of the French Concession Police, in view of the arrival of summer and the fact that rickshaws are one of the mediums for transmitting infectious diseases, have been conducting rickshaw disinfection in the French Concession at 350 Avenue Haig since the 25th of last month. According to an interview by a reporter from the Pingming News Agency, there are a total of 5,400 rickshaws in the French Concession, of which 2,500 have been disinfected as of yesterday. The disinfection takes place once every three weeks, with 220 rickshaws disinfected each time. Each rickshaw puller sends their rickshaw for disinfection at 11:00 PM and picks it up at 5:00 AM the next morning. Yesterday at 7:00 PM, to accommodate visits from various sectors, the disinfection was conducted earlier. Those who attended yesterday included French Consul-General Eugène, the Director-General of the French Municipal Council, the Head of the Political Affairs Department of the French Concession Police, Walter, and more than a dozen others. A demonstration was given to the public. All the vehicles to be disinfected were stored in an airtight chamber, which contained sulfur and other disinfectant chemicals. The disinfection time was five hours. According to the person in charge, after the vehicles are disinfected, the authorities issue a disinfection certificate, which is required for passage within the concession. Furthermore, rickshaw pullers receive free preventative injections, free bathing, and free cleaning of clothes every morning.</p>

<h3 id="e88">Establishment of the Rice Price Evaluation Committee; Rice Prices to Be Evaluated Starting Yesterday; Evaluations to Be Conducted Twice Weekly, Every Other Day; Over 80,000 Bags of Foreign Rice Have Arrived This Week <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>Although the situation in Hong Kong and Vietnam has been tense recently, the arrival of foreign rice in Shanghai continues unabated. One day, the Zeni Kana Maru mail ship of the Java Company arrived from Hong Kong with more than 16,000 bags; on the 2nd, the Taesheng Wheel of Jardine Matheson arrived from Haiphong with 650 bags and from Hong Kong with 17,051 bags; on the 3rd, the Yongsheng Wheel of Jardine Matheson transported 11,502 bags from Hong Kong. Yesterday (the 5th), the Suiyang Wheel of Butterfield &amp; Swire transported 19,239 bags from Hong Kong, and the Taiyuan Wheel transported 20,430 bags from Hong Kong and is currently unloading.</p>
<p>Rice Arrivals Excessive, Yet Prices Rise</p>
<p>The above-mentioned information has been repeatedly recorded in the commercial news column of this newspaper. Up to yesterday this week, a total of 84,872 bags of foreign rice have arrived, which, according to daily usage calculations, must have a surplus. However, the rice prices in the city are rising step by step, which clearly indicates the malpractice of speculation and price gouging.</p>
<p>Establishment of the Evaluation Committee</p>
<p>The Shanghai Rice Price Evaluation Committee held its inaugural meeting at 3:00 PM yesterday at the Doumi Industry Association Hall at 15 Avenue Edward VII. Zhang Yingmei from the Public Works Department of the International Settlement, Xie Xuefang from the French Municipal Council, Zhao Zhiyou from the French Concession Evaluation Committee, Zhong Jinchen from the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, and all members of the committee were present. Chen Ziyi was publicly elected as the temporary chairman. First, the chairman reported on the purpose of the meeting, followed by a congratulatory speech from Zhao Zhiyou, the representative of the French Concession Evaluation Committee (speech omitted). Then, discussions began on: (1) amending and passing the organizational regulations; (2) resolving to publicly elect Zhang Nianxuan, Chen Ziyi, Zhu Zixiang, Fu Qiangeng, Chen Shide, He Quansheng, and Zhu Youzhang as seven standing committee members; (3) resolving that from the 6th to the 9th of this month, the prices of various foreign rice varieties will temporarily be based on the highest prices announced by the Doumi Industry Association on the 2nd of this month, and the market prices after the 10th will be publicly announced after evaluation on the 9th; (4) in addition to sending letters to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to advise various industry groups to order foreign rice, the rice industry will also collectively order 50,000 to 100,000 bags of foreign rice to increase the amount of stored rice. If ships are lacking, the authorities of the two concessions will be requested to assist; (5) Zhao Zhiyou proposed that financial circles be requested to undertake foreign rice mortgage loans to increase the amount of stored rice. The resolution was unanimously approved, and the committee will send letters to the authorities of the two concessions and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to forward the request to financial circles for assistance. The following is a general record of the Shanghai Rice Price Evaluation Committee.</p>
<p>The regulations are as follows: (1) This committee is organized by various rice industry groups in accordance with the intentions of the Shanghai Concession authorities, and the authorities of the two concessions and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce are invited to participate and provide guidance. It is named the Shanghai Rice Price Evaluation Committee. (2) This committee consists of twenty-one members recommended by the following groups: Doumi Industry Association (3), Miscellaneous Grains and Oilseed Industry Association (3), Guangbang Shenshoutang (2), Hanbang Zhichengtang (1), Zhenjiangbang Jiyutang (1), Chaozhou Sugar and Sundries Industry Association (1), Rice Market Management Committee (3), Rice Shop Industry Association (2), Nanbang Guildhall (1), Changshu Guildhall (1), Rice Milling Industry Association (1), Rice Grain Dealers Association (1), and Shanghai Northern Rice Merchants Lianyihui (1). (3) The mission of this committee is: actively, to find ways to balance rice prices, stabilize the rice market, smooth the source of supply, and increase the amount of stored rice; passively, to prevent speculation by outsiders, hoarding by dealers, repeated buying and selling, and price gouging to make profits, in order to assist the concession authorities in jointly maintaining people's food supply. (4) This committee refers to the storage, arrival, sales, production cost, and other conditions of rice grains to evaluate the highest market price of various types of rice.</p>
<p>Twice Every Week</p>
<p>The evaluation will be held twice a week, on Tuesdays and Fridays, and implemented on Wednesdays and Saturdays, but for the time being, only foreign rice will be evaluated. (5) The rice prices evaluated by this committee should be reported to the authorities of the two concessions at any time and submitted to the Rice Market Committee for public announcement. Once rice prices are evaluated and announced, they must be strictly followed. Market transactions are only allowed to be below the evaluated prices and must not exceed the limit. If there are any black market activities, once discovered, they should be reported to the authorities of the two concessions for severe punishment. (6) The address of this committee is temporarily located at the Doumi Industry Association Hall at 15 Avenue Edward VII.</p>
<p>Tribute Rice Price Lower Than Shanghai by Six Yuan</p>
<p>The Shanghai People's Food Adjustment Association orders foreign rice to adjust people's food supply, and has always entrusted British firms such as He Yi to purchase on its behalf. However, in order to save commissions, the association has agreed with Saigon that it can directly order rice from Saigon by telegram. According to Mr. Miao Huanxiang of the association, the price of foreign rice purchased by the association is about six yuan lower per bag than that sold on the market. Therefore, various factories in Shanghai have been actively entrusting the association to order foreign rice.</p>

<p>Chai Xiyan, a 31-year-old native of Yuyao who lives on the third floor of No. 12, Lane 263, Yangshupu Road, works as a cook. Because he resented his fellow townsman Zhou Jiayin, who lived in the pavilion room of the same building, for committing adultery with his concubine Wu Gu-shi, he bought a cleaver at around 5:00 PM on the 24th of last month. Upon returning home, without asking questions, he hacked Zhou Jiayin to death with random blows. Wu Gu-shi screamed for help, and her right wrist was also slashed. Neighbors broke down the door and handed Chai over to the police, who sent him to the First Special Court, where he was prosecuted under Article 271 of the Criminal Law for premeditated murder. Judge Jiang interrogated him and remanded him in custody for a later hearing. The hearing continued yesterday morning. The defendant admitted that because the deceased committed adultery with his mistress Wu Gu-shi, he was unwilling to accept it, so he bought a knife and committed the crime. The court ordered lawyer Zhang Tianyin of the police and the appointed defense lawyer to debate with each other, and then announced the end of the trial. The court sentenced Chai Xiyan to life imprisonment, deprived him of his civil rights for life, and confiscated the murder weapon.</p>

<p>Wu Gu-shi, a 35-year-old widow living at No. 43, Baokang Lane, Avenue Joffre, has been widowed for several years. She has an elderly aunt above her and four children below her, all of whom are supported by her needlework. Recently, due to economic pressure, the life of the family, both old and young, has been difficult to maintain, leading to a short-sighted decision. On the afternoon of the 3rd, she abandoned her elderly aunt and young children and took sleeping pills to commit suicide. At 5:30 PM in the evening, she was discovered by her family and sent to Guangren Hospital on Avenue Amiral Courbet. However, due to the depth of the poisoning, the treatment was ineffective, and she died yesterday morning. Her aunt, Wu Song-shi, signed for the body to be collected for burial.</p>
<p>Suicide by Slitting the Throat</p>
<p>At 5:40 AM yesterday morning, Dong Jiyao (31 years old), a traveler at No. 221, Andong Hostel, Hubei Road, in the International Settlement, suddenly committed suicide in his room by stabbing his throat with a sharp knife. The tea boy discovered this and reported it to the police, who sent him to Renji Hospital for treatment. Also yesterday morning, a resident surnamed Jia at No. 3, Qingxiang Lane, Route Conty, in the French Concession, also attempted suicide by slitting his throat with a sharp knife. Because his throat was severed, he died immediately. The body was sent to the coroner's office for examination.</p>
<p>Quarrel Leads to Suicide Attempt</p>
<p>At 11:50 AM yesterday morning, Xu Zhang-shi, a 22-year-old local woman from No. 36, Huaxinfang, Yangshupu Road, suddenly swallowed a gold ring to commit suicide. After being discovered by her family, she was taken to Hudong Hospital for treatment. It is reported that the reason for her suicide was a family quarrel.</p>

<p>Liu Yugui, a judge of the Criminal Division of the Shanghai First Special District Local Court, recently received a threatening letter indicating that Liu should handle the kidnapping cases he is currently trying with caution. The kidnapping cases mentioned mainly refer to the case of Mo Mou and others, military personnel, being sued for kidnapping. Yesterday morning was the date of the trial. For the sake of proper protection, the police and the court authorities, in addition to the detectives and bailiffs strictly guarding the entrance of the court and searching everyone entering the court, also had detectives and bailiffs stationed at the entrance and behind the Criminal Court No. 2 where Judge Liu was presiding, to prevent accidents.</p>

<p>Trolley bus No. 384 on Route 16, operated by the Public Bus Company of the International Settlement and running from Caojiadu to Sanyangjing Bridge in West Shanghai, was driven by driver No. 137. At 7:50 PM last night, as it departed from Caojiadu and stopped at the intersection of Mackinnon Road and Changping Road, a thug suddenly threw a hand grenade into the third-class carriage window for unknown reasons. Because the throw was very forceful, the hand grenade exploded in the car, with a loud bang that resounded far and wide. Thick smoke filled the air, and shrapnel flew everywhere. Passengers in the car were unable to avoid it, and five passengers and ticket seller No. 175 were injured by the shrapnel. The body of the bus and the glass windows were also severely damaged. The uninjured passengers got off the bus and fled for their lives. Later, the Chinese police arrived after hearing the sound, but the thug who threw the grenade had already escaped without a trace. An ambulance was quickly summoned to send the six injured to Baolong Hospital and the Red Cross Hospital for treatment. It is heard that two pedestrians on the side of the road were also injured by the shrapnel, but the injuries were very minor and they hired a car to go to the hospital for treatment. The names of the injured are Gu Jinxiang, 17 years old, from Shaoxing; Qian Xifeng, 23 years old, from Shaoxing, a female worker at the Xin Xin No. 9 Factory, residing in the factory; Wu Zhang-shi, 30 years old, from Suzhou, and her daughter Wu Jinqian, 13 years old, residing at No. 9, Chedaijiao, Caojiadu; Dong Shen-shi, 51 years old, from Jiangbei, a female worker at the Yong'an Yarn Factory; and ticket seller Yao Gechang, 32 years old, residing at No. 6, Lane 813, Gongyi Factory, Caojiadu. All were injured in the head, face, legs, and arms. It is heard that Qian Xifeng was seriously injured.</p>
<h3 id="e94">Arrested for Using Counterfeit Money; The Offender Had Been Sentenced to Imprisonment and Released on Parole; After Investigation, the Order Was Issued to Reschedule for Further Verification <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>Lin Huixin from Anhui Province, 32 years old, came to Shanghai from Nanjing one week ago and lodged with a friend at No. 128, Avenue du Roi Albert. Because he was unemployed and poor, he purchased 165 counterfeit banknotes of the Central Bank, all five-yuan notes, totaling 825 yuan, from Ye Huadong for 60 yuan.</p>
<p>Using These Counterfeit Banknotes</p>
<p>On the afternoon of the 2nd of this month, at 5:00 PM, he went to the Feishun Leather Shoe Store opened by Shen Jinsong, a local, at No. 217, Avenue du Roi Albert, to buy two pairs of yellow and white leather shoes, priced at 50 yuan. He first paid Shen with real money, then falsely claimed that he needed to go elsewhere to shop, and asked Sun to return the real money, intending to pay a ten-yuan deposit so that he could pay the shoe price and pick up the goods after returning from shopping. Shen did not allow his request. Lin still took out the same counterfeit banknote from his bag and paid Shen, and took the shoes.</p>
<p>Calmly Left</p>
<p>Shen did not suspect anything at the time because he had already counted the money. It was not until he checked the money in the evening that he realized it was counterfeit. He immediately notified his younger brother, Shen Jinlin, who opened the Jiabu Leather Shoe Store at No. 66, Avenue Joffre, to pay attention. Unexpectedly, Lin was caught in the net of justice. On the afternoon of the 4th, at 2:00 PM, he went to the Jiabu Leather Shoe Store to use the same trick and was discovered by Shen Jinlin, who reported it to Detective No. 196, who arrested Lin and confiscated ten counterfeit and real banknotes each, and</p>
<p>Searched Out Counterfeit Banknotes</p>
<p>155 banknotes, and brought them to the police station together and sent them to the Criminal Court No. 1 of the Second Special Court. Police lawyer Fei Xizhen requested an extension on the grounds that the police department had not completed the investigation. When questioned, the defendant confessed that he had been working in the military and had come to Shanghai from Nanjing one week ago. Because he was unfamiliar with the place and had difficulty making a living, he resorted to this trick. He also admitted that he had been sentenced to seven years of imprisonment by the court in 1932 and had been released on parole during the war in 1937, but he had already</p>
<p>Served Six Years in Prison</p>
<p>Judge Sun Penghao ordered a rescheduling for further interrogation on the 15th because the police had not yet filed charges. The ten five-yuan real banknotes that were confiscated were returned to the plaintiff Shen Jinsong as compensation for the shoe price. Shen signed for them in court. The 155 counterfeit banknotes that were confiscated were ordered to be stored in the treasury for confiscation.</p>

<h3 id="e98">Poem on a Chaste Woman <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>The chaste woman, surnamed Liu, is from Dagang, Binhu. Her given name is Jiayin. She was betrothed to Zhu Zongfu, a student, but Zhu's family was poor, and he died of illness before they could marry. When the chaste woman heard the news, she vowed to go to his house and remain chaste. She wore plain clothes and went there weeping, and hundreds of people in the village watched, all shedding tears for her. I write this poem to commemorate her!</p>
<p>(1) Meng Guang's talent and virtue surpassed the ordinary; she was willing to marry Liang Hong and did not despise poverty; unfortunately, "Peach Blossoms" had not yet been recited, and the song of parting left new tear stains. (2) It was reported that her good man was ill and resting; she burned incense and prayed to the heavens first; who knew that the allotted time was difficult to reverse, and cutting flesh to prepare medicine soup was in vain. (3) Hearing the news, she hurriedly drove the boat here, removing her bracelets and earrings and tailoring a ramie skirt; Gong Jiang had long ago set her will on the cypress boat, and there was no need for others to persuade her a hundred times. (4) Before marrying, she wanted to go, following her husband and not betraying her pure heart; after entering the door and paying respects to her parents-in-law, she knelt before the spirit tablet, shedding tears. (5) Thinking of sacrificing her body for her husband, all she heard was weeping all day long; not just once did she try to drown or hang herself, and she stopped eating for days, causing more sorrow. (6) Her husband's family had always had a literary fragrance, and they frequently discussed continuing the lineage; there were few uncles and brothers, and the family was pitifully desolate. (7) She was unwilling to rely on her mother's family, and was willing to guard a poor family and keep her jade pure; she had no regrets about eating coarse tea and drinking medicine, and her fierce nature and firm integrity were commendable. (8) An old aunt still exists with white hair, and she tries her best to serve her and make her happy; her great integrity and great chastity will never be extinguished, and it is especially appropriate that she be honored with a memorial archway in the future.</p>

<h3 id="e100">Vitamin K <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>— Mo Ming</p>
<p>Several older brothers among vitamins: A, B, C... everyone is already very familiar with them. Now I am going to introduce one of their younger brothers—K.</p>
<p>Although this younger brother is still very young, he is "developing" unusually quickly. Since 1925, when Dr. Henrik Dam of Denmark first discovered this substance in food that can prevent bleeding disorders in animals, scientists around the world have been working on it, and new discoveries have emerged one after another. Until last year, his chemical structural formula and artificial synthesis methods were successively successfully researched, and this year even artificial products have appeared on the market. In just five years, almost all problems have been solved, which can truly be said to be a representative work of modern science's high-speed progress.</p>
<p>Vitamin K is named "antihemorrhagic vitamin": animals will suffer from a bleeding disorder if they lack it in their bodies. Bleeding is something that everyone has experienced. Usually, the blood will naturally clot to seal the wound, but when suffering from a bleeding disorder, the blood loses its original clotting ability, resulting in continuous bleeding and a serious situation. Originally, the blood clotting effect is not a simple phenomenon. When our body sends out an emergency bleeding signal, many "firefighters" that are normally present in the blood immediately mobilize to rush to the scene of the accident to carry out rescue work. According to physiologists, the personnel participating in the rescue at the time include: "fibrinogen," "thrombin," "prothrombin," "thrombokinase," and "platelets"; their action procedure is as follows: platelets rupture themselves, releasing large quantities of thrombokinase, which combine with prothrombin to generate thrombin, and thrombin then combines with fibrinogen to form fibrin protein. These many fibers can be linked together to form a tight network that fills the bleeding gap, and then the great task of clotting is declared complete. As for vitamin K, it is also an important participant in this campaign. Its task has not been fully clarified yet, but if it is not present, prothrombin cannot be produced, rescue work cannot proceed, and the blood will never be able to clot. The physiological function of the human body is so magical that it is truly amazing; if we compare the human body to a precise and complex machine, then vitamin K is a very small gear in it. Although the thing is insignificant, its relationship to the entire organization is not insignificant.</p>
<p>Foods containing vitamin K include alfalfa, spinach, tomatoes, milk, etc.: also, because it is a fat-soluble substance, various vegetable oils also contain a little bit. I would like to introduce alfalfa (also known as grass seeds, similar to golden flower vegetables, but with purple flowers). This is a plant rich in various vitamins and other nutrients, with low prices and good quality. It is worth promoting. Those who pay attention to food and nutrition should not miss it.</p>

<p>— Xu Yi</p>
<p>Days roll by, and in the blink of an eye, it's another scorching summer.</p>
<p>Facing the noisy street, unable to catch a breath, I followed the leisurely crowd into the park on a whim.</p>
<p>In the park, the flowers, not yet withered with the passing of spring, hung their heads. People squatting in the flowerbeds happily accepted their greetings and smiled with joy.</p>
<p>Thus, laughter filled the entire park, and the leaves of all the trees hummed a soft tune. In the tune, in the laughter, lay the aspirations of the joyful people, entrusting a philosophy of life that treats the world as a mere inn.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the laughter disappeared, vanishing between the flowers and leaves, fading from the ears of the traveler—my heart felt heavy.</p>
<p>A child harboring homesickness is sorrowful. Facing the flowers, the flowers bled crimson; facing the leaves, the leaves sobbed faintly; facing the people, the laughter of the people held ten thousand shames; facing the sky, the sky turned grim, scolding the unpromising child who had lost his home.</p>
<p>Clutching my own heart, I felt even more breathless than in the bustling city; powerlessly gazing around, the people around me laughed, how vigorously they laughed!</p>
<p>"The park is not fit for lonely young people to enjoy; only the wilderness belongs to the children of the earth! The park is merely an adornment for the city dwellers."</p>
<p>I sighed and stepped out of the park gate, gasping for air.</p>

<h3 id="e102">Growth of a Great Era <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>— Jingwei</p>
<p>We are facing a great era head-on. It is this era that inspires us, encourages us to strive, and plants new life within our resolute confidence! However, this era has its past, its growth, and has undergone much hardship and peril, especially in the transition from chaos to unity, from centrifugal to centripetal forces. Here, we must not forget the ideological shift of the youth, which propelled the growth of this great era.</p>
<p>Mr. Qi Tong's "New Generation" trilogy aims to reflect this chain reaction. It is not merely a novel but a living history book. Although we can currently only see the first part, "December 9th," it already depicts the ideological path of the youth in North China, unfolding a heroic and resolute scene! As the author says in the introduction: "But its content is vast, ever-changing, and profound."</p>
<p>In this "December 9th," the author focuses on writing about people, about the ideological transformation of the youth. Each of them has shortcomings and advantages; some advance, some lag behind, and some even betray the cause. However, behind the activities of these young people, the inherent progress of humanity is revealed. There are cruel conspiracies hatched by political corruption and the claws of evil forces operating in the shadows. But from "December 9th" to "December 16th" and the winter vacation work in the countryside, from planning to demonstrations and sabotage to deeper involvement with the people, the growth of new characters is portrayed throughout. How they gradually transformed from bookworms and onlookers into revolutionaries, how they shed the habits of privileged youth and embarked on the arduous and challenging path of struggle!</p>
<p>Of course, it's not all a heroic scene here. The author uses a critical pen to depict the superficiality and disorganization of mass struggles, which serves as a powerful lesson. Thus, there is rebirth and sacrifice, resolution and wavering. Yet "December 9th" is like a bomb that awakens the youth and people of the entire nation. Although this struggle was not enough to prevent the shameful weakness of diplomacy, it has awakened the sleeping lion! As the female protagonist Wei Ling says: "But it doesn't matter; this is a seed! Don't forget, it can produce many new ones. Look, the spring breeze has already stirred!..."</p>
<p>From this, although there is still room for improvement and refinement in the writing techniques of the "New Generation," it is a novel worth reading and should be read, especially by the youth trapped in the isolated island who feel frustrated. They should draw excitement and clarity from this (especially from the few illustrations), because here you see your own shadow, the shadow of the entire new generation! (New Generation, written by Qi Tong, published by Life Bookstore)</p>

<p>— Translated by Jingzheng</p>
<p>Those who chase money are "money grubbers"; those who hoard money are capitalists; those who waste money are playboys; those who can't get money are useless people; those who don't want to get money lack ambition; those who get money without working are parasites. If he spends his whole life working to accumulate money, people will say he is a fool without any meaning in life. Vic Oliver</p>

<p>Chapter 3: Conflicting Information</p>
<p>At this moment, a burst of noise suddenly arose outside the door—the sound of a car, voices, and leather shoes—abruptly interrupting Jinmei's speech. Hawthorne and Ni Jinshou also stood up from the cushioned chairs. I felt that the air in the room had suddenly become tense.</p>
<p>A minute later, the source of the noise outside the door was clarified. It turned out that the police hearse from the police station had arrived. Ni Jinshou pocketed his notebook and rushed ahead of Hawthorne to make contact. Before long, a uniformed police officer, leading four white-clad porters carrying a narrow stretcher, followed Ni Jinshou into the reception room. This police officer was called Qin Mozhai, who had a comical face suitable for the camera, and we were already acquainted with him.</p>
<p>He greeted us with a smile and said, "Mr. Hawthorne, have you found any clues yet?"</p>
<p>Hawthorne shook his head slightly. "It's still early."</p>
<p>"I believe that once you cast your discerning eye upon it, any secret will be revealed. I'm not flattering you, the murderer will definitely not escape." Qin Mozhai grinned at Hawthorne.</p>
<p>Hawthorne replied awkwardly, "Chief Qin, don't joke around. You make a living from the law; your eyes are the discerning ones. I can't be sure whether the murderer will escape or not. This matter is too complicated."</p>
<p>"Don't be modest; you'll always find a way."</p>
<p>"Really, my work must begin after your work is completed."</p>
<p>"What does that mean?"</p>
<p>Hawthorne stopped answering and took out his cigarette case from his pocket again.</p>
<p>Ni Jinshou said, "Chief Qin, don't get angry. Hurry up and take the body out. We still have to ask questions." He cast a glance at Jinmei, who was standing in front of the dressing table mirror.</p>
<h3 id="e105">City <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>— Lei Xing</p>
<p>I stand before the window of a high-rise, overlooking this urban landscape. The scene of the city resembles the clumsy strokes of an unskilled painter: so chaotic. But my imagination lingers on the past.</p>
<p>At that time, this place was just a fishing village with a few families, desolate and deserted; a cry sent into the distance would be suspected as the embodiment of terror.</p>
<p>Afterwards, it grew up under blood and tears and the "civilized" cannons of humiliation.</p>
<p>The noise of the streets interrupts the path of my imagination. Returning to reality, I must ask: City, where are you going next? With the smoke of war covering the sky and the world in turmoil, how many good days do you have left? In this era, in these times, who can maintain that fortune forever?</p>
<p>Now is the age of reckoning. City, how many sins have you conceived? You are digging your own grave with your own hands.</p>
<p>Moreover, the cannons will eventually return.</p>

<h3 id="e106">About Edward G. Robinson <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>— Qinghui</p>
<p>Edward G. Robinson, who recently played the lead role in "Dr. Ehrlich's Magic Bullet," used to have his roles always confined to the realm of violent personalities; but this time, he broke out of that mold and played a kind-hearted, compassionate doctor, and he was still appropriate and convincing in every way. Indeed, Robinson is a talented actor.</p>
<p>The Miracle of Success: When Robinson was studying at school, whenever he had free time, he would always carry an old wooden box, stand among the crowds on the street, and give speeches. He later told others that these speeches greatly helped him in his acting on the screen later, because he often gave speeches, he became experienced, and when he acted, he felt at ease.</p>
<p>Loves Children: Robinson's sense of life is mostly concentrated in his family, art, books, friends, and his beloved son, Manny. He often mentioned Manny in conversation, and the first thing he did when he got home from work was to caress his son, and sometimes recite a few poems to him. A group of friends were always happy and interesting in his home, and would often propose a topic for mutual debate. He also liked to go to plays or concerts and lectures, and often hosted banquets.</p>
<p>Strong Personality: Once, he taught Manny, "A person in society must respect others. Most importantly, one should know that everyone has his own dignity. If one has done something wrong, one naturally deserves it; but if it is not due to one's own fault, but due to the interference of others, then, for the sake of justice, one must stand up and fight to maintain one's own dignity." From this passage, Robinson's personality can be imagined, and it seems that he also wants to pass this strong personality on to his son!</p>
<p>Pipe King: Robinson is Hollywood's famous "Pipe King." He has a special fondness for pipes. He feels that each type of pipe can represent a person's personality. For example: those who are irritable or those who are thoughtful. By looking at his pipe, one can imagine it. He once collected one hundred and nine types of pipes, each with a different form, not only elegant and beautiful, but also antique. When filming, he likes to use a small pipe, because he can put it in his pocket at will during breaks.</p>
<p>"The Man They Could Not Hang" is the most terrifying blockbuster of the season, co-starring Karloff and Lorre. The whole film is full of thrills and horror and is indeed the only sweat reliever for the summer. Now showing at the Nanjing Grand Theatre.</p>
<h3 id="e107">Tan Fuying's First Night on Stage <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>— Wei Wo</p>
<p>The day after Ma Lianliang stopped performing, Tan Fuying, who is as famous as Ma and one of the three great beards of the Beijing Chao school, took the stage at the Updating Stage. The reporter went to watch on time and recorded it as follows:</p>
<p>"When I arrived at the theater, the stage was performing 'A Happy Marriage.' Ji Yanfen (that is, Xiao Guihua) is old and faded, and her makeup is not good. Playing a Hua Dan play, she seems to have lost her class, but when she appears, someone applauds. On this day, Yanfen was on stilts, and her stilt skills are still not weak, but there is nothing else worth mentioning. Jiang Miaoxiang's Lu Kunjie only performed one scene of 'Teaching', which lasted only ten minutes. Then Yang Shengchun's 'Picking the Chariot,' with Han Shengxin playing Yuan Shu. Tan Shiying was not seen on stage. Yang Shengchun had not been seen for three years and has made a lot of progress. The play 'Picking the Chariot' was originally Shengchun's masterpiece, and this evening was the first performance, so he put in a lot of effort. Therefore, this play was like wildfire, and his fight with Zhang Lianting below the stage showed even more skill. Unfortunately, his voice is still weak, so the long 'Pomegranate Flower' song is difficult to satisfy people's expectations. This is the only regret; if Shengchun has a day when his voice is clear, then it will not be difficult to grasp the leadership of the Wusheng of today." The final act was Chen Lifang's "Female Escort." Lifang is one who strives to learn Yanqiu, and people say that Lifang can only learn Cheng's shortness and cannot take Cheng's length. But watching her perform the Escort, she has things worth praising. That is, her singing and recitation and enunciation are as attentive to yin and yang and level tones as Yanqiu's, such as the word "deliver" in the flowing water "Deliver the letter to my third brother," such as the word "spring" in "I do not know the spring in prison," are all good; only Yanqiu's singing, the bass shows quite a bit of effort, and every time it pleases in the bass, Lifang's bass is not enough, which is her shortcoming.</p>
<p>The supporting role of Chong Gongdao, Xiao Shoushan, is stable and flawless, which is rare. The finale was Tan Fuying's entire "Empty City Strategy." The four introductory lines when he appeared on stage, the last sentence was quite forceful, but he still felt timid, and seemed unable to give full play to it; in the original allegro, the first sentence, "The two countries are at odds, dragons and tigers fight," was full of meaning and got a full applause. The tune used in the fourth sentence, "Wu wants freedom," is the same as that sung by Shuyan. Later in the allegro, the sentence "Han Zhuge supports the young lord," the tune of the three words "supports the young lord" is also the same as that sung by Shuyan. Looking at Fuying's play as a whole, there are many places in the singing where he learns from Shuyan. I have never seen Tan Xinpei, but judging by his intentions, Fuying's play must be secretly learning from Shuyan. Losing the Street Pavilion, the scene of looking at the map is excellent; reciting the second "captured" in "captured", the sound is turned high, and it sounds quite pleasant, followed by singing the allegro "Little Ma Su lost the Street Pavilion, which is hateful," the third sentence "Old soldiers, why are you discussing," the four words "discussing" should have a good tune, Fuying failed to use it well. The last two sentences "Tell the old soldiers to sweep the streets and hold on to the peace of mind," "Rely on this Qin to protect the empty city," Fuying suddenly came on, "hold on to the peace of mind," made a long tune, and turned it high to sing, getting a full applause. The ending of the four words "rely on this Qin" is also quite wonderful. The city tower scene is the lifeblood of the entire play. On this evening, Fuying only sang six and a half tunes, and his voice was not very pleasant. The first sentence of the slow allegro "I am originally," although it got applause, seemed not as good as the second sentence. In the next section, the second and sixth allegro "I am watching the mountain scenery on the city tower," because I had something to do, I didn't have time to listen to the difference, so I left my seat and went elsewhere, so I didn't get to see the final scene of beheading Su. As for the supporting roles, Wang Quankui's Sima Yi was still competent, and Ha Bao Shan's Wang Ping was excellent. Bao Shan has a stage posture, which is wonderful. Ye Shengmao's Ma Su has shallow skill and is not as thoughtful as Quankui. But he has made a lot of progress compared to his last visit to Shanghai. Ci Ruiquan is old and strong, but in this play, he plays the old soldier reporting the news and failed to show his strengths.</p>
