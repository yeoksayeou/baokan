<h3 id="c11">上海公共租界改選董事與租界前途 <a href="#c11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>上海公共租界究竟將變成日本租界嗎？假定變了、連帶引起的劇變怎多？連帶影響的利害怎大？難道這是無意識的問題，這是無意識的假定？難道這是絕不可能而不必想像的現象？以我們觀感，不應斥此為不必想像、却應認識其不堪設想。近數日，且已有人發覺了這問題而驚訝疑懼了。</p>
<p>問題什近數日，由於租界工部局董事任期屆滿，本月十七日改選、距今祗剩兩週。歷來成例，董事人數計中國五人，英國五人，美國日本各兩人；除華董由納稅華人會選舉外，英美日三國籍董事由西人納稅會產生；在西人納稅會正式集會票選之前，由各國旅滬僑民團體先行分別產生相當數目的候選人。這一次，日本人方面却突然破例推出候選人有五名之多。按平面觀察，日僑擁有票權幾乎居國別的最多數，倘若背棄了五五二二此例的君子協定，亦即破棄成例，則日籍董事將以多數而操縱工部局，所謂公共租界者將名存實亡，而變成事實的日本租界了。於此說來，驚訝疑懼，殊木許藐之為杞憂。</p>
<p>論上海租界，絕對不能覓致一種公認的確切估價。是文明都市，是萬惡淵藪？是國際貿易鉅埠，是世界商戰疆塲？是生產重鎮，是消耗洪鑪？是先驅而為時髦的陣營，是落伍而為古董的尾閭？是中國門戶，亦即現代文化灌輸中國的總站，是各國窟穴，亦即帝國主義侵凌中國的據點？在誰為天堂？在誰為地獄？總之，非但估價得由種種觀點、即在同一之觀點，亦復不一其估價。對於估價不一的任何事物，加以評述，似因不宜執一而論，遂致無法獲得定論，期根本不必評述；即如上海租界既懸殊其估價，則其名其實，為公共租界或為日本租界，似亦不値聞問。然而不然。中國領域之內，原有日本租界不止一處；但上海公共租界若化為日本租界，則其意義既不應僅視為日本租界又增加了一處，亦不應僅視為一處公共租界內的各國地位的角逐消長，却別有其嚴重意義。簡單說：上海公共租界倘若不能維持其原來情况，而事權盡入日本人掌握，則（一）即日本企圖扼住華中咽喉的成功，控制中國的梯堦：（二）即門戶開放與機會均等原則，在事實上歸於消滅；（三）即歐美各國勢必終於退出中國，退出遠東的初步；（四）即象徵了日本戰勝中國，同時打敗了各國。（五）中國曁各國在上海以及與上海脈絡相通的各地，一切資產，開始全部貶値。以至於等於零。如此廣泛而深刻的嚴重意義，應為任何人所不能否認。如此意義，當然不因上海租界本身的估價懸殊，而謂不妨斷送。</p>
<p>上海公共租界事權的消長轉移，其嚴重的意義，雖如上述的廣泛深刻，但與不日舉行的改選，以及目前準備改選期間的醞釀，必須分別體認。因為上海租界的母體，是洋涇浜章程，這所謂章程，十足備具國際條約的體態與素質，上海租界的運命，決之於國際環境，這所謂環境，完全以中國為重心而盤旋，現在則因中日戰爭而盤旋將臻終極；體認了這兩點，可以理解納稅西人年會中的改選，不問結果如何，並非對於公共租界斷定終身。申言之：假定本屆改選結果悉如舊觀，但公共租界悠久維持其原來情況，及其母體與運命的最强最善的保障，還在中國抗戰勝利後的尊重國際條約，澄淸國際環境。假定本屆政選結果乃為日本優勢，工部局竟歸日籍董事主宰，租界事權竟入日本人掌握，但此種變態的久暫，必不視下屆選舉如何爭競，而視中日戰爭的勝敗為轉移。此外，同時還須體認：納稅西人年會固不足以斷定公共租界的終身，而公共租界內各國地位的角逐消長，亦不足以影響中日戰爭的勝敗；莫謂消長，即使整個上海的得失，對於戰爭全局勝敗的確定，亦不夠分量。</p>
<p>這是確切不易的事理，亦上海公共租界前途的基本關鍵所在。說明這關鍵，絕非謂各國納稅僑民對於本屆改選，不妨放任，不妨坐視政選前的醞釀期間自然演變。但願各國僑民體認關鍵所在，自覺其對於中日戰爭初非無關切膚痛癢，無關切身利害，初不宜若隔岸觀火。尤願各國曁日本僑民體認關鍵所在，理解租界工部局若由改選而發生變化，輕事更張，則亦無所裨補於全局的任何一方面。要之，上海視國際條約與國際環境而『定性』，上海却不成為確定國際條約與國際環境的因素。</p>

<p>外匯昨日市況、匯豐掛牌、悉無上落、英美匯暗市空氣沉靜、上落殊微、此為多時未見之狀况、晨初因美英滙兌續漲二分有半、美會開盤即吿鬆〇六二五、先令則未更、且霎時間美匯曾喊六元〇九三七五買進、但有行無市而已、嗣以投機家乘賤吸納、洋行結進、一時俱來、而日洋行動作稍異、專事出炎扒美、致價遂漸形轉緊、六元〇六二五之價、結得不易、期貨趨　軟、雖現貨入後回平、　期貨仍俏、午後投機家　入場求售、市象重　硬化、復達六元〇九七五　價、期貨亦一致放長、這至收　、現美匯則為六元〇六二五、英金不動、（合美英滙兌二元五角二分七五）、結果比隔昨英平美硬〇六二五、期貨潛勢與現貨、稍有差別</p>
<p>日商出英金進美匯</p>
<p>晨初以倫敦大條近平遠縮〇六二五、紐約銀價仍平、倫敦生金呆定、滙兌英對美滬法等各匯俱平、美對英長二分半、對滬昂五分、對法大一分半、中央掛牌各滙如舊、銀行晨開現貨賣價、英金四便士一二五、美匯六元〇六二五、較之前收、英平美硬〇六二五、乃滙兌上漲之故、開後外行均有賣意、市面微硬、斯時現貨美滙六元〇九三七五可結、旋經投機商忽來扒吸、頓吿回平、計投機商及某外行互相扒進滙豐華義美行等本月份美匯五元九〇六二五、及下月份美滙五元六八七五、滙豐掛牌揭曉勿動、白銀平衡稅揭曉亦無升降、此後日洋行塞英扒美、同時投機商續來稍扒、而洋行界亦略有結款、市象稍轉軟化、計日洋行吐予有利五月份英金三便士九三七五、及扒進某行本月份美滙五元八七五、並五月份美滙五元六八七五、其時洋行界亦吸入外行現貨美匯六元〇六二五、及本月份英金四便士、斯時現貨美滙六元〇六二五難結、但不久外行供意轉濃、而買戶亦漸减少、遂形回平、迄至收盤、英金四便士一二五、美滙六元〇六二五、與晨開均無榮辱、而期貨央美滙則稍軟化、</p>
<p>投機多頭已有回出</p>
<p>後市初開平定現期均與午收相同、但不久因有少數投機商多頭忽來吐出、期貨遂吿硬化、計賣予外行本月份美匯五元九三七五、及外行互做本月份英金四便士〇三一二五、並外行又互做五月份美匯五元七八一二五、斯時現貨美滙曾喊六元〇九三七五、但頗難結得、延至收盤、英金四便士一二五、美匯六元〇六二五、本月份英金四便士〇三一二五、美匯五元九〇六二五、下月份英金三便士九二一八七五、美滙五元七五、結果比上日現貨英平、美長〇六二五、本月份英硬〇一五六二五、美賤〇六二五、下月份英平、美鬆〇九三七五、</p>
<p>香港匯市起伏不大</p>
<p>香港二日（週二）電、今晨滙市開盤吿平、英滙申匯均無變動、美匯現貨　一八七五、爲二十一元九三七五、日匯現貨亦長一元、為九二元五角、十時十五分、有轉軟模樣、美匯現貨回聚〇六二五爲二十一元八七五、十一時三十分告平、各滙概無變動、午牧美匯現貨不動、遠期開出為二十一元七五、下午二時三十分開盤、美匯現貨仍站原盤、遠期回鬆〇六二五、為二十一元八一二五、其餘均無榮辱、</p>
<p>天津英美俱見緊縮</p>
<p>天津二日（週二）電、今晨匯市開盤告平、英美匯現貨各緊〇六二五、英匯為三便士八七五、美滙為五元七五、申滙升一元五角、為一百〇五元五角、（聯鈔）暗盤賤一元七角五分、為一百二元二角五分、</p>
<h3 id="c52">多方猶圖掙扎　金市回小 <a href="#c52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>昨現金　赤暗然、市況情形恍惚、終日呈盤旋局勢、晨初以美英匯兌上漲、美匯帶鬆、但金市絕未受到若何影響、人心仍處於望漲氣氛中、故初開祗微跌五元、且繼之反猛漲三十元、達五千五百八十元高峯、蓋因證券帮扒入、引起買戶、奈不久證券帮忽起而塞出、賣聲喧騰、價乃不支、撳低達五千五百十元、惟午刻又見堅昂、午後銀號帮等買意股切、故曾升達五千五百七十五元、豈知此後賣風激動、五千五百元大關、一度險遭破入、主因證券帮及錢兌業等競售、雖另一證券帮尙來搜入，乃無如頭寸寬裕、收盤略回、結果五千五百十元、較上日軋小四十五元，全天交易約三千數百兩、銀樓飾金掛小五元、海關金等仍平、</p>
<p>赤先漲後跌</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）、初開匯兌報長、美滙吿硬、惟人心尙佳、致開市跌落無幾、首由某現金號進銀號三十兩、為五千五百五十元、比隔昨祗做小五元、嗣有某證券帮搜入、散戶亦先後買進頓漲起三十元、證券帮進金號十兩、為五千五百八十元、旋乃某錢兌集及另一瞪券帮多頭趁高出他、立回落三十元、後　加浮多亦來股　、且睡券帮繼續　塞、又降落三十餘元、銀號出某慶券帮二十兩，為五千五百十五元、此後某讓　代客拖進、而賣者已漸减少、遂回上二十三元、錢兌業進金號五十兩、為五千五百三十八元、第因某證券帮及錢兌業復來吐出、重又下降二十八元、金號出銀號十兩、為五千五百十元、後另一錢兌業反出為進、同時銀樓帮亦有購入、復見回升四十元、錢兌業進銀號三十兩、為五千五百五十元、將近收盤時、某銀號賣出步小十元、銀號出金號三十兩、為五千五百四十元、作午收價、午後開市抬高二十元、金號互做二十兩、為五千五百六十元、俄而銀號等買進、再高十五元、銀號進證券帮十兩、為五千五百七十五元、此後某證券帮忽來力售、頓見下挫、後雖另一證券帮乘機吸收二百餘兩、卒因斯時、外匯徵　、錢兌業及散戶等競賽於市、頭寸供求不勻、續跌數十元、金號出錢兌業卅兩、為五千五百元、後以美匯回平、錢兌業頓趁低補進、不久某證券帮亦反出為進、遂步高二十五元、金號進銀號十兩、為五千五百二十五元、人後因初時力扒之證劵幫、忽來復出、再又降落十五元、金號出銀號二十兩、為五千五百十元、作晚收價、，結果比上日回小四十五元、全天八十元上落、現金號之本牌金售價、照烚赤較高數元、收進减低二十元、現標金照掛牌金低五十餘元、均鮮做開、</p>
<p>飾金掛低五元</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出、初時大同行仍懸五百六十元、迨至午後三時三十五分、掛小五元、結果大同行改懸五百五十五元、新同行與上價相同、收進减低十五元光景、</p>
<h3 id="c53">外幣漲風已 <a href="#c53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>昨日外幣市况、英美金鎊晨間供求尙平、午後因金價盤旋下趨、各方供給較殷、市價緩緩步下、美金票終因鎊價續漲、及美滙轉鬆而跌、晨初賣氣殊盛、一度退至十六元三角、嗣雖又曾抬至十六元五角、但此項漲風僅為曇花一現、旋即抑低、遭遇後價為十六元三角七分、惟英金票趨勢尙堅挺、安南票需要不弱、法郞票供給甚暢、坎拿大票及斐律濱票均轉疲勢、日金票仍堅挺、晚市為一元三角一分三　、朝鮮票不乏需要者、市價續漲、晚市爲一元零三分、昨日市價、計英美金鎊各跌一元、英金票漲一角、美金票降一角五分、法郞票小二厘、安南票漲二分、坎拿大票及斐律濱票均跌一角、餘俱不動、</p>
<h3 id="c54">銀根日緊　貼現再高四元　拆息已達二角 <a href="#c54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>昨匯劃要據貼現率、盤高不止、每千元上午初即升至六十八元、繼更飛至七十二元、升高迄午始稍做低至七十元、午後　穩、仍七十元、比上日價再升四元、錢業公會拆息亦再掛高一分、建二角、晨午兩市均同、</p>

<p>上海銀行業聯合準備委員會自昨日起改訂各項利率如下、公單拆　息國幣二角八分、滙劃二角八分、承兌匯　九十日期貼　　幣二角八分、匯劃二角八分、價用同　　劃息一一角五分、同業匯劃　放欠息三角、（均　每千元每日計算）上項利率、與三月十二日一相　、國幣利率未有變動、滙劃利率均增三分、</p>

<p>米市自前一緊即疲後、昨晨似無好面、然竟出意料、又能　　直上、繼升一元有奇、最高時若一號西貢開四十六元半、二號四十二元半、火　四十五元、小　四十一元半、惟復一經漲高、銷塲轉呆、又復回貶、內地及鄉　客戶、以　來市面　趨盤旋、腳地頗堅、　爲一時似無十分小面、遂均出手搜羅、客販又把持不放、此係一貫作風、市面又再昂元奇、作客一動即復停手、及酒水放長之訊、行市又小、至收盤乃與前市不相上下、粳糯國米到貨雖屬不多、昨由虹口轉出者祇一千餘包、然銷塲亦殊平常、結果與洋</p>
<p>洋米晨市承前日下午期貨上漲之餘風、市場買氣甚濃、而現貨除本客實銷外、行囤投機亦頗活潑、故現貨售價立被抬起五六角、一號西貢又至四十六元、惟回籠期貨早市一度見俏後、即有多頭乘機出籠、兼因金價回平、國外報價亦低、市乃初挺繼平、午後又以賣風復熾見疲、回籠二號西貢四五月份早市開五十一元二角、午刻四月已小至五十元零七八角、下午耶日交貨降至五十元零五角、尙難盡量售出、四月份一號五十三元半、下午喊小半元、仍朱售開、小絞四十九元半、　暹五十元零三角、全日期貨共開七百多噸、現貨約有六千包、</p>
<p>另訊、杜米市情、　來到貨淸稀、尤其白粳為最、市存殊形參落、昨據記者探悉，某日商洋行頃自無錫運抵大批粉粳、數在三千包以上業有六百包以四十三元低價售予糧商、致昨日國米暗盤大受打擊、早市尙呈平站、後市卒趨疲勢、無　頂　四十七元降至四十六元半、黃　白　自四十五元退至四十四元、靑浦高薄稻四十五六元、角里薄稻四十三元七角，</p>
<h3 id="c57">回籠粉十挺　麥價呆定 <a href="#c57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>麵粉昨市續穩、查二號粉廠盤仍為十三元八角、屹立未動、而回籠粉老車牌前經一度鬆落後、已比廠盤為廉、故內地鄉莊略有進取、惟目下客銷迄難好轉、人心殊覺平淡、聞綠礮車雖有十五元之客盤、但無正式成交、老車牌棧單昨開十三元七角七八分、比前日提高數分、日廠粉鳳凰牌雙獅牌等亦見微升、統市成交僅二三千包、本街向廠零批、約有六七千包云、</p>
<p>小麥　頗呈呆定之象、通來廠需不濃、囤戶與出口帮亦鮮問津、惟貨主一味執住、不願輕脫、故市面漲跌兩難、結果仍祗阜豐廠辦去無錫麥一千餘包、價仍為二十三元五角云、</p>

<p>證劵暗盤、昨日市況極為平　、多方抱逢小收進主意、但亦不瑚拍價、料此後行市、商漲必在空方之扺補、目下大都為掉換交易、捨此取彼以為巧計、惟丙種行將抽簽空方不無顧忌耳、昨日上午、德孚益昌久豐恒孚均有買進、恒康入丙獨多、樂茂則入乙出丙、永康又獨取甲種、聯益及散戶大都賣出、行市稍稍趨堅、午後丙種交易最多、同康鴻康及四十一號均有相當需要、而三十八號四十一號及樂茂丙種供出獨多、取捨眼光各有不同、一方樂茂又收進乙種、四十一號又收進甲種、元康均有需要、在各方取捨不同間、結果略有參差、惟祇五分一角上落而已、成交總數約計八十萬元左右、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>股票交易、成交冠生園股三十股、價為三十五元正、</p>
<p>衆業股市受制於賣方壓力、晨初拍板後之一小時內、價格甚形不支、但低價招致多方活動、故不久大都恢復原價、然買方出高價收購者、亦復甚寥、結果市况轉趨寗靜、怡和紗廠股因紗便高翔引人注意、英聯股過去一二星期中幾於被人澳視頃謠傳工潮解決、復有向上之勢、收盤三十八元二五有買戶、中國墾植股成交極夥、雖交易過程中、賣方對此勢力雄厚、價格尙能站穩、據皮股黯淡、買賣雙方甚少活動、簡格志成交尙多、收盤極穩、三十二元七五之價、不乏有人購進、</p>
<p>倫教一日（運一）電、今日英商遠東各公司股票掛牌行市、上落甚微、保安保險股上漲一鎊半、價為二十九鎊半、古拉客林傍橡皮股疲落三便士、價為十八先令九便士、</p>

<p>紗市由平轉緊、趨勢良好、此因上日粵　採、殊旺、以致人心堅挺、買氣仍熾、美匯雖見放長、貿者依然熱烈、二十支雙馬本月份已到一千一百四十元、</p>
<p>現紗晨開、開英美匯兌放長、人氣平和、二十支雙馬本月開價為一千一百十元、低價一開、買戶紛紛而來、市盤乃步步上升、至一千一百四十五元、後經獲利者略有吐出、又復回下三四元、香半日間成交統計四千三百三十五包、行情二十支雙馬現貨價漲三十五元、二日棉紗出口、五百二十件運海防、一百零五件運　港、六十五件運天津、又疋頭七十五件運香港、八十二件運烟台、一百十件運天津、三百七十件運海防、茲將各帮買去之現紗額量、分列如左、同行二、五〇五香港一、八三〇統計四、三三五</p>

<p>本棉交易、殊為沉悶、申新廠略有進胃點綴外、其他廠家絕少進展、此因印棉下跌甚厲、採辦價頗廉、且花號購錄音室之貨甚夥、於此市面受其壓迫矣、所以紗價雖節節前進、棉花反形背這而馳、加之外滙轉形放長、棉市前途、就此未許樂觀也、茲將現棉情形如左、</p>

<p>另訊外棉市價、紐約棉市、昨日晨初光因受及賣方壓力之增加、而市降落、後又因現貨商之賣出、及南京帮之在市套賣、結果收盤價格較之上日降落八九磅音、印度昨日繼續跌落、連同預測又降四羅比、埃及降三四磅音、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、日來因紗價之飛漲、廠方稍有講意、故市上印棉現貨、幾被搜購一空、現各方正在訂購即裝貨、此項印棉將於五月下旬方可絡續抵埠、其售價較之本花尙可廉去十餘元，日方廠商則較為靜寂、茲將昨日棉市以美滙六元零六二五折合送廠價如下、</p>

<p>昨日絲市、日美回跌均巨、紐約近期小九分、遠期小一角、橫濱現貨晨開一五三零元跌五零元、遠期一九三九元跌三十二元、下午收盤又跌五十元左右、是故本埠絲市、乃吿沉寂、白廠經輯里經　電價澳洋行限價相距六七十元、（輯里發電價二九〇〇元特上等級、廠經價五〇〇〇元）預計尙難成交、昨國外回跌、當與上月份紐約生絲實銷有關、蓋三月份紐約生絲情况、仍無好轉徵象也、</p>

<p>下星期內　分日選舉</p>
<p>據昨日可靠方面消息、公共租界歷史上最困難而重要之選舉、將於下星期內（四月十日及十一日）舉行、在此次選舉中、參加競選者、共計十三人之多、而當選額僅為九名、據昨日下午官方發表、該十三名候選人中、包括英僑五名、（即海萊、凱自威、羅特立克麥唐納、密啟爾、及　惠爾、）美僑二人、（即卡納及阿樂滿）日僑五名、（即堉雄太郞、岡本乙一、黑田慶太郞、岡本一策、田誠、）此外獨立候選人一名為雷諾麥唐納、（英僑規定每千人產生候選人一名、此為五人之外之一名、）共計十三人、至投票時間、則定為兩日之上午十時至下午三時、又據工部局昨日發表、薛爾斐氏已由勃克提議、密拉附議、被選為地產委員矣、</p>
<p>變更現狀　勢不可能</p>
<p>據昨日觀察者　、此次選舉、將成為最緊張之一頁、蓋合各方所推舉之候選人數、現已撕毀「君子協定、」彼等均以為日僑決不能在工部局中獲得五名董事之地位、至於其所能獲得之人數、須視西人投選日僑票數而定、彼等以為在下星期內、在此三國之中、或可成立一種協定、昨日在英國僑民中、業已發出「保持原有狀態」之口號、雖日方一再宣稱、並不欲統制工部局行政、但日僑候選人如在工部局中　得絕對或比較的多數、則工部局行政上勢必引起變化也、</p>
<p>志在奪取　英國位置</p>
<p>本屆工事日僑選舉委員會主席林雄吉、會於一日上午十一時發表聲明、茲錄原文如下、「日本方面此次使五名市參事會員為候補起見、決定參加選舉戰、上海日本人口、近來急激增加、現在租界內及租界周圍之日本人口、已達七萬、故公共租界市參事會有選舉權者數額、今年已近三千數百、在各國有選舉權者數額內、斷然占第一位、遙為超越現在有五名市參會員之英國方面之有選舉權者二千八百名、因而日本方面希望將現在之市參事會員二名增至五名、理屬當然、然而日本方面所企圖者、排除租界上特定國之獨裁、圖謀租界之國際化、使寓住租界之各國人、均能公平參與租界行政、又作工部局機構及財政之根本的再檢討、使租界置於恒久而且堅實之基礎上、因而增進租界上各國人之福利、決非日本方面企圖獨占租界行政、</p>
<p>欲使租界　趨國際化</p>
<p>日本方面此次立五名市參事會員者、一欲打破租界變則的機構、不外為日本方面達到其目的之必要手段、然日本方面亦非永遠固執五名市參事會員、即日本方面之理想、具體言之、日本方面先欲修正不適於現狀之現行土地章程之規定、增多市參事會員、俾使各國悉可公平參與租界行政、如此事不能立即實施、則使現在九名市參事會員與比率、儘量謀其公平而且國際化、日本方面為達此目的起見、必須先加强日本方面對租界行政之發言權、</p>
<p>租界主觀　仍屬中國</p>
<p>英文大美晚報社評略云、雖目前在滬日僑人數、確已增多、但日僑在租界內根本缺乏歷史性、且如以人口而決定候選人之數額、則華人早可操縱租界內一切、故租界乃以經濟之因素為基礎、而西人在滬之經濟權益、自較日人為多、至於租界之將來、一般均認為終有完全交還中國之一日、但日人欲在租界內佔絕對優勢、西僑則不能同意、日人目前尙在進行對華之侵略戰爭、而戰爭中之日本地位、並不優越、故西僑認為日僑現無要求接管之權利、故西僑對日方目前之行動、一致表示反對、其理由有二、（一）租界行政業已西方化、除非獲得中國政府同意、絕不能變更行政態度、而任另一方面把持之、（二）日人雖宣稱、於接管後可使租界「眞正國際化」、但西僑均以為過去之事實、不足為此舉之保證、反之、根據已往經騐、日人如接管租界行政、工部局勢將變化為「日本　　二、</p>
<p>英美權益　關係至鉅</p>
<p>宇林西報社評略云、此次日方突然宜布增加候選人至五名之多、對此上海歷史上從未發現之事實、本届工部局董事選舉、事態遂趨於嚴重、吾人深信正確嚴格之事實、已置於租界納稅人之前、日僑在滬人數之增多及權力之擴張、是否即足以超過華人、即獲得工部局行政管理之權、此不待思考、即可斷言也、英美日三國候選人人數比例之君子協定、行之已有數年、今由於日僑人數之加多、即要求增加董事人數、此種要求、在去年即經各方注意、現日人遽宣布候選人增至五名之多、是則本屆納稅入選舉時、原在十二名候選人中、選出九人　、然吾人以為日方並無充分理由、增加其候選人至五名之多、目前之事實、不過為日人已決定作一試探、以證明日橋是否在滬可以操絕對多數之左券也、上海都市之建立、旣全賴西方人士之努力、英美僑民之權益、又遠勝於日人、即就其義務（納稅）而言、亦復如是、是以整個選舉機會之均等、絕不能僅以人數多寡而定、由於西人權益之佔多數、西人實需要在工部局行政上有統制權、但目前情况之混亂、實足產生不良結果、如此事能以協定方式解決、則猶可容忍、吾等希望凡願工部局行政保持原有狀態之英美僑民、一致能決定目前彼等所應取之步驟、如是則唯有擁護英僑候選人為五人及美僑候選人為二人、始可有保持原狀之機會、目前明顯之事實、為納稅人不能盡其應盡之責職、則彼等將來必受日橋候選人增加之影響、可以斷言、際此緊急關頭、耶所以決定、此後之工部局、究為西方人士抑為東方人士之統制、</p>
<p>成立協定　減少人數</p>
<p>泰晤士報社評自昨日日方宣布增加候選人至五名後、選舉事宜、更足引起一般人之注意、按照往年英美日僑候選人之比例、向爲五二二制、本年度英美僑民、充其極度、亦不過預料日董或將增加一名、今日方竟宜布增加至五名之多、實足令人驚異、日僑人數雖已臻七萬人之多、納稅者亦有三千人、足以超渦英僑人數、驟視之日方此種要求、似不過分、但就各國僑民慮及以後工部局行政樣之統制問題、對日人以此種權益攫取、自足引起堅決反對、據日僑選舉委員會主席林雄吉氏談、日人目的乃使各國在工部局中能有公正及平等之代表人數、共同管理工部局事宜、此意固佳、然如日人在事前未能獲得絕對多數之擁護者、亦屬徒然、且由於日僑候選人數增至五名之多、則本年度工部局西董、則須由十二人中（英僑五人美僑二人日僑五人）提選九名、惟吾等絕難深信英美日僑候選人須再作一次競選、故其解決之方式、非再成立協定减少候選人數不可、</p>
<p>歐美選民　合作制日</p>
<p>據日方宣稱、日僑納稅人達三千人、故本屆工部局董事競選、日方推出候選人竟增至五名之多、違反歷來慣例、迫壤地皮章程、本埠西僑候選人有鑒於此、已勸吿默美選舉人、勿投票選舉日人、以為抵制、</p>

<p>該「場」營業、爲採取拍板交易之方式、即日偽將截獲地貨、由加入之地貨商出價最高者購入、再由此仲賣人轉批予菜販、手續繁多、剝削重重、日偽所拍售之地貨、均為以最低　格　截强購所得、在拍售時、將最高價格、售於地貨商人、故日偽獲利、頗為豐厚、利息達三成之多、一般鄕民、昔日販運地貨至滬、原可得一成以上之利者、現因日偽統制、致收入大受打擊、其所獲利息、僅可與運輸費用相抵、在此物價高漲、鄉人頗多以販售地貨為生、至此遂受莫大打擊、生活益感苦痛矣、</p>

<h3 id="c94">「中國屋主應同情中國災黎」 <a href="#c94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>— 不仁</p>
<p>法租界的鐵門開放以後，我們就在報上看到「該處秩序業已恢復」的通告各房客公鑒的廣吿；但是報章上吿訴我們的是烟館烟窟遍地皆是，而目還有白畫侮辱少女的慘劇。各房客自然比各房東能够注意及此，所以「進出者較前繁忙，惟來租界者仍多於進南市者」，對於「並無遺物」的房屋，都「自願放棄租賃關係」。至於「欠租」，當然請各房東自認吃虧了。</p>
<p>然而奇怪的事更有甚於此者，難民區的業主也要求遷讓，意圖厚利出租。他們的理由猜想起來也以爲（該處秩序業已恢復」吧。並不催索欠租」，祗要求「遷讓」，似乎對難民還十分客氣的了。</p>
<p>可是請業主們回憶一下三年前南市慘遭轟炸的時候，饒神父努力奔走劃爲難民區的時候吧。「查南市半壁城廂，在中日戰事之中，得以保存無燬者，全賴中日雙方政府同意，將南市一部份劃爲難民區，充作收容難民之用。」饒神父爲難民奔走而得保全的這半壁城廂，現在居然「要求遷讓」，其不怕面上發燥乎？</p>
<p>「中國屋主應同情中國災黎，方能表現其應盡之義務。」這句話見諸一個法國人的饒神父信中，我祗能擱筆長歎了！</p>
<h3 id="c95">寫在詩歌朗誦大會後 <a href="#c95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>— 民強</p>
<p>行列社主催的詩歌朗誦會，終於在行列社各社員的勢力之下，在三月三十一日女靑年會禮堂內舉行第一次詩歌朗誦大會。這恐怕也就是抗戰以後滬上第一次公開的詩歌朗誦會吧。我大胆的　，這一次詩歌朗誦會並不像我們預期的那樣好，雖然我們不應該過份的苛求，正因爲這還是行列社主催的第一次公開朗誦會。但是我在聽罷之餘，就不得不將我那熱烈愛護中國詩歌朗誧前途的赤誠心，給與行列社最大的愛護。今日護以聽後所感覺到的，作一個小小的貢獻給行列社</p>
<p>（一）詩歌應該和廣大的羣衆的生活連發生在一起。這就是說：詩歌是羣衆的，正如國家是羣眾的一樣。所以在詩歌朗誦會中，我們不應該收費太高。收費的標準應該以廣大民衆的生活水準爲標準，將收費盡量减低　使得一般平民百姓都有參加「朗誦詩歌」的機會，以免造成「詩歌的朗誦」是資產階級的享有物。這一次詩歌朗誦會的收費是一律四角，我想這個收費未免太高了一點。我希望下次的詩歌朗誦會的收費至少要比這一次减少一半。</p>
<p>（二）這一次所朗誦的詩歌，我覺得太偏重於長詩的一方面，短詩是少得可憐。在朗誦技術方面，高潮和低潮欠有力，尤其是關露女士的朗誦，她的詩潮目始至終一樣的。</p>
<p>（三）這一次朗誦的詩，正如行列社代表的致詞一樣：「我們還沒有達到大眾化這一個目標。」這是朗誦詩歌最重要的一個問題。詩和活的語言是不能分家的，努力「詩運」的人是不可以忽略這一點的。</p>
<p>（四）關於朗誦用的言語方面，最好是用國語。雖然我並不反對地方語的朗誦，因爲現在各地國語還是不很流行。但是在上海這個地方，朗誦詩歌除了上海語之外，就應以國語爲主了，例如這一次詩歌朗誦會裏有個人是用汕頭語來朗誦，立刻使得大多數的聽衆發出嘖嘖之聲，表示聽小懂。</p>
<p>末了，我希望努力「詩運」的人和行列社社員努力去實踐你們的宣言：「從這種朗誦運動裏，從詩歌的活的語言的重新結合裏，將要產生詩歌的新的生命。」</p>

<p>邵慧華聽了，暗暗在好笑，她想：人家說女人有譽夫癖的，也有譽兒癖的，像瞿無雙小姐，可算是一位有譽報癖的人了。但她確是一位忠實於報館的人，惟其有忠實於報館的人，報館纔能發達呢。吳君素道：「那末幾位撰述先生，都是住居在報館裏的嗎？』瞿無雙道：有的住在報館裏，有的不住在報館裏，就是編輯先生們，也是如此。住在報館裏的，我們六層樓上有宿舍，倒也還舒適。不住在報館裏的，我們報館裏有汽車接送，或是幾位撰述與編輯先生，自己有汽車的，雖到深夜回去，也沒有什盡妨礙呀。就只住在報館裏的，住房由報館供給，膳食却歸自理。你喜歡吃西菜也吧，中菜也吧，這裏都有，只要關照廚房便了。而且你要游戲消遣，屋頂上有小花園，小球塲，練身房，一切齊備。尤具便利的，就在六層樓，還有一個圖書館。這圖書館，並不向外公開，專供館內人的瀏覽。書當然不及外間大圖書館的多，便是有一樣，凡是全世界所出的各種雜誌，以及全中國所出的雜誌，無不齊備。」又指着撰述室裏的書櫥道：「這裏頭，不過幾種參攷的書，做論說時，時常要翻檢的，所以放在手頭。此外要什麼書，儘可以到圖書館裏去謂取呢。所以有兩位喜歡看書看雜誌的，常常日埋頭於書館中呀。」吳君素道：「是呀！那末到這裏來當一位編輯員，或是撰述員，倒是很舒服寫意的呀！邵慧華笑道：「君素姊！你不　羨慕我們，我勸你不如改了行吧？你等東吳大學的台同滿後，不要做大學敎授，我們兩人來保舉你，到這裏來當報館記者吧！任憑你願意當編輯員，或是撰述員。」吳君素道：「我且問你！你爲什麼不住報館裏，却只是跳出跳進的到處亂跑呢？」瞿無雙却是搖着手，笑道：『罷　！她是要敎她安安靜靜坐在這裏一天，她便覺得周身不舒服咧。有一天，她也是跑到圖書館裏去，預備看書了，翻翻這本，翻翻那本，外國雜誌翻了有廿幾本。大家說：你却是同小孩子一般，只是看看畫圖罷了。而且她所看的，只是屬於運動，游泳，騎馬，划船的一類雜誌，那都是我們這裏的撰述先生所不要看的書。」　（二五八）</p>
<h3 id="c97">街頭所見 <a href="#c97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>偶然在一家弄口，看到一個尙未滿十歲的孩子，衣衫是　褸的，一隻耳朶下還穿着一絲金屬品的身環，口裏啣着一根烟捲，隨即用兩個小指頭在嘴邊摘下一段烟蒂，而且那麼輕輕的又敏疾的彈去烟灰，實足以使我不禁驚奇而　為「老氣橫秋」的經騐，究竟從什麼地方學得來！有許多孩子，那是也在街頭看見的。一種舉重，簡直不堪入目。那樣一個食指舉點着自己的鼻尖，身子捐了兩擺，肩子聳了幾聲，聳出一張刁骨而且暴戾的鬼臉來，一個個小小的拳頭攔腰向同伴塞過去的時候，還加上這麼一句非常鬆脆的：「顏色在這裏！」</p>
<p>這類形勁，看到的想必不少，但從來少有人說過或寫過這樣的事情，這便乾脆地可說有識之士也不無消極獎進之處。我為十年後的社會，捏一把冷汗！</p>

<p>我們對事，對物，和對人所抱的觀念，是很重要的一件事，尤其對人是好此。所以重要，是因爲這種觀念，不但關係到我們自己，並且多少關係到他人。一個人接受了他人的意見，不免照那意見的高低而蒙其福或受其害。我們的意見旣於人有關係，或說我們旣對人抱了一種觀念如那人的地位是重要的，我們觀念所發生的影響便越大。若所說的那人是耶穌呢。那我們的水生，簡直有賴于我們對他所抱的觀念了。說到我們對耶穌常抱的觀念。先讓我們看石他人的思想是怎樣，縱或我們不盡贊同他們的思想，然於我們是多少有益的。當耶穌的名譽，傳遍各地的時候，耶穌從外而回到家裏來。他信步步進禮拜堂敎訓人。聽的人當時對他作何感想？他們聽了耶穌的話生氣說，「這不是約瑟的兒子嗎？他不是木匠嗎」他們隨口說出「耶穌是木匠，　有想到這句話，正表明了這位從卑微出身的加利利人一耶穌有驚人的發展。他們觀念中，　不曾想到這位耶穌要用人生的木料，造成聖殿，給上帝居住。他們只用看常人的眼光去看耶穌，以爲他不過是拿了刀鉅工作的近人而已。他們第一個觀念是耶穌不學無術。耶穌未進學校讀書，在文學講自然比不上當時的文士之流。但是，這種觀念也不盡正確，如果正確，普世的人，爲何瘋狂般的趨向他來呢？人們心中雖則常常浮起這種疑問，但還是信從他，因爲他們聽了耶穌的道理，覺得心中能得着新的感動。什麼原故呢？因爲這未入校讀書的耶穌，有知人之明，能牧精神上解釋人生的價値。一個人比一隻牟好多少？好至不能比擬。牧人爲失羊捨命，耶穌要爲因犯罪喪失生命的人捨命。（待續）　如欲詳細研究請函郵箱一二二七號</p>

<p>美國·　美國原是電影業最發達的國家，但對於兒童電影的重視，還是最近四年來的事，除了各州州立及地方建立的兒童電影院外，更努力於學校兒童電影攝製；到目前爲止，美國各小學都　一架或一架以上的電影放映機了。</p>
<p>英國·　英國近年來對於兒童電影逐漸重視，特由國家組織兒童電影檢查會，將各項影片加以審查，凡合於兒童敎育的電影，標以「A」字，在各地兒童電影院放映，同時更獎勵影片公司攝製兒童電影。</p>
<p>法國·　法國的兒章電影偏重於傳記（如二童女貞德等）及科學片。每星期日或例假，常有兒童電影巡廻隊在各鄕村間開映，且每逢七月十四那天，在巴黎舉行兒童電影討論大會，出席者有各學校校長，電影從業員，新聞訊者，家長等。</p>
<p>德國·　德國是最先注重兒童電影的國家，由政府，家庭和電影從業員三者共同合作。平時各電影院不論開映甚麼影片，絕對禁止兒童們踏進影院，但在星期日那天，各電影院一律放映兒童教育片，如「興登堡傳」，一大文豪歌德」等，專給兒童們觀看，並且不收門票。</p>
<p>義大利·　義大利可以說最注重兒童電影了，除了設立免費兒童電影院，推廣學校敎育電影外，對於檢查方面更規定了種種條例，一切費用，完全由國家負担。所映兒童電影的題材，都偏重於科學，歴史，風俗習慣，工業及法西斯主義方面。</p>
<p>荷蘭·　荷蘭禁止兒童觀看偵探片愛情及恐怖片，前年「白雪公主」在荷蘭各地放映時，因恐怖成份過多，禁止十六歲以下兒童觀看。</p>

<p>— 娟</p>
<p>藝林劇社將於四月七日晨十時假座卡爾登戲院上演三幕劇西施，由顧若之編導。我想在看西施以前，先寫些感想：很小的時候就知道，我們中國在「春秋」的時候有一個女人，美麗的化身。名字是西施。據說西施是浙江省諸暨縣苧蘿山苧蘿村的人。大的是（浣紗孃。」很奇怪的，她浣紗的地方在杭州。好幾年了，我到杭州去遊歷，記得從西湖濱到貢院去的途中就有個巷子名叫浣紗巷，被馬路截成東西兩段。講起西施事跡頗像眞有其人，但是也有以爲她是傳說的人物。顧若之的劇本怎樣寫法？我不知道，但是我眞有些偏見。的確，這樣一個主角的劇本一定是詩意的。邵洵美的意見我很贊同，，應該是個詩劇？</p>
<p>邵洵美在一個人的談話裏，他說出了他想編這一齣劇本的心願：「西施，假使眞有這樣一個人，她的聰明與能幹是可以相信的，但是我們决不能忘記她是一個「人」。　時，我們還得明白夫差的人格。以這樣一位美人而配合這樣一位英雄，我想，故事便不會如此簡單。夫差也是喫過苦來的，這樣一位賢明又勇敢的英雄是否一見敵國獻來的美人便神智昏迷？西施是有了修養的，這樣一位情感豐富的美人是否對着鐘情她的英雄，心腸會硬的起來，手段又會這樣地殘酷？真的，寫這齣劇本之前，須知道西施是個人，平平凡凡的二個「人！不是超人」！所以她有優點，也有缺點，決不是「英雄」！同時，也得知道夫　是個什麼樣的人！怎樣的性格！</p>
<p>邵洵美的意見，我想是値得編西施的人考慮商量！</p>
<h3 id="c102">可愛的「香妃」 <a href="#c102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>

<p>近來注意國產影業的人，爲了「時裝片」與古裝片　，發揮了諸般議論，我的意見，但問影片本身的「善」與「惡」，不必斤斤「時」與「古」之爭。「美的」影片，時裝好，古裝也好；「惡的」形片，時裝不好，古裝也不好。不過製片家應雙方兼顧，以調劑觀衆的口味，像現兮一味傾向於「古」而忽於「時」，也是不行的。</p>
<p>昨天看過「香妃」的試映，一覺得很滿意，古裝片看過好多部，「香妃」我認為超特的作品。我們平時總感到劇情意識，國片勝於外片，而攝製技術，國片差於外片，惟獨「香妃」的導演手法，攝影與收音，俱臻上乘，可稱國片之佼佼者。胡梯維君編「香妃」，還是處女作，然整個劇情，組織得熱烈緊張，忠義千秋，足見滿腹錦繡，値得欽佩。演員方面，王熙春，屠光啟，陳琦，都很稱職，其他亦在水準以上，兩支　及蒙古音樂，古樂等，都很勵聽，在此時此地演此戲，可說興奮之至。</p>

<h3 id="e1">The Chinese Army in Southern Guangxi Launches a Fierce Multidirectional Attack; Japanese Forces Near Xiaodong Are Heavily Besieged; Chinese Forces in Eastern Guangdong Attack Near the Outskirts of Chaozhou City in Intense Fighting; Chinese Units Crossing the River Launch an Attack on Remnant Japanese Forces in Sanshui and Other Areas <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Binyang: After the Japanese forces in southern Guangxi were defeated near Lingshan by the Chinese army, the Chinese forces have been pursuing them in multiple directions, taking advantage of their victory. One route is currently attacking Xiaodong, a crucial stronghold for the Japanese. They have already cut off the highways near the area and are heavily besieging the Japanese, with fierce battles to annihilate them taking place. Another route, after severely defeating the stubborn Japanese forces in Zhuoyang Township, Liuwei, and other areas, has now reached near Liangqingwei. They are fiercely attacking the Japanese forces massing around Tingziwei. (Reported on the 2nd)</p>
<p>Meixian: After the Chinese forces repelled the Japanese army from Chaozhou and Shantou, they launched another fierce attack on Bijia Mountain the night before. Another unit advanced to the outskirts of Chaozhou City and is currently engaged in intense fighting with newly arrived Japanese reinforcements. (Reported on the 2nd)</p>
<p>Liuzhou: After the recovery of strongholds such as Twelve Altars and Nachen along the Yongqin Road, the Japanese forces at Datang have been ambushed by Chinese forces from both the front and rear, suffering heavy casualties. On the night of the 30th, the Chinese army launched a fierce assault, once breaking into the Japanese lines, killing hundreds of Japanese soldiers and burning down many Japanese barracks and warehouses. They are still under siege. (Reported on the 2nd)</p>
<p>Sihui: After the Japanese forces in Sanshui and other areas were defeated by the Chinese army after crossing the river to launch an invasion, the Chinese army took advantage of their victory on the night of the 30th and crossed the river in multiple directions to pursue the fleeing Japanese forces. One unit surrounded Fengyong, engaging in fierce fighting throughout the night, causing heavy casualties to the Japanese. Another unit advanced to Sanshui and near the southwest, and is currently engaged in intense fighting with the Japanese. (Reported on the 2nd)</p>
<p>Xingning: A unit of the Japanese army from Chunma Mountain in Chao'an attacked Yu City (southwest of Chaozhou City) on the morning of the 31st. The Chinese army engaged them in battle until 4 PM, when the Japanese forces retreated completely. (Reported on the 1st)</p>

<p>Chongqing: Rumors that the Japanese army is determined to clear out the Chinese forces in the inland mountains of Hainan Island have been confirmed by military sources there. Here, people have been speculating about the motives behind the Japanese army's military actions on the island. Many believe that at a time when the Japanese are in urgent need of troops to fight on the mainland, the deployment of a large army (approximately 30,000 men) from southern Guangxi to Hainan must have a significant reason. Currently, only a small number of Chinese security forces are guarding the mountains of Hainan. Therefore, it is believed that the Japanese army is determined to clear out the Chinese forces on the island so that they can establish permanent naval and air bases there, as a starting point for expansion into the South Pacific. It is also believed that the Japanese army is using such a large force in order to take advantage of the opportunity presented by the European war to expedite the completion of their plans in Hainan Island.

<h3 id="e9">Japanese Blockade of Macau Affects Hong Kong's Food Supply; Macau Will Enter a Critical Period; Authorities and Public Remain Silent <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>Hong Kong: Japan's food blockade of Macau this week has affected the supply of food sources to Hong Kong today. According to shipping circles, only one-tenth of Macau's food supplies are currently able to reach Hong Kong. Vegetables and fresh fish, which mostly come from Macau, have therefore increased significantly in price today. The Japanese began implementing the food blockade of Macau after occupying Zhongshan this week. A reporter from the South China Morning Post stated, "In the past two days, the Japanese have not allowed any food to pass through the blockade into Macau, with only a small amount of vegetables specially permitted to be transported to certain private individuals in Macau." "If Japan does not lift its blockade, Macau will enter a dangerous period. What is most strange is that the Macau authorities and the public are remaining silent about this." The news of the Japanese blockade of Macau first emerged after the Japanese side made a request. The Japanese requested that Portugal withdraw its troops stationed on Lapa Island. After the Japanese army occupied Zhongshan, the Macau authorities were forced to allow the Japanese army to search Macau for anti-Japanese elements. (United Press, 2nd)</p>

<h3 id="e11">The Re-election of Directors in the Shanghai International Settlement and the Future of the Settlement <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>Will the Shanghai International Settlement ultimately become a Japanese settlement? If it does, what dramatic changes will follow? How great will be the associated impacts and interests? Is this an unconscious question, an unconscious assumption? Is this a phenomenon so utterly impossible that it need not be imagined? In our view, this should not be dismissed as unnecessary to imagine; rather, we should recognize its unimaginable consequences. In recent days, some have already detected this issue and are in surprise and fear.</p>
<p>What is the issue? In recent days, the term of office for the directors of the Shanghai Municipal Council has expired, and re-elections will be held on the 17th of this month, leaving only two weeks. According to established precedents, the board consists of five Chinese directors, five British directors, and two each from the United States and Japan. Except for the Chinese directors, who are elected by the Chinese Ratepayers' Association, the British, American, and Japanese directors are elected by the Western Ratepayers' Association. Before the Western Ratepayers' Association formally convenes for the vote, the various national expatriate groups in Shanghai first separately produce a corresponding number of candidates. This time, however, the Japanese side has suddenly broken with precedent and put forward as many as five candidates. In terms of numbers, the Japanese expatriates hold almost the largest number of voting rights by nationality. If they abandon the gentleman's agreement of 5-5-2-2, that is, break with precedent, then the Japanese directors will control the Municipal Council with a majority, and the so-called International Settlement will exist in name only and become a de facto Japanese settlement. In light of this, surprise and fear are hardly akin to worrying about something as trivial as the sky falling.</p>
<p>When discussing the Shanghai Settlement, it is impossible to find a universally agreed-upon accurate assessment. Is it a civilized city, or a den of all evils? Is it a major international trading port, or a battlefield for global commercial warfare? Is it a manufacturing hub, or a voracious furnace of consumption? Is it a pioneer, leading the way in fashion, or a laggard, a relic of the past? Is it China's gateway, the main station for the infusion of modern culture into China, or is it a haven for various countries, a stronghold for imperialist aggression against China? Is it paradise for some, or hell for others? In short, not only does the assessment vary according to different perspectives, but even within the same perspective, the assessment is inconsistent. For any subject with such divergent evaluations, to comment upon it seems inappropriate to insist on one point of view, ultimately leading to no firm conclusion and perhaps rendering any commentary unnecessary. Similarly, given the wide range of evaluations of the Shanghai Settlement, whether it is in name and in fact an International Settlement or a Japanese Settlement seems not worth asking. However, this is not the case. Within Chinese territory, there are already more than one Japanese settlement; but if the Shanghai International Settlement were to become a Japanese settlement, its significance should not be seen merely as another Japanese settlement added to the list, nor should it be seen merely as a shift in the competitive positions of various countries within one International Settlement. It carries a separate, grave significance. Simply put: If the Shanghai International Settlement cannot maintain its original state and if control falls entirely into the hands of the Japanese, then (1) Japan's attempt to strangle the throat of central China and control China will succeed; (2) the principles of the Open Door and equal opportunity will be effectively eliminated; (3) European and American countries will inevitably withdraw from China and the Far East; (4) Japan will symbolize its victory over China, defeating all countries simultaneously; (5) all assets of China and various countries in Shanghai and in areas connected to Shanghai will begin to depreciate entirely, eventually becoming worthless. This widespread and profound significance cannot be denied by anyone. Such significance, of course, should not be forfeited simply because of the divergent assessments of the Shanghai Settlement itself.</p>
<p>The ebb and flow of power within the Shanghai International Settlement, its grave significance, though as widely and deeply impactful as described above, must be distinguished from the upcoming elections and the current period of preparation for the elections. Because the underlying foundation of the Shanghai Settlement is the Land Regulations, and these so-called Regulations fully possess the form and substance of an international treaty. The fate of the Shanghai Settlement is determined by the international environment, and this so-called environment revolves entirely around China as its center, now nearing its final stage due to the Sino-Japanese War. By recognizing these two points, one can understand that the elections in the Western Ratepayers' Annual Meeting, regardless of the outcome, do not determine the ultimate fate of the International Settlement. In other words: Assuming that the results of this election are entirely as they were in the past, the most powerful and best guarantee for the long-term maintenance of the International Settlement in its original state, as well as for its underlying foundation and fate, lies in the respect for international treaties and the clarification of the international environment after China's victory in the War of Resistance. Assuming that the results of this election favor Japan, and the Municipal Council is dominated by Japanese directors, and control of the Settlement falls into the hands of the Japanese, then the duration of this abnormal state will not depend on the competition in subsequent elections, but on the outcome of the Sino-Japanese War. In addition, it must also be recognized that the Western Ratepayers' Annual Meeting is not enough to determine the final fate of the International Settlement, and the ebb and flow of the positions of various countries within the International Settlement cannot affect the victory or defeat of the Sino-Japanese War; not just the ebb and flow, even the gains and losses of the entire Shanghai are not enough to determine the overall victory or defeat of the war.</p>
<p>This is a clear and unchangeable truth, and the fundamental key to the future of the Shanghai International Settlement. Explaining this key is by no means to say that the expatriate taxpayers of various countries should passively allow this election to unfold, or to simply watch the natural evolution during the period of preparation before the election. We hope that the expatriates of various countries recognize the key, and realize that they are not without skin-deep pain, without direct self-interest in the Sino-Japanese War, and should not simply stand by as bystanders. We especially hope that the expatriates of various countries, including Japan, recognize the key, and understand that if the Shanghai Municipal Council undergoes changes due to the election, with hasty actions and alterations, it will not benefit any aspect of the overall situation. In short, Shanghai's "nature" is determined by international treaties and the international environment, but Shanghai does not become a factor in determining international treaties and the international environment.</p>
<h3 id="e12">The Fifth Session of the National Political Council: Chairman Chiang's Opening Address <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>Chongqing (Continued from yesterday) Initially, he adopted a tough and fierce stance to intimidate the United States, but the United States remained unmoved. Then, he turned around and used compensation for losses and respect for its rights and interests in China to entice the United States, but the United States remained unmoved. The U.S.-Japan Commercial Treaty was finally abolished, and the moral embargo was implemented step by step. Now, his envoys are going everywhere, and he is also making a gesture of uniting Central and South American countries to encircle the United States to threaten the United States. However, has the United States ever been threatened by him in the slightest? The public opinion and determination of U.S. sanctions have only become stronger due to extra pain and anger. Frankly speaking, after our three years of resistance, the exhaustion and emptiness of the Japanese's strength is known to the world. No country is unaware of this. Yet, to this day, they still boast and deceive the world. This is completely selling short and buying long, and it shows their extreme foolishness. These two examples alone show that their diplomacy, as I said two years ago, is fundamentally wrong, and the branches and leaves are useless. Of course, they will run into walls everywhere and have no choice but to reach a dead end. Precisely because the Japanese are in a dead end in all aspects, internally and externally, in military affairs, politics, economy, and diplomacy, they finally called on Wang Jingwei to succeed Wang Kemin and Liang Hongzhi after hesitating and looking back. Afterwards, they organized a puppet government in Nanjing, which made its debut on March 30th. However, how can this kind of organization have the slightest impact on our country's resistance? I have long said that (no matter how many puppet organizations the Japanese create, no matter what name these puppet organizations use, they will never have the slightest effect internally or externally, nor can they harm our party and country in the slightest. The Japanese's move is nothing more than wanting to use a set of illusions to deceive the international community and their own people, and to use this to cover up their failure and make a reluctant explanation. The reason why they want to impersonate the Kuomintang and the National Government in everything and make their debut is to use this as a realization of the (Japan-Japan Secret Agreement) and the (establishment of a New Order in East Asia). That is to say, with the establishment of the (New Central Regime), the (New Order in East Asia) and the (adjustment of the new Sino-Japanese relationship) illusions of destroying China have also been realized at the same time. Frankly speaking, the emergence of the puppet organization is Japan's declaration of its last stand. From the Japanese domestic perspective, instigating Wang's debut means that they have exhausted all their strength and cannot conquer China. It also means that they know they cannot save this crisis of invading China, so they want to cast a final adventure in order to use (a fait accompli) to hold their national public opinion hostage, so that their people will pay more taxes to supply their driving. In fact, the anti-war wave in his country will only increase day by day because of this. The Japanese's move is tantamount to admitting their failure to their own people, and the result will inevitably arouse greater resentment and the greatest awakening among their own people. As for the international impact, it is tantamount to officially telling the world that his ambition is to do or die, and he is determined to destroy China, drive out the great powers, monopolize East Asia, and then dominate the world. The tricks he used in Korea and Siberia in the past, he now wants to use again in China. Who can still believe him? Who can let him go? Therefore, the performance of the puppet organization is Japan's last chess piece, and it is also the most important chess piece to accelerate Japan's collapse. I often say that (the Japanese zaibatsu will only do things that are harmful to their own country and will never do anything that is beneficial to their own country. The emergence of the puppet organization is another powerful proof. On our side, precisely because the Japanese zaibatsu have reached a dead end, we must work harder to resist the war. We have established a second three-year plan for the War of Resistance. This second three-year plan for the War of Resistance is also an active plan for national construction. Therefore, we must work harder and take joint responsibility to intensify and enrich our political, economic, and military strength. We must also know that the reason why the Japanese zaibatsu have reached the end of their rope today is because we have been united, working hard, not afraid of difficulties, and not afraid of sacrifice in the past two years and nine months, which has finally caused them to decline and fail completely. Now that the Japanese zaibatsu have brought out Wang, the eyes of the whole world are on our 450 million compatriots. U.S. Secretary of State Hull's statement on March 31 is the representative of international justice and world public opinion. However, they all want to see how our Chinese nation will deal with the Japanese who created this puppet show. At this time, we should do our best and use the revolutionary spirit of our heroes and heroines to resist the war to wash away this great shame. To put it more specifically, the Japanese puppets want to use the conspiracy to completely destroy our country and nation to advocate their so-called (restoration of peace) in the hope of saving their fate. We must use all our strength to actively attack and counterattack, and vow to drive the Japanese army out of our country's borders to create a real and permanent peace in East Asia. (The Japanese puppets want to use the Japan-Japan Secret Agreement) to perform their so-called (adjustment of national relations) trick, and want to annex our China through this. We must completely eliminate the Japanese to win back our national independence, survival, and freedom. The Japanese puppets collude to sing their so-called (joint construction of a new order in East Asia). We must exert the power of the entire nation and use facts to shatter Japan's ambition to dominate East Asia. Until Japan finally fails, our War of Resistance will never stop. We must restore the integrity of our country's territory, sovereignty, and administration. We must restore the dignity of the Nine-Power Treaty and other international treaties. For the world and for East Asia, we must carry forward the glory of our Three People's Principles. This is the determination we should have today, and it is also the natural duty we should fulfill to establish world peace. Therefore, in the future, we must not slack off because the Japanese are exhausted, nor can we be scattered because the Japanese cannot attack. Our victory is definitely within our grasp, but it must be realized through our continuous efforts and continuous struggle. Only when the Japanese are more exhausted should we become more invigorated. The closer the Japanese are to decline, the more we should strive to become stronger. Since the beginning of the War of Resistance, we have decided to resist the war and build the country at the same time. Resistance is our current urgent task, and national construction is our ultimate goal. Now, no matter how the international situation changes, it is beneficial to our War of Resistance. The Japanese's self-destruction is even more beneficial to our national construction. The foundation of our final victory is therefore even stronger. Therefore, at this time, from the perspective of the situation, it is precisely the time for us to concentrate on resisting the war. From the perspective of responsibility, it is even more the time for us to actively struggle to build the country. We must not only work hard in the military, but also work hard in all aspects of political and economic construction at the same time. Why do we want to promote local autonomy and enrich grassroots politics? Why do we want to vigorously carry out economic construction and develop the southwest and northwest? Why do we want to decide to convene a National Assembly, promulgate a constitution, and establish a foundation for democracy? And why do we want the whole country to respect the country's systems and laws, strictly abide by discipline, and follow the program for resisting the war and building the country? It is to enhance the strength of the War of Resistance, and it is also to complete the great cause of national construction. We would like to inform all members of our National Political Council that at the beginning of the War of Resistance, it could be said that the military decided everything. However, today, after two years and nine months of the War of Resistance, the foundation for military victory has been laid. If we want to complete the mission of the War of Resistance and achieve final victory in the future, it will not only depend on military victory or defeat, but also on how the political and economic construction work will determine the future of our War of Resistance. Therefore, from today onwards, our colleagues should concentrate and enrich both the spiritual and material aspects from an active perspective, so that all aspects of political, economic, and social construction can develop rapidly. The establishment of our National Political Council has been nearly two years now. Although the National Political Council has a statutory term, the responsibility of our colleagues to save the country and build the country is endless. Rather than saying that the mission of the National Political Council in the past two years has been fulfilled, it is better to say that our work with heavy responsibilities and far-reaching goals has only truly begun today. During this conference, I hope that everyone will express their sincerity and contribute their abilities. First of all, fully review and provide opinions on the central items of the administrative facilities reported by this seat in order to promote the rapid development of our local autonomy and economic construction. At the same time, please pay attention to the following three points: First, the Program for Resisting the War and Building the Country, which we promulgated two years ago and was resolved by this conference, is the creed that our entire country unanimously abides by. Our colleagues should, based on this common creed, openly and honestly review the achievements we have made in the past, whether for the government, for the local area, for society, or even for various groups and individuals, to see if they have faithfully fulfilled this program, and use our enthusiasm and public opinion to urge the realization of this program. Second, the Sichuan-Kang Construction Promotion Association is an important work of this association that has made practical contributions to the country. The implementation of the Sichuan-Kang construction plan and the achievements made by the Promotion Association should be carefully examined and accelerated to complete the construction of our important base for the War of Resistance as a demonstration for all construction. Third, there should be a detailed discussion on the establishment of a constitutional foundation and make practical contributions. We should not only focus on constitution-making, but also pay special attention to constitutionalism. We do not seek the beauty of the clauses, but the feasibility of this law, so that its implementation is beneficial to the War of Resistance and even more beneficial to the long-term plan of the country. Our founding father, Mr. Sun Yat-sen, began to write a ten-year national defense plan in the tenth year of the Republic of China, with more than 60 sections from beginning to end, and even stipulated the catalog. Among them, the sixth section is (National Defense and the Constitution). This work was unfortunately not written successfully, but the intention of our founding father can arouse our deep thinking. When we discuss the formulation of the Constitution of the Republic of China, we should not only abide by the legacy of the five-power system, but also take into account national defense, because without sound national defense, there is no foundation for constitutionalism and nation-building. Therefore, our constitution today must pay more attention to national defense in order to become a long-term and stable code. Everyone, for two years and nine months, the united struggle of the whole country and the heroic sacrifices of the soldiers and civilians have finally laid the foundation for our victory. This foundation must be cherished and consolidated by everyone. This conference is held at a time when the Japanese puppets are rampaging and struggling. We must encourage the people to work harder from today onwards and give the Japanese puppets a strong blow. Do not let the favorable situation be easily missed, so as not to lose all our efforts. I hope that everyone will carry forward our consistent spirit of loyalty and dedication, assist the government, lead the society, enrich the national strength, and concentrate all will and strength, so that our political and military affairs will make greater progress, economic construction will make greater progress, and the foundation of victory will be more solid, so as to fulfill our responsibility to the entire nation and achieve the historical mission of resisting the war and building the country.

Premier Reynaud Grants a Long Meeting to Gu Weijun. <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>London: British officials announced last night that the UK maintained a cool attitude towards the "New Nanjing Government" led by Wang Jingwei. Officials solemnly stated that the UK recognized the only Chinese government, namely the National Government in Chongqing. Officials expressed dismay at the news from Washington that Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, British Ambassador to Japan, gave a speech in Tokyo last Thursday, which was regarded as a change in British policy in the Far East. (Associated Press, 2nd)</p>
<p>London: After the establishment of the "Wang Jingwei New Government," the British side did not express opposition like the United States. According to political figures, there are two reasons for this: (1) Britain has matters in Europe and has no time to take care of other matters. (2) Britain's position in the Far East is more difficult than that of the United States. However, Britain has long stated that the Chinese National Government is the only legitimate government recognized by Britain. Therefore, the British government believes that there is no need to make a statement again at present. According to well-informed sources, the British Ambassador to China will of course continue to target the National Government. At the same time, the British government will closely monitor the development of the situation, including how the "Zhu Jingwei Government" will promote its power in the occupied areas, the attitude of the Chinese people towards the "Zai Government," and whether the actions of Zhu Jingwei are based on the breath of the Japanese government and the Japanese authorities in China. In short, Britain has important interests in China. For this reason, British officials may carefully interact with the local authorities in the occupied areas of China. (Havas, 2nd)</p>
<p>Paris: French Premier Reynaud met with Gu Weijun, the Chinese Ambassador to Paris, yesterday. It is believed that they discussed France's Far Eastern policy. Reynaud decided to adopt the same policy as Washington and not recognize the "Wang Jingwei New Government" of the "Nanjing Kuomintang." It is said that when U.S. Undersecretary of State Welles visited Paris last month, President Reynaud had assured Welles that France would not recognize the establishment of the "Nanjing Government." The statement issued by Tokyo that as long as General Chiang Kai-shek continues to resist, the Japanese army will not withdraw from China for a day, so the Japanese army on Hainan Island has no hope of withdrawing early. This statement further reduces the possibility of France recognizing the "New Government." (Associated Press, 2nd)</p>
<p>Tokyo: "Asahi Shimbun" commented on U.S. Secretary of State Hull's recent remarks reaffirming the U.S.'s non-recognition principle for the "new regime" in Nanjing and reviewed the attitudes of various countries towards the "new regime." It said that the entire Japanese nation was aware of the U.S. attitude as expressed in Hull's remarks and had no new impression. The newspaper paid attention to the comparison of the attitudes of Britain and the United States, because the British government has always been silent on China's "new regime" and has not made any official observations. The newspaper expects that there will be no sudden change in British policy, but it believes that a subtle British attitude can be found in the speech of British Ambassador to Japan Sir Archibald Clark Kerr on March 28, the speech of British Secretary of the Navy Churchill on March 30, and the editorial of the "Times" in London on the same day. On the other hand, the newspaper predicted that there will be a new trend in France. The editorial of "Paris Times" on March 30 strongly stated the future importance of China's "new regime" and called attention to Japan's welcome to third countries to participate in China's economic development.

<p>San Pedro: One hundred and thirty U.S. warships sailed out of San Diego Harbor at midnight yesterday to conduct the largest-scale exercise of the U.S. fleet in the Pacific. The fleet exercise plan is extremely secret. Eleven long warships, accompanied by a large number of heavy cruisers and destroyers, after sailing away from San Diego Harbor, will meet with a fleet of light cruisers, destroyers, and submarines in "a certain place in the Pacific" to conduct exercises. The sailing procedure is led by minesweepers, and destroyers protect the dreadnoughts as they advance. The fleet is divided into "Black" and "White" fleets for preliminary exercises when sailing to Hawaii. After the fleet stays in Hawaii for five days to refuel and water, it will begin to conduct exercises to protect the United States from "imaginary" enemies. This year's exercise contains extreme importance due to the tense relations between Japan and the United States and the European War. The U.S. Navy will utilize the lessons learned from the wartime operations of the Allied and German fleets obtained from Europe and implement them in this major exercise. The western shift area of this exercise will be farther than any other exercise. Secretary of the Navy Edison, who is sailing west with the fleet, will inspect the fortifications in Hawaii. When the long fleet leaves Hawaii, it will be divided into "Brown Red" and "Purple" teams to engage in large-scale exercises (Associated Press, 2nd)</p>

Mass stated that the purpose of the exercise is to protect the United States and other countries in the Western Hemisphere, and the Panama Canal is particularly important. "Although the U.S. Navy is far in the Pacific, its most important purpose is no different from the exercise held in the Caribbean Islands last year. Japan has no reason to be unhappy.

<p>Tokyo: Japanese expert on international affairs Shimizu declared yesterday that the future actions of Britain and the United States in the Far East depend on Japan's policy, so Japan's policy of "flattering Britain and the United States" is not timely. Shimizu published an article in "Hochi Shimbun" stating that the Soviet Union's line will be the determining factor guiding British and American policy. He stated, "I believe that Britain and the United States will hinder the Soviet Union's actions in the Far East, but Japan can guide the Soviet Union's actions, so it can cause Britain and the United States to leave the Far East." Shimizu claimed that Japan's current policy has led to the collusion of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union on the China issue and has caused opposition to Japan. If this continues, Japan will have to fight the three countries in the future. However, if Japan can shift the Soviet Union's gaze to the West, then Britain and the United States will also yearn for it. If the Soviet Union's gaze shifts to the East, then Britain and the United States will follow suit to the East. From this point of view, Japan holds the key to shifting the gaze of the three countries to any side. Therefore, we express our opposition to the policy of Foreign Minister Arita Hachiro.

<h3 id="e26">Chamberlain's Announcement in the House of Commons: Britain and France Extend the Scope of Their Joint Declaration, Stipulating Long-Term Cooperation in Multiple Areas, Aiming to Rebuild International Order <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>London – Prime Minister Chamberlain announced in the House of Commons today that the British and French governments, in a solemn declaration of the Allied Supreme Military Council, have expressed their intention to extend their cooperation to all aspects relating to the interests and security of both countries. After reading the original text of the declaration, the Prime Minister continued, "If this declaration only concerned the conduct of the war, then given the complete unity of purpose already existing between the two countries, some might criticize it as unnecessary. However, its content not only expresses the determination of Britain and France to fight side by side for a common victory, but also stipulates the continued cooperation of the two countries to build peace and to rebuild an international order to safeguard the freedom of the people, respect the law, and maintain peace in Europe."</p>
<p>The Declaration Has Two Distinctive Characteristics</p>
<p>The declaration has two notable characteristics: (1) No peace proposal, regardless of its origin, will even be discussed until Britain and France have reached complete agreement on what constitutes a genuine peace that guarantees the security of themselves and other free nations in Europe. (Cheers) (2) After the conclusion of the peace, while welcoming other countries to assist in the reconstruction of Europe, the unity of British and French action will be maintained in all aspects, for as long as is necessary to achieve and consolidate this reconstruction. (Cheers) I would now like to say a word about our ally Poland. We have a commitment to them that there will be no negotiation of peace without their consent. Several divisions of Polish troops have now been formed in France, and Polish air force personnel are currently undergoing training in France. We are confident that these forces will achieve good results in the common struggle in which we are currently engaged. The Prime Minister then referred back to the Supreme Military Council, saying that the current situation presented to the Allies is Germany's wanton misinterpretation of its obligations to neutral countries, and its statement that neutral countries will suffer tragic consequences if they do not comply with Germany's demands, thus intimidating the neutral countries. The double standard of neutrality proposed by Germany is what we and the neutral countries must now deal with. The policy of the Allies is to strive to respect the rights of neutral countries, while Germany, whenever its actions suit its policy, does not hesitate to destroy the property of neutral countries and kill their people. The Supreme Military Council reviewed the military developments since the last meeting and made various important decisions regarding the future actions of the Allies. The content of these decisions is not yet ready for publication, but I dare say that the House will have no difficulty in inferring the general nature and direction of the harmonious discussions. At the same time, the result of this meeting, and its manifestation before the public, is the solemn declaration jointly drafted by the two governments. In recent months, the cooperation and unity of purpose between Britain and France have become increasingly close.</p>
<p>Britain and France Jointly Discuss Close Economic Cooperation</p>
<p>The Prime Minister continued, "I have already mentioned in the House the financial agreement concluded between Britain and France in December last year. Since the establishment of that agreement, we have expanded cooperation to all commercial issues and the supply of munitions. Just recently, the British Colonial Secretary met with French ministers in Paris to jointly agree on a plan for the closest cooperation."</p>
<p>Efforts in Economic Warfare Have Achieved Great Success</p>
<p>The Allies have resolved to engage in economic warfare with all their might, and have already achieved great success. Britain has successfully completed trade negotiations for the war with Norway, Sweden, Iceland, Belgium, and the Netherlands. The Anglo-Danish agreement was also signed at the Foreign Office this afternoon. In addition, the Allies have concluded important commercial agreements with Spain, Greece, and Turkey. We deeply welcome the Deputy Governor of the National Bank of Yugoslavia, who is currently in London for economic and financial discussions. It is expected that a delegation from Romania will also arrive here soon to discuss revising the current payment agreement. We are now looking forward to the arrival in Britain of the French Minister of Blockade, Monnet.</p>
<p>Mourning the Recent Passing of Two Major Government Officials</p>
<p>The Prime Minister then expressed his condolences for the recent passing of Minister of Shipping Gilmore and New Zealand Prime Minister Savage, saying that Britain and the Empire deeply regret the passing of these two statesmen, who were loyal and dedicated to completing the responsibility of victory. The Prime Minister concluded by saying that the report on the sinking of the submarine "Thetis" will be released on Thursday. (Reuters, 2nd)</p>
<h3 id="e27">British Announcement of Naval Warfare Losses <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>London – According to authorities, the number of ships lost due to enemy action in the week ending Sunday midnight was one British oil tanker and three neutral ships, totaling 13,101 tons. This is the least amount of loss in a week this year, and the fourth least since the outbreak of war. When the loss of two British ships was announced last week, it was initially thought that the week could be a record-breaking one. However, it has since been announced that the British ship "Ben Hill" (5,439 tons) caught fire from a bomb, and it is now recognized that the ship has been completely lost. Therefore, the result was not as satisfactory as initially thought. The losses of last week were only about one-third of the average weekly loss in the thirty weeks since the beginning of the war, and one-tenth of the average weekly loss in the thirty weeks of 1937 when German submarines were rampant to the extreme. The British ship sunk last week was the oil tanker "Dastan Early" (5,742 tons), which was sunk by a bomb off the northeast coast of Scotland. The captain died in the line of duty, three sailors are missing, and the rest were rescued. Of the four neutral ships, one was a 2,902-ton Dutch ship, which was listed in the loss list for the week ending Sunday midnight, but was actually lost in the previous week and was not included in that week's loss list. According to authorities, last week a British warship intercepted a German ship in the northern seas, namely the "Mizhi Jiao" carrying 4,000 tons. The sailors scuttled the ship and set it on fire, and all the sailors were rescued. This is the twenty-eighth German ship scuttled. (Reuters, 2nd)</p>
<h3 id="e28">Britain and France Temporarily Do Not Implement a Blockade of Norwegian Territorial Waters; Various Measures Still Under Study <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>London – The joint meeting of the Supreme Defense Committee of Britain and France decided to temporarily not intensify the blockade of the territorial waters of the Scandinavian countries. This matter is purely due to diplomatic motives and should not be extended for too long. As for the Black Sea, the blockade measures will also not be implemented for the time being. Everything depends on whether Germany can obtain significant assistance from the Soviet Union. Diplomatic circles say that although the speeches made by Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov the other day and the tone of Soviet newspapers were very strong, in reality the country is eager to avoid open confrontation with Britain and France, not only militarily, but also economically. According to Soviet sources, the country is willing to reach an agreement with Britain to formally provide assurances that it will no longer supply Germany with goods imported from abroad, similar to the assurances provided by Belgium, Greece, and Turkey. The fact that the Soviet Union maintains its current relationship with Britain and France can also be seen in this. In short, the attitude of Britain and France depends entirely on the commercial relationship between Germany and the Soviet Union, and before taking a decision, the promises provided by the Soviet Union should be carefully considered and not easily believed. As for the Soviet ships previously captured, there are no plans to release them for the time being, and they should still be intercepted when necessary. (Havas, 1st)</p>
<p>London – Norwegian sources here recently defended the "fair and neutral attitude adopted by the Norwegian government," stating that although the Norwegian government allows Swedish iron ore to be exported through the Norwegian port of Narvik, this is beneficial to both Britain and Germany and does not favor one side over the other. In practice, more Swedish iron ore is shipped to Britain than to Germany. Moreover, when necessary, nine-tenths of the Swedish iron ore can be shipped directly from the Swedish port of Luleå on the Baltic coast to Germany, without having to pass through Norway. British diplomatic sources said that the issue of intensifying the blockade in Scandinavia has been temporarily shelved. Britain and France have held talks with the Scandinavian countries to discuss the measures they intend to implement. These measures still need to be studied in detail and cannot be implemented for the time being. However, this does not mean that Britain and France will allow Germany to continue to use the territorial waters of neutral countries for a long time. (Havas, 1st)</p>

<p>London – Dr. Perin, Vice Governor of the National Bank of Yugoslavia, who is leading the Yugoslav business delegation, arrived here today and immediately held preliminary talks with Sir Leeds Ross, the British government's economic advisor, and informed Britain of the Yugoslav government's views on the blockade policy of Britain and France, explaining that the country has recently experienced great difficulties in importing various raw materials, and hopes to obtain convenience in terms of exchange rates. Well-informed sources said that since both Britain and Yugoslavia want to increase the volume of trade, it will not be difficult to reach a satisfactory agreement. In addition, Romanian business representatives will also come here in the near future. Foreign Minister Halifax recently summoned British envoys stationed in various Balkan countries to return home to report on their duties and hold talks with them. The British envoy to Romania is also among them, which will be of great benefit to future British-Romanian business negotiations. (Havas, 1st)</p>

<p>London – The Times correspondent in Dubrovnik, Yugoslavia, reported that the German ship "Angara" has arrived in Thessaloniki to load iron bauxite to return home. Another 26 Yugoslav ships are also expected to sail from Trieste, Italy, to Thessaloniki in the near future. According to reliable sources, these ships are preparing to load 50,000 tons of iron bauxite from Yugoslavia and sail back to Germany, trying to navigate within Yugoslav territorial waters to avoid interception by British and French warships. In addition, the owner of the "Angara" said that two more ships belonging to the German Eastern Shipping Company are currently in Istanbul, Turkey, and will soon sail through the Black Sea to Constanta, Romania.

<h3 id="e33">Rumors of Soviet-German Plot to Conduct Anti-American Propaganda Targeting Roosevelt <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>Washington – A spokesperson for a female senator in the Senate said today that the U.S. government has obtained irrefutable evidence proving that the Soviet Union and Germany are currently jointly engaged in a propaganda campaign to attack Roosevelt's handling of international affairs both in the U.S. and abroad. The release of the White Paper is one step in a planned effort to weaken Roosevelt's power. The joint Soviet-German plan includes two approaches: First, the Soviet and German officials jointly established a propaganda organization, using it to prove that the Roosevelt government is trying to get the United States to join the Allied side of the war, thereby increasing the strength of attacks on Roosevelt. Second, the Soviet Union and Germany instructed their parties in the United States to launch anti-Roosevelt propaganda from within the United States. The evidence obtained by the government showed that the second plan was already underway, including the defamation of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, claiming it to be the American secret police under the control of Roosevelt. The spokesperson also said that Moscow had ordered all its groups and organizations in the U.S. to submit numerous "protests against the infringement of civil liberties and constitutional rights" to the U.S. Congress and the American news media.

<p>Oslo – Norwegian Foreign Minister Gutt yesterday gave an interview to a Reuters reporter, elaborating on Norway's neutral stance. Gutt referred to British Naval Minister Churchill's speech on the 6th, saying that Churchill had not made any remarks that could be seen as endangering Norway's neutrality or threatening Norway to abandon its neutrality, which he happily welcomed. He went on to say that Norway was in danger of being blockaded in the war, saying that when its closest neighbors overseas were at war, Norway always felt at risk, but Norway did not have to enter the war because of this. He believed that Norway's staying out of the war was beneficial to all parties. Gutt also mentioned that British public opinion seemed to think that Norway's protests against German violations of its neutrality were less severe than its protests against Britain. He said that Norway protested against various different violations in an appropriate manner. The damage inflicted on Norway by Germany, in terms of people and materials, was what Norway was very angry about. Norway would do its best to stop it, while Britain's actions that harmed Norway's neutrality were of a different nature, because what Britain did mostly involved Norway's honor and independence, and also involved Norway's material interests. Small countries also have their points of honor that they have to defend. Gutt went on to say that Norway had not been forced to supply raw materials to any country. The basic points of the British-Norwegian commercial agreement were that Norway should maintain its normal exports to all countries, including Germany. Except for what the British government relied on, Norway had never supplied Germany with other raw materials. (Reuter, 2nd)</p>

<p>Washington – During the Senate's debate on the German propaganda campaign today, Democratic Senator Reynolds, a staunch isolationist, rose to speak, requesting that Ambassador to France Bullitt appear before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to explain whether the documents related to the United States included in the German White Paper are true. At the same time, he also requested that Undersecretary of State Welles appear before the committee to report on his conversations with authorities from various countries during his recent trip to Europe, and strongly argued that the United States should not engage in secret diplomacy. Since the German White Paper contains many slanders against the United States, the Senate must conduct an investigation to uncover the truth. (Note: When the Senate previously discussed the Neutrality Act Amendment, i.e., the repeal of the embargo clause, Reynolds strongly opposed it and launched the "Beware of Joining the War" slogan to promote the isolationist movement.) On the other hand, Democratic Senator Burns cited German leader Hitler's confession in his book "Mein Kampf," that "We must blame the war on the enemy, even if it does not conform to the facts," to prove that the White Paper published by Germany must be a forgery.

<p>New York – Since the outbreak of the European War, the demand for crude oil in various countries has increased sharply. "World Oil" magazine recently released official statistics stating that the total amount of crude oil produced worldwide in 1939 was 2,076,852,295 barrels, an increase of 55% compared to 1938. Among them, the production in December of last year was the highest, with a total of 186,088,218 barrels, an increase of 1,235,351 barrels compared to November, and an increase of 17,851,670 barrels compared to December 1938. In addition, the countries with the highest crude oil production last year were the United States, with 1,266,517,500 barrels, accounting for 60.9% of the world's total crude oil production, with a total export volume of 53 million barrels, which was higher than in 1938, but a decrease of 12,600,000 barrels compared to 1937. The Soviet Union ranked second with 216,727,000 barrels, an increase of 10,535,000 barrels compared to 1938. Venezuela ranked third with 205,956,000 barrels, an increase of 3,000,000 barrels compared to 1938. As for the crude oil production of Egypt and Hejaz, it was not noticed two years ago, but it greatly increased last year. Egypt produced 4,415,000 barrels, an increase of 2,854,000 barrels compared to 1938. Hejaz produced 2,855,000 barrels, an increase of 3,360,000 barrels compared to 1938. In addition, Romania is now the center for the supply of crude oil to the various European belligerent countries. Last year, it only produced 45,996,000 barrels, a decrease of 2,370,000 barrels compared to 1938, which is a phenomenon that has not been seen in many years. Poland produced 3,898,000 barrels last year, an increase of 70,000 barrels compared to 1938. Germany, including the provinces of Austria and Slovakia and Moravia, produced a total of 5,300,000 barrels last year, which only reached a weak percentage of Germany's regular needs.

<h3 id="e40">New York Foreign Exchange Market: The Pound Sterling Trends Lower to Preserve Foreign Exchange Resources Without Harming the Reputation of British Currency <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>London – The city reporter of The Times commented on the recent decline of the pound sterling in the "free" exchange rate in New York, refuting the foreign claims that this decline would damage the reputation of the pound sterling, saying that the decline proves that our measures to preserve foreign exchange resources are becoming more effective. Such seemingly paradoxical rumors are easy to explain. The reporter made the following explanations: (1) The free market is often very narrow, so it is easy to have large fluctuations up and down. (2) The authorities have recently been preventing the use of gold pounds purchased in the free market to pay for the value of certain goods exported from the British Empire. These exports must now be paid for with foreign currency permitted by the authorities or with pounds sterling purchased in the official market in London. The purpose of this measure is to prevent the consumption of income from British exports through the free market, so that it can be used to pay for the value of various major imports needed by Britain. This is mainly to compensate for the withdrawal of foreign capital deposited in London. This measure is sufficient to preserve our foreign exchange resources and reduce the demand for the pound sterling in the free market. The decline in the price of the "free" pound sterling is a natural consequence, which is clear proof that our measures to preserve foreign exchange resources and transfer them to the official market are becoming more effective.

<h3 id="e47">The First Charity Basketball Game: Qianghua Defeated Huqing Yesterday, Leading All the Way to a Final Score of 46 to 36; The Second Game Will Still Be Held at the Same Venue Tomorrow Night <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>Huqing and Qianghua, the basketball champions of the Chinese Youth and Western Youth teams, are playing a best-of-three charity game, hosted by the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association. The game was held in the Chinese Youth basketball hall last night. As a result, Qianghua led all the way and won with a score of 46 to 36. The halftime score was 22 to 16. The second game is scheduled to be held at the same venue tomorrow night. Although there was drizzling rain last night, the audience was very enthusiastic and packed the hall. It shows that everyone is eager to do good and help others. The competition was also quite exciting and received full applause.</p>
<p>Wonderful Shots Repeatedly Seen</p>
<p>The Huqing team came late, and it was not until 7:45 that Mr. Yuan Ludeng of the Refugee Association gave a speech and the game began. Mr. Lin Kanghou threw the opening ball. The two teams made contact, and Sun Hupei opened the scoring first. Zhang Wenqing tied the score with one throw, 2 to 2. After 4 to 4, Qianghua stood out. Xianglong and Youkui scored five consecutive points, making it 9 to 4. Although Huqing also added three points, Nianhua made wonderful shots and A'kui added icing on the cake. Qianghua led with 17 to 11, 19 to 14. At halftime, the score was 22 to 16, with Qianghua leading by six points.</p>
<p>Leading Step by Step</p>
<p>At the start of the second half, Qianghua veteran Lu Zhongen came on the court. Qianghua continued to lead step by step. The score became 30 to 20. Li Zude and Chen Bangzhen came on again, but Huqing still had difficulty developing. Xianglong and Nianhua were active throughout the court. The largest score difference was 40 to 24, a difference of 16 points. Although Li Zude and Sun Hupei scored some points, the three musketeers of Qianghua, Xianglong, A'kui, and Nianhua, continued to score. As a result, Qianghua won by ten points, 46 to 36.</p>
<p>Winning Through Cooperation</p>
<p>Qianghua's victory last night was entirely due to cooperation. Their coordinated tactics were more skilled than Huqing's. Huqing's individual techniques were excellent, but on the court last night, they seemed like they were meeting for the first time. In terms of shooting, Huqing was not as good at close-range and long-range shots either. It is heard that this game was originally for the championship teams of the Chinese and Western Youth leagues, but Huqing invited Wang Nanhua to participate as an assistant. Therefore, Qianghua also plans to invite two more famous players to participate tomorrow night, but the list will be kept secret for strategic reasons.</p>

<h3 id="e51">Financial Situation Gradually Calming Down, Foreign Exchange Forward Contracts Lengthen <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>The foreign exchange market yesterday saw the HSBC listed rates unchanged. The off-market sentiment for British and American exchange rates was calm, with minimal fluctuations, a situation unseen for a long time. In the early morning, due to the continued rise of the US-UK exchange rate by 2.5 points, the US exchange rate opened at a loose 0.0625, while the sterling rate remained unchanged. For a short time, the US exchange rate was offered at 6.09375 for buying, but there was little market activity. Later, speculators took advantage of the low prices to absorb, and foreign firms settled their accounts, all coming at once. However, the actions of Japanese firms were slightly different, focusing on selling sterling and buying US dollars, causing the price to gradually tighten. The price of 6.0625 was difficult to settle. Futures contracts softened, although spot prices returned to parity after the entry.  Futures contracts remained attractive. In the afternoon, speculators entered the market seeking to sell, and the market re-hardened, reaching a price of 6.0975. Futures contracts also lengthened. At the close, the spot US dollar exchange rate was 6.0625, and the British gold rate was unchanged (combined US-UK exchange rate of 2.5275). As a result, the British rate was flat and the US rate hardened by 0.0625 compared to the previous day. The potential for futures contracts differed slightly from the spot market.</p>
<p>Japanese Firms Sell Sterling Gold and Buy US Dollars</p>
<p>In the early morning, the London rate was close to flat, shrinking by 0.0625. The New York silver price remained flat, the London spot gold price remained unchanged, and the exchange rates for sterling against the US dollar, Shanghai, and France were all flat. The US dollar rate against sterling was up by 2.5 points, against Shanghai by 5 points, and against France by 1.5 points. The central bank's listed rates for all currencies remained the same. At the morning opening, the bank's spot selling prices were 4 pence 125 for British gold and 6.0625 for the US dollar, flat for British gold and hardened for the US dollar by 0.0625 compared to the previous close, due to the increase in exchange rates. After opening, foreign firms had intentions to sell, and the market was slightly hard. At that time, the spot US dollar exchange rate of 6.09375 could be settled. Then, speculators suddenly came to absorb, and the rate immediately returned to parity. It is calculated that speculators and a certain foreign firm mutually absorbed the HSBC, Huayi, and American banks' US dollar contracts for this month at 5.90625 and for next month at 5.6875. The HSBC listed rates were announced and remained unchanged. The white silver balance tax was announced and did not increase or decrease. After that, Japanese firms sold sterling and bought US dollars. At the same time, speculators continued to absorb slightly, and the foreign firms also slightly settled accounts, and the market slightly softened. It is calculated that Japanese firms sold sterling gold to Yuli for May at 3 pence 9375, and absorbed US dollar contracts from a certain bank for this month at 5.875 and for May at 5.6875. At that time, foreign firms also absorbed the spot US dollar exchange rate from foreign firms at 6.0625 and sterling gold for this month at 4 pence. At that time, the spot US dollar exchange rate of 6.0625 was difficult to settle, but soon the supply intention of foreign firms increased, and the number of buyers gradually decreased, so it returned to parity. Until the close of the market, the British gold rate was 4 pence 125 and the US dollar exchange rate was 6.0625, with no changes from the morning opening. However, the forward central US dollar exchange rate softened slightly.</p>
<p>Speculative Bulls Have Already Started Selling</p>
<p>After the market opened, the spot and futures rates remained the same as the afternoon close, but soon a few speculative bulls suddenly sold out, and the futures market hardened. It is calculated that this month's US dollar contract was sold to a foreign firm at 5.9375, and foreign firms mutually traded this month's sterling gold at 4 pence 03125, and foreign firms also mutually traded May's US dollar contract at 5.78125. At that time, the spot US dollar exchange rate was offered at 6.09375, but it was difficult to settle. Extended to the close, British gold was at 4 pence 125, the US dollar exchange rate was at 6.0625, this month's sterling gold was at 4 pence 03125, and the US dollar was at 5.90625, next month's sterling gold was at 3 pence 921875, and the US dollar was at 5.75. As a result, compared to the previous day, the spot British gold was flat, and the US dollar increased by 0.0625, this month's British gold hardened by 0.015625, and the US dollar cheapened by 0.0625, next month's British gold was flat, and the US dollar loosened by 0.09375.</p>

<h3 id="e52">Bulls Still Trying to Struggle, Gold Market Recovers Slightly <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cash gold market was bleak, and the market situation was chaotic, presenting a spinning situation all day long. In the early morning, due to the rise in British and American exchange rates, the US dollar softened, but the gold market was not affected in any way. People's minds were still in an atmosphere of expecting prices to rise, so the opening only fell slightly by five yuan, and then immediately rose sharply by thirty yuan, reaching a peak of 5,580 yuan, because the securities firms absorbed, arousing buyers. Unfortunately, the securities firms suddenly rose up and sold out, and the selling voices were loud, and the price could not be supported and was pressed down to 5,510 yuan. However, it was firm again at noon. In the afternoon, the buying intention of the silver firms and others was strong, so it once rose to 5,575 yuan. Who knew that after this, the selling wind was excited, and the 5,500 yuan mark was once in danger of being broken, mainly because securities firms and money exchange businesses competed to sell. Although another securities firm still came to search and absorb, it was not as good as a comfortable headwind, and the closing price slightly recovered. As a result, it was 5,510 yuan, smaller than the previous day's small by forty-five yuan, and the total daily transaction was about three thousand several hundred taels. Silver shop ornamental gold hung small by five yuan, and customs gold and so on were still flat.</p>
<p>First Up and Then Down</p>
<p>From the morning, each bar (ten taels), the initial opening exchange rate reported a rise, and the US dollar hardened, but people's minds were still good, so the opening fall was not much. First, a certain cash firm entered the silver firm for thirty taels, for 5,550 yuan, which was only 5 yuan smaller than the previous day's transaction. Subsequently, a certain securities firm absorbed, and retail investors also bought in one after another, and it suddenly rose by thirty yuan. The securities firm entered the gold firm for ten taels, for 5,580 yuan. Then, a certain money exchange group and another squinting coupon bull took advantage of the high price to sell him, and it immediately fell back thirty yuan. Afterwards, an additional floating also came to share it, and the sleeping coupon also continued to block it, and it fell by more than thirty yuan. The silver firm exited a certain Qing coupon for twenty taels, for 5,515 yuan. After that, a certain let the agent drag in, and the sellers had gradually decreased, so it returned to twenty-three yuan. The money exchange business entered the gold firm for fifty taels, for 5,538 yuan. The first step was for a certain securities firm and the money exchange business to come back to sell it again, and it fell back down twenty-eight yuan. The gold firm exited the silver firm for ten taels, for 5,510 yuan. Later, another money exchange business turned out to be an entry, and at the same time, the silver shop also had a purchase, and it saw a recovery of forty yuan. The money exchange business entered the silver firm for thirty taels, for 5,550 yuan. Near the closing time, a certain silver firm sold out ten yuan, and the silver firm exited the gold firm for thirty taels, for 5,540 yuan, as the noon closing price. The afternoon market opened and raised twenty yuan. The gold firm mutually traded twenty taels, for 5,560 yuan. Suddenly, the silver firms and others bought in, and it was fifteen yuan higher. The silver firm entered the securities firm for ten taels, for 5,575 yuan. After this, a certain securities firm suddenly came to sell forcefully, and it was suddenly seen to fall. Later, although another securities firm took the opportunity to absorb more than two hundred taels, it was finally because at this time, the foreign exchange collection was required, and the money exchange business and retail investors and so on raced in the market, and the supply and demand for headwind was uneven, and it continued to fall dozens of yuan. The gold firm exited the money exchange business for thirty taels, for 5,500 yuan. Later, because the US dollar returned to parity, the money exchange business immediately took advantage of the low price to make up for it. Before long, a certain securities firm also turned out to be an entry, and it gradually became twenty-five yuan higher. The gold firm entered the silver firm for ten taels, for 5,525 yuan. After a certain time, the securities firm that had initially forcefully absorbed, suddenly came to repeat it, and it fell again by fifteen yuan. The gold firm exited the silver firm for twenty taels, for 5,510 yuan, as the late closing price, and the result was a small return of forty-five yuan compared to the previous day, with an eighty yuan range throughout the day. The selling price of the main brand gold of the cash firm, according to the dry red, was higher by several yuan, and the receiving price was reduced by twenty yuan. The current standard gold was fifty yuan lower than the listed gold, and there were few transactions.</p>
<p>Ornamental Gold Hangs Low by Five Yuan</p>
<p>The initial price of the sterling gold jewellery per tael exchanged by the silver shops was still 560 yuan by Datong. Until 3:35 PM, it hung small by five yuan. As a result, Datong changed to hang 555 yuan. The new peers were the same as the above price, and the receiving price was reduced by about fifteen yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e53">Foreign Currency Rise Has Already Passed <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market conditions, the British and American gold pounds in the morning supply and demand were still flat, in the afternoon because the gold price hovered downward, all parties' supply was more ample, the market price slowly stepped down, the US dollar ticket finally fell because the pound price continued to rise, and the US dollar exchange rate turned loose. In the early morning, the selling atmosphere was particularly strong, and it once retreated to 16 yuan and 3 angles, and then it was once raised to 16 yuan and 5 angles, but this rising wind was only a flash in the pan, and it was immediately lowered, and the after price was 16 yuan and 3 angles and 7 points. However, the trend of British gold tickets was still firm, and the need for Annam tickets was not weak. The supply of French franc tickets was very smooth, and Canadian tickets and Philippine tickets were all turned to a weak trend. Japanese gold tickets remained firm, and the night market was at 1 yuan, 3 angles, 1 point, and 3 points. There was no shortage of people who needed North Korean tickets, and the market price continued to rise, and the night market was at 1 yuan and 3 points.

<p>The rice market, after a period of tightness followed by weakness, seemed unpromising yesterday morning. However, contrary to expectations, it surged again, rising by more than one yuan. At its peak, No. 1 Saigon rice opened at 46.5 yuan, No. 2 at 42.5 yuan, "Fire" rice at 45 yuan, and "Small" rice at 41.5 yuan. However, once prices rose, sales became sluggish, and prices retreated again. Customers from the interior and rural areas, seeing the market trend stabilize, with a fairly solid footing and seemingly no immediate significant downturn, all began to purchase. Traders also held onto their stocks, as usual. The market then rose again by more than one yuan, but traders immediately paused. Upon news of longer credit terms for alcohol and beverages, the market weakened slightly. By the close, prices were roughly the same as the previous day. Although the arrival of japonica and glutinous domestic rice was not substantial, with only a little over a thousand bags transferred from Hongkou yesterday, sales were also quite normal. The final result was the same as foreign rice.</p>
<p>Foreign rice carried the momentum from the afternoon futures surge. Market sentiment was strong, and aside from actual sales to local customers, speculative activity was also quite lively. As a result, spot prices were immediately raised by 50-60 cents. No. 1 Saigon reached 46 yuan again. However, after the early morning rally in return futures, many bulls took the opportunity to exit the market. Coupled with stable gold prices and lower overseas quotes, the market initially rallied but then flattened out. In the afternoon, selling pressure resurfaced, leading to weakness. Return futures for No. 2 Saigon for April/May opened at 51.2 yuan in the morning, but by noon, April had fallen to 50.07-0.08 yuan. Afternoon trades for delivery on the "Yay" day dropped to 50.05 yuan, with difficulty selling all available quantities. April No. 1 was at 53.5 yuan, but the afternoon saw a reduction of half a yuan, yet sales remained slow. Small varieties were at 49.5 yuan, and Siamese rice was at 50.03 yuan. Total futures volume for the day was over 700 tons, and spot volume was around 6,000 bags.</p>
<p>In other news, the durum wheat market saw scarce arrivals, especially white japonica rice. Market inventories were notably low. According to reporter inquiries, a Japanese trading firm recently shipped a large batch of powdered japonica rice from Wuxi, numbering over 3,000 bags. 600 bags had already been sold to grain merchants at a low price of 43 yuan, severely impacting the covert market for domestic rice yesterday. The morning market was relatively stable, but the afternoon saw a weakening trend. "No Peak" rice fell from 47 yuan to 46.5 yuan, and yellow and white varieties fell from 45 yuan to 44 yuan. Qingpu high-grade thin rice was at 45-46 yuan, and Jiaoli thin rice was at 43.7 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e57">Return Flour Stable, Wheat Prices Flat <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>The flour market continued to be stable yesterday. The price of No. 2 flour from the flour mill remained at 13.8 yuan, unchanged. Return flour with older brands, having previously declined, was now cheaper than the mill price. Therefore, there was some buying from the interior and rural areas. However, current sales to customers remain difficult to improve, and sentiment is generally lackluster. It is rumored that the "Green Cannon" brand had bids at 15 yuan, but no formal transactions took place. Yesterday, the old brand of warehouse receipts opened at 13.77-0.78 yuan, a slight increase from the previous day. Flour from Japanese mills, such as the Phoenix and Double Lion brands, also saw slight gains. Total market transactions were only 2-3 thousand bags. Wholesale purchases from factories on this street were approximately 6-7 thousand bags.</p>
<p>The wheat market remained relatively flat. Demand from mills was not strong, and speculators and exporters showed little interest. However, sellers were stubbornly holding onto their stock and unwilling to sell cheaply, making price movements difficult. As a result, only Fufeng Mill purchased a little over a thousand bags of Wuxi wheat, with the price remaining at 23.5 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e58">Miscellaneous Grains: Difficult to be Optimistic about Soybeans <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the soybean market initially followed the sharp declines of the previous day, continuing to fall in the morning. Midday saw some bargain-hunting from interior cart operators, leading to speculative hoarding, which provided some stability to the market sentiment. However, given the weak sales situation, it is unlikely that optimistic views about the future can be sustained. Total market transactions were only over 700 bags of Wuhu beans, priced at 21-22.8 yuan, and 140 bags of Nanjing beans, priced at 20.08 yuan. Sangyuan beans saw 150 bags, priced at 20.02 yuan; Yangzhou genuine beans saw one cartload, priced at 20 yuan; and Pingchao Du beans saw 20 bags, priced at 25.2 yuan.</p>
<p>In addition, 270 bags of soybeans were shipped to Hong Kong yesterday. Today (the 3rd), 350 bags of soybeans and five cans of crude oil will be shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3 id="e59">Securities: Small Gains in Domestic Bonds, Foreign Shares Restrained by Selling <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>The securities market was extremely flat yesterday. Buyers generally intended to make small purchases, but they were unwilling to bid up prices. It is expected that the market will rise due to short covering. Currently, most transactions are for switching positions, selling one and buying another in hopes of profiting. However, shorts are wary of the upcoming draw for Type C shares. Yesterday morning, Defu Yichang, Jiufeng, and Hengfu all made purchases. Hengkang bought a lot of Type C shares. Lemao bought Type B and sold Type C shares, while Yongkang solely acquired Type A shares. Liany and retail investors mostly sold, causing the market to strengthen slightly. In the afternoon, Type C shares saw the most trading. Tongkang, Hongkang, and No. 41 all had considerable demand, while No. 38, No. 41, and Lemao offered a lot of Type C shares. Different parties had different investment perspectives. Lemao also bought Type B shares, and No. 41 also bought Type A shares. Yuankang had demand across the board. As a result of these differing views, the market was slightly mixed, with fluctuations of only 5-10 cents. The total turnover was approximately 800,000 yuan. A summary table is listed below.</p>
<p>Regarding stock transactions, 30 shares of Guanshengyuan stock were traded at a price of 35 yuan each.</p>
<p>The public utilities stock market was restrained by selling pressure. In the first hour after the opening, prices were very weak. However, low prices attracted buying activity, so most prices quickly recovered. However, there were very few buyers offering high prices. As a result, the market became quiet. Yihua Spinning stock attracted attention due to high yarn prices. British and Federated stock, which had been ignored for the past one or two weeks, seemed to be on an upward trend due to rumors of the resolution of labor disputes. The closing price was 38.25 yuan with buyers. There was a lot of trading in China Land Reclamation stock. Although sellers were very powerful during trading, prices were able to remain stable. The leather stock market was bleak, with little activity from buyers and sellers. There was a lot of trading in Jian Gezhi stock. The closing price was very stable, with many people buying at a price of 32.75 yuan.</p>
<p>London, 1st (Dispatch 1): Today, the listed prices of Far East companies stocks in London experienced minimal fluctuations. The price of the Baoan Insurance stock rose by 1.5 pounds, reaching 29.5 pounds. The price of Kulak Rubber stock fell by 3 pence, reaching 18 shillings and 9 pence.</p>
<p>London, 1st (Monday) Dispatch: Today, the listed prices of Chinese foreign bonds remained stable. There were no changes in the prices of various bridge bonds.</p>

<p>The yarn market turned from flat to tight, with a good trend. This was due to strong procurement in Guangdong the previous day, which boosted market sentiment and increased buying interest. Although the US exchange rate had lengthened, traders remained enthusiastic. 20-count Double Horse yarn for this month had already reached 1140 yuan.</p>
<p>The spot yarn market opened with a lengthened British and American exchange rate, and the market sentiment was peaceful. The opening price for 20-count Double Horse yarn for this month was 1110 yuan. The low opening price attracted many buyers, and the market gradually rose to 1145 yuan. After some profit-taking caused a slight pullback of 3-4 yuan. The Hong Kong market saw a total trading volume of 4335 bales during half the day. The spot price for 20-count Double Horse yarn rose by 35 yuan. On the 2nd, cotton yarn exports included 520 pieces shipped to Haiphong, 105 pieces shipped to Hong Kong, 65 pieces shipped to Tianjin, and 75 pieces of piece goods shipped to Hong Kong, 82 pieces shipped to Yantai, 110 pieces shipped to Tianjin, and 370 pieces shipped to Haiphong. The volume of spot yarn purchased by various trading houses is listed as follows: Same Trade: 2,505; Hong Kong: 1,830; Total: 4,335.</p>
<h3 id="e61">Local Cotton Transactions Sluggish; Large Quantities of American Cotton Arrive in Shanghai <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>Local cotton transactions were very sluggish. Apart from some buying interest from the Shenxin Mill, there was little progress from other mills. This was due to the sharp decline in Indian cotton prices, making procurement cheaper. Furthermore, a large quantity of high-grade cotton had been purchased. This exerted pressure on the local market. Therefore, although yarn prices were steadily advancing, cotton prices were moving in the opposite direction. Additionally, the exchange rate turned to lengthen, making the outlook for the cotton market less optimistic. The current situation of spot cotton is as follows:</p>
<p>Tongzhou Cotton 205.00 Same Trade Purchase 80 bales</p>
<p>Tongzhou Bales 214.00 Same Trade Purchase 100 pieces</p>
<p>And 219.00 Shenxin No. 9 Mill Purchase 300 pieces</p>
<p>Durilla 211.50 Same Trade Purchase 600 pieces</p>
<p>Durilla 214.00 Same Trade Sometimes 600 pieces</p>
<p>Mitelin 280.00 Same Trade 280 pieces</p>
<p>Another news item regarding foreign cotton market prices: The New York cotton market initially declined yesterday morning due to increased selling pressure. Later, due to sales by spot traders and hedging by the Nanjing traders in the market, closing prices fell by 8-9 British units compared to the previous day. Indian cotton continued to fall yesterday, with a combined drop of 4 rupees including forecasts. Egyptian cotton fell by 3-4 British units.</p>
<p>In the Shanghai foreign cotton market, due to the soaring yarn prices in recent days, mills showed slightly more interest. As a result, spot Indian cotton in the market was almost completely purchased. Currently, all parties are placing orders for goods ready for shipment. These Indian cotton shipments are expected to arrive in late May. Their selling price is over ten yuan cheaper than local cotton. Japanese manufacturers were relatively quiet. The converted ex-mill prices for yesterday's cotton market, using a US exchange rate of 6.0625 yuan, are as follows:</p>
<p>20-count American Mitelin 287.60</p>
<p>20-count American Mitelin Lower Grade 278.20</p>
<p>32-count 303.80</p>
<p>32-count Lower Grade 293.50</p>
<p>42-count 301.20</p>
<p>42-count Lower Grade 291.00</p>
<p>A large batch of American cotton arrived in Shanghai on the American President Lines company manager's ship Cripple Breek, with a total of over 5,700 pieces of cotton. The ship docked at the Qichang Wharf in Pudong at 10:00 am yesterday. It is rumored that even larger quantities of cotton will continue to arrive in the coming days.</p>
<h3 id="e62">Silk &amp; Tea: Shanghai Silk Quiet, Wuxi Silkworm Seed Soars <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's silk market saw significant declines in both the US and Japan. New York saw a drop of nine cents for near-term contracts and ten cents for distant contracts. Yokohama spot opened at 1530 yuan, down 50 yuan, and distant contracts opened at 1939 yuan, down 32 yuan. The afternoon closing price fell by another 50 yuan or so. As a result, the local silk market was quiet. The difference between the telegraphic prices for white filature and the prices from the Shanghai firms was 60-70 yuan (the telegraphic price for white filature was 2900 yuan for extra high grades, and the firm's price was 5000 yuan), making transactions difficult to conclude. The foreign declines were likely related to the actual sales of raw silk in New York last month. The situation for raw silk in New York in March showed no signs of improvement.</p>
<p>Wuxi is a well-known sericulture region. Last year, farmers sold their cocoons at unprecedented high prices during both the spring and autumn cocoon seasons, further increasing their interest in silkworm breeding. The spring cocoon season is approaching rapidly. Due to the high profits involved, farmers will increase production by at least one-third compared to last year. However, there is a shortage of good silkworm seed. The "Huazhong Silk Company" controlled by the Japanese only supplies 300,000 sheets, which is still insufficient. As a result, silkworm seed vendors are hoarding. The "Tiger Brand" on the market has already risen to 3-4 yuan per sheet, and mixed brands are around 2 yuan, with the cheapest at 1.6-1.7 yuan (good quality).</p>
<h3 id="e63">Sugar Market: Red Sugar Soars <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>According to a telegram from the Netherlands, coarse sugar was at 8.75 guilders, C.I.F. KG. A telegram from Hong Kong reported the opening prices for mill sugar: B Mark white sugar at 15.6 yuan, CW Mark at 15.5 yuan, DY Mark at 15.3 yuan, and HX Mark at 15.2 yuan, all in Hong Kong dollars. The Dutch United Office in Shanghai opened 3,514 bags of WA Mark Dutch red sugar at a price of 52 yuan. At the same time, they also opened 2,250 bags of Taikoo H Mark new red sugar at a price of 49 yuan. These were sold out on the spot. The price trend for the Public Association was stable. Ex-warehouse spot prices for 24 crude white sugar were 63 yuan, while new stock from foreign warehouses was 62.9-62.8 yuan, and old stock arriving in July was 62.4 yuan. Re-exported sugar was 49 yuan. Taikoo crude white sugar saw little change. Local mill ice sugar was 75 yuan, up half a yuan. Domestic sugar opened with over 200 bags of Haikou foreign sugar, priced at 51-52 yuan, then fell to 49 yuan.</p>

<p>First-grade Wenzhou charcoal has seen robust sales recently. However, March, the spring season, is a typically slow season for charcoal sales. The effect of oversupply on prices is becoming more pronounced. Recently, private deals among traders for first-grade charcoal have been offered at 9.5 yuan, but no one is buying. Other varieties, such as Haimen goods and Pingmao Huangyan charcoal, have also seen a slight decline. The market price is 6.5-6.6 yuan per picul, with a loading fee of one cent per picul at the pier.</p>

<p>Regarding the Japanese side's request to the Shanghai Municipal Council to increase the number of Japanese councilors, a similar request was made once in 1936. At that time, the request was only for one additional seat. However, due to strong opposition from all parties, it did not materialize. This year, the issue has been raised again, with the number of candidates increased to as many as five, and the request to increase the number of Japanese councilors by three. Publicly, they have also declared that "all preparations have been made" and that "this is a good opportunity to avenge the past." This "tragic determination" (these phrases are found in the Continental News and New Shenbao) has astonished Chinese and foreign figures. Yesterday, English-language newspapers such as the American Greater Shanghai Evening Post and the British Times and North-China Daily News have all published articles criticizing the Japanese side's extravagant hopes. They admit that this critical juncture is a struggle between British and American figures and the Japanese side for control of the Shanghai International Settlement. They strongly urge British and American figures not to ignore this. Future developments are of great importance. The Japanese side's so-called fundamental principles are roughly two points: "First, to apply modifications appropriate to the new situation to the traditional British dictatorship that dominates the Shanghai International Settlement as if it were a special concession; second, to fundamentally review the structure and financial problems of the Shanghai Municipal Council in order to allow Japan to have legitimate influence, reflect the interests of the city, and increase the welfare of all nationalities in the Shanghai International Settlement." Clearly, the Japanese side's goal is to exclude the forces of Britain and America and further interfere in the administration of the Shanghai International Settlement.</p>
<p>Elections will be held within the next week, split across two days</p>
<p>According to reliable sources, the most difficult and important election in the history of the Shanghai International Settlement will be held within the next week (April 10th and 11th). A total of thirteen people are competing in this election, with only nine seats available. According to an official announcement released yesterday afternoon, the thirteen candidates include five British citizens (namely Heilai, Kaiziwei, Lotlich McDonald, Miqier, and Weier), two American citizens (namely Kana and Alemann), five Japanese citizens (namely Yuxiong Taro, Okamura Yiichi, Kuroda Keita, Okamura Isaku, and Tashiro Makoto), and one independent candidate, Reno McDonald (British citizen, one beyond the regulation of one candidate for every thousand people), for a total of thirteen people. The voting time is set for 10:00 AM to 3:00 PM on both days. The Shanghai Municipal Council also announced yesterday that Mr. Sheriff had been elected as a member of the Real Estate Committee upon the proposal of Burke and the endorsement of Mira.</p>
<p>Changing the Status Quo is Impossible</p>
<p>According to observers yesterday, this election will be the most intense ever. The total number of candidates nominated by all parties has now torn up the "gentleman's agreement." They all believe that Japanese residents will not be able to obtain five board positions in the Shanghai Municipal Council. The number of seats they can obtain will depend on how many votes Westerners cast for Japanese candidates. They believe that an agreement may be reached among these three countries within the next week. Yesterday, the slogan "Maintain the Status Quo" was issued among British residents. Although the Japanese side has repeatedly declared that they do not want to control the administration of the Shanghai Municipal Council, if Japanese candidates obtain an absolute or relative majority in the Shanghai Municipal Council, the administration of the Shanghai Municipal Council will inevitably undergo changes.</p>
<p>Aiming to Seize the British Position</p>
<p>Hayashi Yuji, Chairman of the Japanese Residents Election Committee for this Municipal Council, issued a statement at 11:00 AM on the 1st. The original text is as follows: "The Japanese side has decided to participate in the election campaign in order to nominate five municipal council members. The Japanese population in Shanghai has increased rapidly in recent years. The Japanese population within and around the settlement now amounts to 70,000. Therefore, the number of eligible voters among the Japanese in the International Settlement has reached nearly 3,800 this year, decisively occupying the first place among the number of eligible voters of all countries, far surpassing the 2,800 eligible voters of the British side, who currently have five municipal council members. Therefore, it is only natural for the Japanese side to hope to increase the current two municipal council members to five. However, what the Japanese side seeks is to eliminate the dictatorship of specific countries over the Shanghai International Settlement, to seek the internationalization of the settlement, so that people of all countries residing in the settlement can fairly participate in the administration of the settlement, and to fundamentally review the structure and finances of the Shanghai Municipal Council, so that the settlement is placed on a permanent and solid foundation, thereby improving the welfare of all nationalities in the settlement. The Japanese side absolutely does not seek to monopolize the administration of the Shanghai International Settlement."</p>
<p>Seeking to Internationalize the Settlement</p>
<p>The fact that the Japanese side is nominating five municipal council members this time, seeking to break the anomalous structure of the Shanghai International Settlement, is nothing more than a necessary means for the Japanese side to achieve its goals. However, the Japanese side is not forever fixated on five municipal council members. Specifically, the Japanese side first wants to amend the current Land Regulations, which are not suitable for the current situation, and increase the number of municipal council members so that all countries can fairly participate in the administration of the settlement. If this cannot be implemented immediately, then the ratio of the current nine municipal council members should be made as fair and international as possible. In order to achieve this goal, the Japanese side must first strengthen the Japanese side's right to speak in the administration of the settlement.</p>
<p>Sovereignty Over the Settlement Still Belongs to China</p>
<p>An editorial in the English-language Greater Shanghai Evening Post roughly stated that although the number of Japanese residents in Shanghai has indeed increased, Japanese residents fundamentally lack a historical presence in the Shanghai International Settlement. If the number of candidates is determined by the population, then Chinese residents would be able to control everything in the Shanghai International Settlement long ago. Therefore, the settlement is based on economic factors, and Westerners have greater economic interests in Shanghai than Japanese residents. As for the future of the settlement, it is generally believed that it will eventually be fully returned to China one day. However, Western residents cannot agree to the Japanese side's desire to occupy an absolute advantage in the settlement. The Japanese are currently conducting a war of aggression against China, and the Japanese position in the war is not superior. Therefore, Western residents believe that Japanese residents have no right to demand control at this time. Therefore, Western residents unanimously oppose the Japanese side's current actions. There are two reasons for this: (1) the administration of the Shanghai International Settlement has already been Westernized. Without the consent of the Chinese government, the administrative attitude cannot be changed and handed over to another party. (2) Although the Japanese side claims that it can make the settlement "truly internationalized" after taking over, Western residents do not believe that past actions provide a guarantee for this. On the contrary, based on past experience, if the Japanese side takes over the administration of the settlement, the Shanghai Municipal Council will change to become "Japanese controlled."</p>
<p>British and American Interests are of Utmost Importance</p>
<p>An editorial in the North-China Daily News roughly stated that with the Japanese side's sudden announcement of increasing the number of candidates to as many as five, a fact that has never been seen in Shanghai's history, the situation for this Municipal Council board election has become serious. We deeply believe that the correct and strict facts have been placed before the taxpayers of the Shanghai International Settlement. Does the increase in the number of Japanese residents in Shanghai and the expansion of their power mean that they can exceed the number of Chinese and obtain the right to administer the Shanghai Municipal Council? This can be answered without thinking. The gentleman's agreement on the ratio of candidates for the British, American, and Japanese residents has been in place for many years. Now, due to the increase in the number of Japanese residents, there is a request to increase the number of board members. This request was noted by all parties last year. Now, the Japanese suddenly announced that the number of candidates has increased to as many as five. In this year's taxpayer election, nine people will be selected from among the twelve candidates (five British, two American, and five Japanese). However, we absolutely find it difficult to deeply believe that British, American, and Japanese candidates need to compete again. Therefore, the way to resolve this is to re-establish an agreement and reduce the number of candidates.</p>
<p>The European and American Electorates Cooperate to Restrain Japan</p>
<p>After the Japanese side announced that the number of Japanese taxpayers had reached 3,000 and the number of candidates in the municipal council board election has increased to as many as five, violating the long-standing practice and damaging the Land Regulations, Western candidates in this port, in view of this, have advised European and American voters not to vote for Japanese candidates in order to resist.</p>
<h3 id="e66">French Concession Price Equalization Association Discusses Rice Industry Transportation and Sales Cooperation; Small Group Meeting Held This Afternoon; Authorities to Severely Punish Speculators <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>The Price Equalization Committee attached to the French Municipal Council, after several meetings, has developed a plan for stabilizing prices and will implement it. It is reported that the committee will hold another meeting of the three subcommittees of the Price Equalization Committee at 3:00 PM today. The important issues to be discussed are said to be related to the joint transportation and sales cooperation of the rice industry in the Shanghai Special District. This issue was also discussed at the previous subcommittee meeting, but because detailed rules and regulations were not yet finalized, only a preliminary consultation was conducted. Subsequently, Xiang De Kui, representing the Public Works Department, convened rice industry leaders to proceed with the matter. Although this issue was discussed at the joint meeting of the seven rice industry groups the day before, due to the small number of participating representatives and the lack of detailed rules and regulations for study, and because the matter was significant, it was decided that each group would hold separate consultations before responding. Representatives from various rice industry groups, including Zhu Zixiang and two others, will also attend today's meeting of the three subcommittees to participate in the discussion.</p>
<p>Discussion of Regulations</p>
<p>A reporter from Da Zhong News Agency interviewed Mr. Yan Fang yesterday. According to him, the draft of "Establishing a Shanghai Metropolitan Area Rice Industry Joint Transportation and Sales Cooperative," in both Chinese and English, is being rushed to the printers and should be ready today, so that it can be provided for discussion at the afternoon's meeting of the three subcommittees. Its contents are divided into fifteen sections, detailing the outline of its organization, the benefits to citizens after the organization's establishment, and the potential profits for rice merchants. It also includes insightful discussions on alleviating public concerns about the future of rice supply.</p>
<p>Eliminating Speculation</p>
<p>The reporter then inquired whether the more than one hundred existing rice shops and the thousand or so rice dealers in the city would abandon their rice business habits and invest all their remaining funds in this organization. Also, there are quite a few people in the city who are not originally from the rice industry but are involved in the rice business; it is feared that they may not all be included. Currently, the total rice reserves in the city amount to over one million bags, with total capital between forty and fifty million yuan, some of which is from the capital of these rice merchants. These merchants, whose rice business is temporary, mostly use this capital for speculative operations, and it is expected that they will be unwilling to join this organization, because they would certainly not want to see their capital frozen in rice. He replied that the instability of rice prices in the city is largely due to the harm of using floating capital to participate in rice market speculation. "The purpose of transportation and sales cooperation is partly to eliminate the bad behavior of such people participating in the rice market. As for the rice merchants, they may initially have doubts, but once they understand the details of the regulations and realize that they are not disadvantaged, they will be relieved."</p>
<p>Government Attention</p>
<p>He added that with the support of the authorities and the assistance of the public, it should not be difficult to achieve this in the short term. The city's financial circles and powerful groups should be encouraged to actively participate in the promotion and implementation. Currently, the city's rice prices are fluctuating, and at the opening of the rice industry tea market, rice prices often rise sharply. However, after strict supervision by the Market Management Committee and the implementation of limited quantities, they gradually return to normal, but the end result is inevitably an increase. If it were not for speculators secretly manipulating the market before the opening, such a phenomenon would never occur. Now the authorities will severely punish these people.</p>

<h3 id="e67">Fake "Central Market" Deprives Small People of Livelihoods; The Extraction Methods Devised are Extremely Detailed; Vendors Unwilling to Go There, Business is Miserable <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>The fake "Central Market" opened the day before yesterday. At that time, because most vegetable vendors had not received "entry and exit permits," they did not do business. Yesterday, under the coercion of the Japanese and puppet authorities, the vegetable vendors purchased "entry and exit permits" and were supposed to officially start business yesterday morning. However, because the supply of local goods was sufficient in areas such as the 16th Embankment, most vegetable vendors were unwilling to purchase goods there, resulting in extremely dismal business at the "market" yesterday. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Miserable Situation</p>
<p>Yesterday morning at 5:00 AM, the "market" distributed the local goods seized the day before at the North Station and Suzhou Creek to the merchants participating in the "market," who then wholesaled them to vegetable vendors for distribution and sale in various places. However, because most villagers were unwilling to be exploited by the Japanese and puppet authorities, they secretly transported local goods to Shanghai, evading the Japanese and puppet interception. As a result, the "market" intercepted only a limited amount of local goods, and the villagers sold all the local goods transported to Shanghai to local goods merchants at the 16th Embankment and other places. Therefore, the supply of goods was sufficient there yesterday, and vegetable vendors did not need to purchase goods from the "market," resulting in extremely dismal business at the fake "market" yesterday, with great difficulty in selling goods. In addition, only a few local goods merchants in the city were coerced into joining, so the "market" was deserted yesterday, and the scene was extremely desolate.</p>
<p>Multiple Exploitations</p>
<p>The "market" operates by adopting a bidding transaction method, whereby the Japanese and puppet authorities have the local goods they seized purchased by the participating merchants who offer the highest price, and then these brokers wholesale them to vegetable vendors. The procedures are complicated, and there are multiple exploitations. The local goods sold by the Japanese and puppet authorities are all forcibly purchased at the lowest price, and then sold to the local goods merchants at the highest price during the auction. Therefore, the Japanese and puppet authorities make a considerable profit, with interest rates as high as 30%. Villagers who used to transport local goods to Shanghai could earn more than 10% profit, but now, due to the Japanese and puppet control, their income has been greatly reduced, and their profits are only enough to offset transportation costs. With soaring prices, many villagers rely on selling local goods for a living, and this has had a tremendous impact, making their lives even more difficult.</p>
<p>Forced Payment of Security Deposits</p>
<p>The local goods merchants who join the "market" must rent business premises in the "market's" vegetable sheds. Even a small area of five or six feet costs more than one hundred yuan to rent. The size of the business premises depends on the amount of the "security deposit." "Security deposits" range from five hundred yuan, one thousand yuan, or more than one hundred yuan. The Japanese and puppet authorities, in order to extract "security deposits," feared that individual local goods merchants would be unwilling to join, so they came up with a unique idea and adopted a guarantee system. For example, if all the local goods merchants in the Old Zhabei Bridge area join the "market," their "security deposit" would be 120,000 yuan, which could be allocated by the local goods shops themselves. For the 16th Embankment, it would be 100,000 yuan. The amount of the "security deposit" determines the status and business volume of the merchant in the "market." The reason why the Japanese and puppet authorities demand a "security deposit" is not only to extract interest but also to prevent the local goods merchants from withdrawing after joining, because if they withdraw without reason, this cash is likely to be confiscated.</p>

<p>The bombing of the Nanjing-Shanghai Railway train in Changzhou on the 29th of last month has been confirmed. According to reliable sources yesterday, the train was Train No. 9, and the incident occurred at 6:10 AM between Changzhou and Xinzha.

<p>According to the Shanghai Tientsin Times, the Chinese Post Office no longer forwards packages containing German goods to Kunming and areas beyond, as all packages sent there must pass through Haiphong in French Indochina. The French authorities there strictly control German goods. Postal Administration officials stated that German goods and their postal packages transiting through Haiphong into the Chinese mainland would be regarded by the French as contraband during wartime and confiscated. Mailers should henceforth indicate on the packages whether they contain German goods to avoid being opened and confiscated by the authorities in Haiphong.</p>

<p>The U.S. Consul General in Shanghai, and newly appointed Australian Minister, Gauss, is scheduled to board the President Taft tonight, setting sail for the United States at 1:00 AM tomorrow morning. It is reported that at 4:00 PM this afternoon, the U.S. Marine Corps will send a guard of honor to bid farewell. Mr. Gauss's trip is to San Francisco to meet with his family, and then to Washington, D.C., to pay a visit to President Roosevelt and take the oath of office. Mr. Puttrick has been acting as Consul General in Gauss's stead. The new consul has not yet been announced, as the U.S. government considers Shanghai to be the most important commercial port in the Far East, and therefore must carefully consider the selection of the consul for this city.</p>
<h3 id="e71">Surviving Gambling Dens in Western Shanghai Face Extremely Bleak Prospects; Huge License Fees Will Be Difficult to Bear <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>Since the puppet "Municipal Government" signed a police agreement with the Public Works Department regarding road construction beyond the borders, there has been talk of closing gambling dens in Western Shanghai. It was not until the night before last that ten gambling dens were truly forced to close. There are still fourteen surviving dens. According to information gathered yesterday, the Asian General Association at 65 Gordon Road, the only gambling den within the borders, has been forced to close since yesterday.</p>
<p>According to an observer, the lifespan of the large and small gambling dens that can still exist in the Western Shanghai area will not exceed one or two months. Since April 1st, some of the smaller gambling dens in Western Shanghai have felt increasingly unable to cope with the intense competition in the business and have closed down one after another. More than ten gambling dens have encountered this kind of difficulty in the past month. Since the puppet government announced that license fees would be greatly increased starting this month, it has become even more difficult for these struggling small gambling dens to survive. Although the exact amount of the license fees currently collected is unknown, it is rumored that the cost of each new license is 50,000 yuan, which is unbearable for smaller gambling dens. Moreover, in addition to this huge license fee, the cost of the "outer defense line" for each gambling den is at least 50,000 yuan. These burdens are difficult to bear compared to past business conditions. Therefore, the various small gambling dens have had no choice but to close down one after another. The larger gambling dens, on the one hand, expressed surprise at the reduction in competition because the various small gambling dens had already been forced to close down due to the increase in license fees; on the other hand, they expressed concern, because it is difficult to predict how they will deal with this increase in license fees.</p>
<h3 id="e72">Shortage of Goods in British and French Markets: Telegrams Sent to Shanghai for Procurement; Excellent Opportunity to Promote National Goods <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the European war, factories in Britain and France have switched to manufacturing war supplies, reducing the production of other goods. However, the scope of consumption remains significant. Therefore, various commercial markets in Europe have been sending telegrams to Shanghai or Hong Kong to procure large quantities of daily necessities, causing national goods factories in Shanghai to operate day and night, shipping goods abroad in batches. Among them, cotton textiles are the most common. It is reported that various national goods factories in the city, in view of the fact that it was not easy to sell national goods in European markets in the past, and that this opportunity is hard to come by, once gathered together to discuss how to promote sales abroad on a large scale. They have already agreed to: (1) improve the quality of products and not mix inferior raw materials; (2) abide by the agreed delivery dates and not delay delivery. If delivery cannot be made on time due to unforeseen circumstances, the ordering party should be notified ten days in advance, otherwise, the public deliberation office will impose penalties; (3) because of the long distance and time required for transportation, the products should be carefully packaged to avoid moisture; (4) send letters to overseas Chinese communities, explaining the characteristics of national goods in detail, and hoping that they will do more publicity and help promote sales. It is reported that these resolutions have been implemented separately by each factory. It is also reported that due to the recent warming weather, there is a high demand for knitted goods such as undershirts and spring and autumn shirts. Various knitting factories in the city have increased production and are shipping them in batches.</p>
<h3 id="e73">Japanese Control of Silk: Raw Materials to Shanghai Silk Factories in the Interior Disrupted; Many Close Down; Moving to the Interior Achieves Several Objectives at Once <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>According to the Pingming News Agency, the supply of raw materials to Shanghai's silk factories has always relied on silk cocoons produced in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. Since the retreat of the Chinese army to the west, Jiangsu and western Zhejiang have inevitably fallen into the hands of the Japanese army. All goods are subject to control, and silk cocoons are naturally no exception and are also under control. It is absolutely impossible to transport them to Shanghai. Even those who occasionally purchase goods in the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo and Nanjing-Shanghai railway areas must give half of the purchased goods to the Japanese "Central China Company," which invisibly increases the cost, so few people go there to purchase.</p>
<p>Shortage of Raw Materials</p>
<p>The only source of raw materials is entirely dependent on eastern Zhejiang, and the quantity is naturally not as large as before. Therefore, more than thirty large and small silk factories in this city, such as Ewo, have closed down due to shortages. Those who are barely maintaining operations, or preparing to start operations, are only Tongcheng Yueyu, Hua Chang, Longchang, Meichang, Jifeng, and eight or nine others. These only eight or nine silk factories each need fifty or sixty *dan* of cocoons per day to produce two *dan* of silk. Annually calculated, no less than 17,000 to 18,000 *dan* are needed to cope. Usually, when the sericulture season is approaching, they apply to the government for licenses to set up stoves to collect cocoons.</p>
<p>Sluggish Silk Sales</p>
<p>Now that spring has arrived and the sericulture season is approaching, no one has yet been heard of wanting to set up cocoon shops in the interior. It is said that the price of silk per *dan* was about 6,400 yuan last year. Now, affected by the European war and the abolition of the U.S.-Japan trade treaty, the number of ships traveling to Europe and the United States should naturally decrease compared to normal times. The price of silk has fallen to about 5,000 yuan per *dan* due to poor sales. Silk and tea are major items in China's export trade, but now, due to Japanese control, the country and society suffer not a small loss. Therefore, silk factories such as Jianye have dismantled all their machinery and moved to the interior to operate, saving the trouble of transportation and avoiding the burden of control, which is truly the best policy for coping with the environment.</p>
<h3 id="e74">Australian Government Limits the Import of Chinese Goods: Consul General Negotiates for Improvement; Orders Placed Before the Implementation of the Regulations are Limited to the End of the Month; Import Licenses Must Be Obtained When Importing Goods <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>The Australian government implemented the Restricted Import Regulations for Goods from Non-Sterling Countries on November 1 of last year. In addition to Chinese goods, goods from twenty-two other countries are also restricted. The restriction method is based on Australia's wartime needs, dividing imported goods into four categories: (1) most needed; (2) less needed; (3) restricted imports; and (4) prohibited imports. For the third category of goods, the import quantity in 1939 is used as the benchmark, and is reduced by one-sixth each year. Regardless of categories one, two, or three, import licenses must be obtained when importing goods. As for the fourth category of goods, those purchased before implementation but not arriving in Australia by the 30th of this month will be prohibited from import. Chinese Consul General to Australia, Bao Junjian, considers that although this restriction is an Australian wartime regulation, it greatly affects the livelihoods of Chinese merchants and the future of Sino-Australian trade. He has made earnest representations to the Australian Commonwealth government. As for Chinese goods shipped to Australia, they are divided into five categories: (1) Chinese food; (2) Chinese daily necessities; (3) Chinese social and religious supplies; (4) Chinese handicrafts and cultural items; and (5) others. Categories one, two, and three are indispensable to overseas Chinese in Australia every day. Categories four and five are Chinese products and do not compete with Australian products, and are needed by the Australian people even in wartime.</p>
<p>Restricting or prohibiting the import of Chinese goods would be tantamount to forcing Chinese merchants to leave the country and return home. Consul General Bao has already requested instructions from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and has formally informed the Australian Commonwealth government to negotiate for improvement. It is reported that the Australian Commonwealth government has sent the Director of the Commercial Treaty Division of the Ministry of Trade to consult with Consul General Bao on improving the measures.</p>

<p>The Shanghai City Machine-Made Coal Briquette Industry Association was designated to organize its members to hold a coal briquette price stabilization sale.

<h3 id="e76">Construction Materials are All Controlled: Prices of Bricks, Stones, and Sand Increase Six or Seven Times <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>The sand and stone business, previously operated by Chinese merchants, had always been very free in transportation and sales, and prices were very low. Now, the sand and stone industry has been thoroughly controlled by the "Jiangnan Industrial Company" organized by the Japanese, strictly prohibiting Chinese merchants from direct transportation and sales. Before the war, the price of sand and stone was only 2.20 yuan per ton, but now, after being controlled, it has risen to 20.05 yuan this year, an increase of nine times compared to before. The transportation and sales of bricks and tiles and lime are now also completely controlled by the Japanese-organized "Civil Shipping Association." The price of bricks and tiles before the war was only 65 yuan per 10,000, but now it is 335 yuan per 10,000. The price of lime before the war was only 1.80 yuan per *tao*, but now it has risen to 8.10 yuan per *tao*. On average, the prices of these two items have increased by about six or seven times. Therefore, the sharp rise in the price of construction materials was unexpected by the construction industry. Now, the various commercial firms in the industry, in view of the pain of Japanese control, have resulted in the unemployment of a large number of workers and have been discussing countermeasures to overturn this illegal control.</p>

<p>In order to protect industry and production in the rear during wartime, the Ministry of Finance has allocated 10 million yuan to order the Central Trust Bureau to handle wartime land war risk insurance. After receiving the order, the Bureau has stipulated the scope of insurance, tentatively set as the following three types: (1) goods in warehouses (limited to agricultural, industrial, and mineral products and international trade items); (2) production tools and materials (limited to those belonging to the insured factory); and (3) buildings (limited to warehouses and factories in operation). It has already been opened in Chongqing and Kunming. This insurance was originally established to protect against bombing, as suggested by the Third National Political Consultative Conference and adopted on the spot by Chairman Chiang. As a result, investment in the interior has gained absolute protection.</p>

<p>Peace and Future: Discussion from Merchants; Shanghai City Bean and Rice Industry Association Announces Rice Shop Tea Market: Investigations of buying empty and selling empty have always been strictly prohibited. Rice and grains are necessities for the people, and absolutely must be traded in cash. In the business of foreign rice, with the exception of selling futures based on original invoices, buying empty and selling empty is not allowed. Otherwise, if there are disputes, this association and the Market Management Committee will not accept them, and the offender will be subject to legal sanctions. Fearing that people will become accustomed to violations over time, this announcement is made for everyone's information, and it is hoped that everyone will comply accordingly. The public rice sale of tribute rice is scheduled to temporarily end on the 7th of this month. In order to devise a proper method, the Price Stabilization Committee has scheduled a full committee meeting for the afternoon of the 6th of this month (Saturday) at the association's premises on Guangdong Road. At that time, whether the price stabilization should continue or be temporarily ended will be discussed at length.</p>

<p>Qingfeng Rice Shop in Xiangfeng Lane, Fada Malu. Qingyuan Rice Shop, No. 443 Zhonghui Building, Avenue Edward VII. Xie Mao Rice Shop, Fada Malu. Rendashun Rice Shop, No. 748 Xinzha Road. Yisheng Rice Shop, No. 3 Changfu Lane, Chengdu Road. Shunfeng Rice Shop, No. 103 Xinzha Road, and six other shops, recently at the Qingliange Teahouse rice market on Fuzhou Road, and No. 7, Lane 466, Tianjin Road, traded large amounts of rice with Xue Caizhang and Xu Jianlin, persons in charge of Yong Sheng Rice Shop. After Yong Sheng paid a small deposit, they shipped the rice, but after the 20th of last month, Yong Sheng Rice Shop suddenly hired a lawyer to announce liquidation. The unpaid balance to the above six shops totaled more than 48,300 yuan. Qingfeng and other shops believed that Yong Sheng's actions were clearly setting up a bogus firm to carry out fraudulent schemes. They hired lawyer Wu Linkun to report the matter to the Old Zhabei Police Station, requesting an investigation. Chinese detective Guo Ruiquan took charge of the investigation, but Xue and Xu's whereabouts were unknown, and they could not be arrested. Later, a partnership agreement for Yong Sheng Rice Shop was obtained from the Rice Shop Association on Shanhai Pass Road. According to the statements of the plaintiffs, most of the shareholders on the agreement often went to the rice market. Detectives went to the rice market on the morning of the day before yesterday and arrested.</p>
<p>Yong Sheng Shareholders</p>
<p>Wang Xingsheng from Ningbo (owner of Longsheng Rice Shop at No. 565 Sichuan Road), and Tong Zongyao from Shaoxing (also known as Shouren, owner of Yangtai Rice Shop at Nos. 278-9 Avenue Joffre), were escorted to the Criminal Court No. 4 of the First Special District Court yesterday morning. Police lawyer Peng Qixin stated that this case still required investigation and requested that the two defendants be temporarily detained. Questioned, Wang Xingsheng denied being a partner in Yong Sheng Rice Shop. He said that his name was Wang Xingsen, not Wang Xingsheng. Tong Zongyao also denied that his real name was Shouren. He said that Tong Shouren on the partnership agreement was someone else, and that the agreement stated that Tong Shouren was 47 years old, while he was only 26 years old. Wang's lawyers Wang Yaotang and Tao Wuzhi, and Tong's lawyer Jiang Yiping, requested that they be released on bail. Judge Zhan Liangce verified the statements and ruled that the case would be adjourned for further investigation. Wang and Tong were each granted bail of 30,000 yuan with a reliable shop as surety, pending trial.</p>

According to the newspaper (referring to the French newspaper itself), the term "life imprisonment" does not exist in French criminal law. In reality, during the first trial, the prosecutor did request that Wang be sentenced to life in hard labor, and the court of first instance approved this request. However, it is now reported that Wang Naida has filed an extraordinary appeal, and the case files have been sent to the Paris Court of Cassation for review.

<p>Eckford, a soldier in the West Yorkshire Regiment of the British garrison in Shanghai, was sentenced to death by hanging for fatally shooting a fellow soldier. His appeal was rejected. Two thousand British and American residents of this city jointly petitioned Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, the British Ambassador to China, to commute the sentence. Ambassador Kerr, after considering the matter, has approved the commutation of Eckford's death sentence to penal servitude and imprisonment. The notification was delivered to Ward Road Gaol by the British Embassy Office at 4 PM the day before yesterday. Warden Grant then informed Eckford in his cell. Upon hearing the news, Eckford showed no expression, only trembling slightly. Eckford originally hoped to be released and sent to the Western Front. Now, he will be transferred to a prison in England. However, according to wartime procedures, he may be sent to Hong Kong to serve his sentence. It is reported that on the evening of November 4th last year, Eckford, along with Lance Corporal Davis of the same battalion, was stationed at the iron gate on North Tibet Road. Due to an argument, Eckford fatally shot Davis with his service rifle. Consequently, he was detained and interrogated, and on January 11th of this year, he was sentenced to death by hanging by Sir Meredith Moss, the British Judge of the Supreme Court for China.</p>

<p>Zhou Changming, a 28-year-old woman from Tongxiang, Zhejiang, residing at 36 Jinghua New Village, Route Ghisi, French Concession, is the wife of Peng Qiqi, a lawyer at the First Special District Court and the Shanghai Municipal Council. She recently appointed lawyer Peng Qixiu as her agent and filed a lawsuit in the Civil Division of the Second Special District Court against her brother, Zhou Changchi (also known as Yangxi, residing at 209 Wenlin Road, a French student married to a French woman), for the return of a piano. The court accepted the case, and presiding judge Ma Yishu held a hearing yesterday afternoon. The plaintiff, Zhou Changming, accompanied by her lawyer, appeared in court and stated that in the 20th year of the Republic (1931), the school needed a piano. Zhou Changming obtained 500 yuan from her mother and purchased a Stravius (transliteration) piano (serial number 1942) from a music store at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Sichuan Road. The defendant borrowed the piano for his use and has not returned it to this day. Therefore, she has been forced to sue for the return of the piano and submitted the original invoice as evidence. The defendant was represented by his lawyer, and his wife also attended the hearing. The defendant's lawyer argued that the piano was the property of the defendant's father, as evidenced by a letter from the defendant's father, which he presented to the court. The court noted that both sides had conflicting claims and ordered an adjournment to the 9th, summoning the piano store to present its account books for further investigation.</p>

<p>Gao Weixiaofu (34 years old), a German Jewish lawyer who had been practicing law in Shanghai for many years, suddenly died of illness at the Ewo Hospital on Route Albert last month. Gao had established a law firm at 12 Rue du Consulat with Tian O'wen, a lawyer of the same nationality, and Shi Jiutang, a Chinese lawyer. Since Gao had no family in Shanghai, the French police considered that the inheritance of Gao's estate was problematic. Therefore, the police dispatched personnel to temporarily seal the law firm the day before yesterday. However, lawyers Tian and Shi claimed that Gao had made a will when he was ill, voluntarily giving the estate to Tian and Shi to inherit. The police, after learning the situation, found it inconvenient to handle and transferred the case to the 8th Division of the Second Special District Court yesterday, requesting a resolution. Lawyers Tian and Shi then presented the will and other documents. After questioning by Judge Zhu, the court ruled that the estate of the deceased Gao Weixiaofu should be temporarily entrusted to Shi Jiutang and Tian O'wen for safekeeping. The issue of inheritance will be determined by the Civil Division separately.</p>

<p>The "Shanghai Mainichi Shimbun," a Japanese newspaper in this city, reported yesterday that the New World Company would be transferred to Japanese ownership. As the matter seemed bizarre, the reporter visited the company's management. According to the person in charge, the company has been operating with success for many years and is currently actively expanding its business. The section about the transfer reported in the "Shanghai Mainichi Shimbun" is completely untrue.</p>

<p>This city has been shrouded in wind and rain for several days. Yesterday's weather was still extremely bad, with rain and wind mixed together. The sky was also very gloomy. This kind of bad weather is influenced by the invasion of low pressure, and there is little hope of clearing up anytime soon.</p>

<p>(From a newspaper published in the 12th year of the Tongzhi reign of the late Qing Dynasty)</p>
<p>Disaster Relief and Food</p>
<p>Westerners use wheat and meat for famine relief because they are highly nutritious, allowing a small amount to go a long way. Beef and mutton are even better than pork. Meat contains about four to five times more nutrients than rice. If the meat is dried, its weight becomes even lighter; an ounce of dried meat is equivalent to half a peck of white rice. Calculated in this way, the price is not expensive. This shows that grain is difficult to provide adequately, while meat is easier. Moreover, transporting rice is cumbersome, while transporting meat is more convenient. The Westerners' argument is similar to He Xiaoshi's theory of meat porridge. People laugh at their ignorance. We are fortunate to live in prosperous times and do not experience famine years. We are simply grateful that we are not starving to death and do not worry about others' hunger. However, even a dwarf has compassion and does not forget others when eating. I often eat bean sprouts and have an epiphany. The small bean sprouts increase the amount of food. This could be a method for famine relief. So, I took 100 green bean sprouts of moderate length, peeled them, leaving the roots, and weighed them. They weighed 8 mace 2 fen 5 li. Then, I weighed 100 dry green beans with the skins on, and they weighed 9 fen 2 li 4 hao. The difference in weight is almost tenfold. If various beans are transported to disaster areas, sprouted with water, and used for famine relief, it would be quite convenient, because cultivation is easy and does not require the long delay of spring plowing and autumn harvesting. This idea seems useful, but after consulting with Mr. Xu Xiecun, an expert in science, and examining it closely using chemical methods, it turns out to be useless. The reason why bean sprouts are heavier than the beans themselves is not because they contain more nutrients, but because they contain water. If 8 mace 2 fen 5 li of green bean sprouts are dried and weighed, they only weigh 8 fen 5 li. The fixed weight of bean sprouts is actually lighter than that of the beans themselves. Even if you add 100 green bean skins and weigh them together, it is still only equal to the weight of dry beans. Bean sprouts have a lot of water, like bean soup. Talking about the river cannot quench thirst, and drawing a cake cannot satisfy hunger.</p>

<h3 id="e94">"Chinese Homeowners Should Sympathize with Chinese Refugees" <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>— Bu Ren</p>
<p>Since the iron gates of the French Concession were opened, we have seen notices in the newspapers informing tenants that "order has been restored in the area". However, the newspapers also tell us that opium dens and gambling houses are everywhere, and there are even tragedies of young girls being insulted in broad daylight. Tenants are naturally more aware of this than landlords, so "those entering and leaving are busier than before, but those entering the Concession are still more numerous than those entering Nanshi". For houses "without any remaining belongings", they "voluntarily give up the lease relationship". As for "rent arrears", landlords are naturally asked to admit their losses.</p>
<p>However, stranger things have happened. The owners of properties in the refugee areas are also demanding that people move out, with the intention of renting them out for a high profit. Their reason, one imagines, is that they also believe "order has been restored in the area." They are not urging people to pay rent arrears, but are simply asking them to move out, which seems quite polite to the refugees.</p>
<p>But please, homeowners, recall the time three years ago when Nanshi was tragically bombed, and Father Jacquinot worked hard to designate a refugee area. "The fact that half of the urban and rural areas of Nanshi were able to be preserved unharmed during the Sino-Japanese war was entirely due to the agreement of both the Chinese and Japanese governments to designate a part of Nanshi as a refugee area for the purpose of accommodating refugees." This half of the urban and rural areas that Father Jacquinot worked to preserve for the refugees is now being subjected to "demands to move out." Are they not ashamed?</p>
<p>"Chinese homeowners should sympathize with Chinese refugees, in order to demonstrate their due obligations." These words were seen in a letter from Father Jacquinot, a Frenchman. I can only put down my pen and sigh!</p>
<h3 id="e95">Written After the Poetry Recitation Conference <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>— Min Qiang</p>
<p>The Poetry Recitation Conference sponsored by the Xinglie Society was finally held on March 31st in the auditorium of the YWCA, thanks to the efforts of the members of the Xinglie Society. This is probably the first public poetry recitation conference in Shanghai since the start of the Anti-Japanese War. I boldly suggest that this poetry recitation conference was not as good as we expected, although we should not be overly demanding, precisely because this was the first public recitation conference sponsored by the Xinglie Society. However, after listening to it, I have to give the Xinglie Society my utmost care with my sincere heart that passionately loves the future of Chinese poetry recitation. Today, I will make a small contribution to the Xinglie Society based on what I felt after listening to it.</p>
<p>(1) Poetry should be closely linked to the lives of the broad masses. That is to say: poetry belongs to the masses, just as the country belongs to the masses. Therefore, we should not charge too high a fee for poetry recitation conferences. The standard of fees should be based on the living standards of the general public, and the fees should be reduced as much as possible so that ordinary people have the opportunity to participate in "reciting poetry", so as not to create the impression that "poetry recitation" is the property of the bourgeoisie. The fee for this poetry recitation conference was four jiao across the board. I think this fee is a bit too high. I hope that the fee for the next poetry recitation conference will be at least half of this one.</p>
<p>(2) I felt that the poems recited this time placed too much emphasis on long poems, and short poems were pitifully few. In terms of recitation technique, the climaxes and low points lacked force, especially in Ms. Guan Lu's recitation, which had the same poetic tide from beginning to end.</p>
<p>(3) The poetry recited this time, as the representative of the Xinglie Society said in his speech, "We have not yet reached the goal of popularization." This is the most important issue in reciting poetry. Poetry and the living language cannot be separated, and those who work hard on "poetry movement" cannot ignore this point.</p>
<p>(4) Regarding the language used for recitation, it is best to use Mandarin. Although I am not opposed to the recitation of local languages, because Mandarin is still not very popular in various places. But in Shanghai, the recitation of poetry, apart from the Shanghai language, should be mainly in Mandarin. For example, at this poetry recitation conference, someone recited in Shantou dialect, which immediately caused most of the audience to make noises of disapproval, indicating that they could not understand it.</p>
<p>Finally, I hope that those who work hard on "poetry movement" and the members of the Xinglie Society will work hard to put into practice your declaration: "From this kind of recitation movement, from the reintegration of poetry with the living language, a new life of poetry will be produced."</p>

<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 22: News Articles Fly from Abroad; Superstitions and Beliefs Among People</p>
<p>Shao Huihua was secretly amused when she heard this. She thought: People say that women have a husband-praising addiction, and some have a son-praising addiction. Miss Qu Wushuang can be considered a person with a newspaper-praising addiction. But she is indeed a loyal person to the newspaper, and only with loyal people to the newspaper can the newspaper develop. Wu Junsu said, "Then are all the writing gentlemen living in the newspaper office?" Qu Wushuang said, "Some live in the newspaper office, and some do not live in the newspaper office. The same is true for the editors. Those who live in the newspaper office have dormitories on the sixth floor, which are quite comfortable. For those who do not live in the newspaper office, the newspaper office has cars to pick them up, or some of the writing and editing gentlemen have their own cars, so there is not much problem even if they go back late at night. Only those who live in the newspaper office have their housing provided by the newspaper office, but they take care of their own meals. Whether you like Western food or Chinese food, it is available here, just tell the kitchen. And if you want to play games and relax, there is a small garden, a small ball field, and a fitness room on the roof, all equipped. What is particularly convenient is that there is also a library on the sixth floor. This library is not open to the public, but is exclusively for the browsing of people in the newspaper office. The books are of course not as many as in the large libraries outside, but there is one thing, all kinds of magazines published all over the world, as well as all the magazines published in China, are complete." She also pointed to the bookshelves in the writing room and said, "These are just a few reference books. When writing articles, they often need to be consulted, so they are placed at hand. Besides, if you need any books, you can go to the library to borrow them. So there are two people who like to read books and magazines, and often bury themselves in the library all day long." Wu Junsu said, "Yes! Then it is very comfortable and pleasant to come here as an editor or writer! Shao Huihua laughed and said, "Sister Junsu! Don't just envy us. I advise you to change your career! After you finish your studies at Soochow University, don't be a university professor. We two will recommend you to come here as a newspaper reporter! You can be an editor or a writer, whichever you want." Wu Junsu said, "Let me ask you! Why don't you live in the newspaper office, but just jump in and out and run around everywhere?" Qu Wushuang shook her hand and laughed and said, "Forget it! If you want her to sit here quietly for a day, she will feel uncomfortable all over. One day, she also ran to the library, ready to read books. She flipped through this book and that book, and flipped through more than 20 foreign magazines. Everyone said, "You are just like a child, just looking at pictures." And what she looks at are just magazines about sports, swimming, riding, and boating. Those are all books that our writing gentlemen don't want to read." (258)</p>
<h3 id="e97">What I Saw on the Street <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>I happened to see a child in an alleyway, not yet ten years old, with tattered clothes, a metal ring hanging from one ear, and a cigarette in his mouth. He then used two little fingers to pluck off a section of the cigarette butt at the corner of his mouth, and flicked off the ash so lightly and nimbly, which was enough to make me marvel and call it a "prematurely old" experience. Where did he learn it from! There are many children, that's what I also see on the street. One kind of weightlifting is simply unbearable to look at. They use one forefinger to touch the tip of their noses, shake their bodies twice, shrug their shoulders a few times, shrug out a cunning and violent grimace, and when they jam a small fist into the waist of a companion, they add a very crisp sentence: "The color is here!"</p>
<p>Many people must have seen this kind of image, but few have ever spoken or written about such things. It can be said bluntly that knowledgeable people also have a place for passive encouragement. I am sweating for the society ten years from now!</p>

<p>The concepts we hold about things, objects, and people are very important, especially about people. The reason why it is important is because these concepts not only relate to ourselves, but also relate to others to some extent. A person who accepts the opinions of others will inevitably be blessed or harmed according to the level of those opinions. Since our opinions are related to people, or say that we hold a kind of concept about people, if that person's position is important, the influence generated by our concept will be greater. What if the person we are talking about is Jesus? Then our water life simply relies on the concept we hold about him. Speaking of the concepts we often hold about Jesus. First let us see what other people's thoughts are like. Even if we do not fully agree with their thoughts, it is still somewhat beneficial to us. When the reputation of Jesus spread everywhere, Jesus returned home from outside. He confidently walked into the chapel to teach people. What did the listeners think of him at that time? They listened to Jesus' words and said angrily, "Isn't this the son of Joseph? Isn't he a carpenter?" They casually said "Jesus is a carpenter", 　 they never thought that this sentence precisely shows that this Galilean who came from humble origins - Jesus had astonishing development. In their minds, they 　 never thought that this Jesus would use the materials of life to build a temple for God to live in. They only used the eyes of ordinary people to look at Jesus, thinking that he was just a neighbor who worked with a knife and a compass. Their first concept was that Jesus was uneducated. Jesus did not go to school to study, and in terms of literature, he was naturally inferior to the scholars of the time. However, this concept is not entirely correct either. If it were correct, why would people all over the world flock to him so madly? Although this kind of question often floated up in people's hearts, they still believed in him, because they felt a new kind of inspiration in their hearts after listening to Jesus' doctrines. What is the reason? Because this Jesus, who did not go to school, had the wisdom to know people, and could spiritually explain the value of life. How much better is a person than a sheep? Better to an incomparable degree. The shepherd gives his life for the lost sheep, and Jesus wants to give his life for those who have lost their lives because of sin.

<h3 id="e100">Children's Films Around the World <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>— Toad</p>
<p>United States: The United States is originally the most developed country in the film industry, but its emphasis on children's films has only been in the last four years. In addition to the children's cinemas established by various state and local governments, there has been a greater effort to produce children's films for schools. To date, every elementary school in the United States has one or more film projectors.</p>
<p>England: In recent years, England has gradually attached importance to children's films. A national children's film censorship board has been specially organized to review various films. Films that are suitable for children's education are marked with the letter "A" and shown in children's cinemas throughout the country. At the same time, film companies are encouraged to produce children's films.</p>
<p>France: French children's films focus on biographies (such as Joan of Arc) and science films. Every Sunday or holiday, there are often children's film mobile units showing films in various villages. Moreover, every July 14th, a children's film discussion conference is held in Paris, attended by school principals, film industry employees, news reporters, parents, etc.</p>
<p>Germany: Germany is the first country to pay attention to children's films, with the government, families, and film industry employees working together. Usually, regardless of what films are being shown, children are strictly forbidden from entering the cinema. However, on Sundays, all cinemas show children's educational films, such as "Hindenburg" and "The Great Literary Figure Goethe," specifically for children to watch, and no tickets are charged.</p>
<p>Italy: It can be said that Italy pays the most attention to children's films. In addition to establishing free children's cinemas and promoting school educational films, it has also stipulated various regulations for censorship, and all expenses are borne by the state. The subjects of children's films are all focused on science, history, customs, industry, and fascism.</p>
<p>Netherlands: The Netherlands prohibits children from watching detective, romance, and horror films. When "Snow White" was shown in various parts of the Netherlands a few years ago, it was banned for children under the age of sixteen because of its excessive horror elements.</p>
<h3 id="e101">### "Xi Shi" <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>— Juan</p>
<p>The Yilin Drama Society will stage the three-act play Xi Shi at the Carlton Theatre at 10:00 a.m. on April 7th, directed by Gu Ruozhi. I would like to write some thoughts before watching Xi Shi: From a very young age, I knew that there was a woman in China during the "Spring and Autumn Period" who was the embodiment of beauty. Her name was Xi Shi. It is said that Xi Shi was from Luoluo Village, Luoluo Mountain, Zhuji County, Zhejiang Province. The big one is the "Washer Woman." It's very strange, her washing place is in Hangzhou. Many years ago, I traveled to Hangzhou and remembered that there was an alley called Washing Alley on the way from the West Lake to the Gongyuan, which was divided into east and west sections by the road. Speaking of Xi Shi's deeds, it seems that she really existed, but some people think that she is a legendary figure. How does Gu Ruozhi write the script? I don't know, but I really have some prejudices. Indeed, the script of such a protagonist must be poetic. I agree with Shao Xunmei's opinion that it should be a poetic drama?</p>
<p>Shao Xunmei, in a conversation with someone, expressed his wish to write this script: "Xi Shi, if there really is such a person, her intelligence and ability can be believed, but we must not forget that she is a 'person'. At the same time, we must also understand the personality of Fu Chai. With such a beauty matched with such a hero, I think the story will not be so simple. Fu Chai has also suffered hardships. Would such a wise and brave hero become mentally confused upon seeing the beauty presented by the enemy country? Xi Shi is cultivated. Would such an emotional beauty be so hard-hearted and so cruel to the hero who is in love with her? Really, before writing this script, you must know that Xi Shi is a person, two ordinary 'people! Not a superman'!" So she has advantages and disadvantages, and she is definitely not a "hero"! At the same time, you must also know what kind of person Fu Chai is! What kind of personality!</p>
<p>Shao Xunmei's opinion, I think, is worth considering and discussing for those who write Xi Shi!</p>
<h3 id="e102">Lovely "Fragrant Concubine" <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>— Ji Ping</p>
<p>Recently, people who pay attention to the domestic film industry have expressed various opinions on "fashion films" and period films. In my opinion, it is only necessary to ask whether the film itself is "good" or "bad," and there is no need to argue about "fashion" versus "ancient." A "beautiful" film is good whether it is a fashion film or a period film; a "bad" film is not good whether it is a fashion film or a period film. However, filmmakers should take both sides into account to regulate the tastes of the audience. It is not feasible to blindly favor "ancient" and neglect "fashion," as is the case now.</p>
<p>Yesterday, I watched the premiere of "Fragrant Concubine" and felt very satisfied. I have seen many period films, and I think "Fragrant Concubine" is a superb work. We always feel that the plot awareness of domestic films is better than that of foreign films, while the production technology of domestic films is worse than that of foreign films. However, the directing techniques, photography, and sound recording of "Fragrant Concubine" are all excellent, and it can be called the best of domestic films. Hu Tiwei's script for "Fragrant Concubine" is still his debut work, but the entire plot is organized with enthusiasm and tension, and loyalty lasts forever, which shows that he is full of brocade and embroidery and deserves admiration. In terms of actors, Wang Xichun, Tu Guangqi, and Chen Qi are all competent, and others are also above average. The two branches and Mongolian music, ancient music, etc., are very encouraging to listen to. It can be said that it is extremely exciting to perform this play at this time and place.</p>

<h3 id="e104">"Sanban" is the Most Difficult to Sing (Part 1) <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>— Su Shaoqing</p>
<p>Many people who like to sing Pi Huang gather together and raise the question of which type of singing is the most difficult. Some say it is the slow tempo, some say it is the fast tempo, some say it is Fan Erhuang, and some say it is the tight singing of the Liushui Ban. I say no. All singing, no matter what country or what kind of music, is the most difficult to sing well compared to songs without tempos, that is, "Sanban." In the early years of the Republic of China, I learned opera in Beijing and met the American musician Wei Xiqin (Chinese name, originally German, American, liked to study Oriental music, and regarded the Chinese Guqin as the world's number one musical instrument). He said: "The best melody in the world is one that does not use beats. This kind of music only exists in India." At that time, I was friends with Mr. Wu Ji'an, and I learned Kunqu from him. I used the "Sanban" of Kunqu to prove that China also has music without beats. I sang it to him and asked him how it compares to Indian music without beats. He said: "Although it seems to have no beats, it actually has rhythm. It is not as free as Indian music, but it can be ranked second in the world of music." I sang several sections of Pi Huang "Sanban" again, and he said that it was similar to Kunqu "Sanban," a similar type of music. The "Sanban" of Pi Huang is modeled after Kunqu, and its taste is originally the same. Why is Sanban difficult to sing? The difficulty lies in having rhythm without a beat. Mr. Wei Xiqin is right. Singing "Sanban" is not restricted by the rhythm of the beat, and you can give full play to your true emotions, and in the middle, it naturally becomes a chapter, and there is an interesting correspondence between the beginning and the end, and it is not aimless.</p>
<p>Letter to the Editor</p>
<h3 id="e105">Hoping That Colleagues in the Entertainment Industry Will Support the "Children's Library" <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>Dear Editor: Here is an opinion letter regarding the establishment of a children's library, please disclose it publicly: "The two sons of Mr. Ying Yongyu initiated the establishment of a 'Children's Library', which has been prepared by the Children's Day Preparatory Committee, and is now working hard to proceed. Shanghai is the only large city in our country with a population of millions. It is an extremely important and beneficial task to plan and establish a library for the welfare of children and to increase their opportunities for knowledge. I hope that colleagues in the entertainment industry will all help the 'Children's Library' raise funds, such as donations from myself and publicity, etc., the effect will definitely be great. I also hope that the Children's Day Preparatory Committee will formulate other measures to reward donations, stipulating that anyone who donates more than ten yuan will, in addition to issuing a receipt and sending a commemorative badge, also have the donor's name engraved on a commemorative碑 and stay in the馆 as a permanent memento. Those who donate more than one hundred yuan will, in addition to the above measures, also have the donor's photo hung in the馆. Those who donate more than one thousand yuan will have a reading room named after them as a permanent memento, for example, if Mr. Ying Yongyu donates one thousand yuan, a 'Yongyu Reading Room' will be set up in the library, and the more donations, the more reading rooms there will be. There are many people in Shanghai who are enthusiastic about children's welfare. I think that if colleagues in the entertainment industry come out to promote it, the future achievements will be even more impressive. Respectfully wishing you well, Feng Jun bows."</p>
