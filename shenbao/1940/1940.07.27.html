<h3 id="c2">黃金未來之出路如何 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>自歐局擾攘，歐陸各國之黄金，爲求安全計,紛渡大西洋以入於美;及至本年七刀初,美國所存黄金，爲值已達二百萬萬美圓，如此鉅數，固將如何運用，如何價值乎？夫價值之發生，不始於有無，而始於多寡，萬物而盡人背有。或盡人皆無，則不成爲商品，不成爲交易，亦即無所謂價值。必也，或多或寡，有供有求，而價值始見。今大量黄金，爲美國所吸收，舉世皆窶人，而美國獨有黄金，獨爲富翁，是不但可危，亦且可憂。因之有懷疑及於黃金未來之價值者。當英財次斐禮浦赴美，與美財長摩根韜協定英美匯價時，遂有人以英國績付美國貸款，將使世界黄金幾全部集中美國，而以未來黄金價值究將如何爲問者。斐禮浦之答詞絕爲肯定，曰，渠對於黃金之將來價值，毫無疑問。</p>
<p>然在德人之觀察，則大有不然，德意志總匯報主筆溫士楚博士於其「由二千年前回顧」文中，力陳「因美國囤積巨量黄金之結果。世界之其餘各國除在經濟方面，抵制美國外，別無他法，美國自其黄金夢中驚醒發現欲以黄金購貨，但無人需要黄金矣。……最後乃將黄金融化，鑄成金器，爲駐外使館餐桌之用，而將華爾街改名為黃金街，此乃黃金源源流入美國之結局。」語極幽默調侃之致。彼又以為「人民將放棄其笨重之金條，無欲以金付款，而樂用銀行之鈔票及支票，僅照其入款所能購之貨額估定時值之數。此誠充極其量而想像方來之變態者也。雖然，所謂鈔票支票也著，所代表者爲何物，而入款也者，所收入者爲何款，估價也者，所估者爲何值？夫物物交换之得推行也，亦爲有現行之貨幣制度，而後衡量比重價定，估值，以有易無，以盈劑不足，方有交換之可言。否則一疋之布。一石之米．將依何種根據以爲交換耶！蓋物之不齊，物之情也；或相陪蓰．或相什伯，或相千萬，势不能比而同之，於是由供需而差額生，由交易而貴賤見。差額貴賤求其平衡，則必濟之以貨幣，用為媒介，而後交易之利便始見，發展可期。德人未嘗不稔知其故也；故摧毀金本位之後，亦必須有適當代替之本位，以供計算之用。銀銅鐵員，固未嘗不可以爲幣，然與金相差幾希，且金亦從銀銅鐵貝中比較而得之幣材也。於是有思參照蘇聯規模用「勞働」為本位矣。姑不論勞働本位能否行諸國際間，即以勞勳本質而論，有才力，有智力，有勞力，所費之力不等，所獲之報酬亦異，此中計算，更為複雜而繁瑣。故使經濟即勞動。能有劃時代的成就，但所謂勞働，究置於何種基準下，在德人亦尚在研究之中，有以知其匪易也。</p>
<p>原德人所以有推翻金本位之說，蓋憤世嫉俗，亦有所感而發也。當凡爾賽和約簽訂之後，戰勝者悉索戰敗國金銀寶物以去，今則德意志席捲中歐，有波丹荷比挪法六國之地，不為不廣也。而所得之金銀幾何，可觀於歐戰發生後，歐陸黄金不絕運美，至本年七月中，運美之黃金猶值三萬萬圓之鉅，然則德人雖勝，固羌無所獲也。而流入美境之黃金，在六月中經各國政府所封存者已有十六萬萬八千六百萬美元。其中屬於歐洲戰敗國所有之黄金，宜可由德設法引渡，而無如爲美政府所禁阻。德人欲使黄金不復成為歐陸各國貿易之媒介，此在當今德國權力之下，大有成爲事實之可能。然而德人亦明知國難重重，不但另覓一本位，有所不易；即時間亦必待德國勝英，金鎊崩潰之後，而後歐陸之金本位方可澄清，此則目前猶在未定之天。况極權國家之物物交换制度，固為「貧窮國家之凱歌」而能否永久推行盡利，尚難逆料。蓋如中國淪陷區自遭「統制」之後，備受其害。物物交换，限制綦嚴，農人出售無門，商人欲買不得，平時只須一副本錢者，今則非兩副三副本錢，不能販運一物矣。欲選择一較善於此之價格，有所不能矣。貨棄於地，積於市、莫能爲之疏宣矣。將來盛行於國際間，能不蹈此覆辙乎，孰得而逆覩之哉。</p>
<p>然爲德國計，以德國民族之優秀，組織完密，製品精美，即在金本位之制度下，亦不患無黄金之獲得，可斷其爲決非以獵取爲能，長此貧困之國也。况美國擁有之黄金，除英國之一部分外，其他各國之黃金，不復爲美國所吸收，蓋戰事已過去，所求於美國者自少，故待和平之後，勢將逐漸返還其本國，此其一。再則美國投資於德義及其占領諸國者約爲十萬萬七千一百萬美元，而此諸國投資於美國今被封鎖者則有二十三萬萬美元，超過一倍以上；何况瑞士再美國鉅頟之投資中，大部爲法人之財產，於是而知今集中於美國價值二百萬萬元之黄金，及至將來，固有不少自美國而仍流回本國，則又何患乎無黄金，此其二。</p>
<p>至於幣材之選用黄金，前人論列已詐，可不必重加檢討。惟美國自經此次大戰之後．勢必增加大量黄金之收入，黃金之人於美者愈多。即在世界各國所流通者愈少，未来之出路如何，碓乎其爲一大問題。雖德經濟部長芬克仍以「吾等不敢預言美國黃金之將來如何，但確信歐洲將來貨幣，不以黃金爲基礎」爲言。惟可信者，將来之幣制，當非今日以前之幣制，貨幣政策之是否仍行統制，抑恢復其自由，衡之物極必返之理．其爲有所改革整理可必也。中國如何應付變局固應有所準備，以期適應未来之環境，若斤斤於黄金之得失，則新幣，亦幣也，舊幣，亦幣也，等是幣也，黃金在未來之幣制度上，仍將保有相當之地位，惟未若目前之尊貴，是亦可能之現象而非意外也。</p>

<p>柏林　德國經濟部長芬克昨日接見維也納「東南雜誌」主筆費師爾、答覆費氏所提之六個問題、闡述德國對於新歐洲之經濟計劃、按芬氏除担任經濟部長外、幷兼國家銀行總裁、最近復奉戈林上將之命、起草戰後德國及歐洲之經濟機構之廣大計劃、故其談話至堪重視、茲詳紀於後、</p>
<p>（一）「新歐洲之一般經濟機構將爲如何」、芬氏答稱、「此次戰爭對於歐洲及國際經濟機構、將有重大之影響、吾等將來在各方面將與義大利密切合作、將以德義兩國經濟機構、改造歐洲經濟機構、推行吾等在戰前及戰時獲得經濟勝利之方法、而某中精力使其普遍」、</p>
<p>（二）「戰後歐洲貨幣之基礎如何」、芬氏答以此乃次要問題、最重要者仍爲經濟機構問題、倘機構確定、則貨幣基礎迎刃而解、當然德國馬克將佔優越位置、德國力量之增强、自必使馬克地位亦隨之更趨鞏固、馬克行使之區域本將大爲擴充、而德國現與各國之雙邊貿易協定及淸算協定、將變爲多邊貿易協定、及多方面之淸算協定、</p>
<p>（三）「歐洲新經濟制度之下、何種貨物將感缺乏、何種貨物將感過剩」、芬氏答稱、「歐洲缺乏若干產物、無可諱言、吾等決非一味自給自足、而必將歐洲經濟機構與世界經濟機構互相交織錯綜、以歐洲優質之工產品、向世界市塲換取原料、但有一種限制、卽吾等所控制之區域內、此種產物必須儘量充足、使其不必仰給外貨、關於此點、芬氏提及煤油、咖啡、茶、可可各項、芬氏力言在此次戰事中、德國原料狀况已大爲進步、將來戰事結束後、其所按制富源將爲前所未有、尤其以煤、鐵、材等項爲最、</p>
<p>（四）「新歐洲將以何種貨物輸往俄羅斯南北美及東亞、以及換取各該地之何種貨物、芬氏答稱、「吾等與蘇俄有廣大之貿易協定、德國以工業品換取蘇俄之原料、將來尙將有長足之進展、至於美國須視美國對國際貿易之態度而定、截至目前、美國對於德國貨物異常歧視、目其貿易政策、希望作全世界之　櫬國及輸出國、則德美貿易前途殊堪疑慮、吾等不敢預言美國黃金之將來如何、但吾等確信歐洲將來貨幣、不能再以黃金爲基礎、因貨幣之價値、應由國家之經濟法令規定之、不能以本身價値旦暮變更之黃金作本位、例如美國現欲愉出黃金、輸入貨物、則其美元價値亦必隨之影響、以言南美及東亞、吾等向來保持優良之貿易關係、吾等相信一俟英國之海盜行爲中止之後、此項貿易必有順利之發展、須知東亞市塲、因中日戰事大受影響、倘政局澄淸、則德國與中國之經濟關係、必將立卽有良好之進展、此種進展當亦爲日本所希望者也、</p>
<p>（五）德國之戰時財政如何」、芬氏答稱、「吾等籌措戰時之財政、一言以蔽之曰「工作」、吾等除工作所得外、決不浪費金錢、德國發行兌換券、此項兌換券卽爲德國貨幣之基礎、因貨價及工資之穩定、德國之公債幷無可慮、</p>
<p>（六）「戰時經濟如何改變爲平時經濟、是否將引起經濟恐慌」、芬氏之答覆異常樂觀、申稱、此項變遷以逐漸方式、不致引起若何困難、芬氏於是列舉未來歐洲經濟機構之發展如次、（一）與歐洲各國締結長期貿易協定、使德國成爲歐洲各國之安全市塲、同時使德國貨物在歐洲有推銷之較佳機會、（二）根據現存之淸算協定、擴而充之、建立各國間穩固的交換及淸算制度、（三）交換農江兩業之經騐、使歐洲原料之出產、建到最高峯、同時利用歐洲之經濟富源、提高歐洲人民之生活程度、使其無所恐慌任何外來之封鎖、（四）從經濟政策貨幣、貸款、生產、交易各方面、謀求密切之合作、使歐洲各國在經濟上團結一致、此項打成一片之歐洲經濟集團、將與其他國家根據平權原則進行交易、</p>
<p>芬氏最後中稱、　所草擬之平時經濟計劃、將保障德國經濟達到最高之安全、德國人民達到最高之消費、提高其生活程度、歐洲經濟卽將以此種目標加以改組云、（廿六日海通電）</p>

<p>洋米現貨雖低續降元外、而路現回　原包則已猛跌二元、緣六月二十六號裝暹邏二號米除已到一船外、聞建源愼記經手之二船八萬五千包與米業合訂之西貢米先到六萬包、均於昨今先後傍埠、浮多散囤莫不爭先脫手、行號客戶亦復盡力吐出、雖實力大戶尙圖堅持、而市價終難站足、上月二十六裝暹米開價六十元〇二角小至五十九元、現貨卽交五十九元二角及五十九元、西貢卽交祇開五十七元半、六月下七月上裝亦降開五十九元〇五分、市價雖已步趨而下、然人心尙未安定、蓋存多到湧、消化呆滯、後市似有續跌之趨勢、昨回籠成交四五百噸、現米約近四千包、</p>

<p>總董手續無可非議</p>
<p>據另一領事今晨稱、工部局總董以其致領袖領事之呼籲函公諸本市報界、竟遭日總領事三浦義秋之　議、要知工部局總董此舉、殊未可責難、日領所謂工部局總董此舉、手續不當云云、固非不確、然苟取不當步驟、實皆因近日內領事團不予工部局以協助所致、</p>

<h3 id="c113">有不是的父母 <a href="#c113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>— 編者</p>
<p>我們中國有過一句占老的話，叫做「天下無不是之父母」。這句不十分合理的武斷的話，不知道是那一位仁兄先說的。中國人提倡孝道，不能說是一件壞事；可是假如要子女肯定地去遵從父母不一定對的主見，而謂之提侶孝道：假如子女不服從父母一定不對的主見，就說子女「大逆不道」，這就未免有點不聰明了。</p>
<p>子女是人，父母也是人，世界上沒有一個十全十美的完人，是則安能有「無不是」的人，又安能說「天下無不是之父母」？</p>
<p>所以，天下不但有不是之子女，也有不是之父母。</p>
<p>要解決現代家庭的糾紛，我們必得先把家庭中的人，老老實實地都看做人，看做有缺點的人；不論吾做父母的，做子女的，都要虛心自省，都承認自己會「有不是」的時候，這是解決家庭糾紛的先決條件。</p>
<p>可是，「天下無不是之父母」這一句話，不幸早已深入人心了；我們要建立幸福和樂的家庭，必須先打倒道一句不合理的話。我們要承認：父母不一定對，子女不一定錯！</p>
<p>（末了，我們還得在這裡下一個多餘的注解，以免引起誤會：我們並不是說父母一定不對，子女一定不錯。）</p>

<h3 id="c114">「豬仔」 <a href="#c114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>— 吳劍芬</p>
<p>荷屬邦加島的中國礦工</p>
<p>「到南洋掘金去！」</p>
<p>中團人，出門時就僅那麼一捲的被蓆，一只盛着幾件襤褸衣穿的破篋，和一副肯摸肯吃苦的手脚；像一羽之鳥，翱翔於四方。一年，三年，五年，十年……當他們從熱帶的國土回到故園來，却不復是寒素的吳下阿蒙了：大白西裝穿得筆挺，好一派洋氣；行李塞滿了一屋子，誰知道那　面藏着幾許的珍玩財帛呢？這曾經嬴得歐洲人和土人們不少的驚奇和妬羨，一提起華僑，就由不得翹起大拇指：「喏喏，Orang仔！」雖說赤子暴富，在華僑中是件很普通的事，然而這是「得天獨厚」的幸運兒啊！另有一班華僑，過着非人的陰暗生涯，一生胼手胝足，到頭來還免不了貧病交侵，老死異疆。荷屬邦加島的豬仔」，那更是苦難的羣了。</p>
<p>邦加（Banka）係小一彈九小島，但它卻是世界有名的錫礦區；每年產量，多至三十萬　以上。由荷人設錫礦局（Tinwining）經營之，而礦工，則幾乎全是華僑。他們都是閩粤的同胞，在香港，先和該公司的負責　關訂立契約：賣身三年或五年不等，每日工資祇有四十仙之譜。這便是所謂「契約工人」，亦卽所謂「豬仔」</p>
<p>待遇是那樣菲薄，而工作，自晨至昏，却不容許你有一刻的憩息，好像他們都是、永不會感到疲乏的鐵人似地；飯食又糙劣到無以復加：兩碗黃米飯，一小碟鹹菜，半條腐味的鹹魚，和餵給豬的一樣。正如魯迅先生所說：「喫約是草，擠的却是牛乳。」稍一怠慢，那班監工就拳足齊飛，在以前，給毆撻到死亡的，也毫不爲奇。生命就像小草一樣地猥賤，在驕陽下枯黃了，在踐躂下萎絕了。</p>
<p>在礦塲的鄰近，賭局和妓館林立，礦工們背鄕離井，工作後無以爲遣，况且又缺少高尙的娛樂，因而羣趨於嫖賭兩途。試想一月的汗血的代價，只有荷幣十幾盾，怎經得起這樣揮霍呢？所入不敷所耗，於是乎向監工借高利貸，債臺越築越高，越無力淸償了。於是乎年復一年地糧續賣身傭工，像背負着重壓的駱駝，永遠走不完艱辛的大漠。不少人，終於見不到自由的陽光，在礦穴中直掙扎到死。</p>
<p>近年來，雖說錫礦局對於礦工的待遇，略有改善；然而由於不景氣的在潮的襲擊，礦工們却更不能立足了。一方面，生活程度高漲；另一方面，爪哇土人以「工資低廉」爲號召，源源地走人礦塲，實行其推，踢，擠的策略。一批批的華工，在傾軋下失了業，躑躅在異國的十字街頭了。</p>
<p>「　！到南洋　金嗎？」於歸國的輪中，一位來自邦加島的閩籍礦工，噴着一嘴的唾沫，對我訴說着他們的不幸和憤慨：「像我們那簡直是到南洋去掘自己的墳墓呀！」</p>
<p>我用憐憫和慰　的眼光望着他，默默地說不出話來，眼前晃動着一團團飢餓的黑臉，一堆堆的荒墳，一幅　絕人寰的陰暗的畫圖！</p>

<p>霍桑探案</p>
<h3 id="c117">舞后的宿 <a href="#c117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>— 程小青著</p>
<p>第四章　　種推想</p>
<p>倪金壽忽辯駁道：「祇有三個啊—陸健笙，余甘棠，趙伯雄。還有誰？一</p>
<p>霍桑重新走到圓桌旁邊的椅子上坐下。「還有李芝範的兒子，就是伊的表兄。」</p>
<p>「這個人似乎關係很小。據老毛說，他前犬十七日來的，昨天早晨就去，似乎不會有多大關係。」</p>
<p>「對，不過在前天下午王　蘭跟他談話的時候，伊不　趙伯　和這位表兄見面，可見伊和這表兄也有某種關係。此外也許還有第五，第六個人，我們還不知道。因爲根據昨夜半夜時的情形，說不定還有一個不知誰何的關係人。」</p>
<p>金壽問題：「你可是根據　老毛的說話，他說聽不出這男客的聲音？」</p>
<p>霍桑點頭道：「是的，這是一個根據。伊昨天明明是故意將老毛差開去看戲的。假使伊昨夜的會的人，就是我們所知道的四個人中的一個，伊也用不着避老毛的　睛。對不對？」</p>
<p>金　果然點點頭。「對，這倒尷尬。這第五個人眼前沒有一些兒頭緒。」</p>
<p>霍桑繼續說：「第二，我們再推想昨夜伊回來的時間。昨夜初夏時的悶熱，十點　光景，天下雨了。到了十一點半以後，雨勢更大、看那泥鞋印，伊是在十一點半大雨以後回來的。第三，我們冉推想伊回來後的行動。伊進來以後，分明直接進這會客室來，即然不會上樓，也沒有再到外面去；這是從伊的單程的高跟鞋印上可以知道的。同時從三個—甲，乙和伊自己　　泥印的層次上看，伊最先進來，其次是乙印客，又次是甲印客。所以伊是第一個進來，進來時一定不會將大門鎖好，分明伊要等候什麽預約的人來。」</p>
<p>金壽連連點頭：「不錯，如果鎖了門，那客人進來時，伊又須出去開門，那末伊自己也應當有兩行進入的足印了。」</p>
<p>霍桑自願自說：「伊回來不久，那個預的的客人大　也就到了。這可以從伊的不曾上樓和高跟鞋都沒換掉兩點上推想而知。那客人來了以後，伊就　意招待，但瞧桌子上酒杯中的香檳餘酒和煙灰盆中的煙尾，也就可見一班。劇者毛說，他們談話的窗簾下　。昨夜氣候很悶熱，伊所以關窗遮帘，也可證實這來客不但不是四個人中之一，還有　格的秘密性。」（五七）</p>
<h3 id="c118">上帝與人類的痛苦 <a href="#c118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>人類因爲自私自利的緣故，造出了許多痛苦。販賣奴隸的，將人看做物件一樣，彼此買來買去，對於奴隸的虐待　答，簡直比待牛馬還要苛刻。拐騙婦女的，拆散別人的　庭，離散別人的骨肉，威逼那被拐騙的婦女，苦度地獄的生活，還有無數的窮人，　　入的欺壓　取，呻　喘息，其痛苦眞是形容難盡。一般擁有房產的房主們，屋上加　，樓上加樓，只知自己有房租可得，別人住在鴿　裏，所受的痛苦，則漠不關心。更有　多盜匪，橫行不法，終日以刦掠爲生，以致常有良民，遭遇　來的橫　，輕則財物　搶，重則生命被戕，弄得家破人亡。除此以外，還有）種最大痛苦，　是戰爭，無論　麼地方，只要一有戰事，痛苦就接踵而至，雙方敵對的軍隊，固然免不了要有許多生命，葬送在槍林彈雨之中，而無辜的人民，也免不了池魚之殃，在亞洲的戰塲上，戰事延長了三年，還沒結束，而歐洲的戰事，又是夜長夢多，不知伊於胡底？到處屍骸　　，　肉橫飛，楓火連天，哀　　野，人類的痛苦，可說沒有比這再大的了。</p>
<p>因此，就常有許多人說：宇宙之間，沒有上帝。卽使有上帝，這位上帝，也不像基督徒所說的是人類的天父。他對於人類的痛苦，並不注意。再退一步說，即使　有上帝，而這位上帝，也眞是人類的天父，但他對於人問的罪惡，却是無力阻止，對於人類的痛苦，也沒有甚麼安　。</p>
<p>我們猛然聽這幾句話，似乎很有見地，其實則大　不然！上帝對於！上間的罪　，果　無力阻止嗎？我們相信各國所有的警察局，司法機關，以及公正　論，都是上帝幫助人撲滅罪惡的武器。上帝對於人類所受的痛苦，更是常在關心，各國所有的紅十字會，　孺救濟院，育嬰堂，濟良所，難民收容所，都是上帝感動他自己的完女，所給與受苦　難者的安慰。世界上若沒有這些慈善機關，試問人類所受的痛苦，又將如化呢？如是我們怎能說上帝與人類的痛苦是漠不相關的？又怎能說人類不必承認有上帝呢？（八月一，日再登）</p>

<p>— 鈞陶</p>
<p>大凡有傷風化有礙國體的影片，在任何各國都遭到普遍地禁映的。有時目為各國外交的立場或政治性民族性的關係，往往某一類的影片，在某一國亦有禁映的可能性。今述其大概情形如下：</p>
<p>蘇聯除了一二張有特殊意義之影片外，大概美國的影片都在禁映之列。所以至今能在蘇聯放映之影片，只有『白雪公主』『怒火之花』等三數張。</p>
<p>意大利對於有關離婚的影片嚴禁放映。即使一張很有意義的片子，只要有一點說到離婚，不是禁映就遭剪刀之殃。</p>
<p>如果一張影片中有一個演員是猶太人，那末不論你是怎樣一張片子，在德國都遭禁映的。好像『垂簾六十年』本是一張很好的宮闈片。就是因為裏面有了一個猶太演員的關係，所以在德國至今不能放映。</p>
<p>在墨西哥禁映描寫牧人和印地安人的片子。因為墨西哥人很多牧人，而且他們種族上和印地安人亦稍有關係。所以他們以為這類片子是一種侮辱片！</p>
<p>凡是在英國的屬地和殖民地上，有損白種人的威嚴的片子是禁映的。即租界亦在此例。</p>
<p>挪威丹麥等國禁映有酷刑和强盜的片子，他們以為這種片子能影響他們人民的心理。所以對于有損教育性的影片，查禁尤嚴。</p>

<p>— 唯我</p>
<p>高慶奎過去曾經像現在的馬連良一樣紅過，他也是京朝派伶人第一流的紅角兒，不幸後來嗓音失潤，一字不出，以致不能再粉墨登場，因此這一位第一流的紅角兒，在環境支配下退休了。直到現在，竟以教戲為主。</p>
<p>最近黃金大戲院方面，已發表接毛世來後隊的下屆角色是鬚生李盛藻，坤旦童芷苓，武生高盛麟這一批人。因為盛藻是慶奎的女婿，盛麟是慶奎的長子，所以黃金當局連想到這位晚境不佳的藝人，而去函邀請慶奎隨其子婿來滬，照料一切，順便可以替盛藻排幾齣高派傑作。現在慶奎已允南來，屆時絕響歌壇已久之『贈縷袍』『哭秦庭』等劇，勢必又　　與吾人相見，亦佳音也。</p>
<p>至於李盛藻一局之配角，相當齊整，坤旦童芷苓，為荀慧生之得意弟子，花容月貌，扮相秀麗，惟黃金當局，因童伶從夫南來，猶不敢貿然相邀，故旦角一席，有改邀坤旦馬艷之說，按馬艷芬為馬氏三艷中最佳之一人，與童芷苓較，艷芬自勝一籌。此外武生為高盛麟，花臉為袁世海，丑角為茹富蕙，裏子老生為貫盛習，皆富連成之高材生，亦皆滬人所熟知，恕不贅。惟此中之小生一角，原定江世玉，茲以世玉不克來滬，黃金當局已改邀茹富蘭矣。按茹富蘭為富連成之唯一武小生，出科後改應武生，演『探莊』『夜奔』『戰濮陽』『八大錘』等戲，南北允推之為第一人。葉盛蘭之武戲，戲路與富蘭同，蓋盛蘭之武戲，皆富蘭所授也。富蘭之武生戲，或在孫毓堃之上，第以目患近視，影響演戲，因復改應小生，要為不可多得之才。此次能隨盛藻南來獻藝，滬人可謂眼福不淺，爰為介紹如上。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Roosevelt Announces New Licensing System to Prevent Gasoline and Scrap Iron Shipments to Japan; Japanese Military Actions in China Greatly Struck; US Maritime Commission Forbids Oil Tankers to Sail to Japan <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Washington – President Roosevelt announced last night the implementation of an embargo on US oil and scrap iron to foreign countries. Simultaneously, the Federal Maritime Commission announced that it had refused to approve American oil tankers to Japan. President Roosevelt's order extends export license controls to oil and scrap iron. The most affected will be Japan, Germany, and Italy. This move will prevent private companies in the United States from violating the moral embargo launched by the government against selling key war materials to Japan and the Axis powers. From now on, the transport of oil and scrap iron will require a State Department license. The government previously adopted this method to stop supplying American aircraft and other war materials to Japan. The Maritime Commission announced yesterday that it had refused to allow American oil tankers to join the Japan freight route, as the government's new policy only permits American oil tankers to travel within the Western Hemisphere. The Maritime Commission and the Treasury Department had previously prohibited American oil tankers from transporting oil to Spain, claiming that the area was "very dangerous." However, observers pointed out that the Atlantic coast of Spain and Portugal is outside the dangerous zone designated by the US Neutrality Act. Therefore, many believe that Britain opposed American oil shipments to Spain because it feared that such shipments might be diverted to the Axis powers. Officials stated that Britain might have threatened some disadvantage to this transportation. President Roosevelt included oil and scrap iron in the list of war necessities and imposed an embargo, accepting the requests of numerous American groups opposing American aid to Japan's invasion of China. Observers are particularly interested in this matter because it occurred within a month of Colonel Stimson joining President Roosevelt's mixed cabinet as Secretary of War. It is recalled here that Colonel Stimson was one of the initiators of the "American Committee Against Japanese Aggression" and has consistently advocated for an embargo against Japan. Well-informed sources pointed out last night that this move is not entirely a reprisal against Japanese aggression, as the United States itself urgently needs these key raw materials after reorganizing its armed forces. (United Press dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>Washington – Since President Roosevelt announced an embargo on oil and iron to foreign countries yesterday, the United States has begun to wield its powerful economic weapons to contain some countries in need of war materials such as oil and iron. The United States imports the most scrap iron and oil to Japan. According to officials, this action by the United States is to reserve American oil, steel, and other metals for its own national defense. At the same time, American political circles strongly stated that this step by the United States is sufficient to serve as an active tool for the United States to consult with Japan on the Far East issue. The Japanese Embassy has openly requested the US State Department to inform them of the reasons for this order, but the State Department has not responded. (United Press dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>Hong Kong – Tokyo dispatch: A spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that the report that the United States intends to impose an embargo on Japan's scrap iron and petroleum is indeed a serious matter if true and will inevitably produce a significant reaction in Japan. (26th dispatch)</p>
<p>Roosevelt Governs Transportation</p>
<p>Washington – President Roosevelt has recently included oil, scrap iron, and other items in the list of goods that require special licenses to be transported out of the country. According to the President's secretary, this is not called an embargo, but it gives the authorities the power to control American transportation. However, newspapers all view this as equivalent to a ban, except for destinations that may be specially authorized by the government. (Reuters dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>Washington – The United States Congress has extended its giant economic fist to Japan, intending to embargo oil and metals as well as scrap iron. After the "May Act" authorized President Roosevelt to restrict or prohibit the export of various items needed for American rearmament, President Roosevelt issued an export control order on the 2nd of this month, listing several types of goods that would be subject to control. However, the aforementioned items were not included. Later, White House Secretary O'Reilly announced that these several items must be added to the original items listed. These changes have no bearing on Japan, but these new additions have a significant impact on Japan's ability to operate. According to Lieutenant Colonel Barnett of the Defense Advisory Committee's Export Control Office, the United States has not yet decided whether to completely prohibit or reduce the export of these important raw materials. Observers claim that the President's new move may be part of the government's policy to express American opposition to the recent terrorist incidents in Shanghai. Therefore, from the current situation, the United States' stance can be considered a potential threat to Japan, and the future course of American policy may also depend on subsequent changes. (International dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>Burma Road Blockade Incident Question Raised in British Parliament</p>
<p>London – Labour MP Morgan asked Under-Secretary Butler in the House of Commons yesterday whether the decision to block Burma and prevent the shipment of war materials into China would be revised if Japan continued to take actions unacceptable to the British government, such as infringing on British interests or prestige in the Far East, during the period of the Burma Road blockade agreement. Butler replied in writing that he had no reason to believe that the assumptions raised by Morgan reflected the intentions of the Japanese government, so he could not comment.

<p>Washington – Those concerned with Far Eastern affairs have expressed great satisfaction with the special license requirement for the export of oil and scrap iron. Regardless of the motive, everyone feels that the government's move, along with preventing oil tankers from sailing to Spain, is a blow to the aggressor countries. Observers believe that with the more important domestic events discussed in the party convention now over, the US President is focusing more attention on foreign affairs. People here are paying close attention to the remarks made by Japanese Prime Minister Konoe, considering them to be an expression of Japan's cautious actions in international events and not being swayed by sweet words. Konoe's attitude has not caused surprise here. Washington often does not attach as much importance to Japan's threats of taking active action as London does, believing that although important elements in Japan have the same ultimate goals, they are heading in different directions, and their opinions are still inconsistent. The unity of a totalitarian country that requires a political head of state to be obeyed without hesitation or thought is not yet possessed by Japan. (Reuters News Agency, 26th)</p>
<p>New York – The New York Times reported this morning that although the White House's order prohibiting the export of gasoline and iron scrap is also related to Germany and Italy, it is purely aimed at Japan. Its main purpose is to enable the US government to use economic weapons against Japan. Therefore, the political importance of this measure should be judged based on how the US government uses it. Japan's need for iron scrap is extremely urgent. Now that the US government has controlled it, it can be seen that the United States has decided to adopt a strict economic policy to deal with Japan and to respond to the anti-American tendencies that the new Japanese government will launch. Therefore, prohibiting the export of gasoline and iron scrap is an effective threat. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>Active Means of Aiding China</p>
<p>Chongqing – Chinese sources here have welcomed the news that the United States has decided that the export of oil and scrap iron requires licenses, interpreting this decision as an active means adopted by the United States to aid China's war of resistance. The United States did not adopt an embargo because it feared that its implementation might cause domestic opposition before the presidential election. It is generally believed that this new licensing system will prevent the continued shipment of oil and scrap iron from the United States to Japan. Chinese sources pointed out that the United States has been Japan's largest supplier of oil and iron in the past three years, greatly assisting Japan's military actions in China, especially the supply of gasoline for aircraft and mechanized units, and the supply of scrap iron needed for the manufacture of bombs and military industries. Both overseas Chinese and Chinese people in China have appealed to the US authorities to stop supplying Japan with oil and iron. Currently, not only is the Chinese side expressing joy at the decision made by the United States, but some well-informed sources also believe that this licensing system may further suggest that the negotiations currently underway in Washington are progressing smoothly.

<p>Japanese Ship Tatsuta Maru Seized</p>
<p>Xiangshan – The Japanese mail ship Tatsuta Maru, carrying 550 passengers, was scheduled to sail to Japan yesterday. It is currently docked in the port and has not yet received permission from US officials to leave. It is not yet known whether the US authorities are preventing the ship from departing or whether there are other reasons for detaining it. Some people, given President Roosevelt's issuance of the oil and iron embargo order, believe that the ship may have been detained. The ship is currently carrying scrap iron, cotton, machinery, machine oil, and rubber. According to Heibert, the assistant tax collector of the customs, the Japanese ship has not yet departed because he has not received an order from Washington allowing the ship to leave. He also pointed out that due to Treasury Secretary Morgenthau's recent announcement, every ship must obtain official permission before leaving an American seaport. (United Press dispatch, 26th)</p>

<h3 id="e2">What is the Future of Gold? <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Since the unrest in Europe, the gold of various European countries has crossed the Atlantic to the United States for safety. By the beginning of July this year, the value of gold stored in the United States had reached 20 billion US dollars. How will such a huge number be used and valued? The occurrence of value does not begin with existence or non-existence, but with quantity. If everything is possessed by everyone, or if everyone has nothing, then it will not become a commodity, a transaction, or what is called value. It is necessary to have either abundance or scarcity, supply and demand, before value can be seen. Now, a large amount of gold has been absorbed by the United States. The world is full of paupers, and the United States alone has gold, alone is rich. This is not only dangerous but also worrying. Therefore, there are doubts about the future value of gold. When British Finance Minister Philipps went to the United States to negotiate the British-American exchange rate with US Treasury Secretary Morgenthau, some people asked how the future value of gold would be, given that Britain's payment of loans to the United States would concentrate almost all the world's gold in the United States. Philipps' answer was absolutely affirmative, saying that he had no doubt about the future value of gold.</p>
<p>However, in the observation of Germans, it is very different. Dr. Winster, the chief writer of the German General Exchange Report, in his article "Looking Back from Two Thousand Years Ago," strongly stated that "as a result of the United States hoarding a huge amount of gold, the rest of the world has no other way but to resist the United States economically. The United States wakes up from its gold dream and finds that it wants to buy goods with gold, but no one needs gold... Finally, it melts the gold and casts it into gold utensils for the tables of foreign embassies, and renames Wall Street as Gold Street. This is the end of the gold flowing into the United States." His language is extremely humorous and satirical. He also believes that "people will abandon their heavy gold bars, have no desire to pay with gold, and be happy to use bank notes and checks, only valuing them based on the amount of goods that their deposits can buy. This is indeed a transformation that fully imagines the extreme. However, what do these so-called bank notes and checks represent, and what is deposited in these deposits, and what is the value of the valuation? The promotion of barter is also due to the current monetary system, and then the weight and price are determined, valued, in order to exchange what is lacking for what is abundant, and only then can there be exchange. Otherwise, what basis will be used for exchanging a bolt of cloth for a stone of rice! The inequality of things is the nature of things; or they are doubled, or ten times, or hundreds, or thousands, and they cannot be compared and made the same. Therefore, differences arise from supply and demand, and value is seen from transactions. To balance these differences and values, it is necessary to use currency as a medium, and then the convenience of transactions can be seen, and development can be expected. Germans have never failed to know this; therefore, after destroying the gold standard, there must also be an appropriate substitute standard for calculation. Silver, copper, iron, and shells have never been impossible to use as currency, but they are almost indistinguishable from gold, and gold is also obtained from silver, copper, iron, and shells through comparison. Therefore, there is a thought to refer to the Soviet model and use "labor" as the standard. Not to mention whether the labor standard can be implemented internationally, even in terms of the nature of labor, there is talent, intelligence, and labor, the effort spent is unequal, and the rewards obtained are also different. The calculation in this is even more complicated and tedious. Therefore, even if the economy is labor, and can have epoch-making achievements, but what kind of benchmark is the so-called labor placed under? The Germans are still researching it, which shows that it is not easy.</p>
<p>The reason why the Germans have the theory of overthrowing the gold standard is because they are indignant and cynical, and they have also felt something. After the Treaty of Versailles was signed, the victors took away all the gold, silver, and treasures of the defeated countries. Now, Germany has swept through Central Europe, with the land of six countries: Poland, Denmark, Holland, Belgium, Norway, and France, which is not unextensive. But how much gold and silver has been obtained can be seen in the fact that after the outbreak of the European War, European gold has been continuously transported to the United States, and even in mid-July this year, the gold transported to the United States was still worth 300 million yuan. Therefore, although the Germans have won, they have gained nothing. And the gold flowing into the United States, which has been sealed by various governments in mid-June, has already reached 16.86 billion US dollars. The gold belonging to the defeated countries in Europe should be able to be transferred by Germany, but it is prohibited by the US government. Germany wants to make gold no longer become the medium of trade for European countries. Under the current German power, there is a great possibility of becoming a reality. However, the Germans also know that the difficulties of the country are heavy. Not only is it not easy to find another standard, but even time must wait until Germany defeats Britain and the pound collapses before the gold standard in Europe can be clarified. This is still in the indefinite future. Moreover, the barter system of totalitarian countries is indeed a "triumph of poor countries," but it is difficult to predict whether it can be permanently promoted and benefit fully. For example, since the occupied areas of China have been "controlled," they have suffered greatly. Barter is strictly restricted, farmers have no way to sell, and merchants cannot buy. What used to require only one capital is now two or three capitals before one can transport an item. It is impossible to choose a better price. Goods are abandoned on the ground, accumulated in the market, and no one can dredge them. Will it not repeat this mistake in the future when it prevails internationally? Who can foresee it?</p>
<p>However, for Germany, with the excellence of the German nation, perfect organization, and exquisite products, even under the gold standard system, there is no fear of not obtaining gold. It can be concluded that it is definitely not a country that can only obtain gold by hunting and will be poor for a long time. Moreover, the gold possessed by the United States, except for a part of Britain's, is no longer absorbed by the United States from other countries, because the war is over, and what is sought from the United States is less. Therefore, after peace, it will gradually return to its home country. This is one. Furthermore, the United States invests about 1.071 billion US dollars in Germany, Italy, and the countries they occupy, while these countries invest in the United States, which is now blocked, 2.3 billion US dollars, more than double. What's more, in the huge investment of Switzerland in the United States, most of it is the property of the French. Therefore, we know that the gold concentrated in the United States today, worth 20 billion yuan, will inevitably flow back to its own country from the United States in the future. Then, why worry about not having gold? This is two.</p>
<p>As for the selection of gold as a currency material, the predecessors have already discussed it in detail, so there is no need to review it. However, after this war, the United States will inevitably increase a large amount of gold revenue. The more gold flows into the United States, the less that circulates in the countries of the world. What is the future of gold? It is indeed a major problem. Although German Economy Minister Funk still said that "we dare not predict the future of American gold, but we are sure that the future currency of Europe will not be based on gold," what is credible is that the future monetary system will not be the monetary system before today. Whether the monetary policy will still be controlled or restore its freedom, considering the principle that things will inevitably return to their extreme, it is certain that there will be reforms and adjustments. How China should cope with the changes should be prepared in order to adapt to the future environment. If we are concerned about the gains and losses of gold, then the new currency is also a currency, the old currency is also a currency, and they are all the same currency. Gold will still maintain a considerable position in the future monetary system, but it will not be as noble as it is now. This is also a possible phenomenon rather than an accident.</p>

<p>The Course of Recovering Zhenhai</p>
<p>Chongqing – Over the past week, the Japanese launched a fierce attack on Zhenhai. Although it was once captured by the Japanese, the Chinese forces fought fiercely for four days and nights, finally recovering Zhenhai and repelling the Japanese troops harassing various places, creating the most glorious battle result in Zhejiang this year. Regarding the course of recovering Zhenhai and its significance, a certain military spokesperson told the Central News Agency reporter as follows: The Japanese began to invade Zhenhai on the 17th of this month, first capturing Xiaogang Town and Laoshushan. In order to deploy an encirclement line, the Chinese forces made a strategic shift. By the morning of the 19th, the Chinese forces had completed the encirclement. The counterattack began that night. The Chinese soldiers charged in a bloody battle, advancing without retreating. The battle was particularly fierce in Qijiaoyou, with heavy casualties on both sides. The outpost was finally captured by the Chinese forces. Losing this important shield, the Japanese could not maintain their position. After a fierce attack by the Chinese forces for one day and night, Zhenhai was recovered the next morning, annihilating many Japanese soldiers. The Japanese troops collapsed and retreated, and the Chinese forces took advantage of the victory to pursue them, completely eliminating them. Few escaped back to the Japanese warships. At the same time, the Chinese forces on the left bank of the Yangtze River launched a fierce mopping-up operation, completely eliminating the Japanese troops. In summary, the main purpose of the Japanese operation was to impose a blockade on China and further attempt to occupy Ningbo, cutting off the communication between Zhejiang and Jiangxi.

<p>London – Yesterday's air battle became fierce again. Hundreds of British and German planes engaged in a fierce battle over the English Channel, which lasted for a long time. Several times, the warring planes densely covered the sky. Anti-aircraft guns on the southeastern coast of England fired incessantly, and many bombs were dropped. More than fifty German dive bombers, protected by the same number of fighters, attacked a convoy three times. In the afternoon, eighty open-cockpit planes flew low to the coast and attacked ships in the Channel, and began the largest attack on the southeastern coast. Enemy planes even flew inland and dropped several bombs, which landed on cliffs and were repelled by fighters and ground fire. Material damage was minor, and no ships were hit. Subsequently, fifty German dive bombers attacked a convoy consisting of more than twenty small cargo ships, resulting in the most intense air battle of the day. At least two German planes were shot down into the sea by British fighters. When the German bombers approached, anti-aircraft guns roared, giving the first warning, because the enemy bombers were seen flying straight from the French coast to England, tail to tail. The enemy planes flew quite high, with fighters protecting them above. Dozens of British fighters then took to the air, immediately intercepted by German fighters. The enemy bombers flew low and circled to attack the convoy. The first batch of twenty-seven, and the second batch also of twenty-seven, descended vertically and dropped bombs. Anti-aircraft shells exploded around the German planes. The lead plane of the German squadron was especially daring, descending rapidly towards the middle of a ship in the convoy, dropping a bomb when the nose of the plane was about to hit the mast, before flying away horizontally. The remaining planes ascended rapidly and turned back to bomb again, but were forced back by the surrounding shells. They then tried to escape into the clouds, but British fighters followed closely and pursued them. After a burst of machine-gun fire, two German planes were seen catching fire and falling. An hour later, German bombers attacked the convoy for the third time, but were quickly repelled. (Reuter, 26th)</p>
<p>London – According to an official statement, hundreds of British and German planes participated in the fierce battle over the English Channel yesterday.

These ships belonged to a convoy closely protected by naval and air forces, totaling twenty-three ships, it is said. (Haitong, 26th)</p>
<p>British Planes Brave Gale-Force Winds and Rain to Bomb German Naval and Air Bases</p>

The areas attacked included the shipyards of Emden, Wilhelmshaven, and Hamburg, the aircraft factories of Wismar and Wiesensdorf, and the seaplane bases of Borkum and Texel. After the missions were completed, all the planes returned. Yesterday, after a German bomber and a British fighter engaged in combat, the German plane crashed in a field in southwestern England. The crew parachuted to safety and were all captured. According to an official in Oslo, when a German plane flew over the British coast yesterday, a bomber was shot down by a Norwegian torpedo boat. One sailor on the boat was slightly injured. (Reuter, 26th)</p>

<p>London – The Prime Minister of Romania, whose future is uncertain, Gigurtu and Foreign Minister Manoilescu have arrived in Salzburg for a meeting with Hitler.

<h3 id="e21">Germany and Turkey Sign Trade Agreement; Papen Returns Home to Report <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>Istanbul – The German-Turkish trade agreement was signed yesterday, which is quite satisfactory to financial circles here. The trade agreement stipulates that Germany and Turkey will exchange goods worth 11.4 million Turkish pounds each year, enabling Turkey to import high-quality industrial products from Germany, and enabling various orders that could not be fulfilled due to the termination of the German-Turkish clearing agreement to continue to be fulfilled. It is generally believed that the development of German-Turkish trade is due to a shift in Turkish foreign policy. (Haitong, 26th)</p>
<p>London – According to people in London, the trade agreement signed between Germany and Turkey in Istanbul yesterday is fully integrated with the Turkish government's political obligations, as the Turkish government's political obligations do not stipulate that it cannot have trade relations with Germany. (Reuter, 26th)</p>
<p>Ankara – Although the German embassy here has assured inquirers that the German ambassador to Turkey, Papen's trip to Berlin is only to report to Hitler and that he will return here in a few days, political figures here are speculating about what Papen will report to Mr. Bruening today. Despite Germany's various conspiracies and propaganda, its political position in the Balkans seems to be increasingly precarious. The fact that the German-Turkish trade agreement was not signed a few days ago by Ambassador Papen and Turkish Foreign Minister Saracoğlu, as planned by the German side, but was only signed yesterday by minor officials, is another sign of great significance. One of the main factors causing difficulties for Germany is the rivalry between Germany and the Soviet Union in the Balkans. The Soviet Union's interests in military and economic terms conflict with Nazi interests everywhere. According to foreign diplomatic circles, the Soviet Union has greatly expanded its influence in Romania and Yugoslavia in recent months, and is now hoping that Bulgaria will become an effective obstacle to preventing Germany from advancing towards the Black Sea. Currently, the Near East highly praises Turkey's military capabilities and believes that Turkey's firm pro-British stance has spared the Near East from war. If the Soviet Union currently welcomes Turkey to join them and form a group of Britain, Turkey, and the Soviet Union in the Balkans, then the Balkan countries may flock to participate.

<p>London – Authoritative circles announced last night that the British government has notified Bulgaria that it sympathizes with Bulgaria's demand for the return of Dobruja Province from Romania. Britain's move, which coincides with the Salzburg conference, may lead to a rupture in diplomatic relations between Britain and Romania. An official statement last night stated that the Romanian Ambassador to Britain, Tilea, has been recalled to Bucharest. Officials here pointed out that since Britain's guarantee of Romanian independence has taken effect, Britain cannot openly assist Bulgaria's territorial demands. However, Romania abandoned this guarantee this month, so Britain's assistance to Bulgaria is now possible. Neutrals here believe that Britain's move is an attempt to complicate the current turbulent situation in the Balkans, which is hindering Hitler's blitzkrieg against Britain. (United Press, 26th)</p>

<p>Havana – Although the Pan-American Conference has discussed the issue of jointly managing the territories in the Western Hemisphere of European countries that have been invaded for a long time, there is still no sign of compromise. The joint trusteeship plan was proposed by the United States, but Cuba opposes it, believing that if necessary, the colonies of European belligerents in the Western Hemisphere should be temporarily managed by neighboring countries agreed upon by the conference. According to the US plan, colonies would have absolute freedom to decide whether to become republics or merge with another American country. Although the original US proposal has been greatly modified by a sub-committee and suggestions from Brazil and other countries have been incorporated, it is believed that the revised draft still preserves the basic principles of the original plan. The plans proposed by various countries aim to prevent foreign attempts to establish political systems in the Americas that are not suitable for them. They do not contain military measures, but one country has suggested that the privileges enjoyed by diplomats and consuls should be reduced. It is widely believed that a plan to prevent foreign economic influence in the Western Hemisphere will not be formulated until the representatives gather in Washington. The main economic proposal in the conference only requires each republic to issue a general declaration, and the Pan-American Financial and Economic Advisory Council will be given greater freedom of action and become a mechanism to implement general plans to alleviate the current difficulties in surplus exports and develop large-scale American economies.

<p>Secretary of State Hull Suddenly Leaves</p>
<p>Havana – During the Pan-American Conference yesterday, US Secretary of State Hull suddenly left the meeting and returned to his residence to deal with "important matters". The nature of the matter was not announced, and there was much speculation as to whether his departure was related to the conference. Hull's spokesperson said that there were no disagreements at the conference. The Director of the Latin American Department, Duggan, remained at the conference. That morning, Hull presented four plans to isolate foreign political and economic intrusion into the Western Hemisphere. The plans are as follows:</p>
<p>1. Implement the closest economic cooperation between the twenty-one republics of the Americas.</p>
<p>2. Establish a temporary committee to manage the disputed foreign territories in the Western Hemisphere before a permanent agreement is reached.</p>
<p>3. All American countries cooperate to resist disruptive activities in the Western Hemisphere.</p>
<p>4. Foreign diplomats should be strictly limited, and only those who are well-intentioned should be recognized. (International News Service, 26th)</p>
<p>Suggestions from the Argentine Representative</p>
<p>New York – According to a Havana dispatch from the New York Times, the Argentine representative to the Pan-American Conference has stated important reservations regarding the US proposal for joint management of the territories in the Western Hemisphere of European countries. The Argentine representative has put forward his own suggestion, arguing that the twenty-one republics of the Americas should only act on a legal basis, and even then only after consulting with the people of the relevant regions and acting after consultations between the countries. US Secretary of State Hull refused to comment on this suggestion, but what is certain is that the plan will be strongly opposed by the conference, as it would prevent the implementation of management procedures in an emergency, and Hull is deeply concerned that an emergency situation may arise at any time. (Reuter, 26th)</p>
<p>Havana – The Argentine delegate proposed yesterday that the Pan-American Conference should issue a declaration stating that European territories in the Western Hemisphere should be dealt with in accordance with international law and the principle of self-determination, and not by conquest. Argentina's proposal is clearly intended to replace the proposal of US Secretary of State Hull and place the European territories in the West under Pan-American joint management. If it is necessary to take emergency measures and conclude agreements to protect peace and defend the Americas, the declaration proposed by the Argentine representative is a general statement of principle, but its contents include a preamble of nine major points, one of which states that the most suitable solution for democratic political practices and judicial principles should recognize that the development and evolution of the lives of these territories are in accordance with the lives of those who constitute the American republics today. These territories have formed an independent country, so the disposal of these territories should not be carried out by force or conquest, but should allow them to self-determine. Jamaica, one of these territories, has notified the conference that it requests to participate in discussions before any resolution regarding the territory is decided. The Argentine representative presented four proposals to the conference yesterday morning, and the representatives presented thirty or forty proposals yesterday afternoon. According to the rules of the conference, all proposals will not be announced until the last plenary session. The officials of the conference, in answering inquiries about the conference situation, only stated that they were only drafting proposals. A secret plenary session was held yesterday to discuss the location of the second conference. The US representative has submitted four proposals to various committees, the most important of which are proposals on Pan-American economics and European territories. (United Press, 26th)</p>

The petition requests that the US government hold Japan responsible for the safety of American nationals in Japanese-occupied areas of China. As for the proposal to impose an embargo on Japan, President Roosevelt has already issued this embargo order yesterday. The request telegraphed to Washington was sent by six American journalists in Shanghai, those recently listed on the expulsion list of the "Wang Jingwei regime" in Nanjing, and Mr. Aben, the China correspondent of the "New York Times." Aben was insulted and robbed by two armed Japanese men in Shanghai last week.

<p>Washington – Treasury Secretary Morgenthau announced last night that the United States has undertaken to provide Britain with various conveniences, so that in addition to the large number of aircraft it has already ordered, it can purchase 3,000 American aircraft per month. This new method requires the construction of new factories. Britain agrees to pay for the factory construction costs and purchase the products. The US Treasury, Navy, and Army departments have fully agreed to this. The details will be worked out by the Production Committee of the National Defense Commission. After the new factories are built, the United States' ability to manufacture aircraft will far exceed the figure of 50,000 per year mentioned by President Roosevelt in his May 15th defense message. Britain's financial resources seem to be quite abundant. The funds required are very large. The British government has suggested taking immediate action so that it can obtain 3,000 American aircraft per month in the next two years. (Reuter, 26th)</p>

<p>Washington – While Philippine officials have decided to abandon costly defense preparations, the US Army will largely defend the Philippines against foreign aggression. Sources say Philippine President Quezon believes Filipinos cannot resist the invasion of any major land power and therefore does not wish to expand the Philippines' defense. US Army and State Department spokesmen expressed the aforementioned views yesterday. Officials indicated that the Philippines remains a US territory until 1946. North Carolina Democratic Senator Reynolds, while stating that "After 1946, the United States should remove its machine gun grips and gun barrels from the Philippines," also pointed out that before the Filipinos gain independence, the United States has the right to enlist Philippine soldiers into the US garrison. Although opinions differ on possible plans for the Philippines' defense, it is said that General MacArthur has spent considerable time devising a defense strategy for the Filipinos. A senior US official told this newspaper that it is legitimate for the United States to defend the Philippines while the Philippines is still a US territory, but they did not wish to comment on what plan the United States will adopt after 1946. According to the Foreign Policy Association's assessment, if Germany defeats England, the Philippines may be vulnerable to Japanese invasion. According to the association's report, "If Germany wins in Europe, the balance of power in the Far East will change immediately, and Japan may take the opportunity to obtain abundant resources in Southeast Asia. Southeast Asia includes the East Indies, the Malay Peninsula, and Vietnam, and the Philippines may also be among them." The report concludes, "What Japan will do to Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, and the Philippines largely depends on the actions of the US Navy." (26th International Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e31">Brittany Nationalist Independence Movement on the Rise: Independent State to be Established in Five Northwest Coastal Provinces <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>Paris – The Brittany National Committee has decided to organize a Brittany nation-state. German authorities have established a governor-general in the five provinces of Brittany. Breton people believe that German authorities have officially recognized Brittany. (26th Haitong Dispatch)</p>
<p>Paris – The establishment of Brittany as an independent state within France has been decided by the Executive Committee of the Brittany National Committee. The committee appears to be a newly formed central executive committee of various ethnic societies, the most important of which is the Eternal Brittany Society. Since the World War, the society has been actively promoting Brittany's independence movement. The province of Brittany is located in the northwest of France, divided into five districts, projecting into the Atlantic as a peninsula. The inhabitants are Celts, not the Latin people who live in other parts of France. Until 1532, it was an independent duchy. During the French Empire, it enjoyed a large degree of autonomy, which ended only during the French Revolution. The capital of Brittany is Rennes, with a population of 100,000, and is the largest city in the region except for the Brest naval port. Brittany has a population of two million, one million of whom still speak Breton. Those who speak French are mostly in larger cities. Most of the French fishermen and sailors come from this mountainous region. The Breton people are mostly devout Catholics. During the World War, the number of Breton deaths was twice that of other regions of France. These two reasons have promoted the rise of the new autonomous movement. In recent years, Breton leaders have often been accused of participating in conspiracies to bomb French monuments. In this war, several Breton leaders were sentenced to death by military courts, and therefore the independence movement has become more active. The committee's resolution is to establish an agreement with France and Germany to create Brittany's international status, elect a head of state, declare Breton and French as national languages, and build a Celtic university. Regarding this matter, the Breton weekly stated that the resolutions proposed by the National Committee at a mass meeting held in Rohan Castle, Pontivy, have been unanimously accepted. The details are as follows: The Brittany National Committee, in the name of the entire nation, announces that Brittany's political status is no longer like the situation after the World War. The system that suppressed us has collapsed forever. Within a certain period, the Breton nation-state will be established. The Breton constitution will be based on the following principles: Brittany belongs to the Breton people, and the welfare of the people is above all else. The international status of the Breton state and its relations with France and Germany will be determined by agreement. In the current war between England and Germany, the Breton people are determined to confront their old enemies. The outline is divided into eighteen points, and radio and newspapers must support the restoration movement. The land in the country and those that do not support production can only be owned by Breton people. The minerals exploited by France must be returned. In addition, an economic and construction plan is drafted. (26th Haitong Dispatch)</p>

<p>Tokyo – Prime Minister Konoe delivered a radio address to the nation yesterday, criticizing party politics and calling for the prompt reform of national political institutions. His words were very frank. He said that party politics can produce two evils: first, the life of a political party is based on liberalism, and the democracy and socialism it advocates are incompatible with our national policy; second, each political party aims to seize power, which is greatly contrary to our country's system where the parliament should assist the Emperor in handling state affairs. This kind of bad phenomenon must be eliminated, so as to establish a new political situation, so that the people of the whole country can unite and be loyal to the Emperor. At this moment, I have formed a new cabinet and will devote myself to establishing this new political situation. Fortunately, the military authorities and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs have reached a consensus on this matter. Before delivering this radio address, Konoe also met with reporters from various newspapers and made a statement saying that the rumors that the political reform movement is about to be suspended are unfounded. My determination has not changed, and since I have gained the support of the people, I should not fail their expectations. What I should consider for this political reform movement is what kind of method is appropriate. I personally have no specific plan. Regarding this matter, a committee may be organized to study it. In addition, how should the relationship between the government and the parliament be, how should the election law be amended, and how should the various political parties be dealt with? All these questions must be considered. Among them, regarding the political party issue, the government will temporarily adopt a wait-and-see attitude. (25th Havas Dispatch)</p>

<p>Tokyo – The Daily News recently reported that the National Spiritual Mobilization Committee has launched a new movement, advocating a new moral code for the Japanese nation and rejecting all extravagant customs. The Japanese government has decided to ban the production and sale of all luxury goods from October 7 this year. To assist, the committee has decided to start with education and propaganda, so as to promote the atmosphere. The specific method is to first persuade students across the country to reject all luxury clothing and supplies, and to erect slogans in hotels, cafes, beauty salons, and department stores, advocating frugality. Anyone who purchases luxury goods will be warned once discovered. (25th Havas Dispatch)</p>

He is currently the chairman of the "Constitutional Research Association." His usual political stance is to "create a new Japan by the hands of Japanese youth." During the "February 26 Incident" in 1936, Goto first emerged and was also "one of the behind-the-scenes figures." Later, when Konoe organized his first cabinet, his chief secretary, Kazami Akira, was recommended by Goto. Any of Konoe's political activities are related to Goto, so the general public regards Goto as Prime Minister Konoe's "one-man think tank." (25th Havas Dispatch)</p>

<p>Germany Claims England Should Be Responsible</p>
<p>London – Among the ships used to repatriate French naval officers and soldiers, the French ship "Meknes" (6,127 tons) was sunk without warning. According to an announcement by the British Navy, the ship had French flags painted on both sides, was brightly lit, and had a spotlight shining on the French flag. At 10:30 pm, French sailors on the bridge of the "Meknes" heard the sound of a motor engine and saw the trace of an approaching ship, and were immediately fired upon by machine guns. The "Meknes" immediately stopped and sounded its whistle to indicate that it had stopped, and sent a signal asking the other ship what it was. It received no response, so it flashed its lights and explained its ship name and nationality several times, but the other party continued to strafe and fire small cannons. The lifeboats on the port side of the "Meknes" were shot through and could not be used. At 10:55 pm, the hull was hit by a torpedo and exploded, killing several people. The ship sank in less than ten minutes. Hundreds of people jumped into the water because they could not lower the lifeboats. According to survivors, they were rescued by British ships. About 1,000 people, including 120 officers and 41 soldiers, have been rescued by the British Navy and landed in England. They are now being treated in hospitals, and the rest are temporarily residing in naval facilities. It is believed that there are still survivors who may have gone to the French coast. Naval Minister Alexander said in the Lower House yesterday that there were about 1,300 officers and soldiers on the "Meknes." Before the ship set sail for Marseille, the British had informed the French government representative of their intention to repatriate them. According to the information received so far, the ship was intercepted by a line of motor torpedo boats and fired upon without warning. Alexander also said that he heard that the German command had admitted responsibility for sinking the ship. It is very obvious that the ship was non-combatant and was intentionally attacked. It is not yet possible to confirm how many French people died, but it is feared that about 300 people were killed. It is reported that the "Meknes" had safe navigation insurance. (26th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Berlin – After the French ship "Meknes" (6,217 tons displacement) carrying 1,300 French soldiers was sunk by a torpedo while sailing from England back to France, the German authorities issued a statement last night, stating that the British Admiralty released a battle report yesterday, mentioning that the 18,000-ton "Meknes" was sunk in the English Channel and that the German government should be responsible. The difference in tonnage is enough to prove the inaccuracy of the British news. The British Admiralty announced that the French ships detained by the British still fly the French flag, and the German government notified the French government that ships flying the French flag after the 13th would also be regarded as enemy ships. The British government had the responsibility to notify the French government when it sent the "Meknes" to transport French soldiers back to the country. The German government never received news about the British notification, and the British government should be responsible for the sinking of the "Meknes." (26th Haitong Dispatch)</p>

<p>London – London revealed today that on June 17, when the evacuation of British people from France was nearing completion, the British mail ship "Lancastria" (16,243 tons) was bombed and sunk by Germany in the French port of Saint-Nazaire. About 1,813 people are still missing. It is estimated that the ship carried about 5,300 people, including some women and children seeking refuge. Only 2,477 people were rescued. However, the actual number of people rescued may be more than the above number, and some people may have managed to land and fall into enemy hands. The situation during the evacuation was quite difficult, so it is not easy to estimate the exact number. The "Lancastria" was bombed by German aircraft for half an hour after loading the evacuating British and still moored, before being hit by multiple bombs, causing many casualties. The ship leaned over, making it difficult to lower the lifeboats. The ship sank within half an hour after being bombed. Most of the survivors were rescued by small boats, and some swam to shallow water. The courage shown by the crew and sailors when the ship was hit is highly praised. (26th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<p>London – According to a Reuters parliamentary lobby correspondent, Minister of Economic Warfare Dalton will announce a broader plan in the Lower House next Tuesday to prevent goods from falling into enemy hands and to curb enemy exports. It is now believed that the military certification system will be implemented in a wider area than at present, simplifying the blockade. This will free up the navy for other tasks and make it easier for neutral countries to trade.

<h3 id="e39">Germany Develops Plan to Transform European Economy: Will Develop Trade with China After the War: Finke's Remarks Worth Noting <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>Berlin – German Economics Minister Finke met with Fischer, the editor of the Vienna-based "Southeast Magazine," yesterday and answered six questions raised by Fischer, elaborating on Germany's economic plan for the New Europe. In addition to serving as Minister of Economics, Finke also serves as the President of the National Bank. Recently, he was ordered by General Goering to draft a broad plan for the post-war German and European economic structure, so his remarks are of great importance. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>(1) "What will be the general economic structure of the New Europe?" Finke replied, "This war will have a significant impact on the European and international economic structure. In the future, we will cooperate closely with Italy in all aspects, and we will transform the European economic structure with the economic structures of Germany and Italy, and promote the methods we have gained in economic victory before and during the war, and concentrate on making it universal."</p>
<p>(2) "What will be the basis of the European currency after the war?" Finke replied that this is a secondary issue, and the most important thing is still the economic structure issue. If the structure is determined, the currency basis will be easily solved. Of course, the German Mark will occupy a superior position. The increase in Germany's power will inevitably make the Mark's position more consolidated. The area where the Mark is used will be greatly expanded, and Germany's current bilateral trade agreements and clearing agreements with various countries will become multilateral trade agreements and multi-faceted clearing agreements.</p>
<p>(3) "Under the new European economic system, what goods will be lacking and what goods will be in surplus?" Finke replied, "It is undeniable that Europe lacks certain products. We will definitely not be completely self-sufficient, but we must intertwine the European economic structure with the world economic structure, and exchange raw materials from the world market with Europe's high-quality industrial products. But there is one limitation, that is, in the area we control, this kind of product must be as abundant as possible, so that it does not have to rely on foreign goods." Regarding this point, Finke mentioned oil, coffee, tea, and cocoa. Finke emphasized that during this war, Germany's raw material situation has greatly improved. In the future, after the war ends, the resources it controls will be unprecedented, especially coal, iron, and wood.</p>
<p>(4) "What goods will the New Europe export to Russia, North and South America, and East Asia, and what goods will it exchange for from these places?" Finke replied, "We have a broad trade agreement with Soviet Russia, and Germany exchanges industrial products for Soviet Russia's raw materials, which will have substantial progress in the future. As for the United States, it depends on the attitude of the United States towards international trade. So far, the United States has been unusually discriminatory towards German goods, and its trade policy hopes to be the world's parasitic country and exporting country, so the future of German-US trade is highly doubtful. We dare not predict the future of American gold, but we are sure that Europe's future currency can no longer be based on gold, because the value of currency should be regulated by the country's economic laws, and it cannot be based on gold whose own value changes from day to day. For example, if the United States now wants to export gold and import goods, then the value of its US dollar will also be affected. In terms of South America and East Asia, we have always maintained excellent trade relations. We believe that once the British pirate behavior is stopped, this trade will have smooth development. It must be known that the East Asian market has been greatly affected by the Sino-Japanese War. If the political situation is clarified, then the economic relations between Germany and China will immediately have good progress. This progress should also be desired by Japan."</p>
<p>(5) "How is Germany's wartime finance?" Finke replied, "Our wartime finance can be summed up in one word: 'work'. We will never waste money except for what we earn from work. Germany issues exchange coupons, which are the basis of German currency. Because of the stability of prices and wages, Germany's public debt is not a concern."</p>
<p>(6) "How will the wartime economy change to a peacetime economy, and will it cause an economic panic?" Finke's reply was extremely optimistic, stating that this change will be gradual and will not cause any difficulties. Finke then listed the development of the future European economic structure as follows: (1) Conclude long-term trade agreements with European countries to make Germany a safe market for European countries, and at the same time give German goods a better opportunity to sell in Europe. (2) Expand and enrich existing clearing agreements to establish a stable exchange and clearing system between countries. (3) Exchange experience in agriculture and industry to maximize the production of European raw materials, and at the same time use Europe's economic resources to improve the living standards of the European people, so that they are not afraid of any external blockade. (4) Seek close cooperation in economic policy, currency, loans, production, and trade, so that European countries are economically united. This integrated European economic group will trade with other countries based on the principle of equality.</p>
<p>Finke finally concluded that the peacetime economic plan he drafted will ensure that the German economy achieves the highest level of security, the German people achieve the highest level of consumption, and improve their living standards. The European economy will be reorganized with this goal. (26th Haitong Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e41">French Official Claims Interests in China Have Been Preserved <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>Vichy – It was officially announced today that, as a result of negotiations between the French government and the Japanese government and the local "Chinese authorities" in Tianjin and Shanghai, France's interests in China, especially the concessions in Shanghai and Tianjin, have been preserved. In the Shanghai agreement, France has handed over the Xujiahui area adjacent to the French Concession to the local "Chinese authorities" and allowed the Japanese army to govern the area. The Xujiahui area was under French administration when the Sino-Japanese War broke out, and the French army occupied the area to make it a buffer zone between China and France. The negotiations between France and Japan ended with an increase in economic exchanges between Japan and Indochina. One of the provisions allows Japanese commercial aircraft to fly over Vietnam to Bangkok. France is preparing to hold negotiations in Bangkok to resolve the border disputes between Vietnam and Siam.

<h3 id="e42">General Chen Anbao's Biography: National Government Praises Him <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>Somewhere in Eastern Jiangxi – General Chen Anbao, the former commander of a certain army, died in battle in the Lian Tang position during the counterattack against Nanchang last May. The National Government has issued a clear order to commend him. Here is the general's biography: The general was from Huangyan, Zhejiang. In the Xinhai year, he went from an enlisted soldier to the third class of the infantry department of the Baoding Military Academy. He graduated in the fifth year of the Republic. In the winter of the 24th year, he was promoted to the commander of the 79th Division due to his merits. When the "July 7" War of Resistance broke out, he was ordered to garrison Lugouqiao. At the end of October, he was transferred to Zhejiang and Shanghai. At the beginning of November, the Japanese landed at Jinshan and planned to occupy Pinghu with a part of the force to cut off the Shanghai-Hangzhou Road to the west. At that time, the general was leading his troops to Jiaxing. Upon hearing the alarm, he rushed to Pinghu overnight to deploy defenses, supervise the troops in combat, and launch surprise attacks from time to time, repeatedly frustrating the fierce attack and eventually thwarting the Japanese plan. In February of the 27th year, the general crossed the Fuchun River in Zhuji and attacked Yuhang. He then went deep into the occupied areas of Jiahu to carry out guerrilla warfare. Then, in early March, he led his troops eastward, crossed the Beijing-Hangzhou National Road, and broke into the rear of the Japanese army. The merit of the guerrilla warfare in Western Zhejiang was laid by the general. In August, he was ordered to transfer westward to Eastern Jiangxi, arriving in Dongxiang in mid-July. Subsequently, he was appointed as the commander of the 29th Army and stationed in Yongxiu. At the end of August, the situation on the front of Nanxun was tense. The general led his troops to occupy the area of Wushimen north of Dean overnight. In early September, the Dexu Highway was in frequent danger. The general led his troops to the rescue, and the siege was relieved. In March of the 28th year, the Japanese crossed the river to attack Nanchang. On May 3, the general was ordered to attack Nanchang, with a deadline of five days. The general, considering the urgent deadline, rushed to Ren Gang to command without waiting for the completion of the assembly. On the night of the 5th, his troops completed the stealthy crossing of the Fu River. He then led his troops forward, planning to advance towards Nanchang from the area west of the railway. At two o'clock the next morning, after passing through the railway, they were suddenly attacked by the Japanese. They engaged in repeated hand-to-hand combat. At the highlands north of Tongshu Temple, after dawn, the Japanese artillery bombardment became even more fierce, the infantry also gradually increased, and the Japanese aircraft also bombed continuously. The general, considering the small area and numerous casualties, calmly directed the soldiers to fight back. At 4 pm, the battle became more intense. A part of the Japanese had invaded the northwestern highlands of Tongshu Temple. The general urgently led Division Commander Liu Yuqing and the remaining special service platoon to counterattack the Japanese and recovered the highlands. At that time, Division Commander Liu had been injured, but the general was still unharmed. At 5:10 pm, the left wing fell into chaos. The general knew that the situation was critical, so he led his entourage to charge, shouting to kill the Japanese, and said, "Die, die in the front." He was immediately hit by a bullet and injured his heart. He died for his country, at 5:15 pm on June 5th of the 28th year. (24th Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e54">Automatically Reduce Conversion Rate <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>(Hong Kong Correspondence) Commercial Press, China Book Company, and other major publishing houses are giants in our publishing industry. Their published books are originally priced in national currency, but when sold in Hong Kong and Macau, they are converted into the local currency. However, the discounts range from 20% to 50%, causing inconvenience to buyers. With the start of the semester approaching, the Commercial Press, China Book Company, World Book Company, and Chung Cheng Book Company, in order to alleviate the burden on students, have agreed on a uniform method, which will be implemented from the first of next month: (1) The selling price in Hong Kong, Macau, and Guangzhouwan will be calculated using the general surcharge method. Elementary school textbooks will be surcharged by 8%, and middle school textbooks will be surcharged by 5%. However, new books that have already been surcharged will not be surcharged again. (2) The selling price in Hong Kong, Macau, and Guangzhouwan will be based on Hong Kong dollars, Western currency, or silver. Shipping costs and exchange fees will be temporarily waived. (3) The selling price in Hong Kong and Macau will be based on Hong Kong dollars and Western currency. The conversion rate will be 40 cents in Hong Kong dollars or Western currency for every one yuan of national currency. (4) The selling price of textbooks in Guangzhouwan will be based on silver. The conversion rate will be 50 cents in silver for every one yuan of national currency. (5) For wholesalers in Guangdong who purchase in national currency, in addition to the surcharge mentioned in the first item, an additional 30% will be added for shipping and exchange fees. It is noted that before February, the Hong Kong Booksellers Association had issued an opinion on reducing the selling price of textbooks, which attracted attention from all sectors at the time. This time, the bookstores themselves are reducing the conversion rate, which is equivalent to cutting prices and is good news for the cultural sector.</p>

When the Third Five-Year Plan is completed (i.e., at the end of 1942), the number of primary and secondary school students will reach 40 million. In 1913, the government spent 80 "kopecks" on education for each citizen, but currently, the Soviet government spends 124 rubles on education for each citizen. The education industry in the central Asian Republics has a special development. In the past ten years, the total number of schools has increased from 381 to 4,200. In 1929, the number of students was 26,700. From 1939 to 1940, the number has increased to 265,000. This figure only refers to Tajikistan.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the spot gold market was dismal, but the air of stagnation was slightly swept away, and the market showed a bit of vitality. It was rumored that someone was going to seize the city court, so operators tended to buy, and the price crept outside the 5,300 yuan mark. It opened in the morning at 5,300 yuan. It was heard that the gold shop took the lead in raising the price. Although a money exchange house intervened to sell, the bank help and another money exchange house were quite active in searching for and buying. The highest price once reached 5,350 yuan. Later, the momentum of the rise was hindered by the continuous selling of the money exchange house, and many scattered orders were sold at limited prices. The midday closing price fell back to 5,310 yuan. The after-market was quieter, but the underlying trend was still firm. After opening, due to the strong demand from retail investors and banks, it rose from 5,315 yuan to 35 yuan. As a result, another bank turned out, and it closed a few yuan lower, and the closing price was 5,328 yuan, an increase of 53 yuan compared with the previous day. The trading volume was relatively strong in the morning, totaling about 2,000 taels. The price of gold jewelry in silver shops followed up by 10 yuan.

The bank did 50 taels of mutual transactions, rising to 5,350 yuan. However, after that, there were fewer buyers, and more people were selling at high prices, and a certain money exchange house continued to sell, so it fell back by 30 yuan. The gold shop sold 40 taels to the bank, at 5,320 yuan. Later, because the foreign exchange rate of 6.125 yuan for U.S. dollars suddenly became difficult to settle, the buying trend revived. Many retail investors absorbed it, and it rose again by 20 yuan. The money exchange house advanced 20 taels to the gold shop, at 5,340 yuan. Because the U.S. exchange rate returned to flat, and the money exchange house returned to being bullish, and scattered buyers followed suit to close out, the midday closing price had fallen back to 5,310 yuan. The market opened 5 yuan higher in the afternoon. The gold shop advanced 20 taels to the money exchange house, at 5,315 yuan. Later, the bank help and a certain silver shop made small advances, and it was pulled up again by 20 yuan. The bank advanced 20 taels to the gold shop, at 5,335 yuan. Afterwards, another bank and a money exchange house sold, falling back by a few yuan. The silver shop advanced 30 taels to the bank, at 5,328 yuan, which was the closing price for the evening.

<p>Yesterday, securities in the unofficial market suddenly weakened due to rumors of court receivership. All bonds were in a state of decline. While some bulls were selling off, bears were also covering their positions, causing uncertainty and wavering confidence.

<p>The yarn market remains in a state of fluctuation, with relatively little actual trading among traders. Hong Kong-based firms show a stronger appetite for single-ply yarn. Other firms have limited capacity for development due to transportation difficulties. In the market, major players are consistently taking long positions, unwilling to relinquish their holdings, resulting in strong support. Significant fluctuations are expected only when conditions change.</p>
<p>The yarn market opened this morning with weak sentiment. The opening price was 928 yuan. Upon this price being announced, speculators mostly took a wait-and-see approach, as they had suffered small losses by buying in at the opening price the previous day and subsequently seeing the price fall. As a result, they were more cautious. However, as the market price weakened slightly, a major firm stepped in and bought several bales, restoring confidence. At the same time, gold prices recovered, and the market gradually rose to 937 yuan, closing steadily. Statistics show that 1,360 bales were traded during the half-day session. The price of 20-count Double Horse yarn rose by 4 yuan.</p>

<p>The spot cotton market is showing some development. Shenxin Mill is relatively active in its demand. Some smaller mills, having ordered too much foreign cotton, have a surplus and are selling it off, leading to mixed sentiments. British mills have shown some interest, but the volume is not significant. The details of spot cotton transactions are listed on the left. Pengjiapu: 235, 00 Unified Mill bought 500 bales of Middling at 232.00, No. 2 Mill bought 500 bales of Dumila at 180.00, No. 31 Mill bought 200 bales of Tongzhou cotton at 169.00, and another 200 bales.</p>

Yesterday's conditions, including forecasts, showed no significant changes.</p>
<p>The trading of foreign cotton in Shanghai is quite sluggish. All parties are maintaining a silent attitude. Only one British mill has engaged in small-volume transactions, but only in long-staple Indian-American cotton. Other mills are relatively quiet.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the sugar market saw Tai Gu Che Bai B mark quoted at HK$13.25. The trading house telegraphed to place an order, but has not yet received a reply.

Re-exported goods were quoted at 50.5 to 50.8 yuan, and remained at 50.5 yuan in the afternoon, up 0.5 yuan. Tai Gu Che Bai B mark initially rose 0.5 yuan to 73 yuan, then fell to 72.7 yuan, up only 0.2 yuan. DV mark remained at 70 yuan. H mark Che Chi was relatively flat at 55.2 yuan.

<h3 id="e86">Grains: Over 60,000 More Bags of Foreign Rice Arrive; Road Freight Has Already Fallen by Approximately 2 Yuan <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>The downward trend in the foreign rice market intensified yesterday, mainly due to the congestion of arrivals, leading to unstable sentiment. Sellers have given up on holding up prices and are trying to sell quickly, offering discounts to speculators eager to open trading. However, due to the suspension of purchases from inland customers and the weakening appetite of local stores, a "small but unwilling to buy" trend has formed, resulting in continued price declines of 1 to 2 yuan, while trading remains sparse. The closing price for No. 1 old Saigon rice was only 54.5 yuan, new pointed rice was 53.5 yuan and 53 yuan, and old No. 2 rice was 51 yuan.</p>
<p>While the spot price of foreign rice continues to fall, the price of cargo returning in its original packaging has plummeted by 2 yuan. Besides one ship loaded on June 26, two ships carrying 85,000 bags of No. 2 Siamese rice handled by Jianyuan Shenji and Saigon rice jointly ordered by rice merchants have arrived or will arrive yesterday and today. Speculators and hoarders are competing to sell, and trading firms and customers are also trying to unload. Although major players are trying to maintain prices, it is difficult for the market price to stabilize. Siamese rice loaded on June 26 was initially offered at 60.02 yuan, dropping to 59 yuan, with spot delivery at 59.2 yuan and 59 yuan. Saigon for spot delivery was initially offered only at 57.5 yuan. Shipments loaded in late June and early July were also offered at 59.05 yuan. Although the market price has been declining, sentiment has not yet stabilized, as the arrival of large quantities of rice coincides with sluggish sales. The market appears to have a continuing downward trend. Yesterday's transaction volume was 400 to 500 tons, and the volume of spot rice was about 4,000 bags.</p>
<p>Another shipment of foreign rice has arrived in Shanghai. The ship St. Quentin, owned by Huide Company, arrived directly from Saigon with 6,000 tons, totaling approximately 62,000 bags. The ship arrived in Shanghai at approximately 2 PM yesterday and berthed at buoys 25 and 26 for unloading.</p>
<p>There were no arrivals of japonica glutinous rice yesterday. Rumors suggest that unofficial trading is also in a depressed state, making it difficult to maintain prices. The price of japonica rice has fallen by approximately 1 yuan. Changbang fresh clear special japonica is only 67.2 yuan and 67 yuan, special clear japonica is 66 yuan, Wuxi clear japonica is 65 yuan and 66 yuan, Changzhou Sukun japonica is from 64 to 65 yuan, second-grade from Suqian is 60 yuan, Qingsi thin rice fresh is 65 yuan and 66 yuan, Suqian is 62 yuan and 63 yuan, and Nangang husk early rice is 58.5 yuan and 58 yuan. The price of glutinous rice has fallen by 0.5 to 0.6 yuan. Liyang special yuan is 62.6 yuan, Jintan special yuan is 62 yuan, Changzhou white yuan is 61.5 yuan and 61 yuan, Danyang white yuan is 60.05 yuan, second-grade from Suqian is 58.5 yuan, Hong Kong white yuan is 58 yuan, second-grade is 55 yuan and 56 yuan, etc.</p>

<p>Flour: Yesterday's market trend remained weak. Since the factory price was reduced by 0.5 yuan, spot sales in this area have received some attention. However, prices are still considered high, as Japanese factory flour and domestic miscellaneous brands are also being sold at discounted prices. It is reported that 500 bags of Green Phoenix brand current flour were traded at a price as low as 14.1 yuan to 14 yuan, which is 0.1 to 0.2 yuan lower than before. Other miscellaneous brands only saw small transactions of tens to hundreds of bags, so prices were slightly uneven. As for the No. 2 flour of genuine brands, the factory price continued to open at 15.5 yuan, and factories released approximately 5,000 bags.</p>
<p>Wheat: Trading was still slow yesterday. It is estimated that several thousand to nearly ten thousand bags from Hongkou arrived at the port. Besides the majority being stored in warehouses awaiting sale, some cargo owners plan to sell off their stocks depending on market conditions. Therefore, prices have fallen to 19 yuan and 18.5 yuan. It is reported that Japanese factories purchased over 2,000 bags, and Chinese factories also purchased over 1,000 bags, setting the price at 21.5 yuan.</p>

<p>The soybean cake market has been severely affected since the loss of transportation rights. Access to the Hua Nan region has been greatly impacted. Control over inland sales locations has also tightened. Therefore, after briefly performing well in late June and early July, the soybean cake market has been declining daily. Recently, many goods from Guangdong and Shantou syndicates have not been cleared, leading to fierce competition. The overall situation is deteriorating and difficult to reverse. Selling prices have fallen by more than 3 yuan from their peak. Yesterday, one cartload of fertilizer-grade Zizi brand cake was sold for 10.01 yuan, three cartloads of Yuanlong cake were sold for 10 yuan, and 2,500 pieces of Qingzhong cake were sold for 9.2 yuan to 9 yuan.</p>

<p>Hongji white coal from French Annam, originally used as raw material for manufacturing coal balls, was previously thought to be at risk of supply disruptions due to the blockade of Haiphong. However, the opposite has happened. The supply is constant and abundant. Recently, the ship Maller arrived with over 2,400 tons of No. 2 coal dust, which is being unloaded at the dock.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the international silk market remained stable with almost no fluctuations. Foreign firms in this port completed 20 dan of white silk at prices the same as the previous market day. Japanese trading firms, benefiting from a monopoly on silk exports, found it easier to obtain raw silk, and at lower prices. This is because they are responsible for transporting it to Shanghai. As a result, some silk merchants, known for their integrity over the past three years, have been frequenting the offices of Japanese trading firms. Yesterday, Mitsui completed 90 dan of Zheli silk, with a price of 2,200 yuan per dan, which is 300 yuan lower than prices offered by British and French firms.</p>

The selling price of black tea ranged from 290 yuan to 310 yuan, while the selling price of pearl tea ranged from 250 yuan to 300 yuan. Based on quality comparisons, prices were 5 to 10 yuan lower than before. The current international price is gradually tightening, and sentiment is weakening daily. The market may have difficulty stabilizing.</p>

<h3 id="e93">Eradicating Crime in the Concessions: Earnest Expectations from Citizens, Decisive Resolution Expected at Next Week's Meeting, Director-General's Procedures Beyond Reproach <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>Armed crime in the concessions is frequently observed and has become increasingly rampant recently. Assassinations, kidnappings, and robberies occur almost daily, disrupting public peace and order. Director-General Ke Chihsien of the Shanghai Municipal Council earnestly appealed to the Consular Body to jointly find a solution. The Consular Body held a special meeting the day before yesterday to discuss the matter. Although the content of the discussion was not made public, the large number of participating consular countries and the length of the discussion indicate the importance the Consular Body attaches to this issue. The Consular Body has scheduled a second meeting next Friday to reach a practical resolution for implementation. Residents within the concessions, both Chinese and foreign, are eagerly hoping that the Consular Body will reach an effective and concrete decision this time, severely curbing the political assassinations and armed crimes such as kidnappings and robberies that are prevalent within the concessions, and striving to restore good order and ensure the protection of every law-abiding citizen.</p>
<p>Next Meeting to Decide on Measures</p>
<p>The English-language newspaper North China Daily News reports that the Danish Consul-General in Shanghai, also acting as leader of the Consular Body, Mr. Hill, stated to reporters this morning (the 26th) that the Consular Body responded to the appeal issued by the Director-General of the Shanghai Municipal Council and will discuss and decide on specific measures at the next meeting. According to him, the consuls of various countries with consular jurisdiction reached a resolution yesterday (the 25th) on the Shanghai Municipal Council's request for assistance in dealing with the current political illegal activities in Shanghai. However, the meeting had to be postponed until next week, which is regrettable, as this issue should have been resolved at yesterday's meeting. However, it is expected that the Consular Body will reach a definitive outcome at the next meeting next Friday. Mr. Hill declined to make any further comments.</p>
<p>Director-General's Procedures Beyond Reproach</p>
<p>According to another consul this morning, the Director-General of the Shanghai Municipal Council was criticized by Japanese Consul-General Miura Yoshiaki for making his appeal to the leader of the Consular Body public in the city's newspapers. It should be known that the Director-General of the Shanghai Municipal Council's actions are not to be blamed. Although the Japanese consul's comment that the Director-General of the Shanghai Municipal Council's procedures were improper may not be entirely inaccurate, the improper steps taken were all due to the Consular Body's failure to provide assistance to the Shanghai Municipal Council in recent days.</p>
<p>Unanimous Agreement to Curb Terror</p>
<p>The special meeting of the Consular Body the day before yesterday began at 3:30 PM. A total of fourteen consuls attended, including British Consul-General George Moss, Acting Consul Patrick, Japanese Consul-General Miura, Danish Consul-General Hill, etc., chaired by Mr. Hill. Mr. Miura arrived latest and spoke most frequently. Initially, he strongly criticized Director-General Ke Chihsien, stating that his request to convene the meeting was an "abnormal" move. He said, "Mr. Ke Chihsien's letter was published before the consuls of various countries had received it and without consulting other directors of the Shanghai Municipal Council, which is inappropriate. This approach has the implication of coercing the Consular Body, intending to order them on how to curb terrorists. However, the Consular Body has its own freedom of opinion and action, collaborating with the Shanghai Municipal Council, not being in a position to be led." He also said he would issue a statement expressing his disagreement. However, Japan's opposition to this special meeting of the Consular Body is of course. Importantly, all consuls present did not object to Mr. Ke Chihsien's proposal. It is reported that Mr. Ke Chihsien has written to Mr. Okamoto, the Japanese director of the Shanghai Municipal Council, expressing his apologies for publishing his letter to the Danish Consul-General on the 20th without prior notice. Therefore, Mr. Miura's criticism has lost its basis.</p>
<h3 id="e94">New Fourth Army Approaching Suzhou, Japanese Army on High Alert, Strengthening Defense Works <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>According to sources from Suzhou, the situation there has become very tense recently. The stationed Japanese army is extremely anxious, staying inside the city and refraining from going out. This is because the forces of the New Fourth Army have extended from Yixing to the vicinity of Suzhou and the Suyu-Jiading Road. A portion of the Chinese army once stormed into Huzhou a week ago, and the main force of the puppet "Pacification Army," Cheng Wan's army, has defected in the Suyu-Jiading Road area, resulting in fierce fighting. As a result, mail to and from Suyu-Jiading has been suspended for several days. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Puppet Army Defection</p>
<p>A week ago, the Japanese army in Huzhou mobilized various mixed puppet troops to attack the guerrillas near Huzhou. The Chinese army calmly responded, repelling the Japanese army back into the city. At that time, they seized one machine gun and more than ten rifles, and killed dozens of Japanese and puppet troops. The Japanese army, still unwilling to accept this defeat, recently tried to invade again, using the puppet troops as shields. However, some of the puppet troops refused to die for them and defected midway. The guerrillas ambushing in the surrounding areas responded in succession, attacking from both sides and surrounding the Japanese army, annihilating them separately. Only a few broke through and fled in the direction of Shanghai-Hangzhou and Suyu, Jiading.</p>
<p>Intense Warfare</p>
<p>From the 21st to yesterday, residents near Fengmen (leading to the Suyu-Jiading Road) in Suzhou heard intense gunfire and artillery fire in the early morning and late at night, coming from the direction of the Suyu-Jiading Road. This was due to the fact that the puppet Pacification Army, Cheng Wan's army, stationed along the Suyu-Jiading Road, had also responded after hearing of the defection of the puppet troops in Huzhou. They contacted the local New Fourth Army and fought alongside them, attacking the Japanese army, resulting in fierce guerrilla warfare. The fighting was still ongoing as of yesterday. It is reported that the Japanese army suffered heavy casualties. The main force of the New Fourth Army is now advancing towards the suburbs of Suzhou. Therefore, mail to and from Suzhou and Jiaxing has not been restored by the post office from the 20th to yesterday.</p>
<p>Tight Security</p>
<p>Due to the intense fighting on the Suyu-Jiading Road and the approaching of New Fourth Army forces near the suburbs of Suzhou, the Japanese puppet forces in Suzhou have tightly closed Fengmen, Xiangmen, which lead to the Suyu-Jiading Road, and Xinbanmen, Xumen, and Panmen, which lead to the four rural areas, prohibiting entry and exit. The other gates, Loumen, Qimen, Pingmen, and Laomen, are still passable, but security checks are extremely strict, especially regarding "passes" and "epidemic prevention certificates." In addition to the defensive works already built, sandbags are piled up and barbed wire is added around the city and outside the city. Japanese military police patrol day and night (in greater numbers than usual), searching residents' homes, ostensibly for "epidemic prevention," but in reality fearing that the New Fourth Army will infiltrate the city. Disguised Chinese members of the Japanese secret police are secretly gathering information and checking suspicious individuals in teahouses and other noisy places. A portion of Cheng Wan's troops of the puppet Pacification Army remaining in the city has been secretly monitored by the Japanese army. Cheng Wan himself is not in Suzhou.</p>

<p>The German Embassy in China recently shipped a large number of films from Berlin to Shanghai for screening. Among them, films about the Norwegian war, etc., were screened the day before yesterday, inviting the local press. In addition, there is a film called "Baptism of Fire," which describes the activities of the air force during the Polish war and is more exciting. It will be screened at the German school on the 29th of this month to promote propaganda.</p>
<h3 id="e96">Medicines Shipped from the United States to China are Blocked in Vietnam, Malaria is Rampant in the Southwest, Chinese Side is Negotiating for Release <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>According to informed sources yesterday, a large quantity of medicines shipped from the United States to China by the American Red Cross for the purpose of providing relief to Chinese civilians have been blocked in Hanoi and Haiphong due to the closure of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway. As a result, diseases in the southern provinces of China are rampant. It is said that the anti-malaria campaign being carried out in Yunnan Province has been most affected, as quinine accounts for nearly one-third of the medicines blocked from entering China. Currently, malaria is prevalent in Yunnan and neighboring provinces, affecting schoolchildren, and most schools have been forced to close. The diplomatic community, recognizing the severity of the situation, is taking steps to have these medical supplies released. It is understood that the US Consul-General in Shanghai received a strongly worded telegram from the Chinese authorities in Chongqing yesterday. It has also been learned that there are a total of two hundred and five tons of medicines blocked in Hanoi. It is also said that most of the goods received by the US Embassy and the US Naval Detachment in Hanoi are food, and the medicines have not yet been released. It is reported that the Chinese side is also taking steps to release the large quantity of medicines blocked in Yangon due to the closure of the Yunnan-Burma Road.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Finance has stipulated several methods to encourage the raising of loans and solicitation of donations. In order to encourage the raising of loans and solicitation of donations, the government will specially issue patriotic commemorative badges. The patriotic commemorative badges will be awarded to the following personnel: A. Members and staff of fundraising associations who have successfully solicited donations in various regions. B. Members and staff of fundraising branches who have successfully solicited donations in various regions. For those in fundraising associations and fundraising branches whose personnel have not been re-elected, their predecessors may also be presented by their respective associations for award. All donors who request commemorative items may be awarded by the Ministry of Finance after verification. Patriotic commemorative badges do not have different levels.</p>
<h3 id="e98">Donation to Aid Belgium Has Ended Completely <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>After the renowned sculptor Zhang Chongren and others responded to the declaration made by Ambassador Gihmus, a donation method was established and implemented with the approval of the ambassador. Various sectors in Shanghai, both Chinese and foreign, sympathizing with the plight of the Belgian people and the intensity of the resistance of the soldiers on the front lines, were exceptionally enthusiastic about donating. In addition to continually shipping the collected funds and purchased medical supplies to the Belgian government for distribution to wounded soldiers and displaced people, efforts continued to solicit donations to complete the task. It is reported that the fundraising campaign has now ended completely because the military operations in that country have come to an end and the government has been able to care for displaced and wandering civilians. Therefore, overseas fundraising has ceased.</p>
<h3 id="e99">Decline in the Yarn Industry, Factories Reduce Working Hours <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>Since traffic to the coast is disrupted and yarn prices have plunged, yarn mills in this port are reducing working hours one after another to maintain operations. The factories affiliated with the Japan Yarn Industry Association have reduced production by 10%. Ewo Yarns, which previously worked thirteen shifts a week, reduced by 20%, then reduced by 25%. From next month, it is reported that it will work six shifts per week, reducing by half. Ewo's products were previously shipped to the interior via Ningbo. However, sales have been cut off since the Zhejiang coast was blockaded by the Japanese army. The production of Dragon Bell brand cotton cloth has now been reduced by 20%.</p>
<h3 id="e100">Unwithdrawn Japanese Warships in Hangzhou Bay: Situation Remains Tense in Zhenhai; Japanese Warship Movements are Erratic, Resembling Provocation <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>According to a telegram received by shipping circles yesterday morning, Japanese warships outside Zhenhai port twice shelled the Zhenhai fortress area at approximately 5 AM and 10 AM on the 25th. Damage details are unknown. A large number of Japanese warships are anchored along the coast of eastern Zhejiang, from Hangzhou Bay to outside Zhenhai port, showing no signs of withdrawing towards the South China Sea. Therefore, the situation in Zhenhai remains tense. Ningbo issued air raid alerts all day the day before yesterday. It is reported that Japanese planes flew to Zhenhai, Yin County, Fenghua, and other places, dropping bombs. Detailed information on the bombings and the extent of damage is still pending further reports. Furthermore, after the Japanese troops withdrew from Yushan Island outside Zhaobao Mountain in Zhenhai, the six Japanese warships that remained at the time sailed away the night before last.</p>
<p>Japanese Warship Movements</p>
<p>The Ningbo Shanghai Association received the following telegram regarding the situation after the recovery of Zhenhai: The day before yesterday, a Japanese warship with a single smokestack sailed out of the ocean and arrived at Huangniu Reef, then disappeared in the direction of Tingshuidou at 12:53 PM. Currently, there are still two Japanese warships anchored in the waters near Huangniu Reef. Fourteen Japanese warships were anchored in the waters off Longshan the day before yesterday, eight of which sailed northeast at approximately 10 AM the day before yesterday, leaving only six ships. Before the Japanese troops landed in Zhenhai, Japanese warships dispatched troops to occupy Yushan Island outside Zhaobao Mountain. After Zhenhai was recovered, the Japanese troops on Yushan Island were also loaded onto five Japanese warships at 12:14 PM the day before yesterday, and sailed northeast towards the Zhejiang Sea. Currently, there are still six Japanese warships anchored in the waters off Yushan Island. The twenty-six members of the temporary burial team of the Ningbo各界救護傷兵委員會 (Ningbo All Circles Relief Injured Soldiers Committee) departed at 7:30 AM the day before yesterday for the battlefields in the Xiaogang area of Jiangnan, Zhenhai, to bury corpses. This is expected to take about three days.</p>
<p>Japanese Shipping Seizure</p>
<p>According to shipping industry sources, since the complete recovery of Zhenhai, Japanese warships have fled from the coastal areas of Fujian Province. The Chinese military authorities do not prohibit foreign ships from sailing, but the Liangjiang River in Ningbo and the Jiaojiang River in Haimen have always been prohibited from entering. Those entering Xinghua, Fujian, only sail to the Jiangkou area outside Xinghua. Since the Shanghai-Zhejiang shipping routes were cut off, Japanese merchant ships have become increasingly active. The ships of the Japanese merchant company 華東海運局 (East China Shipping Bureau) have been very busy sailing to Dinghai, Shenjiamen, and other places in eastern Zhejiang. For example, at 2 PM this afternoon, the 華東輪 (East China) ship of the 華東海運局 (East China Shipping Bureau) sailed from Shanghai to Haimen.</p>

<p>The market price of coal balls has been plummeting sharply in recent days. The coal market opened as usual at 1 PM yesterday. Coal ball speculators were eager to sell, and large and small factories were competing fiercely. The market was bustling with selling, and buyers were fully stocked. Goods were abundant, and few people were inquiring. As a result, the price dropped by as much as 20 yuan per ton. The current factory price has dropped to 100 yuan per ton, and the retail price (100 market catties) is 5.50-5.60 yuan per load. The market is expected to continue to decline.</p>

<p>Chongqing, 26th—After Mr. Zhang Sixu, publisher of the Shanghai Chinese 大美晚報 (Greater Shanghai Evening News), was assassinated, the central government expressed extreme sorrow. The Ministry of Propaganda requested commendation. It has been learned that a resolution was passed by the Central Standing Committee yesterday to instruct the National Government to issue an order of recognition and provide funeral expenses. A special bereavement payment of 20,000 yuan will be granted by the central government, showing exceptional honor to Mr. Zhang's passing.</p>

<p>Regarding the issue of increasing domestic postage rates, according to a 大通社 (Datong News Agency) reporter, although this matter has been passed by both the Legislative and Executive Yuan, various issues such as the types of mail and the printing of new stamps after the rate increase are still being planned comprehensively. Therefore, it will be difficult to implement in the short term. However, according to postal sources in the southwest, there is talk of implementation on September 1st.</p>
<h3 id="e105">Inspection of French Concession Mail Still Awaiting Final Decision <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>大陸報 (Mainland News) reports that the Japanese side met with the Masnan Road post office. It is said that after Mr. Chaplain returns to Shanghai, there will be a definite statement. An official from the Shanghai Post Office recently told a reporter that rumors of the Japanese side sending personnel to inspect mail in the French Concession post office are premature. However, the Japanese side clearly has the possibility of appointing such inspectors next month. As for extending the inspection methods to post offices in the public concession, it is unlikely to happen. Negotiations are still ongoing. Mr. Chaplain, the Director of the Shanghai Postal Bureau, who went to Kunming on official business, will return to Shanghai this month. After arriving here, he will certainly participate in these negotiations.</p>
<p>Refusal to Disclose the Extent of Negotiations</p>
<p>The Japanese side's mail inspection work initially only took place at the North Sichuan Road Postal Administration. However, since the establishment of the 法日解 (French-Japanese Understanding), the Japanese side has recently taken a step further to conduct mail inspection work in the post and branch offices within the French Concession. It is reported that negotiations between the two sides have been ongoing for some time, but the final decision awaits the return of Director Chaplain from his inspection in Kunming. According to a 新聲社 (New Voice News Agency) reporter, Director Chaplain is expected to arrive here by the end of this month. Although the bureau refuses to disclose the implementation date and is unwilling to reveal the extent of mutual understanding, important postal branch offices in the French Concession have not yet received orders from the administration regarding inspection. However, it is learned that two Japanese mail inspectors, accompanied by the head of the branch office management team, went to Masnan Road last Thursday to discuss office locations and other matters. It is generally believed that the main location for mail inspection will be established at the Masnan Road post and branch office, and the office space has also been decided to be on the ground floor. A small room will be separately closed off by the post office as an office, with a staff of approximately two to four people. The date of commencement of inspection may be after Director Chaplain returns to Shanghai. Some say it will begin on August 1st.</p>

<p>All Chinese employees of the British-owned Shanghai Waterworks Company resumed work briefly the day before yesterday afternoon. The labor side expressed dissatisfaction and stayed overnight at the company the night before last. Yesterday morning, Mr. Cadori, Chairman of the company's board of directors, summoned three senior Chinese employees for a face-to-face discussion, demanding that work slowdowns not occur again in the future. After discussion, the employees' four demands—(1) subsidies and rice allowances must be benchmarked to the Municipal Council or the electricity company; (2) wages during the slowdown period should be paid as usual; (3) employees should not be dismissed without cause; (4) safety of life should be guaranteed—were rejected by Cadori. As a result, the employees resumed their work slowdown yesterday morning. At around 11 AM, Cadori ordered all Chinese employees to leave the office. The employees were outraged, declaring that the work slowdown was purely to support the workers and that they were in a passive position. If they could not be understood, they requested a one-year severance payment, this month's salary (calculated at the final month's wage rate), and savings. Cadori agreed to consider it and reply later.</p>

<p>Previously, the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce noted that the 1-fen and 5-fen aluminum subsidiary coins issued by the Banking Joint Reserve Committee were originally limited to financial circles, and their circulation was not widespread. After obtaining the agreement of the Committee, the Chamber introduced various trade associations to apply for the coins according to the quantities needed by member stores. More than ten industries have already applied. Now, in order to further promote the circulation of the coins, the Chamber of Commerce yesterday sent a circular to various trade associations to apply for them. The previous bag of 5-fen aluminum coins, which was fixed at 500 yuan, has now been changed to 250 yuan per bag, providing more convenience. As the supply of these aluminum coins to various stores for their own issued coupons is now very smooth, they should be actively withdrawn and no longer used.</p>

<p>Labor and management representatives from the British-owned Shanghai Waterworks Company's strike held talks yesterday afternoon. As a result, the company wanted to dismiss dozens of workers and require all returning workers to write letters of repentance. The workers' representatives could not accept the conditions proposed by the factory, leading to a breakdown in negotiations. The striking workers left the company entirely at around 10 PM last night. It is also reported that the workers' side proposed five conditions for resuming work: (1) dismiss White Russian workers; (2) wages during the strike period should be paid as usual; (3) reinstate dismissed workers; (4) this year's 15% wage increase promised by the factory in April should not include the 30% increase promised in 1936; (5) all subsidies should be paid as usual, plus an additional 10 yuan salary increase. They demanded that the factory accept these conditions, otherwise they would not resume work.</p>

<p>Actively developing the "New Urban Area" in Wusong, the area encompasses and requisitioned 60,000 mu of civilian farmland. The Hengchan Company came forward to offer prices for purchase, entrusted to the Fake Municipal Government Land Bureau to handle, and forcibly registered and turned in documents from the villagers. Initially, it was claimed to be a cash payment. Surprisingly, after a majority of villagers turned in their documents, the Hengchan Company, which has no credibility, paid with its own issued public bond substitutes, claiming that if households did not want these public bonds, they could exchange them for cash at the Taihe Silver Company upstairs in the Mitsui Bank in the city. It was expected that a general villager went to the bank company to apply, but it was refused. By this point, the villagers realized that the so-called purchase at a price was a complete scam. Currently, more than 700 victimized villagers will jointly request the Fake Municipal Government Land Bureau to return the deceived land so that it can be cultivated for a living.</p>

<p>At 9:45 PM last night, six puppet police officers patrolled the area of Great West Road in West Shanghai. As they passed the wooden shed of the British defense forces stationed at the intersection of Great West Road and Dingpan Road, a misunderstanding suddenly arose between the two sides, glaring at each other. The situation was quite tense for a while. The puppet police officer on guard at the post immediately reported to the nearby puppet police sub-station, which dispatched a large number of puppet police officers to the scene. Seeing a large number of puppet police arriving, the British troops also stepped up their defenses. The two sides confronted each other, each refusing to give way. Suddenly, two gunshots were heard. More and more puppet police officers gathered, and Japanese military police and detectives from the police station also rushed to the scene one after another to suppress the situation. Later, the heads of the British and Japanese armies negotiated and the misunderstanding was completely resolved. The situation did not escalate.

<p>Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, the central government has issued clear orders that all exchanges must cease trading. According to the law, non-Chinese are not allowed to establish exchanges. According to reliable sources in the gauze industry, a certain party is now colluding with scum in the gauze industry to establish a "Cotton Cloth Trading Center" with the nature of an exchange in Shanghai, which is another form of economic aggression. The establishment of this trading center has been planned for a long time, but no legitimate gauze merchants have joined to be used by it. It is said that the so-called "brokers" were originally fifty, but have recently been reduced to twenty-five, and Japanese people make up the majority of these twenty-five. All the directors are Japanese. The brokers of the Shanghai gauze merchants unanimously rejected this and hope that the few Chinese will quickly turn back from the brink.</p>

<p>Regarding the matter of the Jianghai Customs Port Affairs Division changing the wind signal on the customs flag platform, a public notice was specially issued yesterday stating that the black cross signal indicating an approaching hurricane or strong wind had been changed to two black balls strung up and down in Public Notice No. 25 on February 3, 1934. It is now decided that starting on August 1st of this year, the black ball signal will be changed to a black cross. All wind signals displayed on the flag platforms on the roof of the customs house and on the Lan Road flag platform will be changed as follows: (1) When predicting that there will be drastic changes in the weather, one black ball will be hung during the day and one red light will be hung at night. (2) When predicting that a hurricane or strong wind will rise, a black cross signal will be hung during the day, and two lights will be hung at night, side by side. This signal is only to supplement the China Sea storm signals shown by the Xujiahui Observatory signal tower on the Huangpu Beach in the French Concession, and is also to inform small boats within the port. The signal cannon indicating the approach of a hurricane will be temporarily stopped. Merchants in all trades should be aware of this, and a special notice is hereby issued.</p>
<p>Hurricane</p>
<p>The hurricane that previously swept past east of Shanghai, after hitting Nagasaki, Japan, entered the sea and dissipated. According to the 大通社 (Datong News Agency) reporter's inquiry with the Xujiahui Observatory, a new hurricane has emerged over the Pacific Ocean. According to a report at 6 AM yesterday, it has reached 17 degrees north latitude and 130 degrees east longitude, heading northwest, and the wind is not subsiding. If it continues to move in the same direction, Shanghai may be hit, so Jianghai Customs and various shipping companies are closely monitoring its trajectory.</p>

<p>Chen Zhongzheng had previously rented a vacant lot at No. 159 Changping Road from Gong Xihuai. Recently, a dispute suddenly arose between the two parties, and as a result, Chen lost the case. During the enforcement period, on the 6th of this month, upon the plaintiff's request, the Special First Court instructed bailiff Guo Tui'an and a Russian gendarme to carry out the enforcement. Surprisingly, Chen's wife, Zhang, led a group of people and brutally beat the bailiff Guo Tui'an and the Russian gendarme. According to bailiff Guo, Chen's wife said, "Why don't you show some face to the clerk? We have spent 400 yuan in the court." The bailiff arrested Chen's wife and seven others for assault and brought them to the Special First Court. Chen's wife and Zhao Jingeng were sentenced to one and a half years in prison, while the others were sentenced to eight months in prison. With regards to what Chen's wife said, bailiff Guo and the plaintiff's lawyer reported it to the Procuratorate. Prosecutor Song Genshan investigated and detained clerk Ni You'an and filed a public prosecution with the Criminal Court on charges of embezzlement.</p>
<p>Prosecution Brought on Charges of Embezzlement</p>
<p>The case was heard yesterday morning by Judge Dai Rongduo. The lawyer for Chen Zhongzheng stated that what Chen's wife said referred to the security deposit, litigation fees, and the lawyer's fees paid to the court. Defendant Ni You'an's lawyer, Wang Yaotang, argued that since there was no direct evidence proving that the defendant had committed any misconduct, he should be declared innocent. Regarding the embezzlement part, according to the agreement, the prosecutor has no right to prosecute, and the case should be declared inadmissible. Judge Dai Rongduo reported the matter and ordered that the judgment be announced at a later date. Ni You'an was released on bail of 600 yuan.</p>

She shared a room at No. 8 Qunshou Lane, Baker Road, with prostitutes Wang Huiying and Wang Gendi. Every night, she would go to various amusement venues to solicit customers. On the evening of May 2nd of this year, Wang Sanyuan met a customer named Xia Chunyun at the Daxin Amusement Park. She then went to the</p>
<p>Prostitute Wang's Residence</p>
<p>Xia, however, demanded that Wang act like a male prostitute and perform various lewd acts, which Wang firmly refused. This led to a dispute. At the time, Xia stated, "You are just a prostitute; you should comply with the customer's wishes and not be so stubborn." Wang replied that although she was selling her soul, she only knew how to please customers in a reasonable manner and was unwilling to engage in more degrading acts. Upon hearing this, Xia declared that he would</p>

<p>Banning Small Coins</p>
<p>In Tianjin, the large coins used were traditionally divided into those with base prices of 97, 69, and 96, and the coin quality was consistently pure, without any adulteration of small coins, sand coins, or Guangxu coins. Since the severe drought of the previous year, market prices have soared. Reliance on coins from Jiangsu and Zhejiang to supplement the supply has resulted in a decline in the quality of coins, but small coins were not yet in circulation. Now, the situation has worsened, with small coins accounting for one or two out of every ten coins, causing a transformation in the market. The coin industry in Tianjin is divided into two types: those with large capital, known as coin shops, are wealthy and skilled merchants who are unwilling to haggle over small coins; those with lighter capital, known as money exchange bureaus, rely on mixing coins to make a profit of one in ten. Last winter, small coins were banned, causing money exchange bureaus to be unable to sustain themselves. For example, Wanyuande and others in front of the customs gate have already closed. Now that the ban has been announced again, their source of profit has been cut off. Wenyuanmao in Houjia Bridge has stopped trading. Furthermore, An, the owner of Yuanlide shop outside the East Gate, was arrested for using small coins, severely reprimanded with a ruler, and detained as a warning. Since the ban on small coins in Tianjin, the bailiffs have been abusing their power for personal gain, going door to door to issue orders. Money exchange bureaus, fearing their searches, cannot help but offer them bribes. The bailiffs, who are familiar with the routes, repeatedly extorted Yuanlide, and An, lacking the ability to handle the situation, spoke excessively. The bailiffs, feeling embarrassed and angry, filed a complaint with the yamen, leading to his arrest and punishment. Such individuals are more than capable of ruining things but not capable of accomplishing anything. Traders should exercise caution and avoid confrontation with them.</p>

<h3 id="e132">There Are Unjust Parents <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>— Editor</p>
<p>There is an old saying in China, "There are no unjust parents in the world." It is unknown which honorable gentleman first uttered this not-so-reasonable, dogmatic saying. Promoting filial piety in China is not necessarily a bad thing; however, if children are required to unconditionally obey their parents' opinions, even if they are not necessarily right, and this is called promoting filial piety, or if children do not obey their parents' opinions, even if they are definitely wrong, and this is called children being "disobedient," then this is a bit unintelligent.</p>
<p>Children are people, and parents are also people. There is no perfect person in the world, so how can there be a person who is "not unjust," and how can one say, "There are no unjust parents in the world"?</p>
<p>Therefore, there are not only unjust children in the world but also unjust parents.</p>
<p>To resolve modern family disputes, we must first honestly regard all members of the family, both old and young, as people, as flawed people. Whether we are parents or children, we must humbly reflect on ourselves and admit that we can "be unjust" at times. This is a prerequisite for resolving family disputes.</p>
<p>However, unfortunately, the saying "There are no unjust parents in the world" has long been deeply ingrained in people's minds. To build happy and harmonious families, we must first overthrow this unreasonable saying. We must admit that parents are not necessarily right, and children are not necessarily wrong!</p>
<p>(Finally, we must add a superfluous note here to avoid misunderstandings: we are not saying that parents are necessarily wrong and children are necessarily right.)</p>

<p>— Wu Jianfen</p>
<p>Chinese Miners on Bangka Island in the Dutch East Indies</p>
<p>"Go to Nanyang to dig for gold!"</p>
<p>Chinese people set out with only a roll of bedding, a broken suitcase containing a few ragged clothes, and a pair of hands and feet willing to work hard and endure hardship. Like birds, they soared in all directions. One year, three years, five years, ten years… When they return from the tropical lands to their homeland, they are no longer the poor wretches they once were. Dressed in crisp white suits, they exude an air of foreign sophistication. Their luggage is filled with treasures and wealth. Who knows how much is hidden inside? This has often earned the amazement and envy of Europeans and natives. Mention Chinese immigrants, and they inevitably raise their thumbs and say, "喏喏, Orang仔!" Although a commoner becoming rich overnight is a very ordinary occurrence among Chinese immigrants, it is the fortune of a "blessed" individual! There is another group of Chinese immigrants who lead an inhuman, dark existence, toiling tirelessly throughout their lives, only to inevitably succumb to poverty and disease and die far from home. The "coolies" on Bangka Island in the Dutch East Indies are an even more miserable group.</p>
<p>Bangka is a small island, but it is a world-famous tin mining area. Its annual output is as high as 300,000 catties or more. The tin mining bureau (Tinwining) is operated by the Dutch, and the miners are almost all Chinese immigrants. They are all compatriots from Fujian and Guangdong. In Hong Kong, they first enter into contracts with the person in charge of the company: selling themselves for three or five years. Their daily wage is only forty cents. These are the so-called "contract workers," also known as "coolies."</p>
<p>Their treatment is meager, but they are not allowed to rest for even a moment from morning to night, as if they are iron men who will never feel tired. The food is so coarse and inferior that it is inedible: two bowls of yellow rice, a small dish of salted vegetables, half a rotten salted fish, the same as that fed to pigs. As Mr. Lu Xun said, "They eat grass, but they squeeze out milk." A little slacking off, and the supervisors will kick and punch. In the past, it was not uncommon for people to be beaten to death. Life is as worthless as grass, withered under the scorching sun, withered under the trampling.</p>
<p>Near the mines, gambling dens and brothels are rampant. The miners leave their homes and work long hours, lacking proper forms of entertainment. So they flock to gambling and prostitution. Think, a month's worth of bloody sweat is only worth a little over ten guilders, how can they afford to spend it like this? Their income cannot cover their expenses, so they borrow high-interest loans from the supervisors. Their debt piles up higher and higher, and they become more and more unable to pay it off. Year after year, they continue to sell themselves as laborers, like camels carrying heavy burdens, forever unable to complete the arduous desert journey. Many people never see the sunlight of freedom, struggling to death in the mines.</p>
<p>In recent years, although the tin mining bureau has slightly improved the treatment of miners, the miners are even more unable to stand due to the impact of the economic downturn. On the one hand, the cost of living has risen sharply; on the other hand, Javanese natives, touting "low wages," have been flocking to the mines, implementing their pushing, kicking, and squeezing tactics. Batch after batch of Chinese laborers have lost their jobs and are wandering the crossroads of foreign lands.</p>
<p>"Huh! Go to Nanyang to dig for gold?" On the ship back home, a miner from Bangka Island, spitting a mouthful of saliva, told me about their misfortune and indignation: "For us, it's simply going to Nanyang to dig our own graves!"</p>
<p>I looked at him with pity and sympathy, speechless. Scenes of starving black faces, piles of desolate graves, and a dark, horrifying picture flashed before my eyes!</p>

<p>— Written by Cheng Xiaoqing</p>
<p>Chapter Four: A Kind of Speculation</p>
<p>Ni Jinshou suddenly retorted: "There are only three—Lu Jiansheng, Yu Gantang, Zhao Boxiong. Who else?"</p>
<p>Hawthorne walked back to the chair next to the round table and sat down. "And Li Zhifan's son, who is her cousin."</p>
<p>"This person seems to have very little involvement. According to Lao Mao, he came on the seventeenth of last month and left yesterday morning. It doesn't seem like he would have much connection."</p>
<p>"That's right, but when Wang Zilan spoke with him the day before yesterday afternoon, she didn't want Zhao Boxiong and this cousin to meet, which shows that she also has some kind of relationship with this cousin. In addition, there may be a fifth or sixth person that we don't know about. Because, according to the situation last night at midnight, there may be another person of unknown relation."</p>
<p>Jinshou asked: "Are you basing this on Lao Mao's words? He said he couldn't recognize the male guest's voice?"</p>
<p>Hawthorne nodded: "Yes, that is one basis. She clearly deliberately sent Lao Mao away to see a play yesterday. If the person she met last night was one of the four we know, she wouldn't need to avoid Lao Mao's eyes. Right?"</p>
<p>Jinshou nodded in agreement. "Right, this is awkward. There are no clues about this fifth person at the moment."</p>
<p>Hawthorne continued: "Second, let's speculate about the time she returned last night. It was stiflingly hot last night in early summer, and it rained around ten o'clock. After eleven-thirty, the rain became heavier. Looking at the muddy shoe prints, she came back after the heavy rain at eleven-thirty. Third, let's speculate about her actions after she returned. After she came in, she clearly went directly to this reception room. Since she didn't go upstairs and didn't go outside again, this can be known from her one-way high-heeled shoe prints. At the same time, judging from the hierarchy of the muddy prints of three people—A, B, and herself—she came in first, followed by the B-print guest, and then the A-print guest. So, she was the first to come in, and she certainly didn't lock the door when she came in, clearly she was waiting for someone she had arranged to come."</p>
<p>Jinshou nodded repeatedly: "That's right. If she locked the door, then when the guest came, she would have to go out to open the door, so she should have two sets of footprints going in."</p>
<p>Hawthorne voluntarily said: "Soon after she returned, the expected guest arrived. This can be inferred from the fact that she didn't go upstairs and didn't change her high heels. After the guest came, she was very attentive in her hospitality, as can be seen from the leftover champagne in the glasses and the cigarette butts in the ashtray. As the playwright Mao said, they were talking under the curtains. The weather was very sultry last night, so the fact that she closed the windows and drew the curtains also proves that this guest is not only not one of the four people, but also highly secretive."

<h3 id="e137">God and Human Suffering <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>Because of selfishness, mankind has created much suffering. Those who traffic in slaves treat humans like objects, buying and selling them back and forth. The cruelty and abuse of slaves is even more severe than that of cattle and horses. Those who abduct women break up other people's families, separate their loved ones, and force the abducted women to endure a living hell. Countless poor people suffer under the oppression and exploitation of the wealthy, groaning and gasping for breath. Their suffering is truly indescribable. In general, landlords who own property build higher and higher, only caring that they can get rent, indifferent to the suffering of those living in cramped spaces. Furthermore, there are numerous bandits who act lawlessly, making a living by robbery and plunder, often causing innocent people to encounter unexpected disasters. At worst, they are robbed of their belongings; at worst, their lives are taken, leading to the destruction of families. In addition to this, there is the greatest suffering of all, which is war. Wherever there is war, suffering follows. The opposing armies on both sides inevitably have many lives lost in the crossfire, and innocent people inevitably suffer. On the battlefields of Asia, the war has been prolonged for three years without end, and the war in Europe is a long and uncertain nightmare. Everywhere, corpses are piled up, flesh and blood are flying, flames are raging, and wails fill the wilderness. Human suffering is arguably no greater than this.</p>
<p>Therefore, many people often say: There is no God in the universe. Even if there is a God, this God is not the Father of mankind as Christians say. He does not pay attention to human suffering. Furthermore, even if there is a God, and this God is truly the Father of mankind, He is powerless to stop human sin and provides no comfort for human suffering.</p>
<p>When we suddenly hear these words, they seem very insightful, but in reality, this is far from the case! Is God really powerless to stop sin? We believe that all police stations, judicial organs, and just public opinions in all countries are weapons that God helps mankind use to eradicate sin. God is even more concerned about the suffering of mankind. All Red Cross societies, orphanages, infant asylums, rescue homes, and refugee camps in all countries are comforts given by God through his perfect daughters to those who suffer. If there were no such charitable organizations in the world, how would human suffering be? How can we say that God is unrelated to human suffering? How can we say that humans do not need to acknowledge God? (Re-published on August 1st)</p>

<h3 id="e138">Films Banned in Various Countries <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>— Jun Tao</p>
<p>Generally speaking, films that are detrimental to social morality or harmful to the national image are universally banned in all countries. Sometimes, due to diplomatic stances, political, or ethnic relations, certain types of films may also be banned in certain countries. The general situation is described below:</p>
<p>In the Soviet Union, with the exception of one or two films of special significance, most American films are banned. Therefore, to date, only a few films such as "Snow White" and "The Grapes of Wrath" can be shown in the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Italy strictly prohibits the screening of films related to divorce. Even a very meaningful film, as long as it mentions divorce, will either be banned or suffer the fate of being censored.</p>
<p>If a film has an actor who is Jewish, then no matter how good the film is, it will be banned in Germany. For example, "The Last Empress" was originally a very good palace drama. However, because there was a Jewish actor in it, it still cannot be shown in Germany.</p>
<p>In Mexico, films depicting herdsmen and Indians are banned. Because there are many herdsmen in Mexico, and they are also somewhat related to the Indians in terms of race. Therefore, they believe that this type of film is an insult!</p>
<p>In British territories and colonies, films that undermine the dignity of white people are banned. The concessions are also included in this rule.</p>
<p>Norway, Denmark and other countries ban films with torture and robbers, as they believe that such films can affect the psychology of their people. Therefore, the censorship of films that are detrimental to education is particularly strict.</p>
<h3 id="e139">Gao Qingkui Will Come South with His Son-in-Law <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>— Wei Wo</p>
<p>Gao Qingkui was once as popular as Ma Lianliang is now. He was also a first-class leading actor of the Jingzhao school. Unfortunately, his voice deteriorated later, and he could not utter a word, so he could no longer perform on stage. Therefore, this first-class leading actor retired under the control of the environment. Until now, he is mainly teaching opera.</p>
<p>Recently, the Golden Grand Theater announced that the next cast after Mao Shilai will be the male lead Li Shengzao, the female lead Tong Zhiling, and the martial artist Gao Shenglin. Because Shengzao is Qingkui's son-in-law and Shenglin is Qingkui's eldest son, the Golden authorities thought of this artist whose later years were not good and sent a letter inviting Qingkui to come to Shanghai with his son and son-in-law to take care of everything. He can also arrange a few of Gao's masterpieces for Shengzao. Now Qingkui has agreed to come south. At that time, the "Presenting the Silk Robe" and "Crying at the Qin Court" and other plays that have been silent in the opera world for a long time will surely meet with us again, which is also good news.</p>
<p>As for the supporting roles of Li Shengzao's team, they are quite complete. The female lead Tong Zhiling is Xun Huisheng's favorite disciple, with a beautiful appearance and elegant demeanor. However, the Golden authorities did not dare to invite her rashly because Tong, a child actress, came south with her husband. Therefore, there is a rumor that the female lead position may be changed to Ma Yan, a female actress. According to Ma Yanfen, she is one of the best of the three Ma beauties, and she is better than Tong Zhiling. In addition, the martial artist is Gao Shenglin, the painted face is Yuan Shihai, the clown is Ru Fuhui, and the inner old man is Guan Shengxi. They are all outstanding students of Fu Liancheng and are well-known to the people of Shanghai, so I will not repeat them here. However, the original designated young male actor in this group was Jiang Shiyu, but because Shiyu could not come to Shanghai, the Golden authorities have changed to invite Ru Fulan. According to Ru Fulan, he is the only martial arts actor of Fu Liancheng. After graduation, he changed to martial artist, performing "Exploring the Village," "Night Flight," "Battle of Puyang," "Eight Great Hammers" and other plays. The north and south unanimously recommend him as the first person. Ye Shenglan's martial arts plays have the same path as Fulan, because Shenglan's martial arts plays are all taught by Fulan. Fulan's martial arts plays may be above Sun Yukun, but because of nearsightedness, it affects the performance, so he changed back to the role of young male, which is a rare talent. This time he can come south with Shengzao to perform, the people of Shanghai can be said to be very lucky, so I introduce it as above.</p>

<h3 id="e140">Gone with the Wind <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>Gone with the Wind has been showing at the Taihua Theater for several weeks. The high attendance has set a new record for the theater. The long screening time of three hours and forty-five minutes is also not a new record. I initially thought that the name might not match the reality. The people of Shanghai like novelty. Although the ticket sales were crowded, it was still not enough to inspire me to go and watch it. Later, I heard rave reviews from new friends who had already watched it, and I was also encouraged by my children, so I had to abandon my previous self-confidence. However, the film is indeed an unprecedented masterpiece. The skillful editing and the appropriate selection of actors are truly inspiring and admirable. I usually do not like to sit for a long time when watching a play, because I get tired after sitting for a long time, which is due to my physical strength. However, I sat quietly for four hours while watching this film without feeling tired. The attraction is truly great. I hope that among domestic films, there will be those who can follow in its footsteps. I think the two issues of whether the personality of the actors can match the identity of the characters in the play and the deletion of redundant performances are quite important.</p>
<h3 id="e141">Under the Eaves of Shanghai <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>I usually don't like watching Western stories in spoken dramas because they are not realistic. I also don't like ancient costume dramas very much because their gestures and movements are not as rich in beautifying art as Ping Kun dramas. The arrangement of Under the Eaves of Shanghai takes the tenants of a single building in a Shanghai alley as the theme, and reveals the forms and colors of all levels of society, either explicitly or implicitly, without adding self-criticism, waiting for the audience's evaluation and memory. It does not use extremely popular actors, but each actor's performance can accurately match the characters' situations in the play, giving the audience a deep impression. After watching it, I deeply rejoice in the progress of China's spoken drama world.</p>
<h3 id="e142">The First Shot of "Golden Star" The Cast of "Li Xiangjun" <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>The spoken drama "Li Xiangjun" is currently being staged. Its sadness, heroism, and impassionedness have won enthusiastic praise from the audience. According to the blueprint of "Li Xiangjun", "The Peach Blossom Fan" was originally a popular and timeless masterpiece, and the sensation of "Li Xiangjun" is not accidental.</p>
<p>While the spoken drama "Li Xiangjun" is being staged, the film "Li Xiangjun" is also being actively filmed by the Golden Star Company. With the characteristics of the film, it will naturally attract more attention. In terms of actors, the cast is also quite strong. The reporter has learned the following main candidates from the Golden Star Company:</p>
<p>Li Xiangjun…Gu Lanjun</p>
<p>Hou Chaozong…Bai Yun</p>
<p>Li Zhenli…Yuan Shaomei</p>
