<h3>日方提出新要求　越督德古已予以拒絕　日以哀的美敦書限法方三日答覆　雙方談判破裂越南局勢極度緊張</h3>
<p>香港　據消息靈通方面人士稱、法日之越南談判已吿破裂、情勢極爲嚴重、（二十日電）</p>
<p>香港　據此間靈通方面消息、法當局與日本視察團在河內之談判、已切實破裂、越南局勢甚爲危急、聞談判破裂之促成、係由於雙方商定允許日軍（聞人數爲二萬五千名）通過越南而至滇省邊境後、日軍又提出進步要求、越督德古對於此項續提要求已加拒絕、聞其內容係關於維希協定範圍以外之各根據地、且認爲與日本對華之軍事毫無必要、河內日僑傳已準備撤至海防該處有日輸一艘正在等候、（二十日路透電）</p>
<p>重慶　此間政府權威方面、頃對河內消息所稱日代表團領袖西原少將、已向法當局送第二次最後通牒之訊、非常注意、兩日中、重慶昆明間之無綫電、忙碌不停、緣此兩城市之主要官吏、對採取步驟應忖越局一節正在交換意見與情報、政界大多均認、河內局勢之急轉直下、恐卽在數日之內、並預料法國將採更堅强之態度、（二十日合衆社電）</p>
<p>香港　據權威方面消息、日方已向越南提出哀的美敦書、限七十二小時答復、九月二十而日午夜滿限、但此訊尙未經官塲證實、（二十日路透電）</p>
<p>香港　雖有廣州灣傳來尙未微實之消息、內稱日領館人員及日方監視團已奉命於今日退出河內、然現聞越督德古與日代表西原之談判、業已成立妥洽、准許日兵二萬五千人與軍用品在海防登陸、以便經過越南而往滇邊、駐港日總領事岡崎聲稱、渠未接有關於出境事之情報、又聞法當局已備專車、供日人使用、以便載往海防、日艦一艘、刻候於海防、（二十日路透電）</p>
<p>香港　廣西傳來消息稱、日軍在越南登陸之舉若停滯、則對於其攻滇計劃大爲不利、據水口關消息、日軍尙無越桂邊而入越南者、此閒接獲華方軍界消息稱、滇桂華軍現正監視鎭南關與龍州之日軍、並稱在桂之日軍司令、因鑒於英美在遠東合作之日趨可能、故不敢貿然派兵入越、但日軍每停滯一日、則英美合作卽接近一步、日在越邊之兵力、據河內維希柬京之新聞報道、各不相同、北海華方消息、日軍有四師之衆、分駐欽縣海南及溷洲羣島、共十萬人、據謂萬一發生衝突、此十萬人卽由海道至海防、而在鎭南關之日軍、則西趨而入唐當、（譯音）廣州以北及東江一帶、因日軍移至廣西海南及溷洲羣島、故過去二星期內平靜無事、華南主要戰事、刻在南寗龍州問之上思縣、（二十日國際社電）</p>
<p>東京　今日外務省發言人須磨向各報訪員談稱、曰法當局在河內之談判、雖尙未臻於諒解、惟進行甚爲順利、某訪員叩以日軍曾吾在越南任何地方登陸、該發言人鄭重答稱、渠敢斷言日軍並未在越南登陸、且日本在未與越當局獲得諒解之前、亦無須派軍登陸、該發言人又稱、外報所載中法兩軍在越南邊境附近發生銜突之說、尙無官報證實云、（二十日路透電）</p>
<p>河內　自日方昨晚向法當局提出新的哀的美敦後、日僑及日軍代表團人員、急急撤離河內、致安南方面、今日形勢異常緊張、據法方官員宜稱、日方昨夜、曾向法國提出一維希政府決難接受之新的要求、又消息靈通方面透露、日方所提新要求、完全係以哀的美敦書形式出之、聞其限期乃至本星期六日午夜爲止、（二十日合衆電）</p>
<p>河內　此間對於法國戰艦六艘之行動、頗爲注意、按此等戰艦、始於本週、經英國特許、得以取道直布羅陀海峽、有數方面相信、該等戰艦、顯然未能迅速到達、以應付目前緊張之情勢、然其駛程、則係赴安南無疑也、昨晚安南官員、顯已決定拒絕日方之哀的美敦書、而駐安南之法軍、亦已準備就緒、予來侵之日人以抗拒、衆信若法方一旦於哀的美敦限期屆滿前、斷然拒絕日本之要求、則日方或將以陸海兩軍聯合進犯安南、廣東方面日軍、業已以大軍屯駐集中於安南邊界、日本海軍則集中於安南所屬之水面、有數方面深信、日本所提新要求、除經濟方面之特殊利益外、主要者厥爲在安南之永久的海空根據地、至於日本前者耍求假道安南、實不過上開新的耍求之烟慕耳、（二十日路透電）</p>
<p>東京　據「讀賣新聞」載稱、關於泰國軍隊侵入越南、及泰國飛機飛入越南領空之消息、已由泰國政府加以吾認云、（二十日海通電）</p>
<h3>西原發表警吿語　謂情勢將益惡劣</h3>
<p>河內　日代表團領袖西原少將、頃發表警吿之語、謂日本之最後通牒、將於星期日晚滿限、設法日談判、完全破裂、卽情勢將更趨惡劣、而渠已準備離海防赴東京西原稱、日僑今日之撤退、尙非爲其眞正之危機到臨、叉稱、渠已準備今日離開河內、設談判趨於「予巳認爲無望之境、則「予將返東京」、設法國拒絕日本要求、則日人應採何種步驟、將由東京決定、要求之答覆、現已設有時間上之限制、西原並吾認新要求係出乎維希東京協定範圍以外、謂日代表團、係嚴密依照維希東京協定行事、西原指責法國採用遲延態度、謂東京協定、已於三星期前簽字、而法方仍未依約履行、西原又指資法方對日方之建議、輒置之不理、據此間官方宣布、法日談判、仍在進行、但法國恐不致接受任何超越維希東京協定範圍以外之要求、目下越南局勢頗爲危急、但又甚混沌、因日方之新要求、並未宣布、惟聞係與九月二日之耍求相同、西原少將、對記者以美國務卿赫爾最近聲明、美對越南現狀至爲關懐、一節相詢、答稱、越南現狀並未受威脅、越南之領土完整、亦未受危害、西原並諒目前法日之關係、正與英美兩國目前合作之情形相同、雖日僑自河內撤向海防而日人仍具自持之概、此種自持之氣概、已表現於日代表團人員行動中、蓋渠等均以日元給付之旅館侍役酒資、並稱、日本通貨、不可通用於越南、西原少將係在警衛森嚴之日代表團、總部中接見美國各記者、該總部係設於一政府屋宇之內、西原力言日人對法人之感情非常友好、日人並無仇視法人之意、此間日僑一百四十七人、連日代表團人員若干在內、已於今晨高唱日本國歌、乘坐專車赴海防、當日人聚集車站月台、高唱日本國歌之際、法人及安南人皆佇立注視不輟、至其餘高級之日代表團官員、聞將於今日午後乘汽車赴海防云、（二十日合衆社電）</p>
<h3>日僑急遽謀撤退　談判入微妙階段</h3>
<p>河內　法日雙方爲日本要求安南事件所開談判、迄至昨夜、幾已瀕於決裂之境、據法方官報述稱、自日本提出與「維希政府訓令大相逕庭及完全離乎法日協定正軌」之新要求後、該一談判、遽已轉「微弱狀態」中矣、法方官報雖云談判仍在繼續中、據日本則顯已準備談判決裂後之方策、昨夜日僑四百人、接獲命令、須急行撤離安南、至遲亦不得過今日、多數日人、已於今晨乘專車由河內至海防、有重四噸半之行李、於昨晚即已運往海防、該處且預停有日艦三艘、專爲撤退日僑之用、聞該等艦艇、係受命令前來者、候各撤退日僑登輪後、尙須等待命令、始能開駛、日軍代表團人員、亦宣稱準備撒離河內、但代表團領袖西原、則將在此間勾留數日、始能成行、昨晚西原氏曾往訪越南總督德古克斯及其夫人、衆認此一拜訪、實不營一「告別」之拜會、（二十日台衆社電）</p>
<p>河內　日本駐越南各地領事、業爲該國僑民作登船撤退之準備、此項措置、初無確切事實足爲根據、但越南總督已予以種種便利、頃悉日本代表團曾提出新要求、其性質似已踰越法日雙方在原則上所訂協定之範圍、而與越南當局所接得之訓令、難以融洽、職是之故、業已進入微妙階段、雙方現正賡續進行討論、（二十日哈瓦斯社電）</p>
<p>海防　據法國官方消息、法日在河內之談判、已臻「微妙」之階段、聞日方提出設立根據地之要求、此項要求不在維希協定範圍以內、且與對華戰事無關、越南全部之日僑今在表面上聚集一地、預備撤退、今日將有專車一列、由河內開往海防、專載日僑、惟日當局尙未下撤退之命令、據日陸軍發言人曰、雙方談判刻仍在進行中、吾人對於談判之獲圓滿結局、仍抱樂觀云、（二十日路透電）</p>
<h3>法外長向美表示　將允許日軍通過</h3>
<p>紐約　法國外長鮑多恩、昨在維希吿美報記者稱、法國將接受日方派軍經過越南之要求、法國不能盼望英美之援手、故貝當政府必採取現實政策、以保法國殖民地、（二十日路透社電）</p>
<p>維希　今日法外長鮑陀音於接見美新聞記者代表時聲稱、法國頃接受其未來意外之事、並須屈服於日假道越南之要求、鮑氏稱、法國不能希望英美之援手、因此須遵行一現實政策、以保國家之安全、「法國現正單獨與日人作談判、」鮑氏此言與德國對越南事件正在指導維希政府之謠傳止相矛盾，鮑氏又稱、日政府於六月十三日卽提出假道越南之要求、按是日卽爲魏剛將軍向德義請求休戰之日、進行與日方談判者、爲越督德古中將、然日方表示不滿，復於八月二日提出新要求、鮑氏稱法人雖處於日本武力佔領威脅下、然對日方新要求之談判、則加以拒絕、蓋日方斯時之要求、極不合理、氏稱、「吾人承認日本爲遠東最强之國、吾人擬遵從現實政策、以保法國之利益與統一、吾人已將自最初起之談判進行情形、通知美政府矣、越南至今尙在英政府在遠東勢力下而存在、但吾人須單獨行動、蓋英美方面除外交援助外、吾人不能更有所希冀也、（二十日國際社電）</p>
<p>華盛頓　東部沿海各大都市之報紙、雖皆登戰特殊消息稱、法已決定允許日軍假道越南、但國務卿赫爾於昨日深夜宣稱、尙未獲得官方證實其事之報吿、赫爾父謂、日侵越南、美國堅决反對、美國之此項政策、舉世皆知、至於外傳法已决定允許日軍開入越南一節、則彼仍在等待官方之證以下接第四版</p>

<p>社評</p>
<h3>法幣正常之來蹤去跡</h3>
<p>上海市塲嘗傳大宗新鈔自英美運到重慶之說，於是訛言四出；買空賣空之徒允欣然奔走相告曰：此則通貨膨脹之證，物價昂貴之媒、亦爲法幣基礎趨於薄弱之明徵云云。誅其心，蓋以爲必如此掀風播浪，庶幾乎又是發財機會。然而幼穉之甚。信如彼說，彼譎詐所得之累累法幣，尙有珍視價值乎？若日不幼穉，事爲別有作用於其間。然處此瘡痍滿目，經濟行爲一切不得自由之今日，能保別有所獲而彼善於此乎？此又稍有常識者類能道之。要知法幣者，今日中國唯一之通貨，亦爲中國經濟之所托命；彼爲通貨膨脹之說者，是不明中國地廣人庶；又不明中國舊時之金融機構，貨幣龐雜，及法幣暢行，銀圓集中，中國貨幣統一行使之後，法幣自有其必然之擴張性也。乃徒以略識皮毛，濫用術語，以爲新鈔流行，便是通貨膨脹，便是影響物價。其爲不明事理，則不免膠柱鼓瑟之譏：其爲欺世駭俗，則意在搗亂，陰謀破壞而已。</p>
<p>在貨幣統一之過程之中，法幣發行額之增加，乃爲適應事實之需妥所必然；非如幣制早經統一，發行早經集中，而紙幣發行額驟趨膨脹，以適應其財政需妥者所可同日語也。姑不論中國法幣發行額之增加，爲應有之舉；即退一步以論今日物價之上漲，是吾受法幣發行增加之影響、抑係法幣發行之所以增加，反受物價上漲，籌碼小敷應用之影響，此不難求之於兩者發展之比率而判斷之，蓋按之物價，其上漲之率，往往五六倍於戰前；而法幣發行額之增加，何嘗若此之巨且速？更以中國人口總數之衆，雜幣雜鈔銷滅之勢，兩相比較，則僅此法幣爲籌碼，其不敷之數，一望而知其相差遠甚，况中中交農所公布，對於舊鈔，正在陸續收回，公開辦理，則以新換舊，便利授受，是亦添發新鈔必由之途徑。今不此着想，而惟盲目的以新鈔增加爲言，遽指爲通貨膨脹，有是理乎？夫膨脹云云，固爲一比較之詞，今比昔多爲膨脹，今比昔少爲緊縮；而膨脹與緊縮之程度，亦自各有其分寸，越此自然應有之分寸，其多其少，方有膨脹與緊縮之可言。至於今日物價之飛漲，正由於（一）淪陷區農工事業摧毀甚巨，生產减少；即有生產，又亂遭榨取而外流。（二）有向外匯進攻者，使中國當局放棄維持之政策，一任黑市之自生自滅，自漲自落，卒以供求不予調劑而趨於短縮，於是貨價高矣。（三）沿海交通，常遭封鎖，貨運失其調節，物價自然軒輊。（四）則淪陷區內備受「統制」，巧取豪奪，於是生產者所受巨大之損失，不得不取償於自由買賣之物價，物價遂不能不高。此四者，其大較也。更因物價高漲，小額貨幣反有授受不便之累而不得不用額面較高之貨幣以代之；此觀於近來零售物價漸高，一分幣需要愈少，漸有以五分爲零售單位之趨勢；則紙幣之遞進由一圓而五圓十圓，乃至五十元百元，照目前形勢，自有其必要。何况此番所印之鈔票，乃所以「解除自由中國境內鈔票缺乏之恐慌」，夫「缺乏」而至於發生「恐慌」，其爲過量不足可知。因「不足」而「足」之則新鈔發行，自非膨脹可比，更何有於流入淪陷區之事，而肆其簧鼓者，亦可見其爲詞遁矣。</p>
<p>自由中國鈔票何至於發生缺乏恐慌，以意度之，當爲一則正見法幣推行之順利，如川滇康藏向係用銀之地方，今亦改用法幣，而法幣之需要自增。二則民間資金向外逃避，此在時局不安之今日，亦無庸諱，逃避之結果，勢必使法幣流通有彼盈此絀之虞。如上海方爲海內外逃避資金之集中點、因之反感游資充斥，投機盛行，促進物價之漲風。故欲使通貨之終於不膨脹，是不難，（一）則鈔票過多之地方，向鈔票不足之地方移動，劑之使平。（二）减低活期存款之利息，提高定期儲蓄存款之利息，而使游資經金融界之手，歸於正當之用途。（三）收買新舊公債，不但利益優厚，且有政府担保，可無投機所有之危險；誠以今日作商品投機者，失敗之機會多，獲利之機會少，非同去年可比也。（四）由銀團或企業投資團作內地開發之有規畫的事業，徵求各界投資，而由政府保息。凡此皆使游資入於正當之用途，亦即收束市塲鬆濫之籌碼，抑制投機之一策也。實、國務院官員指稱、國務卿對東京、曾先後發出三次外交上之警告、皆係關於擾亂遠東領土現狀者、不論日侵何地、皆與美國之意見相抵觸、（二十日國際社電）</p>

<h3>歐戰叢談（上）　貢巴臬　森林中的悲劇</h3>
<p>這一輛老式的2419D餐車原係美國加州人弗萊明設計造成，藏在七十五碼外的一個博物院中。此次簽字前一星期，德國工程師遵從希特勒之命，把它搬運至指定的歷史意義地點。在塲的新聞記者們，從塵挨封滿的車窗，看見希特勒坐在福煦像前，他生前曾坐過的椅子中。左右爲戈林和季台爾；白羅傑區和赫斯坐在一面；賴德和里賓特洛甫坐在另一面。對面一端留着四個空位。</p>
<p>三時三十分，四個法國代表坐着汽車在阿爾薩斯洛倫紀念碑前下車。他們是洪齊格將軍，身穿茶褐色軍服；空軍將官柏奇萊將軍；海軍中將勒魯克，均穿深藍衣制服；前任波蘭大使諾爾，身穿政界之陸軍便服，諸代表行經卐字旗所遮蓋的戰勝紀念碑前時，忽忽一顧，卽向前行去，其旁有德方軍官三人相隨。德軍衛隊咸向法代表行禮。</p>
<p>法代表登車後，德方諸領袖均起立爲禮儀容肅然。希特勒以國社黨敬禮，依次與法代表相見。戈林與賴德舉官杖爲禮。白羅傑區及季台爾兩人行軍禮，赫斯及里賓特洛甫則舉臂行國社黨禮。法代表報之以軍禮。希特勒旋卽就座，點頭示意季台爾將軍，季德爾卽以沉着的語調，用德語宣讀希特勒所提停戰條件的序言略謂：二九一八年十一月十一日，在這輛火車中，德國人民遭受痛苦的時代，從此開塲……一九三九年九月三日，……英法毫無理由，又向德國宣戰。現在由於火力的判決，德國被請提出休戰條件了。倘然把歷史上的貢巴臬森林擇爲授受這條件的塲所，這倒也是一勞永逸，恰合事理的，從這公牛的報應舉動，正好把那在法國不足爲榮，德方深以爲恥的一種紀念，一掃而凈。法國於幾經血戰，英雄抵抗之後，業已解體。德國並不欲以虐待性質的條件加諸勇敢的敵人身上」。</p>
<p>三時四十二分，希特勒起立爲禮，旋卽下車。除季台爾將軍外，德方諸領袖亦卽隨之而去。他們走過衛隊之前，樂聲大作。不多一會，他們登上汽車，在貢巴臬森林的柯枝葉條之下，馳車返回光榮的德國。這里在2419D餐車中，季台爾站在綠呢面子的桌子前，把停戰條件逐條向法國四代表宣讀。談判時概用德文，法方代表對於德文非常練熟，首席代表洪齊格將軍，他本是阿爾薩斯人呢。</p>
<p>四時二十六分，太陽照在森林的背面，空塲中已有些蔭影沉沉的樣子了。法國代表這時走下餐車，退入塲邊的一個小篷帳中。裏面有四隻木椅子，一張桌子，和一架洗手具。桌子上面還放了一束玫瑰花。每個坐位前置有一個文書夾，一個日歷正標着這可紀念的六月二十一日。電話電報都可直通波爾多，那里貝當將軍正和閣員們，引領佇踵的要聽取這方消息呢。季台爾將軍所授予法方的條件草本共有三十頁紙，完全法文。他在法方代表退入篷帳磋商時，便抽空下車在森林裏踱了一會。</p>
<p>那天晚上，法方代表曾向巴黎西南驅車五十二英里，穿過了九時起實行宵禁的冷落街道，在一家旅館中耽擱一夜。第二天早晨返抵森林空塲的小篷帳裏。季台爾將軍把餐車給他們使用，車內多添了五位秘書，法方代表把逐條條文細細硏究。差不多每一條都要和波爾多方面詳爲磋商；每一條都要取得季台爾將軍的同意，他外表執禮彬彬，而態度却十分堅決。這第二天午後，季台爾差人吿訴法方代表，說是時間已很短促了。法方首席代表洪齊格將軍回答說，法方已準備就緒了。於是法德雙方又在那綠呢面子的桌上商談一切。</p>
<p>洪齊格將軍對德代表說：「法國代表團認爲尙有一言，須加陳述。法國在戰敗之餘，放棄武力抵抗，亟望今後以此種磋商的精神，再使兩國獲得共同生存，與互相合作的機會。足下以軍人的立塲，當知此痛苦時間之來臨我身爲如何也」。季台爾將軍回答道：「我接受你的話……我祇能回答戰勝者給予戰敗者的光榮是値得尊敬的」。</p>
<p>在雙方代表講了幾句話之後，法國海軍中將勒魯克把手拭去他頰上的眼淚。颼颼的一陣輕微的筆尖聲中，夾着一句法語道：「將軍，請授筆給我」，第二陣的簽字聲音又起了。這時候正是德國夏季鐘點下午六時五十分正。</p>
<p>四個法國代表，在貢巴臬森林中簽完了字，已是精神勞頓，坐了汽車開到慕尼克，希特勒和墨索里尼已在那里談妥了他們的聯合停戰條約。安睡一宵，德國軍用機父把法代表團送到羅馬。聽取義大利方面的條件。在羅馬近郊十二英里，十七世紀式的茵雪榭別莊中，法國代表團和義大利外長齊亞諾，參謀長巴陀根里沃上將海軍上將卡伐那利，及潑立柯羅將軍等晤面。雖然法國沒有法子不接受義方所提的條件，但法代表團曾以二十四小時的長時間與波爾多方面磋商。直到義大利夏季鐘點下午七時十五分，卽法德簽訂停戰條約後二日，法方洪齊格將軍與義方巴陀格里沃將軍簽完了第二個停戰條約。</p>
<p>一九四〇年六月二十五日，德義夏季鐘點上午一時三十五分，法境的戰事完全吿終。希特勒昭告國人說：「感謝上蒼賜福，德國境內應懸旗十日，鳴鐘七天。」法國則規定這一天爲國恥紀念日。波爾多的報紙說，法蘭西不僅戰敗，一切組織和體制也大受損傷。一二十年來的錯誤罪過，至此吿一段落。</p>

<h3>利多消息突來　金市跌後重振</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤市况、初時趨勢平疲、不意晚收前突吿重漲、先以現金號及證券帮頻施壓力、目午刻再引起一般浮戶傾向出售、當日最低曾現六千一百九十五元、午後初開靜寂、三時許忽傳日方對越已提出愛的美敦書、限七十二小時答覆、及種種混亂利多消息、匯市復現微緊、遂起相當買風、一度哄至六千二百九十元高盤、惟結果因獲利浮多吐出、故晚收回低達六千二百六十五元、較上日軋漲四十七元、全天交易約四千兩左右、銀樓飾金始終未動、海關金等仍平、</p>
<p>烚赤漲四十七元</p>
<p>晨初市况平靜、首由銀號出金號十兩、爲六千二百十五元、比前收撳小三元、繼因賣戶尙多、續降五元、退爲六千二百十元、旋匯市微緊、激起買風、錢兌業銀號等爭先收買、遂步漲至六千二百四十元、奈此後外匯止緊趨平、金號帮頻來吐售、且不久證券帮跟之拋空、市勢頻轉向下、十一時半竟慘入六千二百元關、現六千一百九十五元低價、後賣戶减少、再賴錢兌業拉提、會回引至六千二百十兀、卒因浮多以貼出利息過昂、遂來復吐、故午收僅吿六千二百元、午後開市、金號首入銀號十兩、爲六千二百十元、嗣曾微跌五元、但不久某金號突來在扒、而斯時銀號帮居間塞出、是以漲勢尙緩、未幾抬至六千二百二十元、後復又小達六千二百十五元、不意此後買風突吿擴大、因傳越南之種種利多消息、並匯市走緊、激動人心、金號錢兌業力扒、銀號帮亦反出爲地、一度竟高達六千二百九十元、三時一刻後、買風漸散、而匯市已吿稍平、頓引起一般獲利吐出、某金號亦從中了結、故收盤前退至六千二百五十八元、惟結果因人心仍堅、晚收尙有六千二百六十五元、較隔昨軋漲四十七元、全天九十五元上落、現金號之本脾金售出價、照烚赤較高十數元、收進减低三十元、現標金照牌金低五十餘元、均鮮做開、</p>

<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出終日未動、大同行仍懸六百四十元、新同行與上價相同、收進减低三十元光景、</p>
<h3>外幣傍晚轉堅</h3>

<h3>糧食　新米旺登　洋米續到三萬包</h3>
<p>現洋米暗盤，近因國米由滬郊陸續運申者日有二三千包、係各米號直接收售、故市塲交易、反形冷淡、唯有所謂皮球生意者、時出時進、造成無形之漲落、近日此種皮球生意者似較平靜、但因產價關係、賣方心思仍堅、市乃頓見加起五六角、然漲後浮戶紛紛出籠、實銷完全停手，且貨方亦無操縱之利用、市乃立隨人心回平下趨、午市步小六七角、結果大部份與前市相似、少數則小一二角、西貢大市一號與火絞均祇穴十七元、暹邏一號六十六元、又二號六十一元半，小絞六十一元八角、二號西貢六十二元半、又碎米五十三元、砶米五十六元七角、英華司西貢暹邏均喊七十三元左右均有成交、現米交易亦祇有三千包、</p>
<p>洋米近日又源源而來、前日怡和洋行定生輪、太古公司太原輪等、自香港運來洋米、已誌前報、昨午太古公司山東輪自香港到滬、亦運來洋米四千二百八十八包、停靠法租界本行碼頭起卸、華綸洋行海達輪、此次由西直接裝來洋米二萬六千餘包、於本星期日（十五日）抵吳淞口時、遭某方阻撓、致不能進口、在口外拋泊五日、昨晨始進口、現沿浦東鴻與碼頭起卸、</p>

<h3>鳳凰粉結價　議定十五元七　小麥稍有供應</h3>
<p>麵粉　昨日現粉續俏、因福阜兩廠供給有限、不敷本街需求、各店門售每包須十六元八角、尙無餘額供給、聞本街昨向阜豐廠購辦紅桃花牌四號粉二千餘包、價爲十五元二三角、以應門市需用、其餘如內地粉及洋粉等均一再喊高而乏妥交、日廠鳳凰牌期粉已決定不問成交價格高低、全部結價、聞此事經買賣議定爲十五元七角爲結價、刻正在商酌辦理、市塲交易、則繼續停頓、</p>
<p>小麥　昨小麥稍有供應、因太倉丹陽及滁州等處稍有運到、爲數不多、日廠匯價祗二十一元左右、貨方不願出售、故送廠解卸者額僅一二千包、華廠昨收匯丹陽及太倉等麥二千餘包、價二十四元六角至六角半、又聞內地帮亦辦去滁州新麥一百包、價二十四元六角半、市面堅定、</p>
<h3>證券　內債盤小</h3>
<p>證券暗盤、昨日市况稍有波動、直綫下瀉六七角後、稍稍回起、檯面似稍轉堅因自晨初開盤後、一路盤小、直至下午收盤相近時、始稍稍抬高、檯面搶帽子者、忽多忽空、隨時變遷、昨日經過、上午開盤七號四十一號同康稍有買進、永豐恒孚爲賣出、市價回小三五角、午後繼續疲軟、丙種曾敲破四元關入後永康同康大通等頗有進胃、檯面復又隨波逐流、由空翻多、丙種又復抬高數角、但賣戶如順昌聯和恒孚永豐等繼續出脫、故市價結果仍比隔日小二三角左右、成交數約八九十萬元、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>股票交易、成交華商電氣股六百股、價爲六元正、　衆業公所昨日晚市開盤、承前日堅勢、各股復普遍上漲、會德豐在八十六元、六元半價大量成交、晨初因越南消息、略現騷動、價格波動甚劇、但無絲毫趨軟現象、實業股之成交極爲普遍、橡皮股則甚呆滯、</p>

<h3>紗花　大投機乘高出籠　棉紗由高而低</h3>
<p>上日趨升之紗市、昨則復入迴旋之途、此因港幫採辦較上日大爲减色、故多方雖抬持不放、然鑒於實際地位並無顯著的進展、所以將多額稍形放出、因之市盤由高向低、惟大衆心理仍屬傾向做多、總之存貨籌碼充足、非客銷接踵而來扶植、市面難以向榮也、</p>
<p>現紗　開因上日市况堅挺、多頭再來做作、喊高聲紛亂、然有一大部份大投機者、乘機出籠、二十支雙馬首盤價爲一千〇十九元、賣者紛繁、於面頓見鬆懈、同時謠說又見寗靜市盤乃由昂轉歡、跌至一千〇〇四元、旋經多頭復來補空、而收進幾包、重行回至一千〇〇七元收盤、查半日間成交統計三千一百四十五包、行情二十支雙馬漲二元半、茲將各幫買去之額量、分列如左、</p>

<p>另訊外棉市價、紐約棉市、晨初先因投機者之購買、後因現貨交易之良好、及華爾街之購買、結果收盤價格、較之上日漲八九磅音、印度昨日降落一羅比、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、日來又稍見活躍、蓋因紗價之鬆動也、廠方祇零星交易、選取售價低廉者、稍進購而已、日方則傳繼續减工之說、故日來並無交易聞也、</p>
<h3>絲茶　日絲來滬推銷　受美國節用影響</h3>
<p>據某洋行消息、最近間將有日絲來滬、且聞其樣絲兩箱、業已運到該項生絲乃用二條絲抱合成線、最合綢廠應用、又聞今年日本生絲產量約爲七十一萬包、較去年减百分之十七、然目下歐銷斷絕、美銷復因新人造絲納瓏」、在美頗爲得勢、（美國四百九十四家、襪廠中巳有四十七家完全採用納瓏製襪）、故邇來日絲在美實銷、常在一五·〇〇〇包左右、然則年合十八萬包之數、日絲勢將過剩之五十三萬包別翁出路、故近日聞日絲來滬、論情勢、甚有可能也、惟日絲成本較華絲爲昂、中國綢廠、恐不能受用也、</p>
<h3>疋頭　蘇浙皖布銷　日商獨占</h3>
<p>布市趨勢平淡、實銷不振、蓋以粵·閩·浙東各帮貨運時續時斷、辦貨未能暢旺、而蘇浙皖游擊區布銷有全部歸日商行獨占之說、市氣益形黯淡、囤戶亦乏興緻、昨布價頗少軒輊、手貨較廠盤廉二角半之譜、本街成交坯布·色布絨布等三百餘件、浙閩幫辦色布粗布等二百餘件、粤港帮辦二百數十件、北路烟台幫辦重磅粗布等近百件、二十一日運烟台二千〇三十件、</p>
<p>東市客路交易寥寥、而市塲上之心思買資稍形熱鬧售盤微昂、十二磅龍頭細布後市收盤爲三十二元七角半，四君子嗶嘰售開每碼九角二分二厘半、</p>

<p>新江北綫粉干近到二十四元、因値貨底空虛、市勢頗佳、開至八十五元、亦新高價也、</p>
<h3>油餅　生油大落</h3>
<p>昨日油市、惟豆油市氣和緩、因各方均行注意生油、買賣範圍有限、行情仍守原價、計成交大連油二十桶、凈油一百擔、及大有餘廠油三百五十擔、花生油因投機熱烈、故其起伏波浪、千變萬化、令人莫測、晨初承上日疲風、開盤卽跌、入後盛傳靑鳥方面雖報續漲、但由日商收買、有運滬之說、以致人心紛亂、拋售允殷、市價頻跌、結果收盤時略形回升、然比上日仍跌二元外、現貨難免牽動，且來源叉接、故亦挫修二元、做開烟台生油七十件、價爲六十六元、膠州生油一百五十件，六十六元半至六十六元、訂九月下交二百五十件，價同現油、訂十月上交五百件、價爲六十七元五角至六十六元五角、十月下交二千餘件、價自六十九元跌至六十七元五角、收盤爲六十八元、靑島生油成交一百桶、價爲九十三元、訂十月上交五十桶、亦爲九十三元、訂十一月上交一百桶、九十三元五角、</p>

<h3>公共租界電車工人　突發生罷工風潮　各路車輛昨晨均吿停駛　工部局極重視已予調處</h3>
<p>英商電車公司倍開而路車廠銅匠間工人五百人、因生活艱難、於本月十日向公司當局要求改善待遇不遂、於前晨（十九日）實行怠工後、昨晨五時、該公司售票司機二千人、突亦加入怠工、致事態擴大、該公司業務、已無法繼續、昨日公共租界各路有軌無軌電車、竟吿全部停頓、致本市交通、陷入嚴重境地、此次售票司機之怠工、其起因亦為要求改善待遇不遂之故、但據資方之消息、則稱怠工工人、事前絕未與公司當局磋商、於怠工後始提出要求條件、現此項工潮、因影響殊大、租界當局頗為重視、昨日工部局工業科及警務處政治部、均巳派員調查、並於下午竭力設法、使雙方爭執和平解決</p>
<p>工人提出四項要求</p>
<p>該公司銅匠·售票·司機三部工人、向資方提出改善待遇耍求四項、（一）公司原有米貼取消、每人按月發米五斗、（二）每一工人每日發給雜費一元、（三）工人工作每小時增加工資五分、（四）短工滿六個月以上者、作長工論、按以上條件、原係銅匠間工人於十九日下午二時向該公司代理經理提出、因遭拒絕、遂先怠工、至昨日始與售票司機取一致行動、</p>
<p>各路車輛全部停駛</p>
<p>因售票司機之全體罷工、以致該公司之車輛、均未出廠、全部停駛、計（甲）有軌電車一路外灘至靜安寺、二路洋涇浜至靜安寺、三路東新橋至麥根路、五路小北門至北站、六路圓路、（乙）無軌電車十四路鄭家木橋至北站、十六路三洋涇橋至曹家渡、十七路打浦橋至四川路橋、十八路斜橋至北站、十九路三洋涇橋至宜昌路、二十路兆豐公園至新關碼頭、二十一路四川路橋至宜昌路、二十四路小沙渡路至西門、因英商電車之罷工、法商之五路有軌及十七十八路無軌電車、亦中止駛往公共租界部份、</p>
<p>公共汽車乘客擁擠</p>
<p>自電車完全停頓後、公共租界之交通、現已僅賴英商公共汽車維持、昨傳該公司銅匠間一部份工人、亦吿怠工、但該公司職員、則予吾認、昨日各路英商公共汽車、仍照舊行駛、且因電車停駛之故、業務頓吿繁忙、為使公共汽車不致過於擁擠起見、昨日該公司特加撥公共汽車十數輛、加入各綫行駛、以應乘客需要、</p>
<p>當局重視竭力調處</p>
<p>公共租界工部局政治部及工業科、以電車為公共交通工具若工潮任令遷延、影響租界之秩序頗鉅、故特派探長高延根及顧炳元等、分往公司及勞方進行調處、惟以雙方意旨、尙難接近、致未解決、決繼續進行勸導、警務處當局、因恐罷工工人引起其他糾紛、故特在派遣大批警探分駐於蘇州路總公司、華盛路工廠·靜安寺車工廠·赫德路車棧·倍開爾路材料處等各處、藉資保護、</p>
<p>法租界內照常開駛</p>
<p>因英商電車停駛之影饗、昨日法租界電車一律停止駛入公共租界、十七路無軌電車、由打浦橋駛至大世界為止、十八路僅駛斜橋至大世界一段、廿四路由西門經辣斐德路至亞爾培路福煦路為止、由西門駛至北火車站三五路、因營業重心、素在公共租界、故法界一段亦吿停駛、至昨日法商電車及公共汽車、亦頗擁擠、各該公司均另撥車輛、加入行駛、</p>
<p>西報所載罷工經過</p>
<p>英文大美晚報云、上海電車公司職員開車賣票及苦力等共八百人、因經該公司倍開爾路工廠機械部銅匠間罷工工人所煽動、乃於昨日上午四時三十分、開始罷工、因此昨日街道上電車完全絕跡、嗣五時半左右、中國公共汽車公司康腦脫路分行機械部工人亦實行響應、開始</p>
<p>靜坐罷工</p>
<p>並煽動其他職員及工人參加、昨晨、電車公司某職員稱、罷工工人至今仍未提出要求、公共汽車工人亦採取同樣態度、昨晨警務當局增派警捕多名、　駐該兩公司辦事處、</p>
<p>以防不測</p>
<p>大美晚報記者曾向公共汽車公司秘書亞諾瓊　詢及罷工情形、承答謂毫無糾紛發生、一切如　、昨晨租界警務當局報吿、對於上項工潮、亦叙述同等情形但昨晨公共汽車仍</p>
<p>照常開駛</p>
<p>直至昨日下午十二時三十分、公共汽車當局、向工人表示願將彼等要求增加生活津貼之條件、加以考慮、故該項工潮乃得暫時解決、該公司交通經理鄭德拉調停此項工潮、並向工人答允、如當局接受工人所提出之條件、別準於星期一公佈、</p>
<h3>謝晋元電英美當局　呼籲伸張正義　工部局方面仍保持緘默　昨日一般情况尙稱穩定</h3>
<p>孤軍營自發生不幸糾紛以來、迄已多日、本埠華人方面、對於工部局所採不適當之措施、至為遺憾、昨日、工部局方面仍保持絨默態度、對於中外新聞記者之探詢、仍稱「尙無消息發表」、平明社記者曾以此事向工部局高級長官方面探詢、亦僅稱「工部局昨仍繼續進行調查」、惟悉孤軍營營房四週、現仍為萬國商團之白俄團丁所封鎖、</p>
<p>謝晋元電英美當局</p>
<p>謝團長昔元昨致英美當局電文一通、照錄如后、「英文太　晚報請轉美利堅羅斯福總統·倫敦邱吉爾首相閣下、並懇轉全世界人士公鑒、余等為一九三七年十月寢日上海我軍轉移陣地、奉令掩護撤退、固守四行倉庫之八百孤軍、旋因地處密邇租界、彈丸橫飛、中外人士、生命財產堪虞、由領事團授意英國防軍司令斯摩蘭脫少將等聯名籲請我最高統帥下令、突破封鎖、撤入租界者、三年來禁錮此間、吾人始終守秩序、無越軌之行動、且吾人一切費用、概由我政府按期撥付、工部局未負担分文、溯一九三八年八月八日眞日、懸旗慘案、以曾經工部局派代表談判、逢紀念日吾人得以升懸中華民國國旗、反受暴力摧殘、死士兵四名、傷百零七員名、超過余等固守四行三倍以上代價、本月元寒兩日、在層層戒備下、復搆築鐵絲網、致發生衝突、工部局利用水龍頭、液體毒氣、刺刀等之三年來殘酷高壓手段、當時受傷二十五員名、及巧日士兵向馬路行人說話、復受白俄團丁開槍射擊、當塲斃命重傷各一名、自寒日迄今、與外界交通完全斷絕、給養菜蔬、亦不得送入、市民激於義憤、由墻外投入物品、而受槓擊拘捕、電力亦以吾人有播音機收聽外界消息、斷絕供給、查國際公法對于俘虜待遇必合人道之規定、余敬謹向閣下呼籲、請為余等主持公道、伸張正義、以維國際法紀、世界文明、至盼至禱、中國四行孤軍團長謝晋元叩哿、」</p>
<p>昨日情勢尙稱平靜</p>
<p>英文大美晚報云、膠州路孤軍營今（廿日）晨情勢平靜、孤軍方面情緒、雖仍不安、然未聞續起紛擾、工部局發言人今晨聲稱、局勢尙無變化、局方僅將利用最和平之方法、以恢復孤軍營之秩序、刻正靜候孤軍領袖首先出以和解行動、非此局方不致開始進行討論或商榷、</p>
<p>死者暫厝傷者送院</p>
<p>此次孤軍營被守衛白俄商團濫施催涙彈、幷開槍射擊、除當塲死一人外、受傷者二十餘人、現聞死者已於昨日暫行安葬於孤軍營內、全營兵士、莫不為之大慟、至受槍傷之高光榮、右腿被中一彈、咋亦已車送仁濟醫院醫治、賈悅賢被刺腿部、陳德安·樊聖保·受催淚彈傷甚劇、亦車送北海路巡捕房醫院救治、此外受傷者二十餘人、均尙留營內、謝晋元團長、未允送往醫院、</p>
<p>讀者來函表示關切</p>
<p>昨有本報讀者楊惠來函云、編輯先生大鑒、敬啟者、自十四日膠州路孤軍營將士慘遭橫暴、繼之者叉有法租界我勇士慘被殘殺中心憤激、無以名狀、（中略）嗟乎、人之欺蔑、姑且不言、獨我輩曾被死力保衛之同胞、皆無動於中乎、雖曰、此租界也、權力操於他人、但論人口、我同胞佔百份之九九、在社會上工商各界、亦具相當地位、設能羣力以赴、亦可與地方當局折衝、今日孤軍將士所提出者、係撤消封鎖及恢復自由兩項要求、姑捨有關政治方面之恢復身體自由不計外、其撤銷封鎖以求生活行動自由一項、並不逾分、全市同胞、能勿予以援手乎、（中略）尙望先生曲將鄙意、代為宣達、聊慰赤忱是幸、專此、祇候撰安、僕楊惠謹上、九月十九日、</p>

<h3>騎巡隊定期解散　舉行吿別操演　廿三日下午在戈登路捕房檢閱　該隊成立迄今有七十五年之久</h3>
<p>公共租界警務處騎巡隊、前經工部局經濟委員會提議解散、並由董事會議決實行、茲多該騎巡隊已定於本月二十三日下午二時、在戈登路捕房舉行最後一次檢閱、同時將由該局總董凱自威、担任檢閱官、</p>
<p>舉行莊重　臨別操演</p>
<p>工部局警務處騎巡隊、定於二十三日午後二時、在戈登路捕房舉行簡單而莊重之典禮後、卽予解散、此項典禮、以臨別操演之形式出之、工部局總董凱自威與警務處長包文等將均與禮、先偕警務處各高級警官視察騎巡隊、然後檢閱該隊操演、警務處銅樂隊在塲奏樂、而警務處人員到塲觀體者當亦甚衆、</p>
<p>溯其往史　已甚久遠</p>
<p>查騎巡隊解散、乃工部局近所宣布多種拇節計劃之一、惟騎巡隊隊員廿六人、皆將併入警務處他科、騎巡隊之確切成立日期、已無從稽考、此猶其他許多警務紀錄然、史家雖力事考究、迄今未能斷定之、惟一般皆信騎巡隊創立於一八六五年、蓋是年工部局預算中、首次載有飼料一項也、</p>
<p>時代進步　失重要性</p>
<p>當初騎巡隊巡邏於靜安寺路、（時該路尙係界外馬路、）約二十年後、印捕隊成立騎巡隊人員亦增强、嗣後印捕隊續有增加、迄今已達五百二十四人、騎巡隊則因馬達自由車等機械仆運輸工具出現、而逐漸喪失其當初之價値、但仍維持騎巡二十六人之實力、照舊淮行其巡邏界外馬路之任務、以迄今日解散爲止、</p>
<p>擔任開道　隊容堂皇</p>
<p>若干年來、凡有盛大游行與軍隊開拔、皆由騎巡隊率先開道、隊容堂皇、故爲市民所熟知、騎巡隊二十六人中、計外籍及印度警官各二員、印捕二十二名、內大半曾服役於印度陸軍、該隊駿馬四十餘匹、多半係本市蓄主所贈、今騎巡隊旣吿解散、各馬乃歸還原主、其中不乏稱雄跑馬廳之名駒、</p>
<h3>外籍敎士間道抵浙　赴甬救難　携有大宗藥品</h3>

<h3>海達輪昨晨進口　載來大批洋米　計二萬六千餘包今日起卸　該輪曾在淞口被扣達五日</h3>
<p>茲悉近有華綸洋行海達輪、此次由西貢直接俄運大批洋米、計二萬六千餘包來滬、於木星期日（十五日）抵吳淞口、正擬進口時、忽見附近停泊之日艦懸旗、命停駛拋錨、海達輪船主瞥見、卽停車拋錨、斯時有小汽艇一艘、儎日軍多人、</p>
<p>登輪搜查</p>
<p>並加盤問、復命該輪駛往天津、船主當加拒絕、乃不准進口、臨去留駐日兵二名、該船主卽電滬行報吿、該行接電後、旋卽呈報挪威駐滬總領事館、請求交涉釋放、一方又以私人名義與日方疏通、至前晚</p>
<p>已允釋放</p>
<p>該輪遂於昨晨八時許、駛　浦江、十時許、至浦東鴻興碼頭停靠、洋米今日起卸、該倫在吳淞口外、計被扣五日、惟洋米一項、自滬防航述恢復後、水脚較前低廉、產價已趨下落、故本市各米業行號咸以該項洋米一俟成交、運滬應市、尙有</p>
<p>厚利可獲</p>
<p>爰已紛紛致電國外訂購、又據關係方面透露消息、國米來源將愈趨增加，並秋收已可預卜、約於農歷九月中旬、卽可次第登塲</p>

<h3>虐待動物</h3>
<p>— 翁華洛</p>
<p>報紙上有一個値得我們興奮的消息，大標題是『工部局解除禽畜痛苦』，內容說：</p>
<p>『工部局茲據上海保護甡畜會函，以虞洽卿路廣東路附近一帶，出售禽畜之商店，時有虐待禽畜情事，請予取締，以符人道。該局接函以後，當經飭由衛生處派員調查屬實，爰於昨日發出第五三一六號佈吿，略稱：「照得商販出售甡畜，包括家禽，獵獲物，鳥類，及田鷄等在內，均應以合乎人道之方法，待遇各該姓畜。販賣之人，務須設法預防，俾免受非必要之痛苦，倘有違犯本布吿之規定者，本局當依法起訴。」』工部局禁止市民虐待動物，已經不止一次了，祇是『言者諄諄，聽者藐藐』，成効似乎不大。我們希望，從心坎裏希望這次工部局會切實施行這個禁令，而全體市民也會一體切實遵行。</p>
<p>我們不但希望虐待動物的事件，不軍見於上海，我們更希望對於高等動物的虐待事件，也會就此絕跡！</p>
<h3>隨筆　一隻「落湯鷄」</h3>
<p>— 高揚</p>
<p>唉，眞叫天不「佑」人，早晨出去的時候，雖然老天死扳着臉孔，灰暗了一點，但東方還顯露着一絲絲的日光，而且風也不緊，想起來不會下雨的吧，因此，一切雨具都沒有帶。</p>
<p>其實，今天的情緒是特殊地興奮的，爲了想去看看我們的戰士。所以，卽使是下雨，也不會去顧慮到這些。</p>
<p>公園裏的空氣，不知道是我主觀的想像力豐富呢，還是眞的事實－連菌綠的草原上似乎也緊張了，這裹好像是在呼吸着戰鬥的空氣，但角落裏增加了武裝的人們，到底是眞的</p>
<p>隔着籬笆，裏面站着我們的英雄，雖然沒有好的地方站，但四面臨空的「梅花椿」倒成了「四平八穩」站崗處，他們屹然不動地站着。</p>
<p>下雨了，雨點像是專門找乾衣服來淋似的，站着的人們，給淋濕了。站在這邊的穿上了雨衣，可是「梅花樁」上的英雄，却仍是英武地屹立着不動分毫。物質條件是別人的好，但精神是我們的强，其實，這也是環境所鍜鍊成的。</p>
<p>有人在說『呀，他們今天將變成「落湯鷄了」，！』我不知道這是打趣，還是同情，不過我總覺得這種精神是偉大的，是了不起的。在我內心的深處，致以默默的敬意。</p>
<p>肚子餓，迫着回家了，但雨點却不肯疏一下，可是站在「梅花椿」上的英雄，却沒有調班吃飯，而儘讓水在身上掛着，我感到慚愧。</p>
<p>好吧，別人該吃苦，不怕雨，我難道跑不得的嗎？於是，鼓足勇氣，打下了決心，冒着大雨走回家。</p>
<p>經過公共汽車站，等的人很擠，賣票的却報以「叮可」兩聲，車子一直向前走了。車上很空，門却不開，淋在雨裏的人，還是繼續被淋着。車子過後，車站上起了一陣謾駡聲，賣票的却不管這些。</p>
<p>轉角上碰見了一個摩登女郞，是同事，看見了我，叫一聲『呵，一隻落湯鷄，」』我不回答，祗點點頭。</p>
<p>穿着高跟鞋，赤着脚，脚趾上是紅的，手裏撑着傘，在叫黃包車，嘴裏自言自語：『落雨討厭來！』</p>
<p>一瞬眼，載着摩登女郞的黃包車，跑在我前面，想起方才的情形，不禁使我肅然，我也替她們難過着！</p>
<p>到家，母親帶着慈祥的笑容迎上來，『衣服濕了，快換掉，要生病的，……爲啥勿乘車子？」</p>
<p>「勿要緊，姆媽，風一吹就會乾的！」</p>
<p>雜感</p>
<h3>偶感一章</h3>
<p>— 戈漠風</p>
<p>我厭惡所謂「倚老賣老」，何况前輩文人，往往却並無老可賣，印過一兩本「傑作集」，或因襲補苴地來一套「綱要」之類的「尊編」，或「哎呀——哎呀」地出了一册「××的詩」之後，居然歸身於學者，詩人或作家之列；從此便變成了公牛，再也擠不出一點乳汁來了。倘尙欲以此恃老，則居腐臭爲神奇，該也不免羞人答答」的吧？</p>
<p>然而浮誇的靑年作家」也者，其「倚少賣少」的程度，有時就更招人厭惡：抓起一面旗幟，塗了一些「大作」，便自以爲出人頭地；於是乎趾高氣揚，不思不學，目空一世。更卑劣的，就流爲「文棍」，以嗚鞭喝道爲　一業績，以海蔑和謾駡爲成名捷徑。在其驕橫恣肆的心目中：「前無古人，後無來者」，惟有自己，眞可慨嘆！</p>
<p>自溢，矜誇，在妄，對於一個文藝工作者，借用契訶夫的一句話來說；這些就都正是妨碍馬耕田的馬蠅！我看：還是虛心些，勤劬些的好，應該多加鍛鍊的，不是別人，也還是　責諸「自己」！</p>
<p>「我並不敢把自己看做一匹阿拉伯的駿馬，不過是一匹馭貨的馬而已，我的成就…………大部是賴於我工作的能力，我的愛好工作。」這是高爾基的謙虛瀝誠的自白。倘竟以爲不値得學習，則此種「靑年作家」，可以休矣！</p>
<p>霍桑探案</p>
<h3>舞后的歸宿</h3>
<p>— 程小靑著</p>
<p>第七章　「把他押起來」</p>
<p>他問我道：「此刻你身邊總帶着槍了罷？」</p>
<p>我應道：「是的，這是你樓上抽屜裹的那支小槍。你想那七十一號可會已瞧見了趙伯雄？」</p>
<p>「概如此。你身上還帶着現鈔嗎？五六十元就行。」</p>
<p>「有，是不是付給七十一號的酬報？」</p>
<p>「是的，我不曾多帶現鈔。這傢伙就爲着我的諾言而努力，當然要現開銷的，支票也許不相信。」</p>
<p>這時汽車的速率很快，幾乎耍超過規定的限度。我的神經也緊張到了相當的程度。</p>
<p>我也問道：「你想這趙伯雄可會就是兇手？」</p>
<p>霍桑答道：「那還難說。但據我們已知道的事實而論，這個人確是這一齣戲中的一個重要的主角。」</p>
<p>汽車駛到了亞東的側門前停住。霍桑又戴上那副墨晶眼鏡，粘上了假鬚，重新作一次臨時化裝。他走進了旅館的門，他的右手挿在藏靑嗶嘰的短掛袋裏，眼光便不時向左右流轉，採取一種嚴重的警戒狀態。我跟在後面，當然也小心翼翼。我們在電梯間門前站了一站。電梯降落時，放出來六七個人，我也曾仔細觀察，不見有什麽可疑人物。電梯一直升到七層樓，我們就走出來，一直到那甬道的西口，恰巧見那七十一號茶房走過來。霍桑忙一把拉任他生手臂。那阿根倒反而呆了一呆，顯然霍桑的化裝眞有些效果。霍桑拉着他到起先我們談話的轉折處，便低聲說話。</p>
<p>霍桑道：「阿根，我就是霍桑。你已瞧見了他嗎？」</p>
<p>那七十一號向霍桑端相了一下，才點頭應道：「是的，霍先生。他已改了裝。他本來是穿西裝的，我剛才見他，他穿着一件深藍的毛葛袍子，頭上戴一頂棕色呢帽——」</p>
<p>霍桑不等他說完，眼眼裏好像迸出火光。「嘴唇上是不是還有短鬚？還戴着眼鏡？」</p>
<p>「對，霍先生，你也瞧見他了嗎？」（一一三）</p>

<h3>關於薩克之死</h3>
<p>— 義毅</p>
<p>本市組織最完善之華聯，銀聯，保聯三大業餘劇團，將於本星期日（二十二日）上午十時，假座璇宮劇院舉行星期早塲聯合公演，票價分六角四角二種，劇目爲華聯「薩克之死」，銀聯「都會的一角」，保聯「一個螞蜂」，俱爲獨幕劇云。</p>
<p>當我提起筆來要寫這一篇不三不四的東西地時候，我有喜歡有憂慮，因爲近來我眞被這種矛盾底心理所苦惱着。我是一個什麼都不懂的孩子，戲劇當然也不會例外，導演更不必談及了，這一次竟然祖任「薩克之死」的導演者，我眞有點自已也不相信自己起來，實在有點兒莫知所措。好在該劇戲中底諸位演員們全是我的好同學與好朋友，所以我也就毅然的決定下來，大胆的來排練這一幕戲劇，可是到今日却有點兒禁不住的寒慄起來，一部良好的作品，會不會因而我而損壤？諸位好友的演戲大才，會不會爲我而障礙？我眞爲這二點担憂着！</p>
<p>關係「薩克之死一的故事，展開在舞台上，是講述西班牙內戰時，空軍司令薩克上校底矛盾心理。因爲他是處於愛親生的子女，也愛其偉大的祖國，所以其理智與情感沒有一刻不在互相慟突着，但是國家底法律又祇有一條，國家不能因爲他兒子的關係，來葬送它偉大的前程。最後薩克毅然的決定了一切，終於爲祖國而作一壯烈的殉國了。其子魯易，空軍上尉，是一個英俊有爲的靑年，雖然他父親死去不免給他有些傷感，可是他立卽用理智來尅服情感，很快的決定爲國効勞，決不步入他父親的覆轍。——老的是死了，新生的生命，新生的力量不斷底在長大起來！</p>
<p>整個劇本的展開，從開幕至閉慕爲止，沒有一分鐘不在熱情，緊張，刺激，壯烈中過去。也好給今日上海一般昏迷的同胞，作一當頭棒擊。總之「薩克之死」確是一幕好戲，値得我們排練和獻演給大家看。</p>
<h3>王門桃李補遺</h3>

<p>關於姜妙香王蕙芳以及四大名旦中之梅尙，是吾王門子弟一節，老顧曲者，皆知其事，王姜梅尙，雖稱德霖弟子，而亦未執贄受業，德霖眞正弟子，僅王琴儂一人耳。當時諸子以德霖齒長，羣以老夫子尊之，其情形正與王姜梅尊師事瑤卿相同，筆者昨翻閱南京戲曲音樂院北平分院硏究所出版之劇學日刊，第三卷第七期內，有「京劇生旦兩革命家二文，出自名家手筆，叙述譚鑫培與王瑤卿二人之藝事經歷，至周旦詳，洋洋數千言，堪稱不朽名作，文內對於王門桃李，附有古瑁軒子弟記（古瑁軒係瑤卿別號）殿其篇末，拙作前文表內所列各伶，全部羅列在內，且附短文，誌其略歷，茲將姜王梅尙四人之附言，襲誌於後，以作本文之結束。</p>
<p>姜妙香　瑤卿爲妙香說戲甚多，是時瑤卿祗二十餘歲，睡極早，每妙香來，瑤卿卽延人臥室，臥而敎之，及妙香改小生，不復演靑衣，瑤卿尙爲說「雁門關」「楊八郞」等劇。</p>
<p>王蕙芳　王蕙芳從瑤卿請益最多，雖未執贄受業，所謂有其實而無其名也，瑤卿盛時，蕙芳屢與同班。</p>
<p>梅蘭芳　蘭芳初以兄禮事瑤卿，其伯父雨田，曾命以瑤卿爲師法，或曰已行拜師禮，或曰未也，而蘭芳輒呼爲先生，有時亦呼大哥，愈莫能詳，至其戲中技藝，多得之王氏，新腔則瑤卿從子少卿所造居多，非盡瑤卿之力，全部西施，則多瑤卿排演。</p>

<h3>Japan Puts Forward New Demands; Vietnamese Governor-General Decoux Rejects Them; Japan Issues Ultimatum, Giving France Three Days to Respond; Negotiations Break Down, Situation in Vietnam Extremely Tense</h3>
<p>Hong Kong: According to well-informed sources, French-Japanese negotiations on Vietnam have broken down, and the situation is extremely serious. (20th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Hong Kong: According to well-informed sources here, negotiations between the French authorities and the Japanese inspection team in Hanoi have completely broken down, and the situation in Vietnam is very critical. It is reported that the breakdown of the negotiations was brought about because, after the two sides agreed to allow the Japanese army (reportedly 25,000 troops) to pass through Vietnam to the border of Yunnan Province, the Japanese army made further demands. Vietnamese Governor-General Decoux has rejected these subsequent demands. It is said that the content concerns various bases outside the scope of the Vichy agreement and is considered unnecessary for Japan's military operations against China. Japanese expatriates in Hanoi are reportedly preparing to evacuate to Haiphong, where a Japanese ship is waiting. (20th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing: Authoritative government sources here are paying close attention to reports from Hanoi that Major General Nishihara, the leader of the Japanese delegation, has delivered a second ultimatum to the French authorities. For the past two days, wireless communications between Chongqing and Kunming have been busy, as key officials in these two cities are exchanging views and information on steps to be taken in response to the situation in Vietnam. Most political circles believe that the rapid turn of events in Hanoi may occur within a few days, and they anticipate that France will adopt a stronger stance. (20th United Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>Hong Kong: According to authoritative sources, Japan has issued an ultimatum to Vietnam, giving them 72 hours to respond, with the deadline expiring at midnight on September 22nd. However, this information has not yet been confirmed by official channels. (20th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Hong Kong: Although there are as-yet-unverified reports from Guangzhou Bay that personnel from the Japanese consulate and the Japanese monitoring team have been ordered to withdraw from Hanoi today, it is now reported that negotiations between Vietnamese Governor-General Decoux and Japanese representative Nishihara have reached an agreement, allowing 25,000 Japanese soldiers and military supplies to land in Haiphong in order to pass through Vietnam to the Yunnan border. Japanese Consul-General in Hong Kong, Okazaki, stated that he has not received any information regarding departures. It is also reported that the French authorities have prepared special trains for the Japanese to use to transport them to Haiphong. A Japanese warship is currently waiting in Haiphong. (20th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Hong Kong: News from Guangxi states that if the Japanese military's landing in Vietnam is stalled, it will be greatly detrimental to their plans to attack Yunnan. According to news from Shuikouguan, no Japanese troops have entered Vietnam through the Guangxi-Vietnam border. Sources in Chinese military circles here report that the Chinese army in Yunnan and Guangxi is currently monitoring the Japanese forces at Zhennanguan and Longzhou. It is also said that the Japanese commander in Guangxi, in light of the increasing possibility of cooperation between Britain and the United States in the Far East, dares not rashly send troops into Vietnam. However, every day the Japanese army is stalled, British-American cooperation gets closer. Reports on the Japanese troop strength on the Vietnamese border vary, according to news reports from Hanoi, Vichy, and Tokyo. According to Chinese sources in Beihai, there are four Japanese divisions stationed in Qinzhou County, Hainan, and the Hunzhou Islands, totaling 100,000 troops. It is said that in the event of a conflict, these 100,000 troops would be transported by sea to Haiphong, while the Japanese forces at Zhennanguan would move west towards Tang Dang (transliteration). North of Guangzhou and the Dongjiang area have been quiet for the past two weeks due to the Japanese troops being moved to Guangxi, Hainan, and the Hunzhou Islands. The main battles in South China are currently taking place in Shangsi County, between Nanning, Longzhou. (20th International News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tokyo: Today, Foreign Ministry spokesman Suma told reporters that although negotiations between the Japanese and French authorities in Hanoi have not yet reached an understanding, they are progressing smoothly. When asked whether Japanese troops had landed anywhere in Vietnam, the spokesman solemnly replied that he could confidently say that Japanese troops had not landed in Vietnam, and that Japan did not need to send troops to land before reaching an understanding with the Vietnamese authorities. The spokesman also stated that reports in the foreign press of clashes between Chinese and French forces near the Vietnamese border have not been confirmed by official reports.

<p>Hanoi: Since the Japanese side presented a new ultimatum to the French authorities last night, Japanese expatriates and personnel from the Japanese military delegation have hurriedly evacuated Hanoi, causing the situation in Annam to be exceptionally tense today. According to French officials, the Japanese side presented the French last night with new demands that the Vichy government would find difficult to accept. Well-informed sources also revealed that the new demands made by the Japanese side were presented entirely in the form of an ultimatum, reportedly with a deadline of midnight this Saturday. (20th United Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>Hanoi: Much attention is being paid here to the movements of six French warships. These warships began this week to pass through the Strait of Gibraltar with British permission. Some believe that these warships are unlikely to arrive quickly enough to cope with the current tense situation, but their destination is undoubtedly Annam. Annam officials apparently decided last night to reject the Japanese ultimatum, and the French army stationed in Annam is also prepared to resist any invading Japanese. It is widely believed that if the French resolutely reject Japan's demands before the ultimatum deadline expires, Japan may launch a joint land and sea invasion of Annam. The Japanese army in Guangdong has already concentrated a large number of troops on the Annam border, and the Japanese navy is concentrated on the waters off Annam. Some are convinced that Japan's new demands, in addition to special economic interests, mainly concern permanent naval and air bases in Annam. As for Japan's previous request to pass through Annam, it was merely a smokescreen for the new demands mentioned above. (20th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Nishihara Issues Warning, Says Situation Will Worsen</h3>
<p>Hanoi: Major General Nishihara, the leader of the Japanese delegation, recently issued a warning, stating that the Japanese ultimatum will expire on Sunday evening. If French-Japanese negotiations completely break down, the situation will become even worse, and he is prepared to leave Haiphong for Tokyo. Nishihara said that the evacuation of Japanese nationals today does not mean that a real crisis has arrived. He also stated that he is prepared to leave Hanoi today. If the negotiations reach a point that "I consider hopeless, then I will return to Tokyo." What steps the Japanese will take if France rejects Japan's demands will be decided in Tokyo. There is now a time limit on the response to the demands. Nishihara also denied that the new demands were outside the scope of the Vichy-Tokyo agreement, stating that the Japanese delegation is acting strictly in accordance with the Vichy-Tokyo agreement. Nishihara accused France of adopting delaying tactics, saying that the Tokyo agreement was signed three weeks ago, but the French side has not yet fulfilled its obligations under the agreement. Nishihara also accused the French side of ignoring Japan's proposals. According to an official announcement here, French-Japanese negotiations are still underway, but France is unlikely to accept any demands that go beyond the scope of the Vichy-Tokyo agreement. The situation in Vietnam is currently quite critical, but also very chaotic, because Japan's new demands have not been announced. However, it is said that they are the same as the demands of September 2nd. Major General Nishihara, when asked by reporters about U.S. Secretary of State Hull's recent statement that the U.S. is very concerned about the current situation in Vietnam, replied that the current situation in Vietnam is not threatened and that the territorial integrity of Vietnam is not endangered. Nishihara also understands that the current relationship between France and Japan is similar to the current cooperation between Britain and the United States. Although Japanese expatriates are withdrawing from Hanoi to Haiphong, the Japanese still maintain a sense of self-restraint. This sense of self-restraint is reflected in the actions of the Japanese delegation personnel, who are paying hotel waiters and bartenders in Japanese yen, saying that Japanese currency cannot be used in Vietnam. Major General Nishihara met with American reporters at the heavily guarded headquarters of the Japanese delegation, which is located inside a government building. Nishihara stressed that the Japanese have very friendly feelings towards the French and that the Japanese have no intention of hating the French. 147 Japanese expatriates here, including some members of the delegation, sang the Japanese national anthem this morning and boarded special trains to Haiphong. When the Japanese gathered on the station platform and sang the Japanese national anthem, French and Annamese people stood and watched continuously. As for the other senior Japanese delegation officials, it is reported that they will travel to Haiphong by car this afternoon. (20th United Press Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japanese Expatriates Rush to Evacuate; Negotiations Enter Delicate Stage</h3>
<p>Hanoi: Negotiations between France and Japan over Japan's demands on Annam had almost reached the point of rupture as of last night. According to a French official report, after Japan put forward new demands that were "greatly at odds with the instructions of the Vichy government and completely deviated from the normal track of the French-Japanese agreement," the negotiations had suddenly turned into a "weak state." Although the French official report stated that negotiations were still continuing, Japan was apparently preparing for the breakdown of negotiations. Last night, 400 Japanese expatriates received orders to evacuate Annam urgently, at the latest by today. Most Japanese have already taken special trains from Hanoi to Haiphong this morning. 4.5 tons of luggage was transported to Haiphong last night. It is said that three Japanese warships are pre-stationed there, specifically for the evacuation of Japanese expatriates. It is reported that these ships were ordered to come and must wait for the evacuating Japanese expatriates to board before they can set sail after receiving orders. Personnel from the Japanese military delegation also announced that they were preparing to leave Hanoi, but delegation leader Nishihara would remain here for a few more days before leaving. Last night, Mr. Nishihara visited Vietnamese Governor-General Decoux and his wife. It is widely believed that this visit was really a "farewell" visit. (20th Taiwan Mass Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>Hanoi: Japanese consuls in various parts of Vietnam are preparing for their country's expatriates to board ships and evacuate. This measure is initially not based on concrete facts, but the Governor-General of Vietnam has provided various conveniences. It is now known that the Japanese delegation has put forward new demands, the nature of which seems to have exceeded the scope of the agreement in principle between France and Japan and is difficult to reconcile with the instructions received by the Vietnamese authorities. For this reason, it has entered a delicate stage. The two sides are currently continuing discussions. (20th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>Haiphong: According to French official sources, negotiations between France and Japan in Hanoi have reached a "delicate" stage. It is reported that the Japanese side has demanded the establishment of bases, a demand that is not within the scope of the Vichy Agreement and is unrelated to the war against China. All Japanese expatriates in Vietnam are now ostensibly gathered in one place, preparing to evacuate. A special train will depart from Hanoi to Haiphong today, specially carrying Japanese expatriates. However, the Japanese authorities have not yet issued an evacuation order. According to a Japanese army spokesman, negotiations are still underway and we remain optimistic about reaching a satisfactory conclusion. (20th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>French Foreign Minister Tells U.S. Will Allow Japanese Troops to Pass Through</h3>
<p>New York: French Foreign Minister Baudouin told U.S. reporters in Vichy yesterday that France would accept Japan's request to send troops through Vietnam. France cannot expect the assistance of Britain and the United States, so the Pétain government must adopt a realistic policy to protect French colonies. (20th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Vichy: Today, French Foreign Minister Baudouin, when meeting with representatives of the U.S. press, stated that France had recently accepted something unexpected and had to succumb to Japan's request to pass through Vietnam. Baudouin said that France could not hope for the assistance of Britain and the United States, and therefore had to follow a realistic policy to protect the country's security. "France is currently negotiating alone with the Japanese." Baudouin's remarks contradict rumors that Germany is directing the Vichy government on the Vietnam issue. Baudouin also said that the Japanese government made a request to pass through Vietnam as early as June 13th. This was the day that General Weygand requested an armistice from Germany and Italy. Lieutenant General Decoux, the Governor-General of Vietnam, was conducting negotiations with the Japanese side, but the Japanese side expressed dissatisfaction and made new demands on August 2nd. Baudouin said that although the French were under the threat of Japanese military occupation, they rejected negotiations on the new demands made by the Japanese side because the Japanese demands at that time were extremely unreasonable. He said, "We recognize that Japan is the strongest country in the Far East. We intend to follow a realistic policy to protect France's interests and unity. We have notified the U.S. government of the progress of the negotiations from the beginning. Vietnam still exists under the influence of the British government in the Far East, but we must act alone, because we cannot hope for more than diplomatic assistance from Britain and the United States. (20th International News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>Washington: Although newspapers in major cities on the East Coast have published special news reports stating that France has decided to allow Japanese troops to pass through Vietnam, Secretary of State Hull declared late yesterday that he had not yet received official confirmation of the matter. Hull added that the United States firmly opposes Japanese aggression against Vietnam. This policy of the United States is known to the world. As for the rumors that France has decided to allow Japanese troops to enter Vietnam, he is still waiting for official confirmation. Continued on page 4</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Origins and Destinations of Legal Tender</h3>
<p>Rumors have been circulating in the Shanghai market that a large amount of new banknotes has been shipped from the United States and Britain to Chongqing, leading to all sorts of misinformation. Speculators are gleefully spreading the word that this is evidence of inflation, a harbinger of rising prices, and a clear sign that the foundation of legal tender is weakening. Their aim is to stir up trouble and create opportunities for profit. However, this is extremely naive. If their claims were true, would the legal tender they deceitfully acquire still hold any value? If they are not naive, then there must be other motives behind their actions. However, in today's world, where everything is in ruins and economic activities are severely restricted, can they be sure of benefiting from their actions? This is something that even those with a little common sense can understand. It is important to recognize that legal tender is currently the only currency in China and the lifeline of the Chinese economy. Those who speak of inflation do not understand the vastness of China and its large population, nor do they understand the complex financial system of old China, the variety of currencies, and the centralization of silver dollars after the circulation of legal tender. Legal tender has its own inherent expansiveness. To simply grasp a superficial understanding and misuse terminology, claiming that the circulation of new banknotes equates to inflation and impacts prices, demonstrates a failure to understand the matter. This is akin to strumming a lute without understanding the keys. Their aim is to create chaos and sabotage through insidious plots.</p>
<p>During the process of currency unification, the increase in the issuance of legal tender is a necessary adjustment to factual needs, not comparable to situations where the currency system has long been unified, issuance has long been centralized, and the issuance of paper money suddenly expands to meet fiscal needs. Leaving aside the fact that the increase in the issuance of Chinese legal tender is an appropriate move, even if we concede that today's rising prices are a result of the increased issuance of legal tender, or that the increased issuance of legal tender is itself influenced by rising prices and the inadequacy of small denominations, it is not difficult to determine this by comparing the development rates of the two. When measured against prices, the rate of increase is often five to six times higher than before the war, but the increase in the issuance of legal tender has not been so huge or rapid. Furthermore, when compared to the large total population of China and the destruction of old currencies and banknotes, it is clear that legal tender alone is far from sufficient as a medium of exchange. Moreover, the Central Bank of China and the Farmers Bank of China are publicly handling the gradual recall of old banknotes. Therefore, exchanging old for new to facilitate transactions is also an inevitable path for issuing new banknotes. To not consider this and blindly focus on the increase in new banknotes, claiming it to be inflation, is unreasonable. Inflation, after all, is a comparative term. More now than before is inflation, less now than before is contraction. The degree of inflation and contraction each has its own measure. Only when it exceeds this naturally expected measure, whether it be more or less, can inflation and contraction be said to exist. As for the soaring prices of today, it is due to (1) the extensive destruction of agricultural and industrial enterprises in the occupied areas, leading to reduced production. Even when there is production, it is subject to extortion and outflow. (2) There are those who attack the foreign exchange market, causing the Chinese authorities to abandon their policy of maintaining it, allowing the black market to grow and fall on its own, ultimately leading to a shortage due to the failure to adjust supply and demand, hence the high prices. (3) Coastal transportation is often blockaded, disrupting freight transportation, and naturally causing price fluctuations. (4) Then there is the "control" in the occupied areas, clever extortion and plunder, so that the producers suffer huge losses, which they have to recoup through the prices of goods sold freely, so prices cannot but be high. These are the major factors. Moreover, due to the high prices, small denomination currencies are inconvenient for transactions and have to be replaced with higher denomination currencies. This can be seen in the recent trend of rising retail prices, the decreasing need for one-cent coins, and the gradual trend of using five cents as the retail unit. Therefore, the progression of paper money from one yuan to five yuan, ten yuan, and even fifty yuan or one hundred yuan, is necessary given the current situation. Moreover, the banknotes printed this time are intended to "alleviate the panic over the lack of banknotes in free China." If the "lack" is so great as to cause "panic," it is clear that there is an excess deficit. To "supplement" what is "insufficient" through the issuance of new banknotes is not comparable to inflation. Moreover, how could it flow into the occupied areas, making their inflammatory rhetoric even more misleading?</p>
<p>How could free China face a shortage of banknotes leading to panic? One can assume that it is due to the smooth implementation of legal tender, such as in Sichuan, Yunnan, Kang, and Tibet, where silver was previously used, but now legal tender is used, and the demand for legal tender has naturally increased. Secondly, private funds are fleeing abroad, which is undeniable in today's unstable situation. The result of this flight is bound to lead to a situation where the circulation of legal tender is abundant in some places and deficient in others. For example, Shanghai is a central point for fleeing funds from home and abroad, resulting in an oversupply of floating capital, rampant speculation, and promoting rising prices. Therefore, to ultimately prevent inflation, it is not difficult to do so by (1) moving banknotes from places with an excess of banknotes to places with a shortage of banknotes, leveling the playing field. (2) Lowering the interest rate on current deposits and raising the interest rate on fixed savings deposits, so that floating capital can be used for legitimate purposes through the hands of the financial sector. (3) Buying and selling new and old public bonds, which not only offer generous benefits but also have government guarantees, eliminating the risk of speculation. Indeed, today, the chances of failure for those who speculate in commodities are greater than the chances of success, unlike last year. (4) Form a syndicate or corporate investment group to undertake planned development projects in the interior, soliciting investment from all sectors, with the government guaranteeing interest. All of these measures will channel floating capital into legitimate uses, which is also a strategy to curb the loose and chaotic market and suppress speculation. In fact, a State Department official pointed out that the Secretary of State had issued three diplomatic warnings to Tokyo regarding disturbances to the territorial status quo in the Far East. No matter where Japan invades, it is contrary to the views of the United States. (20th International News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Tokyo Opens Imperial Conference; Content Kept Absolutely Secret</h3>
<p>Tokyo: Cabinet ministers and heads of the Navy and Army met in the Imperial Palace yesterday for an Imperial Conference, which lasted three hours. The Chief Cabinet Secretary then issued a communiqué, stating that important state affairs were discussed. Those in attendance included the Prime Minister, Minister of the Navy, Minister of the Army, Minister of Foreign Affairs, Minister of Finance, the Chiefs and Deputy Chiefs of Staff of the Army and Navy, and the Director of the Planning Board. (20th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tokyo: The Japanese government today maintained absolute secrecy regarding its attitude towards Vietnam and prohibited domestic newspapers from publishing any information regarding Japan's ultimatum to Vietnam. Japanese newspapers attached great importance to the news of the Imperial Conference, but currently no newspaper openly speculates on the details of the meeting. Government officials refused to confirm reports that Japan had sent an ultimatum to Vietnam. It is rumored that the sending of the ultimatum was the result of the Imperial Conference, which was attended by the Emperor himself. Other officials who attended the meeting included Prime Minister Konoe and the heads of the Navy and Army. For two weeks, Japanese newspapers have refrained from publishing details of the French-Japanese negotiations in Hanoi, so the Japanese people today are still unaware that the French-Japanese negotiations have broken down and that Japanese expatriates in Vietnam are beginning to evacuate. Most of the news about Vietnam published in Japanese newspapers is "educational" in nature, with the sole intention of giving the Japanese general public the impression that "Vietnam is very important to Japan."

<h3>Luxury Goods: Implementation of a Ban on Domestic Sales; Trade Commission to Purchase Separately; Method of Purchase Price Also Specified</h3>
<p>Chongqing: The Ministry of Finance, with regard to nine major categories of imported foreign goods, including luxury tobacco, alcohol, and food, as well as high-end paper cigarettes manufactured in Shanghai and Hong Kong, which are banned from domestic transport, will implement a sales ban starting October 1st.

It is also understood that: (1) For goods subject to the sales ban, if the owner declares they are for personal use, the inspection authorities may, after verification, open the original packaging as appropriate to ensure that they cannot be resold. During transit, only quantities that are scattered with opened packaging and verified by the inspection authorities for personal use are permitted, in order to meet the intent of the sales ban; (2) The purchase price of foreign goods subject to the sales ban will generally be based on the import price at the first port of entry, plus the applicable customs duties, as the basic figure for calculation; (3) The purchase price of Shanghai and Hong Kong-made cigarettes subject to the sales ban will generally be based on the registered price reported by the tobacco company to the Tax Bureau, plus the applicable consolidated tax, as the basic figure for calculation. In addition, transportation and other expenses will be appropriately added based on the quantity of each item delivered. The overall goal is to reduce opportunities for merchants to exploit loopholes in the ban, and for the government to bear a fair and reasonable purchase price. (20th dispatch)</p>

<h3>United States Closely Watching Developments in the Far East Situation; US, UK, and Australia Discuss Pacific Joint Defense; Use of Singapore Naval Base for Information Exchange</h3>
<p>Washington: Well-informed sources here expressed concern about the negotiations between U.S. Secretary of State Hull, British Ambassador to the U.S. Lord Lothian, and Australian Minister to the U.S. Casey, deeply worried that the situation in the Far East may undergo a decisive change due to the Japanese army's entry into Vietnam. According to sources in Hanoi, negotiations between Japan and the Vietnamese authorities are nearing completion. U.S. officials believe that the U.S. will draw conclusions from this development, but the State Department claims that there is no affiliation with Japan's attempt to reorganize the status quo in the Far East. It is generally expected that the U.S. and Australia are conducting negotiations, preparing for the U.S. team to protect Australia, or will simultaneously protect Singapore, at least temporarily. The withdrawal of the U.S. fleet from Hawaii to the Pacific coast appears to be a sign of easing tensions, but in reality, it is a strategy by the U.S. Navy to enhance the efficiency of the Pacific Fleet in preparation for developments in the situation.

<h3>Rear Admiral Yarnell Suggests US Should Adopt Offensive Policy</h3>
<p>New York: Former commander of the U.S. Far East Fleet, Rear Admiral Yarnell, strongly stated yesterday that the United States should adopt an offensive policy to protect its interests in Asia. Yarnell said, "Withdrawing from the Far East is an impossible policy for the United States." He further said that the U.S. government should immediately sign a joint agreement with Britain, the Netherlands, and France to jointly protect mutual interests in the East. The United States should also seek new bases in the Pacific and strengthen its Far East Fleet, "using Singapore as a fleet base, assisting China in every possible way, and stopping the transport of military raw materials to Japan." Yarnell made these three points in his powerful speech. Yarnell also condemned Japan for not destroying American commerce in China, not bombing American people and property, not violating American treaty rights, and not ignoring American protests.

<h3>US Secretary of War Strenuously Advocates Strengthening External Defense Lines</h3>
<p>Washington: Secretary of War Stimson declared yesterday while hosting reporters that the United States should immediately strengthen its external defense lines. He said that because the defense money has already been lost and the British navy has begun to be shaken again, the United States must strengthen its external defense lines. The so-called external defense lines are obtained from British bases, which are all for naval use, but can also be used for combined land and sea operations. Once the survey of the valley is completed, the defense procedure will begin immediately. As for the construction of the southern base to defend the Panama Canal, diplomatic efforts are already underway. If someone approaches the area and launches an attack, the army and navy should resist. Stimson indicated that the United States' military plans have no intention of starting a war. He said, "We are seeking to prevent war." It was also specially stipulated at yesterday's meeting that Stimson's reception meetings every Thursday would be permitted only to reporters.

<h3>German Air Force Continues Offensive Against England in Wind and Rain; London Air Raid Lasted Eleven Hours Last Night; German Aircraft Groups Invaded England Again Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>Dublin: Yesterday, German bombers, escorted by fighter planes, attacked London again, dropping several bombs, many of which were heavy. The bombing lasted almost all night, and the alert was only lifted shortly after 6:00 am this morning. Despite the wind and rain, enemy planes continued to fly blindly, randomly dropping bombs on the capital. Residential areas suffered the most damage again. Before dawn, enemy bombers dive-bombed northwest and east London. Central London also suffered heavy damage, but casualties were minimal. A German bomber was hit by anti-aircraft fire in southwest London and crashed, destroying a house. A hospital was almost affected. (20th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>London: German aircraft raided the entire city of London for eleven hours, lasting until 6:00 am this morning. This time, the Germans' brutal behavior towards London was unparalleled. German planes flew even lower than before, and explosive bombs and incendiary bombs fell like hail. Tall buildings in London, long-standing landmarks, large stores in the West End, and old markets all became victims. Entire streets in several residential areas were completely destroyed. However, the British continued to attack German-occupied ports across the Channel. (20th International dispatch)</p>
<p>London: Last night until this morning, German planes continuously dropped particularly heavy bombs indiscriminately over London, while also bombing other parts of England, including Lanarkshire, Essex, Surrey, Berkshire, Kent, the Midlands, and the Southwest. Although the number of casualties was not significant, the material losses were likely to be huge. Residential areas in central, northwest, and east London were severely damaged. This morning, a powerful German fleet of aircraft flew across the coast from the Belgian seaside towards London. After reaching English territory, the planes divided into three groups and invaded simultaneously. At the same time, British Spitfire fighters also appeared in the sky above the coast and intercepted them. Approximately two hundred German planes were eventually able to penetrate inland. An alert was issued in London just before the German planes arrived, but after a fierce interception by British Spitfire and Hurricane fighters, the German planes retreated in disarray, and the alert was quickly lifted. (20th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>London: Since the German side launched its sky offensive on September 7th, yesterday was the quietest day in London. However, as dusk fell, the German side launched the most extensive attack since the start of the war on England. Therefore, last night German bombers flew in batches over London and many other places. The German air force apparently began to implement the intimidation issued by German newspapers yesterday, which referred to the British planes bombing a mental asylum in Pesar and demanded retaliation. When London was attacked last night, the areas hit were quite wide. It was reported that a certain town in the southeast was also attacked, with five bombs causing considerable damage. Northwest England was also attacked, but the German planes flying to the northeast were not as frequent as in previous nights. Some German planes that attacked last night seemed to try to penetrate central London from the northwest along new routes. Anti-aircraft guns in the northwest fired fiercely. Before long, the enemy planes got closer, and anti-aircraft guns in central London also roared in unison. Enemy planes continued to fly to northwest London, and dozens of searchlights opened to search. Suddenly, the roar of British fighters was heard, and the searchlights immediately went out. The German planes immediately tried to evade, while the British planes increased their search and pursuit. At the beginning of this air raid, a bomb fell in a suburb of north London. London's anti-aircraft fire was as fierce as before. (20th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>London: A Reuters visitor stated that the lightning and thick black clouds in southeastern England caused the other side's large-scale aircraft to fail to move. The problem of how to exhaust Goering's large-scale plan was not solved, but only a small number of enemy aircraft came alone. Although the British aircraft attacked the enemy aircraft yesterday was quite difficult, they still achieved good results. Last night, the Department of Aviation issued a bulletin stating that there was no large-scale air combat report yesterday. Two enemy aircraft dropped bombs in several areas of eastern London, with slight losses in property and life. British aircraft intercepted the two enemy aircraft and shot down a total of one. It was heard that bombs also fell on coastal towns in Essex and Sussex and somewhere in western England, with minor injuries and deaths. British fighters intercepted most of the attacking enemy aircraft with bad vision and destroyed five enemy bombers. It is estimated that about three hundred and fifty enemy aircraft carried out "blind bombing" of London and other places in England on Wednesday night. (20th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<h3>German Aircraft Groups Invade London from the Northwest Suburbs and Drop Bombs</h3>
<p>London: The fleet of planes of Head of State Hitler continued to bomb London last night, although the weather at the time was quite bad. However, aircraft groups still dropped huge amounts of bombs in various places in the city. The sound of anti-aircraft guns and the roar of aircraft were heard in the sky above London. German aircraft seemed to have adopted a new route to invade London, as they came from the northwest suburbs this time. The German planes were flying very low and were resisted by anti-aircraft guns everywhere. When the German planes flew to the center of the city, searchlights became very active. It was said that the bombs dropped by the German planes in the northern suburbs did not cause much damage to the city. Shortly after midnight, all the city's searchlights were completely extinguished. British planes then rose to engage. It was said that British fighters were searching everywhere for German planes under the moonlight. Thousands of London residents, ignoring the notices issued by the Ministry of Shipping and the Department of Security, still gathered at various stations last night for several hours before the air raid alert was issued. Last night, several German planes hovered over the city again, dropping five heavy bombs. Houses, shops, and all buildings within a mile were destroyed. It was said that the Southeastern Baptist Church, the former service personnel club, and the fire station were all hit. Also, the industrial area in the northwest of the city was also destroyed. Three bombs landed on a small factory. A spokesman for the Department of Domestic Security reported to the press last night that the German air force's attacks on British oil pools had so far only damaged slightly more than two percent of the total oil reserves. News last night said that the London County Council had also recently been bombed by German aircraft. As of 6:00 pm last night, London had only issued one alert yesterday. As for the bombing situation in the West End, a small bomb fell in the front yard of the British Museum. There were three large bomb holes on the street near the Japanese Embassy. The roof of the Beagaterly Hotel on Regent Street was also hit and collapsed. The secretary of the British Museum told the United Press, "We have suffered a slight glorious wound, but the losses are very small. The essence of the museum's antiquities has long been transported to a safe place." (20th United Press dispatch)</p>
<p>Stockholm: According to the latest news from London received here, when the German bombers and fighters attacked London last night, they were flying very low. After breaking through the anti-aircraft fire network on the outskirts of London, the German planes encountered British planes in the northwest district, but the German planes still reached the important targets of bombing in the southwest and northwest districts. The bombing was not over at 3:00 am this morning. The British Ministry of the Interior and the White Hall were partly destroyed, as was the Munson Building in the city center.

<h3>British Naval and Air Forces Attack Italian Military Base in Libya; Considerable Damage to the Italian Fleet in Benghazi; Difficulties with Supplies for Italian Forces Advancing East</h3>
<p>Cairo: According to news obtained here today, the British naval and air forces cooperated to attack the Italian military from both sides of the Mediterranean Sea. Italian military raids on the coast of northern Egypt and Italian strongholds in the Dodecanese Islands were all hit. The British Navy apparently suddenly concentrated its forces to make a surprising attack and attacked the Italian military with unprecedented momentum. According to reports, there were many large fires on the Dodecanese Islands, and thick smoke billowed into the sky, which could be seen from ships dozens of miles away. At the same time, the British military headquarters here denied the claim that the Egyptian Italian army had passed Maisa Matru. Today, it was also reported here that the British fleet stationed in Alexandria suddenly sailed towards the Egyptian coast at night, flanking the Italian transportation route from Libya. The British ships came so fast that the Italian military was caught off guard, and their coastal artillery had no chance to fight back. Reconnaissance planes worked hard in the dark to indicate targets, and the British Navy bombarded the Italian supply line from Libya to Egypt with artillery. It was heard that the British army in Egypt was greatly encouraged by the help of the navy. (20th International Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>Cairo: A public notice was released here last night stating that on the 18th of this month, British aircraft attacked the Italian base in the Dodecanese Islands with great success. The Mali area of Rhodes Island was bombed and caught fire, and Calato also had a large fire after several explosions. Porto Lago Bay on Leros Island was attacked, with hangars, barracks, and piers being hit. The oil storage also caught fire. Flames spread along the coast. All British aircraft returned safely. British aircraft continued to attack enemy forces in the western desert. One aircraft was hit and burned in Duna. Tobruk, an important Italian naval base in Libya, was attacked, and buildings were hit. An enemy motorcycle transport team between Sidi Barrani and Solon was bombed and burned. The El Tmimi airfield in Libya was bombed by British aircraft. About fifty enemy aircraft in the field were heavily damaged. Other camps in Pumba, Bardia, and between Gazala and Solon were also bombed. One British aircraft went missing. Also, on the 17th of this month, the South African British Air Force made its sixth raid on the Mogadishu airfield in Italian Somaliland, and all the bombs hit hangars and houses, with fires breaking out in many places. Chawiro in Abyssinia was attacked, and houses and hangars were severely damaged. One enemy bomber was also destroyed. When British bombers attacked Gasara three times, an enemy fighter plane tried to intercept but was destroyed instead. Asmara and Diralenwa in Eritrea were bombed again, with severe fires. (20th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>London: A Reuters military visitor stated that the news of the British Air Force's attack on the Italian naval base of Benghazi in Libya shows that the Italian military and supplies going to reinforce it may have been severely deterred. Benghazi Port is located 350 miles east of Tripoli and is advantageous for supplying food and water. The Italian side uses it as an outpost base. However, the Italian military transportation line in North Africa is lengthening, and the supply problem is becoming more difficult. Moreover, the left side of the Italian army along the coast has repeatedly been severely bombarded by the British Navy's fierce artillery fire, causing considerable damage. The Italian military relies on assembling large teams for rapid action, but it has not yet reached the British side's first real defense line, and the British military it has encountered is only a highly mobile force using guerrilla tactics in the desert. The Italian base in Benghazi is about 360 miles away from the vanguard of the Italian army. If the British Air Force continues to harass the Italian military's difficult-to-maintain transportation line, and the British Navy also increases its attacks, the mission of the British Army will be greatly reduced.

<h3>British Bomber Squadrons Bomb Ports at Night; Heaviest Bombing on Le Havre</h3>
<p>London – An official announcement stated that on Wednesday night, British bomber squadrons attacked the ports of Antwerp, Zeebrugge, Dunkirk, Ostend, Calais, Boulogne, Dieppe, and Le Havre, continuing to strike at enemy invasion plans. Enemy ships and military targets suffered heavy damage, with fires breaking out in multiple locations. Additionally, British bombers attacked enemy supply distribution centers such as Bessèges. Aircraft based on the British coast also attacked a convoy off Bergen, with one bomb hitting an enemy destroyer. Coastal aircraft attacked Cherbourg and ships off the Dutch coast, as well as the Texel airfield. Seven British aircraft are missing (Reuters, 20th).</p>
<p>London – An Air Ministry communiqué detailed the relentless attacks by British aircraft on enemy-held Channel ports, stating that the heaviest bombing on Wednesday night was on Le Havre. Large British heavy bomber squadrons, divided into multiple groups, braved fierce ground defenses to continuously attack the port's docks and ships for approximately five hours. They dropped multiple tons of high-explosive bombs and a large number of incendiary bombs. One bomb hit a dock, causing two terrifying explosions, apparently from a ship near the basin or a large warehouse by the pier. Flames quickly soared. British bombers, flying fifty miles away from the area, could still see the fire blazing when they looked back. A later British aircraft was attacked by heavy anti-aircraft fire from the port, so intense that the British aircrew could not distinguish between the sound of the exploding bombs. The British aircraft attacked at an altitude of less than a thousand feet, passing through a fire net, and was hit by three "pom-pom" shells, damaging gears, rubber tires, and piercing the fuselage. However, the crew was unharmed, and the aircraft safely returned to its base. Other British aircraft arrived in groups, fiercely bombing docks and ships until dawn. Large fires burned fiercely in various parts of the bombed area. The communiqué also described the fierce attacks by British aircraft on French, Dutch, and Belgian ports. During the attack on Ostend, a British aircraft at an altitude of one thousand five hundred feet dropped a massive bomb. The force of the explosion was so intense that the British aircraft was shaken and turned upside down (Reuters, 20th).</p>

<h3>Germany and Italy Agree on Plans for a New European Order; Italian Prime Minister and German Foreign Minister Meet Twice</h3>
<p>Rome – Reliable sources here state that the Axis powers of Germany and Italy are preparing plans for a new European order, to be implemented based on the situation after Italy occupies Egypt and Germany occupies England. These plans began to be drafted yesterday during a meeting between Italian Prime Minister Mussolini and German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop. The issues included in this new European order, such as Albania's demands on Greece and Yugoslavia, Spain's demands on Gibraltar, etc., are very far-reaching. Therefore, Mussolini and Hitler will need to confer again in the near future. Ribbentrop met with the Italian dictator for two hours yesterday. It is said that their conversation was quite "sincere," and Italian officials expressed satisfaction with the meeting last night, believing that future talks between Hitler and Mussolini will be smooth. However, Italian officials only described the meeting between Ribbentrop and Ciano as "very important" and refused to reveal any details. Officials also deny reports that the Axis powers have made new proposals to Britain. Regarding this point, a responsible Italian government spokesman told a United Press reporter, "We will fight to the last drop of blood if necessary. There are no peace proposals now, only the surrender of the enemy." Authoritative sources also state that Mussolini and Ribbentrop discussed redrawing countless new boundaries on the map of Europe during their meeting. Mussolini's mouthpiece, Gayda, recently wrote in the newspapers that the meeting also discussed the issues of Greece, Yugoslavia, and Turkey. Most Italian newspapers indicate that Albania's demands on Greece have not been abandoned, and Germany and Italy are very dissatisfied with Greece's pro-British stance. At the same time, well-informed sources believe that the Spanish issue also occupied an important position in yesterday's meeting between Mussolini and the German Foreign Minister. Observers point out that the Spanish Ambassador to Italy went to the station to welcome the German Foreign Minister upon his arrival in Italy yesterday, an action unprecedented by previous Spanish envoys. This situation is another sign of Spain's approach to the Axis powers. The Jianghuai Daily recently stated that the meeting between the Italian Prime Minister and the German Foreign Minister was held while Spain expressed its continued solidarity with the Axis powers (Haitong Telegraph, 20th).</p>
<p>Rome – It was announced here today that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini will meet again with German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop at 5 PM today (Haitong News Agency, 20th).</p>
<p>Rome – An international intelligence conference here today read out a statement explaining the views of Roman political circles on the meeting between the German Foreign Minister and the Italian leader, stating that the Rome meeting was an important event for close cooperation between the Axis powers, expressing the friendship and sincerity between the two leaders and foreign ministers. Yesterday's declaration did not mention any of the issues discussed in the meeting. This is the policy of the Axis powers, and it is not appropriate to announce during wartime. What can be announced is that the opinions of all parties on the various issues in this meeting, such as future strategies, are completely consistent. The content discussed regarding the Danube and Spanish issues cannot be announced (Haitong News Agency, 20th).</p>
<h3>Situation of Italian Troops Fighting in North Africa; Italian Army Commander-in-Chief Reports to the Italian Prime Minister</h3>
<p>Rome – Yesterday, newspapers here published a letter from General Graziani to Mussolini, describing the fighting situation of the Italian army on the Egyptian-Libyan border. It stated that the original strategy of the Italian army was to attack the British right wing, but due to enemy reinforcements, a lightning attack was launched on the left wing. As a result, the British armored vehicle column's rear was cut off. The Italian army's line of defense is as follows: the first line consists of several Libyan divisions, with the 20th Army Corps and artillery in the rear. The left wing consists of two mechanized army corps, and the right wing consists of a Blackshirt division as a reserve force. The combat plan is divided into two aspects: one is to advance to the point where the attack began, and the other is to attack the gates of Sollum and Halfaya, and then advance rapidly to Bardia. Difficulties were encountered in the second phase in Malerki, so the army quickly advanced north with the 10th Army Corps. On September 13th, the Italian army unexpectedly attacked Sollum and Halfaya, and by the evening of the 14th, they arrived at Teitan and Qaha, 25 kilometers from Sollum. On the 16th, Bardia was occupied, and a large number of British war materials were captured. According to various evidence, the British army's internal arrangements were improper, lacking drinking water and gasoline, and the headquarters were chaotic and at a loss. General Graziani highly praised the Italian army's bravery and endurance, as well as the Italian Air Force's attacks on the enemy and its protective work. British military experts predicted that the maximum number of Italian troops advancing along the coast would be 15,000, along with a small number of vehicles. In fact, the Italian mechanized units that passed through the area numbered 2,000 vehicles (Haitong Telegraph, 20th).</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Intensifies Fortifications on Romanian Border</h3>
<p>Bucharest, Romania – News has recently been received from various locations along the border between this country and the Soviet Union, particularly from Galați and Iași, that the Soviet authorities are building fortifications and constructing multiple airfields in the border area (Havas News Agency, 19th).</p>
<p>Bucharest – Romanian authorities issued an official gazette last night accusing the Hungarian troops occupying Outer Transylvania of arbitrary killings and arson. The official gazette cited 13 specific cases, detailing the events, proving that ten Romanians were killed by Hungarian troops, and several buildings in Outer Transylvanian villages were set on fire by Hungarian troops. One teacher and one pastor were burned to death (Haitong News Agency, 20th).</p>
<h3>New Caledonia Island Severs Ties with Vichy Government; Support for Free France Grows</h3>
<p>Melbourne – The Australian Federal Government has received notification that the French New Caledonia Island in Oceania has severed ties with the Vichy government and announced its allegiance to General de Gaulle, leader of the Free French forces in England. De Gaulle has appointed Sautot as Governor of New Caledonia Island, replacing General Denis, appointed by the Vichy government, who has now resigned. Australian Prime Minister Menzies stated that New Caledonia Island's allegiance to General de Gaulle further strengthens the connection between the island and Australia. The welfare of New Caledonia Island is related to Australia's genuine material interests, but this relationship is not an expression of hostility towards anyone else. This new development will not hinder the commercial agreements between Australia and the mining industry of New Caledonia Island (Reuters, 20th).</p>
<p>Hong Kong – The "Cross of Lorraine" badge worn by Free French supporters of General de Gaulle is now also seen in Hong Kong. A French architect has set up an office, and several French citizens have already registered there, volunteering to join the Free French Army currently being formed in England, and will depart as soon as possible. Those in charge may establish a committee to raise funds to cover their expenses to England (Reuters, 20th).</p>
<h3>Romanian Prime Minister Changes Title to Leader</h3>
<p>Bucharest – Romanian Prime Minister Antonescu will henceforth be called "Leader." The Foreign Ministry has notified foreign diplomats stationed in Romania that they should also use this title in diplomatic correspondence. This matter was passed by the Legionary Movement, which has now recognized Antonescu as a member of the Legionary Movement (Haitong News Agency, 20th).</p>
<h3>Random Notes on the European War (Part 1): Compiègne – Tragedy in the Forest</h3>
<p>This old-fashioned 2419D dining car was originally designed and built by Fleming, an American from California, and was stored in a museum seventy-five yards away. A week before the signing, German engineers, following Hitler's orders, moved it to the designated historically significant location. Journalists at the scene saw Hitler through the dust-covered windows, sitting in the chair once occupied by Foch, in front of his statue. To his left and right were Göring and Keitel; Brauchitsch and Hess sat on one side; Raeder and Ribbentrop sat on the other. Four empty seats were left at the opposite end.</p>
<p>At 3:30 PM, the four French representatives arrived by car and disembarked in front of the Alsace-Lorraine Memorial. They were General Huntziger, wearing a khaki uniform; Air Force General Bergeret; Navy Vice-Admiral Le Luc, all in dark blue uniforms; and former Polish Ambassador Noël, wearing civilian army attire. The representatives glanced at the war victory memorial covered by the swastika flag as they walked forward, accompanied by three German officers. The German guards saluted the French representatives.</p>
<p>After the French representatives boarded the car, the German leaders stood up in solemn respect. Hitler greeted the French representatives with a Nazi salute. Göring and Raeder saluted with their batons. Brauchitsch and Keitel saluted militarily, while Hess and Ribbentrop raised their arms in the Nazi salute. The French representatives returned the military salute. Hitler then sat down, nodding to General Keitel, who, in a calm tone, read aloud the preamble to the armistice terms proposed by Hitler in German, roughly stating: "On November 11, 1918, in this train car, the era of suffering for the German people began... On September 3, 1939,... England and France, without any reason, declared war on Germany again. Now, due to the judgment of firepower, Germany has been invited to propose ceasefire terms. If the historically significant Compiègne Forest is chosen as the site for receiving and delivering these terms, this is also a once and for all, appropriate matter. From this act of bovine retribution, it is good to wipe out a kind of memory that is not honorable in France and deeply ashamed of by the German side. After several bloody battles and heroic resistance, France has disintegrated. Germany does not want to impose conditions of an abusive nature on a brave enemy."</p>
<p>At 3:42 PM, Hitler stood up as a courtesy and then got out of the car. Except for General Keitel, the German leaders followed him and left. They walked past the guards as the music played loudly. Shortly after, they boarded the car and drove back to glorious Germany under the leafy branches of the Compiègne Forest. Here, in the 2419D dining car, Keitel stood in front of the green baize table, reading out the terms of the armistice one by one to the four French representatives. The negotiations were generally conducted in German. The French representatives were very proficient in German; the chief representative, General Huntziger, was originally from Alsace.</p>
<p>At 4:26 PM, the sun shone on the back of the forest, and some shadows were already dark in the open space. The French representatives then walked down the dining car and retreated into a small tent at the edge of the field. Inside were four wooden chairs, a table, and a washbasin. A bunch of roses was also placed on the table. Each seat had a document folder, and a calendar was marking this memorable date of June 21st. Telephone and telegraph lines could directly connect to Bordeaux, where General Pétain and his cabinet were eagerly waiting to hear this news. The draft of the conditions given to the French side by General Keitel consisted of thirty pages of paper, entirely in French. While the French representatives retreated into the tent to discuss, he took the time to get out of the car and stroll in the forest.</p>
<p>That evening, the French representatives drove fifty-two miles southwest of Paris, through the deserted streets under a curfew that began at nine o'clock, and stayed overnight in a hotel. The next morning, they returned to the small tent in the forest clearing. General Keitel allowed them to use the dining car, adding five secretaries inside. The French representatives carefully studied each clause. Almost every clause had to be discussed in detail with Bordeaux; every clause had to obtain the consent of General Keitel, who was outwardly polite but very firm in attitude. The next afternoon, Keitel sent someone to tell the French representatives that time was running short. The French chief representative, General Huntziger, replied that the French side was ready. Then, the French and German sides negotiated everything again at the green baize table.</p>
<p>General Huntziger said to the German representatives: "The French delegation believes that there is one more thing that needs to be stated. After being defeated in battle, France gave up armed resistance, hoping to use the spirit of this consultation to allow the two countries to obtain opportunities for common survival and mutual cooperation in the future. As a soldier, you should know how painful this time is for me." General Keitel replied: "I accept your words... I can only answer that the glory given by the victor to the vanquished is worthy of respect."</p>
<p>After the representatives of both sides spoke a few words, French Navy Vice-Admiral Le Luc wiped the tears from his cheeks. Amidst the rustling of pen tips, a French sentence was heard: "General, please give me the pen." The sound of the second signature began again. At this time, it was exactly 6:50 PM German summer time.</p>
<p>The four French representatives, having signed in the Compiègne Forest, were mentally exhausted and drove to Munich, where Hitler and Mussolini had already finalized their joint armistice treaty. After a good night's sleep, German military planes transported the French delegation to Rome to hear the Italian terms. In the 17th-century Villa Incisa, twelve miles from the outskirts of Rome, the French delegation met with Italian Foreign Minister Ciano, Chief of Staff General Badoglio, Admiral Cavagnari, and General Pricolo. Although France had no way not to accept the terms proposed by the Italian side, the French delegation spent twenty-four hours consulting with Bordeaux. Until 7:15 PM Italian summer time, two days after the signing of the Franco-German armistice, French General Huntziger and Italian General Badoglio signed the second armistice treaty.</p>
<p>At 1:35 AM German-Italian summer time on June 25, 1940, the war in France completely ended. Hitler announced to the people: "Thanks to God's blessing, flags should be hung in Germany for ten days and bells should be rung for seven days." France stipulated this day as a day of national humiliation. The Bordeaux newspapers said that France was not only defeated in battle, but all organizations and systems were also greatly damaged. The mistakes and sins of the past one or two decades have come to an end.</p>

Other exchange rates also followed suit, tightening slightly. The unofficial markets for British and US dollars suddenly turned tight and stable, due to continued demand for settling rice bills from abroad, and the afternoon rumors of various positive developments in Vietnam, stimulating speculators to aggressively purchase US dollars amounting to over 300,000, but fortunately foreign banks were willing to supply US dollars at $5.25 as much as possible, resulting in the British pound only tightening by 0.015625, and the US dollar only tightening by 0.03125, with the September futures almost aligned with the spot price, differing only in whether they were easy or difficult to settle.</p>

Transactions included Chinese banks, Shanghai East Asia Bank, and foreign banks such as Oliver &amp; Co. and the Belgian Bank buying September futures at $5.25 and October futures at $5.25 and $5.21875. Fortunately, foreign banks were still willing to supply and export tea merchants slightly released currencies, stopping the tightening trend and making it flat.

<h3>Sudden Good News Revives the Gold Market After a Fall</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cash "boiled red" (烚赤 - slang for spot market) black market situation initially showed a weak trend. Unexpectedly, before the evening close, it suddenly rebounded strongly. First, cash brokers and securities firms frequently exerted pressure, and around noon, this triggered a tendency among general floating traders to sell. The lowest price of the day reached 6,195 yuan. The afternoon opening was quiet, but around 3 p.m., news suddenly spread that the Japanese side had presented an ultimatum to Vietnam, demanding a reply within 72 hours, along with various mixed and favorable news. The foreign exchange market showed a slight tightening again, leading to considerable buying activity, pushing the price to a high of 6,290 yuan at one point. However, the result was that many profits were taken, causing the evening close to fall back to 6,265 yuan, an increase of 47 yuan compared to the previous day's settlement. The total trading volume was approximately 4,000 taels. Gold jewelry prices in silver shops remained unchanged. Customs gold and other types of gold remained stable.</p>
<p>Boiled Red Rises by 47 Yuan</p>
<p>The morning market was calm at the start. Silver brokers initially offered 10 taels of gold at 6,215 yuan, a slight decrease of 3 yuan compared to the previous closing price. Subsequently, due to still many sellers, the price continued to drop by 5 yuan, falling to 6,210 yuan. Then, a slight tightening of the foreign exchange market stimulated buying activity, with money exchange businesses and silver brokers competing to buy, gradually pushing the price up to 6,240 yuan. However, after that, the tightening of the foreign exchange market stopped and tended to stabilize. Gold brokers frequently sold, and soon securities firms followed suit, selling short. The market trend frequently turned downwards, and by 11:30 a.m., it had plummeted to the 6,200 yuan level, reaching a low price of 6,195 yuan. Later, the number of sellers decreased, and with the support of money exchange businesses, it recovered to 6,210 yuan. Finally, due to the excessive interest rates charged on margin accounts, there was renewed selling, so the noon close was only 6,200 yuan. At the afternoon opening, gold brokers initially offered 10 taels of gold at 6,210 yuan. Later, it briefly fell by 5 yuan, but soon a certain gold broker suddenly started buying aggressively. At that time, silver brokers intervened to sell, so the upward trend was slow. Before long, it rose to 6,220 yuan, and then slightly reached 6,215 yuan. Unexpectedly, after that, the buying activity suddenly expanded due to reports of various favorable news from Vietnam and a tightening foreign exchange market, which excited the people. Gold brokers and money exchange businesses bought aggressively, and silver brokers also turned around and started buying, at one point reaching as high as 6,290 yuan. After 3:15 p.m., the buying activity gradually dissipated, and the foreign exchange market had slightly stabilized, immediately triggering profit-taking. A certain gold broker also closed out positions from it, so before the close, it fell back to 6,258 yuan. However, as the people's confidence remained strong, the evening close was still 6,265 yuan, an increase of 47 yuan compared to the settlement of the previous day, with a fluctuation range of 95 yuan throughout the day. The selling price of the original funds of cash brokers was about ten yuan higher than "boiled red", and the buying price was 30 yuan lower. The current marked gold price is over 50 yuan lower than the listed gold price, and there is little activity in both.</p>
<p>Gold Jewelry Prices Still Unchanged</p>
<p>The selling price of gold jewelry in silver shops remained unchanged throughout the day. Da Tong Heng still hung a price of 640 yuan per tael. The price in Xin Tong Heng was the same as the above, with the buying price reduced by about 30 yuan.</p>
<h3>Foreign Currency Strengthens in the Evening</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market, the "boiled red" market price, initially fluctuated slightly lower. In the afternoon, there were sudden rumors of favorable news, causing the market price to rise frequently. English and American gold pounds also fell first and then rebounded, ultimately rising by one yuan each. There was still no shortage of demand for English gold notes, and the market price continued to rise by half a jiao (角 - a unit of currency). The price of American gold notes initially fell to 18 yuan, 7 jiao, and 3 fen (分 - a smaller unit of currency). In the afternoon, rumors of favorable news stirred up, and the evening market rose to 18 yuan and 8 jiao and a half, an increase of 7 fen compared to the previous day's close. The price of Hong Kong notes followed the Hong Kong-Shanghai exchange rate and rose another 3 fen. The price of Singapore notes rose by one jiao. The prices of Japanese gold notes and Korean notes continued to rise steadily, with the former reaching as high as 1 yuan, 5 jiao, and 1 fen, and the latter reaching as high as 1 yuan, 1 jiao, and 8 fen.</p>
<h3>Hankou Shanghai Exchange Rate Continues to Fall</h3>
<p>According to Hankou news, due to supply and demand relationships, the Shanghai exchange rate has continued to fall, with each thousand yuan increasing the premium by two yuan, i.e., Hankou paying 998 yuan in legal tender for 1,000 yuan in Shanghai legal tender. Each yuan of Japanese currency is worth 1 yuan, 3 jiao, and 4 fen in legal tender. The buying price of gold is 605 yuan per tael, and the selling price is 645 yuan. Previously, the exchange rate from Hankou to Shanghai was 50 yuan per thousand yuan.</p>
<h3>Grains: New Rice Gains Popularity, Another 30,000 Bags of Foreign Rice Arrive</h3>
<p>The black market price of foreign rice has recently become sluggish because 2,000-3,000 bags of national rice are successively transported from the suburbs of Shanghai to the city daily, which are directly received and sold by rice stores. Only so-called "bouncing ball" businesses make occasional forays, creating invisible rises and falls. These "bouncing ball" businesses have seemed calmer recently, but because of the price of production, sellers remain firm, and the market has risen by five or six jiao. After the rise, many floating traders flock out to sell, actual sales stop completely, and cargo owners do not take manipulative advantage, so the market falls in line with sentiment by small steps of six or seven jiao by noon. The result is that most deals are similar to before, and a minority are only one or two jiao less. Saigon first-grade and coarse-milled both sell for 17 yuan. Siamese first-grade sells for 66 yuan, second-grade for 61.5 yuan, coarse-milled for 61.8 yuan, Saigon second-grade for 62.5 yuan, broken rice for 53 yuan, and ground rice for 56.7 yuan. Jardine Matheson and Cie. and China Merchants Steam Navigation Co. Saigon Siamese are both marked at around 73 yuan, and there have been transactions. Only 3,000 bags of national rice have been traded.</p>
<p>Foreign rice has continued to arrive in recent days. It was reported in previous newspapers that the Jardine Matheson and Cie.'s Ding Sheng and China Merchants Steam Navigation Co.'s Taiyuan had transported foreign rice from Hong Kong. Yesterday afternoon, China Merchants Steam Navigation Co.'s Shandong arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong, also transporting 4,288 bags of foreign rice, berthing at the China Merchants Steam Navigation Co. wharf in the French Concession to unload. China Travel Service Shipping Company's Haida, which had directly loaded over 26,000 bags of foreign rice from the West, was hindered from entering the harbor when it reached the Wusongkou on Sunday (the 15th), and it was not allowed to enter the port for five days. It only entered the port yesterday morning, and is now unloading along the Pudong Hong Yu wharf.</p>
<p>No glutinous rice has arrived, so the market relies on existing stocks. But sales continue to be non-existent, and the market has fallen by four or five jiao. Opening Jinli special-grade sells for 68-69.5 yuan, Changdan white-grade sells for 67.5-68 yuan, Hong Kong special-grade sells for 68.5-69 yuan, and ordinary sells for 65-66 yuan.</p>
<p>The black market prices for national rice like thick/thin and broken early japonica are weak and stable. The opened prices are: Changbang special japonica 79 yuan, ordinary 75-76 yuan, Wuchang Su Kun japonica high 77.5 yuan, and second-grade 73-74 yuan. Qingpu thin broken ordinary sells for 75-76 yuan, and Nan Gang early broken sells for around 71 yuan per dan (斛 - a unit of dry measure).</p>
<p>New japonica varieties from various sources arriving in Shanghai yesterday by land and water were approximately 2,500-2,600 shi (石 - a unit of dry measure). Sales were mediocre, and the market fell by four or five jiao. The opened prices are: new japonica 71 yuan, Taicang Jiading Yanjian sold for 60 yuan per dan, and Dujian sold for 60.5 yuan per dan.</p>
<h3>Phoenix Flour Settles at 15.7 Yuan, Wheat Supply is Slightly Improved</h3>
<p>Flour: Spot flour continued to be in demand yesterday, because the supply from the Fufeng and Fuchang factories was limited, which was insufficient to meet demand in the trade. Each bag sold for 16.8 yuan, and there was no surplus to supply. It is said that the trade purchased over 2,000 bags of Red Plum brand no. 4 flour from the Fufeng factory at a price of 15.23 yuan to meet the needs of retail sales. Other flour such as inland and foreign flour all shouted higher prices but were rarely actually transacted. It has been decided that the futures contracts from the Japanese-owned Phoenix brand will be settled regardless of the transaction price. It is said that this matter was settled between buyers and sellers at 15.7 yuan, and is now being negotiated. Market trading continues to be at a standstill.</p>
<p>Wheat: Yesterday the supply of wheat was slightly improved because a small amount was transported from places such as Taicang, Danyang, and Chuzhou. The Japanese mill's foreign exchange rate was only around 21 yuan, and the cargo owners were unwilling to sell, so only 1,000-2,000 bags were sent to the mill for unloading. The Chinese mills received over 2,000 bags of Danyang and Taicang wheat at a price of 24.6-24.65 yuan. It is also said that the inland trade also bought 100 bags of Chuzhou new wheat at a price of 24.65 yuan, and the market is firm.</p>
<h3>Securities: Small Trading in Domestic Debt</h3>
<p>The black market for securities yesterday fluctuated slightly. After falling sharply by six or seven jiao, it recovered slightly. The market seemed to be slightly firmer because trading was small from the opening of the market in the morning until close to the afternoon closing. Speculators in the market frequently changed from bullish to bearish at any moment. Yesterday, at the morning open, the No. 7, No. 41, and Tongkang stocks were bought slightly, while Yongfeng and Hengfu were sold, and the market price fell slightly by three or five jiao. In the afternoon, it continued to be weak. Class C stocks broke through the four yuan level, and Yongkang, Tongkang, Datong, etc. had considerable demand. The market then followed the trend, changing from bearish to bullish, and Class C stocks rose again by several jiao. However, sellers such as Shunchang, Lianhe, Hengfu, Yongfeng, etc. continued to sell, so the market price was still about two or three jiao lower than the previous day. The trading volume was about 800,000-900,000 yuan. A brief summary table is listed below.</p>
<p>In stock trading, 600 shares of China Electric Company were traded at a price of 6 yuan. The late-night market opening at the Public Chamber of Commerce continued the firm trend of the previous day, and all stocks generally rose again. Wheelock Marden was traded heavily at a price of 86.5 yuan. There was a slight disturbance in the morning due to the news from Vietnam, and prices fluctuated greatly, but there was no sign of softening. The trading volume of industrial stocks was very common, while rubber stocks were very sluggish.</p>
<p>London, 19th (Friday) Cable: The listed prices of Chinese foreign debt and Far East British companies' stocks remained calm today, with minimal price fluctuations. Hong Kong &amp; Shanghai Bank shares fell by one shilling and three pence, priced at eleven pounds. Gula-Kalumpang Rubber Estates rose by seven and a half pence, priced at fourteen shillings and four and a half pence. The rest remained unchanged.</p>
<h3>China Thread Company's Capital Increase: Subscription Exceeds Tenfold in One Day; Allocation Proportional to the Number of Shares Subscribed</h3>
<p>China Thread Company, managed by Reiss &amp; Co., offered 400,000 new shares on the 19th, with a par value of 5 yuan per share and a price of 5.5 yuan. After the opening of the subscription, by 10:30 a.m. on the same day, the subscription amount had reached 21.5 million yuan, exceeding the original share amount by tenfold. It is said that the company allocates shares proportionally, with those subscribing for 500 shares receiving 20%, those subscribing for over 1,000 shares receiving 10%, and those subscribing for over 10,000 shares receiving 5%.</p>
<h3>Yarn &amp; Cotton: Major Speculators Seize Opportunity to Sell High; Cotton Yarn Goes from High to Low</h3>
<p>The yarn market, which had been rising the previous day, re-entered a revolving path yesterday. This was because Hong Kong buyers were significantly less active than the previous day, so although the bulls maintained support, they released a small amount of their positions, which they considered excessive, given the lack of significant improvement in the actual situation. As a result, the market fell from high to low, but the general sentiment still tended to be bullish. In short, the stock reserves are sufficient, but without a steady stream of sales, the market will be difficult to prosper.</p>
<p>Spot Yarn: The market opened with bulls making a play on the firm market situation of the previous day, and the shouting of higher prices was chaotic. However, a large number of major speculators took the opportunity to sell, and the opening price of 20s Double Horse was 1,019 yuan. There were many sellers, and the market immediately relaxed. At the same time, rumors returned to quiet the market, and the market fell from high to happy, dropping to 1,004 yuan. Then, the bulls came back to cover short positions, and a few packages were bought back, returning to 1,007 yuan at the close. It was found that the half-day trading volume was 3,145 packages, and the price of 20s Double Horse rose by 2.5 yuan. The amounts bought by each trade are listed below:</p>
<p>Trade 2,290, Hong Kong 855, Total 3,145</p>
<h3>Cotton Mill's Appetite Slightly Moves</h3>
<p>The spot cotton situation has been slightly more active, but large-scale transactions still cannot develop, but it is more active compared to before. The spot cotton transaction prices are listed below:</p>
<p>Wesson 234.00, Toyota Mill bought 200 bales</p>
<p>Great China 225.00, Xinsheng Mill bought 200 bales</p>
<p>Xindonggou 180.00, Guangdong Mill bought 100 bales</p>
<p>Secondary Great China 154.00, Rongfeng Mill bought 112 bales</p>
<p>Pengjiapu 224.50, An Yu bought 200 bales</p>
<p>Also 123.50, Also 100 bales</p>
<p>Fire Machine Cotton 155.00, Sen Tai bought 120 bales</p>
<p>According to further news, the foreign cotton market price: the New York cotton market initially rose due to speculative buying, and then due to good spot transactions, and Wall Street buying, the closing price was eight or nine points higher than the previous day. India fell one rupee yesterday.</p>
<p>Shanghai's foreign cotton transactions have recently been slightly more active because the price of yarn has loosened. The mills are only making small transactions, buying only those with low prices. The Japanese side has rumors of continuing to reduce work, so there is no news of transactions in recent days.</p>
<h3>Silk &amp; Tea: Japanese Silk Comes to Shanghai for Promotion, Affected by American Thrifting</h3>
<p>According to a certain foreign firm, Japanese silk will be coming to Shanghai soon, and it is said that two boxes of sample silk have already arrived. The silk uses two strands of silk to form a thread, which is most suitable for silk factories. It is also said that this year's Japanese silk production is approximately 710,000 packages, a decrease of 17% compared to last year. However, European sales are currently cut off, and American sales are also affected by "Nylon," a new artificial silk that is quite popular in the United States (47 out of 494 hosiery factories in the United States have completely adopted nylon for hosiery), so in recent times, actual sales of Japanese silk in the United States have often been around 15,000 packages, i.e. a total of 180,000 packages per year. Japanese silk will inevitably have a surplus of 530,000 packages to find a way out, so it is quite possible, based on the circumstances, that Japanese silk will come to Shanghai recently. However, the cost of Japanese silk is more expensive than Chinese silk, and Chinese silk factories may not be able to use it.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Trade in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Cloth is Exclusively Dominated by Japanese Merchants</h3>
<p>The cloth market trend is flat, and actual sales are sluggish. This is because the transport of goods from Guangdong, Fujian, and eastern Zhejiang is intermittent, and the handling of goods is not smooth. There is a rumor that the trade in cloth in the guerrilla areas of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui is entirely dominated by Japanese trading houses, and the market atmosphere is increasingly dim. Stockholders also lack interest. Yesterday, cloth prices had little fluctuation. Hand goods are cheaper than factory goods by 2.5 jiao. The trade transacted over 300 pieces of gray cloth, colored cloth, and velvet. The Zhejiang-Fujian traders transacted over 200 pieces of colored cloth and coarse cloth. The Guangdong-Hong Kong traders transacted over 200 pieces. The northern Yantai traders transacted nearly 100 pieces of heavy coarse cloth. 2,030 pieces were shipped to Yantai on the 21st.</p>
<p>There were few transactions by buyers on the east side, but the sentiment in the market was more lively, and the selling price was slightly higher. The closing price for 12-pound Longtou fine cloth futures was 32.75 yuan, and Four Gentlemen drill was sold at 9 jiao, 2 fen, and 2.5 li (厘 - a very small unit of currency) per yard.</p>
<h3>Dried and Preserved Goods: New Goods of Powdered Vermicelli and Black Dates Enter the Market</h3>
<p>The prices of Tianjin red dates have been rising recently because of the need to settle in foreign exchange (US dollars). The inventory of over 200 packages that were opened earlier has risen by ten to several yuan each. Jujube King is 85 yuan, then asked for 90 yuan, Jujube Head is 80 yuan, Show Household is 74 yuan, and Secondary Household is 64 yuan. Dozens of packages of new black dates have arrived, and the goods are average. Hand goods are opening at 50 yuan.</p>
<p>New Jiangbei powdered vermicelli has recently arrived at 24 yuan. Because the inventory bottom is empty, the market is quite good, opening as high as 85 yuan, also a new high price.</p>
<h3>Oil Cakes: Raw Oil Falls Sharply</h3>
<p>In yesterday's oil market, the soybean oil market was mild. Both sides were paying attention to raw oil, the scope of buying and selling was limited, and prices remained the same. 20 barrels of Dalian oil, 100 dan (擔 - a unit of weight) of refined oil, and 350 dan of Dayou Yu factory oil were transacted. Peanut oil was highly speculative, so its waves of rise and fall were unpredictable. Continuing the weary winds of the previous day, it immediately fell at the open. Afterward, there were widespread rumors that Qingdao reported continued increases, but the Japanese are buying them to ship to Shanghai, causing panic. Selling was widespread, and prices frequently fell. As a result, it rose slightly at the close, but it was still down two yuan from the previous day. The spot price was inevitably affected, and also fell two yuan. 70 pieces of Chefoo raw oil were transacted at a price of 66 yuan, and 150 pieces of Jiaozhou raw oil were transacted at 66.5-66 yuan. 250 pieces were booked for delivery in late September at the same price as the spot oil, 500 pieces were booked for delivery in early October at a price of 66.5-67.5 yuan, and over 2,000 pieces were booked for delivery in late October at a price that fell from 69 yuan to 67.5 yuan. The closing price was 68 yuan. 100 barrels of Qingdao raw oil were transacted at a price of 93 yuan, and 50 barrels were booked for delivery in early October, also at 93 yuan, and 100 barrels were booked for delivery in early November at 93.5 yuan.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market Sugar Prices Continue Tight</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market trend remained tight. The guild sold off. Spot prices for "Erligao" coarse white sugar from local warehouses were 78.50 yuan, up 50 cents yesterday. Imported sugar was also 78.50 yuan. Re-export sugar initially sold for 63 yuan, later rising to 63.50 yuan, up 70 cents. Dutch refined white sugar (BS mark) was 73.50 yuan. Dutch raw sugar ("" mark) was 63 yuan, up 50 cents. Road sugar was 62 yuan. Taikoo refined white sugar (B mark) was 76.50 yuan, up 50 cents. CW mark was 75.50 yuan. DY mark was 73.40 yuan, up 10 cents. KX mark initially sold for 73 yuan, quickly rising to 73.40 yuan, up 40 cents. H mark raw sugar was 62.50 yuan. First-grade ice sugar was 96 yuan. Crystal-clear ice sugar was 97.50 yuan, with little fluctuation. Hao Fang offered 50 bags of Surabaya Green (Java Green produced in Holland), priced at 74 yuan. The asking price for domestic "Diao Qing" sugar was tight, but buyers were still 1-2 yuan short of the asking price, so no deal was made. 268 bags of sugar arrived from Hong Kong.</p>

<h3>Public Concession Tram Workers Suddenly Launch a Strike Wave All Lines Halted Yesterday Morning Authorities Highly Concerned, Mediating</h3>
<p>Five hundred workers, including coppersmiths from the Beikaier Road depot of the British-owned tram company, requested improved conditions on the 10th of this month due to difficult living conditions. After taking slow-down action on the morning before yesterday (the 19th), yesterday morning at 5:00 AM, two thousand ticket conductors from the company also suddenly joined the work slowdown, causing the situation to escalate. The company's operations could not continue. Yesterday, all tram and trolleybus lines in the Public Concession were completely halted, causing serious disruptions to the city's transportation. The reason for the ticket conductors' work slowdown was also due to unsuccessful demands for improved treatment. However, according to sources from the management side, the striking workers never consulted with the company beforehand and only presented their demands after the work slowdown began. The Concession authorities are paying close attention to this labor dispute due to its significant impact. Yesterday, representatives from the Industrial Section and the Political Division of the Shanghai Municipal Council were dispatched to investigate and worked diligently in the afternoon to facilitate a peaceful resolution of the dispute.</p>
<p>Workers Put Forward Four Demands</p>
<p>Workers from the company's coppersmith, ticket conductor, and driver departments have presented four demands for improved treatment to the management: (1) Cancellation of the company's original rice subsidy, with each person receiving five "dou" of rice per month; (2) Each worker to receive a daily miscellaneous expense allowance of one yuan; (3) An increase of five cents in wages per hour of work for workers; (4) Short-term workers with more than six months of service to be considered long-term workers. The above conditions were originally presented to the acting manager of the company by the coppersmiths' representatives at 2:00 PM on the 19th. Because they were rejected, they first took slow-down action, and only yesterday did they take unified action with the ticket conductors.</p>
<p>All Lines Completely Halted</p>
<p>Due to the general strike by the ticket conductors, the company's vehicles did not leave the depot and all lines were completely halted. These include: (A) Trams: Line 1 (The Bund to Jing'an Temple), Line 2 (Yangjingbang to Jing'an Temple), Line 3 (Dongxin Bridge to Maigen Road), Line 5 (Xiaobeimen to North Station), Line 6 (Yuan Road); (B) Trolleybuses: Line 14 (Zhengjia Muqiao to North Station), Line 16 (Sanyangjing Bridge to Caojiadu), Line 17 (Dapu Bridge to Sichuan Road Bridge), Line 18 (Xieqiao to North Station), Line 19 (Sanyangjing Bridge to Yichang Road), Line 20 (Zhaofeng Park to New Customs Wharf), Line 21 (Sichuan Road Bridge to Yichang Road), Line 24 (Xiaoshadu Road to West Gate). Due to the strike of the British tram company, the French tram Line 5 and trolleybus Lines 17 and 18 also suspended service to the Public Concession.</p>
<p>Public Buses Overcrowded</p>
<p>Since the complete halt of trams, transportation in the Public Concession now relies solely on the British public buses. Yesterday, there were reports that some workers from the company's coppersmith department had also taken slow-down action, but this was denied by company officials. Yesterday, all British public bus lines continued to operate as usual, and business was exceptionally busy due to the tram stoppage. To prevent the public buses from becoming too crowded, the company specially allocated a dozen or so additional buses to join the various lines to meet passenger demand.</p>
<p>Authorities Highly Concerned, Mediating with All Efforts</p>
<p>The Political Division and the Industrial Section of the Public Concession Shanghai Municipal Council consider trams to be a public transportation utility. If the labor dispute is allowed to drag on, it would have a significant impact on the order of the Concession. Therefore, detectives Gao Yangen and Gu Bingyuan were specially dispatched to the company and the labor side to mediate. However, since the intentions of the two sides were still difficult to reconcile, no resolution was reached. It was decided to continue persuasion. The police authorities, fearing that the striking workers might cause other disputes, specially dispatched a large number of detectives to be stationed at the head office on Suzhou Road, the factory on Huasheng Road, the Jing'an Temple depot, the Hed Road depot, and the Beikaier Road material depot to provide protection.</p>
<p>Operations in the French Concession Continued as Usual</p>
<p>Due to the impact of the British tram stoppage, all tram lines in the French Concession stopped entering the Public Concession yesterday. Trolleybus Line 17 only ran from Dapu Bridge to the Great World. Line 18 only ran from Xieqiao to the Great World. Line 24 ran from West Gate via Route Lafayette to Route Albert (Avenue Foch). Routes 3 and 5, which run from West Gate to the North Railway Station, were also suspended in the French Concession because their main business was in the Public Concession. Yesterday, French tram and bus lines were also quite crowded, and the companies allocated additional vehicles to join the service.</p>
<p>Strike Developments as Reported in Western Newspapers</p>
<p>The English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" reported that approximately eight hundred Shanghai Tramway Company employees, including drivers, ticket sellers, and coolies, were incited by striking coppersmiths from the company's Beikaier Road depot machine shop and began striking at 4:30 AM yesterday, resulting in the complete disappearance of trams from the streets yesterday. Subsequently, at around 5:30 AM, workers from the Connaught Road branch of the China General Omnibus Company also took action in response and began a</p>
<p>Sit-Down Strike</p>
<p>Inciting other employees and workers to join. Yesterday morning, an official from the tram company stated that the striking workers had not yet presented any demands, and the bus workers had adopted the same attitude. Yesterday morning, the police authorities increased the number of police officers stationed at the offices of the two companies</p>
<p>To Prevent Any Accidents</p>
<p>A reporter from the "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" inquired about the strike situation with Arno Jones, secretary of the bus company, who replied that there were no disputes and everything was as usual. Yesterday morning, the Concession police authorities reported the same situation regarding the labor dispute, but the buses were still</p>
<p>Operating as Usual</p>
<p>Until 12:30 PM yesterday, the bus authorities expressed to the workers their willingness to consider their demand for an increase in cost-of-living allowances, so the labor dispute was temporarily resolved. Traffic Manager Zheng Dela of the company mediated the labor dispute and promised the workers that if the authorities accepted the workers' demands, a separate announcement would be made on Monday.</p>
<h3>Xie Jinyuan Cables British and American Authorities, Appealing for Justice; Shanghai Municipal Council Remains Silent; Situation Generally Stable Yesterday</h3>
<p>Since the unfortunate incident at the Lone Army Barracks, several days have passed. Local Chinese residents deeply regret the inappropriate measures taken by the Shanghai Municipal Council. Yesterday, the Shanghai Municipal Council remained silent, responding to inquiries from Chinese and foreign journalists with, "No information to release." A reporter from the Pingming News Agency inquired with senior officials of the Shanghai Municipal Council but received only the response, "The Shanghai Municipal Council is continuing its investigation." However, it is understood that the Lone Army Barracks is still surrounded by White Russian detachments of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps.</p>
<h3>Xie Jinyuan Cables British and American Authorities</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Regiment Commander Xie Jinyuan sent a cable to the British and American authorities, the text of which is as follows: "To the English-language *Shanghai Evening Post*, please forward to President Roosevelt of the United States and Prime Minister Churchill of London, and appeal to people worldwide. We are the eight hundred Lone Soldiers who, in October 1937, were ordered to cover the retreat when our troops in Shanghai shifted positions, holding fast to the Sihang Warehouse. Because we were close to the concessions, and bullets were flying, endangering the lives and property of Chinese and foreigners, the Consular Body authorized Major General Smolan-Toru, Commander of British Defense Forces, and others to jointly request that our Supreme Commander order us to break through the blockade and retreat into the concession. For three years, we have been imprisoned here, and we have consistently maintained order and have not overstepped our bounds. Furthermore, all our expenses have been paid on time by our government, and the Shanghai Municipal Council has not borne a single cent. On August 8, 1938, the Flag Incident occurred. After the Shanghai Municipal Council sent representatives to negotiate, we were allowed to raise the national flag of the Republic of China on commemorative days, but we were subjected to violent suppression, resulting in the deaths of four soldiers and injuries to one hundred and seven, exceeding the price we paid for holding the Sihang Warehouse by more than three times. On the 1st and 2nd of this month, amidst heavy guard, barbed wire was erected, leading to conflict. The Shanghai Municipal Council used water cannons, liquid gas, and bayonets in cruel and oppressive ways for three years. At that time, twenty-five soldiers were injured, and on the 2nd, when soldiers spoke to pedestrians on the road, they were shot by White Russian detachments, resulting in one death and one serious injury on the spot. Since the 2nd, all communication with the outside world has been completely cut off, and food and vegetables are not allowed to be delivered. Citizens, moved by righteous indignation, throw items over the wall but are beaten and arrested. Electricity is also cut off because we allegedly have radios to listen to news from the outside world. International law stipulates that the treatment of prisoners must conform to humanitarian standards. I respectfully appeal to you to uphold justice for us and maintain international law and world civilization. I earnestly hope and pray. Xie Jinyuan, Regiment Commander of the Chinese Sihang Lone Army, bows in respect."</p>
<p>Situation Still Calm Yesterday</p>
<p>The English-language *Shanghai Evening Post* reports that the situation at the Lone Army Barracks on Jiaozhou Road was calm this morning (the 20th). Although the morale of the Lone Army remains uneasy, no further disturbances have been reported. A spokesperson for the Shanghai Municipal Council stated this morning that the situation remains unchanged and that the Council will only use the most peaceful means to restore order in the Lone Army Barracks. The Council is currently awaiting the Lone Army leaders to first take conciliatory action, without which the Council will not begin discussions or negotiations.</p>
<p>The Dead Temporarily Buried, the Wounded Sent to Hospital</p>
<p>During this incident at the Lone Army Barracks, the White Russian detachments recklessly used tear gas and opened fire. In addition to one person killed on the spot, more than twenty people were injured. It is now reported that the deceased was temporarily buried in the Lone Army Barracks yesterday. All the soldiers in the camp were deeply saddened. Gao Guangrong, who suffered a gunshot wound to his right leg, was also taken to Renji Hospital for treatment yesterday. Jia Yuexian was stabbed in the leg, and Chen De'an and Fan Shengbao suffered severe tear gas injuries and were also taken to the North Sea Road Police Station Hospital for treatment. More than twenty other injured people remain in the camp. Regiment Commander Xie Jinyuan did not allow them to be sent to the hospital.</p>
<p>Reader's Letter Expressing Concern</p>
<p>Yesterday, a reader of this newspaper, Yang Hui, wrote: "To the esteemed Editor, I am writing to express my indignation at the brutal treatment of the soldiers of the Lone Army Barracks on Jiaozhou Road on the 14th, followed by the tragic killing of our brave men in the French Concession, which words cannot describe. (Omission) Alas, let us not speak of the contempt of others. Are our compatriots, whom they defended with their lives, unmoved? Although this is the concession, and power is in the hands of others, our compatriots account for 99% of the population. In the social, industrial, and commercial sectors, they also hold considerable positions. If they could work together, they could negotiate with the local authorities. Today, the soldiers of the Lone Army are demanding the lifting of the blockade and the restoration of freedom. Setting aside the restoration of personal freedom, which is related to politics, the request to lift the blockade in order to obtain freedom of life and action is not excessive. Can all compatriots in the city not lend a helping hand? (Omission) I hope that you, sir, will convey my humble opinion on my behalf to comfort my loyal heart. With this special request, I wish you good health. Sincerely, Yang Hui, September 19th."</p>
<h3>German Embassy Hosts Press</h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the European war, Ke De, the Information Officer of the German Embassy in China, has held information meetings every Thursday at the International Hotel to maintain close contact with the Shanghai press. Due to the hot weather, the meetings were changed to once every two weeks and held at the German Embassy at No. 2 Beijing Road. Yesterday was Thursday, and Ke De hosted a dinner at the Xinya Restaurant on Nanjing Road at 8 PM to celebrate with reporters from Chinese newspapers. More than fifty representatives from various newspapers and news agencies attended. Ke De, Embassy Secretaries Jiao Huafu, Fei Zongzhi, Jiang Zhaofeng, General Manager Mei Zuishi and Editor-in-Chief Liu Zongyue of Haitong News Agency, and officials from the German Consulate in Shanghai were present to warmly greet the guests. The party ended with the guests and hosts enjoying themselves until after 10 PM.</p>
<h3>French Consul General in Shanghai, Orin, Leaves Shanghai Yesterday; Vacancy Temporarily Filled by Deputy Consul Duval; New Consul General Magli to Arrive in Shanghai Next Month</h3>
<p>French Consul General in Shanghai, Orin, left Shanghai yesterday on the President Hoover mail ship. Government officials stated that Orin was returning to his country to take up a new position in the government. However, according to private French expatriates, Orin was leaving his consular position in the Vichy government to join General Tegor's movement. An official of the French Consulate resolutely denied the news that Orin had joined General Tegor's movement, saying that the news was completely inaccurate. Orin was traveling to the United States and then to France and has not left his consular duties.</p>
<p>Officer to England</p>
<p>The official also said that he had not heard anything about four French military officers leaving Shanghai soon for the United States and then to London. When asked by reporters whether the news that several French expatriates would also be leaving Shanghai soon for London was true, he only said that it might be the case. He said that the new Consul General Magli, who will succeed Orin, will arrive in Shanghai next month. Before the new Consul General arrives, Orin's vacancy will be temporarily filled by Deputy Consul Duval, who will act as Consul General.</p>
<p>Rumored Retirement</p>
<p>Another report states that French Consul General in Shanghai, Orin, left Shanghai yesterday with his wife and children on the President Hoover mail ship, traveling to France via the United States. Orin has served as the French Consul General in Shanghai for three years and has jointly managed the affairs of the French Consulate in Shanghai with Consul General Baudazzi, who left Shanghai and returned to France three months ago. It is not yet known whether Orin will continue to serve in the French diplomatic service after returning to France. It is generally believed that Orin may retire in accordance with the recent order issued by the Vichy government regarding the age limit for government officials. There is no official news about Orin's successor, but it is generally known that the Vichy government has appointed Mattiri La to succeed him. Mattiri's father once served as the French Ambassador to Germany.</p>

<h3>Mounted Police Unit to be Disbanded on Schedule; Farewell Drill to be Held; Inspection to be Held at Gordon Road Police Station on the Afternoon of the 23rd; Unit Has Been Established for 75 Years</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Police Mounted Patrol Unit, which was previously proposed for disbandment by the Shanghai Municipal Council's Economic Committee and approved by the Board of Directors, is scheduled to hold its final inspection at the Gordon Road Police Station at 2 PM on the 23rd of this month. The Chairman of the Board of Directors, Ke Zaiwei, will serve as the inspecting officer.</p>
<p>Solemn Farewell Drill to be Held</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Police Mounted Patrol Unit is scheduled to disband after a simple and solemn ceremony at the Gordon Road Police Station at 2 PM on the 23rd. The ceremony will take the form of a farewell drill. Chairman of the Board of Directors Ke Zaiwei and Chief of Police Bao Wen will attend the ceremony. They will first inspect the Mounted Patrol Unit with senior police officers, and then inspect the unit's drill. The Police Band will play music in the arena, and many police officers will also attend to observe.</p>
<p>Its History Dates Back a Long Time</p>
<p>The disbandment of the Mounted Patrol Unit is one of the many thrift plans recently announced by the Shanghai Municipal Council. All 26 members of the Mounted Patrol Unit will be incorporated into other departments of the Police Force. The exact date of the establishment of the Mounted Patrol Unit cannot be verified, as is the case with many other police records. Although historians have made great efforts to study it, they have not been able to determine it to this day. However, it is generally believed that the Mounted Patrol Unit was founded in 1865, as the budget of the Shanghai Municipal Council first contained an item for feed in that year.</p>
<p>Loss of Importance in the Age of Progress</p>
<p>Initially, the Mounted Patrol Unit patrolled Jing'an Temple Road (at that time, the road was still outside the concession). About 20 years later, the Indian Police Unit was established, and the number of Mounted Patrol Unit personnel also increased. Subsequently, the Indian Police Unit continued to increase, reaching 524 people today. The Mounted Patrol Unit gradually lost its initial value due to the appearance of motor vehicles and other mechanical transportation tools. However, it still maintained a strength of 26 mounted patrolmen, continuing its task of patrolling the roads outside the concession until its disbandment today.</p>
<p>Serving as Escorts, Imposing Appearance</p>
<p>For many years, the Mounted Patrol Unit has led the way in all grand parades and troop deployments. Their imposing appearance is well-known to the public. Of the 26 members of the Mounted Patrol Unit, there are two foreign and two Indian police officers, and 22 Indian constables, most of whom have served in the Indian Army. The unit has more than 40 steeds, most of which were donated by local horse owners. Now that the Mounted Patrol Unit has been disbanded, the horses will be returned to their original owners, including some famous horses that have excelled at the racecourse.</p>
<h3>Foreign Missionaries Arrive in Zhejiang by Indirect Routes to Provide Disaster Relief in Ningbo, Carrying a Large Quantity of Medicine</h3>
<p>More than 30 missionaries of American, British, French, Italian, and other nationalities from major churches in Shanghai were previously stranded in Shanghai due to the interruption of shipping. They then took the Far East Company's Hana ship to the interior, but were intercepted by Japanese warships and forced to return. It is now learned that several of them have left Shanghai by ship and traveled to eastern Zhejiang, carrying a large quantity of daily medicines. They will provide medical assistance to residents injured in the bombing in Ningbo and other bombed areas.</p>
<h3>Haida Ship Entered Port Yesterday Morning, Carrying a Large Quantity of Foreign Rice, Estimated at More Than 26,000 Bags, to be Unloaded Today; Ship Was Detained at the Mouth of the Song River for Five Days</h3>
<p>It is now learned that the China-Lune Shipping Company's Haida ship recently transported a large quantity of foreign rice directly from Saigon to Shanghai, estimated at more than 26,000 bags. On Thursday (the 15th), when it arrived at the mouth of the Wusong River and was about to enter the port, it suddenly saw a Japanese warship parked nearby flying a flag and ordered it to stop and anchor. The owner of the Haida ship saw this and immediately stopped and anchored. At that time, a small motorboat carrying many Japanese soldiers</p>
<p>Boarded the Ship for Inspection</p>
<p>They also questioned the crew and ordered the ship to sail to Tianjin. The owner of the ship refused, so they were not allowed to enter the port. Two Japanese soldiers were stationed on the ship. The owner of the ship immediately telegraphed the Shanghai office to report the situation. After receiving the telegram, the Shanghai office immediately reported it to the Norwegian Consulate in Shanghai, requesting negotiation for release. On the other hand, they also contacted the Japanese privately.</p>
<p>Release Was Granted Last Night</p>
<p>The ship then sailed into the Huangpu River at about 8 AM yesterday morning. At about 10 AM, it docked at the Hongxing Wharf in Pudong. The foreign rice will be unloaded today. The ship was detained outside the mouth of the Wusong River for five days. However, since the restoration of navigation in Shanghai's defense zone, the freight rates for foreign rice have been lower than before, and the production price has fallen. Therefore, rice merchants in Shanghai believe that once the foreign rice is sold and transported to Shanghai for sale,</p>
<p>Substantial Profits Can be Obtained</p>
<p>Therefore, they have been telegraphed abroad to place orders. According to sources, the source of domestic rice will continue to increase, and the autumn harvest can be predicted to begin in mid-September of the lunar calendar.</p>

<h3>Rumor that Japan is Sending Missionaries to China to Control Churches in Occupied Territories; Aim is to Exclude Foreign Church Leaders; Same Tactics Used in Korea</h3>
<p>The Mainland News reports that, according to foreign missionaries in the city, the news that Japan is sending missionaries to China to spread "purely Japanese Christianity" shows that Japan will continue to intensify its control over churches in the occupied territories of China and</p>
<p>Exclude Foreign Church Leaders</p>
<p>And force them to leave their positions. It is expected that the Japanese authorities will strictly implement the religious laws implemented in Japan within the occupied territories, aiming to consolidate the churches and end foreign assistance to the churches. In terms of the implementation of religious laws, the Japanese are in the occupied territories of China and Korea</p>
<p>Same Tactics</p>
<p>The Japanese are now taking multiple steps in North China that are the same as those taken in Korea. The so-called "purely Japanese Christianity" means that Japan will set up a national organization to strictly supervise Christian workers and ultimately remove foreign missionaries from their positions. At the beginning of this summer, officials in Tokyo told reporters that Japan would allocate more than 10 million Japanese yen to take over the work of Christian churches in the occupied territories, which is part of Japan's plan to spread "purely Japanese Christianity" in China. According to the report of the Shanghai Municipal Council Health Department on the 19th of this month, there are currently 14 shelters with a total of 17,026 refugees.</p>

<h3>Lawsuit Over the Menger Nu Film; Zhang Niankun Appeals; Believes Amount of Judgment is Incorrect</h3>
<p>Liu Zhonghao of Guohua Film Company entered into a contract with Zhang Niankun last spring, entrusting him to distribute the company's films such as "Menger Nu" in various ports in South China. In February of this year, after receiving the guarantee deposit for the film "Little Heroine," Guohua Company failed to deliver the film to Zhang Niankun for distribution as agreed and did not repay the agency fees and remuneration. Zhang Niankun then retained the films such as "Menger Nu" that Guohua Company had previously delivered. Guohua Company then commissioned lawyer Feng Xizui to file a lawsuit in the Special First Court to return the films, while Zhang Niankun also hired lawyers Lu Juntang and Juexian to file a counterclaim. As a result, the court ruled that Guohua Film Company should repay Zhang Niankun 1,800 yuan in national currency and 482 yuan, 3 jiao, and 4 cents in Hong Kong currency, and confirmed that Zhang Niankun had a lien on the company's "Menger Nu," "Romantic Wronged Soul," "Li Sanniang," and "New Hell" films for the aforementioned amount. It is now learned that Zhang Niankun believes that the amount of the judgment does not match the amount that Guohua Film Company should be responsible for paying under the contract, and therefore he is dissatisfied and has hired lawyers Lu and Tang to appeal to the Second High Court.</p>

<h3>Forty Teams Approved for This Year's Western League Soccer; Eight Teams in Group A; Twenty-Four Teams in Groups B and C; Scheduled to Start on the 19th of Next Month</h3>
<p>More than 50 teams have signed up for this year's (1940-1941) Shanghai Western Football Club, Group A, B, C, and Reserve League. The Executive Committee held a meeting a few days ago and passed eight teams for Group A and Reserve Group, and twelve teams each for Groups B and C. The total number of teams approved is 40. The eight teams in Group A (same as the Reserve Group) are the old teams Donghua, St. Francis Xavier's, French Business, Portugal, Lacrosse, North West Children, West Police, and the Jewish Club, which has just been promoted from Group B. Among the twelve teams in Group B, the new additions are McLins A, British Navy, and Yousheng. The four teams promoted from Group C are Youyou, Russian Overseas Chinese, McCarbel, and Jovens. Among the twelve teams in Group C, the new additions this year are Huamao, McLins B, Hualian, and Yizhong. Because Lido, Xifusi, and Dongsaile were unable to participate in Group A this year, the competition has been reduced.

<h3>Third Charity Basketball Game to be Held Next Wednesday; Wang Nanzhen and His Brothers Arrive in Shanghai; Competition Committee Meeting to be Held Today</h3>
<p>Due to the excessive crowding of the audience at the charity basketball challenge match the night before last, the order of the stadium was almost impossible to maintain. The third game between Liangxi and Paramount, originally scheduled to be held tonight, has been postponed to next Wednesday (15th) evening, and the time is still 8:00 pm. It is reported that Liangxi's main players Wang Nanzhen and his brother Nanqun returned to Shanghai the day before yesterday and will join the team. The Wang brothers have a reputation as national players and have long enjoyed a great reputation. Liangxi has added this new force and will have a new look. The organizers expressed their deep gratitude for the enthusiasm of the audience the night before last, but were extremely saddened by the booing of a few audience members. This kind of unreasonable behavior that is close to insult should not be directed at Paramount, which is acting righteously, and it is hoped that this kind of behavior that violates the spirit of sports will not be seen in the future. Now, the competition committee, in order to discuss the order of the venue in the future and improve it, will hold a meeting at the Paramount Hotel at 5:30 pm today. It is hoped that the chairman Zhou Jiaqi and committee members Ling Xitao, Qian Xucang, Jiang Shilin, and Pan Hongding will be prepared to attend, and no further notice will be sent.</p>

The two teams will definitely have a fierce battle when they meet today.

<h3>Kong Sheng Cup Table Tennis; Top Six to Compete in Final</h3>
<p>In the Kong Sheng Cup Table Tennis, Huayi A won all three battles last night in the Cup Group against Jiaoming at Jingwu. Jiaoming was unable to attend the two cup competitions because it had already signed up to participate in the Silver Money Cup, so it temporarily did not send anyone to the venue and automatically gave up. Huayi A won without effort and won the championship in the Cup Group. The runner-up was Evening Glow A. The champions and runners-up of each group have now been produced, and the final of the top six teams will be held. The organizers have scheduled a competition committee meeting at 8:00 pm on the 23rd of this month to discuss various matters.

<h3>Cruelty to Animals</h3>
<p>— Weng Hualuo</p>
<p>There is a piece of news in the newspaper that is worth exciting us. The headline is "The Shanghai Municipal Council Relieves the Suffering of Poultry and Livestock." The content says:</p>
<p>"The Municipal Council has received a letter from the Shanghai Animal Protection Society, stating that stores selling poultry and livestock in the area near Yuqiaqing Road and Guangdong Road often abuse poultry and livestock. Please ban them to comply with humanitarianism. After receiving the letter, the Bureau ordered the Health Department to send personnel to investigate and found it to be true. On yesterday, the fifth-third-one-six proclamation was issued, stating that: "It is known that merchants sell animals, including poultry, game, birds, and field chickens, etc., all should be treated in a humane manner. Sellers must find ways to prevent them from suffering unnecessary pain. If there is any violation of the provisions of this proclamation, the Bureau will file a lawsuit in accordance with the law." The Municipal Council has banned citizens from abusing animals more than once, but "the speaker speaks earnestly, the listener listens vaguely," and the effect seems to be small. We hope, from the bottom of our hearts, that this time the Municipal Council will earnestly implement this ban, and all citizens will also earnestly abide by it.</p>
<p>We not only hope that the abuse of animals will not be seen in Shanghai, but we also hope that the abuse of higher animals will disappear from now on!</p>
<h3>Essays A "Drenched Chicken"</h3>
<p>— Gao Yang</p>
<p>Alas, heaven truly does not "bless" people. When I went out in the morning, although the sky wore a stern face and was a little gray, there was still a glimmer of sunlight in the east, and the wind wasn't strong. I thought it wouldn't rain, so I didn't bring any rain gear.</p>
<p>Actually, I was unusually excited today because I wanted to see our soldiers. So, even if it rained, I wouldn't have worried about it.</p>
<p>I don't know if it was my rich subjective imagination, or a real fact - even the verdant lawn in the park seemed tense. It seemed to be breathing the air of battle, but the armed people added to the corners, were they real?</p>
<p>Across the fence, our heroes were standing inside. Although there wasn't a good place to stand, the "plum blossom stakes" facing the air on all sides became "stable" sentry posts, where they stood firmly.</p>
<p>It rained. The raindrops seemed to be specially looking for dry clothes to soak. The people standing there were soaked. Those standing on this side put on raincoats, but the heroes on the "plum blossom stakes" still stood bravely and unmoved. Other people's material conditions are good, but our spirit is strong. In fact, this is also forged by the environment.</p>
<p>Someone was saying, "Oh, they're going to turn into 'drenched chickens' today!" I don't know if this was a joke or sympathy, but I always feel that this spirit is great and remarkable. Deep in my heart, I offer silent respect.</p>
<p>Hunger forced me to go home, but the raindrops refused to let up. However, the heroes standing on the "plum blossom stakes" did not change shifts to eat, and just let the water hang on their bodies. I felt ashamed.</p>
<p>Okay, others can endure hardship and not be afraid of the rain, can't I run? So, I mustered my courage, made up my mind, and walked home in the heavy rain.</p>
<p>Passing by the bus stop, it was very crowded with people waiting, but the ticket seller responded with two sounds of "ding ke," and the bus continued forward. The bus was very empty, but the door didn't open. The people drenched in the rain continued to be drenched. After the bus passed, a burst of abuse arose at the station, but the ticket seller didn't care.</p>
<p>At the corner, I met a modern girl, a colleague. Seeing me, she exclaimed, "Oh, a 'drenched chicken!'" I didn't answer, just nodded.</p>
<p>Wearing high heels, barefoot, her toes were red, holding an umbrella in her hand, calling for a rickshaw, muttering to herself: "Rain is annoying!"</p>
<p>In a blink of an eye, the rickshaw carrying the modern girl ran in front of me. Thinking of the situation just now, I couldn't help but feel solemn. I also felt sad for them!</p>
<p>Arriving home, my mother greeted me with a kind smile, "Your clothes are wet, change them quickly, you'll get sick... Why didn't you take the bus?"</p>
<p>"It's okay, Mom, the wind will dry them!"</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Thoughts</p>
<h3>A Chapter of Occasional Thoughts</h3>
<p>— Ge Mo Feng</p>
<p>I detest the so-called "relying on seniority," especially when veteran writers often have no seniority to sell. After printing one or two "masterpiece collections," or plagiarizing and patching together a "guideline" or "outline" of sorts, or after releasing a "××'s Poems" with "oh-oh" sounds, they actually join the ranks of scholars, poets, or writers. From then on, they become like bulls, unable to produce even a drop of milk. If they still want to rely on their age, then dwelling on decay as something magical is probably also embarrassing, right?</p>
<p>However, the degree to which boastful "young writers" "rely on youth" is sometimes even more disgusting: grabbing a banner, scribbling some "great works," and then thinking they have surpassed everyone else; thus, they become arrogant, unthinking, and look down on the world. Even more despicable ones degenerate into "literary thugs," using yelling and threats as a career, and using ridicule and abuse as a shortcut to fame. In their arrogant and unbridled minds: "There are no predecessors, and no successors." Only themselves, it's truly lamentable!</p>
<p>Self-overflowing, boasting, and arrogance, for a literary and artistic worker, to borrow a phrase from Chekhov; these are precisely the horseflies that hinder the horse from plowing! I think: it's better to be more humble and diligent. What should be strengthened is not others, but also "oneself"!</p>
<p>"I don't dare to consider myself an Arabian thoroughbred horse, but just a pack horse. My achievements... are mostly due to my ability to work, my love of work." This is Gorky's humble and sincere confession. If you think it's not worth learning, then these kinds of "young writers" can give up!</p>
<p>Hawthorne's Detective Work</p>
<h3>The Homecoming of the Dance Queen</h3>
<p>— Written by Cheng Xiaoqing</p>
<p>Chapter Seven "Take him into Custody"</p>
<p>He asked me, "You're carrying a gun on you now, right?"</p>
<p>I replied, "Yes, it's that little gun from the drawer upstairs. Do you think Number Seventy-One would have seen Zhao Boxiong?"</p>
<p>"Probably so. Do you have cash on you? Fifty or sixty yuan will do."</p>
<p>"Yes, is it the reward for Number Seventy-One?"</p>
<p>"Yes, I didn't bring much cash. This guy worked hard because of my promise, so of course, I need to pay him in cash. He might not trust a check."</p>
<p>At this time, the car's speed was very fast, almost exceeding the prescribed limit. My nerves were also tense to a considerable degree.</p>
<p>I also asked, "Do you think Zhao Boxiong could be the murderer?"</p>
<p>Hawthorne replied, "It's hard to say. But based on the facts we already know, this person is indeed an important protagonist in this drama."</p>
<p>The car stopped in front of the side door of Yadong. Hawthorne put on those dark crystal glasses again, stuck on the fake mustache, and did another temporary disguise. He walked into the hotel door, his right hand inserted into the pocket of his navy blue serge short jacket, his eyes constantly shifting left and right, adopting a serious state of vigilance. I followed behind, of course, also cautiously. We stood in front of the elevator door for a while. When the elevator descended, six or seven people came out. I also observed carefully, not seeing any suspicious figures. The elevator went straight up to the seventh floor. We walked out and went straight to the west end of the corridor, just in time to see the Number Seventy-One waiter walking over. Hawthorne quickly grabbed his arm. The waiter was stunned, apparently Hawthorne's disguise had some effect. Hawthorne pulled him to the turning point where we had talked before, and spoke in a low voice.</p>
<p>Hawthorne said, "A-Gen, I'm Hawthorne. Have you seen him yet?"</p>
<p>Number Seventy-One looked at Hawthorne for a moment before nodding and replying, "Yes, Mr. Hawthorne. He has changed his appearance. He was originally wearing a suit, but I just saw him wearing a dark blue wool robe and a brown felt hat—"</p>
<p>Hawthorne interrupted him, his eyes seeming to burst with fire. "Does he have a short beard on his lips? Is he wearing glasses?"</p>
<p>"Yes, Mr. Hawthorne, have you seen him too?" (113)</p>

<h3>Regarding the Death of Saake</h3>
<p>— Yi Yi</p>
<p>The city's most well-organized amateur theater groups, China United, Silver United, and Bao United, will hold a joint performance this Sunday (the 22nd) at 10:00 AM at the Xuan Palace Theater. Tickets are priced at 60 cents and 40 cents. The programs are China United's "The Death of Saake," Silver United's "A Corner of the Metropolis," and Bao United's "A Wasp," all one-act plays.</p>
<p>When I pick up the pen to write this nondescript thing, I have joy and worry, because recently I have been troubled by this contradictory psychology. I am a child who doesn't understand anything, and of course drama is no exception. Directing is even more out of the question. This time, I was actually assigned to be the director of "The Death of Saake." I really don't believe in myself. I really feel a little at a loss. Fortunately, the actors in the play are all my good classmates and good friends, so I resolutely decided to rehearse this play boldly. But today, I can't help but feel a little chilly. Will a good work be damaged because of me? Will the acting talents of my friends be hindered by me? I am really worried about these two points!</p>
<p>The story of "The Death of Saake" unfolds on the stage, telling the contradictory psychology of Colonel Saake, commander of the air force during the Spanish Civil War. Because he loves his own children and also loves his great motherland, his reason and emotion are constantly clashing, but the country's laws are only one, and the country cannot sacrifice its great future because of his son's relationship. In the end, Saake resolutely decided everything and finally made a heroic sacrifice for the motherland. His son, Louis, an air force captain, is a handsome and promising young man. Although his father's death inevitably makes him sad, he immediately uses reason to overcome emotion and quickly decides to serve the country and never follow in his father's footsteps. - The old is dead, and new life, new strength is constantly growing!</p>
<p>The entire script unfolds from the opening to the closing without a minute passing in passion, tension, stimulation, and grandeur. It can also give a head-on blow to the generally昏迷 compatriots in Shanghai today. In short, "The Death of Saake" is indeed a good play, worthy of our rehearsal and presentation to everyone.</p>
<h3>Supplement to Wang Men Taoli (Peaches and Plums)</h3>
<p>— Sick Pigeon</p>
<p>In my previous work "Talking About Wang Yaoqing's Disciples," the list of Wang's disciples was based solely on memory and had not been carefully checked. Now that I have received corrections from Weiwei, I will continue to record the omissions from the previous article. However, Yaoqing has many disciples, and the author's knowledge is limited, so it is difficult to avoid leaving out some pearls.</p>
<p>Male actors: Ding Yunqiu, Su Xiaoyu (amateur), Song Dezhu, Jin Biyan, Cao Hewen (drama school student)</p>
<p>Female actors: Ma Yanyun, Hu Bilan, Zhao Shenyun, Zhu Yanhua, Deng Deqin, Zhao Jinrong, Zhang Jinfeng, Feng Yufu, Wang Jinlan, Jin Heming</p>
<p>Hou Yulan (the above seven are all students of the opera school)</p>
<p>Regarding Jiang Miaoxiang, Wang Huifang, and Mei Shang among the four famous dan, the old opera fans all know this. Wang, Jiang, Mei, and Shang are called disciples of Delin, but they have not formally apprenticed. Delin's true disciple is only Wang Qinong. At that time, the disciples respected Delin as an old gentleman because of his age. The situation was the same as Wang, Jiang, and Mei respecting Yaoqing as a teacher. I flipped through the Journal of Drama Studies published by the Peking Branch of the Nanjing Academy of Opera and Music, Volume 3, Issue 7, and found an article titled "Two Revolutionarys of Peking Opera Sheng and Dan," written by a famous writer, narrating the artistic experiences of Tan Xinpei and Wang Yaoqing in detail, with thousands of words, which can be called an immortal masterpiece. The article on Wang's disciples includes the disciples of Gu Maoxuan (Gu Maoxuan is Yaoqing's pseudonym) at the end. All the actors listed in the previous article are listed, and short articles are attached to record their brief histories. Now, I will record the appendix of Jiang, Wang, Mei, and Shang to conclude this article.</p>
<p>Jiang Miaoxiang: Yaoqing explained a lot of plays for Miaoxiang. At that time, Yaoqing was only in his twenties and slept very early. Whenever Miaoxiang came, Yaoqing would invite people to the bedroom, teach while lying down. When Miaoxiang changed to Xiaosheng and no longer played Qingyi, Yaoqing still explained plays such as "Yanmen Pass" and "Yang Balang."</p>
<p>Wang Huifang: Wang Huifang asked Yaoqing for advice the most. Although she did not formally apprentice, she had the reality but not the name. When Yaoqing was in his prime, Huifang often worked with him.</p>
<p>Mei Lanfang: Lanfang initially treated Yaoqing as an elder brother. His uncle, Yutian, once ordered him to take Yaoqing as a teacher. Some say that he had a formal apprenticeship ceremony, others say that he had not. Lanfang always called him "Mr." and sometimes called him "Big Brother," which is even more unclear. Most of his skills in the play were obtained from Wang, and most of the new tunes were created by Yaoqing's son, Shaoqing, not entirely Yaoqing's effort. The entire "Xi Shi" was mostly directed by Yaoqing.</p>
<p>Shang Xiaoyun: Xiaoyun learned plays such as "Fu Shou Jing" from Yaoqing.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Opera Company Rehearsal</h3>
<p>Since its establishment, the Shanghai Opera Company has been enthusiastically managed by President Yuan Ludeng, Ye Jun, Shi Zhibo, and Ren Zhang Boren. The company's affairs are developing exceptionally well. The original company address was greatly expanded the other day, and the internal equipment has been completely improved. The second rehearsal will be held at the Ningbo Association Hall today, and the programs are all very exciting.</p>
<p>Brief News: (1) The Lily Literary Magazine, Issue 7, will be published on the Double Tenth Festival, soliciting excellent works from all writers, including movies, dramas, women, children, and poetry. Submissions should be sent to the Shanghai post office, box number 2020.</p>
<h3>Shang Xiaoyun Will Go to Japan to Perform</h3>
<p>— Hai Xing</p>
<p>Recently, I received a letter from a friend in Peiping, stating that Shang Xiaoyun's performance in Japan has been finalized. He is expected to depart in early October for a period of one month, with a fee of 70,000 yuan. Shang Xiaoyun knows that foreigners' appreciation of Peking opera does not spark interest in Xusheng, but they love Wusheng and Wudan. Therefore, he plans to invite Zhou Ruian, Yan Shishan, etc., to cooperate and travel together. Zhou and Yan may decline the invitation, citing that the Peiping troupe is too busy. It is also said that many people have advised Xiaoyun against this move, but it seems that it is impossible to recover, lamenting what to do.</p>

Both sides are correct moves. According to the above diagram, the situation is average.</p>
