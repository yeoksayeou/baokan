<p>——祝羅斯福膺選第三任總統</p>
<p>三數月來全世界所殷切注意的美國大選問題，已於昨天獲得了最後答案；羅斯福以多數國民的擁護而克服了美國的歷史傳統與其勁敵威爾基，獲得三屆總統的連任。這一驚人但非意外的消息之傳播。當使全世界人類的大部份歡忭相慶；同時亦使妄冀於美國元首更迭之際，獲得漁利的陰謀家與野心家爲之沮喪，雖然這種希冀無非一種不根的幻想。以美國一國內部的選舉而遠勞全世界的系念，徵之往事，也許只有一九一六年威爾遜與許士的角逐差堪仿彿，彼時也正是歐戰正酣而美國則恰站在參戰的邊沿，但若以歐亞兩洲前途之安危以及正義與侵略，文明與野蠻的消長而言，則今日美國地位之重要，究非任何時代所能比擬。</p>
<p>在昨天以前，一般推測，都認爲羅氏較佔優勢，但又都以爲雙方獲票比數必極接近。而此度兩黨政綱內容，除却內政方面而外。有如國防程序，外交路綫，以至對同盟國之抗拒，與對中英兩國的支援，共和黨方面都力求與其敵黨相接近，這種宣傳與運動的侵蝕辦法，已屬羅斯福的不利，何况羅氏更冒有違反祗連二任慣例的重大弱點；然而凡此一切，並不足使選民轉而傾向在美國政治史一向佔有優勢的共和黨，結果却仍舊是羅氏獲得最大多數，開百五十年來三度入主白宮的空前新例，這是羅斯福與民主黨的勝利，也更是公意與常識的重大勝利。</p>
<p>以羅斯福與威爾基個人來比較：前者富理想，後者較現實；前者主張統制，後者傾向放任；前者是個偉大弘毅的政治領袖，後者則爲謹愼幹練的事務人材；如果現在恰是天下無事的承平年代，也許人們前進的意趣抵不住保守趨勢，因而影響羅氏前途。但在這樣一個驚濤駭浪的非常時期的政治任務，顯然不是比較保守的人物所能應付。路德喬治邱吉爾雖不能在和平時代柄政，但到此度歐戰爆發之後，張伯倫却終須掛冠，這雖是英國的事例。無形中也暗示出此屆美國元首之終將誰屬。何况美國人民有不久以前，是有過苦的經騐的：美國資產階級最幹練的經理人的胡佛，對於一九二九年經濟恐慌之束手無策，曾使美國陷入非常苦難，則在此國際政治在瀾方興未艾之際，人們自然安懲先毖後，愼選舵手。雖然威爾基的眼光能力和手腕，都較勝於前此的胡佛蘭登，却並不能轉移大多數的美人心理，甚至連百數十年的傳統慣例也無能爲力；於此足徵羅斯福物望之隆，與人民信仰之切；而前此非難新政，反對統制，以至攻擊已往施政及國防成績等等，亦適足證明其爲少數的偏見而已。</p>
<p>然而縱使威爾基獲勝，徵諸其競選政綱，也可以相信美國重大政策不致大事改弦更張；現在羅斯福旣繼續在任，駕輕就熟，其前此已付實施以及甫見端倪的種種賢明措施，當更得充分繼續運用，更無停滯或扞格之虞。而且如果前此侵略者之反對羅斯福連任是爲了要趁美國新舊交替的時機有所圖謀，則其所以反對羅氏者反而更增强羅氏應該繼續膺選的理由，現在那種企圖顯然又已落了空。以今日同盟陣錢實力之漸呈弩末之象，反侵略各國之越戰越强，更有美國偉大潛力左右其間，必能使撥亂反正偉業，速收事半功倍之效；雖然美國已在迅速完成戰時準備，事實上其是否參戰並不一定是主要的因素。另一方面，連年國際局勢的種種演變，更證明了羅氏前此的偉大抱負與過人識見，其一九三七年十月十五日在芝加哥的驚人演說就是明證。如果不是中立法的牽掣，孤立派的阻撓，以及一部分政治家和事業家的眼光褊淺，罔顧正義，則不只世界不致如此糜爛，遠東局勢早告澄淸，即民主獨立的西班牙，現當仍屹立於伊比利安半島，形成反侵略運動的重要支柱。一九三六年的大選，羅氏曾以百分之九十九的空前多數選票壓倒其政敵蘭登，獲得連任，但决年即不幸遭遇司法改革與復興運動之重大挫折；這種往事應不致重見於內外危機極形嚴重的今日，而競選過程中之雙方互詆，間涉意氣，亦望其僅爲一時的現象。羅氏旣能登庸共和黨的優秀人材組成聯合內閣，可見其絕不會讓黨派私見妨得國策的遂行。大選結局旣證明今日美國最大多數的意志所在，則此後當更能克服成見與紛歧，以及國民中任何因利忘義孤立自私的傾向，以促進其一貫堅定賢明的運用。</p>
<p>前此美方電訊曾表示近來美國對外態度之强硬，絕不容誤解爲競選中的姿態，因爲到大選完畢之後，一切益當更進於此；茲於祝賀羅斯福氏競選勝利之餘，更願其偉大抱負能速有充分的發揮。</p>

<h3 id="c42">羅斯福總統的家世 <a href="#c42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>羅斯福昨天三次當選，連任美國大總統，實爲美國史上初見的祥瑞。說句迷信話，雖則是他本人流年吉利，老運亨通，也未始小是他祖上積德，八字生得好的緣故吧！一笑。</p>
<p>如果摹仿傳記筆法，開首幾句，似乎應該這樣說：「羅斯福者，其先世系出荷蘭農家，年代久遠，湮沒難考：十七世紀時，太高祖由羅斯福村遷徙至新呵姆斯特丹，因無族氏，卽以村名爲姓焉……」</p>
<p>其實，自羅斯福總統的高祖以降，家譜紀載，斑斑可考；說他先世事蹟湮沒，無非因爲年代久遠，無籍可稽罷了。</p>
<p>現在目順次從羅斯福祖父的上兩代說起：伊薩克羅斯幅，生於七二六年，現任美國大總統佛蘭克林羅斯福的高祖。以實業起家，手創紐約第一所糖廠，鍊糖及做甜酒，積資甚豐。因爲在商界上大有地位，又兼紐約市第一家銀行「紐約銀行」的總理。經商之餘，又從事政治生涯，會六仟紐約州議員。</p>
<p>他的兒子詹姆士，卽羅斯福總統的會祖，旣藉先人餘蔭，又精於操奇計贏，問田求舍，不遺餘力。會在紐約孟哈登島置有田產四百英畝，卽現在紐約市最富麗的第五街至東河之間。他也和他又親一樣，做渦紐約的　行家。</p>
<p>羅斯福的祖父亦名伊薩克，最初習醫，因爲心腸太　，兩遷其家，最後在海特公園鎮　德遜河旁住了下來，因爲不事生產，家道遠不如其父祖時代。幸虧善人自有佳兒，羅斯福總統的父親亦名詹姆士，精明幹練，重振家聲，倒是羅氏門中的中興之「主」呢。</p>
<p>他醉心目山主義，爲民主黨之先進。將門之子，羅斯福總統可謂能繼忍受不住病人的痛苦慘狀，棄醫爲農，終其身未會懸壼。他是個好好先生，耕讀爲生，曾先人之志的了。在經商方面，他也是惆多財善賈者，會把財產投資鐵路事業，自己也仟職第拉威及赫特生等鐵路公司。因爲家道殷實，一切起居生活，無不富麗舒適。每年總要住歐洲去旅行消遣。他對於運動競賽，無所不好，尤嗜賽馬。他在海特公園鎭舊宅數里之遙又築了新居，度着優游歲月，一九〇〇年與世畏辭。</p>
<p>詹姆士曾兩娶，髮妻蕾蓓嘉霍蘭氏，係紐約富商之女，其父以經營對　貿易　　，積資鉅萬，育一兒，小名「羅賽，卽羅斯福總統之兄。繼配莎拉台拉諾女士，卽羅斯福總統之生母。一八八〇年於齊奧多羅斯福宴會席上識詹姆士，一見之下，兩情綣繾，旋卽論嫁娶。其時莎拉年二十六歲，詹姆士五十二歲。越二年羅斯福總統誕生焉。</p>
<p>羅斯福總統的太夫人現在已屆八十五歲高齡，精神還很健旺。她的父親，卽羅斯福總統的外祖父華倫台拉諾，因對華經商所積財富，在一八五七年風潮中付之東流，乃重返杳港，經營舊業。他帶了全家老小，一同飄海遠遊。除了兩夫婦外，男女小孩七個一同坐了「驚奇」飛剪號快船，繞好望角來華，在大海中飄了一百二十五天，始抵達目的地。羅斯福總統的母親，在年靑之時頗負艷名，自嬪詹姆士後，老夫少妻，　得唱隨之樂，及至羅斯福總統呱呱墮地，格外的錦上添花，夫婦倆愛如珍寶，在十四歲之前，寸步不　左有。</p>
<p>「羅賽」羅斯福，卽羅斯福總統的長兄，是個天生的享樂公子。娶妻海倫阿斯脫，是個百萬富翁的千金。「羅賽」對於聲色犬馬之好的下半截，着實嗜愛。在那時不失爲個雍容華貴的典型紳士。不幸髮妻早亡，續娶伊麗莎白利萊女士，有殊色，英國產。現住在海特公園鎮附近，常往羅　夫入處探望，因爲他們住得很近呢。「羅賽」育子女各一，女名海倫，嫁羅炳生。子詹姆士羅斯福，承受他母親阿斯脫族的鉅額遺產，還有叔叔做大總統，現在幽居在紐約的「蔲園」　　。他對於救世軍事業最爲熱心。</p>
<p>羅斯福總統生於富豪之家，加以雙親的鍾愛，自小一切都很享受，當然與不可與書通人家的子弟相提並論。至於教育，那更不成問題了。一九〇五年他和愛娜伊利諾女士結婚，夫婦甚爲相得，總統夫人早年在英國求學，極有才具。自嫁羅斯福後，相夫教子，成爲美國一位典型持家太太。不過她的面貌甚屬平庸。在小時候，她的母親曾可囑她叫她極力學好，將來成個賢妻良母。明知如果單靠她的面貌，恐怕難找到一位如意郎君呢。</p>
<p>羅斯福總統的岳母是位姿色過人的淑女，在紐約交際塲中，除了阿斯脫夫人以美色馳譽邇遐外，第二位美人兒就要輪到她了。她的照片會爲最喜收藏美女書像的審美專家所珍藏。總統岳父愛立華羅斯脫本來是位歡喜遊獵的運動家，可惜酷嗜杯中物，晚年不甚得意，一八九四年逝世。他的哥哥卽羅斯福總統的伯岳父，齊奧多羅斯福，在政治上非常有聲望。曾任美國第廿六屆大總統</p>
<p>羅斯福總統五歲時，由家長伴往白宮遊玩，並與當時的克利文大總統相見。克利文總統對着羅斯福道：「小朋友，我心中忽發奇想……我願你一輩子不做總統。」那知道這位小朋友現在却一連做了三仟總統，克利文地下有知，也要啞然失笑罷。</p>

<h3 id="c43">羅斯福大選獲勝　滬務界歡忭興奮　衆信此後援華益趨積極　維持一貫政策抵抗暴力　美僑昨日竟日注視投票發展情勢 <a href="#c43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>舉世矚日之美國大選、已於昨日揭曉、露佈下屆美國總統、行將由羅斯福氏繼任、因之本市民主國家之外國人士及中國方面、皆表示熱烈之快慰、一致爲羅氏祝賀、以羅氏於其連任期內、無論對遠東方面及歐洲方面、均採堅强之政策、反對侵略、從事保衛美國之權利、深信羅氏此後必能予中國以更大之援助也、憶上月二十六日、赫爾會對美國國家報紙發表談話、認全能國之武力侵略、已昭示美國不能再事迷信一已不可靠之安全、與獨裁者不可信之諾言、惟有繼續更積極援助中英二國、然後始能求自衛與生存、此係美若給予全世界之愛好正義和平、自由國家之諾言、於羅氏速任後、其必實踐無疑矣、</p>
<p>中外人士　莫大安慰</p>
<p>自昨晚羅斯福競選勝利之消息抵滬後、本埠中外居民、什九態度皆表示歡忭、美僑均羣相走告云、「余早已告君矣、」昨日下午赴辦公室辦事之商人甚少、大都均集於旅館總會及酒排間、互談關於此次大選之結果、同時國外電訊及無緩電、不斷以美國投票進行之情形、源源向本埠報告、引起中外人士之絕大注意、且聞本埠美國按察使署辦公室中有三人、爲地方律師、書記官·及執行吏、其職位與咋日選舉之結果、大有關係、因羅氏一旦落選、彼輩勢將與之同進退也、據美按察使海爾密克稱、美國人民在此動盪不定之時代中、選舉羅斯福連任、確爲適當之決定云、著名美籍律師樊克令昨宜稱、渠早已料知羅斯福獲得勝利、集會再三對人作此預言矣、另一美籍雜師阿樂滿稱、美國公民之投票、甚爲聰明、羅斯福之政策、主張保護美國在遠東之權益、渠深知此項政策、必將繼續實行、</p>
<p>遠東政策　更趨堅强</p>
<p>據中國方面某觀察家表示、羅斯福總統此次連任、與中國關係極爲重大、因羅斯福總統始終主張援華制日、彼之政策、已於最近數月來、更見積極、今茲連任、是彼之政策、已獲得美國民衆絕對多數之熱烈城護、則今後彼史可以全力貫澈共主張、可見美國之遠東政策、行將更見積極與堅定、威爾基氏雖亦嘗宜稱彼如當選，亦決援助中國、然共和黨孤立傾向濃厚、威氏之諾管、能否見之事實、固屬疑問、縱能實行、究不若深知遠東情勢如羅斯福者能澈底執行也、因羅氏已自其多年經騐中、體會非終止遠東綏靖政策、積極援助中國、不足以保護美國在遠東利益、爲己爲人、均不能不對華作更大助力也、且羅氏秉政八年、一切均能駕輕就熟在此世界風雲險惡之際、尤能應付裕如、故美國人民爲維持其一貫國策、以與暴力周旋、遂有此次之結果、預料今後中美關係、將益趨親密、美國在遠東之行動、亦必愈趨堅强也、</p>
<p>本市美僑　極端關切</p>
<p>據英文大美晚報消息、本市美僑對於本國總統大選、極感興趣、爲歷屆所未有、昨晨關於投票之第一次消息抵滬、謂據非止式之統計、十四州中、羅斯福總統、比之其政敵威爾基、稍占上風、此項結來本市美僑對之、發生不同觀感，擁護威爾基者、對於此項顯然事實、表示欣慰、謂羅斯福總統、不致如一九三六年競選時獲得兩倍之意外票數、於是擁護羅斯福者、亦覺羅斯福之獲選、不十分有把握、稍後的在昨晨十時、第二次消息抵滬時、謂羅斯福已在美國二十七州中、獲得優勢、將以獲得六十五選舉團票數、壓倒威爾基、擁護羅斯福者、遂大爲與奮、自滬各方人士之態度觀之、顯然同悄羅斯福者、居絕對多數，至昨晨十一時前、擁護威爾基者、又接到消息謂據非正式統計、羅斯福獲選舉團票數一八七、而威爾基亦得一四一、羅斯福在十八州中占優勢、而威爾基亦在十二州中占優勢、兩方勢均力敵、相去不速、戚爾基可有占勝和希望、十一時後、當此間接到羅斯福可獲二百十九選舉團票數、而其政敵祇能獲得八十八選舉團票數、及在二十八州中、有十九州民主黨佔優勢後、始覺威爾基　選無望、</p>
<p>假想投票　羅氏獲勝</p>
<p>本埠美國婦女總會、前日（五日）下午在會所對選舉總統作假想投票、結果羅斯福大佔勝利、計獲四十票、威爾基僅得二十票而已、擁護羅斯福之派遜斯夫人在其滔滔二十分鐘之演辭中、將羅斯福統治之利益爲之列舉、尤注意於「新政」之施行、如何產生救濟團體、及舉辦失業保險及養老金、派夫人稱、羅斯福之政府、始終爲最多數人之最大利益着想、羅氏之對外政策、以主張世界和平爲特點、輔以對民主國家除參戰外之援助、同時渠已統一南美洲各國、派夫人繼稱，羅斯福與威爾基彼此最大之不同點、爲威氏缺乏經騐、蓋威氏生平從未執政、而羅氏在過去八年間、已爲一成功之領袖云、歇里夫夫人則爲威爾基熱烈辯護並指摘羅氏美中不足之處、最後由在塲國婦女舉行投興解決之、當時英國婦女數名、亦列席旁觀、</p>
<p>英國僑民　熱烈歡迎</p>
<p>平明社記者於獲得羅氏勝利後、首向本埠英國駐滬官方探詢意見、惟云、在立塲上不欲發表意見、惟本埠英僑之權威方面、對於羅斯福總統之競選獲勝、頗表劇烈歡迎、蓋以在歐戰方酣之際、羅氏續獲競選勝利、當使英美問之關係、更臻密切、而迅速實現、蓋以羅氏一再闡明其態度、保持世界現狀與和平、而反對軸心國之侵略行爲也、</p>

<p>外棉市價、紐約棉市、昨日總統大選、故全日停止交易一天、印度市况靜寂、昨日連同預測降一羅比、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、日來繼續靜寂異常、廠方仍抱觀望態度、同業間則因目前市上現貨存底不豐、雖售價呆滯、但仍不願廉價出售也、然按目前市况、棉價將不致續跌也、</p>

<p>昨日花生油市况、因隔昨趨勢復軟、故晨初仍見下游、中途香港帮忽來採辦簍裝油、一時間人心爲之激震、市價卽冉冉上升、至午後靑島市又報漲、港帮蟬聯不懈、不下三千餘件、致一般投機囤戶、對於期貨加碼尤勁、原根及散戶拋售缺乏、交易雖不湧、但市價比上日市超出二三元不等、計成交膠州生油三千三百件、價爲七十三元、步漲至七十五元、訂十一月下交五十件、價爲七十三元七角半、靑島牛油一百五十桶、價爲一百零一元五角至一百零二元、十一月下交三百桶、價爲一百零三元跌至零二元半、復升至零四元、訂十二月下交六百桶、價爲一百零三元半至零四元七角半、烟台生油五十件、價爲七十二元五角、豆油仍尠興趣、大勢平庸、計開膠州油五十件、價詳市價欄、大連油二十桶、大　廠油五十担云、豆子一千五百包運香港、</p>

<p>本埠洋莊茶市、自地中海封鎖以來去路一落千丈、最近更因日方統制淪陷區來源、到貨竭蹶、市面愈形枯寂現僅台灣紅茶、頗有裝到混合華茶應銷外、餘均寥寥、昨市祇由孖七門興成等行、買進土莊紅茶二百二十餘箱、售價自二百四十元至二百七十元、此外松蘿旗槍等內銷茶、聞有百餘包裝出、運往天津銷售云、</p>

<p>東布　昨市以和平空氣謠傳甚熾、浮戶傾向拋賣、售盤壓小、白貨龍頭細布每疋回跌五角、上下午升降狹小、收盤價爲三十四元八角半、四君子嗶嘰跌一分二五、收盤一元零六分七五、中檔　脾細布仍因染銷尚佳、僅跌二三角、</p>

<h3 id="c89">婦女往那裏去？（一） <a href="#c89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>— 編者</p>
<p>在最近關於婦女出路問題的討論中，有一位伍祺齋先生主張婦女該回家庭去。他根據生理，心理，社會，國家，事業，目立，家庭等各點來立論，可說是「婦女回家庭去」論者的代表作。我們接到這篇稿子以後，特地轉寄給以前在本刋發表過一篇「我們的路」的江亦蕙女士，請她發表意見。要把這兩篇稿子同時在自出談狹小的園地中發表出來是不可能的，而分登叉恐怕失去了聯繫性，因此，我們準備把道兩篇稿子分期同時刊載，題目是「婦女往那裹去？」算是討論婦女出路問題的一個小結束，同時也是「自由辯論」欄的開始。以後在找到適富的題目的時候，我們將繼續舉行。</p>
<p>伍祺齋先生以爲「我們討論這大問題，決不能只從一二個人或只從某一方面來論斷的，我們當以生理心理都合常態的標準婦女作對象，從各方面加以分析研究來決定婦女究竟應該上那裏去。」</p>
<p>江亦蕙女十則以爲「我們對於所調的「生理心理都合乎常態的婦女」，應該有個正確的認識。我們要知道，一個常態的婦女，是和一切常態的男子同樣地希望在事業上進步和發展，她也和男子一樣願意有一個快樂的家庭。這些願望乃屬於人類的基本的要求。爲要增進個人的快樂和幸福，爲耍使個人對於社會能有最高度的貢獻，這些願望，在個人的生活中，應該得着合理的滿足與牛衡的發展。過分地强調婦女對於家庭的興趣，而忽視她對於社會的興趣是不對的。同時，期望一切有志從事於社會活動的婦女，都犧牲家庭的快樂，也是不合理的。因爲他們旣然是常態的婦女，他們的願望和能力，就應當有正常的發展和表現的機會。那些因爲家庭而犧牲了事業，或是因爲事業不得不犧牲家庭的事實，對於婦女個人和社會都是有害無利的。」</p>
<p>我不該多說甚麼話了，以下就是他們關於「婦女與生理」辯論的開始：</p>

<p>— 祺齋</p>
<p>（一）婦女與生理：人類得延續不絕，因爲婦女生理上有特有的「生育本能」。「生育本能」旣是婦女特有本能，影響於婦女生活當然極大。女子結婚以後，就得懷孕生育，這是誰也不能禁止的。從懷孕起，婦女生理上就發生新變化而不時需要休息，產後又至少需要四星期的休養來恢復她生理上的變動，哺乳期中也不能工作過勞致影響乳汁而害及嬰兒的健康。（關於哺乳，現在雖然有用人工方法來喂哺嬰兒的，但總不及母乳好，因爲母乳能自然隨着嬰兒的生長而調整乳中養料。所以現代醫學家，若非不得已，都主張「產母自哺」，以期嬰兒達到理想中的健康。）婦女一生能生育多决，普通每隔二年就要生育一决，所以女子結婚之後，在二年中就需要一年的不時休養，還要一年的半休養。</p>
<h3 id="c91">婦女上社會去 <a href="#c91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>— 亦蕙</p>
<p>（一）婦女與生理：從生理這一方面來說，婦女的生產能力是各有不同的。有些婦女，終身不能够生產，也有些婦女，一生中的生產决數達到八决或十决以上。但是，這兩種人，在整個的婦女之中，同樣是佔絕少數的。大多數的婦女，一生的生產决數，平均爲三至四决。在有孕的時期中，有些婦女能够一點不感覺疲乏地照常工作。也有些一婦女，因爲比較易於疲乏，只宜從事於輕便的工作。還有絕少數的婦女，在懷孕期內，需要長期的休養，一點也不能工作。這最後一種的婦女，多數是受了基本的體格上的不健全的影響，所以是不在我們討論之列的。</p>
<p>婦女每生產一次需要的休息，大的是八至十二星期。假定婦女一生中生育四决，每次需要十二星期的休息。她總共消耗在生產休養上的時間，不過四十八星期（還不到一年）。許多人一生花在病床上的時間，是這超過這時限的！一年的光陰，在整個的人生中是很短的。我們能爲了這區區的一年而埋沒婦女的終身，而犧牲她對社會可能有的二三十年的貢獻嗎？也許有人要說，影響婦女的事業的，不僅是她的生產。哺乳也限制了婦女的職業。可是，我們要知道現代的科學化的育兒方法，是不需耍母親整天地捧着孩子的。哺乳須有一定的時間，普通是每四小時一决。在這四小時以內，婦女有充分的時間，從事於任何種有用的工作。婦女工作過勞，固然可以影響乳汁，但是假如終日守在家裹，沒有正當的工作，乳汁也可以因爲過於濃厚，而影響嬰兒的消化。所以，有許多醫生，是讚成哺乳的母親應該有相當的工作和活動來調劑她們的生活的。</p>

<p>第十章　皮鞋問題</p>
<p>我們三個人本來站立在汽車旁邊的人行道上。這時霍桑首先竄過馬路，向豐泰烟紙店走去。倪金壽和我當然緊緊地跟着。霍桑走到烟紙店門口，掏出一張十元的法幣來，買一包白金龍紙烟。他的眼光小心地向烟紙店的店堂溜轉。我瞧見裹面一共有三個人，兩個是中年的夥友，一個是十五六歲的學徒，外白哦上絕對瞧不出什麽可以之處。那個招待霍桑買煙的，九十著十五六歲的學徒。霍桑一壁把找出來的法幣一張張驗看，一壁隨意搭訕地說：「你們老閻在裏面嗎？」</p>
<p>那學徒抬起目光向霍桑臉上瞧了一瞧，搖搖頭說：「出去了。你認識他嗎？」</p>
<p>這時忽有一種出我意外的景狀。倪金壽突然舉起了左手，高聲喊道：「喂，老韓，你怎麼在這裹」？</p>
<p>原來那時有一個人才從店堂後面探頭出來瞧一瞧，竟被倪金壽瞧見了。這個人本來不想走出來，被倪金壽一招呼，却不能小到外面來敷衍幾句。</p>
<p>那叫做老韓的說：「倪探長，好久不見，忙得怎樣？你那兒去」。其實那人並不老，穿一件淡灰色嗶嘰單袍，身材和年齡和我相仿，神氣上也很機警多智。</p>
<p>倪金壽答道：「隨便走走。」他放低些聲調。「老韓，這憂可有一個叫做趙伯雄的人？」</p>
<p>那老韓略略驚異地問道：一趙伯雄？有的，他剛才在這裏。倪探長，你認識他嗎」？</p>
<p>倪金壽答道：「是的，他此刻還在不在」？</p>
<p>「他已上南京去了，走了還不到十分鐘。你找他有什麼事」？</p>
<p>倪金壽略略疑遲，剛才說出了「他是」兩個字，霍桑早搶着作答：「沒有什麼。我們紙希望跟他隨便談談。倪探長走罷。」他隨手把法幣和紙烟放進了衣袋裹去！回身就走。</p>

<p>— 唯唯</p>
<p>「五人義」一戲，近年來已不常有人貼演，此戲之主角周文元，原係武生開口跳兩門抱，早年楊小樓王長林二人演此戲，均擅勝塲，此戲最不受外行歡迎，演來亦極不易討好。故晚近演者極尠，周文元一角要能唸，唸要唸得響堂。要能打，打要打得乾淨：做表神情亦極重要，配角方面，更要齊整，花面顏佩偉，丑角地葫蘆，均極更要，昔小樓演此，以錢金福飾顏佩偉，傳小山飾地葫蘆，紅花綠葉，相得益彰，洵為佳構。自小樓故後，晚近武生善演肚戲者，實不多得，有之唯富連成之茹富蘭李盛斌葉盛章而已。此三人較，盛章因原工開口跳，唸白翻跳供佳，故演來似較富蘭盛斌略勝一籌。</p>
<p>不久以前上海戲劇學校教職員演劇，瑞德寳曾貼是戲，配以梁連桂之顏佩偉，石小山之地葫蘆，但演出殊未能使人滿意，第以老瑞年事巳高，武工退化，加以嗓昔不濟，唸白亦不甚動聽，故難有好成績也。日前復觀茹富蘭演此戲於黃金，除由袁世海飾顏佩偉，孫盛武飾地葫蘆外，更輔以張連廷之大校尉，高盛虹之二校尉，淸一色富連成子弟，無不武工純熟，演來遂有如火如荼之妙，其精彩處乃為前决瑞德寳梁連佳等所不及。</p>
<p>縱觀是日茹富蘭等人所演，當以袁世海之顏佩偉最為出色，做表深情均佳，開打一場有一「飛腳」「棚子」，乾淨俐落，極見工夫。料想侯喜瑞壯年時代也不過如此，惟世海所唱牌曲，似不純熟，或係久不動此戲之故，此為美中不足，富蘭之周文元，相當賣力，孫盛武之地葫蘆亦佳，照樣翻「搶背」「吊毛」，非科班出身不克至此。張連廷高盛虹二人之校尉，亦均稱職，是日所見之「五人義」，可謂江南近年來所罕見，爰為記之如上。</p>

<p>我們知道電影中有一部「女人」，由瑙瑪希拉瓊克勞馥等十餘女明星會串，是一部沒有男人而講的却全是男人事情的新作品。當時有很多觀衆在想：要是在舞台，也能排演這麼一支全部女人出塲的劇本，那一定也能轟動於時。因為這不特為舞台劇創一新風格，卽從內容上，也能展開一個十分動人的故事。</p>
<p>中旅是上海職業話劇團之一，他們的女團員，似乎多於其它職業劇團。並且隨時發掘新人，像以秦淮世家」一片一舉成名的孫景璐，原來老早就是中旅的基本團員，這次唐槐秋忽發奇想，在秘密排演一支全體女團員出動的「女人舞台劇，而這支「女人」舞台劇業已排練純熟，明晚（八日）起即在璇宮與觀衆相見了。</p>
<p>我們不希望它的故事，像電影般，沒有多大意義，相反地可以從舞臺上的女人口中，啟示新時代的意識。以及新女性之人生觀，這是很足使我們重視的一點。</p>

<p>New York—President Roosevelt (pictured) has decisively won the election, achieving a nationwide victory and shattering all precedents in American history. By midnight, the President had a substantial lead in thirty-five states, securing a total of 425 electoral votes. Given that securing a majority of 266 votes is required for election, he has won. (Sixth International News Service Urgent Telegram)</p>
<p>Hyde Park—President Roosevelt, in a radio address to the nation this morning, stated that the United States is about to face a period of trial. The President also gave assurances regarding his third term, indicating that he would maintain the policies established during his previous two terms. (Sixth United Press Telegram)</p>
<p>Hyde Park—Some of President Roosevelt’s neighbors marched with torches to Roosevelt’s private residence. While speaking with them, Roosevelt stated that he accepted the will of the nation to serve as President for a third term in the White House. He said, "We are indeed facing difficult times for America, but you will see that the Roosevelt of the future will still be the Roosevelt of the past." He then said with a touch of humor, "This is truly astonishing. I only heard it from the news reports an hour and a half ago. You could have knocked me over with a feather." The victory of Roosevelt this time is the largest "vote of confidence" ever received by an American president. Democratic Vice-Presidential candidate Wallace also accompanied Roosevelt, succeeding Vice-President Garner. Garner did not seek re-election this time. The Democratic Party seems to have achieved a major victory across the board, with the Senate and the House of Representatives almost unanimously maintaining the Democratic Party's positions. Only in a few states did Republican candidates for governor and senator slip in. Statistics of two-thirds of the nation's votes show that Roosevelt received 16,950,796 votes, while Wilkie received 13,638,149 votes. (Sixth International Telegram)</p>
<p>Washington—President Roosevelt's victory for a third term was confirmed today at 11:30 AM (Shanghai time Thursday at 0:30 AM). However, Republican candidate Wilkie also received more popular votes than any unsuccessful presidential candidate in history. Roosevelt's re-election votes were confirmed at 9:50 AM today (Shanghai time Wednesday at 10:50 PM). At that time, twenty states, with a combined electoral vote of at least 266, supported Roosevelt. The electoral vote totals 531 votes, and Roosevelt securing 266 votes ensures his victory. Thus, Roosevelt became the first president in American history to serve a third consecutive term. After Roosevelt's re-election, his proposed "New Deal" can be extended for another four years in the White House. Chongqing's joy at Roosevelt's re-election is even greater than the reopening of the Burma Road and the recovery of Kunming. Furthermore, news reports that the total number of popular votes in the election, as announced at 9:03 AM (Shanghai time Wednesday at 10:03 PM), was 20,575,895 for Roosevelt and 17,195,962 for Wilkie. (Sixth United Press Telegram)</p>
<p>Washington—Neutral political observers here recently recognized that President Roosevelt's victory over Wilkie in the national election is a demonstration by the American people against isolationist policies and for close attention to the situations in the Far East and Europe. These observers pointed out that President Roosevelt is considered a warmonger by some American officials and the official newspapers of Germany, Italy, and Japan, and these individuals and newspapers clearly favored Wilkie. The American people, creating an unprecedented innovation by electing Roosevelt for a third term, clearly demonstrate their full support for the Far East and European policies advocated by US Secretary of State Hull. It is generally expected that after President Roosevelt's re-election, the United States will continue to adopt a strong policy in the Pacific, and American aid to Britain will be further accelerated due to the alignment of political views. (Sixth United Press Telegram)</p>
<p>New York—Responsible political figures here recently stated that Roosevelt's re-election will not eliminate the possibility of the United States being drawn into the war, nor can Roosevelt guarantee avoiding war. Roosevelt said that he would do his utmost to keep the United States out of the war. This undoubtedly means that he will bring the United States into the war when it becomes inevitable. These figures also stated that if Wilkie had been elected, at least for several months, due to the change of a new President and a new Secretary of State, Japan and the United States might have had another round of consideration regarding the Far Eastern issue. But now Roosevelt and Hull may continue, or even expand, their opposition to Japan's measures, such as embargoing scrap iron and gasoline. These figures also believe that Japan may have temporarily delayed its actions while waiting for the results of the US election, and that there may be important movements at this time. (Sixth United Press Telegram)</p>
<p>New York—As of 10:30 PM last night (11:30 AM this morning in Shanghai), the number of ballots cast in various locations were as follows: Roosevelt 4,575,920 votes, Wilkie 3,593,874 votes. Furthermore, as of 11:00 PM (12:00 PM this afternoon in Shanghai), Roosevelt's votes had surged to 6,433,958, while Wilkie's votes were 4,998,945. (Sixth United Press Telegram)</p>
<p>Washington—In the first million votes counted last night, President Roosevelt's votes were slightly ahead of Wilkie's. At 8:30 PM last night (9:30 AM this morning in Shanghai), Roosevelt had 679,396 votes and Wilkie had 509,126 votes. However, these are only scattered numbers from various locations, only enough to get a glimpse. From the votes obtained in 161 precincts in Indiana, Wilkie had a slight advantage, with 59,235 votes, while Roosevelt had 57,662 votes. (Sixth United Press Telegram)</p>
<p>New York—As of 9:30 PM on the evening of the 5th (10:30 AM this morning in Shanghai), the counted ballots listed are as follows: Roosevelt 2,626,636 votes, Wilkie 1,218,7081 votes. (Sixth United Press Telegram)</p>
<p>New York—The Democratic Party chairman claimed this morning that Roosevelt has been re-elected again. In the more than 15 million votes already seen, he obtained 56 percent and the support of 449 electoral districts, while Wilkie only obtained votes in 22 electoral districts. The New York Times now acknowledges that Roosevelt has a majority of votes in New York State. (Sixth Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>New York—The local best-selling tabloid "New York Daily News" published news last night stating that President Roosevelt has been unprecedentedly re-elected as the third master of the White House. The newspaper has consistently supported President Roosevelt but acknowledged that Republican candidate Wilkie also had a great chance of being elected. At the same time, Democratic National Committee Chairman Farley told reporters that President Roosevelt was "very satisfied" with the initial election results. He also said that the news from New York State was very exciting, proving his prediction that it "would definitely support President Roosevelt." At 10 PM last night (11 AM Shanghai time this morning), Wilkie told reporters that the election was "a horse race" that would soon end. (Sixth International News Service Urgent Telegram)</p>

<p>——Congratulating Roosevelt on His Election to a Third Term</p>
<p>The US election, which has been of intense concern to the entire world for the past few months, finally had its final answer yesterday; Roosevelt, with the support of the majority of the nation, overcame America's historical traditions and his powerful rival Wilkie, winning a third term as president. The dissemination of this surprising but not unexpected news should bring joy and celebration to most of humanity worldwide; at the same time, it will frustrate the schemers and ambitious individuals who had vainly hoped to gain from the change of the American head of state, although this hope was nothing more than an unfounded fantasy. That an internal election in the United States should cause such global concern is perhaps only comparable to the contest between Wilson and Hughes in 1916, when Europe was in the midst of war and the United States stood on the edge of intervention. However, in terms of the safety of the future of Europe and Asia, and the rise and fall of justice versus aggression, civilization versus barbarism, the importance of the United States today cannot be compared to any other era.</p>
<p>Before yesterday, general predictions considered Roosevelt to have a greater advantage, but also believed that the difference in votes between the two sides would be very close. The content of the two parties' platforms, apart from domestic affairs, such as national defense procedures, diplomatic routes, resistance to the Allied countries, and support for China and Britain, the Republican Party sought to be close to its rival party. This method of eroding public opinion and campaigning was already disadvantageous to Roosevelt, not to mention that Roosevelt took the significant risk of violating the two-term precedent; however, all of this was not enough to make voters turn to the Republican Party, which has always held an advantage in American political history, and the result was still that Roosevelt won by a large majority, setting an unprecedented example of entering the White House for a third time in 150 years. This is a victory for Roosevelt and the Democratic Party, but it is also a major victory for public opinion and common sense.</p>
<p>Comparing Roosevelt and Wilkie as individuals: the former is rich in ideals, the latter is more realistic; the former advocates control, the latter tends to laissez-faire; the former is a great and far-sighted political leader, the latter is a prudent and capable administrative talent; if it were a peaceful era of tranquility, perhaps people's desire to move forward could not resist conservative trends, thus affecting Roosevelt's future. However, in such a turbulent and extraordinary period, the political task is clearly not one that can be handled by a more conservative figure. Although Lloyd George and Churchill could not hold power in peacetime, Chamberlain had to resign after the outbreak of this European war. This, although an example from Britain, implicitly suggests who will ultimately belong to the office of the American head of state. Moreover, the American people have had bitter experience not long ago: Hoover, the most capable manager of the American bourgeoisie, was at a loss in the face of the economic panic of 1929, which plunged the United States into great suffering. Therefore, in this international political crisis, people naturally anticipate and prepare for the worst, carefully choosing a helmsman. Although Wilkie's vision, ability, and skill were better than those of the previous Hoover Landon, it could not change the minds of the majority of Americans, and even the traditional practice of hundreds of years was powerless; this sufficiently demonstrates the high esteem for Roosevelt and the people's deep faith; and the previous criticisms of the New Deal, opposition to control, and attacks on past governance and national defense achievements, etc., are sufficient to prove that they are only a minority of prejudices.</p>
<p>However, even if Wilkie had won, judging from his election platform, it could be believed that the major policies of the United States would not be greatly changed. Now that Roosevelt continues in office, he is familiar with the job, and the various wise measures that he had previously implemented and that had just begun to emerge will be fully continued and utilized, without any stagnation or obstruction. Moreover, if the aggressors opposed Roosevelt's re-election in order to take advantage of the opportunity of the change of power in the United States, then their opposition to Roosevelt only strengthens the reason why Roosevelt should continue to be elected. Now that attempt has clearly failed again. With the Allied forces gradually showing signs of strength, and the anti-aggression countries becoming stronger as they fight, with the great potential of the United States playing a decisive role, it will surely enable the great cause of reversing the chaos and restoring order to quickly achieve twice the result with half the effort; although the United States is rapidly completing wartime preparations, in fact, whether it participates in the war is not necessarily the main factor. On the other hand, the various evolutions of the international situation over the years have further proven Roosevelt's great ambition and extraordinary insight in the past, as evidenced by his sensational speech in Chicago on October 15, 1937. If it were not for the constraints of the neutrality law, the obstruction of the isolationists, and the narrow-mindedness of some politicians and businessmen, who disregarded justice, not only would the world not be so devastated, the Far Eastern situation would have been cleared up long ago, and democratic and independent Spain would still be standing firmly on the Iberian Peninsula, forming an important pillar of the anti-aggression movement. In the 1936 election, Roosevelt overwhelmed his political opponent Landon with an unprecedented majority of 99 percent of the vote, winning re-election, but in the following year, he unfortunately encountered major setbacks in judicial reform and the recovery movement; this past event should not be repeated in today's extremely serious internal and external crises, and it is hoped that the mutual recriminations and occasional emotional involvement during the election process are only temporary phenomena. Roosevelt has been able to recruit outstanding Republican talents to form a coalition cabinet, which shows that he will never allow partisan prejudices to hinder the implementation of national policy. Since the outcome of the election has proven where the will of the majority of Americans lies today, it will be able to overcome prejudices and divisions, as well as any ungrateful, isolationist, and selfish tendencies among the people, in order to promote its consistent, firm, and wise application.</p>
<p>Previously, American telegrams had indicated that the recent toughness of the United States' foreign attitude should not be mistaken for an election posture because everything will be even more advanced after the election is over; in addition to congratulating Mr. Roosevelt on his election victory, we hope that his great ambitions can be fully realized soon.</p>
<p>Preliminary Election Results Across the United States: The Vote Ratio Between Roosevelt and Wilkie is Three to One</p>
<p>Washington—After the preliminary elections held today in all election districts across the United States for the fiercely contested position of US President for the next four years, President Roosevelt's vote count has far exceeded that of Republican candidate Wilkie. Preliminary election results from all parts of the country, including the East Coast, the Midwest, the Southwest, and the "Solid South" believed to be in Democratic hands, have been urgently telegraphed here. With the numbers coming in, it is widely believed that Roosevelt has won in most election districts, breaking precedent and running for a third term as president. According to a report from Albuquerque, New Mexico, Roosevelt received 1,151 votes in 24 election districts, while Wilkie received 840 votes. According to the first urgent telegram from Topeka, Kansas, in the nine major cities of Kansas, including Kansas City and Topeka, Wilkie, one of the greatest presidential candidates in American history, has received 5,982 votes, while Roosevelt has received 5,497 votes. In the two cities of Hartford and Sprague in Connecticut, Roosevelt received 692 votes, while Wilkie received 371 votes. Roosevelt defeated Landon in that area with 612 votes to 394 in 1936. According to a report from the Baltimore election field in Maryland, in the 70 election districts where voting was completed, Roosevelt received 18,008 votes, while Wilkie received 17,162 votes.

The ancient proverb, "As Maine goes, so goes the nation," was proven to be inaccurate in the 1936 election, as Landon won in Maine but did not win in other states. Today's Republicans, regardless of whether this proverb will be confirmed, believe that Wilkie can win in the election district in that state. The preliminary election result report arriving in Augusta from Eastern Maine stated that in the 629 election districts of that state, Wilkie received 256 votes, while Roosevelt received 189 votes.

<p>London—Today, Britain is immensely pleased with President Roosevelt's great victory, recognizing that American aid to Britain will be even more substantial and increased.

<p>London—The Daily Telegraph commented on the American election, saying that regardless of who wins or loses in the American election, it will ultimately be a unified country. Today's political strife is intense, but after the election is over, it will be reconciled as before and live together in harmony. This is one of the best effects of a free political system, and it gives its country a stability that no dictatorship can hope for, as dictatorships rely only on secret police and concentration camps to force their people to obey and use murder to eliminate opposition from their people.

<p>Italy Pessimistic</p>
<p>Rome—Today, after learning of President Roosevelt's re-election, the Italian people have expressed deep pessimism about the future of the Axis and American relations.

Although the United States may not take any action within several months, from a long-term perspective, the United States will eventually become a formidable enemy. (Sixth United Press Telegram)</p>
<p>Japanese People Disappointed</p>
<p>Tokyo—Today, the only reaction in Japan to President Roosevelt's decisive election is disappointment, as the majority of opinions believe that America's Far Eastern policy, which has been dealing with Japan, has once again regained a good opportunity under the new American administration. Another reason for the disappointment here is that a considerable number of Americans approve of Roosevelt's tough policy towards Japan, so the current Japan-US relations cannot be improved. It is expected that tomorrow's Japanese newspapers will urge the government to prepare to deal with the anti-Japanese policies of the United States. (Sixth United Press Telegram)</p>
<p>Tokyo—A spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced today that regardless of who is the president of the United States, its foreign policy, especially towards the Far East, must be reconsidered, because America's current Far Eastern policy is too theoretical and does not conform to reality. When asked if US Ambassador Grew had recently met with Foreign Minister Matsuoka, the spokesman replied that he had not, but said that the acting counselor of the US Embassy, ​​Mr. Kroger, had met with the Director of the American Affairs Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Terasaki, yesterday to discuss very minor routine matters.

I know that all of us are grateful for the participation of so many American citizens in the voting. I wish you health and happiness." (Reuters, 6th)</p>
<p>New York – After receiving news of Roosevelt's lead in votes at midnight, Willkie appeared pale and tired. He then met with his advisors in his New York hotel. Republican vice-presidential candidate McNary conceded Roosevelt's victory, but Willkie still did not express despair. It is recalled that in 1916, when Hughes competed with Wilson, Hughes felt he had more votes late at night and could definitely defeat Wilson, so he went to bed peacefully. Unexpectedly, the votes in California turned Wilson's defeat into victory. At this time, Willkie still hoped that he could win the final victory like Wilson, so he refused to concede defeat and encouraged those around him in the hotel not to be discouraged.

<p>Belgrade – According to battle reports arriving here today, Italian forces crossed the Kalamas River this morning, threatening Ioannina, an important Greek transportation hub. Greek forces are concentrated there, preparing to repel the enemy. The Italian advance is meeting strong Greek resistance. According to battle reports, as Italian tanks and troops crossed the Kalamas River via pontoon boats and bridges and advanced into Greek territory, Greek forces attacked their flanks. The Italian advance, though in danger of having its supply base cut off due to the Greek attack on Albania, continues to advance towards Florina. According to the battle reports, Greek forces that have entered enemy territory have completely surrounded Korçë, so its fall is believed to be imminent, as the Greek army is advancing into Albania with amazing actions. Italian heavy artillery is bombarding Greek forces in the area, and Italian aircraft are circling and dropping bombs, but it is said that Greek anti-aircraft fire and fighters are sweeping away Italian aircraft in the air.

<p>Athens – Greek commando units in skirts launched a fierce encirclement of Korçë this morning, intending to seize the important Italian base in Albania in one fell swoop. According to Greek high command, people here expect news of the city's fall to arrive soon. The communiqué said that Greek forces are attacking the outskirts of the city with bayonets and grenades. According to military observers, the fall of Korçë will threaten an Italian column advancing towards Florina, whose supply base has already been cut off. If the Italian forces continue to advance, it will be very dangerous. At the same time, it is reported that Greek vanguards have entered Albania with amazing speed, capturing 30,000 Italian soldiers near Korçë. It is said that Italy recently used bombers and fighters to cover the attack on Ioannina, but was repelled by Greek defense forces. 4,000 Italian soldiers advancing to the Epirus front have been completely isolated from the outside world in the rugged mountains of the area. It is also learned that Greek forces have entered Albania for more than ten miles. (International News Service, 6th)</p>
<p>Athens – According to a communiqué from the Greek General Headquarters just released, Greek highland troops are fiercely advancing on the Italian base of Korçë. Other Greek troops have also captured several highlands with semi-permanent fortifications on the Western Macedonian front. It is said that some retreating Italian troops were attacked by their own tanks. When Greek troops captured the highlands, they captured two artillery pieces, several mortars and machine guns, and several Italian soldiers. The Greek Air Force attacked the airfields of Korçë and Argyrokastro, destroying several Italian aircraft and hangars parked on the ground. All Greek aircraft participating in the air raid have safely returned to base. According to responsible sources, there has been no major development in the main attack within Greece, but it is possible at any time. According to reports received from the north at 6:00 AM on Tuesday, Greek forces are now fighting on the west bank of Lake Mikri Prespa. The fighting near Dischtraton in the Pindus region is mainly related to a unit of cut-off Italian troops. It is reported that Greek forces have captured at least 100 Italian soldiers, machine guns, radios, and other equipment in this area. The Italian troops are elite Alpine troops. The Italian side believed they were trapped in Mirovo, and sent planes to drop flour and other supplies, but the troops were no longer there, and the dropped gifts fell into the hands of Greek forces. According to Greek Army Minister, Greece destroyed nine Italian tanks using British-supplied flat-trajectory guns, and two Italian bombers were shot down on Tuesday, with no losses to Greek aircraft.

<p>Athens – News from the northern front says that Greek highland troops (i.e., Evzones) are fiercely advancing on the Italian base of Korçë. Sources close to the Greek General Staff claim that the progress of Greek operations, judging from the news received yesterday, is extremely satisfactory. News from the northern front also says that Greek highland troops, armed with bayonets and grenades, have broken through the Italian defense lines around Korçë. Once Korçë falls, it will not only overturn the Italian military plans, but also have a major impact on the Albanian morale, which has been agitated under Italian control. Greek bombers attacked the Italian supply base of Argyrokastro, which supplied the coastal area of Epirus, and were very successful. Greek troops on the central front are surrounding large groups of Italian troops according to plan. Greek troops have held the places they have recently captured. Greek engineers are urgently transporting light equipment over the steep mountains and countryside to the front lines, which is especially commendable. The Greek troops are acting quickly, often attacking the Italian troops by surprise. Foreign observers in Athens are deeply impressed by the careful wording of the Greek official reports. The Greek authorities are eager to avoid creating an overconfident mood and are asking foreign reporters not to exaggerate Greek victories, as the victory of the Greek army is evident in the facts.

<p>Ohrid – It is reported that an entire Italian division of 15,000 to 20,000 men is now in dire straits and may be captured by Greek forces. Greek troops in the north, attempting to cut off the Italian retreat, have crossed the Devoll River and are advancing rapidly towards Konko (on the highway from Bilisht to Korçë), pursuing the fleeing Italian troops in front. Greek artillery is bombarding Italian positions in the Korçë area from the high mountains overlooking the highway. The report also said that Greek heavy artillery and Italian forces fought fiercely in the Pogradec area. As a result, the Greek army advanced with great force. In this battle, the Greek army suffered seven dead and thirty wounded. The Italian army suffered thirty-five dead and one hundred and fifty wounded. Three tanks and a large amount of military supplies were captured. Greek anti-aircraft artillery shot down an Italian bomber from the famous A-wing near Pogradec. Also, Greek forces advanced along a branch road leading to the small lake, assisted by light tanks and mechanized units, and occupied the village of Sagrada. In the battle on Monday night, 40 Italian soldiers and 2 officers were captured, and three tanks were captured. The Greek troops in the north, who crossed the Devoll River, are now advancing towards the highway from Bilisht to Korçë, attempting to meet with another Greek army that has reached that road. If this is successful, the Italian army will inevitably be in dire straits. (United Press, 6th)</p>

Regardless of whether the Greek war reports are reliable, one thing is clear: after a week of fighting, the Italian army has not achieved anything against the Greek defenses. All it has done is adopt Nazi methods, bombing undefended city areas and intimidating civilians. Germany has not yet pressured Turkey to take actions to support Italy. If there had been proper cooperation between the Axis powers, Germany should have taken action against Bulgaria or Turkey. Many sources say that Italy was dissatisfied with Hitler's compromise with the Vichy government and launched an attack on Greece. Now, the lack of coordination between Germany and Italy makes the Franco-German rift not without reason.

<p>General Valera, the Spanish Army Chief of the Canary Islands, came to the Canary Islands to inspect the troops. He recently gave a speech here, saying, "When Chief of State Franco deems the time is ripe and issues military orders, all comrades will have only one political goal: to lead Spain towards its historical destiny. Recall that Chief of State Franco led the army from these islands in July 1936 to overthrow the Republican government and ultimately achieved final victory. Upon my return to the capital, I will report to Chief of State Franco that you are ready for battle, and the spirit of your brave fighting when the military order is given will surely be demonstrated again." (Havas, 5th)</p>
<p>Casablanca, Morocco: The Tangier International Zone was taken over by Spanish troops on Monday. Under the command of Colonel Yeste, the Spanish troops deployed artillery positions at various strongholds in the Tangier International Zone, and then issued a proclamation stating that the Tangier International Zone had been restored as a Spanish city. Separate notifications were sent to the diplomatic envoys of various countries in the zone, stating that the international nature of the zone had ended. The so-called diplomatic missions included representatives of the United States and other signatory countries who were stationed in the Tangier International Zone. As a result of this merger by the two countries, the International Joint Management Committee and the legislature were terminated. After Spain annexed Tangier, the first thing it did was to set the silver coins of the two countries as the standard currency. In the past, the pound sterling and the US dollar were the officially prescribed weights and measures in the zone. American authorities only stated that they would remain in Tangier for a few days, and nothing was known about the reaction in Washington, especially whether the ships sailing from New York to Tangier would change their routes. Tangier is the last international joint management zone in the Mediterranean where American ships can sail directly. Some Tangier residents are convinced that Spain's annexation of Tangier this time is the result of a meeting between Hitler and Franco, and this action may be a preliminary indication of Spain's participation in the European "New Order." However, the most noteworthy aspect of this action is Tangier's strategic position, which is located on the opposite shore of Gibraltar. (United Press, 6th)</p>

<p>London: Foreign Secretary Halifax gave a speech in the House of Lords last night on the current diplomatic situation, expressing sympathy and understanding for Marshal Pétain's difficulties. However, he said that regardless of what Marshal Pétain hopes to gain by leading France down the path of cooperating with Germany, we cannot believe that a government led by an honorable figure like Marshal Pétain will lead France down the path of harming its former allies. The enemy has repeatedly proposed measures that are detrimental to France, and we have rejected them all. The Foreign Secretary also said that we now have reason to be excited about the air war situation. In the past twelve weeks, the enemy has lost 2,433 bombers and fighters, and 6,000 airmen. In addition, there are many enemy planes that did not return to their original defenses or crashed and were damaged when returning to their defenses. The Foreign Secretary then expressed his warm admiration for Prime Minister Metaxas and the Greek army, and also mentioned Turkey, saying that the ties between Britain and Turkey are strong and unbreakable. Our confidence in Turkey is the same as Turkey's confidence in Britain. As for the British-Egyptian relationship, it is also close and harmonious, and the Egyptian government has fulfilled its treaty obligations. (Reuters, 6th)</p>

<p>Chongqing: According to diplomatic sources, Chairman Lin of the National Government sent a special telegram to Chairman Kalinin of the Soviet Union this year to celebrate the Soviet National Day. The text reads: "To His Excellency Kalinin, Chairman of the Supreme Soviet of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics in Moscow, on the occasion of the 23rd anniversary of the great October Revolution in your country, I would like to express my sincere congratulations on behalf of the people of our country, and wish your country prosperity." (6th)</p>
<p>Moscow: Regarding the 13th anniversary of the Great Socialist October Revolution, the "Pravda" commented, "Tomorrow is the 23rd anniversary of the Great Socialist October Revolution. All cities and factories will celebrate together. Countless Soviet people will express their love for their motherland and their loyalty to Leninism-Stalinism. The past year has been a year of construction in the Soviet Union, but disputes have arisen in the capitalist world. The Second Imperialist War is currently expanding, and new countries and peoples are being drawn into the war. The Soviet Union continues its policy of peace and has never participated in the war. Stalin's foresight has completely revealed the conspiracies of our enemies. Stalin's wise policies have further enhanced the security of our motherland. In the past few years, the Soviet Union has further strengthened its border defenses, especially national defense in the Northwest. In the past year, the Soviet Union has become a federation of sixteen republics. Soviet power has been established in the three Baltic countries, and the people of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina have also been liberated from oppression. In short, the Soviet Union has become a strong country, and its power in international politics has also increased. All these achievements have aroused the hatred of the enemy. They have not yet abandoned their conspiracy to undermine the Soviet Union's peaceful construction and drag us into the war. Countless Soviet people are committed to strengthening our country's national defense and economic strength, so as to protect the continued development of culture and science. The Communist Party government and Stalin are paying attention to the training of the army. Under Stalin's efforts, there have been major changes in the training methods of the Red Army. The recent Red Army and Navy exercises have demonstrated the achievements in this area." (TASS, 6th)</p>

<p>London: Prime Minister Churchill reported on the war amid frequent cheers in the House of Commons last night. First, he spoke about the war in the British sky, saying:</p>
<h3 id="e38">Air Force Loss Ratio <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>Two months ago, I said that the ratio of enemy planes lost to British planes lost was three to one, and the ratio of pilots lost was six to one. To this day, in terms of total time, what I said about the ratio of planes lost can be said to be correct. As for the ratio of pilots lost, what I said is also not much different. Judging from the loss of well-trained bomber crew members by the enemy, the enemy's loss of strength is ten times that of ours. Therefore, judging from the results we have obtained, my previous estimates were still too low. Since the enemy has lost so much, and our production of planes and crew members, including British territory and the United States, has increased so rapidly, this is indeed the quickest way to obtain the air superiority necessary for our security and to achieve final victory. (Cheers) Looking at the overall war situation, in the glory and suffering of the war, I have not seen any reason why Hitler can destroy the spirit of the British people by means of bombing our suburbs.</p>
<h3 id="e39">Heavy Naval Task <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>There is something more serious than air raids, which is the recent resurgence of German submarines at the entrance to the Atlantic Ocean outside Ireland. We cannot use the southwest coast of Ireland to protect the trade that supports the lives of Ireland and Britain. This fact is a heavy burden on our shoulders that we should not have. In the past month, the strength of the British fleet on patrol has been very weak, because we have to deal with the threat of invading England, maintain a strong fleet in the Mediterranean, and provide full protection for countless merchant ships. The work that our navy has undertaken is so huge, but this period of tension is gradually passing. Fifty American destroyers have quickly joined the team at the time when we need them most, and new ships that were already under construction at the beginning of the war are now being completed one after another. Although the tonnage of our country's merchant ships has lost a lot, it has not decreased compared with the beginning of the war, and most of the neutral ships that have always traded freely with us are now under our control. Our army's search for enemy submarines is still very effective. In the past two or three days, two German submarines were destroyed again in the western sea, and many of their crew members were captured. One of them was the submarine that sank the British Queen. (Cheers)</p>
<h3 id="e40">Maintain Maritime Traffic <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>I am confident that the British shipping industry will be able to transport all the necessary food and munitions needed by Britain, but it is expected that submarine attacks next year will be more severe than this year. But we are now prepared. We must be far-sighted in this aspect of the war. We must take into account the merchant ship procedures in 1943 and 1944, so that if the enemy has not surrendered or collapsed by then, we can still maintain maritime traffic. I can tell the House with certainty that we will definitely protect the stability of our mainland. This is my personal opinion without any doubt. (Cheers)</p>
<h3 id="e41">Strengthening the Army <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>The British Prime Minister, in speaking about the army, said that the British army is now strong and highly mobile. The failure of the German invasion of Britain is a victory in the history of the central island and a milestone for the British counter-offensive. Britain is still engaged in organizing and training a strong army, and Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, and India are also committed to this. If there is no well-trained and great army, the war situation will be protracted or become a stalemate. Even when the threat of a German invasion was imminent, Britain continued to send troops and war materials to Egypt to reinforce, as far as the shipping and transportation capacity allowed. Every month, tens of thousands of soldiers, either from the British Isles or elsewhere in the British Empire, were sent to the Middle East. The strength of the troops on the Egyptian border and in Sudan is now far from as weak as it was when France collapsed. This is what I can assure the House of Commons. The authority of the British fleet in the eastern Mediterranean is gradually restoring the situation caused by the collapse of France, and guaranteeing Turkey that British naval power has not weakened in the slightest. Therefore, the House of Commons should not deny that our current situation, whether on the domestic front or the Mediterranean battlefield, is far better than what the world expected four or five months ago.</p>

<p>Now we suddenly encounter a new summons. The Italian dictator, probably annoyed by Laval's flattery of Germany, or with other new plans, is using his usual cold-blooded methods to increase his oppression of the small and unfeeling nation of Greece. Mussolini, without encountering any provocative acts or using the facade of negotiation, has sent troops to Greece, and his planes have massacred Greek civilians in Thessaloniki and other places. The Greek government and people are determined to fight for life and honor. We have carefully avoided any actions that could make Greece an enemy, and Greece has maintained strict neutrality, but Greece has not escaped. Although we are currently occupied with matters at home and in the Middle East, in this environment, there is only one thing we can do: that is, we will do our best. (Cheers) We have now established naval and air force bases on Crete. (Continued cheers) We can now expand the scope of our naval and air force activities. We have begun to attack military targets and bases in southern Italian cities. This kind of war will continue on a larger scale. I would like to tell you that other troops are being mobilized for the purpose of actively assisting Greece. However, I hope the House of Commons will not inquire about the details of the aid to Greece plan. If I say too much, it will raise false hopes. If I don't say enough, it will cause unnecessary panic. If I tell the truth, it will reveal what the enemy wants to know. In short, all I can say is that we will do our best. I am sure the House of Commons will agree with this statement. (Reuters, 6th)</p>

<p>Petition from People of Ji County, Requesting Posthumous Commendation for Geng Mingyuan for His Righteous Sacrifice</p>
<p>Ji County News. Geng Mingyuan, a respected elder of Ji County, was a man of high moral character, fond of doing good deeds, and courageous in defending righteousness. He was deeply loved by the people. Since the county fell into enemy hands in September of the 27th year (1938), he endured hardships and dedicated himself to the country and the people. This time, the Japanese army, dissatisfied with the actions of a certain village in the county, intended to burn it to the ground. For the sake of the lives and property of thousands of fellow countrymen, he stepped forward to plead for the people, hoping to preserve them. As a result, he sacrificed his own life to save the entire village from disaster. His spirit of sacrificing himself for righteousness is truly admirable. It is said that the people of the county have erected a monument in his memory and jointly petitioned the National Government for a posthumous commendation.</p>

<h3 id="e44">President Roosevelt's Family History <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>Roosevelt was elected for the third time yesterday, and his re-election as President of the United States is truly an auspicious sign unprecedented in American history. Speaking superstitiously, although it is due to his own good fortune and successful old age, it is not entirely unrelated to the merits accumulated by his ancestors and the good fortune of his birth chart! Just a joke.</p>
<p>If we were to imitate biographical writing, the opening sentences should perhaps say: "Roosevelt, whose ancestors were Dutch farmers, the lineage of which is long and difficult to trace. In the 17th century, his great-great-grandfather moved from the village of Roosevelt to New Amsterdam. Because there was no family name, he took the village name as his surname..."</p>
<p>In fact, from President Roosevelt's great-grandfather onwards, genealogical records are clearly documented. To say that the deeds of his ancestors are lost is only because the era is long and there are no records to be found.</p>
<p>Now, let's start with the two generations before Roosevelt's grandfather: Isaac Roosevelt, born in 1726, was the great-grandfather of the current President of the United States, Franklin Roosevelt. He started his business in the industrial sector, founded New York's first sugar factory, refined sugar and made sweet wine, accumulating considerable wealth. Because he had a great position in the business world, he was also the president of New York's first bank, "Bank of New York." In addition to business, he also engaged in a political career, serving as a member of the New York State Assembly.</p>
<p>His son James, President Roosevelt's great-grandfather, not only benefited from his ancestors' legacy but also excelled at manipulating oddities and seeking profit, leaving no stone unturned in his pursuit of land and property. He once owned 400 acres of farmland on Manhattan Island in New York, which is now the most magnificent Fifth Avenue to the East River in New York City. He also, like his father, worked as a New York banker.</p>
<p>Roosevelt's grandfather, also named Isaac, initially studied medicine. Because he was too compassionate, he kept moving his family, eventually settling down in Hyde Park near the Hudson River. Because he did not engage in production, his family's wealth was far less than that of his father and grandfather. Fortunately, good people have good sons. President Roosevelt's father, also named James, was shrewd and capable, and restored the family's reputation. He was the "lord" of the Roosevelt family's revival.</p>
<p>He was devoted to Mountainism and was an advanced member of the Democratic Party. The son of a great family, President Roosevelt can be said to be able to carry on the ambitions of his predecessors. In business, he was also a resourceful and skilled merchant. He invested his wealth in the railway industry and also served as an executive in the Delaware and Hudson Railway Company. Because his family was wealthy, his life was rich and comfortable. He always traveled to Europe every year for leisure and recreation. He loved all kinds of sports competitions, especially horse racing. He built a new residence several miles away from the old residence in Hyde Park, spending his leisurely years and passing away in 1900.</p>
<p>James married twice. His first wife, Rebecca Howland, was the daughter of a wealthy New York merchant. Her father made a fortune trading with China and had one son, nicknamed "Rosey," who was President Roosevelt's brother. His second wife was Sarah Delano, President Roosevelt's mother. In 1880, she met James at a banquet for Theodore Roosevelt. They fell in love at first sight and soon got married. At that time, Sarah was 26 years old and James was 52 years old. Two years later, President Roosevelt was born.</p>
<p>President Roosevelt's mother is now 85 years old and still very energetic. Her father, President Roosevelt's maternal grandfather, Warren Delano, lost his fortune accumulated through trade with China in the 1857 economic crisis and returned to Hong Kong to resume his old business. He took his entire family, old and young, on a long sea voyage. In addition to the couple, seven children, both boys and girls, took the "Surprise" clipper ship, rounding the Cape of Good Hope to China, and arrived at their destination after 125 days at sea. President Roosevelt's mother was quite famous for her beauty in her youth. After marrying James, the old husband and young wife enjoyed the happiness of harmony. When President Roosevelt was born, it was an extraordinary addition of splendor, and the couple loved him like a treasure, never letting him out of their sight before the age of fourteen.</p>
<p>"Rosey" Roosevelt, President Roosevelt's older brother, was a natural-born pleasure-seeker. He married Helen Astor, the daughter of a millionaire. "Rosey" was truly fond of the pleasures of the flesh. He was a typical gentleman of elegance and luxury at that time. Unfortunately, his first wife died early, and he remarried Elizabeth Riley, a beautiful woman from England. She now lives near Hyde Park and often visits the Roosevelts because they live so close. "Rosey" had one son and one daughter. The daughter, Helen, married Robison. The son, James Roosevelt, inherited his mother's Astor family fortune and has an uncle who is the President. He now lives in seclusion in "Kew Gardens" in New York. He is most enthusiastic about the Salvation Army's work.</p>
<p>President Roosevelt was born into a wealthy family and was loved by his parents since childhood, so he naturally enjoyed everything, which cannot be compared with the children of scholarly families. As for education, that was even less of a problem. In 1905, he married Eleanor Roosevelt, and the couple were very compatible. The First Lady studied in England in her early years and was very talented. After marrying Roosevelt, she took care of her husband and children and became a typical American housewife. However, her appearance was quite ordinary. When she was a child, her mother told her to study hard so that she could become a virtuous wife and good mother in the future. She knew that if she relied solely on her appearance, she might not find a suitable husband.</p>
<p>President Roosevelt's mother-in-law was a very beautiful lady. In New York society, besides Mrs. Astor, who was famous for her beauty, she was the second most beautiful woman. Her photograph was cherished by aesthetic experts who loved to collect portraits of beautiful women. President Roosevelt's father-in-law, Edward Roosevelt, was originally an athlete who loved hunting, but unfortunately, he was addicted to alcohol and was not very successful in his later years. He passed away in 1894. His brother, President Roosevelt's uncle-in-law, Theodore Roosevelt, was very prestigious in politics. He served as the 26th President of the United States.</p>
<p>When President Roosevelt was five years old, he was taken to the White House by his parents and met with the then President Cleveland. President Cleveland said to Roosevelt, "Young man, I suddenly have a strange idea... I hope you will never be President in your life." Who knew that this young man would now be President for the third time in a row? If Cleveland knew in the afterlife, he would laugh in astonishment.</p>

<h3 id="e45">Roosevelt's Election Victory: Shanghai Business Community Overjoyed, Believing Aid to China Will Become More Active, Maintaining Consistent Policy of Resisting Violence, American Community Watched Voting Developments All Day Yesterday <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>The US election that has attracted worldwide attention has been announced yesterday, and it has been revealed that Mr. Roosevelt will continue to serve as the next US President. As a result, foreign nationals of democratic countries and the Chinese side in this city have expressed enthusiastic satisfaction and congratulated Mr. Roosevelt unanimously. It is believed that during his re-election term, whether in the Far East or in Europe, he will adopt a strong policy against aggression and safeguard the rights of the United States. It is deeply believed that Mr. Roosevelt will be able to provide China with greater assistance in the future. It is recalled that on the 26th of last month, Hull made a statement to the American national newspapers, acknowledging that the armed aggression of the totalitarian countries has shown that the United States can no longer superstitiously believe in its own unreliable security and the untrustworthy promises of dictators. Only by continuing to more actively assist China and the United Kingdom can it seek self-defense and survival. This is a promise from the United States to all countries that love justice, peace, and freedom in the world. After Mr. Roosevelt's quick appointment, there is no doubt that he will put it into practice.</p>
<p>Great Comfort to Chinese and Foreigners</p>
<p>Since the news of Roosevelt's election victory arrived in Shanghai last night, the attitude of the majority of Chinese and foreign residents in this port has been one of joy. The American community was telling each other, "I told you so!" Few businessmen went to the office yesterday afternoon, and most of them gathered in hotels, clubs, and bars to talk about the results of this election. At the same time, foreign telegrams and wireless telegraphs continuously reported the progress of the US voting to this port, attracting great attention from Chinese and foreign people. It was also heard that there were three people in the office of the US Bailiff's Office in this port, who were local lawyers, clerks, and enforcement officers. Their positions were closely related to the results of yesterday's election. If Mr. Roosevelt had been defeated, they would have advanced and retreated with him. According to US Bailiff Hamilick, it was the right decision for the American people to elect Roosevelt to be re-elected in these turbulent times. The famous American lawyer Fankeling declared yesterday that he had long expected Roosevelt to win and had repeatedly made this prediction to people. Another American lawyer, Aleman, said that the American citizens' voting was very wise. Roosevelt's policy is to protect the interests of the United States in the Far East. He is convinced that this policy will continue to be implemented.</p>
<p>Far East Policy Will Become Stronger</p>
<p>According to an observer on the Chinese side, President Roosevelt's re-election is of great importance to China, because President Roosevelt has always advocated aiding China and restraining Japan. His policy has become more active in recent months. Now that he has been re-elected, it means that his policy has won the enthusiastic support of an absolute majority of the American people, so he can now fully implement his ideas. It can be seen that the US Far East policy will become more active and firm. Although Mr. Wilkie has also stated that if he is elected, he will also assist China, the Republican Party has a strong tendency to isolationism, and whether Mr. Wilkie's promise can be realized is questionable. Even if it can be implemented, it is not as thorough as Roosevelt, who is deeply aware of the situation in the Far East. Because Mr. Roosevelt has realized from his many years of experience that unless the policy of appeasement in the Far East is terminated and China is actively assisted, the interests of the United States in the Far East cannot be protected. For himself and for others, he cannot but provide greater assistance to China. Moreover, Mr. Roosevelt has been in power for eight years, and he can handle everything with ease. At this time of treacherous world affairs, he can especially cope with it comfortably. Therefore, the American people, in order to maintain their consistent national policy and deal with violence, have this result. It is expected that the relationship between China and the United States will become closer in the future, and the actions of the United States in the Far East will also become stronger.</p>
<p>American Community in This City Extremely Concerned</p>
<p>According to the English "Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury," the American community in this city is extremely interested in the presidential election of their country, which has not happened in previous elections. Yesterday morning, the first news about the voting arrived in Shanghai, stating that according to informal statistics, President Roosevelt was slightly ahead of his political enemy Wilkie in fourteen states. The American community in this city had different views on this result. Those who supported Wilkie expressed satisfaction with this obvious fact, saying that President Roosevelt would not get twice the unexpected number of votes as he did in the 1936 election. As a result, those who supported Roosevelt felt that Roosevelt's election was not very certain. Later, at ten o'clock yesterday morning, the second news arrived in Shanghai, stating that Roosevelt had gained an advantage in twenty-seven states in the United States and would defeat Wilkie with 65 electoral votes. Those who supported Roosevelt were greatly encouraged. From the attitudes of people from all walks of life in Shanghai, it was clear that those who sympathized with Roosevelt were in the absolute majority. Before 11:00 a.m. yesterday morning, those who supported Wilkie received news that according to informal statistics, Roosevelt had 187 electoral votes, while Wilkie had 141. Roosevelt had an advantage in eighteen states, while Wilkie also had an advantage in twelve states. The two sides were evenly matched, and there was not much difference. Wilkie could have a chance to win. After 11:00 a.m., when the news was received here that Roosevelt could get 219 electoral votes, while his political enemy could only get 88 electoral votes, and that the Democratic Party had an advantage in 19 of the 28 states, it was felt that Wilkie had no hope of being elected.</p>
<p>Mock Voting: Roosevelt Wins</p>
<p>The General Federation of American Women in this city held a mock presidential election at the clubhouse on the afternoon of the 5th (the previous day). As a result, Roosevelt won a great victory, with 40 votes, while Wilkie only got 20 votes. In her 20-minute speech, Mrs. Parsons, a supporter of Roosevelt, enumerated the benefits of Roosevelt's rule, especially paying attention to how the "New Deal" created relief organizations and established unemployment insurance and pensions. Mrs. Parsons said that Roosevelt's government has always been concerned with the greatest interests of the greatest number of people. Mr. Roosevelt's foreign policy is characterized by advocating world peace, supplemented by aid to democratic countries except for participation in the war. At the same time, he has unified the countries of South America. Mrs. Parsons continued to say that the biggest difference between Roosevelt and Wilkie is that Wilkie lacks experience, because Wilkie has never held office, while Roosevelt has been a successful leader in the past eight years. Mrs. Sheliff passionately defended Wilkie and pointed out the shortcomings of Roosevelt. Finally, the women in the audience voted to resolve the matter. Several British women were also present as observers at that time.</p>
<p>British Expatriates Warmly Welcome</p>
<p>After obtaining Roosevelt's victory, the Pingming News reporter first inquired about the opinions of the British official in Shanghai, but he said that he did not want to express his opinion in his position. However, the authoritative figures of the British community in this port expressed a warm welcome to President Roosevelt's election victory. The reason is that with the European war in full swing, Roosevelt's continued election victory will make the relationship between Britain and the United States closer and will be realized quickly. The reason is that Roosevelt has repeatedly clarified his attitude, maintaining the status quo and peace of the world, and opposing the aggressive behavior of the Axis powers.</p>
<h3 id="e46">Soviet Revolution Anniversary Celebrations to be Held for Five Days Starting Today <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>Today is the 23rd anniversary of the Soviet October Revolution. Soviet expatriates here will hold a dance party at the American Women's Federation on Jing'an Temple Road for five days. This grand event was initiated by the Shanghai Soviet Expatriate Federation and invited Latvian, Lithuanian, and Estonian expatriates to participate in the celebration together. However, Soviet diplomats have already left, so there will be no diplomatic reception ceremony. The dance party will be held from 9:00 p.m. today and will feature the screening of the Soviet film "Great Award" and the 1918 Lenin film. The Soviet Expatriate Association also invited White Russians in this city to participate, but the White Russians will go to the White Russian church today to pray in mourning. The October Revolution is also the anniversary of the establishment of the Soviet government, the Bolshevik Revolution.</p>

<h3 id="e47">Plague Discovered in Ningbo, Confirmed by Laboratory Tests, Over Twenty Deaths, Shanghai and Ningbo are Closely Connected, Worthy of Great Attention <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>Recently, a plague has suddenly been discovered in Ningbo, and the situation is very serious. Plague is a statutory infectious disease with the most severe epidemic nature. All countries in the world regard this disease as a flood and fierce beast. Shanghai and Ningbo are closely connected and deserve great attention. The Datong News reporter has recorded the details as follows:</p>
<p>Plague Discovered</p>
<p>According to Datong News reporter's investigation, the plague in Ningbo was discovered on the 30th of last month, and the area is in the Donghou Street area of Kaiming Bridge in the city. More than 20 people have died one after another. After the local government agencies discovered it, they immediately sealed off the traffic in that section to isolate it. At the same time, a temporary isolation hospital and an epidemic prevention office were set up. All houses in the epidemic area were fumigated to eradicate rat fleas.</p>
<p>Laboratory Test Confirmed</p>
<p>All theaters in the Ningbo urban area have also stopped performing to prevent those infected from mixing in and spreading the epidemic. At the same time, the provincial government was requested to send a health team to Ningbo to assist in the suppression. The blood of the infected has been tested by the Ningbo Huamei Hospital. The blood vessels were injected into the abdomen of a Dutch rat. As a result, the rat died in less than 24 hours. Therefore, there is no doubt that it is a real plague.</p>
<p>Traffic Blockaded</p>
<p>The Yin County government issued a special announcement saying that since the 30th of last month, a plague has been discovered in Kaiming Street in Dongzhen, Tangda Town, and Donghou Street in this county, and the spread is very serious. In three days, nearly 20 people have died without treatment. The plague area is located in a bustling area. If it is not suppressed as soon as possible, it will be irreversible. Now, together with the Ningbo Police Department, the following areas are designated as the sealed-off and implemented prevention areas. No entry or exit is allowed in the epidemic area. It is related to the epidemic policy. I hope all people will strictly abide by it. Plague sealed-off areas: (1) Zhongshan East Road - Kaiming Street to Tai Niu Alley; (2) Kaiming Street - Zhongshan East Road to Guandi Alley; (3) Taiping Alley - Zhongshan East Road to Donghou Street.</p>
<h3 id="e48">Venerable Rongzeng Bestows Two Initiations, Today Burns Offerings for Protection, Will Enter Seclusion to Practice Dharma After the Ceremony <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>The bronze statue opening ceremony of the Panchen Lama, held by Venerable Rongzeng, originally scheduled for eighteen days of thousand-lamp offerings, was extended for two days due to numerous requests, which were difficult to refuse, and will conclude today. In the past two days, Venerable Rongzeng bestowed the initiation of the longevity Dharma and the four-armed Guanyin Dharma. According to Tantric Buddhist custom, those who receive the initiation should make offerings to the initiating Dharma master. Venerable Rongzeng deeply embodies compassion, selflessness, and equality, and does not accept offerings, uniformly performing green liquid initiations. The attendance was unprecedentedly large. Today's burning offerings for protection is an even grander ceremony. This was held once in Shanghai last year during the Great White Umbrella Benefit Dharma Assembly and is not often encountered, so those who go to watch the ceremony today will be even more crowded. Venerable Rongzeng plans to enter a long-term retreat after this Dharma assembly to practice the great Dharma and to recuperate. In the future, he will still focus on promoting Buddhism, expounding Tibetan Tantra, and translating scriptures. As for the bronze statue expenses, they all come from the Venerable's usual accumulated offerings, but if believers donate on their own, there is Mr. Wang from Beiping donating 1,000 yuan, and Mr. Tang donating 100 yuan.</p>

<p>The US government has advised its citizens in the Far East to return home. The first group of American citizens evacuated from this city departed from Shanghai the day before yesterday (the 4th) morning aboard the government-designated special ship, the "Mount Vernon." Additionally, the President Coolidge, a postal ship of the American President Lines, returned from Little Luzon, passing through Hong Kong to Shanghai on its way back to the United States. It arrived in port on Tuesday (the 5th) afternoon, docking at buoys 11 and 12. It is reported that there were as many as 629 passengers on board returning to the US from Luzon and Hong Kong. The above information has been reported in previous newspapers. It is now known that the ship is scheduled to set sail this morning at 4:00 AM, again passing through Kobe, Yokohama, Honolulu, and San Francisco before returning to Los Angeles. There are also 212 passengers from this city returning to their home country on this ship. In total, there are about 850 passengers returning from the Far East. It is reported that Mrs. Hepburn, wife of Admiral Hepburn, Commander-in-Chief of the US Naval Asiatic Fleet, and her daughter are also returning home on this ship. Therefore, most of them are evacuated citizens. The second special ship, the Mariposa, is on its way to Shanghai. There is no definite information on the date and time of its arrival in Shanghai, but the date of its return to the US has been set for this Sunday (the 10th).</p>
<h3 id="e50">Winter Approaching: Charities Solicit Donations <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>Women and Children's Association: The fundraising committee of the China Women and Children's Relief Association yesterday issued a public notice, stating, "The China Women and Children's Relief Association was founded in the third year of Xuantong (1911), and has been dedicated to rescuing lost and abducted women and children for nearly thirty years, numbering over ten thousand people. However, our association has always lacked funds, struggling to maintain its operations year after year. The January 28th Incident almost brought it to a halt. Unexpectedly, the war has started again. The Jiangwan Nursing Home of our association was directly affected, and the buildings and movable property were all destroyed. Since relocating to Shanghai, work has continued as usual, with the number of women and children in care increasing rather than decreasing. At a time when everything is expensive, there is not enough clothing or food, and the situation is extremely difficult. We have always admired those who are enthusiastic about charity and have a spirit of universal love. Therefore, we are respectfully presenting donation forms, earnestly requesting generous donations or promoting fundraising to support this good cause together. Please send donations to No. 422, Xingye Building, Jiangxi Road, Beijing Road, telephone 14303, so that this only national women and children's relief organization can last forever, which would truly be a great merit."</p>
<p>Scrap Cloth Guild: The Shanghai Scrap Cloth Trade Association yesterday convened a meeting of all member representatives to discuss fundraising for winter clothing. The meeting was first addressed by Chairman Wang Wenhan, who explained the purpose of soliciting donations for winter clothing. Executive Committee member Deng Deqing then distributed signature forms to each representative for donation pledges. A sum of one thousand yuan was raised on the spot. Members unable to attend, numbering over fifty, will be approached individually by designated personnel to solicit donations.</p>
<p>Chinese Women's Association: The Chinese Women's Association's relief group, in view of the large number of refugees in Shanghai and the increasingly cold weather, with many refugees lacking adequate clothing, has issued lottery tickets. A total of 3,000 lottery tickets have been issued, each selling for two yuan in national currency. The first prize is a twelve-lamp floor-standing wireless radio from a famous American manufacturer, which is quite valuable and is currently displayed in the window of Wing On Company. The second and third prizes are also valuable items. All proceeds from the lottery will be used for refugee winter clothing expenses. In addition to sales by members, the Wing On Company gift certificate department is also selling the lottery tickets. It is reported that all the tickets will be sold out soon, so the public should purchase them as soon as possible and not miss the opportunity. It is also reported that the lottery will be drawn publicly at the association's office at 2:00 PM on November 11th, regardless of whether all tickets are sold out, and will not be postponed.</p>

<p>Wang Zhang Zaihua, a wealthy widow from Pudong, had a husband, the late Wang Yonglin, whose first wife, Xie, had a son named Mingji, who died long ago, leaving behind one son and one daughter: a son named Jingren and a daughter named Ningwa. Yonglin's concubine, Cheng, had a son and a daughter: a son named Yizhi and a daughter named Zhengan, who is married with the surname Gu. Zhang was Yonglin's second wife, and although she had no children of her own, the couple had a good relationship. Therefore, Zhang possessed a considerable amount of private property. After Yonglin died of illness last year, Zhang managed the estate, worth 500,000 yuan. Later, when Zhang died of illness, the entire estate of Yonglin and Zhang was divided among Wang Yizhi, Wang Jingren, and others. Zhang's elder sister, Zhang Zaihe (70 years old this year), recently appointed lawyer Huang Qingyuan to file a lawsuit with the First Special Court's Civil Division, in accordance with Article 1138, Paragraph 2 of the Civil Code, against Wang Yizhi, Wang Jingren, Wang Ningwa, Wang Zhengan, and others, requesting confirmation that Wang Zhang's exclusive property, worth nearly 100,000 yuan, should be inherited solely by the plaintiff. It was argued that Wang Zhang had no blood relatives, and only the plaintiff and Wang Zhang were sisters, and should be allowed to inherit according to the law. At the same time, Zhang Zaihe also demanded to analyze one-quarter of Wang Yonglin's entire estate. After the court received the lawsuit, Judge Tao summoned the case for trial. The defendant Wang Yizhi's attorney requested an out-of-court settlement, and the court ordered a postponement of the trial. On the date set for the trial yesterday, there was a major complication. Wang Wu Fengli (22 years old, from Shanghai, residing at No. 2, Yude Lane, Xicang Road, Nanshi), the wife of the defendant Wang Jingren, submitted a statement to the First Special Court the day before yesterday, stating:</p>
<p>"The defendant Wang Jingren is the petitioner's husband. Wang Jingren was summoned for trial in this case on the morning of the 6th of this month. For his own benefit, he should have appeared in court himself or appointed an attorney to respond to the lawsuit. Unexpectedly, on the morning of October 26th of this year, Wang Jingren was arrested in Nanshi while carrying documents and pleadings related to various cases, preparing to leave home to submit them. He was arrested on the grounds that Wang Jingren had embezzled part of the estate of Wang Yonglin and his wife. He was detained and forbidden from communicating with others, making it difficult for Wang Jingren to answer questions and submit documents. Moreover, he has not appointed lawyer Gao Danhua to represent him," etc. After receiving the statement, Judge Tao continued to preside over the trial of the case yesterday. Huang Jiyuan, the attorney for the plaintiff Sheng Zhang Zaihe, requested that this case and Wang Zhengan's estate dispute case be consolidated for trial. The court discussed and waited for verification. Wang Yizhi's appointed attorney, Xi Yuchang, and others appeared in court. Shen Xingxia, the attorney for Wang Ningwa, also arrived. Xi Yuchang and others raised objections to the plaintiff's identity. The two parties debated for a long time. The court discussed and adjourned the trial to the 27th of this month.</p>

<p>Shen Tongchang, from Pinghu, 31 years old, worked as a manager at the Sanfeng Grain Store at No. 9, Lane 274, Route Cardinal Foch, earning a monthly salary of 110 yuan. Since his employment, he had been loyal to his duties. However, his attitude suddenly changed recently. In mid-July of this year, he used 6,500 yuan of store funds to purchase broad beans in Pinghu. After selling them a few days later, he made a profit of over 2,000 yuan. Subsequently, on August 30, he sold 140 bags of Siamese rice to the Shen Huichang store at a low price and also gave 1,300 burlap sacks to Mr. Shen. This situation was considered a breach of trust. Shareholder representative Wu Liangren reported the information to the French police, who arrested Shen and sent him to the Second Criminal Division of the Second Special Court. Police lawyer Fei Xizhen prosecuted him for breach of trust under Article 242. According to the defendant's confession, the plaintiff's accusation was a misunderstanding. Therefore, a civil lawsuit was attached, and the two parties have reached a settlement and appointed lawyer Zhu Yongkang to defend him. After verifying the statements in court, the hearing was adjourned to the 15th. The defendant was detained.</p>

<p>In the Silver Coin Cup Table Tennis Tournament, Tzu Kang faced off against Shanghai at the China Travel Service recreation room at 7 PM the night before last. The two teams were evenly matched in strength. Although Tzu Kang had the famous player Chuan Chi-fang assisting, the overall talent of the team seemed not as well-rounded as Shanghai's. Therefore, a fierce battle was inevitable. Unexpectedly, during the competition, Shanghai performed poorly, repeatedly missing opportunities to win. Tzu Kang, on the other hand, displayed its full potential. As a result, Tzu Kang lightly defeated Shanghai with a score of thirteen to four, exceeding expectations.

<h3 id="e74">Food: Rice Merchants Cleverly Employ Propaganda to Secure Thousands of Tons of Foreign Rice; Insufficient Shipping Capacity Reveals its Role <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>Recently, there has been another large-scale propaganda campaign in the rice market, designed to mislead people and alleviate the responsibility of rice merchants and outside speculators who hoard and manipulate the market, harming the people's food supply. The intent is extremely sinister. Despite calls for people to buy rice in advance and form group purchases, there is no consideration of how to "group" or how to "purchase." If only companies and firms are considered as group units, how many companies and firms can actually undertake group rice purchases for their employees? Even if companies and firms can all do this, how can the majority of food consumers who are not in companies and firms "group" together? This kind of action only makes the public feel confused and gives rice merchants and speculators the opportunity to raise prices and manipulate the market. They may think they are taking precautions, but they are actually obstructing the people's food supply. Recently, there have also been widespread rumors of insufficient shipping capacity, but according to this newspaper's investigation, arrivals from the source have been continuous in recent days, and there are still many goods on the way. All of this is because a group of powerful speculators in Shanghai, still not satisfied with their fortunes, are willing to use all kinds of means to create pretexts for manipulating the people's food supply. Otherwise, why would it be like this? Yesterday morning, the foreign rice market rose again due to this. The reason was simply that the previous day's price increase and the scarcity of domestic rice attracted inquiries from shopkeepers, rural customers, and speculators. The market then rose by about one yuan. However, the reality is that there are large deals for foreign rice that have been agreed upon. In addition to those being loaded immediately, there are also futures contracts for November and December. It is said that the total amount is six or seven thousand tons, ordered by Jian Yuan, Shen Ji, He Yi, Jin Fa, and others. Immediately loaded No. 1 Saigon rice is priced at 76-77 yuan, No. 2 rice at 71.5-71 yuan, November at 71 yuan, and December at 70-69.9 yuan. It is also rumored that No. 1 Saigon rice for December was once ordered at a low price of 72 yuan, which shows that the claim of insufficient shipping capacity is fabricated by speculators. As a result, people became nervous, and the market quickly collapsed, falling by about two yuan before the afternoon close, resulting in a price even lower than the previous night by a small amount. Spot price of No. 2 Yinghua Si that was returned was quoted at 74 yuan, down to 73 yuan, also down by 1.5 yuan from the previous night. In the afternoon, the market was weak, and the market remained soft.</p>
<p>New Gengjian and Luzhong rice, due to rain, arrived in small quantities, only four or five hundred dan. However, the market happened to be during the surge of foreign rice, and people were firmly bullish, all seeking to purchase them. The sales were exceptionally fast, resulting in a temporary shortage, and they became rare commodities. The prices of various types of rice rose sharply by one or two yuan. New Geng special original bags were priced at 85 yuan, followed by 81 yuan, bulk was 79 yuan, followed by 77 yuan. Tea seeds were 79 yuan, 77.5 yuan. Wild rice was scarce and had no market. Dujian original bags were 71 yuan, and Nangang bulk rice broke 80 yuan early. Glutinous rice, due to inactivity of wine merchants, only relied on scattered demand, so prices remained unchanged.</p>
<h3 id="e75">Flour Remains Quiet <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>Flour: Yesterday's spot flour market remained quiet. Factory prices remained at 17 yuan, and customer prices were 18 yuan. There was no market for returned goods, so there were few transactions on the exchange. Foreign flour sales were also slow. Although Paotai brand foreign flour was quoted at 19 yuan, there were no formal deals. The overall market, apart from Huachang selling 8,000-9,000 bags, heard that 150 bags of No. 4 Fenghong Taohua brand were purchased from this street at a price of 15.8 yuan. There were also 15,000 bags of flour shipped to Fujian today (7th).</p>
<p>Wheat: Yesterday's wheat market was stagnant as usual. Because production prices were high and transportation was difficult, there was a long-term shortage of arrivals. Daily arrivals from the suburbs were all purchased by Japanese factories at the original price of 21 yuan. Chinese factories, due to the difficulty of transporting into the concessions, have not been interested for a long time. The market had little activity, with no regular trading.</p>
<h3 id="e76">Finance: Japanese Merchants Eagerly Sell US Dollars <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>Foreign Exchange: Yesterday's market saw no changes in HSBC's listed rates. The black market for British and American dollars remained calm. However, some people believed that selling was beneficial because Roosevelt had won more votes. In the early morning, the market was slightly tight due to the absorption by Chinese merchants, and Japanese banks sold some spot US dollars, which then hardened the market. Added to the above situation, it was like the Wusong River before closing. The closing price for British gold was 3 pounds, 9 shillings, 3.75 pence, and the US dollar was 6.09375 yuan, up 0.015625 and 0.03125 compared to the previous day's closing.

<h3 id="e81">Securities: Domestic Debt Slightly Fluctuates <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>The off-exchange market for securities stabilized somewhat yesterday. Most of the floating shorts have been covered, and the actual goods are flowing out. At this time, there is no need to cover the market price. Observing yesterday's situation, the floating longs are looking for ways to exit, but they dare not sell off boldly to prevent the market price from being suppressed. There is an appearance of slowly selling off. Tong Kang's long positions are still interested. Most of Xin Fu's long positions have been sold off, and retail investors are still holding on. The trend may change slightly because each group cannot short sell (because there are no goods available). The news environment is largely favorable, with more positive news than negative news. However, there are many waves in the future, and one should not be too optimistic. There was limited trading in the morning, and more trading in the afternoon. Tong Kang consistently bought in. Others, such as Lian He, Ding Kang, Bao Chang, and Da Tong, also absorbed large amounts, especially retail investors buying in small amounts. Hong Da and Xin Fu's long positions have gradually emerged. In the afternoon, Lian He switched to selling. Xie Kang, Yong Kang, Dun Yu, Jian Li, and Mao Tai either closed their long positions or released actual goods, so the market price rose slightly and then fell. As a result, there were more declines than increases, with the amount being only one or two cents. The amount of trading was over 2 million yuan. A simplified table is listed below:</p>
<p>Stock Trading: Ninety shares of Chunghwa Book Company were traded at a price of 33.25 yuan.</p>
<p>Also, in the public exchanges, the public concentrated on the results of the US presidential election and had little interest in the market. Price fluctuations were minimal, trading volume was small, and the underlying trend was firm. Rubber shares trended stably.</p>
<p>London, 5th (Tuesday Dispatch): Today, the listed prices of Chinese foreign debt and Far East British merchant companies' stocks remained stable, with no changes in the market.</p>
<h3 id="e82">Yarn and Cotton: US Presidential Re-election, Yarn Prices Looking Down <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market, which rebounded the previous day, was slightly tired yesterday. Although there was no development in actual wholesale sales, Hong Kong merchants continued to demand 32-count and 42-count fine yarn, and the selling prices were firm. Therefore, some industry players held bullish views. However, general speculators, due to President Roosevelt's re-election in the US election, sold off as they expected the market to fall. Therefore, the battle between long and short positions remained intense. Today, 920 bales of cotton yarn were shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Spot yarn opened in the morning. Because of the good situation in the afternoon of the previous day, the sentiment continued to advance. The opening price of 20-count Double Horse yarn was 1,203 yuan, rising slightly to 1,205 yuan. Subsequently, it was heard that the exchange rate was flat, and the long positions released, falling back to 1,190 yuan. The price declined, and a new buying trend suddenly arose. Guangdong merchants were more active in business, and the market gradually rose to 1,202 yuan. However, there were rumors that the US president could be re-elected soon, the exchange rate would rise, and yarn prices would fall. The market then fell back to 1,185 yuan. However, large industry players tended to hold on, and it rebounded slightly. The closing price was 1,193 yuan. According to statistics, the amount of transactions in half a day was 5,730 bales. The market price of 20-count Bianma fell by 15 yuan. The amount of sales from various groups is listed below:</p>
<p>Hong Kong 630, Trade 5,100, Total 5,730</p>

<p>Spot cotton trading showed some development, and the sentiment was relatively stable. Although cotton from various production areas is prohibited from being exported, the selling prices are difficult to be cheap. Because food prices are high, villagers are unwilling to sell cotton at low prices.</p>
<p>Foreign Cotton Market Prices: The New York cotton market was closed all day yesterday due to the presidential election. The Indian market was quiet. Yesterday, the price fell by one rupee, including forecasts.</p>
<p>Shanghai Port Foreign Cotton Trading: Recent trading has continued to be extremely quiet. Factories remain on the sidelines. The industry, because of the current low inventory of spot goods in the market, although selling prices are sluggish, they are still unwilling to sell cheaply. However, according to the current market situation, cotton prices will not continue to fall.</p>

<p>Yesterday's groundnut oil market, due to the softening trend yesterday, continued to decline in the early morning. Suddenly, Hong Kong merchants came to purchase basket-packed oil, and the sentiment was agitated for a while. The market price rose slowly. In the afternoon, Qingdao also reported an increase. Hong Kong merchants continued their purchases, buying over 3,000 pieces. As a result, general speculators and hoarders were even more aggressive in adding to their futures positions. There was a lack of selling by original owners and retailers. Although trading was not rushed, the market price exceeded the previous day's price by two or three yuan. It was estimated that 3,300 pieces of Jiaozhou raw oil were traded at a price of 73 yuan, rising to 75 yuan. 50 pieces were ordered for delivery in lower November at a price of 73.75 yuan. 150 barrels of Qingdao butter were priced at 101.5-102 yuan. 300 barrels were ordered for delivery in lower November at a price of 103 yuan, falling to 102.5 yuan, and then rising to 104 yuan. 600 barrels were ordered for delivery in lower December at a price of 103.5-104.75 yuan. 50 pieces of Yantai raw oil were priced at 72.5 yuan.

<p>Since the blockade of the Mediterranean Sea, the local foreign tea market has plummeted. Recently, due to the Japanese control of sources in the occupied areas, arrivals have been exhausted, and the market has become increasingly desolate. Currently, only Taiwanese black tea is being mixed with Chinese tea for export. The rest is scarce. Yesterday, only Maruzen, Xingcheng, and other firms purchased over 220 boxes of local black tea, with selling prices ranging from 240 to 270 yuan. In addition, it is said that over 100 packages of Songluo Qiqiang and other teas for domestic sales were shipped to Tianjin for sale.</p>

Fuguigui fine cloth was 31.5 yuan, and fine twill was 30.075 yuan. The factory side had discussed 33 yuan for fine cloth and 11 yuan for fine twill, but it was called off because the factory was unwilling to open.

<p>Bamboo-joint steel bars, lately due to a sharp decrease in customer routes, coupled with minimal demand from local construction firms and even fewer stockpilers and small-scale buyers, the market situation is extremely bleak.

<h3 id="e91">Where Should Women Go? (1) <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>— Editor</p>
<p>In the recent discussions about women's future paths, Mr. Wu Qizhai argued that women should return to the home. He based his argument on various points, including physiology, psychology, society, the nation, career, self-reliance, and family, making it a representative work of those who advocate "women returning to the home." After receiving this manuscript, we specifically forwarded it to Ms. Jiang Yihui, who had previously published an article titled "Our Path" in this publication, asking her to express her opinions. It is impossible to publish both manuscripts simultaneously in the limited space of "Free Talk," and publishing them separately would likely lose the connection. Therefore, we plan to publish both manuscripts in installments concurrently, titled "Where Should Women Go?" as a small conclusion to the discussion of women's future paths and also as the beginning of the "Free Debate" column. We will continue to hold such debates when suitable topics are found.</p>
<p>Mr. Wu Qizhai believes that "When discussing this major issue, we cannot judge it based on just one or two individuals or from only one perspective. We should take women who are physiologically and psychologically normal as the subject and analyze and study them from all aspects to determine where women should ultimately go."</p>
<p>Ms. Jiang Yihui, on the other hand, believes that "We should have a correct understanding of the so-called 'women who are physiologically and psychologically normal.' We must know that a normal woman, like any normal man, hopes to progress and develop in her career, and she, like a man, desires to have a happy family. These desires are basic human needs. To enhance personal happiness and well-being, and to enable individuals to make the highest contribution to society, these desires should be reasonably satisfied and balanced in individual lives. It is incorrect to overemphasize women's interest in the family and neglect her interest in society. At the same time, it is unreasonable to expect all women who aspire to engage in social activities to sacrifice family happiness. Because they are normal women, their desires and abilities should have opportunities for normal development and expression. The fact that some women sacrifice their careers for the sake of their families, or have to sacrifice their families for the sake of their careers, is harmful and detrimental to both the individual woman and society."</p>
<p>I shouldn't say much more. The following is the beginning of their debate on "Women and Physiology":</p>
<h3 id="e92">Women Should Return to the Home <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>— Qi Zhai</p>
<p>(1) Women and Physiology: Humanity can continue endlessly because women have a unique "reproductive instinct" in their physiology. Since the "reproductive instinct" is a unique instinct of women, it naturally has a great impact on women's lives. After a woman gets married, she must become pregnant and give birth, which no one can forbid. From the beginning of pregnancy, new changes occur in a woman's physiology, and she needs rest from time to time. After childbirth, she needs at least four weeks of rest to recover from her physiological changes. During breastfeeding, she cannot work too hard, which would affect the milk and harm the baby's health. (Regarding breastfeeding, although there are now artificial methods to feed babies, it is always better than breast milk, because breast milk can naturally adjust the nutrients in the milk as the baby grows. Therefore, modern medical scientists, unless absolutely necessary, advocate "mother breastfeeding" in order to achieve the ideal health of the baby.) A woman's ability to give birth varies. On average, she gives birth every two years, so after a woman gets married, she needs a year of intermittent rest and another year of semi-rest in two years.</p>
<h3 id="e93">Women Should Enter Society <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>— Yihui</p>
<p>(1) Women and Physiology: From the physiological point of view, women's reproductive abilities vary. Some women are unable to give birth throughout their lives, while others give birth eight or more times in their lives. However, both of these types of women account for a very small minority of all women. The majority of women have an average of three to four births in their lifetime. During pregnancy, some women are able to work as usual without feeling tired at all. Some women are more prone to fatigue and should only engage in light work. A very small number of women need long-term rest during pregnancy and cannot work at all. This last type of woman is mostly affected by basic physical health problems and is therefore not included in our discussion.</p>
<p>Each time a woman gives birth, she needs a rest of eight to twelve weeks. Assuming a woman gives birth four times in her lifetime and needs twelve weeks of rest each time, she spends a total of forty-eight weeks (less than a year) on childbirth and recovery. Many people spend more time in bed due to illness than this! A year is very short in the whole of life. Can we bury a woman's entire life and sacrifice her possible contribution to society for twenty or thirty years because of this mere year? Perhaps some will say that it is not only childbirth that affects a woman's career. Breastfeeding also limits a woman's profession. However, we need to know that modern scientific methods of childcare do not require the mother to hold the baby all day long. Breastfeeding must be at a certain time, usually every four hours. Within these four hours, women have ample time to engage in any kind of useful work. It is true that overwork can affect breast milk, but if one stays at home all day without proper work, the milk can also become too thick and affect the baby's digestion. Therefore, many doctors agree that breastfeeding mothers should have adequate work and activities to regulate their lives.</p>
<p>Huo Sang Detective Case</p>
<h3 id="e94">The Ballerina's Ending <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>— By Cheng Xiaoqing</p>
<p>Chapter 10 The Shoe Problem</p>
<p>The three of us were originally standing on the sidewalk next to the car. At this time, Huo Sang first darted across the road and headed towards the Fengtai Cigarette Paper Store. Ni Jinshou and I naturally followed closely. Huo Sang went to the entrance of the cigarette paper store, took out a ten-yuan legal tender note, and bought a pack of Bai Jin Long cigarettes. His eyes carefully glanced around the store. I saw that there were a total of three people inside, two middle-aged clerks and one apprentice who was fifteen or sixteen years old. From the outside, there was absolutely nothing suspicious to be seen. The one who served Huo Sang and sold him the cigarettes was the apprentice who was fifteen or sixteen years old. Huo Sang, while examining the legal tender notes he received in change one by one, casually chatted, "Is your boss Lao Yan inside?"</p>
<p>The apprentice raised his eyes to look at Huo Sang's face, shook his head, and said, "He's gone out. Do you know him?"</p>
<p>At this moment, something unexpected happened. Ni Jinshou suddenly raised his left hand and shouted loudly, "Hey, Lao Han, what are you doing here?"</p>
<p>It turned out that at that time, someone had just poked his head out from behind the store to take a look, and was seen by Ni Jinshou. This person originally didn't want to come out, but was called out by Ni Jinshou, and couldn't avoid coming out to say a few words.</p>
<p>That person called Lao Han said, "Detective Ni, long time no see, how's the busy-ness going? Where are you headed?" Actually, that person wasn't old, wearing a light gray serge single robe, similar in stature and age to me, also very alert and intelligent in demeanor.</p>
<p>Ni Jinshou replied, "Just strolling around." He lowered his voice a little. "Lao Han, do you have someone here called Zhao Boxiong?"</p>
<p>That Lao Han asked, slightly surprised, "Zhao Boxiong? Yes, he was just here. Detective Ni, do you know him?"</p>
<p>Ni Jinshou replied, "Yes, is he still here at the moment?"</p>
<p>"He's already gone to Nanjing, he left less than ten minutes ago. What do you need him for?"</p>
<p>Ni Jinshou hesitated slightly, just about to say the words "he is," but Huo Sang quickly answered, "It's nothing. We just wanted to chat with him casually. Let's go, Detective Ni." He casually put the legal tender notes and cigarettes into his pocket and turned to leave.</p>

<h3 id="e95">Road Worker <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>— Liu Jiagan</p>
<p>I am willing to be a road worker.</p>
<p>High mountains and steep peaks cannot stop my path, small streams and trickles cannot evoke my sorrow; silently, perseveringly, paving the way forward... It's raining, and I give a hearty laugh to the sky, I thank the sky for giving me a natural "bath"; the thorns all over the ground don't attract my attention, even though my hands and legs are sometimes pricked, I just wipe away the flowing blood, "Never mind!" The wind is blowing hard, whistling, but I sing as if welcoming it, I hope the wind will send my singing to distant and remote places, where many friends are missing me, let them know that I am still so happy in the struggle, and there is absolutely no frustration.</p>
<p>The road stretches endlessly forward. Our predecessors opened half of it, then left; leaving shovels, mirrors, axes... for us, this younger generation! We extend our trembling hands, carefully accept this precious "gift", we are determined—or rather, it can be said to be our oath—to open a road to "brightness," where there is true human happiness....</p>
<p>Go forward, noble road workers! Your sweat and blood will not be shed in vain, and the rewards you receive will be praised!</p>
<p>I—am willing to be a road worker.</p>

<p>— Wei Wei</p>
<p>The play "Five Men of Justice" has not been performed often in recent years. The protagonist of this play, Zhou Wenyuan, was originally a martial arts actor who could sing and tumble, and Yang Xiaolou and Wang Changlin both performed this play in their early years, both excelling. This play is not very popular with non-professionals, and it is very difficult to please the audience. Therefore, very few people have performed it in recent times. The role of Zhou Wenyuan must be able to recite, and the recitation must be loud and clear. He must be able to fight, and the fighting must be clean. The acting and expressions are also very important. The supporting roles must also be well-organized. The painted face Yan Peiwei and the clown Di Hulu are both extremely important. In the past, when Xiaolou performed this, he used Qian Jinfu to play Yan Peiwei and Chuan Xiaoshan to play Di Hulu. The red flowers and green leaves complemented each other, and it was truly a masterpiece. Since Xiaolou's death, there have been very few martial arts actors who are good at performing this play. There are only Ru Fulan, Li Shengbin, and Ye Shengzhang from Fu Liancheng. Among these three, Shengzhang is slightly better than Fulan and Shengbin because he originally specialized in singing and tumbling, and his recitation and acrobatics are excellent.</p>
<p>Not long ago, the faculty and staff of the Shanghai Drama School performed this play. Rui Debao played this play, with Liang Liangui as Yan Peiwei and Shi Xiaoshan as Di Hulu, but the performance failed to satisfy the audience. Firstly, Lao Rui was old, his martial arts skills had deteriorated, and his voice was not good, and his recitation was not very pleasant, so it was difficult to achieve good results. Recently, I watched Ru Fulan perform this play in Huangjin, with Yuan Shihai playing Yan Peiwei and Sun Shengwu playing Di Hulu, and Zhang Lianting as the senior captain and Gao Shenghong as the second captain. All of them were disciples of Fu Liancheng, and their martial arts skills were pure and skilled. The performance was very lively and wonderful, and its highlights were unmatched by Rui Debao and Liang Lianjia.</p>
<p>Looking at the performance of Ru Fulan and others on that day, Yuan Shihai's Yan Peiwei was the most outstanding. His acting and expressions were excellent. In the fighting scene, there was a "flying kick" and a "canopy", which were clean and neat, showing great skill. I think Hou Xirui in his prime was only like this. However, the tunes sung by Shihai did not seem to be very skilled, perhaps because he had not performed this play for a long time, which was a minor flaw. Fulan's Zhou Wenyuan worked very hard, and Sun Shengwu's Di Hulu was also good, still performing "robbing the back" and "hanging hair," which could not be achieved without formal training. Zhang Lianting and Gao Shenghong's captains were also competent. The "Five Men of Justice" seen that day can be said to be rare in Jiangnan in recent years, so I have recorded it as above.</p>
<h3 id="e98">"Women" on Stage <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>— Jie</p>
<p>We know that there is a movie called "Women," starring more than a dozen female stars such as Norma Shearer and Joan Crawford. It is a new work that has no men but talks entirely about men's affairs. At that time, many viewers were thinking: If such a script with all women appearing could be staged on the stage, it would definitely be a sensation. Because this would not only create a new style for stage plays, but also unfold a very moving story in terms of content.</p>
<p>The China Travel Troupe is one of the professional drama troupes in Shanghai. Their female members seem to be more than those of other professional drama troupes. And they are always discovering new talents. For example, Sun Jinglu, who became famous in one fell swoop with "The Qin Huai Family," was originally a basic member of the China Travel Troupe. This time, Tang Huaiqiu suddenly had a whim and secretly rehearsed a "Women's Stage Play" with all female troupe members participating. This "Women's Stage Play" has been rehearsed skillfully and will meet the audience at the Xuan Palace starting tomorrow night (the 8th).</p>
<p>We don't hope that its story, like the movie, will not have much meaning. On the contrary, we can inspire a new era of consciousness and the outlook on life of new women from the mouths of women on the stage. This is a point that makes us pay attention.</p>
<p>Children's Historical Drama</p>
<h3 id="e99">"Xia Cungu" Completed <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>Wei Ruhui has recently completed the children's historical drama "Xia Cungu." Xia was a young hero of the late Ming Dynasty, from Songjiang. At the age of fifteen, he witnessed the daily decline of the country's affairs, and followed his teacher to raise the banner of righteousness in the Taihu Lake area. For a time, there were many responses. At the age of eighteen, he was captured by the Qing soldiers and killed in Nanjing. Half of the characters appearing in this play are children. It is said that it will be led by Qian Yi. Qian once played Xiao Li in "Regret of the Late Ming Dynasty" and Zheng Chenggong's son in "Sea Hero." He is a young actor who is well-known in the drama world today. If this play can be performed, it is said that it will be performed in the name of the "Midnight Drama Club." (Hai Xing)</p>

<p>— Xing</p>
<p>Bai Hong, an important supporting actor in the United National Troupe, recently informed the company's drama department that she should no longer be assigned roles in new plays, because she will be traveling far away to seek other developments. According to insiders, it is speculated that Bai Hong's departure is not to Yunnan, Chongqing and other places, and the destination is still unknown. According to Bai Hong, although she is not a top celebrity among the actors of the United National Troupe, she is highly valued for her superb acting skills. If she resigns, the United National Troupe will lose a good talent. It is a pity, and the "new road" where Bai Hong is going is very promising, and it is also worth considering for herself.</p>
