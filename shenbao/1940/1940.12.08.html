<h3 id="c2">醫生口中的樂口福 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>— 獨鶴</p>
<p>一個人連自己都不能相信自己。那，這個人還希望誰相信他。誰都不相信他。請問，這個人還有什麽事可做？個人如此。推而大之，一個國家一個民族何嘗不然</p>
<p>可是，中國人老就不肯相信中國貨。過去，幾於一切用品，都是舶來的好。好容易經過國貨界同人的努力，用事實來矯正這種歪曲的心理，慢慢地有了轉機。國貨的信譽，一天高似一天。大家都明白，國貨的用具，並不比舶來品壞。然而，說句老實話，在醫藥用品部門，似乎還未能樹立堅强的信心。生了病，用到藥，用到針，自然，這是一件不能嘗試的事情。醫生不肯嘗試，病人不敢嘗試—自古成功在嘗試，不嘗試，就難得不進展。於是，在這部門，最後勝利，還待各方面的努力。</p>
<p>一天在醫生家裏集會，忽聽見有人問醫生說，天冷了，吃些什麽？那位醫生脫口而出道：像樂口福那種東西很好。這人就問它與外國貨差不多麽？那位醫生答道：都是一樣原料，自然効力差不多，何必多化錢呢。我知道那醫生和九福沒有關係。從他口中介紹樂口福，當然可靠。因此我對樂口福，有了信任，至少，去了懷疑</p>
<p>我覺得，每個人都看重自己生命，這是不差的。所以用以治療的針和藥，不能隨便介紹。但是補品這樣東西，顯然和針藥不同，何必過於迷信舶來品。况且有醫生出口介紹，顯見得這種東西更靠得住，何妨大家試試看。自古成功在嘗試啊。</p>
<p>恕我不能說樂口福怎樣怎樣好。因爲，過份的誇大宜傳，與事實非但沒有用處，反而有害，所敢說的，只是那位醫生的話，像樂口福那種東西很好而巳。</p>

<p>— 蔣宗義</p>
<p>在這黑暗的孤島上，人是寂寞透了，偶爾飮幾杯濃冽的咖啡，也會興奮起來，但刺激下跟着來的必是整晚的失眠，於是思潮起伏，像萬浪奔騰，不可遏制，所以濃冽的咖啡，固然可口，但嫌太興奮神經，未嘗不是美中不足，</p>
<p>然而自從知道九福公司有了樂口福麥乳精出品後，我就以之代替了咖啡，因爲他有咖啡的醇味，還有滋補和煥發精神的力量，而無咖啡之過度刺激性，豈但無强烈興奮神經作用，反有安眠的功效。因此，我在極度勞心後，飮一杯樂口福，精神立即振作起來，晚間又可得着充分睡眠，所以在事實上我巳充分增進健康。假如把「樂」解作「好」的意思，那麽，樂口福就是好口福，而我的得以常飮樂口福，也正是我的好口福，現在九福公司除了樂口福麥乳精外又出一種樂口福滋養餅干，聽說將來還準備出樂口福滋養糖，那眞可說口福無窮，快樂無窮了。</p>
<h3 id="c7">樂口福給我的印象 <a href="#c7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>— 栖樺</p>
<p>近來頗有人慨嘆於洋貨的充斥興國貨的消沈，好像消費者天生就有一副崇洋的奴性心理似的。但這心理的養成，却要製造者與消費者共同負責。消費者貪圖便宜，製造者便粗製濫造，結果，虛有共表，大呼上當。</p>
<p>我常常想，這錯誤是必須糾正的，製造者必須認眞製造，消費者也須放出眼光。譬如倣製洋貨，至少要倣製得表裏如一，售價儘可能地减低，但不必低到需要偷工减料。這意見，我常和友人談起，因爲自巳身體多病，差不多三日兩頭吃藥，而「來路貨」補品，又貴得買不下手，我極希望有國貨可以買來代替的。</p>
<p>今年中秋，友人送我幾聽樂口福麥乳精，和樂口福餅干，朋友說，「別小覷了他，色香味三者，都和道地「來路貨」一樣，你常患失眠，晚上喝一杯睡覺，或是早晨當點心，那再好沒有了。」</p>
<p>我聽了並不在意，晚上，我仍照例沒精打彩地躺在椅子上，我的太太却把樂口福冲了一杯。笑盈盈地遞到我手裏，那股熱騰騰的香味，朝鼻子裏直冲，頓然精神爲之一振，她又去拿了兩塊餅干來，我邊喝邊吃，覺得香甜鬆脆，果然大快朶頣。於是那晚我便得到一次舒適的酣睡，但我仍以爲多少有點心理作用，後來一連幾天都是如此，而且精神充沛，凡事樂觀，確信樂口福實有寗神補腦的功效，對於神經衰弱特別適宜。說句老實話，我以前對於滋養補品也迷信洋貨。以爲如果買不起洋貨，那就寗可不買，因爲一般中國出品，靠不住的居多，現在「樂口福」一出，我這種偏執成見，自然消除了，我感謝九福公司。他不僅以和洋貨同樣的品質，售比洋貨低廉的價格，並且由於這樣的貨眞價實，同時糾正了一般人迷信洋貨的心理。</p>
<p>現在，九福公司以樂口福求過於供的關係，已自瑞士購來最新式的機械，預備大量生產，精益求精，前幾天聽說他們要出紀念特刋，爲「樂口福」張目，我便很高興地寫了這篇短文，因爲一向神經衰弱的我，自從服了樂口福之後，也虎虎有生氣了，「樂口福」的誕生，的暢銷，他的意義，遠在一般人所謂「營業發達」之上，他對國民的健康，巳盡了最大的與最好的貢獻了！</p>
<h3 id="c8">色香味皆上上 <a href="#c8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>— 馮夢雲</p>
<p>上月，九福公司招宴，貽余樂口福麥乳精及滋養餅干各二，歸遺妻兒，餅干則於一二日間，即爲兒　所盡，惟麥乳精余必於臨睡前冲飮之，輒覺其芬芳清冽，有非其他冲飮品所能方擬者，抑且絕無沉澱，此其所以可貴歟。</p>
<p>九福公司，在新藥業中，歷史最稱悠久。手創者爲黃楚九先生。彼時黃先生發明百齡機一種，以「有意想不到之効力」名於時。　出補力多，聲譽益高，市塲中竟推爲祭酒，迄今猶未有其他補藥足與補力多競爭者。九福公司之名亦因補力多而大振。嗣後九福公司每有出品問世，未有不風行者，是皆得力於補力多旺銷之功也。</p>
<p>樂口福麥乳精爲九福公司近年新出品中之最有力者，今虞洽卿路中新設霓虹燈一架，巍巍矗立，行人過者，　不注目，其銷路之日暢一日，定可預卜，筆者已嘗飮月餘，願以『色香味，皆上上』六字，爲之作定評焉。</p>
<h3 id="c9">我愛樂口福 <a href="#c9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>— 周天籟</p>
<p>我是一個靠文字爲生涯的人，一年三百六十五天，沒一天不絞腦汁，一面寫，一面以烟捲助長文思，明知無益，然苦無代替品，糖果零食，非我所好，每到夜晚，往往感覺舌燥唇乾，精神疲憊。近有朋友勸我飮九福公司出品樂口福麥乳精，每晚筆債還清後冲飮一杯，果然味美可口，解渴提神，頓失以前倦怠之苦，再佐以樂口福滋養餅乾數片，充飢解渴，兼而有之，身心安慰，殊非淺鮮，我得感謝我友的誠意介紹，同時更欽佩九福公司的出品精良，足與同性質之舶來品相頡頏。茲聞該公司最近運到最新式機器以製造之，更精益求精，誠乃國貨之光，而正是我的「口福」無窮。現在連我的兒女也都愛飮樂口福麥乳精，尤其出世六閱月女兒，日睛樂口福餅乾五片，這是事實。</p>
<h3 id="c10">由樂口福餅乾談到父子論爭 <a href="#c10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>— 雪犀</p>
<p>有一天，我和空我一方夢雲幾位先生，在一起吃飯。因爲我方與人在報上爭論父子問題，因而我們的談話，便也無意中談到了這個問題。我的見解，是父母無不痛愛自己的兒女的，所以爲人子者，也該孝順他的父母。我的立論根據，是看到了內子對於子女的撫養，是用盡了心血，吃盡了辛苦，使我不得不想起我的父母在日，也何嘗不是這般的盡心盡力，對於兒女，是抱着何等的期望。所以我的主張，做子女的，看到自己對於所生的子女，是怎樣的愛護，便不能忘了愛我如我愛我的子女一般的父母了。那時我正買了兩聽樂口福餅乾，預備帶回去給一陽吃的，便指着餅干，證明父母愛子之心。夢雲却認爲我的話不對，他說子女根本是靠不住的，所以父母對於子女，正不必抱有什麽希望。但我總覺做父母的，雖不望報於子女，而子女却不能不盡其心力，來報罔極深恩於萬一。空我注視了我的餅干，笑道：「我曾說與其開舖子賣老年人吃的補藥，倒不如賣小兒玩具來得好。」這話很有含蓄，很有意味，那便是說世上愛護子女的人，畢竟比孝敬父母的來得多，我肚裏也在想，如果我的父母尙健在，我却未必能買些補品給他老人家服食，可是我今聽到九福公司的樂口福滋養餅乾，是用最上等餅乾原料加入適量的樂口福麥乳精，按照科學方法精製而成，內含蛋白質，脂肪質，及甲乙丙丁各種維生素，實是兒童最適合最滋補的食品，並且又美味，又可充飢，我便忙着買兩聽帶回去，這正足見父母對於子女的關切愛護了。惟其如此，做兒子的，又何可忽略辜負了爲父母者的一片苦心呢。一方對於任何事，是素來極馬虎的，可是聞知樂口福滋養餅乾是兒童的恩物後，便問價錢，說也要去買兩聽，我點頭微笑，這也是父母愛護子女的一證。因記其事，算是父子論爭的題外文章。希望有子女的人，讀了此文，知道樂口福滋養餅乾，是兒童的恩物，但同時希望有父母的人，也能讀完此文，使他知道父母愛子之心。</p>
<h3 id="c11">病中的恩物 <a href="#c11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>— 嬰甯公子</p>
<p>樂口福麥乳精，是九福公司的出品之一，在朋友中，服樂口福的很多，我平常不十分喜歡進滋補之劑，因此沒有嘗試過，不過知道樂口福麥乳精，近年來已能奪舶來品之席，因此我雖然不吃這東西，但人家提起樂口福，我對他也頗有好感，原因就是他能够打倒外國貨，這原該是爲國家挽回漏巵不少的。最近，我患了幾天病，就是所謂登革熱，我是個獨處的人，病了無人問湯藥，因此進了國際療養院，院中供給病人一日三餐，下午還有一頓點心，就是樂口福麥乳精與樂口福餅干。病中，嘴裏感覺苦得很，正需要甜的飮食調劑，樂口福麥乳精與餅乾，這就配了我的胃口，不但將它認作是病中的唯一恩物，現在我病好了，也還是每天冲着樂口福麥乳精喝，因爲過去我僅僅對他有好感，而現在則成爲我的嗜好了。萬不料爲了病，竟與樂口福結了這重緣，而醫院裏也採用樂口福作爲病者的點心，足見這東西，眞是有益於人生的滋補品了。</p>
<h3 id="c12">樂口福能退鬼 <a href="#c12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>— 廚司</p>
<p>有人看了這個題目，也許要嚇一跳，樂口福是一種滋養品，又不是張天師的符，怎樣能够退鬼，這不是危詞聳聽麽，我說，這話一點也不打謊，完全是事實，且讓我慢慢道來。</p>
<p>我在去冬，下了一個決心，請醫生把我的身體調整一下，可是在調整之際，我竟成了一個形虚體弱的人，做起事來沒精打彩，抬起頭來金蒼蠅像羣鶯亂飛，吃起飯來一些沒有滋味，一切的一切，都變得枯燥乏味。</p>
<p>大約是今年陰曆年初三罷，晚上沒有事，就老早睡覺，電燈沒有關，一聦醒轉來，床面前忽然立了了一個無頭女子，站着不動，我自忖在這半夜三更，何以有這樣一個不速的女客，難道眞像聊齋上所說的狐狸精來了麽？那時吾也不害怕，反而把眼睛睜睜大，看個明白，就見這個女子慢慢地縮短，愈縮愈小，縮到後來，影蹤也沒有了。</p>
<p>第二天到報館裏，把昨天晚上見鬼的事，說了一遍，大家都說那裏有什麽鬼，也許你是神經衰弱太厲害的緣故罷，還得找個醫生去看看，我想這話倒也言之有理，乃去請敎一位醫生，醫生亦斷定是神經衰弱，除了吃些藥之外，還叫我常服樂口福，因爲樂口福有治療腦鹘虧，神經衰弱等特殊功效。我聽了醫生之話：買了兩聽樂口福，服了之後，果然精神大振，晚上睡亦睡得着，從此便把樂口福作爲我的常服品，到現在身體日胖，大有大腹便便之槪，而晚上也從來不再見鬼了。以此說來，樂口福豈不是能退鬼麽。我想，朋友們如果怕閙着活見鬼的怪事，大家倒要多吃向罐樂口福來保養保養正氣。</p>

<p>自樂口福麥乳精問世，行銷之盛，據調查所得，與舶來品爲三千與一百五十之比。見國產滋補物之暢銷，乃知出品人初不枉投偌大資財，以塞漏巵，良可慰也。一二月來，愚服此品無間。愚體羸弱，終年食補劑，顧持之無恒，旬日或一月輒止，獨啖樂口福而至今無饜者，則以其擅色香味三者之勝也。晨起一餐，和生雞卵一枚於其中，臨臥一餐，則略注牛乳，爲法固未必合律，而入口彌甘，於是演爲習慣矣。明樓閒詠，嘗得句云：「曾煩素手學調羹，色與香兼味亦醇，一盞奉郞宜惜取，更因口福祝長生。一閨中人嗜此亦餈，故有是句也。</p>

<h3 id="c24">德國誘和希臘之風傳 <a href="#c24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>前天正當義大利軍隊自阿爾巴尼亞前綫繼續敗退的時候，忽傳德國擬託土耳其國調停義布戰事，並有和平方案業經土國外長提交希臘之說。消息是美國通信社發的，但其來源却在匈牙利南斯拉夫兩國京城，南國京城消息則係輾轉得自被牽涉的土耳其；假定此訊果有幾分眞實性，似乎這又是軸心國方面不知道第幾决的和平攻勢。截至昨晚爲止，關係各國對於此一傳聞。「既不證實，又不吾認一，說不定一兩天內也許就有正式吾認發表出來；但杲吾認儘管吾認、空穴來風，仍不能不令人懷疑事出有因，何况關於一切和牛攻勢的吾認，又往往是在「碰壁」之後，用來掩蔽失敗的一種恣　呢。</p>
<p>綜觀今世若干交戰國所迭次採川的和平攻勢。大體上小外三種：（一）是企圖懈怠敵有鬬志，因此有時反成爲加紫進攻或聲東擊西的烟幕：（二）祇是製造空氣，其用意祗在破壞敵方的對外關係或離間敵方的內部團結：（三）也有時候發動和平攻勢者，確有若干求和之意。但往往因不肯走光明　落的正途，以致緣木求魚，愈求愈遠；前兩種是合有毒性的策略，後一種是方法大謬，其性質雖異，失敗則一。德國此决誘和希臘的傳說，如果屬實，其用意究在拆散英希的同盟？或預備今後的助戰？抑或眞正有感於巴爾幹戰事之不易爲，而竟甘願委曲求全，以免事態之惡化？這是數天之內即可打開的一謎。</p>
<p>試推究此誘和傳說之所以受人注意。及其所以被人懷疑有幾分眞實性，主要原因不外兩個：一即義大利軍事之意外失敗，二即德國助戰之意外遲延。因爲義軍可謂自始沒有勝過，即在最同情黑衫軍的人們，恐怕也不免要開始担心它能否轉敗爲勝；因爲德國的忸怩作態，忽而向土耳其保證不參加巴爾幹戰事，忽而又聲明不撤退希臘境內之僑民，於是更使人懷疑柏林當局受了蘇聯的牽掣和保加加利亞的一拆台，」似乎已有點知難而退；當然，這種種表示或者僅是作態而已，其實隨時有演變爲實際助戰的可能。不過，單就義大利作戰失敗的現實而言，目前之不能便國社政府感覺興奮、却是無可諱言。</p>
<p>希臘軍之攻入阿爾巴尼亞境內者，大體上言之，可分三路：（一）北路自佔領柯里柴高地後，即分兵兩支，一支北上，一舉而攻陷波格拉台克城，又自該城向西北推進，據說已進抵距愛爾巴桑城十八公里亦即距阿爾巴尼亞京城四十二公里之某小村；一支向西北疾進而佔領摩斯柯波里斯城，不難遙相呼應，以威脅德伏里河與斯根比河間之油田。（二）中路是沿維奧薩河進攻，已佔領亥河上游的普萊梅蒂港；今後正將溯該河西下，以奪取克里蘇拉與台貝里尼兩港，然後再直搗沿海的伐羅那港。（三）南路是由海陸兩軍協同作戰的，已將阿爾巴尼亞西南端的聖瓜朗達港佔領；這是一個更此攻克柯里柴高地還重要的勝利；因爲據說英希兩國聯合艦隊今後即將利用該港，作爲進擾義大利南部的根據地；加之阿奇洛加斯特洛城亦有陷落之說，台爾維諾城已在兩面夾攻之下，盛傳此一方面的義軍，正忽忽沿着海岸向基瑪拉港撤退。</p>
<p>根據上面關於戰局的說明。雖小敢斷定希臘的必勝，但至少可說黑衫軍已遭遇全綫的敗衂。據英國軍事專家的觀察。希臘不把阿爾巴尼亞的伐羅那與杜拉索兩港佔領，是不能把握最後勝利的；所以爲希臘計，似乎仍以再接再厲，繼續追擊爲是。德國的和平攻勢或者竟是一種緩兵之計。而使黑衫軍捲土車來；這樣。雅典政府的苦戰不是將要功敗垂成了嗎？何况。義國陸軍總參謀長巴陀格里奧上將和義屬多台喀尼斯羣島總督的相繼辭職，雖一方可作爲墨索里尼準備加緊作戰的看法，但同時却正可反映義國軍事當局的才難，這在希臘政府不正是乘勝揚威的最好機會嗎？</p>

<p>五月六日，我冉和萊諾會面，見他精神頹喪，舉動常失。他的辦公桌上裝着三具電話，一具通內閣，一具通至外界，還有一具直達　爾蒂伯爵夫的的密室。那最後一具鈴聲常不絕於耳。萊諾拿起聽筒，總是祗聽得一秒鐘，便不耐煩地叫起來。道，「是的……是的，當然…但是我要懇求你，讓我做一點工作吧……」</p>
<p>最後他竟置之不答了。</p>
<p>後來，挪威形勢日非。德軍配備的優良，此時已初露鋒茫。德　事先的準備，周密細到，詳盡無遺，法國却倉猝應敵，使英勇將士，皆因設　欠缺高射砲稀少，而暴露於敵機炸彈機關槍之下，雙方相去，何啻天壤。就是　樂觀的人，也要如冷水澆項，心灰意懶了。萊諾以爲法國缺乏準備，到此不幸的地步，皆應由其政敵負責。</p>
<p>他吿訴我說，他們上下朦蔽，甚至連達蘭海軍中將的一對信，也不給我知道。地的信內，把困難之處說得很是詳細，假使我早知如此，也就　避不　了。今天下午，我將出席參議院，委員會，我要把一切眞相，向他們和盤托出。」</p>
<p>這時達拉第和萊諾爭鬥愈烈，以致勒白倫總統不得不挿身干預，從中做一個和事老。</p>
<p>五月十日上午九時，我籌備如何到鄉村去休假。可是在八時三十分鐘，我已從無綫電中聽到報吿，知道德軍已侵入荷蘭比利時。總攻已開始了道時休假的都被召回營，我也到北車站，準備回到阿拉斯防地。火車加上了數節，英法士兵還是擁擠不堪。我聽見附近一個步兵上尉止和他的妻子話別。地說：</p>
<p>「愛妻，聽着！玻璃衣橱的左手抽屣中有錢放着，床磁小桌的抽屜中又有些零錢，都可拿出來用。汽車間和車門上的鑰匙，都在我房中，放在抽屜橱上面的茶盤裏。叫貝得在我脫下的衣服裏放些樟腦。琴痕的脚踏車已發出軋聲，要擦些油了。你說什麼？這兩天過得眞快嗎？不錯，只要我們能阻住敵軍，戰爭或者就此結束了。」</p>
<p>他的妻子面露笑容，樣子很勇敢。若說攻勢未起前，法國的士氣已衰，這是不確的。上層階級和消息靈通的人，或者會意志消沉，但是民衆仍充滿着希望，無錢電每天播音八次，更把他們麻醉了。</p>
<p>德軍在色當美破法軍陣綫的消息一旦傳來，恍如晴天霹靂，全出巴黎市民意料之外。他們準備在必要時攷慮撤退。他們在一九一四年已獲得充分經騐，他們相信敵人的攻勢，不久便可遏阻。到了五月十七日，德國機械化兵團一縱隊，已直趨拉翁，甘茂林勸吿政府道，過了今夜，巴黎能守與吾，他就不敢担保了。這一天，內閱混亂恐慌達於極點。</p>
<p>决日早晨，巴黎市民聽說德軍已轉趨英吉利海峽，知道還有幾天的喘息餘地。這時大局阽危，萊諾忽然的勇氣倍增，把他一再遷延的舉動，毅然實施。他認甘茂林須負失敗的責任，堅主撤換，又因達拉第力爲甘茂林辯護，所以把他調仟外交部長，由自己兼長陸軍部。至於新總司令屬誰呢。萊諾欲舉喬治，蓄心已久，却怕甘茂林太下不去。甘茂林喬治兩人的互相水火，正不亞於萊諾和達拉弟兩人呢！</p>
<p>英軍某將領曾說，「他們忙於內閧，自然無暇和德軍交戰了！」</p>
<p>此外，曾在摩洛哥和北菲卓著戰績的諾蓋斯將軍，亦有當選希望。靑年將領中洪齊格和吉勞特兩人，都有部下擁戴。洪齊格足智多謀，曾率部堅抗德軍。吉勞特也是一個傑出將才，祇因恃勇輕敵，在那時已身爲俘虜了。萊諾最後纔決定以近東法軍司令魏剛將軍調任，把他趕急的回巴黎。魏剛在一九一八年時，軍職　次於福煦將軍。福煦在戰局垂危之時，接統大軍，竟得反敗爲勝。魏剛旣曾與他共事，萊諾當然要借車他的經騐了。</p>
<p>同時萊諾更以副總理一席奉與宿將　當。</p>
<p>依照多數法國人的眼光看來，貝當聲望隆重，非他人所能望其項背。他狀貌尊嚴，身材高大，外加一種冷峭的神情，使見他的人，莫小在腦海中深留印象。上决世界大戰中獲得光榮戰績的六員上將，現存的祇有兩人，一是法朗沙另一人就是　當。他雖已屈八十四歲高齡，却是精神矍鑠，老當益壯，使人愈深敬畏。</p>
<p>萊諾召貝當人閣，作爲臂助，以爲藉此公大名，必能增强自己的地位，團結全國的輿論。不料他的新回僚，竟然徒有虛名，他纔知道計算錯誤。他只算是找到了一個繼任人物和他自己的審判官員。</p>
<p>六月六日，達拉第完全退出政治舞台，萊諾和他的傾軋方吿終止，幾個月前，達拉第遼是法國的主人翁，大權在握，有炙手可熱之勢，一朝風潮忽起，卽被吹得無影無踪，當他悄然隱去的時候，竟無一語懺悔，亦未表示絲毫驚奇。</p>
<p>久在達拉第卵冀之下的甘茂林將軍，這時也已　影家園，住在福煦路一所安靜的別墅裏。他穿了平民服裝，忙於打字，預備做一篇爲自己辯護的回憶錄。</p>
<p>當廿茂林得勢時節，與他闔家相識的一位女友，在他們失勢之時，仍能不忘舊誼，於退出巴黎前往見甘茂林夫人。她見甘茂林夫人態度仍極安閒鎭靜。</p>
<p>廿夫人說，「將軍和我同居着，他不想自己，只掛念着法國和他舊日的部下。他對於魏剛將軍非常欽敬，希望他能阻檔敵車。</p>
<p>她手指一室，顯露出她是一個溫婉賢淑，愛夫心切的女子。我們先前曾到過室中，那裏掛着將軍母親親筆所繪的甘茂林幼年小像，身穿長衣，手敲銅鼓，很　活潑可愛。</p>
<p>她興奮地說，一你聽到嗎？那是他一具小小的打字機所發出的聲音。」</p>
<p>以上所訐，部是私人間的嚴重衝突，使戰事進行，遇到重重困難，固然這種傾軋歷代皆有，嫉妒野心原爲人類所不免。一九一四年時，克來孟梭和普恩加來紗統，亦曾發生意見，但是法國終於獲得勝利。那時候執　諸公，人格高尙，愛國心重，所以能戰勝私欲。曹恩加萊雖不喜克來孟梭，却能與之忠誠合作。貝當亦克已下人，甘受福煦動制。一九四〇年法國情形就不同了，黨派分立，嫌隙至　，公共道德，又　趨沒落。私人仇恨，　　無防　。雖脫人格問題，非法國失敗的主囚，英法在軍事上，外交上，工業上，事事缺乏準備，乃是她取收之道，然而　員之間，明爭　鬥，傾軋不已，又沒有魄力堅强的領袖，足以統一全國，軍隊方面，亦因此失去最後抵抗的機會了。（完）</p>

<p>— 聖凱瓊</p>
<p>中美金融合作</p>
<p>十月中各方所傳　國將積　予申國以經濟援助的消息，業經在日本助所謂「南京政府」簽訂私的聲中，具體地證實了。十一月底，美國羅斯福總統宜稱：美國將以美金一萬萬元借給中國，其中的半數將供一般的用途，半數則用以保障中國幣制及維持中美通貨關係。十二月二日，美參議院銀行業務委員會和衆議院錢幣委員會一致通過美國以一萬萬元貸給中國底辦法。此數的一半由進出口銀行所撥付，一半則撥自國庫平準基金。</p>
<p>這次借款的辦法據電訊所傳，關於進出口銀行所撥付的是供一般的用途，借給的方式，據中央債務專員璞斯氏致羅斯福總統函中所稱：金儲復興公司的附屬機關五金儲備公司，現在續向中國資源委員會訂購鎢·銻·錫等物，計値六千萬元，照繳貨時適合市况的價　在今後數年中繳貨。不過爲　助中國應付其目前金融問題起見，美國輸出入銀行已允冉以五千萬　借給中國，由中國中央銀行担保，而以上述的定購的五金折付。可見是一種商業上的信用放款，與過去第一决第二次的信川放款在借給的方式上是同的，而在運用的方式上是不同的。一九三八年十二月十五日的二千五百萬美金和一九四〇年三月七日的二千萬美金底信用借款，是用以轉買美國農產品·五金·汽油·卡車·造路機·開礦機·溶礦機等品，以及其他建設上必需的原料，而此决則是襄助中團應付目前的金融問題·與第三决（一九四〇年九月二十六日）的信用借款，非但在借給的方式上是同的，卽在運用的方式上亦是相似的，因美官方文吿是稱：美政府以美金二千五百萬元貸與中國以維持中國外滙上的需要。</p>
<p>其决，關於國庫平準基金所撥付的是供平準法幣之用，借給的方式，據美財長摩根索二日所稱：政府現尙未決定一切平準法幣的詳細計劃，不過這項計劃無疑的將依照現在與宋子文氏所談判中的　率以購買法幣，詳細的內容常談話未在華盛頓成立及宋子文氏不允洩露之前，美國不能正式發表。同時摩氏鄭重聲稱：平準基金僅將從事於小準工作，對於中國旣不是借款亦不是信用，僅以美元購買　幣而已。</p>

<p>— 浩</p>
<p>自上海物價作直綫之上漲，勞資間隨卽發生津貼問題。　一般職工以所得薪資，不敷維持其家庭生活，乃紛向賣方要求加給津貼，資方亦以不能強使職工一枵腹從工」，自動的或被動的對職工作增加薪津之舉、以津貼辦法與夫數目大小，多由資方任意酌定，漫無合理根據，有照原薪加幾成者，亦有一律津貼數十元者。職工得此，縱可勉渡難關於一時，然生活恐慌實未從此消失。蓋以物價變動不居，有增無减，而津貼則固定有限，設此月增薪數元，往後數月生活費父復激增，則增數　之數復何有濟，無怪　般職工始終惶惶然也。物價冉高，生活費冉漲，職工依然不克支持生活，自必再度要求加薪，循環往復，殊非持久之道。吾人觀於過去各業工潮屢作，揆厥原因，實由所行津貼辦法未能適應此種情勢所致。過去輿論方面雖間有論及，欲求一具體能行之折衷法則，則未之覯。此一問題縈總筆者　際者多時，近且所受生活威脅日益加劇，復以服務之公司所行津貼辦法，一如其他之不澈底，乃如骨梗在喉，不吐不快，爰不揣　陋，竊願以不偏不倚之態度，對於此一問題有所陳議。並冀拋　引玉焉！</p>
<p>原職工以勞力換取工資，用以維持家庭生活，今所得工資，因物價高漲，亦卽貨幣購　力低落之結果，不敷維持，由資方予以相當補償，提高其薪資數目，實爲應盡之責也。惟是究應根據何種標準，以提高</p>
<p>生活費津貼應採「推制」　　浩</p>
<p>自上海物價作直綫之上漲，勞資間隨卽發生津貼職工收入乎，筆者以爲應採用「推移制（Sliding　scalesystem）」，卽以一定之一標準工資」，一定之「津貼成數，按月依據工部局工業科所公布之工人生活費較基期增加之倍數比例增减津貼。以期適應物價變動之情勢，解除職工生活之恐慌，其詳具如下述。</p>
<p>考工部局所公布之工人生活費指數，實爲維持一定生活程度應需費用之可靠測度表。計分食物，房租，衣着，燃料，雜項，共五項；然此五項費用均爲維持生活所必需，故另列總指數，計本年十一月份爲五四〇·六二。（以二十五年爲基期）。復以近來費用日高，工人生活程度下降，故按降低程度之費用而言，計增三·九一倍。現所建議採用者，卽津貼應據此所增倍數，按月比例增减之，此乃圾台理最切實之根據也。</p>
<p>顧有此最合理最切實之標準，以筆者所知，上下竟無採用之者。然吾人嘗聞勞方每提依據生活費指數增薪之要求，輒爲資方所拒，甚至資方一聞「指數」二字，卽搖首示厭，覺以生活費指數過高，資方有其自身之困難，往往無力作此同比例之增薪，遂至因噎廢食歟？實則各業資產與營業狀况不同，難以强其作同等數目之津貼，亦爲衆所認知之事實。但祗須將辦法稍事折衷變通，則任何廠號均能採用。所謂變通，卽增减津貼之一定百分比，而適應物價變動之功效則一。例如資方財力充裕者，津貼白分之百不爲多；若財力確有不及者，亦不妨稱减津貼之百分率，定爲白分之七十，四十，但最低限度不能少於百分之二十五。</p>
<p>又聞人言：「大有大難，小有小難，」意謂此時薪資小者，生活固難維持：薪資大者，亦有其困難也。但筆者以爲，丁此時艱，薪資大者（指月薪數百元者）尙不妨將生活享受略　减低，以資維持；而薪資小者，則所度生活原爲「起碼」者，事實上旣無法降低，因之需要增加津貼愈亟，故依據原薪大小比例增加，顯不切合實際，而應另行定二標凖工資。以此標準工資　生活費增高之倍數，或津貼之百分率，卽爲每一職工，不論原薪大小，應得之生活費津貼數。</p>
<p>舉　言之：十一月份生活費較　斯增三·九一倍，假定標準工資爲五十元，又假定津貼之百分率爲〇·二五，其算式如下：</p>
<p>（3.91×0.25）×＄50＝0.9775×＄50＝＄48.87四十八元八角七分卽爲十一月份職工應得之津貼。</p>
<p>上列之標準工資，乃筆者個人以一五口家庭，試作舉例之估計，並無切實根據，未可視爲定則。此項標準工資，甚望工部局工業科製定公布，以便各業當局有所準據，想該科當亦樂於從事也。</p>
<p>各業賢明當局，果能採行此一勞永逸之制，以津貼職工，在職方固可　减牛活恐慌，安心生產工作；而資方亦可免應付人事糾紛之煩，以及不幸之損失，不亦一舉兩得其益乎？</p>

<h3 id="c72">提高職員津貼後　工部局支出激增　每年開支將短缺一千萬　非二次舉債卽須加捐稅 <a href="#c72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>工部局發言人昨日（七日）披露、該局核准提高僱員之生活津貼後、每月將增加支出七八千萬兀、以資應付、此項數字、乃「的略估計、工部局本年旣已兩度允加僱員津貼、則一九四〇年度之預算、諒將入不敷出、其不足之額總數若干、目下不能披露、局方刻正準備財政詳報、不久將予公布、而公布之前、未能言定不足數字究爲若干、</p>
<p>本年預算　短少千萬</p>
<p>惟據此間某財務專家聲稱、觀於年內工部局迭加職員之津貼、其一九四〇年度之預算、至少將不足一千萬兀、工部局曾於本年七月一日加捐什五、並向匯豐銀行舉債一千六百萬元、而獲得特殊收入、估計其收入額共達三千二百萬元、但預料此款業已撥充其他必要之開支、</p>
<p>續加捐稅　頗有可能</p>
<p>故工部局恐將在年內二次舉債、或召集納稅人臨時大會、俾能續加捐稅、局方如果有此一舉、則公共租界捐稅、諒將再增什三云、同時、工部局警務等處僱員、對於局方准加生活津貼、均表熱烈之滿意、若干警員稱、當局應早取此舉、則局員或不　大批辭職、而警務處與火政處人員、亦無怠工之虞、</p>
<p>A級職員　生活津貼</p>
<p>工部局情報處、昨發表消息云、查關於本局昨發「增加華捕及職員津貼」公吿一件、其尾末應加入「A級職員領受匯兌津貼者、僅按其基本薪給三分之二部份、發給生活津貼、卽按其薪給三分之二之起首五百元部份、發給津貼百分之一百五十、餘類推」一項、</p>

<h3 id="c101">日本南進的阻力 <a href="#c101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>關於日本的南進政策及其阻力，本刋茲將美國兩大報的紀載，譯錄如下：</p>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>日本經由德義兩國的竭力拉攏，業已與之簽訂　事經濟同盟條的。我們很可相信，若非中國把日本牽制住，日本或已參加戰爭了。</p>
<p>除越南而外，緬甸和荷屬東印度的豐富資源，大可問鼎。德日兩國曾有一種密的，只要時機一到，荷屬東印度卽由各該國平分秋色，由德國取蘇門答臘，新加坡和馬來聯邦，而以爪哇，荷屬婆羅洲與附近各島嶼歸日。自從德國侵荷成功，德國就認爲這時機已經到了。</p>
<p>可是日本現方陷入困境，因此別有見地。中國的抵抗力尙未擊破。日本軍隊尙有一百五十萬人，深陷於亞洲大陸的泥淖。日木苦戰三載，經濟財政已大見削弱了。</p>
<p>日本艦隊在世界上的地位號稱第三，有戰鬥艦九艘，艦齡雖都在二十年以上，但因屢决重修和改良，仍可隨時出　。此外尙有航空母艦五艘，新式重巡洋艦十二艘，輕巡洋艦二十七艘，驅逐艦一百十二艘，潛水艇六十艘。</p>
<p>英國欲在現狀下加强其遠東艦隊，勢有不能。因之，美國若尙未準備充分，未能以武力對抗變更荷屬東印度現狀的任何企圖，則在即論上購，日本在西太平洋的海軍實力，可說是唯我獨尊。</p>
<p>再就理論上說，日本頗能予澳州和新西蘭兩地以嚴重的威脅。但就實際而論，日本的地位也有許多躬點。第一，日本在扶桑三島以外，缺乏海軍根據地，以修理龐大的戰艦。實則日本之外，遠東方面足稱第一流海軍根據地的，祗有英屬新加坡一處，而新加坡離日本却有三千　里之遙。</p>
<p>新加坡防禦鞏固，守衛嚴密，已成强有力的堡壘。可是要征服荷屬東印度或澳洲，非先攻佔新加坡不可。日本欲達此目的，勢須遠涉東洋，出動大部份主力艦隊。假使這時候美國出而干涉，以拊日本之背，則陷在中國泥淖的日木軍隊將有海上交通被截斷的危險而陷於絕地。若退一步想，假使日本不避危險，決心一戰，其最合理的舉動，必是襲擊蘇門答臘，據此以作圍攻新加坡的據點。</p>
<p>不過荷蘭在當地的防禦亦不容輕視。記者在去年歐戰尙未爆發之前，曾作實地視察，對於該處的空軍實力和海陸防禦，都獲有深刻印象。</p>
<p>還有一層，假使日本果先取蘇門答　，就無異遏阻德國的雄心。或謂日本將先取得法屬越南和泰國的軍事統制，然後南下攻新加坡，觀於最近日本在越南的舉動，更顯示這戰略或大有採取的可能。可是越南交通困難，氣候惡劣，如欲加以統制，不免曠日持久，所費尤將不資。</p>
<p>另一個攫取的目標，當然是富饒的香港。但是香港也已成爲强固的堡壘，必將與以堅强的抵抗，目在中國腹地的華軍，人數日衆，日軍一旦圍攻香港，他們就將起而反攻了。况目香港　使失陷，也決不能決定最後勝敗。</p>
<p>日本或將避過新加坡砲臺和英國海軍所控制的麻六甲海峽，而派遣巡洋艦潛水艇，由蒂摩爾海侵人印度洋，以擾亂英國海上貿易。日本甚或冒險派遣海車，在義屬東菲洲的海港設立根據地，以參加全面戰爭。可是這許多海港旣非良港，且早已被炸得體無完膚。又况日本空軍鞭長莫及，艦隊遠涉重洋，必將大受英國空　的困擾。日木若要派遣威力强大的艦隊遠入紅海，未免太覺輕率，若僅派小隊海軍，則英國駐在東地中海的龐大艦隊，卽可抽出一部越過蘇彝士運河，以與日本海軍相周旋。</p>
<p>此外，日本祇剩一個大規模攻擊　洲或新四蘭的計畫了。過去兩年開，澳洲和新曲蘭的充實電備計畫，進步甚速。澳洲史　龐大的陸空軍，以保衛本土。澳洲北部諸省，人烟稀少，日軍在此登陸，殊無效力可言。日本要眞正威脅澳洲，非在工業和財富蒼萃的南部以大隊遠征軍登陸不可。</p>
<p>日本商船的總噸數僅在五百高噸左右。日本以進出口貿易爲其經濟命脈，在華北，華中，華　的軍隊，亦須不斷接濟，以全部商船維持軍需，已覺捉襟見肘了。</p>
<p>從日本木土釗澳洲或新西蘭的距離，都在四千英里以上。日本要增加商船　位，往來其間，以運送十五個師團，携帶戰車，大砲，運輸車輛，和飛機，勢所不能。</p>
<p>所以就事論事，日本的加入戰團，僅有牽制作用。英國在印度洋和西太平洋的商業，無疑的將受阻碍。但同時日本自身與荷屬東印，澳洲印度等地不可或缺的貿易，亦將一朝盡付東流了。</p>
<p>現在美國已禁止飛機汽油和廢鐵運往日本。中國鐵礦產量不多，質地窳劣日本要取得煤油祇有回荷屬東印，要鐵，祇有尙澳洲印度。還有極關重要的就是　洲的羊毛，供給亦將斷絕。日本海外貿易，有半數左右依靠中立國的運輸，屆時亦將喪失無餘。</p>
<p>英國以大西洋和加勒比海各島租借與美國，作爲國防根據地。在日本人看來，含有重大意義。假使美國海軍眞能自由利用柏摩大和耶馬加等海港，必要時自然也可以利用新加坡的第一流海　船塢和兵工廠及設備優良的澳洲雪梨軍港。其中意義自必更加重大了。（譯紐約　Herald　Tifuen特稿）</p>
<p>（）二</p>
<p>日本經過近衛內閣一次「上層革命」之後，已很順利的變成一極樺國。其實行全國資源總動昌，固然是對華作戰三年無結果的影響，也是採取新外交方針後的必然趨勢。</p>
<p>日本今日所處的地位，是以前所料想不到的，要明白個中眞相，必須何溯到三個月前的情形。日本軍部曾決定兩個政策，一是三國同盟，一是極權政治。本年七月間，日本軍部曾向政府提出節略，主張對外加緊與軸心國結合，對內加强國家機構，米內內閣卽因拒絕這項建議而傾覆。倘使加以最後分析，則日本對內的新機構，和對外的新陣容，都是因爲發見非採取根本改革，不能結束對華戰爭，拔出泥足。所以日本第一個目的，還是以結束對華戰事爲主。</p>
<p>日本局勢這樣急轉直下，也是受今夏歐　劇變的影響。荷蘭與法國被征服後，日本野心，亦因之自動擴大，「大　亞主義」已代替了一向高唱入雲的「日滿支三國集團」，在短短的三價月內，日本已捨棄了他五十年來所遵守的政治經濟系統了。</p>
<p>日本兵力固然不容輕視，其海軍，在噸位和砲火威力方面，也可與美國相頡頏。據東京眾事專家說，日本艦隊在地理上佔據優勢，可以增强其攻擊力量，若取守勢，實　上堪稱無敵。合日本原有三島和後來取得的島嶼，日本帝國已成爲東亞沿海一道堅固的堤防，目白令海峽起，直至東京灣爲止，南洋代管各島，凸出有如屏障，似可稱覇西太平洋。</p>
<p>美國在這種情形之下，常然不擬進攻日本。日本方面亦不擬攻擊美國。可是美國若決定積極抗德，不顧三國協定中的第三條，日本政府的地位，便不免陷入困難。日本若悍然進攻美國，非特招致國內物議，目將不得小放棄其緊强的防禦地位，而遠離根據地作戰。</p>
<p>至於三國協定的目標，本　欲使美國艦隊留駐太平洋，或至少不參加歐戰，這顯然是德國間接援助日本建設「東亞新秩序」的交換條件。</p>
<p>日本今日的戰略，在使中國失去戰鬬力，以結束對華戰事。日本海軍，已在中國沿海加緊封鎖，其海軍飛機已使重慶化爲灰燼。重慶和外界的交通　綫，多被他關斷。佔領越南，不獨封閉了法國口岸，且可以此作爲截斷滇緬公路的出發點。日本並想運用德國勢力，勸誘斯太林關閉中國軍火接濟的最後路綫（這點已經失敗）</p>
<p>日本認爲這些卽可以兌現的資產，具有和歐洲軸心國訂立同盟的充分價値。可是一方爲資產，一方面卽是負債。日本和德　兩國的經濟聯繫，較共對英美兩國所必需的貿易，實在是渺小得可笑。</p>
<p>因此日本所成立的新同盟，雖有種種表面上的利益，實際上却是一種賭博。日本所孤注的是德國小待英國發揮全部實力及美國的援助便可在歐洲獲勝。她所猜的是美國因爲一無凖備，祇能嚴守中立，坐待德國完成目標。然而盟的中的第三條，一旦實行，日本必將大感棘手。戰爭將毀滅日本的對美貿易，日本在不列顚帝國內的商塲，亦將連根拔去。至於另覓巿塲和別闢來源，祇不過存在「新秩序」的紙面上。日本每一個家庭和每一種工業，都要感覺戰爭的影響。日本旣斷送了有利的國外貿易，「東亞新秩序」便紙有散播着窮困。假使央美海軍在太平洋上實行合作，日本所獲得的利益，更將如同散沙，無法鞏固了。（譯紐的泰唔十報十月五白東京無錢電）</p>

<p>— 黃林</p>
<p>膽大又要心細，道話怎樣講呢？在表面看來，是矛盾的，不可能的；小朋友也一定以爲要膽大，就不能心細，要心細，就不可膽大。這都因爲我們誤解了膽大和心細的意義，沒有明瞭膽大和心細的關係。</p>
<p>我所說的膽大，並不是只靠一時的勇氣一味的蠢動，乃是過到危險的事，不慌張，遇到臨時發牛的事，能隨機應變，卽使在平日有了困難，想法去克服，而出以有目的有計劃的行動，按着步驟一步步的做去。</p>
<p>我所說的心細，並不是事事老慮，怕有障礙，怕不能成功，而不去實行，想逃避現實，乃是臨事處處留意，勿大意，勿疏忽，以减少錯誤，使事業易於達到成功。</p>
<p>所以膽大是實行或應付無論何事的推動力，心細是進行事業應有的注意力，兩者有密切的關係，如果僅　膽大不心細，容易隨時遇到挫所和困難，或不測的危險，如果只是心細不膽大，不能幹大事，不能　付急變。</p>
<p>我們明白了以上的意義和關係，就不　覺得其間的矛盾，反而感覺到對於我們人生是多麼重要，我們處在這瞬息動變的時代中，時時　危險侵襲，時時有巨大的艱難困擾，我們的父母不能時常在旁邊保護着，我們的敎帥不能常常在近旁督促着，如果不膽大，就學得到處造恐懼，如果再不心細，禍害很易發生，對於意外的事變，更不能應付了。</p>
<p>小朋友們，讓我們在平日來訓練自已，無論目瑣屑的小事，以至行路學業上開始，使自己成爲一個膽大心細的時代兒童。</p>
<h3 id="c115">看了「幼年安迪生」　影片後的話 <a href="#c115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>— 蘇明</p>
<p>在上星期日的上午，庸兒的父親帶了伸們兄弟倆到大華電影院去看　幼年安迪生　的影片。庸兒本來是不大喜歡看　影的，往往在黑暗的電影院中打瞌睡，可是道一次看了這張影片之後，倒提起了他的興趣，便一口氣看完了這張影片，絲毫不覺疲倦。在返家途中，他更要求他父親時時帶他去看電影，他父親使對他說道：「像這種影片是最配你們兒童的胃口，而目是値得使你們一看的，不過你們今大看了這張影片，有些什麼感想？要是沒有的話，那我下回不帶你們出來看了。</p>
<p>「有的，有的，」庸兒搶先說，這是他希望下回再出來看電影的緣故。「安迪生那個孩子是再頑皮也沒有了，爸爸，我們雖頑皮，但還不及他哩。他讀書不用功，在學校裹闖禍，被舉校裏開除出來，這些我也沒有。然而安迪生對他母親倒是很孝順的，當他一聽到母親生病的消肩，便立刻趕回家裏，　助醫生行手術，竟虧他想得出用許多火油燈合併起來的光綫，從一面鏡子裏反射到母親的牀邊，使醫生便於開刀，他眞聰明極了。而且他又　與敢，像去搶救火車中旅　　性命，要是我到了那時，眞是要急死了。這也是我不及他的地方，爸爸，你以爲對嗎？」</p>
<p>「你說得不錯，好，再讓你哥哥說罷。」</p>
<p>「安迪生幼年的　遇是再壞也沒有了，被人家看不起，並日罵他有神經病的孩子，然而他並不因此而灰心，依舊在地下室裹研究他的科學玩意，他更喜歡工作，他一面在火車上做個販賣糖果　紙的小販，一面還在火車上研究科學，後來竟自己印刷，自已編輯，自己推銷他的報紙，這種工作是多麼辛苦！然而他並不覺得艱難，反以爲很有興趣，這種精神是値得我們佩服的。」</p>
<p>「你說得也很好，最後由我來講，你們聽着：安迪牛雖是個頑皮的孩子，然而他很聽他母親的話，被學校開除之後，他便自修補習，而他母親更時常加以指尊，所以安迪生的學問，一半由他母親的訓導而得到的，以致他成了個科學偉人，所以你們倆對於母親的詁，應當聽從。安迪生能獲明各　東四，像電燈，電影，電話，留聲機，等等，是不知遭遇到名少次的困難，障碍糾失敗，然而他能忍耐，有恒心的去研究其中失敗的原因，使一而再，再而三的改良，以致能得到最後的成功。他研究科學，不是用讀死書的力法，是用　種實騐來柿救科學研究的不足，而且他在工作時，總常常的想，且不斷　加以實騐，在事實上是不是和書本上吿訴我們的互相符合，如果一發生不符合的事情，便研究其中不符合的緣故，這樣的研究才有效力。你們通常却都患這毛病，總以爲書本上所講述的是千準萬確，於是不用腦子去想，更不再去實騐了，這　的讀書，進步是很有限的。你們倆今天所講的感想還算好，我下回再帶你們看偉人安迪生」，可以知道安迪生在壯年時代是怎樣的努力研究，以致他對於全世界有這種極偉大的貢獻！</p>
<h3 id="c116">沒有寒衣的苦孩子 <a href="#c116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>— 影</p>
<p>天氣已交到寒冬，氣候正在一天大的冷起來，寒衣楚每一個人都需要啦！然而在上海這都巿裏面，正有着小少人們，到現在，身上還沒有寒衣。允其是有許多貧苦兒童，寒衣問題還沒有解決呢！這是多麼可憐啊！一般的兒童，大衣，絨綫衫，都已穿在身上，可是那些貧苦兒童，不是穿着單薄的夏衣，就是遮些麻袋，席爿之類，當做禦寒的東西。無情的西北風，要是再緊逼下去，他們將會過不得這個冬天了啊！</p>
<p>有衣服穿的人是不會知道沒衣服穿的人的苦痛的。前幾决的大冷，不楚每一次有好多無家可歸的人倒斃在馬路上嗎？這些倒斃的人，雖然也有因別種原故的，但受凍挨冷至少也是一大原因。成人旣是這樣，兒童富然也不　例外。如果寒衣問題不解決，這一個冬天當然會有無數貧苦兒童因凍餒而死。兒童是未來的國家主人翁，枉死一個兒童，使國家多損失一分原氣，所以這問題是相當嚴重而急待解決的！</p>
<p>好吧？現在中華慈幼協會上海分事務所，已發起徵募難童寒衣運動。中華慈幼協會，也許每一個小朋友都知道，是中國唯一的慈幼機關。「八一三」後，雖撤往內地，但在上海還是設有分事務所，進行各種慈幼工作。造福貧苦兒童，眞是不淺。關於難童寒衣，過去他們已舉辦過多决，把寒衣捐募到之後，就製成棉衣褲，分發給各區的貧苦兒童，如難童，流浪兒童，和貧民區兒章等。不過在百物昂貴的今日，做一套棉衣褲，已今非昔比，棉花要兩元一斤。去年一套棉衣褲　兩元，今年要六元。所以捐款的需要，也甚於往年。所望的一般小朋友們能够把各種不需要的費用，節省下來，踴躍捐助。除了捐款之外，舊寒衣也需要，現在有許多學生，已開始徵募了。望沒有參加的小朋友，快些捐助，俾可救活些貧苦兒童，眞是造福不淺里！</p>

<p>我在火奴魯魯又得到了許許多多禮物，幾乎使我不能把數學中的算法來算了。內中有一偭個黑頭髮的中國和日本玩偶有一個個穿着草裙的檀島玩偶，有一箱箱的糖菓，有一頂頂彩虹幻作五色的陽傘，有一把把的羽扇紙屬，有踏浪的滑板，有家裏穿的拖鞋，此外更有種種色色的東西。檀島的卡哈努摩古公爵，在我一副踏浪的滑板上簽上了他的名宇，替我祝福。他是一位很有名很有本領的游泳家。</p>
<p>火奴魯魯的海軍官員們，帶我到他們泊在港口的戰艦上去玩。給我穿上一身白色的制服，稱我爲「秀蘭副少將」。我又在章几几海灘上，學會了眞的草裙舞，是多麼的有趣呢！</p>
<p>可甘，我在檀島上正很快樂的時候却接到了一個悲哀的消息。原來那大明星可憐的威爾羅吉士先生，不幸在阿拉斯加慘死了。他們把電話通知媽媽，我聽了哭個不休。平日間我很愛羅士先生，而媽媽說從此以後，我們冉也不能瞧見他了。（完了）</p>

<p>我的老師　工部局第一臨時小學　周德蘇</p>
<p>我級的任老師，是汪老師，她有圓孔，鬈鬈的頭髪，靈活的會說話的眼睛，走起路來脚步很輕。</p>
<p>每　打過上課鈴後，她就　臉帶着笑容，走來很淸楚地講書，可是有的時候，我們上課後，還在講話，她來了就露出一　嚴肅的面容，默不作聲，這默不作聲是表示汪老師在生氣了，我們大家坐端正，犯規則的同學，更把頭低下去。</p>
<p>汪老師講書，講得很有條理，所以個個同學，都很歡迎在老　講書，在老師講書喜歡用譬解，喜歡請有趣的話，有的時候一句話，說得全級同學都哈哈地笑起來。</p>
<p>我們功課做得好的時候，她便贊美我們，講故事給我們聽，可是我們不用功的時候，她就要責罰我們了。</p>
<p>我們有了錯事，她常開導我們，把事情的原原本本，有條有理的請解給我們聽，使我們知道自己錯的地方而自願改過，但假如有的同　意志不堅定，跟外面的野孩子去玩，往往要二决三决做錯事，那時，她才責罰他們了，但假如那同學肯改過的話，在老師還是原諒柿的。所以我們同學沒有一個不愛在老師，也沒有一個不怕在老師的。我祝福汪老師身體健康，願她永遠做孩子們的明燈。</p>

<p>— 第二名　盛茶</p>
<p>「幼年安迪生影片開始的時候，前面有一篇字幕，說到『這一段勇毅堅忍奮鬭的故事，可以說是美國村城裹任何一個人的遭遇，而這個人恰好是安迪生。」</p>
<p>嚴父的管束，慈母的愛護，學校當局傳　的寡陋，親友鄰居無情的鄙薄，幾乎是每一個偉大人物的必然環境。安迪生以一個弱小的孩童竟懷有濟世的大志，雖然學校功課不在他的。上，但是在地下室裏早晚不倦地硏究實騐，所得的結果，往拌鬧出笑話來，被四鄰所訕笑，甚至目爲瘋在，郎連生　的父親仇難以原諒，幸有一位慈祥的母親來了解他，來安慰他，來鼓勵他，終於成爲世界科學界的首腦，現代文明的大恩人。</p>
<p>不過我們祇要留心一看，便會發覺和安迪生當時同樣年齡的孩童，不論任何國籍，幾乎都有好奇的習性與實騐的興趣：好好一個洋囝囝忽然被他們解剖得身首分離，好好一具時鐘忽然被他們研究得片甲不留，做父親的氣得暴哮如雷，而做母親的雖也可惜天物被殄，却終還能忍耐得下，於是百般勸慰，薄責了事。試問我們碰到這種情景，是不是應當把這個孩童也當作未來的安迪生看待，怪這個父親不諒，稱這位母親爲能理解孩兒的偉大呢？我想假使大家若了這齣「幼年安迪生」，不去細察因果，每個父母都相信家裏出了世界的發明家，每個孩童都自視爲偉大的科學權威；我敢說，在不久的將來，用不到狄人飛機轟炸，眼　得全城烟火升起，瓦礫飛　呢。</p>
<p>所以做父母的看這齣　影，應當每　個極小部份都注　到。要知道安迪生的父親雖然待自己的兄女極爲嚴厲，但是他是在社會上立足，不得不以社會的安全爲前提，他以愛妻的解釋，明知兒子不是一味的胡鬧，但是兒—旣獲罪於衆，他也決不以他爲是天才而輕易放過。听以他威嚴的面具後時常留着莞　的微笑：猛重的鞭撻。不乏溫存的撫弄。這是一位極可愛的模範父親。</p>
<p>安迪生的母親也不祇是一位溺愛子女的無知婦人。她約於兒‘在地下室裏的一舉一動，都仔細地看在眼裏，她明白兒子的好學是有目的的，她知道兒子的實騐是有根據的；所以她的了解安迪生　祇是盲目的母愛，她因女敎員的指斥　發生的狂怒也不　是自私的辯護。若依安迪生的傳記上說，那麽，當安氏退學後，她　親</p>

<p>— 頋明道</p>
<p>絳子聽說做媒兩字，伏在桌上，面孔漲紅了說道：「我不要，我不要，張相公休要說着玩，我将来是要做和尙的。」儒生道：「和尙是出家人，况且沒有女子做和尚。像你這樣傾城傾國的　人，怎容許你去做和尚？天下斷沒有這種殺風景的事。」他說到這裏，又　左首的麗人說道：一如是，你聽你妹妹說的話，豈不奇怪！眞還不脫孩子氣。你們都是美人。哈哈，美人和名士倒是相得益彰呢。麗人把着碧玉小盞，只顧湊　櫻脣上徐徐的喝，面　若有凝思。見儒生向伊說話時，淡淡的說道：「恩師的話，小女子一晌是尊重的，獨是今天說的話却有些不敢苟同了。」儒生聽了這句話，不由一怔道：　怎麽？方纔我的話說錯了嗎？我誇讚你們冰雪聰明，稱道你們是美人，確乎都是由衷之言。不要說這裹松陵一帶地方，就是說江南，若要稱起美人來，非卿莫屬。况你又是我的女弟子，我是深知你們咏絮才華，求之香閨名媛，尚是麟角鳳毛，不可多得，何况章台　呢？如是，你以爲如何？」麗人點點頸道：「多承恩師謬讚，愧不敢當。方纔恩師說大下最難得的是英雄名　美人，而把美人來誇奬我們。其實我們倆蒲柳之姿，自幼命薄，以攻墮身風塵，奉承色笑，午夜自思，惄焉如擣，　得　之以美人？現在的時勢，朝政失紐，天下騷動，眼見中原鼎沸，有陸沉之禍，正要大英雄出來戡亂禦侮，拯期民於塗炭，方可挽救這累卵的頹勢，立不世的奇功。所謂府勢造英雄，英雄當然是可贵的，允其是在今日。至於恩師，當然是江左管夷吾，名士無雙。但小女子以爲斷不可效陶蜻節的歸隱田園，自標亮節。當求如謝東山的陶情絲竹，運籌却敵。吾則皮之不存，毛將焉傅？大厦旣倒，何地處身？雖欲　善其身，也是不可能了。恩師也以爲小女子說得太嚴重嗎？不知忌諱，死罪死罪。」</p>

        <h1>1940.12.08</h1>
<h3 id="e1">Declaration of the Board of Directors of This Company <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Huang Chu Jiu, the founder of this company, was a pioneer in China's new pharmaceutical industry. Decades ago, Mr. Huang, recognizing the urgent need of Chinese people for Western medicines and the huge outflow of capital, established this company with the aim of recovering rights and interests. The greatness of its scale and the thoroughness of its planning have long become an indelible historical fact in the new pharmaceutical industry. Unfortunately, Mr. Huang passed away before completing his grand undertaking. Unwilling to sit idly by and watch this hard-earned great cause be ruined in one fell swoop, we, his colleagues, raised funds to take over the company and reorganized it. We thought that with everyone's agreement, the established rules could be continued. However, difficulties arose at every step, and disagreements emerged. Like people in the same boat during a storm, we were ashamed, and eventually parted ways. Fortunately, after enduring hardships, we became more determined and strived to overcome difficulties. We are also grateful for the kind care and encouragement from all sectors, which allowed this company to develop step by step and flourish. In 1934, we added a medical and pharmaceutical department, and in 1937, we established a nutritional food department, achieving our current status and glory. The reputation and achievements of all this company's exports are well known to all sectors, so there is no need to elaborate further. However, this company has always held two major principles in the production of pharmaceuticals. First, the aim is to recover the outflow of capital, not to compete fiercely with peers for profit. Therefore, the products of this company are all aimed at meeting the urgent needs of the Chinese people, with the goal of creating products not already available domestically. The most notable examples are "Bulito" and "Lakoufu" malted milk, which were pioneering creations in the domestic Western medicine industry when they were first launched. This is evident to all. Our intention is not to show off or be pretentious, but to adhere to the principle of recovering rights and interests and to avoid unnecessary competition with peers, which would be ridiculed by foreigners. Second, the raw materials used in this company's pharmaceutical products are of the highest quality, and the efficacy is guaranteed to be accurate. Experts are hired to conduct specialized testing, and we never attempt to reduce costs by deceiving ourselves and others. The ingredients must undergo strict inspection to avoid misleading others and ourselves. The above two points are the principles that this company will always uphold. This company deeply understands that the mission of the new pharmaceutical industry is significant and cannot be compared to ordinary businesses. The launch of each product has a profound impact on social health. Any negligence will make us sinners against society and humanity. The colleagues of this company always maintain a sense of caution, and we are extremely careful in the production of our products, adhering to the principle of "better to have nothing than to have substandard goods," and we dare not be greedy for more or seek novelty. This is what the colleagues of this company can be proud of, and it is also well known to society. Now, on the occasion of the third anniversary of the launch of Lakoufu malted milk and the completion of the new giant machinery installation, we humbly announce this and hope that</p>
<p>Our compatriots and talents will provide guidance from time to time, which would be a great honor for this company and a great prospect for the new pharmaceutical industry.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Lakoufu in the Words of Doctors <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>— Du He</p>
<p>If a person cannot even believe in himself, who else can he hope to believe in him? No one will believe in him. Then, what else can this person do? This applies to individuals, and by extension, it also applies to a country and a nation.</p>
<p>However, Chinese people have always been reluctant to trust Chinese goods. In the past, almost everything was better if it was imported. It was only through the efforts of people in the national goods industry, using facts to correct this distorted mentality, that things slowly began to change. The reputation of national goods has been rising day by day. Everyone understands that the quality of national goods is no worse than that of imported goods. However, to be honest, it seems that a strong sense of confidence has not yet been established in the medical and pharmaceutical sector. When people get sick and need medicine or injections, it is naturally something that cannot be easily experimented with. Doctors are unwilling to experiment, and patients dare not experiment—success has always been achieved through experimentation. Without experimentation, it is difficult to make progress. Therefore, in this sector, the final victory still requires the efforts of all parties.</p>
<p>One day, at a gathering at a doctor's house, I suddenly heard someone ask the doctor, "It's getting cold, what should we eat?" The doctor blurted out, "Something like Lakoufu is very good." The person then asked, "Is it about the same as foreign goods?" The doctor replied, "They are made of the same raw materials, so the effectiveness is naturally about the same. Why spend more money?" I know that the doctor has no connection with Jiufu. So, his recommendation of Lakoufu is certainly reliable. Therefore, I have gained trust in Lakoufu, or at least, my doubts have been dispelled.</p>
<p>I think that everyone values their own life, and that is undoubtedly true. Therefore, needles and medicines used for treatment should not be casually recommended. However, tonics are clearly different from needles and medicines, so why be overly superstitious about imported goods? Moreover, with a doctor recommending it, it is evident that this product is more reliable, so why not give it a try? Success has always been achieved through experimentation!</p>
<p>Forgive me for not being able to say how good Lakoufu is. Because excessive exaggeration is not only useless but also harmful to the facts. All I dare to say is what the doctor said: "Something like Lakoufu is very good."</p>
<h3 id="e3">Ode to Jiufu <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Kongwo</p>
<p>Jiufu Company, a pioneer in the pharmaceutical industry, initially laid the foundation, thanks to Mr. Huang Chu Jiu.</p>
<p>Domestically produced Western medicine, a wake-up call for society, foresight, and followed by peers.</p>
<p>The giant star suddenly fell, the grand undertaking unfinished, relying on many talents, seeking common ground.</p>
<p>Collective wisdom and effort, loyalty to the cause, product quality improving daily, reputation growing daily.</p>
<p>Like Bulito, like England, word-of-mouth praises, praise abounds.</p>
<p>Progressing daily, difficult to confine, created Lakoufu, the champion of tonics.</p>
<p>Strengthening the body and brain, improving intelligence and enlightenment, better taste than delicacies, more effective than ginseng.</p>
<p>Superior to imported goods, ingenious workmanship, spreads like wildfire, agile as a swimming dragon.</p>
<p>For three years now, universally admired, wholesale and retail, snatched up empty.</p>
<p>Increased purchase of giant machinery, further expansion, recovering capital outflow, consistently pursuing initial aspirations.</p>
<p>Reviving our decline, benefiting even the humble, joyful and praying, boundless blessings.</p>

<p>— Li Haoran</p>
<p>A cup of rich fragrance, drunk and full. The aftertaste quenches thirst and brings clarity.</p>
<p>From now on, I no longer envy Western dew. The finest nectar in China is the most delicious.</p>
<h3 id="e5">Praise to Lakoufu <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>— Zhou Shoujuan</p>
<p>Jiufu Company makes Lakoufu malted milk from cocoa, wheat extract, milk, and cheese. Its color, aroma, and taste are all excellent. People with minor ailments drink it daily and find it delicious, praising it as unparalleled.</p>
<p>Cocoa, wheat extract, and cheese. The flavor is naturally delightful.</p>
<p>Fine nectar and jade liquid, the pleasure of immortals. Lakoufu is now enjoyed by people in the world.</p>
<p>When there's a minor illness, the pharmacy flies a dragon banner. In the boudoir, the curtains are drawn all day.</p>
<p>Pity her thin bones after eating fragrant peaches. Gladly, she gets a cup of fairy brew.</p>
<h3 id="e6">Infinite Good Fortune <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>— Jiang Zongyi</p>
<p>On this dark and isolated island, people are extremely lonely. Occasionally, drinking a few cups of strong coffee can be exciting, but the stimulation is always followed by a sleepless night. Thoughts surge like a thousand waves, unstoppable. So, while strong coffee is delicious, its excessive stimulation of the nerves is a drawback.</p>
<p>However, since learning that Jiufu Company produces Lakoufu malted milk, I have replaced coffee with it. Because it has the rich flavor of coffee, as well as the power of nourishment and invigoration, without the excessive stimulation of coffee. Not only does it not have a strong stimulating effect on the nerves, but it also has a sleep-inducing effect. Therefore, after extreme mental exertion, drinking a cup of Lakoufu immediately invigorates me, and I can also get enough sleep at night. So, in fact, I have greatly improved my health. If we interpret "Le" as "good," then Lakoufu is good fortune. And my being able to drink Lakoufu regularly is precisely my good fortune. Now, in addition to Lakoufu malted milk, Jiufu Company has also launched Lakoufu nutritional biscuits. I heard that they are also planning to launch Lakoufu nutritional candies in the future, which can truly be said to be infinite good fortune and infinite happiness.</p>
<h3 id="e7">My Impression of Lakoufu <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>— Qi Hua</p>
<p>Recently, many people have lamented the influx of foreign goods and the decline of national goods, as if consumers were born with a slavish mentality of admiring foreign things. However, the development of this mentality is the joint responsibility of manufacturers and consumers. Consumers are greedy for cheapness, and manufacturers produce shoddy goods, resulting in products that appear good on the surface but are actually scams.</p>
<p>I often think that this mistake must be corrected. Manufacturers must produce goods conscientiously, and consumers must also open their eyes. For example, when imitating foreign goods, at least imitate them so that they are consistent inside and out, and the price should be reduced as much as possible, but not so low that it requires cutting corners. I often talk about this idea with my friends, because I am often sick and take medicine almost every other day, and "imported" tonics are too expensive to afford. I desperately hope that there are national goods that can be bought as replacements.</p>
<p>This Mid-Autumn Festival, a friend sent me several cans of Lakoufu malted milk and Lakoufu biscuits. The friend said, "Don't underestimate them. The color, aroma, and taste are all the same as genuine 'imported' goods. You often suffer from insomnia, so drink a cup before bed, or have it as a snack in the morning, and that would be great."</p>
<p>I didn't pay much attention to it when I heard it. At night, I still listlessly lay on the chair as usual, but my wife brewed a cup of Lakoufu. Smiling, she handed it to me. The hot aroma rushed straight into my nose, and I suddenly felt refreshed. She went and got two biscuits. I drank and ate, and found them to be fragrant, sweet, and crunchy. I really enjoyed it. So, that night I had a comfortable and sound sleep, but I still thought it was somewhat of a psychological effect. Later, it was like this for several days in a row, and I was energetic and optimistic in everything. I am convinced that Lakoufu really has a calming and brain-boosting effect, and it is especially suitable for neurasthenia. To be honest, I used to be superstitious about foreign tonics. I thought that if I couldn't afford foreign goods, then I would rather not buy them, because most Chinese products are unreliable. Now that "Lakoufu" has been launched, my biased views have naturally been eliminated. I thank Jiufu Company. They not only sell the same quality as foreign goods at a lower price, but also, due to such genuine value for money, they have also corrected the general public's mentality of being superstitious about foreign goods.</p>
<p>Now, due to the fact that Lakoufu is in greater demand than supply, Jiufu Company has purchased the latest Swiss machinery and is preparing for mass production, striving for perfection. I heard a few days ago that they are going to publish a commemorative special issue to promote "Lakoufu," so I am very happy to write this short article, because I, who have always suffered from neurasthenia, have become energetic since taking Lakoufu. The birth and popularity of "Lakoufu," its significance is far beyond what ordinary people call "business development." It has made the greatest and best contribution to the health of the people!</p>
<h3 id="e8">Color, Aroma, and Taste are All Excellent <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>— Feng Mengyun</p>
<p>Last month, Jiufu Company hosted a banquet and gave me two cans of Lakoufu malted milk and two cans of nutritional biscuits. I took them home for my wife and children. The biscuits were eaten up by my children in a day or two. I drink the malted milk before going to bed, and I always feel that its fragrance is clear and refreshing, unlike any other drink. Moreover, there is absolutely no sediment, which is why it is so valuable.</p>
<p>Jiufu Company has the longest history among the new pharmaceutical companies. The founder was Mr. Huang Chu Jiu. At that time, Mr. Huang invented a type of Bai Ling Ji, which was famous at the time for its "unexpected efficacy." Later, Bulito was launched, and its reputation became even higher. It was even regarded as the top tonic in the market, and to this day, no other tonic has been able to compete with Bulito. The name of Jiufu Company also became famous because of the strong sales of Bulito. Since then, every product launched by Jiufu Company has become popular, all thanks to the successful sales of Bulito.</p>
<p>Lakoufu malted milk is the most powerful of the new products launched by Jiufu Company in recent years. Now, a new neon light stands tall on Yu Qiaqing Road, attracting the attention of passersby. Its sales are increasing day by day, which can be predicted. The writer has been drinking it for more than a month and is willing to use the six words "Color, aroma, and taste are all excellent" to make a definitive assessment.</p>
<h3 id="e9">I Love Lakoufu <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>— Zhou Tianlai</p>
<p>I am a person who makes a living by writing. I rack my brains every day of the year, writing while using cigarettes to help my thoughts. I know it's useless, but I have no substitute. I don't like candy or snacks. Every night, I often feel dry tongue and lips, and mentally exhausted. Recently, a friend advised me to drink Lakoufu malted milk produced by Jiufu Company. I drink a cup every night after finishing my writing debts, and it is indeed delicious, quenches thirst, and refreshes the mind, losing the previous fatigue. I also add a few Lakoufu nutritional biscuits, which are filling, thirst-quenching, and comforting to the body and mind. I am grateful for my friend's sincere recommendation, and I also admire the excellent products of Jiufu Company, which are comparable to imported products of the same nature. I heard that the company has recently imported the latest machinery to manufacture it, further striving for perfection. It is truly the light of national goods, and it is precisely my "good fortune" without end. Now, even my children love to drink Lakoufu malted milk, especially my six-month-old daughter, who eats five Lakoufu biscuits a day. This is a fact.</p>
<h3 id="e10">From Lakoufu Biscuits to a Father-Son Debate <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>— Xue Xi</p>
<p>One day, I and several gentlemen, including Kongwo and Yifang Mengyun, were eating together. Because I was arguing with someone in the newspaper about the issue of father and son, our conversation unintentionally turned to this issue as well. My view is that all parents love their children, so children should also be filial to their parents. My argument is based on seeing how my wife takes care of our children, using all her heart and suffering all the hardships, which makes me think of my parents in the past, who also tried their best and placed so much hope on their children. So my position is that children, seeing how they love their own children, cannot forget to love their parents as much as they love their own children. At that time, I had just bought two cans of Lakoufu biscuits, preparing to take them back for Yiyang to eat, so I pointed to the biscuits to prove the parents' love for their children. Mengyun, however, thought that what I said was wrong. He said that children are fundamentally unreliable, so parents don't need to have any hope for their children. But I always feel that although parents don't expect their children to repay them, children cannot help but do their best to repay even a fraction of the profound kindness of their parents. Kongwo looked at my biscuits and smiled: "I once said that it's better to sell children's toys than to open a shop selling tonics for the elderly." This remark is very subtle and meaningful, which means that after all, there are more people in the world who love their children than those who respect their parents. I was also thinking in my heart that if my parents were still alive, I might not be able to buy some tonics for them to take, but now I hear that Jiufu Company's Lakoufu nutritional biscuits are made of the finest biscuit ingredients with the addition of the right amount of Lakoufu malted milk, and are refined according to scientific methods. They contain protein, fat, and various vitamins A, B, C, and D. They are really the most suitable and nourishing food for children, and they are also delicious and filling. I hurriedly bought two cans to take back, which is enough to show the parents' concern and love for their children. Because of this, how can children neglect and disappoint the painstaking efforts of their parents? Yifang has always been very careless about everything, but when he heard that Lakoufu nutritional biscuits are a boon for children, he asked about the price and said that he also wanted to buy two cans. I nodded and smiled, which is also proof of parents' love for their children. I record this incident as a digression from the father-son debate. I hope that people who have children will read this article and know that Lakoufu nutritional biscuits are a boon for children, but at the same time, I hope that people who have parents will also be able to finish reading this article so that they know the parents' love for their children.</p>
<h3 id="e11">A Blessing in Sickness <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>— Ying Ning Gongzi</p>
<p>Lakoufu malted milk is one of the products of Jiufu Company. Many of my friends take Lakoufu. I usually don't like to take tonics very much, so I haven't tried it. However, I know that Lakoufu malted milk has been able to take the place of imported goods in recent years. Therefore, although I don't eat this stuff, I have a good impression of it when people mention Lakoufu, because it can defeat foreign goods, which should recover a lot of capital outflow for the country. Recently, I suffered from illness for a few days, which is the so-called dengue fever. I am a person who lives alone, and no one asks about soup and medicine when I am sick, so I entered the International Sanatorium. The sanatorium provides patients with three meals a day, and there is also a snack in the afternoon, which is Lakoufu malted milk and Lakoufu biscuits. When I was sick, my mouth felt very bitter, and I needed sweet drinks to regulate it. Lakoufu malted milk and biscuits suited my taste. Not only did I recognize it as the only blessing in my sickness, but now that I am well, I still drink Lakoufu malted milk every day, because in the past I only had a good impression of it, but now it has become my favorite. I never expected to form this relationship with Lakoufu because of illness, and the hospital also uses Lakoufu as a snack for patients, which shows that this stuff is really a tonic that is beneficial to life.</p>
<h3 id="e12">Lakoufu Can Repel Ghosts <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>— Chushi</p>
<p>Some people may be shocked to see this title. Lakoufu is a nutritional product, not a talisman of Zhang Tianshi, so how can it repel ghosts? Isn't this alarmist talk? I say, this is not a lie at all, it is entirely true, and let me slowly explain.</p>
<p>Last winter, I made a decision to ask a doctor to adjust my body, but in the process of adjusting, I became a physically weak person. When I did things, I was listless, and when I raised my head, golden blowflies flew around like singing orioles. When I ate, I had no taste at all, and everything became dull and boring.</p>
<p>It was probably the third day of the lunar new year this year. I had nothing to do at night, so I went to bed early. The lights were not turned off. When I woke up, a headless woman suddenly stood in front of my bed, standing still. I thought to myself, in the middle of the night, why is there such an uninvited female guest? Could it be that the fox spirit mentioned in the Liaozhai has come? At that time, I was not afraid, but instead opened my eyes wide to see clearly. I saw the woman slowly shortening, shrinking smaller and smaller, and eventually disappearing without a trace.</p>
<p>The next day at the newspaper office, I told the story of seeing a ghost the night before. Everyone said, "Where are there any ghosts? Maybe you are too nervous, so you have to find a doctor to see." I thought that this was reasonable, so I asked a doctor, who also determined that it was neurasthenia. In addition to taking some medicine, he also told me to take Lakoufu often, because Lakoufu has special effects in treating brain marrow deficiency and neurasthenia. I listened to the doctor's words, bought two cans of Lakoufu, and after taking it, my spirit was greatly boosted, and I could sleep at night. From then on, I regarded Lakoufu as my regular food. Now, my body is getting fatter every day, with a big belly, and I have never seen a ghost again at night. With this said, isn't Lakoufu able to repel ghosts? I think, if friends are afraid of being haunted by living ghosts, everyone should eat more cans of Lakoufu to maintain their health and righteousness.</p>
<h3 id="e13">On Lakoufu Malted Milk <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>— Dalang</p>
<p>Since the launch of Lakoufu malted milk, its sales have been so strong that, according to surveys, the ratio of it to imported goods is 3,000 to 150. Seeing the strong sales of domestic nutritional products, I know that the producers did not waste their huge investment in plugging the capital outflow, which is gratifying. For the past one or two months, I have been taking this product without interruption. I am physically weak and take tonics all year round, but I do not persist, stopping after ten days or a month. The only reason I have been eating Lakoufu without getting tired of it is because it excels in color, aroma, and taste. I eat a meal of it in the morning, mixing it with a raw egg, and another meal before bed, adding a little milk. The method may not be compliant with the rules, but it is very sweet to eat, so it has become a habit. I once got a sentence when I was idly chanting in the Ming Lou: "I once bothered Su Shou to learn how to make soup, the color and fragrance are combined, and the taste is mellow. A cup is offered to Lang, it should be cherished, and I wish him a long life because of his good fortune." A woman in the boudoir also likes this, so there is this sentence.</p>
<h3 id="e14">Self-Introduction of Our Company <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>— Factory Director Hu Zhenhan, Pharmacist</p>
<p>Jiu Fu Pharmaceutical Company was established in the twelfth year of the Republic of China, and eighteen years have passed since then. It was originally founded solely by the late pharmaceutical tycoon Huang Chujiu. At that time, medical science was flourishing day by day, but medicines were mostly imported from abroad. Mr. Huang felt ashamed of this and gathered elites from both the medical and pharmaceutical fields to painstakingly create this factory. Its products were initially known to the world for Bainianji tonic and Bulido. The company's reputation grew day by day. Unfortunately, the original founder passed away suddenly in the nineteenth year of the Republic of China, and the factory's operations almost came to a standstill. The following year, the founders of our company, recognizing the great significance of Jiu Fu to national health and industry, raised funds to take over the company and reorganized it into a limited liability company. With a focus on innovation, business progressed daily. New-style machinery is added every year in order to improve the quality of products. At the same time, we have made every effort to expand the scope of manufacturing in order to meet social needs. In addition to the raw material and pharmaceutical manufacturing department, which is currently being planned and established, we have now established a research department and a manufacturing department. The manufacturing department includes a pharmaceutical department and a nourishing food department. We also pay attention to the investigation and research of raw materials. The existing equipment can be said to be quite complete. The research department is equipped with a chemical laboratory, a biological assay laboratory, a hydrogen ion concentration measurement room, an ultraviolet light room, a photography room, an animal room, and an organ dissection room. The manufacturing department has a pill-making machine, a tablet-making machine, a combination machine, a vacuum immersion machine, an electric grinder, an alkalization machine, a super-powered centrifuge, a constant-temperature electric dryer, a pressure filter, a vacuum distillation machine, a milling machine, a mixing machine, an ice-making machine, a centrifugal separator, a centrifugal crystallization machine, an ampoule sterilizer, a centrifugal serum clarification machine, a vacuum ampoule filling machine, a vacuum dryer, a vacuum evaporator, etc. The nourishing food section includes a malted milk extract and biscuit and candy manufacturing department, and a malted milk essence manufacturing department. Newly imported giant machines from Switzerland have an extremely complex overall structure and must go through more than ten procedures each time to complete the production of loose, easily soluble, and completely tasteless light yellow granules. From manufacturing to packaging, everything is done by machinery, absolutely without human contact, and it is especially clean and hygienic. The biscuit and candy department is equipped with an electric milling machine, a steam mixing machine, a can-making machine, a screening machine, a packaging machine, a constant-temperature electric oven, a kneading machine, a rolling mill, an automatic biscuit making machine, etc. In terms of products, pharmaceuticals are divided into prescription drugs and medical drugs. Proprietary medicines include Bainianji, Jiu Fu Milk White Cod Liver Oil, Sheng Dan, Bainian Oil, Qianliyan Eye Drops, etc. Medical drugs include Gager, Spleen Su, Indumon, Appin, Itasu, Buxieduo, Bulido, Laike Ding, Maeskemeng, Adick Meng, Linaofu, Jiashimeng, etc. The nourishing food department includes Lekoufu Malted Milk Essence, Lekoufu Nourishing Biscuits, Lekoufu Nourishing Toffee, Qiaosheng Guo, etc., which are manufactured according to nutritional principles and have the effect of nourishing and strengthening the body. There are many other items still under research. All products of our company are manufactured with precision and care, and their efficacy is magnificent. We are very grateful for the trust of the medical community and the popularity of patients. As for the manufacture of drugs, it must go through a thorough scientific inspection and manufacturing process and potency determination of finished products. There is proper management, and the personnel responsible for this work have all undergone scientific training in pharmacognosy, chemistry, pharmacology, and biology, and devote their full time to work. Moreover, all raw materials, whether they are crude drugs or organic and inorganic chemical drugs, must undergo scientific inspection when they enter the factory, and their identity and purity are inspected one by one. Only those that meet the standards are adopted. After the drugs are manufactured, they must undergo various inspections, and special attention is paid to quality and efficacy. However, the essence of science lies in the pursuit of perfection, and there is no limit to the development of business. Our colleagues will certainly work harder to live up to the expectations of the community. Unfortunately, incidents have occurred frequently in recent years. When Bulido was first launched, foreign merchants used their power to obstruct it, and competitors took the opportunity to attack it. However, justice is in the hearts of the people, and facts speak louder than words. Bulido still became popular without advertising, and sales are increasing day by day. Today, it and Lekoufu Malted Milk Essence are the two major contributions of our company. It is beneficial to the health of citizens and is an outstanding tonic. Everyone praises it. We hope that medical and pharmaceutical seniors and sages from all walks of life will give us advice from time to time so that all improvements can be followed. We look forward to it.</p>

<p>London　Chinese Ambassador Guo Taiqi continued yesterday to consult with the Minister in Charge Atlee and Chancellor of the Exchequer Wood on the matter of financial aid to China. The Chinese side believes that because the British government lacks someone to preside over it, the progress of this negotiation will inevitably be somewhat frustrated. Yesterday's consultation was only preliminary, and the exact amount of the loan is still unknown. However, it is widely believed that the amount should be around 10 million pounds. The British Treasury previously lent China 5 million pounds in 1938 to stabilize Chinese finance. This decision should continue to provide funds, but still take cautious steps to prevent the Japanese from speculating and profiting from it. The new loan may also have an important feature, namely that Britain may negotiate with China to purchase military supplies and raw materials on credit, and the purchasing location will not be limited to Britain itself. All countries with a pound-based system will be included. Regarding this matter, Britain has exchanged views with its overseas territories and invited them to cooperate in assisting China.

Export permits for this item must first be verified that there is absolutely no danger of direct or indirect transfer to enemy countries before they can be issued. The shipper must also provide a guarantee that the item will not be transferred to other countries after it arrives at its destination. As for scrap nickel, it can be transferred, but the quantity is very small and not important. (Reuters dispatch on the 7th)</p>
<p>Tokyo　Today's editorial in the Hochi Shimbun criticized the United States' decision to lend China 100 million yuan, saying that this kind of loan is a direct challenge to Japan. This move is tantamount to bombing the foundation for establishing a new order in East Asia and causing an unforgettable unpleasant impression among the Japanese people. At this time, Japan should strengthen its relations with the Axis powers on the one hand and adjust its relations with the Soviet Union as soon as possible. (Reuters dispatch on the 7th)</p>
<p>Lyon　The "Times" recently published an editorial with a commentary on the situation in the Far East. The article stated, "Since Britain is at war with Germany, it is difficult to take care of the East, and it must follow the lead of the United States. Although Japan has strongly reacted to the United States' loan of 100 million US dollars to the Chinese Nationalist Government, it still maintains normal diplomatic relations with the United States. At this moment, there is no worrying sign that a major entanglement will occur between the United States and Japan in the short term. As far as the Soviet Union is concerned, Soviet Ambassador to the United States Uyansky recently held talks with US State Department officials, and the talks mainly focused on the situation in the Far East. However, relations between Japan and the Soviet Union have eased and are continuing to progress. Japanese newspapers generally say that various outstanding issues between Japan and the Soviet Union, such as the exchange of raw materials, the supply of coal and kerosene, and fishing rights, can be quickly resolved under conditions that are beneficial to both parties. In short, Japan seems to have decided to make full use of the German-Italian-Japanese alliance, and its attitude in the Far East will be clarified in the short term," etc. (Havas dispatch on the 6th)</p>

<p>There Are Signs of Another Change in the Japanese Cabinet</p>
<p>Given the current situation, the new Japanese Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Tatekawa, may not have the opportunity to promote Japanese-Soviet rapprochement, and Berlin's failure to persuade Moscow to compromise with Japan will also affect Japan's belief in the power of the Axis powers. This fact, coupled with the defeat of the Italian army and the failure of Germany's invasion of Britain, will increase the troubles of the Konoe Cabinet. Dissatisfaction with Konoe's policies is gradually growing within Japan, and Foreign Minister Matsuoka's diplomatic efforts have not been successful. This is probably a sign that the Tokyo government will soon undergo another change.</p>

<p>Washington　British Financial Secretary Phillips said yesterday that he is currently compiling a balance sheet of British income and expenditure for US Treasury Secretary Morgenthau to review. Phillips refused to acknowledge rumors that Britain was asking the United States for a loan, saying that the 35-minute meeting with Morgenthau was only to present Britain's resources, income, and supply expenses, and did not mention the war debt issue. Someone asked whether to consider selling Britain's territories in the Americas to the United States in order to obtain US dollars. Phillips replied that this matter was not within his jurisdiction and said that he would meet with Morgenthau again on Sunday. According to unofficial estimates, Britain's total assets in the United States are between 40 billion and 50 billion US dollars, and Britain is currently purchasing 10 billion yuan each year.

<p>Washington　Sir Frederick Phillips, the British Treasury representative, told visiting reporters yesterday that he plans to stay in Washington, New York, and Canada for a week.

A reporter asked whether the issue of unpaid British debt had been mentioned in yesterday's meeting with the US Treasury Secretary. He replied in the negative. (Reuters dispatch on the 7th)</p>
<p>Washington　Senior officials here revealed yesterday that President Roosevelt has decided to ask Congress to reinterpret the US financial and other aspects of the aid to Britain policy. After US Treasury Secretary Morgenthau met with the British Financial Secretary and requested a "balance sheet" of national property for another meeting to be held on Sunday, the President's request was announced. It is understood that US Treasury Secretary has also discussed with Argentinian Ambassador to the United States Espil and Argentinian Central Bank Manager Prebish about the 100 million US dollar loan to Argentina. According to government sources, this loan will be used as a model for lending other loans to Latin America. It is generally said that the purpose of this loan is to make Argentina more closely linked to the US Western Hemisphere defense plan. It is expected that Treasury Secretary Morgenthau and Secretary of State Hull will obtain a detailed report on the loans required by Britain when Roosevelt returns to Washington, so as to avoid the many proposals for the Johnson Act and the Neutrality Act (such as a large loan to Canada) that have been submitted. However, it is rumored that President Roosevelt told his advisors that what he wanted was only to ask Congress to make a clear explanation of what kind of assistance the US government would give to Britain. It is understood that President Roosevelt intends to submit this case to the new Congress that will meet in January next year. (International News Agency dispatch on the 7th)</p>
<p>Washington　At the request of Treasury Secretary Morgenthau, the Senate Finance Committee held a special meeting yesterday. Morgenthau and key Treasury officials were present. Informed sources believe that the main topic of discussion was the issue of economic assistance to Britain, but the Treasury Department has not announced the details of the negotiations with British economic representative Sir Frederick Phillips. According to Senator Nye (Republican), economic assistance to Britain is tantamount to participating in the war. Ships supplying Britain must be protected by the US fleet.

It is not without merit. It is widely believed that one factor to be noted is that Moscow has declared that it will not change its policy towards the public.

<h3 id="e24">Rumors of Germany Inducing Peace with Greece <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>The day before yesterday, just as Italian troops were continuing to retreat from the Albanian front, news suddenly came that Germany intended to entrust Turkey to mediate the Italian-Greek war, and that a peace plan had been submitted to Greece by the Turkish Foreign Minister. The news was issued by an American news agency, but its source was in the capitals of Hungary and Yugoslavia. The news from the Yugoslav capital was obtained through the Turkish side involved. Assuming that this news is somewhat true, it seems that this is the umpteenth peace offensive from the Axis powers. As of last night, the countries concerned had neither confirmed nor denied this rumor. It is possible that a formal denial will be issued in a day or two. But even if it is denied, the rumor cannot but make one suspect that there is a reason for it. Moreover, denials of all peace offensives are often a tactic used to cover up failure after hitting a wall.</p>
<p>Looking at the peace offensives repeatedly adopted by some belligerent countries in the world today, there are generally three types: (1) attempting to weaken the enemy's fighting spirit, and therefore sometimes becoming a smokescreen for intensified attacks or feints; (2) merely creating an atmosphere, with the intention of undermining the enemy's foreign relations or alienating the enemy's internal unity; (3) sometimes the initiators of peace offensives do have some intention of seeking peace, but often because they are unwilling to take the right path, they are climbing trees to catch fish, and the more they seek, the further they get. The first two types are poisonous tactics, and the last type is a major error in method. Although their natures are different, the failure is the same. If the rumor of Germany's inducement of peace with Greece is true, is its intention to break up the Anglo-Greek alliance? Or to prepare for future assistance in the war? Or is it truly aware of the difficulty of the Balkan war and willing to compromise to avoid the deterioration of the situation? This is a mystery that can be unraveled within a few days.</p>
<p>Let us explore why this rumor of inducement of peace has attracted attention and why it is suspected of being somewhat true. The main reasons are no more than two: one is the unexpected failure of the Italian military, and the other is the unexpected delay of German assistance. Because the Italian army can be said to have never won from the beginning, even the people most sympathetic to the Blackshirts cannot help but start to worry about whether it can turn defeat into victory. Because of Germany's coyness, sometimes assuring Turkey that it will not participate in the Balkan war, and sometimes declaring that it will not withdraw its expatriates within Greece, it makes people suspect that the Berlin authorities have been restrained by the Soviet Union and Bulgaria has sabotaged them, and it seems that they are somewhat retreating in the face of difficulty. Of course, these various expressions may only be acting, and in fact they may evolve into actual assistance in the war at any time. However, judging from the reality of the Italian military's failure in combat alone, it is undeniable that the National Socialist government cannot feel excited at the moment.</p>
<p>The Greek troops who have entered Albanian territory can be divided into three routes in general: (1) After occupying the Koriça Heights in the north, they divided their troops into two branches, one heading north and capturing the city of Pogradec in one fell swoop, and then advancing northwest from the city, reportedly reaching a small village 18 kilometers from Elbasan and 42 kilometers from the Albanian capital. One branch advanced northwest and occupied the city of Moschopolis, which can easily echo each other to threaten the oil fields between the Devol River and the Shkumbin River. (2) The central route is advancing along the Vjosë River and has occupied the port of Përmet in the upper reaches of the river. In the future, it will be heading west along the river to capture the ports of Klisura and Tepelenë, and then directly attacking the coastal port of Vlorë. (3) The southern route is a joint operation by the army and navy, which has occupied the port of Sarandë at the southwestern tip of Albania. This is an even more important victory than the conquest of the Koriça Heights, because it is said that the joint fleet of Britain and Greece will use the port as a base to harass southern Italy in the future. In addition, there is talk that the city of Gjirokastër has also fallen, and the city of Delvinë is under a two-pronged attack. It is widely rumored that the Italian troops in this area are retreating along the coast towards the port of Himarë.</p>
<p>Based on the above explanation of the war situation, although it is not敢 to determine Greece's inevitable victory, it can at least be said that the Blackshirts have suffered a complete defeat. According to the observations of British military experts, Greece cannot seize the final victory without occupying the ports of Vlorë and Durrës in Albania. Therefore, for the sake of Greece, it still seems that it should continue to pursue the victory. Germany's peace offensive may be a delaying tactic to allow the Blackshirts to make a comeback. In that case, wouldn't the hard battle of the Athens government be in vain? What's more, the successive resignations of General Badoglio, the Chief of Staff of the Italian Army, and the Governor of the Italian Dodecanese Islands, can be seen as Mussolini's preparation to step up the war on the one hand, but at the same time, it can reflect the lack of talent in the Italian military authorities, which is not the best opportunity for the Greek government to take advantage of its victory?</p>

<p>Cheqing: Shi Yousan's nature was frivolous, capricious, and prone to change. Although he had accumulated merit as a junior soldier to the rank of a Lieutenant Colonel, he always felt that he could not fully express his wild nature. Therefore, he took advantage of opportunities to arbitrarily expand his forces to satisfy his private ambitions. Our central government has always been magnanimous, pardoning past misdeeds, and entrusting him with responsibilities, hoping that he would render meritorious service in the area north and south of the Yellow River. Unexpectedly, his old habits did not change, and his wild nature remained untamed. Recently, he has been insincere and disobedient to the central government's operational orders.

<p>Vichy: The head of the German trade delegation, Dr. Koons, announced yesterday that Germany and France had signed an economic agreement to remove trade barriers between the two countries. Dr. Koons said that the agreement stipulates "an exchange rate of twenty francs equals one mark and guarantees the fair position of French industry in postwar Europe." At the same time, the French government suggested a quick implementation of the September 1934 agreement. The agreement had been delayed for four years by the French lower house until it was approved in the spring of 1939, but it was not implemented due to the war. The German-French economic agreement not only applies to France but also to the commerce of the continent. The exchange rate of twenty francs to one mark took effect on July 25, the day after the agreement was signed. Before the agreement, repayments were based on an exchange rate of 16.25 francs to one mark. Dr. Koons stated, "France should not have overly high expectations for this agreement. "This kind of agreement is only the beginning of cooperation. Experts will study procedures to increase commercial exchange with this new agreement." Dr. Koons also said, "Germany is currently at war. Due to the needs of the defense industry, it cannot make large-scale industrial production to France. France should wait for the signing of the peace treaty, and then establish a statutory basis for restoring relations. He claimed that through our two countries' cooperation in tomorrow's Europe, productivity will not be ignored, and France will also obtain a just position." (7th United Press dispatch)</p>

<p>Athens - The major southwestern Albanian city of Argyrokastron has been captured by the Greek army, according to news received here yesterday. It is said that Italian forces withdrew from the city in succession over the past four to eight hours, completing their evacuation on Thursday night. Greek aircraft bombed Valona and Clisura yesterday. Greek newspapers claim that the advancing Greek forces are now gradually threatening the oil region between the Teveli and Shushica rivers, which is said to be the sole source of oil supply for Italy. The fall of Argyrokastron will weaken the entire Italian right flank, as the Greek army has not only occupied Santi Quaranta but is also approaching the town of Telvino between Argyrokastron and the coast. On the northern front outside Blemendes, the Greek army is now pursuing the Italian forces, forcing them to retreat via Clisura towards Tepelene. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<p>Nanking - According to private sources, not yet officially confirmed, Greek forces, after a fierce offensive, occupied the Albanian town of Argyrokastron yesterday. Both sides suffered heavy losses. The Greek army is now continuing its advance north.

Southwest of Moschopolis, Greek forces have occupied Mount Vostrovia and are continuing to advance towards Berat. (Haitong, 7th)</p>
<p>Struga, Yugoslavia - Greek soldiers, wielding sharp weapons and fighting fiercely in the mountainous region northwest of Lake Ohrid, yesterday pushed the Italian forces back to a point just 18 kilometers from Elbasan. This advance yesterday was one of the most important battles of the Italo-Greek War. The Greek army has launched a fierce offensive towards Elbasan from several routes, attempting to reach the city and cut off the route to this important city, which is only 24 miles from Tirana. It is reported that the Greek army, having occupied Blemendes, has rendered the Italian coastal outlet of Valona useless. The Greeks also point out that the resignation of Italian Chief of General Staff General Badoglio is sufficient proof that the Italian army has acknowledged the losses it has suffered in Greece and Albania. The Athenians also consider the Greek army's occupation of Santi Quaranta the day before, which gives the Greek army a strong foothold for advancing north and progressing along the Albanian coast, to be important. (United Press, 7th)</p>
<p>Struga - Greek troops, crossing the mountains west of the Mokra mountain range, occupied a small village 18 kilometers southeast of Elbasan yesterday. Elbasan is an important town in central Albania, only 24 kilometers from Tirana. In addition, Greek forces are advancing towards Fushë-Bulqizë and Hashash, attempting to cut off the Elbasan highway. After occupying Blemendes in the center (20 kilometers northeast of Argyrokastron), the Greek forces captured seven Italian officers, 200 soldiers, three tanks, two trucks, and two light field guns on the highway. The Greek army immediately split into two teams to pursue. The left wing advanced seven kilometers on Thursday, seemingly towards the confluence of the Konizza and Viosa rivers. The right wing has advanced ten kilometers northeast. It is reported that the Greek forces in Moschopolis have crossed the pass of Mount Opari, 25 kilometers west of the town, and are slowly advancing towards the village of Skima.

<p>Constant Stream of Good News from the Northern and Southern Fronts: Greek Military Strategy Proves Effective</p>
<p>Athens - The Greek army is fighting more and more fiercely. Following the successive captures of Korçë and Pogradec in northern Albania, news has arrived of the fall of the key town of Blemendes. Argyrokastron, the last supply base for the Italian army in southern Albania, and Santi Quaranta, where Italian troop transport ships docked two months ago, have now both fallen into Greek hands. According to reports here, the Italian forces in Argyrokastron had completely withdrawn by Thursday night. However, the Greek army, according to the pre-determined plan of the commander-in-chief, continued to pursue the defeated army, while Rome is making every effort to try to reverse the defeat. General Badoglio, who previously conquered Albania, has now been dismissed from his post as commander-in-chief of the Italian army. This is the second major change in the Italian command since the start of the Italo-Greek War. According to the latest battle reports from the front, the Italian army is still rapidly retreating along the coastal road starting from Santi Quaranta towards the small port of Chimara. The Italian forces northwest of Blemendes are also abandoning the city and retreating. However, British and Greek air forces have destroyed bridges and roads behind the Italian lines, making the Italian retreat extremely difficult. The Greek military strategy is clever, avoiding the direct center of Argyrokastron, and this strategy is now gradually proving effective. In this line, the Greek army now holds the most important peaks. Elbasan is a key town, a junction of roads in central Albania, directly connected to the largest port of Durazzo. The Italian army has deployed new positions in the past few days, hoping to resist in Chimara and Tepelene, but their hope of holding the second or third line of defense now seems to be fading. If the several divisions of the Italian army retreating from the southwest fail to put up the resistance they hope for, part of the Italian army may retreat to Elbasan, but Elbasan is now gradually feeling the threat from the Greek army to the northeast. In the past few days, thousands of Italian soldiers have been captured, but there is no official report from the palace. Whether this number will increase significantly will depend on how the Italian forces near Argyrokastron conduct their rearguard action. The Italian army's resistance has not been weak, and many officers have been killed and captured. It is reported that the famous 48th Regiment and others also helped defend Argyrokastron. According to the latest news from the Lake Ohrid front, the Greek army has now crossed eight miles past Pogradec. Yesterday afternoon, the first batch of Greek troops entered the city of Argyrokastron, capturing many war materials such as four heavy guns and mountain guns and machine guns, and capturing a large Italian army unit. The Italian army is now retreating along the entire northern front, while the Greek army is advancing along the valleys of the Shushica, Teveli, and Viosa rivers towards Elbasan and Berat. In the past two days, 300 Italian and Albanian soldiers have surrendered to the Allied authorities, all saying that the Italian army is becoming increasingly chaotic and unable to maintain its power in Albania. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<p>Greek Troops Enter Santi Quaranta: Albanian and Greek People Vie to Welcome the Royal Army</p>
<p>Athens - A Greek government spokesman recently declared that Santi Quaranta can now serve as a valuable base for the Allied fleet to attack southern Italy. Regarding the occupation of Argyrokastron, the official here has not yet formally announced it, and the spokesman also said that the area has been completely occupied by the Greek army, and he cannot confirm that Santi Quaranta, which has been completely occupied by the Greek army, has been renamed "Aghioi Saranda" (meaning "Forty Martyrs") by the Greeks. The base that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini used to attack Greece has now been occupied by the Greek army and will be used by the British and Greek Allied forces to attack Italy. Italian troops have now retreated from Argyrokastron towards Deleto飞, so it can be said that the Greek army has already controlled the southern border of Albania. On Friday morning, the main force of the Greek army, led by captured Italian armored vehicles flying the blue and white Greek flag, entered the strategically important port of Santi Quaranta in three mighty columns. The Greek people of the area lined the streets, waving their handkerchiefs and cheering to welcome the Greek army. The Albanians, initially worried because they did not know how the Greek army would treat them, soon rushed into the streets and joined the Greek residents in offering food and drink to welcome the royal army, cheering the Greek army and chanting slogans for national independence. There was still a large sailing ship moored in the harbor, and an Italian destroyer sunk in the water. Greek artillery continuously fired from the mountain peaks near the city, covering the port in a network of artillery fire to prevent the Italian army from escaping by sea. The range of the Greek heavy artillery had reached Likursi, one mile south of Santi Quaranta, on Thursday evening, so the Greek army's occupation of this important Italian naval base became certain. Greek artillery also vigorously bombarded Italian military transport ships, hindering Italian transport. (United Press, 7th)</p>
<p>Italian Army Changes Commanders in Attempt to Reverse the Decline: Preparing for a Counter-Offensive Against Greece</p>
<p>Athens - Greek political observers yesterday believed that the transfer of Chief of General Staff Marshal Badoglio was sufficient to indicate that the Italian military had friction with the Fascist Party leaders. Observers also believe that this move is sufficient to indicate that the war against Greece under the leadership of the Italian High Command has failed. (United Press, 7th)</p>
<p>Rome - Yesterday, it was generally expected that the Italian army would launch an early counter-offensive in Albania and continue to advance into Egypt, as General Cavallero has been appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Italian army, replacing General Badoglio. Although General Cavallero came from humble beginnings, he is the well-known reorganizer of the Italian army. It is expected that Cavallero will soon command a large-scale offensive against Greece and Egypt. The official reason for the change of commander has not been announced, but it is generally regarded as a sign that a major offensive is imminent. (International Telegram, 7th)</p>
<p>Rome - Knowledgeable observers here believe that General Cavallero's succession of General Badoglio as Chief of Staff indicates that the Fascist Party will adopt a more radical policy, similar to the party's "March on Rome" in the past. Although Badoglio's resignation is not entirely the same as the German change of the General Staff in 1938, Mussolini has clearly recognized that the commander of the military must have absolute and consistent resonance with those who hold the reins of government. The new Chief of Staff Cavallero will soon hold a meeting with German Army Commander General Keitel. Sources predict that Cavallero will soon go to the Albanian front for inspection and will hold a meeting with Commander Graziani of the Italian East African Army in Italy in a few days to discuss the Italian plan to attack Egypt. Preparations for the war in the region have been completed, and the two transport systems have been completed. Cavallero is a blitzkrieg tactician who reorganized the Italian army in 1925 and advocated increasing the speed of the navy. General Badoglio remains as the head of the National Research Institute, in charge of scientific and military research. Cavallero was the first army commander appointed after Mussolini took power, and was a strong general in the previous Italo-Turkish War, the First European War, and the Abyssinian War.

<p>Another Famous Italian Military Figure: Governor Rossi of the Dodecanese Islands Resigns</p>
<p>London - According to the official Italian news agency, another famous Italian military figure, Governor General Rossi of the Dodecanese Islands, has also resigned. It is said that Rossi's resignation will cause great shock to the Italian people and will be regarded as evidence of a split between the Fascist Party and the army. One of the most unusual events in the Albanian war before has been the frequent transfer of Italian army commanders, about one per week. According to neutral sources in Rome, Mussolini recently held several meetings with his commanders, blaming each other for the failure in Greece. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<p>Rome - It is declared here that Governor General Rossi of the Italian Dodecanese Islands has resigned and will be succeeded by General Bastico, who will also command the garrison of the islands. Bastico is 64 years old and participated in the Italo-Turkish War from 1911 to 1912. During the last World War, he presided over the military academy. He achieved remarkable results in the Italian-Ethiopian War. He also participated in the Spanish Civil War. (Haitong, 7th)</p>

<p>Tragic History of the European War (4)</p>
<h3 id="e59">The Inside Story of Daladier and Reynaud's Affair of State Involving a Woman <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>May 6th, I met Reynaud and found him dispirited and often absent-minded. His desk was equipped with three telephones: one connected to the cabinet, one to the outside world, and one directly to the Countess de Portes' private chamber. The last one rang incessantly. Reynaud would pick up the receiver, listen for only a second, and then impatiently exclaim, "Yes... yes, of course... but I beg you, let me do some work..."</p>
<p>Finally, he simply stopped answering it.</p>
<p>Later, the situation in Norway deteriorated daily. The superior equipment of the German army was beginning to show its power. The Germans' prior preparations were meticulous and exhaustive, while France responded hastily, leaving brave soldiers exposed to enemy planes, bombs, and machine guns due to a lack of anti-aircraft guns. The difference between the two sides was like heaven and earth. Even the most optimistic people felt as if cold water had been poured on them, and their hearts grew weary. Reynaud believed that France's lack of preparation, leading to this unfortunate situation, was the responsibility of his political enemies.</p>
<p>He told me that they were deceiving each other, even withholding a pair of letters from Admiral Darlan from him. The letters detailed the difficulties. If he had known earlier, he could have avoided it. "This afternoon, I will attend the Senate committee, and I will reveal all the truth to them."</p>
<p>At this time, the conflict between Daladier and Reynaud intensified, so much so that President Lebrun had to intervene and act as a mediator.</p>
<p>At 9:00 AM on May 10th, I was preparing to go to the countryside for a vacation. However, at 8:30 AM, I heard on the radio that the German army had invaded the Netherlands and Belgium. The general offensive had begun. Those on vacation were recalled to camp, and I went to the North Station, preparing to return to the Arras defense line. The train added several cars, but British and French soldiers were still crammed in. I heard an infantry captain nearby saying goodbye to his wife. He said:</p>
<p>"My dear, listen! There is money in the left-hand drawer of the glass wardrobe, and some change in the drawer of the bedside table. You can take them all. The keys to the garage and the car door are in my room, on the tea tray on top of the drawer chest. Ask [someone named] Bede to put some mothballs in my clothes after I take them off. The pedals of [someone named] Qinhen's bicycle are making squeaking noises; they need some oil. What did you say? These past two days have gone by so quickly? That's right, if we can stop the enemy, the war might end here."</p>
<p>His wife smiled, looking brave. It is incorrect to say that the morale of France had declined before the offensive began. The upper classes and those with inside information may have been discouraged, but the general public was still full of hope, further numbed by the radio broadcasts eight times a day.</p>
<p>The news of the German army breaking through the French lines at Sedan came like a bolt from the blue, completely unexpected by the citizens of Paris. They prepared to consider evacuation if necessary. They had gained ample experience in 1914, and they believed that the enemy's offensive would soon be contained. By May 17th, a column of German mechanized troops had advanced directly towards Laon. Gamelin advised the government that he could no longer guarantee the defense of Paris beyond that night. On this day, internal chaos and panic reached their peak.</p>
<p>Early the next morning, the citizens of Paris heard that the German army had turned towards the English Channel, knowing that they had a few days of respite. At this critical juncture, Reynaud suddenly gained courage and resolutely implemented the actions he had repeatedly delayed. He believed that Gamelin was responsible for the failure and insisted on replacing him. Because Daladier strongly defended Gamelin, Reynaud transferred Daladier to the position of Minister of Foreign Affairs, taking over the Ministry of War himself. As for who would be the new commander-in-chief, Reynaud had long intended to appoint Georges, but he was afraid that Gamelin would be too humiliated. The animosity between Gamelin and Georges was no less than that between Reynaud and Daladier!</p>
<p>A British general once said, "They are so busy with internal strife that they naturally have no time to fight the Germans!"</p>
<p>In addition, General Noguès, who had achieved remarkable military achievements in Morocco and North Africa, also had hopes of being selected. Among the young generals, Huningue and Giraud both had supporters within their ranks. Huningue was resourceful and had led his troops in staunch resistance against the German army. Giraud was also an outstanding general, but he was captured at that time because he relied on his courage and underestimated the enemy. Reynaud finally decided to transfer General Weygand, the commander of the French forces in the Near East, and urgently called him back to Paris. In 1918, Weygand's military rank was second only to General Foch. Foch took command of the army when the war situation was critical and turned defeat into victory. Since Weygand had worked with him, Reynaud naturally wanted to draw on his experience.</p>
<p>At the same time, Reynaud offered the position of Vice-Premier to the veteran Pétain.</p>
<p>In the eyes of most French people, Pétain's reputation was so great that no one else could compare to him. His dignified appearance, tall stature, and cold expression left a deep impression on those who met him. Of the six generals who had achieved glorious victories in the last World War, only two were still alive: Foch and Pétain. Although he was already eighty-four years old, he was still energetic and vigorous, inspiring even greater respect and awe.</p>
<p>Reynaud summoned Pétain to the cabinet as an assistant, believing that by relying on his great name, he could strengthen his own position and unite national opinion. Unexpectedly, his new colleague proved to be merely a figurehead, and he realized that he had miscalculated. He had only found a successor and his own judge.</p>
<p>On June 6th, Daladier completely withdrew from the political stage, and the conflict between Reynaud and him finally came to an end. Just a few months earlier, Daladier was the master of France, wielding great power and enjoying immense popularity. Once a sudden wave arose, he was swept away without a trace. When he quietly disappeared, he did not express any remorse or surprise.</p>
<p>General Gamelin, who had long been under Daladier's protection, had also retired to his home, living in a quiet villa on Foch Avenue. He wore civilian clothes and was busy typing, preparing to write a memoir defending himself.</p>
<p>When General Gamelin was in power, a female friend of his family, who still did not forget their old friendship when they fell from power, went to see Madame Gamelin before leaving Paris. She found Madame Gamelin's attitude still extremely calm and composed.</p>
<p>Madame Gamelin said, "The General and I live together. He doesn't think about himself, only about France and his former subordinates. He greatly admires General Weygand and hopes that he can stop the enemy."</p>
<p>She pointed to a room, revealing that she was a gentle and virtuous woman who deeply loved her husband. We had been to the room before, where a portrait of Gamelin as a child, painted by his mother, hung on the wall. He was wearing long clothes and playing a copper drum, looking very lively and lovely.</p>
<p>She excitedly said, "Do you hear that? That's the sound of his little typewriter."</p>
<p>The above-mentioned are all serious conflicts between individuals, which have caused great difficulties in the conduct of the war. Although such infighting has existed in all dynasties, jealousy and ambition are inherent in human nature. In 1914, Clemenceau and Poincaré also had disagreements, but France finally achieved victory. At that time, the officials in charge were of high moral character and had a strong sense of patriotism, so they were able to overcome their personal desires. Poincaré, although he did not like Clemenceau, was able to cooperate with him loyally. Pétain also humbled himself and accepted Foch's command. The situation in France in 1940 was different. Factions were divided, and resentment was extreme. Public morality had declined, and personal hatred was unchecked. Although disregarding personal issues, the main reason for France's failure was that Britain and France lacked preparation in military, diplomatic, and industrial affairs. However, the officials were openly and secretly fighting, and there was no strong leader to unify the country. The military also lost the last chance to resist. (The End)</p>

<p>Nearly 20,000 Bags of Foreign Rice Arrived Yesterday, Another 70,000 Bags Will Arrive Soon</p>
<p>Therefore, There is No Shortage of Rice, Only a Lack of Price Stabilization</p>
<p>Shanghai rice prices are constantly rising, with rumors that the source will become scarce, but the reality is just the opposite. A large amount of foreign rice is still arriving in Shanghai. The Jardine Matheson &amp; Co.'s ship "Daily Rise" brought 9,290 bags from Hong Kong, and the company's "Morning Star" also transported 10,070 bags from Hong Kong, arriving yesterday and unloading at the Roosevelt Wharf. In addition, the Taikoo Dockyard &amp; Engineering Company's "Canton" ship also arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon, bringing 9,021 bags from Hong Kong and unloading at the company's wharf in the French Concession. Yesterday, the three ships brought a total of 18,381 bags of foreign rice. It is reported that the French company "Dad Nan" directly shipped 70,000 bags of foreign rice from Saigon, which is expected to arrive next Tuesday. (Zu)</p>
<p>The rice market is soaring, because there is no effective management method. No matter how much is advocated, it is no match for the powerful speculative groups. If you want to curb the low rice price, the rice price is still rising day by day. Yesterday, there was a rumor of changing to ordering rice from Burma. Speculators and rice merchants also fabricated that the price of rice in Rangoon had risen by three yuan, with the intention of shaking people's hearts and raising the price of rice. Since the daily rise, as long as you buy it today, you can enjoy a profit of several yuan overnight. Therefore, they only buy it and are unwilling to sell it. As a result, the price of rice only rises and does not fall back. Although Shanghai is a prosperous city, most households do not have a stone of storage and people do not have overnight grain. Due to the rice market being controlled by groups, the social unrest is progressing at the same rate as the rice price rise. How can the working class not be poor and cold today? It is difficult to survive. Yesterday, Saigon No. 1 was 89.5 yuan and 88 yuan, No. 2 was 84 yuan and 83 yuan, fire-milled was 88 yuan to 83 yuan, No. 2 mixed was 81.7 yuan and 81 yuan, small-milled was 80.05 yuan and 80 yuan, rice chaff was 76.5 yuan, broken rice was 73 yuan, medium was 70.05 yuan, Tokyo polished was 80.05 yuan, Wuhu pointed was 79.5 yuan and 78 yuan, and all spot rice rose by 2 yuan. The English-Chinese company's No. 1 spot price opened at 103 yuan, then to 104.2 yuan. No. 2 on the 12th also reached 95.5 yuan and 96 yuan, the small-milled price was only 90.05 yuan, and then rose sharply to 92 yuan. In the afternoon, Dingtai Bank suddenly threw out 1,000 tons of Saigon No. 2, priced at 88 yuan, which was shipped from late January to early February. Therefore, the public's sentiment was slightly stabilized in the afternoon, and the total transaction of spot goods for the whole day was no less than 20,000 bags, and the term road was 600 to 700 tons.</p>
<p>The selling price of thick and thin japonica rice is high, and the sales are average. Therefore, the cargo owner wants to make a profit but is unable to. As a result, the price has increased by several yuan. Kai Kunshan rice quoted white japonica at 100 yuan and 97 yuan. Qingjiao thin original package was 95-96 yuan, and polished was 91.5 yuan and 90.05 yuan.</p>
<p>The domestic glutinous rice is flat due to high prices, and the goods from Hong Kong are quite popular, and the price has also increased by one yuan. Kai Lier was 100 yuan, medium was 98 yuan, Hong Kong was 89 yuan and 87 yuan, and glutinous green bean was 77 yuan to 73 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e63">Australian Flour Sales are Most Active <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the price of foreign flour rebounded again. After the previous two days of tending to be flat, yesterday, with the price of rice rising again, the local customers' sales were quite active. The price of Australian foreign flour, with the brands "Clock Tower" and "Flower and Bird," rose again to 20.2 yuan. Road cargo also needs 19.95 yuan to 20 yuan. The high-grade Australian flour has reached 20.05 yuan, which is two to three corners tighter than the previous day. The road cargo of foreign flour will arrive in the middle of next week, with a total of more than 200,000 bags. Most of them have been sold in advance, so the market is still stable. As for the Chinese factory flour, more than 6,000 bags have been sold, all of which must be purchased by the designated flour shops, and the flat price is still 18 yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday, wheat was still calm, but the market gradually improved. Because the source of rice in the mainland was blocked, and foreign wheat could not be fully supplied for a while, everyone's sentiment was firm. It is heard that a certain factory's pre-ordered foreign wheat will arrive soon. The factory is waiting for the foreign wheat raw materials to arrive for use, otherwise it will be difficult to start work. Therefore, the flour factory's business this year is no longer comparable to the past. Currently, the market price of Du wheat has reached 30 yuan, and the trading is only in negotiation.</p>
<h3 id="e64">Finance: Few Transactions, Little Activity, Stable Foreign Exchange <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market, Zou Feng quoted prices, all without ups and downs. In the British and American black markets, there was a softness in the quietness. With the Hong Kong Telegraph Company's absorption, banks settled, and the selling was inferior to the buying. Still, because American banks provided abundant supply, the shortage was limited. Speculators made few moves, mostly watching. By noon closing, both British and American views were slightly softened. The spot price of British gold was 3 pence 7835, and the US exchange rate was 5.96875. The forward prices were still pulling apart.</p>
<p>The US Exchange Rate Returns Below 6 Yuan</p>

The central listing of various exchanges remained the same as before. The bank opened the spot selling price in the morning, British gold at 3 pence 796875, and the US exchange rate at 6 yuan, both the same as the closing price the previous night. After opening, the Hong Kong Telegraph Company purchased, and the market immediately became soft. At that time, the American bank settled with the Hong Kong Telegraph Company for the US exchange rate of 5.96875 for this month. The HSBC listing revealed that the opening was not moving, and the silver balance tax announcement was increased by 0.50 percent. Afterwards, Chinese merchants and others also absorbed, but American banks continued to sell, and foreign banks were willing to supply, and the market recovered. It is estimated that the opening price for this month's US exchange rate was 6 yuan. By noon, because Chinese banks and others had a strong appetite, the situation was still tight. The closing price for spot goods and this month's British gold was 3 pence 78125, the US exchange rate was 5.96875, the next month's British gold was 3 pence 765625, and the US exchange rate was 5.9375, which was 0.015625 tighter for British gold and 0.03125 narrower for the US exchange rate than the spot goods on the previous day and the British gold for this month.

<p>Yesterday's spot gold black market situation was mediocre, and because there were not many transactions in the half-day on Saturday, the ups and downs were also narrow, but the price was quite firm. It opened at 5,750 yuan in the morning, and then fell slightly due to the sale of cash by securities firms, but the closing price was heard to be good in the exchange market, reaching 5,780 yuan, and the closing price was announced at 5,771 yuan, which was 23 yuan higher than the previous day.

<p>Securities: Domestic Debt Popularity Rises Again</p>

The tenth interest payment is not far away, and after the interest payment at the end of January next year, there may still be a special surge.

<h3 id="e67">Financial Review - December 7th - <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>- By Saint-Catherine</p>
<p>China-US Financial Cooperation</p>
<p>The news that the United States would actively provide China with economic assistance, which was circulated in mid-October, has been concretely confirmed in the voices of so-called "Nanjing government" signed by Japan. At the end of November, US President Roosevelt announced: The United States will lend China US$100 million, half of which will be used for general purposes, and half of which will be used to protect China's monetary system and maintain Sino-US currency relations. On December 2, the US Senate Banking Committee and the House of Representatives Monetary Committee unanimously approved the US lending China US$100 million. Half of this amount is allocated by the Export-Import Bank, and half is allocated from the Treasury Equalization Fund.</p>
<p>According to telegrams, the method of this loan, regarding the allocation of the Export-Import Bank, is for general purposes. According to the letter from Mr. Pus, the special commissioner of the Central Debt, to President Roosevelt, the subsidiary organization of the Gold Reserve Corporation, the Five Gold Reserve Corporation, is now continuing to order tungsten, antimony, tin, and other items from the China Resources Committee, with a value of 60 million yuan. The goods will be delivered in the next few years at the price suitable for the market conditions at the time of delivery. However, in order to help China cope with its current financial problems, the Export-Import Bank of the United States has agreed to lend China 50 million yuan, guaranteed by the Central Bank of China, and offset by the above-mentioned order of five gold. It can be seen that it is a commercial credit loan, which is the same as the first and second Shinagawa loans in the way of lending, but different in the way of using it. The credit loans of US$25 million on December 15, 1938, and US$20 million on March 7, 1940, were used to transfer the purchase of US agricultural products, hardware, gasoline, trucks, road construction machines, mining machines, smelting machines, and other raw materials necessary for construction, while this loan is to assist China in coping with current financial problems. The credit loan of the third loan (September 26, 1940) is not only the same in the way of lending, but also similar in the way of using it, because the official documents of the United States state that the US government lent China US$25 million to maintain China's foreign exchange needs.</p>
<p>The reason, regarding the allocation of the Treasury Equalization Fund, is for the purpose of stabilizing legal tender. According to US Treasury Secretary Morgenthau on the 2nd, the government has not yet decided on all the details of stabilizing legal tender, but this plan will undoubtedly follow the current negotiations with Mr. Song Ziwen to purchase legal tender at a certain rate. The detailed content will not be officially announced by the United States until the talks are established in Washington and Mr. Song Ziwen does not agree to disclose them. At the same time, Mr. Moore solemnly stated that the Equalization Fund will only engage in small stabilization work, which is neither a loan nor credit to China, but only purchases legal tender in US dollars.</p>
<p>(To be continued) Large, most of them were eaten up by financial market prices, and more than 2 million were continuously sold on the market, but they were never able to lower the market price, which shows the strong purchasing power. The transactions were flat in the morning, and the market price was slightly weak. Xinfusheng said that there was a rush to sell, and Hongda Lianhe and others also sold, and Yongchang Renkang Hengfu Lianyi Tongkang all bought in. The selling was more vigorous, so it continued to weaken by one or two corners. In the afternoon, the trend first weakened and then became firm. Category C rose from 3.25 yuan to 5.5 corners. After the closing, it was suddenly rumored that there was hope for the establishment of a British loan, and the black market rose by two or three corners. Xie Xingyuan strongly covered the short position, and Defu Lianhe and Lianyi also bought a lot. Wuyuan Renchang Xiekang also had needs, and the sellers were relatively weak. Tongkang Sheng sold more, and Sankai Shuntai Cunyi sold slightly. As a result, the counterattack rose by 5 corners to 6 corners, with Category D rising sharply by 6 corners the most. Most of them were taken by Defu Company, and the transaction was about 2.34 million yuan. The following is a brief table,</p>

<p>The yarn market is firm, and the rising wind is spiraling upwards. This is because the bulls are enthusiastically active. Therefore, although there are large households selling in large quantities, the buyers have a very strong appetite, and the amount sold is small. It is almost completely searched and depleted, so the trend is tighter. At the same time, in Hong Kong, the actual transactions are still constantly lacking. The procurement of various yarns is more than yesterday. Today, 1,250 pieces of cotton yarn were shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Double Horse opened in the morning, because the sentiment turned up in the afternoon of the previous day, and most discussions were bullish. The first market price was 1,237 yuan. As soon as this market opened, everyone rushed in together, rising directly to 1,244 yuan. Unexpectedly, large households still came to sell, and the table turned loose for a while, falling back to 1,241 yuan. This price hovered for a long time. It was then heard that the spot sales business was still not bad, and the bulls' intentions were very strong. Near 11 o'clock, the bulls shouted and allowed fiercely, rising to 1,250 yuan. Afterwards, profits were released, and it loosened by a few yuan. The closing price was 1,249 yuan. It is estimated that the half-day transaction statistics were 5,906 bales. The 20-count Double Horse rose by 10 yuan. The amount bought by each helping is as follows:</p>

<p>The current cotton situation is trending towards improvement. Due to the rebound in the yarn market, factories like Xin'an, etc., are seeing transactions for 32-count single yarn raw materials. Japanese factories are also showing activity. As a result, trading houses are buying and selling from each other, further improving the situation. Confidence is stronger, but prices remain calm.</p>
<p>In other news, the foreign cotton market in New York is also becoming active. First, due to purchases by spot traders, and then due to increased demand from the industry, the closing price was four to five points higher than the previous day. The Indian market is closed, with forecasts predicting an increase of several rupees.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Shanghai's foreign cotton trading was relatively quiet due to the weekend. All parties temporarily suspended purchases, so trading will have to rely on next week.</p>

Today, 2,710 pieces of piece goods arrived in Hong Kong, and 25 pieces were shipped to Yantai.</p>
<p>Eastern Cloth: White goods are experiencing strong demand due to continuous demand for dyed fabrics on this street, and the market sentiment is very firm. Sales are doing well. The closing price for 12-pound Longtou fine cloth remains at $35.95. Jiaojunzi drill is selling for $1.095.

<h3 id="e73">Cost of Living Allowances Should Adopt a "Sliding Scale System" <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>— Hao</p>
<p>Since the prices in Shanghai have risen in a straight line, the issue of allowances between labor and management has arisen immediately. Generally, employees find that their salaries are insufficient to maintain their family's livelihood, so they have asked the employer to increase allowances. The employer also believes that they cannot force employees to work on an empty stomach, and automatically or passively increase salary and allowances for employees. The allowance method and the size of the amount are mostly determined arbitrarily by the employer, without any reasonable basis. Some add a percentage to the original salary, and others give a fixed allowance of tens of dollars. Although employees can barely survive for a while with this, the anxiety about living has not disappeared. Because prices are constantly changing, increasing without decreasing, and allowances are fixed and limited, if the salary is increased by several dollars this month, the cost of living will increase sharply in the following months, then what is the point of increasing the amount? No wonder employees are always worried. As prices rise and the cost of living rises, employees will still be unable to support their lives, and they will inevitably ask for a salary increase again, in a cycle of back and forth, which is not a long-term solution. Looking at the labor unrest in various industries in the past, the reason is that the allowance methods adopted have failed to adapt to this situation. Although there has been some discussion in the past regarding public opinion, no specific and feasible compromise method has been found. This problem has been lingering in the author's mind for a long time, and recently the threat to life has become increasingly severe. Moreover, the allowance method adopted by the company where I work is as incomplete as others, so I feel like a bone is stuck in my throat, and I have to spit it out quickly. Therefore, I would like to take an impartial attitude and make some proposals on this issue, hoping to elicit valuable opinions.</p>
<p>Employees exchange labor for wages to maintain their family's livelihood. Now, due to high prices, that is, the result of the low purchasing power of money, the wages earned are not enough to maintain their lives, and the employer should give appropriate compensation to increase the amount of their salary, which is their due responsibility. However, what kind of standard should be used to increase</p>
<p>Cost of Living Allowances Should Adopt a "Sliding Scale System" – Hao</p>
<p>Since the prices in Shanghai have risen in a straight line, the issue of allowances between labor and management has arisen immediately. What kind of standard should be used to increase employee income? The author believes that a "sliding scale system" should be adopted, that is, a fixed "standard wage" and a fixed "allowance percentage" should be used, and the allowance should be increased or decreased monthly according to the multiple of the increase in the cost of living for workers published by the Engineering Department of the Public Works Department compared to the base period. In order to adapt to the changing situation of prices and relieve the anxiety of workers' lives, the details are as follows.</p>
<p>The cost of living index for workers published by the Engineering Department of the Public Works Department is a reliable measure of the expenses required to maintain a certain standard of living. It is divided into five items: food, rent, clothing, fuel, and miscellaneous items; however, these five expenses are all necessary to maintain life, so a total index is listed separately, which in November of this year was 540.62. (with 1936 as the base period). Moreover, since the recent expenses have been increasing day by day and the living standards of workers have declined, the cost of reducing the standard of living is said to have increased by 3.91 times. The current suggestion is to increase or decrease the allowance proportionally according to the multiple of this increase, which is the most reasonable and practical basis.</p>
<p>Considering that there is such a reasonable and practical standard, as far as the author knows, neither the upper nor lower levels have adopted it. However, we have often heard that the labor side raises the demand for salary increases based on the cost of living index, which is often rejected by the employer. Some employers even shake their heads and show disgust as soon as they hear the word "index," feeling that the cost of living index is too high and the employer has its own difficulties, and is often unable to make this same proportional salary increase, so they refuse to eat because of choking? In fact, it is a well-known fact that the assets and business conditions of various industries are different, and it is difficult to force them to make the same amount of allowances. However, as long as the method is slightly compromised and changed, any factory can adopt it. The so-called change is to increase or decrease a certain percentage of the allowance, and the effect of adapting to price changes is the same. For example, employers with abundant financial resources can afford to pay 100% of the allowance; if their financial resources are indeed insufficient, they can also reduce the percentage of the allowance, setting it at 70%, 40%, but the minimum cannot be less than 25%.</p>
<p>I also heard people say: "Big difficulties for big ones, small difficulties for small ones," meaning that at this time, it is difficult to maintain the life of those with small salaries: those with large salaries also have their difficulties. However, the author believes that at this time of hardship, those with large salaries (referring to those with monthly salaries of several hundred dollars) may as well slightly reduce their enjoyment of life to maintain it; while those with small salaries, the life they lead is originally "minimal," and in fact there is no way to reduce it, so the need to increase allowances is more urgent. Therefore, increasing according to the proportion of the original salary is obviously not in line with reality, and another standard wage should be set. The multiple of the increase in the cost of living for this standard wage, or the percentage of the allowance, is the cost-of-living allowance that each employee, regardless of the size of their original salary, should receive.</p>
<p>To give an example: In November, the cost of living increased by 3.91 times compared to this. Assuming that the standard wage is $50, and assuming that the percentage of the allowance is 0.25, the calculation formula is as follows:</p>
<p>(3.91×0.25)×＄50＝0.9775×＄50＝＄48.87 $48.87 is the allowance that employees should receive in November.</p>
<p>The above-mentioned standard wage is just an example estimate made by the author based on a family of five, without any solid basis, and should not be regarded as a fixed rule. It is hoped that the Engineering Department of the Public Works Department will formulate and publish this standard wage so that the authorities in various industries have something to base it on, and I think that department will also be happy to do so.</p>
<p>If the wise authorities of various industries can adopt this labor-saving system to subsidize employees, the employees can reduce their anxiety about life and concentrate on production and work; and the employers can also avoid the trouble of dealing with personnel disputes and unfortunate losses, wouldn't it be a win-win situation?</p>

<h3 id="e74">After Increasing Staff Subsidies, Shanghai Municipal Council Expenditures Surge, Resulting in an Annual Shortfall of Ten Million, Requiring Either a Second Round of Borrowing or Increased Taxes <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>A spokesperson for the Shanghai Municipal Council (SMC) disclosed yesterday (the 7th) that, following the approval of increased cost-of-living allowances for employees, monthly expenditures will increase by seven to eight million yuan. This figure is a "rough estimate." Given that the SMC has already approved employee allowance increases twice this year, the 1940 budget is expected to be in deficit. The total amount of the shortfall cannot be disclosed at this time. The SMC is currently preparing a detailed financial report, which will be released soon. Until then, the exact amount of the deficit cannot be determined.</p>
<p>This Year's Budget Short by Ten Million</p>
<p>However, according to a financial expert here, considering the SMC's repeated increases in staff allowances this year, the 1940 budget will be short by at least ten million yuan. The SMC increased taxes by 15% on July 1st this year and borrowed 16 million yuan from HSBC, generating special revenue. It is estimated that the revenue reached a total of 32 million yuan, but it is expected that this amount has already been allocated to other necessary expenses.</p>
<p>Further Tax Increases Quite Possible</p>
<p>Therefore, the SMC may have to borrow money for a second time this year or convene a special meeting of taxpayers to increase taxes further. If the SMC takes such action, it is expected that taxes in the International Settlement will increase by another 13%. At the same time, employees of the SMC's police and other departments have expressed enthusiastic satisfaction with the SMC's approval of cost-of-living allowances. Some police officers stated that the authorities should have taken this action earlier, as employees might not have resigned in large numbers, and personnel in the police and fire departments would not have been at risk of work slowdowns.</p>
<p>Grade A Staff Cost-of-Living Allowances</p>
<p>The SMC's Information Office announced yesterday that, regarding the "Increase in Allowances for Chinese Constables and Staff" announcement issued by the SMC yesterday, the following should be added to the end: "Grade A staff receiving foreign exchange allowances will only receive cost-of-living allowances based on two-thirds of their basic salary, i.e., 150% of the first 500 yuan of two-thirds of their salary, and so on."</p>
<p>Chinese Constable Representatives Encourage People</p>
<p>The Chinese Constable Representatives Committee issued a letter to all colleagues to conclude the living requirements. It begins by stating that the occurrence of neglect of duty on our part is indeed due to the high pressure of life. We were elected by all to present our living requirements to the SMC. The SMC has understood and has given the "on the album" for Chinese constables and police officers (issued on December 6). We try to reflect on ourselves. The Representative Committee is seeking satisfaction on behalf of all our colleagues in life. Regarding the establishment of a mutual aid society, we thank the Chief of the Police Department of the SMC for his approval, and Mr. Yu Qiaqing is handling it, seeking permanent welfare for our colleagues. With the enthusiastic donations of our colleagues, the total amount of funds for the mutual aid society is 5,585 yuan, which has been sent to Mr. Yu Qiaqing for safekeeping. Furthermore, Mr. Yu Qiaqing will raise another 50,000 yuan to establish the mutual aid society fund. In short, the rational demands of all our colleagues have been rationally resolved. We should still adhere to our original intention of serving the SMC and the citizens, and with the spirit of taking care of the overall situation, we must serve with faith and loyalty to ensure local security, strictly prevent incitement, and not be shaken by rumors and act rashly, so as to affect the overall situation and plunge the locality into a state of unrest. Moreover, this kind of excessive behavior is not allowed by law and is contrary to our due duty. It is expected that all my colleagues can deeply understand the righteousness, not change this intention, and not violate this purpose. It can be expected that the merits and demerits of this association will be set aside, and to all my colleagues, we should pay tribute to incense and flowers and bless Mr. Yu Qiaqing, the leader of the citizens. We should also repay the millions of citizens with the spirit of loyal service, because the assistance and sympathy given to us are too enthusiastic and great, and the SMC's understanding of our urgency is even more worthy of our gratitude. From now on, we must never fail these sympathies and lose the valuable rear support that we have already obtained. Therefore, this association has completed the task of demanding life and will end here. For the final announcement of this association, all my colleagues should accept, be safe and self-sufficient, and abide by laws and police regulations, otherwise it will be illegal. I hope my colleagues will learn from this. Sincerely, Shanghai British Concession SMC Police Department Chinese Constable Representatives Committee, December 7, 1940.</p>

<p>Mutual Aid Society to Be Organized Immediately</p>
<p>After the Chinese Constable Committee announced its dissolution, the Chinese Constable Mutual Aid Society will be organized immediately. Yesterday afternoon, eight representatives of the Chinese constables paid a special visit to Mr. Yu Qiaqing and Mr. Yao Zengmo, the Deputy Chief of the Chinese Police Department, to express their gratitude and to ask them to be responsible for sponsoring the establishment of the mutual aid society. The two expressed their approval. The Chinese constable representatives then handed over a portion of the funds raised by the Chinese constables, more than 5,500 yuan, to Mr. Yu. Mr. Yu had previously agreed to raise 50,000 yuan to sponsor this matter, and yesterday he agreed to raise an additional 50,000 yuan from the business community, totaling 100,000 yuan, to serve as the mutual aid society fund. After the funds are raised, they will be deposited in the bank together to be used for various mutually beneficial undertakings for the Chinese constables in the future. All association affairs are actively underway.</p>
<h3 id="e75">The Charity Relief Association Sends Letters to All Sectors to Solicit Donations <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>The joint charity relief association holds a winter relief campaign every year to benefit the poor. This year, rice prices have soared, and life has become more difficult. The association has learned that the main relief work, such as providing rice, clothing, and steamed buns, as well as setting up shelters for the poor, will continue as usual. However, with everyone's support, the association hopes to receive enthusiastic donations from all sectors to achieve complete success. The association issued two circulars yesterday, calling on all sectors to provide assistance. The following is a separate record:</p>
<p>Call for Payment of Subscription Donations</p>
<p>Respectfully, our association held a reception for all sectors at the Gongdelin on November 22 to raise funds for winter relief. We are grateful for your presence, and donations reached 46,000 yuan on the spot. Other relief items were also numerous. We have rented two mu of land at Yan's residence on Difeng Road from the SMC to set up shelters, and we are building sheds and making bedding for regular shelter. However, this year's prices are extremely high.</p>
<h3 id="e76">The French Police Department Considers Increasing Allowances for Chinese Constables <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>In view of the high cost of living in Shanghai, the French Concession police authorities, and the Chinese constables of the Public Concession police have been specially decided by the SMC Board of Directors to improve the treatment of Chinese constables as much as possible. The French Concession cannot lag behind. Therefore, the French Police Department has suggested to the French Municipal Council to increase the allowances for its Chinese constables so that they can maintain their lives and serve with peace of mind. It is understood that the French authorities are currently considering the detailed measures for the allowance, which will be announced soon. Rice, clothing, steamed buns, and relief for the poor are all included. The total amount required is more than 300,000 yuan. The shortfall of the aforementioned recognized donations is extremely large, and we should continue to appeal. We are enclosing a donation appeal and respectfully request that you donate the money you pledged as soon as possible to help with the progress. If you can help raise more money, that would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>Continue to Appeal</p>
<p>Respectfully, our association organizes winter relief every year to help the general poor, including providing rice, clothing, steamed buns, and relief for the hidden poor, as well as temporary shelters to accommodate the homeless and foodless poor. We have also helped to break the habit of smoking addiction. Over the years, we have received social recognition. This year, rice prices have soared, and everything is expensive, making the lives of the poor even more difficult. Beggars have no way to make a living, and starvation is rampant. Newspaper reports have recorded more than a thousand shocking cases that bring tears to the eyes. Our association has been urged by all parties to continue to carry out all winter relief matters as before. However, since this year's prices are extremely high, a large amount of money is needed, and our association's finances are extremely tight. We have no choice but to appeal widely in the hope that everyone will work together. We have always admired your compassion and care for others. We are sending you a letter asking you to donate and raise funds so that we can gather strength and complete this meritorious deed.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the coal briquette market was quite unstable. As a result, the coal briquette factory's price rose from 152 yuan to 160 yuan per ton, an increase of 8 yuan per ton. The retail price rose from 8.2 yuan to 8.6 yuan per dan (100 jin), an increase of 4 jiao per dan. This was clearly caused by unscrupulous people spreading unfounded rumors.</p>

<h3 id="e78">Rice Market Repeatedly Exceeds Price Limits, Exceeding Legal Profits. Authorities to Convene Meeting Tomorrow to Discuss Stabilization Measures. Hong Kong Has Not Banned the Export of Tribute Rice. <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Rice Industry Association previously issued an emergency notice on the 4th of this month due to the soaring rice prices, which had a great impact on the people's food supply, limiting rice prices to no more than the prices on the 3rd of this month. However, recently rice prices have risen again, not only exceeding the above price limit, but also exceeding the profits that should be obtained, which is not appropriate. In view of this, the authorities of the two settlements have been actively trying to suppress rice prices, and have scheduled a meeting for 2 p.m. next Monday (the 9th of this month) to convene rice industry leaders to discuss ways to stabilize the rice market and maintain the people's food supply. It is understood that the exchange rate has improved recently, and the cost of ordering foreign rice has been reduced, so rice prices in this city should gradually fall.</p>
<p>Letter to French Consulate to Release Specified Rice</p>
<p>The Shanghai Bean, Rice, Miscellaneous Grain, Oil Cake Industry, and Rice Grain Evaluation Committee, a group of three rice industries, jointly sent a letter to Mr. Majeri, the French Consul General in Shanghai, yesterday, stating that our association entrusted various foreign firms to order a total of 8,500 tons of No. 1 rice from Saigon in October and November of this year, specifying that they would be loaded onto ships in December of this year and sent to Shanghai to supply the people with food. According to reports from various foreign firms, the government of that place has banned the export of No. 1 rice, but No. 2 rice can still be shipped. Therefore, the above-mentioned 8,500 tons of orders have all been blocked. At a time when Shanghai is short of food and rice prices are high, the impact is extremely serious. In addition to the fact that various foreign firms have telegraphed for release, we take the liberty of sending a letter requesting that the Consul consider the extraordinary needs of the people of this city and quickly telegraph the Vietnamese government to allow the release of the order immediately. Now that new rice is being launched in Vietnam, if it cannot be helped, please delay it for a month and change to new goods, or it is also possible to replace No. 1 rice with No. 2 rice that is allowed to be exported. We sincerely hope that you will grant our request.</p>
<p>All Parties Voluntarily Donate Food to the People</p>
<p>Yu Qiaqing suggested advancing funds to purchase 200,000 bags of Saigon rice as a base. As needed, sell some and buy some more in an endless cycle to prevent panic and stabilize the market. The regulations for establishing a public warehouse stipulate the amount of grain that each group should purchase and store. According to news from the banking industry, the Banking Association and the Money Industry Association believe that establishing a warehouse to store grain is a matter of urgency. In addition to agreeing with Yu's suggestion, they have resolutely decided to generously store 50,000 bags of grain. The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce yesterday issued a notice to various industry associations to assist in the continued relief efforts for cheap rice. Dafoe Foreign Firm is currently entrusting the Price Evaluation Committee to distribute 93 bags of broken rice and 49 bags of corn to support charitable causes. The French Municipal Council prepared a car on the 6th (Friday) to distribute this rice to six charitable organizations, including the Salvation Army. The distribution was supervised by two members of the French Concession Volunteer Corps, Schibaike and Plame. We hope that all parties will follow suit and increase assistance to benefit the disaster victims.</p>
<p>How Are the Advantages and Disadvantages of Collective Grain Storage?</p>
<p>The previous report mentioned that advocating grain storage may affect the value of Vietnamese rice. According to Mr. Yu Zhiqin, Vietnam and Myanmar are world food markets. As far as the needs of Shanghai are concerned, the amount of transactions in this market is secondary and will not lead to an increase in prices due to orders from Shanghai. Yu also said that experts set up a group to purchase rice, fearing that it would promote group accumulation, and also advocated that group purchase of rice should avoid conflicts with merchants. The important purpose of group purchase of rice is for group orders, prepared for the use of large companies, factories, and schools, not for sale. After this measure is implemented, the city's reserves can be used for the common people, and rice prices will naturally be suppressed. Since the group purchase of rice is to avoid the actions of merchants stockpiling and manipulating, so as to stabilize the rice market, how can we avoid conflicts with merchants in the entire business? These two points are worth studying.</p>

During the dinner, members of the association, knowing Woodhead's unique views on the current situation, asked him to give a speech. Woodhead, who is also British, first expressed his admiration for the skills of the Royal Air Force personnel, and then said that there are still many people in the United Kingdom who are not concerned about the future of their motherland, which is clearly evident in Shanghai. Woodhead therefore urged democrats among the British community to rise up quickly and change this unfavorable situation, and to make a collective effort for all patriotic organizations and activities in Shanghai. All the members were deeply moved and vowed to fight to the end for the survival and safety of their motherland.</p>

The president of the association, Gelliland, gave a welcome speech. During the dinner, the guests talked and laughed, and the atmosphere was warm. Finally, Rear Admiral Glassford gave a reply, in which he expressed his gratitude for the warm hospitality of the association and said that the US Navy would do its best to help the United Kingdom. Since Rear Admiral Hurd, commander of the Asian Fleet, left Shanghai, Glassford's position has become very important. In addition to maintaining close contact with Rear Admiral Hurd, who is currently stationed in the Philippines, through telecommunications, he has full power to handle US naval affairs in Shanghai.

Japanese Commercial Buses Are Still Running. <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>According to foreign sources yesterday, Japanese military police continued to search Chinese residences within the blockade zone along Yidingpan Road yesterday, in an attempt to discover "nests of terrorists." The Japanese authorities have not yet released information on the results of the searches and the arrests made over the past six days. At the same time, there has been no official indication as to when the blockade and other restrictions imposed by the Japanese authorities in the western district of Shanghai will be lifted. Some quarters in the city expect that the blockade may be completely lifted at the beginning of next week, but this speculation cannot be confirmed. The Japanese authorities have now allowed food and other daily necessities to be sent to Chinese and foreign residents in the blockade zone, but all packages brought into the blockade zone must be strictly inspected.</p>
<p>Japanese Vehicles Run, Infringing Rights</p>
<p>Japanese commercial buses continued to run yesterday, charging 2 jiao, from the Paramount Hotel to Zhaofeng Park, after infringing on the patent rights of British commercial buses and tram companies earlier this week. The two companies seem to be waiting for the SMC to take action. According to a spokesperson for the SMC, after studying the protests of the British commercial bus company and tram company, the SMC may formally bring the matter to the attention of the Japanese authorities here. The spokesperson told the press that the Japanese commercial buses are operating on routes under the patented privileges of the Public Concession commercial bus company and tram company. This action directly violates the rights of the SMC, as this action must be approved by the SMC in advance. According to Mr. Lin, the acting spokesperson of the Japanese Embassy here, the operation of Japanese commercial buses in western Shanghai is only a temporary measure to meet the needs of the majority of people in the area.</p>
<p>Route Charts Posted Publicly</p>
<p>Yesterday marked the end of the first week of the Japanese blockade of western Shanghai. Regarding the situation in and around the blockade zone, a reporter from the Dazhong News Agency visited the area again yesterday. At the Jing'an Temple Road intersection and near the Paramount Hotel, the so-called "Shanghai West Citizens' Commercial Bus Company" not only set up ticket offices with tables and chairs, but also posted a route map of the "Commercial Bus" on the wire mesh frame. The routes are: "Route 1" from the Jing'an Temple Road intersection to Dunxin Road Columbia Road; "Route 2" from the Paramount Hotel directly to Zhaofeng Garden. Except for Yidingpan Road, where passengers can get on and off, there are no stops at other places. Only those who take a "bus" can buy tickets to enter at the Jing'an Temple Road intersection and the Paramount Hotel. Chinese and Western students can enter and exit freely, but others are still prohibited from passing through. There are the most people entering and exiting Qianjia Lane because the wire mesh has been removed there, and the inspection is relatively relaxed, so it has become the only channel for the settlement to enter the blockade zone.</p>
<p>Many Restrictions Still on Residents' Entry and Exit</p>
<p>The three places where citizens are allowed to enter and exit can now carry food in and out, so the panic about food and fuel in the area has been somewhat reduced. However, the alleyways in the Home Street and east of Yidingpan Road are still heavily blockaded and searched from time to time, as the Japanese are determined to eradicate the "terrorists." The current situation of each blockade line is as follows: (1) Jing'an Temple Road intersection; (2) Paramount Hotel (the starting point of the "commercial bus," only those who take the "bus" can enter, and all others are prohibited from entering and exiting); (3) Intersection of Jisi Fei'er Road and Difeng Road (except for teachers and students, passage is prohibited); (4) Intersection of Daxilu and Difeng Road (this place is exclusively for foreigners to enter and exit); (5) Intersection of Daxilu and Jing'an Temple Road (this place is completely blockaded); (6) Intersection of Yuyuan Road and Yidingpan Road; (7) Intersection of Daxilu and Yidingpan Road; (8) Intersection of Yuyuan Road and Qianjia Lane (the above three places are so-called open places, and citizens and those who take silver cars and self-provided cars can enter and exit); (9) The north and south ends of Yidingpan Road (the ends are completely blockaded, and the north end can enter and exit).</p>

<h3 id="e85">Portuguese Ship Transports Huge Amount of Silk Cocoons to Shanghai, Japanese Obstruct Unloading, 1,000 Bales Unloaded Worth 250,000 Yuan, Rumor Says Japanese Navy Was a "Misunderstanding," Goods on German and Italian Ships Are Also Often Hindered by Japanese <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>The "North China Daily News" reported that the Portuguese ship "Santa Anna" was unloading 1,000 bales of silk cocoons worth 250,000 yuan on the Bund outside the French Concession yesterday (the 6th), when it was suddenly interfered with and detained by the Japanese naval authorities, preventing it from leaving Shanghai as scheduled yesterday afternoon. The reason was that the "Santa Anna" was carrying silk cocoons and other goods from the mouth of the Yangtze River for Chinese merchants and arrived in Shanghai shortly after midnight on the 5th, berthing in front of the floating pier on the Bund of the French Concession.</p>
<p>Half an Hour Later</p>
<p>When the unloading of silk cocoons began, eight Japanese sailors and a petty officer arrived in a motorboat, boarded the "Santa Anna," and prevented the unloading of silk cocoons. The comprador of the ship had preliminary consultations with the Japanese soldiers on board, but there were no obvious results. The Japanese side obstructed the unloading of the goods, and the reason was unknown. Later, the cargo owner, the shipowner, and the Japanese naval authorities repeatedly discussed the matter for a long time, and the Portuguese Consulate was also informed. It was not until the afternoon that the goods were allowed to be unloaded. According to reports, the "Santa Anna" is the third Portuguese ship in recent months to have its unloading obstructed by the Japanese naval authorities. The first was the "Santarem," which recently carried cotton from the mouth of the Yangtze River to Shanghai and was also obstructed when unloading in front of the floating pier on the Bund of the French Concession. The second was the "Ave Maria," which also encountered the same difficulties and was released after several days. The "Santa Anna" has been sailing along the Chinese coast and originally sailed between Wenzhou and Shanghai. A few months ago, the Japanese tightened restrictions on coastal shipping and changed to sailing downstream of the Yangtze River, which was obviously not a small port subject to the ban on navigation. Before leaving Shanghai, it also obtained a bill of lading from customs. Furthermore, foreign ships carrying goods from coastal ports adjacent to Yi to Shanghai have been detained by the Japanese on several occasions. For example, two German ships and one Italian ship were seized by the Japanese after arriving in Shanghai, and the shipowners paid huge "fines" before they were released. Also, the English "China Press" reported that, according to port authorities, the Japanese Navy detained the Portuguese ship "Santa Anna" due to a "misunderstanding."</p>
<h3 id="e86">The Entire Shanghai Silk Industry on the Brink of Collapse; "Construction Donation" Unbearable; Silk Industry Peers Plan to Cope <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>Since the cocoon production areas of various counties in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces were controlled by the Japanese, the Chinese silk factories in this city have gradually felt the lack of supply. However, in the beginning, a small number could still be transported to Shanghai indirectly, and the shortage could be made up with existing inventory. As the control became more and more severe, the source was interrupted, and the decision to shut down gradually became clear. According to a survey, the number of silk factories in this city purely operated with Chinese capital used to be more than sixty, but by the end of last year, only more than twenty could start work. This spring, it was reduced to just over ten. By summer, only six remained. Now, even these last six are reportedly ceasing operations. What was once relied upon as a major export is now entirely forced to shut down.</p>
<p>Rampant Exactions</p>
<p>At this time of the entire silk industry's decline, a certain party has set up "Regulations for Collecting Donations on Cocoon Silk and Raw Silk," starting from December 1 of this period (autumn season), classifying and reporting donations according to rates. The tax donation used to be 110 yuan per picul of raw silk, but now an additional "Special Construction Donation" of 370 yuan is required. Therefore, the current price per picul of raw silk, in terms of tax donation alone, requires 480 yuan. According to an inquiry by a reporter from Da Zhong News Agency, since the implementation of these regulations on the first of this month, very few silk merchants have gone to that place to "report donations." Consequently, they joined forces with the "Unified Tax Bureau" the other day and dispatched a large number of personnel, estimated to be over 300, to patrol around this city. If any raw silk is found that has not been "reported for donation," it will be immediately seized and forced to pay taxes according to regulations.</p>
<p>Convening a Meeting</p>
<p>Therefore, disputes have arisen frequently in recent days. The raw silk industry peers, unable to bear the harassment, plan to convene a meeting in the coming days to discuss countermeasures. The silk shops wholesale places in this city believe that since the source of raw silk has been subjected to rampant exactions, the cost of manufacturing silk fabrics will inevitably increase compared to before. To maintain the balance between capital and price and avoid losses, the only option is to increase the selling price to supplement the costs. However, since the prices of various goods in this city have soared drastically, the purchasing power of citizens is no longer as strong as before. Moreover, the largest customers of silk fabrics mostly belong to the property-owning class, and they are not essential items for ordinary people, unlike other goods that are more common. If prices are increased rashly, the merchants will inevitably wait and see, which will have a great impact on business. Therefore, they are particularly hesitant about this issue and may need to convene a meeting to reach a consensus.</p>

<p>The Zi Lin Bao reported that Navy Spokesman, Colonel Saito, claimed yesterday (the 6th) at a press conference with reporters that the Chinese guerrillas recently took advantage of the rainy weather to bury electrified landmines under the Nanjing Railway tracks near Suzhou. On the 29th of the previous month, an explosion destroyed five train cars. Nearby villagers were arrested within the past few days for assisting the guerrillas. After the incident, seventy-two to seventy-three people died and one hundred and twenty-eight were injured. They were sent to Suzhou hospitals for treatment, with only one military injury resulting in death.</p>

<p>The financial plight of the Jewish refugee relief organizations in this city is about to suffer a new blow. According to what was heard yesterday, their hopes for remittances from New York to Shanghai have vanished. According to people in the Jewish refugee relief organizations, there are about 14,000 Jewish refugees from Germany and Austria in this city. They used to have three free meals a day in the shelters. However, due to economic difficulties, it has been reduced to one meal a day. Now that no donations are being remitted from New York, these Jewish refugees will inevitably be more affected. It is said that the New York United Jewish Appeal is the organization that supports Jewish refugee relief organizations around the world. The Jewish refugee shelters and hospitals in the Hongkew District of this city almost entirely rely on donations from New York to survive. Now that no funds are being remitted, it must be because there is not enough to go around and it cannot be distributed. We can only step up fundraising in this city and save expenses at the same time to ensure that the refugees do not starve to death. Jews with financial means in this city should also provide as much relief as possible to supplement the funds. As far as is currently known, there are fewer than fifteen Jews in this city who regularly donate large sums of money.</p>

<h3 id="e94">Delayed Delivery of Ordered Steel Plates; Metal Company Sues for Compensation; Each Side Holds Its Own View, Court Orders Rescheduling for Further Review <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>Qi Shengquan, the owner of Yong Sheng Metal Company at No. 239 Jiangxi Road, who is from Ningbo, ordered 200 tons of half-inch thick, four-foot wide, and eight-foot long steel plates from the Belgian firm Huadelong Foreign Company on December 2, 1936, at a price of £10 5s per ton. On February 5, 1937, he reordered 20 tons of the same steel plates. After both parties signed the contract, Huadelong Foreign Company only delivered 135.5 tons, with 84.5 tons still remaining.</p>
<p>Delayed Delivery</p>
<p>Yong Sheng Metal Company believes that because the price of steel plates has soared in recent years, Huadelong Foreign Company sold the incoming orders to a third party at a good price, considering it a breach of contract. Recently, he entrusted lawyers Ge Bangqian and Zhang Lishi to file a lawsuit with the Civil Court of the First Special District Court, requesting the court to order the defendants, Luo Minghua, the Western manager of Huadelong Foreign Company, Tong Kuixuan, the manager, and Zhong Linshu, the salesman, to deliver the goods, or to order the defendants to jointly and severally compensate for the losses, totaling £797 7s 6d in silver. The court accepted the case and summoned the defendants through the Civil Court No. 3 presided over by Judge Ni.</p>
<p>Manager Luo Ming</p>
<p>Because he enjoyed consular jurisdiction, refused to appear in court. The third defendant, Zhong Linshu, also did not appear because he lived in the French Concession. At that time, only the second defendant, Tong Kuixuan, appeared in court through a lawyer. First, the lawyer representing Qi Shengquan, the owner of Yong Sheng Metal Company, stated the intent of the lawsuit, saying that although the contract for purchasing steel plates was signed by the foreign manager Luo Ming, the negotiation and pricing were all done by the second defendant, Tong Kuixuan, and the third defendant Zhong Linshu was also present. After the contract was established, the defendant only delivered 135.5 tons of steel plates, with 84.5 tons still undelivered. It was not that the defendant did not have the goods, but because the price of metals soared after August 13.</p>
<p>Prices Soared</p>
<p>The defendants sold the goods originally ordered by the plaintiff to others at a high price. When the contract was originally signed, the price of steel was £10 5s per ton, but now the market price has risen to £20 1s per ton. The defendant's breach of contract earned them a great profit, and the plaintiff suffered significant losses. Therefore, he requested the court to order the defendants to deliver the goods or compensate the plaintiff for the losses of £797 7s 6d. Next, the lawyer representing the defendant Tong Kuixuan argued that the defendant was the compradore of Huadelong Foreign Company, and according to the law, the defendant should not be responsible for fulfilling the contract, because the power of the foreign company was entirely in the hands of foreigners, and the contract was also signed by the taipan Luo Ming, which had nothing to do with the defendant. After reviewing the arguments, the court ordered the case to be rescheduled for further hearing on December 14.</p>

<p>The Jianghai Customs officers seized a large batch of gold bars on the British-owned Taikoo Company's New Beijing ship the other day, with an estimated value of around 2.6 million yuan. The details of the case are recorded below. The Jianghai Customs received a tip-off in advance, stating that a large batch of gold bars was being smuggled into Shanghai on the ship, and the location where the gold bars were hidden was also revealed. The customs dispatched a large number of Chinese and Western seizure officers to the ship on the other day when the ship arrived in Shanghai from Tianjin and docked at the Bund Wharf in the French Concession. They went directly into the engine room, intending to carry out the search. At that time, they were blocked by the Westerner managing the engine room. After the seizure officers negotiated with him, they dismantled the iron pipes in the room, and they shockingly discovered the gold bars hidden inside. After counting them one by one, there were a total of 40 bars, each weighing 10 taels, for a total weight of 400 taels, with an estimated value of around 2.61 million yuan. The seizure officers took all the smuggled gold bars to the Jianghai Customs for confiscation. However, when the officers seized the evidence of the gold bars, all the criminals related to the smuggling case took the opportunity to flee without a trace. It is now heard that the Tax Police Bureau is still investigating the main perpetrators of the smuggling.</p>

<p>Hua Guang News Agency reported that at around 12:45 PM the other day (the 6th), a French streetcar company's route one streetcar was traveling from west to east, when it arrived at the stop at the intersection of Avenue Albert, a passenger from Yangzhou, Meng Mingqin, who was over fifty years old, boarded the car at that location, intending to go to Hualong Road. He presented a one-dime coin, requesting a six-cent ticket. Unexpectedly, the ticket seller No. 28 on the car shortchanged him one cent. When Meng questioned him, the ticket seller became enraged out of embarrassment, replying that even if he cheated, it "doesn't matter," and began to curse and insult him. As a result, a conflict broke out between the two parties. The ticket seller then resorted to force, assaulting Meng in the face and other parts. At that time, all the passengers in the car stood up for Meng. Meng immediately got off the car, intending to drag the ticket seller into the police station, but he knew he was in the wrong and rang the bell, driving away quickly. Meng had no choice but to ask a passenger who was on the same car to accompany him to the Lou Ka Wan Police Station to report the incident, and went to the hospital to verify the injuries, requesting the police to investigate strictly according to the law.</p>

<h3 id="e103">Impediments to Japan's Southern Advance <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>Regarding Japan's southern advance policy and its impediments, this publication now translates and records reports from two major American newspapers, as follows:</p>
<p>(I)</p>
<p>Through the vigorous wooing of Germany and Italy, Japan has already signed an economic alliance treaty with them. We can well believe that if China were not holding Japan in check, Japan might have already joined the war.</p>
<p>Apart from Vietnam, the abundant resources of Burma and the Dutch East Indies are worth coveting. Germany and Japan once had a secret agreement that, when the time was right, the Dutch East Indies would be divided equally between the two countries, with Germany taking Sumatra, Singapore, and the Federated Malay States, and Japan taking Java, Dutch Borneo, and nearby islands. Since Germany's successful invasion of the Netherlands, Germany believes that the time has come.</p>
<p>However, Japan is currently in a predicament and therefore has a different view. China's resistance has not yet been broken. The Japanese army still has 1.5 million men mired in the quagmire of the Asian continent. After three years of arduous fighting, Japan's economy and finances have been greatly weakened.</p>
<p>The Japanese fleet is said to be the third largest in the world, with nine battleships. Although they are all over twenty years old, they can be deployed at any time due to repeated overhauls and improvements. In addition, there are five aircraft carriers, twelve new heavy cruisers, twenty-seven light cruisers, one hundred and twelve destroyers, and sixty submarines.</p>
<p>Britain is unable to strengthen its Far East fleet under the current circumstances. Therefore, if the United States is not fully prepared and unable to use force to counter any attempt to change the status quo of the Dutch East Indies, then in theory, Japan's naval power in the Western Pacific can be said to be unparalleled.</p>
<p>Again, theoretically speaking, Japan is quite capable of posing a serious threat to Australia and New Zealand. But in practice, Japan's position also has many shortcomings. First, Japan lacks naval bases outside the three islands of Fusang (Japan) to repair large warships. In fact, outside of Japan, the only first-class naval base in the Far East is British Singapore, which is three thousand miles away from Japan.</p>
<p>Singapore is well-defended and heavily guarded, and has become a strong fortress. But to conquer the Dutch East Indies or Australia, Singapore must be captured first. To achieve this goal, Japan must travel far across the Eastern Ocean and deploy most of its main fleet. If the United States intervenes at this time and attacks Japan from the rear, the Japanese army stuck in the quagmire of China will be in danger of having its sea transport cut off and will be trapped in a dead end. If we take a step back, if Japan does not avoid danger and is determined to fight, its most reasonable move would be to attack Sumatra and use it as a base to besiege Singapore.</p>
<p>However, the Dutch defense in the area should not be underestimated. Before the outbreak of the European war last year, the reporter made an on-site inspection and was deeply impressed by the air force strength and naval and land defenses there.</p>
<p>Another point is that if Japan first takes Sumatra, it would be tantamount to thwarting Germany's ambitions. Some say that Japan will first gain military control of French Vietnam and Thailand, and then move south to attack Singapore. Recent Japanese actions in Vietnam show that this strategy may be adopted. However, transportation in Vietnam is difficult and the climate is harsh. If it is to be controlled, it will inevitably take a long time and cost a lot.</p>
<p>Another target for seizure is, of course, wealthy Hong Kong. But Hong Kong has also become a strong fortress and will put up a strong resistance. Moreover, the Chinese army in the hinterland of China is growing in number. Once the Japanese army besieges Hong Kong, they will rise up and counterattack. Moreover, even if Hong Kong falls, it will not determine the final victory or defeat.</p>
<p>Japan may bypass the Singapore forts and the Strait of Malacca controlled by the British Navy, and send cruisers and submarines to enter the Indian Ocean through the Timor Sea to disrupt British maritime trade. Japan may even risk sending naval forces to establish bases in the ports of Italian East Africa to participate in the all-out war. However, these ports are neither good harbors nor have they already been bombed to smithereens. Moreover, Japan's air force is beyond its reach, and the fleet will be greatly troubled by British air raids on its long voyage. It would be too rash for Japan to send a powerful fleet far into the Red Sea. If only a small naval contingent is sent, the large British fleet stationed in the Eastern Mediterranean can draw a part of it across the Suez Canal to deal with the Japanese Navy.</p>
<p>In addition, Japan has only one plan left for a large-scale attack on Australia or New Zealand. Over the past two years, the plan to strengthen defenses in Australia and New Zealand has progressed rapidly. Australia has a huge army and air force to defend its homeland. The northern provinces of Australia are sparsely populated, and it would be ineffective for the Japanese army to land there. To truly threaten Australia, a large expeditionary force must land in the south, where industry and wealth are concentrated.</p>
<p>The total tonnage of Japanese merchant ships is only around five million tons. Import and export trade is the lifeblood of the Japanese economy. The army in North, Central, and South China must also be constantly supplied. It is already stretched to the limit to maintain military supplies with the entire merchant fleet.</p>
<p>The distance from the Japanese mainland to Australia or New Zealand is more than four thousand miles. Japan cannot increase the tonnage of merchant ships to transport fifteen divisions, carrying tanks, artillery, transport vehicles, and aircraft between the two.</p>
<p>So, judging the situation objectively, Japan's entry into the war can only have a holding effect. British commerce in the Indian and Western Pacific Oceans will undoubtedly be disrupted. But at the same time, Japan's own indispensable trade with the Dutch East Indies, Australia, India, and other places will also be completely lost.</p>
<p>The United States has now banned the shipment of aircraft gasoline and scrap iron to Japan. China's iron ore production is small and of poor quality. Japan can only obtain kerosene from the Dutch East Indies, and iron only from Australia and India. Also crucial is the supply of Australian wool, which will also be cut off. About half of Japan's overseas trade relies on the transportation of neutral countries, which will also be lost entirely.</p>
<p>Britain's lease of the Atlantic and Caribbean islands to the United States as defense bases is of great significance in the eyes of the Japanese. If the U.S. Navy can freely use the ports of Bermuda and Jamaica, it can naturally also use Singapore's first-class naval docks and arsenals and the well-equipped Australian Sydney naval port when necessary. The significance of this will be even greater. (Translated from a special dispatch by the New York Herald Tribune)</p>
<p>(II)</p>
<p>After the "upper-level revolution" of the Konoe Cabinet, Japan has smoothly transformed into a highly centralized state. The implementation of the total mobilization of national resources is, of course, influenced by the fruitless three-year war against China, but it is also an inevitable trend after adopting a new diplomatic policy.</p>
<p>Japan's current position is unexpected. To understand the truth, one must look back at the situation three months ago. The Japanese military had decided on two policies: the Tripartite Alliance and totalitarian politics. In July of this year, the Japanese military submitted a note to the government, advocating that it should strengthen its ties with the Axis powers externally and strengthen the national structure internally. The Yonai Cabinet fell because it rejected this proposal. If we analyze it to the end, Japan's new internal structure and external lineup are both because it was found that a fundamental reform must be adopted to end the war against China and pull itself out of the quagmire. Therefore, Japan's first goal is still to end the war against China.</p>
<p>This sudden turn of events in Japan was also influenced by the dramatic changes in Europe this summer. After the Netherlands and France were conquered, Japan's ambitions also expanded automatically. "Greater East Asia-ism" has replaced the "Japan-Manchukuo-China Bloc," which had been loudly advocated for a long time. In just three months, Japan has abandoned the political and economic system it had adhered to for fifty years.</p>
<p>Japan's military strength cannot be underestimated. Its navy, in terms of tonnage and firepower, can rival the United States. According to Tokyo military experts, the Japanese fleet has a geographical advantage, which can enhance its attack power. If it takes a defensive position, it is virtually invincible. Combined with the original three islands of Japan and the islands acquired later, the Japanese Empire has become a solid dike along the coast of East Asia, starting from the Bering Strait and ending in Tokyo Bay. The South Sea Mandate islands protrude like a screen, and can be said to dominate the Western Pacific.</p>
<p>Under these circumstances, the United States naturally does not intend to attack Japan. Japan also does not intend to attack the United States. However, if the United States decides to actively resist Germany, regardless of Article 3 of the Tripartite Pact, the Japanese government's position will inevitably fall into difficulty. If Japan recklessly attacks the United States, it will not only incur domestic criticism, but also have to abandon its strong defensive position and fight far away from its base.</p>
<p>As for the goal of the Tripartite Pact, it is to keep the U.S. fleet in the Pacific, or at least not participate in the European war. This is clearly a condition for Germany to indirectly assist Japan in building a "New Order in East Asia."</p>
<p>Japan's current strategy is to make China lose its fighting power in order to end the war against China. The Japanese Navy has stepped up its blockade along the Chinese coast, and its naval aircraft have reduced Chongqing to ashes. The communication lines between Chongqing and the outside world have been mostly cut off. The occupation of Vietnam not only closed French ports, but also can be used as a starting point for cutting off the Burma Road. Japan also wants to use German influence to persuade Stalin to close the last route for the supply of Chinese weapons (this has already failed).</p>
<p>Japan believes that these realizable assets are of sufficient value to form an alliance with the European Axis powers. But one side is assets, and the other side is liabilities. Japan's economic ties with Germany are ridiculously small compared to the trade it needs with Britain and the United States.</p>
<p>Therefore, the new alliance formed by Japan, although it has various superficial benefits, is actually a gamble. Japan is betting that Germany can win in Europe without Britain deploying its full strength and U.S. aid. It is guessing that the United States, because it is unprepared, can only maintain strict neutrality and wait for Germany to complete its goals. However, once Article 3 of the alliance is implemented, Japan will feel greatly troubled. The war will destroy Japan's trade with the United States, and Japan's commercial markets within the British Empire will be uprooted. As for finding alternative markets and sources, they only exist on the paper of the "New Order." Every Japanese family and every industry will feel the impact of the war. Japan has already lost its profitable foreign trade, and the "New Order in East Asia" will only spread poverty. If the U.S. and British navies cooperate in the Pacific, the benefits Japan has gained will be like sand, unable to be consolidated.

<p>(Laiyang Correspondent) The Hunan Provincial Education Department believes that vocational education should pay attention to practice, so that students can master manufacturing technology and increase social production. The first priority is to expand factories and increase tools. In accordance with the Ministry of Education's Measures for Subsidizing Production Funds for Vocational Schools, a production fund of 8,000 yuan was subsidized to senior industrial schools, and vocational schools were instructed to establish production organizations. Since its implementation, it has achieved considerable results. However, other provincial vocational schools have not yet been able to expand factories and establish production organizations. It is reported that the Education Department plans to find ways to enrich them next year.</p>

<h3 id="e116">Boldness and Carefulness <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>— Huang Lin</p>
<p>Boldness and also Careful, what does that saying mean? On the surface, it seems contradictory, impossible; children must also think that to be bold, one cannot be careful, to be careful, one cannot be bold. This is because we misunderstand the meaning of boldness and carefulness, and do not understand the relationship between boldness and carefulness.</p>
<p>The boldness I am talking about is not just relying on temporary courage and acting rashly, but when facing dangerous things, not panicking, and when encountering temporary things, being able to adapt to the situation, even if there are difficulties in peacetime, thinking of ways to overcome them, and acting with purpose and planned action, doing things step by step.</p>
<p>The carefulness I am talking about is not worrying about everything, fearing obstacles, fearing not being able to succeed, and not putting things into practice, wanting to escape reality, but paying attention to everything when facing things, not being careless, not being negligent, so as to reduce errors and make it easier for the cause to achieve success.</p>
<p>Therefore, boldness is the driving force for implementing or dealing with anything, and carefulness is the attention that should be paid to carrying out a cause. The two have a close relationship. If one is only bold and not careful, one is likely to encounter setbacks and difficulties at any time, or unexpected dangers. If one is only careful and not bold, one cannot do great things and cannot cope with sudden changes.</p>
<p>When we understand the above meaning and relationship, we will no longer feel the contradiction between them, but feel how important they are to our lives. We are in this rapidly changing era, and we are constantly threatened by dangers and troubled by huge difficulties. Our parents cannot always be there to protect us, and our teachers cannot always be there to supervise us. If we are not bold, we will learn to create fear everywhere. If we are not careful, harm can easily occur, and we will not be able to cope with unexpected events.</p>
<p>Children, let us train ourselves in peacetime, starting from small trivial matters to walking and learning, so that we can become a bold and careful child of the era.</p>
<h3 id="e117">After Watching the Film "Young Edison" <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>— Su Ming</p>
<p>Last Sunday morning, Yong'er's father took his two brothers to the Dahua Cinema to see the film "Young Edison." Yong'er originally didn't really like watching movies, often dozing off in the dark cinema. However, after seeing this film, it aroused his interest, and he watched the whole film in one go without feeling tired at all. On the way home, he even asked his father to take him to the movies often. His father then said to him, "This kind of film is most suitable for children like you and is worth watching. But what are your thoughts after watching this film today? If not, I won't bring you out to watch it next time."</p>
<p>"Yes, yes," Yong'er said preemptively, because he hoped to go out to watch movies again next time. "Edison was the naughtiest child ever, Dad. Although we are naughty, we are not as naughty as him. He didn't study hard and caused trouble at school, and he was expelled from the whole school. I haven't done any of these things. However, Edison was very filial to his mother. When he heard the news that his mother was sick, he immediately rushed home to assist the doctor with the operation. He even came up with the idea of combining many kerosene lamps to reflect the light from a mirror to his mother's bedside to make it easier for the doctor to operate. He was really extremely clever. Moreover, he was also brave and dared to rescue passengers on the train. If I were there, I would have been very anxious. This is also where I am not as good as him, Dad, do you think so?"</p>
<p>"You're right, good, let your brother speak."</p>
<p>"Edison's childhood experiences were the worst possible. He was looked down upon by others and even called a mentally ill child. However, he was not discouraged by this and continued to study his scientific gadgets in the basement. He also liked to work. He worked as a vendor selling candy and newspapers on the train, and at the same time, he studied science on the train. Later, he even printed, edited, and sold his newspapers himself. This kind of work was so hard! However, he didn't find it difficult but thought it was very interesting. This spirit is worthy of our admiration."</p>
<p>"You said it very well. Let me speak last, listen to me: Although Edison was a naughty child, he listened to his mother very much. After being expelled from school, he studied on his own, and his mother often gave him guidance. Therefore, half of Edison's knowledge came from his mother's teaching, which led him to become a scientific giant. Therefore, you two should listen to your mother's words. Edison was able to invent various things, such as electric lights, movies, telephones, phonographs, etc., because he encountered countless difficulties, obstacles, and failures. However, he was able to endure and persistently research the reasons for these failures, making improvements again and again until he achieved final success. He didn't use the method of blindly studying books to research science but used various experiments to compensate for the shortcomings of scientific research. Moreover, when he worked, he always thought and constantly experimented to see if the facts matched what the books told us. If something didn't match, he would research the reason for the mismatch. This kind of research is effective. You usually suffer from this problem, always thinking that what is said in books is absolutely accurate, so you don't use your brains to think and don't experiment anymore. This kind of reading has very limited progress. The thoughts you two have shared today are quite good. I will take you to see the great Edison again next time." It can be known how hard Edison worked in his adulthood, which led him to make such great contributions to the whole world!</p>
<h3 id="e118">Poor Children Without Winter Clothes <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>— Ying</p>
<p>The weather has entered the cold winter, and the climate is getting colder day by day. Everyone needs winter clothes! However, in Shanghai, this city, there are many people who still don't have winter clothes. In particular, there are many poor children whose winter clothing problem has not been solved yet! How pitiful this is! Ordinary children are already wearing coats and woolen sweaters, but those poor children are either wearing thin summer clothes or covering themselves with things like burlap sacks and straw mats as protection against the cold. If the merciless northwest wind continues to press down, they will not be able to survive this winter!</p>
<p>People who have clothes to wear will not know the suffering of people who have no clothes to wear. In the past few cold days, haven't many homeless people died on the streets every time? Although some of these deaths are due to other reasons, being frozen and cold is at least a major reason. Adults are like this, and children are naturally no exception. If the winter clothing problem is not solved, countless poor children will surely die from cold and starvation this winter. Children are the future masters of the country. The wrongful death of a child causes the country to lose a portion of its vitality. Therefore, this problem is quite serious and urgently needs to be solved!</p>
<p>Okay? Now, the Shanghai branch of the China Child Welfare Association has launched a campaign to solicit winter clothes for refugee children. Perhaps every child knows that the China Child Welfare Association is the only child welfare organization in China. After "August 13th," although it withdrew to the inland, it still has a branch office in Shanghai to carry out various child welfare work. It is truly benefiting poor children a lot. Regarding winter clothes for refugee children, they have held many events in the past. After the winter clothes are donated, they are made into cotton-padded clothes and distributed to poor children in various districts, such as refugee children, homeless children, and children in slum areas. However, in today's world of high prices, making a set of cotton-padded clothes is no longer the same as before. Cotton costs two yuan per catty. Last year, a set of cotton-padded clothes cost two yuan, but this year it costs six yuan. Therefore, the need for donations is even greater than in previous years. It is hoped that ordinary children can save various unnecessary expenses and actively donate. In addition to donations, old winter clothes are also needed. Many students have already started soliciting donations. It is hoped that children who have not participated will donate quickly so that they can save some poor children. It is truly a great benefit!</p>

<p>Sealed distillation of coal produces black viscous coal tar. Further refining of coal tar can produce many useful substances. Some are fuel oil, and some can be used as explosives. Carbolic acid for making medicated soap, beautiful bakelite, many kinds of non-fading dyes, indanthrene blue, mothballs, aspirin, etc. can all be made from it. Coal is really useful.</p>

<p>— Min</p>
<p>I received so many gifts in Honolulu that I could hardly keep track of them in my math lessons. Among them were black-haired Chinese and Japanese dolls, hula dolls wearing grass skirts, boxes of candy, rainbow-colored parasols, paper fans, surfboards, slippers for wearing at home, and all sorts of other things. Duke Kahanamoku of Honolulu signed his name on one of my surfboards and blessed me. He was a very famous and talented swimmer.</p>
<p>The naval officers in Honolulu took me to play on their warships docked in the harbor. They dressed me in a white uniform and called me "Rear Admiral Shirley." I also learned a real hula dance on Waikiki Beach, which was so much fun!</p>
<p>However, while I was having a lot of fun in Honolulu, I received some sad news. It turned out that the great star, poor Will Rogers, had unfortunately died tragically in Alaska. They notified my mother by telephone, and I cried incessantly when I heard. I loved Mr. Rogers very much, and my mother said that we would never see him again from now on. (The End)</p>
<h3 id="e121">First Place in Elementary School Summer Homework Competition <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>My Teacher Zhou De Su, First Temporary Elementary School, Bureau of Works</p>
<p>My class teacher is Teacher Wang. She has a round face, curly hair, lively, speaking eyes, and walks very lightly.</p>
<p>Every time after the class bell rings, she walks in with a smile on her face and lectures very clearly. But sometimes, after class starts, we are still talking. When she comes, she shows a serious expression and remains silent. This silence means that Teacher Wang is angry. We all sit upright, and the students who broke the rules lower their heads even more.</p>
<p>Teacher Wang's lectures are very organized, so every student welcomes Teacher Wang's lectures. When lecturing, the teacher likes to use metaphors and likes to tell interesting stories. Sometimes, one sentence makes the whole class laugh heartily.</p>
<p>When we do well in our homework, she praises us and tells us stories. But when we don't work hard, she punishes us.</p>
<p>When we make mistakes, she often guides us, explaining the whole thing to us in a clear and organized way, so that we know where we are wrong and voluntarily correct ourselves. But if some students are not firm in their will and go out to play with wild children, they often make mistakes again and again. Then, she punishes them. But if that student is willing to correct their mistakes, the teacher still forgives them. Therefore, none of our classmates does not love Teacher Wang, and none of them is not afraid of Teacher Wang. I wish Teacher Wang good health and that she will always be a beacon for the children.</p>

<h3 id="e122">Thoughts on the "Young Edison" Film "Young Edison" Essay Contest - Parent Category <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>— Second Place Sheng Cha</p>
<p>"At the beginning of the 'Young Edison' film, there is a subtitle that says, 'This story of courage, perseverance, and struggle can be said to be the experience of anyone in an American village, and that person just happens to be Edison.'"</p>
<p>The discipline of a strict father, the love of a kind mother, the shallow knowledge of the school authorities, and the ruthless contempt of relatives, friends, and neighbors are almost the inevitable environment of every great person. Edison, as a weak child, actually had the great ambition to help the world. Although schoolwork was not his strong point, he tirelessly researched and experimented in the basement day and night. The results he obtained often caused jokes and were ridiculed by the neighbors, even regarded as crazy. Even his own father found it difficult to forgive him. Fortunately, he had a kind mother who understood him, comforted him, and encouraged him, and finally, he became the head of the world's scientific community and a great benefactor of modern civilization.</p>
<p>However, if we pay close attention, we will find that children of the same age as Edison at that time, regardless of nationality, almost all have a curious nature and an interest in experimentation: a good doll is suddenly dissected by them, separating its head from its body; a good clock is suddenly studied by them, leaving not a single piece. The father is so angry that he roars like thunder, and although the mother also regrets that natural objects are being wasted, she can still endure it, so she persuades and comforts him in every possible way and lightly reprimands him. I ask, when we encounter this kind of situation, should we also regard this child as the future Edison, blaming the father for not understanding and praising this mother as being able to understand the greatness of her child? I think if everyone watches this film "Young Edison" and doesn't examine the causes and effects carefully, and every parent believes that a world inventor has emerged in their home, and every child sees themselves as a great scientific authority, I dare say that in the near future, there will be no need for enemy planes to bomb, and we will see fireworks rising all over the city and rubble flying everywhere.</p>
<p>Therefore, parents who watch this film should pay attention to every tiny part. They should know that although Edison's father treated his children very harshly, he was established in society and had to take the safety of society as a prerequisite. He knew from his loving wife's explanation that his son was not just fooling around, but since his son had offended the public, he would never let him off easily just because he thought he was a genius. Therefore, behind his stern mask, there was often a faint smile: heavy whippings were not lacking in gentle caresses. This is an extremely lovable model father.</p>
<p>Edison's mother was also not just an ignorant woman who doted on her children. She carefully watched every move her son made in the basement. She understood that her son's thirst for knowledge was purposeful and that his experiments were based on evidence. Therefore, her understanding of Edison was not just blind maternal love, and her fury at the teacher's accusations was not just selfish defense. If we rely on Edison's biography, then when Edison dropped out of school, she personally</p>

<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>Jiangzi heard the word matchmaker and lay on the table, her face flushed, and said, "I don't want to, I don't want to. Master Zhang, don't joke. I want to be a monk in the future." The Confucian scholar said, "Monks are people who have left their families. Besides, there are no female monks. How can we allow a person like you, who can topple cities and ruin countries, to become a monk? There is no such thing in the world that spoils the scenery." As he said this, he turned to the beautiful woman on his left and said, "If so, aren't you surprised to hear what your sister says? She's still a child. You are all beautiful women. Haha, beautiful women and famous scholars complement each other." The beautiful woman held a small jade cup and only cared about slowly drinking from her cherry lips, her face pensive. Seeing the Confucian scholar speak to her, she said faintly, "This little woman has always respected her teacher's words, but today's words are somewhat disagreeable." Hearing this, the Confucian scholar couldn't help but be stunned and said, "How so? Did I say something wrong just now? I praised you for being as smart as ice and snow and praised you for being beautiful women. These are indeed sincere words. Not to mention the Songling area here, even in Jiangnan, if you want to praise beautiful women, you are the only ones. Besides, you are my female disciples, and I know your talented Yongxu. Seeking you in boudoirs, famous ladies, is still rare and hard to come by, let alone Zhangtai? If so, what do you think?" The beautiful woman nodded her neck and said, "Thank you for your kind praise, but I am ashamed to accept it. This little woman has been destined to be thin since childhood, and she has been reduced to the dust of the wind, flattering and smiling. When I think about it in the middle of the night, I feel like I am being pounded. How can I be called a beautiful woman? In the current situation, the government is losing control, and the world is restless. Seeing that the Central Plains is boiling and there is a danger of sinking, we need great heroes to come out to quell the chaos and defend against insults, and save the people from suffering, so that we can save this crumbling situation and establish a strange feat that will last for generations. The so-called situation creates heroes, and heroes are of course valuable, especially today. As for the teacher, he is of course Jiang Zuo Guan Yiwu, a peerless celebrity. But this little woman believes that we must not follow Tao Qingjie's return to the countryside and mark ourselves as bright festivals. When we seek the silk and bamboo of Xie Dongshan's Tao Qing, we must strategize to resist the enemy. If we do not have the skin, where will the hair be attached? If the mansion collapses, where will we be? Even if we want to improve ourselves, it is impossible. Does the teacher also think that this little woman is saying too much? I don't know the taboos, death is my sin."</p>
<p>(Three)</p>
<p>Since he had taught her for two years, it was no wonder that she absolutely did not admit that her son was crazy. I think the film should also show this fact, otherwise it will easily cause misunderstanding among the audience. Our conclusion on parental education from "Young Edison" is: Parents and children should be close. Parents should start with "understanding" when teaching their children. Unreasonable criticism and blind doting will hinder the development of genius.</p>
<h3 id="e124">Shangyin Fellow Drama Society Kunqu Opera Rehearsal <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>— Lao</p>
<p>Since the Xianke Society stopped performing, Kunqu Opera has truly become a lost art. Yu Zhenfei belonged to the Golden Age and occasionally rehearsed one or two excerpts, but it was not enough to satisfy the audience. Yesterday, the Shangyin Fellow Drama Society rehearsed Kunqu Opera, which was quite a spectacle. The author had the pleasure of hearing the beautiful performance, so I recorded it as follows: The show started at seven o'clock. The cast was composed of famous actors from the Xiannisha Society. The first excerpt was "Looking at Hometown," with Chen Hongnian playing Su Wu. His pronunciation was loud, his dialogue was clear, and his acting was also very skilled. Li Ling, played by Chen Yujiu, had a scholarly appearance. It is said that both gentlemen were performing on stage for the first time, and their achievements were quite difficult to come by. The melodies of "Secret Oath," such as Erlangshen and Jixianbin, were all mellow and moving. Hu Zhangjun played Li Longji, which was appropriate for his status. The third excerpt was the Small Banquet from the Romance of the Three Kingdoms, with Zhu Xieqing playing Lu Bu. His singing was bright and his appearance was handsome. "Good Date" was played by Zhang Ya Fu, who played Zhang Junrui and was able to fulfill his duties, while You Boqun's Hong Niang had a glamorous appearance and radiated brilliance. The twelve reds each had a graceful and delicate figure. Bei Zuwu played Shi Peng in "Jing Qin Ji," singing and acting skillfully and expressing himself realistically. The last two excerpts were "Kneeling Pond" and "Arguing Vinegar." Mr. Ge Qifu's Chen Jichang flowed with elegant charm, and Chen Run Dejun's Dongpo saw the coward and shivered, and was frightened by the lion's roar. He was both refined and erudite, and both solemn and humorous. "Arguing Vinegar" was a meticulous masterpiece by Yin Zhenxian and Ye Xiaohong. Its high level of achievement cannot be overstated.</p>
<p>Since the war, I have not heard songs for a long time. I was quite excited by tonight's grand event. Perhaps the existence of Yangchun Baixue is not in vain.</p>

<p>— Liang Hao</p>
<p>The United States recently made a war documentary in England—"London Can Take It"—which has now been completed. The film is set against the backdrop of the German bombing of London, writing about the calm response of the British. All the air combat scenes were filmed on the ground. The dubbing description is as humorous and witty as the "Safety First" video. For example, when the British army's anti-aircraft guns are set up, the strong beams of searchlights cross in the air, and the alarm sounds and bomb explosions are heard at the same time, the dubbing explains: "This is not a Hollywood dubbing effect, but 100% real goods." At the end of the film, the scene is of British planes flying in formation to Berlin, indicating that Britain can not only cope with Nazi attacks, but also fight back!</p>
