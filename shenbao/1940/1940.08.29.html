<p>社評</p>
<h3>英義兩國的爭衡</h3>
<p>今日的歐洲戰事，顯然是分別在北海與中東兩個戰塲上進行着，而分別以央德與英義爲作戰的主體。論其內容，同是英國與軸心國的爭霸，而其作戰形態以及發展趨勢則大異其趣。中東方面且遠較北海爲複雜，最近英德之間除却以大量空軍互相毀滅報復以及遲遲未見實現的閃電攻勢而外別無値得注意的情勢；在中東和地中海則索瑪里蘭戰事甫告段落，義屬利比亞與埃及之間又見緊張；義希糾紛尙未獲確切解決，西班牙的參戰復有如箭在弦之勢；繁複錯綜，令人有眼花撩亂之感。如果說北歐戰局自德國在西綫發動攻勢以來，範圍已縮小而集中，則中東的風雲，自義大利參戰之後，殆正在繼續蔓延和擴大。</p>
<p>極權國家對內的統治和威望，繫於其對外冒險擴展的成就，在資源貧弱的義大利尤其如此。若干年來，義大利的帝國願望曾向着三方面發展：東歐北非與西地中海，而允以獨占地中海爲其最迫切的要求。但考其事功，義國之於東歐、已因德奧合併及納粹勢力伸向多瑙河而遭挫折、其在北非與伊比利安半島，縱曾以國力爲孤注，却依舊只有局部的收獲，距離看恢復古羅馬帝國疆域的幻夢還遼遠得很。是以此度義國之參加歐戰，絕非僅僅配合着德國需求，主要的還是如何完成其擴展的企圖。在這一點上無疑德義之間存在着默契，而且德方也勢不得不以放任義國向地中海近東北非發展當做義國參戰以及退出東歐的代價。</p>
<p>這兩個軸心國家，目前正在駢肩作戰，並曾一再矢言其結合將歷久不渝，此際固不必武斷二者之間已存在有某種矛盾。但德國正以傾全力擊潰英國爲當前唯一目標，絕不願此外多生枝節以分散力量；而義方則更置重於地中海與北非霸權的取得，自紅海沿岸非　腹地以迄直布羅陀丹吉爾都是義國目的物、其作戰對象未必能僅以英國及其屬領爲限，而不擴大到其他國家。在這一點上，德義之間於默契之外實更存在着一種心理上以至戰略上的歧異，不是空言强調其步驟一致所能消弭的。試看法國納款之後，德國至今對伕並無間言，而義大利則不時斥責法力背信，且流露其對法的忿懣情緒。又如最近的義希糾紛，義方輿論極見劍拔弩張，而德國態度則頗爲持重，顯然不願見戰爭擴及巴爾幹以至影響到土耳其以及蘇聯的態度。日來義希關係縱已緊張到極度，但至今仍停滯於緊張的階段，且偶然還稍見緩弛，總之，尙未至爆發戰爭者未必不是德國從中加以運用的結果。又有如昨日所傳羅馬尼亞與蘇匈間之發生武裝衝突，亦顯非德國所願見；如果可能的話，德方一定竭力防範其擴大。</p>
<p>但是無論如何，地中海和近束的戰事趨勢，如果英國尙未能以壓倒的强力使義大利改取守勢，必然繼續趨向於擴大；即使愛琴海與亞得里亞海的風波倏成過去，亦必更轉而向埃及或阿拉伯半島蔓延。爲了使其東非屬領與本部獲得聯繫，義國必不惜以絕大代價準備衝破英國在蘇彝士運河和江海的封鎖；而英國爲了保護近東油源及地中海江海印度洋之間的門戶，也必然結集其在近束與地中海的全部實力以相周旋。軸心國在這方面的任務，大致是由義國單獨擔任的；比較實力，英國是一面而義國是全面，雙方海陸空三軍互見强弱，而驟難衡量其總和。義國在索瑪利蘭固已獲得初步勝利，其最後得失仍當視雙方在亞丁埃及以及直布羅陀的進退；此戰將要判斷地中海霸權之究竟誰屬，同時也可以決定大英帝國一半的命運。</p>

<h3>防區問題暫沉寂　美堅持公允辦法　對中區不容許日方接防　商團輸流巡弋治安無慮</h3>
<p>本月中旬、各國防軍司令會議議決、丁區由日軍接防、乙區歸美軍接防、詎日方爲堅持其英軍防區全部接收之要求、迄今拒不進駐、以上兩防區、遂由萬國商團第一隊及白俄隊分別佈防、以維秩序、但此項措置、僅屬暫時性質、將來如何、尙須視美日雙方外交談判結果而定、昨據消息靈通方面表示、美日雙方關於防區問題之析衝、現顯尙在華盛頓及東京進行之中、經過如何、雖難獲悉、但就交涉延宕一點觀之、則頗可明白日方堅欲接收整個英軍防區之野心、據一般觀察、美方或不致再作讓步、必堅持公允的支配辦法、因如乙區亦歸日方接防、則對租界局勢及英美權益·均屬可慮、</p>
<p>丁區近狀</p>
<p>自英軍撤退後、丁區防務、卽暫由萬國商團白俄隊接替、記者昨赴該區視察、見大西路英軍兵營、現有白俄團員五六十名駐紮、並有大批中西巡捕協助、但因人數尙與前駐英軍相差甚鉅、故防務方面、不無空虛之感、至前英軍駐防該區時、在憶定盤路·愚園路·大西路·憶定盤路·白利南路底·及安和寺路底等數處、均築有高大沙堡、以資防禦、現此項沙堡、大部竟不知爲何方拆毀小部傾圯一旁、沙礫滿地、日方對丁區雖拒不接防、但日方勢力、確已逐漸深入、大西路會樂宮賭窟、現改爲日憲兵司令部、有日兵四名駐守、愚園路·憶定盤路·及大西路憶定盤路等交叉只、昔日均有租界巡捕及「警察」雙崗指揮交通者、今則僅見「警察」兀立駐守、</p>
<p>無新發展</p>
<p>日大使館發言人、昨在招上新聞記者席待、對同盟社所發消息、謂重新分配上海公共租界之防區問題、將就地解決一節、稱渠尙未接得來自東京方面之正式報告、故不能證實云、查同盟社所發之消息稱、東京外務省發言人、在招待西報記者席上聲稱、防區問題、純爲地方問題、故應予就地解決云、此間大使館發言人、經記者詢問上海目下有吾任何談判進行時、答稱、渠對此問題、暫不作答、待最近之將來再予答覆云、美海軍第四聯隊當局、對於此事、昨日並未有所發表、</p>
<p>商團駐防　具重要性</p>
<p>字林西報云、公共租界「乙」防區、近因英軍撒退、改由萬國商團暫行接防、查商團團員乃本市商人、內有若干人、供職外商商行、尤其是範圍較小之商行者、欲離職出防「乙」區、其行主不願予以必要的便利、而認商團團員出防、乃以重負加諸彼等、實屬不公、</p>
<p>關於此事、昨（二十七日）據工部局總辦兼總裁斐利溥聲稱、商團今在「乙」防祖任之職務、具有極大重要性、工部局固極明瞭不宜請商團從事對公益非必要的任何工作也、尙望各行主與工部局合作、使其所雇職員之加入商團者、易於離職、以便進行防務、按防軍司令委員會新近會議、</p>
<p>決定計劃</p>
<p>將「乙」防區移交美海軍第四陸戰隊、日方委員提出反對、當時一般人以爲日當局將要求委員會再度集會、以便討論日方提出之反建議、惟昨悉日方迄未要求防軍司令再度會議、又上海泰晤士報云、萬國商團A字大隊駐防「乙」區、已歷一週、昨晚八時、由商團騎兵隊與鐵甲車隊瓜代、不足一週後、或將由A字大隊調防、</p>
<h3>警務聯絡　遏止暴行　兩租界及日方等　組警務聯絡委會</h3>
<p>英文大美晚報云、上海領事團於八月十二日致牒工部局總董凱自威、載明領事團通過關於上海恐怖活動問題之決議案、凱自威昨（廿七日）乃在工部局會議室召開會議、日領事三浦·傳筱庵·與法租界警務處莫萊德（代表刻離上海之總領事歐仁）均列席、</p>
<p>會議決定</p>
<p>會議於午後三時開始、決定由四方警務當局組織聯絡委員會、以期集中力量、合作戢止上海之恐行怖動、建議中聯絡委員會、</p>
<p>集會次數</p>
<p>或將每月至少集會兩次、以討論有關警方分別採行之步驟、而決定何種聯合計劃、據消息靈通人士聲稱、苟各方合作推行、則此舉對於防杜暴行、當大有進展、</p>
<h3>教會醫院被炸　美將抗議　正等桂林報告</h3>
<p>關於桂林美國浸禮會所設醫院被日機炸燬事、昨據本埠總會秘書史美士談、關於此事、因此間所獲報告、甚欠詳細、故該總會已於前日致電桂林該院探詢詳細眞相、但迄昨未獲答復、渠稱待接詳細電復報告後、將轉請此間美總領署向日方提出抗議、</p>
<h3>收兌英金票　今日午夜截止　國府交涉展期二日屆滿　本市存鈔有限不生影響</h3>
<p>英國爲防止英鎊鈔券、爲德人攖取、輾轉流入中立國、運往倫敦、套取外匯、故決定禁止英票進口、但爲顧及中立國持票人利益起見、特給予相當期限、以便中立國將英鈔彙齊、寄往英國、上海方面自八月二十二日起、原定二十七日午夜截止、因國府交涉之結果、乃決定展期二天、今日午夜滿期、</p>
<p>本埠所存</p>
<p>英鈔、自歐戰發生後、已趨减少、多數收藏家、均已出手、故對本埠影饗有限、英鈔之海外流通、以法國北部最多、蓋德法交綏時、英軍開法赴援、軍隊餉需均發放英鎊、根據英法戰時通貨協定、英鎊可自由在法境流通、現法國北部淪陷、英政府爲防止大宗英鎊流入德軍手中、故實行禁止英鈔回國、世界歷史最久之自由通貨、亦因時局變遷、而施行限制、孤島喜藏外幣者、當有所警悟矣、聞滬港各地之英鈔、俟收兌期滿後、或有通融證明之辦法、</p>
<p>中國銀行</p>
<p>上海分行及英商匯豐·麥加利·有利·等銀行探悉、以上各銀行牧兌英倫鈔票、決展期二天、至八月二十九日截止、三十日晨起、不再收兌、中國銀行之收兌、照財政部法定價格折合、以昨日行市折合爲四十五元七角一分、今日收兌價格、則視匯率再行折合而定、惟爲顧全持券華人利益、凡華人持有英余票者、均可申請兌換法幣、並不予以限制、但英商各銀行祇限於往來各戶兌換、</p>
<p>錢兌公會</p>
<p>原定昨日起停止英金票買賣掛牌、旋因銀行收兌展期二天、所以昨今兩日決照舊掛牌、三十日起、擬不再掛牌、昨日掛牌英金票收進每鎊爲國幣九十三元、惟半鎊一鎊之小票、則再抑低一二角不等、並因購買者已絕無、故無賣出之掛脾、至於英金鎊、因係金鎊、並非鈔票、所以市塲照常掛脾、錢兌同業則依舊辦理買賣、昨日起聞巳有若干小錢莊已拒絕收受英令票、</p>
<h3>西貢海防航綫　滬輸已停駛　越南局勢漸緊　廣州灣亦停航</h3>
<p>近日越南局勢、日趨緊張、謠諑繁興、越當局爲防範起見、有自動封鎖海防西貢等沿海口岸之說、是否實行、尙無確息、聞港越綫航輪巳中斷、本市行駛滬越綫之太古怡和兩公司船隻、亦奉港行電令停駛貢防、</p>
<p>各輸駛港</p>
<p>故原定今午由滬赴海防之怡和洋行明生輪、至香港爲止、太古公司慶元輪、本定明晨駛防、今亦改駛海口爲止，廣州灣已停駛、厦門香港照常兼灣、怡和洋行泰生輸、預定九月三日自滬赴港、仍定駛海防、能吾成行、須視屆時局勢而定、太古公司山東輪於二十五晨自滬駛防、兼灣厦門·香港·海口廣州灣·預計明日到港、今已令停駛廣州灣及海防、該輪此次運防貨物甚少、共祗二十餘件、屆時在港上棧、</p>
<p>越局漸緊</p>
<p>據航業界方面消息靈通者稱、各輪公司於聞得越南時局緊張後、曾電越方查詢、昨晨均已獲覆、謂時勢不佳、各輪緩駛、但據木埠法國郵船公司稱、「該公司迄未接得海防方面之任何關於時局電告、業於二十五日直放海防之法郵西江號、約三十日可抵目的地、公司方面未接仟何意外電告、</p>
<p>航機班期</p>
<p>又昨據平明社記者向英國皇家舫空公司本埠辦事處探詢、據稱、邇來因時局關係、歐亞綫航空班期、呈無秩序狀態、該項班期本每週兩班、由香港起飛、經曼谷轉星加坡、再至歐洲、惟現因時局緊張、班期不定、且甚爲稀少、故本埠人土欲購該航空公司之客票者、向本埠辦事處接洽後、尙須山該辦事處再電港方、費時甚久、至港越航空綫、向由法國航空公司担任、</p>
<h3>公共租界　掉換通行證　十月一日起舊證作廢</h3>
<p>公共租界工部局以滬戰發生時、警務處所發之宵禁通行證、迄今三年有奇、未予另行核發、流弊殊多、故於昨日發出通告謂、「本局警務處以前所發宵禁通行證、自本年十月一日起、一律作廢、另行核發新證、每張收費國幣兩元、但須經警務處、認爲確有領證需要、方准發給、請領新證、須向福州路一八五號警務處第三一〇號辦公室索取空白陳請書、填寫申請等語、</p>
<h3>馮執中　昨遭槍擊受傷　臀部中兩彈傷勢尚無礙　行兇者被捕擊中要害死　流彈擊傷行人五人之多</h3>
<p>昨日午後一時二十分、法租界內又發生一暗殺案、被殺者係中法聯誼會秘書馮執中、臀部被擊中兩彈、行兇者於事後騎脚踏車逸去、在西愛咸斯路被法捕房探捕攔住、當塲被探捕擊臂、茲經記者調查所得、分誌如次、</p>
<p>途遇狙擊</p>
<p>馮執中、廣東人、現年四十七歲、稅居於法租界亞爾培路五五〇弄（步高里）二十五號、會任本埠上海法文日報編輯旋卽辭去、現爲辣斐德路五七七號中法聯誼社秘書、但該會僅認係一會員、昨午一時三十分、馮乘坐人力車由外回家，途經亞爾培路五四六號門前時、突有着藍色工裝之男子一名、乘坐脚踏車、飛步趕上、拔出手槍、向馮射放、馮驟聞槍聲、捨車圖遁、行兇者猶追上放槍、兩彈中其臀部、當塲痛極踣地、血流如注、</p>
<p>崗捕追趕</p>
<p>時附近第一九五號崗捕聞訊、隨拔佩槍、趕到出事地點、行兇者見狀、乃乘脚踏車向亞爾培路愛麥虞限路東逃逸、該捕在嗚警笛、緊隨不捨、並開槍向其射擊、行兇者亦予還擊、迨趕到愛麥虞限路四十七號巡捕總會門首、適該會有若干法籍探捕、在內進餐、陡聞警笛、各皆拔槍在手、出外窺探、行兇者益形慌張、亂開手槍、</p>
<p>中彈身死</p>
<p>急由愛麥虞限路折入金神父路、再向西愛咸斯路圖遁、探捕仍緊隨不捨、至時行兇者再欲向探捕開槍、而子彈業巳用罄、及至西愛邨二號後門口時、適有法捕房第二六二六號公事汽車經過、目擊情狀、乃拔槍向其開放、當塲擊中背胸臂等部、遂由車上跌下、倒在一婦女身上、手中執有六輪手槍、</p>
<p>流彈傷人</p>
<p>該婦女係沈陳氏、年三十二歲、甬人、庽西愛邨十二號內、昨午携其子女由家外出、不幸遇此意外、頭部略微傷、子沈文祿、年十三歲、傷左脚、女沈月秀、年十九歲，傷腎部、另有行人兩名、一名姚佩珍、十歲、金山人、爲流彈傷脚部、一名何阿采、十六歲、本地人、流彈傷左背部、法捕房召到救護車、將馮與受傷各人、及行兇者均送廣慈醫院救治、行兇者因傷及要害、抵醫院時、已氣絕身死、馮傷勢無碍、行人中何阿采傷勢嚴重、現捕房正在嚴密調查馮之被殺原因、</p>
<p>馮之身世</p>
<p>查馮曾任中法戲劇學校校長、後又組織中法戲劇社、一度公演『嬰粟花」一劇、後該校與劇社無形解散、馮妻亦粵籍、</p>
<h3>工部局新設委員會　研究今後選政　商討選舉應否變更手續　聘阿樂滿等六人爲委員</h3>
<p>工部局昨（二十八日）晨發表之公報、預示該局將來選舉董事之手續、或將有所更變、蓋公報宣布、局方已請阿樂滿·費瑪加利·格勒斯·密却爾·梭維愛爾與安井源吾六納稅人組織委員會、硏究選舉手續、宜吾作何變更也、</p>
<p>現行章程　並不修改</p>
<p>工部局發言人、昨向西報記者吾認新成立之選舉委員會將修改現行之選舉法律一事、據稱、昨日成立之委員會、僅將研究選舉手續之若干細則、是否需要更改、以便使明年之投票、比較便捷、該發言人並稱、此項委員會、係工部局自動組織、並非如「陸新報」所稱、因本埠日籍居民之請求而成立者、關於日方報紙所稱「今年日籍額外董事三名選舉之失敗、由於若干投票章程之不完善、並稱工部局已同意修改此項章程」等云、該發言人指出新委員會對於現行之投票法、並無修改之權力、渠稱此項法律、爲上海地皮章程之一部份、由簽字國列强所訂、苟無各該列强之同意、不能加以更改云、至於該委員會何時將舉行其第一决會議、又選舉手續何點、將重加檢討、工部局並未說明、</p>
<p>內城公務人員　限制潛入租界</p>
<p>抗戰期間、公務人員藉故赴國外·租界·或淪陷區城、前經國府明令應予嚴加限制、以重職守、茲悉浙江省政府近因鑒於接近上海及日軍盤踞區域、間有公務人員並無特派任務、又未呈經核准、仍復私自藉故潛往、特再申令、　後凡屬本省公務人員、非經呈奉省府核准給證者、一律禁止前往名盤查機關應嚴密檢查、遇有前往上述各地之公務人員、查無省府核准證件者、得予扣留報　核辦、</p>
<h3>工部局副總辦　葛勃返英從戎　葛氏從政五年頗著勞績　愛好上海希望他日重來</h3>
<p>已提辭呈將於下有中旬離此</p>
<p>英文大美晚報云、工部局副總辦葛勃、頃已提出辭呈、或將於下月中旬離滬、投效英軍、聞葛氏擬從戎者已非一日、正式從軍時、諒可獲官佐銜、查葛氏服務工部局五載、克盡厥職、</p>
<p>成績蜚然</p>
<p>一九三八年初、斐利溥長假離職期間、葛氏卽代理總辦兼總裁、主持總辦室事務、時滬戰方畢、本市情勢混雜、故辦事尤爲艱難、近者、葛氏力謀改善、</p>
<p>本市米況</p>
<p>雖因內地無米運滬、致障碍重重、然葛氏之努力、獲有顯著成功、葛氏現年三十二、生長南非、至十八歲返英、肄業牛津大學、獲法律學位、卒業後、專攻經濟科、據葛氏今晨告記者稱、渠甚</p>
<p>愛好上海</p>
<p>一旦別離、能不黯然、惟葛氏含笑不願陳述其服務工部局五年來之經騐、唯稱、渠在上海、頗感欣快、當然希望他日復返、葛氏又謂、渠有一弟、留居美國而入美籍、近已赴加拿大投效英空軍云、聞葛氏之繼任人選、仍未決定、然工部局帮辦總辦納煦、希望最高、</p>
<h3>法總巡法日爾　由青飛滬　濮關要已大見痊可　總巡進行澈底調查</h3>
<p>本埠伕捕房總巡法白爾、原在靑島休假、自接獲暴徒六人意圖加害於代理總巡濮蘭要之消息後、卽由靑島乘飛機趕來、於星期二（二十七日）下午五時抵滬、離濮氏遇刺受傷之時間僅九小時、法氏抵滬後、卽銷假視事、據悉、渠對於空前未有之襲擊高級警務人員一案、將予以澈底之調查、至濮氏之情形、已大見進步、或將於周末出醫院、按法捕房人員遇刺之事、在過去一個月中已發生三次、最先爲俄探伊伐諾夫、繼之爲探長楊高斯基、此二人均已先後畢命、但此次襲擊高級警務官員之事、尙爲本市歷史中第一次</p>
<h3>老閘橋地貨業　昨竟無菜上市　浦東來貨被截菜價飛漲一倍</h3>
<p>本市菜蔬、除一部來自兩路沿綫外、向賴浦東眞茹·龍華·等地供給、但自去冬設「中央市塲」於光復路後、日方復在虹口設立「食料品卸市塲」、以致各項菜蔬、（包活蛋類·野味·及葷素食物）凡來目聞北·眞茹·江灣·吳淞·者、悉被攔去、僅浦東龍華一帶、尙可自由販運、惟經其統制後、菜蔬因剝削重重、致售價隨之飛漲五成、今春該「市塲」復在滬西設立「分塲」、故目下僅浦東一路尙無阻碍、</p>
<p>浦東地貨　又被攔截</p>
<p>因「市塲」轉手之貸物較之直接販戶昂貴、且多數貨物須早日繳款預定、故小本經營之攤販、均不願批購、而直接向菜農購買、「市塲」形同虛設、虧損甚鉅、茲乃進一步在南市東門路沿浦設立「南市分塲」、攔阻浦東一隅之貨物、</p>
<p>漲價一倍　空前未有</p>
<p>因各該「市塲」之統制攔阻、菜農無利可圖、致到貨隨之銳减、而抵埠各貨、均被該「市塲」全部統制、老閘橋本爲地貨集中之大本營、昨竟無菜上市、價格乃隨之飛漲一倍以上、計靑菜每擔售九元（連籃秤入而籃仍收回、原售四五元、則均除籃）、藕每百斤售十二元、（本售五六元）、冬瓜四元五角（原售二元五角）、職是零售價格、大菜售至每市斤三角、其他洋葱·韮菜·大蒜·茄子·洋蕃芋·等、零售價格、均漲一倍以上、實爲空前所未有、</p>

<p>外滙昨日市况、滙豐掛牌、爲無上落、英美滙　市、平中又告回鬆、乃因缺乏刺激消息、經營者動作遲緩、多數袖手觀望、少數投機商則忽進忽出、又因本月底將屆、多頭開始吐出、轉入下月期、故近期美滙曾硬至五元半可結、英滙亦隨見由緊回平、滙豐亦於美滙五元半時滿懷供意、惟此後因滙豐停給、買戶欲購、五元四六八七五亦感不易、迨近午刻、投機商冉反出爲進、潛勢回軟、收盤尙少變化、結果英金三辦士六二五、美滙五元四六八七五、比上日英平、美鬆〇六二五、期貨亦然、</p>
<p>進出未見熱鬧</p>
<p>晨初以倫敦大條、近升一一五、達漲〇六二五，紐約銀價仍平、倫敦生金呆定、滙兌英對美不動、對滬亦平、美對英小半分、對滬小更、對法無市、中央掛牌各滙如舊、銀行晨開現貨賣價、英金三辦士六〇九三七五、美滙五元四〇六二五、較之上日收市、英微緊〇一五六二五、美則平定、開後華商投機家稍有吃胃、市面穩定、計麥加利售予華商八月份美滙五元四〇六二五、又九月份五元三七五、滙豐掛牌揭曉勿動、白銀平衡稅揭曉增百分之一·〇〇、此後美行等雖吸、而一部份投機商忽來賣出、而滙豐斯時對美滙五元半、已肯供給、計華商投機家出大通曁日行八月份美滙由五元四三七五、做達五元半、但俄傾滙豐止塞、於是美滙五元四六八七五、亦告難結、後華商投機家復扒進九月份美滙、作爲五元四三七五、收盤結果英金三辦士六二五、美滙五元四六八七五，九月份英金二辦士六〇九二七五、美滙五元四三七五、比上日英命期現均無榮辱、美滙各長〇六二五、</p>
<p>香港匯市尚平</p>
<p>香港一十八日（週三）電、今晨滙市開盤告平、英滙現期貨及申滙現貨均無變動、美滙現貨鬆〇六二五、爲二十二元五六　五、日滙現貨長半元、爲九十六元、九時五十分申滙現貨升二元、爲四百十三元、十時〇五分平穩、美滙現貨回緊〇六二五、爲一十二元半、申滙現貨回降二元、仍爲四白十一元、十一時三十分平穩、美滙現貨再鬆〇六二五、爲二十二元五六二五、申滙現貨續降一元、爲四百十元、其餘不動、下午週三無市、</p>
<p>天津英美俱緊</p>
<p>天津二十八日（週三）電、今晨滙市開盤告平、英美滙現貨各緊〇九三七五、英滙爲三便士三二二五、美滙爲五元〇三一二五、申滙微降二角半、爲二〇八元半、「聯鈔」暗盤不動、仍站九十二元七角半、</p>
<h3>環境非純利多　金市漲風已息</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤買氣雖盛、漲勢仍受相當阻止、以隔昨午後塲外局面觀之、五千九百元大關、早已越出、本日晨初開盤、僅五千八百八十元、且開後因匯市報硬、金銀號等均吐售於市、尙賴港幫暗扒、及某錢兌業之補空、而得堅守於五千八百五十元之上、奈不久前昨一般多頭、見環境並非純屬利多、心思俱轉、傾向賣出者紛紛而起、證券幫多頭不時出籠、銀號亦拋、最低告五千八百三十五元、午收祗五千八百三十八元、較上日軋升八元、半日交易約二千餘兩、銀樓飾金終則不更、海關金等仍平、</p>
<p>烚赤以開盤為最高</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）、初開市勢堅穩、首由錢兌業進金號五十兩、爲五千八百八十元、比假前正式價好起五十元、嗣因金號幫傾向吐賣、雖斯時港幫居問吸收、但以外匯報鬆、浮多不時了結、故頭寸終感供過於求、未幾卽慘落六十元、銀號進銀樓業二十兩、降爲五千八百二十元、旋賣風稍息、且某錢兌業乘低補空、而港帮繼續暗中搜買、故不久重漲達五千八百七十五元、卒因另一錢兌業忽來吐塞、而證券幫多頭頻來出籠、又降小三十五元、銀號互做二十兩、退爲五千八百四十元、後賴金號稍扒、曾再漲十餘元、奈未幾賣風又起、銀號幫塞出尤多、但某錢兌業仍逢小補空、收盤前跌至五千八百三十五元、惟收市告五千八百三十八元、較本週一午收軋升八元、半天六十元上落、現金號之本牌金售出價、照烚赤較高十數元、收進减低三十元、現標金照掛牌金低五十餘元、均鮮做開、</p>
<p>首飾金仍懸六百元</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出、未見更動、大同行仍懸六百元、新同行與上價相仿、收進减低三十元光景、</p>
<h3>英鎊鈔票　在滬使用最後一日</h3>
<p>英金鎊票流通在滬大的分可拾鎊、五鎊、一鎊及十先令（即半鎊）、各錢莊稱五鎊十鎊者爲大票、一鎊半鎊者爲小票、而賣買價各有分別、報上所公佈者、爲大票行情、小票則低半元或一元、半鎊價更低、英銀行及中國銀行則沒有分別、故持票人欲賣出英余鎊票者、最先可至英國銀行詢問、例如匯豐銀行及麥加利銀行、待詢問價目後、可再至四川路各小錢莊詢問、比較何處最高則賣給何處、不過小票與大票要弄淸楚、按木人所知大票可賣給錢莊、小票祇可賣給英銀行、若持票人持有大數日之金鎊票者、可至英銀行代寄至倫敦、向英倫銀行掉換英匯、再匯至上海、費　二五之百分之一佣金、兵險費、及自英匯滬之費、算下比賣給各處都上算、不過要等二個月始可收到、再者才同銀行沒有商業來往關係的不能叫他們代收的、（炳）</p>
<h3>日鈔步漲</h3>
<p>昨日外幣市况、烚赤表面雖稍趨漲、然較二十六日塲外價則尙見跌、故英美余鎊亦各跌五角、英金票仍有少數交易、市價回起五角、美金票步落、晚市退爲十八元一角二分、比假前（二十六日）回跌二角三分、香港票需要殷切、市價猛漲、安南票及羅比·菲列濱·澳金票等均有需要、市價一致挺漲、日金票漲風未戢、晚市抬高至一元四角七分半、朝鮮票供求仍勻、晚市仍站一元零八分半原價、</p>
<h3>呢絨嗶嘰鑒別法</h3>
<p>— 志峰</p>
<p>呢絨嗶嘰身份，當然以重者爲貴，輕者爲賤，熟毛堅滑者爲上等，生毛粗鬆者爲下等，大衣呢類則相反，質輕爲上品，質重爲下品，因大衣呢加厚，紗多卽重而硬，毛多輕而軟，薄貨呢絨嗶嘰。皆知緊握團揑之後，全毛者無皺紋，毛多紗缺者皺紋亦缺，毛缺紗多者皺痕重重。但欲知紗毛方法，可將橫直各抽出二根，分別用火柴焚之，毛者有臭味，其灰燼團縮如球形，紗者　脚，無臭無形，此乃鑒別鐵證。但尤須注意者，花呢中常有夾色，一根毛一根棉紗混合而熾成一根者，故燃燒時必須先將，手大食二指細搓分開之，再焚。查呢絨織合大半均如「井」字，普通貸均紗十毛十，好者紗十毛廿，店員常向買客當塲將毛綫拉出，燃給客人看，而不將所夾之紗綫拉出，精明顧客，不加細別，而爲所欺也。「八一三」戰後，東貨呢絨大半均夾和有人造棉，人造梳輕柔而軟，粗視之與毛無異，倘不燃燒，單靠手揑，易於上當。</p>
<p>又看正反面之法，嗶嘰華特呢馬褲呢直貢呢等，最易鑒別，因共均皆斜花，穿着呢絨嗶嘰衣服者，俱知斜左者爲正面也。其他各種有花紋之花呢，如有夾斜紋路者亦均以斜左爲，正祇須牢記「人」字，一疋卽「丿」形爲正當，一納卽「　」形爲反面。尙有一個最佳鑒別法，不論厚薄各貨，不論日夜，俱可分辨出來，可取呢絨於手內持至與眉目相並，約離五六寸之譜，注意望之，光者為正，毛者為反，倘板四呢海力司火姆四本等兩面有毛的話，則其正面毛脚必短挺，反面毛脚必長睡而無疑耳。</p>
<h3>貼現軋升一元</h3>
<p>昨匯劃票據貼現率略升、每千元全日始終貼進三十七元、貼出須三十九元、軋升一元、錢業公會拆息勿更、早午兩市均掛一角六分云、</p>
<h3>證券　債市生氣蓬勃</h3>
<p>證券　盤市况、經過　日休假後、突又轉鋒俏、午前平穩、午後極爲踴躍、市價拾級上登、毫無回顧、與一十二日高價相差無幾、傳聞香港帮有大量需要、空氣頓好、市塲半氣又見蓬勃、數月來市場情形、每逢市價萎頓、則交易頓淸、市價上騰、則交易轉旺、此種現象、可以推知買進者時有大戶、賣出者則小戶居多、此層無可吾認、目下姑不以環境漸入佳境論、卽以檯面形勢推測、以籌碼之枯竭、人心之興奮、前途殊無小面、昨日上午交易、至爲有限、不過十萬左右之成交、但市價潛勢已見好轉、聯益同興久孚均有買進、怡泰仁昌益昌　出、午後聯益信孚繼續買進、極爲熱鬧、十六號及天生恒孚進胃亦不弱、雖同康鴻康聯和多頭斬結或拋　、市價竟仍逐步上騰、入後大豐順昌同興賣出、而鴻大生大信昌又有需要、價仍堅挺、故結果一致回漲四五角至八角半、成交總數約計八九十萬元、茲列表於後、</p>
<p>股票交易、成交中華書局股四十五股、價爲三十元零五角云、</p>
<p>又上海衆業公所報告云、昨日股市、開盤情勢不定、入後漸轉堅穩、當天波動、顯已不若前數日之大、成交極旺、收盤時實業與橡皮各股、買方俱佔絕對優勢、</p>
<p>倫敦二十七日（週二）電、今日中國外債及遠東英商各公司股票掛牌行市、英股梢有起色、匯豐銀行英倫註冊股升半鎊、爲六十二鎊半、香港註冊股不動、古拉客林傍橡皮股升三便士、價爲十四先令、其餘不動、</p>
<h3>糧食　米難操縱　一漲卽逝</h3>
<p>昨日洋米晨開依然緊色、賣方不肯輕脫、買方除本鄉店戶續有採辦外、內地幫亦有動動、加以浮囤散戶等心思交易、從中激盪、頓見奔騰、無論西貢火絞、竟超越評價一元有奇、但棧存豐足、未免顧忌、操縱過甚、反都棘手、因之市形轉呈疲色、出多進少、行情回短、收市已歸原盤、若一號陳西貢仍爲五十九元半、二號五十六元二角、五十六元、火絞五十九元二角、五十九元、小絞尖五十四元六角、五十四元、其他各貨亦均相仿、蓋終因缺乏實銷之後援相支持、卽原包英華司二號西貢一度喊六十三元半、二號這　喊轉棧六十五元、終以進戶觀望未能成交、而現米交易亦不過四千包、</p>
<p>昨日洋米又有少數釗滬、係太古公司濟南輪、自香港裝來六百零六包、昨晨抵滬、停靠法租界外灘本行碼頭起卸、（祖）</p>
<p>粳糯國米到貨雖屬有限、但傳聞塲內外明暗市交易因價盤已貴、形成供求相仿、未有榮辱、開金溧特元依然爲六十二三元、常丹白元六十一元左右、香港特兀六十二元半、六十二元、常幫鮮淸粳六十八元半、六十八元、常州蘇崑粳六十六元左右、次至六十三元、南港原包早稻六十四元、斛見大市六十二元半、决至六十一元半云云、</p>
<p>周浦新粳來源續斷、僅聞做開六担、價仍爲六十三元、</p>
<h3>日粉現跌期挺</h3>
<p>麵粉昨市現貨頗見平庸、因邇日洋麥洋粉有到、及本屆中秋節月餅汛中、實銷大非往昔可比、故華粉廠產量雖屬有限、銷量亦殊不多，統市成交福新及老車牌粉近四千包、廠盤仍爲十五元、至日廠粉市面、則現跌而期挺、鳳凰牌現貨十四元五角半、微跌五分、九月份—四元八角、十月份須十五元、成交的三千餘包、其餘內地粉及洋粉、雖有到貨、擯持未開</p>
<p>小麥昨市亦鮮精彩、查邇日虹口與閘北到貨、日有數千包、均限定解送日廠、對於華廠供應、依然困難百出、故華廠方面收價、終比日廠提高二元光景、其數量綜計不足千包、日廠進胃尙佳、送廠貨約有三千餘包、價仍站二十一元左右、</p>
<h3>紗花　大戶獲利出籠　棉紗漲後直瀉　最低九六三元收盤</h3>
<p>前日在騰之紗市、昨則開高後又復轉趨下風矣、此因全係投機者之做作、因連日上升、比低價時已漲起一百餘元、鑒於目前環境未見十分良好、如能獲利者、還不如到手爲財上策、所以多頭紛紛出籠、市盤乃迅速下降、惟有一部份心思仍屬看好、不過存貨日見增多也、</p>
<p>現紗晨開、承上日熱烈之人氣續進、同時多方乘機高抬、因之漲風頗銳、二十支雙馬開價爲九百九十元、但某某等之多額已在暗中吐出、氣勢已硬中帶軟、微跌至九白八十五元、然一般檯面上搶帽子之輩仍吃、多頭抬力尙足、詎料獲利者一致套出、徘徊多時、籌碼較鬆、迨至十一時左右、跌風　　，逐步下挫，連破幾關、由八十元至七十元、爲九百六十三元低價收盤、查半日間成交統計二千三百四十五包、行情二十支雙馬跌二十元、今日有一千三百五十七件棉紗運港、茲將各帮口買去之額量如左，同行一、四　〇香港九二五統計二三四五</p>
<h3>新棉狀况甚佳　印棉到四千八百件</h3>
<p>現棉情形又見冷靜、廠方除日廠偶有需要外、然付銀之期仍緩一二個月交解、同時紗價漲風、猶似曇花、一現卽逝、所以原棉人心又受了打擊、加之新棉產狀况、目前亦屬不惡、將後白露汛如無在暴之風雨摧殘可稱豐稔、於是棉市望平、本日做開現棉交易殊少、行情反帶疲象云、</p>
<p>外棉市價、紐約棉市，市况頗爲靜寂、因大衆之賣出、及一部份多頭了結、結果收盤價格較之上日降落三五磅音、印度連同預測、跌落二羅比半</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、昨日因紗價好轉、因之原棉交易、又呈活躍之狀、惟爲數不巨耳、日方廠商購買較形熱鬧、華廠則較靜寂、蓋因華廠一般存貨、較日廠豐厚也、</p>
<p>印棉四千八百件前晚到滬、係大英公司蘇日（Sondan）號輪由孟買裝來、前晚（二十七）八時到埠、停靠虹口華順碼頭起卸、</p>
<h3>疋頭　浮囤吐售　存價下落</h3>
<p>國布　昨布市以謠言漸熄、外匯放長、滬　綫之哈納輪又遭阻撓、致市氣鬆弛、浮囤不絕叶售、惟粵港幫需胃尙健、各布開盤平平、後市一部份跌價、每疋二角半至五角、本街成交粗布坯布二百餘件、粵港帮辦粗布斜紋色布近三百件、浙閩帮略辦色布粗布等近百件、烟台帮辦粗布終呢一百餘件、豫帮辦色布色斜三千餘疋、</p>
<p>東布　因實銷走勢不振、標金回降、一般浮多手貨稍見微利、卽起吐售、市盤乃轉趨下游、十二磅龍頭細布晨開卅三元〇五分、至午收盤跌落每疋一元、後市續跌二角半、至卅一元七角半收盤、四君子嗶嘰亦跌二分、每碼爲九角二分半、</p>
<p>出口　棉布今日有四百零七件運往香港、</p>
<h3>油市　食油交易甚盛　價又漲二元半</h3>
<p>昨油市塲中交易甚盛、蓋因產價回蘇、人心得力騰踴、不論生豆油一致邁進、結果比休市前又猛升二元五六角、交易標的首推期貨爲最、期現銷塲除本街園坊內地占三分之一外、其餘都見行囤皮球生意、共計做開膠州現生油八十件、價爲六十四五元、訂九月上半月內交　百件價爲六十三元五角、九月下至十月下三百五十件、價爲六十二元、烟台牛油訂九月上交二百件、價爲六十四元、靑島現生油五十桶、價爲九十元至九十一元、路貨妥千譜桶、價爲八十八元五角至九元、豆油成交膠州油五十件、價詳市價欄、靑岐油五十件、烟歧油五十件、江北油二十桶、大連油一百桶、及日華廠油三十桶、大有廠油二百担云、</p>
<p>桐油昨由天津來一千一百聽</p>
<h3>糖市　粗白轉昂</h3>
<p>昨日糖市公會劃盤、二四粗白現貨七十六元三角、老貨七十五元、忽接荷蘭來電報、三·一九、美金Ｃ.I.F.I.C.例、故人心易好漲上數角、新貨爲七十六元七角至七十七元、比上日升五角、老貨爲七十五元九角、轉口貨卽打單者六十元〇九角、六十一元二角、升七角、九月六日交貨者爲六十一元半至六十二元、升五角、古Ｂ嘜七十五元七十五元五角、小五角、DY嘜七十二元、HX嘜七十一元三角至七十一元七角、H嘜赤六十二元、荷棉白TML嘜七十四元五角、KD嘜七十三元三角、荷赤六十三元六角六十四元、最後至六十四元三角、九月六日日單者爲六十二元五角、又昨日香港來糖五千三百二十包、</p>
<h3>五金　單連鐵實銷動</h3>
<p>市上流通之九十磅單連馬口鐵交易、昨日來頗告興奮、因某機關有所採辦、兼之本街同行小五金號點綴亦夥、廠家雖無甚搜羅、然市况已呈相當熱鬧、所以同業心思復　、行市又見堅昂、每箱一百二十元與一百二十五元，均有開出耳、</p>
<h3>閘北貨　大式桂圓　到稀報漲</h3>
<p>大式桂圓因到貨無繼、市存軋缺、而新貨尙需時日、故有斷檔之虞、近市又漲四十元、中式亦帶好十元、小式較平云、</p>

<h3>蒙蔽</h3>
<p>嘗與人論小人之伎倆，惟「蒙蔽」二字，隨地可施，正不必事之大小也。昔有旂人守某州水鄉，魚鼇不値多錢，某紳延太守宴，有醉鮮蝦一器，食而甘之，歸命庖人如法治具，於是每日必一進。一日見某紳曰：「曩爾言不費甚錢，乃庖人日開銷二百文何也？」紳笑而不答。前年有人上慶興樓者，樓皆治北人肴品，某日，有京中客命治糖醋拌蘿葡，對主人曰：「此余京師向嗜之南菜，殊爽脆可口！」主人以爲時而效之，每上此樓，必點此品，而館中人開帳固一錢二分，大錢八十四也。食者固不以爲貴，可見市人伎倆，有北人而南菜者，卽南物而北價矣。常有貴公子席祖父之蔭，紈袴半生，一出人間，莫不奉爲奇貨，多方媚悅之，卽多方盤算之，人以一錢得者，彼必十錢。此等蒙蔽之習，言之可笑，然以爲小事也，乃充其類，而天下無事不有「蒙蔽」二字，匪惟小人，稱大人者亦如之，不特食品，國家貴重之物，珍異之需，關繫至大者，亦不外乎此。</p>

<p>家庭</p>
<h3>妻</h3>
<p>— 吳劍芬</p>
<p>華盛頓·歐文（Washington　Irving)在一篇題爲「妻」的小說裏，描叙一個女人竭盡心力去撫慰她的那敗於投機事業的灰頹的丈夫：「用盡了她的活潑的權力與柔和的媚態去贏回他的快樂！」使到男人感戴涕零，自謂一生中從沒經騐過這樣美妙的幸福的時光·歐文以爲：再沒有比這個更激動人的了。並且下結論說：</p>
<p>「一個結過婚的人遭遇坎坷，較之單身漢，更易於恢復他在世界上的地位。半因爲他的可愛的人需要和他一道生活，會策勵他努力；但最主要的，還是因爲他的精神有了家庭溫煦的安慰和補救；而且自尊心也很活躍，覺得外面雖是黑暗和屈服，但却還有個小小的愛的世界在家庭之中·……反之，單身漢是最易於自暴自棄的；總想孤獨和放縱，他的心很易於淪爲廢墟。像一所荒凉的房子，就因爲缺乏一個住戶。</p>
<p>這個判斷是對的：歷史上不少豪俠志士，當其落魄瀕於絕境時，就都靠了異性的力量把他們復活起來；女人是繞指柔，却正也是百煉鋼，由於她們的扶待，往往造成了男人們的堅强的性格，與夫百折不撓的精神。試看人們在未婚的靑年時代類都落落無奇節，但一入中年以迄老年，他的事業却燦爛地燃燒着，這該也是受了異性的愛所鼓舞的吧？我不禁想起高爾基的話來了：」倘若沒有愛，你爲甚麼要活在世上呢！」</p>
<p>詩人彌爾敦（Milton）曾經謳唱過「結婚所發出的芬芳的氣息，紫羅蘭花畦都沒有那樣甜密，」一個作爲扶助和溫撫的妻是可寳貴的，有妻的人究是幸福的。五六年前，當我讀到高爾基的「回憶安特烈夫」，我便這樣感覺到了，我直至現在還竊羨着這位憂鬱的作家有那樣一位夫人：她能作一個熱烈的情人，又能用母愛及看護的態度去對待安特烈夫；並且她很深刻地理解他的天賦的意義，以及他的心情中的痛苦的波動。她「不斷地使盡她全部力量，犧牲了她整個的個性，爲着她的丈夫。」這在未婚的靑年人看來，正不知要怎樣大喊「標準妻子」呢！然而我在「竊羨」之餘，却又不免代這位「序拉夫人」婉惜：爲了丈夫，爲甚麼女人就該連自己的個性也犧牲了呢？我想。</p>
<p>在法國作家巴越浪（Edozzard　Pailleron）的「討厭的社會」一劇裏，借「沙龍」爲「敲門磚」的保羅賴孟對他的妻子霞痕說：「我進來時是知縣，出去時該是知府才好，一切的關係都在你·」據說法國的社會上品評一個男人，往往以他的妻子爲標準，因此保羅能吾超擢？就完全看在他的妻子的身上了。但中國的社會却就兩樣，妻以夫之榮爲榮，以夫之辱爲辱，女人犧牲整個的個性來服待男人，已是年代悠邈了。這是女人莫大的恥辱！能和男人共甘苦，相諒解，互勉勵，這固是女人所需要的。但如果至於犧牲整個的個性，結局便等於百依百從的馴羊，生生世世，女人就只好、永遠做男人的附屬品了；嚴格地說，卽是男人的奴隸。正如蘇聯名詩人湼克拉梭夫爲了帝俄時代的卑賤的農村婦女而咆哮的那樣：</p>
<p>「臨死進棺材，還是一個奴隸！」</p>

<h3>舞后的歸宿</h3>
<p>— 程小青著</p>
<p>第六章　危險的經歷</p>
<p>倪金壽的驚人的答話，卻祇換得這少年的一陣冷笑。他向倪金壽又盯了一眼，又開始靜默了。倪金壽倒反而有些窘熊。因爲這一陣冷笑，的確也出於我的意外。倪金壽低頭頓了一頓，忽從衣袋中摸出那本記事冊來。</p>
<p>他一壁翻着那記事冊，一壁說道：「你可是以爲我憑空寃枉你嗎？你聽着，我姑且舉幾個證據給你聽：你和王麗蘭的關係已有相當時間，常趁着陸健笙不在的當兒，在伊家裏過夜——伊家裏是在靑蒲路二十七號。」</p>
<p>倪金壽的目光從他的記事簿上移到余廿棠臉上，余甘棠的視綫却再沒有勇氣和他接觸，祇低沉到他自己的皮鞋尖上。這時我也注視到他的皮鞋。那鞋是黃色紋皮的，鞋頭是尖形的，和我剛才在屍屋中所鈎摹的那兩個男皮鞋的印跡，似乎不同。因爲那兩個印，尺寸雖各不同，却都是圓形式的。</p>
<p>倪金壽繼續瞧着記事冊，說：「最近，王麗蘭又有一個新相好趟伯雄。這種浪漫女子棄舊戀新，原不足爲奇。你卻認眞起來，便開始恨伊。在十一日那天，你和這趙伯雄碰了面，彼此就衝突起來。那時王麗蘭袒護着伊的新歡，公開地排斥你。你因此便越發恨伊，引起了謀殺的心。這就是你殺人的動機。</p>
<p>這少年已不再像先前那麼安靜了。他雖依舊默默地低着頭，但我瞧得、他的面頰上巳沒有一絲血色。</p>
<p>倪金壽又說道：「這可是寃枉你嗎？……好，你再聽：你在十六黃昏，曾到伊家裏去，向那老媽子偷偷地查問伊和趙伯雄的行動。你在十七日晚上，你又曾到亞東旅館七樓七七四號去調查，知道王麗蘭在上一夜曾在那裏過夜——這七七四號，就時那趙伯雄的住所。」</p>
<p>余甘棠的神情更不安了。他在咬着自己的嘴唇，他的頭好像重得厲害，再也撐不起來。這神熊給予倪金壽一種興奮，他繼續申說這少年的罪狀。</p>

<h3>猛虎</h3>
<p>— 秀碧</p>
<p>我夢見自己在森林裏，執着一柄劍，像一個勇士。</p>
<p>一隻猛虎站在我的前面，吼羞。</p>
<p>我憤怒地舉起劍，我喊着：</p>
<p>「我要斬戮你這殘忍的野獸，你這凶惡的魔鬼。』</p>
<p>『哈哈！殘忍，』老虎吼着回答：我沒有人類殘忍。）</p>
<p>「胡說！」我揮了揮我的劍。</p>
<p>『我殺弱者只爲了飢餓，却並不爲了建立自己的英名，我並不用文字來裝飾這裝戳的罪行，我也並不要別人歌頌我的殺戳。」</p>
<p>『胡說。』我的聲音較前軟弱得多了。</p>
<p>還有，我殺弱者只用我的牙和爪，却並不借助於鐵和火藥，火和機器，我殺弱者只用我自己的體力，却並不用什麽機詐和陰謀……還有，我吼一聲只不過殺傷一條性命，而你們人呢？有些人，吼一聲却要……」</p>
<p>沒有聽完牠的話，我終於垂下我的劍，低下我的頭了。</p>
<p>「人！你能說什麼呢？」猛虎議笑着說。</p>
<p>我說不出什麼，我一直沉默到夢醒的時候。</p>
<p>隨筆</p>
<h3>窗下的默想</h3>
<p>— 明芒</p>
<p>明藍的似是無底的長空，　窗外窺進來，這飛滿了夕陽的光輝，跳動着燦爛之音樂的高空啊，使我沒落在渴望之默想裏，雖然，牠却是那麽一個方塊。</p>
<p>然而，金立在窗下，我神往地望着牠，忽然，金覺得這方藍天，漸漸的擴展開起來了；展開了，向着四圍。像是那泛起的大海，無際而深遠；緊接着在這藍色的海下面的，正是那可愛的金色的原野，夏日的陽光，灑下來，閃耀地飛舞着。麥浪滾滾的前進，翻越過這無限的闊野；這是祖國的豐盛的土地啊。</p>
<p>山林，深而黑，高大，繁茂；山背，無數匹的突起，堅實而粗壯，這是大地的一股生命的蠻勁所激起的嗎？一匹速一匹，交接地橫呈，深藍的太空，是分外的顯着鮮艷欲滴。</p>
<p>我想，我默默地想，我從朋友的來信中，知道關於那些祖國的天野的使人興奮的消息，我沉落在幻想裏了，我幻想那些使人興奮的生活和消息啊！那些使人尊敬的朋友的堅强的意志與信仰。</p>
<p>「自由的重要，遠勝過我們底生命！」</p>
<p>朋友的信上這樣說，對着這窗外的一方藍天，我重覆地默讀着，我想着這句話對於他們的意義。</p>
<p>可是，在這狹的籠中，我只是加重了我的渴望，懷念，對那海洋般的藍天，無垠的原野，和洶湧的深黑的山林，以及那些使人興奮的伙伴和使人興奮的日子……</p>
<p>我渴望自由之國土，我無法可以抑止。</p>
<p>醫學</p>
<h3>頭痛與智慧</h3>
<p>— 華志</p>
<p>智識階級人士，常常患着一種週期性的頭痛病或氣喘症，通常認爲這是不健康的象微。但據醫學上最新的理論，認爲這兩種症候，都是智慧症，純由生理演成，醫藥罔效。</p>
<p>這是根據美國奧克霍姆城大學敎授倍爾葉博士，最近向墨西哥醫學會發表的，他道：一有些人的頭痛，實在是超級智慧過度的微象，因爲他們具有非常繁複性的神經系統，這些神經系統經過極度的發展結果，便會刺激到心理方面，從而轉爲偏頭痛和氣喘的病象。</p>
<p>「至於婦女們患有此種症候的，是否也把智慧症目之呢？這個問題，頗有硏究的價値，不過有些女子確乎比男子來得機警，這也許是高級智慧發展的結果。」</p>
<p>「要之，凡富有動力的人，無論男女，都易患頭痛氣喘；這在醫學上鮮有療治的方法，有之，唯有休息兩字而已」</p>
<h3>流血</h3>
<p>— 柳嘉淦</p>
<p>要流血的時候不怕流血。</p>
<p>不需要流血的時候要極力避免流血。</p>
<p>流血應該有代價，因爲在身體上沒有比血更寳貴的東西了。</p>
<p>記住：血是紅的，不應該讓它「白流！」</p>

<h3>曹禺論我國話劇的出路</h3>
<p>— 容尙</p>
<p>自從「正在想」在上海演出後，輿論界中，好評嘖嘖，曹禺在戲劇界中的聲望和地位，無疑是日益增高了。記得在廿六年的時候，他曾在中央大學文藝研究會公開演講「中國話劇應走的路綫」這個題目，當時頗多精闢的論見。這裏特摘錄其中重要的幾段於下，使我們有一個重溫這位前進劇作家的箴言的機會。想來對當今生氣蓬勃的上海話劇界該亦不無小補的吧！</p>
<p>「從各方面看，我國話劇的確有很使人滿意的進步，然而總還不能算十全十美，目前的成績離理想的目標還遠得很！</p>
<p>「第一：我國話劇雖說漸漸接近現實，但不深刻，僅是表面的接近，而不是眞正的打動；能把部份的社會問題搬上舞台，却沒有把整個的現實社會生活聯繫起來。</p>
<p>「第二：我國話劇不能普遍，話劇不是娛樂品，試問在此年頭，能出一元六毛錢到戲院看戲的能有多少呢？一般眞正的看戲的人都沒有辦法走進戲院，這樣下去，中國的話劇運動是很危險的。不能普遍化，就是不能大衆化。</p>
<p>「第三：中國話劇還不够成爲眞正中國的，用花來作譬，一切文學藝術都與花一樣，花離了土不能生長，中國花應有中國的土氣。但是中國話劇大都沒有中國底土氣，具體說，中國話劇還太抽象化，觀念化，不能和中國現在的眞正環境，現實生活聯繫起來。</p>
<p>「第四：是技巧上的問題，現在中國的話劇還沒有完全把西洋技巧學習過來，加以運用是事實，無論什麼，學了不像樣，如吃東西一樣，沒有將它消化。</p>
<p>「關于這幾點，雖已有人注意，但往往犯了公式化，理想化的毛病。他們祇知道用說敎的言詞來打動人，而不知用感情來打動人，其結果僅給人一個公式。此點須加改良。至於普遍化更難做到了，眞正的藝術要和現實社會融合起來，過去的話劇僅能表現社會一部份的生活，倘把整個中國現代社會融合在話劇中間，那末牠底內容當然會更充實起來。」</p>

<p>好萊塢各公司攝製的影片，不論是喜劇，悲劇，宮　片，武俠片，艷情片，文藝片，以及神怪片，都有接吻的鏡頭，這是影迷們所共見的。但是接吻的方式各有不同，據好萊塢某影評人統計，不外下面的十種方式：</p>
<p>（一）甜吻　雙方對立距離在二呎以上，互相將上體前傾而吻的謂之甜吻。</p>
<p>（二）熱吻　相互擁抱而緊吻的謂之熱吻。</p>
<p>（三）膩吻　一吻而再吻，連續在二次以上者謂之膩吻。</p>

<p>（六）觸吻　雙方之間有物相隔，但是仍可接吻者，謂之觸吻。（此種接吻在監牢的畫面上用的最多。）</p>
<p>（七）稚吻　想吻而不吻，退退縮縮而結果仍舊接吻者謂之稚吻。</p>

<p>（九）耳後吻　雙方相互擁抱時，互吻各人後頸，謂之耳後吻。</p>
<p>（十）鼻尖吻　以鼻尖互相接觸，謂之鼻尖吻，卽我國所謂量鼻子是也。</p>

<h3>Regarding the Latest Situation in Vietnam: Foreign Minister Wang Issues a Statement, Firmly Expressing Determination to Defend Ourselves. If Japanese Armed Forces Land in Vietnam, China Will Immediately Dispatch Troops Across the Border. Ambassador to Japan Will Attend Meeting in Chongqing</h3>
<p>Chongqing: Recent rumors suggest that Japan will send a large number of troops to land in Vietnam and take military action. Foreign Minister Wang issued a statement today, firmly expressing China's determination to defend itself. The statement roughly stated that while China is resisting aggression, it originally had no intention of sending troops into foreign countries unless Japanese troops used foreign territory to attack China. Therefore, the Chinese troops stationed near the Vietnamese border would remain in Chinese territory as long as Japanese troops did not enter Vietnam, preventing them from crossing the Vietnamese border. However, reliable information has now been received that Japan is determined to send troops to land in Vietnam and take other military actions within Vietnam to attack Chinese territory. The Chinese government hereby solemnly declares that if Japanese armed forces invade Vietnam, regardless of the pretext used or the circumstances, the Chinese government will consider this a direct and imminent threat to the security of Chinese territory and will immediately dispatch armed forces to enter Vietnam to take self-defense measures to deal with the situation. The Chinese government will not be responsible for any consequences arising from taking such necessary measures. If the French authorities in Vietnam permit or tolerate any Japanese military action, the French government cannot avoid responsibility for all consequences arising therefrom, including all physical and property losses suffered by Chinese expatriates in Vietnam. (28th dispatch)</p>
<p>Vichy: Gu Weijun, the Chinese ambassador to France, recently issued a formal statement denying the rumors that Chinese troops had crossed the Vietnamese border. At the same time, Ambassador Gu issued a warning, declaring that if Japanese troops use Vietnam as a base, China will be forced to enter Vietnamese territory for defensive purposes. In denying that Chinese troops had crossed the Vietnamese border, Gu stated that this news may have been a misunderstanding caused by Chinese soldiers getting lost in Yunnan Province. Gu emphasized that the Chinese government has repeatedly reiterated to France its guarantee to respect the Vietnamese border, and that Chinese troops will never enter the Vietnamese border unless Japanese troops land in Vietnam. (28th United Press dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing: The "National Gazette" recently stated that Germany will not allow Japan to obtain "windfall gains" in Vietnam. The conflict of interest between Germany and Japan in Vietnam has caused Tokyo's southward policy to suffer its first diplomatic setback. "In the eyes of the German people, the status of Vietnam can only be decided at the negotiating table for German-French peace talks, and only Germany has the right to resolve Vietnam's fate. This is the reason why Germany does not allow Japan to profit." (28th United Press dispatch)</p>
<p>Tokyo: The Japanese "Yomiuri Shimbun" reported this morning that the ambassadors of the Soviet Union, the United States, France, and Britain stationed in China plan to hold a meeting in early September. Japan must carefully resolve its southward political issues to avoid its new order in the Far East becoming a dream. The newspaper also stated that the Standard Oil Company has sent several representatives to the Dutch East Indies to monitor the negotiations of the Japanese delegation in Batavia. The challenge of the United States to Japan is a competition for oil in the Dutch East Indies, with the aim of expanding its economic blockade of Japan. (28th Haitong News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>Hong Kong: A British ship that sailed to Haiphong on Sunday was ordered to return to Hong Kong at 1:30 p.m. yesterday. According to passengers, the ship is now sailing to Shanghai.

<p>London: Regarding the rumors that the British side has refused to issue export permits for ships sailing to Vietnam, Reuters reporters recently learned from the responsible parties that British ports have not refused to issue such permits. Although the Commander-in-Chief of the East Indies Fleet has the right to refuse to issue such permits within his jurisdiction, London has not received confirmation that he has done so. (28th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Hong Kong: It is rumored that two British ships traveling between Hong Kong and Vietnam have been recalled. There is no official announcement yet, presumably because of setbacks in the shipping arrangements between the Hong Kong and Vietnamese authorities. (28th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Tokyo: A spokesman for the Foreign Ministry claimed today that talks on the Vietnam issue in Hanoi and Tokyo are proceeding smoothly. (28th Reuters dispatch)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Competition Between Britain and Italy</h3>
<p>Today's European war is evidently being conducted on two separate theaters, the North Sea and the Middle East, with Britain and Germany and Britain and Italy as the main belligerents, respectively. In terms of content, both are struggles for hegemony between Britain and the Axis powers, but their forms of operation and development trends are quite different. The Middle East is much more complex than the North Sea. Recently, between Britain and Germany, there have been massive air raids for mutual destruction and revenge, as well as long-delayed blitzkriegs, but there is nothing else worthy of attention. In the Middle East and the Mediterranean, the Somaliland war has just ended, and tensions are rising again between Italian Libya and Egypt. The Italian-Greek dispute has not yet been definitively resolved, and Spain's participation in the war is also imminent. Complex and intricate, it is dizzying. If it is said that the scope of the Northern European war has narrowed and concentrated since Germany launched its offensive on the Western Front, then the situation in the Middle East has been continuing to spread and expand since Italy entered the war.</p>
<p>The totalitarian state's internal rule and prestige are tied to its achievements in external adventurous expansion, especially in resource-poor Italy. For many years, Italy's imperial ambitions have developed in three directions: Eastern Europe, North Africa, and the Western Mediterranean, with the aim of monopolizing the Mediterranean as its most pressing demand. But in terms of its achievements, Italy's efforts in Eastern Europe have been frustrated by the merger of Germany and Austria and the expansion of Nazi power into the Danube region. In North Africa and the Iberian Peninsula, even though it has staked its national strength, it has still only achieved partial gains, far from the dream of restoring the territory of the ancient Roman Empire. Therefore, Italy's participation in the European war this time is by no means simply to cooperate with Germany's needs, but mainly to complete its expansionist ambitions. In this regard, there is undoubtedly a tacit understanding between Germany and Italy, and Germany inevitably has to let Italy develop in the Mediterranean and Northeast Africa as the price for Italy's participation in the war and withdrawal from Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>These two Axis countries are currently fighting side by side and have repeatedly vowed that their alliance will last forever. At this point, it is not necessary to assert that there is some kind of contradiction between the two. But Germany is focusing all its efforts on defeating Britain as its only current goal and does not want to create additional complications to divert its strength. Italy, on the other hand, attaches more importance to gaining hegemony in the Mediterranean and North Africa. From the Red Sea coast to the African hinterland to Gibraltar and Tangier, all are objects of Italy's desire, and its targets may not be limited to Britain and its possessions without extending to other countries. In this regard, there is a kind of psychological and even strategic difference between Germany and Italy beyond tacit understanding, which cannot be eliminated by simply emphasizing their consistent steps. After France's acceptance of the terms of surrender, Germany has not made any negative comments about Pétain, while Italy frequently accuses France of breaking its promises and reveals its resentment towards France. For example, in the recent Italian-Greek dispute, Italian public opinion is extremely tense, while Germany's attitude is quite cautious, obviously unwilling to see the war expand to the Balkans and affect the attitude of Turkey and the Soviet Union. Although Italian-Greek relations have been tense to the extreme in recent days, they have still remained in the tense stage and have occasionally eased slightly. In short, the fact that war has not yet broken out is probably the result of Germany's intervention. Another example is the armed conflict between Romania and Hungary that was reported yesterday, which is also something that Germany does not want to see. If possible, Germany will definitely try to prevent its expansion.</p>
<p>However, in any case, if Britain is unable to use overwhelming force to force Italy to adopt a defensive posture, the trend of the war in the Mediterranean and the Near East will inevitably continue to expand. Even if the turmoil in the Aegean and Adriatic Seas suddenly passes, it will inevitably turn to Egypt or the Arabian Peninsula. In order to connect its East African possessions with its mainland, Italy will not hesitate to prepare to break through the British blockade of the Suez Canal and the waterways at a great cost. In order to protect its oil sources in the Near East and the gateway between the Mediterranean waterways and the Indian Ocean, Britain will inevitably gather all its strength in the Near East and the Mediterranean to deal with the situation. The task in this regard is mainly undertaken by Italy alone. Comparing the strength of the two sides, Britain is on one side while Italy is on all sides. The three services of the sea, land, and air see each other's strengths and weaknesses, and it is difficult to measure their sum. Italy has already achieved a preliminary victory in Somaliland, but its final gains and losses will still depend on the advances and retreats of both sides in Aden, Egypt, and Gibraltar. This battle will determine who the hegemony of the Mediterranean belongs to and can also determine half of the fate of the British Empire.</p>

<h3>Japanese Prime Minister Announces No One-Party System, New Political System Preparatory Committee Convened Yesterday, to Plan a Permanent Institution</h3>
<p>Tokyo: Prime Minister Konoe's statement on the new national political system is said to be released this afternoon. (28th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Tokyo: Prime Minister Konoe delivered a speech this afternoon at the opening meeting of the preparatory committee for drafting the new political system, saying that the concept of one-party rule contradicts the basic principles of Japan's national policy of "ruling all the people" and asked the committee to plan an institution so that all people can assist the Emperor, because it is Japan's permanent and final law. Konoe stressed that there is an urgent need to build a new political system in all aspects of national and people's lives (such as politics, economy, education, and culture), but this new political system cannot allow the adoption of a one-party system, because no matter how well this system works in other countries, it cannot be accepted in Japan because it violates the basic principles of Japan's national policy of "ruling all the people." The meaning of this new political system is a permanent organization that encompasses the entire country, so that all classes of people in Japan can fulfill their responsibility to assist the Emperor. Assisting the Emperor is the privilege of his people, and this privilege cannot be monopolized by the power of one person or one party. If opinions differ on the assistance provided, the final decision will be made by the Emperor. Once the Emperor makes a decision, all people must unite and obey his orders. This is the true essence of Japanese policy. The government is now making its best efforts to achieve this goal, and the convocation of the preparatory committee is based on this intention. He specifically requested the cooperation of the committee. The purpose of the new political system is to unite the total efforts of the country and the people, so that our 100 million people become a living whole and can all fulfill their responsibilities as Japanese subjects.

<h3>Conflict on the Soviet-Romanian, Hungarian-Romanian Border - Balkan Powder Keg Ready to Explode - Axis Powers Convene Meeting in Vienna - Invite Hungary and Romania to Participate to Eliminate War Crisis</h3>
<p>The fierce clashes between Soviet and Romanian troops on the border, as well as the engagement of Romanian and Hungarian aircraft over Hungary, have made war in the Balkans unavoidable. Political circles here are quite fearful that the Soviet Union will immediately invade Romania. As for the tense situation between Hungary and Romania, it is believed that because it is approaching its peak, it may also lead to conflict. The Soviet-Romanian border conflict occurred yesterday. According to the Soviet side, 500 Romanian soldiers have died. Although the actual battle situation is not considered excessively serious, observers here say that because the Soviet Union may launch a formal offensive against this small country immediately, any further firing should not be taken lightly. The Romanian-Hungarian air battle took place over Debrecen, Hungary, which is 20 miles from the Romanian border and 114 miles east of Budapest. According to Hungarian reports, the pilot of a Romanian fighter attacked a Hungarian heavy bomber. The Hungarian pilot was injured and forced to land. (International Dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>London - According to German radio news, the foreign ministers of Germany, Italy, Romania, and Hungary are scheduled to meet in Vienna tomorrow to discuss matters of common interest. It is generally believed that the convening of this meeting was initiated by Hitler after the Hungarian-Romanian negotiations broke down. The meeting is generally seen as a new move by the Axis powers to prevent an explosion in the Balkans. The news of conflicts on the Romanian border indicates that tensions between Romania and its neighbors have increased. It is reported that a total of 50 people were injured or killed in the Soviet-Romanian clashes, and one Soviet and one Romanian aircraft were shot down at the new Soviet-Romanian border. In addition, a Romanian fighter plane caused an accident on the Romanian-Hungarian border. According to a "New York Times" dispatch from Budapest, the foreign ministers of Hungary and Romania have been summoned to Vienna to resolve the Balkan crisis before the Soviet Union takes further action. At the same time, the Greek government is more optimistic about avoiding conflict with Italy. Independent observers believe that Hitler has exerted a moderating influence on Mussolini.

<p>Fierce Soviet-Romanian Border Conflict - Rumored Casualties on Both Sides Reach Hundreds</p>
<p>Bucharest - The situation in the Balkans became tense again yesterday, as there were widespread rumors here of clashes between Romanian troops and Soviet and Hungarian border patrols. According to unconfirmed reports, Soviet and Romanian troops clashed yesterday on the border of Dorohoi County in Bukovina. The Propaganda Department refused to confirm or deny this news. Another report stated that 100 soldiers died yesterday and six Romanian aircraft were shot down. Another report stated that 70 people died and one Romanian aircraft was missing. Government officials admitted yesterday that conflicts, including clashes between ground forces and aircraft on the Soviet-Romanian border, had occurred simultaneously along Romania's eastern and western borders in the past few days. They stated that Romania is willing to seek peace. It is reported that Romania has not lodged a formal protest with the Soviet Union or Hungary. According to demobilized Romanian soldiers returning from the north, there have been large-scale Soviet military movements every night along the new Bessarabian border for a week, and Soviet troops are stationed from Bessarabia to the border. It has recently been rumored here that Germany has recently greatly increased its troop presence in the East, and that Romania has withdrawn some of its troops from the northern Bessarabian province to show goodwill. (United Press Dispatch, 28th)</p>

<p>Cairo - Yesterday was the fourth anniversary of the signing of the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty. The British Ambassador to Egypt delivered a broadcast speech, stating that what we hope from Egypt is to faithfully fulfill its treaty obligations. We are now determined to sincerely protect our allies. With Egypt's cooperation, we will surely achieve victory. We all believe that Egypt has recognized that its interests in the war are the same as Britain's. We all know that we are now fighting against oppression and evil. This has given us an unyielding determination to continue resisting the demons that disrupt the world. We will not hesitate to sacrifice until we destroy them and lay the foundation for a new order. An Egyptian named Afifi also delivered a broadcast, stating that if Britain were not here, Egypt would have been invaded at the same time as Abyssinia or Tripoli. Britain is now fighting for the freedom and peace of all small countries. If Britain wins, the world will see the light of day again. (Reuters Dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>Hungarian Aircraft Attacked - Hungary - Romania Openly Provoking</p>
<p>Budapest - The Hungarian semi-official Telegraph Agency last night issued a message stating that a Romanian aircraft took "war action" against Hungary yesterday. It is claimed that Romania has completed the deployment of troops from Dobruja to the Hungarian border. It seems that Romania believes that the time has come to openly take war action against Hungary. According to reports from the military authorities in Debrecen, eastern Hungary, a Romanian fighter plane marked He112 attacked a Hungarian plane over a certain station there at 10:00 a.m. today. The Hungarian plane landed at the Debrecen airfield, and the Romanian plane flew east after violating Hungarian territory. (Reuters Dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>Budapest - It is rumored that another conflict occurred in the border area of Lázodonya near Mako, but this has not been officially confirmed. Government officials acknowledge that Romanian and Hungarian patrols exchanged gunfire there. An unconfirmed non-official report states that Romanian border guards fired at Hungarian soldiers. A team of Hungarian soldiers quickly arrived and drove the Romanian troops back. (United Press Dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>Italian Anti-Greek Propaganda Still Not Halted - Soviet Union's Position Pivotal</p>
<p>London - A Reuters diplomatic correspondent states that Italian newspaper and radio anti-Greek propaganda has not diminished to date, but the situation has not significantly deteriorated. There are currently no new signs that Italy intends to destroy Balkan peace itself or use Albania as a tool to attack Greece. Although Italy may test the effectiveness of Britain's guarantee to Greece, the possibility of using Albanian troops to achieve its goals cannot be ignored. However, this development may not be entirely beneficial to Italy, so it is still very doubtful whether Italy is willing to truly go to extremes. There is reason to believe that the Germans are not entirely in agreement with Mussolini's approach to Greek Prime Minister Metaxas. If Italy can obtain strategic Greek areas such as Crete as naval and air bases without war, it would be a victory. However, Greece has not shown any signs of yielding to Italy or succumbing to Italian intimidation. Italian newspapers have repeatedly threatened Greece with the possibility of disputes arising on the northeastern Greek border, and have stated that the Bulgarian government has now convened reservists. However, it has been heard that the British government has received assurances that the Italian newspapers' statements are completely unfounded and that the Bulgarian government sincerely declares that it does not intend to take any anti-Greek action. The success of the negotiations between Romania and Bulgaria regarding Southern Dobruja is the most encouraging result of the policy of revising borders by peaceful means, which is the firm aim of the Bulgarian government when engaging in negotiations. The Soviet Union currently adopts a position of non-interference in these various issues, but if the Balkans continue to be disturbed, the Soviet Union's position will be extremely important. There is no doubt about this. (Reuters Dispatch, 28th)</p>

The Hungarian side claims that there are currently 16,000 Romanians in Hungary, and the number may increase to 30,000 after the ceded areas are returned. (Haitong Telegraph, 28th)</p>
<h3>German Air Force Retaliates - Sixteen British Cities Bombed - London Area Under Frequent Air Raid Alerts All Night Long - Incendiary Bombs Dropped, Fires Erupt in Many Places</h3>
<p>London - Yesterday, German invasion aircraft flew over the British coast and attacked at least 20 cities and towns, but the dense anti-aircraft fire network in central London drove back the German aircraft. London was attacked twice last night, with only half an hour between attacks. Countless incendiary bombs fell on the London area, and fires broke out in several places, which were extinguished. (United Press Dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>London - Last night, large formations of German aircraft conducted the most extensive night raid on London since the start of the war. A German acoustic aircraft has been continuously bombing the London area for two nights. It is reported that German bombers and fighters flew over three cities in Wales, two cities in southeastern England, five cities in southwestern England, and six cities in the Midlands. The scope of the German air raids was extremely wide. In addition to London, 16 other British cities were attacked. This move was clearly a retaliation for the British Air Force's daytime air raids on 27 airfields in Germany, France, Belgium, and the Netherlands. Millions of London residents once again rushed into shelters upon hearing the air raid alarm. The general public was able to calmly obey air defense regulations. An International News Service reporter was in central London at the time and witnessed flashes of fire followed by loud explosions, indicating that the Germans were dropping bombs fiercely. Latest reports indicate that although the scope of the German night raid was wider than last night, the total losses were still less. The all-clear was sounded in London at 11:55 p.m. (8:55 a.m. Shanghai time). (International News Service Dispatch, 28th)</p>
<h3>Fierce Air Battle Over the Thames Estuary This Morning</h3>
<p>London - This morning, German aircraft flew to the British coast again, but suffered losses after being intercepted by British fighters. According to responsible sources, a formation of German aircraft flew south over the Kent coast, and soon after, another large group of German aircraft flew over the northern Kent coast. Both of these formations were flying inland, but were intercepted by British fighters and a fierce battle took place in the sky between central Kent and the Thames Estuary. The German formations were driven back and suffered losses, but the details are still unknown. It is said that the air battle lasted for about half an hour. When German aircraft appeared over northeastern Britain this morning, a passenger train was strafed by German aircraft, and the roof of the train was hit by bullets, but fortunately no passengers were injured. This afternoon, 24 German bombers attacked a city on the southeastern coast, dropping several bombs and destroying several buildings, but only one person was injured in the arm by the bombing. According to an Air Ministry communiqué issued this afternoon, the activities of German aircraft this morning were almost entirely limited to attempting to penetrate British defenses in the Thames Estuary and Kent, but the German aircraft were intercepted and driven back by British aircraft. It is reported that six German aircraft were shot down by British fighters in air battles. (Reuters Dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>Berlin - German aircraft bombed airfields in the Thames Estuary this morning, destroying many aircraft and engaging in fierce battles with British aircraft. A total of eight British aircraft were shot down, and three German aircraft were shot down. (Haitong Telegraph, 28th)</p>
<h3>British Aircraft Bomb German, Dutch, French, and Belgian Territories - 27 Airfields Bombed</h3>
<p>London - The Air Ministry stated that on August 26, the British Air Force dispatched bombers to attack enemy airfields by day, and expanded the scope of these attacks at night. 17 airfields in Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, and occupied France were bombed. A British bomber shot down an enemy aircraft returning from British territory over Nivelles airfield while flying back from Germany. In addition to attacking targets in Italy, British bomber formations used their main force to heavily bomb the artificial oil plant in Lützkendorf west of Leipzig, Germany; the oil storage depot and aircraft factory in Frankfurt; and the explosives factory in the suburbs. Targets in Cologne and military supply depots in Hamm were also attacked. British aircraft were active throughout the night, and all but one returned safely. One aircraft was also missing from the daytime raids. Further details released by the Air Ministry's Information Office stated that one of the main targets attacked in Germany, the dye factory in Lützkendorf, was heavily damaged in a bombing raid on August 16. This factory is one of the largest chemical plants in the world. During the British aircraft's last attack, the first batch failed to find the target due to clouds and smoke obscuring the view, but the British aircraft that arrived later found the factory and bombed it. One aircraft dropped several bombs directly on the target, and it was seen that at least two bombs hit the main building. Four minutes later, another British aircraft dropped bombs, and blue light was seen to be emitted. Fires broke out throughout the attacked area. Another British aircraft continued to drop bombs on the main building, hitting it and causing a loud explosion. The attack lasted for two hours, but the details of the results could not be seen clearly due to intense anti-aircraft fire and low-lying clouds. The British aircraft's attack on the oil refinery in Frankfurt was also very successful, dropping 50 high-explosive bombs and over 400 incendiary bombs. Fires were seen breaking out everywhere. The aircraft frame manufacturing plant in the area was also bombed, and six houses caught fire. (Reuters Dispatch, 28th)</p>

<h3>U.S. Clarifies Position to Japan - Determined to Protect Far East Interests - Rumored Secret Cooperation Agreement Between U.S. and Britain - Carlson and Others Request Aid to China</h3>
<p>Washington - According to the New York Times, the United States will insist on protecting American rights in the Far East. U.S. Ambassador to Japan Grew is constantly negotiating with Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka, and Admiral Hart is also handling negotiations with the Japanese authorities in Shanghai. These talks are not limited to the Shanghai issue, but also explain the United States' general position to the Japanese government. (Haitong News Agency Dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>Washington - Senator Holt, a Democrat from West Virginia, told the Senate yesterday that "it is widely believed that the United States has entered into a secret agreement with Britain" to cooperate jointly in the Far East. Senator Holt stated that although the government has not announced this matter to the country, "the administrative authorities know that this agreement actually exists." He also stated that after various details are revealed in the future, we will know that "this understanding established by the administrative authorities is more than any other mechanism." Senator Lundeen, a Farmer-Labor Party member from Minnesota, also criticized the impropriety of this action by the United States and warned that if the United States forms an agreement with Britain in Asia, there is a risk of dragging the U.S. into the whirlpool of war. He declared, "If Japan goes to war with our country, the war will not be held in the Hawaiian Islands or near San Francisco. The war will be on the Sea of Japan, at which time we must extend our lines of communication to 5,000 or 7,000 miles." The remarks of Senators Holt and Lundeen temporarily halted the ongoing debate on the conscription bill. (United Press Dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>Manila - Retired U.S. Marine Corps Major Carlson and British-New Zealander writer and war correspondent Bertrand last night both stated that the United States should adopt a firm stance in the Far East and urged that China be given all necessary assistance for the war. In succession, they delivered speeches, saying that "they are currently witnessing the possibility of a repeat of the Munich incident in the Far East, and they deeply condemn this move." Major Carlson stated, "If we adopt a policy of appeasement in the Far East, 'we will be marching towards Waterloo,' not merely repeating 'Munich.' The consequences of adopting a policy of appeasement will be that our prestige, our reputation for fairness, and our courage to firmly implement what we believe to be correct will all be lost." Bertrand stated that if the United States does not announce its definite policy, there is a possibility of direct cooperation between Britain and Japan. He believes that Britain's attitude towards the Far East is currently influenced by the European war, the unrest in India, and the evolution of its relationship with the Far East and its Pacific colonies. These speeches were initiated by the Philippine-China Industrial Cooperation Association, and were followed by a public question and answer session. Bertrand contrasted the United States' firm Far East policy with Britain's "wavering" policy. He called for the two countries to join hands in the East as soon as possible. Bertrand also contrasted New Zealand's attitude towards Japan with that of its mother country (Britain). He pointed out that New Zealand, in cooperation with Australia, was the first country to embargo war materials to Japan. Regarding the Australian fantasy that Japan and the Soviet Union could go to war, he said, "A war between Japan and the Soviet Union, as foreign writers and famous journalists Duranty have said, is most welcome to the world. The entire world would enthusiastically applaud, hoping that both sides would suffer defeat." Major Carlson stated, "If we can adopt a firm stance in the Far East and give China all the assistance it needs for the war, I believe that we can bring both the army and navy factions in Japan, who are vying for power, into line, and allow all peace-loving and secure people in Asia, including the Japanese, to be liberated."

<h3>Shigemitsu Discusses Desire for Anglo-Japanese Understanding</h3>
<p>London (Reuters Diplomatic Correspondent) - Foreign and Japanese newspapers have offered various interpretations of the Japanese government's recall of 40 diplomats to Tokyo. However, the following remarks by Shigemitsu Mamoru, the Japanese Ambassador to Britain, may be regarded as a responsible Japanese critique of Foreign Minister Matsuoka's surprising decision. Shigemitsu said, "I wish to clarify that the recall of the heads of diplomatic missions does not imply any change in the Japanese diplomatic policy recently decided upon by the Prime Minister and Foreign Minister. My mission in London to seek genuine Anglo-Japanese understanding has the full support of the Japanese government. The Japanese government and I personally earnestly desire to place Anglo-Japanese relations on a solid foundation." (Reuters, 28th)</p>
<h3>Honda Advocates Tough Stance Toward the US</h3>
<p>Tokyo - Honda, the former Japanese Ambassador to Germany, published an article in "Nichinichi Shimbun" today, advocating a tough stance toward the US. He argued that only in this way could the US be induced to change its policy of restricting trade with Japan. Honda proposed that Japan should take countermeasures against the US to harm its commercial interests, such as declaring a blockade of the entire Chinese coast under belligerent status, which would prevent the US from obtaining tungsten ore from China. At the same time, Japan should cut off the US trade routes in the South Sea and Southeast Asia, making it impossible for the US to obtain rubber and tin. The Japanese government should also formally inform the US that "We can cut off your major trade routes." (Haitong News Agency, 28th)</p>

<p>US Senators Express Opinions on Conscription Bill</p>
<p>Washington - Senator Johnson, a Democrat from Colorado, expressed his opinion in the Senate yesterday during the debate on the Burke-Wadsworth Conscription Bill. He said that if the bill were passed, it would inevitably lead the US into a military dictatorship. Johnson believed that the conscription bill was the most radical means of detaching the US from its inherent traditions and the first step in creating a military state. Johnson also said that conscription not only does no good for national defense but also damages strong modern national defense. Senator Tydings, a Democrat from Maryland, also opposed the conscription bill, but said that it was better to have conscription in advance and not use it than not to have it at all. Tydings also replied to Senator Taft, a Republican from Ohio, saying that Taft's claim that a sufficient number of volunteers could be obtained without conscription was theoretically naive. (United Press, 28th)</p>
<h3>McNary Delivers Speech</h3>
<p>Salem, Oregon - McNary, the Republican candidate for US Vice President, delivered a formal speech last night accepting the Republican nomination, denouncing the policy of appeasement toward European dictatorships and advocating self-strengthening for the US. He said, "Maintaining peace in the Western Hemisphere is the most urgent task. The aggressive European absolutists have exceeded George III of Britain and Napoleon I of France in previous history." He also said, "This is by no means an ordinary election. The wars beyond the two oceans, the Atlantic and the Pacific, and the peace in the Western Hemisphere that we urgently desire to maintain, have surrounded our political direction and forced us to decide with great effort. Domestic politics and foreign relations are both of great importance in the current situation. We have been lingering in the face of the tide for more than seven years. We have been extremely negligent in defense, both spiritually and materially. The great capabilities of the US have been hindered, and some people have lost faith in the future of our country and the work of the 'source of happiness.' No party is strictly responsible for these facts. Our minority party may not pay attention to this, but this responsibility belongs to the powerful party. This election is not merely a competition between two rival parties but a competition on political philosophy, in other words, a competition on the philosophy of government action. Whether the US will continue to move forward on its historical mission or retreat to a useless position, this is the question we are choosing at this time." (United Press, 28th)</p>

<h3>Defense Zone Issue Temporarily Subsides; US Insists on Fair Method; No Japanese Takeover of Central Zone Allowed; Merchant Corps Patrol in Rotation, No Security Concerns</h3>
<p>In the middle of this month, the commanders of the defense forces of various countries decided that the Ding District would be taken over by the Japanese army and the Yi District would be taken over by the US army. However, the Japanese side insisted on taking over the entire British army defense zone and has so far refused to move in. The above two defense zones are temporarily defended by the First Team of the International Merchant Corps and the White Russian Team to maintain order. However, this measure is only temporary, and the future depends on the outcome of the diplomatic negotiations between the US and Japan. According to sources, the analysis of the defense zone issue between the US and Japan is currently still in progress in Washington and Tokyo. Although it is difficult to know the progress, it is quite clear that the Japanese side is determined to take over the entire British army defense zone. According to general observation, the US side may not make further concessions and will insist on a fair distribution method. If the Yi District is also taken over by the Japanese side, the situation in the concession and the interests of Britain and the United States will be worrying.</p>
<p>Current Situation in Ding District</p>
<p>Since the British army withdrew, the defense of the Ding District has been temporarily taken over by the White Russian Team of the International Merchant Corps. The reporter went to the area for inspection yesterday and saw that the British army barracks on Great Western Road are now stationed by fifty to sixty members of the White Russian Regiment, assisted by a large number of Chinese and Western patrolmen. However, because the number of people is still very different from the previous British army stationed there, there is a sense of emptiness in terms of defense. When the British army was stationed in the area, high sand castles were built at Yidingpan Road, Yu Garden Road, Great Western Road, the end of Yidingpan Road, the end of Bailinan Road, and Anhe Temple Road for defense. Now, most of these sand castles have been demolished for unknown reasons, and a small part has collapsed to the side, with sand and gravel all over the ground. Although the Japanese side refuses to take over the Ding District, the Japanese forces have gradually penetrated. The gambling den in the Great Western Road Concert Palace has now been changed to the headquarters of the Japanese Military Police, with four Japanese soldiers stationed there. At the intersections of Yu Garden Road, Yidingpan Road, and Great Western Road and Yidingpan Road, where concession patrolmen and "police" used to stand guard to direct traffic, now only "police" are standing guard.</p>
<p>No New Developments</p>
<p>The spokesman of the Japanese Embassy stated at the press conference yesterday that he had not yet received a formal report from Tokyo regarding the news released by the Alliance News Agency that the issue of re-distributing the defense zones of the Shanghai Public Concession would be resolved locally, so he could not confirm it. The news released by the Alliance News Agency stated that the spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Tokyo stated at a press conference with Western reporters that the defense zone issue was purely a local issue and should be resolved locally. When the reporter asked the embassy spokesman here whether there were any negotiations in progress in Shanghai, he replied that he would not answer this question for the time being and would answer it in the near future. The US Navy Fourth Marine Regiment authorities did not make any statement on this matter yesterday.</p>
<p>Merchant Corps Garrisoning is of Great Importance</p>
<p>The North-China Daily News stated that the Public Concession "Yi" Defense Zone was recently taken over temporarily by the International Merchant Corps due to the withdrawal of the British army. It is found that the members of the Merchant Corps are merchants in this city, and some of them work in foreign merchant firms, especially those in smaller firms. If they want to leave their jobs to defend the "Yi" District, their bosses are unwilling to give them the necessary convenience, and they consider the departure of the Merchant Corps members to be an unfair burden on them.</p>
<p>Regarding this matter, Fei Lipu, the Director-General and Chairman of the Public Works Bureau, stated yesterday (the 27th) that the duties currently performed by the Merchant Corps in the "Yi" Defense Zone are of great importance. The Public Works Bureau is very clear that it is not appropriate to ask the Merchant Corps to engage in any work that is unnecessary for the public interest. It is hoped that all bosses will cooperate with the Public Works Bureau so that their employees who join the Merchant Corps can easily leave their jobs to carry out defense duties. According to the recent meeting of the Defense Army Command Committee,</p>
<p>Decision Plan</p>
<p>The "Yi" Defense Zone will be handed over to the US Navy Fourth Marine Regiment. The Japanese representative objected. At that time, it was generally believed that the Japanese authorities would ask the committee to reconvene to discuss the counter-proposals put forward by the Japanese side. However, it was learned yesterday that the Japanese side had not yet requested the defense army commander to hold another meeting. Also, the Shanghai Times stated that the A Battalion of the International Merchant Corps has been garrisoning the "Yi" District for a week. Last night at 8 o'clock, it was replaced by the Merchant Corps Cavalry Team and Armored Vehicle Team. In less than a week, or it will be transferred by the A Battalion.</p>
<h3>Police Liaison to Curb Violence; Two Concessions and Japanese Side Form Police Liaison Committee</h3>
<p>The English-language "China Press" reported that the Shanghai Consular Body sent a letter to Ke Zaiwei, Director-General of the Public Works Bureau, on August 12, stating the resolution passed by the Consular Body regarding the issue of terrorist activities in Shanghai. Ke Zaiwei convened a meeting in the meeting room of the Public Works Bureau yesterday (the 27th). Japanese Consul Miura and Chuanshao'an, and Morelet, the police chief of the French Concession (representing Consul General Ogen, who is away from Shanghai), were present.</p>
<p>Meeting Decision</p>
<p>The meeting started at 3 pm and decided that the police authorities of the four parties would organize a liaison committee to concentrate their efforts and cooperate to suppress terrorist activities in Shanghai. In the proposed liaison committee,</p>
<p>Number of Meetings</p>
<p>Will meet at least twice a month to discuss the steps taken by the police separately and decide on what joint plans. According to sources, if all parties cooperate in implementing the plan, it will greatly improve the prevention of violence.</p>
<h3>Church Hospital Bombed; US Will Protest; Waiting for Guilin Report</h3>
<p>Regarding the bombing of the hospital established by the American Baptist Church in Guilin by Japanese aircraft, Smith, the secretary of the General Association here, said yesterday that the reports received here about this matter were not very detailed. Therefore, the General Association sent a telegram to the hospital in Guilin the day before yesterday to inquire about the detailed truth, but has not received a reply as of yesterday. He said that after receiving a detailed telegram report, he will ask the US Consulate General here to protest to the Japanese side.</p>
<h3>Redemption of British Gold Notes to End at Midnight Today; Deadline for National Government's Negotiation to Extend Two Days Expires; Limited Number of Notes in This City, No Impact</h3>
<p>In order to prevent British pound notes from being seized by Germans and transferred to neutral countries to obtain foreign exchange in London, Britain decided to ban the import of British notes. However, in order to take into account the interests of note holders in neutral countries, a considerable period was given so that neutral countries could collect the British notes and send them to Britain. In Shanghai, from August 22, it was originally scheduled to end at midnight on the 27th. As a result of the National Government's negotiation, it was decided to extend the period for two days, which expires at midnight today.</p>
<p>Notes Stored in This City</p>
<p>British notes have been decreasing since the outbreak of the European War. Most collectors have already sold them, so the impact on this city is limited. The overseas circulation of British notes is the largest in northern France. When the German and French forces clashed, the British army went to France to provide assistance, and the army's salaries were paid in British pounds. According to the Anglo-French wartime currency agreement, British pounds could circulate freely in France. Now that northern France has fallen, the British government has banned the return of British notes in order to prevent large amounts of British pounds from falling into the hands of the German army. The world's oldest free currency has also been restricted due to the changing situation. Those who hoard foreign currencies in the isolated island should be alerted. It is heard that after the redemption period expires, there may be a way to obtain proof of reconciliation for British notes in Shanghai and Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Bank of China</p>
<p>Shanghai Branch and British banks such as HSBC, McCallum, and Chartered Bank have learned that the above banks have decided to extend the redemption of British notes for two days, until August 29. Starting from the morning of the 30th, they will no longer redeem them. The redemption of the Bank of China is converted at the statutory price of the Ministry of Finance, which is 45 yuan, 7 jiao, and 1 fen based on yesterday's market price. Today's redemption price will be converted based on the exchange rate again. However, in order to take into account the interests of Chinese holders of British notes, all Chinese holders of British notes can apply for exchange for legal tender and are not restricted. However, British banks only limit the exchange to their respective customers.</p>
<p>Money Exchange Guild</p>
<p>It was originally scheduled to stop buying and selling British gold notes yesterday, but because the bank redemption was extended for two days, it was decided to continue to buy and sell today and tomorrow. Starting from the 30th, it is planned to no longer buy and sell. Yesterday's buying price for British gold notes was 93 yuan of national currency per pound, but small notes of half a pound and one pound were further lowered by 10 to 20 cents. Because there were no buyers, there was no selling price. As for British gold pounds, because they are gold pounds and not notes, the market price is still listed as usual, and money exchange dealers still handle the buying and selling. Since yesterday, it has been heard that some small money shops have refused to accept British notes.</p>
<h3>Saigon and Haiphong Shipping Lines; Shanghai Shipping Has Stopped; Vietnam Situation Gradually Tense; Guangzhou Bay Also Suspended</h3>
<p>Recently, the situation in Vietnam has become increasingly tense, and rumors have been rampant. In order to prevent it, the Vietnamese authorities have reportedly automatically blockaded coastal ports such as Haiphong and Saigon. Whether it will be implemented is still uncertain. It is heard that the Hong Kong-Vietnam shipping line has been interrupted. The ships of Taikoo and Jardine companies that operate the Shanghai-Vietnam line have also been ordered by the Hong Kong line to stop sailing to Saigon and Haiphong.</p>
<p>Ports for Each Shipment</p>
<p>Therefore, the Jardine Matheson &amp; Co.'s "Mingsheng" wheel, which was originally scheduled to sail from Shanghai to Haiphong this afternoon, will only go to Hong Kong. The Taikoo Company's "Qingyuan" wheel, which was originally scheduled to sail to Haiphong tomorrow morning, has also been changed to Haikou. Guangzhou Bay has been suspended, and Xiamen and Hong Kong are still open. Jardine Matheson &amp; Co.'s "Taisheng" shipment is scheduled to go from Shanghai to Hong Kong on September 3. It is still scheduled to sail to Haiphong. Whether it can be completed depends on the situation at that time. The Taikoo Company's "Shandong" wheel sailed from Shanghai to Haiphong on the morning of the 25th, also stopping at Xiamen, Hong Kong, Haikou, and Guangzhou Bay. It is expected to arrive in Hong Kong tomorrow, and it has now been ordered to stop sailing to Guangzhou Bay and Haiphong. The shipment has very little cargo, only more than 20 pieces. When the time comes, it will be stored on the dock in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Vietnam Situation Gradually Tense</p>
<p>According to sources in the shipping industry, after hearing about the tense situation in Vietnam, various shipping companies telegraphed the Vietnamese side to inquire. All have received replies this morning, saying that the situation is not good and that the ships should sail slowly. However, according to the French Postal Company here, "The company has not yet received any telegrams from Haiphong regarding the situation. The French Postal Company's 'Xijiang' ship, which went directly to Haiphong on the 25th, is expected to arrive at its destination on the 30th. The company has not received any unexpected telegrams."</p>
<p>Scheduled Flights</p>
<p>Also, according to reporters from the Pingming News Agency who inquired at the local office of the British Royal Aviation Company, it is said that due to the current situation, the European-Asian airline schedule has been disordered. The schedule was originally two flights per week, flying from Hong Kong, transiting in Bangkok and Singapore, and then to Europe. However, due to the tense situation, the schedule is uncertain and very sparse. Therefore, people in this city who want to purchase tickets from the airline must contact the local office and then the office must telegraph Hong Kong again, which takes a long time. As for the Hong Kong-Vietnam airline, it is still operated by the French airline.</p>
<h3>Public Concession to Exchange Permits; Old Permits Invalid from October 1</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Public Concession Public Works Bureau issued a notice yesterday, stating, "The curfew permits issued by the police station when the Shanghai War broke out have been more than three years ago and have not been reissued, which has caused many problems. Therefore, the Public Works Bureau hereby announces that all curfew permits previously issued by the police station will be invalid from October 1 of this year, and new permits will be reissued. Each permit will cost two yuan of national currency, but it must be approved by the police station that there is a real need for a permit before it can be issued. To apply for a new permit, please obtain a blank application form from office number 310 of the police station at 185 Fuzhou Road."</p>
<h3>Feng Zhizhong Shot and Injured Yesterday; Two Bullets Hit His Buttocks, Condition Not Serious; Assailant Arrested, Shot in Vital Areas and Died; Stray Bullets Injured as Many as Five Pedestrians</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 1:20 PM, another assassination case occurred in the French Concession. The victim was Feng Zhizhong, secretary of the Sino-French Friendship Association. He was shot twice in the buttocks. The assailant fled on a bicycle after the incident but was intercepted by French Concession detectives on Avenue Edward VII. The detectives shot and wounded his arm on the spot. The following is an investigation report by our reporter:</p>
<p>Encountering an Ambush</p>
<p>Feng Zhizhong, a native of Guangdong, is 47 years old. He resides at No. 25, Lane 550 (Bubbling Well Road) of Avenue Albert in the French Concession. He once served as an editor for the Shanghai French-language newspaper and then resigned. He is currently the secretary of the Sino-French Friendship Association at No. 577 Route Lafayette, but the association only recognizes him as a member. Yesterday at 1:30 PM, Feng was riding a rickshaw home when, upon passing the front of No. 546 Avenue Albert, a man dressed in blue overalls on a bicycle suddenly caught up, drew a pistol, and shot at Feng. Feng, upon hearing the gunshot, abandoned the rickshaw and attempted to escape. The assailant pursued him, firing shots. Two bullets hit his buttocks, causing him to fall to the ground in extreme pain, with blood flowing profusely.</p>
<p>Police Pursuit</p>
<p>Upon hearing the gunshot, a policeman from post No. 195 nearby immediately drew his pistol and rushed to the scene. Seeing this, the assailant rode his bicycle eastward along Avenue Albert towards Avenue Foch. The policeman blew his whistle and pursued relentlessly, firing shots at him. The assailant returned fire. Upon reaching the entrance of the General Police Station at No. 47 Avenue Foch, some French detectives were having lunch inside. Hearing the whistle, they all drew their guns and came out to investigate. The assailant became even more flustered and fired his gun wildly.</p>
<p>Died from Gunshot Wounds</p>
<p>He hastily turned from Avenue Foch into Rue Pere Robert, and then attempted to escape towards Avenue Road. The detectives still pursued relentlessly. When the assailant tried to fire at the detectives again, he found that his bullets were all used up. When he reached the back gate of No. 2 Avenue Road, a French Concession police car No. 2626 happened to be passing by. Witnessing the situation, they drew their guns and opened fire, hitting him in the back, chest, arm, and other parts of his body. He fell off the bicycle, landing on a woman. He was holding a six-round revolver in his hand.</p>
<p>Stray Bullets Injure People</p>
<p>The woman was Shen Chen, 32 years old, a native of Ningbo, residing at No. 12 Avenue Road. Yesterday afternoon, she was taking her children out when she unfortunately encountered this accident. She suffered a slight head injury. Her son, Shen Wenlu, 13 years old, was injured in the left leg. Her daughter, Shen Yuexiu, 19 years old, was injured in the kidney area. Two other pedestrians were also injured: Yao Peizhen, 10 years old, a native of Jinshan, was injured in the leg by a stray bullet, and He Acai, 16 years old, a local, was injured in the left back by a stray bullet. The French Concession police called ambulances and sent Feng, the injured persons, and the assailant to Guangci Hospital for treatment. The assailant died from injuries to vital areas upon arrival at the hospital. Feng's injuries were not serious. He Acai among the pedestrians was seriously injured. The police are currently conducting a thorough investigation into the reasons for Feng's assassination.</p>
<p>Feng's Background</p>
<p>It is found that Feng once served as the principal of the Sino-French Drama School and later organized the Sino-French Drama Society, once performing the play "Poppy." Later, the school and the drama society dissolved de facto. Feng's wife is also from Guangdong.</p>
<h3>New Committee Established by the Municipal Council to Study Future Election Politics; Discussion on Whether to Change Election Procedures; Six People Including Allman Appointed as Committee Members</h3>
<p>The Municipal Council's announcement yesterday morning (the 28th) foreshadows that the procedures for electing directors in the future may be changed. The announcement stated that the Council has invited six taxpayers, including Allman, Fema-Gary, Gless, Mitchell, Sauveaire, and Yasui Gengo, to form a committee to study what changes should be made to the election procedures.</p>
<p>Current Regulations Not to be Modified</p>
<p>Yesterday, a spokesperson for the Municipal Council told a Western newspaper reporter that the newly established election committee will amend the existing election laws. It is said that the committee established yesterday will only study whether some details of the election procedures need to be changed in order to make next year's voting more convenient. The spokesperson also stated that this committee was organized by the Municipal Council on its own initiative and was not established at the request of Japanese residents in this port, as reported by "Lixinbao." Regarding the Japanese newspaper's claim that "the failure of this year's election of three additional Japanese directors was due to imperfections in some voting regulations, and the Municipal Council has agreed to amend these regulations," the spokesperson pointed out that the new committee has no power to amend the current voting law. He said that this law is part of the Shanghai Land Regulations, formulated by the signatory powers, and cannot be changed without the consent of these powers. As for when the committee will hold its first meeting and what points of the election procedure will be reviewed, the Municipal Council did not specify.</p>
<p>Internal City Public Officials Restricted from Entering the Concession</p>
<p>During the War of Resistance, public officials who went abroad, to the concession, or to the occupied cities under the pretext of official business were strictly restricted by the National Government in order to maintain their posts. It is learned that the Zhejiang Provincial Government, in view of the proximity to Shanghai and the areas occupied by the Japanese army, and that some public officials, without special assignments and without prior approval, still secretly went there under various pretexts, has reissued an order: hereafter, all public officials in the province, unless they have been approved by the provincial government and issued a certificate, are strictly prohibited from going there. The inspection agencies should conduct strict inspections. If any public official is found going to the above-mentioned areas without a certificate approved by the provincial government, they may be detained and reported for investigation.</p>
<h3>Municipal Council Deputy Secretary-General Gobbert Returns to England to Join the Army; Gobbert Has Achieved Considerable Merit in Five Years of Political Service; Loves Shanghai and Hopes to Return Someday</h3>
<p>Submitted Resignation, Will Leave Here in Mid-September</p>
<p>The English "Demei Evening News" reports that Gobbert, Deputy Secretary-General of the Municipal Council, has recently submitted his resignation and may leave Shanghai in mid-September to join the British Army. It is heard that Gobbert has been planning to join the army for some time, and he is expected to receive an officer's rank when he officially enlists. It is learned that Gobbert has served the Municipal Council for five years and has done his best in his duties.</p>
<p>Remarkable Achievements</p>
<p>At the beginning of 1938, during Philippe's long leave of absence, Gobbert served as acting secretary-general and president, presiding over the affairs of the secretary-general's office. At that time, the Shanghai war had just ended, and the situation in the city was complex, so it was particularly difficult to handle affairs. Recently, Gobbert has worked hard to improve the</p>
<p>City's Rice Situation</p>
<p>Although there were many obstacles due to the lack of rice from the inland being transported to Shanghai, Gobbert's efforts have achieved remarkable success. Gobbert is 32 years old, grew up in South Africa, and returned to England at the age of 18. He studied at Oxford University and obtained a law degree. After graduating, he specialized in economics. According to Gobbert's statement to reporters this morning, he is very</p>
<p>Fond of Shanghai</p>
<p>and cannot help but feel sad upon leaving. However, Gobbert smiled and declined to elaborate on his five years of experience serving the Municipal Council, only saying that he felt very happy in Shanghai and certainly hopes to return someday. Gobbert also said that he has a younger brother who lives in the United States and has become an American citizen, but he has recently gone to Canada to join the British Air Force. It is heard that Gobbert's successor has not yet been decided, but Nash, the Municipal Council's assistant secretary-general, has the highest hopes.</p>
<h3>French Chief Inspector Fabre Flies from Qingdao to Shanghai; Pullen Greatly Improved; Chief Inspector Conducting Thorough Investigation</h3>
<p>Fabre, the French Chief Inspector of the Shanghai French Concession Police, was originally on vacation in Qingdao. After receiving news that six rioters intended to harm Acting Chief Inspector Pullen, he flew from Qingdao and arrived in Shanghai at 5:00 PM on Tuesday (the 27th), only nine hours after Pullen was assassinated and injured. After arriving in Shanghai, Fabre immediately returned to work. It is reported that he will conduct a thorough investigation into the unprecedented attack on a senior police officer. As for Pullen's condition, he has greatly improved and may be discharged from the hospital this weekend. According to records, the assassination of French Concession police officers has occurred three times in the past month. The first was Russian detective Ivanov, followed by detective Yang Gaoski, both of whom have died. However, this attack on a senior police officer is the first in the city's history.</p>
<h3>No Vegetables Available at Old Zha Gate Market Yesterday; Goods from Pudong Intercepted, Vegetable Prices Soared by 100%</h3>
<p>The city's vegetables, in addition to some from the areas along the two railways, rely on supplies from Pudong, Zhenru, Longhua, and other places. However, since the establishment of the "Central Market" on Guangfu Road last winter, the Japanese side has also established a "Food Wholesale Market" in Hongkou, so that all kinds of vegetables (including eggs, game, and meat and vegetarian food) from Wenbei, Zhenru, Jiangwan, and Wusong are intercepted. Only Pudong and Longhua are still free to sell, but after being controlled by them, vegetable prices have soared by 50% due to heavy exploitation. This spring, the "Market" also established a "Branch Market" in western Shanghai, so currently only the Pudong route has no obstacles.</p>
<p>Pudong Goods Also Intercepted</p>
<p>Because the goods resold by the "Market" are more expensive than those sold directly by vendors, and most goods must be paid for and reserved early, small-scale stallholders are unwilling to purchase from them, and instead buy directly from vegetable farmers, rendering the "Market" nominal and incurring huge losses. Therefore, they have further established a "South City Branch Market" along Dongmen Road in Nanshi to intercept goods from the corner of Pudong.</p>
<p>Prices Doubled, Unprecedented</p>
<p>Due to the control and interception by the "Markets," vegetable farmers have no profit, leading to a sharp reduction in the goods arriving. All goods arriving in the port are completely controlled by the "Markets." The Old Zha Gate, originally a major base for the concentration of local goods, had no vegetables available yesterday, and prices soared by more than 100%. Green vegetables sold for nine yuan per dan (including the basket for weighing, and the basket is still taken back; originally sold for four or five yuan, and the basket was removed), lotus root sold for twelve yuan per hundred catties (originally sold for five or six yuan), and winter melon sold for four yuan and fifty cents (originally sold for two yuan and fifty cents). Therefore, the retail prices were: cabbage sold for three cents per catty, and other onions, chives, garlic, eggplants, and potatoes also increased by more than 100%, which is unprecedented.</p>
<h3>Japanese Warships off Zhenhai Port Bombarded Chuanshan and Shuangquan</h3>
<p>The Zhejiang Provincial Shanghai Association received the following telegram from eastern Zhejiang yesterday: (1) At 6:58 AM the day before yesterday, a Japanese warship coming from east of Chuanshan fired eight shells. At 7:33 AM, the warship sailed eastward, direction unknown. (2) A Japanese warship anchored in front of Hengshan Ocean has sailed towards Ting Shuimen at 7:50 AM yesterday morning. (3) At 8:35 AM, a Japanese warship anchored in the sea off Dong Qimen, Hengshan, suddenly fired more than ten shells at Shuangquan Port without targeting anything. The shells landed on barren sand dunes, so there was no damage. At 10:50 AM, the Japanese warship also sailed eastward and left. (4) At about 3:50 PM the day before yesterday afternoon, another Japanese warship sailed to the sea off Dong Qimen and anchored in the sea off Qi Jiao, without any movement. (5) At 1:45 PM the day before yesterday afternoon, a Japanese aircraft was discovered over Songmen, intruding into Hai Dou for a short time. The Ningbo air defense哨 sent out an air raid warning and then an emergency warning ten minutes later. Then, the Japanese aircraft passed over Ningbo and then left the sea from Guan Haiwei, Cixi, and the alarm was lifted at 2:27 PM.</p>

<h3>British Commander of the China Fleet, Layton, Goes to Hong Kong to Take Office, Accompanied by British Ambassador Sir Kerr; Says Royal Air Force is Brave and Courageous</h3>
<p>Sir Noble, Commander-in-Chief of the British Fleet in China, has been appointed Governor of Hong Kong by order of the government. His post as Commander-in-Chief will be temporarily replaced by Sir Layton. It is heard that Mr. and Mrs. Layton came to Shanghai via the United States and Japan and arrived in Shanghai on the evening of the 26th. They took the Changxing Company's Empress of Asia at 2:30 PM on the next day (the 27th) and went to Hong Kong with British Ambassador Sir Kerr to take over the matter. When passing through Shanghai, he told people that the hearts of the people of the British Isles were very calm and very excited about the German offensive. When he left England five weeks ago, although the German air blitz had not yet begun, he dared to assert that there were no words such as "panic" and "discouragement" in the British dictionary, because the British people knew that the expansion of their national combat power allowed them in the Royal Air Force, mostly the fresh forces of the British dominions, so their bravery and courage were commendable, and aircraft production had reached the required amount due to day and night processing, and the air force advantage will undoubtedly be ours in the future. Therefore, I hope that the British expatriates in Shanghai should not worry about the situation in the British mainland, because the people of the British mainland have not worried about their encounters and are confident that they can defeat Hitler.</p>

<h3>Huge Amount of Foreign Rice Transported to Shanghai; Vietnam Situation Tense, Rice Weevils Thinking of Moving Again</h3>
<p>Regarding the increasingly tense situation in Vietnam, the difficulty of shipping between Shanghai and Vietnam, and the many rumors in the market, general speculative merchants took the opportunity to become active, intending to raise the prices of long-stored goods for sale, in an attempt to obtain huge profits without labor. After the rice merchants' tea party market opened the day before yesterday, the people's hearts were temporarily strong, and speculative rice weevils were thinking of moving again. The market price was shouted up by more than one yuan, and the result was that the previous market was made seven or eight cents higher. However, the market prices of foreign rice in each grade have approached the highest assessed price. The authorities of the two concessions and the Shanghai Rice and Grain Evaluation Committee are paying close attention to the rumors currently spreading in the rice market, and it is learned that there is no danger of interruption in the source of foreign rice from abroad. If the shipping between Shanghai and Vietnam is stopped, rice from Siam can still be transported to the market. Moreover, when domestic early rice enters the market and the rice stacks are fully stocked, 3,000 tons (ie 300,000 bags) of rice that has been ordered and stored in Hong Kong has already been loaded on wheels and is on its way to Shanghai, and will arrive at the port within days to supply the market. Therefore, the recent upward trend in rice prices is truly beyond expectations.</p>
<h3>Hanner Ship Released, Arrived at Ao Jiang Kou; Not Freed of Restraints; Not Imported Yet</h3>
<p>Although the shipping between Shanghai and Zhejiang and Shanghai and Fujian is full of thorns, shipowners are still doing their best to dredge. According to a report by the Datong News Agency reporter, the German Far East Company's Hanner ship, after being monitored by Japanese warships in the sea off Haimen, reported to Shanghai by the shipowner yesterday morning that it had been released and has now sailed to Ao Jiang Kou, but has not been imported yet. Although the reason for not being able to import was not mentioned in the telegram, the public believes that it must not have been freed from the restraints of the Japanese warships. The Shanghai company is waiting for the news that the ship can be imported smoothly. It is unreasonable to add obstruction to Ao Jiang, which does not involve the scope of the blockade. As for the Songmen route, since Gao Deng's successful trial voyage, the Manili Maler wheel, which is represented by the Baochang Shipping Company, has been closed yesterday and will sail to Song Dou today. On the Shanghai-Minnan route, the Fuxing Company's Xin Anna wheel was also closed yesterday and will sail to Fuqing this morning.</p>
<h3>Thieves Rob Car on Huajin Lane</h3>
<p>At 10:05 AM yesterday morning, the Shanghai Commercial Savings Bank at No. 313 Fuzhou Road dispatched two employees, Zhu Shou Kang and Ma Xing Yuan, to carry 10,000 legal currency, divided into two packages, one package of 6,000 yuan and one package of 4,000 yuan, both wrapped in newspapers, to the Shanghai Commercial Savings Bank on Jiangxi Road. When the car was turning north at the intersection of Hankou Road and Shanxi Road on Huajin Lane, two bandits suddenly rushed out from the side of the road, both holding wooden fake pistols, and blocked the way. Then they jumped into the car and forcibly robbed the two employees of the two packages of cash, and then ran away. Afterwards, the two employees and the driver pursued closely and shouted for help. At that time, the nearby police heard the alarm and rushed over. As a result, one bandit was arrested, and a portion of the stolen goods, totaling 4,000 yuan, was seized from him. The other bandit escaped and was arrested into the police station and interrogated severely. According to the confession, another bandit was subsequently caught and detained for investigation.</p>
<h3>Yuan Renjie's Foster Son; Woman Takes Child and Flees; Woman Demands Huge Sum; Yuan Reports Arrest to Police; Said That Child is Born to Yuan and Woman</h3>
<p>Yuan Renjie, a local man living on Zhongshan Road in Zhabei, entrusted his six-year-old son Tianyun to Xu Zhang, a neighbor and fellow villager, for fostering during the Shanghai War, paying six yuan per month. In June of this year, Tianyun was taken back once. On the 5th of this month, Xu Zhang came to Yuan's place and took Tianyun away again. At 10:30 AM on the 26th, Zhang went to Yuan's house again and suddenly claimed that Tianyun had been raised by her for three years and that she should be given 500 yuan. They quarreled with each other and left. At 1:30 PM, she and her son Xu Genfa and another vagrant went to Yuan's house to demand money, making a lot of noise, saying that if they were not given money, they would harm Tianyun, and went away with a loud roar. Yuan Renjie reported the situation to the Putuo Road Police Station. After a Chinese and Western detective found that Zhang lived at No. 40 Yaojia Lane, Zhongshan Road, Zhabei, they rushed to cooperate with the "Police Station" under its jurisdiction to arrest her. Zhang had taken the Yuan child away by opportunity, and only her son Xu Genfa was taken back to the Police Station. Yesterday, he was sent to a special court. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin applied for custody. Questioning the defendant's confession, Tianyun was born to Yuan Renjie and his mother. Judge Jiang instructed to send them back to custody and reschedule the review.</p>
<h3>Child Trafficking Organization; Gang Leader Arrested; Sent Personnel to Xiamen to Detain and Bring to Shanghai; Also Seized Sixteen Children</h3>
<p>In recent years, the number of young boys and girls abducted in Shanghai is countless. The reason is that there is a large-scale secret child trafficking organization in Shanghai, which sells most of the abducted children to Xiamen. A few months ago, the Jiaxing Road Police Station cracked a part of this organization. Now, Xie Wanfang, the chief detective of the Public Concession Police Station, has arrested five key figures in the organization, Chen Zhang, Xia Zufu, Jiang Ruju, Xiang Zhaoliang, and Wang Tang, at the Zhisha Dannie steamer and other places, and seized six children, including Chen Longqing, Lin Jincai, Zhang Gensheng, Shen Runchun, Lu Genfa, and Juhong. Except for Chen and Lin, who have found their families, they have been sent to the Special First Court for interrogation and detention. The details have been reported in this newspaper. Now, the police have found that Zhang Gensheng is the son of Zhang Li at No. 3, Lane 189, Liaoyang Road, Shen Runchun is the son of Shen Dong at No. 34 Qunxianli, Zhoujiazui Road, and Lu Genfa is the son of Lu Zhang in the bungalow of Shihuibang, Huinan Road. However, Juhong was abducted from the countryside of Changshu, so her family cannot be found. During the rescheduled hearing of this case, the police found that the headquarters of this trafficking organization was located in Xiamen, so they sent personnel to Xiamen to cooperate with the local government to arrest the gang leader Su Desan and his accomplices Chen Jiabai, Chen Lin, and Zeng Wang, and seized sixteen children. Except for Su and the other four criminals who were escorted to Shanghai at 11:00 PM the night before, the remaining sixteen children are still on their way to Shanghai. Yesterday morning, Xiao Xiefei, the judge of the Criminal Court of the Xiao Xiefei, presided over the trial. The police lawyer Ru Bao-yi stated that since major criminals have been successively arrested in this case, it is urgent to investigate them in order to wipe out this evil group that separates families. Therefore, he requested that the criminals be temporarily detained and the hearing rescheduled, and that the children whose families have been found should be returned to their families first, so that families can be reunited as soon as possible. After Judge Xiao briefly questioned the criminals, he ruled that they would be detained and rescheduled for further questioning. Chen Longqing and the other five children who have been claimed by their families were allowed to be returned to their families first.</p>
<h3>Selling People; Woman Zhou Fengying Detained; Two Girls Sent to Jiliang Institute</h3>
<p>Zhou Fengying (44 years old), a Suzhou woman residing at No. 843 Tiantong Road, has recently been making a lot of profit by selling people. She has two adopted daughters, Zhao Fudi, 10 years old, and Jiang Fubao, 7 years old, both local. Zhao was abused and beaten by Zhou from time to time, with scars all over her body. Neighbors wrote a secret letter to the Huisi Police Station under its jurisdiction, and sent detectives to rush to the address at noon on the 27th, arresting Zhou and sending Zhao to Renji Hospital. The examination revealed severe injuries on her face, shoulders, back, arms, legs, buttocks, etc., and bite wounds, etc. She, Jiang, and Zhou's 20-year-old biological daughter, Lin, were taken to the Police Station together. Yesterday, he was sent to the Criminal Court No. 3 of the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin explained the case and asked for an extension for a detailed investigation. Zhao then stated that she had been to the defendant's house for five years, and if she was a little careless in her work, she would be brutally beaten, etc. Jiang said that she went to the defendant's house when she was three years old, calling her mother, and she did not know anything else. Questioning Zhou, her confession was vague. Judge Jiang Shuzi ordered them to be sent back to custody and rescheduled for further review. Zhao and Jiang were temporarily sent to the Jiliang Institute for foster care.</p>
<h3>Head Nurse Died Suddenly; Both Defendants Not Guilty</h3>
<p>In the case of Li Yuying, a Pingtan woman and head nurse of the Chinese and Western Sanatorium at No. 536 Bushi Road, who died suddenly, the prosecutor sued Lu Zhenqing, the director of the hospital, and Lin Zhengliang, the doctor, for the crime of forging documents, because they issued a certificate of death from madness and did not report to the autopsy as required. The defendants respectively hired Ling Changyan, Shan Yu-hua, and Zhu Hongru as three lawyers to defend them. The case was tried by Judge Zhu Chuzhe of the Special Second Court, and the trial was concluded.</p>
<p>Yesterday's sentencing, "The Main Text," Lu Zhenqing and Lin Zhengliang were not guilty, and the reasons for the judgment were stated in court, slightly adjusted, forming the criminal elements of this case, requiring evidence related to other people's criminal cases, and making false acts. In this case, the defendant Lin Zhengliang issued a death certificate for the purchase of a grave, not as evidence for other people's criminal cases, so there was no criminal act. The judgment is as above.</p>
<p>After this case occurred, the bizarre and complicated plot attracted a lot of attention from the society, and after the two defendants were prosecuted, the right and wrong were of great importance. Fortunately, lawyers such as Ling Changyan cited legal principles and engaged in defense, so they could be declared innocent.</p>
<h3>Yesterday Morning, Two Kidnappings Occurred: One Involving an Iron Business Owner, the Other a Yarn Merchant</h3>
<p>Upstairs at 59 Lane, Weihaiwei Road, Seymour Road, Yong Sheng Coal Company, was rented by Tang Jintai from Wuxi. Tang, along with his wife, Qin, and son, Yonggen, lived in the back building on the second floor. The front building was established as the Yuan Tai Iron Company, specializing in the sale of scrap iron and old copper for a living. Yesterday morning, around 8:10 AM, Tang had not yet gotten out of bed when suddenly four burly men, dressed in Pulis suits and Xiangyun gauze shirts and trousers, speaking in Shanghai accents, hired a car from the Yitai Motor Company, number 17701, and drove to the front of the Yong Sheng Coal Company. They stormed upstairs to Tang's bed, forcibly dragged him up, took out handcuffs, cuffed him, and dragged him into the car, speeding away. Afterwards, it was learned that one of the four men was from Ningbo, named Zhang Guifu, who was in the same business as Tang Jintai and had business dealings with him. Before leaving, he told Tang's wife not to panic and to go to the "Local Court" in Nanshi to settle the debt. Subsequently, Tang's wife told people that Zhang Guifu had mortgaged a large amount of iron material to Tang in Hongkou before the war, and the silver and goods had long been settled. This sudden kidnapping was clearly a deliberate attempt to extort money.</p>

<h3>Finance, The End of the Month is Approaching, Long Positions in Foreign Exchange Begin to Sell Off</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market situation, HSBC listed price, was unchanged. The market for British and American exchange rates was flat and then weakened again. This was because of a lack of stimulating news, and operators were slow to move. Most were watching with their arms folded, and a few speculators went in and out suddenly. Also, because the end of the month is approaching, long positions began to spit out and roll over to the next month, so recently the US exchange rate once hardened to 5 yuan and a half can be settled, and the British exchange rate also saw a return from tight to flat. HSBC also had plenty of supply intentions at 5 yuan and a half for the US exchange rate, but after that, because HSBC stopped supplying, buyers wanted to buy, and 5 yuan 46875 also felt difficult. Until near noon, speculators came out again to go in, and the potential weakened again. The closing was little changed. As a result, British gold was three pence six two five, and the US exchange rate was 5 yuan four six eight seven five, which was flat with the British exchange rate of the previous day, and the US exchange rate was loose zero six two five. The futures were also the same.</p>
<p>In and Out Not Lively</p>
<p>At the beginning of the morning, the London big strips rose by 115, reaching a rise of zero six two five. New York silver prices remained flat, London gold remained fixed, and the exchange rate of British to American did not move. The exchange rate of British to Shanghai was also flat, the exchange rate of US to British was a small percentage, the exchange rate of US to Shanghai was smaller, and there was no market for French exchange rates. The central listing of each exchange rate remained the same. The bank's morning opening spot selling price was British gold three pence six zero nine three seven five, and the US exchange rate was 5 yuan four zero six two five, which was slightly tighter than the previous day's closing price zero one five six two five, and the US exchange rate was flat. After the opening, Chinese speculators had a slight appetite, and the market was stable. It is estimated that the Chartered Bank sold US exchange rates of 5 yuan four zero six two five for August to Chinese merchants, and 5 yuan three seven five for September. HSBC's listing was announced and did not move, and the silver balance tax was announced to increase by 1.00%. After that, although American banks and others absorbed it, a part of the speculators suddenly came to sell, and HSBC at that time was willing to supply US exchange rates of 5 yuan and a half. It is estimated that Chinese speculators issued US exchange rates of 5 yuan four three seven five to 5 yuan and a half for August by Standard Chartered and Japanese banks. But after a while, HSBC stopped, so the US exchange rate of 5 yuan four six eight seven five was also difficult to settle. Later, Chinese speculators regained US exchange rates for September, as 5 yuan four three seven five. The closing result was British gold three pence six two five, and the US exchange rate was 5 yuan four six eight seven five. The September British gold was two pence six zero nine two seven five, and the US exchange rate was 5 yuan four three seven five, which was no honor or disgrace compared to the British exchange rate. The US exchange rate increased by zero six two five each.</p>
<p>Hong Kong Exchange Market Still Flat</p>
<p>Hong Kong, 18th (Wednesday) Electric, the exchange market opened flat this morning. There was no change in British exchange spot futures and Shanghai exchange spot. The US exchange spot was loose zero six two five, at 22 yuan five six five. The Japanese exchange spot increased by half a yuan, at 96 yuan. At 9:50 AM, the Shanghai exchange spot rose by 2 yuan, at 413 yuan. At 10:05 AM, it was stable. The US exchange spot tightened zero six two five, at 12 yuan and a half. The Shanghai exchange spot fell back by 2 yuan, still at 411 yuan. At 11:30 AM, it was stable. The US exchange spot loosened again zero six two five, at 22 yuan five six two five. The Shanghai exchange spot continued to fall by 1 yuan, at 410 yuan. The rest did not move. There was no market on Wednesday afternoon.</p>
<p>Tianjin British and American Both Tight</p>
<p>Tianjin, 28th (Wednesday) Electric, the exchange market opened flat this morning. British and American exchange spots each tightened zero nine three seven five, British exchange was three pence three two two five, and the US exchange was 5 yuan zero three one two five. The Shanghai exchange slightly decreased by two and a half Jiao, at 208 yuan and a half. The "United Notes" black market did not move, still standing at 92 yuan seven Jiao and a half.</p>
<h3>The Environment is Not Purely Bullish, The Gold Market's Rise Has Ended</h3>
<p>Although the enthusiasm for buying in the cash red black market yesterday was strong, the rising trend was still greatly hindered. Judging from the situation outside the market yesterday afternoon, the 5,900 yuan mark had already been exceeded. The market opened only at 5,880 yuan at the beginning of the morning, and because the exchange market reported hard, gold and silver companies and others sold out to the market. They still relied on the Hong Kong gang to secretly pull up, and a certain money exchange industry to cover shorts, to firmly guard above 5,850 yuan. But not long ago, the general bulls of the same day saw that the environment was not purely bullish, and their thoughts all turned, and those who tended to sell rose one after another. The securities gang bulls came out from time to time, and the silver companies also threw, and the lowest was 5,835 yuan. The noon closing was only 5,838 yuan, which was 8 yuan higher than the previous day. About 2,000 taels were traded in half a day, and the silver building ornaments did not change in the end. Customs gold, etc. remained flat.</p>
<p>Red Open is the Highest</p>
<p>Since the beginning of the morning, each tael (ten taels), the market was stable, first the money exchange industry entered 50 taels of gold number, at 5,880 yuan, which was 50 yuan better than the formal price before the holiday. Later, because the gold number gang tended to sell, although the Hong Kong gang was asking for absorption at this time, but because the exchange rate reported loose, floating more often closed, so the head felt that the supply was greater than the demand. Not long after, it tragically fell by 60 yuan. Silver companies entered 20 taels in the silver building industry, and the price dropped to 5,820 yuan. Then the selling wind subsided slightly, and a certain money exchange industry took advantage of the low to cover shorts, and the Hong Kong gang continued to secretly search for purchases, so it soon rose again to 5,875 yuan. Finally, another money exchange industry suddenly came to spit out, and the securities gang bulls frequently came out, and it dropped another 35 yuan. The silver numbers mutually did 20 taels, and it retreated to 5,840 yuan. Later, it relied on the gold number to pull up slightly, and it rose more than 10 yuan again. But not long after, the selling wind rose again, and the silver number gang stuffed out even more. But a certain money exchange industry still made small covers, and it fell to 5,835 yuan before the closing. However, the closing reported 5,838 yuan, which was 8 yuan higher than the noon closing on Monday of this week. The six-month yuan fluctuated, and the selling price of cash number's own brand gold was more than ten yuan higher than the red open, and the purchase was reduced by 30 yuan. The current standard gold is more than 50 yuan lower than the listed gold, and there is little activity.</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold Still Hangs at 600 Yuan</p>
<p>The exchange of gold jewelry from silver buildings per tael has not changed. Datonghang still hangs at 600 yuan, and the new exchange is similar to the above price, reducing the purchase by about 30 yuan.</p>
<h3>Last Day for Using British Pound Notes in Shanghai</h3>
<p>The British gold pound notes circulating in Shanghai can be largely divided into 10-pound, 5-pound, 1-pound, and 10-shilling (half-pound) notes. Banks and money shops refer to the 5-pound and 10-pound notes as large notes and the 1-pound and half-pound notes as small notes. The buying and selling prices vary. The prices published in the newspapers are for large notes. Small notes are worth half a yuan or one yuan less, and half-pound notes are even lower. British banks and the Bank of China do not differentiate. Therefore, those who want to sell their British pound notes should first inquire at British banks, such as HSBC and Mercantile Bank. After inquiring about the prices, they can then inquire at the small money shops on Sichuan Road and sell to whichever offers the highest price. However, it is important to distinguish between large and small notes. As far as I know, large notes can be sold to money shops, while small notes can only be sold to British banks. If note holders possess a large number of gold pound notes, they can have the British bank send them to London to be exchanged for British drafts at the Bank of England, which can then be remitted to Shanghai. The commission fee is 0.25%, plus insurance and the cost of remitting from England to Shanghai, which is more cost-effective than selling to various places. However, it takes two months to receive the money. Furthermore, those who do not have commercial relations with the bank cannot ask them to collect the money. (Bing)</p>
<h3>Gradual Increase in Japanese Currency</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw the apparent rise of Russian currency, although it was still lower than the over-the-counter price on the 26th. Consequently, British and American pounds also fell by five jiao each. There were still a few transactions involving British gold notes, and the market price rebounded by five jiao. American gold notes gradually declined, falling to 18.12 yuan in the evening market, a drop of 0.23 yuan compared to the pre-holiday (26th) price. Hong Kong notes were in high demand, and the market price soared. Annam, Robi, Philippine, and Australian gold notes were also in demand, and their market prices uniformly rose. The upward trend of Japanese gold notes did not subside, rising to 1.475 yuan in the evening market. The supply and demand for Korean notes remained balanced, and the evening market price remained at the original price of 1.085 yuan.</p>
<h3>Method for Distinguishing Woolen Cloth and Serge</h3>
<p>— Zhifeng</p>
<p>The value of woolen cloth and serge naturally depends on its weight, with heavier being more valuable and lighter being cheaper. Smooth and firm fabric made from well-spun wool is considered superior, while coarse and loose fabric made from raw wool is inferior. Overcoating wool is the opposite; lighter is superior and heavier is inferior. This is because overcoating wool becomes thicker, with more yarn making it heavy and stiff, while more wool makes it light and soft. For thin woolen cloth and serge, it is generally known that full wool fabric has no wrinkles after being tightly grasped and crumpled. Fabric with more wool and less yarn will also have fewer wrinkles. Fabric with less wool and more yarn will have heavy wrinkles. To determine the composition of yarn and wool, two threads should be pulled out horizontally and vertically and burned separately with a match. Wool has a foul odor, and the ashes shrink into a spherical shape. Yarn crackles, has no odor, and no shape. This is conclusive evidence. However, it is important to note that tweed often contains mixed colors, with one thread of wool and one thread of cotton yarn spun together. Therefore, when burning, it is necessary to first separate them by rubbing them between the thumb and forefinger before burning. Most woolen fabrics are woven in a "well" shape, with ordinary fabrics having ten threads of yarn and ten threads of wool, while better fabrics have ten threads of yarn and twenty threads of wool. Salesmen often pull out woolen threads and burn them for customers to see, but they do not pull out the yarn threads. Clever customers should carefully distinguish them to avoid being deceived. After the "August 13th" incident, most of the domestic woolen fabrics were mixed with rayon. Rayon is light, soft, and fluffy, appearing similar to wool at first glance. It is easy to be fooled if one relies solely on hand-feeling without burning.</p>
<p>To distinguish the front and back sides of fabrics such as serge, broadcloth, riding breeches cloth, and straight gabardine is easy because they all have diagonal patterns. Those who wear woolen serge clothing know that the left-sloping side is the front. For other types of patterned tweed, if there are diagonal patterns, the left-sloping side is also considered the front. Just remember the character "人" (person); one stroke being "丿" (left-falling stroke) is the correct side, and one stroke being "　" (right-falling stroke) is the reverse side. There is also an excellent method for distinguishing, regardless of the thickness of the fabric and regardless of day or night. Hold the fabric in your hand and bring it close to your eyes, about five or six inches away. Look carefully; the shiny side is the front, and the furry side is the back. If both sides of fabrics such as board cloth, hairline, and fulham have fur, then the fur on the front side will be short and stiff, while the fur on the reverse side will be long and flat without a doubt.</p>
<h3>Discount Rate Rises by One Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the discount rate for exchange drafts rose slightly, with the buying discount consistently at 37 yuan per thousand throughout the day and the selling discount at 39 yuan, an increase of one yuan. The interest rate for interbank lending remained unchanged, quoted at 0.16 yuan for both the morning and afternoon sessions.</p>
<h3>Securities and Bond Market Thriving</h3>
<p>After the holiday, the securities market suddenly turned bullish. The market was stable in the morning and extremely active in the afternoon, with prices climbing steadily without looking back, almost reaching the high prices of the 12th. Rumor has it that Hong Kong investors have a large demand, and the atmosphere has improved. The market is showing signs of prosperity again. In recent months, the market has seen a clear trend: whenever prices weaken, trading slows down; when prices rise, trading increases. This phenomenon suggests that there are often large investors buying in, while smaller investors are mostly selling. This is undeniable. Currently, without even considering the gradual improvement of the environment, judging from the market situation, the scarcity of chips and the excitement of investors suggest a promising future. Trading was very limited in the morning, with a turnover of only about 100,000 yuan. However, the underlying market trend was already improving. Lianyi and Tongxing were buying, while Yitai, Renchang, and Yichang were selling. In the afternoon, Lianyi and Xinfu continued to buy aggressively, making it very lively. No. 16 and Tiansheng Hengfu also showed strong interest. Although Tongkang, Hongkang, Lianhe, and other bulls were taking profits or selling, prices continued to rise gradually. Later, Dafeng and Shunchang sold, while Hongda, Dasheng, and Daxinchang again showed demand, and prices remained firm. As a result, prices uniformly rebounded by 0.45 yuan to 0.85 yuan, with a total turnover estimated at 800,000 to 900,000 yuan. The details are listed below.</p>
<p>Stock transactions: 45 shares of Zhonghua Book Company were traded at a price of 30.05 yuan per share.</p>
<p>According to a report from the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, the stock market opened with an uncertain trend yesterday, but gradually became firmer later in the day. The volatility on the day was significantly less than in the previous days, and trading was extremely active. At the close, buyers had an absolute advantage in both industrial and rubber stocks.</p>
<p>London, 27th (Tuesday): The market prices of Chinese foreign bonds and Far Eastern British company stocks today saw a slight improvement in British stocks. HSBC's London-registered shares rose by half a pound to 62.5 pounds. Hong Kong-registered shares remained unchanged. Gula-Klang rubber shares rose by three pence to 14 shillings, while the rest remained unchanged.</p>
<h3>Grain: Rice Difficult to Manipulate, Price Increase Fleeting</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the opening of the foreign rice market was still tight, with sellers unwilling to easily let go. Buyers, in addition to local shops continuing to purchase, also saw some activity from inland traders. In addition, speculators and small-scale hoarders were eager to trade, causing a surge. Both Saigon fired rice and twisted rice exceeded the quoted price by more than one yuan. However, with ample warehouse stocks, there was some concern that excessive manipulation would be difficult to manage. As a result, the market trend turned weak, with more selling than buying, and prices fell back. The closing prices returned to the original levels. No. 1 aged Saigon rice remained at 59.5 yuan, No. 2 at 56.2 yuan and 56 yuan, fired rice at 59.2 yuan and 59 yuan, small twisted pointed rice at 54.6 yuan and 54 yuan. Other varieties also followed suit. After all, due to the lack of support from actual sales, even the original packaged Yinghua Company No. 2 Saigon rice was once quoted at 63.5 yuan, and No. 2 was quoted at 65 yuan for transferred cargo, but no transactions were made due to the wait-and-see attitude of buyers. The trading volume of spot rice was only about 4,000 bags.</p>
<p>Yesterday, there was also a small shipment of foreign rice arriving in Shanghai, 606 bags of which were loaded from Hong Kong on the Taikoo Company's Jinan Wheel and arrived at the company's wharf on the Bund in the French Concession in the morning. (Zu)</p>
<p>Although the arrival of japonica and glutinous domestic rice was limited, it was rumored that the market inside and outside was similar to the supply and demand due to the price being expensive. Open Jinli special yuan remained at 62-63 yuan, Changdan white yuan around 61 yuan, Hong Kong special wu at 62.5 yuan and 62 yuan, Changbang fresh clear japonica at 68.5 yuan and 68 yuan, Changzhou Sukun japonica around 66 yuan, and secondary to 63 yuan, Nangang original packaged early rice at 64 yuan, the market saw 62.5 yuan, finally 61.5 yuan, etc.</p>
<p>The source of Zhoupu new japonica rice continued to be cut off, with only 6 dan reported to have been made, and the price remained at 63 yuan.</p>
<h3>Japanese Flour Spot Prices Fall, Futures Rise</h3>
<p>The flour market yesterday was quite ordinary for spot goods. Because foreign wheat and foreign flour have arrived in recent days, and the actual sales during this year's Mid-Autumn Festival mooncake season are far from comparable to the past, although the production of Chinese flour mills is limited, the sales volume is not very large. The total market turnover for Fuxin and Lao Che Pai flour was nearly 4,000 bags, and the mill price was still 15 yuan. As for the Japanese flour market, the spot price fell while the futures price rose. Phoenix brand spot goods were 14.55 yuan, a slight drop of 0.05 yuan, September was 14.8 yuan, and October required 15 yuan, with over 3,000 bags traded. Other inland flours and foreign flours, although they have arrived, have not opened for sale.</p>
<p>The wheat market yesterday was also lackluster. It was found that several thousand bags arrive at Hongkou and Zhabei every day, but they are all limited to delivery to Japanese mills, and the supply to Chinese mills remains difficult. Therefore, the purchase price of Chinese mills is still about 2 yuan higher than that of Japanese mills, and the total quantity is less than 1,000 bags. Japanese mills had good purchase volume, with about 3,000 bags delivered to the mills, and the price remained around 21 yuan.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Large Investors Take Profits, Cotton Yarn Plummets After Rising, Closing at a Low of 963 Yuan</h3>
<p>The yarn market, which was surging the day before yesterday, turned downward after opening higher yesterday. This was entirely due to the actions of speculators. After rising for several days, it had increased by more than 100 yuan compared to the low price. Given that the current environment is not very favorable, it is better to secure profits than to keep them in hand. Therefore, many bulls came out, and the market quickly declined. However, some investors were still optimistic, but inventories were increasing daily.</p>
<p>Spot yarn opened in the morning, continuing the enthusiasm from the previous day, and the bulls took the opportunity to raise prices, resulting in a sharp upward trend. 20-count Double Horse yarn opened at 990 yuan. However, some large investors were secretly selling, and the momentum was softening. It slightly fell to 985 yuan, but general speculators were still buying, and the bulls were still strong. Unexpectedly, profit-takers unanimously sold out, and the market fluctuated for a long time. As the chips loosened, the downward trend accelerated around 11 o'clock, breaking through several levels, from 980 yuan to 970 yuan, closing at a low price of 963 yuan. It was found that 2,345 bales were traded in half a day. The price of 20-count Double Horse yarn fell by 20 yuan. Today, 1,357 bales of cotton yarn were shipped to Hong Kong. The amount purchased by each port is as follows: same industry 1,400, Hong Kong 925, total 2,345.</p>
<h3>New Cotton Condition Very Good, 4,800 Bales of Indian Cotton Arrive</h3>
<p>The current cotton situation has become quiet again. Except for occasional demand from Japanese factories, the payment period is still one or two months later. At the same time, the upward trend in yarn prices is like a flash in the pan, fleeting. Therefore, the cotton market sentiment has been hit again. In addition, the condition of new cotton production is currently not bad. If there are no storms during the White Dew season, a good harvest can be expected. Therefore, the cotton market is expecting stable prices. There were very few transactions for spot cotton today, and the market trend was weak.</p>
<p>Foreign cotton market prices: The New York cotton market was very quiet, and as a result of mass selling and some bulls closing out, the closing prices fell by three to five pounds compared to the previous day. Indian cotton, including forecasts, fell by 2.5 robies.</p>
<p>Shanghai foreign cotton trading: Yesterday, due to the improvement in yarn prices, raw cotton trading became active again, but the volume was not large. Japanese manufacturers were more active in purchasing, while Chinese factories were quieter, because Chinese factories generally have more inventory than Japanese factories.</p>
<p>4,800 bales of Indian cotton arrived in Shanghai the night before last, shipped from Bombay on the British Company's Soudan Wheel. They arrived at the port at 8 pm the night before last (27th) and berthed at the Huashun Wharf in Hongkou for unloading.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Speculators Sell Off, Stock Prices Fall</h3>
<p>Domestic Cloth: As rumors gradually subsided, foreign exchange rates lengthened, and the Shanghai-Hankou Line's Hana Wheel was again hindered, the market atmosphere relaxed, and speculators continued to sell. However, the Guangdong and Hong Kong traders' appetite remained strong. The opening prices for various cloths were flat, and a part of the prices fell in the later market, 0.25 yuan to 0.5 yuan per piece. Traders from Guangdong and Hong Kong bought more than 200 pieces of coarse cloth and grey cloth, and nearly 300 pieces of coarse cloth, twill cloth and colored cloth. Traders from Zhejiang and Fujian bought nearly 100 pieces of colored cloth and coarse cloth. Traders from Yantai bought more than 100 pieces of coarse cloth and gabardine. Traders from Henan bought more than 3,000 pieces of colored cloth and colored twill.</p>
<p>Eastern Cloth: Due to sluggish actual sales and a decrease in the benchmark price, general speculators with long positions sold off slightly at a profit, and the market trend turned downward. 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth opened at 33.05 yuan in the morning, and fell by 1 yuan per piece to 32 yuan in the afternoon, and continued to fall by 0.25 yuan to 31.75 yuan at the closing. Four Gentlemen gabardine also fell by 0.02 yuan to 0.925 yuan per yard.</p>
<p>Exports: 407 pieces of cotton cloth were shipped to Hong Kong today.</p>
<h3>Oil Market: Edible Oil Trading Very Active, Price Up Another 2.5 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, trading in the oil market was very active. As production prices recovered, investors' confidence rose, and both raw soybean oil and processed soybean oil advanced, resulting in a sharp increase of 2.5-2.6 yuan compared to before the holiday. The leading trading category was futures. In addition to the local street, garden, and inland markets accounting for one-third of the spot market sales, the rest were speculative. A total of 80 pieces of Jiaozhou raw crude oil were traded at 64-65 yuan, and 100 pieces to be delivered in the first half of September were priced at 63.5 yuan. 350 pieces from the second half of September to the second half of October were priced at 62 yuan. 200 pieces of Yantai tallow to be delivered in September were priced at 64 yuan. 50 barrels of Qingdao raw crude oil were priced at 90-91 yuan. 1,000 barrels of land cargo were priced at 88.5 yuan to 90 yuan. The traded soybean oil included 50 pieces of Jiaozhou oil, with prices detailed in the market price section; 50 pieces of Qingqi oil, 50 pieces of Yanqi oil, 20 barrels of Jiangbei oil, 100 barrels of Dalian oil, 30 barrels of Rihua factory oil, and 200 dan of Dayou factory oil.</p>
<p>Yesterday, 1,100 cans of tung oil arrived from Tianjin.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Raw White Turns Expensive</h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market guild settlement prices: 24 raw white spot was 76.3 yuan, old goods was 75 yuan. Suddenly, a telegram came from the Netherlands, 3.19 US dollars C.I.F.I.C. example, so people's hearts easily rose by several jiao. New goods were 76.7 yuan to 77 yuan, up 0.5 yuan from the previous day. Old goods were 75.9 yuan, transit goods, that is, those with delivery orders, were 60.09 yuan and 61.2 yuan, up 0.7 yuan.

<h3>Hardware: Single-Coated Iron Has Active Sales</h3>
<p>The trading of 90-pound single-coated tinplate circulating on the market was quite exciting yesterday. Because a certain agency made some purchases, and the small hardware stores on this street also participated in large numbers, although manufacturers did not search much, the market was quite lively, so the industry's thoughts recovered, and the market price became firm and expensive. Prices of 120 yuan and 125 yuan per box were quoted.</p>
<h3>Zhabei Goods: Large-Sized Dried Longans – Supply Short, Prices Soar</h3>
<p>Due to the lack of incoming shipments of large-sized dried longans and the scarcity in the market, coupled with the time needed for new shipments, there is a concern of supply disruption. Recently, the market price has surged by forty yuan. Medium-sized longans have also seen a price increase of ten yuan, while small-sized longans remain relatively stable.</p>

<h3>Deception</h3>
<p>I once discussed with someone the tricks of petty people. The two words "deception" can be used anywhere, and it doesn't necessarily matter whether the matter is big or small. In the past, a Banner Man guarded a waterfront town in a certain prefecture. Fish and turtles were not worth much money. A certain gentleman invited the prefect to a banquet, and there was a dish of drunken fresh shrimp, which was delicious. Upon returning, he ordered the cook to prepare it in the same way, and from then on, it was served every day. One day, he said to the gentleman, "You said it wouldn't cost much money, but why does the cook spend 200 cash every day?" The gentleman smiled without answering. Several years ago, someone went to Qingxing Restaurant, which serves northern cuisine. One day, a guest from Beijing ordered sweet and sour radish salad and said to the owner, "This is a southern dish that I have always loved in Beijing. It is especially refreshing and delicious!" The owner thought it was fashionable and imitated it. Every time he went to this restaurant, he would order this dish, and the cost to the restaurant was only one coin and two cents, or eighty-four large coins. The diner didn't think it was expensive, which shows the tricks of the market people. There are northerners who cook southern dishes, which means selling southern goods at northern prices. Often, noble young masters inherit the privilege of their grandfathers and spend half their lives as playboys. When they enter society, everyone regards them as rare commodities, flattering and pleasing them in every way, which means calculating them in every way. What others get for one coin, they must pay ten coins for. These kinds of deceptive practices are laughable to talk about, but if they are considered trivial matters, then everything in the world will involve the two words "deception." It's not just petty people who do this; even those who call themselves great men do the same. It's not just food; important national items, rare and exotic needs, and matters of great importance are all subject to this.</p>

<h3>Wife</h3>
<p>— Wu Jianfen</p>
<p>Washington Irving, in a short story titled "Wife," describes a woman who tries her best to comfort her husband, who is despondent after failing in speculative ventures, "using all her vivacity and gentle charm to win back his happiness!" This makes the man feel grateful and tearful, saying that he has never experienced such wonderful happiness in his life. Irving believes that nothing is more moving than this and concludes:</p>
<p>"A married man who encounters setbacks is more likely to regain his position in the world than a bachelor. Partly because his beloved needs to live with him, which encourages him to work hard, but mainly because his spirit has the warmth and comfort of a family, and his self-esteem is also active, feeling that although the outside world is dark and submissive, there is still a small world of love within the family… On the other hand, bachelors are most prone to self-abandonment, always seeking solitude and indulgence, and their hearts easily become ruins, like a desolate house, simply because it lacks a resident."</p>
<p>This judgment is correct. Historically, many heroes and warriors, when they were down on their luck and on the verge of despair, relied on the power of the opposite sex to revive them. Women are like flexible fingers, but they are also tempered steel. Thanks to their support, they often shape men's strong character and indomitable spirit. Look at how people are generally unremarkable in their youth before marriage, but as they enter middle age and old age, their careers shine brightly. Shouldn't this also be attributed to the encouragement of love from the opposite sex? I can't help but think of Gorky's words: "If there is no love, why do you want to live in the world!"</p>
<p>The poet Milton once sang, "The fragrant scent emitted by marriage is sweeter than a violet bed." A wife who provides support and comfort is precious, and those who have wives are truly happy. Five or six years ago, when I read Gorky's "Reminiscences of Andreyev," I felt this way, and I still secretly envied this melancholic writer for having such a wife: she could be a passionate lover, and she could also treat Andreyev with maternal love and care. Moreover, she deeply understood the meaning of his talent and the painful fluctuations in his mood. She "constantly used all her strength, sacrificing her entire personality for her husband." To young, unmarried people, this might seem like a "standard wife"! However, while "secretly envying," I can't help but feel sorry for this "Lady Xira": why should a woman sacrifice even her own personality for her husband? I thought.</p>
<p>In the play "Annoying Society" by French writer Édouard Pailleron, Paul Laimond, who uses "salon" as a "stepping stone," says to his wife Xiahen, "When I came in, I was a county magistrate, but when I leave, I should be a prefect. Everything depends on you." It is said that in French society, a man is often judged by his wife, so whether Paul can be promoted depends entirely on his wife. However, Chinese society is different. A wife takes pride in her husband's glory and shame in his humiliation. Women have been serving men by sacrificing their entire personalities for ages. This is a great disgrace for women! It is certainly necessary for women to share hardships and joys with men, understand each other, and encourage each other. But if it goes so far as to sacrifice the entire personality, the result is equivalent to a docile sheep that obeys everything. Generation after generation, women can only and will always be appendages of men; strictly speaking, they are slaves of men. Just as the famous Soviet poet Nekrasov roared for the lowly rural women of the Tsarist era:</p>
<p>"Entering the coffin at death, still a slave!"</p>

<h3>The Homecoming of a Dancing Queen</h3>
<p>— Written by Cheng Xiaoqing</p>
<p>Chapter Six: A Dangerous Experience</p>
<p>Ni Jinshou's astonishing reply only earned him a cold laugh from the young man. He stared at Ni Jinshou again, then fell silent once more. Ni Jinshou, on the other hand, felt somewhat embarrassed, as this cold laugh was indeed unexpected to me as well. Ni Jinshou lowered his head for a moment, then suddenly pulled out his notebook from his pocket.</p>
<p>While flipping through the notebook, he said, "Do you think I'm falsely accusing you without proof? Listen, let me give you a few pieces of evidence: Your relationship with Wang Lilan has been going on for quite some time, often taking advantage of Lu Jiansheng's absence to spend the night at her place—her place is at 27 Qingpu Road."</p>
<p>Ni Jinshou's gaze shifted from his notebook to Yu Ertang's face, but Yu Ertang no longer had the courage to meet his eyes, instead looking down at the tips of his own leather shoes. At this moment, I also noticed his shoes. The shoes were made of yellow textured leather with pointed toes, which seemed different from the two male leather shoe prints I had just traced in the corpse house. Although the two prints were of different sizes, they were both round.</p>
<p>Ni Jinshou continued looking at the notebook and said, "Recently, Wang Lilan has had a new lover, Zhao Boxiong. It's not surprising for such a romantic woman to abandon the old for the new. But you took it seriously and started to hate her. On the eleventh, you and this Zhao Boxiong met, and you clashed. At that time, Wang Lilan defended her new love, openly rejecting you. This made you hate her even more, leading to the intention to murder. This is your motive for killing."</p>
<p>The young man was no longer as quiet as before. Although he was still silently lowering his head, I could see that there was no color in his cheeks.</p>
<p>Ni Jinshou added, "Is this a false accusation? ... Alright, listen again: On the evening of the sixteenth, you went to her house and secretly inquired about her and Zhao Boxiong's movements from the old servant. On the night of the seventeenth, you went to room 774 on the seventh floor of the Yadong Hotel to investigate, and learned that Wang Lilan had spent the previous night there—this room 774 was Zhao Boxiong's residence."</p>
<p>Yu Ertang's expression became even more uneasy. He was biting his lip, and his head seemed so heavy that he could no longer hold it up. This expression gave Ni Jinshou a sense of excitement, and he continued to declare the young man's crimes.</p>

<h3>Tiger</h3>
<p>— Xiu Bi</p>
<p>I dreamed that I was in a forest, holding a sword, like a warrior.</p>
<p>A fierce tiger stood in front of me, roaring.</p>
<p>I angrily raised my sword, shouting:</p>
<p>"I will slay you, you cruel beast, you evil devil!"</p>
<p>"Haha! Cruel," the tiger roared in reply: "I am not as cruel as humans."</p>
<p>"Nonsense!" I swung my sword.</p>
<p>"I kill the weak only for hunger, but not to establish my own reputation. I do not use words to decorate this hypocritical crime, nor do I want others to praise my slaughter."</p>
<p>"Nonsense." My voice was much weaker than before.</p>
<p>"Moreover, I kill the weak only with my teeth and claws, but not with iron and gunpowder, fire and machines. I kill the weak only with my own physical strength, but not with any trickery or conspiracy... Furthermore, my roar only kills one life, but what about you humans? Some people, with one roar, kill..."</p>
<p>Without hearing the end of its words, I finally lowered my sword and bowed my head.</p>
<p>"Humans! What can you say?" the fierce tiger said, laughing.</p>
<p>I could not say anything, and I remained silent until I woke up from the dream.</p>

<h3>Reflections by the Window</h3>
<p>— Ming Mang</p>
<p>The clear blue, seemingly bottomless sky, peers in through the window. This sky, filled with the glory of the setting sun, pulsating with brilliant music, makes me sink into longing reflections, even though it is just a square.</p>
<p>However, standing by the window, I gaze at it yearningly. Suddenly, I feel that this square of blue sky is gradually expanding; expanding in all directions. It is like a vast ocean, boundless and profound. And directly beneath this blue sea is the lovely golden field. The summer sun shines down, sparkling and dancing. The waves of wheat roll forward, crossing this boundless expanse; this is the bountiful land of the motherland.</p>
<p>The mountains and forests, deep and dark, tall and lush. The mountain ridges, countless peaks rising, firm and sturdy. Is this a surge of life's brute force from the earth? One peak after another, horizontally arranged, the deep blue sky is extraordinarily vivid and vibrant.</p>
<p>I think, I think silently, I know from letters from friends about the exciting news from the motherland's fields. I am immersed in fantasy, I fantasize about those exciting lives and news! Those admirable friends' strong will and faith.</p>
<p>"The importance of freedom far outweighs our lives!"</p>
<p>My friend's letter says so. Facing this square of blue sky outside the window, I repeat and silently read it, thinking about what this sentence means to them.</p>
<p>But in this narrow cage, I only intensify my longing, my memories, for that ocean-like blue sky, the boundless fields, and the surging dark mountains and forests, and those exciting companions and exciting days...</p>
<p>I long for a land of freedom, and I cannot suppress it.</p>

<h3>Headache and Intelligence</h3>
<p>— Hua Zhi</p>
<p>Intellectuals often suffer from periodic headaches or asthma, usually regarded as a symbol of ill health. However, according to the latest medical theories, these two symptoms are considered signs of intelligence, purely physiological, and medicine is ineffective.</p>
<p>This is based on a recent presentation by Professor Bayer of Oklahoma City University to the Mexican Medical Association. He said: "Some people's headaches are actually a slight indication of excessive super-intelligence, because they have very complex nervous systems. The extreme development of these nervous systems can stimulate the psychological aspects, thus turning into migraines and asthma."</p>
<p>"As for whether women suffering from this symptom should also be regarded as intelligent, this question is worth studying. However, some women are indeed more alert than men, which may be the result of advanced intelligence development."</p>
<p>"In short, people with dynamism, whether male or female, are prone to headaches and asthma. There are few medical treatments for this; if any, it is only rest."</p>
<h3>Bleeding</h3>
<p>— Liu Jiagan</p>
<p>When it is necessary to bleed, do not fear bleeding.</p>
<p>When there is no need to bleed, strive to avoid bleeding.</p>
<p>Bleeding should have a price, because there is nothing more precious than blood in the body.</p>
<p>Remember: blood is red, it should not be "shed in vain!"</p>

<h3>Cao Yu on the Future of Chinese Spoken Drama</h3>
<p>— Rong Shang</p>
<p>Since "Zheng Zai Xiang" ("Thinking") was performed in Shanghai, public opinion has been full of praise. Cao Yu's reputation and status in the theater world have undoubtedly been increasing day by day. I remember that in the twenty-sixth year (1937), he gave a public lecture at the Literary Research Association of Central University on the topic "The Path Chinese Spoken Drama Should Take," and there were many insightful views at the time. Here, I have excerpted some important paragraphs from it, so that we have the opportunity to revisit the proverbs of this progressive playwright. It should be of some help to the vibrant Shanghai spoken drama scene today!</p>
<p>"From all aspects, the progress of Chinese spoken drama is indeed very satisfactory, but it still cannot be considered perfect. The current achievements are far from the ideal goal!"</p>
<p>"First: Although Chinese spoken drama is gradually approaching reality, it is not profound. It is only a superficial approach, not a real one. It can bring some social problems to the stage, but it does not connect the entire real social life."</p>
<p>"Second: Chinese spoken drama cannot be universal. Spoken drama is not entertainment. May I ask how many people can afford to spend 1.6 yuan to go to the theater in this day and age? Most of the people who really want to see plays have no way to enter the theater. If this continues, the Chinese spoken drama movement is very dangerous. Failure to universalize is failure to popularize."</p>
<p>"Third: Chinese spoken drama is not yet truly Chinese. To use flowers as an analogy, all literature and art are like flowers. Flowers cannot grow without soil. Chinese flowers should have Chinese soil. However, most Chinese spoken dramas do not have Chinese soil. Specifically, Chinese spoken drama is too abstract and conceptualized and cannot be linked to China's current real environment and real life."</p>
<p>"Fourth: It is a matter of skill. Chinese spoken drama has not yet completely learned Western techniques and applied them. No matter what, if you learn something that doesn't look like it, it's like eating something without digesting it."</p>
<p>"Although some people have noticed these points, they often make the mistake of being formulaic and idealistic. They only know how to touch people with preaching words, but they do not know how to touch people with emotions. The result only gives people a formula. This point must be improved. As for universalization, it is even more difficult to achieve. True art must be integrated with real society. Past spoken dramas could only express a part of social life. If the entire modern Chinese society is integrated into spoken drama, then its content will naturally be more substantial."</p>
<h3>Ten Ways of Kissing</h3>
<p>— Luo Cun</p>
<p>The films produced by Hollywood companies, whether comedies, tragedies, court dramas, martial arts films, erotic films, literary films, or supernatural films, all have kissing scenes. This is something movie fans have seen. However, there are different ways of kissing. According to a Hollywood film critic, there are no more than the following ten ways:</p>
<p>(1) Sweet Kiss: When the distance between the two parties is more than two feet, and they lean forward to kiss each other, it is called a sweet kiss.</p>
<p>(2) Passionate Kiss: A passionate kiss is when two people hug each other tightly and kiss.</p>
<p>(3) Lingering Kiss: A kiss that is repeated more than twice in a row is called a lingering kiss.</p>
<p>(4) Cheek Kiss: When party A kisses the cheek of party B, it is called a cheek kiss. (This kiss also exists in our country, which is called kissing the face.)</p>
<p>(5) Loud Kiss: A kiss that is short and quick, while absorbing outside air, and making a sound when kissing, is called a loud kiss.</p>
<p>(6) Touching Kiss: A kiss that is still possible when there is an object between the two parties is called a touching kiss. (This type of kiss is most often used in prison scenes.)</p>
<p>(7) Shy Kiss: A shy kiss is when someone wants to kiss but doesn't, hesitates, and then kisses after all.</p>
<p>(8) Pouting Lips: When party A is willing to be kissed by party B, they first purse their lips to indicate they are waiting to be kissed.</p>
<p>(9) Back-of-the-Ear Kiss: When two people hug each other, they kiss each other's necks, called a back-of-the-ear kiss.</p>
<p>(10) Tip-of-the-Nose Kiss: Touching each other with the tips of their noses is called a tip-of-the-nose kiss, which in our country is also called measuring noses.</p>
<h3>Tidbits of the Chrysanthemum Stage</h3>
<p>— Shan</p>
<p>(1)</p>
<p>Mei WanHua's most popular period was in the old capital Tian Le Yuan in the years of the Republic of China twenty-two and twenty-three (1933-1934), when ticket prices rose from 19 copper coins to 22 coins, and even to 36 coins. Before long, he was invited to Shanghai. After returning north, he played the first day of Fen He Wan at the Wenming Tea Garden, listed in a major role. It was February 7th, four years of the Republic of China (1915). Mr. Mei picked up the main role starting this day.</p>
<p>(2)</p>
<p>When Zhu QinXin was at her peak, her name could be compared with the Four Great Dan Actresses. In recent years, due to environmental reasons, she has gradually declined. Her face is too thin. When singing, she uses two sponges in her mouth to make her face look plumper. It seems very strenuous, but QinXin doesn't care.</p>
<p>(3)</p>
<p>Jin ShaoShan liked to spend money extravagantly. He had a great addiction to sex, singing, dogs, and horses. A few years ago, in Shanghai, he spent more than 500 yuan to buy a golden-eyed green-haired tortoise. He raised it in a specially made glass bowl and specially prepared more than 100 tables of lavish banquets to hold a tortoise celebration party. Those who received the invitation were all baffled.</p>

<p>Although Hou YuLan's clothing is very simple, her powder box is extremely exquisite. The box is in the shape of a square antique with the three characters "Hou YuLan" engraved on it. Two small light bulbs are installed on both sides of the mirror, which is beautiful!</p>
<p>(5)</p>
<p>Some people say: Listening to the Tan School opera is like drinking a glass of milk. Jiao Tian is a glass of pure milk, which tastes sweet and fresh. Shu Yan has diluted it with half a glass of boiled water. Although it still looks like milk, the taste is half lighter. Fu Ying is one-third milk, mixed with two-thirds boiled water, and added some white sugar. The sweet ingredient is sugar rather than milk. Ma LianLiang is completely a glass of condensed milk, with a lot of white sugar added, which is terribly sweet.</p>

<p>Xiao ChangHua's words always stick to his profession. He repaired Xu BaoFang's tomb the year before last, Yang XiaoLou died, and he mediated the disputes after his death. This old man was very busy. When asked, he said: "I'm just busy for the 'Xu Yang Two Families.' "Xu Yang Two Families" are the lyrics of the Two into the Palace opera.</p>
<h3>Chen JuanJuan's Lofty Aspirations</h3>
<p>— Han Mei</p>
<p>Chen JuanJuan's entry into the film industry was first discovered by Lianhua Film Company. Films such as Little Orphan Girl and The Prodigal Lamb were greatly praised by movie fans. After August 13th (1937), Chen sister went abroad to perform in Singapore and raise donations for national salvation from overseas Chinese, giving great excitement to overseas Chinese.</p>
<p>Last winter, Chen JuanJuan returned from her travels abroad. The little angel of the Chinese film industry was recruited by Zhang Shankun, a giant of Chinese film, and signed a one-year contract with Guolian Film Company. JuanJuan's intention was that the monthly salary was not important, as long as she could support her family. Her ambition was to display her art on the silver screen.</p>
<p>After JuanJuan returned to Shanghai, her life has been stabilized by Guolian. In addition to filming, she is now hiring teachers to teach her Chinese, English, drawing, and music, striving in academics, and her aspirations are quite lofty. As for film production, in addition to co-starring with Chen YanYan in "Du Shiniang," Guolian has prepared and planned a new film "Snow White" for her, with the intention of making JuanJuan conform to her personality and give full play to her genius. Chen Shu lost her father early and was raised by her grandmother. Feeling adrift, she excels in tragic plays. If she is self-motivated, it will not be difficult for her to stand out. The picture on the right is a recent photo of JuanJuan, innocent and lively, which can be seen from a glimpse.</p>
<h3>Hu Wenhu Invests, A Pioneer in the Film Industry</h3>
<p>— Hai Xing</p>
<p>"Star Alliance" Expresses a Solemn Stance</p>
<p>The productions of the three government-run companies in Chongqing, "China," "China Electric," and the Northwest Film Studio of Shaanxi, have established the China Film Joint Company two months ago in order to unify the distribution routes. Luo Mingyou, the founder of the former Lianhua, was appointed as the manager to handle overseas distribution matters. Singaporian tycoon Hu Changyao and others are now organizing the Star Alliance Film Company, publicly declaring that they will be enemies with boring films. The company has the full support of Hu Wenhu, and the Sing Tao Daily and other media are its propaganda organs, so its momentum is huge. The productions of "China," "China Electric," and "Northwest" factories have all been unified under Star Alliance management, stating its position as follows: "In order to promote the market for domestic films, resist the cultural aggression of foreign films, increase the effectiveness of anti-Japanese film propaganda, and eliminate the popularity of poisonous and anesthetizing films, in addition to directing the Singapore branch of the China Film Joint Company in the British colony, this company also represents the British colony distribution rights of Hong Kong's DaGuan, LianAn, and GuoGuang companies." It is said that this is Hu Wenhu's first investment in the film industry, and he may actively develop in the film industry in the future.</p>
<h3>Chess Garden</h3>
<p>— Edited by Putian Lian Xue Zheng</p>
<p>Game 200: Evenly Matched - Proposed by Xue Yashan</p>
<p>Red to Move and Draw</p>
<p>Unveiling the Solution to the Micro-Answer Game of Two Fishing Golden Turtles (Red to Move and Draw)</p>
<p>Rook 1 retreats 2, Pawn 8 advances, General 4 advances 1, Rook 1 moves to 5, General 4 moves to 5</p>
<p>Rook 2 advances 1, General 5 retreats 1, Cannon 9 advances 3, Rook 1 retreats 6, Pawn 7 advances</p>
<p>General 5 moves to 6, Rook 2 advances 1, General 6 advances 1, Guard 5 moves to 6, Pawn 7 advances</p>
<p>Advisor 5 retreats 4 (variant), Rook 1 advances 4, Rook 2 retreats 1, General 6 advances 1, Rook 2 advances 1</p>
<p>Elephant 5 advances 3, Rook 2 retreats 4, Rook 1 advances 5, Guard 6 advances 1, Elephant 3 retreats 1</p>
<p>Rook 2 moves to 3, Rook 1 moves to 6, Rook 3 moves to 2, Rook 6 moves to 2, Rook 2 advances 4</p>
<p>Rook 2 retreats 4, Guard 6 advances 1, Rook 2 moves to 4, Guard 6 moves to 5, Rook 4 moves to 5</p>
<p>Guard 5 moves to 6, General 6 retreats 1, Rook 2 retreats 1, General 6 retreats 1, Rook 2 retreats 1</p>
<p>Rook 5 moves to 4, Guard 6 moves to 5, Rook 4 moves to 6, Guard 5 moves to 6, Elephant 1 advances 3</p>
<p>Rook 2 moves to 3, General 6 advances 1, Rook 3 advances 1, General 6 advances 1, Rook 3 advances 1</p>
<p>Rook 6 moves to 4, Guard 6 moves to 5, Rook 4 moves to 5, Guard 5 moves to 6, Rook 5 advances 3</p>
<p>Rook 3 moves to 4, General 6 moves to 5, Rook Call moves to 5, General 5 moves to 6, Rook 5 retreats 8</p>
<p>Pawn 6 advances (draw)</p>
<p>(Note) Among the gentlemen who responded to this game, the best one measured that after the advisor 5 retreats 4, the red side abandoned the elephant to draw (that is, rook 1 advances 9 to capture the advisor, and the black rook takes the elephant for checkmate in the middle, easier to draw.) I think that Rook 1 advancing 4 to preserve the red elephant is the correct move. If so, the black rook must stay on roads 1, 2 and 3 when checking the general until road 6-3 so that the red general cannot move to 5 or retreat 1 in order to draw. I think that all are red wins, does Gao Ming agree? Chuan Rong Nian attached for enlightenment.</p>
<p>According to the above methods, it is most reasonable. (Editor)</p>
