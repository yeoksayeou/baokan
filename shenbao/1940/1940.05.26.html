<p>社評</p>
<h3>靜觀蘇聯</h3>
<p>兩週以來，隨着西歐戰事的擴大，世人注目之標的，不僅限於血戰方酣的英法和德國，且更集中於現猶中立的美義和蘇聯；這是因為美義蘇都是世界强國，其行止舉足重輕之故。交戰國的實力因交戰而日益毀損减削，相反的，美義蘇聯三國現在正因為尙未捲入漩渦，所以能彀保持並且增加其一切力量，同時也就更增加了這三國的重要性；因此之故，他們的動態如何，當然將重大影響於未來之國際局面，為世人注意之所集中。現在的大勢很顯明：美國熱烈同情英法，而義大利則有所偏袒於德國。這幾天，美國議會以最迅速的步驟，通過十五萬萬元的海軍特別預算案和十八萬萬元的陸軍特別預算案，其目的當然在對抗侵略國家的新威脅，並含有聲援英法之作用。至於義大利，則無論是報紙言論，或民衆聚會，都充滿了反英反法的呼聲；政府當局，也在盤馬彎弓，躍躍欲動。雖然基於種種複雜矛盾的環境，義大利未必就在短時期內加入德方，對抗英法，美國更不至於立即加入英法方面對德作戰，但是美國之袒英法，和義大利之袒德，色彩却極鮮明。只有蘇聯，近來久安緘默，靜觀世變，其態度的隱晦，行動的審慎，為任何國家所不及；而其立國北方，地跨歐亞兩洲，其地位重要，尤勝義大利，而與美國相伯仲，故其可能的動態，有加以剖視的必要。</p>
<p>請先觀察蘇聯在歐洲的地位。蘇聯在歐洲地位之强化，莫過於今日。波蘭東部，已為蘇所占據；波羅的海三國（愛沙尼亞，拉脫維亞，立陶宛），都和蘇聯訂有互助協定；對芬戰事結束後，勘界工作，最近也已完成；這數國，原來不足為蘇聯之患，但在主觀上，蘇聯因此而得清除肘腋之憂；此外更為重要的，當然還是去年蘇德互不侵犯協定的訂立，釋嫌樽俎，化敵為友，自是蘇聯在歐洲的莫大成功。本來英法和德義諸國，都是資本主義國家，在本質上與蘇聯對立，時時有共組「反蘇十字軍」的可能；一九三八年的慕尼黑會議隱然以排擠蘇聯為期間的憧憧黑影。但是蘇德不侵協定的簽訂，表明了資本主義國家間內在的矛盾，更大於對蘇聯的矛盾，不久而第二次歐洲大戰爆發。自此之後，不但德國有所求於蘇聯，就是英法對蘇也未敢公然相抗；英蘇商務談判，仍在若斷若續中進行着，便是蘇聯在歐洲地位强化的明徵。從種種方面推測現時蘇聯當局對歐戰前途的觀察，大概是這樣的：假如德國失敗了，中歐將長期受戰後貧窮饑寒災害的憂患，很可能的投入蘇聯懷抱，那時蘇聯更强大了；戰後英法徧體瘡痍，當然亦不作對付蘇聯之想。假如英法一再敗績，而尙有餘勇可賣，對德國不甘屈服，則美國為本身利益打算，為防止納粹的威脅波及美洲起見，勢將出而援救英法，以期重建歐洲均勢；因此而英法和德國的對抗一日繼續存在，蘇聯必一日自保安全於局外。所以歐洲戰局無論如何發展，將無所害於蘇聯，反而更可增强蘇聯在歐洲的地位。上述兩種假定，是歐洲大局在最近將來演變的歧途；蘇聯得始終坐視歧途的決定，而無所用其憂疑彷徨；所成為問題的，假定德義作更密切的團結，踐踏英法，而將形成主宰歐陸的壓倒的優勢，則蘇聯為較遠的將來打算，是否始終坐視。容忍至何程度？抑或與德義更相結合以冀共分杯羹？這是絕大問題。</p>
<p>蘇聯的危險地帶，還是在遠東方面；蘇聯最主要的敵手，還是日本。這可以由近來日本的輿論見之。自從最近歐戰擴大後，日本輿論界幾乎一致迫切的呼號着，怎樣纔能從速結束「中國事變」，以便向歐戰中去收漁人之利；他們的見解，以為英國方以全力對德作戰，在遠東有向日本軟化的可能，美國只要日本避免再刺激她，也未必就會和日本決裂；但對於蘇聯，却一致敵視。以吾們的觀察，日本人對英美所想像的，完全是自欺的錯覺。美國是文明大國，總統羅斯福氏有遠見，有抱負，決不會妥協於侵略者，自不必說。即以英國而論，他方以反侵略的理論來對德作戰，來保持其舉國團結的情緒，決不能以對日妥協來自毀的魂靈，何况內有邱吉爾氏當國，意識明確而堅定，絕不同於綏靖主義的張伯倫；外與美國融和之不暇，豈能與美國國策相背馳。而日本對蘇聯，則因決不容其鄰國盛强，她的侵略中國者以此，其以蘇聯為敵者亦以此。中蘇兩國，都和日本疆土昆連，兩國人民，又都能奮發上進；這在褊狹嫉忌貪婪的日本人之心目中，以為祗要中蘇疲弱，則整個亞洲大陸，應該整個是日本的私產了；這是日本所咬牙切齒，所以必侵中國而敵蘇聯。故中國强,日本既怨且怒；而蘇聯在歐洲的地位愈鞏固，則在遠東所受日本的嫉恨也愈深。這樣微妙的樞紐，重大的關係，當然為蘇聯政府所重視，而必集中力量加以對付的。所以英蘇兩國的商務談判，不絕如縷，甚或竟能締結貿易協定；同時蘇德關係，蘇聯方面亦努力保持其恰到好處。蘇聯在歐洲國際的巧妙運籌，務使其地位鞏固　到主於毫無遺憾，這正是與其遠東政策的剛健，對日本的深惡痛絕，互為因果，互為表衷；而日本朝野的一致反蘇，僅是蘇聯態度的反面說明而已。</p>

<h3>不列帝國日　英王廣播演說　自由正義爲作戰目標　盼萬衆一心博取勝利</h3>
<p>倫敦　英王喬治六世昨晚向全國發表帝國紀念日廣播演說云世人須辯明吾國敵人之目的、已不復爲佔領土地、實欲澈底傾復帝國及其所有之一切、然後再征服全世界、倘彼等果能如願、必將使其已表現之一切憎惡及殘暴底於完成、吾人誠難信人類心理中、竟有如此兇惡之計劃、但懷疑之時期已早成過去矣、目前帝國人民及世人之具有目光及善意者、對於此種情形業已瞭然、去年帝國紀念日、朕曾由加拿大中心之溫尼倍格　帝國人，致辭、是日所言者爲吾自由人民聯邦基礎之自由。公道。及和平概念、其後戰雲密佈、朕仍切望上述各項概念或尙能樹立更充足之發展、而使人民免受戰爭屠殺之痛苦、但結果竟反是、吾人所不斷努力、並以一切誠意冀求避免之禍患終於降臨、吾人至此時始恍然大悟、因所顯示者爲籌備已久、欲以武力征服世界各民族之計畫、故吾人之一切和平努力皆成泡影也、</p>

<h3>歐洲戰時三都景象（三）　西綫大戰前巴黎柏林的對照</h3>
<p>即使擠滿了買客的大商店中，裏面也沉靜得很。出售女飾，珠寳，珍物，絲綢和一切奢侈品的舖子中，存貨頗爲充足，其他各貨多已售罄。出售的衣服上面標着價目和百分數點，買客們對於規定額白分數點的减少，比之所標的售價，還要感覺興味。店鋪的陳列櫥窗中擺滿了各式的新貨品，但是你如果要照樣選購一二，舖店裏的人却告訴你說：這是作爲「裝飾」的而已。在德國撑着門面的是當局，但是櫉窗中的擺設倒引起若干德人的疑慮，以爲戰時的存儲恐怕沒有表現着得充足呢。</p>
<p>巴黎情形熱鬧，聲息很多，交通方便。路燈不過翻轉了些，門燈很多點着的，窗帘也多不經意的拉掩一二。市面上沒有實行規定額的制度，可見貨色還不虞缺乏。食品限制的方法很簡單，規定某某幾天不准出售某某等貨。一星期中有三天沒有肉吃，其他幾大沒有麪食，酒，或糖果。法國人雖然考究飲食，但是對於這種限制，只不過聳聳肩胛，不像德國人雖時要討論到吃和飲的問題。德國的持家婦爲了尋求食物，不知要化了多少時候，她們的嗅覺非常靈敏，如果有個商人獲得不受規定額限制的食物—譬如堅果，橘子，之類—他們把道種東西一經陳列出來，摩肩接踵而來的德國太太，不知旣有幾許了。</p>
<p>戰事的疲勞存正於兩國之間。七年以來德國整軍經武，一刻沒有休息。待到最後關頭，他們的效力和忍耐也已到達頂點了。就兵士來講，實際上還比民間力量爲好。一個年輕的工兵，當家屬們稱讚他容光煥發時說：「我再前綫有充分的休息，和良好的飲食」。但是民間工廠和田間的出產的見滯鈍，不論刺戟或責罰，都不能使這第二綫上的戰士更加努力些。其實他們太疲乏了。婦女們難爲無米之炊，實已筋疲力盡。有幾處地方，據說孩童們也發生厭倦了。敎師們在學校裏，以無法把「我的奮鬥史」，和一切納粹主義，使他們發生趣味。</p>
<p>我們都有一種感想，覺得國家社會黨的革命已經漸成尾聲，在一方面變爲格外的急進，另一方面表示厭倦和幻想的消滅。要不是這次的戰事關係，這種趣勢將格外明顯。但是戰事已把納粹和反納粹兩者鍛成一體。他們由於不斷的宜傳，說英國要把德國擊碎了，於是大家起來一致對外；成爲國家的武力。百姓們希望和平比了法國人還要殷切，多數人都相信，如果大規模的戰爭不能避免的話，那末德國一定可以獲得勝利的。我們常常可以聽到他們說：「八月裏各種事情都要結束了，我們的困難也將告一段落哩」。</p>
<p>在法國沒有人敢預測戰事的結束期。法國相信，到底他會獲得勝利，並且沒有表示說這次戰爭是短暫而容易的。德國政府的用意，似乎要轉移人民的注意，不叫他們感覺危險。實到目下爲止，柏林還沒有發生眞要被轟炸的驚恐。巴黎政府好像想叫百姓們明白，戰事並不是兒戲的，危險隨時可來。法國人相信這是對的，不過他們不願意驚惶失措。如果德國人不拚命努力至頂點，法國人也就不會　之次骨了。最奇怪的，就是這次戰爭對於兩方面都未曾引起絕大的興奮。柏林遲緩而抑鬱地行動着，茫茫前塵，不知如何結束。巴黎的心情和神色比較的輕鬆，但是內心並不如此。德國人在燈火管制之下，一無所見；法國人在半明不滅之中，看得太淸楚了些。（譯紐的泰晤士報）</p>

<h3>投機興趣索然　金市風平浪靜</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤、風利浪靜、爲最近金市少見之姿態、緣外滙穩平不變、經營者興趣淡然、大戶則坐視環境之發展、再定買賣計劃、本日經過、晨初尙爲五千八百元、較上日低十五元、雖不久抬起五元、但錢兌業突來求售、於買主難覓中吿撳、達五千七百六十五元、後賴證券帮相當吸收、復回升至五千八百元、惟結果僅五千七百八十六元、較上日軋小二十九元、午後週六無市、半天交易不多、約一千三百兩光景、銀樓飾金初平、後吿掛小十元、海關金等仍平、</p>

<h3>破鈔票問題</h3>
<p>— 陳鑫奎</p>
<p>近來因有幾家重要銀行，對於破爛鈔票，不予收受，除非經過一種例外手續，如鈔錄號碼，繕具淸單之後，才可於規定約地點，予以接納。這種辦法，起初仃使在銀行與往來頻繁的大商行之間，嗣後有若干商店爲向銀行解款不易，遂於門市生意，也限制破票的收入；最近則連郵局方面，遇有破爛鈔票，也要婉言謝却了。</p>
<p>據說銀行界當初的意思是「故意損壞小予兌換」。怎樣叫做故意損壞呢？凡一張嶄新的鈔票，給人有意撕成上下左右兩片或三四片，然後用紙黏併起來，不論點合的所在，是否密切牢固，都叫做故意損壞。不過這「故意」兩個字的界說，頗不容易弄淸楚，有心惡作劇把一張新鈔票撕下一隻角來，當然是「故意」；但偶小經心，香烟在鈔票上燒成一個窟窿，用客觀的看法，明明是無心，若用主觀的看法，誰燒成窟窿誰負責任，無心也要當「故意」算了。並且，新鈔票黏併後尙不通用，則舊鈔票黏補過的，自然更不能通用。兼之，「破」的範圍，也是大小不一，對半拉開是「破」，邊緣擦損和一角脫落，何嘗不是「破」？「故意」的意義含混，「破損」的程度無定，收款人對破爛鈔票的判斷，失了標準，爲謹慎之故，祗好對於有一點兒破損的鈔票就拒絕小收。這樣，謹愼」就變爲挑剔」，「挑剔」的結果，使破舊鈔票流通的範圍日趨狹窄，在手中握有破舊鈔票的人士，委　感覺不便，尤其是　袋中僅存破票子一張，而東西已經買好，或者點心已經　下肚去，付款時忽遭賬檯上退回，彼時的窘急氣惱，確乎使人受小住，所以口舌爭論和衝突糾紛，往往是在所難免。</p>
<p>銀行方面拒收破鈔票，是有相當的根據和道理的：一則破爛鈔票旣然已有指定的兌換塲所，執行其他職務的部分，爲節省時間的關係，自有拒收破票子的理由：再則印刷鈔票的成本頗大，例如一張單元鈔票，在以前物價便宜的時候，尙須一角左右，如今樣樣都貴，鈔票的紙張印刷等費用，也要加上幾倍，試想一張好好的新鈔票，原來至少可用二十年的，忽然給人有意損壞，使耐用的年限大大縮短，發行鈔票的銀行，豈不損失很　？爲儆戒道種公物不知愛惜的人起見，對於故意損壞的鈔票不予兌換，豈不很是應該？</p>
<p>大概是由於缺乏智識及不顧公德的緣故，許多人行用鈔票，眞是一點也不肯當心：有的人將鈔票摺成像豆腐乾樣一塊，有的人將鈔票搓成香烟捲一般，有的人將鈔票捏做字紙團兒一個，有的人將我回來的大小鈔票，一把抓起即往袋中一塞，簡直亂得一塌糊塗。此外，熱心敎徒在票邊上加印「快信耶穌」的戳記，投機商人在空白處添註凍瘃藥膏」的標語，管賬先生在水印叫周蓋印店號圖章，打油詩人在票面題上「何日君再來」的佳句，未來的銀行大家，於原有的簽字旁邊，七歪八豎的增加他私人的簽字同印鑑，總之，一張很完整的鈔票，被許多無聊的人們，在有意無意之間，亂畫亂塗，弄得五勞七傷，瘡痍滿目，實在糟糕得不成樣子。</p>
<p>世界上的事常常是不公平的，闖禍的人常不是受罪的人，受罪的是別一種人；另外有一種人，非獨不受罪，還可因他人的闖禍而獲益。譬如有意損壞鈔票的人，當然已早把該項破票用了出去，收進破票的，常是不屑同人錙銖必較的好好先生，受到意外利益的，則是一批「專收破爛鈔票車資特別克已」的烟紙店家。目今游資充斥於上海及其附近區域的號稱三十萬萬元，假定其中的六分之一是現鈔，現鈔中的百分之五是破鈔票，則破鈔票已有二千五百萬元之多，再假定每元破票兌給烟紙店須貼水五分，則好好先生們的貼水損失，便須有一百二十五萬元之鉅。根據大家的經騐，日常進出的鈔票中，以半新舊的票子居最多數，破舊票子居次多數，全新票子居最少數，自大家檢點鈔票採嚴格主義以來，破舊鈔票所賸下的空隙，一時得不着補充，致市面上的籌碼頗有小敷流轉之象，尤以單元鈔票的缺乏爲特別顯著，據說每千單元鈔票的兌換率，升水已在二元以上，由此可見流通在上海一帶的破奮鈔票，必速在二千五百萬元以外，莫怪烟紙店家收兌破票的紅字招貼，有如新春餅攤的「應時春餅」牌子樣，掛的人家，愈來愈多了。</p>
<p>在銀行所收回去的破舊鈔票中，實際上還可以使用的票子，必定不少，將來市面上需要籌碼的時候，這些仍堪使用的破鈔票會不會再發出來呢？還有，眼前握有破鈔票的人們，旣以無辜的好好先生們爲多，那末銀行收兌破鈔票的辦法能否改善一些，或者收兌破票的塲所可吾增多與普遍一些，使無辜的人兒，减少一點意外的損失與苦痛呢（完）</p>
<h3>南洋運輸困難　麵粉交易有限</h3>
<p>粉市交易、殊見況靜、查容銷方面、北洋　去化久靜、南洋港幫、以目下運輸較爲困難、前辦之貨、尙未裝淸、故新交易相繼觀望、祇賴本街零批交易之日常需要、爲數殊屬有限、且近來內地幫一度動辦無錫粉後、順風山鹿及雙獅等牌、已運去不少、聞產地市價報漲、已乏餘額運申、故形勢獨俏、惟售價已與廠盤相差無幾、故進戶方面不免畏怯、市乃續趨擯持、老車牌回籠粉亦在相持中、市面呼吸、當待諸新麥上市、二十六日運香港六千五百包、</p>
<h3>油餅　把持油市　一跌又上騰</h3>
<p>邇來豆油市況、本因各路銷場非常清淡、來源　續不絕、致存底充溢、（桶油約存八千餘桶、簍油七千餘件、故大局呆滯、祇恃操縱者强行支持耳、惟合作大連油公司中有一部份心思不一、昨市忽起反動、大連油實行甩價、上午收盤比上日猛挫五元、爲八十五元、至午後該公司開緊急會議、實行强制、市而立即恢復原價、爲九十元、發表成交數爲二百桶、其他祇開烟岐油一百三十件、價爲六十二元原盤云、</p>
<p>豆子二十六日運食港九白二十三包、又同日運　港茶油三百二十聽、生油二千九百九十三聽、</p>
<h3>紗花　現紗粵銷尚佳</h3>
<p>紗市續趨下落、且局勢軟化、此因歐戰劇烈、人心看疲、但現紗銷塲尙稱不弱、香港帮零星採辦續而不斷也、所以頽勢又可挽回不少、</p>
<p>現紗晨開尙屬和平、因杳港帮對於雙馬需要繼續不懈、人氣安定、二十支雙馬價爲一千二百九十五元、，比上日跌上院、旋聞外匯及金價平庸、浮多復來斬結、市情傾向下挫、至跌二千二百十元、價低之後、引起空頭抵補、徐徐回升、結果收盤價爲千二百三十元、查半日間成交統計一千八百三十五包、行情雙馬跌五十元、今有棉紗五白五十七件、運往香港、茲將各帮口買去之額量、分列如左、</p>
<p>雲南三三〇　香港　九〇五</p>
<p>同行五六〇　統計一、八三五</p>
<p>本棉交易特稀、又值　尾、生意更清、僅同業成交兩筆、奥姆拉花二百零五元一百件、及拉花二百零六元一百件、均係棧交云、</p>
<p>外棉市價、紐約棉市、晨初即呈市況活躍之狀、後又因大衆之買進、及一部份之空頭抵補、結果收盤市價、較之上日漲起三十餘磅音、印度巾况殊屬平平、昨日連同預測無甚軒輊、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易，較爲活躍、惟若干廠商、同業間交易寥寥、天津帮購　甚濃、但因銀根較緊、故祇能袖手旁觀、但大衆意見、月底渡過後、銀根有轉鬆之可能、屆時天津帮轉活躍矣、茲將昨日棉市、以美匯五元半、折合期貨送廠價如下、</p>
<h3>疋頭　布市虛弱　買戶躊躇</h3>
<p>布市因本月浮多期貨了結關係、售盤　趨下游、貨戶索價參差頗巨、呈混亂狀態、市氣虛怯、購戶躊躇不前、成交不旺、細布、細斜、粗布。每疋續跌二角半至五角、漂染布跌五角之譜、本街同業成交二百餘件、門市店及客幫銷路一致淸淡、蓋以貨價連貶、暫採觀望狀態、免遭損失、故僅添辦零星急需之貨、二十六日有疋頭三百件運往香港、</p>
<p>東布先跌後漲、蓋晨開之　、因本月份期貨新訂二十七日交割、昨係最後一天、多頭忍痛斬出、跌風續厲、十二磅龍頭細布一度降至三十七元二角半、四君子元嗶嘰跌進一元大關、最低盤做渦每碼九角九分牛、嗣以外匯平穩、現金堅定秦皇島幫及津帮進胃殊健、本街同業心思向昂、市勢乃漸趨穩定、喊價步緊、後市龍頭細布　業交易開三十九元五角、嗶嘰一元零三四分、</p>
<h3>證劵　內債市面寂</h3>
<p>證券嗜盤昨日市况、可謂堅定、上午約做二十餘萬交易、午後成交祗六萬、寥寥可數、一種閒散狀態、幾無市面可言、環境重大變化、尙在醞釀、而金子及外匯均有極度沉悶之象、惟暴變之期、當不在遠、未可忽視、昨日午前交易、同裕代四號賣出甲種、爲大通收進、胡鶴記代中一賣出乙種、爲震康買去、餘則零星交易、忽進忽出而已、午後異常岑寂、祗天生收二萬戊種七號收二萬五十丙種、餘則散一有一萬五千交易、市價則午後爲堅、結果乙種無上落、餘則一致略堅一二角、成交總數、約爲三十萬元左右、茲列簡明表於後、</p>

<h3>工部局採必要措施　租界治安決無　肅清罪惡加強防務並進　英美駐軍實行密切合作</h3>
<p>目前歐戰局勢、雖極緊張、而對此國際市塲之上海、業由各國駐滬防軍當局、懇切表　持現狀之决心、故上海局勢、當不致有何變更、惟因時局緊張關係、對租界內之治安　、各關係方面、無不注視、故英美等國駐滬防軍除盡力協助租界當局外、工部局方面　定從速增强萬國商團實力、充實租界防務、此外、局方會於本月十五日舉行　寥會　會時、提出通盤討論、一面呈報　　、一面　力設法改善現狀、以維持治安、微聞領　方面皆認爲犯罪案件之增多、皆由於「歹土」之存在、故擬　最大努力、設法將「歹土」內之　密團體、驅逐出境、惟據記者探悉、此事進行、並不順利以日領三浦義秋、獨具見解也茲將各情分述如次、</p>
<p>肅清歹土罪惡　日領三浦　別有用心</p>
<p>據外人方面消息、日本駐滬總理事三浦義秋所持反對之理由、共分兩端、（一）領事團干涉越界區域各項活動、乃係越軌行動、（二）在驅逐秘密團體出境一舉以外、尙非無更有效方法可循、至三浦所謂之「更有效方法、」則即係指在越界築路區域迅速組成堅强有力之「特警」、三浦認爲現代犯罪事件、以警務人員追踵於不法人物之後、時時加以監視、已足以减少發生案件之次數、故渠已數次建議「特警」之組織、實已刻不容緩、以此項組織、必較越界築路區域現有警務機關、更爲得力、</p>
<p>迭次交涉　均無結果</p>
<p>又據中立方面之報告、自越界築路「警務協定」簽訂以來、日方不願放棄其所徵之賭稅、實爲「特警」　　未能實現之大癥結、蓋日人於最後可作決定時、輒從中作梗、且工部局總巡鮑恩自向僞「警察局」長盧英提出「最後建議」後、迄今尙未接獲偽方之答覆、故領事團要求日領三浦協助、將滬西特務人員驅逐出境、在上月中領事團方面曾遣派代表數度前往日本特務機關從事交涉、但均無結果、</p>
<p>所有賭窟　下月根絕</p>
<p>據昨晨所得可靠消息、目前滬西仍在繼續營業之睹窟十一家、在六月初旬將一律被封閉、據稱、權威方面在過去二月中、會數度勒令賭窟停閉、但始終未見實現、今賭窟之所以又將對閉者、蓋因下月中越界築路區「特警」可望組織成立也、在上月中、滬西賭窟共有十四家、本月初旬、三家宣吿停業、故目前存在之賭窟僅有十一家、</p>
<p>加強商團實力　各國防軍　相與合作</p>
<p>公共租界目情形仍逈異平時、公共租界所有乙區、丙區、丁區等邊境、由各國駐滬防軍担任防務駐守處、所有甲區沿黃浦灘碼頭一帶、則由萬國商團之白俄團員、經常駐防該團除事爲幫同警務處維持界內治安外、幷隨時應英美等各國駐滬防軍司令之請予以協助、是以該團與各國防軍及工部局警務處、實行密切合作、</p>
<p>英隊缺額　亟待擴充</p>
<p>萬國商團中之英國隊、仍有缺額、截至最近止、Ａ隊僅八十人、Ｂ隊一百人、馬隊的七十人、鐵甲車隊九十人、工程隊五十人、防空隊六十人、蘇格蘭隊七十人、均感不足、空額頗多、是以亟待擴充、惟英總領署於本月二十日發出通知、勸吿其僑民參加萬國商團之後、已有英僑多人前往參加、惟參加之人數、尙未能補足缺額、</p>
<p>挪瑞僑民　踴躍參加</p>
<p>至於猶太隊則增加甚速、　猶太難民之大批來滬、加入萬國商團者、頗不乏人、該隊問來亦頗有缺額、最近已增至一百十五名、較原定名額僅差五名、尙有Ｃ隊原本祗剩二十餘名、近自歐戰爆發後、北歐國家如挪威、瑞典、等國僑民、加入該隊者、極爲踴躍、現已激增四十名、計達六十人左右、此外白俄雇用團丁、最近亦已補充足額、共達三百六十名矣、</p>
<p>軍實充足　設備完善</p>
<p>美國大隊之缺乏、據最近所知、美國步兵的八十人、馬隊的七十人、機關檢隊的六十人、菲律賓隊的八十名、空額之多、爲各隊之冠、中華隊步兵隊爲一百六十人、翻譯隊爲一百二十人、均完全足額、至於商團軍實方面、極爲充實、如鐵甲車之改善、魯意斯機搶管之更換新管、一切軍需設備、亦甚滿意、惟服裝則因經費關係、一時尙難大批添製、</p>
<h3>租界內各絲廠　停工　春繭上市　已遭統制</h3>
<p>上海租界區域各繅絲廠、因設行收繭運滬、已爲「華中公司」所統制、於是全體二十餘家、包括外商在內、今年一律停設行收繭、同時因原科缺乏、相繼停車殆盡、原擬春繭上市後開車計劃、今則已無法　行、探悉、淪陷區域杭州等地春繭已登塲、惟「華中公司」壟斷一切、抑低價格强迫收買、蠶農迫於環境、忍痛售給「華中公司」之繭行、聞繭價土種每百斤自一百六十元至二百元、若以絲價計算、當在二百五十元以上、並聞沿錢塘江一帶之蠶農、因浙東之繭價、較「華中公司」爲高、均設法運往銷售</p>
<h3>美陸戰隊撤退消息　日方承認錯誤　貝克上校前日正式否認　駐平津美軍亦未撤離</h3>
<p>字林西報云、日海軍發言人昨（二十四日）日答覆某外籍新聞記者稱、報紙所傳駐滬美海軍陸戰隊將撤退事、渠並無所知、惟渠已接此訊有若干錯誤之通知云、按</p>
<p>此訊刊載</p>
<p>星期五日日文「上海美日新聞」之　著地位、內稱、美軍推出上海、乃馬尼刺近舉行會議時決定者、北平與天津之美陸戰隊、曾於兩年前撤退云、査日文報紙上海每日新聞、刋載此項</p>
<p>無稽謠言、業經美國麥令隊司令貝克上校、前日正式予以否認、眞相已吿大白、又日文報紙並謂天津北平所駐　海軍業已撒退之說、復屬虛構、駐滬美海軍當局、昨日亦已加以否認矣、據外交界某氏稱、吾人常能憶及美政府致日本政府之照會及美國務卿</p>
<p>赫爾宣言、早已鄭重聲明、不能承認日本在遠東之片面行動、及其維持遠東現狀之此次心、故美國決不致撤退上海之駐軍、以變更現狀、而坐令侵略者橫行無忌、</p>
<h3>國防公債　還本付息　本息一千六百餘萬　三年爲期期作廢</h3>
<p>財政部長孔祥熙佈吿云、査民國二十七年國防公債第次次還本、業於二十九年四月十九日在上海執行抽籤、計中籤號碼爲第〇三五號、第一六〇號、第二四七號、及第三六九號、共四號、凡持有此項公債、其票面號碼末三位與上列各號碼相同者、均爲此次中　債票、計萬元票八十張五千元票一百二十張、千元票五百二十張、百元票七百二十張、十元票八百張、共計國幣二百萬元、並該項公債第二期到期息票、計合國幣一千四百九十四萬元、均於二十九年四月三十日起、由各地中央銀行及其委託之銀行開始付款、其國外部份、並定由原經收銀行、轉向香港中國交通兩銀行代爲支取、該項中　債票及到期息票均自開始付款之日起、扣足三年爲期、逾期不取即行作廢、不再償付、此次中籤債粟附帶之息票、自三期起至第六十期止、共五十八張、應由持票人於取本時、一倂激還經理銀行、如有欠缺、即在應付本銀內照數扣除、特此布吿、</p>
<h3>法公董局核准　放寬沿浦馬路</h3>
<p>法租界警務處因法租界外灘碼頭林立、貨運擁擠、而路面狹小、爲維護交通便利起見、故籌劃將各馬路放寬、經將意見提呈公董局董事會審査核准、決定將新開河與小東鬥捕房間之馬路、放寬至二四、三八公尺（即八十英尺）、該項決定、於該路兩旁之房屋翻這時、隨時實行、</p>
<h3>保安第五縱隊成立　丁雲任何令　顧復生部補充砲對一營　先頭部隊業已開入黃渡</h3>
<p>第三戰區第二游擊區總指揮冷欣、於去年九月委派丁雲濤氏爲江南散部收編主任，丁氏一介書生、應命出任艱鉅、設司令部於　　、人槍充實、彈藥俱足、現已正式委爲江南保安第五縱隊司令、業於四月一日正此次宣誓就職、現已編成三團、由任天石、徐文龍。楊震。分任團長、所有部屬、年靑有爲、體　商民、頗獲當地民眾愛　、最近並由蘇省派員正式貼　、潛伏江南一帶、待命出擊、在最近將來、必有捷報、以</p>
<p>顧部實力</p>
<p>昨據黃渡友人來滬、述及遊擊隊顧復生部、自青滬路引退後、現已補充就緒、並經新四軍撥派砲隊一營、手機關槍一連、步兵大、銳不司當其先張步隊、已於前日抵達黃波、日偽軍聞風遠遁、</p>

<h3>所謂「交換工廠」　滬商絕不受　表面收回實際無改組　滬商深明大義置不理</h3>
<p>南京「組織」出現以來、期其早日實踐「經濟提協」一項起見業已組織「接受工廠委員會」、宣傳專辯日方交還所佔華商經營各工廠事宜、査滬埠華商工廠之設於楊樹浦、閘北、浦東、吳淞、及西郊各處者、自國軍撤退後、悉被佔踞、其中規模較大、</p>
<p>設備完善</p>
<p>之廠、則多經日商招工開業、此次僞府之所欲接收者、雖謂包括華北華中各淪陷區域而實則偏重滬市、故不久將在滬埠設立所謂「辦事處」、以便就近辦理各廠商之「登記」與「調査」等等工作、惟廠商方面、對於此種企圖及其眞實用意、</p>
<p>均早窺破</p>
<p>、決不受彼欺弄、　以偽方所接收、自係由日方將所佔之廠於某種條件之下、交還接收之機關、然後知照各該廠之所有人、向其「登記」、並須聽候「調査」、及至各項手續吿竣、所費或且超過全廠財產之價値、倘　實行「經濟提携」「雙方合作」、表面雖似收回、實際</p>
<p>無　改組</p>
<p>、是則匪唯違背經濟部最近告誡廠商之嚴令、　且自行斷送該廠之生命、苟非別有存心、決不希望在現時環境之下作收回之舉、於此足徵全滬被佔廠商、胥屬深明大義、初小以一己之得失、而寗甘冒不韙也、</p>
<h3>三千猶人來滬說　警務方面否認</h3>

<h3>德對荷印問題　不感無趣　日方旣感失望　復加歪曲解釋</h3>
<p>昨日英文大美晚報發表伍德海氏推測日本是否向荷蘭屬地東印度有所動作問題一文、伍氏謂、日本政府自提出維持荷印原狀後劉於德當局遲不作覆、感覺異常焦燥、結果本月廿二日德政府致覆文稱、德國對於荷印問題、不感興趣、日軍主辦之國民新聞解釋此覆文爲一空白之委任狀」、顯示德國忽略荷印將來地位之利益、但其他方面解釋德方慫慂日本放棄中立國立塲、據伍氏意見、日本是否對美國及其他各有關國家誠意守的、尙須揣測、一部份日文報紙認爲日本目下正在陷於在華戰爭之泥沼、實不宜再行冒險、同時主張從速結束在華戰事、俾得重享目由、爲所欲爲、然據現下情形而論、日本之企圖結束在華戰事、決難實現也、</p>
<h3>意郵輪奉命停航　貨輪照常行駛　每月兩艘貨物照常載運　康脫凡第搭客與否未定</h3>

<p>已接通知</p>
<p>雖未說明停航原因、但必係受歐洲戰事影響而無疑、至停航部份、祗以快班郵船爲限、該項郵船、以載客及運送郵件爲主、停駛後即停止搭客、至於貨運、原有往來意大利及遠東閒之貨船（俗名野鷄船）、此種貨船、爲數甚多、駛來中國者、平均每月至少兩艘、每輪載重亦有五千餘噸、各該輪行駛航綫、</p>
<p>並無一定</p>
<p>現貨運需要而行駛各埠、沿線小碼頭均停靠、此種意輪、現仍照常行駛、故歐洲與遠東間之貨運、仍將照常載送、快班郵船僅康脫凡第及康脫羅梭兩輪、現因奉命停航、康脫羅　輪已終止駛來遠東、康脫凡第輪准下月七日可抵滬、因該輪仍須駛返意國、將照常搭客、惟公司方面尙不能確定</p>

<p>赫德演詞</p>
<p>美國總會舉行對外貿易叙餐時、美國亞洲艦隊司令長官　德上將　席致詞、題爲「自由貿易」指陳貿易壁壘之弊、申斥武力統治之禍、盛道平等貿易之利、並表白美國海軍維護正義之態度、詞肫　至、　譯如下、</p>
<p>國際貿易</p>
<p>乃國家間保持和平與相互利益之至上方法、余謹引美國前任副國務卿賽易爾（即現任駐菲高級專員）所著書中之一節、以闡明之、賽易爾之言曰、「人民間之相倚互惠、其基礎厥在廣大與錯綜之國際貿易網、如貿易小自重重限制之壁壘中解放、而使之永恒維持自由、則各人民之生活、勢必崩裂、生活之水準，亦必被迫降落、蒙害之大、將必無從估計、時至今日、絕無任何一大工業國家、可能經濟獨立、是以經濟自給、徒爲一種倒退與阻碍文化進步之政策而一二、美國與其他國家建立</p>
<p>國際關係</p>
<p>遵行是項原理、歷有年所、按照貿易協定法案、會盡其所能以改善國際貿易、體察環境、分別訂立協定、蒙其利者、不惟爲美國本國、美國之善自爲處、乃與人共其利、我人與其他國家共獲機會均等之合法彼此公平待遇、相益互長、所惜者、今日之世界、乃與此背道而馳、事屬顯明、已無須詳爲指陳、惟余有不能已於言者、我人深知今有一種組織化之歪曲理論、方圖支配若干人民之思想與信仰、此種狀况、實屬</p>
<p>危險已極</p>
<p>而使前途幽暗顚　、武力統治之傾向、旣極强烈擴張於大地之上、自由貿易之機會、乃被擠軋而愈見狹窄、美國爲國力强大之國、其軍用力量、亦猶他種因素、並屬登峯造極、而海軍力量、日增月盛、余爲海軍之一員、深信我等決不輕用武力、如其我國必至施用其武力、則我等之作戰、亦決非爲以不公平待遇其他民族而戰爭、</p>

<h3>東方飯店寓客　王已勁昨被綁　王率來滬室逆旅　突來暴客自寓所架走</h3>
<p>虞洽　路一二〇號東方飯店三樓於昨晨八時許、突發生一綁架案、被綁者係海門人王已勁、綁匪計有三名、兩服西裝、一御長衫，挾登預置汽車、向跑馬廳路直駛而逸、茲將各情探誌於次、</p>
<p>擁妾幽居</p>
<p>王已勁者、係汀蘇海門人、年五十四歲、中等身村、蓄有短髭、在原籍海復鎭開設豐泰和糧食舖、歷有年所，半月前挈眷來滬、寓居於新東方飯店、闢三〇九號房間、至前日（二十一日）又有鄕人數名抵滬、因此不敷居住、另闢對門第三一一號房間、　妾幽居，不意昨晨八時許、突有不速之客三人馳來、兩衣西裝、一御派立司長衫、當抵三〇九號門前、高聲　叫茶房啟門、迨一侍者行來、該三人詢其該號是否王先生所開、聲勢汹汹、斯時三一一號王己動亦被驚醒、啟鬥外出探視、並語三人云、先生等詢問三〇九號由何要事、此號亦余所開、此時兩衣西裝者、遂用暴力將王擁入二一一號房間、嚴鎖其門、並破口辱駡、當時有五十三號茶房名王海林者</p>

<p>驟睹斯然、知非善類、乃即上前謂先生等如擬拘人、請先向賬房間接洽、一衣長衫者遽謂、吾輩係奉憲兵司令部命而來、探手擬出證件模樣、繼即喝令王海林他去、王遂被迫怏怏而出、迨回抵堂口、亟用電話報舌捕房、正語接綫者時、被衣長衫者一匪察覺、袖出盒子砲柄、猛擊其後頸部一下、於是王懾於淫威、隨即放下電話機、默坐堂口、</p>
<p>挾登汽車</p>
<p>移時二匪挾住王己勁由盤梯上推下、當時王穿汗衣、白印度綢袴、赤足拖草拖鞋、　中掛白嗶嘰長衫一件、此時該飯店司閽捕正在携壺外出泡茶、祇見二匪架王步出大門口、亟放置水壺、跟踪追出、見王已擁入一汽車內、向跑馬廳路疾駛向西而去、該車號碼爲八九〇六號、事後由飯店賬房間據情報吿老閘捕房、派中西幹探馳往調査一過、俾跴緝匪徒究辦、</p>

<h3>茶市</h3>
<p>今年出山之新茶，漢口及其餘各處業已開辦有日矣。其中最可危者，為第一等初出之茶。緣本年印度之茶，色更好而味更厚，即中國最　之茶，亦不能比。本館接閱英國來信，知印茶實數倍中國；而中國上好之茶，更為虧本，計茶每磅虧至四　尼至五六八辨尼不等，次者雖無如此大虧，然亦多有耗折也。至英之銷路，則尚暢旺，惟因中茶印茶，皆嫌太多，人皆求售，而未售者不敵求售之多，故茶價須買客自定，西人之虧本者，昌繁有徒。加以本年六月期之匯票，改為三月，而各銀行又知茶商虧本者多，故必令銀數少匯，如去年一萬銀價之茶，可匯九千兩，今或七千五百兩，或八千兩矣。故本銀又須加添，恐斷無人爭先恐後以買茶矣；竊願內地之中國人，普知。惟本年匯票價，可冀再賤，此是妙處，緣金日貴而銀日賤也。即以目前論，商人六個月期票，每一兩銀價四先令十一辨尼半，銀行現票，則每銀一兩價四先令九辨尼八八五。</p>

<h3>我懼怕誰呢　（續）</h3>
<p>帮助人克服懼怕的方法不一，如對人貢獻好的，清楚的，誠懇的忠告，使他明白前途是寶貴的，便可以帮助他勝過懼怕，此外，他個人有自制力，和訓練自己的工夫，也可得益不少。一個人能指揮自己的精神，比一個奪得大城的人，還要偉大。因為我們最壞的仇敵，就是自己，懼怕自己，在許多的懼怕中，佔第一位。自制，好比是一扇逃避懼怕的門，一個人若能把握住自己，控制自己的衝動，天天啓發自己的意志力，他卽走向克服懼怕的道路了。但卽或做到如此地步，我們對於這懼怕的問題，還不算得着了最後的解決。人生尅制懼怕的最可靠方法，當是他的宗教。可惜，人們把懼怕放在宗教一起，威嚇人行善，如懼怕的基礎上，萬萬不能有真正的宗教。生命是一種偉大的冒險，生命能使我們得着什麽，無人能知道。在人生道上，總是有疑雲的，但無須懼怕，懼怕只能减弱我們的精神，拖我們向下，我們要用正義，勇敢，愛心，真理，和德備克服懼怕。一個人努力過清潔的生活，而用這樣一種的信心作背景，就是上帝要從我們平庸的人裏面，造就出光榮的奇蹟來，這個人便是得勝者，他永不懼怕死亡，死亡在他看來，只是一扇進到較精美，較偉大，較充實的生命—偉大冒險的繼續—的門。我們在上帝，在前面吹起號筒，只要我們前進，不要我們後退。真理和愛心，是制服懼怕的萬應膏，也是宗教無價的遺產。「主是我的光明和拯救，我懼怕誰呢？主是我生命的力量，我畏懼誰呢？」（完）</p>

<h3>怎樣立志做大事</h3>
<p>— 嚴懋德</p>
<p>我們應該注意，不要認為做大事就是做大官，那是絕對的錯誤，做官是為民衆服務，不過是事業之一，然而所謂大事，就是說：「無論做一件事，要有始有終，澈底的做，成功者即是大事。」這裏我且舉一個例子來說：從前美國大總統林肯，幼年的時候，家境非常貧困，飯也吃不飽，讀書當然是沒有機會，但是他有偉大的創造的精神，他有為社會國家盡力的志向。他在十六歲時，很不贊成奴隸制度，及後苦學力行，終於達到了他的目的，終於做到了美國的大總統。林肯這樣堅苦卓絕的精神，便成了大事，所以林肯在歷史上是永垂不朽的。</p>
<p>於此，根據了偉大成功的教訓，要做大事，一定要具備下列二項條件：</p>
<p>一·立定志向：所謂志，就是一生做事的目標，有了目標，以後應當始終堅持，以求貫徹，決不可因貧窮而失志，因富貴而驕傲。</p>
<p>二·應具有不屈不撓的精神，和再接再厲的勇氣及始終如一的毅力，以求事業的成功。</p>
<p>親愛的小朋友們！你們是民族的蓓蕾，是國家的新苗，是人類的源泉，因此希望你們在幼年的時候，就應當立定志向，效法林肯苦幹的精神，將來自然可以做大事，成大人物。</p>
<h3>紀念徐錫麟先烈</h3>
<p>— 陸利時</p>
<p>小朋友，今天是五月二十六日，大家都不認為今天是一個紀念日，這一椿革命的偉舉誰都會忽視了的，但是我們不能忘掉革命史上有一位徐錫麟先烈，他是一位革命實行家，他在今天幹的一件烈烈轟轟的事情，足以照耀千古，標榜萬世，現在，我就來把這件事介紹給小朋友們！</p>
<p>徐先生名錫鱗，號伯蓀，浙江紹興人，他小時就富有革命思想，他認為革命不應該講空話，要實地去做，當他做了安徽陸軍小學總辦兼任巡警學堂會辦時就聯絡許多革命同志，謀在安徽起事。</p>
<p>那時候安徽的巡撫叫恩銘，一天忽把他（徐先烈）召去談話，說：「前天兩江總督捉到一個姓葉的革命黨，供出有許多黨人在安徽密謀起事，有個徐某也在內，你去偵查一下」。徐先烈一聽徐某，就知事情已經洩露了，不如先發制人，他當時表面上滿口答應去偵查，暗中却打算早些發動。</p>
<p>民國五年的五月二十六日巡警學堂將辦畢業了，巡撫恩銘要親臨主考閱操的，徐先烈認為大好機會來了，正在大禮堂行禮的時候，徐先烈忽然跑到恩銘面前道：「今天革命軍起事了！」恩銘大驚問道：「你怎麼得知」？話還未完，徐先烈已把炸彈擲在地上，彈未爆炸，忙從腰間拔出兩枝手槍，對準恩銘開放，恩銘遂即倒地而死，這時各官員都嚇得四散逃逸。</p>
<p>當天晚上，徐先烈被捕了！官對徐先烈說：「你為什麽謀刺恩銘？你知道犯罪嗎？明天要把你的心肝剖開，看你還兇不兇」，徐先烈大笑道：「我的刺恩銘，是求達到革命的目的，現在目的已達，就是割我身為千萬片，我也情願，區區心肝，何足顧惜！」</p>
<p>第二天，徐先烈果然慘遭剖心而死。</p>
<h3>時疫病</h3>
<p>— 余箴</p>
<p>春季一霎眼快將逝去，這幾天已是春末夏初了。街道的木桿上，商店的橱窗上，都黏着一張張觸目的傳單，這是工部局衛生處警告市民快快預防虎烈拉，傷寒，瘧疾等時疫病。的確，這幾天因氣候的寒暖，蒼蠅已開始活動了，在繁殖它們的種族，却影響到人體的康健，因為蒼蠅是傳染疾病的健將。這種傳單就是阿慧到學的那一條路上，也可發見。</p>
<p>阿慧在路上，見到了一張「預防虎烈拉」的傳單，却使他莫明其妙了，「虎烈拉是時疫病，俗稱霍亂吐瀉，這是一種很危險的疾病。要是患了這病，趕快去請醫生診治否則便有死亡的危險。」</p>
<p>「那麼它是怎樣傳染的呢？為什麽要生這種病？有沒有預防的方法嗎？」阿慧心急地問了這二個問題。</p>
<p>「凡病原菌寄生我們身體中，它能分泌一種毒素，破壞身體中的組織，使身體的正常作用受到了阻碍，於是就生疾病。虎烈拉就是一種霍亂病菌，在自來水，牛乳等都有它們的蹤跡，經過了蒼蠅蚊蟲的媒介，而侵入我們的身體。預防法當然是有的，而且很多，真是舉不勝舉，簡單的方法：（一）消極的，不要喝沒有煮沸的生水和沒有濾過的冷水，不要吃蒼蠅釘過或過夜的食物，以及各種不清潔的東西。（二）積極的：打防疫針，撲滅蒼蠅蚊蟲，一切食物須好好貯藏，使房屋中乾燥和晒日光，這些都是容易而做得到的方法」（未完）</p>

<h3>秀蘭鄧波兒自傳　（四）</h3>
<p>— 民</p>
<p>我是常常喜歡跳舞的·媽媽曾經這麽說，我想伊的話一定不錯，因為伊知道我的一切，比什麽人都明白呢。我曾聽得伊說過我剛會學步走路的時期，就喜歡跳舞了。據媽媽說，我當初走路時，和別的小孩子們不同，脚步兒飄飄然，好像一個小天使呢。每逢伊在我們的屋子裏開無綫電時，我一聽得了音樂之聲，就跳出最美妙的步子來。</p>
<p>可甘，我來告知你一個秘密。有好些時候，媽媽並沒有開無綫電而由我自己開的。我在起居室中旋來旋去的舞着，而創造出新的步子來。後來我在攝影場中，由傑先社那許先生教我跳舞的步子，在我所主演的各部影片中，給我不少的幫助。你可還記得那位在「小將軍」，一片中和我合跳梯級舞的威廉　賓生失生麽？他說我將來年紀大起來，就能創造我自己的新步子，好像其他良好的跳舞名家一般。</p>
<p>有一夜，爹爹在替我洗澡，那時候我只三歲，而如今到了六歲，仍是爹爹替我洗澡的，媽媽開始對我說，不如送我上跳舞學校去，倒是一件挺好的事。鄰近的小孩子們，原有幾個都是上跳舞學校去學舞的，我記得媽媽對爸爸說：「喬治，一禮拜只有一小時，學費只須五角錢好了。」</p>
<p>爸爸的模樣兒不大高興，他說我的年紀太小，不配上跳舞學校去，並且他們的意思，也不願我做一個跳舞家。他說他的家庭裏，和媽媽的家庭裏，從來沒有一個上過舞臺和銀幕的，在他看來，學會了舞，也和我們一家沒有什麽利益的。</p>
<p>媽媽微笑着，和爹爹辯論了一番，終於得了最後的勝利。第二天早上，就帶着我上跳舞學校去了。學校的所在，雖　我們家不遠。我穿上了最好的衣服，十分美麗。但我們到了那邊，那教師却提出了抗議，說下次來時，不可如此，只要穿着一身樸實的衣服，原來校中別的女孩子們所穿衣服，都很樸實，不男孩子們也只穿着普通的小衫子罷了。媽媽和別家的媽媽們坐在靠牆的長凳上，看我們學舞。教師命我們排成了一行，做一種微跳的步子，我們也就跟着伊跳，先用這一隻脚，後用那一隻脚，另有人在鋼琴上彈着一支「下溯蘇黃河」的曲兒。</p>
<p>可甘，那時我的脚步是何等的亂啊！幸而你不在那裏，要是給你瞧見了，定要羞我的。然而我常能照着我自己的意思舞　我的脚，我要怎樣就是怎樣。你看我在銀幕上跳那種很簡單的步子，其實我曾下過幾小時的苦功了。任是「起立歡呼」和「嬰兒鞠躬」兩片中的舞步，似乎再簡單也沒有了，然而初學的時候，非常艱難，但我總是用心去學，學會之後，我即使不需用這種步子時，却也不會忘懷。我在攝影場上每次遇到了傑密鄧恩，我總得先和他跳一下，我們以前在「嬰兒鞠躬」片中合作的小舞，然後再同他握手招呼。可是我初學這種小舞時，還只四歲半，去今已有兩年了，我却依舊不曾忘懷。</p>

<p>本年度的紐約世界博覽會中，正和去年一樣，所有各種游藝，都設法羅致，應有盡有。而且有許多塲合和節目，是與去年不同的；因此，還是有向讀者介紹一下的必要。</p>
<p>在一九四〇年的紐約世界博覽會會塲中，凡是舞台劇，電影，舞蹈，歌唱，雜要，無綫電影，無綫電廣播等，什麽都有，而且各個游藝班子，十九是在百老滙聞名，演出早已相當成功的。</p>
<p>各種游藝裹面特別可使我們提出的是一所規模宏大的音樂館完全新造起來。自二月十五日開工，到五月十一日正式開幕，各種建築工程經過三個月的時間才完成的。</p>
<p>此大音樂館由東而西，自東面近日光谷地方起，到西面噴水池沿岸的旱船室爲止，內部非常寬大，足容七千觀衆，入座券相當低廉，每人祇美金四角。</p>
<p>這個規模宏大的音樂館，唯一目的，在介紹美國歷史上的樂劇，歌劇，以及喜劇等。因爲近年來美國的觀衆，對於歌舞，興趣相當濃厚，由於古典樂劇的上演已使甚多觀衆，對於美國舞台史的發展有着深切的認識。</p>
<p>大音樂館自十一日開幕而後，所有歌唱節目，由樂劇，舞台，與電台明星擔任。另外有一百個歌唱家參加，還有一個唱歌班，包括一百個歌舞明星和男女獨唱者。而且有二百六十九個天才兒童，組成一個兒童樂園加入表演。人才這樣衆多，節目自然比去年更精彩哩！</p>
<h3>行都得劇潮（中）</h3>
<p>— 瑩</p>
<p>「國家至上」</p>
<p>曾以「殘霧」出名的新劇作家老舍先生自從前綫慰勞歸來，即與返渝之筆部隊隊員宋之的光生合作，替中國回敎救國協會的中國萬歲劇團編新劇，劇名爲「國家至上」，這劇本是以目前時代爲背景，襯　回漢二族和回族自己家里的情形，由於侵略者臨降，大家在民族至上國家至上的前提下，起來共同奮鬭了。</p>
<p>這劇本在宋、舒二先生生花的筆下，加之名導演馬彥祥的善導，它的演出，更得了全市觀衆的好評，大的激起共鳴，一時轟動人心。</p>
<p>在四月二十三號，軍事委員會爲了招待南洋華僑回國慰勞團。是日在國泰大戲院也重請萬歲劇團再表演一次，當時有許多要人及高貴的仕女都一汽車汽車的駛到國泰，大飽他們的眼福，情况之熱鬧，至爲空前。</p>
<h3>「從軍樂」新型化</h3>
<p>接着轟動全市的「國家至上」後，有一個用新手法寫出的新劇本，父以新的演劇技術演出的「從軍樂」出現在國泰大戲院。</p>
<p>這劇本在各方面是相當平淡的，然而在「戲是綜合的藝術」這個原則下，編者將歌，舞，樂三方面融合成了一個整體，幷且更在導演的靈敏手腕下，把佈景，燈光，以及在劇塲裏看得見，聽得見，感覺得釗的一切，都能打成一片，使臺上和臺下在感覺上一致起來，這是很難能可貴的收穫。</p>
<p>無論那一個觀衆看後，劇中那家庭，朋友，鄕隣—起踴躍投軍的歡樂，一定不會忘記的，同時，甚至更能盡了推動兵役的任務，達到劇本的最後目的。</p>
<p>這劇本共演四天，自四月十一號到四月十四日才停演，編劇者是余上沅，王思曾二人，導演是揚村彬，演員是國立劇校的學生。</p>

<h3>義國參戰與近東風雲　地中海上的腥風血雨　將隨西綫緊張而俱來</h3>
<p>— 影呆</p>
<p>義國的戰綫　地中海風雲正一天緊張一天，大多數的觀察家，都得到一個印象，就是義國一旦加入作戰，將應付三條戰綫。第一條，在歐非兩洲和法國作戰。第二條，在巴爾幹半島。第三條，在近東，待德義軍隊侵入南斯拉夫之後，更許就在侵入南斯拉夫時，義國將開始向近東進攻。根據德義兩國所發表的意見，在近東的戰事，很容易獲到勝利的。軸心國以爲聯軍在近東實力是非常薄弱，而近東的秘密工作，却在四年前才開始進行。</p>
<p>近東德　惑</p>
<p>在過去四年中，反英與反法宣傳，早已在消極的進行，書籍，小冊子，報紙的由德義兩國寄出，分給無數的阿刺　人。義國巴里地方的無綫軍臺，是反英宜傳的中心，每星期播送反英演講五次。一九三六年，巴力斯坦發生叛亂與一九三九年九月底發生內戰時，德義兩國會把大量軍火運往巴力期坦，關於與叛車相勾結，德國當局雖極力否認，而造作相反的事實，但現在却已承認了。一九四〇年，德國出版一部有一百頁的册子，分送給萬十歐洲，美洲，亞洲和澳州的人士，書名「英國在巴力斯坦的暴虐政治」。</p>
<p>油濃淤血</p>
<p>這種活動很明顯的在準備應付未來的一次戰事，而使若干阿刺伯領袖，和第三德國接近的工作，甚至歐洲發生戰事而後，還在進行。因爲就是歐戰爆發以後，許多住在叙里亞，巴力斯坦，和埃及的中立國人，還在從事這種拉攏的工作。這樣在納粹黨定希望近東一有戰事，英法聯軍將　遇甚多的困難，一九三八年秋天，德國統制的報紙，發表項來自耶路撒冷的新聞。「所謂英國的軍隊，竟小能抑平幾千阿刺伯的叛軍，這樣個國家，怎能以戰爭來威脅我們！」這消息的全部是證實阿刺伯人的怎樣聰明，和英國人的怎樣羞恥。「在這些曠野的邦國之中，英國將需用幾萬的軍隊來控制叛民。」作者在末了父加上幾句，這樣就可使人看出萬一要應付眞正的戰事，是多麼困難。領土中有很好的準備，而近東各國又到處有德義間諜的活動。義國或許會想對於過去四年的耕耘，有所收穫。希望阿刺伯人叛變和怠工。阿刺伯人在第一次歐戰中，就知道這件事情，而明白到依照名將勞倫斯叙述，是聰明的學生，在他們最近的叛變中，已證明「沙漠中的勞倫斯」是確實的。義國除開想控制歐亞交通樞紐的蘇彝士運河以外，在經濟和軍事方面，最重要的就是把伊拉克和海發及叙里亞的油池聯接起來。當阿刺伯人叛變時，對於這些油池的聯接，曾破壞過二十多次。義國將會如法泡製，因爲統制了這邦國之後，修復是很便　的。</p>
<p>夾縫中的近東各國</p>
<p>假如義國在叙里亞和巴力斯坦兩地能够勝利，將會處置伊拉克的油池，而向英法進攻，並控制蘇彝士運河，更會危及土耳其，在幾天之中，可佔據英屬塞普洛斯島。對於近東各國早已準備好秘密工作。根據希特勒對於任何未米戰爭的預料，義國的野心，是在造成她近東的主人翁的地位。在這些驚人的目標和目前的情形中，有着兩大障礙，就是聯軍的陸軍和英國的海軍，義國如果對於英法近東的軍隊實力，佔計得太低，而對於阿刺伯的叛　估計得太高，那是危險的。聯軍的情形，完全和一九一八年的土耳其軍隊不同，那時土國早已軟弱無能，一視阿刺伯人願望的好壞而定決策。近東的軍隊，是一支新軍，那是很危險的。而義國也沒有勞倫斯那樣人物，可以造成叛亂，即使能够達到煽動叛　的目的，阿刺伯人的所以要叛變，目的在求取自由，獨立，他們大槪不會想爲了脫離英法，改由義國統治而作戰吧？</p>
<h3>世界婦女　戰時的　法國婦女</h3>
<p>法國的婦女在戰時並不穿着制服，可是她們却較之些他各國的婦女史直接地受到戰爭的影響。法國有五白萬名男子在軍隊中服務，因此後力的許多工作就需要婦女來大部份地完成牠了，尤其在農業這方面，這情形更加　得眞實；因爲現在也正如上次大戰一樣最大　份的兵士是由法國農邨所供給的。雖則農業是法國的最大事業，然而並沒有一部份是計算在保存事業中的。兵士們大規模地在農業上吿假從軍，可是就祇在這年的某一個時期內，全法國鉅大的農業機具都交託在婦女，老人和幼童的手中了。</p>
<p>法國的農邨婦女本來」直就是一個艱苦的勞動者，而她現在是須兩倍的動勞了，她底工作日數也更加長久了。像放牛去食草這一類簡單的工作現在則常山休養在家巳好久了的老婆子來擔任了。撇開錢的問題，在法國的農婦中現常有一種强烈的動機；她們要以最大的努力「處事優良，她們要使男人們在返鄉時不感到任何一點失望。</p>
<p>但是，不論農婦們工作的怎樣勤快，這依舊是一個嚴重的問題呢，此法國政府現正竭盡所能地以使農業生產維待在一甚高的水平上。在上次大戰中，麥的生產量曾在一九一三至一九一七間銳减至一半以上，這種情形現在是必須要避免掉的。假使戰爭持久下去的話，那麽口糧之於農業生產是會發生一影響的。</p>
<p>在上次戰爭中法國曾在其戰爭工業中雇用了四十萬婦女，但據測此次戰爭中這數字將更高漲。飛機工業幾乎雇用了很大部份的婦女。</p>
<p>在法國的一切像製衣，皮工，珠寳及其他的繡貨等奢侈工業中婦女也是人規模地雇用着的。這些貿易商人的繁榮大多依靠國外市塲，而且在封鎖德國貨輸出的實施中，許多外國市塲尤其是南北　洲是很有希望，會成爲接受法國貨物的新門戶的。可是一方面由於法國人民對奢侈品大大地在消費减少，一方面串實上又不受到政府的鼓勵，加之戰時旅行者之絕跡，因此沒有一家奢侈品商人能像承平時代那樣營業了</p>
<p>在戰爭開始時的緊張漸漸過去後，巴黎的製衣廠立刻又復業了，巴黎的模特兒也如以前一樣的跑出來了，可是即巴黎最大的製衣廠現在也僅雇用牠們以前在承平時代時的五分之一的職員。那麽其他那些技藝高超的工人怎樣才能被雇呢？勞工部長曾想到一個解決方法而現在也已付諸實施的，那就是爲一萬個製衣女工開設許多處軍衣工廠雇用牠們來縫製制服，戎裝。</p>

<h3>馬塞斯密特戰機</h3>
<p>— 茜</p>
<p>—德國空軍的靈魂—</p>
<p>據最近電訊所傳，今祥德國將以空軍爲進攻主幹，實施集團空襲；而英法當局也屢次警吿軍人和人民，隨時提防空襲；是則德國所恃者是她的優越的空軍，而德國空軍所驕傲於世者便是「馬塞斯密特」（Messer　Schmitts）戰鬭機。我們常常在報紙上，看見各國通訊社都提及這種飛機，究竟這種飛機是怎樣的呢？</p>
<p>這種飛機是以其製作人威里，馬塞斯密特的名字取名。馬氏今年才四十一歲，比美國著名飛機製造家道格拉斯還年輕，鼻子尖尖，髮作金黃色，生於德國奥格斯堡，他的故鄕是一個恬靜的帶有中古風味的城市。他十五歲時，即學習飛行。</p>
<p>當英機和德機在海里哥蘭灣上空發生第一次大空戰時，才發現馬塞斯密特的Me．110新機，道和Me．190大不相同，有鄧拉彭斯發動機兩具，可坐飛行員二三人，所裝設的武器相當重，兩翼間裝有機關槍四挺，小型榴彈砲兩尊，速率比Me．190更快，的每小時快二十哩。關於飛機上裝置榴彈砲的功效如何，尙待試騐。</p>
<p>但大體　之，它的中彈距離勝過機關槍，單單一發彈就足以致敵人於死命。但是在長距離中，榴彈砲的成功希望却不大，且因爲飛機要裝置這種重量的榴彈砲，其他的武器便要减少。這種Me．110馬塞斯密　戰鬭機的效力如何，仍須待將來交戰的結果來證實。</p>
<h3>降落傘小史</h3>
<p>— 菊塵</p>
<p>在十九世紀末英國對菲洲的波蘭人戰爭時，德國報紙曾建議用降落傘携帶來福槍手落地，掃射敵人之步兵，據謂勝利可操左券。此項意見，雖不重視，但其時用降落傘跳躍，已非完全幻想　。降落傘之原理，早爲東方人明瞭，十七世紀時，有位法人旅行暹羅，會描寫其土人之賣藝者，手持大傘各一柄，由塔頂飄然而下。</p>
<p>降落傘第一次應用，爲十八世紀巴黎二位著名航空家，名爲勃蘭却及加納林者，彼二人互相競技。在一七九七年時，勃蘭却以氣球昇空，打破紀錄，加納林思有以過之。在一七九七年十月一十二日加氏用降落傘在派克蒙沙地方，二千二百三十六英尺上空，手執旗幟，飛舞而下，觀衆承認加氏之技在勃之上。但降落傘之跳落，並不能單作遊藝觀也。</p>
<p>一八零八年波蘭航空家從失火之氣球中，用降落傘逃出，此爲其第一次實用。一九一二年柏萊大佐在蒙脫那表演其第一次由飛機中用降落傘跳下。在一九二四年時，降落傘已成爲飛機設備中之主要物。張開降落傘最低之高度爲一百五十英尺。跳下處之最高者，現有之紀錄爲二萬五千英尺。</p>
<p>此次歐戰，德國降落傘隊大顯神通，隊員在極高處由飛機中跳出，到將近地面時，才張開其降落傘，吾則在半空中飄飄欲仙，不但不能作戰，而父爲敵人槍彈之目標　。</p>

<h3>連縣山的婚禮</h3>
<p>— 忠一</p>
<p>唱歌求偶生活不脫原始狀況　頭押　毛宛如　邦狠主服飾</p>
<p>湘桂交界的速縣，離城七十里，即爲猺民聚居的地方，筆者抵達那地方的時候，爲廢歷十月十六日，正是猺民求偶結婚的日子，其結婚的過程，頗爲有趣。淸晨，羣集於廣塲中，先由男子引吭高歌，所唱者均爲自誇家世之歌。「咱有良田二百畝，牛羊雞鴨無其數，如果有中意咱的好親親呀！你到咱屋卡（即家中之意）來住，總使你獲福無窮，如登仙境呀！」其聲極爲洪亮，猶似歐人所唱者，若其中一女子對該男子合意者，即可自由上前，先將手中所持之毛巾拋向該男子肩頭，和聲而唱，嗣即按手並肩，情話綿綿，入晚始結婚。其婚禮頗簡，猺民身强力大，忠實勇敢，惜無智識，生活情狀，與中古時代無異，而服裝尤爲奇特，髮結盤頂，頭戴高笠，袒胸。男長袴，綁總，女則短袴，均身佩刀劍，手持長矛，跳躍以前，樣子很爲英武。村長都是老年人，且頭揷雉毛，如京戲中飾番邦人狼主的角色差不多。眞可謂中國之大，無奇不有！</p>

<h3>電台何以可擾亂</h3>
<p>— 菊塵</p>
<p>近來接收上海福音廣播電台發見呼呼之聲，將該台播音完全籠罩，這就是報上屢次所載某方的騷擾，在外埠看不到上海報的，或許會疑心自己收音機出毛病。作者每日收聽該台英文新聞報吿及佈道，幾乎成癖，自此項情形發生以後，祗好關上不聽，因爲在收音者方面，別的騷擾，還可以裝置濾波器　設法免避，但此項騷擾，則一無辦法。</p>
<p>原來電台都有其各自之波長，或週率。譬如一根繩子一　繫於門上，一端執在手中，手若上下揮動，繩則向上下灣曲成波浪形，前浪之頂與後浪之頂的距離，就是波畏；浪形之一起一伏即四一週，週率是每秒鍊的週數，千週率即以千爲單位。依照國際無綫電公約，同一地方，不能有二個同樣波長的廣播台的。（大意如此）吾則，二家的播音，就同時入耳，互相混擾了。現在福音電台的波長爲3571，　達，今有某方以同樣波長，發送電波，但無音樂語言負　其上，（無移電學上四調幅）於是成了呼呼之聲了。</p>

<h3>國際價格問題平議</h3>
<p>— 白明</p>
<p>這幾天的報紙上，每天都可以看到一些大衆的呼聲，那就是爲了物價問題而發生的。當五月二日外匯發生空前緊縮的時候，未轉瞬間，市塲上的貨價，即藉口於外匯緊縮，高漲二成至三成不等，現在外匯放長，論理物價即應該下跌，而漲上去的物價，依然如故，並沒有减低，於是一些感受物價高漲威脅的人們，爲了有切膚之痛，發表一些不平的呼聲，這是人情之常，我們是應該寄予同情的。其他物價的漲落，姑且不談，本刊爲國貨專刊，請一談國貨的價格問題。</p>
<p>關於國貨的漲價問題，記者已於上期談過，現在外匯放長，爲甚麼依然只漲不落呢？抱着這一種觀念的，在目前的社會中是不乏其人，甚至有人更痛駡國貨廠商的乘機操蹤牟利，固然乘機操縱物價以圖牟利者，我不能說絕對的沒有，但國貨售價之不能驟然降落，亦有其不能降落之因素在。爲甚麽呢？我們先要知道戰時國貨的漲價，乃勢所必然，米價較戰前高漲四九倍，煤價較戰前高漲七八借，而國貨漲價之比率，較米煤相差遠甚，匯率緊縮，物價高漲，從事國貨產銷事業者，已感於寗願存積原料或貨品，較之於製造成品或銷售之獲利爲多，此共一。貨價迫於現實之情勢而高漲，但跌價時須計算其成本，過去因成本高於售價，貨價旣未漲足，則外匯雖長，成本仍高，故跌價亦未能如響斯應，此其二。戰時因交通不便，物質缺乏，任何物價，均有高漲之可能，不僅國貨爲然，此其三。就目前市塲情形說，物價高漲，即幣値降低，擁有資金者寗願存貨叩不願　款，製造商寗願存積原料而不願從事生產，販賣商寗願存貨　積而不願銷售一空，此種特殊情勢下之變熊心理，亦爲貨價不能跌落之一因。尤有進者，外匯之緊縮愈甚，則原料之外流亦愈甚，原料之外流愈甚，則原料之售價愈高，加以動力人工之成本，亦因物價之高漲而隨高，外匯雖長，而反應於物價者則甚微，此亦爲國貨不能隨外匯之放鬆而跌價的理由。以上所述，是理山，也是事實。然則我們既然元許國貨廠商因外匯緊縮而漲價，難道外匯放長，國貨廠商就不該自動跌價以减輕消費者的負担嗎？話却不是這樣說，外匯緊縮，貨價增高，外匯放長，貨價降落，這是邏輯上的推論，而事實上貨價之漲落，外匯之鬆緊，僅爲多種原因之一，而非唯一的原因。國貨之應减低售價，此爲理由之一，而减輕消費者之負祖，保存顧客所僅有的購買力，以期產銷雙方之共存，此實爲國貨廠商所亟應了解之一義。因爲目前國貨價値之高漲，在廠商方面有其不得已之苦衷，而在消費者方面則有無力購買之苦。更有甚者，國貨隨外匯之緊縮而增價，使向之熱心購用國貨　轉　購買外貨，則爲淵敺魚，爲叢敺爵，亦非國貨前途之福。矧値此非常時期，從事生產事業者應存爲國家民族服務之觀念，雖甘心虧折爲勢所不能，而利用非常時期以獲取過分之利得，亦非愛國愛民之道。須知國貨事業之基礎，建築於廣大之消費羣中，使消費者之信仰日　，購買無力，則國貨售價縱高與天齊，其誰問津；此種自殺政策，亦非愛護民族工業者所願聞。故吾以爲國貨　因不得已之悄形而增價，但在情勢許可之際，爲消費者之負担計，爲本身之信譽與營業計，亦不容其只漲不落，何去何從，斯在國貨界明達之一決。</p>
<h3>信誼藥廠</h3>
<p>— 塔珍</p>
<p>歷史</p>
<p>信誼藥廠創辦迄今，已閱二十年。初創時規模極小。嗣後資本，逐漸擴充，設總廠於法租界馬斯南路，並在南市滬軍營路一八七號設第一分廠，南市南京街一三二號設第二分廠。至二十六年滬戰起後，南市二廠，燬於砲火，而當局者抱不折不撓之心，另設分廠於愛文義路，並創辦信誼玻璃器械部，及血淸疫苗廠等，不惜巨資向歐美各國，添購各項機械與儀器，力謀發展，殊堪效慕。現該廠資本共有六十萬。</p>
<p>組織</p>
<p>該廠爲股份有限公司最高爲董事會，其次即爲總經理，總管全廠事務，此下則分設會計，宜傳，廣吿，營業，運輸，儲藏，包裝，製造，化學研究，文牘，庶務，編輯，印刷，盒子，凹版印刷，銅匠，人事，木匠，等部，各設主任而管理之。</p>
<p>職工</p>
<p>該廠共有職員七十餘，男女工共約四百餘，而女工更佔大多數，職員多爲寗波，定海，及本地人，敎育程度最低，爲初中肄業，大學生服務者頗多，製造部包裝部等處，皆爲女工，年齡均係二十歲左右間亦有三四十歲之婦人，敎育程度稍差，但頗肯努力。</p>
<p>營業</p>
<p>該廠營業極爲發達，每日平均數，約一二萬，外埠雖在抗戰之中，亦未遜色，在香港，汕頭，福州，昆明，天津，北平，靑島，濟南，重慶，新嘉坡等均設有辦事處。寗波，蘇州，金華等處有代表，以推廣業務。</p>
<p>設備</p>
<p>該廠設備，殊爲精良，製造部中多係歐美或德國之最新式機器及儀器化學硏究部之設備亦相當完備，該廠對機器均司有專人管理，並備有修理匠，一遇有損壞之處，當立即修理，電汽爐有二十餘座，專司注射液玻管封口之用，尙有烘藥室，內裝水汀，焙熏各藥，又有製賜保命室及新惜花散室，設備似更充實。印刷部有四架印刷機，並備有活字模及英文字模，以備印刷價目表，說明書，通知單，信封等之用。但普通鉛字却不多，尙有凹板印刷部，即市上小印刷所之設備尙小及此也。</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Observing the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>For the past two weeks, with the expansion of the war in Western Europe, the focus of the world's attention has not only been limited to Britain and France and Germany, which are in the midst of a bloody battle, but also more concentrated on the United States, Italy, and the Soviet Union, which are currently neutral; this is because the United States, Italy, and the Soviet Union are all world powers, and their actions have a significant impact. The strength of the belligerent countries is increasingly destroyed and reduced due to the war. On the contrary, the United States, Italy, and the Soviet Union are now able to maintain and increase all their strength because they have not yet been involved in the vortex, and at the same time, this has also increased the importance of these three countries; therefore, how their movements will naturally have a major impact on the future international situation, and are the focus of the world's attention. The current trend is very clear: the United States is enthusiastically sympathizing with Britain and France, while Italy is somewhat biased towards Germany. In the past few days, the United States Congress has passed the special naval budget of 150 million yuan and the special army budget of 180 million yuan in the most rapid steps, the purpose of which is of course to counter the new threat of the aggressor countries and contains the role of supporting Britain and France. As for Italy, whether it is newspaper commentary or public gatherings, it is full of anti-British and anti-French cries; the government authorities are also preparing to act. Although based on a variety of complex and contradictory circumstances, Italy may not join the German side in a short period of time to confront Britain and France, and the United States is even less likely to immediately join the British and French sides to fight against Germany, but the United States' support for Britain and France and Italy's support for Germany are extremely distinct. Only the Soviet Union, which has been silent for a long time and observed the world change quietly, has an obscurity of attitude and a caution of action that is unmatched by any country; and its founding to the north, spanning Europe and Asia, its position is even more important than Italy, and on par with the United States, so its possible dynamics must be analyzed.</p>
<p>First, observe the Soviet Union's position in Europe. The strengthening of the Soviet Union's position in Europe is greater than today. Eastern Poland has been occupied by the Soviet Union; the three Baltic countries (Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania) have all signed mutual assistance agreements with the Soviet Union; after the end of the war with Finland, the demarcation work has also been completed recently; these countries were originally not a concern for the Soviet Union, but subjectively, the Soviet Union has been able to eliminate its worries; in addition, what is more important is of course the signing of the Soviet-German Non-Aggression Pact last year, releasing suspicion, turning enemies into friends, which is the Soviet Union's greatest success in Europe. Originally, Britain, France, Germany, and Italy were all capitalist countries, which were essentially opposed to the Soviet Union, and there was always the possibility of forming an "anti-Soviet crusade"; the Munich Conference in 1938 implicitly took the expulsion of the Soviet Union as a period. However, the signing of the Soviet-German Non-Aggression Pact showed that the internal contradictions between capitalist countries are greater than the contradictions with the Soviet Union, and soon the Second European War broke out. Since then, not only has Germany sought something from the Soviet Union, but Britain and France have not dared to openly confront the Soviet Union; the Anglo-Soviet trade negotiations are still in progress intermittently, which is a clear sign of the strengthening of the Soviet Union's position in Europe. From various aspects, the current Soviet authorities' observation of the future of the European war is probably like this: if Germany fails, Central Europe will suffer from the long-term post-war poverty, hunger, and disaster, and it is very likely to fall into the embrace of the Soviet Union, at which time the Soviet Union will be even stronger; after the war, Britain and France will be covered with sores, and of course they will not think of dealing with the Soviet Union. If Britain and France are repeatedly defeated, but still have the courage to sell, and are unwilling to succumb to Germany, then the United States, for its own interests, and to prevent the threat of Nazism from affecting the Americas, will come out to rescue Britain and France in order to rebuild the European balance of power; therefore, as long as the confrontation between Britain, France, and Germany continues to exist for one day, the Soviet Union will certainly protect its own safety outside the game. Therefore, no matter how the European war situation develops, it will not harm the Soviet Union, but will instead enhance the Soviet Union's position in Europe. The above two assumptions are the divergent paths of the evolution of the overall European situation in the near future; the Soviet Union can always sit back and watch the decision of the divergent paths, without using its worries and hesitations; what has become a problem is that, assuming that Germany and Italy form a closer unity, trample on Britain and France, and form an overwhelming advantage in dominating Europe, then the Soviet Union, for the sake of the more distant future, will always sit back and watch. To what extent will it tolerate? Or will it combine more with Germany and Italy in order to share the spoils? This is a huge problem.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union's danger zone is still in the Far East; the Soviet Union's main opponent is still Japan. This can be seen from the recent Japanese public opinion. Since the recent expansion of the European war, Japanese public opinion has almost unanimously and urgently clamored for how to end the "China Incident" as soon as possible in order to reap the fisherman's benefits in the European war; their view is that Britain is focusing all its efforts on fighting against Germany, and there is a possibility of softening towards Japan in the Far East, and as long as Japan avoids stimulating it again, the United States may not break with Japan; but towards the Soviet Union, they are unanimously hostile. In our observation, what the Japanese imagine about Britain and the United States is completely self-deception. The United States is a civilized country, and President Roosevelt has foresight and ambition, and will never compromise with aggressors, needless to say. As for Britain, he is using the theory of anti-aggression to fight against Germany and to maintain the mood of national unity, and he must not destroy his soul by compromising with Japan, not to mention that Churchill is in power, with a clear and firm consciousness, which is completely different from Chamberlain's appeasement policy; and he cannot run counter to the national policy of the United States because he is too busy to integrate with the United States. As for Japan's attitude towards the Soviet Union, it is because it will never allow its neighboring country to be strong, its aggression against China is based on this, and its hostility towards the Soviet Union is also based on this. China and the Soviet Union are both connected to Japan's territory, and the people of both countries can strive to make progress; in the eyes of the narrow-minded, jealous, and greedy Japanese, as long as China and the Soviet Union are weak, the entire Asian continent should be the private property of Japan; this is what Japan grits its teeth, so it must invade China and oppose the Soviet Union. Therefore, when China is strong, Japan is both resentful and angry; and the more consolidated the Soviet Union's position in Europe is, the deeper the jealousy it receives from Japan in the Far East. This subtle pivot, the important relationship, is of course valued by the Soviet government, and it must concentrate its efforts to deal with it. Therefore, the trade negotiations between Britain and the Soviet Union are continuous, and may even conclude a trade agreement; at the same time, the Soviet Union is also working hard to maintain the Soviet-German relations just right. The Soviet Union's skillful orchestration in European international relations is to consolidate its position to the point of leaving no regrets. This is precisely the cause and effect of its strength in the Far East policy and its deep-seated hatred of Japan, and they are mutually supportive; and the unanimous anti-Soviet sentiment of the Japanese government and the public is only the opposite explanation of the Soviet Union's attitude.</p>
<h3>Meeting of the Northern and Southern Allied Forces: German Left Wing Under Great Threat; Fierce Fighting in Flanders; French Forces on the South Bank of the Somme Consolidate Positions</h3>
<p>Berlin: The German News Agency acknowledged that large contingents of Allied reinforcements had arrived, especially motorized and mechanized units. Although German aircraft launched fierce attacks, they could not stop them. However, the Allied attempt to break through the German lines failed, and several divisions of fresh German infantry had also arrived at various locations. The German forces now outnumbered the enemy, according to a Reuters report on the 25th.</p>
<p>Paris: Today, the fighting west of Cambrai was extremely intense. The French claimed to have recovered all lost territory on the Oise and Aisne rivers and had consolidated their positions on the Somme. For internal military reasons, the authorities responsible maintained strict silence on the progress of the battle of Cambrai. It was claimed here that although the situation was serious and chaotic, there was no reason to lose faith. The French announced that the great battle in Flanders was extremely fierce. Although German losses were very heavy, there had been no practical change in the battle situation so far. According to French official reports, this morning the Germans, with more armored units, broke through the gap between Arras and Picardy and advanced towards Abbeville and Beauvais. These units, accompanied by weak mechanized infantry units, advanced towards the northwest coast. Several other weak German units were sent to the north and northwest to protect the German right wing, but were easily blocked by Allied forces near Saint-Omer. The situation in Beauvais was unclear, but Calais had not been attacked. All the territory occupied by the Germans on the Oise and Aisne rivers on Thursday had been recovered. French forces on the left bank of the Somme continued to conduct mopping-up operations last night and this morning, capturing hundreds of soldiers. The German advance south of Sedan had been halted, according to a Reuters report on the 25th.</p>
<p>Paris: Military observers are closely watching the development of the great battle in northern France. The war zone there is expanding daily. With the possibility of the Germans launching a general offensive at any time, the French forces are also preparing to launch a counteroffensive. Military circles are maintaining absolute secrecy on this matter. As for other fronts, matters are all of a local nature and not very important in military terms. Battle reports from various locations are recorded as follows: (1) The British authorities announced yesterday that some British and Belgian units had retreated on the Belgian front. It is now known that these units were very small in number and not worth mentioning. (2) In the Picardy region, after hesitating for several days, the Germans this morning sent tank units to attack between the city of Arras and the Somme, attempting to pursue northwest to reach the ports of the English Channel. (3) Although the situation in the port of Beauvais is very chaotic, the Germans have not yet attacked the port of Calais. (4) All the fallen towns in the Upper Argonne region have been recovered by the French forces, according to a Havas dispatch on the 25th.</p>
<p>London: Sources reported at 1:00 PM today that the German forces in the Strait area of French territory had lost contact with the main German forces as a result of the Allied forces closing the gap between the northern and southern armies. However, this report has not been officially confirmed. According to earlier reports describing the Allied advance, the Allied forces had reached the connecting point of Cambrai, Saint-Quentin, and Péronne, thus rejoining this large chain of defense. When the Allied forces attempted to link their two armies, the northern Allied army advanced from Ghent towards Valenciennes and Cambrai, and the southern Allied army advanced from Péronne towards Laon, Rethel, and Sedan, while the French forces in Arras and Bapaume were positioned between the Belgian and British forces. Although officials were reluctant to reveal the truth in war bulletins, it was believed here that since Wednesday, the Allied forces had made considerable progress, gradually approaching the gap through which the German forces broke through to reach Beauvais. According to this unconfirmed news today, the Allied forces in the north had broken through the German lines and joined forces with General Weygand's army south of this gap, and the narrow German lifeline between the Somme and the Scarpe was reportedly threatened by the French forces between Péronne and Cambrai. After the Allied forces in the north and south joined forces, the French, Belgian, and Dutch armies formed a strong defensive line along the Escaut River, and the German right wing on that river was under fierce attack from the British forces in Bapaume, Cambrai, Valenciennes, and Audenarde. Before the news of the Allied repair of the gap arrived, military experts had pointed out that the Allied artillery was sufficient to deal with this gap. Regardless of whether this breakthrough corridor (i.e., the gap) was twenty or twenty-four miles wide, the Allied artillery fire on both sides of this gap was sufficient to deter German activity in this area, so it could ultimately cut off the communication between the reserve troops advancing to the coast by breaking through the Allied lines and their reinforcements, according to a United Press dispatch on the 25th.</p>
<p>German War Report</p>
<p>Berlin: The Supreme Command announced in a bulletin today that the encirclement of Belgian forces and parts of the French First, Ninth, and Seventh Armies, as well as a large British Expeditionary Force, had been effectively completed. The areas east of this encirclement, Ghent and Courtrai, had been occupied by German forces, and the Germans had also captured the Vimy Ridge. Calais had been surrounded. The high ground above Lillers and Saint-Omer to Gravelines had been taken by German forces. The enemy lost eighty-four aircraft yesterday, and seven German aircraft were missing, according to a Reuters dispatch on the 25th.</p>
<p>Berlin: German military circles here claimed last night that German forces had entered Calais, Beauvais, and Ghent yesterday and predicted that the war in northern France and Belgium could be ended by the end of May. The German side did not state that the three cities had completely fallen, only that German forces had entered the three cities, but the fall of the three cities was imminent. They also stated that the German forces in the south could advance to Dunkirk and Ostend within these few days and meet the German forces in the north there. According to a military source, "Once our army controls the English Channel, the enemy will be completely surrounded. At that time, our army can issue orders to encircle from all sides, followed by a final annihilation battle." German mechanized units had captured Saint-Omer, 25 miles southeast of Calais. The German High Command had not yet been able to confirm this, but German military circles said that it was possible. According to a German news agency, of the original twelve divisions of the Belgian army, only two divisions were fighting on the northern front yesterday. The German side was gradually gaining an advantage in the number of troops fighting in northern France and southern Belgium. In northern France and Belgium, the Allied forces surrounded number one million, and half have now been annihilated. The news agency said that these Allied forces could be surrounded and annihilated, or driven into the sea, or divided into small sections and then wiped out, according to a United Press dispatch on the 25th.</p>
<p>The Germans Risk Everything, Cherishing the Ambition to Conquer Britain</p>
<p>London: According to a dispatch from a neutral country's correspondent in Berlin, German officials openly admitted that Germany was currently exerting all its strength to make a do-or-die effort on the Western Front. The Germans understood that the outcome of the war might depend on the current battle, so they dispatched all their mechanized equipment to the battle. Many believed that the battle in northern France and Belgium was the first part of Hitler's plan, but the resistance encountered by the German forces today seemed to be beyond their initial calculations, and the entire plan of Hitler's strategy was a direct attack on Britain, according to a Reuters dispatch on the 25th.</p>
<p>Rome: The German Supreme Command announced last night that the German forces had won great victories on both land and sea, and the highest military circles here indicated that Hitler had planned to begin a war to invade Britain by the end of May, according to a United Press dispatch on the 25th.</p>
<p>London: Hitler's greatest ambition is generally believed to be the conquest of Britain. Now, the German army's direct attack on Britain is indeed imminent. The British, in view of this, are now strengthening their coastal defenses for self-preservation. King George VI warned the entire British Empire yesterday that German forces were moving north from Beauvais, threatening Calais and advancing towards Ostend. Therefore, the Empire is now undergoing a dangerous test. He said, "The enemy abroad is not only seeking the conquest of land but also plotting to completely overthrow the British Empire, and then to conquer the entire world." Officials said that Dover and other ports along the coast were all prepared, "Waiting for Hitler's magic weapon to arrive." At that time, the Allied anti-aircraft artillery would drive German aircraft away from the southeast coast of Britain. Dover, Folkestone, Harwich, and Newport were all carefully arranged, but apart from the visible artillery positions and naval and army forces, other defense situations could be kept secret. It was learned from reliable sources that new secret defense strategies and secret weapons had been invented. When the news of the fall of Beauvais reached Britain, the British remained calm as usual and did not panic and try to escape. British strategists admitted that the Germans were planning to use all the air force bases they had seized in the Netherlands to launch a direct attack on Britain. In terms of offensive, the German position was indeed better than a month ago, but the British military intelligence office had not announced that the German army had any large-scale troop movements. Many believed that General Weygand had already devised a strategy to first cut off the German salient troops, and then restore the Allied front in France and Belgium. However, the German army had launched a fierce attack on the English Channel, advancing without retreating for five days, and the Allied forces had not established anything in terms of tactics. This had to be regarded as a serious situation, according to a dispatch from the 25th International News Service.</p>
<p>Prelude to the German Attack on Britain: Yorkshire, England, Attacked by Air Raids Yesterday</p>
<p>London: German aircraft today bombed Norfolk, Suffolk, Essex in northeastern England, and Yorkshire, the center of the British textile industry. Most people believe that the German aircraft's bombing may be a prelude to a blitzkrieg attack on Britain. In Yorkshire, eleven civilians were killed or injured. One of the German bombs fell on a huge empty house, and all the glass windows were shattered. The city's huge electric clock was also shocked and stopped. Although Essex was bombed, the damage was very small, and there were no deaths or injuries. Military observers believed that the German aircraft that bombed Britain this time may have taken off from bases in the Netherlands, according to a United Press dispatch on the 25th.</p>
<p>London: The possible threat of a German invasion of Britain became more serious this morning. Several German aircraft carried out extensive bombing in Yorkshire on the east coast of Britain, injuring eight civilians. When the German aircraft were discovered, the local anti-aircraft artillery immediately began firing, forcing the German aircraft to fly into the clouds, and the infantry defending against paratroopers stood guard, closely prepared, for fear that paratroopers would land. As a result, no paratroopers landed, and the German aircraft also flew away, according to a United Press dispatch on the 25th.</p>
<p>Ghent, the Economic and Cultural Center of Belgium, Occupied by German Forces</p>
<p>Berlin: Senior German officials met with a reporter from the Hague News Agency last night and made a statement supplementing the official report as follows: "Before judging the battle situation on the Belgian-French border, two points must first be understood to have a correct concept: (1) The enemy army attacked by the German infantry had approximately equal strength; (2) The German mechanized units advanced rapidly. After fierce fighting, they had driven back the enemy forces from the strong fortifications of the Scheldt River and defeated the Belgian city of Ghent. Ghent is the capital of the province of East Flanders, Belgium, located at the confluence of the Scheldt and Lys rivers. The city has a population of approximately 230,000, mostly of the Flemish ethnicity, so the city is also the center of the Flemish national movement and cultural life. The Ghent-Terneuzen Canal is approximately 33 kilometers long and connects to the Western Scheldt. The city of Ghent is known as the 'Manchester of Belgium,' which shows its important economic position. The textile industry, with cotton, silk, and flax as the most important, is mostly exported abroad. There are many ancient buildings in the city, including the Saint Bavo Cathedral. The cathedral houses many ancient artifacts. The Flemish University is also located in the city. The school was founded in 1816. During the last World War, the city of Ghent was occupied by German forces in October 1914. The German forces withdrew from the city on November 11, 1918, the day of the armistice in Europe," according to a dispatch from the 25th Hague News Agency.</p>
<p>The Magnificent View of German Coastal Anti-Aircraft Fire</p>
<h3>Fierce Air Battle Between British and German Air Forces Over the Franco-Belgian Coast; British Spitfire Fighters Show Their Power, Shooting Down Up to Forty German Aircraft</h3>
<p>London: The British Air Ministry announced last night that eleven of our fighters were patrolling over the French coast this afternoon when they encountered a large enemy formation and launched an attack. Eleven Messerschmitt German aircraft were shot down, and three others were severely damaged. None of our aircraft were lost. There was large-scale intense aerial activity over the Franco-Belgian front yesterday day and night and today. British Air Force bombers repeatedly attacked enemy columns near Arras and Beauvais, and at night launched fierce attacks on enemy transport lines in northeastern France, southern Belgium, and the Rhine region. The targets in northeastern France hit by our heavy bombers included military objectives in Bavay and Hirson, which caught fire after being hit. The rail junction at La Horgne was also hit. A large group of troops and transport vehicles in Givet, near the Meuse River, was heavily damaged by bombing. The rail junction at Beaumont was hit by bombs, and a large train caught fire and burned. Our aircraft also attacked the road junction at Crécy, seeing a truck team explode nearby after being hit, and also attacked Charleroi, which also exploded after being hit. Our heavy bombers flew to the Rhine region, bombing enemy transportation in Cologne and Koblenz in the Eifel region. Six of our aircraft did not return. Our fighters continued to win victories against enemy aircraft. According to the news received so far, at least eighty enemy aircraft have been shot down or severely damaged since yesterday morning. Ten of our fighters are missing, but some of the pilots may return to their units. Last week, enemy aircraft lost at least five hundred aircraft in France and Belgium. Since their invasion of Belgium and the Netherlands, the total number of aircraft lost has exceeded 1,500, according to a Reuters dispatch on the 25th.</p>
<h3>China's Concern Over the European War Situation</h3>
<p>Chongqing: Chinese officials are deeply concerned about the development of the European war, especially the current fighting in the ports of the Strait. They understand that the outcome of the war will inevitably have a far-reaching impact on the situation in the Far East. Chinese officials and the public are now eagerly awaiting the latest news from the European war. The ministers of the Chinese government recently convened a meeting to ask Foreign Minister Wang Chong-hui to review the latest developments in the European war, and the outcome of the European war is the topic of conversation in schools and public institutions. However, most people are hesitant and do not openly declare their support for any of the belligerents, according to a Reuters dispatch on the 25th.</p>
<h3>Across the English Channel: Flames Shooting Straight Into the Sky; British Warships Bomb French Coastal Highways; Rumors that Germany Will Use Long-Range Artillery to Attack Britain</h3>
<p>London: As the residents of the northeastern towns of England experienced air raids for the first time, the people in the villages slightly south of the northeastern towns saw a sea of flames on the French coast across the sea in the areas of Beauvais and Calais, and heard the continuous rumble of artillery fire. This artillery fire was the sound of British warships bombarding the coastal highways between Beauvais and Calais, according to a United Press dispatch on the 25th.</p>
<p>Milan: According to a report from a battlefield correspondent for the Milan "Stampa" newspaper, Tolera, the German army in Flanders is about to use special long-range artillery to bombard the English Channel. This artillery has not yet been used in mobile warfare, so it will pose another unexpected threat to the Allies, according to a dispatch from the 25th Hague News Agency.</p>

<h3>British Empire Day: British King's Broadcast Address; Fighting for Freedom and Justice as the Goal; Hoping for Universal Unity to Achieve Victory</h3>
<p>London: British King George VI delivered an Empire Memorial Day broadcast address to the nation last night, saying that the world must discern the purpose of our country's enemies, which is no longer to occupy land, but to completely overthrow the Empire and everything it possesses, and then to conquer the entire world. If they can achieve their wishes, they will surely complete all the hatred and brutality they have already demonstrated. We sincerely find it difficult to believe that there are such vicious plans in the human psyche, but the period of doubt has long passed. At present, the people of the Empire and the people of the world who have vision and goodwill have already understood this situation. Last year on Empire Memorial Day, I addressed the people of the Empire from Winnipeg, the heart of Canada, saying that the foundation of our free people's federation is the concept of freedom, justice, and peace. Afterwards, the war clouds gathered, and I still hoped that the above-mentioned concepts could still establish more sufficient development and allow the people to avoid the pain of war and massacre. But the result was the opposite. The disaster that we constantly worked to avoid and sincerely hoped to avoid finally came. We did not realize this until this time, because what was revealed was a long-planned plan to conquer the nations of the world by force, so all our peace efforts were in vain.</p>
<p>At present, we have reached the time of the decisive battle. I will tell you plainly that in this time of trouble, there is nothing else you expect from me except this understanding. The current war is a life-and-death duel for us. The meaning of failure will not be a temporary setback that can be revived on the day of strength recovery, but the destruction of our world. We can imagine the darkness after this destruction. I am speaking to you today in the new phenomenon of the current British Empire. At present, this phenomenon has come into conflict with the evil system that is trying to carry out destruction and has been compared with each other. Its full importance has appeared in a brighter and more fixed light.</p>
<p>Our enemy is now using one word to resist us, namely "imperialism." Their use of this word contains a spirit of arrogance and conquest. In fact, our free people of the Empire have long ceased to put this word on their lips. Those who use this word are those who harbor evil intentions. The purpose we hold is peace. Our system can only develop in peace. The conditions of our people can only improve in peace. The problems of the government can only be resolved in the spirit of goodwill in peace. The enemy has now taken this peace from us. They are trying to destroy everything we have worked to maintain. Whoever resists our honesty is a disgrace, whoever resists our loyalty is a traitor, and whoever resists our justice is a barbaric force. The opposing armies are now in this clear and immovable opposition. The roar of all the people of the Empire undoubtedly shows who can prevail. They rise up in righteous anger against what they hate, and nothing can shake their determination. They are united in defending their lives and everything that makes their lives worth living. When I tell you how dangerous the disaster we are facing today is, please do not think that my confidence is dim, but this kind of confidence shines in my heart, its light is like shining in your hearts. But holding only confidence is of no avail, and it must be combined with courage and determination, perseverance and self-sacrifice. These are the noble virtues that the soldiers who come from home and abroad and fight on land, sea, and air are displaying. At this moment, our thoughts are inclined to our battles, and love and soldiers, love and mothers, wives, and lovers. Beside them stand the soldiers of our Allied France. With them are the people of Poland, Belgium, and the Netherlands. The peaceful lands of these three countries have all fallen into the tragedy of fraud and innocent aggression.</p>
<p>In this critical moment, we are like our ancestors who encountered great disasters in the past, but with this heart inclined to Heaven, I have asked in this ancient country that the following Sunday be a day of national prayer. Many of our compatriots overseas may or may not join the people in this prayer. Let us be of one heart and one mind, trusting in God to accomplish the cause we hold. May we bravely defend the rights that God has bestowed upon us. People, men, and women of the Empire all over the world, I now admonish you, no matter what work you are undertaking, do your best with all the courage and will you can muster. Always keep your heart high and your will unyielding. With one heart and one mind, move forward bravely, with a smile on your face and your head held high. We rely on God's help, and we will surely fail. According to a Reuters dispatch on the 25th.</p>
<p>Washington: All radio stations in the United States stopped all broadcast programs to broadcast the British King's speech. The entire United States clearly heard the speech. The sections of the speech involving the Nazi ambitions that have attacked families and the loud appeal to all well-intentioned people in the world are nothing less than the call of the people. This was really impossible two weeks ago. According to a Reuters dispatch on the 24th.</p>
<h3>Berlin's Reaction</h3>
<p>Berlin: After British King George delivered his speech, Dr. Dietrich, the director of the German government information office, replied, stating that British King George VI stated that Britain was based on the ideals of freedom, justice, and peace, but the history of the British Empire proves that Britain's foundation is oppression rather than freedom, plunder rather than justice, and sin rather than peace. The British King claimed that he aimed at peace, but it was Britain that encouraged Poland to fight, Britain that sacrificed Norway, the Netherlands, and Belgium, and Britain that declared war on Germany and caused the war. Germany has repeatedly suggested maintaining world peace, but it has been rejected by Britain. The British King's cowardly words have revealed Britain's true face. Germany's weapons will give an appropriate answer, according to a dispatch from the 25th Hague News Agency.</p>
<h3>British Prime Minister's Letter to the Trade Union Congress: Please Endure Sacrifices</h3>
<p>London: Prime Minister Churchill wrote to the special congress of the trade union executive committees jointly organized by the Trade Union Congress and meeting today, saying that the needs of the country cannot be satisfied, cannot be avoided, and are urgent. If we cannot cope with it, the future will be even greater. We have great faith in the organized labor's readiness to accept all the obligations to endure and work hard for the sacrifices that the country is forced to demand of them. The seriousness of time is deepening every hour. All of us should make the greatest efforts to defend the country, maintain our freedom, and achieve victory. The congress has approved the General Affairs Committee's resolution to organize all the resources of the country and do everything possible to defeat the invading army, so as to help defend the people and reject all the necessary plans contained in the current situation. After Labor Minister Bevin explained the program he was about to carry out, the congress passed a resolution expressing deep admiration for those who bravely defended freedom, namely the armed forces and merchant marine navy of the Allied countries, resisting the invading army with iron enemy power in order to achieve victory, according to a Reuters dispatch on the 25th.</p>
<h3>British Exercise Dictatorial Power, Purging Internal Traitors, Fascist Party Members Continue to be Exiled, 70,000 Transportation Workers Mobilized</h3>
<p>London - Twenty-one men and four women were arrested in London yesterday, reportedly mostly related to the British Fascist Union. The authorities, acting under the National Defence Regulations, had already arrested the leader of the Fascist Union, Sir Oswald Mosley, and thirty-four other Fascist party members two days prior. (Reuter, 25th)</p>
<p>London - Captain Lindtorp, the former head of German spies in the United States during the last war, has been arrested by the British authorities. After the war, Lindtorp resided in Britain and had applied for British naturalization. (Reuter, 25th)</p>
<p>London - Britain's domestic defence against German paratroopers and the "Fifth Column" is becoming increasingly effective. The London Transport Board has also mobilized 79,000 workers and staff, deploying them to various locations to prevent the sabotage of roads and other key transportation points. (Havas, 24th)</p>
<p>London - According to a special dispatch published today, two neutral newspapers criticized the special powers granted to the government by the British Parliament. The "Gothenburg Daily" stated that a dictatorial system is more powerful and ruthless than other systems. Britain is now united and behind it, and has demanded it. The war must be won, and nothing else matters. Everyone knows that Britain's dictatorship will not last a day longer than necessary. No one dislikes dictatorship more than the British, but no one is better at using it to achieve success. The "New York Times" stated that British labour has demonstrated its extraordinary patriotism. The bill to take away the right of labour groups to advocate for their own working conditions was proposed by Labour Party leader Attlee himself. The bill also takes away the right of capitalists to manage their own property. (Reuter, 24th)</p>
<h3>South Africa Determined to Fight to the End, Strictly Preventing Fifth Column Activities, Clearance of Sea Mines Completed</h3>
<p>Johannesburg - South African Prime Minister General Smuts issued a warning last night at a public banquet celebrating his 70th birthday, stating that the government would deal with "Fifth Column" elements. He mentioned the enthusiastic response in South Africa to the call for volunteers, and continued, stating that the world would be greatly impoverished at the end of the war, and that there may be unprecedented poverty after the greatest destruction in history. In the last war, the Germans failed despite having an invincible military apparatus, due to a psychological defect. This psychological defect remains unchanged and will cause Germany to collapse again. South Africa is determined to fight to the end with all its strength. (Reuter, 29th)</p>
<p>Cape Town - Defence authorities announced that the work of clearing sea mines off Cape Agulhas has been successfully completed, and no ships have been damaged. (Reuter, 25th)</p>
<h3>Canadian Fascist Party Headquarters Searched</h3>
<p>Montreal - The Royal Canadian Mounted Police recently searched the premises of saboteurs, seized documents that have been examined, and announced that they will take "the most definite" action. Last night and early this morning, the RCMP conducted surprise searches in several locations, believed to be the residences and offices of leaders of the National Unity Party (a Fascist organization), and the party's headquarters was also searched. No arrests were made, but an officer said that the authorities would issue arrest warrants. (Reuter, 24th)</p>
<h3>German Strength Today is Not What it Was, Goebbels Publishes an Article</h3>
<p>Berlin - German Propaganda Minister Goebbels published an article in the "Greater German Weekly," stating that it would be a gross misrepresentation to compare today's European war with the previous one, as today's situation is unprecedented. For example, in 1914, Germany was surrounded diplomatically, but today Hitler has used political and military force to completely destroy the encirclement. In terms of economic conditions, Germany was also surrounded in the past. Although Britain and France are trying to repeat their old tricks, Germany is prepared for the blockade, rendering the enemy's measures ineffective. In the past, Germany did not mobilize all of its material and human resources during the war. Today, it has the latest machinery and weapons, and the people of the whole country are behind the leader, so the soldiers can use their full strength to charge forward and serve on the battlefield. In terms of psychological warfare and propaganda, Germany took a completely defensive posture in 1914, but today it has switched to an offensive one. Therefore, it is difficult for enemy countries to succeed if they fabricate news of German atrocities, claiming how brutal Germany is, in the hope of arousing the world's aversion to Germany. There is no shortage of people who rely on hearsay, believing that Germany's political and military victories this time are all due to good fortune and luck, which is biased. The famous German general Moltke said, "In the long run, only the talented and intelligent can always be lucky." How well said! (Haitong, 25th)</p>
<h3>Western Front War, Casualty Estimates, Allied Forces Suffer Greater Losses Than German Forces</h3>
<p>New York - According to military officer reports from both Berlin and Paris yesterday, since the German invasion of the Netherlands and Belgium, the Allied forces have lost approximately twice as many soldiers, aircraft, and tanks as the Germans. Combined, the deaths of soldiers on both sides are estimated at 300,000 to 400,000, and the injured at approximately one million. Reports from Paris stated that approximately 100,000 to 150,000 German soldiers have been killed, and approximately 350,000 to 400,000 have been injured. 1,200 German aircraft have been shot down, and 1,300 German tanks and armored vehicles have been destroyed. Reports from Berlin, however, stated that approximately 200,000 to 300,000 Allied soldiers have been killed, and 400,000 to 500,000 have been injured. 2,100 aircraft have been shot down, and 2,000 tanks have been destroyed.

<h3>Shiratori Advocates Economic Aid to Germany</h3>
<p>Tokyo, Japan - Former Japanese Ambassador to Germany, Toshio Shiratori, told reporters from the United Press here yesterday that he would request Japan to "do its best for Germany in diplomatic and economic terms." Although Shiratori advocates that Japan form a military alliance with Germany and Italy, he does not support providing military assistance to Germany. Shiratori stated, "We agree with the concept of a totalitarian state. Although I do not support military action, I advocate doing my best for Germany in diplomatic and economic terms. Joining the German side's demands is on the rise. If Italy enters the war, that demand will increase even more, but I fear interference is too late, because all the important decisions of the past ten years have led to the current direct action. There is currently no way to restrain other governments. During the tenure of Admiral Mitsumasa Yonai, there is no need for democratic countries to fear, but in the event of a cabinet reshuffle, the Japanese government will adopt a tough policy." Shiratori stated that when he spoke with German Air Force Minister Marshal Goering last year, Goering stated, "The next war can be concluded before the United States can send reinforcements." (United Press, 25th)</p>
<h3>Italian Observation Group Tours Germany, Fink Receives Them Yesterday</h3>

<h3>Japanese Government Decides to Dissolve Trade Unions, Shigeru Yoshida Makes a Statement</h3>
<p>Tokyo - Minister of Welfare Shigeru Yoshida recently stated that the current labour regulations in Japan are based on the recognition of the right to strike and the opposition of labour and capital, which must be revised.

<h3>Rome Holds Air Defence Exercises, War Enthusiasm Fills the Country, Armed Soldiers Open Borders and Strengthen Defences, Britain Sends Halifax to Madrid to Prevent Spain from Entering the War</h3>
<p>Rome - An official document here stated that the results of the air defence exercises and fire brigade exercises held in Rome and Turin were very satisfactory, and there was no need for further practice. (Haitong, 25th)</p>
<p>London - Concerns in diplomatic circles here increased last night that Italy may soon join the German side and participate in the European war vortex. Here, fears are also increasing that if Mussolini joins forces with Hitler, Italy will attempt to drag Spain into the German-Italian side to fight the Allied forces. It is widely believed that the British government sent Lord Halifax as a special envoy to Madrid, with the aim of finding a way to prevent Spain from joining the war. Britain's concern about Italy joining the European war can be demonstrated by the Mediterranean, as all British women and children in Gibraltar have been evacuated. Over the past week, Britain has attempted to alleviate some of Italy's grievances, but diplomatic circles admitted last night that relations between Rome and the Allied forces have not improved. On the contrary, the whole of Italy is filled with war enthusiasm. The public cheers as armed soldiers pass through the streets of major cities, opening the way to the Italian border to strengthen defences. The National Veterans Association in Rome passed a resolution yesterday, reaffirming their willingness to be sent to the front line to fight for Italy. Thousands of new slogans were found on the streets of Rome yesterday, declaring, "Long live Italian Corsica!" (Corsica is an island in the Mediterranean near Italy, belonging to France, with an area of 3,368 square miles and a population of 282,000.) Diplomatic circles here also noted the movements of Italian ships last night. Several Italian merchant ships have cancelled their sailing dates, while others have postponed their sailing dates to mid-June. Observers here pointed out that although the suspension of Italian merchant ships to the Far East is due to a lack of passengers, this issue does not apply to the United States, as thousands of American refugees are waiting for ships in Italy to return home. (United Press, 25th)</p>
<h3>Italy's Civilian Mobilization Law is Comprehensive, Published in the Official Gazette, to be Implemented Before Mobilization is Ordered</h3>
<p>Rome - A comprehensive civilian mobilization law was published in today's official gazette, which revises existing legislation on national organization and mobilization in preparation for war. Under this new law, all civilian public and private organizations and companies, and all capital, property, and inventions, can be requisitioned. Goods can be distributed according to population, and imports and exports can be restricted or prohibited. Orders can also be issued to report all capital. Those who are not of military age, and women and children over the age of fourteen, can be mobilized to participate in civilian service under military discipline. This law can be put into effect before mobilization is ordered. The Supreme Defence Committee, with Mussolini as chairman and including all cabinet members, is responsible for organizing and mobilizing the entire country in wartime. The Chiefs of Staff of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, and the War Industries Committee, may be ordered to join when necessary. (Reuter, 25th)</p>
<p>Italian People Express Willingness to Serve the Country Loyally</p>
<p>Rome - Italian Prime Minister Mussolini received many letters and telegrams yesterday on the 25th anniversary of Italy's participation in the European War, all expressing the Italian people's willingness to follow the Prime Minister's orders and serve the country loyally in times of emergency. (Haitong, 25th)</p>
<p>Rome - Yesterday, the 25th anniversary of Italy's participation in the World War against Germany passed quietly. There were no noisy demonstrations in the streets of Rome. Rather than calling it a pro-German day, it should be called an anti-Allied day. The newspapers all said that Italy was fighting against Austria, and did not mention that today's allies were yesterday's enemies. The main points of the editorials were "the perfidy of Italy's former allies," and "the time has come for the old plutocratic countries to settle accounts." (Reuter, 25th)</p>
<p>Rome - The number of people in Italy who advocate joining the war has been increasing daily. The National Council of Academies, the general organization of national scientific and cultural groups, convened an extraordinary meeting today to discuss the issues raised by Italy's legitimate desires. A resolution was immediately passed, stating that at a time when the Italian nation is safeguarding its independence and seeking the development of its empire, the Council will be loyal to the King and the Prime Minister, and will fulfill its duties, regardless of any difficulties encountered. (Havas, 24th)</p>
<p>Rome Radio Station Reports on the European Situation</p>
<p>Rome - The Rome Radio Station issued a report yesterday on the current European situation, stating that the interruption of British and French telephone lines and the cancellation of music programs by French radio stations are symbolic of the current situation in Britain and France. Public opinion in both countries now recognizes that the former's assessment of the European situation was wrong. Not only is this true militarily, but Britain and France have also never understood the strength of other countries politically. All new achievements, new developments, and new realities have been ignored by Britain and France, but now they have suddenly awakened. The activities of German aircraft have made both British officials and civilians feel the threat of the British Isles being occupied. On the German side, the "Steel Pact" with Italy has just celebrated its one-year anniversary. This pact proves to the world that international relations are now being universally revised. A "New Era" is being born, and the "Old World" is about to collapse. (Haitong, 25th)</p>

<h3>Egypt Willing to Maintain Friendly Relations with Italy</h3>
<p>Rome - According to a report from the Italian Stefani News Agency, Egyptian Prime Minister Ali Maher stated yesterday that the relationship between Italy and Egypt is based on harmonious neighbourliness, as evidenced by the agreement signed two years ago. He hopes that nothing will disrupt this friendly relationship, and that the two countries will continue to be friendly as usual. The Prime Minister also mentioned Italy's vast colonies, which Egypt has treated favourably. (Reuter, 25th)</p>
<h3>US House of Representatives Passes Unlimited Expansion of Army Air Corps, Roosevelt Announces Training of 50,000 Pilots Starting July 1st</h3>
<p>Washington - Today, the House of Representatives passed the bill allowing unlimited expansion of the Army Air Corps under President Roosevelt's proposed $1,182,000,000 defence program and sent it to the Senate. This bill will permit 6,000 Air Corps officers to be on active duty at any one time, and will temporarily terminate the 6,000-person limit for the Army Air Corps by June 30, 1941. (Reuter, 24th)</p>
<p>Washington - President Roosevelt announced here yesterday that the government plans to train 50,000 air force pilots in the next fiscal year (starting July 1st) as reserves for the Army, Navy, and Marine Corps. The new plan is to expand last year's program of training 10,000 pilots by civilian aviation organizations. According to the President's plan, pilots will be recruited from three civilian sources: (1) high school and university students; (2) citizens with flying licenses who have stopped flying; (3) citizens aged 18 to 22 who have not graduated. Recently, the government considered a recommendation from Congress to provide 300,000 members of the civilian defence corps with military training immediately. The civilian defence corps is currently subject to military discipline, but has not received training in the use of weapons. Those in Congress who favour the militarization of the civilian defence corps said that after the corps receives military training, it can double the number of US regular troops. Furthermore, the military training of the civilian defence corps will not affect the country's main industries. It will also play an important role in President Roosevelt's $4,000,000,000 military expansion program for the next year. (United Press, 25th)</p>

<p>Jackson, Mississippi - Federal Security Administrator McNutt said in a speech here last night that the United States' sea, land, and air forces are not yet sufficient and should be greatly strengthened so that no country or group of countries in the world would dare to look directly at the Western Hemisphere. He said, "I firmly believe that if the Allied forces are defeated, only the vast military power of the United States will be able to prevent war in the Western Hemisphere." He said that the United States only has a "vague understanding" of the impact on US security of the "tacit cooperation" between the three powers in the East and West. He was clearly referring to Germany, Italy, and Japan. "It is time for us to be determined to defend the entire North and South American continent. At this moment, we should not discuss the mere millions of dollars in defence costs for the Panama Canal, which is a key point for attacking any of our coasts. Our current preparations to defend both coastlines are absolutely insufficient to cope with the combined forces of the four powers and the navies of the European democracies they may be able to manipulate."

<p>US Government Organizes Large-Scale Hospitals</p>
<p>New York - US Army Surgeon General Magee said today that the US government is currently organizing large hospitals to serve in the United States or in overseas war zones in "national emergencies."

<p>Washington - Rear Admiral Towers, Undersecretary of the US Navy for Air, said before the Senate Naval Affairs Committee that of the 1,367 combat aircraft in the US Navy, only 192 were less than a year old, while the rest were up to seven years old. Yesterday, the committee refused to ban the publication of this statement, saying that the people of the whole country should know the truth.

<h3>Rumours Circulate that the US Will Re-establish the National Defence Committee, and that the Secretaries of the Army and Navy May Be Replaced</h3>
<p>Washington - Rumours have been rife in recent days about the revival of the National Defence Committee. Some political figures even believe that President Roosevelt will give a speech announcing the matter (the US government established the National Defence Committee in 1916 to coordinate defence programs in times of emergency). In addition, it is rumored that the government will soon replace the Secretaries of the Army and Navy. (Havas, 25th)</p>
<h3>US Official in Philippines Denounces Aggression, America's Great Undertaking is to Help Rebuild Europe</h3>
<p>Manila - Sayre, the US High Commissioner to the Philippines, recently gave a speech at the Chamber of Commerce, denouncing Germany's violation of human principles and justice, and stating that America's undertaking is to help rebuild Europe after the war. Sayre vigorously denounced force as the creator of chaos and degradation, saying that human culture based on law and order, built by centuries of heroic effort and sacrifice, has now been violated by organized and armed aggression, extreme barbarity, and contempt for human principles and justice. America's great undertaking will be to help rebuild a peaceful Europe with capital and raw materials, with new ideas and new methods, to establish humanitarianism, and to create unlimited international trade.

<h3>Soviet Ambassador Maisky Visits British Foreign Office, Trade Talks Between the Two Countries Possible</h3>
<p>London - Soviet Ambassador Maisky visited the British Foreign Office last night. According to Reuters diplomatic correspondent, it seems reasonable to believe that Foreign Secretary Butler's statement in the House of Commons two days ago that the British government is taking active steps to improve relations with the Soviet Union indicates that the recent Soviet note is considered to have opened the door to the possibility of trade talks. In this situation, the British government may obtain the consent of the Soviet government to send Sir Stafford Cripps, a leader of the British left wing, to Moscow, with a mission to determine what kind of basis can be obtained for engaging in trade negotiations.

<h3>US Senator Proposes Authorizing President to Help European Countries that Have Been Invaded</h3>
<p>Washington - Senator Pepper today introduced a resolution in the Senate asking President Roosevelt to be authorized to provide the Allied forces with all assistance they need for the war, stating that Germany has violated the Kellogg-Briand Pact. This assistance should include selling US aircraft, ships, heavy artillery, and other military supplies to Britain, France, Austria, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Denmark, Norway, the Netherlands, Belgium, and other countries that have been unjustly invaded by Germany in disregard of the Kellogg Pact and international law.

Great panic ensued, and reinforcements were sent from Jin and Bo to launch a large-scale counterattack. The fighting was extremely fierce. By the 22nd, the area had once fallen into Japanese hands, but Hua reinforcements rushed to the scene, fighting bloodily and repeatedly. Although the Japanese forces stubbornly resisted from fortified positions, they were ultimately unable to sustain due to excessive losses.

After fierce fighting until 2:00 PM, more than 1,000 Japanese reinforcements rushed from Jincheng, combined with the original more than 2,000 Japanese soldiers, and launched a fierce counterattack, but ultimately failed. A certain unit of the Hua army completely cut off the communication between the Japanese army in Jincheng and Zhoucun Town. Furthermore, the Japanese forces who invaded Xunwang Village, Dongbao, and Hanzhuang from Quwo and Jiangxian on the 20th were intercepted by the Hua army in different routes, suffering heavy casualties.

<h3>Zhenyue Air Route Negotiations; In Progress</h3>
<p>Chongqing: According to news from transportation circles here, negotiations are currently underway to expand the French airline route from French Vietnam to Jianming. The air route in this plan will be operated by the French company. Currently, the terminus of the company's Far East air route is Hanoi. The plan to open this new air route was initially announced last spring, but was soon shelved. In order to quickly realize this plan, the French consul in Kunming, Cribin, recently visited the Yunnan provincial authorities with officials from the French airline to discuss the matter. It is heard that the opening date of this new air route will soon be announced. This move will create a direct air route between the interior of China and Western Europe, parallel to the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway. Currently, there are China Aviation Corporation planes flying between Chongqing and Hanoi every week. (Reuter's Telegraph of the 25th)</p>
<p>Chongqing: According to officials of the airline flying between Hanoi and Kunming, regardless of how serious the French situation is, traffic on this air route will continue to be maintained as usual. According to transportation circles, negotiations on opening a new air route are very close, and this new route may be realized soon. The French Consul in Kunming, Cribin, and representatives of the airline flying between Hanoi and Kunming, discussed technical issues with the Yunnan Provincial authorities this week, intending to set the route of this air route to be parallel to the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway. With the completion of this route, there will be one more transportation line between China and Europe. (Associated Press Telegraph of the 25th)</p>

<h3>The Scenery of Three Capitals During Wartime in Europe (III); The Contrast Between Paris and Berlin Before the Great War on the Western Front</h3>
<p>Even in large stores filled with shoppers, it is very quiet inside. Shops selling women's accessories, jewelry, treasures, silk, and all kinds of luxury goods are well-stocked, while other goods are mostly sold out. The clothes on sale are marked with prices and percentages, and shoppers are more interested in the reduction of the specified percentage points than the marked selling price. The display windows of the shops are full of all kinds of new goods, but if you want to buy one or two of the same kind, the shop assistant tells you that it is only for "decoration." In Germany, the authorities are holding up the facade, but the displays in the windows cause some Germans to doubt whether the wartime storage is adequately displayed.</p>
<p>Paris is lively, with lots of noise and convenient transportation. The street lights are only turned over a little, many door lights are on, and many curtains are casually drawn. The city does not implement a quota system, which shows that there is no shortage of goods. The method of food restriction is very simple, stipulating that certain goods are not allowed to be sold on certain days. There is no meat to eat for three days a week, and no noodles, wine, or candy for the other few days. Although the French are particular about food, they just shrug their shoulders at this kind of restriction, unlike the Germans who discuss eating and drinking all the time. German housewives spend a lot of time looking for food. Their sense of smell is very sensitive. If a merchant obtains food that is not subject to quota restrictions, such as nuts or oranges, as soon as they display this kind of thing, countless German ladies will flock to them.</p>
<p>The fatigue of war exists between the two countries. For seven years, Germany has been preparing for war without rest. By the last moment, their effectiveness and patience had reached their peak. As far as the soldiers are concerned, they are actually better than the civilian forces. A young engineer said when his family praised him for his radiant appearance: "I have plenty of rest and good food on the front line." But the production of civilian factories and fields is stagnant. Neither stimulation nor punishment can make the soldiers on this second line work harder. In fact, they are too tired. Women are exhausted from cooking without rice. In some places, it is said that children are also getting tired. Teachers in schools are unable to make them interested in "My Struggle" and all Nazi ideology.</p>
<p>We all have a feeling that the revolution of the National Socialist Party is gradually coming to an end, becoming extremely radical on the one hand and expressing boredom and the disappearance of illusions on the other. If it were not for this war, this trend would be even more obvious. But the war has forged the Nazis and anti-Nazis into one. They have been constantly propagandizing that Britain is going to smash Germany, so everyone is rising up to fight against foreign enemies, becoming the country's military force. The people hope for peace even more eagerly than the French. Most people believe that if a large-scale war cannot be avoided, then Germany will definitely win. We can often hear them say: "Everything will be over in August, and our difficulties will come to an end."</p>
<p>In France, no one dares to predict the end of the war. France believes that he will eventually win, and does not say that this war is short and easy. The German government's intention seems to be to divert people's attention so that they do not feel the danger. In fact, so far, Berlin has not experienced the fear of being bombed. The Paris government seems to want the people to understand that war is not child's play and that danger can come at any time. The French believe that this is right, but they do not want to panic. If the Germans do not try their best to the limit, the French will not make a concerted effort. The strangest thing is that this war has not caused great excitement on either side. Berlin is acting slowly and depressed, with a vast future and no way to end. Paris's mood and expression are relatively relaxed, but the heart is not so. The Germans see nothing in the dark under the blackout. The French see too clearly in the dim light. (Translated from the New York Times)</p>

<h3>Production Education Expenses for the 29th Year; The Executive Yuan, 1.2 Million Yuan; The Ministry of Education Has Distributed Separately</h3>
<p>(Chongqing Telegraph of the 25th) The production education expenses were originally 800,000 yuan per year. Recently, the Executive Yuan meeting approved the production education expenses for the 29th year, increasing them by 400,000 yuan, which has been distributed by the Ministry of Education as follows: (1) 140,000 yuan to subsidize production funds for vocational schools in various regions. (2) 120,000 yuan to subsidize salary allowances for technical teachers in vocational schools. (3) 120,000 yuan to subsidize internship material fees for vocational schools. The Ministry of Education has established detailed measures for the above three subsidies. The remaining 10,000 yuan has been ordered by the Executive Yuan to be used to subsidize various agricultural vocational schools in Sichuan Province.</p>
<h3>The Ministry of Education Re-Orders Schools in the Rear; Pay Attention to Students' Health</h3>
<p>(Chongqing Telegraph of the 25th) The Ministry of Education previously stated that most of the schools at all levels in the war zone that have moved to the rear are lacking in equipment and makeshift due to funding issues, which affects the health of students. It was ordered to pay special attention to it. Now, the Ministry believes that a small number of schools have failed to comply, and has re-emphasized the previous order, ordering strict compliance.</p>
<h3>Guo Yubu; Academic Review Meeting</h3>
<p>(Chongqing Airmail) The Academic Review Committee of the Ministry of Education held a meeting on May 12th. The attendees included Minister Chen Lifu, Vice Ministers Gu and Yu, and Committee Members Zhu Jiahua, Chen Daqi, Guo Renyuan, Wang Shijie, Cheng Tianfang, Luo Jialun, Zhang Daofan, Yan Fuqing, Zeng Yangfu, Fu Sinian, Feng Youlan, Zou Shuwen, Ma Dehan, Teng Gu, Wu Junsheng, and 18 other people. They approved the main points of the regulations on the review of qualifications of teachers in universities and independent colleges, the main points of the regulations on the appointment and treatment of teachers in universities and independent colleges, the connection of work between various research institutes, and the cases of subsidizing the study of Bi Shu and rewarding writing inventions. That evening, all committee members attended a reception hosted by the Central Party Headquarters. The news of the victory in Southern Henan arrived. Secretary-General Ye Chucang delivered a speech, stating that the great plan of resisting the war and building the country is like the two wings of a bird. One wing is military, and the other wing is education. The President once said that our country has absolute confidence in military victory. The victory in Southern Henan has been confirmed. This wing is no longer a problem. As for the other wing of education, it has also made great progress, thanks to the leadership of the gentlemen. Subsequently, Committee Member Feng Youlan delivered a thank-you speech, stating that the two wings alluded to by Mr. Ye originally meant one civil and one military. The ancient proverb said, "Civil can secure the country, and military can pacify the country," which is the meaning. The progress in the military aspect has already been made clear to everyone. As for the educational aspect, I am afraid that it cannot be as progressive as the military. Although this is affected by environmental constraints, those of us engaged in education cannot help but feel ashamed. In the future, under the leadership of our party, we should work harder to complete the mission of building the country. They dispersed happily at nine o'clock. Since the bills had not yet been fully discussed, the meeting was scheduled to continue the next day.</p>
<h3>St. John's University Alumni Association; Held a Parents' Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Branch of the St. John's University Alumni Association held its annual parents' meeting at the alma mater in Fanwangdu at 2:00 PM on the 25th. Many alumni in Shanghai attended with their wives and children, attracting more than 3,000 people, which was quite a grand occasion for a time. A temporary stage was set up on the lawn of the large playground, with the Chinese and American flags hanging on the left and right, and the St. John's school flag, which read "Learning without thinking is useless, and thinking without learning is dangerous," hanging in the middle. Various kinds of beautiful and elegant flowers were displayed in front of the stage. The meeting started at 3:00 PM. First, the alumni team and the faculty team played a small soccer game. After President Bu Fangji kicked off the ball, the game began. After 30 minutes, the game ended in a 1-1 tie. Next was the 50-yard race, which gathered hundreds of boys and girls brought by the alumni, who were divided into more than a dozen groups according to age and gender. Some of the youngest six-year-old boys and girls stood still in the middle of the field when the race started, not knowing what to do, which was the most laughable. Afterwards, more than a dozen Chinese and Western old professors also participated in the 50-yard race, which showed that the spirit of the old is still strong. Next was the needle threading competition. Dozens of men and women held the ends of the needle and thread and stood up. They were divided into two groups. The winner was the one who could run to the female side and thread the needle and return the fastest. This involved the use of hands, eyes, body, and steps, which won a lot of applause from the audience. The winners of the above two competitions were awarded prizes separately. Then they gathered in front of the stage for a meeting, and the rituals were performed as usual. First, the president of the association, Ou Weiguo, delivered a welcome speech to the alumni, followed by President Bu Fangji's speech. Then they sang the school song, followed by representatives of alumni from the classes of 1900, 1910, 1920, 1930, and 1940 taking the stage one after another to give speeches and performances. There were also children dancing, and harmonica solos, Western music, and piano solos by alumni. Then Cai Hezhang delivered the closing speech, and finally, the students in the school performed a comical drama of "Wu Huang Testing Characters" to add to the fun. One person dressed up as a character testing master, and four other male and female students each picked a character, which combined to form the four characters "Yi Jian Sheng Cai" (making a fortune at first sight). They asked the character testing master to analyze them, intentionally making things difficult, which made people laugh. The performance lasted until evening, and the alumni dispersed happily.</p>
<h3>The Ministry of Education Sends Personnel to Inspect; All National Colleges and Universities Above Junior College; Have Set Off on Different Routes</h3>
<p>(Chongqing Airmail) In order to improve the teaching facilities of national colleges and universities above junior college, the Ministry of Education sent Chen Shizhen, Zhou Jianhou, Hao Gengsheng, Lin Guangmao, Xu Langming, Chen Panzao, Zhang Yi, Zhang Beihai, Meng Shouchun, Zhou Xianwen, Tai Shuangqiu, and Wang Wenhua to inspect the national colleges and universities above junior college separately, so as to urge improvement and respond. It is heard that the members have set off separately to inspect.</p>
<h3>The Ministry of Education Subsidizes; Dry Batteries for Various Provinces</h3>
<p>(Chongqing Airmail) The Ministry of Education pays special attention to radio education in various provinces, and provides subsidies based on investigations. For neighboring Sichuan, Kang, Qian, Xiang, and Hubei provinces, the Ministry will allocate and distribute existing goods from dry battery factories. For Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Guangdong, Guangxi, Fujian, Yunnan, and Henan provinces, where batteries can be purchased locally, the Ministry will allocate cash for local purchases. For Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, and Qinghai provinces, where transportation is difficult and there are no battery factories, the Ministry will allocate additional funds to assist in setting up battery factories to meet needs. It has been notified separately. It is heard that the Ministry's principle for subsidizing batteries for remote and impoverished provinces is to assume that each radio needs three sets of dry batteries per year. The central government will subsidize one set, and the province and local governments will each bear one set. In addition, the Ministry-run battery factories sell at low prices, and educational institutions in each province that install radios can submit a request to the Ministry to introduce and prioritize purchases.</p>

<h3>Police Spring Games; Fang Saiga Set; New Shanghai Record in 100 Yards Yesterday; Bo's Shot Put Also Broke Record; Fang Saiga Won Six Championships; Wang Zhenglin First in Two Miles</h3>
<p>The 30th Public Concession Police Games held its finals yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM at the Racecourse. No less than 5,000 spectators attended. The Police Force Military Band came to the venue to play, and the situation was extremely enthusiastic. In the open events, Edward set a new Shanghai record in the 100-yard race, with a time of 10 seconds flat, breaking his own old record of 10.2 seconds. Achieving this result on the grass is the biggest harvest of the conference. In the two-mile team race, Wang Zhenglin of Hongkou Jia was the first to reach the finish line. Guan Youwen and Wan Jinsheng took second and third place, but unfortunately Wang Shiying fell behind, and the championship was won by Dong Selai. The second was Xifusi, and Hongkou Jia came in third. Jacko Bodimeike won the 440-yard and 1-mile championships respectively. In the tug-of-war, Xifusi Jia and Yi both won the right to the finals. The Jia team overwhelmed the Yi team and won the championship. In the invitation race, the relay race of different distances belonged to Xiqing, and the school relay race belonged to Saint Francis. Fang Saiga of the Xibu team also won four championships in the 100-yard two events, 220-yard, and 880-yard, for a total of six championships since last Saturday. Boluoke Luofeifu also set a new Shanghai record in the 16-pound shot put, with a score of 43 feet 3 inches, breaking Mantuo Lies's old record of 42 feet 11 and a half inches, which is comparable to Edward. Sun Zhichong won three championships in the Chinese police chief, deputy police chief, and secretary group. The stilt race in disguise was laughable. As a result, the Chinese police won first place. The equestrian performance was still a novelty in Shanghai and was twice as interesting. Xifusi's talents were average, and he dominated the competition. After the game, Mrs. Bowen presented the awards and closed the ceremony.</p>

<h3>Finance: Foreign Exchange Sellers Still Dominate</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw no change in exchange rates. The black market for British and American exchange rates was unusually quiet, resulting in minimal fluctuations. Due to Saturday's half-day trading, transactions were even more scarce. The trend was stable with a slight hardening, but news of the European war remained scarce in terms of positive developments. Buyers often lowered their bids, but sellers were willing to sell cheaply. In the morning, the Yokohama Specie Bank offered May futures of US dollars at 5.53125 yuan, but there were no takers. Speculators then released them at 5.5625 yuan, and the Yokohama Specie Bank had to sell at that price. At closing, the British pound remained unchanged at 4 pence 140625, and the US dollar closed at 5.5625 yuan, a hardening of 0.03125. The futures market showed no clear winners or losers.</p>

HSBC's listed prices remained unchanged. The silver balance tax was revealed to have increased slightly by 3.75%. After this, the market was very quiet. Until the noon close, transactions were rare.

<h3>Supply and Demand for Foreign Currencies</h3>

The supply of British and American gold pounds was relatively strong, and the market price fell by one yuan. The supply and demand for British gold notes were balanced, and the market price was stable. The US dollar note only fluctuated by a few cents, eventually reaching 17.85 yuan.

The Money Trade Association's interbank lending rate was listed at 0.7 cents in both the morning and afternoon markets, a flattening.</p>
<h3>Speculative Interest Wanes: Gold Market Peaceful</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cash gold black market was peaceful, a rare sight in the recent gold market. The reason was that foreign exchange was stable and flat, and operators' interest waned. Large players watched the development of the environment and then determined their buying and selling plans. The day began with 5,800 yuan in the morning, 15 yuan lower than the previous day. Although it soon rose by five yuan, the money exchange industry suddenly came to sell, and the price was pushed down to 5,765 yuan due to the difficulty in finding buyers. Later, thanks to the considerable absorption by securities firms, it rebounded to 5,800 yuan, but the result was only 5,786 yuan, a decrease of 29 yuan compared to the previous day. The market was closed in the afternoon due to Saturday, and there were few transactions in the half-day, around 1,300 taels. Jewelry gold was initially flat, then listed down by 10 yuan. Customs gold and others remained flat.</p>
<p>Gold Falls by 29 Yuan</p>
<p>Since the beginning of the morning, the exchange market for each bar (10 taels) was slightly longer, and people were tired. It immediately fell by 15 yuan after opening. A gold shop issued 10 taels to a securities firm for 5,800 yuan. Subsequently, a certain bank absorbed slightly, rising back by five yuan. Twenty taels were entered into a jewelry store for 5,805 yuan. Due to the continuous issuance from the money exchange industry, but the lack of buyers at that time, it fell again by 40 yuan. The money exchange sold 10 taels to a bank for 5,765 yuan. Fortunately, a certain money exchange industry turned from selling to buying, and other sellers stopped selling to wait and see. The price gradually turned upward, and then relied on a securities firm to absorb it frequently, rebounding to the 5,800 yuan mark. Securities firms entered a total of 30 taels into jewelry stores for 5,800 yuan. After this, because buyers stopped their activities, and banks came to sell slightly, it went down again. A money exchange industry entered 20 taels of gold into a gold shop for 5,786 yuan, as the noon closing price. As a result, it continued to fall by 29 yuan compared to the previous day. The up and down range for the half-day was 40 yuan. The selling price of cash gold in the gold shop was several yuan higher than the smelting cost, and the purchase price was reduced by 20 yuan. The current standard gold抵was 50 yuan more than the listed gold, and there were few transactions.</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold Listed Down by 10 Yuan</p>
<p>The initial price of jewelry gold for each tael was still 600 yuan by Datong Bank. Until noon, it was listed down by 10 yuan, and there were no changes after that. As a result, Datong Bank changed the listing to 590 yuan. The new bank was the same as the above price, and the purchase was reduced by 30 yuan.</p>
<h3>Grains: Foreign Rice Stockpiles Overflow - Most of the Market is Pessimistic</h3>
<p>The rice market was tired first and then tight yesterday. The late-night market trend turned sluggish, and people's hearts were shaken. The morning opening heard the news of gold falling and exchange rates loosening, which made people feel even more exhausted. Everyone tried to sell. Those who made a profit had already come out first, and the original root traders sold lightly later, and it was immediately seen to be sluggish. The general guests saw the weakness of the trend, and they were also panicked and did not dare to enter suddenly. Although the market price fell again and again, the sales field felt stagnant. By the middle of the market, the price of each commodity had fallen close to yuan. If No. 1 Chen Saigon only sold for 51 yuan, No. 2 for 48.56 yuan, fire-ground for 49.23 yuan, No. 2 Siam and Small Grain for 48.2 yuan. At this point, it was barely able to stand, and the color of hesitation appeared all the way. It often fluctuated up and down by 2 or 3 yuan. Until near noon, the gold price rose again, attracting customers from the mainland, Ningbo, and Shaoxing to purchase at a low price, and floating hoarders absorbed it, and then the shouts began to rise, the price rose again, and the original position was restored, showing a situation of no glory or disgrace.</p>
<p>The spot price of foreign rice generally showed a softening trend yesterday. Saigon small-ground, Min Party, and fire grain all saw a reduction of 3 to 5 yuan. It was still difficult to cheer up in the afternoon. The stockpiles in the market were abundant, and the actual sales were flat. Before the Mid-Autumn Festival, all households in the countryside lacked a good appetite. Yinghua Company's original package of No. 1 Saigon, which was reported to be imported, also only opened at 59 yuan. Only those that can be reported for re-export are rare in the market. Yesterday, Xiamen, Shantou, and other gangs searched hard. There were 50 tons that were raised to 65 yuan and traded. The appetite for inland shipments has weakened, and a total of more than 5,000 bags have been traded.</p>
<p>Also, it was reported that another 2,574 bags of foreign rice arrived in Shanghai yesterday, which were loaded from Hong Kong by the Taikoo Qingyuan round.</p>
<p>Corn is constantly being transported north. Today, there are another 700 bags that will be transported to Yantai by the Nanning round. It is said that there are still 10,000 bags waiting to be transported to North China. (Grandfather)</p>
<p>Although the arrival of japonica and glutinous domestic rice was limited yesterday, only 1,000 to 2,000 bags, the market was small and smooth, echoing each other, whether it was the official market inside the venue or the black market transaction outside the venue.</p>
<h3>The Issue of Damaged Banknotes</h3>
<p>— Chen Xinkui</p>
<p>Recently, several major banks have refused to accept damaged banknotes unless they undergo a special procedure, such as recording the serial numbers and preparing a list, before they can be accepted at a designated location. This practice was initially implemented between banks and large commercial firms with frequent transactions. Later, some stores, finding it difficult to deposit money into banks, also restricted the acceptance of damaged banknotes in their retail businesses. Recently, even post offices have politely refused damaged banknotes.</p>
<p>It is said that the banks' original intention was "deliberately damaging banknotes to avoid exchange." What is considered deliberate damage? Any brand-new banknote that is intentionally torn into two, three, or four pieces, and then glued together with paper, regardless of whether the joints are close and secure, is considered deliberate damage. However, the definition of "deliberate" is quite difficult to clarify. If someone maliciously tears off a corner of a new banknote, it is of course "deliberate." But if someone accidentally burns a hole in a banknote with a cigarette, it is clearly unintentional from an objective point of view. However, from a subjective point of view, whoever burns the hole is responsible. Unintentional must also be considered "deliberate." Moreover, newly glued banknotes are not generally used, so old banknotes that have been patched up are naturally even less usable. In addition, the scope of "damage" also varies. Tearing a banknote in half is "damage," but is it not also "damage" to have frayed edges or a corner torn off? The meaning of "deliberate" is ambiguous, and the degree of "damage" is uncertain. The recipient's judgment of damaged banknotes lacks a standard. For the sake of caution, they have to refuse any banknote with even the slightest damage. In this way, "caution" becomes "nitpicking." The result of "nitpicking" is that the scope of circulation of old and damaged banknotes is becoming narrower and narrower. People who hold old and damaged banknotes feel particularly inconvenient. Especially when there is only one damaged banknote left in their pocket, and the goods have already been purchased, or the dim sum has already been eaten, they are suddenly rejected at the checkout counter. The embarrassment and annoyance at that time are indeed unbearable, so verbal arguments and conflicts are often unavoidable.</p>
<p>Banks refusing to accept damaged banknotes has considerable grounds and reasons: First, since damaged banknotes already have designated exchange locations, the parts that perform other functions have reasons to refuse damaged banknotes to save time. Second, the cost of printing banknotes is quite high. For example, a single-yuan banknote used to cost about ten cents when prices were cheap. Now that everything is expensive, the cost of banknote paper, printing, and other expenses has also increased several times. Imagine a perfectly good new banknote that could originally be used for at least 20 years is suddenly intentionally damaged, greatly shortening its durable life. Wouldn't the bank issuing the banknote suffer a great loss? To warn those who do not know how to cherish public property, is it not very appropriate to refuse to exchange intentionally damaged banknotes?</p>
<p>Probably due to a lack of knowledge and disregard for public morality, many people use banknotes without any care at all: some people fold banknotes into blocks like dried tofu, some people roll banknotes into cigarette rolls, some people squeeze banknotes into wads of waste paper, some people grab the large and small banknotes they get back and stuff them into their pockets, making a complete mess. In addition, zealous believers add "Believe in Jesus Quickly" stamps to the edges of banknotes, speculators add slogans for "Frostbite Ointment" in the blank spaces, accounting clerks stamp the name and logo of their shops on the watermark, and rambling poets inscribe beautiful lines like "When Will You Return?" on the surface of banknotes. Future bank magnates add their private signatures and seals next to the original signature in a crooked and slanted fashion. In short, a very complete banknote is messed up and scribbled on by many frivolous people, intentionally or unintentionally, leaving it battered and scarred beyond recognition. It's really terrible.</p>
<p>Things in the world are often unfair. The troublemakers are often not the ones who suffer, but a different kind of people suffer. There is another kind of people who not only do not suffer but can also benefit from others' trouble. For example, people who intentionally damage banknotes have certainly already spent the damaged banknotes. Those who receive the damaged banknotes are often well-meaning gentlemen who disdain to quibble over every penny. Those who receive unexpected benefits are a group of "specialists in collecting damaged banknotes with special discounts on fares" tobacconists. Currently, the amount of floating capital in Shanghai and its surrounding areas is said to be 300 billion yuan. Assuming that one-sixth of it is cash, and 5% of the cash is damaged banknotes, then there are already 25 million yuan worth of damaged banknotes. Further assuming that each yuan of damaged banknotes requires a discount of 5 cents when exchanged at tobacconists, then the discount loss for the well-meaning gentlemen would be a whopping 1.25 million yuan. Based on everyone's experience, the banknotes that come in and out daily are mostly half-new banknotes, followed by damaged banknotes, and the fewest are brand-new banknotes. Since everyone has been strictly checking banknotes, the gap left by damaged banknotes has not been filled for a while, resulting in a shortage of chips in the market, especially the lack of single-yuan banknotes. It is said that the exchange rate for every 1,000 single-yuan banknotes has risen by more than 2 yuan. From this, it can be seen that the damaged yuan banknotes circulating in the Shanghai area must quickly be beyond 25 million yuan. No wonder the red-letter signs of tobacconists collecting damaged banknotes are like the "Seasonal Spring Pancakes" signs of New Year's cake stalls, and more and more people are hanging them up.</p>
<p>Among the damaged banknotes that are collected by banks, there must be many banknotes that can still be used. When the market needs chips in the future, will these damaged banknotes that are still usable be re-issued? Also, since the people who currently hold damaged banknotes are mostly innocent well-meaning gentlemen, can the bank's method of collecting damaged banknotes be improved somewhat, or can the locations for collecting damaged banknotes be increased and made more widespread, so that innocent people can reduce a bit of unexpected loss and pain? (End)</p>
<h3>Difficult Southern Shipping: Limited Flour Transactions</h3>
<p>The flour market trade is quiet. Northern flour sales have been quiet for a long time, and Southern port sales face transportation difficulties, hindering completion of previous orders. New deals are carefully watched. A limited number of batch deals are relied upon. Dealers from the mainland moved to purchase Wuxi flour, with Sunfeng, Shanlu, and Shuangshi brands shipped in volume. Reports claim prices have risen at the source, with limited remaining stock available for shipment to Shanghai, creating exclusivity. Selling prices are close to factory prices, instilling fear in importers, leading to a sustained stalemate. Recycled flour from old mills is also in a stalemate. Market breathing will depend on the new wheat harvest. 6,500 bags will be shipped to Hong Kong on the 26th.</p>
<h3>Oilcakes: Controlling the Oil Market, Rising After a Fall</h3>
<p>Recently, the bean oil market has been very quiet due to extremely sluggish sales in all markets and a continuous stream of sources, resulting in overflowing stockpiles (approximately 8,000 barrels of barrel oil and 7,000 pieces of basket oil). The overall situation is stagnant, relying solely on manipulators to forcibly support it. However, part of the Dalian Oil Company cooperative had different ideas. The market suddenly reversed yesterday, with Dalian oil implementing a price cut. The morning closing price was 5 yuan lower than the previous day at 85 yuan. In the afternoon, the company held an emergency meeting to implement forced measures. The market immediately returned to its original price of 90 yuan, announcing a transaction volume of 200 barrels. Others only opened 130 pieces of Yanzhi oil at the original price of 62 yuan.</p>
<p>Twenty-six days will transport 23 bags of Jiu Bai beans to Xianggang Port and 320 cans of tea oil and 2,993 cans of crude oil to Xianggang Port on the same day.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Current Yarn Sales in Guangdong Are Still Good</h3>
<p>The yarn market continues to decline, and the situation is softening due to the intensity of the European war, which has made people tired. However, the current yarn sales market is still relatively strong, with sporadic purchases from Hong Kong continuing unabated, so the downward trend can be reversed considerably.</p>
<p>The morning opening of the current yarn was still peaceful. Due to the continued unremitting demand for Double Horse from Hong Kong, popularity was stable. The price of 20-count Double Horse was 1,295 yuan, lower than the previous day's price. It was rumored that foreign exchange and gold prices were flat, and there were many floating profits, so the market situation tended to decline, falling to 2,210 yuan. After the price was low, it triggered short covering, gradually rising back. The result was a closing price of 1,230 yuan. The statistics for half-day transactions totaled 1,835 bales. The market for Double Horse fell by 50 yuan. Today, 557 pieces of cotton yarn will be transported to Hong Kong. The amount purchased by each gang is listed below:</p>
<p>Yunnan 330, Hong Kong 905</p>
<p>Same Industry 560, Statistics 1,835</p>
<p>Local cotton transactions were particularly rare. Business was even quieter at the end of the month. There were only two transactions among the same industry: Oumula flower at 205 yuan for 100 pieces and La flower at 206 yuan for 100 pieces, both warehouse transactions.</p>
<p>The market price of foreign cotton, the New York cotton market, showed a lively market situation from the beginning of the morning. Later, due to the purchase by the public and the short covering of some, the closing market price rose by more than 30 pounds compared to the previous day. The situation in India was very average. Yesterday, including the forecast, there was not much change.</p>
<p>The trade of foreign cotton in Shanghai was more active. However, transactions between some manufacturers and the same industry were few. The Tianjin gang was very interested in purchasing, but due to tight credit, they could only stand by. However, the general opinion is that after the end of the month, credit may loosen, and the Tianjin gang will become more active. The following is the cotton market yesterday, converted at a rate of 5.5 yuan for the US dollar, the futures delivery price to the factory:</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Cloth Market Weak, Buyers Hesitant</h3>
<p>Due to the settlement of many futures contracts this month, the cloth market saw increased selling pressure, causing prices to decline. Sellers' asking prices varied greatly, leading to a state of confusion. Market sentiment was weak, and buyers hesitated, resulting in sluggish sales. Fine cloth, fine twill, and coarse cloth continued to fall by 2.5 to 5 cents per bolt. Bleached and dyed cloth fell by 5 cents. Local dealers transacted over 200 deals. Sales were uniformly slow at both retail stores and for out-of-town customers. With continuous price declines, buyers adopted a wait-and-see attitude to avoid losses, only purchasing small quantities of urgently needed goods. On the 26th, 300 bolts of piece goods were shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Eastern cloth prices fell initially and then rose. The morning opening saw continued pressure as the new futures contracts for this month were due for settlement on the 27th, and yesterday was the last day. Bulls reluctantly liquidated their positions, leading to a sharp decline. Twelve-pound "Dragon Head" fine cloth once fell to $37.25, and "Four Gentlemen" woolen serge fell below the one-dollar mark, with the lowest price at 99 cents per yard. Later, due to stable exchange rates and firm cash positions, buyers from Qinhuangdao and Tianjin showed strong interest. Local dealers' sentiment turned bullish, and the market gradually stabilized with tighter bidding. The after-market saw "Dragon Head" fine cloth trading at $39.50, and woolen serge at $1.0325.</p>
<h3>Securities: Domestic Bond Market Quiet</h3>
<p>The securities market yesterday was relatively firm. Trading volume was about 200,000 in the morning, but only 60,000 in the afternoon, a negligible amount, indicating a generally stagnant market. Significant changes in the environment were brewing, and gold and foreign exchange showed extreme dullness. However, a drastic change is likely not far off and should not be ignored. In the morning trading, Tongyu Agency No. 4 sold Class A shares, which were bought by Datong. Hu Heji Agency sold Class B shares, which were bought by Zhenkang. The rest were sporadic transactions, with intermittent buying and selling. The afternoon was extremely quiet. Only Tiansheng bought 20,000 Class E shares and No. 7 bought 25,000 Class C shares. The rest saw only 15,000 in scattered transactions. Prices were firmer in the afternoon. Class B shares were unchanged, while others rose slightly by one or two cents. The total trading volume was approximately $300,000. A summary table is provided below.</p>
<p>Stock trading: 100 shares of Dada Steamship Company were traded at a price of $71.</p>
<p>London, 24th (Friday) – The quoted prices for Chinese external debt remain stable with no changes in the prices of various bonds.</p>
<p>London, 24th (Friday) – The quoted prices for British Far East company stocks show that HSBC shares continue to rise. Shares registered in the UK rose by £2.5 to £82.5, and shares registered in Hong Kong rose by £1.5 to £84. The rest showed minor fluctuations.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Coarse White Slightly Tight, Red Sugar Weak</h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market saw mixed movements. The guild's market price showed more entries for spot 24 coarse white sugar, which was slightly tighter. Foreign warehouse goods were at $66 to $65.5, up by 5 cents. Transshipment goods arriving on June 1st were at $53.5 to $53.3, and warehouse receipts for goods arriving on May 28th were at $52.5 to $52.3. Taikoo White B was still at $4.81. Red sugar was weak, with H-marked carmine at approximately $55 and Dutch red sugar at approximately $58, both at average prices. It was heard that the National Sugar refinery was offering Fang Diao Qing at $62, with some sales. The quotation board remained inactive, and demand was very weak. Father Sugar arrived from Hong Kong with 895 bags yesterday.</p>
<h3>Coal: Hongji Small Coal, Ample Spot Supply</h3>
<p>Hongji No. 1 small coal was in short supply last week, and sales were brisk. Dealers' prices had risen as high as $238 per ton, exceeding the price of lump coal. Recently, as hoarders released large quantities, spot supply suddenly became ample, and prices fell. More than 100 tons were traded on the market yesterday at a price of around $210. The engine room transported the coal themselves, with extra charges for handling.</p>
<h3>Dried Goods: Longan Meat Shortage Eases</h3>
<p>Recently, shipments of dried longan meat from Xiamen, Tong'an, Guangdong, and Hong Kong have been scarce, resulting in a dwindling market supply. Shortages have become more pronounced, and market prices have risen considerably. Yesterday's market price for sun-dried meat ranged from $180 down to $160 to $120, depending on quality.</p>
<h3>Fragrant Sunflower Seeds Fall by $5</h3>
<p>The previous high price for Tianjin fragrant sunflower seeds had reached $41. Recently, due to increased arrivals, prices have fallen back. It is heard that Tianjin traders released 200 bags at a price of $36, a drop of $5.</p>
<h3>Medicinal Materials: Continued Arrival of Tangerine Peel</h3>
<p>Previously, tangerine peel was scarce, and demand was increasing, so prices had risen by one or two dollars. It has been discovered that the Taikoo Company's Guangdong-bound ship from Xiamen has continued to arrive with dozens more pieces, and it can be shipped within a few days. The market appears to be slightly loosening.</p>
<h3>Hardware: Tinplate, Water Bottle Factories Make Limited Purchases</h3>
<p>The broadest sales for tinplate come from local water bottle factories, followed by Tianjin merchants and tin printing and can manufacturing factories. However, since the recent sharp drop in foreign exchange rates and the surge in prices, sales have been stagnant, and the market has been quiet. Yesterday, local water bottle factories suddenly showed interest, purchasing about one to two hundred boxes. Currently, local inventories are extremely low, and no new goods have arrived, so sellers have had to maintain firm prices. Huishi goods are selling for $170 per box, and standard 20-inch and 28-inch sheets are selling for $200 per box of 112 sheets.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Takes Necessary Measures: No Doubt About Security in the Concessions</h3>
<p>#### Elimination of Crime and Strengthening of Defense Proceed Simultaneously</p>
<p>#### British and American Troops Implement Close Cooperation</p>
<p>Although the current European war situation is extremely tense, the military authorities of various countries stationed in Shanghai have earnestly expressed their determination to maintain the status quo in this international market. Therefore, there are unlikely to be any changes in the situation in Shanghai. However, due to the tense situation, all relevant parties are paying close attention to security within the concessions. In addition to the troops stationed in Shanghai by the United Kingdom, the United States, and other countries doing their best to assist the concession authorities, the Shanghai Municipal Council has decided to rapidly increase the strength of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps and strengthen concession defenses. In addition, the Council held a meeting on the 15th of this month, at which a comprehensive discussion was held, and a report was submitted to the relevant authorities. Every effort will be made to improve the current situation and maintain security. It is rumored that the consular officials believe that the increase in criminal cases is due to the existence of "badlands." Therefore, they plan to make every effort to expel secret societies from the "badlands." However, according to reporters' investigations, this matter is not progressing smoothly due to the unique views of Japanese Consul-General Yoshiaki Miura. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Elimination of Crime in the Badlands: Japanese Consul Miura Has Ulterior Motives</h3>
<p>According to foreign sources, Japanese Consul-General Yoshiaki Miura's reasons for opposing the plan are twofold: (1) Interference by the Consular Body in activities in the extra-settlement areas is an overstepping of authority; and (2) There are more effective methods than expelling secret societies. Miura's so-called "more effective methods" refer to the rapid formation of strong and effective "special police" in the extra-settlement road areas. Miura believes that modern crime can be reduced by police officers constantly following and monitoring criminals. Therefore, he has repeatedly suggested that the organization of "special police" is now urgent, as this organization will be more effective than the existing police in the extra-settlement road areas.</p>
<h3>Repeated Negotiations Have Been Unfruitful</h3>
<p>According to neutral reports, since the signing of the "Police Agreement" for extra-settlement road construction, the Japanese unwillingness to give up their gambling tax has been a major obstacle to the realization of the "special police." The Japanese have repeatedly obstructed the final decision. Moreover, since Shanghai Municipal Police Commissioner Bowen made a "final suggestion" to the head of the puppet "Police Bureau," Lu Ying, he has not yet received a response from the puppet government. Therefore, the Consular Body requested the assistance of Japanese Consul Miura to expel special agents from western Shanghai. The Consular Body sent representatives to the Japanese intelligence agency several times last month to negotiate, but to no avail.</p>
<h3>All Gambling Dens to Be Eliminated Next Month</h3>
<p>According to reliable sources obtained yesterday morning, the eleven gambling dens currently operating in western Shanghai will all be closed in early June. It is said that the authorities have ordered the gambling dens to close several times in the past two months, but this has never been realized. The reason why the gambling dens will be closed again is that the "special police" in the extra-settlement road area are expected to be established next month. In the middle of last month, there were fourteen gambling dens in western Shanghai. Three announced their closure at the beginning of this month, so there are currently only eleven gambling dens.</p>
<h3>Strengthening the Strength of the Volunteer Corps: Cooperation Between Defense Forces of Various Countries</h3>
<p>The current situation in the International Settlement is very different from normal. The borders of all areas in the International Settlement, including Areas B, C, and D, are defended by troops stationed by the various countries in Shanghai. The area along the Bund in Area A is regularly defended by members of the White Russian detachment of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps. In addition to assisting the Shanghai Municipal Police to maintain security within the settlement, the corps also assists the British, American, and other military commanders stationed in Shanghai upon request. Therefore, the corps is in close cooperation with the defense forces of various countries and the Shanghai Municipal Police.</p>
<h3>Vacancies in the British Detachment Need to Be Filled Urgently</h3>
<p>There are still vacancies in the British Detachment of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps. As of recently, Company A has only 80 men, Company B has 100 men, the cavalry has 70 men, the armored car detachment has 90 men, the engineering detachment has 50 men, the air defense detachment has 60 men, and the Scottish Company has 70 men. All are insufficient, and there are many vacancies, which need to be filled urgently. After the British Consulate-General issued a notice on the 20th of this month, advising its nationals to join the Shanghai Volunteer Corps, many British nationals have joined. However, the number of people who have joined has not yet been able to fill the vacancies.</p>
<h3>Norwegian Nationals Enthusiastically Join</h3>
<p>The Jewish Detachment has increased rapidly. With the large-scale arrival of Jewish refugees in Shanghai, there are many who have joined the Shanghai Volunteer Corps. The detachment also had many vacancies. Recently, it has increased to 115 men, only five short of the original quota. Company C originally had only 20 men left. Since the outbreak of the European war, nationals of Nordic countries such as Norway and Sweden have enthusiastically joined the company. It has recently increased by 40 men, reaching approximately 60 men. In addition, the White Russian mercenary detachment has recently been filled to its full strength of 360 men.</p>
<h3>Ample Military Supplies, Complete Equipment</h3>
<p>According to recent information, the American Detachment is lacking. The American infantry has 80 men, the cavalry has 70 men, the machine gun detachment has 60 men, and the Philippine detachment has 80 men. The number of vacancies is the highest of all the detachments. The Chinese Detachment has 160 infantrymen and 120 interpreters, all of whom are at full strength. As for the military supplies of the Volunteer Corps, they are extremely ample. The armored cars have been improved, the Lewis machine guns have been fitted with new barrels, and all military equipment is very satisfactory. However, due to funding issues, it is difficult to mass-produce uniforms for the time being.</p>
<h3>Silk Factories in the Concessions Shut Down: Spring Cocoons on the Market Under Control</h3>
<p>Silk reeling factories in the Shanghai concession area have been shut down, as the acquisition of cocoons and transportation to Shanghai have been controlled by the "Central China Company." Consequently, all twenty-odd factories, including foreign-owned ones, will not be acquiring cocoons this year. At the same time, due to the lack of raw materials, they have almost all ceased operations. The original plan to start operations after the spring cocoons entered the market is now impossible to implement. It has been learned that spring cocoons have entered the market in Hangzhou and other occupied areas. However, the "Central China Company" monopolizes everything, suppressing prices and forcing purchases. Silkworm farmers are forced to sell the cocoons to the "Central China Company" out of environmental pressure. It is said that the price of local cocoons ranges from $160 to $200 per 100 catties. If calculated based on the price of silk, it should be over $250. It is also heard that silkworm farmers along the Qiantang River are trying to transport cocoons to Zhejiang Province for sale, as the price of cocoons in eastern Zhejiang is higher than that offered by the "Central China Company."</p>
<h3>News of the Withdrawal of US Marines: Japanese Acknowledge Error</h3>
<p>#### Colonel Baker Formally Denies Report Yesterday</p>
<p>#### US Troops Stationed in Tianjin and Beiping Have Not Withdrawn Either</p>
<p>The China Press reports that a Japanese Navy spokesman replied to a foreign journalist yesterday (the 24th) that he was unaware of the report that the US Marines stationed in Shanghai would withdraw. However, he had received notification that there were some errors in the report.</p>
<p>The report was published on Friday in the Japanese-language "Shanghai Mainichi Shimbun" in a prominent position, stating that the US military's withdrawal from Shanghai was decided at a recent meeting in Manila, and that the US Marines stationed in Beiping and Tianjin had withdrawn two years ago. It has been found that the Japanese-language Shanghai Mainichi Shimbun published this absurd rumor, which has been formally denied by US Marine Corps Commander Colonel Baker. The truth has been revealed. Furthermore, the claim by the Japanese newspaper that the US Navy stationed in Tianjin and Beiping had withdrawn is also false. The US naval authorities in Shanghai also denied it yesterday. According to a diplomatic source, we can often recall the notes from the US government to the Japanese government and the declarations of US Secretary of State Hull, which have solemnly stated that they cannot recognize Japan's unilateral actions in the Far East and their attempt to maintain the status quo in the Far East. Therefore, the United States will never withdraw its troops stationed in Shanghai to change the status quo and allow the aggressors to run rampant.</p>
<h3>National Defense Bonds: Repayment of Principal and Interest</h3>
<p>#### Over 16 Million in Principal and Interest</p>
<p>#### Three-Year Deadline for Forfeiture</p>
<p>Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi announced that the lottery for the first repayment of the principal of the National Defense Bonds of 1938 was held in Shanghai on April 19, 1940. The winning numbers are No. 035, No. 160, No. 247, and No. 369, for a total of four numbers. All holders of these bonds whose last three digits of the bond number match the numbers listed above are the winning bonds. The total value is 2 million national currency, including 80 ten-thousand-yuan bonds, 120 five-thousand-yuan bonds, 520 one-thousand-yuan bonds, 720 one-hundred-yuan bonds, and 800 ten-yuan bonds. In addition, the second installment of interest on these bonds, totaling 14.94 million national currency, will be paid by the Central Bank and its authorized banks in various locations starting on April 30, 1940. The foreign portion will be drawn by the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications in Hong Kong. These winning bonds and matured interest coupons must be claimed within three years from the date of commencement of payment, after which they will be forfeited and no longer paid. The 58 interest coupons attached to the winning bonds, from the third installment to the sixtieth installment, should be returned to the managing bank when collecting the principal. If there are any missing coupons, the amount will be deducted from the principal to be paid. This announcement is hereby made.</p>
<h3>French Municipal Council Approves Widening of Avenue de la Gare</h3>
<p>In order to maintain traffic convenience due to the numerous wharves and congested freight traffic on the Bund of the French Concession, the French Concession Police Department planned to widen the roads. After submitting the proposal to the Board of Directors of the Municipal Council for review and approval, it was decided to widen the road between Rue du Nouveau Canal and Rue du Petit Pont to 24.38 meters (80 feet). This decision will be implemented whenever the houses on both sides of the road are renovated.</p>
<h3>Establishment of the 5th Security Column</h3>
<p>#### Appointment of Ding Yuntao as Commander</p>
<p>#### Gu Fusheng's Unit Supplements a Battalion of Artillery</p>
<p>#### Advance Units Have Already Entered Huangdu</p>
<p>Last September, Leng Xin, commander of the Second Guerrilla Zone of the Third War Area, appointed Mr. Ding Yuntao as the director for reorganizing scattered forces in Jiangnan. Mr. Ding, a scholar, accepted the difficult task and set up a headquarters in (illegible), with sufficient personnel, weapons, and ammunition. He has now been formally appointed as the commander of the 5th Jiangnan Security Column, and he was officially sworn in on April 1st. It has now been organized into three regiments, led by Ren Tianshi, Xu Wenlong, and Yang Zhen. All the subordinates are young and promising, sympathizing with merchants and civilians, and have gained the love of the local people. Recently, Jiangsu Province sent officials to support them officially. They are lurking in the Jiangnan area, waiting for orders to attack. In the near future, there will be good news.</p>
<h3>Strength of Gu's Unit</h3>
<p>A friend from Huangdu in Shanghai mentioned that Gu Fusheng's guerrilla unit has now been replenished and that the New Fourth Army has allocated a battalion of artillery, a company of machine guns, and a large infantry unit since withdrawing from the Qingpu-Shanghai Road. The spearhead unit arrived in Huangdu the day before yesterday. The Japanese and puppet troops fled at the news.</p>
<h3>Turmoil in Hangzhou</h3>
<p>The Japanese arsenal in Hangzhou was almost destroyed by Chinese guerrillas a few days ago. Because the construction of the bombs was not secret, it was discovered by the Japanese military police, who were able to avoid disaster. Afterwards, the Japanese army became extremely terrified and searched everywhere for the guerrillas, but found nothing. They forcibly accused Lu Huda and Guo Shiping of being suspects and arrested them. Their fate is unknown.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Merchants Reject the So-Called "Exchange Factories"</h3>
<p>#### Nominal Recovery but No Actual Restructuring</p>
<p>#### Shanghai Merchants Understand the Big Picture and Ignore It</p>
<p>Since the emergence of the Nanjing "organization," and for the sake of its early implementation of the "economic cooperation" item, a "Factory Acceptance Committee" has been organized to publicize the return of factories operated by Chinese merchants that were occupied by the Japanese. The factories of Shanghai merchants located in Yangshupu, Zhabei, Pudong, Wusong, and the western suburbs have been occupied since the withdrawal of the National Revolutionary Army. Most of the larger factories with complete equipment have been reopened by Japanese merchants. The puppet government wants to take over these factories, which are said to include those in the occupied areas of North and Central China, but in fact, they are focused on Shanghai. Therefore, they will soon set up a so-called "office" in Shanghai to handle the "registration" and "investigation" of various manufacturers. However, the manufacturers have already seen through this attempt and its true intentions and have decided not to be deceived.</p>
<p>The puppet government's so-called "acceptance" is actually the Japanese returning the occupied factories to the acceptance agency under certain conditions. Then, the owners of the factories are notified to "register" and must wait for "investigation." By the time the various procedures are completed, the cost may even exceed the value of the entire factory's assets. Even if "economic cooperation" and "mutual cooperation" are implemented, it is seemingly a nominal recovery but no actual restructuring. This would not only violate the recent strict orders from the Ministry of Economic Affairs warning manufacturers, but also ruin the factory's life. Unless they have ulterior motives, they would not want to take over the factories in the current environment. It is evident that all the occupied manufacturers in Shanghai understand the big picture. They do not care about their personal gains and losses and would rather take risks.</p>
<h3>Report of 3,000 Jewish Refugees Coming to Shanghai Denied by Police</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury reported that there were rumors that 3,000 Jewish refugees would come to Shanghai at the end of this month and that they all had landing permits issued by the Shanghai Municipal Council. The police have denied this. They claim that the Council has never issued so many permits and that there are no ships arriving next week, so how could 3,000 refugees come to Shanghai?</p>
<h3>Germany Not Interested in the Dutch East Indies Issue: Japan Disappointed, Distorts Explanation</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the English-language Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury published an article by Mr. Woodhead speculating whether Japan would take action in the Dutch East Indies. Mr. Woodhead said that the Japanese government felt extremely anxious about the German authorities' delay in responding after proposing to maintain the status quo in the Dutch East Indies. As a result, on the 22nd of this month, the German government replied that Germany was not interested in the Dutch East Indies issue. The Kokumin Shimbun, sponsored by the Japanese military, interpreted this reply as a "blank check," indicating that Germany was ignoring the interests of the future status of the Dutch East Indies. However, others interpreted the German side as urging Japan to abandon its neutral stance. According to Mr. Woodhead's opinion, it remains to be seen whether Japan will sincerely keep its promises to the United States and other relevant countries. Some Japanese newspapers believe that Japan is currently mired in the quagmire of the war in China and should not take any more risks. At the same time, they advocate ending the war in China as soon as possible to regain their freedom and do as they please. However, as things stand, Japan's attempt to end the war in China is difficult to achieve.</p>
<h3>Italian Passenger Ships Ordered to Suspend Service: Cargo Ships Continue to Operate Normally</h3>
<p>#### Two Cargo Ships Carry Cargoes as Usual Each Month</p>
<p>#### Whether the Conte Verde Will Carry Passengers Is Undecided</p>
<p>Italian passenger ships plying the Europe-Far East routes have been ordered to suspend service amidst the tightening of the European war and the attention being paid to Italy's position on the war. A reporter from the New Life News Agency inquired with the Italian shipping company about this matter. According to the company's staff, the Italian passenger ships have been ordered to suspend service, and the company has received notification. Although the reason for the suspension was not stated, it is undoubtedly affected by the European war. The suspension only applies to fast passenger ships, which mainly carry passengers and mail. After the suspension, passenger transport will be stopped. As for cargo transport, there are many cargo ships (commonly known as "tramp steamers") that regularly travel between Italy and the Far East. On average, at least two ships sail to China each month, each with a cargo capacity of 5,000 tons. These ships have no fixed routes and travel to various ports depending on cargo needs. Small docks along the route are also called at. These Italian ships are still operating normally, so cargo transport between Europe and the Far East will continue as usual. The fast passenger ships Conte Verde and Conte Rosso are the only two ships affected. The Conte Rosso has ceased sailing to the Far East. The Conte Verde is expected to arrive in Shanghai on the 7th of next month. As the ship still needs to return to Italy, it will carry passengers as usual. However, the company cannot confirm whether it will be ordered to stop carrying passengers. If this happens, the tickets that have already been sold will be refunded accordingly. As for whether mail to Europe can be transported by cargo ships, this is still under negotiation.</p>
<h3>Abe's Economic Advisor Aoki Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Aoki Kazuo, the former Minister of Finance and economic advisor to the Japanese "Envoy" Abe Nobuyuki, returned to Japan earlier to make contact. It is reported that he arrived in Shanghai from Japan last night on the Taiyo Maru and is scheduled to go to Nanjing today to report to Abe. The purpose of Aoki's trip is unknown, but he attended a meeting held by the Japanese "Asia Development Board" on the 8th to discuss the legal tender issue, indicating that he is an envoy of economic aggression.</p>
<h3>American Overseas Trade Week: Grand Conclusion Yesterday; American Chamber of Commerce Hosts Banquet for Admiral Hepburn and Others; Kept Simple Due to Current Situation; Admiral Hepburn's Speech</h3>
<p>American Overseas Trade Week concluded yesterday. Admiral Hepburn, Commander-in-Chief of the US Asiatic Fleet, Rear Admiral Glassford, Commander of the Yangtze River Patrol, Captain Baker, Commander of the Fourth Naval District in Shanghai, Colonel Moulay, Chief of Staff, Mr. Badeck, Acting Consul General in Shanghai, Mr. Grant, Commercial Attaché in China, Mr. Hymel, Judge of the US Court for China, and Mr. Smith of the American Chamber of Commerce, along with over two hundred others, were hosted at a banquet on the 24th by the American Chamber of Commerce at the American Club to mark the end of the "Sixth Foreign Trade Commemoration."  In previous years, the American Overseas Trade Commemoration Week had grand ceremonies, even with people taking the opportunity to fly around Shanghai's airspace and distribute colored leaflets.  In recent years, due to the current situation, extravagance has been avoided.  The beginning of American trade with China dates back to 1785.</p>
<p>Sino-American Relations</p>
<p>A brief history of US-China trade is as follows: In 1785, the "Empress of China" became the first American ship to complete a trading mission to Guangzhou and return to New York. In 1786, the US government appointed the first American Consul to China (stationed as Consul General in Guangzhou). In 1830, American missionaries began arriving in China. In 1840, the Pan-American Era ship sailed to China. In 1843, the first American Ambassador arrived in China. In 1844, the United States began to establish</p>
<p>Trade Treaties</p>
<p>In 1852, US$180,000,000 in American gold, accumulated from 1784 to 1852, was shipped to China. In 1855, the Pan-American ship "Icali Puli" continued to sail in Chinese waters under the escort of an ironclad warship. In 1871, the Chinese Ministry of Education sent the first group of 120 students to study in the United States in four batches. In 1877, the American Russell &amp; Company sold ships to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. In 1898, the American flag began to fly over the Philippines. In 1899, American political commentators advocated for the</p>
<p>Open Door Policy</p>
<p>In 1905, the United States completed the Pacific undersea telegraph cable. In 1910, the Pacific States Chamber of Commerce also sent a commercial delegation to China. In that year, China not only traded with the United States alone, but also expanded to countries along the Pacific coast. In 1911, the United States took the lead in recognizing China as a republic. In 1914, the Panama Canal opened, shortening the distance from the Atlantic to China. In 1922, the Nine-Power Treaty Conference was convened by the United States in Washington. In 1924, the American Dollar Steamship Company (now renamed American President Lines) completed its worldwide routes and established a branch office in China. In 1915, the</p>
<p>Boxer Indemnity</p>
<p>of US$12,500,000 was returned to China. (Note: After the Boxer Rebellion in 1900, China paid the foreign powers a total of 450 million taels of silver in compensation.) In 1928, the United States was the first to recognize China's national tariff autonomy. In 1930, Sino-American telegraph communication was established. In 1934, US-China trade ranked first. In 1935, the United States approved the independence of the Philippines. On May 22, 1936, Sino-American shortwave radio completed two-way communication. On October 23 of the same year,</p>
<p>Sino-American Air Traffic</p>
<p>Pan American Clippers began transporting mail and passengers in Hong Kong, via Manila, Guam, and Honolulu to San Francisco. On April 27, 1937, Sino-American air service officially began. On May 19 of that year, Sino-American wireless telephone service officially commenced. In 1939, the Golden Gate International Exposition was held, and China was invited to participate. The newest shortwave machine W6XBF at US Naval Station Pearl Harbor was completed on February 18.</p>
<p>Hepburn's Speech</p>
<p>When the American Chamber of Commerce held a dinner for foreign trade, Admiral Hepburn, Commander-in-Chief of the US Asiatic Fleet, delivered a speech entitled "Free Trade," pointing out the disadvantages of trade barriers, denouncing the disasters of military rule, extolling the benefits of equal trade, and expressing the US Navy's attitude of upholding justice. The words were sincere and earnest, translated as follows:</p>
<p>International Trade</p>
<p>is the supreme method for maintaining peace and mutual benefit between nations. I would like to quote a section from a book by former US Undersecretary of State Sayre (now the High Commissioner to the Philippines) to illustrate this. Sayre said, "The interdependence and mutual benefit between peoples is based on the vast and intricate network of international trade. If trade is freed from the barriers of heavy restrictions and allowed to remain free forever, the lives of all peoples will inevitably collapse, and the standard of living will be forced to decline. The magnitude of the harm will be inestimable. To this day, no major industrial nation can be economically independent. Therefore, economic self-sufficiency is merely a policy of regression and hindrance to cultural progress." The United States and other countries have established</p>
<p>International Relations</p>
<p>following this principle for many years. In accordance with the Trade Agreements Act, we will do our best to improve international trade, carefully consider the environment, and separately conclude agreements. Those who benefit are not only the United States itself. The United States acts for its own benefit, but shares the benefits with others. We and other countries obtain equal opportunities and mutually beneficial and fair treatment. Unfortunately, the world today is running counter to this. The matter is obvious and needs no detailed explanation. However, I cannot help but say that we deeply know that there is a kind of organized distortion theory that is trying to dominate the thoughts and beliefs of some people. This situation is</p>
<p>Extremely Dangerous</p>
<p>and makes the future bleak and uncertain. The tendency of military rule is extremely strong and expanding on the earth, and the opportunity for free trade is being squeezed and becoming narrower. The United States is a powerful country, and its military power, like other factors, is also at its peak, and its naval power is growing stronger and stronger. As a member of the Navy, I firmly believe that we will never use force lightly. If our country must use its force, then our war will never be for the purpose of treating other nations unfairly in war.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops in Xiaoshan</h3>
<p>Shipping circles have learned that Japanese troops in Xiaoshan City suddenly divided into eastern and southern routes starting on the 20th of this month. The objective of the eastern team seems to be harassing Ningbo and Shaoxing, while the southern troops plan to invade Zhuji. They were intercepted by Chinese troops at different locations. As of the 23rd, the Japanese troops had retreated to Xiaoshan and were trapped in the city, not venturing beyond its walls. The fighting on the south bank of the Qiantang River has once again become quiet. Furthermore, near Xiaoshan Port, a large grey Japanese warship was suddenly spotted on the morning of the 23rd, firing six shots towards the shore, causing shock among the residents.</p>
<h3>Sunday School Promotion Association Holds 20th Anniversary Celebration</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese Christian Sunday School Promotion Association has been established for twenty years, during which it has set up twenty-seven Sunday schools. After the August 13th Incident, it also added twelve temporary Sunday schools in various refugee camps. Later, as they were gradually disbanded, only two remain. The work spans the entire Shanghai area. This year marks the 20th anniversary of the association's founding. Today, starting at 4:00 PM, the association will hold its annual meeting at the Yu Qiaqing Road Moore Memorial Church. Starting at 7:00 PM, there will also be Thanksgiving services and other programs, as well as achievement exhibitions, speeches, and music.</p>

<h3>French Veterans in Shanghai Enthusiastically Pledge Loyalty to their Homeland; General Assembly Held the Night Before Last; French Ambassador and Consul General Attend</h3>
<p>The French-language Shanghai Daily News reported that the French expatriate veterans' association in Shanghai held a special general assembly the night before last (the 24th) at the French Concession Police Headquarters to discuss association affairs. French Ambassador Cosme, Consul General Orin, and Garrison Commander Colonel Aisoudy, among others, were warmly received by the members.</p>
<p>President's Speech: Willing to Obey Orders</p>
<p>First, Mr. Aicar, President of the French Veterans' Association, delivered a welcome speech to French Ambassador Cosme, stating, "It is a great honor for this association to have the Ambassador present to guide our meeting. The Ambassador participated in the last World War for four years and received the Croix de Guerre for his military achievements. I do not wish that the last World War would not become the final war. Now, the members of this association are willing to obey the Ambassador's orders wholeheartedly. We have only one thought in our minds, and that is to defend our country. Although the members are gradually aging, injured, or hindered by their duties and cannot shed blood for the country again, they all follow the Ambassador's command and enthusiastically donate. Because of the high cost of airplanes, tanks, and cannons, we have already purchased 50,000 francs worth of military bonds to contribute our modest efforts. Each member will certainly make every effort to purchase them as well. The members of this association have an unwavering belief in the future of France."</p>
<p>Ambassador's Reply: Expresses Gratitude</p>
<p>French Ambassador Cosme then delivered a reply, briefly stating, "Today, I am deeply moved to meet with old friends who fought together on the battlefield twenty years ago. Thinking of the current situation of French youth fighting for civilization and against barbarism (applause), our minds are bound to be even more tense. France's current situation is indeed very serious, but it should be known that there have been environments in the past that were worse than today. Twenty years ago, the Germans were closer to Paris than they are today, but we eventually drove them back and won victory. I have no doubt about the outcome of the war. In the last World War, thanks to the loyalty and bravery of the French, we were able to defeat the enemy. This time, I believe that the government leaders will be able to save our France. I am very grateful for the willingness of each member to listen to my and the Consul General's, Colonel Aisoudy's, and others' orders. I can assure you that I will never abandon you and will do my best to protect your rights. I now shout 'Long live France' to show my respect for the country." After the speech, everyone stood up and shouted "Vive la France" three times, their emotions soaring and deeply moving.</p>
<p>Belgian Veterans Join</p>
<p>Later, President Aicar reported on the case of people requesting to join the French expatriate veterans' association as members, which was approved. The association's articles of association were also revised to allow Belgian members to enjoy the same rights as French members.

<h3>Young Female Factory Worker Dies Tragically from Illegal Abortion; Neck Shows Signs of Strangulation; Case Highly Suspicious; All Involved Parties Arrested and Awaiting Death</h3>
<p>The Yulin Road Police Station received a report from the Quan'an Inn at No. 5, Lane 208, Yangshupu Road, at 9:30 AM the day before yesterday, stating that a young woman was found dead in room 36 of the inn. The police station immediately ordered Chinese Detective Zhang Yunhong and Western Detective Ross to investigate. They found the woman lying supine on the bed, the bedding and pillows stained with blood, her face swollen and purple, her body covered in blisters, and her neck showing</p>
<p>Signs of Strangulation</p>
<p>They called for an ambulance, and the body was sent to Hudong Hospital, where she was confirmed dead. It was then transferred to the Coroner's Office, and the Public Works Department's prison doctor, Hall, examined the body and found blood flowing from the deceased's mouth and nose, distinct marks of rope on her neck, a torn lower body, and the head of a child visible inside her vagina. It was determined that she had died from a poorly performed abortion. The fetus was estimated to be six to seven months old, its body covered in blisters, possibly caused by taking hot medicine. It was determined that she had died within the past twelve hours. The Chinese and Western detectives then</p>
<p>Began an Investigation</p>
<p>They learned that the deceased was named Peng Genhuo, 18 years old, from Shanghai. She worked as a factory worker at the China Soap Factory at No. 2310, Yangshupu Road, and lived with her mother, Peng Yang, at a small residence at No. 112, Glen Road. She was still unmarried. Last year, Peng suddenly fell in love with someone, and they had an illicit affair, resulting in pregnancy. By now, she was six months pregnant, and her abdomen was gradually swelling. Her mother, Peng Yang, only noticed something unusual about her daughter's abdomen on the 20th of this month. Under strict questioning, the</p>
<p>Secret was Revealed</p>
<p>Considering the matter of face, Peng Yang and her common-law husband's brother-in-law, Lu Delin (also known as Zhang Yilian), from Jiangbei, discussed a plan to get rid of the child. They entrusted an old midwife, Liu Huang (62 years old, from Jiangbei, living at No. 17, Lane 795, Pingliang Road), to perform the abortion, agreeing on a fee of 40 yuan, with 20 yuan paid in advance. On the 22nd of this month, Lu, under the name of Zhang Yilian, booked a room at the Quan'an Inn, room 36. Liu Huang performed the surgery, but unfortunately, due to her lack of skill, the fetus was stillborn, and Peng Genhuo died on the night of the 23rd. The detectives quickly apprehended Peng Yang, Lu Delin, and Liu Huang.</p>
<p>Arrested One After Another</p>
<p>Liu Huang had heard the news and fled to Wujiaochang, Xujiahui. Detectives from the French Concession Police Station were also involved and arrested her, bringing her back to the police station. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin filed charges of abortion resulting in death under Articles 289 and 290 of the Criminal Code and requested a postponement to allow for an autopsy to clarify the truth. Judge Xiao Peishen briefly questioned the three defendants and ordered them to be detained pending a further hearing in seven days.</p>
<h3>German Cotton Cloth Store Owner Sells Opium; Convicted of Smoking</h3>
<p>Ye Yuxi, Chief Chinese Detective of the Central Police Station's Narcotics Department, along with Detective Liu Zhaonian and Detective Zhao Baosheng, cracked down on a major opium trafficking operation on the 20th of this month at the Dechangni Cloth Store at No. 19, Lane 300, Chongqing Road. They discovered 132 taels of opium in a double-bottomed chest and wardrobe and quickly detained the owner of the Dechang Store, Zhu Zhizhang from Hangzhou, along with his wife, Zhu Wu, and their seals. They were taken to the First Special District Court for questioning and detention, as reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Xiao Peishen continued the hearing of this case in the Second Criminal Court. The defendants were represented by lawyer Wu Linkun. After a clear confession, Zhu Wu was sentenced to six months in prison and fined 300 yuan for smoking opium. If the imprisonment is commuted to a fine, it will be calculated at 3 yuan per day. Zhu Zhizhang was sentenced to five months in prison, and if the imprisonment is commuted to a fine, it will also be calculated at 3 yuan per day. The opium and other items were confiscated according to the list.</p>
<h3>Gambling on Pai Gow Leads to Murder</h3>
<p>Feng Zhengde (40 years old) from Yangzhou, a barber living at No. 28, Tianfu Lane, Air Force Road, loved to gamble on Pai Gow. At 10:00 PM on the 24th, Feng went to the home of his fellow villager, Zhao Qifa, at No. 9, Lane 435, Bazili Road, to gamble on Pai Gow. Zhao was the banker. As a result, Feng Zhengde lost 5 jiao 6 fen. Due to a shortage of 6 fen, a quarrel broke out, with mutual insults. This was followed by a fight, and Zhao's brother-in-law, Wang Chengfa and Wang Chengru, seeing that Feng was strong and Zhao was no match for him, stepped forward to help, knocking Feng Zhengde to the ground and punching and kicking him. Feng's lower back was the most severely injured, and he was on the verge of death. Zhao Qifa, in a panic, took the opportunity to escape. Tang Guangfu, the Chinese detective in charge of the Hongkou Police Station, arrived after receiving the report and learned the cause of the trouble. He sent the injured man by car to the Bazili Road Sanatorium, but he died shortly after despite medical treatment. The body was sent to the Jiaozhou Road Coroner's Office for examination. The two Wang brothers, accomplices, were arrested and taken to the police station. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Qian Xunjiu explained the case and requested a postponement. Judge Jiang Shuzi questioned the two defendants, and their confessions were evasive. He ordered them to be detained pending examination of Feng's body and a further hearing.</p>
<h3>Dye Factory Employee Steals Pigments</h3>
<p>The Yuda Dye Factory at No. 4, Lane 217, Fulili Road in the French Concession, had 54 jin of pigments worth 3,231 yuan stolen on January 12 of this year. The incident was reported to the French Concession Police Station, requesting an investigation. Detectives Guo Shaorong and Li Shuren learned that the case involved two employees of the factory, Dong Bailin and Wang Renlian, who colluded to steal the goods and sell them to Wang Ashui, a Shaoxing native at No. 162, Yu Shenfu Road, for 700 yuan, which they split. After Wang bought the stolen goods, he resold them to Wang Hongjin, a Shaoxing native at No. 14, Gujia Lane, Beijing Road, for 1,200 yuan. On the 21st of this month, Wang Renlian and the two receivers of the stolen goods, Wang Ashui and Wang Hongjin, were arrested. The main culprit, Dong Bailin, had fled after hearing the news. Wang and others were taken back to the police station for detention. Yesterday, the police station escorted Wang and the other two to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court. Police lawyer Chen Ming presented the case and requested that the defendants be detained temporarily for further investigation and to apprehend the fugitive main culprit, with a further hearing at a later date. Wang Renlian confessed to colluding to steal and sell the goods and splitting the proceeds. Wang Ashui and Wang Hongyu admitted to receiving stolen goods. Judge Liao He approved the postponement of the hearing and ordered all defendants to be detained.</p>

<h3>Two Police Detectives Suddenly Arrested by Bogus Police; Released After Interrogation</h3>
<p>The North-China Daily News reported that yesterday (the 24th) afternoon, several "city police" officers on motorcycles near the former George's Ballroom on Yuyuan Road and Siccawei Road overstepped their authority and arrested two Chinese detectives from the Public Security Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council. These officers did not explain their reasons, nor did they question them. Instead, they disarmed the detectives and forced them into the sidecar of a motorcycle and drove west. Minutes later, the Jing'an Temple Police Station received a report from an eyewitness and immediately began an investigation. According to a reporter's inquiry last night, the two Chinese detectives were forcibly taken to the "Sub-Police Station" at No. 39, Yidingpan Road. After questioning, they were transferred to the Western District Police Headquarters at No. 76, Jessfield Road, and questioned again for a long time. It was only then that it was determined that the two were detectives and carried credentials. They were released at 2:00 PM, and their pistols were returned. According to an eyewitness who told the reporter that the Chinese detectives had never left the Concession's roads, they did not resist when they were forcibly taken by the "city police," knowing that they had not committed any illegal acts. It is said that the two detectives were off duty when they were "arrested." On the 9th of this month, Ge Lobokov, Deputy Inspector of the Public Security Department, and a Chinese detective were also "arrested" for embezzling public funds on Jessfield Road and detained for several hours before being released.</p>
<h3>Wang Yijing, a Guest at the Oriental Hotel, Kidnapped Yesterday; Wang Led a Concubine to Shanghai; Suddenly, Violent Guests Snatched Him from His Residence</h3>
<p>A kidnapping occurred on the third floor of the Oriental Hotel at No. 120, Yuqiaqing Road, at around 8:00 AM yesterday morning. The kidnapped person was Wang Yijing from Haimen, and there were three kidnappers, two wearing Western suits and one wearing a long gown. They forced him into a waiting car and sped towards Race Course Road. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Living in Seclusion with a Concubine</p>
<p>Wang Yijing is from Ting Su Haimen, 54 years old, of medium height, and has a short beard. He has been running the Fengtaihe grain store in his hometown of Haimen for many years. Half a month ago, he brought his family to Shanghai and stayed at the New Oriental Hotel, opening room 309. On the day before yesterday (the 21st), several fellow villagers arrived in Shanghai, so there was not enough room. They opened room 311 across the hall to</p>
<p>Live in Seclusion with a Concubine. Unexpectedly, at around 8:00 AM yesterday morning, three uninvited guests suddenly arrived, two wearing Western suits and one wearing a Palitot long gown. They arrived at the front of room 309 and loudly asked the waiter to open the door. When a waiter arrived, the three people asked him if this room was opened by Mr. Wang. The voice was very fierce. At this time, Wang Jidong in room 311 was also awakened and opened the door to see what was happening. He said to the three people, "Sirs, why are you asking about room 309? I opened this room too." At this time, the two men wearing Western suits used force to push Wang into room 211, locked the door tightly, and started cursing loudly. At that time, there was a waiter named Wang Hailin, No. 53,</p>
<p>Sudden Criminals</p>
<p>He suddenly saw this and knew that they were not good people. He immediately stepped forward and said, "Sirs, if you want to arrest someone, please contact the front desk first." The man wearing the long gown suddenly said, "We are here on the orders of the Military Police Headquarters." He reached out to take out a document, and then immediately ordered Wang Hailin to leave. Wang was forced to leave reluctantly. When he returned to the hall, he quickly used the telephone to report to the Shanghai Municipal Police. As he was talking to the switchboard operator, the criminal wearing the long gown noticed and struck the back of his neck with a Mauser pistol butt. Wang, fearing his power, immediately put down the phone and sat silently in the hall.</p>
<p>Forced into a Car</p>
<p>After a while, two bandits pushed Wang Jijing down the stairs. At that time, Wang was wearing a vest, white Indian silk trousers, and straw slippers on his bare feet. He had a white serge long gown hanging in his hand. At this time, the gatekeeper of the hotel was carrying a teapot out to make tea. He saw two bandits dragging Wang out of the gate and quickly put down the teapot and followed them. He saw Wang being pushed into a car and speeding west towards Race Course Road. The license plate number of the car was 8906. Afterwards, the hotel's front desk reported the incident to the Lao Zha Police Station, and Chinese and Western detectives were dispatched to investigate and track down the bandits.</p>
<p>Wang's Family Background</p>
<p>The reporter rushed to room 309 after hearing the news and met his beloved concubine, Zhang (28 years old). According to her, Wang opened a grain store in his hometown, which was a joint venture. The family was ordinary. On the 10th of this month, he brought her and his eldest daughter, Zheng (30 years old), second daughter, Taisheng (16 years old), one son named Runsheng (5 years old), another family female teacher, Zhang Fen (21 years old), and male servant Zhiyi, to Shanghai. They have been staying here for half a month. The daily room rate is 8 yuan. Wang came to purchase goods and to treat his second daughter Taisheng's lung disease. He originally planned to find a house to stay in Shanghai temporarily, but it was not easy to rent one, so it has been delayed until now. Three days ago, several people came from the countryside and then rented the opposite door, room 311, for the rest of us to live in. This unfortunate event happened. There were no threatening letters beforehand. Wang was once in the military, but he had already abandoned his job to become a businessman. Now he was kidnapped by bandits, which is really puzzling. It is said that Wang has one wife and two concubines at home. His next wife is Chen Wenyuan, 36 years old, and the second concubine is Chen Lianying, 35 years old, both from Haimen. Zhang is his third concubine, from Changshu.</p>
<h3>Social News</h3>
<p>At the intersection of Xin Zha Road and Parker Road, at about 9:46 AM yesterday, a young woman, Chen Zhang, 19 years old, and her husband, Chen Afa (31 years old), were getting on a public bus. She accidentally lost her footing and fell, causing her head to be run over by the wheel, her brains splattering. She died on the spot. Her husband then reported to the nearby police, recorded the license plate number of the driver who caused the accident, and quickly called an ambulance to transport the body to the Coroner's Office. The Shanghai Court sent someone to investigate.</p>
<p>Qin Liansheng, 20 years old, a guest in room 214 of the Daxin Hotel at No. 108, Hubei Road, had thoughts of suicide for unknown reasons. At about 12:20 PM yesterday, he secretly took poison and attempted suicide. He was discovered and sent to Renji Hospital for treatment.</p>
<p>Zhang Gongxian, 11 years old, a boy living at No. 103, Lane 1462, Rue Amiral Foucault, was suffering from economic hardship and had suicidal thoughts. At around 2:09 PM yesterday afternoon, he secretly took poison and attempted suicide. He was later sent to Baojiang Hospital for treatment.</p>

<h3>Tea Market</h3>
<p>The new tea from the mountains this year has already been launched in Hankou and other places for some days. The most worrying is the first-grade, newly harvested tea. The tea from India this year is better in color and richer in flavor, even surpassing the best Chinese tea. Letters received from England indicate that the quantity of Indian tea is several times that of Chinese tea. The finest Chinese tea is even losing money, estimated at a loss of four shillings to five or six pence per pound. Lower grades, though not losing as much, still suffer considerable wastage. Sales in England are still brisk, but because there is too much of both Chinese and Indian tea, everyone is trying to sell, and the number of sellers exceeds the number of buyers. Therefore, tea prices must be set by the buyers, and Westerners are incurring losses in large numbers. In addition, the six-month bills of exchange this year have been changed to three months, and banks know that many tea merchants are losing money, so they are requiring less silver for remittance. For example, tea worth 10,000 silver taels last year could be remitted for 9,000 taels, but now it is perhaps 7,500 or 8,000 taels. Therefore, more silver must be added, and I fear no one will rush to buy tea. I hope the Chinese in the interior will be aware of this. However, the exchange rate this year may be expected to fall further, which is a good thing, because gold is becoming more expensive and silver cheaper. Currently, six-month bills of exchange are at four shillings and eleven and a half pence per tael, while bank sight drafts are at four shillings and nine pence and eight eight five per tael.</p>

<h3>Whom Do I Fear? (Continued)</h3>
<p>Methods for helping people overcome fear vary. Offering good, clear, and sincere advice, making them understand that the future is valuable, can help them overcome fear. Furthermore, personal self-control and self-training can also be very beneficial. A person who can command their own spirit is greater than one who captures a great city. Because our worst enemy is ourselves, and fearing ourselves is the primary among many fears. Self-control is like a door to escape fear. If a person can grasp themselves, control their impulses, and inspire their willpower daily, they are walking on the path to overcoming fear. But even if we reach this point, we still haven't achieved the final solution to this problem of fear. The most reliable way for life to overcome fear is through religion. Unfortunately, people put fear together with religion, threatening people to do good, but true religion cannot be based on fear. Life is a great adventure, and no one knows what life can give us. There are always clouds of doubt on the path of life, but there is no need to fear. Fear only weakens our spirit and drags us down. We must use justice, courage, love, truth, and virtue to overcome fear. A person who strives to live a clean life and uses such faith as a background, believing that God will create glorious miracles from ordinary people, is a victor. They never fear death. To them, death is just a door to a more refined, greater, and more fulfilling life—a continuation of the great adventure. We are in God, with the trumpets blowing ahead, urging us to advance, not retreat. Truth and love are the panacea for conquering fear and the priceless legacy of religion. "The Lord is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear? The Lord is the strength of my life; of whom shall I be afraid?" (End)</p>

<h3>How to Aspire to Do Great Things</h3>
<p>— Yan Maode</p>
<p>We should pay attention and not think that doing great things means becoming a high official. That is absolutely wrong. Being an official is to serve the people, which is just one career. However, so-called great things mean: "Whatever you do, you must do it thoroughly from beginning to end, and success is a great thing." Here, let me give an example: Former U.S. President Lincoln, in his childhood, had a very poor family, and he couldn't even get enough to eat. Of course, he had no opportunity to study, but he had a great spirit of creation, and he had the ambition to do his best for society and the country. At the age of sixteen, he strongly opposed the slavery system, and later, through hard work and practice, he finally achieved his goal and became the President of the United States. Lincoln's spirit of perseverance became a great thing, so Lincoln is immortal in history.</p>
<p>Based on the lessons of great success, to do great things, one must possess the following two conditions:</p>
<p>1. Establish Ambition: So-called ambition is the goal of doing things in life. Once you have a goal, you should always adhere to it and strive to achieve it. Never lose your ambition because of poverty, or become arrogant because of wealth.</p>
<p>2. Should have an indomitable spirit, a spirit of continuous efforts, courage, and consistent perseverance, in order to achieve career success.</p>
<p>Dear children! You are the buds of the nation, the seedlings of the country, and the source of mankind. Therefore, I hope that in your childhood, you should establish ambition, learn from Lincoln's hardworking spirit, and you will naturally be able to do great things and become great people in the future.</p>
<h3>Commemorating Martyr Xu Xilin</h3>
<p>— Lu Lishi</p>
<p>Children, today is May 26th. Everyone does not think that today is a memorial day. Everyone will ignore this great revolutionary feat, but we cannot forget that there was a martyr Xu Xilin in the history of the revolution. He was a revolutionary practitioner. The great thing he did today is enough to illuminate the ages and exemplify the world. Now, I will introduce this matter to the children!</p>
<p>Mr. Xu's name is Xilin, and his alias is Bosun. He is from Shaoxing, Zhejiang. He was rich in revolutionary ideas since he was a child. He believes that revolution should not be empty talk, but should be done in practice. When he was the chief of Anhui Army Primary School and concurrently the director of the Patrol Police School, he contacted many revolutionary comrades to plot an uprising in Anhui.</p>
<p>At that time, the governor of Anhui was named Enming. One day, he suddenly summoned him (Martyr Xu) to talk, saying: "The other day, the Governor-General of Liangjiang captured a revolutionary party member surnamed Ye, who confessed that there are many party members in Anhui plotting an uprising, and a certain Xu is also among them. You go and investigate." As soon as Martyr Xu heard the name Xu, he knew that the matter had been leaked, and it was better to strike first. At that time, he superficially agreed to go and investigate, but secretly planned to launch it earlier.</p>
<p>On May 26th of the fifth year of the Republic of China, the Patrol Police School was about to graduate, and Governor Enming was going to come in person to preside over the examination and review the exercises. Martyr Xu Xilin thought that a great opportunity had come. When the ceremony was being held in the auditorium, Martyr Xu Xilin suddenly ran to Enming and said: "Today the Revolutionary Army is launching an uprising!" Enming was shocked and asked: "How did you know?" Before he finished speaking, Martyr Xu Xilin had thrown a bomb on the ground. The bomb did not explode, so he quickly pulled out two pistols from his waist and fired at Enming. Enming fell to the ground and died. At this time, all the officials were frightened and fled in all directions.</p>
<p>That night, Martyr Xu was arrested! The official said to Martyr Xu: "Why did you assassinate Enming? Do you know that you have committed a crime? Tomorrow, we will cut open your heart and liver to see if you are still fierce." Martyr Xu laughed and said: "My assassination of Enming is to achieve the purpose of the revolution. Now that the purpose has been achieved, I am willing to have my body cut into thousands of pieces. Why care about a mere heart and liver!"</p>
<p>The next day, Martyr Xu was indeed cruelly dismembered and his heart was taken out.</p>
<h3>Epidemic Disease</h3>
<p>— Yu Zhen</p>
<p>Spring is fleeting and will soon pass. These few days are already the late spring and early summer. On the wooden poles on the streets and on the shop windows, there are eye-catching leaflets, which are warnings from the Bureau of Works and Hygiene to citizens to quickly prevent cholera, typhoid, malaria and other epidemic diseases. Indeed, in these few days, due to the cold and warm climate, flies have begun to be active, breeding their race, but affecting the health of the human body, because flies are masters of spreading diseases. This kind of leaflet can also be found on the road that Ahui takes to school.</p>
<p>Ah Hui saw a leaflet on the road about "Prevention of Cholera," but he was confused. "Cholera is an epidemic disease, commonly known as cholera with vomiting and diarrhea. This is a very dangerous disease. If you suffer from this disease, hurry up and ask a doctor to diagnose it, otherwise there is a danger of death."</p>
<p>"Then how is it transmitted? Why do people get this disease? Are there any preventive measures?" Ah Hui anxiously asked these two questions.</p>
<p>"When pathogenic bacteria parasitize in our bodies, they can secrete a kind of toxin that destroys the tissues in the body, causing the normal functions of the body to be hindered, and then diseases occur. Cholera is a kind of cholera bacteria, and their traces can be found in tap water, milk, etc. They enter our bodies through the medium of flies and mosquitoes. Of course, there are preventive methods, and there are many of them, which are countless. Simple methods: (1) Passively, do not drink unboiled raw water and unfiltered cold water, do not eat food that has been nailed by flies or overnight, and all kinds of unclean things. (2) Actively: get vaccinations, kill flies and mosquitoes, all food must be properly stored, keep the house dry and sunbathe, these are easy and achievable methods" (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Shirley Temple's Autobiography (4)</h3>
<p>— Min</p>
<p>I often like to dance. Mother has said that, and I think she must be right, because she knows everything about me and understands me better than anyone else. I've heard her say that when I was just learning to walk, I liked to dance. According to my mother, when I first walked, I was different from other children. My steps were fluttery, like a little angel. Whenever she turned on the radio in our house, as soon as I heard the music, I would dance the most beautiful steps.</p>
<p>Connie, I'll tell you a secret. There were many times when my mother didn't turn on the radio, and I turned it on myself. I twirled around in the living room, creating new steps. Later, in the film studio, Mr. Jack Sheasby taught me dance steps, which helped me a lot in the various films I starred in. Do you remember William Robinson, who danced the staircase dance with me in "The Little Colonel"? He said that when I get older, I will be able to create my own new steps, just like other good dancers.</p>
<p>One night, Dad was giving me a bath. I was only three years old at that time, and now I'm six years old, and Dad still gives me a bath. Mom started telling me that it would be a good idea to send me to dance school. Several of the children in the neighborhood were going to dance school to learn to dance. I remember Mom saying to Dad, "George, it's only one hour a week, and the tuition is only five cents."</p>
<p>Dad didn't look very happy. He said I was too young to go to dance school, and they didn't want me to be a dancer. He said that there had never been anyone in his family or Mom's family who had been on the stage or screen. In his view, learning to dance would not benefit our family in any way.</p>
<p>Mom smiled and argued with Dad for a while, and finally won the last victory. The next morning, she took me to dance school. The school wasn't far from our house. I put on my best clothes and looked very beautiful. But when we got there, the teacher protested and said that I shouldn't come like this next time, but should just wear plain clothes. It turned out that the clothes worn by the other girls in the school were very plain, and the boys just wore ordinary shirts. Moms and other moms sat on long benches against the wall, watching us learn to dance. The teacher told us to line up and do a kind of slight jumping step, and we followed her to dance, first with one foot and then with the other, and someone else played a "Down the Su River" tune on the piano.</p>
<p>Connie, how messy my steps were at that time! Fortunately, you weren't there, or you would have been ashamed of me. However, I can often dance my feet according to my own ideas. I can do whatever I want. You see me dancing those very simple steps on the screen, but I have worked hard for hours. Even the dance steps in "Stand Up and Cheer!" and "Baby Take a Bow" seem to be the simplest, but they were very difficult when I first learned them. But I always put my heart into learning, and after learning them, I won't forget them even if I don't need these steps. Every time I meet Jimmy Dunn on the set, I have to dance with him first. We first cooperate with the little dance in the film "Baby Take a Bow", and then shake hands with him. But I was only four and a half years old when I first learned this little dance, and it has been two years since then, but I still haven't forgotten it.</p>

<h3>German Amusement in the 1940 New York World's Fair</h3>
<p>— Xin Ying</p>
<p>— More Spectacular Than Last Year</p>
<p>In this year's New York World's Fair, just like last year, all kinds of amusements are being gathered, and everything is available. Moreover, there are many venues and programs that are different from last year; therefore, it is still necessary to introduce them to the readers.</p>
<p>In the 1940 New York World's Fair venue, there are stage plays, movies, dances, singing, miscellaneous performances, wireless movies, wireless radio broadcasts, and everything else. Moreover, most of the amusement troupes are famous on Broadway, and their performances have already been quite successful.</p>
<p>Among the various amusements, what is particularly worth mentioning is a grand music hall that has been completely newly built. Construction started on February 15th and officially opened on May 11th. Various construction projects were completed in three months.</p>
<p>This large music hall runs from east to west, from the Sunlight Valley area in the east to the houseboat room along the fountain in the west. The interior is very spacious and can accommodate 7,000 spectators. The admission ticket is quite cheap, only 40 cents per person.</p>
<p>The sole purpose of this grand music hall is to introduce American historical musical dramas, operas, and comedies. In recent years, American audiences have had a strong interest in singing and dancing. The performance of classical musical dramas has given many audiences a deep understanding of the development of American stage history.</p>
<p>Since the grand music hall opened on the 11th, all singing programs have been performed by musical drama, stage, and radio stars. In addition, one hundred singers participated, as well as a singing class, including one hundred singing and dancing stars and male and female soloists. Moreover, two hundred and sixty-nine talented children formed a children's paradise to join the performance. With so many talents, the program is naturally more exciting than last year!</p>
<h3>The Drama Craze in the Temporary Capital (Middle)</h3>
<p>— Ying</p>
<p>"Nation Above All"</p>
<p>Mr. Lao She, a new playwright who became famous for "Remnants of Mist," returned from comforting the front line and collaborated with Mr. Song Zhi of the pen corps to create a new play for the China Salvation Association of the Chinese Muslims. The name of the play is "Nation Above All." This play is set against the current era, highlighting the situation of the Han and Hui ethnic groups and the families of the Hui people themselves. As the invaders approach, everyone rises up to fight together under the premise of the nation above all and the country above all.</p>
<p>Under the lively writing of Mr. Song and Shu, and with the skillful guidance of the famous director Ma Yanxiang, its performance has won good reviews from audiences throughout the city, greatly arousing resonance and causing a sensation for a time.</p>
<p>On April 23rd, the Military Affairs Commission invited the Vanguards Drama Troupe to perform again at the Guotai Grand Theater in order to entertain the overseas Chinese returning from Nanyang to comfort the troops. At that time, many dignitaries and noble ladies drove to the Guotai in cars, enjoying the performance to their heart's content. The situation was unprecedentedly lively.</p>
<h3>"Army Joy" is Modernized</h3>
<p>Following the sensational "Nation Above All," a new script written with new techniques and performed with new theatrical technology, "Army Joy," appeared at the Guotai Grand Theater.</p>
<p>This script is quite bland in all aspects. However, under the principle that "drama is a comprehensive art," the editors integrated the three aspects of song, dance, and music into a whole. Moreover, under the director's agile skills, the scenery, lighting, and everything that can be seen, heard, and felt in the theater are integrated into one, so that the stage and the audience are consistent in feeling. This is a very valuable achievement.</p>
<p>No matter which audience member watches it, they will never forget the joy of the family, friends, and neighbors in the play enthusiastically joining the army. At the same time, they can even fulfill the task of promoting conscription and achieving the ultimate goal of the script.</p>
<p>This script was performed for four days, and it only stopped on April 14th from April 11th. The screenwriters were Yu Shangyuan and Wang Sizeng, the director was Yang Cunbin, and the actors were students from the National Drama School.</p>
<h3>Twenty Kinds of Ballads (8) The Palace of Eternal Life</h3>
<p>— Written by Yun, Illustrated by Xiuyan</p>
<p>The Palace of Eternal Life is a building in the Tang Palace.</p>
<p>On the evening of the Double Seventh Festival, Emperor Xuanzong of Tang and his beloved concubine Yang Yuhuan burned incense and made a vow here. As Bai Juyi's Song of Everlasting Regret says: "On the seventh day of the seventh month, in the Palace of Eternal Life, there was no one speaking in the middle of the night; in the sky, we wish to be birds flying wing to wing, and on earth, we wish to be trees with intertwined branches." The private life of the romantic emperor is still widely spread. Please have Hong Sheng compose a romance about it. Today's "Palace of Eternal Life Ballad" is adapted from the romance.</p>

<h3>Italy's Entry into the War and the Near Eastern Situation: Bloodshed in the Mediterranean Will Accompany the Tension on the Western Front</h3>
<p>— Shadow</p>
<p>Italy's battlefront: The situation in the Mediterranean is becoming more tense day by day. Most observers have come to the impression that once Italy joins the war, it will have to deal with three battlefronts. The first is in Europe, Africa, and France. The second is in the Balkan Peninsula. The third is in the Near East. After the German and Italian forces invade Yugoslavia, or perhaps even during the invasion, Italy will begin its offensive toward the Near East. According to the opinions expressed by Germany and Italy, victory in the Near East will be easily achieved. The Axis powers believe that the Allied forces in the Near East are very weak, while covert operations in the Near East only began four years ago.</p>
<p>Near East Under German Influence</p>
<p>Over the past four years, anti-British and anti-French propaganda has been passively carried out. Books, pamphlets, and newspapers have been sent by Germany and Italy, distributed to countless Arab people. The Italian radio station in Bari is the center of anti-British propaganda, broadcasting anti-British speeches five times a week. In 1936, when the rebellion occurred in Palestine, and in late September 1939 when the civil war broke out, Germany and Italy transported large quantities of arms to Palestine to collude with the rebels. Although the German authorities vehemently denied this and fabricated contrary facts, they have now admitted it. In 1940, Germany published a 100-page booklet, distributing it to tens of thousands of people in Europe, America, Asia, and Australia, titled "British Tyrannical Politics in Palestine."</p>
<p>Oil-Soaked Bloodstains</p>
<p>This kind of activity was clearly preparing for a future war, and the work of bringing certain Arab leaders closer to the Third Reich continued even after the outbreak of war in Europe. Because even after the outbreak of the European war, many neutral citizens living in Syria, Palestine, and Egypt were still engaged in this kind of outreach work. Thus, the Nazi Party is hoping that once there is war in the Near East, the British and French Allied forces will encounter many difficulties. In the autumn of 1938, German-controlled newspapers published news from Jerusalem: "The so-called British army is unable to suppress even a few thousand Arab rebels. How can such a country threaten us with war!" The entirety of this news is to prove how clever the Arabs are and how shameful the British are. "In these desert nations, Britain will need tens of thousands of troops to control the rebels," the author added at the end, making it clear how difficult it would be to deal with a real war. The territory is well-prepared, and there is German and Italian spy activity everywhere in the Near East. Italy may want to reap the rewards of the past four years of cultivation, hoping for Arab rebellions and work stoppages. The Arabs knew about this during the First World War and understood that, according to the account of the famous General Lawrence, they are clever students. In their recent rebellions, they have proven that "Lawrence of Arabia" was indeed accurate. In addition to wanting to control the Suez Canal, a hub of Eurasian transportation, what is most important to Italy in economic and military terms is connecting the oil fields of Iraq, Haifa, and Syria. When the Arabs rebelled, the connections to these oil fields were disrupted more than twenty times. Italy will do the same, because after controlling these nations, repairs will be very convenient.</p>
<p>The Near East Nations in a Dilemma</p>
<p>If Italy can win in Syria and Palestine, it will deal with the oil fields of Iraq, attack the British and French, control the Suez Canal, and further endanger Turkey. Within a few days, it could occupy the British-controlled island of Cyprus. Covert operations have long been prepared for the Near East nations. According to Hitler's predictions for any future war, Italy's ambition is to become the master of the Near East. Within these startling goals and the current situation, there are two major obstacles: the Allied land forces and the British navy. It would be dangerous if Italy underestimates the strength of the British and French forces in the Near East and overestimates the Arab rebellion. The situation of the Allied forces is completely different from that of the Turkish army in 1918, when Turkey was already weak and powerless, and decisions were made based on the wishes of the Arabs. The army in the Near East is a new force, which is very dangerous. And Italy does not have a figure like Lawrence who can create a rebellion. Even if it can achieve the goal of inciting rebellion, the reason why the Arabs rebel is to seek freedom and independence. They probably do not want to fight to break away from the British and French only to be ruled by Italy, right?</p>
<h3>Women of the World: French Women in Wartime</h3>
<p>French women do not wear uniforms during wartime, but they are more directly affected by the war than women in other countries. France has five million men serving in the military, so many of the tasks of the labor force need to be largely completed by women, especially in agriculture. This situation is even more true because, as in the last World War, the largest proportion of soldiers is supplied by the French countryside. Although agriculture is France's largest industry, no part of it is included in the preservation effort. Soldiers are granted large-scale leave from the army to work in agriculture, but only during a certain period of the year. During the rest of the time, all of France's enormous agricultural machinery is entrusted to the hands of women, the elderly, and young children.</p>
<p>French rural women have always been hardworking laborers, and now they have to work twice as hard, and their working days are even longer. Simple tasks such as taking cattle to graze are now often handled by old women who have been resting at home for a long time. Aside from the issue of money, there is now a strong motivation among French farm women: they want to "do things well" with their greatest efforts, and they want to ensure that the men do not feel any disappointment when they return home.</p>
<p>However, no matter how hard the farm women work, this is still a serious problem. The French government is now doing everything it can to maintain agricultural production at a very high level. In the last World War, wheat production fell sharply by more than half between 1913 and 1917. This situation must now be avoided. If the war continues for a long time, then rations will have an impact on agricultural production.</p>
<p>In the last war, France employed 400,000 women in its war industries, but it is estimated that this number will be even higher in this war. The aircraft industry employs a very large proportion of women.</p>
<p>In France, women are also employed on a large scale in all luxury industries such as clothing, leather goods, jewelry, and other embroidery. The prosperity of these traders largely depends on foreign markets, and in the implementation of blocking the export of German goods, many foreign markets, especially North and South America, are very promising to become new gateways for accepting French goods. However, on the one hand, French people have greatly reduced their consumption of luxury goods, and on the other hand, they are not actually encouraged by the government, coupled with the disappearance of wartime travelers, so no luxury goods merchant can operate as in peacetime.</p>
<p>After the tension at the beginning of the war gradually passed, the clothing factories in Paris immediately resumed operations, and the models in Paris came out as before. However, even the largest clothing factories in Paris now only employ one-fifth of their staff from peacetime. So how can those other highly skilled workers be employed? The Minister of Labor has thought of a solution and has now implemented it, which is to open many military uniform factories for 10,000 garment workers to sew uniforms and military attire.</p>

<h3>Messerschmitt Fighters</h3>
<p>— Xi</p>
<p>—The Soul of the German Air Force—</p>
<p>According to recent telegrams, Germany will use its air force as the main force for its offensive, implementing group air raids. The British and French authorities have also repeatedly warned soldiers and civilians to be prepared for air raids at any time. What Germany relies on is its superior air force, and what the German air force prides itself on is the "Messerschmitt" fighter. We often see news agencies from various countries mentioning this aircraft in the newspapers. What exactly is this aircraft like?</p>
<p>This aircraft is named after its maker, Willy Messerschmitt. Messerschmitt is only forty-one years old this year, younger than the famous American aircraft manufacturer Douglas. He has a sharp nose, golden hair, and was born in Augsburg, Germany. His hometown is a quiet city with a medieval flavor. He began learning to fly at the age of fifteen.</p>
<p>When British and German aircraft engaged in the first major air battle over the Heligoland Bight, it was discovered that Messerschmitt's new Me.110 aircraft was very different from the Me.109. It has two Daimler-Benz engines, can seat two or three pilots, and is equipped with relatively heavy weapons. There are four machine guns between the wings and two small grenade launchers. The speed is faster than the Me.109, about twenty miles per hour faster. The effectiveness of installing grenade launchers on aircraft remains to be tested.</p>
<p>But in general, its impact distance is better than machine guns, and a single shell is enough to kill the enemy. However, the hope of success for grenade launchers is not great at long distances, and because aircraft need to be equipped with such heavy grenade launchers, other weapons must be reduced. The effectiveness of this Me.110 Messerschmitt fighter still needs to be confirmed by the results of future engagements.</p>
<h3>A Brief History of Parachutes</h3>
<p>— Ju Chen</p>
<p>During the British war against the Boers in Africa in the late nineteenth century, German newspapers suggested using parachutes to carry riflemen to land and strafe the enemy's infantry, saying that victory could be assured. Although this suggestion was not valued, using parachutes to jump was not entirely a fantasy at that time. The principle of parachutes was understood by Easterners long ago. In the seventeenth century, a French person traveling in Siam described local performers who held large umbrellas and floated down from the top of a tower.</p>
<p>The first application of parachutes was by two famous Parisian aviators in the eighteenth century, named Blanchard and Garnerin. The two competed with each other. In 1797, Blanchard set a record by ascending into the sky in a balloon. Garnerin thought of surpassing him. On October 12, 1797, Garnerin used a parachute to descend from 2,236 feet above Parc Monceau, waving a flag. The audience acknowledged that Garnerin's skill was above Blanchard's. But parachuting cannot simply be used as a form of entertainment.</p>
<p>In 1808, a Polish aviator escaped from a burning balloon using a parachute. This was its first practical use. In 1912, Colonel Berry performed his first parachute jump from an airplane in Montmartre. By 1924, parachutes had become a major piece of equipment in aircraft. The lowest altitude for opening a parachute is 150 feet. The highest record for jumping down is currently 25,000 feet.</p>
<p>In this European war, the German parachute troops have shown great prowess. The troops jump out of airplanes at extremely high altitudes, and only open their parachutes when they are close to the ground. Otherwise, they would be floating in the air, not only unable to fight, but also becoming targets for the enemy's bullets.</p>

<h3>A Wedding in the Mountains of Lian County</h3>
<p>— Zhongyi</p>
<p>Singing to Seek a Mate: Life Still in a Primitive State; Head Ornamentation Resembling the Attire of a Savage Tribal Chief</p>
<p>Lian County, at the junction of Hunan and Guangxi, is seventy li from the city and is where the Yao people live in groups. When the author arrived there, it was the sixteenth day of the tenth lunar month, which was the day when the Yao people seek mates and get married. The process of their marriage is quite interesting. In the early morning, they gather in the square. First, the men sing loudly, singing songs that boast about their family background. "We have two hundred mu of good farmland, countless cattle, sheep, chickens, and ducks. If there is a good bride who fancies me! Come and live in my house (meaning home)! I will always bring you endless blessings, as if you have ascended to paradise!" Their voices are extremely loud, similar to those sung by Europeans. If a woman among them agrees with the man, she can freely step forward, first throwing the towel she is holding onto the man's shoulder, singing in harmony, and then holding hands shoulder to shoulder, murmuring sweet words, and then getting married in the evening. Their wedding is quite simple. The Yao people are strong and powerful, loyal and brave, but lack knowledge. Their living conditions are no different from the Middle Ages, and their clothing is especially peculiar. Their hair is tied on top of their heads, and they wear tall hats, with bare chests. The men wear long pants and leggings, while the women wear short pants. Both carry knives and swords, and hold long spears. Before jumping, they look very heroic. The village chiefs are all old men, with pheasant feathers inserted into their heads, almost like the role of a savage tribal chief in Beijing opera. It can truly be said that China is so vast that there is nothing that is not strange!</p>

<h3>Why Can Radio Stations Be Disrupted?</h3>
<p>— Ju Chen</p>
<p>Recently, when receiving broadcasts from the Shanghai Gospel Broadcasting Station, a whooshing sound was discovered, completely engulfing the station's broadcasts. This is the interference from a certain party that has been repeatedly reported in the newspapers. Those who cannot see Shanghai newspapers in other cities may suspect that their own radios are malfunctioning. The author listens to the station's English news reports and sermons every day, almost obsessively. Since this situation occurred, I had to turn it off and not listen, because on the receiving end, other interferences can be avoided by installing filters, but there is nothing that can be done about this interference.</p>
<p>Originally, radio stations have their own wavelengths or frequencies. For example, if one end of a rope is tied to a door and the other end is held in hand, if the hand is waved up and down, the rope will bend up and down into a wave shape. The distance between the crest of the front wave and the crest of the back wave is the wavelength; the rise and fall of a wave shape is a cycle, and the frequency is the number of cycles per second. Kilohertz is used as the unit. According to the International Radiotelegraph Convention, there cannot be two broadcasting stations with the same wavelength in the same location. (This is the general idea.) Otherwise, the broadcasts of the two stations will be heard at the same time, interfering with each other. Now the wavelength of the Gospel Broadcasting Station is 3571 meters. If a certain party emits radio waves with the same wavelength, but without music and language on them (in electrical terms, amplitude modulation is not used), then it becomes a whooshing sound.</p>

<h3>A Fair Discussion of International Price Issues</h3>
<p>— Baiming</p>
<p>In the past few days, some voices of the masses can be seen in the newspapers every day, and that is what has happened for the issue of commodity prices. When an unprecedented contraction of foreign exchange occurred on May 2, commodity prices in the market immediately rose by 20% to 30% under the pretext of the contraction of foreign exchange. Now that foreign exchange is relaxed, logically commodity prices should fall, but the commodity prices that have risen remain the same and have not decreased. As a result, some people who feel threatened by high commodity prices have expressed some unfair voices due to their personal suffering. This is human nature, and we should sympathize with them. Leaving aside the rise and fall of other commodity prices, this publication is a special publication for national goods, so let's talk about the price issue of national goods.</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of rising prices of national goods, the reporter has already discussed it in the previous issue. Now that foreign exchange is relaxed, why do prices still only rise and not fall? There are many people in the current society who hold this view, and some even scold national goods manufacturers for taking the opportunity to manipulate and profiteer. Of course, I cannot say that there is absolutely no one who takes the opportunity to manipulate commodity prices to profiteer, but there are also factors that prevent the prices of national goods from falling sharply. Why? First, we must know that the wartime price increase of national goods is inevitable. The price of rice is 49 times higher than before the war, and the price of coal is 78 times higher than before the war, while the ratio of price increases of national goods is much lower than that of rice and coal. The contraction of exchange rates and high commodity prices have made those engaged in the production and sales of national goods feel that it is more profitable to store raw materials or goods than to manufacture finished products or sell them. This is the first reason. Commodity prices rise under the pressure of the real situation, but the cost must be calculated when prices fall. In the past, because the cost was higher than the selling price and the prices of goods had not risen enough, even if foreign exchange is long, the cost is still high, so the price drop cannot be as responsive as an echo. This is the second reason. During wartime, due to inconvenient transportation and lack of materials, any commodity price has the possibility of rising, and this is not only the case for national goods. This is the third reason. Judging from the current market situation, high commodity prices mean a decrease in currency value. Those who have funds would rather store goods than lend money, manufacturers would rather store raw materials than engage in production, and vendors would rather store goods than sell them all. This kind of abnormal psychology under special circumstances is also one of the reasons why commodity prices cannot fall. What is even more advanced is that the more severe the contraction of foreign exchange, the more severe the outflow of raw materials. The more severe the outflow of raw materials, the higher the selling price of raw materials. In addition, the cost of power and labor is also high due to the increase in commodity prices. Although foreign exchange is long, the response to commodity prices is very small. This is also the reason why the prices of national goods cannot fall with the relaxation of foreign exchange. The above is reason, and it is also fact. Then, since we allowed national goods manufacturers to increase prices due to the contraction of foreign exchange, shouldn't national goods manufacturers automatically lower prices to reduce the burden on consumers when foreign exchange is relaxed? That's not how it works. The contraction of foreign exchange and the increase in commodity prices, and the relaxation of foreign exchange and the fall in commodity prices, this is a logical inference, but in fact, the rise and fall of commodity prices and the tightness of foreign exchange are only one of many reasons, not the only reason. The reason why national goods should reduce selling prices is one of the reasons, and reducing the burden on consumers and preserving the purchasing power that customers only have in order to achieve the coexistence of both production and sales sides is actually one of the meanings that national goods manufacturers should understand. Because the current high value of national goods, on the manufacturer's side, there is an inevitable pain, and on the consumer's side, there is the pain of being unable to buy. What is even worse is that the increase in national goods with the contraction of foreign exchange makes those who are enthusiastic about buying national goods switch to buying foreign goods, then it is like driving fish into the deep, and driving sparrows into the forest, which is not a blessing for the future of national goods. In these extraordinary times, those engaged in production and business should have the concept of serving the country and the nation. Although it is inevitable to willingly lose money, it is not the way to love the country and the people to use extraordinary times to obtain excessive profits. It must be known that the foundation of the national goods business is built in a large consumer group. If consumers' faith becomes increasingly weak and they are unable to buy, then even if the selling price of national goods is as high as the sky, who will ask? This kind of suicidal policy is also not what those who love national industries want to hear. Therefore, I believe that national goods increase prices due to unavoidable circumstances, but when circumstances permit, for the burden of consumers and for the reputation and business of themselves, they cannot only rise and not fall. Where to go, this is the decision of the Mingda in the national goods industry.</p>
<h3>Sincere Pharmaceutical Factory</h3>
<p>— Ta Zhen</p>
<p>History</p>
<p>The Sincere Pharmaceutical Factory has been established for twenty years. It was very small when it was first established. Later, capital was gradually expanded. The main factory was established on Route Massenet in the French Concession, and the first branch factory was established at No. 187 Hujunying Road in Nanshi, and the second branch factory was established at No. 132 Nanjing Street in Nanshi. After the Shanghai War broke out in the 26th year, the two factories in Nanshi were destroyed by artillery fire, but the authorities held a unyielding heart, and another branch factory was established on Avenue Avénard, and the Sincere Glass Instrument Department and Serum Vaccine Factory were established. At all costs and at great expense, various machinery and instruments were added from European and American countries, and efforts were made to develop them, which is worthy of admiration. The factory now has a total capital of 600,000.</p>
<p>Organization</p>
<p>The factory is a joint-stock company, with the highest being the board of directors, followed by the general manager, who is in charge of all factory affairs. Under this, there are accounting, propaganda, advertising, sales, transportation, storage, packaging, manufacturing, chemical research, documentation, general affairs, editing, printing, box, intaglio printing, coppersmithing, personnel, carpentry, and other departments, each with a director to manage it.</p>
<p>Employees</p>
<p>The factory has more than 70 employees and about 400 male and female workers, with female workers accounting for the majority. Most of the employees are from Ningbo, Dinghai, and local areas. The lowest level of education is junior high school dropout, and there are many college students serving. The manufacturing department, packaging department, etc., are all female workers, mostly around 20 years old, and there are also women in their 30s and 40s. The level of education is slightly lower, but they are very willing to work hard.</p>
<p>Business</p>
<p>The factory's business is extremely developed, with an average daily number of about 120,000. Although foreign ports are in the midst of the war, they are not inferior. Offices have been established in Hong Kong, Shantou, Fuzhou, Kunming, Tianjin, Beiping, Qingdao, Jinan, Chongqing, Singapore, and other places. There are representatives in Ningbo, Suzhou, Jinhua, and other places to promote business.</p>
<p>Equipment</p>
<p>The factory's equipment is extremely sophisticated. Most of the manufacturing department's equipment are the latest European, American, or German machines and instruments. The equipment in the chemical research department is also quite complete. The factory has special personnel to manage the machines and is equipped with repair craftsmen. When there is any damage, it will be repaired immediately. There are more than 20 electric heating furnaces, which are used exclusively for sealing the ends of injection liquid glass tubes. There are also baking rooms, which are equipped with radiators to bake various drugs. There are also Cibaoming Room and New Xihua San Room, and the equipment seems to be more substantial. The printing department has four printing presses and is equipped with movable type and English type to print price lists, brochures, notices, envelopes, etc. However, there are not many ordinary lead characters, and there is also an intaglio printing department, which is even smaller than the equipment in small printing shops in the market.</p>
<p>Introduction to National Goods Factories</p>
<h3>Full View of the Li Xing Great Wall Brand Thermos Factory - Latest Invention, Crystalline Material Bottle, Creating a Glorious Record of Domestic Manufacturing</h3>
<p>— Zhong Wangshu</p>
<p>The manufacturing of domestic thermos bottles has only a history of a few decades. Previously, we relied on imports, with Japanese goods especially flooding the market, and the outflow of profits was countless. Thanks to the efforts of insightful individuals who quickly caught up, we have now reached the point of self-sufficiency. In terms of product quality, we have even surpassed foreign goods. This is a remarkable historical creation, and the Li Xing Great Wall Brand Thermos Factory has truly borne the greatest responsibility. Here is an overview of the factory based on my visit.</p>
<p>Development History: In 1928, Mr. Gan Fengnan from Dinghai, with a small amount of capital, established a small-scale manufacturing factory on Dongyouheng Road. Through diligent management and careful research, its products surprisingly sold well in society. Later, to meet the increasing demand, a branch factory was established on Qingyang Road in Zhabei to increase production. In 1934, Mr. Gan further demonstrated his great ambition by building a new factory on Qimei Road. The scale was grand, the equipment was complete, and it was unparalleled in the industry. Unfortunately, the entire factory was destroyed by the August 13th Incident. However, Mr. Gan, with his spirit of perseverance, strived to recover. The following year, a new factory was rebuilt at the current address on Gordon Road near the Bubbling Well Road intersection. The internal equipment is even more typical of a modern factory. The factory's business, which initially had an annual turnover of only over ten thousand yuan, has now increased to over one million two hundred thousand yuan. Its sales reach not only within the country but also as far as Southeast Asia, Europe, and America. With its affordable and high-quality products, it has gained an excellent reputation overseas, so the future is very promising.</p>
<p>The crystalline material thermos bottle is the factory's unique product, based entirely on scientific principles. Its durable heat retention is truly creating a new page in the history of thermos bottles worldwide.</p>
<h3>Yunnan Porcelain Company</h3>
<p>— Sansan</p>
<p>The Central Relief Commission, in order to develop the porcelain industry in Yunnan, plans to establish a porcelain factory in Kunming and has sent He Jiefu, head of the city's refugee station, to Qujing for investigation. After the investigation, it was decided to establish the "Yunnan Porcelain Company" in Yunnan. The organizational method was drafted, and the company was established in Liaohu Town, Qujing, merging with the local existing Yongchang Porcelain Factory. The factory is one of the shareholders, with its original production equipment valued at 15,000 yuan in national currency as the company's share capital. In addition, the Central Relief Commission will contribute 15,000 yuan, and Yunnan porcelain merchants will contribute 15,000 yuan, for a total capital of 45,000 yuan. The Central Relief Commission designated Huang Bodu and He Jiefu as directors, and the Yongchang Porcelain Factory nominated Ou Chiqi to join. The porcelain merchants nominated representative Wang Ji to participate in the company's affairs. The company now owns more than 300 acres of clay land, and the raw materials are extremely abundant. The Relief Commission has entrusted Jingdezhen, Jiangxi, to hire 86 porcelain technicians to improve the porcelain within the company, so that it can be compared with Jingdezhen porcelain. The company held its opening ceremony on the 2nd of last month and began manufacturing. It is reported that the first phase of the plan aims to increase ordinary supplies to relieve the domestic porcelain shortage. The second phase of the plan is to produce a large number of fine art products for export in order to obtain foreign exchange.</p>
<p>Printing Ink Recipe - Chen Jiegang</p>
<p>Ingredients:</p>
<p>Methyl Violet: 1 gram</p>
<p>Alcohol: 10 cc</p>
<p>Glycerin: 50 cc</p>
<p>Water: 10 cc</p>
<p>Instructions:</p>
<p>Prepare the above ingredients separately. Add the methyl violet to the alcohol and stir with a rod until dissolved. After it is completely dissolved, add the glycerin and water together and mix well.</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<p>If the product color is too light, add more methyl violet. If it is too concentrated, add more of the other ingredients in proportion. If it lacks viscosity, add glycerin. If it is too viscous, add water or alcohol. If it does not dry easily, add alcohol.</p>
