<p>社評</p>
<h3>有關中共的傳說</h3>
<p>中國自由天地之間的中國共產黨，在精誠團結之中，政府統治之下，怎樣與他黨相處？怎樣對抗建貢獻？上海方面有關這一類的消息比較少，相反的，因果的，謠言比較多。尤在上海各報前此有了片段的紀述，略謂中國軍事當局命令新四軍調防冀察兩省以及魯北晋北，於是好像酵母發酵而爲種種說法：一因各報久無此類紀述，聞者感覺新奇，言者取爲談助。二因新四軍將校多數黨籍共產，使人直覺的浮起了一層政治意識，而與人類先天的政治趣味發生了感應。三因鄰近上海的遊擊戰區內，許多活躍而軍紀嚴明的遊擊隊伍，他們的番號在軍事原則上是秘密的，惟有新四軍漸成公開秘密；故在這一區域之內，一般人對於正式的游擊隊伍，不問他們究竟是何番號，一槪以爲是新四軍；這與成羣結隊，騷　閭閻的土匪對比之下，一般人以其對於正式游擊隊伍的珍惜愛護，乃異常關切於凡是牽涉新四軍云云的消息與謠言。四因軍隊調防，親者雖因抗建大業，軍令至上，情感適可而止於惜別；讐者却因處心積慮於乘瑕蹈隙，發爲挑撥離間的中傷流言。第四原因始終無所不用其極，何况前三種原因予以可乘之機？這亦是所謂『擴大官傳』吧；兩三日來，到處散播謂國共在中央怎樣的磨擦，在地方怎樣的衝突；宣傳不無效騐，引起了聞者憂疑。</p>
<p>對付凡百傳說，最忌成見，最忌盲從。有了成見，或一筆抹煞爲不確，或樂予輕信爲果然，其結果或與事實十足的相反。若使盲從，則無意之間成爲造謠言者的對象；若由盲從而一傳十，十傳百，以訛傳訛，則無意之間更成爲造謠言者的工具；即使盲從了而僅僅悶在心頭，則事實旣屬虛構，心頭的喜怒哀樂豈不太寃？擯除成見，力戒盲從，而又捨棄不了所聞的傳說，則最上莫上於勤求證據；根據了勤求所得的資料，或可明證傳說的確鑿，或可反證傳說的無根。資料不足，則用常識來判斷。、記者與讀者同在上海，對於自由天地之間有關中共的種種，沒有方法獲得足夠的資料來作明證或反證的憑藉，即如所傳新四軍調防云云，頗有可信之處，還是小妨鄭重的置之傳說之列。對付此類傳說，却不難以恒情恒理來決定信或不信。</p>
<p>第一，政治力量必以民衆爲基礎，民衆對於一個政治體系由服從而追隨而擁護，不在這一體系所有理論的長，權威的大，黨徒的衆多，却在這一體系昭示大信而爲民衆所信任；信任的厚薄衆寡與力量的大小强弱。成爲必然的正比。這是恒情恒理，亦是古今中外所絕對相同的政治鐵律，事實必受這一鐵律最後最公道的判決。中國共產黨莊嚴的宣示，承受三民主義爲立國原則，矢忠於抗建的國策；這已經成爲中國共產黨一切行動態度的最廣泛而淺顯的信條。以中共的抱負，當然無待於黨外的督促或壓迫，必自動的恪守信條，而不願失信於大衆，庶幾可望獲致更多民衆的追隨擁護。因此之故，無論從那一點，那一角度，觀測中國共產黨，凡屬有關中共背棄三民主義，妨礙抗建國策的凡百傳說，可以斷言其不確，人與人的摩擦，乃主黨與黨未能時時事事保持十分和諧，這倒是在恒情恒理之中；但以國共而論，亦有其最高限度。即任何摩擦與不和諧，必不致超過承受三民主義與完成抗建國策的界綫，這不是同情於主義與政策的成見，而是民衆對於共產黨愛憎親疏的標準，亦是可資占卜共產黨在中國的政治前途的論斷。退一步說，至少這在抗建時期是必然的。</p>
<p>第二『有關新四軍的問題。調防是兵家常事。軍令當然不附理由的說明。國家在平時，尤在戰時，軍令必歸一尊。必須貫澈。故假定傳說調防確屬事實，則問題決不在有無理由。亦不在新四軍奉令調防爲甘爲苦：非但問題不在此，且應視調防爲常事而斷言於其根本不應成爲問題。若謂牽涉政治，故不簡單。其實視此爲牽涉政治，纔是絕大錯覺。因爲軍隊雖由將校統率，而不是屬於所統率的將校：將校儘有其信仰，儘有其黨籍，而不是因爲將校籍的黨而軍隊便屬於黨；總之，是國家的軍隊。軍隊在平時，尤在戰時，不容分所謂畛域，不容有所謂從違，然後可以作戰，然後可以制勝；若分畛域，便成友敵之別，若有從違，便有順逆之殊。因此之故，奉令調防的新四軍，或對於原來防區，因時日與感情所積，或心理上留連不忍去，決不致行動上抗違不奉命。號稱抗命不去的，必是心懷叵測的集團，不是國家軍隊，不是正式的遊擊隊，不是眞的新四軍。容或有的問題，不易公開的大規模行軍，祇剩了調防的技術問題與時間問題。退一步說，軍令與軍隊行動，竟然包合了若干政治意味，則不但不應謂由常識判斷而置信於抗不調防的傳說；相反的，想像新四軍爲了政治意味而絕對願意調向冀察與魯北晋北，庶幾與那一帶的十八集團軍由接近而集中而力量雄厚。揆之恒情恒理，沒有軍隊甘願分散而單薄、亦即沒有置信於傳說的理由。</p>
<p>第三，關於所傳某某地方衝突云云，又非惟所傳將領姓名，軍隊番號，以及所在地點，「牛頭不對馬臉」，一聞而知其不可能，不可信；且就大義言，大勢言，在一個逼窄的區域之內，事實上，利害上，祗許兩軍對壘，不容三角鼎立。即使霎那間的鼎立，亦必立即因爲事實的利害的關係，由恩怨親疎而成爲友敵的雙方。由此說來，眞的共產黨籍將領所統率的軍隊會與日本軍隊勾結嗎？國民黨籍將領所統率的軍隊會與日本軍隊勾結嗎？絕友助敵，反顏相向，這是絕對小會有的事。容或有之，那是介乎中日兩軍陣地之間的游移分子，與中國共產黨何涉。</p>
<p>上述三種不可信的傳說，有前舉四種助長傳說的原因。此外，尙有一點，或足以加重內外各方對於傳說的注意力者：即中國抗戰，蘇聯予以同情與援助；則假定眞有所謂國共互相水火的問題，豈不影響及於中蘇國交，甚至影響抗戰前途？這一問題，中國與中國的友人。宜其關心；而最興會淋漓的，尤莫如期待中蘇交惡的人們。他們以爲中蘇交惡，便能從旁略取蘇聯的靑睞。個中得失，實應分別而論。在中國，以爭取獨立自由，保持主權領土的完整爲惟一目標；對內的一切措置，無論軍事政治經濟，對外的一切選擇，無論親之友之疎之敵之，無不以這一目標爲惟一尺度；即如有關上述種種傳說內的問題，亦必以這一尺度爲考慮決定的根據。在蘇聯，亦必以其整個國家的當前以及最近將來的利害關係來決定一切；即如他與德國妥協，予中國援助，兩事的方面絕對不同，而可信其基本理由完全一貫，至於中蘇國交與中國的國共相處，這是各有中心的兩個圓圈。雖兩中心相當接近，却永遠不會化合爲一。故中蘇兩國對於中國的國共相處，必然各取爲嚴肅考慮的對象，却並非決定一切的因素。因此之故，即使國共水火，不能便得中蘇交惡以及不利抗戰的結論，更不能便得蘇日交歡的結論。何况傳說不確！</p>

<h3>美國駐日大使格魯</h3>
<p>格魯大使在信仰和經歷方面，都是一個事業家。他輕視用金錢購買得來的爵位，像著作家輕視用金錢購買得來的書籍一般。有些儼然以外交家自命的人同他談話，格魯總是斤顧言他，吿訴他們說，「我知道硝酸鹽是什麼」他兩足蹀蹀，言語支梧，最後逼不得已，便道，「是的，我知道他們比現時的估價還要低些一</p>
<p>格魯幼時，曾息猩紅熱症，以致左耳失聰。她初入外交界時，哈佛大學敎授柯立芝曾贈以聾子外交家的雅號，格魯失望之餘，幾乎自殺。但他恢來知道如何善用他的所短。他從來沒有載過耳聾機，他床知道聽不見淺薄無識的言論，於他亦有好處，或是故作不聞，比較更好，譬如忿激之言，假使要向聾千反覆申說，豈不太覺可笑。他也曾感覺到這事的幽默面。在一九二二至二三年間，他曾代表美國，參加爲近東問題而召集的洛桑會議。土耳其外長伊斯默也是一個聾子，格魯常和他同坐一隅，高聲用法語談話，交換兩人的意見。</p>
<p>格魯大使果眞耳聾釗如何程度，沒有人確實知道。在幾年以前，當選菲律濱總統的奎松赴日游歷，日皇室舉行一個非正式宴會，招待奎松。席間排定位次，奎松坐在日皇之右，格魯坐在日皇之左。當諸人尙未就坐之前格魯的隨員指出了這個席次的錯誤。掌膳官卽向他解釋道，這樣坐法，可使皇上的言語，容易進入，格魯不使不聾的一耳。格魯聞聽此言，便道，「休要胡說！皇上向我說的話，不論何語，我都可以聽見的呀」</p>
<p>格魯夫人不喜歡這張虎皮的怒目相向，亦有原因。她本出身波十教望族，禀性溫柔，舉止嫺雅，對於粗魯的情感表現，不論是人是虎，總非她姓之所好。像她這樣。沉靜他寬厚，溫文，和易，可算是一個十全十美的外交家夫人。格魯和她結褵經過，更是代生平一般佳話。</p>
<p>他取道西班牙回波士敦不久，在某次宴會中，請人向新自日本歸來的林特蘭小姐介紹，不料鬼使神差，竟誤介紹了愛麗斯潘萊小姐。這位愛麗斯小姐非但會僑居日本，而且還是第一個開闢日本，具有大無畏精神的老潘萊的姪孫女。格魯一見傾心，便開始向她追求</p>
<p>他覺得在開羅的工作，非特所入有限，（軍俸不過六百元，），而且乏味得很，乃一意追求愛麗斯，最後在電報中向她求婚，竟蒙接受。他就趕緊潛回波士敦。在一九〇五年十月七日結婚前數小時，愛麗斯父親正顏厲色的把格魯引到餐室，推開一窗扇子，對他說道，「這是你最後逃走的機會了，我決不會告訴一個人。」格魯一身是胆，距離猛虎四天，尙且鎭靜不驚些些小事，當然無足介意了。</p>
<p>格魯在外交界中，一帆風順，由開羅升任駐墨西哥公使館三等秘書，又調駐俄大使館三等秘書，駐德大使館二等秘書，和駐奧公使館秘書。一九一四年戰雲籠罩之時，復調回柏林。上次歐戰卽起，任裘拉特大使的參贊。在德國無限制潛艇戰爭最緊張的三個月中，他担仟代辦之職。他是美國人中最後離開柏林和維也納的一個人。</p>
<p>上次歐戰將結束時，他在華盛頓國務部任西歐司長，旋卽奉派與威爾遜總統的特使好司上校同赴歐洲，參加停戰談判。這次出發，異常秘密，他的嬌妻愛子，正在漢考克地方避暑，竟完全沒有知道他的計劃。直到他抵達大西洋彼岸以後。方始得悉。休戰條的簽字以後，他就一躍而爲特派大使和全權公使的職銜，担仟和平會議美國代表團秘書。</p>
<p>格魯所作的游記，使人讀了好似一冊旅行便覽。他的夫人，曾在二十個都市中成立家庭，他的兒孫輩，按照年代的先後，誕生在瑞士京城，紐約，東京，和加拿大的渥太哇。各種運輸器具，從人力車到飛機，他都坐過。他曾搭載過全世界最華麗的巨舶，和乘客表上祇有格魯君與中國人九十三名的小輪船。　（未完）</p>

<h3>日排斥各國權益　謀獨佔在華貿易　華北及長江幾全遭統制　上海方面亦加緊進行</h3>
<p>關於日本排斥第三國在華樣益、近更變本加厲、華中方面、日本已組織若干專賣性質之公司、獨佔進出口貿易、華北方面、則藉「聯合準備銀行」實施滙兌上及貿易上之統制、</p>
<p>貿易統計　施用烟幕</p>
<p>據本埠商界消息、華北對外貿易、已爲日本所獨佔、因日人在貿易統計上施用烟幕、故詳細情形、尙未爲各界所週知、據記者向關係方面探詢、凡日圓集團以外各國貨物運入華北、日人管理下之海關於編製統計時、均將各項進口貨物之價格、（起岸價格、以外幣計算），按暗盤滙率折成國幣、再以國幣對金單位之比率、合成金單位、與上海海關採取之紀錄、辦法不同、</p>
<p>英美商業　實際减退</p>
<p>因此如上海美貨進口一萬金單位、照天津之計算辦法、則列爲五萬金單位、故在表面上、如以統計爲根據、華北英美進口貨物、並未减少、實際則减退甚鉅、惟日方此種朦混辦法、僅能掩蔽一般中外人士之耳目、而在華英美商人及外交官員、自均已洞察其內容、</p>
<p>長江流域　日商獨佔</p>
<p>最近一華北聯合準備銀行」統制進出貿易及　兌、日益嚴厲、進口須經許可、出口須經結匯、英美商行均已遭受嚴重打擊、華中方面、則長江航運之開放、一再延宕、揚子江流域淮出口貿易、均爲日商獨佔、第三國無揷足餘地、</p>
<p>上海又復　加緊統制</p>
<p>僅上海一帶、外商尙能自由、但最近日方父復加緊統制、「江寗銀行」亦定期開張、故今後日方勢必將華北之排斥外商辦法、推行於華中各地、而英美在華經濟利益之中心、亦岌岌可危矣、</p>
<h3>義輪卡里尼號　棉花被扣</h3>
<p>英文大美晚報云、義商內河輪卡里尼號、（七十五噸）、載有的値四萬元之棉花來滬、被此間日海軍當局指爲求獲日方「許可」、而從內地載出棉花、致今（廿六日）晨遭其扣留、查已往二閱月來此間日海軍當局所扣之軸心國輪、至卡里尼號已屬第七艘、其餘六艘。計義輪四艘、與德輪二艘、現皆被覊於南市水柵附近日海軍「水上警署」前、據今晨所悉、卡里尼號從長江口各口岸載棉甫返上海、　泊外灘、突有日水兵趕到、登卡里號勒令下駛至日方「警署」前、閒此項棉花、係本市某華商行事前向海關領得必要之結單後</p>
<h3>特二院未結案件　正商救濟辦法　或將轉移特一法院辦理　各級法院當局正洽商中</h3>
<p>法租界內兩法院自於上月撤退後、所有未結之案、悉已暫予中止、茲據平明社記者昨向司法界方面訪悉、司法行政部最高法院分庭及高二分院等對於十一月八日以前市民上訴於高三分院未審結之案件、及不服第二特院判決之當事人擬再上訴者、正力謀救濟辦法、自特二區撤退之各級法官、最近曾與最高法院分庭及高二分院當局有所洽商、不久或可擬定具體辦法、法租界兩法院之未結案件、移交公共租界法院繼續辦理、</p>
<h3>香港入境禁令　續請展期</h3>
<p>香港英當局爲防止不良份子潛人港地、於日前曾頒布限制人口入港條例、原定本月十八日實行、嗣經香港移民延期於下月十四日實行、茲據航業界消息、現港滬等各地航尚、順廢歷年關、商人來往頻繁、自港當局請求再予延期實行、惟是否邀准、現尙未悉、</p>
<h3>平準會按旣定政策　應付黑市外匯　正當貿易可照法價結滙　英美銀行業已拒絕掉期</h3>
<p>上海環境特殊、如海關稅收被截、日貨輸入淪陷區域、黑市外滙投機、內地及租界中之資金逃避、中國政府在租界上無法執行權力、因不受政府之直接統制、對於外滙多從事於投機、蓋政府若照往昔滙率維持、則結果便利於非降需品之進口商、及自淪陷區中搜括法幣套取外滙者、對非必需品之進口商供給資金、等於幫助資金之逃避、便於套取外滙者、使其大獲厚利、當然皆非政府所應為、今平準外滙基金管理委會、對上海黑市外滙之維持措置、係根據政府旣定政策而行</p>
<p>保護合法　商人利益</p>
<p>對於抗建不必要之進口貨、以及日本製造之物品、不得不施以限制，惟對外貿易、純以是否有關於國家民族生命之需要爲標準、所以對合法之中外商人、將予以種種便利、合法商人祗須依照請求外滙辦法、向外滙發付審查委員會請求、卽能獲得較上海黑市爲高之商　外滙、此爲中國政府保護合法商人利益、不使　受黑市損失之辦法、中國政府對進口貨仍予獎勵輸入、惟限於必需之品、</p>
<p>拒絕外匯　套利掉期</p>
<p>上海黑市滙率、雖經平準外滙基金管理委員會與友邦各銀行合作設法維持、實爲維持各友邦在華之正常貿易、惟各友邦商人因正當貿易需要外滙、必浪備有證明文件、向各友邦銀行購買、至於外滙套利及掉期、早經洋商銀行公會與華商銀行公會，議決一致拒絕、旨在使投機者無法施其技、黑市外滙得以持久穩定、今英商滙豐麥加利美商花旗等銀行、以及華商經營外滙業務之各銀行、均已遵辦、</p>

<p>小麥運淪　陷區救難</p>
<p>上月間由美裝運來滬之米麥二萬包、除上海已分配完竣外、其餘救濟常錫蘇各淪陷區者、因出口手續、尙未辦竣、迄未起運、現該項出口「涌行證」等、業已辦妥、故美紅會滬會已定日內裝運分發救濟、此次救濟淪陷區難民者、以小麥爲大宗、上海方面、則以食米爲多、</p>

<p>米行茶會市塲昨晨循例於九時開做後、一般米糧掮客、仍持由所委代銷米糧貨樣、擬入塲居間卒被門警拒絕入內、以致滯留塲外、惟若輩秉性難改、竟在塲外暗中兜售、誠屬非法、塲內雖仍人頭簇簇、竟至有市無貨之局面、照限買賣者、仍鮮有所聞、蓋因買者尙以評價太高、若在門市出售、獲利甚尠、反之、賣方猶以評價太低、故意居奇不肯將所有囤貨輕易抑價出籠、而塲外暗盤成交、反較塲內爲多、致米價受牽制、無法撳低、</p>

<h3>沈達齡　講述五教同點　論色鬭得三戒精義相合</h3>

<p>老子說不尙賢、使民不爭、亦戒鬥、戒瞋之意、不貴難得之貨、使民不爲盜、亦戒得戒貪之意、不見可欲、使民心不亂、大概包括財·色·兩關、而戒色·戒痴·之意、尤爲顯明、此儒釋道所同也、</p>
<p>耶敎舊的內摩西兩次宣佈十誡、有不可殺人·不可姦淫·不可偷盜·不可貪戀·等語、殺人爲鬥爭之結果·姦淫·偷盜·貪戀·卽是色·痴·貪·得、此耶敎亦與儒釋道同也、</p>
<p>古蘭經云、不論隱顯、遏止淫欲、又云毋流血，毋爭地逐人、又戒爲人鬥爭、又戒嗜利貪黷、爲獲禍之道、此回敎亦與儒道釋耶同也、論語少時血氣未定、故戒色、壯則血氣方剛、故戒鬥、老則血氣旣衰、故戒得、因年齡之不同、血氣之變化、而隨時致戒、至爲切實、</p>
<p>涅槃經以不凈觀洽貪、以瞋、以因緣觀治痴、敎人修養之道、亦至爲切實、總之、五敎之對於三戒、雖持論詳略不同、而敎人免於爲惡則一、講畢、卽開基本社員會、聞下期一月十二日、仍由沈達齡君講五敎之同點、</p>

<p>麵粉　昨日洋粉市况、尤趨堅穩、蓋自假期前一度回降後、人心依然帶硬、實由於目下國外來源、頗有顧盧、本粉供源缺乏之際、惟有洋粉馬首自瞻、是以新到之大批洋粉、均被行號執住不脫、昨開北洋幫轉口去路頗活、成交共計一萬四五千包、計開花鳥鐘樓牌二十二元五角、及花神牌二十二元八角、高牌野猪因本客銷活價須二十三元一角、市面脚地尙挺、</p>
<p>小麥　昨市堅穩如常、蓋以國內外供源均寂、租界存棧貨更感缺乏、是以售手居奇、喊價參差不一、華廠與日廠均感原料不數、終以無貨可購爲憾、故市面形勢、不脫靜堅之局、</p>
<h3>油市　油價逐日漲　一元一斤油</h3>
<p>昨日油市、因金市外滙等無正式市面、故市塲中交易稀少、人心乏新刺激、致興毫無、豆油行情續修元譜、花生油平定、至午後趨勞轉活、因傳金價暗盤緊漲、人心震動、市氣回好、靑島生油獨見挺秀、出於產價頻升、申市亦升、計成交靑島生油六十桶、價爲一百二十八元至二十七元五角、新貨五十桶、價爲一百三十元、膠州生油三十件、價爲九十五元、新貨五十件、價爲九十七元、烟台聽裝新生油五百聽、價爲一百二十五元大連豆油五十桶、價爲一百十六元五角、一月上交二百五十桶、價爲一百十七元至一百十五元五角、復至一百十七元、一月下交三百桶、價爲一百十七元七角半至一百十七元、收盤復升半元、二月份二百桶、價爲一百十九兀至十八元、及大有廠豆油五十担、價爲九十四元、鬥莊生油已售一斤一元、豆油每元一斤一兩、一元一升米、一元一斤油、且無好米好油吃、　哉其枉、</p>
<h3>糖市　冬霧靑漲一元</h3>
<p>昨糖市趨勢平疲、繼續轉鬆、公會劃盤、現貨二四組白外棧復小數角、爲七十九元三角、荷赤現貨初緊後半、爲六十四元三角至六十四元、太古車白B嘜前日未做出、昨以七十八元半成交、比廿四日降二元、CX嘜七十七元二角、DY嘜西棧七十六元半、小一元、東棧老貨七十五元半、冬霧靑續有開出、價爲六十一元、升起一元、</p>
<h3>南北貨　徽蜜棗銷活　價又漲十元</h3>
<p>徽州蜜棗、近來到貨仍缺、市上存底亦稀、而各方需要尙屬活動、故售盤續向上展、昨市徽工禿禿售二百六十元、比前升十元、上下檔照例加退、</p>
<h3>雜項　火柴步步高　此上週高四十餘元　肥皂行市亦見上漲</h3>
<p>肥皂市價、近在各物趨漲聲中、致價亦重向榮、刻下固本皂每箱市售已至二十三元五角、白祥茂二十一元六角、黄祥茂皂十七元六角、</p>
<p>火柴連日頻漲不已、因原料來源缺乏、廠方不能儘量供給、生產形於停頓、致價格直上、昨如美麗牌售三百六十元、鳳凰火柴三百五十元、二等雜牌三百二十五元、三等雜牌三百十元、比上週漲起四十餘元、</p>
<h3>藥材　藥芡歉收高張</h3>
<p>藥芡本屆新貨牧成較歉、故來源極爲稀少、故見新後市價逐步向上、最近開出一批、竟　八十五元之高峯、查七月間陳貨不及四十元、前後相比漲起一倍以上云、</p>
<h3>百合干回好</h3>
<p>百合干前以需要呆滯、售盤曾到五十元之譜、但照成本而論、必須虧耗、故到貨日稀、而行方手貨亦觀望少出、因此遂見轉機、逐步回好、現市已到六十五元、前後漲起十五元之多、　勞漸　、</p>
<h3>紗花　棉紗再見新高價　最高至一千四百二十五元　紗價如此棉市亦將受影響</h3>
<p>前日回疲之紗市、今則又見前進矣、此因取引所中收盤時行情轉昂、且遠期價仍出一千三百元關外、與雙馬僅差一百餘元、所以多頭心思頗挺、同時實際銷路較活潑、惟同業中有一部份對於雙馬上漲、殊不領盆、爲其太昂之故、因此而意態傾向空頭、但有一部份將雙馬拋出、掉進雜牌紗、至於「外客方面」專門收進雙馬廠單、其餘棉紗絕無進意、可想兩方之心情大有天淵之別、所以市盤一現高峰、所謂內行者紛紛拋賣、而低價一來、買戶萬量收納、及至午後、紗市又見新高峯也、</p>
<p>雙馬晨開、空方殊為活動、因外匯黃金均休市、市况頗呈假痴假呆之象、叫喊雖低、然籌碼並不踴躍、首盤價爲一千三百八十五元、一度跌至一千三白八十二元、然「外客方面」及生大號仍來拖進、但檯面之神氣依舊渙散、在此一千三百八十五六元徘徊、爲時甚久、旋以籌碼轉緊、昂至一千三百九十四元、此價立定多時、詎料至十一時半以後、因檯面上賣者寥寥無幾、漲風鬨然而起、頓刻穿出一千四百元關外、同時客方生意尙佳、昂至一千四百〇九元收盤、查半日間成交統計四千八百三十五包、行情二十支雙馬漲二十五元、茲將各幫口買去之額量分別如左、同行四六五〇　香港　二六〇江西　一〇　厦門　一〇寗波　五　統計四、八三五</p>
<p>午後紗市大爲興奮、且漲風驟盛、二十支雙馬價始做一千四百二十二元、因人心惶恐、據言多頭在前市疲檔中又復收進、所以浮空不安、而抵補所致、旋後做一千四百十五元、再見新高峰、</p>
<p>現棉情况、依然堅挺、惟廠万採辦不旺、目高價不喫、二則無投機心思交易、所以情形遠不及紗市之昂、不過紗價如漲、棉市當然不能看鬆、或者時間緩一步也、</p>
<h3>疋頭　大衣呢尙俏俐</h3>
<p>大衣呢昨日趨勢尙稱俏俐、並不因國曆年底關係而轉疲、蓋其市貨母多、本廠無出品、往後定到艱難、且成本加昂、兼鑒買方進意、俱抱隨吐隨　、顧客多待天氣嚴寒及破舊不堪方再添製、隨造成銷路日比拌年爲延長、交易多零少整、刻市黑灰藏靑大衣呢·開士面·銀搶·拷花等大衣呢、因之市氣皆俏、大盤行市悉皆挺秀、</p>
<p>又棉布今日有二十四件、運往仰光、</p>
<h3>煤炭　印煤扶搖直上</h3>
<p>印度烟煤、前週因某洋行大量吐出、達四千噸、市上現貨充盈曾回跌至二百念三四元、頗多售出、直至前日因外匯暴縮、各行卽停止出售、老棧單亦把持絕跡、價乃扶搖直上、印度篩塊每噸已喊二百四十元、統煤二百念五元、送釗客戶、另加車力、惟成交極缺、有行無市、</p>
<h3>白煤停止打單　暗盤又抬</h3>
<p>火爐白煤、近一週來、因天氣和煦，銷塲大减、以致本街生意、十分淸淡、但經理行家、鑒於滙市連日猛縮、貨價又擬看高、停止打單、關住不放、並通告催出、安定巳久之人心、又爲緊張、暗盤乃乘機抬上、好起近十元行情、門莊發客、每噸二百六十四元、尙未更動云、</p>
<h3>票據退票時間之商榷</h3>
<p>— 應永玉</p>
<p>讀季潤模君票據抵用時間上一個小問題後，因想到票據退票之時間問題。華商銀行票據之淸算時宜，大都集中於票據交換所，季君所言，卽指目前交換很票情形而言。至銀錢業同業退票，本應於當晚退回，然後互相淸算，才爲合理，至今各業同業中退票，仍當日淸理。惟銀行業退票，在戰前，票據交換所亦規定至當晚八點爲止，各行均派有專員駐行接洽退票事宜。戰後因各銀行頗多遷至西區營業，路途較遠，往返需時，交換所乃變更辦法，將交換銀行退至該所，時間以當日下午五時爲止（五時後不收），及决日上午十時前。經此變動後，票據退回至提出交換之銀行，大都已在次日上午十時之後，有時遲至十一時左右。至於收錢莊及非交換銀行票據，因係該所當日分別派人收取，故有退票，當日亦卽退回，但退至托收之銀行因亦有當日收到，而大都均在次日上午九時至十時間。至於洋商銀行（卽外灘銀行）票據，交換所收入後，均轉託中國銀行代理，當時並由中行派員駐所料理分配，然收票截止時間仍提早一時（星期六十時爲止，平時十一時爲止。）但至各洋商銀行退票、陸續各別退回至霞飛路中國銀行，由該行分批飭司退回交換所，再由交換所分別退回於托收行，經此種種轉折，遂使時間漫無一定，早則十時也有，遲則十二時下午二時不一定。</p>
<p>查洋商銀行彼此間之退票時間，照目前辦理，普通均在次日十時以前。華商銀行與洋商銀行開有往來戶者，收票時間，平時以當日十二時為止，星期六為上午十一時；遇有退票，在次日十一時以前已可收到；逾　時間，不再收受。</p>
<p>總之，目前交換所之洋商銀行票　退票時間無一定標準，自有改善之必要，鄙見所及，以爲</p>
<p>（一）交換所收人之洋商銀行票據，若仍委託中國銀行代理，所應與中國銀行規定一退票時間，於每日上午十時，由中國銀行將各洋商銀行退票彙齊，至十時一刻，派汽車送交交換所，過時不收，交換所於十一時前，退還托收行。</p>
<p>（二）爲簡捷計，交換所不再委託中國辦埋，而直接與洋商銀行開立往來戶。</p>
<p>由上言之，無非求退票時準確敏捷，則與星期六下午銀行休業之票據抵用問題，亦不無得，相當之解決辦法矣。</p>

<h3>這不過是冬天</h3>
<p>— 嚴貞</p>
<p>媽在包爸的夏布長衫，紙頭㗭嗦發響，媽把眼睛溜了一週，爸仍舊在那裏看報，弟弟蹲在地上看些什麽似的，媽拿了圍巾，把紙包放在裔下挟着，又看了姊姊一眼，走出去了。</p>
<p>姊姊偏着頭，眼光就轉到天花板上，一大堆透着黃黃的水跡，心里忖：爸辦事的地方，自從那天來了幾輛車子〕，爸就失業了！到現在，差不多要二個月來了，爸說有幾個爸的同事，仍舊好好兒的，還在那里辦事；一說到他們，爸的氣就上來了！常常拍　拍凳　，呸！這些不知恥的東西，我可就寗願一家餓死！……哥哥是有志氣的，他要到內地去了。他說過的：「這不過是冬天！」</p>
<p>「姊姊！媽到什麽地方去了！」弟弟不知什麽時候立在姊姊身邊的。</p>
<p>「呃，媽嗎？媽——噢，媽給你買東西去了！」姊姊陡的給楞住了，停了停，哄着說</p>
<p>「媽是不是給我買荷包蛋去的？姊姊！」弟弟最歡喜吃荷包蛋。</p>
<p>「唔！——」姊姊想不出說什麽，含糊地答應了一聲。</p>
<p>弟弟跳着玩去了，姊姊拿起檯子上的活計，聽見爸重重的吧了一口氣。</p>
<p>門開了，冷風直撲進來。姊姊打了個寒噤，放下手里的活計，那件改給哥哥穿的，是爸的舊布衫。媽從小菜場回來了。拎着竹籃，𩓐子上繞着的那條褪色了的圍巾，已經拉到鼻尖上。走進來，順手把門關了。弟弟丟下紙人，趕忙跑過去，拉着媽：</p>
<p>「媽！你給我荷包蛋買來了嗎？」</p>
<p>媽不響，放下籃子，搓搓手，先把圍巾除了。姊姊看見媽裹在破棉襖里的肩胛聳着，身子索索抖。</p>
<p>「怎麽？又是麵！每天吃麵，我不要！我要吃飯！我要吃荷包蛋！」弟弟把籃子上遮着的報子拿開，看見麵就嚷起來了。</p>
<p>「乖乖！別吵，別吵，你要荷包蛋，媽明天買。」媽低聲說，飄了爸一眼。</p>
<p>弟弟哭了。身子扭來扭去，板壁給撞得僕僕地響。</p>
<p>「好弟弟，不要哭了。媽今天忘記了，明天一定會買給你的。」姊姊把弟弟抱起來，拿衣角擦着弟弟臉上的淚水說。</p>
<p>坐在壁角里的爸，把手里的申報望檯上一甩，重重的嘆了一口氣。</p>
<p>烏雲凝得厚厚地，天緊綳了臉，北風撒野地拉長着喉嚨，天要下　了！對過人家的玻璃窗上，幌着紅紅的火光，彎彎曲曲向上昇動著，伸在墻外的烟囱裊裊的出烟了。</p>
<p>哥哥說的：「這不過是冬天！」姊姊想着，不自覺地把懷里的弟弟，摟得緊了些。</p>
<h3>擬豫言</h3>
<p>— 水冗</p>
<p>市塲上新年「紅盤」，都發見高價：蛤赤七千多，美　　五　　，紗花，糧食均猛騰。以後新高價當層出不窮。蛤赤祇少　一萬元。以符「萬金」之俗　。</p>
<p>某聞人又發表談話，勸勉集團購米，並再三函申其「大公無私」之私衷。函文洋洋數千言，極「　誠」之致。次日米價又大漲。當局不得已復　放「限價」。是日　大雪，貧民多人爭以雪充飢。</p>
<p>××等敎養院之主持人，為「表明心跡」起見，聯合招待各界。席間申明：「　有舞弊情事，必遭　殛火焚。如有謊騙，死　當　割舌地獄。」聽者莫不動容。</p>
<p>當局以「出超」過巨，又有「加捐」之舉。大房東。二房東乃想率加租。三房東　救無門，訴之「房屋糾紛仲裁委員會」。登記。調查之後，判云：「時值非常，宜同舟共濟。房東　亦出於無奈。」當局至是，佈告嚴禁大房東。二房東非法加租。</p>
<p>公共汽車。電車又加價，唯搭客銳減。街頭陡增「安步當車」者×萬人，途為之塞。</p>
<h3>抑止米價·制裁「米棍」</h3>
<p>— 仟炯</p>
<p>前成都市長楊全宇因　積民食，由車法機關依法判死刑。這是陪都的奸商處理法，而從那段　訊中我們可以得出三點：一，是操縱食糧，擾亂治安不但妨礙國策，而且是幫助　別人的舉動。二，罪犯僅是　麥「數百石」，而就處死刑；咱們上　的「　積專家」所積的白米何止千萬包，尚且逍遙法外。三，奸人購買的貨物，已被稱為「贓物」，可是，我們上海的奸商，却堂而皇之的把贓物放在倉庫裏而自由自在，得意忘形。在這段短短的電訊中，我們感到「此時此地」的法紀　然，和「那時那地」的軍法嚴明，不禁使我們　然失聲，　道我們在上海的中國人竟如此的沒有天良，置民族國家於不顧，而專把個人的「安富　榮」置於第一位嗎？</p>
<p>可是，我們不是說，我們　讓他們剝　下去，而「束手無策」。我們上海的四百五十萬市民都有着為了「生存」而提出要求的必要，我們覺得有下列的兩點好做：</p>
<p>第一，將上海的所謂「米棍」，也可以用法律的判決。</p>
<p>第二，將上海各倉庫所　積的米糧，全　取出，照進價實行公賣。</p>
<p>上　這兩種辦法，第一種是比較「　行」的，因為他們有着　勢力的根源；可是第二　辦法倒　還是有效的制裁，祇要我們每個人一致要求，地方當局是會更進一步的嚴　奸商，和實行存糧公　，我們相信是可以迅速實行的，何况這辦法對維持治安本身講也有着　大的幫助！</p>
<h3>左右開弓</h3>
<p>— 馬戈作</p>
<h3>章臺柳</h3>
<p>— 顧明道</p>
<p>柳如是將房門輕輕掩上，勉強帶笑，對牧齋說道：「我與你　在床上也好。生則問衾，死則問穴，也使你在泉　之下，不至寂寞呢」。牧齋又道：「　上自　，舌必伸吐，這也是十分難受的。我想起後面花園裏有個池塘，不如投身清流，表示節　的清高。」如是見牧齋這樣不好，那樣也不好，心裏很是不快。遂道：「相公既已決心死節，飲　好，懸　也好，投池也好。我們就去投池。」遂去吩咐下人在大廳上擺設香案，要陪牧齋去焚香叩頭，　　了祖先，拜了先皇帝，然後從容殉節。一會兒下人來報，得案已設，請下樓跪拜。柳如是遂走至牧齋身　將　手去扶他，說道：「從容就義，還我清白，今天是我們成仁之日，請相公勿再猶豫。」錢牧齋道：只是我還有一件　未了哩。」柳如是不出一怔道：「相公有什麽事來了？牧齋道：平生所為詩文不可謂不多，前者和你校對整理了一大半，尚有新作未及增入，我死之後，子孫可　我　版，留　　世，所謂馬死留骨，人死留名。可惜還有些未曾凌事，最好也把他辦好了，吾心方安，「柳如是一聽這話，忙聲哎喲，又道：「這是什麽時候，還有心思去整理叢　嗎？眞有價值的文章宛如金石，雖然暫時埋沒，而他的光彩決不會掩淺，終有人發見而傳布出來的，蘇東坡代蘇舜欽作序，也曾如此論及，而况文以人傳，假使相公殉國而　，你的大名　留宇宙，還怕這些文章不傳於世嗎？何必鰓鰓過慮及此？否則秦　嚴嵩的文章何以不為世人所重，而流傳人間呢？現在相公已決定一死，更要戀戀不忘到這個事情，　道相公的死志到今日還不決嗎？前幾天我　人說某地有　個士人也因不願為他人奴，相約同死。到那日某士人去約他的朋友同死，但他的朋友說，後　豬　裏　　着的許多豬尚未上食，恐怕餓死了不能　錢，所以請某士人稍持，等他去喂了豬，然後同去赴難。某士人聽他朋友這樣一說，便知他朋友死不成了，立即拂袖而去。相公你不要生嗔，你今日若還要戀戀於詩文集時，那麽又何異於士人喂豬呢？　柳如是說了這話，雙眉緊鎖，更露出不快活的樣子。　（二二）</p>

<p>逰藝界</p>
<h3>評「孔夫子」</h3>
<p>— 許達明</p>
<p>不能吾認費穆先生的導演技術是有着傑出的手法的。過去我們在「天倫」一片中已經領略過他的作風——對人物個性的刻劃，四週氛圍氣的製造而幫助故事的發展，以及運用「特寫」的宇法而來抓住每個片斷的中心。今天，我們在「孔夫子」裹除了「特寫」的塲面沒有看到顯著的發揚以外，對劇中主要角色的刻劃和氛圍氣的造成，這裏有着很好的成就。頭回把飯救濟貧民和用砍來的柴再去向別別別人「調」飯充饑，這是够人感動的了，而在這一故事的前面，還挿以陽貨，少正卯的殘忍——把懸樑高吊的死人當「箭把子」來開玩笑的正反相映法，是襯出了當時的「奸臣賊子」如何瘋狂地在屠殺生　，而援救人民的到底是那些人。但我們感到遺憾的是費穆先生在更重要的一面的忽略——偉大的羣衆塲面——人民對那些人有好感和擁戴；對那些人是切齒的痛恨和非誅之不可的情緒，這裏我們沒有看到。</p>
<p>至於導演對演員的處理，首先我們同意費穆先生的打破「明星制」的優良作風。在「孔夫子」裹，我們就沒有看到有誰的戲特別吃重的地方，即使是飾孔子的唐槐秋，在許多塲合上，張翼的子路倒反比它吃重，當然孔子的戲的儘量　少或許還有着其他的原因（怕人特別別別宜揚「孔敎」等等）。子路的突出，我們認爲是導演者想用子路來激發觀衆的戰鬥情緒，這用心是相當良好的。就是在收獲上講，效果也還不差的。</p>
<p>其次，在導演的處理整部戲的環節上，我們看到了費穆先生的苦心——處處給人以「思索」的餘地。無論在「陳蔡絕糧」後的解圍，和周遊列國時的頭尾銜接等等，都留着中間的一段「過程」，給觀衆去「捉摸」，「搜尋」。但這裏有一點是値得注意的，就是一般水準較低的和不熟悉歷史事實的觀衆，就難以理解了，因此在跑上普遍化，大衆化的道路上，這是値得商榷的，筆者想質之費先生，不知以爲如何？</p>
<h3>關於演員方面</h3>
<p>這裏祗能就主要的演員來說一下：筆者認爲最成功的演員是飾子路的張翼和飾陽貨的徐立，在個性的刻劃上，和對戲的把握上，都有着相當優良的成就。其次是顏回（司馬央才）孔子（唐槐秋）子貢（裴冲）的演技，一般地說，都還在水準以上的。不過有一點倒値得指出的，就是在這張片子裹，有許多演員都是新生的力量，這不能不說是民華公司正確的方針，因爲這裏一方面可以造成提拔新人的運動，而打破造成少數「明星」的拙劣手段，一方面在「孤島」缺乏演戲人才的目前，的確是種良好的傾向，盼望這點也能影響其他的電影公司，而簪「孤島」電影界裏提拔出更優秀的新人才出來！</p>
<p>筆者很欣幸地看到了這巨片的問世，同時還盼朢民華當局能本着這一意旨更正確地往前發展。這是我們每個觀衆的期望，也是貢獻給讀者的一點忠實意見，並此介紹這張片子於讀者之前！</p>
<h3>小鳳</h3>
<p>— 翁仲馬做一生　經</p>
<h3>談孔夫子</h3>
<p>— 蝶野</p>
<p>「孔夫子」影片上演於金　，予以俗冗，未克往，因使小兒克言往觀；克曾回來，我問：「你對於孔夫子」的感想是怎樣呢？「</p>
<p>『父親，我不懂他們爲什麽要做「孔夫子？」』他說。</p>
<p>『那你感覺比埃洛茀林的羅賓漢怎麽樣？』</p>
<p>『那不能比，羅賓漢只是一個强盜罷了！』他說，</p>
<p>『比一代皇后如何？』</p>
<p>『那更不能比，她只是一個歌妓罷了！』</p>
<p>『比安迪生如何？』</p>
<p>『比……不得，孔夫子是反對伎巧來擾亂世界的人。』他想了一會纔說。</p>
<p>『比耶穌降生如何？』</p>
<p>『比得，……也比不得，好像這張片子耍比耶穌降生更深奧。』他懷疑似的說。</p>
<p>『對了。我們電影界要做「孔夫子」的偉大，意義就在這裏。第一：在孔夫子時候，像羅賓漢一類的盜賊，是指不勝屈，「文以弄法」是少正卯一類人；「俠以武犯禁，」是陽虎盜跖一類人；不有「祝駝之佞而有子都之後，」是南子一類人。在歐美影片裏，都予以有力的渲染，像安迪生可算一代的科學家了，沒有安迪生，我們至今夜裏還是黑暗着；他給予我們官能的享受，進步的物質文明，但孔夫子的發展，對於人類的貢獻，則在另一方面；在春秋之世的社會，某些地方正和現在的社會，差異不了多少，孟子說：「爭地以戰，殺人盈野，爭城以戰，殺人盈城。」孔夫于出而作正義的吶喊。中流砥柱，挽在瀾於旣倒，其功實萬世不能泯沒。在春秋殺人越貨的時代，只一個孔夫子是「廢戰」，他不語怪力亂紳。孔夫子雖有三千弟子，七十二個門徒，他也不過像耶穌一樣的，辛苦了一世，沒有做成功一件事。可是他偉大的精神，「仁義禮智信」五常的學說，却已籠罩了天地一切；後代聽明的帝皇就把他來替代了槍砲，使人民完全沉浸到這「仁義體智信」的皮壳裏去，而讓他一個人來做專制的魔王；大家不許背叛禮敎，而獨讓他一個人來做一切淫殺侵略的主宰。於是孔夫子從死到現在，他的名譽就寃寃枉枉的沉沒了二千年。現在你們所曉得的，只是大成至聖先師殿上泥班木雕的孔夫子，而沒有看見眞眞的有靈魂的有眞義的孔夫子，也就和西方人利用耶穌一樣，耶穌救我，耶穌何嘗能够輕輕就這樣輕恕了人們一切的罪惡呢？」</p>
<p>克言恍然的……『呵！我們要表演「孔夫子」，原來是這個道理。」</p>
<h3>宋雅海妮的勁敵</h3>
<p>— 鏞</p>
<p>宋雅海妮與愛娜安德姍（Erna　Andersen），一個是我們都熟悉的，已在好萊塢的銀壇上雄據了數年「溜冰皇后」的寳座，另一個尙生疏，她是最近才抵達美國而預備跟宋雅一決雌雄。二人同　挪威　，曾在同一先生下學習溜冰的技術，所以是舊日的同學。追究往括，還有値得提出的，在故鄕的時候，四次溜冰比賽中，每次總是宋雅壓倒愛娜而獲得冠軍，不過愛娜亦極受她先生的器重。愛娜自己這樣承　：「宋雅練習比我勤，無論雨天或雪天，她依舊在戶外練習不　，我却在戶內休息。」這或者就是愛娜每次失敗的緣故吧！</p>
<p>愛娜安德姍於未啟程至新大　前，一度偕其自己組織的劇團週游歐洲各國，備受歡迎，抵美後，曾參加紐約的國際冰舞會演出，聲名頓時溢揚。本人除長於溜冰外，兼長滑雪</p>
<p>愛娜雄心勃勃，一面希望能跟宋雅在美國影圈內競爭，而不再蹈往昔的舊轍，一面尙欲以其滑雪的新玩　介紹與銀幕人士，這二點她預定本年冬季可以實現。</p>
<h3>自好萊塢來</h3>
<p>— 寶嶙</p>
<p>由於美國的愛國主義蓬蓬勃勃地發揚起來，好萊塢的電影界也傾向於攝製大量的愛國片，描寫關於海軍陸軍和空軍等。最近宜佈的一部片子是「從西部來的十個人」，由泰羅飽華領銜主演的。</p>
<p>有一件事可以證明好萊場電影界是在向拉丁美洲開拓市塲了，那便是：米高梅公司決定以墨西哥歷史上著名英雄柴柏達事蹟開拍爲電影了。片名「柴柏達萬歲」，由大明星勞勃泰勒主演，至於該書的原作人卽係寫「自由萬歲」者。（按：「自由萬歲」係華雷斯皮萊成名作。）</p>
<p>大衛尼文在英國皇家空軍中服務，據自英格蘭傳來的消自說，他已與同隊中一個軍官的女兒結婚了。大衛尼文有好幾次險被轟炸所害。</p>
<p>蓓蒂黛維絲在紐約的一家咖啡館中曾與其已經離婚的前夫哈門納爾遜握手言歡。所以謠言又說他們兩人能立可可以破鏡重圓。</p>

<p>Venerable Master Taixu, Chairman of the Chinese Buddhist Association in Chongqing, recently wrote an article to welcome the Burmese journalist delegation, in which he mentioned the bombing of Buddhist temples in the accompanying capital by Japanese aircraft. He stated briefly: "Gentlemen, you grew up in Burma, where Buddhism is believed in. Last year, when the Chinese Buddhist delegation visited your country, it was well received by the local newspapers. After the Chinese Buddhist delegation returned to China, the recent situation of Buddhism in the accompanying capital should be told to you. In May and June, when our Buddhist delegation returned to the accompanying capital, it was during the height of Japanese aircraft bombing. The Chang'an Temple, where the Chinese Buddhist Association is located, is a magnificent and solemn Buddhist temple that has stood for hundreds of years. Now, it and the nearby Luohan Temple have both been reduced to rubble. What will your feelings be when you visit the site of the Chinese Buddhist Association's headquarters, Chang'an Temple, which was bombed four times and completely destroyed? However, while Japanese aircraft were bombing the accompanying capital, our Buddhist disciples, with the spirit of sacrificing themselves to save the world, formed a rescue team and stood tall on Lion Mountain on the south bank. They rescued the wounded and helped the dying under the bombing of Japanese aircraft from the north and south, earning the reputation of being the bravest in the accompanying capital."

<h3>Food Supply in Southern Guangxi Not Expected to Be Lacking</h3>
<p>Nanning: A reporter recently interviewed someone from the Guangxi Food Administration Department to inquire about the food supply and demand situation after the recovery of lost territory in southern Guangxi. According to him, this province experienced a drought this autumn, but the areas along the river suffered very little damage, and the harvest was quite good. Therefore, the food supply and demand in the recovered areas will not be a problem in the short term. At the beginning of the recapture of Nanning, food prices were very low. Now, as the people gradually return, the price of rice has also risen to about 21 yuan. However, in Mingjiang and Pingxiang, it is only sold for 17 or 18 yuan. However, in order to prevent a rice shortage during the lean spring season, the Food Administration Department and the provincial government have both formulated plans and ordered all counties in southern Guangxi to actively store grain in preparation for emergencies.

<h3>Thai Prime Minister Says British-Thai Relations Are Excellent; Believes Britain Sympathizes with Its Territorial Demands; Thai and Vietnamese Troops Exchange Artillery Fire</h3>
<p>Bangkok: Thai Prime Minister Phibunsongkhram, in a one-hour talk with a Reuters correspondent last night, expressed gratitude for British friendship and attention to Japan's so-called New Order. He also indicated Thailand's willingness to negotiate with France regarding the Vietnamese border dispute, stating that British-Thai relations are indeed excellent, as evidenced by the rapid and peaceful resolution of the recent Thai-Burmese border issue. He believes that Britain will sympathize with Thailand's demands on Vietnam and that Thailand is prepared to shake hands with France tomorrow and forget the animosity of the past 75 years, as long as the sparsely populated areas on the Thai side of the Mekong River are returned to Thailand so that Thailand can have a natural border. He also said that when the war was about to break out, France had intended to conclude a military agreement with Thailand, but Thailand declined because it wanted to maintain its neutrality. As for Japan's so-called New Order, Thailand will carefully study it because it has trade and other relations with Japan, but Thailand's greatest concern is to maintain its independent existence. (Reuters dispatch of the 16th)</p>
<p>Bangkok: According to the Thai Gazette, Thai and Vietnamese troops clashed again yesterday, exchanging artillery fire. Vietnamese troops concentrated, but were dispersed by Thai artillery. Thai troops also sank two small boats dispatched by Vietnamese troops. (Reuters dispatch of the 26th)</p>
<p>Bangkok: Thai Prime Minister Phibunsongkhram told foreign reporters on Tuesday that he believes Britain sympathizes with Thailand's territorial demands. He also believes that the new Thai-Japanese agreement is based on friendly mutual assistance and respect for territorial sovereignty, and is therefore no different from a non-aggression pact. He also said that Thailand is now studying Japan's proposed "New Order" in the Far East, and that Thailand has decided to take retaliatory measures against the French army's offensive. The Prime Minister also said that the French were the instigators of the Thai-Vietnamese war, as the French launched the attack first, disregarding the Thai people's gesture of peace. Songkhram also said that he himself is a peace-loving person and is always prepared to resolve the dispute with Vietnam, but Thailand's future actions will depend on the behavior of the French. He said that British-Thai relations have become smoother due to the adjustment of the Burmese border. Prime Minister Songkhram met with reporters at the Rose Palace. Songkhram's physique is quite healthy, and the Prime Minister knows a little English. The Prime Minister said, "Since we launched peace on the French side on December 14, the French side has not received any response other than intensifying the air raids. This is what we deeply regret." When asked if British support for Thailand's territorial demands was true, he replied, "We believe we have gained the sympathy of the British."

<p>New York: According to a report received by NBC last night from British Wireless, two French gunboats were sunk by Thai artillery off the coast of Thailand. (International News Service dispatch of the 26th)</p>
<p>French-Thai Relations Difficult to Improve</p>
<p>Bangkok: In a recent conversation with foreign reporters, Thai Prime Minister Songkhram, when asked by reporters if the arrival of a Saiburi delegation in Bangkok would mean that the door to a peaceful solution had been closed, replied, "I dare say that the relationship between our country and France is very far from peace, because first, France does not agree to the construction of border adjustments; second, the bombing and artillery fire on the border are initiated by France; third, France ignores even the proposals made by the former French ambassador to Thailand in preparation for a peaceful solution. In the past few decades, the French have ruled Vietnam with cruel means, and since the French defeat, their cruel methods have become even more intense. Our compatriots in Vietnam can no longer tolerate it, and thus revolutions have sprung up everywhere. At present, 10,000 Vietnamese people have crossed the border, including 200 Annamese soldiers, carrying heavy artillery and machine guns, to join our side, hoping to maintain their freedom and security. If the French continue to abuse our people in Vietnam, even if the Mekong River border is adjusted, our heart of resistance to France will not cease. The anti-French revolution in Vietnam has already formed a permanent phenomenon, which is nothing but the result of French oppression." (United Press dispatch of the 26th)</p>
<p>Bangkok: Local officials recently stated that French and Thai troops have continued to exchange artillery fire on the border, disregarding the spirit that should be maintained during the Christmas holiday. The French army, which attacked Thais, fired eight shells at Lakon Fanlong on Christmas Eve, and Thai artillery retaliated with eleven shells. Near Aranyaprathet and Ubon Ratchathani (both translated phonetically), the result of the machine gun fire between the two sides caused one woman to lose her life and two men to be injured in Ubon Ratchathani. Clashes also occurred near Klong Malik and Lakon Fanlong (both translated phonetically) on Monday and Tuesday. (United Press dispatch of the 26th)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Rumors Concerning the Chinese Communist Party</h3>
<p>In the free and open land of China, how does the Chinese Communist Party, in its spirit of unity, under the rule of the government, interact with other parties? How does it contribute to the war effort? There is relatively little news of this kind in Shanghai. On the contrary, there are more unfounded rumors. Especially since Shanghai newspapers have previously published fragmentary accounts, stating that the Chinese military authorities ordered the New Fourth Army to be transferred to the provinces of Hebei, Chahar, northern Shandong, and northern Shanxi. Then, all sorts of claims seemed to ferment like yeast: 1. Because the newspapers had not published such accounts for a long time, those who heard them felt they were novel, and those who spoke of them took them as material for conversation. 2. Because most of the officers of the New Fourth Army were members of the Communist Party, people instinctively felt a political consciousness and were affected by the innate human interest in politics. 3. Because in the guerrilla war zones near Shanghai, many active and disciplined guerrilla units kept their designations secret as a matter of military principle, but the New Fourth Army gradually became an open secret. Therefore, in this area, the general public assumed that all formal guerrilla units, regardless of their actual designation, were the New Fourth Army. In contrast to the gangs of bandits who harassed the villages, the general public cherished and protected the formal guerrilla units, and was therefore unusually concerned about any news and rumors involving the New Fourth Army. 4. The fourth reason always goes to extremes, especially since the first three reasons provided opportunities to exploit. This is also what is called "expanding official announcements." In the past two or three days, there have been widespread rumors about how the Nationalists and Communists are clashing in the central government and how they are conflicting in the local areas. The propaganda has been effective, causing those who hear it to worry and doubt.</p>
<p>The worst things to do when dealing with rumors are to be biased and to follow blindly. With bias, one either dismisses them as inaccurate or is happy to believe them easily. The result may be completely contrary to the facts. If one follows blindly, one unintentionally becomes the target of those who spread rumors. If one passes them on from one to ten, and from ten to a hundred, passing on errors from mouth to mouth, then one unintentionally becomes a tool of those who spread rumors. Even if one blindly follows but only keeps it to oneself, since the facts are fabricated, wouldn't the joy, anger, sorrow, and happiness in one's heart be too unjust? To reject bias, vigorously guard against blind following, and yet be unable to give up the rumors one has heard, the best thing to do is to diligently seek evidence. Based on the information obtained through diligent inquiry, one can either clearly prove that the rumors are solid or disprove that the rumors are unfounded. If the information is insufficient, then use common sense to judge. Reporters and readers are both in Shanghai, and there is no way to obtain enough information to make a clear proof or disproof of the various things concerning the CCP in the free and open land. Even the rumored transfer of the New Fourth Army is quite credible, but it is still appropriate to solemnly place it among the rumors. In dealing with such rumors, it is not difficult to use constant feelings and principles to decide whether to believe them or not.</p>
<p>First, political power must be based on the people. The people's obedience, following, and support of a political system do not depend on the length of all the theories in this system, the greatness of the authority, or the number of party members, but on the credibility that this system demonstrates and the trust that the people have in it. The thickness and multitude of trust are in a certain direct proportion to the size and strength of the power. This is a constant feeling and principle, and it is also an absolutely identical political iron law throughout ancient and modern times, in China and abroad. Facts must receive the final and most fair judgment from this iron law. The Chinese Communist Party solemnly declares that it accepts the Three Principles of the People as the founding principles and is loyal to the national policy of resisting Japan and building the country. This has already become the broadest and most shallow creed of all actions and attitudes of the Chinese Communist Party. With the CCP's aspirations, it is certainly not necessary to wait for the urging or pressure from outside the party, but it will automatically abide by the creed and will not want to lose faith with the public, hoping to gain more people's following and support. Therefore, no matter from what point or angle one observes the Chinese Communist Party, all rumors concerning the CCP's abandonment of the Three Principles of the People and hindering the national policy of resisting Japan and building the country can be asserted to be inaccurate. Friction between people is mainly because the party and the party have not been able to maintain complete harmony at all times and in all things. This is within the realm of constant feelings and principles. However, as far as the Nationalists and Communists are concerned, there is also a maximum limit. That is, any friction and disharmony will not exceed the boundaries of accepting the Three Principles of the People and completing the national policy of resisting Japan and building the country. This is not a bias in favor of doctrines and policies, but the standard by which the people show their love, hate, closeness, and distance to the Communist Party, and it is also a judgment that can be used to predict the political future of the Communist Party in China. To take a step back, at least this is inevitable during the period of resistance against Japan and building the country.</p>
<p>Second, "regarding the New Fourth Army issue." Troop transfers are common in military affairs. Military orders, of course, do not come with reasons. In a country in peacetime, especially in wartime, military orders must be unified and must be implemented. Therefore, assuming that the rumors of the transfer are true, the question is definitely not whether there is a reason or not. Nor is it whether the New Fourth Army is willing or unwilling to obey the transfer order. Not only is the question not here, but the transfer should be regarded as normal and it should be asserted that it should not become a question at all. If it is said that this involves politics and is therefore not simple, then in fact, it is a great misconception to regard this as involving politics. This is because the army is led by officers, but does not belong to the officers who lead it. Officers have their beliefs and their party affiliation, but the army does not belong to the party because of the officer's party affiliation. In short, it is the army of the country. In peacetime, especially in wartime, the army must not be divided into so-called spheres of influence, and there must be no so-called obedience or disobedience. Only then can it fight, and only then can it win. If it is divided into spheres of influence, it becomes a distinction between friend and enemy. If there is obedience or disobedience, there is a distinction between compliance and defiance. Therefore, the New Fourth Army, which is ordered to transfer, may be reluctant to leave its original defense area because of the time and feelings that have accumulated, but it will definitely not act in defiance and disobey orders. Those who claim to resist orders and refuse to leave must be a group with ulterior motives. They are not the army of the country, not a formal guerrilla unit, and not the true New Fourth Army. If there are any problems, it is not easy to conduct large-scale marches publicly, leaving only the technical problems of the transfer and the time issue. Taking a step back, if military orders and military actions do contain some political implications, then not only should one not believe the rumors of resistance to the transfer based on common sense; on the contrary, imagine that the New Fourth Army is absolutely willing to transfer to Hebei, Chahar, northern Shandong, and northern Shanxi for political reasons, so that it can gradually concentrate and strengthen forces with the Eighteenth Group Army in that area. Judging from constant feelings and principles, no army is willing to be scattered and thin, that is, there is no reason to believe the rumors.</p>
<p>Third, regarding the rumored conflicts in certain places, not only are the names of the generals, the designations of the troops, and the locations mentioned in the rumors "mismatched," and one knows immediately that they are impossible and unbelievable; but also in terms of the greater principle and the overall situation, within a narrow area, in fact and in terms of interests, only two armies are allowed to stand against each other, and a three-way stand is not allowed. Even if there is a momentary stand, it must immediately become a friendly or hostile party due to the relationship of interests, grievances, and closeness. From this point of view, would an army led by a truly Communist general collude with the Japanese army? Would an army led by a Kuomintang general collude with the Japanese army? It is absolutely impossible to abandon friends to help enemies and turn against each other. If there is such a thing, it is a mobile element between the positions of the Chinese and Japanese armies, and what does it have to do with the Chinese Communist Party?</p>
<p>The above three kinds of unbelievable rumors have the four reasons mentioned earlier that help spread the rumors. In addition, there is one more point that may increase the attention of various parties inside and outside the country to the rumors: that is, the Soviet Union gives sympathy and assistance to China's war of resistance. Then, assuming that there is a problem of mutual hostility between the Nationalists and Communists, wouldn't this affect Sino-Soviet relations, and even affect the future of the war of resistance? This is a question that China and China's friends should be concerned about. And those who are most excited are those who expect Sino-Soviet relations to deteriorate. They believe that by undermining Sino-Soviet relations, they can seize the favor of the Soviet Union. The gains and losses in this should be discussed separately. In China, the sole goal is to strive for independence and freedom and maintain the integrity of sovereignty and territory. All internal measures, whether military, political, or economic, and all external choices, whether friendly, friendly, estranged, or hostile, are based on this goal as the sole standard. That is, even the issues related to the above-mentioned rumors must be considered and decided based on this standard. In the Soviet Union, it must also decide everything based on the current and near-future interests of its entire country. That is, its compromise with Germany and its assistance to China are two completely different aspects, but it can be believed that the basic reasons are completely consistent. As for Sino-Soviet relations and the coexistence of the Nationalists and Communists in China, these are two circles with different centers. Although the two centers are quite close, they will never merge into one. Therefore, both China and the Soviet Union will inevitably take the coexistence of the Nationalists and Communists in China as an object for serious consideration, but it is not a factor that determines everything. Therefore, even if the Nationalists and Communists are hostile to each other, one cannot draw the conclusion that Sino-Soviet relations will deteriorate and be detrimental to the war of resistance, let alone draw the conclusion that there will be friendship between the Soviets and Japan. Moreover, the rumors are inaccurate!</p>
<h3>The Ministry of Communications Strengthens Water and Land Combined Transportation Work in Sichuan, Hunan, and Shaanxi; Plans to Establish a Training Class for Post and Transport Personnel; Those Transporting Grain are Exempt from Military Service</h3>

<h3>Shaoguan to Shark Bay Highway Suffers Repeated Bombings</h3>
<p>Hong Kong – Travelers injured on the highway from Shaoguan to Shark Bay due to repeated air raids have arrived here and recounted their experiences. It is said that the section from Xixiang Village (transliteration) to Huizhou was bombed by Japanese aircraft for a week, making this section of the journey the most difficult. Xixiang Village is not far from Hong Kong and is the first stop from Shark Bay. The small village was bombed for five consecutive days and is almost completely in ruins. The third stop, Guichuan (transliteration), was also heavily bombed, and the same happened to Danshui and Huizhou. Freight stations, oil depots, and garages were all targets of Japanese aircraft. According to travelers, most pedestrians were killed or injured by aircraft strafing. Japanese aircraft flew low, only about thirty feet above the ground. More than thirty corpses have been sent back here for burial. If it were not for the difficulty of medical treatment on the road, some of them could still have been saved. The goods on the highway were all destroyed by incendiary bombs. Because the bombs were dropped from low altitude, they were very easy to hit the target. There is now a large amount of goods piled up on the highway, and the goods piled up in Shark Bay are in a mess. Because the customs must wait until after 5 p.m. to remove the goods, the customs do not perform their duties during the day for fear of air raids. Japanese aircraft focused on bombing the coolies and pedestrians between Shark Bay and Danshui, and also paid attention to all sailboats and gasoline boats directly connected to the Dongjiang River source. From here, travelers must abandon their boats and go ashore, taking the highway to Shaoguan. It is generally believed that these air raids will continue to occur. In the past ten days, fifty people have been killed and seventy injured in air raids, with goods losses reaching one million yuan in national currency. (23rd International News Agency dispatch)</p>
<h3>Du Yuesheng's Broadcast Speech to Shanghai Residents</h3>
<p>Chongqing – Last night, Du Yuesheng issued a special broadcast here to Shanghai residents, warning Chinese in the occupied areas not to use banknotes issued by the "Nanjing Central Bank" to avoid trouble for themselves. He said that the banknotes issued by the banks under the control of the Japanese military have now reached 200 billion yuan and have no sufficient guarantee. The Japanese hope to use these banknotes to obtain legal tender in order to purchase foreign exchange or buy Chinese goods. When the Japanese army is driven out in the future, these banknotes will become waste paper and have no value. The total amount of banknotes issued by the Chongqing Central Government, as of now, has only reached 390 billion yuan. In addition to ordinary guarantees, the United States has recently lent China 100 million US dollars, and the United Kingdom has lent 100 million pounds sterling to stabilize the legal tender. The Soviet Union has also lent a large sum of money. The Central Government does not recognize unapproved currency. He hopes that Shanghai residents will pay attention and not use it.

In reality, he is stabbing Christ with a blade stabbing Greece, because anyone who violates Christ's laws of peace is tantamount to stabbing Christ. (26th Reuters dispatch)</p>

<h3>British and Italian Forces Exchange Artillery Fire Around Bardia; Italians Bomb British Forces to Reduce Pressure; British Also Bomb Italian Airfields and Ports</h3>

<h3>Soviet Union Feels Threatened by Germany and Japan; Actively Expands Red Army Fleet; Main Force Stays in the Pacific to Guard Against Possible Invasion; Powerful Submarine Force Built, Largest in the World</h3>
<p>Washington – According to unofficial information obtained by the US Navy Department, the Soviet Union has built the most powerful submarine force in the world, totaling no less than 171 ships. According to this figure, the Soviet submarine force is 50 ships larger than Germany's, which has 120 submarines and is the second largest submarine force in the world. The exact number of submarines the Soviet Union is currently building is unknown, but according to recent reports, the number is very large. The Soviet Union has repeatedly published official gazettes expressing its intention to greatly expand the Red Army fleet. However, in other respects, the Soviet Navy is only second-rate in the world. However, it has no fewer than six strategic coastal locations, and its neighbors are powerful and aggressive naval powers. According to credible information in the reports received, the Soviet Union currently has three old battleships, all built in 1911, which are of little use in combat. These battleships are slow, lightly armed, and have limited range. In addition, the Soviet Union has nine cruisers, one aircraft carrier, and sixty-seven destroyers, with several more ships under construction. In terms of tonnage, the Red Army's maritime strength is not less than that of other countries. Due to its vast territory, the Soviet Union's naval strength is inevitably dispersed. The main force of the Red Army fleet must remain in the Pacific to defend against the Japanese Navy to the extent possible. Japan's Navy is the third largest in the world and claims to have ten battleships, with another eight under construction. Japan has five times more destroyers than the Soviet Union. Japan also has seven aircraft carriers, while the Soviet Union only has one. In addition to keeping a large part of its fleet in the Pacific, the Soviet Union must also keep a small number in the Black Sea. After Germany gained a base in the area, it is expected that the Soviet Union will increase its strength in that area. Since Romania fell into the Axis group, Greece has continuously sent small submarines to Romania. The new German base in the Black Sea has invisibly posed a minor threat to the Soviet Union. In addition, the Red Army fleet must also keep a small number in the Baltic Sea. Since annexing Estonia, Lithuania, and Latvia, the Soviet Union has gained a long-range naval frontier in the area. The Soviet Union in the Baltic Sea, like in the Black Sea, is ideally opposed by a small but modern navy. Although Germany has suffered many losses due to the European war, Germany's Navy is superior to the Soviet Union's in both quantity and quality. Germany has six battleships, all relatively new, and two more are under construction. For this reason, the Soviet Union's need for a large navy is no less than that of Britain and Japan. The overseas supply and maintenance of raw materials in Britain and Japan depend on the power of the Navy. However, Moscow has realized this, and officials have repeatedly declared that the country's fleet should be greatly expanded. (6th United Press dispatch)</p>
<h3>Christmas Sky Truce; Hitler Makes a Surprise Tour; Berlin Officials Emphasize Implication; Will Launch a More Intense Attack on England Again</h3>
<p>Berlin – According to today's disclosure, German leader Hitler took advantage of the three-day Christmas truce in Western European airspace to take a Christmas tour to "somewhere in the west" aboard a German naval patrol boat.

(26th International News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>Berlin – Officials here yesterday hinted in strong tones that after the current "Christmas truce," Germany will immediately inflict a more powerful blow on England than before.

Regarding the proposal to England for a sky truce, Germany notified Washington that if the British Air Force does not attack Germany and its occupied areas, German aircraft will not bomb England. So far, neither side has broken this tacit truce agreement. However, German officials said that if the British side attacks Germany, Germany will immediately retaliate. (26th International News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>Berlin – A German command headquarters communiqué stated that the German Air Force had not attacked the enemy from December 24, including that night and the 25th.

<p>London – Although there was no definitive agreement on a suspension of aerial warfare during Christmas, the Royal Air Force did not fly to Germany that day, and the activity of German aircraft over Britain was limited to a few German aircraft appearing in the skies over the Orkney Islands and off the coast of Scotland. Whether this quiet on the second Christmas of the war was due to the weather is not yet known. British bombers were dispatched on Christmas Eve, and London did not issue an alert. However, one German aircraft was shot down by a British fighter plane in the Orkney Islands, and the four crew members were captured. (26th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>London – Yesterday was Christmas, and Christ bestowed peace upon the British and German peoples. The British and German nations respected Christ and ceased fire with each other.

No German aircraft were seen on Tuesday evening and all day on Sunday. German artillery on the continental coast of the English Channel remained silent, and the British artillery batteries in the Dover area along the coast also remained silent. Germany, through neutral diplomatic channels, had hinted that if the British did not send aircraft to bomb on Christmas, Germany would also avoid aerial warfare. Although British officials refused to admit that the British government had signed any truce agreement with the Germans, British bombers did not fly to Germany and German-occupied areas of the Continent to carry out their usual air raids.

<h3>French Law Does Not Allow Martinique to Be Used by the American Navy; Ambassador Leahy to Consult with Pétain; Vichy Deeply Fears Provoking German Displeasure</h3>
<p>Washington, Yesterday's reliable sources say, American naval leaders believe that Martinique Island is sufficient to become an important unit of liaison bases, for the currently planned construction to defend the southern entrance and exit of the Caribbean Sea. American naval leaders are very willing to use the island as a naval and air base. Recently, the French government has refused to approve the use of the island. Experts say that the use of the island will cause the entire Caribbean Sea to be closed. Informal talks on mainland leases or other rights have been held one after another. German and French officials politely refused. Therefore, it is widely believed that when former Naval Operations Director Admiral Leahy arrives in Vichy to take office as the American ambassador, he will discuss this matter with Marshal Pétain. Officials said that the French attitude towards this matter is influenced by the fear of German retaliation, because Germany may regard the granting of base rights as an anti-Nazi move. The US Navy Department believes that France Port in Martinique Island is one of the good ports in the Lesser Antilles. (United Press dispatch on the 26th)</p>

<p>Special Article</p>
<h3>American Ambassador to Japan, Grew</h3>
<p>Ambassador Grew, in terms of belief and experience, is a businessman. He despises titles bought with money, just as writers despise books bought with money. When some people who claim to be diplomats talk to him, Grew always evades the topic and tells them, "I know what nitrate is." He walks hesitantly and speaks stutteringly. Finally, when he is forced to, he says, "Yes, I know they are lower than the current valuation."</p>
<p>When Grew was young, he suffered from scarlet fever, which caused him to lose his hearing in his left ear. When she first entered the diplomatic world, Harvard University Professor Coolidge gave her the nickname of "deaf diplomat." Grew was disappointed and almost committed suicide. But he came back to know how to make good use of his shortcomings. He has never worn a hearing aid. He knows that not hearing shallow and ignorant remarks is also good for him, or it is better to pretend not to hear them. For example, if angry words have to be repeatedly explained to the deaf, wouldn't it be too ridiculous. He also felt the humorous side of this matter. From 1922 to 1923, he represented the United States in the Lausanne Conference convened for the Near East issue. Turkish Foreign Minister Ismet was also deaf. Grew often sat in a corner with him, talking loudly in French, exchanging their opinions.</p>
<p>No one really knows how deaf Ambassador Grew is. A few years ago, when Quezon, the elected President of the Philippines, traveled to Japan, the Japanese Imperial Family held an informal banquet to entertain Quezon. During the banquet, the seats were arranged with Quezon sitting on the right of the Japanese Emperor and Grew sitting on the left of the Japanese Emperor. Before everyone was seated, Grew's attendant pointed out the error in this seating arrangement. The food officer immediately explained to him that this seating arrangement would make it easier for the Emperor's words to enter Grew's ear that was not deaf. Grew, upon hearing this, said, "Don't talk nonsense! I can hear everything the Emperor says to me, no matter what language."</p>
<p>Mrs. Grew doesn't like this tiger skin glaring at her for a reason. She was born into a prestigious Boston family, gentle in nature and elegant in manners. She does not like the expression of rude emotions, whether it is a person or a tiger. Like her, being calm, tolerant, gentle, and amiable can be considered a perfect diplomatic wife. The story of Grew and her marriage is also a beautiful story in his life.</p>
<p>Not long after he returned to Boston via Spain, at a banquet, he asked someone to introduce him to Miss Lin Deland, who had just returned from Japan. Unexpectedly, due to some strange circumstances, he was mistakenly introduced to Miss Alice Perry. This Miss Alice had not only lived in Japan but was also the great-niece of the intrepid old Perry, who was the first to open up Japan. Grew fell in love at first sight and began to pursue her.</p>
<p>He felt that his work in Cairo was not only limited in income (military pay was only 600 yuan) but also very boring, so he was determined to pursue Alice. Finally, he proposed to her in a telegram and was accepted. He hurried back to Boston. A few hours before the wedding on October 7, 1905, Alice's father, with a stern face, led Grew to the dining room, pushed open a window, and said to him, "This is your last chance to escape. I will never tell anyone." Grew was bold enough to remain calm even four days away from a fierce tiger, so of course, small matters were not worth mentioning.</p>
<p>Grew's career in the diplomatic world has been smooth sailing. He was promoted from Cairo to Third Secretary of the Mexican Legation, then transferred to the Russian Embassy as Third Secretary, the German Embassy as Second Secretary, and the Austrian Legation as Secretary. When the clouds of war loomed in 1914, he was transferred back to Berlin. When the last European War broke out, he served as the Counselor of Ambassador Gerard. During the three most tense months of Germany's unrestricted submarine warfare, he served as Chargé d'Affaires. He was one of the last Americans to leave Berlin and Vienna.</p>
<p>When the last European War was about to end, he served as the Director of the Western European Division of the State Department in Washington. Soon after, he was dispatched to Europe with President Wilson's special envoy, Colonel House, to participate in the armistice negotiations. This departure was extremely secretive. His beloved wife and children were vacationing in Hancock and had no idea of his plan. It was not until he arrived on the other side of the Atlantic that they learned about it. After the armistice treaty was signed, he jumped to the rank of Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary, serving as the Secretary of the American Delegation to the Peace Conference.</p>

<h3>Japan Excludes the Rights and Interests of Various Countries; Seeks to Monopolize Trade in China; North China and the Yangtze River Are Almost Entirely Controlled; Intensified Efforts Are Also Being Made in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Regarding Japan's exclusion of the interests of third countries in China, it has recently become even more intensified. In Central China, Japan has organized a number of monopolistic companies to monopolize import and export trade. In North China, it uses the "United Reserve Bank" to implement control over exchange and trade.</p>
<p>Trade Statistics Use Smoke Screens</p>
<p>According to sources in the Shanghai business community, foreign trade in North China has been monopolized by Japan. Because the Japanese use smoke screens in trade statistics, the detailed situation is not yet known to all sectors. According to reporters' inquiries with relevant parties, for goods from countries outside the Japanese yen bloc entering North China, when compiling statistics, the customs under Japanese management convert the prices of various imported goods (landed prices, calculated in foreign currency) into national currency according to the black market exchange rate, and then convert them into gold units according to the ratio of national currency to gold units, which is different from the recording method adopted by the Shanghai Customs.</p>
<p>British and American Commerce Actually Declines</p>
<p>Therefore, if the import of American goods in Shanghai is 10,000 gold units, according to the calculation method of Tianjin, it is listed as 50,000 gold units. Therefore, on the surface, if statistics are used as a basis, British and American imported goods in North China have not decreased, but in reality, they have decreased significantly. However, this kind of obfuscation method by the Japanese can only cover up the ears and eyes of the general Chinese and foreign people, while the British and American businessmen and diplomats in China have already understood its content.</p>
<p>Yangtze River Basin Dominated by Japanese Merchants</p>
<p>Recently, the "North China United Reserve Bank" has become increasingly strict in controlling import and export trade and exchange. Imports must be licensed, and exports must be settled. British and American commercial firms have suffered severe blows. In Central China, the opening of the Yangtze River shipping has been repeatedly delayed, and the import and export trade in the Yangtze River basin is monopolized by Japanese merchants, and third countries have no room to intervene.</p>
<p>Shanghai Is Again Intensifying Control</p>
<p>Only the Shanghai area can foreign merchants still be free, but recently the Japanese father and son have intensified control. The "Jiangning Bank" will also open on schedule, so in the future, the Japanese will inevitably promote the method of excluding foreign merchants in North China to various parts of Central China, and the center of British and American economic interests in China is also in jeopardy.</p>
<h3>Italian Ship "Carini" with Cotton Detained</h3>
<p>The English-language Great American Evening News said that the Italian merchant river ship "Carini" (75 tons), carrying cotton worth 40,000 yuan, came to Shanghai and was detained by the Japanese naval authorities here this morning (26th) for allegedly carrying cotton out of the mainland to obtain Japanese "permission". It is found that the "Carini" is the seventh Axis ship detained by the Japanese naval authorities here in the past two months. The other six ships include four Italian ships and two German ships, all of which are now detained in front of the Japanese Navy "Water Police Station" near Shuizha in Nanshi. According to what was learned this morning, the "Carini" had just returned to Shanghai with cotton from various ports at the mouth of the Yangtze River and berthed on the Bund when Japanese sailors rushed to the "Carini" and ordered it to sail to the Japanese "police station". It is said that the cotton was obtained by a certain Chinese merchant in this city after obtaining the necessary bills of lading from the customs in advance.</p>
<h3>Unsettled Cases in the Second Special Court Are Being Discussed for Relief Measures; May Be Transferred to the First Special Court; Authorities of Courts at All Levels Are Negotiating</h3>
<p>Since the two courts in the French Concession withdrew last month, all unsettled cases have been temporarily suspended. According to what the reporter of Ping Ming News Agency learned from the judicial circle yesterday, the Branch of the Supreme Court of the Ministry of Justice and the Second Branch of the High Court are working hard to find relief measures for the cases that citizens appealed to the Third Branch of the High Court before November 8 that have not been concluded, and for those who are not satisfied with the judgment of the Second Special Court and intend to appeal again. Judges at all levels who withdrew from the Second Special Zone have recently had discussions with the Branch of the Supreme Court and the Second Branch of the High Court. Specific measures may be formulated soon to transfer the unsettled cases of the two courts in the French Concession to the Public Concession Court for continued handling.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong Entry Ban Request for Extension</h3>
<p>In order to prevent undesirable elements from entering Hong Kong, the British authorities in Hong Kong issued an ordinance restricting population entry into Hong Kong some time ago, which was originally scheduled to be implemented on the 18th of this month. Later, the Hong Kong Immigration Department postponed it to the 14th of next month. According to news from the shipping industry, the shipping companies in Hong Kong, Shanghai, and other places are busy with the past year and merchants travel frequently. The Hong Kong authorities requested another postponement, but whether it will be approved is still unknown.</p>
<h3>The Exchange Equalization Fund Responds to Black Market Foreign Exchange According to Established Policies; Legitimate Trade Can Be Settled at Legal Prices; British and American Banks Have Refused to Swap</h3>
<p>Shanghai's environment is special, such as customs revenue being intercepted, Japanese goods being imported into the occupied areas, black market foreign exchange speculation, and capital escaping from the mainland and concessions. The Chinese government cannot exercise its power in the concessions. Because it is not directly controlled by the government, it mostly engages in speculation in foreign exchange. If the government maintains the exchange rate as in the past, it will result in facilitating the importers of non-essential products and those who plunder legal tender from the occupied areas to obtain foreign exchange. Providing funds to importers of non-essential products is equivalent to helping capital escape, and facilitating those who obtain foreign exchange to make huge profits, which should not be done by the government. Now, the measures taken by the Management Committee of the Foreign Exchange Equalization Fund to maintain the black market foreign exchange in Shanghai are based on the established policies of the government.</p>
<p>Protect the Interests of Legitimate Merchants</p>
<p>It is necessary to restrict imported goods that are not necessary for resistance and construction, as well as goods manufactured in Japan. However, foreign trade is based on whether it is related to the needs of the life of the country and the nation. Therefore, legitimate Chinese and foreign merchants will be given various conveniences. Legitimate merchants only need to apply to the Foreign Exchange Payment Review Committee according to the foreign exchange application method, and they will be able to obtain foreign exchange at a price higher than the Shanghai black market. This is the method for the Chinese government to protect the interests of legitimate merchants and prevent them from suffering losses in the black market. The Chinese government still encourages the import of goods, but only limited to essential items.</p>
<p>Refuse Foreign Exchange Arbitrage Swaps</p>
<p>Although the Shanghai black market exchange rate has been maintained by the Management Committee of the Foreign Exchange Equalization Fund in cooperation with banks in friendly countries, it is actually to maintain the normal trade of various friendly countries in China. However, merchants in various friendly countries who need foreign exchange for legitimate trade must have supporting documents and purchase them from banks in various friendly countries. As for foreign exchange arbitrage and swaps, the foreign merchant banks association and the Chinese merchant banks association have long resolved to refuse them in unison, with the aim of preventing speculators from using their skills and stabilizing the black market foreign exchange for a long time. Now, British HSBC, McCallie, American Citibank and other banks, as well as various Chinese banks engaged in foreign exchange business, have complied.</p>
<h3>American Red Cross Medicines Distributed in the Mainland; Dr. Baker to Come to Shanghai Next Spring</h3>
<p>Dr. Baker, the director-general of the American Red Cross, after returning to Hong Kong freely from Kunming, flew to Guilin, Chongqing, and other places in the first ten days of the month to inspect the lives of the people in free China and plan the distribution of medicines for relief and other matters. After completing his official duties, he is scheduled to return to Hong Kong via Shao on the 30th of this month, spend the New Year in Hong Kong, and come to Shanghai in January next year.</p>
<p>The First Batch of Medicines to Arrive in China Next Spring</p>
<p>The first batch of medicines from the American Red Cross to relieve Chinese disaster victims, worth 350,000 yuan, has been transported to the Chinese mainland via the Yunnan-Burma Road after arriving in Yangon and handed over to Chinese relief agencies, Chinese hospitals, and American hospitals for use. A small amount of quinine is for relieving Shanghai refugees and has also been shipped to Shanghai by ship for distribution and relief. There is also a second batch of medicines that will be shipped to China in mid-January next year.</p>
<p>Wheat Transported to Occupied Areas for Relief</p>
<p>The 20,000 bags of rice and wheat shipped from the United States to Shanghai last month, in addition to the distribution of Shanghai has been completed, the rest of the relief to Changshu Su and other occupied areas, due to export procedures, has not yet been completed, has not yet been transported. Now that the export "rush certificate" and other documents have been completed, the Shanghai branch of the American Red Cross has scheduled to transport and distribute relief within days. The bulk of the relief to refugees in the occupied areas this time is wheat, while Shanghai is mostly rice.</p>
<h3>Unsold Goods Stored in Vietnam</h3>
<p>After the authorities in French Vietnam ordered the interruption of the Yunnan-Vietnam traffic, they prepared to auction off the goods stored in Vietnam. According to news from the post office, more than 30,000 postal parcels accumulated in Haiphong and Hanoi were successively transported out of the tombs and transferred to the mainland after the General Post Office negotiated with the Vietnamese authorities in the autumn of this year. Only a small number are still stored in Vietnam. As to whether they will be auctioned off, no report has been received yet.</p>
<h3>Yesterday's Rice Market Implemented New Price Limits; Detectives Monitored Transactions; Brokers Were Refused Entry to Prevent Future Problems; Secret Transactions Outside the Market Were Rampant and Deserved Attention</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Rice Price Committee issued an emergency public notice yesterday morning that the price limits for all fourteen types of foreign rice, as previously assessed, would be strictly enforced starting yesterday. Anyone found engaging in disobedience, exceeding price limits, or conducting private secret transactions would be severely punished as a warning to others. The fourteen price limits are as follows: Saigon No. 1, 87 yuan; Saigon No. 2, 81.5 yuan; Siam No. 2, 80 yuan; Best Fire Refined, 86 yuan; Small Refined, 79 yuan; Siam No. 1, 89 yuan; Saigon Annam Green Rice, 78 yuan; Saigon Mixed Broken No. 1 and 2, 76 yuan; High Tokyo Milled Rice, 79 yuan; Tokyo Brown Rice, 75 yuan. The above prices are calculated per dan (160 catties). Saigon No. 1, 104 yuan; Saigon No. 2, 98 yuan; Small Refined, 97 yuan; Saigon Mixed Broken No. 1 and 2, 91 yuan. The above prices are calculated per bag (i.e., Jardine Matheson original bag).</p>
<p>Detective Surveillance</p>
<p>In light of the past food crises, the concession authorities are deeply concerned about the current rice market inflation. To eliminate panic and prevent future problems, in addition to ordering rice merchants to purchase large quantities of foreign rice and transport it to Shanghai for regulation, and actively storing 200,000 bags of grain in public warehouses, they have also dispatched three or four detectives to the rice market yesterday to strictly monitor rice merchants' transactions in the market in order to crack down on illegal transactions in the rice market and to stop secret deals. Anyone found engaging in private secret transactions or exceeding price limits will be arrested and prosecuted according to law without leniency. On the first day yesterday, in addition to patrolling and monitoring transactions in the market, another person was assigned to the market registration to strictly check the market entry permits held by those entering the market.</p>
<p>Sale Registration</p>
<p>Shanghai Rice Evaluation Committee, Public Notice No. 12, "Emergency Public Notice: This committee resolved at a meeting on the 24th of this month that in order to stabilize the rice market, starting from the 26th of this month, strict restrictions should be imposed on those entering the rice market to buy and sell. Except for members of the bean and rice industry, the miscellaneous grain and oil cake industry, the rice shop industry, and the three public associations, anyone selling rice must first return to the market management committee for registration and approval before entering the market for sale. In addition to informing the market management committee to take note and handle this matter, this is hereby recorded and publicly announced for general information. Special announcement." According to the registration matters to be handled, the market management committee had previously handled this matter, and it is hoped that the committee can carry it out effectively.</p>
<p>Broker Actions</p>
<p>The Bean and Rice Broker Association, in order to persuade fellow traders to abide by the evaluation committee's resolution and temporarily suspend business in the market, convened an emergency meeting the day before yesterday and issued Public Notice No. 27 yesterday, which stated, "We have received a letter from the Rice Evaluation Committee informing us that all members should temporarily suspend entering the rice market for two weeks, etc." The association held a temporary emergency meeting yesterday and resolved to advise all members to temporarily suspend buying and selling from today. The association will strive to negotiate with the committee and will issue another notice once the matter is resolved. Ruan Zhaogen, Zhang Zhaoliang, Wang Chunfang, Pan Huifu, Chen Xiaodi, and Zhang Qiuting have been appointed to investigate the association's affairs. All members are expected to comply.</p>
<p>Yesterday's Market Was Quiet</p>
<p>After the rice shop tea party market opened as usual at 9:00 a.m. yesterday, general rice brokers still held samples of rice and grains entrusted to them for sale and attempted to enter the market to act as intermediaries, but were refused entry by the gate guards, causing them to be stranded outside the market. However, these people's nature was hard to change, and they secretly peddled outside the market, which was indeed illegal. Although the market was still crowded with people, there was a situation where there was a market but no goods. Those buying and selling according to the price limit were still rarely heard. This was because the buyers still thought the evaluated price was too high, and there was very little profit if sold at the door. Conversely, the sellers still thought the evaluated price was too low and deliberately hoarded goods and refused to release them easily at reduced prices. Secret transactions outside the market were more numerous than in the market, which restrained the rice price and made it impossible to lower it.</p>
<p>Tax Exemption Extension</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance issued a circular to customs offices in various places, stating, "The Ministry previously stipulated three measures for the tax-free import of foreign rice during the lean season of this year. The tax-free import of foreign rice was limited to the four months of May, June, July, and August, which has now expired. After investigation, it is found that the provinces of Fujian and Guangdong, as well as all areas near the war zones and the rear coastal areas, are in urgent need of rice and grain relief. In order to facilitate merchants' purchase and import of foreign rice to enrich the people's food supply, it is specially stipulated that the tax-free import of foreign rice shall be as follows: (1) The purchase and transportation of foreign rice shall be exempt from import duties from November 1, 1940, to the end of October 1941. (2) The tax-free imported foreign rice shall be sold at a fair price by the Finance Department. (3) All funds for purchasing foreign rice shall be provided by the rice merchants themselves in foreign exchange."</p>
<h3>The Bridges on the Suzhou Creek Were Once Blocked; It Was Said That Important Japanese Figures Were Passing Through; Special Precautions Were Taken to Prevent Accidents</h3>
<p>The bridges on the Suzhou Creek, such as the Garden Bridge, Sichuan Road Bridge, Jiangxi Road Bridge, and Henan Road Bridge, were all closed by the Japanese side from 2:00 a.m. yesterday, causing traffic north and south of the Suzhou Creek to come to a standstill. They were not opened until after 6:00 a.m. yesterday, for a total blockade of four hours. At that time, some vegetable and fish vendors who were rushing to the early market were blocked south of the bridge. It was rumored that important Japanese figures were passing through the northern district of the Suzhou Creek, and special precautions had to be taken to prevent accidents.</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese in Thailand Are a Force to Be Reckoned With; 4.5 Million People Are United; The Strength of Japanese Merchants Is Weak and Incomparable; The Sincere Words of the Head of the Japanese Sample Goods Team Visiting Thailand</h3>
<p>The English-language Great American Evening News reported that Miyata, the head of the Japanese sample goods exhibition team currently visiting Thailand, wrote to a Tokyo newspaper, stating that the strength of Japanese merchants in Thailand is weak and insufficient to seize the commerce maintained by Chinese merchants there. There are a total of 52 Japanese merchant firms in Thailand, including the Mitsui and Mitsubishi branch offices, and the total number of Japanese residents is less than 700. Daily necessities in Thailand are quite cheap, and most of the goods are shipped from China. All of these goods are labeled as coming from Shanghai and Hong Kong. It is said that Chinese merchants in Thailand unanimously refuse to sell goods labeled "Made in Japan." It is also said that after the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, Chinese merchants immediately boycotted all Japanese goods and even refused to talk to Japanese people, which is still the case today. There are currently 4.5 million overseas Chinese living in Thailand. They did not all come from their homeland in a large-scale colonization. Most of the Chinese merchants are descendants of Chinese who lived in Thailand one or two hundred years ago. All the villages and towns outside Bangkok are crowded with overseas Chinese. It can be said that there is no corner of Thailand without traces of overseas Chinese. The Japanese all live in Bangkok, so they cannot trade directly with the locals.</p>
<h3>Shen Daling Explains the Common Points of the Five Religions; Discusses How the Essential Meanings of Abstaining from Lust, Fighting, and Gain Agree</h3>
<p>At the seventh lecture of the Five Religions Integration Society, Mr. Shen Daling spoke on the Three Abstentions as Common to the Five Religions, saying, "In the Jishi chapter of the Analects, Confucius said, 'The gentleman has three abstentions.' The three abstentions are lust, fighting, and gain. The Nirvana Sutra speaks of three diseases. The three diseases are greed, anger, and delusion. Greed is the same as greed for gain. Anger is the mechanism that triggers fighting. The word delusion probably refers to infatuation with lust. What Buddhism calls the three diseases is what Confucius calls the three abstentions. This is what Confucianism and Buddhism have in common."</p>
<p>Lao Tzu said, "Do not value the worthy, so that the people will not contend," which is also an abstinence from fighting, meaning abstaining from anger. "Do not value goods that are hard to obtain, so that the people will not steal," which is also an abstinence from gain and greed. "Do not show desirable things, so that the people's hearts will not be disturbed," which probably includes wealth and lust, and the meaning of abstaining from lust and delusion is especially clear. This is what Confucianism, Buddhism, and Taoism have in common.</p>
<p>In the Old Testament of Christianity, Moses twice declared the Ten Commandments, which include "You shall not murder, you shall not commit adultery, you shall not steal, you shall not covet," etc. Murder is the result of fighting. Adultery, stealing, and coveting are lust, delusion, greed, and gain. This is also what Christianity has in common with Confucianism, Buddhism, and Taoism.</p>
<p>The Koran says, "Whether hidden or visible, restrain lust." It also says, "Do not shed blood, do not fight for land and expel people." It also abstains from fighting for others and abstains from greed for profit, which is the path to disaster. This is also what Islam has in common with Confucianism, Taoism, Buddhism, and Christianity. In the Analects, in youth, the blood and energy are not yet stable, so one abstains from lust. In adulthood, the blood and energy are vigorous, so one abstains from fighting. In old age, the blood and energy have declined, so one abstains from gain. Because of the difference in age and the change in blood and energy, one abstains at any time, which is very practical.</p>
<p>The Nirvana Sutra uses impure contemplation to treat greed, anger, and the contemplation of cause and condition to treat delusion, teaching people the way of self-cultivation, which is also very practical. In short, although the five religions have different detailed arguments regarding the three abstentions, they all teach people to avoid evil. After the lecture, the basic members' meeting was held. It is heard that in the next session on January 12, Mr. Shen Daling will still speak on the common points of the five religions.</p>
<h3>The Civilian Women and Children's Hospital's New Building Is Completed; Opening Ceremony Held Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Civilian Women and Children's Hospital at 995 Kang'nao Road in this city held its opening ceremony yesterday for its new location. Many well-known figures in the medical field attended the ceremony, and some signed on the spot to donate funds. The hospital was originally located on Weihaiwei Road. Since moving to the new location on Kang'nao Road in June of this year, the number of patients has increased dramatically, because the area around Kang'nao Road is full of factories and civilian residences, and the Civilian Women and Children's Hospital is designed for these civilians. The hospital was originally intended to serve refugees, but because the refugee problem in this city has improved, it has been changed to serve civilians and laborers. According to a report released by the hospital, from December of last year to June of this year, the hospital's activities have expanded from a purely maternity hospital to a formal hospital, including the training of medical personnel and clinical publicity, and a maternity training class has been established. Within these six months, the hospital has admitted a total of 629 patients. Although many patients have left the hospital, the service has always maintained a fairly high standard. The maternal mortality rate is only 0.74%, and the infant mortality rate is only 0.31%. The report also points out that the hospital is currently in need of a well-equipped operating room and a laboratory, as well as a car and an ambulance.</p>
<h3>Yu Songyun Appointed Director of Medical Administration</h3>
<p>Dr. Yu Songyun, the former director of the China-Germany Hospital in this city, went to Europe and the United States to study health services under the orders of the National Government in the autumn of 1935. After returning to China, he devoted himself to managing the hospital, and the hospital's affairs were very developed. He was especially enthusiastic about running the civilian obstetrics department, benefiting the people, and was praised far and wide. It is recently heard that the National Government has appointed him as the Director of the Medical Administration Department of the Ministry of Health. He is expected to use his knowledge and make grand plans, and will definitely be able to contribute greatly to the measures of health administration.</p>
<h3>Passengers Going to Nanyang Must Have Smallpox Vaccination Certificate</h3>
<p>Passengers going to various places in Nanyang from this city must have a smallpox vaccination certificate due to the inspection and restrictions of the Fudi government. Those who take the boat to Xiaolü Song or Sibu must pay an additional Yilu currency of 4.6 yuan per person for the third class and 3.5 yuan for the fourth class. Those going to Xiamen and Hong Kong must have a certificate of having been vaccinated against smallpox and cholera. The certificate is only valid if it is issued by the Public Concession Health Department. Passengers going to Xiaolü Song and Java must have a certificate of having been vaccinated against cholera and smallpox, otherwise they will not be allowed to land.</p>
<p>Post Office Will Be Closed Completely on New Year's Day</p>
<p>The Postal Administration announced that New Year's Day on January 1 of next year will be a holiday. The Administration and its branches will be completely closed on this day. Except for the special delivery of New Year's mail, all other deliveries will be suspended until January 2 and 3, which will be handled as usual on Sundays.</p>
<h3>Tragedy and Joy; Contradictions of Christmas Eve; Entertainment Venues Received Millions of Yuan; 82 Bodies Found on the Streets</h3>
<p>Every Christmas Eve, Westerners and those who have been influenced by Western customs will celebrate and have fun. Although prices have soared and people's lives are exhausted this year, there are not a few who have become rich through hoarding and manipulation. Therefore, the grand occasion this evening is still as good as in previous years. It is heard that the seven top-notch dance halls in this city each had an income of 25,000 to 30,000 yuan from door tickets, dance tickets, and food, totaling 200,000 yuan. The thirty second- and third-class dance halls also had an average income of 10,000 yuan each, which is 300,000 yuan. In addition, the income from nightclubs, wine shops, and casinos is even more considerable. Therefore, it is estimated that the city consumed no less than one million yuan this evening, which is a staggering amount. However, only the rich can enjoy the night, but because the weather was suddenly cold that day, the poor people who were sleeping in the open groaned and screamed, and those who froze to death were even more numerous. According to the statistics of Pushan Villa, there were 23 adult bodies and 59 child bodies on the streets that evening, totaling 82 bodies. Even on Christmas Day, there were 32 adult bodies and 47 child bodies, totaling 79 bodies. The depth of the social contradictions in Shanghai can be seen from this.</p>

<h3>American and Italian Sailors Engaged in a Martial Arts Play in a Dance Hall; Approximately 25 People Were Injured on Both Sides; An Italian Officer Took the Blame and Apologized to the Americans</h3>
<p>The English-language Great American Evening News reported that at 11:00 p.m. on Christmas Eve, a rare and extremely violent fight occurred in the Da'hu Dance Hall on Jing'an Temple Road between American Marines and sailors and Italian sailors, totaling about 100 people. As a result, 25 American and Italian soldiers were injured and returned to their respective hospitals for treatment. It is heard that during the fight, an Italian non-commissioned officer drew a gun at the entrance of the escalator in the Da'hu Dance Hall. Before he could use the weapon, he was violently pushed and fell down the escalator, suffering a head injury and dying. However, Italian officials replied to reporters this morning that they did not recognize the incident of death.</p>
<p>Italian Officer Has Formally Apologized</p>
<p>It is heard that an Italian officer visited the headquarters of the U.S. 4th Marine Regiment yesterday morning and formally apologized for this minor fortunate incident, admitting that the fault lay with the Italian side and promising to compensate for all damages. U.S. Marine officers remained silent on the matter this morning. As for the losses of the Da'hu Dance Hall, it is estimated that 5,000 yuan in unpaid accounts and 2,000 yuan in damaged furniture.</p>
<p>A Quarrel Started the Trouble, and Italian Soldiers Used Force</p>
<p>It is heard that the matter started because an American and an Italian sailor had an argument in the corridor of the Da'hu Dance Hall. They did not use force and dispersed. Then the American sailor returned, and the Italian sailor told four other Italian soldiers about the argument. The four Italian soldiers jumped up and beat the American sailor together. The rest of the Italian sailors in the dance hall also showed off their strength and bullied the few, joining the siege. At that time, 12 American Marines and two sailors saw this and rushed into the siege to help the American soldier who was being beaten. The order was in chaos for a while.</p>
<p>A Blonde Dancer Was Thrown Violently</p>
<p>Suddenly, a soldier grabbed a dancer with golden hair and threw her out violently, causing her to fall behind a bronze drum. A few minutes later, an American soldier grabbed the Italian soldier and slammed his head against the piano as revenge. When the mutual beatings were in full swing, an Italian non-commissioned officer suddenly drew a handgun, intending to stop the beating. However, before he could fire, he was hugged by an American sailor and pushed out of the dance hall, falling down the escalator.</p>
<p>Military Police Arrived and Stopped the Fight</p>
<p>After the two sides mixed for about 20 minutes, several Indian police officers and American and Italian military police arrived, but they could not resolve the situation. It was not until American and Italian officers arrived on the scene that they ordered them to stop. The wounded soldiers were all sent to the hospital in private cars. Several American soldiers needed surgery. The extent of the Italian soldiers' injuries is unknown.</p>

<p>The Chengdu Road Police Station recently received a secret report from an informant that a large number of Hangzhou gang thieves were planning a robbery in the Yuancheng Inn in Dongxinqiao. After receiving the report, the police went to arrest them and arrested six thieves, Hang Xueliang, Ding Kunshi, Zhu Ada, Zhu Wangshi, Xu Quanbao, and Fan Quangen. Yesterday, they were sent to the First Special Court to apply for detention and were tried by the judge in the Second Criminal Court. The police lawyer appeared in court and stated the details of the case, and said that the defendants had been criminally punished before and that there was a lot of evidence of their crimes this time. However, because the main criminal was at large, he had not been investigated, etc. After reviewing the situation in court and briefly asking the defendants about their age and origin, the court ordered their detention and adjourned the trial to a later date. The Jing'an Temple Police Station arrested a thief, Xu Zhonglian (26 years old) from Guangdong, the day before yesterday, and sent him to the First Special Court yesterday, where Judge Liu approved his detention for investigation.</p>

<h3>Important News Summary</h3>
<p>The Zhenhai Shanghai Fellow Villagers Association's Fundraising Committee for Disaster Relief has decided to hold a meeting on the 28th of this month to effectively promote fundraising.</p>
<p>According to industry news, the rice shortage in Shipu has become increasingly serious recently. Rice shops have closed their doors because they have no goods to sell. As a result of hoarding by the rich, there is nowhere to buy rice, leaving the citizens with nothing to live on. At around 7 p.m. on the 17th of this month, more than 100 poor people gathered and rushed to the house of the town chief, Yu Yaoting, to petition. The situation was turbulent. The town chief, seeing that there were many people and opinions and that the situation was not good, took refuge through the back door. Later, the town government's clerk came out to persuade them to disperse, but to no avail. After reporting to the magistrate of Xiangshan County and receiving a reply, the crowd dispersed reluctantly.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Culture, Calligraphy and Painting Association has scheduled an exhibition at the Daxin Company Gallery from January 14 to 20, 1941. Since the expansion of the solicitation in mid-January, Zhang Shouyong, Wang Fuchang, Chu Deyi, Tang Ken, Shen Enfu, Wu Dongmai, Yu Baoqing, and dozens of others have successively participated, totaling more than 150 people. The deadline has already passed. At 3 p.m. yesterday, a discussion meeting was held by the staff of each group at 16 Longmen Road, resolving to follow the published method and collect Category B products from January 2 to 6, 1941 (9 a.m. to 12 p.m. and 2 p.m. to 5 p.m.). The review date is January 7 and 8. Category A products will be collected from January 7 to 10 (office hours are the same), and a list of products will be made and distributed to each member. When submitting the items, they must be filled in with regular calligraphy on both the original and duplicate copies. One copy will be signed and sealed by the receiving office and handed to the submitter for safekeeping, and one copy will be kept by the association for reference. Xiong Songquan proposed that the paintings should be displayed separately, which was unanimously approved.</p>
<h3>Statement from the Already-Stopped "Life Evening News"</h3>
<p>It is learned that the "Life Evening News" will be sold in the market on New Year's Day next year. It is heard that it is reorganized by a certain news agency, but it is completely unrelated to the "Life Evening News" that was popular in Shanghai in 1937. According to reports, the newspaper announced its cessation on the day after the outbreak of the August 13 Shanghai War, and all internal personnel were dismissed.</p>
<h3>Medical Achievements of the Famous Doctor Chen Susheng</h3>
<p>The famous doctor Chen Susheng, residing in Shangxianfang, Xiafei Road, is proficient in medical skills and well-known in Shanghai. He is good at treating difficult and complicated diseases. A certain Song family in Lane 358, Xiafei Road, whose daughter-in-law suffered from uterine cancer with collapse, leucorrhea, palpitations, and swelling, and had difficulty eating and sleeping, was treated by Dr. Chen, who prescribed a secret suppository. In less than a month, all the symptoms disappeared. She had returned to her hometown of Hankou for recuperation a month ago. Cancer is the most tragic disease for women, and the patients suffer very much. Dr. Chen's treatment results are worth noting.</p>
<h3>Correspondence</h3>
<p>Regarding the matter, our client, Mr. Xu Hongsheng, stated that upon reading the Shen Bao newspaper of the 24th of this month, the news article "Xu Hongsheng Demands 300,000 in Bride Price from Zhang Benxing" contains sections that not only greatly deviate from the facts but are also deliberately fabricated. After investigating, on the 14th of this month, I learned that Zhang Changfa (also known as Zhang Benxing) was suspected of abduction after questioning when my daughter did not return home. While I was searching everywhere, a person named Hu Songquan suddenly came representing Zhang's father to propose marriage, using both soft persuasion and threats to the extreme. Although I explained that my daughter was already engaged, Mr. Hu insisted that if I stubbornly refused, I might never see my daughter again. To meet my daughter and understand the truth, I had no choice but to pretend to agree, but I stated that I must first meet my daughter and inquire about the truth before discussing further. Therefore, I instructed my wife to accompany them. When Mr. Hu led my wife to a room in the Yangtze Hotel, she found my daughter crying. Upon questioning, she learned that she had indeed been abducted and raped by Zhang Changfa. I then reported this to the Zhabei Police Station, who confirmed the facts and transferred the case to the police station for investigation and handling, where he is still being detained. Yet, the newspaper daringly wrote, "The daughter voluntarily promised herself to someone, the father demanded an exorbitant bride price, asking for as much as 300,000 yuan, and when negotiations failed, he turned him over to the police station," "Such intimidation is purely opportunistic extortion," and "It is said that the daughter has sincerely turned to Zhang, criticizing her father for insisting on obstructing the marriage of his children and demanding payment." These statements are truly shocking. The Yangtze Hotel room is owned by the Zhang family, and it was my wife who went to the Yangtze Hotel. I, myself, only reported to the Lao Zhabei Police Station after learning about it and did not go to the Yangtze Hotel beforehand. How could there be any truth to the story of gathering a crowd to catch the adulterer and taking him to the Yangtze Hotel to demand a bride price? Furthermore, how could there be any intimidation or extortion? As for my daughter sincerely turning to Zhang, there are confessions as evidence, so how can such reckless statements be tolerated? It is a deliberate fabrication. Moreover, the facts of this matter are clear and will be resolved in due course. It is especially inappropriate to mislead the public with alarming words and injure people with slanderous rumors beforehand. The intention is clear. The content published by the newspaper is a deliberate distortion of the truth by the contributor. To correct the misunderstanding, I have no choice but to ask you to publish a letter of correction. Your newspaper has always upheld accuracy in its reporting. I am writing this letter specifically to request that you make a correction. I would be most grateful. Respectfully submitted to the Shen Bao Newspaper Office, Lawyers Wu Linkun and Du Xiaoxiang, December 26th.</p>
<h3>Three Robbers Hijack Yunfei Car Attempt to Kidnap Glass Factory Owner Factory Owner Not There, Robbers Return Empty-Handed Car Found on Route Ferguson, Avenue Petain</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning around 8 a.m., Wang Taiyao, the owner of the Zhonghan Xinji Glass Factory on Route Hoche, Public Concession, was nearly kidnapped by robbers. The details of the case are as follows:</p>
<p>Three Robbers Hire Car, Driver Expelled</p>
<p>Yesterday morning at 8 a.m., the Jing’an Temple branch of the Yunfei Car Company suddenly received a phone call requesting a car be dispatched to the intersection of Route Dufour and Yongle Village in West Shanghai. The branch dispatched a local driver named Yang Shengquan, driving car number 12376, to the address. Upon arrival, three men got into the car and instructed the driver to go to Route Cassini, Caojiadu. When the car reached the entrance of a small tea garden there, the men suddenly revealed their fierce expressions, pulled out handguns, forced Yang Shengquan out of the car, and drove off at high speed.</p>
<p>Kidnapping Attempt Fails, Original Car Found</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, after the robbers seized the car, they joined two other robbers, totaling five people, and drove the car to the Zhonghan Xinji Glass Factory at 776 Route Hoche, where they stopped cautiously. They got out of the car one after another and rushed into the factory. Three of the robbers each held a handgun and barged into the accounting room, while the other two robbers stayed outside to guard the entrance. Two of the robbers asked if the factory owner, Mr. Wang, was present. The accountant, Mr. Jia, replied that he was not at the factory. The robbers left disappointed, got back into the car, and sped away. Around 9 a.m., the car was discovered at the intersection of Route Ferguson and Avenue Petain. The police ordered the car company to reclaim it. Since the robbers hijacked the car with the intention of kidnapping the factory owner, Wang Taiyao, Wang was summoned for questioning. The police are currently actively pursuing the perpetrators.</p>
<p>Educational News</p>
<h3>Statistics on Education in Guangdong Province School Numbers Decrease, Student Numbers Increase</h3>
<p>(Shaoguan, 25th Dispatch) Since the start of the War of Resistance, education in Guangdong Province has made considerable progress, and educational funding has also increased annually. According to statistics, there are currently 14,992 primary schools with a total of 985,912 students. Due to the expansion of the war zone, the number of schools has decreased by 829 compared to the previous year, but the number of students has increased by 14,402. There are currently 129 secondary schools with 98,165 students, a decrease of 4 schools and an increase of 1,070 students compared to the previous year. The number of schools this year has decreased slightly due to the impact of the war, but all schools have universally increased class sizes as much as possible to accommodate students withdrawing from the war zones. Educational funding in 1937 was 1,704,267 yuan, which increased to 2,206,853 yuan in 1939, and to 2,416,868 yuan this year.</p>
<h3>President Sa Bendong Talks About Recent Situation at Xiamen University Gradual Stabilization After Moving to Changting Plans to Establish College of Science and Engineering Next Year</h3>
<p>(Guilin Airmail) Dr. Sa Bendong, president of National Xiamen University, went to Chongqing some time ago to report on his duties and seek instructions on school affairs. He has completed his public duties and flew to Guilin on the evening of the 13th of this month. Upon hearing the news, the reporter visited him and learned about the recent situation of the university as follows: "Our university currently has four colleges: Liberal Arts, Science, Law, and Commerce, with a total of thirteen departments and more than 600 students. Since Xiamen fell two years ago, we first moved to Gulangyu and then to our current location in Changting. Because we had prepared in advance, the loss of books, instruments, and general equipment was minimal. The environment in Changting is quite good and suitable for running a school. The cost of living is also low; students can live on 15 yuan a month. It is a pity that the funding is too little, ranking second to last among the national universities, only slightly more than Northeastern University. Since being converted to a national university, the annual funding has been more than 200,000 yuan. In 1940, including various temporary expenses, it was only about 400,000 yuan. Although the recurring expenses will increase next year, they will only be more than 270,000 yuan. What is currently gratifying is that the consistent good academic atmosphere has always been diligent and is even stronger than before the War of Resistance. Furthermore, all kinds of equipment, at least the minimum necessary, are sufficient for use, especially more than 120 kinds of Western magazines, which continue to arrive, providing reference and browsing. This is probably unmatched by any university in the interior. Another advantage is that the cost of living in the location is not high, so it is hoped that life can be easily maintained. As for the problem of recruiting outstanding professors, it was extremely difficult in the first two years, but it has been completely resolved this year, and it should be possible to fulfill this wish in the future. Fujian Provincial University has been ordered to close down this summer. The Provincial Government will independently manage the medical and agricultural colleges separately, while the law college will be merged into our university. After inspecting the various public and private colleges and universities in the province, there is still a lack of a college of engineering, and at present, our university only has an electrical engineering department. Therefore, I submitted a plan to the Ministry of Education to add a college of engineering during my trip to Chongqing, which has been approved by the Ministry of Education. It can be realized in 1941. Initially, it is planned to temporarily combine the college with the School of Science and call it the College of Science and Engineering. When the content is enriched and the grades increase in the future, it will develop independently."</p>
<h3>Second Reorganization Committee of Refugee Children's Home</h3>
<p>(Dahua News Agency) Since the public election of directors Huang Yuzhai, Le Gengbao, He Wuliang, Gu Wensheng, Zhang Lianfang, Huang Zhaolin, and Zhu Daxun to organize the Reorganization Committee of the Refugee Children's Home in this city, all the progress and the content of the first resolution have been reported in various newspapers. It is now heard that the committee held its second resolution meeting on the 25th of this month at the Huizhong Entertainment Club. All members, initiator Sheng Zhiren, accounting advisor Li Wenjie of the Home, and General Director Pan were present. Chairman Huang Yuqi declared that the committee is engaged in all reorganization affairs of the difficult Home with a fair attitude. He is honored that Mr. Sheng and others came to participate and contribute their opinions. However, after investigating the resolutions of the previous meeting, after being sent to Director Yuan, they have all been implemented one by one. The reorganization work seems to have come to an end at this point. The colleagues of the committee all have fixed positions and cannot continue to engage in this work for a long time. The chairman intends to ask Director Yuan to convene a full board meeting immediately and publicly elect experienced and capable people to reside in the Home to take full responsibility. Then, General Director Pan reported on the handling of the resolutions of the Reorganization Committee, as ordered by Director Yuan: (1) The case of the Home receiving commissions on donations has been handled by the Reorganization Committee by sending a letter inviting accountants Xi Yushu and Wang Sifang, who have agreed to investigate the Home's accounts, and the truth will soon come to light. (2) The case of the Home's staff using funds privately without the approval of superiors is being handled in the same way as the first item. (3) The case of the Home's staff defaulting on accounts has been strictly ordered by the cashier's office to repay within a time limit. (4) The case of the Home's staff failing to work effectively has been submitted to the Reorganization Committee with a list of the Home's staff and servants, with additional evaluations (the original list is attached). (5) The case of the Home's staff receiving salaries but not working has been clarified at the previous meeting. (6) The case of the refugee children's band accepting monetary gifts has been absolutely prohibited. (7) The case of the refugee children's band insulting a female teacher has been strictly ordered to the teacher of the band, Su Yongnian, to properly teach and strictly restrain the refugee children in the future. The refugee children who caused the incident have also been severely punished according to the rules of the Home, and the female teachers have drafted a plan for all the refugee children to salute and apologize to their colleagues in the counseling office. (8) The case of the female teachers' disrespectful behavior towards the director has been sent by the counseling office of the Home to Director Yuan with a letter expressing their gratitude (the original letter is attached). As for the temporary motions, all the resolutions have been properly implemented one by one. It is heard that Chairman Huang has complied with the request of all the staff and students of the Home and intends to attend the anniversary week next Monday to give a speech. The Foya School at 37 Route Cardinal Mercier, Shanghai, has a long history and a high reputation in the field of deaf-mute education. The school performed a pantomime at the Ethnic Revival Day and Christmas Day celebration on the 25th, and also held an art exhibition, which was very grand.</p>

<p>As soon as the central line kicked off, Youyou launched a fierce attack. Sun Damiao broke through on the left, but was blocked by the Russian team. Soon after, Sun Damiao used the same trick again, advancing to the baseline and crossing the ball to the center. Wang Caigao passed the ball to Sun Tuitui, who swept his right foot, and the ball went into the net, opening the scoring. This was less than twelve minutes after the kickoff. Soon after, Sun Tuitui again received Wang Caigao's assistance, shot the ball immediately, and the goalkeeper Dadachengu was unable to save it, and the ball flew into the net. Youyou scored two goals in fifteen minutes, and the offensive was great. After twenty-five minutes, Youyou Sun Damiao made a comeback, advanced quickly along the side, and passed the ball to Wang Caigao. Wang did not take credit for himself, but passed the ball to right forward Shen Jinda, who pulled up his foot and sent the ball into the net, making it three to zero. Youyou took the lead in the overall situation. Then Shen had another shooting opportunity, but unfortunately, it hit Dadachengu's hand. The first half ended, and Youyou took the lead with three to zero.</p>
<p>Duck Egg One</p>
<p>After the break, the two teams reorganized and fought again, but the Russian Emigrant Association still showed no improvement. Sun Damiao intercepted the opponent's ball and lightly passed it to Caigao, who dribbled it in. The goalkeeper Dadachengu fell to the ground to save the ball. Cao Qinfang failed to catch up. After two minutes, Sun Jinshun passed the ball to Wang Caigao, who stepped forward and shot, but the goalkeeper caught it in his arms, missing two good opportunities. Youyou's offensive did not slow down. After ten minutes of refining, Wang Zhangbao sent the ball to the front, Wang Caigao waited for the ball to come, and kicked it into the goal. The goalkeeper did not defend against it, and the ball was lost again, making it four to zero. The Russian Emigrant Association launched a counterattack, and the right winger Kechen shot alone, but Zheng Tongyu jumped up and caught the ball, turning danger into safety. Youyou launched another attack, and Cao Qinfang dribbled the ball to the enemy's territory. Shen Jinda kicked at the goal, but the goalkeeper knocked it out a short distance. Sun Tuitui stepped forward and kicked the ball high and away. After that, both sides had corner kick opportunities, but neither side scored. When the legal time ended, Youyou eliminated the Russian Emigrant Association with four to zero and entered the replay week.</p>
<h3>Current Situation of Shanghai YMCA Basketball</h3>

<p>There are important changes to this year's Shanghai YMCA basketball rules, which are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Backboard: The backboard has been changed from a rectangle of 6 feet wide and 4 feet high to a fan shape of 54 inches wide and 35 inches high. (2) Basketball: The referee must test the air pressure of the ball by dropping the ball from a height of 6 feet (from the bottom of the ball to the ground) onto a hard floor. The rebound height should not exceed 54 inches at the highest and should not be lower than 49 inches at the lowest.</p>
<p>(3) Substitution: After scoring a goal on the field, a player may not be substituted immediately. (If a timeout is requested at this time, a substitution can still be made.) Before entering the field, after reporting to the recorder, the substitute player must stand outside the field and wait for the referee to call them before they can enter the field. Otherwise, it is a technical foul and a penalty shot must be awarded.</p>
<p>(4) Re-establishment of Lineup: Only when more than three substitute players from one team enter the field at the same time can a request be made to re-establish the lineup. Otherwise, the referee may not accept it.</p>

<h3>Food Prices Should, In Theory, Return To Calm But Secret Deals For Grade 2 Saigon Have Already Reached $89 If There Is No Speculation Or Manipulation The Market Should Return To Normal</h3>
<p>The foreign rice market reopened yesterday after closing for a day to commemorate the Yunnan uprising. Because the authorities were concerned about the excessive rice prices, they ordered all brokers not to enter the market for two weeks to suppress rice prices, and dispatched personnel to strictly monitor the market. Brokers were invisibly prevented from entering the market, and both transactions and access were lacking. Moreover, those who had hoarded goods were adopting a wait-and-see attitude. The foreign rice that had exceeded the time limit for payment had no one to show samples. The market transactions, except for domestic rice, only included low-grade broken indica rice and foreign yuan rice and broken yuan rice. The transactions did not exceed a thousand bags, but in off-market deals, Grade 2 Saigon was already selling at 89 yuan. However, both public sentiment and the market showed signs of stabilizing, as market rumors were unfavorable to hoarding, and the shipment of foreign rice was coming to Shanghai as scheduled, which was enough to directly suppress rice prices. In the future, if there are no illegal disturbances by brokers and no illegal trading by speculators, the market should gradually stabilize, and the arrival of a large number of diverted goods is necessary to stabilize prices. Yesterday, the prices opened within the limit in the market were only 86 yuan for Zhongguan Dajiao, 78 yuan for Chongmi Cha, 76 yuan for Broken Tip, and 65 yuan for Juexia. As for other foreign rice, none were opened.</p>
<p>Domestic rice, such as thick and thin japonica, are in a depressed state, and shippers are more willing to sell. At the same time, general speculators have no intention of buying more, resulting in a soft market. As a result, the opening prices have fallen slightly compared to before the holiday. Kunshan indica rice was seen at 102 yuan per dan, down to 98 yuan, and Qingjiao thin indica rice was seen at 92-3 yuan to 90 yuan, with original packs at 96-7 yuan.</p>
<p>The market for glutinous rice is also scarce, and it has fallen by a few yuan along with other goods. Yi Li white rice was 95 yuan, and Hong Kong white rice was 85-6 yuan, down to 83 yuan.</p>
<h3>Flour Market Trends Especially Firm Active Re-export Destination</h3>
<p>Wheat Flour Yesterday's foreign flour market situation especially tended towards firmness. After falling once before the holiday, public sentiment remains firm, due to the fact that the supply from abroad is quite limited. When the supply of domestic flour is lacking, we can only rely on foreign flour. Therefore, the newly arrived batch of foreign flour has been held tightly by the firms and not released. Yesterday, the re-export destination for the Beiyang gang was quite active, with a total of 14,500 bags transacted. The Flower Bird Clock Tower brand opened at 22 yuan and 50 cents, and the Flower God brand at 22 yuan and 80 cents. The High Brand Wild Boar needs 23 yuan and 10 cents due to lively sales to local customers, and the market is still stable.</p>
<p>Wheat The market was as firm as usual yesterday, as the supply from domestic and foreign sources was quiet, and the goods in the concession warehouses were even more lacking. Therefore, sellers are hoarding goods, and the asking prices vary. Both Chinese and Japanese factories feel that the raw materials are insufficient, and ultimately regret that there are no goods to buy. Therefore, the market situation remains quiet and firm.</p>
<h3>Oil Market Oil Prices Rise Daily One Yuan A Catty</h3>
<p>Yesterday's oil market saw few transactions due to the lack of a formal gold and foreign exchange market. Public sentiment was lacking in new stimuli, resulting in a lack of excitement. Soybean oil prices continued to revise the yuan price, and peanut oil stabilized, but the market tended to become active in the afternoon. As rumors spread that the gold price was rising sharply in off-market deals, public sentiment was shaken and the market improved. Qingdao raw oil alone saw a strong performance due to frequent increases in production prices. Sixty barrels of Qingdao raw oil were transacted in Shanghai, with prices ranging from 128 yuan to 27 yuan and 50 cents. Fifty barrels of new goods were priced at 130 yuan. Thirty pieces of Jiaozhou raw oil were priced at 95 yuan, and fifty pieces of new goods were priced at 97 yuan. Five hundred tins of Yantai canned fresh oil were priced at 125 yuan. Fifty barrels of Dalian soybean oil were priced at 116 yuan and 50 cents, with 250 barrels for January delivery priced at 117 yuan to 115 yuan and 50 cents, and then back to 117 yuan. 300 barrels for January delivery were priced at 117 yuan and 70.5 cents to 117 yuan, and the closing price rose by half a yuan. 200 barrels for February delivery were priced at 119 yuan to 18 yuan, and 50 dan of Dayou Factory soybean oil were priced at 94 yuan. Douzhuang raw oil has already sold for one yuan a catty. Soybean oil is one catty and one tael per yuan. One yuan per liter of rice, one yuan per catty of oil, and there is no good rice or good oil to eat. What a waste!</p>
<h3>Sugar Market Winter Mist Qing Up One Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market trended flat and weak, continuing to ease. The guild's clearing price for spot goods in the 24th group of white foreign warehouses was slightly lower at 79 yuan and 30 cents. Spot Dutch red was tight at first and then loosened, at 64 yuan and 30 cents to 64 yuan. Taikoo Car White B Mark did not trade the day before yesterday, but traded at 78 yuan and 50 cents yesterday, down two yuan from the 24th. CX Mark was 77 yuan and 20 cents, and DY Mark West Warehouse was 76 yuan and 50 cents, down one yuan, and the old goods in East Warehouse were 75 yuan and 50 cents. Winter Mist Qing continued to be available, priced at 61 yuan, up one yuan.</p>
<h3>Dried Goods from North and South Huizhou Honey Dates Sell Well Price Rises Another Ten Yuan</h3>
<p>Huizhou honey dates have been in short supply recently, and the inventory in the market is also scarce, while the needs from various parties are still active. Therefore, the selling price continues to rise. Yesterday, the market price for Huizhou Gong Tutu was 260 yuan, up ten yuan from before, with the usual additions and subtractions for higher and lower grades.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Items Matches Step Up To High This Week Up More Than Forty Yuan Soap Market Also Sees Price Increases</h3>
<p>The price of soap has been rising recently amidst the rising prices of various goods, causing the price to rise again. Currently, the market price of Guben soap is 23 yuan and 50 cents per box, Baixiangmao is 21 yuan and 60 cents, and Huangxiangmao soap is 17 yuan and 60 cents.</p>
<p>The price of matches has been rising frequently in recent days due to a lack of raw materials, and the factories cannot supply as much as they want, so production has been suspended, resulting in a direct increase in prices. Yesterday, the Beautiful brand sold for 360 yuan, Phoenix matches were 350 yuan, second-class miscellaneous brands were 325 yuan, and third-class miscellaneous brands were 310 yuan, up more than 40 yuan from last week.</p>
<h3>Medicinal Materials Medicine Euryale Ferox Low Yield, High Prices</h3>
<p>The new crop of medicinal euryale ferox is relatively poor this year, so the source is extremely scarce. Therefore, the market price has been gradually rising after the new crop was seen. A batch was recently opened at a high of 85 yuan. In July, the price of old goods was less than 40 yuan, so the price has more than doubled compared to before.</p>
<h3>Dried Lily Bulbs Recover</h3>
<p>The price of dried lily bulbs previously reached 50 yuan due to sluggish demand, but based on the cost, there must be a loss. Therefore, the arrival of goods has become rare, and the merchants are also watching and rarely releasing goods. As a result, the market has turned around and gradually recovered. The current market price has reached 65 yuan, up more than 15 yuan before and after, and labor is gradually increasing.</p>
<h3>Yarn Flowers Cotton Yarn Sees New High Prices, Reaching a Maximum of $1,425; Such Yarn Prices Will Also Affect the Cotton Market</h3>
<p>The yarn market, which had retreated the day before yesterday, saw further advances today. This was due to the closing prices in the exchange turning higher, and the forward prices still exceeding the $1,300 level, with only a difference of over $100 from Shuang Ma (Double Horse) yarn. Therefore, bullish sentiment was quite strong, and actual sales were relatively active. However, some in the industry did not appreciate the rise of Shuang Ma yarn, considering it too expensive, and thus leaned towards a bearish stance. Some even sold off Shuang Ma yarn and bought cheaper brands. As for "foreign clients," they only bought Shuang Ma factory orders, showing no interest in other cotton yarns, indicating a vast difference in sentiment between the two sides. As a result, when the market peaked, so-called insiders rushed to sell, and when prices dipped, buyers scooped up vast quantities. By the afternoon, the yarn market had reached a new high again.</p>
<p>Shuang Ma opened in the morning, with short sellers quite active, as the foreign exchange and gold markets were closed, giving the market a deceptive appearance of inactivity. Although bids were low, trading was not vigorous. The opening price was $1,385, briefly falling to $1,382. However, "foreign clients" and Shengda (a large firm) continued to buy. Still, the overall mood remained scattered, hovering around $1,385-86 for quite some time. Then, as supply tightened, it rose to $1,394, a price that held steady for a while. Unexpectedly, after 11:30 AM, with few sellers on the floor, a bullish trend surged, breaking through the $1,400 level. At the same time, foreign business was still good, closing at $1,409. A mid-day trading tally showed 4,835 bales traded, with Shuang Ma 20s yarn rising by $25. The amount purchased by each group is listed below: Local firms: 4,650; Hong Kong: 260; Jiangxi: 10; Xiamen: 10; Ningbo: 5. Total: 4,835.</p>
<p>The yarn market was highly enthusiastic in the afternoon, with the bullish trend intensifying. The price of Shuang Ma 20s initially reached $1,422, driven by a sense of panic. It was said that bullish investors had resumed buying during the previous day's fatigue, leading to short covering. It later reached $1,415, marking a new peak.</p>
<p>The current cotton situation remains firm, but factory purchases are not strong. They are not buying at the current high prices and lack speculative interest, so the situation is not as exuberant as the yarn market. However, if yarn prices continue to rise, the cotton market cannot be viewed with complacency; it may just be a matter of time.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods Overcoating Fabric Remains Popular</h3>
<p>Overcoating fabric maintained a lively trend yesterday, unaffected by the nearing end of the Gregorian calendar year. This is because market supplies are limited, with no local production, making future arrivals difficult. Costs are also rising, and buyers seem inclined to purchase only when needed. Customers tend to wait for extremely cold weather or for their old coats to become unusable before buying new ones, resulting in extended sales cycles compared to previous years. Transactions are mostly small and infrequent. Currently, black, gray, dark blue, and khaki overcoating fabrics, along with cashmeres, silver stripes, and patterned fabrics, are all in demand, creating a buoyant market with strong prices across the board.</p>
<p>Also, 24 pieces of cotton cloth were shipped to Rangoon today.</p>
<h3>Coal Indian Coal Soars</h3>
<p>Indian bituminous coal, which had previously fallen to $233-234 per ton due to a certain foreign firm releasing a large quantity of 4,000 tons, filling the market with available stock, rebounded sharply after foreign exchange rates plummeted last week. All firms immediately ceased sales, and even the old warehouse orders disappeared, causing prices to soar. Indian lump coal is now quoted at $240 per ton, and run-of-mine coal at $235 per ton, delivered to customers, plus cartage. However, actual transactions are scarce, with little real market activity.</p>
<h3>White Coal Suspends Order-Taking; Black Market Prices Rise Again</h3>
<p>Furnace-grade white coal has seen a significant decrease in sales over the past week due to the mild weather, resulting in a very quiet market for the local trade. However, managers and brokers, anticipating higher prices due to the continuous sharp decline in foreign exchange rates, have stopped taking orders and are holding onto their stock. They have also issued notices urging delivery, causing renewed anxiety after a period of stability. The black market has seized the opportunity to raise prices, with quotes increasing by nearly ten dollars per ton, with prices at door of $264 per ton, but this has not changed.</p>
<h3>Discussion on the Time Limit for Returned Checks</h3>
<p>— Ying Yongyu</p>
<p>After reading Mr. Ji Runmo's "A Small Issue Regarding the Time Limit for Using Checks," I thought about the time limit for returning checks. The clearing of checks at Chinese banks generally takes place at the check exchange. Mr. Ji's comment refers to the current check exchange situation. It would be reasonable for returned checks among banking firms to be returned the same evening for mutual clearing. However, the return of checks among firms is still cleared on the same day. Before the war, the check exchange also stipulated that returned checks from banks be returned by 8:00 PM on the same evening, with each bank sending a representative to handle the return of checks. After the war, as many banks moved their operations to the western district, which was farther away, requiring more travel time, the exchange changed its policy, requiring that banks return checks to the exchange by 5:00 PM on the same day (no checks accepted after 5:00 PM) and by 10:00 AM the next morning. As a result of this change, checks returned to the bank that submitted them for exchange are generally received after 10:00 AM the next morning, sometimes as late as 11:00 AM. Checks from money shops and non-exchange banks are collected by the exchange each day, so returned checks are also returned the same day. However, the collecting bank usually receives them between 9:00 AM and 10:00 AM the next morning. Checks from foreign banks (i.e., Bund banks) are collected by the exchange and then entrusted to the Bank of China for processing. The Bank of China also sends a representative to the exchange to manage the distribution. However, the deadline for collecting checks is still one hour earlier (10:00 AM on Saturdays and 11:00 AM on other days). The returned checks from the various foreign banks are gradually returned separately to the Bank of China on Avenue Joffre (now Huaihai Road), which then distributes them in batches to the exchange, which then returns them to the collecting banks. This process of multiple transfers makes the timing uncertain, sometimes as early as 10:00 AM, sometimes as late as 12:00 PM or 2:00 PM.</p>
<p>Currently, the return of checks among foreign banks is usually completed by 10:00 AM the next day. Chinese banks with accounts at foreign banks have until 12:00 PM on weekdays and 11:00 AM on Saturdays to collect checks. Returned checks are usually received by 11:00 AM the next day; checks received after that time are not accepted.</p>
<p>In short, there is no standard time limit for returning checks from foreign banks at the exchange, which needs to be improved. My suggestions are:</p>
<p>(1) If the exchange continues to entrust the Bank of China with processing foreign bank checks, it should agree on a return time with the Bank of China, so that the Bank of China can collect all returned checks from the foreign banks by 10:00 AM each day and send them to the exchange by car at 10:15 AM, with no checks accepted after that time. The exchange should then return them to the collecting banks by 11:00 AM.</p>
<p>(2) For simplicity, the exchange should no longer entrust the Bank of China and instead open accounts directly with the foreign banks.</p>
<p>The goal of the above is to ensure accurate and prompt check returns, which would also help resolve the issue of check usability on Saturdays when banks are closed in the afternoon.</p>

<h3>This Is Just Winter</h3>
<p>— Yan Zhen</p>
<p>Mom was packing Dad's grass linen gown. The paper rustled. Mom glanced around. Dad was still reading the newspaper. Little brother was squatting on the ground looking at something. Mom took a scarf, tucked the paper package under her arm, glanced at older sister again, and went out.</p>
<p>Older sister cocked her head, her eyes turning to the ceiling. A large patch of yellowish water stains. She thought: Dad's workplace, ever since those cars came that day, Dad's been unemployed! It's been almost two months now. Dad says some of his colleagues are still doing fine, still working there. Whenever he mentions them, Dad gets angry! He often slaps the table and curses, "Damn them! Shameless bastards! I'd rather the whole family starve!"... Older brother is ambitious. He's going to the interior. He said, "This is just winter!"</p>
<p>"Older sister! Where did Mom go!" Little brother stood beside older sister at some point.</p>
<p>"Uh, Mom? Mom—Oh, Mom went to buy you something!" Older sister was suddenly stunned. She paused, then coaxed.</p>
<p>"Is Mom buying me fried eggs? Older sister!" Little brother loves fried eggs the most.</p>
<p>"Mmm!—" Older sister couldn't think of what to say, answering vaguely.</p>
<p>Little brother skipped away to play. Older sister picked up the sewing on the table, hearing Dad sigh heavily.</p>
<p>The door opened, cold wind rushing in. Older sister shivered, putting down the sewing in her hands. The thing to be altered for older brother was Dad's old cloth gown. Mom came back from the vegetable market. Carrying a bamboo basket, the faded scarf wrapped around her head had been pulled down to her nose. She came in, closing the door behind her. Little brother dropped his paper figure and rushed over, tugging at Mom:</p>
<p>"Mom! Did you buy me fried eggs?"</p>
<p>Mom didn't answer. She put down the basket, rubbed her hands, and first took off her scarf. Older sister saw Mom's shoulders hunched inside the worn padded jacket, her body trembling.</p>
<p>"What? Noodles again! Noodles every day! I don't want it! I want rice! I want fried eggs!" Little brother took off the newspaper covering the basket, and when he saw noodles, he started to cry.</p>
<p>"Good boy! Don't cry, don't cry. You want fried eggs, Mom will buy them tomorrow." Mom said softly, glancing at Dad.</p>
<p>Little brother cried. His body twisting and turning, banging against the wall.</p>
<p>"Good brother, don't cry. Mom forgot today, she'll definitely buy them for you tomorrow." Older sister picked up little brother, using the corner of her clothes to wipe the tears on his face.</p>
<p>Dad, sitting in the corner, flung the Shen Bao newspaper on the table, sighing heavily.</p>
<p>Dark clouds gathered thickly, the sky tightly drawn, the north wind howling wildly. It was going to snow! On the glass window of the house opposite, the red light of a fire flickered, bending and curving upwards, and smoke curled from the chimney extending outside the wall.</p>
<p>Older brother said, "This is just winter!" Older sister thought, unconsciously holding little brother in her arms a little tighter.</p>
<h3>A Prediction</h3>
<p>— Shui Rong</p>
<p>New Year's "red market" prices on the market are high: Clams cost over 7,000, American dollars are at 500, yarn flowers and food have all surged. New high prices will emerge one after another. Clams are only a little short of 10,000. To match the custom of "ten thousand gold".</p>
<p>A certain celebrity gave a speech encouraging group rice purchases and repeatedly declared his "selfless" intentions. The letter was thousands of words long, extremely "sincere". The next day, rice prices rose again sharply. The authorities had no choice but to reinstate "price controls". It snowed heavily that day, and many poor people fought to fill their hunger with snow.</p>
<p>The administrators of ×× and other educational institutions jointly hosted people from all walks of life in order to "express their sincerity". During the dinner, they declared: "If there is any malpractice, they will surely be struck by lightning and burned. If there is any lying, they will die and have their tongues cut out in hell." Everyone present was moved.</p>
<p>The authorities, citing excessive "exports", have again levied "additional taxes". Big landlords and sub-landlords are eager to raise rents. The third landlord had no recourse and appealed to the "Housing Dispute Arbitration Committee". After registration and investigation, the verdict was: "In times of crisis, we should all be in the same boat. The landlords' difficulties are also beyond their control." The authorities then issued a notice strictly prohibiting large landlords and sub-landlords from illegally raising rents.</p>
<p>Public buses and trams have increased fares again, but the number of passengers has decreased sharply. The number of people "walking" has increased sharply on the streets, causing congestion.</p>
<h3>Suppressing Rice Prices and Punishing "Rice Profiteers"</h3>
<p>— Qian Jiong</p>
<p>Former Chengdu Mayor Yang Quanyu was sentenced to death by the military court for hoarding food. This is how treacherous merchants are dealt with in the provisional capital (Chongqing), and from that brief telegram, we can draw three points: First, manipulating food and disrupting public order not only hinders national policy but also helps the enemy. Second, the criminal was sentenced to death for hoarding only "several hundred piculs" of wheat, while our "hoarding experts" in Shanghai, who hoard no less than tens of thousands of bags of rice, are still at large. Third, the goods purchased by the traitor have already been called "stolen goods", but the Shanghai traitorous merchants openly put the stolen goods in the warehouse and are free and at ease, smug. In this short telegram, we feel that the law and order of "here and now" is so far apart from the strict military law of "then and there" that we can't help but exclaim that the Chinese people in Shanghai are so unconscionable, disregarding the nation and the state, and put their personal "wealth and glory" in the first place?</p>
<p>However, we are not saying that we will let them exploit us and be "helpless". Our 4.5 million citizens of Shanghai have the need to demand "survival", and we feel that there are two good ways to do this:</p>
<p>First, the so-called "rice profiteers" in Shanghai can also be judged by law.</p>
<p>Second, all the rice stored in the warehouses in Shanghai should be taken out and sold publicly at the purchase price.</p>
<p>Of the above two methods, the first one is more difficult to "implement" because they have the root of power; but the second method is still an effective sanction, as long as we all demand it unanimously, the local authorities will further strictly sanction the treacherous merchants and implement public sales of stored grain, and we believe it can be implemented quickly, not to mention that this method is also of great help to maintaining public order itself!</p>
<h3>Ambidextrous</h3>
<p>— Written by Ma Ge</p>
<h3>Zhangtai Willow</h3>
<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>Liu Rushi gently closed the door, forcing a smile, and said to Muzhai: "It's good for me to die on the bed with you. In life, we shall ask about the quilt; in death, we shall ask about the tomb, so that you won't be lonely under the springs." Muzhai also said: "When a person hangs themselves, the tongue must stretch out, which is also very uncomfortable. I remembered that there is a pond in the back garden, why not throw myself into the clear stream to show the loftiness of my integrity." Seeing that Muzhai did not like this and did not like that, Rushi was very unhappy. Then he said: "Since you have decided to die for integrity, drinking poison is good, hanging yourself is good, throwing yourself into the pond is good. Let's go to throw ourselves into the pond." Then he ordered the servants to set up an incense table in the hall, and accompanied Muzhai to burn incense and kowtow, worship the ancestors, and worship the late emperor, and then calmly die for integrity. After a while, the servant came to report that the table had been set up, please go downstairs to kneel down and worship. Liu Rushi then walked to Muzhai, took his hand to help him, and said: "Go to justice calmly, return my innocence, today is the day we become benevolent, please don't hesitate again." Qian Muzhai said: "It's just that I still have one thing unfinished." Liu Rushi was stunned and said: "What do you have to do?" Muzhai said: "I have written so many poems and essays in my life, I have proofread and sorted out a large part with you before, and there are still new works that have not been added. After my death, my descendants can print and publish them to leave them to the world. So-called, a horse dies and leaves bones, a person dies and leaves a name. It's a pity that some things have not been done yet, it's best to get it done, then my heart will be at ease." As soon as Liu Rushi heard this, he busy said, "Oh! What time is it, and you still have the heart to sort out your works? Truly valuable articles are like gold and stone, although they are temporarily buried, their brilliance will never be obscured, and someone will always discover and spread them. Su Dongpo once wrote a preface for Su Shunqin, and it was discussed like this, and what's more, the article is spread by people. If you die for your country and become famous, your great name will remain in the universe, are you still afraid that these articles will not be passed on to the world? Why bother overthinking this? Otherwise, why are the articles of Qin Hui and Yan Song not valued by the world, but spread among the people? Now that you have decided to die, you should not forget this matter. A few days ago, I heard someone say that a scholar in a certain place also agreed to die together because he did not want to be a slave to others. On that day, the scholar went to invite his friend to die together, but his friend said that many pigs in the pigsty behind had not been fed, and he was afraid that they would starve to death and could not make money, so he asked the scholar to wait a while for him to feed the pigs, and then go to die together. When the scholar heard his friend say this, he knew that his friend could not die, and immediately flicked his sleeves and left. Don't be angry, if you still want to be obsessed with your poetry collection today, then how is it different from the scholar feeding pigs? When Liu Rushi said this, her brows were tightly locked, and she looked even more unhappy. (22)</p>

<h3>Review of "Confucius"</h3>
<p>— Xu Daming</p>
<p>I must acknowledge that Mr. Fei Mu's directing technique is outstanding. In the past, we already appreciated his style in "Eternal Love" - the portrayal of characters' personalities, the creation of surrounding atmosphere to help the development of the story, and the use of "close-ups" to capture the center of each segment. Today, in "Confucius," apart from the "close-up" scenes not being significantly developed, the portrayal of the main characters and the creation of the atmosphere here have achieved great success. The opening scene of rescuing the poor with rice and "borrowing" rice from others with the cut firewood to feed them is quite touching. In front of this story, there is also the contrasting image of Yang Huo and Shao Zhengmao's cruelty - joking with the dead man hanging high as a "target" - which brings out how the "treacherous officials" were frantically slaughtering the people, and who were the ones who rescued the people. But we regret that Mr. Fei Mu neglected a more important aspect - the great mass scenes - the people's affection and support for those people; the people's deep hatred for those people and the emotions of wanting to kill them, we did not see this here.</p>
<p>As for the director's handling of the actors, first of all, we agree with Mr. Fei Mu's excellent approach of breaking the "star system." In "Confucius," we did not see anyone's role being particularly heavy, even Tang Huaiqiu, who played Confucius, was less emphasized than Zhang Yi's Zilu in many occasions. Of course, the deliberate reduction of Confucius's scenes may also have other reasons (fearing that people would deliberately promote "Confucianism," etc.). We believe that Zilu's prominence is because the director wants to use Zilu to inspire the audience's fighting spirit. This intention is quite good. As far as the harvest is concerned, the effect is not bad.</p>
<p>Secondly, in the director's handling of the overall flow of the play, we saw Mr. Fei Mu's painstaking efforts - giving people room for "thinking" everywhere. Whether it is the resolution after "depriving food between Chen and Cai" and the connection between the beginning and the end of traveling around the countries, there is a section of "process" left for the audience to "figure out" and "search." But there is one thing worth noting here, that is, it is difficult for the general audience with a lower level and unfamiliar with historical facts to understand, so this is worthy of discussion on the road of generalization and popularization. I would like to ask Mr. Fei what he thinks?</p>
<h3>Regarding the Actors</h3>
<p>Here, I can only talk about the main actors: The most successful actors, in my opinion, are Zhang Yi who plays Zilu and Xu Li who plays Yang Huo. They have quite excellent achievements in the portrayal of personality and the control of the play. The next are Yan Hui (Sima Yangcai), Confucius (Tang Huaiqiu), and Zigong (Pei Chong). Generally speaking, their acting skills are still above the average level. However, one point is worth pointing out, that is, in this film, there are many actors who are new forces. It cannot be said that this is the correct policy of the Minhua Company, because on the one hand, it can create a movement to promote newcomers and break the clumsy means of creating a few "stars," and on the other hand, in the current situation where the "isolated island" lacks acting talents, it is indeed a good trend. I hope this can also affect other film companies and promote more outstanding new talents in the "isolated island" film industry!</p>
<p>I am very happy to see the advent of this giant film, and at the same time, I hope that the Minhua authorities can develop forward more correctly based on this purpose. This is the expectation of each of our audiences, and it is also a sincere opinion contributed to the readers. I hereby introduce this film to the readers!</p>
<h3>Xiao Feng</h3>
<p>— Weng Zhongma worked as a student</p>
<h3>Talking About Confucius</h3>
<p>— Die Ye</p>
<p>The movie "Confucius" was shown at the Golden Gate (theater). I considered it vulgar and redundant and was unable to go, so I sent my son, Keyan, to watch it. When Keyan came back, I asked: "What are your impressions of 'Confucius'?"</p>
<p>"Father, I don't understand why they wanted to make 'Confucius'?" he said.</p>
<p>"Then how do you feel about Errol Flynn's Robin Hood?"</p>
<p>"That can't be compared. Robin Hood is just a robber!" he said.</p>
<p>"How about 'Empress of a Generation'?"</p>
<p>"That can't be compared either. She's just a prostitute!"</p>
<p>"How about Edison?"</p>
<p>"Compare...no, Confucius opposed using tricks to disturb the world," he said after a while.</p>
<p>"How about 'The Birth of Jesus'?"</p>
<p>"It can be compared,...but it can't be compared either. It seems that this film is more profound than 'The Birth of Jesus'," he said doubtfully.</p>
<p>"That's right. The greatness and significance of our film industry making 'Confucius' lies here. First: In the time of Confucius, there were countless bandits like Robin Hood, and those who 'used literature to play with the law' were people like Shao Zhengmao; those who 'used chivalry to violate the ban' were people like Yang Hu and Zhi Dao; 'flattery like Zhu Tuo' and having a child were like Nanzi. In European and American films, they are all strongly rendered. Edison can be considered a scientist of the generation. Without Edison, we would still be in the dark tonight; he gave us the enjoyment of our senses and advanced material civilization, but Confucius's development and contribution to mankind are on the other hand; in the society of the Spring and Autumn Period, some places are not much different from today's society. Mencius said: 'Fighting for land to fight, killing people to fill the field, fighting for cities to fight, killing people to fill the city.' Confucius came out to make a cry for justice. In the middle of the flow, he turned the tide, and his merits cannot be obliterated for all generations. In the era of killing and plundering in the Spring and Autumn Period, only Confucius was 'abandoning war', he did not speak of strange powers and disorderly gods. Although Confucius had three thousand disciples and seventy-two disciples, he was just like Jesus, working hard for a lifetime and not succeeding in one thing. But his great spirit, the five constant doctrines of 'benevolence, righteousness, etiquette, wisdom, and trust,' have enveloped everything in the world; later intelligent emperors used him to replace guns and cannons, so that the people were completely immersed in the shell of 'benevolence, righteousness, body wisdom, and trust,' and let him be the despotic devil alone; everyone was not allowed to betray etiquette, but he alone was allowed to be the master of all licentiousness, killing, aggression. Therefore, from the death of Confucius to the present, his reputation has been wrongly submerged for two thousand years. Now what you know is just the clay model of Confucius in the Hall of the Great Accomplishment and Sacred Teacher, and you have not seen the true, soulful, and true Confucius, just like the Westerners use Jesus. Jesus saves me, how can Jesus easily forgive all the sins of the people in this way?"</p>
<p>Keyan suddenly... "Ah! The reason why we want to perform 'Confucius' is this."</p>
<h3>Song Ya-haini's Powerful Rival</h3>
<p>— Yong</p>
<p>Song Ya-haini and Erna Andersen, one is familiar to us all, having reigned for several years as the "Ice Skating Queen" on the silver screen of Hollywood. The other is still unfamiliar, having only recently arrived in the United States and preparing to compete with Song Ya. They are both from Norway and studied ice skating techniques under the same teacher, so they are old classmates. Looking back, it is worth mentioning that in their hometown, Song Ya always defeated Erna to win the championship in four skating competitions. However, Erna was also highly regarded by her teacher. Erna herself admitted: "Song Ya practices harder than I do. Whether it rains or snows, she still practices outdoors continuously, while I rest indoors." Perhaps this is the reason for Erna's repeated failures!</p>
<p>Before setting off for the New World, Erna Andersen toured various European countries with her own theater group, receiving great acclaim. After arriving in the United States, she participated in the International Ice Dance event in New York, and her fame immediately spread. In addition to being skilled in ice skating, she is also proficient in skiing.</p>
<p>Erna is ambitious, hoping on the one hand to compete with Song Ya in the American film industry and no longer follow the old path of the past, and on the other hand, she also wants to introduce her new skiing skills to the film industry. She plans to realize these two points this winter.</p>
<h3>From Hollywood</h3>
<p>— Bao Lin</p>
<p>As American patriotism flourishes, the Hollywood film industry is also leaning towards producing a large number of patriotic films depicting the Navy, Army, and Air Force. A recently announced film is "Ten Men from the West," starring Tailuo Baohua.</p>
<p>One thing that proves that the Hollywood film industry is expanding its market to Latin America is that MGM has decided to make a film based on the deeds of the famous Mexican historical hero Zapata. The film is titled "Viva Zapata!" and stars the big star Robert Taylor. The original author of the book is the writer of "Long Live Freedom." (Note: "Long Live Freedom" is the famous work of Juarez Pires.)</p>
<p>David Niven is serving in the Royal Air Force in England. According to news from England, he has married the daughter of an officer in his unit. David Niven has narrowly escaped bombing several times.</p>
<p>Betty Davis shook hands and made peace with her divorced ex-husband, Harmon Nelson, in a cafe in New York. Therefore, rumors say that they may reconcile.</p>
<h3>"No One Shall Pass"</h3>
<p>The Chinese Cartoon Society will print 150,000 copies of the chorus song "No One Shall Pass" from its first work and distribute them widely to all sectors of society. Those who want to obtain the musical score can send a letter to the Chinese Cartoon Society at No. 38, Lane 201, Luba Road, and it will be sent to you. Also, groups requesting the score must specify the number of people.</p>
<h3>John Barrymore on Women</h3>
<p>— Si Hua</p>
<p>Dorothy Dorothy Coasts</p>
<p>Di Luo was my first wife. I selected her from the top candidates in the screen actor exam – this is not to tell others to do the same, because it is dangerous – but for me personally, it has had satisfactory results. When I first saw her on the screen, I thought she was the woman of my dreams. In fact, she was exactly as I dreamed her to be – this is what I experienced during the seven years we lived together.</p>
<p>Ailan Pa Lai She often bothered me with inquiries about Shakespeare. She initially came to visit about her university diploma, and we have not been estranged since, although we met by chance.</p>
<p>Garbo She is extraordinary. When we co-starred in "Grand Hotel," she gave up her regular lunch time and switched seats with me so that Kai Mala could face my left side. She ordered the producer, Arthur Brisbane, to leave – not knowing it was him. When I told her about it, she said, "Let's each have a drink!"</p>
<p>Fei Kang Pu Deng She is a British actress, one of the loveliest women. When my "Hamlet" was performed in London, she played Ophelia. Once, she drank too much and made a mistake, and I couldn't help but say to her, "Do it again!" So she broke up with me.</p>
<p>Daughter Diana She is a very beautiful girl. We had been separated for many years and only recently met. We were speechless. I finally said, "Shall we have a drink?" She replied very well: "I think we both need it, Dad!" Diana L is mature, beautiful and sensible.</p>
<p>Katherine Hepburn Among many actresses, she is one of the most outstanding. You see star-studded male actors overshadowing famous female stars, but Miss Hepburn always stands at the highest position on stage. She never makes a mistake on camera. She is indeed an excellent actor. This quality alone is enough to make me admire her immensely.</p>
