<h3 id="c14">英國對華政策無所憂疑 <a href="#c14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>『然則英國對華政策，亦與中國國民政府相去一千八百英里之遙乎？』『否！』此在隔昨英國下議院會議席上，交語之於工黨議員達維遜氏與外交决官勃特勒氏之間。針、對當前之疑竇，出以曼妙之屬辭，追求確切之解釋，終得嚴正之宣示；其言至簡約。其義至光明，僅此一問一答，而充溢乎其間者熱情也，正氣也。遐邇聞之，殆必爲之神往。蓋重慶與上海距離一千八百英里，中國國民政府在重慶，英國駐華大使寇爾爵士近頃雖留重慶，而大使館則在上海；卅月來上海所予國際之印象，亦即國際一般人士對於上海之視聽觀感，但覺其錯綜複雜，烏煙瘴氣；但覺其爲陰謀源泉，萬惡淵藪；旣爲國民政府政令權威之所未能控制，而所表現者醞釀者復輒與中國民族國家政府之利益相背道而馳；要非使節駐在國之首善之區，亦即非使節所宜逗留之地；對華政策而以上海爲依歸，則誠與國民政府相去一千八百英里矣！今者，達維遜氏質所憂疑，勃特勒氏闢爲不然。</p>
<p>溯自中國決心抗戰，發動軍事之後，英國所予中國種種聲援，殊難以數字表明其價値之如何高大；此固不惟中英兩國朝野所共喻，日本所疾首痛心，亦舉世共識之。祗以其間有關稅問題讓步屈從於前，東京談判隱忍妥協於後，天津白銀頻傳斷送之風說，凡百爭議俱有卑怯之姿態；是與實際上之對華聲援相矛盾，更與條約上之在華權益相牴觸、標揭政策如彼，言動懦弱若此；蓋已屢次引起中英輿情之不安與反感矣。况際此日本欲罷不能之時，外交攻勢與政治攻勢雙管齊下之日，以煙幕掩其離間分化之謀，以宣傳肆其熒惑淆亂之術；於是千方百計示人以上海非特國民政府所不得在重慶遙加控制，抑且完全在日本控制之下而儼然其爲與重慶對立之據點；使央國國會議員對英國政府之對華政策亦發生憂疑如達維遜氏者，夫日本方面在術數上之成功耶！抑英國當局在誠信上之失敗耶？</p>
<p>吾人對於英國政府，不諱言於今昔觀念之懸殊。析言之：往昔觀念，不但憂疑，抑且憤慨；以爲中國抗戰而不勝，至少必以英國在東方之權益爲殉，是又不但事　使然。抑且於意願上樂於促使之然。及其對德作戰而至今茲，對英觀念不但無所憂疑，抑且同情；此非吾人亦有所僧惡於德國，但同情於英國應付環境之艱難，同情於英國當局猶有踐行國際條的義務之信用與光榮。同情於英國朝野要人關於作戰所宣揚之種種論據。惟彼艱難，誠足使彼對遠東與暴力相勾結，甚至屈服之可能性，爲之相當增進；尤以英國若發見在歐戰中處於劣勢，甚至兢兢但求保全其歐洲之地位，而不得不放棄權益，退出遠東之時。則此項可能性更有行動化，具體化之虞。然亦惟以歐戰之故，吾人絕對不能想像英國當局不恤驅其國民，不恤賭其國運，以黃金赤血，保持其對於歐洲均勢，對於民族歷史之信用與光榮者，乃於遠東，不必以黃金赤血爲注者，竟顢預斷送之於一念之卑怯懦弱。吾人絕對不能想像英人所宣揚關於抵抗侵略，保持秩序，愛好民治自由公道之種種論據，竟以在遠東之苟且妥協而反證其論據乃爲虛僞之欺人之談。吾人亦絕對不能想像戰時之英國，在太平洋上出賣中國，與美國背道而馳，使美國加重其在太平洋上所負之責任，所受之威脅；而猶得在大西洋上取得理想中之美國充分後援。因此之故，歐戰雖予中國抗戰以若干不利之影響，爰熱望英法德蘇及早消弭爭端，言歸於好；然關於英國對華政策往昔所有之憂疑，至今茲而已完全消失。總之，中國若不繼續抗戰，則英國在中國抗戰時期之對華政策，當然隨之而拋棄，此得以英國對阿比西尼亞問題之態度爲例證。中國在繼續抗戰之中，英國若拋棄所標揭之對華政策，此其事實將爲退出遠東，此其意義則爲不戰而敗於日本，此其影響必削弱外援而加强敵方所得之外援；觀於德國圖謀拉攏蘇日，勸日結束侵華，其關鍵灼然。勃特勒氏以外交當局而答達維遜氏之憂疑以「否！」，其言鏘然有金石聲，有由來也。</p>

<p>昨日米市繼呈跌風、變化劇烈、近所罕見、買賣雙方均恐遭受意外之大虧、市面一挫、心思即餒、爭先出售、回籠貨陣陣推出、本鄕店舖豈是愚蒙、目見售方搖動、市貨充斥、略事添辦、不敢多進、故自早市初開喊聲即低二三角、及後步步下游、貶六七角不等、若特一號西貢自四十七元半、售至四十七元二三角、四十七元、火絞自四十六元售至四十五元半、四十五元二三角、二號西貢小紋、二號暹羅東京砶尖等中段貨，去路尤呆、跌一元左右、洋米因皆爲運日到頭擁擠、每日常扯有一二船抵滬、兼以前日續定整批後、洋商仍在繼續兜售、進戶嫌昂致未續妥、即回籠期貨亦在浮戶求脫下乏人接受、小絞三月份五十一元尙乏受主、一二號西貢抑低半元仍無去路、統市祗有回籠二號暹　二百噸做開、價五十二元至五十一元九角、</p>
<p>進口洋米、昨日又有鉅數洋米到滬、意輪曼林薩紐陀（譯昔）號、自西貢運來洋米八千零五十二包、碎米七千一百十三包、又苞米（即眞珠米）二萬零七百十七包、該項苞米係法商福家洋行合義。達孚等等洋行經辦、洋米多數係建源公司經辦、昨晨十一時許進口、停靠虹口順泰碼頭起卸、太古公司蘇州輪直接由暹邏裝來洋米二萬零五百三十四包、又濟南輪自海防裝來二千七百二十四包、從香港運來六千八百九十六包、怡和洋行德生輪自香港裝二千零二十六包、均於昨日午前抵埠、共計四輪運來四萬五千三百二十包之鉅（祖）</p>
<p>糯米相隨並貶半元、溧陽特元四十二元半、丹陽特元四十一元半、其國米厚薄粳及早晚稻內地來源、昨由虹口轉出者爲數寥寥、仍祗南港早晚稻三百餘包、而塲外暗盤交易、聞猶寥落、其開價亦續下降半元云云、總觀米市趨勢、視乎昨日之現象、則似尙難立足、或有較暴之跌風、若是以上次一番跌價而論、其最抵價一號西貢曾至四十三元半、較之昨盤尙差三四元、因度此决跌風、倘一時卒乏轉機之希望、則「路直瀉、回至以前原盤、實有其可能、或屆時更遭期貨出於意外之大批湧到、則回歸去年結東時之收盤行情，亦或意想中寨耳、能如是、則深為民食幸也</p>

<p>麪粉昨日續疲、二號紛廠盤在平賣期間、已無更動之可言、除限定七千五百包外、終無餘額佻給、故需要者仍不免仰給於回籠粉、惟連日客銷不振、聞外埠稅單忽有停發之消息、故人心帶餒、業外之買賣早巳吿絕、統市僅有內地鄉莊去化、成交老車牌棧單數千包、價爲十四元六角及六角五分、比前日續鬆角許、市面暫乏開展之望、</p>
<p>小麥昨日亦屬平淡、華廠與出口帮去化、均鮮發展、而市傳某廠有續定洋麥消息、廠方則又否認、故國麥不願輕脫、昨開之蘇州白麥仍須一十四元五角之價較决之常州麥則開二十四元、成交六車、</p>

<p>上日下落之紗市、昨則又復回好一些、此因外匯又見微縮、致多方重振旗鼓、再來拖進、所以檯面轉緊、而見上升、但實需不及上日之夥、目前紗市、深恐在徘徊之途、三月期多方依然看好、吸收之額、始終不棄、惟空方因其價格已登高境、作退一步着想、不願多作舉動矣、</p>

<p>另訊外棉市價、紐約棉市、昨日晨初開盤殊呈堅定狀態、先因投機者之購買而漲、後因同業及海外棉商之購買、結果收盤價格、較之上日漲起十二三磅音、印度連同預測、昨日漲起四羅比餘、埃及降落二十餘磅音、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、昨日人心殊為堅定、同業間交易頗稱活躍、售價甚爲高昂、然廠方同業殊爲靜寂、日方廠商亦然、茲將昨日棉市以美匯六元六八七五折合送廠價如下、</p>

<p>張惕菴澳門圖說云：「先是海舶，皆直泊廣州城下，至前明備倭，遷於高州府電白。後嘉靖十四年番舶洋人，言風雨潮濕貨物，請入澳晒晾，許之，令輸課二萬兩，澳有番目自是始。萬歷二十九年，西洋人利瑪寰入中國，始居澳門，以後西洋來者日衆，諸番稍稍引去。値國初以海氛遷界，凡沿海地皆棄勿收稅，西洋人改輸地租五百兩，西洋人聚居於澳自是始。」據後一說，則澳門有番民，始嘉靖十四年，非隆慶初也。葡萄牙人之到中國，必在嘉靖以前，天下羣國札病全書，載正德十二年已有佛郎機犯粵之事，况葡萄牙實始探地，豈獨遲遲數十年然後抵粵乎。當時未有地租，我朝天恩浩蕩，道並懷柔，念其遠涉重洋，梯航遙至，遂免其課稅，弗較錙銖，彼葡萄牙人感戴聖恩，欲圖報稱，又以皇朝不貴異物，雖有奇枝，未敢上陳，故就地方官歲輸五百余地租，以爲幸借一枝，不可無涓埃之報。疆臣請而許之，故自康熙以至乾嘉，未之有改。然則澳門一隅，始則南洋諸番，借以哂貨；繼則泰西諸國，借以寓居。葡人輸每歲之租，中國受爻聞之貢，亦巳久矣。頃自國家多故，疆臣遂不以區區之地租為念，而彼葡萄牙者，亦遂不納地租，蓋已三十餘年矣。</p>

<p>— 季甫芳</p>
<p>孤島在這個畸形的發展中，對於般正直的靑年，是很不相宜的。尤其是多數的職業靑年，他們已失去了教育的約束，在業餘時間，並沒有一定的工作，限制他們去做，如果沒有正當的娛樂和消遣，難免不在空暇時，去找尋他們放蕩的生活。</p>
<p>在上海的四周，所謂「歹土」裏，賭塲烟窟林立，變相的舞廳，下流的戲院，都是引誘靑年的魔網，脚踏到那裏，就好似喪失了一半的生命。</p>
<p>安分守己的靑年們，是不會自動跑去冒險的，可是親戚朋友鄰居中，總有人是那些地方的好主顧，而且他們還有着一種心理，就是自己去了，希望別人也去，於是在談話之間，不免將那裏的情形，講得天花墜亂：某人在賭上發了財，某人花了幾角錢，贏得數百塊；就是不賭吧，那裏的香烟，糖果，大菜，是隨便吃的。至於舞廳戲館的內幕，聽了更是心癢</p>
<p>年靑的人，都是好奇的，有這種「奇怪的地方」，總有心去見識一番。最初，祗有去嘗試一次的目的，他們也很知道，沒有能力常在那裏玩；可是到了那裏，神志就不淸了，被麻醉了，不到那裏去消磨時間，心裏總是不定，或是錢輸了，還想撈本，贏了錢，更想多贏。</p>
<p>職業靑年們，多是不十分寬裕的，初去時，一些花費，都是以零用錢來充用。日久之後，野心就大了，區區之數，是不够揮霍的。</p>
<p>所以我們看到很多的職業靑年，往往疏忽他們的事務，時常請假，夜間睡眠不足，辦事的時候不能振作精神。這還算小事，更有人因要錢揮霍，竟挪用公軟，或是欠了大宗的債，總是弄得失業，墮落，聲名塗地……一個好好的靑年，竟不可收拾了！</p>
<p>所以我希望一般職業靑年們，應當自省，目前的生活，巳是很困難，就是能勉强支持，還應該顧到將來，現在是一個蕩動的時代，到了將來，建設史新的時候，自己所有的技能，是否能應付，是否願意永遠維持自己的職業，不求上進呢？</p>
<p>所以我勸一般靑年們，在這個時候，應當硏究一種學問，以準備將來的事業，至少也應該修成一種技能。</p>
<p>在現在，那些地方，雖是五光十色，無奇不有，可是我們應當收東放蕩的心。</p>
<p>我們要硏究學問，增進技能，在業餘時間，應當到圖書館裏去，讀書會裏去，或是補習學校裏去。</p>

<p>在前天，我住××路××餅乾廠買餅乾，那時候，剛有一個外國老太，也在買這東西，那職員眞聰明，磅秤時他一只指頭在那法碼上一按，當然，這邊的物件因了那面的技巧，减輕相當的份量。輪到我，那位職員，還施出道「生財有道」的方法，我因爲早已看出了，請他重磅，西洋鏡拆穿了，他只得重新加上，差不多加了五盎司的餅乾。</p>
<p>在這一些餅乾上，也要施這手段，難怪一般生肘有道的米蛀蟲，要用前日報上所載誠先生的糴米人家注意的玩意了。所以在現在萬物騰漲的當兒，在這孤島上到處充滿着這一種「生財有道」的新辦法，希望先生們小姐們隨時注意。</p>

<p>當時何家兩位小姐，與江鎭睿談得甚爲投機。江鏡蓉道：「這回在北平，與尊大人盤桓了幾大，聽說兩位小姐，都是紡織專家。我們說高興了，發起這個織綢廠。本來我們想資本雄厚一些，大規模的做　做，也是你們尊大人說：你們初次辦事，　騐較少，待有了成績，不妨擴充。這回各方的股款，巳經劃到了舍親葉誦芬先生的銀行裏，兩位小姐創辦時要用款子，隨時可以支取。我現在可以把銀行滙單，交與兩位小姐，另外還有尊大人「封信咧。」他說時，便從一個文書皮夾裏，檢出兩行滙單，與何先生寫給他兩位女兒的信。還有他們的計劃意見，以及股東名單等等。江鏡蓉又道：「聽說你們兩位小姐之中，有一位要到歐美去攷察番，那楚最好的事了。從前我也曾出國一次，那也不過走馬看花，忽忽的看了看。怎及得你們兩位小姐，在外國多年，深加硏究。况且現在美國的工藝上，都是日新月異，往往有一種新發明，便有一種新變化。我們已是老朽了，不過國內辦那種綢廠的一種經歷，兩位小姐倘視我爲識途老馬，凡我所知道的，都可以奉吿。」何家兩位小姐也說道：『姪女輩年幼識淺，全仗江老伯隨時指導，我們以後還小時的要來叨教咧。』那大汀鏡蓉還留了兩位小姐，在國際飯店吃了午餐回去。席間所討論的，也無非關於絲織物的事。據江鏡蓉所談：「現代的織物，漸有一種混合的趨勢，不能冉分出絲織物，棉織物，毛織物，麻織物等種種名目了。總之它的原理，同爲纖維質罷了。譬如現在我們所辦的綢廠，純粹原料爲蠶絲的多，夾雜人造絲的也不少。而許多棉織物廠，所織出來的布，也有夾雜絲的原料與毛的原料在裏面的。其他如呢絨廠亦然，有夾絲的，有夾棉的，有夾麻的。所以在此刻還好像各種織物分淸了界限，若者爲綢，若者爲布，若者爲呢，若者爲葛，恐怕到了將來，混合的厲害，就不能分了。好在我們是跟隨時代爲轉移的，人家喜歡穿那種衣服，我們就織那種材料。不過穿衣服的人很少自己創出新花樣，開風氣倒又是紡織家的責任咧。（二四六）</p>

<p>— 强弓</p>
<p>我不明白黃達近來常常缺課的原因。同班中有的說他生病，有的說他下鄉去，更有的說他巳經找到一家店舖而學生意了。但這不是事實，無論如何一個人不能同時有病下鄕又學生意的，這明明是靠不住的傳說罷了。</p>
<p>黃達的功課頂做得好，道孩子是聰頴的。他知道失學的苦，他更知道繼續求學的必要。但物質沒有帮助他，使他不能不找一所夜間補習的學校來開拓智識的饑荒。</p>
<p>以這樣一個努力進取的孩子，該是不會無故曠課罷。然而兩個星期以來沒有看到黃達來聽課。眞的病了嗎？眞的下鄕去嗎？眞的進了商號去學生意嗎？終於我也懷疑起來了。其實補習性質的夜校，學生本來就是潮湧來一批，過了一息不知退到那裏去似的，開學時滿坑滿谷，放舉時冷落幾零的，又何必一個黃達是如此呢？</p>
<p>一個冬天的晚上，雪已舖着薄薄的一層，黃達這努力的孩子，匆匆地跑進學校來上課，他的傘子裏漏出一段殘餘的麵包，同學都嘲弄他。第一節退課之後，沙濾水龍頭的旁邊，兀然站着這一個苦學生，把麵包浸入沙濾中而完成他唯一的一頓晚餐。</p>
<p>後來據其他學生的報告，黃達的殘餘麵包是高厦後門口的旁邊拾來的，好容易得到大菜司務的許可，便常常到那處去收拾一些殘屑作爲晚餐之用。那風乾而硬化的程度，自然不能不用自來水來浸一浸了。道孩子的不幸，連一頓飯也這樣麼？</p>
<p>一張從貧民窟地址寄來的明片，上面寫道：</p>
<p>「學生黃達半月來天天從下午三點鐘奉母命去領饅頭，一直要等到六點鐘才得到兩個小饅頭，所以不能來上課，先生請原諒，我不知道領到什麼時候才有書讀？兩個小饅頭像茶杯一樣大，吃是吃不飽的，母親說要我領來我祇得去領，其實，無濟於肚子的。…………」</p>

<p>每逢主日，我們禱吿說，「願主的國降臨！」有何意思？意思就是說，有這麼一個世界，其中的痛苦疾病極少。其中的婦女受尊敬，兒童不被人忘記，老人不被人丟棄；於中人的價値比機器貴重，人的生命比利益高貴。換一句話也可以說有這麼一個社會，其中的目標不在你能賺進多少，乃在你能施捨多少，服務多少。我們是上帝的兒女，負有彼比帮助的責任。設使我們的宗教能多多注重生活，我們眞把自己所信仰的付諸實行，諸位想，我們社會上，世界上，還有這樣多的人頻於餓死嗎？記得在美國參觀一處佈置十分精美的避暑山莊：看護穿了美麗制服，服事許多頭狗，狗住的房子，比我盼望購置的好的多多，期中有跳舞室，寢室，各寫上各的名字，牠們食物精美，刷毛洗澡有定時，私用醫生，廚子，墓地等無不全備。而在相距不遠的所在，有許多貧民窟，房子不適用，衛生設備毫無。這一幅人不如狗的圖實，教我看了，眞覺熱血沸騰了，耶穌不是說過，「這些事你旣作在這弟兄中最小的一個身上，便是作在我的身上了？」他爲人犧牲一切，每日在民間帮助人使人生更良善，高貴，淸潔。他的宗教是日常的服務和犧牲。他藉着行事使已得快樂，使人得平安。我們做耶穌的信徒，也得這樣行。（完）</p>

<h3 id="c118">美總統羅斯福提議　攝製哥倫布影片　聘劉別謙導演 <a href="#c118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>— 林公</p>
<p>美國有一個時期，却是盛行歷史影片，好萊塢的八大公司，曾以全力搜集歷史故事，拍攝影片，一方面固然是迎合觀衆的心理，同時假使一方面以某國歷史作題材而攝成的影片，倘使有發揚某國偉大處的地方，照例該國要撥出巨額獎金給公司，爲了兩方面皆能得到利益，所以每一個製片商，曾一度耗盡了不知多少心血化在歷史影片上面。一九三七年後，電影事業突然有個轉變，觀衆的眼光都集中在戰事和歌舞片上，歷史影片就喪失了固有的地位。</p>
<p>然而有幾個導演因爲劇本的限制，也時時有拍攝歷史片的餘音，猶如最近公映的大概有「十字軍英雄記」「玫瑰戰爭」「拿破崙血戰史」「夏伯陽」「叛艦喋血記」「英烈傳」「雙城記「太陽的」「事」「鐵蹄情淚」等片，都是歷史影片不朽的作品，一時賣座的驚人，確實已超過任何性質的影片，而且在世界各國，同樣地都受着羣衆的擁戴。所以好萊塢有許多導演，仍舊堅持主張增加拍攝歷史影片，可是爲了製片商眼光的薄弱，現在在世界影壇上保持拍攝歷史片的，祇有大導演劉別謙一個人了。</p>
<p>從美國機關報路易士銀花雜誌上，最近發表了一段新聞，就是美總統羅斯福將請大導演劉別謙担任拍攝一部哥倫布發現新大陸的影片，現美總統已核准撥給二百萬美金的攝製費，倘使導演成績能得到優越的結果，另有一百萬美金的獎金，當然在美總統的聘請之下，那有不答應的呢。可是米高梅和派拉蒙公司因爲在今年秋季，將請劉別謙導演兩部歷史片，因此爲了本身營業計，聞已向美政府請求該片拍攝時間，以五個月爲限，預料大致不會發生問題，可以順利地解決了。不過最近拍攝歷史片人材的缺乏，已是無可異議的事實。因此在簽訂台同的時候，附帶拖上了埃洛爾茀林和茀特立馬區兩人也加入，酬金每人都是三十萬美金，據說關於埃洛林和茀特兩人自己的公司裏，也能够答應讓他們到外面去攝片，大的開始攝製的日期，就在最近期間吧。</p>

<p>孤島的製片風氣，自轉移到攝製古裝片以來，正如雨後春筍，在漫無止境的生產着，這對於古裝片的發展可說是一個絕大的成功，然因古裝太充斥於各影院，不免會使人忘却牠的寓意，感不到直接的痛癢，所以應啊再變換一次風氣的可能，而現在這孤島中一些不淸醒的朋友，也正可利用影片來喚醒一下。</p>
<p>目今投機實在太猖在了，把各種物品抬到了最高價。這裏最先要喚醒的人便是投機者，而我以爲這倒很可以把茅盾先生的子夜來排演一下的。此外更希望多有一些文藝片的演出，這對一般學生是最適宜的「銀后榮譽　」獻贈，至李綺年照片則由上海郵政信箱二〇二〇號影迷服務社代贈</p>

<p>— 企華</p>
<p>「人海寃魂是　齣家庭大悲劇，但是這悲劇是潛伏性的，而不是暴露的，所以，它或許不及「寒夜琴挑」那樣容易激動觀衆，可是在另一方面，那些枝枝節節的畫面，正是處處在暴露那家庭悲劇的原因，看到保雜茂尼的孩子在浴缸中唱着那支歌的時候，在感動之外，或許也能使每一個觀衆回憶到遭悲劇造成的原因，及反省到自己。</p>
<p>夫婦間的不睦，有的是表面的，有的是潛伏的，愛德門戈亭在日常生活中告訴我們保羅茂尼和他妻子之間的感悄是怎樣？他的愛護琴白蘭茵又怎樣？他沒有浪費一個畫面，而將這許多累積的原因，到一個適當的時候暴發起來，祇要我們並不感到沉悶，就是他成功的地方。</p>
<p>保羅茂尼在這個戲中，吿訴我們他實在是一個全能的演員。琴白蘭茵及飾保羅妻子的茀維蘭洛勃蓀也都精湛。</p>

Tonight, Japanese troops are advancing inland along two routes to Sili, not far from the Macau-Shiqi highway. Several villages have been set on fire by the Japanese and are burning fiercely. (Reuters, 5th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Guilin: At the Provincial Government Memorial Week on the 4th, Chairman Huang reported on his inspection of Binyang, stating that when the Japanese captured Binyang, the alarm was still sounding. The fleeing civilians left everything at home except for their personal belongings, and as a result, everything was burned by the Japanese. At that time, some civilians in air-raid shelters were unaware that the Japanese troops had arrived. When they heard heavy gunfire, they fled, but were strafed by Japanese machine guns and suffered severe injuries. Since the Japanese withdrawal, refugees have been returning successively, but the city has been reduced to rubble, with only 20-30% of the buildings intact. Regarding relief efforts, in addition to the Department of Civil Affairs sending personnel with funds for relief, special commissioners have been dispatched by the Pacification Headquarters and the Provincial Government to Shanglin, Wuming, and Binyang to handle loans, build sheds, provide relief to child refugees, purchase plowing cattle and rice seeds for epidemic prevention, and introduce refugees to work, organizing righteous people and strong young men into transportation teams, etc., so that refugees can engage in production after their return. Regarding the living conditions of civil servants, due to the significant responsibilities of the chiefs, it has been decided to increase salaries, dividing them into eight levels, with the lowest at 100 yuan per month and the highest at 170 yuan. Furthermore, the living expenses of township and village heads, deputy village/street heads, and national school teachers will be increased by 50 catties of grain per month, as decided by the Pinggui county heads' meeting, and each county will implement this immediately.

<h3 id="e14">No Doubt About British Policy Towards China <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>"Then, is British policy towards China 1,800 miles away from the National Government of China?" "No!" This was the exchange between Labour MP Davison and Foreign Office official Butler in the British House of Commons yesterday. In response to current doubts, they used exquisite language to seek accurate explanations, ultimately obtaining a solemn declaration. The words were simple, the meaning clear, and filled with passion and integrity. Those near and far who hear it will surely be drawn to it. Chongqing is 1,800 miles away from Shanghai. The National Government of China is in Chongqing. Although British Ambassador to China Sir Archibald Clark Kerr has recently stayed in Chongqing, the embassy is in Shanghai. For the past thirty months, the international impression of Shanghai has been the general public's perception of Shanghai. They feel it is complicated and filled with murky atmosphere; they feel it is a source of conspiracy and a den of all evils; it is not only beyond the control of the National Government's decrees and authority, but what it expresses and brews often runs counter to the interests of the Chinese nation-state government. It is certainly not the capital of the country where envoys should reside, nor is it a place where envoys should linger. If policy towards China is based on Shanghai, then it is indeed 1,800 miles away from the National Government! Now, Davison raised his concerns, and Butler refuted them.</p>
<p>Since China resolutely resisted Japan and launched military operations, the various forms of support that Britain has provided to China are difficult to quantify in terms of their great value. This is not only understood by both Chinese and British officials and the public, but also resented by Japan and recognized by the world. However, the tariff concessions and compromises made earlier, the tolerance and concessions in the Tokyo negotiations later, and the frequent rumors of the loss of silver in Tianjin all showed signs of weakness in every dispute. This contradicted the actual support for China and violated the treaty rights in China. The stated policy was one thing, but the actions were weak. This has repeatedly caused unease and resentment among the Chinese and British public. Moreover, at a time when Japan wants to stop but cannot, and is pursuing both diplomatic and political offensives, it uses smoke to cover up its attempts to sow discord and division, and uses propaganda to spread its confusing and misleading tactics. Therefore, it tries every possible way to show people that Shanghai is not only beyond the National Government's remote control from Chongqing, but is also completely under Japanese control and stands as a base point in opposition to Chongqing, causing British Members of Parliament to have concerns about the British government's policy towards China, like Davison. Is this a success of the Japanese in terms of tactics? Or a failure of the British authorities in terms of sincerity?</p>
<p>We do not hesitate to say that there is a vast difference between our past and present views of the British government. To put it bluntly: in the past, we not only worried and doubted, but were also indignant, believing that if China failed to resist Japan, at the very least, Britain's interests in the East would be sacrificed, not only because of the situation, but also because of a willingness to promote it. Since it went to war with Germany and up to now, our views of Britain not only no longer worry and doubt, but also sympathize. This is not because we hate Germany more, but because we sympathize with the difficulties Britain faces in dealing with the environment, and we sympathize with the British authorities' credit and glory in fulfilling their international treaty obligations. We sympathize with the various arguments promoted by key British officials regarding the war. However, its difficulties may indeed increase its possibility of colluding with or even succumbing to violence in the Far East; especially if Britain finds itself at a disadvantage in the European war, or even strives to preserve its position in Europe and has to abandon its interests and withdraw from the Far East. Then this possibility will become more active and concrete. However, precisely because of the European war, we absolutely cannot imagine that the British authorities would disregard driving their people, disregarding gambling their national destiny, using gold and blood to maintain their credibility and glory in the balance of power in Europe and in national history, while in the Far East, without having to bet gold and blood, they would carelessly sacrifice it to a moment of cowardice and weakness. We absolutely cannot imagine that the arguments promoted by the British about resisting aggression, maintaining order, and loving democracy, freedom, justice, would be disproved by their perfunctory compromises in the Far East as false and deceptive rhetoric. We also absolutely cannot imagine that wartime Britain, by selling out China in the Pacific, would go against the United States, increasing the responsibilities and threats faced by the United States in the Pacific, and still be able to obtain full support from the United States in the Atlantic as they ideally wanted. Therefore, although the European war has had some unfavorable impact on China's resistance, we earnestly hope that Britain, France, Germany, and the Soviet Union will resolve their disputes as soon as possible and return to good relations. However, all the past concerns about British policy towards China have now completely disappeared. In short, if China does not continue to resist Japan, then Britain's policy towards China during China's resistance will naturally be abandoned, as exemplified by Britain's attitude towards the Abyssinian problem. If Britain abandons its stated policy towards China while China continues to resist Japan, the fact will be a withdrawal from the Far East, and the meaning will be a defeat without fighting against Japan. This impact will weaken foreign aid and strengthen the enemy's gains from foreign aid. Looking at Germany's attempt to court the Soviet Union and Japan, persuading Japan to end its invasion of China, the key is clear. As a diplomatic official, Butler answered Davison's concerns with a resounding "No!" His words were sonorous and resonant, and there was a reason for it.</p>

<p>Hong Kong: Cai Yuanpei, a member of the Central Supervisory Committee, felt slightly unwell on the morning of the 5th and was sent to the Sanatorium &amp; Hospital for treatment. He passed away at 9:45 AM, at the age of 74. Wu Tiecheng, a member of the committee, is presiding over Cai's funeral. (5th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing: Chairman Chiang recently sent a condolence telegram to the family of Mr. Cai Jiemin, which read: "To Madam Cai and Brother Wuji in Hong Kong, it is with great shock that I learned of Mr. Jiemin's passing. The passing of an elder statesman is deeply mourned. I hope you will restrain your grief and carry on his legacy to comfort his spirit. I send this telegram of condolences, Chiang Kai-shek." 微, (5th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Always Thinking of National Affairs</p>
<p>A reporter from the Chongqing Central News Agency heard that Mr. Cai Jiemin, President of the Academia Sinica, passed away at his residence in Hong Kong on the morning of the 5th and immediately visited Qian Hong, Director-General of the Academia Sinica, to inquire about the details. Qian Hong made the following statement: Mr. Cai's health had not recovered since his illness in 1938. However, he still presided over or participated in the affairs of the Academia Sinica and major national affairs, never complaining of fatigue. After the "July 7th Incident," the southeastern provinces successively fell, and the Academia Sinica moved inland along with the government agencies. Mr. Cai wanted to continue the relocation when he was in Hong Kong in 1937, but due to his weakened condition after his illness, he was unable to endure the long journey and hardships, and he temporarily stayed in Hong Kong for recuperation at the doctor's and family's advice. Last March, the Council of the Academia Sinica held a meeting in Kunming, and Mr. Cai originally planned to attend despite his illness, but was temporarily stopped by the doctor. Although Mr. Cai was unable to go to the mainland in person, he was still very concerned about the affairs of the Academia Sinica and gave remote instructions whenever there were important matters. In the past, the various institutes of the Academia Sinica in Nanjing and Shanghai made great contributions and achieved remarkable results. After the War of Resistance, the various institutes were able to resume work in a short period of time despite being displaced and relocated. This was all due to the leadership and spiritual inspiration of Mr. Cai. As for the cause of his illness, although it was said that he was old and weak, his usual concern for national affairs and his indignation towards the Japanese army were the greatest reasons. A few months ago, he published the "Manjianghong 抗戰歌 (Resistance Song)," and his patriotism was evident in his words. However, the old man's body became increasingly weak as a result. In the summer of the year before last, he fainted once in the bathroom, but fortunately, the rescue was handled properly, and he did not suffer a major setback. It is said that this time, he fell after getting out of bed early in the morning three days ago, vomited blood, and lost consciousness. Although many Western doctors were called to give him injections and treatment, they could not save him. He passed away at 9:45 AM on the morning of the 5th. Mr. Cai has contributed to the Party and the country, especially in presiding over Peking University and the Academia Sinica. He has made great contributions to our country's education and scholarship. According to the organizational law of the Academia Sinica, the successor to the President of the Academia Sinica should be elected by the Council at a meeting, and three candidates should be presented to the National Government for selection and appointment. The current Council was originally scheduled to meet in Chongqing on March 22, and we hope that a successor will be appointed as soon as possible to avoid any disruption to the affairs of the Academia Sinica.

<p>Dedicated to Education Throughout His Life</p>
<p>Chongqing: Cai Yuanpei, courtesy name Heqing, sobriquet Jiemin, was born in Shaoxing, Zhejiang. He was a former Qing Dynasty scholar. He served as the supervisor of the Shaoxing Chinese-Western School and a teacher at Nanyang Public School. He founded the Patriotic Girls' School, the Chinese Education Association, and the Patriotic Society, and joined the Tongmenghui (Revolutionary Alliance). He studied in Germany. Five years before the founding of the Republic of China, he lived in Berlin for a year. He then studied philosophy, literature, the history of civilization, anthropology, experimental psychology, and aesthetics at the University of Leipzig for three years. After the Xinhai Revolution, he returned to China and served as the Minister of Education of the Nanjing Provisional Government. During his tenure as Minister of Education, he established a Department of Social Education in addition to the Departments of General Education and Vocational Education. He resigned in the summer of the first year of the Republic of China and returned to the University of Leipzig to teach and conduct research at the World History of Civilization Institute for two years. He returned to China in the summer of that year and went to Europe again in the autumn, living in Paris for a year. When the European war began, he moved to southwestern France and helped Li Shizeng and others run the Franco-Chinese Education Association and organize the Hua Fa Education Association. In 1916, he returned to China and served as the President of Peking University, taking office in January of the following year. He reformed the school administration, revised the curriculum, and hired accomplished scholars to serve as professors. The academic atmosphere changed greatly, and Peking University became a source of new ideas. In 1919, the May Fourth Movement occurred. More than ten students from Peking University were arrested. Cai was angry at the government's inadequate handling of the students and left Beijing on May 9. After being persuaded to stay, he returned to school in September. In October of the ninth year, he went to France to plan the University of Lyon. He returned to China in the autumn of the following year. He resigned in January of the twelfth year and traveled to France. He recommended Jiang Menglin as his successor as president. In 1926, he was elected as a member of the Second Central Supervisory Committee and has been re-elected ever since. He also served as the Chancellor of the University Council and a member of the National Government Committee. He has been the President of the Academia Sinica since 1929. (5th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Wu Wang and Others Form Funeral Committee</p>
<p>Hong Kong: The body of Mr. Cai Jiemin was moved to the Fulu Shou Funeral Home on the afternoon of the 5th. After his eldest son, Wuji, arrives in Hong Kong, the minor encoffining is scheduled for 3:00 PM on the 7th. According to Wang Yunwu, Cai's illness was caused by a fall at his Kowloon residence on the morning of the 3rd, which resulted in a mouthful of blood, followed by blood in his stool. He was immediately treated by a doctor, and due to his advanced age, he was sent to the Sanatorium &amp; Hospital. His condition was still good on the way. After being admitted to the hospital, he was injected with hemostatic agents and glucose, and his spirits improved slightly. At 9:00 PM on the 4th, his condition worsened. Five Chinese and Western doctors were consulted, and it was determined that he had a gastric hemorrhage. An emergency blood transfusion was performed, which had a remarkable effect. It was originally scheduled to continue the blood transfusion on the 5th, but his condition changed again at 8:00 AM on the 5th. Despite emergency treatment, he passed away at 9:45 AM. Madam Cai, Zhou Jun, his daughter, Ruian, and his sons, Huaixin and Yingduo, were all by his side. The youngest is only eleven years old. His second son, Berlin, is currently in France. Mr. Cai was 74 years old. He dedicated his life to revolution and educational and academic careers. His morality and writing were admired by the world. His sudden death shocked and grieved all who heard of it. Cai's friends Wu Tiecheng, Wang Yunwu, Ye Gongchao, and others formed a funeral committee to preside over the funeral. (5th Dispatch)</p>

<p>Chongqing: British leftist leader Sir Stafford Cripps recently had interesting talks with leaders of the Chinese government in Chongqing and with leaders of the Soviet Union in Moscow. He has just returned from far western China after flying to Xinjiang and is now flying to Hong Kong today, en route to Shanghai. He used the Sino-Soviet Aviation Business between England and China, starting from Chongqing and flying directly to Moscow via Xinjiang. In fact, Sir Stafford and his secretary are the first ones to do that. When Sir Stafford and his group returned to Chongqing, they were unable to fly, so they traveled by car across northern Xinjiang along the important highway connecting China and the Soviet Union, a journey of nearly a thousand miles. Sir Stafford stayed in Moscow for thirty-six hours, meeting with several Soviet government officials, "aiming to obtain a more detailed explanation of the Soviet Union's policies on international events," but Sir Stafford stressed that his trip was entirely private in nature. According to him, rumors that the Soviet Union occupied or managed Xinjiang were inaccurate. He saw no evidence of Soviet occupation or management in any place he visited. He did not visit the ailing provincial chairman in Xinjiang, but he did have talks with senior officials of the province. Although Xinjiang maintains extremely friendly relations with the Soviet Union, and the Soviet Union provides a great deal of technical assistance to the development of Xinjiang, the provincial chairman and officials firmly maintain that the province is part of China and very much hope that China will win the war against Japan. The past disputes between Muslims and Chinese have been resolved. The authorities grant complete civil and religious equality to all ethnic groups, just like the White Russians, who now have the same rights as Chinese citizens. Xinjiang is currently engaged in its first three-year plan to develop light industry, education, and transportation. (Reuters, 5th Dispatch)</p>

<p>Tokyo – A large-scale wood pulp manufacturing plant will soon be established in "Manchukuo" with a capital of 40 million Japanese yen, to exploit the vast pulpwood resources in the Hinggan Mountains and develop the wood pulp manufacturing industry. The undertaking is led by "Kanegafuchi Spinning Co., Ltd.," a major Japanese cotton textile company. The detailed plan has been finalized through consultations between the "Manchukuo" authorities and the company. Japan's "Oji Paper Co., Ltd." and a certain rayon and fiber manufacturer in the country are also participating in the project. This is another step forward in the operation of Japanese trusts in "Manchuria." The site for the new factory has long been surveyed, but there has been a slight delay due to incomplete equipment. It is estimated that after its establishment, it will produce 60,000 tons of wood pulp annually, of which 40,000 tons will be used for the rayon industry and 20,000 tons will be used for paper production.

<h3 id="e28">Under Principles of International Law, Britain and France Block German Coal Shipments to Italy, Aiming to Strike Germany and Achieve Victory, Italian Coal Ships Attempt to Sail Out of Blockade Zone <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>London – Economic Warfare Minister Cross stated in the House of Commons this afternoon that any ships currently carrying German coal from Rotterdam under the flag of a neutral country will be detained. When asked whether any German coal was being transported to Italy on Italian ships from Rotterdam, Cross replied that it had now ended. (Reuters, 5th)</p>
<p>Rotterdam – It is expected that more Italian coal ships will set sail today, continuing to transport German coal to Italy, in order to avoid the British blockade. Six coal ships set sail from here yesterday. (Reuters, 5th)</p>
<p>London "The Times" diplomatic correspondent, discussing the Central Powers' decision to prevent German coal from being shipped to Italy by sea, and Italy's protests against this, stated that Britain's attitude is that all decisions are in accordance with international law. The British government's principles underlying all its actions, and its established plan for achieving victory, cannot be altered by foreign protests. The British government, to the best of its ability, seeks to alleviate the inconvenience and annoyance felt by neutral and non-belligerent countries, and treats everyone equally, seeking to make distinctions. When neutral countries have voiced grievances, the British government has always handled such issues with fairness and compassion, and made small adjustments from time to time. Italy's attitude is neither unjust nor unfriendly, but preventing German coal from being exported is not intended to make things difficult for Italy, but only to strike at Germany. When the British government decided to prevent the export of German products last September, it notified the Italian government, stating that Britain would sooner or later prevent Italy from purchasing and transporting German coal. The British government was well aware that a sudden ban would affect Italian industry, so it gave three months' notice. At the same time, the trade negotiations between the two countries, which had begun last year, were strengthened in order to allow British coal to be transported to Italy in exchange for certain Italian heavy industrial products. These negotiations stalled three or four weeks ago on this point. The British government had hoped to remove the difficulties, but seeing no movement from the Italian side, the order to prevent the export of German coal, which had long been anticipated, came into effect. (Reuters, 5th)</p>
<p>Amsterdam – According to news received here, the British wartime economy formally declared that the British blockade of German coal shipments to Italy has not been delayed. Rumors that the British government had allowed ships to load German coal to Italy are not consistent with the facts. "Ships that departed from port to load German coal before midnight on March 3 will be intercepted in accordance with the announced order." According to shipping industry sources, fourteen Italian ships currently anchored in Rotterdam have received orders to sail, six of which are fully loaded with German coal and sailed yesterday. The attitude of the British side towards them, and future developments, are of great concern here. (Haitong News Agency, 5th)</p>
<p>Amsterdam – The Italian coal ships, after leaving Rotterdam on the 2nd of this month, were once recalled by the shipowners. Today, the Italian railway bureau in Rotterdam received a telegram from Rome, ordering the coal ships to resume their voyage yesterday. People here believe that the British and Italian sides have not yet reached an agreement on the coal transportation issue. Italy's order for the coal ships to sail as usual is probably a test of Britain's attitude. (Haitong News Agency, 5th)</p>
<p>A correspondent from the "Swedish Daily News" in Berlin reports that the German government is now eagerly awaiting news of how Britain will deal with the Italian ships carrying German coal from Rotterdam back to Italy yesterday, as they pass through the British blockade zone. Berlin views the Italian ships' sailing out in defiance of the Central Powers' ban as a test of Britain's attitude. If the British navy does not detain these ships, it will be tantamount to acknowledging the illegitimacy of the blockade. Berlin sees the Italian government's decision to do this as proof that Italy is prepared to accept the consequences of this action. However, Berlin political circles do not believe that a serious conflict will occur if Britain intercepts the Italian ships, but they believe that the Italian ships' courageous venture across the British blockade zone is sufficient to indicate that Italy has decided to join the German side as its final plan. Berlin still remembers that when the League of Nations imposed sanctions on Italy over the Abyssinian issue, Italy used German coal instead of British coal. Now that the transport of German coal to France has ended, Germany, if it has enough trains available for railway transportation, believes that it can supply Italy's needs with a large amount of coal. (Reuters, 5th)</p>
<p>Rome – Regarding Britain's decision to detain German coal shipments destined for Italy, Italy's protest to Britain has recently been published by various newspapers, all with headlines such as "Italy's Wording is Clear and Firm," but without commentary. Foreign observers here say that Italy's protest is not limited to Britain's detention of German coal, but also protests against the principle of blockade and inspection. It is noteworthy that Italy's protest letter stated that the inspection methods contradict international law, but it did not mention the reason why Britain adopted the inspection methods, namely Germany's violation of international law. In other words, Germany's method of warfare is the cause, and Britain's measures are the effect. Italy only speaks of the effect without mentioning the cause, which is not fair. In addition, Italy strongly states that Britain's inspection methods have harmed non-belligerent countries, but the damage caused by German mines, submarines, and aircraft to the shipping of neutral countries is even greater, and Italy ignores it. In short, the British and French sides may be able to find a way to make Italy's required amount of coal certain, but not make them cancel the inspection. Whether Italy's protest is due to its reputation or to reaffirm German-Italian cooperation is unknown, but it is safe to say that Germany will be pleased with it. (Havas, 4th)</p>

<p>Paris – Regarding the blockade policy implemented by Britain and France, in addition to the Italian government's protest to Britain, according to news from Tokyo, Japan also feels uneasy about the possibility of this inspection method being extended outside the port of Vladivostok. It is reported that when the Japanese and French governments held talks on the Japanese aircraft bombing of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway, this issue was involved. However, those in charge here all say that the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway is the only railway line for trade between European and American countries and China. Since the Japanese government disregards everything and demands that it be cut off, we will also make the same request for the Siberian Railway, because Germany can transport soybeans and other goods from that route. However, this request is completely contrary to current international law, so Britain and France have absolutely no intention of taking this step. As for blockading goods destined for Germany via the port of Vladivostok at sea, there is nothing to criticize. In fact, Britain and France have not yet taken any action in this regard, but Japan has already felt uneasy. Therefore, all parties concerned should also study this issue. (Havas, 4th)</p>

<h3 id="e31">British Chancellor Announces Issuance of War Bonds, Limited to £300 Million, Subscription to Begin on the 12th of This Month <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>London – Chancellor of the Exchequer Simon announced in the House of Commons this afternoon that the new war bonds are limited to £300 million, with a term of 15 to 19 years and an interest rate of 3%, received at face value. Subscription will begin on the 12th of this month and close the next day. The Chancellor said that the country's huge expenditures are now supported by the increased taxes introduced last September, the increased issuance of treasury bills, and the increasing revenue from the savings campaign since last November. The government's delay in announcing the appeal to the public to subscribe to a large amount of bonds was because it had to wait for the market to be able to issue bonds. Now the time is ripe. Since the outbreak of the war, all borrowing has been short-term, but the new bonds will have a term of 15 to 19 years. The government is adhering to the policy of borrowing at the lowest possible interest rate, so the interest rate on the new bonds is set at 3%, but it is also appropriate from the investor's point of view. The bonds are scheduled to be repaid on October 15, 1959, but the Treasury reserves the right to repay all or part of them at any time after October 14, 1955, with three months' notice. Therefore, the bonds are intended to be named "3% War Bonds of 1955-59," limited to £300 million. The amount of money the government needs to borrow in the coming year will be much greater than this, but limiting the amount of the first issuance is beneficial to the Treasury from several perspectives, and is in line with those who lend. All subscribers must pay one-tenth at the time of subscription, and the remainder on April 15. Those who subscribe who do not reside in the United Kingdom are exempt from the bond tax, similar to the situation of subscribing to several war bonds during the last war. Post offices and national savings banks will all issue them on behalf of the government. All those who subscribe at these two locations must subscribe for at least £10 and no more than £1,000. This is to give subscribers the opportunity to use their savings to purchase new war bonds with a longer term than savings bonds and national defense bonds. (Reuters, 5th)</p>

<p>London – A spokesman for the Overseas Trade Department said here today that although Britain is at war, it is determined to maintain trade with overseas countries to the fullest extent possible. In the short period after the outbreak of the war, various countries will inevitably experience uncertainty and hesitation, but as far as Britain is concerned, this stage has definitely passed. Its manufacturers and traders are ready to meet the needs of overseas customers at any time. The government is also well aware that the maintenance of export trade is of great importance to the smooth progress of the war, so it has repeatedly declared that it is willing to promote it within its power. Although the government has to adopt a licensing system for certain exports to strengthen control, most ordinary exports are still unaffected. Even for exports that require a license, all the initial delays in issuing licenses have now been completely reformed. Although war inevitably causes difficulties and instability from time to time, Britain's traditional advantage at sea will continue to protect all kinds of goods entering and leaving its ports. We are quite confident about the prospect of maintaining the exchange of goods with various countries during the war, just as in peacetime. As for certain goods being included in the prohibited list, it does not mean that they are prohibited from being exported from Britain, but that they cannot be exported without a license. The spokesman concluded that if difficulties arise in obtaining goods from the Central Powers, British commercial, diplomatic, and consular officials stationed overseas are ready to investigate and, if necessary, report to the Department of Trade for a solution.

<p>London – At a meeting of the House of Commons last night, a member asked whether the British government had taken sufficient steps to safeguard Britain's trading position in China after the end of the war. Under-Secretary Butler replied that the British Ambassador spends a lot of time in Chongqing, and that there is a permanent office of the Embassy there. When the British Ambassador is in Shanghai or elsewhere, he will contact the Chinese government on all matters relating to British trade interests. Although the British Embassy is 1,800 miles away from the Chinese government, when the British Ambassador is not in Chongqing, there are other fully qualified personnel to conduct consultations with the Chinese government.

(Reuters, 5th)</p>
<p>Washington – Regarding Undersecretary of State Welles's visit to Europe, people here have recently commented that the true value of this trip depends on how President Roosevelt uses it after Welles returns home and submits a detailed report to the President. Diplomatic circles, because they do not know the details of Welles's talks with the German authorities, believe that it is not possible to judge whether he has gained anything, but they believe that he has obtained various conveniences to inquire about the intentions of the German authorities and the "official goals" of the country's war. It is expected that when Welles goes to London and Paris, the British and French authorities will also give him the same convenience, so that he can submit a very detailed report to President Roosevelt. However, observers say that, based on the information currently available, it can be seen that the goals of the belligerent parties are completely different and there is no room for reconciliation. Therefore, President Roosevelt may not be able to do anything. (Havas, 5th)</p>

As the newspaper said, in order to completely eliminate the danger of France being threatened by Germany, Germany must be reduced to the status of a second-rate power. It can be seen that the so-called "United States of Europe" plan is nothing more than a means for Britain and France to achieve the goal of splitting Germany. (Haitong News Agency, 5th)</p>

<p>Stockholm. Foreign diplomatic circles here are closely watching the possibility of peace talks to end the war against Finland after the Soviet forces entered Viipuri, and the speculation about the Finnish political situation. It is generally believed that Finland's domestic political situation is at least as important as the war situation. Judging from the current situation, not only do the Germans want to see peace in Finland again, but so do the people of the Scandinavian Peninsula. However, it is believed that Finnish General Mannerheim and the army leaders will absolutely reject any proposals for peace on terms they consider unsatisfactory. (Reuters, 5th)</p>
<p>Bern. The "Ticino Post" correspondent in Stockholm cabled that in recent days, rumors about mediating the Soviet-Finnish war have been rampant. The governments of the Scandinavian Peninsula are very active diplomatically. It is said that relevant parties have proposed peace proposals to both the Finnish and Soviet governments. The main principle is that the Soviet Union recognizes Finland's independent sovereignty and the legitimate government led by Tanner, while forcing the "puppet government" led by Kuusinen to merge into the Helsinki government. Then the Finnish government would cede some territory to the Soviet Union as a military base. Diplomatic sources have not yet been able to confirm whether this is true. (Havas, 5th)</p>

<p>Amsterdam. The increasing number of attacks on Dutch ships by German aircraft has caused alarm in the Netherlands. It is generally believed that Germany's methods of dealing with neutral country ships have now entered a new and more serious stage. According to Dutch shipping sources, Germany clearly regards the simple fact of sailing at sea as a crime that should be attacked. Last Sunday, German Naval Commander-in-Chief Raeder broadcast a warning, saying that unless Britain abandons its current methods, neutral country ships in the war zone will not receive real protection. Today, newspapers here are filled with news of yesterday's attack on Dutch ships, and there are detailed reports of the tragedy of the sinking of the Dutch small coastal ship "Aelzina" by a bomb, with the captain and engineer killed. The "Rotterdam Daily," which often reflects the views of the Dutch government, exceptionally published an editorial this morning detailing Germany's new strategy, saying that Germany's war methods violate the rights of neutral country shipping and have caused the deepest resentment. As for the nationality of the aircraft attacking neutral country merchant ships, there is no doubt, as the German war bulletin has repeatedly mentioned the activities of the German air force in the North Sea in the past week, while Britain has never been heard to attack neutral country ships. It is expected that the Dutch government will accurately determine the nationality of the attacking aircraft as soon as possible, and then file a serious protest with the responsible parties and demand a satisfactory reply.

After drifting at sea for 36 hours, they finally landed at a port on the northeast coast of England. One of them was injured. The ship's captain and engineer were killed by the blast.

<p>London. A Havas reporter recently visited several British naval bases and interviewed British naval officials to discuss the naval war situation in the past six months. It was learned that in the first two weeks after the outbreak of the European war, German submarines sank a total of 130,985 tons of British and French merchant ships. Subsequently, Britain and France implemented escort measures, and the number of merchant ships sunk was greatly reduced. The tonnage sunk in November was only one-third of that in September. At the same time, German submarines were repeatedly sunk by British and French warships or aircraft, and the number of losses has exceeded one-quarter of the total tonnage. When Germany decided on the European war, it adopted unlimited submarine warfare methods, inflicting heavy blows on Britain and France. A total of 2,561,000 tons of British and French merchant ships were sunk in ten months in 1918. At present, in the first five months of the war, German submarines and mines have sunk less than 500,000 tons of British and French merchant ships, which is vastly different. The United Kingdom implemented a merchant ship escort system in 1918 and stepped up the construction of merchant ships so that those sunk by German submarines each month could be replenished. The British government is still implementing this method. On the other hand, the German Naval Department had 16 stopover stations along the coasts of Africa and the Americas during the last European war, but they no longer exist, so the German merchant fleet had to stop sailing overseas. As for the strength of the British Navy, in addition to the loss of the aircraft carrier "Courageous" and the battleship "Royal Oak," it has 11 battleships with displacements between 29,000 tons and 33,000 tons, 50 cruisers, 160 destroyers, 200 mine sweepers, and many auxiliary ships. As for the German Navy, the pocket battleship "Admiral Graf Spee" has already been sunk by itself, and the "Blücher" and many submarines have been lost. Only five battleships with a tonnage of between 14,000 tons and 26,000 tons remain. There are also two 40,000-ton battleships and five heavy cruisers under construction. The German Naval Department has adopted magnetic mines, sinking many British and French merchant ships, but Britain has coping methods for this new type of weapon and is improving them day by day. Since November of last year, the number of British and French merchant ships sunk by mines has been greatly reduced. Not only that, but the British coast from the Firth of Forth to the Shetland Islands has been laid with a mine net, as if building a maritime Maginot Line. (Havas, 5th)</p>
<p>London. According to the British Air Force authorities, in the past six months, 45 British aircraft have been shot down by the enemy, and Germany has lost 114 aircraft. Forty-three British Royal Air Force aircraft were lost when attacking German naval bases, ports, docks, and areas where mines were laid. The other two aircraft were shot down by the Germans while reconnaissance the Siegfried Line. The Germans lost 51 fighter planes. Forty-two German planes were destroyed by the British on the Western Front and Heligoland. Fifty-nine were shot down by the British when attacking the east coast of England. (United Press, 5th)</p>
<h3 id="e51">Results of Invasion; Japan's Raw Materials Scarce; Large Exports to China Not a Good Phenomenon; Business and Industry Deeply Concerned and Demand Restrictions <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo. The increasing exports of Japanese goods to the Asian continent are causing deep concern among the country's business and industry circles. Many members of parliament have also raised questions in parliament, saying that this kind of "economic and material loss" is very dangerous, and the government authorities urgently need to intervene. According to statistics released by the Ministry of Finance, Japan's trade surplus with the Asian continent was 397,000,000 yen in 1937, 617,000,000 yen in 1938, and 1,094,000,000 yen in 1939. Although this is due to the needs of the Japanese military operations and the establishment of industries in China and "Manchukuo," the Japanese business and industry circles still believe that it is necessary to impose restrictions. There are two reasons for this: (1) There is a severe shortage of raw materials in Japan at this time, and it is not convenient to have such a large output; (2) The proper way to reorganize the East Asian group should be to have Chinese wealth flow into Japan, not to let it become the opposite phenomenon. According to the "Oriental Economist" magazine, the way to save this situation is to take the necessary measures in the financial field to suppress the soaring prices in China and "Manchukuo." The sharp rise in prices on the Asian continent is the main reason why Japanese goods are flowing into China and "Manchukuo." This is not only due to the pursuit of profit, but also because the currencies in the vast areas of the continent are linked to the yen. The rise in prices in China and "Manchukuo" has become a spiral. The rise began not in Japan but on the continent. The Japanese authorities have taken strong measures to control prices domestically. Even if prices have not been stopped from rising, the upward trend has been slowed down. "Manchukuo" has also taken similar measures, but they have not been effective. The rise in prices in North and Central China has not been curbed in reality. Compared with 1939 and 1936, the percentage increase in wholesale prices is as follows:</p>
<p>Looking at the table above, although the situation in Japan and "Manchukuo" is quite optimistic, the difference between the "controlled economic zone" (Tokyo and Changchun) and the "uncontrolled economic zone" (Tianjin and Shanghai) is so great that goods will naturally flow out. In addition, if the Japanese authorities want to restrict the country's exports to the Asian continent, there is an important fact that must be taken into account, that is, China and "Manchukuo" are difficult to be self-sufficient, and they are becoming increasingly dependent on Japanese goods. In the case of "Manchukuo," the volume of trade with Japan increased greatly in 1939. Since the outbreak of the European war, "Manchukuo" has not been able to import goods from European countries in practice. Whether consumers or producers, all who need goods must obtain them from Japan. In 1938, Japanese goods imported into "Manchukuo" accounted for 77.9% of total imports, and in 1939, it increased to 84.4%. As for the goods transported from "Manchukuo" to Japan, they accounted for 57.5% of total exports in 1938, and increased to 62.5% last year. Furthermore, in the case of North and Central China, due to the Sino-Japanese War, various goods in inland China that were normally sold in Tianjin and Shanghai were all blocked. Therefore, the need for Japanese goods is also increasing day by day. North China's economic institutions, which had connections with Central China during peacetime, are now relying on Japan on a large scale. (Havas, 4th)</p>
<h3 id="e52">Japanese Diet Member Saito to Be Expelled; Allegedly Planning to Run Again One Year After Being Removed <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo. Japanese Rikken Minseito Diet member Takao Saito told Japanese journalists today that he will be expelled from the House of Representatives tomorrow. He plans to run again one year after being removed. This move has been approved by his constituents. Saito refused to resign voluntarily because the House of Representatives would not allow him to explain his criticism of Prince Fumimaro Konoe. The "Asahi Shimbun" claims that three Rikken Minseito leaders will resign at the same time as Saito because they bear part of the responsibility for Saito's "slip of the tongue." (United Press)</p>
<p>Tokyo. Takao Saito, a veteran member of the Rikken Minseito party who is currently convalescing in Atami, today phoned the chairman of the House of Representatives Disciplinary Committee, saying that he has decided not to resign from his position as a member of the Diet due to his "slip of the tongue" in the Diet on February 2. The Disciplinary Committee will reconvene tomorrow afternoon to make a final decision on Saito's case. According to the "Asahi Shimbun," the Disciplinary Committee will unanimously agree to expel Saito from the Diet. The House of Representatives will hold a plenary session on March 7, prohibiting spectators, to listen to the report of the chairman of the Disciplinary Committee, debate the issue, and pass a judgment. It is reported that after the meeting, Speaker of the House of Representatives Koyama will announce Saito's expulsion, but this move has not yet resolved the Saito incident, as a few political parties are organizing a movement to attack the attitude of the Rikken Minseito party and the Speaker of the House of Representatives. At the same time, Saito is now likely to become a hero admired by the public. (Reuters, 5th)</p>

<h3 id="e54">America's Imminent Embargo Threatens Japan Severely: Desperate Search for Raw Materials Yields Dim Hope; U.S. Predicts No Policy Shift; Renowned American Journalist Steele's Observations from Shanghai after Leaving Japan <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>Steele, a Far East correspondent for the Chicago Daily News of the United States, recently arrived in Shanghai after spending six weeks in Japan. Yesterday, speaking to foreign journalists, he said that although the U.S.-Japan commercial treaty had been abolished, Japan's policies were unlikely to change. Japan, now facing the threat of an embargo due to the treaty's termination, like a dangerous sword hanging overhead, is making every effort to seek raw materials from other sources. However, whether these efforts will succeed remains highly doubtful.</p>
<p>Attempts to Develop New Markets: In order to compensate for the possible loss of its urgently needed imports, Japan is now planning to obtain these raw materials from other countries, has begun to increase domestic production, and consistently pursues its policy of developing new markets. It welcomes the dispatch of an economic mission from Argentina, hoping to obtain wool and other products in Argentina to meet its needs.</p>
<p>Hopes for Assistance from the Soviet Union: Japan also hopes to promote trade relations with the South Seas Islands. In this regard, Japan seeks to obtain iron supplies from Malaya and other countries to compensate for its loss of scrap iron from the United States. In addition, Japan is conducting trade negotiations with the Soviet Union, hoping that the Soviet Union will become another source of imports.</p>
<p>Increasingly Close Sino-Tibetan Relations: Before going to Japan, Steele visited the interior of China and spoke with the young child who is now the Fourteenth Dalai Lama of Tibet at the Kumbum Monastery in Qinghai (transliteration). According to Steele's account, the child had not yet been selected as the Dalai Lama at that time, but the monks told the reporter that the image seen in the sacred lake and other omens all indicated that the child had an excellent chance of being selected. He saw that the child was exceptionally intelligent and that his birthplace was within China's sphere of influence. This matter will certainly have significant implications for future political relations between China and Tibet.</p>
<h3 id="e55">Coal Briquettes Sold at Cost: Industry Willing to Continue, but Requests Lower Transportation Costs <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Machine-Made Coal Briquette Industry Association sent a letter to the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce yesterday, reporting on the cost-price sale of coal briquettes and requesting the Chamber to quickly negotiate a reduction in water transportation fees. It stated that the cost-price sale of coal briquettes had been successful. Except for the first day, when the Kunyuanxing Coal Shop at No. 21, due to the small number of poor people in the area, had 20 unsold out of the originally planned 40 loads of briquettes, all the briquettes were sold out every day for the next three days. However, it was noted that the planned amount of cost-price briquettes at No. 21 was originally 40 loads per day, but was reduced to 20 loads from the second day onwards. The remaining 20 loads were then reallocated to the Xieyuan Coal Shop at No. 274恺自邇 Road, which was responsible for selling them at cost price, and a 27th location was established. It was also noted that the Huachang Coal Shop at No. 7, originally scheduled to sell 40 loads of cost-price briquettes per day, found that the number of poor people in the area was insufficient, so Shanyi Taixing automatically increased the amount by 20 loads per day, for a total of 60 loads per day. However, all the factories belonging to our Association are very willing to continue to sell coal briquettes at cost price under the leadership of your Chamber in the future, even at a sacrifice. However, the soaring water transportation costs are related to the cost of production. We previously heard that Director Yu Qiaqing had agreed to find a way to reduce them, but to this day, there is no concrete news. It has been found that in recent days, due to the comparison between the cost of raw materials and the selling price, the factories have suffered huge losses, so some have already stopped production. We hope that your Chamber will relay our request to Director Yu Qiaqing to quickly find a way to reduce costs and speak on our behalf, so that we can escape business difficulties and ensure social stability.</p>
<p>Boiled Water Industry: The Shanghai Boiled Water Industry Association, in order to urgently seek a solution to the coal shortage, held a temporary general meeting of all members yesterday morning at 10:00 AM at the Ningbo Native Place Association on Yu Qiaqing Road. More than 500 members attended, and Kui Yanfang also attended to provide guidance. The members pledged to donate more than 1,000 yuan on the spot. Then, the discussion began on (1) How to solve the coal shortage problem of the industry. It was resolved that all members should go to the Association to complete the procedures from now on and continue to prepare a document with prominent figures in Shanghai to negotiate with the Kai'ao Mining Bureau for cheap supplies. (2) Comply with the Association's articles of association and stipulate the price of selling water in order to unify it. It was resolved to unanimously abide by the Association's articles of association and change the price to one cent per ladle from now on. Those who exceed the price limit will be severely punished after investigation.</p>
<p>Public Utility Factory: According to a letter from the Machine-Made Coal Briquette Industry Association, the No. 2 factory of the Public Utility Coal Briquette Factory at No. 699 Changping Road has now received a letter from the Public Works Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council, ordering it to be closed on the 8th of this month. However, the factory is currently rushing to produce coal briquettes and producing as much as possible to supply the market and reduce panic. If it is closed, there will inevitably be a shortage of goods on the market, which is contrary to the policy of relieving the fuel panic. Therefore, we are writing to the Municipal Council to request that the closing date of the No. 2 factory be postponed for 60 days, so that when the new factory is completed, it can continue to produce briquettes, which will be beneficial to the industry's business and the supply and demand of fuel.</p>

He was hit by two bullets on the spot, one in the chest and one in the left arm, with blood flowing straight down. He fell to the ground in response. The three assailants fled in different directions. When the nearby police arrived, the assailants had already escaped far away. Later, he was sent to Guangci Hospital for treatment by police car. It was learned afterwards that he had been bathing with the three men in a certain bathhouse there and was attacked in this way after going out.</p>
<h3 id="e57">After the Sinking of the Jingsheng Ferry, It Was Struck Again by Turbulent Currents, Sunken Ship No Longer in Original Location, Still Not Salvaged, Over 200 Passengers Likely Drowned Inside Cabin <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>Following the tragic sinking of the Ningbo ferry Jingsheng at the Ningbo wharf, groups in Shanghai and Ningbo have actively been handling the aftermath. The Ningbo Native Place Association in Shanghai has allocated 10,000 yuan for relief, which was remitted yesterday. Ten divers also took the Kaiming ferry yesterday afternoon to宁波. A reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency has continued to record the details as follows:</p>
<p>Donations Remitted: In order to assist the authorities in handling the aftermath, the Ningbo Native Place Association in Shanghai convened a temporary joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committees the day before yesterday afternoon. In addition to sending a telegram to Yu Jimin, the head of the Jingsheng Ferry disaster relief committee, that evening to express condolences to the families of the victims, 10,000 yuan was allocated from the disaster relief donation fund in Ningbo and remitted to Ningbo by telegram yesterday morning, so that the authorities could spend it as soon as possible to handle the aftermath.</p>
<p>Sunken Ship Missing: It was learned yesterday that the capsized Jingsheng Ferry was originally near the north bank of the Ningbo port, but the water flow there is turbulent. According to later investigations, the sunken ship is no longer in its original location and has generally drifted to the vicinity of the Sanjiangkou estuary, so it has not yet been salvaged. According to inquiries from the ticket sales department of the Moufu Ferry, 102 people had not boarded the ferry to Shanghai. These passengers were all in the upper cabin of the Jingsheng Ferry at the time and must have drowned inside the cabin, resulting in most of the bodies still missing.</p>
<p>Additional Divers Hired: The Ningbo Barge Transportation Company telegraphed Shanghai the day before yesterday to hire divers to go there to salvage the bodies. The shipping department of the Moufu Ferry hired three people on its behalf. It was learned yesterday that because Ningbo urgently needed to salvage the bodies, it hired seven more people, for a total of ten. The group departed from Shanghai at 12:00 noon yesterday aboard the Kaiming barge of the Fengyu Public Customs Brokerage, going directly to Ningbo.</p>
<h3 id="e58">Lu Ying Visits Baugham: "Special Police Force" Unlikely to Be Established Due to Lack of Concrete Plans, Shanghai's West District Crimes Remain Unaddressed by Japanese Side <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Times reported that "Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau Chief" Lu Ying visited Major Baugham, chief of the Public Concession Police Force, at the Public Concession Police Headquarters yesterday (the 4th) afternoon, and held an initial informal discussion on the establishment of a special police force for extraterritorial roads. Accompanied by Ying on his return was his advisor, Colonel Igarashi, and Shi Maoru, deputy chief of the Police Force, and Akagi Chikashi, special deputy chief, also participated in this informal meeting. No concrete plans for the special police force were put forward by either side during the discussion, but it was decided that after the Police Force and "officials from the Municipal Police Bureau" studied certain documents, another meeting would be held next week. The special police force is the organization stipulated in the provisional agreement signed by the Municipal Council and the "Municipal Government" two weeks ago, and is the first step in resolving disputes over extraterritorial roads.</p>
<p>Closure of Gambling Dens Repeatedly Postponed: The Continental Daily reported yesterday (the 4th) that it was learned from official sources that the gambling dens in Shanghai's West District would not be cleared until the new "Special Police Force" jointly formed by the Municipal Council and the Shanghai Municipal Government" was established, but the date of the team's establishment has not yet been determined. It was reported at the beginning of the month that the "Shanghai Municipal Government" would close all the gambling dens in the West District in February, but this did not materialize. It was later reported that it had been postponed to March 10th. Yesterday, the police bureau claimed that "Although this move is sincere, it cannot be realized until there is a large police force to handle the situation."</p>
<p>If Not Cleared, They Will Become More Rampant: It is said that the Japanese army's profits from the crime venues in the West District amount to about 1.5 million yuan per month, so the Japanese army itself cannot clear the crime situation. The only way is to leave the management of the West District to impartial organs. On the other hand, the responsible new police force will not take on the policing work in the area until a policy is determined on how to handle the situation. Once the new police agency takes over the area, it must either thoroughly clear it or allow the crimes to continue to be rampant and collect a portion of the income from the crime venues.</p>
<p>All Plans Under Discussion: Major Baugham, chief of the Public Concession Police Force, will discuss the establishment plan of the new police force with "Municipal Police Bureau Chief" Lu Ying at length this week. It is said that the Police Force has drafted a plan for the new police district and the address of the police station, in order to tax the roads outside the boundary and its adjacent areas. Some of the police station addresses are those of the "Dadao Police Bureau" that has already been established. This plan will be accepted by the "Shanghai Municipal Government" and will be discussed during this period.</p>

When another Japanese freighter, Duxima Maru (transliteration), attempted to berth alongside the wharf in front of the Xinbao Maru, it got too close to the Xinbao Maru, causing three of the small boats between the two ships to be squeezed and capsized, and at least five others to be heavily damaged. Thousands of bags of flour and other items fell into the water, but most of them have been salvaged, and there were no deaths or injuries.</p>

At that time, the Japanese side issued a statement stating that Colonel Shi "destroyed the Japanese military law, but the extent of his destruction was excusable," so he was released.</p>

<p>All the workers of the British-owned China General Omnibus Company went on strike due to demands for improved treatment. The case was mediated by Mr. Yu Qiaqing, who invited both parties to negotiate. All the workers' demands were negotiated and resolved. All the workers expressed extreme satisfaction. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Conditions Satisfactory: All the workers of the public bus company put forward twelve demands to the company authorities in order to demand improved treatment. Mr. Yu Qiaqing, the Chinese director of the Municipal Council, together with the Industrial Section of the police force, convened a mediation meeting at 6:00 PM the day before yesterday. All the labor's demands were negotiated and resolved satisfactorily. The content is recorded below: (1) Living allowance, increase from the current 10% to 30%. (2) Rice allowance method, changed to allow each person to purchase half a picul of rice per month at a price of 15 yuan, regardless of the extent to which the rice price rises, all losses will be borne by the company. (3) Cancel the 1936 new worker application form. Starting from 1940, all workers will be given an annual bonus. (4) If a person is not at fault, the company will never arbitrarily dismiss him. (5) During the strike period, wages will be paid as usual, and negotiations will be held separately. (6) If a person dies or becomes disabled on duty, the company will issue pensions, bereavement payments, funeral expenses, etc. The company has already implemented this, and there is no problem. (7) Same as Article 3, no problem. (8) Workers injured in this strike, after being examined by a doctor sent by the company and confirmed to be true, all medical expenses and wages will be borne by the company. (9) Each worker's work shall not exceed eight hours, no problem. (10 &amp; 11) Both items were automatically withdrawn by the labor side. (12) Workers in the mechanical department who have worked for six months will be considered for promotion to full-time workers. In addition, the coppersmith requested a free bus pass, and Mr. Yu was responsible for negotiating with the company. Therefore, the entire case was satisfactorily resolved.</p>
<p>Workers Gratified: The labor and management negotiated the conditions for five hours the day before yesterday before reaching a resolution. Mr. Yu Qiaqing drafted a letter to inform the workers, hoping that they would work with peace of mind. The letter was handed over to the labor representatives. At 8:00 AM yesterday morning, the labor side convened a meeting of the cadres of each department, and the attending representatives reported on the negotiation and resolution process and read Mr. Yu Qiao's notification letter. All the workers expressed satisfaction with the resolution plan, especially expressing unusual gratitude for the efforts of Director Yu Qiaqing and the Concession authorities to mediate and provide well-intentioned advice. It was heard that in addition to accepting the resolution plan on the spot, it was also decided to publish a notice in the newspaper to thank Mr. Yu and all parties.</p>
<p>Gratitude Notice: The labor side issued a gratitude notice yesterday, stating that "This time, our colleagues requested that the company authorities improve treatment, resulting in a labor dispute. We are grateful to Director Yu Qiaqing for not sparing his efforts to be responsible for mediation, and to Mr. McKay of the Municipal Council Police Force, Liao Zhongqian, and Mr. Gu Bingyuan of the Industrial Section for their assistance, so that it could be resolved satisfactorily. Our colleagues are deeply grateful and thank all sectors for their concern, assistance, sympathy, and condolences. In addition to thanking them in person, we specially publish this notice in the newspaper to express our heartfelt thanks. We hope that you will take note."</p>
<p>Reported in Western Newspapers: The Continental Daily reported that "It was heard from reliable sources yesterday that the workers of the British-owned public bus company went on strike since last Thursday because the salaries of the foreign employees of the company had increased by 15%, and the senior Chinese personnel warned the company not to take this 'discriminatory measure', but the company ignored it. According to a representative of the workers, a senior company official said that he did not hear about the impending strike until the night of Wednesday, which is not true, because the workers had warned the company in advance. Since the salaries of foreign employees have been increased by 15%, it is not excessive for Chinese employees to demand an increase of 14%, because the salaries of Chinese workers are, on average, much lower than those of foreign employees. After the strike occurred, a certain party sent people to campaign and promised the workers that if they continued the strike, they would be subsidized by the party. However, before the strike, they were never instigated by anyone."</p>
<h3 id="e64">Miscellaneous Grain Industry Establishes Import Group, Expands Foreign Rice Sources, Prevents Price Gouging, Stipulates That Goods Must Be Cleared Within Ten Days, Overdue Goods Will Be Reported by Seller as Hoarding <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Miscellaneous Grain, Oil Cake Industry Association, the fellow traders engaged in foreign rice, specially established an import group to promote contact among the fellow traders, to collude to expand the source of foreign rice, in order to help suppress market prices. The group stipulates that in order to prevent speculation and raising market prices in foreign rice trading, the buyer must clear the goods within ten days of the transaction at the latest. If there is a delay, the seller can report it as hoarding. After this proposal was published, it was like a head-on blow to those who speculate, so the trend of speculation has been slightly curbed. Recently, the market price of foreign rice has been falling back day by day, which has a considerable impact. Regarding the buyer's taking of rice samples when shipping the goods, the sample bag is enlarged as much as possible, and the capacity is also increased, but the rice bag is pierced into holes, and leaks often occur, which invisibly increases the cost. The group is trying to correct this and is now widely soliciting styles and mutually seeking improvement. Regarding expanding the source of supply, it is considered to be the fundamental key to regulating people's food and suppressing rice prices at present. The group has decided to gather the strength of the fellow traders to do its utmost. Therefore, foreign rice will continue to be shipped to Shanghai, so that the entire people's food supply will not be in danger of being deficient.</p>
<p>Large Quantities Arrive: Large quantities of foreign rice are arriving one after another. Yesterday, more than 45,000 bags arrived in Shanghai. It is intended that the Yilunlinsaniutuo (transliteration) ship transported 15,166 bags of foreign rice from Saigon, as well as 20,717 bags of corn (i.e. pearl rice). The ship was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai the day before yesterday, but due to the influence of the weather, it only entered the port at about 11:00 AM yesterday and docked at the Hongkou Shuntai Wharf to unload. The corn was purchased by foreign firms such as Fujia, Heyi, and Dafu. Most of the foreign rice is handled by Jianyuan and others. The De Sheng ship of the Qiahe Foreign Company transported 2,026 bags from Hong Kong, and the Jinan ship of the Taikoo Company transported 2,724 bags from Haiphong, as well as 6,896 bags from Hong Kong, and the Suzhou ship transported 20,534 bags directly from Siam. All the ships arrived in Shanghai before noon yesterday and are already unloading.</p>
<p>Siamese Rice Arrives for the First Time: Previously, the foreign rice that arrived was all Saigon foreign indica rice from French Indochina. The Siamese rice transported by the Su Lun yesterday was the first time. The second round of the Zha Hua Mail Steamship Company's ship Savo Luo (transliteration), which is contracted to transport foreign rice, will transport about 40,000 bags from Yangon, and it is heard that it will be able to arrive in Shanghai tomorrow (the 7th).

<p>The gambling dens in Nanshi's fake bureaus all automatically suspended operations on the second because it was rumored that the French authorities and Father Jacquinot, the founder of the refugee area, opposed them, but from the third, the Heng'an Company at No. 24 Heng'anfang on the Nanyang Bridge, because the host, Li Xiaobao, the king of lotteries, had a strong background, was the first to resume business, and others such as the Xieli Company at No. 14 Wengjia Lane in the Old West Gate and the Xieji Company at No. 1 Anrenli, Qingyun Street, Nine Acres Land, have also reopened one after another. There is also the Dazhong Company at No. 163 Fuyou Road in the refugee area, which is scheduled to open on the 6th, and the Rong Sheng Company is also being renovated and prepared to open at No. 1 Zhao Fang Lane, Lao Ximenkou Xiangzheng Xing. At the same time, lottery gambling is everywhere, and the harm is particularly serious. The rumor that all the gambling dens in Nanshi have been closed and that the Nanshi fake police station strictly prohibits gambling is purely a lie.</p>

<p>The English-language *Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury* reported that the British Embassy issued a notice this morning (5th) warning British nationals not to send mail to England via Siberia. The notice stated that it had recently been reported that letters from China to England had been opened by German inspectors. It was then discovered that these letters were sent to England via Siberia. Under the current circumstances, although these letters should not pass through German territory, there is a risk that they may transit through Germany. This is because once the letters leave Chinese territory, they are no longer under the control of the Chinese postal authorities. However, mail from China to Europe is often routed through Siberia. Therefore, the British Embassy hereby informs British nationals that letters to England that do not clearly specify a route may fall into the hands of German inspectors.</p>

<p>The Yongtai Chang copper and tin shop at No. 825 Beijing Road, owned by Wu Haitang from Shaoxing, has recently been melting old-style copper coins at the behest of Wu, who, seeing the soaring prices of everything and especially the price of copper, knew there was an opportunity. He only cared about making profit and disregarded national laws. He instructed the shop assistants to collect old copper coins and entrusted Yu Jinsheng and Xu Changlin, both from Shaoxing and residing at No. 8, Lane 140, Xinzha Road, to melt the coins and sell them at high prices. This matter was discovered by Yang Feihua, a Chinese detective of the Xinzha Police Station. Believing that such behavior clearly violated national laws, he, together with a Western detective, Lytton, went to Xinzha Road yesterday afternoon, arrested Yu and Xu, and confiscated a large bag of copper coins and thirteen melted copper bars. They then went to Yongtai Chang on Beijing Road to arrest the owner, but he had already fled upon hearing the news. Only two shop assistants, Li Guilin and Jiang Qingrong, were apprehended and taken to the police station for detention. They were escorted to the Second Criminal Court of the District Court yesterday morning. The police lawyer, Zhang Tianyin, described the case and requested a postponement. Judge Fu briefly interrogated the four defendants and ordered them to be detained for a rescheduled hearing this Saturday.</p>

<p>Guo Yutang, a shareholder of the Laofengxiang Gold Shop on Nanjing Road, previously dissatisfied with various aspects of the manager, Fei Zushou, proposed a withdrawal of shares. However, after negotiations, a final settlement could not be reached as the figures differed by too much. Guo had threatened to file a lawsuit against Fei for embezzlement. Then, at the end of last year, Fei suddenly received two threatening letters purportedly from a special task force. He entrusted lawyers Jiang Baoli and Jiang Pingfan to report the matter to the Zhabei Police Station. After detailed investigation, it was believed that the threatening letters were written by Guo Xiukai, son of Guo Yutang. Hua detective Xue Youwen arrested Guo Xiukai and sent him to the First Special District Court for interrogation and detention. Yesterday, Judge Xiao Xiefei continued the trial in the First Criminal Court. Police lawyer Ru BaoYi presented to the court a report from Mei Yu, a handwriting expert from the Public Works Department, to prove that the threatening letters were indeed written by Guo Xiukai, which Guo firmly denied. His defense lawyer, Zou Yusheng, requested the court to appoint another expert for a re-examination to ensure impartiality. After reviewing the evidence, Judge Xiao ordered a postponement of the case pending the appointment of an expert to authenticate the handwriting. The defendant, Guo Xiukai, was granted bail of 3,000 yuan and allowed to leave under the custody of his defense lawyer, Zou Yu, who would later provide the official bail bond.</p>

<p>four conditions: (1) a gift of 1,000 yuan to the woman's family; (2) four pieces of gold jewelry for the woman; (3) a self-owned house; (4) a full set of rosewood furniture. Li, due to insufficient financial resources, could not accept. He asked the matchmakers to negotiate with the woman. She eventually agreed to reduce the gift money to 500 yuan. Li then proposed that the wedding take place on January 19th of this year and set the Dengtuomo Hotel as the wedding hall. However, when the time came, the woman</p>

<p>To the Editor: We are writing in response to a statement by Mr. Kuile that appeared in the local news section of the first page of the Shen Bao on the 2nd of this month, regarding "Fake personnel intimidating and extorting money." This is not in accordance with the facts. On October 17th of last year, Mr. Kuile and his son-in-law, Ruan Wangxing, were at the Hongkou vegetable market demanding the repayment of membership fees and loans from Mr. and Mrs. He. Mr. and Mrs. He were unreasonable and abusive, leading to a dispute. At the time, there were many vendors in the vegetable market, who gathered to watch, resulting in interference from Japanese military police, who took Mr. Kuile and others to the consulate for questioning. After learning that the dispute was about money, they ordered Mr. and Mrs. He to repay the money in installments and released Mr. Kuile and others. The interference of the Japanese military police was not at the instigation of Mr. Kuile, nor was Mr. and Mrs. He handcuffed when they went to the Japanese consulate. There was also no illegal assault or extortion of money. Moreover, the unpaid portion of the loan has already been judged by the Shanghai First Special District Court to be repaid by Mr. and Mrs. He, which shows that Mr. and Mrs. He were entirely trying to evade the debt and therefore made a false accusation. As the case is already in court, the truth will be revealed and a legal solution will be obtained. As this is related to Mr. Kuile's reputation, we are writing to request a correction. Yours sincerely, Lawyer Zhang Zhiguo, March 5th.</p>

<p>(5) Compiling and Issuing Short and Small Textbooks: Counties in this province with inconvenient transportation find it difficult to purchase short and small textbooks, and the cost of books and transportation is a considerable burden. To address the issue of insufficient funds for schools and to alleviate their difficulties in purchasing books, measures for book publishers to send short and small textbooks to various counties and cities have been established. Book publishers will directly send the books to various county and city governments according to the number of textbooks prescribed, within five days of receiving the notification from the Department of Education. County and city mayors and principals only need to collect them when receiving funds, which is very convenient. Half of the funds for this item will be allocated from the central and provincial compulsory education funds, and the remaining half will be used as equipment funds to enrich the content. Since implementation, there have been no major obstacles.</p>
<p>(6) Experimenting with Diagnosis and Treatment of Diseases in Short-Term Schoolchildren: Due to financial constraints, short-term schools in various counties lack adequate facilities for health matters. Starting in the second to fifth year of the Republic, this province began cooperating with the Department of Civil Affairs and the Provincial Health Experimental Office to designate Lin'an, Yuhang, Fuyang, Xindeng, and Shihua counties to experiment with the diagnosis and treatment of heat rash, eye disease, and malaria in schoolchildren, and to promote smallpox vaccination. As a result, 6,400 schoolchildren were vaccinated against smallpox, with positive results. However, the diagnosis and treatment of heat rash and malaria was not implemented, which is regrettable.</p>
<p>Other matters stipulated in Article 5 of the National Compulsory Education Outline, such as (1) promoting graded primary schools, (2) enriching the number of students in existing grades, (3) rigorously implementing the system, (4) improving private schools, and (5) experimenting with itinerant education, have all had implementation measures drafted and ordered to be followed by various counties.</p>
<p>In short, compulsory education during the 24th and 25th years of the Republic was like a newborn infant, waiting to continue to grow. When the July 7th Incident occurred at Lugouqiao, and the Japanese invaders attacked, the capital was occupied, and the provincial capital fell, the three western Zhejiang prefectures became guerrilla areas. The counties in eastern Zhejiang were also affected by military matters and population movements, creating an anti-government situation. Educational facilities had to adapt to the needs of wartime. Therefore, compulsory education entered another stage. Since the War of Resistance, compulsory education has taken on a wartime function. From the full-scale War of Resistance that began in August of the 26th year, it will not be possible to conclude until the end of the war. It is difficult to separate them. Therefore, when discussing the current status of compulsory education implementation in this province, strictly speaking, it should be from the 26th year of the Republic onwards. The items already completed and those pending are listed as follows:</p>
<p>A. Post-War Compulsory Education Matters Already Completed</p>
<p>(1) Implementing Mobile Teaching: At the beginning of the War of Resistance, a significant number of school-age children from the counties in western Zhejiang that had become guerrilla areas retreated to the counties in eastern Zhejiang. The educational funds of the counties in eastern Zhejiang were mostly stretched, and even existing schools had experienced shutdowns. Therefore, many children of school age could not enroll and wandered around all day. If remedial measures were not taken quickly, there would be serious consequences. However, due to the military situation and scattered relocation, fixed education methods could not be used. Therefore, mobile education facilities were established. In the second semester of the 26th year, the Department of Education issued the "Outline for the Establishment of Mobile Schools" and allocated a portion of the funds from the central and provincial compulsory education funds. Forty provincial-run mobile schools were established in fifteen counties close to the war zone, such as Xiaoshan, as a pioneering effort. In the 27th year, the Department of Education re-issued the "Outline for the Implementation of Mobile Education in War Zones in Zhejiang Province." Regarding compulsory education, a total of twenty-nine mobile schools were established in the war zone counties.</p>

<h3 id="e101">Finance: Sassoon Continues to Buy Vigorously, Exchange Rates for British and American Currencies Tighten Again <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>In the foreign exchange market yesterday, the HSBC exchange rate remained unchanged after the announcement. The unofficial market for British and American currencies initially showed a slight easing, but suddenly tightened again later in the day. As a result, both spot rates weakened. This was because Sassoon continued to buy aggressively, reportedly purchasing over 300,000 yuan worth of U.S. dollars. Furthermore, HSBC was actively buying throughout the day, so the market could not rise for long. In the early morning, the exchange rates for British and American currencies overseas contracted sharply by 1.625 points, causing the market to open with a tight U.S. dollar and flat British pound. The prices were 4 pence 1.5625 and 6.78125 yuan, respectively. Later, a certain Chinese bank and a group of speculators jointly sold, causing the market to suddenly rise to 4 pence 1.71875 and 6.8125 yuan. However, HSBC was interested in buying at the aforementioned selling price, and a Japanese yarn factory suddenly came to purchase, coupled with Sassoon's aggressive buying, causing the market to quickly tighten. The U.S. dollar immediately contracted to 6.75 yuan, while the British pound remained at 4 pence 1.5625. Later, the buyers stopped buying, and many speculators sold their positions, causing the U.S. dollar to ease again. However, HSBC suddenly resumed buying at noon, and it was rumored that a few speculators saw the situation and started buying again, causing the market to tighten again. By the close of the market, the rates had retreated to 4 pence 1.40625 and 6.71875 yuan. The afternoon market was quiet. Although a Japanese yarn factory came to purchase spot sterling again, foreign banks were willing to sell, so there was little impact. The tightest rate for the British pound was 4 pence 1.125. However, by the close of the market, the British pound was still at 4 pence 1.40625, and the U.S. dollar was at 6.71875 yuan. As a result, the rates tightened by 0.015625 and 0.09375 compared to the previous day. The potential for futures was no different from the spot market.</p>
<p>Chinese Merchants Initially Sold Jointly</p>
<p>In the early morning, due to the large orders from London, the near-term rate rose sharply by 1.0625 pence, and the far-term rate rose sharply by 875. The New York silver price remained flat. The British pound exchange rate against the U.S. dollar, Shanghai yuan, and French franc were all flat. The U.S. dollar fell 1.625 points against the British pound, 5 points against the Shanghai yuan, and 1.25 points against the French franc. The central bank's exchange rates remained unchanged. The opening selling prices of spot rates at banks in the morning were 4 pence 1.5625 for the British pound and 6.78125 yuan for the U.S. dollar, tighter by 0.03125 for the U.S. dollar compared to the previous close, due to the contraction of exchange rates. At the same time, the opening prices of futures also showed a flat British pound and a contraction of 0.03125 for the U.S. dollar. After the opening, a certain Chinese bank sold first, and then speculators followed suit, causing the market to harden slightly. The Chinese bank sold spot U.S. dollars to HSBC at 6.8125 yuan, and speculators sold U.S. dollar futures for the next month to a certain bank at 6.6875 yuan. At that time, spot sterling could be settled at 4 pence 1.71875. The HSBC exchange rate remained unchanged after the announcement. The silver balance tax rose by 6 points. After that, a Japanese yarn factory needed to purchase, and Sassoon also followed suit, buying a large amount of U.S. dollars, causing the market to suddenly tighten. The Japanese yarn factory settled spot sterling for this month at 4 pence 1.09375, and Sassoon settled a large amount of U.S. dollars, benefitting a certain bank, for this month at 6.6875 yuan. At that time, the spot U.S. dollar had weakened to 6.75 yuan, but the British pound had returned to 4 pence 1.5625. Later, the buying momentum gradually subsided, and the potential became flat. At 10:30, speculators came again to sell U.S. dollar futures for this month, causing the U.S. dollar to ease again. Unexpectedly, after 11:30, HSBC returned to buy spot sterling from a Chinese bank at 4 pence 1.40625 and purchased spot U.S. dollars from a fellow bank at 6.78125 yuan. Therefore, the process softened again. By the noon close, the British pound was still at 4 pence 1.40625, and the U.S. dollar was only at 6.71875 yuan, tighter by 0.015625 for the British pound and weaker by 0.0625 for the U.S. dollar compared to the morning opening. The tightness of the British and American futures exchange rates was also the same as the spot prices.</p>
<p>Japanese Factories Purchased Spot Sterling</p>
<p>The afternoon market was slightly calmer. Although a Japanese yarn factory came to purchase spot sterling again, the impact was small. Spot sterling was settled with a foreign bank at 4 pence 1.125. At the same time, a Dutch bank sold U.S. dollars for this month at 6.65625 yuan, and a certain bank sold U.S. dollars for the same month to speculators, also at 6.65625 yuan. Later, only Hong Kong banks sold sterling and bought U.S. dollars, with little change. By the close of the evening market, the British pound was at 4 pence 1.40625, the U.S. dollar was at 6.71875 yuan, the British pound for this month was at 4 pence 1.09375, and the U.S. dollar was at 6.65625 yuan. The British pound for next month was at 4 pence 0.0625, and the U.S. dollar was at 6.5625 yuan. As a result, the spot British pound tightened by 0.015625, and the U.S. dollar weakened by 0.09375 compared to the previous day.</p>

<h3 id="e102">Hong Kong Banks Purchase Vigorously, Gold Prices Rise Again Yesterday, Ultimately Creating a Wavering Situation Due to Money Supply Issues <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's spot gold unofficial market entered a firm and rising phase again. This was because foreign exchange tightened and Hong Kong banks purchased strongly, ultimately rising by 57 yuan. It opened in the morning up 17 yuan, at 4,750 yuan. The reason was that foreign exchange tightened after loosening. Later, a certain securities firm sold short again, causing it to be pressed down to a low price of 4,735 yuan. Then, a Hong Kong bank suddenly entrusted a certain brokerage to buy, and money exchange firms also purchased, causing the potential to strengthen again, rising sharply by 40 yuan. However, a certain bank suddenly sold on behalf of long positions and fell back. Ultimately, Hong Kong banks resumed buying, and as foreign exchange was reported to be tight, and it was heard that HSBC was eating well, people's confidence was greatly boosted, and retail investors aggressively purchased, reaching as high as 4,806 yuan. At noon, money exchange firms took profits and sold, slightly pulling back. In the early afternoon, securities firms frequently sold, continuing to fall to 4,782 yuan. Then, a certain money exchange firm and a certain gold firm strongly competed to buy on behalf of two Hong Kong banks, and a certain securities firm also purchased, rising again to a high point of 4,810 yuan. Later, a certain securities firm sold aggressively, and as the foreign exchange market was reported to be stable, it immediately pulled back to 4,780 yuan. However, a certain gold firm bought again, so the closing price was still at 4,790 yuan. The total transaction volume for the day was approximately 2,600-700 taels. The price of gold ornaments in silver shops rose by 5 yuan. The customs gold price remained flat.</p>
<p>Spot Gold Rises by 57 Yuan</p>
<p>From the morning, each bar (10 taels), the foreign exchange market initially loosened and then softened, and the situation was still good. It opened up by 17 yuan. First, a certain silver shop and gold firm bought 50 taels, for 4,750 yuan. Later, a certain securities firm sold short again, causing it to be pressed down by 15 yuan. The securities firm sold 30 taels to a certain gold firm, for 4,735 yuan. After that, a certain gold firm continued to buy aggressively on behalf of Hong Kong banks, and money exchange firms also followed suit. Although certain silver shops sold on behalf of long positions, the inventory was still insufficient, rising by 40 yuan. A certain silver shop and a silver shop bought 20 taels each from money exchange firms, both for 4,775 yuan. Then, Hong Kong banks stopped activities, and the buying momentum gradually subsided. The securities firms also sold, falling by 19 yuan. Silver shops mutually traded 30 taels, for 4,756 yuan. Ultimately, as Hong Kong banks came to buy again, prices became firm and rose again. Soon after, as foreign exchange was reported to be soft, morale rose, and retail investors aggressively purchased, jumping out of the 4,800 yuan barrier. A gold firm bought 20 taels from a silver shop, for 4,806 yuan. At that time, a certain money exchange firm took profits and sold, pulling back by 16 yuan.

<p>Yesterday's securities unofficial market was relatively firm, and the trend was extremely sluggish, with most people taking a wait-and-see attitude. Those who sold a large number of shares had to have a considerable number of buyers to absorb them. Various news, whether positive or negative, could not be concretely confirmed. The consistent principle of the big players in the market, whether long or short, has not changed. Without major news, the market price is not easy to change. The situation in the morning and afternoon was almost exactly the same. The afternoon was comparatively firmer. Tong Shun sold throughout, Tai Feng bought throughout, Xin Fu also had needs, Jiu Feng slightly replenished. Sheng Da, Ju Xin, and No. 38 all sold. Nos. 14, 41, Hong Da, Ding Kang all purchased.

<p>Yesterday, the stock market in the Public Exchange opened sluggishly. Then, the selling orders determined the night before came one after another. The market was immersed in a flood of selling, and prices plummeted severely. All the stocks sold were disposed of at market prices, regardless of fluctuations. As a result, many industrial stocks hit record lows. Near noon, a large number of buying orders poured in and were snapped up. The stormy selling momentum was stopped. The market situation turned sharply upward, and prices were lifted up, rising sharply, and even exceeding the level at the opening. This kind of sharp rebound in price caused the sellers to sell again in the afternoon, but it was almost completely absorbed. Most of the closing prices recovered to the morning closing prices.</p>
<p>Rubber stocks performed better, and there were constant buyers throughout the day. The closing price was also extremely stable.</p>
<p>London, 4th (Monday) Electricity: The listed prices of Chinese foreign bonds today remained stable. The prices of bonds up and down were unchanged.</p>

<h3 id="e104">Grains: Foreign Rice Floods In, Rice Market Plummets, Over 40,000 Bags Arrive Again Yesterday, Unofficial Market for Domestic Rice Also Eases <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's rice market continued to decline, with drastic changes rarely seen in recent times. Both buyers and sellers feared suffering unexpected losses. The market slumped, and morale was discouraged, and they rushed to sell. Recycled goods were pushed out one after another. How could the local shops be foolish? Seeing the sellers wavering and the market full of goods, they slightly increased their purchases and did not dare to buy too much. Therefore, the shouting price at the opening of the morning market was two or three corners lower. Later, they went downstream step by step, depreciating by six or seven corners. For example, Saigon's Special Grade 1 was sold from 47.5 yuan to 47.2-3 yuan, 47 yuan. Fire-jiao was sold from 46 yuan to 45.5 yuan, 45.2-3 yuan. Mid-range goods such as Saigon's No. 2 Small Pattern, No. 2 Siamese Tokyo, and pointed glutinous rice were especially sluggish, falling by about one yuan. Foreign rice was crowded due to all shipments arriving on the same day. One or two ships arrived in Shanghai every day. In addition to the continuous orders placed after the previous day, foreign merchants were still continuing to sell. Importers disliked the high price and did not continue to finalize the deal. Even recycled futures lacked buyers under the pressure of floating accounts seeking to sell. Little Jiao March was still lacking a buyer at 51 yuan. Nos. 1 and 2 Saigon lowered by half a yuan and still had no way out. The entire market only had 200 tons of recycled No. 2 Siamese rice being traded, with a price of 52 yuan to 51.9 yuan.</p>
<p>A Large Number of Imported Foreign Rice Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday. The Italian ship Man Lin Sa Niu Tuo (transliterated) transported 8,052 bags of foreign rice and 7,113 bags of broken rice from Saigon. In addition, 20,717 bags of corn (i.e., pearl rice) were also transported. The corn was handled by French merchants Fuka Foreign Firm Heyi Da Fu, etc. Most of the foreign rice was handled by Jian Yuan Company. It was imported at about 11:00 yesterday morning and was docked at Hongkou Shuntai Wharf to unload. The Taikoo Company's Suzhou wheel directly loaded 20,534 bags of foreign rice from Siam, and the Jinan wheel loaded 2,724 bags from Haiphong, and 6,896 bags from Hong Kong. The Jardine Matheson Company's Desheng wheel loaded 2,026 bags from Hong Kong. All arrived in port before noon yesterday. A total of four wheels transported 45,320 bags (Zu).</p>
<p>Glutinous rice also depreciated by half a yuan along with it. Liyang Special Yuan was 42.5 yuan, and Danyang Special Yuan was 41.5 yuan. The number of thick and thin japonica rice and early and late indica rice from the mainland sources transferred out from Hongkou yesterday was very small, still only over 300 bags of early and late indica rice from Nan Gang. The unofficial transactions outside the market were said to be still sparse. The opening price also continued to decline by half a yuan. Looking at the trend of the rice market, based on yesterday's phenomenon, it seems that it is still difficult to gain a foothold, or there may be a more violent drop. Judging from the previous price drop, the lowest price of Saigon's Grade 1 was 43.5 yuan, which is still three or four yuan lower than yesterday's price. Considering this drop, if there is no hope of a turning point in a short time, then "the road is straight down, back to the original market price before, it is really possible. Or if there is an unexpected large number of futures arriving at that time, then returning to the closing prices at the end of last year is also imaginable. If it can be so, it will be a great fortune for the people's food.</p>
<h3 id="e105">Flour Market Continues to Weaken, There Is a Rumor That Export Flour Has Stopped Giving Tax Bills <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's flour market continued to weaken. The price of the No. 2 flour mill was unchanged during the flat selling period. Apart from the limited 7,500 bags, there was no surplus to give. Therefore, those who needed it still had to rely on recycled flour. However, due to the sluggish sales of customers in recent days, it was heard that there was a sudden suspension of tax bills for foreign ports, so people's hearts were disheartened. The buying and selling outside the industry had already come to an end. The entire market only had the inland countryside to clear, and thousands of bags of old brand stack orders were traded, with prices of 14.6 yuan and 6.5 points, slightly looser than the previous day. There is no hope for the market to expand for the time being.</p>
<p>Yesterday, wheat was also dull. There was little development in the clearing of Hua factories and export gangs. The market rumored that a certain factory had continued to order foreign wheat, but the factory denied it. Therefore, domestic wheat was unwilling to be sold off easily. The Suzhou white wheat opened yesterday still required a price of 14.5 yuan. The fixed Changzhou wheat opened at 24 yuan, with six cars traded.</p>
<h3 id="e106">Yarn and Cotton: Exchange Rates Slightly Tighten, Yarn Market Revives, Double Horse Spot Goods Recovered 8 Yuan <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the falling yarn market recovered somewhat. This was because foreign exchange tightened slightly again, causing the various parties to regroup, buy back again, and turn the market tighter, rising up. However, the actual demand was not as large as the previous day. At present, the yarn market is deeply afraid of being on the path of wavering. The long parties are still optimistic about the March period and never give up on absorbing the amount. However, the short parties are thinking of taking a step back, as the price has reached a high level, and are unwilling to take more actions.</p>
<p>The opening trend of spot yarn in the morning was flat. The opening price of 20-count Double Horse in March was 892 yuan. As soon as this market opened, the buyers came again to add more, and the momentum was tighter and more expensive. The market price gradually opened to 903 yuan. When prices were rising, the short parties also came to sell and add more, and the market situation was slightly exhausted, and then entered the 900 yuan mark. By the time of the close, it was heard that the foreign exchange market had contracted, and the market situation had revived. It was found that 1,958 bags were transacted in half a day. The spot price of 20-count Double Horse rose by 8 yuan. Today, 100 pieces of yarn were transported to Haiphong. The amount of money bought by the various gangs is divided as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e107">Factory Offices Stop, Cotton Market Ordinary, Yao Cotton Arrives in Shanghai One After Another <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>Cotton trading was relatively clear. The factory seemed to have no office stomach. As for American cotton, although it rebounded, Indian cotton still tended to be flat and tired, so people's hearts were ordinary. As for the sources in northern Jiangsu, a total of 1,246 bags of Tong cotton were purchased. The transaction situation of the current cotton is listed on the left:</p>
<p>Fire Machine Grass Bag 196.00 Fellow Trades 139 bags</p>
<p>Fire Machine Wooden Frame 202.25 Also 100 pieces</p>
<p>Meter Lin 264.00 Also 200 pieces</p>
<p>Tongzhou 204.00 203.00 Also 200 bags</p>
<p>The American Hengda Foreign Firm purchased cotton in eastern Zhejiang, and previously sent a special wheel to transport two batches, totaling 19,000 bags. The above situation was recorded in the previous report. It is now known that the Lihe Foreign Firm's Moufu wheel also loaded more than 5,000 bags of cotton purchased by the firm from Ningbo yesterday (4th), which has been taken away from the firm's side of the boat. It is said that another batch will be transported within the day, and a large batch of American cotton will also arrive in Shanghai (Zu).</p>
<p>Another news from the foreign cotton market: the New York cotton market was very firm when it opened yesterday morning. It rose first due to the purchase of speculators, and then due to the purchase of fellow traders and overseas cotton merchants. As a result, the closing price rose by 12 to 13 pounds more than the previous day. India, including forecasts, rose by more than 4 rubles yesterday. Egypt fell by more than 20 pounds.</p>
<p>In Shanghai, the transaction of foreign cotton was very firm yesterday, and the transaction among fellow traders was quite active, and the selling price was very high. However, the factory fellow traders were very quiet, as were the Japanese manufacturers. The price of the factory was converted at an exchange rate of 6.6875 yuan for American cotton yesterday, as follows:</p>
<p>20 Count American Meter Lin 262.00</p>
<p>Also Subordinate Grade 251.10</p>
<p>32 Count Also 274.50</p>
<p>Also Subordinate Grade 263.70</p>
<p>42 Count Also 278.50</p>
<p>Also Subordinate Grade 263.50</p>

<p>Domestic Cloth: The cloth market this morning opened with a reversal of the ten-day slump, with retail sellers releasing white goods, and asking prices dropping by one dime to two and a half dimes per piece. However, in the afternoon, the exchange rate tightened, and the yarn market rebounded. Cloth prices also followed suit with a ten-dime increase, ultimately resulting in a leveling out with the previous day's closing price. Confidence stabilized, and purchasing interest slightly increased. Local wholesale transactions included over 500 pieces of bleached and dyed cloth and grey cloth. The Ningbo merchants were selling white-ground printed cloth very well. Wenzhou merchants were dealing with over 200 pieces of printed cloth, colored cloth, bleached cloth, coarse and fine cloth. Quanzhou merchants were dealing with over 100 pieces of printed cloth, fancy cotton cloth, bleached cloth, striped bleached cloth, and poplin. Guangdong merchants were also dealing with nearly 100 pieces. Sichuan and Yunnan merchants were dealing with over 6,000 pieces of fine cloth, shirting, blue cloth, and woolen cloth.</p>
<p>Eastern Cloth: Due to the rise in yarn prices, local merchants' purchasing interest intensified again. Fine cloth prices surged by over five dimes per piece in both the morning and afternoon sessions. In the later market, the closing price for top-quality fine cloth was 27.40 yuan, and the futures price for this month was 27.80 yuan. "Four Gentlemen" serge increased to 8.275 dimes per yard, with futures at 8.45 dimes. The total daily transaction volume for fine cloth exceeded 1,000 pieces, and serge also reached 400 pieces.</p>
<p>Exports: Today, 78 pieces of piece goods were shipped to Hong Kong, and 88 pieces were shipped to Haiphong.</p>

<p>Firewood sources have been blocked since last winter by certain parties, obstructing inland rivers. This has not been resolved, causing merchants and travelers to be afraid to procure supplies. Consequently, local stockpiles are dwindling, and prices are becoming increasingly favorable. Large-sized "anti-white" firewood is selling for only 1.5 bundles per yuan, second-grade Siko firewood for 2.4 dimes, small bundles of long firewood for 5 bundles, and old plank firewood for 8 bundles. It is rumored that some goods have arrived at a certain market in Hongkou, but they are mostly poplar wood, which is damp and cannot be used immediately, and the price is not cheap either.</p>

<p>Old News Newly Copied: 67 Years Ago (25th Year) (From this newspaper published in the 12th year of the Tongzhi era of the Qing Dynasty)</p>
<h3 id="e111">Macau (II) <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>Zhang Tian’an’s "Illustrated Treatise on Macau" states: "Initially, all seagoing vessels docked directly below the city of Guangzhou. However, during the Ming Dynasty, due to concerns about Japanese pirates, they were moved to Dianbai in Gaozhou Prefecture. Later, in the 14th year of the Jiajing era, foreign merchants requested permission to enter Macau to sun and dry their goods due to the dampness and humidity caused by wind and rain. Permission was granted, and they were required to pay a tariff of 20,000 taels. This marked the beginning of the presence of foreign chiefs in Macau. In the 29th year of the Wanli era, the Westerner Matteo Ricci entered China and settled in Macau. Afterward, the number of Westerners arriving increased, and other foreign groups gradually withdrew. During the early Qing Dynasty, due to maritime threats, coastal areas were evacuated and taxes were not collected. Westerners instead paid a land rent of 500 taels. This marked the beginning of the Westerners' settlement in Macau." According to the latter account, the presence of foreigners in Macau began in the 14th year of the Jiajing era, not in the early Longqing era. The Portuguese likely arrived in China before the Jiajing era. The "Complete Book of National Diseases" records an incident in the 12th year of the Zhengde era involving a Portuguese ship invading Guangdong. Furthermore, Portugal was the first to explore these lands, so it is unlikely that they would have waited several decades before reaching Guangdong. At that time, there was no land rent. Our dynasty, with its vast heavenly grace, followed a policy of appeasement, mindful of their long voyages across the ocean and distant arrivals by boat. Therefore, they were exempted from taxes, not even requiring trifling amounts. The Portuguese, grateful for the holy grace, desired to reciprocate. However, knowing that the imperial court did not value exotic goods, they did not dare to present even rare items. Instead, they voluntarily paid a land rent of over 500 taels to the local officials annually, considering it a fortunate loan of a branch and an expression of gratitude. This was requested by border officials and approved, so it remained unchanged from the Kangxi era to the Qianlong and Jiaqing eras. Therefore, Macau was initially a place for various Southeast Asian foreigners to display their goods, and later a place for Western countries to reside. The Portuguese paid annual rent, and China received tribute, which had been the case for a long time. However, since the country has been plagued by many misfortunes, border officials no longer care about the small amount of land rent, and the Portuguese have also stopped paying it, which has been the case for over thirty years.</p>

<h3 id="e113">A Word to Working Youth <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>— Ji Fufang</p>
<p>In this distorted development on the isolated island, it is very unsuitable for upright young people. Especially for the majority of working youth, they have lost the constraints of education, and during their spare time, there is no specific work to restrict them from doing. If there is no proper entertainment and recreation, it is inevitable that they will seek out their dissolute life in their spare time.</p>
<p>Around Shanghai, in the so-called "evil lands," gambling dens and opium dens are numerous. Transformed dance halls and vulgar theaters are all seductive nets that lure young people. Stepping into those places is like losing half of one's life.</p>
<p>Well-behaved young people will not automatically run to take risks, but among relatives, friends, and neighbors, there are always those who are good patrons of those places, and they also have a mentality of wanting others to go with them. So, in their conversations, they inevitably exaggerate the situation there, saying that someone made a fortune gambling, or someone spent a few dimes and won hundreds of yuan. Even if you don't gamble, the cigarettes, sweets, and delicacies there are available to eat at will. As for the inside stories of dance halls and theaters, hearing about them makes one's heart itch even more.</p>
<p>Young people are all curious. Having these "strange places" always makes them want to see them for themselves. Initially, they only have the purpose of trying it once, and they also know that they don't have the ability to play there often. But once they get there, their minds become unclear, they become anesthetized. If they don't go there to kill time, their hearts are always uneasy, or if they lose money, they still want to recoup their losses, and if they win money, they want to win more.</p>
<p>Most working youth are not very well-off. At first, some expenses are met with pocket money. After a long time, their ambitions grow, and the small amount is not enough to squander.</p>
<p>Therefore, we see many working youth often neglecting their affairs, frequently taking leave, not getting enough sleep at night, and not being able to invigorate their spirits when working. This is still a minor matter. Even more people misappropriate public funds or owe large sums of money in order to spend money, always resulting in unemployment, decline, and a tarnished reputation... A good young person is completely beyond redemption!</p>
<p>Therefore, I hope that the general working youth should reflect on themselves. The current life is already very difficult, and even if they can barely support themselves, they should still consider the future. Now is a turbulent era. When the new era of construction arrives in the future, will their skills be able to cope? Are they willing to maintain their occupation forever and not seek advancement?</p>
<p>Therefore, I advise the general youth to study a subject at this time to prepare for their future career, or at least they should cultivate a skill.</p>
<p>At present, those places are colorful and have everything, but we should restrain our dissolute hearts.</p>
<p>We should study knowledge, improve our skills, and go to libraries, reading groups, or cram schools in our spare time.</p>
<h3 id="e114">Ways to Make a Living <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>— Lingling</p>
<p>The other day, I went to the ×× Biscuit Factory on ×× Road to buy biscuits. At that time, there was an old foreign lady also buying the same thing. The clerk was really clever. He pressed his finger on the weight on the scale. Of course, the object on this side, due to the technique on the other side, was reduced in weight considerably. When it was my turn, that clerk still used the "way to make a living" method. Because I had already seen it, I asked him to re-weigh it. The trick was exposed, and he had to add more, almost adding five ounces of biscuits.</p>
<p>Even on these biscuits, they use this trick. No wonder the rice weevils who always seek ways to make a living need to use the "attention to rice buyers" trick that Mr. Cheng mentioned in the newspaper the other day. Therefore, in the current era of rising prices, this isolated island is full of this new method of "making a living." I hope gentlemen and ladies will pay attention at all times.</p>
<h3 id="e115">After the Rain, a Clear Sky <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>

<p>Chapter 21: Managing Principles by Mixing Fibers, Promoting Machinery to Aid Literary Achievements</p>
<p>At that time, the two Miss He were having a very pleasant conversation with Jiang Zhenrui. Jiang Jingrong said, "This time in Beiping, I spent a few days with your father and heard that both of you are textile experts. We were happy and initiated this silk weaving factory. Originally, we wanted to have more capital and do it on a large scale, but your father said: 'You are handling things for the first time and have less experience. After you have achieved results, you can expand.' The funds from all parties have already been transferred to my relative, Mr. Ye Songfen's bank. When you two ladies need funds during the establishment, you can withdraw them at any time. I can now hand over the bank drafts and a letter from your father to you two, as well as their plans, opinions, shareholder list, etc." As he spoke, he took out two bank drafts and a letter that Mr. He wrote to his two daughters from a document folder. Jiang Jingrong also said, "I heard that one of you two ladies is going to Europe and America for investigation, which is the best thing. I have been abroad once before, but it was just a brief tour. How can it compare to the years you two ladies have spent abroad, studying in depth? Moreover, the technology in the United States is changing rapidly, and there is often a new invention, which leads to a new change. We are old and decaying, but we have some experience in running silk factories in China. If you two ladies regard me as an old horse that knows the way, I can tell you everything I know." The two Miss He also said, "We are young and inexperienced, and we rely entirely on Uncle Jiang's guidance at all times. We will have to bother you often in the future." Then, Jiang Jingrong kept the two ladies for lunch at the International Hotel before they returned. The discussions during the meal were also nothing more than about silk fabrics. According to Jiang Jingrong, "Modern fabrics are gradually trending towards a mixture, and we can no longer distinguish between silk fabrics, cotton fabrics, wool fabrics, hemp fabrics, and other categories. In short, its principle is the same, just fibers. For example, in the silk factory we are running now, most of the pure raw material is silk, but there is also a lot of rayon mixed in. And many cotton fabric factories also weave fabrics with silk and wool mixed in. The same goes for woolen mills, some with silk, some with cotton, and some with hemp. So, at this moment, it seems that various fabrics are clearly divided, such as silk, cloth, wool, and ramie. I am afraid that in the future, the mixture will be so severe that we will not be able to distinguish them. Fortunately, we are adapting to the times, and we will weave whatever material people like to wear. However, people who wear clothes rarely create new styles themselves. Opening up new trends is the responsibility of the textile manufacturers." (246)</p>
<h3 id="e116">An Absent Student <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>— Qiang Gong</p>
<p>I don't understand the reason why Huang Da has been frequently absent from class recently. Some classmates say he is sick, some say he has gone to the countryside, and some say he has already found a shop and is apprenticing there. But this is not the truth. In any case, a person cannot be sick, go to the countryside, and apprentice at the same time. These are clearly unreliable rumors.</p>
<p>Huang Da does very well in his studies. He is a smart child. He knows the suffering of being out of school, and he knows the necessity of continuing his studies even more. But material things have not helped him, so he has no choice but to find a night school to satisfy his intellectual hunger.</p>
<p>Such a diligent and enterprising child should not be absent from class without a reason. However, I haven't seen Huang Da come to class for two weeks. Is he really sick? Did he really go to the countryside? Did he really enter a business to apprentice? Finally, I also began to doubt. In fact, students at night schools of a supplementary nature come in waves and then disappear without knowing where they went. At the beginning of the semester, the place is full, but at the end of the semester, it is deserted. So why bother caring so much about one Huang Da?</p>
<p>One winter evening, the snow had covered a thin layer. Huang Da, this hardworking child, hurried into the school to attend class. A piece of leftover bread leaked out of his umbrella, and the classmates mocked him. After the first class, this struggling student stood alone next to the sand filter tap, soaking the bread in the sand filter to complete his only dinner.</p>
<p>Later, according to reports from other students, Huang Da's leftover bread was picked up next to the back door of a tall building. He managed to get permission from the head chef and often went there to collect some scraps for dinner. The degree of wind-drying and hardening naturally meant that he had to soak it in tap water. Isn't this child's misfortune even for a meal?</p>
<p>A postcard from a slum address wrote:</p>
<p>"Student Huang Da has been going every day for half a month from 3:00 PM to receive steamed buns on my mother's orders. I have to wait until 6:00 PM to get two small steamed buns, so I cannot come to class. Please forgive me, teacher. I don't know when I will be able to study again. The two small steamed buns are the size of teacups. Eating them is not enough to fill my stomach. My mother said I should receive them, so I have to go. In fact, it doesn't help my stomach... ..."</p>

<p>— A letter from a Woolen Shop Apprentice Regarding the Embezzlement Case</p>
<p>To the Editors of Spring and Autumn: Respectfully, I am an apprentice in an old-fashioned shop. Because I see the heavy darkness in the shop, I am writing to ask you to publish it, so that people in society will know.</p>
<p>I am learning my trade in a shop that sells both wool and rayon. At first, I thought this occupation would fit my ideal. Later I discovered that the wool, rayon, and even knitting needles sold in the shop were all mixed with inferior goods that had been repackaged. At the end of the year, they actually earned more than 559,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Therefore, from now on, I no longer want to pollute my pure heart and do things that betray my conscience. I have decided to leave this dissolute and shameless isolated island as soon as possible and rush to the embrace of the motherland. At the same time, I hope that patriotic compatriots will not unknowingly give money to people you do not want to give it to.</p>
<h3 id="e118">Applied Religion (IV) <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>Every Sunday, we pray, "Thy kingdom come!" What does that mean? It means that there is a world in which there is very little suffering and disease. In which women are respected, children are not forgotten, and the elderly are not abandoned; in which the value of people is more important than machines, and human life is more noble than profit. In other words, there is a society in which the goal is not how much you can earn, but how much you can give and how much you can serve. We are children of God and have a responsibility to help each other. If our religion can focus more on life, and we truly put our beliefs into practice, do you think that there would still be so many people in our society, in the world, on the verge of starvation? I remember visiting a beautifully decorated summer villa in the United States: nurses wearing beautiful uniforms served many dogs, and the houses where the dogs lived were much better than the ones I hoped to buy. There were dance rooms, bedrooms, each with their names written on them. They had exquisite food, scheduled brushing and bathing, private doctors, cooks, and cemeteries. Not far away, there were many slums with unusable houses and no sanitation facilities. This picture of people being worse than dogs made my blood boil. Did Jesus not say, "Truly I tell you, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me"? He sacrificed everything for people and helped people in the community every day to make their lives better, nobler, and cleaner. His religion was daily service and sacrifice. He made himself happy and brought peace to others through his actions. We, as followers of Jesus, must also do this. (End)</p>

<p>— Lin Gong</p>
<p>There was a period in the United States when historical films were popular. Hollywood's eight major companies used all their efforts to collect historical stories and make films. On the one hand, it was to cater to the psychology of the audience, and on the other hand, if a film made with the history of a certain country as its theme had a place to promote the greatness of that country, that country would usually allocate a huge bonus to the company. In order to benefit from both aspects, every producer once spent countless efforts on historical films. After 1937, the film industry suddenly changed, and the audience's attention was focused on war and song and dance films, and historical films lost their original position.</p>
<p>However, some directors, due to the limitations of the script, still occasionally had echoes of filming historical films, such as the recently released "The Crusades," "The War of the Roses," "The Bloody History of Napoleon," "Chapayev," "Mutiny on the Bounty," "The Life of Emile Zola," "A Tale of Two Cities," "The Story of the Sun," and "The Iron Heel," all of which are immortal works of historical films. For a time, the box office success was amazing, and it has indeed exceeded any other type of film, and it is equally supported by the masses in all countries of the world. Therefore, many directors in Hollywood still insist on increasing the filming of historical films, but due to the weak vision of the producers, the only big director in the world film industry who continues to film historical films is Ernst Lubitsch.</p>
<p>According to a recent news report in the American newspaper "St. Louis Post-Dispatch," US President Roosevelt will ask the big director Ernst Lubitsch to direct a film about Columbus's discovery of the New World. The US President has now approved the allocation of US$2 million for the filming fee. If the director's performance can achieve excellent results, there will be another US$1 million bonus. Of course, under the invitation of the US President, how could he not agree? However, because MGM and Paramount will ask Ernst Lubitsch to direct two historical films in the autumn of this year, in order to account for their own business, it is said that they have requested the US government for the filming time of the film to be limited to five months, and it is expected that there will be no problems and it can be resolved smoothly. However, the recent lack of talent for filming historical films is an indisputable fact. Therefore, when signing the contract, Errol Flynn and Fredric March were also dragged along as an attachment. The salary for each person is US$300,000. It is said that Errol Flynn and Fredric March's own companies can also agree to let them go outside to film. The date of the big start of filming is in the near future.</p>

<p>Since the film production atmosphere on the isolated island shifted to the production of historical costume dramas, it is like bamboo shoots after a rain, producing endlessly. This can be said to be a great success for the development of historical costume dramas. However, because historical costume dramas are too prevalent in various theaters, people will inevitably forget their meaning and not feel the direct pain, so it is necessary to change the atmosphere again. Now, some unconscious friends on this isolated island can also use films to awaken them.</p>
<p>At present, speculation is really too rampant, raising the prices of various items to the highest level. The first people to be awakened here are speculators. I think it is very possible to adapt Mr. Mao Dun's "Midnight" for performance. In addition, I hope there will be more literary films, which are most suitable for general students. "Silver Queen Honors" dedicated, and Li Qinian's photos will be given by Shanghai Post Office Box 2020 Film Fan Service</p>

<p>After Wu Cun directed "Wang Baochuan," he returned to Guohua to prepare for his new work, "The Amorous History of Su San." It was originally scheduled to start filming in the middle of last month, but Wu suddenly suffered from a throat ailment and was admitted to the Shilong Hospital for treatment, so it was temporarily shelved. Now I know that Wu has fully recovered and been discharged from the hospital, and "Su San's Amorous History" started filming yesterday. Another new work by Guohua, "Li A Mao and Dongfang Shuo," has been completed after "Hero in Troubled Times."</p>
<p>"Confucius" director Fei Mu and Zhang Yi have recently become very interested in dramas. It is said that they have formed the "China Drama Club," and the first play is scheduled to be "Emperor Gaozu of Han," with the script written by Fei Mu's younger brother Fei Tai.</p>

<p>— Qihua</p>
<p>"Wronged Souls in the Sea of People" is a family tragedy, but this tragedy is latent rather than exposed. Therefore, it may not be as easy to excite the audience as "Cold Night Qin Pick," but on the other hand, those fragmented scenes are exposing the cause of the family tragedy everywhere. When watching Paul Muni's child singing that song in the bathtub, in addition to being moved, it may also make every audience member recall the cause of the tragedy and reflect on themselves.</p>
<p>There are some discords between couples that are superficial, and some that are latent. Edmund Goulding tells us in everyday life how Paul Muni and his wife feel. How does he protect Qin Bailan Yin? He did not waste a scene, but accumulated these many reasons and then exploded them at an appropriate time. As long as we don't feel bored, it is his successful place.</p>
<p>Paul Muni tells us in this play that he is indeed an all-around actor. Qin Bailan Yin and Flavia Robson, who plays Paul's wife, are also excellent.</p>

<p>China's first Buddhist film, "Avalokitesvara," started filming yesterday morning. A consecration ceremony was held at the Guanyin Temple. Yihua attached great importance to this. In addition to respectfully inviting the high monk Chi Song from Shengxian Temple to preside over the ceremony, Wen Lanting, Guan Jiongzhi, Huang Hanzhi, and others were present. All Yihua employees and actors lined up to shoot newsreels. Newcomer Ziwei and lead actress Zhang Cuihong and others wore gray cassocks and worshipped sincerely.</p>
<p>"The Assassin of the King of Qin" is Yan Youxiang's directorial debut. Playwright Ye Gong is also making his debut as a screenwriter. Lead actor Lu Ming is also filming his last film before leaving Shanghai for Hong Kong. Movie fans are very interested in this. It is said that it will be screened after "Peerless Beauty" at "Xin Guang." There will be a test screening before the screening.</p>
<p>When Nanhua Film Queen Li Qinian comes to Shanghai, it is said that she will hold a grand banquet and dance party, which is scheduled to be held at the Xianle or Bailedu. The Shanghai art world has collectively created a "Betty Kai."</p>

<p>Johnny Weissmuller's new work after "Tarzan Finds a Son," which he co-stars with Hallywood Shena, is "Tarzan Seeks a Wife." It is said that the film is a companion piece to "Tarzan Finds a Son." After more than seven months of filming, it will soon be completed. It is also said that in response to the requests of the majority of people in the United States, it has been decided to film one-half of the film in color, so it is expected that the film will be even more sensational when it is released.</p>
<p>Fu Yunhu's Zhaiqu Tales</p>
<h3 id="e126">Introducing Fu Yuntai <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>— Su Shaoqing</p>
<p>Miss Fu Yuntai has been studying Lao Sheng opera with me for three years. Her aptitude is good, and she is quite diligent. She can perform nearly thirty operas. Her inner energy is abundant, surpassing that of men. Her voice is high and she is initially accustomed to the Ban Diao style, but she is now developing other styles. She sings both joyful and melancholy tunes with ease. Fortunately, her voice is high but not narrow. She can sing two or three major operas in a row without exhaustion, and she barely needs to drink water. Her voice is truly rare among women. Peking opera originated in rural areas and originally emphasized high-pitched sounds, valuing the ability to stir the spirit of the masses. However, in the last thirty years, voices have become increasingly weak. Is this good for the country and society? We should return to our roots, advocating and promoting vigorous tones to meet the needs of the new nation and the new people. However, deeply ingrained habits are hard to change, and customs are difficult to transform. While I have this aspiration, I lack the exceptional voice to achieve it, leading to nothing but empty words, regret, and shame, which has been the case for more than just a day. In the past, I had hoped to educate talented individuals with my knowledge to realize my ideals and help the opera world achieve a restoration of order. I have encountered probably thousands of young people. Some have the looks, physique, and intelligence suitable for a Lao Sheng role, but those with truly exceptional voices are as rare as phoenixes. Without an excellent voice, it is difficult to even cope, let alone talk about being high-pitched. Three years ago, while I was talking about opera on the radio, I happened to meet Miss Fu Yuntai. In addition to her voice, she also possesses other qualities: a long, square face, large, long eyes, and a medium-tall build, all of which are suitable for a Lao Sheng role. Moreover, she has an upward-striving spirit, without mournful tones, which aligns with my ideals. Perhaps she will be the one to restore high-pitched tones in the future. She will be performing at the Huang Gong Theatre for three days, performing "Catching and Releasing Cao," "Fish Intestine Sword," and "Empty City Stratagem and Beheading Ma Su." If she continues to perform, then the "Second Visit to the Palace" and "Ascending to Heaven Terrace" from the Wang Jiuling school, and the "Wen Zhao Pass" and "Conceding Chengdu" from the Han Guifen school, will be offered in succession. Her skills are limited and her experience is shallow. Her word pronunciation is not yet fully correct, and her acting is not yet proficient. I sincerely hope that experts from all over the country will correct and support her, and give her strict criticism. That would be very fortunate indeed.</p>
