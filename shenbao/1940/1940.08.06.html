<h3 id="c2">英日緊張之展望 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>英日兩國國交，近日突見緊張：且激盪未已，頗有更趨尖銳之觀。此在國際大局中。極關重要之又一環，甚可注意者也。蓋於上週間，日本當局以檢舉外國諜報嫌疑之理由之下，大舉逮捕英僑後，致有墮樓死者；英國輿情激昂，或主報復。近三日，英國之倫敦，曁各屬地如新加坡，海峽殖民地，緬甸，香港等處，以違反國防有關各種條例之理由之下，逮捕日僑，迄昨日所得消息爲止，已捕十名；英國當局宣稱，事屬日常事務，並非報復云。此所刺激日方朝野者，如何强烈。自在英國意料中，然而英國毅然爲之；美國視此爲英國態度之轉强，意外之表示，抑亦日人之意外哉！</p>
<p>自歐戰爆發後，英國對日本，委屈求全；凡日方所求，輒不顧國內外之訾議責難，甚至敝屣國際道義，條約義務，以遷　日本；如天津英租界中國存銀問題之讓步，緬甸對華暫時停運之協定，其尤著者也。日本遂以英國爲可侮，反英運動時見高昂。近衛組閣後，蔑英更甚；言國策，則暗示排擠之於東亞之外；言外交，則列述對德義美蘇之願望而語不齒英；御用言論則公然指斥，比爲敵國；近衛登台二旬，一事未舉，先捕英僑。本報前嘗論之：謂日本對國際，亦在徬徨中，捕英僑乃所以測騐英德兩方之反應；又謂英國如何反應，端視英國對自身之國力與榮譽如何估價；及至今茲，無論英國不以逮捕日僑爲報復行動，</p>
<p>以國際之幻變不常，近年之風雲險惡，任何人無以斷言於英日交惡，將如何歸宿。若昨今日方高唱之種種說法；召回駐英大使，與英斷絕外交關係；以有效手段，作迅速行動；以暴行對付暴行；又如義大利報紙所傳東京消息，謂將自海陸兩面，同時封鎖香港。凡此數者，皆極尋常；縱使日方反應之强烈更甚於此，亦未可視爲意外。雖然，觀察全局，英日國交殆尙未至重要確定之時機。就英國方面言：當緬甸停運問題談判之際，以及協定簽訂之後，繼續從事於撒退香港婦孺，可見對於日本夙具戒心，且示其不再讓步之決心；此次明知日方必有强烈之反應，而猶逮捕日僑，決非防務條例忽爾嚴厲施行，亦非各地日僑忽爾同時違反條例，是又可見英國至近衛內閣所表示者而讓無可讓，忍無可忍矣。無可讓，無可忍，顧豈遽有積極作爲？在此德義方竭全力準備進攻英國之前夕，英國亟務在彼；是以英國對於雙力捕僑之糾紛，必視爲隨時可告結束之獨立問題，雖意義與行動上合有確是報復之重大嫌疑，亦必即此報復爲止。質言之，英國若非再自日本方面遭遇何種新壓迫，新侮辱，新挑釁，則對日本必靜止於觀望，同時亦戒備不懈。</p>
<p>就日本方面言；逮捕英僑之意義，在於親德侮英之兩重測騐，然其主觀對於兩種比重之孰高孰下，當爲局外人所無從懸測。分別推之，重在侮英之測騐，則日本目前苦於無法結束對華侵略，實無餘力對英挑戰，故至今日英國表示其確臻忍無可忍之程度，日本對英亦即憚於再作何種事實上輕侮，惟空言叫囂，外交攻勢，自有所不能已耳。不若是而重在親德之測騐，則僅此捕僑問題，必猶不足爲獲致德國信任之贄，何况英國之反應强硬逾恒，尤使日人失色。然則日本於不至挑戰之限度之內，對英必作更進幾步之作爲，始爲德國所欣然頜首乎？日本準備之乎？決行之乎？非曰必無其日，顧非所語於今茲；何也，今茲之日本猶不能對英挑戰也。日本戰英，非俟中日戰爭之結束，即俟英國抗德之大敗。</p>
<p>英日兩方情勢，除因美蘇或有何種新行動，或予何種新影響外，大致若是，故曰國交尙未至重要確定之時機。自今日以迄其備具確定條件爲止、期間久暫不可知。在此期間，英國若能把握此讓無可讓，忍無可忍之最後關頭，則捕僑糾紛雖如此，但恐嚇威脅之風，或可稍戢歟！</p>

<p>本文作者的翰費休John　Fisher係美國Life畫報駐柏林訪員，德軍進攻法蘭德斯之役，曾偕第一批訪員隨軍出發。經荷蘭比利時而至法國北部，然後循英吉利海峽至鄧扣克附近，其時德軍正在轟擊，乃折入比國北部而至白魯塞爾。於鄧扣克陷落後數小時，趕至該港。其原文譯錄於後：</p>
<p>各報隨軍記者，分乘高速度軍用汽車七輛，自科侖出發。一行在比利時邊境要邑馬斯特列克渡末斯河。各橋樑已被比軍炸毀，惟德軍工兵隊已在二十四小時之內，架起鐵橋兩座。德軍並已在城中張貼佈吿，吿誡居民，在夜間十時後不得出戶，免被巡邏隊槍殺。</p>
<p>末斯河沿岸，難民扶老携幼重返故鄕，德軍軍用車多輛則開足速率，向前疾駛。列日居民食糧已受限制。及至那穆爾，戰事漸猛烈。沿途地雷不時觸發，吾人乃避公路而行。那穆爾北部房屋殆已全毀。</p>
<p>由沿途情形觀之，此次戰爭係以公路爲戰塲。德軍梅塞斯密特轟炸機，循公路低飛以機關槍掃射聯軍隊伍，但所擲炸彈多不落於公路。那穆爾南，余見公路兩旁一百五十英尺外，彈痕壘壘，達數英里，路面雖多彈片，但絕無損壞情形。據德軍官吿余：「轟炸路旁，效力相若，炸毀公路豈不妨礙行軍。」比國所造公路，無不結實異常，徒供德軍機械化部隊得以每小時三四十英里之速率，疾駛無阻。</p>
<p>路旁士兵墳墓寥寥可數。德軍對於陣亡士兵，輒在數小時內，卽行埋葬，以防疫癘，並避免生存者目擊弟兄們捐軀慘狀。</p>
<p>是日嚮晚，吾人駛過馬奇諾防綫。該處防禦工事係以馬保奇鎭爲中心，其前掘有堅强之戰壕，各街道則置有鐵絲網等障礙物。德軍以大批戰車飛機及大隊機械化步兵向之集中轟擊者　三日之久。最後始由斯杜加轟炸機十五架於十五分鐘之內予以擊破。該鎭居民二萬五千人，全部房屋已成瓦礫塲，但所有街道並無一處被炸，可知德軍轟擊猛烈而準確矣</p>
<p>該鎭有老嫗兩人，正在瓦礫塲中，翻尋傢具，據吿余，教堂中一彈，罹難者的有難民五十人。兩婦神情恍忽，舉動失常，德軍斯杜加轟炸機，恐怖威力之大，可見一斑。此種轟炸機所擲炸彈落下時，發出銳厲巨聲，刺耳可怕。該鎭屍體所發出之惡臭及血腥，猶甚充斥，德軍官謚之爲「戰役之香氣。」</p>
<p>及至加蒂隆，遇英法俘虜一萬五千人，其中有英國蘭開斯特步兵一連。據連長稱，德軍會以戰車三百輛及迫擊重砲多尊，猛烈進攻，該連死傷百分之二十五。「此種損失，係司令部指揮無方所致，吾則弟兄們儘可及時調開。」該軍突然作戰，配備甚不充分，致在烈日之下，行軍三日，食物飲水，兩感缺乏。惟法軍配備甚完全，且備有營帳。</p>
<p>該軍官最後　謂，「三日之內？　未見　我國空軍光臨，且未得機開放一砲。及至德軍戰車迫近，有機射擊矣，法軍官又恐英軍砲火不準確，誤傷法國步兵之故，禁止轟擊」。余以德軍如何爲問。據答　，「德軍善戰，弟兄們竟不知如何應付，歸國後報吿某某大員。」該軍官緊握斧柄，且言且揮曰，「一切爲政客所誤！」</p>
<p>由余觀之，　軍士氣仍　，戰鬥力亦不惡，但拘留情形，不無令人沮喪。每四人僅分　麵包一個，無怪其向余等爭索捲菸麵包矣。若輩中有在小河岸旁洗滌衣服者，亦有以樹枝生火，烤煮殘餘罐　頭食物者</p>
<p>車行過阿拉斯，其地車站及市中心區，均已爲砲火所毀。續向波洛業前進，沿途堆積聯軍遺下六吋砲　數千發。英　　載重汽車，改漆顏色，代德軍運輸軍需，絡繹於途。其間雜以機器脚踏東隊上　機關槍，並有載重車多輛滿載步兵，趾高氣揚，向前疾駛，勝軍與敗兵，榮辱眞不可同日而語。</p>
<p>德軍此種機械化部隊每小時飛奔四十英里，沿途撞毀車輛絕無僅有。余甚異之，乃詢德軍官「何術致此。」彼大駭，答曰「撞車有違軍令。」</p>
<p>波洛業各碼頭已粉碎，所有堆棧類皆燬成平地。聯軍遺棄軍需拋散　地。並有酒桶數百，可見法軍不可一日無此君。旋沿岸上駛，經加萊及聖沃美而至加塞爾，其地居高臨下，置有大砲及高射砲數尊，載重車鐵甲車，　望皆是，軍火酒瓶罐頭食物堆積滿地。垃圾堆中且有足球鞋，箭靶及其他遊嬉玩具，海口一帶英軍配備之應有盡有，較之內地，真有天淵之別。</p>
<p>波洛斯爲鄧扣克最後防區，吾人駛近其地，乃相率下車步行，探路前進，時德軍斯杜加轟炸機羣正圖衝過法軍高射砲阻隔砲火，吾人駐足而觀，第見砲彈在機尾暴裂，小塊白烟距機尾甚近，但未見中的。</p>
<p>旋乃循鐵路軌魚貫前進。旣入波格斯，見有載重車，　車及其他各式車輛，係匆促推入路口，權作障碍，但巳無效。城門由一美國製巨大輪轉掃雪車堵塞，其後有法軍機關槍手所遺下之剩餘膳食，蓋已未及終了卽行撤退矣。余側身擠人城，望去盡是一片殘破。德軍斯杜加轟炸機及大砲轟擊者凡四日，所有房屋無一倖存，瓦礫堆中，餘燼猶未完全熄滅，焦木及焚餘布匹烟氣使人窒息。教堂有安然無恙者，有塔頂被擊毀者。德軍砲彈不時猶在上空穿過，地面則聞法德兩軍機關槍聲軋軋呼應。北望可見焚燒中之鄧扣克，濃烟蔽天。</p>
<p>行經波格斯街道，到處見有居民自地窟中匍匐而出。該城被攻六日中，困守城內者的有二千人。旋見法軍被炸戰車一輛，其旁有戰馬數匹，俯首食草，狀頗優閒。德軍所獲戰利品，如捲菸，朱古律糖，其他食物，足敷六個月之用，所護軍火亦有數百萬發。</p>
<p>德軍猶在猛烈轟擊鄧扣克，吾人乃自波格斯南下至黎爾。該城近郊亦已全毀，惟市中心區尙完好。亞斯附近見有法軍俘虜數千，圍以鐵絲網，監視者僅德兵一名而已。</p>
<p>深夜入比京，除橋樑無綫電台被炸毀外，絕無何種毀壞情形。路旁咖啡館生意鼎盛，顧客多德兵。電車公共汽車已照常行駛。美國製捲烟日見稀少。麵包購買已受限制。各街道盡成德軍世界，居民雖感不快，但德軍行爲尙不惡，戰勝者與被征服者之間因尙相安。至於比王下令停戰一事，比國輿論可以一言概括之，卽「在情感上認爲不當，但在理智上亦表贊同」。</p>
<p>翌晨冉向北行，卽晚宿於奧斯頓。天明循海岸向鄧扣克進發。路見德軍軍需列車絡繹開回後方，宛如長蛇。據軍中消息，鄧扣克戰事殆已結束。沿莫伊勒運河驅車前進，河中見有駁船多艘正在焚燒，田中則有聯軍載重車排列成行，一望無際。遺棄之配備給養滿坑滿谷。法軍退却時曾將莫伊勒運河決閘灌水，鄧扣克附近一片在洋，德軍戰車因乃無法運用，進攻時不得不以步兵砲兵爲主。德兵涉水而過，水深沒胸。</p>
<p>鄧扣克被德飛機大砲猛烈轟擊者凡七晝夜。吾人於法軍後衛四萬人投降後數小時卽履其地。目擊破壞情形最爲慘酷，所有房屋無一完壁。各街道堆積瓦礫高及數呎。逃往四鄕之難民未幾卽巳絡續歸來。郊外則有大隊德軍向南開拔。某軍官吿余曰，「此間戰事已結束，吾人正在另覓新戰塲」。余以戰爭極度破壞情形到處皆然，無足留戀，乃偕旅伴驅車回柏林。</p>

<p>英美煙公司大量結進</p>
<p>晨初以匯兌、英對美滬等均平、對法無市、美對英跌半分、對滬小二分、對法無市、中央掛牌各匯如舊、銀行農開現貨賣價、英金三辦士八一二五、美匯五元八一二五、較之上週六收、英美兩匯俱平、開後英美煙公司首有結款、市面告緊、計進美行九月份美匯五元七五、又八月份美匯由五元八一二五、做至六五六二五、匯豐掛牌九時三十分揭曉、英匯不更、美匯掛緊〇六二五、為五元六八七五、此後港電亦來扒入九月份英金、計華行東亞塞予價三辦士七三四三七五、嗣雖一度微硬、而不久華商投機家忽猛納至力、而日行亦來補空、緊勢愈俏、初華商及日行進外行八月份美匯為五元六八七五與六五六二五、後向華行東亞買入同月美匯竟縮至五元六二五、且賣戶奇缺、外行供意亦淡、潛勢仍軟、匯豐掛牌十一時二十分第二次揭曉、英江改懸三辦士六二五、美匯五元半、計英緊一二五、美又軟一八七五、他如呂荷日等匯一致掛縮、延年午收、英金告三辦士七一八七五、美匯五元六二五、比晨開英美各軟〇九三七與一八七五、期貨亦緊、</p>

<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤市況、起伏擴大、走勢漲後仍回、枱面熱鬧中、多空活動異常、高漲之原因、乃匯市緊況愈俏、人心當一致向上、晨初五千五百七十元、開後一度微落、而未幾金號等來進、卽升至五百九十五元、後匯市報硬、仍復跌至五千五百三十五元、終以證券幫猛吸、錢兌業空戶思抵、買風頓盛、漲達五千六百四十五元、午收為五千六百二十五元、而聞其中天津幫時有吐塞、午後開出、人心仍好、且港幫狂撈、由五千六百三十元、再升至五千六百七十五元、嗣以證券幫銀號多頭售出、回小至五千五百九十元、收盤前復為金號所進、重出五千六百元關外、但一般浮戶當日了結之心、油然而生、群　求售、故收盤價衹五千五百七十五元、較上周末軋漲六十五元、全天交易約近三千兩、銀樓飾金先漲後跌、海關金等仍平、</p>
<p>烚赤好六十五元</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）、初以匯市報緊、人心堅挺、開市卽狂抬六十元、首由銀號進證券幫三十兩、為五千五百七十元、嗣因某銀號吐出、曾回挫、金號互做十兩、遜為五千五百六十元元、終因證券幫猛扒、雖斯時某錢兌不時供塞、奈另一錢兌業補空急切、故遂又升起三十五元、達五千五百九十五元、後以五千六百元限價賣戶眾多、漲勢被阻、且不久匯市突報轉硬、引起賣風、證券幫亦反有吐出、而津幫聞亦向市拋售、一度曾退至五千五百三十五元、旋外匯重告走緊、買勢頓強、證券幫銀號及錢兌業先後狂撈、未幾卽哄起一百十元、金號進錢兌業二十兩、為五千六百四十五元、午刻買風稍息、證券幫銀號忽來復吐、重又退至五千六百十元、收盤前金號買進再抬十五元、收盤前金號買進再抬十五元、收市為五千六百二十五元、午後開市卽高五元、銀號進金號十兩、為五千六百三十元、繼因外匯續緊、且加港幫暗中吸收、遂一度創見五千六百七十五元新近最高價、後銀號暨證券幫多頭大量出籠、而錢兌業亦跟　吐賣、且匯市回硬價遂回至五千五百九十元、三時許金號及散戶稍扒、曾再升至五千六百二十元、但不意斯時謠傳英日有衝突之說、故賣風再起、證券幫錢兌業吐售尤多、致晚收僅告五千五百七十五元、結果比上周末尚提升六十五元、收後賴某錢兌業維持、最後做至五千五百八十元、全天一百四十元上落、現金號之本牌金售出價、照烚赤較高十數元、收進減低三十元、現標金照掛牌金低五十餘元、均鮮做開、</p>

<p>證券暗盤、昨日市況繼續趨堅、人心愈見強盛、以美國對日強硬、英日磨擦愈甚、市價除息後之行市、以與連息時除息比已較為高、一般人認為不久可有與連息同等價格之希望、以市場人氣及空方壁壘頗高測之、並非不可能之事、昨甲種已穿出一元、乙種已穿出二元、戊種已逼近五十元關、形勢頗為良好、同時金子雖步漲、而債市並不受其威協、因皆係空頭太多之關係也、昨上下午兩市、其市價完全逐步緩緩上騰、觀買賣各戶之堪之以注意者、乃三十八號專買甲種、此以其抽籤帶近關係也、公茂專收乙種此以其比較為賤也、丙種為協大抬高、因市幾與丁種相埒、丁種最為十六號所垂青、全日收買始終不懈、四號收買戊種、乃其一貫宗旨、其余零星收買者不計、賣出方面、甲種為裕興及五源所供給、乙種為鴻康及零星散戶多方所出脫、丙種賣出為同裕及散戶、丁戊兩種為積記及大康成所賣出、一日市價競爭多方仍係優勢、結果各債均回上一二角至五角半不等、成交總數共計一百二十萬元左右、茲列簡明表於後、</p>

<p>昨日眾業股市　隍不定、波動尺度擴大、成交尚形可觀、開盤趨勢不堅、　因匯市一再報緊、各股價格約略回上、但下午賣風忽又轉盛、市況再度跌落、收盤價為一日中之最低者、大概政治局勢之不定、為股市趨軟之主要原因、除非此種局勢能有轉機、一時難望其有多大改進、</p>

<p>紗市趨堅、且漲風復起、此因久遠　默之外匯、縮風驟起、於是引起投機者活動、市盤仍逐步前進、但香港幫因交通不暢、實銷滯鈍、所以漲風被其阻一步、不過投機商一致年漲矣、</p>

<p>油市在徘徊之狀態下、轉呈迂回前進之格、刻下大局照一般人心觀察、頗有腳地、原因傳花生油在產地有法商問津、市價陡生、致申市轉榮、故枱面上進多出少、至於豆油市面、亦稍少帶起、統計成交膠州生油二百件、價為六十四元至六十四元五角、煙臺生油五十件、價為六十四元、青島生油五十桶、價為九十一元五角、及膠州豆七十件、價為六十五六元、青歧豆油五十件、價為六十六元五角、大連豆油二百桶、價為九十三元、</p>

<p>淫戲之害，甚於淫書。淫書則文理通達者能看，淫戲則賢愚皆被所害。如讀書子弟，朗咏夕吟，一看淫戲，攻苦由此拋而慾念而此起矣。富貴子弟，履厚席豐，一看淫戲，家產由此消而元精由此喪矣。農夫出作入息，寒暑不辭，一看淫戲，田地荒而精力疲矣。商人握算持籌，經營慘淡，一看淫戲，錢財輕而生意脫矣。淑女待字，白璧無瑕，一看淫戲，而春心挑動玉樓前結鶯哥緣矣。寡婦守志，勁節流芳，一看淫戲，而春色惱人珠簾下傷燕子飛矣。賤而至</p>
<p>於僕婦，琴瑟久懸，一看淫戲，託燒香點燭爲名。而禍生一旦矣。苦而至於婢女，父母早離，一看淫戲，借淇上桑中之處而醜露白端矣。尼姑本淸修持誦，已謝塵緣，一看淫戲，念佛聲幾爲賣花聲矣。和尚木勢利乖張，亦干例禁，一看淫戲，誦經樓變爲望春樓矣。甚至祝萬壽而點淫戲，敬神明而點淫戲，禍害何日可已！想樂善君子，點演戲文，自有積福之處，彼愛點淫戲者，其好看乎？其害人乎？</p>

<h3 id="c118">撤謊的必要 <a href="#c118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>— 編者</p>
<p>在一次討論兒童撒謊問題的談話中，我們發現了兩個過去所沒有注意到的事實：</p>
<p>我們發覺家境與兒童的撒謊有連帶的關係。從窮苦家庭出身的兒童，撒謊的比從寬裕的家庭出來的兒童多。我們硏究結果，曉得這並不是因爲窮苦的孩子比較不道德，而是這個不平的社會，增加了他們撒謊的必要。</p>
<p>還有一件可驚的事實，是女孩子撒謊的次數平均比男孩子多。這當然也不是因爲女孩子的道德力量不及男孩子的緣故。據我們猜想，這也許又是因爲在這男性中心的社會上，女子的社會地位比男子低，因此增加了她們撒謊的必要。</p>
<p>我們覺得兒童的撒謊，並不能說是一種罪惡，而且根本上也不是一個道德問題，而是一個心理與兒童教育的問題。</p>
<p>在發覺自己年幼的子女撒謊的時候，不必手足無措，也不必大驚小怪。祇要鎮靜地追尋其撒謊的原因，若無其事地硏究其撒謊的心理，然後再決定應付的方策。</p>
<p>兒童的撒謊，責任往往不是在無知的他們的身上；子女的撤謊，時常是要歸咎於做父母與家長的人的。</p>
<p>我們要盡量减少兒童撒謊的必要。</p>
<p>修養</p>
<h3 id="c119">自制的力量 <a href="#c119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>— 曹佑</p>
<p>在日常的生活中，我們往往發覺朋友間相結爲仇，夫妻仳離，家庭失歡，常常却是由一兩句不能自制的話產生出來的。雖然是幾句看來無關重要的話，但有時却是一種嚴重的打擊！我們如要免除產生各種不必要的悲劇，那我們各人對於自己的行爲言語，是必須加以自制的。</p>
<p>當你閱讀偉人名傳時，你自然會發覺着，許多歷史中偉大的人物，在年少的時候，因爲缺乏了自制的力量，致受到很大的打擊，吃了許多的苦頭。但是後來因痛改前非，結果一言一語都出自心腑，各種行爲均加以自制，卒達到人品高尙的地步，受到大衆的擁戴，成爲歷史偉大人物，美國的林肯正是一個顯著的例子。由此我們亦可以知道，自制的力量實在不是與生俱來，却是由於訓練所致。德國偉大的詩人哥德說：我要做我的主人。」眞的，你可使自己成爲一個忍耐知足的人，但同時你也可以使也能自己成一個怨謗與不安的人。我們各人可以發展自己的個性，使成爲快樂的個性。但你使自己的心志成爲不健全的。世界上沒有一個人的性情，不需要注意克制，也沒有一個性情是壞的，祇要加以教化，就會變成好的性情。</p>
<p>一個有着高尙的道德觀念，能够常常自制的人，大部份是基於年少時家庭的訓練，其他如身心的康健，良好的友伴，高深的教育亦是重要的因素。所以那些爲人父母的人，應該用合理的方法，來教導自己的兒女，使他們養成忍耐，和平，知足，更應把他們的身心，保養得和諧康健，應該使他們明白，一個淸凈的生活，善良的心地，和藹的快樂，遠勝醫生的藥劑！</p>
<p>自制的力量對於那些從商或走政治生涯的人，有着極大的效力。經營商業的人，假如沒有自制的力量，休想得到成功！一個成功的商人，往往是一位有着忍耐，良好脾氣的人，假如沒有自制，怎樣會有忍耐呢？走上政治生涯的人，假如自己沒有自制，休想叫人服從他。唯有那些能管束自己的，然後有資格去管理命令他人！</p>
<p>自制的力量，可說是誰人都必須的。在聲色充滿的都市裏，假如沒有自制，靑年就很容易誤入歧途，喪失人格，損害生命！世界上唯有那些有自制的人，纔能踏上成功之路。</p>

<h3 id="c120">古暗的生活 <a href="#c120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>— 藍靛</p>
<p>該是爲了這一度香港的緊張吧！我又憶起了不少疏遠了的朋友，你，也是那疏淡友情里的一個吧！</p>
<p>生活還好嗎？——別了這久了，是免不了要這樣地叩問的。</p>
<p>在我，日子眞的像一條汚濁的河，遲緩地流過去，生活；就在這里面了，如同一堆汚爛的泥團。我眞的不想吿訴給朋友，尤其是隔了個漫長的　子沒有一點兒信息的故人去星述自己的生活，不過，倒可以告訴你的；比起往前的日子來，我康健得多了，僅是這個，你會感到欣慰嗎？</p>
<p>可是，連自己也相信了，在這整個悠長的歲月里，生活是古暗的啊！</p>
<p>我有一些煩惱，一些渴望，和一些向着遙遠的南國的戀慕，你不會相信我有着這些煩惱，渴望和戀慕嗎？眞的，連自己都在懷疑着了，每一個日子，我爲着失去了一顆動搖了信仰的心激起了煩惱，我也爲着追求一顆更美善的信仰而渴望，還有，免不了和久違了南國的景色和故友們帶來一些戀慕，尤其是她，我們底蘇菲亞，現在，她該是很快活吧！</p>
<p>會厭惡又翻弄你的舊話嗎？前一年，會在你的一封信里這末說：「這是一個受難的時代，我們是靑年，生活，是艱難而複雜的功課。」如今，我們可仍在這個受難的時代吧？我却感到一些不舒適的安逸，人們全在高興享受着了。這並不像一個受難的時代，（是嗎？）我們該還是年輕的吧！然而，生活，在我却並不是艱難和複雜的功課，倒如同一個平安的夢，日子，一天，跟着又來了一天，都從汚濁的河底流過去，生活，沒有活潑，沒有歡笑，祗是古宇的單調和古暗的啊！</p>
<p>你會不會因此關心到我呢？</p>
<p>只是你沒會到過這個「孤島」的天堂，無數顆靑年的心都是變得冰冷冷的了。</p>
<p>就相信了吧！許多靑年都這樣；失掉了溫暖的生命里，他們也有着一些煩惱，一些渴慕，和一些向着遙遠的遠方祖國的戀慕。</p>
<p>日子，會照這樣流過去的，生活，也是一樣，但是日子會不會把我們鍛鍊堅强起來？你相信？在黑暗的暴風雷雨里將會閃出一條電光來嗎？一定的。</p>
<p>那末，我們的生活不是永遠困在古暗中的了。</p>

<p>第四章　幾種推想</p>
<p>「昨天半夜以後，大概是一點　光景，所以算今天亦可以·先生，他是什麼樣人？我們也很覺他很奇怪。他　了什麼事？」</p>
<p>霍桑並不答覆他的問句，衹自顧自問：「你覺得他怎樣奇怪？」</p>
<p>「他咋夜冒雨回來，一回來便收拾行李，付淸了賬出去。我給他拿皮包，他也不要。他自己提了皮包到電梯間去。因此我覺得他的行動有些兒異樣。」</p>
<p>我覺得心房的跳動增加了速度。因爲那茶房不單證實了趙伯雄的面目，又證實了他昨夜裏的行動的確有行兇的可能。在無意中得到了這意外的情報，我怎禁得住暗暗歡喜？</p>
<p>霍桑又進一步地問道：「他臨走時的神氣可有些兒慌張？」那茶房張大了眼睛，點頭說：「是的，的確慌張！他回來以後，一言不發，祇顧整理他的皮包；整理好了就走。我早就疑心他不是路道。」</p>
<p>「那末，他搬到什麼地方去，你也不知道嗎？」</p>
<p>「當然不知。我問他可要叫汽車，他也祇搖搖頭，不說一句說話。先生，他到底幹的什麼事？我早就疑心他。」</p>
<p>「喔，你早就疑心他？爲什麼？」這時有個穿長袍，戴呢精，留黑鬚和戴眼鏡的大腹賈模樣的男子，大搖大擺地從甬道東端走過來。那茶房似乎有些顧忌，向霍桑弩一弩嘴，便向着西端的轉灣處走去。我們當然跟隨他走那西端出口的轉折處比較僻靜些，他扌低聲回答。</p>
<p>「先生，有好幾件事使我疑心。他雖一個人住在這裏，來看他的朋友却不少——」</p>
<p>「都是些什麼樣人？」</p>
<p>「這個我記不淸楚，穿中裝的跟西裝的都有，不過年紀都不很大。」</p>
<p>「有女朋友嗎？」</p>
<p>「有——有一個，還會在這裏住過夜。」　（六七）</p>

<h3 id="c122">印度的最高學府 <a href="#c122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>— 陶</p>
<p>印度的聖狄尼格東大學位在聖狄尼格東地方，校長就是現在的印度詩聖太戈爾。牠從前不過是一個小學罷了，後來經過了太戈爾數十年的經營，遂成爲今日世界聞名的印度最高學府。</p>
<p>這大學裏，是沒有教室的；學生們都住來樹林中，一堆一堆的小屋裏。他們大家數十人組織了一個團體，選一個人做他們的隊長。早晨鈴聲一響，他們立刻起身，向太陽致敬，然後在香蕉樹下洗浴，過了半小時，穿上了白色的長袍，把　本用一塊白布包好，向預選的樹下跑去。那裏就是他們上課的教室，而且教授們早巳坐在樹下等待學生們的光臨了。學生到齊之後，排成一個半圓形，大家　踞地上，在鳥語花香之中，上起課來。最奇怪的，就是在上課的時候，如果學生有什麼問題，不必要在讀本上的，都可以打斷教授而立起來問先生，而先生們亦盡量的回答。學生這種鹵莽的舉動，非但不受責罰，並且可以得到先生的讚語。</p>
<p>星期三是他們的禮拜天，所以到了這個日子，學生們都穿上了各色的長砲，歡天喜地的跑到廟裏來做禮拜。他們大家赤了脚，坐在地板上，校長太戈爾坐車子到了廟門口，也脫去草鞋，穿長袍而進，先坐在板凳上做了奇特的儀式，再讀聖經，然後再把聖經的詞句評解給學生聽。</p>
<p>現在聖狄尼格東大學已有學生八百餘人，畢業後在世界各地二十八個國家，做事而畢業後住在印度本地的，亦已分佈到一千個村落左右了！</p>

<h3 id="c124">被認為影片之謎的　「獨裁者」攝製瑣記 <a href="#c124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>— 舒芒</p>
<p>三年慘淡經營終於完成　刻劃入微令人啼笑皆非</p>
<p>卓別麟的新片「獨裁者」，我們耳聞了好久，可是在這遙遙的時期中，却祇是「只聞扶梯響，不見人下來」。使全世界的開明的影迷們，大家都望眼欲穿。直到最近，方扌由卓別麟親目宣佈該片現已完全攝竣，在九月中旬司在美國獻映了。這一張影片，卓別麟動員了全體的攝影塲工作人員，從影星以至工匠，慘淡經營，達三年之久，其中不僅在工作上化去了無數心血，卽在環境上，也遭到不少困難。就目下此時此地的情形與該片的內容上看來，上海的觀衆們，也許是難以看到這張影片的了。現在把關於該片的內容以及一切攝製上所未經人道的瑣事，記述一點在下面，也許是大家所願意知道的。</p>
<p>（一）關於這張影片的題名，現在已決定正式採用「大獨裁者「（The　Great　Dictator）。可是在卓別麟的攝影塲中，大家都不叫牠的題名，而稱之爲「第六部出品」（Prodnction　No.6）的。</p>
<p>（二）卓別麟在道張片子中是全部開口的，他演的是影射希特勒的小鬚子角色，名叫Adenoids　Hinp，意義是「腺狀贅物」，而演　索里尼的賈克奧凱，則在影片中名爲Benzino　gasoline。意義是「石油與戤士林（汽油）」也便是「引火物」，「闖禍坯」的意思。</p>
<p>（三）除了希特勒與墨索里尼外，餘如郭培爾，戈林等人也都出塲，並且都各有妙不可言的影射假名。至於史太林，在片中並不出塲，也未有影射，那原因，據卓別麟解釋，是爲了找不到面貌與他相似的人的緣故。</p>
<p>（四）賀萊高黛仍是本片中的女主角，她演的是一個歌壇女伶，後來做了希特勒的情人。</p>
<p>（五）在三年的攝製過程中，卓別麟共接到了某方人的恐嚇信五百餘次，以及他種恐嚇方式多次。爲了這一點，所以全片工作人員，自卓別麟以下，都保有相當數額的意外險。攝影塲週圍除僱用武裝保護之外，絕對不許仟何人入內參觀。這除了防止意外的原因以外，據說還有「生意眼」作用在內。</p>
<p>（六）卓別麟對於本片的劇照，廢片，以至攝製消息等封鎖得極爲嚴厲，在未經正式公映之前，絕對不許讓關於這張影片的片影隻字洩漏到外間去。</p>
<p>（七）卓別麟對於這部影片的努力，是超出他過去所演的任何各片的，他不但自編，自導，自演，並且連全片的音樂配音，也都是他自己的創作。</p>

<p>我們知道每一個女人的成功爲明星，與她的體態是有莫大關係的。至少在她的某一部份必須具有理想中的美麗。以全體講來，那末瑪玲台德麗，琪恩哈羅，安秀麗丹等都可稱是具有最近理想中的美麗體態，但尙不能合於理想的標準。所以現在各影片公司正在搜羅一位合於理想的女明星，她的體態須具有桃樂賽拉摩的腰，狄安娜寳萍的四肢，陶樂絲德里奧的眸子，洛麗泰楊的嘴，安娜倍拉的鼻，愛妮泰羅薏絲的眉毛，然而竟一時未能發現。至於要到何年何月，那只好到那時候再來奉吿諸位讀者了！了潘麗茜拉蘭，羅斯瑪麗蘭，洛拉蘭三人早在電影界服務外，現在他們的大姊麗泰蘭（Leota　Lane）也由舞台轉人銀幕，那麼現在已由一門三傑而再加一傑了。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Britain's Attitude Becomes Increasingly Firm: Continues to Arrest Japanese Residents in the Far East; Five People Detained in Singapore, Burma, and Hong Kong; Shigemitus Visited the British Foreign Minister to Formally Demand Release <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>London, Last night, a number of Japanese residents were arrested in various British Straits Settlements and parts of Burma for violating various national defense laws. Currently, the number of British residents arrested in Japan has decreased to seven or five. The Japanese Embassy announced last night that four more Japanese residents were arrested by the British authorities late last week, along with one Japanese person in Singapore and three others detained in Rangoon. The Japanese Embassy further stated that three weeks before Japan began arresting British residents, three Japanese residents had already been detained by the British authorities. Japanese sources reported last night that the Japanese Ambassador to London, Mamoru Shigemitsu, may visit British Foreign Minister Halifax again today to inquire about the details of the Japanese residents' arrests. It is said that Shigemitsu will formally demand their release "unless the British side can provide sufficient proof." Japanese sources stated that the Japanese Ambassador was not entirely satisfied with the British argument that the arrest of Japanese residents was unrelated to the arrest of British residents in Japan on suspicion of espionage. It is reported that Shigemitsu has sent a detailed report of his conversations with the British Foreign Minister to Tokyo and is awaiting instructions. When Shigemitsu spoke with Halifax last Saturday, he did not demand the release of the arrested Japanese residents; he only questioned the reasons for the arrests. The Japanese Embassy announced that the three Japanese residents detained in Rangoon were detained by the British authorities on Friday evening. The Japanese Embassy stated that the Japanese residents detained in Rangoon were all "businessmen." (United Press dispatch of the 5th)</p>
<p>Singapore, The British arrest of foreigners suspected of espionage has now extended to the Far East. Kobayashi Sekiro, the manager of the "Oriental News Agency" run by the Japanese, was arrested at his residence yesterday. At the same time, although Singapore was declared by Japan last week to be within the scope of the new "Greater East Asia" doctrine, it remains very calm. The Singapore "Street Times" commented yesterday, "The Japanese are currently in a dream of ruling Asia. They may be complacent now, but the dream will eventually be shattered, and they will eventually have a headache." Commenting on Japan's statement last week, the newspaper said, "The statement is based on Japan's mistaken belief that Japan can resolve the Sino-Japanese War at any time it wishes and act as the arbitrator of the Far East." A reporter inspected various locations yesterday and saw anti-aircraft artillery positions densely set up. Indian, Malay, and British troops were also crowded on the roads. Europeans drafted into the army continue to train here, even on weekends. At the same time, the volunteer army has also been undergoing rigorous training since July 8th. The people's self-defense organization has also achieved good results in controlling food. Air raid prevention training is also continuing. There will be three nights of complete blackout in early September for practice. (United Press dispatch of the 5th)</p>
<p>Hong Kong, According to a telegram from Rangoon, three Japanese residents in Burma were detained by the authorities at 7:00 PM on Friday. One was a Japanese businessman named Okaku, one was the manager of a private company named Furuta, and the other was named Kokubo. Kobayashi, the branch director of the Japan Alliance News Agency in Singapore (also the president of the Oriental News Agency and a businessman in Burma), was arrested by three detectives at 6:30 AM on Sunday. His residence was also searched. According to news from Singapore, the detectives have not yet explained the reasons for Kobayashi's arrest. It is expected that Kobayashi may be deported. Since the beginning of this month, the number of Japanese residents arrested in British territory on suspicion of espionage has reached six, and this is the first time that Japanese residents have been arrested outside the British Isles. (Dispatch of the 5th)</p>
<p>Hong Kong, The police authorities here arrested three Japanese people who had just arrived in Hong Kong yesterday under the Emergency Defense Regulations. (United Press dispatch of the 5th)</p>
<p>Hong Kong, It is reported that the special branch of the Hong Kong police arrested a Japanese person named Yamaguchi on Saturday and Sunday under the Defense Regulations. He is the owner of the Yamaguchi Company, which was formerly located in Fuzhou and recently moved to Hong Kong. (Reuters dispatch of the 5th)</p>
<p>London, It is learned that the British authorities have issued deportation orders for Eguchi, a Japanese resident who is an employee of the Bank of Taiwan, and the German wife of the Japanese painter Yoshii. According to news from Singapore, Kobayashi, the current manager of the Oriental News Agency and former reporter for the Allied News Agency, has been detained by the police. (Reuters dispatch of the 5th)</p>
<p>Japan's Official Stance Remains Silent: Awaiting Reports from Various Embassies and Consulates</p>
<p>Hong Kong, Tokyo dispatch, Although the comments in various newspapers here are extremely agitated regarding the British arrest of Japanese residents in London, Singapore, and Hong Kong, the spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs remained silent. When answering inquiries at a press conference today, he only said that the matter is not being discussed at this time, but is awaiting the official reports from Shigemitsu Kui's negotiations with Foreign Minister Halifax, as well as the negotiations between the Japanese Embassy and consulates in various locations with the British side. The specific charges against the Japanese residents arrested in London, Singapore, Hong Kong, and other places, especially the charges against the Japanese residents arrested in Hong Kong, are completely unknown. When reporters asked whether the government would adopt a policy to prevent the further deterioration of British-Japanese relations, the spokesman replied that he could not say for sure. When reporters asked whether Britain was cooperating with Japan regarding the closure of the Burma Road, the spokesman pointed out that Britain's permission to close the Burma Road for the transportation of military supplies began on July 18th, and it has only been two weeks.

<p>Konoe Visited the Emperor Yesterday Morning; People in Tokyo, Osaka, and Other Places Held Anti-British Meetings</p>
<p>Tokyo, Representatives from various groups in Osaka City held a special meeting today and passed a resolution stating, "We demand the elimination of the forces of violent Britain." After the resolution was delivered to the British Consul General, it was telegraphed to the British Ambassador Craigie. The meeting also decided to urge the government to adopt a tough stance against Britain regarding the arrest of Japanese residents and decided to hold anti-British mass rallies in major cities such as Tokyo. At the same time, the directors of the Kobe Chamber of Commerce also passed a resolution requesting Britain to reconsider its attitude and requesting the ministers of the Navy, Army, and Commerce to advance Japan's position on the matter. Prime Minister Konoe had an audience with the Emperor this morning. (Reuters dispatch of the 5th)</p>
<p>Japanese Navy, Army, and Foreign Ministers Hold Meeting to Review Arrest of Residents Incident</p>
<p>Tokyo According to semi-official Japanese sources, observers close to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs claim that if the situation of the British arrest of Japanese residents deteriorates, the Japanese government has fully decided to take severe measures. The Asahi Shimbun reported that Foreign Minister Matsuoka has decided to lodge a strong protest with Britain, demanding the immediate release of all arrested Japanese residents and guaranteeing that there will be no more illegal arrests. The newspaper also stated that the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs believes that if Britain does not show sincerity in this matter, Japan will abandon continued diplomatic negotiations and take a "serious political action." The meeting of the Navy, Army, and Foreign Ministers this afternoon has been confirmed, but it is said that no decision was reached. According to a spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the meeting was routine in nature and reviewed all aspects of the incident and agreed to defer a decision pending more detailed information. According to official Japanese telegrams received here, a total of nine Japanese residents living in the British Empire have been arrested to date, including three in Rangoon and one each in Singapore and Hong Kong. It is reported that the Japanese residents arrested in Rangoon were all businessmen, while the one detained in Hong Kong was a cotton cloth merchant named Yamaguchi. The Japanese Consul in Hong Kong is said to have protested to the Hong Kong authorities. (Reuters dispatch of the 5th)</p>
<p>Tokyo, According to the Yomiuri Shimbun, the Army, Navy, and Foreign Ministries held a special meeting today to consider the British and British Empire's arrest of Japanese residents. It is expected that the meeting will have "important" results. While officials have not yet provided clear guidance, the comments made by Japanese newspapers when publishing the arrest news remain relatively cautious. Although various parties are clamoring for "action," there is currently no indication of what kind of action is desired or what kind of action will be implemented. However, the atmosphere remains tense. (Reuters dispatch of the 5th)</p>
<p>Rome Attaches Importance to the British-Japanese Incident: Japan Will Move Closer to Germany and Italy</p>
<p>London, The release of British people arrested in Japan is continuing. According to telegrams received by the Japanese Embassy last night, James Sandford Leach and Ali, four people, have been released. James is the manager of Molon Trading Company in Kobe, and Sandford is a merchant in a certain place in Korea who also serves as the chairman of the Kobe and Osaka Chambers of Commerce and the honorary consul of Sweden. As for Ellis, the general manager of Asahi Oil Company in Yokohama, there was news last week that he had been released at the same time as five other British people. Japanese newspapers believe that the detention of two famous Japanese businessmen in Britain was an act of retaliation by Britain for Japan's detention of British people. However, people here declare that the two events are completely unrelated. Britain has the desire to maintain friendly relations with Japan, so there has been no action. At the same time, it also agreed to temporarily close the Burma Road to show its willingness to improve the atmosphere between the two countries. However, the true value of this gesture does not seem to be understood by Japan, and thus rhetoric hostile to Britain as an enemy country suddenly arose. (Reuters dispatch of the 5th)</p>
<p>Rome Attaches Importance to the British-Japanese Incident: Japan Will Move Closer to Germany and Italy</p>
<p>Rome, Political figures here last night viewed the recent British-Japanese incident as likely to have a serious impact on the future relations between Britain and Japan, which may bring Japan closer to the Rome-Berlin Axis. Well-informed Italian sources said last night that Japan could also use the British-Japanese incident to sever diplomatic relations with Britain. The Italian side also felt that any hope of the London authorities repairing Britain's relations with Japan in the Far East had been dashed. Britain has major interests in Singapore and Hong Kong. Most Italian observers here predict that Japan's attitude towards Britain will inevitably become stronger, and Japan's attitude towards the Rome-Berlin Axis will become more friendly. Observers here recalled the news that the all-powerful nations such as Germany, the Soviet Union, Italy, and Japan agreed to economic cooperation in the hope of crushing the British economy. The recent British-Japanese incident will enable Japan to join the four-nation economic cooperation plan, so that the Soviet Union can replace Britain as the main customer of Japanese goods. Observers also suggested that the Japanese can find ways to improve Soviet-Japanese relations in the Far East, based on mutual anti-British sentiments, to suit the position of the Rome-Berlin Axis. Roman newspapers, including the Italian People's Daily, published telegrams from Tokyo yesterday, implying that Japan will take definite retaliation against the British authorities' arrest of nine Japanese residents, including a naval and land blockade of Hong Kong to completely isolate Hong Kong. It is widely rumored here that the British-Japanese incident will give Japan an excuse to take tough action against British commercial interests in China. Some people feel that the British-Japanese incident may be a prelude to Japan's severing diplomatic relations with Britain, so that Tokyo will have greater freedom in dealing with British-Japanese issues in the Far East by "direct methods." Italian observers, including Geda, the mouthpiece of Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, all view the British-Japanese incident as further isolating Britain in other parts of the world. Italian newspapers unanimously ridiculed Britain's "great isolationism" yesterday. The Rome People's Daily stated, "The British government's order to arrest famous Japanese residents is undoubtedly a retaliation against Japan. The British government has only one goal, which is to make all countries in the world oppose Britain. Has Intelligence Minister Cooper said that Britain's best bet is to fight alone? We can be sure that the British can achieve that enjoyable isolation, but we cannot be sure that the British are extremely fond of isolation." (United Press dispatch of the 5th)</p>
<p>The Chinese Side Welcomes the British Attitude: Pays Attention to Japan's Future Actions</p>
<p>Chongqing, People on the Chinese side here have expressed welcome for the stronger attitude taken by Britain in dealing with Japan, as shown by the British and other parts of the Empire's arrest of Japanese residents. They are now watching closely to see what means Tokyo will take to deal with Britain's recent actions. According to the opinion of people on the Chinese side, Britain's actions may only be a test of the new diplomatic policy of the Konoe Cabinet to see whether Japan is truly joining the Axis countries to deal with Britain or is simply pressing Britain to make greater concessions in the Far East. It is generally believed that the arrest of Japanese residents in London may accelerate Japan's actions in the Far East and may take immediate action to deal with British interests in the Far East, such as seizing the British Concession in Tianjin or attacking Hong Kong and the Shanghai Public Concession, which may result in a rapid international development in the Far East. Recalling the reasons why London expressed concessions to Japanese pressure, it was said that because Britain had not yet obtained a guarantee of active assistance from the United States, it could not call Japan's bluff. Therefore, Britain's recent actions have given rise to speculation as to whether the United States has given such a guarantee, especially given the recent US embargo on oil, scrap iron, and aircraft oil.

<h3 id="e2">Prospects for British-Japanese Tension <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Relations between Britain and Japan have suddenly become strained recently: and the repercussions have not yet subsided, and there is a view that they will become more acute. This is another very important link in the overall international situation, and it is something that deserves attention. Because last week, the Japanese authorities, under the pretext of investigating foreign espionage, arrested a large number of British residents, resulting in one person falling to his death; British public opinion was agitated, and some advocated retaliation. In the past three days, the British authorities in London, as well as various territories such as Singapore, the Straits Settlements, Burma, and Hong Kong, have arrested Japanese residents on the grounds of violating various regulations related to national defense. As of yesterday, ten people have been arrested. The British authorities claim that the matter is a routine affair and not retaliation. How strongly this stimulates the Japanese government and the public is naturally within the expectations of the British side, but the British side did it resolutely. The United States views this as a strengthening of the British attitude, an unexpected expression. Is this also unexpected for the Japanese?</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the European War, Britain has been seeking peace and compromise with Japan; whatever Japan has asked for, it has disregarded domestic and foreign criticism and condemnation, and even discarded international morality, treaty obligations, in order to accommodate Japan; such as the concession of the Chinese silver deposit issue in the British Concession in Tianjin, and the agreement to temporarily suspend transportation to China through Burma, which are the most prominent examples. Japan then regarded Britain as despicable, and anti-British movements were often high. After Konoe formed his cabinet, he became even more contemptuous of Britain; when talking about national policy, he hinted at excluding it from East Asia; when talking about diplomacy, he listed his wishes for Germany, Italy, the United States, and the Soviet Union, but did not mention Britain; and the government-controlled media openly criticized it and compared it to an enemy country; Konoe took office for only two weeks and did nothing else, but first arrested British residents. This newspaper has previously argued that Japan is also in a state of hesitation regarding international relations, and that arresting British residents is to test the reactions of both Britain and Germany; it also stated that how Britain responds depends on how Britain assesses its own national strength and honor; and now, regardless of whether Britain does not regard the arrest of Japanese residents as a retaliatory action,</p>
<p>Given the impermanence of international changes and the dangerous and treacherous situation in recent years, no one can say for sure how the deterioration of British-Japanese relations will end. As for the various statements sung by the Japanese side yesterday and today; recalling the ambassador to Britain, severing diplomatic relations with Britain; taking effective means and taking swift action; dealing with violence with violence; and as the Italian newspapers reported from Tokyo, saying that Hong Kong would be blockaded simultaneously from the sea and land. All of these are extremely common; even if the Japanese reaction is even stronger than this, it should not be regarded as unexpected. However, observing the overall situation, British-Japanese relations have probably not yet reached a critical moment of determination. From the British side's point of view: during the negotiations on the Burma transportation suspension issue, and after the agreement was signed, it continued to withdraw women and children from Hong Kong, which shows that it has long been wary of Japan and shows its determination not to make any more concessions; this time, knowing that the Japanese side would definitely have a strong reaction, it still arrested Japanese residents, which is definitely not because the defense regulations were suddenly strictly implemented, nor is it because Japanese residents in various places suddenly violated the regulations at the same time, and it can also be seen that Britain has reached a point where it can no longer make concessions and can no longer tolerate what the Konoe Cabinet has expressed. No more concessions, no more tolerance, but how can there be any active action? On the eve of Germany and Italy's all-out preparations to attack Britain, Britain is eager to do so; therefore, Britain will regard the dispute over the arrest of residents as an independent issue that can be ended at any time, and although it has a strong suspicion of being a major retaliation in terms of meaning and action, it will definitely stop at just this retaliation. In other words, unless Britain encounters some new pressure, new insults, or new provocations from the Japanese side again, it will definitely remain in a state of observation and at the same time be on guard.</p>
<p>From the Japanese side's point of view; the significance of arresting British residents lies in the dual test of pro-German and contempt for Britain, but outsiders have no way of knowing which of the two is more important subjectively. If we analyze them separately, the focus is on the test of contempt for Britain, then Japan is currently suffering from the inability to end its aggression against China and has no energy to challenge Britain. Therefore, today, when Britain has shown that it has indeed reached the point of being unable to tolerate it, Japan is also afraid of making any more factual insults against Britain, and only engages in empty talk and diplomatic offensives, which it cannot help but do. If the focus is on the test of pro-German sentiment, then just this issue of arresting residents is probably not enough to be a pledge to gain Germany's trust, let alone that Britain's reaction is stronger than ever, which makes the Japanese even more discolored. Then, within the limits of not challenging Britain, Japan must take further steps in order to be happily nodded at by Germany? Is Japan prepared? Will it act decisively? It is not to say that there will definitely be no such day, but it is not something to talk about now; why is that? Because Japan today still cannot challenge Britain. Japan will fight Britain either after the end of the Sino-Japanese War or after Britain's great defeat against Germany.</p>
<p>The situation of the British and Japanese sides, unless there are any new actions by the United States and the Soviet Union, or if they have some new impact, is roughly like this, so it is said that the relationship between the two countries has not yet reached an important moment of determination. The length of the period from today until the conditions for determination are fully prepared is unknown. During this period, if Britain can grasp this last juncture where no more concessions can be made and no more tolerance is possible, then although the dispute over the arrest of residents is like this, the wind of threats and intimidation may be slightly reduced!</p>

<h3 id="e4">The Passing of Commander Zhong Yi <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>Chongqing, During the previous battle in southern Henan and northern Hubei, which resulted in a great victory, the Chinese army's General Zhang Zizhong and Commander Zhong Yi heroically defended the country and died heroically. Their great integrity and heroic spirit are admired and mourned by the world. In addition to the story of General Zhang, which has been previously recorded, the following is a brief account of Commander Zhong's passing. Commander Zhong's name is Yi, his style name is Tianren, and he is from Funan County, Guangxi. He was born in the late Qing Dynasty and, feeling the chaotic state of the country, abandoned his pen to join the army. In the ninth year of the Republic of China, he graduated from the Shaoguan Military Academy and then served as a commander and battalion commander. In the thirteenth year of the Republic of China, he assisted Li Bai in establishing Guangxi. During the Northern Expedition, he served as the commander of the Third Regiment of the Seventh Army. In the eighteenth year of the Republic of China, he went to study abroad and returned to China to serve as the captain of the military training team at Guangxi University. In the twenty-third year of the Republic of China, he entered the Army University to study. After graduating, he served as the brigade commander of the 414th Brigade of the 31st Army. During the July 7th Incident, the general led his troops and fought between Jiang, Zhe, Wan, and E. He was promoted to the commander of the ××× Division for his meritorious service and was awarded the rank of Lieutenant General of the Army. In this summer's Battle of Henan and Hubei, the line of Suizao was fiercely fought. The general led the brave men of the entire army, braving arrows and stones, and personally went to the front line. Eventually, due to the disparity in numbers, he died heroically at the age of forty-one. His wife, Ms. Li Huilan, is knowledgeable and literary, and they are a very loving couple.

<h3 id="e10">The Burma Road After the Embargo <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>Chongqing According to an official from the Ministry of Transportation, this year's rainy season will have little impact on the use of the Burma Road. After a year of constant improvements, the road is now quite resistant to harsh weather conditions. There are various reasons to believe that in the remaining rainy season, traffic will not be hindered. The Ministry of Transportation allocated 10 million yuan after last year's rainy season to enhance the road's construction. Today, it can be guaranteed to be reasonably safe and usable. It is expected that even if the road is blocked by landslides, it can be repaired and reopened to traffic in at most one day. Although the import of certain goods on the Burma Road has been stopped by the British authorities, traffic is still continuing. The import of other goods, such as chemical and pharmaceutical supplies, continues as usual. The export of Chinese goods, such as tung oil, has not been interfered with. (5th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing This morning, the Ta Kung Pao published a special article by Zhang Zhongxian, a famous Chinese international affairs writer. The article stated that the conclusion of the British-Japanese Burma Road agreement may not necessarily represent any change in British Far East policy, and its impact may not be serious. However, we should pay attention to what the British policy will be like after three months. The British concessions have the following limitations: (1) The validity period of this agreement is limited to three months. (2) This period coincides with the rainy season. The British position in the Far East must be determined by three factors in the international situation: 1. The success or failure of Germany's blitzkrieg strategy against Britain; 2. The results of the US presidential election in November; 3. The results of Britain's attempts to improve Anglo-American relations. The outcome of the Anglo-German war has only the following three possibilities: (1) Britain is defeated by Germany; (2) The war enters a prolonged stalemate; (3) Germany collapses due to the failure of the blitzkrieg strategy and the success of the British blockade. Except for the first of the above possibilities, if any development falls within the scope of the other two possibilities, then the future British Far East policy may not undergo any changes. If the United States, after the presidential election in November (regardless of whether the Democratic or Republican Party wins), will give Britain continued assistance and adopt a more active stance in the Far East, it seems that the United Kingdom and the United States will take close parallel actions in the Far East. At present, the Soviet Union's policy in Europe is not very clear, but it can be determined that it will not join the German side in the war. Therefore, Anglo-Soviet relations are unlikely to worsen further. Moreover, even if Britain is unfortunately defeated, the Far East policies of the United States and the Soviet Union seem likely to continue along their current lines. Germany's position outside the Pacific is unlikely to intervene. Even if Germany joins the Pacific region, it can be asserted that Germany is doing this for its own benefit rather than for Japan. Although we can lament Britain's violation of international law and its solemn promises regarding the Burma Road, we still hope that Britain will find a way to remedy this situation as soon as possible.

<p>Hong Kong The issue of navigation on the Pearl River has not yet been resolved, so the restoration of normal traffic between Hong Kong and Guangdong has been temporarily delayed. The Hong Kong authorities denied knowing the entire event, only saying that negotiations are in progress. The Japanese Consul-General stated that the Pearl River may not be fully opened, which confirms that the negotiations have not been successful or at least have not ended. The Japanese in Guangdong seem to hope to use the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway as a maritime transport line more than they hope for the opening of the Pearl River. It is reported from Shaoguan that the Japanese army is now trying to open the section of the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway from Shenzhen to Shilong on the East River. The Japanese army outside the border of Hong Kong has increased from one thousand to three thousand, stationed near Bao'an. It is said that after further reinforcements, they will attack the Chinese army along the railway to the north. Recently, the Chinese side bombed Shenzhen, and the Japanese army suffered more than 30 casualties, so the Japanese army will also retaliate. However, the Chinese army is unwilling to engage the Japanese army in Shenzhen because it is too close to Hong Kong. If the Japanese army fires artillery from the north, the shells may fall south of the Japanese army's front line (i.e., Hong Kong). According to reliable sources, the Chinese army will not attack until the Japanese army advances north. (5th International News Agency dispatch)</p>

I personally have many feelings about this point. We should serve the party and the country, and we should implement Dr. Sun Yat-sen's intention. Therefore, no matter which comrade is in which position, in which department, or in charge of which organization, we must not work for power or position, but to save the country. However, to do the work of saving the country, we must have a considerable spirit of sacrifice. We know that Dr. Sun Yat-sen had the greatest spirit of sacrifice when he went north. Now, if we can have this spirit to serve the country, I believe that everything can be successful, and we will be able to complete the revolutionary mission of our party. (5th dispatch)</p>

Ta Kung Pao also strongly stated that the expression of friendly relations between Japan and the Soviet Union is not to be trusted, especially since Konoe and his government, the young officers of the Japanese military, and various industrialists are all strong anti-communist elements.

<p>Shaoguan In order to promote production, the Guangdong Provincial Government has not only formulated a plan to promote production and supervise its implementation, but also ordered a method for official common cultivation, stipulating that all members of the provincial government, from the chairman downward, and the provincial party headquarters, from the secretary downward, must participate in reclamation work, cultivating at least six mu per person. Those who are unable to do so due to official duties may hire someone to replace them. However, the first day of each month is a common cultivation day, and all civil servants must participate in person. (5th dispatch)</p>
<p>Shaoguan The Guangdong Provincial Government is now launching a grassroots campaign to cultivate miscellaneous grains and promote common cultivation to create wealth in order to guide the people, stipulating that each Bao and Jia head and their entire family should reclaim one Chinese mu of land; each township government, two Chinese mu of land; and each agency, school, team, and group, one Chinese mu of land per ten people. It also supervises villagers, requiring each household to cultivate at least one Chinese mu of miscellaneous grains. Land reclaimed is exempt from land tax.

<h3 id="e29">First World War Anniversary British Air Force Intensifies Activity German Synthetic Oil Plant Bombed and Catching Fire British West Coast Under Air Raid Threat <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>London Yesterday was the 26th anniversary of Britain's participation in the First World War. The British Air Force intensified its attacks on Germany. Germany's Kiel port tank center, railways, and airfields were all subjected to large-scale and fierce air raids. However, Germany's offensive against Britain has been the most moderate since the continuous bombing that began on June 18. Some quarters here believe that the reduction in German activity is a sign that Hitler is about to launch the long-awaited blitzkrieg. (5th International News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>London The British Air Force flew to Germany, the Netherlands, and France on Saturday and Sunday to launch large-scale attacks on military targets in order to demonstrate its power. According to the Ministry of Aviation, some of Germany's most important sources of synthetic oil were attacked by British bombers on the night of August 3. Part of the oil plant in the Monheim area was bombed and caught fire. The British aircraft that arrived later found the target by following the light of the fire. The Politz oil plant was also hit by bombs. The enemy has strengthened its local defenses since the first attack. Therefore, in addition to firing at British aircraft going to attack Britain, they also fired dense bombardments of flares dropped by British aircraft. The British aircraft were not hit, but some of the flares were shot down. Other British aircraft were not hindered by poor visibility and managed to find the Kiel dockyards, where they immediately dropped bombs. Naval buildings caught fire. Buildings and airfields in the Hesen area, west of Kiel, were also damaged. In addition, a British aircraft flew to the north of Cologne and circled over a large warehouse for about an hour before dropping high-explosive bombs and incendiary bombs. A seaplane base was also bombed by British aircraft. During the day, British aircraft attacked the Hipol and Hanstede airfields in the Netherlands, the oil pools in Rotterdam, and the railway traffic in the Ruhr and Rhineland areas. Another British bomber flew to Abbeville, bombed a storage area, and swooped down to 50 feet to strafe troops and truck convoys. A列裝甲火車 between Gravelines and Dunkirk, and ships in the canal near Gravelines, were all bombed by British aircraft. Three British aircraft did not return. Yesterday, two British fishing boats arrived at a certain port in Britain. According to reports, they shot down a German bomber in the English Channel. A Reuters reporter recently visited a night raid bomber station at a certain location of the North Command. The crew of the team has won the title of "Night Terror of Germany". According to the crew, the large-scale bombing by the British Air Force has forced the German side to concentrate its anti-aircraft gun defenses around the Ruhr and other areas, and distribute them elsewhere. The German anti-aircraft guns are indeed numerous, and there are even more searchlights. However, German fighter jets are still a mystery and are often encountered during night raids. The rumor that the German side has a large number of blocking balloons is actually a fabrication and not a fact. British aircraft have gradually become familiar with the ground defense countermeasures by adopting clever evasive gliding tactics during night raids, so British aircraft losses are very small. Therefore, new British pilots can take over the tasks of the original pilots, while the original pilots take on the task of guiding the newcomers. This development is very valuable. According to the detailed reports and intelligence of British aircraft observers, the German war machine has suffered a terrible blow. If the British side sends more aircraft to night raid Germany when necessary, the effect will be even greater. (5th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Caron According to newspaper reports, the British Air Force bombed the area near the town of Gosenko in the Berghans area on the night of the 3rd. The bombs all fell in the forest and there was no damage. British aircraft also dropped several explosive bombs near Sywenhert, killing one cow. British aircraft dropped several bombs in Kayadenwald, all of which fell in the fields and there was also no damage. (5th Haitong dispatch)</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden Sources reliable to Norwegian people recently said that German officials currently stationed in Norway believe that the German army may start attacking Britain around August 8 and 10, and that Trondheim has stepped up the construction of fortifications and will become a "Northern Singapore." The entire southwest coast is also covered with anti-aircraft guns due to frequent air raids by British aircraft. (5th United Press dispatch)</p>
<p>Copenhagen British aircraft groups again dropped bombs and bombed various parts of Denmark on the night of the 3rd. According to news issued by the Danish official news agency, the damage was still light and there were no casualties. (5th Haitong News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>London The Ministry of Aviation announced that three German fighter jets were shot down near the southeast coast of Britain this morning. One British aircraft is missing. (5th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Berlin The German High Command issued a war report this afternoon stating that our reconnaissance aircraft sank a merchant ship yesterday 100 kilometers southwest of Pembroke in St. George's Channel, and flew reconnaissance missions over England and Scotland. Our aircraft attacked the dockyards in Sheerness, the gas stations and anti-aircraft gun positions near North Killingholme last night, and were extremely successful. Enemy aircraft bombed western Germany, killing one civilian and destroying one farmhouse. (5th Haitong News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>Berlin Yesterday, the German military headquarters issued a war report stating that the German Air Force is focusing on reconnaissance work on the west coast of Britain. This move is noteworthy because the ports on the west coast of England, the Irish Sea, and the north are generally regarded as safer locations. Cities such as Glasgow, Carlisle, and Lancaster were within the range of German aircraft before the Norwegian war. Since then, the ports on the west coast have gradually become accessible. German aircraft can reach Glasgow in two hours, Liverpool in 100 minutes, and Bristol in one hour. German submarines are now active in the Irish Sea, so the danger to the commercial ports on the west coast of Britain is no different from that of the ports on the southeast coast.

<p>Rome A certain Italian newspaper here predicted that the Italian army, navy, and air force in Libya will inflict "the most devastating blow" on Britain in Egypt and the Suez Canal. It is said that the Italian army has completed preparations for the most serious attack to seize the Suez Canal. This move will make all areas in Africa surrender to Britain, because Egypt and the Suez Canal are the center of British resistance. The Fascist rule newspaper predicted that Italy will also quickly capture Palestine, because according to history, the Italian royal family and the Roman Catholic Church should have the right to rule the holy land. (5th International Alliance dispatch)</p>
<p>Rome The Italian military headquarters issued a war report this afternoon stating that enemy aircraft groups attempted to bomb Libyan troops near the Cyrenaica border. Our aircraft immediately engaged them in air combat and shot down ten enemy aircraft. A team of our bombers went to Marsa Matruh to bomb and shot down one enemy destroyer. Our aircraft all flew back to their original defenses safely. In East Africa, the enemy's attack on Lake Rudolf failed. Enemy aircraft bombed Massawa port, causing slight damage, killing four people and injuring thirty people. Two enemy aircraft were shot down by us. (5th Haitong News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>Cairo It was reported today that two of the Italian aircraft that attacked Marsa Matruh in western Egypt today were badly damaged. British fighter jets took off to intercept them, and the Italian aircraft were forced to drop their bombs into the sea and escape. According to a British Air Force bulletin, British aircraft machine-gunned three Italian bombers parked on the ground at an altitude of 150 feet when they attacked the Daghba area. Today, British aircraft also attacked the port of Massawa and dropped bombs on parked submarines. One warship was directly hit. (5th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Rome A military reporter for the Stefani news agency declared today that the increased activity of the Italian Air Force is part of a plan to destroy the entire British base in East Africa. Hayya is an important British air force base and a key point for Port Sudan to reach the hinterland of Anglo-Egyptian Sudan. Therefore, Italian aircraft are constantly bombing it. Although the British side is firing dense anti-aircraft guns, the railway there was still destroyed by our aircraft. Sammit is also an important location. The British airfield has been hurriedly expanded. When the first team of Italian aircraft went to bomb it, they encountered interception by British aircraft, but they were immediately dispersed by our aircraft and rushed into the bombing, and the hangars caught fire and were destroyed on the spot.

<p>Rome Yesterday, the Haitong correspondent in Rome received detailed information on the fighting of the Italian army on the 3,000-kilometer front line on the Egyptian border, stating that although the war in the Nile River basin is restricted by the rainy season, the war in Kenya is proceeding fiercely. After occupying Dula and several important highways, the Italian army concentrated its forces to attack the most important British fortress, Moyale. The fortress was subsequently occupied by the Italian army, and the avenue leading to Nairobi, the capital of Kenya, was opened to the Italian army. The Italian army advanced along the villages on the plain, which are irrigation stations on the arid plains, with only a few families living there. The British army built fortresses in important villages. The headquarters of the British army is located in Wena, and the Italian army has arrived outside the village and sent aircraft to bomb it. Wajir in northeastern Kenya, where the British army has aircraft hangars and fortresses, has been heavily bombed. Soon, the German army's attack on Britain from the Arctic Circle will echo the Italian army's operations in the equator. (5th Haitong dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e32">Japan's Demands on Vietnam: US Deeply Concerned, Will Strive to Prevent Japan from Obtaining Bases; Pétain Government Negotiating with Japan <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>Washington: Regarding the news that Japan is demanding naval bases in Vietnam, neither the State Department here nor other government officials have heard of it. However, this news has made US officials eager to find out the truth. Government officials did not predict what the US reaction would be if France were to grant Japan's demands. However, well-informed private sources said that based on the US's past attitude, the US would definitely oppose this action, as this action would fundamentally change the entire Southeast Asia, both militarily and politically. They also said that the US's opposition to any changes in the general status quo of the Dutch East Indies and the Far East is already on file in official archives. Although the US has no treaty basis for its concern for the territorial integrity of Vietnam, other due obligations will compel the US to use its power to prevent Japan from obtaining bases in Vietnam. Although Japan's direct purpose in demanding these bases is to defeat the forces of General Chiang Kai-shek, Japan can also use these bases to attack the Dutch East Indies and the Philippines. Military experts say that Japan's occupation of bases in Vietnam will make the Philippines, an important military base for the US to confront this aggressive Far Eastern enemy, lose its importance, and will also make the military fortress of Singapore lose its importance, and will threaten the waterway between British-controlled Hong Kong and Calcutta. The Dutch East Indies will face direct danger. Diplomatic observers say that if France grants Japan's demands, the US attitude towards France will definitely deteriorate, and relations with Japan will become even more strained. (5th United Press)</p>
<p>Vichy: Diplomatic circles claimed last night that the French Pétain government is conducting negotiations with the Japanese government regarding Japan's demand to establish naval and army bases in French Vietnam. The negotiations are currently underway simultaneously in Tokyo and Vichy. The two sides are also negotiating Japan's request to greatly increase trade between Japan and French Vietnam. Japan's demand to establish naval bases in Vietnam is based on the urgent need to end the Sino-Japanese war in southern China. Well-informed sources claim that Japan also wants to dump large quantities of Japanese goods in French Vietnam, while at the same time buying iron, coal, tin, and other raw materials from Vietnam. Detailed contents of the Franco-Japanese negotiations were impossible to ascertain last night. (5th United Press)</p>
<p>Tokyo: The Japanese Foreign Ministry has formally denied negotiating with French Ambassador to Japan, Henri, regarding the demand for Vietnam as a base.

<p>Washington: The United States has recently paid increasing attention to Far Eastern issues, but opinions are very complex on the point of whether to worsen relations with Japan. Utah Democratic Senator William King advocated breaking off relations with Japan and preparing for any changes. Kansas Republican Senator Capper advocated that the United States adopt a "gradual and cautious" policy to avoid being drawn into the Far Eastern war. Although most members of Congress held different views on President Roosevelt's foreign policy, they all unanimously advocated an embargo on aviation gasoline. New York Republican Congressman Fish said that the United States clearly has the right to refuse to sell military supplies to Japan. He said that he strongly supports the embargo on military supplies to Japan, but the most important thing at present is to avoid interfering in Far Eastern events. Florida Democratic Senator Pepper declared that the United States should continue to tighten its blockade against Japan and warned the United States not to adopt a policy of appeasement towards Japan. Indiana Democratic Senator Van Nuys said that the United States should be willing to abandon its interests in the Far East when necessary on the issue of Japan. Japan's policy is an aggressive policy with elements of cooperation with the German-Italian axis. The United States can very well worsen relations with Japan and must implement an absolute blockade against Japan. (5th United Press)</p>

The reason for the reduction is that Greek ships are mostly used for domestic shipping and not for trade with Britain. Since the outbreak of the war, Greek ships have lost a total of forty vessels, totaling 200,346 tons. (5th Huitong Electric)</p>

<p>London: British Military Training Director General Gort spoke on the British Broadcasting Corporation yesterday on the anniversary of the outbreak of the last war, saying that British strength has always been built on service to God, the nation, and humanity. Any great power that does not have this concept of service will not be able to last long. No country can survive for long without religious belief as the basis of its life. What we are engaged in today is not only a struggle to protect democracy, but also a sacred war to defend the religious principles that we have heard from our mothers since childhood. The Nazis also have their religion, which is a religion without God, which is based on material power rather than morality, and its concept is to disregard everything and regard human life as nothing. Although it achieves temporary advantages, the souls of the military and civilians on which the final victory depends have been killed. If the Nazis in Germany and Italy were to win, then the four major characteristics of the British soul, namely religious belief, love of freedom, patience, and respect for individual rights, would be completely wiped out. The goal of our war is to maintain these characteristics. As far as I have seen in the past few months, British youth are full of courage and ready to sacrifice everything for the sake of justice. With firm belief and divine assistance, we must remove this demon from the world. We will move forward with this spirit. (5th Reuters)</p>

<p>The author of this article, John Fisher, is a Berlin-based correspondent for the American Life magazine. During the German offensive in Flanders, he accompanied the first group of correspondents with the army. He traveled through the Netherlands and Belgium to northern France, then along the English Channel to near Dunkirk. At that time, the Germans were bombarding the area, so he turned back into northern Belgium and arrived in Brussels. He reached Dunkirk a few hours after its fall. The original text is translated below:</p>
<p>The military correspondents from various newspapers traveled in seven high-speed military vehicles, departing from Cologne. The group crossed the Meuse River at Maastricht, a key town on the Belgian border. The bridges had been destroyed by the Belgian army, but German engineers had built two iron bridges within twenty-four hours. The German army had also posted notices in the city, warning residents not to leave their homes after 10 PM, to avoid being shot by patrols.</p>
<p>Along the Meuse River, refugees, young and old, were returning to their hometowns, while numerous German military vehicles sped forward at full speed. Food rations were already limited for the residents of Liège. As they approached Namur, the fighting became more intense. Landmines were frequently triggered along the way, so they avoided the main roads. Most of the houses north of Namur were completely destroyed.</p>
<p>Judging from the situation along the way, this war was being fought on the roads. German Messerschmitt bombers flew low along the roads, strafing Allied troops with machine guns, but most of the bombs did not hit the roads. South of Namur, I saw bomb craters stretching for miles on both sides of the road, 150 feet away. Although there were many shrapnel fragments on the road surface, there was no damage. A German officer told me, "Bombing the sides of the road is just as effective. Destroying the road would hinder our advance." The roads built by Belgium were exceptionally sturdy, allowing German mechanized units to speed along at 30 to 40 miles per hour without obstruction.</p>
<p>There were very few soldiers' graves along the road. The German army always buried its fallen soldiers within a few hours to prevent epidemics and avoid the surviving soldiers witnessing the tragic deaths of their comrades.</p>
<p>That evening, they drove through the Maginot Line. The defensive works there were centered on the town of Maubeuge, with strong trenches dug in front, and barbed wire and other obstacles placed in the streets. The Germans concentrated bombardment on it with a large number of tanks, aircraft, and mechanized infantry for three days. Finally, it was broken through by fifteen Stuka bombers within fifteen minutes. The town had 25,000 residents, and all the houses were reduced to rubble, but no street was bombed, showing the intensity and accuracy of the German bombardment.</p>
<p>Two elderly women were searching for furniture in the rubble. They told me that a bomb hit a church, killing fifty refugees. The two women were dazed and acting abnormally, showing the great terror and power of the German Stuka bombers. The bombs dropped by these bombers made a sharp, loud, ear-splitting noise. The stench and blood of the corpses filled the town, which a German officer called "the fragrance of battle."</p>
<p>Arriving in Châlons, they encountered 15,000 British and French prisoners, including a company of British Lancashire infantry. According to the company commander, the Germans attacked fiercely with 300 tanks and many heavy mortars, resulting in 25% casualties for the company. "This loss was due to poor command from headquarters. Otherwise, my brothers could have been moved in time." The army was suddenly put into battle and was not well-equipped, resulting in three days of marching under the scorching sun with a lack of food and water. However, the French army was very well-equipped and had tents.</p>
<p>The officer finally said, "In three days, we didn't see our air force once, and we didn't get a chance to fire a shot. When the German tanks approached, there was a chance to shoot, but the French officer was afraid that the British artillery fire would be inaccurate and mistakenly injure French infantry, so he forbade the bombardment." I asked what he thought of the German army. He replied, "The Germans fight well. My brothers didn't know how to deal with them. I will report to certain officials after I return home." The officer gripped his axe handle tightly, waving it as he spoke, "Everything is a mistake of the politicians!"</p>
<p>From my observation, the morale of the soldiers was still high, and their combat effectiveness was not bad, but the conditions of detention were discouraging. Four people shared only one loaf of bread. No wonder they scrambled for cigarettes and bread from us. Some of them were washing clothes by the riverbank, while others were making fires with branches to cook the remaining canned food.</p>
<p>The car passed through Arras, where the station and the city center had been destroyed by artillery fire. Continuing towards Boulogne, they saw thousands of Allied six-inch shells piled up along the way. British trucks, repainted, were used by the German army to transport supplies, traveling back and forth. Mixed in were motorcycle units with machine guns, and many trucks filled with infantry, marching forward with high spirits. The victors and the vanquished were truly in different worlds.</p>
<p>These German mechanized units sped at forty miles per hour, and there were no car wrecks along the way. I was very surprised and asked a German officer, "How do you do this?" He was shocked and replied, "Crashing cars is against military orders."</p>
<p>The docks in Boulogne were shattered, and all the warehouses were leveled. Allied supplies were scattered on the ground. There were also hundreds of barrels of wine, showing that the French army could not live without it for a day. They then drove along the coast, passing Calais and Saint-Omer to Cassel, which was located on high ground and had several cannons and anti-aircraft guns. Trucks and armored vehicles were everywhere. Ammunition, wine bottles, and canned food were piled up. There were even soccer shoes, targets, and other recreational toys in the garbage, showing that the British army had everything it needed on the coast, which was very different from the interior.</p>
<p>Bergues was the last defense area of Dunkirk. As we approached the area, we got out of the car and walked forward to scout the way. At that time, groups of German Stuka bombers were trying to break through the French anti-aircraft fire. We stopped to watch and saw shells bursting behind the aircraft, with small clouds of white smoke very close to the tail, but none hit.</p>
<p>Then they proceeded one after another along the railroad tracks. Entering Bergues, they saw trucks, cars, and other vehicles that had been hastily pushed into the road to create obstacles, but it was ineffective. The city gate was blocked by a giant American-made rotary snowplow, behind which was the leftover food left by the French machine gunners, who had retreated before finishing their meal. I squeezed into the city and saw nothing but ruins. German Stuka bombers and artillery had bombarded the city for four days, and none of the houses survived. In the rubble, the embers had not completely extinguished, and the smoke from the burnt wood and fabrics suffocated. Some churches were intact, while others had their spires destroyed. German shells still flew overhead from time to time, and the sound of French and German machine guns echoed on the ground. To the north, Dunkirk was burning, with thick smoke covering the sky.</p>
<p>Walking through the streets of Bergues, they saw residents crawling out of underground cellars everywhere. Two thousand people were trapped in the city during the six-day siege. They then saw a bombed-out French tank, next to which were several warhorses, grazing leisurely. The German army had captured enough cigarettes, chocolate, and other food to last for six months, and millions of rounds of ammunition.</p>
<p>The Germans were still fiercely bombarding Dunkirk, so they headed south from Bergues to Lille. The suburbs of the city were completely destroyed, but the city center was still intact. Near Arras, they saw thousands of French prisoners, surrounded by barbed wire and guarded by only one German soldier.</p>
<p>Late at night, they entered Brussels. Except for the bridges and radio station being destroyed, there was no other damage. The cafes along the road were thriving, with many German soldiers as customers. Trams and buses were running as usual. American-made cigarettes were becoming scarce. Bread purchases were restricted. The streets were all under German control. Although the residents were unhappy, the German soldiers behaved well, and there was peace between the victors and the conquered. As for the Belgian king's order to cease fire, Belgian public opinion could be summarized in one sentence: "Emotionally, it is inappropriate, but intellectually, it is approved."</p>
<p>The next morning, they headed north and spent the night in Ostend. At dawn, they proceeded towards Dunkirk along the coast. They saw German supply trains heading back to the rear, like long snakes. According to military sources, the battle of Dunkirk was almost over. Driving along the Moers Canal, they saw several barges burning in the canal, and Allied trucks lined up in the fields, stretching as far as the eye could see. Abandoned equipment and supplies filled the ditches. The French army had flooded the Moers Canal when retreating, and the area near Dunkirk was flooded, so German tanks could not be used and the attack had to be mainly carried out by infantry and artillery. German soldiers waded through the water, which was chest-deep.</p>
<p>Dunkirk had been fiercely bombed by German aircraft and artillery for seven days and nights. We arrived there a few hours after the surrender of the 40,000 French rearguard troops. I witnessed the most brutal destruction. No house was intact. The streets were piled with rubble several feet high. Refugees who had fled to the countryside soon returned. Large groups of German troops were heading south. An officer told me, "The battle here is over, and we are looking for new battlefields." I felt that the extreme destruction of the war was everywhere and there was nothing to stay for, so I drove back to Berlin with my travel companions.</p>

<h3 id="e55">China Possesses Excellent Conditions, Victory Is Only a Matter of Time, The Mainland Is Full of Vigor and Belief Is Firm, Japanese Aircraft's Expensive Bombs Are Counterproductive, Comments from a French Diplomat after Traveling in the Mainland and Returning to Shanghai <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>According to a certain French ex-diplomat, who recently arrived in Shanghai from Free China, who told the Da Zhong News Agency yesterday, although the lives of the Chinese people on the mainland are quite difficult, their expectations and contributions to their motherland are increasing day by day. The person most admired the spirit of the Chinese people in sacrificing everything for the independence and freedom of their motherland. The following is an excerpt from their conversation:</p>
<p>Deep Impressions That Will Never Be Forgotten</p>
<p>Although I only traveled to Chongqing, Kunming, and other places away from Shanghai for a month or two, the impressions I gained will never be forgotten. When I arrived in Free China, it was during the time when Japanese aircraft were indiscriminately bombing all day long, intending to break the Chinese people's determination to resist. Therefore, every morning at nine o'clock and every afternoon at six o'clock, the shops in various major towns stopped business and took precautions. However, not long after the air raid alarm was lifted, people returned to their places of work and took their positions to engage in their great reconstruction project. The general Chinese people had quite humorous remarks about the Japanese bombing, saying that the Chinese were just wanting to have these old-fashioned houses destroyed, and the Japanese were actually willing to use tools worth tens of thousands of yuan per bomb to replace the hard work of the workers, which was very grateful.</p>
<p>The Glorious History Is About to Be Completed</p>
<p>The value of foreign goods in the local area is extremely high. For example, I went to a bar to buy a small glass of whiskey, and it cost as much as sixteen yuan. The person is a typical Frenchman, so his conversation was elegant and humorous. When the conversation reached this point, he opened his mouth wide and stared silently for a long time, then excitedly gesticulated and described the infinite hope of Free China, saying that it made people believe that the dawn of China's victory in the war of resistance was not far away. He concluded by saying, "It goes without saying that China will be able to obtain its sovereignty and territorial integrity. The heroic spirit of the Chinese people this time, and the international environment and material conditions of both China and Japan, have long proven who victory belongs to, and the completion of China's glorious history is only a matter of time."</p>

<p>According to the English-language Greater Shanghai Evening Post, at 3:30 PM today (the 5th), a bomb was found in the cement shelter across from the Greater Shanghai Evening Post office. It is reported that since the morning of the 3rd, French Annamese soldiers have been stationed in the shelter, and barbed wire obstacles have been erected to strengthen the protection of the Greater Shanghai Evening Post office. It is reported that a high-explosive bomb was recently discovered in the printing room of the Greater Shanghai Evening Post, and a Russian police officer suddenly disappeared. Now there is another bomb in the cement shelter, which deepens the suspicions. According to the French Concession Police Department's response to reporters, no bomb was found in the shelter, only an electrician was installing a fan in the shelter, causing a disturbance. However, reporters glimpsed the bomb, which was 6 inches long, 4 inches wide, and 2 inches deep.</p>
<p>Two Russian Police Officers Dismissed for Disappearance</p>
<p>According to the English-language Greater Shanghai Evening Post, the Russian police officer Haliabin of the French Concession Police Department, recently disappeared while guarding the Greater Shanghai Evening Post office. According to sources close to the police, Mr. Haliabin was previously involved with a certain White Russian "fascist" group in Harbin. Therefore, the French Police Department has dismissed two other Russian police officers. The French Police Department declined to comment on this statement. It is believed that the two dismissed Russian police officers were close friends of Mr. Haliabin.</p>

<p>The Ningbo Shanghai Association yesterday continued to receive reports on the situation after the recapture of Zhenhai as follows: (1) At 2:15 AM yesterday, four Japanese warships were anchored outside the port of Zhenhai. Two of them sailed away, and one remained, firing two shells towards Jiangnan at around 9:00 AM. Also, at 3:45 AM yesterday, two Japanese warships were discovered on the Hengshan sea, without any changes. (2) At 7:12 AM and 10:50 AM the previous morning, the Japanese warships outside the port of Zhenhai fiercely bombarded battlefields in Jiangnan with heavy artillery, firing more than twenty shells one after another. Intermittent artillery fire could be heard in Ningbo, but the shells all fell in remote suburbs, so there was no loss whatsoever. (3) At 8:30 AM the previous morning, a medium-sized Japanese warship on the Qiancang sea also fired more than ten shells aimlessly towards the Xiangshan port coast, and released speedboats to chase after civilian ships, capturing dozens of them.</p>
<p>Japanese Aircraft Sightings</p>
<p>(4) At 2:35 PM the previous afternoon, Japanese aircraft appeared over Wenling. Ningbo issued an air raid alert. The aircraft crossed Ninghai. Ningbo issued an emergency alert. The aircraft then circled over Songao, Fenghua, and the four suburbs of Ningbo, and then flew out to sea from Longshan. Ningbo only lifted the alert at 3:03 PM. (5) In other news, a large number of Japanese aircraft, totaling 24, passed through the Qianqing town between Xiaoshan and Shaoxing yesterday, flying west in formation. Later, it was heard that Japanese aircraft had also passed through Fengqiao, Yiqiao, and Dongyang. However, their final destination is unknown. Also, in recent days, the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway line has been indiscriminately bombed by Japanese aircraft. It is speculated that these Japanese aircraft will harass the railway line again. (6) At 8:48 AM on the morning, a Japanese aircraft was discovered over Guanhaiwei. Ningbo issued an air raid emergency alert. Afterwards, the whereabouts of the aircraft were unknown. At 9:08 AM, the alert was lifted. At 3:09 PM in the afternoon, the sound of aircraft was heard in Shipu. Ningbo issued an air raid alert again. The alert was lifted at 3:30 PM.</p>
<p>Zhenhai Emergency Relief</p>
<p>Since Zhenhai suffered from the ravages of war, the Ningbo Shanghai Association has received telegrams one after another requesting relief. Out of concern, the executive committee decided at yesterday's standing committee meeting that it was important to provide relief and assistance to the disaster-stricken people of Zhenhai, and decided to allocate 30,000 yuan, which was remitted to Mr. Jiang Zaitian, a respected elder in Zhenhai, to handle the relief matters nearby. The funds were sent by telegraphic transfer and could be received yesterday. He was specifically responsible for handling the relief matters and was instructed to report the progress of the relief efforts at any time to alleviate concerns. The Zhenhai Emergency Relief Association, organized by the Zhenhai Shanghai Association, had already allocated 10,000 yuan in donations from Shanghai at the end of last month. According to the association's message yesterday, it has been remitted to Zhenhai, and Mr. Zhang Baochao, a member of the World Red Swastika Society in Ningbo, has been sent to Zhenhai to join Mr. Jin Guanggan, the person in charge of the Zhenhai Red Swastika Society, to distribute relief to Xiaogang in Jiangnan and the western suburbs of the county seat of Jiangbei.</p>
<h3 id="e58">British Authority Denies Japanese Newspaper's Report of British Spy Network as Absurd, Claims It Is Completely Unfounded, Also States That British-American Discord Is a Fabrication <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>According to authoritative British sources in this port, the recent publication by the Japanese-language Continental News of the so-called exposure of a large British spy network operating in Shanghai is completely fabricated and has no basis. The various inferences in an article published by the newspaper on Saturday are obviously clumsy and not credible. It is claimed that all British-backed cultural organizations and businesses are playing an important role in espionage activities, etc., which is completely absurd and everyone can understand. Regarding the mention of cultural organizations, the newspaper seems to be completely reprinting the opinions expressed by a certain Japanese official in Tokyo. The official recently made similar accusations against Anglo-Japanese cultural contacts in Japan. Therefore, the newspaper's allegations obviously distort the facts and can only be believed by those who are completely unaware of the situation. The news published by the Continental News on Friday (August ) further confirms that the newspaper deliberately creates various reasons to accuse Britain. It is claimed that "British and American expatriates in Shanghai are mutually scolding each other in wireless broadcasts. A statement on the XCDN radio station stated that 'President Roosevelt had previously suggested Anglo-American cooperation, and said that the front line of democratic countries is actually on the banks of the Rhine, and at the same time guaranteed that he would participate in joint cooperation in international affairs. Has this cooperation been implemented? The United States dares not consider the current situation from the British point of view. Britain trusts the United States too much, resulting in Britain making concessions in the Far East, and the date when the United States will be defeated by Japan is not far away.'" The newspaper continued to say that the Americans refuted the British statement, saying, "Although the British have solemnly expressed mutual support to the United States, they are too impatient and act too independently, resulting in today's tragic situation..." The newspaper's editorial also said, "This kind of mutual scolding on wireless broadcasts has become a laughing stock among the Chinese." According to the British authoritative sources, the XCDN station has never made the above-mentioned statement, nor has it broadcast any report that would cause the above misunderstanding. The contents of the Japanese-language newspaper are completely fabricated from beginning to end. Therefore, the news about the British spy network published by the newspaper is also fabricated.</p>
<h3 id="e59">Although Yizhong Tobacco Factory Resumes Work, Disputes Abound: The Factory Deducts Wages, and the Workers Have Not Compromised <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>The Yizhong Tobacco Company's branch factory in the 路 district, after being shut down, has reportedly resumed work on the first of this month. At the beginning of the resumption, the factory sent a large number of detectives. Without stating any reason, they searched the workers. Forced by the need to make a living, the workers had no choice but to swallow their anger and let them do as they pleased. Regarding the nine workers who had been previously announced as dismissed, despite repeated requests from all the workers to retract the decision, the factory has not made a clear statement. Furthermore, the rice subsidy and allowance during the shutdown period were deducted, disregarding the workers' livelihood. The factory's subsidy and rice allowance for the shutdown period were issued starting from the 16th of last month. However, in reality, the factory had closed its doors and sent detectives to prevent workers from going to work since the 11th. Therefore, the shutdown period should fairly start from the 11th. This action by the factory deducts five yuan, seven jiao, and three fen of rice allowance, and two yuan, three jiao, and six fen of allowance from each worker. Considering that there are more than 2,600 workers in total, the amount is quite considerable. However, the losses suffered by the workers are enormous. Therefore, although the factory workers have resumed work, they are still arguing with the factory about the dismissal of the nine coworkers and the deducted allowances and rice subsidies. They also hope for sympathy and assistance from all sectors of society to prevent the situation from worsening.</p>

<p>Plans for ships to dock at Gu'aotou. According to news from the shipping industry yesterday, the Ningbo River Defense Commander has ordered the prohibition of all sailing ships and steamers from entering, in order to strictly prevent illegal elements from infiltrating. Therefore, transportation between Shanghai and Ningbo has been completely cut off. However, it is learned that 利瑪 Wheel, intentionally managed by the Ping'an Shipping Company, will operate between Shanghai and Cengang (unoccupied territory) in Zhoushan. It left Shanghai the day before yesterday to carry passengers and cargo. Cengang is located outside Zhenhai Port, only 80 nautical miles away, and there are civilian ships traveling back and forth.</p>
<p>Test Voyage to Gu'ao</p>
<p>Wenzhou routes have the most foreign ships operating on them. Since the suspension of navigation, all ships have been anchored in the Pei River, resulting in significant losses. To maintain business, shipping merchants now plan to temporarily operate on the Aojiang route, so as to transfer passengers and goods to Wenzhou. Foreign ships heading to that area will dock at Gu'aotou. This matter is currently being submitted to the consulate authorities for approval. The Changde Wheel of the Italian company Rocco Chi &amp; Co. is scheduled to clear customs this morning. To obtain approval from the customs, it will first conduct a test voyage from Shanghai to Gu'aotou tomorrow morning. Special dispatch from Chongming.</p>
<h3 id="e61">Japanese Army Massacre: Chongming Suffers Calamity; Over a Hundred Japanese Soldiers Killed; Thousands of Civilians Perish; Over a Hundred Puppet Soldiers Among the Japanese Army Annihilated <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>After the fall of Chongming, guerrilla organizations were formed, launching attacks from the east and west, achieving remarkable results. Last month, they launched a large-scale attack. Three Japanese army vehicles were ambushed and surrounded by guerrillas. The Japanese army suffered heavy casualties. Out of shame and anger, they requested reinforcements. They went down to the villages and indiscriminately burned and killed, resulting in the tragic death of thousands of innocent civilians. Furthermore, it is learned that villages and towns such as Shuhe, Dachun, Laba, Xiangtong, Maqiao, Xie, and Rixin, as well as thousands of nearby households, were completely reduced to scorched earth. The burning and killing continued in the past few days. The residents of the county were in a state of panic and could not sleep or eat. Refugees were displaced and had nowhere to turn, their situation extremely miserable. The Chongming fellow villagers in this city are planning to organize a relief association to allocate funds for relief and handle the aftermath.</p>
<p>Over a Hundred Japanese Soldiers Ambushed and Killed</p>
<p>Chongming is surrounded by the sea on all sides and fell into the hands of the Japanese army after the war. However, as the Japanese army suffered successive defeats on various battlefields, the garrisoned Japanese army was completely withdrawn. In total, only sixty to seventy soldiers remained on the entire island. The Chinese military guerrilla forces in Beisha, after receiving orders to launch an offensive, immediately ordered more than ten members to cross the river to Rixin Town in Chongming at the end of last month. They worked as temporary laborers in Japanese factories to take the opportunity to launch an uprising from within. On the midnight of the second of this month, the workers, seizing the opportunity when it was late and quiet, killed all three Japanese people in the factory. After the incident, the guerrillas dispersed and ambushed in the countryside. The local Japanese garrison received the report and immediately summoned all the Japanese soldiers to attack the Chinese army. However, at this time, a large force of the Beisha Chinese army had also crossed the river and attacked the Japanese from both sides. After two hours of fierce fighting, the Japanese army suffered more than ten casualties and retreated. The Japanese army then requested assistance from the Japanese garrison in Shanghai. The Chinese army, knowing that the Japanese army would not give up after the defeat, dug many traps in the main roads, covered them with straw to avoid detection by the Japanese army. When more than eighty Japanese reinforcements from Shanghai arrived in Chongming, they changed to three trucks and advanced towards Rixin Town. As a result, they fell into the Chinese army's trap. The soldiers and vehicles all fell into the pits. The Chinese army, ambushing around, swept the area with machine guns. The Japanese were trapped and unable to resist, and all perished in the pits.</p>
<p>Puppet Self-Defense Corps Annihilated by the Japanese</p>
<p>After the Chinese army achieved two major victories, they dispersed to various villages and towns in the three districts and the 叫 district, such as Dachun Town, Qiangming Township, Puzhen Port, and Xinkai River. The Chongming Japanese army, after suffering two defeats, requested assistance from Shanghai. The Japanese authorities in Shanghai immediately dispatched four hundred soldiers from the defeated troops at Zhenhai Port, transported them by motorboats and transport ships. When they arrived at their destination, the Chinese army had already completed its mission and withdrawn. The Japanese army then disarmed the puppet "Self-Defense Corps" in each area under the pretext of inspection, and then said that the weather was hot and they could play other games, so they could take off their uniforms and bullets. The puppet soldiers, unaware of the plot, complied completely. The Japanese army then indiscriminately swept more than one hundred puppet soldiers with machine guns, leaving no survivors.</p>
<p>Massacre and Burning of Houses: Inhuman Tragedy</p>
<p>After the Japanese army annihilated the puppet Self-Defense Corps, they carried out a massacre of strong men and women in Qiangming Township, Rixin Town, Dachun Town, Xinkai River, Puzhen Port, and other places. Except for the elderly and weak aged seventy or eighty and five or six years old, none were spared. In total, more than seven hundred civilians were killed. All streets, villages, and houses were doused with kerosene and set on fire, burning more than a thousand households. The flames soared into the sky, and the sound of crying shook the earth. The tragic situation was unprecedented in recent times, surpassing the massacres and burnings in Wuzhen and Yuanhua in Zhejiang Province. After this massacre in Chongming, the residents who had not suffered any calamity were extremely frightened. For the sake of safety, they left their homes and moved elsewhere. However, the Japanese army remained unwilling to give up and obstructed the residents from leaving, requiring them to find temporary guarantors and stipulating that only young children and the elderly were allowed to leave. Others were killed without question. Although local Japanese merchants requested leniency to maintain their own business, they were rejected. Residents from other districts, upon hearing the news, supported the old and carried the young, and transferred to Shanghai by boat. The number of people arriving at the port every day was over a thousand.

<p>The issue of mail inspection at the Masnan Road Post Office in the French Concession: Because the inspectors did not go to the bureau for work on the 2nd and 3rd, and the 4th was a regular Sunday holiday, the inspection was not fully completed. Rumors spread widely. Yesterday morning, the Japanese inspectors returned to the bureau, and the number of people increased. The inspection and confiscation of mail items also began to take action. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Inspection Room Completed</p>
<p>According to a reporter from Datong News Agency, the temporary inspection room for Japanese inspectors at the Masnan Road Post Office branch was rushed to completion on the 3rd of this month (Saturday). The location is next to the parcel counter of the bureau, covering an area of ​​12 feet long and 10 feet wide. Wooden boards are placed around it, completely isolating it from the area where postal staff handle postal services.</p>
<p>Japanese Inspectors Stationed Yesterday</p>
<p>Japanese inspectors arrived at the bureau again yesterday at 10:00, increasing the number of people from seven to nine. They immediately began to work in the newly built inspection room. However, when the inspectors arrived at the bureau, the first batch of letters at 8:30 in the morning had already been sent out, so they were not inspected. The second batch of mail, before being sent out at 10:30, was inspected when stamped.</p>
<p>Large Numbers of Mail Items Confiscated</p>
<p>The Japanese inspectors then selected more than one hundred letters, printed matter, and temple mail, and handed them over to postal staff to be numbered and registered in the register. They then took all of them into the inspection room for inspection. The inspectors left the bureau at about 12:00 noon. The inspectors then arrived at the bureau again in the afternoon, and the 2:30 and 4:30 afternoon mail were also selected and taken into the room. As of the evening, the mail that was deemed irrelevant after inspection had not been returned. The inspection of mail such as registered mail and express mail also began to be affected in the afternoon. The Japanese inspectors left the bureau and returned at about 5:00.</p>
<p>Different Records</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, a reporter from Datong News Agency visited Wang Weisheng, the director of the postal administration. According to Wang, today was the most concrete beginning of the inspection of mail at the Masnan Road Post Office. On the morning of the 1st of this month, the bureau initially received a report from the patrolmen that the inspection had begun. Therefore, he frankly admitted it to visitors at the time. Later, according to follow-up reports, it had not actually started yet. The actions of the Japanese inspectors were the same as before the 1st. Therefore, the bureau informed visitors at this time that it had not started yet. Due to the difference in time between the concerns and inquiries, there were two different records in the newspaper.</p>

<h3 id="e72">Case of Tram Inspector Killed: Witnesses Testify on the Events; The Murderer Denies Receiving Bribes in Advance; Court Hearing Adjourned Pending Review of the Records <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>Chen Guohua, the No. 5 inspector of the French tram company, was killed by thugs on the No. 849 Gan Yi Road bus at 2:10 PM on the 25th of last month. The patrolman Hua Ebu captured the murderer, Lu Rusheng, who was wounded. Based on Lu's confession, Wu Senxiang, Bian Jintang, Lu Dianchun, and suspects Xu Renchang, Zheng Yuntian, Lu Zhifa, Yuan Jinshan, and others, totaling thirty people, were arrested and sent to the Special No. 2 Court's Criminal Division 1. Except for Xu Renchang, who was found to be unrelated and not prosecuted, all the other defendants were prosecuted for murder under Article 271 of the Criminal Law. After Judge Zhang Minsheng interrogated them once, he ordered a postponement of the hearing. All the details have been reported in previous newspapers. Yesterday morning was the date for the continuation of the hearing. The audience seats were full. The police dispatched twenty detectives and thirty Chinese police officers to the court for protection. First, witness Li Fenglou, the driver of the No. 849 bus, testified that he heard two gunshots that day. When he looked back, the No. 5 inspector had fallen to the ground. At that time, he continued to drive the bus. The murderer also fired a shot at him, but it missed and grazed his back. He then stopped the bus, and the murderer got out of the car and fled. Next, Wu Renfu, the ticket seller on the car with number 216, testified that he was selling tickets to passengers that day, so he did not know the rest of the situation. Then, the Chinese police officer with number 1100 testified that he was directing traffic at the intersection of Route Lafayette and Father King Road and saw someone running towards him. He was about to stop him when the murderer took out a gun and fired at him. He dodged and missed, and the stray bullet killed Ji Jinfu, a two-year-old boy living at No. 98 Father King Road. Finally, Chinese police officers with numbers 730, 739, and 302 testified that they were patrolling on Father King Road that day when they suddenly heard gunshots on the bus and heard passengers on the car shouting that the murderer was escaping. Soon after, they saw the murderer running towards them and joined forces with the Russian police officer with number 155 to shoot the murderer, causing the murderer to be injured and fall next to the No. 55 electric pole on Moli'ai Road. At this point, the police lawyer Yao Zhaodi requested the court to question the murderer Lu Rusheng about whether he had received 250 yuan from the defendants before shooting the deceased. According to Lu, he had not received 250 yuan and had not heard of such money. However, he knew Bian Jintang in the South City. This time, Bian lost his job and asked him for help, so he committed the murder. The court adjourned the hearing and ordered the investigating officer Yan Jinwen to take the defendants back to the police station pending a detailed review of the records.</p>
<h3 id="e73">Confessed to Killing His Wife and Surrendered: Whether It Is True Remains to Be Investigated <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>A man from Changzhou named Ding Xuda (28 years old) suddenly surrendered to the Laoza Gate Police Station on Saturday night, saying that his wife, Gao (24 years old), had been killed by him, so he surrendered. The Chinese investigator Li Pengfei investigated the matter. According to Ding, he had been married to his wife Gao for eight years and had a son (seven years old) and a daughter (three years old). They used to live in their hometown. Recently, due to the unrest in the area, they left the two children with the Qi family and came to Shanghai with his wife. They arrived in Shanghai on the 14th of last month and stayed in a small inn near the Great World. They lived there for four days. Later, because they did not have much money, they were eating their way through it, and the money was running out. They discussed ways to make a living. His wife was willing to go out to work as a helper, and he also planned to pursue his usual tailoring business. They decided to go out to make a living on the 18th. If they were successful, they would meet at the inn at 1:00 PM. He found a tailoring job, so he arrived at the sewing shop at the appointed time. But he waited a long time and did not see his wife arrive. He had no choice but to check out of the inn. He searched for several days but could not find his wife. On the night of the 2nd of the month, he suddenly met his wife at the intersection of Xinzha Road and Changsha Road. According to his wife, she had found a job. He questioned her as to why she did not go to the agreed-upon meeting place, and they started arguing. They walked together to the Suzhou River on Yu Qiaqing Road. In a moment of anger, he beat his wife several times. Unexpectedly, she fell to the ground and died. There was nothing he could do, so he threw the body into the Suzhou River. He asked himself if he had encountered this misfortune, so he surrendered. However, the investigators could not find his wife's body, so they temporarily detained Ding. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Special No. 1 Court's Criminal Division 1. Police lawyer Ru Baoyi said that whether Ding's confession was true still needed to be investigated in detail, so he requested permission to temporarily detain him and re-examine him at a later date. After questioning by Judge Xiao 棻, the court ordered Ding Xuda to be temporarily detained for a week for re-examination.</p>
<h3 id="e74">Coir Mattress Industry Labor Dispute: Argument in Teahouse Turns Violent; Thirteen Workers Fined <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>There are more than 100 businesses that operate coir mattress shops in Shanghai, and there are quite a few workers. After the establishment of the labor union last year, the employers, in view of social trends, established a guild in the early summer of this year. Recently, they held an inaugural meeting and elected Sheng Yongfa as the chairman of the committee and submitted it to the competent authority for filing. The guild stipulated that a fee of one jiao would be charged for each coir mattress sold in the same industry. If it is found that the fees stipulated in the articles of association have been evaded and not paid, a fine of five yuan in national currency will be imposed for each coir mattress to show punishment. This aroused opposition from the labor union, believing that they could not afford to pay this burden during the current high cost of living in Shanghai. Therefore, the labor and management decided to discuss the guild regulations at the Nanyang Teahouse a few days ago. Once they disagreed, the two sides began to quarrel and then turned violent. Teapots and teacups were used as weapons and thrown at each other, flying all over the room. The chairman of the employer's guild, Sheng Yongfa, and others, and the workers of the labor union were all injured, with their heads broken and bleeding. The owner of the teahouse, Wang Bingfu, could not stop them and reported it to the police station in charge, who immediately dispatched a large number of detectives to the scene and detained 23 people from both labor and management. After interrogation, they were sent to the court yesterday. The police lawyer sued them for crimes such as injury and damage. After Judge Zhong's review, he declared the verdict in court. Sheng Yongfa, Xu Rongsheng, and other nine people from the employer's side were found not guilty. Thirteen workers from the labor union were each fined ten yuan as a warning.</p>
<h3 id="e75">Rampant Gambling in the Nanshi Area; Gambling Dens in West Shanghai Merge into One Business <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>Gambling dens in the Nanshi area have become very active recently. Among the larger ones, the most prominent is Li Xiaoshi's Lao Ximen Xiyuan gambling den, which opened on the 31st of this month. It even had so-called male and female celebrities inaugurating it with a ribbon-cutting ceremony. After its opening, there was also a Western music gambling den opposite the Chen Yingshi Pagoda in Lao Ximen, near Jinjia Arch. There was the Yongyuan gambling den on Dajing Road, the Yongli gambling den on Luxiangyuan Road in the Nine Acres area, and the Tongbaotai on Gaodun Road, which specialized in defrauding people of their money.</p>
<p>These gambling dens appeared one after another.</p>
<p>They are all managed by a group of people led by Lu Gensheng and Xiang Changlin. Li Xiaobao's flower lottery has also been greatly expanded. A group of listeners have even installed beautiful counters and neon signs in places like the Nine Acres area, just like lottery ticket shops. In addition, there are opium dens like the Siwu Liu Talking Room, the Gaolu, the Wannianqing, and the Nanyang Bridge Paradise in the Nine Acres area. All of these places have</p>
<p>rosewood opium beds,</p>
<p>often as many as ten or more in each establishment, with colorful electric light signs, exactly the same as the large opium dens on Jing'an Temple Road in West Shanghai. However, the Sanxin gambling den, which cost 170,000 yuan, was uniquely prohibited from opening after a postponement of seven months, causing its manager, Pu Aben, great distress. As for the gambling dens in the badlands of West Shanghai, after being sealed by the Japanese military police, the owners of the various gambling dens worked hard to maneuver and changed their names to dance halls, night gardens, and grand hotels, so that they could be revived and continue to operate in a semi-public manner, purely as a temporary measure. However, six establishments including Hollywood, on the 31st of last month,</p>
<p>merged into one,</p>
<p>moving to a new location to do business, temporarily named "Six Nations Hotel" (or possibly renamed "Hualian"). The new location is at 346 Haig Road, on the border between the Public Concession and the French Concession. Due to the small size of the premises, it is said that the gamblers who went there were initially quite crowded, and the Public Concession police authorities, in order to prevent accidents, dispatched red police vehicles to patrol in front of the gambling den every day, and inspected passers-by, so business has declined greatly recently.</p>

<p>Zhang Jingji, a depositor at Shenxin Textile Factory No. 1 on Bailinan Road, previously entrusted lawyer Cai Liucheng to file a lawsuit with the First Special District Court to recover his deposit. The court ruled that the defendant, Shenxin Textile Company, should pay the plaintiff 57,922 yuan in national currency, plus interest. If the company's assets were insufficient to pay, the defendants, Rong Hongyuan and Rong Hongsan, would be jointly and severally liable. The defendants argued that the company's operations were currently suspended due to the war, the company's foreign debts were unpaid, and Zhang Jingji's deposit was deposited by Zhang Zhizhao, a shareholder of the company. Unless the company continues to operate and repays ordinary debts, the shareholder has no right to claim the deposit. Therefore, they disagreed with the original judgment and entrusted a lawyer to file an appeal. The court opened yesterday morning and ordered both parties to go out for mediation, with the court scheduled to reconvene on August 16.</p>

However, they were also very clear about the difficulties of the labor side, but could not improve the situation for the time being. They would increase the salaries of each person after the business developed in the future. The labor side expressed understanding of the management's reply, and the dispute was resolved.</p>

<h3 id="e83">Fujian Provincial Government Orders All Counties to Increase Salaries for Primary School Teachers by Five Yuan Each, Starting from This Month <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>The Fujian Provincial Government recently issued an order to all county governments, stating that the provincial government had previously stipulated that, due to the difficult living conditions and low salaries of teachers and staff in central schools and national schools, starting from February, the monthly salary of qualified primary school homeroom teachers registered or certified in the province should be at least 24 yuan. The monthly salary of qualified specialist teachers in junior primary schools and kindergartens should be at least 20 yuan. The monthly salary of substitute teachers who have not been registered, certified, or qualified should not be less than 18 yuan. If the counties and districts have exceeded the previous regulations, they should still appropriately increase the salaries. It has been ordered to strictly comply with the regulations. Recently, due to the rising prices of goods, the previously set standards still cannot enable all teachers and staff to serve with peace of mind. Starting from May, all salaries will be increased by another five yuan to show compassion. However, the amount added in March should be deducted (for example, if the original salary was 26 yuan and the salary was increased by 3 yuan in March of this year, then only 2 yuan needs to be added to the salary starting from May). If the amount of the salary increase has already exceeded five yuan, the original amount should be maintained and not increased or decreased.</p>

<h3 id="e89">Fujian Province Will Conduct Registration of Primary School Teachers <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>(Yong'an News) The first Fujian Province Primary School Teacher Certification and Normal School Graduate Registration were held last year. The Department of Education has now received an order from the Ministry of Education to hold a general registration of primary school teachers, including normal school graduates, qualified primary school teachers, and substitute teachers. The Department of Education stated that, regarding "Normal School Graduates" and "Qualified Primary School Teachers," Fujian Province has previously formulated the Fujian Province Normal School Student General Registration Method and the Fujian Province Primary School Teacher Certification Method, which can be used as a basis. However, there are no clear regulations on how to handle the registration of substitute teachers. Therefore, it has formulated a "Fujian Province Primary School Substitute Teacher Registration Method" as a supplement. In order to make the counties understand the procedures for handling the general registration of primary school teachers, it has formulated a "Fujian Province Primary School Teacher General Registration Implementation Rules" in accordance with Article 13 of the Ministry of Education's Outline of General Registration Methods for Primary School Teachers in Various Provinces and Cities. The aforementioned methods and rules have been agreed upon by the Examination and System Office and have been passed by the Provincial Government. They will be announced and implemented by the Provincial Government soon, and the general registration of primary school teachers will be held immediately. Those who qualify for certification will be certified. A portion of the Fujian Province Simplified Normal Schools are former county-run rural teachers and students subsidized from their hometowns. The Department of Education has recently received reports from various schools that county-funded students' subsidies are sometimes not issued or are in arrears by various counties. In view of the fact that schools have difficulties in compensating students' self-raised funds, it is planned to change all students to provincial-funded students starting from the next academic year, in accordance with the Central National Teacher Training Institute's plan. An investigation has already been launched into the number of self-funded and county-funded students in each simplified normal school in order to prepare a budget.</p>

Calculated, the British pound was reduced by 0.115, and the US dollar further tightened by 0.1875. Other rates were consistently tight. As for the domestic market situation, there was a sudden and unusual tightening, and people's hearts were shaken. In the afternoon market, British American Tobacco repeatedly settled large amounts, reportedly reaching 50 yuan per US dollar, and speculators eagerly took them in. Moreover, the Bank of Japan, which had repeatedly sold in recent times, also entered the market.

<p>The rising trend in the rice market: not since the morning opening of the day before yesterday's Sunday holiday, the situation has been tight.

As a result, it rose by a yuan compared to the previous week's closing. No. 1 East-West Saigon was calculated at 59 yuan, and New was 57 yuan. The reason why rice prices were raised was precisely because of the deteriorating relations between Britain and Japan and the issue of Japan's southward advance, which led the goods side to take the opportunity to raise prices. The new floating hoards all took the opportunity to活 跃, and the skin ball trading of抢帽子 gradually began to raise its head on the market again.

<p>Sales Are Not Smooth, Japanese Flour Prices Are Also Slightly Loose</p>
<p>Flour: Yesterday was the beginning of the week, and the flour market transaction was very flat. Check the disk of the No. 2 flour factory is still 15 yuan, and it will not increase or decrease for the time being. The total amount of the two factories sold in the city is about 5,000 bags.

<p>Wheat: Yesterday's wheat market situation is still in the brewing stage. Check the source of Su Xi, because the production price is tight, the arrival is reduced, so the holders all want to sell at a good price. However, because the Japanese factory's inventory is still sufficient, the进 胃 is not strong. Only a few scattered unloading factory goods, and the Chinese factory received more than 2,000 bags, pulling the price at 21 yuan and 45 jiao.</p>

<p>Domestic Debt Rises, Foreign Stocks Are Flat and Tired</p>
<p>Securities dark market: Yesterday's market situation continued to be firm, and people's hearts became more and more prosperous. Because the United States is tough on Japan and the friction between Britain and Japan is getting worse, the market price after deducting interest is already higher than the 除息 time with the interest included. Generally, people believe that it is possible to have the same price as the interest included soon. According to the market popularity and the high barriers of the shorts, it is not impossible. Yesterday, type A had already passed out one yuan, type B had already passed out two yuan, and type E had approached the 50 yuan mark, and the situation was very good. At the same time, although gold is rising, the debt market is not threatened by it, because there are too many shorts. Yesterday, the market price in the morning and afternoon gradually and slowly rose. The attention of buyers and sellers should be paid to No. 38, which specializes in buying type A, because of its close relationship with the lottery. Gong Mao specializes in collecting type B, because it is relatively cheap. Type C is raised by Xie Da, because the market is almost equal to type D. Type D is most favored by No. 16, and the purchase is always unremitting throughout the day. No. 4 collects type E, which is its consistent purpose. The remaining sporadic buyers are not counted. On the selling side, type A is supplied by Yu Xing and Wu Yuan, type B is sold by Hong Kang and sporadic retail investors in many ways, type C is sold by Tong Yu and retail investors, and types D and E are sold by Ji Ji and Da Kangcheng. The daily market price competition is still dominated by many parties. As a result, each bond returned to the upper one or two jiao to five and a half jiao. The total transaction volume was about 1.2 million yuan. A brief table is listed below.</p>

However, in the afternoon, the selling wind suddenly turned strong again, and the market situation fell again. The closing price is the lowest of the day. The instability of the political situation is probably the main reason for the softening of the stock market.

<h3 id="e117">Newspaper Excerpts Sixty-Seven Years Ago (See This Newspaper from the 12th Year of the Tongzhi Reign of the Late Qing Dynasty) (467) The Harm of Lewd Plays <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>The harm of lewd plays is greater than that of lewd books. Lewd books can only be understood by those who are literate, while lewd plays harm both the wise and the foolish. If students, after reciting and chanting in the evening, watch a lewd play, their diligence will be abandoned, and lustful thoughts will arise. If wealthy young men, accustomed to luxury, watch a lewd play, their family fortune will dwindle, and their vital essence will be lost. If farmers, working hard in the fields in all kinds of weather, watch a lewd play, their fields will be neglected, and their energy will be depleted. If merchants, calculating and planning meticulously, watch a lewd play, their money will be squandered, and their business will decline. If virtuous unmarried women, pure as white jade, watch a lewd play, their hearts will be stirred, and they will form illicit relationships like Ying Ge before the boudoir. If widows, guarding their chastity and leaving a fragrant name, watch a lewd play, the allure of springtime will trouble them, and they will grieve for the departing swallows behind the beaded curtains. Even lowly maidservants, long separated from music and companionship, will use the excuse of burning incense and lighting candles to create opportunities for mischief once they watch a lewd play. Even poor serving girls, orphaned at an early age, will expose their shame by engaging in immoral behavior like the women of Qi in Sang Zhong once they watch a lewd play. Even nuns, who should be cultivating purity and chanting scriptures, will let their thoughts stray from worldly affairs once they watch a lewd play, and their chanting will sound more like the calls of flower sellers. Even monks, who are supposed to be impartial and just, will violate the rules and regulations once they watch a lewd play, turning their scripture halls into towers of longing for spring. Even celebrating birthdays and honoring deities become occasions for lewd plays, so when will this harm ever end? I imagine that benevolent gentlemen who sponsor moral plays are accumulating merit, but what about those who love to sponsor lewd plays? Do they think it's entertaining? Or do they think it is harmful?</p>

<h3 id="e118">The Necessity of Lying <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>— Editor</p>
<p>In a discussion about children's lying, we discovered two facts that had previously escaped our attention:</p>
<p>We found that there is a correlation between family circumstances and children's lying. Children from poor families lie more often than children from affluent families. Our research revealed that this is not because poor children are less moral, but because this unequal society increases their need to lie.</p>
<p>Another startling fact is that girls lie more often than boys on average. This is certainly not because girls have less moral strength than boys. We suspect that this may again be because women's social status is lower than men's in this male-centered society, thus increasing their need to lie.</p>
<p>We believe that children's lying cannot be considered a sin, and is fundamentally not a moral issue, but rather a psychological and child education issue.</p>
<p>When you discover that your young children are lying, there is no need to be at a loss or make a fuss. Just calmly investigate the reasons for their lying, casually study their psychology behind lying, and then decide on a course of action.</p>
<p>The responsibility for children's lying often does not lie with the ignorant children themselves; children's lying is often attributable to parents and guardians.</p>
<p>We must minimize the need for children to lie.</p>

<h3 id="e119">The Power of Self-Control <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>— Cao You</p>
<p>In daily life, we often find that friends become enemies, couples separate, and families become unhappy, often due to one or two uncontrolled words. Although these words may seem insignificant, they can sometimes be a serious blow! If we want to avoid creating unnecessary tragedies, we must all exercise self-control over our behavior and speech.</p>
<p>When you read biographies of great people, you will naturally discover that many great figures in history suffered great setbacks and hardships in their youth due to a lack of self-control. However, they later repented and reformed, so that every word and action came from the heart, and they exercised self-control over all their behavior, eventually reaching a state of noble character, receiving the support of the masses, and becoming great figures in history. Abraham Lincoln in America is a prominent example. From this, we can also know that the power of self-control is not innate, but is the result of training. The great German poet Goethe said: "I want to be the master of myself." Indeed, you can make yourself a patient and content person, but at the same time, you can also make yourself a complaining and restless person. We can all develop our own personality and make it a happy one. But you can also make your own mind unhealthy. No one in the world has a temperament that does not need to be restrained, and no temperament is bad, as long as it is cultivated, it will become a good temperament.</p>
<p>A person with high moral values who can often exercise self-control is mostly based on family training in his youth. Other important factors include physical and mental health, good companions, and high education. Therefore, those who are parents should use reasonable methods to teach their children, so that they develop patience, peace, and contentment, and should also maintain their physical and mental health in harmony, and should make them understand that a pure life, a kind heart, and pleasant happiness are far better than a doctor's medicine!</p>
<p>The power of self-control has great benefits for those who are in business or in a political career. Those who run a business cannot expect to succeed without the power of self-control! A successful businessman is often a patient person with a good temper. How can there be patience without self-control? Those who embark on a political career cannot expect others to obey them if they do not have self-control themselves. Only those who can control themselves are qualified to manage and command others!</p>
<p>The power of self-control can be said to be essential for everyone. In a city full of sights and sounds, young people can easily go astray, lose their personality, and harm their lives if they do not have self-control! Only those who have self-control can embark on the road to success in the world.</p>

<h3 id="e120">A Dull Life <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>— Lan Dian</p>
<p>It must be because of the tension in Hong Kong this time! I remember many estranged friends again, you, are also one of those distant friendships!</p>
<p>How is life? - After being apart for so long, it is inevitable to ask this question.</p>
<p>For me, life is really like a turbid river, flowing slowly, and life is in it, like a pile of rotten mud. I really don't want to tell my friends, especially old acquaintances who haven't had any news for a long time, about my life, but I can tell you this: compared to the past, I am much healthier, and will you feel relieved by this?</p>
<p>But even I have come to believe that in this whole long year, life has been dull!</p>
<p>I have some worries, some longings, and some yearnings for the distant South, wouldn't you believe that I have these worries, longings, and yearnings? Really, even I am doubting myself, every day, I worry about losing a heart that has shaken my faith, I also long to pursue a more beautiful and good faith, and also, I can't help but feel some yearnings for the long-lost scenery of the South and my old friends, especially her, our Sophia, she must be very happy now!</p>
<p>Would you hate it if I brought up your old words again? A year ago, you said in a letter: "This is an era of suffering, we are young people, and life is a difficult and complex lesson." Today, are we still in this era of suffering? I feel some uncomfortable ease, and people are all enjoying themselves happily. This doesn't seem like an era of suffering (does it?). We should still be young! However, life, for me, is not a difficult and complex lesson, but rather like a peaceful dream, day after day, flowing past from the bottom of the turbid river, life, without liveliness, without laughter, only the ancient monotony and the dullness!</p>
<p>Would you care about me because of this?</p>
<p>It's just that you haven't been to this "isolated island" paradise, where countless young hearts have turned ice-cold.</p>
<p>Just believe it! Many young people are like this; in their warm lives that have been lost, they also have some worries, some longings, and some yearnings for the distant motherland.</p>
<p>The days will continue to flow like this, and life will be the same, but will the days temper us to be strong? Do you believe that a flash of lightning will flash in the dark storm and rain? It is certain.</p>
<p>Then, our life is not forever trapped in the dullness.</p>
<p>The Detective Hawthorne Case</p>
<h3 id="e121">The Dancer's Fate <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>— By Cheng Xiaoqing</p>
<p>Chapter Four: Several Speculations</p>
<p>"After midnight yesterday, probably around one o'clock, so you can say it's today. Sir, what kind of person is he? We also found him very strange. Did he do anything?"</p>
<p>Hawthorne didn't answer his question, just asked himself, "What did you find strange about him?"</p>
<p>"He came back in the rain last night, and as soon as he came back, he packed his luggage, paid the bill, and went out. I offered to carry his briefcase, but he didn't want it. He carried the briefcase himself to the elevator. That's why I thought his actions were a little strange."</p>
<p>I felt my heart rate increase. Because the bellboy not only confirmed Zhao Boxiong's identity, but also confirmed that his actions last night did indeed have the possibility of committing the crime. How could I restrain myself from secretly rejoicing when I unexpectedly obtained this unexpected information?</p>
<p>Hawthorne further asked, "Did he look flustered when he left?" The bellboy widened his eyes and nodded, "Yes, he was indeed flustered! After he came back, he didn't say a word, just took care of packing his briefcase; he left as soon as he was packed. I had long suspected that he wasn't on the right path."</p>
<p>"Then, do you know where he moved to?"</p>
<p>"Of course not. I asked him if he wanted me to call a car, but he just shook his head and didn't say a word. Sir, what did he do after all? I had long suspected him."</p>
<p>"Oh, you had long suspected him? Why?" At this time, a man who looked like a pot-bellied merchant, wearing a long gown, a woolen cap, and black beard and glasses, swaggered over from the east end of the corridor. The bellboy seemed a little apprehensive, pursed his lips at Hawthorne, and walked towards the turn at the west end. Of course we followed him, and he whispered in a relatively quiet turning point at the west end exit.</p>
<p>"Sir, there are several things that made me suspicious. Although he lives here alone, he has many friends who come to see him—"</p>
<p>"What kind of people are they?"</p>
<p>"I don't remember clearly. There are people wearing both Chinese-style clothes and Western suits, but they are not very old."</p>
<p>"Does he have a girlfriend?"</p>
<p>"Yes - there is one, and she has stayed overnight here." (67)</p>

<h3 id="e122">The Highest Institution of Learning in India <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>— Tao</p>
<p>Santiniketan University in India is located in Santiniketan, and its president is the current Indian poet laureate, Tagore. It used to be just a small school, but after decades of Tagore's management, it has become the world-renowned highest institution of learning in India today.</p>
<p>There are no classrooms in this university; students live in the woods, in clusters of small huts. Several dozen of them form a group, choosing one person to be their leader. When the morning bell rings, they immediately get up, salute the sun, then bathe under the banana trees. After half an hour, they put on white robes, carefully wrap their textbooks in a white cloth, and run to the pre-selected tree. That is their classroom, and the professors are already sitting under the tree waiting for the students' arrival. When the students are all present, they form a semicircle and sit cross-legged on the ground, beginning their lessons amidst the songs of birds and the fragrance of flowers. Most strangely, during class, if students have any questions, even if they are not in the textbook, they can interrupt the professor and stand up to ask. The teachers will also answer as fully as possible. Such seemingly rude behavior from the students is not only not punished, but can even earn the teacher's praise.</p>
<p>Wednesday is their Sabbath, so on this day, the students put on colorful robes and happily run to the temple to worship. Everyone is barefoot, sitting on the floor. President Tagore arrives at the temple gate by car, also takes off his straw sandals, puts on a long robe, and enters. He first sits on a stool and performs a peculiar ritual, then reads the Bible, and then interprets the words of the Bible for the students.</p>
<p>Currently, Santiniketan University has more than eight hundred students. After graduation, they work in twenty-eight countries around the world. Those who graduate and stay in India have been distributed to about a thousand villages!</p>
<h3 id="e123">Opportunity <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>— Huang Meicun</p>
<p>When there is no opportunity, create opportunity; when opportunity arises, seize it; never give up opportunity, because opportunity waits for no one. But we must also not wait for opportunity.</p>

<h3 id="e124">The Mystery Film That Was Thought to Be ### "The Great Dictator" Filming Anecdotes <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>— Shu Mang</p>
<p>Three Years of Diligent Work Finally Completed / Subtle Portrayals That Are Both Hilarious and Tragic</p>
<p>We have heard about Chaplin's new film "The Great Dictator" for a long time, but during this long period, we have only heard the sound of the escalator but not seen anyone come down. This has made open-minded movie fans all over the world look forward to it with great anticipation. Until recently, Chaplin personally announced that the film has been completely shot and will be premiered in the United States in mid-September. For this film, Chaplin mobilized all the staff of the studio, from actors to craftsmen, working diligently for three years. In addition to countless efforts in the work, he also encountered many difficulties in the environment. Judging from the current situation here and the content of the film, it may be difficult for Shanghai audiences to see this film. Now, I will write down some inhumane trivial matters about the content of the film and all aspects of its production below, which may be what everyone wants to know.</p>
<p>(1) The title of this film has now been officially decided to be "The Great Dictator." However, in Chaplin's studio, everyone does not call it by its title, but refers to it as "Production No. 6."</p>
<p>(2) Chaplin speaks entirely in this film. He plays a small-mustached character that alludes to Hitler, named Adenoids Hinp, meaning "adenoid growths," while Jack Oakie, who plays 　Solini, is named Benzino gasoline in the film, meaning "oil and gasoline," which also means "inflammable material" and "troublemaker."</p>
<p>(3) In addition to Hitler and Mussolini, others such as Goebbels and Goering also appear, and each has incredibly subtle allusive pseudonyms. As for Stalin, he does not appear in the film and there is no allusion to him. According to Chaplin's explanation, this is because he could not find someone whose appearance was similar to his.</p>
<p>(4) Paulette Goddard is still the heroine in this film. She plays a female singer who later becomes Hitler's lover.</p>
<p>(5) During the three-year production process, Chaplin received more than 500 threatening letters from certain parties, as well as many other forms of threats. Because of this, all the staff of the film, from Chaplin downwards, have a considerable amount of accident insurance. In addition to hiring armed guards around the studio, no one is allowed to enter for a visit. In addition to preventing accidents, it is said that there is also a "business eye" effect involved.</p>
<p>(6) Chaplin has strictly blocked the stills, discarded footage, and even production news of this film. Before the official release, absolutely no snippets of the film are allowed to be leaked to the outside world.</p>
<p>(7) Chaplin's efforts for this film exceed any of his past films. He not only wrote, directed, and starred in it, but also created the entire film's musical score himself.</p>
<h3 id="e125">Recent News of Hollywood Stars <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>— Sha</p>
<p>Deanna Durbin stipulates that she works eight hours a day in the studio, but before going to the studio, she must first prepare her daily homework. As for Saturday, that belongs to her lover, Von Paul. On this whole day, Miss Durbin must go out with him.</p>
<p>Mitzi Mayfair has become very popular since she first showed her talent in "Rain." Now, Miss Mayfair wants to introduce her lover, Olivera, to the film industry. It is said that this Mr. Varda has recently undergone a "screen test," and it is likely that we will see the demeanor of Mitzi Mayfair's lover on the screen in the near future.</p>
<p>The Lane family has a total of four daughters, in addition to Priscilla Lane, Rosemary Lane, and Lola Lane who have long served in the film industry, now their eldest sister Leota Lane has also moved from the stage to the screen, so now it is no longer a family of three talents but has added another talent.</p>
<p>Alice Faye was very depressed after divorcing her husband. Because she didn't want to be reminded of the past, she put the house in San Fernando Valley where she used to live with Tony Martin up for sale.</p>
<p>Skating queen Sonja Henie　 (after the athlete Don Topping, the two took a honeymoon trip and recently returned from Hawaii. Don Topping was originally a famous financier, and now he has married this shrewd and frugal wife, so he has the hope of becoming a Hollywood billionaire in the future.</p>
<p>Vivien Leigh's fiancé (they will marry on August 6), Laurence Olivier, has a strange temper, that is, he hates people calling him a "screen lover." However, for other actors, it is something they seek but cannot get.</p>
<p>It is really unfortunate news that Olivia de Havilland will leave her screen life after marrying James Stewart at the end of this year. This is a big blow to "Havilland fans."</p>
<h3 id="e126">The Standard Figure of a Female Star <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>— Jun Tao</p>
<p>We know that a woman's success as a star has a great relationship with her figure. At least one part of her must have ideal beauty. In terms of the whole body, then Marlene Dietrich, Jean Harlow, Ann Sheridan, etc. can all be said to have the most recently ideal beautiful figure, but they still do not meet the ideal standard. Therefore, various film companies are now searching for an ideal female star whose figure must have Dorothy Lamour's waist, Deanna Durbin's limbs, Dolores del Río's eyes, Loretta Young's mouth, Annabella's nose, Anita Louise's eyebrows, but they have not been able to find one for a while. As for when that will happen, we can only tell you readers at that time! Pan Licila Lane, Rosemary Lane, and Lola Lane have long served in the film industry. Now their eldest sister Leota Lane has also moved from the stage to the screen, so now there are four talents instead of three talents in the family.</p>
<h3 id="e127">Interesting Things While Watching a Play <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>— Cheng</p>
<p>The Shanghai Drama School has achieved remarkable results. Yesterday, I went to watch the school's rehearsals, and there were many interesting anecdotes, which I have recorded as follows: The plays performed that day were the complete "Four Plate Mountain" and "Eight Five Flower Cave." The actors were all wearing blue cloth uniforms. Guan Zhengming (male, 14 years old) played Si Lang, without wearing facial makeup, and wore green tiger-head military boots, while his fleshy legs were exposed; Gu Zhengqiu (female, 13 years old) played the princess, with two small braids hanging behind her head, and holding a wooden ruler to represent the child. A beardless Si Lang, paired with a braided princess, was a natural match. Zhou Zhengwen (female, 14 years old) played Empress Xiao. When she appeared, she was guarded by as many as thirty-four people (twenty-two males and twelve females), standing on both sides. The males all had shaved heads, and the females all had short hair. Empress Xiao had yellow court beads hanging around her neck, matched with a blue cloth cheongsam, sitting in the center, like an old Buddha. Zhu Zhengqin (female, 15 years old) played the Empress Dowager. Her hair was black and thick, so shiny that it could be used as a mirror. Zhou Zhengrong (male, 14 years old) played Liu Lang, wearing a pair of thick-soled shoes without shafts, resembling a monk. Peng Zhenglin (male, 14 years old) played Zong Bao, and Yang Zhengshan (female, 14 years old) played Jiao Furen, both bald and without makeup. Although the form was not beautiful, everyone sang and acted very hard, not being sloppy, even the extras running on stage were disciplined and did not have a perfunctory attitude, so the audience all concentrated their attention. "Eight Five Flower Cave" only performed the opening fight due to time constraints, and the sparring was very intense. This is really due to the effective coaching of the school principal Chen Chengyin and the teachers.</p>

<h3 id="e129">Ti Jie is About to Write and Direct Again ### "Mr. Wang Visits the Funeral Home" <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>— Feng</p>
<p>Ye Qianyu is famous in the art world for his "Mr. Wang" comics. I remember that the "Mr. Wang" in the Morning Post's Sunday supplement was really popular at the time. Later, Tang Jie, at Tianyi Company, cooperated with Ye Qianyu to bring "Mr. Wang" to the screen, which was of course also a sensation, hailed as the epitome of domestic comedies.</p>
<p>In the past two years, Tang Jie, at the National Union, in addition to playing roles in every film, the films he has starred in are mostly still self-written and directed "Mr. Wang."</p>
<p>Recently, in addition to performing as Qian Duqiao in "Miao Jin Feng" in the guise of "ancient costume Mr. Wang", he is also starting to write "Mr. Wang Visits the Funeral Home." In addition to the consistent comedic style, the film also has detective and horror scenes. It is expected that the film will start shooting at the end of this month.</p>
<h3 id="e130">Bai Yang in the Air Raid Shelter ### "Seizing the Time" <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>— Xing</p>
<p>Bai Yang recently sent a letter from Chongqing to a friend in Shanghai, briefly saying that she has not been filming or acting recently, and is quite idle, but there are alarms every day, so it is also quite lively. She also said that whenever an alarm comes, she usually hides in the air raid shelter, with a bundle of wool in her hand, doing some work. She said this is called "seizing the time!" As for the matter of returning to Shanghai, she did not mention it.</p>
