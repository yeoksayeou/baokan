<h3 id="c2">問題的義國與法國 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>凡百人事的開展，極難得走直綫，而一波三折倒是尋常現象。今天又有足聳聽聞的消息了，不妨視爲世界變局容或急轉直下的朕兆；然而容或祗是波折，即使由此朕兆而演進，亦得想見前途還有不少波折。</p>
<p>冷靜些說，現在還談不到急轉或波折；因爲所謂世界變局到現階段爲止，化大化惡，究竟到了巓峰沒有？種種方面化爲更大，化爲更惡，正有其無數的可能；儘化之不已，則事實上離巔峰尙遠尙遠；而近頃各方面所警戒，所準備，所籌畫，乃至所議論的，允無非對付更大更惡乃至於其巔峰。論事觀變的思維，却又不應閉着眼睛走直綫。一如德國東攻西擊，勢如破竹，無戰不勝，更一舉而摧敗了號稱世界一强的法蘭西之後，又乘勝進襲英國；但是現在至少已經證明了閃電戰略制勝英國的不可能，又證明了英國武力轉强，形勢轉好，一如義國威震南歐洲，氣吞地中海·越沙漠·破英軍·長驅而入埃及；視希臘如枯朽，誇稱三星期足以了之；但是現在希臘反攻而深入阿爾巴尼亞，英國反攻而迭破利比亞要塞，斬殺俘獲各以萬千計。德國的進襲英國，義國的入埃及攻希臘，安知非即德義大勝大利，稱雄稱覇的黃金時代；自此而後，或不僅無以復加，抑且無以爲繼。爾後檢討旣往，極可能的，當時德義聲勢乃爲事實上的巔峰。總之，現階段的世變究竟未到巓峰或已過巔峰，目前尙難斷言，亦即未許執一而遽作定論。這鑽研今天的消息之前，所應分別體認的。</p>
<p>所謂足聳聽聞的今天消息。據美國國際社華盛頓電，略謂：</p>
<p>『昨日此間官方宣稱，美將急命駐義法兩大使，於假滿後，立即赴任。據透露，駐義大使費力普斯，將返抵羅馬；李海海軍大將，將就任新駐法大使之職。衆信美政府或將準備與義法兩國元首會商，並加以援助，且或將加以壓力，使兩國不致過又德國之支配。此間觀察家指稱，義法兩國，現迫切需要糧食，及其他供應品。美政府或將以此項糧食供給義法，且以接濟品運渡大西洋。美政府此項宣言，已引起外交界方面之騷動，外交界方面以爲，羅馬人士旣因軍事上之挫折，及方興未艾之經濟危機，感覺失望，則自樂於接受停止戰事。來自土國之消息稱，義大利旣有逐漸傾向和平之態度，則英議間之休載，自「十分可能」。外交界人士，卽以此消息，與美政府之宜言，同時加以硏究，法國自降服以還，美駐法大使迄今虛懸，美政府乃派遣李海大將擔任此職，而美與維希政府之關係，將更形改善。此問咸認賴伐爾係納粹手中之工具，最近法政府之改組，似係貝當允帥以其權力，壓服賴氏，因此美法兩國政府間，已引起史大之信任心云。』</p>
<p>在這電訉之中，叙述的事實少，介紹的見解多：凡所稱述，祗是或然，並非必然。若目前所「或然」，到往後竟「果然」，則世變在事實上已過了巓峯；雖無望於急轉直下，然是極關重耍的轉變；雖不免於一波三折。然是可望收拾的朕兆。雖然，這些在現在，還祗是假定而已。</p>
<p>假定這些確已成爲問題了。就問題中的法義兩國而論，有關義國的活動角度大，有關法國的活動角度小。法國維希元首貝當老將軍的罷黜賴伐爾，證明貝當還不是德國十足的傀儡而俯仰由人。亦不是賴某個人的工具而擺佈由人，因此，英美等方面頓然感受了良好印象。希臘與北非兩地戰事。確予世界全局以極深刻的影響，允必使維希貝當以决的心理上發生極微妙的作用；因此，英美等方面觸發了近距離的期待。這些印象與期待，不算虛無縹渺，我們不應以此爲英美傳統的樂天而視爲可哂；然大勢所示，倘非德國遭遇了嚴重的新困難，義國自己承認了決定的失敗，則不問貝當的抱負如何，而貝當現在在事實上所担當的角色，總還脫不了德國的傀儡與親德派的工具。亦即不問貝當而今而後的心理如何，對英如何，對美如何，不問美國能怎樣接濟法國，派誰何駐在法國，維希還是不能躱避德國壓力，更遑論擺脫德國支配而助成世局的轉變。正相反，大局趨勢愈不利於德而利於英，則很可能的，德國對法國愈扣愈緊。使維希成爲十足的傀儡，十足的工具，不能動彈。所謂法國與所謂維希，二者之間應如何分別體認。那是另一問題，然維希政權目前非親德不能存在，則無疑問。故美國方面目前雖已視法國爲可成問題，而所得活動的角度，必不甚大。</p>
<p>至於義國，以其遭遇旣成爲自身的大問題，遂亦得成爲世變前途的大問題。上引國際社電訉所述軍事方面異常嚴重的挫折，問題一；經濟上方興未艾的危機，問題二；國內之傾向和平的態度，問題三：此外，爲匈牙利與南斯拉夫諸國，與義國爲近水樓臺，連日頻傳德國密遣大軍五萬餘人，陸續開入義境，問題四。第一問題，事實昭彰。第二問題，義國原來不足自給，絕對依存於地中海小受封鎖而得暢受接濟。第三問題，義國的民族性愛好和平，今乃從事於擴展的流血，况發動於法西斯治而非民治，出兵不利而未一勝。這三點的成問題，眞是愛莫能諱；所不可知者，究竟其影響業已嚴重到如何程度？倘各戰局竟得倏轉優勢，則猶得希望倒挽在瀾，吾則目前即使未甚嚴重，亦必已日趨嚴重而終於異常嚴重；而前電所稱「英義間之休戰自十分可能」，我們不能視爲英美傳統的樂天之一徵。至於第四點，德軍開入義境問題，確吾還待續報，然而問題的嚴重性却不在確與吾；質言之，確了則爲嚴重同題，不確亦爲嚴重問題。確了，則體察希特勒先生的天賦根性，分析納粹帝國主義的基本精神，根據稱雄稱霸，天無二日的一般原則，德國大軍到了義境，將不問明的如何標榜，暗的如何諾言，此其後果必爲大大問題。不確，則希臘軍隊雖僅在阿爾巴尼亞有如生龍活虎，英國軍隊雖僅在利比亞有如在風怒潮，迄今皆未踏入義大利本國國土一步；然而幾路大敗的消息，成千成萬死亡失踪被俘的惡耗，傷兵的源源歸來，這些必然已經輸入義國國境，灌注義人耳目。打動朝野心坎了；不有强援，如何得了？即使民間懵無所知，墨索里尼不能不知；不有强援，如何得了？在若此情况之下，若說同盟的德國熟視無覩，竟然不發一兵一卒，豈不又是大大問題？義國所遭遇的問題若此，不能無爲而治，不藥而愈吧！如何治，如何愈，或因此而如何促成了變局的更大更惡，要無不影響世界的整個變局。</p>

<p>英國自遭受德國空軍的閃電戰攻擊以來，通常的戰時生活爲之劇變，正像承平之世的正規生活給戰事摧殘一般。男子被徵入伍服兵役，屋宇遭受炸彈的擊毀，任何人一到晚問只有株守在家中，或睡在地室及防空壞裹。一般家庭生活亦大爲改觀，小孩子們都已疏散到鄉村之間。無論貧富老少都受了戰事的極大影響。</p>
<p>英王和英后，也和老百姓一樣，慣聽炸彈飛噓之聲，窗玻璃豁朗的倒下來，或墻壁上的堊粉紛紛傾落，他們也一樣的感到地板在那里震動。白金罕宮至少已被八棵炸彈擊中，或在附近爆發，至於掉在宮院草地上的尙不計算在內。宮中的游泳池已被炸壞，禮拜堂亦已毀損。王和后私邸的窗戶都經震坍，庭院中被炸了許多的窟窿，欄杆亦已殘缺。有一個炸彈正投在王和后的辦公室附近，相去不過咫尺。英后知道轟炸下的結局，正和她的臣民所知道的一樣。</p>
<p>爲了戰事的緣故，英后的日常生活自然大爲變更。一方面這對於她倒也可喜的，因爲在作戰期中，一切社交和各種儀節都吿停止。旣不上朝，也不出巡，宴會也都結束。在這種塲合之下，主后向來是母儀天下的，然而論其實際，她並不以爲樂。</p>
<p>她最感關切的是英國百姓——他們怎樣的生活，怎樣與戰事相搏擊。因此，王后的責任雖因戰事而增重了許多，但是她得有更多的機會與百姓接近，獲得更多的時間，去從事她所心喜的活動。每天早晨，她總先在書室中規劃一切，飯後至少有一决，有時候多至四五次，往醫院，急救站，飲食間，救護所，或其他婦女工作的塲所去視察。</p>
<p>自從倫敦遭受轟炸以來，王后的每天起居行動受了一種變更。每天早晨，最後一决的轟炸地點必先報告宮內。王和后根據這種呈報，就揀了一處受災最重的地方，去巡視慰問。因此受了轟炸，嚇得目瞪口呆的貧民區住戶，當他們在一夜之間變爲瓦爍塲之中找尋遺物時，往往看見王后翩然蒞止，在斷垣焦木中跨越而來，以笑顏向他們，對大家表示慰問。德國空軍第一决對英發動閃電戰的一天早晨，英王和后驅車直放東區，那里曾遭德機猛烈轟炸。御駕所至，人民嵩呼者再。這種巡幸災區之舉，裨益非淺，因爲道可表示於老百姓，他們的王和后，和他們同樣的站在前綫呀？</p>
<p>空襲之下的白金罕宮和倫敦其他各大機關一樣。屋頂上裝了聽音機，探照燈，不時在高空之中掃射照耀。附近守望區之處，還裝了警報機，一見飛機臨頭出現時，便警報大鳴，這和普通　報不同，一聞到這種緊急警報時，宮中人員，連英王和英后在內，完全跑入避彈室，祇留着一隊空襲警戒員在地面上守護着。</p>
<p>宮中的避彈室設備和普通房子下所建者相仿，並不見得格外安全。這種防空室大都就地室或儲藏間改造搭了木架，多堆些沙包，並不深入地下。像這樣的防空室，在倫敦一般富室之家，到處可見。</p>
<p>王后在白畫外出之時，途中雖遇警報，仍不改變行程，好像對於空襲有不理睬的樣子，除非飛機已翔翱在上，她決不先躱入防空室。這可說，她所能遭受的危險，雖不比一般倫敦人爲多，但也是隨時可以遭遇到的。倫敦的高空中，往往有單獨的飛機出現雲端，他們都把引擎的聲音停閉着。世界上任何最精緻的飛機探索器，都沒有方法把他們的聲音尋出來。這種德國飛機，往往穿出雲端，直降而下，向閙市之中，施放炸彈，或以機槍射擊。有時候遭遇這種飛機襲擊時，並不聞到空襲警報。但是英后正和仟何英國人一樣，不顧頭頂上飛機如何在那里威脅着，她手頭所進行着的工作決不因而中止。她還是若無其事的進行一切，和英倫三島上的任何一位女太太相仿彿。（未完）</p>

<p>衆業股市承上日漲勢、情况愈演愈烈、全日上落頗大、此蓋由於鋼業公司宜佈將發五　股息、及發行新股（每股十元、每一老股可得一新股）、該股成交最多、價較前日計漲十元之譜、會德豐一度亦見九十三元高價、情和啤酒成交亦夥價爲七元二角、所有實業股俱被惠及而吿上漲、橡皮股潛勢亦堅、價格略有進步、</p>
<p>按英商會德豐洋行經理之鋼業有限公司、決定續收新股二五〇·〇〇〇股每股認購價格、定爲國幣十元、將以明年一月三日之股東名册爲根據、由老股東按股分認、老股可認新股一股云、</p>

<p>紗市發現新高峯後、又轉回風、此因泰半盈利者出節、以致籌碼稍鬆、市態下降、同時實際交易大為减少、所以浮多大都傾向了結、惟外匯縮風復起、及黃金昂貴、外客依然進多而出少也、不過有一部份人云、二十支雜牌紗價、未免較爲便宜、予雙馬相差距離太遠也、今日有棉紗三百六十件運香港、</p>
<p>雙馬晨開、因上日午後多頭大爲活動、在外搜羅殷切、已抬至一千三百四十八元、今晨議論紛紜、謂黃金暗盤大升，人心一致望高、首盤價爲一千三百五十二元、此盤一開、而買奢叢集、叫喊聲振盪戶外、直升至一千三百五十五元、豈料盈利多頭、乘機巨量出檔、致檯面稍鬆、在一千三百五十元至三四元、往返有數次之多、但金子帮因匯票軟化、拖拉允烈、卒以大戶吐出、額子較夥、市盤回落一步、跌至一千三百三十七元、迨至十一時、外匯風頭殊緊、回上至一千三百四十五元收盤、查半日間成交統計五千六百三十包、行情一十支雙馬漲五元、茲將各帮口買去之額最錄左、</p>

<p>午後紗市續帶平象、二十支雙馬價始做一千三百四十　元、繼爲一千三百四十一元、</p>
<p>棉巿寗靜</p>
<p>現械情况仍無特色可言、廠方亦乏大最的發展、所以仍在寗靜穩固之境耳、火機價一百〇一元、常陰沙二百十六元、巴西棉價二百八十二元、白洛去二百三十三元、</p>

<p>廠布昨市堅昂、人氣熱烈蓋以東疋漲風續厲、本廠細布·斜紋以外銷阻滯·售盤仍形低廉、故回業及染廠納胃漸增、手貨緊俏，售盤步步抬高、實貴細布晨開三十五元五角、後步漲至三十六元、餘檔亦漲二角半至七角半、細斜漲二角半至五角、粗布坯布漲二角半至五角、漂染布漲五角左右、本街成交各布　千六百餘件、浙路溫甬台幫辦溧布、粗細布、色布三百餘件、粵港幫辦粗細布·色布·漂布·府綢等五百餘件、間幫辦色布、色斜近百件、疋頭二十日運香港六百十件、</p>
<p>東布漲勢甚猛、中檔細布狂跳每疋一元外、龍頭細布漲八角牛、最高盤做開三十八元七角、收盤時三十八元六角、細斜升漲每疋五角、嗶嘰一元一角五分、則僅漲每碼一分、良以時令關係、買戶缺乏故也、</p>

<p>意大利呢羢，近來已有急轉直下之勢、申存日缺、走銷亦淡、其最著名之四萬一千號及七千號和四萬號一萬四千號幷一萬八千號之花呢哈維、明年勢將絕跡於市、盡自歐戰發生、洋行定價俱改美金、且多數非先收定洋三四成不可、兵險外費奇昂、合算成本幾與英國貨相等、而其到埠有年無月、新近意輪絕對不能駛滬，貨運斷絕、而大半又爲申織本廠貨所紡製、照一般心理、意國呢羢售價、須比英製者爲略廉、日貨呢羢、又須比意製爲便宜、本廠貨呢羢必須比日製者爲再賤、吾則銷路必有大礙、此乃牢不可破之事　也、昨七千號售價每碼法幣三十七八元、四萬二千號售二十六七元、較之一月前行情未有升降、足見冷落一斑、</p>

<p>洋米自經實施限價、連續兩朝呈擯持之狀、蓋途貨旣接踵到埠、定貨並不因匯縮而中止成交、昨日新交易續有長義拋出二月份小絞一千噸、價爲八十一元、其他接洽求妥者亦有多起、且昨市國米已銳落一二元、昨晨開市、人心略平、似有下落之勢、若二號紅寳塔曾有依限開出、其他雜牌二號已跌進限盤一元光景、開八十元零五角、大市火絞開八十四元、八十三元半、孰料經此一貶、突有浮囤急起直取一時形勢復返栗落、喊聲　昂、致一線曙光頓被陰靈所寵罩、再達限盤呈檳待之舊狀、蓋以洋米已成爲人衆唯一養命之源、囤戶遂目爲大利所在、絲毫不放鬆、逢棧必進、有貨必拖、而至米價易漲難跌、虎狼之心罪浮於率獸食人、因之行市一伏一起、仍爲無榮無辱之局、計一號西貢八十七元、二號八十一半、决至八十元零五角、火絞八十五元至八十三元半、二號暹羅八十元、七十九元半、小紋七十九元、七十八元半、米茶七十七元半、七十七元、碎特自七十五元、决至七十元、蕪湖尖七十八元、七十七元七角、二號西貢十二月份、建源貨初開八十四元、繼爲八十三元半、又一月份合中八十六咒、小絞日信十二月九號九十一元、又一月份八十一元半至八十一元、全日開出原包九六百噸、現貨不足三千包、</p>
<p>厚薄粳等國米到貨雖積有限、無如米價一再暴漲價格之貴、殊非一般半民所能負祖、國米一項已成爲貴族之食品、因之店舖門市採購者洋米居多、對於國米去路寥寥、在連帶關係之下、市上銷塲遂亦淸淡異常、所以一般貨主、欲扳無縱、况見市勢環境惡劣、均求鬆脫、然終難邀出胃、於是驟落二三元不等、計開崑山斛見白粳爲九十六七元、眞特別一百零一元、一百元靑角薄稻斛見八十八元、八十七、</p>
<p>糯米去路、終以輔助之品、難能連　致一般囤收者覺利簿危多、均思脫手但心思相同是、你鬆吾亦鬆、頓時造成競售之風、何如銷塲滯澀難覓封手、結果行情雖削一二元、成交則依然寥寥、若宜溧　開九十四元、香港白元高貨已開八十三四元、普通者僅八十三元至八十元左有、</p>

<p>粉市廠盤、仍爲十八元、平賣粉加價問題、尙未得當局同意、故暫無變動、洋粉市面、被雜糧公會禁止投機貿賣後、市塲交易、已吿絕跡、惟塲外交易、尙不寂寞、計開野猪牌澳洲粉二十一元六角、花鳥鐘樓牌二十一元二三角、比前已見　三四角、統市由本客成交五千餘包、至平賣粉雖未增價、而各廠以生產銳减兼阜　廠又有罷工消息、故兩廠批出數量、更不敷本街之需用云、</p>
<p>小麥交易、仍乏開展、各貨存到兩枯、日廠與華廠均無法暢辦、而貨方莫不居奇扳情、而昨日米粉市情已轉軟化、故華廠進價亦限定三十一元、日廠猶在醒釀、暫無正式做開、</p>

<p>美對輯里絲需要很人、奈上海無絲應市耳、美白廠絲存底很多、日絲銷路很成問題、故據英文金融商業報云、日本正在中國淪陷區中、伐去桑樹、擬使中國不能再產生絲、而專種棉花、以滿足他自己的需要、該報謂、如此項計劃實現、則華中地帶之產絲區、絲業將着根斬去、如要復興、必須挨諸五六十年之後、如此說來、近傳「華中」公司停發生絲出口之事、亦可覓得一項原因矣、但桑田有百分之八十在游擊區、故日方欲根本摧毀華絲之陰謀、甚少實現可能也、</p>

<p>日軍自將大西路汪家弄內汪家村房屋拆毀、限令三百餘戶居民遷移、致有千餘人流離失所後、昨日復將繞有鐵絲網之木柵、全日將該弄封鎖、由備警三名守衛、居民旣不得入內、卽在木柵外與弄內未及遷出之居民叙話、亦遭干涉、至諸安浜居民、大部已遷出、在咋日上午七時至下午五時間、進出者甚少、又韜朋路上日軍醫野村被刺後、其附近民房、日方亦仿照在滬西施行之苛酷辦法、將民房拆毀、開闢新路、茲誌各情如次、</p>
<p>韜朋路上　又拆民房</p>
<p>英文大美晚報云、本星期一日午後、曾有日軍醫野村、在公共租界北區韜朋路被刺、今日（十九日）該地附近有日海軍陸戰隊督率華工百餘人、拆毀民屋的五十椽、致華籍居民三百餘人、頓吿流離失所、蓋日方又在該地闢造新馬路矣、預料日方將在該地賡續强拆民屋、屆時被迫遷出、無家可歸居民、將達一千人之多、</p>
<p>殆將開闢　野村馬路</p>
<p>查本年九月下旬起、上海日軍人被刺者、已有十三人、其中兩憲兵名佐佐木與齋藤者、在西區遭晤殺、日方乃在該區新闢兩路築成後卽以「佐佐木路」與「齋藤路」名之、今又在北區闢第三條新馬路、或亦將取名爲「野村路、」日方於星期日被捕之華人、傳係刺野村之主犯、惟日當局對此、今晨仍守緘默、聞該華人係在華成路與濟寗路間某衖內被日海軍陸戰隊所捕、另有數人、身畔藏槍、同遭拘捕、</p>
<p>獲剌客說　未能證實</p>
<p>上海泰晤士報云、日方海軍陸戰隊現已加緊搜査星期一午後在韜朋路華德路口擊斃日軍醫野村中尉之刺客一人、外傳逸入濟寗路旁某村失蹤之刺客已被捕獲之說、昨日（十九日）未獲證實、日官方人士吾認星期二被捕之嫌疑犯已經認明爲此案主犯、惟稱日方根據第一批被捕者之言、可望捕獲其他嫌疑犯、以便盤問、警方亦稱不知日方大肆搜査之發展如何、同時、聞日方追擊刺客時、流彈擊傷之華童一人、經送入楊樹浦醫院、從左臀箝出槍彈後、傷勢漸見痊可、</p>
<p>人力車主　不願領照</p>
<p>上海泰晤士報云、「市府捐稅局」近曾宣布行駛於滬西界外馬路之一切單輛、須於本月十六日前向其登記捐照、違者不准入該區、然聞人力車前往登記者、數殊寥寥、而絕大多數人力車、汽車與卡車等、昨日（十八日）仍懸工部局照會、往來行駛、「市府」規定人力車照會每月十二元、人力車主則稱不欲領取新照、因目下西區人力車營業甚微、不値復出照會費十二元、又關於本市組織人力車專利公司之建議、人力車主與工部局代表進行談判、數日內可吿畢、至於工部局給予人力車特權、將畀以何種條件、未悉其詳、</p>
<p>警權協定　未具體化</p>
<p>英文大美晚報云、今日（十九日）外傳工部局與「市府」關於滬西界外馬路問題之談判、進行順利、惟據「市府」面稱、「市」當局尙朱硏究此事、本年二月間、工部局與「市府」所訂西區草的、不久諒將受「市　當局注意、但「市方迄未採取確實步驟云、査雙方警務首腦、近已擬定界外馬路區警務協定之詳則、各自呈交市政當局、作最後之考慮與簽子、</p>
<p>稅收情勢　並無變化</p>
<p>據工部局發言人聲稱、該局對於此事、正待「市」方覆文、相信此項問題，早日可獲解決、至於界外馬路區收稅情勢、仍無變化、外傳雙方俟商妥收稅問題後、始成立警務協定、與聯警隊之說、實屬不確、</p>
<p>曹家渡又突遭封鎖</p>
<p>畸形繁榮之滬西曹家渡、昨日起情形突然大變、針突變之由來、乃係前日傍晚六時、大批日軍及「警察」忽在曹家渡四週出動、並携有大枇鐵絲網、分頭在通達曹家渡之各要口、如（一）勞勃生路品、（二）極司非而路口、（三）白利南路口、（四）康腦脫路忻康里口、（五）五角塲極司非而路後路口、（六）極司非而路忻康里口等六處、架設路中、僅分出入口通行、鐵絲網側並駐有日憲兵及「警察」數名、由「警察」施行檢査過往行人、英商中國公共汽車公司之七路十路二路公共汽車、本均駛至曹家渡爲終點、當因極司非而路鐵絲網缺口狹小、而車身龐大、無法出入、故臨時改以新嘉坡路站爲終點、</p>

<p>美日雙方在遠東之無綫電戰、昨日（十九日）正在　釀中、蓋盛傳本市美商華美廣播電臺呼號XMHA因其播音節目、遭日方擾亂、已歷四日、除非日万立刻停止擾亂、則　美電臺對本市日方電臺、將施報復也、</p>

<p>華美電臺經理海萊氏稱、渠已聞上項消息、但不拒說明是吾擬加報復、海萊又稱、吾人當然決不就此甘休、但將奮鬥到底、以保衛美人權利、</p>
<p>美總領事　已提抗議</p>
<p>聞駐滬美領事已向日當局提出抗議、日方擾亂華美電臺之波長、據領署某員聲稱、美當局抗譏文中指出傳聞「此事責在日方、」故請日總領事供給詳報、並使擾亂中止、</p>
<p>糾紛之起　咎在日方</p>
<p>又海萊聲稱、華美電臺被擾、咎在日方無綫電管理處、渠曾接該管理處主仟來囪、請其限制華美電臺電力至二白瓦特、並將新聞送交日方檢査、然後加以廣播、衆意美日無綫電戰、如果發生、則本市日方兩電臺（呼號XQHA與XOJB）將無從播音、蓋美商電臺之發電機、力量强大、足使日方兩電臺同受擾亂也、</p>
<p>美發電機　可加報復</p>
<p>若無綫電戰愈演愈烈、則美方發電機能使日方在國外所設各電臺俱受擾亂、而華美電臺本身、亦能使東京專向美國·荷印·與馬來廣播之大電臺（呼號JOAK）無論發出長短波播昔、外界絲毫無從收聽、華美電臺今日之長波播昔、仍受干擾、短波播音，則可淸晰收聽、</p>

<p>上海泰晤士報云、本市航業界人士、昨日（十八日）紛紛談論盛傳大批挪威輪停租予日方之說、在此特殊戰時情况下、官方人士對於此說、旣不能加以證實、亦不能否認之、惟各界皆承認挪方此舉、在商業與政治兩方面、皆具重大意義、</p>
<p>停租消息未獲證實</p>
<p>査自德國佔據挪威後、挪政府卽遷倫敦、其直屬之挪威航運貿易委員會徵用全體挪輪直接加以統制、與英政府密切合作、如其他各協的國然、關於挪輪停租予日方一舉、上海尙無正式消息、蓋挪船之出租、乃申請人與挪威航運貿易委員會直接談判、然後轉　上海，今駐滬挪領署尙未接挪輪停租予日方之消息、僅能就挪輪之是吾來滬、測知其承租人有無變化、</p>
<p>此間各方予以重視</p>
<p>目下日方所租挪輪定期駛滬者僅兩艘、尙未見其轉移租戶、觀於邇來政局更變、而英挪政府連絡密切、且英國需要更多之商船、故一般人對於挪輪停租一說、頗予重視、日方所租挪輪之數目、未能確悉、但知其數頗夥、蓋日方本國船隻顯感短少、不敷戰時交通之用、租予日方之挪威運油船與貨船、行駛中國沿海者亦殊不少、如停租消息屬實、日方諒將提出强硬交涉、聞日方所租挪輪、多半將於三個月內租期屆滿、</p>

<p>申報杯中美慈善籃球錦標賽、中華隊自第一戰小挫後、昨晚刷新陣容、與美國隊作第一次之決戰於西靑籃球房、中華隊以最佳之陣錢出塲果然耳目一新、軍威大振、一路領先、美軍完全陷人慌亂之狀熊中、上半時中華隊以十三比八佔先五分、下半時中華隊之聲勢依然不衰、最盛時以二十六比十六佔先十分之多、中華隊表演之精彩、可謂空前、一時球塲空氣之緊張、幾達於白熱化、美國隊作困獸之鬥、亡命窮追、中華隊健將張少卿又於此最緊要之三分鐘時、被裁判勃拉脫以小故罰出、遂被美國隊最後連得四分、以三十八比三十五反敗爲勝、滿塲擁護中華隊之球迷及慈善家、莫小大爲扼腕、同聲嘆息、但成敗天也、非戰之罪也復何再哉、</p>
<p>決不灰心繼續奮鬥</p>
<p>中華隊昨以垂成之局、變化竟出於俄　之間、是試出乎萬分意料之外、上平時一路居先、中華隊下牛時以廿六比十六、領前達十分之多、以戰局之聲勢、全隊表演之佳美、聯絡之純熟而　、　精彩實可謂本李第一次之痛快表演、方以為勝利當無問題、結果竟再遭敗挫、是眞所謂命也運也、天敗我也、但中華隊決不悔心、第二戰決繼續奮鬥、以吐我氣、錦標得失、固其小也、尙望熱心球迷與慈善家、繼續擁護、爲中華隊出氣、</p>
<p>一路領先超出五分</p>
<p>中華隊昨以念華·少卿·學崇·南珍·震中出塲、美軍則先以淸一色之麥令白隊應戰、兩陣旣圓、華台爾以罰中打開紀錄、亨格爾錦上添花、美隊先以三分領導、相隔未久、馮念華籃下獻花、李震中隻手一托、中華隊立即以叫比三超出、迨亨格爾重入天台、美隊再見前導、念華隻手一托、華隊又見轉機、美軍方面、以默特萊、亭惠　相　調人、戰局仍無起色、陷於膠着狀熊者、達叫分鐘之久、在此時間、華隊浪擲甚多、失去必中之機者亦甚夥、比華台爾一罰一擲以後、美隊又第三度領先、但曇花一現、華軍卽節節勝利、念華學崇三兄連中、比分激增、刹那間已以十二比八、從此一路前導、迨孩兒而罰入、檸檬時屆、十三比八、中華佔先、</p>
<p>聲勢浩大光芒萬丈</p>
<p>易籃再戰、中華隊仍以原班人馬應戰、美軍亟調生力車登、指導克勞斯亦親蒞　敵、益以名將卡遜、班底則改以軍官隊爲基本、危險人物亨沙惠茲亦已出塲、戰鬥力較前判若天壞、交綏以後、張少卿立奏奇功、雙方淮展、形勢平平、但十九比十五以後、中華隊鋒芒大露、刹時間、少卿南珍三罰、念華兩擲頓增七分、美隊則僅卡　罰　一分、比數遂成廿六比十六、中華隊領先達　分之多、前途光明萬丈、必以爲黃　痛飲可期、歡呼雷動、是爲中華隊昨晚最盛時期、</p>
<p>功能敗垂成大局劇變</p>
<p>不圖變生肘腋、此最後之十分鐘、竟然急轉直下、當華台爾魯琦連珠鵠中、張少卿探得驪珠、二十比廿八、依然佔先八分、此時亨沙惠茲突向中央突破、王南珍迎頭攔阻、不料被射中之餘、又加兩罰、加以魯琦又中、一氣被增六分、遂成廿八比廿六之接近局面、中華隊禍不單行、張少卿又傷眼流血、活動不無影響、迨學崇少卿增加三分以後、辛普生雖被罰下、但虎去狼來、亭惠爾又　上戰綫、魯琦追成仕八比卅一、中華隊漸陷人危境、益作亡命之反攻、遂致少　於罰人一分後、竟內衝擅兩台爾而被罰出塲、　鍾恩雖調上、但匯台爾接連三罰、美隊已追至卅一比卅二、相差僅祗一分、壯際雖欲改守爲攻、已勢所不能、於是　沙惠茲一射以卅三比卅二後來居上、益以球神無靈、馮念　又失籃下必中之機、四座長嘆聲裏華台爾托入、球甫離籃鐘聲已鏜然而起、中華遂虧於一簧、以卅二比卅五再度慘敗、</p>

<p>老虎車雖慢，大概一小時也可以到達，但是等到十一時半，還不見到來，未免有點狐疑起來——天寒歲暮，老虎事夫一人送貨，不要生什麼岔子？一包米化洋錢幾十塊，可不是兒戲呀！</p>
<p>吃中飯的當兒，有人敲門，開門一看，一個苦力手拿一紙，紙上寫着我家的地址，我以爲米已經送到，便叫他扛進來；可是，探首門外一望，那裏有什麽車和什麽米，詢問之下，說：『米被戴平頂帽，執長槍的弟兄們扣住了，因爲送貨車上沒有印花，要叫貨主去。』明知道這是什麽同事，可是不去貨色就不能到手，所以只好限隨前去看事行事了。</p>
<p>米車被停在路旁，倒承蒙派了個「弟兄看守，相見之下，先得賠個笑臉，而後談判」就開始了。</p>
<p>『你是貨主嗎？』那「弟兄」劈口就這樣問。</p>
<p>『是！是！』我只有唯唯。</p>
<p>『米從那裏買來的？』</p>
<p>『××雜糧行買來的。』</p>
<p>『怎麽沒有發票？』</p>
<p>『因爲從棧房（堆棧）裏車出來，簽條已經交給棧房裏了，老虎車憑送貨條送貨，所以沒有發票。』</p>
<p>『怎麼又沒有印花，現在「上頭」「有命令」關照要査印花稅，沒有印花，是要罰錢的！』</p>
<p>『大概是店裏沒有知道這裏的規矩，漏貼了，能不能請「老鄉」馬虎點？』</p>
<p>『那不行！』</p>
<p>『噯……馬馬虎虎……』</p>
<p>『我可以馬虎，別的弟兄」不能馬虎——』</p>
<p>『請你幫幫忙！』</p>
<p>『可以幫忙的地方總歸幫忙，大家有「數，是不是？』</p>
<p>『當然！當然！於是我的手不禁伸進了袋裏，取出了兩張花紙，『這是點小意思，請「老鄉」和「弟兄」們吃枝香烟，小意思！對不住！對不住！幫幫忙！』</p>
<p>『好，好，下次不行！』</p>
<p>『是！是！』</p>
<p>承他「幫忙」，通過了這道大關，而我化去了兩隻洋，終得保全了一包白米，大幸！</p>
<p>繼續前進老虎車夫淌着汗，嘴裹却不住地代我嚷不平，他說：『拉了十幾年的老虎車，却從來沒碰到過這種事悄。』可是，事情却不僅此，又來了「巡察使」了，沒有徽章，沒有標記，僅穿了一身一老虎皮」，却也來査詢：發票？印花？仍舊是一套，我總算「識相」，在「握手」之下，再去了一張花紙，「對不住，　幫幫忙一也是一大套，方才過了二道大關。</p>
<p>好容易進了衖堂，米扛到了屋裏，開發車力兩元，酒錢五角，共計五元五角，但事已如此，只好自認晦氣。不過回頭想想，經歷到這一類的事情，也可以在無形中增加不少的「學問」。</p>

<p>— 顧明道</p>
<p>（五）鴛湖儷影</p>
<p>將近中午的時候，陳臥子送走了一位朋友，在他的小瑯環齋書室裏，手執一卷，焚香默坐。忽然書室人報，有客求見。陳臥子問是誰，可有名刺？書竄答道：「那來訪的客人沒有名刺，祇說是金陵侯方域公子那邊介紹來見的。」陳臥子本性傲慢，不喜接見外人，現聞侯方域所介，遂點點頭道：「請他進來。」不多時書童竟領進一個面如冠玉，服裝麗都的美少年，向他長揖爲禮。陳臥子一見這美少年雖然來得突兀，而容顏依稀似乎在那裏見過的，腦海裹一時想不出。便請少年上坐。書童獻過香茗。陳臥子遂向美少年叩問姓氏。美少年說道：「在下姓許名幻，素慕吾公大名，故凂侯公子爲介，特來拜見。」陳臥子道：「可有書信？」美少年搖搖頭道：本是有的，但在途中遺失了。並且此次來見吾公，還有一件緊要的事，侯公干要在下和吾公當面一說，可以不落痕跡。」陳臥子問道：「有什麽　？美少年道：「吾公爲天下名士，當有天下美人爲吾公紅袖添香，侍奉巾櫛。方今柳如是雖爲倡優賤畜之人，而知詩達體，貌美才高，爲巾幗中不可多得的女子。伊的心裏很願得天下名士而事之，寫書與侯公子。所以侯公子今日托在下便道趨前執柯，不知吾公亦以爲柳如是其人可取嗎？」陳臥子一聽這話，對美少年臉上相視了一下，又察成美少年腰肢婀娜，絕類閨人，心中有幾分明白。暗想落花有意，流水無情，我已耽禪悅，遠避情魔，豈可自墮綺陣，不得不辜負伊人一片心了。自己托黃毓祺導引錢牧齋到伊妝閣中去相見，本是有意欲成就他們姻緣，想小到伊人遼是睠睠於我，那慶我也不必說破，祗要嚴詞拒絕，灰了伊人的心，也就是間接促進錢柳二人的成功。所以他臉色一沉，毅然答道：「柳如是固是天下佳人，蒙侯公子一番雅意，代爲蹇修。但鄙人年來學佛心切，屛絕紛華，無意金屋藏嬌，祇得有負美意，尙乞代鄙人轉謝侯公子，並謝如是，勿再以鄙人爲念。一陳臥子末一句話說得甚是斬釘截鐵。美少年聽了，臉上頓時艷然變色，雙眉緊鎖，又說道：「吾公此話可眞嗎？」陳臥子道：「豈敢虛言唐突？我心已決，母煩贅詞。」說罷，雙目閉上，下逐客之令了。　（一五）</p>
<h3 id="c87">過年 <a href="#c87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>— 左蕙</p>
<p>大公司的玻璃橱裹佈置起雪景，禮品，賀年片之類，這是在向人報吿說：又是過年節的時候了。「過年又怎末呢？窮人會這樣說；有錢的可忙啦，送禮，宴客，白相……。這一羣人們，平時幾乎每天吃魚吃肉的在那裹過「小年」，現在，像客堂裏楊先生所說的：「陽曆年底了，我們耍過陽曆年啦！」</p>
<p>楊先生把這好消息通知他所有的朋友了，叫他們務須準時。楊先生寫了一張名單，估計一下，大的有四五桌。客堂，前樓，坐不了這許多人，所以亭子間也得暫借一用了。肴饌呢，楊師母也已決定妥當，她說：「小菜自己做麻煩，還是爽爽快快的叫幾桌。「節省」一些，四十元的吧！』</p>
<p>楊師母最會出主意，一個備婦新近因聽不了她太多的自相矛盾的主意以致吿退了；所以她說小菜還是叫幾桌便當，其實呀，她自己根本做不來菜</p>
<p>又來了一僩客人。第一要事，楊先生拍了幾記掌說：「老×別人我們都通知過了，可忘了你啦。對你說，我們要通年了呢！』</p>
<p>『這末早？』客人說。</p>
<p>『不早呀，』楊先生飛一飛眉的說：「我們過的陽暦年呀」</p>
<p>「陽曆年，這倒是新發明。」客人嘻笑着：「楊先生，別這樣忙，陽曆年過了後陰暦年還過不呀？否則——』</p>
<p>「陽暦年管陽暦年，這的確是我的新發明；不過，你放心，陰曆年還是一樣過的。」楊先生就是這一股高興，大的他的合股的米店賺得太多了，他的那爿公司裏起碼又有幾千的花紅，年底到，只要等着拿，那不多快樂快樂，多請請客還怎的呢！末了，楊先生父附上一句說：「這次小來來，「節省」一些，下决重來過。」</p>
<p>「那末好了我的嘴！贊格。」客人笑開了口……</p>
<p>一次，二次，楊先生的二個孩子常常跑來抱住我的大腿呼叫着：「我們要過年了，」</p>
<p>「過年」，聽見這個名字，我禁不住從心裹發出來一聲苦笑：上海的闊人到底聰明，別地的同胞決想不出這些來的吧</p>
<h3 id="c88">從「×祖宗說起」 <a href="#c88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>

<p>雖然「窮小子」並不想吃什麽買什麽，可是有了報就總得細看一遍；固然不致於報眉日期翻到「召租」「遺失」，廣吿却是跳不過我的眼光的。</p>
<p>今天，就一眼看到了挺「新奇」的調味品「×祖宗」。</p>
<p>廣吿上說：「內有十元五元鈔票；十磅五磅白米　」還有：「一元·五角·一角·五分鈔票交交關……」等等。看過之後，不禁歡喜得「雀躍三丈」　鈔票，白米，誰不想？誰不要？</p>
<p>後來仔細一想：這「祖宗」却並不是一枝檀香二串長錠就可以請」回來的；它也要用錢去買，沒有錢休想！</p>
<p>因此，就連帶想到了充塞於報端的補品」「大衣」「西餐」之類的廣吿。</p>
<p>話並不錯：身體弱了進補；身上冷了穿衣；肚子餓了吃東西！</p>
<p>不過：今年凍不凍死還成問題，　論「補品」？能够有一件破棉襖已經是「南無阿彌陀佛」了，豈敢奢望大衣」？冷粥一盅，大餅一塊，「勝造七級浮屠」，吃「西餐」可「折殺我也！</p>
<p>其實平心一推敲，倒明白了用不着我來「窮兇極惡」地喊不平；廣吿自有其對象，本來又不是登給窮小子看的！</p>
<p>那眞是「神經過敏」了。</p>

<p>— 秋雨</p>
<p>劇藝社拍電慰唁熊輝女士　周劍雲于伶負責追悼事宜</p>
<p>靑年戲劇家沈西苓先生在渝因病逝世的消息傳到上海來後，不論識與不識，都是感到萬分惋惜的！</p>
<p>他，沈西苓先生，有着溫和靜默的性情，刻苦研究的精神，當他在日本留學回來　後，就担仟了天一影業公司的裝置工作；因爲他的學識修養豐富，不久，他便是一個電影的編劇導演工作者了。他的第一部編導作品是「女性的吶喊」（王瑩主演）。他的成功作是「十字街頭」（趙丹等主演），和「上海二十四小時」。</p>
<p>他，沈西苓先生，眞是一位多才多藝的靑年，不但，在電影上有那樣高的造就，就是在舞臺界也有很大的供獻，他導演的「武則天」，滿座一月多，幾平是震驚了劇壇，他和宋之的合導的「醉生夢死」，也給人以不能磨滅的印象。</p>
<p>「八一三」之後，他勇敢地離開了上海，投向祖國的懷抱。在重慶，他和女藝人熊輝結合了。他得到了精神的安慰者，就更全力的去應付時代的重任。在中國製片中，他是最努力的一員。</p>
<p>誰會想到像這樣刻苦的藝人，竟是這樣早的離我們而去呢？</p>
<p>留在上海的劇藝工作者，沒有一個不聽到這惡耗而感到惋惜的。上海劇藝社同人已拍電去慰唁沈夫人熊輝女士。而電影界也許要將他生前的作品重映一下，以誌紀念！</p>
<p>我們追悼沈西苓先生之餘，是不能忘記他　苦的精神，來繼承他未竟的工作！</p>
<p>（按，沈西苓噩耗傳來，議與不識，同聲哀悼，關於追悼事宜已由留　友好周劍雲于伶等發起籌備，暫定三種辦法。（一）各報副刊，發行紀念特輯。（二）搜羅沈氏遺作劇本，舉行紀念公演。（三）以沈氏最後之電影作品「十字街頭」。接洽戲院公映。惟日昨一度討論後，第三項辦法略有問題，蓋「十字街頭」影片，目下恐無現成拷貝，如欲重新翻印一部，目下市價勢非兩千餘元不可，關於此事，已在開始籌備中。）</p>

<p>最近，電影界話劇界音樂界的同人聯合動員了許多人才，再度上演歌唱劇「上海之歌」。「上海之歌」是一個四幕歌唱劇，其中的歌曲，成爲無綫電播音中最受人歡迎的節目，這原因很簡單，因爲「上海之歌」中每一支歌，都是非常動聽的，作曲者張昊君曾費半年以上的心血，爲「上海之歌」而工作。</p>
<p>這决，最偉大的收獲，便是音樂界的總動員。向來一般有識之士批評中國音樂的不求上進，汗牛充楝，最大的廠結，厥爲音樂的人才藏在他們自己的圈子中，不肯爲大衆而工作；他們祇知道自己硏究高深的音樂，而忽略了大多數的人與他們距離更遠，這决學音樂的靑年男女，都自動參加「上海之歌」的演出工作，「上海之歌」中的合唱隊，由上海最著名的廣東聖樂園帮忙。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Gruen Rebuts Matsuoka's Speech: US Determined to Uphold Obligations and Rights; Actions, Not Eloquent Words, Move People; American People in China Sympathize with China <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo – US Ambassador to Japan, Mr. Gruen, recently delivered a speech warning Japan that the United States pays attention to actual actions, not empty words of peace. Before the US Ambassador's speech, Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka spoke, emphasizing that the alliance of Germany, Italy, and Japan was by no means a weapon against the United States. Matsuoka also acknowledged that US-Japan relations were slightly strained, but said that patience and strategy might allow the two countries to overcome this difficulty. Matsuoka also emphasized that Nomura was not a career diplomat, but a man of great talent, and that the American people would recognize this new ambassador to the United States as a truly sincere Japanese and a turning point for restoring international trust. We must restore international mutual trust, which is what the world needs most at this time. Japan's dispatch of Nomura to the United States is enough to show the Japanese government's aspirations for US-Japan relations. Matsuoka then acknowledged that US-Japan relations were currently very bad, and the basic reason for this deterioration was the American misunderstanding of Japan's goals and intentions. After Matsuoka finished speaking, US Ambassador Gruen took the floor and first expressed his gratitude for Matsuoka's "forthright speech," stating that the US and Japan were in complete agreement on several key points, namely, that both the US and Japan hoped for peace, hoped to be calm arbiters, and hoped that Admiral Nomura's mission would improve US-Japan relations. However, there were still several points that had become points of contention between the US and Japan. I do not wish to bring them up specifically, but I think it is necessary to clearly tell the Japanese Foreign Minister that most of the American people in China sympathize with China. Gruen then issued a warning, saying that Japan's actions spoke louder than its words, and the United States would judge based on Japan's actions. The US Ambassador refuted many of the statements made by Matsuoka, and specifically pointed out that Matsuoka's statement that China's fate was a matter of sympathy for Americans, while for the Japanese it was an important issue concerning the survival of the Japanese Empire, was erroneous. Gruen continued, "I also note the Japanese Foreign Minister's statement that Japan's plans do not close doors to any country anywhere, and that Japan will never engage in conquest or aggression." Matsuoka has lived in the United States for a long time and must know the fact that Americans are peace-loving at heart, must deeply know that Americans have a strong determination regarding the issue of their rights and obligations, and also deeply know that Americans only recognize actual actions and facts, regardless of what kind of decoration is used to adorn the appearance of these facts. (United Press, 19th)</p>
<p>Tokyo – The newly appointed Japanese Ambassador to the United States, Admiral Nomura, will travel to the puppet state of "Manchukuo" before going to the United States to take up his post. Today, the Japan Association held a banquet at the Imperial Hotel to see him off. US Ambassador to Japan, Gruen, was present. Gruen gave a welcoming speech, saying that Mr. Matsuoka's knowledge of the United States was very detailed. I dare to believe that Mr. Matsuoka, because of his close ties in the United States, must have personal feelings for our country, just as I do for Japan. When this kind of personal feeling exists, it can often exert its influence, even reaching international affairs. Mr. Matsuoka and I have talked to each other very sincerely and frankly, sometimes in writing, sometimes not. Because I believe that there is no need for old-fashioned courtesy between us, and I avoid using diplomatic tactics. Therefore, we both know each other's position very well on the cases that occur, and we agree or disagree on these cases, all based on a sincere and objective position. This kind of mutual freedom, applied to any discussion, can benefit both sides. In this turbulent international situation and the gloomy and chaotic autumn of the world, there are many events that need to be handled. The Foreign Minister has taken the time to attend today and address his colleagues, and this association is truly grateful.</p>
<p>Reports of Soviet Purchases of Military Supplies from the US</p>
<p>Washington – It was reported here yesterday that the Soviet Union has entered the US market and is making large purchases of important military supplies, especially copper and cotton. It is reported that the Soviet Union intends to resell these military supplies to Germany. The US Department of Agriculture and Commerce revealed that although the Soviet Union did not purchase US cotton in 1938 and 1939, nor did it purchase any in the first two months of this year's shipbuilding season, it did purchase 54,000 bales of US cotton in October, and 23,000 bales in the first 21 days of November. At the same time, the number of copper purchased by the Soviet Union is not yet clear, but reporters expect that when the news is announced, a large shipment will be seen to have arrived in the Soviet Union. (International News Agency, 19th)</p>
<p>Matsuoka's Speech</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Matsuoka then stood up and said that he was honored to be able to gather with friends who were dedicated to enhancing the understanding between Japan and the United States. Admiral Nomura's appointment to the United States has been through some twists and turns. I would like to tell you all that he initially resolutely declined, but after three months of entreaties and attacks, this strong-willed admiral finally succumbed. Our country's newspapers refer to Admiral Nomura as a "cannon." You should know that he is physically and mentally worthy of the name "cannon." I dare to say that if any conflict arises in the Pacific, he can certainly be a powerful cannon with a blade, and can shatter all the possibilities and potential of this conflict. But I must tell you that in the new order of our plans, there is no conquest, no oppression, no selfish exploitation. If Japan does such unjust things in the future, we will do our best to oppose them. No matter what kind of pressure is put on us, no matter who slanders us, we will not be led astray from our established course. Japan is truly a model of ideals. This model of ideals, transmitted from ancient times since the establishment of the empire to this day, aims to enable each country to occupy a considerable position in the world. In my view, our world seems to be too broad in politics and too narrow in economics. Economic activities that should spread throughout the world should not be subject to restrictive damage. As for our political power, it should be limited to the scope that is most important to us, and should not extend to the borders of other people. If regional peace can be ensured through regional understanding, then the whole world can enjoy universal peace. I have always held this ideal. For example, the recent Havana Conference attempted to protect the peace and order of the Western Hemisphere through regional cooperation. Matsuoka then said to Nomura, "You should know that every inch of this six-foot body is a true Japanese, but at the same time it is a tool of international trust and trustworthiness." We must restore trust in all countries, which is what the world urgently needs at this time. I believe that Admiral Nomura will be able to continue Mr. Horiuchi's work and perform his duties happily. Mr. Horiuchi, with the help of his kind-faced wife, has won the hearts of the Americans. I now take this opportunity to express my deep gratitude to Mr. Horiuchi and his wife for their continuous efforts to promote friendship between the United States and Japan. The fundamental reason for the various tensions between the United States and Japan lies in the American misunderstanding of Japan's goals and aspirations. The United States and other places believe that Japan is currently engaged in an imperialistic and insatiable war of aggression against China. In fact, Japan is not like that. This is not a war of aggression, nor is it a greedy ambition. What we are engaged in now is a kind of moral crusade. We are now trying to establish justice, fairness, and mutual benefit, and start a new era of lasting peace and unlimited prosperity in Greater East Asia. We firmly believe that Japan has the mission of civilization and stability in Greater East Asia. A part of the American people, whether intentionally or unintentionally, misunderstands Japan's plans and accuses Japan of harboring hostility towards the United States. Nothing could be more unfounded or inaccurate than this. In fact, Japan never wants to be hostile to the United States, nor does it want to be hostile to any country. What we want is to maintain and even increase our friendship with all countries. On the one hand, we only want to be left alone so that we can carry out construction projects without interference. On the other hand, we want to see the end of the disputes in China and the wars in Europe as soon as possible, and that no other country will participate. Allowing it to be a powerful United States, now try to imagine, what would be the situation if the United States participated in the European War or had a conflict with Japan in the Pacific? If any of you present here have any human feelings or conscience, how can you not be horrified when you think about it?</p>
<p>Loyalty to the Axis</p>
<p>Regarding this point, I would like to make sure that no citizen of the United States harbors any doubts in their mind, that is, Japan will continue to be loyal to its allies in the Axis powers. Japan's future diplomatic policy will be based on the Tripartite Pact as its axis, just as the Anglo-Japanese Alliance was effective in the past. This statement does not contain any threats. It is a simple statement of honesty, issued to prevent any possible misunderstandings from occurring. Because if there are illusions about such events, it will be harmful and not beneficial to everyone. In short, the fate of China, in the eyes of Americans, is mostly an emotional event, while in the eyes of Japanese, it is truly a matter of utmost importance, because it concerns the survival of the Japanese Empire. We are confident, not hopeless, about the prospect of China restoring peace as soon as possible. When peace is restored in the future, the difficult situation that currently exists between the United States and Japan will naturally diminish. Regarding this point, the newly established regime in Nanjing can be seen as a precursor to a turning point. As Admiral Nomura departs, I wish him a pleasant period of successfully completing his mission of promoting mutual trust between Japan and the United States. The waves of the Pacific may rise high, but we hope that Admiral Nomura, with his ambition and courage, will guide us to the other shore, like a skilled sailor. We should know that although we only see a small sail swaying in the angry sea, this boat does not lose its balance because of its load. This load is what our eyes cannot see, that is, the spirit of the people of both countries to maintain their composure, judgment, and self-control, and the common sense to deal with the unprecedentedly terrifying world situation. We should keep our heads clear. We should not act rashly. We must plan before we act, because there is still plenty of room for maneuvering, so why rush? We should all be calm and not impatient. This is what I hope for.</p>
<p>Gruen's Speech</p>
<p>After Matsuoka finished speaking, US Ambassador Gruen, because of two points in his speech, namely, that Japan will always be loyal to its Axis allies and that American interests in China are mostly a matter of emotion, stood up again to speak, earnestly denying that American interests in China are mostly a matter of emotion, and said that he also agreed with Matsuoka's view of wanting calm judgment, but that what is truly valuable are facts and actions. As for the moving words that conceal actions, they are not worth paying attention to. Japan is loyal to the Axis, while the American people are determined to uphold their obligations and rights. Nomura also made a brief speech, stating his desire to promote friendship and maintain peace in the Pacific between the two countries that have no reason to argue. (Reuters, 19th)</p>

<p>To put it calmly, we cannot talk about a sharp turn or a twist at the moment; because as far as the so-called world situation has reached this stage, has it really reached its peak in terms of becoming bigger and worse? In many ways, there are countless possibilities for it to become bigger and worse; if it continues to become bigger and worse, then in fact it is still far away from its peak; and the various aspects that have been alerted, prepared, planned, and even discussed in recent times are all about dealing with the bigger and worse, even its peak. However, the thinking of observing events and changes should not be walking a straight line with one's eyes closed. Just like Germany's eastern and western attacks, its momentum is like a broken bamboo, and it wins every battle. After it defeated France, which was known as the strongest in the world, it took advantage of the victory to attack Britain; but now it has at least proved that the blitzkrieg strategy cannot defeat Britain, and it has also proved that Britain's military strength has turned stronger and the situation has turned better, just like Italy's shock in Southern Europe, its ambition to swallow the Mediterranean Sea, cross the desert, break the British army, and drive straight into Egypt; it regarded Greece as withered wood, and boasted that it would be enough to finish it in three weeks; but now Greece is counterattacking and penetrating deep into Albania, and Britain is counterattacking and repeatedly breaking Libyan fortresses, killing and capturing tens of thousands. Germany's attack on Britain and Italy's entry into Egypt to attack Greece, how can we know that they are not the golden age of Germany and Italy's great victory and great benefit, and claiming to be the hegemon; from then on, it may not only be impossible to add to it, but also impossible to continue it. Looking back on the past afterwards, it is very possible that the power of Germany and Italy at that time was the actual peak. In short, it is still difficult to say whether the current stage of the world situation has not reached its peak or has passed its peak, that is, it is not allowed to make a conclusion hastily. This is what should be distinguished and recognized before delving into today's news.</p>
<p>The so-called sensational news of today. According to a Washington dispatch from the American International News Agency, it roughly says:</p>
<p>"Yesterday, officials here announced that the United States will urgently order its ambassadors to Italy and France to take up their posts immediately after their leave is over. It is revealed that Ambassador to Italy, Mr. Phillips, will return to Rome; Admiral Leahy will take up the post of new ambassador to France. It is believed that the US government may prepare to confer with the heads of state of Italy and France, and provide assistance to them, and may even put pressure on them to prevent the two countries from being over-controlled by Germany. Observers here point out that Italy and France are now in urgent need of food and other supplies. The US government may provide this food to Italy and France, and transport the supplies across the Atlantic. This declaration by the US government has caused a stir in diplomatic circles, which believe that since people in Rome feel disappointed due to military setbacks and the budding economic crisis, they would be happy to accept a cessation of hostilities. News from Turkey says that since Italy has a gradually tendency towards peace, a truce between Britain and Italy is "very possible". Diplomatic circles are studying this news together with the US government's declaration. Since France surrendered, the US ambassador to France has been vacant until now. The US government has sent Admiral Leahy to take up this post, and the relationship between the United States and the Vichy government will be further improved. It is generally believed that Laval is a tool in the hands of the Nazis. The recent reorganization of the French government seems to be Marshal Pétain using his power to subdue Laval, thus the US and French governments have aroused great trust."</p>
<p>In this telegram, there are few facts narrated and many opinions introduced: all that is said is possible, not inevitable. If the current "possibility" actually becomes "reality" in the future, then the world situation has in fact passed its peak; although there is no hope for a sharp turn for the better, it is an extremely important transformation; although it cannot be avoided from twists and turns, it is a sign that it is hopeful to be recovered. However, these are only assumptions at present.</p>
<p>Assuming that these have indeed become problems. As far as the problematic France and Italy are concerned, the angle of activity related to Italy is large, and the angle of activity related to France is small. The dismissal of Laval by the Vichy Head of State, Marshal Pétain, proves that Pétain is not entirely a German puppet and is at the mercy of others. Nor is it Laval's personal tool and is manipulated by him. Therefore, Britain, the United States, and other parties suddenly felt a good impression. The wars in Greece and North Africa have indeed had a profound impact on the overall world situation, and they must have a subtle effect on Pétain's psychology; therefore, Britain, the United States, and other parties have triggered expectations at close range. These impressions and expectations are not illusory. We should not regard this as the traditional optimism of Britain and the United States and regard it as laughable; however, as the general trend shows, if Germany has not encountered serious new difficulties and Italy itself has admitted its decisive failure, then no matter what Pétain's ambitions are, the role that Pétain is currently playing in fact cannot escape being a German puppet and a tool of the pro-German faction. That is, no matter what Pétain's psychology is now and in the future, what he thinks of Britain, what he thinks of the United States, no matter how the United States can help France, and who it sends to be stationed in France, Vichy still cannot avoid German pressure, let alone get rid of German control and help the transformation of the world situation. On the contrary, the more unfavorable the overall situation is to Germany and the more favorable it is to Britain, the more likely it is that Germany will tighten its grip on France, making Vichy a complete puppet and a complete tool, unable to move. How should the so-called France and the so-called Vichy be distinguished and recognized between the two? That is another question, but there is no doubt that the Vichy regime cannot exist without being pro-German at present. Therefore, although the United States has now regarded France as a problem that can be solved, the angle of activity it has obtained must not be very large.</p>
<p>As for Italy, because its encounter has become a big problem for itself, it has also become a big problem for the future of the world situation. The extremely serious military setbacks mentioned in the above-mentioned telegram from the International News Agency, problem one; the budding economic crisis, problem two; the domestic attitude of tending towards peace, problem three: in addition, as Hungary and Yugoslavia are close to Italy, there have been frequent reports in recent days that Germany has secretly sent more than 50,000 troops to enter Italy one after another, problem four. The first problem is obvious. The second problem is that Italy was originally not self-sufficient and was absolutely dependent on the Mediterranean Sea, which was slightly blockaded and was able to receive supplies smoothly. The third problem is that the Italian national character loves peace, but now it is engaged in expanding bloodshed, and it was launched under fascist rule rather than democratic rule. The troops have been unfavorable and have not won a single victory. The fact that these three points have become problems is truly undeniable; what is unknowable is to what extent the impact has already become serious? If each battle situation can be turned into an advantage, then there is still hope to reverse the situation, but at present, even if it is not very serious, it will inevitably become more and more serious and eventually become extremely serious; and we cannot regard the "a truce between Britain and Italy is very possible" mentioned in the previous telegram as a sign of the traditional optimism of Britain and the United States. As for the fourth point, the problem of German troops entering Italy, we are still waiting for a follow-up report, but the seriousness of the problem is not in whether it is accurate or not; in other words, if it is accurate, it is a serious problem, and if it is not accurate, it is also a serious problem. If it is accurate, then considering the natural nature of Mr. Hitler, analyzing the basic spirit of Nazi imperialism, and based on the general principle of claiming to be the hegemon, and there can be only one sun in the sky, the consequences of German troops arriving in Italy, no matter how clearly they are touted or how secretly they are promised, will inevitably be a big problem. If it is not accurate, then although the Greek army is only as lively as a dragon and tiger in Albania, and the British army is only as turbulent as the wind and angry tide in Libya, they have not yet stepped into the Italian homeland; however, the news of several defeats, and the bad news of tens of thousands of deaths, disappearances, and captures, and the continuous return of wounded soldiers, these must have already entered the Italian border, and instilled into the ears and eyes of the Italians, and touched the hearts of the government and the public; how can it be done without strong aid? Even if the people are ignorant, Mussolini cannot fail to know; how can it be done without strong aid? Under such circumstances, if it is said that the allied Germany is indifferent and does not send a single soldier, wouldn't it be another big problem? The problems encountered by Italy are like this, so it cannot be managed by doing nothing and healed without medicine! How to cure it, or how it has promoted the greater and worse changes in the situation, must affect the entire changes in the world situation.</p>
<p>A sharp turn for the better is hopeless, and there are countless twists and turns. Please wait and see the inevitable trend.</p>
<h3 id="e3">Southern Anhui Huajiang Defense Troops Pose a Major Threat to the Japanese Army; Over 30 Japanese Ships and Boats Bombed and Destroyed in Recent Months; Japanese Troops in the Dongliu Xiangkou Area Have Suffered a Complete Retreat <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Somewhere in Southern Anhui – The Huajiang Defense Garrison has achieved remarkable results in blocking Japanese shipping. With continuous artillery bombardment by mobile artillery, more than 30 Japanese ships and boats have been damaged by Chinese water mines in recent months. Japanese shipping has been seriously threatened and seems to be carrying out a planned attack-and-retreat war against China, attempting to prevent the Chinese army from advancing and sending troops along the coast to maintain the safety of its shipping. In mid-November, they gathered three to four thousand people in the Dongliu Xiangkou area. From the 21st, under the cover of Japanese aircraft, they launched disturbances from Dongliu and other places in separate directions. The Chinese army blocked them at every turn, and the battle was fierce. Subsequently, another unit of the Chinese army reinforced them and launched a fierce pincer attack on the Japanese army. The Japanese suffered heavy casualties and the remnants were unable to support themselves and suffered a complete retreat on the evening of the 24th. The Chinese army took advantage of the victory and advanced, capturing even more. By the time the remaining Japanese troops had completely retreated to Dongliu and Xiangkou, the original positions were restored. Japanese supplies were scattered all over the ground. In this battle, more than 1,500 Japanese soldiers were killed or wounded, and many spoils of war and important documents were seized. After the disastrous defeat, the Japanese army once again gathered the remnants, attempting to try again. On the evening of the 27th, more than 1,000 Japanese troops were added to Madang from the lower reaches of the Yangtze River. On the afternoon of the 28th, more than 1,000 Japanese troops were transferred from Dongtang to Xiangkou, intending to make trouble. The Chinese army was waiting in strict formation. As expected, more than 1,000 Japanese troops launched an attack on the morning of the 1st towards the area north of Juhejiatan (south of Xiangkou), and Madangkou (Pengze), and engaged in fierce fighting for several hours. The Japanese army repeatedly charged back and forth near Malukou, but all failed. On the morning of the 2nd, the number of Japanese troops at the intersection was increased to more than 1,600. Under the cover of Japanese aircraft, they launched a fierce attack on (south of Pengze). The Chinese army fought bravely to meet them, and the fierce fighting lasted for a wide day. The Japanese suffered quite a few casualties. On the morning of the 3rd, the Chinese army, together with fresh troops, launched attacks in separate directions. The Japanese army collapsed to the north. On the afternoon of that day, more than 200 Japanese troops were completely annihilated by the Chinese army, and three Japanese officers were killed. In addition, the Japanese army in the Feituling area was chased and killed by the Chinese army again until they retreated to the high ground south of Malukou and built fortifications to defend themselves.

<p>Japanese Offensive Suffers Setback</p>
<p>A reporter in Chongqing recently met a military expert and inquired about the outline of the recent battles in various theaters and the movements of the Japanese army. He said that since the Japanese army suffered a disastrous defeat in that mid-winter offensive, it had retreated to its original positions and could not move. The invasion of China has repeatedly suffered setbacks, and the southward advance is also impossible. The officers and soldiers are tired of war and their morale is depressed. The outline of the battles in various places is very simple. In Central China, the Chinese armies took advantage of the victory and attacked the Japanese army, all of which were victorious. In South China, the Japanese army remained dormant as before, at a loss. In North China, such as the Pu-Xin Line and the Bai-Jin Highway, they were like a seesaw with each other, but they were all small-scale battles for control. Looking back, the morale of the Chinese army is high and they are eager to try. After four years of resistance, their determination has not diminished. From top to bottom, they are of one mind and believe in the revolutionary tactics instructed by our Supreme Commander, and they have a belief that they will win, which is truly beyond the expectations of the Japanese.

<h3 id="e5">The Su Newspaper Reports on the Chinese Army's Counteroffensive Achieving Major Results; The War in Central China is Extremely Fierce; Yichang and Vicinity Gain the Initiative <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>Moscow – The Labor Newspaper published a special article today, along with a detailed map, commenting on the situation in the Chinese war zone up to the 17th. It pointed out that the most active warfare in recent months has been in Central China, where the Chinese army, with the help of guerrillas destroying the Japanese army's rear, has launched a major counteroffensive. The fighting is extremely fierce, and the Yangtze River line occupies an important position in the war results. Therefore, both sides are engaged in fierce competition there. The author highly praised the bravery of the Chinese army in combat. The artillery on the Yangtze River and the troops ambushing in the countryside have all achieved important results, posing a major threat to Japanese military operations and transport ships. The Japanese army's offensive attempts in that area have been defeated. In other battlefields, the Chinese army's response to the Japanese offensive is to strengthen the counteroffensive forces. The Chinese army in the Yichang area has also gained the initiative on all fronts. After the Japanese army's recent offensive in North China failed, the Chinese high command has been trying to intercept the Japanese transportation lines, which has now achieved significant results. The author also devoted considerable space to narrating the victories of the Chinese army in Guangdong Province and Hainan Island. Finally, the newspaper said that the Sino-Japanese War has lasted for 41 months, but in the past two years, the Chinese army's front line has entered a state of consolidation. (18th dispatch)</p>

<p>Hanoi – The French attitude towards the war on the Vietnamese-Thai border is gradually becoming tougher today. French artillery fired 24 rounds from Savannakhet in French territory on the Mekong River towards the Thai village of Mok this morning. News last night stated that Vietnamese rebel natives murdered the warden of the Paul-Bert lighthouse on Sunday and kidnapped his wife and young son.

As for what the kidnappers are demanding, whether it is an exchange of hostages or something else, is unknown. (19th dispatch, United Press)</p>
<p>Bangkok – Yesterday, Thai aircraft bombed seven areas in northern Vietnam. The air war between Thailand and Vietnam has therefore become more tense. Radio Bangkok said that three important towns in Cambodia were also bombed by Thai aircraft, losing their original condition. The radio station also repeatedly stated Thailand's declaration of the start of "retaliatory bombing." It is said that the Thai government is extremely willing to negotiate peacefully with France, but France is repeatedly carrying out "provocative bombing," which has led to a worsening of relations between the two countries. The Thai government commented on the statement by the Vietnamese Governor-General Decoux that all Thai aggressive actions will be severely retaliated against, saying that French bombing and threats cannot deter the Thai people. Yesterday's largest air raid by Thailand since the worsening of Thai-Vietnamese relations was Thailand's response to the French air raid.

<p>French Newspaper Commentary – Self-Defense Policy</p>
<p>Lyon – The repeated disputes between Thailand and French Vietnam have recently been commented on by Le Temps, which stated that any attempt that harms the territorial integrity of French territories and its legitimate sovereignty will definitely be defended with all our strength. The forceful retaliatory measures taken by the French Air Force against certain acts of violence by Thailand are clear evidence of this. This move has also had a significant impact in Thailand's public opinion circles. If the Thai government is swayed by the extremist forces that advocate "Pan-Thaiism," it will definitely make a big mistake. In short, the policy implemented by the Pétain government is aimed at maintaining the territorial integrity of Vietnam and preserving the unity of all French territories. The resolute attitude adopted by the Vietnamese authorities is in line with this policy. (18th dispatch, Havas)</p>

<p>Cairo – It was learned here yesterday that on Tuesday, the Central Army attacked El Wak, a fortress on the border of Italian Somaliland, and the Italian commander guarding the area fled far away on a mule cart as soon as he heard the news of the British attack. Although the Italian army resisted slightly, their combat effectiveness was poor. It is said that the African troops were more willing to engage in combat than the Italian troops. Seeing this situation, one of the Italian troops was greatly discouraged and automatically informed the British army of the location of the stored ammunition after the fortress fell. In this battle, one Italian lieutenant colonel was captured, and a large number of African native soldiers were also captured. The British army also seized several cannons, countless ammunition, and a large number of gasoline and military supplies. Important documents from the Italian headquarters also fell into the hands of the British army. The British army initially advanced rapidly through the Egyptian desert, directly attacking El Wak. Armored vehicles led the way, followed by infantry. They first shelled and destroyed several buildings there before capturing it. (19th dispatch, Reuters)</p>
<p>Cairo – News was received here that this morning, the British mechanized forces in Africa broke through the strong defenses around Bardia, a key port in Libya. The remaining Italian troops are retreating westward from the area to Tobruk and Derna. It is reported that British warships and aircraft are constantly bombing the center of Bardia, and the greatly strengthened British armored columns have surrounded the city and broken through its defenses at several points. Therefore, the fall of the city is imminent. The Italian army is trapped by sea and air attacks and is reportedly retreating on a large scale from the Bardia area. It is also reported that they have broken through the semi-circular line composed of small fortresses, machine gun nests, tank formations, etc. with rapid action, and are fighting within the inner perimeter of Bardia. Therefore, thousands of Italian troops are likely to be unable to escape the encirclement westward. (19th dispatch, International News Service)</p>
<p>British Air Force Attacks in the Rain; Fierce Battles on the Entire Bardia Front</p>
<p>Cairo – Royal Air Force intelligence stated that Royal Air Force aircraft attacked Bardia in the western desert day and night yesterday despite heavy rain. The bombs dropped by the British aircraft in the Libyan border town ignited three fires in Italian army barracks and damaged a large number of transport vehicles. According to the report, reconnaissance flights indicated that the enemy was retreating towards Derna (a coastal town in Libya). Our fighter planes strafed the retreating enemy forces between Bardia and Tobruk with machine guns. British infantry and mechanized forces recently broke through several strongholds in the defensive area around Bardia. The entire front line is still in fierce battle. The British army is currently encountering strong resistance. There are conflicting reports from Bardia. It is reported that the Italian troops there have been heavily besieged but are still resisting stubbornly. According to a British military spokesperson, "It is quite difficult to capture."

<p>Cairo – During the offensive launched by the British army in the western desert last week, the British Air Force shot down or damaged 100 Italian aircraft, while the British aircraft losses were less than 10. This shows the severity of the British Air Force's attack on the Italian army in the western desert. British Air Force squadrons often brave torrential rain and poor visibility to continuously attack airfields in Libya and attack Italian troops and concentration points. A squadron of British eight-gun fighter planes attacked the area the previous day, strafing and destroying these Italian aircraft. The British eight-gun fighter planes were particularly active, attacking down the coast and flying low over the desert at up to 50 feet, severely attacking the advancing Italian army. Italian pilots have no fighting spirit when encountering this strong enemy. According to captured Italian pilots, British aircraft are equipped with eight guns, while Italian aircraft only have two guns and cannot resist. (19th dispatch, Reuters)</p>

<p>London – Although there is heavy snow on the Albanian front, news of Greek victories continues to arrive. According to a Greek military communiqué, the Greek army captured many Italian officers and soldiers and a large number of military supplies. According to unofficial sources, along the Adriatic coast, the Greek army has made progress towards Himara. Some Italian troops are still guarding Porto Palermo between Santi Quaranta and Himara. It is reported that the area is within range of Greek artillery fire. It is reported that the Greek army is approaching Tepelene, southeast of Vlora, and has occupied the high ground controlling Kleisoura. The Greek Prime Minister delivered a speech stating that the Greek army will continue to fight until the Italian army is driven out of Albania. Only when Italy is completely defeated can the war end.

<p>London – According to information received from responsible sources here, Hitler and the Nazis have repeatedly boasted that enemy aircraft cannot enter German airspace, but now seeing the success of British air raids, they are greatly alarmed. The German authorities are now trying to prevent the extent of the damage from being seen by the public. After each air raid, before the all-clear signal is given, they rush to remove rubble or cover up the destroyed traces to prevent people from seeing it. 850,000 children from Berlin, Hamburg, and the Ruhr have been evacuated to the southeast, and many private individuals have also sent away their children, so Vienna and other places are experiencing very crowded conditions for residents. It is reported that the Swedish air defense regulations are very strict. Residents must take shelter in air raid shelters upon hearing the alarm. Those injured indoors will not be compensated. The air raid shelters do not have heating, so Germans are reluctant to leave their bedrooms at night. According to what is heard here, the discomfort of life and the excessive strictness of the regulations have a greater impact on the German spirit than air raids. (19th dispatch, Reuters)</p>
<p>London – On Wednesday evening, the British Air Force attacked Mannheim, the most important industrial and commercial center in southwestern Germany, for the third night in a row.

After fierce fighting all day yesterday, the Greek army finally occupied an important mountain head, removing the last major obstacle to advancing into Kleisoura. The Italian army in Kleisoura is retreating and setting fire to various military supply depots.

<p>Washington, Yesterday, official sources here announced that the United States will urgently order its ambassadors to Italy and France to return to their posts immediately after their leaves expire. It is revealed that Ambassador Phillips will return to Rome, and former Governor of Puerto Rico, Admiral Leahy, will assume the position of the new ambassador to France. It is widely believed that the US government may be preparing to consult with the heads of state of Italy and France, provide them with assistance, and possibly exert pressure to prevent them from being excessively dominated by Germany. Observers here point out that Italy and France are now in urgent need of food and other supplies. The US government may be able to use this food supply to aid Italy and France, and is about to transport supplies across the Atlantic. This announcement by the US government has caused a stir in diplomatic circles, which believe that since people in Rome feel disappointed due to military setbacks and the burgeoning economic crisis, they would gladly accept a cessation of hostilities. A dispatch from Turkey claims that since Italy has shown a gradually inclining attitude towards peace, an armistice between Britain and Italy is "very possible." Diplomats are studying this news and the US government's declaration simultaneously. Since France's surrender, the US ambassador to France has been vacant. The US government is now sending Admiral Leahy to assume this position. At one point, it was widely believed that General Pershing was the most likely candidate for this position, but the former commander of the US Expeditionary Force in the last European war said that if he were offered this position, he would refuse it. It is believed that with Admiral Leahy's prestige and experience, his appointment to this position will further improve relations between the US and the Vichy government. It is generally believed here that Laval is a tool in the hands of the Nazis. The recent reorganization of the French government seems to be Marshal Pétain using his power to suppress Laval. Therefore, greater confidence has been generated between the French and US governments. (International News Agency dispatch, 19th)</p>
<p>Washington, US Secretary of State Hull announced here yesterday that US Ambassador to Italy Phillips will return to his post before Christmas. Phillips has recovered from his recent illness and is expected to go to Italy to take up his duties soon. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 19th)</p>
<p>Rome, News that the US ambassador to Italy is about to return to his post has not yet been received here last night. Officials believe that although this news is unexpected, it is not surprising. Ambassador Phillips left Rome due to illness after Italy entered the war. Therefore, Phillips' departure was purely personal in nature. Now that he has recovered and returned to his post, it is only natural. A month before Phillips left to return to his country, he conducted economic negotiations with Italy regarding its self-sufficiency policy and British blockade measures. It is only natural that negotiations made no progress after Phillips left his post. During Phillips' absence and after the US general election, Italy maintained a very reserved attitude. In short, there are no major diplomatic issues between the US and Italy that urgently need to be resolved. On the contrary, Phillips' return to his post will facilitate the normal diplomatic relations between the two countries. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 19th)</p>

<p>Vichy, German Special Envoy Abetz came here on the 16th of this month to hold talks with the French authorities. After 24 hours of active engagement, the discussions have concluded. Marshal Pétain hosted a banquet last night to entertain him. After the banquet, Abetz immediately returned to Paris, accompanied by General Roux, Marshal Pétain's aide-de-camp, to the border between the Free Zone and the Occupied Zone of France. (Havas dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>Diplomatic Maneuvering Moves to Paris</p>
<p>After meeting with French Chief Pétain, German Ambassador Abetz returned to Paris yesterday to report the details to the German Foreign Ministry. Subsequently, the focus of German-French affairs has shifted to Paris and Berlin. Laval, the former French Deputy Prime Minister who had been ousted, also went to Paris at 9:15 last night, following closely behind Abetz. Laval stated that this trip was only to take care of personal matters and would not involve any political activities. Regarding the cabinet reshuffle, outside observers feel that Marshal Pétain not only holds a nominal position, but also has great power to arbitrarily replace any minister, and that each minister must be directly responsible to him. There are widespread rumors abroad that the German ambassador came with a list of secret demands, or even presented the "Aix-la-Chapelle" method of governance. French officials dismissed these rumors as false, saying that the German ambassador's visit was only to ascertain whether the changes from Laval to Flandin would affect the cooperation agreements between Germany and France. As a result, the German ambassador left satisfied. Flandin is currently bedridden, and the "diplomatic illness" reported by foreign newspapers is clearly inaccurate. Before his departure, Laval stated that his political career had not come to an end, and that his downfall would not affect the agreements between Germany and France. He also stated that France's future still depends on close cooperation with the Axis powers to build a new European order. (United Press dispatch, 19th)</p>
<p>Laval Defends Himself, Denies Disloyalty</p>
<p>A Reuters diplomatic correspondent in London reports that the turmoil in Vichy does not seem to be subsiding. Laval, the former Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister, has regained his freedom under the protection of Dr. Ménétrel, but has not yet been reinstated. However, there are rumors that he may be stationed in Paris as the Vichy government's representative. The talks between Marshal Pétain and German Special Envoy Abetz two days ago lasted three hours. It is said that Abetz used persuasive methods rather than coercion during the talks, and tried his best to defend Laval, saying that he had never colluded with the Germans to plot against Pétain's safety or national interests. When Laval went to see Pétain from his place of confinement, he swore an oath, declaring that he had no disloyal intentions. Although Pétain seemed to agree not to punish him, he has not yet reappointed him to an important position. Under these circumstances, Flandin, who succeeded Laval as Foreign Minister, is clearly insignificant. If Abetz insists on Laval joining the cabinet, the cabinet situation will definitely be very tense, because both Laval and Flandin are ambitious and compete for power. If they are both in the cabinet, they will inevitably hurt each other. Therefore, Germany may not be willing to impose this dilemma on Vichy. As for Laval's proposal to allow German troops to pass through France to Italy, no reliable source has confirmed this. If Germany really wants to aid Italy, it can march through the Brenner Pass, and it does not need to pass through French territory. If Germany really wants to pass through French territory, German troops can enter French territory at any time, without waiting for French consent. However, the French navy and colonies will then rise up to resist Germany. Hitler knows that the French navy and colonies are far more important for German use than occupying French territory. The reason for Germany's current approach to dealing with Marshal Pétain lies in this. (Reuters dispatch, 19th)</p>

<p>Vichy, Before meeting with the German ambassador, Marshal Pétain first met with Admiral Darlan, the naval commander. This move is of great significance. The strength of the French navy is still very strong, and it has significant combat capabilities in the Atlantic and Mediterranean. Admiral Darlan still has great power in the French government, and opposes ceding the fleet to any other country. He also strongly supports Pétain. (United Press dispatch, 19th)</p>

<p>Germany Hopes for Close Cooperation Between the Two Countries</p>
<p>Political circles in Berlin foresee today, because a compromise to resolve the difficult situation has reached the point of Laval's dismissal, that cooperation between France and Germany in establishing a new European order will become closer. At the same time, official German sources in Vichy say that the French ambassador to Germany, de Brinon, has formally replaced General Laurent as the special commissioner for the occupied zone. This order was issued yesterday by the Vichy cabinet. De Brinon is a close friend of Laval, and his power has increased as a result. It is widely believed that this transfer by the French government is also part of the compromise. At the same time, according to general opinion, Marshal Pétain now wields even greater power over French domestic affairs than before. The reason he is able to do so is that France and the Axis powers are still in a period of armistice, and have not yet reached a permanent peace. (International News Agency dispatch, 19th)</p>

<p>London, There are widespread reports that more than 50,000 German troops are now concentrated in Turin, Naples, and Taranto. The news of the arrival of this large number of German troops in Italy has not been fully confirmed. However, there is no shortage of evidence of German military preparations. A week ago, the Swedish Aftonbladet published a dispatch from Berlin saying that Germany is now organizing a batch of colonial police, who will receive initial training in Berlin and then go to Rome for further training. A neutral traveler who recently came here from Italy said that before leaving Rome, he heard that a large number of German anti-aircraft gunners had arrived there, and that a large number of German troops had entered Italy under the guise of instructors or trainers. The Italian public is mostly unaware of this matter. However, Italian military officers who told him about this matter spoke with considerable indignation, saying that this was the beginning of Germany's attempt to reduce Italy to a vassal state. The traveler also said that the arrogant attitude of German officers further increased the Italians' hatred. In addition, it is heard that two well-known German economists hold important positions in the Italian economic conferences. (Reuters dispatch, 19th)</p>

<h3 id="e33">The Queen of England at the Front Line <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>Since Britain was subjected to the German Luftwaffe's blitzkrieg attacks, the normal wartime life has undergone drastic changes, just as the regular life of peacetime has been devastated by war. Men are conscripted into the army, houses are destroyed by bombs, and everyone can only stay at home in the evening, or sleep in the basement and air raid shelters. General family life has also changed greatly, and children have been evacuated to the countryside. Everyone, rich or poor, old or young, has been greatly affected by the war.</p>
<p>The King and Queen, like the common people, are accustomed to hearing the whistling sound of bombs flying, the crashing down of window glass, or the falling of plaster from the walls. They also feel the floor shaking. Buckingham Palace has been hit by at least eight bombs, or exploded nearby, not counting those that fell on the lawn of the palace grounds. The swimming pool in the palace has been destroyed, and the chapel has also been damaged. The windows of the King and Queen's private residence have been shattered, and many holes have been blasted in the courtyard. One bomb landed near the King and Queen's office, just a short distance away. The Queen knows the outcome of the bombing, just as her subjects know.</p>
<p>For the sake of the war, the Queen's daily life has naturally changed greatly. On the one hand, this is also gratifying for her, because during the war, all social gatherings and various ceremonies have come to a halt. There are no more court appearances, no more tours, and no more banquets. Under these circumstances, the Queen has always been the mother of the nation, but in reality, she does not enjoy it.</p>
<p>What she is most concerned about is the British people—how they live, how they fight the war. Therefore, although the Queen's responsibilities have increased greatly due to the war, she has more opportunities to be close to the people and more time to engage in the activities she enjoys. Every morning, she always plans everything in her study first. After meals, she makes at least one visit, sometimes as many as four or five, to inspect hospitals, first aid stations, canteens, shelters, or other places where women work.</p>
<p>Since London was bombed, the Queen's daily life has undergone a change. Every morning, the location of the latest bombing is reported to the palace first. Based on this report, the King and Queen choose the most heavily affected area to inspect and comfort. Therefore, the residents of the slum areas who have been bombed and are stunned, when they are looking for relics in the rubble overnight, often see the Queen gracefully arrive, crossing the broken walls and charred wood, smiling at them and expressing her condolences to everyone. On the morning of the day the German Luftwaffe launched its first blitzkrieg against England, the King and Queen drove straight to the East End, which had been heavily bombed by German aircraft. Wherever the royal carriage went, the people cheered again and again. This kind of tour of the disaster areas is of great benefit, because it can show the people that their King and Queen are standing on the front line with them?</p>
<p>Buckingham Palace under air raids is like other major institutions in London. Sound detectors and searchlights are installed on the roof, constantly sweeping and shining in the high sky. In the nearby guard areas, alarm bells are also installed. When an aircraft appears overhead, an alarm is sounded. This is different from ordinary reports. When this kind of emergency alarm is heard, the people in the palace, including the King and Queen, completely run into the bomb shelter, leaving only a team of air raid wardens on the ground guarding.</p>
<p>The equipment in the bomb shelter in the palace is similar to that built under ordinary houses, and it is not particularly safe. These air raid shelters are mostly converted from basements or storage rooms, with wooden frames erected and more sandbags piled up. They do not go deep underground. Such air raid shelters can be seen everywhere in the homes of wealthy families in London.</p>
<p>When the Queen goes out during the day, she does not change her itinerary even if she encounters an alarm on the way, as if she ignores the air raids, unless the aircraft is already soaring above, she will never first hide in the air raid shelter. It can be said that although the danger she may encounter is not more than that of ordinary Londoners, it can be encountered at any time. In the high sky above London, solitary aircraft often appear in the clouds. They all close the sound of their engines. No aircraft locator in the world, no matter how sophisticated, has a way to find their sound. These German aircraft often break through the clouds and descend straight down, dropping bombs or firing machine guns in the bustling city. Sometimes, an air raid alarm is not heard when these aircraft attack. But the Queen, like any Englishman, does not stop the work she is doing, regardless of how the aircraft above her head is threatening. She still carries out everything as if nothing has happened, resembling any lady in the British Isles. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e34">Finance: Foreign Exchange Buying Frenzy; Strong Demand for US Dollar Futures; Speculators Buy All Day Long <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market situation: HSBC's listed prices did not fluctuate. The black market for British and American exchange rates continued to tighten. People's hearts were generally uneasy. Speculators were buying all day long. Although some sellers emerged, supply and demand ultimately remained uneven. Before noon, the US dollar had shrunk to 5.75 yuan. The market later traded at 5.71875 yuan, and futures were very popular, with strong demand. Today, speculators and Japanese banks bought the most US dollars for January. The closing price was 3 shillings, 6.09375 pence for British gold and 5.71875 yuan for the US dollar, tighter than the previous day, British gold 0.0625, US dollar 0.09375. The US dollar closed at 5.6875 yuan. It is heard that a certain speculator bought 200,000 US dollars to cash out gold. Trading was extremely active, and the market was in a state of chaos.</p>
<p>The Market Gradually Tightens</p>
<p>At the beginning of the morning, London's large transactions, both near and far, were flat. New York's silver price was still flat. London's spot gold was fixed. Exchange rates for British to US, Shanghai, etc. did not change. The US to British did not move, to Shanghai was slightly 2.2 cents, to France there was no market. The central bank's listed exchange rates remained as before. Banks opened for spot sales in the morning, with British gold at 3 shillings 6.5625 pence and the US dollar at 5.8125 yuan, compared to the previous day's close, US was flat and British gold was softer by 0.015625. After the opening, Chinese banks first had an appetite, and speculators followed with aggressive buying. The market gradually tightened. Initially, British banks ceded to Chinese banks and speculators US dollars for the next month at 5.78125 yuan. HSBC's listed prices did not fluctuate. The silver equalization tax also did not increase or decrease. After this, speculators continued to be active, and the potential trend became more popular. It is estimated that Chinese banks sold US dollars for the next month to speculators at 5.75 yuan. At the same time, Japanese banks also came to the market to buy US dollars for the same month at 5.75 yuan. By noon, demand was still strong, and long-term needs were very high. The closing price was 3 shillings 6.40625 pence for spot British gold and 5.75 yuan for the US dollar.</p>
<p>Few Sellers in the Afternoon</p>
<p>The market was initially flat in the afternoon, and then speculators sold slightly. It is estimated that US dollars for the next month were trading open at 5.75 yuan. Soon, speculators turned around and bought again. The market tightened. US dollars for the same month were quoted at 5.71875 yuan by foreign banks. People's hearts were uneasy, and real customers were scarce. The market was buoyant at the close. As a result, British gold for spot and current month was 3 shillings 6.09375 pence, and the US dollar was 5.71875 yuan. British gold for the next month was 3 shillings 5.9375 pence, and the US dollar was 5.6875 yuan. Compared to the previous day, British gold was tighter by 0.0625 for spot and futures, and the US dollar was shrunk by 0.09375. After the US dollar closed, it tightened again to 5.6875 yuan.</p>

<h3 id="e35">Rumors Spread, Gold Rush Resurges, Off-Exchange Trading Reaches a High of 6110 Yuan <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the fish market and black market suddenly rose due to unfavorable rumors. The rising trend expanded and the price broke through the 6,000 yuan mark. It then surged to around 6,100 yuan. Although securities firms and banks (substituting for bill merchants buying 200,000 US dollars) emerged to reverse the trend, selling about 4,000 taels each, the exchange rate tightened. A certain gold shop, a small money shop, and two other banks continued to buy. The scattered buying caused the price, after a small rebound to 5,980 yuan after the morning opening, to resume its upward trend amid rumors in the afternoon, soaring to a high price of 6,100 yuan before the evening close, a huge increase of 130 yuan. After the close, it rose again to 6,110 yuan. The total transaction volume for the day was 12,300 taels. Due to market chaos, no one inquired about cash. The price was 35 yuan lower than the futures price. There was also no opening for swap transactions. Buyers offered 30 to 35 yuan to sellers. Jewelry gold rose by 10 yuan to 620 yuan. Customs gold, etc., were flat.</p>
<p>The Fish Market Jumps 130 Yuan</p>
<p>At the beginning of the morning, due to the upward sentiment outside the market in the afternoon of the previous day, there were more buyers than sellers at the opening. Banks first made a deal for 20 taels, reaching 6,000 yuan, an increase of 40 yuan compared to the previous afternoon's close. The trading floor was unusually excited, and the buying atmosphere raised the price by another 25 yuan. It is estimated that the banks made a total of 20 taels, at 6,025 yuan. Before long, due to the consistent selling from banks and securities firms, the price suffered a setback. It is estimated that the banks sold 20 taels to gold shops, entering the 6,000 yuan mark, at 5,980 yuan. However, the exchange rate was reported tight, and the price could not be lowered. Short sellers took advantage of the low price to buy, and long sellers took profits. After a period of maneuvering, the price reached a high of 6,060 yuan due to the exhaustive searching by the Yu tax bank. It is estimated that the securities firms entered the banks with 20 taels. After this, the buying trend was slightly killed due to the cession of some bills merchants. However, the upward trend remained firm. As a result, the banks made a deal for 20 taels, at 6,035 yuan as the noon closing price. The banks made a deal for 20 taels at the afternoon opening, at 6,055 yuan. Afterwards, it fell slightly due to selling by retail investors. It is estimated that the gold shops sold 20 taels to the banks, at 6,010 yuan. Finally, due to the tight exchange rate, gold shops and other long investors bought in large quantities, and the huge buying trend lifted the price to 6,100 yuan. It is estimated that the banks made a deal for 20 taels. The banks made a deal for 20 taels at the evening close, at 6,090 yuan, a huge increase of 130 yuan compared to the previous day. After the close, it rose again to 6,110 yuan, and finally to 6,105 yuan. The total fluctuation for the day was 120 yuan (excluding the after-hours market). The selling price of the spot gold of the cash shops was 15 yuan lower than the futures price and 50 yuan lower than the purchase price. The spot gold should be listed 50-60 yuan lower than the listed gold, but there were few openings.</p>
<h3 id="e36">Jewelry Gold Listed at 620 Yuan <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>The selling price of gold jewelry in jewelry stores rose by 5 yuan in the morning and another 5 yuan at 4 pm. It is estimated that the Dahang industry revised the listed price to 620 yuan. The new industry had similar prices to the previous ones, with a purchase price about 30 yuan lower.</p>
<h3 id="e37">The Price of US Dollar Notes Soars to $17.50 <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, in the foreign exchange market, the market price of silver dollars suddenly surged past the 6,000 yuan mark, causing British gold pounds and British pounds to rise by 3 yuan each. The British pound already exceeded the 140 yuan mark. The price of British gold notes remained stable. The speculation in US dollar notes was intense, reaching a high of $17.50 in the evening market, a sharp increase of 1.5 jiao from the previous day. This was due to renewed rumors that the new "Central Bank" was about to be established. There was also no lack of demand for Hong Kong notes, and market prices continued to rise. Canadian dollars and Philippine notes were also in demand, and market prices tended to rise. The supply and demand of Japanese gold notes were balanced, and market prices remained stable, remaining at $1.575 in the evening market. The supply of Korean notes was slightly stronger, and the evening market retreated to $1.32.</p>
<h3 id="e38">Securities: Government Bonds Reach New High Prices - Steel Stocks Rise Due to Capital Increase - <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>The gray market for government bonds was particularly good yesterday. Both Type A and Type B bonds reached 74 yuan, exceeding the highest price of 73.9 jiao on November 25. Type B also reached 8.05 yuan, equivalent to the previous highest price. After hovering and brewing for two or three weeks, new high prices were finally discovered. Although the bulls bear very heavy interest, they are still able to gain an advantage, which shows their strong financial strength. If this momentum continues, there may be hope for further progress. In yesterday's trading, the appetite of Sin孚 was still insufficient in the morning. Dechang, Hongda, and the companies at numbers 16 and 40 all had considerable demand. Shengda also turned to active trading. Defu exclusively favored 96, actively buying in, which must have been for other calculations. The price was raised to above 7 yuan, supplied by Hongda, Juxin, and Yuda. In the afternoon, Shengda, Lianyi, and Number 5 entered Type A bonds, immediately seeing a new high price of 74 yuan. Hongda entered E and exited C, and many retail investors bought Huai. Houda, Runli, Tongshun, and Shunchang all sold. As a result, Type A and Type B bonds were slightly higher, while the rest were slightly weak. The transaction volume was more than 2 million yuan. A brief table is listed below:</p>
<p>In stock trading, 100 shares of Sanyou Industrial were traded at a price of $2.35.</p>
<p>The public stock market continued the upward trend of the previous day, and the situation became more and more intense. The fluctuations throughout the day were quite large. This was probably due to the Steel Company announcing that it would issue a 50% dividend and issue new shares (10 yuan per share, one new share for each old share). This stock had the highest transaction volume, and the price was 10 yuan higher than the previous day. Jardine Matheson also once reached a high price of 93 yuan. Tsingtao Beer also had a large transaction volume, with a price of 7.2 jiao. All industrial stocks benefited and rose. The potential of rubber stocks was also strong, and prices increased slightly.</p>
<p>According to the Steel Co., Ltd., managed by Jardine Matheson, it has decided to continue raising 250,000 new shares. The subscription price per share is set at 10 yuan in national currency. The shareholder register on January 3 of next year will be used as the basis for old shareholders to subscribe for shares according to their holdings. Each old share can subscribe for one new share.</p>
<h3 id="e39">Cotton Yarn: Profit-Taking Emerges, Yarn Market Rises Sharply and Retraces Slightly, Actual Sales Can Be Said to Be Quiet <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>After the yarn market discovered a new peak, it turned back. This was because most profit-takers cashed out, resulting in a slight loosening of chips and a decline in market conditions. At the same time, actual transactions were greatly reduced, so most of the floating long positions tended to close out. However, as the foreign exchange contraction and gold prices rose, foreign customers still entered more and exited less. However, some people say that the price of 20-count assorted brand yarn is inevitably cheaper, and the difference from the Double Horse brand is too far. Today, 360 bales of cotton yarn were shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Double Horse opened in the morning. Because the bulls were very active in the afternoon of the previous day and were eagerly searching outside, it had risen to 1,348 yuan. This morning, there was a lot of discussion, saying that the gray market for gold had risen sharply, and everyone unanimously expected it to rise. The opening price was 1,352 yuan. As soon as this price opened, buyers gathered, and the shouting shook the outdoors, rising directly to 1,355 yuan. Unexpectedly, profit-taking bulls took the opportunity to massively sell off, causing the trading floor to loosen slightly. It fluctuated between 1,350 yuan and 1,354 yuan several times. However, the gold gang, due to the weakening of foreign exchange, was dragging fiercely. Finally, due to large households spitting out a large amount, the market fell back a step, falling to 1,337 yuan. By 11 o'clock, the foreign exchange situation was very tight, and it returned to 1,345 yuan at the close. According to statistics, 5,630 bales were traded in half a day. The price of 10-count Double Horse yarn rose by 5 yuan. The amount bought by each gang is recorded on the left:</p>
<p>Fellow traders 5,610 Hong Kong 20</p>
<p>Statistics 5,630</p>
<p>The yarn market continued to be flat in the afternoon. The price of 20-count Double Horse yarn started at 1,340 yuan, followed by 1,341 yuan.</p>
<p>The cotton market is quiet.</p>
<p>The current situation of the machinery still has no special characteristics. The factories also lack large-scale development, so they are still in a quiet and stable state. The price of fire machines is 101 yuan, Changyinsha is 216 yuan, Brazilian cotton is 282 yuan, and Bailuo is 233 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e40">Piece Goods: Cotton Cloth is Popular <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>The factory cloth market was firm and rising yesterday. The popularity was enthusiastic, probably because the price of Dong cloth continued to rise sharply. The sales of fine cloth and twill from our factory were hindered by exports, and the sales prices were still low. Therefore, the appetite of recycling companies and dyeing factories gradually increased. Hand goods were in short supply, and the sales prices were gradually raised. The actual price of fine cloth opened at 35.5 yuan in the morning, and later rose to 36 yuan. The remaining lots also rose by 2.5 to 7.5 jiao. Fine twill rose by 2.5 to 5 jiao, coarse cloth and grey cloth rose by 2.5 to 5 jiao, and bleached and dyed cloth rose by about 5 jiao. The street traded more than 1,600 pieces of various cloths. The Zhejiang, Ningbo, and Taizhou gangs handled more than 300 pieces of Li cloth, coarse and fine cloth, and colored cloth. The Guangdong and Hong Kong gangs handled more than 500 pieces of coarse and fine cloth, colored cloth, bleached cloth, poplin, etc. The Jiangnan gang handled nearly 100 pieces of colored cloth and colored twill. 610 pieces of piece goods were shipped to Hong Kong on the 20th.</p>
<p>The price of Dong cloth rose sharply. The price of medium-grade fine cloth jumped wildly by more than 1 yuan per bolt. The price of the leading fine cloth rose by 8.75 jiao. The highest price was 38.7 yuan at the opening and 38.6 yuan at the close. The price of fine twill rose by 5 jiao per bolt. Serge rose by only 1.15 yuan, which is only 1 fen per yard. This is because the market lacks buyers due to the season.</p>
<h3 id="e41">The Trend of Italian Woolen Fabric - It Will Soon Disappear from the Market - <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>Italian woolen fabric has recently shown a sharp downward trend. The inventory in Shanghai is decreasing day by day, and sales are also weak. Its most famous numbers, 41,000, 7,000, 40,000, 14,000, and 18,000, as well as the floral fabric Harvey, will disappear from the market next year. Since the outbreak of the European War, foreign firms have changed their pricing to US dollars, and most require a deposit of 30-40%. War risk insurance and other expenses are very high, and the calculated cost is almost equal to that of British goods. Moreover, its arrival in port is uncertain, and new Italian ships cannot sail to Shanghai at all, so freight transportation is cut off. Moreover, most of it is spun from Shanghai weaving factories. According to general psychology, the selling price of Italian woolen fabric must be slightly cheaper than that of British-made woolen fabric, and the price of Japanese woolen fabric must be cheaper than that of Italian woolen fabric. The price of our factory's woolen fabric must be even cheaper than that of Japanese woolen fabric, otherwise, sales will inevitably be greatly affected. This is an unbreakable thing. Yesterday, the selling price of number 7,000 was 37-38 yuan in legal tender per yard, and the price of number 42,000 was 26-27 yuan, which was no higher or lower than the price one month ago, which shows how bleak it is.</p>
<h3 id="e42">Grains: Foreign Rice Has Become the Only Source of Sustenance for Citizens - Speculators Therefore Regard It as a Great Profit Opportunity and Buy It Whenever It Is Cheap - Japonica Rice Has Also Become a Luxury Food with Poor Sales <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>Since the implementation of price limits on foreign rice, it has been in a state of contempt for two consecutive dynasties. This is because the goods on the way have arrived one after another, and the orders have not been terminated due to the foreign exchange contraction. Yesterday, new transactions continued, and Changyi sold 1,000 tons of small grain for February delivery at a price of 81 yuan. There were also many other negotiations seeking a settlement. Moreover, the price of domestic rice has fallen sharply by 1-2 yuan yesterday. The market opened slightly calmer yesterday morning, and there seemed to be a downward trend. Number 2 Red Pagoda had once opened at the limit, and other assorted brand number 2 had fallen below the limit price by 1 yuan, opening at 80.05 yuan. The market price of Huojiao opened at 84 yuan and 83.5 yuan. Unexpectedly, after this depreciation, speculators suddenly rose up and took it directly, and the situation returned to the previous state, and the shouting price rose, causing a glimmer of dawn to be overshadowed by Yin Ling, and reached the old state of waiting for the limit. This is because foreign rice has become the only source of sustenance for the people, and speculators therefore regard it as a great profit opportunity, and they do not relax at all. They buy it whenever it is cheap and drag it away whenever they have goods. As a result, rice prices are easy to rise and difficult to fall. The heart of a tiger and wolf is more sinful than eating people with beasts. Therefore, the market fluctuates up and down and is still in a state of neither honor nor disgrace. Number 1 Saigon is 87 yuan, Number 2 is 81.5 yuan, and the final price is 80.05 yuan. Huojiao is 85 yuan to 83.5 yuan, Number 2 Siam is 80 yuan, 79.5 yuan, Xiaowen is 79 yuan, 78.5 yuan, Micha is 77.5 yuan, 77 yuan, Suited is from 75 yuan, and the final price is 70 yuan. Wuhu Jian is 78 yuan, 77.7 jiao, Number 2 Saigon for December delivery, the opening price of Jianyuan goods is 84 yuan, followed by 83.5 yuan, and Hezhong for January delivery is 86 yuan. Xiaojiao Rishin December 9 is 91 yuan, and January delivery is 81.5 yuan to 81 yuan. A total of 9,600 tons of original packages were opened throughout the day, and there were less than 3,000 packages of spot goods.</p>
<p>Although the arrival of domestic rice such as thick and thin Japonica rice is limited, the price of rice has risen sharply again and again, and the price is too high for ordinary civilians to afford. Domestic rice has become a luxury food, so there are mostly foreign rice buyers in shops, and there are few domestic rice buyers. In the associated relationship, the market sales are also unusually sluggish, so general cargo owners want to push up the price without success. Seeing that the market environment is bad, they all seek to let go, but it is difficult to invite demand. Therefore, it falls sharply by 2-3 yuan. The opening price of Kunshan Hu is 96-97 yuan for white Japonica rice, 101 yuan for Zhen Special, and 100 yuan for Qingjiao. The opening price of thin rice Hu is 88 yuan, 87 yuan.</p>
<p>The sales of glutinous rice are ultimately auxiliary products and are difficult to continue. Therefore, general speculators feel that the profit is small and the risk is high, and they all want to get rid of it. However, the thoughts are the same, and if you loosen, I will also loosen, suddenly creating a competitive selling trend. How can sales be sluggish and difficult to find a seller? As a result, although the market price has been cut by 1-2 yuan, the transaction volume is still scarce. If Yili opens at 94 yuan, and Hong Kong Baiyuan's high-quality goods have opened at 83-84 yuan, ordinary goods are only 83 yuan to 80 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e43">Foreign Flour: Over-the-Counter Transactions Are Quite Lively <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>The factory price of flour is still 18 yuan. The issue of increasing the price of cheap flour has not yet been approved by the authorities, so there is no change for the time being. After the Flour Market was banned from speculative trading by the Miscellaneous Grain Association, the market trading has disappeared. However, over-the-counter transactions are still quite lively. The price of Wild Boar brand Australian flour is 21.6 yuan, and the price of Flower Bird Clock Tower brand is 21.2-3 yuan, which is 3-4 jiao higher than before. The total market transaction volume by local customers is more than 5,000 bags. Although the price of cheap flour has not increased, the output of each factory has been sharply reduced, and there is news of a strike at the Fuxin factory, so the quantity allocated by the two factories is not enough for the needs of the street.</p>
<p>Wheat transactions are still lacking in development. The inventory of each product is depleted, and both Japanese and Chinese factories cannot operate smoothly. However, the cargo owners are hoarding and trying to push up the price. Yesterday, the price of rice flour has softened, so the purchase price of Chinese factories is also limited to 31 yuan. Japanese factories are still brewing and have not officially opened for business.</p>
<h3 id="e44">Oil Cake: The Oil Market Is Held Tightly <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's oil market was still forcibly held by domestic households. The trend throughout the day, whether it was soybeans, sesame, or miscellaneous grains, was monopolized by speculators, and the market price continued to rise by more than 1 yuan. However, the market atmosphere at the close was slightly unstable. According to statistics, 150 pieces of Jiaozhou raw oil were sold at a price of 87.5 yuan, 50 barrels of new goods at 89 yuan, 200 pieces of road goods at 89 yuan to 90 yuan, 200 barrels of Qingdao raw oil at 119 yuan to 120 yuan, more than 600 cans of Yantai canned new raw oil at a price of 117 yuan, 50 pieces of Yantai soybean oil at 83 yuan, 100 barrels of Dalian soybean oil at 112 yuan to 112.5 yuan, and 400 barrels for delivery in January were ordered at 113 yuan to 114 yuan, falling to 113 yuan. 600 pieces of Dayou Factory soybean oil were sold at 91.5 yuan to 92 yuan, and then to 91 yuan. 100 barrels of Youpu Dong Japanese factory oil were sold at a price of 88 yuan.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous grains were shipped out. On the 19th, 1,210 cans of raw oil came from Qingdao. On the 20th, 550 bags of soybeans, 9,080 pieces of soybean cake, and 300 bags of sesame were all shipped to Hong Kong.</p>

<p>Due to "market" factors, miscellaneous dried longan have recently turned over, causing the accumulation of goods arriving before and after, and the market has softened. The opening price of high-quality goods is less than half, and it has fallen by 350 yuan. Therefore, the market price has fallen, and the later opening prices of Xinghua goods have not been traded, and the profits are even smaller, not even enough to cover the cost.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the sugar market rebounded due to tighter foreign exchange rates. Dutch red sugar was the strongest. The association's price for spot goods was 75.5 yuan for 34 coarse white foreign banks, up 4 jiao. Dutch red sugar spot goods arrived at 60 yuan, and later rose by 2 jiao to 60.2 jiao. Road goods were 60.3 jiao to 5 jiao, up 7 jiao to 1 yuan. Taikoo cart white B mark was 75 yuan, HY mark was 71.6 jiao, and road goods were 71 yuan.</p>

<p>The United States has a great need for Tussah silk, but Shanghai has no silk to supply. There is a lot of stock of American white factory silk, and the sales of Japanese silk are very problematic. Therefore, according to the English Financial Business Newspaper, Japan is cutting down mulberry trees in the occupied areas of China, intending to prevent China from producing silk again and specialize in growing cotton to meet its own needs. The newspaper said that if this plan is realized, the silk industry in the silk-producing areas of Central China will be cut off. If it is to be revived, it must be after 50-60 years. In this way, the recent news that the "Central China" company has suspended the export of raw silk can also find a reason. However, 80% of the mulberry fields are in the guerrilla area, so the Japanese side's conspiracy to fundamentally destroy Chinese silk is unlikely to be realized.</p>

<p>Recently, due to the flooding of the Whangpoo River, the demand for washed coal dust has surged, and high-grade coal has become equally available as demand. Prices have remained stable. However, inferior coal dust can be used for blending, leading to a rush to purchase, and prices have risen without being artificially inflated. Wholesale prices among industry peers are: Zhufeng coal dust at 120 yuan per ton, Xishan coal dust at 100 yuan per ton, ex-warehouse, excluding handling fees. This is over ten yuan higher than the previous month.</p>

<h3 id="e49">Japanese Blockade Wangjia Lane, Demolish Houses on Taopeng Road; Another Thousand People Left Homeless; No Progress in Shanghai West Police Authority Agreement <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>Since the Japanese army demolished houses in Wangjia Village in Wangjia Lane, Daxilu, and ordered over 300 households to relocate, resulting in more than 1,000 people being displaced, they have now completely blockaded the lane with barbed wire fences. Three guards are stationed, and residents are not allowed to enter. Even speaking to residents inside the lane from outside the fence is interfered with. Most of the residents of Zhu'anbang have already moved out, with very few people entering or exiting between 7:00 AM and 5:00 PM yesterday. Furthermore, after the Japanese military doctor Nomura was assassinated on Taopeng Road, the Japanese side has also demolished civilian houses in the vicinity, following the harsh methods implemented in Shanghai West, and is opening up a new road. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>More Civilian Houses Demolished on Taopeng Road</p>
<p>According to the English-language Da Mei Evening News, a Japanese military doctor, Nomura, was assassinated on Taopeng Road in the Northern District of the Public Concession on the afternoon of the first day of this week. Today (December 19), over a hundred Chinese laborers, supervised by Japanese naval infantry, demolished over 50 houses in the area, leaving over 300 Chinese residents homeless. It is said that the Japanese side is constructing a new road in the area. It is expected that the Japanese side will continue to forcibly demolish civilian houses in the area, and the number of residents forced to relocate and left homeless will reach as many as 1,000.</p>
<p>Nomura Road Likely to be Opened</p>
<p>It has been found that since the end of September of this year, there have been 13 assassinations of Japanese military personnel in Shanghai. Among them, two military police officers, Sasaki and Saito, were assassinated in the Western District. The Japanese side then constructed two new roads in the area and named them "Sasaki Road" and "Saito Road." Now, a third new road is being opened in the Northern District, and it may also be named "Nomura Road." It is reported that the Chinese arrested by the Japanese on Sunday is the main suspect in the assassination of Nomura. However, the Japanese authorities remained silent on this matter this morning. It is said that the Chinese was arrested by Japanese naval infantry in an alley between Huacheng Road and Jining Road. Several others, who were carrying guns, were also arrested.</p>
<p>Report of Assassin's Capture Unconfirmed</p>
<p>According to the Shanghai Times, the Japanese naval infantry is currently intensifying the search for the assassin who shot and killed Japanese military doctor Lieutenant Nomura at the intersection of Taopeng Road and Huade Road on Monday afternoon. The rumor that the assassin, who escaped into a village near Jining Road, has been captured has not been confirmed as of yesterday (December 19). Japanese official sources claim that the suspect arrested on Tuesday has been identified as the main culprit in the case. However, they claim that based on the statements of the first batch of those arrested, it is hoped that other suspects can be captured for questioning. The police also stated that they were unaware of the developments in the Japanese side's large-scale search. At the same time, it is reported that a Chinese child who was injured by stray bullets during the Japanese pursuit of the assassin has been sent to Yangshupu Hospital, where the bullet was removed from his left buttock, and his condition is gradually improving.</p>
<p>Rickshaw Pullers Unwilling to Obtain Licenses</p>
<p>According to the Shanghai Times, the "Municipal Revenue Bureau" recently announced that all single-wheeled vehicles operating on the Shanghai West Extra-Settlement Roads must register and obtain licenses before the 16th of this month, otherwise they will not be allowed to enter the area. However, it is reported that very few rickshaws have gone to register, and the vast majority of rickshaws, automobiles, and trucks continued to display Municipal Council licenses and operate as usual yesterday (December 18). The "Municipal" regulations require a monthly rickshaw license fee of 12 yuan, but rickshaw pullers claim that they do not want to obtain new licenses because rickshaw business in the Western District is currently very poor and not worth the 12 yuan license fee. In addition, negotiations between rickshaw pullers and Municipal Council representatives regarding the proposal to organize a rickshaw franchise company in the city are expected to be completed within a few days. However, the specific terms under which the Municipal Council will grant rickshaw privileges are not yet known.</p>
<p>Police Authority Agreement Not Finalized</p>
<p>According to the English-language Da Mei Evening News, it is rumored today (December 19) that negotiations between the Municipal Council and the "Municipal" government on the issue of the Shanghai West Extra-Settlement Roads are proceeding smoothly. However, according to the "Municipal" side, the "Municipal" authorities have not yet studied the matter. The draft of the Western District agreement between the Municipal Council and the "Municipal" government in February of this year is expected to receive the attention of the "Municipal" authorities soon, but the "Municipal" side has not yet taken concrete steps. It has been found that the police chiefs of both sides have recently drafted detailed police authority agreements for the Extra-Settlement Roads area and submitted them to their respective municipal authorities for final consideration and signature.</p>
<p>Tax Revenue Situation Remains Unchanged</p>
<p>According to a Municipal Council spokesperson, the Council is awaiting a reply from the "Municipal" side on this matter and believes that the issue will be resolved soon. As for the tax revenue situation in the Extra-Settlement Roads area, it remains unchanged. The rumors that the two sides will only establish a police authority agreement and a joint police force after agreeing on the tax revenue issue are inaccurate.</p>
<p>Caojiadu Suddenly Blockaded Again</p>
<p>The situation in Caojiadu, Shanghai West, which had been experiencing abnormal prosperity, suddenly changed dramatically yesterday. The reason for this sudden change was that a large number of Japanese soldiers and "police" suddenly mobilized around Caojiadu at 6:00 PM the day before yesterday, carrying large batches of barbed wire, and set up barriers in the middle of the road at various key entrances to Caojiadu, such as (1) the intersection of Robison Road, (2) the intersection of Great Western Road, (3) the intersection of Brenan Road, (4) the entrance to Xinkangli on Connaught Road, (5) the rear intersection of Great Western Road at Wujiaochang, (6) the intersection of Great Western Road at Xinkangli, etc., leaving only entrances and exits for passage. Several Japanese military police and "police" were stationed beside the barbed wire, with the "police" inspecting passing pedestrians. The No. 7, No. 10, and No. 2 buses of the British-owned China General Omnibus Company, which originally terminated at Caojiadu, temporarily changed their terminus to the Singapore Road station because the gap in the barbed wire on Great Western Road was too narrow and the buses were too large to pass through.</p>
<h3 id="e50">Restoration of Customs Clearance at Zhejiang and Fujian Ports Not Yet Realized <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>In order to exclude third countries from trading with China, the Japanese Navy blockaded ports in Zhejiang and Fujian, such as Xiangshanpu, Zhenhai, Wenzhou, Sandu'ao, and Fuzhou, on July 15 of this year, citing military necessity. On August 14, it announced the expansion of the blockade of the coasts of Fujian and Zhejiang on the 15th, including eight locations such as Haiping, Zhapu, Xinghua Bay, Meizhou Bay, and Quanzhou. As a result, water traffic between Shanghai, Zhejiang, and Fujian was completely disrupted. For many months, although foreign ships occasionally sailed, they were all risky voyages, and were often detained. Yesterday, a certain newspaper reported that customs clearance had been restored at ports in Zhejiang and Fujian. Foreign shipping companies believed that since navigation had been suspended for a long time, the restoration of customs clearance would mean the possibility of resumption of navigation. However, when they inquired with the customs, the customs knew nothing about the aforementioned restoration of customs clearance. As a result, the companies were extremely disappointed. According to those familiar with the matter, the blockade between Shanghai and Zhejiang has been in place for a long time, and the resumption of navigation is unlikely to be realized in the short term. Recently, although Minhe and Changde plan to sail to eastern Zhejiang, there has been no report of them applying for customs clearance or where they are heading. Moreover, there is no news of the release of the German ships Moufu, Haifu, and Feikang, and the American ship Dasheng, which were detained in Zhoushan.</p>
<h3 id="e51">American Consulate Protests Japanese Interference with American Radio Station; American Station's Generators Very Powerful; Rumor of Retaliation Against Japanese Stations <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>The radio war between the United States and Japan in the Far East was brewing yesterday (December 19). It is rumored that the XMHA American-owned China American Broadcasting Station in the city has been interfered with by the Japanese side for four days due to its broadcasting programs. Unless the Japanese side immediately stops the interference, the American station will retaliate against the Japanese stations in the city.</p>
<p>Mr. Hailey Expresses Determination to Fight to the End</p>
<p>Mr. Hailey, the manager of China American Broadcasting Station, said that he had heard the above news, but refused to say whether he intended to retaliate. Hailey also said that "we certainly will not give up here, but will fight to the end to defend American rights."</p>
<p>American Consul General Lodges Protest</p>
<p>It is reported that the American Consul General in Shanghai has lodged a protest with the Japanese authorities regarding the Japanese interference with the wavelength of China American Broadcasting Station. According to a staff member of the consulate, the American authorities pointed out in the protest document that the rumors "attribute the responsibility for this matter to the Japanese side," so please provide a detailed report from the Japanese Consul General and stop the interference.</p>
<p>The Origin of the Dispute Lies with the Japanese Side</p>
<p>Hailey also stated that the interference with China American Broadcasting Station is due to the Japanese Radio Management Office. He had received a letter from the head of the management office requesting that he limit the power of China American Broadcasting Station to 200 watts and submit news to the Japanese side for inspection before broadcasting it. It is generally believed that if a radio war between the United States and Japan occurs, the two Japanese stations in the city (call signs XQHA and XOJB) will be unable to broadcast because the American station's generators are powerful enough to disrupt both Japanese stations.</p>
<p>American Generators Can Retaliate</p>
<p>If the radio war intensifies, American generators can disrupt all Japanese stations set up abroad, and China American Broadcasting Station itself can make it impossible for anyone to listen to the large station in Tokyo (call sign JOAK), which broadcasts long and short waves to the United States, the Dutch East Indies, and Malaysia. The long-wave broadcasts of China American Broadcasting Station today are still subject to interference, but the short-wave broadcasts can be heard clearly.</p>
<h3 id="e52">Hong Kong Rice Allowed to be Shipped to Shanghai in Large Quantities; Rice Shops Selling at Low Prices <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>A certain rice shop received a telegram from its counterpart in Hong Kong yesterday, stating that "Hong Kong rice prices have gradually declined since the authorities announced standard prices. The authorities are also strictly preventing rice merchants from taking advantage, ordering the police to pay attention to the retail prices of rice merchants, with violators facing a fine of 1,000 yuan or 12 months in prison. They are also allowed to transfer large quantities of rice to Shanghai for adjustment." Therefore, Hong Kong rice is expected to arrive in succession.</p>

<p>Although retail sales at the city's rice shops are still being carried out at the original prices, taking a commission of 1.5 yuan per picul, the rice is mixed with inferior goods or impurities, so the profits are still quite large. It is hoped that the authorities will pay attention to this and severely punish those who are found to be selling rice containing impurities to curb their misdeeds. According to news from the rice industry yesterday, some rice shops in the city are voluntarily selling low-priced rice, which is slightly cheaper than non-low-priced rice, but the quality of the rice is worse. It is hoped that the Rice Shop Guild will rectify this.</p>
<p>Universally Implemented</p>
<p>At the same time, it is still hoped that the guild will lead its members to universally sell low-priced rice. All members of the guild should set up a low-priced sales point in each store, limit the amount of rice sold each day, and stipulate the quantity limited per person. This should be maintained persistently and only stop when rice prices fall to a certain level, so that it can benefit the common people.</p>

<h3 id="e55">The Charity Relief Shelter Opened Early Yesterday - Sudden Cold Weather Causes Many Poor People to Freeze to Death in the Streets - Charity Association's Winter Clothing to be Distributed in a Week - New Pharmaceutical Businesses Sell White Rice at Low Prices - The Scene is Extremely Tragic <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>The weather has slightly warmed up since yesterday. According to the Xujiahui Observatory, the lowest temperature last night rose to above 30 degrees Fahrenheit, which is much warmer than the previous day. However, as a result of the cold wave hitting the city, the number of frozen corpses in the streets has increased sharply. According to reports from the Pushan Villa and Tongren Fuyuantang, over two hundred corpses, large and small, were collected and buried on the 18th alone.</p>
<p>The Relief Shelter Opened Early Yesterday</p>
<p>The Shanghai Charity Organizations Joint Disaster Relief Association has been preparing for the establishment of the relief shelter for some time. The mat sheds built on the Yan Family Residence in Difeng Road are now complete, and all the beds have been installed, accommodating 1,600 people. According to a reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency who inquired with the association, due to the sudden drop in temperature in the past two days and the daily deaths of poor people from freezing, the association started to receive poor people yesterday. Yesterday alone, more than two hundred people were taken in. From now on, the association will take in as many people as possible up to the full capacity. After being admitted to the shelter, the poor people will first take a bath and have their hair cut. Then, they will be given cotton clothes and trousers made by the association to change into, in order to maintain hygiene. Those who are sick will be treated, and those who have bad habits will be helped to quit, so that they can support themselves after leaving the shelter in the future. Regarding the daily sustenance of the above-mentioned poor people, the association has also stipulated two meals a day: lunch at 12:00 noon and dinner at 5:00 PM, with each meal providing enough food for them to eat their fill.</p>
<p>Actively Preparing to Distribute Steamed Buns</p>
<p>In addition, the association will separately distribute clothing and rice, as well as steamed buns and ginger soup. Last year, hundreds of thousands of people received these items. This year, the prices of rice and flour have soared to unprecedented levels, and the poor cannot make a living. Therefore, the distribution of steamed buns is extremely urgent. The association has already started to work on it and has sent a letter to Director-General He of the Public Works Department to find a location. Once the location is found, the distribution will begin. However, the expenses required for the above items are very large and depend entirely on donations. There is no shortage of enthusiastic philanthropists in Shanghai, and it is hoped that they will generously donate to benefit the poor. If there are donations, they can be directly sent to the association's office at No. 35 Renji Hall, Yunnan Road.</p>
<p>Charity Association Distributes Winter Clothing Coupons</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai office of the China Charity Association for Children started soliciting donations for winter clothing for those in need on the 20th of last month, the deadline was originally yesterday. According to the association's statistics up to yesterday, it has received donations of 23,000 yuan in winter clothing money, more than 200 new cotton clothes, and more than 800 old cotton clothes from all walks of life. The association originally stipulated that each set of new cotton clothes and trousers cost six yuan, but now, in order to increase the quantity, it has decided to invite merchants to bid tomorrow morning to rush the production of 2,000 sets of cotton clothes and trousers, which can be made and distributed in a week. The solicitation period has been extended to the end of the year. In order to distribute the clothing universally and eliminate all malpractices, the association has sent staff to four districts, including Avenue Eduard VII, Avenue Dubail, Zhaojia Ferry, and Xujiahui, to conduct on-site investigations, first distributing winter clothing tickets to homeless street children and impoverished households, and then issuing winter clothing based on the tickets. Any educational organization that needs winter clothing for children can submit a list of children, and the association will investigate and distribute the clothing according to the list. The association also welcomes people from all walks of life to participate in the distribution and hopes that people from all walks of life will pay attention to needy children at any time and apply for distribution on their behalf. Currently, more than one hundred people have been reported and issued.</p>

<h3 id="e60">Norwegian Ships Ceasing Rentals to Japan is of Great Significance - Japanese Rentals of Norwegian Ships are Quite Numerous - Most Will Expire Within Three Months <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>Shanghai's "Times" newspaper reported that the shipping industry in the city was abuzz yesterday (the 18th) with rumors of a large number of Norwegian ships ceasing to be rented to the Japanese. In the current special wartime situation, officials can neither confirm nor deny this rumor, but all parties agree that Norway's move is of great significance in both commercial and political terms.</p>
<p>The Cessation of Rentals is Unconfirmed</p>
<p>Since Germany occupied Norway, the Norwegian government moved to London, and its directly affiliated Norwegian Shipping and Trade Committee requisitioned all Norwegian ships for direct control, working closely with the British government, as did other Allied countries. There is no official news in Shanghai regarding the cessation of Norwegian ship rentals to the Japanese. The rental of Norwegian ships is negotiated directly between the applicant and the Norwegian Shipping and Trade Committee, and then transferred to Shanghai. The Norwegian consulate in Shanghai has not yet received news of the cessation of Norwegian ship rentals to the Japanese and can only infer changes in the lessee from the arrival of Norwegian ships in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Great Importance Attached by All Parties Here</p>
<p>Currently, only two Norwegian ships are regularly sailing to Shanghai under Japanese charter, and no changes in tenants have been seen. In view of the recent political changes and the close connection between the British and Norwegian governments, and the fact that Britain needs more merchant ships, the rumor of Norwegian ships ceasing rentals is taken seriously by the general public. The number of Norwegian ships rented by the Japanese is uncertain, but it is known to be quite large, as the Japanese have a clear shortage of their own ships, which are insufficient for wartime transportation. There are also many Norwegian oil tankers and cargo ships leased to the Japanese that operate along the Chinese coast. If the rumor of cessation of rentals is true, the Japanese will likely lodge a strong protest. It is heard that the leases of most Norwegian ships rented by the Japanese will expire within three months.</p>

<p>The English-language "China Press" reported that last night (the 18th), five Japanese soldiers in a military truck at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Sichuan Road cut through a red light, resulting in a violent collision with a British-owned No. 15 public bus. All the Japanese soldiers were injured and were rushed by ambulance to the Fumin Hospital on North Sichuan Road. One of them suffered serious head and body injuries and is still (the 19th) being treated at Fumin Hospital this morning.</p>
<p>Life in Danger</p>
<p>The other four soldiers suffered minor injuries to their faces and limbs and were discharged after being bandaged. It is reported that the Public Concession Police Department is thoroughly investigating the case and will likely record the testimony of the four slightly injured Japanese soldiers. After the Japanese truck collided with the public bus, the front wall of the Datong Bank at the corner of Nanjing Road and Sichuan Road was also slightly damaged. Oil stains are still visible on the wall this morning, and the glass shards and bloodstains on the road in front of the bank have not yet been cleared.</p>
<p>Not Yet Cleared</p>
<p>The "No Parking" sign erected by the Police Department at the road corner was also knocked down. It is reported that the accident was caused by the Japanese military truck traveling south along Sichuan Road at a speed of 40 to 50 miles per hour. The public bus was traveling along Nanjing Road towards the Bund. According to eyewitnesses, when the Japanese military truck was about to reach Nanjing Road, the traffic light turned red, but the Japanese military truck did not stop and instead accelerated forward, resulting in a violent collision with the public bus, with a loud crash.</p>
<p>Extremely Violent Force</p>
<p>The truck was thrown out and crashed straight into the Datong Bank. The public bus also crashed onto the sidewalk. The driver and conductor were severely shaken. Fortunately, there were no passengers in the bus. Traffic at the site was blocked for fifteen minutes. A fire department ambulance arrived and took the Japanese soldiers to Fumin Hospital.</p>
<h3 id="e62">Japanese Military Police Informants Held in Shackles to Extort Copper Dealers - Two Criminals Arrested and Escorted for Interrogation Yesterday Morning <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>Liang Long (24 years old) and Guo Ziliang (23 years old), both from Ningbo, who worked as informants for the Japanese Military Police Yangshupu Team, were arrested by Chinese detective Jin Wanrong and others from the Yangshupu Police Department at the intersection of Meizhou Road and Pingliang Road at around 8:00 PM the night before on suspicion of intimidation, fraud, and robbery. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the First Special Court to apply for a change of date in accordance with the law. Judge Jiang Shuzi presided over the hearing in the Third Criminal Court. Detective Jin Wanrong's report stated that the defendants, yesterday, holding "shackles and Japanese Military Police informant cards, arrested old copper dealers Xu Longxi and Zhou Wanxing and inquired about where they sold the old copper they bought every day. Xu and others then led the two defendants, Liang and Guo, to No. 379 Baoding Road to recover the stolen goods. The owner of the old copper shop, Hang Bingqing, fearing that he would be arrested, was willing to pay 100 yuan to settle the matter, but the defendants were not satisfied and claimed that if they wanted to settle the matter, they would have to increase the amount. The two small vendors, Zhou and Xu, then begged the defendants to release them, promising that they would each pay 30 yuan. Later, when Zhou's wife, Chen, was trying to raise money, the police detected it and sent me to lead the detectives to arrest the defendants. When we investigated with the Military Police, the Military Police only admitted that the defendants were informants of their team. I believe that the defendants were sent to arrest people with instruments of torture to extort money. The police are currently conducting an investigation. Please approve a change of date from your court." Judge Jiang reviewed the situation and briefly questioned the defendants before ordering a change of date. The defendants were all remanded in custody.</p>

<p>Wang Wenying, the 21-year-old daughter of Wang Zhengjia, the director of Yihua Hospital at 200 Avenue Albert, French Concession, is naturally romantic and does not follow family instructions. She associates with the wrong people and has recently become acquainted with Yu Ziren and Zhu Jinrong, employees of the Six Nations Hotel gambling den. Instigated by Yu and others, she stole three sets of her father's Western suits worth 2,000 yuan and silver cups, and squandered the money she got from pawning them. After Wang Zhengjia found out, believing that she would not repent unless she was given appropriate punishment, he reported it to the police, who arrested Wang Wenying and sent her to the First Special Court for interrogation and detention. Now, because Wang's daughter has suffered greatly in prison and has expressed repentance, Wang Zhengjia requested that the case be withdrawn at the court hearing yesterday morning. The police lawyer, Fang Tongju, did not oppose it. The court then approved the withdrawal and released Wang Wenying.</p>

<h3 id="e65">China's Wartime Finances Will Become More Optimistic in the Future - Report by the US Commercial Attaché <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>According to a report by the US Commercial Attaché in this city to Washington, the Chinese government's expenditures for the year 1940 will reach about 350 million yuan due to high prices and heavy military needs. Due to the impact of the war, tax revenues have declined, and expenditures have exceeded revenues, so wartime public bonds have been issued to make up for the deficit. A total of 120 million yuan in military public bonds and the same number in financial public bonds have been issued this year. The military public bonds were issued in two installments of 600 million yuan each on March 1st and September 1st. The above-mentioned public bonds have not yet been used up, and in September, the US announced a loan of 25 million US dollars to China, and in December, another loan of 100 million US dollars. The UK has also loaned 10 million pounds to China, which, according to the open market exchange rate, amounts to 270 million yuan in legal tender. Recently, there have been reports that the Soviet Union has loaned China 100 million yuan to purchase Chinese tea. According to the Sino-Soviet barter trade, the exchange rate of legal tender is calculated according to the official Chinese exchange rate, so the credit loan of 100 million yuan, calculated according to the black market, also amounts to 50 million yuan. China's wartime finances will become more optimistic in the future.</p>

Although the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications have gradually recovered them, the banknotes of the eight banks circulating in the market are still valid."</p>

<p>The Shenbao Cup Sino-American Charity Basketball Championship: After a minor setback in the first match, the Chinese team revamped its lineup last night and engaged in the first decisive battle with the American team at the Western Youth Basketball Hall. The Chinese team fielded its best lineup, which indeed refreshed the audience and greatly boosted morale, leading all the way. The American team was completely thrown into a state of panic. In the first half, the Chinese team led by thirteen to eight, a five-point advantage. In the second half, the Chinese team's momentum did not wane. At its peak, it led by as much as twenty-six to sixteen, a ten-point advantage. The Chinese team's performance was so wonderful that it could be called unprecedented. For a time, the atmosphere on the court was so tense that it was almost white-hot. The American team fought like cornered beasts, desperately chasing. At this most critical three-minute mark, Zhang Shaoqing, a key player of the Chinese team, was unfairly penalized out by referee Bratt for a minor matter. Consequently, the American team scored four consecutive points at the end, reversing the defeat into a victory with thirty-eight to thirty-five. The fans and philanthropists who supported the Chinese team were greatly disappointed and sighed in unison. But success or failure is up to fate, not the fault of the battle. What more can be said?</p>
<p>Absolutely Not Discouraged, Continue to Strive</p>
<p>The Chinese team's near-success yesterday was unexpectedly changed in an instant. It was completely unexpected. The Chinese team was in the lead all the way in the first half. In the second half, it led by twenty-six to sixteen, a ten-point advantage. Judging from the momentum of the battle, the excellence of the entire team's performance, and the seamless coordination, the performance was truly the most enjoyable of this competition. Everyone thought that victory was no problem, but the result was another defeat. This is truly what is called fate, luck, and heaven's defeat of us. However, the Chinese team will never regret it. In the second match, it will continue to strive to vent its anger. The gain or loss of the championship is a small matter. It is hoped that enthusiastic fans and philanthropists will continue to support the Chinese team and help it vent its anger.</p>
<p>Leading All the Way by Five Points</p>
<p>The Chinese team started yesterday with Nianhua, Shaoqing, Xuechong, Nanzhen, and Zhenzhong. The American team initially responded with an all-white McLaughlin team. As soon as the two teams were ready, Walter opened the scoring with a free throw. Hengel added to the score. The American team took the lead with three points. Before long, Feng Nianhua scored under the basket. Li Zhenzhong made a one-handed shot. The Chinese team immediately took the lead by four to three. When Hengel re-entered the zone, the American team regained the lead. Nianhua made a one-handed shot. The Chinese team saw another turning point. On the American side, Mertler and Ting Huier were substituted. The battle situation still did not improve, and it was stuck in a stalemate for a full four minutes. During this time, the Chinese team wasted a lot of opportunities and missed many sure shots. After Walter made one free throw, the American team took the lead for the third time, but it was short-lived. The Chinese army immediately won victory after victory. Nianhua, Xuechong, and the three brothers scored in succession. The score increased sharply. In an instant, it was twelve to eight, and from then on, they led all the way. When Hai'er made a free throw, the lemon time arrived, and it was thirteen to eight. The Chinese team took the lead.</p>
<p>Great Momentum, Brilliant Radiance</p>
<p>Changing ends and fighting again, the Chinese team still responded with the original lineup. The American army urgently mobilized new force Cheden. Coach Klaus also personally came to direct the battle. He also added the famous general Carson. The foundation was changed to a military officer team. The dangerous figure Henshawitz also appeared. The combat effectiveness was completely different from before. After the battle, Zhang Shaoqing immediately played a miraculous role. The two sides fought evenly. The situation was flat, but after nineteen to fifteen, the Chinese team showed its edge. In an instant, Shaoqing and Nanzhen made three free throws, and Nianhua made two shots, adding seven points. The American team only made one free throw by Carson and one point. The score became twenty-six to sixteen. The Chinese team led by as many as ten points. The future was bright. Everyone thought that a joyous celebration was expected. Cheers resounded. This was the Chinese team's most prosperous period last night.</p>
<p>Near Success Turns to Failure, Major Change in the Situation</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, changes occurred unexpectedly. In this last ten minutes, the situation took a sharp turn. When Walter and Lu Qi hit like pearls, Zhang Shaoqing found the treasure. Twenty to twenty-eight, still leading by eight points. At this time, Henshawitz suddenly broke through to the center. Wang Nanzhen blocked him head-on. Unexpectedly, in addition to being shot, he also received two free throws. In addition, Lu Qi also scored. In one breath, six points were added, resulting in a close situation of twenty-eight to twenty-six. Misfortune did not come singly for the Chinese team. Zhang Shaoqing also hurt his eye and bled, which inevitably affected his movements. After Xuechong and Shaoqing added three points, although Simpson was penalized off, a tiger left and a wolf came. Ting Huier also went to the front line. Lu Qi chased to thirty-one to twenty-eight. The Chinese team gradually fell into a dangerous situation. The more they made a desperate counterattack, the more Shaoqing was penalized for one point. Then, he rushed in and violated Walter, and was penalized off the field. Although Zhongen was transferred up, Walter made three consecutive free throws. The American team had chased to thirty-two to thirty-one, with a difference of only one point. Although Zhuang Ji wanted to change from defense to offense, it was already impossible. Then, Shahewitz shot to thirty-three to thirty-two, taking the lead. In addition, the god of the ball was not spiritual. Feng Nian again missed the chance to score under the basket. In the long sighs of the audience, Walter caught the ball. As soon as the ball left the basket, the bell rang loudly. The Chinese team lost by a thread and suffered another miserable defeat with thirty-two to thirty-five.</p>

<p>(Daguang News Agency) The Shanghai Education Association is holding a thesis competition to encourage educational academic research and collect excellent theses for reference and adoption by the education sector.

<p>Since the Shanghai office of the Chinese Children's Welfare Association launched a campaign to solicit winter clothes for poor children in the city, it has received enthusiastic support from major companies and school authorities, and has raised more than 23,000 yuan in winter clothing donations. It is heard that the event was originally scheduled to end yesterday (the 19th). It is learned that the association has extended the solicitation date to the end of this year because the results of the solicitation are good, but there is still a big gap from the predetermined goal, and some schools have not been able to submit all the donations to the association due to time constraints. In addition, the association, in view of the urgent need for clothing for poor children in the city, has decided to invite merchants to bid at the association hall at 11:00 AM on the 21st of this month, and will distribute 2,000 sets of weak winter clothing at any time. They also continue to appeal to all sectors to embody the virtue of heaven and the compassion of mankind, and quickly donate money, with each new set of winter clothing costing six yuan, so that they can make more winter clothing to benefit the general refugee children.</p>

<p>Since the Aurora University Library in this city made the books donated by Mr. Ding and Mr. Li publicly available, those who requested to borrow them have flocked to the door, which shows the urgency of the social figures in Yishi to seek knowledge. It is learned that Hu Daojing has donated more than 200 kinds of specialized books on "Library Science" to the library. Recently, he has donated more than 2,000 volumes of his late father, the late Sinologist Hu Huaichen's manuscripts, to the library. It is heard that there are many rare copies in this collection of books, all of which were painstakingly collected by Mr. Hu during his lifetime. Their categories are especially unique. One is the songbooks and reading materials for enlightenment in ancient China, with dozens of types, all subjects are available, and occasionally there are Western translations or Mongolian explanations. This so-called "Three Hundred Thousand Thousand" textbook was widely circulated in the past few hundred years. In recent times, historians have paid much attention to it, and Hu's collection is the most complete. One is the Chinese writings of ethnic minorities in the border areas, also with dozens of types, which are not easy to obtain for those who study the history of the spread of our culture. Mr. Hu did not finish sorting it out and died with his ambitions, which is truly regrettable. Other historical materials about folk literature are also numerous. It is heard that the library has now listed this legacy of doctors as a "special collection" and has begun cataloging it for the reference of scholars.</p>

<p>— Li Song</p>
<p>Because the food rice is about to run out, I entrusted relatives a few days ago to purchase a bag from a familiar grain shop. Of course, the price can be cheaper than ordinary millet shops, and the quantity can be more substantial.</p>
<p>At nine o'clock in the morning, the relative called to inform: "…It has been loaded onto a rickshaw and transported out…It is cheap…Sixty-eight and a half yuan…"…Indeed, the price is much cheaper, after all, you can't do without an "old hand"!</p>
<p>Although rickshaws are slow, they can probably arrive in an hour, but when it was half past eleven, it had not arrived yet, and I couldn't help but become a little suspicious—the weather is cold and the year is approaching its end, a rickshaw driver sending goods alone, don't let anything happen? A bag of rice costs dozens of foreign dollars, which is no child's play!</p>
<p>While eating lunch, someone knocked on the door. I opened the door and saw a coolie holding a piece of paper. The address of my home was written on the paper. I thought that the rice had been delivered, so I told him to carry it in; however, I poked my head out and looked outside the door, where there was a rickshaw and rice. When I asked him, he said: "The rice was detained by the brothers with flat-topped hats and long guns, because there was no stamp on the delivery vehicle, and the owner of the goods had to go." I knew very well what colleagues these were, but if I didn't go, the goods would not be delivered, so I had no choice but to limit myself to going to see and handle the matter.</p>
<p>The rice cart was parked on the side of the road, and I was fortunate enough to have a "brother" assigned to guard it. When we met, I had to give a smile first, and then the negotiation began.</p>
<p>"Are you the owner of the goods?" That "brother" asked bluntly.</p>
<p>"Yes! Yes!" I could only say yes.</p>
<p>"Where did you buy the rice from?"</p>
<p>"I bought it from ×× grain shop."</p>
<p>"Why isn't there an invoice?"</p>
<p>"Because it was driven out of the warehouse (stack), the receipt has already been handed over to the warehouse, the rickshaw is delivering the goods with the delivery slip, so there is no invoice."</p>
<p>"Why is there no stamp? Now "the above" has an order to check the stamp tax. Without a stamp, you will be fined!"</p>
<p>"Probably the store didn't know the rules here, and forgot to put it on. Can you please "old fellow" be a little lenient?"</p>
<p>"That won't do!"</p>
<p>"Hey… just be casual…"</p>
<p>"I can be casual, but other brothers" can't be casual—"</p>
<p>"Please help me!"</p>
<p>"I will always help where I can help, everyone has a "number," right?"</p>
<p>"Of course! Of course!" So my hand couldn't help but reach into my pocket, took out two flower paper, "This is a small token, please "old fellow" and the "brothers" have a cigarette, a small token! Sorry! Sorry! Help me!"</p>
<p>"Okay, okay, not next time!"</p>
<p>"Yes! Yes!"</p>
<p>Thanks to his "help," I passed this big hurdle, and I spent two dollars to finally preserve a bag of white rice, great luck!</p>
<p>Continuing to move forward, the rickshaw driver was sweating, but he kept complaining for me, he said: "I have been pulling rickshaws for more than ten years, but I have never encountered this kind of thing." However, things were not only this, and then came the "inspector," without badges or markings, only wearing a "tiger skin," but also came to inquire: invoice? Stamp? It was still the same old routine, but I was "sensible" and handed over another flower paper with a "handshake." "Sorry, please help me" was also a big routine, and only then did I pass the second hurdle.</p>
<p>With great difficulty, I entered the alley, the rice was carried into the house, two yuan for the rickshaw puller, five jiao for wine money, a total of five yuan and five jiao, but things have already come to this, so I can only admit that I was unlucky. But looking back, experiencing this kind of thing can also invisibly increase a lot of "knowledge."</p>

<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>(5) Love Birds in Mandarin Duck Lake</p>
<p>It was nearly noon when Chen Wozi sent away a friend. In his small Langhuanzhai study, he held a scroll in his hand and sat silently, burning incense. Suddenly, the study servant reported that a guest was asking to see him. Chen Wozi asked who it was and if he had a visiting card. The study servant replied: "The visiting guest has no visiting card, he only said that he was introduced by Mr. Hou Fangyu from Jinling." Chen Wozi was arrogant by nature and did not like to receive outsiders. Now that he heard that it was introduced by Hou Fangyu, he nodded and said: "Please invite him in." Before long, the study servant led in a beautiful young man with a face like jade and luxurious clothing. He bowed deeply to him as a greeting. As soon as Chen Wozi saw this beautiful young man, although he came suddenly, his appearance seemed familiar, but he couldn't think of it for a moment. So he invited the young man to sit. The study servant offered fragrant tea. Chen Wozi then asked the beautiful young man his name. The beautiful young man said: "My name is Xu Huan, I have long admired your public name, so I asked Mr. Hou to introduce me, and I came to visit you especially." Chen Wozi said: "Do you have a letter?" The beautiful young man shook his head and said: "I did have one, but I lost it on the way. Moreover, there is also an important matter for me to see you this time. Mr. Hou wants me to say it to you face to face, so that it will not leave any traces." Chen Wozi asked: "What is the matter?" The beautiful young man said: "You are a famous scholar in the world, and you should have a beautiful woman in the world to add fragrance to your red sleeves and serve you with towels and combs. Nowadays, Liu Rushi is a humble woman of the entertainment industry, but she knows poetry and understands the body, and she is beautiful and talented. She is a rare woman among women. She wants to serve famous scholars in the world in her heart, and she wrote a letter to Mr. Hou. Therefore, Mr. Hou entrusted me to come forward today, I don't know if you also think that Liu Rushi is a desirable person?" As soon as Chen Wozi heard these words, he looked at the beautiful young man's face, and then observed that the beautiful young man's waist was graceful, very much like a boudoir person, and he understood a little in his heart. He thought to himself that the falling flowers are intentional, but the flowing water is ruthless. I have already indulged in meditation and avoided the demons of love. How can I fall into the enchanting array myself? I have to disappoint her a little. I entrusted Huang Yuqi to guide Qian Muzhai to meet her in her dressing room, which was originally intended to make their marriage a success. I thought that the only way to get him to Liaoshi was to persuade me, so I didn't have to say it. I just had to refuse sternly to dispel her heart, which is also indirectly promoting the success of Qian and Liu. So his face sank, and he replied resolutely: "Liu Rushi is indeed a beautiful woman in the world, and I am grateful for Mr. Hou's elegant intention to act as a matchmaker. But I have been eager to learn Buddhism in recent years and have cut off all the luxuries. I have no intention of hiding a beauty in a golden house, so I have to live up to the good intentions. I beg you to convey my thanks to Mr. Hou, and thank Rushi, and don't think about me anymore. Chen Wozi's last sentence was very decisive. When the beautiful young man heard it, his face suddenly changed color, his eyebrows furrowed, and he said again: "Is what you said true?" Chen Wozi said: "How dare I lie and offend? My heart is already decided, don't bother me with more words." After saying that, he closed his eyes and issued an order to leave. (15)</p>
<h3 id="e87">New Year <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>— Zuo Hui</p>
<p>The glass windows of large companies are decorated with snow scenes, gifts, New Year's cards, and the like, which is a way of telling people: It's New Year's time again. "What about the New Year?" the poor will say; the rich are busy, giving gifts, feasting, playing around... This group of people, who usually eat fish and meat almost every day, are celebrating their "little New Year" there. Now, as Mr. Yang said in the living room: "The end of the solar calendar year is here, we're going to celebrate the solar New Year!"</p>
<p>Mr. Yang has notified all his friends of this good news, telling them to be on time. Mr. Yang wrote a list, estimating that there would be four or five large tables. The living room and front building can't accommodate so many people, so the attic has to be temporarily borrowed as well. As for the dishes, Mrs. Yang has also decided, she said: "It's too much trouble to make the dishes myself, so it's better to just order a few tables. Let's be 'economical' and get the 40-yuan ones!"</p>
<p>Mrs. Yang is the best at coming up with ideas. A recent maid quit because she couldn't stand her many contradictory ideas. So she says it's more convenient to order a few tables of dishes, but in fact, she can't cook at all.</p>
<p>Another guest came. First thing, Mr. Yang clapped a few times and said: "Old [name], we've notified everyone else, but we forgot you. Let me tell you, we're celebrating the New Year!"</p>
<p>"So early?" the guest said.</p>
<p>"Not early," Mr. Yang said with a raised eyebrow, "We're celebrating the solar calendar New Year."</p>
<p>"Solar calendar New Year, that's a new invention." The guest laughed: "Mr. Yang, don't be so busy. After the solar calendar New Year, will you still celebrate the lunar calendar New Year? Otherwise—"</p>
<p>"The solar calendar New Year is for the solar calendar New Year. This is indeed my new invention; but don't worry, the lunar calendar New Year will still be celebrated the same way." Mr. Yang is just so happy that his joint-stock rice shop has made too much money. His company has at least several thousand in bonuses. When the end of the year comes, he just has to wait to collect them. Isn't it great to have fun and treat guests more often! Finally, Mr. Yang added: "This time, let's keep it small and be 'economical'. Next time, we'll do it again in a big way."</p>
<p>"Then my mouth will be happy! Excellent." The guest smiled...</p>
<p>Once, twice, Mr. Yang's two children often ran over to hug my legs and shout: "We're going to celebrate the New Year!"</p>
<p>"New Year," hearing this name, I couldn't help but let out a bitter laugh from my heart: The wealthy people in Shanghai are really smart. Compatriots in other places would never think of these things.</p>
<h3 id="e88">Starting from "X Ancestor" <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>— Zuo Zhuan</p>
<p>Although the "poor kid" doesn't want to eat or buy anything, he still has to read the newspaper carefully. Of course, he doesn't flip to the "rental" or "lost" ads in the date section, but the advertisements are unavoidable in my eyes.</p>
<p>Today, I immediately saw a rather "novel" seasoning called "X Ancestor".</p>
<p>The advertisement said: "Inside there are ten-yuan and five-yuan banknotes; ten-pound and five-pound bags of white rice..." and also: "One-yuan, five-jiao, one-jiao, five-fen banknotes in abundance..." After reading it, I couldn't help but be so happy that I was "jumping with joy". Banknotes, white rice, who wouldn't want them? Who wouldn't need them?</p>
<p>Later, after thinking carefully: this "ancestor" can't be "invited back" with just one stick of sandalwood and two strings of long ingots; it also requires money to buy, no money, no chance!</p>
<p>Therefore, I was also reminded of the advertisements for "tonics", "coats", "Western food" and the like that fill the newspapers.</p>
<p>What they say is not wrong: Supplement if the body is weak; wear clothes if the body is cold; eat when the stomach is hungry!</p>
<p>However: Whether I will freeze to death this year is still a question, let alone "tonics"? Being able to have a tattered cotton-padded jacket is already "Namo Amitabha", how dare I hope for a "coat"? A bowl of cold porridge and a piece of pancake, "surpasses building a seven-story pagoda," eating "Western food" would be "a waste of me"!</p>
<p>In fact, after careful consideration, I understand that there is no need for me to shout injustices in a "vicious" way. Advertisements have their own target audience. They were never intended to be seen by a poor kid anyway!</p>
<p>That's really "nervousness".</p>

<h3 id="e89">Mourning Shen Xiling <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>— Qiu Yu</p>
<p>Drama Society sends telegram of condolence to Ms. Xiong Hui. Zhou Jianyun and Yu Ling are in charge of memorial affairs.</p>
<p>The news of the death of young playwright Mr. Shen Xiling in Chongqing due to illness has spread to Shanghai. Whether they knew him or not, everyone felt extremely惋惜!</p>
<p>He, Mr. Shen Xiling, had a gentle and quiet temperament and a spirit of diligent study. After he returned from studying in Japan, he took on the installation work for Tianyi Film Company. Because of his rich knowledge and cultivation, he soon became a film screenwriter and director. His first directed work was "The Cry of Women" (starring Wang Ying). His successful works are "Crossroads" (starring Zhao Dan, etc.) and "Shanghai Twenty-Four Hours."</p>
<p>He, Mr. Shen Xiling, was truly a versatile young man. Not only did he have such high achievements in film, but he also made great contributions to the stage. The "Wu Zetian" he directed was sold out for more than a month, almost shocking the theater world. "Dreaming and Dying," which he co-directed with Song Zhi, also left an indelible impression on people.</p>
<p>After "August 13th", he bravely left Shanghai and turned to the embrace of the motherland. In Chongqing, he married the actress Xiong Hui. He found a source of spiritual comfort, and he devoted himself to meeting the important tasks of the times. In China Film Studio, he was one of the most hardworking members.</p>
<p>Who would have thought that such a hardworking artist would leave us so early?</p>
<p>No one among the theater workers in Shanghai who heard this bad news did not feel sorry. The Shanghai Drama Society has sent a telegram to express their condolences to Mrs. Shen, Ms. Xiong Hui. And the film industry may re-screen his works during his lifetime to commemorate him!</p>
<p>While we mourn Mr. Shen Xiling, we cannot forget his hardworking spirit and inherit his unfinished work!</p>
<p>(According to reports, after the news of Shen Xiling's death came, those who knew him and those who did not mourned together. Regarding the memorial affairs, Zhou Jianyun, Yu Ling and other friends in Shanghai have initiated preparations, tentatively setting three methods. (1) Distribute a commemorative special issue in the supplements of various newspapers. (2) Collect Shen's posthumous drama scripts and hold commemorative performances. (3) Use Shen's last film work "Crossroads". Contact theaters for public screenings. However, after a discussion yesterday, the third method had some problems. It is feared that there is no existing copy of the "Crossroads" film. If a new one is to be reprinted, the current market price will be more than two thousand yuan. Preparations for this matter have begun.)</p>

<p>— Ti Gong</p>
<p>Among the several Kunju actresses who are changing customs and introducing new ideas, Yi Hua seems to appreciate Cao Xueqin very much. In the five-part "Wen Suchen", she was assigned to play the seventeenth concubine, Lin Gu. In terms of appearance, she looks six points like Yuan Meiyun. Her voice is very sweet, and her face is quite expressive. The most rare thing is that she sings a pipa song with great emotion. Originally, the scene of Li Youquan's family "offering the faces of sixteen concubines to Mr. Turtle" was entirely based on Lin Gu's戏膽. This character is lively, and Xin Fang and Lan Fang's plays are set off like lively dragons and tigers. Recalling the first performance of the five-part play this summer, the role was played by a Miss Wang, whose voice was as thin as a rat's squeak. So this scene was made lifeless. I remember that for Lin Gu's pipa song, I had painstakingly composed a tune, and the drummer on the stage, being a fool, had also painstakingly composed the gongchi. It was a pity that when Lin Gu sang it at that time, heaven and earth knew, but no one knew. I stood behind the curtain and listened for three nights in a row, but I couldn't hear a single word. At that time, I was indeed a little resentful, as if wounded. This breath was finally exhaled leisurely last night amid the Cao Xueqin's idle oriole whispers, flower bottom slippery, secluded spring water flowing, and the sound of rushing streams under the beach. Of course, my tune doesn't deserve to be called "literati's gem", but I still cherish it and I still want to deeply thank the "nightingale-like girl's throat" for venting my anger.</p>

<p>— Yong Zi</p>
<p>In the Shanghai art scene, film and drama are entering a revival era. Although, due to environmental factors, many things that they want to say and do cannot be brought out, the past achievements, especially in the drama world, are still satisfactory. They fully instilled consciousness into the audience, and also promoted many stage arts.</p>
<p>Recently, people from the film, drama, and music circles have jointly mobilized many talents to stage the song drama "Song of Shanghai" again. "Song of Shanghai" is a four-act song drama, and its songs have become the most popular programs on the radio. The reason is very simple, because every song in "Song of Shanghai" is very beautiful. Composer Zhang Haojun spent more than half a year working on "Song of Shanghai".</p>
<p>This decision, the greatest gain, is the general mobilization of the music world. In the past, enlightened people criticized Chinese music for not being progressive. The biggest obstacle was that talented musicians hid in their own circles and were unwilling to work for the public; they only knew how to study advanced music themselves, and neglected that most people were even more distant from them. This time, young men and women studying music are all voluntarily participating in the performance of "Song of Shanghai". The choir in "Song of Shanghai" is helped by Shanghai's most famous Guangdong Sacred Music Garden.</p>
<p>The actors include Bai Hong, Xia Xia, Meng Na, Yan Hua, Hong Wei, etc. The director is Yue Feng. The excellent talents from the previous "Song of Shanghai" will continue to perform, and the vacancies will be filled by those who study acoustics. Therefore, the success of the performance is predictable.</p>
<p>This performance of "Song of Shanghai" is the first performance after the establishment of the Yueyi Society. The date is the twenty-fifth of this month at the Lyceum Theatre, followed by the performance of China's first opera "Song of the Earth".</p>
<h3 id="e93">"Children's Paradise" One of the "Zhang Garden" Plans <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>The Continental Swimming Pool and the adjacent thirty-odd acres of open space (which was once used as the Yalin Olympic Circus) are merged into one place, and Zhang Shankun and Li Zulai invested in taking it over. Recently, Zhang Guanwen has also joined the partnership, and it has been decided to rename it "Zhang Garden". It is said that in addition to the natural scenery dedicated to adult appreciation, a "Children's Paradise" will also be opened, with the latest toys from British and American children's parks purchased to broaden the horizons of children. This is a new organization that combines education and entertainment. It is hoped that the "Zhang Garden" authorities can do more to benefit children. The children on the isolated island are like caged birds, too boring.</p>
