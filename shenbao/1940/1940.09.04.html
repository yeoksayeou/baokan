<h3>越南問題的兩個疑問</h3>
<p>到現在爲止，越南成爲問題者已歷兩個多月。以這一問題爲中心，在大家的心裏，不免有兩個沉重的疑問：（一）日本早就喧呼着，要向越南進攻，然而一直沒有實行。那末，她到底會不會眞正進攻越南？（二）前幾天的電訉，謂法國維希政府已經屈服，可是照這幾天來的消息大概可以反證屈服說的不可靠。然則將來是否會屈服於日本的要求呢？</p>
<p>第一，日本到底會不會眞正進攻越南？簡單地答復說：原則上是絕對不會的；然而却也許有例外。蓋日本向來傳統的對外擴張政策，有所謂南進與北進兩派的區別。前者的主要支持者，是海軍；而提倡後者最力的却是陸軍。這兩派互爭雄長，勢力不相上下。可是到了一九三七年，陸軍派終於發動對中國的侵略大戰，這就是說明北進派的勢力已經暫時壓倒了主張南進的海軍派。在這局勢之下，日本海軍一面封鎖全中國綿長的海岸綫，一面對英美取着極端的警戒態度，作守勢的防禦。於是這三年以來，日本確確實實的動員了牠所有的陸海空的力量，集中與中國作生死的搏鬥。因此之故，祗要中。日戰一天不結束，日本的所謂「南進」也者，祗是一個理論上的名詞而已。試問除了封鎖中國及對英美警戒的艦隊而外，牠那裏再可以分出一部海軍、進行其他海上戰爭的冒險呢？力量的比較，原來是相對的，日本經過了三年血戰的結果、牠整個的國力已經大大的降低，這在國際力量對比上，牠早已失去了侵略任何其他可以相當抵抗的國家的資格。在進行對中國大戰的多量消耗中，試問日本怎能再去籌備侵略第三國所必需的原料，資金，以及人力的補充與接濟？是以不管對於歐戰方酣中的南進大好機會，日本如何眼紅，也不管近衛內閣的南進調子怎樣響亮；然而日本既不能立刻翻然覺悟，放棄對中國的侵略，退出中國領七，則轉向南洋躍進，事實上答復以不可能。而目前所謂對越南的企圖，除了取得進攻中國雲南廣西的根據地，以爲達到其目的的唯一手段而外，也惟有威脅和逼迫，企望越南當局屈服而已</p>
<p>論大體，吾們自信前論的不謬，可是有一點，我們不得不特別陳述的：即是日本民族是富有感情衝動的民族，氣量狹小，不容異已。故於其無可奈何時，輒用悲壯的舉動去對付一切；每逢國家到了左右爲難，每每會出以悲壯的行動，不顧成敗利鈍，恣所欲爲；雖向越南開火，不能視爲意外。</p>
<p>第二，日本的一切脅逼，在法國維希政府會不會屈服，這是當前的疑問。此以維希政府的態度而論，不夠推論一切，然而經過了兩次撤換越南總督的結果，大體可以視爲具有莫大的決定作用。蓋以前的越南總督各保持其獨立行動，亦即對於貝當政府抗不奉命，則日本那時就大可以聲稱僅以越南爲對象而採取各種行動。及至現在，原任越南總督既由貝當政府調換，新任總督顯然接受了貝當領導下的政令，是可以想見越南今後的態度。所以今天進行於法日兩國之間的交涉，一面是日本，而對方却不啻就是德義兩國。在目前的國際形勢下，日本既沒有與德義衝突的勇氣，則日本壓迫越南至於屈服，可謂根本是不可能的。因此之故，日本所得企圖達到目的唯一途徑，祗有訴之於德，義的善意，由牠們勸說或壓迫法國維希政府，接受日本的要求。可是，這却有一個大前提：日本必須和德義合作，以切實的行動來在東方對付英國，吸引英國史多的海軍艦隊；若僅僅逮捕幾個英僑，或者在日本本國及中國淪陷區來幾個反央示威遊行，詎有絲毫用處！</p>
<p>所以，關於越南問題，實是德國對於日本最有效的試金石；試騐他對付英國，究有何種決心，何種力量，何種功效？易言之：目前的問題核心，是日本會不會接受德國的提議，並不是法國維希政府會不會屈服於日本的要求。</p>
<h3>英大使飛機抵渝　華人士關切滇緬路問題　對開放可能性意見不一</h3>
<p>重慶　英大使寇爾爵士、三日上午七時半由港乘中航機飛抵渝、到機塲歡迎者、有董顯光·杭立武·凌其翰·暨大使館參事柏美德等二十餘人、英大使下機後、與往迎者一一握手、笑容可掬、並頻間渝市被炸情形、倍表關切云、（三日電）</p>
<p>倫敦　關於駐華英大使寇爾爵士赴渝事、此間官方聲稱、早已預料大使將於九月初前往重慶、與中政府復獲接觸、大使此行、係其外交職務中之尋常行動云、（三日路透社電）</p>
<p>重慶　駐華英大使寇爾爵士本週初期抵此、華方人士對於英大使之使命、及將來之中英關係、揣測紛紜、官方人士對於因大使此來而發生之謠詠及和平傳說、切實加以否認、據稱、大使返渝、僅係例行之事耳云、當寇爾爵士今夏離渝赴滬時、曾聞渠將於歇夏後返渝、重與中政府接觸、故大使此次來渝、</p>
<p>未有政治意義</p>
<p>惟聞大使係應華當局之請、提早其離滬來渝日期、其故何在、則未宣布、華方人士今切欲見英大使返此、因彼等對現行英日協定、於十月間期滿後重行開放緬甸公路之問題、頗爲關切也、華方人士對緬甸公路重行開放之可能性、見解大相分歧、或信一俟協定期滿英國將重開此路、或信此路不致重開、而現行</p>
<p>協定或將展長</p>
<p>其信緬甸公路有重開可能者、舉理由如下（一）英國對日作此讓步多係美國不願於英國對日關係決裂時在遠東援助英國所致、近者美國禁運廢金屬與飛機汽油、成立美加聯防會、討論租借英屬海空軍根據地、在在表示美英更密切合作、及美國在遠東對日取更强硬之政策、（二）英國允封閉緬甸公路者、由於日本威脅法屬越南之故、法國崩潰而越南服從維希政府後、越南之地位今在協的國防務計劃中、乃處於</p>
<p>完全不同立塲矣、英國防務新加坡及其在遠東之利益其所依仗者爲中國而非越南、（三）英國切欲見中國强盛、能消減在中國境內之日軍中力、而使日本之物力人力竭蹶、否則日本所處地位能予德國對英作戰以積極之援助、（四）英國切欲對蘇聯維持密切友好關係、故英國在遠東之政策、不能與</p>
<p>蘇聯政策相悖</p>
<p>而蘇聯政策顯願中國强盛、並欲日軍在華窮於應付、不得脫身也、（五）英國協定係在其有史以來最危急之時、亦卽被侵危險迫於眉睫之日、今德國侵英之虞、益見遙遠、英國乃有餘暇以考慮其在世界其他部份之地位、同時英國日見强盛、今乃能對遠東大局予以更大注意、（六）英國邇來行動、如撤退香港婦孺、在英帝國各處逮捕日僑、及香港不准日船進口、以報復日人在廣州拘留英輪一事、皆司見英國已</p>

<h3>歐戰叢談（二）　少年希特勒的潦倒</h3>
<p>歐洲怪傑，號稱二十世紀拿破侖的德國元首希特勒，他的身世已約略爲世人所知。他自己還著了一本「我的奮鬥」，銷數很大。俗語說：「英雄不怕出身低」，往往一個人早年顚沛流離，經過非常艱苦奮鬥，後來創立驚動世界的功業；希特勒便是其中的佼俊者了。至於世人如何欽崇他，如何仇恨他，甚至如何咒駡他，那是另外一件事。總之，他吃盡千辛萬苦，方始造成了今日的地位，却是不可抹煞的。美國「星期六晚報」最近特約麥凱威（St．Clair　McKelway）寫了一篇「誰是希特勒？」從希特勒呱呱墮地，直述至上次歐戰終了後開始政治活動爲止，茲摘要節譯如次：</p>
<p>希特勒名亞多爾夫（Ado　If　Hitler），他的父親名叫亞羅斯·希克爾格羅柏·希特勒（Alois　Schicklgruber　Hitler），上世紀末住在奥國萊茵河畔伯勃諾鎭一所尖拱式窗戶的石屋中。他出身靴匠，以勤奮起家，四十歲時充任邊界關卡的一個小稅吏。每天穿着銅紐制服，一路從家裏出來，步行到辦公處，遇着熟人，執禮甚恭。農人們帶了田產物品，從巴伐利亞（在河之北岸，屬德）渡過萊茵河進入奥境的，都要在他手裏納稅。他小心謹愼的塡掣單據，忙得不了。這樣的生活過了若干年，便靠着養老金退休了。一</p>
<p>亞羅斯軀體肥碩，紅紅的圓臉，兩腿短勁，鐵灰色的頭髮，剪得很短，一撮刺蝟式的鬍髭，却不加修剪，聽其自然生長。他酷嗜杯中物，每天中午夜晚，總要飲上幾大杯啤酒；酒後和朋友們談笑風生，有怡然自得之樂。他在五十歲時，元配和繼配兩位夫人早已先後去世，遺下兒女數輩，他所娶的第一三位繼室，年紀祇及他一半，對這位年少美貌的太太，他自是喜悅。亞多爾夫希特勒就是這位夫人所生，可是幼童時代的希特勒對他父親並不十分熱絡，有時還要使他氣惱呢。</p>
<p>希特勒的父親對於這位「老來子」，從他出世的第一日起，就抱着莫大的愛悅之心，然而在亞多爾夫四歲的時候，他父親竟有些格格不入之感了。一天，星期日，希特勒的父親中飯時吃了些啤酒，覺得興緻勃勃。便把小亞多爾夫抱在臂灣，想把他搖摔作要，正在開始打轉的時候，亞多爾夫忽然大叫大哭起來，直至他母親前來把他放在地下，他還是大聲哭叫不已，兩個小拳頭擦着眼睛，從眼淚中旣恨帶懼的瞅着他的父親。亞羅斯最後把他抱在膝上逗着他，叫他從啤酒杯中啜飲些啤酒。他的哥哥等開始學走路的時候，都喜歡從父親的酒裏啜飲，所以他想如法泡製一番。可是亞多爾夫發癲似的儘管哭着，反而用他瘦削的小手去拍擊那酒杯。希特勒一雙手靑葱玉指，潔臼如脂，從小就像女太太們的柔荑</p>
<p>類於這種父子間不協調的事情，不一而足。亞多爾夫對他母親却非常親熱，他母親也因爲這孩子十分乖巧伶俐，也很鍾愛。他母親頎碩苗條，兩眼如大銀杏，金黃的頭髮，尤其美麗。亞多雨夫一日間最感愉快的時候，就是他坐在他母親膝上的片刻。其餘的時候，喜樂無常，甚至驚恐瑟縮，有些魂不守舍的樣子。他的眼睛，像他母親一樣，很大而且水汪在的。</p>
<p>希特勒十一歲那年，父子間竟然發生衝突了。「天下無不是的父母」，他父親希望兒子能承繼衣缽，置身仕路；也像他自己般穿着稅吏制服，領着官家俸祿，日後便是有個遷調，也可說得有個光榮的出身了。但是他的兒子執意不屑學他的父親，不以任政府官吏爲榮。這時候他堅決的態度格外的明顯起來。起初，他父親叫他讀書要用功，以爲日後爲公家服務的預備，可是亞多爾夫對他老子的訓總是不放在心上。後來索性　然表示反對，眼淚承睫，哭喪着臉，一千一百個表示不願意。</p>
<p>他父親喝着對他道：「那末，你究竟要怎樣呢？」</p>
<p>這孩子直率的回答。。「我願意做藝術家。」</p>
<p>「藝術家？畫師麼？呸！亞多爾夫，你眞在開玩笑了，對於正經事，還是不要開玩笑的好。「</p>
<p>其實希特勒對他父親倒並不在開玩笑，他一切都很明顯，的給他父親知道。還把幾張他們住宅的水彩速寫畫拿給他父親看，上面有一排十八世紀式的窗戶，和沿河岸的叢林，畫得也很美麗動人，但是這又於事何補呢。希特勒一再要求將來做個藝術家，結果他的父親總是不答應。</p>
<p>「我在世一日，決不許你做藝術家，」這是他父親斬釘截鐵的表示，父子之間從此積不相容。希特勒後來在「我的奮鬬」一書中，曾有下面的一段，紀叙當時的情形道：「我父親絕了我成爲藝術家的任何念頭。我表示在這種環境之下，是無法深造了。當然，這種表示的結果，徒使我獲得最不堪的反響，他老人家便對我種種壓迫起來了。我暫不作聲。我相信，當我父親看到我在學校中讀書不進步時，他便會屈從我的意向的。好在功課的不上進，已是毫無疑義。我祇把我以爲有利於將來做畫家的功課學習，其他，自以爲不重要，或不能引起興味的各種功課，祇好完全割愛了。」</p>
<p>然而希特勒的父親也不是易與的，對於兒子的這種抵抗辦法並不屈服。反之，碰到亞多爾夫校中成績報告不佳時，便毫不客氣的鞭笞立至了。十歲左右時的希特勒，雖是有些神經過敏，和纖巧的樣子，可是並不懦弱。他在學校中凡是自認爲不重要的功課，「一槪璧謝」。父親鞭責他的時候，他眼中淌着淚，竭力承受，憤恨之中夾着一種「決死之勇」的神氣。他心裏便開始輕視他的父親，和他父親的一切作爲。他決定將來不飲酒。</p>
<p>希特勒敬愛他的母親懇摯之至，眞自出自天性。在這處處與他爲難，像對他欲得而甘心的可怕世界中，祇有她一人是他所愛的。所以後來他看到任何女人，總先要想到他的母親；他的不能愛上任何婦女，也許就基於這個原因吧。他不喜歡與其他的孩子在一起玩，却歡喜一人獨處。他從小就有唯我獨尊的作風。</p>
<p>過了年把工夫，他父親吿老退休，靠着一些恩俸度日，舉家也遷到林資地方一個村中。亞多爾夫仍舊不喜歡讀書，他老子也毫不客氣的不時鞭責他。一九〇三年，亞多爾夫正足是十四歲，他父親突然去世。這時候這個孩子倒能隨心所欲，成爲藝術家了。</p>
<p>旣沒有父親的阻梗，希特勒的母親便徇從他愛子的意思，應允他長成之後，送他進維也納藝術學院。暫時則仍在學校裏混混。他在校時的成績，大致如下：品行甲等，注意力不均勻，德文，數學，物理學平平。後來，數學物理兩項略見進步，德文則仍如舊。幾何及圖案畫，起初很好，後來却退步了。素描畫起初「好」，到後來更「出色」。他的寫作總是不十分滿意，他沒有得到畢業文憑。求學時代的希特勒性情還是捉摸不定，哭叫無常，疏懶而不整飭，讀書喜歡東拉西扯，有一時期忽然醉心於有挿圖的普法戰爭史。他自居於德國英雄之列，深惜他的祖國奥地利軍事不及德國的强盛。像許多奥國人一樣，他願意自己是德國人或者把奧，匈，德，合併起來成一個大帝國。</p>
<p>這時候，他喜歡畫畫圖，但也是隨隨便便的，並不刻苦專心。一九〇七年十月，正十八歲，他初次要想進維也納藝術學院，帶了他平時的作品前去，學院當局看了看之後，並不叫他參予入學考試，第一次他失敗了。第二次他再去試，結果仍舊說他沒有繪畫的天才，無法造就。希特勒在「我的奮鬬「中曾記載當時的情形，他失望的情態，溢於字裏行間。他說，當時學院方面看了他的畫之後，認爲才具不足，說他的性情近於建築，問他爲什麼不進土木工程學校。其實這也是一種托辭而已。學院當局明知他習畫無望，只不過把建築來安慰他的心，搪塞搪塞罷了。亞多爾夫當時倒頗爲動心，很想入建築學校，但是據他自己說，卒因沒有預備學校的文憑，建築學校也沒有進得成功哩。</p>
<p>一九〇八年秋，他一事不做，和他母親住在一起，幾個月之後，慈母見背，從此亞多爾夫便孑然一身。可是從這時候起，他思想和行動方面，格外成就了保持他自我的偉大，和自尊的作風。他並不怨自己的坎坷，所深致不滿的却是他所託生的世界。希特勒之所以成爲希特勒便肇端於斯。</p>

<p>首飾金亦掛大十元</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出、初時大同行仍懸六百三十元、迫九時四十分掛大十元、此後則無變動、結果大同行改懸六百四十元、新同行與上價相仿、收進减低三十元光景、</p>
<h3>外匯後市　不小轉賣</h3>
<p>外匯昨日市况、匯豐掛脾、悉無上落、英美匯暗市、潛勢續緊、惟後市利空、流言頗熾、如越南將脫離貝當政府、又宋子文氏由美反渝將重仟財長之說、午盤初洋行粉麥結款需要甚殷、且投機商亦扒進近遠期美匯、價則軟化、英金亦一致帶緊、後市因上述消息遍播、投機商不少塞出、但中途缺少買戶、惟價並未見鬆、收盤結果、美匯重吿五元二一八七五、英金三辦士五一五六二五、較隔昨英美各縮〇三一二五與〇六五、期貨與現貨愈形接近、</p>
<p>洋行有粉麥結款</p>
<p>晨初以倫敦大條、近還均升〇六二五、紐約銀無市、匯兌英對美滬等一致未更、美對英滬等無市、因前日爲美國勞働紀念、各業休假、中央掛牌各匯如舊、銀行晨開現貨賣價、英金三辦士五四六八七五、美匯五元二八一二五、較之上日收市、英美兩滙均平、開後因洋行與粉麥結款、市面微軟、計外行有利等塞予洋行九月份英匯二八一二五及二五、又十月份美滙五元一八七五時現美滙最緊已告五元一二八七五、匯豐掛牌揭曉勿動、白銀平衡稅揭曉增百分之〇·五〇、此　市面略定、有利吸外行本月份美匯五元二五、惟不久華商投機家頓萌買意、入市結納近遠期美滙、價又轉軟、計美行有利售予華商投機家九月份美匯五元二一八七五、並十月份美匯五元一八七五、迄午收止、變化甚少、結果英金三辦士五四六八七五不動、美匯五元二一八七五、比晨開縮〇六二五、</p>
<p>投機商所進為出</p>
<p>午後謠言又興、傳越南政府將脫離貝當政府、並聞宋子文氏已由美返國、有重任財長之說、致經營者認爲消息利空、投機家遂來賣出、計先塞予華比本月份美匯五元二五、嗣投機家欲售已難覓對手、但不久浙江及上海等吃進同月　匯仍爲五元二五、且收盤結果英金仍三辦士五一五六二五、美滙五元一二八七五、十月份英金三辦士半、美滙五元一八七五、比上日英金現貨緊〇三一二五、美匯縮〇六二五、下月份英金軟〇一五六二五、美匯緊〇六二五、　香港美緊英不動香港三日（週二）電、今晨滙市開盤吿平、英滙現期貨仍吿不動、美匯現貨緊〇六二五、爲二十二元三一一五、申匯現貨升四元、爲四百二十四元、日滙現貨緊半元、爲九十四元半、十一時三十分吿平、各滙概無榮辱、延至下午二時三十分仍吿平平無變動、</p>

<h3>絲茶　生絲「特捐」行且再加　日商加緊繭統制　上海絲市勢將停閉</h3>
<p>戰後上海絲市、曾呈一度繁榮、蓋當時因某方集中注意力於無錫一帶、無暇及此而有以致之也、然自前年秋季以後、其對上海生絲原料、已由留難而至嚴格統制、是以上海絲商頗多遷至滬杭京滬綫開設小絲廠、藉以解決原料問題、然自今春始、內地小絲廠之成一品已不克自由運滬、而須由日一商設法以每擔三百元之代價包一運之、同時「蠶絲特捐局」亦吿成立、計生絲出運或出口每百斤須另繳一百十元、上海同業雖感內痛、但不得不從之、</p>
<p>昨據「特捐局」許某談、最近曾舉行會議，商討加捐辦法、與會者有滬絲繭業代表沈某等、據許某曰、最近將來、加捐勢必實行、白廠經每擔估價四千元、抽特捐四百八十元，土絲每擔估價二千元、抽特捐二百八十元、其計算率、卽月前盛傳之百分之十二云、當詢以何日實施、則云未能奉吿、亦未能事前宣佈云、（A）</p>
<p>邇來絲市、旣鮮升沉亦無交易、蓋自橫濱現貨市價被維持以來、投機家退出市塲、絲價已呈呆鈍、在本埠言、英法絲市已不能展開、日商洋行據云亦少吸購、探其原由、有云內地統制加緊、上海絲市均將停閉然筒中情形、或因自絲經可由日商包運以來、絲價已「太高昂」、爲更有利於統制計、自當來此一手、以扔低絲價也、　昨橫濱現貨一三五〇元、遠期一四二五元、紐約封關無市、</p>
<h3>證劵　內債午后重騰　再見新高價</h3>
<p>證券暗盤、昨市一度略小後、丙種會敲破三元關、午後突又起漲風、各種行市再見新高價、一日間市價高低相差一元之鉅、市况之活躍、復見從前正式之動態、市價之驟漲、蓋以昨日下午有數家代做之空頭、因故不得不補、致使市價突飛猛晋、丙種逼近五十四元、曾見五十三元九角行市、乙種突又穿出七元關、扶搖上騰、連接七日之久、環境並無足以刺激之消息、惟於市價劇漲後、乃有各種不同附會之謠言、旣無法證明、復不足取信、前途市價脚地雖堅、無如浮多過擁、恐因吐出而回鬆、但無正式跌風耳、昨日補空旣多、散戶買進亦不少、鴻大聯和買進最湧、同康聯益恒孚永昌及六號等均有買進、信孚恒康協大仁昌順昌永康均有賣出、上午丙種跌進三元關、下午丙種漲至三元九角、波動甚鉅、應稍起變化、市價結果、　漲四角半至七角、成交的計一百八十萬元、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>股票交易、成交華商電氣股一百股、價爲五元六角半、</p>
<p>又衆業公所、昨日股市、趨勢不定、價格波動極大、倐上倐下、有一點足資注意、每當價格被獲利了結或拋空者壓低時、新買戶即告絡繹、收盤時實業股趨勢較一日中最佳時爲軟、此或係受橡皮股影響、關於後者之矛盾謠言甚夥、晨初開盤軟極、嗣忽盛傳爪哇等地所頒新條例並不確實、市况立時轉堅、無如賣方胆怯、賡續出籠、價格終又回落、但低價下維持者亦不乏人、</p>
<p>倫敦二日（週一）電、今日中國外債及遠東英商各公司股票掛牌行市、祇英股微有上落、滙豐銀行股票升半鎊、英倫註冊股爲六十四鎊、香港註冊股爲六十九鎊、開平煤礦不記名股疲落一先令、價爲十五先令、其餘不動、</p>

<h3>紗花　投機再向　雙馬紗　出千元大關</h3>
<p>紗市續升、且漲風殊烈、此因外匯改縮、黃金昂騰、掀起投機買風、同時空方鑒於如斯情况、活動扒補、於是互相高抬允烈、但實際銷路、依然呆鈍而各方交通仍遭封閉、査雙馬價格、數日來已漲百元外、一味專恃熱烈人氣之扶持、客銷不來、存貨日增、將後之變遷、亦不可不防也、申新廠乘　開出一十支雙馬三四千包、價爲一千零三十元、每包收定洋百五十元、十月期、</p>
<p>現紗晨開、人氣尙屬和緩、二十支雙馬個爲九百九十元、微跌至九百八十七元、旋聞美匯改縮、投機買風及空頭抵補、相繼而來、檯面驟緊、直穿出至千元關外、至一千零十四元、因某康銀行及廣帮某多頭了結約計四五百包、一時籌碼又回挫至一千零零七元、須臾聞黃金大漲、市况由疲轉俏、漲至一千零二十元外、收盤價爲一千零十八元、漲二十三元、茲將各帮口買去之額量、分列如左、</p>

<h3>棉花交易　突然暢旺　惟同業投機居多</h3>
<p>現棉交易、驟然起色、此因疲弱已久、同時匯票縮風重現、致人心激昂、同業投機買賣隨時而起、惟廠方除日廠仍有採辦外、共他尙屬靜默而無生色也、茲將成交各棉價錄左、</p>

<p>奧姆拉　一八〇·〇〇　益豐進一〇〇件</p>
<p>另訊、外棉市價、紐約昨日爲勞工節、市塲停市一天、印度昨日連同預測亦無甚軒輊、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、日來頗見活躍、乃因市上存底不豐、故各方索價奇高、尤以長纖維者爲最、靑島帮之購意頗濃、整日向各方詢價索樣、殊甚忙碌、按照此種情况、棉價將繼續上漲也、</p>
<h3>疋頭　棉布囤戶　伺機而動</h3>
<p>布市一致堅昂、蓋以布價壓抑日久、囤戶伺機而動、昨紗價上漲有力、業內外擇廉漸起吸收、成交頗旺、售盤細布·細斜·漂染布每疋漲一角半至五角、粗布漲二角半之譜、本街成交各貨一千餘件、粵港幫辦色布·綫呢斜紋二百數十件、浙路溫台幫辦粗布·色布三百餘件、北路烟·津幫辦藍布，斜紋·絨粗布一百餘件、</p>

<h3>糧食　又傳海防封鎖　洋米再起漲風　粳米到貨多　售價仍難鬆</h3>
<p>米市昨以報載日艦封鎖海防之說人心復堅、一般實銷、迨恐市面再起劇烈變化、不約而同及早乘廉搜辦、一時買氣頓旺、引得搶帽皮球生意繼起逐鹿、懷貨者趁機居奇、喊聲在飛、各洋米價除高檔貨以技持於評價無能升縮略有應市外、其業已甩短之中段貨、頓見步步回騰元半光景、收盤一號西貢暹邏及大絞等仍站評綫外、二號西貢暹邏除浦東棧開五十八元半、其浦西棧又達五十九元、小絞亦然相仿、東京砶尖五十五六元、碎尖四十六元、米菉特四十九元半、次至四十八元半、原包則較好半元至近元而已、二號西貢英華司進口初開七十元，繼大至七十元〇五角、又暹邏進口米七十元及銀行七十元〇二三角、無兵險者則自六十九元至六十九元半、小絞開六十九元半、統計不足三百噸、現貨則有七千包之譜、</p>

<h3>現粉轉堅　阜豐廠減半供給</h3>
<p>麪粉　昨日現粉市面轉堅、因阜豐廠鑒於小麥原料不敷應用、對於本街供量、減爲半數、致市上老車牌現粉驟形减少、人心不免帶硬、洋粉及內地粉均鮮做開、而投機者注目之東粉鳳凰牌交易、因米價復昂、復趨活躍、現貨首先喊高、期粉亦緊五分至一角、計開本月份十四元五角、十月份十五元一角三分至角半、成交共有六七千包、</p>
<p>小麥　昨日交易、續趨　周、因虹口來源不多、貨方一味扳守、且最近出口幫略有收買、均由某方承辦、吃盤已抬二十五元、致華廠方面、收麥更多困難、雖放價亦乏整額而取、統市日廠續進崑山嘉定等麥二千餘包、價爲二十一元半至二十二元、市面漲跌兩難、</p>
<h3>油市　生豆油市　動盪劇烈</h3>
<p>昨日生豆油市况、一日間之波浪、動盪起伏殊劇烈、大局雖云到銷相埒、致引起人心、但市價漲跌倐忽、完全被踢皮球生意所左右、結果收盤潛勢仍居緊俏局面、統計做開大連豆油一百桶、價自九十九元至一百元、靑歧豆油五十件、價爲七十一元、烟歧豆油一百五十件、價爲七十二元、大有餘廠豆油八百餘担、價爲七十七元至七十七元五角、又成交膠州現生油一百件、價爲六十五元五角、訂九月上半月交一百件、價爲六十三元五角至六十四元、九月下交一千三百餘件、價爲六十三元至六十四元五角、十月上交五百五十件、價爲六十三元五角至六十四元五、十月下交六百件、價爲六十四元至六十四元五角、烟台現生油五十件、價爲六十五元五角、靑島現生油三百桶、價爲九十一元至九十三元五角云、</p>
<h3>糖市　粗白獨升</h3>
<p>昨日糖市因美元又緊關係、先漲數角、後因進戶實銷不佳、續漸回平、公會劃盤、二四粗白新貨七十八元二角、升七角、老貨七十六元五角、升五角、　嘜荷赤六十三元五角、六十三元四角、回至六十三元、KD嘜荷棉白七十三元六角、太古B嘜七十七元、DY嘜七十三元七角至七十三元五角、與上日比較相仿、又糖昨由嗬囒來八百噸、又由香港來七千四百包、</p>

<p>探捕防軍一律出動</p>
<p>法租界警務當局，於上月三十一日採取突然之戒備措置後、連日法國防軍及全體警捕、紛紛出動、在法租界各處進行搜查、並在各衝要地段、佈置障礙物、對車輛行人、予以</p>
<p>嚴密檢查</p>
<p>工作緊張、迄未稍弛、且在戒備措置之性質上、似有益趨嚴密之勢、該項戒備、迄仍以中區最爲緊張、法捕房巡捕每五六人爲一隊、在各馬路巡邏搜査、絡繹不絕、鐵甲車亦往來逡巡、頗形忙碌、在各公共汽車所經道路、亦不時有巡邏隊伺候、隨時</p>
<p>喝令停駛</p>
<p>予以嚴密檢查、此外、有最使人注目者、厥爲先前雖逢重要紀念日、亦不佈防之馬路如辣斐德路·呂班路·聖母院路·巨籟達路·貝諦鏖路·福煦路等數處、昨均已攔置鐵絲網、僅</p>
<p>留一缺口</p>
<p>並各分駐大　巡捕及法防軍、對來往者監視頗嚴、尙有其他中區之不重要道路口、兩旁亦預置鐵絲網架、以備隨時封鎖、情緒雖極緊張、但一般居民出入、尙無限制之處、</p>

<p>上海米糧評價委員會本規定參照米糧存數、到數、銷數、產價、等各項情况、評定各種米糧之最高市價、每一星期舉行二次、星期二五評定、三六實行、後因米市漸趨穩定、乃議决評價日期臨時決定、最近米市漲風復熾、該會卽恢復原有評價日期、昨日下午三時、該會卽假座愛多亞路十五號三樓再度會商、議決結果、除小絞洋米價格評小五角外、其餘各貨、卽維持上月卅日評定之價格、公吿市塲、今日實行、解案從略、至五時許始吿散會、</p>
<p>今日實行</p>
<p>該會昨日評定之洋米最高價格、業於今晨公吿市塲實行云、「茲經本委員會評定、自本月四日起、各種洋米每石之最高價格開列如左、一號西貢暹羅六十一元五角、火絞六十一元、二號西貢暹羅五十九元、小絞五十八元五角、高東京臼米五十六元、東京糙米五十二元、米茶五十元、混合碎四十六元、其由以英華書交易者、連兵險在內、最高價格如左、二號西暹羅七十一元、上列價格、務須切實遵守、市塲買賣、祗准在該項價格之下、不得超越逾限、如有暗盤等情事、一經察覺、卽當陳報兩租界當局嚴厲懲處、又査最近市竟超越西貢之上、殊屬非是、今後無論何種最高洋米、不得超越「號西貢之格、並希注意為要、特此公吿、」</p>
<p>巧立名目</p>
<p>新聲社記者昨向本市米業界探悉、一般米業投機奸商、莫不百般設計、企圖坐獲巨利、其居心誠不可測、自評價委員會准予寬放限價後、若輩認爲限價僅屬具文、爰市上買賣竟超越限價、除二號西貢·米茶·火絞尙有成交外·其他各貨竟無買賣、持貨者猶待高價出籠、糙米亦冒稱東京臼米、乃致超出限價、並另立名目所謂「安南粳」、宣稱質地較佳、開價竟達七十餘元一石、査安南粳僅屬變相、現市上無此項米類、投機米商竟狡獪至此、</p>
<p>禁止兼营</p>

<h3>買多頭空頭</h3>
<p>自從買多頭空頭之風一開，而倒帳乃日見，何則？吊盤之事，與賭無異，此賣若干，彼賣若干，僅以一言爲定，而其勝負之數，則有不可以自主者，以至身家之破敗但於斯，性命之喪失恒於斯，此官憲之所以必禁也。但禁則禁矣，錢莊家之作吊盤者，仍復私相授受，禁令愈嚴，而此風彌甚。在公所做行情之時，某莊買銀幾何，某莊買洋幾何，一經買定，或卽於晚間過帳，或卽於次日過帳，所謂現錢交易也，漸而掛其尾找，漸而短交幾許，積而久焉，仍與空盤無異，買者買，賣者賣，皆無現錢，數日之後，一結總帳，間有隔數期而結帳者，在彼以爲本係往來交易之家，卽無現錢進出，其實與現錢何異，而不知顯犯空盤之禁也。又有廣有貲財者，向市上逐日收取現洋現銀，積之於家而不用，彼以現買現，又誰得而禁之，而不知收之者日見其多，卽市上現洋日見其少，物稀爲貴，積之愈久，獲利愈豐，此雖不同於空盤，而實卽所謂壟斷也。</p>

<h3>生命是由我們創造的</h3>
<p>— O．S．Mardey著　羅門譯</p>
<p>你對於今天的成功覺得不滿意嗎？這是昨天種植的收穫。你夢想過黃余的將來嗎？今天你種植什麽，將來你就會收成什麽。我們在生命中下某種工夫，我們就能在生命中得到某種東西。</p>
<p>大自然感動我們的心境；她與笑者同笑而與淚者同淚。假使我們是喜悅與開心的話，那末鳥唱得更好聽，樹林與流水好似唱着我們的歌曲。但是假使我們是悲傷或煩惱的話，那末意外的黑暗籠罩了大自然的外貌；陽雖然照着，但是與我們毫無關心，鳥雖然唱着，但是並不是對我們唱的。</p>
<p>「將來」是隨着我們創造的，我們的意志能定牠的性質。一個人的決定就是一個人的預言。留下你的懦怯的悲觀在後面，不要預言惡的，而是好的。有希望的人們總是在前面的。</p>
<h3>在票房裏</h3>
<p>— 新良</p>
<p>由於一個朋友的介紹，我得到了一個很明顯的，「票房」的縮影。</p>
<p>走進了大鬥，又跨過兩層樓梯，朋友對我說道：「這裏就是我學唱戲的地方了。」</p>
<p>房間並不大，由於擁擠在裏面的人數的衆多，地位是顯得更加狹窄了。裏面的人，有立着的，有斜倚在沙發裏的，有正在抽着香燜的，也有正在咬着西瓜子的……他們的態度都是非常的寬弛，鬆散，一點兒沒有緊張的神情，可以被旁人抓到。</p>
<p>我剛跨進門口，就聽到一陣觸耳的，如雷一般的掌聲，同時，聽得還有人在叫着：「李小姐，眞是天賦的歌喉，唱得活像是梅派的傳人哩！」我頓時注意到：李小姐是一個年的二十歲的姑娘，面孔生得挺漂亮，身材也挺苗條，何况頭上還燙着最摩登的髮型，身上的旗袍也有最新式的，手上還戴有一只獨粒頭的金鋼鑽戒……把她打扮得簡直是個天仙化人呢！</p>
<p>接着，尖銳的胡琴聲又起來，這是輪到王大頭吊「借東風」了，那個茶房就連忙把預先泡好在綠色的一把小茶壺裏的開水挪了過去，放在王大頭身邊的那張桌子上。</p>
<p>我對於京戲完全是一個門外漢，所以朋友又帶我在房子四周走了一圈，我看見：牆壁上掛的儘是一張張戲照，生旦凈丑，各種都有，之外，還有許多臉譜，紅的，黑的，白的，與綠色的粉壁相映着，的是有趣，在一個牆角落裏，又堆積有鑼，鈸，鼓，簫，……等等的樂器，間雜有馬鞭，長槍，大刀，次序是相當亂的。</p>
<p>最後，我們來到了一張四方的桌子邊，朋友吿訴我：「那個老的，胖胖的，就是我們這裏敎花旦的敎師。」在他的周圍，我看見有無數的人在挨着腔，拍着板，每一個人的腦經裏大概都在憧憬着日後上台的風頭吧。我想。</p>
<p>在這裏，我們聽不到一句嘆苦的，悲慘的聲音，射入我眼簾的，印入我心坎中最深的影象，就是一種所謂「歌舞昇平」的氣概。反正到這裏來的，大概都是富家的子弟，你只要教我唱戲，任何犧牲都可以</p>
<p>他們都是此時此地最幸福的人兒啦，我羨慕着。</p>
<p>霍桑探案</p>
<h3>舞后的歸宿</h3>
<p>— 程小青著</p>
<p>第六章　危險的經歷</p>
<p>霍桑點點頭：「你的記億力倒還沒有隨着年齡而衰退。開槍的就是這個人。」</p>
<p>倪金壽問道：「你可認識這個人？」　雷桑縐着眉峯，「不，我簡直不曾看見他的正面。我的失敗的考語，就指這一點。……唉！太謹愼眞會壞事。」他隨手把烟尾丟在烟盔盆裏。我說道：「喂！你說下去啊。開槍以後怎麽樣？」霍桑道：「那就要說到巧的第二點了。這一點你也可以將功抵罪，那電話間的玻璃門下半截是木板的，因爲那門開着，我的身子雖然蹲倒，仍瞧得見開槍人的一部分。我見那人旋轉身子，向着那南面的大門走出去，脚步很從容，分明是個老手。我連忙也站起來，把電話簡擱好，用白巾掩着面颊，从电话间裏走出来。这时，我已将大衣卸下，挟在左腋间。我走出电话间以後，早已有幾个閒人和那旅館裏的職員攏來。我隨便敷衍着，聲稱自己投醫院去。那旅館職員分明也爲着怕事，讓我從前門走出去、</p>
<p>「這時前門口出進的人不少。我走到鬥口，曾把手巾掩着臉，向左右瞭望，看見那人正在右首轉角上走上汽車。那汽車恰巧停在我的汽車的後面。他以爲我已中槍，故而態度上絕對從容，更不防我會尾隨他出去。因着他的從容，門口雖有不少人因槍聲而驚異，也絕不懷疑到他。我的態度自然也須保持從容，等到他的汽車開動以後，我才放開脚步，走到我的汽車面前，開了車門跳上去。我的汽車開動的時候，前面那輛汽車已駛得相當遠，但沒有脫離我的視綫的限度。那是一輛綠色汽車！</p>
<p>倪金壽忽舉起了一隻手，表示他要揷一句話。「是出差汽車嗎？」</p>
<p>霍桑點點頭。「是的，是强生公司的車子，號碼是八〇八四四。」</p>
<p>「那容易了。我們立刻可以查明白。」倪金壽說時，又在他的記事册上寫了幾筆。</p>
<h3>金鈴子</h3>
<p>— 恭儀</p>
<p>在靜寂的夜里，忽然聽到一種唧喞的虫聲從隔壁房里送來，那是我們鄉下冬靑樹上的秋虫，叫做金鈴子。</p>
<p>上海土貴如金，缺少空曠之地，更少花木，這種我們習見的小虫，也就像中秋月餅那樣作爲一種應時品的。這幾天，有挑着這種小虫的担子在各處弄里發現，就是他們特地到鄉下去捕捉來後，作爲一種應時買賣的。</p>
<p>據說人類是愛好動物的，一隻貓生下地來，就喂以牛乳，讓牠在溫暖的臥室里生長；一頭雄健的狗，也必鎖以鐵鏈，要牠作紳士式的散步；甚至在海洋中過生活的魚類，也使牠晚離驚駭的浪潮，而裝入電氣的玻璃缸中；這些秋季的小虫，自然也一視同仁，從翠綠色的樹上關進了狹小的玻璃匣內了。</p>
<p>然而愛好的結果，使那生大起來的小貓失去了捕捉了老鼠的本能，如果一天沒有上好的貓飯，就有餓死的危臉；一頭雄健的狗也至多在門口嗅嗅來客的脚尖；熱帶魚死亡率之高，假如有統計的話，一定很可觀的；那末今夜在得意地振翅而鳴的金鈴子，怎不會就是牠生命的最後一剎那呢？</p>
<p>可是這愛好的虐待，也有着必然的原因的：譬如貓和狗，本來有着天賦的責任的，一躺到溫暖的懷抱里，及紳士式地裝腔作勢，自然變了玩物了。至於熱帶魚與金鈴子之類，更以僅僅的美色和聲音來取悅於人，於是不但是玩物，而是剎那間的應時玩物了。</p>
<h3>「登革熱」</h3>
<p>松江近來流行着一種極少見的傳染病，鬧得滿城風雨，十室九病，醫生應接不暇，這就是登革熱（Dengne）。按本症的認識，已百五十年。在埃及和小亞細亞地方，差不多每夏流行。一九二八年希臘曾大流行一次，患者達二萬萬人之多。病涼尙未明瞭，大的係一種濾過性病原體，由黃熱蚊（Stegomgia　Calopus）媒介傳佈。潛伏期五六日，多數有一二天的前驅期，突發高熱至三十九度以上，四肢關節腰背等處酸痛異常，轉動困難，一二日後熱稍退，三四日後再高而發紅疹，六七天熱降疹退而遺留長時期的衰弱或失眠。但亦有合併嘔吐，昏迷，腎炎，肺炎等。居民被染的達百分之八九十，而死亡率極低。卽有合併症祇千分之一二，吾則絕少死亡。治療無特效，惟當注意滅蛟耳。柯德瓊醫師</p>
<h3>耶穌基督的勇敢（二）</h3>
<p>（三）反對當時社會和宗敎的階級觀念：當耶穌的時代，猶太國的社會和宗敎都有一種牢不可破，很深刻的階級觀念，好像印度一樣，十分的不平等。耶穌以爲人類雖有智愚賢不肖的不同，但其人格却是平等，不當歧視，所以他極力要打破這種階級觀念，與當時被人看爲罪人的往來，接待他們，和他們同席喫喝。有人質問他的門徒說二「你們的先生爲甚麼和稅吏並罪人「同喫飯呢」耶穌聽見就說「康健的人用不着醫生，有病的纔用得著…我來本不是召義人，乃是召罪人」。（馬太九11　13）</p>
<p>（四）在危險環境中的鎭定：一個人在危險的環境中，仍能安如泰山，置生死於度外，這種鎭定的精神，也足顯其勇敢。有一次耶穌和他的門徒乘船渡海，『海裏忽然起了暴風，甚至船被波浪掩蓋，耶穌却睡着了，門徒叫醒了他說，主阿，救我們，我們喪侖啦!耶穌說，你們這小信的人哪，爲甚麽膽怯呢？於是起來，斥責風和海，風和海就大大的平靜了』。（馬太八23）</p>
<p>因爲耶穌有這樣的勇敢，所以兩千年來的基督敎，都是繼續他這種精神，與罪惡奮鬥。親愛的讀者！你覺得有時要忠實於眞理而瞻前顧後，畏縮不前嗎？你發覺了人的僞善雖然義憤塡膺，却是敢怒而不敢言嗎？猶太人有階級觀念，我國人未必沒有，你敢從你自身嘗試着打破嗎？你在極度危險的環境中，覺得張皇失措，不能力持鎭靜，從容應付嗎？你如果承認，便是你的弱點，不够勇敢，應當赶緊投靠我們的救主耶穌基督，祂能加添你的力量。</p>

<h3>新秋喜訉　費文麗重作新娘　與勞侖斯奥立佛　在加州舉行婚禮</h3>
<p>— 新影</p>
<p>爲了「亂世佳人」的成功，　目前英籍新　費文麗，在好萊塢已紅得發紫。據八月三十日加州的電傳，這一顆美貌女星，已和英籍男星勞侖斯奧立佛，正式結婚了。這裏，筆者要把費文麗的婚史和這一次舉行婚禮的情形，吿訴讀者：</p>
<p>前夫小誌</p>
<p>早年時代，費文麗爲了愛好戲劇，在倫敦一個戲劇學校裏專攻戲劇一科。就在那時節，在社交塲中，和一個靑年律師萊霍爾門（Leigh　Holman）彼此一見傾心，發生了戀愛，種下了情根，什麽都順利的進行。終於到十九歲的一年，他倆是結婚了。婚後夫婦倆的感情也是很好，費文麗的名字本來叫費文瑪莉哈脫萊，爲了丈夫的名字中有個L　eigh字，所以她婚後就把夫婦倆名字的第一個字截下來，取名費文麗。當初他們倆愛好的情形卽此也可見一斑了吧！</p>
<p>婚變經過</p>
<p>的確，他們結婚之後，他很愛她，她也愛他。曾經誕生過一個愛女，叫莎賽妮霍爾門，今年已六歲了。可是好景不常，當費文麗在英國拍戲的時候，和勞侖斯奧立佛同隸一家影片公司，彼此因爲職業關係，時常接觸，便發生了愛苗。同時，她和那靑年律師的愛情，也就不能維持下去，終於破裂了。一方面和前夫離婚，另方面和後夫訂婚，她的羅曼斯是不斷的打影城中傳播出來。</p>
<p>婚慶簡單</p>
<p>八月三十日那天的晚上。費文麗終於在南加州勞侖斯奧立佛的一個朋友家裏結婚了。婚禮的進行很是簡單，賀客也祇有很少的幾個，因爲他們事前沒有把這喜訊洩露。那天晚上，女明星凱絲玲赫本和好萊塢名導演卡遜凱寗剛人，是特地去參加婚禮的。結過了婚，第二天早上，一雙新夫婦就到加州北部去作蜜月旅行。有情人終成眷屬，好萊塢的人們，都在羨慕勞侖斯奧立佛的艷福呢！</p>

<h3>彈詞二十種（十九）　落霞孤鶩</h3>
<p>— 凍雲　岫烟</p>
<p>落霞孤鶩——近人新編的彈詞，和「啼笑姻緣」「滿江紅」形成三位一體。</p>
<p>江秋鶩和落霞，一個是小學敎員，一個是使女。全劇展開時，天正下着大雪，落霞啣主人命上市購菜，不意買菜的錢給人搶了去；懾於主婦嚴威，不敢空手復命！幸得江秋鹜解囊相助，救了落霞。落霞感恩知己，於是鍾情於秋鶩。但秋鶩却一往情深於另一個姑娘是一個濟良所裏的女郞馮玉如後來有一個機會，讓落霞報了秋鶩的恩：她自己獲罪於主人，也送進了濟良所。</p>
<p>因着這種種的變化，演成了纏綿悱惻嫌人眼淚的故事。</p>

<h3>閒話湞陸根榮</h3>
<p>禿髮，蒼老，又愚蠢!</p>
<p>這是一個畸形的現象。</p>
<p>本來，皮黃劇是表現歷史劇，影戲則是反映時代的。如今，電影製片商們都在從事攝製古裝影戲,皮黃劇反而在搬演近代現實的資料，大舞台旣演「閻瑞生王蓮英」於前，共舞台也跟着排演「黃慧如陸根榮」了。</p>
<p>這次共舞台排演「黃慧如陸根榮，」共有二個特點，一個是聘請金素雯担任黃慧如一角，一個是眞陸根榮上台。我們知道，金素雯的思想，向來異於一般皮黃劇從業員，她是比較具有淸醒的頭腦者，所以在她主演黃慧如，正是恰到好處，因為黃慧如在劇中就是要從封建的舊制度裏，解放一條自由的生路者。至於眞陸根榮上台，無非增强號召力罷了，出塲時間很遲，是在巡警捕獲陸根榮一段裏，跑出來向觀衆鞠了一個躬，說了「我是眞陸根榮，十二年前已經不堪回首，現在是在做生意……」幾句話就完了。</p>
<p>爲了好奇心，特到　台與這個所謂眞陸根榮去會見一面，他的臉色很是蒼黑，頭髮大半禿了的，穿了一套法蘭絨的洋裝，說到美點，簡直十分之一都沒有，人是又很愚蠢，並不如劇中趙如泉所演的擅長口才者。</p>
<p>他說：今年已經三十三歲了，自從牢獄中出來後，曾經一度做過聖愛娜舞廳的僕歐，現在是在法租界擺了二個修理套鞋的小攤子，生活是並不怎樣的寬裕。</p>
<p>最後，記者問他黃慧如到底還在人世嗎？他却除了答覆皇家中人都已逝世，沒有確實的回答。後來又問他對於本劇的表演有何感想？他却愚蠢地用着莫名的笑聲來答覆了。</p>
<h3>另外一欄　在快樂的時候　你爲什麽要笑？</h3>
<p>— 蘭逸</p>
<p>這個問題多難呀，多奧妙呀！我假使回答你說：「你笑因爲。「是天生會笑的。」你能滿意嗎？</p>
<p>這個回答，雖然你未必以爲對，然而却是眞實的答覆。笑的現象是憑着你們的腦子和身體怎樣的構造而定的。你假使被人呵癢的時候，雖然你不快樂，但是你究竟不能不笑。要解釋這個就比較容易了，假使有一道强烈的光，忽然射到你眼珠，你就立刻把眼睛閉了起來，這也是因爲你的腦子，是這樣的構造，而要敎你這樣閉眼的。用這樣的理論去回答，確是一個簡妙的法子；你被人呵癢的時候要笑，也是一樣的道理。不過一個是你祗微一件事情，一個是你却伺時做了許多事情吧了。在見光的時候，不過動那眼臉的筋肉；笑則並且動你的呼吸用的筋肉，還要動你發笑的筋肉；它是道許多筋肉動在一起的一種特別動作。而且這個正就是呵癢的反應舉動，就像你的脚底被人搔了，你就要把脚縮開一般。</p>

<h3>Final Ultimatum to Japan Rejected by Vietnam; Japan Demands Passage of Troops Through Vietnam; French Official Agrees to Landing of Japanese Aircraft in Hanoi</h3>
<p>Saigon: An official gazette declares that Japan presented an ultimatum on Sunday, demanding passage of troops through Vietnam. This ultimatum has been rejected by the Vietnamese authorities. (Reuters dispatch, 3rd)</p>
<p>Tokyo: This morning, the Nichinichi Shimbun reported that Japan and France have reached an agreement allowing Japanese aircraft flying from Taiwan to Bangkok to land in Hanoi. This agreement was not negotiated with the Vichy government but was agreed upon with French officials stationed in Saigon. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 3rd)</p>
<p>Manila: The Vietnamese authorities are now strictly inspecting all incoming and outgoing wireless communications and telegrams. Telegrams sent by the press to Hanoi inquiring about news have also been returned undelivered. It is reported that telegraph agencies have received notification that the inspection committee will not allow the transmission of such news. However, private telegrams were allowed to arrive here today, indicating that the situation in Hanoi is very tense. (Associated Press dispatch, 3rd)</p>
<p>Tokyo: Japanese newspapers today continue to publish news of riots in Vietnam and warn that if such riots against the German-controlled Vichy government expand, Japan will be "extremely concerned." The Asahi Shimbun's Hong Kong dispatch states that the Vichy government is "urgently trying to maintain the integrity of Vietnam." The dispatch says that the French Vichy government has telegraphed the French garrison in Vietnam and the French fleet in the Far East, requesting them to "make efforts to suppress the riots" to show loyalty to the motherland. It is reported that the Vichy government has also requested the German-Italian Armistice Commission to take emergency measures to "maintain the peace and order of Vietnam." The Asahi Shimbun stated in an editorial, "The details of the current riots in Vietnam are not yet known, but if the rioters are supporting the Tegol regime, Japan will have to pay close attention, because Tegol is merely a puppet of the British government." In discussing the reported pledges of allegiance to Tegol by New Caledonia and New Hebrides, the newspaper stated that Japan "should not relax its surveillance of them," and added, "When we think of the importance of doubling air power, Japan should look far into the Pacific." (Associated Press dispatch, 3rd)</p>
<h3>Reasons for Dismissal of Former Governor-General of Vietnam</h3>
<p>Vichy: A foreign wireless station reports that General Catroux, the former Governor-General of French Indochina, was dismissed by government order for resisting compliance with the Franco-German armistice conditions. According to an official announcement here, General Catroux failed to fulfill the duties of a military man and colonial leader and pursued personal policies that hindered the protection of French interests in Vietnam. Therefore, the government ordered his dismissal on July 26. (Havas dispatch, 2nd)</p>

The reinforcements from the north were also completely repelled, and many spoils of war were captured. On the same day, another unit attacked various strongholds between Wangdu and Dingxian, thoroughly destroying the Tanghe railway bridge. Hundreds of Japanese troops were killed by the Chinese forces at various locations. (2) On the evening of the 21st, Chinese forces captured Caohezhen, and the Caohe railway bridge was blown up by Chinese forces. At the same time, sections of the highways from Yaocun (south of Yizhou) to Gucheng, and from Xiecun to Yaocun, were destroyed. Bridges and telegraph lines were burned by Chinese forces. (2nd dispatch)</p>
<p>Japanese Troops at Nama Market Fail to Attack Xinxu</p>
<p>Liuzhou: Japanese troops at Nama Market in the Nanning area attacked Xinxu on the morning of the 28th. They were intercepted by Chinese forces at Naqicun (west of Xinxu). After a fierce battle until noon, the Japanese were defeated and retreated along their original route. (2nd dispatch)</p>
<p>Liuzhou: On the evening of the 28th, Japanese troops near Suilu attempted to aid Wangkang, southwest of Shangsi, via Gongping, but were immediately repelled by Chinese forces. On the morning of the 29th, another unit of Japanese troops harassed Kongtuo and Wangling (both near Wangkang) and were also defeated by Chinese forces. (3rd dispatch)</p>
<p>Chinese Forces in Eastern Shandong Attack Liujiaxiahe</p>

<p>Chongqing: This year's winter clothing drive has been actively promoted by the National Winter Clothing Drive Committee, and various provinces and cities across the country have responded enthusiastically. It is expected that this year's results will be considerable. It has been learned that the Executive Yuan, in view of past shortcomings in the handling of winter clothing drives in various localities, is paying close attention to this year's plan and has approved three principles, which have been issued to the National Winter Clothing Drive Committee for compliance and disseminated to provincial and municipal governments for information. The three principles are as follows: (1) The National Winter Clothing Drive Committee will continue to launch the winter clothing drive this year to comfort the soldiers at the front and relieve the suffering compatriots, which is feasible. However, in accordance with Article 2 of the "Unified Collection of Donations and Contributions Measures," all winter clothing donations, both domestic and foreign, shall be collected uniformly by the Ministry of Finance or an agency entrusted by the Ministry of Finance. (2) The winter clothing donations shall be transferred by the Ministry of Finance to the Ministry of Military Affairs for the production of winter clothing and distribution to the soldiers at the front. (3) The fundraising methods proposed by the General Committee in the fundraising plan are too complicated and prone to abuse, and must be effectively corrected. (3rd dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing: Chen Jie, the ambassador to Germany, remitted 1,000 yuan in national currency from Berlin to be used as a winter clothing donation. (3rd dispatch)</p>
<h3>Hong Kong Trade Shows Marked Improvement</h3>
<p>Hong Kong: Hong Kong's trade report for July this year shows a marked improvement. Imports totaled HK$56,600,000, an increase of 11.9% compared to the same month last year. Exports totaled HK$62,400,000, an increase of 36.5% compared to the same month last year. Imports for the first seven months of this year totaled HK$478,200,000, an increase of 35.4% compared to the same period last year. Exports totaled HK$315,700,000, an increase of 42% compared to the same period last year. Unfortunately, food prices have risen sharply, increasing by 50% last year and another 25% since June. This is largely due to the reduced imports from nearby areas due to the Sino-Japanese War. For example, imports of poultry totaled 356,158 heads in July last year, but only 50,296 heads in July this year. This is not due to a decrease in consumption in Hong Kong, but because it is difficult to purchase from nearby areas. (Reuters dispatch, 3rd)</p>
<h3>Three Waves of Japanese Aircraft Attack Northern Sichuan, Dropping Incendiary Bombs Causing Major Fires; Did Not Invade the Airspace of Chongqing City</h3>
<p>Chongqing: Just after noon today, four waves of Japanese aircraft, totaling 108 planes, bombed various cities in northern Sichuan. Although details are not yet available, it is reported that Guang'an, north of Chongqing, was subjected to a fierce bombing by 48 Japanese aircraft, dropping many incendiary bombs and causing major fires. It is also reported that 18 Japanese aircraft attacked Batang, located on the highway between southern Sichuan and the border of Sichuan and Hubei. An alert was issued here at 11:00 AM when Japanese aircraft were spotted entering Sichuan territory. An hour later, four squadrons of Japanese aircraft flew towards Hechuan on the Jialing River, circling over the area for a long time. It was difficult to determine whether they would attack Chongqing. Soon after, the Japanese aircraft dispersed and did not continue south towards Chongqing, but flew towards various cities in northern Sichuan. At 1:30 PM, it was observed that the Japanese aircraft had returned to their base, and the alert was lifted here. A Japanese reconnaissance plane appeared over Chongqing this morning, hinting that Chongqing may soon be bombed again. Chinese fighter planes took off to intercept, and the Japanese aircraft all escaped eastward. (Reuters dispatch, 3rd)</p>
<p>Chongqing: 126 Japanese aircraft attacked Sichuan from Hubei in three waves on the 3rd, dropping bombs in Nanchong, Guang'an, and other places.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Two Questions About the Vietnam Issue</h3>
<p>Up to now, the Vietnam issue has been a problem for more than two months. Centered on this issue, there are bound to be two heavy questions in everyone's mind: (1) Japan has long been clamoring to attack Vietnam, but it has not been implemented. So, will she really attack Vietnam? (2) The news a few days ago said that the French Vichy government had succumbed, but according to the news in the past few days, it can be proved that the statement of submission is unreliable. Then, will it succumb to Japan's demands in the future?</p>
<p>First, will Japan really attack Vietnam? The simple answer is: in principle, it is absolutely impossible; but there may be exceptions. Japan's traditional foreign expansion policy has always had two factions: the "Southern Advance" and the "Northern Advance". The main supporters of the former are the Navy; while the most ardent advocates of the latter are the Army. These two factions compete with each other for dominance, and their power is equal. However, in 1937, the Army faction finally launched a war of aggression against China, which shows that the power of the "Northern Advance" faction has temporarily overwhelmed the Navy faction that advocates "Southern Advance." Under this situation, the Japanese Navy blockades the long coastline of China on one hand and takes an extremely vigilant attitude toward Britain and the United States on the other, adopting a defensive posture. So, for the past three years, Japan has indeed mobilized all of its land, sea, and air forces to concentrate on fighting a life-and-death battle with China. Therefore, as long as the Sino-Japanese war does not end one day, Japan's so-called "Southern Advance" is just a theoretical term. Aside from the fleet blockading China and being vigilant against Britain and the United States, where can it spare part of the Navy to take the risk of other naval wars? The comparison of power is originally relative. As a result of three years of bloody battle, Japan's overall national strength has been greatly reduced. In terms of international power contrast, it has long lost the qualifications to invade any other countries that can resist considerably. In the massive consumption of the war against China, how can Japan prepare the necessary raw materials, funds, and manpower to supplement and sustain the invasion of a third country? Therefore, no matter how envious Japan is of the great opportunity to advance southward during the ongoing European war, and no matter how loud the Southern Advance tune of the Konoe Cabinet is; however, since Japan cannot immediately wake up, give up the invasion of China, and withdraw from Chinese territory, then turning to advance into the South Seas is in fact impossible. The current attempt on Vietnam, apart from obtaining a base to attack Yunnan and Guangxi in China as the only means to achieve its goals, is only to threaten and force, hoping that the Vietnamese authorities will succumb.</p>
<p>In general, we are confident that our previous argument is correct, but there is one point that we have to specifically state: that is, the Japanese nation is a nation rich in emotional impulses, with a narrow-mindedness, and does not tolerate dissent. Therefore, when they are helpless, they often use tragic actions to deal with everything; whenever the country is in a dilemma, they often take tragic actions, regardless of success or failure, and act as they wish; it should not be unexpected to fire on Vietnam.</p>
<p>Second, will the French Vichy government succumb to all of Japan's coercion? This is the current question. Considering the attitude of the Vichy government, it is not enough to infer everything. However, after twice replacing the Governor-General of Vietnam, it can be generally regarded as having a great decisive effect. The previous Governors-General of Vietnam maintained their independent actions, that is, resisted the orders of the Petain government. Japan could then claim to take various actions only against Vietnam. Now that the original Governor-General of Vietnam has been replaced by the Petain government, the new Governor-General obviously accepts the political orders under the leadership of Petain, and it is conceivable the attitude of Vietnam in the future. Therefore, the negotiations between France and Japan today are on one side Japan, while the other side is no less than Germany and Italy. In the current international situation, since Japan does not have the courage to conflict with Germany and Italy, it can be said that it is fundamentally impossible for Japan to oppress Vietnam to submission. Therefore, the only way for Japan to achieve its goals is to appeal to the goodwill of Germany and Italy, and let them persuade or oppress the French Vichy government to accept Japan's demands. However, there is a major premise: Japan must cooperate with Germany and Italy, and take concrete actions to deal with Britain in the East, and attract more of Britain's naval fleet; it is of no use to simply arrest a few British overseas Chinese, or hold a few anti-British demonstrations in Japan and the occupied areas of China!</p>
<p>Therefore, the Vietnam issue is actually the most effective touchstone for Germany regarding Japan; testing what kind of determination, power, and effect he has to deal with Britain? In other words: the core of the current problem is whether Japan will accept Germany's proposal, not whether the French Vichy government will succumb to Japan's demands.</p>
<h3>British Ambassador Arrives in Chongqing by Plane; Chinese Are Concerned About the Yunnan-Burma Road Issue; Opinions Differ on the Possibility of Reopening</h3>
<p>Chongqing: British Ambassador Sir Archibald Clark Kerr arrived in Chongqing by China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) plane from Hong Kong at 7:30 AM on the 3rd. Those who welcomed him at the airport included Dong XianGuang, Hang Liwu, Ling Qihan, and Counselor Bermingham of the Embassy, ​​and more than 20 other people. After the British Ambassador got off the plane, he shook hands with those who welcomed him one by one, with a smiling face, and frequently asked about the bombing situation in Chongqing, expressing great concern. (3rd dispatch)</p>
<p>London: Regarding the British Ambassador to China, Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, going to Chongqing, officials here stated that it had long been expected that the Ambassador would go to Chongqing in early September to resume contact with the Chinese government. The Ambassador's trip is a normal action in his diplomatic duties. (Reuters dispatch, 3rd)</p>
<p>Chongqing: Since the British Ambassador to China, Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, arrived here in the early part of this week, Chinese personnel have speculated on the mission of the British Ambassador and the future Sino-British relations. Government officials have firmly denied the rumors and peace talks arising from the Ambassador's visit, saying that the Ambassador's return to Chongqing is merely a routine matter. It was heard that when Sir Archibald Clark Kerr left Chongqing for Shanghai this summer, he would return to Chongqing after summer vacation and re-contact the Chinese government. Therefore, the Ambassador's visit to Chongqing this time</p>
<p>Has No Political Significance</p>
<p>However, it is heard that the Ambassador accelerated his departure from Shanghai to Chongqing at the request of the Chinese authorities. The reason for this has not been announced. Chinese personnel are now eager to see the British Ambassador return here, because they are quite concerned about the issue of reopening the Burma Road after the current Anglo-Japanese Agreement expires in October. Chinese personnel's views on the possibility of reopening the Burma Road are quite divided. Some believe that Britain will reopen this road once the agreement expires, while others believe that this road will not be reopened, and the current</p>
<p>Agreement May Be Extended</p>
<p>Those who believe that the Burma Road may be reopened cite the following reasons: (1) Britain's concession to Japan was mostly due to the United States' unwillingness to aid Britain in the Far East if Britain-Japan relations broke down. Recently, the United States banned the export of scrap metal and aviation gasoline, established the US-Canada Joint Defense Council, and discussed leasing British-owned sea and air force bases, all of which show closer cooperation between the US and Britain, and a stronger US policy toward Japan in the Far East. (2) Britain agreed to close the Burma Road because of the Japanese threat to French Indochina. After the collapse of France and the submission of Vietnam to the Vichy government, the position of Vietnam is now in the allied defense plan, which is in</p>
<p>A Completely Different Position. What Britain's defense, Singapore and its interests in the Far East rely on is China, not Vietnam. (3) Britain is eager to see China strong, which can reduce the Japanese military force in China and exhaust Japan's material and human resources. Otherwise, Japan's position can provide Germany with positive assistance in the war against Britain. (4) Britain is eager to maintain close and friendly relations with the Soviet Union, so Britain's policy in the Far East cannot be</p>
<p>Contrary To Soviet Policy</p>
<p>And the Soviet policy obviously wants China to be strong, and wants the Japanese army to be exhausted in China and unable to escape. (5) The British agreement was made at the most critical time in its history, that is, when the danger of invasion was imminent. Now the danger of Germany invading Britain is becoming increasingly remote, and Britain has more time to consider its position in other parts of the world. At the same time, Britain is becoming increasingly strong, and it can now pay greater attention to the overall situation in the Far East. (6) Britain's recent actions, such as evacuating women and children from Hong Kong, arresting Japanese overseas Chinese in various parts of the British Empire, and Hong Kong banning Japanese ships from importing goods to retaliate against the Japanese detention of British ships in Guangzhou, all show that Britain has</p>
<p>Abandoned Its Policy Of Compromise, And Is Preparing To Fight To The Death When Japan Forces It. (7) It is rumored that Britain may allow gasoline to be imported to transport medical supplies to China via the Burma Road. However, some more pessimistic people believe that Britain will continue its policy of compromise when it is engaged in a life-and-death struggle in Europe and its military strength in the Far East is insufficient to fight against Japan. However, in any case, one thing is certain: if the Burma Road continues to be closed after the current agreement expires, then Chinese personnel's reaction to Britain will be very strong. People here generally believe that no matter what decision Britain makes, the British Ambassador's stay in Chongqing during this important period of Sino-British relations is of great importance.

<h3>Communist Leaders Holding Important Positions Is Untrue</h3>
<p>Chongqing: The rumor that communist members or left-wing leaders are currently holding important government positions is untrue. In reality, apart from Zhou Enlai serving as the Deputy Minister of the Political Department of the Military Affairs Commission, no communist leader occupies an important government position. Moreover, the so-called left-wing leaders holding positions in the government have also shown signs of decreasing day by day. Recently, after Chen Cheng resigned from the position of Minister of Politics, Guo Moruo, the Director of the Propaganda Department of the Ministry, a famous left-wing writer and poet, also resigned. After Guo Moruo left, the personnel in the Department have been completely transferred. (Reuters dispatch, 3rd)</p>

<h3>Son of American Newspaper Leader Howard Arrives in Chongqing; Stays in Chongqing for One Day and Returns to the United States by Plane; Says Chinese Resistance Attracts American Sympathy</h3>
<p>Chongqing: Mr. Howard, leader of the American Scripps-Howard newspaper system, arrived here by plane from Yangon this afternoon, and will fly to Hong Kong tomorrow. (Reuters dispatch, 3rd)</p>
<p>Chongqing: Howard, the eldest son of the American newspaper tycoon, arrived in Chongqing by plane from Yangon at 4:30 PM on the 3rd. People from all walks of life in China went to the airport to welcome him, including Zheng Kangqi, representing Foreign Minister Wang, and more than a dozen people from the press. After Mr. Howard got off the plane, he went to his residence to rest, and then went to Vice President Kong's tea party and Foreign Minister Wang's banquet in the evening. He also scheduled to pay his respects to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek on the morning of the 4th, and visit the US Ambassador at noon. He will leave Chongqing for Hong Kong at 3:00 PM in the afternoon, and then take a clipper to return to the United States. After Mr. Howard got off the plane, a reporter from the Central News Agency asked him about his impressions of his trip to the East. He said that the Dutch East Indies authorities have recently been very active in preparing to resist aggressors. In addition to striving for progress in the army and navy, they have also specially developed the air force. The reporter then asked about the attitude of Americans towards the Far East. He said that the Chinese resistance has aroused the general sympathy of the entire United States. However, the general public in the United States believes that under the principle of not getting involved in the whirlpool of war, it can indeed provide China with the greatest assistance.

<h3>American Newspaper Opposes Compromise with Japan</h3>
<p>New York: "The New York Times" stated in an editorial today that some say that we should immediately compromise with Japan, because we cannot be in a position of making enemies on both sides. For the benefit of the Americans, we are willing to see Japan restrained by the current war against China, and do not want it to be able to strike our interests or the interests of Britain in the Pacific. But we have a question: whether our appeasement of Japan will be better than the appeasement of Germany in Europe. The first result of appeasement may increase Japan's power to strike other places, or the Dutch East Indies, or Singapore, which is not certain. If we appease Japan for fear that Germany will gain control of the Atlantic, making it easier to strike the British naval power, then it is the most ridiculous thing. (Reuters dispatch, 3rd)</p>

<h3>Britain Still Able to Maintain Foreign Trade</h3>
<p>London - Minister of Overseas Trade, Johnstone, in a review to Reuters about the first year of Britain's trade during the war, said that Britain is still fulfilling orders for overseas customers after a year of war, and will of course continue to operate as usual in the second year. British exports to all parts of the world, except for enemy-occupied territories, have been maintained over the past year. Although the Germans have claimed to South American countries that Britain has been defeated and that Germany could deliver German goods in September and October, these empty words will not detract from the achievements of British commerce. The German propaganda claims that Lancashire has ceased work due to air raids, but in fact, Lancashire's cotton production has now increased. August is usually a quiet season for business, but in the first three weeks of August, Lancashire's cotton industry delivered a total of 50,000 bales per week, compared to an average of 51,000 bales per week in 1939. British customers can order British goods during the first year of the war, and Britain will definitely be able to fulfill them. (Reuters, 3rd)</p>
<h3>Anniversary of German Invasion of Poland</h3>
<p>London - Polish Prime Minister and Commander-in-Chief General Sikorski recently published an article commemorating the first anniversary of the German invasion of Poland, stating that German losses are estimated at 100,000 dead, 200,000 wounded, 1,000 tanks, and 1,000 aircraft. Poland resisted bravely at the time for over five weeks, but ultimately suffered a tragic defeat due to the disparity in numbers (one Polish soldier against four German soldiers, one Polish tank against twenty German tanks). As a result of the combined efforts of the Allied powers, coupled with the vast resources and fighting spirit of the British Empire, Poland will surely have a day to recover its territory.

<h3>Great Air Battle Between British and German Aircraft Over Southeast England - New German Offensive Fails Again - Northern London Area Bombed by German Aircraft</h3>
<p>London - There was fierce fighting in the skies over Britain again today. According to the latest news, 23 German aircraft have been shot down, and 15 British aircraft are missing, but 8 of the pilots have been rescued safely. When a large number of German aircraft flew over the southeast coast, air raid sirens were sounded twice in the London area. According to current reports, German aircraft dropped several bombs in Kent and Essex, causing minimal damage and a few casualties. The first alarm in London was sounded at 9:22 AM and had not been lifted by 10:00 AM. The people of London are now accustomed to air raid drills, so they calmly took refuge in air raid shelters after hearing the alarm, showing no signs of panic. At that time, British fighter planes were fiercely fighting with German aircraft over a town in the southeast, and at least two German aircraft were shot down. The alarm was lifted at 10:30 AM. London had a second alarm at 1:45 PM, which was lifted at 3:01 PM. (Reuters, 3rd)</p>
<p>Berlin - German aircraft bombed military targets in the northern London area this morning, during which air battles occurred with British aircraft. (Haitong, 3rd)</p>
<p>London - Yesterday, hundreds of German aircraft launched a fierce new air offensive, attacking dozens of cities and towns in London and other parts of Britain, causing another major air battle. London's 36th alarm (the third of yesterday) began at 10:35 PM yesterday (7:35 AM today, Shanghai Daylight Saving Time). The price paid by the German aircraft was quite heavy, as it was reported that 42 German aircraft had been shot down by 10:00 PM (7:00 AM today, Shanghai Daylight Saving Time). It was also heard that aircraft were flying over France, bombing important areas near Boulogne. According to rooftop observers, bright flashes of fire were seen in the suburbs of London during the recent air raids, indicating that German aircraft were dropping bombs. The second air raid yesterday occurred at 4:25 PM (1:25 AM this morning, Shanghai Daylight Saving Time). At that time, German aircraft broke through London's defenses, once with 30 aircraft and once with 40 aircraft. It was heard that Portsmouth, the Thames Estuary, the Bristol Channel, Liverpool, and various airfields, factories, and shipping centers in England and Wales were all bombed. (International News Agency, 3rd)</p>
<p>German Aircraft Attacking London Area Repelled</p>
<p>London - Yesterday, a large squadron of German air force came to attack, attempting to invade the London area again, but at least 42 were destroyed. The British side lost a total of 13 fighter planes, with five pilots rescued. It is now known that another three German aircraft were shot down on Saturday and Sunday last week, so a total of 88 enemy aircraft were shot down that day. One British pilot, reported missing on Saturday, is now safe. Yesterday, air raid alarms were issued three times in the London area, the last time at night. The first alarm lasted for 86 minutes. Large squadrons of German aircraft flew very high, hoping to reach the London area, but were met by concentrated interception by British fighter planes. Aircraft were seen in the distance to the east, and anti-aircraft guns fired a terrifying barrage, the sky completely covered by the dense smoke of exploding shells and German aircraft. Shortly after, British fighter planes tore through the sky, attacking the enemy aircraft fiercely. Last night, a squadron of about 40 German aircraft was seen in the suburbs of London, three of which were shot down by anti-aircraft fire within two minutes. Meanwhile, vehicular traffic continued as usual, and many workers decided to return home while the air raid was still in progress. Several pedestrians along the road watched as British fighter planes soared overhead. Seeing the strong resistance of London's defenses, the German aircraft fled in disarray. After the first alarm was issued in London at 7:00 AM yesterday, the German air force repeatedly attempted to attack, all day long. By the time the second alarm was issued in London, 25 German aircraft had been shot down. At 3:24 PM, a large number of enemy aircraft appeared to be flying in from both sides, but were dispersed by extremely intense anti-aircraft fire and were again attacked by British fighter planes. Another 70 or so enemy aircraft, divided into three squadrons, twice attempted to cross the sky over a certain area, two of which were blown to pieces in the air by anti-aircraft shells. Another squadron of enemy aircraft twice attempted to sneak through the defenses of a certain area in the southeast, when one Dornier bomber and one Messerschmitt fighter plane each caught fire and crashed in a field two miles away. At 4:50 PM, the German aircraft fled in panic, and the London skies were cleared by British Spitfire fighter planes. (Reuters, 3rd)</p>
<p>British Aircraft Conduct Activities Across the Channel</p>
<p>London - The Ministry of Aviation issued a communique last night stating that on the 1st of this month, British Air Force bombers flew over German, Italian, Dutch, and French skies for extensive activities, bombing enemy airfields at Eindhoven and Schiphol, aircraft factories at Munich and Stuttgart, oil refineries at Hagenau, Ludwigshafen, and Nordenham, ammunition factories at Leipzig and Bitterfeld, ships at Emden, power stations at Kassel, warehouses at Soissons and Mannheim, and numerous enemy airfields. British aircraft also flew to Italy, bombing the Fiat aircraft factory in Turin and the Ringhieri magnetic iron factory in Aosta, with great success. British coastal aircraft also flew to Lorraine to attack enemy submarine and motor torpedo boat bases. All British aircraft returned safely, with only one crashing while landing. According to the Ministry of Aviation's intelligence department, the area of the British Air Force's night raid on the 1st stretched 700 miles from the North Sea to the Lombardy region of northern Italy. Its new target was the Bosch-Ploeger Werke factory in Stuttgart. After British aircraft bombed this factory, which was heavily defended by anti-aircraft guns and searchlights, several explosions and fires were seen. Munich was attacked for the first time, and high-explosive bombs caused multiple fires along the railway sidings. The British aircraft bombing the Turin aircraft factory dropped bombs very effectively, causing explosions that shook even the British aircraft thousands of feet above. (Reuters, 3rd)</p>
<p>Goering Issues First War Report</p>
<p>Berlin - German Air Force Commander-in-Chief General Goering issued his first air force war report, stating briefly that German bombers and fighter planes attacked various airfields in southeastern England yesterday, destroying many aircraft hangars and barracks, several of which caught fire.

<h3>Italian Army Prepares New Offensive Against Egypt</h3>
<p>Vichy - Observers here have recently stated that Italy will launch a "blitzkrieg" against Egypt and Anglo-Egyptian Sudan within this month, after the end of the rainy season. The congratulatory telegram sent by Italian Prime Minister Mussolini to Duke Aosta, Commander-in-Chief of the African Army and Governor-General of Abyssinia, for the occupation of British Somaliland, stated, "After a period of rest and recuperation, your troops should continue to advance towards other goals with perseverance and determination, so as to expand the territory and authority of the Italian Empire." This shows that the Italian army taking a new offensive is only a matter of time. In addition, Italian newspapers also mention that Africa is the main battlefield for Italian troops, and the repeated bombing of Alexandria and ports along the Red Sea by Italian aircraft is a prelude to the "blitzkrieg". Generally speaking, the main target of this "blitzkrieg" will be the port of Alexandria. (Havas, 3rd)</p>

Hungarian authorities have organized volunteer police forces in every ceded city in Outer Transylvania. There are currently about 700 Hungarian residents and Hungarian police in Cluj. Observers fear that the tense situation here may develop into a terrorist incident, similar to the Soviet army's entry into Bessarabia and Bukovina. Reports of border clashes increased the terror of the general public here yesterday. It is said that a Romanian army unit stationed in Oradea refused to withdraw when the Hungarian army entered, and said that they would defend the country. Residents here are now rushing to move private property into Romanian territory. It is known that all military equipment here, including the anti-aircraft gun units that shot down three Hungarian aircraft last week, will be sent to the Bessarabian front. In addition, there is another worrying piece of news: according to military sources, 20 German aviation officers are currently in Outer Transylvania studying the terrain. (United Press, 3rd)</p>
<p>Cluj - According to news received here last night, Romanian troops yesterday drove the Hungarian Fifth Column out of the telephone bureau with bayonets and regained control of Arad and Teiuș. It is heard that Hungarian troops attempted to enter Arad, Satu Mare, and Sighetu Marmației. These areas were given to Hungary at the Vienna conference last week. It is heard that when Romanian and Hungarian troops clashed near Sighetu Marmației, nine Romanian gendarmes were killed. (United Press, 3rd) Bucharest - No further demonstrations have occurred here. However, recent news from Outer Transylvania indicates that active resistance to the Vienna Arbitration is growing rapidly. Army officers are currently uneasy and express resentment towards Germany and Italy. It is heard that local troops in Outer Transylvania refuse to withdraw from the positions they are stationed in.

<h3>Progress in Romanian-Bulgarian Negotiations - Territorial Issues Resolved - Economic Issues Still Under Discussion - Agreement Expected to be Signed Within the Week</h3>
<p>Sofia - Bulgarian authorities told our correspondent, Saschi, last night that the Romanian-Bulgarian negotiations in Craiova will take several more days to complete, but the agreement can be signed within the week. The postponement of the signing of the agreement is not due to the issue of Bulgaria's compensation for Romanian state property, but because the date of the Bulgarian army's entry into Southern Dobruja has not yet been decided. The issue of reparations has not yet been decided. The Romanian side has also raised minor issues, such as the withdrawal of Romanian minorities in Dobruja, and whether demonstrations will occur during the withdrawal, as in Outer Transylvania. The Bulgarian side says that this danger will not arise, as the Romanian people in the ceded area have only lived there for ten years, and those who have no land there will not oppose the withdrawal. (Haitong, 3rd)</p>
<p>Sofia - Bulgarian Prime Minister Filov told reporters last night that the territorial issue of Southern Dobruja has been completely resolved in Craiova. What remains to be discussed are economic and handover issues. Romania is asking Bulgaria to compensate for the railways and roads built by Romania after 1913, and is asking for an estimate of the property of Romanian farmers so that it can be sold to Bulgarians. Romania's asking price is very high, and Bulgaria does not want to accept it. In total, the land of Romanians in Southern Dobruja is 122,000 hectares, and the land of Bulgarians in Northern Dobruja is 77,000 hectares. Regarding this issue, if it cannot be resolved, Bulgaria will suggest that it be resolved by an arbitration tribunal. The migration of Bulgarians in Northern Dobruja has been stipulated to have a deadline of two months, while the deadline for the migration of Romanians in Southern Dobruja has not yet been stipulated. The most difficult issue is the date of occupation by Bulgarian troops. Romania hopes to delay it until all Romanians have withdrawn, but Bulgaria believes that the withdrawal of residents and the occupation by troops are unrelated. If Romania can accept Bulgaria's view, then the agreement can be signed. (Haitong, 3rd)</p>
<h3>Rumors of Imminent British Cabinet Reshuffle - Lord President and Foreign Secretary to be Replaced</h3>
<p>London - Political circles here learned yesterday that the British Cabinet will be reshuffled soon. Former wartime Prime Minister Lloyd George will succeed Lord President Chamberlain, and Secretary of State for War Eden may succeed Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax. This news is difficult to confirm, but according to politicians close to Prime Minister Churchill, it is still questionable whether the Prime Minister plans to reshuffle the cabinet immediately. The Conservative Party believes that the government is indeed poised for a reshuffle, and that ministers such as Simon, Solicitor General, Cadogan, Chancellor of the Exchequer Wood, and Greenwood may all leave their current positions. According to other reports, Chamberlain's condition is more serious than generally expected, so doctors have advised him to rest. (United Press, 3rd)</p>

<h3>Roosevelt's Loud Appeal: America Faces a Grave Crisis, Urging National Unity to Support the Government for the Early Completion of the Great National Defense Program</h3>
<p>Newfoundland, Cabot - President Roosevelt yesterday warned America here, urging the nation to take a stronger stance to cope with threats unprecedented in history. He stated that actions to attack free nations are about to begin, and the nation should "absolutely coordinate to engage in whole-nation defense work." The President said that the American people are evidently becoming "weak," and he urged the nation to be of one heart and mind, supporting the administration's great national defense program. The President's appeal to the nation coincided with the opening of the "Great Smoky Mountains National Park" for "the people of America enjoying freedom." The President's speech was partly an explanation of the nation's huge national defense program. The President said, "We have been weakened in many ways. If we must invigorate ourselves, then in this crisis-ridden world, we must not be weak. Because the threat the world gives to us is even greater than the threat to the frontline soldiers of America. However, we have an enemy hidden within the borders of the country. That enemy is a base and degenerate person who specializes in ridiculing ideals, despising sacrifices, and thinking that the American people only need bread to survive in the world. If the spirit of God does not descend upon our hearts, then we will not be able to have the determination to exchange all we have for Christian civilization. If that is the case, then we will be on the path to destruction. Our most important task is to keep the freedom won by our ancestors and the freedom stipulated by our constitution in this country for a long time. Besides this, we still have enemies from foreign countries. I hope that a hundred years from now, this 'Great Smoky Mountains National Park' will not fall into the hands of foreigners or into the hands of a puppet government controlled by foreigners. We all know to resist this crisis. We do not need to abandon the existing great progressive social system of Americans, and we will never give up. We do not need to exchange a better life for better self-defense. I suggest that both be retained. Since the invention of airplanes and radios, the world has almost become a small group. Europe is closer to us than from the foot of this mountain to the other. Therefore, in order to avoid this kind of crisis, Congress and I are creating a law that declares that all citizens have the obligation to receive military training and serve in the military. Driving men away from their homes and jobs, and urging women to give up their sons to serve in the military, may be a difficult thing, but the men and women of America are willing to sacrifice themselves for the group. Actions to deprive individual freedom have gradually spread to the Americas. In preparation, we should prevent it as soon as possible, or it will be too late. We must prepare in hundreds of ways. Talents are currently insufficient. What we need are well-trained leaders. We must build new naval bases so that our fleet can defend the coast. Men and women should be taught how to create supplies. We must counterattack the personnel sent to our country by dictators. It is a good thing to keep this cool mountain top for the people of the country, but we now have a more important task. We should keep our freedom. I hope that the trees in this park will not be cut down for the invasion of other countries. I hope that the roads in this place will continue to be built for freedom and rest, and will not be controlled by oligarchs as an institution for war. External enemies have been recognized by the majority of people. It is also known by the majority of people that this crisis cannot be resisted with crude weapons. The self-defense law announced by the legislative government is not intended to change the American way of life. On the contrary, this measure is purely for the preservation of the American way of life. Defending freedom is not easy. We must do our best to work together and not avoid thorough sacrifice. What kind of pasture will we defend? We will defend a life that allows the soul and body to enjoy unprecedented freedom. This kind of life makes human beings act in any way without harming others. This kind of life will make human beings unanimously obey God's commands. This way of life has been threatened. We can resist it with the spirit of the old frontier. We believe that the only complete person is a free person. We also believe that in the face of danger, the spirit of the old frontier warriors, that is, our blood, will give us courage and unity. At this difficult time, we need this spirit. We should all deeply feel that there is no division between us. We are all members of a group, all Americans. The wind blowing over the high mountains and wide sky, from Canada to Mexico, from the Pacific to the Atlantic, is always blowing towards free people. We are free today. If we, men, women, and children, unite to resist the current threat, then we can be free tomorrow. I hereby dedicate this park to the free people of America!" (3rd United Press dispatch)</p>

<p>Washington - The US Department of the Army, based on the National Guard Mobilization Act, which was signed by President Roosevelt last Tuesday, has prepared to conscript 60,500 National Guard troops from twenty-six states on September 16, according to President Roosevelt's instructions, to join the army for one year of training. The people conscripted on September 16 are the first batch of troops of the 1.2 million people that President Roosevelt wants to gather. These conscripted soldiers, according to the provisions of the Mobilization Act, will serve anywhere in the United States and its territories, but cannot be sent outside the territory of the United States. President Roosevelt declared that he hoped that this quota of 60,500 conscripted personnel could be increased to 76,689 people through expedited voluntary enlistment. The states that will conscript this first batch are New York, New Jersey, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Georgia, Oklahoma, Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado, · · · · North Dakota, Wyoming, New Hampshire, Delaware, Illinois, Missouri, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, California, Maine, Connecticut, Virginia, and Arkansas.

<h3>Tennessee Valley of the United States: Huge Power Supply Source, Important Position in National Defense</h3>
<p>Knoxville, Tennessee - Tennessee Valley Authority officials declared here yesterday, during President Roosevelt's speech at the "Great Smoky Mountains Park" near the area, that for seven years, the Tennessee Valley, which has become a testing ground for the "New Deal" by producing and supplying cheap electricity, has leapt forward and become a huge source of military supplies and ammunition for the US National Defense Forces. It is located hundreds of miles deep inland, far from points subject to external attack, and its eastern part is screened by mountains. The area is rich in minerals and has convenient electricity, so it can cope with everything needed by the National Defense Committee. In addition, transportation is also very convenient, with road, rail, and waterway connections. According to TVA Director Lilienthal, "This huge power supply here is now the largest strategic element in the United States. If there is a lack of this power supply, it may not be possible to produce the current required number of aircraft. Therefore, the electricity here is an indispensable dependence for American aluminum manufacturers. At this critical time, a larger power supply is needed, so we have ordered various methods to accelerate the construction of the water gates. Each water gate will be completed ten months ahead of schedule according to the scheduled procedure. Five new power engines will be added to the completed water gates. In Washington, the House Rules Committee passed a bill to allocate US$25 million to increase the electricity supply in the Tennessee Valley, in order to expand the local aluminum manufacturing for national defense purposes. Before the bill was passed, the Chairman of the National Defense Advisory Commission, Stettinius, also urged it." (3rd United Press dispatch)</p>

<h3>Japanese Cabinet Resolves to Vigorously Implement Fiscal Retrenchment, This Year's Expenditure Budget Reduced by 5.6%</h3>
<p>Tokyo - Today's cabinet meeting decided to implement the initial cabinet resolution on fiscal retrenchment. Therefore, it has agreed to reduce the net expenditure of this fiscal year's budget by 5.6%, except for special military expenses. According to this fiscal year's budget proposal, the net expenditure, excluding military expenses for China, is a total of 11,380,000,000 yen. Finance Minister Kawada, in order to strive for thrift, reduced 638,000,000 yen, accounting for 5.6% of the total. The method is to reduce the personnel and administrative and committee expenses of the various administrative provinces, and to reduce the government's subsidy of 500,000,000 yen by approximately 6%. The financial and business communities welcome this very much, believing that this move can make the material mobilization process proceed smoothly and can curb harmful financial inflation.

<h3>Kobayashi's Statement Before Going to the Netherlands East Indies: Determined to Conduct Negotiations with the Netherlands East Indies Based on Established National Policy</h3>
<p>Tokyo - Kobayashi, the Japanese special envoy sent to the Dutch East Indies, stated yesterday when he departed for Batavia that his appointment was to seek prosperity for the country.

<h3>British Diplomacy Gradually Becoming Brighter</h3>
<p>London - Reuters diplomatic correspondent said that since September of last year, British diplomatic activities have suffered several setbacks, but now there is a prosperous scene. The victory of the British Air Force has given British diplomatic work a bright support. The progress of Anglo-American events has never been as smooth as it is today. Whether the future successor to the president is Roosevelt or Willkie, the US government will continue to cooperate with Britain, as Churchill said, to seek mutual benefit for both sides. Knowledgeable people generally expect that the Soviet Union will not have any illusory developments, but they believe that Soviet-British interests will eventually converge. The Anglo-Turkish public, although attacked by Axis propaganda, was unharmed, and the long-standing Anglo-Portuguese alliance was as solid as a rock. Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and Uruguay are still Britain's best friends, and will not change slightly due to large-scale propaganda from Germany and Italy. The Muslim countries of the Near East and the Middle East have rejected Mussolini's self-proclaimed guarantor of Islam, and the propaganda of the Axis powers has failed in British colonies and is now failing in French colonies. Romania rejected Britain's guarantee of security and threw itself into the arms of the Axis powers, but in just a few weeks, it was miserably betrayed by its newly befriended friends. This is proof of what evil consequences are obtained by countries that abandon British guarantees. The fate of Romania does not weaken British diplomacy, but can consolidate it, because the small countries, in view of the Romanian incident, have received a warning of what will result from trusting the friendship of the Axis powers.

<h3>Ramblings on the European War (2) The Destitute Youth Hitler</h3>
<p>Hitler, the European eccentric and self-proclaimed Napoleon of the 20th century, the German Führer, his background is already roughly known to the world. He even wrote a book himself, "Mein Kampf," which sold very well. As the saying goes, "A hero doesn't fear humble origins." Often, a person's early life is filled with hardships and struggles, but later they establish world-shaking achievements. Hitler is one of the best examples of this. As for how the world admires him, hates him, or even curses him, that is another matter. In short, the fact that he endured countless hardships to achieve his current position is undeniable. The American "Saturday Evening Post" recently commissioned St. Clair McKelway to write an article, "Who is Hitler?" It recounts Hitler's life from birth until he began his political activities after the end of the last European war. A summary translation is as follows:</p>
<p>Hitler's name was Adolf Hitler. His father was named Alois Schicklgruber Hitler. At the end of the last century, he lived in a stone house with pointed arched windows in Braunau am Inn, Austria. He came from a shoemaker's background and worked his way up. At the age of forty, he became a minor tax official at a border checkpoint. Every day, he wore a brass-buttoned uniform and walked from his home to the office. When he met acquaintances, he was very polite. Farmers bringing agricultural products from Bavaria (on the north bank of the river, belonging to Germany) across the Rhine into Austria had to pay taxes to him. He carefully filled out forms, so busy he couldn't stop. After several years of this life, he retired on a pension.</p>
<p>Alois was stout, with a round, red face, short, strong legs, and iron-gray hair cut very short. He had a stubby, hedgehog-like mustache that he did not trim, allowing it to grow naturally. He loved his drink. Every day at noon and night, he had to drink several large glasses of beer. After drinking, he chatted and laughed with friends, enjoying himself immensely. By the age of fifty, his two wives, the original and the second, had already passed away one after the other, leaving behind several children. He married his third wife, who was only half his age. He was naturally pleased with this young and beautiful wife. Adolf Hitler was born to this wife, but as a child, Hitler was not very fond of his father, and sometimes even angered him.</p>
<p>Hitler's father held immense love and joy for this "late-in-life child" from the day he was born. However, when Adolf was four years old, his father began to feel a sense of incompatibility. One day, a Sunday, Hitler's father had some beer with lunch and felt very cheerful. He picked up little Adolf in his arms and wanted to swing him around. Just as he started to spin, Adolf suddenly cried loudly until his mother came and put him on the ground. He continued to cry loudly, rubbing his eyes with his two small fists, looking at his father with a mixture of hatred and fear through his tears. Alois finally held him on his lap and teased him, asking him to sip some beer from his glass. His older brothers liked to sip from their father's beer when they were learning to walk, so he wanted to do the same. But Adolf cried as if he were going crazy, and instead used his thin little hand to slap the beer glass. Hitler's hands had verdant jade fingers, as white and smooth as grease, like the soft hands of women since he was a child.</p>
<p>There were many such instances of disharmony between father and son. Adolf was very close to his mother, and his mother also loved him very much because he was very clever and sensible. His mother was tall and slender, with eyes like large ginkgo nuts and beautiful golden hair. Adolf's happiest moments of the day were the moments he spent sitting on his mother's lap. The rest of the time, his mood was erratic, even fearful and shrinking, looking somewhat absent-minded. His eyes, like his mother's, were large and watery.</p>
<p>When Hitler was eleven years old, a conflict broke out between father and son. "There are no wrong parents." His father hoped that his son would inherit his career and enter the officialdom, wearing a tax official's uniform like himself, receiving an official salary, and having a glorious future. But his son insisted on not following in his father's footsteps and did not consider it an honor to be a government official. At this time, his firm attitude became particularly obvious. At first, his father told him to study hard in preparation for serving the public in the future, but Adolf never took his father's advice to heart. Later, he simply expressed his opposition, his eyes brimming with tears, his face mournful, a thousand and one expressions of unwillingness.</p>
<p>His father, drinking, said to him, "Then, what exactly do you want to do?"</p>
<p>The child replied frankly, "I want to be an artist."</p>
<p>"An artist? A painter? Bah! Adolf, you're joking. It's best not to joke about serious matters."</p>
<p>In fact, Hitler was not joking with his father. He made everything very clear to his father. He even showed his father several watercolor sketches of their house, with a row of 18th-century windows and the jungle along the riverbank, which were also beautifully drawn. But what good did that do? Hitler repeatedly requested to become an artist in the future, but his father always refused.</p>
<p>"As long as I am alive, I will never allow you to become an artist," this was his father's adamant statement. From then on, father and son became irreconcilable. Hitler later wrote the following passage in his book "Mein Kampf," recounting the situation at the time: "My father extinguished any thought of me becoming an artist. I expressed that in such an environment, it was impossible to develop myself. Of course, the result of this expression only earned me the most unbearable reaction. He began to oppress me in every way. I remained silent for the time being. I believed that when my father saw that I was not making progress in school, he would yield to my wishes. Fortunately, my lack of progress in my studies was beyond doubt. I only studied the subjects that I thought would be beneficial to becoming a painter in the future. As for the other subjects, which I considered unimportant or could not arouse my interest, I simply abandoned them completely."</p>
<p>However, Hitler's father was not easy to deal with and did not yield to his son's method of resistance. On the contrary, whenever Adolf's school report was poor, he would unceremoniously whip him. Although Hitler, at the age of ten or so, was somewhat nervous and delicate, he was not weak. In school, he "rejected everything" he considered unimportant. When his father whipped him, tears streamed from his eyes as he tried his best to endure it, with a spirit of "desperate courage" mixed with resentment. He began to despise his father and all his actions. He decided not to drink in the future.</p>
<p>Hitler loved his mother to the utmost, truly from the bottom of his heart. In this terrible world that was difficult for him everywhere, as if wanting to get him and be satisfied, only she was the one he loved. Therefore, later when he saw any woman, he always thought of his mother first. Perhaps his inability to fall in love with any woman was based on this reason. He did not like to play with other children, but preferred to be alone. He had a self-centered style from a young age.</p>
<p>After a year or so, his father retired, relying on a small pension to live. The family also moved to a village in the Linz area. Adolf still did not like to study, and his father unceremoniously whipped him from time to time. In 1903, when Adolf was just fourteen years old, his father suddenly passed away. At this time, the child was able to do as he pleased and become an artist.</p>
<p>Without his father's obstruction, Hitler's mother followed her beloved son's wishes and promised to send him to the Vienna Academy of Art when he grew up. For the time being, he continued to dawdle in school. His grades at school were roughly as follows: conduct was A, attention was uneven, German, mathematics, and physics were average. Later, mathematics and physics showed some improvement, but German remained the same. Geometry and drawing were good at first, but later declined. Sketching was "good" at first, and later even "excellent." His writing was never very satisfactory, and he did not receive a diploma. Hitler's personality during his school days was still unpredictable, crying and screaming constantly, lazy and untidy. He liked to read in a disorganized manner. At one time, he was suddenly fascinated by an illustrated history of the Franco-Prussian War. He considered himself among the German heroes and deeply regretted that his homeland Austria's military was not as strong as Germany's. Like many Austrians, he wished he were German or that Austria, Hungary, and Germany would merge into a great empire.</p>
<p>At this time, he liked to draw pictures, but he was also casual and did not work hard or concentrate. In October 1907, when he was eighteen years old, he first wanted to enter the Vienna Academy of Art. He took his usual works with him. After the academy authorities looked at them, they did not ask him to participate in the entrance examination. He failed for the first time. The second time he tried again, the result was still that he did not have the talent for painting and could not be cultivated. Hitler recorded the situation at the time in "Mein Kampf." His disappointment overflowed between the lines. He said that after the academy officials looked at his paintings, they thought he lacked talent and that his temperament was close to architecture, asking him why he did not enter a civil engineering school. In fact, this was just an excuse. The academy authorities knew that he had no hope of studying painting, but they used architecture to comfort him and brush him off. Adolf was quite moved at the time and wanted to enter an architectural school, but according to himself, he ultimately did not succeed in entering an architectural school because he did not have a diploma from a preparatory school.</p>
<p>In the autumn of 1908, he did nothing and lived with his mother. A few months later, his loving mother passed away. From then on, Adolf was alone. But from this time on, in terms of his thoughts and actions, he became more successful in maintaining his greatness and self-respect. He did not complain about his setbacks. What he was deeply dissatisfied with was the world he was born into. Hitler became Hitler because of this.</p>

<h3>Yenching University Library Acquires Stone Inscriptions and Books from the Li Family of Shunde</h3>
<p>(Beiping Correspondence) In the autumn of the 28th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1939], the Li family of Shunde transferred about sixty or seventy kinds of stone inscriptions and books from their family collection that had been brought to Beiping to the Yenching University Library and also deposited more than twenty boxes in the library. Among them were banned books not recorded in the Siku Quanshu [Complete Library of the Four Treasuries] and secret books with annotations and colophons by Li Wentian, which are extremely precious. Li Wentian's courtesy name was Zhongyue, and his sobriquet was Shaonong. He was a Jinshi [successful candidate in the highest imperial examinations] in the Xianfeng reign of the Qing dynasty and served as a Vice Minister of the Ministry of Rites. His calligraphy was in the style of the Tang masters, and he had a very rich collection of books throughout his life. Aside from the books, which have not yet been cataloged and introduced, the following is a list of the deposited rubbings of stone inscriptions: (1) "Ode to Yang Huan, Commander of the Capital Garrison of the Han Dynasty." This is a Ming dynasty rubbing from the Junqing Hall of the Wu family of Nanhai. The characters in the ode were filled in with a hook. In the inscription, only the character "gao" [high] in "huo jie gao ge" [or explain high standards] has a missing stroke, and the strokes are slightly thicker than in more recent rubbings. (2) "Stone Stele of the Han Dynasty Confucian Temple for Setting Up Historical Officials and Soldiers." The character "bi" in "Biyong" [Imperial Academy] still exists, about seven-tenths of an inch high, and is a fine Ming dynasty rubbing. (3) "Stele and Shady Side of Han Dynasty Han Chi Constructing Ritual Implements for the Confucian Temple," Part 1. This was formerly in the collection of Feng's Kuixuetang [Hall of Quick Snow]. The stone flower has been removed, and the character "yu" [at, in, on] in "wang yu sha qiu" [died at Shaqiu] has a slight damage on the left side. (4) "Stele and Shady Side of the Han Dynasty Kong Temple of Tai Shan Military Commander." This is a rubbing from the Qianlong-Jiaqing era. Another shady side is a rubbing. (5) "Stele of the Han Dynasty West Mount Hua Temple." There are pages missing that have been filled in with hooks. It was formerly in the collection of the Linglongshan Hall of the Ma family of Yangzhou. There is also a re-engraved edition. (6) "Stele and Shady Side of the Han Dynasty Lu Xiang Shi Chou's Memorial to the Confucian Temple Sacrifice." This is from Kuixuetang, an extremely fine early Ming dynasty rubbing. (7) "Ode to the Western Gorge by Li Xi, Governor of Wudu of the Han Dynasty." (8) "Ode to the Fu Gorge by Li Xi of the Han Dynasty." (9) "Stele and Shady Side of Lu Jun, Commander of the Capital Garrison of the Han Dynasty." (10) "Memorial and Record of Yang Huai, Commander of the Capital Garrison of the Han Dynasty." This is a Ming dynasty rubbing. (11) "Stele of Yin Zhou, Han Dynasty Official in Yuzhou," second and third copies. (12) "Ode to the Achievements of Cao Quan, Magistrate of Heyang in the Han Dynasty." The Ming dynasty rubbing of the stele is interrupted, and the shady side is missing. (13) "Memorial and Ode of Zhang Qian of the Han Dynasty, and Shady Side." (14) "Stele of the Wei Dynasty Repairing the Confucian Temple." From Kuixuetang. (15) "Stele and Shady Side of Fu Qin Guang Wu General Chan," from Junqing Hall. (16) "Stone Gate Inscription of the Later Wei Dynasty." (17) "Grass Script of the Bei Wei Dynasty Zheng Xi Stele."

<p>Elementary School Teachers Live a Hard Life (Qujiang Correspondence) Huang Linshu, Director of the Guangdong Department of Education, went to eastern Guangdong to inspect education and returned to Shaoguan on the evening of the 21st of last month [August]. According to his observations during the trip, "The places we passed through, including Lianping, Longchuan, Wuhua, Xingning, and Meixian counties, made a very good impression. The focus of this inspection was to assess the situation of the three local administrative personnel training institutes located in the eastern region and to examine general education, especially the promotion of national education and the fundraising needed. During this trip, we consulted with the county governments of seven counties to resolve funding issues, and the results were quite satisfactory. We also inspected twelve middle schools and some elementary schools and met with more than forty elementary school teachers. The cost of living in eastern Guangdong is quite high. In Xingning and Meixian, one yuan can only buy eleven or twelve taels of rice. Elementary school teachers earn only twenty or thirty yuan a month. It is not difficult to imagine the hardship of their lives."</p>
<h3>Current Situation of the Surveying Department of Tongji University</h3>
<p>(Kunming News) The recent work situation of the Surveying Department of National Tongji University is as follows:</p>
<p>Since its establishment, the Surveying Department of the school has successively purchased various surveying instruments. In addition, due to donations from various German manufacturers and individuals, all equipment has become quite impressive. There are one aerial mapping correction instrument, one stereo comparator, and one multi-lens aerial mapping instrument each, as well as a set of phototheodolites. Photographs taken from airplanes or on the ground can be made into applicable topographic maps using the above instruments. There are more than twenty large and small theodolites, ten levels, and other instruments for ordinary surveying, as well as a complete set of darkroom and copying equipment for developing photos. The above equipment has all been transported from Wusong to Yunnan without loss. The subjects taught can be roughly divided into four categories: 1. Basic sciences, such as advanced mathematics, physics, and chemistry. 2. Ordinary surveying. 3. Aerial surveying, from aerial photography to mapping. 4. Geodetic surveying, such as triangulation, astronomical surveying, map projection, and the shape of the earth. In addition, two or three civil engineering courses are also taught as appropriate. Three professors specializing in surveying subjects are employed. The duration of study is set at four years. As for future plans, in order to meet the urgent needs of the war of resistance and national construction, special attention will be paid to aerial surveying. Aerial surveying is fast, cost-effective, and accurate. If the problem of aerial surveying can be properly solved, then military surveying in the front, economic construction in the rear, road construction, and land consolidation can all be easily resolved. In addition, the implementation of geodetic surveying, the solution of China's map projection problems, and the development of various surveying methods are also progressing simultaneously in order to achieve the independence of China's surveying science.</p>

<h3>Hezong Cup Basketball Tournament Opens Today, Paramount vs. Shanghai Qing, Liangxi vs. Youlian Starts at 5 PM</h3>
<p>The Hezong Cup Charity Basketball League will have its final act today, with two games scheduled to start earlier at 5:00 PM. The original women's volleyball performance has been cancelled due to a conflict with the amateur volleyball league. The first game is Liangxi vs. Youlian. The two teams are currently tied with four wins and five losses each. Today's outcome will determine who will be the third-place winner. The finale is Paramount vs. Shanghai Qing again. This is the focus of excitement, and the sensation is naturally expected. Although the outcome no longer affects the championship, neither side is willing to be careless in the battle for supremacy. In the initial encounter between Shanghai Qing and Paramount, Shanghai Qing had gained an absolute advantage several times, but Paramount reversed the situation with a pacification strategy, controlling the second half of the game. Shanghai Qing lacked coordination due to factional differences. Now, Shanghai Qing has fully understood the crux of the previous failure. Therefore, it is difficult to be absolutely sure whether Paramount can defeat Shanghai Qing again today. The closing ceremony today will be hosted by Mr. Yuan Ludeng, who will personally present the awards. The orchestra of the Refugee Children's Home will also be present to play music to add to the atmosphere. At that time, the basketball used in the game will also be auctioned by Mr. Yuan. In addition, Watson's Soda Company will provide its product Coca-Cola for the refugee children to sell at the venue at an unlimited price, donating all proceeds except for the cost to the home's expenses. Tickets are one yuan and will be available for sale starting at 4:00 PM. All long-term complimentary tickets will be suspended. The schedule is as follows:</p>
<p>Liangxi - Youlian 5:00 PM Zhou Jiaqi Zheng Zhifang</p>
<p>Shanghai Qing - Paramount 6:00 PM Qu Honglv Wu Zibin</p>
<p>(Paramount) Chen Xianglong, Lu Zhongen, Li Zhenzhong, Zhang Shaoqing, Zhou Zhi, Feng Nianhua, Bao Songyuan, Xu Wenkui</p>

<h3>Basketball Challenge, Someone Hosts</h3>
<p>Yuan Ludeng Righteously Hosts, Hoping All Teams Will Unite and Strive</p>
<p>After various newspapers advocated for the charity basketball challenge to resolve the basketball supremacy in Shanghai, all parties expressed their support. Paramount has righteously stepped forward and expressed its willingness to fight. Now, Yuan Ludeng, Chairman of the Refugee Children's Home, has also righteously come forward to host and witness its success. Hoping that challengers will unite and strive, so as not to disappoint Mr. Yuan's enthusiasm. The following is Mr. Yuan's letter:</p>
<p>To the esteemed [newspaper]: The Hezong Cup Basketball Tournament has now come to a successful conclusion, with very good results. This is all due to the enthusiasm and determination of the organizers and the public spirit of the participating teams. My gratitude is [expressed] sincerely. Now, there are also a few enthusiastic people who have initiated a battle for basketball supremacy, proposing that major Shanghai teams compete with the Hezong Cup champion Paramount to determine the victor. The Paramount team has responded in agreement, expressing their acceptance of the challenge and not shirking responsibility, deeply admired! However, the initiator is there, but there is still a lack of leadership. I am not talented, but I am willing to follow the gentlemen and serve as the host, in order to jointly plan the progress and see the success. Furthermore, the Refugee Children's Home does not have a fixed fund, and the monthly expenses amount to more than 10,000 yuan, relying entirely on temporary fundraising. The situation of deficit can be imagined. If the battle for supremacy is implemented, the income from tickets will definitely be considerable. I would like to appeal on behalf of the refugee children and still intend to donate the income to the home as food and clothing for the refugee children, which I believe will also be supported by benefactors. Knowing that your newspaper is enthusiastic about sports, I hope you will give your support to make up for my shortcomings. I am deeply grateful! I respectfully submit this and wish you well. Yuan Ludeng, September 1.</p>

<h3>Finance: Gold Buying Reaches Frenzy, Surpassing 6,300 Yuan Mark</h3>
<p>Yesterday, spot gold traded in the black market turned for the better, and market sentiment suddenly surged. The morning opening saw particularly strong buying, with an immediate jump of 75 yuan to 6,230 yuan. Subsequently, gold shops sold slightly, pushing the price down by 20 yuan. However, the exchange rate soon tightened, and money changers and securities firms aggressively entered the market, pushing the price up to 6,280 yuan. Later, due to some silver houses holding back, the price retreated to 6,245 yuan. Ultimately, money changers, silver houses, and others continued to buy, driving the price up to 6,275 yuan at the closing. The initial outlook for the market remained positive. Subsequently, rumors of negative news spread, and money changers and securities firms exited their long positions, pushing the price down to 6,245 yuan. The closing was reported at 6,290 yuan, resulting in an increase of 135 yuan compared to the previous day. The total transaction volume for the day was over 3,000 taels. Silver jewelry shops ultimately increased their prices by 10 yuan. Customs gold, etc., still...</p>
<p>Spot Gold Up 135 Yuan</p>
<p>From the morning, each bar (ten taels) initially saw strong sentiment due to soft foreign exchange rates. All parties were bidding at the opening price, while sellers were scarce. Therefore, the opening occurred amidst competition among buyers, raising the price by 75 yuan. A gold shop entered with 30 taels from a silver house, pushing the price to 6,230 yuan. Moments later, a certain gold shop suddenly took advantage of the high price to sell, and silver houses and money changers also sold at that time. Before long, the price had retreated to a low of 6,210 yuan. However, due to the tightening of foreign exchange rates, a certain money changer was eager to cover short positions, and securities firms also had a healthy appetite for buying, causing the price to rise again to 6,280 yuan. Later, a certain silver house exited its long positions, and money changers opened new short positions, causing the price to retreat slightly to 6,145 yuan. Eventually, due to the continued tightness of foreign exchange rates, money changers, silver houses, and others scrambled to buy. Although a certain gold shop closed out its long positions in between, a new recent high price of 6,320 yuan was created at one point. At noon, the exchange market stabilized slightly, and the buying frenzy gradually dissipated. Securities firms and silver houses mutually closed out positions, so the noon closing retreated slightly to 6,275 yuan. In the afternoon, gold shops first matched trades for 20 taels at 6,280 yuan. Subsequently, due to the large number of buyers, gold shops competed to buy, causing the price to rise again to 6,315 yuan. Later, a certain gold shop suddenly reversed and sold, immediately changing the market trend. Securities firms and a certain silver house competed to exit their positions. Before long, news of negative developments in the country spread, and operators opened new short positions, pushing the price down to 6,220 yuan. At that time, another securities firm added to its long positions, causing the price to rebound by more than ten yuan. However, the selling frenzy soon resumed, with cash gold shops selling particularly heavily, causing the price to retreat again slightly to 6,245 yuan. Later, news of a certain event suddenly spread, and securities firms aggressively entered the market at the low price, so the final closing was reported at 6,290 yuan, an increase of 135 yuan compared to the previous day. The fluctuation range for the entire day was 75 yuan. The selling price of cash gold shops' own-brand gold was more than ten yuan higher than the spot gold price, with the closing price reduced by 30 yuan. Spot gold was 50 to 60 yuan lower than the listed gold price.</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold Also Increased by Ten Yuan</p>
<p>The selling price of silver jewelry in silver shops was initially suspended at 630 yuan by Da Tong Hang. At 9:40, it was increased by ten yuan. There were no changes after that. As a result, Da Tong Hang changed its suspended price to 640 yuan. The new shops had similar prices to the above, with a reduction of about 30 yuan for buying.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange Market Outlook: Not a Small Sell-Off</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market situation: HSBC's listed prices showed no fluctuations. The black market for British and American exchanges continued to tighten, but there were many rumors of negative developments in the market outlook, such as Vietnam breaking away from the Pétain government, and Song Ziwen returning to Chongqing from the United States to resume his position as Minister of Finance. In the early afternoon, foreign firms had a strong need for flour and wheat settlements, and speculators were also buying near- and far-term US dollars, causing the price to soften. British gold also tightened uniformly. Later, due to the widespread dissemination of the above news, many speculators closed out their positions, but there was a lack of buyers in the middle, so the price did not loosen. The closing result was that the US dollar was re-quoted at 5.21875 yuan, and British gold was quoted at 3 pence 5/15625, a reduction of 0.03125 and 0.065 respectively compared to yesterday. The gap between futures and spot prices continued to narrow.</p>
<p>Foreign Firms Have Flour and Wheat Settlements</p>
<p>In the early morning, London large bars and near-term contracts all rose by 0.0625. New York silver had no market. Exchange rates for British pounds against US dollars in Shanghai and other places remained unchanged. There was no market for US dollars against British pounds in Shanghai and other places, as the previous day was Labor Day in the United States, and all industries were closed. The central bank's listed prices for various exchanges remained the same. Banks opened the spot selling price in the morning, with British gold at 3 pence 5.46875 and US dollars at 5.28125 yuan, both flat compared to the closing price on the previous day. After opening, the market softened slightly due to flour and wheat settlements by foreign firms. It was estimated that a foreign firm favorably sold 28125 and 25 of September British pounds to foreign firms, and the tightest US dollar spot price for October was 5.12875 yuan when the US dollar spot price was 5.1875 yuan. HSBC's listed prices remained unchanged. The silver equalization tax was announced to increase by 0.50%. The market stabilized slightly after that. A foreign firm favorably absorbed 5.25 yuan of US dollars for this month. However, Chinese speculators soon developed a desire to buy, entering the market to settle near- and far-term US dollars, causing the price to soften again. It was estimated that an American firm favorably sold 5.21875 yuan of US dollars for September to Chinese speculators, and 5.1875 yuan of US dollars for October. There was little change until the noon closing. As a result, British gold remained unchanged at 3 pence 5.46875, and US dollars were 5.21875 yuan, a reduction of 0.0625 compared to the morning opening.</p>
<p>Speculators Sell What They Bought</p>
<p>Rumors arose again in the afternoon, claiming that the Vietnamese government would break away from the Pétain government, and that Song Ziwen had returned to China from the United States with an important position as Minister of Finance. Operators believed that the news was negative, and speculators came to sell. It was estimated that they first sold 5.25 yuan of US dollars for this month to Hua Bi. Later, speculators found it difficult to sell, but Zhejiang and Shanghai continued to buy US dollars for the same month at 5.25 yuan. The closing result was still 3 pence 5.15625 for British gold and 5.12875 for US dollars. October British gold was 3 pence and a half, and US dollars were 5.1875 yuan, 0.03125 tighter for spot British gold and 0.0625 softer for US dollars compared to the previous day. The next month's British gold was 0.015625 softer, and the US dollar was 0.0625 tighter. Hong Kong US Dollar Tightens, British Pound Unchanged: Hong Kong, 3rd (Tuesday) telegram: The exchange market opened flat this morning. British pound spot and futures remained unchanged. The US dollar spot tightened by 0.0625, at 22.3115 yuan. The Shanghai exchange spot rose by 4 yuan, to 424 yuan. The Japanese exchange spot tightened by half a yuan, to 94.5 yuan. At 11:30, it was reported flat, with no changes in any exchanges. It remained flat until 2:30 in the afternoon, with no changes.</p>
<p>Tianjin Exchange Rates Unchanged</p>
<p>Tianjin, 3rd (Tuesday) telegram: The exchange market opened flat this morning. British exchange spot and joint bank notes in the black market were both unchanged. The US dollar spot softened by 0.03125, to 4.96875 yuan. The Shanghai exchange fell by 2.5 jiao, to 107 yuan.</p>
<h3>US Dollar Bills Break 19 Yuan Mark</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market situation: Spot gold suddenly surged again, with British and American gold pounds uniformly rising by 3 yuan. The American pound had reached as high as 150 yuan. British gold bills were slightly in demand, and the market price rose slightly. US dollar bills once rose above the 19 yuan mark, reaching as high as 19.02 yuan in the morning. Later, they gradually declined. In the afternoon, they retreated to 18.83 yuan, before ultimately rising to 18.93 yuan, an increase of 0.2 yuan compared to the previous day. Hong Kong bills were in high demand, and the market price rose sharply. Japanese gold bills once retreated to 1.62 yuan, before closing at 1.665 yuan, a continued decline of 0.01 yuan compared to the previous day. Korean bills were also in high demand, and the market price rebounded, reaching as high as 1.18 yuan in the evening, a sharp increase of 0.1 yuan compared to the previous day.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Raw Silk "Special Tax" to Be Increased Again, Japanese Merchants Intensify Cocoon Control, Shanghai Silk Market Likely to Close</h3>
<p>After the war, the Shanghai silk market experienced a period of prosperity. This was because a certain party concentrated its attention on the Wuxi area and had no time to attend to this area. However, since the autumn of the year before last, its control over Shanghai's raw silk materials has gone from difficulty to strict control. Therefore, many Shanghai silk merchants moved to small silk factories along the Shanghai-Hangzhou and Shanghai-Nanjing lines to solve the raw material problem. However, since the beginning of this spring, the finished products of inland small silk factories have not been able to be freely transported to Shanghai. Instead, a Japanese merchant must be used to transport them at a cost of 300 yuan per load. At the same time, the "Silk Special Tax Bureau" was also established, requiring an additional 110 yuan per 100 jin to be paid for raw silk transported out or exported. Although Shanghai merchants felt internal pain, they had to comply.</p>
<p>According to Mr. Xu of the "Special Tax Bureau," a meeting was recently held to discuss the method of increasing the tax. Participants included Mr. Shen, a representative of the Shanghai silk cocoon industry. According to Mr. Xu, the increased tax will definitely be implemented in the near future. White silk factories will be assessed at 4,000 yuan per load and taxed 480 yuan as a special tax, while native silk will be assessed at 2,000 yuan per load and taxed 280 yuan as a special tax. The calculation rate is the 12% that was widely rumored a month ago. When asked when it would be implemented, he said that he could not disclose it and that it could not be announced in advance. (A)</p>
<p>Recently, the silk market has been neither rising nor falling, and there has been no trading. Since the Yokohama spot market price has been maintained, speculators have withdrawn from the market, and the silk price has been sluggish. In this port, the British and French silk markets have not been able to develop, and it is said that Japanese merchants and foreign firms are also buying less. The reason for this is that inland control has been intensified, and the Shanghai silk market will be closed. However, the situation in the market may be that since silk can be transported by Japanese merchants, the silk price has been "too high." In order to make control more favorable, this step will naturally be taken to lower the silk price. Yesterday's Yokohama spot price was 1,350 yuan, the forward price was 1,425 yuan, and the New York closing was without market.</p>
<h3>Securities: Domestic Bonds Rebound Sharply in the Afternoon, Reaching New High Prices</h3>
<p>After a slight decline in the securities black market yesterday, Class C shares broke through the 3-yuan mark. The market suddenly rebounded in the afternoon, and various market prices reached new highs. The difference between the high and low prices in one day was a huge 1 yuan. The activity of the market restored the dynamic of previous formal times. The sharp rise in market prices was due to the fact that several short positions doing business on behalf of others had to be covered yesterday, causing the market price to rise sharply. Class C approached 54 yuan, with a market price of 53.9 jiao seen. Class B suddenly broke through the 7-yuan mark, rising rapidly for seven consecutive days. There was no news in the environment to stimulate it. Only after the market price rose sharply were there various rumors with different associations. They could not be proven and were not credible. Although the market price foundation in the future is firm, the surplus is too excessive. I am afraid that it will rebound due to selling, but there will be no formal decline. There were many short positions covered yesterday, and many retail investors bought. Hongda Lianhe's buying was the most active. Tongkang Lianyi, Hengfu, Yongchang, and No. 6 also bought. Xinfu, Hengkang, Xieda, Renchang, Shunchang, and Yongkang all sold. Class C fell into the 3-yuan mark in the morning, and Class C rose to 3.9 jiao in the afternoon, with huge fluctuations. There should be a slight change. As a result, the market price rose by 4.5 jiao to 7 jiao. The transaction volume was estimated at 1.8 million yuan. A concise table is listed below.</p>
<p>Stock Transactions: 100 shares of China Merchants Electric were traded at a price of 5.65 yuan.</p>
<p>Also, the Public Industry Exchange: Yesterday's stock market trend was uncertain, and prices fluctuated greatly, suddenly rising and falling. One point is worth noting: whenever prices are lowered by profit-taking or short-selling, new buyers immediately appear one after another. At the close, the trend of industrial stocks was softer than the best time of the day. This may have been affected by rubber stocks. There were many conflicting rumors about the latter. The opening in the early morning was extremely soft, but then it was suddenly rumored that the new regulations issued in Java and other places were not true, and the market immediately turned firm. However, sellers were timid and continued to exit the market, and prices ultimately fell back, but there were also many people who maintained at low prices.</p>
<p>London, 2nd (Monday) telegram: Today's listed prices for Chinese foreign debt and Far East British companies' stocks: Only British stocks had slight fluctuations. HSBC Bank shares rose by half a pound. British registered shares were 64 pounds, Hong Kong registered shares were 69 pounds, and Kaiping Coal Mine bearer shares fell by one shilling, to a price of 15 shillings. The rest were unchanged.</p>
<h3>Xingli Reclamation Pays Dividends</h3>
<p>Shanghai Xingli Reclamation Co., Ltd., managed by the British merchant Mai Bian Foreign Firm (i.e., China Reclamation Co., Ltd., operating the Zhongying Coal Mine in Mentougou, Hebei), yesterday announced that it would distribute an interim dividend for 1940 from September 27th, at 0.6 yuan per share in national currency.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Speculation Resumes, Double Horse Yarn Breaks 1,000 Yuan Mark</h3>
<p>The yarn market continued to rise, and the rising trend was particularly strong. This was due to the shrinking foreign exchange rate and the rising gold price, which sparked speculative buying. At the same time, short sellers, in view of this situation, actively covered their positions. As a result, they raised prices sharply with each other. However, actual sales remained sluggish, and transportation in all directions was still blocked. The price of Double Horse has risen by more than 100 yuan in recent days. It relies solely on the support of enthusiastic sentiment. Customers do not come to buy, and inventory is increasing day by day. The changes in the future must also be guarded against. Shenxin Factory took the opportunity to open 3,000 to 4,000 bales of ten-count Double Horse yarn at a price of 1,030 yuan, collecting a deposit of 150 yuan per bale, for October delivery.</p>
<p>The opening price of spot yarn in the morning was still relatively mild, with twenty-count Double Horse yarn at 990 yuan, a slight drop to 987 yuan. Then, it was heard that the US dollar exchange rate had shrunk, and speculative buying and short covering followed one after another. The market suddenly tightened, breaking through the 1,000 yuan mark to 1,014 yuan. Because a certain Kang Bank and a certain Guangdong long seller closed out about 400 to 500 bales, the price temporarily fell back to 1,007 yuan. Soon after, it was heard that the gold price had risen sharply, and the market turned from tired to brisk, rising to over 1,020 yuan. The closing price was 1,018 yuan, up 23 yuan. The amount of purchases made by various groups is listed on the left.</p>
<p>Fellow Traders: 3,500, Hong Kong: 50</p>
<p>Statistics: 3,550</p>
<h3>Cotton Trading Suddenly Booms, But Mostly Intra-Industry Speculation</h3>
<p>Spot cotton trading suddenly improved. This was because it had been weak for a long time, and at the same time, the shrinking wind of exchange bills reappeared, causing people's hearts to be excited. Intra-industry speculative trading arose at any time. However, apart from Japanese factories still making purchases, the factory side was generally quiet and not colorful.

<p>Another message: The foreign cotton market price in New York was Labor Day yesterday, and the market was closed for one day. India, including forecasts yesterday, also had no major changes.</p>
<p>The Shanghai foreign cotton trade has been quite active in recent days. This is because the inventory on the market is not abundant, so various parties are asking for unusually high prices, especially for long-fiber cotton. Qingdao merchants have a strong desire to purchase and are inquiring about prices and samples from various parties all day long, which is very busy. According to this situation, cotton prices will continue to rise.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Cotton Cloth Speculators Wait for Opportunity</h3>
<p>The cloth market is uniformly firm and rising. This is because cloth prices have been suppressed for a long time, and speculators are waiting for an opportunity to act. Yesterday, the yarn price rose strongly, and both insiders and outsiders gradually started to absorb it cheaply. Transactions were quite active. The selling price of fine cloth, fine twill, and bleached and dyed cloth rose by 0.15 to 0.5 yuan per piece, and coarse cloth rose by about 0.25 yuan. More than 1,000 pieces of various goods were traded on the street. Guangdong and Hong Kong merchants bought 200+ pieces of colored cloth and woolen twill. Zhejiang, Wen, and Tai merchants bought 300+ pieces of coarse cloth and colored cloth. Northern, Yantai, and Tianjin merchants bought 100+ pieces of blue cloth, twill, velvet coarse cloth.</p>
<p>Because both insiders and outsiders are optimistic about the eastern cloth, buying and hoarding are enthusiastic. The current warehouse receipt for 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth started at 33 yuan and rose to 33.3 yuan at the close. Four Gentlemen serge is 0.94375 yuan per yard. Various foreign firms have ordered a total of about 1,000 pieces of this month's futures fine cloth, mostly mid-range miscellaneous brands. The asking price for high-end Dragon Head fine cloth from Nissin Foreign Firm is 33.75 yuan.</p>
<h3>Seafood: Domestic Shrimp Tails Available for Sale</h3>
<p>Yantai shrimp tails have been arriving successively recently, and the destination is also quite lively. A batch was sold yesterday, with the hook-shaped steamed bun goods inside the customs being 345 yuan and the boxed goods being 310 yuan. However, only a bid of 300 yuan was offered for Shidao, and the deal was not made. The remaining Jiangbei tails were sold for 230-240 yuan, and the prices varied depending on the quality.</p>
<h3>Grain: Another Rumor of Haiphong Blockade, Foreign Rice Prices Rise Again, Japonica Rice Arrivals Plentiful, Selling Price Still Difficult to Loosen</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the rice market was bolstered by reports of Japanese warships blockading Haiphong, and general retailers, fearing drastic changes in the market again, unanimously took advantage of the low prices to make early purchases. For a time, buying sentiment suddenly increased, attracting hat-grabbing scalpers to compete. Holders took the opportunity to hoard and raise prices, and shouts were flying. Except for high-end goods, which were maintained at the evaluated price and could not rise or fall much, the prices of all foreign rice grades that had already been short saw prices rebound by about half a yuan per step. At the close, No. 1 Saigon Siam and Da Jiao remained outside the evaluation line. No. 2 Saigon Siam, except for 58.5 yuan opened in Puxi warehouses, reached 59 yuan again. Small Jiao was also similar. Tokyo Yu Jian was 55-56 yuan, Sui Jian was 46 yuan, and Mi Lu Te was 49.5 yuan, and then 48.5 yuan. Packaged rice was only half a yuan to nearly a yuan better. No. 2 Saigon Yinghua Company's initial opening price for imported rice was 70 yuan, then sharply increased to 70.05 yuan, and Siam imported rice was 70 yuan and 70.023 yuan for the bank. Non-marine insured rice ranged from 69 yuan to 69.5 yuan. Small Jiao opened at 69.5 yuan. The total was less than 300 tons. Spot goods totaled 7,000 bags.</p>
<p>Yesterday's arrivals of japonica and glutinous rice were slightly more, totaling 1,300 to 1,400 bags. It was rumored that due to the already expensive price, the trade in the open and black markets would not follow the return of foreign rice prices and remain stable, with little change. Changbang Te Qing Japonica opened at 73.5 yuan, 73 yuan, ordinary 71-72 yuan, Changzhou Su Kun Bai Japonica 70 yuan, 68-69 yuan, and Jue Zhi at 66-67 yuan. Qingjiao Bo Dao was 70.05 yuan, Nangang Early Rice in original package 69.8 yuan, 69.5 yuan, and see 66 yuan. Glutinous rice Jin Li Te was 66-67 yuan, and Changdan goods were around 65 yuan. Hong Kong Te was 67 yuan, and ordinary was 64-65 yuan. The source of Zhoupu New Japonica Rice continued, totaling 40+ shi. Supply and demand were similar, and the market was stable, with the price opening at 66 yuan. Taicang New Yangjian also continued to arrive with 20-30 shi, opening original package at 64 yuan and seeing 59.5 yuan, 59 yuan.</p>
<h3>Spot Flour Turns Firm, Fufeng Factory Reduces Supply by Half</h3>
<p>Flour: The spot flour market turned firm yesterday because Fufeng Factory, in view of the insufficient supply of wheat raw materials, reduced its supply to the street by half, causing spot flour from old-brand cars to decrease sharply, and people's hearts could not help but harden. Foreign flour and inland flour were rarely opened, and the trading of Dong flour's Phoenix brand, which speculators were watching, became active again due to the rising rice price. Spot prices were first raised, and futures were also tighter by 0.05 to 0.1 yuan, with this month opening at 14.5 yuan and October opening at 15.133 yuan to 15.15 yuan. A total of 6,000-7,000 bags were traded.</p>
<p>Wheat: Trading continued to trend in a Zhou direction because the source of Hongkou was not abundant and the sellers were stubbornly holding on. Also, recently, the export group had been purchasing slightly, all contracted by a certain party, and the buying price had been raised by 25 yuan, causing more difficulty for Chinese factories to collect wheat. Although prices were released, there was a lack of whole amounts to take. Tongsheng Daily Factory continued to purchase more than 2,000 bags of wheat from Kunshan, Jiading, etc., at prices ranging from 21.5 yuan to 22 yuan. It was difficult for the market to rise or fall.</p>
<h3>Oil Market: Raw Soybean Oil Market Fluctuates Violently</h3>
<p>Yesterday's raw soybean oil market situation: The waves fluctuated violently throughout the day. Although the overall situation was said to be balanced between arrivals and sales, which aroused people's hearts, the ups and downs of market prices were completely controlled by scalping. The result was that the closing trend remained tight. It was estimated that 100 barrels of Dalian soybean oil were traded at prices ranging from 99 yuan to 100 yuan, 50 pieces of Qingqi soybean oil were traded at a price of 71 yuan, and 150 pieces of Yanqi soybean oil were traded at a price of 72 yuan. More than 800 loads of Da You Yu factory soybean oil were traded at prices ranging from 77 yuan to 77.5 yuan. Also, 100 pieces of Jiaozhou spot raw oil were traded at a price of 65.5 yuan, with 100 pieces for delivery in the first half of September at prices ranging from 63.5 yuan to 64 yuan, more than 1,300 pieces for delivery in the second half of September at prices ranging from 63 yuan to 64.5 yuan, 550 pieces for delivery in the first half of October at prices ranging from 63.5 yuan to 64.5 yuan, and 600 pieces for delivery in the second half of October at prices ranging from 64 yuan to 64.5 yuan. 50 pieces of Yantai spot raw oil were traded at a price of 65.5 yuan, and 300 barrels of Qingdao spot raw oil were traded at prices ranging from 91 yuan to 93.5 yuan.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Only Coarse White Rises</h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market rose by several jiao due to the tightening of the US dollar, but then gradually returned to flat due to poor actual sales by importers. The association's designated prices were 78.2 yuan for new No. 2-4 coarse white goods, up 0.7 yuan, and 76.5 yuan for old goods, up 0.5 yuan. Mack Hall red was 63.5 yuan, 63.4 yuan, returning to 63 yuan. KD Mack Hall Cotton White was 73.6 yuan, Taikoo B Mark was 77 yuan, and DY Mark was 73.7 yuan to 73.5 yuan, similar to the previous day. Also, 800 tons of sugar came from Holland yesterday, and 7,400 bags came from Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods: New Longan Meat Rises 10 Yuan</h3>
<p>Since the decline in new Hainan longan meat, the production market has seen a turning point, and the number of arrivals this time is rare, so the bid has tightened. Yesterday, Nanshi number houses had already opened more than 200 pieces, with the higher price being 135.5 yuan and the next highest only about one yuan different, up 10 yuan compared to the previous time.</p>

<h3>Fourteen Food Stores Falsely Reported Quantities</h3>
<p>Detected by Police Investigation; Prosecuted for Fraud</p>
<p>The *North China Daily News* reports that the Public Concession's Municipal Police Department, in order to crack down on illegal profiteering and deception of customers by merchants within the concession, established a Weights and Measures and Licensing Section on August 15th. Deputy Inspector Fernantai, formerly of the Central Police Station, was put in charge. He immediately investigated cases of short weight and quantity of goods and inspected food stores in the Jing'an Temple area, discovering that fourteen of them were selling sugar with shortages ranging from half an ounce to three ounces per bag. They were charged with fraud and summonses were issued. The Special First Court, at the request of the Police Department's legal section, is expediting the hearing of these cases and has scheduled the hearings for the 4th and 5th.</p>
<h3>Bloodshed on Fuzhou Road Yesterday: Liu Na'ou Shot Dead; Shot Suddenly While Having Lunch with Japanese Friends; Died of Two Bullets Before Reaching the Hospital</h3>
<p>At 2:15 PM yesterday, a customer was suddenly shot at and killed in the Kinhua Restaurant on Pingwang Street, Fourth Road, Public Concession. He was shot three times and died on the spot. The details obtained are recorded below:</p>
<p>Coming Downstairs After Lunch</p>
<p>Around noon yesterday, more than ten Chinese and Japanese people were having lunch in Room 1 of the Kinhua Restaurant at 623 Fuzhou-Pingwang Street, in high spirits. Around 2:15 PM, the meal was over, and the guests were scattering. At this time, a Chinese man in a suit slowly walked downstairs, intending to go home. Unexpectedly, as he stepped onto the stairs, a man also in a suit, who had been waiting in the first dining room beside the stairs, saw him coming downstairs and immediately rushed out, drew a gun, aimed, and fired three shots in rapid succession. The diner was caught off guard, and two bullets hit his chest. He cried out in extreme pain and collapsed on the stairs in a pool of blood.</p>
<p>Hit by Two Bullets</p>
<p>Seeing that his goal had been achieved, the shooter rushed out the door, jumped into car number 4632, which was waiting by the roadside, and fled without a trace. At this time, nearby patrolmen gathered quickly after hearing the alarm, but the assailant had already escaped far away. The wounded man was helped into car number 4402, which was provided by his Japanese friends, and driven to Renji Hospital for treatment. However, because the injuries were to vital organs, he died before reaching the hospital. Afterward, the police transferred the body to the coroner's office for examination and notified all police stations to search for car number 4632. As a result, it was reported that half an hour after the incident, the Old Gate Police Station had found a suspicious car, which was identified as number 4632.</p>
<p>Brief Biography of the Deceased</p>
<p>The deceased, a man in a suit, was identified as Liu Na'ou, a native of Fujian, 41 years old, and a new writer. Before the Sino-Japanese War, he served as the Director of the Directing Department of the Nanjing Central Film Studio. Last year, he became the General Manager of the China Film Company established by the Japanese Asia Development Board. The company was located in the Hamilton Building. Liu was very familiar with the film industry in Shanghai. It is said that Liu was the one who handled the export of the "Camellia" film, which was the subject of a heated dispute in Shanghai, to Japan. The cause of this shooting is being investigated by the Public Concession Police.</p>
<h3>Small Fishing Boat Sailing from Shanghai to Songmen Shot at Twice</h3>
<p>Xin'an Steamer Enters Fujian Waters; Goods on the Sede Steamer Bombed</p>
<p>The Fongsheng Company's Xin'an steamer has been out of Shanghai for nearly ten days. The steamer has telegraphed that it has been delayed due to sheltering from the wind and has now arrived in Fujian waters. It is expected to arrive at the Haikou port of Fuqing in about two days (yesterday evening). It also said that it did not encounter any obstruction from Japanese warships along the way.</p>
<p>Fishing Boat Sailing to Songmen</p>
<p>The English *China Press* reports that on August 15th, a small fishing boat sailing from Shanghai to Songmen was shot at twice by the Japanese Navy and boarded and questioned three times. It finally returned to Shanghai yesterday (the 2nd). According to a passenger on the boat, when the fishing boat arrived at its destination, Songmen, it encountered a Japanese gunboat for the first time, which issued a signal ordering it to stop.</p>
<p>Loading Water and Returning</p>
<p>Shortly afterward, a Japanese officer boarded the fishing boat and told the captain that navigation in that sea area was prohibited, but he was allowed to dock for two hours so that the crew could load fresh water onto the boat. When the two hours were up, the Japanese gunboat fired a blank shot, and the fishing boat turned around and sailed back. When it reached Haimen, it was again ordered to stop by Auxiliary Ship No. 31 of Japan, which had recently intercepted the German ship Hana. A Japanese officer boarded the ship.</p>
<p>Forced to Sign a Letter</p>
<p>The captain was forced to sign a letter stating that the fishing boat would never sail in the prohibited waters again before being allowed to proceed. The fishing boat then arrived at Dinghai, where another Japanese warship fired a shot, forcing it to stop. It was escorted to Ligang, and its documents were taken away. After the captain submitted a written request, the Japanese allowed it to leave and return to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Goods on the Sede</p>
<p>According to a telegram received by the shipping industry, after the Italian ship Sede entered Aojiang, Japanese planes flew over the area and bombed it, causing considerable damage to the goods unloaded ashore, totaling about 500,000 yuan. The authorities have ordered all coastal areas to quickly find ways to evacuate all resources.</p>
<p>Jiangsu Sailing to Aojiang</p>
<p>According to a reporter's inquiry yesterday, the British ship Jiangsu is scheduled to set sail from the Bund Observatory Pier in the French Concession at 5:00 AM this morning for Aojiang. As for the Songmen route, after the German ships Mofufu, Gaoden, and Haiyi sailed there the other day, the Liping ship will also sail there today. The Hana ship was moved to the Roosevelt pontoon yesterday and docked alongside the Baoli ship to wait for resumption of navigation.</p>
<p>Customs Clearance at Haikou</p>
<p>Since the Japanese announced a ban on navigation in Fujian and Zhejiang for the second time on the 15th of last month, the Jianghai Customs only allowed customs clearance at Fuqing for Fujian ports. A reporter inquired with the Jianghai Customs yesterday and learned that the Haikou port near Fuqing has also been approved for customs clearance. As for the ports in Zhejiang Province that are allowed for customs clearance, only Songmen Gu'aotou is still approved.</p>
<h3>US Vice Consul in Hankou Transferred to Korea; Coming to Shanghai Next Week to Go to Korea</h3>
<p>The English *China Press* reports that the new US Vice Consul in Hankou, Emmons, came to China from the United States two weeks ago, passing through Shanghai and going to Hankou. He has now suddenly received orders to be transferred to Seoul, Korea, as Vice Consul and is expected to arrive in Shanghai from Hankou next week and transfer to Korea.</p>
<h3>Heavy Alert Suddenly Imposed in the French Concession This Morning; Temporary Obstacles Erected at All Intersections; Number of Patrolmen Increased in the Public Concession</h3>
<p>Around 12:00 AM this morning, the French Concession suddenly took temporary emergency precautions. From the Bund to Haig Road, barbed wire was erected at important intersections along Avenue Edward VII. Except for a gap left at Rue Montigny and Avenue Albert, all other traffic was cut off. Vehicles and pedestrians were strictly inspected. No barbed wire has been erected at the intersections in the Public Concession, but the number of patrolmen on duty has been increased.</p>
<p>Patrolmen and Defense Forces All Deployed</p>
<p>After the French Concession Police Authority took sudden precautions on the 31st of last month, the French defense forces and all police officers were dispatched to conduct searches throughout the French Concession and set up obstacles in important areas. Vehicles and pedestrians were subjected to</p>
<p>Strict Inspection</p>
<p>The work is tense and has not been relaxed. Moreover, the nature of the precautions seems to be becoming more strict. The central area remains the most tense. French police officers patrol the streets in teams of five or six, searching constantly. Armored vehicles also patrol back and forth, appearing quite busy. Patrol teams are also stationed on the roads traveled by public buses, ready to</p>
<p>Order Stops</p>
<p>For strict inspection. In addition, what is most noteworthy is that roads such as Avenue Lafayette, Rue Luban, Avenue de la Cathédrale, Avenue de Messimy, Rue Pétain, and Avenue Foch, which were previously not defended even on important anniversaries, have now been blocked with barbed wire. Only a</p>
<p>Gap Left</p>
<p>And a large number of patrolmen and French defense forces are stationed at each point, monitoring those coming and going very strictly. There are also barbed wire frames prepared on both sides of other less important road intersections in the central area, ready to be closed at any time. Although the mood is very tense, there are no restrictions on the entry and exit of ordinary residents.</p>
<h3>Ningbo Implements Grain Rationing</h3>
<p>Adjusting Surpluses and Deficiencies; Panic Can Be Relieved</p>
<p>According to news from the shipping industry, Ningbo has decided to implement grain rationing after the 10th of this month. All people who have registered their household can register at the police station or police sub-station in their jurisdiction and purchase grain with their registration. Each adult receives six *he* and each child receives four *he*. The price of grain will be assessed and sold at a fair price by the Evaluation Committee. From then on, Ningbo's grain supply will be able to adjust surpluses and deficiencies, and panic is expected to be relieved.</p>

<h3>Rice Prices Assessed Yesterday; Only Small-Kernel Yang Rice Rated at $0.50 Lower; Remaining Varieties of Yang Rice Actually Remain at Previous Prices</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Rice and Grain Evaluation Committee originally stipulated that it would assess the highest market price of various rice and grains with reference to the amount of rice and grain in stock, the amount arriving, the amount sold, and the production price, etc. It would be assessed twice a week, on Tuesdays and Fridays, and implemented on Wednesdays and Saturdays. Later, because the rice market gradually stabilized, it was decided that the evaluation date would be decided on an ad hoc basis. Recently, the rice market has once again become turbulent, and the committee immediately resumed the original evaluation date. Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, the committee met again at 15 Avenue Edward VII, 3rd floor, and decided that, with the exception of small-kernel yang rice, which was rated at $0.50 lower, the remaining goods would maintain the prices assessed on the 30th of last month. The market will be notified and implemented today. The resolution is abbreviated. The meeting adjourned around 5:00 PM.</p>
<p>Implemented Today</p>
<p>The highest prices for yang rice assessed by the committee yesterday have been announced to the market for implementation this morning. "It has been assessed by this committee that, starting from the 4th of this month, the highest price per *dan* for various yang rice varieties are listed as follows: No. 1 Saigon Siam $61.50, Fire-Kernel $61.00, No. 2 Saigon Siam $59.00, Small-Kernel $58.50, High Tokyo *Usu* Rice $56.00, Tokyo Brown Rice $52.00, Rice Tea $50.00, Mixed Broken $46.00. For those traded through Inghua Book, the highest price, including war risk insurance, is as follows: No. 2 West Siam $71.00. The above prices must be strictly observed. Market transactions are only allowed below these prices and must not exceed the limit. If there are any secret deals, they will be reported to the authorities of the two concessions for severe punishment. Furthermore, it has been found that the market has recently exceeded the price of Saigon, which is absolutely not acceptable. In the future, no matter what kind of highest yang rice, it must not exceed the price of No. 1 Saigon. Please pay attention to this. This is a special announcement."</p>
<p>Inventing Names</p>
<p>A reporter from the *New Voice* learned from the rice industry in this city yesterday that unscrupulous rice merchants are designing all kinds of ways to reap huge profits. Their intentions are truly unfathomable. Since the Evaluation Committee approved the relaxation of the price limit, these people believe that the price limit is only a formality, so market transactions have exceeded the price limit. Except for No. 2 Saigon, Rice Tea, and Fire-Kernel, which are still being traded, there are no transactions for other goods. Holders are still waiting for higher prices to be released. Brown rice is also being misrepresented as Tokyo *Usu* Rice, which has led to it exceeding the price limit. They are also inventing a name called "Annan *Jing*," claiming that it is of better quality and opening prices as high as $70 per *dan*. Annam *Jing* is just a variation, and there is no such type of rice on the market. Speculative rice merchants are so cunning.</p>
<p>Prohibiting Concurrent Operations</p>
<p>It is also learned that the Miscellaneous Grain and Oil Cake Exchange at 15 Avenue Edward VII resumed its afternoon market on the 2nd of this month. In addition to trading miscellaneous grains, it also engages in rice and grain. In order to unify the rice and grain trade, the Rice Evaluation Committee has decided to send a letter to the trade association to temporarily suspend its afternoon market's concurrent rice and grain business. Furthermore, all rice businesses in this city have decided to adopt suggestions from various sectors and follow the instructions of the authorities of the two concessions, as well as to plan for the future. They have already made arrangements to entrust French Daifu Foreign Bank, British Heiyi Foreign Bank, and Swedish Fujia Foreign Bank to order a large quantity of yang rice from Saigon by telegraph for gradual transport to Shanghai for adjustment. It is said that the quantity is 100,000 bags (i.e., 1,000 tons).</p>
<h3>Water Rates Will Not Increase Again This Year; Company and Municipal Council Decide After Consultation</h3>
<p>According to a statement released by the Municipal Council, when the Municipal Council approved the Shanghai Waterworks Company's increase in water and electricity surcharges to 110% in May of this year, it also decided to invite the company to send representatives to study with representatives appointed by the Bureau the gold pound dividend that the company should pay according to the regulations, in order to reduce the burden on users. After being invited by the Bureau, the company sent representatives to meet with representatives of the Bureau several times, and as a result, the company agreed not to apply for an increase in water surcharges again this year.</p>
<h3>Aftermath of the Bombing of Aojiang</h3>
<p>Regarding the details of the bombing of Aojiang by Japanese planes, the Zhejiang Provincial Associations in Shanghai received a report yesterday stating that at 12:50 PM on the 16th of last month, the Pingyang air defense observation post issued an emergency alert, reporting that nine Japanese seaplane light bombers were approaching from Chapu, Fujian, speeding towards the skies over Pingyang County. At 1:15 PM, after distributing absurd leaflets, they flew to Ruian for a week of reconnaissance and then returned to Aojiang to rendezvous. The remaining six planes flew low, dropping bombs and strafing with machine guns. At 2:10 PM, the group of Japanese planes gathered and left along the original route. It is estimated that 28 bombs were dropped on the Aojiang urban area, including 7 incendiary bombs, destroying more than 200 houses and killing or injuring more than 50 civilians. After the alert was lifted, County Magistrate Zhang sent Assistant Secretary Xiao and Chen, the adjutant of the National Soldiers Corps, along with nurses from the County Health Center, to Aojiang to supervise the rescue. Subsequently, Section Chief Liu of the Civil Affairs Section and Director Shi of the Political Work Office, along with Zhu Zhongren of the Cooperation Office, also went to express their condolences. The fire was raging, the disaster area was vast, and the refugees were running and screaming, a truly tragic scene. The next morning, County Magistrate Zhang convened an emergency meeting of local gentry and decided that the county government would temporarily advance 2,000 yuan and distribute 10 bags of rice to provide immediate relief. He also telegraphed the Central Relief Committee requesting funds to relieve the disaster victims. In the afternoon of the same day, County Magistrate Zhang personally went to Aojiang to inspect the situation and distribute emergency relief funds, as well as to console the families of the dead and injured disaster victims, returning to the county late at night. The material losses from the bombing of Aojiang this time are estimated to be over 500,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>US Luzon Gunboat Leaves</h3>
<p>The US Navy's Shanghai-based shallow-draft gunboat Luzon departed from the British Navy's pontoon in the Yangjingbang port at 2:00 PM yesterday and cleared the port at 3:30 PM, heading upstream on the Yangtze River. Its destination is unknown.</p>
<h3>City's Egg Products Sell Well in the UK</h3>
<p>Account for the Majority of Total Exports</p>
<p>The UK consumes a huge amount of eggs every year, relying on supplies from Denmark and the Netherlands. Since both the Netherlands and Denmark were occupied by Germany, the domestic egg supply in the UK has become difficult, so it has turned to purchases from the Americas, Australia, and Asia. Recently, egg products have accounted for the majority of goods exported from Shanghai and other parts of the country to the UK. According to customs statistics, egg product exports to the UK in July totaled 3,097,726 yuan, accounting for about three-quarters of the city's total exports.</p>

<h3>Today's Tides: Autumn Tides Surged Yesterday, More Than Ten Sections of Low-Lying Roads Flooded, Pacific Hurricane Approaching Shanghai Again</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at one o'clock, the autumn tide of the Huangpu River suddenly rose, exceeding the predictions of the Huangpu River Dredging Bureau. The Bund's riverbanks were almost level with the autumn tide. The tide gurgled and flowed backward from the sewers. Places such as Zhejiang Road, Niuzhuang Road, Guizhou Road, Yinghua Street, Jiujiang Road, Gansu Road, Alabaster Road, Foch Road, and Avenue Joffre all saw the tide emerge, and the roads were a vast expanse of water. In the deepest accumulation of water, it could reach the knees. For example, the section in front of the New Stage Theater on Niuzhuang Road was completely surrounded by water.</p>
<p>The Weather is Gradually Cooling</p>
<p>The reason why the high tide exceeded the predictions of the Huangpu River Dredging Bureau was that yesterday happened to be one of the days when the moon was closest to the Earth, so the water level rose quite high. Today is the third day of the eighth lunar month, which is a period of high tides. It will take a week before it can subside. Furthermore, the weather in Shanghai has been quite cool for the past few days, especially in the morning and evening. The lowest temperature is only around 70 degrees Fahrenheit, so summer illnesses have greatly decreased. However, at this time of sudden cooling after prolonged heat, one should pay more attention to health, lest one be afflicted by diseases. It is also reported that various epidemic hospitals in Shanghai are preparing to close by the end of this month.</p>
<p>Hurricane News</p>
<p>The violent Pacific hurricane, after making landfall at Sanduao, reached the area south of Nanjing at 6:00 AM the day before yesterday. By 2:00 PM, its direction shifted northeast again, passing northwest of Shanghai, crossing Chongming Island, and entering the Yellow Sea. At 6:00 AM yesterday, according to a report from the Xujiahui Observatory, the hurricane had reached 34 degrees North latitude and 123 degrees East longitude in the Yellow Sea. The wind force had subsided within 60 nautical miles. The impact of the hurricane on Shanghai has completely dissipated, and the weather has also become sunny. However, according to another report from the observatory, a new hurricane has formed in the Pacific Ocean and, as of 6:00 AM yesterday, had reached 21 degrees North latitude and 134 degrees East longitude, moving in a northwest direction. The center of the wind force is within 120 nautical miles. If the direction does not change, Shanghai will face a severe threat.</p>
<h3>Garment Industry Adds Wages: Workers Demand 60%</h3>
<p>There are no fewer than several thousand garment shops in Shanghai's Jiangsu and Guangdong communities, employing tens of thousands of workers. Wages are usually very low. There was a strike this spring, which resulted in a slight increase. Because the workers' wages have increased, the shop owners believe it is necessary to change the garment prices for customers. Therefore, the garment guild decided on uniform prices and issued them for the industry to follow. However, how to distribute the wages to the workers or how to appropriately increase them was not mentioned. The workers in this industry then proposed a distribution method to the workers' union. It is now learned that the union has accepted the workers' request to use a 4-6 distribution principle based on the guild's price list. In addition to making a request to the guild, a letter was sent to the Public Works Department yesterday requesting that representatives from both labor and management be convened for mediation. The original letter is transcribed below: "Because the price of goods is expensive and life is becoming increasingly difficult, wages in various industries have increased. The environment is driving this, and our garment industry should be no exception. Therefore, the guild has repeatedly held meetings to discuss ways to increase wages. It has now unanimously decided on uniform wages and has issued a price list, ordering the industry to comply. Unexpectedly, the current wage increase does not benefit the actual workers at all, but is instead enjoyed solely by the garment shop owners. How can this kind of unfair treatment be tolerated? All the workers are indignant about this. Therefore, worker representatives have gathered together for a joint discussion. They all believe that the workers' actual wages should be 60% of the guild's price list. The remaining 40% should be used for the shop owners' expenses, and other treatments should remain the same. Calculating according to this rule is more fair. The source of wages is the workers' labor. By definition, the increased wages should belong entirely to the workers. In order to seek social stability and the welfare of our members, our association is now requesting your bureau to convene representatives from both labor and management to attempt mediation, so that a fair solution can be achieved, so as to achieve lasting peace and avoid disputes forever. Society will be fortunate, and the industry will be very fortunate, etc."</p>
<h3>Public Health Society Lecture: "Blood Storage"</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Public Health Society is scheduled to hold its seventh regular meeting at the Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA at 7:15 PM on Thursday, September 5th. At that time, Dr. Yu of the Lester Institute for Medical Research will be invited to lecture on "Blood Storage." In recent years, the medical community has increasingly used preserved blood for transfusions. Various countries in Europe and America have organizations that specialize in "blood storage," and the Shanghai medical community is also planning to hold such an event. Therefore, Dr. Yu's lecture is of great interest to colleagues in the medical community. Those who wish to attend should contact the secretary of the society in advance to reserve a seat.</p>
<h3>Five-Cent Auxiliary Currency Tickets Abound: Genuine and Counterfeit Differ</h3>
<p>Recently, a large number of counterfeit five-cent auxiliary currency tickets have been circulating in Shanghai. According to reporters from the Pingming News Agency, the differences between the counterfeit five-cent tickets and the genuine tickets are as follows: (1) The English at the end of the reverse side of the genuine ticket is (UNION PUBLISHERS &amp; PRINTERS, FED. ING. U.S.A), while the counterfeit ticket says (UNION PRINTING CO., U.S.A.). (2) There is a very small "中" (Zhong/Center) character in the lower left corner of the pagoda image on the front of the genuine ticket, but the counterfeit ticket does not have it. (3) The counterfeit ticket is about two English points narrower than the genuine ticket. (4) The paper used for the counterfeit ticket is very rough. After slight rubbing, it becomes tattered and fuzzy, making it unusable. (5) The pattern on the counterfeit ticket is rough and not as detailed as the genuine ticket. The color is also slightly lighter than the genuine ticket. (6) The numbers on the reverse side of the counterfeit ticket are large and the distance between each number is too close, while the numbers on the genuine ticket are small and the distance is slightly wider. Also, recently issued genuine tickets have English letters on both the left and right ends, which the counterfeit tickets do not have. The above points should be noted. According to a certain gentleman in the banking industry, the number of counterfeit tickets issued is at least 60,000 yuan. Therefore, five-cent tickets have suddenly flooded the city recently.</p>
<h3>Young Man in Western Suit Turns Out to Be a Rat Thief: Illicit Affair with a Dance Hostess in a Hotel, Theft at Night Discovered and Arrested</h3>
<p>Li Lijun (originally named Gu Xiuying), a dance hostess from Peidong at the Yu Qiaqing Road Far Eastern Ballroom, is 22 years old. She married Chen Ziliang early in life and lived with him at 16 Guangyu Lane, Rue Gascoyne, in the French Concession. However, with the cost of living soaring, Chen's meager income made it difficult to support the family. Out of desperation, Li went out to work as a dance hostess to increase her income and maintain the household. Her situation was truly pitiful. However, during her time as a dance hostess, Li met a young man from Hebei named Chen Rong (24 years old). Chen Rong claimed to be a college student. Li, seeing his handsome demeanor, believed it to be true and developed feelings for him. Over time, they entered into a physical relationship, using rooms in hotels for secret liaisons. Little did she know that Chen Rong was neither a college student but actually an experienced thief. He usually considered stealing other people's property as a legitimate occupation and had been sentenced by the court several times. However, Li was completely unaware of this. On the night of August 8th, Chen and Li went to the Nanjing Hotel at 200 Shanxi Road, room 532, for a secret rendezvous. Late at night, Chen climbed over the short wall of the balcony and sneaked into the room of Mr. and Mrs. Lu Hongbin, room 533, next door. Taking advantage of the Lu couple's sleep, he stole a total of 82 yuan in French currency and Japanese currency and a Waltham watch worth 100 gold from the Lu couple's bag without making a sound, and sneaked back to his own room. The next day, the Lu couple discovered the theft and reported it to the Central Police Station, requesting an investigation. It was not until 9:00 PM the day before yesterday that Chinese detectives Wang Jinsheng, Feng Qishan, Zhao Lianbi, and Zhu Wanjun learned of the case and rushed to room 302 of the Continental Apartments on Route Paul Henry in the French Concession, where they arrested Chen. Li was also in the room and was arrested as well. Li used the alias Cheng Gu Shi at the police station. Yesterday morning, they were both taken to the Fourth Criminal Division of the First Special District Court. Police lawyers Jiang Baolian and Fang Fushu requested temporary detention for the defendants for further investigation, as they had committed numerous crimes. After questioning Chen Rong, the court acknowledged his confession of theft and ordered him to be remanded in custody for further questioning in one week.</p>

A large tree on the side of the road was also knocked down. At that time, a rickshaw carrying an old woman, about 60 years old, was being pulled by the rickshaw puller in front of the public bus.

The old woman fell from the rickshaw and was crushed to death on the spot by the wheels of the public bus. The rickshaw puller was also seriously injured. Later, Chinese police arrived and sent the injured rickshaw puller to Guangci Hospital for treatment. His injuries were severe and his life was in danger.

<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Continues to Collect House Tax in Western Shanghai</h3>
<p>The negotiations between the Shanghai Municipal Council and the "Municipal Government" regarding the police authority in the Extra-Settlement Roads Area of ​​Western Shanghai have not yet been resolved. The "Special Police Bureau" that had been agreed upon has not yet materialized. However, regarding the issue of house tax in this area, the Shanghai Municipal Council seems unwilling to give up due to sovereignty concerns. However, last month, it was heard that the residents of Western Shanghai had received a notification from a certain party stating that future house tax should not be paid to the tax collectors of the Shanghai Municipal Council. Reporters inquired with the Shanghai Municipal Council, and the Bureau stated that it believes that the house tax in Western Shanghai is currently still under the jurisdiction of the Shanghai Municipal Council and that there is no reason to give up. As for the residents, owners, and factories in the area, they also have an obligation to pay house tax to the Shanghai Municipal Council. Therefore, the autumn house tax will be collected as usual.

<h3>Buying Long and Selling Short</h3>
<p>Since the practice of buying long and selling short began, defaults have been increasing day by day. Why? Because the matter of speculating on the market is no different from gambling. This house sells a certain amount, and that house sells a certain amount, and it is only determined by a word. However, the number of wins and losses is beyond their control, to the point of family ruin and loss of life. This is why officials must prohibit it. But even if it is prohibited, the money shops that engage in speculation still privately exchange with each other. The stricter the ban, the more rampant this trend becomes. When making market quotes in public, such as a certain shop buying so much silver and a certain shop buying so many foreign dollars, once the purchase is determined, it is either settled in the evening or the next day. This is called a cash transaction. Gradually, they start leaving a tail, and gradually, they short-deliver a certain amount. Over time, it becomes no different from speculation. The buyers buy and the sellers sell, all without cash. After a few days, they settle the total account. Sometimes, the accounts are settled after several periods. They think that they are just trading partners, even without cash inflows and outflows. But in reality, what is the difference from cash, and they do not know that they are clearly violating the ban on speculation. There are also those who have ample wealth and collect cash foreign dollars and cash silver from the market every day, storing it at home without using it. They buy in cash and sell in cash, so who can prohibit them? But they do not know that the more they collect, the less cash there is in the market. The rarer things are, the more valuable they become. The longer they accumulate, the more profit they get. Although this is different from speculation, it is actually what is called monopoly.</p>

<h3>Life is Created by Us</h3>
<p>By O.S. Mardey, Translated by Luo Men</p>
<p>Are you dissatisfied with your success today? This is the harvest of what you planted yesterday. Do you dream of a splendid future? What you plant today, you will harvest in the future. We put some effort into life, and we can get something in life.</p>
<p>Nature moves our mood; she laughs with those who laugh and cries with those who cry. If we are joyful and happy, then the birds sing even better, and the forests and streams seem to sing our songs. But if we are sad or troubled, then unexpected darkness envelops the appearance of nature; the sun shines, but it has nothing to do with us, and the birds sing, but not to us.</p>
<p>The "future" is created according to our will, and our will can determine its nature. A person's decision is a person's prediction. Leave your cowardly pessimism behind, do not predict evil, but good. Those who have hope are always at the front.</p>
<h3>At the Box Office</h3>
<p>— Xin Liang</p>
<p>Through a friend's introduction, I got a clear glimpse of a "box office" in miniature.</p>
<p>Entering a large arena and climbing two flights of stairs, my friend said to me, "This is where I learn to sing opera."</p>
<p>The room wasn't big, and it seemed even narrower due to the large number of people crowded inside. Some people were standing, some were reclining on sofas, some were smoking, and some were chewing melon seeds... Their attitudes were all very relaxed, loose, and without any sense of tension that could be detected by others.</p>
<p>As soon as I stepped into the doorway, I heard a burst of ear-splitting, thunderous applause. At the same time, I heard someone shouting, "Miss Li, you have a truly gifted voice; you sing just like a successor of the Mei School!" I immediately noticed that Miss Li was a young woman of about twenty years old, with a pretty face and a slender figure. What's more, she had the most fashionable hairstyle, wore the latest style of cheongsam, and had a solitaire diamond ring on her hand... all of which made her look like a celestial being!</p>
<p>Then, the sharp sound of the huqin began again. It was Wang Datou's turn to sing "Borrowing the East Wind," and the tea server quickly moved the pre-brewed boiling water in a small green teapot over and placed it on the table next to Wang Datou.</p>
<p>I was completely ignorant of Peking Opera, so my friend took me around the room. I saw that the walls were covered with opera photos, featuring various roles, both male and female, painted faces and clowns. In addition, there were many face masks, red, black, white, and green, which were interestingly contrasted with the pink walls. In a corner of the room, there was a pile of gongs, cymbals, drums, flutes,... and other musical instruments, mixed with horse whips, spears, and broadswords, in considerable disorder.</p>
<p>Finally, we came to a square table. My friend told me, "That old, chubby one is the teacher who teaches female roles here." Around him, I saw countless people practicing their arias and clapping the beat. Everyone's mind was probably filled with fantasies of being on stage in the future, I thought.</p>
<p>Here, we didn't hear a single word of lament or sorrow. The deepest images that entered my eyes and were imprinted on my heart were those of a so-called "peaceful and prosperous" atmosphere. Anyway, those who come here are probably all children of wealthy families. As long as you teach me to sing opera, any sacrifice is acceptable.</p>
<p>They are the happiest people here and now, I envied them.</p>

<h3>The Whereabouts of the Dancing Queen</h3>
<p>— Written by Cheng Xiaoqing</p>
<p>Chapter Six: A Dangerous Experience</p>
<p>Hawthorne nodded. "Your memory hasn't declined with age. This is the person who fired the shot."</p>
<p>Ni Jinshou asked, "Do you recognize this person?" Lei Sang furrowed his brow. "No, I hardly saw his face. That's the point of my failed assessment... Alas! Excessive caution can really ruin things." He casually threw the cigarette butt into the ashtray. I said, "Hey! Go on. What happened after the shooting?" Hawthorne said, "That's where the second coincidence comes in. You can make up for your mistake with this. The lower half of the glass door of the telephone booth is made of wood. Because the door was open, although I was squatting down, I could still see part of the shooter. I saw the person turn around and walk out toward the south gate, with a very relaxed pace, clearly a professional. I quickly stood up, put the phone back on the hook, covered my cheek with a white towel, and walked out of the telephone booth. By this time, I had taken off my coat and was carrying it under my left arm. After I came out of the telephone booth, there were already several idlers and hotel staff gathered around. I casually brushed them off, claiming that I was going to the hospital. The hotel staff clearly wanted to avoid trouble and let me leave through the front door."</p>
<p>"At this time, there were many people going in and out of the front door. I walked to the doorway, covered my face with the towel, and looked around. I saw the person walking onto a car at the right corner. The car happened to be parked behind my car. He thought I had been shot, so his attitude was absolutely relaxed, and he didn't expect that I would follow him. Because of his composure, although many people at the entrance were surprised by the gunshot, they didn't suspect him at all. My attitude naturally had to remain relaxed as well. After his car started, I released my pace and walked to my car, opened the door and jumped in. When my car started, the car in front had already driven quite far, but it had not escaped the limit of my vision. It was a green car!"</p>
<p>Ni Jinshou suddenly raised a hand, indicating that he wanted to interject. "Is it a company car?"</p>
<p>Hawthorne nodded. "Yes, it's a Jiangsheng Company car, license number eight zero eight four four."</p>
<p>"That's easy. We can find out immediately." Ni Jinshou said, writing a few notes in his notebook.</p>
<h3>Gold Bell Cricket</h3>
<p>— Gong Yi</p>
<p>In the silent night, I suddenly heard a chirping sound coming from the next room. It was an autumn insect from the holly trees in our countryside, called the gold bell cricket.</p>
<p>Land in Shanghai is as precious as gold, and there is a lack of open space, let alone flowers and trees. This little insect that we often see is just like mooncakes during the Mid-Autumn Festival, a seasonal item. These days, there are vendors carrying burdens of these little insects being found in various lanes, they especially went to the countryside to capture them, as a seasonal business.</p>
<p>It is said that humans love animals. A kitten is fed milk as soon as it is born, and allowed to grow up in a warm bedroom; a strong dog is locked with an iron chain and made to take gentlemanly walks; even fish that live in the ocean are kept away from the terrifying waves and placed in electrified glass tanks. These little autumn insects are naturally treated the same way, locked in narrow glass boxes from the lush green trees.</p>
<p>However, the result of this love is that the grown-up kitten loses its ability to catch mice and risks starvation if it doesn't get good cat food one day; a strong dog at most sniffs the tips of visitors' feet at the door; the mortality rate of tropical fish is so high that, if there were statistics, it would be very considerable. So, how can the gold bell cricket that is proudly flapping its wings tonight not be the last moment of its life?</p>
<p>But this loving abuse also has its inevitable cause: for example, cats and dogs originally have innate responsibilities. Once they lie in a warm embrace and act gentlemanly, they naturally become toys. As for tropical fish and gold bell crickets, they only please people with their mere beauty and sound, so they are not only toys, but seasonal toys for a moment.</p>
<h3>"Dengue Fever"</h3>
<p>Recently, a rare infectious disease has been prevalent in Songjiang, causing a great stir in the city. Nine out of ten households are ill, and doctors are overwhelmed. This is dengue fever (Dengne). According to the recognition of this disease, it has been around for 150 years. It is almost always prevalent in Egypt and Asia Minor in the summer. In 1928, there was a large-scale epidemic in Greece, with as many as 200,000 patients. The cause of the disease is still unclear, but it is a type of filterable pathogen transmitted by the yellow fever mosquito (Stegomgia Calopus). The incubation period is five or six days, and most have a one- or two-day prodromal period, with a sudden onset of high fever to 39 degrees or higher. The limbs, joints, waist, back, and other areas are extremely sore, and movement is difficult. After one or two days, the fever subsides slightly, and after three or four days, it rises again and develops a red rash. The fever subsides and the rash fades after six or seven days, leaving behind long-term weakness or insomnia. However, there may also be complications such as vomiting, coma, nephritis, and pneumonia. Eight or ninety percent of the residents are infected, but the mortality rate is very low. Even with complications, it is only one or two per thousand, and we rarely see deaths. There is no specific treatment, but attention should be paid to exterminating mosquitoes. Dr. Ke Deqiong</p>
<h3>The Bravery of Jesus Christ (2)</h3>
<p>(3) Opposition to the Class Concepts of Society and Religion at the Time: During the time of Jesus, society and religion in the Jewish nation had an unbreakable and profound class concept, much like India, very unequal. Jesus believed that although humans have differences in intelligence, wisdom, and moral character, their personalities are equal and should not be discriminated against. Therefore, he tried his best to break this class concept, associating with those who were considered sinners at the time, receiving them, and eating and drinking with them at the same table. Someone questioned his disciples, saying, "Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?" When Jesus heard this, he said, "Healthy people don't need a doctor; only the sick do... I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners." (Matthew 9:11-13)</p>
<p>(4) Composure in Dangerous Environments: A person who can remain calm and collected in a dangerous environment, placing life and death out of consideration, this kind of composure is also sufficient to show his bravery. Once, Jesus and his disciples were crossing the sea in a boat, "and behold, there arose a great storm in the sea, so that the boat was being swamped by the waves; but he was asleep. And they went and woke him, saying, 'Save us, Lord; we are perishing!' And he said to them, 'Why are you afraid, O you of little faith?' Then he rose and rebuked the winds and the sea, and there was a great calm." (Matthew 8:23)</p>
<p>Because Jesus has such bravery, Christianity for two thousand years has continued his spirit, fighting against sin. Dear reader! Do you find that sometimes you want to be faithful to the truth but hesitate and shrink back, looking before and after? Have you discovered people's hypocrisy and, although filled with righteous indignation, dare not speak out? The Jews had class concepts, and the Chinese may not be without them. Do you dare to try breaking them from yourself? In an extremely dangerous environment, do you feel flustered, unable to maintain composure, and calmly cope? If you admit it, then it is your weakness, not brave enough. You should quickly turn to our Savior Jesus Christ, who can add to your strength.</p>

<h3>Happy News in Early Autumn: Fei Wenli Remarries, Holds Wedding with Laurence Olivier in California</h3>
<p>— Xin Ying</p>
<p>Because of the success of "Gone With the Wind," British actress Fei Wenli is currently a sensation in Hollywood. According to a dispatch from California on August 30th, this beautiful female star has officially married British actor Laurence Olivier. Here, the author will tell readers about Fei Wenli's marital history and the circumstances of this wedding:</p>
<p>Former Husband Xiao Zhi</p>
<p>In her early years, Fei Wenli, out of love for drama, majored in drama at a drama school in London. It was at that time that she and a young lawyer, Laihuo Ermen (Leigh Holman), fell in love at first sight in social circles, planting the seeds of love, and everything went smoothly. Finally, in the year she was nineteen, the two were married. After marriage, the couple's relationship was also very good. Fei Wenli's name was originally Fei Wen Mali Hatol, but because her husband's name had the word Leigh in it, she shortened the first letters of both their names after marriage, naming herself Fei Wenli. From this, we can see the depth of their love at the beginning!</p>
<p>The Course of the Marital Change</p>
<p>Indeed, after they got married, he loved her very much, and she also loved him. They had a beloved daughter named Shasaini Huoermen, who is now six years old. But good times don't last forever. When Fei Wenli was filming in England, she and Laurence Olivier belonged to the same film company. Because of their profession, they often came into contact, and a spark of love ignited. At the same time, her love with that young lawyer could not be maintained and finally broke down. On the one hand, she divorced her former husband, and on the other hand, she got engaged to her future husband. Her romance continued to spread in the film industry.</p>
<p>Simple Wedding Celebration</p>
<p>On the evening of August 30th, Fei Wenli finally married at the home of a friend of Laurence Olivier in Southern California. The wedding was very simple, and there were only a few guests, because they had not leaked the good news beforehand. That night, female star Katherine Hepburn and Hollywood director Carson Caininggang attended the wedding. After the wedding, the newlyweds went on a honeymoon trip to Northern California the next morning. People in Hollywood are envious of Laurence Olivier's good fortune!</p>

<h3>Chatting About Zhen Lugenrong</h3>
<p>Bald, old, and stupid!</p>
<p>This is an abnormal phenomenon.</p>
<p>Originally, Peking Opera was to perform historical dramas, and shadow plays were to reflect the times. Now, film producers are engaged in producing ancient costume shadow plays, and Peking Opera is instead staging modern realistic materials. The Grand Stage performed "Yan Ruisheng and Wang Lianying" first, and the Co-Stage followed suit with "Huang Huiru and Lu Genrong."</p>
<p>This time, the Co-Stage's performance of "Huang Huiru and Lu Genrong" has two characteristics: one is the hiring of Jin Suwen to play Huang Huiru, and the other is the appearance of the real Lu Genrong on stage. We know that Jin Suwen's thinking has always been different from that of ordinary Peking Opera practitioners. She has a relatively clear mind, so it is appropriate for her to play Huang Huiru, because Huang Huiru in the play is to liberate a free path from the old feudal system. As for the real Lu Genrong's appearance on stage, it is nothing more than to enhance the appeal. He appears very late, in the section where the patrol police arrest Lu Genrong, running out to bow to the audience and saying, "I am the real Lu Genrong. I can't bear to look back on the past twelve years. Now I am doing business..." and then he is done.</p>
<p>Out of curiosity, I went to the stage to meet this so-called real Lu Genrong. His face was very dark, most of his hair was bald, he was wearing a flannel suit, and speaking of beauty, he had less than one-tenth of it, and he was also very stupid, not as good at eloquence as Zhao Ruquan played in the play.</p>
<p>He said: He is already thirty-three years old this year. Since he came out of prison, he once worked as a servant in the Saint Anna Ballroom, and now he has two small shoe repair stalls in the French Concession. Life is not very prosperous.</p>
<p>Finally, the reporter asked him if Huang Huiru was still alive. He did not give a definite answer, except to say that all the people in the Huang family had passed away. Later, he was asked what he thought of the performance of this play. He stupidly answered with an inexplicable laugh.</p>
<h3>Another Column: In Times of Joy, Why Do You Laugh?</h3>
<p>— Lan Yi</p>
<p>What a difficult question, how mysterious! If I answer you by saying, "You laugh because you are born to laugh," would you be satisfied?</p>
<p>This answer, although you may not think it's right, is a true answer. The phenomenon of laughter is determined by how your brain and body are structured. If you are tickled, even if you are not happy, you cannot help but laugh. To explain this is relatively easy. If a strong light suddenly shines into your eyes, you immediately close your eyes. This is also because your brain is structured in this way and wants to teach you to close your eyes like this. Using this theory to answer is indeed a simple method; you have to laugh when you are tickled, it is the same. But one is that you are just handling a small matter, the other is that you are doing many things at the same time. When you see light, you only move the muscles of your eyelids; laughing also moves the muscles you use for breathing, and also moves the muscles for laughing; it is a special action in which many muscles move together. And this is exactly the reaction to being tickled, just like when your feet are scratched, you have to pull them away.</p>
