<h3 id="c13">平粉麥以安米市 <a href="#c13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>米糧操縱之風潮甫平而粉麥操縱之波浪又起，夫操縱已屬不可原諒，況以民食為對象而壟斷牟利耶？殘害民生，貽患社會，自非亟謀制止不可者也。</p>
<p>粉價與米價之比，通常為四比一，有時亦視粉米行市之榮辱而有軒輊，今則婁價不僅與之齊驅，且超越米價而過之，固不能不謂為非常之變。蓋麵粉每袋重量自民國十三年五月由五十磅改為四十九鎊以求適合國際粉量標準以來，約合四十四又百分之四五市斤。依然回籠粉十一元數角之價，折合成每市石之重量，其價在米限價以上，即以廠盤而論，亦與石米之價相差無幾，若非有人為之操縱，粉價何以高昂如是。</p>
<p>至一觀其漲價之由來，麥價最高不過六元五六角。七月下旬形勢漸非，蓋有爭著先鞭，竊事囤積者矣。八月中旬米價將近三十元，粉價亦至六元；下旬米價至三十八九元，麥價至十元，粉價乃至六元四五角。九月中旬粉價一躍而出七元之關。然據九月底調查，存粉尚有二百餘萬包，存麥五十餘萬包，故十月十一月之行市尚平靜；至十一月杪，粉價為七元六角，麥價為十二元二角。一入十二月，米價高至四十七八元，粉價幾無日不漲，及兩租界兩次限制米價，時粉價已高至八元七角。本年一日開市，粉價卽開九元，客盤開九元五角，小麥至十五元半；及至十六日，轟傳既久之十元粉價，竟爾實現。其後廠商殆為避免進干涉起見，故本街至今維持十元原盤：夷考其實，則個中人以大利所在，豈肯多所犧牲，卽三五百包之實銷，亦有拒絕之說，實際上等於有行無市；洋粉且已達十二元，小麥之價，居然售開二十元。夫如此居奇操縱之不已，欲求粉價自趨平落，無此事理也。抑粉麥市價何以必隨米價而亦步亦趨？理非必然，事在人為；蓋操縱米糧之不足，更操縱粉麥，以遂其操縱整個民食之企圖，觀於上述趨勢，情跡顯然；察其大欲，殆欲使維持民食者窮於應付而交交將限價禁令，不廢自馳耳。</p>
<p>尤可見此次突飛猛進，連漲四日，此非鑒於米價已受限制，粉麥卽可為所欲為之證歎！其後競逐步上騰，而見十元之高價。況回籠粉價本此廠盤較小五分至一角之數：及八月中旬，廠方限制開出，遂收買回籠粉，其價反而高出廠盤一二角，最近竟相越一元數角。回籠粉之價，雖曰「野盤」，實際上可視同廠粉之暗盤，明盤不升而暗盤頻漲，此或足以遮掩耳目，顧合維持本市民食之旨耶？夫廠商而果有維持民食之誠意，何以又限制實銷之供應，驅之而使不得不求諸回籠粉。抑所謂回籠粉者，悉憑廠方之一紙棧單，在廠方雖可諉之於棧單買賣乃客家事，而個中「巧開」，撲明迷離，孰能明其究竟。且廠方之舉措，更有不能使人無疑者，倐而限制生產，倏而恢復原車，又倐而限制客銷，待一經漲價，則仍供給如常；如此先操後縱，理極矛盾，而利在其中；今則不僅限制客銷，又限制街銷，復有迫令客商出清棧單之說，夫既經限制客銷，何以粉麥之價不平而反漲；則所謂限制供應，非居奇之明證，出清棧單，非抬價之先聲乎？故市上盛傳廠家將以麥價昂漲為理由，洋麥難定作煙幕,欺朦大眾，以為將來繼續漲價之張本。另一方面，以棧單為工具，壓迫棧單之結果，使客家無力出貨，終必出於解約一途，則物歸故主，力能出貨，則一經銷售，市上可少此一筆存貨，縱使平一時之價，但後此抬價出售，可無顧忌。亦有謂本市尚有少數洋粉流通，故欲乘此廠粉關住之際，轉使客幫吸收洋粉，及洋粉既盡，則滬市所有，只為少數之本廠粉及東洋粉，屆時壟斷居奇，則莫敢奈何，亦無法奈何，凡此種之傳說固末可盡信，然證以交易所時代，廠家操縱標准粉，百出其技，則今當米貴時候，自是大好之操縱機會，而不思操縱，有是理耶！況事實所昭示，固已明顯異常矣。</p>
<p>又有謂南人食米，粉價貴，其影響尚微。實則粉與米，同佔上海民食中之最要部分；上海大部分住戶及職工，每於清晨午夜，多以麵食點饑；平時之間用麵食者亦眾，米貴後更甚；故粉麥之為重要民食，初不限於北人為然，且如油條大餅，幾可謂為最普遍最大眾化之食物，今則大餅薄如錢，油條細如繩，必數倍舊值，始足以療饑；於以見操縱粉價所威協一般民食之嚴重可知。蓋米經限價及兩工部嚴厲取締之後，雖暗中力事破壞者，頗有其人，但已不敢公然操縱，而粉麥固猶活躍自如也。因此之故，往日粉價固隨米價而步趨，今則米價反隨粉麥而暗漲，不觀近來米市曾有一度以高粳售限價，最近又以蘇同粳為標準；夫以中粳當高粳而售限價，謂非破壞而何，謂非漲價而何？故有謂操縱粉麥正為其不得志於米糧，今將米粉麥打成一片，不第聲勢愈大，亦且互相牽動，明漲暗升，彼唱此和，民食尚有安定之日耶！</p>
<p>然則目前之計，仍惟限制粉價之途是循乎？曰然，而亦不盡然。夫欲維持限價，須有根絕暗盤之決心。根絕暗盤，實行限價，又非管理市場注意分配不為功。蓋限價僅可濟一時之急，非可作持久之圖。而默察大勢，糧食前途之波蘭尚多，正以操縱糧食，豈虛聲恫嚇人者可比，皆有所憑藉，具有實力，是以歷來之處理民食者，阻礙橫生，破壞百出，良由此故。至於粉市管理，較易於米，以其為機制品，產銷易於平准，成本不難稽核。關於麥之來源，為目前計，澳麥已有所定成，美國且將消納其二千五百萬剩麥，有津貼運銷中國香港菲列賓之說。誠如此，不難有助於中國之民食。夫平粉麥即反以安米市，安米市正所以全民生，租界當局為數百萬人福利是謀，當能繼續有所措施，以慰民望，是所翹企待之者也。</p>

<p>（三）要偽組織先承認「滿洲帝國」而後中國領土主權由日滿來尊重、試想承認了偽滿、還說是尊重中國領土及主權、而中國領土和主權還要由宰割出雲的偽滿傀儡來尊重、這是戲弄呢、還是侮辱呢、</p>
<p>（四）不但宣傳與教育、就是政治外交和貿易、足以破壞相互好誼者，不獨現在、即將來亦禁絕之、換一句話說、中國境內凡有不便於日本者、一概永遠禁絕之、</p>
<p>（五）對於第三國關係、不採取違反相互提攜的基調之措置、這就叫中國的外交權從此整個聽命於日本、不許有自由獨立之餘地、這是不是完全夷中國於日本的附庸、此外還要派遣顧問於「新中央政府」、於強度結合地帶及其他特定區域、這就是要對中國層層配置監視人員</p>
<p>（六）協力於文化融合與創造、這就是從此不許中國有獨立的文化、不許中國人在文化上自己有創造、</p>
<p>（七）再看所謂「共同防衛」事項之內所載的、不僅是「共同防共」、還要協力於共通治安的維持、這共通的治安」的新名詞、就是要把整個中國變為日兵駐防區域的注解、就是駐兵於全中國任何地點的張本、</p>
<p>（八）於是說到「防共」、就圖窮匕見的說、要駐兵於華北於蒙古各要地、於是還要結成防共軍事同盟、於是還須中國承認中艦船部隊得在長江沿岸特定地點、和華南島嶼長期停泊、因為這些地點離日人的假想敵蘇聯太遠了、不能應用到「防共」二字上來、所以在上文要製造共通的治安之維持的一句話來應用、而駐兵區的鐵道航空通訊主要港灣水道、日方還保留著軍事上的「要求權」和「監督權」、至於中國本國之軍警配置、和軍事設施要限至最少程度、而且這個最少程度、而且這個最少程度的軍警建設、還要由日本派遣顧問協力行之、試問什麼是協力、監視而已、支配而已、</p>
<p>（九）再看看所謂經濟提攜的內容怎麼樣、首先是要互助連環、其次還要「經濟結合」、整個掠奪中國的經濟、甚至中國財政經濟政策、乃至關稅和海關制度之建立、都要受他的支配、受他的限制、受他的統制、</p>
<p>（十）關於資源開發、關於關稅交易、關於航空交通通訊、和氣象測量、均要以便利日本的援助協力、和物質需給的主旨、締結所要之協定、</p>
<p>（十一）資源的開發和利用、在華北內蒙要與日本以特殊的便利、又在其他地域關於特定資源、也要給日本以所要之便利、而其所謂全國交通協力之重點、乃包括整個中國之航空、華北（包含隴海線在內）之鐵道、中日之間及中國沿海之海運、長江水運、及華北與長江下流之通訊等等、</p>
<p>以上種種、就是日本要將中國所有的一切囊括以盡、連我們同胞人人的食衣住行都要受他日本的支配、而毫無自由的餘地、上述各項、他們還恐未能列舉完備、在備考欄內、更規定須與日方農密切協議、以為隨時要索的張本、除此雙外、還有規定偽中央與南京華北、及蒙疆三傀儡組織的關係、內容甚為瑣細、而其主要精神、無非是一塊塊　割開來、便其吞嚼、</p>
<p>最足令人注目者、便是廈門與瓊州島、特別各列為一條、廈門要設為特別行政區域、而「海南島」上要承認日本之特殊地位、使之有權處理航空通訊海運之事項、和國防（必需資源之開發利用事項、這還不是乾脆的說、廈門與瓊州島要是永久割讓於日本就完了麼、而其沒有明舉、還有所謂華南沿海特定之島嶼、我們須注意這就是日本決心掀起太平洋上的風雲、而要以我神聖禹域之資源、黃帝子孫的血肉、作他南進北進冒險並舉的資本、</p>
<p>綜觀這一個密約、較之民國四年日本向袁世凱所提出的二十一條、不知要廣泛毒辣到多少倍、這個條件如果見之於實行、中國就陷於萬刦淪亡、四萬萬五千萬黃帝子孫真無噍類、而東亞與世界的禍害、更不知伊於胡底、可是汪兆銘竟競於雲年亥（十二月）陷（三十）欣然簽字、在這個密約上、請問全國同胞這是和平呢、還是「國交調整」呢、還是亡國條件呢、幅度這個條件的實行中國的獨立自由是可以由此確保呢、還是從此永遠斷送淨盡呢、</p>
<p>尤其令人痛憤的，請全國同胞再看一看汪兆銘在他向日方提出的「新政府成立前所急望於日方者」一個文件中、以所認為「中央政府成立之必具條件」是什麼、對於國家民族生死存亡的領土主權行政等等、他以為都可以不管、而所爭者乃是四千萬元款項之借支、以及關稅之存放、與統稅鹽稅之轉移、明白的說、汪兆銘向日人所要求的、有了錢就可以一概不爭、此外他所要求者、就是開放南京上海間長江之一段、再其次是京滬間的通行證問題、和憲警檢查權、以為有此數項、便可保障他個人的安全、他要求長江開放、何嘗是來為欺騙英美諸國、要求通行證和憲警權、何嘗更有其他目的、實在是準備不得了時、他可以從海上陸上脫走、</p>
<p>所以除此而外、便一概可以不爭、祇是對於這兩點一定要低聲下氣、向日人請求、還美其詞曰要「變更人民觀感、改善人民心理」、你看他拿我們同胞當作什麼人、可是日本方面怎麼答覆他呢、日方最後的答覆、是很簡單的、就是動用四千萬元一層、必須日支新關係調整之原則、及其他過渡辦法、得到確約時、則有設法以副尊意的準備、其他對於關稅收入、還是仍舊要存放正金銀行、而華北及內蒙部分、還要加以保留、關於長江開放、是拒絕了、關於通行證與憲警檢查、要待適應洽安狀況等現地之實情、而由日支雙方之關系宜憲協議再定、我們要注意日人所謂（得到確約一句話、就日方要汪簽訂了、（日支新關係調整要綱）條件、給了他永不反悔的保障、　過付這四千萬元的款項、我們由此可以知道、汪所以要在十二月三十日滿盤承諾的緣故了、我們由此可以知道、十一十二月間、上海某種報紙傍徨焦急、裝腔作態的內幕了、</p>
<p>祇看這幾個文件、已不必待我再加闡明了、我祇是提醒現在還有極少數過於忠厚、專以君子之心度小人之腹的同胞們、不免迷惑於汪過去的煙幕彈的、讀了這幾件從他自己內幕裏揭出來的文件之後、請問作何感想、</p>
<p>這一年以來、日本國內部由近衛而平沼、由平沼而阿部、由阿部而米內、換來換去脫了少壯軍人的掌握、現昨日本新閣登場、米內的首次談話、是要援助（新中央政府）的產生、而劈頭第一誤、卻是　請「全國有一致團結、以健立東亞新秩序的必要」這可以看出日本政界和民間都有不一致的實情、可以知道日本之內、也還存在著不少頭腦清楚的分子、知道這樣滅人國家的狂妾企圖、必陷日本身身於滅亡的、無論少壯軍閥是怎樣的蒙上欺下、畢竟掩不住日本內部的矛盾、與不一致、可是這一個不一致並不關於傀儡政權的成敗、我在幾個月前、早經斷定偽組織是遲早要出現的、我又說、「無論敵人製造幾十個偽組織、無論這種偽組織、假借任何名義、吾人只認為日本之奴隸、其對內對外、決不發生絲毫效用、也決不能損害我黨國於毫末、」</p>
<p>我們今天是抗戰第一、四萬五千萬同胞定決心、保障中華民國的獨立生存、任何力量、任何詭謀、絕對亡不了我們中國、可是這一次汪方文件的披露、畢竟是有重要的意義、如果不是他的內部有人發動天良、把這個密約、公布於世、我可斷定、不論日人和傀儡如何要遮掩其全部、或者至少部、汪還要繼續著對我們一般忠厚同胞、用花言巧語、不斷的來欺騙、現在這個密約、何時遞交、何時簽字、何時帶回東京、以及日閥如何　指氣使的脅迫、一切都很明白了、汪和日閥雖欲抵賴、也無從抵賴、雖欲改竄掩飾、看他又如何改竄掩飾、（待續）（二十三日電）</p>

<p>米價預測　（一）因種種關係、上海米價、或有續漲之可能、深望各界人士能於尙未續漲之際、儘速大量採購、以爲木雨綢繆之計、則日後食米恐慌、或可不致發生、（二）深望各工廠商店學校、以及其他團體機關、皆能爲其所屬之員工、墊款採購六個月以上之存米、（西貢米可放存二年不爛）所有墊款、得於其薪工項下、分別繼續扣還、如此辦法、對於工廠等本身、並無多大損失、而於全體員工、却有安心操作之益、欲求勞資合作、實爲取好時機、不僅如此、上海至少有三分之二人口、係屬上述範圍以內者倘在此六個月中對於食米皆可無憂、則上海民食問題、業已解決大半、而其餘三分之一人口、亦以市上食米需要大减、米價無從高漲、不致再吃貴米、則整個民食問題、豈非完全解決之乎、（三）各界如能自動湊集成數、直接向外洋訂購、本會亦極端贊同、蓋本會只望能使上海存米之增加、而絕無包攬各界代訂洋米之企圖、惟其中猶有不得不提及者、即深望各界勿在上海就地大量採購、蓋在上海採購、不但不能使上海之存米增加、而且反使上海之存米日趨緊縮、而於貧苦吃升斗者、將有莫大之威脅、此不可不注意者也、（四）深望各業同業公會、皆能與本會合作、勸導各該會員商店、能一致明瞭日後民食問題之嚴重、及影響各該行業之鉅大、應當機立斷、積極採取集團購米之辦法、</p>
<p>訂米問答　（五）爲使各界更能明瞭集團購米辦法起見特將一般問訊事項、擇要答復於後、（問）爲何要訂購洋米、（答）因種種關係、國米來源不暢、故只得忍痛訂購洋米、以裕來源、（問）洋米有幾種、（答）因交通關係、木會目前暫擬只訂西貢米一種、惟西貢米亦分等級、頭號米每百粒中僅有碎米二十五粒、米色潔白、爲嚴高等米、二號米每百粒中有碎米四十粒、供普通食用、三號米每百粒中有碎米六十粒、及頭二號合摻碎米一種、大　供貧苦、或勞動階級者用、本會因近委託訂購頭號米及碎米者、不易積有成數、以便躉批向外洋訂購、故爲簡便計、現只代訂二號西貢米一種、此種米供中等階級人士食用、最爲相宜、（問）洋米合若干元一石、（答）因市價常有上落、父外滙日有不同、故必須俟登記集有成數、正式決定訂購時、方有正式價格、本會計已代訂西貢米兩批、第一批六千包、每包約合一石二斗五、價四十三元八角三分、第二批一萬包、每包四十八元八角三分、每市石第一批每石的合三十五元、第二批每石的合二十九元、但袋一隻、照市尙可售得二元左右、又運送上棧力錢保險費等的計每包一元叫角左右、（問）照目前情形而論、訂購洋米、並未便宜、（答）因上海現有存米、尙係前時所定、其時進價較低、故售價亦廉、但此項存米有限、一旦售完、即有問題、本會有鑒於此、故望各界儘速訂購、以爲凖備、目目前外滙未大縮、訂購時機極佳、倘將來外滙緊縮、則縱使米價不漲、但另加外滙差額、亦必較此時昂貴、（問）現在上海米價旣廉、則何小儘向上海採購、（答）因向上海就地採購、並不能使上海存米增加、而且反使上海存米緊縮、前已言之甚詳、故不僅爲本會所不取、亦盼各界所不爲、（問）訂購洋米之手續如何、（答）訂米者（一）應先赴本會（香港路五十九號三樓三零四號房間）、塡具申請書、然後赴江西路金城銀行信託部、預付每包定洋二十元、作爲正式登記、（二）本會俟登記集有相當成數、乃代向外洋訂購、其訂購時間、通常的爲三星期、（三）一俟定米到滬、本會即代爲上棧、並通知訂米者、隨帶定洋收據、至金城銀行信託部繳足全包米價、領取棧單出貨、（問）民食調節協會向每定戶另取手續費吾、（答）絕對不取分文、完全義務代勞、每批訂購、帳目公開、完全依照來價成本、分給各定戶、至於本會理事委員司庫秘書幹事全係義務職、另用二三書記、薪水極小、其他開支亦極少、刻下可以支持若干月、母庸向任何方面請求補助、已由本會熱心人士捐助一千五百元、</p>
<p>基金效用（問）民食調節協會何以要籌集基金、（答）因本會必須有相當基金、方能達到眞正調節之目的、例如、（一）米價低落時得用基金買進、高漲時照常賣出、則可收平衡米價之效、（二）遇定戶不足成數時、而米價適於此時下落、或正値外匯好轉、倘有基金、即可預爲訂購、或預結外匯、以爲準備、（三）每决訂米、因種種關係、以大批整購較爲便利、倘有基金、則定戶雖有畸零包數、本會即可湊足整數訂購、總之、基金之效用甚多、雖不及一一列舉、然即此數點、亦巳顯見其重要、故深望各界已經認繳者、請從速交來、其求認定者、亦盼踴躍參加、况基金不過用作一時周轉之籌碼、將來仍得照章發還、其與一般捐款性質、故亦大有區別者也、上海民食調節協會啟、父不敷分配、故當時海關當局特破例招考日籍關員、全數共計三－餘人、以適應此項需要、據記者昨向海關探悉、目前日員已較前多出三倍、增添至百數十人、均派往該處工作、至戰前在楊樹浦·浦東·等處執行緝私職務、及一部份自內地撒滬之華籍關員、現均派在租界內沿黃浦及蘇州河各碼頭照常執行職務、</p>

<h3 id="c47">昨日開放的三處鐵門巡禮 <a href="#c47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>— 揚子江</p>
<p>自從死守南市的孤軍，揮淚退出了這古老而具有歷史性的南市以後，法租界通南市的幾道鐵門，亦就關閉起來。二年多以來，這幾道銹蝕的冷酷的鐵門，已成了畸形繁榮和特殊悽凉的兩個不同世界的鴻溝了。</p>
<p>去年十一月十一日起，新開河自來水塔南首的封鎖鐵絲網架，開始實行開放以後，共餘各鐵門開放的空氣，便甚囂塵上。直到昨日，法租界東區昆連南市的斜橋·南陽橋（即敏體尼蔭路盡頭）。和新橋街三處鐵門，終於同時實行開放了。</p>
<p>鐵門兩旁本來是堆置着許多鐵絲網，以及沙袋土丘等障碍物的，到咋天上午十時許，由法租界的巡捕，和在南市的日本憲兵設法搬掉，並將鐵門開啟，分列成兩個通行缺口；一邊是從南市到租界來的「進口」，另一邊是從租界到南市去的「出口」。中間佈置着鐵絲網架，通行的居民便在這兩邊進出。</p>
<p>法租界方面，在每道鐵門旁派駐了十幾個探捕和女檢查員，對從南市進入租界的居民探疑施行檢查。鐵門外則站立着相等的日本憲兵和偽警，苛嚴地檢查通過鐵門的居民。並紀錄進出的人數，對所持的偽「市民證」，檢視得允爲苛細。但是從前在新開河禁止通行的十月·十一月·十二月三月份僞「市民證」，昨天在新開啟的三處鐵門却可以通過。</p>
<p>刦後南市，荒凉異常，昨天更因爲是第一天開啟的緣故，所以進出的居民，並不十分擁擠。他們大部份還是到南市去探視刦後的故居，一部份則是蟄處在南市的難民，乘機到租界來偶遊的。同時，在新橋街東首同仁輔元堂對出的鐵門，亦於昨日開啟，不過還攔着一條鐵鏈，只供車輛通行，可是進出的車輛却是寥寥無幾。</p>
<p>南市開闊的中華民國路，兩旁的商店依然緊閉着牌門，情形是非常荒凉，有幾處斷垣殘瓦的空塲，已經日方修葺掩飾一空。</p>
<p>近日南市各地房屋，多已租賃一空，並且在九畝地一帶還有許多「俱樂部」和「樂園」在動工興築，第二個「歹土」，或者就要在這裏出現。</p>

<p>江海關自前年六月起、恢復虹口·楊樹浦·沛東等處緝私工作後、因華籍關員在特殊環境之下、不便前往該處執行職務、而西籍緝私員海關中爲數極少、又不數分配、故當時海關當局特破例招考日籍關員、全數共計三十餘人、以適應此項需要、據記者昨向海關探悉、目前日員已較前多出三倍、增添至百數十人、均派往該處工作、至載私職務、及一部份自內地撤滬之華藉關員、現均派往租界內沿黃浦及蘇州河各碼頭照常執行職務、</p>

<h3 id="c85">秀才出門去！ <a href="#c85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>— 黃嘉音</p>
<p>『秀才不出門，能知天下事。』</p>
<p>把這一句話拿來做報紙或雜誌的廣吿，也許是很巧妙的，可她這一句話不知誤了多少中國現代的『秀才』。</p>
<p>坐在舒舒服服的沙發上，翻翻報，看看雜誌，的確是可以知道一點大下的大事的。可是生活在二十世紀的社會上，對於天下事情，單單『知道』是不够的，我們應該有更深入的觀察，更明確的理解，我們應該能够加以分析與解釋。要曉得現社會歷史的趨向，單單知道一點事實是種對不够的。</p>
<p>物價漲了，平民的生活更苦了，於是現代的『秀才們便之乎也者地做了不少感慨的文章。題材是好的，文筆也不錯，祇她往往寫得不够動人，不够深刻。</p>
<p>這是爲了甚麼呢？我說也許是因爲『秀才不出門』的關係，以致對於平民的生活，有點隔膜。</p>
<p>要明白天下大勢，要認識社會的面目，要決定歷史的趨向，我們的秀才們便得出門去，去參觀工廠，監獄，去訪問貧民窟，收容所，要「不恥下問」，去跟碼頭工，報童，排字工人，黃包車夫，以及共他任何做社會最基本的下層工作的同胞們談話，這樣的秀才才眞眞能知天下事。</p>

<h3 id="c86">監犯大學 <a href="#c86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>— 溫和</p>
<p>一月廿日自由談云：「…………像現在這樣不分皂白地把所有的「社會罪人」都關在一起，關到「刑滿」就放出來，以後的生死都由他去了，這豈不是有類乎掩耳盜鈴的舉動？」可是世界上關心監犯幸福的監獄也有，像這裏所介紹的南非聯邦普里托里亚中央監獄便是。</p>
<p>這座監獄是南非聯邦唯一監禁長期徒刑的歐籍犯人的。監獄當局爲了要使監犯們利用他們長期的監禁時閒，特供給他們進修教育的機會。犯人在監獄中可以讀書，可以讀函授學校，監獄裏也聘有教員，犯人可以去聽他們的課。</p>
<p>他們的目的是要去參加外面大學的公開入學考試和學位考試。有一個關七年的犯人，在牢獄中考取了入學考試，現在在牢獄中讀學位了。還有一個也她關七年的，他已經有了文學士的銜頭，還經核准讀商科的功課，他希望過了兩年，能够取得商科的學位。</p>
<p>犯人只有中學程度的，就孜孜的想求大學入學考試的派司。幾個犯欺詐罪的犯人，都在攻讀行政和商業的功課。有一個因殺人放火搶刦偷竊而被判七年徒刑的犯人，他的第一個目的是要考取入學考試，以後還想在監獄中研究礦科和工科呢。</p>
<p>這座監獄自行了這個辦法以來，秩序大見進步。準備考試的犯人都肯遵守獄規，舉止上比較的循規蹈矩。可是求學免不了要錢，許多犯人雖有志向事，然而不免要受到經濟困難的阻撓。『囚犯福利基金」上可以供給一部份的補助，外面也有人捐款，但總還不够。這種辦法的最大阻礙還是余錢問題。</p>
<p>犯人雖然讀書，普通的監獄工作仍舊要做。他自上午七時出獄做工，要到下午五時才返獄。中間有一段中飯時間，許多犯人都好好的利用這一些空功夫。監獄當局對於讀書犯人，也有優待的辦法。普通夜裏九時才熄燈，犯人要在囚室中用功，時間方面也是綽有餘裕的了。</p>
<p>這種辦法行來很好，而且顯然的犯人很得益。普里托里亞中央監獄木是全球管理最好的監獄之一，現在他們正在努力設法替他們有資格的出獄犯人謀得合適的職業。</p>

<p>— 史雙</p>
<p>厭惡納粹之又一羣</p>
<p>氣候暖和，風光秀麗，一山一湖，都存在着逗人迷戀的魅力，那是歐洲的樂園－－瑞士，也是世界人士理想中的安樂鄉，她是世界上唯一永久中立國，和平，穆靜，美麗常充塞着這一個小國，可是當二次歐戰爆發以後，在去年九月五日，瑞士也怪迅速地宜佈全國總動員了，雖說她是個永久的中立國，但她也是個舉國皆兵的國家，鎗，鐵帽，軍裝等都安放在每個人的家庭裏的，所以無綫電一報吿政府的召集令，人民便穿上軍裝飛也似的去報到，集合時間殺短的部隊，祗僅費二小時半吧了。她現在動員了五十萬軍士，這數目在別國當然並不算龐大，但在瑞士却已佔全國人口的百分之十二·五了；她的主力軍集中在西北端的巴塞爾這是與德，法，國境相接的都市，萊茵河的有岸有德國，左岸有法國，瑞士橫跨着萊茵的兩岸，假使德法兩軍都厭惡馬奇諾，齊格斐的正面衝突，那來她們非越過荷萊，比利士或是突破南方的巴塞爾不可了。</p>
<p>在瑞士四百萬人口之中，有十分之七說德語，十分之二說法語，說意大利語和瑞士土語的僅佔十分之一吧了，照推測起來，對於德國該是非常親暱的了，可是意外地，自從去歲德國併吞捷克以來，瑞士完全變成反德的惑情了，她的軍隊集中巴塞爾，一方面是從反德的情感出發，另一方面因爲德國是有侵入瑞士的可能，所以很明顯地軍事防備的主要目的，是完全對付納粹國家的。</p>
<p>瑞士動員的兵士們每二一星期有一次休假，從國境地帶歸來，此刻瑞士的街上，隨處都可見到草色的軍裝，每個士兵一天要費十個瑞士法郞，動員了五百萬兵士的瑞士，每天得用去五百萬法郞，去年瑞士每人的軍備負擔費是一百法郎，現在，可要四百五十法郞了，而另一方面因爲動員了人口十分之一以上的綠故，生產能力不得不大大减弱，所以一般瑞士的小資產階級也在焦頭爛額之中。</p>
<p>世界各國的存金總數，瑞士僅决於美，英兩國，她是全球聞名的「銀行國」。現在他們已將一部份存金移轉到美國去，一部份，則貯藏在山中的隧道裏，而且隧道的附近築了許多掩蔽物，使人根木不會想到這底下有燦爛的黃金，同時他們還將食料放在鐵甲車裏，將鐵甲車沉於散在各地的湖沼中央，以備未來的糧食恐慌。</p>
<p>拒絕記者入國</p>
<p>到現在爲止，瑞士已經發布百五十餘條戰時法令，其中很多是關於取締間諜的，第一次大戰時代，瑞士簡直成了各國間諜暗躍的中心，這是一種足以妨礙中立的情事，所以瑞士現在厲行着電訊，常話，無綫電等通訊統制，外國人入國也更嚴格的限制，瑞士地圖是一概不准携帶的，上决大戰當時，各國閒諜都假了新聞記者的名義混入瑞士，所以這决歐戰中，瑞士毫不留情地拒絕一切新聞肥者入國，瑞士木她個民主政治的自由之邦，如今由於戰爭也變成爲一個不自由的國家了。</p>

<h3 id="c89">心地建設 <a href="#c89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>— 吳問賓</p>
<p>明朝時候，有一個劾嚴嵩的楊繼盛，曾說過這樣幾句話：「心爲人一身之主，如樹之根，如果之蒂，最不可先壞了心，心裏若存天理，存公道，行出來便都是好事，便是君子這邊的人。心裏若存的人欲，是私意，雖欲行好事，也有始無終，雖要外面做好人，也被人看破，如根衰則樹枯，蒂壞則果落。」這話對於心地奸詐的人眞是一針見血之言，我們要做一個正正方方的人，首先須將心地建築得正大坦白，才配做一個眞正的人。</p>
<p>從前北平有個大學生，在一家洋行裏當職員，暗中却去做綁匪，撕了肉票，案發被拘，判處死刑，遣書囑其妻說：「我的犯罪我的死，都是受聰明所累，我兒將來望勿送他上學，以免蹈我覆轍。」這是多麼荒謬！聰明那裏悮了他？我說倒是他自己悮了聰明，你旣有了聰明，就要能駕馭聰明，利用聰明，何以反錯用了聰明呢？這無疑地是他缺乏內心的修養，換言之，就她缺乏心地建設，所以會釀成這種錯覺的慘劇！孫中山先生說：「革命須先革　」一種是對症下藥，我　要　人、　　　先將心地下一　　　　　　　的建設，始不爲一般邪說邪欲念所誘感。</p>
<h3 id="c90">隔膜 <a href="#c90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>— 郭子青</p>
<p>根沒有形跡的線把人們串在一槐兒了。社會科學家如此說。但，我却頗驚異於人和人感情閒距離的遙遠。一個心靈與另一個心靈像一個星球跟別一個星球。永不相通。（我不到聯系的工具。）</p>
<p>於是我說：「隔膜是世界上一種無可奈何的存在。」</p>
<p>「不對，你這看法太悲觀了。」朋友反駁說。「首先你得取下自己那副有色眼鏡來。」</p>
<p>「那麼，你能吿訴我什麼是溝通人和人之問的橋樑嗎？」</p>
<p>「沒有別的，就是生活。你不能單單尋找偶然來塑鑄一個結論。不過時閒與空問倒常把人們隔膜了。」</p>
<p>我又跌入無言的沉思裏。</p>

<p>德國有好幾百頭巨獸，都裝運到俄國去了。這些巨獸原來都是在德國動物園裏的，現在德國人怕牠們餓死，所以把牠們寄養到俄國去了。</p>
<p>英國每人都有一套政府所發給的防毒面具。可是小孩們見了防毒面具，覺得很可怕，政府當局因此特爲製造了大批新式面具，專門分發給兩歲左有的小寳寳。這種面具的顏色有好幾種，樣子很像米老鼠，所以它的名字也就叫做「米老鼠面具」。現在所成爲問題的，就是要孩們不肯正經地戴着，他們當它是玩具了。</p>
<p>英國有兩處地方，都發現「活鬼」。這輩活鬼都在燈火管制熄燈後出現，身穿白袍，嘴中怪叫，恐嚇行人，婦孺們因此嚇得生病的，頗有人在。這些活鬼，大的是當地的惡少無賴裝扮的，警務當局已着手查緝，對於他們的惡作劇，一定不加寬恕。</p>
<p>戈林上將據說最喜佩帶勳章，可是最近德國新發一批勳章，却沒有戈林的份。這種勳章是希特勒專門獎勵建造「西綫長城」（即齊格菲防綫）有功人員的，受獎的一共有文武官員六名。</p>

<p>— 新亮</p>
<p>在守迅君的「實行布衣運動」一文中我讀到了這兩句話：一般年靑的及少奶奶式的影迷，都異常注意電影演員的服裝從而效允。的確，我們每一個人都不會否認，電影對於觀衆所發生的影響，實在是太深太鉅了。不但在服裝上，可以說是如此，即使在其他仟何舉動，嗜好或個性方面，電影也能給我們以絕大的影響。</p>
<p>據去年某月份的美國“Curreut　History”（現代史料）雜誌言：紐約城中的男女靑年，即使是孩子們，都對電影發生極大的興趣，他們允其高興學那些紅明星的樣，穿他們所穿的服裝，燙他們所燙的髪型，幷且還愛他們所愛的一切。</p>
<p>自從瑙瑪希扮中演「鑄悄』一片後，紐約的每家理髪館與美容院都競相以瑙瑪在該片中所梳的「朱麗葉」髪式號召；當克勞黛考　白的「舞宮風月」開映之後，那些瘋在的男女郤又將興趣移到「莎莎」的上來了。同樣地，衣飾也是這樣，米高梅的女人』中的新奇艷服，眞不知轟動了多少的靑年呢。</p>
<p>據說，自從『羅賓漢」一片開映後，紐約城中各文具店里的弓箭玩具生意，就意外地好了起來。除此之外，我們不是在百貨公司中常常看到什麼「秀蘭鄧波兒洋囡囡』，「白雪公主肥皂」『賣花女香水』…之類的東西嗎？隨便什麼物品，只要一冠上電影或明星的名字，它的生意，就會自然而然地興隆起來的。</p>
<p>我們大概還可以聽到『因爲　米蓋羅納是喜歡打球的，所以我也歡喜打球』等等的說話吧，總之，電影的確能够改變一个人的的生活，嗜好。</p>
<p>唯其如此，我們在拍攝每張影片的時候，就要非常地留心，即使是一個極小的動作，極不緊要的一段，他們也必須要使它盡善盡美而後已。</p>

<p>— 元固</p>
<p>美國女作家米契爾女士轟動世界的名小說「隨風而去」（Gone　With　theWind）已銷一百七十八萬多本，譯成了十六國文字，而且根據這部小說的電影，也已經在美國獻映了。</p>
<p>這部電影獻映地點是在喬治亞州亞脫郞太城的大光明戲院，時間是去年十二月十五日。那天主演該片的明星克拉克蓋博爾，費雯莉，李思廉霍華，奧麗薇哈佛蘭等等結隊游行全城，所以亞脫郞太城和喬治亞全州人民都爲　了這部片子興奮得如醉如在。</p>
<p>這部片子是名製片家大衛塞爾士尼克傾全力攝製的，他在　九三六年七月以五萬元美全代價購得隨風而去」的攝製權。那個時候，這木小說還剛問世。攝製權是有了，可是裏面的主要角色該是那些人來扮演呢？克拉克蓋博爾飾演雷脫白脫勒（Rhett　Butler）角，是影迷一致同意認爲　再適合也沒有的，可是女生角史嘉蘭喔哈拉（Scarlett　O’Hara）一角，可就難尋了，好些演員都不適合，最後英國女星費雯莉游好萊塢，給塞爾士尼克看見，才把她延聘下來。</p>
<p>這片子的導演，也是很難物色的。先請的是喬治寇格，這位先生是「茶花女」「鑄情」「女人」的導演，手法方面，細膩有餘，而氣魄不足，接着換了個維多茀萊敏—「怒海餘生」「綠野仙　一的導演，可是他同女主角費雯種莉感情不好，二人時常吵嘴，所以也不能長久的擔任下去。最後請了「萬世師表」的山姆胡特，方才能把這片完成。</p>
<p>本片全部五彩，共耗資三百九十八萬元美金，影史上耗資如此之多的，只有過二部：一是空戰片「地獄天使」一是猶太歷史片「亡國悵」（一譯「賓漢」），據美國民意測騐結果，本片賣座一定能打破「白雪公主」的記錄。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Japanese Reinforcements for Baotou Aim to Invade Wuyuan <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>The Japanese forces in the Wuyuan-Baotou area, following the previous attack by Chinese troops into Baotou city, engaged in fierce street battles for several days, annihilating the main force of the Japanese army and inflicting heavy damage. The Japanese were filled with shame and anger. Since the middle of this month, they have gathered Japanese troops from various areas in northern Suiyuan and southern Shanxi, gradually concentrating them around Baotou. The so-called commander-in-chief of the Japanese garrison in Mengjiang also rushed to Baotou to personally command, attempting to launch another full-scale invasion towards Wuyuan and Linhe. The victorious Chinese forces in this area have long been aware of the Japanese situation and are preparing to defend against them. It will be difficult for the Japanese to succeed.

<p>Fancheng: Over 20,000 Japanese troops, who were determined to advance north into Suixian, engaged in fierce battles with the Chinese in the Tongbai Mountains, Gao City, Yinjia Dian, and surrounding areas for days, suffering over ten thousand casualties. On the 23rd, they were unable to sustain the fight and retreated in defeat towards the southeast in two directions. However, the Chinese army had already adopted a strategy of divided attacks, sending large units to the rear of the Japanese army to cut off their retreat route. Important strongholds such as Wanjiadian and Ta'erwan have been successively recaptured by the Chinese army. The Japanese forces besieged in this area are on the verge of complete annihilation.

<h3 id="e7">A Certain Traveler Discusses the Situation in Lanzhou <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>Chongqing: According to a certain traveler who recently traveled through the northwestern provinces and returned here, in a radio address today, he spoke of the situation in Lanzhou, saying that one might feel that Soviet influence has spread to Lanzhou, as Russian signs can be seen in the streets and Russian faces can occasionally be seen. However, every time they are seen, they are invariably followed by a group of children, shouting "Sir," "Sir" incessantly. This is because when the first Soviet aviators arrived in Lanzhou, they did not know what term of address would be best. Naturally, they did not want to be called "foreign devils," and calling them "comrades" felt too Bolshevik. Later, it was decided to have people call them "Sir," so today, any white person appearing in the streets receives the honorific title of "Sir." This is the only extent of Soviet influence seen in Lanzhou. (24th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

The Prime Minister replied, "We have not had any dealings with puppet governments, so I do not think we need pay attention to this." (24th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e13">Stabilizing Flour and Wheat to Secure the Rice Market <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>Just as the tide of rice manipulation subsides, a wave of flour and wheat manipulation arises. Manipulation is already unforgivable, let alone when aimed at essential food supplies for the people, seeking to monopolize and profit! Harming the people's livelihood and endangering society are reasons enough to seek an immediate halt to such practices.</p>
<p>The usual ratio between flour and rice prices is four to one. Sometimes, it varies depending on the market conditions of flour and rice. However, the current flour price not only matches but exceeds the rice price, which must be considered an extraordinary change. The weight of each bag of flour was changed from 50 pounds to 49 pounds in May of the 13th year of the Republic of China to meet international flour standards, which is approximately 44.45 *jin*. Yet, the price of eleven yuan and several *jiao* for recycled flour, when converted to the weight of one *shi*, is higher than the limited price of rice. Even at the factory wholesale price, it is not much different from the price of one *shi* of rice. If there is no human manipulation, how could the price of flour be so high?</p>
<p>Looking at the cause of the price increase, the highest price of wheat was only six yuan, five or six *jiao*. By late July, the situation gradually changed, with some scrambling to be the first to hoard. In mid-August, the price of rice was nearly thirty yuan, and the price of flour was also six yuan. By late August, the price of rice was thirty-eight or thirty-nine yuan, the price of wheat was ten yuan, and the price of flour was as high as six yuan, four or five *jiao*. In mid-September, the price of flour jumped past the seven-yuan mark. However, according to a survey at the end of September, there were still over two million bags of flour and over five hundred thousand bags of wheat in storage. Therefore, the market in October and November was still calm. By the end of November, the price of flour was seven yuan and six *jiao*, and the price of wheat was twelve yuan and two *jiao*. Once it entered December, the price of rice was as high as forty-seven or forty-eight yuan, and the price of flour rose almost every day. By the time the two concessions limited the price of rice twice, the price of flour was already as high as eight yuan and seven *jiao*. On the first day of trading this year, the price of flour opened at nine yuan, with the customer wholesale price opening at nine yuan and five *jiao*, and wheat at fifteen yuan and a half. By the 16th, the long-rumored ten-yuan flour price was finally realized. Afterward, manufacturers maintained the original ten-yuan wholesale price to avoid intervention. However, those involved were unwilling to sacrifice much, even refusing to sell a few hundred bags at a time. In reality, it was equivalent to having prices without a market. Imported flour had even reached twelve yuan, and the price of wheat was selling at twenty yuan. With such hoarding and manipulation continuing unabated, it is impossible for the price of flour to fall naturally. Why must the market prices of flour and wheat follow the price of rice so closely? There is no necessary reason, it is a matter of human action. They manipulate flour and wheat, in addition to manipulating rice, to achieve their goal of manipulating the entire people's food supply. The trend described above clearly shows this. It seems that they want to exhaust those who maintain the food supply, causing them to abandon the price limits.</p>
<p>The rapid advance, with four consecutive days of increases, is a testament to the fact that they see that since the price of rice has been limited, they can do whatever they want with flour and wheat! Then, they gradually increased the price to the high price of ten yuan. Moreover, the price of recycled flour is usually five to one *jiao* lower than the factory wholesale price. By mid-August, the factories limited the opening price, so they bought back recycled flour, and the price was instead one or two *jiao* higher than the factory wholesale price. Recently, the price has exceeded by one yuan and several *jiao*. Although the price of recycled flour is said to be the "wild price", in reality, it can be regarded as the black market price of factory flour. The official price does not rise, but the black market price rises frequently. Does this accord with the purpose of maintaining the local food supply? If the manufacturers truly have the sincerity to maintain the food supply, why do they limit the supply for actual sales, driving people to seek recycled flour? The so-called recycled flour relies entirely on a warehouse receipt from the factory. The factory may be able to shirk responsibility by saying that the warehouse receipt transaction is a matter for the customers. It is difficult to know the truth behind the "clever opening." The factory's actions are even more suspicious, sometimes restricting production, sometimes restoring the original volume, and sometimes restricting customer sales. Once the price increases, they still supply as usual. This is extremely contradictory, and the profit is in the middle. Now, they are not only restricting customer sales but also restricting street sales, and they are also forcing customers to clear their warehouse receipts. If the price of flour and wheat does not decrease but increases after restricting customer sales, then the so-called restricting the supply is not a clear sign of hoarding and that clearing warehouse receipts is a prelude to raising prices? Therefore, it is rumored in the market that factories will use the high price of wheat and the difficulty in settling the price of foreign wheat as a smokescreen to deceive the public, believing that they will continue to raise prices in the future. On the other hand, using warehouse receipts as a tool to suppress the result of warehouse receipts will make it impossible for customers to ship goods, and they will eventually have to terminate the contract. Then the goods will return to the original owner, and they will be able to ship the goods. Then, once sold, the market can reduce this inventory. Even if the price is stable for a while, they can then raise the price and sell without hesitation. There are also those who say that there is still a small amount of foreign flour circulating in the city, so they want to take advantage of the factory flour being closed to transfer foreign flour to the customers. When the foreign flour is exhausted, then all that is available in Shanghai will be the factory's flour and Japanese flour. When the time comes to monopolize and hoard, then no one will dare to do anything, and there will be no way to do anything. All of these rumors cannot be fully believed, but considering the era of the exchange, the factory manipulated the standard flour and used all kinds of tricks. It's obvious that now, when rice is expensive, it is a great opportunity to manipulate. Why would they not manipulate? The reality is already very clear.</p>
<p>Some say that southerners eat rice, and the price of flour is expensive, so the impact is still small. In fact, flour and rice both occupy the most important part of Shanghai's food supply. Most Shanghai households and workers use noodles to satisfy their hunger in the early morning and late at night. There are also many people who use noodles at normal times, and it is even more so after rice becomes expensive. Therefore, it is not limited to northerners that flour and wheat are important foods. Fried dough sticks and pancakes can be said to be the most common and popular foods. Now, pancakes are as thin as coins, and fried dough sticks are as thin as ropes, and they must be several times their old value to satisfy hunger. It can be seen that the manipulation of flour prices threatens the food supply of the general population. After rice prices were limited and the two *gongbu* strictly cracked down on the market, although there were some who secretly tried to sabotage, they no longer dared to manipulate it openly, while flour and wheat were still active and free. For this reason, the price of flour used to follow the price of rice, but now the price of rice is rising secretly along with the price of flour and wheat. Recently, the rice market once sold high *geng* rice at the limited price, and recently, it has used Su Tong *geng* as the standard. To sell medium *geng* as high *geng* at the limited price is sabotage and raising the price. Therefore, some say that manipulating flour and wheat is because they were unsuccessful in rice. Now, they are combining rice, flour, and wheat into one piece. The momentum is greater, and they can also affect each other. They sing together, is there any day of stability for the food supply?</p>
<p>Then, is the current plan still to limit the price of flour? Yes, but not entirely. To maintain the price limit, there must be a determination to eradicate the black market. To eradicate the black market and implement the price limit, it is also necessary to manage the market and pay attention to distribution. Price limits can only help in an emergency and cannot be a long-term solution. Observing the general trend, there are many more waves in the future of grain. The manipulation of grain is not just an empty threat. They have something to rely on and have the strength. This is why those who have handled the food supply in the past have faced many obstacles and sabotage. As for the management of the flour market, it is easier than rice because it is a manufactured product, and production and sales are easy to equalize, and the cost is not difficult to audit. As for the source of wheat, for the current plan, Australian wheat has been settled, and the United States will dispose of its 25 million surplus wheat, and there is talk of subsidizing the transportation and sale of wheat to China, Hong Kong, and the Philippines. If this is the case, it will help the food supply in China. Stabilizing flour and wheat stabilizes the rice market and stabilizing the rice market improves the people's livelihood. The concession authorities are working for the welfare of millions of people and should continue to take measures to reassure the public.</p>
<h3 id="e14">Letter to the Nation's Military and Civilians from Chairman Chiang <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>Chongqing (Continued from yesterday) (II) Let's start with "Good Neighborly Friendship." One clause contains the following: First, "completely carrying each other along," and second, "comprehensively pursuing means of mutual assistance and linkage." I have compared the meaning of "linkage" to a chain dragging our descendants into the eighteen layers of hell. I believe everyone can recall this. As for "completely carrying each other along," this is truly a new term recently created by the Japanese. Wang Zhaoming said, "Konoe's statement is clear in outline," but what the Japanese want is "completeness." Wang Zhaoming's newspaper once said, "Economic cooperation has a scope and limitations," but the Japanese answered with "completeness." What is "completeness"? There is an idiom in Chinese, "completeness without a trace." Also, anything vague and unmemorable is called "completely forgotten." The so-called completeness is simply without boundaries or traces. To carry each other along to the point of no distinction or trace is, unless it is a "merger," not an explanation of complete swallowing?</p>
<p>(III) The puppet organization must first recognize "Manchukuo," and then Japan and Manchukuo will respect China's territorial sovereignty. Imagine, recognizing the puppet state of Manchukuo while still saying they respect China's territory and sovereignty, and that China's territory and sovereignty are to be respected by the puppet of Manchukuo, carved out of our land. Is this mockery or insult?</p>
<p>(IV) Not only propaganda and education, but also politics, diplomacy, and trade that could damage mutual friendship will be prohibited, not only now, but also in the future. In other words, anything within China that is inconvenient for Japan will be permanently prohibited.</p>
<p>(V) Regarding relations with third countries, measures that violate the principle of mutual cooperation will not be adopted. This means that China's diplomatic power will henceforth completely obey Japan, with no room for freedom or independence. Is this not completely reducing China to a Japanese appendage? In addition, advisors will be dispatched to the "New Central Government," and in areas of intense integration and other specific regions. This means deploying layers of surveillance personnel throughout China.</p>
<p>(VI) To cooperate in cultural integration and creation means that China will henceforth not be allowed to have an independent culture, nor will Chinese people be allowed to have their own cultural creations.</p>
<p>(VII) Furthermore, regarding the so-called "joint defense" matters, it is not only "joint anti-communism" but also cooperation in maintaining common security. The new term "common security" is an annotation for turning the entire China into a Japanese military garrison area and a justification for stationing troops anywhere in China.</p>
<p>(VIII) Then, speaking of "anti-communism," the true intentions are revealed. Troops must be stationed in key locations in North China and Mongolia. Then, an anti-communist military alliance must be formed. Then, China must recognize that Chinese warships and units can be stationed for long periods in specific locations along the Yangtze River and on islands in South China. Because these locations are too far from Japan's hypothetical enemy, the Soviet Union, and cannot be applied to the term "anti-communism," the above text creates the phrase "maintenance of common security" to apply it. Moreover, Japan retains military "rights of request" and "rights of supervision" over the railways, aviation, communications, major ports, and waterways in the garrison areas. As for the deployment of Chinese domestic military and police and military facilities, it must be limited to a minimum. Furthermore, the construction of this minimal military and police force must be carried out with the cooperation of advisors dispatched by Japan. What is cooperation? Simply surveillance and control.</p>
<p>(IX) Let's look at the content of the so-called economic cooperation. First, there must be mutual assistance and linkage; second, there must be "economic integration," completely plundering China's economy. Even China's financial and economic policies, as well as the establishment of tariffs and customs systems, must be subject to its control, restriction, and regulation.</p>
<p>(X) Regarding resource development, tariff transactions, aviation, transportation, communications, and meteorological surveys, agreements must be concluded based on the principles of facilitating Japanese assistance and cooperation and material supply and demand.</p>
<p>(XI) Japan will be granted special convenience in resource development and utilization in North China and Inner Mongolia. In other regions, Japan will also be granted the necessary convenience regarding specific resources. The focus of the so-called nationwide transportation cooperation includes all of China's aviation, the railways of North China (including the Longhai Railway), maritime transport between China and Japan and along the Chinese coast, Yangtze River shipping, and communications between North China and the lower reaches of the Yangtze River.</p>
<p>All of the above is what Japan wants to encompass all of China, so that even our compatriots' food, clothing, housing, and transportation will be subject to Japanese control, with no room for freedom. Fearing that they had not listed everything completely, in the remarks column, they further stipulated that close consultation with the Japanese side was required, as a justification for demanding anything at any time. Besides this, there were also regulations regarding the relationship between the puppet central government and the three puppet organizations in Nanjing, North China, and Mengjiang. The content was very detailed, but the main spirit was nothing more than cutting them apart piece by piece for them to devour.</p>
<p>Most noteworthy is that Xiamen and Hainan Island are specifically listed as separate articles. Xiamen is to be established as a special administrative region, and Japan's special status on "Hainan Island" must be recognized, giving it the right to handle aviation, communications, maritime transport, and national defense (necessary resource development and utilization matters). Isn't this simply saying that Xiamen and Hainan Island should be permanently ceded to Japan? What is not explicitly mentioned are the so-called specific islands along the South China coast. We must pay attention to this because this is Japan's determination to stir up storms in the Pacific, and to use the resources of our sacred territory and the flesh and blood of the descendants of the Yellow Emperor as capital for its adventurous southward and northward advances.</p>
<p>Looking at this secret agreement, it is many times more extensive and vicious than the Twenty-One Demands that Japan presented to Yuan Shikai in 1915. If these conditions are put into practice, China will fall into eternal ruin, and the 450 million descendants of the Yellow Emperor will truly have no survivors. The disaster for East Asia and the world is even more unfathomable. Yet Wang Zhaoming hurriedly and happily signed it on the last day of the lunar year (December 30th). In this secret agreement, I ask all compatriots, is this peace, or "adjustment of national relations," or conditions for national subjugation? Can China's independence and freedom be guaranteed by the implementation of these conditions, or will they be completely forfeited forever?</p>
<p>What is especially infuriating is that I ask all compatriots to take another look at a document that Wang Zhaoming presented to the Japanese, entitled "Matters Urgently Hoped for from the Japanese Side Before the Establishment of the New Government." What are the "necessary conditions for the establishment of the central government" that he considered? He believed that territorial sovereignty, administration, etc., which are matters of life and death for the nation and the people, could all be ignored. What he contested was a loan of 40 million yuan, as well as the deposit of tariffs, and the transfer of consolidated taxes and salt taxes. To put it plainly, Wang Zhaoming's request to the Japanese was that with money, he would not contest anything at all. In addition, what he requested was the opening of a section of the Yangtze River between Nanjing and Shanghai, and secondarily, the issue of travel permits and constitutional police inspection rights between Beijing and Shanghai, believing that these few items could guarantee his personal safety. His request for the opening of the Yangtze River was not to deceive the Western powers, and his request for travel permits and constitutional police rights had no other purpose. In reality, it was in preparation for escaping by sea or land when things got out of hand.</p>
<p>Therefore, apart from these, he could not contest anything at all, only for these two points he must humbly request the Japanese, even praising them as "changing the people's perceptions and improving the people's psychology." Look at how he treats our compatriots. But how did the Japanese side respond to him? The Japanese side's final response was very simple: the 40 million yuan could only be used when the principles of the new relationship between Japan and China and other transitional measures were confirmed, and they were prepared to find ways to fulfill his wishes. As for tariff revenue, it would still be deposited in the Yokohama Specie Bank, and the portions in North China and Inner Mongolia would still be reserved. The opening of the Yangtze River was rejected. Regarding travel permits and constitutional police inspections, it would have to wait for the actual situation on the ground, such as the suitability for peaceful conditions, and would be determined by the Japanese and Chinese sides through appropriate consultation. We must pay attention to the Japanese saying "upon confirmation." This means that the Japanese wanted Wang to sign the "Essentials of Adjusting the New Relationship between Japan and China" to give him a guarantee that he would never regret it, before paying him the 40 million yuan. From this, we can know the reason why Wang made a full promise on December 30. From this, we can know the inside story of why certain newspapers in Shanghai were anxious and agitated in November and December, putting on a show.</p>
<p>Just looking at these few documents, there is no need for me to elaborate further. I am only reminding the very few compatriots who are too honest and who judge others by their own standards and are inevitably confused by Wang's past smokescreens. After reading these few documents revealed from his own inside story, I ask, what are your thoughts?</p>
<p>Over the past year, the Japanese cabinet has changed from Konoe to Hiranuma, from Hiranuma to Abe, and from Abe to Yonai, escaping the control of the young officers. Now, the new Japanese cabinet has taken the stage. Yonai's first statement was to assist in the creation of the "New Central Government," but the first error was to ask "the entire country to unite to establish a new order in East Asia." This shows that there is disagreement between the Japanese political circles and the people, and that there are still many clear-headed individuals within Japan who know that this attempt to destroy another country will inevitably lead Japan to destruction. No matter how the young military cliques deceive those above and below, they cannot hide the contradictions and disagreements within Japan. But this disagreement is not about the success or failure of the puppet regime. I determined months ago that a puppet organization would appear sooner or later. I also said, "No matter how many puppet organizations the enemy creates, no matter what name these puppet organizations borrow, we only regard them as Japanese slaves. Their internal and external actions will not have the slightest effect, nor will they harm our party or country in the slightest."</p>
<p>Today, we are resisting Japan first. 450 million compatriots are determined to guarantee the independent survival of the Republic of China. No force, no conspiracy, can ever destroy our China. However, the disclosure of Wang's documents this time is of important significance. If it were not for someone inside him acting on their conscience to make this secret agreement public, I can determine that no matter how the Japanese and puppets try to cover up all or at least part of it, Wang would continue to deceive our honest compatriots with flowery words. Now, when this secret agreement was delivered, when it was signed, when it was brought back to Tokyo, and how the Japanese magnates threatened him, it is all very clear. Even if Wang and the Japanese magnates want to deny it, they have no way to deny it. Even if they want to alter and conceal it, let's see how they can alter and conceal it.

<h3 id="e15">The Process of Wang's Secret Agreement with the Japanese is Announced by Tao Xisheng in Hong Kong <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>Hong Kong: Tao Xisheng announced on the 22nd an article on the conditions of Japan for the so-called new regime, stating roughly that on October 3rd of last year, Zhou Fohai, Mei Shiping, and I, under Wang's orders, went to the Sanliu Garden. Yingzuo presented the principles and attachments of the so-called new relationship between China and Japan. When he presented it, he said that this was the full hope of the Japanese side, hoping that everyone would discuss it frankly. On November 5th, Wang proposed a cadre meeting, which, in addition to the above three people, included Gao Zongwu, Chen Chunchan, and Lin Baisheng. From this, negotiations continued for about two weeks. Because the issues of anti-communist troop deployments on the North China Railway and Shanghai could not be resolved for a time, they were suspended. On the 18th, Inukai and Zhou Fohai secretly contacted each other, and as a result, negotiations were reopened, and both sides signed. The meeting on the results of the negotiations was attended by Chen Gongbo, Zhou Fohai, Mei Shiping, Lin Baisheng, and myself. Chen Gongbo left Shanghai on the 28th, unwilling to end this negotiation. I decided not to attend. When the conditions first came into our hands, Wang and his wife were very disappointed and worried. At that time, they invited me and Gao Zongwu to secretly discuss methods to stop the formation of the government. Later, the Japanese side and Wang's internal factions echoed each other, and under pressure from both sides, the negotiations were hastily concluded, and they decided to move forward with the formation of the government. At this time, I believed that if I did not escape, I would have to sign the secret agreement on the one hand, and lose my life in Shanghai on the other. On December 28th, I planned a method to go to Shanghai, and on January 3rd, Gao Zongwu and I went to Hong Kong together. Before September of last year, Wang's negotiations with Japan were all presided over by Gao Zongwu. Because the Japanese side found Gao Zongwu's attitude to be stern, they changed to negotiating with Zhou Fohai, who was willing to give in to the end. Although Gao Zongwu told Wang everything he knew, he deeply knew that the situation was over and could not be reversed, so he decided to escape. Whether China and Japan can achieve peace and end the war depends purely on whether China can obtain sovereign independence and administrative integrity. If not, of course, it cannot be (peace), and if it cannot be (peace), there is of course no need to force it. Look at the conditions proposed by the Japanese side. Is there sincerity and determination to respect China's sovereign independence and administrative integrity? Is there any room left for China's sovereignty and the people's livelihood? This cannot be contested with words. After we arrived in Hong Kong, we telegraphed Wang and his cadres with this intention, asking them to consider it. My younger brother and others have advocated peace for three years, and this ambition has not changed. We sincerely hope that it will succeed, and we do not want it to fail. The reason for our retirement is that we have seen that the conditions are unacceptable and that the formation of the government is not worth trying. If we think that this can still be called peace, and that this can still be used to build the country, it is truly chilling. For the sake of our country, why insert our newly loved comrades into the established situation of the "Reformed Government" and boast of an independent and autonomous "New Regime"? This kind of regime has no meaning except to sign conditions for national subjugation. Since it is a fact, it cannot be contested with words. What I hope is that my public and comrades, in the midst of indignation, will reconsider it and not treat love as hate for the public. We left without saying goodbye because we were saddened by the speed of the signing and deeply knew that saying goodbye would not allow us to leave. That is why we said this. The reply telegram only blamed us for leaving and did not mention the issue of forming the "government." Our final advice was clearly ineffective, so we published the original text of the conditions proposed by the Japanese side, seeking public judgment and awakening from the people. If you ask what region the conditions contain, I can answer that it ranges from Heilongjiang to Hainan Island. If you ask what things the conditions contain, I can answer that it ranges from minerals to meteorology, from rivers to territorial waters. On the mainland, it extends from the southeast to the northwest. All of this is held or controlled by Japan without omission. To describe a few key points in the conditions, it is certain that national sovereignty will be lost without a doubt. Everyone can see that under these conditions, China only has one way out: death. Such conditions are still gladly accepted by some people, and the speed and ease with which they are accepted sometimes surprises the Japanese who participated in the negotiations. Those with knowledge on the Japanese side have long seen that their acceptance cannot represent the Chinese people. Of course, even if someone signs these conditions, in the eyes of the Chinese people, it is still a piece of waste paper. Our ancestors sigh in their graves, and our descendants have already lost their freedom in the womb. Are you willing to organize a "government" to implement this? If Japan wants to end the war and achieve peace, it can only cross out these conditions, both in word and in spirit. If Wang and his cadres want to end the war and achieve peace, they can only cross out these conditions and all activities based on these conditions, and wait for the Japanese to become more enlightened.

<p>Washington: Japanese Ambassador Horinouchi held talks with Assistant Secretary of State Hull today for a long time, and Hull answered all the questions he raised. Horinouchi first asked whether the US government was prepared to raise import tariffs and ship taxes on Japanese goods after the current US-Japan trade agreement expires on the 26th of this month. Hull replied that the evolution of trade relations between the two countries would henceforth depend entirely on Japan's attitude towards Americans in China. Horinouchi then asked if the two sides could exchange notes to confirm the future trade relations between the two countries. Hull replied that this matter should be left for consideration and that US Ambassador to Japan Grew might discuss this when he holds talks with Japanese Foreign Ministry officials. Horinouchi then asked whether the legal status of Japanese merchants in the United States would change in the future. Hull replied that after the trade agreement expires, the US government would temporarily treat Japanese merchants as foreign tourists. Ambassador Horinouchi also told the press afterward, "It is hoped that after the expiration of this agreement, normal trade relations between the US and Japan can still be maintained." He said that his government has indeed issued an order stipulating that US goods imported into his country will still be taxed at the original rates, pending further orders. Political figures here commented that if Japan's attitude towards American interests and the interests of the other signatory countries of the Nine-Power Treaty in Washington does not change, the US will immediately implement economic sanctions. Judging from Ambassador Horinouchi's visit to Hull today, it can be seen that Japan is eager to please the US and will avoid any action that may cause the US to take retaliatory measures after the trade agreement expires. (Havas Telegraph from the 23rd)</p>
<p>Washington: Assistant Secretary of State Hull told Japanese Ambassador to the US Horinouchi yesterday in a half-hour conversation that the termination of the trade agreement in itself does not imply that import tariffs and ship taxes will be changed, but that future trade relations depend on the development of the Far East. The Japanese proposal to exchange diplomatic notes explaining the status of trade relations between the two countries cannot be accepted for the time being. (Reuters Telegraph from the 24th)</p>
<p>Washington: The US government yesterday firmly rejected Japan's proposal to negotiate a new trade agreement to replace the US-Japan trade agreement of 1911, which expires on Friday. The US government announced the abrogation of the US-Japan trade agreement on July 26th of last year to retaliate against Japan's infringement of American rights and interests in the Far East and attacks on American nationals. State Department officials clearly declared to Japanese Ambassador to the US Kensuke Horinouchi yesterday that the US government would not negotiate a temporary agreement with Japan to replace the expiring trade agreement. State Department officials informed the Japanese ambassador that there would be no changes in tariffs and other matters stipulated by the current treaty after the trade agreement expires, but advised the Japanese side that the overall future of US-Japan trade relations will depend on the evolution of the situation in the Far East. The purpose of the State Department is obviously to keep Japan in "good behavior" for the time being in order to determine Japan's future policy towards American interests in the established East and whether to impose an embargo on Japan or conclude a new trade agreement with it. Ambassador Horinouchi visited the State Department yesterday to inquire about expectations after the expiration of the US-Japan trade agreement. He had scheduled a meeting with Secretary of State Hull at 11 o'clock, but Hull was newly suffering from a cold and resting at home and could not meet with him. Ambassador Horinouchi then met with Assistant Secretary of State Hull for half an hour. During State Department Assistant Welles's vacation, Hull is the senior official of the State Department. Horinouchi clearly inquired whether there would be changes in import tariffs on Japanese goods and tonnage taxes on Japanese ships after the expiration of the US-Japan trade agreement and whether the two countries could exchange notes to stipulate temporary trade relations. Hull replied that there would be no changes in import tariffs and tonnage taxes after the expiration of the US-Japan trade agreement. Hull stated in answering the same nature of questions that the US has repeatedly declared that relations between the US and Japan will depend on the evolution of the situation. Hull also told Horinouchi that the issue of exchanging notes between the two countries would be discussed and may be a part of the Tokyo talks. Hull also told Horinouchi that the US government has now decided that foreign nationals cannot obtain the status of "treaty merchant" without the provisions of a trade agreement, but may be temporarily allowed to enter the country for business and travel according to the Immigration Act of 1924. During the period without a trade agreement, it is generally expected that Japanese people requesting to enter the US will be handled in accordance with the current laws and regulations for issuing temporary tourist passports. It is believed that these regulations will guarantee the right of Japanese "treaty merchants" to engage in business in the US, but they must apply to the authorities for the issuance of a temporary tourist permit and must apply once every month.</p>
<p>After meeting with Hull, Kensuke Horinouchi told reporters that he hoped that US-Japan relations after the expiration of the trade agreement would be the same as before. He learned that Tokyo would soon issue a decree announcing that Japan's import tariffs on the US would still be treated the same as other countries. Horinouchi also said that he hoped that US Ambassador to Japan Grew and Japanese Foreign Minister Hachiro Arita would hold another meeting, but he also said that he did not know when the negotiations would begin. State Department officials refused to immediately criticize Horinouchi's visit to the State Department, but State Department officials met immediately after Horinouchi left, mostly to discuss the matter of issuing a statement to reporters. (United Press Telegraph from the 24th)</p>
<p>New York: The US-Japan trade agreement is scheduled to expire on the 26th of this month. The morning newspapers here recently commented on this matter and expressed their approval of the firm attitude taken by the US government, saying that as long as Japan's attitude towards the interests and the Nine-Power Treaty that the US maintains in China does not change, the US does not intend to renew the trade agreement with it. (Havas Telegraph from the 24th)</p>
<p>Washington: Republican Senator Wiley told the Senate yesterday that any action to implement a ban on the export of munitions and raw materials to Japan may cause Japan to formally declare war on China, lock down Chinese ports, and expel foreigners from Japanese-occupied areas. Wiley suggested that "before we discuss US aid to China and the allied countries providing aid to China," the Senate should consider "other proposals that Japan wishes to make." Wiley also said that "the US and Japan can hold a round table conference to discuss trade relations between the two countries, as well as immigration restrictions, arms reduction, and economic assistance." He also advocated signing a new trade agreement to replace the US-Japan trade agreement of 1911, which expires on Friday. (United Press Telegraph from the 24th)</p>

At the same time, the Senate will also consider Senators Pittman and White's embargo proposals.

<h3 id="e18">Japanese Ship Ryuta Maru Again Inspected by British Warship; Japan Lodges Another Protest Regarding the Asama Maru Incident; British Government Unwilling to Concede to Japan <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>Honolulu: According to a wireless message received here, today (the 23rd), a destroyer near the coast of Honolulu ordered the Japanese mail ship Ryuta Maru to stop, inquired about its name and destination, and searched the interior of the ship. Although the captain of the Ryuta Maru questioned the nationality and name of the destroyer, the warship did not answer at all. Furthermore, although five German passengers on the Ryuta Maru were safe, two of them voluntarily declared their willingness to disembark in Honolulu. The Ryuta Maru is scheduled to enter Honolulu Harbor at 2:00 PM today (7:30 PM on the 24th according to Japanese time). (Allied Press, 23rd)</p>
<p>Tokyo: Japanese Foreign Minister Arita met with Yamada, the Second Section Chief of the Western European and Asian Affairs Bureau, at his official residence at 9:00 PM on the 23rd to discuss countermeasures for the Asama Maru incident. As a result, they decided to reiterate Japan's views and determination to the British government. Subsequently, at 9:30 PM, he again invited the British Ambassador Craigie for a meeting. During the thirty-minute meeting, he lodged the same strong protest as the firm reservation of the right to demand the extradition of the Germans that Vice Foreign Minister Tani had made to the British government last night. Moreover, a severe warning was issued to Japanese ships such as the Rakuyo Maru, Ginyo Maru, and Ryuta Maru, which are currently returning home across the Pacific, that the serious incident of the Asama Maru should not be repeated. (Allied Press, 24th)</p>
<p>Tokyo: Regarding the British Navy's detention of twenty-one Germans on the Asama Maru, Vice Foreign Minister Tani lodged a protest with the British Ambassador Craigie on the 22nd, stating, "If it is determined that the detained Germans are non-active-duty military personnel, then the right to demand their immediate extradition to the government must be reserved." Furthermore, Vice Foreign Minister Tani explained that the Japanese Navy believed that the detention of the Germans was a unilateral interpretation of international law by the British government, which was vastly different from the Japanese government's view. He said that at this juncture, considering the political complications, it would be appropriate to voluntarily extradite the detained Germans to the Japanese side, urging the British side to give it serious consideration. He also said that if the British government insisted on its theory and did not immediately extradite the Germans, the Imperial government would formally demand their extradition based on its reserved rights. Therefore, the Japanese government is currently awaiting a substantial response to the protest of the 22nd and a voluntary extradition from the British side. Regarding this point, if the British side's handling is unsatisfactory, then preparations will be made for all formal extradition procedures, and the British side's attitude is being closely monitored. (Allied Press, 24th)</p>
<p>Tokyo: The Asahi Shimbun reports that Japan has notified Britain that Japan has already taken "effective and appropriate self-defense measures" for its ships returning across the Pacific. This point was notified by Japanese Foreign Minister Arita to British Ambassador Sir Robert Craigie last night. Arita, with a "stern attitude," told the British ambassador that if another "unfortunate incident" were to occur, the great shock felt by the Japanese government and public would have the most serious consequences for British-Japanese relations. (Reuters, 24th)</p>
<p>Tokyo: The Foreign Ministry spokesman stated to newspaper reporters this morning that the Japanese people view the incident of the Asama Maru being intercepted and searched by a British cruiser with hatred, and the result has been an automatic outburst of national sentiment throughout Japan. Because the incident occurred practically in the shadow of sacred Mount Fuji, the Foreign Ministry is still awaiting the British government's fullest explanation. At the same time, Japan reserves the right to demand the return of the twenty-one Germans who were captured, because we cannot accept the broad definition of its rights given by Britain. The spokesman refused to discuss whether the German order of June 22, 1938, which effectively listed all Germans of military age as soldiers, was accurate, saying that he adhered to the Japanese side's opinion. (Reuters, 24th)</p>
<p>Tokyo: In order to thoroughly inform the nation of the truth of the Asama Maru incident, the Japanese government specially invited fifty members of the House of Representatives, including the Speaker and Vice Speaker, and representatives from various factions, to the Prime Minister's official residence at 1:30 PM today. From the government side, Prime Minister Yonai and Foreign Minister Arita attended to explain in detail the facts investigated by the Foreign Ministry and the government's countermeasures, based on the report of Captain Watanabe of the Asama Maru, and to seek their understanding. Furthermore, starting at 3:00 PM, fifty representatives from various factions of the House of Peers were invited for further explanation. It was also decided to invite executives from major newspapers and news agencies in Tokyo at 5:00 PM for the same explanation. (Allied Press, 24th)</p>
<p>Tokyo: In order to discuss measures to deal with the aftermath of the Asama Maru incident and to prevent illegal and forceful actions by the British Navy, the Japanese government authorities continued to hold a meeting of relevant officials at the Foreign Ministry at 11:00 AM today. From the Foreign Ministry, Yamada, the Second Section Chief of the European and Asian Affairs Bureau, and Matsudaira, the Second Section Chief of the Treaty Bureau, attended. From the Navy, Lieutenant Commander Shiba of the Military Affairs Bureau attended. From the Army, Lieutenant Colonel Takayama of the Military Affairs Bureau attended. From the Ministry of Communications, official Kimura of the Ship Administration Bureau attended. First, the Foreign Ministry reported that, according to information from the British side, the British government views the Asama Maru issue as merely a minor dispute arising from different interpretations of international law. Therefore, it does not seem to attach importance to the future of the case. The British government's attitude reveals a significant lack of understanding of the feelings of the Japanese people. Therefore, Foreign Minister Arita invited Ambassador Craigie last night (23rd) to explain the seriousness of the situation and urged him to prompt the British government to give it deep consideration. Next, based on the information that the mail ship Ryuta Maru, which departed from San Francisco on the 18th, was inspected by a foreign warship off the coast of Honolulu, measures to deal with the incident and future countermeasures were discussed. (Allied Press, 24th)</p>
<p>Tokyo: Officials from the Foreign Ministry and the Navy Ministry held a joint meeting this morning to discuss the measures that Japan would take regarding the British Navy's activities in the Pacific and the rumored interception and search of the Ryuta Maru by a British destroyer, and exchanged opinions. According to semi-official sources, an official from the Foreign Ministry pointed out, "British people do not seem to hold a serious view of the Asama Maru incident, which shows that Britain has not noticed the national sentiment of Japan. Therefore, Foreign Minister Arita invited British Ambassador Sir Robert Craigie to the Foreign Ministry last night to urge the British Ambassador to pay attention to the seriousness of this incident." (Reuters, 24th)</p>
<p>London: According to news released here today, the British warship's capture of the twenty-one Germans aboard the Japanese ship Asama Maru is a common practice in wartime, permitted by international law, and was done during the last Great War. The purpose is to prevent individuals who have a special relationship to the conduct of the war from returning to the enemy country. Several belligerent countries have already taken the same action in the current war and have not caused any objections. The Allied countries have always strived to show the greatest courtesy to neutral countries and reduce their inconvenience. The remarks made by the German ambassador to Japan, Wirth, can be refuted by the fact that on September 24 of last year, a German warship intercepted the Swedish merchant ship Magareta off the coast of Sweden and captured the British fishermen on board. According to the German order issued on June 22, 1938, all Germans of military age are obligated to enter military service or receive special training. Now, Germans are traveling in groups, avoiding the Atlantic route and taking the longer Pacific route, attempting to escape arrest. It should be known that it is necessary to arrest technicians who can be used in submarine warfare. For the sake of Britain and neutral countries, submarine warfare should be stopped. (Reuters, 24th)</p>
<p>London: Regarding the "Asama Maru" case involving a Japanese mail ship, official sources here stated that the Japanese Foreign Ministry had met again with British Ambassador Craigie last night to inform him that the Japanese government considered the nature of the case to be extremely serious. The British government is carefully studying this issue. It is reported that when the Foreign Office issues a response in the next few days, it will try its best to explain that this matter is very ordinary, because during the last European war, the Allied countries, including Japan, intercepted a total of sixty-four neutral country ships and captured 350 people from certain European countries. This shows that the actions of the British warship intercepting the "Asama Maru" did not violate international law. In addition, German warships recently captured British and Polish fishermen from neutral country ships on the high seas, further proving that it is a common action. (Havas, 24th)</p>
<p>Demonstration Held by Tokyo Citizens</p>
<p>Tokyo: Members of the Yamato Society planned to stage a demonstration in front of the British Embassy yesterday afternoon over the Asama Maru incident. The gates of the British Embassy were immediately closed, and additional police were deployed for security. When the Yamato Society held a public rally, it decided to take demonstration action, but it was blocked by the police. The demonstrators were led into a nearby shrine, but were allowed to send two representatives into the British Embassy to read a lengthy statement to the Second Secretary, accusing Britain of defiling Japan's honor and prestige and demanding an apology from the British government. Today, several small groups of active demonstrators stood outside the British Embassy all day. Delegations from the Tokyo City Council, the Japan Youth Association, and the Yamato Society were received by Second Secretary Sabridge and presented a petition demanding that Britain (1) return the twenty-one Germans captured from the Asama Maru, (2) express regret, and (3) guarantee that such incidents will not occur again in the future. At 5:20 PM, the demonstrators gradually dispersed, and the police stationed at the British Embassy also withdrew. (Reuters, 24th)</p>
<p>Tokyo: The Miyako Shimbun today published a commentary suggesting that the Japanese Navy detain all American ships in Japanese and Chinese waters and arrest adult British people in retaliation for the British action in the "Asama Maru" incident. In addition, goods found on British ships that are destined for the Chongqing government should be confiscated. At the same time, the "Kokumin Shimbun" and "Hochi Shimbun" continue to incite anti-British movements. (United Press, 24th)</p>

<h3 id="e20">Distress Situation of Italian Ship in the Mediterranean; One Hundred and Seven People Killed <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>Genoa: The Italian mail ship "Orazio" was burned in the Mediterranean on Sunday. According to the latest announcement by the Italian shipping company, a total of 107 people were killed, including 47 passengers and 60 crew members. The remaining 318 people were rescued by the Italian ship "Conte Biancamano," and 173 people were rescued by the "Columbus." When these people landed, they described the events, saying that the "Orazio" sent out a distress signal and the "Conte Biancamano" did not arrive for ten hours. A Danish woman named Lai Sen, who arrived in Genoa wearing silk pajamas, told people that she was awakened by a noise at 4:00 AM on Sunday and rushed to the deck, where she saw the crew struggling to put out the fire. Before long, the ship's engine stopped, all the lights went out, and after the alarm sounded, passengers rushed to the deck. Fortunately, the efforts of the crew calmed the chaos. At the time, the middle of the ship was on fire, and the passengers were mostly gathered at the front of the ship, with thick smoke swirling around, making it difficult to breathe and impossible to open their eyes. Her door and legs were burned. The situation when people went down to the small boat was particularly tragic, because the bridge and the side of the ship were already hot and difficult to approach, and the sea was turbulent, so there was a risk of the lifeboats crashing into the ship's hull. She saw several men jump into the sea. Another woman named Frailo had been in distress on the Dutch ship "Simon Bolivar," which was sunk by a mine. This time, she was rescued again with her husband and young daughter. Three English women on board were also rescued. Those who escaped expressed their gratitude to the French, who turned on searchlights and carried out rescue work at the scene of the incident. (Reuters, 24th)</p>
<h3 id="e21">U.S. Navy Shipbuilding Program; Three Years Reduced to Two Years; Mr. Vinson's Proposal <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>Washington: Mr. Vinson, Chairman of the U.S. House Naval Affairs Committee, yesterday asked the Navy Department to submit a two-year naval shipbuilding program to replace the three-year program. This move has the potential to reduce the $1.3 billion fleet expansion program. Vinson said that if a two-year program is established, fewer cruisers and submarines can be built, but aircraft carriers and submarines still need to be specified, and three aircraft carriers still need to be specified. According to Vinson's proposal on January 18 to reduce the original appropriation of $500 million, it would be unwise to pre-pile many shipbuilding projects that cannot be started in time. If Vinson's proposal is adopted, the originally planned total of 4 million tons will be reduced to 2.18 million tons. (Reuters, 24th)</p>
<h3 id="e22">The Issue of the American Security Zone; France Submits a Reply; Must Guarantee That German Warships Do Not Enter the Zone; Otherwise, France Should Enjoy the Rights of a Belligerent <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>Paris: Regarding the issue of the security zone along the American continent, after the Panamanian government sent a note to France on December 23 of last year on behalf of the twenty-one American republics, the French government has submitted a reply, stating that in order for this security zone to be effectively implemented, the governments of the American countries should provide guarantees to ensure that Germany does not send warships or supply ships into the zone, which is a necessary step. However, given the current situation, the governments of the American countries do not seem to intend to prevent German warships from engaging in hostile activities in the security zone. Therefore, French warships have the right to prevent or curb such activities in accordance with international law, which the American countries cannot deny. In short, the goal of the American countries should be achieved based on this principle, which is also accepted by the belligerent countries. Before an agreement is reached between the countries concerned, the French government will continue to reserve all the rights of a belligerent in accordance with international law. With regard to the German pocket battleship "Spee," the French ship "Taiwan" was attacked by the ship in the American security zone. Therefore, if the American countries cannot guarantee that German warships will not enter the security zone, it is natural that Britain and France have the right to resist the activities of German warships. In addition, the fact that the British and French fleets maintain an advantage is undeniable. For the sake of self-preservation, German warships will inevitably use the American security zone as a hiding place. If this is the case, the benefits of the British and French advantages of the Navy will be lost. In conclusion, although certain non-belligerent countries may feel inconvenienced by the British and French blockade, the damage caused by Germany's indiscriminate attacks on the ships of neutral countries is insignificant and not worth mentioning.

<h3 id="e23">Incident of American Ships Being Inspected; British-American Negotiations; The U.S. Still Expresses Dissatisfaction with the British Response <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>London: Regarding the memorandum submitted by the U.S. government to the British Ambassador to the U.S. yesterday, which stated that American ships were delayed in the contraband inspection port of Gibraltar more than Italian ships, those in charge in London have recently offered an explanation, saying that this delay was not caused by Britain giving preferential treatment to any one country. Anyone who follows the measures set by the Contraband Management Office, which aims to facilitate inspection, can be quickly released. The measures set by the Management Office include: (1) Not unloading suspected goods, meaning that the shipowner is responsible for ensuring that the goods cannot be unloaded if the authorities do not approve of the destination of the goods. (2) Naval permits, which are documents that report the type of goods and the destination in advance. Italian ships report various details in advance, and their cooperation with the British side seems to be better than that of American ships. The British authorities often do not receive information about many American goods, and have not received any prior reports since Christmas. However, the American ship "Washington," which arrived at the port of Gibraltar on Sunday, did not report in advance, but its agent was able to provide a list of goods and give the necessary guarantees. Therefore, the ship was released within 12 hours. Another reason why American ships are often delayed is that American ships mostly carry miscellaneous goods, sometimes as many as 300 kinds, and the inspection takes a lot of time. Italian ships are different, and they mostly carry whole shipments of goods such as oil or grain, so the inspection procedures are simple and release is faster. (Reuters, 24th)</p>
<p>Washington: Upon hearing the British statement that Italian ships seem more willing to cooperate with Britain than American ships, U.S. State Department officials said that the cooperation between American shipping companies and the British Contraband Management Office is astonishing, in order to avoid unpleasant events. Such as American shipping companies applying to the British authorities for naval permits, presenting copies of the ship's cargo list by airmail, and providing guarantees that suspected goods will not be unloaded, are all evidence of the cooperation of American shipping companies. However, American ships are not obligated to cooperate with Britain, so any failure to cooperate cannot be a reason for unduly delaying American ships. (Reuters, 24th)</p>

<p>Paris: The Polish National Committee, which is an advisory body to the country's President Raczkiewicz, held its first meeting at the Polish Embassy in France yesterday. First, the President's message was read out, expressing the hope that Poland would be able to live and work in peace in the future. Subsequently, General Sikorski, the Prime Minister of the Sikorski Cabinet, gave a speech stating that the current Polish government should establish a strong foundation for a true, fair, disciplined, and democratic system. Our army is being reorganized and will be a strong and powerful tool for liberating the motherland. Former Prime Minister and piano virtuoso Paderewski spoke next, saying, "Poland's national destiny will never be extinguished, and we must liberate it. The army of our country's reconstruction should strive for freedom for the oppressed compatriots. In short, we should take the misfortunes experienced by the motherland as a lesson, and establish a political system in which democracy can coexist with a stable and strong government." The Polish National Committee then passed several motions, declaring Poland's determination to fight for independence. The Allied countries of Britain and France are also fighting for justice, and Poland should be loyal to them. Pope Pius XII recently issued an encyclical expressing sympathy to Poland. The neighboring countries have been enthusiastic in protecting Polish refugees, which is deeply appreciated. In addition, Finland has also been invaded by the Soviet Union, and it is hoped that the country will defeat them. In conclusion, the decisions taken by the Polish people under violent coercion will not be recognized. Those who commit the crimes of looting and destruction within Poland will be punished according to law. (Havas, 24th)</p>

<p>Paris: The first meeting of the Polish Provisional Parliament was held yesterday at the Polish Embassy here. Paderewski, the world-renowned pianist and first Prime Minister of Poland, who was recently appointed as the chief member of the Polish Parliament, attended and delivered a speech. Although Paderewski is old and physically weak, he still has the ability to move listeners. He said, "Poland is not dead. We will rescue Poland from the depths of depravity and restore Poland from destruction. Our army, after winning the final victory with the British and French Allied forces, will re-enter our country with flying banners, and restore freedom to our oppressed compatriots with bayonets." Paderewski also said that Poland's destiny was mostly caused by the governments of recent years, and that this kind of tragedy should be taken as a warning in the future. Finally, he said that the spirit of the compatriots who were killed in Poland for righteousness will never die, and Poland will eventually live, prosper, and be glorious forever for you and me and for all mankind. Although Paderewski's pronunciation was slow and weak, the members wanted to burst into tears upon hearing it, and one female member wept softly. (Reuters, 24th)</p>

<h3 id="e31">Intense Soviet Offensive on the Eastern Finnish Front, Meets Strong Finnish Resistance <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>Helsinki – The Soviet army has resumed a fierce advance along a fifty-mile front, stretching northeast from Lake Ladoga to the border. The battles in this area are feared to be of extreme severity. According to the current situation, it is unlikely that the Soviet army can break through the Finnish lines. However, if they can break through, they could advance rapidly around Lake Ladoga and seize the Mannerheim Line from the rear. However, the latest Finnish communique states that Finnish forces have repelled the attacking Soviet forces, inflicting heavy damage. The Soviet army is launching dense offensives with the powerful assistance of artillery and tank forces. Judging from the thousands of Soviet casualties mentioned in the Finnish communique, the Soviet offensive is fierce. It is heard that the tactics used by the Finnish army are similar to those used by Hannibal to defeat the Romans in ancient times, that is, retreating when the Soviet army launches dense offensives, and then attacking the flanks of the Soviet army to cut off their lines of communication. The Finnish communique also states that the Finnish army continues to fight northeast of Lake Ladoga, with considerable success. Soviet attacks at all points have been repelled and have suffered heavy losses. In the Battle of Kollandaoki, more than a thousand Soviet soldiers were killed. Soviet fighter planes in the war zone appear most frequently in the Karelian Isthmus north of Lake Ladoga. Finnish aircraft have repelled Soviet aircraft and conducted reconnaissance and photographic flights, as well as acting as artillery fire directors. According to unconfirmed reports, six Soviet aircraft were shot down, and the fate of three others is uncertain. (Reuters Telegram, 24th)</p>
<p>Moscow – According to a communique issued by the headquarters of the Leningrad Military District, on the 23rd, both sides' reconnaissance teams were active in the areas of Lippola and Ukhta.

The Soviet Air Force conducted inspection flights and engaged in combat with enemy aircraft. (TASS Telegram, 24th)</p>

<h3 id="e32">After the Disastrous Defeat of the Japanese Army in Northern Guangdong, Chinese Forces are Rapidly Advancing Towards Guangzhou; The North River Advances to Juntian; The East River Recovers Zhengguo; The West River Encircles Sanshui <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>Shaoguan Correspondence: After the disastrous defeat of the Japanese army, which attempted to invade Shaoguan in northern Guangdong, its main force retreated to Guangzhou, hoping to hold out for reinforcements. On the Chinese side, taking advantage of the Japanese army's confusion, it has mobilized the armies of the East, West, and North Rivers, aiming for Guangzhou and advancing step by step. At present, it is about to reach the outskirts of Guangzhou, and a three-sided encirclement is about to take shape. The battle situation is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The Chinese army on the North River route is advancing south with irresistible force. On the 10th, it captured Conghua City, annihilating many Japanese soldiers. The majority of the Japanese army collapsed towards Shengong Taipingchang. On the 11th, the Chinese army had completely recovered Conghua City and, together with a route advancing from Jilonggang, surrounded the Japanese army in the area of Guancun Fengyuan. That morning, more than 600 Japanese soldiers stubbornly held on to Jiekou (northeast of Shengong) to cover the retreat of the main force. The Zhao Division of the Chinese army bravely attacked, sparking a bloody battle that lasted all day, capturing dozens of rifles. Another unit of the Chinese army, searching and advancing from Shiken, has advanced to the vicinity of Hemujing. The battle on the outer line of Shengong will become increasingly fierce.</p>
<p>On the Qingyin route, after a fierce battle along the Qingyin line on the 9th, the Chinese side's fresh troops arrived continuously, having defeated the main force of the Japanese army between Longtang and Shijiao. On the evening of the 10th, they approached the western outskirts of Yinzhanao, where the Japanese army stubbornly defended inside fortifications. The Chinese Wang Division artillery intensively bombarded the Japanese positions. In two hours, more than ten Japanese barracks and fortifications were destroyed, killing a hundred Japanese soldiers. A certain regiment took the opportunity to attack, entering the western outskirts. The Japanese army suffered heavy casualties and retreated to a corner. On the morning of the 11th, the Chinese army recovered Guotai, southeast of Shijiao. By noon, the vanguard of the Chinese army had advanced to the western outskirts of Juntian, joining a unit from the Guangdong Road and launching a fierce attack on Juntian. The Japanese army then moved to Songqiaopai (west of Juntian) and Sandousong (southwest of Yinzhanao) to defend firmly.</p>
<p>The Zhang Division, which intercepted the retreating Japanese army from Qingyuan from Lubao to the northeast, fought fiercely with the Japanese army in Chini and Tanbu for several days. The Japanese army in Guanyao and Fengyong, which belong to Nanhai, attempted to provide assistance. On the 12th, they advanced north along the Chantan Highway to Tanbu, under the cover of many tanks, and the two sides re-enacted a bloody battle. On the same day, a certain unit of the Chinese army advanced from Tanbu to Xinjie at 1:00 AM. The Yang Suiliang unit of the Second District team, which was active in the areas of Bicun, Dayibu, and Daling, launched a joint attack, rushing into Xinjie Station and engaging in hand-to-hand combat with the Japanese army. Soon, a large unit of the Japanese army from Xinminbu came to reinforce, and the Chinese army firmly defended the northwest periphery and fought fiercely with the Japanese army.</p>
<p>The Chinese army on the East River Eastern Route, taking advantage of the disastrous defeat of the Japanese army's northern invasion and the emptiness of the rear in Zengcheng and Dongguan, launched a counter-offensive on both the north and south banks to cooperate with the Chinese armies on the Northwest River and complete the overall attack formation on the outskirts of Guangzhou. In the past week, the Chinese army continued to move east through Heyuan. One unit advanced to Longmen to intercept the defeated Japanese army that had invaded the north, one unit advanced along the Luofu Mountain foothills from Boluo to attack Zengcheng, and one unit attacked Shilong from the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway and the Dongjiang River. In addition, a certain elite force cooperated with the teams from the Third and Fourth Districts, mixed into the rear of the Japanese army in Dongguan and Zengcheng, launched guerrilla tactics to assist in the counter-offensive. At present, the battles on all routes have been launched one after another. It has been learned that the Chinese army, which has mixed into the rear of the Japanese army in Zengcheng, has cooperated with the Second District guerrilla team for several days, attacking the Japanese army on the Zengtan and Guangzeng highways. On the evening of the 4th, the Zhao Division plainclothes team cooperated with the Shan Rongpei unit of the guerrilla team and attacked Shitan at night. More than 300 Japanese soldiers were unable to resist. The Chinese army entered the station along the Zengtan Road and set fire to the nearby Japanese barracks. For a time, the flames soared into the sky, and the Japanese army fled in panic. Soon, the Japanese army in Zengpo heard the news and sent a team of hundreds to provide reinforcements. The Chinese army then calmly withdrew. According to reports, the Japanese army in Zengcheng had sent a large part of its force to the Longmen and Xinfeng areas to provide reinforcements. Later, after the Japanese army that invaded the north was defeated, fearing that the Chinese army would launch a large-scale attack on Zengcheng and break through the eastern defense line of Guangzhou, it transferred the Japanese army from Longmen County back to Zengcheng. At present, there are more than 2,000 Japanese soldiers in the four suburbs of Zengcheng. Therefore, on the 4th and 5th, the Japanese army in Dipaidi, Longmen, was defeated by the Huang Regiment of the Chinese army's Lin Division and fled towards Tiegang Zuotan Foziao. When passing near Tiegang, it was ambushed on all sides by the Yun Regiment of the Chinese army's Zhang Brigade. The Japanese army was suddenly encircled and annihilated, scattering in all directions. However, the Chinese army had a tight arrangement and launched a fierce attack, and after three hours of fierce fighting, the Japanese army left behind a lot of corpses and luggage. The Chinese army followed up and attacked, and in the evening, attacked Zuotan Market again, engaging in hand-to-hand combat with the Japanese army. However, due to the threat of Japanese aircraft, it took the initiative to withdraw. On that day, many Japanese soldiers were killed. At present, fierce fighting is still taking place near Zuotan. It has been found that the Japanese armies in Zengcheng and Longmen counties rely entirely on the recently repaired Zenglong Highway for communication and transportation. In order to cut off the Japanese side's communication on this line, the Chinese army has launched raids on the strongholds along the line for several days, with great gains. On the evening of the 6th, the Liu Regiment of the Lin Division also attacked Zhengguo and Xintian in the northeast of Zengcheng and on the border of Zenglong. Because most of the Japanese army had been transferred away from Longmen, the defense was weak and it retreated to a corner. Chinese officers and soldiers often attacked into Zhengguo Market, destroying the Japanese radio station, armory, and command post separately, killing many Japanese soldiers. Soon, Japanese reinforcements arrived and fought back, and the battle became more intense. It was still in a stalemate until the morning of the 7th. At present, the Zenglong Road has been repeatedly damaged, and Japanese transportation is extremely difficult.</p>
<p>In the past week, the Chinese army on the West River West Route, taking advantage of the Japanese army's disastrous defeat in the north, has mobilized separately to launch attacks on the Sanshui, Nanhai, and Jianghui lines to cooperate in completing the offensive on the outer lines of Guangzhou's east, west, and north, and to launch a large-scale sweep of the Japanese army. Therefore, the battles on the front line are becoming increasingly fierce. Among them, the Zhang Division of the Li Group Army, which guarded the outer perimeter of Lubao, was ordered to attack Sanshui. For several days, it crossed the Lubao River and advanced fiercely, sweeping away the Japanese army on the outer perimeter of Sanshui. On the evening of the 7th, the vanguard had advanced to Sanshui City and engaged in fierce battles with the Japanese army in the Jichang and Baisha areas outside the north gate. The Chinese army used the darkness to launch a siege on all sides. After two hours of stalemate, the Japanese army could not hold on and retreated one after another. The Chinese army pursued closely, rushing to Dachi Gang in the near suburbs. The Japanese army initially attempted to resist, but the Chinese artillery team arrived to assist in the attack, and the infantry bravely charged and killed, defeating the Japanese army again. The remaining Japanese army fled into the city in embarrassment, stubbornly defending the city. As soon as a certain unit of the Chinese army arrived, it launched a large-scale attack on the county seat. As for the Lubao West Road, the Japanese army stationed in Xinan Town has recently feared a Chinese counter-offensive and has repeatedly invaded the Yangmei area, pretending to attack in order to defend. A certain unit of the Zhang Division has arrived at Yangmei Yigang and other places to sweep away the Japanese army that is scurrying about. At 1:00 PM on the 6th, it surrounded Zhangbian, south of Yangmei. More than 200 Japanese soldiers were attacked from all sides, suffering heavy casualties. At around 3:00 PM, they could not hold on and broke through to the south, retreating to Xinan Town. The Chinese army followed up with a fierce attack, killing more than half of them and seizing many rifles and other spoils of war. At present, the Chinese army is clearing the remnants and continuing to press Xinan. Therefore, the Japanese army is extremely panicked. On the 7th, more than 400 troops were sent from Foshan to Guantian to provide reinforcements, dividing the defense between Dangui Market and Yuelou in the near suburbs, preparing for a stubborn defense. Also, after the Japanese army suffered a major setback in the northern invasion, the Japanese army in various places in the West River was greatly shaken. In order to suppress military morale and contain the Chinese army's offensive, the Japanese command has held naval and military exercises for several days, taking the opportunity to send warships to spy on the counties of Gao Yao, Sihui, and Gaoming, making a false show of strength. Japanese aircraft also wreaked havoc everywhere. At 9:00 AM on the 6th, four Japanese aircraft took off from the River Mouth seaplane field, flew over Zhaoqing City, and attacked Deqing. Near Yuecheng, they dropped several bombs on civilian ships and strafed them with machine guns, sinking three civilian ships and killing or injuring more than 20 people. At noon on the 7th, two Japanese aircraft flew directly to Sihui Mafang and Dasha Liantang, etc. along the Gao (Yao) Si (Hui) highway to bomb, dropping eleven bombs, destroying more than 30 civilian houses and killing or injuring several people.</p>

<p>Jiashan Correspondence: On the evening of the 2nd of this month, about two miles outside the East Gate, there was a puppet self-defense corps, which was an intelligence team sent by the Japanese garrison. The Japanese garrison also said to the corps that if the guerrillas came, they would burn the prepared haystacks in the area as a fire signal. Unexpectedly, when the guerrillas advanced that night, they had already reached a compromise with the self-defense corps, so they did not set fire as a signal. Until the guerrillas approached, the Japanese army was caught off guard and had to retreat into the city to defend firmly. After an hour of mutual fire, the guerrilla team retreated. For a time, the residents inside and outside the city were particularly panicked.</p>

<h3 id="e34">Guilin Province Sets Relief Measures for Students from Fallen Areas; Tuition Fees Waived and Food Expenses Subsidized for Those with Economic Difficulties <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>(Guilin Correspondence) The Guangxi Provincial Government, considering that students in various secondary schools and above are experiencing great difficulties in supplying funds and are unable to pay tuition and food expenses due to their families being trapped in war zones or affected by the war, has specially issued temporary relief measures and instructed all districts to forward them to their subordinate county governments and all secondary schools and above for compliance. The original measures are as follows: (1) Students whose families are trapped in war zones and have difficulty supplying funds, after verification, will be exempted from tuition fees, and the required food expenses will be fully subsidized by public funds. (2) Students who are not able to receive family assistance due to the war, after verification, will be exempted from tuition fees and may be granted a discretionary loan for food expenses. (3) Students requesting subsidies or loans for food expenses should submit a written application to the school, detailing the reasons. However, those who have already received public funding will not be allowed to apply for subsidies again. (4) Each school should organize a committee to review and decide on the aforementioned requests. (5) All students receiving subsidies or loans for food expenses should issue receipts or IOUs, and the school should prepare a monthly roster along with the receipts and report them separately to the Prefectural Government or County Government for verification and forwarding (private schools should report to the Board of Directors). (6) The food expenses for the aforementioned subsidies and loans will be drawn from the school's surplus funds. If there is a shortfall, the school will apply to the Prefectural Government for additional funding. (7) Students receiving subsidies or loans for food expenses will be discontinued immediately if their families are already providing assistance. The loan amount should be repaid in full.</p>
<h3 id="e35">Guo Youshou, Director of the Sichuan Education Department, Reports on Education (3) <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>Elementary school teachers are graded according to qualifications. The monthly salary of the principals of central schools is at least thirty yuan. The monthly salary of the teachers of central schools and the principals of national schools is at least twenty-five yuan. The monthly salary of the teachers of national schools is at least twenty yuan. Those with good qualifications will be increased by grade, and those who are unqualified will be made to study and participate in examinations. At present, the number of qualified elementary school teachers in Sichuan is only one-tenth of the total, totaling more than 4,200 people. It is not difficult to increase the number. Whether this issue can be carried out smoothly still needs to be reviewed and the final decision will be made when each county budgets. Secondly, regarding the improvement of the quality of secondary schools, there are more than 200 public and private secondary schools in Sichuan. Except for Guangdong Province, no other province in the country has more than Sichuan. However, considering the population density of Sichuan Province, it cannot be said to be too many. At present, we plan not to expand the quantity temporarily, and strive to improve the quality. First of all, we will adjust the distribution of each school, and allocate them evenly according to the traffic conditions and population density of each place, dividing Sichuan into ten secondary school districts such as Chengdu, Zizhong, Leshan, and Mianyang. At the same time, a provincial normal school will be set up in each administrative district, and the funds for the jointly established district schools will be changed to be borne by the provincial government. All counties will be changed to provincial. As for the district agricultural and forestry schools, most of them have not been realized in the past. It has been decided to use 200,000 yuan in funding to establish five junior agricultural vocational schools. This plan has been gradually realized. As for the county secondary schools, preparations are also being made to gradually transfer them to the department's administration. Regarding vocational education, it is planned to set up short-term vocational courses in the factories that have moved to Sichuan, and negotiations are being conducted with the factories that have moved to Sichuan. It is hoped that after the technical employees of the factories that have moved to Sichuan return to the east, the province will still have talents to continue to run them. Finally, the private secondary schools in each county feel financially distressed, and we are now looking for ways to subsidize them in order to improve their quality. Thirdly, regarding the widespread establishment of central schools and national schools, this work is scheduled to be completed within three years, achieving one central elementary school per township and one national school per bao. Last time, when I was in Chongqing, I followed the instructions of Minister Chen of the Education Department and formulated nine principles, which were submitted to the acting chairman for approval. Generally, one central school will be set up in each township, which should not be a problem this year. As for the establishment of national schools, it is planned to proceed in stages. From July 29th to June 30th, at least one national school will be established for every two bao. From July 30th to June 32nd, one national school will be established for every bao. Before the implementation of this plan, the two major issues of funding and talent must be resolved first. These issues are currently being discussed in detail. The above is a brief report on several key tasks of this department this year. Finally, I would also like to say a few words about higher education in Sichuan. The subsidy for National Sichuan University is still included in the education and culture expenses. The School of Commerce of Chongqing University has now been formally established, and it is hoped that it will work hard to cultivate specialized talents and develop. The Provincial Education College will train specialized technical personnel for political construction and cultivate talents, according to the province's needs. The Provincial Government subsidizes West China Union University with 10,000 yuan every year, and it is hoped that it will develop more in the fields of dentistry and medicine. In addition, the Provincial Library has been formally established, and the Preparatory Committee for the Preservation of Ancient Artifacts and Literature is also being established. It is hoped that colleagues in the government will not hesitate to point out any mistakes and provide more support. After the speech, Secretary-General He led the reading of the Party Member Code of Conduct, and the meeting adjourned at 11:00 AM.</p>

<h3 id="e38">Second Hong Kong-Shanghai Interport Football Match: Lido May Face Hong Kong; Difficulties in Forming the Chinese All-Star Team; Change Under Consideration <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>Interport football matches, according to tradition, apart from the official interport match, the guest team will also play against the host team's Chinese All-Star team and Western All-Star team or Military All-Star team. However, this year there will be an unprecedented attempt, that is, a single club will face the team from afar. According to reports in Hong Kong newspapers, in the Hong Kong-Vietnam (Saigon) interport competition during the Spring Festival, the first match (9th) was Saigon vs. Eastern, and the third match (10th) was Saigon vs. South China. Unexpectedly, Shanghai, thousands of miles away, also has the same idea, that is, the original second interport match on the 10th, in which the Chinese All-Star team would face Hong Kong, will also be changed to Lido facing Hong Kong. This move was raised for discussion by a certain member at the first group meeting. The reason is that Hong Kong vs. Lido is more attractive than Hong Kong vs. the Chinese All-Star team. This is because Lido and Eastern China have different styles and it is difficult to have a tacit understanding. Lido is currently a regular in Group A and was also last year's Scott Cup champion. If a whole club faces the visiting team, they believe that the results are often better than the Chinese All-Star team, which is formed with difficulty. The members present at the time, such as Brett, Compton, and Little, all absolutely agreed. However, the Westerners have no opinion on whether to face the visiting team in the name of the Chinese All-Star team or in the name of Lido, and will listen to the Chinese side's appropriate arrangements. It is learned that some powerful figures on the Chinese side also strongly advocate that Lido face Hong Kong alone. This move not only shows the improvement of the visiting team's club level, but also competes with the Hong Kong-Vietnam interport competition held during the Spring Festival. In fact, Dai Linjing has already abandoned his football career in Eastern China, Jia Youliang's injury has not yet recovered, and Chen Hongguang will soon leave Shanghai. The only two who are qualified to be selected are Zhuang Youren and Qin Bigao. However, Zhang Linggen's skills are no worse than Zhuang's, and Lu Zhongen and Li Yichen are all experienced and have their own merits. Therefore, the idea of Lido facing the visiting team will be announced after some time and after careful consideration.</p>

<p>Inter-city football matches, Hong Kong vs. Shanghai have become a reality, and the two major competitions of Hong Kong vs. Vietnam and Hong Kong vs. Philippines. According to Hong Kong news, Hong Kong vs. Vietnam has also become a reality, while Hong Kong vs. Philippines has been called off due to the Philippine side's refusal. However, the Lunar New Year in Vietnam will be extra lively, as in addition to Hong Kong vs. Vietnam, there will also be a Siamese football team visiting. In Hong Kong and Shanghai, where transportation is convenient, there have been no two inter-city matches staged. Vietnam, which is located in a remote corner of the sea, has unexpectedly gained this benefit, which is also facilitated by the international situation.</p>
<p>Hong Kong vs. Vietnam inter-city in Hong Kong's itinerary: The Vietnamese side accepted Hong Kong's invitation. A certain ship of the Wo Fat Company will arrive in Hong Kong around February 7th (Lunar New Year's Eve), staying at the Seaview Hotel. However, the ship will only stay in Hong Kong for three or four days before returning south, so it cannot play three games, etc. The Hong Kong Football Association members are very excited that Saigon has confirmed its arrival in Hong Kong and are very confident in requesting the shipping company to extend the deadline for returning south. Therefore, they have arranged the New Year schedule and selected staff and the Hong Kong team to show their preparation. The match schedule is as follows: 8th (Lunar New Year's Day), Hong Kong vs. Vietnam inter-city match, Causeway Bay stadium; 9th, Saigon team vs. Eastern Athletic Association, Causeway Bay stadium; 10th, Chinese United vs. Navy and Army United, Caroline Hill; 11th, Saigon team vs. South China Athletic Association, Causeway Bay stadium. In the afternoon, the Hong Kong Football Association will host a banquet for the Vietnamese inter-city team. 12th, the schedule is undecided. 13th, the Saigon team departs from Hong Kong.</p>

<p>Since mid-month, Japanese troops have been harassing the coastal areas of eastern Zhejiang, shelling Longshan, Guanhaiwei, and other places. The details have been reported in previous newspapers. Subsequently, the Japanese troops in Hangzhou, taking advantage of the heavy snowfall on the 22nd at dawn, forcibly crossed the Qiantang River and landed near Xiaoshan. Ning-Shao compatriots residing in Shanghai were very uneasy after hearing the above news and sent telegrams to their hometowns to inquire. Speculators in the market also took advantage of this opportunity to become active. However, Ning-Shao was peaceful as usual, and the Shanghai-Ningbo shipping route was operating normally. The Wah Lun Shipping Company's Haida vessel set anchor at 3:00 PM yesterday and sailed to Zhenhai. The Sino-Italian Company's De Niu vessel, originally scheduled to return to Shanghai on the 22nd, was unable to load and unload cargo due to the heavy snow, so it could not arrive in Shanghai as scheduled. The vessel telegraphed yesterday, saying that it would definitely return to Shanghai tomorrow (the 26th), and the Dapu vessel would travel from Shanghai to Zhenhai on Saturday or Sunday (the 27th from Zhen back to Shanghai). Regarding the Japanese troops who forcibly crossed the Qiantang River, according to a certain shipping company's telegram from the Ningbo branch, "Fire in Linpu, our troops are encircling and annihilating, the enemy shows signs of retreat," etc. It is also reported that after the Japanese troops crossed the river, they advanced in two directions. One route invaded the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, but was met with a head-on blow by the Chinese army and showed signs of retreat. The other route attacked Shaoxing, encountering strong resistance at Keqiao, and is currently engaged in fierce fighting.</p>
<p>The Japanese Troops Crossing the River Are Already Unable to Hold On. Datong News Agency reports that the truth about the news of the Japanese troops in Hangzhou landing on the south bank of the Qiantang River only gradually became clear yesterday. The Japanese troops landed at the Six Hundred Mu Wharf and Huajia Village area along the river in Xiaoshan County on the morning of the 21st in rubber boats. They numbered only a few hundred men and are currently being blocked by local troops. The Japanese troops are already unable to hold on and are showing signs of retreating. The Japanese side's decision to risk crossing the river, although claiming that they would spy on Zhuji Fengqiao and the Shangjiang area from the Xiaoshan Riverbank to cut off the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, is actually only to cause harassment and will never succeed. According to the latest information from a Datong News Agency reporter, some of the Japanese troops who crossed the river have been defeated and fled back to the north bank. People in Shanghai and Zhejiang can be relieved.</p>
<p>Attempt to Invade Jinhua Will Definitely Fail. After the Shaoxing-based Shanghai Seven Counties Association telegraphed the Yuyao County magistrate to inquire about the truth of the Japanese troops landing in Xiaoshan, they received a telegram from the Yuyao China One Trust Company at 6:00 PM on the 23rd, stating, "Japanese troops have arrived in Xiaoshan, the situation is tense." According to a New Voice News Agency reporter's inquiry to relevant parties, Kanshan, which belongs to Xiaoshan County, has a beach near the river, which is Six Hundred Mu, 30 li away from Toupeng Town. The piers (i.e., beaches) along the river in the town are Sanche Wharf and Xiaojiao Wharf, both 6 li away from the town. There is a highway from Kanshan to Toupeng, which has now been destroyed. Defensive works have been built in Kanshan and Toupeng, and heavy troops are stationed there. On the morning of the 22nd, Japanese troops sneaked across the river to invade Kanshan, and the local garrison immediately dealt a heavy blow. At that time, there were more than 80 rubber speedboats and 6 Japanese planes providing cover. Many of them were sunk by the garrison. The artillery fire was very fierce at that time. The garrison resisted fiercely, with heroic sacrifices, and the Japanese troops suffered even more casualties. It is reported that the commander of the Third War Area has dispatched large forces to block them strictly. The Xiaoshao Highway is under strict guard. The local anti-Japanese self-defense corps has joined the resistance, and the provincial security team is also participating in the battle, so the military strength is strong. The Japanese troops' attempt to invade Jinhua along the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Road will definitely fail.</p>
<p>The Fire in Linpu Shows Signs of Improvement. Last night, a telegram from Ningbo came to Shanghai reporting, "The fire in Linpu is showing signs of improvement, and there is hope that the Japanese will completely withdraw." A New Voice News Agency reporter also learned from relevant parties that a part of the Japanese troops who landed in Kanshan, Xiaoshan, advanced towards the county seat of Xiaoshan after landing. Their vanguard troops were surrounded and annihilated by the Chinese army in the suburbs of Xiaoshan. The streets near Linpu Railway Station, the starting point of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Road, have been on fire, reportedly caused by Japanese planes bombing. It is also reported that a certain unit of the Chinese army has launched an attack on Toupeng and Kanshan to cut off the Japanese troops' retreat. Regarding the rumors that the two Chinese banks of transportation in Shaoxing have withdrawn to Shengxian, a New Voice News Agency reporter inquired with the two banks yesterday and learned that they had not withdrawn as of last night. However, the Japanese troops' invasion of Xiaoshan is indeed a fact. Shaoxing and Xiaoshan city are still peaceful and heavily guarded. Residents have inevitably been evacuated. Telegrams from Ningbo, Taizhou, Wenzhou and other coastal areas to Shanghai reported peace.</p>
<p>It Is Not Difficult to Annihilate the Landing Japanese Troops. After Linpu became tense, the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway was changed to start from Zhuji and continued to operate normally. Heavy troops are stationed along the line, with Linpu having the most. This is because the road is the only important transportation line from Xiaoshan to Jinhua. The highways from Xiaoshan to Shaoxing and Ningbo, and the Xiaoshao-Ningbo section of the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway, have long been completely destroyed. The mountains are densely packed everywhere, and it is by no means easy for the Japanese troops to attack Jinhua. Moreover, Kanshan in Xiaoshan faces Haining across the river, and the Qiantang River is 18 li wide, and there is a "Zhejiang Tide." Warships cannot sail, and rubber boats are not convenient for carrying heavy loads. Therefore, it is not difficult to annihilate the landing Japanese troops. According to a telegram received by the shipping industry in this city from Ningbo at 2:00 PM yesterday, "A large Chinese army is now departing from Jinhua and heading to the front line. It is heard that Liu Jianxu, commander-in-chief of the 10th Army Group, has arrived in Xiaoshan to supervise the battle. The Yongjin Highway is busy with military transport, and freight transport is completely blocked. All goods cannot be transported inland. Please stop loading immediately," etc. It is heard that there was an encounter battle near Anchang, which was extremely fierce.</p>
<h3 id="e44">Three Iron Gates in the French Concession Reopened Yesterday, Citizens Visit Former Residences with Mixed Feelings, Gambling and Prostitution Are Already Active <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>After the Japanese puppets in Nanshi announced the reopening of traffic in Nanshi east of the Rihui Port the day before yesterday, the French Concession authorities, in response to their request, opened the three iron gates at Xieqiao, Nanyangqiao and Xinqiao Street, which had been closed for two years, at the same time at 11:00 AM yesterday, allowing citizens to enter and exit freely. The Xin Kaihe side also remained open as usual, and the original place was exclusively for vehicles to enter and exit, while pedestrians took another iron gate to the north to ensure safety. If no special accidents occur in the future, it is stipulated that the iron gates will be open from 6:00 AM to 12:30 AM when the curfew begins every day. However, the Japanese puppets in Nanshi have a curfew from 7:00 PM to 6:00 AM. It is not yet known whether this will be lifted. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Continue to Open from Today. Because yesterday was the first day of opening, the opening time was after 11:00 AM. Those who went to the iron gates to inspect before 11:00 AM did not see the opening. The three iron gates were opened until 6:00 PM yesterday before being closed. They will continue to open from today.</p>
<p>Visiting Former Residences after the Robbery. Yesterday afternoon, someone went to Xieqiao, Nanyangqiao, and Xinqiao Street to inspect the three iron gates and saw that the residents entering and exiting the above three places were still crowded. The reason these people entered Nanshi was not to return as the Japanese hoped, but to visit their former residences after the robbery. Their hearts were sad, and they had mixed feelings. It goes without saying.</p>
<p>All Citizen Certificates Can Be Used. The Xinqiao Street iron gate originally had four doors, but only two were opened yesterday. The one on the east side was only for vehicles to enter and exit, and the one on the west side, opposite the French Concession morgue, was for pedestrians entering and exiting. Regarding the traffic issue, since the opening of the Xin Kaihe iron gate, only a few people holding citizen certificates from September or earlier could enter and exit, which was very inconvenient for the public. However, from yesterday onwards, anyone east of the Rihui Port can pass through with a citizen certificate without restriction. At the same time, the Nanshi Wharf and Pudong Yangjiadu were allowed to ferry across the river.</p>
<p>Chinese and Western Vietnamese Police Stationed for Inspection. The French police station sent French police, Chinese police, Vietnamese police, and female inspectors to guard each iron gate yesterday to selectively inspect residents entering and exiting and record the number of people entering and exiting. Judging from yesterday's situation, the order was still good.</p>
<p>Gambling and Prostitution Have Been Announced to Open. The original purpose of the Japanese puppets opening Nanshi was to revive the Nanshi market with gambling and prostitution. The so-called "Revival Committee" is a combination of Japanese puppets who collude to make profits. Yesterday, the three iron gates in Nanshi were opened, and the general hooligans and gangsters were overjoyed. Prostitution houses, gambling dens, and other places that have already obtained licenses from the "Entertainment Supervision Department" have announced their opening for business. Dozens of gambling tables will also be fully opened in the shortest possible time. It is expected that Nanshi will soon be transformed into a bizarre and evil den.</p>
<p>Occupied Vehicles Will Start Running Next Month. Under the control of the Japanese army, the private and publicly operated properties of Chinese in Nanshi have long been looted by the Japanese. The trams on all routes of the former Nanshi Commercial Electric Company and the public buses on all routes of the China Merchants Public Bus Company have been looted and repainted with Japanese trademarks by the so-called "Japanese-owned China Public Bus Company" and the Japanese "Thunder Vehicle Company" and are scheduled to officially start running from the first day of next month.</p>
<h3 id="e45">The People's Food Adjustment Association Urges Citizens to Join Group Rice Ordering as Soon as Possible, Ordering贡米in US Dollars at the Current Exchange Rate Still Pays Off, Hoping that Employees in All Industries Will Prepare Six Months of Rice <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai People's Food Adjustment Association issued a letter to the citizens yesterday, stating that since the establishment of the association, it has actively promoted the method of group rice purchase. The purpose is to (1) increase the source of rice and replenish Shanghai's rice reserves; (2) because the source increases and the rice reserves are sufficient, the demand will naturally decrease, and the rice price can be suppressed. The various sectors understand this meaning, and there are indeed many people who are enthusiastic about participating. However, there are also many people who are waiting and watching or are limited by their economic ability. Therefore, I will not hesitate to contribute a few suggestions in the following. I hope you will understand:</p>
<p>Rice Price Prediction (1) Due to various reasons, the rice price in Shanghai may continue to rise. I hope that people from all walks of life can purchase a large amount of rice as soon as possible while it has not continued to rise, so as to prepare for a rainy day. Then, the fear of rice shortage in the future may not occur. (2) I hope that all factories, shops, schools, and other groups and institutions can advance funds for their employees to purchase more than six months of rice reserves. (Saigon rice can be stored for two years without rotting.) All advances can be deducted from their salaries and wages separately and continuously. Such a method will not cause much loss to the factories themselves, but it will benefit all employees in terms of peace of mind. To seek labor-management cooperation, it is indeed a good opportunity. Not only that, at least two-thirds of the population of Shanghai is within the above-mentioned scope. If they can all be worry-free about rice for these six months, then most of Shanghai's food problem has been solved. And the remaining one-third of the population will also be unaffected by the high price of rice due to the large reduction in the need for rice on the market. Wouldn't the entire food problem be completely solved? (3) The Association also extremely agrees that all sectors can automatically raise enough money and order directly from foreign countries. The Association only hopes to increase Shanghai's rice reserves and has absolutely no intention of monopolizing the ordering of foreign rice on behalf of all sectors. However, there is one thing that must be mentioned, that is, I hope that all sectors will not purchase a large amount of rice locally in Shanghai. Because purchasing in Shanghai will not only fail to increase Shanghai's rice reserves but will also make Shanghai's rice reserves increasingly tight, which will be a great threat to the poor who eat by the liter. This must be paid attention to. (4) I hope that all industry associations can cooperate with the Association to persuade the member shops to understand the seriousness of the food problem in the future and the great impact on their industries. They should make a decisive decision and actively adopt the method of group rice purchase.</p>
<p>Rice Ordering Q&amp;A (5) To make it easier for all sectors to understand the method of group rice purchase, the common inquiries are answered as follows: (Q) Why order foreign rice? (A) Due to various reasons, the source of domestic rice is not smooth, so we have to order foreign rice with pain to increase the source. (Q) How many types of foreign rice are there? (A) Due to transportation reasons, the Association currently only plans to order one type of Saigon rice for the time being. However, Saigon rice is also divided into grades. The top-grade rice has only 25 grains of broken rice per 100 grains, and the rice is white, which is a very high-grade rice. The second-grade rice has 40 grains of broken rice per 100 grains and is for general consumption. The third-grade rice has 60 grains of broken rice per 100 grains, and a type of broken rice is mixed with the top two grades, which is mostly for the poor or the working class. Because it is not easy for the Association to accumulate enough numbers for those who recently entrusted to order top-grade rice and broken rice, so for the sake of convenience, we are now only ordering one type of second-grade Saigon rice. This type of rice is most suitable for middle-class people. (Q) How much does foreign rice cost per picul? (A) Because market prices often fluctuate and the exchange rate changes daily, the official price can only be determined when the registration has accumulated enough numbers and the official order is placed. The Association has planned to order two batches of Saigon rice. The first batch of 6,000 bags, each bag is about 1 picul and 2.5 dou, priced at 43 yuan, 8 jiao and 3 fen. The second batch of 10,000 bags, each bag is 48 yuan, 8 jiao and 3 fen. The first batch is about 35 yuan per Shanghai picul, and the second batch is about 29 yuan per Shanghai picul. However, one bag can still be sold for about 2 yuan in the market, and the cost of transportation to the warehouse, insurance, etc., is about 1 yuan and 8 jiao per bag. (Q) Judging from the current situation, ordering foreign rice is not cheap. (A) Because the current rice in Shanghai is still ordered at the previous time, when the purchase price was lower, so the selling price is also cheaper. However, this amount of rice is limited, and once it is sold out, there will be problems. The Association is aware of this, so it hopes that all sectors will order as soon as possible to prepare. The current exchange rate is very good, and the ordering time is excellent. If the exchange rate is tight in the future, even if the rice price does not rise, the additional exchange rate difference will be more expensive than now. (Q) Since the rice price in Shanghai is low now, why not purchase it in Shanghai as much as possible? (A) Because purchasing locally in Shanghai will not increase Shanghai's rice reserves, but will make Shanghai's rice reserves tighter, which has been explained in detail before. Therefore, not only is it not adopted by the Association, but it is also hoped that it will not be done by all sectors. (Q) What is the procedure for ordering foreign rice? (A) Those who order rice (1) should first go to the Association (Room 304, 3rd Floor, 59 Hong Kong Road) to fill out an application form, and then go to the Trust Department of Jin Cheng Bank on Jiangxi Road to pay a deposit of 20 yuan per bag as a formal registration. (2) The Association will wait until the registration has accumulated a considerable number before ordering from foreign countries on its behalf. The ordering time is usually three weeks. (3) Once the fixed rice arrives in Shanghai, the Association will warehouse it on its behalf and notify the rice orderer to bring the deposit receipt to the Trust Department of Jin Cheng Bank to pay the full price of the rice, receive the warehouse receipt and ship it. (Q) Does the People's Food Adjustment Association charge a handling fee to each fixed household? (A) Absolutely no fee will be charged. It is completely free of charge. The accounts of each batch of orders are open, and they are distributed to each fixed household completely according to the cost price. As for the directors, committee members, treasurer, secretary, and staff of the Association, they are all volunteers. Two or three clerks are hired, with very small salaries, and other expenses are also very small. For the moment, they can support several months without requesting subsidies from any party. 1,500 yuan has been donated by enthusiastic people in the Association.</p>
<p>Use of Funds (Q) Why does the People's Food Adjustment Association want to raise funds? (A) Because the Association must have considerable funds to achieve the purpose of true adjustment, for example, (1) when the rice price is low, it can use the funds to buy in, and sell it as usual when the price rises, then it can receive the effect of balancing the rice price. (2) When the fixed number of households is insufficient, and the rice price is suitable for falling at this time, or it is just the time when the exchange rate improves, if there are funds, it can be ordered in advance, or the exchange rate can be settled in advance to prepare. (3) Each decision to order rice, due to various reasons, is more convenient to purchase in large quantities as a whole. If there are funds, then even if the fixed households have odd numbers of bags, the Association can make up the whole number to order. In short, the effect of the funds is very much, although it is not enough to list them one by one, but even these few points have already shown its importance. Therefore, I hope that those who have already recognized the payment will pay it as soon as possible, and those who seek to recognize it will also actively participate. Moreover, the funds are only used as a temporary turnover chip, and they will still be returned in accordance with the regulations in the future. Therefore, it is also very different from the nature of general donations. The Shanghai People's Food Adjustment Association announced that, because of insufficient distribution, the customs authorities made an exception to recruit Japanese customs officers, totaling more than 30 people, to meet this need. According to reporters' inquiries with the customs yesterday, the number of Japanese personnel is now three times higher than before, increasing to hundreds of people, all of whom are assigned to work there. As for the Chinese customs officers who performed anti-smuggling duties in Yangshupu, Pudong, and other places before the war, and a part of those who withdrew from the mainland to Shanghai, they are now assigned to perform their duties as usual along the Huangpu River and Suzhou Creek in the concession.</p>

<p>The Continental News reports that when US Ambassador Johnson departs for Chongqing on February 8 after returning to Shanghai from Hankou, Mr. Haymick, the prosecutor of the US Court in China, will also accompany the ambassador to Chongqing. According to Mr. Hay yesterday (the 23rd), his trip to Chongqing is only to spend the holidays and has no important significance. On the way back to Shanghai, the court may be held in Guangzhou for one day to resolve minor cases, most of which are real estate disputes. In addition, there will be no official business on the way. It is possible that the court will be held in a certain place in the mainland to resolve disputes between American overseas Chinese, but it has not been decided yet. It is reported that the US ambassador and his party will depart from Shanghai, take a boat for six days to Hanoi, stay for one day, take a train to Kunming, which will take two days, stay for a short time, and then take a car to Chongqing, which will take four days. Mr. Hay will stay in Chongqing for five weeks and then take a plane to Hong Kong and then to Shanghai, and he will be able to return to the city around March 10. Mr. Hay's trip to Chongqing will be decided as the first time. Major McHugh, assistant naval attache, and Lafon, the ambassador's private secretary, will accompany the ambassador to Chongqing at the same time. As for Major Meyer, the army attache, he may not go to Chongqing until the end of this month. The above-mentioned people are now following Ambassador Johnson on the US gunboat Luzon on the way to Hankou along the river.</p>
<h3 id="e47">A Tour of the Three Iron Gates Opened Yesterday <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>— Yangtze River</p>
<p>Since the lone army that stubbornly defended Nanshi withdrew in tears from this ancient and historic city, the several iron gates connecting the French Concession to Nanshi have also been closed. For more than two years, these rusty, cold iron gates have become a gap between two different worlds of abnormal prosperity and special desolation.</p>
<p>Since the opening of the barbed wire frame south of the Xin Kaihe Water Tower on November 11 last year, the atmosphere of opening the other iron gates has been very noisy. Until yesterday, the Xieqiao and Nanyangqiao (the end of Minitney Road) and Xinqiao Street iron gates in the eastern district of the French Concession connecting Nanshi were finally opened at the same time.</p>
<p>Originally, many barbed wire, sandbag mounds, and other obstacles were placed on both sides of the iron gate. At about 10:00 AM yesterday, the patrolmen of the French Concession and the Japanese military police in Nanshi tried to remove them and opened the iron gate, divided into two traffic openings; one side was the "import" from Nanshi to the concession, and the other side was the "export" from the concession to Nanshi. Barbed wire frames were arranged in the middle, and the passing residents entered and exited on both sides.</p>
<p>The French Concession side stationed a dozen detectives and female inspectors at each iron gate to inspect residents entering the concession from Nanshi. Outside the iron gate stood equal numbers of Japanese military police and puppet police, strictly inspecting the residents passing through the iron gate and examining the fake "citizen certificates" in detail. However, the fake "citizen certificates" for October, November, and December, which were previously prohibited from passing through Xin Kaihe, could pass through the three newly opened iron gates yesterday.</p>
<p>After the robbery, Nanshi was unusually desolate. Yesterday, because it was the first day of opening, the residents entering and exiting were not very crowded. Most of them went to Nanshi to visit their former residences after the robbery, and some were refugees living in Nanshi who took the opportunity to visit the concession. At the same time, the iron gate opposite Tongren Fuyuantang on the east side of Xinqiao Street was also opened yesterday, but it was still blocked by an iron chain and was only used for vehicles to pass through, but the number of vehicles entering and exiting was very few.</p>
<p>The shops on both sides of Zhonghua Minguo Road, which is open in Nanshi, are still tightly closed, and the situation is very desolate. Several empty yards with broken walls and rubble have been repaired and decorated by the Japanese.</p>
<p>Recently, houses in various parts of Nanshi have been rented out, and many "clubs" and "paradises" are under construction in the Nine Mu Di area. A second "evil land" may appear here.</p>

<p>Since the Jianghai Customs resumed anti-smuggling work in Hongkou, Yangshupu, and Pudong in June of the year before last, Chinese customs officers have been inconvenient to go there to perform their duties under special circumstances, and the number of Western anti-smuggling customs officers is very small in the customs, and they are not divided, so the customs authorities made an exception to recruit Japanese customs officers, totaling more than 30 people, to meet this need. According to reporters' inquiries with the customs yesterday, the number of Japanese personnel is now three times higher than before, increasing to hundreds of people, all of whom are assigned to work there. As for the anti-smuggling duties and a part of the Chinese customs officers who withdrew from the mainland to Shanghai, they are now assigned to perform their duties as usual along the Huangpu River and Suzhou Creek in the concession.</p>

<p>According to the English-language *North China Daily News*, an English merchant ship sailing along the coast arrived in Shanghai from Tianjin on Sunday. It docked on the Bund outside the French Concession. Before [blank], customs inspectors boarded the ship for a search, finding no contraband. That night, a "Municipal Police Bureau" motorboat suddenly pulled up alongside the English ship, arousing suspicion among the customs inspectors. A second inspection was conducted, again without finding anything. The "Municipal Police Bureau" motorboat waited alongside the ship until about 5 a.m. yesterday (the 23rd), when thirty Chinese men emerged from the motorboat and carried off three sacks of opium from the English ship, totaling 280 pounds and valued at over 52,000 yuan. They returned to the boat and sailed to Pudong. After landing, they were suddenly confronted by twenty gangsters attempting to rob them. Those carrying the opium opened fire in self-defense. One gangster was injured in the left arm during the fighting. Eventually, both sides reached a compromise. The gangsters agreed to take one sack of opium, while the remaining two sacks were kept by the other party. They carried them to northern Pudong, crossed the river, and returned to Hongkou.</p>
<h3 id="e50">Four Germans, Stowaways on Japanese Ship, Removed and Housed in Shanghai <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>Turned Over to German Consul-General in Shanghai; To Be Sent to German Ship in Nanshi</p>
<p>According to the *North China Herald*, the Japanese freighter *Korushima Maru* (transliteration) arrived in Shanghai at 8:15 p.m. on Sunday, carrying four German stowaways. They were removed by the Water Police, quarantined, and handed over to the German Consul-General in Shanghai. It is learned that the four Germans were part of the crew of five German ships that sought refuge in Sabang, northern Sumatra, Dutch East Indies. It is believed that two of the five German ships taking refuge in the East Indies, the *Lindenhall* and *Monnelly Hall* of the Rickmers Line, and the rest of the ships of the HAPAG Line, had been in Sabang since the outbreak of the European War on September 3rd last year. The *Korushima Maru* freighter, with a carrying capacity of 3,000 tons, was chartered by Mitsui Bussan Kaisha, Ltd. to transport goods from Sabang to Shanghai. Before the ship set sail from Sabang, the captain discovered fifteen German sailors hiding on board, intending to stow away to Shanghai, and had them removed from the ship. The four men who arrived in Shanghai on Sunday were apparently discovered after the ship had sailed into the sea. The *Korushima Maru* first stopped at Keelung, Taiwan, en route. The captain intended to remove the four Germans from the ship, but the Keelung authorities refused. He had no choice but to continue carrying them to Shanghai. When the ship arrived in port on Sunday night and docked at buoys 15 and 16, the captain handed the four Germans over to the Water Police to be transferred to the German Consul-General. The four men were all young people of military service age. Their arrival in Shanghai brought the total number of German sailors in Shanghai to</p>
<p>ninety-two. The German freighter *Ramses* of the HAPAG Line, a 10,000-ton ship currently docked upstream of the Nanshi water barrier, already houses eighty-eight German sailors. The four German sailors who arrived in Shanghai on Sunday will most likely be sent to the *Ramses* to live until the end of the war.</p>

<p>Washington, 4th (United Press): Diplomatic circles here expect Lockhart, Counselor of the U.S. Embassy in China, to succeed Gauss as U.S. Consul-General in Shanghai, but this matter has not yet been decided. The State Department has also declined to comment. Other possible successors reportedly include Myers, Consul-General in Guangzhou, and others.</p>
<p>Appropriate Appointment</p>
<p>According to the *Continental Times*, yesterday (the 23rd), reliable sources reported that after the current U.S. Consul-General in Shanghai, Gauss, leaves Shanghai to take up a new post in Canberra, Australia, his vacant position will be filled by Lockhart, Counselor of the U.S. Embassy in Peiping. Mr. Lockhart is quite familiar with this position, as he came to Shanghai to serve as Acting Consul-General from May to August 1898, during Mr. Gauss's absence, and again last December when Mr. Gauss went to the Philippines for a [blank] conference.</p>
<p>Diplomatic Career</p>
<p>Mr. Lockhart was born in Pitsburg, Texas, USA, in 1881. He graduated from Grayson College. In 1900, he served as Assistant Editor of the Pitsburg newspaper. He then developed an interest in politics. In 1913, he served as Secretary to a Congressman and also worked in the Department of Agriculture. On July 29th of the following year, he became Assistant Director of the Far Eastern Division of the State Department, thus beginning his diplomatic career.</p>
<p>Embassy Counselor</p>
<p>In 19 [blank], he came to China on a special mission. He returned to his country in [blank] year. In 1925, he participated in the Peiping Tariff Conference. On April 15th of the same year, he was appointed Consul-General in Hankou. In 1922, he was transferred to Tianjin. In 1935, he was transferred back to Peiping to serve as Counselor of the U.S. Legation. In September of the same year, the U.S. Legation in Peiping was elevated to an Embassy, and Mr. Lockhart became the Embassy Counselor, a position he holds to this day.</p>

<p>The Shanghai All-Circles Commemoration Committee for Ma Xiangbo recently approved a suggestion from Preparatory Committee member Dai Chunfeng: "Among the Five Blessings in the *Hong Fan*, longevity is the most important. To nurture oneself to the age of one hundred is rare. Recalling that Master Ma Xiangbo was born in Danyang, he was uniquely blessed by Heaven. He founded Aurora University, and many people were educated by him. Moreover, his lifelong endeavors were based in Shanghai. After years of toil, and not long after moving to Liangshan, the star of longevity suddenly fell, and the world lost a role model. Consequently, there is no exemplary figure to inspire national strength and enlightenment. If we do not commemorate him, how can we encourage future generations? Furthermore, whenever the Master encountered famine and disaster, he always prioritized broad relief to help people. Having experienced great calamities in his youth, he was able to embrace all with compassion and was willing to be a renowned teacher. He also oversaw extensive translation work, commissioned by the National Government, fully embodying loyalty and integrity, practicing benevolence and righteousness, tirelessly working for a century, establishing virtue and words that will last for millennia. Now that the National Government has resolved to establish a Hall of Longevity, countless citizens of Shanghai, as students of the Master and as those who have privately admired him, and those who have received his education and benevolence, should also establish a Hall of Longevity. Ideally, it should be built in or near the Xujiahui Catholic Church area, to erect a hall and statue for the Master as a lasting memorial, shining brightly alongside Xu Guangqi. The people of Shanghai will surely support this initiative. I hereby suggest this to your committee for your consideration." The committee decided to submit the above suggestion for public resolution at the memorial service.</p>

<p>The houses in the Shouchun Lane area on Medhurst Road in this city are owned by Wang Zuoliang of the Shouchun Company. In June of last year, all tenants were notified of a proposed 30% rent increase starting in July, which was unsuccessful. Subsequently, the company entrusted lawyers Gu Changyuan and Xi Jien to represent them and sent letters to each tenant to comply. After failing to reach a mediation agreement in court, they filed a petition with the Shanghai First Special District Court, citing increased water costs as the reason, requesting a rent increase ranging from 38% to 50%. The tenants elected representatives from 57 households in the lane to jointly retain lawyers Shen Yide, Zhu Wende, and Xi Mengqi to respond according to the law. The case was heard on the 18th of this month by Judge Ni Zheng [blank]. The tenants argued that the value of real estate in the city had not increased, and there was no legal justification for a rent increase. After hearing arguments from both sides, Judge Ni scheduled the verdict for yesterday. Except for two households, Fu Ting and Luo Yunqing, who voluntarily agreed to increase their rent by five yuan each starting from [blank] month of this year, the landlord's request for a rent increase was rejected for the remaining 57 households.</p>

<p>To aid the poor, Moore Memorial Church on Yuqiaqing Road in this city began selling plain rice yesterday in the church's basketball court. The hours are from 11:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. daily. Retail buyers must first purchase a ticket at the ticket booth at the entrance, then collect the rice. Each catty is sold for one dime in national currency, or three bowls, each containing over four liang. The purchase quantity is temporarily unlimited per person. Yesterday and today, the amount of rice sold was two large buckets per day, each bucket containing two hundred catties, worth twenty yuan. However, according to those in charge, if the number of buyers increases in the future, the amount of rice sold can be increased at any time. As for the funding, it is entirely supported by voluntary donations from all sectors of society.</p>

<p>Last month, the Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department handled a total of 2,891 criminal cases, an increase of 335 cases compared to the previous month. At the same time, 2,203 criminals were arrested. In addition, 120 criminals who committed crimes in the previous month, as well as 28 suspects arrested on behalf of authorities outside the Settlement, were also apprehended. Ninety-five people committed crimes using firearms. Twenty-two firearms, along with a large quantity of ammunition, were seized. Among the recorded major crimes, there were five murder cases, fifteen attempted murder cases, two manslaughter cases, three armed kidnapping cases, and 137 armed robbery cases (a decrease of ten cases compared to the previous month). Twenty strike incidents occurred, affecting 8,787 workers. The factories where strikes occurred included two dyeing factories and two silk weaving factories, twelve other factories, and three major department stores on Nanjing Road. The Police Department's reserve team was dispatched six times last month, due to armed robbery, shooting and fighting, rice riots [blank], and strikes [blank]. Various police stations continued to carry out routine operations to crack down on loiterers, peddlers, and beggars obstructing traffic. A total of 893,678 passengers or pedestrians were searched at various docks, averaging 28,828 per day.</p>

<p>The area north of Sha Hai and Haimen was originally garrisoned by Chen Caifu's guerrilla unit. After repeatedly clashing with Japanese forces, Chen surrendered to the Japanese army. His unit was reorganized as a self-defense corps. Before long, they shot and killed a Japanese officer and several Japanese soldiers in Haimen. Angered by this deception, the Japanese army launched an attack. The Jiangsu Provincial Government dispatched the 2nd Brigade of the Provincial Security Force to Haimen to resist. Chen's unit was ordered to be transferred to Rugao for garrison duty. At the end of November of last year, the headquarters of the 4th Regiment of the 2nd Brigade of the Provincial Security Force sent a service member, Zhao Xuejin, to various places to recruit new soldiers. At the end of December, he led the twenty-four newly recruited soldiers aboard a ship to return to camp. Unexpectedly, they were captured by the Japanese navy on the ship and later taken to the San Chang for interrogation. It has recently been reported that Zhao has escaped, but the fate of the remaining twenty-four men is currently unknown.</p>

<p>After a sudden cold snap due to a high-pressure system from northwestern China, the weather in this city remained bitterly cold yesterday. At 5:00 or 6:00 a.m. yesterday morning, the temperature dropped to minus 5 degrees Celsius, or 23 degrees Fahrenheit, extremely cold. This caused thick ice to form on ditches, rivers, and water storage facilities. After advancing from the Yangtze River basin to Shanghai, the high-pressure system in northwestern China began moving southeast yesterday, apparently heading towards the East China Sea. Therefore, it is unlikely that this cold weather in this city will last long. The weather is expected to become slightly milder in the coming days. The temperature in Peiping yesterday was also only minus 6 degrees Celsius, comparable to the weather in southern China.</p>
<p>Piles of Frozen Corpses</p>
<p>Inland waterways have also become difficult to navigate due to thin ice. The number of ships arriving in Shanghai on the Suzhou Creek yesterday morning was very low. Moreover, the refugees wandering the streets, unable to withstand the onslaught of the cold, presented a pitiful sight. The number of corpses frozen to death on the streets has increased dramatically. According to Pushan Villa, a total of twenty-three corpses found on the streets were collected and buried the day before yesterday (the 23rd), as well as twelve corpses from refugee shelters and hospitals, and fifty corpses of children.</p>

<h3 id="e60">Grain: Wheat Rises to 20 Yuan; Flour at 10 Yuan is Rarely Available; The People's Food Prospects Become More Difficult <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's flour trading had reached a point where there were offers but no buyers. Although factories nominally maintained the original price of 10 yuan, it was difficult to purchase even small transactions of 300 to 500 bags at this price. The factories' main interest lies in profit, so why would they sacrifice it? Recently, they have become even more extreme, restricting sales to customers and also causing an invisible stagnation in retail transactions within the district. As a result, people are becoming increasingly panicked, and the seriousness of the situation is evident. This has driven rice prices to become increasingly firm and expensive. Yesterday, rice shops repeatedly had their requests to purchase ready-made flour rejected. There are rumors that the supply to this port is limited to 5,000 bags per day, which has yet to be confirmed, but discussions are rampant. It is said that yesterday, returned goods to the market were also held back due to the above situation. Only old cart stations were selling at 11.25 yuan. Foreign flour prices have reached 12 yuan, but there is still considerable supply. Even Japanese-made Phoenix brand flour is a rare commodity, and factories are even buying it back, a situation rarely seen. Since rice prices have become expensive, most people have been using flour-based foods to fill their stomachs. Now that flour prices are higher than rice prices, and even deep-fried dough sticks and large pancakes are unaffordable, the people's food prospects are becoming even more difficult.</p>
<p>Yesterday, wheat actually saw a new high price of 20 yuan, and transactions were very lively. Currently, factories are restricting supply more and more severely, and people's confidence is increasing. The general market is exporting three or four cartloads through the Shantou gang. The Japanese factories are handling more than ten cartloads through Xie Xing. The Chinese factories, Fuxin and Fufeng, are jointly handling 6,500 bags, with Suzhou-Wuxi wheat at 20 yuan, Zhenjiang wheat at 19.9 yuan, Yangzhou wheat also reaching 19.8 yuan, and Changzhou-Wuxi wheat at 19.6 yuan. The intensity of the price surge is unprecedented.</p>
<h3 id="e61">Rice Prices Remain Speculative; Wuxi Rice Prices Have Started to Decline Slightly <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>The previous rice market continued to decline. Yesterday morning, local shops took advantage of the low prices to make purchases, but the supply from inland areas suddenly became scarce, strengthening confidence. Prices immediately rose, and merchants revived speculative activities, causing the market to rebound. Various grades of thick japonica rice had limited transactions due to scarce supply, with middle-grade goods opening at 40 yuan and 39.67 yuan. Other, especially thin grades from Biaosi, opened at 40 yuan to 37.8 yuan. By the close of the market, prices had increased by two to three jiao compared to the previous closing prices. Special-grade Baiyuan goods were priced at 40 yuan to 39 yuan, but the middle-grade Danyang goods were popular, and the situation was tight. They opened high at 38.5 yuan, with guest rice at 37 yuan. Saigon and other foreign rice were selling well in inland markets, while there was only a slight bit of activity in the district, with transactions not exceeding 4,000 to 5,000 bags. Prices increased by three to five jiao. No. 1 Saigon closed at around 39.4 yuan, while No. 2 Saigon ranged from 38.78 yuan to 38.34 yuan, and Fire-pattern rice ranged from 38.12 yuan.</p>
<p>After increasing the water freight, foreign rice became more expensive due to the shortening of exchange rates. It became increasingly difficult to obtain high-end foreign rice. Yesterday, foreign merchants quoted Saigon broken rice at 37.5 yuan and 37 yuan, which was about 4 yuan higher than the 33 yuan of the previous week. Grain merchants found it difficult to obtain all the batches they telegraphed orders for. After a sharp rise, the suppliers of returned broken rice became even more speculative yesterday. Only 50 tons of road goods were sold in the general market. Currently, all grades of Saigon rice are uniformly demanding higher prices, but the willingness of importers to purchase is also waning, and prices are ultimately rising by two to three jiao.</p>
<p>Yesterday, another 1,824 bags of foreign rice arrived from Hong Kong on the Taikoo Company's Guangdong ship and are being unloaded.</p>
<p>Wuxi rice prices had recently risen sharply by three to four yuan due to large-scale purchases by Japanese merchants in Wuxi. Now, because the Japanese merchants also consider the prices to be too high, they have temporarily suspended purchases. They must wait for the contractors to clear the previous goods and make a conclusion before determining whether to continue ordering based on market conditions. However, the rice market tea parties have become abnormal, with prices rising by seven to eight jiao in a single day. On the 22nd, the opening price of white japonica rice was 23.78 yuan per stone, which was three jiao higher than the previous day. By noon, the willingness of factories to purchase had waned slightly, and most surplus profit merchants and hoarders were willing to sell. The market's willingness to purchase had changed to a wait-and-see attitude, and transactions became sluggish, with prices softening slightly by three to five jiao. Japonica paddy ranged from 11.3 yuan to around 11 yuan, while Baiyuan paddy ranged from 21 yuan to 21.67 yuan. The supply of Yuan paddy was endless, but the distilleries' sales were limited. Although the Lunar New Year is approaching, most lower- and middle-class families have economic difficulties, and sugar prices are high, so the customary practice of steaming cakes has become lukewarm. Glutinous rice has even less of a market. Due to the unauthorized price increases by fifteen rice mills, including Xingshun, etc., and not trading in the market as stipulated, they have been publicly discussed for punishment. Whether rice prices will rise or fall in the future depends on whether Japanese merchants and factories will resume frantic purchases. (Knowledge)</p>

<p>Yesterday's silk market seemed slightly stable. New York's near-term price rose by two points, and the far-term price rose by a small five points. Yokohama's spot price remained unchanged, and the far-term price fell by sixteen yuan. There were some export transactions in the local silk market, but the selling prices varied. On the same day, the same quality silk had a price difference of 100 to 200 yuan. Renchang and Lianna jointly purchased 50 loads of white factory silk, with prices ranging from 5,150 yuan to 5,300 yuan, which seemed to have stabilized compared to the beginning of the week. On the 24th, 306 pieces of tea leaves were shipped from Hong Kong.</p>

<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw no fluctuations in the HSBC exchange rates. The black market for British and American exchange rates had calmed down and returned to a state of fluctuation, with alternating gains and losses. The final tightening was minimal, mainly due to the supply from Hong Kong telegrams. There were no significant future news, and a return to relaxation was not difficult. The opening rates were flat, remaining at 4s 6.875d and 7.75 yuan. Later, because Sassoon continued to purchase February shillings and Chinese merchants also bought, the state tightened to 4s 6.40625d and 7.65625 yuan. Subsequently, a sudden influx of tens of thousands of pounds from Hong Kong telegrams, while buyers reduced their purchases, caused the market to immediately return to flatness. However, HSBC seized the opportunity to absorb, which caused the foreign firms to rush in, and the market image softened again, falling back to 4s 6.5625d and 7.6875 yuan. But Sassoon came to cash out its long positions for the month, and as the number of purchasers gradually decreased, the noon close was still at 4s 6.71875d and 7.71875 yuan. The result was a slight tightening of 0.015625d and 0.0315 compared to the previous day. The potential trend of futures was the same as that of spot.</p>
<p>Hong Kong Supplied Tens of Thousands of Pounds</p>

The banks' opening spot selling prices were 4s 6.875d for British gold and 7.75 yuan for American exchange, with no gains or losses compared to the previous close. After the opening, Sassoon first purchased February British gold at 4s 5.9375d, and speculators also simultaneously purchased February American exchange at 7.59375 yuan and 5625 yuan. At that time (9:20 AM), the spot prices also softened to 4s 6.40625d and 7.6525 yuan. HSBC's listing remained unchanged, and there was no increase or decrease in the silver equalization tax. Subsequently, a sudden influx of tens of thousands of pounds from Hong Kong telegrams caused the situation to return to flatness once. The sales to HSBC and other foreign firms were 4s 6.875d for spot British gold, and the spot American exchange also hardened to 7.75 yuan. Subsequently, due to the busy settlement of accounts by foreign firms and the cessation of supply from Hong Kong telegrams, it tightened and softened again. The foreign firms settled February American exchange at 7.625 yuan and March American exchange at 7.5 yuan. At that time, the spot prices tightened again to 4s 6.5625d and 7.6875 yuan. Later, Sassoon suddenly re-released February British gold at 4s 6.71875d. Transactions decreased at noon, and the market image gradually flattened.

<h3 id="e64">Tianjin Banks Poured Out; The Gold Market Wanted to Rise But Fell Instead <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's situation in the black market for spot gold bullion was barely satisfactory. According to the potential trend of the previous day, it was not unexpected for it to continue to rise by several tens of yuan. Unexpectedly, the result was a small decrease of over ten yuan. This was because foreign exchange continued to tighten by very little and entered a small fluctuating trend, causing many large households to be greatly disappointed. In addition, the continuous pouring out by the Tianjin banks caused confidence to reverse again. Although the Hong Kong banks came to search in the middle, the supply was no match for the demand, and it ultimately fell by thirteen yuan. The morning opening continued the residual momentum of the previous night, and with the exchange market reported tightening, it continued to rise by thirty-two yuan, reaching a peak of 4,160 yuan. It was heard that foreign exchange had returned to relaxation, and the multi-party was quite depressed. Retail investors came out in droves, and the securities banks replaced the Tianjin banks in vigorously supplying, and it immediately saw a fall, twice reaching 4,115 yuan. However, at this time, the exchange market suddenly tightened again, and it rose again to 4,140 yuan. Ultimately, because foreign exchange soon returned to hardening, and the Tianjin banks still had outpourings, and gold shops and money exchange businesses also came to compete in selling, although a Hong Kong bank commissioned a certain silver shop to buy over three hundred taels, it still resulted in supply exceeding demand. Until the noon close, it was only at 4,126 yuan. In the afternoon, the foreign exchange market was closed, and the fluctuations were quite flat, but the trend was weak. Although the Hong Kong banks continued to drag in, the floating multi-party had completed its settlement, so the evening close was only at the low price of 4,115 yuan. The total transaction volume for the whole day was about 1,300 to 1,400 taels. The silver shops' ornament silver decreased by a small five yuan, and the customs gold remained flat.</p>
<p>Bullion Fell by Thirteen Yuan</p>
<p>Since the early morning, for each bar (ten taels), the opening exchange market was reported tightening, and the sentiment was very strong. Money exchange shops, etc., raised prices to search in. The market opened at 9:20 AM, already made higher by thirty-two yuan. Money exchange businesses entered twenty taels of gold to the gold shop, for 4,160 yuan. Shortly thereafter, foreign exchange suddenly reported returning to hardening, and confidence frequently loosened. Many households that had made a profit came to take advantage of the high prices to supply out, and most buyers were at a loss, and it immediately decreased by forty-five yuan. Money exchange businesses output twenty taels of gold to the gold shop, for 4,115 yuan. At that time, a certain money exchange business saw an opportunity to scavenge in over one hundred taels, once pulling it up to 4,130 yuan. But ultimately, because the sellers were still pouring out, the securities banks sold a lot, and it returned to under 4,115 yuan. Subsequently, with the exchange market reported tightening again, the buying sentiment revived. A certain securities bank and various retail investors competed to first absorb, and it gradually rose by twenty-five yuan. The securities bank entered twenty taels of gold to the money exchange business, for 4,140 yuan. Thereafter, foreign exchange returned to hardening again, and the selling sentiment revived. A certain securities bank came again to supply out, and at the same time, a certain gold shop also sold, and it decreased again, stepping down fourteen yuan. The gold shop output twenty taels to the money exchange business, for 4,126 yuan. Later, a certain silver shop suddenly assisted the Hong Kong banks in vigorously entering several hundred taels, but the sellers' intention to supply was quite good, and only saw it raise by four yuan. A certain silver shop entered twenty taels of gold to the gold shop, for 4,139. Afterwards, the Hong Kong banks stopped entering, and it was immediately seen to return to 4,126 yuan, as the noon closing price. In the afternoon, the market trend was weak. The market opened decreased by six yuan. A certain silver shop output twenty taels to the money exchange business, for 4,120 yuan. Later, although a certain silver shop again assisted the Hong Kong banks in scavenging in over one hundred taels, the retail investors took advantage of the opportunity to unload, and the head position conversely felt that the supply exceeded demand, and it decreased by another five yuan. A certain silver shop output thirty taels to the securities bank, for 4,115 yuan, as the evening closing price. The result was that it decreased by thirteen yuan compared to the previous day. After the close, it was even lower by two yuan, for 4,113 yuan, and it was still difficult to find buyers. The total fluctuation was forty-five yuan. The selling price of the cash shop's own brand gold was several yuan higher according to the bullion, and the purchase price was reduced by twenty yuan. The current standard gold was over fifty yuan lower according to the listed gold, and there were few transactions.</p>
<p>Ornament Gold Decreased by Five Yuan</p>
<p>The silver shops' jewelry gold, when initially exchanging per tael, Datong Firm still suspended 410 yuan, until 2:50 PM, a small five yuan was suspended. The result was that Datong Firm changed to suspend 415 yuan. The new firms had the same prices as the above prices, and the purchase price was reduced by a small fifteen yuan in total.</p>
<p>American Gold Notes Alone Saw Loosening and Cheapening</p>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currencies, the British and American gold pounds, the need was gradually easing, and the market situation was stable. The supply and demand trends for British and American gold notes diverged. The British gold notes were stable in the morning, and the need in the afternoon was quite strong, and the market price rose again. The evening market was 47.5 yuan. The American gold notes were quite outstanding initially, and the market price rose to 12.96 yuan. Unfortunately, the customers supplied out due to profits, and the market situation gradually loosened and softened. The evening market decreased to 12.78 yuan, conversely being weaker than the previous day. The Hong Kong notes continued to be popular because of the sparse supply. The Dutch, Annam, and Robby notes were quite strongly needed, and all showed an increase. The Indian notes had a sparse supply and an increased need, and the market price sharply increased. The need for the Japanese gold notes had eased, and the market situation gradually weakened. The evening market was 1.263 yuan. The Korean notes also decreased to 1.035 yuan in the evening. Yesterday's market prices saw British gold notes increase by five jiao, American gold notes decrease by seven fen, Hong Kong and Annam notes increase by two fen each, Dutch and Robby notes increase by one jiao each, and Indian notes increase by three jiao. The other currencies had no changes.</p>

<p>Yesterday's market situation for securities in the black market first fell and then returned, and the trend turned chaotic. The multi-party was unwilling to sacrifice because of the interest relationship, and the empty-party was able to use all sorts of rumors. But in reality, the rise and fall of the bond market thereafter should depend on whether investors can develop interest. Yesterday morning, those tightly held such as Hengfu, Hongkang, and No. 7 were first released. There was not much need for Tiansheng, Xieda, etc., and the market price gradually weakened. Although Lianyi, Daqing, and No. 38 still had purchases, the unloading of retail investors was not weak. In the afternoon, Xinfu No. 35 and Lianyi, etc., continued to have purchases, and No. 38 and Tiansheng both had outputs. No. 24 and Lianyi also had sales, and the market price was stable. After entering, Sankaifeng, Datong came to acquire, and Hongda and Yongkang had a relatively sparse supply, and the prices slightly increased. Thus, the resulting market prices were seen to be mutually high and low. Class Ding alone was good by three jiao at most, Class Bing was slightly good by five fen, and the remainder still contracted by a small five fen to two jiao. The total transaction volume was about over 700,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below:</p>

<p>The yarn market remained quiet and stable. The sales of existing yarn continue unabated in the small transactions of the Hong Kong banks. The Tianjin banks slightly acquired coarse yarn, but the amount was very small, so confidence was still able to be maintained. The three major overseas cotton markets have been falling more and more fiercely. However, foreign exchange has tightened again, offsetting each other, so the market has not been affected and remains stable. The majority of psychological is bullish. However, there are quite a few people who have a lot of chips and are selling off February futures.</p>
<p>The spot cotton opened in the morning because the exchange rates had been changed to contraction on the afternoon of the previous day, and the miner's sentiment was quite outstanding. There were more buyers' thoughts, so although the foreign cotton fell sharply, it did not hurt. The asking price for 20-count Shuangma was 734 yuan, up one yuan from the previous day. After a while, it was heard that foreign exchange had continued to tighten, and the buying sentiment revived, and the market situation slowly rose. The 20-count Shuangma rose to 737 yuan.

<p>The Overseas Cotton Market's Falling Trend Turned Fierce</p>
<p>The Domestic Cotton Is In A State Of Stagnation</p>
<p>The transaction of the domestic cotton was exceptionally silent. This was because the end of the year was approaching day by day, and most people were preparing to collect the accounts and close the books, and business became clearer. In addition, the overseas Indian and American cotton markets had a fierce falling trend, causing people to wait and see. However, the wind of exchange contraction revived, and the two currently offset each other, so business stagnated. The source from Northern Jiangsu was estimated to be 1,142 bales of Tonghua. The current spot cotton transaction situation is recorded on the left.</p>

Indian including predictions fell by six rupees, Egyptian fell by forty-fifty pounds, and Liverpool fell by over twenty pounds.</p>
<p>The trading of foreign cotton in Shanghai port had shown a more active state in the previous few days. Recently, suddenly due to the tightening of exchange rates, transactions have turned quiet. In the past two days, also due to the fierce fall in the overseas cotton market, fellow traders, those who have hands in goods, are unwilling to sell cheaply. Moreover, they had already raised the funds, so they intend to wait quietly until after the New Year before discussing transactions again.

<h3 id="e67">Oil Market: Bean Oil Hoarders Rise Again <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>The bean oil market situation turned to show an upward trend, but the fluctuations were still uneven. The reason is that the district's graveyard has always taken the bean oil industry market prices as the standard, so at this time, near the end of the year, it is unwilling to have a cold market, causing the sellers to take advantage of the opportunity to reach for scarcity and intentionally raise the price. Thus, the market situation turned up. Looking back, the barrelled oil still opened at the original price, but the potential trend of the overall situation could not avoid being slightly affected, so the hoarders were quite active, settling for the purchase of 7-800 barrels of Dalian crude oil, with a price of 97.5 yuan for the original price. The Changzhou factory's barrelled oil for the second lowering of the barrels, with a price of 97 yuan, and 50 pieces of Jiaozhou oil, with a price of 73 yuan. The peanut oil export banks are still unmoved, and the purchase appetite in the district has also turned weak, so although the market price has continued to increase, the overall situation has a sign of turning firm. Yesterday, only 30 barrels of Tianjin barrelled oil were traded, with a price of 102 yuan, and 80 barrels of Qingdao road goods barrelled oil, with a price of 104 yuan. Also, 80 barrels of raw oil, with a price of 104 yuan. Also, 380 cans of raw oil are being shipped to Hong Kong today.</p>
<p>Also, 1,450 bags of soybeans and 520 bags of raw kernels are being shipped to Hong Kong.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the cloth market slightly loosened, because Eastern Zhejiang issued a warning, and the Ningbo and Shaoxing banks stopped transacting and loading. The various goods already entered had slight re-sales, but the purchasing appetite of the Guangdong and Hong Kong banks had more development than before. Because the foreign exchange market turned tight, the Eastern piece goods increased in price, so people's hearts were uncertain, and the selling price showed a fluctuating state, and the increase and decrease were very slight. Nearly 100,000 pieces of existing gray cloth and February-March futures were transacted in the district. The Guangdong banks transacted over 200 pieces of bleached cloth, colored cloth, colored twill, coarse and fine cloth. The Guangdong and Hong Kong banks transacted over 100 bales of coarse twill and coarse cloth. The Tianjin and Yu-Lu (Henan-Shandong) banks transacted over 8,000 pieces of blue cloth, coarse cloth, and poplin. The Nanyang banks transacted 50-60,000 pieces of bleached cloth, bleached twill, and red foreign labels, etc. Also, 164 pieces of cloth are being shipped to Hong Kong today.</p>

<p>Free Talk</p>
<p>A Small Discussion</p>
<h3 id="e73">The Scholar Goes Out! <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>— Huang Jiayin</p>
<p>"The scholar doesn't leave home, yet knows the affairs of the world."</p>
<p>Using this sentence as an advertisement for newspapers or magazines might be clever, but this one sentence has misled countless modern Chinese "scholars."</p>
<p>Sitting on a comfortable sofa, flipping through newspapers and magazines, one can indeed know a little about the great affairs of the world. However, living in the 20th-century society, simply "knowing" about world affairs is not enough. We should have a more in-depth observation and a clearer understanding. We should be able to analyze and explain. To understand the trend of contemporary social history, simply knowing a little about the facts is definitely not enough.</p>
<p>Prices have risen, and the lives of ordinary people have become even more difficult. Therefore, modern "scholars" write a lot of sentimental articles in a classical style. The subject matter is good, and the writing is also good, but they are often not moving enough, not profound enough.</p>
<p>Why is this? I say it may be because of the "scholar doesn't leave home" relationship, resulting in a bit of detachment from the lives of ordinary people.</p>
<p>To understand the great trends of the world, to recognize the face of society, to determine the trend of history, our scholars must go out, visit factories, prisons, interview slums, shelters, and "not be ashamed to ask," talk to dockworkers, newsboys, typesetters, rickshaw pullers, and any other compatriots who do the most basic grassroots work in society. Only such scholars can truly know the affairs of the world.</p>

<h3 id="e74">Prison University <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>— Wenhe</p>
<p>The "Free Talk" of January 20th said: "…Like the current situation of indiscriminately locking up all 'social sinners' together, and releasing them when their 'sentence is up,' leaving their future life and death to their own devices, isn't this akin to burying one's head in the sand?" But there are prisons in the world that care about the happiness of prisoners, such as the Pretoria Central Prison in the Union of South Africa, which is introduced here.</p>
<p>This prison is the only one in the Union of South Africa that imprisons long-term European offenders. In order to enable prisoners to make use of their long-term imprisonment, the prison authorities provide them with opportunities for further education. Prisoners can read in prison, study at correspondence schools, and the prison also employs teachers, and prisoners can attend their classes.</p>
<p>Their goal is to participate in the open entrance examinations and degree examinations of external universities. One prisoner serving a seven-year sentence passed the entrance examination in prison and is now studying for a degree in prison. Another, also serving a seven-year sentence, already has a Bachelor of Arts degree and has been approved to study business courses, hoping to obtain a business degree in two years.</p>
<p>Prisoners who only have a secondary school education are diligently seeking to pass the university entrance examination. Several prisoners convicted of fraud are studying administration and business courses. One prisoner, sentenced to seven years' imprisonment for murder, arson, robbery, theft, etc., has his first goal to pass the entrance examination, and later wants to study mining and engineering in prison.</p>
<p>Since this prison implemented this method, order has greatly improved. Prisoners preparing for exams are willing to abide by prison rules, and their behavior is comparatively more disciplined. However, studying inevitably costs money, and many prisoners, although ambitious, are inevitably hindered by economic difficulties. The 'Prisoner Welfare Fund' can provide a portion of the subsidy, and there are also donations from outside, but it is still not enough. The biggest obstacle to this approach is still the issue of surplus money.</p>
<p>Although prisoners study, they still have to do ordinary prison work. They leave the prison at 7:00 a.m. to work and do not return until 5:00 p.m. There is a lunch break in between, and many prisoners make good use of this time. The prison authorities also have preferential measures for studying prisoners. The lights are usually turned off at 9:00 p.m., and prisoners have ample time to study in their cells.</p>
<p>This method works very well, and prisoners clearly benefit from it. Pretoria Central Prison is one of the best-managed prisons in the world, and they are now working hard to find suitable jobs for their qualified released prisoners.</p>

<h3 id="e76">The Misfortune of the European Paradise <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>— Shi Shuang</p>
<p>Another Group that Hates the Nazis</p>
<p>The climate is warm, the scenery is beautiful, and every mountain and lake has a captivating charm. It is the European paradise—Switzerland, and also the ideal land of peace for people all over the world. Peace, tranquility, and beauty often fill this small country. However, after the outbreak of the Second European War, on September 5th of last year, Switzerland also quickly declared a national mobilization. Although it is a permanently neutral country, it is also a country where all people are soldiers. Guns, helmets, military uniforms, etc., are placed in every family. Therefore, as soon as the radio reported the government's call-up order, the people put on their military uniforms and rushed to report. The shortest assembly time for the troops was only two and a half hours. It has now mobilized 500,000 soldiers, a number that is certainly not large in other countries, but in Switzerland it already accounts for 12.5% of the country's population. Her main force is concentrated in Basel at the northwestern end, which is a city bordering Germany and France. The Rhine River has Germany on its right bank and France on its left bank. Switzerland straddles both banks of the Rhine. If the German and French armies both hate the frontal conflicts of the Maginot and Siegfried Lines, then they have to cross the Netherlands, Belgium, or break through Basel in the south.</p>
<p>Of Switzerland's four million people, seven-tenths speak German, two-tenths speak French, and those who speak Italian and Swiss dialects account for only one-tenth. Judging from this, it should be very close to Germany. However, unexpectedly, since Germany annexed Czechoslovakia last year, Switzerland has completely become anti-German. Her troops are concentrated in Basel, on the one hand, stemming from anti-German sentiments, and on the other hand, because Germany may invade Switzerland, it is very clear that the main purpose of military defense is to completely deal with Nazi countries.</p>
<p>The mobilized soldiers in Switzerland have a vacation once every two weeks. Returning from the border areas, one can see grassy military uniforms everywhere on the streets of Switzerland. Each soldier costs ten Swiss francs a day. Switzerland, with five hundred thousand soldiers mobilized, has to spend five million francs a day. Last year, Switzerland's military burden per person was 100 francs, but now it costs 450 francs. On the other hand, because the mobilization accounts for more than one-tenth of the population, the production capacity has to be greatly reduced, so the general Swiss petty bourgeoisie is also in a state of anxiety.</p>
<p>Switzerland ranks only after the United States and Britain in the total amount of gold reserves in the world. It is a world-famous "bank country." They have now transferred a portion of their gold reserves to the United States, and another portion is stored in mountain tunnels. Moreover, many shelters have been built near the tunnels, so that people will never think that there is brilliant gold underneath. At the same time, they also put food in armored vehicles and sink the armored vehicles in the center of lakes scattered throughout the country to prepare for future food shortages.</p>
<p>Refusing Reporters Entry</p>
<p>So far, Switzerland has issued more than 150 wartime decrees, many of which are related to suppressing spies. During the First World War, Switzerland simply became the center of clandestine activities for spies from various countries. This is a situation that can hinder neutrality, so Switzerland is now strictly implementing telecommunications, telephone, radio, and other communications controls, and there are stricter restrictions on foreigners entering the country. Swiss maps are generally not allowed to be carried. During the last World War, spies from various countries mixed into Switzerland under the guise of journalists. Therefore, in this European War, Switzerland ruthlessly refuses all news reporters to enter the country. Switzerland was a free country with democratic politics, but now, due to the war, it has become an unfree country.</p>
<p>Cultivation</p>
<h3 id="e77">Construction of the Mind <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>— Wu Wenbin</p>
<p>During the Ming Dynasty, Yang Jisheng, who impeached Yan Song, once said these few words: "The mind is the master of the person's entire body, like the root of a tree, the stem of a fruit, and it is most important not to damage the mind first. If the mind contains the principles of heaven and justice, then what comes out will all be good things, and you will be on the side of the gentleman. If the mind contains human desires and selfish intentions, even if you want to do good things, there will be no beginning and no end, and even if you want to be a good person on the outside, you will be seen through, just as the root decays and the tree withers, and the stem rots and the fruit falls." These words are a penetrating criticism for those with treacherous minds. If we want to be upright people, we must first build our minds with righteousness and candor, so that we are worthy of being true people.</p>
<p>There was once a university student in Beiping who worked as a clerk in a foreign firm, but secretly became a kidnapper, tore up the ransom note, was arrested, and sentenced to death. In his letter to his wife, he wrote: "My crime and my death are all due to my cleverness. I hope my son will not be sent to school in the future, lest he follow in my footsteps." How absurd! Where did his cleverness mislead him? I say he himself misled his cleverness. Since you have intelligence, you must be able to control it and use it. Why did you misuse it? Undoubtedly, it is because he lacked inner cultivation. In other words, he lacked the construction of his mind, so he caused this tragic mistake! Mr. Sun Yat-sen said: "Revolution must first revolutionize the mind." This is a treatment for the symptoms. If we want to be people, we must first build the mind…so that we are not tempted by general heresies and desires.</p>
<h3 id="e78">Alienation <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>— Guo Ziqing</p>
<p>Invisible lines string people together. So say social scientists. But I am quite amazed at the vast distance between people's feelings. One soul to another, like one planet to another. Never connected. (I can't find the tools to connect.)</p>
<p>So I say: "Alienation is an unavoidable existence in the world."</p>
<p>"No, your view is too pessimistic," a friend retorted. "First, you have to take off your colored glasses."</p>
<p>"Then, can you tell me what is the bridge that connects people?"</p>
<p>"Nothing else, just life. You can't just look for chance to cast a conclusion. But time and space often alienate people."</p>
<p>I fell into speechless contemplation again.</p>

<p>The grandson of the great Russian writer Tolstoy, Ivan Tolstoy-Bel, has joined the French Navy.</p>
<p>Germany has several hundred giant beasts, all of which have been shipped to Russia. These giant beasts were originally in German zoos, but now the Germans are afraid they will starve to death, so they are fostering them in Russia.</p>
<p>Everyone in Britain has a set of gas masks issued by the government. However, children find gas masks terrifying, so the government has specially manufactured a large number of new masks, specially distributed to babies around two years old. These masks come in several colors and look like Mickey Mouse, so their name is also called "Mickey Mouse Masks." The problem now is that the children refuse to wear them properly and treat them as toys.</p>
<p>"Living ghosts" have been discovered in two places in Britain. These living ghosts appear after the lights are turned off during the blackout, wearing white robes, making strange noises in their mouths, and scaring pedestrians. Many women and children have become ill as a result. These living ghosts are mostly disguised by local ruffians and hooligans. The police authorities have begun to investigate and will not forgive their pranks.</p>
<p>General Goering is said to be most fond of wearing medals, but recently a new batch of medals has been issued in Germany, but Goering did not receive one. This medal is specially awarded by Hitler to those who have contributed to the construction of the "West Wall" (i.e., the Siegfried Line). A total of six civil and military officials were awarded.</p>

<h3 id="e80">The Influence of Movies on People <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>— Xinliang</p>
<p>In Mr. Shou Xun's article "Practicing the Cloth Garment Movement," I read these two sentences: Ordinary young and young mistress-style movie fans pay extraordinary attention to the clothing of movie actors and follow suit. Indeed, none of us can deny that the impact of movies on the audience is really too deep and too great. Not only in clothing can it be said to be so, even in any other behavior, hobby, or personality aspect, movies can give us a huge impact.</p>
<p>According to the American "Current History" magazine of a certain month last year: Young men and women in New York City, even children, have a great interest in movies. They are happy to learn the style of those red stars, wear the clothes they wear, perm the hairstyles they perm, and love everything they love.</p>
<p>Since Norma Shearer played in "The Barretts of Wimpole Street," every barbershop and beauty salon in New York has competed to promote the "Juliet" hairstyle that Norma wore in the film; when Claudette Colbert's "Cleopatra" was released, those crazy men and women shifted their interest to "Sasha." Similarly, clothing is also like this. The novel and glamorous clothes in "The Women" of MGM really don't know how many young people they have sensationalized.</p>
<p>It is said that since the release of "Robin Hood," the business of bows and arrows toys in stationery stores in New York City has unexpectedly improved. In addition, don't we often see things like "Shirley Temple Dolls," "Snow White Soap," and "Flower Girl Perfume" in department stores? Whatever the item, as long as it is crowned with the name of a movie or a star, its business will naturally flourish.</p>
<p>We can probably also hear sayings such as "Because Mickey Rooney likes to play ball, so I also like to play ball," etc. In short, movies can indeed change a person's life and hobbies.</p>
<p>Because of this, we must be very careful when shooting each film. Even if it is a very small action, an extremely unimportant paragraph, they must make it perfect before they are done.</p>

<p>Alice Faye's Autobiography</p>
<p>Alice Faye was only a third-rate actress three years ago when she was filming "Little Miss Marker," "Sing, Baby, Sing," and other films, but now she has become one of Hollywood's most famous singers. According to her, her success is due to adhering to the following eight secrets: (1) Don't underestimate your talent. (2) Don't sing high notes. (3) Forget yourself, your clothes, etc. (4) Don't panic. (5) Think before you speak. (6) Prepare the plot before filming. (7) Forget your mistakes. (8) Have confidence and courage.</p>

<p>— Su Shaoqing</p>
<p>Yellow Crane Tower (Part 1)</p>
<p>The drama "Yellow Crane Tower" tells the story of the negotiations between Wu and Shu over Jingzhou. Zhou Yu invited Liu Bei to a banquet across the river, and demanded the return of Jingzhou during the banquet. Bei was at a loss for words and could only kneel down and beg. If not for Zhao Yun's eloquence and great fearless spirit, Liu Bei would have been forced to sign the treaty of Yellow Crane Tower, which would have ceded power and humiliated the country. Before leaving, Zhuge Kongming gave Zhao Yun a bamboo joint, which was Zhou Yu's order to open and read in case of extreme difficulty. (This arrow of command, Zhou Yu said to Lu Su in the play, was the order that Kongming used to borrow the wind from the South Screen and forgot to return. The loopholes in the Romance of the Three Kingdoms, or the homeless characters, are often asked and debated in society as a joke. The playwright finds this section to use as the dramatic hook, which is extremely interesting.) He then held the command and escaped. Zhou Yu was furious, and Doctor Lu was reprimanded. If the water battle and Reed Catkin Beach are also performed, it would be lively and worth watching. According to the Three Kingdoms plays performed in the play, most of the materials are taken from the Romance, but the plot of "Yellow Crane Tower" is not found in the Romance. If the play is performed by skilled performers, one person with one face, one person with one expression, and each person's personality is completely revealed, it is very good to watch. Tracing back to its origin, it all depends on the playwright's ingenious mind, and the wonderful thing is that a command arrow is hidden in the bamboo joint, which serves as the hook of the whole play. Thus, the whole play is alive, creating many interesting points. The author really knows how to write articles out of nothing.</p>
<h3 id="e83">The Huge Momentum of "Gone With the Wind" <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>— Yuangu</p>
<p>American female writer Mitchell's world-shaking novel "Gone With the Wind" has sold more than 1.78 million copies and has been translated into sixteen languages. Moreover, the film based on this novel has already been screened in the United States.</p>
<p>The screening location of this film was at the Loew's Grand Theatre in Atlanta, Georgia, on December 15th of last year. On that day, the stars of the film, Clark Gable, Vivien Leigh, Leslie Howard, Olivia de Havilland, etc., paraded through the city, so the people of Atlanta and the entire state of Georgia were as excited and drunk as if they were in a dream because of this film.</p>
<p>This film was directed by the famous producer David O. Selznick with all his efforts. He purchased the filming rights to "Gone With the Wind" in July 1936 for $50,000. At that time, this novel had just been published. The filming rights were in hand, but who should play the main characters inside? Clark Gable's role as Rhett Butler was unanimously agreed by movie fans as the most suitable, but the role of the female lead Scarlett O'Hara was difficult to find. Many actors were not suitable. Finally, British actress Vivien Leigh toured Hollywood and was seen by Selznick, who hired her.</p>
<p>The director of this film was also very difficult to find. First, George Cukor was invited. This gentleman was the director of "Camille," "The Barretts of Wimpole Street," and "The Women." His technique was delicate, but lacking in grandeur. Then, Victor Fleming—the director of "Captain Courageous" and "The Wizard of Oz"—was replaced, but he and the female lead Vivien Leigh did not get along well and often quarreled, so he could not continue to serve for a long time. Finally, Sam Wood, the director of "Goodbye, Mr. Chips," was invited, and only then was he able to complete this film.</p>
<p>The entire film is in color and cost a total of $3.98 million. In film history, only two films have cost so much: one is the air combat film "Hell's Angels," and the other is the Jewish historical film "Ben-Hur." According to American public opinion surveys, the box office of this film will definitely break the record of "Snow White."</p>

<p>Drama Communication: Recently, a certain gentleman pioneered a drama communication agency, specializing in sending various entertainment news. Manuscripts are sent out every other day, and photos are provided. The organization is very sound, and it is scheduled to be formally established in mid-February.</p>
<p>Volunteer Peking Opera: The Peking Opera section of the Shanghai Municipal Council's Chinese Staff Club, in order to raise funds for adult voluntary education expenses for the Shanghai Shenzhou Night School and donations for the North China flood, is scheduled to hold three nights of volunteer performances at the Golden Theater on February 1, 2, and 3. The program is as follows: First day (February 1) "Eight Righteous Figures," "Wu Jia Slope," "The Woman Escorted," "Two Visits to the Palace," "Fen River Bend," "Heroic Righteousness"; Second day (February 2) "Stabbing the Daughter-in-Law," "Mother Xu Scolds Cao," "The Lotus Lantern," "Rainbow Pass," "The Romance of the Spring and Autumn," "Cosmic Peak," "Evil Tiger Village," Third day (February 3) "Running the City," "Playing the Flower Drum," "June Snow," "Arresting and Releasing Cao," "Hammer Shakes Four Flat Mountains," "Teaching the Son," "Three Forks." It is also learned that all the tickets, under the promotion of the initiators Yu Qiaqing, Yuan Ludeng, Xi Yushu, Jiang Yiping, and Guo Shun, have been mostly sold out.</p>
<p>Publication of Famous Songs: Paramount's new film "Seventeen," starring famous silver screen actor Jackie Cooper and others, will be shipped to Shanghai for public release soon. Many famous songs in the film are novel and pleasant to listen to. They are now being finely printed and published by the Yaguang Art Company, with attached simple scores. Ladies who love songs can purchase them directly from the music departments of the four major companies and various music stores.</p>

<p>— Written by Dongyun, Illustrated by Xiuyan</p>
<p>Southern Opera is popular in the Changshu-Wuxi area. The themes of the plays are mostly folk stories involving the love of children (such as Liang Shanbo, He Wenxiu, etc.). It doesn't seem to be "elegant," but it can't be as popular and easy to understand as "Yue Opera" and "Shen Opera." This may be the reason why "Southern Opera" cannot become popular.</p>
