<p>社評</p>
<h3>瞭望所謂『新秩序』的前途</h3>
<p>德義日三國對於創建所謂「新秩序」，正在不顧一切的邁進之中；而不甘屈從新秩序的自由國家，亦已消失了與三國妥協並存的希望；這是近頃顯見的形勢。雖然，大局究將如何趨歸？新秩序的實現究有幾許可能？請爲試作展望。</p>
<p>不用說，三國要想實現其迷夢，必先克服反對所謂「新秩序」的各種勢力。這在歐洲。最主要的反對勢力爲保全自己帝國利益而進行鬥爭中的英國；這在亞洲，是爭取獨立生存而正在從事於民族鬥爭的中國。過去的短短時期之中，德義在歐洲。日本在亞洲，所用巧取豪奪的術數，或用虛聲恫嚇，或則鼓煽對方的內變，或逼不得已而突集優勢暴力，閃電取勝；但是這些手段對中英兩國皆告失敗。事實擺在三國面前的，卻是長期全面大戰。三國速戰速決的基本戰略既碰了壁，膠着中的戰略又見其一籌莫展。而中國則內發潛力，外獲多助；英國則廣大的領屬共矢忠誠。兄弟之邦的美國復以全力爲之後盾。總之，德義日的力量在漸消之中，中英的力量在漸長之中，長此一消一長，終局勝敗之數可謂已經註定，所未確定的。祇是時間問題。這是所謂新秩序所無法突破的難關，亦即是迷夢的終點。也許這些說得太遠了。即以較近者而論：德義已在歐洲由武力與外交控制了許多國家，不但控制非即所謂征服。而所控制者亦非即所謂新秩序的領域；况若希臘抗戰，當頭一棒，便成奇蹟；又若羅致匈牙利，斯拉伐克，羅馬尼亞諸邦國，一帆風順，列若小星，不料保加利亞却不屈不撓，謝絕誘惑。日本已在越南取得據點，南進有了憑藉。，然而小但英國不甘示弱而設遠東軍區，荷屬東印度不接受經濟桎梏，即在越南，亦見其荆棘叢生，鯨吞難期。故不問德義在歐洲，或日本在東亞，若想比現在更進一步，實屬隨時隨地皆將遭逢反對的勢力，亦隨時隨地皆有爆發新戰爭的可能；總之。「新秩序」前途難關重重，不但中英兩國而已。原來所謂新秩序也者，對蘇聯，對美國，在所不敢碰磕之列，而蘇美兩國却並小因此而安心旁觀；美國態度堅決而鮮明，對所謂新秩序早有近乎勢不兩立的表示，是小待多說：至於蘇聯，似乎很客氣的竭力避免與所謂新秩序相磨擦，相對立。然而在昨天所傳保加利亞不受德義誘惑的消息之中，蓋有强有力者爲保國撑腰，背後有人。呼之欲出，這不是蘇聯却還有誰呢？大勢若此，難道還不夠論斷於新秩序的終於幻滅，德義日的終於失敗！</p>
<p>上述種種，所指皆是所謂新秩序的四周環境。茲請再就妄想建立「新秩序」者的內在條件：德義兩國人口綜共號稱一萬一」千萬，日本併朝鮮台灣在內。約共八千萬：三國合佔人羣約八分之一，雖不謂甚少，然同惡相濟而非三位一體；比之統一的中國，固不如；比之複雜的英國。亦不如。且事理昭吿我們，建立龐大國家的時代，早就過去了：蓋現代歷史的發展，人類各族的文化程度距離漸次接近。民族自由與獨立的要求成爲不可抗的趨歸：故任何英雄好漢即使羨慕中英兩國而想建立同樣龐大的國家，已經完全不可能了。今德義與日本，不量自力而一則想平分歐洲及其海外殖民地，一則想征服全亞洲，各目控制若干萬萬的人類，說他們等於痴人說夢，並不謂過。再從資源上看，德義日三國的天賦，又皆絕對不夠經營龐大的國家的根基；而三國所取的方式依然是歷來帝國主義的老例。指望由剝削被征服的國族而自肥：這從人類根性來說　拂逆了各族天賦的民族意識；這從國際運動來說，其智慧小如社會主義；根本是逆天行事，徒見其緣木求魚。所以，在德義已征服的歐洲各國內、到處是怠工與騷動，在日本的中國軍事佔領區裏，則到處是破壞荒廢。用了猙獰的面貌，企求効命的眞誠：定了主奴的關係，企求兄弟朋友的利益、這是與帝國主義共存亡的矛盾，決非溫情懷柔所得濟其窮。而所謂新秩序儘向這矛盾走。此其前途，祗是渺茫的夢境，祗是沒落的墓道！所以，縱使撇開主義的成見、三國雖要模仿蘇聯的兼併波羅的海諸小國，亦是在所不可能。若要效顰美國的門羅主義，亦出發點不同而謬以千里了。</p>

<h3>歐戰叢談廿四　倫敦人的地下生活</h3>
<p>德國空軍集中全力，轟炸倫敦，差不多已成日常功課。倫敦所遭受的生命財產損失，誠不可以數字計。最感痛苦的就是尙未撤退的數百萬居民，每晚警報之聲不絕於耳，出入防空壕如穿梭一般。日常生活之顚倒痛苦眞是無詢可以形容。他們甚至於無可如何之中，發明了一種新奇的口號，叫做　欲避戰爭，惟有從軍。」這是一語雙關的幽默話，雖不無解嘲之意，但在實際上。倒也未始不是大衆在痛苦之下的一個痛快的出路哩！</p>
<p>倫教原爲天下第一大都會，在承平時代，人口多至八百五十萬。目下除了已經奉命撤退的婦孺，及散居四鄉的富翁大戶，約共二白數十萬人之外，多數無法遷徙的平民階級及必須在都市間謀生的男男女女，還及全人口的八分之五。這些人爲維護他們的生命起見，唯一出路便是往「地下鑽！」據最可靠的統計，每晚逢德機襲擊時，往防空當局築造的避彈室，地下火車站及各公共建築物的地室等處躱避者，爲數約在一百萬人左右。至於藏在私人自造的小型防空室，以及半公共建築物等的地室，或防空壕中者，爲數更多，至少當在四百萬人上下。爲了大家預防「人地無門起見，凡是有縫可鑽之處，無不視之爲安身立命之所。從前大家都歡喜住高樓大厦：六層七層的樓房公寓，差不多常常客滿，租金昂貴非常，輕易不容易找到空房間。自德機不時光臨以來，這種情形就大大的轉變了。所有披屋樓房，甚至有電梯的大厦，卽使祇叫人家化一角錢的租金，也沒有人顧問。目下最値錢，最珍貴的去　，倒是大家從前不屑去的地窖。深藏地下的煤礦，以及大工廠中地下消毒過的陰溝之類，如果開放，這些主人們便可立刻致富，因爲這種塲所眞是大家求之不得的好去處呢。</p>
<p>不過倫敦人的地下生活，還須視其階級貧富而異。有錢的人當然到處可以苦中作樂，飲宴微逐，猶無虛日，至於大多數的平民以及靠做工度日的苦工，苦樂懸殊，自不可同日而語了。最上等最舒適的地下生活，要算大旅館中的地曆，建築在地平之下，上面有七層鋼骨水泥的大厦挺着，卓然有不可侵凌之勢。九月十月倫敦受德機轟炸最劇烈之時，大旅館的地下室中，還是音樂悠揚，燈紅酒綠。在小小的廳堂中，穿着軍裝的男人和女太太們依偎相抱，婆娑起舞。在一蔚藍的多惱河」，及「風流寡婦」等華爾滋舞曲之下，大家頗有欲醉欲仙之感。地面上空儘管有戈林上將的轟炸機及本國的高射砲聲對吼着，這班男女一些無動於中，因爲他們覺得在這種大建築物的地下室中，眞是千妥萬妥的安身所在呀！</p>
<p>舞廳之中安放着許多桌子，圍而坐者多是各國的駐英外交官員，英國政府的官吏，軍官，以及粉白黛綠者流。他們吃的都是盛餽，什麼龍蝦呀，雞呀，威斯忌酒呀，和在戰前運到的各色法蘭西酒和丹麥麥酒等。他們所付代價很貴，因爲除了第一流的大旅館尙能供應這些奢侈品外，其他的夜生活遊宴之所，大多數已有望洋莫及之嘆了。</p>
<p>音樂一停，各隻桌于上又大家開始談話了。所談的無非把德機轟炸倫敦，作爲討論的中心。男的女的，都拿他們的專鬥，解提出來。譬如描寫當時外面的情景如何如何，最後的一聲巨響弄得舞廳地板都震動着，是否卽爲附近遭襲，炸彈爆發或係離他們所在不遠的公家機關屋頂上所放的高射砲所致，凡此各種問題，大家都不斷的討論着。</p>
<p>夜闌酒酣，音樂師收拾起了樂譜，臂下搿了大小樂器，一個個的溜出去了。客人們也絡續的散去。有些客人身上早就穿好了長長的睡衣，或猩紅色厚絨布外套，一到地下宿舍，倒頭便睡。單身漢和婦女們多分處而居，甚至還有一個宿舍，專供成婚夫婦居住。這些宿舍雖深處地下，裏面都有空氣調節設備，客人們並可知照侍役，在指定時間，來叫醒他們。雖然及不到在家裏的那樣隨便自］，然而比較起來，這些宿舍總算還很舒適。而最關重要的，在地下不但十分安全，且又聲息稍稀，要是住在地面上任何一層房子裏，受到轟炸的危險，固不必說，就是那些爆炸，焚燒，彈片飛掠的種種聲息，也叫人終宵擾攘，靴以入睡呢。</p>
<p>然而倫敦够得上資格住大旅館的人，究竟爲數不多。而且這種上等地下室早就有人滿之患了。所以最普遍的現象，一遇到空襲警報大作之時，大家還不是拚命的朝那些普通階級的地下室中跑，這種普通人所利用的防空所在，以地下車站爲最，其次則爲靠碼頭築造的鋼骨水泥大倉庫。至於公家及私人所造的防空室，一則人家不敷應用，再則非平民階級者都能仿造，當然求過於供了。（未完）</p>

<p>證券暗盤、作市謠言利空、行市已在高峯、浮多突起出籠、市價驟起跌風、上午跌風甚厲、下午稍稍立定、大漲小回、此爲公債走勢應有之程序、無足重輕、謠言尤不足信、市上祇零星小戶賣出、大戶絕無出籠、市上仍有現貨不敷之象、前途或將暫時盤旋、昨日上午開盤、價祗小二角、因外滙驟緊、金子驟高而起、聯和生大萬春首先賣出、丙種驟打破六十四元、鼎康潤德益昌亦隨之賣出、恒孚先有賣出、後又買回、怡泰鴻大潤利五源樂茂均有買進、午收猛跌數角至一元餘、午後信孚又有買進、仁昌補進亦不少、怡泰繼續買進、聯和長康及順昌亦有需要丙種曾達叫元、後以聯益協康同康　泰德昌等賣出而續趨鬆、惟比上午已略坚、結果－致回小五角半至八角半、成交總數、共計三百餘萬元、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>股票交易成交華成烟草公司股四→股、價爲四十六元五角、</p>
<p>衆業公所股市極其閒散、價格較前幾無變更、實業股與橡皮股成交俱稀、收盤時人心略有向下之勢、</p>
<p>倫敦二十五日（周一）電、今日中國外債及遠東英商各公司股票掛牌行市、華債一致好轉、漲起一鎊至四鎊不等，外債前檔善後借款（英發）獨漲四鎊、價爲二十三鎊、英德續借款、英發）漲三鎊、價爲三十五鎊、克利斯浦漲二鎊、價爲十五鎊、後續鐵路債券、道清及隴海各升二鎊、道清爲十二鎊、隴海爲十鎊、其餘各升一鎊、北寗爲四十五錢，京滬及湖廣非德發均爲十二鎊、湖廣德發仍站十鎊、廣九及津浦原續發、均爲九鎊、至英商股票、微有上落、麥加利銀行股跌落二先令六便士、價七鎊二先令六便士、開平煤礦不記名股漲二先令三便士、價爲十六先令三便士、其餘不動</p>

<h3>糧食　洋米仍到一萬二餘包　不能阻縱者以不操縱</h3>
<p>洋米昨市因投機囤戶活躍、愈甚、謠言層出不窮、有謂香港報價上漲、於是買方氣熖益高、行情則繼漲增昂、西貫一二號米因越南問題、更足爲搶風趁鬧之興奮劑、小紋米向與二號西貢同等價格者、今以緬港交通便利、來源絡繹、未能爲造謠利用、且叉提不起一般盲從囤戶之興趣、彼皮球交易當然不再垂青、因此同一現貨而二號與小紋竟有二三元出入、期貨路貨均有二元之差、昨西貢一二號央華司騰漲元外、而小紋大華司盤盤而已、售開十二月份小紋八十元零四五角、下午一度小至八十元零二角、昨晚收仍爲八十元零四五角、與前晚相此、而一號西貢現則自八十七元至八十八元半、二號現八十四元半、十一月八十三元半及八十二元半、十二月八十二元六七角、均比前日較大元外、進出兩旺成交有一千二三百噸現貨除有本客實消外、又爲囤戶垂青、價漲一元左右、成交亦逾萬包、</p>
<p>洋米接連到滬、昨日又有太古公司涼州輪、由香港裝來四千八百九十四包、昨日上午抵埠、停靠法租界外灘本行碼頭起卸、怡和洋行裕生輪、昨日傍晚五時到埠、停靠雜斯福碼頭、計自香港運來一萬六千二百七十五包、今晨開始起卸、（祖）</p>
<p>新粳尖及藥種等、共到千餘石、銷場方面、一般本街作客見洋米轉緊、一致望好、　胃亦濃、所以貨主扳喊殊力、結果售價並升元砠、聞原包新粳九十三元、次至九十元零五角、眞特九十三元八角、斛見八十九元、八十六元二角、青角茶種八十一元八角至八十元零五角、飛來鳳八十二元半杜洋尖均乏貨無市、</p>
<p>糯米去路未堪稱爽、故如國糯不過平平、仍開八十五元半、惟香港糯因報價見漲、亦稍帶起開特別七十七八元、中關七十五元、</p>
<h3>第三批洋粉　訂價合十八元二五</h3>
<p>麵粉　粉市已入穩定狀態、查二號粉廠盤經前日正式加價一元後、一時未必史動、而各種回籠貨漲風亦漸吿息、如老車棧單昂至二十元高價後、欲漲已屬難能、洋粉市價、曾一度隨廠盤喊高、昨亦站定於十九元五六角、至十九元之間、蓋因本街方面又新訂第三批期洋粉十二月份交貨二萬餘包、合價十八元二角半、故現粉緊張之局勢、已漸消釋、統市兩廠批出共計八千包左右、價仍爲十八元、客盤十九元、各廠以生產不敷、供給數量、殊屬有限、</p>
<p>小麥　日昨小麥市况不脫堅靜之局、自行盤開至二十八元後、華廠方面、亦擬以此價收吸、何如到貨稀寥、且均指定解交日廠限制作價、聞附近崑山太倉麥送交三鑫廠二百餘包、尙未正式做價、市塲交易依然沉寂而乏新成交云、</p>
<p>汪子章君鑒請卽來館一談、</p>
<h3>油餅　黃豆銷細　油價反升</h3>
<p>昨日油市意態不鬆、因操縱者藉空氣作用、利多流言濃厚、致以買氣見盛、行情高砌兀外、不若黃豆銷細、依然長埋疲境、統計做開大有廠豆油一百五十担、價爲八十元至八十一元、烟岐豆油八十件、價爲七十四元五角、膠州豆油一百件、價爲七十二元五角、膠州生油四百五十件、價爲七十四元二角半至七十五兀五角、烟臺牛油七百聽、價爲一百零六元五角、青島生油一百四十桶、價爲一百零三元五角至零四元、以上去路、爲本街香港台灣等、期貨成交青島生油十二月下交一千五六百桶、價爲一百零三元七角半至一百零五元、收盤價爲零四元七角半云、</p>
<h3>紗花　業外操縱之下　紗市從此不穩</h3>
<p>上日回升之紗市、昨則又使疲弱、而入迴旋之途此因實際交易、較前爲减、但三二支單紗、香港帮需求繼續不懈、所以售價獨堅、二十支紗銷路較遜一些、於是投機獲利之戶、又復吐出、市盤乃回挫矣、就目前狀况、仍在盤旋中、照棉紗本身上着想可安定、惟一般業外者、時進時出、以致情况上下不定矣、</p>
<p>雙馬晨開趨勢　挺、因上日在高檔收盤、多頭與緻濃密、首盤二十支雙馬價爲一千二百二十五元、漲五兀、在一千二百二十元外、往返三四次之多、旋因外匯微縮〇三一二五、多頭故意高聲叫喊、一時買勢稍熾、頃刻間漲至一千二百三十二元、但高價一見、獲利者鑒於現銷不及上日之旺、頗思了結、市盤乃徐徐下降至一千二百十九元、此時多頭仍來掙扎、迨全十一時半以上、投機望風不佳、紛紛拋賣、續跌至一千二百十元、收盤價爲一千二百十叫元、查牛日間成交統計六千一百五十元、行情二十支　馬跌七元、茲將各帮口買去之額量、分列如左、</p>
<p>香港五一五同行五、六五〇統計六、二〇〇</p>
<h3>棉花依然沉寂</h3>
<p>現棉情况、無大興趣、大勢尙屬穩定、至於廠方申新永安兩廠、辦胃平平、新裕鴻章等廠因紗市低廉、比雙馬售價要相差將近一百元、對於原料進意更淡泊也、所以棉市益呈徬徨、旣不能升、又不能降也</p>
<p>外棉市價、紐約棉市、晨初先因同業之購買、續後則因現貨商之賣出、及一部份之多頭了結、結果收盤價格、較之上日降落五六磅音、印度昨日又降落二羅比餘、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、日來始終靜寂異常　廠方暫時毫無購意、同業交易濟淡、亦未聞有成交也、</p>
<p>印棉大批到　、前日大英公司蘇曼里（Sinmali）號輪山孟買運來棉花七千一百三十件、二十四日晨抵埠、停靠浦東其昌棧起卸、（祖）</p>
<h3>疋頭　布增「出廠稅」　下月實行說</h3>
<p>廠布　市始昂繼疲、蓋以布盤新漲、脚地未堅、而增加出廠統稅、聞下月一日起勢必實現、兼以月底墊款關係、故市盤稍堅、賣戶驟增、市盤一度上漲、瞬卽回落、結果平平、粗細布·漂染布·坯布等微有－二角參差、廠盤仍堅、怡和廠金三塔漂布開出五十餘箱、價每疋四十一元、本街門市小批　最旺、各批發號購辦坯布·漂染布·絨布·粗布等六百餘件、粵港帮辦綸昌怡和等廠花布·漂染布·光中鴻章等廠府綢、及粗細布·斜紋三百餘件、浙閩帮辦色布·漂布·卡其等一百餘件、</p>
<p>東布先　後跌、售盤疲軟、龍頭細布晨開三十五元五六角、市塲散戶賣氣又盛、故不旋踵直瀉至三十四元九角、後市初開亦疲、嗣以同業抵補、而升至三十五元二角半收盤、四君子嗶嘰一元零八分、</p>
<h3>糖市　赤白糖回振</h3>
<p>昨糖市以外滙轉緊、稍見回振、公會劃盤、現貨二四粗白本棧七十二兀九角、升三角、外棧貨微鬆、現貨七十一元八角、本月三十日打棧單七十一元九角、荷棉白升度近元、BS嘜本棧貨七十一元、荷赤現貨升七角、爲五十元九角、太古車白B嘜西棧七十五元二角至七十五元、後爲七十四兀九角、升五六角、東棧七十四元六角、DY嘜西棧六十八元半、東棧六十八元二角、HX嘜西棧六十八元三角、東棧六十八元、升二三角、二十六日有糖一百包目香港來滬、</p>

<h3>關於「已婚女性」</h3>
<p>— 沙新源</p>
<p>關於郵局不僱用女職員的問題，在幾個月以前曾經談論過一時，而且也會據理力爭過。結果是勝利了，但可惜的是不徹底，你看，郵局在這次招考「初級郵務昌」的廣吿上，居然女子也可列入「資格」項下了，可是這「資格」還要有「條件」！——只要你讀一讀「應試資格」一項下：「凡中華民國的公民（已婚女性除外）……均可報名投考」等等，這不能不促起社會各界的注意，這裹尤是婦女界，應該不容忽視了。</p>
<p>在郵局方面講，他們是讓步了，女子「照理」是沒有．「資格」的，現在却居然也名列其間，大可爲女子們慶幸而「受寵若驚」的。但是我們想想，一個高中畢業的女孩子，最早也得十八九歲，而結婚較遲的也不過二十五六，（因生理上的關係，女子結婚過遲是不宜的。）這就等於說，一個女子的「有用」時期爲八年，其他的五六十年都該是「白活」的。這樣——照郵局的折扣，一個女子的「一生」祇可以算是八年，我們不知道這話該從何說起。</p>
<p>因此，緊接着發生的是：女子爲了謀經濟的自立，進而求取男女的平等地位，結果得「犧牲」結婚。—爲了捨不得拋掉郵局這隻「金飯碗」，也就只好忍痛了。這裹在下不能不替我中華民挨慶賀的，是郵局錄用的女子幸虧不多，否則，我們將會沒有子孫而絕種哩！</p>
<p>郵局是「國家的機關」，尙且這樣公然不招「已婚女子」，不要說別的公司洋行商店了。同時，這無疑是說，「女子該回到家庭裹去專製「肉彈」，社會事業不應顧問。」</p>
<p>我們不相信賢明的郵政當局，竟不在優待婦女生理h的特殊要求（產前產後的休假，據統計平均每個婦女一生要不了二年的休息。）來加以設法，而反在剝削國民權利上來「轉念頭」，是不是中國的婦女不能够參加社會活動？是不是說，中國的社會已經飛快地進步得不要女子來做事情了？是小是說，中國巳經有着四萬萬五千萬人口，女子就業結婚不能兩者兼有，否則中國有人滿之患了？這些，我們都找不到適當的解決方法！</p>
<p>我們的女界同胞，這是切身的問題，應該憑着過去的「爭取」精神繼續力爭，以求貫澈，而決不能默爾而息；要知道，這裏不單楚婦女個別的問題而是整個國家，整個民族，甚至整個世界的一個大問題，尤其是處在今日之下的中國抹殺婦女的力量是自取滅亡，盼望各界人士均能一致注意，而郵政當局也能從長考慮！</p>
<p>這裏，尤其是婦女界是不能默爾而息的！</p>
<h3>專撕招貼的一羣</h3>
<p>— 燠鈞</p>
<p>三年來，上海的人們依舊在過着醉生夢死的生活．只求滿足自己的私慾，而不顧大衆的福利，但其間也不乏頭腦淸醒的有識之士，他們並不放棄自已應盡的責任，還是很活躍很有生氣地幹些有益於社會人羣的工作，可是道些人却很少爲社會上所覺察的。</p>
<p>前天，在無意中給我發覺了一件事，是一件値得記載的事。當我走在福煦路和某路的轉角處，約在淸晨六時前，路人還很稀少，路旁發現二三個二十歲左右的靑年，正在動手撕去牆上的招貼，像有組織似的，手裹還拿着小鏟刀和布袋，把撕下來的碎紙放到布袋裏去，我留心他們所撕去的是　　戲院裸女表演的廣吿，因之我開始明白他們H作的意義了，我就誠懇地向他們探問個究竟。</p>
<p>據說：「他們這一羣工作者，雖然並沒正式的組織，但和他們取同樣行動的卻有好幾個，每天總在淸晨或黑夜人跡稀少的時候出來幹這工作，專撕牆十那些不正當的招貼，像拿色情來誘惑靑年的　　戲院或　　劇地裸女表演的廣告；騙人金錢的　　藥房和　　堂的「包治白濁」「奇靈　　丸」等，凡是一切含有毒素足以麻醉思想詐財騙錢貽害人羣的招貼，都在撕毀之例。</p>
<p>霍桑探案</p>
<h3>舞后的歸宿</h3>
<p>— 程小靑著</p>
<p>第十二章　報告和解釋</p>
<p>他說追：「眞正的兇手，竟就是李芝範，我竟完全想不到。我正自詫異，剛才松泉帶回來一把——」</p>
<p>霍桑似沒有聽得他末了的半句，忙着挿嘴說：「金壽兄，你怎麼說不曾想到？你太健忘哩。今天早晨我們在麗蘭家討論的時候，你不曾說過那甲組皮鞋印子是兇手所留的嗎？道見解完全是正確的。」</p>
<p>倪金壽忽現出局促不安的樣子。牠的身子牽動一下，眼光也避到了地板上。他慢呑呑地說：「我老實說，那祇是我的一種猜想，並沒有什麼根據。我以爲這甲印的人也許是外來的兇手，却想不到是李芝範。因爲我實在不曾想釗他會利用了陸健笙的皮鞋，弄出這麼一齣把戲。」</p>
<p>霍桑道：「那是你太着重在槍彈問題的緣故，因此便忽視r這是一件雙重謀殺案子。」</p>
<p>倪金壽自言自話地說：「這件案子的內幕情形，委實太複雜了，我小能不承認我的眼力實在瞧不透。那末，李芝範殺死麗蘭的動機，可是單爲着金錢問題嗎？」</p>
<p>霍桑點點頭說：「金錢是一個主題，還有毀婚的怨恨。據我看來——」他忽伸手到衣袋裹，從一本日記簿裏摸出兩張紙來。他的眼光在這兩張紙上瞧了一瞧，兩粒有光的眼珠轉動了一下，他的意念上彷彿起了一個轉變。他把拿出來的這兩張紙重新摺好了，拿在手裏，並不給倪金壽瞧。他抬頭說道。。「金壽兄，那松泉有過怎樣的報吿？你先說一說，然後再討論李芝範的動機和行動，程序上比較適合些。」</p>
<p>倪金壽點點頭，說：「好，讓松泉目己再說一遍。」他用手指在書桌邊上的電鈴鈕上擦了一下。有一個聽差馬上走進來。他吩咐說。二叫松泉進來。」</p>
<p>霍桑把殘餘的烟尾丟進了灰盆，又把身子在沙發h靠得史舒服些，準備聽松泉的報吿。兩分鐘後，那個體格魁捂的松泉已進來了。這個人我也不認識，但看他的神氣，和報吿時說話的次序，足見他也是一個相當幹練而爲警探界不易多得的人材。（一七八）</p>

<p>在愛多亞路福煦路口有一個鳩形鵠面的乞丐，用手指蘸水寫字，中英對照，字均淸秀，旁並放有一張南京某大學畢業文證一紙。閱後不覺萬感交集，打油一首：</p>

<h3>食無雞</h3>
<p>— 萬歲</p>
<p>肉價已漲到二塊多錢一斤，食無雞目然也算不得寒酸的了。我担憂的是淸客盈門，繡履三千的權貴之流，無魚尙且要高歌長鋏歸來乎，况無雞乎！而道「雞」又是聖誕佳節不可或缺的「火雞」。</p>
<p>「聚誕一是外國節，不在龍舟競渡，人閒天上之例的。然而，是不是爲了「生意人」要多做一點生意，稱之爲「外國冬至」；或者是「外國的月亮比中國的美麗」，不得不穿起禮服來EVE一番，「外國節」在中國也就普天同慶了，火雞自然也斷不可少。－還訊得有人說過，火雞是中國的特產，擴大「外國冬至」，亦所以推廣國貨之道也。</p>
<p>那末，這確是令人遺憾的事，舟山羣島的火雞今年已完全被「統制」了！</p>
<p>不過歐戰方殷，在上海的美僑也在續批撤退中，洋先牛們對於這「自已的佳節」的雅興或許也早被更　大的責仟所打消了，卽使幽默如蕭伯納先生，也小至於　　嘴來一個「吃雞救國」的口號吧？我們似乎更不必、慷他人的慨一告訴孩子們聖誕老人將從烟囱中送糖菓禮物來了！</p>
<p>然而，嚼着靑菜根的我，今年對於一喀火雞之味的奢望反而殷切起來，那是因爲肉價已漲到了二塊多錢一斤；史因爲火雞是我們舟山羣島的特產。</p>

<h3>國樂家獨奏紀</h3>
<p>— 依吟</p>
<p>筆者素仰琵琶專家衛仲樂先生，馳名樂壇，門下桃李甚多，兩年來爲國樂宣傳，在美國博得同聲讚揚，備著辛勞，今年夏天遄返上海休養，膺聘滬江大學敎授古樂，並於本月二十日與二十：日舉行兩次演奏，會塲在博物院路亞洲文會伍連德堂。</p>

<p>筆者私願衛先生於今後，不時的舉行公開演奏會，使國樂生命重放光明，且推動國樂向前孟晋，發揚光大，復興民族文化，獨樹國樂一幟；民衆更得純正的音樂以薰陶撫慰，則幸甚矣。</p>
<h3>石萍加入祿寶</h3>

<p>石萍，這一銀幕上的新人，以前本在求德女中肄業，去年十月閒，「國聯公司招考歌舞班學生，石萍以愛好歌舞與常影，乃毅然報名投考而被錄取了，經過若干時日的訓練，始與國聯正式訂立演戲合同　不久以前，外間盛傳石萍吿假赴內地，又有一時盛傳她與某君訂婚，事實上，赴內地之計小成，與某君訂婚亦屬無稽，現在，消息傳來，她行將加入綠寳劇塲，在舞台h與大衆相見了。原來石萍向「國聯」告假一事，確係事實、乘此假期未滿之前，爲增進本人演技起見，始有此次加入祿寶之舉，聞日期已定於下月初旬。</p>
<p>按綠寳劇塲歷來所演白話劇，極受觀眾歡迎，現在又得影壇新人，負有優秀演技的石萍加人演出，預料將爲綠寳增光不少呢。</p>
<h3>女藝人群像</h3>

<p>（七）顧蘭君</p>
<p>一般人於顧蘭君的與李夾鬧戀愛，以爲將損及她的藝術前途，其實顧蘭君的忠於本位工作的精神，也是不可抹殺的。現在，顧蘭君與李英同居於西摩路的華業大樓，顧蘭君對於此事曾公開承認過，不必爲她諱言。華業大樓是公寓房子，蘭君租了兩個房間，其中一間是套房，當蘭君明天要拍戲或演戲的時候，先一晚她就住到套房裹去了！關着門靜靜地熟讀劇本，誰也不許打攪她，就是李英也不能例外；這說明了她雖然需要戀愛，但是她並沒有懈怠她的本位工作，她仍是隨時爲着自己的前途努力着的。</p>
<p>蘭君在明星影片公司時代，已有着優越的地位，「桃李爭豔」是奠定她基礎的作品，戰後加入新華，以主演「貂蟬」一片而取獲了影壇上更崇高的地位，之後就是她的黃金時代。她之與李英發生戀愛是在合演「黃天霜」武俠片的時候，而最近完成的「薄命花」則是她與李英結合以後的首次結晶品了</p>
<p>「薄命花」的原名是「金錢與愛情」，內容差不多就是蘭君爲自已寫照，蘭君過去曾爲以六千元易取她的幅照片的一大山人顧乾麟所嬖愛，蘭君跟一山人的感情本來不壞，但是她看了「木偶奇遇記」卡通片以後，思想上受了很大的影響，她決意擺脫金錢的覊絆，這樣纔另外開闢了一條戀愛路綫，與李英結合了。「薄命花」的劇情就是寫她戀愛路綫轉變的經過，不過劇中的女主角不是電影女明星而是一個舞女罷了。</p>
<p>「薄命花」的劇情旣是在這一個主旨之下產生，所以它對於金錢玩弄女性的罪惡是有着充分暴露的。此片的監製人是張松濤，蘭君是他的義女，而李英則與他有着師生的關係，所以現布蘭君叫李英「大阿哥」，李英叫蘭君「大妹妹」，這特殊的稱謂就是因爲同門的關係而來的。</p>
<p>蘭君對於話劇，也有着相當的興趣，過去曾與唐若靑徐莘園等在卡爾登戲院演過「羣鶯亂飛」，最近則曾參加新藝劇社的陣綫，在「海國英雄」中演鄭成功之妻。她聰明，她知道把握人物個性與戲劇空氣，所以無論在銀幕上舞台上，她的演技都是熟練而成功的。</p>

<h3>Sudden Shift in Foreign Policy: Bulgaria Decides Not to Join the Axis; Soviet Union Uses Its Influence to Prevent German Expansion; Balkan War Zone May Not Expand</h3>
<p>Berlin: A German spokesperson stated to foreign reporters yesterday afternoon that with Hungary, Romania, and Slovakia joining the Axis Pact, the second phase of joining the pact has concluded. Regarding foreign newspaper reports that Bulgaria will also join the Tripartite Pact, nothing has been heard here. (Haitong Telegraph, 26th)</p>
<p>Sofia: The Bulgarian ambassador to Germany, Mr. Taraganov, returned from Berlin yesterday. It is widely believed that he will submit a report to the government today. It is also known that the Secretary-General of the Soviet Foreign Ministry, Mr. Sobolev, arrived here by special plane on Sunday and was personally received by King Boris. It is widely believed that the reason Germany failed to instigate Bulgaria to join the Tripartite Pact was due to Soviet opposition. (United Press, 26th)</p>
<p>Sofia: After the Bulgarian government suddenly stopped participating in the Axis and decided not to send politicians to Berlin, King Boris immediately consulted with Soviet Foreign Secretary Sobolev and Soviet Ambassador Lavristev yesterday. This consultation is considered extremely important. The sudden development of Bulgarian foreign policy is considered a sensational move here. Previously, it was expected that Bulgaria would follow in the footsteps of Romania and Slovakia, signing a similar treaty of alliance with the Axis powers. Diplomatic circles had predicted that after the signing of this new alliance treaty, Germany and Bulgaria would soon jointly deal with Turkey. It has been learned that Bulgaria was ready to send politicians to Berlin to resolve some important details in the German-Bulgarian agreement, and possibly sign the agreement in Berlin. In the past, it was believed that Bulgaria would adopt a foreign policy coordinated with the wishes of the German government. Bulgaria had wanted to seize territory from Greece, and if German and Bulgarian forces assisted Italy, this request could be fulfilled. Diplomatic circles here generally believed that Bulgaria had already fallen into the embrace of the Axis powers, which was one of the reasons. As Bulgaria's joining the Triple Alliance seemed imminent, martial law was declared in various regions of Turkey, and Turkish troops rushed to the Bulgarian border. Turkey has been determined that if Bulgaria invades Greece, Turkey will help Greece in the war. It is believed that Istanbul will act with its so-called determination. Yesterday's situation took an unexpected and decisive turn. Although Bulgarian politicians were ready to depart for Berlin, a last-minute announcement revealed that Bulgaria's will had suddenly changed. The Bulgarian government decided to keep the delegation in the country and turn to the Soviet Union to negotiate with Soviet trade and diplomatic representatives. According to diplomatic circles here, King Boris said to Hitler during their conversation that Bulgaria had "important reasons" to maintain its non-belligerent status, preferring to postpone its demands on Greece rather than risk war at this time. It is also said that the Soviet Union may have warned Bulgaria not to wage war against Greece, as Bulgaria's war against Greece would also involve Turkey, and the Axis powers might win as a result. As a result, Germany's power would extend to Tatarstan and other regions, which is a matter of extreme concern to the Soviet Union. As Hitler's troops approached the Soviet Union, Stalin remained on the sidelines. After Romania and Slovakia joined the Axis, Stalin decided to oppose the further expansion of Germany's diplomatic and military potential. Diplomatic circles here also strongly stated that the signing of the historic German-Soviet alliance was a means by which Germany and the Soviet Union each sought to achieve their own goals. Although the Soviet Union outwardly approved of Germany's recent actions in diplomacy, the mistrust between the two countries remained. The Soviet Foreign Trade Commissioner Sobolev, who consulted with King Boris, is the chairman of the Soviet delegation to the Danube International Conference. The conference discussed the redistribution of the commercial interests in the commercially important Danube region. Mr. Sobolev's presence in Romania was for attending the conference. (International News Agency, 26th)</p>
<h3>Reorganization of Turkish Foreign Ministry</h3>
<p>Istanbul: Reliable sources here report that the organization of the Turkish Foreign Ministry will undergo changes. In the current international situation, which is changing rapidly, it is useless for foreign ministry personnel not to devote their full efforts to paying attention to current international affairs and studying international politics. In the future, matters handled by the Foreign Ministry involving commercial and legal issues will be transferred to other departments, so as to improve the efficiency of the Foreign Ministry and concentrate the attention of Foreign Ministry personnel. (Haitong News Agency, 26th)</p>
<p>Berlin: A spokesperson for the Nazi Party in the Vaevey area stated yesterday that Slovakia's signing of the Axis has come to an end in the current diplomatic negotiations, but Bulgaria will not sign. When someone asked whether Bulgaria's sudden change in its original plan was the result of Turkey's recent defensive measures in the Les area, the spokesperson replied sharply, "I do not believe that a country preparing to sign an agreement with Germany would abandon its original intention because of the threatened actions of a neighboring country." (United Press, 26th)</p>
<p>Moscow: Immediately after the German newspapers published the statement that Hungary's accession to the Tripartite Axis Alliance had obtained the prior consent of the Soviet Union, the Soviet official news agency denied it. Diplomatic circles here believe that the Soviet Union's denial is tantamount to reiterating its neutrality and non-participation in the Axis. In addition to the TASS news agency's denial of the German newspaper's news, the Soviet Union has not yet reacted to the successive accessions of Slovakia or Hungary to the Axis Alliance. (Reuters, 26th)</p>
<h3>Reportedly Germany Provides Guarantee to Respect Turkish Independence on Condition That Turkey Remains Neutral, Western Border of Turkey Remains Vigilant</h3>
<p>Ankara: Foreign observers here say that the political tension in Turkey last weekend has eased. The original reason was that the German Ambassador Papen and the Turkish Foreign Minister Saracoğlu had talks, and Bulgaria's denial of issuing an ultimatum to Greece and its denial of massing troops on the Greek-Turkish border were also reasons for easing the tension. (Haitong Telegraph, 26th)</p>
<p>Istanbul: It was learned today from reliable sources here that the German Ambassador to Turkey, Mr. Papen, has assured the Turkish government that Germany will remain neutral in any conflict in the Balkans. Yesterday, Mr. Papen and the Turkish Foreign Minister Saracoğlu had an hour-long meeting. Although the content of the meeting was not disclosed, knowledgeable sources stated that Mr. Papen assured the Turkish Foreign Minister that if Turkey remained neutral in the current war, Germany would guarantee Turkey's independence in exchange. (International News Agency, 26th)</p>
<p>Ankara: The German Ambassador to Turkey, Mr. Papen, hosted a banquet yesterday to welcome the Turkish Ambassador to Germany, Mr. Khalid, who is currently in Ankara. Many key figures in the Turkish government were invited to attend, including the Turkish Deputy Foreign Minister, Mr. Menemencioğlu. (Haitong Telegraph, 26th)</p>
<p>Ankara: After the government recently declared martial law in the Turkish and European parts of the country, it also appointed General Ali Okan as the commander of martial law, placing all administrative matters under the jurisdiction of the military authorities. (Havas Telegraph, 26th)</p>
<h3>Romanian and Slovak Prime Ministers Return Home from Germany</h3>
<p>Bucharest: General Antonescu and his entourage returned here last night from Berlin. All Romanian cabinet ministers and diplomatic representatives from Germany, Italy, Japan, and Spain were at the station to welcome them. The leader of the Iron Guard, Mr. Shema, delivered a welcome speech. (Haitong Telegraph, 26th)</p>
<p>Berlin: Yesterday afternoon, Hitler personally received Professor Tuka, the Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of Slovakia, with the German Foreign Minister also present. Professor Tuka and his entourage returned home by special train at 7:00 last night. (Haitong Telegraph, 26th)</p>
<p>Bratislava: When Slovakia joined the Tripartite Pact, Slovak President Dr. Tiso sent a telegram to Hitler, expressing his satisfaction with Slovakia's participation in the creation of the new European order, and expressing his belief that under Mr. Hitler's leadership, Slovakia's future would be bright. (Haitong Telegraph, 26th)</p>
<p>Vienna: Eighty-nine officers of the Slovakian Linka Guard, led by Chief of Staff Kubala, arrived here yesterday. Governor Siraci personally welcomed them and delivered a welcome speech, emphasizing the close relationship between Slovakia and Germany. Slovak officers will visit the army exhibition. (Haitong Telegraph, 26th)</p>
<h3>Bulgarian Capital Scheduled to Hold Air Raid Drill</h3>
<p>Sofia: An air raid drill is scheduled to be held here on December 1. The exercise will be controlled by aircraft, and a total of thousands of people will participate in the exercise. (Haitong Telegraph, 26th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Admiral Nakamura Advocates War Against the United States, Says the Real Goal of American Policy is to Subjugate Japan Without War</h3>
<p>Tokyo: Retired Japanese Admiral Nakamura published an article in the National News yesterday, advocating a quick war with the United States. The gist of the article is that Japan wants to complete its "sacred mission," and the United States is the biggest obstacle to it. Therefore, if Japan does not go to war with the United States, it will be extremely difficult to realize Japan's plan to establish a "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere" and end the "China Incident." The real purpose of the United States is to subjugate Japan without war, and its means are to provide aid to Chongqing and impose economic pressure on Japan. Therefore, although the China Incident is still ongoing, all Japanese people must be united and have a strong determination to attack the United States. (United Press, 26th)</p>
<h3>Japan Holds Economic Conference, Calls It the East Asia Group</h3>
<p>Tokyo: The economic conference to discuss economic cooperation between "China, Japan, Manchuria, and Mongolia" and the establishment of a Far Eastern economic group opened here yesterday. The Japanese representatives were the Minister of Agriculture and Commerce and other representatives. The representative of "Manchukuo" was the Minister of Economy, the representative of Nanjing was the "Minister of Transportation," and Mongolia was the Minister of Finance. About 500 people attended the opening ceremony. Chairman Go said in his speech that the reorganization of Europe will thoroughly reform the European economic system, and Japan is working hand in hand with the major European countries. Since Roosevelt was elected president, the attitude of the United States will inevitably use the situation in the Far East to achieve its own goals. Therefore, Japan must take preventive measures. Japan has now drafted a plan to enable "China, Japan, Manchuria, and Mongolia" to cooperate economically and adapt to the national conditions of each country. (Haitong Telegraph, 26th)</p>
<p>Tokyo: Mr. Hoshino, the President of the Japanese Planning Board, said in a speech to the East Asia Economic Conference last night that Japan has not been greatly affected by the US embargo on scrap iron. Japan had expected this and has therefore tried to increase steel production and does not rely on US scrap iron. Therefore, the consumption of US scrap iron in Japan has been decreasing day by day. Mr. Hoshino stated the great potential for coal and iron production in China, Japan, and Manchuria, and emphasized the importance of complete coordination between the three countries. He then spoke about the Japanese government's ten-year economic program. Yin Tongqi of the North China Political Affairs Commission spoke about the importance of improving water conservancy and planting forests to develop agriculture in North China, and improving mining and transportation in North China. He also advocated the use of a system of exchange to maintain the balance of currency values between Japan and North China. (Reuters, 26th)</p>
<h3>Hasegawa Transferred to Governor-General of Taiwan</h3>
<p>Tokyo: Admiral Kobayashi of the Japanese Navy, the Governor-General of Taiwan, has resigned, and his successor has been decided to be Admiral Hasegawa of the Supreme Military Council. Admiral Kobayashi is now listed in the retired military officer records. The new Governor-General is an active-duty admiral, and his selection is due to the importance of Taiwan as a base for Japan's southward advance. Hasegawa previously served as Vice Minister of the Navy, Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Fleet in China, and Commander-in-Chief of the Yokosuka Naval Station. The formal appointment will be made tomorrow. (Reuters, 26th)</p>
<h3>Chairman of the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee Elected; Walter George Elected</h3>
<p>Washington: Senator Walter George of Georgia was unanimously elected yesterday as the chairman of the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee, which is the most powerful committee in the United States, to fill the vacancy left by the late Senator Pittman. Mr. George was born on January 29, 1878, and was elected to the Senate on November 7, 1922. He was re-elected in November 1926, and then in the same month in 1932 and 1938. His current term expires in 1945. (United Press, 26th)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Looking at the Future of the So-Called "New Order"</h3>
<p>Germany, Italy, and Japan are striving to create the so-called "new order" at all costs; and the free countries that are unwilling to submit to the new order have lost hope of compromise and coexistence with the three countries. This is the evident situation recently. However, how will the overall situation eventually develop? How possible is the realization of the new order? Please try to make a forecast.</p>
<p>Needless to say, if the three countries want to realize their dream, they must first overcome the various forces that oppose the so-called "new order." In Europe, the main opposing force is Britain, which is fighting to protect its own imperial interests. In Asia, it is China, which is striving for independent survival and is engaged in a national struggle. In the short period of time in the past, Germany and Italy in Europe, and Japan in Asia, used tricks of deception and coercion, or used empty threats, or incited internal changes in the other side, or were forced to suddenly concentrate superior violence to win lightning victories; but these methods have all failed against China and Britain. The fact in front of the three countries is a long-term, comprehensive war. The three countries' basic strategy of quick victory has hit a wall, and the deadlocked strategy has seen its helplessness. China has unleashed its internal potential and obtained external assistance. Britain has widespread territories that share loyalty. The brotherly country, the United States, is fully backing it up. In short, the strength of Germany, Italy, and Japan is gradually diminishing, and the strength of China and Britain is gradually increasing. With this long-term ebb and flow, the final outcome of victory and defeat can be said to have been determined, and only the timing is uncertain. This is a difficulty that the so-called new order cannot break through, and it is also the end of the dream. Perhaps these are said too far away. Even in the near term, Germany and Italy have controlled many countries in Europe by military force and diplomacy, not only controlling but also conquering. And what is controlled is not the so-called territory of the new order; moreover, if Greece resists, a head-on blow will become a miracle; and if Hungary, Slovakia, and Romania are recruited, it will be smooth sailing, ranking like small stars. Unexpectedly, Bulgaria is unyielding and declines the temptation. Japan has gained a foothold in Vietnam, and the southward advance has a basis. However, Britain is not willing to show weakness and has established a Far East military region. The Dutch East Indies does not accept economic constraints, and even in Vietnam, it can be seen that thorns are everywhere, and it is difficult to swallow the whale. Therefore, regardless of whether Germany and Italy are in Europe, or Japan is in East Asia, if they want to go further than they are now, they will encounter opposing forces at any time and place, and there is a possibility of a new war breaking out at any time and place; in short, the future of the "new order" is full of difficulties, not only for China and Britain. Originally, the so-called new order was in the category of not daring to touch or collide with the Soviet Union and the United States, but the Soviet Union and the United States were not at ease watching from the sidelines. The attitude of the United States is firm and clear, and it has expressed a near-hostile attitude towards the so-called new order, which is not to be said much. As for the Soviet Union, it seems to be very polite in trying to avoid friction and opposition with the so-called new order. However, in the news that Bulgaria was not tempted by Germany and Italy yesterday, there is a powerful person behind Bulgaria, and the person behind it is about to emerge. If this is not the Soviet Union, then who else? If the general trend is like this, is it not enough to conclude that the new order will eventually be shattered and the final failure of Germany, Italy, and Japan will be inevitable!</p>
<p>The above are all references to the surrounding environment of the so-called new order. Now, let us discuss the internal conditions of those who vainly attempt to establish the "new order": Germany and Italy have a combined population of 110 million, and Japan, including Korea and Taiwan, has a total population of about 80 million. The three countries together occupy about one-eighth of the population. Although it is not considered small, they are mutually assisting in evil rather than being a unified entity. Compared with unified China, it is not as good; compared with complex Britain, it is also not as good. And the truth tells us that the era of building large countries is long past. The reason is that the development of modern history has gradually narrowed the cultural distance between the various races of mankind. The requirements of national freedom and independence have become an irresistible trend. Therefore, any hero, even if he envies China and Britain and wants to build a similar large country, is completely impossible. Today, Germany, Italy, and Japan, without measuring their own strength, want to divide Europe and its overseas colonies, and conquer the whole of Asia, respectively, and control tens of millions of human beings. It is no exaggeration to say that they are daydreaming. Looking at it again from the perspective of resources, the natural endowments of Germany, Italy, and Japan are absolutely insufficient to be the foundation for running large countries. And the methods taken by the three countries are still the old examples of imperialism. They hope to enrich themselves by exploiting the conquered countries: from the perspective of human nature, this goes against the national consciousness endowed by each race; from the perspective of international movement, its wisdom is smaller than socialism; it is fundamentally acting against the heavens, and it only sees its futility. Therefore, in the European countries that have been conquered by Germany and Italy, there is sabotage and unrest everywhere, and in the Chinese military occupation zones of Japan, there is destruction and waste everywhere. Using a hideous face, seeking the sincerity of obedience: determining the relationship between master and slave, seeking the interests of brothers and friends, this is the contradiction that coexists and dies with imperialism, and it can never be helped by gentle caresses. And the so-called new order is heading towards this contradiction. Its future is only a vague dream, only a tomb leading to decline! Therefore, even if we put aside the prejudice of doctrine, it is impossible for the three countries to imitate the Soviet Union's annexation of the small Baltic countries. If they want to imitate the Monroe Doctrine of the United States, the starting point is different and the difference is thousands of miles.</p>
<h3>Sea Defense American Merchant Property Under Unwarranted Japanese Oppression Attempt to Confiscate Goods Worth Millions on Pretext American Photography Results in Expulsion by Japanese Sentry</h3>
<p>Hong Kong A prominent American merchant from Sea Defense, upon arriving in Hong Kong, stated that the manager of the North American Enterprise Company in Sea Defense, Mr. Tuofu, recently stated that the American property and goods in Sea Defense, valued at approximately three million US dollars, are in danger due to the oppression of the French authorities by the Japanese. Mr. Tuofu also stated that the photographing of the North American Enterprise Company by the United Press reporter Mr. Zhigebi and the American Vice Consul in Hanoi, Mr. Linton, was entirely within their rights, as the company is American property. The Japanese sentries who expelled them from the North American Enterprise Company's premises were actually infringing upon American property. Mr. Tuofu also accused the Japanese of forcing the French authorities to allow the Japanese to manage the North American Enterprise Company's warehouses. Mr. Tuofu solemnly denied the Japanese claim that the North American Enterprise Company is a disguised name recently used by a Chinese enterprise company and is actually Chinese property. Mr. Tuofu pointed out that the company was legally transferred and registered on August 19th under French jurisdiction, and it takes six months to finalize the registration. Although there are still two months before the registration is finalized, the company's property, including premises subleased from Texaco and Dutch companies, is now threatened by the Japanese. The Japanese are also demanding protection and stationing troops in legal American property. The company's warehouses are approximately 30,000 square yards, storing kerosene, machinery, spare parts, automobile materials, and rubber boats. 90% of the goods belong to the American Far East Trading Company, and the remaining portion belongs to Chinese merchants, the American Red Cross, Hengxin Foreign Firm, Gongli Foreign Firm, American Yongyou Company, William Hende Company, and other American companies. The total value of the goods is approximately three million US dollars. Mr. Tuofu also stated that under Japanese pressure, the French authorities have refused to issue export licenses. It seems that the Japanese are clearly trying to confiscate the goods on the pretext that the company is not American property. Mr. Tuofu also stated that when the company chartered a Xijiang boat and was unable to obtain an export permit, and the American goods on the boat were being unloaded, the French authorities forced him to open the warehouse to store the goods from the boat. Mr. Tuofu stated that his company is directly responsible for the goods stored in the warehouse and on the Xijiang boat. Mr. Tuofu also stated that the French authorities have now allowed him to leave Sea Defense and have issued him a visa for his passport. The current question is whether the French authorities will recognize the legal transfer of property from the Chinese Enterprise Company to the North American Enterprise Company. Regarding the Zhigebi and Linton incident, Mr. Tuofu said that even if they had taken photos, this action was within their rights, as the area under the American flag is American property and can be photographed by Americans. Mr. Tuofu accused the Japanese sentries of expelling Zhigebi and Linton as an infringement upon American property and pointed out that news about American expatriates and American property in Vietnam is currently only allowed to be disseminated by Japanese news agencies, so the reports are biased. (United Press dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>Hong Kong According to Japanese sources in Hanoi today, the Vietnamese authorities are considering taking "measures" against the American Consul and Vice Consul stationed in Hanoi as a result of an American news reporter taking photos at a Japanese military materials depot. The Japanese sources stated that the authorities, at the urging of the Japanese army, have decided to expel United Press reporter Zhagebi. American Vice Consul Linton accompanied Zhagebi last week when he photographed the so-called military materials depot. He and the American Consul Li Te are also subject to "measures" taken by Vietnamese officials.

<p>French Professor Lectures on the Current Situation in Laos</p>
<p>Hanoi Professor Lai Wei of the Department of Ethnology at the French Far East Academy gave a lecture yesterday, explaining in detail the current situation in Laos, western Vietnam. He said that within the region from Thailand to Hainan Island, the Thai ethnic group is actually the largest ethnic group, and the language, clothing, and culture of the Lao people are indeed similar to those of the Thai people. Hundreds of years ago, the Lao people were scattered throughout the Mekong River basin and the upper reaches of the Menam River, and their culture was very prosperous. Although they experienced ups and downs in the middle, they were still able to maintain their inherent characteristics. When French forces extended into Vietnam, the Lao people gradually declined due to internal strife and the harassment of mountain bandits in the north. At this time, the ruler of the Lao people was almost prepared to hand over his only remaining territory, the Luang Prabang County, to his historical enemy, the Siamese people. However, the residents of the county voluntarily sought French protection and surrendered to Mr. Bavi, the French envoy stationed in Bangkok at the time. This is the process by which Laos became attached to France. In the past fifty years, the country has been painstakingly managed by France, and it has not only enjoyed peace for a long time, but also gradually restored the national prestige, and the economic life has also greatly developed. Therefore, whether in terms of land, river economy, or population, today's Laos has established an inseparable connection with Vietnam. In short, the Lao people hold one of the oldest cultures in the world today, and after fifty years of influence, they have become closely related to France in culture. (Havas, 25th)</p>

<h3>Chairman of Sichuan Province Orders Food from Hunan and Shaanxi National Food Bureau in Chongqing Sells Rice at Fixed Price</h3>
<p>Chongqing Since April, the price of rice in Sichuan Province has almost doubled. The new Chairman, Zhang Qun, in order to relieve the plight of the people, plans to order white rice from Hunan and flour from Shaanxi to stabilize the price of rice. The reason for the rise in rice prices in Sichuan Province is that unscrupulous merchants are taking advantage of the army's need for large quantities of food to monopolize and profit. (Havas dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>Chongqing In order to cope with the current rice situation in Chongqing, the National Food Bureau will sell rice to the poor, military families, students, and civil servants at a special price from December 1st. This special price will be 60 yuan per shi, while the market price is 180 yuan. The bureau will supply 1,000 shi per day under a partial rationing system. The poor and military families will be able to purchase from municipal stores with rationing certificates, while students and civil servants will be handled by schools and institutions. Each adult can purchase two dou. (Reuters dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>Chongqing The rice price problem in Chongqing has not eased. According to Shen Zonghan, Deputy Director of the Central Agricultural Experiment Station, at the end of the year before last, there were 50 million shi of rice stored in the 15 provinces in the rear. Last year, 750 million shi were harvested and 700 million shi were consumed, leaving 50 million shi. Combined with the previous year's surplus, there were a total of 100 million shi of rice stored. This year, the harvests in all provinces exceeded last year, and although Sichuan Province was slightly lower, it was still about the same as last year. Therefore, there should be more surplus rice this year, so the rice prices in Yunnan, Guizhou, Hunan, Fujian, and other provinces have all fallen back by one-third to one-half, while Sichuan Province is the opposite. This is definitely not a natural cause, but a man-made one. (Havas dispatch, 26th)</p>

<h3>British Ambassador to the United States Talks at Length with President Roosevelt Although British Gold Reserves in the United States Have Decreased, All Sectors in the United States Still Advocate Intensifying Aid to Britain</h3>
<p>Washington The British Ambassador, Lord Lothian, met with President Roosevelt for 80 minutes. Afterwards, Lord Lothian told reporters that the President and he had not mentioned finance at all. The President wanted to know the recent events in Britain and the situation of their resistance to air raids. He described everything in detail to the President and told him that Britain was very optimistic if it could get some help from the President. The President did not make any promises, and he did not discuss any specific issues with him. (Reuters dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>Washington The British Ambassador, Lord Lothian's remarks that Britain's dollar reserves are gradually decreasing have still aroused continuous attention and discussion in all parts of the United States. However, all comments are not unfriendly to Britain. The Washington Bee Newspaper stated that most Americans know that for the sake of their own interests, they must provide Britain with rapid and continuous material assistance. The suggestion that assistance should be stopped if Britain cannot pay cash is immediately rejected as absurd, because the motive for helping Britain is not money, and every cannon and machine crossing the Atlantic is an investment in America's own security. The Washington News said of Britain's war record that any schoolchild knows that everyone will never see the return of this extra money, so the United States should buy the British territories in the Caribbean Sea and Bermuda.

<p>New Orleans Sir Citrine, Secretary-General of the British Trades Union Congress, spoke to the American Federation of Labor here last night, warning the United States that it must be prepared to prevent German forces from extending into the Western Hemisphere before the United States' existing military preparations are completed. He said that since the Nazi Party has already set the time for an outbreak in Europe, it will also take unexpected actions in the Western Hemisphere in the future. He also said that Britain will continue to fight until dictatorship is eradicated from the world. American workers only need to step up the production of armaments to overcome the Nazi Party without firing a single shot. Finally, he said that Britain still needs more planes. American Federation of Labor President Green responded, saying that the United States must quickly transport the strength needed by Britain to Britain so that Britain can win an early victory.

<p>Washington The British Ambassador to Washington, Lord Lothian, stated yesterday that if Britain wants to win, the United States must accelerate massive aid to Britain. Lord Lothian made his remarks after meeting with President Roosevelt. The Ambassador said that Britain is optimistic about the future of the war, depending on the United States increasing and accelerating its assistance to Britain. Lord Lothian also firmly stated that he did not discuss the issue of Italy paying Britain's credit loans with President Roosevelt. He said that Britain hopes to receive assistance from the United States regarding aircraft, military supplies, ships, and economy next year. (United Press dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>London According to responsible sources, there is no truth to the claim in a New York newspaper that the recently returned Ambassador to the United States, Lord Lothian, carried a memorandum announcing that the British government wanted to buy or lease non-combatant warships from the United States. According to the newspaper's report, the warships mentioned were three battleships, six cruisers, and one hundred destroyers. (Reuters dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>Washington When a Reuters reporter asked British Ambassador to the United States Lothian about the London questions regarding his talks with reporters on Saturday, he replied that the questions were clearly based on a misunderstanding of his remarks. His remarks regarding Britain's financial position in the United States were made in response to a question about what kind of assistance the United States could provide to Britain in 1941. He replied at the time that the United States could provide aircraft, military supplies, ships, and finance. His remarks regarding Britain's financial position were entirely related to the situation created by the US legislation requiring Britain to purchase goods in cash. He did not mention Britain's general economic and financial position. The questions and answers at the time were limited to the status of the dollar, and all parts of the United States interpreted it in this sense. (Reuters dispatch, 26th)</p>

(Note: The Johnson Act stipulates that no further loans will be granted to any country that has not paid back its debts to the United States from the previous European war.) Also, Senate Majority Leader Barkley predicted that the issue of British loans and deposits would not be discussed in this session of Congress. This issue should be discussed only after the opinions of Congress have been clarified. Barkley's speculation was made after visiting President Roosevelt. (United Press dispatch, 26th)</p>

<h3>Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan Announces: Nomura Appointed as Ambassador to the United States, Suma Transferred as Minister to Spain</h3>
<p>Tokyo – The Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced yesterday the appointment of General Nomura as the new Ambassador to the United States. Suma, spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, was concurrently appointed as Minister to Spain. (International News Agency dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>Tokyo – It was announced here yesterday that General Nomura has been appointed as Ambassador to the United States. The new ambassador previously served as Foreign Minister in the Abe Cabinet, as a member of the Supreme Military Council, and as Commander-in-Chief of the Yokosuka Naval Base. (Haitong News Agency dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>Chongqing – Various Chinese circles here believe that the appointment of Naval Admiral Nomura as Japan's new ambassador to the United States is a sign that Japan hopes to reach an understanding with the United States on the overall situation in the Far East. However, well-informed observers believe that Nomura's mission will inevitably encounter failure, because if Japan continues its aggression against China, concludes the Tripartite Pact, and expands into the South China Sea, Nomura will only waste his breath like his predecessors. If Japan cannot abandon its fundamentally hostile Far Eastern policy towards the United States, adjusting US-Japan relations will be extremely difficult. (Reuters dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>Tokyo – The Asahi Shimbun published an editorial today regarding Nomura's appointment as Ambassador to the United States, expressing approval and issuing a warning, stating that while the ambassador's qualifications and achievements are important, they are not enough to guarantee the improvement of US-Japan relations. The state of no treaties between the two countries still exists, and the United States is paying attention to the Berlin Pact's apparent animosity towards the United States and is interfering in various Eastern issues, including the Dutch East Indies, in order to obstruct Japan's East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere plan. All of these are facts that should be noted. Furthermore, the tension in the international situation can also affect US-Japan relations. The cooperation between Britain and the United States in East Asia and the Pacific is currently increasing the risk of friction between Japan and the United States. We must not ignore this either. Our mention of these various difficulties is not intended to discourage the new ambassador, but rather because we believe that these difficulties will make his work more valuable. Anyone who foresees many obstacles ahead can prepare for them in advance. The Asahi Shimbun hopes that Nomura will not only demonstrate his diplomatic talents but also his political talents. Other major newspapers did not publish editorials on Nomura's appointment. The Yomiuri Shimbun, however, published an article, clearly stating Observation Point One: Warning the public not to be optimistic that Nomura's mission to the United States can stabilize US-Japan relations, stating that the United States still maintains the Open Door Policy and Equal Opportunity Doctrine it advocated in 1899, while Japan is pursuing a policy of establishing a New Order in East Asia. Therefore, the conflict of opinions between the two sides is unavoidable. From our point of view, it can be said that if the United States continues to refuse to recognize the New Order in East Asia established by Japan, the disputes in US-Japan relations will be difficult to resolve.

<h3>German Aircraft Groups Bombard London, Bristol Heavily Damaged, Incendiary Bombs Cause 45 Major Fires, British Air Force Night Raids German Naval Base</h3>
<p>Berlin – Large formations of German aircraft launched continuous, batch attacks on the British southwestern port of Bristol from Saturday night to Monday. German bombs rained down, factories and stores collapsed one after another, and the entire city was engulfed in raging fires and black smoke, creating a terrifying scene. (Haitong News Agency dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>Berlin – According to a report from German reconnaissance planes, the British city of Bristol has become a large furnace after being attacked by German aircraft on Sunday, with dense black smoke and at least forty-five major fires, with countless smaller fires. The southern part of the port suffered particularly severe damage, with ten large factories in the industrial area all ablaze. There were five major fires in the northern part of the city.

The incident arose when the Italian fighter escort squadron was severely damaged by British fighters while approaching England, and they fled first, leaving the German bombers to fend for themselves. The German bomber squadron then dispersed and returned to their original defenses. When they negotiated with the Italian pilots, each refused to yield, and they began arguing, eventually drawing their guns and firing at each other, resulting in the deaths of several combatants.

<h3>Greek Troops in Albania Launch Attacks on Multiple Fronts, Break Through Italian Second Line of Defense, Continue to Occupy Four Important Strongholds, Italian Communiqué Claims Counterattack Has Begun</h3>
<p>Athens – After occupying Korçë, Greek troops also took Pogradec in their stride. Yesterday, the Greek troops in Albania repeatedly destroyed many Italian castles. The latest news revealed that Greek troops attacked on five fronts, and with rapid progress, occupied at least four more cities in Albania, broke through the Italian second line of defense, captured more than 8,000 Italian soldiers, and advanced more than 50 miles into Albania. The speed of the Greek pursuit forced both Greek and Italian armies to abandon all weapons except light arms. The Greek army is clearly planning to descend directly on the Shkumbin River, cutting Albania in two, as a prelude to attacking the Albanian capital of Tirana. According to recent news, Greek troops on the northern front, with the help of British forces, have reoccupied Moschopolis and Pëllumbas, and have strengthened the defenses of Pogradec. In the southwest, after the Italian forces withdrew from Argyrokastro for twenty-four hours, the Greek troops immediately occupied the city, advancing another ten miles and reaching a point ten miles from Tepelenë. This is another important position for the Italian army leading to Vlorë. News from Budapest also stated that a major battle had broken out along the entire front. It was also learned that after the Italian forces withdrew from Konispol opposite Corfu, they launched a fierce counterattack to the south, thus hindering the advance of the Greek mechanized units. Greek sources arriving in Budapest stated that this Italian counterattack was "the fiercest since the outbreak of hostilities." The Italian General Staff in Rome also stated that the Italian army is currently carrying out a major counterattack, but denied the Greek claim that 8,000 Italian soldiers were captured. (International News Agency dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>A broadcast stated that "the Italian army within Albania now faces the possibility of being completely surrounded." Athens also claimed that an Italian general had committed suicide due to military setbacks. (Associated Press dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>London – A Reuters aviation correspondent claimed that the Greek threat to Argyrokastro would drive the Italian Air Force out of its last base within Albania. The Italian squadrons stationed there may have already withdrawn. It has been two weeks since the British Air Force first announced attacks on the airfield there. British aircraft recently flew to the area on Thursday, but the bombing target was a "military concentration." Airfields near the battlefield must be abandoned once they are within artillery range. For example, the Italian Air Force abandoned two of its best forward bases near Korçë before the Greek troops occupied it. The loss of the Italian forward bases in Albania will put British aircraft within easy strike distance of Italian reinforcements landing on the Albanian coast and troop embarkation points in southern Italy.

<p>Renowned Albanian Warriors Assist Greece in Vigorously Eradicating Defeated Italian Troops</p>
<p>Athens – As Greek troops continued to advance and occupy new positions today, the fiercest and most renowned fighting people in Albania, the Mërgëtorët, also took up arms and ambushed key areas, helping to kill isolated Italian troops. The fierce Mërgëtorët have never formally submitted to the Italians and have long considered resisting Italian aggression. The Greek advance has provided the Mërgëtorët with the opportunity to snipe at the Italian troops. These people live in the wild villages between the Vjosë and Shkumbin rivers, severely disrupting the Italian rear and inciting Albanian rebellion. This action by the Mërgëtorët has greatly assisted the Greek army in capturing Italian positions. The Italian positions were on the north bank of the turbulent Vjosë River, facing Greek artillery fire in front and attacked by the Mërgëtorët in the rear. How could the Italian army not be defeated? A part of the Greek army that had crossed the Vjosë River and advanced on Pogradec is currently rushing west toward the Italian positions at the foot of the Lënia Mountains. Authoritative sources claim that the Greek army has also captured eight mountain guns, eight tanks, and one hundred transport vehicles left by the Italian army in the valleys around Moschopolis. These eight captured tanks have been used by the Greek army as the vanguard for attacking isolated Italian troops. When these eight tanks entered Medyk, the Italian garrison there mistakenly thought they were their own troops and welcomed them. At that moment, the Greek troops in the tanks fired wildly at the welcoming Italian positions, causing countless casualties. The Moschopolis area is filled with thousands of defeated Italian soldiers, many of whom were already frozen, starving, and dying. They were then attacked by the Greek army. In this battle, several thousand more of these defeated soldiers were captured by the Greek army. According to reliable estimates, the number of Italian soldiers captured by the Greek army so far has reached more than 7,000. Official war reports state that Italian aircraft bombed several inland towns and villages, causing some deaths and injuries, but no military equipment was damaged.

<h3>General de Gaulle Returns to London, Meets with British Prime Minister for Long Talk, French Revival Movement Grows</h3>
<p>London – General de Gaulle has returned to London after spending about three months in French Equatorial Africa, recovering Gabon and reorganizing the army. According to a communiqué issued by the Free French Headquarters, General de Gaulle's return is to study various political and military issues related to the war with the British government. General de Gaulle had his first meeting with British Prime Minister Churchill at 10 Downing Street last night after his return to England. Last night, General de Gaulle gave a broad speech, giving a general review of the situation from the French perspective, stating that now that the British Air Force has destroyed Mussolini's warships and the Italian army fighting the Greek army is fleeing in disarray, the people of France can understand that the French army has been deprived of the glory of participating in the final victory for freedom. But the patriotic enthusiasm of the French people, inspired by French heroes such as Joan of Arc and Clemenceau, is now growing and will help in the final liberation of France.

<p>Greek Forces Eye the Front Lines – The Greek troops in the Epirus region continued to advance north toward Argyrokastro yesterday. After fierce fighting, the Greek troops have occupied the strategic point of Kiagkotsai on the Santa Quaranta road. Their vanguard is advancing very quickly, far from the main army, and there is a risk of their rear being cut off. Argyrokastro is located in a very dangerous deep canyon between two major mountains. The Italian army has blown up the pass at the entrance to the town, which indicates that the Italian army is preparing to defend the town tenaciously. (Associated Press dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>Greece – Yesterday, Italian intelligence claimed that the Italian army launched a continuous and powerful counterattack on the Greek front, especially in the Epirus region. The intelligence stated that Fascist aircraft bombed various points on the Greek front, while Greek and British aircraft bombed Durazzo, an important Italian seaport in Albania, but the damage was minor.

<p>Albanian Front – Four Italian Divisions Annihilated</p>
<p>Athens – Reuters learned today that it is estimated that since the outbreak of the Greek-Italian war, up to four Italian divisions on the Albanian front have been cut off and destroyed, and an Italian armored division that launched the war in two directions has also lost all contact and is temporarily useless. Military experts have confirmed that Greek troops are continuing to advance on all fronts, and several new major military actions are developing. At the same time, military figures issued a cautious tone, saying that the communiqués issued by the Greek command may not record all their achievements, and military actions cannot be said to be completed until the positions are consolidated. The Greek vanguard is currently acting quickly, but the command cannot yet announce that it has occupied certain locations. The Greek cavalry that reached Pogradec yesterday is still near the area, and Greek reinforcements are rushing there, but the retreat of the Italian army has left behind a large amount of materials, which has slightly hindered the march. The continued advance has threatened the various bases that the retreating Italian army originally intended to defend. A large group of Greek troops entered Pogradec (north of Korçë in southwestern Albania) near the South Country border yesterday, and it is heard that Greek cavalry has occupied Moschopolis (ten miles west of Korçë) and continued to advance to the confluence of the Trevla River. It is also said that Greek troops have occupied Konispol in the Kalamas River region. (Reuters dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>Italian Troops Reinforced to the Front, Suffered Fierce Bombing by British Aircraft</p>
<p>London "Exchange Telegraph" Lake Ohrid news said that Italian troops were believed to be preparing for a large-scale counterattack on the northern front. The news said that Italian reinforcements had arrived halfway between Elbasan and Pogradec. These new troops could be seen in the south of the lake in the direction of Tithorea. "Exchange Telegraph" said that according to a quiet report from British headquarters in Athens, a major Italian ammunition depot and motor transport convoy were bombed by the Royal Air Force in the Tepelenë area. The report said, "Three convoys of motor transport and camel teams rushing to reinforce Korçë were bombed by low-flying aircraft and were in complete disarray." (Associated Press dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>Capital of South Country – It seems that Italian troops are launching battles on the entire front in Greece today. According to the observation of neutral parties, although it is too early to grant victory to the Greek army, the Greek army seems to be severely attacking the Italian army on the entire Albanian front. According to news from all sides, whether it is from Sofia to Athens, London, and the fronts of Italy and Greece, all claim Greek victory and Italian failure.

<h3>Random Talks on the European War 24: Londoners' Underground Life</h3>
<p>The German air force concentrates all its efforts to bomb London, which has almost become a daily routine. The loss of life and property suffered by London is indeed incalculable. The most painful thing is for the millions of residents who have not yet been evacuated. The sound of air raid sirens never ceases every night, and going in and out of air raid shelters is like shuttling back and forth. The upheaval and pain of daily life is truly beyond description. They even invented a novel slogan amidst their helplessness, called "If you want to avoid war, you can only join the army." This is a double-edged humorous remark. Although it is not without a self-deprecating meaning, it is actually not necessarily a pleasant way out for the public under suffering!</p>
<p>London was originally the world's largest metropolis. In peacetime, the population reached 8.5 million. Currently, in addition to the women and children who have been ordered to evacuate, and the wealthy and large households scattered in the surrounding countryside, totaling about 2.7 million people, the majority of the common people who cannot migrate and the men and women who must make a living in the city still make up five-eighths of the total population. For the sake of protecting their lives, the only way out for these people is to "dig underground!" According to the most reliable statistics, every night when German planes attack, about one million people hide in air-raid shelters built by the air defense authorities, underground train stations, and basements of various public buildings. As for those who hide in small air-raid shelters built by private individuals, as well as the basements of semi-public buildings, or in air-raid trenches, the number is even greater, at least around four million. In order to prevent everyone from being "homeless," every place with a crack to drill into is regarded as a place to settle down and make a living. In the past, everyone liked to live in high-rise buildings: six-story or seven-story apartment buildings were almost always fully occupied, and the rent was very expensive, making it difficult to find an empty room. Since German planes began to visit from time to time, this situation has changed dramatically. All dilapidated houses, even skyscrapers with elevators, even if they only ask people to pay a dime in rent, no one cares. Currently, the most valuable and precious place is the cellar that everyone used to despise. Deep underground coal mines and disinfected sewers in large factories, if opened, these owners could immediately become rich, because these places are truly good places that everyone seeks but cannot find.</p>
<p>However, the underground life of Londoners still varies according to their class and wealth. The rich, of course, can find pleasure in hardship everywhere, with drinking and banquets almost every day, while the disparity between the happiness and suffering of the vast majority of common people and laborers who live by working cannot be mentioned in the same breath. The most luxurious and comfortable underground life is the basement of large hotels, built below ground level, with seven-story steel-reinforced concrete buildings standing above, standing tall and unassailable. When London was most severely bombed by German planes in September and October, the basement of large hotels still had melodious music and bright lights. In a small hall, men in military uniforms and women in elegant attire snuggled together and danced gracefully. Under waltzes such as "The Blue Danube" and "The Merry Widow," everyone had a feeling of being drunk and wanting to become immortal. Despite the roaring of General Göring's bombers and the country's anti-aircraft guns on the ground above, these men and women were unmoved, because they felt that the basement of this large building was truly a safe place to be!</p>
<p>Many tables were placed in the ballroom, surrounded by diplomatic officials from various countries stationed in England, British government officials, military officers, and women dressed in makeup. They ate lavish meals, such as lobster, chicken, whiskey, and various French wines and Danish malt liquor that were shipped before the war. The price they paid was very expensive, because apart from the first-class large hotels that could still supply these luxury goods, most other nightlife venues and banquet places could only sigh in vain.</p>
<p>When the music stopped, everyone at the tables began to talk again. What they talked about was nothing more than using the German bombing of London as the center of discussion. Both men and women presented their own expertise and interpretations. For example, describing what the scene outside was like at the time, and whether the final loud noise that shook the ballroom floor was caused by a nearby attack, the explosion of a bomb, or the anti-aircraft guns fired from the roof of a public agency not far from where they were, everyone constantly discussed these various issues.</p>
<p>Late at night, after drinking, the musicians packed up their scores, tucked their various instruments under their arms, and slipped out one by one. The guests also left in succession. Some guests had already put on long pajamas or thick scarlet velvet robes, and as soon as they arrived at the underground dormitory, they fell asleep. Single men and women mostly lived separately, and there was even a dormitory specifically for married couples. Although these dormitories were deep underground, they all had air conditioning equipment inside, and guests could inform the attendants to wake them up at a designated time. Although it was not as convenient and free as being at home, these dormitories were still quite comfortable in comparison. And most importantly, it was not only very safe underground, but also relatively quiet. If you lived in any floor of a building on the ground, not to mention the danger of being bombed, even the various sounds of explosions, burning, and flying shrapnel would keep people restless all night, making it impossible to fall asleep.</p>
<p>However, the number of people in London who are qualified to live in large hotels is ultimately small. And these high-end basements have long been overcrowded. Therefore, the most common phenomenon is that when an air raid siren goes off, everyone still desperately runs to those ordinary-class basements. The most common air-raid shelters used by ordinary people are underground stations, followed by steel-reinforced concrete warehouses built near the docks. As for the air-raid shelters built by public and private individuals, on the one hand, they are not enough for people to use, and on the other hand, not all common people can imitate them, so of course the demand exceeds the supply.

<h3>Most American Residents in Shanghai Still Maintain Their Original Businesses; Most American Residents Who Have Not Evacuated Do Not Want to Leave; American School Will Still Open Next Semester</h3>
<p>According to an employee of the American President Lines, American residents in this port who did not make it on the "Washington" special evacuation ship that sailed out last week will probably not be able to leave Shanghai until February next year, unless they have already booked cabins on President Lines ships. Although there are four President Line ships sailing from Shanghai to the United States this year and in January next year, namely the President Cleveland, scheduled to leave Shanghai on December 9, the President Coolidge, scheduled to leave Shanghai on December 31, the President Pierce, scheduled to leave Shanghai on January 6 next year, and the President Taft, scheduled to leave Shanghai on January 20, the cabins on these four ships are all fully booked. Therefore, those who wish to return to the United States in the future will have to wait until February next year to purchase tickets to return to the United States.</p>
<p>Business Owners Do Not Want to Evacuate</p>
<p>There were originally about 4,000 American residents in this port. In addition to those who have evacuated and returned to the United States, there are still more than 2,500 American residents. It is understood that half of them have no intention of evacuating, as most of them are business owners in Shanghai. At the same time, according to the American Consul General in this port, the American authorities' original plan to send a fourth special evacuation ship, the "Manhattan," to the Far East has apparently been abandoned. It is understood that the ship is currently traveling between New York and San Francisco. Before the signing of the Neutrality Law, the "Washington" and "Manhattan" were transporting American residents evacuating from Europe. The news received in this port regarding the rumors of a strike by the crew of the "Washington" in Manila is inconsistent. However, the American President Lines has not heard of this matter.</p>
<p>Two Gunboats Patrol and Return to Shanghai</p>
<p>The U.S. Yangtze River Fleet's river gunboats, the "Luzon" and "Guam," left Shanghai yesterday and sailed to an undisclosed destination for routine patrol exercises. Rear Admiral Glassford, commander of the Yangtze River Fleet, is in command and is scheduled to return to the Yangtze River on Thursday and still berth at the U.S. Navy pontoon. The only U.S. ship remaining in Shanghai is Admiral Hepburn's private yacht, the "Isabel," which is berthed off the French Bund.</p>
<p>American School Continues to Operate</p>
<p>Yesterday, an employee of the Shanghai American School stated that the school will continue to offer classes next semester and will not be suspended due to the war and the evacuation of American residents. However, the number of students will decrease. Two months ago, when this semester started, there were a total of 520 students, which has now decreased to 190. The number of faculty and staff has also decreased from 32 to 25, all due to the evacuation of overseas residents. The number of students will be even smaller. The school has sent letters to the parents of students to inquire whether they will enroll in the next semester. So far, few replies have been received, and it is impossible to determine how many students will continue their studies next semester. It has now been decided that the next semester will start early on December 30 and end on April 17, two months earlier than usual.</p>
<h3>Accidents Greatly Reduced During Safety Campaign Week</h3>
<p>38 Fewer Cases Than the Previous Week Prove Good Results; Public Concession Police Department Holds "Safety First" Campaign Week; Car Accidents and Injuries Greatly Reduced, Proving Good Results; This week has now passed; The Police Department has decided to continue showing the "Safety First" film for a few days for the benefit of Chinese citizens;</p>
<p>Widely Watched</p>
<p>Chinese members of the Police Department and Fire Department were invited to watch this film at the Gordon Road Police Station at 7:15 p.m. the day before yesterday; The Police Department did not expect traffic accidents to be drastically reduced as a result of this campaign; However, the results of the campaign have proven that all preparations were not in vain; During the "Safety First" campaign week, there were a total of 109 car accidents, a reduction of 38 cases compared to 147 cases in the previous week (ending November 17);</p>
<p>46 People Were Injured, Including 2 Deaths, Which Is Also a Decrease Compared to 61 People Injured in the Previous Week, Including 6 Deaths; As for the results of the "Safety First" campaign week in the French Concession, it is not yet known; It is generally believed that traffic accidents in the French Concession will also be reduced; It is noted that at the beginning of the "Safety First" week, the authorities stated that they would not regret the effort of holding the campaign if traffic accidents could be slightly reduced; However, the situation on the first day of the campaign has proven</p>
<p>It Will Be Successful</p>
<p>Chinese students assisted the police in distributing traffic safety leaflets to pedestrians, all cinemas screened the "Safety First" film, and Peck, Deputy Police Commissioner of the Traffic Section of the Police Department, and others gave speeches on Chinese and foreign radio stations, all of which made no small contribution; The officials in charge of this campaign expressed their gratitude to all relevant parties for the reduction of car accidents by 0.58%, and hope that the number of accidents during "Safety First" week will be further reduced in the future;</p>
<h3>Military Transport on the Burma Road is Smooth and Plentiful; Completing a Major Mission; Half of the Vehicles Dispatched are Dedicated to Cargo Transportation; Shanghai-Kunming Intermodal Transport is Smooth and Has Exceeded the Quota</h3>
<p>The Burma Road, China's only international highway, has been reopened by the United Kingdom on October 18, and it has been five weeks since then. Since the opening of the road, all war materials have been transported into the interior of the country like a rushing tide. These military supplies are transported to various parts of the southwest via Kunming on this road, which is enough to strengthen China's power, and Chinese products are also transported by trucks along this road to overseas countries and handed over to their friendly countries;</p>
<p>Active Driving</p>
<p>This powerful activity undoubtedly proves the consistent national policy of the National Government. Although the Burma Road was closed for three months, the impact on China was minimal. During the first week of the road's opening, the Japanese sent bombers to bomb the road and bridges, among which the most important Mae Khong River Bridge and the road surface were slightly damaged, but this action did not stop the transportation of goods, and the freight trucks did not stop their mission as a result. The Chinese road builders have quickly repaired it, and although the road from Lashio to Kunming is 800 kilometers long, there are Chinese road builders along the section who can repair it immediately if there is any damage, just like the Japanese bombing of the Canton-Kowloon Railway at the beginning of the war. The Chinese authorities repair it as soon as it is bombed;</p>
<p>Smooth Cargo Transportation</p>
<p>According to recent reports, cargo transportation on the Burma Road is now proceeding smoothly under absolutely smooth circumstances, without any obstruction. Two weeks ago, an Associated Press reporter traveled along the road from Lashio to Kunming. According to the reporter, this accidental bombing, as far as he knew during his trip, did not damage anything of the Chinese side. Shanghai received a report from the Associated Press reporter from Lashio last Sunday, stating that a Chinese authoritative spokesperson said that the Burma Road will have more calm and expansion in November, and that the food and goods transported to Chongqing are rarely hit by Japanese aircraft, probably because the Japanese believe that bombing is futile. According to the report, the recent activities of Japanese aircraft have been greatly reduced;</p>
<p>Direct Transportation of Shanghai Goods</p>
<p>According to news from the shipping industry in this port, since the opening of the Burma Road on October 18, the government has restricted cargo transportation and gradually rushed to transport the car fires and military supplies stored in Lashio day and night. It has been completed by the beginning of this month, so cargo transportation has been relaxed recently. The current situation is that half of the transportation is military supplies and the other half is cargo transportation. The government still provides 400 trucks for commercial transportation. In addition, light items and parcels are generally transported by livestock vehicles. The British shipping company Simalo, which chartered the shipping company Qiaocheng in this port, went directly to Rangoon. The ship is currently berthed at the Qichang Wharf in Pudong. Yesterday, it completed the loading of the goods entrusted by Qiaocheng, completed the customs clearance today, and will set sail directly for Rangoon tomorrow morning. Qiaocheng Shipping Company began to handle direct intermodal transportation between Shanghai and Kunming. The announcement was only half a sentence, and the merchants in this port who went to contact it were extremely crowded. As of yesterday, it has exceeded the 200 tons of the company's scheduled tonnage. Jardine Matheson's new printed Burma route is to rent the British merchant ship Chang'an, which has a deadweight of 10,000 tons, and travels to Singapore, India, Calcutta, and Borneo's Penage. The ship left Shanghai on the afternoon of the 25th and set sail on the route for the first time, carrying more than 2,000 tons of cargo;</p>
<h3>Inland Branches of Various Banks Increase Deposit Interest Rates; Financial Network Can Be Completed Within the Year; More Than 500 Branches Have Been Established</h3>
<p>In order to circulate inland finance and strengthen economic power, the Ministry of Finance formulated a two-year plan to complete the financial network in the southwest, northwest, and neighboring war zones, and ordered the four banks of China, Central, Communications, and Agriculture, as well as the banking industry associations, to complete it by the end of 1940. After the four banks and the provincial banks, local banks, and commercial banks and money houses were ordered to comply, they have generally established branch offices, mutually contacted and remitted money, promoted agricultural loans, and absorbed ordinary savings, which has achieved great results;</p>
<p>Branch Offices Widely Established</p>
<p>After the four banks of China, Central, Communications, and Agriculture were ordered, they immediately established branch offices in various places. The Central Bank has 33, the Bank of China has 59, the Bank of Communications has 26, and the Agricultural Bank of China has 36, totaling 154. Including the previous branch offices of the four banks across the country, there are more than 350. In addition, the banks of Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Anhui, Hubei, Fujian, Jiangsu, and other provinces and local banks have newly established 100 branch offices. As for commercial banks such as Shanghai, Zhejiang Xingye, Continental, Zhongnan, Jin Cheng, Yanyun, Xinhua, Siming, China Industrial, and Tongshang, the total number of branch offices added in the interior has exceeded 50;</p>
<p>Deposit Interest Rates Increased Inland</p>
<p>After the banking industry was ordered to collect idle funds, increase production, balance prices, and stabilize society, and strive to promote savings business, it ordered the branch offices of banks in the southwest, northwest, and interior to increase interest rates and absorb savings. For fixed-term deposits of one year, the interest rate is from 8% to 1% per week, while the deposit interest rate in the Shanghai concession area is reduced appropriately, so that idle funds in Shanghai can be transferred to the interior for national development. As for the four banks of China, Central, Communications, and Agriculture, in view of the fact that the promotion of savings business in the past was mostly focused on cities, and smaller counties and other industrial and commercial concentration areas lacked storage institutions, and the current activities of workers, farmers, merchants, and vendors are quite active, and convenience should be given to savings, special simple savings offices have been established, stipulating a floating deposit of 5% and a fixed-term one-year interest rate of 1% as the principle;</p>
<h3>The Telephone Company Attempts to Increase Prices Should Be Stopped</h3>
<p>The company's annual report shows that its business is booming and setting new records; The Shanghai First Special District Citizens' Federation recently sent a letter to the Public Concession Engineering Bureau, stating that the Shanghai Telephone Company intends to change its charging methods and implement a huge price increase. All sectors of society believe that the company's business is booming after the war, and there is no need to increase prices in fact, and the proposed price increase methods are as exploitative as possible;</p>
<p>Public Opinion is Aroused</p>
<p>Deeply surprised; The association has also received reports from users requesting the transfer of letters to the relevant authorities to stop it. After the Shanghai Telephone Company implemented charging according to the number of calls in 1936, the burden on users has increased. When the Sino-Japanese War broke out, the environment in Shanghai was special, the population increased sharply, and the industry and commerce also showed abnormal prosperity, and the company's telephone revenue reached a record high over the years. According to the company's own statement in the 1939 annual business report, "Due to the increase in newly installed telephones and the increased use of installed households, the number of calls this year has greatly increased. A total of 102,000,000 calls were made in 1937, 126,000,000 calls were made last year, and 198,000,000 calls were made this year." It also stated that "As of the end of the year, there were a total of 77,554 telephones in use, an increase of 19,165 from before the war."</p>
<p>Good Business</p>
<p>Sufficient to prove; As for the increase in the company's expenses over the years, it is also unnecessary to say anything in the autumn of rising prices, but judging from the company's business conditions, it should be enough to offset it. The detailed reasons for this price increase have not yet been officially published. What has been seen in the newspapers is only that the company plans to install a total of about 16,000 new households, and the cost of purchasing machines has increased sharply. This may be the biggest reason for the price increase, but the company's increase in telephones is to increase the company's assets. To seek compensation, it can only appropriately increase the deposit fee for new households, and it is extremely obvious that it cannot use this to seek a general price increase. I think that when talking about</p>
<p>One of the public utilities, should be charged at a low price, to facilitate the public as the purpose, for the special letter to reach, please comply with the situation, for the company's application for price increase, give a serious review, to benefit the industrial and commercial industries, I can not pray enough;</p>
<h3>Shanghai Merchants' Goods Detained in Vietnam; Prepared to Return to Hong Kong and Transport to Rangoon; Now Sorting Out Supporting Documents and Powers of Attorney; Returning to Shanghai is More Expensive and Less Economical</h3>
<p>Regarding the detained goods of Chinese merchants in Vietnam that were detained by the Chengnan Government Motor Vehicle Company, which has been approved for release, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce submitted a request to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs through Jingyao to protest to the Vietnamese government, and telegraphed the Saigon Chinese General Chamber of Commerce to negotiate with the Vietnamese authorities nearby. It has been nearly a month since then. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce of this city only received a telegram from the Saigon Chamber of Commerce the day before yesterday, stating that after repeated negotiations, the Vietnamese government</p>
<p>Has the Intention to Release</p>
<p>However, the original owner of the goods must submit the supporting documents and powers of attorney to the association so that it can make a strong appeal to the Vietnamese government again. It is already noted in yesterday's newspaper that the Municipal Chamber of Commerce has recently sent letters to the relevant industries, instructing them to retrieve the supporting documents and powers of attorney of all goods detained in Vietnam so that they can be sent to the Saigon Chamber of Commerce as the basis for negotiation. The factories and businesses in this port have now started to sort out the certificates and powers of attorney and will send them to the</p>
<p>Municipal Chamber of Commerce</p>
<p>One side is preparing the transportation procedures for the return of the goods to Hong Kong and Shanghai. According to the opinions of manufacturers, it is believed that if the detained goods can be released smoothly through negotiation, it will be decided to return to Hong Kong only, and it is not intended to be transported to Shanghai again, because this item of goods has been delayed for a long time. After a little sorting out, it is urgent to transport it to the interior. If it is transported from Hong Kong to Yangon and then imported into the southwest and other places via the Yunnan-Vietnam Road, the time and cost will be cheaper and faster, so as to avoid the complicated procedures of transporting it from Shanghai to Hong Kong. All the goods have been detained until now, which has reached several months, and the loss of merchants has really been considerable. It is hoped that the Vietnamese government can take into account the difficulties of merchants, comply with public opinion, maintain the past friendly relations, and stop making things difficult and release them as soon as possible. In addition, the 1,000 tons of cotton yarn cloth and groceries loaded from Shanghai on the British merchant ship Granton, the first direct flight between Shanghai and Myanmar at the end of last month, has been notified that it has arrived in Yangon and has been unloaded ashore;</p>
<h3>The Detained Ships Have Been Protested, and the Japanese Side Has Not Yet Released Them; The American Dasheng Ship Was Harassed From the Time It Was Detained; Passengers and Crew Members Hid Their Money and Belongings</h3>
<p>The German ships Moufu and Feikang and the American ship Dasheng, which were detained in the waters of Zhejiang, have been under surveillance by the Japanese side in the waters of Zhoushan for nearly a month. Although the German and American consuls in Shanghai have repeatedly lodged protests, the Japanese side has always refused to release them on the grounds that they are still under investigation. The news that the shipping industry has released that it will be released soon is also a general speculation. According to inquiries from all parties yesterday, the Japanese authorities still have no official reply that it can be released soon. As for the passengers on each ship, they have already landed in Zhoushan and transferred to Japanese ships to Shanghai. In addition, the Haifu ship of the German shipping company Lihua Yangxing has not yet sailed out of the Oujiangkou. It is reported that the passengers on board the ship have landed in Yueqing and will take a ride to Shanghai when the ship is scheduled to set sail. It is generally expected that it will have to wait until the Moufu and Feikang ships are released and return to Shanghai before they can set sail;</p>
<p>Recalling the Process of Dasheng's Detention; A passenger yesterday recalled to reporters the process of the Dasheng ship being detained by the Japanese Navy on the 1st of this month, saying that the Dasheng ship was intercepted by a Japanese Navy cruiser 10 hours away from Shanghai. The ship originally intended to tow the Dasheng ship away, but because the ship's side was loose and the masts were also damaged, it no longer towed it the next day. For the next two days, the Dasheng ship was forced to follow the cruiser. On the third day, it was handed over to a Japanese military transport ship and taken to Dinghai. After arriving in Dinghai, passengers on the ship were still not allowed to go ashore. It was not until the 11th of this month that the ship's comprador contacted the Japanese ship Haitong to transfer to Shanghai. When the Dasheng ship was intercepted by the Japanese Navy, there was a great disturbance on the ship. The crew members ran back and forth to hide their money and belongings, and the passengers threw letters and other items into the sea. In addition to 37 passengers, there were also 20 Chinese sailors and 1 foreign shipowner on the Dasheng ship;</p>
<h3>Western Detective Smith Resigns to Join the Military</h3>
<p>Western Detective Back Smith of the Public Concession Police Department has served for seven years and has always been highly valued by his superiors for his excellent performance. Recently, due to his eagerness to serve the country, he has submitted his resignation to the Police Department and will leave Shanghai on Wednesday (27th) to join the British Royal Navy. Chinese and Western colleagues of the Police Department held a farewell banquet for Mr. Bae at the Police Department Club on Fuzhou Road the day before yesterday (23rd). At the banquet, Deputy Chief Inspector Robertson delivered a speech, praising Mr. Bae's past achievements in the Police Department. Finally, colleagues from the Police Department presented him with a silver cigarette case and silver flowers and other souvenirs, on which appropriate words were engraved, as well as the names of the presenter and the recipient;</p>
<h3>The French Concession's Rent Ban Infringes Upon Legal Rights</h3>
<p>The chairman of the French Concession Rent Research Committee, Duke, recently drafted a rent ban and distributed it to the members of the committee for research. Residents in the concession are paying close attention to this. A reporter from Paiming Society sought the opinions of all parties. According to reports, in terms of law, the Rent Research Committee has no right to legislate. Collecting small rents, although there is no legal basis, is essentially different from the nature of extortion in criminal law. It seems that it is not entirely in accordance with legal principles to convict it of extortion. There are already regulations in civil law for unreasonable rent increases and high prices. Moreover, the sovereignty of the concession still belongs to the territorial country, so all laws in the French Concession should be based on Chinese law. How can we abandon what is inherent in Chinese law and come up with this so-called ban that is unnecessary and destroys the sovereignty of the territorial country? This argument is not to defend the collection of small rents, but to say that matters concerning national sovereignty are major and cannot be echoed casually;</p>
<h3>Beggar Asylum: Opening Soon, Capacity 1,500</h3>

<p>Winter Clothing Arrives Soon</p>
<p>According to Western sources yesterday, when the President Cleveland mail ship arrives in Shanghai early next month, it will bring a large quantity of new and used clothing to be distributed to European refugees in the city to help them keep warm. The clothing includes inner and outer garments for men, women, and children, as well as shoes, socks, scarves, and so on. Most of these clothes will be given to refugees from German-occupied areas of Europe. Although the refugees in the European Refugee Camp on Huishan Road in this city have food and lodging, they still lack warm winter clothing. Therefore, these clothes are like timely rain.</p>
<p>Distributing Rice Tickets</p>
<p>According to Major Maruyama of the Salvation Army, in addition to preparing to shelter beggars and providing small loans for self-help, the Salvation Army is also distributing a large number of rice tickets. Each ticket can be used to collect five *sheng* of rice at five designated locations in the two settlements. This is to help impoverished citizens and will continue even after the Beggar Asylum is established. Furthermore, for the purpose of helping poor people from other provinces who are stranded in Shanghai return to their hometowns, the Salvation Army will also purchase boat tickets and send them back if they have guarantors and apply for assistance.</p>

<h3>Negotiations Held Yesterday Still Failed to Reach a Resolution</h3>
<p>The labor dispute at the French Tramway Company continued. At 5:15 PM yesterday, six labor representatives, including Gu Jingeng and Zhou Guoxiang, carried 14 unresolved demands and held talks with the company's manager, Favre, to discuss solutions. The political director of the French Municipal Council, Marais, and others attended. The negotiations lasted two and a half hours and did not produce any concrete results. Only Article 5 of the above four articles was fully accepted: (When a worker becomes ill, the employer should immediately send them to the hospital, provide a third-class ward, and the employer should bear the medical expenses and pay wages during the illness). In addition, the employer also agreed that the executive director of the labor union could have ten days of leave per month. As for the severance pay method, the employer will give three months of salary (including allowances) to those who have worked for five years or more. Although the employer discussed and negotiated each of the remaining conditions one by one for a long time, a solution that satisfied both parties was not achieved. It is reported that the labor representatives will carefully discuss the results of yesterday's negotiations, make some modifications to the conditions, submit them to the political department, and then agree with the employer to continue negotiations.</p>
<h3>Feliu Returns to Shanghai from Northern Trip: Reported to the Bureau for Duty Yesterday Morning</h3>

<h3>Western Public School Moves to British Barracks</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council recently decided to move the Western Public School into the barracks left by the British troops next to the Zhaofeng Park. The parents of the school's students have strongly opposed this decision, and their emotions are running high. The Municipal Council is still keeping silent on this matter and only stated that the Bureau's Works Department and Education Department are considering this matter. According to a spokesman for the Municipal Council, it is difficult to say what has been decided or what has not been decided. All that can be said is that the matter is under consideration. At the same time, the parents of the Western Public School students were still indignant yesterday (the 26th) and expressed their opposition, saying that choosing this school site is not only inconvenient due to the long distance, but also the location is not very safe, and the barracks buildings themselves are not suitable for renovation. A part of them has been damaged after the British troops withdrew and no one took care of them. It will cost more than 100,000 yuan to make them suitable for school use. Furthermore, the fact that the parents of the students were not consulted at all before the school site was moved was also strongly opposed. The Western Public School for Boys is the oldest foreign educational institution in the city. The school building was originally located near Hongkou Park. However, when the Shanghai War broke out in 1937, it had to be moved out. It is currently temporarily holding classes at 282 Kaina Road and plans to move into the former British barracks next to Zhaofeng Garden next semester.</p>

<h3>Rickshaw Puller Beaten to Death: Defendant Acquitted</h3>
<p>Xu Wang, a woman from Yangzhou, recently hired a lawyer at the Special Court No. 1 Criminal Division to sue Qiu Deji (also known as Xiao Guangdong), the owner of the rickshaw company at 416 Shanhai Lane, Shanhai Road, and Zhou Asan, Shuangxi, and others for jointly injuring her husband, Xu Quanbai, resulting in his death. The prosecution's gist was that her husband made a living pulling rickshaws. At about 1:00 PM on the 28th of last month, he went to the defendant's company to take over the shift and had a dispute over the order of pulling rickshaws. The rickshaw owner, Xiao Guangdong, first punched him and kicked him in the abdomen, and then ordered the two or three defendants to surround him and beat him severely, causing him to die shortly afterward. This constituted the crime of murder under Article 271 of the Criminal Code and was accompanied by a civil suit for 15,120 yuan, calculated at three yuan per day for fourteen years, plus 250 yuan for funeral expenses, requesting that compensation be ordered. The Special Court No. 1 heard the case several times. The defendants, Zhou Asan and Shuangxi, did not appear. Only Qiu Deji hired lawyer Wu Peng to appear in court and stated that this fact was an unfounded accusation by the plaintiff, attempting to achieve the purpose of extortion, and requested that the court declare him not guilty. After the interrogation was concluded, Judge Liu ruled Qiu Deji not guilty yesterday morning, dismissed the plaintiff's civil suit, and suspended the trial for Zhou Asan and Shuangxi.</p>

<h3>Rumors Suddenly Arise: Gold Market Advances Circuitously, Surpassing the 5,700 Yuan Mark</h3>
<p>Yesterday's gold market fluctuated erratically in the black market, rising in the morning, falling at noon, and then rising again in the afternoon. Prices surpassed the 5,700 Yuan mark. This was due to the foreign exchange US dollar, which went from tight to loose amidst various rumors, with the military trend softening in the afternoon. The widespread rumor of a "New Central Bank" opening on the 5th of next month sparked buying, causing the market to open at 5,710 Yuan. Under the buying pressure from silver firms and money shops, it soared to 5,730 Yuan. The sudden reversal of the tight foreign exchange market caused gold firms and silver firms to rush to sell, leading to a downward trend. At noon, a certain atmosphere suddenly intensified, with the noon closing price at a low of 5,675 Yuan. In the afternoon, the US dollar exchange rate tightened again, and securities firms and small money shops re-entered the market, causing the price to rise again above 5,700 Yuan, eventually reaching 5,715 Yuan, with a further squeeze up to 5,717 Yuan. The total daily transaction volume was 4,560 taels. Swap buyers offered approximately 7 Yuan to sellers. In the spot market, a certain jewelry store and gold firm sold a total of two hundred and several tens of taels to small money shops, with the price being 7 Yuan lower than the futures price, later needing to be about 10 Yuan lower. Jewelry gold rose 10 Yuan, reaching 590 Yuan. Customs gold and others remained flat. In the early morning, foreign exchange was reported tight, and the opening buying sentiment was still good, jumping up more than 50 Yuan from the previous day's closing price. It was estimated that gold firms took in 20 taels from silver firms at 5,510 Yuan, and the silver firms showed strong interest in taking in, purchasing a significant amount, then raised the price by 20 Yuan. It was reported that money exchange businesses entered gold firms with 30 taels, at a price of 5,730 Yuan. At that time, favorable rumors were rife, and the foreign exchange market was indeed tightening. However, because gold and silver firms, securities firms, and others were willing to sell at the high price, the rising trend was thwarted, falling to 5,685 Yuan. Still, because the exchange market remained soft, sellers hesitated, and prices rose again above the 5,700 Yuan mark. It was estimated that money exchange businesses did 30 taels, at a price of 5,710 Yuan. After 11 o'clock, the foreign exchange rate remained flat, and the transaction volume was also strong at that time. A certain client took in two to three hundred taels, but encountered scattered sellers, and the closing price was pushed down to 5,675 Yuan.

Gold firms entered silver firms with 20 taels, at 5,678 Yuan. Money exchange businesses released 10 taels to securities firms, at 5,675 Yuan. At that time, securities firms purchased, raising the price to 5,705 Yuan. However, shortly after, it dropped by 15 Yuan again, to 5,690 Yuan. Subsequently, gold firms, retail investors, and others successively took in, and gold firms did 30 taels, reaching 5,712 Yuan. Silver firms released 20 taels to money exchange businesses, at 5,705 Yuan. Before the market closed, buying sentiment was good, reaching 5,723 Yuan. As a result, silver firms released thirty taels to money exchange businesses, with the evening closing price at 5,715 Yuan, a squeeze up of 47 Yuan from the previous day, with a fluctuation of 55 Yuan throughout the day. The current selling price of cash gold from Yuan Ben brand was more than 10 Yuan higher than the black market price, and the buying price was 30 Yuan lower.

<h3>Foreign Currencies Rise in Unison</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market saw the black market price rise again above the 700 Yuan mark. British and American gold pounds each rose by 1 Yuan. British gold notes showed a slightly weak trend, retreating to 50 Yuan and 5 Jiao in the evening market. American gold notes showed an upward trend, due to the intense rumors regarding the imminent establishment of the new "Central Bank," causing unease. The evening market rose to 16 Yuan, 7 Jiao, and 7 Fen, a further increase of 1 Jiao and 7 Fen from the previous day. Hong Kong notes pierced the 4 Yuan mark, with the evening market at 4 Yuan and 1 Fen. Japanese gold notes gradually became firmer, with the evening market rising back to 1 Yuan, 5 Jiao, and 4 Fen. Korean notes had balanced supply and demand, with the evening market still standing at 1 Yuan, 1 Jiao, and 4 Fen.</p>
<h3>Securities: Sufficient to Show China's Strong Credit; London Foreign Debt Turns Favorable in Unison</h3>
<p>Securities in the grey market, with rumors acting as negative news, the market was already at its peak. Many floated out suddenly, and the market price suddenly rose and fell. The morning saw a very severe decline, and the afternoon stabilized slightly, with large rises and small corrections. This is the normal process for the bond market, and it is not worth taking seriously. The rumors are especially not to be believed. Only sporadic small investors sold in the market, and large investors did not come out at all. The market still has a shortage of cash. The future may be temporarily hovering. Yesterday morning, the opening price was only a small 2 Jiao, due to the sudden tightening of foreign exchange and the sudden rise in gold. Lianhe, Sheng, Da, and Wanchun were the first to sell. Category C immediately broke through 64 Yuan. Dingkang, Runde, and Yichang also sold. Hengfu first sold and then bought back. Yitai, Hongda, Runli, Wuyuan, and Lemao all bought in. The noon closing plummeted by several Jiao to more than one Yuan. In the afternoon, Xinfu also bought in, and Renchang also replenished a lot. Yitai continued to buy in, and Lianhe, Changkang, and Shunchang also needed it. Category C once reached the Yuan price, but then Lanyi, Xiekang, Tongkang, Tai, and Dechang sold out and continued to loosen, but it was slightly firmer than in the morning. The result was a unanimous return of a small 5 Jiao and a half to 8 Jiao and a half. The total number of transactions totaled more than 3 million Yuan. A brief table is listed below.</p>
<p>Stock Trading Transactions Huacheng Tobacco Company shares 4 → shares, the price was 46 Yuan and 5 Jiao.</p>
<p>The stock market of the Public Industry Association was extremely idle, and the prices were almost unchanged from the previous few days. Transactions in both industrial and rubber stocks were rare. At the close of the market, people's hearts were slightly downward.</p>
<p>London, 25th (Monday) Telegram, Today's listed market prices for Chinese foreign debt and Far Eastern British merchant companies' stocks, Chinese debt unanimously turned favorable, rising from 1 pound to 4 pounds.

<h3>Grain: Imported Rice Still Arrives, More Than 12,000 Bags; Not Being Controlled is to Not Manipulate</h3>
<p>Yesterday's market for imported rice became even more active due to the activity of speculative hoarding households. Rumors emerged endlessly. There were reports that Hong Kong quotations had risen, so the buying spirit became even higher, and the market price continued to rise. Saigon No. 1 and No. 2 rice became even more of an excitement catalyst due to the Vietnam issue. Xiaowen rice, which used to be priced the same as Saigon No. 2, was not able to be used for rumors and exploitation because of the convenient transportation to Burma and Hong Kong and the continuous flow of sources. And it also did not arouse the interest of general blindly hoarding households. Their "football" transactions were naturally no longer favored. Therefore, the same cash, No. 2 and Xiaowen, actually had a difference of two or three Yuan. Futures and road goods all had a difference of two Yuan. Yesterday, Saigon No. 1 and No. 2, Yanghua, and Siteng rose by more than one Yuan, while Xiaowen, Dahua, and Si were just hovering. Selling opened December Xiaowen at 80 Yuan, 0 Jiao, and 4.5 Fen, and at one point in the afternoon it was as low as 80 Yuan, 0 Jiao, and 2 Fen. The evening closing last night was still 80 Yuan, 0 Jiao, and 4.5 Fen, the same as the night before. Compared to this, Saigon No. 1 cash is from 87 Yuan to 88 Yuan and a half, No. 2 cash is 84 Yuan and a half, November is 83 Yuan and a half and 82 Yuan and a half, and December is 82 Yuan, 6 Jiao, and 7 Fen, all larger than the previous day by more than Yuan. Trading was active in both directions, with a transaction volume of 1,200 to 1,300 tons of cash. In addition to being actually consumed by local customers, it was also favored by hoarding households. The price rose by about 1 Yuan, and the transaction volume also exceeded 10,000 bags.</p>
<p>Imported rice continues to arrive in Shanghai. Yesterday, Taikoo Company's Liangzhou wheel, loaded with 4,894 bags from Hong Kong, arrived in port yesterday morning and berthed at the company's wharf on the Bund of the French Concession for unloading. Jardine Matheson &amp; Co.'s Yusheng wheel arrived in port at 5 pm yesterday and berthed at Zhasifu Wharf. It is estimated that 16,275 bags were transported from Hong Kong and will begin unloading this morning. (Zu)</p>
<p>New Japonica and Medicinal Seeds, etc., a total of more than 1,000 stones arrived. On the sales side, the general local street guests saw imported rice tightening and were unanimously optimistic, and their appetites were also strong. Therefore, the owners worked very hard to shout out, and as a result, the selling price also rose by Yuan Cu. It was heard that the original packaged New Japonica was 93 Yuan, followed by 90 Yuan and 0 Jiao and 5 Fen, True Special was 93 Yuan and 8 Jiao, Bulk was seen at 89 Yuan and 86 Yuan and 2 Jiao, Green Horn Tea Seed was 81 Yuan and 8 Jiao to 80 Yuan and 0 Jiao and 5 Fen, Feilaifeng was 82 Yuan and a half. Du Yangjian was short of goods and there was no market.</p>
<p>Glutinous rice sales have not been very smooth, so Guonuo is just so-so, still opening at 85 Yuan and a half. However, Hong Kong glutinous rice also brought up the opening slightly due to rising quotations, with Special at 77 to 78 Yuan and Zhongguan at 75 Yuan.</p>
<h3>Third Batch of Imported Flour: Contract Price 18 Yuan and 2.5 Jiao</h3>
<p>Flour: The flour market has entered a stable state. It was found that the No. 2 flour mill officially increased its price by one Yuan the day before, and it may not move for a while. The rising wind of various returned goods has also gradually subsided. For example, after the old Che Zhan single rose to a high price of 20 Yuan, it is difficult to rise any further. The market price of imported flour once followed the factory price and shouted high, but yesterday it also stood at between 19 Yuan, 5 Jiao, and 6 Fen and 19 Yuan. This is because the local street has newly ordered a third batch of futures imported flour, 20,000 bags to be delivered in December, at a contract price of 18 Yuan and 2 Jiao and a half. Therefore, the tense situation of current flour has gradually dissipated. The two factories in the city have approved a total of about 8,000 bags, the price is still 18 Yuan, and the customer price is 19 Yuan. Because the production of each factory is insufficient, the quantity supplied is very limited.</p>
<p>Wheat: Yesterday's wheat market situation did not break away from the firm and quiet situation. After the self-opening price rose to 28 Yuan, the Chinese factories also planned to absorb it at this price. However, the arrival of goods was scarce, and they were all designated to be delivered to Japanese factories to limit the price. It was heard that more than 200 bags of wheat were sent from nearby Kunshan and Taicang to the Sanxin Factory, but the price has not yet been officially set. The market transaction is still silent and lacks new transactions.</p>
<p>Mr. Wang Zizhang, please come to the museum for a discussion immediately.</p>
<h3>Oil Cake: Soybean Sales are Thin; Oil Prices Rise Instead</h3>
<p>Yesterday's oil market did not show any sign of loosening. Because manipulators used the effect of air and favorable rumors were strong, buying was strong and the market price was high. Unlike soybean sales, which were thin and still buried in a tired state. According to statistics, 150 Dan of Dayou Factory soybean oil were made, the price was 80 Yuan to 81 Yuan, 80 pieces of Yanqi soybean oil, the price was 74 Yuan and 5 Jiao, 100 pieces of Jiaozhou soybean oil, the price was 72 Yuan and 5 Jiao, 450 pieces of Jiaozhou raw oil, the price was 74 Yuan, 2 Jiao, and a half to 75 Yuan and 5 Jiao, 700 cans of Yantai butter, the price was 106 Yuan and 5 Jiao, 140 barrels of Qingdao raw oil, the price was 103 Yuan and 5 Jiao to 04 Yuan. The above destinations are local street, Hong Kong, Taiwan, etc. Futures transactions were 1,500 to 1,600 barrels of Qingdao raw oil to be delivered in December, the price was 103 Yuan, 7 Jiao, and a half to 105 Yuan, the closing price was 04 Yuan, 7 Jiao, and a half.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Under the Manipulation of Outsiders, the Yarn Market is Unstable from Now On</h3>
<p>The yarn market, which had rebounded the day before, weakened again yesterday and entered a revolving route. This is because the actual transaction volume was reduced compared to the previous day. However, the Hong Kong gang's demand for 32-count single yarn continued unabated, so the selling price was uniquely firm. The sales of 20-count yarn were slightly inferior, so speculators who made profits vomited again, and the market price fell back. Looking at the current situation, it is still hovering. Considering the cotton yarn itself, it can be stable, but ordinary outsiders enter and exit from time to time, resulting in an unstable situation.</p>
<p>Shuangma Morning Opening Trend: Firm. Because it closed at a high level the day before, the bulls were very dense. The first plate of 20-count Shuangma was priced at 1,225 Yuan, up 5 Cu, back and forth three or four times more than 1,220 Yuan. Then, because the foreign exchange shrank slightly by 0.3125, the bulls deliberately shouted loudly, and the buying power was slightly strong for a while, rising to 1,232 Yuan in an instant. However, seeing the high price, those who made profits believed that the current sales were not as strong as the previous day and wanted to end. The market price gradually declined to 1,219 Yuan. At this time, the bulls still struggled, until more than half past eleven, the speculative wind was not good, and they sold off one after another, continuing to fall to 1,210 Yuan. The closing price was 1,210 Jiao Yuan. The statistics of the intraday transactions of the cattle were 6,150 Yuan, and the market price of 20-count Ma fell by 7 Yuan. The amount of each gang purchased is listed as follows:</p>
<p>Hong Kong 515 Fellow Travelers 5,650 Statistics 6,200</p>
<h3>Cotton Remains Silent</h3>
<p>The current cotton situation is not very interesting, and the overall situation is still stable. As for the factory sides, Shenxin and Yongan factories, the appetite is flat, and the factories such as Xinyuhongzhang have lower yarn prices, which are nearly 100 Yuan different from the Shuangma selling price, and their intention to purchase raw materials is even weaker. Therefore, the cotton market is more and more hesitant, unable to rise or fall.</p>
<p>The market price of foreign cotton, the New York cotton market, initially bought by the same industry, and then sold by spot merchants and liquidated by some bulls. As a result, the closing price fell 5 to 6 pounds lower than the previous day. India fell more than two rupees again yesterday.</p>
<p>The transaction of foreign cotton in Shanghai has always been unusually quiet these days. The factory side has no intention to purchase for the time being, and the transaction between the same industry is very light. I have not heard of any transactions.</p>
<p>A large batch of Indian cotton arrived, and the day before, the Great British Company's Sinmali wheel transported 7,130 pieces of cotton from Mumbai, which arrived in port on the morning of the 24th and berthed at Qichang Stack in Pudong for unloading. (Zu)</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Cloth Increases "Factory Tax," Implemented Next Month, It is Said</h3>
<p>Factory Cloth: The market started to rise and then became tired, because the new rise in the cloth market had not yet gained a firm foothold, and the increase in the uniform factory tax was heard to be implemented from the first day of next month, and because of the end-of-month advance payment relationship, the market was slightly firm, the number of sellers suddenly increased, the market price rose once, and then fell back in an instant. The result was flat, with slight differences in coarse and fine cloth, bleached cloth, and grey cloth. The factory price remained firm, and Yihua Factory's Jin Sanda bleached cloth opened more than 50 boxes, the price was 41 Yuan per piece, and the local street stores were the most prosperous in small batches. Various wholesale stores purchased more than 600 pieces of grey cloth, bleached cloth, flannel, and coarse cloth. The Cantonese and Hong Kong gangs purchased more than 300 pieces of printed cloth, bleached cloth, Guangzhong, Hongzhang, and other factories' silk fabric, and coarse and fine cloth and twill from Lunchang, Yihua, and other factories. The Zhejiang and Fujian gangs purchased more than 100 pieces of colored cloth, bleached cloth, khaki, etc.</p>
<p>Dongbu first rose and then fell, and the selling plate was weak. Longtou fine cloth opened at 35 Yuan, 5 Jiao, and 6 Fen in the morning, and the retail sellers in the market were very active, so it fell straight to 34 Yuan and 9 Jiao in a short time. The after-market also opened tired, and then rose to 35 Yuan, 2 Jiao, and a half to close due to the same industry's replenishment. Four Gentlemen Serge was 1 Yuan and 8 Fen.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Red and White Sugar Rebound</h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market rebounded slightly due to the tightening of foreign exchange. The Association's fixed price, cash No. 24 coarse white, was 72 Yuan and 9 Jiao at the factory, up 3 Jiao. The goods from foreign factories were slightly loose, cash was 71 Yuan and 8 Jiao, the monthly 30th beating single was 71 Yuan and 9 Jiao, Holland cotton white rose nearly Yuan, BS Mac factory goods were 71 Yuan, Holland red cash rose 7 Jiao, to 50 Yuan and 9 Jiao, Taikoo Che Bai B Mac West Stack was 75 Yuan, 2 Jiao to 75 Yuan, later 74 Yuan and 9 Jiao, up 5 to 6 Jiao, East Stack was 74 Yuan and 6 Jiao, DY Mac West Stack was 68 Yuan and a half, East Stack was 68 Yuan and 2 Jiao, HX Mac West Stack was 68 Yuan and 3 Jiao, East Stack was 68 Yuan, up 2 to 3 Jiao. There were 100 bags of sugar from Hong Kong to Shanghai on the 26th.</p>

<h3>Regarding "Married Women"</h3>
<p>— Sha Xinyuan</p>
<p>The issue of the post office not employing female staff was discussed some months ago, and a strong case was made. The result was a victory, but unfortunately, it was incomplete. You see, in the post office's advertisement for "Junior Postal Staff," women are now included in the "qualifications" section, but these "qualifications" still have "conditions"! — Just read the "Eligibility" section: "All citizens of the Republic of China (excluding married women)... are eligible to apply." This cannot but attract the attention of all sectors of society, especially the women's sector, which should not be overlooked.</p>
<p>From the post office's perspective, they have made a concession. Women "theoretically" did not have the "qualifications," but now they are actually listed among them, which is cause for women to celebrate and be "overwhelmed with favor." But let's think about it. A high school graduate is at least eighteen or nineteen years old, and even those who marry later are only twenty-five or twenty-six. (Due to physiological reasons, it is not advisable for women to marry too late.) This is equivalent to saying that a woman's "useful" period is eight years, and the other fifty or sixty years should be "lived in vain." In this way — according to the post office's calculation, a woman's "life" can only be counted as eight years. We don't know what to say about this.</p>
<p>Therefore, what follows is that women, in order to seek economic independence and further seek equal status between men and women, end up "sacrificing" marriage. — In order not to give up the post office's "golden rice bowl," they have no choice but to endure the pain. Here, I cannot help but congratulate our Republic of China that the post office employs so few women, otherwise, we would have no descendants and become extinct!</p>
<p>The post office is a "national institution," and it openly does not hire "married women," not to mention other companies, foreign firms, and shops. At the same time, this undoubtedly says, "Women should return to the home to specialize in producing 'cannon fodder,' and should not be concerned with social affairs."</p>
<p>We do not believe that the wise postal authorities are not considering ways to accommodate the special physiological needs of women (maternity leave before and after childbirth, which, according to statistics, averages no more than two years of rest for each woman in her lifetime), but instead are "turning their attention" to depriving citizens of their rights. Is it that Chinese women are not able to participate in social activities? Is it that Chinese society has advanced so rapidly that it no longer needs women to do things? Is it saying that China already has 450 million people, and women cannot have both employment and marriage, otherwise China will suffer from overpopulation? We cannot find appropriate solutions to these problems!</p>
<p>Our female compatriots, this is a matter of vital importance. You should continue to strive for progress with the spirit of "struggle" from the past, and you must not remain silent; you must know that this is not just a matter of individual women, but a major issue for the entire country, the entire nation, and even the entire world. Especially in China today, to obliterate the strength of women is to invite self-destruction. We hope that all sectors of society will pay attention, and that the postal authorities will also consider this matter carefully!</p>
<p>Here, especially the women's sector cannot remain silent!</p>
<h3>A Group That Specializes in Tearing Down Posters</h3>
<p>— Yu Jun</p>
<p>For the past three years, the people of Shanghai have continued to live a life of pleasure and dissipation, seeking only to satisfy their own selfish desires, without regard for the welfare of the masses. However, there is no shortage of clear-headed and insightful people who do not abandon their responsibilities and actively and energetically engage in work that benefits society. However, these people are rarely noticed by society.</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, I unintentionally discovered something that is worth recording. As I was walking at the corner of Avenue Foch and a certain road, around 6:00 AM, when there were still few people on the street, I saw two or three young men around the age of twenty tearing down posters on the wall. They seemed to be organized, and they were holding small scrapers and cloth bags, putting the torn pieces of paper into the bags. I noticed that they were tearing down advertisements for nude performances at theaters, and I began to understand the significance of their work. I sincerely asked them for the details.</p>
<p>They said: "Although this group of workers does not have a formal organization, there are several others who take the same action. They always come out to do this work early in the morning or at night when there are few people, specializing in tearing down those improper posters, such as advertisements for nude performances at theaters or theaters that use pornography to lure young people; advertisements for 'curing leukorrhea' and 'miracle pills' at pharmacies and halls that deceive people's money. All posters that contain toxins that are sufficient to numb the mind, defraud money, and harm the people are torn down."</p>
<p>Hawthorne Detective Stories</p>
<h3>The Ballerina's Fate</h3>
<p>— By Cheng Xiaoqing</p>
<p>Chapter 12: Report and Explanation</p>
<p>He said in pursuit: "The real killer turned out to be Li Zhifan, which I never expected. I was just wondering, Songquan just brought back a —"</p>
<p>Hawthorne seemed not to have heard the last half of his sentence, and interrupted, "Jinshou, how can you say you didn't expect it? You're too forgetful. When we were discussing at Lilan's house this morning, didn't you say that the Group A shoe print was left by the killer? That insight was completely correct."</p>
<p>Ni Jinshou suddenly looked uneasy. His body twitched, and his eyes avoided the floor. He said slowly, "To be honest, that was just a guess of mine, with no basis. I thought the person with the Group A print might be an outsider, but I didn't expect it to be Li Zhifan. Because I really didn't think he would use Lu Jiansheng's shoes to pull off such a trick."</p>
<p>Hawthorne said, "That's because you focused too much on the gun problem, and therefore overlooked that this was a double murder case."</p>
<p>Ni Jinshou said to himself, "The inside story of this case is really too complicated. I have to admit that my vision is really not clear. So, Li Zhifan's motive for killing Lilan was solely for money?"</p>
<p>Hawthorne nodded and said, "Money is one theme, and there is also the resentment of breaking off the engagement. As I see it —" He suddenly reached into his pocket and took out two pieces of paper from a diary. He looked at the two pieces of paper, and his two shiny eyes turned, as if a change had occurred in his mind. He folded the two pieces of paper that he had taken out again, held them in his hand, and did not let Ni Jinshou see them. He looked up and said, "Jinshou, what kind of report did Songquan give? Tell me about it first, and then we will discuss Li Zhifan's motives and actions, which is more appropriate in terms of procedure."</p>
<p>Ni Jinshou nodded and said, "Okay, let Songquan say it again himself." He rubbed the electric bell button on the side of the desk with his finger. A servant immediately walked in. He ordered, "Call Songquan in."</p>
<p>Hawthorne threw the remaining cigarette butt into the ashtray, and leaned back more comfortably on the sofa, preparing to listen to Songquan's report. Two minutes later, the burly Songquan had entered. I didn't recognize this person either, but looking at his demeanor and the order in which he spoke when reporting, it was clear that he was also a fairly capable person and a rare talent in the detective community.

<h3>Clothing, Food, Housing, and Transportation</h3>

<h3>University Beggar</h3>
<p>— Mingxun</p>
<p>At the intersection of Avenue Edward VII and Avenue Foch, there is a beggar with a emaciated appearance who writes with his fingers dipped in water, in Chinese and English, with clear and elegant handwriting, next to a diploma from a certain university in Nanjing. After reading it, I couldn't help but feel a mix of emotions, and I wrote a short poem:</p>
<p>Unable to find a place to live, he smears himself with mud,</p>
<p>Wearing ragged clothes, his eyes are dark,</p>
<p>He also graduated from university in the past,</p>
<p>Don't say that beggars come from a low background.</p>
<h3>No Chicken</h3>
<p>— Wansui</p>
<p>The price of meat has already risen to more than two yuan per catty, so not eating chicken is naturally not considered shabby. What I worry about is the influx of guests, the nobles with thousands of embroidered shoes. Even without fish, they still want to sing "Let's go home with a long sword!"? How much more without chicken! And that "chicken" is the indispensable "turkey" for the Christmas season.</p>
<p>"Christmas is a foreign festival, not in the category of dragon boat races, where people are free in the heavens. However, is it because 'businessmen' want to do more business, calling it a 'foreign winter solstice'; or is it that 'foreign moons are more beautiful than Chinese ones,' and one has to put on a tuxedo to EVE it up, so the 'foreign festival' is celebrated by everyone in China, and turkey is naturally indispensable. — It is also reported that some people have said that turkey is a Chinese specialty, and expanding the 'foreign winter solstice' is also a way to promote domestic goods.</p>
<p>In that case, it is truly regrettable that the turkeys in the Zhoushan Islands have been completely "controlled" this year!</p>
<p>However, with the European war in full swing, the American expatriates in Shanghai are also continuing to withdraw in batches. The foreign gentlemen's refined interest in this "own festival" may have long been dispelled by greater responsibilities. Even if humorous like Mr. George Bernard Shaw, he would not say "eat chicken to save the country," would he? We seem to have even less reason to generously tell the children that Santa Claus will send sweets and gifts down the chimney!</p>
<p>However, I, who am chewing on vegetable roots, am particularly eager for a taste of turkey this year, because the price of meat has risen to more than two yuan per catty; and because turkey is a specialty of our Zhoushan Islands.</p>

<h3>Solo Recital by National Musician</h3>
<p>— Yiyin</p>
<p>The writer has long admired Mr. Wei Zhongle, a pipa expert, who is famous in the music world and has many students. For the past two years, he has promoted national music and won unanimous praise in the United States. He has worked hard. This summer, he returned to Shanghai for recuperation and was hired as a professor of ancient music at Shanghai University. He also held two recitals on the 20th and 21st of this month at the Wu Liande Hall of the Asian Literary Association on Museum Road.</p>
<p>The program for this recital included seven pipa pieces: "Yangchun Baixue," "Feihua Diancui," "Bawang Xie Jia," "Neon Feather Dress Dance," "Qinglian Music House," "Song and Dance Introduction," and "Huaiyin Pingchu"; two erhu pieces: "Illness Chant" and "Good Night"; and three guqin pieces: "Puan Curse," "Three Variations on Plum Blossoms," and "Drunken Fisherman Singing in the Evening." Due to the enthusiastic requests of the audience at the second session, he continued to play the erhu piece "Under the Moon" and the pipa piece "Wild Geese Descending on the Sand," for a total of fourteen pieces. Mr. Wei's skills in pipa martial music are unique. He is accustomed to using bold and powerful techniques to give the audience the pressure of thunder and lightning, while the exquisite parts are like the stretching and rolling of spring clouds, and the competition of exotic flowers; or like the clear sky and bright sun, and the gentle breeze; or like the misty smoke and moon, and the distant mountains and near trees; or like the flowing clouds and flowing water, and the clinking of broken jade; or like murmuring whispers, telling homely stories, or like painful knots, and tragic indignation, thousands of threads, ... all human emotions and desires, magnificent, disorderly and complicated. And when it is released thousands of miles, it suddenly ends. The guqin and erhu are also equally skilled and flowing, reaching the point of perfection, like the sound of jade pendants, like the chanting of gold and stone, and the sounds linger. Mr. Wei's performance is truly divine, dazzling and breathtaking.</p>
<p>The writer privately hopes that Mr. Wei will hold public recitals from time to time in the future, so that the life of national music will shine brightly again, and promote the progress of national music, promote and develop it, revive national culture, and establish a unique national music; the public will also get pure music to edify and comfort them, which is very fortunate.</p>
<h3>Shi Ping Joins Lu Bao</h3>
<p>— Xingxing</p>
<p>Shi Ping, this newcomer on the screen, used to study at Qiude Girls' High School. In October of last year, when the "Guolian Company recruited students for the song and dance class, Shi Ping, out of love for singing and dancing and Chang Ying, resolutely applied and was admitted. After some training, she officially signed a acting contract with Guolian. Not long ago, there were rumors that Shi Ping was on leave to go to the mainland, and there were also rumors that she was engaged to a certain gentleman. In fact, the plan to go to the mainland did not materialize, and the engagement with a certain gentleman was also unfounded. Now, news has come that she will join the Lu Bao Theater and meet the public on the stage. It turns out that Shi Ping's leave of absence from "Guolian" was indeed a fact. Before this vacation was over, in order to improve her acting skills, she made this move to join Lu Bao. It is said that the date has been set for the beginning of next month.</p>
<p>It is said that the vernacular dramas performed by Lu Bao Theater have always been welcomed by the audience. Now, with the addition of Shi Ping, a newcomer in the film industry with excellent acting skills, it is expected that Lu Bao will be greatly enhanced.</p>
<h3>Portraits of Female Artists</h3>
<p>— Tang Shuo</p>
<p>(7) Gu Lanjun</p>
<p>The general public believes that Gu Lanjun's love affair with Li Ying will damage her artistic prospects. In fact, Gu Lanjun's spirit of loyalty to her job is also undeniable. Now, Gu Lanjun and Li Ying live together in the Huaye Building on Seymour Road. Gu Lanjun has publicly admitted this, and there is no need to avoid it for her. The Huaye Building is an apartment building, and Lanjun has rented two rooms, one of which is a suite. When Lanjun has to film or perform tomorrow, she will move into the suite the night before! Closing the door and quietly memorizing the script, no one is allowed to disturb her, not even Li Ying; this shows that although she needs love, she has not slackened her job, and she is still working hard for her own future at any time.</p>
<p>Lanjun already had a superior position at the Mingxing Film Company. "Peach and Plum争艳" is a work that laid her foundation. After the war, she joined Xinhua and gained a more noble position in the film industry by starring in the film "Diao Chan". After that, it was her golden age. Her love affair with Li Ying occurred when they co-starred in the martial arts film "Huang Tian Shuang", and the recently completed "Bo Ming Hua" is her first crystallization after her union with Li Ying.</p>
<p>The original name of "Bo Ming Hua" was "Money and Love". The content is almost a self-portrait of Lanjun. Lanjun was once favored by Gu Qianlin, a great mountain man who easily obtained her photos for 6,000 yuan. Lanjun's feelings for the mountain man were not bad, but after watching the cartoon "Pinocchio", she was greatly influenced in her thinking. She decided to get rid of the shackles of money, so she opened up another love route and united with Li Ying. The plot of "Bo Ming Hua" is about the change in her love route, but the heroine in the play is not a movie star but a dancer.</p>
<p>Since the plot of "Bo Ming Hua" is produced under this theme, it fully exposes the sin of money playing with women. The producer of this film is Zhang Songtao, Lanjun is his goddaughter, and Li Ying has a teacher-student relationship with him, so Hyun Bulan calls Li Ying "Big Brother", and Li Ying calls Lan Jun "Big Sister". This special name comes from the relationship between the same school.</p>
<p>Lanjun also has considerable interest in drama. In the past, she performed "Qun Ying Luan Fei" with Tang Ruoqing, Xu Xinyuan and others at the Carlton Theater. Recently, she participated in the New Art Theater and played Zheng Chenggong's wife in "Hai Guo Ying Xiong". She is smart, she knows how to grasp the personality of the characters and the atmosphere of the drama, so whether on the screen or on the stage, her acting skills are skillful and successful.</p>
<h3>"Peacock Flies Southeast"</h3>
<p>— Chushui Wangsun</p>
<p>"Peacock Flies Southeast" is about to be made into a movie by冉度. Let's talk about its story here. Jiao Zhongqing, a small official in Lujiang, and Liu Lanzhi are a couple with very good feelings, but Jiao's mother doesn't like her and forces her to be sent back to her home to marry again. He and she agreed that they would not marry and would still be husband and wife. After she returned home, the son of the county magistrate proposed marriage. Although she did not allow it, she could not resist the coercion of her brother and nominally succumbed. He knew about this news and came to find her to meet, and decided to die for love together. One evening, she committed suicide by throwing herself into the river, and after that, he also "hanged himself on a southeastern branch." So, the bodies were buried together, and the two were still husband and wife, but unfortunately they were dead.</p>
<p>Because the poet wrote about the lingering emotions between him and her, the stubbornness of Jiao's mother, the coercion of Liu's brother, and the violence of the government officials in a subtle and winding way, meticulous and subtle, so from "Qi" Liang to now, "Peacock Flies Southeast" has a large readership. Now that it is put on the screen, there is no doubt that "business eyes are very sure. One -- However, this kind of success depends entirely on the adaptation of the script, the director's technique, the arrangement of the pictures, and the technology of the filming. The most important thing is the point of view. What is the theme of "Peacock Flies Southeast"? In short, distortion is not allowed! Pornography is not allowed! Superstition is not allowed! Morality is not allowed!</p>
<p>To make such a literary masterpiece, in addition to not allowing any toxins, the technology also requires extremely precise and careful consideration. The social conditions of the "Han" Dynasty, the clothing of men and women, the form of houses, the structure of streets, and the appearance of furniture, down to a teacup and a clothing button, must be paid attention to: for example, there was no big Chinese match in the Han Dynasty. If the people in the movie used it to cook, wouldn't it be a big joke? These must be requested from history, clothing, and construction experts.</p>
