<p>歐洲戰局在最近一週間之演進，逈不同於旣往九閱月而形成嶄新局勢。歐戰或即以此爲最後階段，至少亦以此爲最重要階段。事關廣大之國際，迢遠之未來，讀者其全神關注之乎！吾人對此，未欲遽作何種批評與推論，竊願加以剖析者數事：其一，有目共覩者，莫如戰事範圍之擴大。溯自最初之德國對波蘭與英法作戰，繼以德國佔丹麥而攻挪威；今則德軍席卷盧森堡，征服荷蘭本國之軍民，直趨比利時而入法境。此一事實所包舉者、參戰國加多，戰區加廣，戰綫加長，敵對之人類加衆。其二。德國之行動，軍事第一；亦即一切取舍、悉以軍事上之利害爲標準；故於彼進攻挪威時，猶有所稱述之論據，猶與英法辯是非曲直，互諉責任；今於荷蘭比利時盧森堡則於行軍之外，在國際外交上亦復　枚疾進矣。此所暗示者，交戰國自德國方面始，爲作戰而不顧一切，否認他國之權利，否認國際法上中立國之權利。其一三，解剖現階段之戰爭全局，以德國爲中心而言之，則以挪威方面與英法挪聯軍交綏爲右翼，以齊格斐防綫與馬奇諾防綫相對壘者爲左翼，越盧森堡與荷蘭，即取荷蘭與比利時爲據點者乃其中路；中路直逼央法兩國之心臟，是不但爲德國主力所在，確可視爲德國全力所趨。故一週前之九閱月，法德兩防綫間之槍相射，砲相轟，飛機相窺伺，斥堠相揪相打，祗是慕前之喜劇，交響之前奏；而今而後，雙方各以其祖宗子孫爲博注，推翻歷史，創造歷史，自此開塲。其四，陸地戰，海上戰，歷史最遠，經騐甚豐，大體可謂彼此知己知彼。至於空中戰，前階段在挪威方面交戰時，雙方有新戰績，德國收新戰果；但其事早在軍事家意想之中，僅於挪威之役，經實地試騐而獲强烈確鑿之證明而已。近二三日，盛傳德國使用「死光」，旣奏宏效，其詳不可得而聞知，德人方面亦翹然自稱曰吾固挾持新武器也。述之較詳者，昨日柏林電稱「防守列日要塞之比利時軍官二人，被德軍俘獲之後，昨已解抵德京；談及德軍所施用之新武器，據謂吾等當時不能使用大砲及機關槍，蓋我等發見我等之槍砲已突然不能放射矣云；海通社記者爰以叩詢之於負責方面，則答稱我等誠有進攻之新武器，但其性質與效用，暫難奉白」；其辭閃鑠，其事迷離，且電自德京，言自德人。夫關科學者，不容意爲信疑；信之必據科學，不信之必據科學，疑之亦必據科學，我人茲絕無所據。苟其事而可信，則屬曠古所未有；我人對於戰局乃至世界大局之前途，將無自而否認其各種容或可能之意外。其五，義大利對於歐戰之態度，吾人迄猶保留近頃迭决所論述之觀察，以爲殆視德國軍事上之進退成敗爲轉移。最近一週間，德軍顯然有局部之進步，局部之成就，故義國態度亦已顯然隨之而作分量相稱之强調。此所謂分量，吾人深憾於相稱云云之外，不克更作具體之說明；然有得從旁烘托其分量之爲何如者：一如華盛頓昨日電稱，美總統羅斯福氏依據至可驚愕之情報，立即再向義相墨索里尼氏呼籲和平；二如美國駐義使領，勸告在義之美國僑民，倘無必要，母事逗留；三如英法駐地中海之艦隊，在義國對岸，即埃及亞歷山大港外，昨日起，開始大規模之聯合演習；四如義大利與美國駐埃及領事，各勸告其留埃僑民，準備隨時離埃；五如瑞士國，位於法德義三國之間者也，最近除動員作軍事措施之外，瑞京日內瓦之國際聯盟會以次之各種國際機關，均作萬一之備；六如東南歐之南斯拉夫國，位於德義之間，感受此項國際旋風甚烈，最近尤動盪震撼，不安萬象；總之，以義大利爲中心，充溢火藥氣息，戰神降臨之前夕不啻也。凡上剖析所得，無非最近一週間逈異往昔之新局勢；其將如何趨歸，吾人不但未欲推論，且願讀者亦僅注視其推移。要知戰爭勝敗確定於最後五分鐘，其中途之現象與聲勢不足取爲論斷之據；而最近將來之事實所將昭吿世人者：德國速戰速決之戰略成或敗也，義國搖曳作熊之終於動或靜也；此而獲得事實之答案，然後研求爾後種種可能之開展，未爲晚也。</p>

<h3>義大利處境的危險</h3>
<p>義大利反英法情緒，近來日見濃厚，各方謠言蜂起，多在猜想該國究將出於何種舉動去援助德國。但是深刻的觀察家仍以爲義大利此時無力從事大規摸戰爭。</p>
<p>義大利雖有軍隊一百萬入，但是軍備的儲藏和軍需原料都感不足。棉花存貨旣屬有限，各種主要金屬品都感缺乏。積存的小麥最多足够一年之用。</p>
<p>煤的問題尤其嚴重。在戰時，義大利每年需煤一千二百萬到一千四百萬噸，在平時，每年也需六百萬到八百萬噸。這些煤，往常由德國和波蘭供給一大部份，由英國供給四分之一左右。因爲輪船的運費比較火車低廉，這些煤多是由海道運輸的。德國方面的來源現在已被英法封鎖所截斷。英國方面的接濟也很困難，一則因爲義國沒有外滙償付貨款，一則因爲英國要求苟無現款，也須以軍備抵付，這層，墨索里尼當然不願開罪德國，輕易予以接受。</p>
<p>德國方面現在尤許每月用火車運煤一百萬噸，接濟義國，每天用六十五列火車，直接從德國三條幹綫，間接由瑞士和南斯拉夫四條鐵路，擔任運輸。這種辦法在理想上雖屬可能，但實際上恐有困難。</p>
<p>義國當局很埋怨英國的封鎖妨害義國取得原料。英國方面則誚並未阻碍義國取得往常所需要的金屬品和他種原料，但不尤義國取得過份的原料，以防接濟德國。此外，義國輪船多被扣留在直布雜陀，在地中海各港口來往的輪船，平時三日可達，現在須稽延至十日之久。義國所需各種原料都須海外運來，這種情形，自然會使義國憤懣異常。</p>
<p>義國的財政很是拮据。開戰以來，人民的生活程度，至少已經提高百分之二十。當局雖曾設法抑低工資，以防通貨膨脹，但已失敗。勞工階級的不滿情緒，即獨裁政府也不能不顧及。義國的工資，已經增加了百分之十六，但仍抵不過生活費的增加。</p>
<p>義國賦稅也很苛重。一九三七年以來，已經增加了三種主要的賦稅，一種是地產稅，一種是股分公司資本稅，一種是普通商店資本稅。最近並且還改徵一種營業稅。獨裁國有民治國所不用的徵稅方法，義國的財政雖已極羅掘的能事，但不能說並無其他開源的方法</p>
<p>義國的中立地位，自己若能嚴格的遵守，他國若能寬大的尊重，該國工商業前途極可樂觀，儘可利用新式工廠設備增加生產，一方面代替交戰國，供給世界市塲，一方面還有餘力，承造交戰各國的定貨，從而調整不利的匯兌。</p>
<p>可是嚴格的說來，義國並非中立國，德國和英法都不願義國獲得利於敵方的任何特權。義國北部的工廠雖忙着製造法國的定貨，但法國祇尤以有限的原料運往義國。義國工廠用他人的原料，製造貨物，立即交出，並無厚利可圖。</p>
<p>義國人力龐大，在二十歲到五十五歲的男子，較法國本國多二百萬人，而兩國的人口却相等。義國自稱能動員八百萬人，但武裝配備必感不敷，即以義國現役一百萬軍隊的配備而論，還嫌不足。去秋墨索里尼更動陸軍將領，就是因爲陸軍配備小足之故。義國在阿比西尼亞與阿爾巴尼亞，均須派駐大軍。其致命弱點，便是阿比西尼亞。假使義國與英法開戰，尙未征服的阿比西尼亞，處於埃及和法屬索瑪里蘭之間，實在有腹背受敵的危險。</p>
<p>羅馬方面的人說墨索里尼親德，實則墨索里尼和一般的義大利人所擁護的是義國，法西斯主義和墨索里尼。墨索里尼與德國勾結的最大原因，諒是他最初相信德義同盟可以保障和平。假如墨索里尼繼續與德勾結，也許是他鑒於德國實力雄厚，預料德國可以戰勝，或者是爲保持自己威望之故。從他方面看來，墨索里尼如果積極參戰，援助德國，那末義國將變成戰塲，償付最高的代價。</p>
<p>義國的工業區集中在北部的米蘭和都林兩地的四週，離法國邊境很近，比較任何强國的工業區更易遭襲擊，這當然是義國工業界百分之九十九竭力反對參戰的一種原因。</p>
<p>但是義國的牽制力却很大。它擁有强大的潛艇隊，足以在地中海使英法大感困難。德國採取攻勢時，義國在西北部邊境的軍隊，縱不出動，至少也能牽制一部份聯軍。義國的控制亞德里亞海，足以阻碍英國的對德封鎖，巴爾幹半島的貨物經亞德里亞海運往德國乃是英國封鎖綫上一大缺口。義國在巴爾幹半島很有勢力，與匈牙利的關係，已臻同盟約程度，儘可經由匈牙利向羅馬尼亞施用壓力。義匈兩國又可共同壓迫南斯拉夫。義國目下正和德國勾結，破壞英法在已爾幹半島的勢力。</p>
<p>總之，義國正處着危險的地位，玩着危險的游戲。北面實力强大的盟國能從陸地向之施用壓力，英法海軍又能在海上向之壓追。十六年，義國的民衆，在國內的改造和國外征略土地的過程中，已經作了巨大犧牲，現已厭倦戰爭祈求和平了。他們曾在本國的大部份從事復興事業，又曾征略阿比西尼亞和阿爾巴尼亞，還爲法西斯主義而在西班牙作戰，現在是需要休養了。（譯紐約HeraldTrlbnne）</p>

<p>江希曾考證的結果、以爲張獻忠由成都敗走川北、是八月十六日事、江藏必是八月十六日以前事、其時、江水正大、非斷流不能穿穴、斷流必開支河、開支河必有大灣、成都附近的道段錦江、凡有大灣有支河的地力、常即江藏所在地了、經時至沿河勘查的結果、確信藏鏹處、必爲望江樓後之沙洲、</p>
<p>楊白鹿自受指示後、即潛心研究、終以世遠年湮、深　萬小一確、不免有多事之譏、故年來均抱緘默、未曾示人、</p>
<p>籌備的經過</p>
<p>抗戰軍興、國庫需款、楊白鹿以時機巳到、遂約同馬昆山師畏、共同發起掘鏹的事、當時，朋友中雖有勸阻者、楊馬兩人、並未爲所動、逕向國民政府呈請備案、邀准開挖、並於呈文中慷慨聲明、「寗可求之勿得、不肯知而不爲、果然發掘成功、所得藏銀、願以百分之八十、貢獻國家」、公司名稱、經政府批准爲錦江淘江公司」、四川省政府並派楊馬兩人爲淘江特派員、</p>
<p>公司備案手續旣辦理完善、乃於二十八年春、由發起人公開招股、最先股份二十股、成立董事會、推定楊白鹿·馬昆山·吳毅候·羅祖南·張協華·幸屬峯·范孔佳·季崇書·文超等丸人爲董事、由楊白鹿担任董事長、馬昆山爲經理、</p>
<p>董事會成立後、接着在望江樓內、設立工程處、聘吳毅候爲經理、楊協華·幸蜀峯·羅祖南·分別担任總務·設計和工程的責任、並聘熊明煊爲總工程師、招工淘掘、三月一日開始探查、施工地點、就在望江樓頭河流止中的沙堆聞、</p>
<p>七種的徵候</p>
<p>三月一日開工後、先在河流正中砂堆間、開始淘掘縱長十丈續寬一丈的方坑、施工五天、深挖丈許、下面就有浸水了、愈深愈大、遂用土法龍骨車四架排水、工作勉强進行、又繼續三日、加工百名、專往下挖、深達一丈八尺、下面仍係砂石泥底、毫無異狀、遂決定加用汽油吸水機排水、同時、又探測多處、三月十二日、從砂堆右邊挖進、距水面四尺左右、發現了無數的枯骨和人頭四具、相隔尺許、料該枯骨等、當非由江水冲來者、據多數專家考查、非近一二百年內的枯骨、顯係張獻忠當日所殺石工及運夫遺骨、這是第一個徵候、</p>
<p>同時、又挖得血浸砂石一層、厚五六寸、面積頗寬、經多數專家硏究、認爲這種血浸砂石、確係人血的浸漬、證以陳韶湘鵑碧綠云、下木石掩蓋、盡殺擊工於其上、又證以婁東沈荀蔚蜀難錄云、「其所聚金銀、以千餘人運之江干、三月始畢、於江底作大穴、投以金銀而殺運夫於其上、後覆以土、仍次江流但故道、依據上述兩叚記載、足以證明血浸砂石、是張獻忠所殺鑒工運夫的血跡、這是第二個徵候、當時、公司方面、以爲上兩種徵候、果係張獻忠殺鑒工運夫的遺骨血跡、其下必有石條、果然、在十三日下午、在血浸砂石和腐朽人骨的下層二尺左右的地方、掘得紅色石條數根、橫江排列、前後左右相接處、都有桐油石灰、用水洗滌、有一塊石頭上刻有張」字、循石進掘、石條陸續出現、均倚右岸排列、頗類人工建設物、經四天的加緊工作、共挖出右條九十二根、多刻有字跡、如「天·司·上·下·一兩」等字樣、又於東方掘得刻有、東字的石條、北面掘有北」字的石條、惟西南」兩字，迄未掘出、因此、可見江藏原有界址一又有一塊石條、上刻有日一字、不能明辯其意、據某學者調、一日」字是張獻忠七殺碑上殺人符號、據蜀龜鎭載獻賊集諸生人與一元寳、令頂於首、入西出東、殺一生、取一寳、回笑曰、『費頭乎、殺爾還是我的』、獻賊嬸戲如小兒、「（一）」即元寳、圈中一劃、即殺人刀也、此爲殺人符號、亦不無理由、</p>
<p>將石條起出、繼續向下深挖、石條下二尺許、又發現桐油石灰和砂石凝結的三合層、將三合層起出、又發現了無數的朽黑水、於此、又得了兩個徵侯、第五個微候、有些神秘了、四月八日夜、工程周圍、突湧現白光、狀似月色、較月色尤爲明亮，的十數分鐘始滅、湧現白光時、監工謝光前、親眼望見、非常驚異、天上無丹，何來月光、光目係一大圈、國外又無光、立刻喚醴司機李忠義起來看、也覺得有些奇怪、同時、車水工人四名、也一同眼息、故光前二小時、掘壕內突然發出河岸崩　的聲響、車夫水夫、都嚇了一跳、趕急拿了燈去看，却沒有什麽損裏、據考古家言、精金內含有寳光外灼、凡窖藏白銀處、必有月色白光發現、假若裏邊沒有金銀寳物、外邊決不能放光沙洲下必有寳藏、這也是一個有趣味而神秘的徽候、</p>
<p>鑒深二丈多、水色黃黑、水氣極臭、類似死屍、同時、在工程右邊、挖出了一隻石牛、睡臥的形式、頭向東北角、重約數千斤、看樣于、當然不是大水冲來的、證以諺云、「石牛對石鼓、銀子萬萬五、有人識得破、買盡成都府」、遂命工人向束北角半頭相對的地方挖掘、果然挖出了一塊石頭、半邊圓形、半邊方形、石之平面、左右凸出而中凹、附近只有這一塊石頭、並沒有其他的東西、但是石鼓爲住麽這種形狀呢、似乎很難斛釋、或者、張獻忠思想離奇、決不循規蹈短、鼓形圓而偏不使之圓、所以造成這種形狀、按照諺歌，旣發現了「石牛對石鼓、銀千萬萬五一、當然在這裏了、這是第六個徵候、　（未完）</p>
<p>敎育消息</p>
<h3>第二屆全國　高級師敎會議記（二）</h3>
<p>— 一德</p>
<p>大學師範院分年獨立設置　實施電影敎育改訂師院課程</p>
<p>院長相繼　報吿校况</p>
<p>主席致詞畢、繼之以各校的報吿、一　流水賬、這裏　乎可以從略了、可惜各師院如何解决他們的困難問題的材料、實在不多、如今寫一些比較不乾枯的問題於下邊吧、（一）西南聯大師院院長黃鈺生謂、（甲）他們的學生眞是來自五方，雲大歸倂的、北大南開流亡來的、與滇敎廳合辦的在職敎員、（二）下年應招收二百四十人、校舍發生問題了、（三）升旗等學生目已來做、（四）學生讀與敎師指定的不吻合、往往取材於生活書店、他們乃選極右的和極左一百種最好的書籍、指導學生課外開讀、（五）敎師名義上有五十人之多、實際上只有二十二人、其餘則來自文理法各院、黃留着鬍鬚像美國敎育家Jndd又像Courtis、聽說他極愛其夫人、夫人現作故、從此留了鬍　、表示不再娶了意、那末專心辦學是毫無疑義了、王理是浙大師院院長、這名字在敎界似乎生疏些、他是繼續鄭宗海的職位的、他們很注意於史地的硏究、特闢史地敎應硏究室、由張其昀總其事、歷史類分通史·國史·鄉土史·傳記·掛圖·地理類爲敎材硏究地理叢書、鄕土地理掛圖、史地是愛國敎育的骨幹、倘能整理得法、有裨國家殊多、</p>
<p>西北師院名義上是獨立了、但尙受西北聯大的牽制、院長李蒸那天說、他們的組織、分（一一敎務處、（二）訓育處、（三）事務處、（四）硏究所、（五）各種委員會、他們女生特多、共計一零八人、佔三分之一、硏究生招不到、只有二個、連助敎參加進去、也不過五個、如果敎育部每年每生有四白元的補助費、或可發達、</p>
<p>中央大學師院前院長艾偉、是忠實的好好先生、辭職後、現由許恪士繼任、許甚熱心、頗有行政能力、他們很注重基本學問、設有國文英文兩委員會、華生不到標準不得事業、（二）打破學生對於公費是應當得的觀念、（三）設置自製標本室、訓練學生製作、出售給中學應用、（四）編寫中學各科敎員手冊、以資輔導、吾國敎育政策也放在裏邊、（五）搜集各地困難與錯誤的材料、以講習會及函授的方式加以改善、</p>
<p>唯一的名副其實的獨立師院院長　茂如、這次因事請假、未能趕到、於是女師院籌備主任謝循初做了殿軍、這個女師院下　即可招生開學、地點不出四川、擬設六系一科、即文史茶·英語系·家事系·敎育系·數學系音樂系和備育科、籌倫會迄今尙未開過、而今齊國樑和陶玄都在渝了、日內即可召集會譏、將來院長自然是謝循初、他現任敎育部委員、</p>
<p>陳敎部長　答復問題</p>
<p>各師院報吿完畢、陳數部長又補充的答復了若干問題、（一）關於師院獨立設置、敎育部預定逐漸轉到獨立的式子上、湖南、西北已達到了獨立、今辦的女師院亦可獨立、其他希望能獨立的、但經費如何、請各位要預算一下、究竞將多出若千錢、又如師資怎樣準備、可吾先行獨立一部分，諸如此類的問題、天家不妨先行加以研討、（二）各師院的設備費，已請行政院特別想法、將來當爲師院另撥款項、現在有許多事不能不做、若一說經費便不能做、只有先做再想法子、這種辦法吃虧的地方也不免、可是事業是開展了、各位堅苦、大家深悉、今日惟有兩全之法、才能建國、一是事業進行、二是要合理想、（三）師院的實騐研究冉也重要不過了、師院實騐室等於工廠、不能不有、不過在這時期、確也有困難處、常在驚報聲中、就不易辦了、學校一遷、動輒八萵十萬、（四）師院數量問題、目前可謂已够、東·南·西·北·西北·西南·中央應有九所、再加女師院、也得要十個、今有六所、連女師院共七所、可以應付了、將來第二步也許每省設一師院的、（五）師院研究的對象、各地不同、擇當地的缺點加以硏究、推行實施、因時因地制宜、例如浙江一省、浙東浙西便大不同、居民個性亦異、所以師院宜各異其硏究、把各師院硏究的結果、集合起來、就可成國家很完整的硏究室、</p>
<p>委座在國民敎育會議、提倡生產勞動、學校自己種植、自己牧畜、將吃下的餘剩物排洩的糞便、作廢物利用、何樂不爲呢、委座又倡仁愛、同情的發揮、力戒虐待牲畜、毀損花木、第三件事情是史地問題、民族的養成、多賴乎史地敎育，愛國要從內心上發出、覺得國家之可愛、萬萬不可毀損牠一點兒、由歷史中發揮民族意識、由地理中發揮民生觀念、如果史地公民三科敎得好、三民主義不講也可以、這三種學科是愛國的基礎、現化生物是造成現代化國家的基礎、再加上國文數學，便可發展上述的六種科目了、</p>
<p>我們老祖宗自有道理、他們倡禮樂射御書數要聯繫的敎、成爲整個的、惠爾司謂、今日的敎育如地震後坍塌下的房子、徒見得殘片斷瓦、一堆堆的洋灰零星物件、看不出全部的房屋、其弊就在敎育分片的敎導、今日應急起聯繫起來、分則爲塊、合則成套、若各師院担任一種硏究、其他師院帮他硏究、將來把各處研究的聯合起來、才可適合時代要求、打破歷史困難、</p>
<p>分組審查　部長設宴</p>
<p>四月二十六日、是會議的第二天、整天的分組審查、計分二組、第一組爲行政及一般問題、第二組係課程及訓育、是日天陰雨警報全艦、大安心的完了工作、晚上陳部長設宴、並開座談會、賓主盡觀、</p>

<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤、暴跌後重見靑天市面、恍惚易受反饗、致上落龐大、最高最低幾達一千元之巨、可謂驚人矣、晨初因人心受隔昨之刺激、再以匯市報長、極度不安而吿在撳至五千四百元開盤、且賣戶竟有照價自願抑低二十元脫手、嗣錢兌業力塞重壓、又見五千三百元低盤、豈知十一時後、惰勢遽變、蓋美國加入歐戰尙未至時期、乃匯市轉緊、賣風頓杳、扒者驟起、證券幫金號銀號俱購、需時巳跳達六千一百元、雖未幾錢兌業乘高力售、一度退入六千元關內、但午收仍升爲六千一百四十元、後市外滙緊勢愈俏、證券幫等加碼猛進、並產生不少新多搜購、價曾漲達六千二百五十元頂盤，後金號作當日獲利了結吐賣、中復回低至六千元關上、而收盤前六千二百三十元高價突再出現、惟結果傳意大利參戰、某金號於收盤時傾塞、跌爲六千〇八十元收盤、較上日軋漲五十元、聞塲外趨勢極疲、六千元尙乏貿主、全天交易暢旺、約五千兩光景、銀樓飾金漲落無定、終則好起十元、海關金等仍平、</p>
<p>烚赤上落幾近千元</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）、初以外滙奇鬆、人心極形萎疲、未開時一片喊照開盤價賣出、而電無一受主、其中賣戶遂又願照開盤價再低一二十元沽出、可見人心恐惶已達極點，延九時半開時、首由金號出銀樓幫十兩、祇吿五千四百元、比上日猛撳六百三十元之多、嗣因某錢兌業力塞數十兩、續又在跌百元、錢兌業出散戶共三十兩、遜爲五千三百元、旋乃證券幫見機收買、而銀號幫金號等亦跟蹤競購、且匯市忽又回緊、一時市面轉昂、不久回升八百元、銀號對做三十兩、爲六千一百元、後買風稍戰、另一證券幫及錢兌業哇出、而散戶多頭亦獲利脫手、復猛撳二百五十元、十一時許因外匯依然吿緊、買風復熾銀號幫錢兌業等競扒、重又回漲三百元、銀號出金號二十兩、對六千一百五十元、繼而銀號對做十兩、爲六千一百四十元　午收價、午後開時、外匯報緊，激動買風、銀號進金號十兩爲六千二百元、後因證券幫及錢兌業力進、再好五十元、銀號出證券幫二十兩、爲六千二百五十元、旋乃金號幫忽來競相　出、而外匯斯時亦吿一轉便、頓回落二百五十元、銀號對做十兩、爲六千元、後以證券幫再來狂吸、拖人有數、銀號亦轉賣爲實、重父飛漲二百三十元、金號出證券幫二十兩、爲六千二百三十元、不意其時市上突有意　利參戰之說、某金號多頭傾向出籠、竟再反空數百兩、不久頓　小二百元、證券幫出銀號三十兩、為六千〇三十元、將近收盤時、賣風稍殺、再又步漲五十元、證券幫出銀號廿兩、爲六千〇八十元、作晚收價、結果比上日軋漲五十元、收後銀號力賣、照晚收價低三四十元、竟有三百餘兩成交、全天計九百五十元上落、現金號之本牌金售出價、照烚赤較高十元、收進减低三十元、現標金照掛牌金低五十餘元、均鮮做開、</p>
<p>飾金變動有十三次</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出價、亦暴跌後突見飛漲、大同行與新同行於晨九點半郞掛小五十元、退至五百五十元、九點三刻至十點三刻步升四次、共漲五十元途六百元、十一點左右回小至五百九十元、十一點十分至十二點又步升三次漲四十元、達六百三十元、下午二點十五分退全六百十元、二點半至三點二十五分復升二十元至六百三十元、四點正復小七元、爲六百二十元（收進减四十元）、一日有十三次變動、軋升二十元云，</p>
<h3>外幣跌後轉穩</h3>
<p>昨日外幣市况、英美金鎊始隨金價繼續暴落、後以金價急遽轉漲、故亦隨之回平英金票以黑市英滙鬆後轉緊、故亦先跌而後漲、美金栗晨初續跌至十七元、嗣以黑市美匯　蘭轉緊，近午高至十九元三角、午後又退爲十八元六角、但比上日仍漲六角、香港票始隨港滬匯兌大跌、繼而步趨漲勢、但結果仍稍疲軟、法郞票供給未减、市價仍軟、羅比、及坎拿大·菲列濱票等、均稍有需要、市價略漲、日余票供給激减、市價遽兩回漲、晚市高爲一元一角五分、朝鮮票仍不乏供給、晚市爲九角、</p>
<h3>英印銀價狂長</h3>

<h3>證券　內債了結為多　外股賣風難止</h3>
<p>證券暗盤、昨日市况、變動甚爲激烈、午前續續上翔、午後忽父劇跌、起伏無定、仍係　日公債走勢之慣例、蓋初以謠言美因援助英法、擬實行金元貶值、為迅速有利的經濟協助、外滙猛長、金子狂跌、各項物價無小慘落、公債處於有利地位、繼續上騰、但美元貶値、尙非旦夕可以實行、多方旋因金子狂漲而出臨、慘跌甚厲、仍未脫從前大小盤旋之窩臼、總之在銀根甚緊、拆息過高時、此種非公債切膚之好消息、尙未能培養其根本堅實、但此種當漸漸趨於佳境、不過時日問題耳、昨日買賣各戶、大都希圖了結、新交易甚少、上午放空比補空爲多、市價先高後小、丙種曾見五十元七角高價、午後多方紛紛了結、市價大瀉甲種頓破入六十元關、丙種亦破入五十元關、跌落甚鉅、入後因同順久　鴻康益昌等補空、稍見回上一二角、結果反比隔日小四角至八角半、成交總數約爲一百二十萬元右左、茲列簡明表於後、</p>

<p>衆業公所報吿云、紐約股市雖已止跌、本埠股市開盤平穩、後賣風漸盛、市况又轉虛軟、但此番風浪、歷時不長、因買戶激增、價格反動猛烈回升、午收趨勢價堅、下午開盤、始亦甚佳、繼因又有賣戶、乘高出節、致晚收價校最高時略低、此後市况、然仍將爲歐戰消息所左右、苟聯軍方面戰事順利、人心激昂、價格趨漲、自不待言、皮之則徒與賣方活動機曾、因市况動盪殊烈、欲舉一日中之龐大交易、加以縷析、洵非易事、但有一點、値得注意者、即荷屬東印各橡皮公司股、趨勢迄今仍甚虛軟、此無疑爲一般人對於該項屬地未來命運、甚覺不安，因納粹之德國、頃已事實上控制荷蘭全境也、</p>

<p>滬埠外棉交易、因海外棉市之低落、匯兌鬆長、折合棉價殊廉、然因歐洲戰事日漸擴大、運輸益覺困難、且危險性之巨大、故毫無成交、但滬上存底微薄、同業不願廉售故現貨價格始終高昂異常、聞天津幫又將採麟說，各同業父見活躍、茲將海外棉市以美匯五元一二五折合期貨送廠價如下、</p>

<h3>歐戰擴大後　上海外僑之波動　美國尚未至參戰時期　本埠與荷印照常貿易</h3>
<p>歐戰形勢、日益擴張、風雲變幻之勢、反映於此遠東最大都市之上海者、亦復波翻浪湧、如響斯應、英法德各國當局現正因歐戰之愈趨激烈、而在　展開其宜傳之白刃戰、聞英國駐華情報處、將發刋午報一種、其印刷事宜、委託字林西報辦理、以與德國方面在滬每日發行之「午報」相對抗、而英法荷比德僑民間之敵對行爲、亦隨戰局發展而逐漸明顯、</p>
<p>美領力闢各方謠言</p>
<p>日來市塲方面、散播謠言頗盛、尤以盛傳美國將參加歐戰、影響金融市塲最大、茲據接近美外交界外人消息、美國目前斷不至於參加任何戰事、但對於防衛凖備、絕不稍懈、如國家生存受威脅、領土被侵略時、則不惜出於一戰、本埠美僑對於上項謠言、均表示詫異、蓋彼等均未接到領事署任何通知、有向領事署詢及該事者、經領署聲明、外傳一切、均不可靠、如届時情形緊張、自當以最有效之方法、通知各僑準備撤退、但目前並無此項需要、至於香港情形緊張、亦屬虛　、蓋該處美僑、亦未凖備撤退也、</p>
<p>荷印貿易必要措置</p>
<p>據外人方面消息、荷印與上海間之貿易、業已恢復原狀、荷駐滬總領波塞凡氏、並已定於今日與最近飛抵上海之該國駐平公使館參贊費利斯氏、進行協議、採取各種必要措施、以自德軍侵人荷蘭後、荷印與上海貿易曾一度中止、因之荷幣匯價、混亂不堪、此後、決設一統制滙價機關、規定荷幣之法定價値、俾使荷印與上海間貿易、恢復其原有狀態、</p>
<p>租界地位決無變動</p>
<p>上海爲通商巨埠、於歐洲戰局、頗多貿易上之關係、記者以義大利如因歐局變化而與德軍聯肩作戰、是否將有任何影響於公共租界問題、詢諸關係方面、據新聲社記者向可靠方面探息、苟義大利參與歐戰、上海係公共租界、雖租界內駐有義軍、然係防護性質、故公共租界地位、決無變動、必仍可維持原狀、</p>
<p>義大使仍滯留上海</p>
<p>義在滬官員大使馬邱、刻仍滯滬、現寓祁齊路私邸、義駐滬總領事館、照常工作、義方官員、態度沉默異常、不欲表示任何意見駐滬防軍、雖有一部、但純係護僑性質、刻駐防滬西勞勃生路一帶、泊滬之義艦、現亦僅有」卡洛吐號」砲艦一艘、停泊於浦東十六號浮简、</p>
<p>德情報員所作談話</p>
<p>德國駐滬大使　情報專員柯德、於昨日在招待新聞記者席上、發表如下之談話、略云、「今日所謂神經戰、現已進入武力戰矣、惟今日所作之預測、每每不能適合於翌日之事變、歐洲情勢、瞬息萬變、是以欲推測下一小時將有何種局面出現、誠憂乎其難、夫民治國家之政策、輒決定於各種團體之議論、而德國每有政策之決定、均在於一分鐘之間、政策旣經決定、則下一分鐘即可實施行動、此種政治制度之優點、惟德國能施行之、</p>
<p>猶人反德空氣濃厚</p>
<p>上月會有居住法租界之德僑五名、因有反英法嫌疑而被限令遷出、乃最近猶人之反德空氣、亦見濃厚、據昨日可靠方面消息、居住於沙遜大厦之三德人、即機械商皮克·藥料商克勞斯·律師摩拉、昨日亦接獲通知、須於本月底前遷出、同時沙遷大廈經租處亦接獲此項通知、據共中某一德人稱、此舉顯然含有政治作用、據摩拉稱、彼等是否可在他處覓得住處一問題、沙遜大厦經租處、未肯予以答覆、渠稱、渠等與沙遜大厦經租處之感情、向極友好、接獲遷居通知則爲最近之事、關於此事、沙遜大厦業主亦不肯發表意見、至於是否係因本埠猶人與德人利益上之衝突、亦無法證實、前途如何、殊堪注意、</p>
<p>荷僑會議決定態度</p>
<p>大陸報云、本市荷聞僑民、昨日（十五日）驟聞荷軍已向德軍投降消息、頗爲震驚、乃將昨日午後十二時三十分在上海總會舉行之週宴、改成會議、嚴重討論荷蘭遭遇挫折之可能後果、席間通過決議案、內有無論後事如何、本市荷僑事務、仍將照常進行等語、同時渣華輪船公司亦宣布荷軍投降、不致影響遠東之荷船航期、</p>
<p>駐滬荷領嚴正表示</p>
<p>駐滬荷總領事鮑賽文昨吿記者稱、渠尙未接荷政府發來荷軍已投降之正式消息、一俟此訊經官方證實、則本市荷僑或將採取特殊步驟、飽氏並切言、荷蘭王國乃許多部份所組成、政府雖已從他國、惟荷屬東印度·西印度·及其他殖民地·曁荷蘭僑民、則照舊進行一切云、</p>
<p>渣華各輸照常航行</p>
<p>據渣華輪船公司方面聲稱、遠東荷船、皆將繼續照常行駛、不致有何延宕情事、且荷商輪船公司在本市報端所刊廣告、數週前暫停者、現已恢復刋載、可見「此間各事已復常態、」關於行駛荷屬東印度及美國熱那亞間之荷船、未獲最近消息、但信該綫之定期航行、當予維持、苟地中海局勢不安全、則該綫各荷船或將改道好望角、然後駛往葡萄牙、或直接駛英、惟此路綫旣長而且危險、</p>
<p>大批荷糖運抵上海</p>
<p>荷商渣華郵船公司之芝紗丹尼號，業於昨日到滬、停泊於藍烟囱碼頭、積極卸貸、至於芝尼加拿號、亦定於二十日到滬、今以貨物關係、須改於二十一日抵滬、該兩輪駛滬曾在爪哇方面裝載荷蘭產組砂糖甚多、巳到之輪、現正紛忙於卸貨工作、兩輪運來荷糖、約計達萬餘包、</p>
<p>比國紅會呼籲捐助</p>
<p>中比邦交、素極敦陸、一二八之役、在華比僑、捐輸中國難民、爲數甚鉅、八一三後、在滬南市晏海路特創慈安產科醫院、兼施藥品、徐家匯同仁街、復牧慈惠醫院、難胞獲救、爲數甚衆、至今深感、此次比國不幸、亦遭戰禍、駐華比大使紀佑穆侯爵夫人、在滬組織比國紅十字會、救濟其本國難民、尙望我國人士、本人類互助之義務、踴躍輸將、收款處本埠外灘華比銀行或辣斐德路一三〇〇號比國領事公館、</p>
<h3>洋米進口　准予免稅　商民自黨外幣購運　省府監督平價銷售</h3>
<p>財政部爲增裕來源、救濟民食起見、已規定靑黃不接時期、洋米進口免稅辦法三項、電令各地海關遵照實行、茲將該辦法照錄如下，（一）洋米進口准予豁免關稅、（二）洋米由商民自籌外幣購運、由省政府監督平價銷售，（三）洋米免征關稅、暫以本年五六七八四個月進口者爲限、</p>
<h3>救世軍籌解決　乞丐問題　儼然成一集團　救濟頗費周章</h3>
<p>救世軍領袖毛立斯談截至本月底爲止、本埠卅五收容所難民約萬人、將全數加以遣散、一俟遣散工作辦理完竣、救世軍即將轉移目標、以從事乞丐問題之救濟救世軍方面對此事、已加續密考慮、或將成立一種新組織、以收容乞丐、惟預算經費當極繁多、成立後之經常維持費用、尤屬可觀、籌措亦必須大費周章也、本埠乞丐、爲數當在五千人之譜、其中大半、甚有以求乞討爲職業者、且受乞丐頭目指揮結幫成羣、儼然成一集團、而由丐首收取入團費、欲解决乞丐問題、此種特殊情形、實爲一大困難、而須設法加以解決者、</p>
<h3>法公董局六厘公債　定本月底攤還</h3>
<p>法公董局所發出之一九一一年六厘公債、尙餘有票面銀三萬三千兩之債券流通在外、公董局按分期攤還表之規定、定五月卅一日發還、又該局一九二三年及一九三六年六厘公債、已定五月十五日至三十一日停止過戶、</p>
<h3>工部局核准提高　自來水附加費　提高至百分之一百十　預算書根據滙價編訂</h3>
<p>上海自來水公司鑒於物價飛漲、各項開支激增、爰於上月間、檢附本年度修正預算書、呈請工部局、准自六月一日起、將現行自來水附加實百分之五十、提高至百分之一百十、上項預算書、係根據滙價英金四辨士曁美金六分折合國幣一元而編訂、說明各項開支、因增發薪給以及物品漲價而增出之情形、尤以燃料與電力兩項為最、上年</p>
<p>用水數量</p>
<p>雖比前年為多、但本年預計不致增加、而物價則有繼續高漲之可能、於是薪給等等、勢將重行調整、按照現行水費　附加費徵收率之收入、除去開支以後、所餘之數、如以發給依照定章所應付之金鎊股　虧短甚鉅、此事公司方面取為顧慮、此次申謂附加費</p>
<p>提高動機</p>
<p>實基於斯、以期本年收人項下、得能產生餘數一項、足以應付前項股息之支出、在現狀之下、如欲編製一相當正確之預算書、實不可能、前項預算書、係就經騐所得而編訂、所列各項開支均屬最低限度、無伸縮之　地、因此必須設法增裕收入、將來開支方面增出之數額、本月七日、該公司復以書面補充說明此次請求一節、係以滙價四辨士及實行加價之期假定不過五月底爲根據、最近滙率又趨低落、上項請求、倘非如期實行、則所擬增收之數、仍感不敷勢須另行編造補充預算書、請求在短時期內、</p>
<p>再度加價</p>
<p>案經工部局公用事業委員會於本月九日首次會議、提出慎重討論、並詳細硏突公司情形、結果　爲所稱各節、尙屬合理、應准照辦、但實行之期、改自用水期在本年六月十七日或十七日以後終止之時開始、同時此事在本年十一月底以前、得由局方重行</p>
<p>隨時考慮</p>
<p>一面請由該公司派員與局方代表、就公司按照定章所應付之金鎊股息方面，進行商討、以期减輕用戶之負擔、以上各項建議、均經該局董事會本月十五日例會通過、又該委員會開會時、委員米契爾被推爲該會主席、</p>
<h3>酒菜業等　照常繳納難捐</h3>
<p>本市酒菜業以及娛樂業之雞民捐、爲數甚鉅、如僅酒菜一業、每月所繳付難民協會老、即在三萬五千元左右、近更增至約四萬元、惟通來因難民協會爲减少公衆負祖、各收容所難民、除殘廢老弱寡婦孤兒外、均一律限於本月卅一日前解散、因之、一向繳納難民捐之各業、對於此後難民捐是否賡續如數繳納、均表懷疑、平明社記者特向難民協會探訪、據稱難胞解散後、各業難民捐仍照常收納、蓋邇因物價奇昂、該會開支浩大、經費並不見充裕、</p>

<h3>抑低物價法令　已屆執行時機　市場現貸充斥銷售無門　外滙放鬆成本當然減輕</h3>
<p>字林西報載讀者來函稱、本月二日、法幣從四便士二五縮至三便士二五、上海百物價格、乃在數小時內突漲四分之一、其後法幣濱値激增、幾回升二分之一、然商店未有减低其物價者、當軸近發通吿、謂對「非法牟利者決當起訴」、此項通吿、茍具價値、則今有予以證明之機會矣、前此物價騰貴、情勢使然、無人加以反對、惟我人今要求當軸立取抑低之步驟、苟不出此、則任何藉口俱無理由、商人有不尤减低物價者、當視同非法牟利、加以懲罰、</p>
<p>煤價續降</p>
<p>公共租界工部局鋻於黃金價格　瀉、各煤球廠成本减輕、故該局業已通知各該煤球廠商、切實將煤球售價迅行抑低、俾輕平民負擔、聞各廠自接通知後、決將會同集議、運照辦理、煤業市塲昨日下午一時開市後、人心繼續看小、各大戶煤公司紛將棧貨開價脫售、除他貨形成盤旋局勢外、結果鴻基塊煤續小十一元一噸、現同業批價已回降至二百十六元、並因客帮無意再吸，以致市塲成交不夥、昨據某煤業委員談稱、歐洲戰局雖告擴天、惟煤觔來源、可無問題、况滬市存煤亦甚充實、</p>
<p>米市疲憊</p>
<p>米市場買賣昨日仍一蹶不振、繼前日疲風、降落一元或二元不等、惟賣者倍增、買者匿跡、一時現貨充斥、似告鮮人問津、雜糧油餅業交易混紊、各貨一律做小、人心惶然、不可終日、米業鉅子語大中社記者、以後米市、尙須看跌、蓋滬上存底、迄今懂棧存一項已增至一百五十萬包、而由水陸兩路到滬國米、日必二三千包、其最大原因、爲蕪湖米聞已開禁、日軍已准許行商前柱採購、以目下本市人口計算、即專恃存底、亦可維持半年之久、本市第四期平糶、現仍在募集經費中、聞已募得款項達六十萬元、但不敷尙鉅、甚望各界踴躍輸捐、因照第三期平糶辦法、以四十八家米號二十日之平糶時期、則需款約在一百五十萬元也、</p>
<p>華董意見</p>
<p>據華董虞洽卿氏稱、滙長金跌、物價亦應减低、但一般廠商、依然高價出售、誠屬費解、以煤斤而論、前次漲價之理由、係藉口金價高漲、而目前之金價　回復、如匯市變化前之價格、則各種煤價、自亦應回復如初、而煤球十日三漲之價格、更應回復原定之價格、於各廠商亦有裨益、林康侯亦謂正當之工商業、其售價視成本而定，方爲正當、乃隨外匯、難稱正當、因一經上漲、不隨美金之下落而即减價也、至於如電力·如電車·如自來水·如公共汽車、實爲公用事業、原以公共利益爲重、而予以專利、實非自由競爭之營利事業可比、則自應一方面顧及公衆之負擔、同時兼顧及公用事業之持久、乃其價格之上漲、亦隨美金之匯價以爲變化、一若上海市塲通貨已變爲盧金本位、惟望市政當局、盡其力所能及、爲最大多數利益着想、庶公共安寗、得以確保、</p>
<h3>日威脅外輪　自圓其說</h3>
<p>字林西報云、日海軍發言人昨日（十五日）證實報載本市日當局已請上海與溫州間之外船合作而服從日艦之條規一說、該發言人在招待新聞記者席上答覆某記者稱、日海軍於四月二十六日託日總領署通知本市領事團、轉請外國船隻服從已定之手續、日當局所以發此通知者、乃因溫州附近已發現胃懸外國旗幟之船隻、夜間不燃燈火而出入溫州港口、日方極難辨別、究屬華方船隻、抑係第三國船隻、迄今爲止、並無外船被扣禁情事、</p>
<h3>黃金回漲無力　黑匯趨勢仍鬆　中國法幣價值實際提高　「聯銀券」與日圓均慘跌</h3>
<p>本月初黃金在跌猛漲、黑匯猛縮之波濤過後、僅隔旬日、於十四日起、反呈在跌猛鬆、至昨日情形、黃金仍回漲無力、黑匯亦欲縮無能、惟起伏不定、上落甚鉅、平明社記者以黃金在瀉、黑匯奇鬆一事、對於華方金融上之關係及日方有無套匯情事、向銀行界權威某君探詢、據稱、此次金價在跌、黑滙猛鬆、對於中國金融上益趨有利、其關係情形如下、（一）傳外香港平準基金委員會、對於上海黑市外滙，已於日前停止供給、但此係投機者所放之謠言、但上海黑匯起落、與中國整個金融政策、絕無影響、（二）中日戰局、華方迭决吿捷、必能獲得最後勝利之把握、愈益顯明、故法幣價値、無形提高、亦爲此次滙市鬆長中原因之一種、（三）歐戰擴大以後、外貨進口益將减少、土貨出口、則需要更大、此與華方金融上、殊爲有利、</p>
<p>日方已無餘力套滙</p>
<p>（四）日方在淪陷區內、所搜攫之法略、其中以江海關稅收爲最鉅、但日方於以前累次套滙時及其他用途時耗去、所餘無幾、且感捉襟見肘之苦、於此次黑匯鬆長中、並無餘資可供套滙、是以日方已無利可圖、在最近三中、並無有日方鉅額套匯情事發見云、又據昨日法文上海日報載稱、據香港傳來消息、平準委員會又有增加二百五十萬鎊基金之訊、若然、則法幣兌價、當愈有看高之勢、</p>
<p>現金黑滙昨日市况</p>
<p>昨晨初黃金仍猛烈下跌、晨開五千四百元、繼即爲五千三百元、與前日收盤相較、傾瀉又達七百三十元之鉅、但至午則又步步回漲、又出六千元大關、爲穴千一百四十元、至午後入盤旋狀態、起伏不定、但一般情形、尙稱平靜、至晚收盤爲六千零八十元、至於黑滙最鬆英匯達三便士九三七五、美匯至五元六八七五、但至晚收盤時、英滙仍爲二便士九三七五、美匯爲五元三一二五、</p>
<p>日圓集團已趨崩潰</p>
<p>日本在僞「滿一及華北之日圓集團、其目的在便利日本對華之輸出輸入、可盡量吸收中國之資源、無如「聯銀券」價格日趨慘落、日圓價格、亦隨之低落、昨日爲一元一角五分、據日文報紙昨日之記載、僞滿以「聯銀券」流人總數約三四百萬、仍爲妨害當地金融、業已決定限令於六月十五日以前、將僞「滿」境內之「聯銀券」全部予以肅淸、同時華北亦公佈限制日圓系通貨之流通、足證日圓集團、憶趨崩潰矣、</p>
<h3>工務處工人罷工　籌商處置辦法　馬路垃圾堆積如山市民不便　無賴乘機搗亂強迫停市</h3>
<p>關於工部局工務處工人罷工一事、昨（十六）日曾由該局總辦兼總裁工務處長賢警務處長會同商討適當處理辦法、以期工潮早日解決、昨各馬路垃圾堆積如山於交通衛生兩有妨碍、市民頗感不便、</p>
<p>木工條件</p>
<p>工程修理部木工要求條件如下、（一）每逢例假星期日、中外年節冬至節工資照給、（二）休假日如不停工、應以雙工付給、每人最低工資每日二元、其他鐵工銅工機器工人要求、亦大致相同、</p>
<p>虹口響應</p>

<p>擒獲一匪供出主犯</p>
<p>兩匪等覺已失風、遂開啟房鬥、一匪持偽手槍者、向盤梯上飛逸而下、由後門遁去、卒被兎脫、餘一匪倉皇圍逃，誤闖入八二五號房間躱避、其時各工友均聞警雲集，有一工友名高龍其者，（海門人二十七歲服役七年）奮不顧身，將八二五號房內一匪擒獲、同時下層管理員焦世淸、亦已聞警、一面通報捕房、一面下令將前後門禁閉、阻止出人、幷指揮各工友四處搜索匪踪、於八時五十分許、捕房警務人員分乘警備車趕到、始將拘獲之一匪帶入捕房、據該匪徒在捕房供稱、渠等係受該寓客之兩子唆使、擬刦奪其父所有、並曾約定事後在白爾部路裕恒里三十三號報吿刦後情形、捕房據供後、立即派員在該處守候、果將該寓客之兩子捕獲、經兩相對質之後、兩子俯首承認、</p>

<h3>蕭湜被綁案　內幕情形複雜　蕭已出險率眷赴港　司閽捕有勾串行為　判罪不報上訴審結</h3>
<p>滬西好萊塢賭窟主腦粵人梁某之同鄕蕭提、於去年十二月八日晚間八時五十分、遭匪據去、出事後十分鐘、蕭所居膠州路一百四十八弄之司閣巡捕皖人王錦山、即自蕭家用電話報吿該管靜安寺捕房、謂有</p>
<p>綁匪兩名</p>
<p>步入該弄之後、各執手槍、首將渠嚇禁聲張、威　彼面墻　、並解除彼之武裝、始至該弄十一號蕭家、將蕭湜架出弄外挾登預停之汽車、疾馳而逸、惟彼被匪奪去之手槍一枝、則由匪　於蕭之家鬥口、　經檢回、該捕旋復親投捕房詳述前情、當經捕頭遴派中西探目馳往蕭家詢明蕭確被綁無踪、但訪問四鄰却均</p>
<p>未能證實</p>
<p>被架時之情狀、更無有目覩之者、及一再向王錦山究詰、王又稱、兩匪中之一、係蕭家庖丁、與渠相識、曾對渠言、因被主人薄待、且將辭退、故欲據之勒贖、得資願與渠分云云、捕頭以該司閣實有幫同綁票嫌疑、立予扣押、飭探嚴緝綁匪、營救肉票、俾明眞相、詛中西幹探方在上緊跴緝間、忽好萊塢梁某聲請、</p>
<p>茍緩追究</p>
<p>則蕭猶可安全、不然將於事主不利嗣於本年一月二十日、捕房查悉蕭已赴港、未幾、其卷屬亦相繼離滬、故對於蕭被綁經過、及贖出情形、費款若干、迄尙不明眞相、惟以王錦山幫助據人勒贖、情節顯然、依法提起公訴、由第一特區地方法院初審終結、判處有期徒刑三年半、該犯不甘服罪、具狀上訴、昨日下午三時、復山高二分院刑庭長問翰特開合議庭</p>
<p>票提王犯</p>
<p>到案研訊、王仍否認參加綁票、並由范剛律師爲之辯護、指捕房不能提出足以證明王錦山幫助犯罪之確切證據、且稱王若果已分得贖款、何以其家屬依然貧窮、敝律師屢爲出庭、而公費尙分文未得等語、但捕房律師甘鏡先與蒞庭之檢察官皆依據調查所得之事實、參以王犯之自白、認定王所佩之手槍、並非被匪刦奪、而係王於事前</p>
<p>自借與匪</p>
<p>毫無疑義、要求裁判長駁回上訴、遂由周庭長宣吿辯論終結、定期宣判、王錦山仍飭解回靜安寺捕房覊押、該犯之老母妻兒、昨均詣法庭旁聽、及審結退出庭外、彼等心理似慮上訴殊沙希望、相對愈形黯然、</p>
<h3>逆倫弒父案　上訴判決書（續昨）</h3>
<p>該被吿等無心神錯亂及失去指南力之精神疾病」、更證以本院直接審理之所得、該上訴人等不特思想淸晰供述有條不紊、且力圖翻供卸减罪責、較常人尤覺狡黠、均足爲心神健全、毫無耗弱象徵之認定、况上訴人等均各聲稱並無精神喪失或耗弱病症、而周欽吉更堅稱『上訴理山狀所載、我</p>
<p>有精神病</p>
<p>故是不贊成的我祇有身體衰弱之病症、」是上訴理由狀中、關於心神耗弱之辯解、或爲上訴人等向其辯護人轉述身體衰弱之誤會、尤無再加審究之必要、至於上訴人等共同謀殺生父之原因、據其母周經氏·其姊周欽珠·及其表兄陳人駿·姨母陳經氏等之供述、並參酌上訢人等之自白、願由於周永杰</p>
<p>個性刻薄</p>
<p>吝齋、與其妻周經氏失和多年、不無時加凌虐之處、因憎母愛惡其子、不特使上訴人等靑年輟學、且忿署漫駡、視爲故常甚至父子間經年不交一語、馴至天性之親汨沒殆盡、而仇怨恨毒之念、與日俱進、終乃潰禮敎之大防、釀成家庭間之慘劇、尙與圖謀家產無直接之關係、唯查我國教崇禮敎首重孝、第弒父大逆</p>
<p>比諸梟獍</p>
<p>故除父有汚穢失德情形、卑幼激於義憤者外、實屬極惡大慈毫無矜全之餘地（參照二十四年第五九八二號部令）、况縱如上訴人等所述、周永杰在生對其妻之虐待僅爲刻薄寡恩、對共子之憎惡、亦止於輟學謾駡、上訴人等苟欲委曲求全、何患無方、詛忍</p>
<p>遽萌殺念</p>
<p>顧乃詳思熟慮，一再預謀、竟悍然利用科學上電流殺人方法、慘斃生父、並不惜支解拆割毀屍滅跡、以繼其後、觀其處心之險毒、殺　之堅決、手段之慘忍、態度之兇惡、均足證明其天理民彝、已殘賊無餘、若小</p>
<p>處以極刑</p>
<p>將何以維禮敎而固邦本、原判決依刑法第二十八條第二百七十二條第一項第二百四十七條第一項（漏褐明同法第二百五十條）第五十五條第三十六條第三十七條第一項第三十八條第一項第二款酌處周欽吉周欽祥各死刑、各褫奪公權終身、倂將供犯罪所用之鐵剪鋸刀電綫繼索寺件沒收、尙無不當、周欽吉周欽祥（未完）</p>

<h3>前日的投機市場</h3>
<p>— 或人</p>
<p>前天的投機市塲中，因外滙於長，烚赤暴縮，騷然之狀，不可言喩。那些唯恐天下不亂，在混水中游泳的人們，昨天晚上大概也都在失眠狀態之中；即或闔眼，也一定被惡夢所驚醒。</p>
<p>本來，「孤島」市面的混亂，與物價的在漲，受外來壓迫者少，而爲投機操縱者多。試看每次變動，都是投機市塲掀風作浪所致。昨天的情形，也是他們罪有應得。所可憐的是一批盲從之徒，也跟着傾覆在混水的深處，甚至發生更悲慘的結局。</p>
<p>這一批人可分爲三大類：一是生活不易，想到投機市塲中繳碰運氣；是誤信法幣不値錢謠言，莫明其妙地「扒」一陣；一是活動活動，譬如賭銅錢。這三類中，第一類當然是最可憐的，生活旣已不易，那里有本錢去「投機」？運氣未來，霉氣却輪個正着！第二種其愚可憫，其心可誅！如果法幣眞是一錢不値，手中這一點「積蓄」仍然有甚麼用處？第三種以爲投機較賭錢爲刺激，勝負非所計也。但是無論其本意如何，目的何在，總之，她們帮助了「漁翁」多造謠言的機會，而間接使全市市民吃着犬虧。</p>
<p>所以，碰碰運氣是此路不通的！誤信法幣不値錢的，也終究小能「脫胎換骨」而獨樂其樂！勝負非所計的如能放遠目光，把這些錢財移用到急需之處，則更幸甚。在勝利曙光即在目前的現在，也祇有救護人衆，才是有利於己的</p>
<p>請看着那些「漁翁二葬身在魚腹之中罷！</p>
<h3>「清潔工人罷工」後感</h3>
<p>— 直之</p>
<p>由於各物價格猛漲不已的結果，所見所聞，是一片如何悲慘的景狀和哀號求助的呼聲！並且，我們又可以明白的看到，對於高物價下感受最大打擊的人員，又自然要算一批勞苦的工人和中卞層依着所得爲命的低微薪給階級的人們，這是事實，千眞萬確的事實！所以，他們爲了個人的生活，爲了合家老少的前途生計上着想，除了自我的减低消費，儘力的壓抑和節約以外，猶感到收支無法相合，而最後一條生活可走的道路，便是向老關的提出要求加薪的呼號哀鳴來！試看了一年以來若干廠家勞資的糾紛，幾個大公司裏全體職員的要求不遂而忍痛停業，公共汽車司機等之罷工情形，……道次本市淸潔工人於本星期天起全體總罷工的原因和癥結，亦就如此。</p>
<p>綜計此次罷工中的淸潔工人，包括有馬路淸道夫，倒糞夫，於此，我們首先便得承認的，他們的這些工作，是何等的重要呀！對於整個全市社會的衛生問題，市容的整飭問題，都繫於這端工作的進行不輟上，因此，本市市民和關係當局，自當迅即開誠佈公以磋商，希求獲得一合理解決的途徑，以便社會情形恢復正常。筆者於萬分關念之餘，還願一陳愚衷於後：</p>
<p>第一，寄願於租界行政當局。本來，關於平抑本市物價這一至重且要的問題，原爲中國政府應有處置辦法的，然而既以本市目下情形的特殊，政府權力暫時不得遠達關係，自然租界當局，爲維持社會安寗和秩序起見，有全力暫代我國政府執行處置之權宜，此在過去，當局固已定有抑制辦法，然而爲目今救急計，更應不辭一切，雷厲執行之，務求達獲預期的目的。其次，於可能範圍內，接受或修正工人們所提出的合理要求，使彼等重可安心工作，弗令罷工局面，僵持而延時日。</p>
<p>第二，厚望於全體工人們的。你們這次的目的，爲求增資，解決生活，所以，在可能範圍內，也只有誠意磋商，靜待解決，弗爲其他者乘機利用，而重復你們的舊業。</p>
<h3>提供幾點意見：　怎訴抵制「小竊黨」</h3>
<p>— 新亮</p>
<p>讀完了慶賢君的「小竊黨」之後，我心中立時感到了萬分的驚恐，正所謂「把中國的小國民用威迫利誘的恐怖手段去引入盜匪之路」，這種罪惡的確是罪不可恕的。</p>
<p>當時，我就把這個問題來與朋友們討論，討論的結果，得到了下面幾點，直接間接都可以抵制勾引「小竊黨」的活動：</p>
<p>當父母當敎師的該隨時隨地注意小孩子與小學生們的舉動，如果一有例外的行爲，就該立即盤查究問。</p>
<p>切不可讓孩子獨自出去游玩，或看電影。</p>
<p>學校與家庭兩方面都須將校友錄，通訊錄之類妥妥保存，以防歹人們利用這種册子來作各項的欺詐。</p>
<p>在卒日當長輩的就該訓導兒女輩切不要養成貪吃糖或貪看影戲的習慣，尤要的，我們必須「以身作則」地作榜樣給他們看。</p>
<p>最後，我還希望立在家庭與學校之外的人們，能够大家共同起來協助抵制，爲我們年靑的一代，我們每個人對這都該負起責任來。</p>
<h3>川米不貴　每石不足二十元</h3>
<p>昨接不具名讀者來函：聲稱日前本刊所載「四川物價近况」內，米價每斗十元項下，並未註明量衡之分別，應予補正。因四川未之區，而售價達百元一石，足以刺激上海奸商之藉口。殊不知四川以五十斤爲一斗，二十兩作一斤，一斗合市秤七十斤有奇，合上海市價則每石不足二十元。</p>
<h3>雨過天青</h3>
<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>第廿四回　湖山蕩滌各有千秋　士女歡騰共呼萬歲</p>
<p>那時家庭旅行車便向嘉興進發，也是預先約定的，有人招待。吃過飯後，即向蘇州進發。因爲這一帶盡是水鄕，沿路的天然風景，到處足洪流連。但他們今天到了安樂鎭，要請蘇理雅太太看看醫院與嬰院。又要到自由村，再去量度何家兩位小姐織綢廠的廠址，而且他們今天要趕回上海，這可不能再耽擱了。指明了方向，車子便直向安樂鎮而來。原來昨天晚上住居在湖州環湖第三旅館的時候，朱愛人便打一個長途電話到安樂鎭，吿訴老章醫師，說是明天下午，蘇理雅太太和林建成金澹雲一對新婚夫婦，都要到安樂鎭來。老章醫師也要盡一點兒招待之責，因爲知道他們要到下午纔來，也預備開一個茶點會。到了下午兩點半鐘的光景，果然他們的家庭旅行車，已經抵達到安樂鎭的婦孺醫院門首了。蘇琿雅太太本來如老章醫師是熱識的，她們倆不但是在中國認識，便是當老章醫師在美國學醫的時代，也就認識的了。舊雨重逢，自然十分親熱，朱愛人到了自己的醫院裏，如同到了自己的家裏一般。她幫同了老章醫師，招待一切，讓蘇理雅太太與老章醫師兩人談心，她便導引了林建成夫婦，與部慧華到醫院各處觀看。何家兩位小姐，曾經住居在這裏，各處地方，都已看過，但今天也隨着他們一同走走。當然在他們幾位，怎麼大的醫院，也都看過，這個婦孺醫院，眞是區區不足道哉。但朱愛人說：「這不過是一個鄉村醫院。鄉村醫院，有許多地方，不能與大都市的醫院相比。但鄉村醫院，須以另一種眼光來看，要省儉而又舒適，務使病人身心俱泰。還有的一個主義，鄕村醫院，須求普遍。雖然自從中國復興以來，這幾年裏，中國內地各處，添設了不少醫院。但是以人口比例來計算中國設立的醫院，還是差得多咧。以國家的力量，往往有些來不及，這全仗一般國民，對於公益事業的贊助。所以與其在大都市設立一個規模宏備的大醫院，不如在內地設立十個鄉村醫院，救濟人的力量，較爲普遍。試想一個鄉村，倘使周圍十里，沒有一個醫院，那是使村民有多少不便呀！』　（二七九）</p>

<h3>有味電影試驗成功</h3>
<p>— 新亮</p>
<p>開影史的新紀元　二十種不同的氣味　隨音軌上散放出來　瑞士發明家的貢獻</p>
<p>電影的歷史，雖然還只有短短的五十年，可是這五十年來的進步，眞是够驚人的—由無聲而有聲，由有聲而五彩而電視；現在，就在不次的將來，我們又將有種「有味電影」了。據外報載：有兩位瑞士的發明家，發明了一種新奇的方法，能够使攝影軟片上非但帶有一種音軌，還可以具有一種所謂「味」軌，它能够在影片開映時，把所需的氣味放出來。</p>
<p>所謂「有味電影」的宣傳，由來也很久了；有許多人就以爲它是沒有價値的。試想呀，人們如今坐在影戲院里靜靜的聽着有聲影片上的發音與對白，如果再叫他們拉長了鼻子去聞影片上的氣味，那眞是多麽惱人的一椿事啊。</p>
<p>然而事實上，「有味的聲片」終於在世間與我們人類相見了。約兩個月之前，這兩位瑞士發明家在貝爾恩（Berne)地方，曾有過一次秘密的試騐，結果呢，計有二十種不同的味道可以隨音軌上的發音同時放出來。</p>
<p>當片中的一個女主角走入一個紫蘿蘭的花圃時。影戲院里就會充滿了紫蘿蘭的香氣。當她跨入一個醫院的門口時，觀衆們就隨着會聞到那麻醉藥的味道。</p>
<p>「一請閉了眼睛想一想。」這兩位發明家中有一位就如此地說：「片上映出某家旅館里的吸烟室時，我們就會聞到强烈的　茄烟味。接着—哈，哈—葛萊泰嘉實走了進來，一陣撲鼻的香粉氣味就會立刻把烟味趕走。」眞的，太希奇了！</p>
<p>常天然色五彩片才發明的時候，我們曾有過一個笑話。相傳有一個人立在正開映有彩片的家影戲館前，在她的　項項里，掛有這樣的一塊紙牌：「請施捨一辨士吧，我是一個惠色盲的可憐人。」如今，在不久的將來，也許有個人會立到他後面去，他那塊紙牌上却寫着：「請也施捨一個銅板吧，我今天子患重傷風呢。」</p>
<p>「有味電影」無疑地將在電影史上開創一個新紀元，在這里，就讓我們謝謝這兩位瑞士發明家吧。</p>

<p>歐陽予倩最近派員，轉道香港來滬，擬邀聘平劇話劇藝員入桂，因歐陽主持之南華劇塲本月底即可竣工，下月初將正式揭幕；該塲直屬於廣西省立戲劇學院，每月由該院津貼經費九千元，劇場共分四個：兩個演桂劇，演平劇，一演話劇。桂劇由桂劇名角小金鳳擔任臺柱，平劇話劇則向上海方面邀聘角色前往合作，並已開列理想的名單。港方一般人以爲前進坤伶金素琴當爲歐陽予倩所屬意之人，由事實則不然，因金素琴乃不易招徠之人物。又該戲劇音學院之繪畫部份由徐悲鴻主持，戲劇則由歐陽自　。</p>
<p>據般情形看來，平劇藝員之入桂，則以滬上之李瑞來。呂君樵，葛次江，李順來諸人較有可能，而話劇藝員除滬地佔多數外，香港方面亦有大批話劇人員入桂，前中華藝術劇團之主持人李化，早已參加，今後一部話劇工作恐將山李化領導演出。</p>

<p>新藝的團員們因爲自己的志願能够實現，光明的前途就在前面，所以個個都帶着興奮和愉快的神情，對於這牢籠似的孤島，並沒有一些留戀。是的，他們是去創　新生命的，負起了重大的使命，盡他們應盡的責任，替平劇界打開一條轉變的路綫，我從碼頭上回來，心裏祝福他們脚踏實地的去悴，得到最後的成功和勝利。</p>

<h3>The War on the Border Between Henan and Hubei Becomes Increasingly Fierce: Chinese Troops Force Their Way to the Outskirts of Zaoyang City; Japanese Troops in Huyang Town, Chengjiahe, and Other Places Have Been Cleared; More Than 600 Japanese Vehicles Captured in Luyanzhen</h3>
<p>Luoyang: The fierce battle surrounding Zaoyang has continued for days. Since the 11th, the large Chinese army has been mopping up the Japanese in Shuangqiao, Chengjiahe, Cangtai, Huyang Town (all north of Zaoyang), and other places. By the morning of the 14th, the remaining Japanese in various places had been cleared one after another. The Chinese have forced their way to the outskirts of Zaoyang city and are intensifying their attacks on the stubbornly resisting Japanese. At the same time, a certain Chinese unit bypassed the eastern side of Zaoyang on the 14th, capturing Tangxian Town in one fell swoop, cutting off the Suizao transportation line, and placing the Japanese in Zaoyang in a state of siege on all sides. (16th dispatch)</p>
<p>Fancheng: For days, the Chinese army has been pursuing the retreating Japanese troops on the border between Henan and Hubei, driving them to a small area near Zaoyang, where they are being annihilated. Since the 14th, a fierce attack has been launched from all sides, making rapid progress. The entire Japanese position is within the fire net of Chinese artillery. In the northwest corner of Zaoyang, the Japanese abandoned more than 4,300 corpses. By late last night, the Japanese were unable to struggle and retreated again, fleeing south along the Zaoyang-Zhongxiang highway, where they were intercepted by the Chinese at Fangjiaji and Tianjiaji (both near the southwest of Zaoyang). The Chinese pursuing troops also arrived in three routes to sandwich them. The Japanese desperately tried to break through, but ultimately suffered heavy casualties, with corpses littering the road. Among them was a high-ranking Japanese commander, and his successor was also seriously wounded, causing the Japanese to be unable to escape the path of annihilation. The Chinese are still expanding their victories in all directions. One route retreated southeast along the Xianghua Highway, gathering remnants and desperately charging, but were firmly blocked by the Chinese army and defeated again. At the same time, the Chinese besieging troops continued to attack fiercely, further shrinking the encirclement. The date of the complete annihilation of this route of the Japanese is imminent. In addition, the Japanese also launched multiple cavalry counterattacks from the northeast, attempting to reopen a passage to the Nanzhao Highway, but were fiercely attacked by the Chinese in the area between Huyang Town and Zaoyang. The Japanese cavalry suffered heavy losses and scattered and retreated. The Chinese army divided and pursued, capturing 740 Japanese horses and more than 600 Japanese vehicles southeast of Luyanzhen. Of the two thousand and hundreds of Japanese vehicles used on the battlefield, almost all of them have now been taken by the Chinese. (16th dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing: A Chinese military spokesman recently stated that the result of the Japanese army's large-scale offensive against the Chinese army's positions in the Tongbai Mountain area of southern Henan and northern Hubei over the past two weeks was not only without success but also resulted in the loss of as many as 50,000 soldiers. In this battle, there were 200 Japanese tanks participating in the fighting, of which 69 have been seized by the Chinese army. In addition, the Chinese army seized 3,000 warhorses and 2,000 other vehicles. The Japanese army advanced into the border area between Henan and Hubei from five routes, but the Chinese army attacked its rear for military strategy from the front, so each point was defeated by the Chinese army. (16th dispatch from the Associated Press)</p>
<p>Chongqing: The Chinese Military Headquarters announced that the Chinese army captured Changtaiguan, a Japanese army base on the Pinghan Railway, at noon yesterday. The Japanese troops on the Nanzhao and Nanxin highways have now been cleared. The Chinese army also captured Tangxian Town, an important stronghold on the Xinhuag Highway. The Chinese army is currently attacking Tianmen on the Hanyi Highway. Approximately 40,000 Japanese troops are currently surrounded in the suburbs of Zaoyang, and the Chinese army is shrinking the encirclement. Two Japanese brigades are currently rushing from several places downstream of the Yangtze River to aid the Japanese troops besieged northwest of Hankou. It is reported that Japanese General Staff Officer Itagaki, due to the current desperate situation of the Japanese army in the area, has arrived in Hankou to personally direct the battle. (16th dispatch from Reuters)</p>
<p>Chongqing: Chinese sources today claimed that the Chinese army launched a general offensive along the border between Henan and Hubei yesterday, the purpose of which was to encircle the Japanese army there. The Chinese army intercepted a Japanese transport team in the Zaoyang area of northern Hubei. (16th dispatch from the Associated Press)</p>
<p>Fancheng: The Chinese army, advancing north from Dabie Mountain towards Yanyang, has been intercepting the fleeing Japanese troops for days, achieving great victories. Several thousand Japanese troops, who were continuously fleeing south through Biangou, were fiercely intercepted by the Chinese north of Yushan and near Huanglongdang. After more than ten fierce battles, the Japanese suffered heavy losses. The remaining Japanese troops attempted to retreat east but were relentlessly pursued by various Chinese units, who took the opportunity to ambush them in the Tingjiawan, Gengjiaji, and Liangjiaji areas on both banks of the Gun River. The Japanese left behind more than a thousand corpses, abandoning military supplies all over the mountains. Along the east bank of the Xiang River, Dongjinwan, Zhujiaji, and Nanying, they fled south in droves. The Chinese army is currently intercepting and annihilating them separately. (15th dispatch)</p>
<p>Fancheng: The Chinese army is using ingenious tactics to implement an encirclement and annihilation battle against the Japanese in southern Henan, northern Hubei, and central Hubei, which has achieved remarkable results. Currently, the remaining Japanese troops are suffering the most in the Zaoyang area because the large Chinese army is rushing straight to the rear of Zaoyang, completely cutting off the Japanese rear, while also pressing towards Zaoyang from all sides. The Japanese troops occupying Zaoyang have fallen into a desperate situation. Luyanzhen (northwest of Zaoyang), the only stronghold on which the Japanese relied to contain the eastward advance of the large Chinese army on the west bank of the Tang River, was also recaptured by the Chinese on the 15th. In addition, the large Chinese army in southern Henan is now surrounding Xinyang. (15th dispatch)</p>
<p>Yichang: The Chinese army has been attacking the Japanese troops trapped in Qianjiang for days, achieving considerable victories. A unit of Japanese infantry and cavalry advanced to Maojiawan near Qianjiang and engaged in a fierce battle with the Chinese. More than 200 Japanese soldiers were completely annihilated. The Chinese army seized 30 light and heavy machine guns and countless military equipment. In addition, there have been fierce battles between the Chinese and Japanese forces in the Tiandou and Xiantao areas in the past week. The Japanese troops are trapped in the city and dare not go out. The Chinese are currently besieging and annihilating them. (15th dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Near Qinshui Suffer Repeated Heavy Losses</h3>

The Japanese suffered more than 300 casualties. (2) On the same day, another Chinese unit attacked Qinglonggou, northwest of Qinshui, killing more than 100 Japanese soldiers. On the 10th, they intercepted more than 20 Japanese vehicles attacking east from Yicheng near the same location, destroying eight vehicles. The Japanese left behind more than 300 corpses. (3) On the 10th, the Chinese army ambushed the Japanese in Xiwangzhai, Qinshui. Soon, more than 40 Japanese vehicles drove westward. The Chinese launched a fierce attack.

<p>Luoyang: The Chinese army in southern Shanxi has been quite successful in annihilating the Japanese troops in recent days. (1) After the main force of the Japanese army, which attacked south from the vicinity of Yangcheng, was defeated by the Chinese near Shuzhi on the 12th, a part broke through and retreated southeast to Matoushen, where they were attacked from both sides by the pursuing Chinese troops and the Chinese army near the area. All the Japanese troops were annihilated. Another part of the remaining Japanese troops moved south to the Shijialing, Dujiazhuang, and Xizhuang areas on the evening of the same day, attempting to resist stubbornly, but were severely attacked by the Chinese army again. (2) On the 11th, a part of the Chinese army ambushed a train of Japanese soldiers heading north near the Dongzhen Station on the Tongpu Railway, destroying one locomotive and five carriages, killing many Japanese soldiers, and seizing a large number of military supplies. (16th dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japanese Soldiers on the Pinghan Line Hit Landmines</h3>
<p>Luoyang: The Chinese army in northern Henan laid landmines near Luozhuang, south of Shilian Temple Station (south of Pengde) on the Pinghan Railway. On the morning of the 8th, a train of Japanese soldiers traveling from north to south detonated a landmine, destroying five vehicles and causing more than 100 Japanese casualties.

<h3>The Nanyang Comfort Mission Leaves Changsha and Goes South</h3>
<p>Changsha: The Nanyang Comfort Mission left Changsha on the morning of the 16th and went south to inspect the Hengyang, Ji'an, and Shaozhou areas. Before leaving, according to the head of the mission, Chen, told the Central News Agency reporter that the impression gained from this trip was extremely good. The people of southern Hunan are enthusiastic, and the products are abundant, which is a major pillar for the war of resistance and national reconstruction. Although Changsha is close to the front line, the people are still calm and composed, which is a sign of recovery. Furthermore, the victory in northern Hunan was due to the people assisting the army in combat. The group was deeply moved by witnessing these loyal and courageous deeds and celebrated the future of our country and nation. The overseas Chinese in Nanyang should follow the spirit of Hunan and go to the national crisis together to regain our homeland. Chen also said that they would rather be poor people in a strong country than rich people in a weak country, and a kind of patriotic enthusiasm for contributing money and effort overflowed in their words.

<h3>Achievements of the Chinese Army in Combat</h3>
<p>Luoyang: More than 200 people who made continued and outstanding contributions in the Chinese army's offensive on Kaifeng in eastern Henan on the 23rd of last month have been rewarded by the authorities.

Finally, he withdrew from the city wall with his company commander, still ashamed that he could not kill all the Japanese soldiers. (3) Chen Xunzu, a third-class soldier of the company X's squad, was a machine gunner whose bullets never missed. He killed more than 50 Japanese soldiers after entering Kaifeng City. Finally, his hand was injured, and the company commander ordered him to withdraw and hand over the gun to others.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>An Analysis of the Recent Evolution of the European War</h3>
<p>The evolution of the European war situation in the past week is very different from the past nine months, forming a brand new situation. The European war may be in its final stage, or at least it is the most important stage. It is related to the vast international and distant future, so readers, please pay attention! We do not want to make any criticisms or inferences about this in a hurry, but we would like to analyze several things: First, what is obvious to all is the expansion of the scope of the war. Tracing back to the initial war between Germany and Poland and against Britain and France, followed by Germany occupying Denmark and attacking Norway; now, the German army has swept through Luxembourg, conquered the military and civilians of the Netherlands, and gone straight to Belgium and into France. This fact encompasses more participating countries, wider war zones, longer battle lines, and more hostile people. Second, Germany's actions are military first; that is, all choices are based on military interests; therefore, when it attacked Norway, it still had so-called arguments, still debated right and wrong with Britain and France, and shirked responsibility to each other; now, in the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg, in addition to marching, it is also advancing rapidly in international diplomacy. This implies that the belligerent countries, starting from Germany, are waging war without regard to anything, denying the rights of other countries and denying the rights of neutral countries under international law. Third, dissecting the overall war situation at the current stage, taking Germany as the center, the flank where the German army clashed with the British, French, and Norwegian Allied forces in Norway is the right wing, the Siegfried Line and the Maginot Line facing each other is the left wing, and the route through Luxembourg and the Netherlands, that is, taking the Netherlands and Belgium as strongholds, is the central route; the central route directly threatens the heart of the two countries of England and France, not only where the main German forces are located, but can indeed be regarded as the direction of all German efforts. Therefore, the skirmishes between the French and German defense lines a week ago and for nine months, the cannon bombardment, the aircraft spying, and the skirmishes between sentinels were just a comedy before the curtain, a prelude to the symphony; but now and in the future, both sides will use their ancestors and descendants as bets, overturning history and creating history, starting from here. Fourth, land warfare and naval warfare have the longest history and the richest experience, and can generally be said to know each other well. As for aerial warfare, in the previous stage when the two sides fought in Norway, both sides had new achievements and Germany reaped new results; but the matter was already in the minds of military experts, and only during the Norwegian campaign did they obtain strong and solid proof through field testing. In the past two or three days, it has been rumored that Germany used "death rays" and achieved great success, but the details cannot be heard. The Germans themselves also arrogantly claimed that we do have new weapons. A more detailed description is that yesterday, the Berlin telegram said, "Two Belgian officers who defended the Liege fortress were captured by the German army and have been escorted to the German capital yesterday; when talking about the new weapons used by the German army, it is said that we could not use cannons and machine guns at the time, because we found that our guns and cannons suddenly could not fire. "The reporter of the Haitian News Agency asked the responsible party, who replied, "We do have new weapons for attack, but its nature and effectiveness are difficult to explain temporarily." The words are ambiguous, the matter is hazy, and the telegram comes from Berlin and the words are from the Germans. Those who are concerned with science should not believe or doubt arbitrarily; believing must be based on science, not believing must be based on science, and doubting must also be based on science. We have absolutely nothing to base it on here. If the matter is credible, then it belongs to something unprecedented; we will have no way to deny all kinds of unexpected possibilities for the future of the war situation and even the world situation. Fifth, regarding Italy's attitude towards the European war, we still retain the observations described in the recent repeated resolutions, believing that it depends on the progress and success or failure of Germany's military operations. In the past week, the German army has obviously made local progress and local achievements, so Italy's attitude has also obviously made a corresponding emphasis. What is called quantity, we deeply regret that we cannot make a more specific explanation outside of saying that it is commensurate; however, there are things that can be used to set off what its quantity is: One is that Washington's telegram yesterday said that US President Roosevelt, based on the most shocking intelligence, immediately appealed to Italian Prime Minister Mussolini for peace again; two is that US embassies and consulates in Italy advised American expatriates in Italy not to stay unless necessary; three is that the British and French fleets stationed in the Mediterranean, on the opposite shore of Italy, that is, outside the port of Alexandria, Egypt, started a large-scale joint exercise yesterday; four is that the consuls of Italy and the United States in Egypt each advised their expatriates in Egypt to prepare to leave Egypt at any time; five is that Switzerland, located between France, Germany, and Italy, in addition to mobilizing for military measures recently, the various international organizations in Geneva, the capital of Switzerland, second only to the League of Nations, are preparing for any eventuality; six is that Yugoslavia, a country in southeastern Europe, located between Germany and Italy, is experiencing this international hurricane very strongly, and has been particularly turbulent and shaken recently, with myriad signs of unease; in short, with Italy as the center, it is full of the smell of gunpowder, and it is no less than the eve of the arrival of the god of war. All the above analysis has yielded nothing more than the new situation in the past week that is very different from the past; how it will trend, we not only do not want to infer, but also hope that readers will only pay attention to its changes. It is important to know that the outcome of the war is determined in the last five minutes, and the intermediate phenomena and momentum are not enough to be used as a basis for judgment; and what the facts will reveal to the world in the near future is: whether Germany's blitzkrieg strategy will succeed or fail, and whether Italy's vacillation will finally move or remain still; after obtaining the answer to this fact, it will not be too late to study all kinds of possible developments afterward.</p>
<h3>The Battle Near the Meuse River and Around Sedan: Allied Forces Launch a Full-Scale Counteroffensive; German Mechanized Units' Offensive Slightly Halted; Decisive Battle Reaches Critical Juncture</h3>
<p>Paris: General Headquarters has just released a report stating that enemy forces, today, along a line from Antwerp in Belgium to the northwest of Namur, have launched repeated and fierce offensives against the Allied forces of England, France, and Belgium, using tank units for cover. All attacks were repelled. The enemy also forcibly crossed the Meuse River at a certain point between Namur and Mézières in France, and the battle is still in progress. In the region of Sedan, the enemy has made some progress. Our forces are launching a large-scale counteroffensive with tanks and aircraft. Both sides' artillery are bombarding each other east of Sedan. In addition, our air force continues reconnaissance flights, and fighter planes have engaged in repeated dogfights with enemy planes, shooting down a total of eleven enemy aircraft. (Havas, 15th)</p>
<p>German Führer's Headquarters: This afternoon's German war bulletin stated that the Belgian army, using the Antwerp fortress to the Dyle Line and the Namur fortress as the battle line, was defeated by German forces southwest of Namur. German forces have expanded their influence to the west bank of the Meuse River. French forces launched a counteroffensive with heavy tanks in the southern part of the salient, but were repelled by German forces, and several heavy tanks were destroyed. Between the Moselle and Rhine rivers, German positions have extended to the west of Saarlautern. Near Lauterbourg, yesterday, the German air force fiercely attacked enemy forces and transportation routes, destroying many enemy tanks. (Haitong Agency, 16th)</p>
<p>Berlin: German military authorities have just stated that the outcome of the battles in Belgium will be decided within seven days, with victory belonging to the German side. The German victory in Belgium is sufficient to mark the end of one part of the war and the beginning of another. This victory is enough to shatter Allied resistance in Belgium and provide the German air force and submarines with a new base from which to bomb England and destroy the supply lines from England to France. Moreover, as a result of the German victory, the Allies' retreat routes have no defenses or strategic points to hold. Therefore, German forces can drive straight in to reach Paris. Furthermore, the German victory in Belgium creates a situation that makes Italy more confident that assisting German forces in joining the war is beneficial. (United Press, 16th)</p>
<p>London: A Reuters correspondent traveling with British troops in Belgium reports that, as far as the British forces are concerned, although fierce fighting has occurred in the Leuven area, the main German effort is currently on the more southern front from Namur to Sedan. German forces have launched the most formidable offensive against the French forces in that area. The German method of attack is, first, a less intense artillery bombardment, followed by a sudden attack with a large number of tanks, and then assisted by low-flying aircraft, bombing and strafing the defending troops with machine guns. Infantry units, under these circumstances, have had to retreat slightly, to counterattack after they have sufficient strength. Currently, French forces have launched a counteroffensive against German forces that have crossed the Meuse River or are still in the process of counterattacking. (Reuters, 16th)</p>
<p>French Forces Launch Counteroffensive Along the Moselle River; Significant Progress Reportedly Made</p>
<p>Paris: Military sources here stated that fierce developments are occurring on all fronts. A summary follows: (1) Allied forces in the northern part of Belgium, near Antwerp, are cooperating with troops stationed in Zeeland, Netherlands, and are engaging the main German forces between Antwerp and Namur. Repeated and fierce German offensives have been unsuccessful. (2) Fierce fighting continues around Namur and Sedan, and has expanded to the left bank of the Meuse River. German armored units have penetrated deep, losing contact with the army. French forces have launched a large-scale counteroffensive along the Meuse River, making significant progress. Therefore, German forces have not yet reached the eastern suburbs of Sedan. (3) The situation around Sedan and the Swiss border remains unchanged, with only small-scale fighting occurring. According to a war bulletin released this morning by the French President's headquarters, the Ardennes region is quiet. However, sources responsible claim that the Maginot Line from Sedan to the Swiss border remains intact and has not been breached by German forces. (4) French forces have fiercely bombed German positions along the Rhine River, with considerable success, destroying most of the enemy's military supplies stored on the opposite bank.</p>
<p>German Forces Launch Large-Scale Offensive on Leuven, Aiming for Brussels as Final Target</p>
<p>Front Line of the French Expeditionary Force: The battle for Brussels by German forces began yesterday. German forces launched a large-scale bombardment of Leuven, located fifteen miles from Brussels, a historic cathedral town. The main Allied forces resisted the overwhelming German forces. Allied aircraft received some resistance while bombing bridges and fortresses over the Maas River and strafing German mechanized units with machine guns. Advance mechanized units returning from forward operating bases reported that the German advance along the front lines of Aarschot and Leuven was intensifying. Allied forces have formed a defensive line in the Kette valley from Wavre to Tienen and are strongly defending the fortresses of Aarschot and Namur. (United Press, 16th)</p>
<p>Dense German Tank Attacks; Trench Warfare Transforms into Mobile Warfare</p>
<p>Paris: Fierce fighting lasted all day yesterday along the banks of the Meuse River from Namur to Sedan. According to a French army spokesman last night, the fighting there resembled a "great storm." The German side deployed a large army, using the same tactics as in the Polish campaign, but launching a full-line attack over a longer period than in 1914. The German forces used relatively fewer artillery pieces, but employed armored and mechanized columns and a large number of aircraft to bomb and strafe French infantry, advancing very quickly. French forces resisted bravely, but in some locations, facing dense attacks by large German tank formations, they had to retreat. Yesterday, German tank formations broke through French lines at three locations on the left bank of the Meuse River south of Namur, then dispersed in all directions, causing confusion that lasted all day. French tanks launched counterattacks, and French infantry, after the German armored columns had passed, advanced to engage enemy reinforcements, launching fierce bayonet charges. The German offensive has transformed the trench warfare behind the lines into mobile warfare. The German offensive method is to concentrate tanks to break through the lines, with infantry following behind. Given this change in the nature of the war, the French command spent all day reorganizing the French forces to block the advance of some German columns and consolidate positions and close gaps in the new lines. The German side has amassed a large number of troops and equipment between Sedan and Namur. According to sources here last night, although the current situation is serious, it is not critical. The French command maintains a calm determination and belief. (Reuters, 16th)</p>

<h3>German Troops Enter the Capital of the Netherlands; Dutch Instrument of Surrender Signed; Dutch Foreign Minister States 100,000 Dutch Soldiers Killed in Action</h3>
<p>London: The capital of the Netherlands has been occupied by German troops. The first batch of German motorized units reached the outskirts at 1 PM and then formally entered the city, where they were received by government officials led by the mayor. The public witnessed the arrival of the German troops calmly. (Havas, 15th)</p>
<p>Berlin: German military headquarters just announced that the Dutch surrender document was signed yesterday at 11 AM by the commanders-in-chief of the German and Dutch armies. (Reuters, 16th)</p>
<p>The Hague: The Dutch Commander-in-Chief broadcast an order from the Hilversum radio station stating that Dutch soldiers must not leave their posts until further orders are given. (Haitong, 16th)</p>
<p>Paris: Dutch Foreign Minister Kleffens declared yesterday afternoon that a quarter of the 400,000 Dutch soldiers had been killed in action. Kleffens also insisted that the Dutch government and nation had not surrendered, and that the country was continuing to fight Germany. The world should continue to pay attention to the map of the Netherlands. We will provide the Allied forces with great resources and will fight to the final victory. Kleffens also detailed how the last Dutch bomber was loaded with bombs, took off, and then disappeared without a trace. (Reuters, 16th)</p>
<p>Paris: A French journalist who recently returned from Amsterdam told people about the impact of the German "Fifth Column" (i.e., spies) in the Netherlands. He said that the number of Germans hiding throughout the Netherlands was far beyond what people generally expected, and they formed a most formidable force combined with the paratroopers who had landed. Two important bridges in Moerdijk were destroyed by German assault teams who had been hiding nearby for many days. The occupation of the seaplane base near Rotterdam and other locations was the same. After deploying all troops to the front lines, the Dutch General Staff had to recall thousands of troops to defend roads and key points in the rear because of the discovery of this situation. The reporter also said that the general fear caused by the German "Fifth Column" in the Netherlands was astonishing. While traveling with a French army officer, what he saw almost made him feel like he was in a civil war. Almost every ten steps, someone checked his documents. After he arrived at the headquarters, when checking the documents, two people with handguns stood by to watch. No one felt safe in the Netherlands, and even those with credentials issued by the Commander-in-Chief were often disturbed. It was heard that a sentry, because he was too hot-blooded, knocked the Queen's attendant to the ground. (Reuters, 16th)</p>
<p>New York: The New York Herald Tribune reported that 25,000 German immigrants in the Netherlands were quite alarmed yesterday upon hearing the news that the Dutch army had ceased resistance. They flocked to the consulates of France, Belgium, and the United States to inquire about ways to escape. (Reuters, 16th)</p>
<p>Paris: A key Dutch figure, upon leaving The Hague, told a representative of the French news agency that our experience can provide a lesson for neutral countries neighboring Germany. The Dutch General Staff, in order to avoid "provoking" the Germans, never had any contact with Allied staff who could have assisted us. Only eight days ago, the Netherlands refused to notify the Allied countries of its mobilization plans and air preparations. We were unwilling to discuss strategy with other countries, even Belgium, sacrificing important contact with neutral friends overseas and having to sacrifice resistance to internal enemies, namely the freedom of action of Dutch Nazis protected by Berlin. (Reuters, 16th)</p>
<p>London: The official German radio station broadcast a communiqué from the German military headquarters yesterday afternoon, warning Germans not to be overly optimistic after the victory in the Netherlands, saying, "These victories have not yet determined the outcome. Now that the Netherlands has surrendered, the German army is almost at the doorstep of England. German aircraft can now reach England in an hour." (Reuters, 16th)</p>
<p>Berlin: German military officials, yesterday, met with a reporter from the Haitong news agency and gave a speech, strongly praising the heroic spirit of the Dutch army in this battle and the bright attitude of this surrender. They claimed that the surrender of the Dutch army was due to the unreliability of British aid, especially the significant losses of the British navy in the past few days, including three cruisers, one destroyer, and several merchant ships, which led to a change of plans. The essence of Germany's occupation of almost all of the Netherlands has three points: (1) All dangers to the German Ruhr area have been eliminated. (2) The Rhine estuary and the ports of the Dutch North Sea are all under German control. (3) After Germany occupies the Dutch ports, the route for attacking England is greatly shortened, averaging only twenty minutes to fly to central England. (Haitong, 16th)</p>
<h3>Queen of the Netherlands Delivers a Solemn Speech, Blesses the Allied Nations</h3>
<p>London: At 9 PM last night, Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands delivered a radio address in English to the British Empire, saying: "I and my people have always hoped that the scope of the European war could be limited and that in the near future, a lasting peace could be built on a reasonable foundation. We have also fervently prayed that nations could have mutual understanding. Today, all of this seems to prove ineffective. After Norway, a progressive and civilized country, was brutally invaded, the Netherlands and Belgium followed. Even if these two countries could be succeeded, they are more doubtful than Norway, because these two countries have always exhausted their ability to express their determination to maintain neutrality and have repeatedly been willing to do their part to mediate, so that the warring countries can re-establish contact, which may lead to the end of the war. Today, we must admit that if we do not effectively contain those who are solely responsible for creating the current situation and prevent them from continuing to destroy things at will, completely disregarding the most basic principles of morality and law, it is difficult to expect happiness in this world. After my country made a heroic struggle, all its ability to maintain peace was defeated by the absolute superiority of power. But the enemy can never conquer us. Our spirit remains intact, because our conscience is as clear as ever. My people will inevitably suffer great pain in the current situation, and their lives under tyranny will not end until the country sees freedom again. But I firmly believe that their faith in freedom and justice will never be abandoned. I pray that God will bless the Allied nations' cause, that dawn will soon appear, and that the freedom of the Netherlands and other countries invaded by Germany will be fully restored. I would be most fortunate." After the Queen finished speaking, the sound of Dutch national music filled the air. The Queen's speech was broadcast from Buckingham Palace. This morning at 9 AM (Shanghai time), the Queen will make a similar broadcast to the United States. (Reuters, 16th)</p>
<h3>The Mystery of New Weapons Used by German Forces</h3>
<p>Berlin: Two Belgian officers defending the Liege fortress, after being captured by German forces, were escorted to this place yesterday. Discussing the new weapons used by German forces, they stated, "We could not use cannons and machine guns at the time, because we discovered that our guns suddenly could not fire." Regarding this matter, a reporter from the Haitong news agency yesterday visited the responsible party to inquire about the truth. The answer was, "Indeed, we have new weapons of attack, but we cannot tell you about their nature and effectiveness for the time being." (Haitong, 16th)</p>
<h3>German Air Force Retaliates Against England; Attacks British Airfields in Batches; Many German Aircraft Shot Down</h3>
<p>London: A Reuters correspondent traveling with the British Air Force in France reports that after the German forces that broke into the northeastern corner of France were fiercely bombed by the British Air Force on Tuesday, hindering their advance, the German Air Force carried out barbaric retaliation yesterday. Shortly after 2 PM, German bombers attacked the area where British airfields were located in batches. Heavy explosions could be heard almost every hour. British fighter pilots, although they had been flying continuously since last Friday without rest, still bravely flew to intercept them. By about 6:30 PM, they had shot down two German Dornier bombers and seven Messerschmitt 110 fighter planes equipped with artillery positions. In addition, four other enemy aircraft had been destroyed by British anti-aircraft artillery. A German gunner jumped from a destroyed plane and landed in a village that had been tragically bombed by German planes on Tuesday. The villagers wanted to kill him, but he was saved by British Air Force personnel. (Reuters, 16th)</p>
<p>London: The British fire-fighting force is being strengthened. A plan is now being implemented where public utility workers, divided into small groups, will carry out fire-fighting on their residential streets in times of emergency. Thirty thousand squirt guns will soon be distributed for this purpose. (Reuters, 16th)</p>
<h3>Belgian Foreign Minister Says the Situation is Serious</h3>
<p>Brussels: Foreign Minister Spaak recently told a Havas reporter that the current situation is quite serious. The German strategy is to concentrate a large amount of military equipment under the cover of a large air force and attack a relatively short front line, making it difficult for the defending troops to resist. As a result of the German adoption of this strategy, although the loss of soldiers and military equipment has been considerable, they have finally been able to occupy some land. At a certain location on the front line, the loss and gain under the battle between the two sides has been as many as several times, so destroyed tanks are everywhere. The intensity of the battle can be seen from this. In addition, the number of aircraft dispatched by the German side for combat is about two or three times more than that of the Allied side, so their sacrifices are also greater. For several days, the Allied forces have become accustomed to this large-scale air raid and are no longer surprised by it. British, French, and Belgian troops are now cooperating. Although the troops are exhausted, their morale is excellent. (Havas, 16th)</p>
<h3>Hitler Commends the Air Force</h3>
<p>German General Headquarters: German Führer and Commander-in-Chief of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, Hitler, issued an order commending the Air Force and special units that fought in the Netherlands, stating briefly that the soldiers in the Dutch war zone had, within five days, defeated the stubborn resistance of the army guarding the strong fortresses and made them surrender. This success was due to the close cooperation and brave fighting of the German soldiers, and the achievements of the paratrooper units were especially commendable. (Haitong, 16th)</p>
<h3>German Air Force Suffers Heavy Losses; 690 Aircraft Have Crashed in the Netherlands, Belgium, and France</h3>
<p>London: Air force experts here have stated that Germany's invasion of the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg has lasted five days. During this period, the country has suffered very heavy aircraft losses. The wreckage of 690 of its aircraft has been found in the Netherlands, Belgium, and France. Others that were obviously shot down but whose wreckage has not yet been found, as well as those shot down in Germany, are not included. In one large-scale air battle, German aircraft losses reached 235. As for the losses suffered by British and French aircraft during the same period, they were only about one-third of the German losses. As far as the air force strength of England and France is concerned, due to Britain's increased manufacturing of aircraft and the appointment of Liberal Party leader Sinclair as Secretary of Aviation, it will be greatly strengthened. In addition, the appointment of British newspaper magnate Lord Beaverbrook as Minister of Aircraft Production and Labour Party leader Morrison as Minister of Supply, the cooperation between these two public officials to accelerate aircraft manufacturing will undoubtedly achieve good results. (Reuters, 15th)</p>
<h3>French Premier Delivers Speech in Parliament: The Fate of the Coming Centuries Will Be Decided in a Few Days</h3>
<p>Paris: The National Assembly convened at 3:35 PM, chaired by Speaker Herriot. After passing several minor bills, Prime Minister Reynaud delivered a speech, stating briefly that three independent countries, namely Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg, have now been invaded, following Norway and Denmark. Germany's goal at this time is to strike at the heart of France. Fortunately, Belgium is currently fighting bravely. To this day, France and Belgium are closely related. France's victory is Belgium's victory. Hitler's intention is to achieve victory in two months, because if he does not, he will be spurned by all sides. He is very aware of the current crisis, which is why he is actively preparing to take the offensive. Therefore, the fate of the coming centuries will often be decided in these few months or even days. On this day of crisis, England and France have separately called on all parties in the country to cooperate with each other. French soldiers are currently defending the country with iron and blood. At this time of serious and unpredictable circumstances, we may have to take the strongest measures to ensure safety. It is even possible that everything will change. Therefore, not only must all weaknesses be eliminated, but we must immediately display a new spirit. We all regard death as a return and have great hope. The only thing we care about is maintaining the life of France, so all citizens must rise up! After the Prime Minister finished speaking, all the members applauded enthusiastically, expressing their approval. Speaker Herriot then spoke, praising the Allied forces for their loyalty and bravery. The National Assembly then declared a recess. (Havas, 16th)</p>
<h3>Two Major Soviet Newspapers Comment on the European War Situation: Britain and France Lose the Initiative in the Netherlands and Belgium, Weak and Neutral Countries Learn a New Lesson</h3>
<p>Moscow. The Soviet "Izvestia" recently commented on the European situation, stating, "The war waged by the Anglo-French military bloc against Germany has now entered a new stage. The scope of this war is far greater than the First Imperialist War. The development of the war is based on its own theory, and this theory is more intense and genuine than other theories. Britain and France were preparing to attack Germany through the territories of the Netherlands and Belgium. This time, Germany preempted and took countermeasures. As a result, the Anglo-French command lost its initiative again. The German army's progress in the Netherlands and Belgium has completely changed the military situation, favoring the German side. The German army has now encircled the Maginot Line. After the German army occupied the Dutch coast, its air base is only 300 kilometers away from London, and high-speed bombers can reach it in half an hour. In addition, since the German side has occupied the coasts of Denmark and Norway, it has controlled the North Sea. The German air force has made it impossible for the British navy to carry out offensive operations. Regarding this point, the naval battles in Scandinavia have proved it. Other neutral countries are also threatened by war. The contradictions between the Anglo-French bloc and Italy in the Mediterranean and the Near East have reached a serious stage. We can predict that the Mediterranean and the Balkans will become new battlefields in the near future. Regarding this point, Chamberlain had stated this clearly a few days before he resigned. In the Pacific, the war crisis has also increased. Due to the competition for the succession of the Dutch East Indies, the relations between the United States and Japan are extremely serious. The European war is bound to turn into a world war. Belgium and northern France have become battlefields of life and death. The imperialist war has begun to cause millions of people to lose their lives. Currently, 1.25 billion people (half of humanity) have been drawn into the war in Europe and the Far East. Recent facts have proven that weak countries without military backing cannot maintain neutrality. The hope of weak countries for maintaining neutrality and independence has now vanished. When imperialist powers are fighting a life-and-death battle, it is pointless to talk about the legitimacy or illegitimacy of the treatment of weak countries. Undoubtedly, in the current development of the war situation, imperialism will do its best to make new countries join the war. Some weak countries sincerely hope to maintain their neutrality, but the current development will surely give them new lessons. We would like to solemnly reiterate that some weak and neutral countries are contributing to the expansion of the war. This is a suicidal policy. The slogan of Britain and France is to expand the war, but the result is only this." (TASS telegram, 16th)</p>
<p>Moscow. The "Pravda" recently commented on the European situation, stating, "The Anglo-French bloc had long attempted to make the Netherlands and Belgium join the war against Germany. London and Paris are doing their best to expand the war they launched. This plan had previously won the sympathy of Dutch and Belgian capitalists (who have close ties with Anglo-French capitalists). After the Anglo-French ruling class's plan in Scandinavia failed, they intensified their pressure on the Netherlands and Belgium, forcing them to participate in the war against Germany as soon as possible. Britain and France had already set up military bases in the Netherlands and Belgium to attack Germany's lifeline. This time, Germany moved a step ahead of its enemies, destroying their conspiracy, and at the same time gaining a superior position in the new battlefield. In this new stage, the German army has taken the offensive, and its position has indeed become superior. After the German army reached the border between Belgium and France, it crossed the border in several places, threatening the center of France, and consolidating its air bases for attacking Britain. At this point, the direct confrontation of the warring countries' troops has become more urgent. In fact, Britain and France are trying to avoid this direct confrontation. Therefore, the German army's operational goal is not only to gain a favorable position, but also to give the Allied forces a decisive blow to their strategy. Judging from recent developments, the Anglo-French military strategy is to create a new smokescreen, using small neutral countries as tools. This smokescreen has two purposes: (1) to force these small countries to fight for the interests of the Anglo-French bloc; (2) to intensify the blockade against Germany. Regarding this point, Britain and France can only boast of one success: that is, they have drawn two small countries into the war. Although British and French newspapers express sorrow for the fate of small countries and strongly denounce Germany's violation of international law, this kind of propaganda cannot deceive people. When the war spread to Denmark and Norway, Britain had already seized the Faroe Islands and the Lofoten Islands. Is this also based on international law? We are particularly puzzled. Recently, British troops landed in Iceland. British troops arrived there earlier than British troops arrived in the Netherlands. This point is extremely important, because Iceland is farther from Britain than the Netherlands. British and French troops have rushed to and occupied the Dutch West Indies. At the same time, it is reported that a squadron of their air force has flown to the area. Stalin once said, 'Imperialism wants others to pull chestnuts out of the fire for them.' Judging from the fact that Britain and France attempted to draw the Netherlands and Belgium into the war, his words are true. The Netherlands and Belgium are playthings of the Anglo-French 'protectors.' Their fate has confirmed Molotov's famous saying, 'The rights and interests of small countries are never respected by imperialism.' Some small countries have taken the same steps as their 'protectors,' which is a suicidal policy. They should be able to learn a lesson from this situation. This lesson is extremely important, because Britain and France are trying to create new battlefields. British politicians have recently mentioned the future Mediterranean war. This statement is not accidental. The threat of war has now spread to the Balkan countries and the entire Near East. Therefore, the facts in Norway and Belgium must make all countries that will be drawn into the war by their 'protectors' fearful. They now deeply understand the dangers of participating in the war. Britain and France refused Germany's peace proposals and launched the Second Imperialist War. Their purpose is extremely obvious. For the sake of maintaining peace, the Soviet Union has declared the negative consequences of the spread of the imperialist war. This point is extremely reasonable and accurate."

<h3>The Times of London Comments on the Battle Situation in France</h3>
<p>London. A special dispatch from here says that the "Times" reviewed the battle situation in the Meuse River area and published the following commentary: "From a global perspective, it is not easy for a three-army commander to deal with this kind of offensive, with the enemy holding various extremely fierce weapons and with the determination to burn their boats. Should he wait for the fierce offensive to gradually weaken, or should he counterattack to curb its momentum? In today's war, the decision may have to be made largely based on the air situation. The seriousness of the situation we have encountered in this Meuse River battle cannot be ignored, but there is no need to express disappointment. The united contribution of the British overseas territories to the common effort is already great, and its degree is far beyond what Germany can imagine. At present, the troops of the various autonomous territories have been formed, especially the large-scale Imperial Air Force training program. Once implemented, it will surely prove to have a decisive force. Some people acknowledge that Hitler is eager to invade Scandinavia and the Netherlands and Belgium, in order to make a desperate gamble, which is actually prompted by the hope of winning a victory before the British Empire can make a full contribution. However, his dream will eventually become a bubble due to the courage and perseverance of the Allied forces." The newspaper finally criticized Land Secretary Eden's call for the public to participate in the defense of paratrooper volunteers, saying that the only regrettable thing is that this team was not formed when the war broke out or even earlier. (Reuters telegram, 16th)</p>
<h3>New British Paratrooper Defense Force</h3>
<p>London. According to news last night, the newly formed British paratrooper defense force has reached thousands of people. Since early morning, a large number of men from seventeen to seventy years old have gathered outside various police stations, waiting to register. Because the age stipulated by the government is sixty-five years old, those who exceed this limit are not selected. At present, the War Department has not yet announced how these volunteers should deal with German paratroopers. It is estimated that these volunteers will be divided into old and small teams, led by country gentlemen, chairmen of the British Ex-Servicemen's Association, or hunting managers. When they are off duty, they must return the firearms they carry to the local headquarters and must not take them home. (Reuters dispatch, 16th)</p>
<h3>German Aircraft Groups Invade the Suburbs of Paris, But Do Not Drop Bombs</h3>
<p>Paris. The Paris "Evening News" recently reported that a group of German reconnaissance planes invaded the suburbs of Paris this morning, but did not drop bombs. One of them was shot down. (Havas telegram, 16th)</p>
<p>Paris. The captain of the American Volunteer Ambulance Corps,賴納, recently told a Havas reporter that five ambulances from the team were bombarded by German planes directing their country's artillery on the front lines of northeastern France. Two of them have been completely destroyed. These ambulances all have the American flag and the Red Cross symbol painted on them. (Havas telegram, 16th)</p>
<h3>Germany Adopts Traditional Strategy, Schlieffen Plan, "Strengthen the Right Wing"</h3>
<p>Swiss Capital. The Berlin radio station recently sent out a message at 7:00 p.m. today, roughly saying that the "blitzkrieg" used by Germany this time is part of the famous Schlieffen Plan. The late famous general Moltke had once tried to use it in 1914, but it failed at the time. It is investigated that this plan was deliberately formulated by the late Chief of General Staff General Schlieffen, who spent eight years before the outbreak of the European War. According to this plan, the German army should break into French territory through Belgium. Its main principle is to use the right wing of the German army as the basis for the attack, so it must be made strong and powerful. General Schlieffen would have a "strengthen the right wing" will when he passed away. The German military authorities have always regarded this saying as a golden rule. This time, the right wing has passed through the Netherlands and the North Sea from Belgium, and has extended to Norway. Its strength can be known. (Havas telegram, 15th)</p>
<h3>The New British Cabinet Opens a Ministry of Petroleum, With Lloyd George as Minister</h3>
<p>London. Another batch of newly appointed cabinet members was announced last night. Because the responsibilities for coal and oil are becoming increasingly important, the Ministry of Petroleum was opened at the time, with Lloyd George as the Minister, and separated from the Ministry of Mines. The leader of the cabinet members in the House of Lords will be held by郝德傑. It is investigated that the new government has 29 members of the Conservative Party, 11 members of the Labor Party, 4 members of the Simon-Pai Liberal Party, 3 members of the opposition Liberal Party, 1 member of the National Labor Party, and 7 national representatives, such as漢基 and 李滋. What is noticeable that the former cabinet members who have not received new positions are Minister of Aviation賀爾, Minister of Indian and Burmese Affairs 塞特倫, and President of the Privy Council 史丹賀浦.

<h3>Churchill's Message to the Navy</h3>
<p>London. Prime Minister and Minister of Defense Churchill recently issued a message to all naval officers and soldiers and merchant sailors, roughly saying that in the past eight months, you have done your best for the country. I would like to take the opportunity of leaving the Admiralty to express my sincere gratitude to all officers and soldiers and sailors. Although I have left office, my successor, Mr. Alexander, is originally a prominent figure in the political world. It can be said that he is deeply happy to have found a good person. In the future, in the capacity of Prime Minister and Minister of Defense, I will still pay close attention to your interests. (Havas telegram, 16th)</p>
<h3>German Overseas Interests Entrusted to Neutral Countries for Management</h3>
<p>Berlin. According to the official declaration here, after the outbreak of the war, Germany entrusted its interests in enemy countries to Sweden, Switzerland, Spain, and Iran for management. The details are as follows: (1) France and its colonies, except Morocco, Syria, and Lebanon (Sweden); (2) Morocco, Tangier (Spain); (3) Syria and Lebanon (Switzerland); (4) the British Empire, except South Africa, North and South Rhodesia, Hong Kong, the Straits, colonies, Palestine, Transjordan, and the Nigeria-Cameron trust territory (Switzerland); (5) South Africa and North and South Rhodesia (Spain); (6) Palestine and Transjordan (Spain); (7) Egypt (Sweden); (8) Iraq (Iran); (9) Belgium (Spain); (10) the Netherlands (Switzerland).

<p>London. The government has issued a warning that the law prohibiting trade with the enemy is now being implemented in the Netherlands (except for the province of Zeeland). This law will not take effect in the various overseas territories of the Netherlands as long as the various trades do not involve the mainland of the Netherlands. (Reuters telegram, 16th)</p>
<h3>The League of Nations Prepares to Move to Lisbon</h3>
<p>Geneva. This morning, the French countryside around Lake Geneva heard the sound of air raid alarms, but whether German planes were found or not is unknown. The particularly sharp sound of the alarm entered here very clearly. At the same time, the International League of Nations here, fearing that the German army would invade Switzerland, has prepared to move away from Geneva today. It is learned that the League of Nations' headquarter will be set up in Lisbon, Portugal, and it is also heard that the important documents of the League of Nations have been moved out of Geneva. The staff of the League of Nations has prepared to clear up all the affairs of the Association, and has agitated various people related to the Association, telling them to stop the contract within 24 hours and receive the termination fee.

<h3>With Italy About to Join the War, the U.S. President Re-Appeals for Peace: Cables the Italian Prime Minister to Prevent the Expansion of the European War; Allied Fleets Sail into the Mediterranean for Exercises</h3>
<p>Washington. According to the "New York Times," President Roosevelt received a "shocking report on the 14th of this month, learning that Italy has the possibility of joining the war." He immediately convened State Department authorities to hold a meeting and sent a cable to Italian Prime Minister Mussolini at 2:00 a.m. on the 15th (Washington time), appealing for peace, which was forwarded by the U.S. Ambassador to Italy, Phillips. (Havas urgent telegram, 16th)</p>
<p>New York. According to the "New York Times," reliable sources revealed that President Roosevelt yesterday again made a final appeal to Italian Prime Minister Mussolini through the U.S. Ambassador to Italy to prevent the expansion of the war. The newspaper believes that this appeal expresses President Roosevelt's concern about the expansion of the European war and his hope that Mussolini will use his influence to stop it. Roosevelt's appeal is tantamount to asking the Italian government to avoid participating in the European war. Washington officials neither deny nor confirm this step. The newspaper believes that this appeal is a continuation of President Roosevelt's exchange of views with European dignitaries in the past two years. (Haitongshe telegram, 16th)</p>
<p>Rome. U.S. President Roosevelt's letter requesting Italian Prime Minister Mussolini not to expand the war is said to have little effect by informed sources here.

(United Press telegram, 16th)</p>
<p>London. The rumor that Italy will soon join the war has become increasingly clamorous because of the news about the talks between the U.S. Ambassador to Italy and the Italian Foreign Minister, which was spread by the major embassies of neutral countries. The news said that the U.S. Ambassador had offered the Italian Foreign Minister a plan that would be conducive to U.S.-Italian trade, but the Italian Foreign Minister said that Italy probably does not need such plans. Then the U.S. Ambassador asked the Italian Foreign Minister what exactly was the meaning of this reply. The Italian Foreign Minister replied, "You can infer it as anything you think it is."

<p>London. After the British and French Mediterranean fleets returned to Alexandria, Egypt, two weeks ago, they held their first exercise today. The sound of artillery fire along the Egyptian coast was loud and clear. (Havas telegram, 16th) The Italian newspapers in Rome all regard the sudden departure of the British and French fleets from Alexandria, Egypt, as "mysterious," but they did not comment much on it. At the same time, they also published news saying that the Egyptian government has taken various preventive measures in the area near the Italian Libyan border. (Havas telegram, 16th)</p>

All American expatriates residing in southwestern Europe should withdraw immediately and return to their country as soon as possible via the ports of Buto or Spain and Portugal.

<h3>Italy's Attitude Forces Anxiety in Southern Countries: Reportedly, an Italian Plane Was Shot Down Near奥古林</h3>
<p>Southern Slavic Capital. Although Italy has not yet made a decision on its attitude, its aggressive posture has made Yugoslavia deeply uneasy. The southern government has therefore taken various measures in national defense. Because the air defense aspect is the most threatened, a special school has been opened in the capital to train paratrooper teams, and the training of flight personnel has been intensified. Air Force reservists have also been conscripted into the army. The country's planes are flying over the capital day and night. (Havas telegram, 15th)</p>
<p>Southern Slavic Capital.

<h3>U.S. Senate to Pass the Vinson Big Navy Bill: Walsh Strongly Advocates Fortifying Guam, Enhancing Existing Naval Bases</h3>
<p>Washington. When Senate Naval Committee Chairman Walsh made a formal report yesterday, he requested the passage of the Vinson Navy Bill, changing the committee's previous position, and requested that Guam be rebuilt as an outpost for air force and submarines. However, Walsh said, "We should do our best to maintain peace in the Far East, because if we cannot but go to war, we can defeat Japan, but the cost will be very huge. At present, the United States does lack a naval base in that place (referring to Guam). In the event of a Far East war, we can only join forces with Britain, France, and the Netherlands." Walsh also said that the Air Force, without the mutual assistance of naval warships, is not enough to prevent the enemy from controlling the sea. He said, "The armies of Europe and Asia have no bases in the Western Hemisphere, so they are not enough to threaten us. In the Pacific, we should maintain an unparalleled fleet. The air force base in Hawaii, and build air force and submarine bases in Alaska,色加, and哥特. Build submarine bases in the remote islands of華克, 約翰遜, 巴爾米拉, and整登 in the Central Pacific. We should use Guam as the chain of the national defense plan, develop the island's harbor, maintain a submarine combat team, and a long-range cruise aircraft team. Therefore, it can be used as an outpost sea electric base to obtain important information for our country's fleet defense line." It is investigated that the Vinson Navy Bill includes the construction of multiple battleships, super dreadnoughts (45,000 tons), and 352 naval aircraft, with a total cost of久6.772.878 U.S. dollars. This bill was passed in the House of Representatives last month, and it is believed that it can be passed in the Senate without major opposition, due to the recent new situation in the European war. Germany's invasion of the Netherlands and Belgium is believed to have eliminated many opposing debates on expanding the navy. (United Press telegram, 16th)</p>
<p>Washington. The Senate Naval Committee recently issued a report supporting the suggestion of a 11% increase in the navy, and advocating for the modernization of air force, naval, and submarine bases on both the Atlantic and Pacific coasts. The report stated that serious consideration should be given to the question of acquiring sites in the Caribbean within the possible scope and adding naval bases. A naval aviation squadron base in the southeastern corner of the Caribbean will certainly increase the safety of the region and strengthen the ability of the U.S. fleet to protect the integrity of the Monroe Doctrine. The Senate Naval Committee has resolved that if the United States is subjected to any kind of direct attack, unless it is adequately dealt with by the latest-style naval and air forces, the United States is impenetrable.

<h3>American Officials and Public United in Supporting Military Expansion: Retired Aviation Personnel to be Recalled for Service</h3>
<p>New York - Secretary of War Woodring also, in light of the development of the European war, is calling for increased American preparedness, saying that the time when "we must spend vast sums to defend this great democracy" is fast approaching. Today, all newspapers are using large headlines to loudly proclaim that America must have a fully sufficient navy and a fully effective army. (16th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>New York - Major General Drum, commander of the U.S. Second Army Area, declared that the United States must establish an army of one million men, equipped with new-style armaments. He advocates establishing a standing army of 150,000 men, a national guard of 500,000 men, and reserves equipped with 250,000 men. Democratic Senator Townsend is asking Congress to authorize the government to purchase 500 million gold dollars' worth of military raw materials that America lacks. Republican Senator Barbour is advocating increasing the navy by 50%, doubling the standing army, and establishing "the world's largest air force," increasing aircraft industry production to 100,000 aircraft per year. Senator Russell is requesting increasing the current air force of 4,000 aircraft to 15,000 aircraft. Congress is enthusiastically supporting the military expansion plan, and President Roosevelt's proposal to increase military spending should not encounter difficulties. (16th Haitong dispatch)</p>

<h3>U.S. Naval Main Force in the Pacific, Causing Unease in Japan, Criticizing U.S. Expansion Plan</h3>
<p>Hong Kong - Tokyo report: A spokesman for the Japanese Navy Ministry, when meeting with the press today, was asked about the whereabouts of the main force of the U.S. Navy. The spokesman said that the main force of the U.S. Navy is undoubtedly in the Pacific. The current international situation is becoming increasingly complex, and rumors are rife, such as the rumor that the U.S. Navy has moved from Hawaii to Manila, which is one example. We hope that both sides can maintain a calm attitude. (16th dispatch)</p>
<p>Tokyo - A spokesman claimed that the U.S. Navy's 11% expansion plan "will be publicly criticized, as its purpose is to attack other countries." He considered the reason given by the U.S. Senate Naval Affairs Committee for the need for an "unbreakable fleet" to avoid war with Japan to be insufficient. "If the United States continues to build a larger navy, then Japan will also follow suit," he said, "the reason for this is to guard against Germany taking over Europe."

<h3>Prime Minister Yonai to Announce Japan's Attitude Towards the Dutch East Indies; Reports of British Plainclothes Soldiers Entering the Dutch East Indies: London Claims Entirely Fictitious</h3>
<p>Tokyo - Japanese Prime Minister Admiral Mitsumasa Yonai plans to issue a statement today summarizing the Japanese government's position on the new situation in the Dutch East Indies after German troops occupied most of the Netherlands. Japanese newspapers today continue to express concern for maintaining the status quo of the Dutch East Indies. Newspapers here unanimously express that the German invasion of the Netherlands increases America's responsibility to maintain the status quo of the East Indies. "The Japan Times" predicts whether the Netherlands will allow Allied troops to land in the East Indies, following the example of the West Indies. The newspaper stated, "Our policy is not to get involved in the vortex of the European war. We make it clear to people around the world that Japan's adherence to this policy will be universally beneficial. Therefore, we do not want to provoke anyone. What we always bear in mind is to request the relevant powers not to take actions that could disrupt security there. We do not want to be drawn into the vortex of war. We request that other countries not interfere in the East Indies, so that our purpose can be achieved." The "Hochi Shimbun" criticized the government's attitude towards the Dutch East Indies, warning that the increasing anti-Japanese sentiment in the Dutch East Indies would lead to serious repercussions and would have a fatal impact on Japan's work of "building a new order in East Asia." (16th United Press dispatch)</p>
<p>Tokyo - Rear Admiral Kanazawa, spokesman for the Japanese Navy, told reporters today that the United Kingdom, France, the United States, and the Netherlands have all guaranteed to maintain the status quo of the Dutch East Indies. Diplomatically speaking, the Dutch East Indies issue has come to an end. Kanazawa stated that, although the Japanese Navy expresses concern about whether these countries will keep their promises, the East Indies are Japan's second or third supplier of oil, so they are very important to Japan. (16th United Press dispatch)</p>
<p>London - A special dispatch from here today says that a German news report is circulating widely in Japan, saying that a large number of British travelers from Malaysia have recently landed in the Dutch East Indies. It is claimed that these travelers are all British soldiers, including many officers, and are of the same nature as the German travelers who served as advance guards before the German invasion of Norway. Responsible parties here declare that this German rumor is entirely fictitious, and that no British soldiers, whether in uniform or in plainclothes, are landing or have landed anywhere in the Dutch East Indies.

<h3>Italy's Dangerous Situation</h3>
<p>Anti-British and anti-French sentiment in Italy has been growing recently, and various rumors are flying, mostly speculating about what actions the country will take to aid Germany. However, keen observers still believe that Italy is currently unable to engage in large-scale war.</p>
<p>Although Italy has an army of one million men, it lacks sufficient reserves of military equipment and raw materials. Cotton stockpiles are limited, and there is a shortage of various major metals. The accumulated wheat is, at most, enough for one year's use.</p>
<p>The coal problem is particularly serious. In wartime, Italy needs 12 million to 14 million tons of coal per year, and in peacetime, it needs 6 million to 8 million tons per year. This coal was usually supplied largely by Germany and Poland, and about one-quarter was supplied by the United Kingdom. Because ship transportation costs are lower than train transportation, most of this coal is transported by sea. The German sources have now been cut off by the British and French blockade. Resupply from the United Kingdom is also difficult, partly because Italy does not have foreign exchange to pay for the goods, and partly because the United Kingdom requires payment in military equipment if there is no cash, which Mussolini is naturally unwilling to accept easily to avoid offending Germany.</p>
<p>Germany is now allowing one million tons of coal to be transported to Italy by train each month, with 65 trains per day, directly from three German main lines, and indirectly from four railways in Switzerland and Yugoslavia, responsible for transportation. Although this method is theoretically possible, it is feared that it will be difficult in practice.</p>
<p>The Italian authorities complain greatly that the British blockade hinders Italy's access to raw materials. The British side mocks that it has not hindered Italy from obtaining the metals and other raw materials it usually needs, but it does not allow Italy to obtain excessive raw materials to prevent resupply to Germany. In addition, many Italian ships are being detained in Gibraltar, and ships traveling to and from ports in the Mediterranean, which normally take three days, now take as long as ten days. Italy needs to import various raw materials from overseas, and this situation will naturally make Italy extremely resentful.</p>
<p>Italy's finances are very tight. Since the start of the war, the standard of living of the people has increased by at least 20%. Although the authorities have tried to suppress wages to prevent inflation, they have failed. The dissatisfaction of the working class is something that even the dictatorial government cannot ignore. Wages in Italy have increased by 16%, but they still cannot keep up with the increase in the cost of living.</p>
<p>Taxes in Italy are also very harsh. Since 1937, three major taxes have been increased: a land tax, a capital tax on joint-stock companies, and a capital tax on general stores. Recently, a business tax has also been levied. Although the dictatorial state has methods of taxation that democratic countries do not use, even if Italian finances have exhausted all possible methods of extraction, it cannot be said that there are no other ways to increase revenue.</p>
<p>If Italy can strictly abide by its neutral status, and if other countries can generously respect it, the country's industrial and commercial prospects are very promising. It can use new factory equipment to increase production, on the one hand, to replace the belligerent countries and supply the world market, and on the other hand, it still has the surplus capacity to undertake orders from the belligerent countries, thereby adjusting unfavorable exchange rates.</p>
<p>However, strictly speaking, Italy is not a neutral country, and neither Germany nor Britain and France are willing for Italy to obtain any privileges that are beneficial to the enemy. Although factories in northern Italy are busy manufacturing French orders, France only allows limited raw materials to be transported to Italy. Italian factories use other people's raw materials to manufacture goods, hand them over immediately, and there is no significant profit to be made.</p>
<p>Italy has a large workforce. The number of men aged 20 to 55 is 2 million more than in France, while the populations of the two countries are equal. Italy claims to be able to mobilize 8 million people, but it is certain that the armed equipment will be insufficient; even with the equipment of Italy's current active army of one million men, it is still insufficient. Last autumn, Mussolini changed the army generals because the army's equipment was insufficient. Italy must station large armies in Abyssinia and Albania. Its fatal weakness is Abyssinia. If Italy goes to war with Britain and France, the yet-to-be-conquered Abyssinia, located between Egypt and French Somaliland, is really in danger of being attacked from both sides.</p>
<p>People in Rome say that Mussolini is pro-German, but in reality, what Mussolini and the general Italian public support is Italy, Fascism, and Mussolini. The biggest reason for Mussolini's collusion with Germany is probably that he initially believed that the German-Italian alliance could guarantee peace. If Mussolini continues to collude with Germany, it may be because he sees Germany as powerful and anticipates that Germany can win, or it may be to maintain his own prestige. From another perspective, if Mussolini actively participates in the war and aids Germany, then Italy will become a battlefield and pay the highest price.</p>
<p>Italy's industrial areas are concentrated around Milan and Turin in the north, close to the French border, making them more vulnerable to attack than the industrial areas of any other major power. This is naturally one reason why 99% of Italian industry is vehemently opposed to participating in the war.</p>
<p>However, Italy's restraining power is great. It possesses a powerful submarine fleet, which is enough to cause great difficulties for Britain and France in the Mediterranean. When Germany takes the offensive, Italy's troops on the northwestern border, even if they do not move, can at least restrain a portion of the Allied forces. Italy's control of the Adriatic Sea is enough to hinder the British blockade of Germany; the transportation of goods from the Balkan Peninsula to Germany via the Adriatic Sea is a major gap in the British blockade line. Italy has a great deal of influence in the Balkan Peninsula. Its relationship with Hungary has reached the extent of an alliance, and it can exert pressure on Romania through Hungary. Italy and Hungary can also jointly oppress Yugoslavia. Italy is currently colluding with Germany to undermine British and French influence in the Balkans.</p>
<p>In short, Italy is in a dangerous position, playing a dangerous game. The powerful Allied countries to the north can exert pressure on it from the land, and the British and French navies can pursue it at sea. For sixteen years, the people of Italy have made huge sacrifices in the process of domestic transformation and conquering land abroad, and they are now tired of war and praying for peace. They have engaged in reconstruction in most of their country, and they have conquered Abyssinia and Albania, and they have also fought in Spain for Fascism. Now they need to rest.

<h3>At Xue Tao Well, a Famous Courtesan of the Tang Dynasty: Jin River's Flow Interrupted, Gold Digging Continues; Zhang Xianzhong Hid Tens of Thousands of Gold Treasures Under the Jin River; Scientific Methods Being Used to Excavate at Wangjiang Tower</h3>
<p>News of the discovery of Han tombs and their excavation near Chongqing Hangxin and Jiangbei near Chongqing is currently bustling, while the Jin River gold digging project in Chengdu, which was suspended for ten months and once caused a widespread sensation, is now continuing.</p>
<p>"Stone cow faces a drum, fifteen million silver coins. Whoever can understand it can 'buy up the entire Chengdu Prefecture.'" This folk saying has been circulating for a long time. Before Zhang Xianzhong fled to northern Sichuan, he cast gold and silver from the Shu Palace into ingots and other treasures. He interrupted the river's flow, drilled deep holes to hide them, and killed all the overseeing craftsmen to prevent later generations from excavating them. Unofficial histories and Chen Shaoxiang of Renshou's *Juanbi Lu* both contain such records. Old archives from the Sichuan Governor and Provincial Commissioner offices of the late Qing Dynasty also contain a memorial from Sichuan Governor-General Sun Shiyi requesting permission to open the river treasure.</p>
<p>The rumor of Zhang Xianzhong interrupting the river to sink gold is likely not without cause. However, the exact location of the river treasure has never been definitively recorded, nor has anyone ever discovered it.</p>
<p>Yang Bailu, the initiator and chairman of the Jin River Gold Panning Company, was instructed by someone early in his life. Later, after careful research, he became convinced that the location of the river treasure must be on the sandbar at Wangjiang Tower in the southeast of the city. Considering that the country urgently needed funds during the war of resistance, he was determined to "rather seek it and not find it than know it and not do it." He gathered friends, obtained government approval, and resolutely began excavation on March 1st of last spring. After more than two months of construction, work was suspended due to rising water. Although many signs were discovered during this period, making people more convinced that the records and ballads were not without reason, it was ultimately regrettable that there was a lack of scientific proof.</p>
<p>To solve this problem, the company spared no expense in hiring experts to manufacture a wireless gold detector. After more than a dozen tests, the results confirmed that there was indeed a metallic response, and the will to dig for gold became even stronger.</p>
<p>In today's era of scientific advancement, everything is inseparable from science. Last spring's construction used traditional methods. Both excavation and drainage were difficult. This year's continued excavation has been changed to scientific methods, such as machine drainage and reinforced concrete bucket caisson excavation. The mysterious and wealthy interest of the river treasure is being continued to be excavated in a scientific atmosphere.</p>
<p>Historical Research</p>
<p>Who pointed out the secret of the river treasure to Yang Bailu, the initiator of the river treasure development? What historical research did the person who pointed it out have?</p>
<p>Jiang Xizeng, courtesy name Huanzhuang, a candidate for officialdom of the late Qing Dynasty, was from Anhui and served as an official in Sichuan for many years. He was upright and unyielding. After the 1911 Revolution, political affairs changed, and he planned to return home. Before leaving, he specially prepared a grand farewell banquet and solemnly told Yang Bailu about the matter of the bandit Zhang Xianzhong hiding treasures in the Jin River in the early Qing Dynasty.</p>
<p>There are many records of treasure hiding in unofficial histories. According to Chen Shaoxiang of Renshou's *Juanbi Lu*, "After Zhang Xianzhong was defeated by Yang Zhan at Jiangkou, he decided to flee to northern Sichuan. He used methods to move the remaining gold and silver ingots and treasures from the Shu Palace to the Jin River. He dried up its flow, drilled several holes, filled them, covered them with wood and stone, and killed all the overseeing craftsmen to prevent people from excavating them," which is the same as that recorded in the *Shubi*, and both are very detailed. "In the old archives of the Governor and Provincial Commissioner offices, it is recorded that in the sixth year of Qianlong, Sichuan Governor-General Sun Shiyi requested permission to open the river treasure. At that time, the country was wealthy and the people were prosperous, and Emperor Gaozong of Qing believed that the matter was not related to the political system and ordered the dismissal of his proposal. Later, Chen Taichu, a Hanlin scholar from Sichuan, requested the Military Affairs Department to submit a memorial on his behalf, requesting permission to open the river treasure and submitted a pledge, but it was not approved. During the Daoguang, Xianfeng, Tongzhi, and Guangxu reigns, the national treasury became increasingly depleted. Although there were imperial edicts ordering the Sichuan Governor-General to investigate the river treasure based on the memorials of Sun Shiyi and Chen Taichu, unfortunately, the phrase 'Jin River' was too broad, and those who were in charge of the matter lacked research on this matter and were mostly at a loss, resulting in them not being able to determine the exact location of the river treasure and failing to achieve their goal."</p>
<p>Jiang Xizeng's research concluded that Zhang Xianzhong fled from Chengdu to northern Sichuan on August 16th, so the river treasure must have been before August 16th. At that time, the river water was high, and holes could not be drilled without interrupting the flow. Interruption of the flow would require opening a branch river, and opening a branch river would require a large bay. The sections of the Jin River near Chengdu that have large bays and branch rivers are usually where the river treasure is located. After on-site investigation along the river, he was convinced that the treasure hiding place must be the sandbar behind Wangjiang Tower.</p>
<p>Since receiving instructions, Yang Bailu has devoted himself to research. Ultimately, due to the remoteness of the past and the passage of time, he was deeply unsure and could not avoid being criticized for being meddlesome. Therefore, he had been silent for many years and had not shown it to others.</p>
<p>Preparation Process</p>
<p>With the outbreak of the War of Resistance and the need for funds in the national treasury, Yang Bailu felt that the time had come, so he joined forces with Ma Kunshan and Shi Wei to initiate the treasure digging. At that time, although some friends tried to dissuade them, Yang and Ma were not moved and directly submitted a request to the National Government for filing and approval to excavate. They also generously stated in the submission, "Rather seek it and not find it than know it and not do it. If the treasure is successfully excavated, they are willing to contribute 80% of the silver to the country." The company name was approved by the government as "Jin River Gold Panning Company." The Sichuan Provincial Government also appointed Yang and Ma as special commissioners for gold panning.</p>
<p>After the company's filing procedures were perfected, the initiators publicly solicited shares in the spring of the 28th year. Initially, there were twenty shares, and a board of directors was established. Yang Bailu, Ma Kunshan, Wu Yihou, Luo Zunan, Zhang Xiehua, Xing Shufeng, Fan Kongjia, Ji Chongshu, and Wen Chao were appointed as directors, with Yang Bailu serving as chairman and Ma Kunshan as manager.</p>
<p>After the establishment of the board of directors, an engineering office was set up in Wangjiang Tower, with Wu Yihou as manager, and Yang Xiehua, Xing Shufeng, and Luo Zunan responsible for general affairs, design, and engineering, respectively. Xiong Mingxuan was hired as the chief engineer to recruit workers for panning and excavation. On March 1st, exploration began, and the construction site was on the sand pile in the middle of the river at Wangjiang Tower.</p>
<p>Seven Signs</p>
<p>After starting work on March 1st, they first began digging a rectangular pit ten zhang long and one zhang wide in the middle of the river sand pile. After five days of construction, they dug more than one zhang deep, and the bottom became flooded. The deeper it got, the larger the flood. They used four traditional waterwheels to drain the water, and the work barely progressed. Continuing for three more days, a hundred workers were added to dig down, reaching a depth of one zhang and eight chi. The bottom was still sand, stone, and mud, with no abnormalities. It was decided to add a gasoline water pump for drainage. At the same time, more places were explored. On March 12th, they dug in from the right side of the sand pile, about four chi from the water surface, and found countless dry bones and four human heads. Separated by a chi or so, it was expected that the dry bones were not washed in by the river water. According to the examination of most experts, the dry bones were not from the last one or two hundred years, apparently the remains of stonemasons and porters killed by Zhang Xianzhong on that day. This is the first sign.</p>
<p>At the same time, a layer of blood-soaked sand and stone was also dug up, five or six cun thick, with a considerable area. After research by most experts, it was believed that this blood-soaked sand and stone was indeed the impregnation of human blood. It was confirmed by Chen Shaoxiang's *Juanbi Lu*, which said, "Covered with wood and stone, and killed all the overseers on top of it." It was also confirmed by Lou Dong Shen Xunwei's *Shu Nan Lu*, which said, "He gathered gold and silver, used more than a thousand people to transport it to the river bank, and it was completed in three months. He made a large hole at the bottom of the river, threw in gold and silver, and killed the porters on top of it, then covered it with soil and restored the river flow to its original course." According to the above two paragraphs, it is enough to prove that the blood-soaked sand and stone is the bloodstain of the overseers and porters killed by Zhang Xianzhong. This is the second sign. At that time, the company thought that the above two signs were indeed the remains and bloodstains of the overseers and porters killed by Zhang Xianzhong, and that there must be stone bars below. Sure enough, on the afternoon of the 13th, about two chi below the blood-soaked sand and stone and rotten human bones, several red stone bars were dug up, arranged horizontally across the river. There was tung oil lime at the junction of the front, back, left, and right. When washed with water, one stone had the character "Zhang" engraved on it. Digging along the stone, stone bars appeared one after another, all arranged leaning on the right bank, quite like artificial constructions. After four days of intensive work, a total of ninety-two stone bars were dug out, many of which were engraved with characters such as "Tian," "Si," "Shang," "Xia," "Yi," "Liang," etc. Stone bars engraved with the character "Dong" were dug up in the east, and stone bars engraved with the character "Bei" were dug up in the north. Only the characters "Xi" and "Nan" have not yet been dug up. Therefore, it can be seen that the river treasure originally had a boundary. There was also a stone bar with the character "Ri Yi" engraved on it, which could not be clearly distinguished. According to a certain scholar, the character "Ri Yi" is the killing symbol on Zhang Xianzhong's Seven Killing Stele. According to the *Shu Guizhen*, Xian bandit gathered all the students and people with a silver ingot, ordered them to put it on their heads, enter from the west and exit from the east, kill one person, take one treasure, and laughed and said, "Is it a waste of your head? Killing you is still mine." The Xian bandit considered play like a child. "(Yi)" is the silver ingot, and the line in the circle is the killing knife. This is the killing symbol, which is not without reason.</p>
<p>After taking out the stone bars, continue to dig deeper. About two chi below the stone bars, a three-in-one layer of tung oil lime and sand and stone was found. After taking out the three-in-one layer, countless rotten black water was found. Here, two more signs were obtained. The fifth sign was a bit mysterious. On the night of April 8th, white light suddenly appeared around the project, like moonlight, but brighter than moonlight, and it did not disappear for more than ten minutes. When the white light appeared, supervisor Xie Guangqian saw it with his own eyes and was very surprised. There was no moon in the sky, where did the moonlight come from? The light was a large circle, and there was no light outside the country. He immediately woke up the driver Li Zhongyi to come and see, and he also felt it was a bit strange. At the same time, four water workers also saw it. Two hours before Guangqian, a river bank collapse sound suddenly came from the trench, and the drivers and water carriers were all taken aback and hurriedly took the lights to see, but there was no damage. According to archaeologists, fine gold contains precious light, and there must be moonlight and white light where silver is stored. If there are no gold, silver, or treasures inside, the outside will never emit light. There must be treasures under the sandbar. This is also an interesting and mysterious sign.</p>
<p>The water was more than two zhang deep, the water color was yellow and black, and the water vapor was very smelly, similar to a dead body. At the same time, a stone cow was dug up on the right side of the project, sleeping in a lying position, its head facing the northeast corner, weighing about several thousand catties. Looking at it, it certainly was not washed in by the flood. It was confirmed by the proverb, "Stone cow faces a stone drum, fifteen million silver coins. Whoever can understand it can 'buy up the entire Chengdu Prefecture.'" He ordered the workers to dig in the northeast corner, where the heads faced each other. Sure enough, a stone was dug up, half round and half square. The plane of the stone protruded left and right and was concave in the middle. There was only this stone nearby, and there was nothing else. But what is the shape of the stone drum? It seems difficult to explain. Perhaps Zhang Xianzhong's thinking was bizarre and he never followed the rules. The shape of the drum is round, but he didn't make it round, so he created this shape. According to the proverb, since "Stone cow faces a stone drum, fifteen million silver coins" has been discovered, it must be here. This is the sixth sign. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Record of the Second National Senior Teacher Education Conference (2)</h3>
<p>— Yi De</p>
<p>Independent establishment of normal college departments of universities year by year; implementation of film education and revision of normal college curriculum</p>
<p>Principals report on school conditions in succession</p>
<p>After the chairman's opening remarks, the reports of various schools followed, one after another like a running account, which can be omitted here. It is a pity that there is not much material on how the various normal colleges solved their difficulties. Now, let's write about some less dry issues below. (1) Huang Yusheng, Dean of the Southwest Associated University Normal College, said that (A) their students really came from all directions, those merged from Yunnan University, those exiled from Peking University and Nankai University, and in-service teachers co-organized with the Yunnan Education Department. (2) Next year, they should recruit 240 people, and there is a problem with the school buildings. (3) Students do things such as raising the flag themselves. (4) Students' reading does not match what the teachers assigned, and they often draw materials from the Life Bookstore. They then selected one hundred of the best books that were extremely right-wing and extremely left-wing to guide students to read outside of class. (5) There are nominally as many as fifty teachers, but in reality, there are only twenty-two, and the rest come from the liberal arts, law, and science departments. Huang has a beard like the American educator Judd and like Courtis. It is said that he loves his wife very much. His wife has now passed away, and since then, he has kept a beard, indicating that he will not marry again. In that case, there is no doubt that he will focus on running the school. Wang Li is the Dean of the Zhejiang University Normal College. This name seems unfamiliar in the education community. He is continuing Zheng Zonghai's position. They pay great attention to the study of history and geography and have specially opened a History and Geography Education Research Office, with Zhang Qiyun in charge of all matters. The history category is divided into general history, national history, local history, biography, wall charts, and the geography category is divided into teaching material research geography series, local geography wall charts. History and geography are the backbone of patriotic education. If it can be organized properly, it will greatly benefit the country.</p>
<p>The Northwest Normal College is nominally independent, but is still subject to the constraints of the Northwest Associated University. Dean Li Zheng said that day that their organization is divided into (1) the Academic Affairs Office, (2) the Student Affairs Office, (3) the General Affairs Office, (4) the Research Institute, and (5) various committees. They have a particularly large number of female students, totaling 108, accounting for one-third. They cannot recruit graduate students, and there are only two. Even if teaching assistants are included, there are only five. If the Ministry of Education has an annual subsidy of 400 yuan per student, it may develop.</p>
<p>Ai Wei, the former Dean of the Central University Normal College, is a loyal and good Mr. Nice Guy. After resigning, Xu Keshi has now succeeded him. Xu is very enthusiastic and has considerable administrative ability. They attach great importance to basic knowledge and have established two committees for Chinese and English. Students who do not meet the standards in Chinese and English cannot graduate. (2) Breaking the students' perception that public funds are something that should be obtained. (3) Setting up a self-made specimen room to train students to make specimens and sell them to middle schools for application. (4) Writing teacher manuals for various subjects in middle schools to provide guidance. Our country's education policy is also placed inside. (5) Collecting materials on difficulties and errors in various places and improving them through lecture meetings and correspondence courses.</p>
<p>Mao Rushu, the only truly independent Normal College Dean, asked for leave this time due to business and was unable to arrive. Therefore, Xie Xunchu, Director of the Preparatory Office of the Women's Normal College, was the rear guard. This Women's Normal College will be able to enroll students and start school next year. The location will not be outside Sichuan. It plans to set up six departments and one course, namely Chinese History Tea, English Department, Home Affairs Department, Education Department, Mathematics Department, Music Department, and Preparatory Education Course. The Preparatory Meeting has not yet been held, but now Qi Guoliang and Tao Xuan are both in Chongqing. The meeting will be convened in the coming days. In the future, the Dean will naturally be Xie Xunchu. He is currently a member of the Ministry of Education.</p>
<p>Minister Chen Bailei Answers Questions</p>
<p>After the reports of various Normal Colleges were completed, Minister Chen Bailei also added several supplementary answers to some questions. (1) Regarding the independent establishment of Normal Colleges, the Ministry of Education plans to gradually transition to an independent model. Hunan and the Northwest have achieved independence. The Women's Normal College being established now can also be independent. As for others who hope to be independent, how about the funding? Please estimate how much more money will be needed. Also, how to prepare teachers? You can first carry out a part of the independence. Such questions may be discussed in advance. (2) The equipment fees for various Normal Colleges have been specially considered by the Executive Yuan, and in the future, funds will be allocated separately for Normal Colleges. Now there are many things that must be done. If it is said that funding cannot be done, then we can only do it first and then find a way. This method is inevitably disadvantageous, but the cause is expanded. Everyone knows your hard work very well. Today, only a win-win solution can build the country, one is to carry out the cause, and the other is to be reasonable. (3) Experimental research in Normal Colleges is also very important. The experimental room of Normal Colleges is equivalent to a factory, and it must be there. However, in this period, there are indeed difficulties. It is not easy to do it in the sound of alarms. It costs eight to ten thousand to move a school. (4) The number of Normal Colleges can be said to be enough at present. There should be nine in the East, South, West, North, Northwest, Southwest, and Central. Adding the Women's Normal College, there should be ten. There are now six, and seven including the Women's Normal College, which can cope with it. In the future, the second step may be to set up a Normal College in each province. (5) The research objects of Normal Colleges vary from place to place. Choose the shortcomings of the local area to study, promote and implement them, and adapt to the time and place. For example, Zhejiang Province is very different in eastern and western Zhejiang, and the personality of the residents is also different. Therefore, Normal Colleges should conduct different researches. If the results of the researches of various Normal Colleges are gathered together, they can form a very complete research room for the country.</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang, at the National Education Conference, advocated production and labor, schools planting their own crops and raising their own livestock, and using the remaining waste as waste, what could be better? Chairman Chiang also advocated benevolence and compassion, and strongly advocated against abusing livestock and damaging flowers and trees. The third thing is the history and geography issue. The formation of a nation depends on history and geography education. Patriotism must be issued from the heart, and the country must be felt to be lovable, and must not be damaged in any way. National consciousness should be developed from history, and the concept of people's livelihood should be developed from geography. If the three subjects of history, geography, and civics are taught well, the Three Principles of the People can be taught without teaching them. These three subjects are the foundation of patriotism. Modern biology is the foundation for building a modern country. Adding Chinese and mathematics can develop the above six subjects.</p>
<p>Our ancestors had their own reasons. They advocated that etiquette, music, archery, charioteering, writing, and mathematics should be related to each other and become a whole. Huier Si said that today's education is like a house that collapsed after an earthquake, only seeing broken pieces and tiles, piles of foreign ash and scattered objects, and not seeing the entire house. The problem is that education is divided into pieces. Today, we should urgently connect them. Divided, they are pieces; combined, they become a set. If each Normal College is responsible for one kind of research and other Normal Colleges help him with research, the combination of research from various places in the future can meet the requirements of the times and break through historical difficulties.</p>
<p>Group Review, Minister Hosts Banquet</p>
<p>April 26th was the second day of the conference. Group reviews were held all day, divided into two groups. The first group was for administrative and general issues, and the second group was for curriculum and moral education. It was a cloudy day with an air raid alarm, and the work was completed with great relief. In the evening, Minister Chen hosted a banquet and held a symposium. Guests and hosts enjoyed themselves.</p>
<p>Final Day, Resolutions Passed on Various Cases</p>
<p>The third day of the conference was the final day. It started at 8:00 in the morning and ended at 7:30 in the evening. The issues discussed and resolved this time were (1) The average number of students in each department and course of Normal Colleges is tentatively set at 30 per grade. The distribution of quotas for each province and city is based on the basic proportion of the population, plus the number of school grades, the number of students in middle schools and vocational schools, and the number of qualified teachers. (2) Provinces and cities should, as soon as possible, send teachers from senior middle schools or equivalent schools who have two or more years of teaching experience and have been inspected and found unqualified to the advanced training classes of various Normal Colleges for one year of training, which can be completed in installments. Tuition and board fees are all waived. Qualified students will be issued a certificate of advanced training for a certain subject in senior middle schools and equivalent schools. This certificate is equivalent to a certificate of qualification for teachers in senior middle schools. (3) Article 1 of the Normal College Regulations is revised to "Normal Colleges aim to cultivate middle school teachers and research educational academics in accordance with the educational purpose and its implementation policy of the Republic of China." (4) Request the Ministry of Education to allocate special funds in the 29th year of the Republic of China to be distributed to various Normal Colleges and affiliated primary and secondary schools for the purpose of purchasing books and instruments. (5) Establish a Department of Physical Education and a Special Course in Physical Education. (6) Normal Colleges should also run social education. (7) Please Education Departments at all levels to earnestly organize teacher qualification examinations. (8) Universities and normal colleges should be established independently year by year. (9) Raising the boarding fees for Normal College students. (10) Increase the number of teaching staff in various departments of Normal Colleges. (11) Increase the salaries of Normal College students. (12) Organize in-service teacher training in middle schools. (13) Promulgate measures for the attached middle schools of Normal Colleges and raise the standards of teacher funding and equipment, and establish policy guidelines. (14) Implement film education. (15) When necessary, a five-year special course may be set up to recruit junior high school graduates. (16) The length of study for military special courses may be changed to three years. (17) Pay attention to the needs of national education teachers and increase the number of normal colleges. (18) Design the national music teacher training program. These proposals all belong to administrative and general issues.</p>
<p>Regarding curriculum and moral education issues, they are (1) Revise the Normal College curriculum and convene a curriculum meeting as soon as possible. (2) The departments of education and civics education can set up auxiliary departments. (3) Leave room for flexibility in required courses. (4) The Three Principles of the People, physical education, military training, and music are all given credits. (5) Appropriately reduce the number of credits for basic subjects. (6) Social science is changed to elective. (7) The introduction to education is noted to include political affairs and the development of Chinese education. (8) Educational psychology includes educational testing and statistics. (9) The English department and English-related courses can use English textbooks. (10) Build family-style dormitories to facilitate the tutor system. (11) Independent schools are requested to be exempted from setting up chief tutors. (12) Normal College graduates who have served for more than six years and apply for Normal College may use introduction to education instead of English, and take remedial English after entering school. (13) Formulate the research work of Normal Colleges. (14) Draft the outlines of various subjects in the Department of Physical Education and edit textbooks and reference books. (End)</p>

<h3>Western Football Club Abuses High-Pressure Tactics; Lido Suffers Unprecedented Punishment; Originates from Charity Match and Refusal to Protest; Absurd Measures Virtually Alienate Chinese</h3>
<p>The Lido Football Team, since its establishment, has had outstanding achievements. In the short period of two years, it has twice won the史盃 championship and collected small trophies. It has not only won supreme honor for us Chinese but also contributed a lot to charity. Even for the Western Club, it has increased its huge income. Unexpectedly, the Western Club, in order to maintain its traditional high-pressure tactics, frequently put pressure on the Chinese team. In the international match against Portugal, it severely warned Lido team captain Sun Jinshun with unfounded penalties, and at the same time, punished Meng Xiliang by suspending his right to participate in the remaining games of this season. Unexpectedly, the remaining anger has not subsided, and after the football season has ended, it used the excuse that the penalty period of Lido players Meng Yiliang and Jiang Zhaoxiang had not expired when they participated in the Chinese-French charity match, and severely punished Lido again. In addition to severely sentencing Meng and Jiang, they were suspended from participating in the 1940-41 season (i.e., next season). In addition, the Hong Kong and Tianjin Football Associations were notified that Meng and Jiang were not allowed to participate. At the same time, the Lido Sports Association was fined 50 yuan. If it is not paid, Lido will be suspended from participating in the Shanghai Football League or Cup in the 1940-41 season. After receiving this bizarre verdict on the 16th of last month, the Lido authorities protested within the time limit in accordance with the regulations. The Western Club did not convene the Executive Committee to discuss it and rejected it directly. When Lido submitted the reasons for the protest to the Appeals Committee again, it received a reply from the Western Club the day before yesterday, saying that it was overdue and rejected all appeals. According to the cause of this matter, it was purely because Meng and Jiang attended the Chinese-French charity football match held in Yiyuan on the 13th of last month. At that time, the football season had already ended (according to the Western League regulations, the football season must end within the second week of April), then Meng and Jiang's football imprisonment had ended long ago. At the same time, this Chinese-French charity match was purely initiated by the French Chamber of Commerce and invited Lido to co-host it, which was not within the scope of the Western League. Even if it cannot be weighed outside the law, it should be forgiven because the matter belongs to charity. When the Hangzhou Municipal Construction Games were held in 1931, the Western Club used Chen Zhenhe, whose football imprisonment had not expired. Why did it go back on its word and go so far? This is tantamount to throwing a bomb at our Chinese football team and alienating ourselves from our Chinese.</p>

<h3>Hualian Track and Field Team Tests, Wang Guan Creates Excellent Records, One Mile Result Four Minutes Twenty-Three Seconds, Today's Race Continues</h3>
<p>The Hualian Track and Field Team held a general performance test at Jinke Middle School at 6:30 yesterday morning. All items were track events. Due to the rescheduling, many people were absent. Only more than 30 people attended. The 440-yard low hurdles were not held due to lack of participants. Among the results of each item, the one mile was the most impressive. Wang Zhenglin and Guan Youwen competed fiercely. Wang reached the finish line first, with a result of four minutes and twenty-three seconds.

<h3>Finance Foreign Exchange Fluctuations Unpredictable; Early Morning Buying Spree Engulfs, Buyers Disappear; Settlement Suddenly Turns Eager, Price Tightens Sharply Again</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market situation: HSBC's listing continued to rise for exchange rates, the US exchange rate was listed at a loose 4.375, the British exchange rate was unchanged, and the internal market situation was quite chaotic, with ups and downs changing several times a day. The large drop was followed by a large tightening. Initially, Chinese and Western speculators unanimously dumped, and the US-Japan line followed suit with heavy sales. Banks, except for British merchants, had little appetite. The price dropped sharply. The shilling broke through the 4 office to the outside, reaching 4 office 0.09375, and the US exchange rate also rose to 5 yuan 0.625. Unexpectedly, HSBC suddenly came up with a fierce increase of tens of thousands of US dollars, and Mobil Oil and tobacco companies had huge settlements. Hong Kong speculators called to suck it up, and Chinese speculators also switched from selling to sucking it up. The market suddenly tightened. In the afternoon, it softened to a British exchange rate of only 3 office 875 and a US dollar of 5 yuan 0.125. It was heard that the bank had done it against each other. Later, there was news that Italy had participated in the war. British merchants, HSBC, and others suddenly dumped, and a certain daily line also sold. The tightening stopped and loosened again. Midway through, the father's absorption by a certain bank slightly softened. Finally, in the selling spree of the daily line selling tens of thousands of US dollars in cash, it loosened again. At the close, the shilling was 3 office 0.9375, and the US dollar was 5 yuan 0.3125. The British tightened 0.03125, the US was flat, and futures tightened sharply across the board. The swap reappeared and left, and trading became extremely prosperous.</p>
<p>HSBC enters more than 100,000 US dollars in US exchange rate</p>
<p>At the beginning of the morning, the London big stick, both near and far futures, rose by 5.625. The New York silver price was still flat, the London gold price was fixed, the exchange rate between the British and the US was unchanged, and the exchange rate to Shanghai was hard 0.1875. The exchange rate to France was unchanged, the US exchange rate to the British rose by 3.5, the exchange rate to Shanghai was big 4 corners, and the exchange rate to France rose by 0.25. The central listing exchange rates remained the same. The bank's morning opening spot selling prices were 3 office 0.9375 for British gold and 5 yuan 0.3125 for US exchange rates, which were the same as the previous day's late closing US flat and British soft 0.03125, so the exchange rate continued to rise. After opening, it turned from stable to loose, because at that time, Chinese and Western speculators were selling fiercely, and buyers in the market were scarce, and foreign banks' absorption was also quite weak, so Chinese speculators first sold to foreign banks for the June US exchange rate, which had been opened at 5 yuan 0.1875, down to 5 yuan 0.3125. At that time, HSBC's listing was unveiled, the British exchange rate was unchanged, the US exchange rate was lengthened by 4.375, and the white silver balance tax was unveiled, plus 3 percent again. After that, speculators sold the foreign line's May US exchange rate for 5 yuan 0.34375 and 5.3125, and the daily line was in the middle, and once wrote to the Chinese line's current US exchange rate for 5 yuan 0.5625. At the same time, the Chinese line and the central bank absorbed the foreign line's current US exchange rate, which was reported at 5 yuan 0.53125. However, it was heard that the hardest US exchange rate had once seen 5 yuan 0.625, and the British gold reached 4 office 0.09375. This was about 10:15 am. Later, Sassoon came out of the foreign line's May British gold, which was still 4 office 0.046875, but soon the Hong Kong telegram came to suck it up, and HSBC's US exchange rate position was very good. It sucked up more than 100,000 US dollars one after another. Speculators also stopped selling and ran in. For a time, the market turned tight, and there was a profit spit to Chinese speculators for the May US exchange rate, which had been reported at 5 yuan 0.375. The foreign line made the same month's US exchange rate soft to 5 yuan 0.25. At that time, the tightest British gold spot entered the 4 office and was 3 office 0.90625. The closing result was that the British surplus was 3 office 0.9375 and the US exchange rate was 5 yuan 0.28125, which was the same as the morning opening British flat and the US leather shrinkage of 0.03125.</p>
<p>The trend of futures is even more firm</p>
<p>At the beginning of the afternoon opening, the buying spree of speculators was very strong, and the trend was quite tight. Futures were especially popular, so the swap had gradually become detached. The HSBC's US exchange rate for June was 4 yuan 0.8125 for speculators, and the US exchange rate for this month was 5 yuan 0.0625 for the advance of speculators. It was heard that the softest US exchange rate for June had once reported 4 yuan 0.625. Later, the price turned hard because the daily line Mitsui and others suddenly spit it out. It was calculated that the advance of Mitsui's this month's American wine was 5 yuan 0.1875. Although there was a thick stomach and reinstatement, the daily line Mitsui's supply and intention did not show weakness at all. The current US exchange rate was done from 5 yuan 0.21875 to 5 yuan 0.28125. Until the closing, rumors spread that Italy participated in the war, and the market image was even looser. As a result, the British gold was 3 office 0.9375, the US exchange rate was 5 yuan 0.3125, the central gold for this month was 3 office 0.8125, the US exchange rate was 5 yuan 0.15625, and the British gold for June was 3 office 0.65625. The US exchange rate was 4 yuan 0.90625. Compared with the spot on the previous day, the British tightened 0.03125 and the US was flat. The British gold for this month shrank 0.15625 and 0.125, and the next month also shrank 0.1875 and 0.15625.</p>

<h3>After the Plunge at the Opening, the Gold Market Rallies</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cash spot black market saw the light of day again after a plunge. The market seemed to be easily affected by the rebound, resulting in large ups and downs. The highest and lowest prices were nearly 1,000 yuan, which can be described as amazing. At the beginning of the morning, the market was stimulated by yesterday's price drop, and the exchange rate was reported to rise, causing extreme uneasiness and an opening price of 5,400 yuan. Sellers were even willing to lower the price by 20 yuan to sell. Subsequently, the money exchange industry heavily suppressed the price, and a low price of 5,300 yuan was seen. Who knew that the sluggish trend would change suddenly after 11 o'clock? Because the US had not yet joined the European war, the exchange rate turned tight and the selling spree disappeared. Buyers rose sharply, and securities firms, gold shops, and silver shops all bought. The price jumped to 6,100 yuan. Although the money exchange industry took advantage of the high price to sell, and once retreated into the 6,000 yuan level, the noon closing still rose to 6,140 yuan. In the later market, the foreign exchange tightening trend became more and more popular. Securities firms and others increased their positions and bought fiercely, and many new longs searched and bought. The price once rose to the top price of 6,250 yuan. Later, the gold shops made profits on the same day and sold out, and the price fell back to above the 6,000 yuan level. Before the closing, the high price of 6,230 yuan reappeared, but the result was that Italy participated in the war, and a certain gold shop dumped at the closing, falling to a closing price of 6,080 yuan, which was 50 yuan higher than the previous day's closing. It was heard that the trend outside the market was extremely weak, and there was a lack of traders even at 6,000 yuan. Trading was brisk throughout the day, about 5,000 taels. The price of gold jewelry in silver shops fluctuated, but eventually rose by 10 yuan. The price of customs gold remained flat.</p>
<p>Spot Gold Rises and Falls by Nearly 1,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Since the beginning of the morning, the price of each tael (ten liang) plummeted due to the extremely loose foreign exchange rate, and the market was extremely depressed. Before the opening, there was a shout to sell at the opening price, but no one accepted it. Among them, the sellers were willing to sell at 20 yuan lower than the opening price, which shows that the panic has reached its extreme. When it opened at 9:30, the first gold shop came out with ten liang of silver, and only reported 5,400 yuan, which was 630 yuan lower than the previous day. Subsequently, a certain money exchange industry forced down dozens of liang, and then fell by another 100 yuan. The money exchange industry sold a total of 30 liang to retail investors, which was 5,300 yuan. Then, the securities industry saw the opportunity to buy, and the silver shops and gold shops also followed suit and competed to buy. The exchange rate suddenly rose again, and the market turned up for a while. Soon, it rebounded by 800 yuan. The silver shops did 30 liang, which was 6,100 yuan. Later, the buying spree was slightly weakened, and another securities industry and money exchange industry哇 came out, and the retail bulls also made profits and sold out, falling back by 250 yuan. At around 11 o'clock, because the foreign exchange rate was still tight, the buying spree rebounded again, and the silver shops competed to buy. The price rebounded by 300 yuan again. The silver shops sold 20 liang to the gold shops, which was 6,150 yuan. Then, the silver shops did 10 liang, which was 6,140 yuan. The noon closing price. When it opened in the afternoon, the foreign exchange rate was reported to be tight, which stimulated the buying spree. The silver shops advanced 10 liang to the gold shops for 6,200 yuan. Later, the securities industry and the money exchange industry advanced with all their strength, and the price rose by another 50 yuan. The silver shops sold 20 liang to the securities industry for 6,250 yuan. Then, the gold shops suddenly came to compete, and the foreign exchange rate at that time also turned around and fell back by 250 yuan. The silver shops did 10 liang, which was 6,000 yuan. Later, because the securities industry came to suck wildly again, dragging people was numbered, and the silver shops also turned from selling to reality, and the father flew up by 230 yuan again. The gold shops sold 20 liang to the securities industry for 6,230 yuan. Unexpectedly, at that time, there was a sudden intention on the market to participate in the war, and a certain gold shop's long position tended to be caged, and it turned out to be short-selling by hundreds of liang. Soon, it fell by a small 200 yuan. The securities industry sold 30 liang to the silver shops for 6,030 yuan. Approaching the closing, the selling spree slightly slowed down, and then it rose by another 50 yuan. The securities industry sold 20 liang to the silver shops for 6,080 yuan, which was the closing price for the night. As a result, it rose by 50 yuan compared with the previous day's closing.

The total for the whole day was 950 yuan up and down. The selling price of the cash gold shop's original brand gold was 10 yuan higher than the spot price, and the purchase price was reduced by 30 yuan. The current standard gold was more than 50 yuan lower than the listing gold, and there was little trading.</p>

<h3>Foreign Currencies Turn Stable After Falling</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market situation: The British and American gold pounds began to fall sharply with the price of gold. Later, the price of gold rose sharply, so they also rebounded with it. The price of British gold notes rose after the black market British exchange rate loosened. The price of American gold chestnuts continued to fall to 17 yuan in the early morning. Later, the black market American exchange rate rebounded tightly, reaching 19 yuan and 3 cents near noon.

<h3>British and Indian Silver Prices Rise Sharply</h3>
<p>London 15th (telegram): The large strips of silver coins, both near and far futures, have risen by 0.05625, and have risen to about 23 cents. There is little advance from the public, small transactions, and the market situation is flat. The post-closing market is still flat, and buyers have no large transactions according to the listing.

<h3>Discount Returns to 20 Yuan, Interbank Lending Rate Listed at Small 2 Cents</h3>

At noon, it returned to about 100 yuan. In the afternoon, it rose to 130 yuan, and finally to 125 yuan, which was 20 yuan higher than the previous day. The interbank lending rate of the Money Industry Association was listed at 2 dimes and 2 cents in both the morning and afternoon markets, which was 2 cents smaller.</p>
<h3>Securities Domestic Debt Mostly Concluded, Foreign Stocks Hard to Stop Selling</h3>
<p>Yesterday's securities black market situation was very volatile. The market continued to rise in the morning and then suddenly plunged in the afternoon. The fluctuations were erratic and still followed the usual trend of the public debt. Initially, rumors that the United States would assist Britain and France and planned to implement the devaluation of the gold dollar for rapid and favorable economic assistance. The foreign exchange rate rose sharply, the price of gold fell sharply, and the prices of various commodities fell miserably. The public debt was in a favorable position and continued to rise. However, the dollar devaluation could not be implemented overnight. The multi-party then came out of the gold price surge and fell miserably. It still did not get rid of the previous small and large spiral nest. In short, when the money is very tight and the interbank lending rate is too high, this kind of good news that is not skin-deep for public debt cannot cultivate its fundamental strength. However, this kind of thing will gradually tend to be better, but it is only a matter of time. Yesterday's buyers and sellers mostly hoped to conclude, and there were few new transactions. There were more shorts than covering shorts in the morning. The market price was first high and then small. Type C once saw a high price of 50 yuan and 7 cents. In the afternoon, the multi-party closed one after another, and the market price plummeted. Type A broke into the 60 yuan level, and Type C also broke into the 50 yuan level, with a huge drop. After entering, Dongshenjiu Hongkang Yichang and others covered shorts, and the price rebounded slightly by one or two cents. As a result, it was four cents to eight and a half cents smaller than the previous day. The total number of transactions was about 1.2 million yuan. The concise table is listed below.</p>
<p>Category Maximum Minimum Closing Compared with the previous day</p>
<p>Unified A 60.50 59.50 59.50 Fall 0.85</p>
<p>Unified B 52.40 51.50 51.60 Another 0.65</p>
<p>Unified C 50.70 49.35 9.55 Another 0.55</p>
<p>Unified D 48.50 —— 48.50 Another 0.0</p>
<p>Unified E 51.10 50.00 50.05 Another 0.85</p>
<p>Stock trading, 50 shares of Xin Xin Company were traded, at a price of 10 yuan and 5 cents.</p>
<p>The Public Affairs Office reported that although the New York stock market has stopped falling, the local stock market opened steadily. Later, the selling spree gradually increased, and the market situation turned weak again. However, this storm will not last long, because the number of buyers has increased sharply, and the price has rebounded sharply. The noon closing trend price is strong. The afternoon opening was also very good at the beginning. Then, because there were sellers who took advantage of the high price, the late closing price was slightly lower than the highest price. In the future, the market situation will still be dominated by the news of the European War. If the Allied forces are successful in the war, the morale will be high, and the price will tend to rise, which goes without saying. Otherwise, it will only give the sellers the opportunity to operate. Because the market situation is extremely volatile, it is not easy to analyze the huge transactions in one day. However, one point is worth noting, that is, the stock of rubber companies in the Dutch East Indies has been very weak to this day. This is undoubtedly because the general public is very uneasy about the future fate of the territory, because Nazi Germany has now effectively controlled the entire Netherlands.</p>
<p>London 15th (Wednesday) telegram: Today's listing prices of British companies in the Far East have fallen across the board. The stock of Maijia Lee Bank fell 7 shillings and 6 pence, and the price was 8 pounds, 17 shillings, and 6 pence. The stock of HSBC Bank's British registration fell 2 pounds, and the price was 87 pounds. The stock of the parent company's Hong Kong registration fell 2 and a half pounds, and the price was 88 and a half pounds. The stock of Gulak Linpang Rubber fell 7 and a half pence, and the price was 17 shillings and 6 pence. The rest were still stable.</p>
<p>London 15th (Wednesday) telegram: Today's listing prices of Chinese foreign debts have returned to stability. The bonds in the upper and lower ranges have not changed.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Flowers Panic Uncertainty Yarn Market Rises and Falls Sharply The Difference Between the First and Last Board is 250 Yuan</h3>
<p>The price difference between the opening board and the closing board of the yarn market is 250 yuan. This kind of situation has never been seen in the history of the yarn industry. It is generally issued by speculators. The spot price of 20-count double horses once fell to 1,150 yuan. After that, those who made profits made up for it, and it rose to 1,400 yuan. The number of people who cried and laughed in one rise and one fall is unknown.</p>
<p>The current yarn market is tense at the morning opening, which is rare. The general brokers are shouting to sell, but the recipients are afraid to move forward. The price of 20-count double horses is 1,100 yuan, a drop of 50 yuan. After a while, it was heard that the foreign exchange rate was lengthened and the gold price fell again. For a time, sellers came like a tide, and the market price fell straight to 1,150 yuan. The state of panic was indescribable. The price was too low, which aroused the activities of many parties. At the same time, the foreign exchange rate slightly reduced the buying sentiment, and the price quickly rebounded to 1,365 yuan. After closing, it was done to 1,400 yuan. The statistics of the transaction volume in half a day were 1,800 north and 8 bags. 10 pieces of cotton yarn were shipped to Ningbo, and 354 pieces were shipped to Hong Kong. The amount of actual transactions of each gang is listed as follows.</p>
<p>Tonghang 1,700 Hong Kong 130</p>
<p>Ningbo 8 Statistics 1,828</p>
<h3>Raw Cotton Market Downturn; Manufacturers Adopt a Wait-and-See Approach</h3>
<p>Cotton transactions were slow today due to a consistent downturn in the global Indian and American cotton markets, which has dampened sentiment. Simultaneously, manufacturers are also taking a wait-and-see approach. The opening prices for spot cotton are listed below:</p>
<p>Middling: 335.00, 300 bales traded among dealers</p>
<p>Da Zhong Ji: 284.00, with an additional 100 bales traded</p>
<p>Oomra: 240.00, with an additional 100 bales traded</p>
<p>Another report: In the foreign cotton market, New York cotton prices fell again early this morning due to sell-offs by speculators, followed by sell-offs by spot traders and some limit selling. As a result, closing prices were down another 25 points per pound compared to the previous day. The Indian cotton market was also very chaotic, with yesterday's forecast showing a drop of 15 rupees.</p>
<p>Shanghai Foreign cotton transactions are depressed due to overseas cotton market declines, and with the exchange rate easing, the translated cotton prices are exceptionally low. However, due to the increasing expansion of the European war, transportation is becoming increasingly difficult and risky, so there were no transactions. However, Shanghai's inventory is low, and dealers are unwilling to sell at low prices, so spot prices remain exceptionally high. It is reported that the Tianjin group is about to adopt a "scales-speaking" approach, and dealers are actively involved. Here are the overseas cotton market prices converted to factory prices for futures, with the US exchange rate at 5.125:</p>
<p>20 count: American Middling, 345.90</p>
<p>Also, same, lower grade, 335.20</p>
<p>32 count: Same, 370.10</p>
<p>Also, same, lower grade, 360.10</p>
<p>42 count: Same, 372.80</p>
<p>Also, same, lower grade, 361.50</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Cotton Fabric Prices Fluctuate Wildly, Sales Are Difficult</h3>
<p>Amidst the severe domestic situation, the fabric market is experiencing speculative frenzy, with prices surging and plummeting, changing so rapidly it is bewildering. Actual business is proving quite difficult. In the morning, the exchange rate eased, causing widespread anxiety, leading to scattered sales of spot goods. Light weight and fine twill fabrics fell by 3-5 yuan per piece, coarse cloth fell by 1-2 yuan, and colored and bleached fabrics fell by 2-3 yuan. Subsequently, due to a sudden tightening of foreign exchange, short sellers covered their positions, and bulls took advantage of the low prices to increase their positions, causing the market to rebound sharply, similar to the evening market of the previous day. Dealers on this street traded over 300 pieces, while out-of-town buyers only made sporadic transactions, and new orders for various goods were temporarily suspended.</p>
<p>The wild price swings in Dongbu fabrics are particularly alarming. Just as the market was opening cautiously, prices plunged in tandem with cotton yarn, showing a steep decline. Bulls reluctantly closed their positions, with the leading white cloth (fine cloth) falling to 38 yuan per piece, and the colored "Gentleman" (Si Junzi) printed cloth selling at a low of 1.13-1.14 yuan per yard. Later, as foreign exchange tightened and gold and yarn prices rose, the market saw a surge in short covering and new buying, causing a strong rebound. The leading brand rose to 43.5 yuan, and the market continued to rise to 45 yuan at the opening, closing slightly lower at 44 yuan. This month's futures are at 45 yuan, and next month's are at 47.5 yuan. The spot price of "Gentleman" (Junzi) printed cloth also rose to 1.32 yuan. The lowest prices for mid-range fine cloths broke through the 30 yuan mark in the morning, but the market rebounded quickly, trading between 36-37 yuan, indicating that the previous sharp decline had created a need for actual buyers to gradually resume activity.</p>
<h3>Grains: Rice Prices Deviate from the Norm; Fluctuations of 6-7 Yuan Throughout the Day</h3>
<p>Since the sudden and sharp decline in the rice market, the downward trend intensified yesterday. Both domestic and imported rice prices plunged by another significant 2-3 yuan. The imported rice market has been heavily influenced by speculation, with severe fluctuations. The price swings are not only deviating from the norm but also becoming increasingly chaotic. The market was filled with sell orders in the morning, influenced by the previous day's decline and the easing of exchange rates and falling gold prices. No. 1 Saigon rice fell to 50 yuan, new Saigon once reached 48.6 yuan, No. 2 fell to as low as 47 yuan, and Xiao Jiao (small-grain rice) fell to a low of 46 yuan. No. 2 Siam rice fell to as low as 45.8 yuan, a sharp drop of about 2 yuan compared to the closing prices of the previous afternoon. Compared to the high prices of the early morning, there was a difference of about 4 yuan. However, by noon, the tightening of exchange rates and rising gold prices led to a recovery, and prices continued to rise in the afternoon. No. 1 Saigon rice rose to 51 yuan, and No. 2 rose to 49 yuan, while Xiao Jiao (small-grain rice) rose to 48.5 yuan, a rebound of 2.5 yuan and 2 yuan, respectively, compared to the morning's low prices. Original bag No. 2 Siam rice was imported at only 55 yuan in the morning, re-exported at only 56.2 yuan, and No. 2 Saigon opened at 59 yuan, with a low trading price of 55 yuan. In the afternoon, it rose again to 61-62 yuan, a price difference of 6-7 yuan, which is truly a strange phenomenon. No. 1 original bag also fell to as low as 60 yuan.</p>
<p>Another seven or eight truckloads of glutinous rice arrived, further dampening sales, and prices fell by 1-2 yuan.</p>
<p>The supply of thick and thin Japonica rice was abundant yesterday, with over 3,000 bags, mostly from Northern dealers, with Southern dealers accounting for only one-third. However, transactions were scarce, and prices fell by over 2 yuan, following the decline in imported rice prices. Wuxi special clean Japonica rice was 52 yuan, powdered Japonica rice was 51 yuan, Changkun Japonica rice was 51 to 90 yuan, lower grade heat-affected goods were 47-48 yuan, Qingsi Pu rice was 50 to 48-49 yuan, and Nangang early rice was 47-48 yuan.</p>
<h3>Flour Market Remains Tight</h3>
<p>The flour market remains calm. According to the records of No. 2 flour mill, the price is still 14 yuan. Due to the high current costs, and in view of the rapid fluctuations in the gold market, the mills are unwilling to ease prices for the time being. Returned goods from old brands are still quoted at 14 yuan, but there are no formal transactions. Only inland flour brands such as "Mountain Deer" are available in small quantities, priced at 13.6 yuan. The total transactions on this street are less than 5,000 bags. Customer prices for No. 2 flour are still above 15 yuan, but with customers taking a wait-and-see approach, the market is quite quiet. There is no market for wheat.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Imported Sugar Prices Fluctuate Erratically</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market experienced erratic fluctuations due to the black market exchange rate. Prices initially plunged by 6 yuan, but in the afternoon, due to a sudden tightening of foreign exchange, they rebounded by about 1 to 2 yuan. According to the association's pricing, spot prices for No. 24 coarse white sugar from local warehouses were 71 yuan in the morning, a sharp drop of 5.8 yuan, rising to 72.7 yuan and 73 yuan in the afternoon. New goods from foreign warehouses traded from 70 yuan to 70.5 yuan to 71 yuan in the morning, down 6 yuan, and rose to 72-73 yuan to 72.4 yuan in the afternoon. Re-exported goods were 57 yuan to 56.5 yuan, down 4.5 yuan, and rebounded to 58.5 yuan in the afternoon. Taiche (Great Vehicle) white sugar initially fell by 5 yuan, then rebounded to 84.5 yuan. HX mark was 82 yuan in the morning and 83.5 yuan in the afternoon. H Lai Che (H Lai Vehicle) red sugar was 62-63 yuan, down 2 yuan. Dutch red sugar initially was 65 yuan, then 67 yuan in the afternoon, up 1 yuan. Local factory snow white was 71 yuan, down 6 yuan, and rebounded to 73.5 yuan. No. 1 crystal sugar was 95 yuan, and Jing Ming (Crystal Bright) ice sugar was 96.5 yuan, down 3.5 yuan. Also, 2,300 bags of sugar arrived from Hong Kong yesterday.</p>

<h3>After the Expansion of the European War: Fluctuations Among Foreign Residents in Shanghai; America Has Not Yet Reached the Point of Joining the War; Trade Between This Port and the Dutch East Indies Continues as Usual</h3>
<p>The situation in the European War is expanding daily. The changing situation is reflected in Shanghai, the largest city in the Far East. Just like waves rising and falling, responding like an echo, the authorities of Britain, France, and Germany are now engaged in fierce propaganda battles due to the intensification of the European War. It is reported that the British Information Office in China will publish an afternoon newspaper, entrusting the printing to the "North China Daily News" to counter the German "Afternoon Newspaper" published daily in Shanghai. Hostile actions between British, French, Dutch, Belgian, and German expatriates are also gradually becoming apparent with the development of the war.</p>
<p>American Consulate Strenuously Refutes Various Rumors</p>
<p>Recently, rumors have been rife in the market, especially the widespread rumor that the United States will join the European War, which has had a significant impact on the financial market. According to sources close to the American diplomatic community, the United States is currently unlikely to participate in any war, but will not slacken its defense preparations. If national survival is threatened or territory is invaded, it will not hesitate to engage in a war. American expatriates in this port have expressed surprise at the above rumors, as they have not received any notification from the consulate. Those who inquired with the consulate were informed that all external rumors are unreliable. If the situation becomes tense, they will be notified by the most effective method to prepare for evacuation, but there is no such need at present. As for the tense situation in Hong Kong, it is also false, as the American expatriates there are not preparing to evacuate either.</p>
<p>Necessary Measures for Trade with the Dutch East Indies</p>
<p>According to foreign sources, trade between the Dutch East Indies and Shanghai has returned to its original state. The Dutch Consul-General in Shanghai, Mr. Possevan, has scheduled a meeting today with Mr. Felice, the Counselor of the Dutch Legation in Beijing, who recently arrived in Shanghai, to discuss and take all necessary measures to address the temporary suspension of trade between the Dutch East Indies and Shanghai following the German invasion of the Netherlands. Consequently, the exchange rate of the Dutch currency was chaotic. After this, a unified exchange rate mechanism will be established to determine the legal value of the Dutch currency, so that trade between the Dutch East Indies and Shanghai can return to its original state.</p>
<p>The Status of the Concessions Will Definitely Not Change</p>
<p>Shanghai is a major trading port and has many trade relations with the European war situation. When the reporter asked related parties whether there would be any impact on the issue of the Public Concession if Italy were to join forces with the German army due to changes in the European situation, according to the New Voice News Agency's investigation from reliable sources, if Italy participates in the European War, Shanghai is a Public Concession. Although Italian troops are stationed in the Concession, it is for protection purposes. Therefore, the status of the Public Concession will definitely not change and will be able to maintain its original state.</p>
<p>The Italian Ambassador Remains in Shanghai</p>
<p>The Italian Ambassador to Shanghai, Mr. Ma Qiu, is still in Shanghai and currently resides in his private residence on Qi Qi Road. The Italian Consulate General in Shanghai is operating as usual. Italian officials are unusually silent and unwilling to express any opinions. Although there is a part of the defense force stationed in Shanghai, it is purely for the purpose of protecting expatriates and is currently stationed in the area of ​​Laborbert Road in West Shanghai. The Italian warship anchored in Shanghai is currently only the "Carlo Toto" gunboat, which is anchored at buoy number 16 in Pudong.</p>
<p>Talks by German Intelligence Officer</p>
<p>Mr. Kodo, the intelligence commissioner of the German Ambassador to Shanghai, made the following remarks at a reception for journalists yesterday: "Today's so-called nerve war has now entered a war of force. However, predictions made today often do not match the events of the next day. The European situation is changing rapidly, so it is difficult to predict what kind of situation will appear in the next hour. The policies of democratic countries are often determined by discussions of various groups, while Germany makes policy decisions in a minute. Once a policy has been decided, it can be implemented in the next minute. This advantage of the political system can only be implemented by Germany.</p>
<p>Intense Anti-German Atmosphere Among Jews</p>
<p>Last month, five German expatriates residing in the French Concession were ordered to move out due to suspicion of being anti-British and anti-French. Recently, the anti-German atmosphere among Jews has also become intense. According to reliable sources yesterday, three Germans residing in the Sassoon Building, namely Mr. Pick, a machinery merchant, Mr. Klaus, a medicine merchant, and Mr. Mora, a lawyer, also received a notice yesterday that they must move out by the end of this month. At the same time, the Sassoon Building's rental office also received this notice. According to one of the Germans, this move clearly has political implications. Mr. Mora said that whether they can find accommodation elsewhere is a question that the Sassoon Building's rental office has not been willing to answer. He said that their relationship with the Sassoon Building's rental office has always been very friendly, and receiving the relocation notice was a recent event. The owner of the Sassoon Building also declined to comment on this matter. As for whether it is due to a conflict of interests between local Jews and Germans, it cannot be verified. The future is worth noting.</p>
<p>Dutch Expatriate Meeting Decides Attitude</p>
<p>The Continental Daily reports that Dutch expatriates in this city were shocked yesterday (the 15th) when they suddenly heard the news that the Dutch army had surrendered to the German army. Therefore, they changed the weekly banquet held at the Shanghai General Association at 12:30 yesterday afternoon into a meeting to seriously discuss the possible consequences of the Netherlands' encounter with setbacks. A resolution was passed during the meeting, which included that no matter what happens in the future, the affairs of the Dutch expatriates in this city will continue as usual, etc. At the same time, the Java Shipping Company also announced that the surrender of the Dutch army would not affect the sailing schedule of Dutch ships in the Far East.</p>
<p>The Dutch Consul in Shanghai Expresses Serious Remarks</p>
<p>The Dutch Consul-General in Shanghai, Mr. Possevan, told reporters yesterday that he had not yet received official news from the Dutch government that the Dutch army had surrendered. Once this news is officially confirmed, Dutch expatriates in this city may take special steps. Mr. Possevan also said that the Kingdom of the Netherlands is composed of many parts. Although the government has left the country, the Dutch East Indies, West Indies, and other colonies, as well as Dutch expatriates, will continue to operate as usual.</p>
<p>Java Shipments Operate as Usual</p>
<p>According to the Java Shipping Company, Dutch ships in the Far East will continue to operate as usual and there will be no delays. Moreover, the advertisements published by the Dutch Merchant Shipping Company in the newspapers in this city, which were temporarily suspended a few weeks ago, have now been restored, which shows that "everything here has returned to normal." Regarding Dutch ships sailing between the Dutch East Indies and Genoa, USA, no recent news has been received, but it is believed that the scheduled sailing of this line will be maintained. If the situation in the Mediterranean is unsafe, the Dutch ships on this line may be rerouted via the Cape of Good Hope and then to Portugal, or directly to England. However, this route is long and dangerous.</p>
<p>A Large Batch of Dutch Sugar Arrives in Shanghai</p>
<p>The Zhisha Danny of the Dutch Merchant Java Mailboat Company arrived in Shanghai yesterday and docked at the Blue Funnel Wharf to actively unload cargo. As for the Zhini Ganala, it is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on the 20th, but due to cargo reasons, it will be changed to the 21st. These two ships loaded a lot of Dutch-produced group sugar in Java before sailing to Shanghai. The ships that have arrived are now busy with unloading work. The two ships brought about 10,000 bags of Dutch sugar.</p>
<p>Belgian Red Cross Appeals for Donations</p>
<p>The relationship between China and Belgium has always been extremely close. During the January 28th Incident, Belgian expatriates in China donated a large amount to Chinese refugees. After the August 13th Incident, the Ci'an Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital was specially created on Yanhai Road in the Nanshi of Shanghai, and medicines were also dispensed. The Fumu Ci Hui Hospital in Tongren Street, Xujiahui, rescued a large number of refugees, which is deeply felt to this day. This time, Belgium was unfortunately also affected by the war. Madame Ji Youmu, the wife of the Belgian Ambassador to China, organized the Belgian Red Cross in Shanghai to provide relief to her own refugees. It is hoped that people in our country will fulfill their humanitarian obligations and donate generously. The collection points are the China-Belgium Bank on the Bund of this port or the Belgian Consulate at 1300 Lafayette Road.</p>
<h3>Import of Foreign Rice Allowed to Be Tax-Free; Merchants Raise Foreign Currency to Purchase and Transport; Provincial Government Supervises Sales at Parity Price</h3>
<p>In order to increase sources of income and relieve people's food, the Ministry of Finance has stipulated three measures for tax exemption on imported foreign rice during the lean season, and has ordered customs offices across the country to follow them. The measures are recorded as follows: (1) Import of foreign rice is allowed to be exempt from tariffs. (2) Foreign rice is purchased and transported by merchants who raise foreign currency, and the provincial government supervises sales at parity prices. (3) Tax exemption on foreign rice is temporarily limited to imports in May, June, July, and August of this year.</p>
<h3>Salvation Army Plans to Solve the Beggar Problem; It Has Become a Group; Relief Costs a Lot of Trouble</h3>
<p>Salvation Army leader Maurice talked about the fact that by the end of this month, approximately 10,000 refugees in the 35 shelters in this port will be evacuated. Once the evacuation work is completed, the Salvation Army will shift its focus to the relief of the beggar problem. The Salvation Army has been considering this matter in detail and may establish a new organization to shelter beggars. However, the budget will be extremely large, and the recurring maintenance costs after its establishment will be considerable. Fundraising must also be a lot of trouble. There are about 5,000 beggars in this port, most of whom are engaged in begging as a profession, and are under the command of beggar leaders and form groups, which is like a group. The beggar chiefs charge a membership fee. Solving the beggar problem, this special situation is a major difficulty and must be solved.</p>
<h3>French Municipal Council's 6% Public Bonds to Be Redeemed at the End of This Month</h3>
<p>There are still bonds with a face value of 33,300 taels of silver issued by the French Municipal Council's 1911 6% public bonds circulating outside. The Municipal Council has decided to redeem them on May 31 in accordance with the provisions of the installment redemption schedule. In addition, the 1923 and 1936 6% public bonds of the Council have been set to stop transferring from May 15 to May 31.</p>
<h3>Municipal Council Approves Increase in Water Surcharge; Increased to 110%; Budget Based on Exchange Rate</h3>
<p>In view of the soaring prices and the sharp increase in various expenses, the Shanghai Water Company submitted to the Municipal Council last month, attaching the revised budget for this year, requesting that the current water surcharge of 50% be increased to 110% from June 1. The above budget is compiled based on the exchange rate of four pence for British gold and six cents for US dollars converted into one yuan in national currency, explaining the increase in various expenses due to the increase in salaries and the rise in prices of goods, especially fuel and electricity. The amount of water used last year was more than the previous year, but this year it is not expected to increase, and prices are likely to continue to rise. Therefore, salaries, etc., will have to be readjusted. According to the current water tariff, the income from the surcharge collection rate, after deducting expenses, the remaining amount is far short of the gold pound shares that should be paid according to the regulations. The company is concerned about this matter. The motivation for requesting the increase in the surcharge this time is based on this, in order to generate a surplus in this year's income item, which is sufficient to pay for the above-mentioned dividend expenditure. Under the current situation, it is impossible to compile a fairly accurate budget. The aforementioned budget is compiled based on experience, and the various expenses listed are the minimum and cannot be adjusted. Therefore, it is necessary to find ways to increase income. As for the increased amount of expenses in the future, on the 7th of this month, the company supplemented in writing that the request this time was based on the exchange rate of four pence and the assumption that the implementation of the price increase would not exceed the end of May. Recently, the exchange rate has been trending lower again. If the above request is not implemented as scheduled, the proposed increase in income will still be insufficient and a supplementary budget will have to be compiled separately, requesting another price increase in the short term. The case was submitted to the Public Utilities Committee of the Municipal Council for the first meeting on the 9th of this month for careful discussion, and the company's situation was carefully studied. As a result, the claimed items are still reasonable and should be approved, but the implementation period will be changed to start when the water use period ends on or after June 17 of this year. At the same time, the bureau will reconsider this matter at any time before the end of November of this year. On the one hand, please send representatives from the company and the bureau to discuss the gold pound dividends that the company should pay according to the regulations, in order to reduce the burden on users. All the above suggestions were passed by the board of directors of the bureau at the regular meeting on the 15th of this month. At the meeting of the committee, member Mitchell was elected as the chairman of the committee.</p>
<h3>Liquor and Vegetable Industry, etc., Pay Disaster Relief Donations as Usual</h3>
<p>The chicken people donations from the liquor and vegetable industry and the entertainment industry in this city are very large. If only the liquor and vegetable industry is counted, the amount paid to the Refugee Association every month is about 35,000 yuan, which has recently increased to about 40,000 yuan. However, in order to reduce the public burden, the Refugee Association has decided to disband all refugees in shelters except for the disabled, elderly, widows, and orphans before the 31st of this month. Therefore, various industries that have been paying refugee donations have doubts about whether the refugee donations will continue to be paid in full in the future. A reporter from the Pingming News Agency visited the Refugee Association, which said that after the refugees are disbanded, the refugee donations from various industries will still be collected as usual, because prices are soaring and the association's expenses are huge, and funds are not sufficient.</p>

<h3>The Decree to Suppress Prices Is Due to Be Implemented; The Market Is Full of Goods but There Is No Way to Sell Them; The Relaxation of Foreign Exchange Naturally Reduces Costs</h3>
<p>The North China Daily News published a letter from a reader stating that on the 2nd of this month, the value of the French currency shrank from four pence two five to three pence two five, and the prices of all goods in Shanghai suddenly rose by a quarter within a few hours. After that, the value of the French currency increased sharply, almost recovering by half, but the stores did not reduce their prices. The authorities recently issued a notice stating that "those who make illegal profits will be prosecuted." If this notice is valuable, now is the opportunity to prove it. In the past, the high prices were caused by the situation, and no one opposed it. However, we now require the authorities to take steps to suppress prices immediately. If this is not done, any excuse is unreasonable. Merchants who do not reduce prices should be regarded as making illegal profits and punished.</p>
<p>Coal Prices Continue to Fall</p>
<p>In view of the sharp decline in gold prices and the reduction in costs for various coal briquette factories, the Municipal Council of the Public Concession has notified the coal briquette manufacturers to effectively and quickly reduce the selling price of coal briquettes in order to ease the burden on the people. It is reported that after receiving the notice, the factories decided to meet and discuss how to do so. After the coal market opened at 1:00 p.m. yesterday, people continued to be bearish. Major coal companies sold their stocks at quoted prices. Except for other goods forming a swirling situation, as a result, Hongji lump coal continued to fall by 11 yuan per ton. The current wholesale price among the industry has fallen back to 216 yuan, and because customers have no intention of absorbing any more, the market transaction is not large. According to a coal industry committee member yesterday, although the European war has expanded, there is no problem with the source of coal, and the coal inventory in Shanghai is very substantial.</p>
<p>Rice Market Sluggish</p>
<p>The rice market was still sluggish yesterday. Following the fatigue on the previous day, it fell by one or two yuan, but the number of sellers doubled and the buyers disappeared. For a time, the spot goods were full, and it seemed that few people were interested. The trade in miscellaneous grains and oil cakes was chaotic, and all goods were bearish. People were panicked and could not live in peace. A rice industry tycoon told the Datong News Agency that the rice market would continue to fall, because the Shanghai stock has now increased to 1.5 million bags in Dongzhan, and 2,000 to 3,000 bags of domestic rice arrive in Shanghai every day by land and water. The biggest reason is that Wuhu rice has been unbanned and the Japanese army has allowed merchants to purchase it in Qianzhu. According to the current population of this city, even relying solely on the stock, it can be maintained for half a year. The fourth phase of parity rice sales in this city is still raising funds. It is reported that funds of 600,000 yuan have been raised, but this is far from enough. It is hoped that all sectors will donate generously, because according to the third phase of parity rice sales, with 48 rice shops and 20 days of parity rice sales, about 1.5 million yuan will be needed.</p>
<p>Chinese Director's Opinion</p>
<p>According to Chinese director Yu Qiaqing, if the exchange rate of gold falls, the prices should also be reduced, but it is really incomprehensible that most manufacturers are still selling at high prices. Taking coal as an example, the reason for the previous price increase was to use the excuse of high gold prices, but now the gold prices have recovered to the prices before the exchange rate changed, so the prices of various coals should also return to their original levels, and the price of coal balls, which rose three times in ten days, should also return to the original price, which is also beneficial to various manufacturers. Lin Kanghou also said that the selling price of legitimate industry and commerce should be determined according to cost, which is legitimate, but it changes with the foreign exchange rate, which cannot be called legitimate, because once the price rises, it does not immediately decrease with the fall of the US dollar. As for public utilities such as electricity, trams, tap water, and public buses, they are originally public utilities that prioritize public interests and are granted patents, which are not comparable to profit-making businesses in free competition. Therefore, they should take into account the burden on the public on the one hand, and at the same time take into account the sustainability of public utilities, so the increase in their prices also changes with the exchange rate of the US dollar, as if the currency in the Shanghai market has become the Lujin standard. It is hoped that the municipal authorities will do their best to think about the interests of the greatest number of people, so that public security can be ensured.</p>
<h3>Japan's Threat to Foreign Ships Is a Self-Justification</h3>
<p>The North China Daily News reported that a Japanese Navy spokesman confirmed yesterday (the 15th) that the Japanese authorities in this city have asked foreign ships between Shanghai and Wenzhou to cooperate and obey the regulations of Japanese warships. The spokesman replied to a reporter at a reception for journalists that the Japanese Navy entrusted the Japanese Consulate General on April 26 to notify the consular corps in this city, requesting foreign ships to obey the established procedures. The reason why the Japanese authorities issued this notice was because ships flying foreign flags were found near Wenzhou, entering and leaving the port of Wenzhou at night without lights, making it extremely difficult for the Japanese side to distinguish whether they were Chinese ships or ships of a third country. So far, no foreign ships have been detained.</p>
<h3>Gold Rises Ineffectively, Black Market Trends Still Loose; The Real Value of Chinese Legal Tender Is Increased; "United Reserve Notes" and Japanese Yen Both Plunge</h3>
<p>After the wave of gold falling sharply and black market exchange rates shrinking sharply at the beginning of this month, only ten days apart, starting from the 14th, it turned to falling sharply and loosening sharply. As of yesterday, gold still could not rise effectively, and the black market exchange rate could not shrink. However, it fluctuated greatly and rose and fell greatly. A reporter from the Pingming News Agency asked a certain authority in the banking sector about the relationship between the fall in gold and the sharp loosening of the black market exchange rate with the Chinese financial sector and whether there were any arbitrage activities by the Japanese side. According to him, the fall in gold prices and the sharp loosening of the black market exchange rate this time are increasingly beneficial to Chinese finance. The relationship is as follows: (1) It is rumored that the Hong Kong Stabilization Fund Committee has stopped supplying the Shanghai black market foreign exchange a few days ago, but this is a rumor spread by speculators, but the rise and fall of the Shanghai black market exchange rate have absolutely no impact on China's entire financial policy. (2) The Chinese side has repeatedly won victories in the Sino-Japanese War and is more and more confident in winning the final victory, so the value of the legal currency has invisibly increased, which is also one of the reasons for the loosening of the exchange rate this time. (3) After the expansion of the European War, the import of foreign goods will be reduced, and the export of domestic goods will be in greater demand, which is very beneficial to the Chinese financial sector.</p>
<p>The Japanese Side Has No Extra Capacity for Arbitrage</p>
<p>(4) The legal currencies seized by the Japanese side in the occupied areas, of which the Jianghai Customs revenue is the largest, have been spent in previous arbitrage activities and other uses, leaving little left, and they are suffering from the pain of being stretched. In this loosening of the black market exchange rate, there are no surplus funds available for arbitrage, so the Japanese side has no profit to make. In the last three periods, no large-scale arbitrage activities by the Japanese side have been found. According to the French Shanghai Daily yesterday, news from Hong Kong said that the Stabilization Committee has increased its fund by 2.5 million pounds. If so, the exchange rate of the legal currency will be even more bullish.</p>
<p>Yesterday's Market Conditions of Cash Black Market Exchange Rate</p>
<p>In the early morning, gold still fell sharply, opening at 5,400 yuan, followed by 5,300 yuan, a plunge of 730 yuan compared with the closing price of the previous day. But by noon, it rose step by step, exceeding the 6,000 yuan mark again, reaching 7,140 yuan. In the afternoon, it entered a swirling state, fluctuating uncertainly, but the general situation was still calm. The closing price in the evening was 6,080 yuan. As for the black market exchange rate, the loosest British exchange rate reached three pence nine three seven five, and the US exchange rate reached five yuan six eight seven five, but at the close in the evening, the British exchange rate was still two pence nine three seven five, and the US exchange rate was five yuan three one two five.</p>
<p>The Japanese Yen Group Is Approaching Collapse</p>
<p>The purpose of the Japanese yen group in the pseudo "Manchukuo" and North China is to facilitate Japan's export and import to China and to absorb as much of China's resources as possible. However, the price of the "United Reserve Notes" is falling more and more severely, and the price of the Japanese yen is also falling. Yesterday it was one yuan one corner five points. According to yesterday's Japanese newspaper, the total number of "United Reserve Notes" flowing into the pseudo "Manchukuo" is about 3.4 million, which is still hindering the local finance. It has been decided to order the complete removal of the "United Reserve Notes" in the pseudo "Manchukuo" by June 15. At the same time, North China has also announced restrictions on the circulation of Japanese yen currency, which proves that the Japanese yen group is approaching collapse.</p>
<h3>The Public Works Department Workers Go on Strike; Discussing How to Deal With It; Garbage Piles Up on the Roads, Inconvenient for Citizens; Hoodlums Take the Opportunity to Cause Trouble and Force the Market to Close</h3>
<p>Regarding the strike of workers in the Public Works Department of the Municipal Council, the Director General, the Director of the Public Works Department, and the Chief of the Police Department discussed appropriate handling methods together yesterday (16th) in the hope that the labor unrest would be resolved as soon as possible. Yesterday, garbage piled up on the roads, which hindered both transportation and hygiene, and was inconvenient for citizens.</p>
<p>Carpenter's Conditions</p>
<p>The conditions required by the carpenters in the Engineering Repair Department are as follows: (1) Wages are paid as usual for Sundays, Chinese and foreign New Year's Day, and Winter Solstice holidays. (2) If work is not stopped on holidays, double wages should be paid. The minimum wage per person is two yuan per day. The requirements of other ironworkers, coppersmiths, and machine workers are roughly the same.</p>
<p>Hongkou Responds</p>
<p>The strike of the manure car drivers has not been resolved either. Yesterday, the manure car drivers in Hongkou Yangshupu also started a strike and put forward the following requirements: (1) It is required that each manure car hand in three cars per day, and add three yuan per month. If there are four cars, add four yuan. (1) It is required that the Jiaxing Road manure pier be restored. According to a letter from the manure drivers at the Laozha Pier, etc., the statement in the newspaper that the representatives Shen Zhaohuai and Huang Guishun were contacted is not accurate.</p>
<p>Take the Opportunity to Cause Trouble</p>
<p>At about 7:00 a.m. yesterday, some unscrupulous elements took the opportunity to cause trouble and mixed into the workers, smashed a public five car No. 887 in the Suzhou Road Engineering Department, and damaged two tramcars on Route 16 at Caojiadu. On Xinzha Road, there were also a few workers lying on the tram tracks, and traffic was blocked for a time. All the glass of three public buses on Route 10 was smashed. It was not until the police arrived to suppress the situation that it calmed down.</p>
<p>Forced to Close</p>
<p>At about 7:00 a.m. yesterday, at the intersection of Xinzha Road and Maigen Road in the Public Concession, two to three hundred people shouted loudly all the way to the east as each store was opening its doors to prepare for business, asking the stores to close. The stores were afraid of accidents, so they closed the doors that had been removed again. At the intersection of Chihong Bridge North Chengdu Road, a rice shop was robbed of a few loads of indica rice and white rice because it had already removed its doors and closed them a little slowly. A coffin shop at the intersection of Mei Baige Road did not listen to the strike because no one robbed coffins, and a small coffin was thrown into the road and destroyed by the workers. Similar incidents abound, so all the stores on Xinzha Road from Maigen Road to North Mud Bridge were not opened yesterday until they automatically reopened between 2:00 p.m. and 3:00 p.m.</p>
<h3>Shame and Honesty Movement Assembly Sends Telegram to Central Government to Celebrate Victory: Final Victory Today is Approaching, Urging Shanghai Citizens to Vow Even Greater Efforts</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Shame and Honesty Movement Committee, considering the unprecedented great victory in the recent Henan-Hubei campaign, not only has it given international and domestic figures a more accurate understanding of China's resistance forces, but it has also shattered the Japanese militarists' dream of completing their military aggression. It has sent a telegram to the Central Government to congratulate them, the text of which reads: To the Chongqing Central Party Headquarters, the National Government, and Chairman Chiang: In the recent great battle in southern Henan and northern Hubei, the Japanese army mobilized 150,000 troops, vainly hoping to advance westward to control Xiangfan and threaten Sichuan and Shaanxi. Fortunately, our Supreme Commander foresaw the situation and displayed strategic brilliance. Our frontline soldiers launched divine power, loyally and bravely annihilated the enemy, and ultimately trapped the exhausted and war-weary troops, leaving them nowhere to escape. Over 60,000 were captured or killed, achieving an unprecedented great achievement since the start of the war of resistance. Triumphant reports poured in, and all of Shanghai rejoiced, proving that final victory is approaching. In addition to encouraging citizens to vow even greater efforts, this committee sends this telegram to congratulate you and pay our respects. Respectfully submitted by the Shanghai Municipal Shame and Honesty Movement Committee.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council's Rice Subsidy for Chinese Staff</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council has been providing a monthly rice subsidy to its Chinese staff with monthly salaries of 100 or 200 white dollars or less, as a gesture of consideration. It is now known that the rice subsidy for May is 7 dollars.</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Strengthens Military Strength in the Far East: General Stern Returns to the Far East to Assume Important Post; Stern Commanded Operations in Nomonhan Last Summer</h3>
<p>The "North China Daily News" reports that the Japanese-language "Shanghai Mainichi Shimbun" states that General Stern, the former commander of the Soviet Far East Red Army division who later commanded Soviet troops in the Finnish War, has recently returned to the East to assume an important post. Stern was the successor to General Galen and commanded operations in Nomonhan last summer. His return to the Far East shows that the Soviet Union is improving the staff of the Far East Red Army and strengthening its military strength in the Far East.</p>
<h3>Redemption of Famine Relief Bonds Interest Paid On Time</h3>
<p>The National Government, in order to provide relief to refugees and expand productive enterprises, issued the 27th Year of the Republic of China Famine Relief Bonds, with a total amount of 100 million national currency units, issued in installments. The first tranche of 30 million yuan was issued on July 1, 1938, at 98% of face value, with an annual interest rate of 4% and a term of 20 years, calculated from July 1, 1942.

The bond fund is secured by the Central Disaster Relief Reserve Fund, and the redemption fund is allocated by the Ministry of Finance from the national treasury tax revenue. The interest on the bonds due on June 30 of this year, totaling 600,000 yuan, has been allocated from the Central Disaster Relief Reserve Fund and transferred to the account of the National Debt Fund Management Committee of the Central Bank, specially stored for payment. The paying agent is the Central Bank and its entrusted banks.</p>
<h3>The Case of the Shooting of Hu Shti: The Murderer Confesses the Course of Events; The Case is Complicated, Admits to Firing the Gun Without Reservation; Sentenced to Seven Years' Imprisonment, Gun Confiscated</h3>
<p>Hu Shti, a native of Kunshan, residing at No. 9, Lane 406, Shanhaiguan Road, is 19 years old. He used to work in a certain agency of the Chongqing government. After being sent to Shanghai, Hu suddenly changed his principles and worked in another agency. At the same time, he went to Daxia University on Jing'an Temple Road to study. At 12:55 noon on May 1, Labor Day, Hu went to school as usual to attend classes. However, as soon as he stepped onto the stairs, he was shot at.</p>
<p>Shot in Vital Point</p>
<p>He died of his injuries. The detective arrested a suspect named Chen Yiping (21 years old), a native of Changzhou, and found a Lianpeng pistol and two bullets. He was taken to the police station and sent to the First Special Court for interrogation and detention. Yesterday morning, the case was continued in the Second Criminal Court by Judge Xiao Peishen. The police station prosecuted Chen Yiping for murder under Article 271, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law, and Zhang Tianyin, a lawyer from the police station, rose to present the case, saying that according to the defendant's confession at the police station, he lived in Changzhou. After the outbreak of the war, he took his family to Chongqing and received</p>
<p>Military Training</p>
<p>He returned to his hometown last year. He met a friend named Yu Genda, who asked him if he had any work. He replied that he did not and asked Yu what he did. Yu replied that he worked in the government in Chongqing. The defendant then asked to join. Yu agreed. Four weeks before the incident, the defendant and Yu came to Shanghai from Changzhou and stayed at Room 73 of the Zhejiang Hotel on Zhejiang Road. Yu gave him a few yuan for daily expenses. On April 12, the defendant and Yu were walking on Avenue Edward VII and Carter Road when they met a friend, Chen Jinbiao, who was talking to them when the deceased, Hu Shti,</p>
<p>Suddenly Came Forward</p>
<p>And opened fire, killing Chen and Yu Biao. The defendant and others fled one after another. According to Yu, Hu came to shoot at Yu Genda, not Chen Jinbiao, who was mistakenly shot. Now that Hu has done such a thing, revenge is necessary. He led the defendant to the entrance of Daxia University and scouted several times. He also learned that Hu must go to the school every day at noon. On May 1, Yu gave the defendant a pistol and told him to kill Hu. If a detective chases after the shooting, he does not need to escape and can surrender himself. At that time, the defendant</p>
<p>Then Waited</p>
<p>And saw Hu arrive by public bus and enter the school to go upstairs. The defendant followed him in and fired two shots at him. Hu was not dead at the time and shouted for help. The defendant turned around and fired another shot. Detectives gathered and he was arrested. When questioned, the defendant confessed that this was his personal act. Under the voluntary defense of lawyer Xi Yafu, Judge Xiao sentenced Chen Yiping to seven years of imprisonment for murder, and the pistol and bullets were confiscated.</p>
<h3>Many Theft Cases; Criminals Apprehended and Interrogated</h3>
<p>In the past few days, the Public Concession police have arrested many thieves. The details are as follows: (1) Chinese detectives Shan Zhaoxian and Zhang Bingchun of the Old Gate Police Station arrested thieves Lu Shufa, Shi Di, Hu Xingde, and Wang Caidi from Shaoxing and Yong in Room 109 of the Daran Hotel at No. 66 Zhifu Road. They confiscated a Mauser pistol, 36 bullets, and 19 pawn tickets. It was learned that these people committed crimes in the concession. (2) The Songshun Rice Store at No. 94 Henan Road was suddenly broken into by a thief, who stole 400 yuan in legal tender. As a result, Chinese detective Cheng Renkun of the General Police Station and Indian constable No. 246 arrested the thief Zhang Youquan (from Pudong). They confiscated a Mauser pistol, 3 bullets, and the original stolen 400 yuan. He confessed that he had also arrested an accomplice named Dai Fengkang in Room 407 of the Guotai Hotel on Balibridge Street, and a rifle for official use and 5 bullets were found in his house. (3) On the 13th of the month, the Jincheng Tour Guide Agency at No. 8, Lane 205, Guangxi Road, reported to the Old Gate Police Station that 220 yuan in legal tender had been stolen and a hand grenade was left behind. Chinese detective Guo Ruiquan went to investigate. Xu Xigen from Wuxi, Bao Amao from Danyang, and Chen Xiaomao from Tongzhou surrendered to the police station, saying that although they went to Jincheng on that day, they did not rob, but because Tong Xiaomao of the agency had beaten and insulted them, they went to retaliate. They were detained for investigation. The above cases were separately sent to the First Special Court yesterday morning. Lawyers Ru Baoji, Qian Jiuxun, and Chen Ming of the police station presented the cases, requesting detention for further investigation. After questioning by Judges Xiao and Jiang, they were ordered to be detained separately and questioned again at a later date.</p>
<h3>Jishan Amusement Fair, Third Day of Grand Occasion</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the third day of the amusement fair to raise funds for the expansion of the education and production expenses of the Refugee Children's Education Center. In addition to the original Shanghai opera performances, the Spanish bullfight and the Kepbi electric chess competition were held at the same time, so people from all walks of life went to watch the event with great enthusiasm. The Animal Protection Committee also sent a Westerner to visit the actual situation of bullfighting. Therefore, the bullfighting program was performed in advance. Five strong men took turns to perform various wrestling performances with the bull, which were exciting and thrilling, winning the audience's extremely enthusiastic applause and thunderous applause. The charity chess match between Xue Weihan and Lian Xuezheng was full of intrigue and no concession to each other. Chess fans were uneasy when watching the critical moments, and some even exclaimed in surprise. The state of being proud and forgetful was overflowing on their faces. Later, the electric chess suddenly broke down and could not be repaired for a while, so the winner was not determined and will have to continue the battle tomorrow. It is reported that the full-day ticket revenue reached more than 5,000 yuan.</p>

<h3>Love Tragedy in Russian Apartment on Rue Lupan: Russian Dancer Takes American Sailor as Lover; White Russian Youth Burns with Jealousy; Shoots Russian Woman, Sailor, and Then Commits Suicide</h3>
<p>The English-language "China Press" reports that a murder and suicide occurred in a Russian apartment at No. 7, Lane 256, Rue Lupan, this morning (16th). The deceased were an American sailor, a White Russian dancer, and an unemployed White Russian youth. The details are as follows: The White Russian dancer, Ait Golova, 25, has been selling dances in a nightclub on Avenue Joffre for several months. She lives in an apartment at No. 7, Lane 256, Rue Lupan, and has an affair with 25-year-old White Russian youth Libakov, who lives in the neighboring room. Before 2:00 a.m. this morning, Ait returned to the apartment with O'Donnell, a first-class fireman from the American warship Augusta. Libakov heard the sound and,</p>
<p>Burning with Jealousy</p>
<p>Broke into Ait's room without saying a word. He took out a .32 caliber Colt automatic pistol and shot at Ait and the American sailor. Then he returned to his room and shot himself. The American sailor was shot twice in the chest and died of his injuries shortly after arriving at Guangci Hospital. Ait was shot in the abdomen, and blood gushed out. She staggered to the stairs, where she met another woman and gasped, "Libakov shot me and the American sailor." After saying this, she returned to her room. Another woman immediately reported to the French Concession Police Department, who sent Ait to the Russian Hospital on Rue Bourgeat. Ait was able to answer one question, before finally, at 6:00 a.m.,</p>
<p>Died of Her Injuries</p>
<p>The police found Libakov in his room. He had shot himself, with a bullet in his brain. His body was leaning against the window, with the pistol still in his right hand. Libakov used to work in a European jewelry store, but was later laid off. He joined the Public Concession Police Department as a special patrolman, but his livelihood relied heavily on Ait. It has not yet been determined whether the pistol used by Libakov was his official police pistol. The murdered American sailor, O'Donnell, was born in Camden, New York, USA. The American Consulate Court investigated O'Donnell's murder at 2:30 p.m. today.</p>

<h3>Strange Theft Case at the YMCA: Two Sons Plot to Rob Their Father; Two Sons Covet Their Father's Wealth; Instigate Robbers, All Arrested</h3>
<p>At approximately 8:20 a.m. yesterday morning, two young robbers suddenly broke into Room 812, 8th Floor, China YMCA, No. 123 Avenue Pichon, and committed violence against the lodger. One robber was apprehended on the spot by the YMCA staff. According to the robber, they were instigated by the lodger's two sons, and the two sons were also arrested. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Rewarded with a Pistol After Being Treated with Courtesy</p>
<p>Wang Gongyun, a Christian from Yantai, Shandong, over 50 years old, used to be the chairman of the Korean Chinese Chamber of Commerce and has considerable assets. Now that he is old and tired of business, he is temporarily living as a seafarer, enjoying his twilight years, and living alone in Room 812 on the 8th floor of the YMCA dormitory in the Eight Immortals Bridge. At 8:20 yesterday morning, after Wang got up, he was having breakfast on the 9th floor of the YMCA. Unexpectedly, two unknown youths, one in a gray suit and the other in a dark brown suit, went to Room 812 on the 8th floor and knocked on the door, claiming that they wanted to see Mr. Wang. After being asked to wait a moment by the waiter, Wang finished his meal and slowly went downstairs. As soon as he stepped into the room, the two youths rushed forward to greet him and claimed that Mr. Jin had something to ask them to come and discuss. At this time, Wang glanced at the visitors, who looked like young students, and treated them with courtesy. He offered them tea and water. Before he could say a few words, one of them closed the door and threatened him with a fake pistol. The other person untied a bundle on the couch and wrapped it around his neck, preventing him from making a sound. Wang realized that he had encountered violence and shouted for help. Fortunately, a staff member named Ge Lanyan in Room 813 across the hall was sweeping the floor. Hearing Wang's cries for help, he knew something was wrong and helped to shout for help.</p>
<p>Apprehended a Robber and Confessed the Mastermind</p>
<p>The two robbers realized that they had been exposed, so they opened the door. One of the robbers, the one holding the fake pistol, fled down the spiral staircase and escaped through the back door. The other robber fled in a panic and mistakenly broke into Room 825 to hide. At this time, all the staff members gathered after hearing the alarm. One staff member named Gao Longqi (27 years old, from Haimen, serving for seven years) disregarded his own safety and apprehended a robber in Room 825. At the same time, the downstairs administrator Jiao Shiqing also heard the alarm. He immediately notified the police station and ordered the front and back doors to be closed to prevent people from entering and leaving. He also directed the staff to search for the robbers everywhere. At approximately 8:50, police officers from the police station arrived in police cars and took the arrested robber to the police station. According to the robber's confession at the police station, they were instigated by the lodger's two sons to rob their father of all his belongings. They had also agreed to report the robbery at No. 33 Yuheng Lane, Route Cardinal Foch, after the event. After the police station learned of the confession, they immediately sent someone to wait there. As a result, the lodger's two sons were arrested. After the two were confronted, the two sons confessed.</p>
<h3>Shooting in the French Concession Last Night: Gu Hansheng Killed on the Spot</h3>
<p>At 9:05 last night, two gunshots suddenly rang out at the entrance of Lane 1, Rue Amiral Courbet, in the French Concession. When the nearby constables arrived, they saw a man of about 50 years old, wearing a long black satin gown, lying in a pool of blood at the entrance of the alley. He was still able to speak at the time, and claimed to be Gu Hansheng from Changshu. There were two murderers in total. At this point, he could not bear the pain. The constables did not have time to ask him more questions and immediately called the police station. By the time the detectives and patrol officers arrived, he had already died. They collected the bullet casings for investigation and sent the body to the post-mortem examination center on Route Tenant de la Tour, waiting to report to the Second Special District Court for examination. At the same time, they are investigating the deceased's detailed background to make a judgment.</p>
<h3>Rent Increase Case at Siming Lane, Corner of Avenue Joffre and Rue Lupan: Tenants Unanimously Oppose</h3>
<p>The houses in Siming Lane, corner of Avenue Joffre and Rue Lupan, are owned by the Shanghai Siming Bank. The bank originally managed the rentals itself. From the second half of last year, the American China Investment Company was entrusted to manage the rentals. A few days ago, the company suddenly issued a notice to the tenants of the lane, saying that due to the high prices in Shanghai and the company's various expenses on real estate have increased sharply, we have no choice but to increase the monthly rent by 30% from June of this year. All the tenants in the lane believe that at a time when white goods are expensive and life is difficult, and the landlord is exerting pressure, it is really adding insult to injury and is unbearable. Therefore, a tenants' association has been organized, intending to strongly request the company to withdraw its order and maintain the original rent amount to reduce the burden on the tenants in the lane, and also request the community to provide assistance. In addition, the reasons for the rent increase listed by the company are controversial. It is found that the water, electricity, and property tax in the lane are all handled by the tenants themselves, and the houses in the lane are newly built and have never been repaired. The so-called sharp increase in various expenses on real estate, what does it mean, it is really difficult to find out. The company's actions are regrettable.</p>
<h3>Local News in Brief</h3>
<p>The Shanghai YWCA on Jing'an Temple Road has been established for 32 years. In order to enrich the service manpower and expand the service scope, it will hold the 32nd Membership Solicitation Conference. It will solicit enthusiastic volunteers and women who wish to receive services from families, professions, students, and workers. The quota is 1,500 people.</p>
<p>The Wylie Juice Factory on Avenue Edward VII, owned by the Yu brothers of Nantong, has launched a new summer drink, Red Leaf Pear Juice. This juice is still a novelty in cold drinks. Its taste is the same as raw pear water. It can calm the liver, produce body fluid, and relieve cough. Its effect is very significant.</p>
<h3>Complicated Inside Story of Xiao Shi Kidnapping Case: Xiao Has Escaped Dangerously and Taken His Family to Hong Kong; Gatekeeper and Constable Colluded; Conviction and Failure to Report Appeal Concluded</h3>
<p>Xiao Shi, a fellow villager of Liang, the mastermind of the Hollywood gambling den in western Shanghai, was kidnapped by bandits at 8:50 p.m. on December 8 last year. Ten minutes after the incident, Wang Jinshan, the gateman and constable from Anhui who was stationed at No. 148, Lane Jiaozhou Road, where Xiao lived, reported the incident to the Jing'an Temple Police Station by telephone, stating that</p>
<p>Two Kidnappers</p>
<p>Walked into the lane, each holding a pistol. First, they frightened and silenced him, forcing him to face the wall, and disarming him. Then they went to Xiao's house at No. 11 in the lane, dragged Xiao Shi out of the lane, and forced him into a pre-arranged car, which sped away. However, one of the pistols taken from him by the bandits was dropped by the bandits at the entrance of Xiao's house and was recovered. The constable then personally went to the police station to describe the situation in detail, and the captain dispatched Chinese and Western detectives to Xiao's house to inquire and found that Xiao had indeed been kidnapped and was missing. However, inquiries with the neighbors</p>
<p>Failed to Confirm</p>
<p>The circumstances of the kidnapping, and no one had witnessed it. After repeatedly questioning Wang Jinshan, Wang also claimed that one of the two bandits was Xiao's cook, whom he knew. He had told him that he was mistreated by his master and would be dismissed, so he wanted to kidnap him for ransom and was willing to share the money with him. The captain suspected that the gateman had helped in the kidnapping, so he immediately detained him and ordered detectives to strictly investigate the bandits and rescue the victim to clarify the truth. While the Chinese and Western detectives were stepping up their investigation, Liang, the owner of Hollywood, requested that</p>
<p>The Investigation Be Delayed</p>
<p>So that Xiao could be safe, otherwise it would be detrimental to the victim. Later, on January 20 of this year, the police station learned that Xiao had gone to Hong Kong, and soon his family also left Shanghai. Therefore, the details of Xiao's kidnapping, the circumstances of his ransom, and the amount of money spent are still unclear. However, Wang Jinshan's actions of assisting in kidnapping for ransom are obvious, and he was prosecuted according to law. The First Special District District Court concluded the first instance and sentenced him to three and a half years of imprisonment. The prisoner refused to accept the conviction and filed an appeal. At 3:00 p.m. yesterday, the Second Branch of the Higher Court, with Presiding Judge Wen Hante presiding over the collegial panel,</p>
<p>Summoned the Prisoner Wang</p>
<p>To court for inquiry. Wang still denied participating in the kidnapping, and lawyer Fan Gang defended him, pointing out that the police station could not provide conclusive evidence to prove that Wang Jinshan had assisted in the crime. He also claimed that if Wang had actually received a share of the ransom, why would his family still be poor? Our lawyer has repeatedly appeared in court, but has not received any public funds. However, lawyer Gan Jingxian of the police station and the prosecutor who attended the court both relied on the facts obtained from the investigation and Wang's confession to determine that the pistol Wang was carrying was not taken by the bandits, but was borrowed by Wang to the bandits</p>
<p>Beforehand</p>
<p>Without any doubt, he requested the presiding judge to reject the appeal. Judge Zhou then announced the end of the debate and scheduled a date for the verdict. Wang Jinshan was still ordered to be sent back to the Jing'an Temple Police Station for detention. The prisoner's elderly mother, wife, and children all went to the court to listen to the hearing yesterday. When the hearing was over and they left the court, their faces were darkened, as if they were worried that the appeal would be hopeless.</p>
<h3>Ruling on the Appeal of the Parricide Case (Continued from Yesterday)</h3>
<p>The defendant does not have mental disorders or mental illnesses that cause loss of orientation." Furthermore, based on the direct trial by this court, the appellants are not only clear-headed and coherent in their confessions, but also try to recant their confessions and reduce their guilt. They are even more cunning than ordinary people, which is enough to prove that they are mentally sound and have no signs of exhaustion. Moreover, the appellants all claimed that they had no mental loss or exhaustion diseases, and Zhou Qinji even insisted that "the appeal statement states that I</p>
<p>Have a Mental Illness</p>
<p>Therefore, I do not agree. I only have a disease of physical weakness." Therefore, the defense of mental exhaustion in the appeal statement may be a misunderstanding of the physical weakness that the appellants relayed to their defense counsel, and there is no need to investigate further. As for the reason why the appellants jointly murdered their biological father, according to the testimony of their mother, Zhou Jing, their sister, Zhou Qinzhu, and their cousins, Chen Renjun and Chen Jing, and with reference to the appellants' confessions, it is believed that Zhou Yongjie's</p>
<p>Personality is Mean</p>
<p>And stingy, and he has been at odds with his wife, Zhou Jing, for many years, and often abuses her. Because he hates his mother and dislikes his sons, he not only forced the appellants to drop out of school, but also scolded and cursed them, considering it a common occurrence. Even the father and sons did not exchange a word for many years, and the affection of their natural nature was almost completely extinguished, and the thoughts of hatred and resentment increased day by day. Finally, the great defense of etiquette and teaching collapsed, leading to a tragedy in the family, which is not directly related to plotting for family property. However, it is found that our country's teaching emphasizes etiquette and teaching, and the first thing to value is filial piety. The great sin of parricide</p>
<p>Is Like a Beast</p>
<p>Therefore, except for cases where the father has filthy and unethical behavior and the juniors are motivated by righteous indignation, it is really an extremely evil act with no room for compassion (refer to the Ministry Order No. 5982 of the 24th year). Moreover, even as stated by the appellants, Zhou Yongjie's abuse of his wife during his lifetime was only mean and unkind, and his hatred of his sons was limited to dropping out of school and scolding. If the appellants wanted to compromise and seek perfection, why would they not have a way? They</p>
<p>Suddenly Developed the Idea of Killing</p>
<p>But after careful consideration and repeated planning, they actually brazenly used the scientific method of electric shock to kill their biological father in a brutal way, and did not hesitate to dismember, dismantle, and destroy the body to eliminate traces. Looking at the danger and toxicity of their intentions, the determination to kill, the cruelty of the methods, and the ferocity of the attitude, it is enough to prove that their conscience has been completely destroyed. If</p>
<p>They are not Punished with the Utmost Severity</p>
<p>How can we maintain etiquette and consolidate the foundation of the country? The original judgment, in accordance with Article 28, Article 272, Paragraph 1, Article 247, Paragraph 1 (the omission of the same law, Article 250), Article 55, Article 36, Article 37, Paragraph 1, and Article 38, Paragraph 1, Item 2 of the Criminal Law, appropriately sentences Zhou Qinji and Zhou Qinxiang to death, deprives them of their civil rights for life, and confiscates the iron scissors, saws, electric wires, and succession cables used to commit the crime. There is nothing wrong with that. Zhou Qinji and Zhou Qinxiang (to be continued)</p>
<h3>Weather Report</h3>
<p>The Xujiahui Observatory's weather forecast at 4:30 p.m. yesterday stated that Shandong and this area are sunny, with strong northerly to easterly winds. The coastal area south of Ma'an Island is cloudy, with some rain and drizzle, and northeasterly to southeasterly winds. Also, in the 24 hours before 3:00 p.m. yesterday, the highest temperature in this area was 77.4 degrees Fahrenheit and the lowest was 59.7 degrees Fahrenheit. On the same day last year, the highest was 76.8 degrees Fahrenheit and the lowest was 59.5 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>

<h3>Life and Death Unpredictable</h3>
<p>It is not strange to die and be reborn, but it is strange to be born and still die; it is not strange to be born and still die, but it is strange to die and not be allowed to live! This is truly a strange occurrence in the universe and a change in human ethics. Liang Bo was a villager from Dazhigu, Tianjin. The area is connected to Yantuo in the north and borders the Dongju Bureau. The villages have thousands of households and more than a dozen distilleries, so it is by no means a remote and poor area. Bo was a rogue in his youth. In middle age, he made a living by carrying firewood. This humble man had a mother who was over sixty years old. This spring, she fell ill. Medicine and scriptures were of no avail in curing her chronic illness. Bo watched her die and arranged for her burial, buying a coffin and covering her body. He observed the mourning period and wore mourning clothes, only regretting that his family had no wealth and the coffin was as thin as paper, leaving him with eternal regret! Three days after her death, monks were invited to chant scriptures, and people from Tianjin sent her on her way. On that day, the Buddhist instruments were noisy, and the chanting was intermittent. The family members cried loudly, but suddenly a faint sound of breathing was heard from inside the coffin. Upon closer inspection and repeated efforts, the crying stopped abruptly, and everyone was filled with shock and doubt. Some said it was a corpse turning into a demon. In Tianjin, it is customary to cover the deceased with gold or silver, or use yellow and white silk for the wealthy and colored paper for the poor. When Bo's mother was prepared for burial, these items were also used. Soon, the paper quilt rustled and moved, and the coffin sounded six times with knocking noises, indicating that she had come back to life. They used an axe to open the coffin and remove the nails. Sure enough, the mother's eyes moved, and she took a breath. But she died again six days later. After her death, she was placed in the same coffin as before. Before long, the coffin shook again as before. Bo thought, "Why is this old woman so troublesome?" and ignored it. The next day, the coffin was carried out.</p>

<h3>The Stock Market the Day Before Yesterday</h3>
<p>— By Someone</p>
<p>In the speculative market the day before yesterday, the foreign exchange rate rose sharply, causing a sudden contraction in the market, resulting in a chaotic situation beyond description. Those who fear that the world will not be in chaos and swim in troubled waters were probably sleepless last night. Even if they closed their eyes, they must have been awakened by nightmares.</p>
<p>Originally, the chaos in the "isolated island" market and the rise in prices were less due to external pressure and more due to speculation and manipulation. Looking at each change, it was caused by the waves created by the speculative market. Yesterday's situation was a deserved punishment for them. What is pitiful is that a group of blind followers also capsized in the depths of the troubled waters, even leading to more tragic endings.</p>
<p>This group of people can be divided into three categories: one is that life is not easy, and they think of trying their luck in the speculative market; the other is that they mistakenly believe the rumors that the legal tender is worthless and blindly "grab" for a while; the third is to simply engage in some activity, like gambling coins. Among these three categories, the first is of course the most pitiful. Life is already difficult, where do they get the capital to "speculate"? Luck does not come, but bad luck befalls them! The second type is pitiable in their foolishness and hateful in their intentions! If the legal tender is really worthless, what use is this little "savings" in hand? The third type believes that speculation is more stimulating than gambling, and they don't care about winning or losing. But no matter what their original intention or purpose is, in short, they help the "fishermen" create more rumors and indirectly cause the entire city's citizens to suffer.</p>
<p>Therefore, trying your luck is a dead end! Those who mistakenly believe that the legal tender is worthless will ultimately not be able to "transform" and enjoy themselves alone! Those who don't care about winning or losing would be fortunate to use these funds for urgent needs if they could take a broader view. Now that the dawn of victory is in sight, only rescuing the people is beneficial to oneself.</p>
<p>Please watch those "fishermen" bury themselves in the belly of the fish!</p>
<h3>Thoughts After the "Cleaning Workers' Strike"</h3>
<p>— By Zhizhi</p>
<p>As a result of the soaring prices of all commodities, what we see and hear is a scene of utter misery and cries for help! Furthermore, we can clearly see that the people most affected by high prices are naturally a group of hardworking workers and the lower-middle class who depend on their meager salaries for a living. This is a fact, a true and definite fact! Therefore, for the sake of their personal lives and the future livelihood of their families, in addition to reducing their consumption, trying their best to suppress and save, they still feel that their income cannot meet their expenses. The last path they can take is to cry out to their bosses for a raise! Looking at the labor disputes in several factories over the past year, the painful closure of several large companies due to unfulfilled demands from all employees, the strike of bus drivers, etc. The reason and crux of the city's cleaning workers' total strike starting this Sunday is the same.</p>
<p>In summary, the cleaning workers in this strike include road sweepers and garbage collectors. Here, we must first admit how important their work is! The sanitation of the entire city and the tidiness of the city appearance all depend on the continuous progress of this work. Therefore, the citizens of this city and the relevant authorities should immediately consult in an open and sincere manner to seek a reasonable solution so that the social situation can return to normal. Amidst great concern, the author would also like to offer some humble opinions below:</p>
<p>First, hopes are placed on the administrative authorities of the concessions. Originally, the Chinese government should have had a solution to the important issue of stabilizing prices in the city. However, given the special circumstances of the city at present, the government's power cannot reach the area for the time being. Naturally, the concession authorities, in order to maintain social stability and order, have the temporary power to act on behalf of our government in dealing with this matter. In the past, the authorities have already established measures to curb this, but for the sake of the current emergency, they should not hesitate to implement them vigorously to achieve the expected goal. Secondly, within the possible range, accept or revise the workers' reasonable demands so that they can return to work with peace of mind, and do not allow the strike situation to stagnate and prolong.</p>
<p>Second, great expectations are placed on all the workers. Your purpose this time is to seek a salary increase to solve your livelihood problems. Therefore, within the possible range, you can only consult in good faith and wait patiently for a solution. Do not allow others to take advantage of the situation and repeat your old mistakes.</p>
<h3>Offering Some Suggestions: How to Resist the "Petty Thieves Gang"</h3>
<p>— By Xinliang</p>
<p>After reading Qingxianjun's "Petty Thieves Gang," I immediately felt extremely frightened in my heart. It is truly unforgivable to "use coercive and tempting terror tactics to lead the small citizens of China into the path of bandits."</p>
<p>At that time, I discussed this issue with my friends. As a result of the discussion, we obtained the following points, which can directly and indirectly resist the activities of enticing the "Petty Thieves Gang":</p>
<p>Parents and teachers should pay attention to the behavior of children and elementary school students at all times. If there is any exceptional behavior, they should immediately investigate and inquire.</p>
<p>Never let children go out to play or watch movies alone.</p>
<p>Schools and families must properly preserve alumni directories, mailing lists, and the like to prevent villains from using these books for various frauds.</p>
<p>On ordinary days, elders should teach their children not to develop the habit of greedily eating candy or greedily watching movies. Most importantly, we must "set an example" for them.</p>
<p>Finally, I also hope that people outside the family and school can work together to help resist, and each of us should take responsibility for our younger generation.</p>
<h3>Sichuan Rice is Not Expensive, Less Than 20 Yuan Per Stone</h3>
<p>Yesterday, we received a letter from an anonymous reader: stating that in the "Recent Situation of Prices in Sichuan" published in this journal a few days ago, the item of rice price of ten yuan per dou did not specify the difference in weights and measures, which should be corrected. Because Sichuan is an area without a distinction, and the selling price reaches one hundred yuan per stone, which is enough to stimulate the excuses of Shanghai merchants. Little is known that Sichuan uses fifty catties as one dou, and twenty taels as one catty. One dou is equivalent to more than seventy catties of the market scale, which is less than twenty yuan per stone at Shanghai market prices.</p>
<h3>After the Rain, the Sky Clears</h3>
<p>— By Baotianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 24: Lake and Mountain Cleansing, Each with Their Own Merits; Men and Women Cheering Together, Shouting "Long Live"</p>
<p>At that time, the family tour vehicle set off for Jiaxing, which was also pre-arranged, and someone would entertain them. After eating, they immediately set off for Suzhou. Because this area is full of water towns, the natural scenery along the way is filled with continuous floods. But today they arrived at Anle Town, and Mrs. Suliyah was to see the hospital and infant hospital. They also wanted to go to Freedom Village and then measure the factory site of the two Miss He's silk weaving factory. Moreover, they had to rush back to Shanghai today, so they could not delay any longer. Pointing out the direction, the car drove straight to Anle Town. It turned out that when Zhu Airen was staying at the Huanhu Third Hotel in Huzhou last night, she made a long-distance call to Anle Town, telling Dr. Lao Zhang that Mrs. Suliyah and the newly married couple Lin Jiancheng and Jin Danyu would be coming to Anle Town tomorrow afternoon. Dr. Lao Zhang also wanted to fulfill a little bit of his responsibility to entertain them, because he knew that they would not come until the afternoon, he also prepared to open a tea party. At about 2:30 in the afternoon, sure enough, their family tour vehicle had arrived at the gate of the Women and Children's Hospital in Anle Town. Mrs. Su Hunya was originally well acquainted with Dr. Lao Zhang. Not only did they know each other in China, but they also knew each other when Dr. Lao Zhang was studying medicine in the United States. It was natural that they were very affectionate when old friends met again. Zhu Airen arrived at her own hospital as if she had arrived at her own home. She helped Dr. Lao Zhang to entertain everyone and let Mrs. Suliyah and Dr. Lao Zhang talk to each other. She led the Lin Jiancheng couple and Bu Huihua to visit various parts of the hospital. The two Miss He had lived here before, and they had seen every place, but today they also followed them for a walk. Of course, they had seen hospitals of all sizes, and this Women and Children's Hospital was really insignificant. But Zhu Airen said, "This is just a rural hospital. A rural hospital has many places that cannot be compared with hospitals in big cities. But a rural hospital must be viewed from another perspective. It must be economical and comfortable, so that patients can be physically and mentally healthy. Another principle is that rural hospitals must be widespread. Although since the revival of China, many hospitals have been added in various parts of the Chinese mainland in recent years. But in terms of the population ratio, China still lacks a lot of hospitals. With the strength of the country, it is often too late, which all depends on the general public's support for public welfare undertakings. Therefore, it is better to set up ten rural hospitals in the interior than to set up a large-scale hospital in a big city, which will save people more widely. Just imagine, if a village does not have a hospital within ten miles around it, how inconvenient it is for the villagers!" (279)</p>

<h3>Aromatic Movie Test Successful</h3>
<p>— By Xinliang</p>
<p>Opening a New Era in Film History; Twenty Different Scents Released from the Soundtrack; A Contribution from Swiss Inventors</p>
<p>Although the history of film is only fifty years old, the progress in these fifty years is truly amazing—from silent to sound, from sound to color to television; now, in the near future, we will have "aromatic movies." According to foreign reports, two Swiss inventors have invented a novel method that allows film to carry not only a soundtrack but also a so-called "scent" track, which can release the required scent when the film is screened.</p>
<p>The promotion of the so-called "aromatic movie" has been around for a long time; many people think it is worthless. Just imagine, people are now sitting quietly in movie theaters listening to the sound and dialogue on the sound film. If they are asked to stretch their noses to smell the scent on the film, that is really an annoying thing.</p>
<p>However, in fact, the "aromatic sound film" has finally met us humans in the world. About two months ago, the two Swiss inventors had a secret test in Berne, Switzerland. As a result, there were twenty different scents that could be released simultaneously with the sound from the soundtrack.</p>
<p>When a heroine in the film walks into a violet garden, the movie theater will be filled with the fragrance of violets. When she steps into the door of a hospital, the audience will smell the anesthetic.</p>
<p>"Please close your eyes and think about it." One of the two inventors said, "When the film shows a smoking room in a hotel, we will smell a strong cigar smell. Then—ha, ha—Gretel Garbo walks in, and a burst of powdery fragrance will immediately drive away the smoke." Really, it's too amazing!</p>
<p>When natural color movies were first invented, we had a joke. It is said that a person stood in front of a movie theater that was showing color films, with a sign hanging around his neck: "Please give me a penny, I am a poor colorblind person." Now, in the near future, maybe someone will stand behind him, but his sign will read: "Please give me a penny too, I have a bad cold today."</p>
<p>"Aromatic movies" will undoubtedly open a new era in film history. Here, let us thank these two Swiss inventors.</p>
<h3>The Five Actors of Fufeng</h3>
<p>— By Weiwo</p>
<p>Ma Yingliang will succeed Cheng Yanqiu in performing Huang Jin, which is expected to be another sensation. The supporting actors that Lian Liang brought this time are better than in the past, so I will write about them below:</p>
<p>Zhang Junqiu: One of the four famous dan actors, she is getting older. The four young dan actors are rising up, and they are expected to surpass their predecessors. Especially Junqiu, with her sweet voice and beautiful appearance, is very similar to Lanfang. Now that Fang is ill and her voice is gone, and Dezhu is abandoned by the people, only Shilai and Junqiu among the four young actors are the most prominent. Junqiu has a great reputation in Beijing, and she is undoubtedly the leader of the four young actors. One must look at her with new eyes after a few days of separation. Today's Junqiu is definitely not the same as before.</p>
<p>Wu Yanheng: He came to Shanghai with Song Dezhu last time and was greatly appreciated by the people of Shanghai. Although his art and Gao Shenglin are both followers of the Zhan school, their styles are different. In this autumn when martial arts talents are scarce, this is also a special talent.</p>
<p>Ma Fulu: Xiao Changhua will no longer come to the south at the age of sixty. The only clown actor from the north who can dominate the sea is Danglu alone.</p>
<p>Ye Shenglan: There are the most young male actors coming to the south to perform this time. There are Yu Zhenfei, Chen Shengtai, Li Debin, Jiang Miaoxiang, Zhou Weijin, and others. But the art of these people is not comparable to Shenglan. Shenglan has become the "king of young male actors" today.</p>
<p>Yuan Shihai: Among the rising painted-face actors, Shihai is the first person who can barely satisfy people. I am most impressed with Shihai. In the plays that Lian Liang performs, the painted-face roles are the most important. Now that he has Shihai, it will be even more exciting.</p>

<h3>Ouyang Yuqian Invites Actors to Guangxi</h3>
<p>— By Huicun</p>
<p>Nanhua Theater is About to Open</p>
<p>Ouyang Yuqian recently sent someone to Shanghai via Hong Kong to invite Peking Opera and drama actors to Guangxi. Because the Nanhua Theater presided over by Ouyang will be completed at the end of this month, it will be officially opened at the beginning of next month. The theater is directly affiliated to the Guangxi Provincial Drama Academy, and the academy subsidizes 9,000 yuan per month. The theater is divided into four: two for performing Guiju, one for performing Peking Opera, and one for performing drama. Guiju is supported by the famous Guiju actress Xiao Jinfeng, while Peking Opera and drama will invite actors from Shanghai to cooperate, and an ideal list has already been drawn up. Some people in Hong Kong believe that Jin Suqin, the leading Kunqu actress, should be the person intended by Ouyang Yuqian, but in fact, this is not the case, because Jin Suqin is not an easy person to recruit. Also, Xu Beihong presides over the painting part of the drama academy, and Ouyang himself presides over the drama.</p>
<p>Judging from the general situation, the Peking Opera actors who are more likely to enter Guangxi are Li Ruilai, Lü Junqiao, Ge Cijiang, and Li Shunlai in Shanghai. In addition to the majority of drama actors from Shanghai, a large number of drama actors from Hong Kong will also enter Guangxi. Li Hua, the former host of the China Art Troupe, has already joined, and the future drama work will probably be led and performed by Li Hua.</p>
<h3>The New Art Improved Peking Opera Troupe Left Shanghai for Ningbo Yesterday</h3>
<p>— By Haisheng</p>
<p>The New Art Improved Peking Opera Troupe organized by Yu Suilian, Li Shunlai, and others left for Ningbo on the Ruitai Lun yesterday. They have settled on the Tianran Stage and will perform on the 21st. The first play is "Liang Hongyu," with Suilian playing Liang Hongyu and Li Shunlai playing Han Shizhong. The later plays have not yet been decided. Originally, they were prepared to invite some troupe members in Shanghai, but the time was tight, and they did not have time to find them. Moreover, an unfortunate thing happened quietly, that is, two colleagues from the acting world, Wei Debao and Bian Shouyun, accepted their salary but privately ran to another dock to perform.</p>
<p>The members of the New Art Troupe were able to realize their aspirations, and the bright future was ahead, so everyone was excited and happy. They did not have any nostalgia for this isolated island like a cage. Yes, they are going to create a new life, shoulder the important mission, fulfill their due responsibilities, and open a path of transformation for the Peking Opera world. When I came back from the dock, I wished them to work hard and achieve final success and victory.</p>
