<p>社評</p>
<h3>歐洲戰爭的重要關鍵</h3>
<p>德國發動西綫戰爭，大舉進攻荷蘭比利時盧森堡，至今不過一旬，然數日之內，即下盧森堡荷蘭·而與英法會師於法國與比利時間，德國的用兵神速，眞是無可否認。</p>
<p>德國這决荷比戰役的成功，正和上决大戰中一樣；他採取了主動的攻勢，而協約國方面則取守勢，在戰術上，是德國佔先一着。德國以大軍侵入荷蘭，直逼洛脫丹，把荷蘭切爲兩截；另一路軍由列日向比京不魯塞爾推進，遂陷不魯塞爾而向法國邊境推進；更以左翼則攻破馬奇諾陣綫上的色當，以牽制聯軍；察其主力，還在右翼。如果德國集中兵力於右翼，向聯軍進攻，而聯軍也集中兵力作針鋒相對的防守，那末在這决戰中的形勢，又像上决大戰中一樣，變成一翼的競賽」，德軍右翼的開展，必至最西面的比國海岸始止。據德國海通社消息，稱「德國軍隊已迫近英倫海峽的杜佛對岸的某某法比重要砲台，此項進軍，與一九一四年如出一轍」云云，這種說明，自是實情。</p>
<p>從德國發動侵略荷比盧到現在，一鼓作氣，銳不可當，聯軍方面竟未能稍挫其鋒，倫敦巴黎爲之震驚。回憶上决歐戰，亦有類似的階段；及至德軍逼近了巴黎，經馬納河一役，纔遭頓挫；然則這一决聯軍固將在何時何地遏止德軍攻勢，這是舉世所關切的啊！雖然，歷史決不作機械式的複演；這决戰爭自有逈不同於往年者。析言其犖犖大端，上决德國應付兩面的作戰，西有英法，東有帝俄；這一决德國只是一面作戰，東方沒有蘇聯的牽制，這可以使他不再蹈上决的覆轍，而集中其兵力，貫澈其作戰計劃。這在上次大戰開始之初，德國西綫有一百師人，而英法方面只有七十二師，在兵力上是占絕對優勢；待東綫緊急後，被抽調去的達二十師，德國西綫，因此只存了八十師，而聯軍方面，陸續增加的結果，在馬納戰役的前夕，已達九十五師，寖寖乎駕德國而上之；因此之故，德國在克勒克指揮下的第一軍，本來由蒙斯向西南追逐英軍而趨巴黎的，突然改變計劃而向東南進行，其右翼乃致成爲英法軍隊攻擊的目標；加之，德國軍隊因長途行軍而告疲敝；後因德軍交通綫，自其根據地至法國境內，有二百英里之長，運輸上發生困難，都予法國霞飛將軍馬納戰役勝利的機會。德國受了上决失敗的敎訓，在兵力方面，這次必較充分，那是不問可知的事。並且二十年來。軍事科學的進展，一日千里，空軍之成爲這决戰爭中的重要力量，又足促使戰局爲之改觀。所以聯軍方面，在這决戰爭中，企圖挫折德國進攻的銳勢，形成相持的陣地戰，其困難的程度，較之上次歐戰，殆有過之無不及。</p>
<p>法總司令甘茂林將軍日前策勵全國將士的演辭謂「大戰業已開始，此一戰爭實爲我國與各同盟國曁整個世界運命所繫。……凡我將士，苟不能前進，母髯戰死。。吾人唯有遵守一句格言：即不勝即死是也。」這與霞飛將軍一九一四年九月在馬納前線命令中語句正相同。霞飛謂：「在國家安寗所繫的戰爭將開始的一瞬間，我感覺我必須促君等注意者，目前已非後退之時了。一切力暈須集中於反攻，逐退敵人。不能進展之軍隊，必須不顧一切，保持已獲之陣地，寗可保持陣地而死，不可後退而生。」目前德國軍隊，雖大部分仍在比國境內，尙未深入法境，但由甘茂林將軍的演辭，可見法國方面即已不惜一切，準備悉力作戰，以挫折德軍的銳勢。由巴黎傳來消息。謂「德軍的坦克車隊，因法方反攻的銳猛，致其向巴黎進迫的企圖失敗而全被限遏，並倒退九英里。」這當然不足爲德國銳勢已竭的明證，也不足視爲英法勝利的先聲，但由德軍的勢如破竹，轉變而爲雙方相持之局，則不能不視此九英里爲其中的重要符節。至於最後勝利的確定，在時間上距離今日猶遠。</p>

<h3>邱吉爾廣播　承認大局嚴重　以動人之詞表示決心　採嚴峻步驟剛毅作戰</h3>
<p>倫敦　首相邱吉爾、昨夜向全國及帝國作播音演說、以動人之辭、表示對法軍與其領袖之堅強信任、並表示作戰之剛毅決心、降俟獲得勝利而後巳、</p>
<p>堅強信任　法軍領袖</p>
<p>首相曰、余已接法蘭西共和國諸領袖、尤其爲剛强的總理萊諾之至莊嚴的保證、聲明無論前途若何變化、彼等必作戰到底、其結果或爲苦痛、或爲光榮、然吾人如作戰到底、則所能獲者、厥爲光榮而已、</p>
<p>首相續謂、假使此爲法、英兩國久長歷史中最可驚駭的時代之一、然亦爲最高尙的時代之一、此爲毫無疑義者、英、法幽國人民駢肩而立、除獲其所蔭蔽之大自治領與廣大帝國之親友援助外、絕無其他援助、今復駢肩而進、以拯救不特歐洲、且爲人類、晚離至可卑鄙、至可摧毀靈魂的暴虐者之毒害、此暴虐者已使歷史諸頁爲之黯汚矣、</p>
<p>處於彼等之後、處於吾人之後、處於英、法陸軍與艦隊之後者、有若干殘破之國家與被壓之民族、即捷克、波蘭、挪威、丹麥、荷蘭、比利時是、野蠻主義之長夜、今將降臨彼等、苟非吾人戰勝、則縱有希望之星辰、亦不足破之、第吾人必須戰勝、且將戰勝、</p>
<p>雙方皆處　危險地位</p>
<p>余今日在吾國、帝國、吾人、協約國生活中莊嚴之一時、第一次以首相之資格向君等致詞、尤要者、爲因自由之故、而作此陳述也、慘烈之大戰、刻方在法國與佛蘭特斯進行中、德軍已藉天空之猛烈轟炸與重鐵甲坦克車之助、在馬奇諾防綫之北突破法軍之防務、彼等大批鐵甲車輛、現正蹂躪平野、此平野也在最初一二日中、絕無守軍、德軍現已深進、且於沿途散播驚恐與紛擾、處其後者有滿載步兵之卡車、卡車之後、尙有大隊士兵、源源前撲、於是法軍乃重行分配、以抗敵軍、且予打擊、此伸出之楔、進行閱數日、而多賴王家空軍英勇之戰績以助成之、吾人今不得因此種鐵甲車輛突臨吾人陣綫後之各處、而爲之震驚、如彼等已達吾人陣後、則法軍亦在許多地點戰於敵軍陣綫之後、雙方現皆處於極危之地位、如法軍與我軍能善事應戰、余信其必能如是、如法軍能保持其久已馳譽之克復與反攻之天才、如英軍能堅忍而苦戰、此在往日、已有許多例證則戰局大有突然轉變之可能、</p>
<p>惟在今日、若圖掩飾大局之嚴重、則屬愚妄、若心喪氣餒、或認久經訓練配備精利之大軍三四百萬人、能在數星期中或數月中爲機械化之車輛疾撲或襲擊所克服、則愚妄尤甚、蓋機械化之車輛縱屬兇猛、亦決無此能力也、吾人對法國陣綫之穩固、大可具有信心、而英、、法健兒在此鏖戰之中、必能表現其品質堪與敵軍匹敵、此可拭目以覘之者也、</p>
<p>就余個人而論、對於法軍與其領袖之信心、實不可搖撼、今法軍從事鏖戰者、僅佔全數之一小部分、法國土地之被侵入者、亦僅佔全國之一小部分、現有良好證據證明敵軍實際已將其特殊機械化之部隊全數加入大戰、吾人更知彼等已受甚重大之損失、</p>
<p>恢復主動　有賴驍勇</p>
<p>凡與敵軍遭遇、而在密接部分交綏者、無論爲軍官或士兵、無論爲旅團或師團、皆能於總結果作有價値之貢獻、軍隊當局以列於天然障礙堅固陣綫之後、抵禦敵軍之攻擊爲能事、此種思想、必須放棄、而當知欲恢復主動之地位、必有賴於驍勇不屈之衝擊、此種精神不特當鼓舞高級指揮、且當使每一戰士皆具之、吾人在天空之中、輒以寡勝衆、衆寡之懸殊、往往爲三四對一之比、英、德空軍之實力平衡、現已使吾人處於優勢、而與戰事爆發時逈乎不同、吾人不特爲自己應戰、目爲法軍應戰、而使德國之轟炸機數爲之日减、余對於吾人空軍與德空軍作戰到底之信心、已因過去及目前進行之兇猛戰鬥而更堅矣、同時吾人之重轟炸機、現已打擊德國機械化力量之根本、蓋彼等已重創納粹稱覇世界的努力所直接依賴之煉油廠也、今料於數日中摧毀荷蘭、而使成爲一片灰燼之敵軍、一俟西綫臻於安穩、必轉而以撲吾人、此吾人當置於意料中者也、</p>
<p>勉勵國民　為國服務</p>
<p>當余言及吾人已準備應付此種打擊、且將堅忍之、並將視不成文的戰事法律之所許而報復之之際、余敢決余乃向國民之全體發言、他日禍患降臨本島、每一男子、每一女子咸分担吾人前綫子弟如陸兵，水兵、飛行員所受之危險、並因以至少减去前綫所受强襲之一部分，則彼等必可中心安慰甚至可以自豪也、在此一時、凡屬國民、其不應盡其力之所能、以爲國服務乎、吾人如望戰爭得以獲勝、則必須以源源增多之軍械子彈供給國民之需要、吾人必須從速多製飛機·坦克車·大砲子彈、凡此重要軍火、所需至巨、此可增厚吾人實力、以抵抗武裝犀利之敵軍、此可彌補增强戰鬥中之耗費、前綫戰士旣知所耗費之軍火能予迅速補充、則對於儲備充足之軍火、必將用之益速也、</p>
<p>吾人之任務、不僅爲博取一戰之勝利、目爲博取全局之勝利、俟法境目前大戰可以减少力量時、則本島之大戰將興矣、所謂本島者、乃指不列顚全部言也、吾人在此最高度之急難中、將毫不猶豫、而取種種步驟、甚至至嚴峻之步驟、以發揮吾人所能盡之最後努力也、</p>
<p>產業之利益與夫工作之時間、以較生活與榮譽之奮鬥、則實不値一顧、蓋生活與自由、實爲吾人人人所賴以圖存者也、余已接法國諸領袖至莊嚴之保證、聲明無論前途變化若何、必作戰達到勝利之目的而後已、余受國王之付託、已組成各黨男婦幾包括各種意見之政府、吾人往日輒因意見歧異而相爭論、今則已團結一致、從事戰爭、不至勝利不休、無論代價若何巨大、苦痛若何深切、吾人決不屈爲奴隷、而蒙恥辱也、（二十日路透社電）</p>

<h3>北平日偽方面　對南京政權甚冷淡　依然採用舊五色旗　獨立地位未受影響</h3>
<p>字林西報五月四日北平通訊云、北平曾於四月二十五日至二十七日、慶祝「新政權」成立、然民衆與當道、皆抱漠然態度、各處絕少慶祝之象、縱一二通衢所紥紙花牌樓、亦無說明慶祝意義之旗幟或標語、太和門前舉行「民衆大會」、到者</p>
<p>寥若晨星、演說者就擴音機發表沉長演說、千篇一律、縱力竭聲嘶、亦未引起聽衆之絲毫興趣、從四週鄉區來市參加大會之代表、有大隊警察隨同到會大的係防此等「自動」與會代表半途逸回、尤可注意者、此次雖係慶祝「新政權」之成立、但未見其「國民黨旗」、遊行者皆持</p>
<p>舊王色旗、日方發言人曾加以掩飾曰、「此乃華人純粹自動的慶祝、日人當然不能干涉、再發起遊行之新民會、乃採取五色旗者、」然該發言人對華人旣係慶祝「新政權」、則何以持「新民會」旗幟一節、期期未能予以解釋、縱予解釋、無補於事、因</p>
<p>華北日人、多已公開表示甚憎厭在政權也、中南海公園舉行正式慶祝時、王克敏及其他「華北政委會委員」曁日方高級文武官員致詞、殆未有述及在及其政權者、所言皆係取締共黨與前途仍多困難之類、此間華字報紙稱華北公共行政機關、日後皆將冠以「華北」字樣、而取銷前此所用「中央」字樣、興亞院近在此間舉行特別會議、商得何種決議、絕未披露、事殊可奇、謠傳會議後所以寂然無聲者、乃因華北方面與「新政權」間　在</p>
<p>財政問題上發生困難所致、此皆明示華北政權之目的、與獨立地位、絕未受「新政權」成立之影響、此間方慶祝新政權成立時、華方正規軍適攻開封、誠大煞風景事也、重慶方面所稱擊斃日兵二千名一節、已由日方予以否認、然華方正規軍</p>
<p>攻入開封中心、確屬事實、此役經過、似係華軍於侵晨出開封小隊日駐軍之不意、突施襲擊、衝入市區中心、雖於日方援軍開到後退出、然華軍即獲此短促之勝利、亦已使</p>
<p>日軍威望大受打擊、蓋日軍曾一再自詡整個華北、現已綏靖也、此事且可證實外籍軍事觀察家屢次表示之意見、即日方現圖以不足之軍力保持鄕區、茍遇華軍攻擊、則處境極危是、晋南方面、亦傳來不斷劇戰之消息、此可由</p>
<p>大批傷兵與屍灰源源北返一事證實之、縱北平市郊、亦不寗靜、渾河彼岸山堍、戰事賡續不絕、的四天前、華方正規軍在長辛店南要道上截獲長途汽車一輛、由此可得結論、即東京方面如果眞信在政權之成立、能迅使中國終止武裝抵抗、或在短期間解決「中國事變」、則未免過於樂觀矣、</p>
<h3>潮揭兩軍爭制勝點　靑麻山楓溪間爭奪甚烈</h3>

<h3>金價慘跌不已　最低降至五千二百三十元　收盤前港幫忽起活動傾進</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤市况、續於倒瀉之中、一度慘降至五千二百三十元、幾有創入五千元關內之勢、尙賴最後買風得回升、達五千五百元收盤、但較上週末已暴跌三百六十五元、論買賣情况、首感跌仆過巨、成交並不甚夥、乃一般投機者、俱無下嘴之處、惟搶帽子性之交易而已、晨初即撳一百六十五元、此因歐局戰事、恊的國受挫、不利多方之故、開槃爲五千七百元、繼以外匯奇鬆、塲內銀號力售、旋又小達五千六百元、嗣傳聞英法軍事轉捷、激動扒戶、提高一百餘元、終奈上述消息、不久漸散、其時金號銀號入市拋賣、且銀樓帮亦塞出不少、雖某金號及證券帮居間吸收、卒因衆寡懸殊、而吿在落至五千四百七十元、午刻銀號補空五千五百元爲午收價、後市外匯愈硬、由開盤五千四百二十元、再壓至五千二百三十元全日低價中受證券帮大量沽出、及銀號賤售、影響最巨、但頃間匯市回緊、現金號曁銀樓帮均進、又某銀樓及金號暗代港帮搜購、買風陡起、致收盤跳達五千五百元、較上星期六午收軋低三百六十五元、全日交易頗暢、的四千餘兩、銀樓飾金結果掛小三十元、海關金等仍平、</p>
<p>烚赤跌三百六十五元</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）、初以匯市吿鬆、及報載歐洲戰事、聯軍方面不利、致人心散漫、一片賣出、開市即在跌一百六十五元、乃銀號出金號十兩、爲五千七百元、繼因外滙依然報硬、銀樓業互相吐出、同時銀就亦塞、續小一百元、銀樓帮出銀號二十兩、為五千六百元、嗣乃市上忽傳歐洲聯軍方面戰事轉機、而滙市鬆勢稍定、激起買戶、金號及散戶均有拖入、遂得回升一百二十元、銀號出金號十兩、爲五千七百二十元、卒因外滙重吿猛鬆、再起賣風、金號及銀號吐出尤多、不久即在落二百四十元、銀號出銀樓業五十兩、爲五千四百八十元、期時某金號見低力買、爲數極大、的有一千兩之上、遂又回高一百二十元、金號進銀號二十兩、爲五千六百元、第因銀號帮復來猛塞、而某金號已中止吸收、重又慘落一百三十元、金號互做三十兩、爲五千四百七十元、將近收盤時、金號稍來撈入、再又回大六十元、銀號進證券帮二十兩、爲五千五百三十元、惟午收因證券帮塞出、仍祗五千五百元、午後開時賣氣瀰漫、一跌八十元、證券帮出銀號三十兩、爲五千四百二十元、嗣賴錢兌業金號稍撈、曾回漲三十元、金號進銀號十兩、爲五千四百五十元、但不久因匯市步鬆、再加證券帮銀號等多頭巨額出籠、遂猛瀉二百二十元、銀號出金號十兩、爲五千二百三十元、後以現金號及銀樓業撈進、且某金號及某銀樓頻代客帮搜買、而匯市亦報回軟、一時售者漸少、遂見回升二百八十元、金號出錢兌業十兩、爲五千五百十元、繼而金號進銀樓二十兩、爲五千五百元作晚收價、結果比上週六軋跌三百六十五元、收後市勢續見回挺、五千五百六十元曾有成交、現金號之本牌金售出價、照烚赤較高十元、收進减低三十元、現標金照掛脾金低五十餘元、均鮮做開、</p>
<p>飾金改懸五百七十元</p>

<h3>外幣跌勢益厲　直至傍晚稍回</h3>
<p>昨日外幣市况、英美金鎊隨金價繼續暴落達七元之巨、英金票以黑市英滙有鬆無已、故各方供塞不絕，市價甚軟、美金票上午已步退至十六元九角半、午後更傳關於巴黎消息、致曾退至十六元五角、迨至四時光景、及聞香港平準會忽有傾扒外匯訊、致人心始吿安定、晚市升爲十七元三角、但比上週六仍跌四角半、香港票隨港滬匯兌大跌一角八分、此外如法郞票，及新加坡·羅比·坎拿大菲列濱·等票、莫不趨疲、日余票供給亦暢、晚市退爲一元一角一分、朝鮮票供求尙勻、晚市仍爲九角二分、</p>

<h3>紗花　浮多斬結　紗市活動　雙馬再跌七十五元</h3>
<p>紗市續挫、且跌風驟熾、此因歐戰愈陷糾紛之途、故美印棉慘落、於是人心惶恐、投機者心神不安、浮多忍痛斬結、以致市盤動搖、但香港帮對二十支雙馬及十支粗紗需要甚殷、稍能挽救頹勢、</p>
<p>現紗晨開市塲紊亂如蔴、叫喊者不一、廿支雙馬現貨價爲一千三百零五元、少頃聞外匯放長、黃金下挫、賣勢立刻滯厚、直跌至一千二百元、旋聞廣帮對於雙馬有生意、又見回好幾十元、査半日間成交統計二千八百七十包、行情二十支雙馬跌七十五元、茲將各帮口買去之額量、分列如左、</p>
<p>同行　七〇五寗波　一六五</p>
<p>香港二、〇〇〇統計二、八七〇</p>
<h3>洋花頻跌　本棉交易停頓</h3>
<p>本棉交易完全入於停頓之途、此因歐戰愈擴大、美印棉頻頻下跌、同時紗市不振、以致人心驚慌、大家都束手旁待矣、</p>
<p>另訊外棉市價、紐的棉市、先因利物浦及孟買帮之在市賣出四萬包之巨、棉價跌落四十餘磅音、續後稍轉穩定、結果收盤市價、較之上日跌落三十磅音、印度市况頗爲疲乏、收盤降磅二十餘羅比、預測回漲、結果較之上日跌六羅比、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、日來海外市况之低落、及歐洲形勢之複雜、各方暫擬略抱觀望、故交易較爲靜寂、然一般預溯印棉將與日本訂的，以棉易紗、故印棉見漲云、茲將昨日棉市以美滙五元半、折合美棉期貨送廠價如下、</p>

<p>印棉今明有連續而到、聞今日大英公司把特凡（譯音）號郵船到滬、由孟買裝來棉花一千七百五十件、停靠浦東其昌棧起卸、又意輪康梯拉柴號（譯音）的明日到滬、由喀爾喀塔裝來棉花一千三百四十五噸、屆時停靠虹口公和祥碼頭起卸、</p>
<h3>證券　外股跌風難戢　內債漲勢尙勁</h3>
<p>證券晤盤、昨日市况、因外滙愈長、金子愈小、人心漸定、市上公債補空及新多均有與起、甲種冉出六十元、丙戊種亦均衝出五十元、市氣甚好、目下情形大都利於長多短空、特惜銀根太緊、多方終有束縛、不能展其所長耳、午前交易平淡、午後交易驟多、聯和搜購甚力、鴻大德孚亦有相當進胃、久豐益昌天生補空做多、亦均有興趣、鴻康始終賣出同順協大亦逢高拋售、市面買氣甚旺、散戶亦進多出少、趨勢顯有盤旋上騰之象、結果各債一致漲六七角、成交總數的計一百三十萬元左右、茲列簡明表於後、</p>

<p>上週六之紐約股市、雖已在大跌風中站住、本埠股市開盤、人心似覺不振、此無疑由於一般人對目下正在法國北部進行之大規模戰爭之未來結果、懷有疑懼、但戰爭爲一種長時間之角力、故一時即使小受挫折、亦祗能視爲暫時逆轉、根本無最後的或決定的意味在內、市况虛軟之最大原因、自是對於戰事方面消息略感失望、其次則爲買方維持能力之缺乏、昨日各股價格、跌落均鉅、午前半小時內甚有回漲之象、無奈下午謠諑繁興致價重又回小、爲避免種種麻煩起見、按照倫教市塲慣例、嗣後各股之已由公司方面宣布派息、發紅股或其他新股諸事者、概在停止過戶時之同星期中、以除息除權、除紅股等之價交易、</p>

<h3>糧食　天熱米易變　售從紛紛跌</h3>
<p>米市猶呈軟色、且全市自始至終一路平疲、早市初開因隔昨星期休業一朝、勢難把握、賣買雙方均袖手觀望、直迨中市始稍活動、及後又聞金縮匯長、及紗棉一致趨下之訊、人心更虛、羣謀亟脫、市面變化之劇烈、蓋歐戰風雲劇變、一般投機者亦惕於市勢之危機四伏、不敢出手、反形匿跡、全市銷塲僅有零星之實胃、致結果成交旣寥、而各貨價祇有半元上落、</p>
<p>洋米被　縮金跌影響、晨間開價即逐步趨疲、午後賣氣更旺、浮囤爭脫於先、大戶繼出於後、跌風愈猛、小絞米‘早市開價尙爲四十七元、午市四十六元四角收市、下午被金市震盪、一度慘跌至四十四元半、收市稍定、結果回至四十五元、比之上週末收價已狂落二元半以上、其他各米午市收價均小數角至元許、下午則續小一元及一元半不等、英華司原包二號西貢降開五十六元四角、亦較小二三元、</p>
<p>又訊本市自國米運滬遭阻後、來源斷絕、米價因之猛漲、洋米乘機活躍、經營之行家、紛向越暹訂購、已往二個月間、洋米進口數驚人、各堆棧竟有被塞滿之脫、近兩週來、洋米之進口、已逐漸减少、洋米之價格、向較國米爲賤、今已相等、而或有高出國米之價、此種景象、對於平民生　　淺、希望米業界設法抑制　　維平民生計、茲悉昨日怡和洋行泰生輪釗　、由香港運來洋米四千四百六十一包、停靠羅斯福碼頭起卸、（祖）</p>
<p>厚薄粳等國米、來源續旺、計到三千餘包、其中杜粳佔有三分之二、因之傳聞塲外暗盤更廉、天時悶熱、人心更浮、均在甩價脫出、做開粳價跌落元奇、無錫淸粳四十九元、紛粳四十八元、常崑粳四十七元、不過薄稻與早稻到貨較稀、略貶三五角、靑泗特薄五十元、大市四十八九元、南港早稻特四十七八元、决之四十六元云云、</p>
<p>糯米雖爲應令時貨、然到貨亦旺、且受塲外粳米暗盤之影響、銷塲淸淡售價並降元砠、開金溧特元四十三元半至四十三元、常丹白七四十二元半、次之四十元外、</p>
<h3>麵粉廠盤　減低二角</h3>
<p>紛市萎頓、本街交易、淸淡逾恒、客銷更無熱烈之望、兼之金價暴跌、各種物價回小之際、人心虛弱、可見一斑、故二號粉廠盤、亦减爲十三元八角比上週回降二角、老本牌回籠粉上午開過十三元八角半、午後已無人接受、其餘內地雜牌粉亦莫不跟小一角至角外、統市各粉成交的計五千包左右、市面前途、殊鮮樂觀、</p>
<h3>油餅　豆油疾退　豆餅尙堪支持</h3>
<p>豆油依然疲憊、全日市　震盪、頗爲紊亂、結果賣氣籠罩、行情續瀉四五元不等、計開大連豆油三百桶、價自九十六元跌至九十二元、烟岐豆油五十件，六十八元、大有廠油九十担、六十九元、潤豐廠油五十桶、七十元、豆餅銷塲本方興未艾之時、但受環境牽制、潛勢缺乏興奮、邇來華南各幫、一致觀望、惟內地尙有問津、故大局得以支持、昨計成交大有餘廠四牌餅三千片、價自十元零六角半至三十元零九角、同甡廠甡記餅二千五百片、十元至十元零一角半、烟台餅五百片、十元零五角、</p>
<h3>疋頭　棉布人心浮動　北幫午後　猛收東疋</h3>
<p>布市晨開步跌午後稍見回昂、蓋以外匯續鬆、人心浮動、囤戶不絕傾吐、客戶又抱觀望態度、後市以北幫奮力吸收東貨細布、人心轉堅、全日交易做開數額零星，本街　計一百數十件、浙贛粤各幫辦色布·粗布近百件、售盤參差不一、細布斜紋跌每疋一元左右、粗布平平、各廠漂染布亦多數减盤、綸昌豪俠藍布新價每疋六十二元、較原盤降落十元、</p>
<p>東布白貨龍頭細布晨市目四十一元跌至三十九　收盤、後市開盤人心虛怯、賣風更熾、最小價慘落至每疋三十七元二角半、四君子嗶嘰跌至每碼一元〇六分半、迨至四時許、天津秦皇島等幫忽來旺辦現期貨細布、成交六七百件、本街同業亦乘勢收進、市氣轉變、龍頭收盤升至四十元〇五角、嗶嘰一元一角三分許、今日（二十一日）起市塲通吿、因天熱下午停止營業、祗做半天、</p>
<h3>絲茶　杭嘉繭行開秤　無錫蠶汛良好</h3>
<p>浙路杭嘉一帶之繭行業已開秤、惟到貨不多、土種繭開一百八十元、杜洋種繭二百五十元、折算成本、因燃料等價昂貴、每擔新廠絲當在四千二百元上、今春蠶農頗多自行繅絲、蓋　諸上年經騐，售繭頗不合算、目下白土絲每百兩價一百六十元、以一千六百兩計、每擔輯里式白土絲之絲本當在二千六百元綫、總之今庚絲本甚重、而國外市塲之把握、又甚渺茫、</p>
<p>錫邑叫鄉蠶事、發靑均甚順利、早帮已大眠開葉兩朝、晚幫亦已三眠開葉、葉價最近每擔十一元至十二元、現下尙無過度缺乏桑葉現象發生、（良）</p>
<h3>日絲猛甩　本市歐銷沉寂　怡和已拋新絲</h3>
<p>橫濱現貨一千五百三十元、跌十元、近期一千五百四十元、跌三十元、遠期一千五百五十五元、跌二十五元、</p>
<p>本埠絲市、怡和洋行已拋開新絲、計白廠經七八分價五千零五十元、共三十包、陳絲交易並不多見、輯里正牌價二千六百元、達昌等進二十擔、歐洲絲銷相形見拙、</p>
<h3>糖市　粗白步軟</h3>
<p>昨粗白據荷蘭電訊、每幾轟　美金四·八〇、合價漸宜、兼之外匯　長、　乃步軟、公會劃盤、現貨二四粗白外棧貨初爲七十元至六十九元、後爲六十九元半至六十九元、跌二元半、轉口貨五十五元、跌三元許、太古車白降度較差、B嘜的跌尤半、爲八十三元、國糖號盤雖欲堅持、但洋糖旣已慘落、未能獨佔優勢、亦呈沉寂之象、</p>
<h3>南北貨　南告乏</h3>
<p>南塘芡　、遞來到貨絕跡、市存已將斷檔、故稍有手貨者、高叫三百元、池芡仍平、淨貨八十元、普通七十五元、聞門市南芡售價每不不及三元云、</p>
<h3>海味　西谷米與胡椒　市機俱見挫跌</h3>
<p>近日外滙回鬆、故凡屬洋貨、俱見挫跌、刻市大小粒西谷米同售九十元、比前小去十元、黑大椒爲一百二十五元、白椒一號二百十元、二號一百九十元、三號一百六十元、亦跌二三十元、頗有成交、</p>
<h3>五金　會司鐵祇靠廠銷</h3>
<p>馬口鐵正號貨、現甚單薄、且開價非常堅昂故廠需大都以會司鐵是問因其行情較馬口鐵爲康故　、査該貨之另　去路、爲華北及華南諸客商、聞最近以來、該數幫需胃甚少、因而交易　不甚暢、故刻市會司鐵去路、僅爲本街　隅之廠家而已，昨市成交　三百箱之譜、標準仍屬高昂、二百磅老鋼廠每箱沽二百二十元、新鋼廠每箱喊二百元左右、</p>
<h3>平摺鐵　頗受長江幫歡迎</h3>
<p>平摺會司鐵、流通於市、爲時未久、已得各廠家之歡迎、昨市由長江路客商搜去百餘箱、作罐頭原料之用、價每箱一百六一元、（合二扎爲一箱即每扎沽八十元）、</p>

<h3>市商會地懇切勸告　各商店抑平物價　以薄利多賣公平定價相勉　兩租界取締投機意志堅決</h3>
<p>上海市商會昨爲物價問題、發表吿全市商界書云、全市商界公鑒、近半年來、物品漲價、超越常軌、民生困苦、前所未有、當此時艱、縱不能有無相通、患難相恤、亦何忍人飢獨飽、乘危取利、敢竭愚忱、盡其忠吿、近來物價高漲、其惟一藉口理由、即爲外匯與國幣折合率之升騰、須知民間日用所需、產自中土、究居多數、外匯之伸縮、並不完全影響於成本之高低、商人將本求利、應以各該物品產地之成本、沿途之費用、本店之開支、累積計算、定其盈餘標準、</p>
<p>價隨外匯倒行逆施</p>
<p>今則凡有物品、不論其國產非國產、幾無不隨黃金外匯爲轉移、此種辦法、實近於倒行逆施、况外匯高漲、亦祗能影響於購自國外尙未結價之貨品、其零售商店、早已買進、尙未佔罄之存貨、實屬絲毫無關、乃朝聞外匯漲價之信、夕即爲貨價加碼之舉、隨聲附和、是何居心、况外匯漲則貨價隨之俱漲、外匯跌則貨價並不隨之俱跌、亦有貨價一漲、動輒數成、而跌價則極其細微、聊資點綴、藉避人言、凡此行徑、實所痛心、</p>
<p>悖入悖出　古有明訓</p>
<p>國家遭此振古未有之艱難、人民遭此自昔未有之流離、如果利用機會、朘削同胞之血肉以自肥、詎得厠於冠帶之倫、神明之胄、本會以爲悖入悖出、昔有明訓、薄利多賣、經商至理、民生日用必需之品、定價務宜公平、凡非來自國外之貨、切勿以外匯爲藉口、當此交通不便、運輸遲滯之際、尤應熟察供求所需、隨進隨賣、切勿大量囤積、掯住不售、以人爲之策略、造成缺貨之恐慌、自謂大利所在、可以一網打盡、須知本市現在情形、民衆生活普遍之困難、巳喚起租界當局深切之注意、凡自詡趁此政綱失馭、可以惟所欲爲者、終必有古語所謂「請君入甕」之時、及今改悔猶未爲晚、掬誠奉吿、諸希亮察、</p>
<p>公共租界　意向堅決</p>
<p>公共租界工部局、以若干星期前、黑市外匯發生劇變後、本埠價物、曾一度高漲、今匯市巳見放長、法幣價格回漲、與劇變前情形相較、已不相上下、而本埠商人、並求將物價實行减低、甚至有若干商店、其物價有繼續上漲之趨勢、曾於十八日分函有關係各商業團體、飭令商店减低物價、但如繼續索價過分、並再圖破壞工部局所訂改善社會生活狀况之辦法、不得不從嚴取締、茲據大中社記者探悉、除非物價宣吿下跌、投機之風、不再存在於市塲之中、則租界當局、決將採取强硬有力之步驟、</p>
<p>兩租界採同一步驟</p>
<p>公共租界工部局方面、現正就最近物價、加以硏究、準備於最近期內、對本市商人、將採取一法律上之行動、又悉、工部局現正與法租界公董局密切合作、採同一步驟、務使此種措置、發生宏效、至外間所謂法租界當局希望公共租界當局與之合作、統制物價取締投機云云、實則公共租界與法租界當局、現已在最有效之狀况下、較前更爲合作、彼此間在互助合作下、統制物價、取締投機、不僅希望已也、</p>
<p>囤貨者之　嚴重敎訓</p>
<p>本埠華商之從事投機在熱、從未有今日之盛、彼等不特購買外匯外股、並且囤積美貨、不意此次美國物價及股票連續慘跌、而外匯亦步步猛長、正是雪上加霜、多重虧損、故損失之鉅實爲上海有史以來所罕見、據可靠之佔計、至昨午止、單就各大投機華人之虧損總數、當折合法幣達一萬萬元以上、其中美貨　股損失爲五千萬元以上、外匯損失爲五千萬左右、而其他小投機家及一般囤積美貨以外物品、與購買美股以外外股者、尙不在內也、</p>
<p>投機技窮　煤價續跌</p>
<p>本埠煤市、因金價回漲、投機者無從施其伎倆、囤戶紛紛拋售、而現又値煤市淸淡時節、銷路呆滯、致煤價連續下跌、昨日煤屑價格、父自每噸一百五十二元、下跌四元、計每噸爲一百四十八元、煤球價格、每噸亦下跌六元、自一百四十元跌至一百卅四元、惟各煤球另售店之售價、頗不一致、與當局之平價法則、殊有違背、甚盼各另售店予以糾正、自動抑低價格、</p>
<h3>黃金昨又慘跌　黑匯繼續鬆長　內債飛俏昨又漲七八角</h3>
<p>昨日本埠黑市塲之金融市况、黃金又起鉅大跌風、一度曾跌至五千二百二十元、與上星期六收盤相較、慘跌共達六百四十五元之鉅、惟收盤爲五千五百三十元、但亦軋跌三百三十五元、至於黑滙、亦呈狂烈猛鬆、昨日收盤時、現貨英滙爲四便士二三四三七五、現貨美滙亦長至五元七八一二五、黑滙於本月月初、猛烈緊縮、經連日回鬆、已相差無幾、金價且已回跌、超過月初在漲以前之市價、因此所有各項物品市價、殊應一致回跌、但因零售店之唯利是圖、平尺尙未獲其惠、但必難持久也、總之黃金慘跌、黑滙在鬆、對於法幣價値、益見堅强、實屬毫無疑義、是以昨日內債父飛黃騰達、各種統債、躍升七八角不等、反之外國股票、續見傾瀉、</p>
<p>黑滙鬆長原因</p>
<p>此次金價慘跌、黑匯狂鬆、其原因爲（一）中日戰事、華方連獲大捷、最後勝利、不但有絕對把握、且已完成獲得最後勝利之局勢、（二）日方需要法幣、收購淪陷區農產、黑滙亦有大量拋出、（三）南洋如荷屬東印度·新加坡·以及華南香港等地之外匯、深恐爲各該當局統制、大量流滬、（四）歐戰嚴重消息、刺激人心看下、（五）所有牽涉歐戰之各國在滬銀行以及傳說即將參戰之歐洲某國銀行等、存戶紛紛提存、不得不拋出黑滙、以換法幣應付、</p>
<p>國債價均堅漲</p>
<p>自鄂豫等地華軍捷報頻傳、同時財政部對統一公債到期本息、已由中中交農四行貼現付款、停付本息之說、證實不確、於是國債買氣頗濃、價均堅漲、昨日上下午統一各債暗市收　行市、甲種上午六〇元一五、下午六〇元五〇、乙種上午五一元八〇、下午五二元三〇、丙種上午叫九元八〇、下午五〇元三五、丁種上午四八元二〇、下午四八元九五、戊種上午五〇元一〇、下午五〇元八〇、</p>
<p>阜寗等處包裹恢復</p>
<p>郵局包裹通知、江蘇區阜寗·佃湖·北沙·羊寨鎭·溝墩鎭及喩口鎮等處各項個人零星包裹及藥品包裹、現可恢復收寄、</p>
<h3>英法駐軍無撤退說　上海局勢不變　歐亞交通或須稍受影響　但對外貿易不致告中斷</h3>
<p>昨據法方某要人稱、歐局將有得要轉捩、至內容因關軍事秘密、當局自難發表、現法方四宿將貝當·魏剛·甘茂林·季陸均參與戎機、一周後局勢當可展開、至本埠局勢、並無變化、駐滬英法軍並無撤退一部份之擬議、法商輪船、現仍照常通過地中海如無特別變動、無變更航程之必要、英輪現繞道好望角、歐亞間之聯絡、自不免稍受影響、但決不若一般想像之甚、因自遠東至英國、經地中海所語之時日、爲三十日、繞道好望角、不過三十八日而已、</p>
<p>滬上陰霾　逐漸淸除</p>
<p>據英國外交界某氏談、最近滬上空氣緊張、顯爲受歐戰擴大之影響、但並不能因此即認爲在滬各國當局關係之惡化之表徵、在歐戰擴大之初、各關係國當局對上海之局勢、是否將有所變化之問題、頗多顧慮、惟自表亞洲艦隊司令赫德上將邀請各國駐華防軍司令會談、並訂立某種協定以後、本市局勢惡化之陰霾、已逐漸淸除、上海之前途、當可保持現狀、</p>
<p>中荷貿易　並未間斷</p>
<p>據荷蘭駐滬領事館發言人稱、荷蘭在此次歐戰中、橫遭侵略、以德軍集中全力、動用大批機械化部隊、並有飛機數千架、協定猛攻、荷蘭地狹人稠、爲保全數千萬生靈、免　塗炭起見、荷總司令乃沉痛下令停戰、然此非完全屈服之謂、仍有大批荷軍、在法境與協約軍駢肩作戰、以爭取最後勝利、收復失地、重獲和平與自山、荷僑在滬的有三百餘人、均從事經營商業、荷僑之在中國內地者、僅有二三人、中荷關係、素極融睦、貿易亦甚發達、現荷輪歐洲航綫、旣吿停駛、荷蘭本國貨物、亦不能來滬、惟荷屬東印度航綫、照常維持、以是雙方貿易、並未間斷、</p>
<p>滬歐電報　多如雪片</p>
<p>自歐戰擴大後、各無綫電公司、甚爲忙碌、査上海現營無綫電報業者、計有英商大東電報公司、丹麥商大北電報公司、美商太平洋商業電報公司、及前由交通部管理而現爲日方覇佔之國際無錢電台等、各公司每日收發電報、的八十件內外、柏林發來電報、的三十餘件、其發往羅馬及柏林者、亦的四十件與三十件內外、視前竟增五六倍、由此足徵上海對歐無綫電報之忙碌、至於對美無綫電報、則多以舊金山爲對象、各公司每日發出者、合計由一百五十件至二百件、收到者的七八十件之多、</p>

<h3>林語堂到港小休　擇地從事著述　林謂抗戰時期應其犧牲精神　美人認日本已絕無成功希望</h3>
<p>名作家林語堂由美返國、於本月十日抵港後、即寓居九龍、旋以患風痛症，謝絕酬酢、　居休養、香港中國文化協進會。中國文藝協會。及中英文化協會等團體、原擬開會歡迎林氏，且以推定籌備人員、並山香港大學敎授許地山代表往晤林氏、轉達各文化團體準備歡迎之　、林氏當即尤諾、但翌晨忽父通知許氏，謂不收勞各團歡迎、以極謙虛之態度而婉加謝絕、</p>
<p>林氏族人　熱烈歡迎</p>
<p>語堂此次返國抵港、極受國人歡迎、而尤以林氏、示族更表熱烈、認林氏蜚聲國際、爲國宣勞、實足光宗耀　、故香港林西河堂宋親會、亦準備開會歡迎，當時並推定代　林賜明·林耀寰·等負責籌　、但結果因未獲與林氏謀面，遂未能如期舉行、</p>
<p>報人約晤　歡敘一堂</p>
<p>本月十四日香港各報記者、特約林氏在威士文餐室晤談、林氏準時蒞臨、就座後、首謂與各位談話、勿拘形式、隨便交換意見、各記者即詢以今後對著述事業之計劃、美國方面劉中日戰事之一般輿論及美日兩國對荷印態度等問題、林氏即對以上所詢各問題、作詳盡解答、至於說明其個人將來專心著述、無　仕途、語極幽默、茲將林氏談話分誌如下、</p>
<p>赴渝游歷　無意任進</p>
<p>林氏將於一兩週內前往軍慶、轉赴各地遊歷、以　察抗戰時期國內一般情狀、以後再擇交通利便之處、作久居之計、繼續著述工作、據謂此爲文人本色、本人固無意進入政治舞台」、林氏認做官應具獨特之才能、與文人完全不同、如白居易·蘇東坡·袁子才·等、雖均曾入宦途、終至掛掛冠而去、惟亦有旣能寫作、又能幹事者、如曾國藩即是、有詢以今後著述計劃如何、據答、尙無決定討論政治之大文章、當於可能範圍內、繼續寫作、林君並加詳細說明、在抗戰時期、國人應爲國家前途、犧牲個人之自由、統制輿論、本人認爲實屬必要、各國在戰時亦均有實行、惟問題在於如何實施、如北洋軍閥時代、吳稚暉先生曾著文痛斥曹錕之寵僕李彥靑、竟被加以侮辱中華民國之罪名、此實屬笑話之尤、</p>
<p>美對中國　極爲樂觀</p>
<p>繼談及美國對中日戰事之與論、據謂、當前年廣州·漢口　繼淪陷後、美國興論到中國　途、極爲焦慮、美著名評論家李潑門（WaiterLippman）其評論供給百餘　報紙、　具有相當潛勢力、渠曾作此論調、惟渠係專門　究　洲問題者、木人認其對遠東情形、未免隔膜、故作此結論、其後一年間、日在華軍事、毫無進展、而自東京各外國通訊社所發出消息、日本不斷發生米荒·煤荒·電氣荒·人工荒·等風潮、認爲日本國力已瀕竭蹶、而對去年日本議會風潮、即齋藤隆夫失言事件、尢爲重視、認齋藤所提出之質問、爲日本人民所急欲明瞭者、而渠竟敢率直提出、則人民不滿政府、反對戰事、其情緒如何激昂、可以想見、其後日侵賓陽、又以不願擴延戰綫爲飾詞、而自　後退一點、美國一般輿論、認爲日本侵略力量、已到極點、另一方面、鑒於中國之繼續堅決抗戰、而由內地觀察歸來者又均贊譽中國之進步、於是美國輿論、由焦慮而　爲樂觀、近二三月來、則均認日本已絕無成功希望矣、</p>
<p>對僞組織　大肆譏評</p>
<p>「南京組織」之成立、美國人士、均不重視、此在日方雖不斷宣傳、已達一年之久、短見者或爲所愚、認係代表中國之「主和派」、俱在有知識及有思想者、則平認爲毫無價値、其次美各報評論作者聚會、本人亦參加、當談及僞組織　、彼等述各僞組織之關係、及其內情、甚爲群細、木人尙愧不如、美報對僞組織論調、頗爲刻薄、林氏解釋美人對華同情、　因日本此次侵華、是非甚明、不若九一八時本人在英國、當時一般人爲日方宣傳　蔽、認爲日本在東三省之投資、旣遭侵害、致用武力攫取、尙有可原也</p>
<p>日對荷印　不敢輕動</p>
<p>日對荷印態度、據林氏意見、其關鍵在美、如美表示其堅決之態度、則日必不敢輕舉妄動、或詢日如竟不顧、一切、侵佔荷印、則美將如何、據預測美對日經濟制裁、必更嚴厲施行、以促日覺悟、如在二三年內、局勢不能改善、則太平洋人戰、　至爆發、</p>
<p>美人崇拜　中國哲理</p>
<p>最後談及渠本人在美之著作、及關於出版等問題、擴請再美所著各書、以「生活得藝術」銷行最佳、除上述各書外、有「中國新聞及輿論史」一冊、大都係介紹中國學術思想及生活哲學等、使外人對中國可史有深切了解、最近美國風行之「孔子曰」運動、係爲投合美人之好奇心理、如無綫電播音·報紙廣吿、均以「孔子曰」爲號召、市上發售小册子、封面題爲「孔子曰」、但考其內容、則多美國俚語、或竟爲低級趣味之文字、但一般美人對中國哲理、極爲崇拜、更有以中國老年人象　深知世故、透澈人生哲學者、談話至四時半始散、林氏御灰色綢長衫、狀至瀟洒、而談話時、態度亦至懇切、口啣烟斗、未稍離手、林氏在「生活的藝術」一文中、頗贊烟之能助淸談、今林氏長談一小時有半、此亦烟之所賜歟、</p>
<h3>禮和洋行　被控遠背商約　歐局緊張客貨不能到滬　被告提出證件認非遠約　案須審閱證件改期再奪</h3>

<h3>你往那裏去　（三）</h3>
<p>有一天，我在河邊散步，那時正值洪水徒漲，急流成漩渦，在數滿的中間，有許多的柴草，跟着水漩轉，牠們沒有目的地，故永遠到不着什麼地方，世上像這樣的人甚多，他們勞碌不息，問他們往那裏去，他們惟一的答覆是，沒有什麼地方去。他們的至情，被他們無力控制的勢力攪擾着，驅使着，永不得安息。人生之流，向前冲撃，把他們簽在漩渦中，盲目的漩轉着，他們的生命，因而　成苦役之一環，得不着出路。這是很可悲的。第二次我又在河邊散步，見有許多的大木材，隨水流下，若是水急而淺，木材便常在石上摩擦，若水深而緩，木材便很平靜的向前進。我因此便想到；一個人跟着大衆同流合汚是容易的，人家怎樣，我也怎樣。這可說得是　乎時代，却不能說超越時代。羣衆的旨趣，總是向下的。第三次在河邊散　步，所見的情形與前二次都不同，且更能令人興奮。情形是這樣：河內有許多的帆船，因水流得過急，都靠岸拋錨，午後兩旬鐘，天上起了風，風勢雖不上分順，船主們却張着帆，斜借風勢，來一個牛誰行舟，把貨物都運到上流目的地去。他們不隨水飄蕩，不以風轉變其人生之路。他們的志行堅直，值得我們佩服。「你往那裏去？」願諸君向上水行，負起人生重担，往立下的目標努力！效法船主們，借着逆風以求進步。這條路是狹窄難行的，但是確實可靠。（待續）</p>

<h3>戰事擴大聲中歐洲三都文化　號稱世界文化中心的巴黎　（上）</h3>
<p>— 史弢</p>
<p>法蘭西向來以世界的文化中心和藝術的祖國自任，這世界的文化中心在戰時可變成怎樣了呢？要談這件事，那麼先該別忘記她如今已將六百萬男子送在戰場之上，擁有社會活動能力的男子，已全部被動員了。法蘭西全體國民的總力，此刻正集中在唯一最高的目的—國防之上。因此，今日法國的文化生活——也就是法國人文化方面的　向，是絕對不能離去「非打勝仗不可」這一個國民的總意志的。</p>
<p>學術界總動員</p>
<p>一切學問都為了實行戰爭而動員着，法國早在戰爭之前，準備着學術總動員體制了。有優秀才能的人，都各各使他們服務於適當的地方，這個知的總動員在今日之法國已獲得相當的成績。所有的學着現在都直接或間接地參加那科學陣營，醫生和藥劑師們穿了軍裝，依照政府的命令而活動着。專門技術者，有的被派在軍需工塲裏，有的負着紅濟指導的重任，就是那些自由的文人，也是在同一的狀態之中。例如作家強其羅德氏，被任為情報部中一個重要的部長，他現在正招集了文壇上的故舊和新聞記者，應付檢閱國內外情報和宣傳的任務。又像前駐日大使比拉氏，現在當了情報部的遠東部長，他動員了多數法國的遠東專家，來處理遠東方面的宣傳和檢閱情報等事務。</p>
<p>恬靜的藝術家</p>
<p>從戰爭開始到現在，法國文藝界沒有任何可以注目的動態，也沒一本傑出的著作。前次世界大戰的戰爭文學，是在戰後數年後才出現的，那末在戰事開始未久的現在當然法國是不會突然產生新文學的。沙龍美展像歷年一般舉行着，但幾乎全是戰前的作品，唯有達拉第前首相肖像和若干戰場上的畫家所作的前綫風景素描，倒是這次大會中惹人注目的一二異彩。又因為油畫用具非常缺乏的緣故，美術展覽會中的出品，盡是一些小型的畫件，要之，如今法國的哲學家，文學家，藝術家，技術家等，都被保護在馬奇諾防綫的裏面，沒有被砲聲騷擾的憂慮，他們或是沈湎在恬靜的思索中，或是埋首作實用藝術及其他的研究。</p>
<p>空襲下讀書熱</p>
<p>戰時的國民教養問題，是動輒易陷枯渴之境的。戰爭勃發之初，在藏書的質量上，稱為世界之寶的法　國立圖書館，以及巴黎各區的市立圖書館等，都全部停止開放。到了今年，鑒於戰事的膠着，便一個個又開放了。因此巴黎市民在戰時仍能夠滿足他們讀書的慾望。然而巴黎依然處於不斷的空襲威脅之中，所以不得不將借出書籍數目加以限制。當空襲警報一響，每個人就挾着書本，逃到地下室去。在這種緊張的空氣中。我們還很容易看見每個淸晨，便有許多羣衆排成長列等候那圖書館的開放。巴黎市民的讀書熱，於此當可想像了。</p>

<h3>蛾</h3>
<p>— 悲悸</p>
<p>一隻燈娥從黝黑的窗外飛進來，飛着，漸逼近了一盞黃昏的油燈。跳動的火頭和閃耀的光亮——是一個光明的誘惑呵—這小小而勇敢的昆虫向着火源不絕廻旋，進撲…。</p>
<p>我的心靈被一個新的意識所推動了，這小小的虫豸不是從黑暗潮濕的角落跑來的嗎？</p>
<p>我驟然聞到一種烤枯的臭味，一縷輕煙結束了這小小勇士光明的企求。</p>
<p>我被感動得流淚了，我祈禱，我並且發誓，我現在該是脫離地獄的時候了。</p>

<h3>向羅斯福請願的小姑娘</h3>
<p>— 溫和</p>
<p>這是去年耶誕　左右的事。</p>
<p>桑德拉葛蘭德是一個美國小姑娘，住在紐傑寶州的紐華克，留着厚厚的金色髮辮。在耶誕節之前，她費了一個下半天的功夫，寫了許多張的賀年卡片，寫好後，她當然要去寄了。可是她的爹爹媽媽不答應。因為頂近他們家裏的郵箱，也得穿過三條熱鬧的馬路才走得到。小孩于一個人去闖馬路當然爹爹媽媽不放心，但是爹爹媽媽也沒功夫陪她去。葛蘭德　裏不快樂了。</p>
<p>爹爹有些硬心腸，他說：『你要想自已去寄信，你應該去請求羅斯福總統。』</p>
<p>爹爹是同她說着玩的，可是她等耶誕節過掉以後，自己居然寫了一封信給維總統，信裏這樣說：</p>
<p>『親愛的總統先生——我知道你和郵政總長是好朋友，我現在請求你替我做一件事，請你同他講一聲：在我的馬路上裝一隻郵政信箱。因為我現在去寄信，一定要走很遠的路，路上是很危險的。假如他肯聽你的話，我很高興從這隻信　裏再寫封信來謝謝你。</p>
<p>桑德拉葛蘭德啟</p>
<p>再啟：我今年只有七歲』</p>
<p>信寄去後，不知道羅斯福有沒有讀到。但是在一個民主國家，任何人民的合理的請求政府都應當考慮的。所以雖然年齡還只七歲的葛蘭德，她的請求竟然也發生效力了。</p>
<p>葛蘭德家的對門電報柱子上，果然有人來裝了一隻簇新的郵政信箱！雖然這隻信箱裝得太高一些，而且還得要穿過馬路才走得到，葛蘭德的媽媽因為心裏高興，這一次終究讓葛蘭德自己去寄信了。媽媽替她留心着汽車，她自己帶了一隻空木箱，跑了過去。雙足站在木箱上面，她得意地寄出了給羅斯福總統的第二封信。</p>

<h3>可敬愛的孩子</h3>
<p>— 莫梓</p>
<p>每天下午，都有許多來讀短期難童班的孩子，聚集在學校門口，等待四點鐘過後，其他正班的學生散課了，纔一擁而入地跑進敎室，來受他們難得的兩小時的敎育得的兩小時的敎育。</p>
<p>他們的衣衫雖然很舊褸，也沒有精美的書包盛着書籍，不過用二隻烏黑的小手，捧着幾冊薄薄的書本罷了。然而看了他們那付虔敬的神情，一心一意地靜待着「知識之門」的開放，那默默的眸子裏，是包含着多麼深切的渴望啊！每大我默默地望着他們，望着他們瘦小的然而可愛的面龐，雖然和他們嗎很生疏，但我的心却在感激地跳動着，我的神經也被感動得火熱了。從他們的身上，我看見新中國成長的影子，不由得默頌着：可敬愛的孩子！</p>
<p>但是，看到他們鵠立在牆籬的外面，張望着裏面操塲上孩子們快樂的遊戲，並且還時時露出緊張的表情，關心着裏面那一方一球的得失，有時也跟着手舞足蹈起來，我的心又不禁感到輕輕的悵惘了。在操塲上玩着皮球，滾着鐵環的孩子是快樂的，然而操塲外面的孩子們臉上的喜悅，却表示皮球也在他們心上蹤跳，鐵環也在他們心上滾着啊。起先我想到人槪他們剛從小工廠裏出來，或者剛剛幫助他們的母親糊好一些小工藝，此刻竟能這樣地快樂，畢竟是無知的孩子啊。但後來我却深深地譴責自己了。孩子的一份天眞和活潑，正是他們生命的泉源。即使在萬分苦艱中，這一顆熱烈可愛的心，也是非常應該尊重的啊。我眞想對他們懇切地說：孩子們！就在這很短的時間裏，忘掉你們的苦難吧，保持這一顆純潔熱烈的心，你們將要從苦難中生長起來！</p>

<h3>評好萊塢導演的作風</h3>
<p>— 先德</p>
<p>紐約泰晤士報的影評記者曾經說過：一張影片的成功與失敗，導演先生要負一分之二的責任，共餘一分之一才是演員或　他的責任。一的確，徒　有好劇本，好演員，而無好導演，那會使整個影片陷入惡劣的結果。相反地，平常的劇本，普通的演員，祇要經　導演的處理得法，也能獲到成功。因此我們對於導演，更有注意之必要了。</p>
<p>下面的十二位導演，都是好萊塢有名導演之一部分，就我個人私見，作簡單的評述於後：</p>
<p>（一）的翰斯泰爾　（JohnM．Stah），在目前他是「最好六導演之一，同時也是薪金最高的導演，作風精湛細膩，以導演家庭問題見長。「何日君再來」可爲其代表作。</p>
<p>（二）西席地密爾（Cecilr．Demille），他的特點是，偉大，細膩，迅速，處理大塲面緊張有力。代表作爲「鐵馬」</p>
<p>（三）馬格爾寇蒂斯，他擅長處理歷史片及四千金」型的片子。有口皆碑的「羅賓漢」及「四千金」爲具代表作。</p>
<p>（四）劉別謙，他以處理喜劇見長，作品小少。「琦呢珈娜」爲其代表作。</p>
<p>（五）威廉蒂勒（William　Dieterle）是一個有正義一感的導演，他以導演歷史傳奇片專長，其作品都員有反獨裁，正義感，　情於被壓迫民族。代表作爲腥風　雨」及「錦繡山河」。</p>
<p>（六）　廉凱棄（WilliamKeighley），來塢人叫他做「G—man　Keighley」，山此可知他適合於導演　G—man的片子了，作風是簡潔』無「拖泥帶水」之弊。賈克奈諸片多爲他導演。</p>
<p>（七）希區考克（Hitchcock），作風雄偉，處理神秘恐怖性影片頗有心得。</p>
<p>（八）歐文肯明斯（IrvingCummings），作風輕鬆流利，歌舞片頗佳。代表作爲流「銀國春秋」。</p>
<p>（九）霍華霍克斯（Howard　Hawks）的　點爲動作多於對白，因此對於不懂央語的人頗有好感。「鐵血主義」可爲代表。</p>
<p>（十）約翰福特（John　Ford），作風以雄闊見長，代表作爲「革命叛徒」。曾獲科學院最佳導演獎。</p>
<p>（十）（一）亨利考斯說（Henry　Koster）之作品，輕鬆流利，細膩熨貼。狄娜　萍所演除「小鳥依人外諸片，均爲渠所導演。</p>
<p>（十）（二）丁偉倫（The　Whelam），他對於喜劇頗有心得，代表作爲「浪漫夫人」。</p>
<h3>劇藝社得戲據獎金　——二十二日舉行國際公演</h3>
<p>英法大使夫入主持之國際慈善公演，已決定請上海劇藝社演出「武則天」在半月之前，曾作預演二塲，英法使館派人來看，認爲滿意，於是定二十二晚正式舉行。票價每張十元，已由英法使館推銷一空，上海劇藝社重視這次國際性的演出，所以把所有最優秀的演員，都排在一個戲里，那天晚上並且有一個隆重的節目，同時舉行，在外國戲劇獎金，文藝獎金或電影獎余是常有的事。可是在中國確還沒有。中法聯誼會戲劇組爲了鼓勵上海劇藝社一年來的工作，將於二十二日晚發給上海劇藝社獎金一千元，並且有五個榮譽的獎狀給最優秀的演員，擔任　給的是英法大使夫人，像這樣隆重的節目，在沉悶的劇壇上還是第一次呢。</p>
<h3>假戲真做</h3>
<p>— 籌成</p>
<p>本市花　　同業公會主席洪頌炯君，多才多藝除擅丹靑，精岐黃術外，又能如游藝家人人笑之能作鷄鳴犬吠等口技。此次上海救濟難民兒童敎養院，舉辦之濟善游藝　，渠係該院院醫，故擔任招待，甚爲忙碌。第五日因各種游藝時刻，尙不敷半句鐘，渠觸景生情，即利用口技，演獨幕劇「難民淚」。臨時化裝難婦，另有該院　童，充難婦之子，因夫被炸死，外出求乞，宿於田野，夜　狺狺犬吠，荒凉極矣黎明雄鷄　曉，而飛機又來。婦本懷孕，挈兒逃避，驚慌之　忽然生產，飢寒交迫，一無所有，母子二人抱孩向人求乞，歷述遇難情形時，此難童感切身之痛　眞哭，涕淚交流，慘不忍覩。觀衆甚爲感動。甚有隨之哭不成聲者。洪君所作之犬吠鷄鳴，與小孩哭泣聲，飛機環繞聲，以及在中放　關槍聲，與炸彈墮地之轟炸聲，莫不維妙　肖，宛似置身、中　假戲眞做，衆皆黯然。於是觀衆相率　鈔票角幣，向台上紛投，絡繹亂擲，會內主持人，恐秩　擾亂，即請招待　全體出動，遇有觀衆欲捐錢時，代爲轉遞，結果總其捐到國幣二百零三元七角八分。</p>

<h3>新藝改良平劇團　組織的經過</h3>
<p>— 生</p>
<p>於新藝改良平劇團與新藝社兩個團體，外間往往辨別不淸，我這裏可以一述新藝改良平劇團的大概。</p>
<p>是去年的秋大，許多平劇界靑年伶人都聚集攏來，籌備組織一個改良平劇的劇團，裹面有張翼鵬，張二鵬，金素雯，李順來，李瑞來，李文濬，何毓如，梁次山等和其他許多人，曾經開過幾次會議，並且塡了志願書，雖然沒有正式成　，「新藝」的名　却在那時由這一輩同志們決定的。後來纔產生新藝社，分詁劇和平劇兩組，曾向工部局　案，平劇組方面是李順來，李文濬，梁次山，何毓如叫位，但結果都沒有成立。</p>
<p>最近，李順來他們覺得非實現志願不可，就由新藝的基小團員組織起來，再加入于素蓮　幾位，就成立現在到寗波去的「新藝改良平劇團」，所以　團的中堅份十，仇就是新藝社平劇組的基本組員，他們打起「新藝」的旗號，是有這一番淵源的。</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Important Key to the European War</h3>
<p>Germany launched the Western Front war, invading the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg on a large scale. It has only been a week so far, but within a few days, it has taken Luxembourg and the Netherlands and joined forces with Britain and France between France and Belgium. Germany's speed of using troops is indeed undeniable.</p>
<p>Germany's success in this decision-making battle of Holland and Belgium is the same as in the last decisive battle; it adopted an active offensive, while the Allied powers took a defensive position. Tactically, Germany took the lead. Germany invaded the Netherlands with a large army, directly approaching Rotterdam, cutting the Netherlands in two; another army advanced from Liège to Brussels, the capital of Belgium, and then captured Brussels and advanced towards the French border; the left wing broke through Sedan on the Maginot Line to contain the Allied forces; Its main force is still on the right wing. If Germany concentrates its forces on the right wing to attack the Allied forces, and the Allied forces also concentrate their forces to defend tit-for-tat, then the situation in this decisive battle will be the same as in the last decisive battle, becoming a "competition of wings". The expansion of the German right wing must stop at the westernmost Belgian coast. According to a news report from the German Sea Communication Agency, "German troops have approached a certain important French-Belgian artillery position on the opposite shore of Dover in the English Channel. This advance is exactly the same as in 1914," etc. This explanation is of course the truth.</p>
<p>From Germany's launch of the invasion of Holland, Belgium, and Luxembourg to the present, it has been unstoppable. The Allied forces have not been able to curb its edge, and London and Paris have been shocked by it. Recalling the last European war, there was also a similar stage; until the German army approached Paris, it was only after the Battle of the Marne that it was frustrated. Then, when and where will the Allied forces in this decision-making battle stop the German offensive? This is what the world is concerned about! However, history never repeats itself mechanically; this decision-making war is very different from previous years. Analyzing its major points, in the last decision-making Germany had to deal with two-sided operations, with Britain and France in the west and Imperial Russia in the east; in this decision-making Germany only has one-sided operations, and there is no Soviet Union to contain it in the east. This can prevent it from repeating the mistakes of the last decision-making and concentrate its forces to implement its combat plans. At the beginning of the last World War, Germany had 100 divisions on the Western Front, while Britain and France only had 72 divisions. In terms of military strength, they had an absolute advantage; after the Eastern Front became urgent, up to 20 divisions were transferred away. Therefore, Germany had only 80 divisions on the Western Front, while the Allied forces, as a result of successive increases, had reached 95 divisions on the eve of the Battle of the Marne, gradually surpassing Germany; therefore, the First Army under the command of the German Kluck, originally pursued the British army southwest from Mons and headed for Paris, suddenly changed its plan and proceeded to the southeast, and its right wing became the target of attack by the British and French forces; in addition, the German army was exhausted due to the long march; later, because the German transportation line, from its base to France, was 200 miles long, difficulties arose in transportation, all of which gave French General Joffre the opportunity to win the Battle of the Marne. Germany learned from the lessons of the last decision-making failure, and in terms of military strength, it is certain that this time it will be more sufficient. And in the past 20 years. The progress of military science is rapid, and the air force has become an important force in this decision-making war, which is enough to promote changes in the war situation. Therefore, in this decision-making war, the Allied forces attempted to frustrate the sharp momentum of the German offensive and form a stalemate trench warfare. The degree of difficulty is probably greater than in the last European war.</p>
<p>French Commander-in-Chief General Gamelin said in his speech encouraging the soldiers of the country, "The war has already begun. This war is related to the fate of our country, all allied countries and the entire world. … If our soldiers cannot move forward, they must not shrink from death in battle. We can only abide by one motto: that is, to die if we do not win." This is the same as the sentence in General Joffre's order on the Marne front in September 1914. Joffre said, "At the moment when the war, which is related to the safety of the country, is about to begin, I feel that I must urge you to pay attention to the fact that now is not the time to retreat. All forces must be concentrated on a counterattack to drive away the enemy. Troops that cannot advance must maintain the acquired position at all costs, and would rather maintain the position and die than retreat and live." Although the majority of the German army is still within the territory of Belgium and has not yet penetrated into France, it can be seen from General Gamelin's speech that France is already prepared to spare no effort to fight in order to frustrate the sharp momentum of the German army. News came from Paris that "the German tank corps failed in its attempt to advance towards Paris and was completely restricted and retreated nine miles due to the sharp counterattack of the French." This is of course not sufficient evidence that the sharp momentum of Germany has been exhausted, nor is it sufficient to regard it as the prelude to the victory of Britain and France, but the transition from the irresistible force of the German army to a stalemate between the two sides cannot but regard these nine miles as an important symbol. As for the final victory, it is still far away in time.</p>
<h3>Air Battle in Liangshan, Eastern Sichuan: Seven Japanese Aircraft Shot Down; The Location of Four Crashes Have Been Identified; The Remains of the Other Three Are Being Investigated</h3>
<p>Chongqing: In the air battle in Liangshan, six Japanese aircraft were shot down by the Chinese army. A heavy bomber has now been found in an area 20 li north of Liangshan. The aircraft was destroyed and the personnel were killed. The serial number was burned. A total of seven aircraft have been shot down before and after.

<p>Chongqing: 24 Japanese heavy bombers invaded Sichuan Province from western Hubei on the 20th. They infiltrated the northwestern area of Liangshan at 7 AM and had the appearance of attacking Liangshan. A certain Chinese fighter plane had already detected it and took off to attack. It immediately formed a siege formation over Liangshan. At 7:45 AM, the Japanese aircraft risked flying over Liangshan. Seeing that the Japanese had fallen into the trap, the Chinese air force launched a thunderous posture and heavily surrounded the Japanese aircraft. The Japanese aircraft initially attempted to resist stubbornly, but were severely threatened by the Chinese high-altitude forces. The formation collapsed, and they struggled to break through. The Chinese heroes responsible for frontal interception gave the Japanese a head-on blow. The Japanese were timid and sought to escape and were strongly controlled by the Chinese pursuit force. Within effective range, they concentrated fire on several Japanese aircraft with maximum firepower. The Japanese aircraft somersaulted up and down, trying to escape. In an instant, two Japanese heavy bombers were hit by machine guns, exploded, and crashed. At this time, the Chinese air force's attack became more fierce. The Japanese could not break through and counterattacked the Chinese army. The Chinese high-altitude brave forces seized the opportunity of the Japanese chaos and controlled the three Japanese aircraft, aiming at the fuel tanks. The Japanese aircraft were all burned, and the tails fell, like withered red leaves. While the fierce battle was in progress, the remaining Japanese aircraft suddenly flew east. The Chinese army pursued bravely. One Japanese aircraft was shot down by the Chinese army halfway. The remaining Japanese aircraft fled to Wanxian County. An intense air battle came to an end. The Chinese army returned triumphantly. In total, the Chinese shot down six Japanese bombers in this battle. The location of the crash has been identified for three aircraft. One crashed in the eastern part of Zhongxian County. The fuselage was damaged, and the Japanese combatants were killed. Its serial number is 4528. One crashed at the foot of the Fenshuiling Mountain. The fuselage was burned, and the Japanese combatants parachuted and escaped. A search is underway. One crashed 20 li west of Kaixian County. Most of the Japanese aircraft was burned, and the Japanese combatants were killed. The last two digits of its serial number are 79. The other three crashed between Zhongxian County and Kaixian County. The Chinese are sending personnel to investigate. (20th)</p>

Residents of Chongqing took refuge in air-raid shelters for six hours. Chengdu issued the first alert at 7:30 PM, and an emergency alert one hour later. The first batch of Japanese aircraft appeared in the sky at 8:35 PM. They apparently did not drop bombs, or they were very far from Chengdu. Twenty minutes later, the second batch of Japanese aircraft dropped flares and then dropped bombs near the southern suburbs. Twenty-five minutes later, the third batch of Japanese aircraft arrived and dropped several bombs near the southern suburbs again. The extent of the damage is currently unknown.

<h3>Central United Weekly: He Yingqin's Report: The Japanese Invade Xiang in Five Routes</h3>
<p>Chongqing: General He Yingqin, in his speech at the Central Executive Committee this morning, declared, "Only when China's territorial integrity is preserved and the Japanese army is completely expelled from Chinese territory can the final goal of the War of Resistance be said to be realized. All Chinese people must be of one heart and one mind, continue their efforts, and engage in resistance." (Reuter's, 20th)</p>
<p>Chongqing: At the Central Party Headquarters' National Government United Memorial Weekly Report on the Henan-Hubei Campaign on the 20th, He Yingqin stated that since the Japanese had continuously attacked the southern Henan and northern Hubei areas, Wuhan had been under constant threat. To ensure the safety of Wuhan and reduce the threat, the Japanese, in April of this year, drew troops from northern Jiangxi and northern Hunan, and concentrated troops within Hubei Province, aiming at Nanyang and Xiangfan, adopting a strategy of converging attacks to annihilate the Chinese army south of Nanyang and east of the Xiang River. Their invading forces totaled seven divisions, concentrated in the three areas of Xinyang, Suixian, and Zhongxiang, with a focus on the right flank (i.e., the Xinyang area). They began their offensive against China on May 1st. The Japanese forces from Xinyang and Suixian each advanced in two routes. The Japanese advance took on five routes: (1) From Shizhangtaiguan via Minggang, turning towards Biyang and Tanghe; (2) From Xinyang to Tongbai; (3) From Suixian to Zaoyang; (4) From Suixian to Wujiadian; (5) From Zhongxiang to Shuanggou. The Chinese forces, except for those resisting on the Suizao Road in the central area, gradually retreated to the Tanghe River basin while simultaneously defending Tongbai Mountain and Dahong Mountain. The main forces moved towards the left and right flanks of the Japanese to seize the initiative on the outer lines. The Japanese advanced blindly, and on the right flank, they occupied Minggang on May 1st, Biyang on the 6th, and Tanghe on the 8th. The central forces also broke through to Zaoyang on the 8th. On the left flank, they occupied Zhangjiaji on the 7th and continued to advance towards Xinye. By the 10th, the Japanese encirclement was complete, and the invading forces from all routes converged on the east side of the Xiang River and the banks of the Tangbai River. However, the encirclement failed, and the original plan was completely shattered. The Chinese outer flank forces instead pressed the Japanese left and right flanks towards the central area, encircling the majority of the Japanese forces in the plains east of the Xiang River. By the 10th, the Chinese encirclement was complete. They then retook Tanghe and Biyang, firmly encircling four Japanese divisions near Zaoyang and launching a fierce assault to annihilate them. Furthermore, a strong force advanced along the Hanyi Road, deep into the vicinity of Jingshan, Zaoshi, Yingcheng, and Anlu, attacking the Japanese rear and threatening Hankou. At the same time, another force occupied the strongholds of Wusheng Pass on the Pinghan Railway, cutting off the communication lines of the Japanese forces on all routes, making it impossible for the Japanese in Hankou to provide reinforcements. On the 14th, the Chinese forces also retook Changtaiguan, advanced towards Xinyang, and occupied the northwestern strongholds of the suburbs. On the afternoon of the 18th, they occupied Yangshan Station, stormed into Xinyang City, and engaged in fierce street fighting. Another force stormed into the airfield, killing hundreds of Japanese guards and destroying twelve Japanese aircraft. Currently, the railway between Xinyang and Wusheng Pass, as well as the Pingjing Pass on the Yingxin Highway, are completely cut off by the Chinese army. The Japanese forces encircled near Zaoyang have suffered heavy casualties, with Japanese corpses littering the field. By the afternoon of the 16th, the Chinese forces had retaken Zaoyang, and the Japanese retreated in disarray towards the southeast, still stubbornly resisting in the areas of Tangxian Town, Xinglongji, and Wujiadian south of Zaoyang a month ago. According to telegram confirmations, the actual number of Japanese killed in this campaign is 45,000, with over 60 artillery pieces, 2,000 horses, over 70 tanks, and over 400 vehicles captured. Other spoils of war are being inventoried. (20th dispatch)</p>
<h3>General Wei Gang Transferred to Allied Forces Commander-in-Chief, Also Chief of General Staff of French Defense Forces</h3>
<p>Paris: Premier Reynaud met this afternoon with Cabinet Counselor and Minister without Portfolio General Pétain, as well as General Weygand, Commander-in-Chief of the Near East Forces, for an hour-long discussion. Afterwards, President Lebrun issued an order appointing General Weygand as Chief of the General Staff of the National Defense Forces and Commander-in-Chief of the Frontline Armies. (Havas, 19th)</p>
<p>Paris: General Weygand, the newly appointed Chief of the General Staff of the National Defense Forces and Commander-in-Chief of the Frontline Armies, is a renowned general of the present era. He was born in the capital of Belgium on January 22, 1867. At the outbreak of the European War in 1914, as a lieutenant colonel of the 5th Cavalry Regiment, he led his troops into battle. On August 28th of that year, he was appointed Chief of Staff by General Foch, commander of the 9th Army Corps. From then on, he followed General Foch until the end of the European War. On October 1, 1915, he was promoted to Chief of Staff of the Northern Army. He inflicted a major defeat on the enemy in the Battle of the Yser River. On March 26, 1918, he was promoted to Quartermaster General of the Allied Forces. After the signing of the Treaty of Versailles, he served as Secretary General of the Allied Military Commission. In 1920, he went to Warsaw to plan the repulsion of Soviet troops for the Polish army. He then served as Commander-in-Chief of the French Near East Forces. In 1924, he became a member of the Supreme Military Council and also served as Chief of Staff of the Army and Inspector General of the Army. When the European War broke out again last September, he was reappointed as Commander-in-Chief of the Near East Forces. Due to the urgency of the Western Front, he has now been transferred to his current position. (Havas, 19th)</p>
<p>Paris: General Weygand was appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Allied Forces last night, succeeding General Gamelin. General Weygand is a strategist of Belgian origin. He arrived in Paris from Syria yesterday. It is widely believed that after General Weygand takes office, the Allied forces will shift from defensive warfare to offensive warfare. Military observers say that General Weygand led the Allied forces to victory in the last European War and will launch a bold strategy this time, unlike Gamelin's excessive caution. As for General Gamelin's future position, it is kept secret. General Weygand's appointment was approved by the British government and Prime Minister Churchill. This change of history was decided after a one-hour meeting yesterday between Premier Reynaud, General Pétain, and General Weygand. General Gamelin was not present. (Reuter's, 20th)</p>

<h3>Allied Forces Resisting German Offensive: Fierce Fighting Around Saint-Quentin; French Counterattack East of Cambrai; German Army Adopts Encirclement Strategy on the Left Flank</h3>
<p>Paris: According to semi-official sources, as of 11:15 a.m. today, the situation on the Northern Front is as follows: (1) The German army's left flank is launching a strategic encirclement; (2) Our army is fiercely resisting east of Cambrai, sparing no effort; (3) Although the situation of the German advance west in the Saint-Quentin area is very serious, there has been no significant change in the past 24 hours. (Havas, 20th)</p>
<p>Paris: The General Headquarters issued a battle report this morning stating that our army is fiercely resisting the enemy's attack north of Saint-Quentin. The enemy forces that crossed the Aisne River in the vicinity of Rethel were repelled by our army last night. At the same time, the enemy launched a fierce attack in the vicinity of Montmédy, but failed to succeed. In addition, our air force continued to bomb the enemy's rear positions last night to cut off their supplies. (Havas, 20th)</p>
<p>London: Responsible sources here declare that although the situation in France remains serious, there is no reason for panic. There have been no major changes in the past 24 hours. The German army has made slight progress in the northwest. According to the opinion of people here, it is difficult to analyze the accurate situation of the war. It is reported that the German and French armies are now mixed together in various places. In some areas, the German army is behind the French line, while in other areas, the French army is behind the German line. (Reuter's, 20th)</p>
<p>Paris: The General Headquarters issued a battle report stating, "Our army is resolutely resisting northeast of Saint-Quentin, and the fighting is extremely fierce. The enemy's repeated attacks near Montmédy were repelled. The enemy suffered heavy losses. The air forces of both sides are very active. Our fighters and anti-aircraft batteries shot down many enemy planes. On one occasion, a group of fifteen enemy planes was shot down nine by our army." (Havas, 19th)</p>
<p>London: The General Headquarters of the British Expeditionary Force issued a communiqué stating that yesterday the enemy launched several attacks on British positions within French territory, all of which were repelled. (Havas, 20th)</p>
<p>London: Last night, the British Headquarters declared that the British front line was able to maintain its original state under enemy pressure today (Sunday). (Reuter's, 20th)</p>
<p>German Army Emphasizes Left Flank Warfare, Encountering Fierce Resistance from Allied Forces</p>
<p>Paris: Regarding the Western Front, observers here recently stated that the German authorities clearly intend to decide the outcome with the left flank army. Their mechanized units, operating on a 50-60 kilometer front between the Sambre and Oise Rivers, consist of four or five divisions. These units are currently exerting all their efforts to advance westward. It is generally believed that this is the main objective of the German army, and the military actions on other fronts are only intended to contain or disperse French forces. However, the mechanized units have encountered fierce resistance from the Anglo-French Allied forces. In recent days, both sides have used large numbers of tanks in battle, supplemented by automatic machine gun squads and motorcycle squads. Therefore, there is no fixed front line. The reason why a few German motorcycle squads were able to advance to the vicinity of Laon some days ago and once reached Beronne last night is due to this. As for the southeast of this large-scale "tank warfare," there have only been some local actions. These are further recounted as follows: (1) Some German units attempted to seize some bridges on the Aisne River, but only two units crossed the river in certain areas within Rethel. The other units were all repelled by the French army. The two units in Rethel were all captured. (2) Montmédy is the starting point of the Maginot Line. The defense there is mainly based on giant fortresses, surrounded by medium-sized bunkers, and in front are numerous small bunkers, all equipped with automatic machine guns to protect the fortresses. When some German units attacked the defenses of the city, only one unit managed to occupy a small bunker, and the other units were repelled by the French army and suffered electrical shocks. (3) The line from Montmédy to the Swiss border is quite calm, with nothing worth mentioning. (Havas, 20th)</p>
<h3>Notre Dame Cathedral: Praying for French Victory; U.S. Ambassador Bullitt Also Attends</h3>
<p>Paris: This afternoon, a prayer service was held at Notre Dame Cathedral to pray for French victory. Premier Reynaud, Foreign Minister Daladier, other cabinet ministers, and members of the diplomatic corps, especially U.S. Ambassador Bullitt, attended the service. Archbishop of Paris, Cardinal Baudrillart, who presided over the service, declared in his sermon, "The reason we are fighting is not to gain benefits, but to fight against the evil and brutality. We firmly believe that we will achieve final victory. The consciousness of the whole world has been expressed by Pope Pius XII. We have received encouragement from this. To maintain our faith, we pray devoutly." (Havas, 19th)</p>
<p>French Tank Brigade Counterattacks Along the River, Forcing German Army to Retreat Nine Miles</p>
<p>French Army Positions: Yesterday afternoon, French tank brigades launched a fierce counterattack against the German army along the Sambre River and the Oise Canal on the Picardy Plain. After fierce fighting, they forced the German army to retreat. This retreat was the first for the German army after invading French territory. Both the German and French sides used tanks against each other yesterday. As a result of the fierce fighting, the German offensive towards Paris has been completely stopped, and the German army has been forced to retreat nine miles. It is said that the French army retook Le Cateau and Le Catelet and is holding the banks of the Oise River between Mormal Forest and Saint-Quentin. On Saturday and Sunday, the French field artillery prevented the German tank brigades from advancing. Yesterday, they were densely lined up along the Sambre River and the Oise River, wiping out two German motorized infantry detachments. The German tank brigades were forced to retreat from Le Cateau through the Oise River and Le Catelet because the motorized infantry was defeated by the French tank brigades. Yesterday, the French army launched its first counterattack against the German tank brigades with small and large tanks. The German army still used the same tactics as in the invasion of Poland, with a large number of tanks charging forward, followed by motorized infantry in a long, single-file formation. The French side believes that the only way to deal with this armored force is to use more tanks to stop it. The French army used this method to deal with the German army yesterday. When the anti-tank mines that the French army had planted on Saturday and Sunday exploded, they destroyed dozens of German tanks. However, when the second batch of German tanks continued to advance towards the French army, the French army did not have time to replant anti-tank mines to stop the German tanks from advancing. Instead, they created a steel wall with 77mm light anti-tank guns and tanks. Also, in the area of An and Somme in the Oise River basin, the German army launched the most violent attacks, but it was unable to break through the French army's iron wall. Yesterday, both the German and Allied air forces were very active in assisting the advance of the tank brigades. The sky was filled with aircraft, and the sunlight was dimmed. French tank brigades launched flanking attacks on German motorized units from time to time. The French heavy artillery also bombarded German tanks. Yesterday's tank brigade battle along the Oise River basin was unprecedented in history. French officers claimed that the French counterattack had at least stopped the advance of the German tank brigades and given the Allied forces a good opportunity to reorganize their ranks during their strategic retreat in Belgium. Allied and German troops have been fighting fiercely for a week. During this period, the troops on both sides did not get sleep or food, but the soldiers on both sides did not show signs of fatigue yesterday. This was the first time that France had stopped German armored forces from rushing from the Rhine River to the Oise River. On the front line, all rifles, machine guns, and small direct-fire cannons were unable to stop the advance of the German large tanks, followed by small tanks. During the German advance, its large tanks, numbering about 400, were deployed in formations, firing fiercely in all directions at a speed of 12 to 20 miles per hour, then charging and attacking on a large scale. The French army quickly coordinated tanks and heavy artillery to repel the German tank brigades and inflict serious damage on the German motorized infantry. Allied aircraft were continuously active yesterday, attacking German rear guard units and pontoon bridges built across the Meuse River for 17 hours. A total of 11 pontoon bridges were destroyed by heavy bombers, which had a significant impact on German rear transportation. Last night, the German positions in French territory resembled a waist shape, 30 miles deep and 50 miles wide. The front line extended from Mormal Forest through Le Catelet, Guise, Rethel, to Sedan. In theory, this battle is favorable to France, because France has better transportation lines, while the German army must pass through Belgium's narrow transportation lines, and there are no good roads behind the German front line. If the German army cannot expand from Sedan, it will not be able to use the good highway through Luxembourg, because the front line is too long. The German army's important transportation line is from Maastricht, along the Meuse River, through Liège, Namur, Dinant, to Mézières. If the fortresses of Liège and Namur remain in the hands of the Belgian army, the German transportation line will still be threatened by fierce artillery fire. The Franco-German war has reached a critical juncture. (Reuter's, 20th)</p>
<p>Allied Forces Withdraw from Northern Belgium: Important Military Installations Completely Destroyed</p>
<p>Paris: It is reported that when the Allied forces organized their withdrawal from northern Belgium, they completely destroyed all important military installations. The Dutch army on the island of Zeeland has held out for some time and has received reinforcements from the Allied forces. The Dutch army has destroyed all naval and land installations and gasoline and storage facilities in the naval dockyards of the island and the port of Flushing. Now the Dutch army has left Zeeland and is continuing to fight alongside the Allied forces. (Reuter's, 20th)</p>
<p>London: The withdrawal of the British Expeditionary Force from Belgium is now being carried out with great skill. German rumors that the British army has abandoned a large number of war supplies are false. The British army has not abandoned any war supplies. The British army has shown its agility in the past ten days, which is enough to characterize it as a well-trained army. As for its combat capability, it goes without saying. The British and Belgian troops in Belgium are now accustomed to aerial bombardment. They have taken adequate precautions and have not suffered significant losses. In short, the British army has not suffered large-scale losses. (Reuter's, 20th)</p>
<p>German Leader's Headquarters: German Army Claims: The German army is pursuing the enemy in Belgium and has reached the upper reaches of the Scheldt River. The French and Belgian troops near Mormal Forest and south of Valenciennes have been repelled by the German army, with heavy casualties. The tank units suffered particularly heavy losses. The enemy's attempt to break through to the south failed and they have now retreated to the west. In the southwest of this area, German armored columns and mechanized units have reached the Somme River. The battlefield of the European War in 1916 was here. German bombers defeated the enemy's armored units. All the forts of Liège and Namur, except for one that is still resisting stubbornly, have fallen into the hands of the German army. Yesterday, the German air force bombed transportation lines and highways in northern France and Belgium even more intensely than before, and continued to attack enemy air force bases, returning in triumph. On the coasts of France and Belgium, two enemy destroyers were sunk and another destroyer and three merchant ships were severely damaged. Yesterday, the enemy lost 143 aircraft, of which 95 were destroyed in aerial combat, 15 were shot down by anti-aircraft guns, and the rest were destroyed on the airfield by bombing. 31 German aircraft are missing. Last night, British bombers randomly dropped bombs in western Germany without any targets. Several civilians were killed or injured. The only military target was a prisoner-of-war camp, where some prisoners were killed. (Haitong Agency, 20th)</p>
<p>Berlin: Yesterday, the highest German military authorities sent a military communiqué to the Haitong Agency, which contained a very detailed account of the war situation. The communiqué stated that Antwerp is no longer a military obstacle, and the assistance of the Allied troops on the northern flank has also been cut off. In the past few days, the Belgian army and the Anglo-French Allied forces have continued to retreat and transfer to new positions. In recent days, although the events have been extensive, the German losses have been less than before, while the Allied losses have been greater than before, because the German army is gradually penetrating the enemy and using air force to bomb fiercely. And now the southern flank at Laon and near Le Chesne is waging a bloody battle. The eastern German army continues to attack the French positions. On the Maginot Line, the German army occupied the fort near Montmédy, which is one of the strongest forts on the Maginot Line. The German army used tank units to attack fiercely, and the German air force concentrated on bombing the retreating troops of the enemy, the transportation routes, and the rear transportation equipment. The German army obtained the cooperation of the air force, and advanced fiercely step by step according to the original plan. The enemy's railways and important highways have been bombed and damaged. The German navy used sophisticated technology to lay mines off the coast of southern Phi. Such an adventurous and courageous act has terrified the enemy, because Britain has strict defenses with the help of the southern Phi air force. According to this, Germany is not only taking the initiative in the land and air forces, but also in the navy. (Haitong Agency, 20th)</p>
<p>Berlin: After the main Belgian defense line was broken, a person close to the German command headquarters told the Haitong Agency reporter that there were three important events in yesterday's battle: (1) The Allied forces in northern Belgium and France have completely retreated; (2) The German army is pursuing the victory and advancing directly to the west; (3) The Allied forces are retreating in two directions, northwest and southwest. (Haitong Agency, 20th)</p>
<p>Berlin: According to a report from the German command headquarters, the German army has captured a total of 100,000 prisoners in recent days. Among them, there are only a few thousand British prisoners, which shows that the number of British troops fighting on the Western Front is still not as large as that of its allies. (Haitong Agency, 20th)</p>
<p>Berlin: German war correspondent Schmidtke recently described the defeat of the French heavy tanks by the German army, saying that the fierce battle on the Meuse River has collapsed the stubborn resistance of the French army. The speed of the German advance is like lightning. The enemy army did not have time to retreat and was almost completely disorganized. The French heavy tanks were bombarded by the German artillery units and could not withstand it and retreated. Among them, the steel plates of 19 tanks were 6 centimeters thick and were extremely strong and could be described as small mobile fortresses. The length of the car was 7 feet, and the height and width were 3 meters. However, the German anti-tank guns finally defeated them. (Haitong Agency, 20th)</p>
<p>Berlin: A German radio station reported last night that the German army is only 62 miles from Paris. According to official military intelligence, German troops have approached certain important French and Belgian fortresses on the Dover Strait opposite England. This advance is like that of 1914. (Reuter's, 20th)</p>
<p>Forts of Liège and Namur Still Held by Belgian Troops</p>
<p>London: A local radio station recently issued a message stating that although the forts of Liège and Namur in Belgium have been heavily surrounded by the enemy and have been subjected to constant and fierce bombing by enemy aircraft, they are still being held by Belgian troops. The enemy's repeated attacks have all failed, and corpses are scattered all around the forts. (Havas, 19th)</p>
<p>London: The Belgian army is still holding the forts of Liège and Namur, which is a model of the Belgian army's heroic resistance. These two places are both extremely important points, because every railway leading to the current German front line must pass through Liège or Namur, and the German army relies on these railways to transport military supplies. London experts believe that even if the Belgian army does nothing else and only holds these two forts, it is still fulfilling its full responsibility in the efforts of the Allied forces.

<h3>比境歐本等區　德國併入版圖　殷嘉德被任為駐荷專員</h3>
<p>Berlin. The German official news agency announced that Hitler has appointed Inquart (former Austrian Minister of the Interior) as Commissioner for the German-occupied territories in the Netherlands. At the same time, Hitler ordered the incorporation of Eupen, Malmedy, and Moresnet areas of Belgium into Germany. It is noted that after World War I, the Treaty of Versailles stipulated that Germany should cede the Eupen and Malmedy areas to Belgium. The Moresnet area was once a neutral zone between Prussia and Belgium, and was assigned to Belgium after the war as compensation for damage done by Germans to Belgian forests. In his new position, Inquart will be responsible for maintaining public order and life in the German-occupied territories in the Netherlands, reporting to Hitler and wielding supreme power over the Dutch civilians. However, the supreme military power will remain in the hands of the German commander in the Netherlands, who has the power to take necessary measures to ensure military order and security. Current Dutch laws that are compatible with the German occupation will remain in effect. (Reuters, 20th)</p>
<h3>倫敦各報　觀察戰局　雖頗嚴重　但非絕望</h3>
<p>London. Today, all newspapers here strongly argue that the war situation, although serious, is not hopeless. The Daily Telegraph reports that although the war has now extended to the northeastern borders of France, the decisive moment is still far away. The path of the Nazi mechanized forces' advance yesterday was the same route that the German army took to enter France in 1914. We must not overlook the heavy losses of the German army and the danger that the German westward attack poses to the Allied front lines, nor can we judge the war situation based on the extent of territory occupied by the German army after breaking through the Meuse River line of defense. The outcome of the war depends on the Allied powers' ability to prevent sufficient German infantry from arriving. If rear support cannot arrive continuously, the advance of its armored vehicle units will come to a halt, and the tank columns will not be able to survive. Currently, the fighting around the German breakthrough is becoming increasingly fierce. It is difficult to predict when the limits of human effort can be reached in this terrible mechanized warfare. According to eyewitness reports, although German soldiers are piling up like mountains, the Nazis' cruel discipline has not been lost for a single day. The ability to drive German men to engage in slaughter remains, and Hitler may not be able to spare his "cannon fodder." However, once the machinery is destroyed or its fuel is cut off, no matter how cruel, it cannot be driven to action. French artillery has engaged German tanks, and aerial bombing has destroyed many vehicles. Our air force has been paying attention to reconnaissance of German transportation routes, especially the highways and railways of the Ardennes, and has discovered that they are insufficient to support a large-scale offensive. Therefore, the German advance may be forced to halt due to transportation failures. The Times reports that the German army's massive offensive has already sown the seeds of its own failure, and its maturity is only a matter of time. There is no tendency towards discouragement in Britain regarding the current war situation. Our attitude towards France's struggle against adversity is fully demonstrated by Prime Minister Churchill's recent trip to Paris. Churchill's trip carried encouragement for the struggle, all possible assistance, and the assurance of the fullest cooperation between the two countries in the current great endeavor. All our hopes are pinned on General Georges and his troops, who are fighting for the safety of Britain and France and the future of civilization. Regardless of the future of this war or how it develops, our determination and goals will remain unchanged. (Reuters, 20th)</p>
<h3>德軍方面　又一新武器　燃燒手溜彈</h3>
<p>Berlin. The German side announced today that Germany has now produced a powerful new secret weapon, the incendiary hand grenade. This weapon can melt the most solid equipment of the Maginot Line. According to the German authorities, this weapon contains a heat of 2,000 degrees, which can make guns useless and burn to death those inside the pillboxes. This weapon has been used at the Belgian fortresses of Eben-Emael and Émeraude north of Liège. (United Press, 20th)</p>
<h3>比政府　遷往法境　聖亞特萊斯鎭</h3>
<p>Ostend, Belgium. German squadrons of aircraft continuously flew over and bombed this city on the nights of the 17th and 18th of this month. Belgium has therefore requested France to move its government to the town of Saint-Adresse near the port of Le Havre in France, as it did during the last European war. It is also learned that the British and French ambassadors left at 11 a.m. (Havas, 19th)</p>
<p>Le Havre, France. After the Belgian government moved to Saint-Adresse near this port, several members of the cabinet, such as Minister of Justice Janssens, Minister of Colonies Chabanel, and Minister of Health Jaspar, have arrived in the town. Among them, Jaspar has gone to Paris to prepare to go to London. In addition, Belgian Foreign Minister Spaak has also arrived there, and the Ministries of Foreign Affairs and National Defense have begun working. (Havas, 20th)</p>

<p>Rome. Foreign Minister Ciano clearly stated yesterday in Milan to 75,000 people that Italy intends to join the European war. The Italian nation "cannot stand apart from the rise and fall of Europe's destiny." Ciano also spoke at the anniversary of the German-Italian axis, stating, "Italy will honor its responsibilities... and move towards its greater destiny." He also said that Italy will be recognized at the final end of the war, and the crowd frequently held up slogans such as "Long Live Italy." Ciano also emphasized, "The need to achieve our ultimate natural desires is essential for our nation's life and indispensable." He said that Prime Minister Mussolini will issue orders soon. (United Press, 20th)</p>
<p>Milan. Foreign Minister Ciano recently delivered a speech to the Blackshirt Army in the square in front of the cathedral here, stating that "The Italian people must be prepared to cope with new responsibilities. These responsibilities are indicated by the following three ideas: Our country is a sovereign state and should protect its rights, this is the first. Our country's wishes are extremely just and essential for survival, so they can be called natural desires and should eventually be realized, this is the second. Our country should maintain the prestige of a great power and keep its promises and destiny, this is the third. Our Italian nation has fought in Abyssinia and Spain, and cannot stand apart from European events, it must have the right to speak, and it will be able to speak. Once our leader (referring to Mussolini) makes a decision, we will receive instructions. It must be known that these instructions are issued by our one and only leader, who is our only leader in peacetime, and also in wartime." (Havas, 19th)</p>

In addition, the government authorities have also issued an order prohibiting the export of Egyptian and foreign currency abroad. The currency carried by tourists leaving the country must not exceed 20 pounds. As for those coming to Egypt to travel, they should declare the foreign currency they are carrying to the government upon entry. (Havas, 20th)</p>
<h3>邱吉爾廣播　承認大局嚴重　以動人之詞表示決心　採嚴峻步驟剛毅作戰</h3>
<p>London. Prime Minister Churchill, last night gave a broadcast speech to the nation and the Empire, expressing in moving terms his strong confidence in the French army and its leaders, and expressing the resolute determination to fight until victory is achieved.</p>
<p>Strong Confidence in French Army Leaders</p>
<p>The Prime Minister said, "I have received the most solemn assurances from the leaders of the French Republic, especially the strong Prime Minister Reynaud, stating that no matter how the future changes, they will fight to the end. The result may be pain or glory, but if we fight to the end, what we can obtain is glory alone."</p>
<p>The Prime Minister continued, "If this is one of the most shocking times in the long history of France and Britain, it is also one of the noblest times. There is no doubt that the people of Britain and France are standing shoulder to shoulder, receiving assistance only from their great dominions and the friends of their vast empires. Now they are advancing shoulder to shoulder to save not only Europe but also mankind from the poison of the most despicable and soul-destroying tyrants, who have stained the pages of history."</p>
<p>"Behind them, behind us, behind the British and French armies and navies, are several broken countries and oppressed nations, namely the Czech Republic, Poland, Norway, Denmark, the Netherlands, and Belgium. The long night of barbarism will now descend upon them, and even if there are stars of hope, they will not be enough to break it unless we win. But we must win, and we will win."</p>
<p>Both Sides are in Dangerous Positions</p>
<p>"I am addressing you today as Prime Minister for the first time at one of the most solemn moments in the life of our country, the Empire, ourselves, and our allies. More importantly, I am making this statement for the sake of freedom. A fierce battle is currently taking place in France and Flanders. The German army, with the aid of fierce aerial bombardment and heavy armored tanks, has broken through the French defenses north of the Maginot Line. Their large numbers of armored vehicles are now trampling across the plains, which, in the first few days, had no defending troops at all. The German army has now advanced deeply and is spreading fear and disruption along the way. Behind them are trucks full of infantry, and behind the trucks are large numbers of soldiers, pouring forward continuously. Therefore, the French army is reorganizing to resist the enemy and strike them. This extended wedge has been advancing for several days and has been aided by the heroic performance of the Royal Air Force. We must not be shocked by the sudden appearance of these armored vehicles in various places behind our lines. If they have reached behind our lines, the French army is also fighting behind the enemy lines in many places. Both sides are now in extremely dangerous positions. If the French army and our army can fight well, and I believe they will, if the French army can maintain its long-standing reputation for recovery and counterattack, and if the British army can persevere and fight hard, as there have been many examples in the past, then the war situation may suddenly change."</p>
<p>"However, it would be foolish to try to conceal the seriousness of the situation today. It would be even more foolish to lose heart or believe that a large, well-trained and equipped army of three to four million men can be overcome in a matter of weeks or months by the rapid attacks of mechanized vehicles. For even though mechanized vehicles are fierce, they have no such ability. We can have great confidence in the stability of the French lines, and the British and French soldiers will certainly demonstrate their quality in this fierce battle, which is comparable to that of the enemy. This can be seen with our own eyes."</p>
<p>"As for me personally, my confidence in the French army and its leaders is unshakable. Only a small part of the French army is currently engaged in fierce fighting, and only a small part of French territory has been invaded. There is now good evidence that the enemy has actually committed all of its special mechanized units to the major war. We also know that they have suffered very heavy losses."</p>
<p>Restoring the Initiative Depends on Valor</p>
<p>"All those who encounter the enemy and engage in close combat, whether they are officers or soldiers, whether they are brigades or divisions, can make valuable contributions to the overall result. The military authorities must abandon the idea that they can only defend against the enemy's attacks by relying on natural obstacles and strong defensive lines. They must know that restoring the initiative depends on a valiant and unyielding offensive. This spirit should not only encourage high command but also be instilled in every soldier. In the sky, we often win with fewer numbers, and the disparity in numbers is often a ratio of three or four to one. The balance of power between the British and German air forces has now put us in an advantageous position, which is very different from when the war broke out. We are not only fighting for ourselves, but also fighting for the French army, and we are reducing the number of German bombers day by day. My confidence in our air force's ability to fight to the end with the German air force has been strengthened by the fierce battles that have taken place in the past and are taking place now. At the same time, our heavy bombers are now striking at the root of Germany's mechanized power, as they have heavily damaged the oil refineries on which the Nazis' efforts to dominate the world directly depend. Now that the enemy, who is expected to destroy the Netherlands and turn it into ashes in a few days, will turn to attack us once the Western Front is stabilized, we must be prepared for this."</p>
<p>Encouraging the People to Serve the Country</p>
<p>"When I say that we are prepared to deal with this attack and will endure it and retaliate as far as the unwritten laws of war allow, I dare to say that I am speaking to the entire nation. If calamities befall this island in the future, every man and every woman will share the dangers faced by our sons on the front lines, such as soldiers, sailors, and pilots, and by doing so, at least reduce part of the attacks suffered on the front lines, then they must be comforted at heart and even proud. At this time, shouldn't everyone in the nation do their best to serve the country? If we want the war to be won, we must supply the nation's needs with an ever-increasing supply of arms and ammunition. We must quickly produce more aircraft, tanks, and artillery shells. All these important munitions are needed in huge quantities. This can increase our strength to resist a heavily armed enemy. This can compensate for the increased consumption in combat. If the soldiers on the front lines know that the munitions consumed can be quickly replenished, they will use the abundant munitions even faster."</p>
<p>"Our task is not only to win one battle but to win the overall victory. When the current major war in France can reduce its strength, the major war on this island will begin. By this island, I mean the entire United Kingdom. In this moment of supreme emergency, we will not hesitate and take all kinds of steps, even the most severe steps, to exert our last effort."</p>
<p>"The interests of industry and the hours of work are not worth considering compared to the struggle for life and honor, for life and freedom are what everyone of us depends on for survival. I have received the most solemn assurances from the leaders of France, stating that no matter how the future changes, they will fight to the end until victory is achieved. Entrusted by the King, I have formed a government of men and women from all parties, including various opinions. We used to argue with each other because of differing opinions, but now we are united to wage war, and we will not rest until victory is achieved, no matter how great the price or how deep the pain, we will never surrender to slavery and disgrace."

<h3>羅斯福論改進　自由經濟　為美重要政策</h3>
<p>Washington. US Secretary of State Hull, last night read a message from President Roosevelt on a radio broadcast, stating that one of the most important parts of the United States' foreign policy is to improve free economic policy.

<h3>英轟炸機隊　破壞德交通綫　戰鬥機隊從事攻勢巡邏</h3>
<p>London. The British Air Ministry announced that British bomber squadrons were very active in Belgium and France yesterday, with the aim of disrupting the German army's transportation lines and relieving the pressure on the Allied forces. When our fighter jets assisted the bomber squadrons in patrolling, they shot down many enemy aircraft of various types. According to the first received report, which only mentioned the activities of our fighter jets, at least 20 enemy aircraft have been shot down. At night, our heavy bomber squadrons continued to harass the enemy, bombing bridges and roads in southern Belgium to block them, and dispersing enemy concentrations. At the same time, other bomber squadrons flew deep into Germany at night to Hanau and hit oil tanks, and attacked other railway junctions and branch lines in various places, causing heavy damage. British aircraft continuously monitored military traffic and frequently attacked enemy actions over a vast area of western Germany throughout the night, bombing railway and highway traffic. A certain point was hit and exploded with a loud noise, and buildings at an airfield caught fire. Hudson-style British aircraft also carried out night attacks, causing continued damage to oil tanks in Hamburg and Bremen. Two Blenheim-style British aircraft patrolled off the coast of the Netherlands and attacked three German Heinkel 111s and three Messerschmitt 110s, shooting down two Messerschmitt-style German aircraft. According to a subsequent communiqué issued by the Air Ministry, British Air Force fighter jets carried out offensive patrols over France and Belgium yesterday. One squadron of Hurricane fighter jets shot down three to six Heinkel-style German aircraft near Brussels. Another squadron with a larger number of aircraft only encountered two enemy aircraft. It is believed that one of the enemy aircraft, a Heinkel 111, has been shot down. (Reuters, 20th)</p>
<p>Berlin. According to the German military newspaper yesterday, 147 enemy aircraft were shot down. Over the skies near Tournai, 12 German Messerschmitt bombers and 20 French Morane fighters were shot down. Four French Potez 63s were shot down immediately. In addition, a British Bleriot bomber, which was parked at the airfield, was also destroyed. At the French Air Force base in Vitry-le-François, many French Morane aircraft were bombed and burned while refueling, when the German Air Force attacked. At another airfield, when the German Air Force bombed, 16 French Morane aircraft and 4 Potez aircraft were destroyed. On the same day, aircraft at many other airfields were also bombed.

<h3>降落傘隊　作戰方法　德國效法於蘇聯</h3>
<p>Stockholm. The Swedish "Dagens Nyheter" recently published a dispatch from Moscow stating that the German army's use of paratroopers in the Western Front to achieve victory was actually invented by the late Soviet Deputy People's Commissar for Defense, General Tukhachevsky (who was executed in the purge). His original plan was to train 100,000 paratroopers and form them into an elite force. For several years, the Soviet authorities had been training 60,000 people in accordance with his will, but abandoned it halfway because they later revealed this secret to Germany. Unexpectedly, once Germany imitated this method, it established a miraculous feat in the Western Front war. (Havas, 20th)</p>
<h3>荷印遠征軍　赴歐參戰　各校廢德文課程</h3>
<p>Singapore. A report from Batavia last night stated that a Dutch East Indies expeditionary force departed for Europe yesterday to participate in the Allied forces' war.

<h3>French Premier Warns the Nation</h3>
<p>Paris: Premier Reynaud has cautioned the people of the nation not to readily believe enemy propaganda, stating that the enemy is attempting to undermine our nation’s production by spreading false rumors, such as the relocation of our industrial heartland due to the German advance. In reality, our industrial zones are under no threat and need no relocation, which should be decided by the military and political authorities. The government will severely punish those who spread such rumors. (Havas dispatch, 20th)</p>

<h3>The Puppet Regime in Beiping Receives Lukewarm Reception from the Japanese; Old Five-Color Flag Still Used; Independent Status Unaffected</h3>
<p>A Beiping dispatch in the *North-China Daily News*, dated May 4th, states that Beiping celebrated the establishment of the "new regime" from April 25th to 27th, but the public and the authorities were apathetic. There were few signs of celebration anywhere. Even the paper flower arches erected in one or two main thoroughfares lacked banners or slogans explaining the meaning of the celebration. The "mass rally" held in front of the Taihe Gate was attended by</p>
<p>very few people. Speakers delivered lengthy, monotonous speeches over loudspeakers. Despite their vocal exertions, they failed to arouse the slightest interest among the audience. Delegates from the surrounding rural areas were escorted to the rally by large groups of police, ostensibly to prevent these "volunteers" from escaping midway. Of particular note, although the celebrations were for the establishment of the "new regime," no "Kuomintang flag" was to be seen. The marchers all carried</p>
<p>the old five-color flag. A Japanese spokesperson attempted to explain this by saying, "This is purely a spontaneous celebration by the Chinese people. The Japanese cannot interfere. The Xinminhui, which initiated the march, adopted the five-color flag." However, the spokesperson could not explain why, if the Chinese people were celebrating the "new regime," they were carrying the flag of the "Xinminhui." Even if he did, it would not have helped, because</p>
<p>the Japanese in North China have openly expressed their aversion to the puppet regime. At the official celebration held in Zhongnanhai Park, Wang Kemin and other "members of the North China Political Affairs Commission," as well as senior Japanese civil and military officials, delivered speeches. They rarely mentioned the puppet regime, focusing instead on the suppression of the Communists and the many difficulties that still lay ahead. Chinese newspapers here say that the public administrative organs in North China will henceforth be prefixed with "North China" and will remove the previously used "Central." It is strange that the resolutions of a special meeting recently held here by the Asia Development Board have not been disclosed. It is rumored that the reason for the silence after the meeting is that difficulties have arisen between North China and the "new regime"</p>
<p>over financial issues. All of this clearly indicates that the purpose and independent status of the North China regime have not been affected by the establishment of the "new regime." The timing of the celebration of the new regime here coincided with an attack on Kaifeng by Chinese regular forces, which was a great anticlimax. The Japanese side has denied the Chongqing claim of killing 2,000 Japanese soldiers, but it is</p>
<p>a fact that Chinese regular forces penetrated the center of Kaifeng. The incident appears to have been a surprise attack by Chinese forces on a small Japanese garrison in Kaifeng at dawn, penetrating the city center. Although they withdrew after Japanese reinforcements arrived, the Chinese forces achieved a brief victory that</p>
<p>greatly undermined the prestige of the Japanese army, which had repeatedly boasted that all of North China was now pacified. This also confirms the opinions repeatedly expressed by foreign military observers, that the Japanese are now trying to maintain the countryside with insufficient troops, and that their position is extremely precarious if attacked by Chinese forces. There are also reports of continuous fierce fighting in southern Shanxi, which can be confirmed by</p>
<p>the continuous return of large numbers of wounded soldiers and cremation ashes to the north. Even the suburbs of Beiping are not peaceful. Fighting continues on the slopes across the Hun River. Four days ago, Chinese regular forces intercepted a long-distance bus on the main road south of Changxindian. From this, it can be concluded that if Tokyo truly believes that the establishment of the puppet regime can quickly end armed resistance in China or resolve the "China Incident" in a short period of time, then it is overly optimistic.</p>
<h3>Armies Contend for Decisive Points in Chaojie; Intense Fighting Between Qingma Mountain and Fengxi</h3>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: In the battle situation in eastern Guangdong, Chinese and Japanese forces are vying for decisive points on the Anjie border. Chinese troops are stationed in Jieyang, while Japanese troops are concentrated in Chao'an City, Fort City, and Qingma Mountain. The Japanese army must attack the commanding heights to invade Jieyang, and the Chinese army is determined to defend them. Fengxi and Fuyang are the main transportation routes of Chaoshan, and they are the commanding heights for the Chinese army to recover lost land. The Japanese army is determined to defend them. In recent months, both sides have engaged in a tug-of-war, sacrificing countless soldiers, all for this purpose.</p>
<p>On April 25th, Chinese forces recovered Dengtang, a stronghold on the Anjie road. On the 28th and 29th, they fiercely attacked Datouling, Fugang, and Shaxi (northeast of Sangpu Mountain) west of the Chaoshan Railway. New artillery units also mobilized to assist in the battle. On the afternoon of the 28th, Datouling was captured, annihilating over a hundred Japanese soldiers. On the morning of the 29th, Fugang was captured. The remaining Japanese soldiers retreated in disarray to Anbu. After May 1st, large numbers of Chinese troops arrived continuously to reinforce the defenses of Fort City, Fugang, Yujiao, and Dengtang, and attacked Qingma Mountain, Lianhu, and Baishui Village. These locations were Japanese artillery positions with four layers of barbed wire. On the 3rd, Chinese forces completely surrounded them, broke through the nets, and engaged in bayonet fighting on the northern slopes of Qingma Mountain. After six hours of intense fighting, they occupied it, capturing a large amount of ammunition, equipment, and documents. The remaining Japanese soldiers retreated to Fuyang Station. The Japanese and puppet forces in Chao'an City were greatly alarmed and increased their troops to defend Mabei, Chihu, Xiasi, and Zhugaoshan. Chinese forces took advantage of the victory to pursue them fiercely. On the 4th, they once charged into Fuyang City. Japanese commander Hori urgently dispatched 1,000 Japanese and puppet troops from Shantou and Anbu to reinforce. The Japanese and puppet forces in Shantou and Chenghai were unusually busy with troop movements. At dawn on the 5th, 400 Japanese soldiers (with cavalry and artillery) from Chao'an City left the west gate, passing through Xiasi to defend Fengxi. The artillery fire was extremely intense. The vanguard of the Chinese army quickly retreated out of Fengxi and scattered in the fields. In the afternoon, Chinese reinforcements arrived and launched a counterattack in multiple directions. Those who set out from Tiandongxu in Fengshun attacked Guihu, Toutang, and Pojieling upstream of Chao'an, capturing several strongholds in succession and approaching Zhugaoshan and Yixi Station. The Japanese troops on Bijia Mountain, Danganshi, Yuntishan, and Aoling Mountain in the suburbs of Chao'an fired in response. The artillery fire was deafening, preventing Chinese troops from approaching Chao'an City. Therefore, troops were sent south from Linmapo to flank the Japanese troops in Fengxi. At ten o'clock that night, the Chinese troops approaching Chao'an City directly attacked Guxiang in Fengxi, echoing the Chinese troops who went south from Linjiapo. The Jing army suffered over 300 casualties after a day and night of bloody battles and stubbornly resisted the dangerous situation. On the 6th, they were trapped in Fengxi awaiting assistance, in a very embarrassing situation. On the morning of the same day at five o'clock, the Japanese army also dispatched a warship to Yixi to anchor, firing more than ten shots at Gulong and Zhuxiang (twenty li above Chao'an City on the Han River) to cover two Japanese electric boats attempting to transport troops to shore. Local militias fired wildly, preventing the Japanese electric boats from approaching the shore. Around 7:00 AM, the Japanese warship began to retreat. At this time, Shantou had no troops to dispatch. Over a hundred puppet troops from Waisha in Chenghai were transferred to Longhu to land, intending to go to Fuyang to assist in the battle. Local villagers (in the occupied area) feared being robbed and resisted by sounding gongs, engaging in a fierce battle with the Japanese and puppet troops for an hour. The Japanese and puppet troops suffered over thirty casualties and it was difficult to pass through the village, so they retreated one after another, leaving in boats. Before leaving, they declared that they would carry out a clear-out of the villages. At this time, the Chinese mobile units had already penetrated deep into the Chaoshan railway line. On the evening of the 8th, Wang's troops attacked Huamei Station, engaging in hand-to-hand combat with the Japanese troops for thirty minutes, killing over thirty Japanese soldiers and burning a Japanese vehicle. Another unit attacked Shilong in Anbu, annihilating over forty Japanese and puppet troops. Thirteen Chinese soldiers heroically sacrificed their lives. After the 9th, the battles in Chao'an and Shantou became more intense. Chinese forces have already occupied all the strongholds on the Anjie road. The prospect of victory is very promising.</p>

<h3>Western Football Association Punishes Lido; Banned From Participating Next Season</h3>
<p>The Western Football Association has abused its authority and applied high pressure to the Lido Football Team due to the charity match of Liu Fashang. In addition to punishing the two players Meng Yiliang and Jiang Zhaoxiang by suspending their participation in the entire 1940-1941 season, it also notified the football associations in Hong Kong and Tianjin that Meng and Jiang should not be allowed to participate in football matches in Tianjin and Hong Kong. At the same time, the Lido Sports Association was fined 50 yuan. If it is not paid, the qualifications for participating in the 1940-1941 league and Wei Cup will be cancelled. The intention of embarrassing Chinese teams and the prejudice against Chinese teams has become clear. The penalties, except for the suspension of Meng and Jiang, have been enforced early. The Lido association hopes that Lido will yield to pressure and obey, but it has never thought that such unreasonable measures of abusing power will be resented by all Chinese people. Lido is willing to sacrifice for charity, but for the sake of the integrity of the entire Chinese nation, it is also unwilling to be submissive. Therefore, the punishment notice from the Western association was ignored. The Western association, because the deadline for paying the fine has been exceeded, became angry and blatantly ignored the situation. It suddenly notified Lido the other day, saying, "The deadline for paying the fine has been exceeded, and the right of Lido to participate in the 1940-1941 competition has been cancelled. Even if the fine is paid in full, this penalty of cancelling the right to compete for one season must be enforced," and so on.</p>

<h3>Women's Youth Table Tennis Training Class to Hold Test Today</h3>
<p>Ms. He Xuchu, Director of the Sports Department of the Young Women's Christian Association (YWCA) at 999 Jing'an Temple Road in this city, has organized two "Women's Table Tennis Training Classes" successively in order to promote women's table tennis and cultivate talent. More than 100 people have participated, revitalizing the formerly quiet women's table tennis scene and producing numerous talents. Although players such as Huang Tongyin, Zhang Yongru, Wang Guangmei, Fang Xiuwen, Zhu Shangxin, Hu Jiahe, Zhu Min, Xu Ruilan, He Jinxia, Tao Lanying, and Wang Mingxia have practiced for less than a year, their skill level is comparable to that of famous female players in Shanghai such as Liang Yujie, Lin Jinlan, Zhang Jiazhen, Cai Xiuyu, Xiao Weiqing, and Yan Wenjun. This is the biggest accomplishment of the YWCA's enthusiastic promotion. The third training class organized by the YWCA has concluded after three months of training. A general test for all students will be held at 4:00 PM today (the 21st) in the auditorium of the YWCA. Mr. Chen Linsheng, the instructor, will personally conduct the assessment.

<h3>Finance: Foreign Exchange Selling Spree Unmatched</h3>
<p>In the foreign exchange market yesterday, HSBC quoted higher for sterling, up 2.5, and lower for US dollars, down 0.3125. Other currencies also generally quoted higher. In the unofficial market, loose prices appeared frequently. The US dollar was about to break the 6 yuan mark. The European war stimulated people's minds, and it was widely believed to be unfavorable for the bullish side. At the beginning of the morning, speculators sold enthusiastically. The spot US dollar was quoted as high as 5.75 at its strongest. However, it was heard that the Stabilization Committee intervened at the 4.25 line, which hindered the weakening trend. Afterwards, the selling spree revived, and the US dollar actually reached 5.99375. Later, due to strong demand from foreign banks and rumors that the Stabilization Fund Committee had absorbed as much as 300,000 pounds sterling, and because speculators stopped selling and started buying before the close, prices rebounded. As a result, sterling was 4.23475, and the US dollar was 5.75, which was up 0.125 for sterling and down 0.21875 for the US dollar compared to last Saturday. The futures market was weakening.</p>
<p>US Dollar Nears 6 Yuan Mark</p>
<p>In the morning, exchange rates saw slight movements, with sterling rising 0.09375 against the US dollar and remaining unchanged against the French franc. The US dollar rose 0.01 against the British pound and 0.1 against the Shanghai currency, while the French franc rose 0.075. The central bank's quoted rates for various currencies remained the same. Banks opened the spot selling price in the morning with sterling at 4.03125 and the US dollar at 5.53125, compared to last Saturday's close, the US dollar was flat and sterling was slightly firmer by 0.015625 due to the rebound in exchange rates. After the opening, there was a strong selling spree, and there was a considerable lack of buyers. It is estimated that Chinese speculators aggressively sold the foreign banks 5-month US dollar futures at 5.5 to 6.25, and the market had indeed loosened. Moreover, the Bank of America and the Mercantile Bank had previously sold sterling to the Yokohama Specie Bank at 4.03125 for June delivery. HSBC's quoted prices were announced, with sterling up 0.25 and the US dollar down 0.3125. Other currencies also generally strengthened. The silver equalization tax was announced and remained unchanged. After that, Chinese speculators continued to sell without buying, relying only on HSBC and other banks to absorb the supply, but the situation remained firm overall. It is estimated that Chinese banks sold spot sterling to HSBC, quoting 4.23125, and speculators sold US dollars to foreign banks at 5.6875 and 5.75. The Yokohama Specie Bank sold to HSBC and Mercantile Bank at 5.6875 to 5.75. Therefore, the situation at the close appeared even firmer than before. Foreign banks and American banks were trading spot US dollars at a constant rate of 5.75. As a result, sterling closed at 4.21875 and the US dollar at 5.75. Sterling for this month was 4.1875 and the US dollar was 5.71875. Sterling for June was 4.03125 and the US dollar was 5.46875, which was up 0.1875 for sterling and down 0.21875 for the US dollar compared to the morning opening spot rates. Futures were generally firmer.</p>
<p>Stabilization Committee Rumored to be Absorbing</p>
<p>In the early afternoon, the market was even weaker than before. Speculators continued to sell, estimating that 5-month US dollar futures were sold to foreign banks at 5.75 and 5.8125. Foreign banks also traded spot US dollars at 5.8125. Subsequently, it was rumored that Qian Dui Ye sold US dollars to the China-Italy Bank at a low of 5.9375, but because foreign banks' appetite improved, speculators switched from selling to buying, estimating that they bought 5-month futures from foreign banks at 5.75 and 5.6875. It was also rumored that the Stabilization Fund Committee had absorbed a considerable amount of sterling at the 4.25 level. By the evening, foreign banks had buying without selling, so prices recovered. As a result, sterling was 4.234375, and the US dollar was 5.75. Sterling for this month was 4.21875, and the US dollar was 5.71875. Sterling for the next month was 4.0625, and the US dollar was 5.46875, which was up 0.125 for spot sterling and down 0.21875 for the US dollar compared to last Saturday's close. May and June futures were down 0.15625 for sterling and up 0.28125 for the US dollar.</p>

<h3>Gold Prices Plummet Unceasingly, Lowest Drop to 5,230 Yuan, Hong Kong Banks Suddenly Active Before Closing, Incline to Buy</h3>
<p>Yesterday's spot gold in the unofficial market continued its downward spiral, plummeting to 5,230 yuan at one point, almost breaking through the 5,000 yuan mark. Fortunately, buying momentum returned at the end, closing at 5,500 yuan, but this was still a sharp drop of 365 yuan compared to the end of last week. In terms of buying and selling, the general feeling was that the drop was too drastic, and there were not many transactions. Generally, speculators had no appetite to enter, and there were only opportunistic trades. The market opened 165 yuan lower in the morning due to the setbacks of the Allied forces in the European war, which was unfavorable to the bullish side. The opening price was 5,700 yuan, followed by a further drop to 5,600 yuan due to the extreme weakness of foreign exchange and the vigorous selling by banks. Subsequently, rumors of a turnaround in the Allied military situation triggered buying, raising the price by more than 100 yuan. Ultimately, the above news soon dissipated. At that time, gold shops and banks entered the market to sell, and silver shops also sold a lot. Although some gold shops and securities firms intervened to absorb the supply, they were overwhelmed by the overwhelming selling pressure, causing the price to fall to 5,470 yuan. At noon, banks covered their short positions at 5,500 yuan as the closing price. In the afternoon, as the foreign exchange market became firmer, the price fell from the opening price of 5,420 yuan to a low of 5,230 yuan, the lowest price of the day, significantly affected by the massive selling by securities firms and the cheap selling by banks. However, the exchange market suddenly rebounded, and cash shops and silver shops all entered, and a certain silver shop and gold shop secretly searched for purchases on behalf of Hong Kong banks. Buying momentum suddenly rose, causing the closing price to jump to 5,500 yuan, a decrease of 365 yuan compared to the previous Saturday noon close. Trading throughout the day was quite brisk, with an estimated volume of more than 4,000 taels. Silver shop jewelry was quoted 30 yuan lower, and customs gold remained flat.</p>
<p>Spot Gold Falls 365 Yuan</p>
<p>From the morning, each tael (ten taels) initially dropped 165 yuan due to the weakness of the exchange market and reports of unfavorable news for the Allied forces in the European war, leading to widespread selling. The market opened with banks selling gold to gold shops at 5,700 yuan. Subsequently, due to the still firm exchange rate, silver shops sold to each other, and silver shops also sold, dropping another 100 yuan. Silver shops sold 20 taels to banks for 5,600 yuan. Later, news suddenly spread in the market of a turnaround in the European Allied forces war situation, and the weakening trend of the exchange market stabilized slightly, triggering buying, with gold shops and retail investors all buying in, resulting in a rebound of 120 yuan. Banks sold 10 taels to gold shops for 5,720 yuan. Ultimately, due to the sharp weakening of the exchange rate, a new round of selling began, with gold shops and banks selling even more. Soon, the price fell 240 yuan. Silver shops sold 50 taels to silver shops for 5,480 yuan. At that time, a certain gold shop saw the low price and bought aggressively, with a very large amount, estimated to be over 1,000 taels. The price then rebounded 120 yuan. Gold shops bought 20 taels from banks for 5,600 yuan. However, due to the renewed aggressive selling by the bank group, and the certain gold shop having stopped buying, the price fell sharply again by 130 yuan. Gold shops traded 30 taels with each other for 5,470 yuan. Near the close, gold shops came in to buy, and the price rebounded by 60 yuan. Banks bought 20 taels from securities firms for 5,530 yuan. However, due to the selling by securities firms, the noon close remained at only 5,500 yuan. In the afternoon, selling sentiment prevailed at the opening, dropping by 80 yuan. Securities firms sold 30 taels to banks for 5,420 yuan. Subsequently, relying on the slight buying by Qian Dui Ye and gold shops, the price rebounded by 30 yuan. Gold shops bought 10 taels from banks for 5,450 yuan. However, due to the weakness of the exchange market and the massive selling by securities firms and banks, the price plummeted by 220 yuan. Banks sold 10 taels to gold shops for 5,230 yuan. Later, with cash shops and silver shops buying in, and a certain gold shop and silver shop frequently searching for purchases on behalf of customer groups, and the exchange market also rebounding, sellers gradually decreased, leading to a rebound of 280 yuan. Gold shops sold 10 taels to Qian Dui Ye for 5,510 yuan. Then, gold shops bought 20 taels from silver shops for 5,500 yuan as the closing price, which was 365 yuan lower than last Saturday. After the close, the market continued to recover, with trades occurring at 5,560 yuan. The selling price of cash shops' own-brand gold was 10 yuan higher than the spot gold, and the buying price was 30 yuan lower. Spot standard gold was 50 yuan lower than the quoted gold, with few deals made.</p>
<p>Jewelry Revised Down to 570 Yuan</p>
<p>The selling price of jewelry per tael was initially still quoted at 600 yuan. Then, at 9:30 AM, it was revised down by 10 yuan. At 9:35 AM, it dropped another 10 yuan. At 10:05 AM, it continued to drop by 10 yuan. At 10:22 AM, it dropped another 10 yuan. At 10:27 AM, it rebounded by 10 yuan. In the afternoon, it dropped another 10 yuan at 2:00 PM. More than ten minutes later, it plummeted by 20 yuan. At 2:22 PM, it rebounded by 10 yuan. At 2:45 PM, it continued to rebound by 10 yuan. At 4:05 PM, it rebounded by 10 yuan again. As a result, it dropped by 30 yuan in total. It is estimated that the major companies revised their prices down to 570 yuan. New companies had the same price as the previous price, with the purchase price reduced by 30 yuan.</p>
<h3>Foreign Currency Declines Sharply, Slightly Recovers Towards Evening</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market saw gold-backed British and American pounds continue to plummet by as much as 7 yuan. The market price of sterling bills was very weak due to the continuous weakening of the black market sterling exchange rate, which led to continuous selling from all parties. The US dollar bill had already retreated to 16.95 yuan in the morning, and further news about Paris in the afternoon caused it to fall to 16.5 yuan. By around 4:00 PM, news that the Hong Kong Stabilization Committee suddenly inclined to buy foreign exchange made people feel at ease, and the evening market rose to 17.3 yuan, but it was still 0.45 yuan lower than last Saturday. Hong Kong bills fell sharply by 0.18 yuan along with the sharp drop in the Hong Kong-Shanghai exchange rate. In addition, bills such as French francs, Singapore dollars, rupees, Canadian dollars, and Philippine pesos were all weak. The supply of Japanese yen was also smooth, and the evening market retreated to 1.11 yuan. The supply and demand for Korean won was still balanced, and the evening market remained at 0.92 yuan.</p>
<h3>Exchange Bills and Discount Rates Stable</h3>
<p>Yesterday's exchange bill and discount rates were quite stable, consistently ranging from 120 yuan to 115 yuan per 1,000 yuan throughout the day, similar to last Saturday's price. The Qian Cai Gong Hui's overnight rate was raised by 0.03 in both the morning and afternoon markets, reaching 0.24 yuan.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: More Floating Losses Liquidated, Yarn Market Active, Double Horse Drops Another 75 Yuan</h3>
<p>The yarn market continued to decline, and the decline intensified sharply. This was because the European war was increasingly entangled, causing American and Indian cotton to plummet. As a result, people were panic-stricken, and speculators were anxious, liquidating floating losses with pain, causing market volatility. However, Hong Kong banks had a strong need for 20-count Double Horse and 10-count coarse yarn, which slightly saved the downward trend.</p>
<p>The morning opening of the current yarn market was as chaotic as hemp, with inconsistent shouting prices. The spot price of 20-count Double Horse was 1,305 yuan. A short while later, news of foreign exchange strengthening and gold falling led to immediate heavy selling, dropping straight to 1,200 yuan. Later, it was heard that Guangzhou banks had business for Double Horse, and the price rebounded by several tens of yuan. The half-day transaction statistics totaled 2,870 bales. The market price of 20-count Double Horse fell by 75 yuan. The breakdown of the amount purchased by various banks is listed as follows:</p>
<p>Counterparts 705 Ningbo 165</p>
<p>Hong Kong 2,000 Statistics 2,870</p>
<h3>Foreign Cotton Falls Frequently, Local Cotton Transactions Halted</h3>
<p>Local cotton transactions completely came to a halt. This was because the European war was expanding, and American and Indian cotton were falling frequently. At the same time, the yarn market was sluggish, causing widespread panic. Everyone was standing by and watching.</p>
<p>Another report is that in the foreign cotton market, the New York cotton market initially fell by more than 40 British pounds due to the Liverpool and Mumbai banks selling a massive 40,000 bales in the market. The cotton price then stabilized slightly. As a result, the closing market price fell by 30 British pounds compared to the previous day. The Indian market was quite weak, with the closing price falling by more than 20 rupees. Predictions for a rebound resulted in a drop of 6 rupees compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>Shanghai foreign cotton transactions have been quiet in recent days due to the low overseas market prices and the complexity of the European situation, with all parties tentatively planning to take a wait-and-see approach. However, it is generally predicted that Indian cotton will sign an agreement with Japan to exchange cotton for yarn, so Indian cotton is expected to rise. The following are the futures prices of US cotton delivered to the factory yesterday, converted at an exchange rate of 5.5 yuan per US dollar:</p>
<p>20 Count American Middling 315.70</p>
<p>Also Lower Grade 315.50</p>
<p>32 Count Ditto 340.20</p>
<p>Also Lower Grade 340.10</p>
<p>42 Count Ditto 352.90</p>
<p>Also Lower Grade 342.50</p>
<p>Indian cotton is continuously arriving today and tomorrow. It is reported that the British company's "Pertavan" (transliteration) postal ship arrived in Shanghai today, carrying 1,750 pieces of cotton from Mumbai, and will dock at the Qichang Wharf in Pudong for unloading. Also, the Italian ship "Kantirachai" (transliteration) will arrive in Shanghai tomorrow, carrying 1,345 tons of cotton from Calcutta, and will dock at the Gonghexing Wharf in Hongkou for unloading.</p>
<h3>Securities: Foreign Stocks Difficult to Curb Decline, Domestic Bonds Still Strong</h3>
<p>The securities trading situation yesterday was that as foreign exchange rates rose and gold prices fell, people's hearts gradually stabilized, and both short covering and new long positions rose in the market for public bonds. Class A bonds rose to 60 yuan, and Class C and E bonds also rose to 50 yuan. The market atmosphere was very good. The current situation is mostly favorable for long positions and short covering, but unfortunately the money supply is too tight, and the bullish side is ultimately constrained and cannot fully develop its strengths. Trading was sluggish in the morning and increased sharply in the afternoon. Lianhe searched for purchases very strongly. Hongda and Defu also had considerable intake. Jiufeng, Yichang, and Tiansheng also had interest in short covering and taking long positions. Hongkang consistently sold, and Tongshun and Xieda also sold at high prices. The market buying sentiment was very strong, and retail investors also bought more and sold less, and the trend clearly had a pattern of circling upwards. As a result, all bonds rose by 0.6 to 0.7 yuan. The total number of transactions was estimated to be around 1.3 million yuan. A brief table is listed below:</p>
<p>Category Highest Lowest Closing Compared to Previous Day</p>
<p>Unified A 60.50 59.90 60.50 Up 0.60</p>
<p>Unified B 52.35 51.80 52.30 Up 0.70</p>
<p>Unified C 50.45 49.65 50.35 Up 0.75</p>
<p>Unified D 48.95 48.20 48.95 Up 0.70</p>
<p>Unified E 50.85 49.80 50.80 Up 0.75</p>
<p>In stock trading, 30 shares of Dasheng No. 1 Factory stock were traded at a price of 16.75 yuan.</p>
<p>Although the New York stock market on Saturday stabilized amid a major decline, the Shanghai stock market opened with a feeling of unease. This is undoubtedly due to the general public's doubts about the future outcome of the large-scale war currently taking place in northern France. However, war is a long-term struggle, so even if there are small setbacks at times, they can only be regarded as temporary reversals and have no fundamental or decisive significance. The biggest reason for the market's weakness is that there was a slight disappointment with news related to the war, and secondly, there was a lack of maintenance ability from the buying side. The prices of various stocks fell sharply yesterday. There was a sign of rebound in the first half hour of the morning, but unfortunately rumors flourished in the afternoon, causing the price to drop again. In order to avoid all sorts of trouble, according to the custom of the London market, after the company has announced dividend distribution, stock bonuses, or other new stocks, all transactions will be traded at a price excluding dividends, rights, or stock bonuses in the same week when the transfer is stopped.</p>
<h3>Three Kinds of Rubber Stocks Distribute Dividends</h3>
<p>The intermediaries of Shengjia De Li, Boheng, and Ketaba Road, three rubber tree companies managed by the British firm Xiangmao Foreign Company, have all announced the regular distribution of interim dividends for the fiscal year ending at the end of June 1940. Shengjia De Li will distribute 3 yuan per share of national currency, and Boheng will distribute 0.3 yuan per share of national currency, both scheduled for distribution starting on June 4th. Ketaba Road will also distribute 0.3 yuan per share of national currency, scheduled for distribution starting on June 12th.</p>
<h3>Food: Hot Weather Makes Rice易 Deteriorate, Sales Fall in Succession</h3>
<p>The rice market still presents a weak color, and the entire city has been consistently sluggish from beginning to end. The early market at the beginning was difficult to grasp due to the one-day closure yesterday, so both buyers and sellers were holding back. There was only slight activity until the middle market, and then news of gold falling and exchange rates rising, as well as the yarn and cotton markets all trending lower, made people even more nervous. The general public was eager to exit the market, and the changes in the market were dramatic. General speculators were also wary of the crisis lurking in the market and did not dare to make a move. Instead, they remained hidden. The whole city's sales area only had scattered spot sales, resulting in few deals and prices only fluctuating by half a yuan.</p>
<p>洋米 was affected by the falling gold and exchange rates. The opening price in the morning gradually trended lower, and the selling pressure was even stronger in the afternoon. Those with floating stockpiles competed to sell first, followed by large households. The downward trend became even stronger. The opening price for Xiaojiao rice in the morning was still 47 yuan, and the noon market closed at 46.4 yuan. The afternoon was shaken by the gold market, once plummeting to 44.5 yuan. The closing market stabilized slightly, and as a result, returned to 45 yuan, a drop of more than 2.5 yuan compared to the closing price last weekend. The noon closing price for other types of rice also decreased by a few cents to a yuan, while the afternoon continued to decrease by one yuan and one and a half yuan. The original package of No. 2 Saigon rice from Yinghua Si dropped 56.4 yuan, also decreasing by 2-3 yuan.</p>
<p>Also, after the local rice in this city was blocked from shipping to Shanghai, the source of supply was cut off, and the price of rice soared accordingly. The foreign rice took the opportunity to become active, and the merchants managing it placed orders with Vietnam and Siam. The number of foreign rice imports has been astonishing in the past two months, and warehouses have even been filled to capacity. In the past two weeks, the import of foreign rice has gradually decreased. The price of foreign rice used to be cheaper than local rice, but now it is equal to or even higher than the price of local rice. This situation is worrisome for civilian livelihoods, and it is hoped that the rice industry will find a way to suppress it and maintain the people's livelihood. It is reported that the Yihua Foreign Company's Taisheng ship shipped 4,461 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong yesterday, docking at the Roosevelt Wharf for unloading. (Zu)</p>
<p>Thick and thin粳 local rice sources continue to be strong, with an estimated arrival of over 3,000 bags, of which Du粳 accounts for two-thirds. As a result, there are rumors that the off-market prices are even cheaper, and the weather is hot and stuffy, people are even more unsettled and are selling at low prices to unload. The making price for open粳 rice has fallen one yuan. Wuxi 清粳 rice is 49 yuan, 纷粳 is 48 yuan, and Changkun粳 is 47 yuan. However, the arrival of thin rice and early rice is relatively rare, depreciating slightly by 3-5 cents. Qing Si special thin is 50 yuan, large market is 48-9 yuan, Nangang early rice special is 47-8 yuan, Jue is 46 yuan, and so on.</p>
<p>Although glutinous rice is a seasonal commodity, the arrival volume is also strong, and it is affected by the off-market 粳 rice, sales are sluggish and prices have dropped one yuan. The opening price of Jinli special is 43.5-43 yuan, Changdan Bai is 42.5 yuan, and the second-best is 40 yuan.</p>
<h3>Flour Mills Reduce Price by Two Cents</h3>
<p>The flour market is sluggish, the transactions on this street are always quiet, and there is no hope for enthusiastic sales to customers. In addition, with the sharp drop in gold prices and the decline in various commodity prices, people's hearts are weak, which is clearly evident. Therefore, the price for No. 2 flour mills has also been reduced to 13.8 yuan, a decrease of 0.2 yuan compared to last week. The price for the old brand of returned flour was opened at 13.85 yuan in the morning, but no one accepted it in the afternoon. Other domestic miscellaneous brands of flour have also been reduced by 0.1 to 0.2 yuan. Transactions for the entire market are estimated to be around 5,000 bags, and the outlook for the market is not optimistic.</p>
<h3>Oil Cakes: Bean Oil Retreats Rapidly, Bean Cakes Remain Supported</h3>
<p>Bean oil is still sluggish, and the market was volatile and chaotic throughout the day. As a result, selling sentiment prevailed, and the market price continued to fall by 4-5 yuan. It is estimated that 300 barrels of Dalian bean oil were opened, and the price fell from 96 yuan to 92 yuan. 50 pieces of Yanqi bean oil were 68 yuan, 90 dan of Dayou factory oil were 69 yuan, and 50 barrels of Runfeng factory oil were 70 yuan. The sales of bean cakes are now on the rise, but they are constrained by the environment, and there is a lack of excitement. In recent days, the Southern China gangs have been watching, but the inland area still has inquiries, so the overall situation can be supported. Yesterday, it is estimated that 3,000 pieces of Dayou Factory Four Brand cakes were sold, with prices ranging from 10.065 yuan to 10.09 yuan, 2,500 pieces of Tongsheng Factory Shenji cakes were sold at 10 yuan to 10.015 yuan, and 500 pieces of Yantai cakes were sold at 10.05 yuan.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Cotton Cloth Market Sentiment Fluctuates; Northern Merchants Aggressively Purchase Eastern Textiles in the Afternoon</h3>
<p>The cloth market opened lower this morning, rebounding slightly in the afternoon. This was likely due to the continued easing of exchange rates, leading to wavering market sentiment. Stockpilers continued to unload their goods, while buyers remained cautious. Later in the day, northern merchants aggressively bought up Eastern textiles (fine cloth), bolstering confidence. Throughout the day, transactions were sporadic. In this street, approximately one hundred and several dozen pieces were traded. Merchants from Zhejiang, Jiangxi, and Guangdong traded nearly a hundred pieces of dyed cloth and coarse cloth, with varying prices. Fine twill cloth fell by about one yuan per piece, while coarse cloth remained stable. Prices for dyed and bleached cloth from various factories also mostly declined. Lun Chang's "Hero" blue cloth was newly priced at sixty-two yuan per piece, a decrease of ten yuan from the original price.</p>
<p>For Eastern-produced white cloth, the leading brand of fine cloth fell from forty-one yuan to thirty-nine yuan at the morning session closing. Market sentiment was weak at the opening of the afternoon session, intensifying the selling pressure. The lowest price plummeted to thirty-seven yuan and two jiao and a half per piece. "Four Gentlemen" serge fell to one yuan, six fen, and a half per yard. Around four o'clock, merchants from Tianjin, Qinhuangdao, and other northern regions suddenly came in strong to buy spot fine cloth, with six to seven hundred pieces changing hands. Local traders also seized the opportunity to buy, causing the market sentiment to shift. The closing price for the leading brand rose to forty yuan and five jiao, and serge to approximately one yuan, one jiao, and three fen. Today (the 21st), the market issued a notice that due to the hot weather, business will be suspended in the afternoon, with only half-day operations.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Hangzhou-Jiaxing Cocoon Market Opens; Wuxi Silkworm Season Looking Good</h3>
<p>The cocoon market in the Hangzhou-Jiaxing area of Zhejiang has already opened, but the supply is limited. Local variety cocoons opened at one hundred and eighty yuan, and Duyang variety cocoons at two hundred and fifty yuan. Based on cost calculations, and due to the high price of fuel and other expenses, new factory silk should be priced above four thousand two hundred yuan per dan. This spring, many silkworm farmers are reeling silk themselves, based on the experience of previous years, as selling cocoons is not very profitable. Currently, white raw silk is priced at one hundred and sixty yuan per hundred taels. Calculated at one thousand six hundred taels, the cost of each dan of Chihli-style white raw silk should be around two thousand six hundred yuan. In general, the cost of silk is very high this year, while the confidence in the overseas market is very uncertain.</p>
<p>In the rural areas of Wuxi, silkworm farming is progressing smoothly. The early batch has already completed its first major molt and started feeding for two days, while the late batch has completed its third molt and started feeding. The price of leaves has recently been eleven to twelve yuan per dan. There has not yet been a significant shortage of mulberry leaves. (Good)</p>
<h3>Japanese Silk Dumps; Local European Sales Quiet; Jardine's Already Unloading New Silk</h3>
<p>Yokohama spot price: 1,530 yuan, down 10 yuan. Near-term: 1,540 yuan, down 30 yuan. Far-term: 1,555 yuan, down 25 yuan.</p>
<p>In the local silk market, Jardine Matheson has already started selling new silk, approximately thirty bales of White Factory silk, graded at 7-8, priced at five thousand and fifty yuan. Transactions of old silk are not frequently seen. Chihli brand is priced at two thousand six hundred yuan, with Da Chang and others purchasing twenty dan. Sales to Europe appear weak in comparison.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Raw White Sugar Softens</h3>
<p>According to a Dutch telegram yesterday, raw white sugar was quoted at US$4.80 per picul, making it increasingly affordable. Coupled with the rise in exchange rates, the market softened. The association's quoted price for spot #24 raw white sugar from foreign warehouses was initially seventy to sixty-nine yuan, then sixty-nine and a half to sixty-nine yuan, down two and a half yuan. Re-export goods were fifty-five yuan, down approximately three yuan. Taikoo Granulated sugar's price decrease was less pronounced; B-mark fell more, to eighty-three yuan. Although domestic sugar merchants tried to maintain their prices, with foreign sugar prices plummeting, they could not maintain their advantage and also appeared quiet.</p>
<h3>Northern and Southern Goods: Southern Goods Scarce</h3>
<p>Southern gorgon nuts are no longer being delivered, and market stocks are almost depleted. As a result, those with any stock are demanding a high price of three hundred yuan. Pond gorgon nuts remain stable, with cleaned goods at eighty yuan and ordinary at seventy-five yuan. It is said that the retail price of Southern gorgon nuts in stores is no less than three yuan.</p>
<h3>Seafood: Sago and Pepper Both See Market Slumps</h3>
<p>Recently, the foreign exchange rate has eased, causing a decline in prices for all imported goods. Currently, both small and large grain sago are selling for ninety yuan, a decrease of ten yuan from before. Black peppercorns are at one hundred and twenty-five yuan, white pepper #1 at two hundred and ten yuan, #2 at one hundred and ninety yuan, and #3 at one hundred and sixty yuan, also down twenty to thirty yuan, with some transactions occurring.</p>
<h3>Metals: "Association Iron" Relies Only on Factory Sales</h3>
<p>Genuine Straits tinplate is currently very scarce, and the quoted prices are extremely firm and expensive. Therefore, most factories are inquiring about "Association Iron" as it is more affordable compared to tinplate. Checks on alternative routes for this product reveal that merchants from North and South China are the primary buyers. However, it is said that demand from these groups has been very low recently, resulting in sluggish sales. As a result, the only outlet for "Association Iron" at the moment is small, local factories. Yesterday's market transactions amounted to approximately three hundred boxes, with prices remaining high. Old steel mill 200-pound standard boxes were selling for two hundred and twenty yuan, while new steel mill boxes were quoted around two hundred yuan.</p>
<h3>Flat-Folded Iron Welcomed by Yangtze River Merchants</h3>
<p>Flat-folded "Association Iron" has only recently entered the market, but has already been well received by various factories. Yesterday, merchants from the Yangtze River area purchased over a hundred boxes for use as canning materials, priced at one hundred and sixty-one yuan per box (equivalent to eighty yuan per two bundles, as two bundles are combined into one box).</p>
<h3>Imports and Exports: Ningbo Goods Arrive in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Yesterday, 1,150 pieces of tin foil, 2,250 pieces of fresh eggs, and 2,000 pieces of ammonia arrived in Shanghai from Ningbo, and transported from Hong Kong.</p>

<h3>Earnest Advice from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce: All Shops Should Suppress Prices, Encouraging Each Other to Sell More at Low Profit and Set Fair Prices; The Two Concessions Are Determined to Suppress Speculation</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce issued a letter to the city's business community regarding the issue of prices, stating, "To all members of the city's business community, during the recent six months, the price of goods has risen beyond normal levels, and the people's livelihood is suffering like never before. At this difficult time, even if we cannot share everything we have with each other or sympathize with each other's difficulties, how can we bear to be the only ones full while others are starving, or to take advantage of the danger for profit? We dare to offer our humble sincerity and do our best to provide loyal advice. The only reason cited for the recent high prices is the rise in the exchange rate between foreign currency and the national currency. It must be understood that the daily needs of the people are mostly produced in China. The fluctuations in the exchange rate do not completely affect the level of costs. Merchants seeking profit should calculate the cost of each item based on the cost of production in its place of origin, the expenses along the way, and the operating expenses of the store, and then set their profit margins.</p>
<p>Prices Follow the Exchange Rate in Reverse</p>
<p>Today, for all goods, regardless of whether they are produced domestically or not, almost all prices fluctuate with gold and foreign exchange. This approach is close to acting in reverse. Furthermore, high exchange rates can only affect goods purchased from abroad that have not yet been priced. Retail stores that have already purchased and have not yet sold out their inventory are not affected at all. Yet, upon hearing news of rising exchange rates in the morning, they immediately raise prices in the evening, echoing the trend. What is their intention? Moreover, when the exchange rate rises, the price of goods rises accordingly, but when the exchange rate falls, the price of goods does not fall accordingly. Some prices, once raised, often increase by several times, while price reductions are extremely small, barely enough to serve as a disguise to avoid criticism. All of these behaviors are heartbreaking.</p>
<p>What Comes Illegitimately Goes Illegitimately: An Ancient Admonition</p>
<p>The nation is facing unprecedented difficulties, and the people are suffering unprecedented displacement. If we take advantage of the opportunity to exploit the flesh and blood of our compatriots to enrich ourselves, how can we be considered among the civilized and descendants of gods? Our association believes that what comes illegitimately goes illegitimately, as the ancient saying goes. Selling more at low profit is the most important principle of doing business. The pricing of daily necessities for the people must be fair. For goods not from abroad, do not use the exchange rate as an excuse. At this time of inconvenient transportation and delayed deliveries, we should carefully observe the needs of supply and demand, and sell as we receive, without hoarding large quantities or refusing to sell. Do not artificially create a fear of shortages with your policies, thinking that great profits are within reach. It must be understood that the current situation in this city, where the people's lives are generally difficult, has aroused the deep concern of the concession authorities. Those who boast that they can take advantage of this ungoverned situation to do as they please will eventually face the ancient saying "invite the ruler into the urn." It is not too late to repent now. We sincerely advise you, and hope you will understand."</p>
<p>The Public Concession's Intentions Are Firm</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession, after the sharp fluctuations in the black market exchange rate several weeks ago, noted that prices in this city had once risen sharply. Now, the exchange rate has eased, and the price of legal tender has rebounded, reaching levels comparable to those before the sharp fluctuations. However, merchants in this city are not seeking to reduce prices, and some stores even show a tendency to continue raising prices. On the 18th, the council sent letters to related commercial organizations, ordering stores to reduce prices. If they continue to charge excessive prices and attempt to undermine the council's measures to improve social living conditions, it will have no choice but to strictly enforce regulations. According to inquiries from reporters at the Dazhong News Agency, unless prices are announced to be falling and the spirit of speculation no longer exists in the market, the concession authorities will take strong and forceful steps.</p>
<p>The Two Concessions Take the Same Steps</p>
<p>The Public Concession Municipal Council is currently studying recent prices and preparing to take legal action against merchants in the city in the near future. It is also learned that the council is working closely with the French Concession Municipal Council, taking the same steps to ensure that these measures are effective. As for the rumors that the French Concession authorities hope that the Public Concession authorities will cooperate in controlling prices and cracking down on speculation, in reality, the Public Concession and French Concession authorities are already cooperating more effectively than before under the most effective conditions. With mutual assistance and cooperation, controlling prices and cracking down on speculation is not just a hope.</p>
<p>A Serious Lesson for Hoarders</p>
<p>Never before have Chinese merchants in this city engaged in speculation as enthusiastically as they do today. They not only buy foreign exchange and foreign stocks, but also hoard American goods. Unexpectedly, the prices of American goods and stocks have continued to plummet, while the exchange rate has risen sharply, adding insult to injury, resulting in multiple losses. Therefore, the magnitude of the losses is unprecedented in Shanghai's history. According to reliable estimates, as of yesterday afternoon, the total losses of major speculative Chinese merchants alone, when converted to legal tender, amounted to over 100 million yuan. Of this, losses in American goods and stocks were over 50 million yuan, and losses in foreign exchange were around 50 million yuan. This does not include other small speculators and those hoarding non-American goods, or those buying non-American stocks.</p>
<p>Speculative Tricks Exhausted; Coal Prices Continue to Fall</p>
<p>In the local coal market, as the price of gold rebounded, speculators were unable to use their tricks. Hoarders rushed to sell, and now is also the slack season for the coal market, with sluggish sales, causing coal prices to continue to fall. Yesterday, the price of coal dust fell by four yuan per ton from one hundred and fifty-two yuan, to one hundred and forty-eight yuan per ton. The price of coal balls also fell by six yuan per ton, from one hundred and forty yuan to one hundred and thirty-four yuan. However, the prices charged by various coal ball retail stores are quite inconsistent, which is contrary to the authorities' fair pricing rules. It is hoped that the retail stores will correct this, voluntarily suppressing prices.</p>
<h3>Gold Plummets Again, Black Market Exchange Rates Continue to Ease, Domestic Bonds Soar, Rising by Seventy to Eighty Cents Yesterday</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the financial market situation in the local black market saw a significant drop in gold prices, once falling to 5,220 yuan, a sharp decline of 645 yuan compared to the closing price last Saturday. However, the closing price was 5,530 yuan, still a decrease of 335 yuan. As for black market exchange rates, they also showed a sharp easing. The spot British pound closed at 4 pence 234375 yesterday, and the spot US dollar also rose to 5.78125 yuan. The black market exchange rate had tightened sharply at the beginning of this month, but after days of easing, the difference is now negligible. Gold prices have also fallen back, exceeding the market price before the rise at the beginning of the month. Therefore, the market prices of all items should fall back accordingly, but due to the profiteering of retail stores, consumers have not yet benefited from it, but this will not last long. In short, the sharp drop in gold and the easing of black market exchange rates undoubtedly strengthened the value of the legal tender. Therefore, domestic bonds soared yesterday, with various unified bonds rising by seventy to eighty cents, while foreign stocks continued to decline.</p>
<p>Reasons for the Easing of Black Market Exchange Rates</p>
<p>The reasons for the sharp drop in gold prices and the easing of black market exchange rates are: (1) In the Sino-Japanese War, the Chinese side has won consecutive victories, and not only is there absolute confidence in the final victory, but the situation for achieving the final victory has been completed. (2) The Japanese side needs legal tender to purchase agricultural products in the occupied areas, and a large amount of black market exchange is also being sold off. (3) Foreign exchange from Southeast Asia, such as the Dutch East Indies, Singapore, and South China, Hong Kong, is flowing into Shanghai in large quantities, fearing control by the authorities. (4) Serious news about the European war is stimulating people to sell. (5) Depositors in Shanghai banks of various countries involved in the European war, as well as banks of a certain European country rumored to be about to join the war, are withdrawing their deposits, and they have to sell off black market exchange to exchange for legal tender to cope with the situation.</p>
<p>National Bond Prices Rise Steadily</p>
<p>Since the frequent victories of the Chinese army in Hubei and Henan, and the Ministry of Finance has paid the principal and interest of the unified public bonds due through the four banks of the Central Bank, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Farmers Bank, confirming that the rumors of suspension of principal and interest payments are false. As a result, the buying interest in national bonds is strong, and prices are rising steadily. Yesterday, the unofficial market closing prices of various unified bonds were: Type A, 60.15 yuan in the morning and 60.50 yuan in the afternoon; Type B, 51.80 yuan in the morning and 52.30 yuan in the afternoon; Type C, 49.80 yuan in the morning and 50.35 yuan in the afternoon; Type D, 48.20 yuan in the morning and 48.95 yuan in the afternoon; Type E, 50.10 yuan in the morning and 50.80 yuan in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Parcel Service to Funing and Other Places Resumes</p>
<p>The post office announced that personal and small parcels and medicine parcels to Funing, Dianhu, Beisha, Yangzhai Town, Goudun Town, and Yukou Town in Jiangsu Province can now be resumed.</p>
<h3>No Withdrawal of British and French Troops, Shanghai Situation Unchanged, European and Asian Transportation May Be Slightly Affected, But Foreign Trade Will Not Be Interrupted</h3>
<p>According to a certain important French figure yesterday, there will be an important turning point in the European situation, but the content cannot be disclosed due to military secrets. Currently, four French veterans, Pétain, Weygand, Gamelin, and Giraud, are involved in military affairs, and the situation should unfold in a week. As for the situation in Shanghai, there is no change, and there is no plan to withdraw any of the British and French troops stationed in Shanghai. French merchant ships are still passing through the Mediterranean as usual, and unless there are special changes, there is no need to change the route. British ships are now detouring around the Cape of Good Hope. The connection between Europe and Asia will inevitably be slightly affected, but it will definitely not be as serious as generally imagined, because the time from the Far East to the United Kingdom via the Mediterranean is 30 days, and detouring around the Cape of Good Hope is only 38 days.</p>
<p>The Gloom in Shanghai is Gradually Clearing</p>
<p>According to a certain British diplomatic source, the recent tension in Shanghai's atmosphere is obviously affected by the expansion of the European war, but it cannot be regarded as a sign of the deterioration of relations between the authorities of various countries in Shanghai. At the beginning of the expansion of the European war, the authorities of the countries concerned had many concerns about whether the situation in Shanghai would change. However, since Admiral Hord, commander of the Asian Fleet, invited the commanders of the defense forces of various countries in China to meet and concluded a certain agreement, the gloom of the deterioration of the situation in Shanghai has gradually cleared, and the future of Shanghai can maintain the status quo.</p>
<p>Sino-Dutch Trade Has Not Been Interrupted</p>
<p>According to a spokesperson for the Dutch Consulate in Shanghai, the Netherlands has been invaded in this European war. The German army concentrated all its forces, used a large number of mechanized units, and had thousands of aircraft to coordinate the attack. The Netherlands has a small land area and a dense population. In order to protect tens of millions of lives and avoid being涂炭, the Dutch commander-in-chief painfully ordered a ceasefire. However, this does not mean complete surrender. There are still a large number of Dutch troops fighting side by side with the Allied forces in France to strive for the final victory, recover the lost land, and regain peace and freedom. There are more than 300 Dutch citizens in Shanghai, all engaged in business. There are only two or three Dutch citizens in the interior of China. Sino-Dutch relations have always been very harmonious, and trade is very developed. Now that the European route of Dutch ships has been suspended, Dutch goods cannot come to Shanghai. However, the Dutch East Indies route is maintained as usual, so trade between the two sides has not been interrupted.</p>
<p>Shanghai-Europe Telegrams are as Numerous as Snowflakes</p>
<p>Since the expansion of the European war, various radio companies have been very busy. It is found that there are currently several wireless telegraph operators in Shanghai, including the British-owned Great Eastern Telegraph Company, the Danish-owned Great Northern Telegraph Company, the American-owned Pacific Commercial Telegraph Company, and the International Wireless Radio Station, which was formerly managed by the Ministry of Communications but is now occupied by the Japanese. Each company receives and sends about eighty telegrams every day, more than thirty telegrams from Berlin, and about forty and thirty telegrams sent to Rome and Berlin, respectively, an increase of five or six times compared to before. This shows the busyness of Shanghai's wireless telegrams to Europe. As for wireless telegrams to the United States, San Francisco is the main destination. Each company sends a total of 150 to 200 telegrams every day, and receives 70 to 80 telegrams.</p>

<h3>US Overseas Trade Week Day Three, Grand Luncheon Held, Secretary of State Hull Broadcast Last Night, Navy Chaplain of the Asian Fleet Speaks</h3>
<p>US Overseas Trade Week began the day before yesterday (the 19th). All American merchants in Shanghai held a special worship service at the Great Light Theater at 10:00 am that day, and Navy Chaplain Dunster of the US Asian Fleet delivered a speech. It is learned that US Secretary of State Hull gave a broadcast speech last night to commemorate the festival, which was rebroadcast to the world by the Treasure Island Radio Station in San Francisco, call sign XGHI, at 10:45 pm last night. Those with shortwave radios in Shanghai can listen to it. The American Chamber of Commerce and the American Association will hold a grand luncheon at the American Club this noon to celebrate.</p>
<p>Dunster's Speech</p>
<p>Navy Chaplain Dunster of the US Asian Fleet gave a speech at the special worship service held by the US Navy for Overseas Trade Week the day before yesterday, stating that all countries in the world should currently devote themselves to a great cause, that is, how to maintain permanent peace in the world. The ultimate goal of all mankind is peace, although this theory seems impossible to realize at present, but we should carefully examine the various conventions and organizations established in history, such as the League of Nations, etc., whose purpose is to make countries have closer relations,</p>
<p>Mutual Assistance and Understanding</p>
<p>and faith. Taking the United States as an example, there are a total of forty-eight states, but they can all unite and be controlled by Washington. The so-called states all have their individual characteristics, but the entire United States still has a common goal and cooperation. Therefore, taking the United States as a symbol, the forty-eight states unite to seek common interests and happiness. The above-mentioned ideal of world peace is by no means completely impossible. If we take the happiness of the whole world as a prerequisite, every country should treat its neighbors with a broader vision, and should abolish racial concepts and believe that every nation should be above another nation. The call of humanitarianism should be the foundation of human life. If we want to maintain the happiness of the world, we must remember what we do not want others to do to us, which is</p>
<p>Golden Rule</p>
<p>The current stage of the war will hardly improve the current situation, but we can adhere to the principle of "do not do to others what you do not want them to do to you." This is especially important in the current situation in Shanghai, because Shanghai is the only international city in the world. The residents of Shanghai include nationals of forty-five different countries. We live in the same place every day, and we should abandon racial prejudice. We must first have this kind of loyalty and treat others with kindness before we can get others to treat us with kindness. To expand it, we must make all mankind become brothers and sisters, and live together under the rule of this golden rule.</p>
<p>Today's Grand Gathering</p>
<p>Also, the US Overseas Trade Week luncheon will be held at the Shanghai Union Club at 12:00 noon today. At that time, US Consul Smith will give a speech. Also, at 12:30 pm on the 23rd, the Rotary Club will hold a luncheon at the Capital Hotel to commemorate Overseas Trade Week. At that time, French Embassy Commercial Counselor セレン司, Canadian Government Commercial Commissioner De 克洛氏, US Consul Smith, etc., will all give speeches on US Trade Week.</p>
<h3>Nanjing Special Party Headquarters Telegraphs Congratulations for the Victory in Hubei and Henan</h3>
<p>The Nanjing Special City Party Headquarters, because of the recent battles in Hubei and Henan, annihilated tens of thousands of enemies, so they telegraphed President Chiang to pay their respects. The original text is as follows: President Chiang, In the Hubei-Henan battles, tens of thousands of enemies were annihilated, and it is hoped that they will be utterly defeated.

Hearing the good news from afar, I admire your great achievements. I hereby telegraph congratulations and pay my respects. The Nanjing Special City Party Headquarters bowed, 巧.</p>
<h3>Ship Schedules of Various Countries Arriving in Shanghai are Temporarily Changed, Regular Mail Ships Cannot Arrive on Time, American Ships are Crowded with Cargo, Import and Export Departures are Behind Schedule</h3>
<p>The expansion of the European war has had a significant impact on the shipping industry. Within the European-Asian route, German and Danish merchant ships have completely suspended operations. Norwegian and Dutch ships are operating under the command of the British Navy. Although Italian ships are not related, they are mostly requisitioned for national defense needs, so the number of ships operating on the Far East route has also decreased. As the United Kingdom and France are belligerent countries, the operation of each ship is particularly cautious and strictly confidential. Regular mail ships cannot arrive on time, and irregular ships are even more inaccurate.</p>
<p>British and French Ships</p>
<p>It is heard that the British ship 巴特凡号 will arrive in Shanghai from London today. A certain French mail ship set sail from Marseille in late last month and is expected to arrive in Shanghai at the end of this month. Another French ship was originally scheduled to set off for China last week, but the city has not yet received a telegram from the ship. Since the outbreak of the European war, the transportation of American ships has suddenly become prosperous. Due to the loading and unloading of cargo, the departure schedules of American President Lines mail ships are often delayed.</p>
<p>American Ship Routes</p>
<p>The passenger ship 搭虎脱 President号 was originally scheduled to come to Shanghai from Little Luzon via Hong Kong tomorrow and return to the United States. It is heard that it will be delayed by one day and will arrive in Shanghai on the 23rd. The company's world-class mail ship 泡克号, which departed from New York, came to China via Japan, and went to Hong Kong and Southeast Asian ports, returning to the United States via Europe, traveling around the world, was originally scheduled to arrive in port tomorrow, but it is now heard that it will arrive early at 2:00 pm today, anchoring at the 11th and 12th net cylinders. The passenger shuttle will depart from the Customs Pier at 2:15 pm today and return to the Customs Pier to land passengers at about 3:45 pm. The 泡克 President号 mail ship is scheduled to leave Shanghai at 8:45 pm tomorrow and go to Hong Kong and Little Luzon. The last shuttle to send passengers will depart from the Customs Pier at 7:15 pm tomorrow.</p>
<p>Java Mail Ship</p>
<p>The Java Company mail ship 芝尼加拿号 should have arrived in Shanghai yesterday according to the scheduled schedule, but due to the German attack on the Netherlands, the ship was ordered to stop in the Philippines, and then it resumed sailing, causing a delay of one day. The exact time of arrival in port today has not yet been announced by the company yesterday. The ship is scheduled to dock at the Puxi blue smoke chimney pier.</p>
<h3>Charity Arts and Crafts Fair Closes Tonight, Yi Fangshuo and Zhang Yezhi Perform Together in an Unprecedented Breakthrough</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Relief of Refugee Children's Education Center, in order to raise funds for expanding production education, specifically organized the "Shanghai Jishan Arts and Crafts Fair" for the 29th year, which has been held at the Gengxin Stage on Niuzhuang Road since its opening on the 14th of this month. Every day, wonderful programs are performed, and enthusiastic people from all walks of life have generously donated and enthusiastically purchased tickets to help the refugees, creating an unprecedented grand occasion. The meeting, in order to thank the enthusiastic people from all walks of life for their kindness, agreed with the person in charge of the Gengxin Stage and continued to perform for two days yesterday and today. Mr. Yuan Ludeng, a social celebrity, obtained the consent of two drama masters, Yi Fangshuo and Zhang Yezhi, to perform together in an unprecedented way. Yesterday, all of "Four Teaching Songs" was sung by Yi Zhang himself, which was quite wonderful, and the audience returned with great pleasure. Today's programs include "Catch and Release Cao", "A Dragon and Phoenix Present Auspiciousness", and "Chain Set". The meeting decided to close at 6:00 pm today.</p>
<h3>Water Company Continues to Provide Free Clean Water</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Water Company, at the request of the Public Works Bureau's Sanitation Department, will continue to provide free tap water to civilians from several taps on the road this year to prevent cholera and emphasize hygiene.</p>
<h3>Another Batch of Japanese Troops Return Silently</h3>
<p>Recently, the Japanese army was defeated once in northern Jiangxi and again in northern Hubei. The number of casualties is shocking. The corpses that have been retrieved are being transported to Shanghai for cremation and placed in boxes, ready to be transported back to Japan in batches for a silent reunion with their relatives and friends. Yesterday was the date for the 42nd memorial service for ashes held by the Japanese in Shanghai. Important Japanese military and political figures and overseas Chinese leaders stationed in Shanghai paid their respects at "Xiben願寺" at 5:00 pm, and a music team played mourning songs. It is scheduled to load the "ash basins" into a certain transport ship on the 23rd and "return silently."</p>
<h3>Two Banks in Shanghai Issue French Military Bonds, French Prime Minister Telegraphed Thanks to the Public Works Bureau for Purchasing Bonds, The Second Charity Lottery Will Be Issued</h3>
<p>The French Public Works Bureau remitted 5 million francs to France the week before last to purchase military bonds. The Prime Minister of the French government, Leno, has now telegraphed the French Consul General to thank the bureau. It is heard that the French Public Works Bureau's purchase of 5 million francs of French military bonds this time is indeed a model role, and it originally wanted to encourage French overseas Chinese in Shanghai to continue to purchase</p>
<p>Bond Nature</p>
<p>According to the French military bonds issued this time, they are short-term debt in nature, and their terms are divided into six months, one year, and two years. In terms of interest, six months is 2.5%, one year is 3%, and two years is 3.5%. This interest can be deducted in advance at the time of purchase. The bonds are now sold by the Banque de l'Indochine and the Sino-French Industrial and Commercial Bank in Shanghai. The face value of the bonds is divided into three types: 500 francs, 1,000 francs, and 10,000 francs.</p>
<p>Charity Lottery</p>
<p>The French charity lottery company for the relief of refugees in Shanghai recently plans to issue the second lottery. However, the funds obtained from this lottery are not exclusively for the use of refugees, but to assist charitable causes in France and China. It is learned that the second lottery will sell for one yuan per full ticket, and 220,000 tickets will be issued in each issue. However, only 200,000 tickets will be sold, and the remaining 20,000 tickets will be used as gifts to encourage ticket buyers. The second lottery is divided into first prize and sixth and seventh prizes. The fixed amount of the first prize is 50,000 yuan, but if the ticket cannot be sold well, it will be reduced to 25,000 yuan, and the other prizes will also be reduced accordingly.</p>
<h3>Sino-Western Flower Show Spring Annual Meeting Held Tomorrow</h3>
<p>The Sino-Western Flower Show Spring Annual Meeting, unaffected by the European war, will be held at the Racecourse tomorrow (Wednesday) from 12:00 noon to 7:00 pm, and on Thursday from 10:00 am to 7:00 pm. At this time of splendid spring flowers, the results are very impressive. Tickets are one yuan for adults and five cents for children, and there is no price increase (students led by teachers are only charged two cents per person). On the Chinese member side, it is heard that Mr. Zhou Shoujuan, who won the Sir Peter Grand Silver Cup Championship Award at the last autumn annual meeting, will still participate. In addition to more than 20 small and medium-sized potted plants, there will also be a "Eight Treasures Feast", which is to display eight kinds of flowers and trees in eight kinds of bonsai made of jade, stone, porcelain, copper, bamboo, wood, brick, and sand, which are ancient and unique. In addition, bonsai expert Kong Zhiqing also has more than 30 pieces of water stones and potted plants on display, all of which are fine products.</p>
<h3>Ningbo Gazette Issues Second Anniversary Album</h3>
<p>Since the Shanghai Ningbo Gazette was published in Sichuan, it has been two years. The newspaper aims to convey Ningbo local news, so it has won the love of 700,000 Ningbo natives in Shanghai. The daily sales volume exceeds 15,000 copies. In order to commemorate the second anniversary of its publication, the newspaper has specially printed a commemorative special issue. The text of the publication is written by local officials, fellow villagers, celebrities, and experts familiar with Ningbo's political situation, customs, and human feelings, totaling more than 100,000 words.

All those who subscribe to the newspaper this month will receive a free copy. The address of the newspaper is at the intersection of Guizhou Road and Beijing Road, telephone number 93619.</p>
<h3>Ningbo Import and Export Goods Will Be Levied a Relief Fee Starting Yesterday, 5% of the Customs Estimated Value Will Be Collected, All Goods Stored in Warehouses Will Be Collected</h3>
<p>The Ningbo People's Food Relief Committee announced the method of raising funds for the poor people's food relief fee, which will be implemented from May 20. The original text of the method is as follows: Article 1, all kinds of goods entering and leaving Ningbo port, and imported goods not yet withdrawn from the warehouse (regardless of whether they are shipped by steamer or folk boat) must be raised in accordance with the provisions of this method. Article 2, the relief fee raised shall be 5% of the recent estimated value of import and export goods by the Customs, but if any underreporting or cheating is found, the raising office may investigate the market price and freely estimate it.</p>

<h3>Lin Yutang Takes a Short Break in Hong Kong, Chooses a Place to Engage in Writing; Lin Says that During the War of Resistance, One Should Sacrifice One's Spirit; Americans Believe Japan Has Absolutely No Hope of Success</h3>
<p>After arriving in Hong Kong on the 10th of this month from the United States, the famous writer Lin Yutang resided in Kowloon. He then declined social engagements due to suffering from gout and recuperated. The Hong Kong Chinese Cultural Advancement Association, the Chinese Literary Association, and the Sino-British Cultural Association, among other groups, originally planned to hold a meeting to welcome Lin. They also designated preparatory personnel, and Professor Xu Dishan of the University of Hong Kong was sent to meet with Lin to convey the welcome from various cultural groups. Lin initially agreed, but the next morning, he suddenly notified Xu, saying that he would not accept the welcome from the groups, politely declining with utmost humility.</p>
<p>Lin's Clansmen Offer a Warm Welcome</p>
<p>Yutang's return to the country via Hong Kong this time was warmly welcomed by the people, especially the Lin clan, who showed even more enthusiasm. They believed that Lin's international fame brought honor to the country and illuminated the ancestors. Therefore, the Hong Kong Lin Xihe Hall Clan Association also prepared to hold a meeting to welcome him. At that time, Lin Ci Ming, Lin Yaohuan, and others were designated to be responsible for the preparations, but as a result of not being able to meet with Lin, it could not be held as scheduled.</p>
<p>Reporters Arrange an Interview, Enjoy a Happy Gathering</p>
<p>On the 14th of this month, reporters from various Hong Kong newspapers specially invited Lin to meet and talk at the Weishimen Restaurant. Lin arrived on time. After taking his seat, he first said that when talking to everyone, there should be no formality, and opinions should be exchanged casually. The reporters then inquired about his future plans for his writing career, the general opinion in the United States regarding the Sino-Japanese War, and the attitude of the United States and Japan towards the Dutch East Indies, among other issues. Lin gave detailed answers to all the questions asked above. As for explaining that he would devote himself to writing in the future and had no intention of entering politics, his words were extremely humorous. The following is a record of Lin's remarks, divided into sections:</p>
<p>Traveling to Chongqing, No Intention of Taking Office</p>
<p>Lin will go to Chongqing within a week or two, then travel to various places to observe the general situation in the country during the War of Resistance. After that, he will choose a place with convenient transportation to reside for a long time and continue his writing work. He said that this is the true nature of a scholar, and he has no intention of entering the political arena. Lin believes that being an official requires unique talents, which is completely different from being a scholar. Although Bai Juyi, Su Dongpo, Yuan Zicai, and others had all entered officialdom, they eventually resigned and left. However, there are also those who can both write and handle affairs, such as Zeng Guofan. When asked about his future writing plans, he replied that he has not yet decided to write major articles discussing politics, but he will continue to write within the scope of what is possible. Lin further explained in detail that during the War of Resistance, the people should sacrifice their personal freedom for the future of the country, and the control of public opinion is indeed necessary. All countries also implement it during wartime, but the question is how to implement it. For example, during the era of the Northern Warlords, Mr. Wu Zhihui wrote an article denouncing Cao Kun's favorite servant, Li Yanqing, and was even accused of insulting the Republic of China, which is truly the greatest joke.</p>
<p>The United States Is Extremely Optimistic About China</p>
<p>Continuing to talk about the opinion in the United States regarding the Sino-Japanese War, he said that after Guangzhou and Hankou fell in the previous year, the American public was extremely anxious about China's future. The famous American commentator Walter Lippmann, whose commentary is supplied to more than a hundred newspapers, has considerable potential influence. He once made this argument, but he is a specialist in European issues, and he believes that he is inevitably isolated from the situation in the Far East, so he made this conclusion. In the following year, the Japanese military in China made no progress, and news from foreign news agencies in Tokyo constantly reported rice shortages, coal shortages, electricity shortages, and labor shortages in Japan, believing that Japan's national strength was on the verge of exhaustion. They attached particular importance to the turmoil in the Japanese parliament last year, namely the Saito Takao失言 incident. They believed that the questions raised by Saito were what the Japanese people urgently wanted to know, and that he dared to raise them frankly, so one could imagine how激昂 the people's emotions of dissatisfaction with the government and opposition to the war were. Later, Japan invaded Bingyang and used the excuse of not wanting to extend the battle line, and retreated a little from 　後. The general American opinion was that Japan's aggressive power had reached its limit. On the other hand, in view of China's continued firm resistance, and those who returned from observing the interior praised China's progress, the American opinion changed from anxiety to optimism. In the past two or three months, they have all believed that Japan has absolutely no hope of success.</p>
<p>Severely Criticizing the Puppet Organizations</p>
<p>The establishment of the "Nanjing Organization" is not taken seriously by the American people. Although the Japanese side has been constantly promoting it for a year, those who are short-sighted may be deceived and think that it represents the "peace faction" in China. However, all those who are knowledgeable and thoughtful think that it has no value at all. Secondly, when commentators from various American newspapers gather, I also participate. When discussing the puppet organizations, they述 the relationship between the various puppet organizations and their internal affairs in great detail. I am still ashamed to be inferior. The American newspapers' tone towards the puppet organizations is quite刻薄. Lin explained that the Americans' sympathy for China is because Japan's invasion of China this time is very clear, unlike when I was in England during the September 18th Incident. At that time, the general public was misled by the Japanese propaganda and thought that Japan's investment in the three northeastern provinces had been infringed upon, so it was excusable to use force to seize it.</p>
<p>Japan Does Not Dare to Act Rashly Towards the Dutch East Indies</p>
<p>Regarding Japan's attitude towards the Dutch East Indies, according to Lin's opinion, the key lies in the United States. If the United States expresses its firm attitude, then Japan will definitely not dare to act rashly. When asked what the United States would do if Japan ignored everything and invaded the Dutch East Indies, it is predicted that the United States' economic sanctions against Japan would be implemented more severely to促 Japan to awaken. If the situation cannot be improved in two or three years, then the Pacific War will 　至break out.</p>
<p>Americans Admire Chinese Philosophy</p>
<p>Finally, he talked about his own writings in the United States and related issues such as publishing. He expanded on the various books he wrote in the United States, with "The Art of Living" being the best-selling. In addition to the above books, there is a book called "The History of Chinese News and Public Opinion," which mostly introduces Chinese academic thought and life philosophy, so that foreigners can have a deep understanding of Chinese history. The recently popular "Confucius Says" movement in the United States is to cater to the curiosity of Americans. For example, radio broadcasting and newspaper advertisements all use "Confucius Says" as a slogan. Small booklets are sold on the market with the title "Confucius Says" on the cover, but when examined, the content is mostly American slang or even low-level趣味文字. However, the general American public admires Chinese philosophy very much, and even associates Chinese old people with 　deep knowledge of the world and a thorough understanding of the philosophy of life. The conversation did not end until half past four. Lin wore a gray silk long gown, looking very潇洒, and his attitude during the conversation was also very sincere. He held a pipe in his mouth and never let go of it. Lin praised the ability of tobacco to help 清談 in his article "The Art of Living." Now that Lin has had a long talk for an hour and a half, is this also thanks to tobacco?</p>
<h3>Reiss &amp; Co. Sued for Violating Commercial Agreements; European Situation Tense, Goods and Passengers Cannot Reach Shanghai; Defendant Presents Evidence Claiming No Violation; Case Requires Review of Evidence, Rescheduled for Hearing</h3>
<p>Since Germany began its armed aggression, Britain and France declared war on Germany in September of last year, thus launching the Second World War in Europe. Up until the present time, the war has expanded, causing not only great suffering to the people of the belligerent countries, but also great damage to their commerce. German trade with the Far East has been even more severely affected. This is because German goods shipped to Shanghai must pass through British territorial waters, and the British naval and land forces at Singapore and Hong Kong ports inspect mail and ships with extreme strictness. Once enemy reports or telegrams about shipping goods to Shanghai are discovered, they are immediately seized. At the same time, based on this information, their fleet patrolling the sea is notified to earnestly search. If German ships or goods are encountered, they are</p>
<p>Generally seized and handed over to the enemy goods custody agencies in those places for disposal. With such strict precautions, it is rare for anything to slip through. Even if something occasionally manages to escape and is transported to Shanghai, it is often seized by the HSBC 　 British Bank, which handles the negotiation of documents. Therefore, since last winter, almost no goods have reached the hands of German merchants in Shanghai. However, various German products that they had sold to Chinese merchants before the outbreak of the European war could not be delivered on time, which greatly criticized those who placed orders. At first, they asked the other party to extend the deadline, but recently, with the value of imported goods rising, and</p>
<p>The European war is in full swing, and the general customers can not be fooled with empty words. As a result, disputes arose between the buyers and sellers, especially for Reiss &amp; Co., which had many order disputes. Three lawsuits were filed against the company by customers in the First Special District Court for breach of contract and demanding compensation for losses. This morning, three summonses were issued: (1) Huacheng Iron Printing and Can Making Factory, (2) Taikang Canned Food Company, (3) Chen Jimao. The goods ordered by the above three customers were all Italian-produced lead skin (父名tinplate), with a quantity of 250 boxes each, and a fixed price of one pound and nineteen shillings in British currency per box. The company only</p>
<p>One batch was shipped and distributed to the three customers, still owing 155 boxes to each customer. Currently, the market price of this product is more than two pounds per box. Therefore, each plaintiff unanimously requested that Reiss &amp; Co. be ordered to deliver the ordered goods according to the contract, or to compensate for the losses according to the current selling price. However, because Taikang and others believed that the other party had violated the contract, they requested legal protection, but they tried to be cunning with the litigation costs they should pay. They calculated the amount of the currency based on the statutory exchange rate of the British gold goods price and paid the litigation costs according to this amount. This morning, the presiding judge, Li Hu, exposed the plaintiff's attempt to take advantage of the court. He then announced the provisions of Article 404 of the Civil Procedure Law regarding the payment of litigation costs, stating that according to the law, 　 the litigation costs should be paid based on the market price of the</p>
<p>Goods in dispute at the time of the lawsuit. It was found that on the day Huacheng and Taikang filed the lawsuit, the market price of tinplate was 250 yuan per box in currency, and the tariff of 12 yuan per box should be deducted, so the market price was reduced to 230 yuan per box. The amount sued for was 155 boxes, with a total value of 35,650 yuan in currency. The litigation costs to be paid should be 507 yuan, 3 jiao, 7 fen, and 5 li. In addition to the 166 yuan and 5 jiao already paid, 340 yuan, 8 jiao, 7 fen, and 5 li should be paid. However, on the day Chen Jimao filed the lawsuit, the market price of the goods was 200 yuan per box, and 232 yuan and 5 jiao should also be paid. The plaintiffs</p>
<p>After hearing the announcement, they successively expressed their willingness to comply immediately and requested that the trial continue. Then, the lawyer representing the plaintiff stated that the true reason for the defendant's breach of contract was not that the goods could not be shipped to Shanghai, but that the defendant sold the arrived goods after the price of the goods skyrocketed, and then made the excuse that the goods were intercepted in transit. The defendant's lawyer, on the other hand, argued that only one batch of the goods had indeed述 arrived, and the second batch of goods was guaranteed by HSBC to be sold to the Polish-owned Lianyiyang Line. All the goods after that were intercepted by the British</p>
<p>Along the way, which was an event of force majeure. The contract had stated that if it occurred, the defendant would not be responsible. Therefore, the defendant was not at fault for the breach of contract, nor could it be held responsible for compensating for the losses. He also submitted a certificate signed by the German Embassy in China stating that German goods could not be shipped to Shanghai since the outbreak of the European war. The court then learned that Reiss &amp; Co.'s goods were not directly purchased from the manufacturing Italian factory, but were ordered from the British Brock Company. It then summoned the Polish representative of Brock in Shanghai, Pan Erzhi</p>
<p>To the court to investigate the reasons for Reiss &amp; Co.'s failure to deliver the goods. Pan generally attributed it to the war between Britain and Germany, stating that British citizens should not have dealings with Germany. At this point in the trial, because the documents and evidence submitted by the defendant were numerous, and the plaintiff's side could not review them immediately, the trial was adjourned. The plaintiff's lawyer was instructed to schedule a date to go to the court to review the files, and then the trial would continue.</p>
<h3>Xi Shaofen and Feng Ruizhang Accused of Fraud</h3>
<p>Xi Shaofen, a woman from Nanhui, is 28 years old this year. She used to be a clerk in the Lianglu Bureau and has not yet married. She lives with her mother and younger brother at No. 15, Lane 245, Route Paulun. On March 10th of this year, she filed a complaint with the French Concession Police against Chen Zongtao, a young man from Guangdong (residing at No. 310, Route Cardinal Mercier), for issuing bad checks. As a result, the Second District Court sentenced Chen to a fine of 600 yuan. Afterwards, Chen claimed that the checks had been swindled by Feng Ruizhang, a classmate at the law school, and that there was a note from Feng to prove it. Therefore,</p>
<p>Unwilling to accept this, he hired two lawyers, Xu Wufang and Lu Ronggan, to file a private prosecution with the Second District Court against Feng Ruizhang and Xi Shaofen for joint fraud. The court, according to the complaint, held a hearing in the Second Criminal Court a few days ago, presided over by Judge Li. The plaintiff was absent due to illness and was represented by lawyer Xu Wufang. The details were stated briefly as follows: In the bad check case, the defendant Xi Shaofen claimed that she had given the plaintiff 28,000 yuan in cash in November of last year, requesting the court to investigate the source of this huge amount of money.</p>
<p>Whereabouts The defendant Feng Ruizhang was absent for fear of punishment. Only Ms. Xi and her lawyer appeared in court. The court immediately questioned the source of the funds. Ms. Xi defended herself, claiming that 15,000 yuan of it was a check dated November 20 from Jincheng Bank, borrowed from Zhang Bin, who works in the Ministry of Railways, and presented a receipt from Feng. The remaining 13,000 yuan was cash from the sale of land in Pudong. At this point, the plaintiff's lawyer expressed his opinion to the court, saying that the defendant claimed in the previous case that the payment date was November 11, and that all the payments were in cash. Now she suddenly claims that it was a check, and that it was Zhang Bin's money, but the receipt was issued by Feng.</p>
<p>This is very contradictory. Moreover, the defendant is not a bank, so where would she get so much cash? Furthermore, Pudong is an occupied area, and there would be no large real estate transactions. Even if there was cash, it would not be kept at home. He requested that the court strictly arrest Feng Ruizhang so that the truth could be revealed. After verifying the statements, the court instructed Ms. Xi to post bail and wait for an investigation into Zhang Bin's funds at Jincheng Bank 　訊</p>
<h3>A Robbery Occurs in Hamilton House</h3>
<p>At around 3:00 PM yesterday, a robbery occurred in Hamilton House on Jiangxi Road in the Public Concession. According to reporters, the office of No. 312 in the building is Huafeng 洋行. At 3:00 PM yesterday, five robbers suddenly came, three robbers were wearing suits, and two robbers were wearing Chinese clothes. They knocked on the door and entered. The employees of the 　洋行 thought it was a customer coming to斗, so they were warmly welcomed. To their surprise, two robbers each took out a pistol and threatened the employees, scaring them into not making a sound. They also forced them to hand over their valuables. The employees of the 　洋行 told the robbers, "There is no cash." The robbers then forced them to sign a bank check for 9,000 yuan in national currency. One robber took the check to a bank to cash it, while the rest of the robbers stayed in the room to monitor everyone's movements. When the robber who took the money returned, all the robbers left and disappeared without a trace. Afterwards, the 　洋行 reported to the police station and requested an investigation.</p>
<h3>The Mystery of Zhou Junchang's Kidnapping; Zhou Is Not Wealthy, Possibly a Case of Mistaken Identity</h3>
<p>Regarding the kidnapping of Dr. Zhou Junchang, the reason for his kidnapping has not yet been determined. If it were for political reasons, Zhou Junchang is committed to practicing medicine as his career and has never participated in politics. Even his younger brother, Zhou Junmei, although he is an economic committee member, has nothing to do with his brother. 　何 　 Zhou Junmei's political position is also insignificant. If it were because of his wealth, although there are wealthy merchants in the Zhou clan, Zhou Junchang makes a living by practicing medicine, and his family is not inherently wealthy, and he bears a very heavy burden. His elder brother passed away, and he is responsible for the upbringing of his children and nephews. He often provides free treatment to the poor and sick, and never haggles over the rewards from the patients. Therefore, for what reason he was kidnapped this time is suspected to be a misunderstanding. Zhou Junchang is weak, so he rides horses to strengthen his muscles and bones. It is believed that he often gallops on the roads west of Shanghai, so he is mistaken for a member of the leisure class and kidnapped. It is also possible. Zhou still has a mother over eighty years old at home, who cries day and night upon hearing that her son has been kidnapped. His wife is running around, but the reason for the kidnapping is still unclear, so it is impossible to rescue him.</p>
<h3>Kidnapping on Route Kahnert; One Japanese and One Chinese Abducted; Kidnappers Resemble Puppet Police</h3>
<p>The English-language "North China Daily News" stated that on the afternoon of the 18th of this month, a kidnapping occurred on Route Kahnert. At the same time, near the scene of the kidnapping, a rickshaw puller and a person dressed as a farmer were arguing with each other to attract the attention of pedestrians so that the kidnappers would not attract attention. A German resident living on Route Kahnert had a view from outside the door and witnessed the incident. According to him, he saw several people in uniform, resembling "大道" policemen, escorting a Chinese and a Japanese man, both with their hands cuffed, from a building across the road into a taxi beside the road, and drove towards the Joffre district. As soon as the car drove off, the argument between the rickshaw puller and the person dressed as a farmer also ended. However, he did not recognize the taxi's license plate number, but only saw the white license plate hanging on the taxi.</p>

<h3>Goat Hair</h3>
<p>There are a total of 489 trillion to 600 trillion sheep on the earth. Every year, 639 trillion pounds of wool can be sheared, worth 120 trillion taels of silver. The sheep in Manchuria and Mongolia, China, are rarely considered for their wool, so they are probably not included in the statistics. I believe that China should pay attention to this and use it to weave woolens and other items, which may also be a way to enrich the country.</p>
<h3>Poisoned Sea Fish</h3>
<p>A poisonous gas suddenly appeared in the sea in the northeastern United States, killing all the fish and turtles. Fishing boats went out to sea to fish and found that there were 450 li of dead fish corpses. When alive fish captured beyond the boundary were released into the sea within the boundary, they all died instantly. This is truly an unprecedented wonder since the beginning of time, and it will be another test for 格致家.</p>
<h3>Regulations for 馬</h3>
<p>There are often disturbances caused by 野鷄馬車 in the British and French Concessions. Therefore, British patrol head Ping Fuli yesterday ordered Bao Tan to inform various carriage companies that the coachmen pulling the reins are not allowed to sit behind the passengers and let the passengers pull the reins. If a passenger claims to be proficient, the coachman should still sit with him. If he does not follow the instructions or causes trouble, the coachman will be held responsible.</p>

<h3>Where Are You Going? (3)</h3>
<p>One day, I was walking by the river. At that time, it was the peak of the flood, and the rapid current formed whirlpools. In the middle of the 数满, there were many firewood and grass, following the water whirlpools. They had no destination, so they would never reach any place. There are many people like this in the world. They work tirelessly, but when asked where they are going, their only answer is that they have nowhere to go. Their true feelings are disturbed and driven by forces beyond their control, and they can never find peace. The current of life rushes forward, signing them in the whirlpools, blindly swirling. Their lives, therefore, become part of the苦役 and cannot find a way out. This is very sad. The second time I was walking by the river, I saw many large logs floating downstream. If the water was rapid and shallow, the logs would often rub against the rocks. If the water was deep and slow, the logs would move forward very calmly. I therefore thought that it is easy for a person to go with the flow and be the same as everyone else. This can be said to be in line with the times, but it cannot be said to be surpassing the times. The interests of the masses are always downward. The third time I was walking by the river, what I saw was different from the previous two times, and it was even more exciting. The situation was like this: there were many sailing boats in the river, and because the current was too rapid, they all anchored on the shore. Two hours past noon, a wind rose in the sky. Although the wind was not very顺, the boat owners still raised their sails, using the wind slantingly, and 行舟 the goods to the destination upstream. They did not drift with the water, nor did they change the course of their lives with the wind. Their ambition is upright and worthy of our admiration. "Where are you going?" May all of you 行 water upwards, take on the burden of life, and strive towards your established goals! Emulate the boat owners and use the headwinds to seek progress. This road is narrow and difficult, but it is indeed reliable. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Amidst the Escalating War, the Culture of Three European Capitals: Paris, Known as the World's Cultural Center (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Shi Tao</p>
<p>France has always considered itself the world's cultural center and the motherland of art. What has become of this cultural center in wartime? To discuss this, we must first remember that it has already sent six million men to the battlefield. All men capable of social activity have been mobilized. The collective strength of the entire French nation is now focused on the single, supreme goal of national defense. Therefore, today's cultural life in France—that is, the cultural orientation of the French people—absolutely cannot deviate from the nation's collective will: "We must win the war."</p>
<p>Total Mobilization of the Academic World</p>
<p>All learning is being mobilized for the purpose of waging war. France had already prepared a system for the total mobilization of academics before the war. People with outstanding talents are all serving in appropriate positions. This intellectual mobilization has achieved considerable success in France today. All scholars are now directly or indirectly participating in the scientific front. Doctors and pharmacists are wearing military uniforms and acting according to government orders. Specialized technicians are either assigned to military supply factories or are responsible for important guidance in wartime economy. Even free writers are in the same state. For example, the writer Jean Giraudoux has been appointed as an important minister in the information department. He is now gathering old friends from the literary world and journalists to handle the tasks of reviewing domestic and foreign intelligence and propaganda. Another example is Mr. Biraud, the former ambassador to Japan, who is now the director of the Far East Department of the Information Ministry. He has mobilized a large number of French experts on the Far East to handle propaganda and review intelligence related to the Far East.</p>
<p>Tranquil Artists</p>
<p>Since the beginning of the war, there have been no noteworthy developments in the French literary and artistic scene, and no outstanding works have been produced. War literature from the previous World War only appeared several years after the war. Therefore, France will certainly not suddenly produce new literature at this early stage of the war. The Salon exhibition is being held as usual, but almost all the works are from before the war. Only a portrait of former Prime Minister Daladier and some sketches of the front lines by painters on the battlefield are the few exceptional highlights of this year's event. Also, due to the extreme shortage of oil painting materials, the exhibits in the art exhibition are all small-scale pieces. In short, today's French philosophers, writers, artists, technicians, etc., are all protected inside the Maginot Line, without the worry of being disturbed by the sound of cannons. They are either immersed in tranquil contemplation or buried in the study of practical arts and other fields.</p>
<p>Reading Fever Under Air Raids</p>
<p>The issue of national education during wartime is prone to becoming barren. At the outbreak of the war, the National Library of France, known as a world treasure for its collection, as well as the municipal libraries in various districts of Paris, were all closed. This year, in view of the stalemate in the war, they have gradually reopened. As a result, Parisian citizens are still able to satisfy their desire to read during wartime. However, Paris is still under constant threat of air raids, so the number of books that can be borrowed has to be limited. When an air raid siren sounds, everyone grabs their books and flees to the basement. In this tense atmosphere, we can still easily see many crowds lined up every morning waiting for the library to open. The Parisian citizens' passion for reading can be imagined from this.</p>

<h3>Moth</h3>
<p>— Bei Ji</p>
<p>A moth flew in from the dark window, flying, gradually approaching a dim oil lamp. The dancing flame and the shining light—a bright temptation—this small and brave insect endlessly circled towards the source of light, lunging forward...</p>
<p>My soul was stirred by a new consciousness. Did this little creature not come from a dark, damp corner?</p>
<p>I suddenly smelled a scorched odor. A wisp of smoke ended this little warrior's quest for light.</p>
<p>I was moved to tears. I prayed, and I vowed that it was time for me to escape hell.</p>
<p>I extended my hopeful hand: a quest for light!</p>
<h3>Tragic Fishing</h3>
<p>— Ma Ge</p>
<p>Anecdote</p>
<h3>The Little Girl Who Petitioned Roosevelt</h3>
<p>— Wen He</p>
<p>This happened around Christmas last year.</p>
<p>Sandra Grande is an American little girl, living in Newark, New Jersey, with thick golden braids. Before Christmas, she spent half an afternoon writing many Christmas cards. After writing them, she naturally wanted to mail them. But her parents didn't agree. Because the nearest mailbox from their house was across three busy streets. Of course, her parents were worried about a child crossing the streets alone, but they didn't have time to accompany her. Grande was unhappy.</p>
<p>Her father, being a bit stubborn, said: "If you want to mail the letters yourself, you should petition President Roosevelt."</p>
<p>Her father was joking with her, but after Christmas, she actually wrote a letter to the President, which said:</p>
<p>"Dear Mr. President—I know you and the Postmaster General are good friends. I am now asking you to do me a favor. Please tell him to install a mailbox on my street. Because I have to walk a long way to mail letters now, and the road is very dangerous. If he is willing to listen to you, I will be very happy to write you another letter from that mailbox to thank you.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Sandra Grande</p>
<p>P.S.: I am only seven years old this year."</p>
<p>After the letter was sent, it is unknown whether Roosevelt read it. But in a democratic country, the government should consider any reasonable request from the people. So, even though Grande was only seven years old, her request actually had an effect.</p>
<p>On the telegraph pole across from Grande's house, someone actually installed a brand new mailbox! Although the mailbox was installed a bit too high, and she still had to cross the street to reach it, Grande's mother was so happy that she finally let Grande mail the letters herself this time. Her mother watched out for cars as she ran over with an empty wooden box. Standing on the wooden box, she proudly mailed her second letter to President Roosevelt.</p>

<h3>Honorable Children</h3>
<p>— Mo Zi</p>
<p>Every afternoon, many children who come to attend the short-term refugee classes gather at the school gate, waiting for the regular students to be dismissed after four o'clock before rushing into the classroom to receive their rare two hours of education.</p>
<p>Although their clothes are old and tattered, and they don't have fancy schoolbags to hold their books, they carry a few thin books in their two dark little hands. However, looking at their reverent expressions, single-mindedly waiting for the opening of the "door of knowledge," there is such a deep yearning contained in those silent eyes! Every day, I silently watch them, watch their thin but lovely faces. Although I am very unfamiliar with them, my heart is beating with gratitude, and my nerves are also moved to heat. From them, I see the shadow of the growth of the new China, and I can't help but silently recite: Honorable children!</p>
<p>However, seeing them standing outside the fence, gazing at the children playing happily on the playground inside, and constantly showing tense expressions, concerned about the gains and losses of the ball and the ground inside, sometimes even dancing with joy, my heart can't help but feel a slight melancholy. The children playing with balls and rolling hoops on the playground are happy, but the joy on the faces of the children outside the playground indicates that the ball is also jumping in their hearts, and the hoop is also rolling in their hearts. At first, I thought that perhaps they had just come out of small factories, or had just helped their mothers paste some small handicrafts, and were now able to be so happy, after all, they were ignorant children. But later, I deeply condemned myself. A child's innocence and liveliness are precisely the source of their life. Even in the midst of great hardship, this warm and lovely heart should be highly respected. I really want to say to them earnestly: Children! Forget your suffering in this short time, keep this pure and warm heart, and you will grow up from suffering!</p>

<h3>Comments on the Styles of Hollywood Directors</h3>
<p>— Xian De</p>
<p>A film critic for The New York Times once said: The director is responsible for two-thirds of the success or failure of a film, and the remaining one-third is the responsibility of the actors or others. Indeed, even with a good script and good actors, without a good director, the entire film can fall into a terrible result. Conversely, an ordinary script and ordinary actors can also achieve success if handled properly by the director. Therefore, we need to pay more attention to directors.</p>
<p>The following twelve directors are some of the famous directors in Hollywood. Based on my personal opinion, I will make a brief comment below:</p>
<p>(1) John M. Stahl: He is currently one of the "six best directors" and also the highest-paid director. His style is exquisite and delicate, and he excels at directing family dramas. "Imitation of Life" can be considered his representative work.</p>
<p>(2) Cecil B. DeMille: His characteristics are grandeur, detail, and speed. He is powerful in handling large scenes. His representative work is "The Iron Horse."</p>
<p>(3) Michael Curtiz: He specializes in handling historical films and "Four Daughters" type films. The widely praised "Robin Hood" and "Four Daughters" are his representative works.</p>
<p>(4) Ernst Lubitsch: He is known for handling comedies. His works are small but exquisite. "Ninotchka" is his representative work.</p>
<p>(5) William Dieterle: He is a director with a sense of justice. He specializes in directing historical and legendary films. His works are full of anti-dictatorship, justice, and sympathy for oppressed nations. His representative works are "Juarez" and "The Story of Louis Pasteur."</p>
<p>(6) William Keighley: People in Hollywood call him "G-Man Keighley." From this, it can be seen that he is suitable for directing G-Man films. His style is concise and free from the disadvantage of being "long-winded." Many of James Cagney's films were directed by him.</p>
<p>(7) Hitchcock: His style is magnificent, and he has a good understanding of handling mystery and horror films.</p>
<p>(8) Irving Cummings: His style is light and smooth, and he is good at musical films. His representative work is "Alexander's Ragtime Band."</p>
<p>(9) Howard Hawks: His characteristic is that there is more action than dialogue, so he is quite popular with people who do not understand English. "Scarface" can be considered his representative work.</p>
<p>(10) John Ford: His style is characterized by grandeur. His representative work is "The Informer." He has won the Academy Award for Best Director.</p>
<p>(11) Henry Koster's works are light, smooth, delicate, and appropriate. All of Deanna Durbin's films except "Three Smart Girls" were directed by him.</p>
<p>(12) The Whelam: He has a good understanding of comedy. His representative work is "The Perfect Strangers."</p>
<h3>The Drama Society Receives a Drama Award - International Performance to be Held on the 22nd</h3>
<p>The International Charity Performance hosted by the wives of the British and French ambassadors has decided to invite the Shanghai Drama Society to perform "Wu Zetian." Two preview performances were held half a month ago. The British and French embassies sent people to watch and were satisfied. Therefore, it was decided to hold the official performance on the evening of the 22nd. The tickets, priced at ten yuan each, have been sold out by the British and French embassies. The Shanghai Drama Society attaches great importance to this international performance, so all the best actors have been cast in one play. There will also be a grand program that evening. Awards for foreign drama, literature, or film are common, but they do not exist in China. The drama group of the Sino-French Friendship Association will award the Shanghai Drama Society a prize of one thousand yuan on the evening of the 22nd to encourage their work over the past year, and there will be five honorary certificates for the best actors. The wives of the British and French ambassadors will be responsible for giving the awards. Such a grand program is still a first in the dull drama scene.</p>
<h3>Acting Becomes Reality</h3>
<p>— Chou Cheng</p>
<p>Mr. Hong Songjiong, chairman of the local flower and plant trade association, is a man of many talents. In addition to excelling in painting and being skilled in medicine, he can also perform mouth tricks like a variety performer, such as making chicken crows and dog barks. The Shanghai Relief and Education Institute for Refugee Children is holding a charity performance, and he is the institute's doctor, so he is very busy with receptions. On the fifth day, because there was not enough half an hour for various performances, he was moved by the scene and used his mouth tricks to perform a one-act play "Tears of Refugees." He temporarily dressed up as a refugee woman, and a child from the institute played the refugee woman's son. Because her husband was bombed to death, she went out to beg, staying in the fields, with dogs barking at night, which was extremely desolate. At dawn, the rooster crowed, and the plane came again. The woman was pregnant and fled with her son. In a panic, she suddenly gave birth, suffering from hunger and cold, with nothing. The mother and son held the child and begged for help, recounting the circumstances of the disaster. The refugee child felt the pain personally and cried in tears, which was unbearable to see. The audience was very moved. Some even cried along with them. Mr. Hong's dog barks, chicken crows, children's cries, plane circling sounds, and the sound of machine guns firing and bombs falling were all lifelike, as if one was in the midst of it. Acting became reality, and everyone was saddened. So the audience threw banknotes and coins at the stage one after another. The host, fearing that the order would be disturbed, asked all the receptionists to come out and transfer the money for the audience who wanted to donate. As a result, a total of two hundred and three yuan, seven dimes, and eight cents was donated in national currency.</p>

<h3>The Formation of the New Art Reformed Peking Opera Troupe</h3>
<p>— Sheng</p>
<p>Regarding the New Art Reformed Peking Opera Troupe and the New Art Society, outsiders often cannot distinguish them clearly. I can describe the general situation of the New Art Reformed Peking Opera Troupe here.</p>
<p>During the autumn of last year, many young Peking Opera actors gathered together to prepare to organize a reformed Peking Opera troupe. Among them were Zhang Yipeng, Zhang Erpeng, Jin Suwen, Li Shunlai, Li Ruilai, Li Wenjun, He Yuru, Liang Cishan, and many others. They held several meetings and filled out application forms. Although it did not formally form, the name "New Art" was decided by this group of comrades at that time. Later, the New Art Society was established, divided into drama and Peking Opera groups. They filed with the Public Works Department. Li Shunlai, Li Wenjun, Liang Cishan, and He Yuru were in charge of the Peking Opera group, but none of them were established in the end.</p>
<p>Recently, Li Shunlai and others felt that they had to realize their wishes, so they organized a troupe with the core members of New Art and added Yu Sulian and a few others to form the "New Art Reformed Peking Opera Troupe" that is now going to Ningbo. Therefore, the backbone of the troupe are the basic members of the Peking Opera group of the New Art Society. They are using the name "New Art" because of this background.</p>
<h3>Shaw and Cathay Vie for "The Three Smiles," Cathay Willing to Concede</h3>
<p>— Hai Hu</p>
<p>Shaw's Yue Feng is directing "The Three Smiles," and it is rumored that Cathay also wants to film it. The incident of Shaw and Cathay vying to film "Zhao Wu Niang" last year is now being replayed today. However, according to reliable sources, Shaw has already asked Mr. Li to negotiate with Cathay. Shaw has already started filming, and three sets have been filmed so far. Although Cathay is in preparation, if Shaw is forced to stop, the losses would be huge. Therefore, they are making a request to Cathay, and Cathay's manager, Liu, out of courtesy, and seeing that Shaw has already started filming, expressed his willingness to give up. A dispute over filming has come to an end.</p>
